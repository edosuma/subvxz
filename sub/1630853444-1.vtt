WEBVTT

00:22.122 --> 00:24.190
- 5-910, unit 44.

00:24.257 --> 00:24.924
5-910, unit 44.

00:26.826 --> 00:27.560
5-910, unit 44.

03:39.619 --> 03:40.653
- Where are you going?

03:41.020 --> 03:42.055
- Did you take it?

03:42.622 --> 03:43.389
- Take what?

03:43.456 --> 03:46.192
- The money mother hides
up here, what else?

03:47.327 --> 03:47.827
- No.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.632
- Well it's not
fucking here, Devin.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.368
Goddammit.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.937
Where the fuck did she put it?

03:58.705 --> 04:00.106
- Someplace you won't find it.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.483
How are you?

04:14.520 --> 04:15.922
- Rehabilitated.

04:16.422 --> 04:16.990
Goodbye.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.125
- Four goddamn months.

04:20.126 --> 04:21.961
Four goddamn months
you've been gone, girl

04:22.028 --> 04:23.363
and this is the
best you can say?

04:24.163 --> 04:26.266
- What would you
like me to say, mother?

04:27.500 --> 04:28.368
- Well I don't know, Myca.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.670
How 'bout I'm sorry

04:30.903 --> 04:34.040
or I fucked up or I
won't do this again?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.242
I mean you know what
this does to your sister.

04:40.213 --> 04:40.713
- Sure.

04:41.814 --> 04:42.515
Whatever.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.337
- Just once, Devi.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.305
Don't follow her.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.050
- Mmm.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.019
Goddamn.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.822
- Surprised your sister
let you out so soon.

05:56.222 --> 05:57.924
I hear she's been
exceptionally fucked up

05:58.124 --> 05:59.158
since you took off.

06:01.794 --> 06:03.062
- Devin's fine.

06:03.129 --> 06:03.863
She's at home.

06:17.810 --> 06:18.878
It's 175.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.380
I tried to get more.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.181
- The deal was 350.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.216
- I know.

06:23.516 --> 06:24.617
I came up short.

06:25.918 --> 06:26.753
- I didn't hear that.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.122
Where in the fuck's the rest?

06:29.222 --> 06:32.625
- Hey, this is me you're
talking to, Caleb.

06:32.925 --> 06:35.328
Not one of your little
punk-ass speed freaks.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.131
I thought I could come
to you with this.

06:38.431 --> 06:38.998
- You can.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.336
Look, Myca. I can't
get busted again.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.340
If I'm gonna do this thing for
you, I gotta get what's mine.

06:52.712 --> 06:53.579
- Get on your knees.

06:54.113 --> 06:55.181
- What the fuck for?

06:56.516 --> 06:57.283
- Get

06:58.117 --> 06:58.684
on

06:59.318 --> 07:00.319
your knees.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.088
I need it, Caleb.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.157
Tomorrow night.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.392
- Yeah, that's what you said.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.595
- No excuses, no bullshit.

07:10.229 --> 07:10.730
Deal?

07:12.131 --> 07:12.632
- Yeah.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.000
Deal.

08:35.882 --> 08:36.382
- Jesus.

09:00.706 --> 09:01.207
Devin?

09:04.377 --> 09:04.877
Devin.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.654
Devin, come on.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.621
Devin, get up.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.156
Come on, Devin.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.324
Fuck.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.158
C'mon, Devin.

09:19.225 --> 09:19.725
Hey, hey, hey.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.428
Fuck.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.996
I'm sorry, Devin.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.964
I'm so fucking sorry I left.

09:25.031 --> 09:25.798
I'm sorry.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.900
I had to. I had to.

09:27.967 --> 09:28.467
Sorry.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.674
D, we're gonna be okay.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.610
You're gonna be fine.

09:37.677 --> 09:39.779
We're gonna start
over tomorrow, okay?

09:39.845 --> 09:40.546
Hey, we're gonna
start over tomorrow.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.448
Just you and me, okay?

09:42.915 --> 09:44.050
Just like it used to be.

09:44.116 --> 09:46.385
Just you and me, okay?

09:46.452 --> 09:47.720
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.085
- Do you think Leni'll be
mad about the bathroom?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.622
- She'll be
too sloshed to notice.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.225
And even if she does,
blame it on me.

10:59.525 --> 11:00.493
She'll believe it.

11:00.826 --> 11:01.327
- Thanks.

11:04.630 --> 11:05.965
- So when's band practice?

11:07.867 --> 11:08.367
-30.

11:09.101 --> 11:10.202
- Am I invited?

11:11.604 --> 11:15.341
- Sure. Just be cool, Myca.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.275
- Pssh, I'm cool.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.847
- So I'm standing there and
then this kid runs past me

11:21.914 --> 11:22.948
and knocks me on my ass.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.851
I'm like, "Whoa,
yesterday was 4/20.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.186
Today is Record Store Day.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.521
Get outta my way."

11:44.103 --> 11:44.537
- Chill, Sheila. Sit down.

11:44.603 --> 11:45.137
Sheila.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.544
What's she doin' here?

11:53.012 --> 11:54.880
I thought we had an agreement.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.550
- We said she could come back.

11:57.616 --> 11:59.452
- No, you said she
could come back.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.320
We, as in the
majority of the band

12:01.520 --> 12:03.355
said she can kick fucking rocks.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.424
- She came to say hi.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.127
- Hi, there's the door.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.261
- Guys, come on.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.162
- No, Gwen.

12:10.329 --> 12:11.731
How many times has this
chick skipped town

12:11.797 --> 12:13.265
and left us high and dry?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.334
Now I don't know about
the rest of you,

12:15.401 --> 12:17.770
but we have a gig at
Firebrand tomorrow night.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.573
And Devin, I love
you like family.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.642
But I'll be damned if you
let her fuck that up for us.

12:23.709 --> 12:25.444
- I'm right here, Rachel.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.813
You can talk that
shit to my face.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.183
- Rachel, don't-
- No, Gwen. Come on.

12:31.817 --> 12:32.718
Let her come.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.920
I don't give a fuck!

12:34.987 --> 12:35.488
- My way.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.227
That's how
it's gonna be, huh?

12:41.293 --> 12:41.861
Her over us?

12:44.330 --> 12:45.397
- She's my sister.

12:46.232 --> 12:46.799
Back

12:47.299 --> 12:47.867
off.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.502
- You know what, Rachel?

12:50.302 --> 12:51.270
You can just.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.073
Fuck.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.948
- Go on, chase her.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.383
That's what you do.

13:16.128 --> 13:16.862
- I'm here.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.838
- Stay away from us,
you wretched creature.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.496
- Oh, that one hurt.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.066
- Maybe you should
see the doctor.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.703
- Yeah, like we have
the money for that.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.208
No, I got it.

14:09.215 --> 14:09.715
Yeah.

14:14.119 --> 14:15.187
Do you have it?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.693
I'll call when I'm free.

14:21.126 --> 14:21.994
Be available.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.402
- You're not goin' out
tonight, are you?

14:31.237 --> 14:32.338
- Definitely not.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.465
- So you're
really not gonna tell me

14:59.531 --> 15:00.499
why you need this?

15:04.270 --> 15:04.770
- No.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.373
I'm not.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.240
- Right.

15:08.307 --> 15:08.807
Just curious.

15:12.511 --> 15:13.078
- Stay curious.

15:15.080 --> 15:15.948
- Myca, wait.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.383
- What?

15:17.449 --> 15:18.884
- I brought a few grams.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.286
- Okay.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.620
Bye.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.288
- Hey.

15:22.354 --> 15:22.855
- What?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.393
- You're just gonna
vanish again, aren't you?

15:27.459 --> 15:29.295
I mean that's what
you do, right?

15:29.361 --> 15:31.864
- Dude, fucking spare me.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.433
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.601
You know, this is
shit's gettin' old.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.870
Real old.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.871
Do you even want me or am
I just a fuck for favors?

15:40.472 --> 15:40.973
- Guess.

15:41.907 --> 15:42.875
Goodnight, Caleb.

15:45.511 --> 15:46.712
- No, fuck that!

15:46.912 --> 15:49.148
You're just like your
drunk slut mother.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.488
- I'll make this very simple.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.926
You're weak.

16:00.993 --> 16:05.297
You're a pushover and a
piss-poor drug dealer.

16:05.364 --> 16:08.300
You're good for a few grams.

16:08.367 --> 16:11.537
And if I think hard about
somebody else, a passable
orgasm.

16:13.939 --> 16:16.141
We are not

16:16.208 --> 16:17.876
friends.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.813
I do not want you.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.581
I don't care about you.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.855
You do favors for me
because you want to fuck me.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.459
That's what people do, Caleb.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.694
They use each other.

16:36.528 --> 16:37.696
So deal with it.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.968
And if you ever compare me
to my bitch mother again,

16:43.035 --> 16:46.205
I swear to fucking God

16:46.271 --> 16:47.306
I will incinerate you.

16:55.414 --> 16:55.914
We're done.

17:49.701 --> 17:50.202
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.573
- I guess you heard
about Sheila.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.475
- What about her?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.777
- She was popped for coke.

17:59.311 --> 18:00.813
Happened some time this morning.

18:02.614 --> 18:05.784
Landlord found it or
something, called the cops.

18:06.919 --> 18:07.486
- What?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.421
- She hasn't been charged yet,

18:09.621 --> 18:11.156
but they're holding
her overnight for sure.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.293
You're sure you
didn't know that?

18:14.927 --> 18:15.928
- I'm sure, Gwen.

18:17.629 --> 18:18.130
- Well.

18:19.331 --> 18:22.067
Look, I talked with Rachel.

18:23.001 --> 18:26.338
We don't like it, but Myca
can play the show tonight.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.307
She's our only option.

18:29.208 --> 18:33.912
But if she does something
to hurt the show

18:34.513 --> 18:36.548
or if we hear that she
had anything to do

18:36.615 --> 18:39.384
with what's going on
with Sheila, we're out.

18:40.319 --> 18:41.019
That's it.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.124
See ya tonight?

19:04.510 --> 19:06.111
- She shouldn't be here.

19:06.612 --> 19:07.579
- But she is.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.382
So let's just do what
we came here to do.

19:18.624 --> 19:20.592
- I can't believe we're
doing this, man.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.561
Fucking Firebrand.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.129
How many years did we talk about

19:24.329 --> 19:26.465
blowing the roof off this place?

19:29.101 --> 19:30.235
- How are you feeling?

19:31.603 --> 19:32.037
- I'll live.

19:32.104 --> 19:32.638
I'm fine.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.773
Really. Don't worry about me.

19:37.709 --> 19:38.944
- Can I ask you something?

19:39.311 --> 19:40.012
- Yeah, sure.

19:40.112 --> 19:40.679
What's up?

19:41.713 --> 19:42.848
- It's about Sheila.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.186
- What about Sheila?

19:47.786 --> 19:49.721
- Shatter
Machine, you're on in five.

22:38.323 --> 22:38.824
- Myca.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.877
- Well I hope it was
good for you, baby.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.479
'Cause we're done, ya hear me?

23:00.812 --> 23:01.880
Fucking done!

23:13.992 --> 23:15.727
- Myca.

23:16.595 --> 23:17.229
Myca, stop.

23:17.295 --> 23:17.796
Myca!

23:47.259 --> 23:47.759
Myca.

23:51.329 --> 23:51.830
Myca.

23:54.566 --> 23:55.066
Myca.

24:20.692 --> 24:21.193
Myca.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.463
- I just need more.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.617
I'm sorry you had to see that.

25:22.721 --> 25:25.190
I'm sorry I fucked up the show.

25:31.029 --> 25:31.897
I'm just sorry, Devin.

25:34.733 --> 25:35.700
For all of it.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.077
- What happened to you?

26:40.498 --> 26:41.099
- Thank you, Devi.

28:27.405 --> 28:27.872
No.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.310
No.

28:32.377 --> 28:32.877
No, no, no.

28:35.180 --> 28:37.348
Stop it.

28:40.151 --> 28:43.021
Stop it!

28:57.569 --> 28:58.069
Fuck.

29:01.072 --> 29:01.573
Fuck!

29:32.303 --> 29:33.638
- You really can't be here.

29:39.978 --> 29:40.445
- I can't do it.

29:40.512 --> 29:41.746
I can't handle this, D.

29:41.813 --> 29:44.249
I thought I could, but I can't.

29:44.516 --> 29:45.416
- What happened?

29:45.483 --> 29:50.021
- It got fucking worse
is what happened.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.226
- We have to do it.

29:55.293 --> 29:55.860
We have to.

29:55.927 --> 29:56.928
- Do what?

29:56.995 --> 29:58.630
- Kill her!

29:58.696 --> 29:59.964
The bitch that did this to me.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.300
- Myca.

30:02.367 --> 30:06.738
- You know, I thought if
anyone would understand,

30:06.805 --> 30:10.608
if anyone would have my back
no matter what, it'd be you.

30:10.675 --> 30:11.876
- I do have your back.

30:11.943 --> 30:14.579
- So help me make this right!

30:18.983 --> 30:21.386
- There's gotta be another way.

30:21.452 --> 30:24.756
- I told you nothing

30:24.823 --> 30:25.323
fucking works!

30:31.629 --> 30:32.297
I need you, D.

30:35.466 --> 30:38.203
I can't do this alone, not
all fucked up the way I am.

30:46.444 --> 30:47.145
- I think we should-
- We should what?

30:49.180 --> 30:49.681
- Get you help,

30:50.815 --> 30:52.016
real help.

30:55.320 --> 30:55.987
- Fuck you too.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.120
- Don't leave.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.335
- This all for you tonight?

32:17.402 --> 32:19.671
$1.60.

32:24.409 --> 32:26.144
- Oh, shit.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.279
I actually do need
some drain cleaner.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.848
Would you grab that for me?

32:30.915 --> 32:32.050
- Do you need
any brand in particular?

32:32.116 --> 32:33.117
- Just your cheapest.

32:33.318 --> 32:34.385
- I know just the one.

32:58.609 --> 33:00.445
- Caleb, what the fuck?

33:00.511 --> 33:01.879
- I should ask you
the same thing,

33:02.113 --> 33:04.148
stealing my shit and giving
it to some little bitch

33:04.315 --> 33:05.917
who goes off and gets busted.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.051
With my drugs?

33:07.318 --> 33:07.919
That's low, Myca.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.887
Even for a cunt like you.

33:09.954 --> 33:11.589
- What are you talking about?

33:11.823 --> 33:12.724
- Sheila Wagner.

33:13.024 --> 33:15.259
She got busted with the
shit that you took from me

33:15.326 --> 33:18.062
and now people are asking
questions, the wrong people.

33:18.830 --> 33:19.797
- I don't have time for this.

33:25.036 --> 33:25.536
- You're gonna make time.

33:27.772 --> 33:29.207
- What do you want
from me, Caleb?

33:29.273 --> 33:29.774
An apology?

33:32.910 --> 33:34.278
- No, you fucked up
this time, Myca.

33:34.912 --> 33:36.414
You fucked up real bad.

33:41.252 --> 33:41.753
- Shit!

33:54.098 --> 33:54.999
- Cut her off.

33:55.066 --> 33:55.900
Don't let her get away.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.399
I didn't want this, Myca.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.701
But you, you made me do this.

34:32.503 --> 34:33.538
I wanted you.

34:33.604 --> 34:36.407
I did everything I could for
you and what do you do for me?

34:37.608 --> 34:39.210
You spit in my face!

34:40.211 --> 34:41.079
You bitch!

34:43.514 --> 34:45.249
What's so goddamn funny?

34:47.285 --> 34:48.586
- You're fucking pathetic.

34:51.189 --> 34:51.689
- Fuck you, Myca.

36:43.201 --> 36:43.834
- Hey.

36:43.901 --> 36:44.702
Reach up.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.122
Finally.

37:06.724 --> 37:07.291
Fuck!

37:17.101 --> 37:18.369
- Myca.

37:18.436 --> 37:19.337
Myca, please get in.

37:21.639 --> 37:22.206
Myca, please.

37:24.008 --> 37:24.642
- Fuck off.

37:24.709 --> 37:25.943
- Myca, please stop.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.984
- Why, so you can take me
somewhere to get me real help?

37:33.117 --> 37:33.884
Fuck you.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.188
- I'm sorry.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.723
I'm sorry I said that.

37:38.789 --> 37:39.290
Myca.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.163
Get in the car please?

37:46.931 --> 37:48.199
I was wrong, okay?

37:50.034 --> 37:50.534
- You were?
- Yes.

37:55.640 --> 37:56.841
- If you try to take me
home or back to town,

37:56.907 --> 38:00.144
I swear I will jump right
out of this fucking thing.

38:00.211 --> 38:00.711
- I know.

38:26.203 --> 38:31.008
- You were there last
night in the alley, right?

38:35.813 --> 38:38.249
I wasn't sure if I
dreamed that part or not.

38:40.217 --> 38:40.918
- I was there.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.290
What happened to Caleb?

38:48.626 --> 38:49.460
- I bit him.

38:54.932 --> 38:56.000
His goon showed and
fucking split.

39:02.206 --> 39:03.341
- You left me there.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.547
- I'm sorry.

39:09.613 --> 39:10.781
- And you're leaving me now.

39:13.718 --> 39:16.454
- I don't have a choice, D.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.557
I'm doing this with
or without you.

39:20.925 --> 39:22.093
I mean look at me.

39:26.630 --> 39:27.765
- I can't lose you again.

39:35.406 --> 39:36.607
- Then don't.

40:59.323 --> 40:59.824
Shit.

43:00.511 --> 43:01.912
- Hey Gwen?

43:04.114 --> 43:05.082
I need a favor.

43:08.118 --> 43:12.189
I need you to look after Leni
for a few days, maybe longer.

43:16.660 --> 43:17.328
Myca and I,

43:20.297 --> 43:21.799
we had to leave town for awhile.

43:21.865 --> 43:24.234
I just need know that she'll
be okay when we're gone.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.005
Can you do it or not?

43:31.709 --> 43:32.276
Thanks.

43:33.344 --> 43:34.411
Key's under the rug.

44:18.722 --> 44:20.324
- No matter what happens,

44:21.325 --> 44:23.861
no matter what you see,

44:25.529 --> 44:27.665
no matter how fucked
up things get in there,

44:27.731 --> 44:29.700
you cannot black out.

44:30.934 --> 44:34.004
If you go down, I won't
be able to pull you out.

44:34.805 --> 44:38.876
Just do everything that
I said and we'll be okay.

44:45.315 --> 44:47.418
It'll be over soon, I promise.

44:51.522 --> 44:52.690
- I have to tell you something.

44:59.029 --> 44:59.963
- Tell me when it's over.

46:37.928 --> 46:38.595
Wait here.

48:01.311 --> 48:02.045
No.

48:04.181 --> 48:04.681
No.

48:06.416 --> 48:06.917
No.

48:27.271 --> 48:27.771
Goddammit!

48:37.714 --> 48:39.716
Goddamn you.

49:00.304 --> 49:02.105
- Girl runs
away from home,

49:02.406 --> 49:04.374
moves to the big
city to start over.

49:04.808 --> 49:07.411
Blows through all of her
cash in about a week,

49:08.011 --> 49:10.280
starts hustling to try
to make it all back.

49:11.815 --> 49:12.516
Am I warm?

50:22.686 --> 50:23.820
- Myca?

50:23.887 --> 50:24.388
- No!

50:26.923 --> 50:28.859
- Myca, stop!
- Fuck you!

50:28.925 --> 50:29.593
- Myca!
- Fuck you!

50:32.195 --> 50:32.763
- Myca, stop!
- No!

50:35.165 --> 50:35.732
- Myca, stop!
- No!

50:37.167 --> 50:39.936
No!

51:15.305 --> 51:17.941
- You've reached the
voice mailbox of Gloria Olsen,

51:18.208 --> 51:20.577
chief financial officer
of Olsen & Wail.

51:21.311 --> 51:22.279
I'll be out of town

51:22.345 --> 51:24.848
for the remainder of the
month on personal leave.

51:24.915 --> 51:26.249
If this is an emergency,

51:26.316 --> 51:29.086
you may reach me at my
home in Browning, Ohio.

51:29.152 --> 51:32.089
The number there
is 216-675-7754.

51:34.925 --> 51:36.226
Thank you and have a nice day.

51:53.110 --> 51:54.244
- I'm going, D.

51:56.012 --> 51:56.947
To Ohio.

51:59.749 --> 52:02.986
If you don't wanna
come, I understand.

52:05.222 --> 52:06.523
- I'm not leaving you.

52:08.325 --> 52:09.826
- You freaked, D.

52:11.328 --> 52:13.230
You almost didn't make it out.

52:16.399 --> 52:16.900
- You almost didn't either.

52:25.509 --> 52:26.977
What happened back there?

52:37.721 --> 52:40.624
- What do you see
when you black out?

52:46.029 --> 52:47.597
- You've never asked
me that before.

52:49.199 --> 52:49.699
- I'm asking now.

52:55.605 --> 52:56.573
- Mostly it's

52:58.808 --> 52:59.910
just black.

53:04.915 --> 53:07.050
Sometimes I see my dad and

53:10.120 --> 53:12.756
the stuff he did
to me and my mom.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.794
- I know about seeing
fucked up stuff.

53:19.229 --> 53:22.999
Ever since this shit started,
I keep having these goddamn.

53:26.303 --> 53:27.337
I don't know what they are.

53:29.306 --> 53:33.510
Sometimes I'm not even
asleep yet and I see it.

53:35.212 --> 53:36.213
- See what?

53:39.216 --> 53:40.717
- The bedroom I grew up in,

53:42.619 --> 53:44.287
the one on Melrose.

53:44.821 --> 53:47.757
You know with the
ugly wallpaper.

53:51.027 --> 53:52.262
We used to call it-

53:52.329 --> 53:53.096
- The violet room.

53:55.732 --> 53:56.466
I remember.

53:58.501 --> 54:01.404
- Yeah, the violet room.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.511
I keep picturing
myself there, D.

54:10.313 --> 54:12.749
And there's all of
these people just

54:13.817 --> 54:16.620
fucking ripping me apart.

54:18.121 --> 54:23.460
There's blood everywhere and
I look for someone to help me,

54:23.526 --> 54:25.528
but there's no one there.

54:29.666 --> 54:30.600
I'm alone.

54:35.805 --> 54:36.906
- The next time you're there,

54:39.909 --> 54:40.543
find me.

54:57.894 --> 55:00.397
- There
was the old magic sign.

55:00.463 --> 55:01.965
Much of this man won't let
him, God rest her soul.

55:02.032 --> 55:03.366
- Don't you got anywhere to be?

55:05.702 --> 55:07.971
- It's cool, Mrs. Murray.

55:08.038 --> 55:08.938
My shift doesn't start
for another hour.

55:11.541 --> 55:13.043
- You know you don't gotta
look after me like this, right?

55:13.109 --> 55:17.514
- Yeah, well I think it's
what Devin would want.

55:22.118 --> 55:22.852
- You heard from her?

55:24.020 --> 55:25.188
- Not since the other day.

55:32.762 --> 55:37.500
- Goddamn, Myca.

55:37.567 --> 55:38.535
You know, she's only
been back a week

55:38.601 --> 55:39.869
and she's already been
spewin' her venom.

55:41.705 --> 55:42.906
- I'm sure they're fine.

55:43.540 --> 55:45.375
They probably just went to
catch a show or somethin'.

55:47.010 --> 55:47.811
- Mm-mmm.

55:47.877 --> 55:50.013
No, no.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.047
It ain't like Devi to just
up and leave like that.

55:51.114 --> 55:52.048
It ain't like her at all.

55:54.417 --> 55:59.522
No, whatever those two girls
are up to, it's trouble.

56:46.903 --> 56:49.139
- You don't have to bring
her everywhere, you know?

56:49.606 --> 56:51.207
We'll be gone two seconds.

56:57.414 --> 56:58.014
Come on.

57:09.359 --> 57:10.193
- I need smokes.

57:10.260 --> 57:10.760
Grab my brand?

57:44.961 --> 57:47.597
- All right, this is a robbery!

57:47.664 --> 57:49.332
All right, man. Cash
in the bag right now.

57:49.399 --> 57:50.300
Stop starin' and start stuffin'!

57:55.104 --> 57:55.538
- Shit.

57:55.605 --> 57:57.273
Devin, fuck.

57:57.907 --> 57:58.374
- You got a car outside?

57:58.708 --> 57:59.242
- No, no, no.

57:59.309 --> 57:59.843
- You, you got a car?

57:59.909 --> 58:00.610
You got a car outside?

58:00.677 --> 58:01.511
C'mon, keys right now.

58:29.205 --> 58:29.706
- Myca?

58:39.015 --> 58:39.549
- I'm here.

58:43.119 --> 58:43.987
- What happened?

58:45.021 --> 58:47.924
- You had a total
shit attack is what happened.

58:50.827 --> 58:51.761
- Where are we?

58:55.231 --> 58:56.432
- See for yourself.

59:04.407 --> 59:06.843
The cops showed up,
so I had to split.

59:07.110 --> 59:09.279
I had to haul your ass
all the way here.

59:11.314 --> 59:11.814
- The car.

59:12.315 --> 59:13.349
What happened to the car?

59:13.616 --> 59:14.484
- It's gone.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.485
- But Bella was
in the car, Myca.

59:19.789 --> 59:20.857
I have to get her back.

59:20.924 --> 59:21.858
We have to get her back.

59:21.925 --> 59:22.425
- Hey!

59:23.726 --> 59:27.297
My entire livelihood
was in that car.

59:27.430 --> 59:29.165
My bag, the guns,

59:29.332 --> 59:32.201
not to mention almost
all of our goddamn money.

59:33.603 --> 59:38.274
In a few hours, I'm going
to be seriously fucked,

59:38.808 --> 59:40.176
so spare me.

59:44.380 --> 59:44.948
- What are we gonna do?

59:45.014 --> 59:45.648
What are we gonna do?

59:56.125 --> 59:56.626
What if he pawns her?

59:58.361 --> 1:00:00.630
- Then we'll buy her back.

1:00:00.930 --> 1:00:02.131
- What if we don't
have the money?

1:00:03.199 --> 1:00:04.400
- Then we'll steal it.

1:00:04.467 --> 1:00:06.836
- What if we never find the car?

1:00:07.971 --> 1:00:10.340
- D, I need you to stop
with the 20 questions

1:00:10.406 --> 1:00:11.441
like right now.

1:00:13.910 --> 1:00:14.611
- But I don't-

1:00:14.811 --> 1:00:16.879
- I said shut up!

1:00:34.897 --> 1:00:35.898
Fuck

1:00:35.965 --> 1:00:37.266
you!

1:02:24.407 --> 1:02:25.908
- Are you feeling any better?

1:03:06.716 --> 1:03:07.717
How do you feel?

1:03:17.727 --> 1:03:19.395
I wish there was
something I could do.

1:03:23.599 --> 1:03:24.801
- You could take a shower.

1:03:25.701 --> 1:03:27.303
You reek like shit.

1:04:28.231 --> 1:04:29.398
- Myca, I thought.

1:04:31.334 --> 1:04:33.636
Myca?

1:06:23.012 --> 1:06:23.946
- Myca.

1:06:24.513 --> 1:06:25.581
- What did you do?

1:06:39.028 --> 1:06:40.963
- It's like I
wasn't even there.

1:06:41.530 --> 1:06:43.566
I don't even know
how I got there.

1:06:43.733 --> 1:06:44.233
- I know.

1:06:44.367 --> 1:06:46.268
- No, you don't.

1:06:46.836 --> 1:06:48.437
- I mean I believe you.

1:06:49.405 --> 1:06:51.607
- Oh god, I picked
that guy's face off.

1:06:51.674 --> 1:06:53.042
What are we?

1:06:53.109 --> 1:06:54.710
Oh my god, we don't have a car.

1:06:54.910 --> 1:06:56.245
We're almost out of money.

1:06:56.312 --> 1:06:58.748
Oh my god, we're stranded here.

1:06:58.814 --> 1:07:00.149
Motherfucker.

1:07:00.516 --> 1:07:04.220
If I ever get my hands
on that piece of shit-

1:07:04.286 --> 1:07:05.755
- You'll be fine.

1:07:08.924 --> 1:07:11.761
- I'm gonna do it again, D.

1:07:11.827 --> 1:07:13.029
I know I'm going to.

1:07:14.130 --> 1:07:15.631
I can't stop myself.

1:07:15.698 --> 1:07:16.732
I'm gonna do it again.

1:07:18.901 --> 1:07:21.170
Oh my god, I'm so fucked.

1:07:23.406 --> 1:07:25.374
I'm so fucked.

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:35.051
Devin, no.

1:07:36.986 --> 1:07:39.522
- If I'd had done it earlier,

1:07:39.588 --> 1:07:42.058
you wouldn't have hurt that
guy today, so I'm doing it now.

1:07:42.124 --> 1:07:43.259
- I said no.

1:07:43.726 --> 1:07:46.062
- You can't hurt
an yone else, Myca.

1:07:47.029 --> 1:07:48.564
You don't have a choice.

1:07:56.105 --> 1:07:57.740
- What if I give it to you?

1:08:00.676 --> 1:08:01.644
- We'll be the same.

1:10:30.826 --> 1:10:32.494
- You stole a car yesterday.

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:34.630
I need to know where it is.

1:10:34.697 --> 1:10:36.265
- Bitch, I didn't steal
a fucking car.

1:10:36.332 --> 1:10:38.100
- My sister is sick.

1:10:38.167 --> 1:10:39.468
Her medicine is in that car.

1:10:39.535 --> 1:10:41.103
- I can't do it.

1:10:41.170 --> 1:10:42.838
They'll fucking kill
me if I don't fuckin'.

1:10:42.905 --> 1:10:43.872
Fine!

1:10:43.939 --> 1:10:45.140
Boone.

1:10:45.207 --> 1:10:45.808
Boone has it!

1:10:45.874 --> 1:10:46.809
Fuck!

1:10:46.875 --> 1:10:48.611
- Where is he?

1:10:48.677 --> 1:10:50.446
- He told me to do this.

1:10:50.512 --> 1:10:52.481
He's bad people.

1:10:52.548 --> 1:10:53.048
- So am I.

1:10:56.418 --> 1:10:56.885
- I wanna
hit line drive.

1:11:09.565 --> 1:11:11.700
- Where the fuck have you been?

1:11:12.801 --> 1:11:13.969
- I found our stuff.

1:11:30.219 --> 1:11:31.920
- There.

1:11:31.987 --> 1:11:33.355
- He said the keys
would be in the trailer.

1:11:33.422 --> 1:11:34.757
- Let me worry about that.

1:11:36.392 --> 1:11:36.859
- Myca.

1:11:38.027 --> 1:11:39.928
- Wait for me by the car.

1:11:40.429 --> 1:11:41.930
- You're not going
in there alone.

1:11:42.531 --> 1:11:43.832
- I'll be two minutes.

1:11:44.233 --> 1:11:44.800
Be there.

1:12:19.635 --> 1:12:21.003
- Where the fuck is Wade?

1:12:21.070 --> 1:12:22.237
- Piss Bane's bar got one of
them titty bar.

1:12:25.341 --> 1:12:26.642
- Bucket of bolts and a couple
of 50s on a smash and grab

1:12:26.709 --> 1:12:27.209
ain't fuckin' cuttin' it.

1:12:30.879 --> 1:12:31.380
Motherfucker owes me 600.

1:12:43.158 --> 1:12:44.793
If that pussy skips town,
I'm gonna skin him alive.

1:12:44.860 --> 1:12:45.427
I swear to Christ.

1:12:47.429 --> 1:12:49.631
- He ain't skippin' town, man.

1:12:49.698 --> 1:12:51.300
That dude worships you like
you John Wayne or somethin'.

1:12:51.367 --> 1:12:53.769
You just bein' paranoid.

1:12:53.836 --> 1:12:55.003
- Fuck you say to me?

1:12:55.070 --> 1:12:55.971
- I didn't say nothin'.

1:12:56.038 --> 1:12:56.672
- Huh?
- What'd I say?

1:12:56.739 --> 1:12:57.339
What'd I say, Boone?

1:12:57.406 --> 1:12:58.741
- What am I, motherfucker?

1:12:58.907 --> 1:13:00.109
Huh? What am I?

1:13:00.175 --> 1:13:01.477
- You're god, man.

1:13:01.543 --> 1:13:04.279
Boone is god. Boone is god.

1:14:46.515 --> 1:14:47.449
- Fuck it. I'm callin' worse.

1:15:12.374 --> 1:15:13.542
C'mon, fucking pick up.

1:15:24.419 --> 1:15:25.587
Come on, motherfucker.

1:15:28.123 --> 1:15:28.624
Goddammit.

1:15:32.294 --> 1:15:33.128
C'mon, motherfucker.

1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:40.869
- Motherfucker!

1:15:40.936 --> 1:15:42.137
Enough!

1:15:42.204 --> 1:15:44.139
- You little bitch.

1:15:44.206 --> 1:15:44.940
- No!

1:15:47.309 --> 1:15:48.544
- What the fuck?

1:15:55.450 --> 1:15:56.952
- Oh, you're gonna
fuckin' die now.

1:15:57.719 --> 1:15:58.720
You fuckin' bitch.

1:16:11.867 --> 1:16:14.436
Goddammit, I'ma
fucking kill you.

1:16:36.391 --> 1:16:38.527
- Boone, man. What the
hell's goin' on in there?

1:16:38.594 --> 1:16:40.429
What you got, one of them
whores down from the strip club?

1:16:40.495 --> 1:16:41.663
Open up there now, come on.

1:16:43.732 --> 1:16:45.367
Dang it!

1:16:45.434 --> 1:16:47.669
- Keys! Where the
fuck are my keys?

1:16:47.736 --> 1:16:48.770
- Guess they're in the
fuckin' drawer, man.

1:16:48.837 --> 1:16:50.439
They're in the goddamn cabinet.

1:16:50.505 --> 1:16:52.341
Fuck, you broke my arm,

1:16:52.407 --> 1:16:55.010
you skeezy-ass fuckin' bitch!

1:16:55.077 --> 1:16:56.845
You broke my fuckin' arm, bitch.

1:17:01.249 --> 1:17:02.484
Hell, she broke my fuckin' arm.

1:17:05.020 --> 1:17:06.321
- Devin, open up.

1:17:07.222 --> 1:17:07.723
Fuck.

1:17:10.792 --> 1:17:12.127
Okay, okay.

1:17:12.194 --> 1:17:12.794
What the fuck?

1:17:12.861 --> 1:17:13.996
Fuck.

1:17:38.754 --> 1:17:39.254
Fuck!

1:17:49.731 --> 1:17:51.767
- Mrs. Murray, you
wanna watch some TV?

1:17:55.604 --> 1:17:56.738
"Rockford Files" is on.

1:17:56.805 --> 1:17:59.775
- I don't wanna watch the
fuckin' "Rockford Files", Gwen.

1:18:00.509 --> 1:18:02.310
I want my daughters home.

1:18:03.612 --> 1:18:04.379
- They'll be here.

1:18:07.115 --> 1:18:09.251
- I don't think they
will, you know?

1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:13.989
I just got this feeling all
of a sudden that this is it.

1:18:15.857 --> 1:18:19.661
- I know you and
Myca have issues,

1:18:19.728 --> 1:18:22.831
but Devin wouldn't
leave you like that.

1:18:24.066 --> 1:18:27.903
- Devi will do anything Myca
tells her to, you know that.

1:18:28.103 --> 1:18:29.237
- Still, I don't think that-

1:18:29.304 --> 1:18:31.239
- Then where the hell is she?

1:18:33.709 --> 1:18:35.944
I suppose I deserve it.

1:18:38.613 --> 1:18:39.147
I got to thinkin'.

1:18:41.316 --> 1:18:41.817
I was thinkin'

1:18:43.785 --> 1:18:47.856
when them king-shit doctors
up at that fancy rehab

1:18:48.190 --> 1:18:50.859
went diggin' around in
my daughter's brains

1:18:50.926 --> 1:18:52.961
and they went and they
dug into some stuff

1:18:53.028 --> 1:18:54.629
maybe they shouldn't
have been diggin' in to.

1:18:57.399 --> 1:18:59.835
Maybe they found somethin's
gon' make her hate me

1:18:59.901 --> 1:19:01.536
more than she already does.

1:19:03.004 --> 1:19:03.505
Devi too.

1:19:05.307 --> 1:19:09.211
I think they just left my sad,
miserable ass here to rot.

1:19:20.455 --> 1:19:21.990
I just wanna make it
all right, you know?

1:19:22.891 --> 1:19:23.959
I just wanna make it
all right.

1:19:24.025 --> 1:19:25.560
- Make what all right?

1:19:32.634 --> 1:19:33.235
- Oh nevermind, Gwenneth.

1:19:34.703 --> 1:19:36.004
It's all right.

1:19:36.071 --> 1:19:39.074
I'm just shit-ass
drunk, you know?

1:19:41.409 --> 1:19:43.145
I need some time to rest.

1:19:49.050 --> 1:19:49.584
You go on home.

1:19:49.651 --> 1:19:50.452
Go on home.

1:19:50.519 --> 1:19:51.453
You can just check
on me tomorrow.

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:52.020
It's fine.

1:20:24.419 --> 1:20:24.920
- D.

1:20:28.623 --> 1:20:29.858
D, there it is.

1:20:49.945 --> 1:20:50.445
We'll camp here tonight.

1:20:51.613 --> 1:20:53.348
Then in the morning,
we'll do it.

1:21:07.429 --> 1:21:08.897
Shit.

1:21:08.964 --> 1:21:10.932
Completely missed.

1:21:10.999 --> 1:21:12.234
Must've been the wind.

1:21:12.300 --> 1:21:12.801
- Must be

1:21:15.604 --> 1:21:16.838
- Okay, smart ass.

1:21:16.905 --> 1:21:17.906
Why don't you try?

1:21:19.241 --> 1:21:19.741
- No.

1:21:21.109 --> 1:21:22.444
- Nobody can hear us.

1:21:22.911 --> 1:21:24.012
- I said no.

1:21:25.313 --> 1:21:26.548
- How am I supposed to trust

1:21:26.615 --> 1:21:28.416
that you will help me
take this bitch out

1:21:28.516 --> 1:21:31.119
if you won't even shoot the gun?

1:21:35.056 --> 1:21:35.557
C'mere.

1:21:37.225 --> 1:21:38.860
I said come here.

1:22:19.768 --> 1:22:20.702
- I'm so sorry, baby.

1:22:22.971 --> 1:22:23.438
I'm so sorry.

1:23:27.736 --> 1:23:28.236
- It's time.

1:24:32.767 --> 1:24:33.268
Devin?

1:24:35.837 --> 1:24:36.504
Devin, get in here.

1:24:50.952 --> 1:24:55.490
Fuck!

1:24:56.724 --> 1:24:59.194
Where the fuck are you?

1:27:37.852 --> 1:27:38.419
"I won't be you."

1:28:23.331 --> 1:28:23.831
- Hey.

1:28:30.638 --> 1:28:31.139
Reach out.

1:28:39.981 --> 1:28:40.481
My name's Devin.

1:28:42.283 --> 1:28:42.784
What's yours?

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:47.488
No one is gonna hurt you.

1:28:47.722 --> 1:28:48.923
Can you tell me your name?

1:28:51.359 --> 1:28:51.859
- Cecilia.

1:28:52.827 --> 1:28:53.728
- Have you been here alone long?

1:28:55.730 --> 1:28:58.866
- Aunt Gloria bit me,
then she had an accident.

1:29:02.003 --> 1:29:04.806
- I'm gonna need you
to come with me, okay?

1:29:05.406 --> 1:29:06.274
- Get away from her, Devin.

1:29:08.109 --> 1:29:10.812
Get away from her now.

1:29:12.914 --> 1:29:14.549
- Myca.

1:29:14.615 --> 1:29:16.651
- Get away from her now.

1:29:16.718 --> 1:29:18.753
- Please put the gun down.

1:29:19.020 --> 1:29:21.389
- I said move.

1:29:21.456 --> 1:29:22.757
She's got it.
- Myca.

1:29:22.824 --> 1:29:23.324
Myca, stop.

1:29:25.993 --> 1:29:26.994
- Devin, move.

1:29:28.463 --> 1:29:28.963
- No.

1:29:30.898 --> 1:29:34.435
- She's a fucking
monster, just like Gloria.

1:29:34.502 --> 1:29:35.937
I can smell it on her.

1:29:37.605 --> 1:29:38.573
- Can't you see?

1:29:40.208 --> 1:29:41.342
She's one of us.

1:29:44.812 --> 1:29:47.782
She's just like us.

1:29:50.485 --> 1:29:51.119
It's over, Myca.

1:29:53.921 --> 1:29:55.390
It's time to go home.

1:29:57.225 --> 1:29:58.993
There's no monsters left.

1:30:00.027 --> 1:30:01.028
It's just us.

1:30:50.077 --> 1:30:51.078
Be better than us.

1:31:27.615 --> 1:31:28.416
I'll be back.

1:31:45.900 --> 1:31:46.868
Hey, it's Devin.

1:31:48.202 --> 1:31:49.570
Yeah, we're fine.

1:31:50.605 --> 1:31:51.272
I called home.

1:31:51.339 --> 1:31:52.940
Nobody answered.

1:31:53.007 --> 1:31:55.142
I just wanted to make
sure that Leni was okay.

1:32:32.547 --> 1:32:33.247
- Where'd you go?

1:32:41.622 --> 1:32:42.657
Devin, where did you go?

1:32:47.862 --> 1:32:49.730
- Leni's gone.

1:32:49.797 --> 1:32:51.299
- What?

1:32:51.365 --> 1:32:52.199
- Leni, she's gone.

1:32:55.002 --> 1:32:55.503
- Gone where?

1:32:56.837 --> 1:32:57.338
- She OD'd, Myca.

1:33:00.441 --> 1:33:00.942
Some time last night.

1:33:02.043 --> 1:33:03.110
Gwen just told me.

1:33:31.973 --> 1:33:33.274
How can you laugh at that?

1:33:34.809 --> 1:33:37.945
- Because she was total shit.

1:33:38.012 --> 1:33:38.579
- You don't mean that.

1:33:41.115 --> 1:33:42.350
- Oh, I don't.

1:33:43.317 --> 1:33:44.285
- She was our mother.

1:33:44.919 --> 1:33:45.753
We weren't there.

1:33:45.920 --> 1:33:46.954
Now she's gone.

1:33:48.956 --> 1:33:50.758
- Lemme ask you
something, Devin.

1:33:52.627 --> 1:33:57.064
How well did you really
know our mother?

1:33:57.131 --> 1:33:58.766
- Myca, stop.

1:33:58.833 --> 1:34:01.669
- That woman, that cunt.

1:34:02.303 --> 1:34:07.174
She let her crackhead
boyfriends fuck me for drugs.

1:34:07.908 --> 1:34:12.446
She cared more about the junk
than her own fucking daughter.

1:34:17.318 --> 1:34:17.818
And then there's you,

1:34:20.721 --> 1:34:22.757
her little servant.

1:34:22.823 --> 1:34:23.624
- Myca.

1:34:23.691 --> 1:34:27.862
- You ever wonder why
she took you in, huh?

1:34:28.329 --> 1:34:32.366
Why that crackhead took you in,

1:34:32.433 --> 1:34:37.138
another little shit that
she couldn't even afford?

1:34:37.204 --> 1:34:37.705
- Stop it!

1:34:40.608 --> 1:34:42.143
- She thought she could make up

1:34:42.209 --> 1:34:46.747
for everything that happened
to me by adopting you,

1:34:47.715 --> 1:34:49.250
another little fuck up.

1:34:53.220 --> 1:34:55.690
Funny,

1:34:55.756 --> 1:34:58.959
the only thing that
ever made us sisters

1:34:59.026 --> 1:35:03.130
was that old whore's guilt.

1:35:10.071 --> 1:35:11.872
No!

1:36:21.742 --> 1:36:22.243
Jesus Christ.

1:37:56.303 --> 1:37:56.737
Devin,

1:37:56.804 --> 1:37:57.304
what can I say?

1:37:58.472 --> 1:37:58.973
It's over.

1:38:00.207 --> 1:38:02.710
You made the right call
cutting loose of this.

1:38:06.413 --> 1:38:07.181
Me and you,

1:38:08.816 --> 1:38:10.050
it just shouldn't be.

1:38:12.753 --> 1:38:13.254
Not anymore,

1:38:15.522 --> 1:38:16.557
not like this.

1:38:19.326 --> 1:38:20.995
I can't stop what's inside me.

1:38:21.528 --> 1:38:22.529
I know that now.

1:38:25.733 --> 1:38:27.334
When this thing
catches up to me,

1:38:28.402 --> 1:38:30.170
you can't be there.

1:38:31.872 --> 1:38:33.407
I gotta do this on my own.

1:38:36.210 --> 1:38:37.945
But you had my back,
little sister.

1:38:40.314 --> 1:38:41.282
You always have.

1:38:45.519 --> 1:38:49.790
I hope you start a new
band, write more songs.

1:38:52.026 --> 1:38:53.994
I hope you see the world, Devin.

1:38:55.930 --> 1:38:58.565
Do all the shit we
talked about growing up.

1:39:01.602 --> 1:39:04.738
Mother and I won't be there
to hold you back anymore.

1:39:32.533 --> 1:39:34.335
- Know this: I
didn't mean what I said.

1:39:36.303 --> 1:39:38.238
We are sisters

1:39:40.207 --> 1:39:41.675
and we always will be.

1:39:44.011 --> 1:39:46.180
No amount of distance
can change that.

1:39:49.550 --> 1:39:51.018
Love,

1:39:51.085 --> 1:39:51.585
Myca.

1:41:26.713 --> 1:41:30.284
- PS, the
next time I'm there

1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:33.954
in the bad place,

1:41:36.023 --> 1:41:37.057
in the violet room,

1:41:41.028 --> 1:41:42.429
I'll do just like you said.

1:41:47.101 --> 1:41:47.868
I'll find you.
