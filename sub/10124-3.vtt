WEBVTT

00:07.600 --> 00:11.300
OH, ERIC, YES.
THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.900
DON'T STOP.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.800
O.K., WE FOUND MY BROTHER.

00:17.033 --> 00:19.900
THIS PERSONALITY PROFILE
OF OUR NEW PRINCIPAL

00:19.900 --> 00:21.300
IS SUPERLATIVE.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.967
THE MAN LIVES NEXT DOOR.

00:22.967 --> 00:24.367
GLAD I COULD
GIVE SOME HELP.

00:24.367 --> 00:26.900
YES, WELL, YOU
GIVE A WONDERFUL
NECK MASSAGE.

00:26.900 --> 00:30.467
YOU KNOW, MOLLY,
I'M MORE THAN JUST A PAIR
OF STRONG, MASCULINE HANDS.

00:30.467 --> 00:32.867
WELL, OF COURSE YOU ARE,
MY LITTLE CABANA BOY.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.200
WELL, <i>FINIS! </i>

00:36.200 --> 00:38.700
HA HA! NO, NO.
IT'S FEENY.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.967
HIS NAME IS FEENY.

00:40.967 --> 00:43.900
<i>FINIS </i>IS FRENCH
FOR FINISHED.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.233
AH, THE FRENCH.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.900
OUR NEIGHBORS
TO THE NORTH.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.600
HELLO.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.800
NOT NOW,
I'M WORKING.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.400
YOU SAID
YOU'D DRIVE US HOME.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.567
AAH!

00:54.567 --> 00:57.133
HEY, BABE,
YOU'RE WIGGING OUT
THE RATS.

00:58.300 --> 00:59.500
RATS?

00:59.500 --> 01:01.300
YEAH, WE'RE STUDYING
NATURAL SELECTION.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.900
WE'RE GONNA SEE IF RATS
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN NATURAL CHEDDAR

01:03.900 --> 01:06.200
AND "I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S NOT CHEESE."

01:06.200 --> 01:10.133
YEP, OUR D-PLUS
RESTS ON FURRY
LITTLE SHAWN AND CORY.

01:10.133 --> 01:11.600
YOU NAMED THEM
AFTER YOURSELVES?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.600
SHAWN'S THE ONE
CHEWING THE LOCK.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.700
I'M THE ONE
WITH THE SKIN DISEASE.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.600
JUST KEEP YOUR LITTLE
VERMIN AWAY FROM

01:17.600 --> 01:18.967
TOMORROW'S EDITION
OF THE SCHOOL PAPER.

01:18.967 --> 01:21.900
COME ON, LET'S GO.
ALL FOUR OF YOU RATS.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.967
UM, ALL THREE
OF US RATS.

01:24.967 --> 01:27.133
LITTLE SHAWN BROKE OUT?

01:27.133 --> 01:28.834
I GOT HIM.

01:28.834 --> 01:31.233
HE WANTS TO KISS YOU.

01:31.233 --> 01:32.600
AAH!

01:32.600 --> 01:34.300
HE LOVES YOU.

01:34.300 --> 01:37.100
COME ON, YOU KISS
MY BROTHER.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.834
HEY, THANK YOU.

01:38.834 --> 01:39.934
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.567
I FINALLY GET A BRAINY GIRL
INTERESTED IN ME,

01:42.567 --> 01:44.100
AND YOU GUYS
SCREW IT UP.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.567
OH, PULL. HEH HEH.

01:49.567 --> 01:53.200
HEY, THAT FLOOR'S
REAL SLICK OUT THERE.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.200
AAH!

01:54.200 --> 01:55.734
[CRASH]

01:55.734 --> 01:57.200
GOOD.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.967
I GOT TO GET HOME.

01:59.967 --> 02:02.200
I PROMISED MOM
I'D CRACK HER BACK

02:02.200 --> 02:03.600
BEFORE
<i>AMERICAN GLADIATORS. </i>

02:04.767 --> 02:06.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, COR?

02:06.133 --> 02:08.600
CHECK IT OUT.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.000
HO HO HO!

02:11.000 --> 02:13.200
A SCREEN FULL OF FEEN.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.200
HE'S GOING TO BE
ON THE FRONT PAGE
OF THE SCHOOL PAPER?

02:16.200 --> 02:18.867
WON'T IT SCARE CHILDREN?

02:18.867 --> 02:20.767
IT WON'T SCARE
THEM IF HE'S...

02:22.100 --> 02:23.300
TEENY.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.734
THIS HAS DEFINITE
POSSIBILITIES.

02:26.734 --> 02:28.667
LET ME IN THERE.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.100
O.K., NEW PRINCIPAL IS...

02:31.100 --> 02:33.200
BEENY?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.000
DEENY?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.133
GEENY?

02:36.133 --> 02:37.700
LEENY?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.800
Both: HA!

02:41.800 --> 02:43.600
"NEW PRINCIPAL IS WEENY."

02:43.600 --> 02:47.367
CAN YOU IMAGINE
2,000 STUDENTS
READING THIS?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.200
POWER.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.500
ULTIMATE POWER.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.700
YEAH, BUT WE WOULD NEVER...

02:52.700 --> 02:54.100
WOULD WE?

02:54.100 --> 02:55.567
POWER.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.600
WE'D BE NOTORIOUS.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.700
WE WOULD BE
LEGENDS.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.600
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:00.600 --> 03:02.233
WHAT ARE WE NOW?

03:02.233 --> 03:04.867
WE ARE LOWLY SEVENTH GRADE
SEWER SCUM

03:04.867 --> 03:06.600
WHO NAME RATS
AFTER OURSELVES

03:06.600 --> 03:08.500
TO FEEL IMPORTANT.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.100
AND HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT THAT?

03:11.100 --> 03:13.867
BETTER THAN THE GUYS
WITH NO RATS.

03:13.867 --> 03:16.800
COR, WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
BE SOMETHING SPECIAL,

03:16.800 --> 03:19.100
OR WOULD YOU
RATHER BE US?

03:19.100 --> 03:21.567
SHAWN, POWER LIKE THAT
IN THE WRONG HANDS,

03:21.567 --> 03:24.000
IT'S DANGEROUS.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.400
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET'S GO.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.200
YEAH, WRONG HANDS,
WRONG HANDS.

03:40.133 --> 03:41.934
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.700
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.467
HIS NAME'S FEENY.

03:48.467 --> 03:50.500
THEY WROTE "WEENY."

03:50.500 --> 03:51.900
I'M LAUGHING.

03:51.900 --> 03:52.900
YOU LAUGHING?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.900
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF LAUGHING.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.100
I WOULD'VE BEEN
LAUGHING ALREADY,

03:56.100 --> 03:57.967
BUT I WAS TOO BUSY
LISTENING TO YOU, HARLEY.

03:57.967 --> 03:59.667
BUT I THINK I'M READY NOW.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.200
HA HA HA!

04:01.200 --> 04:04.033
A GUY WHO COULD COOK UP
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

04:04.033 --> 04:06.233
THAT'S A GUY I'D LIKE
TO HAVE HANGING WITH ME.

04:06.233 --> 04:09.000
HE'D BE A GREAT ADDITION
TO OUR ORGANIZATION.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.934
YEAH. HE COULD STAND
RIGHT HERE.

04:10.934 --> 04:13.600
I'M THINKING HE COULD STAND
RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.100
WELL, THEN WHERE
WOULD JOEY STAND?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.800
OH.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.400
AM I GOING FOR A RIDE?

04:24.300 --> 04:25.934
EXCUSE ME, HARLEY.

04:25.934 --> 04:28.967
SIR, ABOUT THAT GUY
YOU WANTED TO MEET--

04:28.967 --> 04:32.200
DID I SAY
YOU COULD EAVESDROP
ON A SENIOR CONVERSATION?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.233
DID YOUR LITTLE
SEVENTH GRADE EARS

04:34.233 --> 04:36.367
HEAR SOMETHING THEY
SHOULDN'T HAVE HEARD?

04:36.367 --> 04:38.400
FOR YOUR SAKE,
I TRULY HOPE NOT.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.400
HARLEY'S GOT
A WHOLE LOCKER
FULL OF EARS

04:40.400 --> 04:41.834
FROM GUYS WHO DONE
THE SAME THING.

04:41.834 --> 04:43.200
THEIR GLASSES
HANG CROOKED NOW

04:43.200 --> 04:46.033
'CAUSE THEY
GOT NO EARS.

04:46.033 --> 04:48.400
HOW MUCH TO KEEP
THE EARS?

04:48.400 --> 04:50.467
A BUCK.
THANK YOU.

04:52.300 --> 04:54.300
SHAWN, ARE YOU
FARTHER GONE

04:54.300 --> 04:56.400
THAN I EVER
WOULD'VE IMAGINED?

04:56.400 --> 04:58.233
NO, NO, I'M NOT GONE.

04:58.233 --> 04:59.400
I'VE ARRIVED.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.700
I AM KNOWN.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.467
I RULE THIS SCHOOL.

05:02.467 --> 05:04.834
MY FAME HERE
WILL LIVE FOREVER.

05:04.834 --> 05:07.500
EXCEPT NOBODY KNOWS
YOU DID THIS.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.200
YOU THINK
THAT BOTHERS ME?

05:10.200 --> 05:13.600
I KNOW I DID IT,
AND THAT'S GOOD
ENOUGH FOR ME.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.734
I WONDER WHO DID THIS.

05:15.734 --> 05:17.400
IF IT WAS MY BOYFRIEND,

05:17.400 --> 05:19.567
I WOULD DO ANYTHING
FOR HIM.

05:22.934 --> 05:26.100
OH, IT'S KILLING ME.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.500
O.K., <i>THE SCARLET LETTER. </i>

05:27.500 --> 05:30.200
HESTER PRYNNE HAS
A RED LETTER "A"
ON HER DRESS.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.600
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT
THE "A" STANDS FOR, RIGHT?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.100
BORING?

05:35.100 --> 05:37.400
EVERYBODY, DON'T
LAUGH AT MATTHEWS.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.834
HE'S NEVER SEEN
AN "A" BEFORE.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.567
OOH!
HA HA!

05:40.567 --> 05:42.800
THE BUZZ IS ALL OVER
THE MASSACHUSETTS COLONY

05:42.800 --> 05:45.867
THAT HESTER HAS TAKEN
THE PURE OUT OF PURITAN.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.400
IT'S SCANDAL.
IT'S GOSSIP.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.934
IT COULD'VE
COME RIGHT OUT OF
TODAY'S HEADLINES.

05:49.934 --> 05:51.800
HA HA!
HA HA!

05:51.800 --> 05:53.000
AHEM!

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
MR. FEENY, GOOD MORNING.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.300
ACTUALLY, MR. TURNER,
I'VE HAD BETTER.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.100
I HAVE BEEN FORCED
ON THIS PARTICULAR
MORNING

06:00.100 --> 06:01.900
TO GO FROM ROOM TO ROOM,

06:01.900 --> 06:03.300
ASKING ANYONE
WITH INFORMATION

06:03.300 --> 06:06.600
ABOUT THIS LITTLE
JOURNALISTIC PRANK

06:06.600 --> 06:08.300
TO COME FORWARD.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.033
HMM?

06:11.033 --> 06:13.900
I WILL GO A LOT EASIER
ON THE PERPETRATOR

06:13.900 --> 06:17.800
IF HE OR SHE OR THEY
VOLUNTARILY CONFESS.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.000
NO?

06:23.000 --> 06:24.100
VERY WELL.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.934
I WILL NOW RETURN YOU
TO YOUR LECTURE ON...

06:29.667 --> 06:31.600
ON THE LETTER "A."

06:33.600 --> 06:35.500
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.767
ERIC, MY SON,
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

06:47.767 --> 06:51.000
HO HO! WELL,
THAT'S PRETTY HYSTERICAL.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.200
YEAH, I LAUGHED
AT IT MYSELF.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.100
MY GIRLFRIEND, HOWEVER,
FAILED TO SEE THE HUMOR.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.300
SHE SAID, UH,

06:57.300 --> 06:59.467
HER "EFFORTS
AT JOURNALISTIC
EXCELLENCE

06:59.467 --> 07:00.600
"HAVE BEEN
FOREVER COMPROMISED

07:00.600 --> 07:03.500
"BY MY LIMITED INTELLECT
AND PROFOUND IMMATURITY."

07:03.500 --> 07:04.300
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.967
I SAID, "BITE ME."

07:07.900 --> 07:10.367
SO YOU'RE BACK ON THE MARKET.
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.100
I WAS DATING THE EDITOR
OF THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.800
IT WAS A STATUS
RELATIONSHIP.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.000
IT MADE ME
SOMEBODY SPECIAL.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I THINK YOU'RE
SOMEBODY SPECIAL.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.233
YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAD ME,
AND YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

07:20.233 --> 07:22.767
WELL, THAT'S TRUE,
BUT SOONER OR LATER

07:22.767 --> 07:24.400
LOVE WILL SOFTLY
SNEAK UP ON YOU

07:24.400 --> 07:28.400
AND WRAP YOU
IN ITS GENTLE EMBRACE--OW!

07:28.400 --> 07:30.600
YOU FORGOT
TO CLEAN OUT
THE GARAGE.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.900
AND IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

07:32.900 --> 07:35.834
LOOK. GEORGE IS
ON THE COVER...OH.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.233
"WEENY"!

07:37.233 --> 07:38.934
ISN'T THAT THE GREATEST
THING YOU EVER SAW?

07:38.934 --> 07:40.233
NO.

07:40.233 --> 07:41.300
SECOND GREATEST?

07:41.300 --> 07:43.400
IT SAYS WEENY.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.300
HOW COULD THIS
HAVE HAPPENED?

07:45.300 --> 07:47.600
I DON'T KNOW.
MOLLY PROOFREAD
THE WHOLE THING

07:47.600 --> 07:48.834
RIGHT BEFORE...

07:48.834 --> 07:49.834
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:49.834 --> 07:51.600
YOU'RE LYING.
YOU HAVE NO PROOF.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.400
YOU WERE THE LAST ONE
IN THE NEWSPAPER OFFICE

07:53.400 --> 07:54.967
BEFORE THE DISKS
WENT TO THE PRINTERS.

07:54.967 --> 07:57.300
CORY, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH THIS?

07:57.300 --> 07:59.767
NO. I DID NOT DO THIS,

07:59.767 --> 08:01.400
NOR DID I DO IT.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.600
WEENY. IT SAYS WEENY.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.233
I CAN READ!

08:12.834 --> 08:15.000
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THIS.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.867
WHAT IS THERE
NOT TO UNDER--

08:16.867 --> 08:18.400
MOLLY, HI.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.667
GET OUT OF MY SIGHT,
YOU VERMICULAR MISCREANT.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.600
SO, HOW'S IT GOING
WITH MOLLY?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.600
THERE'S NO
TALKING TO HER.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.100
SHE'S A VICIOUS,
HUMORLESS MAN-KILLER

08:30.100 --> 08:31.667
WHO LEAVES NOTHING
BUT A TRAIL OF MISERY

08:31.667 --> 08:33.567
AND CRUSHED HEARTS
IN HER WAKE.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.734
SO IT'S O.K.
IF I CALL HER?

08:35.734 --> 08:39.667
I AM THROUGH WITH WOMEN
FOR MY JUNIOR YEAR.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.200
THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME
ABOUT TO FALL IN LOVE

08:42.200 --> 08:44.033
WITH SOME BEAUTIFUL,
HEARTLESS BAG OF MISERY,

08:44.033 --> 08:45.200
I WANT YOU
TO TALK ME DOWN.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.500
YOU GOT IT,
AND CAN I CALL HER?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
OH!

08:50.400 --> 08:51.467
OH!

08:51.467 --> 08:52.467
MY SHOES!

08:52.467 --> 08:53.500
YOUR SHOES?
MY SHOES!

08:53.500 --> 08:54.767
I JUST BOUGHT MINE.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.400
I JUST BOUGHT MINE
IN NEW YORK.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.467
OH, MY PANTS!

08:58.467 --> 09:00.467
MY BLOUSE!
MY HAIR.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.934
MY, MY.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.500
MY, OH, MY.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.300
UH...BAG OF MISERY.
BAG OF MISERY.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.700
BAG OF...MISERY.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.033
YEAH. I KNOW.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:12.033 --> 09:13.967
I'M SORRY I BUMPED
INTO YOU.

09:13.967 --> 09:15.133
I'LL JUST GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

09:15.133 --> 09:16.967
WELL, THAT'S A SHAME

09:16.967 --> 09:19.700
BECAUSE MY FAMILY
JUST MOVED HERE
FROM ATLANTA,

09:19.700 --> 09:22.967
AND IT'S MY SENIOR YEAR
IN A BRAND-NEW SCHOOL,

09:22.967 --> 09:25.800
AND I'M JUST SO UTTERLY,
UTTERLY LOST.

09:25.800 --> 09:26.934
YOU'RE A SENIOR?

09:26.934 --> 09:27.934
MISERY BAG.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.000
SENIOR.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.667
OLD MISERY BAG.

09:31.667 --> 09:32.934
I KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.100
ARE YOU DOING ANYTHING
RIGHT NOW?
NO.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.500
THEN YOU'RE GONNA WANT
TO GET THESE.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.967
DESIREE EMMALINE
HOLLINGER BEAUMONT.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.667
BUT YOU MAY CALL ME
DESIREE.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.834
ERIC MATTHEWS.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.934
YOU MAY CALL ME
DESIREE.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.967
O.K. A RUMOR WAS
GOING AROUND SCHOOL

09:59.967 --> 10:02.367
THAT THE "WEENY"
HEADLINE WAS JUST
A TYPO.

10:02.367 --> 10:05.600
THAT NOBODY DID IT,
LIKE I DON'T EXIST.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.934
CHECK IT OUT.

10:06.934 --> 10:08.133
NOW I EXIST.

10:08.133 --> 10:09.400
I AM SOMEBODY!

10:11.033 --> 10:12.767
[GASP]

10:12.767 --> 10:14.767
A THING OF BEAUTY, EH?

10:14.767 --> 10:17.000
[GASP]

10:17.000 --> 10:19.500
I SNUCK IN EARLY THIS
MORNING AND CHANGED IT.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.734
LOOKS LIKE
THE REAL THING,
DOESN'T IT?

10:21.734 --> 10:23.567
EXCEPT FOR
THIS DRIP.

10:23.567 --> 10:26.133
SHAWN, YOU'RE OUT
OF CONTROL.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.233
YEAH, I AM.
TELL YOUR FRIENDS.

10:29.967 --> 10:32.467
THERE'S YOUR MAN,
MR. WEENY.

10:35.767 --> 10:38.600
MR. FEENY, I DID NOT
PAINT THIS "W."

10:38.600 --> 10:40.467
AND THE HEADLINE
IN THE SCHOOL NEWSPAPER?

10:40.467 --> 10:41.600
IT WASN'T ME.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.367
MR. MATTHEWS, OUR OWN
ESTEEMED JANITOR BUD

10:44.367 --> 10:46.934
PLACED YOU AT THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME.

10:46.934 --> 10:49.300
I SEEN HIM WITH
MY GOOD EYE.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.033
THAT'LL BE ALL,
JANITOR BUD.

10:52.033 --> 10:53.467
AYE-AYE, SIR.

10:53.467 --> 10:56.300
OUT OF MY WAY,
YOU LITTLE PUKE MACHINES!

10:57.800 --> 10:59.934
SCENE OF THE CRIME?

10:59.934 --> 11:02.500
JANITOR BUD SAID
HE SAW YOU AND ANOTHER BOY

11:02.500 --> 11:05.100
TOYING WITH THE COMPUTER
AFTER SCHOOL.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.867
UNFORTUNATELY, HE
DIDN'T GET A GOOD LOOK
AT YOUR ACCOMPLICE.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.100
MR. FEENY,
I'M TOTALLY INNOCENT.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.667
MY HANDS ARE CLEAN.

11:12.667 --> 11:15.500
[GASP]

11:15.500 --> 11:17.400
I DIDN'T DO IT.
I SWEAR.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.100
ALL RIGHT, THEN
GIVE ME THE NAME
OF THE PERSON WHO DID.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.200
I SEE.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.100
MR. MATTHEWS, YOU HAVE
UNTIL THE END
OF SCHOOL TOMORROW

11:26.100 --> 11:28.500
TO GIVE ME
THE PERPETRATOR'S NAME.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.300
OTHERWISE,
YOU WILL BE SUSPENDED.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.800
HEY!
HOW YOU BOTH DOING?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.200
BETTER THAN YOU.
MR. FEENY CALLED.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.500
HE TOLD US HE'S
MEETING WITH YOU
IN HIS OFFICE TOMORROW.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.033
HE ALSO SAID TO ASK
YOU WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.767
O.K., LOOK.

11:52.767 --> 11:54.600
I'M IN THIS SORT
OF A SITUATION,

11:54.600 --> 11:56.500
AND I DON'T EXACTLY
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.667
WELL, IF YOU WANT TO,
YOU COULD TALK TO US.

11:58.667 --> 11:59.934
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA
MAKE YOU.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.700
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT THIS FRIEND

12:03.700 --> 12:05.600
WHO'S PULLED A MAJOR SCAM
AT SCHOOL.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.967
SHAWN.
NOT SHAWN.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.300
SHAWN.
FINE, MOM.
THINK IT'S SHAWN.

12:09.300 --> 12:13.233
BECAUSE THAT PROTECTS
THE KID IT REALLY IS.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.033
ANYWAY, THIS KID
DID SOMETHING.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.400
WITH THE
NEWSPAPER HEADLINE.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.300
YEAH. IT COULD BE.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.100
NOW, MR. FEENY KNOWS
I DIDN'T DO IT,

12:21.100 --> 12:23.700
BUT HE ALSO THINKS HE
KNOWS I KNOW WHO DID.

12:23.700 --> 12:24.967
SHAWN.
NOT SHAWN.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.200
SHAWN!

12:26.200 --> 12:28.734
AMY, HE SAYS IT'S
NOT SHAWN, I BELIEVE HIM.

12:28.734 --> 12:30.967
OBVIOUSLY IT'S SHAWN!

12:30.967 --> 12:34.667
I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS.
A FRIEND DOES NOT
RAT OUT A FRIEND.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.834
WHAT ARE YOU,
IN A PRISON MOVIE?

12:36.834 --> 12:38.400
THERE ARE
CONSEQUENCES.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.967
WHAT'S THE WORST THAT
FEENY CAN DO?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.233
WELL, HE'S THREATENING
TO SUSPEND ME.

12:42.233 --> 12:44.600
GREAT. A BIG RED
"S" ON HIS
PERMANENT RECORD.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.767
OH, WHO LOOKS AT THAT?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.734
SOME COLLEGES
HE APPLIES TO.

12:48.734 --> 12:51.100
ANY COLLEGE WILL LET YOU IN
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.667
DO WE HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY?

12:52.667 --> 12:54.600
NO.

12:54.600 --> 12:59.300
YOU HAVE TO RAT
OUT YOUR FRIEND
'CAUSE WE'RE POOR.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.734
WHAT POSSESSED
SHAWN TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

13:02.734 --> 13:03.767
I DON'T KNOW.

13:03.767 --> 13:06.100
HE JUST WANTED
TO BE SOMEONE SPECIAL,

13:06.100 --> 13:08.400
NOT SOME
SEVENTH GRADE NOTHING.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.100
MAYBE WHEN YOU GET A
LITTLE OLDER AND MORE MATURE,

13:11.100 --> 13:15.300
YOU'LL REALIZE THAT
STUNTS AND GIMMICKS ARE
NOT WHAT MAKE YOU SPECIAL.

13:15.300 --> 13:18.100
I'M DATING A SENIOR.
I'M SPECIAL!

13:18.100 --> 13:19.500
I AM FABULOUS.

13:19.500 --> 13:23.100
I HAVE A TREMENDOUS
NEWFOUND SENSE
OF SELF-WORTH.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.300
NOTHING BAD
CAN HAPPEN, RIGHT?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.300
NO.
NO.
NO.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.367
GOOD.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.033
MR. MATTHEWS,
I TRUST

13:39.033 --> 13:40.834
YOU'RE NOT FORGETTING
OUR 3:30 MEETING.

13:40.834 --> 13:44.900
COME ON, MR. FEENY.
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE PRANK.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.300
DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE MAYBE

13:46.300 --> 13:47.834
TAKING IT TOO SERIOUSLY?

13:47.834 --> 13:50.300
AH, YOU THINK
I'M ACTING

13:50.300 --> 13:52.500
LIKE A WEENIE,
MR. MATTHEWS.

13:52.500 --> 13:53.967
AM I ACTING
LIKE A WEENIE?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.000
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.834
BUT I KNOW
YOU KNOW WHO DID.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.467
AND UNTIL YOU TELL
ME WHO IT IS,

13:59.467 --> 14:02.233
THE ONLY PERSON I
CAN TALK TO IS YOU.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.300
3:30, MR. MATTHEWS.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.100
3:30, MR. FEENY.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.800
DID YOU TELL HIM?

14:10.800 --> 14:12.600
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:12.600 --> 14:15.033
THANKS, MAN.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.000
YOU'RE WELCOME.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.133
'CAUSE IT WAS JUST
A LITTLE PRANK,

14:19.133 --> 14:22.133
AND NOTHING ELSE
IS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN
AGAIN, RIGHT?

14:22.133 --> 14:24.467
RIGHT. IT'S NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

14:24.467 --> 14:25.867
SO, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

14:28.133 --> 14:31.900

15:00.400 --> 15:01.567
YOU DIDN'T?

15:01.567 --> 15:03.300
NO. SOMEBODY
RIPPED MY IDEA.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.367
I'LL NEVER BE
A LEGEND NOW.

15:05.367 --> 15:06.400
I'M LAUGHING.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.400
I'M HYSTERICAL.

KIND OF FLAIR.

YOU HEAR THAT, FRANKIE?

15:19.367 --> 15:21.200

15:21.200 --> 15:23.400

WAS GONNA BE

STANDING HERE,

THE MOTIVATION WE NEEDED.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.700
WE DID IT FOR YOU.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.200

15:40.700 --> 15:43.233

15:43.233 --> 15:45.800
YO, KID,
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY!

15:47.200 --> 15:48.367
NOW AFTER SCHOOL,

15:48.367 --> 15:50.767
YOU CAN DRIVE ME
TO THE MALL

15:50.767 --> 15:53.300
BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE ANYTHING IS YET.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.367
AND WHILE I'M INVESTIGATING
THE FINEST STORES,

15:56.367 --> 16:01.033
YOU CAN TAKE MY NEW KITTEN
THAT DADDY BOUGHT ME AND
HAVE HIM NEUTERED.

16:01.033 --> 16:03.300
WHO'S YOUR LITTLE
GEORGIA PEACH?

16:03.300 --> 16:05.600
YOU ARE.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.600

YANKEE DOODLE?

16:07.600 --> 16:09.400

16:15.000 --> 16:17.033
SHE'S A SENIOR.

16:17.033 --> 16:19.400
IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE GETTING NEUTERED?

16:19.400 --> 16:22.767
THE CAT'S
GETTING NEUTERED.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.033
MAYBE YOU CAN GET
A 2-FOR-1 DEAL.

16:25.033 --> 16:26.367
OR AM I TOO LATE?

16:26.367 --> 16:28.934
HEY, THIS HAPPENS
TO BE A RELATIONSHIP

16:28.934 --> 16:30.700
BETWEEN TWO
COMPLETE EQUALS.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.300
YOU KNOW, MY LITTLE
PUFF PASTRY,

16:33.300 --> 16:35.600
THERE'S A LICK
OF WINTER IN THE AIR.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.600
WOULD YOU MIND,
BEFORE PICKING ME UP,

16:37.600 --> 16:39.667
DRIVING AROUND THE BLOCK
FOR 40 MINUTES

16:39.667 --> 16:43.200
WHILE THE HEATER'S ON SO
THE INSIDE OF THE CAR
IS ALL NICE AND TOASTY?

16:43.200 --> 16:46.400
WOULD YA
DO THAT FOR ME?

16:46.400 --> 16:49.000
SAY,
"YES, PUDDIN'."

16:50.767 --> 16:51.800
YES.

16:54.467 --> 16:57.300
I BELIEVE
THE WOMAN WANTS PUDDIN'.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.400
PUDDIN'.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.400
YOU KNOW, I HOPE THAT
WHEN I GET A GIRLFRIEND,

17:07.400 --> 17:10.500
SHE RESPECTS ME
THE EXACT SAME WAY
SHE RESPECTS YOU.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.967
AND IF I DO,

17:11.967 --> 17:13.800
I WANT YOU TO...

17:13.800 --> 17:16.900
"DRIVE YOUR CAR AROUND
THE BLOCK FOR 40 MINUTES

17:16.900 --> 17:21.033
TILL THE HEATER GETS ALL
NICE AND TOASTY!"

17:21.033 --> 17:24.900
THEN I WANT YOU
TO RUN ME OVER.

17:24.900 --> 17:28.700
WOULD YA DO THAT
FOR ME, PUDDIN'?

17:28.700 --> 17:32.467
SO, YOU GONNA BE
SHOOTING SOME HOOPS
TODAY AFTER SCHOOL?

17:32.467 --> 17:33.867
I CAN'T.
I GOT THIS

17:33.867 --> 17:35.567
LITTLE MEETING
WITH MR. FEENY

17:35.567 --> 17:37.200
WHERE HE'S GOING TO
ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS

17:37.200 --> 17:38.800
ABOUT SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.100
AND IF I DON'T
TELL HIM WHO DID,

17:41.100 --> 17:42.934
I GET SUSPENDED.

17:42.934 --> 17:45.934
AND I TOTALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR DOING THIS FOR ME.

17:45.934 --> 17:48.500
AFTER I BLEW UP
THAT MAILBOX LAST YEAR,

17:48.500 --> 17:50.033
DAD SAID
ONE MORE SCREW-UP,

17:50.033 --> 17:51.967
AND HE'D SHIP ME OFF
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

17:51.967 --> 17:55.300
YOU KNOW, I CAN ONLY
COVER FOR YOU FOR SO LONG.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.300
HOW LONG?

17:58.767 --> 18:01.500
"WEENY WEENY
WEENY WEENY

18:01.500 --> 18:03.667
WEENY WEENY..."

18:05.934 --> 18:08.300
AND "WEENY."

18:08.300 --> 18:11.100
DON'T BE LATE,
MR. MATTHEWS.

18:12.400 --> 18:16.400
GO EASY ON HIM, GEORGE.
HE'S AT A NEW SCHOOL.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.500
AS AM I,
MR. TURNER.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.300
AS AM I.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.300
IN THE END,
HESTER PRYNNE
IS FACED WITH

18:27.300 --> 18:28.600
A PRETTY TOUGH DECISION.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.967
DOES SHE RAT
ON THE PERSON

18:29.967 --> 18:31.500
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER PREDICAMENT,

18:31.500 --> 18:32.867
OR DOES SHE KEEP
HIS SECRET

18:32.867 --> 18:34.400
AND FACE THE SCORN
OF SOCIETY?

18:34.400 --> 18:36.900
PRETTY RELEVANT STUFF,
EH, MATTHEWS? HUNTER?

18:36.900 --> 18:39.700
SIR! IT STOOD
FOR ADULTERY, SIR!

18:42.033 --> 18:45.667
I WAS PRACTICING
FOR MILITARY SCHOOL.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.967
[BELL RINGS]

18:47.967 --> 18:50.400
MATTHEWS, HANG
FOR A MINUTE, WILL YOU?

18:50.400 --> 18:53.700
I CAN'T, SIR.
I'VE GOT A DATE
WITH DESTINY.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.967
YOU CAN BE A COUPLE
OF MINUTES LATE.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.000
WHAT'S FEENY GONNA DO,
SUSPEND YOU?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.367
HE'S GOING SO PSYCHO
OVER THIS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:00.367 --> 19:03.900
I THINK WHEN YOU'RE
NEW AT A SCHOOL,
LIKE YOU AND ME,

19:03.900 --> 19:07.367
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
REALLY STICK.
THEY DECIDE YOUR REPUTATION.

19:07.367 --> 19:08.934
WHAT IF TOMORROW
YOU RAISED YOUR HAND

19:08.934 --> 19:11.200
AND I SAID,
"WHAT DO YOU WANT,
BOOGER?"

19:11.200 --> 19:12.900
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

19:12.900 --> 19:14.967
IT WOULD PROBABLY FOLLOW YOU
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL.

19:14.967 --> 19:17.500
MAYBE ALL YOUR LIFE PEOPLE
WOULD CALL YOU BOOGER.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.867
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

19:18.867 --> 19:20.600
I'M THE TEACHER.
I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.233
I WIELD THE POWER
TO INFORM AND TO INFLUENCE.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.734
SO DO PEOPLE
WHO MAKE FUNNY
NEWSPAPER HEADLINES

19:25.734 --> 19:27.867
ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL,
WHO'S NEW IN SCHOOL,

19:27.867 --> 19:30.100
LIKE YOU AND ME.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.800
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD SQUEAL
ON MY FRIEND?

19:32.800 --> 19:33.900
NO, I'M NOT.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.867
SO I SHOULD
COVER FOR HIM?

19:35.867 --> 19:37.200
I'M NOT SAYING
THAT, EITHER.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.400
SO, WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING?

19:39.400 --> 19:41.200
I WAS HOPING
YOU'D KNOW.

19:45.700 --> 19:48.133
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
GOING TO CALL ME
BOOGER, ARE YOU?

19:48.133 --> 19:49.867
I'LL SEE HOW I FEEL.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.734
LISTEN...ABOUT
THE HEADLINE AND ALL...

20:01.734 --> 20:05.300
WELL, I'M SORRY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.567
IT MUST HAVE HURT
BEING CALLED...

20:08.567 --> 20:09.734
YOU KNOW.

20:09.734 --> 20:11.467
OH, AS IF I'D NEVER
HEARD IT BEFORE.

20:11.467 --> 20:14.200
IT WAS PRACTICALLY
MY NICKNAME GROWING UP.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.600
UH, THAT'S NOT
TO LEAVE THIS ROOM.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.400
I GUESS IT'S
MORE OF A BIG DEAL
THAN I THOUGHT.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.667
AS PRINCIPAL
OF THIS HIGH SCHOOL,

20:22.667 --> 20:24.200
I'M EXPECTED
TO KEEP ORDER.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.367
UNCHECKED, THESE PRANKS
UNDERMINE MY AUTHORITY

20:27.367 --> 20:29.567
AND BREED DISRESPECT.

20:29.567 --> 20:33.033
SO I GUESS I GET
PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING
I DIDN'T DO.

20:33.033 --> 20:34.667
NAME THE PERSON WHO DID,

20:34.667 --> 20:36.033
AND YOU WALK OUT
OF HERE SCOT-FREE.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.967
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

20:39.967 --> 20:44.133
YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS,
AND THAT'S YOUR FINAL
DECISION?

20:44.133 --> 20:45.900
YEAH.

20:45.900 --> 20:47.600
YOU'VE DECIDED THAT
PROTECTING A FRIENDSHIP

20:47.600 --> 20:48.734
IS MORE IMPORTANT

20:48.734 --> 20:52.233
THAN THE GRISLY PUNISHMENT
I SHALL NOW DISPENSE?

20:52.233 --> 20:54.300
MR. FEENY, HE DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.200
HE JUST WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING

20:57.200 --> 20:59.300
THAT WOULD MAKE
HIM SOMEBODY
SPECIAL.

20:59.300 --> 21:03.000
AH...TO BE SOMEBODY
SPECIAL

21:03.000 --> 21:06.033
IS A QUALITY FROM WITHIN,
MR. MATTHEWS.

21:06.033 --> 21:08.000
TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.567
I THINK IT'S
A VERY RARE QUALITY

21:10.567 --> 21:14.000
FOR YOU TO PUT
A FRIEND'S WELFARE
BEFORE YOUR OWN.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.300
BUT JUST A SECOND AGO,

21:17.300 --> 21:18.767
YOU WANTED ME
TO RAT ON HIM.

21:18.767 --> 21:20.467
AS THE NEW
PRINCIPAL, YES,

21:20.467 --> 21:21.734
BUT AS YOUR TEACHER,

21:21.734 --> 21:24.400
AS SOMEONE WHO LIVED
NEXT DOOR

21:24.400 --> 21:26.133
AND WATCHED YOU GROW UP,

21:26.133 --> 21:29.300
I NEVER EXPECTED IT
FOR A MOMENT.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.400
SO, HOW LONG AM I
SUSPENDED FOR?

21:44.400 --> 21:45.500
YOU'RE NOT.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.400
DETENTION FOR FIVE DAYS--

21:47.400 --> 21:50.967
ONE DAY
FOR EACH LETTER IN WEENY,
WHICH IN THIS INSTANCE,

21:50.967 --> 21:56.667
SHOULD PROPERLY BE SPELLED
W-E-E-N-I-E,

21:56.667 --> 22:00.834
SHOULDN'T IT, MR. HUNTER?

22:00.834 --> 22:02.100
YOU TOLD HIM?

22:02.100 --> 22:04.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.500
I THINK YOU WOULDN'T.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.600
I'M AN IDIOT.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.600
HE REFUSED TO RAT YOU OUT,
MR. HUNTER,

22:11.600 --> 22:15.000
AND HE NOW FACES
A WEEK OF DETENTION
IN YOUR HONOR,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.300
BUT THE PUNISHMENT
FOR NOT BEING CAUGHT,
MR. HUNTER,

22:18.300 --> 22:20.600
IS FAR, FAR WORSE.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.967
I DID IT, MR. FEENY!

22:23.967 --> 22:25.300
I CONFESS.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.600
I WILL BE WATCHING YOU
EVERY MOMENT

22:27.600 --> 22:29.500
OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL CAREER,

22:29.500 --> 22:31.500
WHICH IN YOUR CASE
COULD BE DECADES.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.300
BUT I JUST CONFESSED.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.000
TOO LATE, MR. HUNTER!

22:35.000 --> 22:38.200
YOU ARE MY NEW
SPECIAL FRIEND.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.000
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TURN ME IN?
