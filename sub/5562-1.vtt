WEBVTT

00:04.005 --> 00:05.204
Aah!

00:05.206 --> 00:06.071
Leave me.

00:06.073 --> 00:07.539
I can stall them.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.040
Give you some time.

00:09.042 --> 00:10.641
Go.

00:10.643 --> 00:12.109
We're not gonna
just leave him here.

00:12.111 --> 00:15.145
Arkady has many friends here.

00:15.147 --> 00:16.579
Agent Sabatino, CIA,

00:16.581 --> 00:19.048
<i> Special Activities Division.</i>

00:19.050 --> 00:20.749
Yo, uh, Kirkin?

00:20.751 --> 00:22.451
What do you want?

00:22.452 --> 00:24.152
This is gonna sound funny,
but we actually want

00:24.154 --> 00:25.086
to kill you.

00:25.088 --> 00:26.587
The LAPD

00:26.589 --> 00:28.221
has decided to open

00:28.223 --> 00:29.488
an investigation

00:29.490 --> 00:31.056
into you.

00:42.068 --> 00:43.400
(indistinct chatter,
dog barking)

00:43.402 --> 00:46.202
(train whistle blows)

00:58.081 --> 00:59.313
I did my best.

00:59.315 --> 01:01.448
This is all I got.

01:37.685 --> 01:40.218
Don't even think about it.

01:44.123 --> 01:46.690
What are you doing here?

02:21.392 --> 02:23.525
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:26.196 --> 02:28.663
This guy had no I.D., no keys.

02:28.665 --> 02:30.631
Prints didn't turn up anywhere.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.399
You sure you don't know
who he is?

02:34.269 --> 02:36.335
Then why was he
following you?

02:36.337 --> 02:38.904
Maybe he was following you.

02:38.906 --> 02:40.205
He wasn't following me.

02:40.207 --> 02:41.506
He was following you.

02:41.508 --> 02:43.441
I know, because I was
following both of you.

02:43.443 --> 02:44.809
And why was that?

02:44.811 --> 02:48.212
Stopped by your place for a beer
after my workout

02:48.214 --> 02:50.547
just in time to see you, uh,

02:50.549 --> 02:53.750
leaving, looking like Deeks
on a bad day.

02:53.752 --> 02:55.918
I figured you were
up to something.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.452
May need backup.

02:57.454 --> 02:59.687
Never crossed your mind
you could just call me?

02:59.689 --> 03:03.190
If you wanted my help,
you would have asked.

03:03.192 --> 03:04.925
(chuckles)
And yet here you are.

03:04.927 --> 03:06.259
Just 'cause you
didn't want my help

03:06.261 --> 03:09.595
doesn't mean you didn't need it.

03:09.597 --> 03:11.697
Turns out I was right.

03:11.699 --> 03:13.932
What the hell's
going on?

03:13.934 --> 03:16.734
Following up a lead.

03:16.736 --> 03:19.236
And?

03:19.238 --> 03:21.805
It's too early to tell.

03:21.807 --> 03:24.274
Okay, cool.

03:24.276 --> 03:26.643
You don't want to tell me.

03:26.645 --> 03:29.545
Hetty's gonna want some answers.

03:30.581 --> 03:33.515
I'll see you at work.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.517
Ah, mm-hmm.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.652
You're welcome
for saving your life.

03:42.658 --> 03:45.225
DEEKS: How long we going?
It's hot out here.

03:45.227 --> 03:46.326
No, no. Not "we."

03:46.328 --> 03:47.393
I'm jogging.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.694
You're on a bike.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.295
It's not a bicycle, baby,
it's a chopper.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.596
(bell imitates engine revving)

03:51.598 --> 03:54.732
Oh, my God!
You are so ridiculous!

03:54.734 --> 03:55.833
Hi, Marty.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.234
Hey, hi.

03:57.236 --> 03:58.235
Who's that?

03:58.237 --> 03:59.403
I have no idea.

03:59.404 --> 04:00.570
Oh, really?
Then why did she know your name?

04:00.572 --> 04:03.272
I don't know.
Maybe she's a cop.

04:03.274 --> 04:05.774
Oh, LAPD Bimbo Squad!

04:05.776 --> 04:08.276
You obviously have
low blood sugar.

04:08.278 --> 04:10.344
Maybe we should stop and
get you some waffles.

04:10.346 --> 04:11.378
No, no, no.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.346
I have six more miles to go.

04:13.348 --> 04:14.581
What, are you kidding me?

04:14.582 --> 04:15.815
Six<i> more</i> miles?!
I told you not to come.

04:15.817 --> 04:17.283
Morning, Marty.

04:17.285 --> 04:18.917
Hey, hi.
How are you?

04:18.919 --> 04:20.919
I think that's
the-the barista

04:20.921 --> 04:23.321
that works at the coffee
shop next to the boatshed?

04:23.323 --> 04:24.422
That's probably how
she knows my name.

04:24.424 --> 04:25.689
She writes it
on my latte.

04:25.691 --> 04:26.856
Did you recognize her?
No.

04:26.858 --> 04:28.457
Yeah, I think her
name is Cheryl.

04:28.459 --> 04:29.858
That's how she knows me.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.260
Listen, seriously, though?
I'm getting light-headed.

04:32.262 --> 04:33.912
Maybe we should stop, go
back to that restaurant,

04:33.913 --> 04:35.563
Oh, my gosh.
They had a
breakfast pasta...

04:35.565 --> 04:37.298
You have to...
Listen to this.
Breakfast pasta

04:37.300 --> 04:38.365
that had both
sausage and bacon.

04:38.367 --> 04:39.366
You have to stop
talking about food.

04:39.368 --> 04:40.400
Why, 'cause you're hungry?

04:40.402 --> 04:41.868
Maybe.
'Cause I'm hungry, too.

04:41.870 --> 04:43.603
You want to know why?
'Cause it's breakfast time.

04:43.604 --> 04:45.337
And breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.539
It's scientifically proven.

04:46.540 --> 04:47.739
It was written in the Bible,
it said,

04:47.742 --> 04:49.308
"Thou shall eat breakfast."
WOMAN (whistles): Marty!

04:49.310 --> 04:50.809
Hey! Party Marty!

04:50.811 --> 04:52.343
Hey, girls!
Part-Party Marty.

04:52.345 --> 04:54.645
That's a tough one.

04:54.647 --> 04:57.414
Listen, so, long
before I met you,

04:57.416 --> 04:58.448
Mm-hmm.
There...
Doesn't matter.

04:58.450 --> 04:59.482
I love you.

04:59.484 --> 05:00.649
I love you, too.

05:00.651 --> 05:01.616
All right.

05:01.618 --> 05:03.317
Party Marty.

05:03.319 --> 05:05.319
No... Oh, God!
No! Sweet...

05:05.321 --> 05:07.020
See, you know what that is?

05:07.022 --> 05:10.590
That's hunger-induced road rage!

05:10.592 --> 05:12.925
(whoops)

05:12.927 --> 05:15.727
Any luck on the body?

05:15.729 --> 05:16.828
Not yet.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.396
What about the vehicle
Callen met?

05:18.398 --> 05:20.664
No, but we're
widening our search.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.732
Well, the guy I shot
wasn't a vagrant.

05:22.734 --> 05:24.500
So he wasn't from the area.

05:24.502 --> 05:26.435
He must've drove there.

05:26.437 --> 05:28.303
Then continued
following Callen on foot

05:28.305 --> 05:30.471
just like I did,
so search for any

05:30.473 --> 05:32.873
abandoned, impounded
or ticketed cars nearby.

05:32.875 --> 05:33.940
You got it.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.308
Where are the others?

05:35.310 --> 05:37.310
Uh, Kensi and Deeks
are on their way in.

05:37.312 --> 05:38.411
What about Callen?

05:38.413 --> 05:40.012
Hasn't shown up yet.

06:13.846 --> 06:15.978
What are you doing here?

06:19.450 --> 06:22.384
I could ask you
the same question.

06:22.386 --> 06:24.452
I live here.

06:26.422 --> 06:29.356
Do you need something?

06:29.358 --> 06:31.891
An explanation
would be nice.

06:31.893 --> 06:34.460
I'm still working on that.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.728
Work faster.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.865
You suddenly don't trust me?

06:40.867 --> 06:43.534
It's not a question of trust.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.969
It's, um, I-I don't enjoy

06:45.971 --> 06:47.971
being in the dark.

06:47.973 --> 06:50.373
But you have no trouble keeping
the rest of us there?

06:50.375 --> 06:52.808
Tread carefully, Mr. Callen.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.609
Always.

06:54.611 --> 06:58.379
You know, I need you to report
to work immediately.

06:58.381 --> 07:00.080
I'm taking some more

07:00.082 --> 07:01.781
vacation time.

07:01.783 --> 07:03.415
I can't approve that.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.482
Then consider it
sick leave.

07:08.453 --> 07:10.553
This conversation

07:10.555 --> 07:12.788
is not over, Mr. Callen.

07:12.790 --> 07:14.856
(door closes)

07:37.713 --> 07:39.412
You wanted to see me?

07:41.015 --> 07:42.514
Yeah.

07:42.516 --> 07:44.382
I want to know what's
going on with your partner.

07:44.384 --> 07:46.517
I can't tell you.
Why not?

07:46.519 --> 07:48.151
'Cause he's my partner,
not my wife.

07:48.153 --> 07:49.986
Okay, best guess.

07:49.988 --> 07:52.521
I guess he doesn't think
it's worth bothering us with.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.689
Even though we've got
an unidentified dead body?

07:54.691 --> 07:56.157
It was self-defense.

07:56.159 --> 07:57.158
I certainly hope so.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.459
We all have things

07:58.461 --> 07:59.726
that we work on on our own

07:59.728 --> 08:01.394
until we think it's worth

08:01.396 --> 08:02.628
getting the
others involved.

08:02.630 --> 08:03.996
He'll tell us
when he's ready.

08:03.998 --> 08:05.497
Well, I'm ready now.

08:05.499 --> 08:06.631
So figure it out.

08:06.633 --> 08:07.865
Don't worry about Callen.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.166
I'm not.

08:09.168 --> 08:10.467
Do I look worried?

08:10.469 --> 08:12.569
No.

08:12.571 --> 08:14.904
You look annoyed.

08:14.906 --> 08:16.705
Like always.

08:16.707 --> 08:19.140
Well, if you keep it up,

08:19.142 --> 08:22.943
you're gonna get to see
what I look like when I'm angry.

08:24.146 --> 08:26.779
Nice shot.

08:28.582 --> 08:30.481
What are you doing?

08:30.483 --> 08:32.082
Oh.

08:32.084 --> 08:34.417
Please don't tell me
that was loaded.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.885
Of course not.

08:35.887 --> 08:38.587
It's, uh, gun safety 101.

08:38.589 --> 08:40.655
"Gun safety"?
Yeah.

08:40.657 --> 08:42.089
Uh, Hetty said I could start
training with a weapon.

08:42.091 --> 08:43.857
What would you recommend for me?

08:43.859 --> 08:45.792
(chuckles)
A NERF gun.

08:48.763 --> 08:51.096
Okay, you want to learn
to use a weapon?

08:51.098 --> 08:52.197
I'll train you.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.932
But you do what I say

08:53.934 --> 08:55.767
when I say it, all right?

08:55.769 --> 08:58.202
All right, copy that.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.070
All right, now the first
thing I need you to do

09:00.072 --> 09:01.805
is keep tabs on Callen for me.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.173
Callen?

09:03.175 --> 09:06.676
Phone, credit card,
passports, everything.

09:06.678 --> 09:07.777
Callen Callen?

09:07.779 --> 09:09.295
What are you-- a parrot?

09:09.296 --> 09:10.812
You want me to spy
on your partner?

09:10.815 --> 09:12.080
I didn't say anything
about spying.

09:12.082 --> 09:13.781
I want you to keep<i> tabs</i> on him.

09:13.783 --> 09:15.949
Without his knowledge.

09:15.951 --> 09:19.218
Does this have, um,
Hetty's seal of approval?

09:20.788 --> 09:21.920
Yeah.

09:21.922 --> 09:23.554
And I don't suppose
it would matter

09:23.556 --> 09:25.789
if I felt uncomfortable
doing this?

09:25.791 --> 09:28.758
Send me anything and
everything to my phone.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.192
And put these away
before you hurt yourself.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.860
As a... you know what?
I'll put these away.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.062
Find Callen.

09:34.064 --> 09:35.763
(clears his throat)

09:35.765 --> 09:38.799
Hey, Sam?

09:38.801 --> 09:40.867
What about fighting?

09:40.869 --> 09:41.834
What?

09:41.836 --> 09:44.203
Will you teach me to fight, too?

09:44.205 --> 09:47.706
One thing at a time,
grasshopper.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.974
Find Callen.

09:49.976 --> 09:51.875
Yes, Master Hanna.

09:51.877 --> 09:53.509
Don't ever call me that.

09:53.511 --> 09:54.943
It didn't feel right.

09:54.945 --> 09:57.812
Okay?

09:57.814 --> 09:59.013
No, I understand protocol,
Sergeant.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.614
I'm just saying
if anything comes up,

10:00.616 --> 10:01.681
you could just pass it along.

10:01.683 --> 10:02.782
Yep, Mm-hmm.

10:02.784 --> 10:03.983
You're incredibly helpful.

10:03.985 --> 10:05.150
Okay, see you later.

10:05.152 --> 10:06.751
Don't miss him.

10:06.753 --> 10:08.369
Let me guess--
our boy doesn't match

10:08.370 --> 10:09.986
any missing persons
and it hasn't been 24 hours,

10:09.989 --> 10:11.521
so blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.589
Wow, that's actually
a direct quote.

10:13.591 --> 10:15.857
So, I just found
traffic camera footage

10:15.859 --> 10:17.859
from the corner
of Grand and Wilshire

10:17.861 --> 10:18.893
at the time of the shooting.

10:18.895 --> 10:20.527
DEEKS:
Is that it-- the car Sam saw?

10:20.529 --> 10:23.563
NELL:
Yep, and supposedly
rented to a Jason Adams.

10:23.565 --> 10:26.866
But I think we know him
by a different name.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.601
CIA Officer

10:28.603 --> 10:30.869
Vostanik Sabatino.

10:30.871 --> 10:32.804
Why wouldn't Callen tell us
he was meeting with Sabatino?

10:32.806 --> 10:35.706
More importantly, why would
anyone name their kid Vostanik?

10:35.708 --> 10:37.391
I never
understood that.

10:37.392 --> 10:39.075
Pretty sure it's Armenian.
Yeah, that's no excuse.

10:39.078 --> 10:40.777
Why wouldn't he just take him
to the boatshed?

10:40.779 --> 10:42.512
Maybe it's not Callen
that's caught up in something.

10:42.514 --> 10:43.546
Maybe it's Sabatino.

10:43.548 --> 10:45.514
CIA are a spooky bunch.

10:45.516 --> 10:47.249
That's my girl.

10:47.251 --> 10:50.118
Okay, so how do we
find Sabatino?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.086
Isn't there an app for that?

10:52.088 --> 10:53.854
Come on, it's not like
we can just call up the CIA,

10:53.856 --> 10:55.822
and be like, "Hey, Sabatino."

10:55.824 --> 10:56.889
I don't think

10:56.891 --> 10:59.892
we're gonna have to.

10:59.894 --> 11:01.627
Now what?

11:08.001 --> 11:10.868
You told Eric he could begin
weapons training?

11:10.870 --> 11:13.937
What were you thinking?

11:13.939 --> 11:17.974
Well, I thought it was
a hell of a lot safer to...

11:17.976 --> 11:19.809
have him trained.

11:19.811 --> 11:23.112
Is there any news on Mr. Callen?

11:23.114 --> 11:24.847
You know as much as I do.

11:24.849 --> 11:26.365
What am I thinking?

11:26.366 --> 11:27.882
You probably know
a lot more than I do.

11:27.885 --> 11:29.684
Oh, not enough.

11:29.686 --> 11:32.186
He was working
on a Chinese computer

11:32.188 --> 11:34.288
with a portable sat link

11:34.290 --> 11:35.856
at his house this morning.

11:35.858 --> 11:38.291
Maybe he's got a new pen pal
in Nantong.

11:38.293 --> 11:40.126
(chuckles)

11:40.127 --> 11:41.960
I once found him in a bathtub
full of ice water

11:41.963 --> 11:43.862
trying to escape
from a straitjacket,

11:43.864 --> 11:45.430
and to this day he won't tell me

11:45.431 --> 11:46.997
how he got in the damn thing
in the first place.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.668
If Callen is going
to all this trouble

11:50.670 --> 11:53.904
to keep us out of the loop,
I'm sure he has a good reason.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.939
Find anything?

11:55.941 --> 11:57.624
Yeah.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.308
The guy Callen was meeting
was CIA Officer Sabatino.

11:59.311 --> 12:02.111
Granger is still trying
to figure out why.

12:02.113 --> 12:03.579
And Callen?

12:03.581 --> 12:05.747
Well, his phone's turned off,

12:05.749 --> 12:07.215
and his car is still parked
in his driveway.

12:07.217 --> 12:09.951
So he must have
swept himself clean.

12:09.953 --> 12:11.953
He is completely
off the grid,

12:11.955 --> 12:14.255
and we have no real way
of finding him.

12:14.257 --> 12:16.023
Shut down his aliases.

12:16.025 --> 12:18.225
No, he keeps open-ended tickets

12:18.227 --> 12:19.993
that leapfrog
between different countries

12:19.995 --> 12:21.160
under different aliases.

12:21.162 --> 12:24.029
Makes it almost impossible
to track him.

12:24.031 --> 12:25.997
Do your best.

12:25.999 --> 12:28.065
(softly): Will do.

12:29.201 --> 12:30.967
I'm afraid.

12:30.969 --> 12:32.868
There's part of Mr. Callen

12:32.870 --> 12:35.804
that will always be
that young boy,

12:35.806 --> 12:37.705
lost in the foster system,

12:37.707 --> 12:40.140
searching for home.

12:40.142 --> 12:41.374
I thought

12:41.376 --> 12:44.109
he'd found it here.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.279
But I think I'm wrong.

12:53.018 --> 12:55.752
We'll find him.

12:55.754 --> 12:57.820
(indistinct chatter)

13:02.792 --> 13:04.258
Oh, NCIS!

13:04.260 --> 13:06.994
Don't tell me,
you want to kill me again?

13:06.996 --> 13:08.228
Not yet.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.963
Where's the cute, furry one?

13:09.965 --> 13:13.333
Deeks wasn't able to make it,
but he sends his regards.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.801
Mmm.

13:14.803 --> 13:16.402
Would you like to take a dip?

13:18.773 --> 13:20.939
I'm more of a shower type guy.

13:20.941 --> 13:22.941
Well, that can be arranged, too.

13:22.943 --> 13:23.908
You're not my type.

13:23.910 --> 13:26.110
What is your type?

13:26.112 --> 13:27.945
The type that gives me
what I need.

13:27.947 --> 13:29.012
What do you need?

13:29.014 --> 13:32.348
A fellow ex-pat.

13:32.350 --> 13:34.049
Arkady Kolcheck.

13:34.051 --> 13:35.917
I think you know who he is.

13:35.919 --> 13:37.919
The last time I helped you...

13:37.920 --> 13:39.920
You helped yourself
by getting rid of Sidorov.

13:39.923 --> 13:43.758
And how would I be
helping myself this time?

13:44.827 --> 13:47.894
I'll give you everything
the CIA has on your operations.

13:47.896 --> 13:49.896
If you are willing to do that,

13:49.898 --> 13:51.330
it means
they don't know anything.

13:51.332 --> 13:52.998
You don't strike me
as a traitor.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.299
Sorry.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.000
What do you want?

13:57.036 --> 13:59.036
Well, how about
your friend Deeks?

13:59.038 --> 14:00.937
He's taken.

14:00.939 --> 14:02.872
A pity.

14:02.874 --> 14:06.141
Do you have
an appreciation for art?

14:07.244 --> 14:10.378
This painting was
taken from me.

14:14.817 --> 14:16.316
So call LAPD.

14:16.318 --> 14:18.217
They have
an art theft division.

14:18.219 --> 14:20.686
It's complicated.

14:20.687 --> 14:23.154
Meaning it was already stolen
when it was in your possession?

14:23.157 --> 14:24.956
Like I said, complicated.

14:24.958 --> 14:28.059
But if you would return it,

14:28.061 --> 14:31.095
I would feel so very grateful,

14:31.097 --> 14:33.464
I would be obligated
to help you.

14:34.934 --> 14:36.867
Why don't you have your guys
take it back?

14:36.869 --> 14:40.003
Would you drive a tank
on a golf course?

14:40.005 --> 14:42.071
They're built for brute force.

14:42.073 --> 14:43.839
This requires a subtle touch

14:43.841 --> 14:46.408
and a set of skills
they do not possess.

14:46.410 --> 14:47.709
Mm-hmm.

14:47.711 --> 14:49.377
Who has the painting?

14:49.379 --> 14:51.846
The name is, uh,

14:51.848 --> 14:52.847
Artem Kunetzov.

14:52.849 --> 14:54.849
They call him the Gargul'ya.

14:54.851 --> 14:55.916
The gargoyle?

14:55.918 --> 14:57.918
You'll understand
if you see him.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.953
Uh, but you don't want that
to happen.

14:59.955 --> 15:01.387
Why is that?

15:01.389 --> 15:02.855
Because if you do,

15:02.857 --> 15:05.891
you know, chances are,
you've been caught

15:05.893 --> 15:08.860
and, uh, he'll be the last thing
you ever see.

15:08.862 --> 15:10.294
So, um,

15:10.296 --> 15:12.763
we have a deal, yes?

15:13.499 --> 15:15.198
You'll find Arkady Kolcheck

15:15.200 --> 15:17.833
if I steal this painting?

15:17.835 --> 15:19.868
That's a good trade.

15:19.870 --> 15:23.370
It's not as if I'm asking you
to betray your country.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.841
Not yet, anyway.

15:43.124 --> 15:45.190
Hey, Granger.

15:49.528 --> 15:51.861
You recognize this guy?

15:53.331 --> 15:54.496
Yeah.

15:54.498 --> 15:56.898
His name's Santiago Gonzalez.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.401
We've been playing cat and mouse
for a while.

16:00.403 --> 16:03.237
We suspect he may have been
working for Venezuela's

16:03.239 --> 16:05.539
General Directorate
of Military Counterintelligence.

16:05.541 --> 16:07.207
Why is he dead?

16:07.209 --> 16:09.509
He was following Callen
the night you two met.

16:11.379 --> 16:13.212
Sam capped him.

16:13.214 --> 16:15.314
That's six months
down the drain.

16:15.316 --> 16:18.050
Any idea why he'd want
to whack Callen?

16:18.052 --> 16:19.885
Boredom? Fun?

16:19.887 --> 16:21.419
Guy's one sick puppy.

16:21.421 --> 16:23.788
Well, at least he was.

16:23.790 --> 16:25.556
But he wasn't following Callen.

16:25.558 --> 16:27.524
He was following me.

16:27.526 --> 16:29.392
Must have made me
when we met.

16:29.394 --> 16:32.328
Probably, uh, thought
he could grab Callen

16:32.330 --> 16:33.829
and use him to get to me.

16:33.831 --> 16:36.932
Guess he thought wrong.

16:36.934 --> 16:39.367
What were you meeting
with Callen about?

16:40.303 --> 16:41.568
Shouldn't you be asking him?

16:41.570 --> 16:43.536
What makes you think I haven't?

16:43.538 --> 16:45.237
Not like you to be in the dark.

16:45.239 --> 16:47.872
I live in the dark.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.541
I'm not asking you again,
not nicely.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.143
You really don't know.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.578
Hmm.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.013
Arkady Kolcheck.

16:58.015 --> 16:59.447
What about him?

16:59.449 --> 17:00.881
Callen wanted to know

17:00.883 --> 17:02.983
if the agency knew
if he was still alive,

17:02.985 --> 17:05.986
and if so,
where he was being held.

17:05.988 --> 17:07.420
I couldn't give him anything.

17:07.422 --> 17:10.356
We have no confirmation
on his death.

17:10.358 --> 17:12.224
If they killed him,

17:12.226 --> 17:13.992
they did it quietly.

17:13.994 --> 17:15.226
If he's still alive,

17:15.228 --> 17:17.194
they're keeping his whereabouts
under wraps.

17:17.196 --> 17:18.495
What else?

17:19.898 --> 17:22.431
He wanted to know
if we had any new information

17:22.433 --> 17:24.466
on Anatoli Kirkin.

17:24.468 --> 17:26.501
He didn't say why.

17:28.471 --> 17:29.603
ERIC:
Who is Anatoli Kirkin again?

17:29.605 --> 17:31.538
Deeks' bathhouse buddy.

17:31.540 --> 17:32.839
He's a Russian mobster.

17:32.841 --> 17:35.041
With very soft skin.

17:35.043 --> 17:36.542
He's former KGB.

17:36.544 --> 17:38.010
Best known for his, uh,

17:38.012 --> 17:39.578
participation in
the Active Measures program,

17:39.580 --> 17:43.114
aka violent political warfare.

17:43.116 --> 17:45.549
After the wall came down,
he ended up in prison

17:45.551 --> 17:47.951
before he escaped
and fled to the U.S.

17:47.953 --> 17:51.187
He, uh, gave up some
state secrets for amnesty.

17:51.189 --> 17:53.106
Now he's free as a bird.

17:53.107 --> 17:55.024
A bird who still has links
to the Russian underground.

17:55.026 --> 17:58.060
Including the most powerful
prison gangs in Russia.

17:58.062 --> 18:00.195
If Arkady's still alive,

18:00.197 --> 18:02.497
maybe Callen thinks
Kirkin can find him.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.632
G still has loyalty to Arkady.

18:04.634 --> 18:07.534
Partly because he's
Callen's last link to his past.

18:07.536 --> 18:10.470
Ever since we left Russia,
he's been trying to find him.

18:10.472 --> 18:12.205
Every day that goes by,

18:12.207 --> 18:14.106
I think it's less
and less likely he ever will.

18:14.108 --> 18:15.607
So Callen obviously feels like
he's running out of time,

18:15.609 --> 18:16.941
and he's desperate enough

18:16.943 --> 18:18.542
to contact Kirkin,
a Russian mobster.

18:18.544 --> 18:20.243
The bigger question here is,

18:20.245 --> 18:22.645
what is Kirkin getting in return
for helping Callen?

18:25.149 --> 18:26.615
If Callen is gonna contact him,

18:26.617 --> 18:28.483
I think that he'll probably
go to the one place

18:28.485 --> 18:29.884
we know he operates from.

18:29.886 --> 18:31.552
What are you looking at me for?

18:31.554 --> 18:33.153
No, no, if anyone's getting
naked this time,

18:33.155 --> 18:34.220
its gonna be you.

18:34.222 --> 18:35.654
ERIC:
You really got naked?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.088
It's a bathhouse;
it's required.

18:37.090 --> 18:38.556
Eric, search all
the surveillance footage

18:38.558 --> 18:39.557
around that location.

18:39.559 --> 18:41.225
See if you can spot Callen,

18:41.227 --> 18:42.492
especially what he's driving.

18:42.494 --> 18:43.659
I'm going to G's house.
Yeah.

18:43.661 --> 18:45.360
What do you want us to do?

18:45.362 --> 18:47.395
I want you

18:47.397 --> 18:48.997
to stake out the bathhouse,

18:48.998 --> 18:50.598
in case Callen does show up
at that location.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.999
I'm not going back in there.

18:52.001 --> 18:53.300
I'm telling you,
I'm still having nightmares

18:53.302 --> 18:55.135
about big,
sweaty men drowning me.

18:55.137 --> 18:56.669
That's too much
information, Deeks.

18:56.671 --> 18:59.538
Way too much.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.606
(lawn mower running)

19:27.667 --> 19:30.067
¶ ¶

19:48.987 --> 19:51.554
(beeps)

19:51.556 --> 19:52.721
G, you here?

19:52.723 --> 19:54.155
We need to talk.

19:56.459 --> 19:59.626
If you're watching or listening,
I'm sorry to intrude,

19:59.628 --> 20:02.261
but this is what you get
when you shut me out.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.300
You know
I wouldn't do this to you.

20:10.302 --> 20:12.602
Yeah, right.

20:12.604 --> 20:14.570
And if I did,
I was wrong to do so,

20:14.572 --> 20:17.372
but you got to talk to me, G.

20:17.374 --> 20:19.073
You're talking to me now.

20:19.075 --> 20:21.708
And don't say I<i> am</i> talking
to you, all right?

20:21.710 --> 20:23.176
You know what I mean.

20:23.177 --> 20:24.643
Face-to-face, man-to-man,
me and you.

20:24.646 --> 20:25.845
The others don't have to know,

20:25.846 --> 20:27.045
but you got to let me
into this thing.

20:27.048 --> 20:29.715
(phone ringing)

20:29.717 --> 20:31.249
Thank you.

20:31.251 --> 20:33.150
For what?

20:33.152 --> 20:34.384
Eric?

20:34.386 --> 20:35.685
Yeah. Who were you expecting?

20:35.687 --> 20:37.453
What do you want?

20:37.455 --> 20:39.221
Uh, me, nothing,
but Granger wants you back here.

20:39.223 --> 20:40.422
Why?

20:40.424 --> 20:42.056
I don't know,
he looked pretty serious.

20:42.058 --> 20:44.158
And, uh, I think it's
about Callen.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.325
Yeah. Okay.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.726
I'm on my way.

20:46.728 --> 20:48.260
I'm serious, man.

20:48.262 --> 20:50.161
Call me.

21:01.307 --> 21:04.274
(in Russian accent):
You sure you don't
want to get naked?

21:05.210 --> 21:06.275
(chuckles)

21:06.277 --> 21:08.342
Really? That was a softball.

21:11.347 --> 21:12.646
Okay, I get it.

21:12.648 --> 21:14.781
I'm gonna get the silent
monkey treatment.

21:14.783 --> 21:17.049
Have to admit,

21:17.051 --> 21:18.417
it's kind of peaceful.

21:18.419 --> 21:19.718
I just keep racking my brain,

21:19.720 --> 21:22.020
going over every single case
I've ever worked,

21:22.022 --> 21:24.522
trying to figure out
what sparked Internal Affairs.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.624
Well...

21:27.626 --> 21:29.559
Maybe it wasn't one of yours.

21:29.561 --> 21:30.760
What do you mean?

21:30.762 --> 21:32.228
Maybe it was
somebody else's case.

21:32.230 --> 21:33.762
Something that you were
working on peripherally,

21:33.764 --> 21:36.731
and therefore you don't
remember any of the details.

21:36.733 --> 21:40.101
And plus, you haven't heard
from them in a month.

21:40.103 --> 21:42.153
They probably dropped it.

21:42.154 --> 21:44.204
I found somebody going through
my recycling bin last week.

21:44.207 --> 21:46.240
Big deal. I find people going
through my recycling bins

21:46.242 --> 21:48.075
all the time looking for cans
and bottles. So what?

21:48.077 --> 21:49.643
Except for the fact this guy
was wearing a suit,

21:49.645 --> 21:52.545
driving an unmarked Crown Vic
with California Exempt plates.

21:52.547 --> 21:54.280
What?
Yeah.

21:54.282 --> 21:55.514
Why didn't you tell me this?

21:55.516 --> 21:56.615
What? I'm telling you now.

21:56.617 --> 21:58.717
No. What else aren't
you telling me?

21:58.719 --> 22:00.652
Um, that's my point--
I don't know.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.320
Deeks, this is the point
where you say,

22:02.322 --> 22:04.121
"Kensi, don't worry, I-I don't
hide anything from you."

22:04.123 --> 22:05.589
So what's going on here?

22:05.591 --> 22:07.724
All right, here's another one.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.592
When I was a rookie detective,

22:09.594 --> 22:11.727
they partnered me up with
this guy that was old-school.

22:11.729 --> 22:14.262
I mean, like,
old-school methods

22:14.264 --> 22:16.264
and methods
that weren't exactly...

22:16.266 --> 22:17.732
in keeping
with department policy.

22:17.734 --> 22:18.799
Such as?

22:18.801 --> 22:20.667
Such as-- on my very first day,

22:20.669 --> 22:23.236
got a suspect to talk by using
a pot of scalding-hot coffee.

22:23.238 --> 22:25.137
What did you do?
What do you mean, what did I do?

22:25.139 --> 22:26.771
I confronted him,
and he responded to that

22:26.773 --> 22:27.772
by putting his gun in my mouth.

22:27.774 --> 22:29.473
Did you report him?

22:29.475 --> 22:31.808
Of course I did, 'cause
that's the right thing to do.
And?

22:31.810 --> 22:33.476
And at that point,
no one wanted to work with me.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.810
Which is why I started
doing undercover work.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.745
Is this jackass still
on the force?

22:37.714 --> 22:38.713
No.

22:38.715 --> 22:40.648
No, he's dead.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.851
How?

22:43.853 --> 22:46.520
I don't know.

22:46.522 --> 22:50.190
You know, they, uh... found him
in this Hollywood motel.

22:50.192 --> 22:51.191
Mm-hmm.

22:51.193 --> 22:53.193
Shot with his own gun.

22:53.195 --> 22:56.863
Rumor was that he used to get
really high and beat up hookers,

22:56.865 --> 22:59.265
so the investigators
just assumed

22:59.267 --> 23:01.600
that... he was whaling
on some poor girl,

23:01.602 --> 23:03.668
and she got ahold of his gun
and unloaded it.

23:06.205 --> 23:08.538
If there's something
that I need to know,

23:08.540 --> 23:11.107
then you need to tell me.

23:12.543 --> 23:15.210
I would if I could,
I just don't know.

23:16.746 --> 23:18.812
(phone rings)

23:19.881 --> 23:21.814
Yeah, what's up, Eric?

23:21.816 --> 23:25.384
Hey, so Granger wants you guys
to report back here.

23:25.386 --> 23:26.852
Why? What's going on?

23:26.854 --> 23:29.521
Uh, he didn't say,
but he's in Hetty's office,

23:29.523 --> 23:31.122
and he looks pretty serious.

23:31.124 --> 23:33.457
No, I'm pretty sure
that's just how his face looks.

23:33.459 --> 23:35.792
He had me call in Sam, too.

23:35.794 --> 23:36.793
All right.

23:36.795 --> 23:38.294
All right, we're
on our way.

23:39.864 --> 23:41.630
So you know what
Callen's up to, right?

23:41.632 --> 23:44.466
He hasn't said anything to me.

23:46.236 --> 23:48.302
That's not the answer
to my question.

23:50.606 --> 23:54.307
I don't know anything
more than you, Owen.

23:54.309 --> 23:57.710
All right, he went to
Sabatino to ask about Arkady.

23:57.712 --> 24:00.713
And when that didn't work out,
he went to Anatoli Kirkin.

24:00.715 --> 24:03.282
He's afraid
of losing Arkady,

24:03.284 --> 24:05.284
who's his only connection
to the past.

24:05.286 --> 24:06.885
You know that.

24:08.521 --> 24:10.187
Well, if he'd been up-front
about this whole thing,

24:10.189 --> 24:11.855
we wouldn't be having
this conversation,

24:11.857 --> 24:13.523
but as it is, Hanna
has been locked out,

24:13.525 --> 24:15.491
and you and I both
know what that means.

24:15.493 --> 24:18.160
And I understand
what he means to you.

24:18.162 --> 24:19.828
I really do.

24:19.830 --> 24:21.863
But this is not the time
to be playing favorites.

24:21.865 --> 24:24.932
I do not play favorites.

24:24.934 --> 24:27.234
But you still have 'em.

24:27.236 --> 24:29.903
And by all accounts,
yours is gearing up

24:29.905 --> 24:34.240
to make an unsanctioned rescue
attempt in a foreign country

24:34.242 --> 24:37.576
that would not only ruin
both of our careers,

24:37.578 --> 24:40.912
but the political ramifications
would be horrific.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.481
What would you have me do?

24:43.483 --> 24:45.483
Bring him in by force
if necessary.

24:45.485 --> 24:47.218
It's for his own good,
and you know it.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.887
I cannot ask this team

24:49.889 --> 24:52.356
to apprehend Agent Callen.

24:52.358 --> 24:55.359
Then I'll ask a favor of the
Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal

24:55.361 --> 24:57.494
in L.A. and have
his boys grab him.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.895
Callen has to
be stopped.

25:03.567 --> 25:05.633
You can't expect us to
bring in one of our own.

25:05.635 --> 25:07.501
There's no way Hetty
approved of this.

25:07.503 --> 25:09.836
Listen, she doesn't like it
any more than you or I do,

25:09.838 --> 25:12.405
but Callen hasn't exactly
left us any other option.

25:12.407 --> 25:13.939
Not to play the devil's
idiot on this,

25:13.941 --> 25:15.140
but aren't we overreacting?

25:15.141 --> 25:16.340
I mean, at this point,
all Callen has done

25:16.343 --> 25:17.942
is seek out information.

25:17.944 --> 25:20.511
It's what he's gonna do with the
information that concerns us.

25:20.513 --> 25:21.845
You don't know
what he's gonna do.

25:21.847 --> 25:23.813
Yeah, maybe he's gonna
send Arkady a postcard

25:23.815 --> 25:25.381
or a cake with a file in it.

25:25.382 --> 25:26.948
He's ignored all of our requests
to report in.

25:26.951 --> 25:28.283
What would you do?

25:30.453 --> 25:33.420
I'm having Eric and Nell put
a full-court press on Callen.

25:33.422 --> 25:34.754
If you'll agree to bring him in,

25:34.756 --> 25:36.255
I can guarantee
a first crack at him,

25:36.257 --> 25:38.257
which would be
the safest way to do this.

25:38.259 --> 25:40.259
If you're saying
you won't,

25:40.261 --> 25:42.828
the marshal's Fugitive
Task Force team will.

25:42.830 --> 25:45.897
And I can't guarantee
the outcome.

25:48.268 --> 25:50.333
Granger.

25:52.537 --> 25:53.869
We'll do it.

25:53.871 --> 25:55.337
We'll bring in Callen.

25:55.339 --> 25:57.739
Good.

26:09.719 --> 26:11.719
I have to tell you--
this feels wrong.

26:11.721 --> 26:13.854
I mean, why doesn't
Hetty just trust

26:13.856 --> 26:15.388
Callen knows
what he's doing?

26:15.390 --> 26:17.857
She does... I think.

26:17.859 --> 26:20.526
So, then why are
we doing this?

26:20.528 --> 26:22.995
I don't know.

26:22.997 --> 26:25.530
Look, you've known Callen
longer than I have.

26:25.532 --> 26:29.633
Do you really think he's capable
of doing something this crazy?

26:29.635 --> 26:31.334
No.

26:31.336 --> 26:32.802
Unless...

26:32.804 --> 26:34.637
Unless what?

26:34.639 --> 26:36.839
Unless he snapped.

26:36.841 --> 26:39.808
Snapped, Eric?

26:39.810 --> 26:42.477
<i> The Manchurian Candidate,</i>

26:42.479 --> 26:45.480
<i> The Ipcress File, Telefon--</i>

26:45.482 --> 26:47.815
all spies who one day
just lose it.

26:47.817 --> 26:51.385
Also all fictitious
mind control movies.

26:51.387 --> 26:52.986
Truth is stranger
than fiction.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.721
I think maybe<i> you're </i>
stranger than fiction.

26:54.723 --> 26:55.722
Okay.
Okay.

26:55.724 --> 26:56.723
Yeah.
There you go.

26:56.725 --> 26:58.591
Got anything?

26:58.593 --> 27:00.059
Uh, no, not yet.

27:00.061 --> 27:02.061
Come on, guys, this is
Callen we're talking about.

27:02.063 --> 27:03.729
You know more about him
and his habits

27:03.731 --> 27:05.063
than most of the other guys
we've found.

27:05.065 --> 27:07.065
True, but Callen is also
extremely well-trained

27:07.067 --> 27:08.733
and knows exactly
how to avoid

27:08.735 --> 27:10.601
the very things we are
doing to try to find him.

27:10.603 --> 27:11.935
Okay, well, maybe we're
missing something.

27:11.937 --> 27:13.736
Or maybe he snapped.

27:13.738 --> 27:15.304
What?
Don't.

27:15.306 --> 27:17.706
Callen is a highly
skilled operative,

27:17.708 --> 27:20.575
trained to act
independently

27:20.577 --> 27:22.710
under extreme
and dangerous circumstances.

27:22.712 --> 27:27.580
Sometimes individuals in those
high-stress positions...

27:27.582 --> 27:29.081
go all Jason Bourne.

27:29.083 --> 27:31.083
Come on.

27:31.085 --> 27:32.751
He's just kidding.

27:32.753 --> 27:34.753
Maybe.

27:34.755 --> 27:36.688
But maybe he's right.

27:36.690 --> 27:38.623
I'm sorry, what?

27:38.625 --> 27:40.358
Yeah? You think so?

27:42.462 --> 27:46.931
Unless the real Callen
was locked away, replaced...

27:46.933 --> 27:48.732
by a clone.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.600
Or a robot.

27:50.602 --> 27:53.069
You're mocking me.

27:53.071 --> 27:55.504
He's got a mind like a computer.

27:55.506 --> 27:58.874
Unfortunately,
it's a Commodore 64.

27:58.876 --> 28:00.909
I warned you.

28:00.911 --> 28:03.978
Keep looking.

28:03.980 --> 28:06.580
It's the best-selling computer
of all time, by the way.

28:09.418 --> 28:10.917
Fine, I'll do it.

28:10.919 --> 28:12.451
What?

28:12.453 --> 28:13.919
I will go to the
Russian bathhouse

28:13.921 --> 28:15.787
and literally expose
myself to Kirkin

28:15.789 --> 28:17.555
in hopes that he tells
me what he told Callen.

28:17.557 --> 28:19.723
And what if he doesn't tell you
what he told Callen?

28:19.725 --> 28:21.691
Well, then at least I'll
come home squeaky clean.

28:21.693 --> 28:23.693
Huh.
What options do
we have here?

28:23.695 --> 28:26.929
Well, one option would be to
subpoena Kirkin's phone lines,

28:26.931 --> 28:28.797
and if he made a subsequent call
on Callen's behalf,

28:28.799 --> 28:29.931
maybe that'll give us
some clues.

28:29.933 --> 28:31.465
All right, I can try
to expedite it

28:31.467 --> 28:33.467
under a national
security threat.

28:33.469 --> 28:34.701
You don't need
a subpoena

28:34.703 --> 28:36.402
if you already have
someone listening in.

28:36.404 --> 28:37.403
I don't follow.

28:37.405 --> 28:38.404
Callen went to Sabatino

28:38.406 --> 28:39.872
for information on Arkady.
Right.

28:39.874 --> 28:41.740
When he didn't have that,

28:41.742 --> 28:43.708
he asked him for everything
he had on Anatoli Kirkin.

28:43.710 --> 28:45.843
Which suggests the CIA
already has Kirkin

28:45.845 --> 28:47.411
under electronic surveillance.

28:47.413 --> 28:48.612
Exactly.

28:48.614 --> 28:52.148
I'll contact Sabatino... again.

28:56.754 --> 28:58.453
This is what we have on Kirkin.

28:58.455 --> 28:59.787
He's a crook, yes,

28:59.789 --> 29:01.822
but not someone we consider
a terrorist threat

29:01.824 --> 29:04.825
in the bigger scheme of things.

29:04.826 --> 29:07.827
His ideology is, uh, based on
one thing: money and lots of it.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.897
He does, however, have ties
to the gangs in Russia,

29:10.899 --> 29:12.665
which is what I think
Callen was looking for.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.133
ERIC: Uh, guys.
You find him, Eric?

29:14.135 --> 29:15.801
No, but LAPD did.

29:15.803 --> 29:17.135
They're in pursuit now.

29:17.137 --> 29:18.870
Callen's giving 'em
a run for their money.

29:18.872 --> 29:21.005
Tell 'em to maintain their
pursuit, but do not engage.

29:21.007 --> 29:22.773
Talk us in, Eric.

29:22.775 --> 29:24.407
GRANGER:
Alert Hetty.

29:24.409 --> 29:26.675
<i> Where is he now, Eric?</i>

29:26.677 --> 29:27.942
They've cornered him
along the river.

29:27.944 --> 29:30.577
Now, somehow I doubt that.
Hang on.

29:43.658 --> 29:44.790
Where is he?

29:44.792 --> 29:46.658
He escaped on foot.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.792
He's somewhere
in these three blocks,

29:47.794 --> 29:49.593
but we called in
for a K-9 unit.

29:49.595 --> 29:51.595
N-N-No, we don't need that.
Kensi, Deeks.

29:52.931 --> 29:54.864
All right, we got this.

30:01.439 --> 30:02.905
HETTY:
Mr. Callen!

30:02.907 --> 30:05.908
This has gone on long enough.

30:05.910 --> 30:08.443
I'm on sick
leave, remember?

30:08.445 --> 30:11.712
Please don't turn
your back on me again.

30:11.714 --> 30:13.180
I'm sorry, Hetty.

30:13.182 --> 30:15.048
I'm sorry, too.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.951
(groans)

30:20.754 --> 30:21.786
Oh, my God.

30:21.788 --> 30:23.687
Oh, my God,
th-this isn't happening.

30:23.689 --> 30:24.821
Nell, what's happening?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.956
NELL:
Hetty just tasered Callen.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.424
What?!

30:28.425 --> 30:29.891
That's not good.
That's not good.

30:29.894 --> 30:32.694
(groaning)

30:36.132 --> 30:37.898
Come on.

30:39.201 --> 30:41.201
(groans)

30:41.203 --> 30:43.469
Bugger.

31:01.789 --> 31:03.789
T-Time to be
cool, partner.

31:03.791 --> 31:04.790
Be cool.

31:04.792 --> 31:05.924
Let me go.

31:05.926 --> 31:06.925
Sam...

31:06.927 --> 31:08.927
Stop making me
do this, G.

31:08.929 --> 31:10.994
No one's making you
do anything.

31:13.798 --> 31:16.799
Have you looked
at yourself?

31:16.801 --> 31:18.267
When's the last
time you slept?

31:18.269 --> 31:19.801
Or took a shower?

31:19.803 --> 31:21.269
Come on, man,
I'm working the streets.

31:21.271 --> 31:22.937
You look like the
streets are working you.

31:22.939 --> 31:24.939
I got this.

31:24.941 --> 31:27.274
Sam...

31:27.276 --> 31:29.276
I know what I'm doing.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.945
Please.

31:31.947 --> 31:33.880
Partner?

31:39.587 --> 31:41.053
You're not acting
like a partner.

31:41.055 --> 31:43.855
Maybe not,
but I'm asking you to.

31:43.857 --> 31:46.224
You owe me big time.

31:46.226 --> 31:48.025
Thank you.

31:54.666 --> 31:56.732
Hey, any sign of him?

31:56.734 --> 32:00.068
I think we lost him.

32:00.070 --> 32:02.070
All right.

32:02.072 --> 32:03.204
Let's keep looking.

32:03.206 --> 32:05.139
Okay.

32:18.987 --> 32:21.053
It's gonna get ugly.

32:21.889 --> 32:24.256
I am so disappointed in you.

32:24.258 --> 32:25.257
And why is that?

32:25.259 --> 32:27.158
You let him walk away.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.826
Did I?

32:28.828 --> 32:31.562
I didn't see anyone else here
try to stop him, including you.

32:31.564 --> 32:33.864
I made an unsuccessful attempt.

32:33.866 --> 32:36.566
Why don't you just slow your
roll until you know the facts?

32:36.568 --> 32:40.570
Why don't you
just step off...

32:40.572 --> 32:44.607
before we do something here
that we could live to regret?

32:44.609 --> 32:46.609
GRANGER:
That's enough.

32:46.611 --> 32:48.611
Both of you back off--
this isn't helping.

32:48.613 --> 32:51.013
I mean it.

32:51.015 --> 32:52.914
Hanna, go get
some air.

32:52.916 --> 32:54.649
And you, go drink
some tea or something.

32:54.651 --> 32:56.150
I don't need any air.

32:56.152 --> 32:57.985
I don't need any damn tea.

32:59.722 --> 33:00.887
Where are
you two going?

33:00.889 --> 33:02.221
Um, me?

33:02.223 --> 33:04.156
Uh, I'm-I'm with her.

33:04.158 --> 33:05.824
And we are going
back up to Ops.

33:05.826 --> 33:07.725
Get your butts down here.

33:07.727 --> 33:09.726
I need all hands on deck.

33:12.864 --> 33:14.864
Working together.

33:14.866 --> 33:17.233
If this team
worked together,

33:17.235 --> 33:19.969
Mr. Callen wouldn't have
been allowed to escape

33:19.971 --> 33:22.137
and we'd know where he is now.

33:22.139 --> 33:24.305
I didn't say
I didn't know where he is.

33:24.307 --> 33:25.706
You know
where Callen is?

33:25.708 --> 33:26.973
No.

33:26.975 --> 33:28.307
But we will,

33:28.309 --> 33:29.875
as soon as Eric pulls up
the tracking device

33:29.877 --> 33:31.676
I put on
his back.

33:31.678 --> 33:32.343
Hell yeah.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.046
Sam Hanna.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.636
ERIC:
That's him.

34:01.638 --> 34:02.737
He's in Bel Air.

34:02.739 --> 34:03.871
You're certain?

34:03.873 --> 34:05.205
That's the locator
I put on him.

34:05.207 --> 34:07.674
Unless he found it
and put in on somebody else.

34:07.676 --> 34:09.742
What are the chances of finding
somebody by the L.A. River

34:09.744 --> 34:10.909
who was going to Bel Air?

34:10.911 --> 34:12.828
NELL:
Okay, that home
is listed

34:12.829 --> 34:14.746
as being owned by
one Artem Kunetzov.

34:14.748 --> 34:15.813
DEEKS:
Fantastic,
more Russians.

34:15.815 --> 34:16.980
The guys that
invented a game

34:16.982 --> 34:18.314
where you put a loaded
gun to your head.

34:18.316 --> 34:19.315
Let us know if he moves.

34:19.317 --> 34:20.816
We will.

34:49.847 --> 34:51.913
¶ ¶

35:20.944 --> 35:22.410
¶ ¶

35:51.207 --> 35:53.340
¶ ¶

36:20.869 --> 36:22.869
(slow clapping)

36:22.871 --> 36:25.538
Bravo, Agent Callen.

36:25.540 --> 36:26.972
Bravo.

36:26.974 --> 36:28.940
I knew you were
the right man for the job.

36:28.942 --> 36:30.141
The hell is this?

36:30.143 --> 36:32.910
Turns out, uh, my comrade--

36:32.912 --> 36:34.311
Mr. Kunetzov, here--

36:34.313 --> 36:36.980
was willing to do me a deal
for the painting.

36:36.982 --> 36:38.848
Couldn't have told me that
before I broke in?

36:38.850 --> 36:40.316
Not really.

36:40.317 --> 36:41.783
Uh, the deal was for me
to get the painting back

36:41.786 --> 36:44.053
in exchange for you.

36:44.054 --> 36:46.321
Seems a federal agent is
very valuable these days.

36:46.323 --> 36:47.989
Everybody seems to want one.

36:47.991 --> 36:49.156
(chuckles)

36:49.158 --> 36:50.991
May I?

36:55.963 --> 36:56.962
(Kirkin shouts in Russian)

37:12.245 --> 37:14.111
Federal agents!
Drop your weapons!

37:14.113 --> 37:15.979
Don't be stupid, Kirkin.

37:15.981 --> 37:18.314
DEEKS:
Put 'em down!

37:18.316 --> 37:19.848
Put 'em down,
Milashka.

37:19.850 --> 37:20.982
Guns down!

37:20.984 --> 37:23.884
Put it down!

37:29.290 --> 37:32.124
Hands behind your back.

37:32.126 --> 37:34.059
Ooh, darling!

37:34.061 --> 37:37.028
Mmm, I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

37:37.030 --> 37:39.030
If I had a nickel...

37:39.032 --> 37:40.297
Get in the back.

37:44.069 --> 37:45.334
You good?

37:45.336 --> 37:47.269
(car door closes)

37:47.271 --> 37:48.270
Yeah.

37:48.272 --> 37:50.238
What, uh...

37:56.245 --> 37:57.211
...what took you
so long, huh?

37:57.212 --> 37:58.178
There's no way you knew
I tracked you.

37:58.180 --> 38:00.280
Please.
You are so predictable.

38:00.282 --> 38:01.414
Get out of here.

38:01.416 --> 38:04.116
You two are
just adorable.

38:16.062 --> 38:18.429
So? What do you think, Sherlock?

38:18.431 --> 38:22.132
Well, it's ultimately
for the experts to decide,

38:22.134 --> 38:25.001
but the original painting
was stolen

38:25.003 --> 38:27.903
from the Isabella Stewart
Gardner Museum in Boston.

38:27.905 --> 38:31.006
It's crazy how art has become
a favorite currency

38:31.008 --> 38:32.474
of drug dealers and terrorists.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.609
Yeah. No wonder.

38:34.611 --> 38:38.112
If this painting
is original,

38:38.114 --> 38:40.481
it's worth over
$200 million.

38:40.483 --> 38:41.582
Wow.

38:41.584 --> 38:43.584
So...

38:43.586 --> 38:44.585
Yeah.

38:44.587 --> 38:46.520
Just... be careful.

38:46.522 --> 38:50.190
Looks like I owe you an apology.

38:50.192 --> 38:53.126
No, you don't.

38:53.128 --> 38:54.594
I let him get away.

38:54.596 --> 38:56.162
You were right.

38:56.164 --> 38:58.597
But you made sure
that we could track him.

38:58.599 --> 39:00.198
Those weren't
my orders.

39:02.202 --> 39:03.501
You have every right
to be angry.

39:03.503 --> 39:07.271
I... take full responsibility
for what I did

39:07.273 --> 39:10.140
and any disciplinary
action you see fit.

39:10.142 --> 39:13.510
I put you in
a difficult position,

39:13.512 --> 39:15.345
and I'm not certain

39:15.347 --> 39:16.679
that I wouldn't have done

39:16.681 --> 39:18.213
the same thing.

39:18.215 --> 39:20.248
So what do we do
about Callen?

39:22.252 --> 39:25.319
Protect him as best we can...

39:25.321 --> 39:27.921
even if it's from himself.

39:29.057 --> 39:30.222
And you and me?

39:30.224 --> 39:33.091
I think this is

39:33.093 --> 39:35.226
where we kiss and make up.

39:35.228 --> 39:37.228
(laughs)

39:37.230 --> 39:39.496
"Kiss and make up"?

39:39.498 --> 39:41.431
(laughs)
Aw...

39:41.433 --> 39:44.033
Oh.

39:44.035 --> 39:46.101
(sighs)

39:47.204 --> 39:50.104
It is a privilege

39:50.106 --> 39:53.207
to have a man with your honor

39:53.209 --> 39:56.276
on this team, Mr. Hanna.

39:59.214 --> 40:00.513
It's an honor
to have the privilege

40:00.515 --> 40:02.181
of working with you, Hetty.

40:02.183 --> 40:04.349
(laughs)

40:04.351 --> 40:05.350
Come here.

40:05.352 --> 40:06.718
Wow.

40:09.055 --> 40:10.320
Oh, my gosh,
that is so sweet,

40:10.322 --> 40:12.188
it makes me
want to cry.
Uh-huh.

40:12.190 --> 40:15.357
You say sweet,
I say erotic.

40:15.359 --> 40:16.491
What?

40:16.493 --> 40:17.792
That... what...

40:17.793 --> 40:19.092
Why would you put
that image in my head?

40:19.095 --> 40:20.327
What are you
talking about?

40:20.329 --> 40:21.712
I'm just being honest
about my emotions.

40:21.713 --> 40:23.096
You don't have to be honest
about your emotions

40:23.098 --> 40:24.097
if you're gonna be
perverted about it.

40:24.099 --> 40:25.415
That, you can
hide from me.

40:25.416 --> 40:26.732
What, you think you're the
only person on the planet

40:26.734 --> 40:29.267
that doesn't think
<i> Fifty Shades of Hetty?</i>

40:29.269 --> 40:31.335
Dee... Ugh! Aah!

40:35.474 --> 40:38.641
I am sorry for
not including you.

40:38.643 --> 40:43.445
The time for apologies
is long past,

40:43.447 --> 40:45.647
Agent Callen.

40:45.649 --> 40:47.115
Fair enough.

40:48.685 --> 40:50.051
For the record,

40:50.053 --> 40:53.254
tasering me was...
a bit of a bitch move.

40:53.256 --> 40:55.589
I'm sorry.

40:55.591 --> 40:56.623
No, you're not.

40:58.460 --> 40:59.592
Not really.

41:10.504 --> 41:12.270
These my
termination papers?

41:12.272 --> 41:16.574
That is a list of
Kirkin's gang contacts

41:16.576 --> 41:18.309
in Russia and
Eastern Europe.

41:24.450 --> 41:25.749
CALLEN:
Huh.

41:25.751 --> 41:28.351
He'd rather sell out
his own gangs

41:28.353 --> 41:30.419
than join them in prison.

41:33.457 --> 41:38.192
Well, maybe this story has
a happy ending after all.

41:38.194 --> 41:40.727
These stories seldom end

41:40.729 --> 41:42.628
and never happily.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.496
Here.

41:44.498 --> 41:46.164
Take this.

41:46.166 --> 41:48.266
I hope it's worth
all the trouble.

41:49.235 --> 41:50.734
Maybe it will
help us find out

41:50.736 --> 41:54.404
what happened
to Arkady, but...

41:54.406 --> 41:59.374
if you use that
without my prior consent,

41:59.376 --> 42:01.676
you will be terminated

42:01.678 --> 42:03.577
immediately,

42:03.579 --> 42:05.512
with extreme prejudice.

42:05.514 --> 42:07.247
Hetty.

42:07.249 --> 42:10.283
I was just trying to protect
you and the agency.

42:10.285 --> 42:14.620
I don't require protection,
Mr. Callen...

42:14.622 --> 42:17.723
only loyalty.

42:17.725 --> 42:19.791
(sighs)

42:22.462 --> 42:24.295
Maybe we ought to, uh,

42:24.297 --> 42:27.598
discuss this over a drink?

42:27.600 --> 42:32.169
Not tonight.
Tonight we drink alone.
