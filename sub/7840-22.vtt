00:04.682 --> 00:07.878
Come on, everybody.
Time for the family portrait.

00:09.550 --> 00:12.154
Let's bunch together now.
Here we go.

00:13.293 --> 00:13.736
Move it!

00:15.056 --> 00:17.184
Perfecto.
Everybody smile.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.137
I'm going to set
the automatic timer.

00:22.635 --> 00:24.037
Almost ready.
Here we go.

00:24.062 --> 00:27.122
- Let's get this show on the road, man.
We got things to do.

00:27.142 --> 00:29.245
- Yeah, Dad.
- Okay, here we go.

00:29.907 --> 00:31.985
- Make room for Jumbo.
- What'd you say?

00:32.034 --> 00:34.964
- Nothing.
- All right everybody, squeeze in real tight.

00:35.448 --> 00:37.193
I want to get us all in
the picture this time.

00:38.063 --> 00:40.015
Closer.
Closer!

00:42.781 --> 00:46.944
Okay, hold still.
This is the last picture on the roll.

00:47.079 --> 00:48.068
Praise the Lord.

00:48.107 --> 00:50.414
- Watch your mouth, you little smart-ass.
- Yeah, Bart.

00:52.664 --> 00:55.553
Nothing's going to ruin this one.
The timer's a-ticking.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.647
- Bart's making faces, Dad.
- Bart!

00:59.207 --> 01:01.553
This one's going to be
the Simpsons at our finest.

01:01.941 --> 01:04.286
Smile, look cheerful.
Here we go.

01:05.479 --> 01:06.312
Here we go.

01:07.824 --> 01:08.600
Here we go.

Watering can.

01:42.466 --> 01:45.374
This is a nightmare.
We're getting blown out of the water.

01:45.529 --> 01:48.786
Uh, what can I say?
Maggie and I share a special bond.

01:55.091 --> 01:57.572
School bus?
Bart and Lisa?

01:58.513 --> 02:00.412
Bart and Lisa are
almost home from school,

02:00.490 --> 02:04.057
and we have a dentist appointment
at 3:00. Thanks, Maggie.

02:07.028 --> 02:10.633
We win by forfeit.
The sweetest win there is.

02:15.955 --> 02:16.866
It won't start.

02:18.582 --> 02:20.521
I'll just use Homer's
AAA card.

02:21.083 --> 02:24.068
American Applesauce Association?

02:25.615 --> 02:28.924
We're going to have to run.
There isn't even time to stretch my quads.

02:29.744 --> 02:30.888
My quads!

02:31.159 --> 02:33.578
Every stride is a nightmare!

02:57.714 --> 02:58.916
How you holding up, Maggie?

03:01.059 --> 03:01.892
Nooooo!

03:14.978 --> 03:15.928
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

03:24.346 --> 03:25.141
Hey, Marge.

03:31.192 --> 03:32.840
Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh!

03:51.688 --> 03:52.619
We're gonna make it.

03:54.344 --> 03:57.349
Marge Simpson, I just heard the
most delicious piece of gossip.

03:57.388 --> 03:58.648
Tell me later!

04:03.176 --> 04:06.491
Oh, hi, kids. You're just in time
to go to the dentist.

04:06.506 --> 04:09.898
Dentist? You said we were going to ride
dirt bikes around the cemetery.

04:10.049 --> 04:12.782
Oh, Bart, you fall for
that every six months.

04:13.979 --> 04:15.777
Hey, suckers,
check it out.

04:15.835 --> 04:19.149
Marge is taking me
to ride dirt bikes at the cemetery.

04:19.183 --> 04:21.257
You're going to the dentist, too, Dad.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.711
Why the cemetery, I wondered,
but my dreams were too strong.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.167
Ahhhh...

04:30.186 --> 04:32.823
Mr. Simpson, have you
been flossing regularly?

04:33.012 --> 04:35.149
Absolutely.
All the time.

04:35.469 --> 04:39.579
I go to the floss store and they're like,
"Whoa, there he is again. "

04:40.505 --> 04:43.684
- 'Cause I buy so much floss.
- Let's just get started.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.065
Oh, my God! My gums!

04:48.521 --> 04:51.400
- They hurt so much!
- I haven't started yet.

04:51.516 --> 04:54.540
I know, but a breeze from the window
went in my mouth.

05:00.704 --> 05:02.042
You butcher!

05:02.483 --> 05:06.108
Don't worry, sweetie. I'm sure that man
has some special tooth problem.

05:06.530 --> 05:09.166
I don't even have a special tooth problem!

05:09.641 --> 05:11.909
This is just a routine checkup!

05:15.317 --> 05:17.643
Oh, the bib is choking me!

05:18.026 --> 05:21.089
It's over?
That wasn't so bad.

05:21.588 --> 05:25.058
This tape explains oral hygiene
in a way that's exciting for kids.

05:25.262 --> 05:28.286
The U.S. dental association
presents:

05:28.344 --> 05:30.709
Menace tooth society.

05:38.575 --> 05:40.611
Damn, baby got bacteria.

05:40.708 --> 05:44.100
-You want to stick it to these whiteys?
- Hey, I'm down with OPP...

05:44.119 --> 05:46.485
"Ongoing periodontal problems. "

05:46.557 --> 05:47.449
Break it down.

05:59.924 --> 06:03.355

stop illin' with the fillin'.

06:06.389 --> 06:07.532

06:13.302 --> 06:16.753
I'm the enemy of the cavity
Unstoppable like gravity

06:16.917 --> 06:20.000
So brush with regularity
Or you will face calamity

06:20.194 --> 06:21.745
I'll see ya in Atlanta, GA

06:22.191 --> 06:24.052
Dirty, dirty mouth, y'all.

06:24.720 --> 06:28.423
This film is against tooth decay,
but it also kind of glamorizes it.

06:28.675 --> 06:29.829
Mixed signals, hmm...

06:32.712 --> 06:36.764
- This is the greatest movie ever.
- Dad, that's Ludicrous!

06:36.914 --> 06:41.072
- I have a right to my views.
- No! I mean Chris "Ludacris" Bridges,

06:41.075 --> 06:43.173
right here in the dental plaza!

06:43.241 --> 06:47.293
Hey, man, that video was made for a
onetimeonly showing in Canada,

06:47.477 --> 06:51.103
- Understand? Do ya?
- I'm sorry. There must have been some sort of misunder...

06:51.104 --> 06:55.292
Expect a letter from Cap In The Ass
Productions and its head legal counsel,

06:55.447 --> 06:57.705
Ms. Melissa Burlingame!
Peace out!

07:00.177 --> 07:02.619
Here's a free toothbrush.
Keep those teeth clean.

07:02.872 --> 07:06.865
So you're saying I should do your job
for you, at home, for free.

07:07.054 --> 07:07.694
You wish.

07:11.554 --> 07:14.016
Okay, Principal Skinner,
I want you to relax.

07:14.966 --> 07:18.552
Just lie completely at ease
while I administer the nitrous.

07:18.803 --> 07:19.579
I shall.

07:22.390 --> 07:23.960
The dentist will be here in a minute.

07:24.154 --> 07:27.333
He'll know exactly what he's doing.
Don't resist in any way.

07:38.054 --> 07:40.788
- Good afternoon, Principal Stinkface.
- Dr. Bart.

07:41.248 --> 07:45.474
Let's see... According to your charts,
you're due for your annual throat scraping.

07:46.318 --> 07:49.652
Uh-oh, I'm feeling a lot
of cooties down there.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.339
We may need to replace a tooth.

08:00.311 --> 08:00.874
Now rinse.

08:02.536 --> 08:05.890
Finally, I'm going to take an X ray,
so lie perfectly still for 20 minutes.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.088
Don' you love that clean mouth feeling?

08:12.355 --> 08:13.247
Sure do.

08:13.402 --> 08:16.794
- Let's go get ice cream.
- I can't wait to get the freshness out of my mouth.

08:16.882 --> 08:19.848
I'm going to glue my mouth shut
with butterscotch.

08:21.296 --> 08:23.157
Oh. Yay.

08:25.183 --> 08:28.770
- What the hell is a fundae?
- It's a sundae that's fun.

08:28.959 --> 08:31.450
I like that, but I'm on
a bit of a health kick.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.650
So I'll take
the low-fat vanilla...

08:33.796 --> 08:38.138
with the following mix-ins:
Snickles, Gooey Bears, Charlottesville Chew,

08:38.312 --> 08:43.897
Nice 'N' Many, Kat Kit, Herschel's Smooches,
Mrs. Bad Bar, and Mi Dudes.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.017
Cup or cone?

08:45.288 --> 08:46.820
Uh... cone!

08:52.446 --> 08:58.185
Congratulations. You just purchased the one
millionth ice-cream cone sold by this store!

08:58.698 --> 09:00.579
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

09:01.005 --> 09:03.172
Wait, I'm gonna be driving.
I'll go for the cup.

09:03.807 --> 09:06.404
- Dad!
- Fine, cone.

09:06.967 --> 09:08.246
What's this?!

09:09.710 --> 09:12.908
Tonight onSmartline,
a provocative discussion of the Middle East..

09:12.996 --> 09:14.101
will not be featured.

09:14.353 --> 09:17.920
Instead, we'll be talking to a man
who bought an ice-cream cone.

09:18.206 --> 09:19.117
That's me.

09:19.330 --> 09:20.881
Of course that has nothing
to do with the fact

09:20.929 --> 09:23.770
that this station and the ice-cream company
are owned by the same corporation,

09:23.789 --> 09:24.894
but I digress.

09:25.097 --> 09:26.571
All right, let's just get through this.

09:27.094 --> 09:30.637
Mr. Simpson, tell us how it felt
when you bought the fateful treat.

09:30.773 --> 09:34.902
I've never been to war, but I imagine
it feels just like your first kill.

09:35.101 --> 09:36.884
The happiness swept me away!

09:38.241 --> 09:40.122
That hurt like a *******

09:42.923 --> 09:46.529
- What'd I miss?
- Kent Brockman said a horrible swear.

09:46.616 --> 09:47.624
Which one?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.787
Uh, I'll Etch-A-Sketch it for you.

09:51.845 --> 09:53.822
Etch... sketch...
Etch... sketch...

09:54.709 --> 09:57.733
Shake it! Shake it!

09:58.179 --> 09:59.187
It won't come off.

10:00.535 --> 10:01.834
Where's the hammer?

10:07.330 --> 10:11.614
Earlier, on this broadcast I said a word
so vile it should only be uttered

10:11.633 --> 10:14.214
by Satan himself
while sitting on the toilet.

10:14.708 --> 10:17.616
I apologize,
and will make a large donation

10:17.616 --> 10:20.369
to charities that fight teen cursing.
Good night.

10:26.354 --> 10:27.478
Don't seem so mad.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.611
Uh, excuse me, sir. Did you see
my broadcast tonight?

10:32.683 --> 10:36.774
Oh, God, no, I get my news from the Internet
like every other normal person under 70.

10:36.919 --> 10:38.509
Farewell, dinosaur.

10:39.478 --> 10:40.835
No one saw my show.

10:41.165 --> 10:43.162
So, no one heard
my filthy faux pas.

10:43.637 --> 10:44.645
My career is safe.

10:44.824 --> 10:48.101
Well, the important thing is
we got through this crisis together.

10:48.304 --> 10:49.564
That makes us
friends, right?

10:50.378 --> 10:52.355
Uh, hey, look, it's the airport bus.
You should get on it.

10:52.685 --> 10:53.615
Okay.

10:57.309 --> 10:59.053
America West, please.

11:02.653 --> 11:05.154
I can't believe Kent Brockman
got away with it.

11:05.309 --> 11:08.406
Back in my day, TV stars
couldn't say "booby,"

11:08.498 --> 11:12.317
"tushie," "burp," "fanny burp,"
"water closet," "underpants,"

11:12.433 --> 11:14.585
"dingle-dangle,"
"Boston marriage,"

11:14.730 --> 11:19.189
"LBJ," "Titica,"
"hot dog," or "front lumps"!

11:23.149 --> 11:25.184
I'm not sure Brockman's
out of the woods yet.

11:25.301 --> 11:28.170
There are a lot of religious
watchdog groups out there

11:28.301 --> 11:31.461
keeping the world safe from
the horror of free expression.

11:31.567 --> 11:36.259
You mean there are losers who spend all day
watching TV looking for stuff to complain about?

11:36.462 --> 11:37.897
Who'd be lame enough to do that?

11:38.207 --> 11:42.782
Okay, Smallville...
super dog licks himself.

11:43.054 --> 11:45.264
That definitely goes
in the naughty pile.

11:50.024 --> 11:54.096
60 Minutes... Morley Safer has
questionable pants fold.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.672
The L Word...
Used the "L" word.

12:02.029 --> 12:03.890
And now to peruse
the local news.

12:05.218 --> 12:06.944
The happiness
swept me away.

12:08.722 --> 12:09.381
Oh, that hurt like a...

12:13.254 --> 12:15.716
God's least favorite word
uttered on the public airwaves.

12:16.811 --> 12:19.777
"To: Online Christian Soldiers.

12:19.947 --> 12:23.262
Subject: Televised Super Swear."

12:23.814 --> 12:26.664
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Imploring people I never met

12:26.722 --> 12:29.477
to pressure a government with better
things to do to punish a man who meant

12:29.477 --> 12:32.423
no harm for something nobody even saw.
That's what I'm doing.

12:34.314 --> 12:37.144
- Daddy, we think you need a new mommy.
- First things first.

12:41.225 --> 12:43.871
The Federal Communications
Commission announced today it will launch

12:43.909 --> 12:47.428
a full inquiry into garbage-tongued
anchorman Kent.... Brockman?!

12:47.816 --> 12:51.131
In a related story, Channel Six
will demote Brockman to...

12:51.334 --> 12:54.766
weekend weatherman?!
Dear God, this can't be happening.

13:01.842 --> 13:05.350
It's a glorious day here in Springfield.
Light winds, low humidity.

13:05.971 --> 13:09.082
Now, let's check the five-day forecast.
What the...?!

13:09.257 --> 13:12.514
Even the map thinks
you stink, Kent.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.564
In breaking news,

13:14.604 --> 13:18.888
the FCC has just handed down a record
ten million dollar fine against Channel Six

13:19.000 --> 13:22.353
for Kent Brockman's
shameful swear-nami.

13:22.504 --> 13:26.083
Ten million dollars?! Looks like Newshound,
the Channel Six mascot,

13:26.102 --> 13:28.651
is gonna have to go without
his lazy-eye surgery.

13:30.094 --> 13:31.141
Sorry, boy.

13:31.485 --> 13:33.831
No, I'm over here.
Over here!

13:34.063 --> 13:36.346
I got a treat for you.
Oh!

13:36.521 --> 13:39.254
Now he's gonna starve.
Proud of yourself, Kent?

13:41.857 --> 13:45.055
Kids, your old pal Krusty
has had to make a few cutbacks

13:45.133 --> 13:47.944
because of a huge fine levied
against the station.

13:49.756 --> 13:51.114
That's a bad thing.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.758
Anyway, we can't afford to pay
the voice actors on ltchy and Scratchy,

13:54.982 --> 13:57.289
so I'm doing the voices myself.
Roll it.

13:58.345 --> 14:01.370
I'm a cat walking down
the street, swinging my arms.

14:01.622 --> 14:03.308
Look, a lady made of dynamite!

14:03.735 --> 14:04.782
Wait, I don't know that yet.

14:05.693 --> 14:08.271
How about a smooch?
Kablooey!

14:10.459 --> 14:12.495
Here comes the mouse,
what's-his-name.

14:12.727 --> 14:16.042
That was me that done that.
But it ain't enough, so here's this.

14:16.614 --> 14:20.666
That's what you get for, uh, I don't know,
messing with my wife. And it goes on.

14:25.083 --> 14:28.457
Damn that Brockman!
There are only two rules in TV:

14:28.554 --> 14:32.431
don't swear, and don't whip it out.
It's not rocket science.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.733
- Kent, can we talk?
- I'm not fired, am I?

14:37.840 --> 14:41.077
No, no, this station
stands by its reporters.

14:41.271 --> 14:44.043
Say, what's that powder
in your coffee? Is it cocaine?

14:44.324 --> 14:45.642
No, it's Splenda.

14:45.662 --> 14:48.570
Spare me your slang,
pusher man. You're fired!

15:15.089 --> 15:18.055
Haw, haw!
Your distinguished career is over!

15:30.763 --> 15:32.760
Marge, the couch is lumpy!

15:32.896 --> 15:35.087
That's because you're
sitting on me, you lummox!

15:35.183 --> 15:38.809
- Kent Brockman!
- I invited him to stay with us for a few days.

15:38.915 --> 15:42.269
His career is ruined.
And I was afraid he might commit

15:42.342 --> 15:44.164
you-know-what-icide.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.932
- I'm sorry, Marge, but I won't live
under the same roof

15:46.932 --> 15:49.704
as a member of the liberal media.

15:49.894 --> 15:51.503
You'll have
to excuse him.

15:51.562 --> 15:54.101
He's been watching
a lot of Fox News.

15:54.150 --> 15:57.814
Did you know that every day
Mexican gays sneak into this country

15:57.833 --> 16:00.024
and unplug our brain-dead ladies?

16:01.177 --> 16:02.844
We have to take in
Mr. Brockman.

16:02.922 --> 16:06.247
He wouldn't be in this mess
if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.

16:06.343 --> 16:10.822
Oh, sure, put down a simple guy like me,
who works hard and plays by the rules.

16:11.074 --> 16:14.911
- Dad, you barely go to work at all.
- And you're constantly flouting the law.

16:14.969 --> 16:18.304
I'm willing to change my mind
and that makes me great. You can stay.

16:18.430 --> 16:20.485
But you have to give us
an 8X10 for our wall

16:20.485 --> 16:22.995
of Casual Acquaintances
Who Came to Stay For A While.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.497
Apu sang a song.
What are you gonna do?

16:31.617 --> 16:34.292
Can 15 strippers
run their own airline?

16:35.043 --> 16:38.785
Find out tonight
on Fox's newest reality hit, Landing Strip.

16:39.478 --> 16:43.103
Ladies, check out what I can do
with the oxygen masks.

16:44.741 --> 16:47.843
What a great show.
Real people with real problems.

16:50.191 --> 16:53.564
This is Fox News
with the latest liberal outrage.

16:53.797 --> 16:56.220
It seems liberals want
to give NASA

16:56.259 --> 16:59.613
the right to abort space missions
whenever they feel like it.

16:59.831 --> 17:03.049
Liberals... I hate them so much.

17:03.199 --> 17:04.517
One thing I've always wondered,

17:04.595 --> 17:09.034
how can Fox News be so conservative when
the Fox network keeps airing raunchy shows?

17:09.122 --> 17:10.401
They don't fit together.

17:11.351 --> 17:12.979
Liberals hate families.

17:13.207 --> 17:13.983
Liberals...

17:14.816 --> 17:15.592
Liberals...

17:16.406 --> 17:17.143
Liberals...

17:17.763 --> 17:18.617
Liberals...

17:19.296 --> 17:20.148
Liberals...

17:21.040 --> 17:23.537
Fox deliberately runs shows
that will earn them huge fines

17:23.575 --> 17:26.308
which are then funneled through the FCC
straight to the Republican party.

17:26.309 --> 17:28.829
Everybody in the media knows it,
but no one has the guts to say it.

17:28.916 --> 17:31.766
Not true. You've got the guts,
and I've got a web cam.

17:31.955 --> 17:33.467
This time you can
tell the truth.

17:33.642 --> 17:36.646
And swear like a lumberjack
who hacked off a leg. Let's do it.

17:39.571 --> 17:40.347
Whoo-hoo?

17:40.793 --> 17:41.820
Liberals?

17:42.227 --> 17:43.158
Whoo-hoo?

17:49.048 --> 17:51.859
Here we go.
Four, three, two...

17:53.012 --> 17:55.397
Good evening. Thank you
for inviting me into your laps.

17:56.051 --> 17:59.735
Friends, the press and the government are
in bed together in an embrace so intimate

17:59.822 --> 18:04.242
and wrong, they could spoon on a twin
mattress and still have room for Ted Koppel.

18:04.649 --> 18:07.169
Journalists used to questions
the reasons for war

18:07.411 --> 18:09.137
and expose abuse of power.

18:09.350 --> 18:13.693
Now, like toothless babies, they suckle
on the sugary teat of misinformation

18:13.780 --> 18:16.979
and poop it into the diaper
we call the 6:00 news.

18:17.284 --> 18:19.940
Demand more of your government.
Demand more of your press.

18:19.954 --> 18:23.386
Fellow primate, this
is a wake-up call.

18:27.350 --> 18:31.382
Vote out your so-called representatives.
Reject your corporate masters.

18:31.533 --> 18:34.460
Buy nothing. Hug your children.
Love the one you're with.

18:34.727 --> 18:35.793
Look at that rabble-rouser.

18:36.161 --> 18:38.584
He's threatening
our ill-gotten gains.

18:38.832 --> 18:42.709
Galdarn it!
I worked hard to ill-get those gains.

18:42.917 --> 18:44.235
How do we stop him?

18:44.880 --> 18:46.586
I could Dracula bite him.

18:48.054 --> 18:51.176
Actually, Krusty and I've
been working on a plan to take out Brockman.

18:51.408 --> 18:53.599
- You want to start?
- No, why don't you start?

18:53.672 --> 18:56.424
- Oh, but you're so good at starting.
- You really think so?

18:56.463 --> 18:57.995
- Oh, I know so. Go on.
- All right.

18:58.741 --> 19:01.552
Do you think there's something
going on between those two?

19:01.804 --> 19:05.856
To find out, I could turn myself
into a bat and follow them around.

19:06.074 --> 19:08.478
Oh, you couldn't even get
our pizza orders right.

19:08.555 --> 19:12.142
Every order is half this,
half that, it's confusing!

19:15.997 --> 19:19.729
Kent, your righteous political
commentary rocks.

19:19.807 --> 19:24.246
Yeah, you know how many stars out of five
I gave the YouTube of your webcast?

19:24.377 --> 19:26.820
Five!
And I never give five.

19:26.892 --> 19:28.928
It's true, he never does.

19:29.044 --> 19:32.825
- Mr. Brockman, you're a huge hit.
- Really? How wide is the web?

19:33.067 --> 19:34.366
- World.
- Wow.

19:36.183 --> 19:40.429
Kent, we want to offer you
your old job back with a 50% pay increase.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.623
Lisa, close your eyes
for two seconds.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.341
One, two...

19:50.006 --> 19:51.363
I held out as long as I could!

19:55.249 --> 19:59.437
I guess there's just no place
for truth and bravery in today's media.

19:59.645 --> 20:02.127
True, but there's room for
the truth in this household.

20:03.784 --> 20:07.894
Do you want to hear something really bad
Kent told me about the Fox network?

20:08.064 --> 20:11.049
Of course.
Gosh, Dad, your hands are shaking.

20:11.161 --> 20:14.534
I know. 'Cause this one's
really, really bad.

20:16.308 --> 20:19.332
For years now,
Fox has been...

20:19.366 --> 20:22.390
...programming shows that
the whole family can enjoy.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.768
Oh, my God! You don't suppose
they're gonna start...

20:25.787 --> 20:28.317
...entertaing America
with hits like House,

20:28.419 --> 20:32.083
American Idol and
American Idol Results Show.

20:32.238 --> 20:35.107
I'm afraid they might.
But I will not be silenced.

20:35.665 --> 20:36.595
The truth is...

20:43.288 --> 20:45.964
Okay.
What I was going to say was...

20:46.305 --> 20:52.588
