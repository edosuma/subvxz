00:20.654 --> 00:22.187
>> A tragic ferry accident

00:22.189 --> 00:23.789
today-- apparently a ferry

00:23.791 --> 00:25.491
rammed into the shoreline at

00:25.493 --> 00:27.192
full speed near a local power

00:27.194 --> 00:29.028
plant there.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.362
There are multiple fatalities

00:30.364 --> 00:32.364
and injuries reported at this
hour.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.700
>> DEE: That's really
depressing, and how do you lose

00:34.702 --> 00:36.568
control of a ferry?
They're slow as shit.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.404
>> MAC: Guy must've been drunk.
>> DENNIS: Yeah.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.172
>> FRANK: Hey-yo! Check out my
new threads.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.473
Picked them up at the airport.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.475
>> What were you doing
at the airport?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.477
>> I don't know, just farting
around.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.479
I found this shop full of this
stuff.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.480
Look at that!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.149
I got some for everybody.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.150
>> "Life is happy"?

00:51.152 --> 00:52.484
What the hell is that?

00:52.486 --> 00:53.585
>> Well, it's-it's clothing that

00:53.587 --> 00:54.853
supports a positive message.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.321
I mean, you wear it and you

00:56.323 --> 00:59.558
celebrate that life is happy,
baby.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.393
>> In other news, a man is in

01:01.395 --> 01:02.928
custody for murder of a state

01:02.930 --> 01:04.530
witness who was brutally

01:04.532 --> 01:05.864
beheaded by an assailant

01:05.866 --> 01:07.733
wielding a stop sign.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.734
>> A man seeking justice is

01:08.736 --> 01:10.736
beheaded by a maniac with a stop
sign.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.738
You're right, Frank, life is
happy.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.006
>> The suspect in custody is a

01:14.008 --> 01:15.674
59-year-old repeat felon by the

01:15.676 --> 01:17.242
name of Luther MacDonald.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.911
>> Holy shit-- that's my dad!

01:18.913 --> 01:20.212
>> If convicted, MacDonald could

01:20.214 --> 01:21.880
face the death penalty.

01:21.882 --> 01:22.915
>> Can you believe what they're

01:22.917 --> 01:24.083
saying about my dad having

01:24.085 --> 01:25.184
killed that guy?!

01:25.186 --> 01:26.218
>> Yeah.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.219
>> CHARLIE: Yeah, why-why

01:27.221 --> 01:28.220
wouldn't I believe that?

01:28.222 --> 01:29.221
>> No way.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.222
This has got to be bullshit.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.390
He's innocent, and I'm not gonna

01:31.392 --> 01:32.391
let the State kill him.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.194
I'm gonna save my dad's life.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.785
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

01:59.787 --> 02:01.587
>> Thanks for coming with me,
man.

02:01.589 --> 02:02.588
>> Well, you're forcing me to.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.589
>> Yeah, well...

02:03.591 --> 02:04.590
>> So I'm here.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.591
>> Of course, of course.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.592
We got to show support for my

02:06.594 --> 02:07.593
dad, right?

02:07.595 --> 02:08.594
We got to let him know that we

02:08.596 --> 02:09.595
know he didn't do it.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.596
>> I know, but I believe that he

02:10.598 --> 02:11.597
did, so...

02:11.599 --> 02:12.598
>> Well, are you gonna be cool?

02:12.600 --> 02:13.599
>> I'll be cool, you know, as

02:13.601 --> 02:14.600
long as he doesn't ask us to

02:14.602 --> 02:15.601
shove heroin up our ass again,

02:15.603 --> 02:16.602
I'll-I'll be cool.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.603
>> He might and I might do it.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.604
>> Well, you would enjoy it more

02:18.606 --> 02:19.605
than I would.

02:19.607 --> 02:20.606
Uh, here he comes.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.607
>> Oh, here he comes.

02:21.609 --> 02:22.975
Oh, Dad! He looks great, huh?

02:22.977 --> 02:24.943
Dad! Da-Dad! Hey! How are you?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.845
It's been so long! Look!

02:26.847 --> 02:27.913
I-I brought a picture of Mom

02:27.915 --> 02:29.681
here just to make you feel more

02:29.683 --> 02:30.983
at home.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.451
She looks good, right?

02:32.453 --> 02:35.120
And, uh, me-- what about me?

02:35.122 --> 02:36.121
How do I look? Do I look cool?

02:36.123 --> 02:37.122
>> Give it a rest.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.190
>> Do I look cool?

02:38.192 --> 02:39.324
>> What do you want?

02:39.326 --> 02:40.659
>> Uh, we-we just wanted to come

02:40.661 --> 02:41.994
by and tell you that we believe

02:41.996 --> 02:43.362
that there is no way that you

02:43.364 --> 02:46.331
did this.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.935
You didn't do it, right, Dad?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.370
>> No.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.372
>> Right. I knew it! I knew it!

02:53.374 --> 02:54.773
Another innocent man being

02:54.775 --> 02:56.141
railroaded by the system!

02:56.143 --> 02:57.342
Besides, there's no way that you

02:57.344 --> 02:58.343
could've done this.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.344
You have a bad shoulder and

02:59.346 --> 03:00.445
that's why you could never have

03:00.447 --> 03:01.880
a catch with me, remember?

03:01.882 --> 03:03.615
>> Right.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.816
>> Yeah, yeah.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.817
Well, Charlie and I just want to

03:05.819 --> 03:07.152
let you know that we will not

03:07.154 --> 03:09.688
rest until you are proven
innocent.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.790
>> Look, I got a lawyer

03:11.792 --> 03:12.958
appointed to me.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.359
It'll be fine.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.460
>> No, uh, uh, sorry, uh, Mr.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.862
Mac, uh, you really don't want

03:16.864 --> 03:17.863
to put your life in the hands of

03:17.865 --> 03:18.864
a public defender.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.866
I mean, those guys are absolute
clowns.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.900
I tell you what-- I'd be

03:21.902 --> 03:23.035
interested to take a look at

03:23.037 --> 03:24.469
your case, you know, if-if you

03:24.471 --> 03:25.671
want a little outside help.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.406
I specialize in bird law mostly,

03:27.408 --> 03:28.407
but I know my way...

03:28.409 --> 03:30.242
>> Stay out of this!

03:30.244 --> 03:32.177
Both of you!

03:32.179 --> 03:35.547
I do not want you stirring

03:35.549 --> 03:37.983
things up!

03:37.985 --> 03:39.651
You hear me?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.154
>> Yeah, I-I-I-I-I hear you,
Dad.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.989
Um, one last thing, though.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.191
I love you and I...

03:46.193 --> 03:47.559
Oh, I love you!

03:47.561 --> 03:48.560
I love you, Dad!

03:48.562 --> 03:49.561
I love you!

03:49.563 --> 03:51.563
He can't hear me because of
this...

03:51.565 --> 03:52.564
>> Uh, he definitely heard you.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.565
>> And the glass is too thick.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.700
I think there's something...

03:54.702 --> 03:55.701
something wrong with that.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.702
>> Yeah.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.770
>> Uh, all right.

03:58.772 --> 03:59.905
>> We're now being told the

03:59.907 --> 04:01.340
ferry captain was intentionally

04:01.342 --> 04:03.075
trying to steer the ferry into

04:03.077 --> 04:04.876
the nearby power plant.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.212
The captain has tested negative

04:07.214 --> 04:08.714
for alcohol and drugs.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.182
>> The guy wasn't even drunk!

04:10.184 --> 04:11.350
This was a sober man purposely

04:11.352 --> 04:13.385
steering a ship into a power
plant.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.386
>> Oh, God, the world is a very

04:14.388 --> 04:15.721
depressing place.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.222
>> You guys are depressing.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.457
I'm trying to enjoy my cone

04:18.459 --> 04:19.558
over here.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.592
Turn that crap off!

04:20.594 --> 04:21.593
(door opens)

04:21.595 --> 04:22.894
>> Yeah, baby!

04:22.896 --> 04:25.230
There they are! The usual
suspects!

04:25.232 --> 04:27.699
>> Pondy! Just the man I want to
see!

04:27.701 --> 04:29.468
Now, this man loves life!

04:29.470 --> 04:31.536
>> I'd love to get into some
shots.

04:31.538 --> 04:32.537
Line them up, Frankie!

04:32.539 --> 04:33.705
Line them up!

04:33.707 --> 04:34.706
>> Now we got some positive

04:34.708 --> 04:35.974
vibes in here.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.976
>> You are his AA sponsor,
right?

04:37.978 --> 04:40.279
>> Never change, Dee.
I love it! Come on!

04:40.281 --> 04:42.447
Do a shot with me.
Come on-- shot, shot, shot!

04:42.449 --> 04:44.616
>> I gotta say I feel like a
shot might make me feel better.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.485
>> I think I need to do a shot
at this point.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.320
>> All right, to the brim.
>> Let's go, Frank, all right.

04:48.322 --> 04:49.421
Yeah, you're looking pretty

04:49.423 --> 04:50.422
dapper there, Bill-- you hittin'

04:50.424 --> 04:51.423
it hard, or what?

04:51.425 --> 04:52.924
>> I'm celebrating today, baby.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.259
>> What's the special occasion?

04:54.261 --> 04:58.263
>> I'm gonna kill myself.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.298
>> What?

04:59.300 --> 05:00.632
>> Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna drink

05:00.634 --> 05:01.933
myself to death.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.435
Yeah, I botched it.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.736
Life, you know?

05:04.738 --> 05:05.937
Old B.P. had a good run, though,

05:05.939 --> 05:07.139
you know?

05:07.141 --> 05:08.340
It's like there's this tiny

05:08.342 --> 05:09.508
little soul man in my body

05:09.510 --> 05:10.742
driving me around.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.110
That little soul man's ready to

05:12.112 --> 05:13.512
power old Bill down and move on

05:13.514 --> 05:15.814
to the next party monster.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.150
Aw, come on, you guys own a bar,
right?

05:18.152 --> 05:19.151
You watch people slowly kill

05:19.153 --> 05:20.152
themselves every day, am I

05:20.154 --> 05:23.255
right? (laughs, coughs)

05:23.257 --> 05:25.157
Keep it open.

05:25.159 --> 05:28.260
♪ ♪

05:28.262 --> 05:30.262
>> Charlie, this is a huge waste
of time.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.430
>> No, no, no, no, this is

05:31.432 --> 05:32.431
standard procedure.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.099
They do this on every crime
show.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.100
You know, the murder police come

05:35.102 --> 05:36.134
down to the scene of the crime

05:36.136 --> 05:37.135
and they find some blue-collar

05:37.137 --> 05:38.136
guy and they talk to him while

05:38.138 --> 05:39.137
he's working.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.138
Let's just talk to this guy over

05:40.140 --> 05:41.606
here-- he could know something,
right?

05:41.608 --> 05:43.141
>> Why would he know anything?

05:43.143 --> 05:45.143
>> He's moving crates from one
place to...

05:45.145 --> 05:46.778
Will you just listen to me?
All right?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.380
Excuse me, sir, uh, do you work
here?

05:48.382 --> 05:49.381
>> Yeah.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.449
>> Please, don't stop your work.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.450
They never do on TV.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.051
Go ahead and place that bag
down.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.953
Uh, now, are you familiar with

05:54.955 --> 05:55.954
the beheading that took place

05:55.956 --> 05:56.955
here last week?

05:56.957 --> 05:57.956
>> Are you a cop?

05:57.958 --> 05:59.458
>> No. But, uh, I do work on the

05:59.460 --> 06:00.892
behalf of the accused.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.893
I'm taking care of his interests

06:01.895 --> 06:02.894
and whatnot.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.830
This is his son, uh, Ronald.

06:04.832 --> 06:05.897
>> You're Luther's kid?

06:05.899 --> 06:06.898
>> Yeah. That's right, bozo.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.899
And I'm willing to do whatever

06:07.901 --> 06:08.967
it takes to make sure he doesn't

06:08.969 --> 06:10.068
get the death penalty, all
right?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.470
>> Is that a threat?

06:11.472 --> 06:12.971
>> Why don't you tell us what
you saw.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.039
>> I didn't see either of those
guys, okay?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.707
>> There was more than one guy?

06:15.709 --> 06:17.509
>> I said too much.
I don't want any trouble, okay?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.144
>> Well, then stop giving us
trouble, and tell us if there

06:19.146 --> 06:20.812
was another guy.
>> My lips are sealed, guys.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.314
>> Then unseal them, or I'll
unseal them for you!

06:22.316 --> 06:23.682
>> Hey, hey, hey, what the hell
are you doing?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.083
You can't threaten this guy.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.718
Threaten? I wasn't threatening
him.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.387
>> How do you not know what a
threat sounds like?

06:28.389 --> 06:30.021
>> Oh, you mean the "lips"
thing?

06:30.023 --> 06:31.022
>> Yes, the "lips" thing.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.023
>> Charlie, he's got words in

06:32.025 --> 06:33.658
his lips-- I needed to get them
out.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.394
>> I know the words are in his
lips-- I saw them in there.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.095
Just let me... you know, let me
coax them out.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.830
Otherwise, you're gonna freak
the guy out, all right?

06:38.832 --> 06:39.865
Just let me handle it, okay?

06:39.867 --> 06:42.434
Sir, your lips are fine. I...

06:42.436 --> 06:43.702
Great.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.704
That happens to us way too much.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.673
>> Yeah.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.509
>> I mean, I don't really care
<i> that</i> much about Bill, I just

06:50.511 --> 06:52.077
don't want him dying in the bar.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.678
We've had too many deaths in
there already.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.280
>> We should probably try not to
have another one.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.848
>> We got to show Pondy life is

06:56.850 --> 06:57.849
worth living.

06:57.851 --> 06:58.850
>> Right. I'm not real excited

06:58.852 --> 06:59.851
about Maureen being a part of

06:59.853 --> 07:02.220
this, but yeah, we'll do it.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.855
Ah.
W...

07:03.857 --> 07:04.856
>> Hello, Dennis.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.458
>> Oh, God. Maureen, what's

07:06.460 --> 07:07.459
going on with your face?

07:07.461 --> 07:08.894
What have you done?

07:08.896 --> 07:09.961
>> I've had a few surgical

07:09.963 --> 07:12.798
procedures to enhance my natural
beauty.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.032
>> You look like a cat.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.233
>> Yes, exactly.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.435
Cats are beautiful.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.602
>> Where are your breasts?

07:17.604 --> 07:18.804
>> Oh, they're in my face.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.138
>> Great. Um, I don't really

07:20.140 --> 07:21.540
have time for this shit, so,

07:21.542 --> 07:22.741
have you gathered Bill's family

07:22.743 --> 07:23.942
for us?

07:23.944 --> 07:26.278
>> (meowing): Me-yes.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.151
>> You kids remember Uncle
Dennis?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.053
He came to talk to us about
something important.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.721
Go ahead, baby.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.491
>> Yeah. Uh... >> Are you two
getting back together?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.493
>> Oh, no.
>> I think so.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.829
>> Uh, no, never.
>> Uh, uh, okay.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.898
Um, listen, you guys, your dad--
he needs your help right now.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.134
He's in a pretty tough spot.
>> I don't call him "Dad."

07:49.136 --> 07:51.336
I call him Mr. ... Sucker,
'cause he sucks so many ...

07:51.338 --> 07:52.504
>> Weird.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.738
Uh, I'm not going to call him

07:53.740 --> 07:54.940
that, okay?

07:54.942 --> 07:56.274
I'll just refer to him as

07:56.276 --> 07:57.409
"Bill," I guess from now...

07:57.411 --> 07:58.777
>> Yeah.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.979
>> Okay, so, listen, here's the
thing.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.980
He is at our bar right now

08:01.982 --> 08:02.981
drinking himself to death.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.982
>> Oh, that's fantastic.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.184
>> What? No, that's not
fantastic.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.786
The man's trying to kill
himself.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.421
>> If he dies, we get money.

08:09.423 --> 08:11.423
>> When I get my money, I want
to buy a new cell phone.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.592
>> I'm gonna a gun, because I'm
the man of the house.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.594
>> Oh, shit, no.
This kid should not have a...

08:15.596 --> 08:17.929
>> No.
>> No, no. Please.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.764
We're trying to show Bill that
life is worth living.

08:19.766 --> 08:20.932
>> Your dad loves you.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.934
>> No, he doesn't.
>> Oh.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.036
>> Yeah.
>> Has he not said it? Because

08:25.038 --> 08:26.972
I'm telling you, he just...
>> He does.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.174
>> No. He told me. He said, "I
do not love you. You're a punk."

08:29.176 --> 08:30.208
>> He called me too fat to be a

08:30.210 --> 08:31.209
slut, and tried to serve me an

08:31.211 --> 08:32.277
omelet with cocaine in it.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.278
>> Listen, guys, this is about

08:33.280 --> 08:34.279
forgiving Bill, your dad, okay?

08:34.281 --> 08:35.280
It's not about blaming him.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.448
>> No.

08:36.450 --> 08:37.449
>> Oh, I blame you, too.

08:37.451 --> 08:38.450
You and the other hookers he

08:38.452 --> 08:39.651
slept with.

08:39.653 --> 08:40.652
>> Hold on a second. I'm not...

08:40.654 --> 08:41.653
I'm not a hooker.

08:41.655 --> 08:42.854
I never have been.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.055
>> Nah.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.290
>> You're a hooker.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.291
>> You're a fat slut!

08:46.293 --> 08:47.459
(screaming)

08:47.461 --> 08:48.460
>> Oh, oh. Oh, okay, all...

08:48.462 --> 08:49.461
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:49.463 --> 08:50.462
>> And you... you ruined his

08:50.464 --> 08:51.463
sister with the divorce, and

08:51.465 --> 08:52.664
look at her face.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.665
She looks like a cat.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.666
>> Cats are magical.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.667
>> I kind of like...

08:55.669 --> 08:56.668
I mean, maybe you could get some

08:56.670 --> 08:57.869
fur. Yeah.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.870
>> Oh, I like that idea.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.871
>> What are you talking? No!

08:59.873 --> 09:02.073
>> Do you think you could do a
tail?

09:02.075 --> 09:04.309
>> I don't see why I couldn't do
a tail.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.311
>> Don't-don't... No.
>> Yeah. You could go full cat

09:06.313 --> 09:08.480
and start wearing humans on your
sweatshirt.

09:08.482 --> 09:09.481
>> No one is turning themselves

09:09.483 --> 09:10.482
into a goddamn cat with my

09:10.484 --> 09:11.483
money! Can we focus here?

09:11.485 --> 09:12.551
Let-Let's... let's get back to

09:12.553 --> 09:13.752
showing Bill that life is happy.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.387
>> Bill's a lying, cheating,

09:15.389 --> 09:16.555
drug-addict piece of garbage,

09:16.557 --> 09:18.490
and we all hope he dies.

09:18.492 --> 09:22.127
>> Yeah.

09:24.431 --> 09:28.033
(buzzer sounds, door opens)

09:28.035 --> 09:30.669
>> Hey, Dad, hey, um, so, I-I

09:30.671 --> 09:32.170
know you told us to stay out of

09:32.172 --> 09:34.839
it, but, but we found out that

09:34.841 --> 09:36.041
there was another guy.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.242
Also, we got a stop sign and

09:37.244 --> 09:38.443
recreated the murder, and there

09:38.445 --> 09:39.611
was no way that you could have

09:39.613 --> 09:40.845
swung that.

09:40.847 --> 09:41.846
Actually, I kind of jacked my

09:41.848 --> 09:43.081
shoulder up a little bit, too.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.017
>> Do you realize what you've
done?

09:46.019 --> 09:48.587
>> No. Yeah. No. I told him, Mr.
Mac.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.589
I said, "Hey, stealing a stop
sign-- that's a felony," and as

09:50.591 --> 09:52.791
your counsel, I did advise
against it.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.759
>> I'm talking about you going

09:54.761 --> 09:56.194
to the crime scene.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.097
Word's out my son is

09:59.099 --> 10:00.865
intimidating witnesses.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.768
Now, that makes me look like I'm
guilty.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.970
>> Oh.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.137
>> Oh, yeah.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.405
>> Your dad'd be a good lawyer.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.573
>> His idea.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.574
But, look, the point is, we

10:09.576 --> 10:11.776
found out that this other guy
exists.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.777
All we need to do is get his

10:12.779 --> 10:14.079
name, and then I can rat on him.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.715
>> Do not be a rat!

10:16.717 --> 10:21.319
Stop... trying... to handle it,

10:21.321 --> 10:24.055
or I... am going to have to

10:24.057 --> 10:28.226
handle<i> you,</i> okay?

10:28.228 --> 10:31.229
>> Okay, Daddy.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.430
Oh.

10:32.432 --> 10:33.598
I love you, Dad.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.799
>> Oh, let it go. Let it go.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.235
>> Oh... it's just I thought
maybe...

10:37.237 --> 10:38.436
>> Yeah.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.604
>> It's not broken.

10:39.606 --> 10:40.805
>> No. Yeah, it's working fine,

10:40.807 --> 10:41.806
isn't it?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.008
>> No, it works.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.009
He seemed a little... he seemed

10:44.011 --> 10:45.243
a little upset.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.244
>> All right... plan "B" here.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.445
>> I got an idea.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.446
Why don't we check the guest

10:48.448 --> 10:49.614
record, right, because maybe

10:49.616 --> 10:50.615
that guy came to visit my dad?

10:50.617 --> 10:51.816
>> Oh, the other guy signed in?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.018
>> Yes.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.252
>> And, uh, that's a good point.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.453
>> Luther MacDonald visited

10:55.455 --> 10:56.621
by... Bonnie Kelly?

10:56.623 --> 10:57.822
Holy shit!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.024
>> Well, that's the same name as

10:59.026 --> 11:00.692
my mom.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.926
>> It<i> is</i> your mom.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.128
>> Nah. I'm sure there's plenty

11:03.130 --> 11:04.329
of Bonnie Kellys.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.530
You know, they probably all sign

11:05.532 --> 11:06.698
their name with those weird,

11:06.700 --> 11:07.932
squiggly lines, and...

11:07.934 --> 11:09.134
>> Cursive? Are-are you talking

11:09.136 --> 11:10.602
about cursive, dude?

11:10.604 --> 11:12.037
>> Uh... cursing?

11:12.039 --> 11:14.472
>> Cursive. Everybody can
under...

11:14.474 --> 11:15.640
Okay, look, doesn't matter.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.941
We have to figure out why she

11:16.943 --> 11:18.143
came to visit my dad.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.344
>> And why is she signing my

11:19.346 --> 11:20.545
mom's name?

11:20.547 --> 11:23.348
>> Goddamn it, goddamn it.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.051
>> Hey!

11:26.053 --> 11:28.486
>> Bill, we want to talk to you.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.654
>> Hey, you guys see this?

11:29.656 --> 11:30.655
It was another ferry that ran

11:30.657 --> 11:31.856
into the power plant.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.058
Copycat crime.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.292
(Bill laughs)

11:34.294 --> 11:35.493
Hilarious, right?

11:35.495 --> 11:36.528
>> No!

11:36.530 --> 11:37.629
>> No. There are black and white

11:37.631 --> 11:38.630
areas in life, Bill, and that's

11:38.632 --> 11:39.631
a... that's a black area.

11:39.633 --> 11:40.632
>> Uh, look, turn it off.

11:40.634 --> 11:41.633
We want to focus on the positive

11:41.635 --> 11:42.634
in life now, Pondy.

11:42.636 --> 11:43.635
>> Yeah, yeah, which is why

11:43.637 --> 11:44.636
we're all wearing these

11:44.638 --> 11:45.837
ill-fitting T-shirts.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.038
>> Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.239
>> Right.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.240
>> Okay, we want to show you

11:49.242 --> 11:51.409
some reasons why life is worth
living.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.645
>> Yeah.
>> And, Dennis, you're up.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.847
>> Okay, so, uh, I like a good
mani-pedi.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.048
>> Uh.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.049
>> Yeah, I like... I like a

11:58.051 --> 11:59.050
good, healthy nail. I love one.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.051
You know, you get your... you

12:00.053 --> 12:01.052
get your nail beds clean, you

12:01.054 --> 12:03.254
get your cuticles pushed back,
right?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.090
>> Yeah.
>> Oh, yeah. That's great.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.392
>> You get your hangnails all
trimmed up... by one of those

12:07.394 --> 12:08.393
nice ladies over there.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.394
>> You know, a lot of those are

12:09.396 --> 12:10.595
sex workers.

12:10.597 --> 12:11.596
Yeah, the gals at the nail salon

12:11.598 --> 12:13.765
there-- yeah, they're
prostitutes.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.766
They're trafficked in.

12:14.768 --> 12:15.767
Usually in shipping containers.

12:15.769 --> 12:16.768
I mean, they're, like, crammed

12:16.770 --> 12:17.769
in there, you know, like-like

12:17.771 --> 12:20.205
sardines, shipped with sardines
sometimes.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.406
>> Oh.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.407
>> It's ugly, but the point is,

12:22.409 --> 12:23.608
those ladies doing your nails

12:23.610 --> 12:24.776
probably tugged a guy off right

12:24.778 --> 12:26.010
before you.

12:26.012 --> 12:29.614
>> They ship 'em in in shipping
containers?

12:29.616 --> 12:30.782
That's depressing as hell.

12:30.784 --> 12:31.950
>> Uh, uh...

12:31.952 --> 12:33.184
>> Goddamn!

12:33.186 --> 12:34.385
>> All right, Dee?

12:34.387 --> 12:35.587
>> Me?

12:35.589 --> 12:36.588
>> You, you're up, yeah. Yeah.

12:36.590 --> 12:37.589
>> Yeah. Hey, Bill, you know,

12:37.591 --> 12:38.590
for me, uh, really it's just the

12:38.592 --> 12:39.591
simple things that I like in my

12:39.593 --> 12:40.759
life, like a moonlight walk or

12:40.761 --> 12:43.194
a-a cozy, warm nap.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.395
Or a delicious, ripe piece of

12:44.397 --> 12:45.597
fruit, you know?

12:45.599 --> 12:46.765
>> Oh.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.966
>> Mmm.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.200
>> The, uh, sex workers use

12:49.202 --> 12:50.401
fruit during the act.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.603
>> What?

12:51.605 --> 12:52.771
>> Yeah. Yeah, well, the citrus

12:52.773 --> 12:56.374
masks the taste of a dirty
penis.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.575
(sniffles)

12:57.577 --> 12:58.743
In fact, 95% of fruit has

12:58.745 --> 12:59.944
usually been in someone's

12:59.946 --> 13:01.146
orifice before it even reaches

13:01.148 --> 13:02.380
the market.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.581
>> Okay. Okay, I'm done.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.950
He's ruined fruit for me, so I'm
done.

13:05.952 --> 13:06.985
>> You've made fruit depressing.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.153
>> All right, well, I got this.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.387
Okay, all right, what makes me

13:09.389 --> 13:11.890
happy is, like, you know, at

13:11.892 --> 13:13.057
night, a ride around town in a

13:13.059 --> 13:14.259
limousine, partying, having a

13:14.261 --> 13:15.460
good time.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.228
When I'm on my way home, I'll

13:17.230 --> 13:18.429
pass a bum.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.631
I take a balloon with some

13:19.633 --> 13:20.799
champagne in it, lob it out and

13:20.801 --> 13:22.000
bean him.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.435
He only gets a little bit in his
mouth.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.271
He doesn't get the whole thing.
>> Right.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.740
>> Not even a full sip of it.
And you say, "Hey, how do you

13:28.742 --> 13:31.009
like a taste of the good life,
you sack of shit?"

13:31.011 --> 13:33.912
(Bill and Frank laugh)

13:33.914 --> 13:34.979
>> Hey, that's a...

13:34.981 --> 13:36.014
>> God, that is awful!

13:36.016 --> 13:37.115
That is a horrible thing to do

13:37.117 --> 13:38.116
to another human being!

13:38.118 --> 13:39.517
>> Goddamn you!

13:39.519 --> 13:41.519
Hey, get over here, Frank.
Get over here.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.788
>> Well...
>> Okay, that's it, I'm done.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.957
All right, this is depressing
as shit.

13:45.959 --> 13:46.958
I'm not doing this anymore.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.959
In fact, I'm starting to think

13:47.961 --> 13:48.960
that his family was right.

13:48.962 --> 13:49.961
You guys, what if we took out a

13:49.963 --> 13:52.163
life insurance policy on the
guy?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.164
I mean, if he's gonna do it

13:53.166 --> 13:54.165
anyway, we might as well make a

13:54.167 --> 13:55.166
little money off of it.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.368
>> Hmm, that's dark.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.369
>> Yeah, I know.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.370
>> But can you take a life

13:59.372 --> 14:00.371
insurance policy out on anybody?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.372
Does it work that way?

14:01.374 --> 14:02.373
>> Mm, it's a gray area, but I

14:02.375 --> 14:03.374
think I got a guy, I could twist

14:03.376 --> 14:04.375
his arm, we could get one.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.376
>> Okay, I say we embrace the

14:05.378 --> 14:06.544
gray area of life, okay, because

14:06.546 --> 14:09.714
what we're doing is not working.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.715
What, the State can murder

14:10.717 --> 14:11.716
somebody without them even

14:11.718 --> 14:12.717
wanting to die but a grown man

14:12.719 --> 14:14.719
can't kill himself if he wants
to?

14:14.721 --> 14:15.720
>> A man should be able to end

14:15.722 --> 14:16.721
his life if he wants...

14:16.723 --> 14:17.822
>> He's a grown American man.

14:17.824 --> 14:18.823
>> We're American.

14:18.825 --> 14:19.824
>> Aw, to hell with him.

14:19.826 --> 14:20.825
We tried. I give up.

14:20.827 --> 14:21.826
>> Great, Frank.

14:21.828 --> 14:22.827
Glad you're on our side.

14:22.829 --> 14:23.828
You're a terrible sponsor, by

14:23.830 --> 14:24.829
the way.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.831
>> Yeah.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.703
>> Okay, so why were you

14:31.705 --> 14:33.037
visiting Luther, Mom?

14:33.039 --> 14:34.572
>> I went to go...

14:34.574 --> 14:36.674
>> She don't know nothin' about
nothin'.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.675
>> Look, we know there was

14:37.677 --> 14:39.677
another guy in on this, all
right?

14:39.679 --> 14:40.678
So, come on, anything you can

14:40.680 --> 14:41.679
give us.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.348
>> He was staying here for a few
months.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.749
>> He was here for a few months?

14:44.751 --> 14:46.751
Mom, why wouldn't you tell me
that?

14:46.753 --> 14:47.752
>> Mm.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.754
>> Okay, well-well, was he here

14:49.756 --> 14:51.089
on the night of the murder?

14:51.091 --> 14:53.324
>> Uh, no.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.926
>> Mom, don't lie, okay?

14:54.928 --> 14:55.927
>> Okay, yes.

14:55.929 --> 14:56.928
>> Quiet, Bonnie.

14:56.930 --> 14:57.929
>> No, no.

14:57.931 --> 14:58.930
>> Mom, if you know something,

14:58.932 --> 14:59.931
you got to tell me.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.933
>> I can't lie to my Charlie.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.268
>> Good! Tell me everything.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.536
>> Okay. They were both here.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.872
They were both inside me.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.607
Eduardo was in my mouth, and

15:09.609 --> 15:10.842
Luther was in my butt.

15:10.844 --> 15:12.877
>> Oh, my God, no, don't tell me
everything.

15:12.879 --> 15:13.878
What? No! What?!

15:13.880 --> 15:14.879
>> Damn it, Bonnie.

15:14.881 --> 15:15.880
>> Eduardo who?

15:15.882 --> 15:16.881
>> Sanchez.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.549
>> Holy shit. Tell us more.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.585
>> Then Luther went in Eduardo's

15:20.587 --> 15:22.553
butt for a while.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.055
>> Tell us less. Tell us less.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.723
>> Then they both "completed" on

15:25.725 --> 15:26.925
each other.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.726
I-I was left out of the finale.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.396
And then Eduardo went out and

15:31.398 --> 15:33.197
then he killed somebody and

15:33.199 --> 15:36.734
then... th... Well, that's all I
know.

15:36.736 --> 15:40.138
>> Jesus goddamn Christ, Mom.
If you know that, just say that.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.440
Don't tell me the whole thing
about banging every single guy

15:42.442 --> 15:44.442
that comes in the house.
If you just know about-about the

15:44.444 --> 15:46.544
murder, just say the murder
part! Oh, my God!

15:46.546 --> 15:48.546
>> Oh, my God, this is crazy.
You guys know what this means?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.448
That my father was trying to
establish dominance, and that's

15:50.450 --> 15:52.083
the only reason he was in his
butt or...

15:52.085 --> 15:53.718
>> What are you tal... Why are
you focused on that?

15:53.720 --> 15:54.819
>> Well, it's about power.
>> We have our guy now.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.321
>> I feel like we should make

15:56.323 --> 15:57.956
that known, that it's
about power, okay?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.490
>> Let's not make any of it
known.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.491
>> We got to go to the police.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.759
>> Don't be a rat.

16:01.761 --> 16:02.760
>> All right, look, Mrs. Mac,

16:02.762 --> 16:03.761
we're not gonna rat, all right?

16:03.763 --> 16:04.762
We're gonna figure something

16:04.764 --> 16:05.763
else out.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.764
Good?

16:06.766 --> 16:07.765
>> Mm.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.234
>> Okay, you're off words again.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.235
Great. Uh, and, Mom, don't bang

16:11.237 --> 16:13.237
every guy that comes into the
house.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.238
How 'bout that?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.506
>> Okay, I won't, sweetie.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.575
>> Okay.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.749
>> It is my gift to you. >> This
is... this is great. Thank you.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.850
>> Guys, guys, guys, we've had a

16:25.852 --> 16:27.852
major break in my dad's case.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.021
What's Ponderosa doing here?
>> Oh, he's, uh, gonna drink

16:30.023 --> 16:32.690
himself to death, so we took out
a life insurance policy on him.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.492
>> Oh, cool, yeah.
Pretty dark, though, right?

16:34.494 --> 16:36.527
>> We've been over this.
We've justified this already.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.097
>> Don't worry about it. We're
okay with it. >> Fair enough.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.299
Uh, turns out that Mac's dad
didn't kill the guy.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.301
No, there was another man in on
this.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.369
>> Yeah, it's gonna look really

16:44.371 --> 16:45.803
bad if I rat on this man Eduardo

16:45.805 --> 16:47.805
Sanchez, so I can't say his
name.

16:47.807 --> 16:50.008
>> Uh... >> You just did.
You just ratted him out.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.143
>> You said his name.
By the way, another guy being

16:52.145 --> 16:54.145
there doesn't mean that your dad
didn't do it.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.513
He might've done it with the
other guy.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.781
>> Oh, no, uh, my dad

16:56.783 --> 16:57.849
established dominance over this
man.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.350
>> All right, well, let's not...

16:59.352 --> 17:00.952
>> Oh, what-what does that mean?
>> What's this?

17:00.954 --> 17:02.387
>> Uh, there's some weird prison
sex going on.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.955
>> He may or may not have been a
power bottom.

17:03.957 --> 17:05.189
>> The bottom line is he talked

17:05.191 --> 17:06.824
his lover into doing the murder
for him.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.726
>> Not his lover, his prison
bitch.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.661
>> Hey, what if I confess? Hmm?

17:10.663 --> 17:11.662
>> What?

17:11.664 --> 17:12.964
>> Yeah, I could take my own

17:12.966 --> 17:14.198
life while saving your dad's.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.666
Everybody wins.

17:15.668 --> 17:16.868
>> Well, yeah, except everyone

17:16.870 --> 17:18.302
would think that you decapitated

17:18.304 --> 17:19.871
a man with a stop sign.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.072
>> Ooh, even better.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.341
Oh, that'll really embarrass the
wife.

17:23.343 --> 17:24.642
>> Okay, I like where this is

17:24.644 --> 17:25.643
going, but I got to bring

17:25.645 --> 17:26.644
something up here.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.546
Um, if you were to do that-- and

17:28.548 --> 17:29.547
I don't want to be crass or, you

17:29.549 --> 17:30.848
know-- but how would that

17:30.850 --> 17:31.849
affect, uh, the...

17:31.851 --> 17:32.850
>> Oh, we still get the money.

17:32.852 --> 17:33.851
>> Yeah?

17:33.853 --> 17:34.852
>> I bought the most expensive

17:34.854 --> 17:35.853
policy I could.

17:35.855 --> 17:36.854
>> Great.

17:36.856 --> 17:37.922
>> Let's go confess, baby!

17:37.924 --> 17:40.691
>> Yeah.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.060
>> I can't... I'm sorry.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.327
I just... I don't get how it's

17:43.329 --> 17:44.529
dominant if they finished on

17:44.531 --> 17:45.730
each other.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.265
How is that dominant?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.433
>> It's dominant because he

17:48.435 --> 17:49.434
finished first.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.103
Then he allowed Eduardo to
finish.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.237
>> No, you're making that up.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.272
You don't know that.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.273
>> Oh, oh, there's Bill.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.108
>> Oh, hey.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.010
>> Well, I did it. I confessed.

17:59.012 --> 18:01.245
>> Why aren't you in handcuffs
then?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.613
>> Weirdest thing, I'm sitting

18:02.615 --> 18:04.015
in the interrogation room, you

18:04.017 --> 18:05.783
know, sobering up a little bit,

18:05.785 --> 18:07.051
looking at myself in the two-way

18:07.053 --> 18:09.120
mirror and I kept reading this
shirt.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.955
Yeah. Yeah, I started thinking,

18:10.957 --> 18:13.091
"You know what, life<i> is</i> happy.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.759
I want to live!"

18:14.761 --> 18:15.760
>> Well, then what did you

18:15.762 --> 18:16.761
confess about?

18:16.763 --> 18:17.862
>> Eduardo Sanchez.

18:17.864 --> 18:18.863
That guy you were talking about?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.098
Turns out he's some big gang

18:20.100 --> 18:21.132
member that they've been after

18:21.134 --> 18:22.133
for years.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.469
Yeah, your dad's innocent.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.238
>> Holy shit, my dad's gonna get
off.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.407
That means I'm a hero!

18:29.409 --> 18:31.309
I did it!

18:31.311 --> 18:33.578
Dad, Dad, we did it.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.579
>> We did it.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.580
>> Yeah, we did it!

18:35.582 --> 18:36.581
They're gonna nail this Eduardo

18:36.583 --> 18:37.582
Sanchez guy and you're gonna

18:37.584 --> 18:38.816
walk free.

18:38.818 --> 18:39.817
I saved you.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.818
>> Saved me?

18:40.820 --> 18:41.819
>> Yeah.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.821
>> You buried me.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.456
Now everyone in here thinks I'm

18:45.458 --> 18:46.791
a rat.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.093
They're gonna kill me in here.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.929
Because of you.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.898
>> I'm-I'm sorry.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.400
I still love you.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.604
>> I don't.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.005
(door buzzes)

19:01.007 --> 19:02.406
>> He definitely heard you.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.343
You know, he can... he can hear
you.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.312
>> He didn't mean that, though.
He was just upset.

19:44.450 --> 19:47.518
(trio chanting backwards)
