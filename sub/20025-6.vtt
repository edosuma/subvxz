WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.878
Six years ago, the Geordie Squad
first got together.

00:13.246 --> 00:15.348
(cheering)

00:15.415 --> 00:17.283
But it's not all been one big party.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.285
Back to work.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.055
We've had to work
for that wrinkly fuck Anna.

00:23.323 --> 00:26.359
But we fucking nailed it.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.428
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:30.864 --> 00:33.833
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:35.034 --> 00:38.238
So, now the squad is expanding.

00:38.304 --> 00:41.441
Oi, oi!
Hello! Hiya!

00:41.508 --> 00:43.710
Cheers!
(cheering)

00:49.048 --> 00:52.886
I'm not gonna be able to
keep all yous all on full time.

00:52.952 --> 00:57.624
We need to help Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.162
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.228 --> 01:04.931
Are they fucking radge enough...

01:04.998 --> 01:07.734
To join this crazy family?

01:13.773 --> 01:15.408
Let wuh fuckin gan.

01:16.009 --> 01:20.647
So far, Anna's sent in
Abbie, Eve, Zahida, Elettra,

01:20.713 --> 01:24.451
Billy, Sam, Sarah... Oi, oi.
...and Chelsea.

01:24.517 --> 01:28.655
It's one of me mates, Chelsea,
and I'm fucking buzzing to see her.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.524
This could be the girl
to get me over my Marnie issues.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.092
She is fit as fuck.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.529
Not all of the newbies
are gonna make the cut.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.732
And we get to help Anna decide.
We have the power!

01:39.799 --> 01:42.268
Sarah is very good
and very consistent.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.903
Abi has done all right, mind.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.372
It's true,
Sarah and Abbie are good at work,

01:46.439 --> 01:49.843
but more importantly, they feel
like they fit in with the group.

01:49.909 --> 01:54.013
One Marty finger stroking Elettra's
clitty clitty bang bang.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.450
Seeing Marty with Elettra
has got me confused.

01:57.517 --> 01:59.586
He is playing with my emotions.

01:59.652 --> 02:02.555
I wanna kiss Chelsea's fanny.
Ooh!

02:03.890 --> 02:06.226
Marnie, I don't think
you should see this.

02:06.292 --> 02:10.463
I really don't think you should
see this. Oh, God, man!

02:13.967 --> 02:17.971
This situation with Aaron and
Chelsea has made things difficult.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.673
Right now,
I don't know if I'll come back.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.544
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.880
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.616
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.051
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.187
I'm preened to perfection.

02:34.254 --> 02:36.589
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.425
I'm cheeky, colourful,
full of mischief.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.362
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:42.428 --> 02:45.965
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.568
(all) Geordie Shore, Why-aye!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.682
Elettra, bye.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.984
Bye-bye.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.455
(laughs)
She just fucking fist bumped you.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.059
Last night's house party
was pure wicked.

03:13.126 --> 03:16.362
I actually fingered Elettra
in the hot tub.

03:16.429 --> 03:19.632
Slow progress, but at least
I gave her a cheeky digit.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.241
I can't believe Marnie's gone.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.376
Marnie left last night.

03:30.443 --> 03:33.446
She seen Aaron and Chelsea
on top of each other,

03:33.513 --> 03:35.648
and it looked like
they were shagging.

03:35.715 --> 03:36.783
That's gonna hurt.

03:36.849 --> 03:39.586
Nathan, you do know
Marnie's gone, babe? Mm?

03:39.652 --> 03:43.022
We 100% seen them two
on top of each other.

03:43.089 --> 03:44.090
I know.

03:44.824 --> 03:48.261
If Aaron truly respected Marnie
like he makes out that he does,

03:48.328 --> 03:51.764
he would never have gone to
the shag pad with Chelsea.

03:51.831 --> 03:55.935
For Marnie to see that
with her own eyes is very hurtful.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.303
Mm.

04:04.644 --> 04:08.281
Last night started out wicked.
The newbies smashed the house party.

04:08.348 --> 04:12.285
And then Marnie kicked off and cock
blocked me from shagging Chelsea.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.153
Big question is...

04:15.722 --> 04:16.923
Did you pump?

04:16.990 --> 04:21.327
It was just about to go in when
Marnie come shouted, "Fucking slag."

04:21.394 --> 04:24.297
Marnie told me she wanted me to
get with other people.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.966
And she told Chelsea it's fine
if she got with me.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.669
Then, when it happened,
she started kicking off.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.204
I can't make any sense of it.

04:31.270 --> 04:35.041
You cannot be happy in a relationship
and love someone

04:35.108 --> 04:39.145
if you're kicking off at
someone else. She's jealous.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.649
It just makes her relationship
look pathetic.

04:42.715 --> 04:45.852
Listen, in the hot tub last night,
I poked Elettra.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.520
Fucking hell, Marty.
Fuck!

04:47.587 --> 04:49.288
I don't know what to say.

04:49.355 --> 04:52.392
Woo-hoo, you fingered her.
Dream on. As if.

04:54.494 --> 04:55.495
(laughs)

04:57.196 --> 05:00.333
The house party, for me,
has been the best night so far.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.169
Really, really good.
Yeah, it was unreal.

05:03.236 --> 05:06.305
Most of us new workers
have been here for a while now.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.775
I finally feel like
we're part of the team.

05:08.841 --> 05:11.778
I'm having such a good time
and I don't want it to end.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.147
I've got loads of fucking food
in my hair.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.883
It's fucking rotten.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.557
How are you?

05:25.358 --> 05:27.527
Last night with Aaron
was going so well,

05:27.593 --> 05:29.729
until Marnie kicked off
and ruined it.

05:29.796 --> 05:33.399
She said I could get with him. She
said one thing and meant another.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.535
No sex?
None. Not again.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.805
No. No? No.
What happened with you and Martin?

05:38.871 --> 05:41.441
He was in the hot tub with you
for about an hour.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.676
Last night, the party was
so incredible,

05:43.743 --> 05:47.213
and I decide to go to the Jacuzzi
with Martin.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.818
I have four beautiful fingers.

05:51.884 --> 05:54.821
I can do everything you want.
Everything you want.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.423
By myself. Imagine.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.225
You don't need anybody else.
No.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.765
Last night, when it kicked off,
everybody was fast asleep.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.935
Nobody knows Marnie's left.
I've gotta let them know.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.003
Right, yous!

06:12.038 --> 06:15.208
So, erm, last night, Marnie's left.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.745
It took Marnie two years
to get Aaron into bed.

06:18.811 --> 06:23.082
He's only knew Chelsea a few hours,
and he's trying to shag her.

06:23.149 --> 06:27.286
I think she didn't expect to see,
obviously, Aaron and Chelsea

06:27.353 --> 06:30.723
get together, even though
I know she said that you could.

06:30.790 --> 06:34.327
My stomach's dropped down me arse.
I can't believe Marnie's left

06:34.393 --> 06:37.296
because of me. I wish she'd
told us how she really felt.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.398
Obviously,
she's very close with you,

06:39.465 --> 06:43.069
and I think when she's seen it, it's
hurt her more than she expected.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.937
What the fuck is going on?

06:45.004 --> 06:48.541
Marnie's got a boyfriend, but she
left because of me and Chelsea.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.110
I don't get what goes on
in that girl's head.

06:54.947 --> 06:57.850
My feet are literally
sticking to the floor.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.020
The worst thing about throwing
your own house parties is,

07:01.087 --> 07:03.823
we're the ones who've gotta
clean up. Gutted.

07:03.890 --> 07:07.059
Come on, Elettra. Pick it back up.
It's my first time.

07:07.126 --> 07:10.663
Missed a bit. At least one of the
boys got some action last night.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.565
Marty finally fingered Elettra.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.568
But I'm gonna ask her,
cos I'm not sure it's quite true.

07:15.635 --> 07:16.769
Elettra?

07:19.205 --> 07:21.107
You last night. (laughs)

07:21.174 --> 07:22.241
That's what he said.

07:22.308 --> 07:27.747
Marty say that me and Marty
fingered, but it's not true. Why?

07:27.814 --> 07:29.582
You're a liar.
I'm not a liar.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.185
Yeah.
I'm not a liar. Come on. No.

07:32.251 --> 07:36.222
we're not in year 8, and I'm not
lying about a fucking finger.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.624
When? Tell me when.
The hot tub last night.

07:38.691 --> 07:42.028
What is hot tub?
Hot tub. Jacuzzi.

07:42.094 --> 07:43.729
Marty, you been telling fibs?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.365
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

07:46.432 --> 07:49.468
Maybe he want to show off
to the other boys, but... mm-mm.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.537
I was...

07:51.604 --> 07:54.707
I was...
# Lying, why you always lying? #

07:54.774 --> 07:56.409
Why the fuck would I lie?
Liar!

07:56.475 --> 07:59.045
I'm not surprised that
Elettra's kicking off.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.814
That boy is such a liar.
You can't trust him.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.385
Slippy slide, finger in.
No! No, not true!

08:07.753 --> 08:10.056
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?

08:10.122 --> 08:12.892
Marty... (speaks Italian)

08:12.959 --> 08:16.529
Marty, it was all a dream.
(laughter)

08:16.596 --> 08:19.365
I was in a fucking Jacuzzi, OK?

08:19.432 --> 08:21.067
And I have my fucking...

08:21.133 --> 08:23.970
(speaks Italian)

08:24.036 --> 08:27.340
Whoa! What the fuck does that mean?
I have a dress on!

08:27.406 --> 08:30.376
I am so angry with Marty.
All I do is kiss him.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.677
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.179
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.482
You never touch me.
You're a fucking liar.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.618
You're a fucking liar.
You're crazy.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.986
No, you are crazy.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.823
Gaz is having to hold Elettra back.
I don't know where to put myself.

08:43.890 --> 08:47.526
All this over a fucking finger.
Imagine you banged her. (laughter)

08:47.593 --> 08:48.728
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:56.235 --> 08:59.305
(phone rings)

08:59.372 --> 09:02.041
we're cleaning up the shit tip
and the phone goes.

09:02.108 --> 09:05.344
And I know it's gonna be Anna,
and I know she'll be miserable.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.612
Cos she always is.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.614
Hello.
"Hi, Sophie, How are you?"

09:08.681 --> 09:10.883
Erm... all right.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.786
Marnie's gone
"What?"

09:13.853 --> 09:14.921
Marnie's gone.

09:14.987 --> 09:18.557
Chelsea's came into this house,
got with Aaron, upset Marnie

09:18.624 --> 09:19.859
and made her leave.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.260
And I'm not having that.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.664
The new girl, Chelsea, came in
and she's got with Aaron.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.301
Even though Marnie's got a
boyfriend, it hurts, Anna.

09:28.367 --> 09:31.737
Marnie's just got up and went.
She can't deal with it.

09:31.804 --> 09:35.341
"Sophie, I'm not happy about that."
I know.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.811
"Right, I've got a really
important event tomorrow night,

09:38.878 --> 09:41.213
and I need my best workers on it."
OK.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.984
"Sophie, I won't be taking everyone.
Some of the new workers

09:45.051 --> 09:47.320
won't make it."

09:47.386 --> 09:51.123
Fucking hell. Anna's gonna start
getting rid of some of the newbies.

09:51.190 --> 09:54.760
Everyone's been getting along.
We're getting used to having them.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.396
"I'm going away to
think about it some more,

09:57.463 --> 10:01.267
but I've taken everything you've
all told me recently on board." OK.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.236
"Tomorrow,
I'm going to make my first cut."

10:04.303 --> 10:06.372
The newbies are gonna be devastated.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.109
Marnie's already left, and it's
gonna make things ten times worse.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.044
I'll have to keep this a secret.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.279
Bye.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.882
Right, you're gonna have to
blag this one, Sophie.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.785
Blame it on Anna and get
everyone cleaning, pronto.

10:19.852 --> 10:23.189
(clears throat) So... She just
said we need to tidy the house.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.325
Let's go, let's go.
Tidy. Come on, everyone.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.927
That was easy.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.404
It's time to get ourselves
looking mint,

10:38.471 --> 10:41.440
head downtown for some
primo party action.

10:41.507 --> 10:42.842
One, two, three.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.343
(all) Danger.
(laughs)

10:47.279 --> 10:48.948
Are you gonna put a bra on?

10:49.015 --> 10:53.185
Why would I ever wear a bra when
I've got the perfect perky titties?

10:53.252 --> 10:57.023
Real women don't wear bras.
You're not real. Yeah, I fucking am.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.824
Your face isn't.
(laughs)

11:01.694 --> 11:03.529
All of us are out,
we've got no work.

11:03.596 --> 11:08.067
Woo! It's a free night,
so let's go fucking mental!

11:08.134 --> 11:09.135
(all cheer)

11:10.803 --> 11:14.340
Look, if you're only doing this
to piss Marty off, allow me to help.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.543
Marty... They're trying to
make us jealous. It's working.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.782
I don't need to hear this.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.717
What the fuck has happened now?

11:25.951 --> 11:27.486
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:32.992 --> 11:33.192
.

11:35.728 --> 11:35.928
.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.277
I'm buzzing, cos we're gonna
get lit in illegitimate tonight.

11:54.747 --> 11:58.484
Let's get fucking mortal!
(all cheer)

11:59.919 --> 12:02.354
I can tell tonight
is gonna be pure mint.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.629
Me and Chloe, tonight,
have a lot of fun.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.064
Twerking, dancing. Woo!

12:15.568 --> 12:19.405
Look, if you're only doing this to
piss Marty off, allow me to help.

12:20.573 --> 12:25.010
Marty, this morning, to say that
you finger me, fucking liar.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.382
Fuck me, we've been
in the club two minutes,

12:30.449 --> 12:32.985
and Chloe and Elettra
are already necking on.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.160
Er, Marty is like...

12:42.495 --> 12:45.798
I look over and I see Chloe
all over Elettra again.

12:45.865 --> 12:49.001
They're just trying to make us
jealous, and it's working.

12:53.572 --> 12:57.409
Get over yourself, Marty. It's not
my fault that Elettra fancies me

12:57.476 --> 12:58.878
more than she fancies ye.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.656
I wanna chat to Chelsea.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.893
I don't want her getting freaked out
because Marnie left.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.799
If I'm gonna go there with Aaron,
I need Marnie to be OK with it.

13:20.866 --> 13:24.603
I'm so confused. I wish Marnie had
been honest with us from the start.

13:30.809 --> 13:34.246
Look, Chelsea, at the end of
the day, Marnie's got a boyfriend.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.483
All I wanna do is spent the night
in the shag pad with you.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.856
I've had an unreal night tonight.

13:43.923 --> 13:47.960
Drinks have been flowing, I've been
dancing me little porridge arse off.

13:48.027 --> 13:51.530
But Abbie, on the other hand, I
don't even think she knows her name.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.810
Right, here, Elettra, I've got
a plan that's gonna get you

14:04.877 --> 14:06.912
away from Chloe and back to me.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.520
I can do nothing if people
want to kiss me. I'm beautiful.

14:21.794 --> 14:24.296
We haven't spoke to Chelsea
since yesterday.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.799
I need to tell her
how much she's hurt Marnie.

14:32.972 --> 14:36.041
I feel like Sophie's speaking to me
like a piece of shit.

14:36.108 --> 14:39.211
I know she's Marnie's cousin
and she's protecting her,

14:39.278 --> 14:41.847
but I genuinely don't know
what I've done wrong.

14:47.987 --> 14:51.123
Everything Sophie is saying
is what I'm already thinking.

14:51.190 --> 14:54.293
I don't need to hear this.
I just want to speak to Marnie.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.565
Maybe I have went in too hard
with Chelsea.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.835
But if Marnie was here,
it would be 100 times worse.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.943
If I didn't feel bad before,
I certainly do now.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.412
All I wanted to do
was speak to Marnie,

15:13.479 --> 15:15.214
not get shit off everyone else.

15:23.722 --> 15:28.494
I am mashed, and me and Chloe
are dancing like absolute tits.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.063
After a few voddys,
there is no limit.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.906
I spot Chelsea crying her eyes out.
I'm not happy about this.

15:40.973 --> 15:45.010
Something's going on. We're meant to
be looking after these new workers.

15:53.485 --> 15:55.387
I've just found out from Chelsea

15:55.454 --> 15:58.357
that Sophie's been given her
loads of fucking shit.

15:58.424 --> 15:59.692
I need to sort this out.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.162
I turn around,
and Chelsea is in tears.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.197
What the fuck has happened now?

16:08.867 --> 16:12.538
Since I've arrived, I've tried
to make a big impression and fit in.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.973
Now, I feel like
I've ruined everything.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.683
I see Marty storm over to Sophie
and have a go at her.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.487
I'm not having that, like.
So I'm gonna go in and defend her.

16:37.963 --> 16:41.967
Marty loves getting involved in
other people's businesses

16:42.034 --> 16:44.903
and casing arguments.
It's pissed us off this time.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.143
Here's another drink,
you little fucking prick.

16:52.277 --> 16:54.346
Just cos I'm standing up
for Chelsea,

16:54.413 --> 16:57.282
Chloe and Sophie decide to hoy
peeve all over us.

16:57.349 --> 17:00.052
Them two girls really need to
look at themselves.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.954
Cos I'm getting proper pissed off.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.089
I don't know what the fuck
is going on.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.760
Tonight has just gone
completely west.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.762
Let's just get the hell out of here.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.307
Hey! Come on, bitches!

17:24.041 --> 17:26.178
We're back at the house
and I'm mortal.

17:26.244 --> 17:29.381
I haven't got a clue which way's up
and which way's down.

17:29.448 --> 17:30.949
Mission accomplished.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.685
This is your bed, Abbie.

17:37.055 --> 17:38.257
I'm gonna go to bed.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.560
I was having such a good night
till Marty fucked it up.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.096
I just wanna go to bed,
wake up tomorrow

17:44.163 --> 17:47.466
and find Marnie in this bed,
where she belongs.

17:47.533 --> 17:52.104
You are the nastiest person
I've ever met in my entire life.

17:52.171 --> 17:56.341
I don't know what it is about Marty,
he boils my piss like no-one else,

17:56.408 --> 17:58.343
and I don't know how to stop it.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.246
I am angry because you
upset people in the house.

18:01.313 --> 18:04.183
You're just fucking jealous
cos I don't fancy you.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.717
Oh, yeah(!)

18:05.784 --> 18:07.519
Chloe starts kicking off.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.421
Why won't she just leave me alone?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.423
Fuck off, you little divvy, right?

18:11.490 --> 18:14.960
And your five pence piece
on your necklace. Fuck off, man.

18:15.027 --> 18:18.163
Today started bad, and it's
been getting worse and worse.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.965
That's it, I've had enough.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.300
Fucking, me nasty?

18:21.366 --> 18:23.969
(indistinct shouting)
Martin, Martin. Howay.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.205
Get the fuck off me.
Martin, howay, man.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.106
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:28.173 --> 18:32.144
Marty has just pushed Sam. Everyone
needs to calm the fuck down now,

18:32.211 --> 18:34.446
before someone actually gets hurt.

18:36.715 --> 18:40.586
Oh, shit. I think I might have
pushed Marty too far this time.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.721
And I hate seeing him in this state.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.160
Marty's kicking off about
what happened Sophie.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.429
I need to calm him down.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.198
No-one like me in this house.
Mate, shut the fuck up.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.700
All the boys love you, man.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.536
I am fucking pissed off
about Sophie and Chloe.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.172
And now Sam is actually
calming us down.

19:00.239 --> 19:01.907
And I am sorry for pushing him.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.177
All I've done tonight is
stick up for people and be nice,

19:05.244 --> 19:07.779
try and sort things out.
That's all I've done.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.182
But she still thinks
that I'm the evil one.

19:10.249 --> 19:11.884
What have I done?

19:11.950 --> 19:14.453
Thank fuck I've managed to
calm Marty down.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.723
He needs to forget about it
and get himself to bed.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.904
Chelsea's struggling with Marnie
leaving and everyone turning on her,

19:31.970 --> 19:34.573
so tonight,
I'm gonna keep her company.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.845
I do really, really like Aaron.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.482
But if it's gonna cause all this
drama, is it really worth it?

19:43.549 --> 19:46.485
I just wanna say,
I want you to stay,

19:46.552 --> 19:48.086
I don't want you to go.

19:48.153 --> 19:49.888
Is that OK?

19:49.955 --> 19:53.158
I need Marnie to come back,
so I can find out what's going on

19:53.225 --> 19:56.094
in that girl's head.
But for now, let's get some sleep.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.398
And hopefully, everything
will be better in the morning.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.000
Hello?

20:02.067 --> 20:05.103
I've gotta tell some of the newbies
to leave.

20:05.170 --> 20:08.907
That was Anna on the phone. She's
chose who she thinks can make the cut

20:08.974 --> 20:10.008
in this house.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.377
Oh, my God,
I'm not ready to say bye yet.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.712
First person is...

20:20.485 --> 20:20.686
.

20:23.188 --> 20:23.388
.

20:31.229 --> 20:34.066
I don't remember much,
but I think I had a good night.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.801
Mm.
I think I did.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.639
(burps) Morning, campers.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.307
Then there was three.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.778
The three... ugly sisters.
Three musketeers.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.681
I've woke up, and I wish
I could tell Chloe and Nathan

20:49.748 --> 20:52.117
that some of the newbies
will be going today,

20:52.184 --> 20:54.519
but I think I should just
keep it to myself.

20:54.586 --> 20:59.024
I think who I'd like to stay,
Sarah or Abbie.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.060
Cos I get on really well
with Sarah, and Abbie's funny.

21:02.127 --> 21:06.698
I'm scared though, cos even though
we've give Anna all this advice,

21:06.765 --> 21:08.533
you know what she's like.

21:14.706 --> 21:17.009
I can't believe,
after last night's drama,

21:17.075 --> 21:20.278
I've woken up with Aaron again.
This is gonna go down well.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.347
What did Sophie say to you
last night?

21:22.414 --> 21:24.783
(sighs) Just loads of stuff.

21:24.850 --> 21:28.186
I've woken up this morning,
and I'm still fucking pissed off

21:28.253 --> 21:31.423
that Sophie has to stick her nose
in anyone's business.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.059
If Marnie is so in love
with her new boyfriend,

21:34.126 --> 21:36.361
why are they so bothered what I do?

21:36.428 --> 21:38.730
I feel like everyone's
annoyed at me.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.034
I've got loads of bridges to build
and it's not gonna be easy.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.148
Did you shag Chelsea last night?

21:56.214 --> 21:58.116
Not a fucking stitch.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.485
Even without Marnie here.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.689
Marnie wasn't even
in the house last night,

22:03.755 --> 22:06.491
and she still cock blocked Aaron.

22:06.558 --> 22:08.126
That's insane.

22:08.193 --> 22:10.562
Why was Chloe
kicking off last night?

22:10.629 --> 22:14.299
I didn't say one nasty thing.
I kicked the phone box instead.

22:14.366 --> 22:16.334
I had the worst night ever.

22:16.401 --> 22:18.804
I got pied off Elettra,
Chloe had a go at us,

22:18.870 --> 22:21.006
and I ended up
smashing the phone box up.

22:21.073 --> 22:23.875
I'm not looking forward to
what Anna's got to say.

22:29.815 --> 22:30.816
(laughs)

22:34.352 --> 22:36.588
Oh, God. I'm starving.

22:36.655 --> 22:39.057
(phone rings)
Oh, shit.

22:39.124 --> 22:42.694
Getting bollocked, you, son.
How am I meant to open the door?

22:42.761 --> 22:44.229
Just climb in there.

22:44.296 --> 22:47.065
I've got a feeling this is gonna be
a bad phone call.

22:47.132 --> 22:50.068
Like when the doctor rings
and says I've got the clap.

22:50.135 --> 22:53.538
"I heard about you kicking off,
Marty. It's unacceptable."

22:53.605 --> 22:56.541
"You are supposed to set an example
to the new workers."

22:56.608 --> 23:00.245
Aye, well, you should have seen
the grief I got off this lot.

23:00.312 --> 23:04.082
"There's no more misbehaving,
do you understand?" OK.

23:04.149 --> 23:06.985
"Will you put Gary on?"
Aye. Here, Gaz?

23:07.052 --> 23:11.056
Cannot believe I just got away with
a slap on the wrist. I am sorry.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.926
But Anna must have bigger things on
her mind than a fucked-up phone box.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.294
Hello?

23:16.361 --> 23:19.264
"Hi, Gary. How's it going?"
Yeah, good. You all right?

23:19.331 --> 23:22.968
That's gotta be Anna with the news
that one of the newbies is leaving.

23:23.034 --> 23:25.437
I just hope she listened to us
about Chelsea.

23:25.504 --> 23:28.173
"I've got a massive event on."
Right.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.444
"It's called Party Tyne, and it's
a huge Geordie scene night."

23:32.511 --> 23:34.846
"I need to make sure
it's a proper success."

23:34.913 --> 23:36.815
"I need the best team running it."

23:36.882 --> 23:40.418
I'm on the phone to Anna, she's
saying she's got this massive event,

23:40.485 --> 23:42.320
but she only needs the best team.

23:42.387 --> 23:43.822
What does that even mean?

23:43.889 --> 23:47.225
"Now, as you know, I can't take
all the newbies on full time."

23:47.292 --> 23:48.293
Right, yep.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.898
"And I've made a decision
of who I won't be needing."

23:52.964 --> 23:54.099
All right.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.767
"You might not agree with me,

23:55.834 --> 23:58.703
but I feel that these
are the strongest people."

24:01.706 --> 24:04.676
Oh, my God,
I'm not ready to say bye yet. Fuck!

24:05.510 --> 24:08.513
"These are the newbies
staying on..." OK.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.917
I really don't want
Billy and Sarah to go home.

24:11.983 --> 24:15.420
I get on with them really well
and they're such nice people.

24:15.487 --> 24:16.488
Right. Yep.

24:16.555 --> 24:20.525
"You'll need to tell the others to
pack their bags and go home." OK.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.761
"Thanks, Gary."
Speak to you later.

24:22.828 --> 24:23.895
"Bye."

24:23.962 --> 24:25.063
Oh.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.999
Get everyone in.
Girls!

24:28.066 --> 24:30.168
Oh, my God.

24:30.235 --> 24:33.939
I've gotta tell some of the newbies
that they've gotta leave.

24:34.005 --> 24:37.509
This is gonna be horrendous.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.845
Er...

24:39.911 --> 24:41.680
Everyone looks so serious.

24:41.746 --> 24:44.349
What the fuck
is this gonna be about?

24:48.186 --> 24:50.722
That was Anna on the phone.
She basically said

24:50.789 --> 24:53.825
that she's got a huge party tonight.

24:53.892 --> 24:57.529
Erm, she's literally took everything
we said into consideration

24:57.596 --> 25:00.932
and she's literally just chose
who she thinks can make the cut

25:00.999 --> 25:03.702
in this house. If I basically
don't say your name,

25:03.768 --> 25:07.439
you've gotta pack your bags
and go home. Right now, go home?

25:07.505 --> 25:10.242
Right now. God, Gary,
I don't know how you can do it.

25:10.308 --> 25:14.145
There's no easy way of doing this.
People's names you say are staying?

25:14.212 --> 25:17.382
If Gary mentions the name,
you get to go to the event tonight.

25:17.449 --> 25:20.252
And if he doesn't,
you have to go home straight away.

25:20.318 --> 25:21.453
That is brutal.

25:21.519 --> 25:24.055
Here, good luck. Yous, good luck.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.558
(clears throat)
Right. Let's get on with it.

25:26.625 --> 25:30.762
First person who's coming to work
with us tonight is...

25:37.769 --> 25:40.739
Oh, and out of nowhere,
Gary's turned into Ant and Dec.

25:40.805 --> 25:42.540
Fucking get on with it, man.

25:42.607 --> 25:43.909
...Abbie.

25:43.975 --> 25:46.611
(applause)

25:46.678 --> 25:50.749
Gaz has just called my name first.
I'm finally part of the family.

25:50.815 --> 25:52.918
I am absolutely buzzing.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.788
Oh, this is fucking awful,
this, like.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.456
I'm shaking like a leaf.

25:58.523 --> 26:01.259
This is awful.
I'm literally gonna cry.

26:01.326 --> 26:04.362
Right, and the second person is...

26:06.064 --> 26:07.565
...Sam.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.868
Well done.
Well done, Samuel.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.438
Sam's name is next to be called out.

26:13.505 --> 26:16.841
I'm really happy for him,
but I'm feeling worried for myself.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.444
Right, the third person is... Zahida.

26:20.612 --> 26:22.247
(applause)

26:23.515 --> 26:25.817
Thank fuck. What a relief.

26:25.884 --> 26:29.721
I don't need to pack me suitcase,
but I might need to change me pants.

26:30.789 --> 26:34.659
There's another person coming
to work tonight, and that is Sarah.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.027
Yay!

26:36.094 --> 26:37.996
(applause)
Well done, Saz.

26:39.197 --> 26:42.701
I can't believe it. I haven't
got the sack. Fucking buzzing.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.803
And the last person is...

26:44.869 --> 26:48.573
Drumroll.
The last person to stay is...

26:48.640 --> 26:51.309
...Elettra.
Eh?

26:51.376 --> 26:54.446
Elettra?! What the fuck, Anna?
Are you pissed?

26:54.512 --> 26:58.883
Ah. Ah. Ooh.
So, I think it's Billy, Eve, Chelsea,

26:58.950 --> 27:02.020
unfortunately you're gonna
pack your bags and...

27:02.087 --> 27:03.855
Sweet.

27:03.922 --> 27:07.425
Anna's been absolutely brutal.
I'm not ready to go home yet.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.160
What, they've gotta leave now?

27:09.227 --> 27:13.331
They gotta pack, and then we've gotta
start prepping for the party tonight.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.735
Fuck. This means I'm going home.
I'm genuinely wounded.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.904
I think I just come out of me shell
that little bit too late.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.339
All right?
Yeah.

27:21.406 --> 27:22.807
Sure?

27:26.444 --> 27:29.047
Chelsea leaving
might be a good thing.

27:29.114 --> 27:32.884
I don't think Marnie could live
in this house if Chelsea was here.

27:41.192 --> 27:43.495
I go to pack me bags,
and Aaron comes in.

27:43.561 --> 27:46.664
I can't believe I've gotta
say bye to him already.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.433
You all right? Give us a cuddle.

27:49.801 --> 27:52.937
Aaron seems just as gutted as me
that I've gotta go home.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.373
He's probably the person
I'll miss the most.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.009
Fuck knows what Anna's playing at.

27:58.076 --> 27:59.677
But I'll let you get packed.

28:00.478 --> 28:03.848
Slide back in me DMs. (laughs)

28:10.588 --> 28:14.059
Just wanna say bye to
Billy, Eve and Chelsea.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.327
Erm, yous were all wicked,
to be fair.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.897
So... it is shit,
but we've gotta go to work.

28:18.963 --> 28:21.366
See ya later, mate.
Give us a cuddle.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.436
It's so hard to say bye
to Eve, Billy and Chelsea.

28:25.503 --> 28:28.239
Cos we were starting to feel
like a real family.

28:28.306 --> 28:31.476
Bye, everybody.
Bye. Bye.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.412
Me best mate.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.383
Brutal, that, isn't it
Yeah.

28:38.450 --> 28:42.253
Bye, guys. See yas later. Love yous.

28:42.320 --> 28:46.057
This is our family now, so we
need to pull ourselves together

28:46.124 --> 28:48.960
cos we've got
a Geordie party to organise.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.866
I'm all packed and it's time to go.

28:54.933 --> 28:57.902
It's really hard to say me
last goodbyes to this house.

28:57.969 --> 28:59.504
I'm fucking devastated.

29:04.709 --> 29:07.679
(sobs)

29:07.745 --> 29:09.814
Fuck's sake.

29:13.518 --> 29:16.121
I'm absolutely gutted to be leaving.

29:16.187 --> 29:18.623
Things have just started
with me and Aaron,

29:18.690 --> 29:20.892
and now I don't know what'll happen.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.465
Hiya.
I am buzzing that Marnie's back.

29:27.532 --> 29:30.301
Aaron got with one of me
best mates. It's not right.

29:30.368 --> 29:31.836
I loved you!

29:33.438 --> 29:35.173
Incoming.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.575
Wow.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.478
Ooh, look at your willy.
I do have some news.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.147
Oh, my God.

29:42.213 --> 29:44.816
Shit. What's happening next?

29:50.955 --> 29:51.156
.

29:53.691 --> 29:53.892
.

30:05.370 --> 30:08.573
As hard as it was to say bye
to Eve, Billy and Chelsea,

30:08.640 --> 30:13.011
we are now having drinks, and these
newbies aren't newbies any more.

30:13.077 --> 30:14.846
They are now part of the team.

30:14.913 --> 30:18.049
Well done, everybody. well done.

30:18.116 --> 30:20.785
Yous really deserve it.
Yous have done amazing.

30:20.852 --> 30:24.455
I feel like I've put so much graft
into work, I'm just glad that...

30:24.522 --> 30:28.459
they made the right decision.
You cut wuh hair.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.197
(laughs) It's wicked to see how
buzzing everybody is to be now

30:32.263 --> 30:35.099
part of this family.
But it doesn't stop now.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.468
This party tonight,
I wanna see more effort

30:37.535 --> 30:39.370
than they've ever put in before.

30:39.437 --> 30:42.774
Have we gotta think of a theme?
The theme is Party Tyne.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.343
The theme for tonight's party
is Party Tyne.

30:45.410 --> 30:49.214
But Tyne really means time.
You see what we've done there?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.682
Anna wants a big party.

30:50.748 --> 30:52.383
Let's fucking give her one.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.687
Right, we've got loads to fucking
do, so we need to get going

30:55.753 --> 30:57.488
and sort this shit clean out.

30:57.555 --> 30:58.623
Ready?
Let's go.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.159
Good team meeting, guys.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.532
Me and Aaron,
cos we're most creative,

31:07.599 --> 31:10.668
are taking Abbie, Sam and Sarah
to get the props

31:10.735 --> 31:12.503
ready for the venue tonight.

31:12.570 --> 31:15.039
Aaron.
You're meant to be professional.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.609
Fog on the Tyne. Perfect.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.611
Fucking dinosaur.

31:19.677 --> 31:21.479
Aaron.
Rah!

31:21.546 --> 31:25.917
Yous, I feel like yous aren't
taking it very seriously.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.387
We've got some amazing props
and I can't wait to show the others.

31:29.454 --> 31:32.457
Time to get back to the house
so they can go dress the club.

31:32.523 --> 31:35.360
I'd love a cup of tea.
(laughs)

31:39.731 --> 31:42.500
We need to get these preparations
sorted.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.669
It's gonna be a big banner, this.

31:44.736 --> 31:48.806
It's just such a shame that Marnie
won't be here to enjoy it with us.

31:49.774 --> 31:51.643
To me. To you.

31:51.709 --> 31:54.846
The Angel of the North
is the icon of Newcastle,

31:54.912 --> 31:58.249
and we can't have party on the
fucking Tyne without it.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.653
We're nicking the fucking angel
out of the garden. Howay, man.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.054
On the bed. On the bed.

32:03.121 --> 32:05.690
Me and Elettra are turning
Sheila the mannequin

32:05.757 --> 32:07.325
into the Angel of the North.

32:07.392 --> 32:09.427
Caribbean?
Yes.

32:09.494 --> 32:12.263
Oh, she's orange. Looks like Abbie.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.198
Sheila is looking so hot now.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.200
I cannot keep me hands off her.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.202
I'll sit on her face.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.473
Aah! Her nose is up me bumhole!

32:28.279 --> 32:32.383
Right, we've got all the props. Time
to dress the venue ready for tonight

32:33.251 --> 32:35.787
Oh.
What a spanner.

32:35.853 --> 32:38.222
We are doing a fucking sick job.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.892
Tonight, this place
will look amazing.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.661
(all) Oh!
Oh! Yes!

32:43.728 --> 32:46.564
Dressing this venue
with Gary, Aaron and Marty

32:46.631 --> 32:48.800
makes us feel like one of the lads.

32:50.568 --> 32:53.404
(laughter)

33:00.111 --> 33:03.381
I've been away a couple of days,
just to get me head together.

33:03.448 --> 33:06.451
I shouldn't get wound up with Aaron
getting with anyone.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.487
But it just wasn't nice
seeing it right under me nose.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.323
Hiya.
Yay!

33:12.390 --> 33:13.424
You all right?

33:14.292 --> 33:17.328
Aah!
We're very glad. Are you?

33:17.395 --> 33:19.263
I am buzzing that Marnie's back.

33:19.330 --> 33:23.101
She'll be delighted to know
that Chelsea has fucked off.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.702
Chelsea's gone.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.838
Ooh, he's awake.
How do you feel?

33:26.904 --> 33:30.241
Relieved? Not gonna lie,
I'm fucking buzzing she's gone.

33:30.308 --> 33:33.077
Serves her right. Karma is a bitch.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.886
Bonjour.
Je m'appelle.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.622
(wolf whistles)

33:44.689 --> 33:48.459
Yous have been gone ages. We had to
decorate the fucking club, Nathan.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.130
We get back to the house, telling
everyone how sick the club looks...

33:52.196 --> 33:54.298
What the fuck?
Fucking hell, Marnie.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.400
Hey, Marnie.
Hi.

33:55.466 --> 33:57.135
I didn't even see you there.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.737
Aaron didn't even look at us
when he walked in.

33:59.804 --> 34:02.240
I'm a lot stronger now,
I won't let it get to us.

34:02.306 --> 34:04.342
Come on. everyone go get ready.

34:04.409 --> 34:06.577
I'm gonna move my shit
in the boys' room.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.146
(cheering)

34:16.554 --> 34:18.255
the club's ready, we're ready.

34:18.322 --> 34:23.226
It's a massive night, let's go
and do what we do best. (all cheer)

34:23.293 --> 34:24.295
Go, go, go.

34:24.362 --> 34:26.364
Everyone's looking fucking wicked.

34:26.431 --> 34:29.801
So, here's to tonight, having
a mint event, smashing work,

34:29.867 --> 34:33.938
then going out and ripping a hole
in the fucking Toon.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.373
Oh, Sheila!
Oh, she's down!

34:41.344 --> 34:44.549
We've arrived at the venue,
and the lads have done a sick job.

34:44.614 --> 34:46.150
The place looks wicked.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.254
Where are yous going tonight?
Are you coming in here?

34:50.321 --> 34:51.322
(cheering)

34:51.389 --> 34:55.326
Zahida's standing on massive stilts,
wearing these massive feathers.

34:55.393 --> 34:58.930
I guarantee you she gets a lot of
lads in, cos she is looking decent.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.809
Me and Marty might not
have been getting on,

35:11.876 --> 35:14.745
but we need to work together
so tonight is a success.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.047
Howay, you radgies.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.484
Go!
Go, go, go, go.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.885
Go, go, go!
Right.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.020
We're gonna have a dance competition.

35:23.087 --> 35:26.023
the games are always
my favourite part of the events,

35:26.090 --> 35:27.925
cos they're so fucking funny.

35:27.992 --> 35:30.628
We're gonna have a twerk-off.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.430
I show you how to do, baby.

35:35.066 --> 35:37.635
Let me show ya how it's really done.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.242
Now, time for
a cheeky game for Abbie.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.845
Fake an orgasm.
No.

35:47.912 --> 35:49.413
(laughter)

35:50.448 --> 35:52.350
I've been right stitched up here.

35:53.251 --> 35:55.887
(moans)

35:58.589 --> 36:02.360
It's too much to resist.
Me and Chloe have to get stuck in.

36:03.794 --> 36:06.264
(moaning)

36:06.330 --> 36:08.799
Me and Marnie coulda orgasmed
all night!

36:13.004 --> 36:17.475
There's no way this guy can deep
throat anything better than me.

36:20.878 --> 36:23.414
Oh, Nathan, that is impressive.

36:25.550 --> 36:26.751
(all exclaim)

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
Motherfucker!

36:34.025 --> 36:35.693
This place is bouncing.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.729
All the guests look like
they're having a mint time

36:38.796 --> 36:41.866
and they're all so drunk.
This has been a success.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.167
Yo, yo, yo!

36:43.234 --> 36:45.703
Put your hands in the fucking air

36:45.770 --> 36:48.172
if you have had
a Geordie good night!

36:48.239 --> 36:49.607
(cheering)

36:49.674 --> 36:51.208
We have smashed work.

36:51.275 --> 36:55.813
Time to celebrate and go to the
fucking club and party big style.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.788
Welcome to the family.

37:03.854 --> 37:05.389
(screaming)

37:05.456 --> 37:06.857
Tonight has been wicked,

37:06.924 --> 37:10.294
and I'm so happy that now I feel
like I'm a part of the family.

37:15.933 --> 37:21.038
Chloe! Chloe! Chloe! Chloe!
(cheering)

37:21.105 --> 37:23.407
Ah! Me knee, man! Oh!

37:25.810 --> 37:29.246
Where's the fucking ice bucket?
I need the ice bucket!

37:34.552 --> 37:37.688
Above anything that's happened,
Aaron means a lot to us,

37:37.755 --> 37:40.091
and I think of him as
one of me best friends.

37:40.157 --> 37:41.959
I don't wanna not speak to him.

37:45.029 --> 37:48.633
After everything we've been through,
tonight, I'll hear her out.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.323
Aaron just can't understand
what he's done wrong.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.325
He got with one of me best mates

38:14.392 --> 38:18.396
five minutes after her walking in
the house. That's not right.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.237
How can we be friends if she's gonna
keep going on like she is?

38:33.344 --> 38:36.080
Why is she saying this?
I thought she had a boyfriend

38:36.147 --> 38:37.948
and I thought she was happy.

38:43.387 --> 38:47.425
I never meant to hurt Marnie. I need
to tell her that nothing happened.

38:47.491 --> 38:50.828
Her friendship means more to me
than getting with anyone else.

38:50.895 --> 38:51.929
Marnie?

38:55.332 --> 38:58.736
Marnie, you know and I know that
I'd never, ever wanna hurt you.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.344
It's obvious that there's unfinished
business between them two.

39:07.411 --> 39:09.814
I don't think it's totally over
between them.

39:12.083 --> 39:15.720
Even though me and Marnie have wuh
arguments, we're like best mates.

39:15.786 --> 39:17.188
I don't want to lose that.

39:26.464 --> 39:28.966
I'm so happy me and Aaron
are friends again.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.670
Hopefully now, we can have
a really good night tonight.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.176
It's been a great night,
We smashed work.

39:39.243 --> 39:42.613
But I wanna get back to the house
and carry on the party!

39:42.680 --> 39:44.548
Oh, let's go, let's go!

39:50.988 --> 39:52.923
Whoa. Whoa.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.158
(screams)

39:57.161 --> 39:59.363
These newbies have done really well.

39:59.430 --> 40:02.299
But come on,
they've learned from the best.

40:02.366 --> 40:04.602
To the new and formed family.

40:04.668 --> 40:06.670
(all cheer)

40:10.074 --> 40:12.376
This could only mean one thing.

40:12.443 --> 40:15.646
I'm getting out of here
before I get covered in that shit.

40:18.883 --> 40:21.886
I am glad that me and Marty
have made up.

40:21.952 --> 40:24.455
We can't keep pressing
each other's buttons

40:24.522 --> 40:27.925
and winding each other up,
cos we will lose wuh friendship.

40:27.992 --> 40:31.562
Oh! Oh, Chloe's getting violent!
Oh!

40:31.629 --> 40:33.697
I have no food
to throw back at yous.

40:33.764 --> 40:36.433
Nathan, maybe this'll help.
Incoming.

40:38.335 --> 40:39.737
Yes!

40:39.804 --> 40:43.107
Gary, you little fucker.
That nearly took us off my feet.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.442
Wow.
Ooh, look at your willy.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.079
Me and Marty in the shower in a
non-sexy way,

40:49.146 --> 40:53.083
checking each other's bits out.
But everyone does it. It's normal.

40:56.854 --> 41:00.291
Food fights are always the
perfect way to end the night.

41:00.357 --> 41:03.027
Now I'm going to bed,
before I get egged again.

41:17.007 --> 41:18.309
The house is a mess.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.878
So bad. It's worse than it looked.

41:20.945 --> 41:24.949
The hallway will be disgusting.
There'll be egg everywhere.

41:27.318 --> 41:31.288
I wake up this morning,
and the house is fucking rotten.

41:31.355 --> 41:34.558
There's loads of leftover food
lying everywhere.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.327
And it fucking stinks.

41:38.529 --> 41:41.532
Sophie, are they your boots?
Aye, I do want them.

41:45.269 --> 41:49.406
Oh. Have you seen the state of this
house? I can't even open the door.

41:49.473 --> 41:52.376
Anna and her saggy tits
have rocked up to the house.

41:52.443 --> 41:55.746
And the place is a fucking mess.
Shit's about to get real.

41:55.813 --> 41:58.048
It's a mess! As usual.

41:58.883 --> 42:03.120
Anyway, mess aside, I must say I am
pretty impressed with last night.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.723
Anna's being nice.
She must be getting shagged.

42:05.789 --> 42:07.591
Yous pulled it out of the bag.

42:08.826 --> 42:11.028
But I'm not here
just to say thank you.

42:12.496 --> 42:15.165
I do have some news
for the new workers.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.403
What the fuck, Anna?
You crusty bitch.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.338
What else have you got planned?

42:21.405 --> 42:24.008
Been a really tough decision
for me...

42:25.910 --> 42:29.380
...but I'm not gonna be able to
keep yous all on full time.

42:29.446 --> 42:31.882
Oh, my God.
I hate this.

42:31.949 --> 42:35.586
What the hell? Anna's actually
gonna get rid of more people?

42:35.653 --> 42:37.321
This is awful.

42:41.492 --> 42:45.729
Shit. If this isn't over,
what's happening next?

42:47.331 --> 42:49.500
I'm going skiing, bitches!

42:49.566 --> 42:53.170
Anna is sending wuh skiing
in France for work!

42:53.237 --> 42:55.940
What a belter!
(laughter)

42:56.006 --> 42:59.276
(cheering) Oh, yeah.
Look at that pool in there.

42:59.343 --> 43:01.211
This chalet is unbelievable.

43:01.278 --> 43:04.081
You think you're gonna
get away with that? (screams)

43:04.148 --> 43:07.451
Guess who's fucking back.
That's right, it's Scotty Turbo T.

43:07.518 --> 43:11.522
All the way from the Toon with his
big fucking baguette. To me!

43:11.588 --> 43:13.290
Hello!

43:13.357 --> 43:15.726
So, these must be the newbies.
Hello.

43:15.793 --> 43:19.163
Scott has already got his tongue
in the back of me throat.

43:20.531 --> 43:22.933
Abbie's got her eye on Scott
as well.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.904
I fancy anything with a fanny.
This is gonna be interesting.

43:52.429 --> 43:52.629
.
