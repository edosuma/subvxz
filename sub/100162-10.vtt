[Elizabeth] <i>How are you?</i>

00:39.640 --> 00:40.960
I'm fine.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
You don't look fine.

00:47.320 --> 00:48.680
It's quarter to twelve.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.880
-Where are the children?
-Nanny.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.440
They wouldn't like me before midday.

00:56.760 --> 00:57.760
[lighter clicks]

01:01.600 --> 01:02.880
What happened here?

01:07.480 --> 01:09.400
An exchange of views.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.640
Oh, Margaret.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.760
[Margaret] I forget what about.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.240
There are so many
exchanges of views these days.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.640
[Elizabeth] I thought things had moved on.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.280
-[dog whimpers]
-Oh, they've moved on, all right.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.800
He's moved on.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.080
On to the next one.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.160
He can't help himself.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.640
My priapic little snapper.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.680
[dog barks]

02:41.080 --> 02:42.240
[chuckles]

02:44.400 --> 02:46.320
[toilet flushes]

02:50.360 --> 02:52.760
You've never told me about the wallpaper.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.880
The rogue's gallery. Isn't it fun?

02:56.720 --> 02:59.280
I did it to remind Princess Margaret

02:59.360 --> 03:02.640
that her family has as many skeletons
in the cupboard as anyone else's.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.240
-[she chuckles]
-House of Windsor?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.760
House of Horrors, more like.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.160
I hope she saw the funny side.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.080
[chuckles] God, no.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.560
She said as long as that wallpaper
was there, she'd never come to the house.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.280
Not that she needed an excuse.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.080
She always hated it here.

03:19.720 --> 03:24.320
She considers it as ugly, misshapen,
and common as me.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.200
-[chuckles]
-The failure of our marriage

03:27.440 --> 03:29.400
could not be better encapsulated

03:29.480 --> 03:32.000
by the two houses, the two dwellings,

03:32.080 --> 03:34.360
in which she and I are most comfortable.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.520
-Hers...
-[blows smoke]

03:37.600 --> 03:41.680
...some insect-infested gin palace

03:41.760 --> 03:44.160
given to her by fawning sycophants.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.560
And this... is mine.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.680
[chuckles]

03:49.720 --> 03:51.080
Oh, you two.

03:52.240 --> 03:53.600
I know.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.480
And poor you to get caught up in it.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.680
My advice would be to escape
while you still can.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.240
I'll never be able to give you
what you want.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.880
She'll never divorce me.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.920
She might
if she falls in love with someone else.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.000
What makes you think that will happen?

04:16.040 --> 04:17.240
Well, you did.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.200
Didn't you?

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
[sighs]

04:24.200 --> 04:25.160
You're right.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.240
I did.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
[thunder]

05:46.360 --> 05:48.360
[indistinct chatter]

05:50.520 --> 05:52.520
[horns blare in the distance]

05:54.320 --> 05:55.400
[car door shuts]

05:55.560 --> 05:59.000
[TV] <i>With MPs from smaller parties
holding the balance of power,</i>

05:59.080 --> 06:00.520
<i>both Labour and the Tories</i>

06:00.600 --> 06:05.160
<i>look unable to reach
the magic number of 318.</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:07.320
[Anne] I'm sure it was her.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.440
-The Thing?
-[Anne] She has a name, you know.

06:13.080 --> 06:17.080
Yes, and, um, I have been told it,

06:17.520 --> 06:21.080
but I can never remember,
so I call her the Thing.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.080
-Lucy Lindsay-Hogg.
-Hm-hmm. The Thing.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.440
And the car she climbed into outside
looked very much like Tony's.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.760
I suppose they're in Sussex now.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.720
-Ugly little house.
-Hmm.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.600
-Dreadful little shed.
-[chuckles]

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
And he thinks I'll take the humiliation
lying down, does he?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.000
Well, he's got another thing coming.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.840
May I speak frankly, ma'am? As a friend?

06:58.840 --> 07:01.960
I can think of several couples
of whom it could be observed

07:02.040 --> 07:06.360
that having not found the contentment
they desired within matrimony,

07:07.160 --> 07:10.680
have chosen to live apart,
and appeared happier.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.200
Tony and I
will never let go of one another.

07:13.520 --> 07:17.200
And it's not just because divorce
is incompatible with my faith,

07:17.600 --> 07:18.640
but because...

07:19.480 --> 07:22.200
this is just how we like it.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.120
War is our love.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.560
A brutal fight to the death
is our mating dance,

07:29.680 --> 07:32.040
and I speak for both of us when I say

07:32.120 --> 07:34.520
we wouldn't want it any other way.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.160
Contentment is dull,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.440
and Tony and I are anything but dull.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.760
[TV] <i>We can now say with near certainty</i>

07:44.840 --> 07:47.600
<i>that neither party
will achieve a majority.</i>

07:47.800 --> 07:49.480
<i>So, the clock is now ticking</i>

07:49.560 --> 07:53.120
<i>for Ted Heath to form an alliance
with Jeremy Thorpe's Liberal Party.</i>

07:53.200 --> 07:56.680
<i>If he can't, we might well see
a return to power for Harold Wilson.</i>

07:56.760 --> 07:59.920
<i>If you can call
a minority government "power."</i>

08:00.000 --> 08:00.960
What a mess.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.320
I mean, honestly, can you remember a time
when the country was in worse shape?

08:04.720 --> 08:07.760
Or one had as little confidence
in one's leaders?

08:07.840 --> 08:10.960
-Speaking of bad shape--
-One wakes up in the morning flinching.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.400
How could matters get any worse?
What more could possibly go wrong?

08:14.480 --> 08:17.040
And then you come down to breakfast,
you see the newspapers,

08:17.120 --> 08:19.520
and you realize, they've done it again.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.120
Margaret's birthday is coming up.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.720
I mean, right now the United Kingdom

08:22.800 --> 08:26.200
is the equivalent of a patient
dying on the operating table

08:26.280 --> 08:29.680
and the surgeons, no, the butchers,
no, sorry, the murderers

08:29.760 --> 08:32.920
responsible for causing that death
are seeking re-election.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.040
Instead of throwing them in jail,
the people, like lemmings,

08:36.480 --> 08:38.760
are queuing up
to extend their bloody contracts.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.520
She called me late last night.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.640
Said she had something important
to discuss.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.120
-Who?
-Margaret.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.920
-She's run out of tonic?
-No.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.480
-Been knocked up by one of the footmen?
-Philip!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.240
You wouldn't put it past her.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.200
I worry it's Tony.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
[car door shuts]

08:59.720 --> 09:00.640
Ready?

09:03.080 --> 09:06.120
<i>Mr. Heath came to tell me
that he was unable to form a coalition</i>

09:06.200 --> 09:08.640
with the Ulster Unionists or the Liberals,

09:08.720 --> 09:11.200
which left him with no alternative
but to resign,

09:11.280 --> 09:13.320
at which point, I don't mind admitting,

09:13.400 --> 09:15.320
I let out an unconstitutional cheer.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.200
-Huzzah!
-Privately, I hope.

09:17.280 --> 09:20.760
Well, it's not his politics I object to
so much as his company.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.640
And now Mr. Wilson,

09:22.720 --> 09:25.080
who, I must say,
looks very tired and not at all well,

09:25.160 --> 09:28.200
is back again as prime minister
of a minority government,

09:28.280 --> 09:29.720
and the best we can hope for

09:29.800 --> 09:33.240
is that he can survive
until the next election in the autumn.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.080
[glass rings]

09:37.560 --> 09:40.400
Oh, really? Yes, that's... Oh!

09:40.480 --> 09:41.800
[chatter fades out]

09:44.960 --> 09:46.920
-[ding]
-[chuckles]

09:48.200 --> 09:49.960
I have asked you all here,

09:50.680 --> 09:51.880
my family,

09:53.200 --> 09:54.920
on the occasion of my birthday.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.880
-Many happy returns.
-Happy birthday, Margot.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.400
If you've noticed that my dear husband
is not at my side on this joyous occasion,

10:02.480 --> 10:04.440
it is because he is now betraying me,

10:04.520 --> 10:07.640
and not just in private,
but openly, in public, too.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.040
And I don't think
we should take this lying down.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.800
-We?
-[Margaret] Yes, "we," Mummy.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.440
If Tony insults me,

10:14.520 --> 10:17.560
by implication, he's insulting
the whole of the family, too.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.200
-I'm not sure I follow that logic.
-What would you like us to do?

10:20.280 --> 10:24.480
Send a clear signal to the world
whose side you're on.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.280
-And impose sanctions.
-What?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.320
What kind of sanctions?

10:29.400 --> 10:32.080
No more invitations to royal events.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.880
No more royal photographs.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.760
No more access to Crown property.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.720
Hit him where it hurts.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.640
Punish him. Draw blood.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.080
[Queen Mother] Where is he now?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.240
He left the country this morning,

10:45.000 --> 10:46.840
to make one of his films.

10:46.920 --> 10:48.960
Ghana, was it? Or did you say Guinea?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.040
-[Margaret] Gabon.
-Ah.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.280
With the Thing.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.200
-The what?
-I'll explain later.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.280
[Queen Mother]
I rather liked his last film.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.000
-[Philip] Was that the one about dwarfs?
-Yes, it's short.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.800
[Queen Mother] It had compassion.
It had kindness.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.400
In fact, I think that's the thing
I most like about Tony.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
[Elizabeth] And his wit.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.680
[Queen Mother] Yes, and the fact
that he's generous enough

11:08.120 --> 11:09.640
to flirt with his mother-in-law.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.640
-[guests laugh]
-I'm going to throw up.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.160
-[Queen Mother] He cares.
-[Margaret] All right, Mummy.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.400
[Queen Mother] He has a heart.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.280
Not that his wife or children
have noticed.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.520
[Philip]
His charity work for the disabled,

11:19.600 --> 11:23.280
and the way he was at Aberfan
was remarkable...

11:23.360 --> 11:24.680
[overlapping chatter]

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
Enough!

11:26.840 --> 11:27.840
Enough!

11:32.360 --> 11:33.680
Why do you do this, Mummy?

11:35.680 --> 11:37.280
Why do you all do this?

11:37.560 --> 11:39.800
Why do you always, always take his side?

11:41.920 --> 11:43.920
This is my birthday party.

11:45.600 --> 11:49.640
And when I tell you
that my husband is out of the country

11:49.720 --> 11:51.760
betraying me with another woman,

11:52.080 --> 11:54.240
instead of supporting me

11:55.120 --> 11:56.800
and... and condemning him,

11:57.400 --> 11:59.320
you just sit here praising him to the sky.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.520
My family.

12:06.280 --> 12:09.320
My own flesh and blood. My birthday.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.120
Perhaps we're just sick to the back teeth
of you, and have sympathy for him.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.960
-Philip!
-Well, I mean...

12:21.880 --> 12:22.960
Am I wrong?

12:23.520 --> 12:25.720
Hands up anyone who thinks I'm wrong.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.720
Anne.

12:29.440 --> 12:32.120
-[chuckles]
-Well... [clears throat]

12:33.320 --> 12:35.760
We should eat these before they get cold,
shouldn't we?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.600
She'll be all right in a minute.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.960
[Margaret] <i>I hate them.</i>

12:40.040 --> 12:43.160
-I hate them.
-[Anne] <i>Why don't you come here, ma'am?</i>

12:43.240 --> 12:44.720
<i>Come to Glen.</i>

12:45.280 --> 12:47.880
We've invited a few guests
for the weekend.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.320
<i>Come here. You might even enjoy it.</i>

13:32.960 --> 13:33.960
[train horn blares]

14:18.280 --> 14:19.160
[glass shatters]

14:20.120 --> 14:24.360
-I don't have the time.
-Make time! You make time for her!

14:25.040 --> 14:27.520
-What a brat you are!
-You're a shit!

14:28.120 --> 14:30.120
-No! Tony!
-Piss off!

15:15.160 --> 15:17.160
[birds chirp]

15:19.520 --> 15:20.560

15:33.040 --> 15:34.000
Thank you.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.240
[snores]

16:44.320 --> 16:46.480
[Anne] Thank you. Everyone back inside.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.160
[engine stops]

17:13.040 --> 17:14.240
What about Hugo?

17:15.520 --> 17:18.280
We were thinking of tying
a ribbon round him for you.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.000
Oof, no.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.160
How could he ever be thrilled with me?

17:23.240 --> 17:25.560
He's so excessively thrilled with himself.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.960
Or Clive?

17:27.760 --> 17:28.920
-Clive?
-Hmm.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.400
He's married.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.280
So are you, ma'am.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.120
Yes, I do know that.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.680
[dogs bark]

17:35.960 --> 17:38.840
[Anne] His wife is known
to give him the green light to play away.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.200
Word is...

17:42.800 --> 17:45.000
he's quite the virtuoso.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.000
What about him?
The one with all his clothes on.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.760
Oh, that's Roddy.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.640
You must know his brother, Dai.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.120
Or his father, Harry Llewellyn,

18:03.200 --> 18:04.720
the Olympic show jumper.

18:05.760 --> 18:08.440
Roddy! Roddy.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.240
Rufus.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.080
Hello.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.480
Hmm!

18:15.560 --> 18:17.720
Your Royal Highness, how do you do?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.760
You're... you're perspiring.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.400
Uh, true, I am, ma'am.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.760
-So, why don't you jump in the pool?
-[Roddy] Well, I didn't bring any trunks.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.480
-That was stupid.
-[Roddy] No, it wasn't.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.320
Yes, it was. I just said it was.

18:30.640 --> 18:31.760
It can't be stupid.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.720
I don't possess any trunks.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.000
That's not just stupid, that's absurd.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.000
[chuckles]

18:38.000 --> 18:39.320
Where's the nearest town?

18:41.400 --> 18:42.280
Oh...

18:46.720 --> 18:49.080
You know, this really wasn't necessary.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.120
On the contrary. It was essential.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.400
I mean, everyone else coming along, too.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.840
Hmm? They're not coming with us.
I wouldn't let them.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.080
No, they're going for lunch,
while we go shopping.

19:04.880 --> 19:10.680
So, apart from owning
a woefully inadequate wardrobe,

19:11.200 --> 19:12.360
what is that you do?

19:12.680 --> 19:15.600
A research assistant
at the College of Arms.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.520
Uh, which involves genealogical research,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.600
-and boning up on heraldry.
-Hmm.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.360
I also have a mobile disco company,
called Vibrations.

19:26.080 --> 19:29.160
And I clean the floors
in a gallery on the Fulham Road at night.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.080
But all of this is just
to fund my real passion.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.960
Have we got to the end of the answer yet?
I'm rather regretting asking.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.560
What nice hands you've got.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.720
-Have I?
-Hmm.

19:41.920 --> 19:42.840
Hmm.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.480
How nice you'd not noticed.

19:46.360 --> 19:50.240
It's so nice when a man is unaware
of his best features.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.800
And so sad when a lady hides hers.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.920
Did you mean these?

19:59.440 --> 20:00.360
No.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.280
What, then?

20:03.800 --> 20:04.800
Your smile.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.200
I've forgotten how.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.760
-Where are we?
-[driver] Peebles, ma'am.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.200
Where?

20:29.480 --> 20:30.520
-Oh.
-Ah.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.760
This is the hotel.
We'll be in the bar waiting for you.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.680
The department store's
over there on the right.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.200
You can't miss it.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.520
-Would you--
-OK.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.120
[Margaret sighs]

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
Oh, God.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.320
-We've stumbled upon an experiment in...
-Excuse me.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.160
...inbreeding.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.680
["Squeeze Box" by The Who plays]

21:02.960 --> 21:04.480
Your Royal Highness.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.800
-Gentleman's bathing trunks, please.
-Um...

21:07.880 --> 21:09.960
-What size are you?
-Uh, small.

21:10.640 --> 21:11.880
I sincerely hope not.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.800
He means slim.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.240
[chuckles]

21:24.320 --> 21:27.640
Did we ever get to the bit
where you told me your passion in life?

21:28.040 --> 21:29.080
No.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.000
Then what is it?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.160
Gardening, ma'am.

21:36.240 --> 21:37.280
Ah...

21:39.040 --> 21:40.280
These, please.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.880
No, these.

21:43.320 --> 21:46.360
I'm paying. I choose. Try them on.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.160
Oh.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.720
You know,
I have a garden that needs doing.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.520
[Roddy] Do you? I imagine
you must have an army of gardeners.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.640
Don't believe everything you hear.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.680
No, my garden is quite neglected.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.160
-Especially the one in Mustique.
-[Roddy] Where?

22:25.520 --> 22:28.520
It's a small private island
in the Caribbean.

22:31.360 --> 22:32.600
[Roddy] How lovely.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.360
Hmm. My husband hates it.

22:35.320 --> 22:38.640
But since I hate my husband,
what he thinks is irrelevant.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.000
[Roddy] You know, in the Caribbean,

22:41.080 --> 22:43.040
they have one of my favorite trees.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.680
The silk cotton tree.

22:46.680 --> 22:50.200
The challenge for any gardener
is to judge the right amount of pruning.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.840
Is that so?

22:52.280 --> 22:55.240
[Roddy]
Well, you need very nimble fingers.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.360
[sniffs]

22:59.600 --> 23:00.480
[clears throat]

23:04.320 --> 23:06.120
And do you have nimble,

23:06.200 --> 23:07.840
as well as pretty fingers?

23:09.760 --> 23:10.920
I do.

23:13.640 --> 23:16.320
Hmm. Hmm! Perfect.

[Anne] At the top of the stairs,
instead of turning right...

25:29.400 --> 25:32.360
-[Colin] He turned left.
-[Anne] What have we done?

25:32.960 --> 25:35.840
-This could come back to haunt us.
-Why?

25:36.240 --> 25:40.160
It will look like we've encouraged
the Queen's sister to betray her husband.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.840
She's not betraying Tony. She's with Tony.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.440
Can't you see?

25:46.000 --> 25:48.680
-Slim, Welsh, reddish hair.
-Hmm.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.640
The two men are virtually identical.

25:50.720 --> 25:54.680

Just younger.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.600
I hadn't thought of that.

-[tires screech]

-[Tony] Your Majesty.
-Dear Tony.

26:32.320 --> 26:34.600
So kind of you to come.
I know how busy you are.

26:42.680 --> 26:44.200
Before we start...

26:47.120 --> 26:49.760
just look what I found in my studio
the other day.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.360
-How young we were.
-[Tony] How pretty you were.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.960
-Oh, stop it.
-[Tony] Like Vivien Leigh.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.040
[gasps]

26:58.960 --> 27:02.040
-I've always loved this picture.
-[Tony] Yes.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.800
Gosh. Philip.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.520
Not looking cross for once. Miraculous.

27:06.600 --> 27:07.640
[both chuckle]

27:07.720 --> 27:09.280
-[Tony] All yours, ma'am.
-For me?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.400
-[Tony] With my compliments.
-Oh.

27:11.960 --> 27:15.280
And now... to the main business.

27:19.640 --> 27:20.600
<i>Voilà.</i>

27:21.560 --> 27:22.600
A mug.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.200
[Tony] And...

27:31.080 --> 27:31.960
A teapot.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.840
[dog barks]

27:35.720 --> 27:36.920
And...

27:40.400 --> 27:42.760
-Oh.
-[Tony] A commemorative plate.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.360
And a tea towel

27:47.800 --> 27:51.960
with the dates 1952 to 1977.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.680
The powers that be
thought it might be nice

27:56.760 --> 27:58.440
if someone from inside the firm

27:58.520 --> 28:01.120
were to design some of the memorabilia.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.520
-Oh, Tony, you are clever.
-Always happy to help my family.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.360
Are you?

28:07.560 --> 28:09.320
Let's talk about that for a minute.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.440
-May I keep these, as well?
-Yes. Yes, of course.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.120
Now, I don't want to...

28:16.160 --> 28:20.840
pry or lecture anyone
about what goes on in a marriage.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.680
In my experience people,
find a way to do what they need to do

28:24.760 --> 28:27.120
to remain happy or sane.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.600
I often think turning a blind eye
is the best approach.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.960
Things work themselves out in the end.

28:35.720 --> 28:39.800
But recently,
Margaret has been so wretched...

28:41.120 --> 28:42.680
and so lost...

28:44.400 --> 28:45.920
and she's so in love with you.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.800
I wouldn't be a responsible elder sister,
or head of the family,

28:49.880 --> 28:51.360
if I didn't say

28:51.440 --> 28:55.400
how happy it would make us all,
but particularly Margaret,

28:55.480 --> 28:57.840
if you two were to patch things up again,

28:57.920 --> 28:59.520
even if just for the children.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.400
I quite agree...

29:04.680 --> 29:07.560
and had been giving the matter
serious thought.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.720
-Had you really?
-[Tony] Yes.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.600
But then,
I heard the latest developments.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.600
Who she's met.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.480
What she's doing.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.320
How she's...

29:23.040 --> 29:24.960
conducting herself.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.480
What latest developments?

29:33.280 --> 29:34.200
Hmm.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.560
They're here!

30:08.240 --> 30:10.200
-Welcome, Your Royal Highness.
-Colin.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.760
-No, I don't think kissing.
-No, quite right.

30:12.840 --> 30:13.840
I'm hot and sweaty.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.520
-Hello.
-Yes, isn't it unbearable?

30:15.600 --> 30:17.920
What are you talking about?
The weather's lovely.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.920
-You're right. Heavenly.
-It's the aeroplane that was hot.

30:21.000 --> 30:21.880
Hello.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.400
-Is this us?
-[Colin] Yes, ma'am.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.760
Yes, I think straight to the house.
I don't want any of that.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.400
[Anne] Right. Go on.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.000
-Hello, Anne.
-Hello.

30:30.080 --> 30:33.080
Where's the boy?
Look, do keep up now. Come on.

30:33.160 --> 30:36.600
-I'm sorry, darling.
-Don't call me that in public, ever.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.280
I'd rather you didn't call me boy.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.720
-But you are one. You're a little boy...
-Steady.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.680
...who needs to be taught everything.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.680
-Hmm.
-[Colin] Ma'am.

It's not just age. No.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.720
It's been diagnosed. It has a name.

43:12.440 --> 43:13.840
Alzheimer's.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.000
I first noticed symptoms two years ago.

43:29.640 --> 43:32.040
I always speak in public without notes.

43:32.120 --> 43:34.400
I've something of a photographic memory.

43:35.800 --> 43:39.800
But then one day, I dried.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.560
And in the months that followed,

43:43.480 --> 43:46.480
I noticed more... forgetfulness.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.960
Agitation.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.400
Delusion.

Paranoia.

43:56.400 --> 43:57.760
I shouldn't worry too much.

43:58.480 --> 44:01.640
Several of your predecessors
had far more serious afflictions,

44:01.720 --> 44:04.640
and they continued to govern
without the public being any the wiser.

Uh, no, ma'am,

44:15.280 --> 44:16.960
Oh, Prime Minister, I am sorry.

44:17.720 --> 44:19.720
This will come as a terrible shock.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.360
Well, maybe, but, uh...

44:22.160 --> 44:24.920
No shock lasts longer than 48 hours.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.920
There's too much appetite
for the next shock.

44:31.280 --> 44:33.240
I'll miss our sessions terribly.

44:34.520 --> 44:37.760
I don't mind admitting
I let out an unconstitutional cheer

44:37.840 --> 44:39.640

44:39.720 --> 44:40.920
Oh... [chuckles]

I always said deep down,
you're a leftie at heart.

44:44.080 --> 44:47.000
Nothing to do with the politics.
You're just a better companion.

44:47.800 --> 44:50.240
Although, I wouldn't have said that
the first time we met.

I was going to rough you lot up.

But that's an honor
previously only given to Churchill.

45:48.520 --> 45:51.360

Used in short periods
for the relief of anxiety and insomnia.

Based on the numbers
of empty packets we found.

46:55.280 --> 46:58.880
[Queen Mother] You would say
more indicative of a cry for attention,

than a genuine suicide attempt?

though perhaps I should.

48:14.120 --> 48:15.280
Why?

48:15.560 --> 48:18.080
Because for a while there,
it was touch and go.

How do you feel now?

Tired.

48:43.840 --> 48:44.920
A bit sore.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.640
Tony and I are going to separate.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.880
Yes, I think that's probably wise.

49:38.960 --> 49:42.640
Which, I'm afraid to say,
will lead to divorce.

49:42.720 --> 49:43.760
Yes.

[Margaret] The first royal divorce
since Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves.

I have a little bit of good news
in that department.

49:52.200 --> 49:53.320
[Margaret] Which is?

49:54.000 --> 49:57.240
If we time it right,
the announcement of your separation

49:57.320 --> 49:59.720
might get lost
in the Prime Minister's resignation.

50:00.160 --> 50:03.680
I thought he only just got re-elected.
Or did I really miss something?

50:03.760 --> 50:06.680
Due to ill health. Alzheimer's.

50:08.720 --> 50:09.880
I'm sorry.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.560
How many does that make it?

50:17.440 --> 50:19.240
-Prime ministers?
-Hmm.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.720
Whoever replaces him will be my seventh.

50:22.080 --> 50:23.560
[sighs]

50:23.640 --> 50:25.440
The rest of us drop like flies,

50:26.320 --> 50:29.400
but she goes on and on.

50:53.680 --> 50:56.280
For the record, I think
there are many things you're good at.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.800
Name one that's actually meaningful.

50:59.520 --> 51:00.840
Being a sister.

51:00.920 --> 51:04.080
-[sighs] No need to humor me.
-I'm not.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.240
Of all the people everywhere,

51:07.880 --> 51:10.200
you are the closest,
and most important to me.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.160
And if by doing this...

51:14.240 --> 51:16.000
you wanted to let me imagine
for one minute

51:16.080 --> 51:17.960
what life would be like without you...

51:19.760 --> 51:21.080
you succeeded.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.040
It would be unbearable.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.120
Then we must both carry on.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.240
-Morning.
-Morning, Your Majesty.

52:22.080 --> 52:23.720
Good morning, Your Majesty.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.320

[radio] <i>Usually when I drive
into Broadcasting House</i>

52:35.640 --> 52:36.960
<i>just after five in the morning,</i>

52:37.040 --> 52:39.360
<i>the most I'm likely to see
is a bread delivery van,</i>

52:39.440 --> 52:41.080
<i>or an office cleaner on the way to work,</i>

52:41.160 --> 52:44.520
<i>but this morning, despite the dark skies,
there was a feeling of activity.</i>

52:44.600 --> 52:46.800
<i>A string of horses
clattering through the streets,</i>

52:46.880 --> 52:49.360
<i>and lots of people
wearing red, white and blue gear</i>

52:49.440 --> 52:51.760
<i>drifting down towards Trafalgar Square.</i>

52:52.080 --> 52:53.760
<i>But what of those who've been up all night</i>

52:53.840 --> 52:55.960
<i>to make sure of getting
a good view of the procession?</i>

52:56.040 --> 52:58.960
<i>Andy Price is with them
outside Buckingham Palace.</i>

52:59.040 --> 53:01.040
[Price] <i>I'm standing
in front of Buckingham Palace</i>

53:01.120 --> 53:04.040
<i>and I expect the Queen's teasmade
has just rung her back to consciousness.</i>

53:04.120 --> 53:05.120
Hello.

53:05.200 --> 53:07.240
<i>I expect she's lying there
just coming to,</i>

53:07.320 --> 53:09.400
<i>and remembering that this is Jubilee Day.</i>

53:09.480 --> 53:12.960
<i>This is a day as grueling
as her coronation 25 years ago,</i>

53:13.040 --> 53:14.560
<i>certainly in ceremonial terms.</i>

53:14.640 --> 53:17.440
<i>But she was a mere slip of a thing
in those days.</i>

53:17.520 --> 53:19.880
<i>I expect today she's wondering
if the shoes she's gonna wear</i>

53:19.960 --> 53:22.320
<i>are quite as comfortable
as they might be.</i>

53:22.400 --> 53:24.800
<i>Now, the weather looks as though,
as I say,</i>

53:24.880 --> 53:28.480
<i>as though it's certainly
going to hold for the journey out.</i>

53:29.480 --> 53:31.480
[Elizabeth]
<i>What's your view of the Jubilee?</i>

53:35.560 --> 53:36.920
You must do it.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.080
You don't think
it might all backfire on me?

53:43.400 --> 53:45.360
Ask yourself,
in the time I've been on the throne,

53:45.440 --> 53:46.960
what have I actually achieved?

53:47.760 --> 53:49.000
You've been calm...

53:50.280 --> 53:51.560
and stable and--

53:51.640 --> 53:53.320
Useless and unhelpful.

53:54.200 --> 53:57.360
This country was still great
when I came to the throne, and now look.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.600
So much for the Second Elizabethan Age,
which Winston talked about.

54:03.200 --> 54:06.000
All that's happened on my watch
is the place has fallen apart.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.720
[Margaret]
<i>It's only fallen apart if we say it has.</i>

54:10.720 --> 54:12.560
<i>That's the thing about the monarchy.</i>

54:14.680 --> 54:16.200
We paper over the cracks.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.080
<i>And if what we do</i>

54:19.160 --> 54:22.800
<i>is loud and grand and confident enough,</i>

54:23.360 --> 54:27.000
<i>no one will notice
that all around us it's fallen apart.</i>

54:27.600 --> 54:29.000
<i>That's the point of us.</i>

54:31.840 --> 54:32.920
Not us.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.200
Of you.

54:36.920 --> 54:39.560
You cannot flinch.

54:41.080 --> 54:44.320
<i>Because if you show a single crack,</i>

54:45.200 --> 54:48.040
<i>we'll see it isn't a crack, but a chasm,</i>

54:48.640 --> 54:50.200
<i>and we'll all fall in.</i>

54:52.880 --> 54:55.760
So you must hold it all together.

54:58.960 --> 55:00.800
Must I do that alone?

55:02.240 --> 55:04.000
There is only one queen.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.720
[presenter on radio] <i>And now
the Poet Laureate, Sir John Betjeman.</i>

55:14.000 --> 55:15.560

55:17.480 --> 55:21.360
[Betjeman] <i>In days of disillusion,
However low we've been,</i>

55:22.000 --> 55:24.280
<i>To fire us and inspire us</i>

55:25.080 --> 55:27.720
<i>God gave to us our Queen.</i>

55:28.880 --> 55:31.600
<i>She acceded, young and dutiful,</i>

55:32.080 --> 55:34.440
<i>To a much-loved father's throne.</i>

55:34.520 --> 55:38.000
<i>Serene and kind and beautiful,</i>

55:38.080 --> 55:40.200
<i>She holds us as her own.</i>

55:41.200 --> 55:43.680
<i>And 25 years later,</i>

55:44.160 --> 55:46.240
<i>So sure her reign has been</i>

55:47.000 --> 55:50.080
<i>That our great events are greater</i>

55:50.160 --> 55:52.680
<i>For the presence of our Queen.</i>

55:54.920 --> 55:57.080
<i>For our Monarch and her people,</i>

55:57.160 --> 55:59.320
<i>United yet and free,</i>

55:59.400 --> 56:02.520
<i>Let the bells from ev'ry steeple</i>

56:02.600 --> 56:05.400
<i>Ring out loud the jubilee.</i>

56:31.880 --> 56:33.880
