All right, team, today we're going to work

00:42.718 --> 00:44.861
on an elevator for the skyscraper.

00:44.863 --> 00:46.236
- Awesome!
- Whoo-hoo!

00:46.238 --> 00:47.581
Yay!

00:47.583 --> 00:50.044
Um, an elevator?

00:50.046 --> 00:52.924
Well, Muck, when you've got
a building as tall as this,

00:52.926 --> 00:56.221
it's far too high to get up
and down using the stairs,

00:56.223 --> 01:00.669
so we build a little carriage
you can ride, called an elevator.

01:00.671 --> 01:03.901
Press a button, and it will
take you all the way to the top.

01:03.903 --> 01:06.460
Where you can see all of Spring City.

01:06.462 --> 01:07.837
Wow!

01:07.839 --> 01:09.821
All of Spring City.

01:09.823 --> 01:12.509
I want to see all of Spring City.

01:12.511 --> 01:13.692
Can I ride the elevator?

01:13.694 --> 01:15.548
Please, please, please, please, please!

01:15.550 --> 01:16.508
Sorry, Scoop.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.485
I think you're a bit
too big for the elevator.

01:19.487 --> 01:22.268
Yeah, your back end would hang out.

01:22.270 --> 01:23.709
Oh.

01:23.711 --> 01:26.107
Tiny, can we have the loading cage, please?

01:26.109 --> 01:28.647
TINY: <i>Coming right down, Bob.</i>

01:31.838 --> 01:33.309
Thanks, Tiny.

01:33.311 --> 01:35.677

the top and get started.

01:35.679 --> 01:38.524
Can you guys load those materials
into the cage for us, please?

01:38.526 --> 01:39.580
No prob, Bob.

01:39.582 --> 01:41.149

01:56.319 --> 01:57.821
Thank you, Mr. Bentley.

01:57.823 --> 01:59.388
That will do.

01:59.390 --> 02:01.149
Now, Bob,

02:01.151 --> 02:03.196
I'd like to go up to the top floor, please.

02:03.198 --> 02:05.340
There may be a bit of a problem with that.

02:05.342 --> 02:08.412
We haven't put the elevator in yet.

02:08.413 --> 02:10.779
But I have to get my photo taken at the top

- Oh.
- There is the service one.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.308
No, I don't think so.

We'll come back later.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.924
Mr. Bentley.

02:28.926 --> 02:31.740
Oh, well, uh, uh, we
could come back at 4:00.

02:31.742 --> 02:34.075
4:00? 4:00 it is, then.

02:34.077 --> 02:36.956
That means I'll have plenty
of time to get my hair done.

02:36.958 --> 02:39.772
A mayor always has to look her best.

02:39.774 --> 02:42.333
Well, if the mayor wants
to go to the top at 4:00,

02:42.335 --> 02:43.837
we'd better get moving.

14:48.702 --> 14:51.420
is going to be a really fun place?

14:51.422 --> 14:53.371
Well, I thought we could do something

14:53.373 --> 14:55.836
a bit more fun with the concrete.

Now, I need someone to test
out my milkshake creations

15:25.214 --> 15:29.115
and tell me which one is
truly the most shake-tastic.

15:29.117 --> 15:33.339

if something was shake-tastic.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.804
(BOTH SLURPING)

22:43.806 --> 22:45.372
That's it!

22:45.374 --> 22:49.660
That is truly shake-tastic!

22:49.662 --> 22:51.036
What did you put in it, Chef?

22:51.038 --> 22:52.315
Strawberry.

22:52.317 --> 22:55.516
Just plain strawberry.

22:55.518 --> 23:00.828
'Cause sometimes the usual is the best.

23:00.830 --> 23:02.875
BOB: Mmm.

23:02.877 --> 23:05.798
Maybe it needs a touch more vanilla.

23:15.549 --> 23:19.228
I've almost finished putting in
these posts for the new fence, Leo.

23:19.230 --> 23:22.204
Can you finish up while I go
get the wire to connect them?

23:22.206 --> 23:23.580
Sure, Bob.

23:23.582 --> 23:26.107
This big post hammer is ready for whacking.

23:26.109 --> 23:27.898
And I'm ready with the posts.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.020
Right!

23:29.022 --> 23:30.939
Let's start whacking them in.

23:30.941 --> 23:33.690
(CHUCKLING) Hold on. Hold on.

23:33.692 --> 23:37.082
Remember to check that the
posts are the same length

23:37.084 --> 23:39.163
so they're the same height
when they're installed.

23:39.165 --> 23:41.148
Huh, okay. Okay.

23:41.150 --> 23:43.494
This one's a little bit too long.

23:45.116 --> 23:46.811
Now can I start the whacking?

23:46.813 --> 23:48.250
Yes, now can we start?

23:48.252 --> 23:50.523
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

23:50.525 --> 23:53.702
Just be sure they're all the same height.

23:55.421 --> 23:57.371
Ah! There we go.

23:57.373 --> 23:58.779
Now to get whacking.

23:58.781 --> 24:00.795
Whoo-hoo!

24:00.797 --> 24:03.932
Okay. Next one please, Scoop.

24:03.934 --> 24:07.931
We'll have this fence finished in no time.

24:07.933 --> 24:09.852
There we go.

24:09.854 --> 24:11.611
Looking good.

24:11.613 --> 24:12.954
Oh.

24:12.956 --> 24:14.938
This one is taller than that one.

24:14.940 --> 24:18.779
Didn't Bob say you needed to
measure and cut them to size, Leo?

24:18.781 --> 24:21.307
Um, no need to do that.

24:21.309 --> 24:23.557
I'll just give it another whack.

24:25.022 --> 24:27.579
Now it's shorter than all the other posts.

24:27.581 --> 24:30.394
Oh, uh, that's okay.

24:30.396 --> 24:33.114
I'll give all the others a whack too.

24:33.116 --> 24:36.187
(LEO WHACKING)

24:36.189 --> 24:37.883
There we go.

24:37.885 --> 24:39.034
Um...

24:39.036 --> 24:40.506
Leo.

24:40.508 --> 24:41.595
LEO: Oh.

24:41.597 --> 24:44.550
Um, maybe a few more whacks.

24:54.140 --> 24:57.756
Leo, Scoop, what happened
to the posts for the fence?

24:57.758 --> 24:58.747
Uh...

24:58.749 --> 25:02.790
I think I may have gotten
a little carried away.

25:03.901 --> 25:07.738
Yeah, I think you've gone a
little wacky with your whacking.

25:07.740 --> 25:09.306
Look on the bright side.

25:09.308 --> 25:12.165
At least they're all the same height now.

25:18.077 --> 25:19.866
(SQUAWKING)

25:19.868 --> 25:22.267
Should be a simple enough job, Wendy.

25:22.269 --> 25:25.627
New barriers at the entrance to the
town hall and paving for the driveway.

25:25.629 --> 25:28.026
Well, if we're digging
all this old stuff up,

25:28.028 --> 25:30.459
we'll need to attach
Scoop's high-powered breaker.

25:30.461 --> 25:31.739
Yes!

25:31.741 --> 25:34.170
I love having a turn
on the da-da-da-da.

25:34.172 --> 25:37.082
It's a breaker, Scoop, a breaker.

25:37.084 --> 25:39.036
- You really should learn the word.
- MAYOR MADISON: Bob.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.154
Oh.

25:40.156 --> 25:41.434
Mayor Madison.

25:41.436 --> 25:43.483
I want everything looking perfect

25:43.485 --> 25:46.043
for the grand unveiling of the statue.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.867
BOTH: Grand unveiling?

25:47.869 --> 25:49.787
A statue of what, Mayor Madison?

25:49.789 --> 25:51.612
(CLEARS THROAT)

25:51.614 --> 25:54.075
"A statue of the most inventive,

25:54.077 --> 25:55.708
"energetic,

25:55.710 --> 26:00.090
"and forward-thinking person
in Spring City history."

26:00.092 --> 26:03.226
Are we talking about a
statue of you, Mayor Madison?

26:03.228 --> 26:04.859
Yes, we are, Wendy.

26:04.861 --> 26:06.267
How did you guess?

26:06.269 --> 26:11.003
And when it arrives, Bob, I
want you to put it right there.

26:11.005 --> 26:12.539
No problem.

26:12.541 --> 26:14.938
Oh, actually, I'd better
take a photo of you, Mayor,

26:14.940 --> 26:17.467
and send it off to the sculptor.

26:17.469 --> 26:19.910
Or it won't be done in time.

26:24.540 --> 26:29.211
Oh, dear. This thing is so finicky.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.099
Oh, hmm, hmm...

26:31.101 --> 26:33.148
Come on, Mr. Bentley.

26:33.150 --> 26:37.178
I can only hold this smile for so long.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.587
(CLICKS)

26:38.589 --> 26:39.834
Ah, there.

26:39.836 --> 26:41.466
All done.

26:41.468 --> 26:43.717
I think.

26:45.629 --> 26:47.548
There. How does that feel, Scoop?

26:47.550 --> 26:49.019
Perfect!

26:49.021 --> 26:51.131
I love having a turn
on the da-da-da-da.

26:51.133 --> 26:53.850
Scoop, it's called a breaker.

26:53.852 --> 26:56.700
It's easy to remember because
it's good at breaking stuff up.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.787
Oh, I get it now.

26:57.789 --> 26:59.579
Can I start it yet, Bob? Can I start it?

26:59.581 --> 27:01.626
I'm so excited.

27:01.628 --> 27:04.987
Oh, I get nervous when
Scoop gets overexcited.

27:04.989 --> 27:07.802
And he always gets overexcited
when he uses the breaker.

27:07.804 --> 27:09.179
What's the breaker?

27:09.181 --> 27:10.299
The
da-da-da-da.

27:10.301 --> 27:13.435
Nah, da-da-da-da-da
is the da-da-da-da.

27:13.437 --> 27:15.291
No, that's just the noise it makes.

27:15.293 --> 27:16.378
Noise what makes?

27:16.380 --> 27:18.234
The da-da-da...
I mean the breaker.

27:18.236 --> 27:21.765
Uh, look, just try not to
get overexcited, please?

27:25.180 --> 27:27.771
Now, Scoop, you need to dig down

27:27.773 --> 27:30.874
to the level of the string, or the
rainwater won't drain away properly.

27:30.876 --> 27:33.435
- Got it?
- Yep, got it, Bob.

27:33.437 --> 27:36.326
Can I start it up now?
I want to get breaking!

27:37.374 --> 27:40.634
I mean, careful breaking, of course.

27:40.636 --> 27:41.595
Can I?

27:41.597 --> 27:44.091
Please, please, please,
please, please, please?

27:44.093 --> 27:48.155
Okay, Scoop, but only if
you help answer one question.

27:48.157 --> 27:50.043
What's that, Bob?

27:50.045 --> 27:51.963
Can we build it?

27:51.965 --> 27:55.270
ALL: Yes, we can!

We don't need to dig
down to the Earth's core.

28:31.068 --> 28:33.052
Is that far?

28:33.054 --> 28:34.202
BOTH: Whoa!

28:34.204 --> 28:35.898
Look out, Scoop!

28:35.900 --> 28:37.114
I just mean,

28:37.116 --> 28:39.451
be careful with
the da-da-da-da.

28:39.453 --> 28:42.074
Okay, no need to shout.

28:42.076 --> 28:45.222
This is so much fun!

28:48.413 --> 28:51.995
Well, it works, Bob. It's
just not working properly.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.563
- I'll take a look.
- No, no.

28:53.565 --> 28:57.019
I think I know what the problem is.

28:57.021 --> 28:58.971
Twist this knob,

28:58.973 --> 29:01.082
switch the voltage...

29:01.084 --> 29:03.429
Now, Wendy, try it again.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.394
Looking good.

29:06.396 --> 29:09.275
Just needed some Bob magic.

29:09.277 --> 29:11.078
Whoa!

29:12.700 --> 29:16.122
Uh, that might be a little fast?

29:16.124 --> 29:19.429
(CHUCKLES) Actually, maybe some
Wendy magic might be better.

29:22.365 --> 29:24.859
Whoo-hoo! This is the life!

29:24.861 --> 29:26.779
I love my job!

29:26.781 --> 29:29.627
Don't you think you should
slow down a bit, Scoop?

29:29.629 --> 29:31.034
I can't hear you, Muck.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.690
I've got the
da-da-da-da on!

29:33.692 --> 29:36.677
Shouldn't you be taking the rubble away?

29:42.268 --> 29:47.590
Right, now I can get some real
work done without interruptions.

29:51.741 --> 29:54.042
(METAL CLANGS)

29:54.044 --> 29:56.261

30:04.957 --> 30:07.259
Uh, yeah, everything's going fine, Bob.

30:07.261 --> 30:09.787
Just having a breather. (CHUCKLES)

30:09.789 --> 30:12.218
Whew! This digging is hard work, eh?

Well, you're doing a great job.

30:14.749 --> 30:16.826

30:16.828 --> 30:18.586
Hey, did you hear that?

30:18.588 --> 30:19.675
Don't worry, Bob.

30:19.677 --> 30:23.419
It's probably just my hydraulics.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.435
Oh, yeah, nothing to see here.

30:25.437 --> 30:28.250
Well, listen, as a reward
for working so hard,

30:28.252 --> 30:30.906
you can be the first to
test out the new barrier.

30:30.908 --> 30:32.059
Really, Bob?

30:32.061 --> 30:34.042
- That would be... Oh!
- (WATER BUBBLES)

30:34.044 --> 30:36.667
No, Bob, I'd better not.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.907
Uh, there's still a lot to do.

30:38.909 --> 30:41.083
Actually, we're in pretty good shape.

30:41.085 --> 30:42.331
Come on, Scoop.

30:42.333 --> 30:45.371
Everyone deserves a break now and then.

Uh, I've just got something
I need to figure out.

30:48.445 --> 30:50.299
It's, uh...

30:50.301 --> 30:52.059
You go ahead. I'll see you there.

30:52.061 --> 30:55.067

Oh, there go my hydraulics again.

30:58.173 --> 31:00.827

31:00.829 --> 31:02.106
Well, I didn't hear anything.

31:02.108 --> 31:05.637
I'm pretty sure it was.

31:07.420 --> 31:09.306
Oh, Gull.

31:09.308 --> 31:11.675
I didn't listen to anyone,
and now I've sprung a leak

31:11.677 --> 31:14.395
and got to keep it covered up.

31:14.397 --> 31:17.542
Oh, no, Muck's coming.

31:19.837 --> 31:25.211
Actually, maybe Muck can help me.

31:25.213 --> 31:27.451
Anything else for me to get rid of?

31:27.453 --> 31:30.523
Uh, no, not at the moment, Muck.

31:30.525 --> 31:34.298
In fact, you could have a
little rest if you wanted.

31:34.300 --> 31:35.386
I'm fine.

31:35.388 --> 31:37.210
No, you look tired.

31:37.212 --> 31:40.154
Everyone deserves a break now and then.

spot to take five is?

(WATER SPLASHING)

32:04.541 --> 32:07.226
Oh...

32:07.228 --> 32:09.638
Okay, Scoop.

32:14.716 --> 32:16.154
Try it now.

32:16.156 --> 32:18.565
Okay, Wendy.

32:19.677 --> 32:22.822
There's Scoop, coming through!

32:24.604 --> 32:27.227
That was cool!

32:27.229 --> 32:28.987
Can I have another turn?

32:28.989 --> 32:31.034
Of course you can, but we should let

32:31.036 --> 32:33.178
one of the others have a turn first.

32:33.180 --> 32:35.099
Hey, Muck, do you want to have a zoom

32:35.101 --> 32:36.986
through the new automatic barrier?

32:36.988 --> 32:39.845
MUCK: Oh, yes, please, Bob!

32:41.725 --> 32:43.386
Hang on, Muck.

32:43.388 --> 32:45.403
If you're here, then who's...

32:45.405 --> 32:46.778
Who's what, Scoop?

32:46.780 --> 32:49.755
Uh, uh...

32:49.757 --> 32:51.515
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

32:51.517 --> 32:54.116
See you in a minute.

32:55.420 --> 32:57.913
SCOOP: Whoa! Scoop coming through!

32:57.915 --> 33:00.891
Emergency!

33:00.893 --> 33:02.747
Everyone out of the way!

33:02.749 --> 33:04.666
Whoa! Ahhh!

33:04.668 --> 33:07.514
Wahhh!

33:07.516 --> 33:10.150
Oh, no, what happened?

33:11.644 --> 33:14.395
Oh, Scoop, what have you done?

33:14.397 --> 33:18.203
Oh, dear, what have I done?

33:18.205 --> 33:20.218
What a mess.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.851
What are we gonna do now, Bob?

33:21.853 --> 33:24.026
About the leak or the paving slabs?

33:24.028 --> 33:26.010
Well, one thing's for sure.

33:26.012 --> 33:29.626
We're never gonna finish the driveway
in time for the grand opening.

33:29.628 --> 33:31.546
I'm so sorry, Bob.

33:31.548 --> 33:32.698
It's all my fault.

33:32.700 --> 33:35.258
I should've told you about the leak.

33:35.260 --> 33:37.273
Yes, you should have.

33:37.275 --> 33:39.675
But don't worry, Scoop.
We'll think of something.

33:39.677 --> 33:42.235
But the paving slabs are all broken.

33:42.237 --> 33:45.658
They're like puzzle pieces.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.707

39:18.908 --> 39:21.178

No castle is complete without a
portcullis guarding the way in.

repair work to do on the drawbridge too.

39:29.373 --> 39:30.651
You're right, Wendy.

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:05.337
Hmm, let me check.

01:05:05.339 --> 01:05:07.609
Yoo-hoo! Lofty!

01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:09.529
You'll never guess what happened.

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:12.088
I had a super-duper idea...

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:15.384
For me and the Spring City
Rockets to make banners.

01:05:15.386 --> 01:05:19.257
But now we need your help to hang them.

01:05:19.259 --> 01:05:21.785
Oh, I would love to.

01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.576
Marvelous! Come this way.

01:05:23.578 --> 01:05:26.233
So, Lofty, next, I need your help

01:05:26.235 --> 01:05:28.377
to attach one, two supports

01:05:28.379 --> 01:05:29.816
to the back of the frame.

01:05:29.818 --> 01:05:32.600
Uh, Lofty?

01:05:32.602 --> 01:05:34.457
Where'd he go?

01:05:34.459 --> 01:05:35.704
Okay.

01:05:35.706 --> 01:05:40.377
I guess I can start building the
support frames by myself, then.

01:05:40.379 --> 01:05:42.904
Wow! Look at the size of it!

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:45.433
How big is the remote control?

01:05:45.435 --> 01:05:48.537
Actually, this TV doesn't
have a remote control.

01:05:48.539 --> 01:05:51.737
My tablet will pick up a
signal and send it to the TV.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:54.456
Then the TV show appears on-screen.

01:05:54.458 --> 01:05:55.544

01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:23.351
You are so cool for
thinking to make banners.

01:06:26.939 --> 01:06:30.809
