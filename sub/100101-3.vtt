WEBVTT

00:03.169 --> 00:05.046
ELIZABETH:
Well, maybe she got lost.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.214
She didn't.

00:06.297 --> 00:08.383
Says you,
Magellan.

00:08.466 --> 00:09.759
Six floors,
132 rooms,

00:09.843 --> 00:11.428
412 doors.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.388
And one prodigal daughter
returns.

00:13.471 --> 00:14.931
Hi! Sorry I'm late.
Hi.
Hi.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.224
Yes.
This place
is like Hearst Castle.

00:16.306 --> 00:17.434
See?
And I can't stay.

00:17.517 --> 00:20.103
What?
What?

00:20.186 --> 00:21.312
Stevie, you promised that
you would have dinner with us.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.273
I mean, look.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.983
You are not going
to eat and run.

00:25.066 --> 00:28.069
I'm gonna run and eat.
I'm sorry.

00:28.153 --> 00:30.280
We are under water at the Human
Amnesty Association. I mean,

00:30.363 --> 00:32.073
you probably know. There
are beheadings in Riyadh

00:32.156 --> 00:34.117
and political prisoners
in Myanmar.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.243
Versus parents who don't get
to see their daughter

00:35.326 --> 00:36.619
at Pennsylvania Avenue,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.455
it's just...
Ouch.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.331
Look, next time,
I promise,

00:40.415 --> 00:42.292
I will clear the decks.
Fine.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.668
The NIH is cloning
you as we speak.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.086
Your father and I
are having brunch

00:45.170 --> 00:46.796
with your doppelganger
on Sunday, so...

00:46.880 --> 00:48.131
Okay. Love you. Bye.
(chuckles)

00:48.214 --> 00:50.425
Love you.
Bye.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.304
(sighs)

00:54.387 --> 00:56.306
It's finally hitting me, Henry.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.100
We have an empty nest.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.518
Well, there's a remedy for that.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.187
Oh, no.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.272
Lady died, like, nine years ago.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.482
She was irreplaceable.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.649
Those floppy ears.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.276
(chuckles)

01:08.359 --> 01:09.277
She pooped on command.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.820
She did not.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.822
She did once.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.449
Look, you can love
more than one kid.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.659
You can love
more than one dog.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.660
That is such a lousy analogy.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.662
Why?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.456
Because...

01:21.539 --> 01:23.166
I'm the president.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.001
(chuckles)
And, clearly,

01:25.084 --> 01:26.836
the office has honed
your rhetorical skills.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.838
But by that logic,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.840
all the more reason.
People love this stuff.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.634
FDOTUS is a big deal.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.469
We are never calling it FDOTUS.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.472
It's our dog. We can call it
whatever we want.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.307
All right. But the search
has to be low-key, okay?

01:39.390 --> 01:41.309
This is a personal decision.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.145
I don't want some
kind of circus.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.314
MIKE: All dogs over 15 pounds
have merit.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.857
But FDOTUS is America's pet.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.318
So let's look at the polling.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.196
What... polling?

01:53.279 --> 01:55.198
The polling that says
designer breeds

01:55.281 --> 01:58.034
paint you as an elitist,

01:58.117 --> 01:59.160
a perception sorely at odds with
the image that got you elected.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.370
So, nothing
with "doodle"

02:00.453 --> 02:03.206
or "poo" in the name,

02:03.289 --> 02:05.291
or the villagers will be massing
at the gates with torches.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.044
Second no-bark zone's
working breeds.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.711
You can't be seen
as someone who condones

02:09.795 --> 02:12.131
the enslavement
of another species.
MIKE: I don't.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.092
Mm.
So service dogs are off-limits.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.344
That puts the kibosh
on retrievers,

02:16.427 --> 02:17.345
Pomeranians, shepherds.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.347
Pomeranians?

02:19.430 --> 02:20.348
Who do they... service?

02:20.431 --> 02:21.516
The hard of hearing.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.101
They were bred to be yappy.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.644
Not even close to being true.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.272
I know it's a bit over-the-top.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.940
But getting this right matters.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.775
If there were no Checkers,

02:30.859 --> 02:33.403
there never would have been
a Nixon.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.947
Well, that's actually an
argument for not getting a dog.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.408
MIKE: Or choosing
the right one.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.576
We boiled 190 breeds down
to two choices.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.743
Middlebrow.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.289
Gender...

02:44.372 --> 02:45.290
neutral but sprightly.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.417
You're welcome.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.252
A beagle or a
cocker spaniel?

02:49.335 --> 02:51.629
The data has spoken.
Th-This is a puppy,

02:51.713 --> 02:53.256
not a moon landing.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.591
Lady was a bullmastiff.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.801
That's what I want.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.053
I don't...
NINA:
Excuse me, Madam President,

02:59.137 --> 03:01.222
Mr. Jackson,
you're needed in the Sit Room.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.766
Ephraim,
what's going on?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.768
Ma'am, satellite imaging
has just confirmed

03:05.852 --> 03:08.396
that Laszlo Galassy,

03:08.479 --> 03:10.940
the leader of the Knights
of Western Freedom

03:11.024 --> 03:11.941
has been located in Caucasia.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.067
And we're sure it's him?

03:13.151 --> 03:14.611
Yes, ma'am.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.114
The mastermind
behind the murder

03:18.197 --> 03:19.657
of the entire
UN Security Council, including

03:19.741 --> 03:21.534
Ambassador Peter Harriman.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.119
So, after nearly two years
of cat and mouse,

03:23.202 --> 03:24.579
we finally have
a bead on him.

03:24.662 --> 03:28.458
WARE:
For the moment, yes.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.127
(exhales) Galassy is holed up
in a cave complex

03:31.210 --> 03:34.464
in the Caucasus Mountains.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.342
A semiautonomous state
called South Ossetia.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.719
Lawless?
THOMPSON: Lawless enough
that we don't need permission

03:39.802 --> 03:41.471
if we want to target him.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.431
What are our options?
HILL:
The fail-safe

03:43.514 --> 03:44.682
is a laser-guided GBU.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.142
A bunker buster.

03:46.225 --> 03:48.353
Downside?

03:48.436 --> 03:49.979
The large blast radius
will result

03:50.063 --> 03:53.316
in substantial
civilian casualties.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.442
PARKER:
A more surgical
option is to send in

03:54.525 --> 03:55.401
Seal Team Nine.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.320
We should expect

03:57.403 --> 04:00.156
up to half a dozen casualties
on our end.

04:00.239 --> 04:01.282
American military dead abroad.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.200
Not very appealing
either.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.286
HILL:
There is another way.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.997
Fully autonomous
unmanned ground vehicles.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.625
You mean killer robots.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.460
Not the preferred nomenclature,
but yes.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.003
I actually didn't think
that technology was close

04:14.087 --> 04:16.047
to being operational.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.841
HILL:
We caught a break.
Fossor Industries

04:18.925 --> 04:21.386
is beta testing
its autonomous UGVs

04:21.469 --> 04:23.888
at Vaziani base
outside Tbilisi.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.225
This is
a computer simulation.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.519
The UGVs will enter
the cave here.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.396
They'll acquire
their targets using lasers

04:31.479 --> 04:33.064
and infrared technology,

04:33.147 --> 04:34.857
suppress resistance,

04:34.941 --> 04:36.401
then identify
the weakest part

04:36.484 --> 04:37.527
of the cave structure
and bring it down

04:37.610 --> 04:40.405
on the remaining
hostiles.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.824
What about
remotely operated UGVs?

04:42.907 --> 04:44.200
So that we can maintain
human oversight.

04:44.283 --> 04:46.411
Not an option,
Madam President.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.706
The cave walls will
obstruct our comms.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.541
Our intel suggests Russia
hasn't taken steps to...

04:51.624 --> 04:53.584
get involved yet.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.253
But that could change.
Moscow won't like us

04:55.336 --> 04:57.839
in their sphere of influence.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.382
And once Russian troops
are on-site,

04:59.465 --> 05:01.676
we're looking
at a military conflict.

05:01.759 --> 05:02.927
How soon could Russia have
a unit in place?

05:03.011 --> 05:04.387
HILL:
Terrain's remote.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.722
Even if Moscow mobilizes now,

05:05.805 --> 05:07.390
not before morning,

05:07.473 --> 05:09.559
meaning we have
a 24-hour window.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.893
ELIZABETH:
And our options are

05:10.977 --> 05:12.103
civilian casualties,

05:12.186 --> 05:13.771
dead SEALs

05:13.855 --> 05:17.233
or an untested technology

05:17.316 --> 05:18.901
with dangerous implications
for humanity.

05:21.612 --> 05:24.240
Yes, ma'am.

05:24.323 --> 05:27.410
HANSON:
Mr. Moran, did you take leave
of the campaign to attend

05:27.493 --> 05:30.246
your parents' 40th anniversary
party in Martha's Vineyard

05:30.329 --> 05:31.789
with Ms. McCord's
eldest daughter?
Yes.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.416
And no finance laws were broken,

05:33.499 --> 05:36.419
Senator Hanson.
Then why did
the campaign

05:36.502 --> 05:37.920
belatedly reimburse a donor
for your free flight

05:38.004 --> 05:40.381
to the Vineyard?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.383
Senator, this line
of inquiry is well beyond

05:42.467 --> 05:45.928
the Senate Intelligence
Committee's charter

05:46.012 --> 05:47.597
of investigating Iran's meddling
in our presidential election.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.433
The committee's charter,
Counselor,

05:50.516 --> 05:51.476
also entails anything arising
out of that investigation,

05:51.559 --> 05:54.103
which you know,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.105
as Mr. Moran was obviously
prepped for this question.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.441
OLIVIA: A question I will
allow him to answer,

05:58.524 --> 06:00.777
provided he can give
the proper context.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.528
By all means.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.323
We have to go back to...

06:05.406 --> 06:07.450
my on-again,
off-again boyfriend, Trevor.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.619
Things were very much on again.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.787
Wow.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

06:10.870 --> 06:12.080
Petite Auberge?
Well...

06:12.163 --> 06:14.624
Kennedy Center?

06:14.707 --> 06:16.334
If I didn't know you better, I'd
think you were up to something.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.002
Uh, look, Trevor,

06:18.086 --> 06:19.629
we've been in each other's lives
for a long time.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.672
A decade is
long, yes.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.673
And these last seven months
have been really...

06:22.757 --> 06:25.134
meaningful.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.303
Meaningful enough to...

06:27.387 --> 06:30.306
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.
I want to get this right.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.767
Hey. Blake,

06:32.850 --> 06:34.268
this is something I've
wanted for a long time.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.646
Good.
(chuckles)

06:36.729 --> 06:38.523
Then you agree
you should move in.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.817
Oh. You...

06:40.900 --> 06:42.360
You just want me
to move in?

06:42.443 --> 06:44.529
Yeah.

06:44.612 --> 06:45.947
Ah.
And, look,
I made a spreadsheet.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.615
Um, housing costs,
transportation.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.284
You're in finance.
I know that you will see

06:50.368 --> 06:52.161
that the economies of scale
are too great to pass up.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.329
I, uh...

06:53.412 --> 06:55.498
(chuckles):
Wow.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.667
I don't know
what to say.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.127
Well, there's no rush.
I mean, you know, take it home,

06:59.210 --> 07:00.461
crunch the numbers,
do your due diligence...

07:00.545 --> 07:01.963
No, uh, I do know
what to say.

07:02.046 --> 07:04.173
Um...

07:04.257 --> 07:05.383
I guess I was just hoping,

07:05.466 --> 07:09.512
after all this time,

07:09.595 --> 07:10.888
for something more than an
appeal to economies of scale.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.682
Oh, no, it's not just that.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.350
I mean, we're great together.
We have fun.
Yeah.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.685
We like the same...

07:15.768 --> 07:17.353
movies and...
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

07:17.436 --> 07:19.272
...beverages.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.356
Beverages?

07:20.439 --> 07:22.525
I'm bad at this.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.194
You know what,
you're right.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.571
I do need some time
to think about this.

07:26.654 --> 07:27.530
Time alone.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.323
Wait, wait, why?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.492
Because if it took you
this long to come up

07:31.576 --> 07:33.703
with an economic reason
to cohabitate, then we are

07:33.786 --> 07:35.538
miles from an
emotional reason

07:35.621 --> 07:36.873
to do something more--

07:36.956 --> 07:38.708
what's your word?--

07:38.791 --> 07:40.042
meaningful.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
Trevor...
Like get married.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.049
You can't even say it.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.846
I can so say it. It's not...
No, just let it go.

07:51.929 --> 07:53.890
(chuckles)

07:53.973 --> 07:55.141
I will let you know
how the thinking goes.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.893
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't do this.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.354
We're going to the Vineyard
this weekend to meet my folks.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.607
I don't think
that's a good idea.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.734
They're dying to meet you.
Trevor.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.235
I was distraught.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.779
Trevor meant the world to me.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.406
But did I really want to...
marry him?

08:10.489 --> 08:12.575
Mr. Moran...
I mean, I knew
we were compatible.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.452
But marriage is, like, forever.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.579
And... (stammers) I mean,
not that I'm a commitment-phobe.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.748
See, I'm a Gemini,
and I think that...
Sir, this committee is

08:18.831 --> 08:19.916
uninterested
in your romantic misadventures.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.418
OLIVIA:
Senator,

08:22.501 --> 08:24.837
if you insist
on a fishing expedition,

08:24.921 --> 08:26.797
the witness is entitled
to describe the pond.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.674
HANSON:
Get on with it, Mr. Moran.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.177
I'm so sorry. I wanted
to be there more than anything,

08:31.260 --> 08:32.595
but this fund-raiser
in Cupertino was delayed,

08:32.678 --> 08:34.138
and I-I missed
the last flight out.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.597
Well, so, head out
in the morning.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.890
I would, but there are

08:36.974 --> 08:38.392
no direct flights.
I'd be so late.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.269
FRED:
Really disappointing.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.730
EDIE: Especially since we were
so looking forward

08:42.813 --> 08:45.066
to finally meeting
your mystery partner.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.108
We don't even know
this special someone's gender.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.777
Not that it matters.
(chuckles)

08:47.860 --> 08:49.612
We're going to love them.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.948
You notice I said "them,"
even though that's

08:52.031 --> 08:54.075
grammatically incorrect
for our generation.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.576
You're getting off point, dear.
(chuckles)
BLAKE: Don't worry.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.578
We'll reschedule another trip
ASAP.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.747
And I'm sending you the best
red zin you've ever had.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.791
Shelton's coming.
He has a Cessna.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.085
That is a great idea.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.128
Sorry, uh, who's Shelton?

09:06.212 --> 09:08.756
Shelton Anderson. He's a friend
of ours. He lives in Menlo Park.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.633
He's flying out tomorrow.
You can hitch a ride.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.634
What? No, no, no, no.
That'd be a huge inconvenience.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.677
FRED:
Nonsense!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.512
He'll be thrilled.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.305
We will set it up.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.099
We can't wait to see you.
(chuckles)

09:18.182 --> 09:20.184
And them.
No, no, no. Mom...

09:21.769 --> 09:23.604
Hello?

09:23.688 --> 09:24.814
The secretary thanks you
for your continued support.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.567
It was lovely to meet you.
My pleasure.

09:27.650 --> 09:31.654
Hi. Hi. Stevie. Hi.
What?

09:33.072 --> 09:35.658
Your emotional booty call buddy
could use a really big favor.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.327
We have an armed terrorist
bunkered in a cave.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.705
The only surefire way
to protect civilians

09:40.788 --> 09:43.666
and American lives
in this situation

09:43.749 --> 09:45.835
is with autonomous UGVs.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.713
A.I. can operate
at a scale

09:48.796 --> 09:50.840
and speed far beyond
even the most capable

09:50.923 --> 09:53.509
trained human soldier.
It's a quantum leap forward.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.636
That's the problem,
isn't it?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.179
Precipitous deployment
blows right past efforts

09:57.263 --> 09:58.806
to regulate
a new technology.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.642
I thought I'd bring
President Dalton's

10:01.726 --> 10:04.854
former ethics advisor in
for a consultation.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.523
And we all welcome
your perspective, Henry.

10:07.606 --> 10:10.192
But operational imperatives
have to take precedence.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.029
We can worry about ethics later.
HENRY: Oh, come on, Ellen.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.030
History doesn't give us many
examples of that working out.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.573
Yeah, you can't

10:15.656 --> 10:16.824
put that genie back
in the bottle.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.160
It worked with nuclear bombs.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.871
They were deployed
in only one conflict.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.206
And kicked off an arms race
that cost trillions

10:24.290 --> 10:27.835
and made humanity less safe.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.754
Equating smart weapons
with a nuclear stockpile?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.589
At least, with nuclear weapons,
mutually assured destruction

10:31.672 --> 10:34.383
kept the Cold War cold.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.928
But can you imagine
a nuclear weapon

10:38.012 --> 10:41.390
under the control of
an algorithm with no humanity?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.726
A.I. lacks the human judgment
to be able to evaluate

10:43.809 --> 10:45.895
the proportionality
of an attack,

10:45.978 --> 10:47.897
to recognize when a foe
is surrendering.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.733
And human troops lack
the ability

10:50.816 --> 10:52.735
to assess threats
dispassionately.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.570
And unlike robots, they die.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.238
RUSSELL: Good point.
Except smart weapons

10:56.322 --> 10:57.948
aren't engineered
to preserve life,

10:58.032 --> 10:59.867
they're engineered to take it.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.745
That's what slaughterbots do.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.122
HILL:
It's an intentionally term--
we're talking about

11:05.206 --> 11:07.124
microdrones surgically
dispatched to...

11:07.208 --> 11:08.709
to neutralize
high-value targets.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.753
Like political
opponents?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.755
Journalists?
Entire civilian populations?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.757
Come on, Henry, you're
deliberately conjuring

11:14.840 --> 11:16.759
a dystopian nightmare.
Well, what would you call

11:16.842 --> 11:19.804
thousands of robots using

11:19.887 --> 11:21.931
facial recognition technology
to hunt down and kill

11:22.014 --> 11:23.599
human beings?
Same thing I'd call
an aircraft carrier

11:23.682 --> 11:25.393
or a nuclear submarine--

11:25.476 --> 11:27.228
a deterrent.
Plus,

11:27.311 --> 11:29.605
the only defense
against a swarm

11:29.688 --> 11:31.440
of robots is a
more advanced swarm

11:31.524 --> 11:33.734
of robots,
which is why

11:33.818 --> 11:35.778
we can't fall behind.
WARE:
A.I. is the tool

11:35.861 --> 11:39.281
that makes the
world safer

11:39.365 --> 11:41.242
by obviating the need for
conventional weapons or troops.

11:41.325 --> 11:45.037
SUSAN:
That's not safety.
That is a new kind

11:45.121 --> 11:47.790
of danger, which is why
Pakistan, South America

11:47.873 --> 11:50.793
and most African nations
are already

11:50.876 --> 11:51.669
begging the U.N.
to stop this in its tracks.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.755
ELIZABETH:
And...

11:54.839 --> 11:56.465
we can't assume that
only moral actors

11:56.549 --> 11:57.842
are going to
have access

11:57.925 --> 12:00.803
to smart weapons.
Exactly.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.972
Microdrones can be
cheaply mass-produced,

12:03.055 --> 12:06.058
outfitted with C-4,
bioagents,

12:06.142 --> 12:07.643
and once they get
into the wrong hands...
HENRY: Which they will,

12:07.726 --> 12:09.145
'cause they can be spoofed,
they can be hacked.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.438
HILL:
The technology

12:10.521 --> 12:12.356
is inevitable.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.859
Which is why we have
the obligation

12:14.942 --> 12:16.485
to get there first.
To make sure

12:16.569 --> 12:18.904
that we develop
ethical versions

12:18.988 --> 12:21.532
before the unethical versions
come out.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.826
Ethical killer robots-- really?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.328
WARE:
All due respect
to the Cassandras among us,

12:26.412 --> 12:28.164
ma'am, we're not
talking about a...

12:28.247 --> 12:32.042
a drone army today.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.004
We're contemplating
a few autonomous weapons

12:35.087 --> 12:37.715
whose deployment will
spare American lives.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.300
It's never long
before "few" becomes "many."

12:39.383 --> 12:40.509
Susan,
where are we

12:40.593 --> 12:41.802
on a smart weapons treaty?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.679
The same place we were

12:43.762 --> 12:46.849
in the Dalton administration--
with Russia

12:46.932 --> 12:49.685
and China dragging
their feet.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.563
While they pour
billions into R&D.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.857
So an arms race
among the three superpowers...

12:54.940 --> 12:57.026
is already upon us,
whether we want it or not.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.862
And the thing about arms races

12:59.945 --> 13:01.864
is you want to win them.
HENRY:
We've already outlawed

13:01.947 --> 13:03.824
chemical weapons,
lasers that blind,

13:03.908 --> 13:06.660
neutron bombs...

13:06.744 --> 13:08.871
Negotiating a ban takes time.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.874
Yeah, well, there's
the rub, Henry-- time.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.543
If Fossor has perfected
this technology,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.837
how long before a Chinese
or Russian contractor does?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.881
HILL:
And if Russia or China
beat us to the punch,

13:18.964 --> 13:20.925
we will never get
them to the table.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.676
This isn't just about
bringing to justice

13:22.760 --> 13:25.179
one terrorist
who attacked

13:25.262 --> 13:26.764
the U.N. Security Council,
ma'am. A-A...

13:26.847 --> 13:29.016
As imperative as that goal is,

13:29.099 --> 13:30.601
it's about
protecting America

13:32.978 --> 13:35.022
while we still can.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.742
♪ ♪

13:46.825 --> 13:48.077
I just don't want to do this
right now.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.286
You've been pacing back
and forth the past hour.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.412
You're the one
who once told me

13:50.496 --> 13:52.915
you think better
when you multitask.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.999
Well, I was probably distracted
when I said that.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.876
Behold Delilah,

13:55.960 --> 13:58.087
straight from a championship
bloodline in Newcastle.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.714
My goodness.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.925
What a beaut.
She's beautiful.
Her mom won Best in Show

14:03.008 --> 14:04.802
at Westminster-- you're
in the presence of royalty.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.554
She just...

14:06.637 --> 14:07.763
looks so sad.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.974
You know, she needs
a little time to acclimate

14:10.057 --> 14:11.725
after being separated from
her mom and her litter mates.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.395
What?
I meant...

14:14.478 --> 14:17.356
lovingly conveyed
to her forever home.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.900
Mike... how old
is that puppy?

14:19.984 --> 14:22.945
Four, six weeks.
My God,

14:23.028 --> 14:24.947
she's pining for her mother
and her litter mates?

14:25.030 --> 14:25.948
You can't...
Antidepressants.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.117
Wha...

14:28.200 --> 14:29.660
It works for the polar
bears in Central Park.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.787
Perk 'em right up.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.832
No. No. No.
(Delilah whimpering)

14:34.915 --> 14:36.834
That puppy is going
back to her mother

14:36.917 --> 14:39.628
and her litter mates,
unmedicated.

14:39.712 --> 14:40.921
Mike, don't even...
Don't open your mou...

14:41.005 --> 14:42.339
Dah.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.258
(Delilah panting)
My God.

14:44.341 --> 14:45.801
Okay, Senator Rowland--
he breeds English sheepdogs,

14:45.884 --> 14:46.927
and he's a swing vote.

14:48.512 --> 14:50.472
Take her home.
Right away.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.765
I'm supposed to find
a dog that's...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.438
an only child?

14:57.521 --> 15:00.149
The president's daughter joined
you on a cross-country flight

15:00.232 --> 15:01.984
with the head of a PAC that
doled out eight million dollars

15:02.067 --> 15:03.068
in support of candidates

15:03.152 --> 15:05.321
during the last election cycle.
Yes.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.657
At any point, did you ask

15:08.741 --> 15:10.159
Mr. Anderson to donate
to Secretary McCord's campaign?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.327
No.
Did Stevie McCord?

15:11.410 --> 15:14.997
Hardly.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.708
Stevie and... and Mr. Anderson
didn't exactly hit it off.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.294
SHELTON:
Look, all I'm saying

15:20.377 --> 15:21.503
is the country's not ready
for a female president.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.799
It's too polarizing an idea.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.801
That is what they said about
giving women the vote, about...

15:27.885 --> 15:31.013
letting them be in combat...

15:31.096 --> 15:32.681
I mean, glass ceilings are meant
to be shattered, Mr. Anderson.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.351
Someday. Maybe.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.518
With someone
who's a bit more... likeable.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.520
(laughs):
Excuse me?

15:38.604 --> 15:40.189
Plus, she's never run
for anything.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.650
Now she's suddenly
gonna find the energy

15:42.733 --> 15:43.692
to crisscross the country
for months?

15:43.776 --> 15:44.902
She'll wilt by summer.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.737
Guaranteed.
Okay.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.113
Uh, first of all...
Frosé.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.657
Uh...
Yes. Excuse us.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.241
(whispers):
It's a party.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.368
No fighting.
I only need five
minutes with him.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.204
It'll be a very
short fight.

15:55.287 --> 15:57.581
My folks are freed up.
It's time to meet Fred and Edie.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.249
Just smile, let me do
the talking. Mom, Dad.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.542
This is Stevie McCord.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.378
Hi.
Elizabeth McCord's

16:02.461 --> 16:03.671
daughter?
Yes.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.214
Very nice to
meet you. Hi.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.715
No wonder you
didn't tell us.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.843
This is big news.
BLAKE: Well, not that big...

16:09.927 --> 16:11.887
Blake mentioned
a mystery partner months ago.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.222
Oh.
Oh.
So you must be
very far down the road.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.682
FRED: Edie, Edie... (laughs)
As you know,

16:14.765 --> 16:16.100
your dad and I
moved in together

16:16.183 --> 16:17.434
after two months and four...

16:17.518 --> 16:18.727
five days.
Five-five days.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.062
When you know, you know.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.563
So do you know?

16:21.647 --> 16:22.856
Oh. I, no...
You know what?

16:22.940 --> 16:25.192
Why don't you guys
do a song?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.652
No, no, we're gonna wait till
after dessert. A grand finale.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.569
Nothing beats a prologue.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.905
Come on.
Well, what do you think?

16:29.988 --> 16:31.907
All right.
Sure, okay.
Hey, everyone,

16:31.990 --> 16:33.075
our son wants us
to do a ditty.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.910
What do you say?

16:34.993 --> 16:36.787
(indistinct shouts)

16:36.870 --> 16:38.163
Right?
All right.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.874
FRED:
Okay.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.086

16:44.169 --> 16:47.965

16:48.048 --> 16:50.259

17:09.069 --> 17:11.446
(plays a flourish)

17:11.530 --> 17:12.656
GUESTS: Aw.
MAN: Bravo!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.450
EDIE:
Thank you!

17:14.532 --> 17:16.785
(clanking)

17:16.868 --> 17:17.911
ELIZABETH:
Peter.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.329
Hey.

17:19.413 --> 17:20.789
It's good to see you.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.999
Same.
I didn't know

17:22.082 --> 17:23.125
you were a car guy.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.334
Hell yeah.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.294
Yeah.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.171
And this one--

17:27.253 --> 17:29.298
she's gonna be transporting
precious cargo.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.300
My kids.

17:31.383 --> 17:34.428
Brooke and Kevin.
We're going on a long trip.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.804
Got to make sure
every lug nut is tight.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.640
Be a sport.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.767
Hand me the dingus
out of that tool chest.

17:39.850 --> 17:40.809
The what?

17:40.893 --> 17:42.853
The doohickey.
Oh.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.354
A doohickey.
What's a doohickey?

17:44.438 --> 17:45.439
You know.

17:45.522 --> 17:46.815
The thingamabob.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.983
Come on.
I'm running late, here.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.319
I'll look it up.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.822
I'll-I'll look it up.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.824
No, Henry. What?
What? What?

17:55.908 --> 17:56.658
Hey. Listen.
(sighs)

17:56.742 --> 17:59.036
(grunts)

17:59.119 --> 18:00.662
I had a dream about
Peter Harriman.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.872
(grunts)

18:01.955 --> 18:03.832
Yeah?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.000
He was fixing a car.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.169
Mm.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.297
Going on a trip
with his family.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.675
And he asked me
for a tool,

18:13.759 --> 18:14.718
but I... I didn't know
which one he meant.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.095
I couldn't work my phone.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.096
Again with the phone.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.723
I mean, come on...
Not about the phone.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.683
He was right there
in front of me.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.686
It was so real.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.604
Well, you're trying to bring
his killer to justice.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.357
It makes sense.

18:28.440 --> 18:32.027
Why was he talking
to me about his kids?

18:33.111 --> 18:34.988
Because the justice
would be for his family.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.532
And-and the car?
And the tools?

18:36.615 --> 18:38.992
What does that mean?
Well, maybe you're looking

18:39.076 --> 18:40.160
for the right instrument
to get the job done.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.871
I don't know.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.375
Or maybe it's about

18:46.458 --> 18:50.212
machines needing
human oversight.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.713
Or maybe it's about the pint
of rocky road that you ate.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.215
(grunts)
Half pint

18:53.298 --> 18:55.843
of rocky road.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.511
Symbolism there, too.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.721
Half pint.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.098
You know what
that means.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.766
Mm-hmm.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.519
There's more left.
Yeah.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.897
So... Okay. Go ahead.
Okay.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.400
HILL:
We have a B-2

19:11.483 --> 19:13.527
with the GBU payload
circling the target.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.654
SEAL Team Nine
is at the ready,

19:22.786 --> 19:24.788
and the autonomous
UGVs are in situ.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.916
Madam President?

19:28.000 --> 19:29.793
The B-2 can stand down.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.795
I'm not prepared
to inflict casualties

19:31.879 --> 19:33.714
on an innocent
civilian population.

19:33.797 --> 19:34.882
Well, I'd like to know
where people

19:34.965 --> 19:36.550
land on this.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.594
Ed?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.262
Autonomous UGVs.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.722
HILL:
I'm for any option

19:41.805 --> 19:44.016
that protects our troops.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.393
UGVs.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.770
UGVs.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.482
SEALs.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.777
Russell?

19:56.987 --> 19:58.447
I'm convinced the risks of
this tech outweigh the benefits.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.283
SEAL team.

20:01.366 --> 20:04.786
Well, I appreciate
the input. Thank you.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.747
And I don't dismiss the need
to protect our troops.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.124
But there are
good reasons

20:09.207 --> 20:12.085
why successive administrations

20:12.169 --> 20:14.880
have sought a preemptive ban
on autonomous weapons.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.049
Deploying them now
will have consequences

20:19.051 --> 20:22.804
we're only beginning
to grapple with.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.848
We have the finest military
in history.

20:24.932 --> 20:26.934
Let's use it.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.185
Alpha 1,
it's a go.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.398
SEAL TEAM LEADER:
Copy that, Admiral.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.279
(quietly):
Go, go, go.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.406
No comms
until they exit the cave.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.125
So now we wait.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.961
Base, this is Alpha 1.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.045
Target has been neutralized.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.340
We have a dozen captives
in custody.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.969
SEAL team remains
at full capacity.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.345
Copy that, Alpha 1.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.347
We're gonna do
an aerial recon to sweep

21:05.430 --> 21:06.807
for any kind
of remaining resistance. Then...

21:06.890 --> 21:08.225
(boom)

21:08.308 --> 21:09.685
ELIZABETH:
What's going on?
Ed, what's happening?

21:14.189 --> 21:15.607
Switch to Camera C.

21:20.487 --> 21:23.365
(explosion)

21:23.448 --> 21:25.575
At 9:14 a.m.
Eastern Daylight time,

21:25.659 --> 21:28.203
President McCord
deployed a SEAL Team

21:28.286 --> 21:30.205
in the Caucasus Mountain
region to neutralize

21:30.288 --> 21:32.541
Laszlo Galassy, mastermind

21:32.624 --> 21:35.711
of last year's deadly
sarin gas attack at the U.N.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.546
The mission was a success,
but during the operation,

21:37.629 --> 21:39.089
eight members of SEAL Team Nine
were killed,

21:39.172 --> 21:41.883
and six others were injured

21:41.967 --> 21:44.511
by a shoulder-launched
surface-to-air missile.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.054
The nation mourns their loss.
(reporters clamoring)

21:46.138 --> 21:47.431
Was Russia apprised
of the operation?

21:47.514 --> 21:49.182
No. Frank.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.892
I understand the president
was given the option

21:50.976 --> 21:52.519
of using fully
autonomous weapons

21:52.602 --> 21:53.562
instead of sending in troops.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.231
Is that true?

21:56.314 --> 21:57.733
You know I can't comment
about operational matters.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.568
What was President
McCord's rationale

21:59.651 --> 22:01.695
for putting troops
in harm's way instead?

22:01.778 --> 22:04.114
Please answer the question.
(reporters clamoring)

22:04.197 --> 22:06.074
(door opens)

22:06.158 --> 22:08.535
Someone leaked our
smart weapons deliberations.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.078
There were a limited number
of people in that room.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.205
All of whom probably
read in their subordinates.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.750
We're gonna
have to cast a wider net.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.461
Get Director Banks on it.
Yes, ma'am.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.588
And when I find out which
son of a bitch leaked this...

22:19.671 --> 22:22.591
A more pressing issue
is the next of kin.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.509
I don't want them thinking
that I jeopardized

22:24.593 --> 22:25.635
their loved ones
unnecessarily.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.429
I wouldn't be too concerned
about that.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.556
You have
a well-earned reputation

22:29.639 --> 22:30.724
for safeguarding human life.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.267
I'm not worried
about my reputation,

22:32.350 --> 22:34.436
I'm worried about the bereaved.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.897
I want to meet with them
as soon as possible, okay?

22:36.980 --> 22:39.441
Yes, ma'am.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.234
You know, we might also have

22:41.318 --> 22:43.695
a diplomatic opening here.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.989
Public disclosure
of our ability

22:46.073 --> 22:48.116
to deploy autonomous weapons

22:48.200 --> 22:49.910
could finally bring Russia

22:49.993 --> 22:52.662
and China to the table
over a ban.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.581
We may be in luck.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.333
WTO's in town this week.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.667
Well, let's get
Secretary Thompson

22:57.751 --> 22:59.711
to backchannel with Chen

23:02.464 --> 23:04.466
and Avdonin.
Thank you.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.387
(door closes)

23:09.471 --> 23:11.139
This has been asked
and answered, Senator,

23:11.223 --> 23:12.641
several times.
SENATOR HANSON:
And I find it impossible

23:12.724 --> 23:15.310
to believe that at no time

23:15.394 --> 23:17.646
did the secretary's daughter,
who joined her campaign

23:17.729 --> 23:19.648
only a week earlier,
have a heart-to-heart

23:19.731 --> 23:21.775
with one of this country's
most important bundlers.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.862
They did have a
heart-to-heart.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.614
I suspected as much.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.617
Continue.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.744
Third-party candidacies
are a colossal waste of time.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.121
Pointless spoilers.

23:34.204 --> 23:35.831
The historical record
is undeniable.

23:35.914 --> 23:36.998
Lincoln was a
third-party candidate.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.667
Yes, he was.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.002
And look what happened
to him.
That's...

23:41.086 --> 23:41.962
(chuckling):
Excuse me?

23:42.045 --> 23:43.964
You love your mother.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.841
And, uh, that's endearing.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.134
But facts are facts,
sweetheart.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.261
(chuckles)

23:49.344 --> 23:51.012
First of all, I'm not
your sweetheart.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.348
Easy.
I didn't mean to...

23:53.431 --> 23:55.892
To what-- to traffic
in stereotypes,

23:55.976 --> 23:57.686
like this country's not ready
for a female president?

23:57.769 --> 23:59.729
Or that women are unlikable.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.690
Or that my mom, who was
secretary of state

24:01.773 --> 24:04.860
for five years,
and before that

24:04.943 --> 24:05.944
she was a-a top CIA operative,
all while raising three kids,

24:06.027 --> 24:09.573
but-but she...

24:09.656 --> 24:11.741
she just doesn't have
the energy for a man's job.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.035
No need to get bent
out of shape.
Sure. Yeah.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.537
I mean. implying that my
mother's gonna be assassinated.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.705
why would that offend me,
Dessert's up.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.917
do you think?
I don't know.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.717
(chuckles)

24:28.800 --> 24:31.595
Good afternoon. Uh...

24:31.678 --> 24:34.181
thank you for agreeing
to meet with me.

24:34.264 --> 24:37.225
I can only imagine

24:37.309 --> 24:39.769
how difficult
this moment must be.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.230
I wanted

24:42.314 --> 24:44.524
to thank each of you,
personally

24:49.529 --> 24:51.072
for your sacrifice.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.533
Tell me about your loved one.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.873
Lieutenant John Marshall.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.376
Thank you for your sacrifice,
Mrs. Marshall.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.213
And yours?

25:06.296 --> 25:08.798
My twin brother.
Master at Arms

25:08.882 --> 25:11.259
First Class,
Danny Fitzpatrick.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.762
He was my best friend and I
still owed him 50 bucks.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.931
Thank you.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.433
My son.

25:18.516 --> 25:20.769
Chief Special Warfare Operator

25:20.852 --> 25:22.604
Oscar Diaz.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.522
He loved the Yankees.

25:24.606 --> 25:28.193
And the ladies.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.153
(chuckling): He was learning
Swedish 'cause he said

25:30.237 --> 25:34.199
the girls over there were...

25:36.284 --> 25:37.786
amazing.
(chuckles)

25:37.869 --> 25:40.413
I just wanted to say...

25:40.497 --> 25:43.500
Well, I wanted to assure you

25:43.583 --> 25:45.252
that their sacrifice
was not in vain.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.795
They were heroes,

25:46.878 --> 25:48.421
Madam President.
Wh-Why do you need to tell us

25:48.505 --> 25:51.049
they didn't die in vain?

25:51.132 --> 25:52.467
Because I know
what's being reported.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.262
That...

25:55.345 --> 25:57.472
smart weapons
could have spared them.

25:57.555 --> 25:58.807
MARSHALL:
They weren't trying
to be spared.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.933
They were trying
to do their duty.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.310
It's what they
signed up for.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.187
DIAZ:
What they deserve

26:04.271 --> 26:06.773
is a president
who stands up publicly

26:06.856 --> 26:07.774
for their sacrifice.
FITZPATRICK:
And doesn't apologize for it.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.151
ELIZABETH:
I haven't. I...

26:10.235 --> 26:11.695
DIAZ:
No, ma'am. Due respect.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.114
You've done something worse.

26:14.197 --> 26:15.282
You've stayed silent

26:15.365 --> 26:16.658
as your critics
have made it seem

26:16.741 --> 26:18.785
like this mission was a mistake.

26:18.868 --> 26:20.829
MARSHALL:
But it wasn't a mistake.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.289
An evil man was brought
to justice, right?

26:22.372 --> 26:24.499
(people murmuring in agreement)

26:24.582 --> 26:25.709
They did that.

26:27.877 --> 26:31.006
Yes, they did.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.675
I am so grateful
for your bravery,

26:33.758 --> 26:36.469
and the bravery
of your loved ones.

26:36.553 --> 26:40.015
Thank you.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.182
Absolute...
Madam President.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.851
This is a surprise.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.060
We were expecting
Secretary Thompson.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.812
Well, I decided to step in.

26:45.895 --> 26:48.732
That's problematic.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.859
As you're aware, there is
a protocol we subvert

26:50.942 --> 26:51.735
by parleying
directly with you.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.863
I know.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.073
I also know that even
with inducements,

26:57.157 --> 26:59.200
President Li
and President Salnikov

26:59.284 --> 27:02.412
would decline to discuss

27:02.495 --> 27:04.414
meaningful limits
on autonomous weapons.

27:04.497 --> 27:06.541
We're not authorized to...

27:06.624 --> 27:08.084
have this discussion...

27:08.168 --> 27:09.878
I just need you to listen

27:09.961 --> 27:11.880
and run my proposal
up the flag pole.

27:11.963 --> 27:15.008
Okay?

27:15.091 --> 27:16.760
What are the contours of
the agreement you are seeking?

27:16.843 --> 27:18.928
A complete and total ban.

27:19.012 --> 27:22.223
(laughing)

27:22.307 --> 27:24.684
There are strong
moral arguments here.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.770
But I do think that we likely

27:26.853 --> 27:29.731
will find more common ground
in the practicalities.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.358
We're all going to spend

27:31.441 --> 27:33.276
billions of dollars
on this arms race.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.778
Drive up our national debts,

27:34.861 --> 27:36.905
mortgage our children's futures.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.908
Forgive my cynicism,

27:39.991 --> 27:42.243
but this is a propitious time
for your government

27:42.327 --> 27:44.079
to push for such a ban,
isn't it?

27:44.162 --> 27:46.122
CHEN:
Yes. Now that you've

27:46.206 --> 27:49.250
achieved operational capability,

27:49.334 --> 27:51.628
you're looking to lock in
your strategic advantage.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.588
Strategic advantage
i-is an illusion.

27:53.671 --> 27:55.757
If nuclear weapons
taught us anything,

27:55.840 --> 27:59.761
it's that no country
can win an arms race.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.137
I trust you both remember
the madness of that one.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.765
We see a U.S.
president

28:03.848 --> 28:05.392
in domestic trouble,

28:05.475 --> 28:07.143
trying to use us

28:07.227 --> 28:09.312
to gain
political capital.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.356
This is not about my presidency,

28:11.439 --> 28:13.942
for God's sake.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.778
Ming. Konstantin.
Look, e-even

28:16.861 --> 28:19.572
if you like the idea
of autonomous weapons,

28:19.656 --> 28:21.991
what happens

28:22.075 --> 28:23.243
when a hacker encodes a virus

28:23.326 --> 28:25.453
to turn them on Beijing?

28:25.537 --> 28:28.623
Moscow, or Washington.

28:28.706 --> 28:31.793
The whole point
of smart weapons

28:31.876 --> 28:33.920
is that we cede control.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.630
And if we cede control,

28:35.713 --> 28:37.507
they're our ticket to oblivion.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.135
An existential threat

28:40.218 --> 28:42.929
with no room for error,
no way back.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.806
But there is a way out,
if we work together.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.850
CHEN:
And if we choose not

28:46.933 --> 28:48.852
to come to the table?
Well, I intend

28:48.935 --> 28:50.520
to give an address
from the Oval Office tonight.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.481
To announce what?

28:53.565 --> 28:56.317
Either that the three
superpowers have agreed

28:56.401 --> 28:59.654
on a comprehensive ban
on autonomous weapons

28:59.737 --> 29:01.656
or that my government
if plowing $30 billion

29:01.739 --> 29:03.950
in R&D to deploy them.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.161
You're bluffing.
Your bosses

29:13.585 --> 29:16.129
have five hours to get back
to me with an answer.

29:16.212 --> 29:19.424
RUSSELL:
An Oval Office address.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.842
It's bold.
It's brave.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.677
You think it'll backfire.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.679
I think you seem to feel

29:24.762 --> 29:26.514
an overwhelming need to...

29:26.598 --> 29:28.016
explain yourself.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.351
Isn't that a
president's job?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.561
A president's job is to lead,

29:31.644 --> 29:33.521
with strength.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.523
Not to appeal to be understood

29:35.607 --> 29:37.525
or-or supported.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.194
Well, you put it that way,

29:39.277 --> 29:41.988
feels like the old patriarchy

29:42.071 --> 29:43.573
telling me to do things the way
they've always been done.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.533
By men.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.745
I don't know how to communicate

29:53.625 --> 29:55.877
without you hearing
those things.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.212
Try advising me as a president

29:57.295 --> 29:58.880
and not as a woman.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.550
Point taken.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.886
I have a second critique.
(chuckles)

30:04.969 --> 30:07.889
Talking about smart weapons?

30:07.972 --> 30:09.265
Y-You are about
to scare the crap

30:09.349 --> 30:11.184
out of the American public.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.186
And presidents who do that--

30:13.269 --> 30:15.772
typically-- are not popular

30:15.855 --> 30:18.775
and are not effective.

30:18.858 --> 30:22.362
Russell, do you...
do you agree

30:22.445 --> 30:23.738
that autonomous
warfare poses

30:23.821 --> 30:24.781
a serious threat
to humanity?

30:24.864 --> 30:27.951
Yes.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.744
And that it's a president's job
to concern herself

30:29.827 --> 30:31.204
with such things?
Yes.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.206
Well, then, for today,

30:33.289 --> 30:35.083
I won't worry about
being popular

30:35.166 --> 30:36.751
or effective.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.836
I'll worry about
being presidential.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.923
(soft chuckle)

30:42.006 --> 30:44.759
I'll have drafts of, uh...

30:44.842 --> 30:46.886
two different speeches
for your review

30:48.513 --> 30:51.391
in the next 90 minutes.

30:51.474 --> 30:54.769
HANSON:
It comes down to this,
Mr. Moran. Were you aware

30:54.852 --> 30:56.771
that two weeks after you met
Mr. Anderson, his PAC donated

30:56.854 --> 30:57.939
half a million dollars
to an outside

30:58.022 --> 31:00.900
dark money group

31:00.984 --> 31:03.111
supporting the secretary
coast to coast?
Ye... Uh, yes.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.488
Everyone on the campaign was.
It was a big deal.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.448
And a mere two days
after that windfall,

31:07.532 --> 31:10.118
you and Stevie McCord
belatedly chose

31:10.201 --> 31:11.578
to reimburse Mr. Anderson
for use of his private plane.

31:11.661 --> 31:12.829
Right?
That's correct.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.289
Why would you reimburse him

31:14.372 --> 31:16.124
if you're not soliciting him

31:16.207 --> 31:19.502
to donate to your candidate?
Because we wanted

31:19.586 --> 31:21.963
to avoid even the appearance
of impropriety.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.298
Because you knew it was
an in-kind campaign donation.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.966
That's not true.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.302
Which you only declared
after the target

31:27.385 --> 31:30.471
of your solicitation
cut you a check.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.473
Proof you were trying to bypass
campaign finance laws.

31:32.557 --> 31:33.808
That's also not true.

31:33.891 --> 31:35.768
Laws you also broke

31:35.852 --> 31:36.978
by illegally coordinating
with his PAC.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.022
Senator,
you are free

31:39.105 --> 31:41.774
to refer these matters
to the FEC,

31:41.858 --> 31:43.651
but you have Mr. Moran's answer.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.945
HANSON:
Yes. And I need him
to answer this, too.

31:46.029 --> 31:48.906
If the purpose
of your interactions

31:48.990 --> 31:50.033
with Mr. Anderson
was not fundraising,

31:50.116 --> 31:52.827
why did you send this text

31:52.910 --> 31:55.163
to the president's daughter
during your parents' party?

31:55.246 --> 31:58.124
And I quote:
"You have to butter up Shelton."

31:58.207 --> 32:00.793
Simple.
He was our ride back.

32:00.877 --> 32:01.919
Hey. Would you please
just apologize?
No. No! I will not.

32:02.003 --> 32:02.920
We have an event
in L.A. tomorrow.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.631
It's gonna be a long walk
from the vineyard.
I hate

32:04.714 --> 32:05.840
this whole entitled

32:05.923 --> 32:07.842
crustacean-obsessed colony.

32:07.925 --> 32:09.677
I only came here because
it was a favor to you.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.680
How is making a scene a favor?

32:12.764 --> 32:14.974
STEVIE:
I was defending
my mother, the person

32:15.058 --> 32:18.227
that you work for.
Remember, Blake?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.523
Ooh. What the hell
is going on with her?
Yeah.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.650
We love her.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.027
(door opens)

32:26.110 --> 32:27.654
I present Goddess,
which is not very
ELIZABETH: Oh.

32:27.737 --> 32:28.863
of the people,
so before we go to press,

32:28.946 --> 32:30.239
we should probably change it
to something

32:30.323 --> 32:32.033
like Goddess of the People.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.701
She is a looker.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.870
And with a daily grooming
and vitamin regimen,

32:35.953 --> 32:37.914
she will stay that way.
Seems like
a lot of work.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.082
Not for you.
Well, still,

32:39.165 --> 32:42.877
I don't know if
I'm comfortable

32:42.960 --> 32:44.337
with a dog who spends more
time on her hair than I do.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.214
She's not really

32:46.297 --> 32:49.050
a "rolling around
on the lawn" type.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.885
I agree. More of a "fetching
a vote on the floor" type.
Well,

32:50.968 --> 32:53.930
I appreciate that, Mike.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.932
But we are going to want
to have a relationship

32:56.015 --> 32:57.558
with the animal.
Well, she's very relatable.
Why don't you try

32:57.642 --> 32:58.559
communicating with her
before you decide she's icy.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.396
Well...

33:01.479 --> 33:03.356
(barks, growling)
Whoa, whoa! Goddess. Goddess.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.567
I think she senses
your hostility.

33:06.651 --> 33:10.238
Or she's an overbred,
tightly-wound bitch.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.572
Once she realizes you're alpha,
she will fall into line.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.032
I'm already trying to convince

33:13.116 --> 33:15.368
China and Russia
that I'm the alpha.

33:15.451 --> 33:17.120
I don't want to have to
worry about it with my dog.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.414
She's not a fit.
Everybody wants

33:19.497 --> 33:21.374
a Gordon.
There was only one.

33:21.457 --> 33:22.375
I know.
I'll keep looking.

33:22.458 --> 33:26.254
Thank you.
(Goddess barking)

33:26.337 --> 33:27.964
Two speeches, Madam
President, as promised.

33:28.047 --> 33:30.091
Daisy.
Still no word

33:30.174 --> 33:31.300
from Beijing
or Moscow?

33:31.384 --> 33:32.885
Nope.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.513
And the clock is ticking.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.390
Multibillion-dollar
arms race,

33:37.473 --> 33:38.725
comprehensive ban treaty.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.269
I mean, I...

33:41.352 --> 33:42.311
I'm used to things
coming down to the wire,

33:42.395 --> 33:44.772
but wow.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.358
Well, you damn sure
have enough on your plate.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.737
I need to bring this
to your attention.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.159
(sighs)

33:56.242 --> 33:57.785
This is the leaker?

33:57.869 --> 34:00.663
Yeah.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.415
I want to see him
as soon as possible.

34:02.498 --> 34:05.585
Thought you would.
He's on the way.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.295
Oh, my God. Hey.
(blows kiss)

34:07.378 --> 34:09.797
Meet FDOTUS, a mutt

34:09.880 --> 34:13.259
of indeterminate age
and ancestry.
Hi.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.428
She's got no papers,
no Instagram feed.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.472
(laughs)
And she can't do
a single trick, can you?

34:17.554 --> 34:19.474
I'll let you break it to Mike.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.184
Oh.
Oh, good girl.
Oh, good girl.

34:21.266 --> 34:22.310
Well, how did you
do this so quickly?

34:22.393 --> 34:25.146
What do you mean?

34:25.228 --> 34:27.690
Well...
I walked to the shelter
in Dupont Circle,

34:27.774 --> 34:29.692
and FDOTUS practically
jumped in my lap.
Come here.

34:29.775 --> 34:31.360
Didn't you, buddy?
Oh, she's perfect.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.321
Mm, isn't she?
I don't like the
name, though.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.032
That's silly.
Well, that'll come.

34:36.114 --> 34:37.241
Hi. Hi.
Okay, I'm gonna leave
you guys to get acquainted.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.034
Oh, okay.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.661
(chuckles):
Hi.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.456
Whoa! Oh.
Come on,
go play with Mama.

34:43.539 --> 34:45.666
I'm afraid she imprinted
on me a little bit.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.335
That's okay.
All right.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.462
But you'll definitely
be her human.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.047
We'll bond later.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.882
It's been a long day, Senator.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.511
Are we about done here?
Just a moment.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.513
Yes. Here it is.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.349
(whispers): I have to pee.
Mr. Moran, you insist

35:01.432 --> 35:03.726
your trip to your parents' party
had no campaign-related purpose.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.394
Yes, that's correct.
And yet you didn't
rejoin the campaign

35:05.478 --> 35:07.355
for another five days, did you?

35:07.438 --> 35:09.023
No, I didn't.
Because, having sealed the deal

35:09.106 --> 35:10.525
with Mr. Anderson's PAC,

35:10.608 --> 35:12.026
you were trying
to land more big game,

35:12.109 --> 35:14.529
weren't you?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.531
I was definitely trying
to land big game, Senator,

35:16.614 --> 35:17.740
but it had nothing
to do with politics.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.867
(door opens)

35:19.951 --> 35:21.244
Trevor?
Hey.

35:21.327 --> 35:24.372
How was San Francisco?

35:24.455 --> 35:25.832
Uh, good. Well, wh-what
are you doing here?

35:25.915 --> 35:27.208
It was a ten-hour drive
from D.C.,

35:27.291 --> 35:28.876
but there's something
I have to say.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.713
Me too.
Me first. Um...

35:32.797 --> 35:34.382
Look, I overreacted
because I was disappointed.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.842
Okay?

35:36.843 --> 35:38.386
But I love you.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.889
And I want to be with you.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.851
And if you'll still have me,
I'll move in,

35:44.934 --> 35:46.602
and the future will be
what it'll be.

35:50.147 --> 35:53.025
Okay?

35:53.109 --> 35:55.528
♪ ♪

35:55.611 --> 35:57.446
Yeah.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.448
Yeah, I still want
you to move in.

35:59.532 --> 36:02.368
Under one condition.

36:02.451 --> 36:04.745
(indistinct chatter)
Mom. Dad.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.373
Huh, what?
I want you to meet someone.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.750
(short chuckle) Hey.
This is Trevor.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.086
My fiancé.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.506
W... So...

36:16.507 --> 36:17.425
Uh... y-you're not with her?

36:17.508 --> 36:18.926
BLAKE:
Oh.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.220
(chuckles): N...
No.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.556
Stevie's just a friend.
A good friend, but, um,

36:23.639 --> 36:24.932
Trevor's the one I love.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.726
Oh.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.978
Thank God.

36:29.061 --> 36:30.104
Welcome to the family, honey.
(laughs)

36:30.187 --> 36:30.938
Oh!
BLAKE:
I guess

36:31.022 --> 36:34.358
you really mean that.
Oh, yeah.

36:34.442 --> 36:35.610
So the secretary
gave us five days off

36:35.693 --> 36:36.611
so we could celebrate.

36:36.694 --> 36:37.945
In the middle of a campaign.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.405
I mean, that is very generous.

36:39.488 --> 36:40.573
Mr. Moran...
I wanted to go to London,

36:40.656 --> 36:41.741
and Trevor's
more of a Paris guy,

36:41.824 --> 36:43.451
so we booked two Airbnbs.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.162
We added a night
in Provence.

36:46.245 --> 36:49.498
We don't even have a date
for the wedding.
Mr. Moran.

36:49.582 --> 36:52.084
As riveting as your detours into
your personal life have been,

36:52.168 --> 36:53.794
it reluctantly falls
upon me to announce

36:53.878 --> 36:55.630
that your testimony
before this committee

36:55.713 --> 36:57.131
is hereby concluded.
You are dismissed.

36:57.214 --> 36:58.466
Oh.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.176
Okay.
(chuckles)

37:00.259 --> 37:02.386
Go. Now.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.473
Please.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.017
Admiral.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.645
Madam President.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.648
You tipped The Chronicle
that this administration

37:13.731 --> 37:16.150
was considering the use
of autonomous weaponry

37:17.193 --> 37:18.527
to neutralize Laszlo Galassy.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.403
That is true.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.948
You're aware

37:22.031 --> 37:23.491
that by leaking
classified information,

37:23.574 --> 37:25.242
you committed a federal crime.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.786
Yes, ma'am.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.121
You should also be aware

37:29.205 --> 37:32.333
that you just made this country
that you served

37:32.416 --> 37:34.251
with honor and distinction
for over three decades

37:35.294 --> 37:36.837
less safe.
No, ma'am.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.340
Excuse me?

37:39.423 --> 37:41.133
You made us less safe.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.470
You failed us.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.472
You sent troops into harm's way

37:46.555 --> 37:47.848
when you could have spared them.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.351
You violated

37:50.434 --> 37:52.687
a leader's prime directive:

37:52.770 --> 37:53.896
to protect the men and women

37:53.980 --> 37:56.190
who put on the uniform.

37:56.273 --> 37:57.525
No, Ed.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.528
My prime directive

38:00.611 --> 38:04.323
is to protect all Americans.

38:06.325 --> 38:09.412
I'm going to take another step
to do that right now.

38:09.495 --> 38:10.871
Sir, you're in violation
of 18 U.S.C.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.373
Section 798. Please
put your hands

38:15.793 --> 38:16.877
behind your back.

38:16.961 --> 38:19.672
(handcuffs click)

38:20.673 --> 38:22.591
Thank you for your service,
Admiral.

38:22.675 --> 38:23.759
RUSSELL:
Madam President.

38:23.843 --> 38:27.722
Ma'am.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.062
We just heard back from the
Russians and the Chinese.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.356
ELIZABETH:
Good evening. Today,

38:37.440 --> 38:39.400
the United States,
China and Russia

38:39.483 --> 38:42.361
have agreed
to an immediate moratorium

38:42.445 --> 38:46.073
on the battlefield deployment
of autonomous weaponry.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.076
Artificial intelligence holds
great promise for humanity

38:49.160 --> 38:50.745
in medicine,
transportation and a host

38:50.828 --> 38:51.829
of worthy human endeavors.

38:51.912 --> 38:55.249
But that promise

38:55.332 --> 38:57.752
evaporates when A.I.
becomes an instrument of war.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.087
Autonomous weapons

39:00.171 --> 39:01.714
can't feel.
They can't regret.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.758
But they can be

39:03.841 --> 39:05.426
programmed to kill,
and when they do,

39:05.509 --> 39:09.138
they can't be called back

39:09.221 --> 39:11.724
because they're built
to override human intervention.

39:11.807 --> 39:13.392
They may even conclude
our humanity

39:13.476 --> 39:15.811
is the glitch in the system,

39:15.895 --> 39:18.606
the weakness
that needs to be eradicated.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.983
Humankind has spent
more time,

39:21.067 --> 39:23.402
energy and money perfecting war

39:23.486 --> 39:26.113
than on any other
human endeavor.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.449
We have fought each other
to the brink of starvation

39:28.532 --> 39:31.952
and the edge of extinction,

39:32.036 --> 39:35.498
but the one aspect of warfare
that safeguards our survival

39:35.581 --> 39:38.584
is meaningful human control.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.878
The reluctance
to put troops in harm's way

39:40.961 --> 39:43.130
and the compassion
to sue for peace

39:43.214 --> 39:46.467
when enough blood
has been spilt.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.095
These are considerations
alien to robots.

39:49.178 --> 39:52.598
Allowing machines
to choose to kill us

39:52.681 --> 39:55.643
will eliminate these safeguards
and will forever

39:55.726 --> 39:57.853
erode our freedom and security.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.814
That day must never come.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.316
We must not consign our fate

40:02.399 --> 40:04.985
to algorithms.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.864
I look forward to productive
talks with our partners

40:08.948 --> 40:11.700
across the globe
about how to safely harness A.I.

40:11.784 --> 40:15.037
Technology is not the enemy

40:15.121 --> 40:16.872
unless we allow it
to substitute its judgment

40:16.956 --> 40:20.167
for our own.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.337
Congratulations on averting
the robot apocalypse.

40:23.420 --> 40:24.338
So...
tell us about the political one.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.841
Today's festivities

40:26.924 --> 40:28.884
included Hanson's
committee trying to prove

40:28.968 --> 40:31.470
that Blake Moran
and Stephanie McCord

40:31.554 --> 40:33.681
illegally coordinated with
Shelton Anderson's PAC.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.891
How?
By hitching a ride

40:35.975 --> 40:38.018
to an anniversary party.
(sighs)

40:38.102 --> 40:39.895
That's better than implying
that I whacked a state senator.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.022
It's death by a
thousand cuts, Mike,

40:42.106 --> 40:43.691
and Hanson just started
sharpening his blade.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.860
The press secretary,

40:45.943 --> 40:46.944
the president's daughter,
her husband-- they all have yet

40:47.027 --> 40:49.071
to appear
before the committee.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.281
How long can we keep
the president out of the loop?

40:50.364 --> 40:52.783
Not much longer.

40:52.867 --> 40:53.784
She needs to know.
MIKE:
Well, then, she opens herself up

40:53.868 --> 40:55.744
to charges she was coordinating
with her staff

40:55.828 --> 40:57.788
to subvert the investigation.
It's not good.

41:00.249 --> 41:02.209
No.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.545
You know, I think
I figured it out.

41:04.628 --> 41:06.672
You certainly did.

41:06.755 --> 41:09.258
What do you mean?

41:09.341 --> 41:11.927
Getting the Russians
and the Chinese on board

41:12.011 --> 41:13.971
with an autonomous weapons ban.
What do you mean?

41:14.054 --> 41:15.181
My dream.
Oh.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.640
The one where
you can't use your phone?

41:16.724 --> 41:18.559
No, that's every dream.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.895
The one with Peter Harriman.

41:20.978 --> 41:23.731
I think it's about

41:23.814 --> 41:26.817
being responsible for
people in your care.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.738
Accountability.
Yeah.

41:32.489 --> 41:35.075
Machines don't have
to answer to anyone.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.119
And they never have to look
a grieving parent in the eye.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.038
You're talking about
a conscience.

41:39.121 --> 41:41.040
Mine's weighing heavy on me.

41:41.123 --> 41:43.584
Well, you made the right call.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.920
It's the first time I sent...

41:46.003 --> 41:47.922
troops to their death.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.554
It won't be the last.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.766
I still think
about the missions I flew.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.434
The souls lost on both sides.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.603
The human toll is something

42:02.686 --> 42:04.438
that stays with you forever,
I guess.

42:04.521 --> 42:07.233
It's the warrior's burden.

42:08.234 --> 42:10.319
But it also
makes you cherish life.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.904
Okay, I'm gonna
make us some tea.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.406
We're gonna get some sleep,

42:14.490 --> 42:17.034
wake up tomorrow
and do it all again

42:19.036 --> 42:20.454
and hope to do it
just a little bit better.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.006
(whines)

42:33.175 --> 42:36.178
Hi.

42:37.179 --> 42:38.973
Hope.
That's your name.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.391
Hope.

42:41.558 --> 42:43.018
Hi.

42:54.071 --> 42:56.073
Thank you.
