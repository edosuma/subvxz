WEBVTT

01:16.222 --> 01:20.257
Yo, we're gonna look for dead
bodies at the Seneda warehouse.

01:20.259 --> 01:22.393
You wanna come?

01:22.395 --> 01:26.097
What will you do if you
actually find a dead body?

01:27.166 --> 01:29.667
Roll it over!

01:29.669 --> 01:32.870
Yeah, we'll probably
roll it over.

01:32.872 --> 01:35.239
Are you going into forensics?

01:35.241 --> 01:38.542
Why would we go there?

01:38.544 --> 01:40.377
I think we're just gonna
stay here.

01:42.582 --> 01:44.115
Yeah.

01:44.117 --> 01:46.450
Suit yourselves.

01:51.357 --> 01:53.290
Hammer toss!

02:01.834 --> 02:05.469
Oh, shit! Hold up.
Extra large slush puppies?

02:05.471 --> 02:07.338
Really?

02:07.340 --> 02:09.205
You know, I don't care what they
say, you guys know how to party.

02:09.208 --> 02:12.510
Seriously. Seriously.

02:12.512 --> 02:13.878
I hate this town.

02:13.880 --> 02:17.148
Are you kidding me, man!

02:17.150 --> 02:20.251
Whatever drugs everyone is on
seem to be working pretty well.

02:21.787 --> 02:24.188
Is this the big reward?

02:24.190 --> 02:25.823
I mean, did we really
not get invited...

02:25.825 --> 02:27.658
To any graduation parties?

02:27.660 --> 02:30.461
Come on, if you don't get
invited to a single party...

02:30.463 --> 02:33.597
For four years straight, you
don't generally get invited...

02:33.599 --> 02:35.833
Yeah, well, it's graduation, you
graduate together as a class...

02:35.835 --> 02:37.301
So you'd think after...

02:37.303 --> 02:38.936
Dude, we traded cool
for college.

02:38.938 --> 02:41.372
Yeah, i...

02:41.374 --> 02:43.240
All I'm saying is, I'm looking
at this thing...

02:43.242 --> 02:46.577
And I don't feel as good
as the people out there.

02:46.579 --> 02:48.212
We're just sitting here.

02:48.214 --> 02:49.513
Bro, what were you expecting?

02:49.515 --> 02:54.618
I don't know. Something cool.

02:57.890 --> 03:00.291
I'll just take us home.

03:40.833 --> 03:43.000
Hello, Andy.

03:43.002 --> 03:44.969
Hey, Yaco.

03:44.971 --> 03:47.738
Have you been looking forward
to another summer...

03:47.740 --> 03:49.707
As much as I have?

03:49.709 --> 03:52.776
Last year you were only
a janitor.

03:52.778 --> 03:55.446
Groundskeeper, actually.

03:55.448 --> 03:58.449
But this year you're a pro!

03:58.451 --> 04:01.719
You realize this could only
happen with my blessing.

04:01.721 --> 04:06.523
You are my beggar apostle
and I am your Christ.

04:06.525 --> 04:09.293
Well, I appreciate you putting
in a good word with the board.

04:09.295 --> 04:11.996
After lunch, you'll be teaching
the beginner ladies classes...

04:11.998 --> 04:14.765
And Salvatore will be handling
the men.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.868
Okay, cool.

04:17.870 --> 04:20.303
Any tips for the new guy?

04:20.305 --> 04:22.573
Do not let the women chat
with each other.

04:22.575 --> 04:26.944
Once they start, they learn
nothing.

04:28.014 --> 04:30.547
You have to be a man.

04:30.549 --> 04:34.285
Yeah, my dad says that, too.

05:17.963 --> 05:20.798
Muay Thai, punch!

05:20.800 --> 05:23.033
Guys, in the
post-apocalyptic future,

05:23.035 --> 05:25.636
in which we survive by
eating cats and the elderly,

05:25.638 --> 05:29.106
you will need to know how
to punch. Stop smiling.

05:29.108 --> 05:31.942
In the future, smiling will
be seen as a sign

05:31.944 --> 05:36.413
you wish to be eaten. Hai!

05:39.952 --> 05:41.785
As a parting thought...

05:41.787 --> 05:46.757
Remember, the prickliest
cactus can still give you water.

05:46.759 --> 05:48.792
Class dismissed.

05:51.797 --> 05:53.864
What did that cactus mean?

05:53.866 --> 05:55.632
What do you think it means?

05:55.634 --> 05:58.569
Something scary can be good?

05:58.571 --> 06:01.905
That's right. Don't be afraid
of something for how it looks...

06:01.907 --> 06:03.974
Because it might be special
inside.

06:03.976 --> 06:05.976
Hey, you!
Hi!

06:07.380 --> 06:09.780
Oh... olive,
you know this lady?

06:09.782 --> 06:11.014
She's my cousin!

06:11.016 --> 06:12.750
Hey, hey, I'm just making sure.

06:12.752 --> 06:15.052
Rival Dojos are trying to steal
my students all the time...

06:15.054 --> 06:16.887
Because you're the best.

06:16.889 --> 06:19.523
I'm Tinsley. Olive's
mom asked me to pick her up.

06:19.525 --> 06:22.059
How's it going? I'm the lion.

06:22.061 --> 06:23.994
I haven't seen you before.

06:23.996 --> 06:25.896
Yeah, I come here every summer.

06:25.898 --> 06:27.164
I haven't seen you before.

06:27.166 --> 06:28.966
Oh yeah, I'm one of the locals.

06:28.968 --> 06:32.035
Oh, wow, I don't
think I've ever met a local.

06:32.037 --> 06:33.904
They hide us
during the summer...

06:33.906 --> 06:36.173
So we don't upset the tourists.

06:36.175 --> 06:38.008
The lion should come to your
party.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.477
Yes, I'm having
a party at my parent's house...

06:40.479 --> 06:42.579
On the point this afternoon.
You should come!

06:42.581 --> 06:46.049
I'm sorry, are you
inviting me to a party?

06:46.051 --> 06:47.151
Yeah, I am.

06:47.153 --> 06:49.953
But... but, I'm me.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.422
You can bring whoever you want.

06:51.424 --> 06:53.490
I'll see you later today.
Bye.

06:53.492 --> 06:55.692
- Take care.
- Thank you!

06:55.694 --> 06:56.827
See you, guys.
Was that fun?

06:56.829 --> 06:57.928
Yeah!

06:57.930 --> 07:00.164
Oh!

07:00.166 --> 07:01.732
You are the man, lion!

07:01.734 --> 07:03.801
Good looks! Good looks!

07:03.803 --> 07:08.205
Wow, you weren't even
nervous, bro. I'm all right.

07:08.207 --> 07:09.740
No, I was pretty nervous.

07:09.742 --> 07:13.143
So, Andy, have
you heard anything...

07:13.145 --> 07:14.778
From your imaginary
Indian pen pal?

07:14.780 --> 07:17.481
Yes, she actually
wants to come to the cape...

07:17.483 --> 07:18.882
In August before
she goes to UCLA.

07:18.884 --> 07:20.784
Whoa...

07:20.786 --> 07:22.953
But apparently, it's $2,000
to get her here from Mumbai...

07:22.955 --> 07:24.888
In the summer, so I want
to figure out a way to help.

07:24.890 --> 07:26.723
So, out of curiosity,
when she emails you...

07:26.725 --> 07:29.593
Does it go to your spam folder
and you have to drag it out?

07:29.595 --> 07:32.596
Yeah, sometimes, because
she's from a far away place.

07:32.598 --> 07:34.565
Uh, okay, have you guys
skyped at all?

07:34.567 --> 07:38.135
No, she's from a remote area
and her family's computer...

07:38.137 --> 07:40.137
Doesn't have a working camera.

07:40.139 --> 07:43.774
It's not a scheme, you guys,
okay? She's exists!

07:43.776 --> 07:46.643
Bro, I still don't entirely
understand how you met her.

07:46.645 --> 07:49.079
I told you a million times,
she's an econ nerd, too...

07:49.081 --> 07:51.915
She posts comments on a website
that I read and I emailed her...

07:51.917 --> 07:53.684
That I liked her ideas
and we hit it off.

07:53.686 --> 07:55.085
It's your murderer...

07:55.087 --> 07:56.620
These are the last months
of your life, bro.

07:56.622 --> 07:58.922
Let's say that this girl
is real.

07:58.924 --> 08:01.525
She's gonna have way more
experience than you.

08:01.527 --> 08:04.528
Okay, Cleopatra,
how do you know that?

08:04.530 --> 08:06.597
Under what scenario could a
human being on this earth...

08:06.599 --> 08:08.198
Not have more
experience than you?

08:08.200 --> 08:10.133
I've been... I've
done... I've done things.

08:10.135 --> 08:11.768
Oh, and India
has the Kama Sutra, bro.

08:11.770 --> 08:13.670
Exactly! India
has the Kama Sutra.

08:13.672 --> 08:15.873
Yeah, they like, fuck
sideways and shit, bro.

08:15.875 --> 08:18.675
That's intimidating for anybody.
It is.

08:18.677 --> 08:21.578
I'm not intimidated.

08:26.919 --> 08:28.785
Did that shirt
shrink in the wash?

08:28.787 --> 08:31.288
No, I don't know, I can't really
figure out what happened.

08:31.290 --> 08:32.823
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

08:32.825 --> 08:34.558
Oh, yes! Sweet!
Wow, crazy!

08:34.559 --> 08:36.693
Just a little something new
I'm working with.

08:36.695 --> 08:38.729
If I can't impress my friends,
there's no way I'm gonna...

08:38.731 --> 08:40.197
Be impressing the
food network, so... dig in!

08:40.198 --> 08:41.965
Oh, yeah, this looks great.
Guys, guys, guys...

08:41.967 --> 08:44.101
I waited until
we were all together...

08:44.102 --> 08:48.205
To bring this up,
but I have information.

08:48.207 --> 08:49.806
About what?

08:49.808 --> 08:52.009
About a party on the point.

08:52.011 --> 08:54.978
To be specific, I have
an invitation to a party...

08:54.980 --> 08:58.048
On the point this afternoon
and I can bring anyone I want!

08:58.050 --> 09:00.017
Okay, calm down.
Who invited you to the point?

09:00.019 --> 09:02.019
I've never been on the point.
Yeah, me, neither.

09:02.021 --> 09:05.556
You're sure this is true? We're
invited to an actual party?

09:05.558 --> 09:08.725
Bro, bro, bro, no, it's real!

09:08.727 --> 09:11.128
And it starts today
and goes all night!

09:11.130 --> 09:13.163
I'm assuming, I'm assuming.

09:13.165 --> 09:15.666
I don't know, man, I gotta
finish up here after lunch.

09:15.668 --> 09:17.200
I have an 11:00 o'clock
curfew...

09:17.202 --> 09:18.802
So it's like it doesn't
even make sense to go.

09:18.804 --> 09:20.571
Two "no's" immediately
from the group!

09:20.573 --> 09:22.573
I mean, you're going to Harvard,
why do you need a curfew?

09:22.575 --> 09:25.175
Curfews are for riot zones
and crumbling dictatorships...

09:25.177 --> 09:26.243
Not for us!

09:26.245 --> 09:28.045
Dramatic.

09:28.047 --> 09:30.180
Lion, what would happen if
you missed your curfew today?

09:30.182 --> 09:33.050
Huh? You're going to
Mit on scholarship.

09:33.052 --> 09:35.018
You know, my parents actually
don't get home...

09:35.020 --> 09:36.787
Until like 4:00 am
most weekends.

09:36.789 --> 09:39.790
I'm starting to think
they're swingers, man.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.593
Stanford-bound spice, you?

09:42.595 --> 09:44.328
I've been here until 2:00
before.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.896
My parents will probably
just think I'm here.

09:45.898 --> 09:48.098
There you go.
What are you trying to say, bro?

09:51.670 --> 09:53.236
- Andy!
- Dude!

09:53.238 --> 09:54.638
Whoo!
Whoo!

09:54.640 --> 09:56.039
You know I have
to clean that up, right?

09:56.041 --> 09:57.374
That was badass! Yes!
Yeah! Yes!

09:57.376 --> 09:58.842
Breaking stuff!

09:58.844 --> 10:00.611
You know I work here, don't you?

10:00.613 --> 10:02.346
I'm sorry about the glass,
I'm trying to make a point.

10:02.348 --> 10:04.014
The reason that we never
partied in high school...

10:04.016 --> 10:06.116
Is because we wanted
to get out of here.

10:06.118 --> 10:08.919
And now we are! And I feel
like I missed out on some...

10:08.921 --> 10:11.254
Experiences and I
know you guys do, too.

10:11.256 --> 10:12.923
Lion, what do you
wish you'd done?

10:12.925 --> 10:17.327
Uh... ancient Asians
took this mushroom called...

10:17.329 --> 10:20.097
Fly Agaric, by feeding
it to reindeer and drinking...

10:20.099 --> 10:21.298
Its urine for
psychedelic effects.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.933
What?

10:22.935 --> 10:25.235
You're talking
about doing some drugs?

10:25.237 --> 10:26.770
Put some drugs in you!

10:26.772 --> 10:28.705
Nora, what do you want to do?

10:28.707 --> 10:32.242
Uh, I think it would have
been cool to have a boyfriend.

10:33.278 --> 10:34.778
Why are you laughing?

10:34.780 --> 10:36.647
I don't... I don't think
we knew that.

10:36.649 --> 10:38.148
It's not that uncommon a thing.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.150
Go get yourself a boyfriend!

10:40.152 --> 10:43.153
Wow, thank you
for your approval, Andy.

10:43.155 --> 10:45.255
Spice? Talk to me.

10:45.257 --> 10:48.358
You know, I'm ready
to hook up with a girl.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.260
Mm-hm.
I need release.

10:50.262 --> 10:51.428
Release, release!
Say no more.

10:51.430 --> 10:52.729
Thank you.
We know what that means.

10:52.731 --> 10:54.398
Yeah, I do.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.366
What I'm saying, is this
afternoon, starting at this...

10:56.368 --> 10:59.770
Party, we do all the things
that we wish we'd done...

10:59.772 --> 11:01.972
The last four years.

11:01.974 --> 11:06.743
Drinking, drugs, sex...
With girls.

11:06.745 --> 11:10.981
Release yourself! Relationships!
I want hard miles!

11:10.983 --> 11:12.816
I don't want to go to college
as some lamb...

11:12.818 --> 11:14.117
Being led to slaughter.

11:14.119 --> 11:16.386
I don't want to be
boring anymore.

11:16.388 --> 11:19.423
From now on, this is the
summer of "yes!"

11:19.425 --> 11:22.025
Let's just say, "yes!"

11:22.027 --> 11:23.360
Say, "yes!"
Yes!

11:23.362 --> 11:25.028
Say, "yes!"
Yes!

11:25.030 --> 11:26.963
Spice?
Hell, yeah.

11:26.965 --> 11:28.732
Yeah!

11:28.734 --> 11:33.203
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes!

11:36.341 --> 11:38.241
All right, welcome to summer!

11:38.243 --> 11:41.712
Okay, Gabby, here we go.

11:41.714 --> 11:43.246
Whoa, Gabby!

11:43.248 --> 11:45.182
Oh! That's it!

11:45.184 --> 11:47.217
I love your visor, Mrs. Jones.

11:47.219 --> 11:48.852
Here's our star player
right here.

11:48.854 --> 11:51.021
- This is our star tennis player.
- Whoo!

11:51.023 --> 11:53.790
You just dance around the court.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.926
That winter was too long, huh?

11:55.928 --> 11:57.427
Uh-huh!
Too long.

11:57.429 --> 12:01.765
Nice! Strong!
Beautiful stroke.

12:01.767 --> 12:04.434
That's way over there,
that's a bench shot.

12:04.436 --> 12:06.470
We'll give you a couple points
for hitting the bench.

12:06.472 --> 12:08.839
Okay, Gabby, here we go.

12:12.211 --> 12:14.344
Now, Gabby, you're doing this,
right?

12:14.346 --> 12:18.381
And we're going to need more of
just sort of like a this, right?

12:24.523 --> 12:27.023
Good group, great group, wow.

12:29.828 --> 12:31.361
Andy?
Yeah?

12:31.363 --> 12:33.363
When did you turn 18?

12:33.365 --> 12:34.765
Uh, January.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.166
Happy birthday.

12:36.168 --> 12:37.618
It was, uh...

12:37.619 --> 12:39.069
You know what? You should
come over for drinks sometime.

12:39.071 --> 12:41.972
18 is the drinking
age in most of the world.

12:41.974 --> 12:44.441
I should have been born foreign.

12:44.443 --> 12:47.277
Being a tennis pro
automatically makes you foreign.

12:47.279 --> 12:50.847
Well, then, c'est parfait.

12:51.984 --> 12:53.517
You're not!

12:53.519 --> 12:55.352
Thinking.

12:57.890 --> 13:01.224
Andy, do you teach private
tennis lessons?

13:01.226 --> 13:03.960
Don't all pros?

13:03.962 --> 13:07.063
In my experience.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.834
Hm...

13:43.135 --> 13:46.303
Why in the world would Danya
be sending bikini pictures...

13:46.305 --> 13:48.839
To you that early in the morning
on a Sunday, bro?

13:48.841 --> 13:51.575
She is an insomniac,
that's why...

13:51.577 --> 13:54.077
And it's not unusual
for her to email me late.

13:54.079 --> 13:56.413
You are so talking to
a guy sitting in his attic...

13:56.415 --> 13:58.281
In Worchester wearing
clown makeup.

14:00.118 --> 14:01.885
Let's do this, guys.

14:01.887 --> 14:04.187
Here we go.

14:05.357 --> 14:10.160
Let me see. Right here,
the lion, great.

14:10.162 --> 14:14.598
Hey, you guys have a good time,
be safe, okay? We'll see ya.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.266
All right.
Thank you.

14:16.268 --> 14:17.567
Okay!

14:19.905 --> 14:21.905
We're gonna go to a party!

14:32.551 --> 14:34.434
I just think that this...

14:34.435 --> 14:36.318
It's crazy that this is in our
town, you know what I mean?

14:36.321 --> 14:38.188
I know, that this
actually exists here...

14:38.190 --> 14:40.090
Like minutes away from us.

14:40.092 --> 14:41.224
Right.
Whoa.

14:41.226 --> 14:43.143
It's like if
George Washington...

14:43.144 --> 14:45.504
And Norman Rockwell fucked and
had kids and they had houses.

14:46.131 --> 14:48.231
Oh, dude!

14:48.233 --> 14:50.200
I finally know
how bad our lives suck.

14:54.206 --> 14:55.505
This is crazy.

14:55.507 --> 14:56.573
Massive.

14:56.575 --> 14:59.109
That is a
shitload of individuals.

14:59.111 --> 15:01.211
Can I just park here?

15:01.213 --> 15:03.914
If you're going
to park here, Andy...

15:03.916 --> 15:06.182
You have to be really careful,
seriously!

15:06.184 --> 15:08.084
He's gonna hit...
I'm not gonna hit anything.

15:08.086 --> 15:10.453
What a nice spot we got!

15:12.457 --> 15:15.158
Should we like kick it
for five or 20 minutes?

15:15.160 --> 15:17.961
No, we're going in.

15:17.963 --> 15:19.429
Just say, "yes."

15:21.199 --> 15:24.401
Say, "yes."

15:30.442 --> 15:34.344
Wow, I am a prairie dog
in heaven right now.

15:36.014 --> 15:39.215
I don't know what to do
with my hands.

15:43.989 --> 15:45.622
I think... should we just go...

15:45.624 --> 15:47.090
Yeah, we go right in there,
right?

15:47.092 --> 15:48.558
Everybody's, yeah...

15:48.560 --> 15:53.363
Hey, oh, nice, so,
where are the drinks?

15:55.100 --> 15:56.566
Yes.
Right.

15:56.568 --> 15:58.068
I feel like I
could have told you that.

15:58.070 --> 16:01.004
You the man, bro. Okay.
Do they have beers, too?

16:24.363 --> 16:26.329
We don't belong here.

16:26.331 --> 16:27.881
Yes, we do.

16:27.882 --> 16:29.432
All right, we're just
uncomfortable...

16:29.434 --> 16:32.135
Because we don't have drinks
in our hands.

16:32.137 --> 16:34.137
Let's go.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.314
The drinks are up there.

16:57.396 --> 16:59.763
What are you doing?
No idea!

17:02.034 --> 17:04.367
Ooh, shoot.

17:06.505 --> 17:08.538
Okay... okay... drinks.

17:08.540 --> 17:12.541
Starting now,
"yes" to everything.

17:12.544 --> 17:14.477
Yes!
Yes!

17:14.479 --> 17:16.746
Yes!

17:21.619 --> 17:24.087
Dude, I'm gonna...

17:28.093 --> 17:29.726
It's like fire in my body.

17:29.728 --> 17:31.094
I'm gonna throw up!

17:31.096 --> 17:33.563
There's a fire in my body.

17:36.568 --> 17:40.236
No, seriously, I wouldn't
lie about Midgetville.

17:40.238 --> 17:41.771
And for the record, we wish it
was called something else...

17:41.773 --> 17:45.642
Too, but... maybe we can
be the change.

17:47.179 --> 17:50.113
I don't know what I'm saying.

17:50.115 --> 17:51.714
These guys are different.

17:54.653 --> 17:56.119
Dragon.

17:56.121 --> 17:57.387
Oh...

17:57.389 --> 17:59.155
Rahrr...

18:03.595 --> 18:07.597
Nora! Thought I saw you.
Come have a cigarette.

18:07.599 --> 18:09.466
No, I don't... I don't...
Come on.

18:09.468 --> 18:13.369
Of course, I do,
because it's the summer of yes.

18:14.806 --> 18:16.272
So pretty.

18:16.274 --> 18:18.208
You have that right.
Tinsley, this is Nora.

18:18.210 --> 18:19.609
Hey.
Hi.

18:19.611 --> 18:21.111
Hi, Tinsley.
We work at the lab together.

18:21.113 --> 18:22.178
Thank you. Oh...

18:27.819 --> 18:30.820
Well, that's so... you're here,
we're both here, that...

18:30.822 --> 18:33.323
Yeah, I'm staying down
the road with some friends...

18:33.325 --> 18:35.291
And their son dragged me along.
Oh, cool.

18:35.293 --> 18:37.427
I think I'm the oldest
person here by about ten years.

18:39.431 --> 18:42.232
I love your dress, by the way.
Oh.

18:42.234 --> 18:44.400
God, I wish I had boobs
like yours.

18:48.907 --> 18:51.057
Hmm.

18:51.058 --> 18:53.208
There's no way, it's the hardest
dessert to make in the world.

18:53.211 --> 18:57.380
No, I'm telling you, spice could
make a soufflé right now...

18:57.382 --> 18:59.215
And it would be delicious.

18:59.217 --> 19:01.851
It would instantly
collapse. This party's loud.

19:01.853 --> 19:04.821
No, no, okay, I bet you $100...

19:04.823 --> 19:08.258
$100 that I could
make a soufflé right now...

19:08.260 --> 19:10.193
And it'll stay standing,
it will not collapse.

19:12.364 --> 19:13.630
You're on.

19:15.267 --> 19:16.666
$100?

19:18.570 --> 19:20.403
Hey, give me those mitts!
Is that flour?

19:20.405 --> 19:22.172
Oh, that's cocaine!

19:22.174 --> 19:23.806
What are your
hidden talents, Andy?

19:23.808 --> 19:26.643
My hidden talents...
Well, it's pretty useless...

19:26.645 --> 19:33.483
But I can catch food thrown
from any distance, in my mouth.

19:33.485 --> 19:37.854
Mmm, okay.

19:37.856 --> 19:40.890
Oh, you're gonna do it? Okay.

19:44.329 --> 19:46.429
You can go bigger than that.

19:47.948 --> 19:49.464
Okay, wait, okay, I'm not...
I'm serious...

19:49.467 --> 19:52.202
I'm not messing around
right now! Come on!

19:56.341 --> 19:59.742
I catch stuff!
I catch stuff in my mouth!

19:59.744 --> 20:02.312
I catch marshmallows
in my mouth! Woo!

20:06.551 --> 20:11.654
Is he doing, high Tai chi?

20:11.656 --> 20:14.524
"High chi?"

20:21.466 --> 20:23.566
Just say, "yes?"

20:23.568 --> 20:27.003
Summer of yes, this is good,
this is good.

20:29.274 --> 20:30.974
I don't like cold water...

20:30.976 --> 20:33.643
So, maybe we can
take our clothes off inside.

20:33.645 --> 20:37.814
Oh... yes... yes.

20:41.453 --> 20:43.486
It has risen!

20:43.488 --> 20:45.722
I am the greatest chef
on this planet!

20:50.962 --> 20:53.696
Consider comping the check?

20:53.698 --> 20:56.833
We can think of something.

20:57.802 --> 20:59.802
Take off those mittens.

21:11.483 --> 21:12.915
Hey.

21:16.588 --> 21:18.655
Hi.

21:18.657 --> 21:21.724
I think this is the part where
you take your clothes off, too.

21:21.726 --> 21:25.061
Yeah, me, yeah.

21:27.999 --> 21:31.534
You're like freakishly tall,
huh?

21:31.536 --> 21:32.568
Yeah.

21:36.474 --> 21:39.909
That's a really cool bag.
Or is it a clutch? Or...

21:43.615 --> 21:45.381
You haven't done this before,
have you?

21:45.383 --> 21:47.784
No.

21:47.786 --> 21:52.455
And I actually need like 10,000
practice hours before August.

21:52.457 --> 21:54.557
Malcolm Gladwell, outliers?

21:54.559 --> 21:56.793
Yeah, I need to be an expert.

21:56.795 --> 21:57.994
Why?

21:57.996 --> 22:01.864
I have this Indian
girl coming to visit me.

22:01.866 --> 22:03.966
They have the Kama Sutra.

22:03.968 --> 22:07.437
I... exactly.

22:07.439 --> 22:11.708
But, I'm sorry, I'm like talking
about another girl and...

22:11.710 --> 22:14.811
On the bed... now!

22:16.548 --> 22:18.948
Yes... on the bed.

22:25.457 --> 22:28.358
Relax.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.693
We can at least knock a couple
of minutes...

22:30.695 --> 22:32.795
Off those 10,000 hours.

22:37.902 --> 22:41.637
Are you gonna keep doing
that face?

22:52.450 --> 22:56.152
I know, it's... I feel like
making out on the beach...

22:56.154 --> 22:58.621
Is less comfortable than it
looks on TV.

22:58.623 --> 23:01.090
Yeah. Your body is amazing.

23:01.092 --> 23:02.692
Really?
Yes!

23:02.694 --> 23:04.961
Whoa, thank you. That's new.

23:04.963 --> 23:07.163
Yeah?
Yeah.

23:18.843 --> 23:22.879
I understand what you want, but
I'm not a hand job machine!

23:22.881 --> 23:24.580
I have to feel special about
someone...

23:24.582 --> 23:27.016
Before I give them a hand job.

23:27.018 --> 23:30.119
I thought the soufflé
was special.

23:30.121 --> 23:32.655
If you had tried some
subtlety...

23:32.657 --> 23:34.857
Instead of moving your hips
all creepily...

23:34.859 --> 23:37.160
You would have got one.

23:38.897 --> 23:40.029
But...

23:40.031 --> 23:41.864
Go fuck your soufflé!

23:44.836 --> 23:48.137
Where have you been?
We have been worried!

23:48.139 --> 23:49.739
Sorry.

23:49.741 --> 23:51.574
What have you been up
to tonight?

23:52.944 --> 23:56.979
Not too much... goodnight.

24:52.570 --> 24:55.004
Please just send me to my room.

24:56.841 --> 24:58.674
Thank you.

25:01.079 --> 25:03.846
What do you think happened
to him?

25:03.848 --> 25:05.882
I don't know, but I'm jealous.

25:17.095 --> 25:21.964
Oh, jeez, feel free to pass me
a new skull, man, honestly.

25:21.966 --> 25:25.535
Yeah, no, I can feel my brain
decaying lobe by lobe.

25:25.537 --> 25:27.003
Andy, hey, Andy!

25:28.973 --> 25:31.207
Dude. Oh!

25:31.209 --> 25:34.310
That's what I'm talking about.

25:34.312 --> 25:36.979
Why are people
throwing food at you?

25:36.981 --> 25:39.181
Oh, you were skinny dipping
with a 30-year-old man...

25:39.183 --> 25:40.550
During my performance.

25:40.552 --> 25:41.884
It was glorious.

25:41.886 --> 25:43.886
When did you get a body, anyway?
Last night.

25:43.888 --> 25:47.790
Hmm, that's pretty
crazy. You're finally a girl.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.258
Thank you.

25:49.260 --> 25:51.294
Must have been awkward
today with your coworker.

25:51.296 --> 25:54.997
No, no, we're gonna actually
hang out again later this week.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.198
Alone?

25:56.200 --> 25:59.602
Yeah... summer of yes.

26:01.105 --> 26:03.272
Are you hanging out
with anybody alone, lion?

26:03.274 --> 26:06.776
Oh, uh, just some guys
who have an opium connection.

26:06.778 --> 26:09.078
Well, you guys had fun...

26:09.080 --> 26:11.881
I don't think that girl
wants to see me again.

26:11.883 --> 26:13.916
No release?

26:13.918 --> 26:16.469
Not a drop.

26:16.470 --> 26:19.021
But I did get us invited
to another party... on a dock.

26:19.023 --> 26:21.023
Two rich girls invited me.

26:21.025 --> 26:21.991
Boom.

26:21.993 --> 26:23.192
Round two!
Really?

26:23.194 --> 26:24.894
Yeah, man!
Guys, guys?

26:24.896 --> 26:26.762
Have we somehow become cool?

26:41.312 --> 26:43.346
Whoa, whoa.
Hey.

26:43.348 --> 26:44.947
Hey, you again.

26:44.949 --> 26:47.383
Um, I'm actually here
to teach a lesson.

26:47.385 --> 26:49.752
And to pick up my
car from the party.

26:49.754 --> 26:50.820
We walked home.

26:50.822 --> 26:52.822
Lion swam, I think.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.759
See ya!

27:18.349 --> 27:21.884
Gabby, it's Andy!
It's lesson time.

27:39.003 --> 27:42.972
Uh, Gabby, are you in here?

27:42.974 --> 27:45.241
I'm almost done.

27:45.243 --> 27:47.777
I left your money
on the night table.

27:47.779 --> 27:49.679
Okay, okay, cool.

27:49.681 --> 27:51.013
I'm so glad you could come.

27:51.015 --> 27:52.548
Me, too.

27:52.549 --> 27:54.082
It's weird, I didn't see
your court coming in here.

27:54.085 --> 27:56.752
That's because
there is no court.

27:56.754 --> 28:01.023
Holy shit! Gabby, wait,
Gabby, what are you doing?

28:01.025 --> 28:04.093
Gabby... Gabby!

28:04.095 --> 28:06.095
Shut up, Andy.

28:06.097 --> 28:07.697
Okay.

28:21.746 --> 28:23.345
Five times?

28:23.347 --> 28:25.715
Five times.

28:25.717 --> 28:29.151
It's like the olym...
The Olympics or something.

28:29.153 --> 28:31.721
The "vagathalon."

28:39.063 --> 28:43.365
Hey, all right. Hey now.

28:43.367 --> 28:45.835
What kind of tennis
lesson takes three hours?

28:45.837 --> 28:52.908
Oh, we were just, uh, working
on strokes... techniques.

28:52.910 --> 28:57.046
Forehand, backhand... grips.

28:57.048 --> 28:58.814
See ya!

29:18.903 --> 29:21.403
I think the lion is taking acid.

29:24.342 --> 29:28.043
Yeah, he said he wants to
push his body to its limits.

29:28.045 --> 29:31.347
Does Tai chi help with fighting?

29:34.118 --> 29:37.219
Bruce Lee once said...

29:37.221 --> 29:40.556
"A wise man can learn more
from a foolish question...

29:40.558 --> 29:43.192
"Then a fool can learn
from a wise answer."

29:46.264 --> 29:48.130
Have you ever used it to fight?

29:52.403 --> 29:55.137
When it's finally
time for me to fight...

29:56.874 --> 29:59.341
I'll know.

29:59.343 --> 30:04.380
Oh jeez, look at that.
Who's this guy?

30:04.382 --> 30:07.149
Is he her boyfriend now
or something?

30:07.151 --> 30:11.220
What kind of Australian
is named, Erland?

30:11.222 --> 30:13.189
Who cares, she's happy.

30:13.191 --> 30:15.224
He's 12 years older than her.

30:15.226 --> 30:17.092
Yeah, and if I was
30 years old...

30:17.094 --> 30:20.329
I'd be wanting to nail
18-year-olds too, man.

30:20.331 --> 30:21.931
Guy's a creep.

30:21.933 --> 30:23.365
Holy shit!

30:23.367 --> 30:24.533
Hm?

30:24.535 --> 30:26.335
You like Nora!

30:27.972 --> 30:31.140
I like nor... are you out
of your mind?

30:31.142 --> 30:33.075
She's been my friend
since I was born.

30:33.077 --> 30:35.077
Yeah, and until recently
she's dressed like a guy...

30:35.079 --> 30:36.478
And you've looked like an
acupuncture needle.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.881
You're jealous.

30:38.883 --> 30:43.185
Look, I don't know
what I'm feeling.

30:43.187 --> 30:46.589
You poor, sensitive,
tragic soul, you.

30:46.591 --> 30:49.258
Three days ago, a 42-year-old
woman paid me...

30:49.260 --> 30:50.459
To have sex with her.

30:50.461 --> 30:51.527
No.

30:51.529 --> 30:54.563
Yeah, "private tennis lesson."

30:54.565 --> 30:58.467
I've got two more scheduled
with her this week.

30:58.469 --> 31:00.236
How's that for sensitive?

31:00.237 --> 31:02.004
Not sensitive at all.
Holy shit, man!

31:02.006 --> 31:05.374
You know how I'm gonna prove
to you that Danya is real?

31:05.376 --> 31:08.577
I'm gonna fly her out
here myself.

31:08.579 --> 31:11.380
I'm gonna put her up in
a fancy bed and breakfast.

31:11.382 --> 31:14.116
I'm gonna seduce her
at fine dinners...

31:14.118 --> 31:18.153
That I pay for and
it's gonna be magic.

31:18.155 --> 31:19.521
Ha!

31:23.094 --> 31:24.326
Now, if you'll excuse me...

31:24.328 --> 31:27.196
I've gotta wash off the sight
of that.

31:38.075 --> 31:40.542
Whoo!

31:40.544 --> 31:42.211
Andy!

31:45.449 --> 31:47.349
Fuck, yeah!

31:51.188 --> 31:53.055
Andy?

31:53.057 --> 31:55.557
Victoria! Hey, looking good
out there.

31:55.559 --> 31:57.626
Thanks.

31:57.628 --> 32:02.131
Um, you know, Gabby told me that
you were giving private lessons.

32:02.133 --> 32:04.967
$150 an hour, is that right?

32:04.969 --> 32:09.371
You... you mean a full lesson?

32:09.373 --> 32:14.243
Yeah, a full lesson.

32:15.980 --> 32:18.213
Tomorrow at 4:00, okay?

32:21.252 --> 32:23.719
My schedule is open,
I can do it tomorrow, I can...

32:23.721 --> 32:26.388
My address is on the call sheet.

32:32.163 --> 32:34.163
What!

32:36.267 --> 32:38.734
Oh, you're so
much hotter than my mom!

32:48.980 --> 32:50.145
Yeah!

32:54.218 --> 32:56.618
Oh, my god!

33:16.674 --> 33:19.708
And this.

33:19.710 --> 33:22.044
I will end you... ready?

33:22.046 --> 33:25.080
S'il vous plait!
S'il vous plait... ow!

33:50.474 --> 33:52.341
And this, please.

33:54.412 --> 33:57.112
Open that pretty mouth.

34:09.627 --> 34:11.659
Another hole-in-one.

34:11.661 --> 34:16.065
Can you please stop using
Qi gong to influence the ball?

34:16.067 --> 34:17.699
This isn't fun for us.

34:17.701 --> 34:20.168
Andy, Qi gong isn't something
I can just turn on and off.

34:20.170 --> 34:24.172
Right, I'm gonna try my hand
at this.

34:24.175 --> 34:26.175
Oh, stop traffic.

34:26.177 --> 34:29.545
Yes.
Oh, my, thank you.

34:29.547 --> 34:31.813
Did you guys pay a hot
girl to follow you around?

34:31.815 --> 34:34.216
Great strategy, seriously.

34:34.217 --> 34:35.784
I think that's
Nora Sullivan, dude.

34:35.786 --> 34:38.719
Yes, my name... I'm Nora.

34:38.722 --> 34:40.222
Holy shit, you're right.

34:40.224 --> 34:42.491
Way to get in early, guys,
seriously...

34:42.493 --> 34:44.626
I like the strategy.
Hey, honestly.

34:44.628 --> 34:45.828
Are you sexually active?

34:45.830 --> 34:48.197
That's so offensive.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.630
You know what, and also,
you guys never talked to us...

34:49.632 --> 34:51.366
Before, so you don't really
get to start now.

34:51.368 --> 34:52.534
Can you just fuck off!

34:52.536 --> 34:53.635
All right, Nora.

34:53.637 --> 34:54.770
Wow.
Okay, all right...

34:54.772 --> 34:56.505
I thought she was quiet,
it's cool.

34:56.507 --> 35:00.142
Okay, we'll catch you guys
on the last hole, all right?

35:00.144 --> 35:01.477
We'll fuck off for now,
we'll be back later.

35:01.479 --> 35:03.412
Bye-ee!
Jeez...

35:03.414 --> 35:04.746
God, I hate those guys.

35:04.748 --> 35:06.582
How do they not know
people like us now?

35:06.584 --> 35:08.250
Hey man, it's just
different circles.

35:08.252 --> 35:10.252
Hey, speaking of different
circles.

35:10.254 --> 35:12.654
Now how is that "airland" doing?

35:12.656 --> 35:14.389
Erland?
Erland.

35:14.391 --> 35:16.558
Does he have talents aside
from being handsome?

35:16.560 --> 35:19.228
He tries to write pop songs.

35:19.230 --> 35:22.264
Oh, no, Australians do
have a natural sense of rhythm.

35:22.266 --> 35:25.667
Look, he's 30, you're 18,
he's not with you...

35:25.669 --> 35:28.203
Because he wants you to edit
his post-doctoral thesis.

35:28.205 --> 35:30.873
Um, I'm pretty sure that
you and I discussing...

35:30.875 --> 35:33.475
My relationship is
none of your business.

35:33.477 --> 35:34.643
Relationship?
Yes!

35:34.645 --> 35:36.645
It's a relationship?
Yes!

35:36.646 --> 35:38.646
Is he your boyfriend?
Yep... yep. He's my boyfriend.

35:38.649 --> 35:40.616
There's no way he's your
boyfriend!

35:44.722 --> 35:46.622
I'm done with mini golf...

35:46.624 --> 35:47.756
So I'll just wait in the car
for you guys?

35:47.758 --> 35:49.258
Is that cool? So...

35:52.296 --> 35:55.364
Nora?

35:55.366 --> 35:58.934
Are you serious? You're calling
her out on the age difference?

35:58.936 --> 36:01.436
Yo, lion, you know Andy here
has been having sex...

36:01.438 --> 36:02.905
With older women from the club
for money.

36:02.907 --> 36:05.841
Holy tits, you're
a hooker? Pound that shit.

36:05.843 --> 36:09.411
I'm not... thank you.
I'm not a hooker.

36:09.413 --> 36:14.516
I'm... getting some experience
and I'm teaching them lessons.

36:14.518 --> 36:16.552
Dude, they're not lessons!

36:17.721 --> 36:19.254
God...

36:23.294 --> 36:25.394
They're technically lessons.

36:48.986 --> 36:51.386
Please don't be a catfish.

37:16.347 --> 37:19.648
Are you just rhyming
my name with other girl's names?

37:19.650 --> 37:21.383
Have you tried to rhyme
your name?

37:21.385 --> 37:24.586
Girls' names are all there are.

37:26.523 --> 37:29.258
Something on your mind?

37:29.260 --> 37:34.930
I, uh, got into a fight with a
friend at mini golf, it was bad.

37:34.932 --> 37:38.000
You want to do something
to get out of your head?

37:38.002 --> 37:40.802
Well, what are you thinking?

37:47.645 --> 37:49.678
The world behind the curtains.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.480
Crap, this is so cool.

37:51.482 --> 37:54.983
And here is the autonomous
underwater vehicle, "fetch."

37:54.985 --> 37:56.885
Fetch.
Center point of our research.

37:56.887 --> 37:58.087
Uh-huh.

37:58.088 --> 37:59.288
Collector of good data
on specimens...

37:59.290 --> 38:01.623
Ranging from the Acan coral...

38:01.625 --> 38:02.791
From the Netherlands Antilles...

38:02.793 --> 38:04.726
Through to the fur seal
populations...

38:04.728 --> 38:06.428
In the Shetland islands
of Antarctica.

38:06.430 --> 38:08.930
And black hydrothermal
smoker vents in the Galapagos.

38:08.932 --> 38:12.801
That's correct, yeah,
black smoker hydrothermal vents.

38:12.803 --> 38:14.069
These things are worth like...

38:14.071 --> 38:16.705
A quarter of a million
dollars a piece.

38:16.707 --> 38:18.573
Ten more years of education...

38:18.575 --> 38:21.743
And maybe I'll feel like I
actually deserve to be in here.

38:23.981 --> 38:27.516
This is a robotics lab,
are you joking?

38:27.518 --> 38:29.718
No.

38:29.720 --> 38:32.921
Are you my boyfriend?

38:32.923 --> 38:34.923
Come on, Nora.

38:34.925 --> 38:36.658
Are you?

38:36.660 --> 38:39.428
Yes, yes, of course,
I'm your boyfriend, Nora.

38:39.430 --> 38:40.595
Hmm.

38:40.597 --> 38:42.464
I care about you.

38:42.466 --> 38:43.932
Do you?

38:43.934 --> 38:45.967
I do.

38:45.969 --> 38:47.669
How much?

38:48.806 --> 38:52.741
I... have this!

38:53.777 --> 38:54.860
Oh, my god.

38:54.861 --> 38:55.944
Okay, okay, but you've
gotta admit...

38:55.946 --> 38:57.045
You'd have a virginity story...

38:57.047 --> 38:58.513
Better than any of your friends,
right?

38:58.515 --> 39:00.782
Who the hell says
that I'm a virgin?

39:00.784 --> 39:04.052
Clearly, you've never been to a
national high school leaders...

39:04.054 --> 39:06.421
Of tomorrow conference.

39:06.423 --> 39:08.857
Yeah, clearly I haven't.

39:23.874 --> 39:25.474
Hm?

39:25.476 --> 39:26.775
What's the matter?

39:26.777 --> 39:30.045
Uh, nothing.

39:30.047 --> 39:33.682
It's just girl stuff.

39:33.684 --> 39:35.617
Client?

39:37.988 --> 39:42.124
You understand, I'm not
a prostitute, right?

39:42.126 --> 39:43.759
I'm going to Dartmouth.

39:43.761 --> 39:46.662
Well, then you should have
waited to start...

39:46.663 --> 39:49.564
Your career as a sex worker
until you got to New Hampshire.

39:49.566 --> 39:51.166
No state income tax.

39:51.168 --> 39:55.570
You think I have
to declare this?

39:55.572 --> 39:57.539
Gabby, I'm home!

39:58.709 --> 40:00.075
Whoa!
Oh, my god, you have to go!

40:00.077 --> 40:01.476
Is that...?
Go that way now!

40:01.478 --> 40:03.946
My clothes are in...

40:03.947 --> 40:06.415
I don't care, my husband's
gonna walk in this... go, go!

40:08.085 --> 40:11.153
Woo-hoo!

40:41.218 --> 40:44.085
Don't you look handsome.

40:44.087 --> 40:46.121
Stupid! You're so stupid!

40:46.123 --> 40:48.056
You are so stupid,
you are an idiot, you're dumb.

40:56.233 --> 40:58.667
No, no, no.

41:26.597 --> 41:28.997
They've made some great
additions to this course.

41:28.999 --> 41:31.032
It's challenging, but fun.

41:33.270 --> 41:37.873
They also have go-karts
at this place now.

41:37.875 --> 41:39.908
Thank you for this
blanket, by the way.

41:39.910 --> 41:41.643
Yeah, just make sure
it's all the way...

41:41.645 --> 41:43.845
Between you and the seat.

41:46.950 --> 41:49.301
Golden boy!

41:49.302 --> 41:51.653
What are you in for, naked
insider trading or something?

41:51.655 --> 41:53.855
Huh? Hey, numbers in the nude!

41:53.857 --> 41:55.891
Calculous with your cockulous?

41:55.893 --> 42:00.195
Aw... it's great
to see you, Plymouth rock.

42:00.197 --> 42:03.665
Why is he making fun
of you, you know about math?

42:03.667 --> 42:05.267
A little bit.

42:05.269 --> 42:07.736
Can I ask you something?

42:07.738 --> 42:10.171
Sure, you have me under arrest.

42:10.173 --> 42:12.607
I'm taking out a mortgage.

42:12.609 --> 42:15.010
These numbers just
don't seem to add up.

42:16.747 --> 42:19.214
I'm not a banker,
but I can take a look.

42:26.857 --> 42:31.293
Okay, so, that's it, the problem
here is that this number here...

42:31.295 --> 42:33.328
Is based on a 30-year
amortization...

42:33.330 --> 42:34.796
When you wanted a 20, right?

42:34.798 --> 42:36.481
Right.

42:36.482 --> 42:38.165
Your instincts were right,
this is a clerical error.

42:38.168 --> 42:39.668
They blew it.

42:39.670 --> 42:42.137
Hey, thank you, man.

42:42.139 --> 42:45.006
You probably saved me a ton
of money.

42:45.008 --> 42:47.175
Well, you have good reason
to be upset at your lender.

42:47.177 --> 42:50.679
Now, does this maybe
change things...

42:50.681 --> 42:54.149
In terms of the naked
in the car situation?

42:54.151 --> 42:57.852
What? No! I already
wrote it up.

42:57.854 --> 43:00.622
You know you can't
just drive around town...

43:00.624 --> 43:02.591
Showing your ass like that,
right?

43:02.593 --> 43:03.792
You know, I'm just saying...
You know that?

43:03.794 --> 43:05.961
I do you a favor,
you do me a favor.

43:05.963 --> 43:07.829
Like I rub your back,
you rub mine.

43:07.831 --> 43:09.230
Okay, I did not rub anything!

43:09.232 --> 43:10.966
I wasn't... I had a scorecard
there...

43:10.968 --> 43:13.902
Maybe you saw the outline
of things, but that's all I had.

43:13.904 --> 43:15.637
That's enough, the outline
is enough.

43:15.639 --> 43:20.375
Don't show that too tall ass
around here again.

43:27.985 --> 43:31.119
Hey, Yaco. Salvatore!
What's up?

43:31.121 --> 43:33.121
Heard about your driving
incident.

43:33.123 --> 43:37.058
Yeah, yeah, it was crazy,
just a dare gone wrong.

43:37.060 --> 43:40.161
Oh, Gabby dared you to
flee from her house naked?

43:42.699 --> 43:43.965
How do you know?

43:43.967 --> 43:46.468
I, too, am fucking Gabby.

43:46.469 --> 43:48.970
For many years now. All the
things she does with her pinky,

43:48.972 --> 43:51.339
I know all about this.
As do I!

43:51.341 --> 43:53.191
No!

43:53.192 --> 43:55.042
And now you start doing the
same and you almost get caught.

43:55.045 --> 43:58.146
If you get caught, suspicion
falls on all the pros...

43:58.148 --> 44:00.081
At the club, does it not?

44:01.985 --> 44:06.221
Such sloppy behavior we cannot
risk.

44:06.223 --> 44:10.325
No more sleeping with women.
You will ruin everything.

44:10.327 --> 44:13.228
Keep your beef and the chorizo
somewhere else...

44:13.230 --> 44:15.096
You can't tell me where
to put my chorizo.

44:15.098 --> 44:16.898
I can.
It's my chorizo...

44:16.900 --> 44:20.335
Stop giving private lessons
or you are fired.

44:20.337 --> 44:22.904
You were my apostle.

44:22.906 --> 44:26.341
Little did I know,
that apostle was... Judas.

44:26.343 --> 44:28.377
What?

44:28.378 --> 44:30.818
You betray me not with a kiss,
but with a fuck! What the fuck?

44:31.682 --> 44:33.482
Yaco...

44:33.483 --> 44:35.283
Andiamo, Salvatore.
Salvatore, you get it.

44:35.285 --> 44:36.918
No!

44:36.920 --> 44:38.953
Salvatore!

44:38.955 --> 44:41.022
Salvatore...

44:57.374 --> 44:59.941
Did you find going to
public school a disadvantage...

44:59.943 --> 45:01.476
For your college application?

45:01.478 --> 45:03.912
You know, tins, honestly
if you're smart enough...

45:03.914 --> 45:05.674
It doesn't really matter
where you come from?

45:11.121 --> 45:12.320
Now, uh...

45:12.322 --> 45:14.322
Don't worry, I got the goods
in here.

45:14.324 --> 45:16.291
Let's go.
Yeah.

45:16.293 --> 45:19.394
Wow, Mit and drugs.

45:19.396 --> 45:21.429
He'll probably solve cold
fusion his freshman year.

45:21.431 --> 45:24.199
Probably.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.968
I'm pretty sure you don't know
lion well enough...

45:26.970 --> 45:28.136
To weigh in on what
he's gonna do.

45:28.138 --> 45:29.588
Andy, what are you doing?

45:29.589 --> 45:31.039
Yeah, we're all going to college
pretty soon...

45:31.041 --> 45:32.941
What do you got going?

45:32.943 --> 45:35.376
Maybe... isn't there a kangaroo
helicopter...

45:35.378 --> 45:39.914
With like digeridoo blades
that can come grab you...

45:39.916 --> 45:42.917
And haul you back to Australia,
so you're not in my face...

45:42.919 --> 45:45.186
Every moment of the rest
of the summer?

45:45.188 --> 45:47.188
You know what, Andy,
I'm sure there is.

45:47.190 --> 45:49.858
But you see, kangaroo
helicopters with digeridoo...

45:49.860 --> 45:52.060
Blades, they breakdown pretty
easily, so...

45:52.062 --> 45:56.831
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you're a funny man!

45:56.833 --> 46:00.135
I can't stand you!

46:00.137 --> 46:03.037
One... I'm just... I'm so...
That's cool.

46:05.308 --> 46:07.108
I like you.

46:07.110 --> 46:09.310
30-year-old,
I'm gonna fuck with a dad?

46:09.312 --> 46:11.513
I'm speaking to you, Andy!

46:11.515 --> 46:13.214
Totally fucking unacceptable!

46:13.216 --> 46:17.952
What is wrong with you lately?

46:17.954 --> 46:19.354
I'll go apologize!

46:19.356 --> 46:21.122
That's not what I want, I want
you to tell me...

46:21.124 --> 46:23.324
What is going on right now!

46:24.795 --> 46:26.561
There's three weeks left
of summer...

46:26.563 --> 46:29.831
And I don't want to share
that time with "airland."

46:29.833 --> 46:31.032
Well, his name is Erland.

46:31.034 --> 46:32.133
Whatever.

46:32.135 --> 46:33.968
And he's not even around
that much.

46:33.970 --> 46:35.203
He's around whenever
you're around.

46:35.205 --> 46:36.571
He's my boyfriend.

46:36.573 --> 46:38.957
Right.

46:38.958 --> 46:41.342
Whoa, why are you like
trying to ruin this for me?

46:41.344 --> 46:43.178
I'm not trying! Why are you...

46:43.180 --> 46:44.763
Why did you do...

46:44.764 --> 46:46.347
Dude, what did I do, just tell
me what I did, what did I do?

46:46.349 --> 46:48.049
You got a guy and
you're all lovey dovey...

46:48.051 --> 46:49.517
You're just some type of person
you never were before!

46:49.519 --> 46:50.852
Whoa, so you're...

46:50.854 --> 46:52.137
You're blossoming right now...

46:52.138 --> 46:53.421
And you're not supposed to
blossom right now.

46:53.423 --> 46:56.157
I'm sorry, but it should
be us together!

47:02.899 --> 47:06.601
Um... okay.

47:11.875 --> 47:14.375
I had no clue that you
felt this way.

47:16.146 --> 47:18.413
How do you feel
this way about me?

47:18.415 --> 47:21.850
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't... I just do.

47:23.587 --> 47:25.153
That would be really weird.

47:25.155 --> 47:27.555
No, it wouldn't.
Yeah, yes, it would.

47:27.557 --> 47:29.123
It doesn't have to be.
Yeah, no, how about this.

47:29.125 --> 47:30.575
Whoa, whoa!

47:30.576 --> 47:32.026
See, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

47:32.028 --> 47:34.112
Stop...

47:34.113 --> 47:36.197
Come here, let me show you
something else. Come here.

47:36.199 --> 47:37.866
Can you come closer?

47:40.203 --> 47:42.103
I want you to fuck me.

47:42.105 --> 47:43.171
What?

47:43.173 --> 47:44.439
I want you to fuck me.

47:44.441 --> 47:46.441
Stop!

47:46.442 --> 47:48.442
Okay, then why don't you try?
You say something dirty to me.

47:48.445 --> 47:50.011
Try.

47:50.013 --> 47:54.249
F... finger me.
No... finger you.

47:54.251 --> 47:56.017
Okay, all right.
You... I will...

47:56.019 --> 47:58.353
That's exactly, hmm. So...

47:58.355 --> 48:00.355
Okay, okay, okay.
We know each other too well.

48:00.357 --> 48:01.556
You've proven your point.

48:03.393 --> 48:07.395
I feel so weird.

48:07.397 --> 48:08.997
I'm sor... I'm sorry?

48:08.999 --> 48:12.233
Whatever, like there's a beach
full of girls...

48:12.235 --> 48:14.369
That think you're really cool,
for whatever reason...

48:14.371 --> 48:16.571
And only I know the
truth, so let's just...

48:16.573 --> 48:20.942
I forgot already. Didn't happen,
and it's never gonna happen.

48:20.944 --> 48:25.947
So, let's just forget about it.

48:29.119 --> 48:30.952
Hold on.

48:30.954 --> 48:32.086
What, who is it?

48:32.088 --> 48:35.323
Private tennis lesson,
I'm on call.

48:35.325 --> 48:37.659
What do you mean, you're gonna
go do a private tennis lesson...

48:37.661 --> 48:39.160
When you're... you've
been drinking!

48:39.162 --> 48:43.531
I agree, it isn't
entirely professional.

48:43.533 --> 48:45.066
Does this have something
to do...

48:45.068 --> 48:47.035
With why you've been driving
around naked?

48:49.673 --> 48:52.240
You whore!

48:58.248 --> 49:01.983
So, the lion has gone
full-blown crazy.

49:01.985 --> 49:05.353
Yeah, he taught me the
quivering hand technique...

49:05.355 --> 49:07.588
With his palm, you know?

49:07.590 --> 49:08.723
The touch of death?

49:08.725 --> 49:11.059
Yeah, the touch of death.

49:11.061 --> 49:12.660
Seems irresponsible.

49:12.662 --> 49:14.662
I mean, he was high
when he told me.

49:14.664 --> 49:17.098
No, no, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

49:17.100 --> 49:19.367
Watch that thing, easy does it!

49:19.369 --> 49:23.271
Pardon me, man.

49:23.272 --> 49:27.174
Hey, airland! Let's have a chat.
I am sorry about earlier.

49:27.177 --> 49:29.310
You're an ass, Andy.

49:29.312 --> 49:33.348
Maybe I have been recently,
but if you hurt her...

49:33.350 --> 49:35.650
I will kill you.

49:35.652 --> 49:38.586
Okay. Come on.

49:39.756 --> 49:41.289
Nailed it.

49:41.291 --> 49:43.691
I don't think he's
coming back, either.

49:43.693 --> 49:46.761
Hello?

49:46.763 --> 49:51.265
Hi, Diana. You know what?

49:51.267 --> 49:54.302
Private lessons are over.

49:56.573 --> 50:02.076
Okay... they're back on and
I will be there in 20 minutes.

50:02.078 --> 50:04.545
Thank you.
No, no, what?

50:04.547 --> 50:09.484
I'm sorry, a client just
offered me a thousand dollars

50:09.486 --> 50:10.551
for a lesson.

50:10.553 --> 50:13.454
A lesson? A client?

50:13.456 --> 50:15.189
Dude, you don't even have your
tennis racket with you...

50:15.191 --> 50:16.724
Listen to yourself.

50:16.725 --> 50:18.258
What the hell's happening
with my friends this summer?

50:18.261 --> 50:21.496
It's like I'm the only one
that's being me. That's me.

50:21.498 --> 50:23.197
Last one and I'm out.

50:23.199 --> 50:26.501
Okay, so, one last big gig
before retirement?

50:26.503 --> 50:28.503
That's real mature, I'm sure
that's what they all say.

50:28.505 --> 50:31.506
What are you doing? Dude!

50:40.316 --> 50:42.617
Diana!

50:50.593 --> 50:52.727
Diana?

50:59.335 --> 51:01.469
Hello?

51:04.707 --> 51:06.474
Diana?

51:06.476 --> 51:08.676
Andy?

51:08.678 --> 51:13.414
Huh? What?
Conch, what are you doing?

51:13.416 --> 51:15.516
What you... babysitting.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.620
Someone let you babysit?

51:19.622 --> 51:22.723
What the hell's that supposed
to mean?

51:22.725 --> 51:26.394
Wait, I've never seen you sober.

51:26.396 --> 51:29.430
You think I do my job drunk?

51:29.432 --> 51:31.799
That's messed up, man.
Hey, get in here.

51:36.139 --> 51:37.605
Sit, sit, sit.

51:39.275 --> 51:44.245
Hey, so, what are you
doing here?

51:48.585 --> 51:52.153
I was at a party.

51:52.155 --> 51:53.654
Yeah?

51:53.656 --> 51:55.823
And I'm looking for a Diana.

51:55.825 --> 51:57.458
You mean, Ms. Bradfield?

51:57.460 --> 51:59.327
Yeah, she lives next door.

51:59.329 --> 52:01.195
Oh.

52:01.197 --> 52:03.264
Weird person to be looking
for in your current state.

52:03.266 --> 52:05.233
Ah!

52:05.235 --> 52:10.171
Seriously? Yo, this is Andy,
we went to high school together.

52:10.173 --> 52:13.441
Hello, child.

52:13.443 --> 52:16.878
So, can't believe you were
at a party.

52:16.880 --> 52:18.913
You never came to our parties.

52:18.915 --> 52:24.152
He, we never, we were
never invited to his parties.

52:24.154 --> 52:28.289
Nobody's ever invited,
they just show up.

52:28.291 --> 52:29.790
That's what a party is.

52:29.792 --> 52:33.794
That doesn't really...
Really apply to us, though.

52:33.796 --> 52:38.566
Are you stupid? Because nobody
ever disliked you guys.

52:38.568 --> 52:41.536
You guys are the ones
who stayed away.

52:41.538 --> 52:43.471
You exiled yourselves.

52:46.676 --> 52:48.376
Hard truths.

52:50.213 --> 52:51.779
Anyway, shake it off, listen.

52:51.781 --> 52:53.848
You should come to the
summer dump party.

52:53.850 --> 52:56.851
Yeah, and I know how important
it is for you to feel special...

52:56.853 --> 52:59.820
So, you can be my honored
guests.

52:59.822 --> 53:02.523
Summer dump?

53:02.525 --> 53:05.226
I would love that. When is it?

53:05.228 --> 53:07.378
Same time every year.
Last weekend in August.

53:07.379 --> 53:09.529
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta get back to babysitting.

53:09.532 --> 53:11.899
Okay? I'm sure Diana
is waiting for you.

53:11.901 --> 53:13.801
Ooh, bro, you should
have taken her to prom!

53:13.803 --> 53:16.370
Seriously, given her age,
she could've chaperoned...

53:16.372 --> 53:19.640
And been your date. Come on,
Andy, think about these things.

53:19.642 --> 53:21.642
Conch.
Yeah?

53:21.644 --> 53:23.744
Dude, you're my friend now.

53:24.647 --> 53:25.913
Bye!

53:39.495 --> 53:40.595
Send.

54:24.474 --> 54:27.975
Punch... throw a kick, punch.

54:32.982 --> 54:34.649
What is going...

54:45.695 --> 54:50.798
What? Keep busy, guys,
just keep doing your thing, man.

54:50.800 --> 54:52.667
Punch!

54:55.505 --> 54:56.904
Oh, man.

55:02.045 --> 55:05.613
She's 18... yes, 18.

55:07.083 --> 55:10.318
Of course, you're not
a replacement.

55:10.320 --> 55:14.021
I want you in my bed...

55:14.023 --> 55:17.658
And this weekend will be
perfect, yeah.

55:17.660 --> 55:20.394
Really?

55:28.638 --> 55:29.970
Fuck.

55:32.108 --> 55:34.709
Hey, Andy, looking good.

55:34.711 --> 55:39.547
Hey! No, you look good,
you do!

55:39.549 --> 55:41.882
Sit down!
No, no!

55:43.353 --> 55:44.852
We told you, Andy, no more sex!

55:46.989 --> 55:49.724
Gabby's husband called
asking if either of us...

55:49.726 --> 55:53.394
Had lost a headband, which he
found in his bedroom.

55:53.396 --> 55:54.762
Aw, that's where that one went.

55:54.764 --> 55:55.830
Ow!

55:57.133 --> 55:59.433
Okay, okay, easy, easy.

55:59.435 --> 56:01.936
Look, look, let's form an
alliance together, let's work...

56:01.938 --> 56:04.238
Ow!

56:04.239 --> 56:06.539
Shh. Such sloppiness has no
place at the pro shop.

56:06.542 --> 56:10.544
You're fired. And if anyone else
comes sniffing around here...

56:10.546 --> 56:12.880
Looking for the man
who's been with their wives...

56:12.882 --> 56:16.717
I will give them your name.

56:16.719 --> 56:20.688
You flew too close to the sun.
Judas...

56:20.690 --> 56:22.656
The pussy sun.

56:24.093 --> 56:28.496
Salvatore...
No, Andy, not today!

56:34.137 --> 56:37.671
I called Yaco about it, he swore
up and down it wasn't his.

56:37.673 --> 56:41.509
It's a fact, Yaco isn't
into women.

56:41.511 --> 56:43.477
He'd never touch your wife.

56:43.479 --> 56:45.012
She's not into Italians...

56:45.014 --> 56:47.882
So, Salavatore is out.

56:47.884 --> 56:49.683
Did you ask her about Andy?

56:49.685 --> 56:53.421
The high school kid? No. Why?

56:53.423 --> 56:55.055
Because
when Victoria had too much...

56:55.057 --> 56:59.627
To drink the other night,
she told me she slept with him.

56:59.629 --> 57:05.433
I'll talk to the other guys,
see what they know about it.

57:11.607 --> 57:12.873
Thanks.

57:20.883 --> 57:22.450
What happened this morning,
guys?

57:22.452 --> 57:25.786
Oh, nothing, lion and
I lost our jobs...

57:25.788 --> 57:30.191
And Nora found out Erland is
sleeping with somebody else, so-

57:30.193 --> 57:32.626
who knew that peyote would stay
in my system for three days?

57:32.628 --> 57:35.629
God, I'm so stupid to cut
it that close, man.

57:35.631 --> 57:37.598
Easy.

57:37.600 --> 57:40.201
Guys, I'm done with drugs
and alcohol.

57:40.203 --> 57:42.770
Okay, a warrior needs
his mind to be sharp.

57:42.772 --> 57:46.574
At least the summer's almost
over, so...

57:46.576 --> 57:50.811
Almost... we got
invited to summer dump.

57:50.813 --> 57:52.480
Oh, my god!
Are you serious?

57:52.482 --> 57:54.748
No way.
You're not...

57:54.750 --> 57:56.917
You guys don't' want to...
You wanna go?

57:56.919 --> 58:00.521
No, no, I mean, I'm exhausted,
you guys.

58:00.523 --> 58:03.958
I vote that we just
cut our losses.

58:03.960 --> 58:06.193
No! Our group has been
disintegrating this summer.

58:06.195 --> 58:09.029
You two have been fighting each
other, you fried your brain...

58:09.031 --> 58:13.067
And I've... I mean, not much has
happened for me, I realize that.

58:13.069 --> 58:14.869
It probably should have by
now and I'm not too happy...

58:14.871 --> 58:16.871
With my progression,
either, but...

58:16.873 --> 58:19.139
This is the last time we're
gonna be together like this...

58:19.141 --> 58:21.075
So, we're going to summer dump!

58:21.077 --> 58:23.811
Okay.

58:25.114 --> 58:30.251
Sorry. Some weird number.

58:30.253 --> 58:32.052
Hello?

58:32.054 --> 58:35.789
Danya
Andy? It's Danya.

58:35.791 --> 58:39.760
Danya? Hi!

58:39.762 --> 58:42.296
Danya I'm at the shuttle
bus stop in Hyannis.

58:42.298 --> 58:44.298
I got a transfer from Boston.

58:44.300 --> 58:46.834
You're at the shuttle bus stop?

58:46.836 --> 58:49.770
Danya you got my
emails I was coming, right?

58:49.772 --> 58:52.172
Oh, you didn't check your spam
folder, did you?

58:52.174 --> 58:54.108
Your email? Of course,
I got your emails.

58:54.110 --> 58:56.277
I'm gonna come get you,
I'm gonna come right now.

58:56.279 --> 58:57.845
I'll be there in ten minutes.

58:57.847 --> 59:00.114
Danya okay, Andy, I'm excited.

59:00.116 --> 59:02.283
Me, too, me, too!
Okay, bye.

59:07.723 --> 59:12.993
So, Danya is real and she is
here and I'm gonna go get her.

59:12.995 --> 59:14.962
She just like showed up
out of the blue?

59:14.964 --> 59:16.830
Indians are spontaneous
like that.

59:16.832 --> 59:18.599
Gandhi was pretty patient.

59:18.601 --> 59:20.390
Shut up.

59:20.391 --> 59:22.180
You know I'm coming,
right, I have to see this.

59:22.181 --> 59:23.970
Yeah, no, me, too, because I
can't go back to the lab, so.

59:23.973 --> 59:25.906
I have work, so I'll be
staying here.

59:25.908 --> 59:27.641
Good, yes, all of you
stay here...

59:27.643 --> 59:29.810
Because you'll freak her out
if you come.

59:35.685 --> 59:39.687
Oh, the Internet is awesome.
Okay.

59:43.993 --> 59:48.195
Hi! This is...

59:51.200 --> 59:52.766
Oh, that's nice.

59:52.768 --> 59:54.635
Oh, my god.

59:56.973 --> 59:58.105
Ah, she sees me.

59:58.107 --> 01:00:01.275
Who are those people?

01:00:01.277 --> 01:00:03.711
Oh, they came with the car.

01:00:07.617 --> 01:00:10.150
You can't understand
anything about the world...

01:00:10.152 --> 01:00:13.187
If you don't read Amartya sen's
"inequality re-examined."

01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:15.122
Okay, but I read,
"development as freedom."

01:00:15.124 --> 01:00:18.058
That's just an appetizer
for "inequality re-examined."

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.096
You'll have to feed me dinner.

01:00:23.966 --> 01:00:25.733
Hey, have you ever read,
intuition...

01:00:25.735 --> 01:00:27.267
Lion!
Sorry.

01:00:31.307 --> 01:00:32.773
Okay...

01:00:32.775 --> 01:00:38.946
Um, that should...
That should cover it.

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:42.916
Thank you.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.791
Oh. Oh, yes.

01:00:50.793 --> 01:00:54.928
Where did you get so much
cash to pay for this place?

01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:57.431
I'm a sperm donor.

01:00:57.433 --> 01:00:59.967
You must be exhausted.

01:01:01.837 --> 01:01:04.872
I am so glad you're here.

01:01:04.874 --> 01:01:06.140
Me, too.

01:01:12.281 --> 01:01:17.351
Um, I have to go in there
all of a sudden...

01:01:17.353 --> 01:01:22.690
But I'm gonna come back here
and then, we're just...

01:01:22.692 --> 01:01:25.926
We're just never leaving.
Okay?

01:01:25.928 --> 01:01:27.161
Okay.

01:01:27.163 --> 01:01:28.962
All right, I'll be right back.

01:01:47.983 --> 01:01:51.885
Ow! Oh, god, fire.

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:58.792
Hot, hot burn. Oh, my god!

01:02:09.772 --> 01:02:12.906
Something is wrong...
Something is wrong.

01:02:17.413 --> 01:02:24.852
Okay, so... I have to go now,
I have to go do something.

01:02:24.854 --> 01:02:26.420
You're leaving?

01:02:26.422 --> 01:02:28.922
It's nothing weird,
I just gotta go. Okay?

01:02:28.924 --> 01:02:30.457
I'll be back, I'll be back.

01:02:33.863 --> 01:02:36.230
Looks like you have
a yeast infection.

01:02:36.232 --> 01:02:38.532
A yeast infection?

01:02:38.534 --> 01:02:40.951
Men get yeast infections, too.

01:02:40.952 --> 01:02:43.369
Particularly if you're having a
lot of intercourse...

01:02:43.372 --> 01:02:44.938
And your immune system
is suppressed...

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.106
Which would be the case...

01:02:46.108 --> 01:02:48.175
If you've been drinking
a lot of alcohol.

01:02:48.177 --> 01:02:50.811
Oh, my god.

01:02:50.813 --> 01:02:53.781
Lucky for you, it's curable with
a seven-day course of treatment.

01:02:53.783 --> 01:02:55.816
Any way we could speed that up?

01:02:55.818 --> 01:02:59.186
Some women have success putting
non-sweetened probiotic yogurt..

01:02:59.188 --> 01:03:02.156
Directly on the infection.

01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:06.393
Nope. No, no, no.
This can't be happening...

01:03:06.395 --> 01:03:08.061
I've been very careful.

01:03:08.063 --> 01:03:11.198
You've been having a lot
of sex, Andy.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.033
I know.

01:03:13.034 --> 01:03:14.867
Lay off sex for the next week
and you'll be fine.

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.838
Lay off for the next week?
I can't.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.842
Yes, you can... okay?

01:03:21.844 --> 01:03:26.213
I gotta... can I pay for this
visit in cash?

01:03:26.215 --> 01:03:29.216
I don't want my parents
to see my insurance bill.

01:03:29.218 --> 01:03:31.218
It's a paper trail thing.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.321
You've had sex with 15 women
in the past two months...

01:03:34.323 --> 01:03:37.591
And you carry that kind of cash?

01:03:37.593 --> 01:03:38.992
Yes.

01:03:38.994 --> 01:03:40.394
Who are you?

01:03:40.396 --> 01:03:42.496
I don't even know anymore.

01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:47.901
And you're certain, she's not a
spy sent to kill you...

01:03:47.903 --> 01:03:50.003
Or some shit, bro?

01:03:51.073 --> 01:03:53.440
Going for a walk.

01:03:53.442 --> 01:03:56.476
Andy, Andy come in!

01:03:56.478 --> 01:04:00.180
I can't hear you.

01:04:00.182 --> 01:04:04.251
What? You can absolutely
hear her, bro.

01:04:04.253 --> 01:04:07.020
Can't hear you, either.

01:04:07.022 --> 01:04:09.623
I'm just craving it right now.
I don't even...

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:11.625
If you wanna know one thing
about me...

01:04:11.627 --> 01:04:14.528
It's that I love yogurt.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:20.334
Oh, yeah, you know, that's the
one.

01:04:20.336 --> 01:04:22.936
That's the one, I love this
stuff.

01:04:22.938 --> 01:04:24.571
This is gonna do the trick.

01:04:41.457 --> 01:04:44.191
No... fuck it.

01:04:47.363 --> 01:04:49.296
Ah, yes.

01:04:52.167 --> 01:04:58.605
Oh, my gosh, my stomach is
killing me from those clams.

01:05:13.355 --> 01:05:17.057
Hey, where have you been?
Been calling you.

01:05:17.059 --> 01:05:20.527
I've been looking for your
dick under this microscope.

01:05:20.529 --> 01:05:23.330
Um, what?

01:05:25.334 --> 01:05:30.570
I, uh, I heard you, heard you
talking to a girl on the phone..

01:05:30.572 --> 01:05:36.243
The other day about how I was 18
and you could use a replacement?

01:05:36.245 --> 01:05:37.577
I believe that's how you put it.

01:05:37.579 --> 01:05:41.014
Does that ring any bells?
So you just fuck off!

01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:13.313
This is it.

01:06:13.315 --> 01:06:17.250
Alcohol's in here, right?

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.638
Identify yourselves.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:18.211
Uh... Andy, spice,
lion and Nora.

01:07:18.213 --> 01:07:19.746
Who's the hot girl?

01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:26.386
Nora. And... Danya!
Danya, also.

01:07:26.388 --> 01:07:30.157
Holy shit!
It's the smart kids!

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:36.663
And have you come
for precious metals...

01:07:36.665 --> 01:07:39.733
For your space laboratories?

01:07:39.735 --> 01:07:41.468
We came to hang out!

01:07:45.674 --> 01:07:48.842
You heard them!
They wanna hang...

01:07:48.844 --> 01:07:50.844
And they have extra brain cells.

01:07:50.846 --> 01:07:54.347
Find them and destroy them!

01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:57.350
Whoo! Conch!

01:07:58.787 --> 01:08:01.788
Hell, yeah, this is gonna be...

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:04.291
This is Danya, this is Danya.
No shit, how you doing?

01:08:04.293 --> 01:08:06.626
She's from India.
She came from India.

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:08.395
You got hot!

01:08:08.397 --> 01:08:09.696
Thank you.

01:08:09.698 --> 01:08:12.332
You used to not be hot.

01:08:12.334 --> 01:08:13.800
I know.

01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:15.569
But now you're hot.

01:08:15.571 --> 01:08:18.371
Thank you, thank you.

01:08:18.372 --> 01:08:19.673
Hot.

01:08:23.178 --> 01:08:26.279
Woo!

01:08:32.187 --> 01:08:37.791
Goddamn, the palate on that is
wrong, it's so wrong. Let's see.

01:08:42.598 --> 01:08:44.865
This will fuck people up.

01:08:44.867 --> 01:08:47.200
What are you doing
with that punch?

01:08:47.202 --> 01:08:49.202
I'm improving it. Here.

01:08:51.773 --> 01:08:53.573
Try it.

01:09:03.484 --> 01:09:06.252
It's great.
Huh?

01:09:23.404 --> 01:09:25.639
Andy Evans!

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.808
Recipient of the
role of distinction award.

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:31.411
Being this is your first
summer dump...

01:09:31.412 --> 01:09:33.913
This is your initiation!

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:36.349
Foam mattress wrestling!

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.220
I'm not doing that.

01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:42.456
I'm not doing that, uh-uh.

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:44.691
The role of distinction award
is given to the student...

01:09:44.693 --> 01:09:46.560
That best exemplifies the
principles...

01:09:46.562 --> 01:09:48.627
Of academic excellence...

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:51.865
Loyalty and service
to the rest of the class.

01:09:51.867 --> 01:09:53.600
Ring girls, prepare him.

01:09:55.453 --> 01:09:57.303
To demonstrate those
principles...

01:09:57.306 --> 01:10:01.875
Your champion, Andy will be
wrestling... Plymouth rock!

01:10:14.223 --> 01:10:15.422
Do you think you're smart?

01:10:15.424 --> 01:10:16.590
What?

01:10:16.592 --> 01:10:17.958
I said, do... you...

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.994
Think... you're... smart?

01:10:20.996 --> 01:10:23.897
Not anymore, I don't.
Oh, no!

01:10:25.267 --> 01:10:26.633
Let go!

01:10:39.948 --> 01:10:41.681
Come on, Andy! Come on!

01:11:03.438 --> 01:11:07.007
Okay, put him down!
Put him down!

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:20.687
Get up... get the fuck
up... get the fuck up!

01:11:54.423 --> 01:11:59.059
Andy! Andy! Andy, Andy!

01:12:12.908 --> 01:12:15.608
Sorry, my hands are chapped.

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:17.844
It's...
I do yardwork.

01:12:17.846 --> 01:12:19.779
It's just... keep going,
keep going.

01:12:24.553 --> 01:12:26.953
You're doing me next, you know.

01:12:26.955 --> 01:12:29.656
Release!

01:12:32.728 --> 01:12:34.527
Hey, lion.

01:12:36.064 --> 01:12:37.831
You okay?

01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:43.069
I came from India thinking it
was going to be this...

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:49.609
Romantic trip, but... I don't
think Andy even likes me.

01:12:49.611 --> 01:12:53.713
I've been here a week and
he hasn't touched me.

01:12:55.884 --> 01:13:00.387
He hasn't touched you?

01:13:00.389 --> 01:13:02.689
But you're so beautiful.

01:13:02.691 --> 01:13:05.959
I mean you're like Krishna's
bride, Bhadra.

01:13:14.469 --> 01:13:18.104
You wanna go somewhere
and talk about this?

01:13:18.106 --> 01:13:22.675
Aren't we talking about it
somewhere now?

01:13:22.677 --> 01:13:29.916
I mean, yeah, but there are
other somewheres.

01:13:50.505 --> 01:13:52.572
What is it?

01:13:56.611 --> 01:14:01.481
Thought I sensed something...
Fuck it.

01:14:02.818 --> 01:14:04.784
My body gets so hot.

01:14:04.786 --> 01:14:06.119
Tell the story.

01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:08.955
I have zero muscles,
I have zero muscles.

01:14:08.957 --> 01:14:11.024
Epic, man.
Dude, thank you, thank you.

01:14:19.968 --> 01:14:24.971
What?

01:14:24.973 --> 01:14:26.806
Hi, mom.

01:14:26.808 --> 01:14:28.007
Mrs. Evans
Andy, where are you?

01:14:28.009 --> 01:14:30.076
I'm watching a movie.

01:14:30.078 --> 01:14:32.045
Time to eat your own dick, Andy.

01:14:32.047 --> 01:14:33.047
I have to go.

01:14:36.852 --> 01:14:40.019
I love you. I know you know
that, but I need to express...

01:14:40.021 --> 01:14:43.056
It to you right now, verbally,
before I die.

01:14:43.058 --> 01:14:48.261
No guy has ever said that
to me verbally, before death.

01:14:48.263 --> 01:14:51.264
How could anybody not love you?

01:14:51.266 --> 01:14:53.633
Hey, Andy!

01:14:53.635 --> 01:14:55.268
All right, all right,
all right, I'll be honest.

01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:57.904
I have conflicting thoughts
about what has happened over...

01:14:57.906 --> 01:14:59.506
The last couple months
and I am sorry.

01:14:59.508 --> 01:15:01.841
And if I were you guys,
I would be just as mad.

01:15:01.843 --> 01:15:03.943
I fucked your wives,
for god's sake.

01:15:03.945 --> 01:15:08.581
But I got a yeast infection,
that sucks... it really sucks.

01:15:08.583 --> 01:15:11.784
Also, which one
of you is Gabby's husband?

01:15:11.786 --> 01:15:14.220
Gabby, now, Gabby does this
thing with her pinky, right?

01:15:14.222 --> 01:15:16.956
That hurts a lot, feels good,
but it hurts so much...

01:15:16.958 --> 01:15:19.292
And I've had to ice most
days of the summer.

01:15:19.294 --> 01:15:20.760
I just want to say that also.

01:15:20.762 --> 01:15:24.731
So, I am a victim here
as well... right?

01:15:27.969 --> 01:15:30.303
You're an idiot.

01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:43.583
This has nothing to do with you!

01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:45.051
Lion, you sure
you wanna do this?

01:15:45.053 --> 01:15:49.155
Fuck, yeah, bro, it's a totally
justifiable use of force.

01:16:01.903 --> 01:16:03.636
In a mob, you gotta use
the low Thai kicks.

01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:12.345
Lion!

01:16:12.347 --> 01:16:14.914
This is about my wife.

01:16:14.916 --> 01:16:18.217
I'm sorry, bro...
This is about my friend.

01:16:27.195 --> 01:16:31.230
Oh, my god!

01:16:36.304 --> 01:16:38.271
Fuck yeah!

01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:45.044
You're amazing!
I got you!

01:16:45.046 --> 01:16:46.145
I love you!
We did it!

01:16:46.147 --> 01:16:47.880
I actually love you!

01:16:47.882 --> 01:16:49.882
Holy shit! What the fuck!

01:16:49.884 --> 01:16:52.318
Oh, my god! Holy shit!
They're dead.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.953
I think they're all dead!

01:16:57.325 --> 01:16:59.258
Oh, my.

01:17:01.029 --> 01:17:05.298
Hey, guys. What'd I miss?

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.035
Uh, I mean... I don't
even know where to start.

01:17:09.037 --> 01:17:12.105
It's been the longest
night, I think we gotta call it.

01:17:12.107 --> 01:17:15.742
Okay, I'm chillin'.

01:17:15.744 --> 01:17:17.243
Why do you seem so relaxed?

01:17:17.245 --> 01:17:20.279
You know what, I'm just feeling
refreshed, you know?

01:17:20.281 --> 01:17:22.315
Release?

01:17:22.317 --> 01:17:23.383
I've been released.

01:17:23.385 --> 01:17:25.718
Oh, man!

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.121
Congratulations.
It's your moment.

01:17:28.123 --> 01:17:29.322
I'm so proud of you.

01:17:29.324 --> 01:17:31.157
Hey!

01:17:31.159 --> 01:17:33.760
Don't hide it, I already saw it,
why would you hide it?

01:17:33.762 --> 01:17:35.094
Where would you hide it?

01:17:35.096 --> 01:17:39.966
Wearing a sock as a shirt...
What the hell?

01:17:44.105 --> 01:17:47.073
Who did this?

01:17:47.075 --> 01:17:48.808
I did, sir.

01:17:50.311 --> 01:17:52.178
They deserve it?

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:54.347
They were trying to kill Andy.

01:17:54.349 --> 01:17:55.448
Too tall.

01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:57.684
You remember me?

01:17:57.685 --> 01:17:59.919
Absolutely. Got my
mortgage situation fixed.

01:17:59.921 --> 01:18:01.454
That means you got your
arrest fixed.

01:18:01.456 --> 01:18:02.889
Really?

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:05.008
Mm-hm. Come on with it.

01:18:05.009 --> 01:18:07.126
Hey, thank you, thank
you. I was drinking a beer...

01:18:07.128 --> 01:18:10.263
Looks like there's nothing
to see out here. Right?

01:18:10.265 --> 01:18:12.165
You kids want a ride?

01:18:12.167 --> 01:18:14.467
In a cop car?
That would be awesome.

01:18:14.469 --> 01:18:15.768
Let's go.

01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:17.370
Okay...
Absolutely.

01:18:17.372 --> 01:18:19.205
Can you put on the sirens?

01:18:23.044 --> 01:18:26.112
Yes! Legend!

01:18:39.828 --> 01:18:42.428
Reach out and get that.

01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:44.964
Yep... that's it.

01:18:49.838 --> 01:18:51.370
Thanks, guys.

01:18:51.372 --> 01:18:54.841
Hey, good luck at college, Andy.

01:18:54.843 --> 01:18:56.375
Appreciate it.

01:18:58.113 --> 01:19:02.181
Mom... breathe. I'm okay.

01:19:07.222 --> 01:19:09.756
The last few days...

01:19:09.758 --> 01:19:13.259
I've never experienced
anything like it.

01:19:13.261 --> 01:19:17.063
I had no idea those positions
had a use outside of karate.

01:19:17.065 --> 01:19:19.265
Visit me as soon as you can.

01:19:19.267 --> 01:19:20.783
Let's shoot for winter break.

01:19:20.784 --> 01:19:22.300
I'm planning on being a
millionaire near the end...

01:19:22.303 --> 01:19:26.005
Of the first semester anyway,
so, we'll go somewhere nice.

01:19:32.514 --> 01:19:34.380
They're actually pretty cute.

01:19:41.956 --> 01:19:44.323
Bye, Andy, good luck
at university!

01:19:44.325 --> 01:19:49.128
Thank you! Bye, Danya!
Good luck at UCLA.

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:53.499
You're an ass! Do you know how
much it cost me...

01:19:53.501 --> 01:19:56.035
To fly her over here
and then you end up with her?

01:19:56.037 --> 01:19:59.071
As the Japanese proverb goes...

01:19:59.073 --> 01:20:02.441
"Nokorimono Ni wa fuku Ga aru."

01:20:02.443 --> 01:20:04.377
What does that mean?

01:20:06.381 --> 01:20:09.015
"Luck exists in the leftovers."

01:20:33.575 --> 01:20:37.910
What?
Yep.

01:20:37.912 --> 01:20:40.179
It's not fun.

01:20:40.181 --> 01:20:42.982
Hey, thanks for saving my life.

01:20:42.984 --> 01:20:45.318
Come on, bro, you would
have done the same for me.

01:20:46.554 --> 01:20:49.088
Love you.
Love you, man.

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:55.328
Was a kick-ass summer, guys.

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.898
Yeah, kinda sucks, though,
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:00.366
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

01:21:00.368 --> 01:21:06.072
And it does suck but...
We're gonna be okay.

01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:09.141
You better make people
call you spice at Stanford.

01:21:09.143 --> 01:21:12.144
I don't know, man, I think I'm
gonna kick it off with, Mike.

01:21:12.146 --> 01:21:14.530
Mike?

01:21:14.531 --> 01:21:16.915
See where it evolves from
there. What's wrong with that?

01:21:28.329 --> 01:21:30.062
Hey!

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.508
See you, guys.
Bye.

01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:44.210
Hey, I miss you guys already!

01:21:44.212 --> 01:21:45.611
Love you!

01:21:47.448 --> 01:21:48.448
Ow!

01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:04.814
Next time, I'm gonna see you...

01:22:04.815 --> 01:22:06.999
You're gonna have a Dartmouth
meathead beer gut.

01:22:07.001 --> 01:22:10.002
Next time I see you, you'll
be pregnant by a Kennedy.

01:22:10.004 --> 01:22:13.572
Cool, we'll just hang around
admiring each other's bellies.

01:22:13.574 --> 01:22:15.508
Love it.
Perfect.

01:22:18.713 --> 01:22:22.048
Don't make any new friends
at school, please.

01:22:22.050 --> 01:22:25.384
Okay... you, either.

01:22:25.386 --> 01:22:27.253
Deal.

01:22:27.255 --> 01:22:30.089
I love you, too.

01:22:30.091 --> 01:22:35.494
I just didn't say it at that
weird, evil steel mill.

01:22:35.496 --> 01:22:38.364
You know, it was a bad setting.

01:24:14.529 --> 01:24:16.295
Hey, Andy, heads up!

01:24:17.765 --> 01:24:20.232
Hey, Tinsley.
Hey.

01:24:22.837 --> 01:24:26.772
Nicely done. Automatic.

01:24:26.774 --> 01:24:29.308
Thanks. I'm Andy.

01:24:31.746 --> 01:24:33.479
Hey.
