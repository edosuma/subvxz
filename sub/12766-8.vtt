09:14.917 --> 09:17.583
I CAN'T LIE TO HIM.
I, UH, I-I--I'M GONNA
LET THAT GO FOR NOW.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.083
I'M--I'M ALSO GONNA OVERLOOK
THE FACT THAT YOU TWO HAVE BEEN

09:20.125 --> 09:23.041
CHRISTMAS AND EASTERING IT
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.
(laughs)

09:23.083 --> 09:25.041
LOOK, I CALLED YOU
ABOUT ONE OF THE NUNS.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.041
IT'S SISTER HELEN.
SHE'S SICK.

09:27.083 --> 09:30.291
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
SHE'S 86. SHE HATES HOSPITALS.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.583
I THOUGHT OF YOU TWO.
SAM, THIS IS YOUR AREA.

09:32.625 --> 09:35.166
NAOMI,
I THOUGHT HAVING A WOMAN

09:35.208 --> 09:37.917
WOULD MAKE HER
MORE COMFORTABLE.
H-HAS SHE BEEN ILL
FOR A WHILE?

09:37.959 --> 09:40.208
UH, SISTER AMY WOULD KNOW.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.041
THE SISTERS HAVE BEEN
SEQUESTERED ALONE TOGETHER FOR--
SEQUESTERED?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.125
FOR THREE WEEKS.
ST. MARY'S IS OUR MOTHER HOUSE.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.834
WE SPEND MOST OF THE YEAR
ON MISSIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.834
SO THIS IS THE ONE TIME OF YEAR
WE GET TO SEE EACH OTHER.

09:51.875 --> 09:54.834
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN OUTSIDE THESE WALLS

09:54.875 --> 09:56.834
IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
WOW.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.041
ALL RIGHT. SO, PLEASE.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.875
OKAY.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.875
SISTER VIRGINIA
WILL MEET YOU INSIDE.

10:01.917 --> 10:04.250
FATHER MARK?
NO, I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO ENTER.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.250
NO ONE FROM OUTSIDE
THE SISTERHOOD,

10:06.291 --> 10:08.625
BUT THEY NEED YOU.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.041
YOU'RE GOOD CATHOLICS,
YOU'RE DOCTORS.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.834
WELL, DOCTORS AT LEAST.

10:11.875 --> 10:14.667
GO ON. I'LL--I'LL WAIT
FOR YOU HERE.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.458
(groans)

10:19.500 --> 10:22.125
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
SISTER HELEN. SHE'S A DOCTOR.

10:22.166 --> 10:25.041
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
(Sam) WHEN DID SHE START
FEELING BAD?

10:25.083 --> 10:26.500
A WEEK OR SO AGO.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.458
SHE SAID SHE FELT LIKE
SHE WAS GETTING THE FLU.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.458
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE OF US

10:31.500 --> 10:33.458
WHO DOESN'T COMPLAIN
OF ACHES AND PAINS,

10:33.500 --> 10:36.000
SO WE NOTICED.
SAM?

10:38.417 --> 10:41.125
WHAT'S THIS?

10:43.500 --> 10:45.500
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
THE FLU.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.667
STILL DON'T WANT TO TALK,
COOPER.

11:00.709 --> 11:02.041
BUT I WANT TO TALK.

11:02.083 --> 11:05.041
WELL, THERE'S A WORLD WIDE WEB
OUT THERE WAITING FOR YOU.

11:05.083 --> 11:07.375
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND
SOMEONE WHO WILL LISTEN.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.000
I CAN JUST GRAB
THE PEANUT BUTTER AND...

11:12.959 --> 11:15.750
MEN. THEY'RE OVERRATED.

11:15.792 --> 11:19.291
DATING IS OVERRATED.
SEX IS--

11:19.333 --> 11:20.542
DON'T.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.542
DON'T SAY SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET.

11:22.583 --> 11:24.125
(cell phone rings)

11:24.166 --> 11:25.125
(ring)

11:25.166 --> 11:26.125
OH.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.125
(beep)

11:27.166 --> 11:29.083
HELLO, ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.041
CARL.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.667
HI.

11:32.709 --> 11:35.375
YES, I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE COFFEE.

11:35.417 --> 11:39.625
BUT I AM ON CALL
FOR WORK TODAY, SO...

11:39.667 --> 11:41.375
YOU SURE?

11:41.417 --> 11:43.041
OKAY, THEN.

11:43.083 --> 11:46.125
UH, YES, I WILL...
SEE YOU LATER.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.875
B-BYE.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.041
I HAVE A DATE TONIGHT.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.834
YOU DON'T...

11:51.875 --> 11:54.041
YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE
TOO FAST, ADDISON,

11:54.083 --> 11:56.041
NOT WITH A GUY
YOU BARELY KNOW.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.667
UNHAND ME, WOMAN.

11:58.709 --> 12:01.041
I'M GETTING MY DATE ON.

12:03.083 --> 12:05.041
(Naomi) IT WOULD HELP
IF WE COULD

12:05.083 --> 12:07.083
PRECISELY IDENTIFY
THE RASH.
YEAH.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.458
I DON'T HAVE
MY DERM ATLAS ON ME.
WAIT.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.458
SISTER VIRGINIA,
COULD YOU, UM...

12:11.500 --> 12:13.041
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

12:13.083 --> 12:14.458
THANK YOU.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.709
SISTER.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.041
OKAY.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.625
HERE WE GO.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.834
(camera shutter clicks)
I'M GONNA SEND IT TO DELL.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.041
SEE IF HE CAN'T FIND SOMEONE
TO IDENTIFY IT.
OKAY.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.041
(Father Mark)
HOW IS SHE FEELING?

12:27.083 --> 12:29.500
WELL, WE MAY NEED TO GET
SISTER HELEN TO A HOSPITAL.

12:29.542 --> 12:31.542
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO KEEP HER HERE.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.083
BUT WE CAN'T TREAT HER

12:33.125 --> 12:35.083
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT KIND
OF AN INFECTION SHE HAS.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.041
YEAH, AND WE'RE
ALSO GONNA NEED

12:37.083 --> 12:39.417
TO CHECK THE OTHER SISTER
TO SEE IF IT'S CONTAGIOUS.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.417
YOU EVER SEEN A RASH
LIKE THIS?

12:41.458 --> 12:43.041
CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.041
I'M TRACKING DOWN
AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST

12:45.083 --> 12:47.125
TO SEE IF WE CAN GET
AN ANSWER.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.125
UM, I'M DONE WITH MY PATIENTS
FOR THE DAY,

12:49.166 --> 12:50.625
BUT I'LL BE BACK LATER.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.625
UH, RING ME IF WE GET
A SAFE SURRENDER CALL.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.875
I'LL BE JUST DOWN THE STREET.
I'VE GOT A THING.
A THING?

12:55.917 --> 12:57.083
YES.
WELL, DON'T DRINK.

12:57.125 --> 13:00.792
FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS
DRINK AND SAVE BABIES.

13:00.834 --> 13:03.041
(door opens)

13:03.083 --> 13:05.291
I THINK ADDISON HAS
A DATE TONIGHT.

13:05.333 --> 13:08.000
WELL, GOOD FOR HER.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.000
SHE'S GETTING
BACK ON THE HORSE.

13:10.041 --> 13:13.041
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE
A DATE TONIGHT.
REALLY?

13:13.083 --> 13:16.250
YEAH,
WITH Can_Uhandle_Me441.
OH.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.250
WHAT? I DON'T BELIEVE
IN DWELLING.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.291
I BELIEVE IN GETTING BACK
ON THE HORSE.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.041
WELL, I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

13:22.083 --> 13:24.041
HE'S A LUCKY GUY.
WHO IS?

13:24.083 --> 13:26.542
ADDISON'S HORSE.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.500
(woman coughs)

13:29.542 --> 13:31.500
YOU--YOU FEEL
A LITTLE CLAMMY.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.041
I'M FINE.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.041
I SPEND MOST OF THE YEAR
MINISTERING TO PEOPLE IN UGANDA.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.041
YOU OUGHT TO SEE WHAT I'M
EXPOSED TO THERE. (coughs)

13:39.083 --> 13:41.000
I'LL WEATHER
SISTER HELEN'S COLD.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.750
SISTER VIRGINIA,
PLEASE.
YEAH.

13:42.792 --> 13:44.375
(sighs)

13:46.041 --> 13:48.000
(Sam) SO SISTER HELEN'S
TEMPERATURE IS 103,

13:48.041 --> 13:51.208
HER RESPS 26.
YEAH, AND NOW
SISTER VIRGINIA'S GETTING SICK.

13:51.250 --> 13:54.417
AND DELL STILL HASN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING ON THAT RASH.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.041
ALL RIGHT, I THINK

13:56.083 --> 13:58.041
WE SHOULD JUST GET
SISTER HELEN TO A HOSPITAL.

13:58.083 --> 14:01.041
I'LL CALL THE AMBULANCE.
I ALREADY DID.
UH, THEY'RE 20 MINUTES OUT.

14:01.083 --> 14:03.709
OKAY.
WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.959
YEAH, WE DO.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.125
(chuckles)

14:09.083 --> 14:11.041
AND THEN I MOVED TO L.A.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.417
AND LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

14:12.458 --> 14:14.041
(laughs) YES.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.333
THE LIFE OF ADDISON MONTGOMERY
IN TEN MINUTES OR LESS.

14:16.375 --> 14:18.417
WELL,
YOU CAN HAVE 11 MINUTES.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.417
DON'T NEED IT.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.417
HERE GOES.
UH, NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.166
NEVER HAD KIDS.

14:24.208 --> 14:27.208
WANT TO GET MARRIED.
WANT TO HAVE KIDS.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.750
A MAN WITHOUT BAGGAGE--

14:29.792 --> 14:31.166
THAT IS RARE.

14:31.208 --> 14:35.583
WELL, I... HAVE
A LITTLE BAGGAGE TO CONFESS.

14:35.625 --> 14:39.166
I'M, UH, A PATIENT
OF DR. TURNER'S.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.166
I'VE BEEN SEEING HER
ALMOST A YEAR,

14:41.208 --> 14:43.208
AND I CAN SAY,
WITHOUT A DOUBT,

14:43.250 --> 14:46.041
THAT SHE'S MADE ME
A BETTER MAN.

14:46.083 --> 14:48.000
OKAY.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.041
OKAY.

14:51.083 --> 14:54.875
IT'S, UM, IT'S REFRESHING
TO MEET SOMEONE

14:54.917 --> 14:58.041
WHO'S... INTERESTED
IN BEING A BETTER MAN.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.625
REALLY?

14:59.667 --> 15:01.166
YES, REALLY.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.625
(cell phone ringing)

15:02.667 --> 15:06.166
OH, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
EXCUSE ME.

15:06.208 --> 15:07.417
HELLO.

15:07.458 --> 15:08.875
HER NAME IS DARCY.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.667
SHE SAID TO WAIT,

15:10.709 --> 15:13.417
SHE'D MEET US.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.041
DARCY?

15:24.083 --> 15:26.417
IT'S A GIRL.
(sniffles)

15:26.458 --> 15:29.667
SHE'S NOT...
SHE ISN'T CRYING.

15:29.709 --> 15:31.458
I CAN TAKE A LOOK AT HER.
(Addison) ARE YOU BLEEDING?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.500
DARCY, WHY DON'T YOU LET US
TAKE YOU BACK TO THE CLINIC?

15:33.542 --> 15:35.500
NO, YOU JUST HAVE TO
TAKE IT AND GO.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.125
MY MOM'S UPSTAIRS SLEEPING.

15:37.166 --> 15:40.542
YOUR MOTHER WAS HERE
IN THE HOUSE WHEN YOU WERE--

15:40.583 --> 15:44.291
I CRAWLED ON THE TOP BUNK
AND PLAYED MY STEREO REALLY LOUD

15:44.333 --> 15:46.625
TO COVER THE CONTRACTIONS.
YOU CUT THE CORD...

15:46.667 --> 15:49.333
I CLIPPED IT.
SEE? WITH A BARRETTE.

15:49.375 --> 15:51.333
YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION
BY CALLING.

15:51.375 --> 15:54.041
DARCY, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME
JUST FIVE MINUTES, ALL RIGHT?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.959
I'LL DO AN EXAM VERY QUICKLY,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.959
MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T ANY
PROBLEMS, AND THEN YOU CAN GO.
(woman) DARCY.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.291
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO HAVE FRIENDS OVER.

16:01.333 --> 16:03.000
SORRY, MOM.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.250
(whispers)
YOU HAVE TO GO, NOW.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.500
TAKE MY CARD AND A BRACELET.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.500
YOUR DAUGHTER HAS
A MATCHING ONE.

16:09.542 --> 16:11.500
I--JUST GO.
IN CASE
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.291
I WON'T.

16:15.417 --> 16:17.041
(coughs)

16:17.083 --> 16:18.041
HEY.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.333
SAM.

16:19.375 --> 16:20.792
THE AMBULANCE IS HERE.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.750
SAM. MAY I SHOW HIM,
PLEASE?

16:22.792 --> 16:26.291
I FELT FINE. (moans)

16:26.333 --> 16:27.792
OH.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.750
(moans)

16:29.792 --> 16:32.500
NAOMI.
YEAH, I KNOW. I SEE IT.

16:32.542 --> 16:34.500
THIS IS NOT JUST SISTER HELEN
AND SISTER VIRGINIA.

16:34.542 --> 16:37.208
SAM--
HEY, NO, NO. DON'T COME IN.
DON'T COME IN.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.208
THIS BUILDING IS A HOT ZONE.
WE HAVE TO LOCK IT DOWN.
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT THIS IS,

16:40.250 --> 16:42.375
NOBODY COMES IN,
NOBODY GOES OUT.
I AM NOT LEAVING THEM.

16:42.417 --> 16:45.041
OKAY, SHUT THE DOOR THEN.
SHUT THE DOOR.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.500
(coughing)

16:53.542 --> 16:55.500
ST. AMBROSE
SPOKE TO THE C.D.C.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.542
THEY SAID WE WERE RIGHT
TO LOCK DOWN

16:57.583 --> 17:00.667
UNTIL THE HOSPITALS CAN PREP
SOME ISOLATION UNITS FOR THEM.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.125
OR... US.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.583
WHAT DO THEY THINK
THIS IS?

17:04.625 --> 17:06.458
UH, PROBABLY
A VIRAL CONTAGION.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.458
CONSIDERING WHERE
THESE NUNS HAVE BEEN...

17:08.500 --> 17:10.375
DELL FORWARDED THE PICTURES

17:10.417 --> 17:12.375
ON TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE
SPECIALIST,

17:12.417 --> 17:15.041
SO WE'LL KNOW AS--AS SOON
AS HE HEARS BACK.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.375
ALL RIGHT.

17:16.417 --> 17:19.041
HOW LONG UNTIL
THE ISO UNIT'S PREPPED?
SIX HOURS.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.834
THREE MORE SISTERS
HAVE A FEVER.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.041
SO THAT MAKES 8 OF THE 12,

17:24.083 --> 17:26.291
AND... I'M NOT FEELING
TOO GOOD.

17:30.083 --> 17:33.917
STILL DON'T THINK GOD'S
TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING?

17:33.959 --> 17:35.917
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
WE'RE BEING PUNISHED

17:35.959 --> 17:37.917
FOR WHAT WE DID LAST NIGHT?

17:37.959 --> 17:41.041
(chuckles) WHAT,
JUST BECAUSE WE MAY HAVE

17:41.083 --> 17:44.166
SOME RARE, TROPICAL
PROBABLY DEADLY DISEASE?

17:44.208 --> 17:46.750
THE MORNING
AFTER WE HAVE SEX?

17:50.083 --> 17:51.834
WELL, IF WE ARE SICK...

17:53.250 --> 17:55.834
I'M GLAD WE GOT SOME.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.166
(scoffs) HOW SENTIMENTAL.

17:58.208 --> 18:01.041
THAT WAS A JOKE.
I WAS JOKING.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.417
I MEAN, I GOTTA SAY,

18:02.458 --> 18:05.709
THAT KID DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB
OF GIVING BIRTH IN A BUNK BED.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.083
I DID A PRIMARY CHECK,
AND SHE'S FINE FOR NOW.

18:08.125 --> 18:09.709
HER LUNGS ARE GOOD,
HEARTBEAT'S STRONG.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.041
WE'LL GET COOPER TO DO
A WELL-BABY CHECK TOMORROW.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.917
OR YOU CAN CALL HIM NOW.

18:14.959 --> 18:18.125
COOPER'S, UH...
OUT ON A DATE.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.291
OH, GOD.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.208
HE'S DOING HIS...

18:22.250 --> 18:24.250
GET BACK UP
ON THE HORSE THING.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.250
ADDISON IS, TOO, RIGHT?

18:26.291 --> 18:30.125
YOU--YOU HAD YOUR DATE?
HOW DID IT GO?

18:30.166 --> 18:33.208
IT'S OKAY, VIOLET.
I KNOW CARL'S YOUR PATIENT.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.041
HE TOLD ME.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.125
OH, GOOD.

28:41.083 --> 28:44.000
INTO SOME FOSTER HOME
IS KILLING ME.

28:44.041 --> 28:47.208
YOU CAN'T HAVE THIS BABY,
ADDISON.

28:47.250 --> 28:51.583
I KNOW.

28:51.625 --> 28:54.875
I NAMED HER.

28:54.917 --> 28:56.083
BATGIRL.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.583
OKAY. (laughing)

28:57.625 --> 28:59.583
YOU JUST CAN'T HAVE KIDS.

28:59.625 --> 29:00.875
(laughs)

29:00.917 --> 29:04.458
Oh, Nai,
I wish you were here.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.500
IT'S BEEN SUCH A WEIRD DAY.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.667
Oh, tell me about it.

29:08.709 --> 29:10.041
I'M INTERROGATING NUNS.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.542
(sighs) I wish
I were there, too.

29:13.583 --> 29:15.083
(pager beeps)

29:15.125 --> 29:16.917
DAMN IT. I GOTTA GO.

29:16.959 --> 29:17.917
BYE.

29:17.959 --> 29:20.041
(knock on door)

29:20.083 --> 29:21.834
COME IN.

29:21.875 --> 29:25.041
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU
IN HERE.
SHH.

29:25.083 --> 29:28.041
(whispers) BATGIRL CAN
ONLY SLEEP IN TOTAL DARKNESS.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.125
O-OKAY.

29:30.166 --> 29:33.125
UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU?

29:33.166 --> 29:36.834
UH... IT'S CARL.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.417
CARL LIKES YOU VERY MUCH,

29:38.458 --> 29:40.458
BUT HE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU

29:40.500 --> 29:43.041
THAT HE--HE'S NOT
GONNA BE CALLING AGAIN.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.125
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:45.166 --> 29:49.166
HE HAS A MEDICAL ISSUE
THAT WORSENS UNDER STRESS.
WHAT TYPE OF ISSUE?

29:49.208 --> 29:51.458
IT--IT DOESN'T MATTER.
WHY DO YOU CALL HIM "TRUNK"?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.542
OH, YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.959
OKAY, UH, WELL,
THAT WAS VERY...

29:56.000 --> 29:57.959
(clears throat)
UNPROFESSIONAL OF ME

29:58.000 --> 30:00.792
TO SAY THAT.

30:00.834 --> 30:05.083
UH, A TRUNK IS A PLACE
WHERE YOU

30:05.125 --> 30:07.792
MIGHT PUT
ALL SORTS OF THINGS,

30:07.834 --> 30:11.041
THINGS YOU MIGHT HAVE,
UH, TAKEN,

30:11.083 --> 30:14.709
OR BORROWED
FROM ANOTHER PERSON...

30:14.750 --> 30:17.041
IN AN ANATOMICAL SENSE.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.208
OH, GOD.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.333
(gasps)

30:22.083 --> 30:23.583
WHERE IS MY SHOE?

30:23.625 --> 30:25.583
WE--WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.

30:25.625 --> 30:27.709
IT IS NOTHING
TO BE DISTURBED BY.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.208
IT--IT'S AN ISSUE
OF CONTROL.
AH-AH.

30:30.250 --> 30:32.208
I AM GOING TO GET UP,

30:32.250 --> 30:34.208
AND I'M GONNA
WALK OUT OF THIS ROOM,

30:34.250 --> 30:38.041
AND YOU AND I ARE NEVER, EVER,
GOING TO SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN.

30:38.083 --> 30:40.041
I WOULD LIKE THAT
VERY MUCH.

30:45.041 --> 30:47.041
NO CHANGE?
(Sam) NO.

30:47.083 --> 30:50.750
I'M SORRY.
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU,

30:50.792 --> 30:55.041
I'D LIKE TO GIVE HER
THE SACRAMENT OF THE SICK.
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.250
"THE GRACED PEACE OF GOD
OUR FATHER

31:04.291 --> 31:07.041
AND THE LORD JESUS CHRIST
BE WITH YOU."

31:09.625 --> 31:11.458
"THROUGH THIS HOLY ANOINTING,
MAY THE LORD,

31:11.500 --> 31:14.250
"IN HIS LOVE AND MERCY,
HELP YOU

31:14.291 --> 31:16.250
"WITH THE GRACE
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.041
MAY THE LORD..."

31:18.083 --> 31:20.083
THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER--
I KNOW.

31:20.125 --> 31:23.083
"SAVE YOU
AND RAISE YOU UP."

31:23.125 --> 31:25.000
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.375
(knock on door)

31:30.417 --> 31:32.291
DON'T BE MAD,

31:32.333 --> 31:35.834
BUT I CALLED
SOCIAL SERVICES.

31:35.875 --> 31:39.709
I MEANT TO CALL.
I JUST... FORGOT.

31:39.750 --> 31:42.000
THAT'S... GOOD.

31:42.041 --> 31:44.000
I CAN HELP YOU
PACK UP HER STUFF.

31:44.041 --> 31:47.041
THANKS. UH...
COME ON, BABY.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.917
HOW LONG
TILL THEY GET HERE?

31:49.959 --> 31:51.166
SHH. SHH.
(baby whines)

31:51.208 --> 31:53.208
THERE YOU GO.
OH, BATGIRL.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.208
(cries)

31:54.250 --> 31:55.959
OKAY.
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.208
(cell phone ringing)

31:57.250 --> 31:58.959
OH.
(cries)

31:59.000 --> 32:01.917
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN, OKAY?

32:01.959 --> 32:03.875
SAFE SURRENDER HOTLINE.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.208
(Pete) DID SHE SAY WHERE,
EXACTLY?

32:07.250 --> 32:10.458
NO, SHE JUST SAID MARINE PARK
PAST THE FIRST PARKING LOT.

32:12.792 --> 32:14.083
ADDISON.

32:20.667 --> 32:22.542
THE BABY'S NOT BREATHING.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.542
THERE'S NO PULSE.

32:24.583 --> 32:26.583
LET'S CONTINUE
TO BRING UP HIS TEMP

32:26.625 --> 32:28.125
WITH WARMED OXYGEN
AND FLUIDS.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.458
MORE SALINE BAGS.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.125
WHAT'S HIS CORE TEMP?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.792
CORE TEMP IS 95.

32:33.834 --> 32:35.792
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

32:35.834 --> 32:37.750
UH, LET'S DO
ANOTHER ROUND OF EPI.

32:37.792 --> 32:39.750
COME ON, LITTLE GUY.
COME ON, BABY.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.166
DON'T DO THIS.

32:42.208 --> 32:45.041
(tone continues)

32:45.083 --> 32:46.166
ASYSTOLE.

32:46.208 --> 32:48.917
ADDISON, YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR.

32:48.959 --> 32:51.959
(tone continues)

32:57.959 --> 33:00.917
(tone continues)

33:03.417 --> 33:06.417
OKAY.

33:06.458 --> 33:09.208
I'M GONNA CALL IT.

33:09.250 --> 33:12.375
TIME OF DEATH--10:42 P.M.

33:17.166 --> 33:19.125
WE GOT THERE
AS SOON AS WE COULD.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.125
IT'S OVER.
WE TRIED.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.125
IT'S OVER, PETE.
ADDISON,
WE DID EVERYTHING WE--

33:23.166 --> 33:25.125
IT'S OVER.
THE BABY'S DEAD.

33:32.166 --> 33:33.875
TOUGH DAY.

33:33.917 --> 33:35.125
(sighs)

33:35.166 --> 33:37.750
YEAH.

33:37.792 --> 33:40.041
I USED TO GET OFF ON 'EM,

33:40.083 --> 33:42.583
THE TOUGH ONES.

33:42.625 --> 33:45.041
WHEN I WAS A RESIDENT,
I USED TO THINK,

33:45.083 --> 33:47.583
I GOT THROUGH THIS,
I SURVIVED.

33:47.625 --> 33:51.375
AND THE NEXT ONE,
I'LL SURVIVE EVEN BETTER.

33:51.417 --> 33:53.959
I DON'T.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.041
IT'S DAYS LIKE THESE
WHERE I SLIP

33:56.083 --> 33:59.792
AND MAKE MISTAKES.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.083
BAD MISTAKES.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.667
THESE LONG...

34:04.709 --> 34:07.417
CRAPPY DAYS JUST...

34:09.625 --> 34:12.625
I JUST NEED SOMETHING,

34:12.667 --> 34:15.041
SOMEONE, AND I END UP--

34:15.083 --> 34:17.417
FALLING OFF YOUR WAGON.

34:19.542 --> 34:23.750
WHOEVER YOUR WAGON MAY BE.
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE PRACTICE.

34:27.458 --> 34:30.542
THIS IS THE LAST TIME
I'M OFFERING TO TALK.

34:32.625 --> 34:35.917
COOPER, IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

34:35.959 --> 34:37.667
I-I CAN'T.

34:37.709 --> 34:40.750
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
I KNOW.

34:40.792 --> 34:42.959
BUT?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.083
ALLAN OBLITERATES MY HEART,

34:45.125 --> 34:49.041
AND YOU TELL ME THAT
HE DOESN'T DESERVE ME.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.917
SOME GIRL NAMED TRIXIE

34:51.959 --> 34:53.458
USES AND ABUSES YOU,

34:53.500 --> 34:55.291
AND I LISTEN TO YOU

34:55.333 --> 34:57.291
AND I TELL YOU
YOU'RE BEING STUPID.

34:57.333 --> 35:01.041
I-I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.959
BUT I CAN'T... I CAN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOU.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.750
I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TALK ABOUT US.

35:06.792 --> 35:09.000
NOT LIKE THAT.

35:11.083 --> 35:13.041
THEN TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

35:13.083 --> 35:15.375
WHATEVER'S ON YOUR MIND.

35:20.709 --> 35:23.000
I WENT TO THE E.R.

35:24.625 --> 35:29.792
CARL... SHOVED ONE OF
ADDISON'S SHOES UP HIS--

35:29.834 --> 35:32.041
YEAH, OKAY, OKAY.
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU ASKED.

35:32.083 --> 35:34.583
THAT'S WHAT WAS ON MY MIND.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.250
(sighs)

35:36.291 --> 35:39.875
MAYBE CARL WILL FIND A GIRL
WHO ENJOYS WHAT HE DOES.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.125
SO--SO THAT--

35:41.166 --> 35:43.875
THAT'S THE ANSWER?
MY JOB HAS NO POINT?

35:43.917 --> 35:47.917
FREAKS SHOULD JUST BE
WITH OTHER FREAKS?
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT US?

35:47.959 --> 35:49.834
ABOUT ME?

35:49.875 --> 35:51.834
NO. I...

35:51.875 --> 35:54.000
NO.

35:57.458 --> 36:00.709
UH, SISTER VIRGINIA'S
DOING BETTER.

36:00.750 --> 36:02.041
SHE, UH...

36:02.083 --> 36:04.959
HER PRESSURE HAS NORMALIZED
SINCE LAST TIME.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.500
(clears throat)

36:06.542 --> 36:09.500
FATHER, WE'D LIKE
TO TEST YOU FOR TYPHOID.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.834
ME? I FEEL FINE.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.083
CARRIERS ARE ASYMPTOMATIC.

36:12.125 --> 36:15.041
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW YOU HAD IT
UNTIL IT SPREAD.

36:15.083 --> 36:16.333
WELL, I'VE DONE
MISSIONARY WORK

36:16.375 --> 36:19.000
ALL OVER THE WORLD,
BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

36:19.041 --> 36:20.208
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

36:20.250 --> 36:23.041
THIS DISEASE
CAN STAY DORMANT FOR YEARS.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.250
YOU THINK...

36:25.291 --> 36:27.875
YOU THINK SISTER VIRGINIA
GOT IT FROM ME?

36:27.917 --> 36:30.875
I KNOW YOU SAY YOU DON'TGO
IN THE CONVENT, BUT...

36:30.917 --> 36:34.000
IF YOU HAD
DIRECT CONTACT WITH HER...

36:41.709 --> 36:45.041
I WOULD SNEAK IN
AT NIGHT, AND WE--

36:45.083 --> 36:47.750
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY.

36:47.792 --> 36:50.041
I WOULD SNEAK IN,
AND WE WOULD...

36:50.083 --> 36:52.041
COOK.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.375
COOK?

36:53.417 --> 36:56.667
I COULDN'T BOIL WATER
BEFORE SHE ARRIVED.

36:56.709 --> 36:58.583
NEVER HAD TO.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.667
BUT THEN I WOULD SEE HER,

37:00.709 --> 37:03.917
AND SHE WAS JUST
SO GRACEFUL AND SMART.

37:03.959 --> 37:06.250
WHEN NO ONE ELSE
WAS AROUND,

37:06.291 --> 37:09.041
I WOULD ASK HER
FOR POINTERS.

37:09.083 --> 37:10.583
IT'S BEEN YEARS NOW.

37:10.625 --> 37:13.000
AND WE HAVE NEVER TOUCHED.

37:13.041 --> 37:15.125
I KNOW IT WAS FORBIDDEN.

37:17.083 --> 37:21.375
SHE'D BE AWAY ON MISSIONS,
AND I'D JUST...

37:21.417 --> 37:26.041
PART OF ME
WAS ALWAYS WAITING.

37:26.083 --> 37:29.083
FOR THE NEXT TIME
YOU COULD BE TOGETHER.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.875
I MISSED MY FRIEND.

37:33.917 --> 37:35.125
UH...

37:35.166 --> 37:38.041
ALL THIS PAIN
BECAUSE OF ME, I JUST--

37:38.083 --> 37:40.041
OH, NO, NO.
YOU--YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.667
WE'LL GET YOU ON A COURSE
OF ANTIBIOTICS,

37:42.709 --> 37:44.667
YOU'LL BE FINE.
YEAH.

37:44.709 --> 37:46.000
THANK YOU.

37:47.959 --> 37:50.709
SAM, NAOMI, UH...

37:50.750 --> 37:52.667
WE ALL MAKE CHOICES.

37:52.709 --> 37:55.041
THE TWO OF YOU
MADE A CHOICE.

37:55.083 --> 37:57.750
I KNOW. I WAS THERE.
AND SO WAS HE.

37:57.792 --> 38:01.041
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT AS FAR AS,

38:01.083 --> 38:04.000
UH, WE'RE CONCERNED...

38:04.041 --> 38:07.083
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MARRIED.

38:15.083 --> 38:17.000
(elevator bell dings)

38:17.041 --> 38:19.333
DARCY, ARE YOU OKAY?

38:19.375 --> 38:22.542
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR WHO--
YOU TOOK THE BABY?

38:22.583 --> 38:25.750
MA'AM, WE WERE OFFERING
YOUR DAUGHTER A SAFE OPTION.
IT'S CALLED SAFE SURRENDER.

38:25.792 --> 38:28.041
SHE'S ACTUALLY PROTECTING
HERSELF AND THE BABY.

38:28.083 --> 38:31.041
SHE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE TO
CALL. IT WAS THE BRAVE CHOICE.

38:31.083 --> 38:34.041
YOU THINK WE'D EVER LET HER
GIVE THIS BABY AWAY?

38:34.083 --> 38:36.041
MY GOD.
THIS IS MY GRANDCHILD.

38:36.083 --> 38:39.333
(sobs)
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.000
OH.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.208
I-IS SHE OKAY?

38:45.250 --> 38:47.625
SHE'S A VERY HEALTHY BABY.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.834
HERE YOU GO. OKAY?

38:49.875 --> 38:52.041
GOT HER?

38:52.083 --> 38:53.333
YEAH.
OKAY.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.041
(baby coos)
HI.

38:55.083 --> 38:58.041
HI.

38:58.083 --> 39:00.000
HER NAME IS MELANIE.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.625
MY DAUGHTER'S NAME
IS MELANIE.

39:09.083 --> 39:12.417
THAT'S A PERFECT NAME.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.250
FATHER MARK SAID

39:21.291 --> 39:23.250
WE'RE STILL MARRIED
IN THE EYES OF GOD,

39:23.291 --> 39:26.959
SO TECHNICALLY,
WHAT WE DID THE OTHER NIGHT,

39:27.000 --> 39:28.333
NOT A SIN.

39:28.375 --> 39:30.041
OH, REALLY?

39:30.083 --> 39:32.041
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THE FATHER SAID.

39:32.083 --> 39:36.166
WHICH MEANS IF WE WERE
TO DO IT AGAIN...

39:38.083 --> 39:41.000
(laughs)

39:53.667 --> 39:55.041
CHARLOTTE.

39:55.083 --> 39:57.208
I'M GOING HOME,
DR. FREEDMAN.

39:57.250 --> 40:00.041
COME HAVE A DRINK WITH ME.

40:00.083 --> 40:03.291
WHAT? NO.

40:03.333 --> 40:05.583
COME ON.

40:05.625 --> 40:07.583
I AM NOT HAVING SEX WITH YOU

40:07.625 --> 40:09.583
JUST BECAUSE I WROTE
SOME THINGS ON THE INTERNET.

40:09.625 --> 40:11.125
NO.

40:11.166 --> 40:12.959
A DRINK.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
NOT SEX.
ABSOLUTELY NO SEX.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
(panting)

40:28.083 --> 40:29.500
(sighs)

40:29.542 --> 40:31.500
I COULD GET YOU
