00:30.948 --> 00:32.573
All right, the Big Picture.

00:32.658 --> 00:35.410
So, this is my favorite thing
in the whole place.

00:36.578 --> 00:41.667
If you actually go to the observatory,
they have this photo printed, huge,

00:41.750 --> 00:45.546
on this massive wall
that's bigger than our auditorium.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.840
-Mandy.
-So, this is the whole universe?

00:48.715 --> 00:52.261
That's a great question. See, that's--
No. That's the crazy thing.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.805
This is just a really small slice
of the universe.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.974
So, if you hold up your finger…

00:57.057 --> 00:58.976
Hold 'em up. Yeah. Good.

00:59.685 --> 01:05.022
If you went out at night and you held
your finger up to the sky like this,

01:05.107 --> 01:09.570
you'd probably only be covering up,
like, one or two stars, right?

01:09.653 --> 01:13.866
But if you had a telescope,
you would see all of this.

01:13.949 --> 01:17.327
All of these stars and galaxies,
and everything in this photo,

01:17.411 --> 01:20.706
it's just one finger's worth
of the universe.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.751
And that's all the time we have.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.045
Sorry. One more thing before we go.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.840
I do have to ask a question for
the end-of-year survey I've been doing.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.427
So, can you raise your hand
if you'd like to do more astronomy?

01:34.595 --> 01:37.264
One, two, three, four. Nice.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.099
And raise your hand if not.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.518
Ramon. Really? Why not?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.228
I don't know.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.106
I guess it just makes me feel small.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.028
I get it.

01:53.405 --> 01:58.869
I guess now's also probably a good moment
to ask just how everyone's feeling.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.413
You know, being stuck at home
and everything.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.958
Anyone wanna share
anything they're feeling?

02:08.503 --> 02:10.172
Okay, cool.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.931
So, where'd this girl come from?

02:19.473 --> 02:22.059
Tinder, or… What's the other one? Bumble?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.728
Oh, shit. Was it Jdate?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.355
-Was it actually Jdate?
-No.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.316
Her mom works with my mom.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.110
-Oh, my God. Wow.
-I know. It's really awful.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.404
I didn't want to do it,
but my mom really wanted me to.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.697
So I was like, "Okay."

02:35.781 --> 02:38.742
But then lockdown happened,
so I thought I got out of it,

02:38.825 --> 02:41.912
but then she brought it up again,
and so now I have to do it on Zoom.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.958
-Is it boring?
-No.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.168
'Cause I would be ecstatic
to not talk about this.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.838
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little tired.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.131
-You look tired.
-Fuck you. I don't look tired.

02:53.215 --> 02:56.760
-No. I'm saying, are you okay?
-Nah, I've just been having bad dreams.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.595
Uh-huh.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.598
What happens in the dreams?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.894
Just a lot of people with no masks on.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.145
-Really?
-For real. Yeah.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.773
-That is so weird.
-How's that weird? It's pretty…

03:09.857 --> 03:11.692
'Cause my dreams don't make
that much sense.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.068
I have those too. But these--

03:13.151 --> 03:15.153
-These are fucking scary, man.
-Yeah.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.448
I'm running and running,
trying to get away from them.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.910
Like, "Get the fuck up off me. Why aren't
you wearing a fucking mask?" Right?

03:21.994 --> 03:25.539
But wherever I go, there's somebody else
there with no mask on, right?

03:25.622 --> 03:26.623
Yeah.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.168
And then I don't wanna fall back asleep,

03:29.251 --> 03:30.711
'cause I'll just see them.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.550
Yeah.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.595
This guy at work got it.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.766
He got it at work?

03:44.850 --> 03:47.269
No. A family party, I think.

03:47.352 --> 03:50.606
-He won't admit it, but I'm pretty sure.
-Jesus Christ.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.650
Is he okay?

03:55.110 --> 03:56.195
I don't know, man.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.238
I haven't heard from him.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.534
You okay?

04:04.203 --> 04:06.205
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

04:06.914 --> 04:07.956
I'm good.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.065
Do you play music?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.070
Are you asking 'cause-- You s-- The--

04:38.153 --> 04:39.738
-You saw the guitar.
-Yeah.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.864
Sorry.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.078
That's really embarrassing.
I was actually gonna move that.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.121
I opened up the Zoom

04:48.205 --> 04:50.457
and I saw it back there, and I was like--

04:52.167 --> 04:54.795
I don't wanna come off as that guy
that's like, "Look at me, I'm a musician

04:54.878 --> 04:56.922
'cause I have a guitar
in the back of my Zoom."

04:57.005 --> 04:58.215
Like-- I-- Yeah.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.342
I just thought if I moved it now,
that'd be weird.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.553
It'd, like, draw more attention to it. So…

05:03.178 --> 05:05.597
Yeah.
I didn't think you'd see that. Sorry.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.432
It's okay.
We don't have to talk about your guitar.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.435
-It's fine.
-No, it's fine. I don't-- It-- Yes.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.896
I am a musician. Kinda.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.108
What do you mean, "kind of"?

05:17.693 --> 05:19.027
Good question. What do I mean?

05:19.111 --> 05:21.363
I guess I don't do it professionally?

05:22.573 --> 05:24.700
Well, yeah. Yeah, I know that.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.618
That's a good thing. Don't worry.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.120
Wait. How do you know that?

05:28.203 --> 05:30.205
-You're a teacher, right?
-Yeah.

05:30.289 --> 05:34.793
Yeah. Well, I wouldn't have agreed to go
on a date with an actual musician. So…

05:34.877 --> 05:35.919
An actual musician?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.758
I'm sorry. I meant to say a professional

05:41.842 --> 05:44.887
or, you know, someone in the business.
Industry.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.890
Right. Well, then I'm your guy.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.477
I didn't mean to say
you're not an actual musician.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.813
-Don't worry. It's fine. Don't worry.
-I apologize.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.277
-Are you in a band or…
-You don't have to ask me about it.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.779
-We don't have to talk about it.
-No, I'd really like to know.

06:03.614 --> 06:04.615
Tell me.

06:05.949 --> 06:09.161
Okay. No, I'm not in a band.

06:10.787 --> 06:15.083
But there's a lot you can just do
by yourself, I guess.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.503
With overdubbing and everything.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.588
Okay. What's overdubbing?

06:20.631 --> 06:22.341
That's, like, just when you record,

06:22.424 --> 06:25.385
if you play a bunch of different parts
and put 'em together.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.723
Got it. So you're making an album?

06:29.806 --> 06:30.849
No.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.104
I mean, what's an album anymore, right?

06:36.188 --> 06:37.231
I don't know.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.691
Yeah. I'm making a…

06:40.859 --> 06:43.654
I don't know what I'm making.
I'm making something. It's gonna be great.

06:43.737 --> 06:47.741
It's almost done, actually.
Just needs drums and… Yeah.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.409
-Sounds cool.
-Thanks.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.246
So, when are you gonna do the drums?

06:52.329 --> 06:54.665
Drums are hard. Drums-- It's like--

06:54.748 --> 06:58.710
Recording a real drum set's the only thing
you still can't do in a bedroom, you know?

06:58.794 --> 07:01.171
You can use fake drums,
and that's what everybody does,

07:01.255 --> 07:02.589
but it's not the same.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.674
So…

07:05.050 --> 07:06.552
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.388
Okay.
So, how are you gonna finish your song?

07:13.392 --> 07:14.393
Why?

07:15.894 --> 07:16.979
I--

07:17.855 --> 07:19.273
I just like finishing things.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.278
Look, I don't know anything
about music. So…

07:25.028 --> 07:26.738
Everyone knows something
about music, right?

07:26.822 --> 07:28.198
Not me.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.992
What, you never listen to music?

07:30.075 --> 07:31.493
No, I do. I like music.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.037
I just don't know anything about music.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.832
What's the last song you listened to?

07:36.915 --> 07:38.375
I wouldn't know that.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.336
Okay. What's one song you like right now?

07:42.629 --> 07:43.964
Definitely no idea.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.846
Okay. What's one CD you remember having
when you were a kid?

07:52.681 --> 07:54.391
I didn't own any CDs.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.019
Uh-huh.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.646
They were really expensive.
I remember that.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.731
Very expensive. Sure.

08:00.814 --> 08:04.610
That was all my money.
Like, everything I had, I spent on CDs.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.445
'Cause back then, you know,

08:06.528 --> 08:09.907
that was really the only way
you could listen to music.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.367
Like if you wanted to hear
anything specific.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.745
Otherwise, just the radio.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.915
-I only listen to the radio.
-Oof.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.542
Oof? What's wrong with the radio?

08:23.712 --> 08:25.964
You know what? Nothing.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.551
Okay.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.096
What?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.140
No. I just…

08:38.477 --> 08:40.145
I think you're onto something.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.565
So, where'd you grow up?

08:43.649 --> 08:45.108
I grew up here.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.610
-Yeah? Where?
-LA.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.904
No, I know. Like, where?

08:49.613 --> 08:50.697
The Valley.

08:50.781 --> 08:51.782
Me too.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.325
-Really? Where?
-Van Nuys.

08:54.576 --> 08:57.287
Funny. My parents still live on Ranchito.

08:57.913 --> 08:58.914
Wow.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.126
We must've, like,
played in a park together or something.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.046
We never went to parks.
My mom hated parks.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.090
How do you hate a park?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.342
Well, it's more the playgrounds. You know?

09:10.425 --> 09:14.429
She despises sand, among other things.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.099
-She sounds charming.
-Hey. Be nice.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.309
Okay. Sorry, sorry.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.311
Do you wanna see her?

09:21.895 --> 09:22.980
Yeah.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.148
She introduced us. I should thank her.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.403
Here she is.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.697
-That's your mom and dad?
-Yeah.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.700
-That's really sweet.
-Thanks.

09:34.783 --> 09:38.161
I love it when people aren't smiling
in pictures.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.663
Really? Why is that?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.583
It just feels honest, I guess.

09:42.666 --> 09:46.295
Like, I never feel like smiling
when someone's pointing a camera at me.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.715
Yeah. Well, they don't really smile ever.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.759
-You know? Not just in pictures.
-That can't be true.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.136
Yeah, it kind of is.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.264
What do you mean, "kind of"?

09:59.641 --> 10:02.436
You know, they had a really hard life.
Really different from us.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.606
And where they came from,
at the time, it was really bad.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.817
And, you know, they came here with nothing
and figured it out.

10:09.401 --> 10:11.445
Yeah.
That's kinda like my great-grandparents.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.654
On my mom's side, anyway.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.907
I only have one picture
of my great-grandfather,

10:14.990 --> 10:17.451
and he is not smiling in it at all.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.454
-Where is he from?
-Russia.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.955
Russia.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.124
-Yeah. Where are your parents from?
-Korea.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.377
Bunch of my students are first-generation.

10:27.461 --> 10:31.381
Like, their parents came over, I guess.
Like yours did.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.009
It's… It's a thing.

10:35.052 --> 10:36.220
What do you mean?

10:36.303 --> 10:40.390
No, I mean,
each one of them's different, but--

10:40.474 --> 10:43.810
Yeah, like, there's this one kid,
and she's--

10:43.894 --> 10:46.480
Well, she's from here,
but her parents are from Iran.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.733
And some of the stuff she talks about
and writes about

10:49.816 --> 10:53.487
is so different from anything
I was thinking about when I was ten.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.989
You know? Like she…

10:56.698 --> 10:59.618
Like, she always used to go back there
every summer.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.037
But then a couple of years ago
she had to stop going,

11:02.120 --> 11:05.791
'cause I guess they're, you know,
scared of our government.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.961
And it's an awful thing.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.213
And I feel really bad for her,

11:11.296 --> 11:15.384
but I do think that in a way,
it's making her stronger.

11:15.467 --> 11:21.974
Like, she is so aware
and sharp and passionate.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.393
And she's gonna grow up and kick ass.
I'm telling you.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.688
Like, I would bet on that girl. I'd bet.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.359
-What's her name?
-Nicki.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.153
Nicki.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.409
Are you hungry?

11:42.286 --> 11:43.287
Yeah.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.248
-Sure.
-Me too.

11:47.249 --> 11:50.043
He goes, "It just makes me feel small."

11:50.878 --> 11:53.297
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I just love him.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.050
He's such this heartfelt, thoughtful guy.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.679
Does the universe make you feel small?

12:01.180 --> 12:02.806
Yeah. Doesn't it for you?

12:04.474 --> 12:08.187
Well, that's not the main thing I feel
when I look at that picture.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.647
You know the Big Picture?

12:11.565 --> 12:12.983
Yeah, dude. I grew up here.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.777
-I've been to the Griffith Observatory.
-Yeah. Right, right. Right.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.071
-I love the Big Picture.
-So do I.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.616
But you just said it makes you feel small.

12:20.699 --> 12:21.700
It does.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.785
Right.

12:23.869 --> 12:27.372
Yeah, but for me, it's more like,
"I can't believe I get to be human."

12:28.081 --> 12:32.586
You know? With a body
and a brain and hands and eyes.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.796
And I can see things and do things.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.091
Like, I get to be this crazy,
complicated machine

12:38.175 --> 12:42.846
because, what, out of all the empty space
and specks of dust and gas,

12:42.930 --> 12:46.058
there's this one little rock
where the conditions are just right?

12:46.141 --> 12:47.601
And it has warm water,

12:47.684 --> 12:50.103
so particles in the ocean can
bump into each other

12:50.187 --> 12:53.357
over and over and over again
for, like, billions of years

12:53.440 --> 12:55.692
until they start sticking together
and reproducing.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.029
And that evolved into me?

12:59.112 --> 13:03.951
And now I get to sit here
and eat delicious vegetable curry

13:04.034 --> 13:05.410
and talk to you over Zoom.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.329
I mean, what?

13:08.205 --> 13:10.457
That is the opposite of small.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.460
You know? Everything else is so small.
How did I get to be this big?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.046
Wow.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.924
Yeah. Big is something I never feel.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.470
-But you know what I'm saying.
-Yeah. It's a miracle.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.766
No. It's not a miracle.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.310
That's what's so cool about it.
It really happened.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.979
You know? Miracles are fake.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.106
Not necessarily.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.777
-That is the definition of a miracle.
-No, it's not.

13:39.778 --> 13:42.114
Okay. Define "miracle."

13:45.784 --> 13:46.994
Okay.

13:47.077 --> 13:50.706
A miracle is something you can't explain.

13:51.665 --> 13:54.001
Right. But we can explain this. You know?

13:54.084 --> 13:57.296
It's not some story that somebody made up.
It's science.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.548
-Science is made of stories.
-Careful.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.049
What?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.886
-Don't be anti-science.
-I'm not.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.430
Well, it sounds like you are.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.725
You just said
that science is made up of stories.

14:09.808 --> 14:13.770
But stories is the opposite of science.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.814
Stories is what gets us into
so much trouble.

14:15.898 --> 14:19.651
Okay, wait.
Science, at least how I understand it,

14:19.735 --> 14:24.031
is people trying to figure out
what's really going on, right?

14:24.114 --> 14:28.285
But one of the coolest things
about scientists is they're humble enough

14:28.368 --> 14:35.167
to admit that they can never really know
anything for sure, like 100% absolutely.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.294
So, you know, they do their best.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.880
They look around. They gather evidence.

14:39.963 --> 14:43.550
And they try to make sense of it all
by telling a story.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.469
And that story is called a hypothesis.

14:46.053 --> 14:50.182
And then they test their hypothesis
by gathering more evidence.

14:50.265 --> 14:54.019
And sometimes they're wrong,
and they have to change their story.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.563
Sometimes they're right,
and they get to keep their story

14:56.647 --> 15:00.817
until they find some new evidence
that proves their old story wrong,

15:00.901 --> 15:02.903
and then they have to come up with
a new story.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.200
Is that what you tell your students?

15:09.993 --> 15:11.245
Yes.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.289
Yes, it is. That's kinda my spiel.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.667
I like it.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.751
You do?

15:19.253 --> 15:20.337
Well, thanks.

15:20.420 --> 15:24.132
But you still shouldn't tell them
that science is made up of stories.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.343
They're just gonna think
that it's all made up.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.804
Okay. What should I tell them?

15:33.267 --> 15:35.394
I could say it's made up of true stories.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.062
Okay.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.857
Stories that get more and more true.

15:40.566 --> 15:41.567
Great.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.194
Cool.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.988
That's what I'm gonna tell 'em
from now on.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.782
-Great. That sounds good to me.
-All right. If it's good with you.

15:48.866 --> 15:51.159
It is. It is.

15:51.243 --> 15:52.452
All right.

15:52.536 --> 15:53.537
Really?

15:54.204 --> 15:55.205
Yeah.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.041
It doesn't seem like you.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.628
Well, it's not anymore.
But it definitely was.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.338
Severe depression?

16:05.299 --> 16:06.425
What's the "severe" mean?

16:08.302 --> 16:11.013
It means it was severe.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.309
I wonder if my anxiety is severe.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.352
You have anxiety?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.229
Yeah. I think so.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.276
Well, you would know if it were severe.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.613
It feels pretty bad.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.365
That's not really severe.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.326
No. Like, I had to miss work one day.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.954
I had to miss work for seven weeks.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.792
What?

16:40.876 --> 16:42.836
No, no. No. It-- I just--

16:45.172 --> 16:47.257
I would've thought what I had was severe.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.557
Are we gonna turn off the lights?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.101
Sure.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.694
Now I can't see you.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.696
That's all right.

17:10.781 --> 17:12.991
Remember back
when people used to just talk on the phone

17:13.075 --> 17:14.785
without seeing each other on video?

17:15.285 --> 17:18.622
Oh, yeah. Like way back in February.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.963
I can still hear you breathing.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.009
This is like being 14.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.178
What do you mean?

17:34.513 --> 17:36.557
You know, like with boys back then.

17:36.640 --> 17:40.394
We would just talk on the phone
for hours and hours.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.272
Well, right. Yeah.
Because nobody could drive.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.190
So there's no way
to be together in person.

17:45.274 --> 17:48.068
Yeah. Like, I had this one boyfriend.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.696
I guess you can call him that.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.115
That's what I called him at the time,
"my boyfriend,"

17:53.198 --> 17:55.826
but we, like, never saw each other
in person.

17:56.952 --> 17:58.662
It all happened over the phone.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.164
What all happened?

18:02.791 --> 18:07.004
-Oh, it all happened.
-What?

18:08.672 --> 18:12.551
You know. Just, I would tell him
what I was gonna do to him.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.762
Uh-huh. What would you say?

18:16.430 --> 18:17.514
I'm not telling you.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.808
-Why not?
-Because.

18:19.892 --> 18:20.893
Okay.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.564
Did you ever do the things
you said you were gonna do to him?

18:26.398 --> 18:27.941
-No.
-No?

18:28.942 --> 18:31.195
Yeah, no.
It just wasn't the same in person.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.282
You know? There was just something
about being on the phone.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.536
So maybe it's a good thing
our first date was on a computer.

18:41.246 --> 18:42.331
Maybe.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.671
What do you think would've happened
if we had gone on a real date?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.883
I don't know. I hate dates.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.885
-Me too.
-No. I hate it.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.762
No. Me too.

18:57.930 --> 19:01.683
Like, as soon as I get there,
I always just want it to be over.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.768
Well, yeah.

19:02.851 --> 19:07.022
Because usually, I know within the first,
like, 60 seconds

19:07.105 --> 19:08.524
that it's not going anywhere.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.317
Yeah, exactly.

19:11.777 --> 19:13.403
I do miss going to restaurants.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.072
I don't.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.116
First dates just shouldn't be in public.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.787
-It's too performatory.
-What are you talking about?

19:21.870 --> 19:25.666
First dates should always be in public
in case the guy turns out to be a rapist.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.751
Okay.

19:28.377 --> 19:31.505
But it's not the other people
that bother me so much.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.090
It's just the whole situation.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.467
It feels like a job interview.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.136
You're sitting across the table from them

19:38.220 --> 19:40.764
and you're both, like,
assessing each other,

19:40.848 --> 19:43.725
and it just feels so transactional.

19:45.519 --> 19:48.897
And then, at the end,
you're supposed to maybe kiss.

19:48.981 --> 19:51.400
I mean, who wants to kiss
someone they just met?

19:52.150 --> 19:54.152
We just met. I wanna kiss you.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.075
I wanna kiss you too.

20:01.410 --> 20:02.411
You do?

20:03.078 --> 20:04.496
Yeah. I think so.

20:05.581 --> 20:08.250
But you wouldn't
if we were on a real date?

20:11.795 --> 20:13.088
Probably not, huh?

20:15.340 --> 20:16.341
Good night.

20:17.968 --> 20:18.969
Good night.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.806
Then I would think you didn't like me.

20:22.890 --> 20:28.020
And I wouldn't want to be pushy,
so I wouldn't call you right away.

20:29.813 --> 20:34.193
And then you wouldn't think
I was all that serious

20:34.276 --> 20:35.402
'cause I didn't call.

20:35.485 --> 20:41.325
So then you wouldn't call me, and then
we'd both just move on with our lives.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.167
Are you sleeping?

21:51.019 --> 21:52.229
Anyway. It's a lot.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.772
Which is why I should probably go

21:53.856 --> 21:57.067
'cause I have to put all of that together
in a presentation by end of day.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.528
Wow. That was a lot.

22:00.279 --> 22:01.613
That's…

22:03.115 --> 22:04.408
It's really exciting.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.119
Yeah. It is to me anyway.

22:07.744 --> 22:08.745
Yep.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.166
It's an exciting time just to be alive.

22:14.543 --> 22:15.961
-What? Right now?
-Yeah.

22:17.546 --> 22:19.673
I mean,
I wouldn't exactly call it exciting.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.466
Why, because of COVID?

22:22.301 --> 22:23.927
Yeah. And a lot of other things.

22:24.803 --> 22:27.097
Right. But I'm talking on a macro-level.

22:30.684 --> 22:33.312
I don't think it gets much more macro
than a global pandemic.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.396
Sure it does.

22:34.980 --> 22:36.982
This has only been going on
for a few months.

22:37.065 --> 22:40.110
Yeah, but it's gonna keep going on
for probably a long time.

22:40.194 --> 22:42.196
Right. Even if it goes on
for a few more years,

22:42.279 --> 22:43.989
I'm talking about the era we're living in.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.701
I don't know. This feels like
this is the era we're living in.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.249
Do you think it's just gonna get worse
from here on out?

22:54.833 --> 22:56.376
That's what's happening
with a lot of people.

22:57.211 --> 22:58.795
No, not for most people.

22:58.879 --> 23:01.131
Not in the long run,
if you really look at the numbers.

23:01.715 --> 23:02.716
Yeah, but come on.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.093
How about looking at people's lives
and not just numbers?

23:11.975 --> 23:15.270
You know, a lot of my friends,
we've been talking about this.

23:16.355 --> 23:17.981
-About what?
-And…

23:18.065 --> 23:21.235
well, out of all the people that we know,

23:21.318 --> 23:26.031
you know, the ones that are freaking out
about this whole thing are white males.

23:30.369 --> 23:31.954
-And I--
-Okay.

23:32.037 --> 23:37.417
I think it's because, you know,
you guys have always had this privilege

23:37.501 --> 23:40.128
of expecting things to just be fine
and work out.

23:40.212 --> 23:45.008
And now that, you know,
you guys are faced with some adversity,

23:45.092 --> 23:47.344
it could feel like the end of the world.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.434
I don't know what to say.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.817
I mean, yeah.
I'm white and I'm male, and I--

24:03.402 --> 24:04.778
I know that's a privilege.

24:06.613 --> 24:11.368
But I don't think that
I fit into what you're talking about.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.204
I know.

24:15.956 --> 24:18.834
Look, if you think I think
everything's always just gonna work out,

24:19.626 --> 24:21.336
that just means you don't know me.

24:21.420 --> 24:24.798
Like, I never think
that anything's gonna work out.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.015
Maybe that's why you don't finish things.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.028
I should probably get going.

24:46.987 --> 24:47.988
All right.

24:50.616 --> 24:52.117
-Bye.
-Bye.

25:01.877 --> 25:02.878
Damn.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.270
Hi. You've reached Emily Song.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.313
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

26:03.981 --> 26:05.440
Hi, Emily. It's Josh.

26:05.524 --> 26:07.484
I guess I'm leaving you a voice mail.

26:07.568 --> 26:10.237
I don't know if you ever listen
to your voice mails. I don't.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.032
But I wanted to tell you I was sorry,
and I didn't wanna just text that. So…

26:15.784 --> 26:17.661
I really am sorry.

26:18.412 --> 26:21.999
I know I can be negative sometimes,
and it's not how I wanna be.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.335
But also, I was just thinking about

26:25.419 --> 26:28.130
how you were saying
that you don't know anything about music.

26:28.213 --> 26:31.300
Sorry, this is gonna be a long voice mail.
I was just listening to something.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.427
It was "Waterloo Sunset" by The Kinks.

26:33.510 --> 26:36.180
But it actually doesn't matter
what the song is,

26:36.263 --> 26:38.098
and that's sort of the point, that I was--

26:38.182 --> 26:41.226
I was listening to this song
and trying to remember what album it's on,

26:41.310 --> 26:45.480
then what year that album came out,
then other albums that came out that year.

26:45.564 --> 26:48.400
And I realized
I wasn't paying any attention to the song.

26:48.483 --> 26:50.736
I was just, like, so busy

26:50.819 --> 26:53.780
thinking about all these other little,
dumb things that don't matter.

26:53.864 --> 26:56.658
And, if I didn't know any of that stuff,

26:56.742 --> 27:01.663
then maybe I could actually just listen
to the music.

27:01.747 --> 27:03.665
And that made me think…

27:04.750 --> 27:08.170
I'd really like to listen to some music
together, with you, sometime.

27:09.129 --> 27:10.964
'Cause I wanna see how you do it.

27:14.301 --> 27:17.179
I… I really like you.

27:20.474 --> 27:23.018
Okay. Bye.

27:42.538 --> 27:44.915
-Hey. Come on in, man.
-Hi. Thank you.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.960
Welcome. This is the space.

27:48.043 --> 27:49.586
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

27:50.838 --> 27:51.922
All right.

27:52.005 --> 27:55.467
So I'll just get the rest of your payment.

27:55.551 --> 27:58.262
-Credit card?
-I paid on the phone though, right?

27:58.345 --> 28:01.640
Well, you paid half on the phone
and half in person.

28:02.641 --> 28:03.851
Got it, okay.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.104
Okay.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.405
This thing is slow today.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.489
That's fine.

28:19.241 --> 28:20.659
No, didn't go through.

28:21.410 --> 28:22.411
But I mean,

28:22.494 --> 28:25.873
I just paid for the other half
of the session with that same card. So…

28:26.373 --> 28:27.916
-I'll try again.
-Yeah, 'cause the--

28:28.000 --> 28:29.668
Like maybe the thing-- Bit slow.

28:37.676 --> 28:40.179
-No-go. Maybe you're maxed out?
-I'm not maxed out.

28:43.599 --> 28:45.851
-I am maxed out.
-You have another card?

28:45.934 --> 28:49.229
I do, but I never use it is the thing.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.107
'Cause I maxed that one out,

28:52.191 --> 28:54.401
so I started this one
'cause it has a lower interest rate,

28:54.484 --> 28:56.320
and I'm slowly paying back the old one.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.740
Then you probably have enough
to pay for the rest of the session on it.

28:59.823 --> 29:03.577
That's true. I just told myself
I wasn't gonna use that card.

29:11.126 --> 29:12.878
It's the right decision, man.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.507
-It's painful.
-I don't care.

29:19.176 --> 29:20.302
Sorry.

29:21.261 --> 29:23.764
-Can we just go again, please?
-Yep, goin' again.

29:50.332 --> 29:52.209
Now hear this.

30:07.349 --> 30:11.228
Now, here, this

30:11.311 --> 30:14.982
Now, here, this

30:15.065 --> 30:17.025
Nowhere else

30:18.652 --> 30:22.114
Now, here, this

30:22.197 --> 30:25.784
Now, here, this

30:25.868 --> 30:28.495
Nowhere else

30:35.627 --> 30:38.213
-The times
-The time

30:39.256 --> 30:40.591
The time

30:42.593 --> 30:43.886
Okay, okay, o--

30:43.969 --> 30:46.847
Now, here, this

31:09.786 --> 31:11.622
Now hear this.

31:12.456 --> 31:15.292
Now, here, this

31:15.876 --> 31:19.796
Is it possible they do not realize
that we shall never cease?

31:19.880 --> 31:21.632
Nowhere else

31:21.715 --> 31:23.383
We won't cease-- We won't cease--

31:23.467 --> 31:25.344
Now, here

31:27.012 --> 31:29.681
Now, here, this

31:30.265 --> 31:34.019
The task which has been set us
is not above our strength.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.938
Nowhere else

31:36.021 --> 31:37.731
Here we are together.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.483
Now, here

31:41.693 --> 31:44.947
Now, here, this

31:45.030 --> 31:48.158
Now, here, this

31:48.242 --> 31:50.536
Nowhere else

31:52.204 --> 31:54.873
Now, here, this

31:55.874 --> 31:58.377
Now, here, this

31:58.919 --> 32:01.255
-Now you see.
-Nowhere else

32:08.136 --> 32:10.180
Now hear this.

32:10.264 --> 32:12.808
Now hear this. Now--

32:32.119 --> 32:33.370
You wanna hear that one?

32:33.996 --> 32:35.372
Yeah, just give me a sec.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.524
-From the top?
-Yeah. Thank you.
