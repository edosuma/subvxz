00:05.463 --> 00:08.341
- Dr. Ben Song risked
everything when he used

00:08.383 --> 00:11.678
the Quantum Leap Accelerator
to travel back in time.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.514
Now our team's working
to find out why.

00:14.556 --> 00:18.184
As he leaps between bodies
with no memory of who he is,

00:18.226 --> 00:20.270
he still has one hope--

00:20.311 --> 00:24.649
that his next leap
takes him back

00:24.691 --> 00:29.863
to the place and people
he calls home.

[intense music]

[bird cawing]

00:33.950 --> 00:35.702
- Ben, come on!

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
- Be--

00:37.746 --> 00:38.580
[shouts] You know me?

00:38.621 --> 00:40.498
- It's now or never, new guy!

00:40.540 --> 00:42.292
- Go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

00:42.334 --> 00:45.045
- You get back here right now!

Freedom, baby!

01:15.658 --> 01:18.036

01:18.078 --> 01:20.580
- Leah, you slashed their tires
like I showed you?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.624
Are you sure?
- Yeah, Stacy, I'm sure.

01:22.665 --> 01:23.917
[all panting]

01:23.958 --> 01:24.959
We did it.

01:25.001 --> 01:25.960
We escaped.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.379
[light laughter]

01:27.420 --> 01:29.923
- So we just escaped school?

- * Yeah, yeah *

* Yeah, yeah *

01:38.807 --> 01:40.266
* Oh, yeah *

01:40.308 --> 01:41.267
- If you were gonna
change your mind

01:41.309 --> 01:42.644
about escaping that hellhole,

01:42.686 --> 01:43.603
you probably
should have done it

01:43.645 --> 01:45.105
before you stole the car keys.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.272
- Right.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.565
- I gotta hand it to you,
Klepto,

01:47.607 --> 01:49.067
you said you could do it,
and you did.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.069
So where you going to?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.279
- Me?
Uh, I'm--

01:53.321 --> 01:54.781
I'm not--not sure.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.866
- Well, once we get to Reno,
you'll have lots of options,

01:56.908 --> 01:59.869
um, international airport,
train station, bus terminal.

01:59.911 --> 02:00.870
- I'm going to Vegas.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.790
- To be a stripper, right?

02:03.832 --> 02:05.166
Sorry.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.252
- To be a blackjack dealer.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.420
Or craps.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.754
Casinos are hiring like crazy,

02:09.796 --> 02:11.673
and Vegas is a really good
place to start over.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.842
It's better than Alaska,
that's for sure.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.176
- You're going to Alaska?

02:15.218 --> 02:17.220
- Mm-hmm.
Bus to Juneau

- Leah.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.824
You can't go home.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.534
You know that, right?

02:39.576 --> 02:40.744
Your parents sent you away

02:40.785 --> 02:41.870
because they think
you're broken.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.413
- Hey. Take it easy.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.081
- What? I mean, it's true.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.624
I don't want her to walk in
and think they'll suddenly

02:46.666 --> 02:49.169
just accept her for who she is.

02:49.210 --> 02:55.133

02:55.175 --> 02:57.886

who lives out here.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.179
Maybe I'll call him.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.263
He's nice.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.514
I swear, he's on TV.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.433
- The people you know
aren't the answer.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.726
They're the problem.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.186
They already made up
their minds about you.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.480
- That's why you have
to start over as someone new.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.815
It's the only way.

Any blows to the head or--
or pain internally?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.823
- Are you a doctor
all of a sudden?

03:59.864 --> 04:01.032
- No--yes--

04:01.074 --> 04:03.451
just wanna make sure--
- This is so stupid!

It's okay, all right?
It's not your fault.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.006
All right--

happened to you.

04:35.650 --> 04:36.776
I'm just glad you're okay.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.778
- Someone shut us out
of the last leap.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.197
I don't know who it is, but--
- Janis Calavicci.

I've been trying

04:53.001 --> 04:54.044
to reach you all day.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.463
My name is Janis Calavicci.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.089
You don't remember me.

- What?

05:00.592 --> 05:02.135
- Yeah, she appeared
after you were shut out.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.511
Said she was there to warn me.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.597
- Warn you?

05:05.638 --> 05:06.973
About what?
- I-I don't know.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.559
I-I leapt before she could
say anything else.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.769
Do you know who she is?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.979
- Uh, sh--

05:13.021 --> 05:14.189
you were working with her

05:14.230 --> 05:16.149
before you leaped.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.692
Do you remember that?

05:17.734 --> 05:20.528
- Are you sure youwant
to do this?

- Well,
she's a potential threat.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.829
I--I have to talk to the team.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.331
- Gotcha.
I mean--I mean, I'm just--

05:31.373 --> 05:32.499
I'm just happy you're okay.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.000
Uh, you should have seen
the last leap.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.043
I saw a demon.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.628
- [chuckles softly]
You did great.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.671
You don't even need me anymore.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.506
- [huffs] Of course I need you.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.216
I always need you.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.717
[tender music]

05:42.759 --> 05:44.511
So why did I leap here?

05:44.552 --> 05:49.015
- Uh, well,
it is July 10th, 1996.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.684
You are Benjamin Winters,

05:50.725 --> 05:54.354
a 16-year-old student
of Sierra Youth Academy.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.980
Looks like in the original
timeline,

05:56.022 --> 05:58.608
you and three other students
got lost on a school hike

05:58.650 --> 06:00.485
and died of heat exposure.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.861
- That doesn't make any sense.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.530
This does not feel like
a school hiking trip.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.948
More like the Great Escape.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.034
- Okay, I'll have Ian run
a diagnostic on Ziggy,

06:08.076 --> 06:10.954
but until then, just...
keep 'em out of the woods.

06:10.995 --> 06:11.996
[device clicks]

06:12.038 --> 06:14.207
- Do you have
an imaginary friend?

06:14.249 --> 06:17.210
[soft music]

06:17.252 --> 06:18.795
* *

06:18.837 --> 06:23.883
It is, like, one,
or do you have a whole group?

06:23.925 --> 06:25.885
When I was a kid,
I had this family

06:25.927 --> 06:29.180
that I would talk to,
because my family was just...

06:29.222 --> 06:30.181
[sighs]

06:31.725 --> 06:35.729
Well, the therapist said
it was a coping mechanism,

06:35.770 --> 06:37.230
which is maybe
the most obvious thing

06:37.272 --> 06:38.398
in the history of history.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.607
- [chuckles]
- I was like,

06:39.649 --> 06:41.901
do you really need a PhD
to make that call?

06:41.943 --> 06:44.237
- [chuckles]

06:44.279 --> 06:45.822
I talk to my fiancÃ©e.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.325
Girlfriend, I t--
I talk to my girl--

06:49.367 --> 06:51.244
I'm 16.
[chuckles]

06:51.286 --> 06:53.329
It's my girlfriend.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.373
- Have you ever had a real one,

06:55.415 --> 06:58.001
a girlfriend?

06:58.043 --> 06:59.419
- Yeah.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.129
- I did too.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.256
* *

07:03.298 --> 07:04.549
- Was it nice?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.093
- Yeah.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.428
Yeah, it was.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.264
* *

07:11.306 --> 07:13.266
Oh, Stacy has a plan.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.476
- Okay, great.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.358
- Janis cut our connection
to Ben?

07:21.399 --> 07:22.776
How's that possible?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.277
- Well, she must have
her own imaging chamber,

07:24.319 --> 07:25.487
and a handlink.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.364
- The one she took
from her mother's house.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.283
- Ian, tell me you can stop
Janis from doing this again.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.452
- I reprogrammed the OS
in the imaging chamber.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.995
It--it won't happen again.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.539
- Ben said that she was there
to warn him about something.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.541
- About what?
- The other leaper?

07:38.583 --> 07:39.709
- She didn't have time to say.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.252
But if she was there
to warn him,

07:41.294 --> 07:44.130
then that means Ben's
in danger from something,

07:44.172 --> 07:47.217
and right now Janis is the only
person who knows what that is.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.345
- You guys might get the chance
to ask her very soon.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.596
[suspenseful music]

07:51.638 --> 07:52.972
The power requirements

07:53.014 --> 07:55.684
for Janis' imaging chamber
are the same as ours.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.061
So since we know when she was
trying to get in...

07:58.103 --> 08:01.147
- You can look for local power
surges at corresponding times

08:01.189 --> 08:02.982
and find her.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.152
* *

08:06.194 --> 08:07.737
- What are you doing?
- Getting something to wear

08:07.779 --> 08:09.698
instead of this
godforsaken uniform.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.032
Also taking stock
of what I have.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
Unfortunately, what's good
for Vegas isn't great

08:12.867 --> 08:14.911
for the middle of nowhere, so.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.913
- Ben, from what I can tell,

08:16.955 --> 08:18.915
the school tried to cover up
what happened.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.876
They claim that you all
got lost on a hiking trip.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.671
But a few weeks later,
the director, Adam Sullivan,

08:24.713 --> 08:27.173
put in an insurance claim
for his car.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.883
Claimed it rolled over
right here.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.093
- What kind
of person does that?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.886
- I don't know.
But you have to get

08:31.928 --> 08:33.304
these kids back on the road.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.183
In the original timeline,
they went south, split up,

08:37.225 --> 08:38.268
and none of 'em made it.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.354
* *

08:41.396 --> 08:42.522
- Guys...
[sighs]

08:42.564 --> 08:43.648
I think we should talk--

08:43.690 --> 08:45.150
- I got some things we can use.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.736
- Look, um, I understand
the idea was to leave school--

08:47.777 --> 08:49.487
- Way to live up
to your nickname, Klepto.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.031
- [laughs] No way.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.324
You stole Director Sullivan's
fishing trophy?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.659
He loves this thing.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.869
- He stole something
from every one

08:55.910 --> 08:57.245
of the sadists
who work at that place.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.581
- Ringer's hat? Ohh.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.999
What I would give
for that son of a bitch

09:01.041 --> 09:02.083
to see me wearing this
right now.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.209
[laughter]

09:03.251 --> 09:05.003
- Okay, we were just
in a car crash.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.421
So--
- Water, sunscreen,

09:06.463 --> 09:07.756
a compass, and a map?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.341
- Yeah, I figured
if the car didn't start,

09:09.382 --> 09:10.759
we might have to go on foot.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.177
- Leah, I know I give you crap
about being a genius,

09:12.218 --> 09:13.845
but I will never do that again.
[laughter]

09:13.887 --> 09:15.055
- Okay, everybody, stop!

09:17.307 --> 09:19.059
Okay?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.894
- No wonder people yell
at teenagers.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.562
- What exactly do you think
is gonna happen?

09:22.604 --> 09:25.065
We're just gonna hike to Reno?

09:26.524 --> 09:27.734
- You got a better idea?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.861
- Yeah. We go back to the road.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.988
- No way. No, they're
looking for us by now.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.574
- Look, I get the idea was
to run away from school,

09:34.616 --> 09:35.909
but getting lost in the woods

09:35.950 --> 09:37.452
isn't gonna
accomplish anything.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.579
- We won't get lost.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.331
We've got a map.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.250
[sighs] Okay.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.086
There's Susanville.
It's not too far.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.171
We'll get to Reno from there.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.383
Look for a place called
the Elbow's Bend.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.884
There's a cabin there--

09:52.926 --> 09:54.427
the place the Benito brothers
went to when they escaped.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.471
- Oh, no, that's right.
I've heard about that before.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.847
- It can't be more
than five miles.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.182
We get there tonight, rest up,

09:59.224 --> 10:00.433
hike to Susanville
in the morning.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.935
- Okay, not to sound
like a broken record,

10:01.976 --> 10:03.937
but this is exactly
what must not happen.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.064
- Yeah, five miles
in this terrain?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.149
That's gonna take a whole day
right there.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.609
We've got no food.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.945
We've got one bottle of water
between the four of us.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.905
And I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

10:13.947 --> 10:15.573
but this isn't some game, okay?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.367
We get lost, we will die.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.410
- Don't exaggerate.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.412
- I promise,
I am not exaggerating.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.415
If we do this, you're never
gonna make it to Vegas.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.916
You won't make it to Alaska.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.293
And you're never gonna get
to see your folks.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.378
We're gonna die.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.046
- You've only been here
a few weeks,

10:30.088 --> 10:32.590
so you probably won't get this.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.302
But I would gladly die before
I ever go back to that school.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.763
[tense music]

10:38.805 --> 10:39.806
- Me too.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.266
- Me three.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.853
- Come on.
We can get changed on the way.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.396
- You can go back.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.315
No judgement.
Just, um,

10:49.357 --> 10:51.484
make sure you don't tell them
where we're going.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.945
* *

10:53.987 --> 10:56.322
- [sighs]
Ben, you have to stop this.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.743
* *

10:59.784 --> 11:01.661
- Can you make sure
we don't get lost?

11:01.703 --> 11:03.455
- Y-yes, but Ben, this--

11:03.496 --> 11:05.665
- You do that,
I'll keep them alive.

11:05.707 --> 11:11.379
* *

11:11.421 --> 11:14.841
[suspenseful music]

11:14.883 --> 11:17.886
[cell phone ringing]

11:26.895 --> 11:28.104
[message tone beeps]

11:30.940 --> 11:34.319
[pulsing beep]

11:34.361 --> 11:35.236
- [chuckles softly]

11:37.030 --> 11:38.448
- Where?
- A warehouse,

11:38.490 --> 11:40.867
three miles east, rented
by a shell corp six months ago.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.744
- Right when Ben
and Janis started doing

11:42.786 --> 11:44.120
whatever it is they're doing.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.081
- Our tactical unit will
meet us once we get up top.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.874
And I got a backup unit
scrambling out of Torrance.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.376
- Is that enough?

11:49.417 --> 11:50.669
- Janis is a lone wolf.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.253
She's gone to a lot of trouble
to stay hidden.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.422
I'd be surprised if she hired
even one security guard,

11:54.464 --> 11:57.759
lest she risk them stumbling
onto something.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.678
- That sounds like admiration.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.222
- Just one shark
recognizing another.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.730
- So your dad reached out
to me.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.732
Says you're not
taking his calls.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.693
- Yeah,
there's a reason I'm not.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.403
We're about to capture Janis.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.238
You of all people should know
now's not the time

12:18.279 --> 12:20.031
to let anything get in our way.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.449
[machinery clunks]

12:21.491 --> 12:25.495
* *

12:25.537 --> 12:26.871
That doesn't make any sense.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.040
It says the whole office
is under lockdown protocol,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.208
as if we're under attack.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.294
[alarm blaring,
indistinct chatter]

12:35.714 --> 12:37.549
I didn't give the command.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.510
- Janis still has access
to our system, right?

12:40.552 --> 12:43.513
Would her access include, say,

12:43.555 --> 12:45.015
elevator cameras?

12:45.056 --> 12:49.060
* *

12:49.102 --> 12:50.186
- She saw us coming,

12:50.228 --> 12:51.938
and she's buying herself
time to get away.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.149
- [huffs]
Like you said,

12:54.190 --> 12:55.483
a shark.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.694
* *

12:57.736 --> 12:59.904
- Their chemistry
is undeniable.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.823
I mean, it makes me,
like, emotional.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.324
- I've never heard
of them before.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.909
- Wait till you hear "Wannabe."

13:04.951 --> 13:06.119
It's the new
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

13:06.161 --> 13:07.120
They're releasing it
in the States soon.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.663
- What do we know about them?

13:08.705 --> 13:10.790
Maybe if we know them better,
I know how to help.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.584
- Okay, Roy Bacall,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.211
the only child
of very successful parents.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.504
High IQ, but has flunked out

13:16.546 --> 13:18.298
of every school
he's ever been to.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.551
Had two overdoses
before he got sent to Sierra.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.803
The second one they didn't
think was an accident.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.263
[soft dramatic music]

13:25.305 --> 13:27.390
Stacy Thompson, star athlete,

13:27.432 --> 13:29.934
voted "most popular"
freshman year of high school

13:29.976 --> 13:32.520
until her mom died
in a car accident.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.522
Looks like her dad was
an alcoholic.

13:34.564 --> 13:38.443
She engaged in an escalating
series of physical altercations

13:38.485 --> 13:41.279
on and off school grounds
until she was sent to Sierra

13:41.321 --> 13:44.324
after trying to burn down
her own house.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.493
- [sighs]
Lost her mom freshman year,

13:46.534 --> 13:49.829
so she was a year younger
than I was when I lost my mom.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.873
- Leah Valencia,
the youngest daughter

13:51.915 --> 13:54.209
of a very religious family.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.002
She has a dozen
different diagnoses

13:56.044 --> 13:57.712
from a dozen
different psychiatrists--

13:57.754 --> 14:01.549
depression, anxiety, ADHD.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.885
I mean, despite that,
she was a straight A student.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.346
I mean, like,
100s on every test.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.264
Her parents sent her to Sierra

14:08.306 --> 14:11.351
after she was discovered
cutting herself.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.687
- [sighs]
Addison, I know each leap

14:13.728 --> 14:14.854
is a challenge, but this one...

14:14.896 --> 14:16.523
- Yeah. It's a lot.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.650
- These three kids don't have
a single supportive person

14:18.692 --> 14:20.193
in their lives between them.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.278
- Well,
four if you include yourself.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.740
Ben Winters was a socially
challenged introvert,

14:25.782 --> 14:27.701
diagnosed with Asperger's.

14:27.742 --> 14:31.371
Looks like he channeled most
of his anger into stealing.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.332
- So, she hot?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.335
Imaginary girlfriend, she hot?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.295
- [laughs]
- Hope so.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.672
Otherwise, what's the point?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.382
- [scoffs]

14:42.424 --> 14:43.591
Cute kid.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.176
Ben, look at them.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.720
They're exhausted.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.514
- Stacy, maybe we should stop
before it gets any darker.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.808
- No way. We haven't even
made it over the ridge.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.685
- You got some torch we don't
know about, or do you just

14:53.727 --> 14:55.061
think we'll be able
to keep going by moonlight?

14:55.103 --> 14:56.062
- No,
but I don't think we should

14:56.104 --> 14:57.230
stop until we have to.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.941
- Well, this is us saying
we have to.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.651
- Hey, go easy on that water.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.486
It's all we've got.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.239
- Ben, it's supposed to be
over 100 degrees tomorrow.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.491
- It has to last all of us
until we get to the cabin.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.244
- And Ziggy says there's
no record of any cabin.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.580
- Klepto was right
about one thing,

15:13.621 --> 15:15.081
we're not making it
five miles tonight.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.082
So let's not make
a bad situation

15:16.124 --> 15:17.417
worse by getting lost.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.419
- Or by getting obnoxious
with each other, right?

15:19.461 --> 15:22.130
- Okay, hey, guys, okay,
we're--we're all tired

15:22.172 --> 15:24.424
and--and hungry, and I know
I've said this before,

15:24.466 --> 15:26.676
but if we turn around now,
the road's not that far.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.762
- What part of not going back

15:28.803 --> 15:31.514
don't you understand?
both: Roy, come on!

15:31.556 --> 15:34.476
[tense music]

15:34.517 --> 15:37.854
* *

15:37.896 --> 15:39.105
- Fine!

15:39.147 --> 15:40.774
You all win.
We will stop here

15:40.815 --> 15:42.192
for the night.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.985
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.405
- He just gets like that
when...

15:47.447 --> 15:48.406
yeah.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.078
[insects chirping, owl hooting]

- I don't suppose there's
a gun in there I didn't see.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.209
- Any suggestions what to do?

16:48.383 --> 16:50.593
- Leah, you okay?

16:50.635 --> 16:51.636
- Yes.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.930
The best response...
[growls]

16:53.972 --> 16:55.140
[wolves barking]

16:55.181 --> 16:56.391
To any predator...

16:56.433 --> 16:59.144
[growls]
Is to become a bigger...

16:59.185 --> 17:00.729
[growls]
Scarier predator.

17:00.770 --> 17:01.980
- Don't take this
the wrong way,

17:02.022 --> 17:03.982
but just to confirm,
you are an actual genius?

17:04.024 --> 17:06.735
- No, Ben, she's right.
If you run or act afraid,

17:06.776 --> 17:07.819
they'll attack.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.113

17:33.928 --> 17:37.307
[soft music]

17:37.349 --> 17:38.850
[building laughter]
- It worked.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.185
It actually worked.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.936
[laughter]

17:41.978 --> 17:43.438
- Nice work.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.068
So, uh, we're taking shifts
sleeping, right?

17:48.109 --> 17:49.319
- Yeah, you bet your ass.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.695
- Okay.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.907
[laughter]

17:59.245 --> 18:02.040
- Your girlfriend here?

18:02.082 --> 18:03.875
- [chuckles softly]

18:03.917 --> 18:05.210
No.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.629
She needs her rest.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.300
Can't sleep?

18:12.342 --> 18:13.843
- Side effects of...

18:15.261 --> 18:16.638
Ironic, right?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.473
You'd think it'd be
the other way around.

18:18.515 --> 18:22.018
I'm sorry...about before,

18:22.060 --> 18:23.561
pushing you like that.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.272
Worst part is, I hate it

18:26.314 --> 18:28.525
when my dad puts
his hands on me.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.568
Promised I'd never be like him,

18:30.610 --> 18:33.613
says every kid ever.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.240
- Ben, I was in the military
with people

18:35.281 --> 18:37.951
who were sent
to place like this.

18:37.992 --> 18:42.580
They always said the worst
part was that nobody cared.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.333
Nobody cared
if they ate breakfast.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.961
Nobody cared
how they did in school.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.671
And nobody listened.

18:49.713 --> 18:52.090
That's all anyone
at this age wants.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.259
Talk to him.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.136
Talk to him like you would
one of us.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.097
[soft dramatic music]

18:59.139 --> 19:01.599
* *

19:01.641 --> 19:04.811
- I have a friend.
He's a physicist.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.105
And he does this thing
where he talks about life

19:07.147 --> 19:08.606
in terms of physics.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.776
- Maybe not literally
like you'd talk to u-us.

19:11.818 --> 19:12.777
Okay. All right.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.612
- Your friend sounds like
a riot.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.906
- It's actually more helpful
than you'd think.

19:16.948 --> 19:20.410
For example, he'll talk
about states of matter.

19:20.452 --> 19:24.122
Like, water, you heat it
and heat it and heat it,

19:24.164 --> 19:25.540
and nothing ever happens.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.960
So you swear that--
that it will never change,

19:29.002 --> 19:30.170
try as it might.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.505
Until one day, poof.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.757
It's steam.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.552
You didn't try
anything new that day.

19:37.594 --> 19:40.597
You just never quit trying
to change it.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.349
- Your friend couldn't
just say,

19:42.390 --> 19:43.808
"don't quit trying to quit"?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.478
- [chuckles]

19:46.519 --> 19:49.564
- Well, this "water" here

19:49.606 --> 19:52.484
has actually quit before.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.236
I was sober before I got
to Sierra Academy.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.780
And then I talked back,

19:56.821 --> 20:00.325
and they put me in the box.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.326
- The box?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.994
[dramatic beat]

20:03.036 --> 20:05.455
- You know the one,
in the parking lot.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.581
Size of a...

20:06.623 --> 20:08.500
[suspenseful music]

20:08.541 --> 20:10.460
Thing no one should be put in.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.170
Two days in there,

20:12.212 --> 20:16.925
two days of Ringer
and his crew telling me

20:16.966 --> 20:19.386
I was worthless,

20:19.427 --> 20:20.929
and I believed 'em.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.932
- Ben, I don't think this is
just about saving their lives.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.809
I think there might
be more to this.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.438
- Have you checked with
the engineering department?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.357
- Yes, and surprise,
they are trapped

20:32.399 --> 20:33.983
in their offices,
just like everyone else.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.860
- Ian, we gotta
get out of here.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.654
- Oh! Oh, you wanna--
you wanna get out?

20:37.696 --> 20:38.697
I mean--
[laughs]

20:38.738 --> 20:39.698
Why didn't I think of that?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.116
It's--it's not like

20:41.157 --> 20:44.160
every single other
department isn't also trying

20:44.202 --> 20:45.620
to call me every 30 seconds,

20:45.662 --> 20:46.746
or that I'm trying
to figure out

20:46.788 --> 20:48.998
how to lift this lockdown
by myself,

20:49.040 --> 20:50.834
or that I have
to monitor Ben's leaps.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.378
I mean, that would be crazy.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.381
Oh, wait, yes,
it is exactly like that.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.632
- Feel better now?

20:57.674 --> 21:00.385
- I, uh--I am working
as fast as I can,

21:00.427 --> 21:03.054
but it's--
it's gonna be a while.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.472
- [sighs]

21:06.558 --> 21:07.934
So...

21:10.103 --> 21:11.229
Should we talk about it?

21:11.271 --> 21:13.148
- Given how you literally
have me trapped

21:13.189 --> 21:15.400
with no ability to walk away?

21:15.442 --> 21:16.943
Sure, let's talk about it.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.240
[soft dramatic music]

21:22.282 --> 21:23.575
- He's your father.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.702
- He's a con man
with a gambling problem

21:25.744 --> 21:27.412
who left me to raise myself.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.580
[laughs humorlessly]

21:28.621 --> 21:29.831
If I didn't have
a really strong group

21:29.873 --> 21:31.291
of friends to lean on--

21:31.332 --> 21:34.544
and a guardian angel...

21:34.586 --> 21:37.088
- What can I say?
I know talent when I see it.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.215
- Every few years,
he reaches out,

21:39.257 --> 21:40.925
says he wants to reconnect.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.053
And every few years, I say yes

21:43.094 --> 21:45.722
because I'm an adult
and what's the harm, right?

21:45.764 --> 21:48.058
But somehow, every few years,

21:48.099 --> 21:51.144
when he disappears
after I've lent him money,

21:51.186 --> 21:54.147
I'm still disappointed.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.940
Like Lucy with the football.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.776
- Charlie Brown.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.028
It's Charlie who wants
to kick the football.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.238
Lucy's the one
who always pulls away.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.239
- You get my point.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.827
- Yes. I do.

22:07.869 --> 22:10.872
But take it from a father
who's made a lot of mistakes,

22:10.914 --> 22:13.541
it's better to risk
disappointment than to give up.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.168
- That sounds great
for a greeting card.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.587
But it's not always the case
in real life.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.547
- Just think about it.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.716
* *

22:21.758 --> 22:24.678
[tense music]

22:24.719 --> 22:31.851
* *

22:34.813 --> 22:37.857
[insects buzzing,
birds chirping]

22:41.861 --> 22:44.155
- It's not withdrawal.

22:44.197 --> 22:47.200
No, I'm just about to collapse
from heat exhaustion.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.328
- Ben, Leah's flagging.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.790
* *

22:53.832 --> 22:56.835
- Stacy, we need
to take a break.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.253
Stacy--
- We've taken three breaks

22:58.294 --> 22:59.295
this morning.

22:59.337 --> 23:00.588
- Well, then maybe
we should stop,

23:00.630 --> 23:02.007
sit in the shade
until it cools off.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.508
- We can't stop!

23:03.550 --> 23:05.510
Look, you were right.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.970
This is harder than I thought.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.179
But we have to keep going,

23:08.221 --> 23:09.973
and you and I need
to look strong for them,

23:10.015 --> 23:12.934
because we have a way to go,
and I--

23:12.976 --> 23:15.353
I gave Leah the last
of our water ten minutes ago.

23:15.395 --> 23:19.941
* *

23:19.983 --> 23:21.234
- [sighs]

23:21.276 --> 23:23.778
- Ben, Elbow Bend is still
over two miles away,

23:23.820 --> 23:26.698
and Ziggy says the odds suck
no matter what you do.

23:26.740 --> 23:29.367
- I keep thinking
about that box, Addison,

23:29.409 --> 23:31.036
back at the school,

23:31.077 --> 23:33.705
the one they stick you in
and leave you for days.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.123
[suspenseful music]

23:35.165 --> 23:37.667
There's probably a kid in it
right now.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.877
- I know.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.587
- You said it yourself,
this is more

23:40.628 --> 23:43.006
than just about
me saving their lives.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.842
I was sent here
to help them escape,

23:45.884 --> 23:49.012
and I will help them escape.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.388
- [screams]

23:50.430 --> 23:52.515
[suspenseful music]

23:52.557 --> 23:54.726
[crying out]

23:54.768 --> 23:55.810
- What happened?
- [wincing]

23:55.852 --> 23:58.104
I stepped in a snake hole.
It hurts!

23:58.146 --> 23:59.689
- Leah, I'm just gonna
take a look at your ankle.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.107
Okay?
- Uh-huh.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.233
[wincing]

24:02.275 --> 24:03.526
[screams]

24:03.568 --> 24:05.403
[sobbing]

24:05.445 --> 24:06.404
- It's broken.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.948
* *

24:14.329 --> 24:15.622
- Her foot got caught
in a snake hole.

24:15.663 --> 24:16.748
They're--they're everywhere.
- Okay,

24:16.790 --> 24:18.917
I don't want anyone
to panic, okay?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.044
My mom used to say,
the more scared you are,

24:21.086 --> 24:23.421
the more fear you have
as fuel to fix things.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.673
- In that case, your mom
should know I could power

24:24.714 --> 24:26.675
a 747 right now.

24:26.716 --> 24:27.759
- No, Ben is right.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.386
We have to focus.
What do we do?

24:29.427 --> 24:32.055
- First, we're gonna build
a world-class splint for Leah.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.640
Then, we're gonna get
to that creek.

24:33.682 --> 24:35.517
- It's 2.1 miles
as the crow flies,

24:35.558 --> 24:36.935
but it's at least downhill.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.103
- Water is the only thing
we need.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.854
We can go hungry for weeks
if we have to.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.648
- But we won't have to.

24:41.690 --> 24:42.857
I'm sure that cabin
will have food.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.275
- Ben, I checked again.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.612
Ziggy says there's no cabin
for, like, a dozen miles.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.738
- [cries out]
- Okay.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.115
Here's what we need
for that splint.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.033
- All right, you need
to stabilize the joint.

24:52.075 --> 24:54.244
Find two branches.
- We need two branches.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.287
- All right, we need some kind
of cushion and a cord.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.249
- Okay, do you have some
T-shirts and a belt, maybe?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.667
- All right, now you just
gotta secure the ankle.

25:00.709 --> 25:03.128
- Now we just have
to secure the ankle.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.170
Ready?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.717
- Okay, that splint should
allow Leah to stand on her own

25:08.758 --> 25:10.468
and walk with assistance.

25:10.510 --> 25:13.138
[soft dramatic music]

25:13.179 --> 25:14.472
- Okay.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.932
I'll get better at it.

25:15.974 --> 25:18.309
- Nice job, imaginary hottie.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.897
- It is nice
to be acknowledged.

25:22.939 --> 25:24.816
- Everybody ready?

25:24.858 --> 25:27.485
Next stop, the creek.

25:27.527 --> 25:33.366
* *

25:33.408 --> 25:35.326
- Here, you can have
my painkillers.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.327
- You sure?

25:36.369 --> 25:37.996
- Yeah.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.331
I don't need 'em anymore.

25:40.373 --> 25:46.379
* *

25:46.421 --> 25:47.547
[alarm blaring]

25:47.589 --> 25:49.799
- Well, uh, I'd--
I'd like to say

25:49.841 --> 25:51.676
that I know how much longer
this might take,

25:51.718 --> 25:53.887
but unfortunately--
or fortunately--

25:53.928 --> 25:55.722
I'm not Jenn,
so I still have no idea

25:55.764 --> 25:57.057
how much longer
it's gonna take.

25:57.098 --> 25:57.932
- [sighs]

25:57.974 --> 25:58.850
- Not a time for jokes?

25:58.892 --> 26:00.018
Okay, noted.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.896
[suspenseful music]

26:02.937 --> 26:04.939
Uh, hey, Addison,
I don't suppose

26:04.981 --> 26:06.691
that you would mind coming out
of the imaging chamber

26:06.733 --> 26:09.402
to help me free Magic and Jenn.

26:09.444 --> 26:11.988
- No, I can't right now.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.491
I will as soon as I can.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.368
[sighs]
Okay, Ben,

26:16.409 --> 26:18.828
it's only about a quarter mile
to the creek.

26:18.870 --> 26:22.874
- Wow.
I really can't feel anything.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.834
- How many did you give her?

26:24.876 --> 26:26.878
- One, I swear.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.213
- Do these pills
make you chatty?

26:28.254 --> 26:30.006
I feel like they're
making me chatty.

26:30.048 --> 26:32.884
It's funny because usually
I like to feel pain.

26:32.926 --> 26:35.053
That's weird, right?

26:35.095 --> 26:36.513
They say it's about control.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.182
Like, people who self-harm are
actually seeking control,

26:39.224 --> 26:40.767
which makes sense
because for me,

26:40.809 --> 26:44.771
it doesn't matter how well I do
in school or anything else.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.606
I'm interested in girls.

26:46.648 --> 26:49.025
Just so happens that means
that my mom and dad think

26:49.067 --> 26:50.402
that I'm going to hell.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.862
And Stacy,
I know you would just tell me

26:52.904 --> 26:53.947
not to care what they think,

26:53.988 --> 26:55.949
but I can't help it.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.742
I love them.

26:57.784 --> 27:00.161
- Can you forgive them,

27:00.203 --> 27:02.789
show them the kindness
that they couldn't give you?

27:02.831 --> 27:06.251
- And who exactly
will that help?

27:06.292 --> 27:07.460
- Her.

27:07.502 --> 27:08.712
It'll help her.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.672
- Maybe.

27:10.714 --> 27:14.426
I mean, all my life, I just
assumed I was a misfit toy,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.011
like, broken in the box.

27:16.052 --> 27:18.346
But it seems like
you guys don't feel that way.

27:18.388 --> 27:21.224
Like, maybe to you
I'm not weird.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.269
- Leah, we don't think you're
weird because you're not weird.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.937
- Yeah.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.939
We think you're kind of great.

27:27.981 --> 27:29.649
- You do?
- Yeah.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.443
Then again, look at us.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.986
You really wanna be lumped in
with this group?

27:33.028 --> 27:34.320
That's a low bar.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

27:46.082 --> 27:47.584
- There's no water.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.627
- On all the maps,
this was a blue line.

27:49.669 --> 27:52.422

a dry year for runoff.

this is the leap.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.473
There's no way.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.766
- Ben?

28:02.807 --> 28:06.019

this is the leap!

to his friend.

28:10.815 --> 28:13.485

There's no way.

right?

28:27.499 --> 28:28.333
That's not natural.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.709
- That's because it's a pipe.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.253
- An intake pipe--
for fresh water.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.422
It's illegal to draw water
from a creek like this,

28:34.464 --> 28:36.007
but that doesn't mean
people don't do it,

28:36.049 --> 28:38.677

to live off the grid

28:38.718 --> 28:41.012

28:41.054 --> 28:42.681

there's a generator out back.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.104
Should I try to power it up?

29:31.146 --> 29:32.772
- No, no, no. No need.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.065
We got lights.

29:34.107 --> 29:36.109
- What about food?

29:36.151 --> 29:38.236
- Tons of food. Like, so much.

Take your pick. There's
a full cupboard back there.

Okay, he's really cool.

Just an observation.

- Wait, wait, wait.
What is this?

37:06.810 --> 37:08.937
- That's my question for you.

37:08.978 --> 37:10.105
What is going on here exactly?

37:10.146 --> 37:11.898
What is your name?
- His name's Ringer,

37:11.940 --> 37:13.692
'cause he likes
to ring our bell.

37:13.733 --> 37:16.152
You like my hat?

37:16.194 --> 37:17.946
- You, you're the director
of Sierra Academy,

37:17.987 --> 37:20.115
isn't that right--
Director Sullivan, I believe?

37:20.156 --> 37:21.199
- Uh--
- What were you doing

37:21.241 --> 37:22.283
to my niece?
What are you doing

37:22.325 --> 37:23.618
to the kids
that come here for help?

37:23.660 --> 37:24.703
- No comment.

37:24.744 --> 37:26.788
Now, this is private property.

37:26.830 --> 37:28.790
I'm calling the police.

37:30.208 --> 37:33.712
- Rest assured,
they're already on their way.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.380
- Wanna guess who goes
into a box next?

37:37.257 --> 37:38.967
- Well, have forensics
go over the place

37:39.009 --> 37:40.802
and let me know
if you find anything.

37:40.844 --> 37:43.096
[soft dramatic music]

37:43.138 --> 37:45.306
- Gone?
- With all her most crucial

37:45.348 --> 37:48.727
equipment stripped out
of her imaging chamber.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.521
- Don't worry. You'll get her.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.565
- How do you know that?

37:53.606 --> 37:55.525
- Because you're you.

37:55.567 --> 37:56.818
You never give up.

37:56.860 --> 38:03.992
* *

38:10.582 --> 38:13.835
- Hey, Dad. How's it going?

38:13.877 --> 38:16.046
No, sorry, I was busy.

38:17.339 --> 38:21.301
[chuckles]
No, I haven't eaten yet.

38:21.343 --> 38:25.221
I guess I could go
for some dim sum.

38:25.263 --> 38:28.350
* *

38:28.391 --> 38:30.393
- You came back.

38:30.435 --> 38:31.978
I was hoping you might.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.022
- It was all Klepto's idea.

38:34.064 --> 38:37.359
- Yeah, but calling
your uncle was Stacy's.

38:37.400 --> 38:38.693
- What?

38:38.735 --> 38:39.694
I listen.

38:39.736 --> 38:41.237
- [chuckles]

38:41.279 --> 38:43.198
- We're gonna get you all out
of here in a few minutes.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.407
I just wanna make sure
you're all comfortable

38:44.449 --> 38:45.909
with going on record.
- Oh, with pleasure.

38:45.950 --> 38:48.661
- Not just with the press--
the police, CPS, everybody.

38:48.703 --> 38:49.829
- You sure it'll change things?

38:49.871 --> 38:52.916
- Whew. Big time.

38:52.957 --> 38:54.751
- I have a pretty good
feeling it will.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.586
- Sierra Youth Academy
is shut down.

38:56.628 --> 38:59.214
Director Sullivan and several
members of his staff

38:59.255 --> 39:01.716
are indicted on multiple counts
of child endangerment,

39:01.758 --> 39:05.970
and Leah's uncle does a whole
series of investigative reports

39:06.012 --> 39:07.389
about child youth camps

39:07.430 --> 39:09.599
just like this one
all around the Southwest.

39:09.641 --> 39:12.268
- What about the kids?
They're gonna be okay?

39:12.310 --> 39:14.062
- Who's he talking to?
- Shh. Don't interrupt.

39:14.104 --> 39:15.647
- Stacy moved to Vegas.

39:15.689 --> 39:17.232
She's managing a casino.

39:17.273 --> 39:19.651
Roy lives in Boston,
has four kids,

39:19.693 --> 39:20.944
and runs a group home.

39:20.985 --> 39:23.488
Leah is a rocket scientist--
shocker.

39:23.530 --> 39:24.781
And you're a sculptor.

39:24.823 --> 39:27.117
Life isn't always easy,
but they stay friends.

39:27.158 --> 39:28.743
Even go on vacations together.

39:28.785 --> 39:29.744
- Hm.

39:29.786 --> 39:31.246
Friends for life.

39:31.287 --> 39:33.581
* *

39:33.623 --> 39:37.168
Oh, after this, I think we're
gonna be friends for life.

39:37.210 --> 39:38.420
- Yeah, we can be pen pals.

39:38.461 --> 39:41.089
- Or, I don't know,
use a phone.

39:41.131 --> 39:43.299
- Am I the only one
who's heard of email?

39:43.341 --> 39:45.927
- Um, yeah, did you think
I meant snail mail?

39:45.969 --> 39:47.595
- What's sn--oh.

39:47.637 --> 39:50.223
I get it.
[laughter]

39:51.975 --> 39:53.685
- Friends for life.

39:53.727 --> 39:56.312
Promise?

39:56.354 --> 39:57.731
- Promise.

39:57.772 --> 40:00.608
- Promise.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.193
- Promise.

40:02.819 --> 40:03.778
- Promise.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.947
[dramatic music]

40:05.989 --> 40:07.449
I have to do this.

40:07.490 --> 40:08.700
* *

40:08.742 --> 40:10.618
Promise me
you'll see this through,

40:10.660 --> 40:11.661
no matter what happens.

40:11.703 --> 40:12.996
- If you're right about this,

40:13.038 --> 40:14.372
what choice do I have?

40:14.414 --> 40:15.957
* *

40:15.999 --> 40:19.127
- Would you just excuse me
for just one moment?

40:21.504 --> 40:23.465
- Ben?

40:23.506 --> 40:24.674
You okay?

40:24.716 --> 40:27.302
- I, um...

40:27.344 --> 40:28.887
I remember.

40:28.928 --> 40:31.639
* *

40:31.681 --> 40:32.974
- Remember what?

40:33.016 --> 40:35.977
- Are you sure youwant
to do this?

40:36.019 --> 40:38.688
- It's the only chance
we've got.

40:38.730 --> 40:40.774
Why I leapt in the first place.

40:40.815 --> 40:43.568
* *

40:43.610 --> 40:45.403
It's to save you.

40:47.364 --> 40:48.948
- What?

40:48.990 --> 40:53.912
* *
