WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:02.794
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:02.794 --> 00:04.588
LAYLA: WHAT IF MY MOM
KILLED HERSELF?

00:04.588 --> 00:08.425
I WAS GONNA BRAKE, BUT THERE WAS
A MOMENT WHERE I HESITATED.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.927
I NEED HELP.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.763
COREY: THIS GONNA BE OUR
LAST WEEKEND TOGETHER
AS A FAMILY.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.599
DAD!

00:15.599 --> 00:17.476
I'M THE 57th-RANKED
PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY,

00:17.476 --> 00:19.269
BUT IT'S NOT
MAKING ME FEEL BETTER.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.313
I'M NOT GONNA PLAY FOOTBALL
NO MORE.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.731
IT WAS MY WAY
OF CONNECTING WITH YOU.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.316
NOW IT JUST HURTS
TOO MUCH TO PLAY.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.902
TYRONE: YOU THOUGHT YOU
WERE SMARTER THAN ME, HUH?

00:26.902 --> 00:30.113
I PUT MY FAITH IN PEOPLE
LIKE SHAWN AND PREACH,

00:30.113 --> 00:31.531
AND YOU TOOK THEM OUT.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.825
-JUST BUSINESS.
-LAPD! DROP THE GUN!

00:33.825 --> 00:35.202
COOP: I'LL SEE
YOU IN A MINUTE.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.162
WHAT'S GOOD, COOP?

00:45.120 --> 00:47.040
WHAT'S GOOD, TY?

00:50.670 --> 00:53.300
BOUNCE UP OUT OF
HERE, COOP.

00:59.510 --> 01:02.140
PROTECTING SNITCHES NOW?

01:02.140 --> 01:03.850
THIS ABOUT ME AND YOU.

01:03.850 --> 01:05.730
COOP AIN'T THE ONE
WHO SHOT ME.

01:05.730 --> 01:08.350
I'LL LEAVE YOUR
DOG ASS STRETCHED
OUT RIGHT HERE.

01:08.350 --> 01:11.940
YOU COULD,
BUT THAT PROBABLY AIN'T
THE BEST IDEA, THOUGH.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.820
BECAUSE COOP WILL BE DEAD
BEFORE MY BODY EVEN COLD.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.910
HOW THE HELL DID
TYRONE GET OUT?

01:19.910 --> 01:22.040
MAN, I HAVE NO IDEA.
I CALLED MRS. BAKER
ON THE WAY OVER HERE,

01:22.040 --> 01:23.660
AND NEITHER DOES SHE.
SHE SAID SHE
WOULD MAKE SOME CALLS.

01:23.660 --> 01:25.250
ALL RIGHT. COOP, I KNOW
YOU STRESSING,

01:25.250 --> 01:26.660
BUT YOU GOT TO CHILL,
ALL RIGHT? AT LEAST SIT DOWN.

01:26.660 --> 01:29.040
BRO, I HAD THIS MAN
SET UP AND ARRESTED.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.840
THERE'S NO WAY TYRONE
GONNA LET THIS SLIDE.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.380
NOBODY LETTING NOTHING
HAPPEN TO YOU, ALL RIGHT?

01:33.380 --> 01:35.670
FOR HOW LONG? I CAN'T
JUST KEEP LIVING MY LIFE
LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.150
YO, DID I MISS
SOMETHING?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.320
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY
DAMN SURE SHOOTING
SOMEBODY 4 TIMES

01:58.320 --> 02:00.780
AT POINTBLANK RANGE
EQUALS A HALF
LIFE SENTENCE.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.120
IT IS, BUT I AIN'T
NO SNITCH.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.740
YOU REFUSED
TO TESTIFY?

02:03.740 --> 02:05.330
THEN THEY DROPPED
THE CHARGES AGAINST TYRONE.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.700
LOOK, I'LL HANDLE
TYRONE IN THE STREETS.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.750
COOP: OH,
I RISKED MY LIFE

02:08.750 --> 02:10.630
FOR YOU AND
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD TO
HAVE HIS ASS PUT AWAY.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.130
WHY NOT
KEEP HIM LOCKED UP?

02:12.130 --> 02:13.750
'CAUSE THAT AIN'T
HOW I OPERATE.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.880
SPENCER: THIS AIN'T JUST
ABOUT YOU, MAN.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.840
I'VE BEEN OUT ON
THESE STREETS TOO DAMN LONG

02:17.840 --> 02:20.430
TO LET SOME
TEENAGERS TELL ME
HOW TO HANDLE BUSINESS.

02:20.430 --> 02:23.430
I JUST CAME HERE TO TELL
YOU THAT YOU AIN'T GOT
TO WORRY ABOUT TYRONE.

02:23.430 --> 02:25.220
COOP: EASY FOR YOU
TO SAY.

02:25.220 --> 02:26.390
YOU AIN'T THE ONE
THAT HAD HIS ASS
PUT AWAY.

02:26.390 --> 02:27.770
WE CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING.

02:27.770 --> 02:30.810
AS LONG AS YOU
STAY ALIVE, SO DOES HE.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.190
HE BREAKS THAT DEAL,

MAKING AN APPEARANCE

04:00.900 --> 04:02.860
IN THESE BEVERLY HILLS
STREETS?

04:02.860 --> 04:04.110
HA HA! WHAT'S UP, MA?

04:04.110 --> 04:05.660
YOU TELL ME.

04:05.660 --> 04:07.870
I CAN BARELY GET YOU
ON THE PHONE LATELY,

04:07.870 --> 04:09.910
SO I FIGURED I'D STOP BY.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.500
YOU GOT TIME TO GRAB
A BITE AND CATCH UP?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.410
OF COURSE. BUT CAN WE
GET IT TO GO?

04:13.410 --> 04:15.000
I GOT TO WALK MY
NEIGHBOR'S DOG
IN AN HOUR.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.750
SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME A DOG WALKER?

04:16.750 --> 04:19.420
THE MOMENT SHE TOLD ME
IT WAS $50 PER DOG.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.840
LOOK, ME QUITTING
FOOTBALL WAS
A GAME CHANGER.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.630
I GOT TO FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO PAY
FOR COLLEGE NOW,

04:23.630 --> 04:25.640
SO I GOT A FEW
EXTRA SHIFTS HERE

04:25.640 --> 04:27.640
AND SOME SIDE HUSTLES
GOING.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.060
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN
THAT TO PAY FOR COLLEGE, SON.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.930
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

04:32.930 --> 04:34.440
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
I COULD FIGURE OUT

04:34.440 --> 04:36.230
THE COLLEGE THING
ON MY OWN.

04:36.230 --> 04:38.060
YOU ALREADY GOT ME
AND DILLON
TO TAKE CARE OF,

04:38.060 --> 04:39.730
NOT TO MENTION
DARNELL JUST MOVED IN.

04:39.730 --> 04:41.730
BARE MINIMUM,
LET ME HELP YOU.

04:41.730 --> 04:43.280
YOU SOUND LIKE DILLON.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.740
HE JUST WON A CASH AWARD
FOR TOP MATHLETE.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.070
HE INSISTED THAT I
KEEP IT.

04:47.070 --> 04:49.950
HEY, THAT'S WHAT'S UP!
A MATHLETE?

04:49.950 --> 04:51.870
-MM-HMM.
-WOW.

04:51.870 --> 04:53.660
VAN NESS CHARTER'S
CHANGED A WHOLE LOT
SINCE I WENT THERE.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.920
HE WON THE AWARD AT
BIG BROTHER'S CAMP.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.580
I ENROLLED HIM LAST MONTH.

04:57.580 --> 04:58.920
BUT HE ALREADY HAS
A BIG BROTHER.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.960
WHY NOT COME TO ME?

05:00.960 --> 05:03.920
BETWEEN SCHOOL AND WORK,
YOU GOT A LOT GOING ON,
SPENCER.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.880
YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.680
THIS WAS MORE ABOUT
MISSING COREY.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.850
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU, OK?

05:13.100 --> 05:15.480
HEY, THERE THEY ARE.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.060
WOW. HE SEEMS
CHIPPER.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.900
LIKE, MORE THAN "WE JUST WON
A GAME CHIPPER."

05:18.900 --> 05:19.900
OLIVIA: YEAH,
SHOULD WE BE
CONCERNED?

05:19.900 --> 05:21.730
100%.

05:21.730 --> 05:22.900
YOU TWO DO KNOW
THAT I CAN HEAR YOU, RIGHT?

05:22.900 --> 05:24.900
GET OVER HERE. COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.900
COME ON.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.910
WAIT. IS THIS
ABOUT MOM?

05:28.910 --> 05:30.410
IS SHE NOT VISITING
AUNT NAOMI BACK EAST?

05:30.410 --> 05:31.620
NOPE. SHE IS.

05:31.620 --> 05:32.990
WAIT. SO DID
YOU GUYS DECIDE

05:32.990 --> 05:35.160
TO CALL OFF
THE SEPARATION
OR SOMETHING?

05:35.160 --> 05:37.040
NO. WE HAVEN'T. LOOK, WHY
DON'T YOU GUYS STOP
TRYING TO GUESS

05:37.040 --> 05:38.080
AND JUST LET ME HAVE MY TURN?
CAN I SPEAK, PLEASE?

05:38.080 --> 05:40.290
-SORRY.
-ALL RIGHT.

05:40.290 --> 05:42.630
NOW, IF THERE'S ONE
THING THAT I LEARNED
FROM FAMILY THERAPY,

05:42.630 --> 05:45.130
IT'S THAT WE NEED TO CREATE
SOME NEW MEMORIES,

05:45.130 --> 05:47.090
SO SINCE I HAVE YOU BOTH
TO MYSELF THIS WEEKEND,

05:47.090 --> 05:48.840
I THOUGHT WE'D START TODAY.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.430
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE,
DINNER AFTERWARDS?

05:50.430 --> 05:52.430
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:52.430 --> 05:54.060
UM, YEAH, SORRY,
DAD. I GOT TO TAKE
A RAIN CHECK.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.640
I ALREADY MADE
PLANS WITH ASHER.

05:55.640 --> 05:56.930
BUT NEXT TIME
FOR SURE.

05:56.930 --> 05:58.850
OK. HAVE FUN.

05:58.850 --> 06:01.860
ASHER? ARE THEY
A THING?

06:01.860 --> 06:04.980
OH, YEAH. PET NAMES,
PDA, HEART EMOJIS.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.780
IT'S GROSS.

06:06.780 --> 06:09.320
HUH. OK.
WELL, I GUESS THAT
LEAVES YOU AND ME.

06:09.320 --> 06:12.660
RIGHT. AH, I'M,
UH, SORRY. SORRY.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.790
I'M ACTUALLY HELPING JJ
MENTOR YOUNG KIDS TODAY

06:14.790 --> 06:16.160
AT HIS CHURCH, SO...

06:16.160 --> 06:17.870
JJ GOES TO CHURCH?
OUR JJ?

06:17.870 --> 06:19.370
YEAH. HE'S A YOUTH LEADER.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.170
HUH. THOSE POOR KIDS.

06:21.170 --> 06:23.420
I MEAN, UH,
GOD BLESS HIM.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.420
RIGHT. UM, I GOT YOU
ON THE NEXT ONE, THOUGH.

06:25.420 --> 06:27.760
-YEAH, MAN.
-ALL RIGHT? COOL.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.470
BUGGS: I'M TELLING Y'ALL,

06:41.270 --> 06:43.020
IT'S GONNA BE LIT.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.360
EXCUSE ME.

06:51.910 --> 06:52.910

06:52.910 --> 06:53.990

OH. I SAW YOUR LAST VIDEO
DISSING OL' BOY.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.500
I'M BUGGS.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.040
NOW, YOU ALL GOT TO HAVE
ROOM FOR ANOTHER ARTIST.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.050
I PROMISE YOU, I'LL

LOOK, I'M THE HEAD
PROMOTER OF THE EVENT.

07:11.630 --> 07:13.430
I GOT ONE MORE SLOT
TO FILL,

07:13.430 --> 07:14.800
IF YOU CAN PULL
YOUR WEIGHT.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.060
YOU BET.
WHAT DO I GOT TO DO?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.220
I GOT 40 OF THESE
TICKETS LEFT TO SELL.

07:18.220 --> 07:21.600
IF YOU CAN GET THEM OFF, I'LL
SQUEEZE YOU IN THAT SLOT.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.730

07:23.730 --> 07:25.690
IF THERE'S ANYTHING

07:25.690 --> 07:28.150

07:28.150 --> 07:29.820
WHAT THEY COME WITH,
A CHAUFFEUR SERVICE?

07:29.820 --> 07:31.400
IT INCLUDES
ADMISSION, SKATES,

07:31.400 --> 07:34.120
AND AN INTIMATE CONCERT

THAT FLYER.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.140
I NEED THE MONEY IN
24 HOURS, OR IT'S A WRAP.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.470
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.060
MAKING NEW FRIENDS, COOP?

08:00.060 --> 08:01.770
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.780
ONE TIME FOR
THE MATHLETE CHAMP.

08:11.780 --> 08:13.150
CONGRATULATIONS, D.

08:13.150 --> 08:15.200
THANKS.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.990
YOU BEEN GETTING

I'VE BEEN BLOWING YOU UP.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.740
I FIGURED I'D DO WHAT YOU
BEEN DOING TO ME LATELY--

08:18.740 --> 08:20.790
TAKE 2 HOURS
TO HIT YOU BACK.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.540
I'M SORRY, MAN.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.790
I'VE BEEN WORKING LIKE
CRAZY TRYING TO STACK
MONEY FOR COLLEGE.

08:28.790 --> 08:30.960
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
TO CHECK MY PHONE.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.800
HEY, LOOK, BUT I'M HERE
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

08:32.800 --> 08:34.180
SO LET'S CELEBRATE.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.890
YOU WANT TO HIT UP
YOUR FAVORITE ARCADE?

08:35.890 --> 08:37.930
NOT WITH YOU.

08:37.930 --> 08:39.310
GRACE: OK, THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:39.310 --> 08:42.890
TAKE THOSE HEADPHONES
OFF, PLEASE, NOW.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.150
GRACE: I'M NOT A FAN OF THIS
LITTLE ATTITUDE OF YOURS.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.270
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

08:50.270 --> 08:52.110
NO.

08:52.110 --> 08:53.360
SPENCER: LOOK, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK
TO US, RIGHT?

08:53.360 --> 08:55.150
AND IT CAN BE ABOUT
ANYTHING.

08:55.150 --> 08:57.910
JAYSTONIANS,
DARNELL MOVING IN,
DAD BEING GONE.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.740
NO MATTER WHAT, ME
AND MOMS IS HERE FOR YOU.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.620
YOU MEAN MOMS IS HERE
FOR ME, RIGHT?

09:01.620 --> 09:04.120
BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER
HERE ANYMORE.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.170
BUT IT'S COOL.
I GOT A MENTOR NOW.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.000
I DON'T NEED YOU.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.210
FEEL FREE TO STAY
IN BEVERLY HILLS.

09:18.060 --> 09:19.400
LAYLA: THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT PERFECTION.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.150
EVERYONE HAS THEIR
OWN IDEA OF IT.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.950
MY CLASSMATES WANTED
THE PERFECT StuCo PRESIDENT.

09:25.950 --> 09:29.030
THE COLLEGES
WANT THE PERFECT STUDENT.

09:29.030 --> 09:34.040
AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO BE
THE PERFECT DAUGHTER,

09:34.040 --> 09:35.830
THE PERFECT
GIRLFRIEND--

09:35.830 --> 09:37.580
WHY THE NEED TO
BE PERFECT?

09:37.580 --> 09:39.040
EVERYONE THOUGHT I WAS,

09:39.040 --> 09:42.800
SO I JUST CONVINCED
MYSELF IT WAS TRUE.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.260
THAT'S THE WORST PART
ABOUT PERFECTION,

09:44.260 --> 09:46.840
IS DISAPPOINTING YOURSELF
'CAUSE YOU'RE

09:46.840 --> 09:49.470
THE ONE PERSON
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE.

09:49.470 --> 09:51.600
AND WHEN I REALIZED
I WASN'T PERFECT,

09:51.600 --> 09:53.970
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
MOTIVATED

09:53.970 --> 09:56.020
TO DO ANYTHING ANYMORE.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.890
FEAR OF LETTING
PEOPLE DOWN?

09:57.890 --> 10:00.020
FEAR OF NOT
BEING ENOUGH.

10:00.020 --> 10:02.020
OK. WHAT ELSE?

10:02.020 --> 10:04.780
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT ELSE?

10:04.780 --> 10:06.990
LOOK, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF PEER GROUP.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.860
THERE'S NO DOCTORS.
IT'S JUST US.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.080
SHARE SOMETHING YOU'VE
NEVER SHARED BEFORE.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.370
IT'LL HELP WITH WHATEVER'S
WEIGHING YOU DOWN.

10:22.090 --> 10:27.510
I, UM, I DON'T THINK
THE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

10:27.510 --> 10:30.510
LOVE ME ENOUGH TO STAY.

10:32.100 --> 10:37.180
MY MOM DIED, AND WAS
IT AN ACCIDENT?

10:37.180 --> 10:41.190
OR DID SHE GIVE UP
ON HERSELF OR ME?

10:41.190 --> 10:44.230
WAS I NOT WORTH LIVING
FOR? I DON'T KNOW.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.610
AND THEN MY DAD LEFT.

10:46.610 --> 10:49.280
AND WHEN OUR HOUSE
WAS BROKEN INTO,

10:49.280 --> 10:52.200
A HOUSE HE LEFT ME
TO LIVE IN ALONE,

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
HE STILL DIDN'T
COME BACK.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.120
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
HE'S HERE NOW,
AND HE'S TRYING.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.130
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S
MORE OUT OF GUILT

11:02.130 --> 11:04.210
THAN OUT OF LOVE.

11:04.210 --> 11:09.510
THANKS FOR TRUSTING US
WITH SOMETHING
SO PERSONAL, LAYLA.

11:09.510 --> 11:12.300
MAJOR GROWTH MOMENT.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.060
SPENCER: NO, FOR REAL,

11:18.060 --> 11:19.980
THE WAY DILLON SNAPPED
AT ME REMINDED ME

11:19.980 --> 11:21.520
OF MYSELF WHEN COREY LEFT.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.770
I MEAN, MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.480
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BE A GOOD BROTHER
TO HIM NO MORE,

11:26.480 --> 11:29.110
NOT TO MENTION HELP HIM
THROUGH THIS CRISIS.

11:29.110 --> 11:32.160
HEY, WHEN WAS THE LAST
TIME DILLON HAD A WHUPPING?

11:35.280 --> 11:37.450
LISTEN, MAN, HAVE YOU
BEEN A LITTLE BUSY LATELY?

11:37.450 --> 11:42.000
MAYBE. BUT CAN'T
NOBODY DENY YOUR LOVE
FOR LITTLE MAN.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.370
AND THE WAY I
SEE IT, HE'LL COME
AROUND EVENTUALLY.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.000
HE'S STILL A KID.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.500
HE'S JUST TRYING TO
NAVIGATE HIS WAY

11:46.500 --> 11:48.300
THROUGH THE CHANGES
THAT HAPPEN IN HIS LIFE.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.470
SPEAKING OF CHANGES...

11:50.470 --> 11:52.970
WHAT?

11:52.970 --> 11:55.760
MAN, YOU BETTER NOT TELL ME
YOU MESSED THINGS UP
WITH PATIENCE AGAIN.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.470
MAN, HELL, NO.

11:57.470 --> 12:00.770
I GOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO
PERFORM AT BELLA NOCHE.

12:00.770 --> 12:02.190
-WHAT?!
-YEAH.

12:02.190 --> 12:03.770
YOU SHOULD'VE LED
WITH THAT, FOOL.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.690
BUT I GOT TO SELL
40 TICKETS.

12:05.690 --> 12:07.320
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S NOTHING.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.240
-THEY $100 EACH.
-DAMN. HEH! OK.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.200
I MEAN, LOOK, THAT'S
STEEP, BUT I THINK WE
CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.330
WHAT'S THE PART YOU'RE
NOT TELLING ME?

12:17.330 --> 12:18.700
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.120
IT'S LIKE, EVER SINCE
HE GOT OUT,

12:21.120 --> 12:23.370
TYRONE HAS BEEN
RANDOMLY POPPING UP

12:23.370 --> 12:25.000
EVERYWHERE I'M AT.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.210
LIKE TODAY AT
THE SLAUSON CAFE.

12:28.210 --> 12:31.050
IT'S GOT ME FEELING LIKE
I SHOULD LAY LOW

12:31.050 --> 12:33.220
AND MAYBE EVEN GIVE
THIS DUDE
BACK HIS TICKETS.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.550
-WHY? WHAT DID TY DO?
-NOTHING YET.

12:35.550 --> 12:38.850
IT JUST FEELS LIKE,
"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID
LAST SUMMER" TYPE VIBE.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.310
AND I DON'T LIKE THAT.

12:40.310 --> 12:42.390
LOOK, TYRONE MADE
A DEAL WITH PREACH, RIGHT?

12:42.390 --> 12:43.810
HE AIN'T TRYING TO DIE.

12:43.810 --> 12:45.270
HE'S JUST TRYING TO
INTIMIDATE YOU.

12:45.270 --> 12:46.600
YOU GOOD, COOP.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.400
AND THIS GIG IS
A DREAM OPPORTUNITY.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.020
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON
MOVING FORWARD

12:50.020 --> 12:51.610
WITH YOUR LIFE.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.150
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO
BORE YOU

12:55.150 --> 12:56.950
WITH ALL THE UPDATES
ON EVERYONE'S LIVES
ON THE OUTSIDE.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.370
NO, LIV, I WANT TO HEAR,
I PROMISE.

12:59.370 --> 13:03.000
UM, HOW'S--
HOW'S SPENCER?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
UH, I'M A LITTLE
CONCERNED.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.460
UH-OH. DETECTIVE LIV
ON THE LOOSE.

13:08.460 --> 13:10.670
YOU GONNA SHAVE YOUR HEAD
AND PRETEND TO BE HIM, TOO?

13:12.260 --> 13:14.420
I'M KIDDING.

13:14.420 --> 13:18.760
I--NO. SPENCER'S
JUST BEEN WORKING
OVERTIME LIKE CRAZY.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.180
I'M WORRIED HE'S
BURYING HIS FEELINGS
ABOUT QUITTING FOOTBALL.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.310
WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WORK IS HIS WAY
OF FINDING HIMSELF.

13:26.310 --> 13:28.770
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

13:28.770 --> 13:32.320
BUT, ANYWAY, UM, YEAH,
EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOOD.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.900
EVERYONE'S JUST
REALLY MISSING YOU
ON THE OUTSIDE.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.240
COULD YOU MAYBE STOP
SAYING "THE OUTSIDE"
LIKE I'M IN A PRISON?

13:38.240 --> 13:39.240
YEAH.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.200
SORRY.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.700
I MISSED YOU.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.660
I MISSED YOU, TOO.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.290
YOU SEEM REALLY AMAZING.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.040
WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

13:48.040 --> 13:50.590
UM, WE'LL SEE.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.210
LAYLA, I THOUGHT YOU
SAID THEY CLEARED YOU
FOR OFF-CAMPUS VISITS,

13:53.210 --> 13:55.090
BUT THIS IS
THE SECOND TIME

13:55.090 --> 13:56.920
YOU HAD ME COME HERE
INSTEAD.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.300
IS EVERYTHING OK?

13:58.300 --> 14:01.430
YEAH. TOTALLY. UM,
IT'S JUST EASIER.

14:01.430 --> 14:04.060
UH, ANYWAY,
I GOT TO GET GOING,
BUT I'LL SEE YOU SOON?

14:04.060 --> 14:05.680
YEAH.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.230
THANKS FOR COMING.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.320
OLIVIA: HEY, I JUST
GOT YOUR TEXT.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.400
COOP'S HAVING A CONCERT
TOMORROW NIGHT?

14:17.400 --> 14:20.450
YEAH, IF WE CAN HELP
SELL OUR SHARE OF
THE TICKETS IN TIME.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.870
FIGURE WE CAN GO
DOOR TO DOOR IN MY
NEIGHBORHOOD,

14:22.870 --> 14:24.910
SPLIT THE TICKETS BETWEEN
ME, YOU TWO, AND DILLON.

14:24.910 --> 14:26.830
YEAH. YEAH. I'M GAME.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.460
I MEAN, I'LL ALREADY

COMMUNITY WORK

14:28.460 --> 14:30.120
WITH KIA FOR SoLA MUSE.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.960
AND ASHER'S MEETING
ME AFTERWARDS.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.340
SO MAYBE THEY CAN
TAG ALONG AS WELL?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.710
YEAH, BET.

14:34.710 --> 14:36.130
I FIGURE THE MORE
PEOPLE WE HAVE,

14:36.130 --> 14:37.630
THE FASTER WE CAN SELL
THOSE TICKETS.

14:37.630 --> 14:39.680
BILLY: TICKETS TO WHAT?

14:39.680 --> 14:42.390
COOP'S PERFORMING AT
BELLA NOCHE SKATING RINK
TOMORROW NIGHT.

14:42.390 --> 14:43.850

14:43.850 --> 14:45.890
MM-HMM.

14:45.890 --> 14:47.680
BILLY: YO, THAT USED TO BE
MY SPOT BACK IN THE DAY.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.400
I HAD THESE TEAL BLUE
ROLLER SKATES,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.900
HAMMER PANTS,
GUMBY HAIRCUT.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.940
YOU COULDN'T TELL ME
NOTHING. MM.

14:54.940 --> 14:58.530
THEN SKEE-LO's "I WISH"
WOULD COME ON.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.740
MY SKATE MOVES WERE
SECOND TO NONE, BABY.

15:01.740 --> 15:06.330
OHH, HA, UH. CROSS IT
OVER. CROSS IT OVER.

15:06.330 --> 15:09.290
YOU HAD WHOSE PANTS?

15:09.290 --> 15:10.580

IS A GUMBY?

15:10.580 --> 15:12.000
BILLY: YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.920
WE SHOULD GO
ROLLER-SKATING TOMORROW.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.460
MY SKATES ARE AT
MY POP'S HOUSE.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.300
I'LL SWING BY,
PICK THEM UP.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.420
FOUR TICKETS, PLEASE,
SPENCER.

15:19.420 --> 15:21.930
SHOOT. IF YOU COULDN'T GO

15:21.930 --> 15:23.510
WHERE ELSE COULD YOU GO?

15:23.510 --> 15:25.600
HA HA!

15:25.600 --> 15:29.730
YO, TWO LEFT. THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

15:29.730 --> 15:31.980
I'LL SEE YOU ALL TONIGHT.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.730
WHAT THE HELL

15:33.730 --> 15:35.440
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?
I'M SELLING TICKETS.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.690
FOR WHAT?

15:36.690 --> 15:38.780
FOR A CONCERT TONIGHT
AT BELLA NOCHE.

15:38.780 --> 15:40.400
ONE OF THE PROMOTES
IS GIVING ME A SLOT TO
PERFORM AS AN OPENING ACT

15:40.400 --> 15:41.740
FOR BIG VIPER
AND SLIM ROMAN--

15:41.740 --> 15:43.110
-IF I CAN SELL--
-WHO?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.490
YOU'RE NOT HEARING
WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:44.490 --> 15:46.490
-WHAT PROMOTER?
-HIS NAME IS BUGGS.

15:46.490 --> 15:48.120
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HIM? HE LEGIT?

15:48.120 --> 15:49.370
LOOK WHO WANT
TO PROTECT ME NOW.

15:49.370 --> 15:51.000
YOU CAN'T BE GETTING
CAUGHT UP WITH FOLKS

15:51.000 --> 15:52.750
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
FROM A CAN OF PAINT.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.540
LISTEN, WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS GO ON ABOUT MY BUSINESS,

15:55.540 --> 15:57.500
SELLING THESE TICKETS,
AND YOU GO ON ABOUT YOURS,

15:57.500 --> 15:59.630
LETTING KNOWN KILLERS
ROAM THE STREET.

16:13.060 --> 16:16.060
SO HOW WAS YOUR VISIT
WITH LAYLA?

16:16.060 --> 16:19.230
GOOD. FINE.

16:19.230 --> 16:21.110
THAT BAD, HUH?

16:21.110 --> 16:24.070
SHE FLIP OUT WHEN SHE
FOUND OUT ABOUT YOU
AND ASHER OR WHAT?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.070
I KIND OF DIDN'T TELL HER.

16:26.070 --> 16:30.040
SHE'D DOING GREAT BUT
STILL SEEMS HESITANT
ABOUT HER RECOVERY,

16:30.040 --> 16:32.710
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.960
WELL, ISN'T TRANSPARENCY
PART OF RECOVERY?

16:34.960 --> 16:37.840
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD JUST BE
HONEST WITH HER AND TELL
HER THE TRUTH, LIV.

16:39.550 --> 16:41.050
DO I REALLY HAVE TO GO?

16:41.050 --> 16:43.550
YEAH, MAN. COOP
IS DEPENDING ON US.

16:43.550 --> 16:45.340
AND IT'LL GIVE ME
AND YOU A CHANCE
TO HANG OUT.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.300
YOU CAN FINALLY TELL
ME WHAT'S REALLY
BOTHERING YOU.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.050
AIN'T NOTHING
BOTHERING ME.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.060
I USED TO SAY
THE SAME THING, DILLON.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.180
WOW. I LOVE
HOW YOU QUIT FOOTBALL

16:53.180 --> 16:54.980
AND EVERYBODY'S FINE WITH IT.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.940
BUT AS SOON AS I SPEAK
SOMETHING FROM MY OPINION

16:57.940 --> 17:00.150
ABOUT ANYTHING,
I'M A PROBLEM.

17:07.530 --> 17:09.160
-HEY, BABE.
-HEY.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.950
ALL RIGHT.
THE SQUAD'S ALL HERE.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.750
WE APPRECIATE
YOU, MAN.

17:12.750 --> 17:16.330
ASHER: YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

17:16.330 --> 17:18.000
KIA: DIVIDE
AND CONQUER.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.920
NOPE. NOPE. MM-MM. NOPE.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.010
NOT PLAYING THE THIRD
WHEEL TO THE ASHER-LIV
REALITY SHOW TODAY. SORRY.

17:23.010 --> 17:25.010
SPENCER: DON'T EVEN
LISTEN TO HIM, ASH,
ALL RIGHT?

17:25.010 --> 17:27.090
YOU CAN ROLL WITH
ME AND DILLON.

17:27.090 --> 17:29.220
SO YOU AND OLIVIA ARE
A THING NOW, RIGHT?

17:29.220 --> 17:30.930
LIKE FOR REAL,
FOR REAL?

17:30.930 --> 17:32.310
ASHER: YEAH.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.770
YOU BETTER TREAT
HER RIGHT

17:33.770 --> 17:35.230
BECAUSE AS SOON
AS I TURN 18,

17:35.230 --> 17:37.390
SHE'LL BE THE FIRST
PERSON I CALL.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.150
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A FIGHT ON
YOUR HANDS, THOUGH.

17:39.150 --> 17:40.610
-OK. ALL RIGHT...
-ALL RIGHT.

17:40.610 --> 17:42.020
ASHER: IF YOU'RE COOL
WITH THAT, MAN.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.980
-OH, YEAH, I'M COOL.
-HA HA!

17:43.980 --> 17:45.940
WOMAN: YOU WERE ON FIRE
IN PEER GROUP TODAY.

17:45.940 --> 17:50.740
THAT'S TWO DAYS IN A ROW.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

17:50.740 --> 17:53.450
WELL, IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
3 WEEKS AGO THAT I

17:53.450 --> 17:58.210
WOULD BE SPILLING
MY GUTS TO A ROOM OF
COMPLETE STRANGERS,

17:58.210 --> 18:00.040
I WOULD'VE TOLD YOU
YOU WERE LYING.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.590
HONESTLY, YOU
SURPRISED ME, TOO.

18:03.590 --> 18:06.550
I DIDN'T KNOW
IF YOU'D OPEN UP.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.800
WHAT MADE YOU PUSH?

18:08.800 --> 18:12.050
I SEE A LOT OF
MYSELF IN YOU.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.970
I JUST WENT WITH MY GUT.

18:13.970 --> 18:16.100
I FELT LIKE THERE WAS
MORE THERE.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.690
I HAVE A CONFESSION.

18:23.690 --> 18:27.820
MY TREATMENT
PROGRAM'S DONE.

18:27.820 --> 18:30.450
I'M LEAVING TOMORROW.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.200
UM, I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.370
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING SOONER

18:38.370 --> 18:41.170
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU AND STALL
YOUR PROGRESS.

18:41.170 --> 18:43.670
IT JUST WON'T BE
THE SAME WITHOUT YOU.

18:43.670 --> 18:48.380
LAYLA, YOU'RE DOING
AWESOME.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.180
ARE YOU READY TO
GO BACK OUT INTO
THE REAL WORLD?

18:53.180 --> 18:55.510
AREN'T YOU NERVOUS?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.020
OF COURSE.

18:58.020 --> 19:02.100
WHEN YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOR SO LONG,

19:02.100 --> 19:03.940
IT FEELS WEIRD
GOING BACK.

19:03.940 --> 19:09.240

19:13.490 --> 19:15.030
COOP: ALL RIGHT, DILLON.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.120
WE GOT ONE MORE
TICKET TO SELL,

19:17.120 --> 19:19.450

19:23.830 --> 19:25.840
HEY, MAN, IS IT
JUST ME,

19:25.840 --> 19:28.260
OR ARE THINGS
A LITTLE TENSE BETWEEN
YOU AND DILLON?

19:28.260 --> 19:30.340
NAH, IT AIN'T JUST YOU, MAN.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.260
EVER SINCE I QUIT FOOTBALL
AND BEEN WORKING OVERTIME,

19:33.260 --> 19:35.970
I AIN'T BEEN AROUND
AS MUCH.

19:35.970 --> 19:38.100
DILLON'S KIND OF
STRUGGLING WITH THAT.

19:40.060 --> 19:43.190
YOU MISS IT? FOOTBALL?

19:43.190 --> 19:44.690
PSSH. MAN, I
CAN'T EVEN FRONT.

19:44.690 --> 19:47.150
THERE'S PARTS OF IT
I DO MISS.

19:47.150 --> 19:49.780
HANGING IN THE LOCKER ROOM

23:22.950 --> 23:24.570
MAY I ASK WHY?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.370
OFFICER: ACCORDING TO
THE OWNER OF BUNCH-O's,

23:26.370 --> 23:27.660
A PERSON FITTING
YOUR DESCRIPTION
WAS LOITERING

23:27.660 --> 23:28.660
AND CAUSING
DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

23:28.660 --> 23:30.500
LOITERING?

23:30.500 --> 23:32.790
KIA: YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION, SPENCE.

23:32.790 --> 23:35.290
I'VE ALREADY COMMITTED
THEIR NAMES AND BADGE
NUMBERS TO MEMORY.

23:35.290 --> 23:38.460
OFFICERS BRIGHT
AND WHITNER.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.510
WHITNER: A LOT OF GANGS
CONGREGATE IN THIS AREA.

23:42.510 --> 23:44.390
ARE YOU IN ONE?

23:46.010 --> 23:49.350
SPENCER: GO STAND NEXT
TO JORDAN, DILLON. GO ON.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.560
LOOK, THE OWNER STRAIGHT
PROFILED US, OK?

23:55.560 --> 23:57.360
WE DIDN'T DO NOTHING WRONG.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.360
BUT YOU DID GET INTO
A FIGHT IN THE STORE.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.240
AN ARGUMENT WITH MY
LITTLE BROTHER. DOESN'T
MEAN I'M IN A GANG.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.700
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU AREN'T.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.490
-CAN WE GO NOW?
-HEY, WATCH YOUR TONE.

24:06.410 --> 24:08.330
THIS IS UNNECESSARY,
OFFICER.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.950
STEP ASIDE, SON.
THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

24:10.950 --> 24:16.210
NOW, I'M GONNA ASK YOU ONE
MORE TIME. WHERE'S YOUR I.D.?

24:19.340 --> 24:21.380

ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.230
YOUR PARTNER ALMOST
PULLED A GUN OUT ON US!

24:41.230 --> 24:43.240
WE EITHER FINISH THIS
HERE, OR WE TAKE THIS
TO THE POLICE STATION.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.740
LOOK, MAN, CAN YOU
PLEASE LET MY FRIENDS

24:50.740 --> 24:52.160
TAKE MY LITTLE
BROTHER HOME?

24:52.160 --> 24:53.870
HE DON'T NEED TO BE
SEEING ALL THIS.

24:53.870 --> 24:55.420
EVERYBODY IS
STAYING PUT.

24:55.420 --> 24:57.210
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
READ US OUR RIGHTS?

24:57.210 --> 24:58.750
WHITNER: 'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT IN CUSTODY.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.500
EXACTLY, WHICH SHOULD
MAKE US FREE TO GO.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.760
ARE SPENCER AND KIA
GOING TO JAIL?

25:02.760 --> 25:05.470
ASHER: NO, NO, BUDDY.
THEY'RE JUST ASKING
THEM SOME QUESTIONS.

25:05.470 --> 25:08.470
JORDAN: THIS IS
ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

25:08.470 --> 25:10.810
OLIVIA: THOSE ARE
MY FRIENDS ON THE CURB.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.640
YOU COULD STOP THIS,
YOU KNOW?

25:14.560 --> 25:17.400
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

25:17.400 --> 25:20.820
-REGGIE BRIGHT.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.450
NOBODY'S BEING
RACIALLY PROFILED.

25:32.450 --> 25:33.830
WE'RE JUST ANSWERING A CALL.

25:33.830 --> 25:36.670
YEAH, I KNOW.
MY DAUGHTER TEXTED ME.

25:36.670 --> 25:38.540
LOOK, YOU KNOW
THESE KIDS ARE GOOD.

25:38.540 --> 25:40.040
THEY DIDN'T DO
NOTHING WRONG.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.090
BRIGHT: WE'RE JUST BEING
EXTRA CAUTIOUS.

25:42.090 --> 25:44.050
KIDS HAVE CHANGED AROUND
HERE SINCE YOU ESCAPED
TO BEVERLY HILLS.

25:44.050 --> 25:48.430

OK, LOOK HERE.

25:48.430 --> 25:50.930
YOU CAN EITHER RELEASE
THESE KIDS IMMEDIATELY,

25:50.930 --> 25:54.430
OR MY WIFE AND I WILL

ENTIRE DEPARTMENT,

AND THEN WE'LL MAKE
SURE BOTH YOUR ASSES
ARE STUCK BEHIND A DESK

26:33.290 --> 26:35.080

26:54.480 --> 26:56.600
HE'S STILL A LITTLE
BIT SHAKEN UP,

26:56.600 --> 26:59.650
A GOOD, NICE REST
SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.440
I'M SORRY, MA.

27:01.440 --> 27:03.610
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE DILLON
FEEL BETTER.

27:03.610 --> 27:05.400
INSTEAD, I MADE
EVERYTHING WORSE.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.610
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE
THAT NEEDS TO BE SORRY.

27:07.610 --> 27:10.200
WAIT TILL I GET

27:17.670 --> 27:19.500
MM-HMM. HE STILL IS.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.630
-I'M GONNA CHECK ON DILLON.
-NO, NO, NO, NO. I GOT IT.

31:50.150 --> 31:51.990
THEY WOULD MAKE YOU STAY
IN REHAB LONGER.

31:51.990 --> 31:54.450

THEY CAUGHT YOU.

BUT OUT IN THE REAL WORLD,
THERE'S NO GUARANTEES.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.940

32:24.940 --> 32:27.400

SABOTAGED YOURSELF

32:27.400 --> 32:30.110

32:30.110 --> 32:33.910

I HAVE DECIDED

32:33.910 --> 32:35.700

TOMORROW.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.080

IT IN THE REAL WORLD.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.710

32:43.710 --> 32:46.710
NO. BUT LIKE MY
THERAPIST SAYS,

32:46.710 --> 32:49.960
YOU ARE NEVER FULLY
PREPARED FOR ANYTHING.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.300
YOU JUST HAVE TO TAKE
A LEAP OF FAITH

32:52.300 --> 32:55.220
AND REMEMBER THAT
HEALING IS CONSTANT.

32:55.220 --> 32:57.430
YOU KNOW,
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

32:59.970 --> 33:03.310
AND WHENEVER YOU'RE
READY TO MAKE THAT STEP,

33:03.310 --> 33:07.150
JUST KNOW YOU HAVE
A FRIEND ON THE OUTSIDE.

33:07.150 --> 33:08.230
OK?

33:12.570 --> 33:15.160

33:15.160 --> 33:17.160

33:17.160 --> 33:19.200
YEAH. SHE SAID
SHE'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.790

MY BACK WITH THE COPS

33:31.170 --> 33:33.800

MORE TIME WITH HIM,

AND SCHOOL,

33:36.180 --> 33:38.180
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH
HOURS IN THE DAY.

33:38.180 --> 33:40.970

33:40.970 --> 33:43.020

"THE GREAT
DEBATERS," RIGHT?

33:43.020 --> 33:44.390

33:44.390 --> 33:46.560
AT LEAST A THOUSAND TIMES.

33:46.560 --> 33:48.810
OK. IT'S ONE OF THE
MAIN REASONS I JOINED
THE DEBATE CLUB.

33:48.810 --> 33:51.230
-YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
-UNCLE FLIP IS THE OTHER.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.150

33:53.150 --> 33:55.200

33:55.200 --> 33:57.110
BEFORE HE SERVED TIME,
HE TAUGHT ME THE ART
OF DEBATING.

33:57.110 --> 34:00.200
AND REAL TALK,
HE'S THE BEST COACH
I'VE EVER HAD.

34:00.200 --> 34:01.990
DAMN.

34:01.990 --> 34:05.790
THAT TIME TOGETHER
REALLY BONDED
ME AND HIM FOR LIFE.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.750

34:10.750 --> 34:13.300

34:37.990 --> 34:40.370
YEAH.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.030
I MISS THIS.

35:03.220 --> 35:05.810
NOBODY'S HOME FOR
A FEW HOURS.

35:24.910 --> 35:26.200
WHAT'S UP, PREACH?

35:26.200 --> 35:29.660
YOU WAS RIGHT.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.210

ROLL WITH ME THROUGH THERE?

35:39.010 --> 35:40.800

35:40.800 --> 35:42.640

TRIED TO WARN YOU

35:42.640 --> 35:44.930

36:18.710 --> 36:21.380

SAID YESTERDAY.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.850
THERE'S
POWER IN MEMORIES.

36:31.850 --> 36:34.100
ESPECIALLY THE GOOD ONES.

36:36.190 --> 36:37.940
-GOOD MORNING, SPENCER.
-GOOD MORNING.

36:37.940 --> 36:40.780

36:42.780 --> 36:45.320

36:45.320 --> 36:47.280

36:47.280 --> 36:50.200

36:55.580 --> 36:56.670
WAIT. WHAT?

36:56.670 --> 36:58.750
I DITCHED WORKING SUNDAYS

36:58.750 --> 37:00.550
IN EXCHANGE FOR
VOLUNTEER WORK AT
YOUR BIG BROTHER CAMP.

37:00.550 --> 37:03.510
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE
MONEY FOR COLLEGE?

37:03.510 --> 37:06.220
THE ONLY THING THAT
MATTERS RIGHT NOW IS YOU.

37:06.220 --> 37:08.300
AND, LOOK, I KNOW IT'S HARD
WITH DAD BEING GONE.

37:08.300 --> 37:10.140
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO

37:10.140 --> 37:11.720
ABOUT THE MEMORIES YOU
WON'T GET TO MAKE WITH HIM.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.520
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING I
CAN DO ABOUT THE MEMORIES

37:13.520 --> 37:16.600

TOGETHER AS BROTHERS.

37:47.050 --> 37:50.050

37:50.050 --> 37:53.350
PODCAST?
IT'S A SCHOOL THING?

37:53.350 --> 37:56.440
UH, MORE OF A LIFE THING.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.440

NEED TO BE EXPOSED

37:59.440 --> 38:01.650
FOR THE HARM THEY CAUSE.

38:01.650 --> 38:04.820
AND MORE THAN THAT,
PEOPLE AROUND HERE
NEED TO UNDERSTAND

38:04.820 --> 38:07.410
THE INJUSTICES THAT ARE
GOING ON AND WHAT
THEY CAN DO TO HELP.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.620

39:54.470 --> 39:56.510
I GAVE YOU $4,000
FOR NOTHING.

39:56.510 --> 39:58.390
NO, THEY STILL GOT TO SKATE.

39:58.390 --> 40:00.600
MAN. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK,
AND WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.

40:00.600 --> 40:04.690

GET YOUR ASS ON.

40:18.490 --> 40:20.120

40:21.660 --> 40:24.330
MAN, YOU BETTER PULL IT
OUT YOUR ASS OR SOMETHING.

40:24.330 --> 40:26.540
-OR ELSE WHAT?
-MAN, TRY ME.

40:26.540 --> 40:28.300
AM I SUPPOSED
TO BE SCARED?

40:28.300 --> 40:30.300
FIRST, YOU RUNNING
ROUND WITH SNITCHES.

40:30.300 --> 40:33.090

TYRONE ROAM FREE
AFTER HE SHOT YOU?

40:33.090 --> 40:36.680

40:41.180 --> 40:44.520
COOP: HEY, YO, PREACH!

40:45.560 --> 40:47.900
PREACH!

40:50.780 --> 40:54.410

OF CHARACTER.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.660

40:56.660 --> 40:59.410
I GAVE A CUT TO
THE ORGANIZERS.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.040
PREACH, I AIN'T WANT
YOU TO DO ALL THAT.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.420
I JUST WANTED
TO GET THE MONEY BACK.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.800
YOU CAN'T JUST BE
BEATING UP PEOPLE 'CAUSE
YOU MAD AT TYRONE.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.590
LOOK, THIS AIN'T
ABOUT TYRONE.

41:10.590 --> 41:11.800
LOOK, I'M MAD AT YOU.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.130
MAN, YOU WEAK AS HELL
OUT HERE.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.640
AND YOU MAKING
ME WEAK, TOO.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.930
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT PLAYED,

41:17.930 --> 41:20.600
AND THAT'S WHY TYRONE
AND THE REST OF THESE
BLOCKHEAD BUSTERS

41:20.600 --> 41:22.430
THINK THEY CAN COME
AT ME SIDEWAYS.

41:22.430 --> 41:26.060
I'M TIRED OF SAVING
YOUR RAGGEDY ASS
TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

41:26.060 --> 41:28.610
LOOK, I'M KEEPING ALL THIS.

41:28.610 --> 41:31.190
CONSIDER THIS
YOUR FINAL DEBT TO ME.

41:31.190 --> 41:34.240
I'M DONE.

42:13.650 --> 42:15.240
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
