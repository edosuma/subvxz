09:08.161 --> 09:10.329
I guess your tech isn't my tech.

09:10.397 --> 09:11.730
Wow. Huh.

09:11.798 --> 09:15.367
It must have gotten messed
up in the last update.

09:15.435 --> 09:16.568
I'm sure.

09:16.636 --> 09:18.404
I'll fix it.

09:21.474 --> 09:22.574
Meet Jack Hardin.

09:22.642 --> 09:24.402
Lots of pictures of him
in the society pages.

09:24.403 --> 09:25.511
He runs a consulting firm.

09:25.579 --> 09:27.539
Now, there aren't many
details on how that company

09:27.540 --> 09:29.908
makes money, but he's known
for throwing exclusive parties.

09:29.916 --> 09:31.850
Hardin doesn't have a criminal record,

09:31.918 --> 09:33.798
but he has been
scandal-adjacent more than once.

09:33.799 --> 09:36.922
All right, so that leaves
us with Etta Brinks.

09:36.990 --> 09:39.458
What's our theory about
her connection to Hardin?

09:39.526 --> 09:41.446
- Revenge.
<i>- Kristen knew that she was in trouble</i>

09:41.561 --> 09:43.362
<i>when she failed to
hook the vice admiral.</i>

09:43.430 --> 09:45.197
If she called her sister,
that could explain

09:45.198 --> 09:47.132
why Etta took the risk of
returning to Louisiana,

09:47.200 --> 09:48.934
even though she had
an outstanding warrant.

09:49.002 --> 09:51.570
Yeah, if it were me, you
come after my family,

09:51.638 --> 09:54.139
I don't care who you
are, I'm coming for you.

09:54.207 --> 09:55.274
<i>Wow.</i>

09:55.342 --> 09:56.775
He's got a heart.

09:56.843 --> 09:58.644
And it's-it's filled with
vigilante vengeance,

09:58.712 --> 10:01.480
but... somewhere in that
suit, it... I mean, it's there.

10:01.548 --> 10:04.650
Etta only had two weeks
left on her sentence.

10:04.718 --> 10:06.985
There's probably a reason
why she got broken out now.

10:07.053 --> 10:09.221
Yeah, we're thinking another
party. Hardin didn't get

10:09.276 --> 10:11.156
- the information he needed...
- [PHONE RINGING]

10:11.157 --> 10:13.258
- ...so he needs to target someone else.
- All right.

10:13.326 --> 10:15.595
Let's track down Jack Hardin.
Odds are that'll lead us

10:15.662 --> 10:17.096
to whoever's impersonating Lasalle.

10:17.163 --> 10:18.163
Yeah.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.401
Hey, Loretta, what's up?

10:22.469 --> 10:25.804
Well, apparently, it's bad luck
to impersonate a murdered man.

10:25.872 --> 10:27.106
You found the suspect?

10:27.173 --> 10:29.641
Not before someone else found him first.

10:29.709 --> 10:31.710
He's been executed.

10:38.011 --> 10:39.811
<i>♪ ♪</i>

10:40.912 --> 10:43.612

10:46.878 --> 10:49.378
WADE: <i>It appears as if our
imposter was ambushed,</i>

10:49.446 --> 10:52.381
- then double-tapped.
- Looks like Etta Brinks' sister.

10:52.449 --> 10:54.684
WADE: <i>Uh-huh. Prints came
back to a Rhett Howard.</i>

10:54.751 --> 10:56.285
<i>He's got a rap sheet: fraud,</i>

10:56.353 --> 10:57.520
check-kiting, forgery.

10:57.588 --> 10:58.868
Which extends the list of people

10:58.922 --> 11:00.202
that might have wanted him dead.

11:00.203 --> 11:01.524
Not just Hardin and Etta Brinks

11:01.592 --> 11:03.860
but maybe one of his previous victims.

11:03.927 --> 11:05.895
Etta Brinks doesn't have
a history of violence.

11:05.963 --> 11:07.723
And yet two of her known
associates are dead.

11:07.791 --> 11:10.111
<i>I'll expedite the ballistics,
see if the same gun was used.</i>

11:10.112 --> 11:11.112
Thanks, Loretta.

11:11.134 --> 11:13.169
Look, if this guy sprung
Etta Brinks to get revenge

11:13.237 --> 11:14.837
on Hardin for Kristen's murder,

11:14.905 --> 11:17.006
they might be out of their league.

11:17.074 --> 11:20.409
Well, let's hope you find her
before she's body number three.

11:27.484 --> 11:28.924
CARTER: <i>Body belong to our imposter?</i>

11:28.925 --> 11:30.853
Yeah. That's his fake NCIS ID.

11:30.921 --> 11:33.089
It's a quality job. I could admire it

11:33.157 --> 11:35.077
if I wasn't so mad he
stole my friend's identity.

11:35.092 --> 11:37.052
Yeah, I found two other
high-level folks that, uh,

11:37.094 --> 11:39.562
look like they could have been
targeted by Hardin in the past.

11:39.630 --> 11:41.790
Seemed unlikely your friend
would've been the only one.

11:41.791 --> 11:43.199
He's my dad's friend.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.169
I read your file. What's
up with you Carters?

11:46.236 --> 11:48.538
Is the Navy like a family
business or something?

11:48.605 --> 11:50.231
[LAUGHS]

11:50.233 --> 11:51.842
No, no, um...

11:51.909 --> 11:54.944
My brother, he joined
because, well, you know,

11:55.012 --> 11:56.846
he's that guy, like my dad.

11:56.914 --> 11:59.782
And my sister joined
because she's super smart

11:59.850 --> 12:01.884
and they promised her
that she could do research.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.486
Hmm. And you?

12:04.588 --> 12:05.922
Hardin's back in New Orleans,

12:05.989 --> 12:07.557
<i>and, you know, I get why you're mad,</i>

12:07.624 --> 12:09.859
but you could also see it
as your friend reaching out

12:09.927 --> 12:11.861
from the great beyond to help us stop

12:11.929 --> 12:13.896
a vicious murdering jackass.

12:13.964 --> 12:15.731
Oh, is Lasalle a
crime-solving ghost now?

12:15.799 --> 12:17.400
I mean, if he'd never been impersonated,

12:17.467 --> 12:18.827
we would've never gotten involved.

12:18.835 --> 12:21.704
True.

12:22.272 --> 12:25.207
Don't think I didn't notice
you avoided my question.

12:33.483 --> 12:34.550
Hey.

12:34.618 --> 12:35.818
- Hey.
<i>- Wow.</i>

12:35.886 --> 12:38.120
- Smells fantastic.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

12:38.188 --> 12:40.890
I've been cooking a lot more recently,

12:40.958 --> 12:43.059
testing out some new recipes.

12:43.126 --> 12:45.561
- Cooking for two?
- Dad.

12:45.629 --> 12:48.397
Look, it doesn't take a
policeman to guess the reason

12:48.465 --> 12:51.800
you're down here is something to
do with that guy you're dating.

12:51.868 --> 12:53.669
You know his name.

12:54.337 --> 12:57.340
David, and the way you
said that tells me I'm right.

12:59.607 --> 13:01.109
So...

13:01.177 --> 13:02.678
not going well?

13:04.214 --> 13:05.982
Actually,

13:06.049 --> 13:08.784
it was great.

13:09.952 --> 13:11.320
Too great.

13:11.387 --> 13:14.423
- Things got intense, fast. Can you...?
- Yeah.

13:15.391 --> 13:16.459
And?

13:16.526 --> 13:20.329
[SIGHS] And there's a reason
I always promised myself

13:20.397 --> 13:22.932
I'd never date someone
in law enforcement.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.434
When did you make
that promise to yourself?

13:26.102 --> 13:28.236
A long time ago.

13:28.304 --> 13:31.941
I've seen the way it gets in
the way of, well, everything,

13:32.009 --> 13:33.026
<i>and...</i>

13:33.028 --> 13:35.279
And you don't want a
repeat of your childhood.

13:40.851 --> 13:42.485
So, okay,

13:42.552 --> 13:44.954
pretending like that doesn't sting...

13:46.890 --> 13:50.559
...what was the reason that
brought you down here?

13:51.427 --> 13:53.462
We were, uh, supposed to have

13:53.530 --> 13:56.132
a special night a few days ago.

13:56.199 --> 13:57.700
Dinner and a show,

13:57.768 --> 14:00.803
but he got called away to a case, so...

14:01.371 --> 14:03.506
Ah.

14:04.173 --> 14:05.607
Done that a few times.

14:05.675 --> 14:09.511
Never made your mother happy, either.

14:09.579 --> 14:11.813
So that was my sign. It was over.

14:11.881 --> 14:15.150
I came down here to clear my head.

14:15.218 --> 14:17.320
- So...
- Did you two talk about it?

14:17.387 --> 14:18.754
No.

14:20.222 --> 14:21.757
I've seen how those conversations go.

14:21.825 --> 14:25.093
I watched them a million times.
There's no way to win, is there?

14:25.161 --> 14:29.465
Well, sharing your feelings
shouldn't be a win/lose...

14:29.532 --> 14:30.533
Yeah, but what do my

14:30.600 --> 14:33.736
feelings matter when there's
some family out there suffering?

14:33.804 --> 14:36.005
All it does is make me
feel even more selfish.

14:36.073 --> 14:38.607
And all it does is confirm that
I will always be second to what

14:38.675 --> 14:40.843
- somebody else needs.
- Laurel,

14:40.911 --> 14:42.745
your mom and I had some issues,

14:42.813 --> 14:44.781
- but we always...
- You know, I have told you

14:44.783 --> 14:46.050
several times now

14:46.116 --> 14:48.117
that I don't want to talk about this.

14:53.657 --> 14:55.458
Look, I don't want to interfere

14:55.525 --> 14:59.061
and I'm not trying to
make you feel bad. I'm...

14:59.129 --> 15:02.164
I know. I just...

15:04.668 --> 15:06.235
I'm sorry. I'm not very hungry anymore.

15:06.303 --> 15:08.304
Excuse me.

15:14.144 --> 15:16.779
<i>It's not like I don't know that
her mother and I made mistakes.</i>

15:16.847 --> 15:18.714
Well, every parent makes mistakes.

15:18.782 --> 15:20.750
If you don't make the ones
your own parents make,

15:20.817 --> 15:23.219
- you make totally new ones.
- I know.

15:23.286 --> 15:25.454
But I also know it's not about me.

15:25.522 --> 15:26.989
I mean, it can't be about me,

15:27.057 --> 15:29.759
although it kind of
feels like it's about me.

15:29.826 --> 15:31.894
What's your gut tell you
about the situation?

15:31.962 --> 15:35.498
Maybe she doesn't want
a cop for a partner,

15:35.565 --> 15:37.767
maybe that's fair,

15:37.834 --> 15:39.769
but last night

15:39.836 --> 15:41.837
she was more torn up
than I'd ever seen her.

15:41.905 --> 15:43.305
She misses him.

15:43.373 --> 15:45.908
Well, I'm just afraid that
she's pushing him away

15:45.976 --> 15:48.010
for all the wrong reasons,

15:48.078 --> 15:50.946
and by the time she works
through the whole mess of it,

15:51.014 --> 15:52.448
it'll be too late.

15:52.516 --> 15:56.419
Or maybe she's giving
herself space and time

15:56.486 --> 15:58.754
to figure that out for herself.

15:58.822 --> 16:01.624
You know, when I was young and dating,

16:01.691 --> 16:05.428
I was so concerned as to
whether or not a man liked me,

16:05.495 --> 16:08.130
I didn't think about my own feelings.

16:08.198 --> 16:12.101
I wish I'd had Laurel's
maturity at her age.

16:12.169 --> 16:15.504
Laurel is a very strong,
confident woman.

16:15.572 --> 16:17.506
Yes, it's as if she was raised

16:17.574 --> 16:21.110
by supportive, loving parents.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.315
Then... just thinking about it,

16:26.383 --> 16:30.052
she never actually asked
me for any help, just space.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.353
Oh.

16:31.421 --> 16:35.691
I just should've kept my mouth shut,

16:35.759 --> 16:38.327
but old habits die hard, right?

16:38.395 --> 16:41.130
Well, just because we learn
something about ourselves

16:41.198 --> 16:44.366
doesn't mean we can always do
something with the information.

16:45.234 --> 16:48.003
Hope I haven't made
things worse for her.

16:48.070 --> 16:51.407
Dwayne, when her heart was hurting,

16:51.475 --> 16:55.478
who did she turn to
to feel safe and loved?

16:56.645 --> 16:57.913
To me.

16:57.981 --> 17:00.916
She still needs to feel safe and loved.

17:00.984 --> 17:02.551
You got this.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.088
Thank you, Loretta.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.257
Anytime.

17:08.325 --> 17:11.493
So, now, curious about the case?

17:12.060 --> 17:13.328
Of course.

17:13.396 --> 17:15.498
These traces of soap and shampoo

17:15.565 --> 17:18.166
were still on the body,
and it came back as

17:18.234 --> 17:19.468
a specific brand name

17:19.536 --> 17:22.938
used only by the NOPSI
Hotel, here in New Orleans.

17:23.006 --> 17:26.375
Well, if he and our missing
prisoner were working together,

17:26.443 --> 17:28.077
she might still be there.

17:28.144 --> 17:31.780

desk this morning or what?

we need a key to his room.

give you what you need.

- Great, thanks.
- HANNAH: <i>Okay, I'll try.</i>

17:54.810 --> 17:56.605
That's the best I can do, Ryan. Bye.

17:56.673 --> 17:57.706
How'd it go?

17:57.774 --> 18:01.277
Um, Ryan just made dinner reservations

18:01.344 --> 18:02.711
for us with Veronica.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.013
Okay, are you going?

18:04.080 --> 18:06.649
No. I can't think of anything
more uncomfortable.

18:06.716 --> 18:08.997
For what it's worth, I think
Ryan's doing the right thing.

18:09.019 --> 18:11.579
Don't you want to meet the woman
who could be Naomi's stepmother?

18:11.580 --> 18:13.055
Whoa. I... [STAMMERS]

18:13.123 --> 18:14.924
I-I can't wrap my head
around that right now.

18:14.991 --> 18:17.826
It doesn't seem like Ryan has
a problem with it, though.

18:17.894 --> 18:20.429
Ma'am, when I went to make the
key, I was alerted that a charge

18:20.497 --> 18:23.332
was just made to the room in
the lobby bar right over there.

18:24.399 --> 18:25.634
There she is.

18:25.702 --> 18:26.902
Redhead.

18:28.672 --> 18:33.475
I hated that one. Two more just like it.

Etta Brinks?

18:36.046 --> 18:37.680
You're under arrest.

18:41.418 --> 18:43.185
Rhett Howard got you out of jail

18:43.253 --> 18:45.754
and ends up dead less
than 24 hours later.

18:45.822 --> 18:48.190
Look, I don't know why
he busted me out of jail.

18:48.258 --> 18:50.459
- I was just glad to go.
- He forged the identity

18:50.527 --> 18:52.962
of a man who worked for
me, a man who was killed

18:53.029 --> 18:55.197
- in the line of duty.
- Well, like I said...

18:55.265 --> 18:56.599
Stop playing games.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.201
Right now your best case

Tangipahoa Parish Jail.

They'll tag on a year for the jailbreak.

19:05.175 --> 19:08.110
We'll tag on three because you conspired

19:08.178 --> 19:10.479
with a man who impersonated
a federal officer.

19:10.547 --> 19:13.115
That last bit is federal time.

19:13.183 --> 19:14.783
<i>Means you get moved to a federal jail</i>

19:14.851 --> 19:17.019

A man named Jack
Hardin killed my sister.

No,

- Hardin's back in New Orleans.

planning another party.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.862
Rhett forged me an invitation.
