- I know. It's not.

10:00.807 --> 10:02.197
That's the point.

10:02.207 --> 10:04.876
I mean, I've been with
Brian for 10 years.

10:04.886 --> 10:07.280
I mean, I don't even know what
"like me" means anymore.

10:07.290 --> 10:09.248
Well, having an affair
a month before your wedding

10:09.283 --> 10:10.901
seems like a really weird
way to figure it out.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.286
It's not an affair. It's just...
It's that Brian's the only guy

10:13.320 --> 10:14.970
that I've... I've been with.

10:14.980 --> 10:17.021
- Do you not want to get married?
- Of course I do.

10:17.031 --> 10:18.624
It's like when you buy a new car

10:18.659 --> 10:20.723
and it works great, never breaks down,

10:20.733 --> 10:22.136
it's super comfortable...

10:22.146 --> 10:24.646
You don't just trade it in
for a new model years later.

10:24.656 --> 10:26.423
That's exactly what you do.
It's called leasing.

10:26.433 --> 10:28.261
Well, fine. Well, I'm not like that.

10:28.271 --> 10:29.888
- And I don't want a new car.
- Okay.

10:29.898 --> 10:33.276
Just to test drive
something new one time

10:33.286 --> 10:34.913
before I walk down the aisle.

10:34.923 --> 10:37.318
Kate, I'm... I'm really sorry,
but Harry would kill me

10:37.328 --> 10:40.571
if I had anything to do with this,
and Brian seems like a great guy.

10:40.581 --> 10:43.893
[Chuckles] He rescues
baby animals for a living.

10:43.903 --> 10:47.553
He's a vet! He helps all animals.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.310
[Sighs] Okay. Fine. I get it.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.495
I'll do it myself.

10:53.535 --> 10:56.038
I've heard of this place
called the Basement?

10:56.048 --> 10:58.187
Apparently, it's where all
the hot actors hang out.

10:58.197 --> 10:59.994
- Do you know it?
- Uh, yeah. I know it.

11:00.004 --> 11:01.529
And I know you're not going there.

11:01.539 --> 11:03.949
It's gross and sticky,
and so is the clientele.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.771
No. No way.

11:05.781 --> 11:09.075
See? See, this is why I
need your help. Come on.

11:10.558 --> 11:12.645

11:12.880 --> 11:14.647
Okay. Uh...

11:14.991 --> 11:17.371
I... I'll help, but only
if we do it my way.

11:17.381 --> 11:19.719
Thank you. Thank you.

11:24.291 --> 11:28.444
Hannah claimed she was kicking
me out because of my "energy,"

11:28.454 --> 11:30.663
but the real reason
why she's kicking me out

11:30.697 --> 11:33.265
is because the other mom's
kept asking me questions...

11:33.300 --> 11:36.035
Not her... Because
they read the article!

11:36.588 --> 11:38.037
I don't blame her.

11:38.071 --> 11:40.425
Would you want a slut-spert
in your class?

11:40.435 --> 11:42.483
That's what Jello1933 calls me.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.676
All right. You know what?

11:43.686 --> 11:46.278
It's time for you to step away
from the Internet comments.

11:46.313 --> 11:48.780
This stupid article is ruining my life.

11:48.790 --> 11:51.594
I didn't even know so many
people still got newspapers.

11:51.604 --> 11:55.629
Ooh. You look smoking-hot in this pic.

11:55.729 --> 11:57.790
I'm sorry, but you do.

11:57.824 --> 12:00.026
This whole thing
is getting out of control.

12:00.060 --> 12:04.034
I wrote that book as a form of
therapy, not a how-to manual.

12:04.044 --> 12:07.800
And Barbara's got me doing
Q&As at porn shops.

12:07.834 --> 12:11.555
- I went to medical school!
- Okay. Yeah. Sure. I get it.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.173
Um... is it okay if I keep this?

12:14.207 --> 12:16.539
What? No.

12:21.106 --> 12:23.349
- Aren't you off the clock now?
- Yeah.

12:25.514 --> 12:28.354
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

12:30.803 --> 12:32.289
So, you know, I told Kate that I'd help,

12:32.299 --> 12:34.075
but really I'm just gonna ride it out.

12:34.085 --> 12:36.525
Hopefully, she realizes
how crazy this all is.

12:36.535 --> 12:38.410
I don't know. That
doesn't sound like Kate.

12:38.420 --> 12:40.866
Exactly. See, none of
this sounds like Kate.

12:40.901 --> 12:43.836
She's supposed to be the Davis
with the common sense.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.705
I don't want to talk about the article.

12:45.739 --> 12:48.340
Okay, hey, but wait. Can we at
least talk about the picture?

as a medical professional?

12:58.258 --> 12:59.642
Yes, please.

No. [Laughs] Not me.

Um, Kate, actually.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.672
- Oh.
- Yeah. I know.

13:15.682 --> 13:17.230
Apparently, she wants to have

13:17.240 --> 13:20.987
some sexy stranger danger before
she gets married, and I don't...

13:20.997 --> 13:23.909
Well, new experiences
can be healthy for a marriage

13:23.944 --> 13:26.647
as long as both partners
are on the same page,

13:26.657 --> 13:28.867
but I wouldn't recommend
it at this stage.

13:28.877 --> 13:31.441
- Thank you.
- Hey. I agree, okay?

13:31.451 --> 13:33.844
I just wanted some professional backup.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.303
Listen, she's obviously gonna be
at the engagement dinner.

13:36.313 --> 13:39.244

13:40.228 --> 13:43.102

half-off just for today?

how to ring them up again.

- Sorry.

the details for the new bistro.

14:28.298 --> 14:29.975
Hmm?

14:30.010 --> 14:32.611
Oh, she's great.
I think she's, uh... [Chuckles]

14:32.646 --> 14:33.946
She's really excited to be here.

14:33.980 --> 14:37.708
What do you say we all get dinner
tonight before my meeting?

14:37.718 --> 14:39.674
What do you...
You, me, and Kate? Together?

14:39.684 --> 14:42.822
Yeah. Just the three of us.
Where is she, anyway?

14:42.856 --> 14:47.893
Oh, well, she's probably
doing some online shopping.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.330

14:51.364 --> 14:53.221
You're acting stranger than usual.

14:53.231 --> 14:56.125
No, I just don't think dinner's
a really good idea. You know?

14:56.135 --> 14:58.446
Kate wants to do this thing and I don't
think you want to be there for it.

14:58.456 --> 15:00.924
- Well, why not? What thing?
- Mm.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.175
Oh, you're having a girls night,
like a bachelorette party.

15:03.185 --> 15:04.808
Not with a male stripper, Joss.

15:04.818 --> 15:06.879
Uh, yeah, like that.

a one-night stand for your sister

- What? She wants to have an affair?
- Well...

15:18.813 --> 15:20.693
What, has she lost her mind? Have you?

15:20.727 --> 15:24.055
Hey! Whoa. Easy now.
I... I tried to talk her out of it.

15:24.065 --> 15:27.723
How could she do this to Brian?
He's funny. My family adores him.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.790
He digs my food.
He never misses my birthday.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.923
Okay, now I'm starting to worry
that you want to marry Brian.

15:31.933 --> 15:34.947
- I want Kate to marry Brian.
- Apparently, that's still the plan.

15:34.957 --> 15:36.734
She said that he...
He knows about all of it,

15:36.768 --> 15:38.736
and he's totally fine
with her sowing her oats.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.413
Well, then she's completely delusional,

15:40.423 --> 15:43.074
because there is no way you can go back
to normal after something like this.

15:43.084 --> 15:46.044

I've been following your work

19:29.391 --> 19:31.682
since your sous chef days at Lucques.

19:31.717 --> 19:33.594
And I have to say, I'm very impressed.

19:33.604 --> 19:34.753
Wow.

19:34.763 --> 19:37.090
Never thought I'd be a blip
on the radar for a guy like you.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.768
So you know about me.
You're familiar with what I do?

19:39.803 --> 19:42.036
- It would be weird if I wasn't.
- [Cellphone chimes, vibrates]

19:42.046 --> 19:43.921
I do have to apologize.

19:43.931 --> 19:48.744
My next meeting got pulled up,
so I only have a few minutes.

19:48.778 --> 19:52.748
I heard about your bistro,
and I have some ideas.

19:52.782 --> 19:54.416
Sorry, how did you hear about my bistro?

19:54.451 --> 19:55.784
I know lots of people.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.420
I want to help you
make your place great.

19:58.455 --> 20:01.690
Wow, uh, Jonathan, I'm not
really looking for a partner.

20:01.725 --> 20:03.325
Just imagine...

20:03.360 --> 20:06.662
You can do anything you want
to do with your restaurant,

20:06.696 --> 20:10.350
no matter what it costs.
That's what I'm offering you.

20:10.441 --> 20:13.802
I help fund dreams
for people who I believe in.

20:14.303 --> 20:16.171
Don't look at me as a partner,

20:16.206 --> 20:19.775
more like an angel investor.

20:20.710 --> 20:22.378
- Whatever I want.
- Whatever.

20:22.412 --> 20:23.779
[Cellphone chimes] Oh.

20:23.813 --> 20:26.181
I'm sorry. I have to go.

20:26.216 --> 20:29.397
But please stay as long as you want.

Aah!

- Oh.
- Oh.

- [Chuckling] My bad.
- Okay, I'll get us some new drinks.

22:04.678 --> 22:06.244
So, yeah, this has been great,

22:06.254 --> 22:08.247
but why don't we go downstairs
and check out the other bar,

22:08.281 --> 22:09.412
where we can get some dessert or...

22:09.422 --> 22:11.214
- I'm just starting to have fun!
- Yeah, I know.

22:11.224 --> 22:13.564
- Kate, I just don't think that...
- Joss!

22:13.574 --> 22:15.174
- Harry? What are you...
- I called you a dozen times

22:15.184 --> 22:17.048
and you still didn't answer...
Neither of you.

22:17.058 --> 22:19.258
Well, yeah. It's... it's impossible
to hear a phone in here.

22:19.292 --> 22:20.748
Joss, you said you were gonna stop Kate.

22:20.758 --> 22:22.494
Instead, you're out
doing God knows what.

22:22.529 --> 22:23.896
- You told him?
- Of course she told me.

22:23.930 --> 22:25.898
No, okay. I...
It's more like he guessed.

22:25.932 --> 22:27.499
This is none of your business, Harry.

22:27.534 --> 22:30.150
Whatever I decide to do,
it doesn't concern you.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.208
- Is there a problem here?
- Stay out of it, mate.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.258
- I've given this a lot of thought.
- This isn't normal behavior

22:34.268 --> 22:35.962
for someone who's about to get married.

22:35.972 --> 22:37.109
Like you can talk.

22:37.593 --> 22:38.922
What is that supposed to mean?

22:38.932 --> 22:40.933
You're the one who's marrying
your ex-sister-in-law.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.282
And last time I checked, there's
nothing normal about that.

22:43.316 --> 22:46.095
What do you think Mum's gonna
say when she finds out, huh?

22:46.105 --> 22:47.853
Wait, y-your mother loves me,

22:47.888 --> 22:49.788
- but is that true?
- Joss.

22:50.633 --> 22:53.861
You really think everyone's
gonna fly in to celebrate this?

22:53.871 --> 22:55.300
I thought you were happy for us.

22:55.310 --> 22:58.764
Well, I lied, and
everyone else will, too.

22:59.468 --> 23:01.470
Have you told your mom yet? Or Savi?

23:01.480 --> 23:02.768
I left a message...

23:02.802 --> 23:03.969
'Cause it doesn't seem like
the sort of thing

23:04.004 --> 23:05.371
I'd be screaming from the rooftops.

23:05.405 --> 23:07.191
Okay, Kate... enough. We're going.

23:07.201 --> 23:08.893
This isn't like the time you
tried to stop Billy Barns

23:08.903 --> 23:10.678
from kissing me in school. I'm not 12.

23:10.688 --> 23:12.413
Billy Barnes was a moron
and you were too young.

23:12.423 --> 23:14.126
- Now come on.
- She said she wants to stay.

23:14.136 --> 23:15.475
Didn't ask you, pal.

23:15.509 --> 23:16.809
- Whoa, whoa...
- [Grunts]

23:17.234 --> 23:19.245
- Man: Hey! You. Out.
- Okay.

23:21.463 --> 23:24.150
Uh, yeah. Okay. We're... we're going.

23:24.962 --> 23:26.556
- We're going.
- I'm not going anywhere.

23:26.566 --> 23:28.087
Fine. Do whatever you want.

23:28.122 --> 23:30.857
(♪)

23:31.502 --> 23:32.859
What did you expect me to do?

23:33.102 --> 23:35.662
I mean, Kate's a grown woman
with her own vagina choices.

23:35.696 --> 23:38.602
Oh... Kate. Please, do not use Kate
and vagina in the same sentence.

23:38.612 --> 23:40.300
The point is I can't keep her hostage,

23:40.334 --> 23:42.177
and you're acting like a crazy person.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.822
All right, fine. Maybe I didn't
handle it in the best way.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.657
- Sorry.
- You think, Harry?

23:46.692 --> 23:47.869
'Cause now she's in there by herself,

23:47.879 --> 23:49.060
which is exactly what
we're trying to avoid.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.997
- She's making a huge mistake.
- You know what?

23:51.007 --> 23:52.463
If you were paying any attention, Harry,

23:52.497 --> 23:54.150
you would have realized
that's exactly what she thinks

23:54.160 --> 23:56.036
about the two of us.

23:56.418 --> 23:58.636
I mean, is this weird, what we're doing?

23:58.670 --> 24:02.194
I just... Yeah, I... I...
I still haven't told Savi,

24:02.204 --> 24:03.674
but, you know, it's scary.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.309
She was only here
for a little bit of the trial,

24:05.344 --> 24:07.575
but we're not exactly in the
best place. But tell me, Harry,

24:07.585 --> 24:09.409
why haven't you told
any of your family about this?

24:09.419 --> 24:11.204
Joss, please don't read
too much into that.

24:11.214 --> 24:14.501
What? No. I... I think that maybe
we should postpone the party.

24:14.511 --> 24:15.920
At least until Kate leaves.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.922
I don't want to be throwing
this in everybody's face,

24:17.956 --> 24:19.690
especially if she's uncomfortable.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.092
No, Joss. April and Karen

24:21.126 --> 24:22.464
have put a lot of planning
into this party,

24:22.474 --> 24:25.002
so I will be there, with or without you.

24:25.393 --> 24:28.048
- So what I want doesn't matter.
- In this case, no. Not really.

24:28.058 --> 24:30.401
You're being very melodramatic.

24:32.661 --> 24:34.155
- Well, you coming?
- [Sighs] You know what?

call me "little girl" forever?

Even when you go off to college.

25:02.694 --> 25:05.489
- Mom, what happened?
- Oh, I was just having a rough time

25:05.499 --> 25:06.938
getting into the swing of things.

25:06.948 --> 25:08.666
I don't know.
It looks pretty good to me.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.501
Eh. It's more of the same.

25:10.535 --> 25:15.206
Carol wants more "me," and I
wish I knew what that meant.

25:16.186 --> 25:18.209
Do you remember last year
at my new school,

25:18.243 --> 25:20.687
I kept trying to fit in so much?

25:20.697 --> 25:22.527
You told me all the time to be myself

25:22.537 --> 25:24.415
and try not to be
what other people wanted?

25:24.449 --> 25:25.850
- Yes.
- You told me, like, every day.

25:25.884 --> 25:27.828
- It started to get annoying.
- Where is this going?

25:27.838 --> 25:32.256
But you were right. I finally
listened, and it all worked out.

25:32.291 --> 25:35.251
So believe in yourself, Mom,
because you're pretty great.

She was judging me.

27:07.191 --> 27:08.565
She was the judgy one.

Apparently, she's weirded out
that I'm marrying Harry

27:10.467 --> 27:12.268

as a housewarming.

I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

turner... A hot page turner.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.383
I'm happy you enjoyed it,
but I'm starting to wonder

28:50.393 --> 28:52.371
if publishing it was a mistake.

28:52.381 --> 28:55.132
I care about being taken
seriously in my field

to be one or the other?

- Oh.

You know, one thing I've really
learned since being on this board,

29:25.441 --> 29:29.037
it's always best to be honest,
even brutally so.

29:29.047 --> 29:30.590
Brutally, huh?

29:30.600 --> 29:34.550

- Kate?

Not so much.

- Uh, not speaking.

- That's great, Marc.
- And here I was thinking

31:19.290 --> 31:20.996
I was just an amateur
who couldn't keep up,

31:21.006 --> 31:22.807
and they kept talking
about my skill level

bring to the group.

Aren't you gonna ask
how my meeting went?

31:32.427 --> 31:34.828
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I totally forgot.

31:34.838 --> 31:37.588
Well don't worry, because it
went terribly is how it went.

31:37.623 --> 31:39.190
Oh, come on.
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

31:39.224 --> 31:40.758
- Start from the beginning.
- Well, the beginning is

31:40.792 --> 31:42.393
that I only had two days to do it,

31:42.427 --> 31:44.638
and what was I thinking that
that would be enough time?

31:44.648 --> 31:46.397
And then when I finally
got into a groove,

31:46.431 --> 31:49.131
I had to come and replace
you in the store.

31:49.512 --> 31:51.452
Wait, are you saying this is my fault?

31:51.462 --> 31:54.272
No. I mean, I'm not saying
it's not your fault.

31:54.306 --> 31:57.775
She did mention that it looked
rushed. So maybe if my thing

31:57.809 --> 32:01.245
had mattered as much as your thing,
this would have turned out differently.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.247
That's what I'm saying.

32:03.534 --> 32:05.316
I need a refill.

32:08.270 --> 32:10.922
So, how's the search going?

32:10.956 --> 32:14.105
- Find the right guy?
- [Scoffs] No.

32:15.394 --> 32:17.523
But I actually needed
to apologize to you.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.524
I shouldn't have brushed off
your advice earlier.

32:19.534 --> 32:23.354
- You were just trying to help.
- Please, you don't have to apologize.

32:23.364 --> 32:27.405
Joss means well, but sometimes she
can choose the wrong approach.

32:27.868 --> 32:29.407
True.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.976
But she did give me your book,

32:32.886 --> 32:35.228
which I read very quickly.

32:35.238 --> 32:36.280
Oh, God.

32:36.315 --> 32:38.371
This book is gonna be the end of me.

32:38.381 --> 32:42.405
That part about the hotel makes
what I'm doing look so innocent.

32:42.415 --> 32:43.921
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

The point is, I think the book is great.

what I need to let go of.

actually helped someone.

Because I... I was drunk last
night. Like, pbht, super drunk.

- I noticed.
- I was so over the line with

33:35.420 --> 33:37.440
everything that I said
about you and Harry.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.510
It was really all my stuff, you know.

33:39.544 --> 33:42.313
Well, let's just say that apparently
you weren't over the line,

33:42.323 --> 33:45.330
because everyone thinks it's weird,
and now I think it's weird,

34:14.079 --> 34:15.478
about the bistro, and then took off.

34:15.514 --> 34:18.150
- Haven't heard from the guy since.
- That was probably for the best.

is without doing some bad stuff.

34:20.585 --> 34:22.931

back to the original plan

34:22.940 --> 34:24.926

should get dinner started soon.

not particularly hungry.

[Both chuckle]

39:21.038 --> 39:22.542
He's not the only one.

39:22.552 --> 39:24.173
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

39:24.208 --> 39:25.617
Oh, yeah?

39:27.045 --> 39:29.012
[Both chuckle]

39:30.911 --> 39:32.778
[Knocking]

39:35.409 --> 39:39.722
So I obviously can't
cook like you, Harry,

39:39.757 --> 39:42.634
but I'm great at take-out,

39:42.644 --> 39:45.283
and I was hoping these
would somehow make up

39:45.293 --> 39:47.013
for how I've been acting.

39:48.087 --> 39:50.491
Well, I will graciously
accept your burrito.

39:50.501 --> 39:52.869
I admit that it's helping a little.

39:52.903 --> 39:54.350
Agreed.

39:55.539 --> 39:59.017
And there's something that
I need to tell you both.

39:59.199 --> 40:00.592
[Sighs]

40:01.909 --> 40:03.539
Brian had an affair.

40:05.762 --> 40:07.317
Brian.

40:09.086 --> 40:11.054
The guy who talks to little animals

40:11.088 --> 40:13.608
- cheated on you.
- Yeah.

40:15.526 --> 40:19.915
And I had this stupid idea
that if I did it, too,

40:19.925 --> 40:21.998
then somehow we'd be even.

40:22.032 --> 40:24.662
Because that's all...
That's all that Brian wants,

40:24.672 --> 40:27.870
for us to move forward and be together.

40:28.411 --> 40:31.561
But after last night, I realized...

40:34.621 --> 40:37.078
I want what you guys have,

40:37.615 --> 40:41.084
which is why I called off the wedding.

40:42.047 --> 40:45.088
Oh, Kate. I'm so sorry.

40:45.943 --> 40:49.058
- You sure about this?
- [Voice breaking] Yeah.

40:49.093 --> 40:50.785
[Sighs]

40:50.795 --> 40:53.316
But the good news is, um,

40:53.671 --> 40:56.009
I've decided I'm going to stay here.

40:56.246 --> 40:59.004
No point in going home to my...
my broken life in Sydney.

40:59.014 --> 41:02.782
I'm going to stay here and
find the true love of my life.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.092
- Here.
- In L.A.

41:06.575 --> 41:07.859
[Chuckles]

41:09.989 --> 41:13.149
Hey. How did it go at the, uh, Sex Stop?

41:13.183 --> 41:15.504
- You glad you did it?
- Actually, I am.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.834
It was pretty great.

41:16.844 --> 41:20.161
I forgot how good it feels
to share my expertise,

41:20.171 --> 41:22.556
and I learned what a demisexual is.

41:22.566 --> 41:27.063
Oh. That's good to know.
Might come in useful in the future.

41:27.764 --> 41:29.914
Wait. I want to...

41:29.924 --> 41:34.185
thank you for saying what you said
the other day. You were right.

41:34.786 --> 41:37.841
I can be a sexpert and a doctor.

41:37.851 --> 41:40.345
They're not mutually exclusive.

41:41.674 --> 41:44.532
Who cares if some people
have a problem with it?

41:45.360 --> 41:48.377
Not everyone's gonna agree with
what you choose to write about.

41:48.387 --> 41:51.519
Look, what people do
after they read your book,

41:51.529 --> 41:53.385
that's on them.

41:53.395 --> 41:55.200
You can't be responsible

41:55.210 --> 41:57.705
for anyone else's bad decisions.

41:57.951 --> 42:00.163
Just my own, right?

42:01.420 --> 42:03.800
