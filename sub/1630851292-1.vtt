All right,
time for 8:15 drop-off.

00:37.872 --> 00:41.064
Now Mommy's on a quick
break till 3:30.

00:41.066 --> 00:42.949
(sighs)
Toughest job in the world.

00:43.102 --> 00:45.711
Oh, look, Kylie's mom
is out of rehab.

00:45.862 --> 00:47.713
Good morning, little guy.

00:47.864 --> 00:50.440
Hey, Janet, good to see you.

00:50.459 --> 00:53.293
Hey, listen, thank you so much
for your apology email.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.203
An individual one
would have been nice,

00:55.297 --> 00:57.723
but one to the whole class
was fine, too.

00:57.874 --> 01:00.375
Have a good day, Stewie.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.561
(loud thud)

01:02.712 --> 01:05.105
Oh, my God, please be
a dog. Please be a dog.

01:07.068 --> 01:09.142
(crying):
Ow. Ow...

01:09.295 --> 01:11.052
Oh, my God, it's a kid!

01:11.072 --> 01:13.647
It's Doug!
Nice hit, bitch.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.057
Oh, and Elsa underwear.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.161
This day just keeps
getting better!

01:22.065 --> 01:23.974
Well, thank you all for coming.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.085
Can I get anyone
something to drink?

01:26.236 --> 01:28.478
I'm fine, but Doug's mother
would probably like

01:28.497 --> 01:30.831
three martinis, and then to have
unprotected sex

01:30.983 --> 01:32.240
with her boss at work.

01:32.334 --> 01:35.260
And Doug's father would love
a glass of warm tap water

01:35.412 --> 01:37.170
and to never make more
than $30,000 a year

01:37.323 --> 01:38.822
for the rest of his life.

01:38.841 --> 01:41.600
And here we go.

01:41.827 --> 01:44.252
Okay, well, I am just so sorry

01:44.271 --> 01:46.012
about what happened with Doug.

01:46.165 --> 01:48.014
I just didn't see
the little guy.

01:48.167 --> 01:50.334
Well, maybe you ought
to get your eyes examined.

01:50.352 --> 01:53.503
I appreciate that it was
an accident, Mrs. Griffin.

01:53.597 --> 01:55.839
But nonetheless,
we've retained a lawyer.

01:55.932 --> 01:58.024
Well, there must be some way
short of a lawsuit

01:58.119 --> 01:59.434
we can make this up to you.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.511
Well, this is my weekend
with Doug,

02:01.530 --> 02:03.438
but I've got tickets
to see Lana Del Rey

02:03.532 --> 02:05.682
with our former nanny Jessica.

02:05.701 --> 02:06.867
(exhales sharply)

02:07.019 --> 02:10.036
She's 24.
So as a form of settlement,

02:10.131 --> 02:12.689
maybe this weekend you can
put together a tree house

02:12.782 --> 02:14.024
I don't want to deal with.

02:14.193 --> 02:16.802
Fine. If that's what
I have to do to make this right,

02:17.029 --> 02:19.972
then Peter and my children will
build your son's tree house.

02:20.123 --> 02:20.973
Deal.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.142
All right, I guess now
the four men

02:23.327 --> 02:25.535
awkwardly sit here while
my mom gives your mom

02:25.629 --> 02:27.663
a tour of the house
that doesn't deserve one.

02:27.723 --> 02:32.651
LOIS: And this is
a room adjacent to the room

02:32.802 --> 02:33.801
we were just in.

02:33.896 --> 02:36.196
DOUG'S MOTHER:
Ooh, what a fun house.

02:39.234 --> 02:41.735
Okay, Mrs. Griffin,
tell me what you see.

02:41.887 --> 02:44.812
Um, I see a cow in a lab coat,

02:44.907 --> 02:46.665
some vultures
in a cowboy hat,

02:46.816 --> 02:50.410
and a dog trying to trick a cat
into a clothes dryer.

02:50.562 --> 02:53.230
Just as I thought.
You're Far-Sided.

02:53.248 --> 02:55.340
Oh, no.
What-what do I do about it?

02:55.492 --> 02:57.250
Oh, well, I'm no doctor,
but I would say

02:57.403 --> 02:59.236
you either need to get glasses
or maybe LASIK.

02:59.254 --> 03:01.180
Is that the surgery people get

03:01.331 --> 03:02.514
and then tell everybody
they got it?

03:02.666 --> 03:05.166
Yes, it's the veganism
of elective surgery.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.501
If you're unsure
of what to do,

03:06.595 --> 03:08.503
here's a video of Radiohead
front man

03:08.597 --> 03:11.506
and super weirdo Thom Yorke
to help you decide.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.417
Hello, I'm Thom Yorke.

03:13.435 --> 03:15.602
You might know me
from Radiohead

03:15.696 --> 03:19.364
or my passing resemblance
to a melting Tilda Swinton.

03:19.516 --> 03:22.609
Not many people know
that I'm blind in one eye.

03:22.761 --> 03:24.203
Can you guess which one?

03:24.354 --> 03:26.112
-This is awful.
-Wait, just give it
a few minutes.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.873
All his stuff starts
kind of slow.

03:28.024 --> 03:29.766
Fine, I'll get the LASIK.

03:29.785 --> 03:31.284
Great. Make an appointment
with my nurse.

03:31.437 --> 03:33.712
Now here's a lollipop
from the Sackler family

03:33.863 --> 03:35.631

Mrs. Griffin,
the surgery was a success.

04:00.390 --> 04:02.466
And by that,
I mean the hospital agreed

04:02.484 --> 04:03.633
to take your Discover card.

04:03.727 --> 04:05.635
Plus, we'll get one percent

What do you mean you're blind?

04:23.155 --> 04:25.264
-Y-You can't see me right now?
-No!

04:25.415 --> 04:29.009
But you can still see, like,

04:29.161 --> 04:30.827
But, Mom, we got you a balloo...

Shh, shh, shh.

Don't worry, Lois, we'll be

Oh-oh, oh, no, no!

I'm coming, balloon!

about this.

Don't worry, Lois,
I went blind a while back.

05:05.455 --> 05:07.197
It was cool.
They're some of the last people

05:08.700 --> 05:10.642
-Dad!
-It's fine, they won't see this.

05:10.869 --> 05:13.145
Dr. Hartman, you said
there was very little risk

05:13.296 --> 05:15.147
to LASIK, but now
I am blind.

05:15.298 --> 05:16.222
How did this happen?

05:16.375 --> 05:17.799
Okay, look,
this isn't my fault.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.709
It was Take-Your-Cat-
To-Work day.

05:19.803 --> 05:22.070
(meows)

05:25.993 --> 05:29.903
Dr. Hartman, what does this
mean, you know, for me?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.555
Well, whatever your wife
did for you,

05:31.573 --> 05:33.223
you'll now have to do
for yourselves.

05:33.241 --> 05:35.108
And until she gets used
to her new life,

05:35.260 --> 05:36.893
you'll need to take care of her.

05:36.912 --> 05:38.578
Feed her, bathe her,
drive her places.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.715
-They're gone, aren't they?
-They left, yes.

05:45.587 --> 05:48.180
There they are.
I thought we said 10:00 sharp,

05:48.407 --> 05:50.331
but we must have said 10:18.

05:50.351 --> 05:52.667
(chuckles)
No one's fault,
but going forward,

05:52.686 --> 05:55.837
let's make sure we respect
each other's time, hmm?

05:55.856 --> 05:58.098
-You must be Chris.
-I must?

05:58.192 --> 06:00.525
You know, we have
a friend in common:

06:00.677 --> 06:01.918
Mr. Herbert.

06:01.937 --> 06:03.195
How do you know Mr. Herbert?

06:03.422 --> 06:05.864
We're friends. Sometimes
he comes to my art shows,

06:06.091 --> 06:07.107
and we get ice cream after.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.201
Let me guess,
he takes you to the park

06:09.428 --> 06:11.444
where the swings go really high?

06:11.597 --> 06:13.263
-He does.
-Uh-huh.

06:13.281 --> 06:15.432
That'll stop.
And the ice cream?

06:15.450 --> 06:16.691
Don't get used to it.

06:16.785 --> 06:20.027
I've seen a thousand of you.
I've outlasted them.

06:20.122 --> 06:21.529
I'll outlast you.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.883
Okay, uh, my dad left
a note for you, Mr. Griffin.

06:25.034 --> 06:28.111
"Griffins, build this tree house
for my son.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.463
"He will love it for a year,
until my housekeeper

it doesn't have electricity

"or running water.

She walked here from Guatemala.
She'll be fine."

Let's get started, boys.

06:39.808 --> 06:41.382

be more work

06:41.402 --> 06:43.885
than when I built that Habitat
for Sean Hannity.

made everything white,

06:48.224 --> 06:49.074
from your sodium headaches,

06:49.225 --> 06:50.300
and on the walls, I painted

06:50.318 --> 06:51.726
some of your most famous quotes.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.969
There's the one where
you compared

06:53.062 --> 06:55.730
the homosexual lifestyle
to playing in the sewer,

06:55.824 --> 06:57.474
and there's the one where
you defended Roy Moore.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.175
-Nice.
-Uh-huh.

06:59.177 --> 07:01.586
And here's a room where you can
blame things on an immigrant.

Uh, my name is Lois Griffin,

08:27.733 --> 08:30.900
Uh, I went to the hospital
for a simple surgery

08:30.994 --> 08:32.919
and woke up in the ICU.

08:33.071 --> 08:36.089
But the irony was
I couldn't see you.

08:36.241 --> 08:38.758
I couldn't see anyone
or anything.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.410

08:40.428 --> 08:43.063

the most.

08:45.417 --> 08:48.693
So now I suppose
if I want to see again,

08:48.920 --> 08:50.845
I'll have to listen more

08:50.864 --> 08:53.848
and-and feel more
and focus on

08:53.867 --> 08:58.019

what I can see on the outside.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.825
(whistling)

09:45.977 --> 09:48.478
Excuse me. What happened
to your big trip

09:48.496 --> 09:49.737
to Providence?

09:49.831 --> 09:52.073
Good morning, sports fans.

09:52.167 --> 09:54.834
You ready to witness
the epitome of excellence?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.303
Check this out.

09:57.839 --> 10:00.390
(chuckling):
Oh. Ball one.

10:02.344 --> 10:03.727
(grunts)

10:06.331 --> 10:08.106
Look, spaz,
hold the bat like this,

10:08.333 --> 10:10.692
and then step into it
as you swing forward.

10:14.356 --> 10:16.781
I did it.
Thanks, Mr. Griffin.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.266
-I'm leaving.
-Come on, Chris.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.679
Don't be mad.
My plans changed.

10:22.697 --> 10:23.863
Oh, hey, Doug.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.707
CHRIS:
Are you kidding me?!

10:29.871 --> 10:31.946
Mom, you won't believe
what happened.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.798
Your video went viral.

10:33.950 --> 10:36.617
Oh, does that mean
Circuit City's back?

10:36.637 --> 10:40.697
No, it means your ICU video
really connected with people.

10:40.715 --> 10:43.549
You're helping people
who feel unseen, Mom.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.052
Like me.
You're everywhere.

10:46.204 --> 10:48.054
Okay, so what am I supposed
to do now?

10:48.206 --> 10:49.814
Make another video.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.132
Hi, Lois, I didn't get
a monkey.

10:51.226 --> 10:52.876
Off to see Bananarama. Bye.

10:52.969 --> 10:54.802
♪<i> I'm your Venus...</i> ♪

10:54.821 --> 10:58.198
Well, it's not what I thought
it was gonna be either.

11:01.236 --> 11:03.477
Mom, I made some ICU T-shirts.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.831
What's going on?
Who are these people?

11:07.058 --> 11:08.149
My team.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.410
ICU has exploded.

11:10.562 --> 11:13.171
There's ICU Fashion,
ICU Skincare,

11:13.398 --> 11:16.157
ICU Health.
It is a gold mine.

11:16.251 --> 11:18.067
Okay, but what does any
of this have to do with

11:18.161 --> 11:20.236
seeing people for
who they really are?

11:20.255 --> 11:22.180
Oh, pfft,
who cares about that?

11:22.407 --> 11:25.091
I do. ICU was an idea
I could really believe in,

11:25.185 --> 11:26.685
and you're ruining it.

11:26.912 --> 11:29.429
I'm not ruining it,
I'm expanding it.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.523
You know, I'm the one
who went blind, Meg.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.249
I'm the one who's suffering.

11:33.384 --> 11:35.843
Now the least I can do is
make some money from it.

11:35.937 --> 11:37.270
Now stand back.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.656
It's time to make
another video.

11:41.642 --> 11:44.035
Hello, Seers, Lois here.

11:44.187 --> 11:47.597
You know, sometimes the darkness
gets overwhelming,

11:47.690 --> 11:51.935
and that's when I turn
to ICU Essential Oils.

11:51.953 --> 11:56.047
It calms you before sleep,
or you can cook chicken in it.

11:56.199 --> 12:00.009
(upbeat music playing)

12:10.063 --> 12:11.980
Oh, my God.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.900
I can see.

12:16.052 --> 12:17.402
Oh, God, but if anybody
finds out,

12:17.629 --> 12:19.404
it'll ruin my ICU brand.

12:19.555 --> 12:22.315
Ugh. Peter told me
he'd been doing laundry.

12:22.467 --> 12:25.468
You know, now I'm even wondering
if he lost those 75 pounds

12:25.487 --> 12:26.244
like he said.

12:26.395 --> 12:27.245
PETER:
What's that, Lois?

12:27.396 --> 12:28.913
I'm just on the spin bike.

12:29.065 --> 12:30.397
Got a good sweat going.

12:30.492 --> 12:33.293
Boy, you're right,
Sarah loves those hills.

12:41.410 --> 12:43.653
Okay, here's the microphone.

12:43.671 --> 12:44.821
Yeah, I see it.

12:44.839 --> 12:47.173
I-I mean, oh, thank you.

12:47.325 --> 12:49.100
Uh, i-is that Meg?

12:49.327 --> 12:51.102
Mom, what's going on with you?

12:51.329 --> 12:54.013
Nothing. Especially my eyesight.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.849
I am still very, very blind.

12:57.002 --> 12:59.352
Thank you all
for coming today.

12:59.504 --> 13:02.505
I can't see you,
because I'm blind,

13:02.524 --> 13:03.948
but ICU.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.950
(cheering)

13:06.102 --> 13:09.120
Please be sure to try out
our new colonic partnership

13:09.272 --> 13:11.438
with increasingly irrelevant
rapper Eminem,

13:11.458 --> 13:12.849
the Eminenema.

13:12.984 --> 13:16.352
It promises to clear out
"8 Miles" of mom's spaghetti.

13:16.371 --> 13:19.947
It goes in slim clear

daytime talk show host

13:42.714 --> 13:44.714
who gives millions away
to those in need

13:44.807 --> 13:46.549
and is still somehow loathed?

13:46.642 --> 13:50.644
Well, "loathed" is a little bit
exactly right, but yes.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.313
I'm here, Lois, because
Helen has been

13:52.332 --> 13:55.166
following your success and would
love to make it her own.

13:55.393 --> 13:57.910
Would you consider being
a guest on our show?

13:58.004 --> 14:00.746
Oh, my gosh, really?
That's amazing.

14:00.899 --> 14:02.415
So I get to go to Hollywood?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.083
We actually tape the show
in Burbank.

14:04.235 --> 14:06.845
-Oh. What's the difference?
-(laughs)

14:06.996 --> 14:09.072
That's hilarious.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.240

a lot less money than me

Meg, can you believe it?

14:14.429 --> 14:17.171
This is gonna take ICU global.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.483
I'll be more popular than
a Robert Redford clip.

14:28.535 --> 14:32.111
Hey, guys. My dad made you
another list.

14:32.263 --> 14:34.931
"Teach Doug to ride a bike,
bake cookies,

14:34.949 --> 14:36.374
listen to his Archer
impression."

14:36.601 --> 14:38.284
This is ridiculous.
We're not doing any of this.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.028
I don't know, I kind of want
to hear his Archer impression.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.047
Yeah, I'm curious.

14:43.199 --> 14:47.110
(as Archer):
I'm an international spy,
but I also do mundane things.

14:47.203 --> 14:49.554
Okay, all right.
That's-that's pretty good.

14:49.705 --> 14:50.889
But that's it. No more.

14:51.116 --> 14:54.041
Then I guess my dad
will just have to sue you.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.952
You know what?
Go ahead and sue us.

14:55.970 --> 14:56.953
I mean, look at this guy.

14:56.971 --> 14:58.045

you're gonna get?

14:58.064 --> 15:00.381
We came here in his dog's car.

15:00.475 --> 15:02.049
But we had a deal.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.885
Well, the deal's off.

all that stuff.

15:28.319 --> 15:30.002
Why did you make us
do all that stuff
