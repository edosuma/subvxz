WEBVTT

00:18.600 --> 00:20.762
Good evening, Mr. Hill.
How you doing?

01:25.166 --> 01:27.157
What the...?

01:27.368 --> 01:28.995
Anomaly in the room.

01:29.170 --> 01:30.729
Deeks hard at work.

01:30.905 --> 01:32.703
- Deeks not talking.
- Interesting.

01:32.874 --> 01:34.740
Mm-hm. Very interesting.

01:34.909 --> 01:39.039
Interesting? No, no.
I'm, uh, not interesting.

01:39.547 --> 01:41.743
Now, that's interesting.

01:42.183 --> 01:43.344
Don't mind us, Deeks.

01:46.721 --> 01:49.053
- Won't make eye contact.
- Elevated heart rate.

01:49.224 --> 01:51.215
Fidgety, not from the coffee.

01:51.392 --> 01:53.486
Sweaty,
and it's not from the climate.

01:53.661 --> 01:55.425
- Come on, guys.
- Defensive.

01:55.597 --> 01:59.261
I just... I think that maybe the coffee
is just stronger today.

01:59.434 --> 02:00.697
Changing the subject.

02:00.868 --> 02:04.395
And he's got some dark rings
under his eyes.

02:04.806 --> 02:06.240
Morning.

02:06.407 --> 02:07.738
Your partner's acting weird.

02:07.909 --> 02:09.877
- My partner is weird.
- She has a point.

02:11.613 --> 02:12.876
Oh, he's unresponsive.

02:13.047 --> 02:15.778
Creative avoidance.
What do you think?

02:17.986 --> 02:19.852
Isn't that the same shirt you had on
yesterday?

02:22.690 --> 02:25.716
Wow, this is a first.

02:25.893 --> 02:27.554
Neither of you have anything to say.

02:27.729 --> 02:28.753
No, no, I...

02:30.932 --> 02:33.629
Case on deck, quick briefing,
and then our day gets tactical.

02:38.172 --> 02:39.298
- Go ahead.
- No, go ahead.

02:39.474 --> 02:40.771
- Sorry.
- You should go first,

02:40.942 --> 02:43.172
- we should go to Ops separately.
- Okay.

02:43.344 --> 02:46.871
No. No.

02:48.016 --> 02:49.745
No.

03:01.496 --> 03:03.089
A penny for your thoughts.

03:03.264 --> 03:04.493
Price has gone up.

03:05.366 --> 03:07.300
There's no discount
for shared history?

03:07.468 --> 03:09.266
No. No discount for you

03:09.437 --> 03:13.897
because you're one of the few
who understand the cost.

03:14.075 --> 03:15.304
That sounds like a compliment.

03:15.476 --> 03:17.069
Or a curse.

03:22.183 --> 03:24.311
Something else has come up.

03:24.485 --> 03:26.510
You're not gonna like it.

03:30.224 --> 03:32.124
Don't shoot the messenger.

03:33.161 --> 03:35.892
It was only a matter of time.

03:40.268 --> 03:43.294
Twenty-four hours ago,
a Pentagon consultant named Ron Hill

03:43.471 --> 03:46.270
was murdered at the
Naval Central Command in Bahrain.

03:46.441 --> 03:49.376
He created contingencies for
Joint Special Operations Command.

03:49.544 --> 03:52.138
The art of gaming
unpredictable global events.

03:52.313 --> 03:55.749
And he was about to deliver a plan
for seizing Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.077
If a coup happens,
the United States wants to make sure

03:58.219 --> 04:00.051
those WMDs don't fall
in the wrong hands.

04:00.221 --> 04:02.713
Problem is,
contingency plans cut both ways.

04:02.890 --> 04:05.450
For us, it's a solution.
For the other side, it's an opportunity.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.925
The plan to secure Pakistan's nukes

04:08.096 --> 04:10.087
could also be exploited
as a plan to steal them.

04:10.264 --> 04:12.562
Hill transferred the plan
to a thumb drive.

04:12.734 --> 04:15.294
It was the only copy,
impossible to duplicate.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.495
Lot of buyers in black market
for intel like that.

04:17.672 --> 04:18.867
Lot of murder suspects too.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.132
Killer knew his blade.

04:20.308 --> 04:22.174
Taking a head with one cut
takes skill.

04:22.343 --> 04:23.833
I've been to that base in Bahrain.

04:24.011 --> 04:26.241
- Gurkhas pull security there.
- Gerka what? Who?

04:26.414 --> 04:29.213
Commandos recruited from the
mountains of Nepal at age 14.

04:29.384 --> 04:31.352
Hand them a gun,
they'll tear up a shooting range.

04:31.519 --> 04:33.839
Hand them a knife,
wipe out an entire city without a noise.

04:33.988 --> 04:36.348
They're good with any blade,
but they made the kukri famous.

04:36.491 --> 04:37.652
They're legendary.

04:37.825 --> 04:40.920
The average Gurkha's
about 5'4", 125 pounds,

04:41.095 --> 04:43.295
and rumor has it,
they stacked more kills in Afghanistan

04:43.431 --> 04:46.025
than anyone else,
except for America and England.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.692
Nothing brings out your inner fangirl
like a guy with a knife.

04:48.870 --> 04:52.431
Security detail in Bahrain on the night
of Hill's murder were, in fact, Gurkhas

04:52.607 --> 04:53.647
on loan from India's army.

04:53.808 --> 04:55.768
They claim they're being framed
for Hill's murder.

04:55.910 --> 04:57.400
Eric, you said we were
going tactical?

04:57.578 --> 04:59.410
Homing beacon planted
inside the thumb drive

04:59.580 --> 05:01.844
shows that it's now located
in this Hollywood hotel.

05:02.316 --> 05:03.784
And what if we're fighting Gurkhas?

05:04.452 --> 05:05.851
Protect your neck.

05:10.324 --> 05:11.792
We're on the second floor.

05:12.326 --> 05:13.885
Room 255.

05:14.061 --> 05:16.462
A GPS beacon's accurate
to ten feet.

05:16.631 --> 05:19.151
Thumb drive's either in that room,
or the one directly below it.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.234
Approaching Room 155.

05:24.172 --> 05:25.196
Ready to breach.

05:25.373 --> 05:26.772
On my count.

05:26.941 --> 05:28.841
Three, two, one.

05:31.946 --> 05:32.970
Federal agents!

05:36.284 --> 05:37.308
Clear.

05:37.485 --> 05:38.611
Clear.

05:40.588 --> 05:41.749
Kens!

05:50.798 --> 05:51.822
You good?

05:51.999 --> 05:54.229
Got an active shooter in the north lot.
We're moving.

05:54.402 --> 05:55.892
- Split up, cut him off.
- Check.

06:10.451 --> 06:13.250
Deeks, Kensi,
one hostile down in the hallway.

06:16.491 --> 06:17.617
No thumb drive.

06:24.632 --> 06:26.327
Hey, are you okay?

06:28.469 --> 06:30.403
- Yeah? What's your name?
- Maddie.

06:30.571 --> 06:32.630
- Maddie? All right, look...
- Drop your weapons.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.505
It's okay.

06:40.681 --> 06:42.706
You're gonna be fine, Maddie.
Okay?

06:43.618 --> 06:45.484
Nice knife.

06:46.454 --> 06:48.183
Please let the girl go.

06:48.356 --> 06:49.380
Get out of here.

06:50.291 --> 06:52.453
Run. Run!

06:52.627 --> 06:54.356
- Kensi?
- Deeks!

06:58.065 --> 07:00.295
Move, and I'll empty her guts
all over the pavement.

07:01.702 --> 07:02.999
Take the shot.

07:06.073 --> 07:08.235
- Drop it!
- Take the shot.

07:08.409 --> 07:11.037
- Come on, let's go!
- Send it.

07:11.212 --> 07:12.543
Get in.

07:21.656 --> 07:24.785
You okay? I didn't have a shot.

07:28.462 --> 07:29.861
Hey.

07:33.334 --> 07:34.699
Listen, I didn't have a shot.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.512
I didn't have a shot.

08:07.333 --> 08:08.391
Thumb drive?

08:08.568 --> 08:11.230
GPS beacon's down. They must have
figured out how we tracked them.

08:11.771 --> 08:15.401
- They weren't Gurkhas.
- Too big, too loud, no finesse.

08:15.575 --> 08:16.633
They were Pakistani.

08:17.644 --> 08:18.668
The shooter you took down

08:18.845 --> 08:22.679
was an Inter-Services Intelligence
agent working under non-official cover.

08:22.849 --> 08:25.011
Gurkhas serve in the Indian military.

08:25.185 --> 08:28.155
Pakistan and India are rivals
who share a border.

08:28.321 --> 08:30.449
There's a lot of history there.
Lot of hate.

08:30.623 --> 08:33.649
Hill drew up the plan
to seize the Pakistani nukes.

08:33.827 --> 08:35.955
They'd love to make sure
it never got out.

08:36.863 --> 08:38.092
Well, stealing a thumb drive

08:38.264 --> 08:40.664
and framing your worst enemy
for murder,

08:40.967 --> 08:43.129
it's a pretty bold move.

08:43.503 --> 08:45.164
Thoughts?

08:45.839 --> 08:48.831
It's consistent with our profile
of the Pakistani spy agency's mindset.

08:49.008 --> 08:50.032
Agreed.

08:51.678 --> 08:53.271
Excuse me.

08:56.015 --> 08:57.710
I'll be right back.

09:03.857 --> 09:05.825
- Something we should know?
- Yeah.

09:07.327 --> 09:10.661
Two more ISI agents are on the loose
and they have the thumb drive.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.389
Find them.

09:12.565 --> 09:13.999
Okay.

09:36.122 --> 09:38.242
Twenty-four hours ago,
you would have taken that shot.

09:38.391 --> 09:40.689
- I didn't have the shot.
- Yes, you did.

09:45.198 --> 09:46.927
Okay, yesterday I would have
taken the shot,

09:47.100 --> 09:50.161
but it's not yesterday anymore, is it?

09:52.839 --> 09:54.432
Is it?

09:56.609 --> 09:58.338
What happened out there?

09:58.811 --> 10:00.870
Same thing that happens
every time we go kinetic.

10:01.047 --> 10:03.345
Variables got in the way
and decisions were made.

10:03.783 --> 10:06.548
We ran our after-action debrief
and we're moving forward.

10:06.719 --> 10:09.745
But the variables are still out there,
Mr. Hanna.

10:09.923 --> 10:11.322
We'll recover the thumb drive.

10:11.491 --> 10:14.552
The thumb drive
is not what I'm referring to.

10:15.128 --> 10:18.223
Is your team mission-ready?

10:20.166 --> 10:21.429
I hope so.

10:22.101 --> 10:25.799
Well, hope is not a plan, Mr. Callen.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.984
Okay. I should have taken the shot,

10:41.154 --> 10:44.715
and I let my emotions get in the way,
and I'm sorry.

10:44.891 --> 10:47.292
I'm honestly just trying
to make this work.

10:47.727 --> 10:49.388
It's not going to work.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.495
I'm standing on my frozen lake.

10:56.235 --> 10:57.760
I don't know what that means.

10:58.371 --> 11:00.635
It's something that I learned
in Sayoc.

11:02.075 --> 11:06.273
Your frozen lake is the name for
what you want the most in the world,

11:06.446 --> 11:07.572
and you want it...

11:07.747 --> 11:12.344
You want it so bad
that you'll do anything to get it,

11:12.819 --> 11:14.913
and your heart takes over.

11:16.923 --> 11:21.485
But because of that,
it destroys you in the end.

11:22.929 --> 11:26.365
It's right there, just sitting
in the middle of this frozen lake

11:26.532 --> 11:28.591
and you think you're fast enough
to go out there

11:28.768 --> 11:30.532
and grab it before the ice cracks.

11:30.703 --> 11:33.104
And what you don't realize is

11:33.272 --> 11:36.139
you're already standing on the ice
and it's falling apart around you.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.708
Um, L.A.P.D. just found a body.

11:42.882 --> 11:45.214
One of the shooters from the hotel.

11:46.652 --> 11:48.120
Good.

12:02.935 --> 12:05.632
Second-to-last ISI agent.

12:05.838 --> 12:07.499
One cut, one kill.

12:08.741 --> 12:09.799
What did L.A.P.D. say?

12:09.976 --> 12:12.536
They didn't find the thumb drive.
The last shooter's in the wind.

12:12.678 --> 12:13.975
Well, they were on the run.

12:14.147 --> 12:15.842
Could've had a disagreement
that escalated.

12:16.015 --> 12:18.535
But they had guns. If it escalated,
why mess around with knives?

12:18.684 --> 12:19.947
Why not just shoot someone?

12:20.119 --> 12:23.054
Maybe it wasn't a disagreement.
Maybe it was an ambush.

12:23.523 --> 12:25.243
An ambush by someone
who doesn't take kindly

12:25.391 --> 12:27.257
to being framed
for murder and espionage.

12:28.661 --> 12:30.151
Yeah.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.055
Maybe he's closer than we think.

12:35.034 --> 12:37.366
- Sam?
- Yup.

12:38.971 --> 12:40.939
Watch for the blade.

12:41.107 --> 12:43.201
Bring a knife to a gunfight,
he'll see what happens.

12:45.011 --> 12:46.775
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

13:04.964 --> 13:06.557
No shot!

13:29.255 --> 13:32.316
What was that I said
about bringing a knife to a gunfight?

13:35.628 --> 13:36.652
No thumb drive.

13:37.530 --> 13:38.554
Who are you?

13:38.731 --> 13:42.395
Jemadar Thapa,
5th Gurkha Rifle Regiment,

13:42.869 --> 13:44.997
Frontier Force.

13:49.275 --> 13:51.972
"Victory to the goddess Kali,

13:52.512 --> 13:54.105
the Gurkhas are coming."

13:54.780 --> 13:56.270
It's their war cry.

14:10.261 --> 14:12.195
If a man tells you he's not afraid to die,

14:12.364 --> 14:14.799
he's either lying or he's a Gurkha.

14:14.966 --> 14:17.264
I take it you've heard that one, huh?

14:17.435 --> 14:19.062
From the man who said it first,

14:19.237 --> 14:21.365
the late Field Marshal
Sam Manekshaw,

14:21.539 --> 14:24.099
Indian army chief of staff,
my mentor.

14:24.275 --> 14:27.472
Mm. Would he approve
of you committing murder?

14:27.645 --> 14:30.512
Not to mention attacking
two federal agents on American soil?

14:30.682 --> 14:34.175
India's Ministry of Defence sent me
here to clear the Gurkha name.

14:34.853 --> 14:35.911
Then why did you run?

14:37.021 --> 14:39.183
I did not want to waste time
playing diplomat

14:39.357 --> 14:42.122
while a Pakistani spy is on the run
with sensitive intel.

14:42.293 --> 14:44.733
If we wanted to waste your time,
you'd be in prison right now.

14:44.863 --> 14:49.323
And for the record,
that sensitive intel is U.S. property.

14:50.468 --> 14:52.368
The intel is not my concern.

14:52.537 --> 14:55.063
No, your concern is revenge.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.537
I call it honor.

14:56.708 --> 14:57.766
Honor?

14:59.577 --> 15:01.773
Is that really
the only reason you're here, Thapa?

15:03.848 --> 15:06.909
I carry out my orders.
No more, no less.

15:07.085 --> 15:09.281
Yeah, but that thumb drive's
pretty tempting, isn't it?

15:12.090 --> 15:15.424
An operational plan
to seize Pakistan's nukes,

15:15.593 --> 15:19.530
to make the looming threat
against your country disappear forever.

15:19.697 --> 15:22.530
Maybe your command didn't tell you
to bring it back,

15:23.968 --> 15:26.266
but you'd get a hero's welcome
if you did.

15:26.938 --> 15:29.100
Let's say you got your hands
on the thumb drive.

15:30.508 --> 15:33.478
You tell me you're just gonna hand it
over to us and walk away?

15:37.482 --> 15:39.642
No way he's giving up this thumb drive
without a fight.

15:39.784 --> 15:41.343
Pentagon says
that Thapa checks out,

15:41.519 --> 15:43.817
which means
he's officially on our side.

15:43.988 --> 15:46.514
Well, he's got a wife and three kids
in West Bengal.

15:46.691 --> 15:48.291
A strike by Pakistan
would wipe them out.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.554
Think he's gonna give up a shot
at keeping them safe?

15:50.929 --> 15:53.455
If he can control his emotions.

15:56.067 --> 15:57.728
A lot easier said than done.

15:57.902 --> 16:00.928
Well, it's never easy
when you start to care.

16:01.806 --> 16:05.003
I guess this makes the thumb drive
his frozen lake?

16:07.345 --> 16:09.177
Guess it does.

16:13.751 --> 16:15.776
He'll do the right thing.

16:20.492 --> 16:23.257
The White Ghost
is a dangerous and elusive man.

16:23.628 --> 16:25.824
This is not an easy mission, Owen.

16:25.997 --> 16:28.728
Which is why I'm running it myself.

16:29.868 --> 16:32.166
You're going to need a QRF.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.430
I'll keep my team on standby.

16:35.607 --> 16:38.804
You've got your hands full right here,
Henrietta, but I do appreciate the offer.

16:41.145 --> 16:44.206
It seems the years
have made you kind.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.415
Have they?

16:50.955 --> 16:52.286
Looking for the last shooter,

16:52.457 --> 16:54.858
but given his countersurveillance
training, it's a long shot.

16:55.026 --> 16:57.946
Wait, what about the getaway car
from the hotel? It still hasn't shown up.

16:58.096 --> 17:00.136
I've got Kaleidoscope searching
that make and model.

17:00.298 --> 17:02.289
Well, all we can do is wait.

17:06.637 --> 17:08.518
- I think...
- I don't wanna know what you think

17:08.640 --> 17:09.664
about Kensi and Deeks.

17:10.040 --> 17:11.372
I didn't say what I was thinking.

17:11.542 --> 17:13.136
But I know what you're thinking.

17:13.411 --> 17:14.640
So you're thinking it too?

17:17.382 --> 17:19.373
You think Hetty knows?

17:20.285 --> 17:21.980
Hetty knows everything, I think.

17:22.153 --> 17:23.211
That's what I thought.

17:25.757 --> 17:28.124
- Private airstrip.
- Huh?

17:28.292 --> 17:30.455
The last shooter,
he needs to leave the country,

17:30.628 --> 17:32.494
but he's trained
to avoid major hubs like LAX

17:32.664 --> 17:35.031
because he knows
that's where we would be looking.

17:35.199 --> 17:38.032
Okay, but Kaleidoscope already
searched private airstrip parking lots.

17:39.037 --> 17:41.836
Search major parking lots
around the parking lots

17:42.006 --> 17:44.373
in a five-mile radius.

17:49.614 --> 17:50.911
Sedan matching that description

17:51.082 --> 17:52.948
two miles from Whiteman Airport
in Pacoima.

17:53.117 --> 17:55.415
Yep, makes sense.
It's small, not a major hub.

17:55.587 --> 17:57.919
- I'll tell the others.
- Get me Agent Callen.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.984
Understood, Hetty.

18:04.829 --> 18:06.695
We got a change of plans.

18:06.864 --> 18:08.559
Thapa's coming with us
to the airstrip.

18:08.733 --> 18:10.963
- It's a bad idea.
- Yeah, probably.

18:11.536 --> 18:13.971
SECNAYV wants us to treat him
like a member of the team.

18:14.539 --> 18:16.473
She's hoping to bolster relations
with India.

18:16.641 --> 18:19.303
SECNAV never had
this little dude's knife to her throat.

18:19.844 --> 18:21.573
I'll get Thapa a gun from the armory.

18:21.746 --> 18:25.808
No. Deeks, handle his stuff. Kensi,
you're coming with Sam and me.

18:25.984 --> 18:27.145
Wh...?

18:28.286 --> 18:29.913
You two could use some space.

18:32.056 --> 18:33.751
Understood.

18:37.729 --> 18:38.821
You got this?

18:39.697 --> 18:41.529
I got this.

18:54.212 --> 18:57.204
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

18:57.382 --> 18:59.282
Well, your enthusiasm
is overwhelming.

19:00.418 --> 19:01.977
I prefer to work alone.

19:02.687 --> 19:04.086
I used to feel the same way.

19:05.156 --> 19:07.989
- What changed?
- I found somebody worth trusting.

19:08.159 --> 19:09.820
And your team trusts me?

19:10.161 --> 19:13.461
I can't really speak for my team,
but, uh...

19:16.768 --> 19:17.792
I do.

19:20.405 --> 19:21.839
Why?

19:23.307 --> 19:25.401
It's a damn good question.

19:26.210 --> 19:28.269
I understand
that you want the thumb drive.

19:28.446 --> 19:30.406
I get that,
because if I was you, I'd want it too.

19:30.548 --> 19:33.643
And for this mission,
that makes you a liability.

19:34.252 --> 19:36.311
But you got this.

19:36.654 --> 19:37.951
You believe I can do it?

19:38.122 --> 19:40.250
That my brain
will win over my heart?

19:40.425 --> 19:43.122
Brother, I gotta believe that,
because if you can do it, so can I.

19:44.495 --> 19:47.726
Jemadar Thapa,
5th Gurkha Rifle Regiment.

19:47.899 --> 19:48.957
Frontier Force.

19:49.133 --> 19:50.999
Detective Marty Deeks. L.A.P.D.

19:52.336 --> 19:56.466
The Gurkhas have a saying,
"Better to die than be a coward."

19:56.841 --> 20:01.039
Wow, I think my regular partner
was a Gurkha in a past life.

20:01.212 --> 20:03.544
- Then he must be brave.
- Well, she...

20:05.283 --> 20:06.751
She's the bravest.

20:07.051 --> 20:09.179
I will not let you down, sahib.

20:11.656 --> 20:13.249
Okay.

20:18.629 --> 20:20.859
The Pakistani's a trained pilot.

20:21.032 --> 20:23.433
All he's gonna need is a plane.

20:27.405 --> 20:30.306
- You got a good wind?
- Yeah.

20:30.908 --> 20:33.502
- Got yourself a nice angle?
- Yep.

20:34.679 --> 20:39.173
- Still automatic from 1,500 yards?
- Yep.

20:47.525 --> 20:50.324
Loves to open up about her feelings,
doesn't she?

20:52.263 --> 20:54.891
- So you've never had a partner?
- No.

20:55.500 --> 20:58.765
- There's no female Gurkhas?
- No.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.766
Well, you should consider yourself
lucky then.

21:01.939 --> 21:04.374
I mean, look at me,
I'm standing on a frozen lake.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.944
And I'm beginning to sound like her.

21:08.112 --> 21:09.807
The heart needs discipline.

21:10.248 --> 21:13.309
Without discipline,
there is no honor.

21:13.484 --> 21:16.215
Without honor, we are nothing.

21:17.421 --> 21:19.082
You know what,
you're pretty cool, Thapa.

21:19.257 --> 21:22.056
For a second there, I forgot
that you chopped off some guy's head.

21:22.226 --> 21:24.991
There is only one way
to cross a frozen lake.

21:26.197 --> 21:27.926
The ISI agent
has reached the airstrip.

21:28.099 --> 21:29.396
He's alone and on foot.

21:35.106 --> 21:37.575
Stand by, Deeks.
Looks like he's meeting somebody.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.075
He'll never make it back to Pakistan.

21:40.244 --> 21:42.713
His passport has been tagged.
He will be caught.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.077
Armenian Mob in Glendale
has the best forgery operation in L.A.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.651
Fake passport
would've been his first stop for sure.

21:48.820 --> 21:49.981
It does not matter.

21:50.154 --> 21:51.644
- He is a dead man.
- No. No, no.

21:51.823 --> 21:54.588
No dead man. We need him alive,
tie up loose ends, you got that?

21:54.759 --> 21:55.783
Got it, sahib.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.826
The moment you see that thumb drive,
move in.

21:58.296 --> 22:00.264
Agent just passed an envelope.

22:00.431 --> 22:02.263
I think it was money.

22:04.368 --> 22:07.804
Some sort of keys.
No thumb drive visible.

22:07.972 --> 22:09.440
No. Thapa.

22:09.607 --> 22:11.006
Deeks, move.

22:11.175 --> 22:13.473
Federal agents! Drop it!

22:15.613 --> 22:16.774
- Hold overwatch.
- Check.

22:40.438 --> 22:42.566
- Thapa's MIA.
- Eric?

22:42.740 --> 22:44.401
Scanning airstrip cams now.

23:02.460 --> 23:03.791
Kensi? The Gurkha?

23:03.961 --> 23:05.690
No visual on Thapa.

23:10.935 --> 23:12.596
Damn it.

23:18.009 --> 23:19.943
No, no.

23:21.212 --> 23:22.702
Thumb drive's gone.

23:44.567 --> 23:46.001
Let me guess. You got bad news

23:46.169 --> 23:49.070
and then you got "Fredo at the end
of Godfather: Part II” bad news.

23:49.806 --> 23:51.240
Awesome.
Give me the bad news first.

23:51.407 --> 23:53.739
The news isn't good,
but I'm not a messenger, Deeks.

23:53.910 --> 23:55.430
You're the guy
that gives the pep talk?

23:55.578 --> 23:57.842
I'm the one that reminds you
you're not in this alone.

23:58.014 --> 24:00.915
Here's the bad news.
What happened was the Pakistanis

24:01.084 --> 24:02.848
found a plane owner online
earlier today,

24:03.786 --> 24:05.151
offered him cash for a ride.

24:05.321 --> 24:07.415
The owner had no idea
what he'd gotten himself into.

24:07.590 --> 24:09.524
Dead the moment he stepped
on the tarmac.

24:10.193 --> 24:11.820
Okay. Give me Fredo.

24:11.995 --> 24:15.295
- Thapa's in the wind. No trace of him.
- Right.

24:15.465 --> 24:16.990
Eric's searching cam footage,

24:17.167 --> 24:19.761
statewide APB,
FBI K-9 units are en route.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.696
You think that's enough
to hunt down a Gurkha

24:21.838 --> 24:23.363
carrying the holy grail of intel?

24:23.540 --> 24:25.440
His credit cards and bank accounts
are frozen.

24:25.608 --> 24:28.509
Indian government disavowed him
for violating direct orders.

24:29.279 --> 24:31.270
This is an international incident.

24:31.814 --> 24:33.509
Thapa's the most wanted man
in L.A.

24:33.683 --> 24:35.283
I know.
And I'm the one that trusted him.

24:35.451 --> 24:36.811
Maybe you didn't hear me just now.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.887
No, I did. I'm not alone. I got it.

24:39.923 --> 24:41.687
Listen, uh, just for the record,

24:41.858 --> 24:43.826
Kensi told me
to take that shot at the hotel.

24:44.460 --> 24:45.825
I've made that shot before.

24:45.995 --> 24:48.435
I've been there, done that,
got the T-shirt, I didn't take it.

24:48.565 --> 24:49.726
So get us back in the game.

24:53.870 --> 24:56.202
I know a way to find Thapa
and get the thumb drive back.

24:56.372 --> 24:58.238
Something tells me
you know something we don't.

24:59.175 --> 25:00.734
Crazy, right?

25:08.418 --> 25:10.682
Hetty, I can make this right.

25:11.187 --> 25:13.212
You have several problems,
Mr. Deeks.

25:13.389 --> 25:15.653
Which one are we talking about?

25:17.360 --> 25:19.680
I'm talking about the Gurkha.
I have a plan for the Gurkha.

25:21.297 --> 25:24.164
I'm sure it's brilliant. Tell me.

25:24.334 --> 25:26.826
I honestly don't think
that this guy's gonna go rogue

25:27.003 --> 25:29.529
and sell the thumb drive
to the highest bidder.

25:29.706 --> 25:32.403
I mean, think about this.
He's a... He's a patriot, he's a soldier,

25:32.575 --> 25:35.010
and if he brings home the information
to neutralize Pakistan,

25:35.178 --> 25:37.138
there's a good chance
India's gonna take him back.

25:38.948 --> 25:41.645
Always better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

25:41.818 --> 25:46.085
Exactly. So, what's his next step?
He's gotta get out of Los Angeles,

25:46.256 --> 25:48.748
which means he needs a new
passport, he needs a new identity

25:48.925 --> 25:50.984
and, given the heat on him,
it's gotta be perfect.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.391
That's a large task, Mr. Deeks.

25:54.564 --> 25:56.328
Thapa's a stranger in this city.

25:56.499 --> 25:58.092
How would he know where to go?

25:58.568 --> 25:59.933
Because I told him.

26:01.271 --> 26:06.732
1, uh, mentioned the Armenian Mob
franchise in Glendale.

26:06.909 --> 26:09.207
It's run by a woman
named Talita Pambakian.

26:09.545 --> 26:11.240
You know her location?

26:11.414 --> 26:13.883
I spent two weeks
infiltrating her group,

26:14.050 --> 26:15.950
working undercover for L.A.P.D.

26:16.119 --> 26:18.645
We established contact.
She thinks I'm a lawyer.

26:18.821 --> 26:20.289
And what happened?

26:22.058 --> 26:24.288
She found out there was another cop
working undercover

26:24.460 --> 26:25.620
and she shot him in the head.

26:28.431 --> 26:32.299
Obviously, L.A.P.D. shut it down
and then they pulled me out.

26:33.503 --> 26:36.905
And you want to reestablish contact.

26:37.073 --> 26:40.099
Thapa's on his way to see her right
now. All I gotta do is beat him there.

26:43.246 --> 26:45.214
You need a suit.

26:50.653 --> 26:52.985
- Hetty brief you?
- Yeah.

26:53.156 --> 26:56.148
We assessed the location in Ops
and, honestly, I don't like it.

26:56.626 --> 26:58.866
Makes it impossible to reach you
if something goes wrong.

26:59.028 --> 27:01.759
Not much of a choice.
It's the only way.

27:02.565 --> 27:06.433
Or you mean the only way to redeem
yourself for the hotel and Thapa?

27:10.673 --> 27:13.165
Can you do something for me?

27:13.609 --> 27:15.043
What?

27:16.145 --> 27:19.012
Can you, for a second,
just pretend that I'm not Deeks

27:19.882 --> 27:21.782
and, for a second,
pretend that you're not Kensi

27:21.951 --> 27:24.784
and that we're not partners
and no one's trying to save the planet?

27:25.088 --> 27:26.419
Can we pretend for a second

27:26.589 --> 27:29.183
that we're just a boy and a girl
who are hanging out?

27:30.660 --> 27:33.129
We can drive around
in my pickup truck,

27:33.296 --> 27:35.128
go get ice cream, go bowling.

27:38.267 --> 27:41.328
But that's the thing
because the possibilities are endless.

27:42.372 --> 27:44.170
We're young.

27:44.340 --> 27:46.536
We have all the time in the world.

27:53.716 --> 27:55.480
My name is Fern. Hi.

27:56.819 --> 27:57.843
You're Fern.

27:59.522 --> 28:02.253
Well, so nice to...
So nice to meet you, Fern. I'm Max.

28:02.692 --> 28:03.818
Nice to meet you.

28:03.993 --> 28:05.552
You have any plans for tonight?

28:05.728 --> 28:06.968
I don't know. It's complicated.

28:07.096 --> 28:08.928
Well, not from where I'm standing,
it's not.

28:09.098 --> 28:11.533
- I have a boyfriend.
- So does my girlfriend.

28:12.235 --> 28:14.602
- That's a nice suit.
- Yeah.

28:15.805 --> 28:17.933
The problem with it
is that's it's too tight.

28:18.107 --> 28:19.768
It's gonna be hard
to conceal a weapon.

28:20.209 --> 28:23.201
The first thing Talita's guys
are gonna do are pat me down.

28:23.379 --> 28:25.074
They're gonna find it anyway.

28:30.319 --> 28:31.514
Here.

28:33.923 --> 28:35.220
No, I can't take that.

28:35.391 --> 28:37.416
My partner doesn't go unarmed.

28:37.593 --> 28:38.685
Take it.

28:43.966 --> 28:47.163
I've never had a girl
give me her, uh, knife before.

28:47.336 --> 28:50.237
Does that mean that we are official?

28:54.210 --> 28:56.406
Sometimes a knife is just a knife.

29:06.055 --> 29:07.352
Take us through it, Eric.

29:07.523 --> 29:09.958
Those walls are concrete.
Thick concrete.

29:10.326 --> 29:13.193
The structural integrity's sound,
only way in is through the front door.

29:13.362 --> 29:16.297
There are the two guards out front,
probably more inside we can't see.

29:16.466 --> 29:18.366
Where's Talita located?

29:18.534 --> 29:21.902
Uh, schematics show an office
in the back of the building,

29:22.071 --> 29:24.802
but you'll have to make it
through a narrow hallway to get there.

29:25.308 --> 29:26.434
Fatal funnel.

29:26.809 --> 29:28.743
- Strategic nightmare.
- Yeah.

29:36.919 --> 29:39.650
- Comm's good?
- Loud and clear.

29:54.103 --> 29:55.195
Here to see Talita.

29:55.371 --> 29:56.566
You got an appointment?

29:56.739 --> 29:59.037
Tell her Marty Finch is here
to see her.

29:59.208 --> 30:02.439
Maybe you're a cop, Marty Finch.
Call her lawyer.

30:02.612 --> 30:04.842
Well, that's perfect timing
because I am her lawyer.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.483
Guy named Marty Finch is here.

30:09.652 --> 30:10.983
Send him back.

30:11.153 --> 30:12.518
Yeah.

30:13.189 --> 30:14.315
He's good.

30:14.490 --> 30:16.083
Let's go.

30:22.365 --> 30:24.299
First door on the right.

30:29.839 --> 30:34.276
You're the guy who made those
narco charges go away back in '09?

30:36.312 --> 30:38.246
Hand over any weapons now.

30:38.414 --> 30:40.576
I'm not carrying.

30:40.850 --> 30:42.944
Look for a wire too.

30:43.119 --> 30:45.178
Comms deadzone in that sector
of the building, guys.

30:45.354 --> 30:46.549
My hands are tied.

30:48.291 --> 30:49.918
Then we wait.

30:50.092 --> 30:51.582
You good?

30:54.697 --> 30:56.290
I'm good.

31:06.642 --> 31:07.666
You enjoying yourself?

31:09.278 --> 31:10.404
He's clean.

31:17.053 --> 31:18.851
Back from the dead, counselor?

31:19.622 --> 31:23.149
Not dead, Talita,
just incredibly busy.

31:23.793 --> 31:27.696
If you're not working for me,
it's all the same.

31:28.064 --> 31:29.532
Let's hear your pitch.

31:29.699 --> 31:31.793
You've come to peddle your wares,
right?

31:31.968 --> 31:35.131
Is this the part where I tell you you still
look good and business is thriving?

31:35.972 --> 31:37.701
Only problem is I don't lie to clients.

31:38.140 --> 31:39.733
You're screwed, Talita.

31:39.909 --> 31:41.707
L.A.P.D.'s coming for you.

31:41.877 --> 31:44.710
They know what happens when
undercovers show up at my door.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.406
And unfortunately for you,
they don't forget.

31:47.583 --> 31:50.075
My source says you have another one
coming your way right now.

31:50.252 --> 31:53.984
Small guy, maybe 5'5", dark skin
with an undercover story

31:54.156 --> 31:56.921
about needing forged papers
to get back to India.

31:57.893 --> 31:59.418
I'm waiting, Finch.

31:59.595 --> 32:02.394
What are you talking about?
Waiting for what? That was pro bono.

32:02.565 --> 32:05.227
Do I still look good or not?

32:06.135 --> 32:08.126
I lied before.

32:08.938 --> 32:10.167
You still look good.

32:10.339 --> 32:12.273
What do you want?

32:12.441 --> 32:14.500
You got a lot of meatheads
carrying guns,

32:14.677 --> 32:17.237
but you don't have anybody
that can restructure your organization

32:17.380 --> 32:21.339
and make it legit.
That, Talita, is what I want.

32:21.517 --> 32:22.746
Still billing the same rate?

32:22.918 --> 32:24.443
No, no. Big-boy rules now.

32:24.620 --> 32:26.486
No more retainers.
I need a percentage.

32:26.656 --> 32:28.954
- Big-boy rules?
- Yeah.

32:29.125 --> 32:30.149
I like that.

32:36.632 --> 32:38.293
- Easy on the suit.
- Get up.

32:39.135 --> 32:41.832
You see,
I don't like the one-and-done thing

32:42.004 --> 32:44.302
that you pulled back in '09.

32:44.874 --> 32:46.035
Make things right.

32:46.742 --> 32:48.210
Show me you're loyal.

32:49.111 --> 32:50.408
What are you talking about?

32:50.579 --> 32:54.982
There's a seat for you
at my big-boy table.

32:55.151 --> 32:56.619
But you gotta take it.

32:57.319 --> 32:58.980
Show him.

33:15.271 --> 33:17.603
Your source was right.

33:17.773 --> 33:21.209
This guy showed up,
said he needed clean ID fast.

33:21.377 --> 33:25.245
But if he's a cop,
how come when we shook him down,

33:25.414 --> 33:27.508
all we found was a thumb drive?

33:29.251 --> 33:31.310
I don't know anything
about a thumb drive.

33:31.487 --> 33:35.219
Now that I have it,
I don't need him, do I?

33:37.860 --> 33:39.658
Prove your loyalty.

33:41.363 --> 33:43.092
Take it.

33:48.104 --> 33:52.166
Little man here forgot
there's no honor among thieves.

33:56.912 --> 33:58.277
He's been dark for a while.

33:58.581 --> 34:00.379
We knew
this building had problems.

34:03.018 --> 34:04.498
Listen, Talita, I don't shoot people.

34:04.653 --> 34:05.916
Maybe not for a living,

34:06.088 --> 34:08.181
but anyone can stand
before a beaten man

34:08.357 --> 34:09.518
and pull a trigger.

34:10.359 --> 34:12.589
I only put one bullet in that gun.

34:13.596 --> 34:15.563
Don't miss.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.228
Now, Finch,

34:19.802 --> 34:23.431
or we're going to have two bodies
hanging from hooks.

34:55.636 --> 34:57.627
- Eric?
- The signal's on full boost.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.170
There's nothing we can do.

34:59.574 --> 35:01.668
Lots of guns inside that place.

35:01.843 --> 35:03.436
We go in, we're going in big.

35:03.611 --> 35:05.602
Let's let it play out
for another 60 seconds,

35:05.780 --> 35:07.612
then we breach.

35:08.016 --> 35:09.609
We clear?

35:10.985 --> 35:12.510
Kensi?

35:18.659 --> 35:19.820
Kensi!

35:19.994 --> 35:22.326
Damn it.
Eric, tell L.A.P.D. we're going in hot.

35:22.497 --> 35:23.658
Copy that.

35:24.432 --> 35:26.059
Kensi!

35:26.234 --> 35:28.362
- Hey!
- Let's go!

35:34.008 --> 35:35.066
Drop it! Federal agent!

35:40.248 --> 35:41.306
Deeks!

35:55.263 --> 35:56.526
Are you crazy?

35:56.697 --> 35:58.688
You almost took my head off.
Who takes that shot?

35:59.033 --> 36:00.831
Took you long enough.

36:01.002 --> 36:02.492
Stay with me, Thapa.

36:10.978 --> 36:14.175
I owe you guys an apology.
I'm sorry.

36:14.348 --> 36:16.715
Tell me you secured the thumb drive,
we'll forget about it.

36:17.185 --> 36:19.449
- I don't have it.
- Well, who has it? Deeks?

36:19.987 --> 36:22.752
Um, no. I mean, he would have said
if he had it, right?

36:22.924 --> 36:25.325
But I... Okay, there's no way
the Gurkha held onto it,

36:25.493 --> 36:27.427
so it's gotta be here somewhere.
I will find it.

36:31.833 --> 36:34.894
I'm thinking inside jacket pocket,
left side.

36:35.503 --> 36:36.732
I'll go right.

36:44.112 --> 36:47.742
- Ha, ha. Bingo.
- Nice call.

36:50.051 --> 36:51.746
Kensi.

36:52.587 --> 36:54.055
Apology accepted.

36:56.157 --> 36:57.420
Go be with your partner.

36:57.725 --> 36:59.215
Thanks.

37:03.397 --> 37:04.831
Lot of trouble over this thing.

37:04.999 --> 37:06.759
That's right,
so let's put it somewhere safe.

37:06.901 --> 37:10.166
You know what? That's a good idea.

37:10.471 --> 37:12.530
Watch my back, G.

37:14.809 --> 37:16.140
Here we go.

37:23.184 --> 37:27.917
He lost a lot of blood, but he'll live.
Gurkhas. Believe the hype.

37:28.089 --> 37:30.285
- Deeks...
- I'm gonna go with him to the hospital.

37:30.458 --> 37:32.290
No, hey, whoa, please, let me just...

37:32.460 --> 37:35.157
- I just wanna tell you something.
- Yeah.

37:36.931 --> 37:38.524
We're gonna figure this out.

37:39.901 --> 37:41.528
All we gotta do is talk about it.

37:42.870 --> 37:46.101
Okay, but you don't...
You don't really like the talking about it.

37:46.274 --> 37:48.675
Yeah, but I promise I'll be better
at talking about this.

37:50.444 --> 37:52.124
What do you...?
What do you mean by "this"?

37:54.315 --> 37:55.908
This.

37:57.118 --> 37:58.176
You know.

37:59.153 --> 38:00.552
This thing?

38:04.158 --> 38:06.752
Yes, our thing.

38:06.928 --> 38:10.387
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you because
there were so many people walking by.

38:10.565 --> 38:12.525
If you could just maybe say it louder
just for me.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.157
Just once, just say it.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.359
I hate you.

38:15.536 --> 38:17.402
You don't, you don't,
you don't hate me.

38:17.572 --> 38:19.040
- Our thing.
- Wow.

38:25.880 --> 38:27.678
You have to promise me
something too, though.

38:28.416 --> 38:29.713
Anything.

38:31.052 --> 38:32.884
Promise you'll be patient with me?

38:34.155 --> 38:36.249
Yo, gotta roll.

38:37.558 --> 38:39.253
See you tonight?

38:40.127 --> 38:41.492
Yeah.

38:44.599 --> 38:46.533
You do me a favor, Fern?

38:46.701 --> 38:47.725
Anything.

38:47.902 --> 38:49.233
Can you burn that shirt for me?

39:00.348 --> 39:05.081
You saw good in me
when I could not even see it in myself.

39:05.553 --> 39:08.420
I will never forget that, sahib.

39:10.524 --> 39:13.425
You know, you actually started to
tell me something back at the airstrip.

39:14.629 --> 39:18.293
You started to tell me the only way
to cross a frozen lake.

39:21.002 --> 39:22.697
Do not run.

39:23.037 --> 39:24.869
Walk slowly.

39:25.039 --> 39:28.475
Stop to look at everything.

39:28.643 --> 39:30.668
Take your time.

39:30.845 --> 39:32.643
She will wait for you.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.545
Okay.

39:48.596 --> 39:51.224
- You waiting for Deeks?
- Yeah.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.432
Pack your things, Agent Blye.

39:57.738 --> 39:59.035
Excuse me?

39:59.407 --> 40:02.433
There's a C-130 waiting for you.
You've been reassigned.

40:04.712 --> 40:05.770
Reassigned?

40:09.216 --> 40:12.277
Hetty, Assistant Director Granger says
I've been reassigned.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.581
That's correct.

40:14.755 --> 40:18.191
You'll be needing a clean shirt,
Miss Blye.

40:18.526 --> 40:21.655
- Why is he doing that?
- He's not. I am.

40:25.266 --> 40:28.668
- When will I be back?
- When the job's done.

40:29.503 --> 40:31.335
Let's move, Agent Blye.

40:47.822 --> 40:49.881
What's this about, Hetty?

40:50.157 --> 40:52.216
Need to know, gentlemen.

40:52.393 --> 40:55.454
You ever gonna stop moving us
around like pieces in a chess game?

40:55.629 --> 40:58.291
I don't move pieces, Mr. Callen.

40:58.466 --> 40:59.865
I move the board.

41:02.403 --> 41:04.098
Good night.

41:10.978 --> 41:14.004
Oh, come on, I break every traffic law
on the planet to get here

41:14.181 --> 41:16.013
and she already left?

41:17.752 --> 41:21.086
Your partner's been reassigned,
Mr. Deeks.

41:21.989 --> 41:24.185
What do you mean?
What do you mean, reassigned?

41:24.892 --> 41:26.860
A classified mission.

41:28.863 --> 41:31.924
A classified mission? For how long?

41:32.400 --> 41:33.925
Indefinitely.

41:38.472 --> 41:39.837
Indefinitely.

41:45.946 --> 41:47.710
That looks familiar.

41:48.883 --> 41:50.214
It was her dad's.

41:51.152 --> 41:53.416
Well, that is quite a gift.

41:54.155 --> 41:55.816
Yeah.

41:56.791 --> 41:59.624
Well, sometimes a knife
is just a knife.

42:02.730 --> 42:06.223
And now she's entrusted it to you.

42:15.342 --> 42:17.902
Anything else I should know, Hetty?

42:23.651 --> 42:25.312
Button up, Mr. Deeks.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.222
It's cold out there.
