01:11.981 --> 01:14.358
Pearl Harbor outer marker,
30 minutes.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.656
Hey, Case!

01:20.865 --> 01:21.908
What's happening?

01:22.075 --> 01:24.118
Where's your whites?
The Prez is coming.

01:24.327 --> 01:25.787
He won't miss me.

01:26.037 --> 01:29.791
What's this? You're in the Navy,
you've got to look good.

01:29.999 --> 01:32.293
- Cue Ball!
- Where's your whites?

01:32.543 --> 01:37.006
- Poor boy doesn't have a dress uniform.
- I've got the dress, I forgot the pumps.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.942
Tell him not to worry.
Everything here is handled.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.528
Oh, my God.

02:00.029 --> 02:02.740
No, no, that's okay.
We'll take care of it.

02:04.784 --> 02:07.453
Well, it's going to be a zoo.

02:07.954 --> 02:08.996
Chief Ryback.

02:09.372 --> 02:10.414
Send him in.

02:16.421 --> 02:18.089
Get in your dress uniform.

02:18.381 --> 02:21.384
You know how I feel about ceremonies.
I thought this time...

02:21.592 --> 02:23.845
If I had your ribbons,
I'd wear them to bed.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.221
Yes, sir.

02:25.430 --> 02:28.182
Get in your whites.
I'll introduce you to the President.

02:28.433 --> 02:31.853
- I appreciate that, but...
- That's not a good idea.

02:32.061 --> 02:35.356
For once, Commander Krill and I
are in total agreement.

02:35.815 --> 02:40.236
I have 50 gallons of bouillabaisse
I need to prepare by tomorrow.

02:40.486 --> 02:43.573
- My birthday?
- I could do the cheeseburger routine.

02:43.823 --> 02:48.703
It's not for me, it's the crew.
They really love that stuff.

02:48.911 --> 02:52.290
Just don't show your face
till after the ceremony.

02:53.124 --> 02:55.001
You're a sorry-looking sailor.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.962
That I am. Thank you, sir.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.428
Sir...

03:05.803 --> 03:08.306
...why do you tolerate that clown?

03:08.765 --> 03:10.224
I know he's a good cook...

03:10.475 --> 03:15.021
He's more than a good cook. You have
no idea. Now let him be, XO.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.814
Yes, sir.

03:23.154 --> 03:24.655
Fifty years ago today...

03:24.864 --> 03:28.117
...the infamous Japanese attack
destroyed the Pacific fleet...

03:28.368 --> 03:29.702
...here in Pearl Harbor.

03:29.952 --> 03:33.873
In honor of those who died,
the USS Missouri now returns.

03:34.999 --> 03:37.585
Built to avenge Pearl Harbor,
she did.

03:37.835 --> 03:40.296
Days after we dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima...

03:40.505 --> 03:43.257
...Japan surrendered
on the Missouri's deck...

03:43.508 --> 03:44.842
...ending World War II.

03:47.136 --> 03:49.722
The Missouri fired the first shots
of the Gulf War.

03:50.181 --> 03:53.643
Her powerful 16 inch guns destroyed
Iraqi bunkers.

03:53.893 --> 03:57.438
Her Tomahawk missiles rocketed deep
into the heart of Baghdad.

03:58.022 --> 04:01.609
The fastest and most powerful
dreadnought ever to sail the seas...

04:04.320 --> 04:05.363
Where's your tattoo?

04:05.780 --> 04:08.241
Where I got it, you don't want to see.

04:08.950 --> 04:12.203
Now the ship will be decommissioned.

04:12.412 --> 04:15.373
President Bush is paying final tribute
to the ship...

04:15.623 --> 04:17.041
...and her great history.

04:17.250 --> 04:21.212
Did you hear the joke about Andre
and Beaudreau hunting on the bayou?

04:23.589 --> 04:25.633
"Where're the guns, Druillet?"

04:26.217 --> 04:27.427
That's about right.

04:27.677 --> 04:30.680
In the end this unity
of purpose...

04:30.930 --> 04:34.559
These ceremonies not only remember war,
they celebrate peace.

04:34.809 --> 04:38.604
The President ordered the removal
of all Tomahawk cruise missiles...

04:38.855 --> 04:40.314
...from U.S. Surface ships.

04:40.565 --> 04:44.527
Tomorrow the ship embarks for
San Francisco for her final voyage.

04:44.819 --> 04:49.699
Her weaponry will be removed,
dismantled, and never fired again.

04:50.158 --> 04:54.203
The vessel will then take her place
in naval history.

04:54.454 --> 04:58.833
We will gain the inevitable triumph,
so help us God.

05:02.378 --> 05:04.922
Look at the money spent
on this photo opportunity.

05:07.633 --> 05:08.926
Ready to go, sir.

05:10.094 --> 05:12.305
Very well, let's single up.

05:13.097 --> 05:15.933
Aye, sir.
Single up all lines.

05:45.755 --> 05:49.634
- Captain, you have clear water to port.
- Very well.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.347
Krill ain't running this ship.

05:54.639 --> 05:57.558
The old man has to okay
all helicopter landings.

05:57.809 --> 06:02.313
How's the captain going to authorize
a surprise party for himself?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.690
We already stowed all the gear.

06:04.899 --> 06:06.901
What's on this helicopter?

06:07.151 --> 06:08.820
This little sweetheart.

06:10.405 --> 06:13.199
- She's in the...
- Yeah, she's in the cake.

06:13.449 --> 06:17.120
That is Miss July '89. Jordan Tate.

06:17.370 --> 06:21.332
- We'll be ready for her.
- Good. Go ahead and keep that.

06:22.792 --> 06:26.921
Lieutenant, we don't have time
to talk about this now.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.175
No time for the security
of nuclear weapons?

06:31.384 --> 06:33.469
Maybe I'm not being clear.

06:33.720 --> 06:37.265
Any watches not crucial shall be
secured during the party...

06:37.515 --> 06:39.434
...including the Marine roving patrol.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.978
We're operating
on a skeleton crew.

06:42.228 --> 06:43.396
This is an order.

06:43.646 --> 06:47.900
The log will show I consider this
unsafe, and obeyed under protest.

06:48.151 --> 06:49.235
Fine.

06:53.906 --> 06:55.366
Hey, Cue Ball.

06:56.075 --> 06:57.952
Cue Ball in the house.

06:58.202 --> 06:59.454
Show me a move!

06:59.704 --> 07:01.748
Turn up the tunes! Turn up the tunes!

07:03.458 --> 07:06.919
Come on, show me some moves.
Come on!

07:07.170 --> 07:08.755
Go, Cue Ball!

07:09.005 --> 07:11.340
Go, Cue Ball! Go, Cue Ball, go!

07:29.484 --> 07:31.277
That was cute.

07:32.528 --> 07:33.613
Petty Officer Ryback?

07:33.863 --> 07:36.366
- Ensign Taylor.
- Sir.

07:36.741 --> 07:39.869
You don't have to "sir" me.
We're casual in the galley.

07:40.119 --> 07:42.789
I'd watch it.
We still have a week together.

07:43.039 --> 07:45.666
So I won't get to see you
go through puberty.

07:48.878 --> 07:49.921
What is it?

07:50.171 --> 07:53.341
I have orders from the XO
on the captain's birthday.

07:53.591 --> 07:56.177
We're having dinner flown in
from Hawaii.

07:56.427 --> 07:58.763
This galley will be cleared by 1700.

07:59.013 --> 08:03.476
You are to report to the mess deck
prior to the helo's arrival.

08:03.726 --> 08:04.769
Negative.

08:05.019 --> 08:06.062
Excuse me?

08:06.312 --> 08:10.233
Only I cook for the captain.
You don't like that, talk to him.

08:10.483 --> 08:12.527
I don't believe you get it.

08:12.777 --> 08:16.406
See, this is a surprise party.

08:16.656 --> 08:20.410
No one is going to talk
to the captain about this.

08:20.660 --> 08:21.703
You know something?

08:23.246 --> 08:25.331
He don't like surprises.
Neither do I.

08:25.581 --> 08:29.168
Then I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?

08:38.553 --> 08:42.557
"I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?"

08:42.807 --> 08:45.059
Krill's going to skin you alive.

08:45.309 --> 08:48.646
Why is it that I'm
starting to shake so bad...

08:48.896 --> 08:50.857
...and there's this deep fear in me...

08:51.107 --> 08:55.862
...thinking about Mr. Krill and
the horrible things he'll do to me?

09:01.034 --> 09:02.160
Commander Krill.

09:03.036 --> 09:04.078
Send him in.

09:13.588 --> 09:15.298
You wanted to see me, Captain?

09:16.215 --> 09:17.300
Commander Krill...

09:17.508 --> 09:21.262
...how'd you expect to land
a helicopter without my authorization?

09:21.512 --> 09:25.641
- It was a mistake to think...
- It was a mistake to try.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.478
Your actions are
grossly insubordinate.

09:28.770 --> 09:31.355
I want an explanation. Now.

09:31.606 --> 09:36.194
Admiral Bates wants to thank you
for how smoothly things went.

09:36.444 --> 09:38.905
He has a surprise for your birthday.

09:39.155 --> 09:40.990
He's flying in from Hawaii.

09:42.241 --> 09:46.662
I see. If the admiral wants a party,
I guess we'll have one.

09:47.413 --> 09:50.958
Let's keep it simple.
Off-duty personnel can attend...

09:51.167 --> 09:52.668
...but watches remain.

09:52.919 --> 09:54.420
Yes, sir.

09:55.004 --> 09:56.130
Captain...

09:56.339 --> 09:58.883
...since he wants this to be
a surprise...

09:59.092 --> 10:01.010
...if you could stay here
till we come for you...

10:01.844 --> 10:05.765
- I'll be engrossed in a novel.
- Very good, sir.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.909
How's that bouillabaisse?
Heads up!

10:38.381 --> 10:39.716
If I'm not mistaken...

10:39.924 --> 10:43.928
...every one of you has orders
to report to the mess deck...

10:44.137 --> 10:45.888
...for the party.

10:47.598 --> 10:48.725
Stand fast.

10:51.853 --> 10:54.147
Everyone else go! Now.

10:54.647 --> 10:56.441
See you at the party.

10:59.819 --> 11:00.987
You know...

11:01.195 --> 11:02.947
...this does look delicious.

11:06.617 --> 11:08.911
It smells like a lard omelet.

11:09.787 --> 11:11.414
I put up with your shit...

11:11.664 --> 11:14.125
...because the captain likes
your cooking.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.295
But this time he won't be here
to save you.

11:17.503 --> 11:19.505
Is that right?

11:24.177 --> 11:25.470
Little flavor.

11:29.057 --> 11:30.516
You like that?

11:31.476 --> 11:33.686
That's striking an officer!

11:33.936 --> 11:35.396
It is not!

11:36.064 --> 11:37.815
That's striking an officer!

11:44.655 --> 11:48.451
- Okay! All right!
- Cuff him and throw him in the brig!

11:48.659 --> 11:52.246
- In the brig!
- You need the old man's signature.

11:52.497 --> 11:53.623
Good point.

11:53.998 --> 11:56.042
Secure him in the meat locker.

11:56.292 --> 11:58.711
Now!
Right now!

11:58.961 --> 12:00.004
Let's go.

12:00.588 --> 12:04.675
Now I know why you're a cook.
You hit like a faggot.

12:05.927 --> 12:06.969
Steel.

12:10.932 --> 12:11.974
Private Nash...

12:12.183 --> 12:14.769
...you came on board in Hawaii?
- Yes, sir.

12:14.977 --> 12:16.938
Then you don't know about Ryback?

12:19.899 --> 12:22.402
He is an extreme psychopath.

12:22.944 --> 12:25.822
He hates officers.
He hates America.

12:26.072 --> 12:29.909
This is the captain's birthday.
I don't want him ruining it.

12:30.410 --> 12:32.912
No one speaks to him
or lets him out.

12:33.162 --> 12:36.457
If he tries to escape,
shoot him right here.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.168
I'm counting on you.

12:40.002 --> 12:41.170
Yes, sir.

12:42.296 --> 12:43.548
Let's go.

12:56.018 --> 12:58.104
Another cold day in hell.

13:02.692 --> 13:06.946
It speaks well for the Navy
that we can entertain a ship at sea.

13:07.155 --> 13:08.781
It's so human.

13:09.032 --> 13:11.325
And I love that. Don't you?

13:11.576 --> 13:13.953
I just hope I don't throw up.

13:15.038 --> 13:16.164
You'll be fine.

13:32.889 --> 13:34.807
I love it. I love it!

13:55.787 --> 13:58.289
Welcome to the USS Missouri.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.760
Fantastic!

14:12.929 --> 14:16.474
We're looking forward
to a great time.

14:19.852 --> 14:21.938
I love this business!

14:22.939 --> 14:24.857
My future wife.

14:25.733 --> 14:27.276
She's landed.

14:27.985 --> 14:30.363
The Bunny's landed. See you.

14:31.406 --> 14:32.865
Private!

14:33.574 --> 14:36.911
Doesn't it seem strange
that Krill put me in here?

14:37.161 --> 14:38.454
I ain't listening to you.

14:38.996 --> 14:40.123
Welcome aboard.

14:40.331 --> 14:42.125
Guys, make a hole.

14:42.834 --> 14:46.295
Don't let them bother you.
Been at sea too long. You okay?

14:46.546 --> 14:48.798
I still feel really queasy.

14:49.507 --> 14:52.552
We'll go to the wardroom,
where you can change.

14:54.095 --> 14:56.097
Let the lady through!

15:01.978 --> 15:06.232
Be careful with the cake.
Make sure the wires are covered.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.234
That's the way it goes.

15:08.651 --> 15:11.362
- Are you lost?
- No, no. Where do you want us?

15:11.571 --> 15:13.322
- Is the band ready?
- Ready.

15:13.531 --> 15:15.324
You're over here.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.493
Starboard side, right now.

15:20.830 --> 15:23.958
You'll knock the captain
off his feet. You're beautiful.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.502
For motion sickness. Take two.

15:26.711 --> 15:28.504
Thanks.
What happened to your face?

15:28.713 --> 15:31.424
Cut myself shaving.
The cake's almost ready.

15:31.674 --> 15:36.137
We have a room for you to change.
You'll be safe from my men.

15:36.387 --> 15:38.806
I'm going to go put on
my party dress.

15:43.227 --> 15:45.938
Don't worry. You can play
this with your eyes shut.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.406
Private!

15:55.615 --> 15:57.283
Let me out!

15:57.658 --> 16:01.871
You follow Krill's orders, you'll
go to the brig! Use your head!

16:03.790 --> 16:05.583
Go get my pies out of the oven!

16:14.133 --> 16:16.135
I must be nuts.

16:22.975 --> 16:24.727
Very sick.

16:28.648 --> 16:31.651
We want to give you
a great big welcome...

16:33.152 --> 16:36.280
...to the big,
beautiful Missouri lounge...

16:38.366 --> 16:42.120
...out here in the middle
of the big beautiful Pacific Ocean.

16:43.413 --> 16:45.498
I'm Bad Billy.

16:46.666 --> 16:49.961
And these are
the fabulous Bail Jumpers!

16:51.921 --> 16:55.383
I have orders not to talk to you.
Understand? Orders.

16:55.591 --> 16:57.635
You could be held accountable...

16:57.885 --> 17:00.263
...keeping me in here like this.

17:00.888 --> 17:02.807
You have to think about that.

17:02.974 --> 17:04.016
Private?

17:04.892 --> 17:07.395
He didn't say
you can't talk to the captain.

17:07.645 --> 17:10.147
Go ask him if he wants me in here.

17:12.650 --> 17:14.694
You little E-1 prick.

17:20.074 --> 17:22.785
Lieutenant,
this is absolutely beautiful.

17:39.635 --> 17:41.721
Old man says keep her level.

17:41.971 --> 17:44.307
How about an hors d'oeuvre?

17:48.936 --> 17:50.396
What have we here?

17:52.023 --> 17:55.443
All right. There's the Twinkies.
Where's Miss July?

17:55.735 --> 17:57.028
And there she is.

17:57.236 --> 17:59.697
Miss July 1989.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.492
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

18:02.742 --> 18:04.619
That's not Miss July.

18:04.869 --> 18:06.454
My God, look at him.

18:07.497 --> 18:09.707
Commander Krill.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.800
Welcome to the revolution.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.432
This party'll make history.
No wonder he wanted everyone here.

18:31.938 --> 18:34.732
Maybe Krill isn't
such an asshole after all.

18:35.817 --> 18:40.279
That's great. Go get the old man.
He's been waiting on you now.

18:41.989 --> 18:43.116
All right.

18:43.908 --> 18:45.368
Miss July!

18:51.457 --> 18:54.252
We're going to surprise the captain now.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.297
- Have a good party!
- Come on, dear.

19:03.302 --> 19:04.470
Where's the chief?

19:04.721 --> 19:07.557
In the meat locker
until after the party.

19:07.890 --> 19:10.518
It's only like 40 degrees in there.

19:10.768 --> 19:13.813
He'll be fine. He's got a guard.

19:15.231 --> 19:18.985
Krill's a maniac.
Tell the captain he spit in my soup.

19:19.485 --> 19:21.070
You got a fire in here.

19:22.405 --> 19:23.948
Get my pies out of the oven!

20:02.570 --> 20:04.655
These pantyhose feel good!

20:07.658 --> 20:10.578
It's okay. I'm here to escort
the captain to the party.

20:11.204 --> 20:12.914
Aye, Commander.

20:14.248 --> 20:16.918
- Commander Krill.
- Send him in.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.927
I'm your date tonight, Captain.

20:38.689 --> 20:41.651
Wait. Wait a minute!

20:44.445 --> 20:46.531
Who is the highest
ranking officer here?

20:46.739 --> 20:49.409
Who is the highest ranking officer
in this room?

20:50.535 --> 20:52.078
Stand up.

20:52.704 --> 20:54.455
Stand up and be recognized.

20:56.541 --> 20:59.377
Part the waves there.
Get out of the man's way.

20:59.627 --> 21:01.379
Put a light on the man.

21:01.629 --> 21:06.259
Now you, sir, are the highest
ranking officer in this room?

21:06.801 --> 21:09.387
Yes. Operations officer.
Third in command.

21:09.637 --> 21:12.765
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Commander Green.

21:17.061 --> 21:18.312
Get down!

21:22.358 --> 21:23.443
What's going on?

21:23.693 --> 21:25.236
The party's just beginning.

21:27.405 --> 21:28.448
Captain!

21:29.949 --> 21:30.992
Good shot.

21:31.242 --> 21:32.952
Lay down! Hands up!

21:33.202 --> 21:34.245
Heads down!

21:34.495 --> 21:37.415
What are you looking at?
On the floor!

21:37.623 --> 21:38.875
Put your head down.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.044
You want to be good now?

21:41.586 --> 21:43.129
What is this, a joke?

21:43.337 --> 21:44.714
No joke!

21:46.966 --> 21:48.676
I hear gunfire. What's going on?

21:54.932 --> 21:55.975
It's done.

22:01.564 --> 22:03.816
Four minutes ahead of schedule.

22:10.531 --> 22:13.826
Mother Goose,
the quails are in the nest.

22:18.539 --> 22:19.665
It's just the music.

22:19.916 --> 22:23.836
You got shit for brains.
That's gunfire. Call the bridge.

22:24.253 --> 22:27.465
I don't know who you're talking to.
No one's listening.

22:27.924 --> 22:30.218
I ain't asking you to listen to me.

22:30.426 --> 22:32.887
Call the captain. Listen to him.

22:41.979 --> 22:43.272
Seal it!

23:03.084 --> 23:05.211
Eyes on the man in front of you!

23:05.420 --> 23:08.631
Goddamn it,
that's the last time I'll tell you!

23:19.225 --> 23:21.310
Let this be a learning experience.

23:21.519 --> 23:24.522
If you resist, we will kill you
and the man next to you.

23:24.731 --> 23:27.942
Now move out of here
in an orderly fashion.

23:30.653 --> 23:31.696
Now!

24:06.314 --> 24:07.982
Turn around. Hands on your head.

24:31.172 --> 24:33.257
Where is it?

24:34.759 --> 24:36.844
Here it is.

24:37.178 --> 24:39.889
Listen to the shit
I've had to put up with.

24:42.350 --> 24:46.604
"Commander Krill has become
increasingly hostile to the crew...

24:46.854 --> 24:50.149
...possibly due to anger over
reviews of his performance.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.488
I recommend psychological
evaluation before his next assignment."

24:59.951 --> 25:02.745
Do I look like I need a
psychological evaluation?

25:03.830 --> 25:05.373
Not at all.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.502
I got to change.

25:18.886 --> 25:20.388
Behind your head.

25:23.641 --> 25:25.143
Up against the wall.

25:29.230 --> 25:30.940
XO on the bridge.

25:31.941 --> 25:33.359
Listen up.

25:33.609 --> 25:36.529
Hands on your head and move
to the counter, right now.

25:38.489 --> 25:43.619
Your destination is the fo'c's'le.
Cooperate and you won't be harmed.

25:48.374 --> 25:50.001
Change of watch.

25:53.046 --> 25:55.882
You've done a good job,
but you're relieved of duty.

25:58.634 --> 26:00.845
Get your hand off that console.

26:09.103 --> 26:11.647
You're a cheeky bastard. Move out!

26:15.610 --> 26:18.029
My God! Bunch of wussies.

26:25.244 --> 26:27.455
The disk, Mr. Pitt.

26:29.290 --> 26:30.875
Guard it with your life.

26:31.334 --> 26:32.668
Of course.

26:33.378 --> 26:35.880
Bring up the layout, if you will.

26:39.092 --> 26:42.470
- We've overridden their systems.
- We control crypto, CIC...

26:42.720 --> 26:46.432
...engine rooms, boiler rooms,
bridge and all open decks.

26:46.682 --> 26:49.227
We've welded shut the hatches.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.313
A few loose sailors may be berthing...

26:52.563 --> 26:55.566
...or they're caught in nonessential
areas and can go nowhere.

26:55.817 --> 26:59.320
- The rest are in the fo'c's'le.
- Excellent.

26:59.529 --> 27:02.615
Reactivate the weapons systems,
Mr. Pitt.

27:02.824 --> 27:03.866
Mr. Daumer...

27:04.325 --> 27:08.996
...you may deploy the welding crews
and chop up broadway.

27:10.123 --> 27:13.960
Commander Krill,
you're hereby promoted to captain.

27:14.168 --> 27:17.714
Congratulations. The ship is yours.

27:18.172 --> 27:19.632
The ship is mine.

27:20.925 --> 27:23.386
Thank you, Billy.
All right!

27:23.636 --> 27:26.681
Can we get something to eat in here?!

27:28.141 --> 27:29.559
Get some food!

27:34.897 --> 27:36.566
Krill warned me you were tricky.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.779
I'm not tricky, I'm just freezing.
Something's going on here.

27:42.030 --> 27:44.240
Call the bridge.
No one'll yell at you.

27:44.449 --> 27:46.868
It's just your job.
Check right away.

27:47.118 --> 27:49.662
All right.
All right, I'll check.

27:50.079 --> 27:51.330
That's all.

27:51.581 --> 27:53.249
Do that. And be careful.

27:57.462 --> 27:59.088
'Tis a rare thing.

28:00.757 --> 28:02.800
This is good. It'll work.

28:03.009 --> 28:06.804
Got a call from Private Nash
on guard duty in the kitchen.

28:07.055 --> 28:09.140
Pitt, pull it up.

28:09.974 --> 28:13.019
That's an unsecured area.
They can access the whole ship.

28:17.231 --> 28:20.318
Ryback. A cook.
A pain-in-the-ass cook.

28:20.526 --> 28:21.903
Give me that.

28:23.071 --> 28:24.113
Private Nash.

28:25.281 --> 28:28.076
I'm glad you checked in.
I've been with the captain.

28:28.701 --> 28:31.454
Keep Ryback under control
and don't open the door.

28:31.704 --> 28:33.289
Tell him you're sending relief.

28:34.707 --> 28:38.878
Tell him you are sending
somebody to relieve him.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.592
Stand your station fast.
I'm sending someone to relieve you.

28:44.842 --> 28:48.888
Is everything okay?
We heard what sounded like gunshots.

28:50.139 --> 28:52.225
Gunshots? Oh, that.

28:52.517 --> 28:54.727
Those are party poppers. Firecrackers.

28:55.186 --> 28:56.437
Part of the party.

28:56.687 --> 28:59.148
Stand firm until you're relieved.

28:59.399 --> 29:01.901
- Yes, sir.
- Over and out.

29:06.155 --> 29:07.865
Anything else you didn't tell us?

29:08.116 --> 29:11.411
Any further memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps?

29:11.661 --> 29:14.831
No other memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps.

29:15.081 --> 29:18.793
There's two men. One's locked up.
I'll take care of it.

29:20.211 --> 29:24.507
We'll handle it. Secure the galley.
Send Cates and Ziggs.

29:24.716 --> 29:26.175
This Marine's armed.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.803
We need more. I'll go.

29:29.053 --> 29:31.431
Don't worry. They're professionals.

29:31.681 --> 29:34.183
They can handle twenty Marines...

29:34.434 --> 29:36.561
...and 100 cooks.

29:42.316 --> 29:44.902
You're wrong, Ryback. You're wrong.

29:45.236 --> 29:48.489
- They were party poppers.
- You got shit for brains.

29:48.740 --> 29:53.327
I know they brainwashed you,
but you have to question authority.

29:53.578 --> 29:55.288
Trust me, boy.

29:55.538 --> 29:58.583
That's gunfire.
Free me and I'll take care of it.

29:59.208 --> 30:03.546
I'll be relieved in a few minutes,
so just shut up and sit tight.

30:03.796 --> 30:07.091
Something's going on.
Use your head this time.

30:07.341 --> 30:09.177
Do what you got to do. Let me out.

30:09.635 --> 30:12.096
Or when I'm out,
I'll shoot you myself.

30:17.435 --> 30:18.853
Commander Krill?

30:21.522 --> 30:22.857
Is that you?

30:26.694 --> 30:30.198
Get your hands on your head.
Turn around.

30:30.782 --> 30:32.283
Get down on your knees.

30:32.575 --> 30:33.993
Cross your ankles.

30:39.999 --> 30:41.459
Where's the cook?

30:41.709 --> 30:43.169
In the reefer.

30:43.795 --> 30:45.088
Which one?

31:16.035 --> 31:17.870
Son of a bitch!

33:38.553 --> 33:40.263
We've got an F-18.

33:43.808 --> 33:46.519
They sent an F-18
to look for the chopper.

33:47.895 --> 33:52.066
Heading 315 miles, speed 430,
approximately 8000.

33:55.695 --> 33:58.197
207, 61 miles now.

34:20.719 --> 34:23.431
430. 5000 now, into descent.

34:24.599 --> 34:26.434
We're going down now.

35:04.305 --> 35:06.766
Looks like one helo on deck.

35:11.729 --> 35:13.189
Going in for a closer look.

35:18.653 --> 35:20.947
31 to Missouri, over.

35:22.323 --> 35:23.658
Goodbye!

35:25.827 --> 35:27.829
Are you tracking me?

35:28.037 --> 35:29.080
Negative.

35:30.581 --> 35:32.959
He's locked me up! Mayday.

35:44.846 --> 35:46.889
Welcome to the revolution.

35:52.603 --> 35:54.230
Better call the office.

36:17.712 --> 36:19.547
You're in deep kimchi, buddy.

36:19.756 --> 36:22.383
Better have it all
in one sock for this one.

36:23.134 --> 36:25.928
Claims he was a company man
who worked for you.

36:26.179 --> 36:27.472
What's his name?

36:27.722 --> 36:29.348
William Strannix.

36:30.058 --> 36:32.143
Jesus Christ!

36:33.644 --> 36:34.687
Not good.

36:35.730 --> 36:37.065
Not good.

36:46.949 --> 36:48.159
Mr. Breaker...

36:49.243 --> 36:51.871
...you better be candid
with us here tonight.

36:52.080 --> 36:54.582
We need answers,
and we need them now.

36:56.834 --> 37:01.631
Gentlemen, if any ships or aircraft
approach within 100 miles...

37:01.881 --> 37:06.010
...we will kill the crew and
retaliate using the ship 's arsenal.

37:07.261 --> 37:10.056
Bill, this is Tom. What's going on?

37:11.474 --> 37:13.893
I have 32 Tomahawks under my thumb...

37:14.143 --> 37:16.729
...and all you can do
is alert the media.

37:17.397 --> 37:18.940
You don't have the launch codes.

37:19.190 --> 37:20.358
Let me guess.

37:23.986 --> 37:27.115
"5-6-6-0-4-9-9-7-8-0?"

37:29.867 --> 37:31.452
This is insane.

37:31.703 --> 37:33.913
Be careful with that word, Tom.

37:34.706 --> 37:39.168
This is Admiral Bates speaking.
Tell us why you're doing this.

37:39.335 --> 37:40.378
Hi, Admiral!

37:40.628 --> 37:44.799
Six months ago, Tom Breaker
canceled Operation Cleopatra.

37:45.007 --> 37:50.138
Shortly thereafter, two young men
from Langley tried to cancel me.

37:51.013 --> 37:54.475
Didn 't you receive each man 's
forefinger in the mail?

37:58.312 --> 37:59.355
Yes.

37:59.605 --> 38:02.650
Did you expect us
to wait for you to try again?

38:03.651 --> 38:05.570
I know things are a little...

38:06.904 --> 38:09.574
...chaotic for you right now.
- Chaotic!

38:09.824 --> 38:11.492
Wake up!

38:12.702 --> 38:17.165
You and I know that chaos and
bedlam are consuming the entire world.

38:17.415 --> 38:20.793
UV rays are only the beginning.
We have an inch of topsoil left.

38:21.711 --> 38:22.754
Topsoil?

38:23.004 --> 38:27.800
Sexually transmitted diseases,
depletion of the gene pool.

38:28.092 --> 38:29.469
It adds up to oblivion.

38:29.719 --> 38:32.513
Governments will fall.
Anarchy will reign.

38:32.764 --> 38:34.682
It's a brave new world.

38:35.933 --> 38:37.769
What are you planning to do?

38:38.019 --> 38:42.857
Do you realize that whatever I do
is inevitable? Can we agree on that?

38:43.691 --> 38:45.109
Not necessarily.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.611
There you go.

38:46.861 --> 38:51.407
You can't argue with me
or negotiate or attempt a ploy.

38:51.657 --> 38:54.327
You have to reconsider your philosophy.

38:54.577 --> 38:58.623
All right, I'm sorry.
Whatever you decide to do is inevitable.

38:58.831 --> 38:59.874
Look at my life.

39:00.124 --> 39:04.379
The life you tried to take.
There was Annapolis, Vietnam, so on.

39:04.629 --> 39:07.882
I missed the 60s,
and I believe if I had been there...

39:08.132 --> 39:11.260
...to contribute,
everything would've been fine.

39:11.511 --> 39:15.556
Bill, if this is about reliving
the 60s, you can forget it.

39:15.807 --> 39:17.350
The movement is dead.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.060
Hence the name.

39:19.310 --> 39:21.896
It moves a certain distance,
then it stops.

39:22.146 --> 39:26.401
Revolution gets its name by always
coming back around in your face.

39:26.859 --> 39:29.737
You tried to kill me,
you son of a bitch.

39:30.029 --> 39:32.365
So welcome to the revolution.

39:32.824 --> 39:35.368
There's more to follow.
I'll stay in touch.

39:39.539 --> 39:40.873
He's flipped.

39:42.417 --> 39:43.710
He's completely flipped.

39:44.877 --> 39:47.880
I want a list of everything
on that ship.

39:51.759 --> 39:54.220
General, here's what we know.

39:54.887 --> 39:59.350
The threat is verifiable. It is real.
I repeat, it is real.

40:01.227 --> 40:03.354
Shit! You son of a bitch.

40:03.563 --> 40:04.856
Think they believe you?

40:05.106 --> 40:08.359
They believe I'm crazy, paranoid
or something.

40:08.609 --> 40:10.319
I have a harpoon locked on.

40:10.570 --> 40:11.612
Fire when ready.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.874
Pipe down, men!
Pipe down.

40:24.500 --> 40:25.877
Missile away.

40:32.133 --> 40:33.426
Missile away.

40:34.010 --> 40:35.094
Oh, boy.

40:36.596 --> 40:38.389
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

40:47.899 --> 40:49.525
Bang! You're dead.

40:52.612 --> 40:56.074
- He's taken out satellite relay.
- What doesn't he want us to see?

40:56.282 --> 40:57.617
He wants to blind us.

40:57.825 --> 41:01.245
It's illogical. We can
follow his movement from Pearl.

41:01.496 --> 41:02.914
You can vector an AWACS.

41:03.373 --> 41:06.584
- Or send E-2C from Nimitz.
- Do it.

41:07.794 --> 41:09.545
Wake up the President.

41:13.424 --> 41:14.592
Bring it in.

41:16.177 --> 41:17.970
Keep it coming in.

41:19.305 --> 41:22.600
Cut it fast.
Time is money on this deal.

41:24.769 --> 41:28.648
- They better be competent.
- Get your ass up there!

41:29.899 --> 41:31.150
Watch your heads.

41:37.615 --> 41:39.701
Glad I sent you the blueprints.

41:42.036 --> 41:44.956
I have 4 sections this way,
7 sections this way.

41:45.206 --> 41:48.000
I'll have it cut and up in an hour.

41:53.214 --> 41:55.842
Time is money, on this job!

41:59.095 --> 42:01.097
Time is money.

42:02.056 --> 42:05.852
This will cut them to the bone.
Right to the bone.

42:09.522 --> 42:11.024
What's that noise?

42:11.315 --> 42:13.067
That's my beloved crew.

42:17.530 --> 42:21.617
Keep trying. Keep pounding.
Someone will hear us.

43:34.732 --> 43:35.983
Shut the music off.

43:46.619 --> 43:48.705
What the hell's going on?

43:50.581 --> 43:52.291
What happened to them?

43:57.130 --> 44:01.509
- Who are you and why are you here?
- My name is Jordan Tate.

44:01.801 --> 44:03.428
I'm Miss July '89.

44:04.721 --> 44:07.390
I was hired to jump
out of the cake...

44:07.640 --> 44:10.977
...but I got airsick
on the way here and so...

44:11.185 --> 44:13.688
...this guy gave me these pills.

44:13.938 --> 44:17.191
- I guess I fell asleep.
- What kind of bullshit is this!

44:17.734 --> 44:20.069
I am an actress, okay?

44:20.319 --> 44:23.031
I did a Hunter episode
and a Wet 'n Wild video.

44:23.281 --> 44:26.659
My agent said I was
going to jump out of the cake.

44:26.868 --> 44:28.244
How many on the chopper?

44:29.162 --> 44:30.288
I don't know.

44:30.538 --> 44:33.833
It was full.
There was a band and caterers.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.043
Where's the crew?

44:36.002 --> 44:38.671
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

44:39.380 --> 44:42.425
You didn't see or hear anything
and don't remember anything?

44:43.092 --> 44:45.470
I've done stupid things in my life...

44:45.720 --> 44:48.389
...but believe me,
I don't know anything.

44:50.725 --> 44:52.352
All right, I believe you.

44:55.355 --> 44:59.776
So who are you? Are you
a special forces guy or something?

45:00.360 --> 45:01.694
I'm just a cook.

45:02.945 --> 45:04.030
A cook?

45:04.280 --> 45:06.616
Just a lowly, lowly cook.

45:07.408 --> 45:09.619
My God, we're going to die.

45:10.328 --> 45:13.664
The ship contains 40,000 rounds
of 20mm CWIZ.

45:14.082 --> 45:16.125
Over 100016-inch projectiles.

45:16.376 --> 45:21.130
We believe there's 15 harpoon
cruise missiles still aboard...

45:21.339 --> 45:22.757
...and 32 Tomahawks.

45:23.007 --> 45:25.051
What kind of Tomahawks?

45:25.510 --> 45:27.053
It's all right. It's okay.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.180
Eight of them are specials.

45:29.389 --> 45:32.642
Nuclear-tipped. 220 kilotons each.

45:33.059 --> 45:36.938
Mr. Breaker, would you explain how
this nut could hold a top position...

45:37.146 --> 45:38.898
...in an intelligence agency?

45:39.148 --> 45:40.942
Would you answer that?

45:41.401 --> 45:46.114
High-level covert operatives
like Strannix are under great stress.

45:46.864 --> 45:49.951
They're creative thinkers
who, by their very nature...

45:50.201 --> 45:53.162
Tom trains everyone
in the CIA who's crazy.

45:53.621 --> 45:58.418
All we want to know
is how he got our battleship.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.254
That's his specialty.

46:03.715 --> 46:07.635
North Korea was refitting a sub
to fire antiship missiles...

46:07.885 --> 46:09.220
...so we sent Strannix in.

46:09.470 --> 46:12.974
You've been financing
this maniac's private army?

46:13.224 --> 46:15.601
You didn't think
it might be a problem?

46:16.310 --> 46:19.272
Once we realized we'd
lost positive control...

46:20.398 --> 46:24.527
...we tried to neutralize him.
We missed.

46:25.194 --> 46:26.404
Excuse me.

46:26.612 --> 46:28.990
This North Korean sub...

46:29.907 --> 46:31.701
How do you know he sunk it?

46:33.786 --> 46:36.080
Oh, we're positive he sunk it.

46:36.330 --> 46:37.498
Positive.

46:45.715 --> 46:49.052
Roadrunner to Tweety Bird.
Do you read me? Come in.

46:49.802 --> 46:52.180
Tweety Bird to Roadrunner.
We're nearby.

46:52.638 --> 46:55.016
- How's it going?
- Sub's up.

46:55.266 --> 46:58.603
- It's all rock and roll to me.
- Any sign of Wile E. Coyote?

46:58.853 --> 47:01.522
No. Meet at the birdcage.
Roadrunner out.

47:02.106 --> 47:03.441
You're the Roadrunner?

47:03.816 --> 47:05.276
Never been caught.

47:07.653 --> 47:10.323
Problem. Cates and Ziggs are missing.

47:10.990 --> 47:13.618
I radioed them repeatedly.
No response.

47:13.868 --> 47:16.037
- The last location?
- The galley.

47:16.287 --> 47:19.415
I told you to send more men.
I told you.

47:19.665 --> 47:22.001
Please don't leave me here alone.

47:22.251 --> 47:26.714
Believe me, this is the safest place
you can be. Understand?

47:28.674 --> 47:30.218
Let me out of here!

47:35.723 --> 47:37.266
Let me out!

47:37.934 --> 47:40.895
Do you understand what'll happen
if anybody hears you?

47:41.145 --> 47:42.772
They'll try to kill us.

47:44.232 --> 47:45.692
Now be quiet.

47:51.864 --> 47:53.491
I hate being alone.

47:53.783 --> 47:55.076
Do you hate being dead?

48:03.376 --> 48:04.585
Clear!

48:15.805 --> 48:17.265
Put those on.

48:27.734 --> 48:30.695
You're coming with me,
you got to be invisible.

48:30.945 --> 48:34.157
If you're by a hatch and see the enemy,
you become the hatch.

48:34.407 --> 48:38.578
I'm giving you this rifle
with a selector switch on it.

48:39.037 --> 48:42.165
One is fully automatic,
one is semiautomatic.

48:42.415 --> 48:45.960
The definition of semiautomatic is,
when you depress the trigger...

48:46.210 --> 48:47.879
...one round will go off.

48:48.129 --> 48:52.717
That's what I want to give you.
Spend one round at a time.

48:54.427 --> 48:55.511
Turn on the lights.

48:55.762 --> 48:58.598
Check the breaker box.
It's happened before.

49:02.518 --> 49:04.228
Man who did this is a professional.

49:07.190 --> 49:10.610
- Who is he and why is he on my ship?
- Your ship?

49:10.860 --> 49:14.030
You wouldn't be on this battleship
if not for me.

49:14.280 --> 49:16.449
He's a cook, plain and simple.

49:16.657 --> 49:19.702
- A cook didn't do this.
- He came with the captain.

49:19.911 --> 49:23.915
I know his routine front and back.
He's good with cooking knives.

49:24.832 --> 49:26.000
Cooking knives!

49:29.003 --> 49:30.046
He got lucky.

49:31.172 --> 49:34.008
In my professional opinion,
he is a military reject...

49:34.258 --> 49:36.427
...in command of a galley.

49:38.012 --> 49:39.055
Get down!

49:53.653 --> 49:55.321
- What was that?
- A bomb, jackass.

49:55.571 --> 49:58.032
He used the microwave as a detonator.

49:58.282 --> 50:00.910
Secure everything
between here and the CIC.

50:01.119 --> 50:04.288
You see anything, radio at once
for backup. Understand?

50:04.497 --> 50:06.416
Put these fires out!

50:09.419 --> 50:13.297
I'd like to see the personnel file
on this "simple cook."

50:14.632 --> 50:16.467
Put out these goddamn fires!

50:19.595 --> 50:23.266
SEAL Team 5 will launch from Nimitz
aboard a CH-53 Echo...

50:23.558 --> 50:25.685
...with an Apache gunship in support.

50:25.935 --> 50:29.605
At the objective area, the Apache
will take out the ship's radar...

50:29.856 --> 50:32.108
...and her electronic warfare systems.

50:32.442 --> 50:35.069
Then SEAL Team 5 will board
and retake the ship.

50:35.319 --> 50:37.739
And the odds of success?

50:37.947 --> 50:40.825
If it's a lunatic who only
partly controls the ship...

50:41.075 --> 50:42.410
...the odds are good.

50:43.786 --> 50:45.997
But if he's ready for us...

50:46.247 --> 50:48.583
...if he's prepared to repel boarders...

50:49.292 --> 50:50.793
...the odds are not good.

50:51.127 --> 50:55.757
Bear in mind, the operators
from SEAL Team 5 are the best there are.

50:55.965 --> 51:00.094
This is our only hope of saving
the crew and retaking the ship.

51:00.344 --> 51:03.765
Let me make one thing
absolutely clear:

51:04.599 --> 51:06.768
If the SEAL team fails...

51:07.018 --> 51:11.064
...we will have no alternative
but to launch an air strike...

51:11.981 --> 51:14.192
...and destroy the Missouri.

51:16.152 --> 51:17.945
You know what that means.

51:18.988 --> 51:20.698
We'll get her back for you.

51:21.115 --> 51:23.534
Make it happen. Make it happen.

51:24.327 --> 51:27.038
22... 12... perfect.

51:27.622 --> 51:30.958
It's 44 feet from the weather deck
to the missile canisters.

51:31.209 --> 51:34.837
It'll take a half hour to assemble
that section of the crane.

51:35.755 --> 51:40.927
Ryback's file was in the captain's
private cabinet.

51:41.177 --> 51:43.137
Ryback is an ex-SEAL.

51:43.388 --> 51:45.098
The goddamn cook's a SEAL?

51:45.348 --> 51:48.351
Shut up and listen.
"Expert in martial arts...

51:48.601 --> 51:50.812
...explosives, weapons, tactics.

51:51.062 --> 51:54.399
Silver Star. Navy Cross.
Purple Heart with cluster.

51:55.274 --> 51:59.821
Security revoked after Panama."
So he could only rate as a yeoman...

52:00.363 --> 52:03.324
...or a cook. How little did I know.

52:03.574 --> 52:06.035
We lost two men in the engine room.

52:06.244 --> 52:09.163
You were told to review
every crew member's file.

52:09.414 --> 52:12.709
I know, but I didn't have access
to the captain's files!

52:12.959 --> 52:16.045
- I'll get this fucker myself.
- Oh, no, calm down.

52:16.295 --> 52:18.381
- Want to get killed?
- Are you an idiot?

52:18.631 --> 52:20.675
- You're calling me an idiot?
- Yes, I am.

52:20.925 --> 52:24.595
Calm down. Get me three roving patrols.
Keep him below the weather deck.

52:24.846 --> 52:26.431
- Move out!
- Stay on schedule!

52:28.558 --> 52:29.934
To the bridge!

52:32.353 --> 52:35.314
I'm the girl.
Why do I have to carry everything?

52:35.565 --> 52:39.277
- I support women's lib, don't you?
- When it's in my favor.

52:39.736 --> 52:42.155
- Hear this, all personnel.
- Move ahead.

52:42.405 --> 52:44.449
Beware of booby traps.

52:44.699 --> 52:48.161
Do not pursue hostile parties
into unsecured areas.

52:48.786 --> 52:53.374
Report to Daumer individually
at 5-minute intervals and switch...

52:53.624 --> 52:55.668
...to the alternate frequency.

52:55.918 --> 52:57.045
Now.

53:00.757 --> 53:02.592
Goddamn SEAL.

53:03.676 --> 53:05.470
I'll carry everything...

53:06.012 --> 53:08.556
...if you kill whoever we run into.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.559
I have a rule about killing people.

53:13.269 --> 53:15.563
Actually, I have two rules. One:

53:15.813 --> 53:18.775
I don't date musicians.
And two: I don't kill people.

53:19.275 --> 53:21.652
I'm thrilled to death to hear that.

53:21.903 --> 53:24.822
But it leaves a lot of open territory.
Get up the ladder.

53:25.031 --> 53:26.366
- Let's go.
- God!

53:28.409 --> 53:31.162
I think you've got the wrong partner.

53:34.832 --> 53:36.376
Now wait here.

53:41.005 --> 53:42.423
Sit down there.

53:43.716 --> 53:45.635
I'll be back in a minute.

55:13.389 --> 55:14.766
What's that?

55:17.477 --> 55:18.728
What is that?

55:19.479 --> 55:21.356
This is a SEAL magnaphone.

55:21.606 --> 55:25.651
It's an MX 20-20.
It's a secure satellite uplink.

55:26.652 --> 55:28.071
Like a car phone.

55:29.655 --> 55:31.699
Yeah. Something like that.

55:39.123 --> 55:40.792
Excuse me, this is hot.

55:45.129 --> 55:46.631
You know Casey Ryback?

55:47.256 --> 55:48.549
Chief Ryback?

55:48.800 --> 55:51.719
He's top hand in the Teams.
Wish we had him here.

55:51.969 --> 55:55.056
He's calling on a SEAL magnaphone
from the ship.

55:55.556 --> 55:56.599
What?

55:57.809 --> 56:00.103
Listen. Everyone listen up.

56:01.354 --> 56:02.438
Affirmative.

56:03.272 --> 56:05.858
Can you estimate
the size of the force?

56:06.067 --> 56:08.027
I'd say about 30.

56:08.403 --> 56:10.321
We'll connect you to Captain Garza.

56:10.530 --> 56:11.989
Stand by.

56:12.240 --> 56:13.783
What if he's working for them?

56:14.867 --> 56:18.413
- I guarantee Ryback's a good guy.
- Wait a minute.

56:19.122 --> 56:22.166
We won't take the chance.
Don't tell him our plan.

56:23.751 --> 56:26.504
- Chief Ryback, Captain Garza.
- Glad you're there.

56:26.754 --> 56:30.299
What we want you to do
is just feed us on-site intell.

56:30.550 --> 56:33.428
This man may be crazy,
but he's a professional.

56:33.678 --> 56:37.724
They're manufacturing a railing
system to offload the Tomahawks.

56:38.182 --> 56:40.518
Believe it or not,
the X O's with them.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.564
Commander Krill's involved?

56:44.814 --> 56:45.898
Admiral...

56:46.733 --> 56:48.818
...that means
they control the ship.

56:49.318 --> 56:50.486
Holy God.

56:51.612 --> 56:55.324
Chief Ryback,
this is Admiral Bates speaking.

56:55.992 --> 57:00.455
Coordinate your efforts with us.
I want you to keep cool...

57:00.913 --> 57:03.624
...and wait for the strike team.
Do you understand?

57:03.875 --> 57:06.252
I'll go before they pick up the signal.

57:06.502 --> 57:09.005
- Call us in half an hour.
- Roger that.

57:09.338 --> 57:10.840
You're not a cook.

57:12.759 --> 57:14.093
Yeah, well...

57:16.763 --> 57:18.306
...I also cook.

57:18.556 --> 57:20.016
Get your stuff.

57:20.558 --> 57:23.561
He had an extremely distinguished
career until Panama...

57:23.811 --> 57:26.773
...when most of his team died
due to poor intelligence.

57:27.774 --> 57:30.193
Ryback's a warrior. The best there is.

57:30.443 --> 57:33.863
When he got back from Panama,
he punched his officer in charge.

57:34.113 --> 57:37.617
Adams took him on as a cook
so he could finish his 20.

57:37.867 --> 57:39.702
Hold it. Just hold it.

57:39.994 --> 57:43.831
What if this toad, Zwieback,
or whatever his name is, is right...

57:44.082 --> 57:48.086
...and the missiles are offloaded
before the SEAL team gets there?

57:48.336 --> 57:51.255
There is no way for Mr. Strannix
to get past us.

57:52.799 --> 57:55.343
We have AWAC surveillance
and SOSUS in Honolulu...

57:55.551 --> 57:58.429
...tracking every ship and sub at sea.

57:59.722 --> 58:01.516
They leave the Missouri,
they're ours.

58:01.724 --> 58:05.687
How do we know that Honolulu
isn't his next target?

58:06.396 --> 58:07.897
Tell me that.

58:21.411 --> 58:23.079
Take a look at this.

58:24.747 --> 58:28.459
- Know what all those lights are for?
- I've been trained.

58:33.005 --> 58:34.924
You can fly that helicopter?

58:35.591 --> 58:38.052
Then we can get out of here, right?

58:38.553 --> 58:40.430
Here's the MP5K.

58:41.139 --> 58:43.808
When the dot's on target,
what you see is what you get.

58:44.017 --> 58:47.687
- I told you I don't like guns.
- I know. Neither do I.

58:48.771 --> 58:50.565
Now get back under there.

59:19.886 --> 59:23.431
These things are going to sell
like hot cakes!

59:23.681 --> 59:25.266
Absolutely.

59:26.392 --> 59:28.936
What'll you do
with the $200 million?

59:29.187 --> 59:30.438
Buy the Presidency.

59:59.133 --> 01:00:00.843
Someone's moving. Right there!

01:00:04.931 --> 01:00:07.809
He's on the flight deck! Go! Go!

01:00:52.145 --> 01:00:53.730
Come out of there!

01:01:08.036 --> 01:01:13.082
Where are you taking me?
I don't know anything!

01:01:15.835 --> 01:01:17.045
Let go of me!

01:01:18.212 --> 01:01:19.922
Get your hands off me!

01:01:20.339 --> 01:01:21.507
Now!

01:01:31.642 --> 01:01:32.935
Move!

01:01:43.863 --> 01:01:45.198
Move!

01:01:47.617 --> 01:01:49.535
Stand fast!
Do not pursue that man!

01:01:56.751 --> 01:02:00.380
- Secure missile battery three, now!
- Man that hatch!

01:02:00.797 --> 01:02:02.173
This guy's a pain in the ass!

01:02:02.382 --> 01:02:04.342
We got to do something about him.

01:02:04.592 --> 01:02:06.135
I know what to do.

01:02:08.137 --> 01:02:09.222
I do.

01:02:12.392 --> 01:02:14.727
This insanity is so logical.

01:02:15.395 --> 01:02:19.357
There's a sprinkler system
where they're being held.

01:02:19.899 --> 01:02:21.192
Mr. Pitt?

01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:24.278
The fo'c's'le.

01:02:25.571 --> 01:02:27.907
Hit a button, it starts to flood.

01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:30.952
In a short time, they'll all drown.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.371
Ryback'll kill himself to save them.

01:02:43.464 --> 01:02:45.008
You're a maniac.

01:02:45.258 --> 01:02:47.010
Drowning your own crew.

01:02:47.969 --> 01:02:49.887
They never liked me anyway.

01:02:50.888 --> 01:02:53.182
Bet they fucking love you now.

01:03:00.064 --> 01:03:02.650
You see this?
These are cut everywhere.

01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:04.193
What is it?

01:03:04.444 --> 01:03:08.614
They're for a railing system to offload
the missiles onto a ship or sub...

01:03:08.865 --> 01:03:10.742
...they'll rendezvous with.

01:03:13.119 --> 01:03:14.287
What's that?

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.415
Morse code.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.585
What're they saying?

01:03:22.837 --> 01:03:25.256
"Get me the fuck out of here."

01:03:32.597 --> 01:03:34.932
- What's that?
- Get away from the hatch!

01:04:05.296 --> 01:04:08.091
Guard the door.
Shoot anyone who comes through.

01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:09.842
You okay?

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.053
You okay?

01:04:14.389 --> 01:04:16.015
Is this all of you?

01:04:16.265 --> 01:04:18.476
Six of us got trapped.
What's happening?

01:04:18.726 --> 01:04:21.145
We got a problem. Who's this?

01:04:21.979 --> 01:04:24.691
Calaway, Gunner's mate,
2nd class, '44, '46.

01:04:24.941 --> 01:04:29.362
This is Jordan. She's a casualty
of the situation I'll brief you on.

01:04:29.737 --> 01:04:32.031
Nice to see you. You too, Case.

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.659
Granger, you take this.

01:04:35.159 --> 01:04:37.870
Get your tools. We've got work to do.

01:04:39.163 --> 01:04:41.582
We're jumping into a shit storm here.

01:04:50.591 --> 01:04:52.677
Must've been a power surge.

01:04:59.434 --> 01:05:00.768
That's the last one.

01:05:01.019 --> 01:05:04.272
This should disable their
weapons systems within a half hour.

01:05:04.856 --> 01:05:07.984
Mr. Ryback,
may I have your attention, please?

01:05:08.484 --> 01:05:10.737
This is Captain Krill speaking.

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.910
I'd like you to look
at the monitors...

01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:20.413
...where you are
at this point in time.

01:05:22.331 --> 01:05:23.791
Are you watching?

01:05:24.459 --> 01:05:26.294
I prepared a special show for you.

01:05:29.505 --> 01:05:30.548
Here it goes.

01:05:34.969 --> 01:05:37.722
I want you to know
there are no hard feelings.

01:05:39.557 --> 01:05:41.851
I have no grudge against you...

01:05:42.226 --> 01:05:44.187
...or the rest of the crew.

01:05:44.395 --> 01:05:45.730
You did your best.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:55.365
Discipline is right out
the window here.

01:05:58.743 --> 01:06:00.411
Turn it off.

01:06:01.412 --> 01:06:02.538
We got to save them.

01:06:02.747 --> 01:06:04.123
They'll have a trap.

01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:07.919
But they're expecting me,
not all of us.

01:06:08.378 --> 01:06:09.837
All of what? I do laundry.

01:06:10.296 --> 01:06:13.299
I ironed during the Gulf War.
I ain't cut out for this.

01:06:13.508 --> 01:06:15.385
You're in the Navy, remember?

01:06:15.635 --> 01:06:17.720
"It's not a job, it's an adventure."

01:06:18.096 --> 01:06:20.556
To hell with that.
I'm on the college program.

01:06:20.807 --> 01:06:22.100
I'm in.

01:06:24.268 --> 01:06:26.688
All right,
I'll stay and watch Miss July.

01:06:26.896 --> 01:06:30.066
- Get the lights out in broadway.
- I'm going.

01:06:30.316 --> 01:06:32.902
Okay, but the emergency lights
will kick on soon.

01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:36.447
All right, what the hell.
How does this work?

01:06:55.425 --> 01:06:56.467
Go!

01:07:15.653 --> 01:07:16.946
Take cover! Get down!

01:07:20.491 --> 01:07:22.118
Turn it!

01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:25.913
Turn the water off!

01:07:28.249 --> 01:07:30.418
They're going to get us out!

01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:38.509
Pull him out of there!
Pull him out!

01:07:44.474 --> 01:07:46.017
Come on, buddy!

01:07:46.934 --> 01:07:47.977
Breathe!

01:07:48.519 --> 01:07:50.146
Listen to him!

01:07:50.396 --> 01:07:51.898
Hang in there!

01:07:55.943 --> 01:07:59.072
Listen, he freed a few men,
and I think...

01:07:59.322 --> 01:08:03.493
...they went into the fo 'c's 'le,
but we got them pinned down.

01:08:03.743 --> 01:08:05.870
Kill them if you can't contain them.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:07.580
It worked. They're trapped.

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.374
- Good.
- Drop the anchor!

01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:24.889
This is where it's going to happen.

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:35.899
- Who the hell's this?
- Who the hell's this?

01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:40.321
This is Admiral Bates.
I'm trying to get ahold of Ryback.

01:08:40.571 --> 01:08:43.323
He's in a gunfight.
I'll have to take a message.

01:08:43.991 --> 01:08:45.283
What's going on there?

01:08:46.243 --> 01:08:48.621
Hold on.
Here.

01:08:50.915 --> 01:08:52.250
Yes, sir.

01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:55.545
Chief Ryback, this is Admiral Bates.

01:08:55.795 --> 01:08:59.298
I see that you completely
disobeyed my orders. Correct?

01:08:59.549 --> 01:09:02.385
Sorry. You can court-martial me
if I live.

01:09:02.635 --> 01:09:03.594
I see.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.264
Listen to me carefully.

01:09:06.555 --> 01:09:09.100
SEAL Team 5 is en route.
You understand?

01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:14.397
Nimitz air group is our backup.
Understand?

01:09:17.608 --> 01:09:20.944
Now, since your ass is on the line,
I authorize you...

01:09:21.194 --> 01:09:25.116
...to do whatever you can
to aid the arrival of the SEALs.

01:09:25.366 --> 01:09:28.036
Because if I goddamn
can't control you...

01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:31.288
...I might as well support you.
Correct?

01:09:31.456 --> 01:09:32.497
Affirmative.

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:37.920
Good luck there, sailor.
I'm out.

01:09:38.962 --> 01:09:41.341
They got a lot of trouble on that ship.

01:09:47.095 --> 01:09:48.139
Here I go.

01:10:03.863 --> 01:10:05.448
I'm not staying here.

01:10:05.698 --> 01:10:07.909
Where're you going? Get back here.

01:10:18.795 --> 01:10:22.006
- What're you doing?
- The safest place is behind you.

01:10:23.091 --> 01:10:25.259
Hug the wall.
Get out of the middle!

01:10:25.551 --> 01:10:27.970
Miss July, come back here!

01:12:04.108 --> 01:12:08.112
TAG leader, this is Cobra escort.
We have you in our sights.

01:12:08.321 --> 01:12:10.865
You should see us
on your portside now.

01:12:18.581 --> 01:12:22.543
Francois, put the money in the Zurich
bank now, or nothing'll happen.

01:12:24.754 --> 01:12:27.131
Sell what we got
in MacGregor Aircraft.

01:12:27.382 --> 01:12:29.926
It'll go to shit
when they find out about this.

01:12:31.177 --> 01:12:33.471
Two choppers trying to sneak in
under our radar.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.722
Strike team.

01:12:35.973 --> 01:12:38.393
We drive a hard bargain for hard value.

01:12:42.522 --> 01:12:47.068
You give me any more trouble,
I'll call Mohammed. Understand?

01:12:47.276 --> 01:12:49.320
Strike team is in range and locked on.

01:12:49.612 --> 01:12:50.655
Kill them.

01:12:50.905 --> 01:12:54.075
Not you, Francois.
I'll put my accountant on the line...

01:12:54.283 --> 01:12:56.703
...with my account number.
Talk to that frog.

01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:03.126
Something's wrong.

01:13:03.376 --> 01:13:07.296
We've got a big problem here.
Switch to auxiliary!

01:13:07.588 --> 01:13:08.631
Nothing.

01:13:13.011 --> 01:13:15.680
Shit, I lost the phalanx.
We're sitting ducks.

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:17.890
Get me secure to the sub.

01:13:24.105 --> 01:13:25.231
Sub's up.

01:13:25.648 --> 01:13:27.942
Coyote, this is Roadrunner. Come in.

01:13:51.716 --> 01:13:53.509
Here come the good guys.

01:13:59.932 --> 01:14:01.267
One minute!

01:14:01.517 --> 01:14:02.560
One minute!

01:14:03.394 --> 01:14:07.315
The fantail's fouled up!
We're going in on the bow.

01:14:14.489 --> 01:14:16.616
What the hell was that?!

01:14:38.638 --> 01:14:40.932
It's confirmed. We lost them all.

01:14:42.642 --> 01:14:44.727
We have no choice now...

01:14:47.897 --> 01:14:50.650
...but full air assault from the Nimitz.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.863
Mr. Trenton,
would you please?

01:14:58.199 --> 01:15:01.244
We need more hands on deck
to help tie this sub up.

01:15:01.703 --> 01:15:02.787
Start offloading.

01:15:03.037 --> 01:15:07.375
The crane isn't finished.
We got another problem below decks.

01:15:07.583 --> 01:15:12.171
Pull four men off the welding crew
to help tie up the sub.

01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:28.938
My goodness!

01:15:32.066 --> 01:15:36.446
Daumer, Daumer, Daumer.
Why didn't you hire this person?

01:15:36.654 --> 01:15:40.616
Whatever his price would've been,
it would've been worth it.

01:16:26.329 --> 01:16:27.830
Bring it up!

01:16:28.748 --> 01:16:31.167
Ease it over now.

01:18:07.096 --> 01:18:09.098
There's someone in the water!

01:18:10.767 --> 01:18:11.934
Behind you!

01:18:12.352 --> 01:18:14.187
I saw someone in the water!

01:18:24.113 --> 01:18:25.239
Hook him!

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.160
Hook that son of a bitch!

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:46.344
Check for a bomb!

01:19:02.527 --> 01:19:04.696
Who saw him? Come on!

01:19:27.176 --> 01:19:28.636
You're incredible.

01:19:30.555 --> 01:19:33.266
It's a shame
you're not cooking for us.

01:19:47.822 --> 01:19:49.574
Next thing I know...

01:19:50.533 --> 01:19:52.994
...you'll be dating musicians.

01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:08.968
Where's Daumer?

01:20:09.344 --> 01:20:10.887
Probably dead.

01:20:11.763 --> 01:20:13.514
The bowplane is jammed.

01:20:13.806 --> 01:20:14.974
We can't submerge.

01:20:17.977 --> 01:20:20.938
I'll handle it.
It'll be operational underway.

01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:23.524
You fix it, I'll make you an admiral.

01:20:23.775 --> 01:20:25.818
Done. Where're you going?

01:20:26.361 --> 01:20:29.989
- Make Honolulu glow in the dark.
- Outstanding.

01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:33.242
I'll meet you 15 miles
due south in the captain's launch.

01:20:33.993 --> 01:20:36.454
Rally your men here in zero one.

01:20:36.704 --> 01:20:41.626
I need an acetylene torch,
an arc welder and a crowbar, now!

01:20:44.087 --> 01:20:45.588
- What'd he say?
- He can't fix it.

01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:48.341
I'll fix it! Go! Now!

01:20:49.842 --> 01:20:51.386
Why can't you speak English?

01:20:56.849 --> 01:20:58.559
Hang in there.

01:21:19.455 --> 01:21:20.790
Talk to me.

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:23.710
There's nothing to say.

01:21:24.877 --> 01:21:26.587
Whatever they did...

01:21:27.213 --> 01:21:29.215
...they're smarter than I am.

01:21:29.966 --> 01:21:31.551
Everything's dead.

01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:33.261
It's hopeless.

01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:36.139
Nothing is hopeless. Take heart.

01:21:40.643 --> 01:21:42.645
Give me time, I'll figure it out.

01:21:43.271 --> 01:21:45.898
I like your attitude. Excellent.

01:21:50.319 --> 01:21:51.612
It's clear.

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:58.619
What the hell...?

01:22:02.165 --> 01:22:05.501
I'll put it to you in plain English.
It is so simple.

01:22:06.044 --> 01:22:08.087
Hammer that rod into place.

01:22:08.338 --> 01:22:11.257
Weld it over the bowplane.
Without it, we can't survive.

01:22:11.507 --> 01:22:13.593
Make him understand. Now!

01:22:24.437 --> 01:22:25.897
Where's Johnson?

01:22:26.773 --> 01:22:27.815
He's gone.

01:22:28.066 --> 01:22:29.776
They can't get away with this!

01:22:30.193 --> 01:22:31.819
What about the five-inch guns?

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:36.616
We offloaded all the armor-piercing
rounds. We got starbursts.

01:22:36.866 --> 01:22:38.576
Nothing that will penetrate.

01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:46.793
Gunner's mate.

01:22:47.293 --> 01:22:48.336
See those?

01:22:50.129 --> 01:22:52.465
We still got shells for those.

01:23:05.895 --> 01:23:07.355
I did it.

01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:11.275
It's charging. In a few minutes
we'll have power to fire.

01:23:11.526 --> 01:23:12.652
Well done.

01:23:20.284 --> 01:23:21.577
Let's go!

01:23:25.081 --> 01:23:27.834
Get on those last three bags!

01:23:30.503 --> 01:23:31.546
Out of line.

01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:34.966
- Another one.
- Watch my hand signals!

01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:37.051
Stand clear!

01:23:42.223 --> 01:23:43.933
Easy, guys, easy.

01:23:54.485 --> 01:23:56.612
What's the sub's course and speed?

01:23:57.196 --> 01:23:59.407
Course 172. Speed six knots.

01:23:59.907 --> 01:24:02.744
Get down the five-inch guns!

01:24:02.952 --> 01:24:06.330
- What do you want me to do?
- See those black switches?

01:24:06.581 --> 01:24:10.585
- Click them on, one by one.
- If the sub blows, won't the nukes go?

01:24:10.793 --> 01:24:12.712
No. They won't detonate.

01:24:12.962 --> 01:24:14.213
Just sink with the sub.

01:24:14.464 --> 01:24:15.506
Lower the cradle.

01:24:16.090 --> 01:24:17.592
Cradle lowered.

01:24:17.842 --> 01:24:20.219
- Ram the projectile.
- Easy.

01:24:21.637 --> 01:24:23.473
Ram the powder easy.

01:24:23.723 --> 01:24:24.766
Real easy!

01:24:25.933 --> 01:24:27.185
Starbursts are ready.

01:24:27.518 --> 01:24:28.728
Fire starburst!

01:24:30.855 --> 01:24:31.981
All right.

01:24:32.231 --> 01:24:35.526
You, secure this room.
Get back to work, jack-off!

01:24:38.446 --> 01:24:40.198
They're firing at us!

01:24:40.782 --> 01:24:42.116
They're just desperate.

01:24:42.533 --> 01:24:46.829
Those are starbursts.
They don't have shells to hurt us.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.915
204 degrees, Calaway.

01:24:54.253 --> 01:24:55.505
Elevate the barrel.

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.840
028 degrees.

01:25:07.016 --> 01:25:08.226
Fire in the hole.

01:25:19.153 --> 01:25:21.656
He's doing it! We're out of time!

01:25:21.864 --> 01:25:24.033
They're reloading right now.

01:25:24.283 --> 01:25:25.576
Granger, Tackman! Reload!

01:25:29.664 --> 01:25:30.915
Lowering cradle.

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:32.458
Scoot over!

01:25:35.837 --> 01:25:37.171
Goddamn!

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:38.423
Close the breech.

01:25:39.757 --> 01:25:42.552
Lower it. Lower the bowplane!

01:25:44.804 --> 01:25:48.182
Pull! It's working! It's working!
Come on, let's go.

01:25:48.433 --> 01:25:49.809
241 degrees.

01:25:50.184 --> 01:25:51.602
241 degrees back.

01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:53.604
Dive!

01:25:58.443 --> 01:25:59.652
It's working!

01:25:59.902 --> 01:26:02.947
- 204 degrees.
- 204 degrees.

01:26:03.322 --> 01:26:04.574
This is it.

01:26:07.785 --> 01:26:09.829
Ryback is gone.

01:26:11.581 --> 01:26:12.665
Let me look.

01:26:16.169 --> 01:26:17.253
Fire in the hole!

01:26:33.686 --> 01:26:35.813
- Direct hit!
- We hit it!

01:26:41.402 --> 01:26:43.821
What the hell is going on?

01:26:51.537 --> 01:26:55.166
Porky pig. Little red fucker
with the mustache.

01:27:00.922 --> 01:27:02.423
All of my life...

01:27:02.924 --> 01:27:05.176
...Saturday morning cartoons.

01:27:05.426 --> 01:27:06.761
The best.

01:27:08.388 --> 01:27:09.430
Shit.

01:27:12.517 --> 01:27:13.893
For example...

01:27:14.143 --> 01:27:18.481
...remember those two little shrimps
coming in, riding seahorses...

01:27:18.815 --> 01:27:20.733
...little chaps, little pistols?

01:27:20.983 --> 01:27:23.111
Shooting over their shoulders.

01:27:23.569 --> 01:27:25.780
Rescue that lobster from the...

01:27:26.823 --> 01:27:28.282
...Swedish cook.

01:27:28.616 --> 01:27:30.660
Funniest thing I ever saw!

01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:32.787
- Splendid work, by the way.
- Strannix!

01:27:33.037 --> 01:27:34.706
Splendid work!

01:27:34.998 --> 01:27:36.332
My, my, my...

01:27:36.624 --> 01:27:39.419
...how hell doth quicken the spirit.

01:27:40.795 --> 01:27:42.922
- Tomahawks!
- They're up and ready.

01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:44.173
Where?

01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.135
- Fire control.
- Of course! The fire control.

01:27:47.593 --> 01:27:50.054
Chips and dips on the weather deck.

01:27:50.388 --> 01:27:53.474
Motor launch is waiting!
All hands!

01:27:57.645 --> 01:27:59.397
Clear out of here!

01:28:00.982 --> 01:28:02.191
Let's go.

01:28:04.444 --> 01:28:05.486
Four minutes.

01:28:06.738 --> 01:28:08.906
Meet us at the motor launch.

01:28:09.115 --> 01:28:10.783
Four little minutes.

01:28:13.244 --> 01:28:14.412
Home run.

01:28:17.665 --> 01:28:19.000
We did it!

01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:21.336
This little piggy went to market.

01:28:22.837 --> 01:28:24.922
This little piggy stayed home.

01:28:25.673 --> 01:28:27.216
And this little piggy...

01:28:27.633 --> 01:28:30.011
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

01:28:33.556 --> 01:28:35.683
All the way home!

01:28:59.791 --> 01:29:01.209
Happy trails.

01:29:02.919 --> 01:29:05.672
In the captain's launch,
there's the MX 20-20...

01:29:05.922 --> 01:29:09.008
...the SEAL magnaphone.
Bring it here. Take her with you.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.718
The car phone.

01:29:21.396 --> 01:29:22.438
Admiral?

01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:26.109
The Nimitz is tracking two Tomahawks
launched from the ship.

01:29:26.359 --> 01:29:27.860
- Where're they headed?
- Honolulu.

01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:29.320
Oh, God.

01:29:29.737 --> 01:29:32.949
- What's the flight time?
- 24 minutes, sir.

01:29:33.741 --> 01:29:38.079
- Can we destroy them in the air?
- Destruct codes are on the Missouri.

01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:40.957
Scramble Navy and Air Force
fighters from Pearl.

01:29:41.207 --> 01:29:45.503
What are the consequences
of missiles dropping on Honolulu?

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:50.383
About a million people will reach
10,000 degrees Fahrenheit...

01:29:50.633 --> 01:29:52.343
...in less than a second.

01:29:56.973 --> 01:29:58.433
Mr. Secretary...

01:29:58.975 --> 01:30:02.061
We'll just blame it on the cook.

01:30:02.854 --> 01:30:04.230
Absolutely.

01:30:09.318 --> 01:30:10.862
Take it north.

01:30:11.738 --> 01:30:13.573
Roger that. Heading north.

01:31:42.161 --> 01:31:43.621
I'll take that weapon.

01:31:44.539 --> 01:31:45.790
Quietly.

01:31:46.624 --> 01:31:47.709
Now.

01:31:57.635 --> 01:31:59.220
You look familiar.

01:31:59.595 --> 01:32:01.222
I know you, don't I?

01:32:01.472 --> 01:32:03.141
I think you do.

01:32:06.019 --> 01:32:07.061
Been a long time.

01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:08.980
Yes, sir. It has.

01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:10.314
Turn around.

01:32:11.566 --> 01:32:13.568
We'll have a tour. Step forward.

01:32:17.572 --> 01:32:18.865
Here we have...

01:32:19.115 --> 01:32:20.616
...our Tomahawks...

01:32:21.159 --> 01:32:24.495
...speeding their way to the sunny
Aloha State. Turn around.

01:32:25.413 --> 01:32:26.622
As you see...

01:32:27.874 --> 01:32:29.375
...there will be no return.

01:32:29.876 --> 01:32:31.336
And I got the key.

01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:34.047
The lock is broken. Step forward.

01:32:34.297 --> 01:32:35.840
Sit over there.

01:32:36.841 --> 01:32:39.677
You'll watch
the end of the world on TV.

01:32:40.928 --> 01:32:42.347
Put your feet up.

01:32:42.597 --> 01:32:43.765
Relax.

01:32:47.018 --> 01:32:48.436
You know, you're good.

01:32:49.354 --> 01:32:51.022
You are really good.

01:32:51.439 --> 01:32:53.358
It's a shame to kill you.

01:32:54.692 --> 01:32:56.778
Behold my finest work.

01:32:57.028 --> 01:32:59.072
Do me a favor.
Tell me something.

01:32:59.781 --> 01:33:03.326
You really think blowing up
a bunch of innocent people...

01:33:03.785 --> 01:33:05.370
...will change anything?

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.205
What made you flip like this?

01:33:07.413 --> 01:33:10.625
I got tired of coming up with
desperate solutions...

01:33:10.875 --> 01:33:14.087
...to impossible problems
created by other people.

01:33:14.337 --> 01:33:18.299
All your ridiculous,
pitiful antics won't change a thing.

01:33:18.549 --> 01:33:20.009
You and I...

01:33:20.635 --> 01:33:23.596
...we're puppets
in the same sick play.

01:33:24.180 --> 01:33:25.723
We serve the same master...

01:33:27.058 --> 01:33:31.521
...and he's an ungrateful lunatic.
There's nothing we can do about it.

01:33:31.896 --> 01:33:33.314
You and I are the same.

01:33:33.523 --> 01:33:36.401
No. There's a difference, my man.

01:33:37.610 --> 01:33:39.862
You have faith. I don't.

01:34:35.126 --> 01:34:37.378
Keep the faith, Strannix.

01:34:46.804 --> 01:34:48.806
Locked on my nose, 15 miles.

01:34:53.227 --> 01:34:55.897
Five miles, on target.
Weapon status, clear.

01:34:56.397 --> 01:34:57.690
Roger.

01:35:03.696 --> 01:35:04.739
Admiral...

01:35:07.283 --> 01:35:08.993
They intercepted one missile.

01:35:09.619 --> 01:35:10.787
And the other one?

01:35:11.037 --> 01:35:12.497
It slipped through.

01:35:30.306 --> 01:35:31.474
Chief...

01:35:31.766 --> 01:35:36.104
...we've only got time for one shot.
So we'll do it by the numbers.

01:35:37.063 --> 01:35:38.648
Load the disk.

01:35:38.898 --> 01:35:40.566
Now punch 4-7.

01:35:40.775 --> 01:35:42.527
You're now on KU.

01:35:45.697 --> 01:35:48.157
Code is 6, 4...

01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:50.326
...3, 5...

01:35:50.702 --> 01:35:52.495
...0, 0.

01:35:52.745 --> 01:35:56.165
That's 643500.
Is my read-back correct?

01:35:56.416 --> 01:35:57.500
Affirmative.

01:36:08.511 --> 01:36:09.554
Stand by.

01:36:31.868 --> 01:36:34.329
Got it!
Nimitz is no longer tracking.

01:36:36.205 --> 01:36:37.582
Good man, Ryback!

01:36:42.211 --> 01:36:45.506
Sir, call off your bombers.
Call off your bombers.

01:36:46.007 --> 01:36:49.344
We're calling off the aircraft.
We're calling them off.

01:36:49.594 --> 01:36:52.388
Thanks, Ryback. Great job!
Great job!

01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:57.185
Want to go swimming?
I got a Zodiac and some C-rays...

01:36:57.769 --> 01:36:59.562
...a little umbrella...

01:36:59.812 --> 01:37:01.105
I'll go with you.

01:37:04.317 --> 01:37:06.944
She's all right! She's all right!

01:37:08.696 --> 01:37:10.990
Good, good, all of you guys.

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.283
Great!

01:37:12.909 --> 01:37:14.202
Good job!

01:37:18.915 --> 01:37:21.668
Hold on in there,
we'll get you out in a minute!
