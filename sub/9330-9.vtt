WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.766
Ben: This is such a sweet ride.

00:03.564 --> 00:05.414
I haven't ridden one of
these babies in years.

00:08.769 --> 00:10.269
Hey, there you are.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.704
Yeah, it looks safe to me, Emma.

00:13.423 --> 00:16.325
So, guess which adorable neighbor,
who you should totally date,

00:16.360 --> 00:18.294
- I just had lunch with?
- Zoey.

00:18.345 --> 00:19.779
Oh, my god, it's like
talking to you in a dress.

00:19.781 --> 00:22.565
You two are practically the same person.

00:22.599 --> 00:23.649
I'm not going out with her.

00:23.684 --> 00:25.601
You guys are perfect for each other.

00:25.636 --> 00:27.486
She's mature.

00:27.521 --> 00:28.571
She has her head screwed on right.

00:28.605 --> 00:30.423
She's a grown-up.

00:30.457 --> 00:33.342
You honestly have no idea what men
find attractive about women, do you?

00:34.394 --> 00:35.428
How about I show you?

00:35.479 --> 00:37.330
Do you remember Sam?

00:38.365 --> 00:39.398
The girl of my dreams...

00:39.433 --> 00:40.733
Yeah, we're sleeping together.

00:40.784 --> 00:42.802
Yeah, in separate rooms,

00:42.836 --> 00:44.737
which is what we call a roommate.

00:45.839 --> 00:47.640
Ben, move on.

00:47.674 --> 00:48.774
Or move on up...

00:48.776 --> 00:51.594
to the sixth floor, where Zoey lives.

00:52.663 --> 00:54.547
Again, it's not gonna happen.

00:54.581 --> 00:57.516
Other than both being single parents,
we pretty much have nothing in common.

00:58.535 --> 01:01.420
Oh. You hang out up here, too. Perfect.

01:01.422 --> 01:04.307
Well, at least I don't steal
t-shirts from the laundry room.

01:04.340 --> 01:05.424
That's my Frontier Surgeons shirt.

01:05.459 --> 01:07.360
Uh, no. It's mine.

01:07.411 --> 01:08.427
I love them.

01:08.462 --> 01:10.296
First concert that I ever went to.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.748
No way! That was my first
concert. Madison Square Garden.

01:12.799 --> 01:15.267
- Wait, Christmas 2006?
- Yeah.

01:15.319 --> 01:16.702
Oh, my god, how amazing is this?

01:16.737 --> 01:19.622
I mean, what are the chances that
you two would have so much in common?

01:19.656 --> 01:22.541
A lot. Because you're
perfect for each other.

01:22.576 --> 01:23.542
Ow! Ow!

01:23.593 --> 01:25.511
Emma... Oh! That
was my foot.

01:26.596 --> 01:27.546
Nice work, Emma.

- (Riley scoffs)
- Riley, stop.

01:41.561 --> 01:43.562
I have no interest in going
out with Zoey whatsoever.

01:43.613 --> 01:44.697
Well, obviously.

01:44.731 --> 01:45.731
I mean, if you did, I wouldn't have

01:45.782 --> 01:46.732
to keep bothering you about it.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.736
Ben, I love you. And I might feel

01:50.738 --> 01:52.738
just a titch guilty about,

01:52.740 --> 01:54.707
like, one or two things
that happened between us.

01:55.792 --> 01:57.576
Really, just a titch?

01:58.745 --> 02:00.713
My point is I want you to be happy,

02:00.747 --> 02:03.582
and sometimes the
person we think we want

02:03.633 --> 02:05.468
isn't the person who's right for us.

02:05.502 --> 02:07.586
Is that how you sold it to
yourself when you dumped me?

02:07.588 --> 02:09.555
Oh, my god. Okay. Look.

02:09.589 --> 02:11.507
The only reason you
think you don't want Zoey

02:11.558 --> 02:12.758
is because she's available.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.511
Right? If she had guys chasing
after her, you'd be all like,

02:15.562 --> 02:18.481
(deep voice) "See ya,
Sam. Oh, hey, Zoey."

02:19.516 --> 02:20.599
Or even better...
bye, Riley.

02:22.569 --> 02:25.571
Oh! And what's-his-name
misses the shot!

02:25.605 --> 02:27.606
The puck's over there.
No, it's over there!

02:27.608 --> 02:28.657
Now it's over there!

02:29.743 --> 02:30.743
What are you doing?

02:30.777 --> 02:32.611
Oh, hey, bro.

02:32.662 --> 02:33.746
Just practicing a
little play-by-play.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.532
Think I'm a natural.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.534
Don't get offended if
I practice ignoring you.

02:38.585 --> 02:40.586
I'm a natural at that.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.622
It's Ben and Emma around the
couch. Will they stop for milk?

02:43.673 --> 02:45.624
Nope, it's straight to the bedroom.

02:45.675 --> 02:47.626
It's naptime here in apartment 4D.

02:48.712 --> 02:50.546
What up, chicken butt?

02:50.597 --> 02:52.681
Oh. It's Mom, out of nowhere!

02:52.716 --> 02:54.550
She's across the room in a flash.

02:54.601 --> 02:55.718
Who's her target?

02:55.769 --> 02:58.604
Yes, the Chardonnay takes the hit!

02:59.723 --> 03:00.639
What do you think?

03:01.691 --> 03:03.526
I think a lot of things,

03:03.560 --> 03:06.595
but I'm not crazy, so I
don't say them all out loud.

03:06.646 --> 03:08.550
No, I'm thinking about
getting into sports

03:08.576 --> 03:10.499
commentating when my
hockey career is over.

03:10.534 --> 03:11.534
It's a great idea, right?

03:11.568 --> 03:13.436
Mmm.

03:13.470 --> 03:17.273
Yeah, I'm not sure "great"
is the word we're looking for,

03:17.324 --> 03:19.759
but it is definitely an idea.

03:19.793 --> 03:20.760
Nailed it.

03:21.778 --> 03:23.729
Oh, so you don't believe in me either?

03:23.780 --> 03:26.332
That's exactly what my manager said.

03:26.334 --> 03:27.683
What?

03:27.717 --> 03:31.620
No one tells my baby
what he can or can't do.

03:31.655 --> 03:32.671
That's my job.

03:34.574 --> 03:35.624
Screw your new manager.

03:35.659 --> 03:37.510
You need your old mom-ager.

03:37.561 --> 03:39.578
If there's one thing I know how to do,

03:39.613 --> 03:40.663
it's help make your dreams come true.

03:40.697 --> 03:43.632
Except the one time the
Make-A-Wish Foundation

03:43.667 --> 03:46.402
called my bluff and they
made us return that pony.

03:48.538 --> 03:50.489
(knocking on window)

03:52.459 --> 03:54.293
You know, I had a dream just like this,

03:54.344 --> 03:55.778
except Tucker was standing
on an airplane wing.

03:58.782 --> 04:00.683
What? Oh, okay.

04:02.269 --> 04:03.702
- Thank you, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Yeah.

04:03.753 --> 04:05.671
Danny, this window's sticking again.

04:05.722 --> 04:07.573
I've called Julio six times

04:07.607 --> 04:08.607
and he still has not fixed it.

04:08.609 --> 04:11.510
Maybe it's because the
super's name is Warren.

04:12.662 --> 04:14.430
Really?

04:15.515 --> 04:18.300
Because I gave our apartment
key to a guy named Julio.

04:18.334 --> 04:19.351
Really?

04:19.386 --> 04:21.320
What were you doing out there, anyway?

04:21.353 --> 04:23.739
Oh. So, I was rehearsing
for an audition,

04:23.773 --> 04:25.691
to be WNY-8's new weather man.

04:25.742 --> 04:29.311
Cloudy with a chance of Tucker.

04:29.346 --> 04:31.630
Wait, wait. I thought you wanted
to be an entertainment reporter?

04:31.665 --> 04:33.699
I do! This is a stepping stone.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.619
Today the sun, tomorrow the stars.

04:36.653 --> 04:37.670
God, I'm good!

04:39.689 --> 04:41.640
Oh, my god! This is perfect!

04:41.675 --> 04:44.643
If WNY-8's gonna let this
nobody do the weather,

04:44.678 --> 04:47.446
it would let this
somebody do the sports!

04:47.448 --> 04:49.548
New York Ranger Danny
Wheeler. I'm a genius!

04:51.568 --> 04:53.469
How did my good news become about you?

04:53.503 --> 04:54.436
It's a gift.

04:55.822 --> 04:57.373
(elevator dings)

04:57.407 --> 04:59.358
Riley: This is us.

04:59.409 --> 05:01.710
I still can't believe Riley
Perrin is setting me up.

05:01.761 --> 05:04.580
To be honest, I was pretty sure
you didn't even know who I was.

05:05.715 --> 05:07.249
Of course I know.

05:07.284 --> 05:08.684
You're the guy who's
desk I pass everyday.

05:10.587 --> 05:12.521
Hey, Ben. Hey, is Zoey here?

05:12.556 --> 05:14.623
Um, no, but that's only
because she doesn't live here.

05:15.675 --> 05:18.427
Oh. Oh, this is Rick. He's a lawyer.

05:18.461 --> 05:20.579
Yeah, he and Zoey are
kind of becoming an item.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.514
Actually, it's Roger.

05:22.566 --> 05:26.335
I'm a paralegal, and I
haven't even met her yet.

05:27.404 --> 05:29.255
But you will. You will.

05:29.306 --> 05:31.657
And then I'll be all like, "Get
a room, you two." Am I right?

05:32.692 --> 05:33.692
I haven't even seen a picture.

05:35.328 --> 05:36.695
Hope it works out for you, Rog.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.614
Hey, maybe we can all go
on a double date sometime

05:38.665 --> 05:39.632
with me and my girlfriend, Sam.

05:39.634 --> 05:41.517
Roommate, she's your roommate.

05:41.568 --> 05:43.535
Not for long, okay?

05:43.587 --> 05:46.472
Tonight, I'm going to be grilling
some steaks when she gets home,

05:46.474 --> 05:48.457
we'll watch the sunset, have a drink.

05:48.491 --> 05:50.476
Then by the time the sun rises,

05:50.510 --> 05:52.411
this cock-a-doodle
will do.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.301
No. No, no, no.

06:03.340 --> 06:04.673
Aw, I'm so sorry.

06:04.724 --> 06:06.659
I really thought Zoey was going
to be here. Okay, bye, Randy!

06:08.345 --> 06:09.628
Honey, hi.

06:09.679 --> 06:10.729
Where are you going?

06:10.780 --> 06:13.666
I've got a meeting about
doing sports for WNY-8.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.567
Oh, my god.

06:15.602 --> 06:18.621
You talking on camera, that's so...

06:18.672 --> 06:19.638
Great?

06:19.640 --> 06:21.490
Great, yes. Oh!

06:22.626 --> 06:25.361
Oh, crap. I forgot to
tell Ben that Sam called.

06:25.395 --> 06:27.413
I'm sorry, Sam called
you? Why did Sam call you?

06:27.464 --> 06:30.316
Because she works for me.

06:30.350 --> 06:32.451
She's not gonna be home tonight because
she's going camping with friends.

06:32.485 --> 06:34.303
And she asked if I would cover for her.

06:35.322 --> 06:36.705
Okay, wait. Danny, hello.

06:36.740 --> 06:38.674
I mean, your career needs to come first.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.693
You don't want to be
late for your big meeting.

06:40.727 --> 06:42.711
So I'll tell Ben that Sam won't be
home tonight. All right? Good luck.

06:42.746 --> 06:44.647
Aw, thanks, babe. You're the best.

06:48.585 --> 06:49.702
- Yes, I am the best.
- (Elevator dings)

06:53.556 --> 06:55.407
I think I pressed the wrong button.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.299
So tonight, expect low temperatures

07:03.350 --> 07:04.566
and increasing clouds.

07:04.601 --> 07:07.686
I'm Tucker Dobbs, making
predictions with convictions.

07:07.721 --> 07:09.321
(laughs)

07:09.323 --> 07:11.256
Let's go to Agnes in
the traffic chopper.

07:11.308 --> 07:12.608
What's up, Agnes? Besides you.

07:14.327 --> 07:15.678
This is the chance of a lifetime.

07:15.712 --> 07:18.697
"WNY-8 news, with Dallas
Goldberg, Pamela Bishop,

07:18.699 --> 07:21.633
and New York Ranger
Danny Wheeler on sports."

07:21.635 --> 07:23.502
Look, Bonnie,

07:23.536 --> 07:25.454
if I was the kind of
guy who took chances,

07:25.505 --> 07:27.456
I'd be married to my
college roommate's mom

07:27.490 --> 07:28.440
and we'd be living in Boca right now.

07:29.592 --> 07:32.311
But the only opening we
have right now is in weather.

07:32.362 --> 07:34.346
So don't listen to those other snobs,

07:34.381 --> 07:36.348
get your weather from Tucker Dobbs.

07:38.418 --> 07:39.735
Oh, man! Dude!

07:39.769 --> 07:41.403
That was an awesome audition.

07:41.438 --> 07:43.339
I totally believed it
was going to rain today.

07:44.758 --> 07:46.325
It is.

07:47.660 --> 07:50.596
There he is. Looks like we've
found our new weather man.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.531
Oh, my god, really?

07:52.565 --> 07:53.615
Congratulations, Danny.

07:53.650 --> 07:55.467
Welcome aboard.

07:55.502 --> 07:56.602
Me? Why?

07:56.653 --> 07:58.454
Him? Why?

07:58.488 --> 08:00.522
Okay, you know what? Don't ask
questions we don't have answers to.

08:00.557 --> 08:02.474
- Let's go, Danny.
- But I don't want to do the weather.

08:02.476 --> 08:03.792
Yes, you do. You love weather!

08:03.827 --> 08:05.427
- What did you do, Mom?
- I kept my shirt on the whole time!

08:08.398 --> 08:10.249
Steaks grilling.

08:11.284 --> 08:13.252
Sun setting.

08:13.286 --> 08:14.219
Bottle opener

08:14.270 --> 08:15.287
forgetting.

08:17.707 --> 08:18.707
(groans)

08:18.742 --> 08:20.609
Anybody there?

Advertise your product or brand here

08:30.453 --> 08:31.470
Hey, Zoey.

08:31.504 --> 08:33.472
Ben, hi. What are you doing?

08:33.523 --> 08:35.506
I'm locked out of my
apartment and I have a date.

08:35.542 --> 08:36.508
Riley: Zoey!

08:36.543 --> 08:38.477
On the fire escape.

08:38.479 --> 08:40.712
Hey, okay. Great news.

08:40.764 --> 08:43.381
Ben doesn't know that Sam's not
coming so he's home alone right now.

08:43.416 --> 08:44.666
- No, he's not.
- Ow!

08:44.701 --> 08:45.717
Ben, hi.

08:46.736 --> 08:48.287
And why isn't Sam coming?

08:48.321 --> 08:49.271
(scoffs)

08:49.305 --> 08:50.639
Did I forget to mention that?

08:50.690 --> 08:52.491
Doesn't matter. Uh, it looks like

08:52.542 --> 08:53.659
you two were in the middle of something.

08:53.661 --> 08:54.643
So, I'm
just gonna...

08:54.677 --> 08:56.695
Really? Tricking me to come up here.

08:56.729 --> 08:58.580
God, I can't believe you two.

08:58.631 --> 09:01.483
(scoffs) Two? I had
nothing to do with this.

09:01.518 --> 09:04.436
Yeah, right. You're practically
throwing yourself at me with that steak.

09:04.438 --> 09:06.455
Oh, my god, you are so full of yourself.

09:06.489 --> 09:08.340
And you're just mad 'cause
your plan didn't work.

09:08.391 --> 09:09.441
Okay, you know, if I
could just interject...

09:09.443 --> 09:11.243
Or better yet, mind your own business.

09:11.245 --> 09:12.344
I do not want to date Ben.

09:12.395 --> 09:14.329
Hey, you're not the
first girl to say that.

09:15.748 --> 09:17.633
Oh, my god. Just go already.

09:17.684 --> 09:19.651
Gladly. I'll get in through the roof.

09:19.653 --> 09:22.554
Oh, Ben, come on. Are
you... Look at the sunset!

09:22.556 --> 09:23.705
(sighs)

09:27.510 --> 09:28.577
First dates are always a little awkward.

09:34.786 --> 09:35.359
Bonnie: Emma!

09:36.231 --> 09:37.398
Emma, sweetie.

09:37.432 --> 09:39.233
Hi!

09:39.267 --> 09:41.614
Hey, honey, listen. We need
to get out of here in a hurry

09:41.714 --> 09:42.764
because I do not
want to run into...

09:42.799 --> 09:43.849
Hello, Mrs. Wheeler.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.151
Oh, Tucker. Hi.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.770
Oh! Listen,

09:48.805 --> 09:50.706
wasn't it crazy

09:50.740 --> 09:53.141
how Tim picked Danny all on his own

09:53.176 --> 09:56.011
without any suggestion
from me whatsoever?

09:56.045 --> 09:58.080
Yeah. Crazy is a good word.

09:58.114 --> 09:59.031
Yeah.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.967
But you know what? I'm fine,

10:02.001 --> 10:04.069
and I am genuinely happy for Danny.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.821
You are?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.839
Yeah, it's not his fault, right?

10:07.874 --> 10:09.791
And you know Danny, he felt horrible.

10:09.826 --> 10:10.926
- Mm-hmm.
- We had a heart-to-heart

10:10.977 --> 10:12.744
and he even offered to walk away.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.912
So...

10:13.947 --> 10:15.731
I just want to tell you

10:15.765 --> 10:17.182
no hard feelings.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.800
Thank you, Tucker.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.140
- Do you think we should trust him?
- Yes.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.992
(scoffs) You always
see the best in people.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.297
(groans)

10:32.332 --> 10:35.067
Hey, Riley, just letting you
know this elevator's going down,

10:35.101 --> 10:36.985
no matter how much you
try to manipulate it.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.987
Ben, I'm sorry, okay.

10:39.022 --> 10:41.873
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about
Sam. It just slipped my mind.

10:41.908 --> 10:42.925
- And you hate her.
- Yeah, there's that.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.746
You honestly have no feelings for Zoey?

10:47.797 --> 10:50.782
Okay, I guess when I saw her on
the fire escape the other night...

10:50.817 --> 10:52.734
Yes, I knew it! You do, I was right.

10:52.769 --> 10:54.136
But calm down.

10:54.170 --> 10:55.771
You're forgetting
something very important.

10:55.805 --> 10:57.039
She's not into me.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.123
- (elevator dings)
- You don't know that.

11:00.109 --> 11:01.109
Well, I do now.

11:04.948 --> 11:06.915
- Riley, hey!
- Hey.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.967
Look who I ran into
in the lobby yesterday.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.003
Your Zoey who's now my Zoey.

11:11.037 --> 11:12.971
We just went to lunch.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.841
So, I'll see you later,

11:15.875 --> 11:16.908
and I'll see you at work.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.811
Can I tell people we're friends?

11:19.846 --> 11:23.815
Ugh. I'd say yes, but that kind of goes
against what I've been telling people.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.138
Wait, so do you actually
like Rick more than Ben?

11:30.173 --> 11:32.040
- His name is Roger...
- Right.

11:32.075 --> 11:33.709
And you supposedly
set me up with him.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.195
But I don't know what
I think about him yet.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.014
It's probably nothing.

11:39.048 --> 11:41.917
Yeah. That was really the
vibe I was getting too.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.875
And we'll be bringing you
more on that story later.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.810
Developing at this hour...

11:51.812 --> 11:53.795
Hey there, Tim-bo.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.814
You ready for a little
weather man magic?

11:55.848 --> 11:58.867
Aw, he'll be great. As long as he
doesn't do what our last weather man did.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.135
- What's that?
- He died.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.687
Oh, god.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.654
Yeah.

12:02.705 --> 12:03.739
- Massive heart attack.
- Oh, my...

12:03.790 --> 12:05.140
- Live on the six o'clock news.
- (Gasps)

12:05.174 --> 12:07.709
Then again, it was the
best ratings we ever had.

12:07.744 --> 12:09.127
Oh.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.931
So, I think our boy is ready to go.

12:12.982 --> 12:13.402
Oh, yeah?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.083
He's a little nervous, but
I walked him through it.

12:15.118 --> 12:17.936
I also jazzed up his
weather report a little bit.

12:19.022 --> 12:20.956
What do you mean you
"jazzed" it up a little bit?

12:22.041 --> 12:23.892
And now a special treat,

12:23.943 --> 12:27.879
weekend weather with New York
Ranger Danny Wheeler. Danny?

12:32.902 --> 12:34.886
Hey, I'm Danny Wheeler,

12:34.921 --> 12:37.773
bringing you weather
in a whole new light.

12:37.807 --> 12:40.175
Today's forecast calls for rain

12:40.209 --> 12:42.728
but hey, look on the bright side,

12:42.762 --> 12:44.012
I always do.

12:45.214 --> 12:47.182
You better hope he has a heart attack.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.971
And I predict the sun ain't
gonna be coming out tomorrow.

12:56.926 --> 12:59.795
Okay, new development, Zoey hates Roger.

12:59.829 --> 13:01.947
I might be paraphrasing, but
that's... Oh, where are you going?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.749
Going camping.

13:03.751 --> 13:04.766
I called Sam with a work problem,

13:04.801 --> 13:06.401
and she mentioned they got rained out,

13:06.436 --> 13:08.837
and she's coming home early, so I'm surprising
her by taking her camping on the roof

13:08.871 --> 13:10.722
to make her feel better.

13:10.724 --> 13:11.857
Pretty romantic, right?

13:12.892 --> 13:14.743
Oh, my god, that is so just...

13:14.777 --> 13:16.728
Yeah, that is pretty romantic.

13:17.830 --> 13:19.131
- No, but...
- Dammit, Riley!

13:19.133 --> 13:21.166
No matter what you say,
I'm pitching a tent for Sam.

13:30.093 --> 13:32.944
(quietly) Hey, Ben,
you forgot your phone.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.900
(clears throat) Okay.

13:40.803 --> 13:41.803
(clears throat)

13:41.838 --> 13:43.738
(deep voice) Hey, Sam.

13:43.773 --> 13:45.757
Sorry your trip got canceled, bummer.

13:47.176 --> 13:50.796
But Riley has an uncle with
a place on the Jersey Shore.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.098
Wanna use it? Yeah,
she said it was cool.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.202
(normal voice) P.S. In the future,

13:57.236 --> 14:00.088
you should always come to
me with any work questions.

14:00.123 --> 14:02.007
Not Danny.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.859
He has a girlfriend.

14:07.046 --> 14:11.917
A super cute, funny, sweet girlfriend.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.902
So...

14:23.969 --> 14:24.936
Hey, what's...

14:24.987 --> 14:26.321
You have got to stop.

14:26.355 --> 14:28.973
I just got off the phone with
Sam, and I know what you did.

14:29.024 --> 14:29.532
I don't know...

14:29.558 --> 14:31.326
No. No, no, no, Riley.
Riley, we're done. Okay?

14:31.360 --> 14:34.195
I have been in love
with Sam since I was 14.

14:34.230 --> 14:35.280
That sound familiar?

14:37.299 --> 14:40.151
And I just want to see if
maybe there's something there.

14:40.153 --> 14:42.153
Please?

14:42.204 --> 14:44.172
If I can get used to the idea
of you being with my brother,

14:44.206 --> 14:46.107
then you can get used to the
idea of me being with Sam.

14:47.243 --> 14:48.977
You're right.

14:49.011 --> 14:50.145
You're right, I'm sorry.

14:50.179 --> 14:53.965
And here. You're taking Emma tonight.

14:54.016 --> 14:56.985
Since I spent all day setting up a
campsite, I'm actually gonna go use it.

14:57.036 --> 14:59.053
Sometimes a man just needs to
go out in nature and be alone.

15:00.356 --> 15:01.322
(elevator dings)

15:02.374 --> 15:04.943
- Riley! Just who I was looking for.
- Hey.

15:04.977 --> 15:07.362
I have this date with Roger tonight
and my babysitter just canceled.

15:07.396 --> 15:09.247
So I was kind
of wondering...

15:09.281 --> 15:11.182
- Sure.
- Awesome.

15:11.184 --> 15:13.168
You are a lifesaver.

15:13.202 --> 15:15.303
Hunter's had this little
cough, but he should be fine.

15:15.337 --> 15:17.105
Thank you.

15:17.139 --> 15:18.239
No problem.

15:18.274 --> 15:20.175
Not like I had anything better to do.

15:22.144 --> 15:23.228
I didn't have anything better to do.

15:27.099 --> 15:29.083
Tucker, what the hell is wrong with you?

15:29.118 --> 15:31.169
I can't believe that you
would do that to Danny.

15:31.203 --> 15:35.907
Wh... Tucker! You're the one that made me
get this stupid job in the first place.

15:35.958 --> 15:38.309
I wanted to be a sportscaster,
not a weather man.

15:38.344 --> 15:41.362
And I told you that I'd give up the
job. Why didn't you let me do that?

15:41.413 --> 15:44.299
I don't know. I was all
hopped up on anger and revenge.

15:45.351 --> 15:47.285
I worked on my audition for days.

15:47.319 --> 15:51.189
Do you know how hard it is to find a
word that rhymes with precipitation?

15:51.240 --> 15:57.028
Um, inspiration, imagination, innovation.
Ooh, three things you don't have.

15:59.181 --> 16:02.000
I am so burning hot right now!

16:03.085 --> 16:04.169
It might just be the outfit.

16:09.909 --> 16:11.009
Danny,

16:11.060 --> 16:14.012
we are blowing up on
social media right now.

16:14.046 --> 16:17.265
Number one comment: What is
that idiot doing in a sun suit?

16:18.317 --> 16:20.285
So yeah, we're not gonna do that again.

16:20.287 --> 16:24.205
Second most popular comment: Why
isn't Danny Wheeler doing sports?

16:24.240 --> 16:26.224
Really? So what does that mean?

16:26.258 --> 16:28.359
It means I fired our sports guy.

16:28.394 --> 16:30.295
Two weeks away from his retirement.

16:31.347 --> 16:33.064
Sucks for him.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.035
And I want you to start
guest hosting right away.

16:37.069 --> 16:39.103
Oh, my god! Thank you!

16:39.154 --> 16:42.040
This totally eclipses the
way I was feeling before.

16:43.158 --> 16:45.043
Yeah, man, don't do that.

16:45.077 --> 16:48.329
Hey, I guess your buddy
Tucker can do the weather.

16:48.364 --> 16:49.998
He was far and away the best candidate.

16:50.032 --> 16:51.349
I'll let him know he's got the job.

16:51.383 --> 16:54.018
No. Wait. Let me do it.

16:54.053 --> 16:55.420
I'd really like to return the favor.

16:57.306 --> 16:58.339
Ow.

17:05.180 --> 17:07.181
I should have known I'd find
you up here, ruining my night.

17:07.215 --> 17:11.135
Which is ironic, because here
you are, ruining my night.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.988
Is this Riley creating another reason
for us to "run" into each other?

17:14.022 --> 17:15.290
No, I'm trying to have a date,

17:15.324 --> 17:18.026
but it keeps being interrupted by
plaster falling from the ceiling

17:18.060 --> 17:19.143
from all of your hammering.

17:19.145 --> 17:21.079
Well, don't worry. That
hammering's about to stop,

17:21.113 --> 17:22.931
because this hammering's about to start.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.384
And what are you doing
with my tent, anyway?

17:26.417 --> 17:28.386
It's not your tent, it's my tent.

17:28.436 --> 17:29.988
Uh, no.

17:29.990 --> 17:32.373
There's a Camp Winnetonka
sticker right here!

17:32.408 --> 17:34.392
Yeah, where I went to
summer camp for three years.

17:34.394 --> 17:35.376
So did I!

17:35.411 --> 17:37.128
Stop doing that!

17:40.232 --> 17:42.166
Oh, my god, Riley says
something's wrong with Hunter.

17:42.217 --> 17:43.268
Yeah, I got the same thing.

17:45.070 --> 17:47.021
Do you think this is her still
trying to get us together?

17:47.056 --> 17:48.106
Obviously.

17:49.191 --> 17:50.975
We should probably go.

17:52.444 --> 17:53.995
(Hunter coughing)

17:54.029 --> 17:55.263
What's wrong?

17:55.297 --> 17:57.131
He keeps coughing. I think
he's having trouble breathing.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.017
Okay, sweetie. Mommy's here.

17:59.019 --> 18:00.868
Oh, my god, what do I do?

18:00.919 --> 18:02.003
He's gonna be okay, I went
through this with Emma.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.888
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't worry, I got this.

18:03.939 --> 18:06.307
Zoey, take Hunter into the bathroom and
turn on the shower as hot as it will go.

18:06.342 --> 18:07.909
Riley, go to my room, grab some towels.

18:07.943 --> 18:09.344
I'll make sure the window
and door are sealed. Let's go!

18:10.396 --> 18:12.146
I'm just saying

18:12.197 --> 18:14.332
if getting the weather job
was that important to you,

18:14.383 --> 18:16.317
you probably should have said something.

18:16.352 --> 18:19.203
Oh! Oh, you mean like when
I told you how important

18:19.238 --> 18:20.254
getting the weather job was to me!

18:20.306 --> 18:22.223
Guys, you're not gonna believe it!

18:22.274 --> 18:24.108
I got the sports gig,

18:24.159 --> 18:27.128
which kinda means that
there's an opening in weather.

18:27.179 --> 18:30.148
And I told Tim that there's
only one person for the job.

18:32.968 --> 18:34.052
Me? Is it me?

18:34.103 --> 18:35.987
- It is.
- Yes!

18:36.038 --> 18:38.923
And he thinks you need a sexy sidekick.

18:38.974 --> 18:41.326
Me? Is it me?

18:41.360 --> 18:43.928
It is, but there's kind of a catch.

Fine.

19:05.117 --> 19:07.935
The cloud can stay but
the lightning better bolt.

19:21.016 --> 19:22.367

19:22.401 --> 19:23.368
What?

19:28.340 --> 19:29.307
(water running)

19:31.393 --> 19:34.178
See, he just needed some
steam to open up his lungs.

19:34.229 --> 19:36.164
He's gonna be fine, aren't you, buddy?

19:37.299 --> 19:38.349
Oh, my god, he's smiling.

19:38.384 --> 19:40.151
(chuckles) Yeah.

19:41.220 --> 19:42.236
He smiles like you.

19:45.174 --> 19:46.207
Thank you, Ben.

19:46.258 --> 19:48.292
You were amazing.

19:48.294 --> 19:50.178
No, it was nothing.

19:50.212 --> 19:51.295
I'm just glad I could help.

19:53.182 --> 19:55.266
Honestly, I don't know what
I would have done without you.

20:05.277 --> 20:07.145
Yes! I was right!

20:12.776 --> 20:14.744

Mom!

20:26.873 --> 20:29.675
Yeah, Agnes had a little accident...

20:30.794 --> 20:32.845
which is actually our top story.

20:35.716 --> 20:36.849
But first, I'd like to start

20:36.883 --> 20:39.635
with a brand new segment called...

20:40.804 --> 20:41.854
Bonnie's Corner.

20:42.939 --> 20:44.774
Now, I know what
you're thinking...

20:44.808 --> 20:46.776
nobody puts Bonnie in the corner!
