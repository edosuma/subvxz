WEBVTT

00:30.239 --> 00:36.203
<i>See them tumbling down</i>

00:36.286 --> 00:40.415
<i>Pledging their love
to the ground</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:43.126
<i>Way out West
there was this fella.</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:45.546
<i>Fella I wanna tell you about.</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:49.091
<i>Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.</i>

00:49.174 --> 00:52.803
<i>Least that was the handle that
his loving parents gave him.</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:55.931
<i>But he never had
much use for it himself.</i>

00:56.014 --> 01:00.060
<i>This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.</i>

01:00.143 --> 01:02.229
<i>Now Dude,</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:05.983
<i>that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:11.446
<i>But then there was a lot about the Dude that
didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,</i>

01:11.530 --> 01:14.199
<i>and a lot about
where he lived likewise.</i>

01:14.283 --> 01:16.451
<i>Drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:18.120
<i>But then again,</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:21.290
<i>maybe that's why I found the
place so darned interesting.</i>

01:21.373 --> 01:23.333
<i>I know when night has gone</i>

01:23.417 --> 01:26.295
<i>That a new world's
born at dawn</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:30.424
<i>They call Los
Angeles the City of Angels.</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:33.552
<i>I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.</i>

01:33.635 --> 01:37.347
<i>But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:40.100
<i>Course, I can't say
I seen London,</i>

01:40.183 --> 01:42.436
<i>and I never been to France,</i>

01:42.519 --> 01:47.566
<i>and I ain't never seen no queen in her
damned undies, as the fella says.</i>

01:47.649 --> 01:49.568
<i>But I'll tell you what,</i>

01:49.651 --> 01:54.948
<i>after seeing Los Angeles and this
here story I'm about to unfold,</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:57.868
<i>well, I guess
I've seen something</i>

01:57.951 --> 02:02.122
<i>every bit as stupefying as you can
see in any of those other places,</i>

02:02.205 --> 02:04.374
<i>and in English, too.</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:07.377
<i>So I can die with
a smile on my face</i>

02:07.461 --> 02:10.255
<i>without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.</i>

02:11.256 --> 02:13.300
<i>Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:16.386
<i>took place back
in the early '90s,</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:21.308
<i>just about the time of our conflict
with Saddam and the Iraqis.</i>

02:21.391 --> 02:24.978
<i>I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's</i> a man...

02:25.062 --> 02:27.105
<i>I won't say a hero.</i>

02:27.189 --> 02:29.232
<i>'Cause what's a hero?</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:31.652
<i>But sometimes there's</i> a man...

02:31.735 --> 02:34.738
<i>And I'm talking about
the Dude here.</i>

02:34.821 --> 02:37.491
<i>Sometimes there's</i> a man...

02:37.574 --> 02:42.162
<i>Well, he's the man
for his time and place.</i>

02:42.245 --> 02:44.998
<i>He fits right in there.</i>

02:45.082 --> 02:48.460
<i>And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:52.172
<i>And even if he is a lazy man,</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:54.883
<i>and the Dude was
most certainly that,</i>

02:54.966 --> 02:58.720
<i>quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,</i>

02:58.804 --> 03:02.683
<i>which would place him high in the
running for laziest worldwide.</i>

03:03.934 --> 03:06.728
<i>But sometimes there's</i> a man...

03:06.812 --> 03:09.606
<i>Sometimes there's</i> a man...

03:11.066 --> 03:14.486
<i>Well, I lost my train
of thought here.</i>

03:14.569 --> 03:15.821
But...

03:16.571 --> 03:19.157
<i>Hell, I done introduced him
enough.</i>

03:19.241 --> 03:21.576
<i>...with them all
for a collective action.</i>

03:21.660 --> 03:23.370
<i>This will not stand.</i>

03:23.453 --> 03:26.957
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against Kuwait.</i>

03:27.541 --> 03:33.338
<i>Here on the range I belong</i>

03:33.422 --> 03:35.674
<i>Drifting along</i>

03:35.757 --> 03:38.885
<i>With the tumbling</i>

03:38.969 --> 03:44.391
<i>Tumbleweeds</i>

03:57.654 --> 03:59.948
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.242
I want that money,
Lebowski.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.786
Bunny says you're
good for it.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.581
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.041
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.669
Where's the fucking money,
shithead?

04:15.297 --> 04:17.882
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.552
Don't fuck with us.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.806
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

04:24.890 --> 04:27.768
that means you owe money
to Jackie Treehorn.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.061
Ever thus to deadbeats,
Lebowski.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.731
No, don't do...

04:34.524 --> 04:37.152
- Not on the rug, man.
- See?

04:37.235 --> 04:40.572
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

04:40.655 --> 04:43.617
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong guy.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.452
I'm the Dude, man.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.288
Your name's Lebowski,
Lebowski.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.165
Your wife is Bunny.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.418
My wife? Bunny?

04:53.502 --> 04:55.462
Do you see a wedding ring
on my finger?

04:55.545 --> 04:57.839
Does this place look like
I'm fucking married?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.091
The toilet seat's up, man!

05:08.391 --> 05:10.018
What the fuck is this?

05:10.101 --> 05:12.312
Obviously you're
not a golfer.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.025
Woo?
Yeah.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.778
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.364
Fuck.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.575
Yeah. What do you think?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.953
He looks like
a fucking loser.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.789
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.582
Fucking time-waster.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.543
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.427
<i>La-Ia-Ia, Ia-Ia-Ia, Ia-Ia-la</i>

05:44.928 --> 05:47.848
<i>La-Ia-Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia</i>

05:47.931 --> 05:51.309
<i>La-Ia-Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia-Ia Ia-Ia</i>

05:51.726 --> 05:53.478
<i>La, Ia, Ia-Ia</i>

06:00.735 --> 06:02.112
La-Ia, Ia-Ia

06:04.948 --> 06:07.158
<i>The man in me will do</i>

06:08.285 --> 06:10.537
<i>Nearly any task</i>

06:11.663 --> 06:14.875
<i>And as for compensation</i>

06:14.958 --> 06:17.460
<i>There's little he would ask</i>

06:18.253 --> 06:20.839
<i>Take a woman like you</i>

06:21.548 --> 06:23.133
<i>To get through</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:25.719
<i>To the man in me</i>

06:28.889 --> 06:32.350
<i>Storm clouds are raging</i>

06:32.434 --> 06:35.353
<i>All around my door</i>

06:36.146 --> 06:37.898
<i>I think to myself</i>

06:37.981 --> 06:41.484
<i>I might not take it anymore</i>

06:42.235 --> 06:45.196
<i>Take a woman like your kind</i>

06:45.655 --> 06:49.492
<i>To find the man in me</i>

06:52.329 --> 06:54.915
<i>But, oh</i>

06:54.998 --> 06:57.459
<i>What a wonderful feeling</i>

06:59.878 --> 07:03.673
<i>Just to know that you are near</i>

07:06.509 --> 07:10.472
<i>Sets my heart a-reeling</i>

07:12.015 --> 07:14.976
<i>From my toes</i>

07:15.268 --> 07:19.272
<i>Up to my ears</i>

07:19.356 --> 07:22.567
<i>The man in me will
hide sometimes</i>

07:22.651 --> 07:25.278
<i>To keep from being seen</i>

07:25.946 --> 07:29.240
<i>But that's just because
he doesn't want</i>

07:29.324 --> 07:32.243
<i>To turn into some machine</i>

07:32.327 --> 07:34.746
<i>Take a woman like you</i>

07:35.497 --> 07:37.332
<i>To get through</i>

07:37.415 --> 07:39.292
<i>To the man in me</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:46.758
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

07:46.841 --> 07:51.346
I'm telling you, this
was a valued rug. This was a...

07:51.429 --> 07:53.974
Yeah, man. It really
tied the room together.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.684
This was
a valued...

07:55.725 --> 07:57.519
What tied the room together, Dude?
My rug.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.104
Were you listening to the
Dude's story, Donny?

07:59.187 --> 08:00.271
What?
Walter.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.066
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
I was bowling.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.402
So you have no frame of
reference here, Donny.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.279
You're like a child who wanders into the
middle of a movie and wants to know...

08:08.405 --> 08:11.825
Walter, what's the point, man? There's
no reason, here's my point, Dude.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.535
There's no fucking reason
why these two...

08:13.618 --> 08:14.786
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.871
Walter, what is the...

08:16.955 --> 08:19.374
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.668
What the fuck are you
talking about? Huh?

08:21.751 --> 08:24.462
No, what the fuck
are you... I'm not...

08:25.088 --> 08:27.340
We're talking about unchecked
aggression here, Dude.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.092
What the fuck is he talking about?
My rug.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.969
Forget it, Donny! You're
out of your element!

08:31.052 --> 08:33.638
Walter, the Chinaman
who peed on my rug,

08:33.722 --> 08:35.557
I can't go
give him a bill!

08:35.640 --> 08:37.308
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

08:37.392 --> 08:38.518
What the fuck are
you talking about?

08:38.601 --> 08:40.729
The Chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude!

08:40.812 --> 08:43.398
I'm talking about drawing
a line in the sand, Dude.

08:43.481 --> 08:45.900
Across this line
you do not...

08:45.984 --> 08:50.071
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not
the preferred nomenclature.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.781
Asian-American,
please.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.285
Walter, this isn't a guy who built
the railroads here. This is a guy...

08:55.368 --> 08:56.995
What the fuck
are you...

08:57.120 --> 09:00.123
Walter, he peed on my rug!
He peed on the Dude's rug.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.750
Donny, you're out
of your element.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.128
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.630
So, who...
Jeff Lebowski.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.842
The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.678
That's fucking interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

09:13.762 --> 09:17.724
Plus, he has the wealth,
obviously, and the resources,

09:17.807 --> 09:20.351
so that there's no reason,
there's no fucking reason

09:20.435 --> 09:23.146
why his wife should go out
and owe money all over town,

09:23.229 --> 09:25.690
and then they come and they
pee on your fucking rug!

09:25.774 --> 09:27.025
Am I wrong?
No.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.651
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but...

09:28.735 --> 09:29.778
Okay then.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.616
That rug really tied the
room together, did it not?

09:34.699 --> 09:36.618
Fucking A.
And this guy peed on it.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.036
Donny, please.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.287
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

09:39.370 --> 09:41.664
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.084
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

09:44.167 --> 09:48.463
This is the guy who should
compensate me for the fucking rug.

09:48.546 --> 09:52.175
His wife goes out and owes money all
over town, and they pee on my rug?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.302
They pee on
your fucking rug?

09:54.385 --> 09:57.097
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.850
They peed on
your fucking rug.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.145
This is the study.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.815
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

10:06.940 --> 10:10.819
"Jeffrey Lebowski." ...citations,
honorary degrees, et cetera.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.572
Very impressive. Oh, please
feel free to inspect them.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.283
Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.285
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

10:19.369 --> 10:24.749
which Mr. Lebowski received two years ago
in recognition of his various civic...

10:24.833 --> 10:29.504
Oh! That's the Los Angeles Chamber
of Commerce Business Achiever Award,

10:29.587 --> 10:31.756
which is given... Oh, not
necessarily given every year.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.924
Hey, is this...

10:33.049 --> 10:34.259
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

10:34.342 --> 10:35.635
ls this him with Nancy?

10:35.718 --> 10:38.972
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.265
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

10:40.348 --> 10:42.976
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

10:43.059 --> 10:45.812
Of course. Mr. Lebowski, on the left...
So he's a...

10:45.895 --> 10:48.481
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

10:48.565 --> 10:50.733
Mr. Lebowski is
disabled, yes.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.571
This picture was taken when Mrs.
Reagan was first lady of the nation.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.738
Yes, yes.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.782
Not of California.
Good shot.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.076
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.912
though, unfortunately, there wasn't
enough time for a photo opportunity.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.956
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
Oh, wonderful woman.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.333
We were very happy to...
These are...

11:07.417 --> 11:10.086
Oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.421
Different mothers, huh?

11:11.546 --> 11:13.840
No, they're not... Racially,
he's pretty cool?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.385
They're not literally
his children.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.721
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

11:19.804 --> 11:22.849
inner city children of promise, but
without the necessary means for...

11:22.932 --> 11:24.934
Necessary means for
a higher education,

11:25.018 --> 11:28.438
so Mr. Lebowski is committed to
sending all of them to college.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.856
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.691
Thank you. Thank you.

11:31.816 --> 11:36.279
Far out. Think he's got room
for one more? One... Oh.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.157
You never went to college.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.326
Please, don't touch that. Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I did,

11:41.409 --> 11:43.703
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

11:43.786 --> 11:46.915
occupying various
administration buildings,

11:46.998 --> 11:48.708
smoking a lot
of Thai stick,

11:48.875 --> 11:52.045
breaking into
the ROTC and bowling.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.380
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.348
Okay, sir. You're a
Lebowski, I'm a Lebowski.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.183
That's terrific.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.144
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.897
What can I do for you, sir?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.525
Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.611
It really tied
the room together.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.405
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.990
Where do I fit in?

12:21.658 --> 12:24.911
Well, they were looking
for you, these two guys.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.955
You know, they...
I'll say it again.

12:27.038 --> 12:30.166
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.293
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.588
Oh, so you know that they were
trying to piss on your rug.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.882
Did I urinate on your rug?

12:37.966 --> 12:40.218
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.262
Hello! Do you speak
English, sir?

12:42.345 --> 12:44.222
<i>G, Parla usted inglÃ©s?</i>

12:44.305 --> 12:47.183
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

12:48.017 --> 12:50.603
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.355
I just want to
understand this, sir.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.359
Every time a rug is micturated
upon in this fair city,

12:56.442 --> 12:58.194
I have to compensate
the person?

12:58.278 --> 13:01.489
Come on, man. I'm not trying
to scam anybody here.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.408
You know, I'm just...

13:03.491 --> 13:07.036
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

13:08.371 --> 13:10.665
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

13:11.165 --> 13:14.085
Wait. Let me explain
something to you.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.004
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.048
You're Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.634
So that's what you call me.
You know?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.803
That or His Dudeness,

13:23.886 --> 13:26.347
or Duder or, you know,

13:26.431 --> 13:29.475
El Duderino, if you're not
into the whole brevity thing.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.561
Are you employed, sir?

13:32.937 --> 13:34.230
Employed?

13:35.398 --> 13:40.153
You don't go out looking for a job
dressed like that, do you? On a weekday?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.612
Is this a...

13:41.696 --> 13:44.824
What day is this?
Well, I do work, sir.

13:44.907 --> 13:49.078
So, if you don't mind... No, I do mind.
The Dude minds.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.913
This will not stand, you know.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.499
This aggression
will not stand, man.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.335
I mean,
your wife owes money...

13:55.418 --> 13:58.379
My wife is not
the issue here!

13:58.463 --> 14:01.841
I hope that someday my wife will
learn to live on her allowance,

14:01.924 --> 14:03.343
which is ample.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.262
But if she does not, that
is her problem, not mine,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.972
just as the rug
is your problem.

14:08.056 --> 14:12.018
Just as every bum's lot in life
is his own responsibility,

14:12.101 --> 14:14.812
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.982
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.526
Some Chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.029
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

14:24.322 --> 14:27.492
I cannot solve your problems, sir.
Only you can.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.038
Well, fuck it.
Oh, fuck it.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.208
Yes, that's your answer. That's
your answer to everything.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.043
Tattoo it on your forehead!

14:37.126 --> 14:39.587
Your revolution is over,
Mr. Lebowski!

14:39.670 --> 14:42.924
Condolences! The bums lost!

14:43.007 --> 14:46.219
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

14:46.302 --> 14:48.096
Get a job, sir!

14:48.179 --> 14:50.723
The bums will
always lose!

14:50.807 --> 14:52.558
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?

14:52.642 --> 14:55.061
The bums will
always lose.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.606
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.191
OkayÂ»

15:00.274 --> 15:02.777
The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.113
Well, enjoy.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.740
And perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

15:07.824 --> 15:08.950
Yeah, sure.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.911
If I'm in the neighborhood,
you know,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.581
and I need to use the john.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.386
Blow on them.
Huh?

15:28.845 --> 15:30.721
Go ahead. Blow.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.852
You want me to blow
on your toes?

15:36.352 --> 15:37.520
Uh-huh.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.022
I can't blow that far.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.281
Are you sure he won't mind?

15:48.364 --> 15:51.451
Uli doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.786
Oh, that must be exhausting.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.621
You're not blowing.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.458
Our guest has to be getting along, Mrs.
Lebowski.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.959
Oh!

16:00.460 --> 16:01.919
You're Bunny.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.381
I'll suck your cock
for $1,000.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.721
Wonderful woman.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.931
We're all very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.726
Brandt can't watch though,
or he has to pay $100.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.896
That's marvelous.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.901
I'm just gonna go
find a cash machine.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.574
I'm slamming them tonight!

16:32.200 --> 16:33.951
You guys are dead
in the water.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.996
All right!
Way to go, Donny!

16:38.039 --> 16:40.416
"lf you
will it, it is no dream."

16:40.500 --> 16:43.920
Fucking 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
Theodore Herzl.
Huh?

16:46.088 --> 16:49.175
State of Israel. If you will
it, Dude, it is no dream.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.135
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

16:51.260 --> 16:54.096
The carrier. What's in the
fucking carrier? Huh?

16:54.222 --> 16:57.141
Oh! Cynthia's dog.
Think it's a Pomeranian.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.227
Can't leave him home alone
or he eats the furniture.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.063
I'm watching it while Cynthia and
Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.065
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

17:04.147 --> 17:05.691
What do you mean,
brought it bowling?

17:05.775 --> 17:08.778
I didn't rent it shoes. I'm
not buying it a fucking beer.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.946
He's not taking your
fucking turn, Dude.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.367
Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
me to take care of her fucking dog

17:14.450 --> 17:16.202
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

17:16.285 --> 17:18.871
I'd tell her to go fuck herself.
Why can't she board it?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.790
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

17:20.873 --> 17:24.042
Secondly, this is a fucking
show dog with fucking papers.

17:24.126 --> 17:26.837
You can't board it. It gets upset.
Its hair falls out.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.257
Walter... Fucking dog
has fucking papers.

17:29.340 --> 17:32.009
Over the line!
Huh?

17:32.093 --> 17:34.428
I'm sorry, Smokey. You were over the line.
That's a foul.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.180
Bullshit. Mark it eight, Dude.

17:36.264 --> 17:39.392
Excuse me. Mark it zero.
Next frame.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.395
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it eight, Dude.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.064
Smokey, this is not Nam. This is bowling.
There are rules.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.900
Hey, Walter, come on.
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.152
So his toe slipped over
a little, you know.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.405
It's just a game, man.
This is a league game.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.407
This determines who enters
the next round robin.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.242
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah, but I wasn't...

17:56.325 --> 17:58.869
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but I wasn't over.

17:58.953 --> 18:01.664
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an eight.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.499
Smokey, my friend,

18:04.333 --> 18:07.295
you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, man.

18:07.378 --> 18:11.090
You mark that frame an eight,
you're entering a world of pain.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.759
I'm not...
A world of pain.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.928
Look,Dude,
this is your partner.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.389
Has the whole world
gone crazy?

18:18.472 --> 18:21.225
Am I the only one around here who
gives a shit about the rules?

18:21.350 --> 18:22.560
Mark it zero!

18:22.643 --> 18:24.729
They're calling the
cops, man. Put the piece away.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.898
Mark it zero! DUDE: Walter,
put the piece away.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.192
Walter. You think I'm
fucking around here?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.902
Mark it zero!

18:38.701 --> 18:40.953
All right. It's fucking zero.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.122
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.501
It's a league game,
Smokey.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.880
You can't do that, man.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.674
These guys, you know, they're
like me, they're pacifists.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.344
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.263
You know, Dude, I myself dabbled
in pacifism at one point.

18:59.347 --> 19:00.640
Not in Nam, of course.

19:00.723 --> 19:04.185
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.687
You mean, beyond pacifism?

19:06.771 --> 19:09.482
He's fragile.
He's very fragile.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.070
I did not know that.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.031
Well, it's all water
under the bridge.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.117
And we do enter
the next round robin.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.495
Am I wrong?
No, you're not wrong.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.330
Am I wrong?
You're not wrong, Walter.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.790
You're just an asshole.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.333
Okay then.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.043
Play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.045
They should be pushovers.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.674
Man, would you just...

19:34.757 --> 19:36.509
Just take it easy, man.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.886
You know, that's your answer
for everything, Dude.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.847
Let me point out something.
Pacifism is not...

19:41.931 --> 19:44.767
Look at our current situation
with that camel fucker in Iraq.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.811
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.271
Just take it easy, man.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.732
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

19:51.816 --> 19:55.277
Yeah, waving the fucking gun around?
Calmer than you are.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.279
Will you just take it easy?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.907
Calmer than you are.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.871
<i>Dude, this is Smokey.</i>

20:05.955 --> 20:07.873
<i>Look, I don't wanna be
a hard-on about this,</i>

20:07.957 --> 20:09.208
<i>and I know
it wasn't your fault,</i>

20:09.291 --> 20:10.876
<i>but I just thought
it was fair to tell you</i>

20:10.960 --> 20:13.170
<i>that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league</i>

20:13.254 --> 20:15.464
<i>and asking them
to set aside the round.</i>

20:15.548 --> 20:18.217
<i>I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.</i>

20:18.300 --> 20:21.554
<i>So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.</i>

20:21.637 --> 20:23.097
<i>Tell Walter.</i>

20:23.180 --> 20:24.432
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

20:26.308 --> 20:28.644
<i>Mr. Lebowski,
this is Brandt</i> at...

20:30.312 --> 20:32.189
<i>Well, at Mr. Leb0wski's
office.</i>

20:32.273 --> 20:34.775
<i>Please call us
as soon as it's convenient.</i>

20:36.527 --> 20:38.571
<i>Mr. Lebowski,
this is Mel Zelnicker</i>

20:38.654 --> 20:40.114
<i>of the Southern Cal
Bowling League.</i>

20:40.197 --> 20:45.453
<i>I just got an informal report that a
member of your team, a Walter Sobchak,</i>

20:45.536 --> 20:47.788
<i>drew a firearm
during league play.</i>

20:47.913 --> 20:49.457
<i>If this is true, of course,</i>

20:49.540 --> 20:51.250
<i>it contravenes</i> a <i>number of
the league's bylaws</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:53.043
<i>and also article 27
of the</i> league...

20:54.503 --> 20:56.797
Dude.
Hey, Marty.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.632
Dude, I finally got...

20:58.716 --> 21:01.010
I got the venue I wanted.

21:01.552 --> 21:05.014
I'm performing my dance
quintet, you know, my cycle,

21:05.097 --> 21:07.850
at Crane Jackson's Fountain
Street Theater on Tuesday night.

21:07.933 --> 21:12.188
And, well, I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.732
I'll be there, man.

21:17.026 --> 21:19.904
Dude, tomorrow's
already the tenth.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.531
Far out.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.328
Oh. Oh, all right. Okay.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.206
Just slip the rent
under my door.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.420
<i>...serious
infraction and examine your standing.</i>

21:36.504 --> 21:38.005
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:39.590 --> 21:42.218
<i>Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.</i>

21:42.301 --> 21:45.721
<i>Please do call us as soon as you
get in and I'll send the limo.</i>

21:45.805 --> 21:49.391
<i>I hope you're not avoiding
this call because of the rug,</i>

21:49.475 --> 21:52.144
<i>which I assure you
is not a problem.</i>

21:52.228 --> 21:54.855
<i>We need your help,</i> and...

21:54.939 --> 21:58.901
<i>Well, we would very much like to see you.
Thank you. It's Brandt.</i>

22:00.236 --> 22:01.695
We've had some
terrible news.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.989
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.954
Mr. Lebowski.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.212
Funny.

22:19.421 --> 22:23.217
I can look back on
a life of achievement,

22:23.300 --> 22:25.511
challenges met,

22:25.594 --> 22:27.638
competitors bested,

22:27.721 --> 22:29.431
obstacles overcome.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.395
I've accomplished
more than most men

22:34.478 --> 22:36.772
and without
the use of my legs.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.238
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

22:45.531 --> 22:46.949
Dude.
Huh?

22:48.993 --> 22:51.662
Oh, I don't know, sir.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.623
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing,

22:56.750 --> 22:58.419
whatever the cost?

22:59.253 --> 23:01.380
Isn't that what
makes a man?

23:02.506 --> 23:05.009
Sure, that and
a pair of testicles.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.386
You're joking,

23:09.638 --> 23:11.265
but perhaps you're right.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.267
You mind if I do a Jay?

23:15.185 --> 23:16.353
Bunny.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.773
Excuse me?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.650
Bunny Lebowski.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.904
She is the light of my life.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.991
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

23:30.910 --> 23:32.786
Oh, fucking A.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.372
Strong men also cry.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.002
Strong men also cry.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.507
I received
this fax this morning.

23:48.469 --> 23:52.097
As you can see,
it is a ransom note.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.100
<i>"We have Bunny."</i>

23:55.184 --> 23:59.438
Written by men who were unable to
achieve on a level field of play.

23:59.521 --> 24:02.149
<i>"Gather $1 million..."</i>

24:02.274 --> 24:05.653
<i>Cowards! - - In unmarked,
nonconsecutive 20s-"</i>

24:05.736 --> 24:08.447
<i>VVeakHngs!
"A wait instructions."</i>

24:08.572 --> 24:10.324
<i>Bums!
"No funny stuff."</i>

24:11.408 --> 24:13.577
Bummer.
Huh?

24:14.828 --> 24:18.540
This is a bummer, man.
That's... That's a bummer.

24:19.333 --> 24:22.044
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

24:36.600 --> 24:41.355
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as courier

24:41.438 --> 24:43.983
once we get instructions
for the money.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.234
Why me, man?

24:45.317 --> 24:50.823
He believes the culprits might be
the very people who soiled your rug

24:50.906 --> 24:55.828
and you are in a unique position to
confirm or disconfirm that suspicion.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.663
He thinks the carpet pissers
did this?

24:57.746 --> 24:59.665
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.009
<i>Welcome to the
Hotel California</i>

26:34.885 --> 26:36.804
<i>Such a lovely place</i>

26:36.887 --> 26:38.764
Fucking Quintana.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.059
That creep can roll, man.

26:42.184 --> 26:45.187
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.
Yeah.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.066
No, he's a sex offender
with a record.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.111
He did six months in Chino for
exposing himself to an eight-year-old.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.489
<i>When he moved to Hollywood,
he had to go door-to-door</i>

26:55.572 --> 26:57.366
<i>to tell everyone
he was a pederast.</i>

26:58.325 --> 27:01.829
<i>What's a pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.</i>

27:04.164 --> 27:06.750
So, how much
did he give you?

27:06.834 --> 27:10.087
20 grand, man. And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.547
Just for making a hand-off?
Yeah.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.007
They gave Dude a beeper.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.803
So whenever these guys call...
What if it's during a game?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.514
Oh, I told them if it was
during league play...

27:20.597 --> 27:21.723
What's during
league play?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.268
Life does not stop and
start at your convenience,

27:24.351 --> 27:26.270
you miserable
piece of shit.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.313
Ifigure... What's wrong
with Walter, Dude?

27:28.397 --> 27:30.899
I figure it's easy money, you know.
It's all pretty harmless.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.818
She probably
kidnapped herself.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.655
What do you mean, Dude?
Rug-peers did not do this.

27:36.738 --> 27:41.618
Look at it. A young trophy wife
marries this guy for his money.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.538
She figures he isn't giving
her enough, you know.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.373
She owes money
all over town.

27:46.456 --> 27:48.625
That fucking bitch!

27:48.709 --> 27:50.502
It's all a goddamn
fake, man.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.504
It's like Lenin said,

27:52.588 --> 27:57.551
you look for the person who
will benefit and, you know...

27:57.634 --> 28:00.262
<i>I Am</i> the Walrus?
You know, you'll...

28:00.929 --> 28:02.931
You know what I'm trying to say.
<i>I Am</i> the VVa/rus.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.809
That fucking bitch!
Oh, yeah!

28:05.893 --> 28:07.311
<i>I Am the Walrus.
Thafis...</i>

28:07.394 --> 28:08.896
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

28:08.979 --> 28:12.024
V.l. Lenin, Vladimir
llyich Ulyanov!

28:12.107 --> 28:13.275
What the fuck is
he talking about?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.194
Fucking exactly what
happened to those...

28:15.277 --> 28:16.820
That makes me
fucking sick!

28:16.945 --> 28:19.865
Well, what do you care, Walter?
Those rich fucks.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.909
This whole fucking thing.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.745
I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck

28:24.828 --> 28:26.580
so that this
fucking strumpet,

28:26.663 --> 28:27.831
this fucking whore,
could waltz around...

28:27.915 --> 28:30.334
I don't see any connection
with Vietnam, man.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.044
Well, there isn't a
literal connection, Dude.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.046
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.589
Your roll.
Have it your way.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.007
Your roll.
But my point is...

28:37.132 --> 28:39.885
My point is... QUINTANA: Are
you ready to be fucked, man?

28:41.553 --> 28:44.348
I see you rolled your way
into the semis.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.726
<i>Dios mio, man.</i>

28:47.809 --> 28:50.646
Liam and me,
we're gonna fuck you up.

28:51.146 --> 28:56.944
Yeah? Well, you know, that's
just like your opinion, man.

28:58.153 --> 29:01.240
Let me tell you
something, pendejo.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.533
You pull any of your
crazy shit with us,

29:03.617 --> 29:06.411
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

29:06.495 --> 29:09.414
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

29:09.498 --> 29:12.709
and pull the fucking trigger
till it goes click.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.921
Jesus.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.673
You said it, man.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.008
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.683
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

29:50.872 --> 29:54.042
<i>La-Ia-Ia, Ia-Ia-Ia, Ia-Ia-la</i>

29:54.418 --> 29:56.545

30:21.069 --> 30:24.156

30:24.239 --> 30:26.325
<i>There's little he would ask</i>

30:27.909 --> 30:30.495
<i>Take a woman like you</i>

30:31.288 --> 30:32.706
<i>To get through</i>

30:33.165 --> 30:35.250
<i>To the man in me</i>

30:38.295 --> 30:41.423
<i>Storm clouds are raging</i>

30:41.923 --> 30:44.468
<i>All around my door</i>

30:45.552 --> 30:47.429
<i>I think to myself</i>

30:47.512 --> 30:50.974
<i>I might not take it anymore</i>

30:51.767 --> 30:54.686
<i>Take a woman like your kind</i>

30:55.103 --> 30:59.149
<i>To find the man in me</i>

31:01.902 --> 31:03.612
<i>But, oh</i>

31:04.863 --> 31:06.782
<i>What a wonderful feeling</i>

31:09.409 --> 31:11.203
<i>Just to know</i>

31:11.286 --> 31:13.747
<i>That you are near</i>

31:16.708 --> 31:20.128
<i>Sets my heart a-reeling</i>

31:21.505 --> 31:24.383
<i>From my toes</i>

31:24.925 --> 31:27.969
<i>Up to my ears</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:32.099
<i>The man in me
will hide sometimes</i>

31:32.182 --> 31:33.683
They called
about 80 minutes ago.

31:33.767 --> 31:36.395
They want you to take the
money, drive north on the 405.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.813
They will call you
on the portable phone

31:37.896 --> 31:39.981
with instructions
in about 40 minutes.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.149
One person only.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.652
They were very clear on that, or
I'd go with you. One person only.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.780
Vvhathappened to your jaw?
Oh, nothing, man.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.950
Here's the money.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.411
And the phone.

31:52.494 --> 31:55.330
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.208
All right.
Her life is in your hands.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.918
Man, don't say that.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.587
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat
that, her life is in your hands.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.005
Oh, shit, man.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.425
Her life is in
yourhands,Dude.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.177
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

32:18.687 --> 32:22.941
Where the fuck are you going, man?
Take the ringer, I'll drive.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.235
The what?
The ringer.

32:25.318 --> 32:26.945
The ringer, Dude.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.663
What the...
Have they called yet?

32:36.746 --> 32:38.540
What the hell is this?

32:38.623 --> 32:41.501
My dirty undies, Dude.
The laundry. The whites.

32:41.585 --> 32:45.714
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies, man.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.090
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

32:47.174 --> 32:48.467
The ringer cannot look empty.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.635
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

32:50.719 --> 32:52.637
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.557
I got to thinking, why should we settle
for a measly fucking 20 grand...

32:55.640 --> 32:58.852
We? What the fuck, "we"? You said
you just wanted to come along.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.313
My point, Dude, is why should
we settle for 20 grand

33:01.396 --> 33:04.065
when we can keep the entire million?
Am I wrong?

33:04.149 --> 33:07.235
Yes, you're wrong. This
isn't a fucking game, man.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.654
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.948
She kidnapped herself.
I said I thought...

33:18.205 --> 33:20.248
<i>Dude, here. MAN: Who is this?</i>

33:21.666 --> 33:24.628
Dude. The bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

33:24.711 --> 33:25.754
<i>Us?</i>

33:27.380 --> 33:28.465
Shit!

33:30.383 --> 33:33.011
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

33:33.094 --> 33:36.848
I'm not handling the money, driving the
car and talking on the phone all by my...

33:36.932 --> 33:38.183
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

33:38.266 --> 33:41.269
Dude, are you fucking this up?
Who <i>is that?</i>

33:42.604 --> 33:45.190
That is the driver.
I told you...

33:46.942 --> 33:48.860
Oh, shit!
What the fuck's going on?

33:48.944 --> 33:50.320
Walter...
What the fuck is going on?

33:50.403 --> 33:54.699
He hung up, man. You fucked it up.
You fucked it up!

33:54.824 --> 33:57.369
<i>Her â€œfie was 'm our hands, man.
Easy, Dude.</i>

33:57.452 --> 34:01.331
We're screwed now. We don't get shit.
They're gonna kill her.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.125
We're fucked, Walter.
Nothing is fucked, Dude.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.711
Come on.
You're being very un-Dude.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.214
They'll call back.
Look, she kidnapped...

34:10.422 --> 34:12.384
You see? Nothing's
fucked here, Dude.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.346
Nothing is fucked. They're a
bunch of fucking amateurs.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.931
Walter, will you just
shut the fuck up?

34:19.014 --> 34:21.393
Don't say peep while
I'm doing business here, man.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.436
Okay, Dude.
Have it your way.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.983
But they're amateurs.
Fuck.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.735
Dude.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.072
<i>Okay, we proceed but only
if there is no funny stuff.</i>

34:34.155 --> 34:35.699
Yeah, yeah.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.867
<i>So no funny stuff. Okay?</i>

34:37.951 --> 34:40.536
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

34:44.165 --> 34:46.376
That was the sign, man.

34:46.458 --> 34:50.170
So, all we gotta do
is get her back.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.632
No one's in a position
to complain.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.135
We keep the baksheesh.
Yeah, terrific, Walter.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.887
But you haven't told me how we're
gonna get her back. Where is she?

34:57.971 --> 34:59.806
That's the simple part, Dude.

34:59.889 --> 35:04.185
We make the hand-off, I grab one of
them and beat it out of him. Huh?

35:05.312 --> 35:07.939
That's a great plan, Walter.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.150
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.193
It's a Swiss fucking watch.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.405
That's right, Dude. The beauty
of this is its simplicity.

35:15.488 --> 35:18.742
Once a plan gets too complex,
everything can go wrong.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.577
If there's one thing
I learned in Nam...

35:24.539 --> 35:25.624
Dude.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.542
<i>You are coming
to wooden bridge.</i>

35:27.626 --> 35:28.793
<i>When you cross the bridge,</i>

35:28.877 --> 35:32.172
<i>you throw the bag from the
left window of the moving car.</i>

35:32.255 --> 35:33.298
<i>You're being watched.</i>

35:34.633 --> 35:36.968
<i>Fuck. Wham he say'?</i>

35:37.052 --> 35:38.720
There is no fucking
hand-off, man.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.473
At the wooden bridge we throw
the money out of the oar.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.392
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

35:44.934 --> 35:47.604
We can't do that, Dude.
That fucks up our plan.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.606
Well, call them up and
explain it to them, Walter.

35:49.689 --> 35:50.940
Your plan is so
fucking simple,

35:51.024 --> 35:52.817
I'm sure they'll
fucking understand it.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.027
That's the beauty of it.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.529
Wooden bfidge,huh?
Throw them the money, Walter.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.156
We're not fucking around, man.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.492
Okay, Dude, the bridge is coming up.
Give me the ringer, chop-chop.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.118
Fuck that.
Walter, I love you,

36:02.202 --> 36:05.288
but sooner or later you're gonna have to
face the fact you're a goddamn moron.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.707
Okay, Dude. No time to argue.
Hey, man!

36:07.791 --> 36:10.168
Here's the bridge.
Hey, Walter! Hey, Walter!

36:10.251 --> 36:12.962
Hey, Walter!
Here goes the ringer!

36:14.255 --> 36:16.466
What the fuck?
Okay, Dude, you're wheel.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.718
Hey, man, what the fuck?
At 15 mph, I roll out.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.720
I double back, grab one of
them and beat it out of him.

36:20.804 --> 36:22.013
The Uzi.
Uzi.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.182
You didn't think I was rolling
out of here naked, did you?

36:24.265 --> 36:26.893
Walter, please! Fifteen, Dude! This is it!
Let's take that hill!

36:26.976 --> 36:28.269
Walter!

36:51.084 --> 36:53.795
We have it!

36:53.878 --> 36:56.381
We have it!

36:56.464 --> 36:58.425
We have it!

37:12.981 --> 37:14.983
Fuck it, Dude.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.651
Let's go bowling.

37:55.148 --> 37:58.443
Aitz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.320
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

38:00.403 --> 38:03.490
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

38:03.573 --> 38:05.700
Oh, him.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.787
I don't know. Vvhatexacfly
is the problem?

38:08.870 --> 38:10.705
The problem is...

38:11.998 --> 38:13.750
What do you mean,
what's the...

38:13.833 --> 38:15.376
There was no...

38:16.211 --> 38:17.796
We didn't...

38:18.880 --> 38:21.090
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

38:21.174 --> 38:23.009
What the fuck
are you talking about?

38:23.092 --> 38:25.637
The poor woman, that poor
slut kidnapped herself.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.013
Come on, Dude.
You said so yourself.

38:27.096 --> 38:29.390
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

38:29.474 --> 38:30.975
You're the one who's
so fucking certain.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.603
That's right, Dude.
100% certain.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.396
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.731
Donny, shut the fuck...

38:36.815 --> 38:38.817
When do we play?
This Saturday. Quintana and...

38:38.900 --> 38:40.652
Saturday? Well, they'll
have to reschedule.

38:40.735 --> 38:43.071
Walter, what am I
gonna tell Lebowski?

38:43.154 --> 38:46.491
I told that fuck down at the league office.
V\Iho's in charge of scheduling?

38:46.574 --> 38:48.117
Walter!
Burkhalter.

38:48.201 --> 38:51.162
I told that kraut a fucking thousand
times, I don't roll on shabbos!

38:51.246 --> 38:52.539
Walter!
They already posted it.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.207
Well, they can
fucking un-post it!

38:54.290 --> 38:57.585
Who gives a shit? They're gonna
kill that poor woman, man!

38:57.710 --> 38:59.963
What am I gonna tell Lebowski?
Come on, Dude.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.049
Eventually she'll get tired of her little
game and, you know, wander on back.

39:03.132 --> 39:04.676
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

39:04.759 --> 39:05.885
<i>I'm shomer shabbos.</i>

39:06.010 --> 39:07.929
What's that, Walter? Yeah,
and in the meantime,

39:08.012 --> 39:09.430
what do I tell Lebowski?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.850
Saturday, Donny, is <i>shabbos,</i>
the Jewish day of rest.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.394
That means I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

39:14.477 --> 39:15.979
I don't fucking
ride in a car,

39:16.062 --> 39:17.897
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven

39:17.981 --> 39:20.108
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

39:21.025 --> 39:22.110
Sheesh.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.736
<i>Shomer shabbos!</i>

39:25.655 --> 39:28.324
Walter, how am I gonna...
Shomer fucking shabbos!

39:28.449 --> 39:31.703
Oh, fuck! That's it. I'm out of here.
Oh, come on, Dude.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.623
Dude!Dude!

39:37.876 --> 39:39.210
You just tell him...

39:39.294 --> 39:41.671
Tell him we made the drop and
everything went, you know...

39:41.754 --> 39:42.797
Oh, yeah.
How'd it go?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.757
Went all right. Dude's car
got a little dinged up.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.218
Walter, we didn't make
the fucking hand-off, man!

39:47.302 --> 39:49.387
They didn't get
the fucking money!

39:49.470 --> 39:50.680
And they're gonna...
They're gonna...

39:50.763 --> 39:52.348
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.101
They're gonna kill
that poor woman!

39:55.184 --> 39:56.644
Walter, if you can't
ride in a car,

39:56.728 --> 39:58.104
then how do you get
around on shabbos?

39:58.187 --> 40:00.231
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.608
They're not gonna
kill shit.

40:01.691 --> 40:02.817
They're not gonna do shit.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.527
What can they do to her?
Bunch of fucking amateurs.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.446
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.781
Who's sitting on a million
fucking dollars?

40:08.865 --> 40:09.991
Am I wrong?
Walter.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.119
V\Iho's got a fucking million fucking
dollars sitting in the trunk of our oar?

40:13.244 --> 40:16.247
Our car, Walter? And what do they got?
My dirty undies.

40:16.331 --> 40:17.999
My fucking whites!

40:24.088 --> 40:25.423
SaY,Dude?

40:26.299 --> 40:28.217
Where is your car?

40:28.343 --> 40:31.471
Who's got your undies, Walter?
Where's your car, Dude?

40:31.554 --> 40:33.681
You don't know,
Walter?

40:34.390 --> 40:38.061
It was parked in a handicap zone.
Perhaps they towed it.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.689
You fucking
know it's been stolen.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.692
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

40:46.069 --> 40:47.487
Oh, fuck it.

40:50.031 --> 40:53.451
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.

40:53.534 --> 40:56.704
Phone's ringing, Dude.
Thank you, Donny!

41:12.387 --> 41:13.513
Yeah.

41:14.889 --> 41:20.019
Green with some brown,
rust coloration.

41:21.229 --> 41:24.357
And was there anything
of value in the car?

41:24.440 --> 41:25.900
Oh, yeah.

41:27.276 --> 41:31.614
A tape deck, some Creedence
tapes, and there was a...

41:34.200 --> 41:35.743
My briefcase.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.956
In the briefcase?

41:42.083 --> 41:43.251
Papers.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.586
Just papers.

41:46.587 --> 41:49.966
You know, my papers,
business papers.

41:51.634 --> 41:54.971
And what do you do, sir?
I'm unemployed.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.269
My rug was also stolen.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.646
Your rug was in the car?

42:03.730 --> 42:05.440
No. Here.

42:06.107 --> 42:07.775
Separate incidents.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.529
<i>The Dude is not in.</i>

42:11.612 --> 42:14.449
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

42:15.533 --> 42:16.868
Sometimes.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.163
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck though.

42:20.246 --> 42:21.956
Or the Creedence.

42:22.123 --> 42:26.085
What about the briefcase?

42:26.627 --> 42:28.046
<i>Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.</i>

42:28.129 --> 42:30.048
<i>Call when you get home
and I'll send a car for you.</i>

42:30.131 --> 42:33.760
<i>My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.</i>

42:33.843 --> 42:36.929
Well, guess we can close
the file onthatone.

43:28.523 --> 43:31.442
I'll be with you in
a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

43:49.961 --> 43:53.381
Does the female form make you
uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

43:53.464 --> 43:57.260
Is that what this is a picture of?
In a sense, yes.

43:57.343 --> 44:00.012
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

44:00.096 --> 44:01.180
which bothers some men.

44:01.264 --> 44:04.225
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

44:04.725 --> 44:06.811
Vagina.
Oh, yeah?

44:06.894 --> 44:09.313
Yes, they don't like hearing it
and find it difficult to say,

44:09.397 --> 44:10.773
whereas without
batting an eye,

44:10.857 --> 44:15.069
a man will refer to his dick,
or his rod or his johnson.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.321
"Johnson"?

44:17.405 --> 44:20.116
All right, Mr. Lebowski,
let's get down to cases.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.660
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

44:22.743 --> 44:26.706
but as it was a gift from me to my
late mother, it was not his to give.

44:26.789 --> 44:28.708
Now, your face.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.878
As for this kidnapping.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.004
Huh?

44:33.087 --> 44:36.507
Yes, I know all about it, and I
know that you acted as courier.

44:36.591 --> 44:39.844
Let me tell you something. The
whole thing stinks to high heaven.

44:39.927 --> 44:44.140
Yeah, right, but let me explain
something about the rug.

44:44.223 --> 44:46.434
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

44:47.435 --> 44:50.688
Excuse me? Sex, the physical
act of love. Coitus.

44:50.813 --> 44:54.025
Do you like it? I was
talking about my rug.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.652
You're not interested in sex?

44:56.736 --> 44:59.030
You mean coitus?
I like it, too.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.365
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

45:01.449 --> 45:03.868
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.369
However, there are
some people,

45:05.453 --> 45:08.372
it is called satyriasis in
men, nymphomania in women,

45:08.456 --> 45:11.626
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.712
Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

45:14.795 --> 45:18.716
These unfortunate souls cannot love,
in the true sense of the word.

45:18.799 --> 45:22.261
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.555
Listen, Maude,

45:24.639 --> 45:27.850
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

45:27.934 --> 45:31.312
but, you know, I don't see
what this has to do with...

45:31.395 --> 45:34.190
You have any Kahlua?
Take a look at this, sir.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.570
Oh, I know that guy.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.366
He's a nihilist.

45:44.951 --> 45:46.661
"Karl Hungus."

46:00.424 --> 46:01.842
<i>Hi.
Hello.</i>

46:01.926 --> 46:04.887
<i>Mein dispatcher says there is
something wrong with dein Kabel.</i>

46:04.971 --> 46:06.097
<i>Yeah. Come on in.</i>

46:06.180 --> 46:08.599
<i>I'm not really sure exactly what's
really wrong with the cable.</i>

46:08.683 --> 46:11.269
<i>That's why they sent me.
I am an expert.</i>

46:11.352 --> 46:12.687
<i>The TV's in here.</i>

46:12.728 --> 46:15.940
You recognize her, of course.
Helga, bring my tools-

46:18.859 --> 46:20.611
<i>That's my friend Sherry.</i>

46:20.695 --> 46:22.363
<i>She just came over
to use the shower.</i>

46:22.446 --> 46:24.782
The story is ludicrous.

46:24.865 --> 46:27.827
<i>My name is Karl.
lch bin expert.</i>

46:27.910 --> 46:29.954
<i>You must be here
to fix the cable.</i>

46:30.037 --> 46:32.915
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.458
He fixes the cable?

46:34.542 --> 46:36.585
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

46:36.669 --> 46:39.964
Little matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career in pornography,

46:40.047 --> 46:42.675
nor that she has been
banging Jackie Treehorn,

46:42.758 --> 46:44.510
to use the parlance
of our times.

46:44.593 --> 46:48.556
However, I am one of the two
trustees of the Lebowski Foundation,

46:48.639 --> 46:50.308
the other being my father.

46:50.391 --> 46:52.351
The foundation takes
youngsters from Watts and...

46:52.435 --> 46:53.811
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

46:53.894 --> 46:57.606
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes,
and proud we are of all of them.

46:57.690 --> 47:01.527
I asked my father about his withdrawal of
$1 million from the foundation aooount,

47:01.610 --> 47:03.446
and he told me
about this abduction,

47:03.529 --> 47:05.156
but I tell you
it is preposterous.

47:05.239 --> 47:09.160
This compulsive fornicator is taking
my father for the proverbial ride.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.162
Yeah, but my...
I'm getting to your rug.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.997
My father and I
don't get along.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.707
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle and,

47:14.790 --> 47:16.459
needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

47:16.542 --> 47:20.338
However, I hardly wish to make my
father's embezzlement a police matter.

47:20.421 --> 47:23.299
So I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

47:23.382 --> 47:25.509
from the people
you delivered it to.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.512
Well, I could do that.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.473
If you successfully do so,

47:30.556 --> 47:35.811
I will compensate you to the tune
of 10% of the recovered sum.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.897
A hundred...
Thousand. Yes.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.733
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

47:40.816 --> 47:45.071
Yeah, but what about my...
Your rug, yes.

47:45.154 --> 47:47.740
Well, with that money you
can buy any number of rugs

47:47.823 --> 47:50.451
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

47:50.534 --> 47:53.037
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.581
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

47:55.664 --> 47:58.209
Here's the name and number of a
doctor who will look at it for you.

47:58.292 --> 47:59.877
You will receive no bill.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.545
He's a good man
and thorough.

48:01.629 --> 48:03.214
That's thoughtful but...

48:03.297 --> 48:06.801
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

48:08.427 --> 48:10.596
Oh, well, all right.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.265
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

48:13.349 --> 48:15.768
"She's always busting
my frigging agates.

48:15.851 --> 48:19.063
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

48:19.146 --> 48:23.025
"L got a rash so bad on my
ass I can't even sit down.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.236
"But you know me,
I can't complain."

48:25.403 --> 48:27.154
Oh, fucking A, man.

48:27.238 --> 48:29.990
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

48:31.033 --> 48:33.577
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

48:33.661 --> 48:36.789
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

48:36.872 --> 48:38.791
Really down in the dumps.

48:38.874 --> 48:40.251
Lost a little money...

48:40.334 --> 48:43.754
Hey, you know what? Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.089
Yeah, fuck it, man.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.008
You can't be worried about that shit.
Life goes on, man.

48:48.092 --> 48:50.803
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

48:53.514 --> 48:55.808
Hey, yo. Come here.

48:55.891 --> 48:58.394
Who's your friend in
the Volkswagen? Huh?

49:00.271 --> 49:02.481
Yeah.
He followed us here.

49:02.565 --> 49:05.484
When did he start...
Whoa! What the fuck?

49:05.568 --> 49:07.695
Get in the limo, you son of a bitch!
No arguments!

49:07.778 --> 49:10.656
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

49:12.324 --> 49:14.785
Start talking, and talk
fast, you lousy bum.

49:14.869 --> 49:16.704
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

49:16.787 --> 49:19.331
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

49:20.875 --> 49:23.586
Well, we... I don't...

49:23.669 --> 49:25.963
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

49:26.046 --> 49:27.631
They did not
receive the money!

49:27.715 --> 49:30.009
Her life was
in your hands!

49:30.092 --> 49:31.635
This is our concern, Dude.

49:31.719 --> 49:33.762
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

49:33.846 --> 49:35.764
Nothing is fucked?
No, man.

49:35.848 --> 49:39.643
The goddamn plane has
crashed into the mountain!

49:39.727 --> 49:43.981
Man, come on. Who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

49:44.064 --> 49:45.816
We dropped off the damn money.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.193
We?

49:48.486 --> 49:51.489
I, the royal we.

49:51.572 --> 49:52.907
You know. The editorial...

49:52.990 --> 49:55.034
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

49:55.117 --> 49:58.871
Look, man, I've got certain information.
All right?

49:58.954 --> 50:01.457
Certain things have
come to light and...

50:01.540 --> 50:04.168
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

50:04.251 --> 50:09.673
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

50:09.757 --> 50:11.967
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

50:12.051 --> 50:17.890
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

50:17.973 --> 50:22.937
I mean, it's not just... It might not
be just such a simple... You know?

50:23.020 --> 50:26.524
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

50:26.607 --> 50:28.984
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

50:29.068 --> 50:31.028
I've got information, man.

50:31.111 --> 50:32.863
New shit has come to light.

50:32.947 --> 50:34.907
And, shit, man,

50:36.867 --> 50:38.786
she kidnapped herself.

50:41.789 --> 50:44.542
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

50:44.625 --> 50:48.546
A young trophy wife, in the
parlance of our times, you know.

50:48.629 --> 50:53.801
She owes money all over town,
including to known pornographers.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.972
And that's cool.
That's cool.

50:58.847 --> 51:02.685
I'm saying she
needs money, man.

51:02.768 --> 51:06.438
And, you know, of course they're
gonna say they didn't get it

51:07.731 --> 51:10.568
because she wants more, man.

51:10.651 --> 51:13.070
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

51:15.406 --> 51:18.492
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

51:18.576 --> 51:19.660
Sir?

51:21.829 --> 51:25.207
No, Mr. Lebowski, it had
not occurred to me.

51:25.291 --> 51:27.501
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.044
Well, okay, you know?

51:29.128 --> 51:33.632
You guys aren't privy to all
the new shit, so, you know...

51:33.716 --> 51:37.094
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

51:39.513 --> 51:40.639
Speaking of which,

51:40.723 --> 51:45.060
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

51:45.144 --> 51:48.105
My concern is, and I've gotta
check it with my accountant,

51:48.188 --> 51:50.941
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

51:51.025 --> 51:53.611
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

51:54.320 --> 51:58.282
Oh, well, if you've already got
the check made out, that's cool.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.367
We received this
this morning.

52:02.911 --> 52:06.290
Since you have
failed to achieve,

52:06.373 --> 52:09.877
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

52:09.960 --> 52:13.130
since you have
stolen my money,

52:13.213 --> 52:16.925
since you have unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

52:17.009 --> 52:20.971
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

52:21.055 --> 52:23.265
to do whatever is necessary

52:23.349 --> 52:27.478
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

52:28.729 --> 52:32.816
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

52:32.900 --> 52:36.153
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

52:36.236 --> 52:39.865
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.702
By God, sir,

52:44.244 --> 52:47.247
I will not abide another toe.

52:47.873 --> 52:53.253
<i>I hear the cottonwoods
whispering above</i>

52:53.337 --> 52:55.464
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

52:57.216 --> 53:00.219
Whose toe was it, Walter?
How the fuck should I know?

53:00.344 --> 53:03.847
I do know that nothing about it
indicates... The nail polish, Walter.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.224
Fine, Dude.

53:05.307 --> 53:09.186
As if it's impossible to get some nail
polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

53:09.269 --> 53:10.562
Someone else...
Pinking shears.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.022
Where the fuck are
they gonna get...

53:12.106 --> 53:14.858
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

53:14.942 --> 53:16.819
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

53:16.944 --> 53:19.196
You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Yeah, but, Walter...

53:19.279 --> 53:22.700
Hell, I could get you a toe by 3:00
this afternoon with nail polish.

53:22.783 --> 53:24.702
These fucking amateurs.
Walter...

53:24.785 --> 53:27.621
They send us a toe, we're supposed
to shit ourselves with fear.

53:27.705 --> 53:29.248
Jesus Christ!
Walter...

53:29.373 --> 53:31.458
The point is... They're
gonna kill her, Walter,

53:31.542 --> 53:33.210
and then they're
gonna kill me.

53:33.293 --> 53:35.754
Dude, that's...

53:37.047 --> 53:39.216
That's just the
stress talking, man.

53:39.299 --> 53:44.346
Now, so far we have what appears to me
to be a series of victimless crimes.

53:44.430 --> 53:46.974
What about the toe?
Forget about the fucking toe!

53:47.057 --> 53:50.185
Excuse me, sir. Could you
please keep your voices down?

53:50.269 --> 53:52.062
This is a family restaurant.

53:52.146 --> 53:54.565
Oh, please! Dear,
for your information,

53:54.648 --> 53:57.443
the Supreme Court has roundly
rejected prior restraint.

53:57.526 --> 53:59.903
Come on. Walter, this is not a
First Amendment thing, man.

53:59.987 --> 54:03.157
Sir, if you don't calm down, I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

54:03.240 --> 54:06.326
Lady, I got buddies who
died face down in the muck

54:06.410 --> 54:09.079
so that you and I can enjoy
this family restaurant!

54:09.204 --> 54:12.541
All right, I'm out of here.
Hey, Dude, don't go away, man.

54:12.624 --> 54:16.587
Come on. This affects all of us, man!
It's our basic freedoms!

54:21.341 --> 54:22.801
I'm staying.

54:25.012 --> 54:27.014
I'm finishing my coffee.

54:31.852 --> 54:33.645
EnlQYiTIQ my coffee.

54:49.870 --> 54:52.039
<i>The Dude is not in.</i>

54:52.122 --> 54:54.958
<i>Leave a message after the beep.
It takes a minute.</i>

54:56.168 --> 54:59.880
<i>Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty
Officer Rolvaag of the LAPD.</i>

54:59.963 --> 55:01.465
<i>We've recovered
your automobile.</i>

55:01.548 --> 55:04.843
<i>It can be claimed at the North Hollywood
Auto Circus there on Victory.</i>

55:04.927 --> 55:06.053
<i>Their hours there are...</i>

55:06.136 --> 55:07.679
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

55:18.148 --> 55:21.527
Hey! This is a private
residence, man.

55:29.910 --> 55:31.745
Oh, nice marmot.

55:41.505 --> 55:45.592
Where is the money,
Lebowski? V\Ie wants the money, Lebowski!

55:51.598 --> 55:54.810
You think we are kidding or
making with the funny stuff?

55:54.893 --> 55:57.187
We could do things you haven't
dreamed of, Lebowski.

55:57.312 --> 56:01.233
Ja, we believes in nothing. V\Ie
believes in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing!

56:01.316 --> 56:04.653
And tomorrow we come back
and we cut off your johnson.

56:04.736 --> 56:07.990
Excuse me? I said, we
cut off yourjohnson!

56:08.073 --> 56:10.492
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.494
Your Wiggly penis, Lebowski.

56:12.578 --> 56:14.913
Ja. Maybe we stomp on it
and squish it.

56:23.881 --> 56:28.302
It was discovered last night in
Van Nuys lodged against an abutment.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.178
Oh, man. Lodged where?

56:30.262 --> 56:32.556
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

56:32.639 --> 56:35.058
Oh,man! Must've been
a joyride situation.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.686
They abandoned the vehicle once
they hit the retaining wall.

56:37.769 --> 56:41.106
Oh, my fucking briefcase, man!
It's not here! Shit!

56:41.189 --> 56:42.900
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

56:42.983 --> 56:44.985
You gotta get in
on the other side.

56:46.028 --> 56:49.197
The side view was found
on the road by the car.

56:50.782 --> 56:54.703
You're lucky they left the tape
deck though, and the Creedence.

56:55.078 --> 56:57.706
Oh, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

56:57.789 --> 57:00.834
Yeah. It's probably
a vagrant slept in the car.

57:00.918 --> 57:03.670
Or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.005
Hey, man,

57:06.340 --> 57:07.966
are you gonna find these guys?

57:08.050 --> 57:12.596
Or, you know, I mean... You
got any promising leads or...

57:12.888 --> 57:14.431
Leads?

57:14.514 --> 57:16.099
Yeah. Sure.

57:16.183 --> 57:19.436
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

57:19.519 --> 57:23.357
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.067
They got us working in shifts!

57:30.530 --> 57:31.698
Leads!

57:32.532 --> 57:34.952
<i>My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me</i>

57:35.035 --> 57:36.745
<i>before the Germans
can cut my dick off.</i>

57:36.828 --> 57:37.955
Leads!

57:38.038 --> 57:39.706
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

57:39.790 --> 57:41.500
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

57:41.625 --> 57:44.127
Thank you, Walter. Not if I
have anything to say about it.

57:44.211 --> 57:45.253
Thank you, Walter.

57:45.379 --> 57:47.381
That makes me feel very secure.
Dude?

57:47.506 --> 57:50.425
That makes me feel very
warm inside, man. Dude?

57:50.509 --> 57:53.261
This whole fucking thing.

57:53.345 --> 57:56.556
I could be sitting here with
just pee stains on my rug.

57:56.682 --> 57:59.935
But no, man, I got a, you know...
Yeah. Fucking Germans.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.186
Nothing changes.

58:02.229 --> 58:05.816
Fucking Nazis.
They were Nazis, Dude?

58:05.899 --> 58:08.485
Oh, come on, Donny. They
were threatening castration!

58:08.568 --> 58:10.404
Uh-huh. Are we gonna
split hairs here?

58:10.487 --> 58:11.822
No.
Am I wrong?

58:11.905 --> 58:15.200
Well, he didn't... Man,
they were nihilists, man.

58:15.283 --> 58:17.828
They kept saying they
believed in nothing.

58:17.911 --> 58:19.246
Nihilists.

58:20.956 --> 58:22.249
Fuck me.

58:23.959 --> 58:27.129
I mean, say what you want about the
tenets of national socialism, Dude.

58:27.212 --> 58:29.506
At least it's an ethos.
Yeah.

58:29.589 --> 58:32.300
And, also, let's not forget...
Let's not forget, Dude,

58:32.384 --> 58:35.345
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent,

58:35.429 --> 58:38.974
for, you know,
domestic...

58:39.057 --> 58:40.809
Within the city...

58:41.601 --> 58:44.688
That ain't legal, either. What are
you, a fucking park ranger now?

58:44.771 --> 58:46.356
No! I'm just
trying to...

58:46.440 --> 58:49.151
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

58:49.276 --> 58:52.487
<i>
e are sympathmng here, Dude.
Fuck sympathy.</i>

58:52.571 --> 58:56.491
I don't need your fucking sympathy, man.
I need my fucking johnson.

58:57.451 --> 59:00.662
What do you need that for, Dude?
You have got to buck up, man!

59:00.746 --> 59:03.540
You cannot drag this negative
energy into the tournament.

59:03.623 --> 59:06.293
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

59:09.004 --> 59:11.006
Fuck the tournament?

59:11.089 --> 59:14.092
Okay, Dude. I can see you don't
want to be cheered up here.

59:14.176 --> 59:16.636
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

59:21.641 --> 59:24.311
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Right, Dude.

59:26.813 --> 59:30.150
Friends like these, huh, Gary?
That's right, Dude.

59:37.741 --> 59:42.829
<i>See them tumbling down</i>

59:43.789 --> 59:49.002
<i>Pledging their love
to the ground</i>

59:49.669 --> 59:53.924
<i>Lonely, but free,
I'll be found</i>

59:54.049 --> 59:58.386
You got a good sarsaparilla?
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.430
Yeah. That's a good one.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.811
How're you doing there,
Dude?

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.979
Not too good, man.

01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:10.982
One of those days, huh?
Yeah.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:16.947
Well, a wiser fellow
than myself once said,

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.824
"Sometimes you eat
the bear and..."

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.452
Much obliged.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:26.373
"Sometimes the bear,
well, he eats you."

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.794
That some kind of
Eastern thing?

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:32.337
Far from it.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.054
I like your style, Dude.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:46.309
Oh, well, I dig
your style, too, man.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.687
Got a whole cowboy thing
going.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.526
Thank you.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.528
There's just one thing, Dude.

01:00:56.611 --> 01:00:58.363
What's that?

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:01.074
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:06.788
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.542
Okay, Dude. Have it your way.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:15.172
Take her easy, Dude.

01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:16.923
Yeah. Thanks, man.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.639
Call for you, Dude.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:32.063
Hello? <i>MA LJDE: Jeffrey, you
have not gone to the doctor.</i>

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:35.233
Oh, yeah, no.
No, I haven't yet.

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.819
<i>I'd like to see you
immediately.</i>

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:39.779
Oh?

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:55.754
So, you're Lebowski.
Yeah.

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.759
Maude has told me
all about you.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.303
She'll be back in a minute.
Sit down.

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.723
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, sure. White Russian.

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.476
The bar's over there.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:18.401
So, what do you do, Lebowski?
Who the fuck are you, man?

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:23.740
Just a friend of Maudie's. Yeah?
The friend with the cleft asshole?

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.454
What do you do?
Oh, nothing much.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.582
Hello, Jeffrey.
Hello.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.543
Yeah. How are you?
Listen, Maude.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:37.837
I got to

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.467
tender my resignation
or whatever

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:47.555
because looks like your mother
really was kidnapped after all.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:49.683
She most certainly was not.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:54.813
Hey, man, why don't you
fucking listen occasionally?

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.440
You might learn something.
Now, I got...

01:02:57.607 --> 01:03:00.360
Please
don't call her my mother.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.280
She's most definitely the
perpetrator and not the victim.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:06.199
I'm telling you, I've got
pretty definitive evidence.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:09.119
From who?
From the main guy, Uli.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:12.539
Uli Kunkel? Her costar
in the beaver picture?

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:17.294
You mean vagina?
I mean, you know the guy?

01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:20.213
I might have introduced them,
for all I know.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.465
Do you remember Uli?

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:25.302
He's a musician. Used to
have a group, Autobahn.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:29.931
Look in my LP's. They released
one album in the late '70s.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.934
Their music is
sort of a techno pop.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.479
So he's pretending to be the abductor?
V\Iell, yeah.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:39.941
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap
someone you're acquainted with.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:44.529
The whole idea is that the hostage can't
identify you after you've let them go.

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:46.323
Well, I know that.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.163
What the fuck is with this guy?
Who is he?

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:56.750
Knox Harrington,
the video artist.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.752
So, Uli has the money.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:03.506
Well, no, not exactly.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.134
This is a very complicated
case, Maude.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.261
You know, a
lot of ins, a lot of outs,

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:09.512
a lot of what-have-yous

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:12.182
and a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:14.726
You know, a lot of strands
in the old Duder's head.

01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:16.019
Hello?

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.979
If Uli doesn't have it,
then who does?

01:04:18.063 --> 01:04:19.981
It's Sandra
about the Biennale.

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:23.568
Look. I have to take this. Do you
still have that doctor's number?

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:27.197
No, really, it's not even bruised anymore.
Oh, please, Jeffrey.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.367
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed aftereffects.

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:34.537
Aftereffects?

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:07.278
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr. Lebowski, please?

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.446
Mmm?

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.740
No, no, man.
She hit me right here.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:14.494
I understand. Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.924
<i>Just got home from Illinois</i>

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:30.176

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.472

He lives in North Hollywood on
Radford, near the ln-N-Out Burger.

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:52.860
No, the ln-N-Out
Burger's on Camrose.

01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:55.363
Near the ln-N-Out Burger. Those
are good burgers, Walter.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:58.324
Shut the fuck up, Donny. The kid
is in the ninth grade, Dude.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:01.035
And his father is...
Are you ready for this?

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:04.455
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.124
Who the fuck is that?

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:09.252
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
VVhO the...

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.713
Have you ever heard of a little
show called Branded, Dude?

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:12.839
Yes, yes, I...

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.924
"All but one man died
there at Bitter Creek."

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:17.260
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:21.389
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:23.182
The bulk of the series.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.309
Oh.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.935
Not exactly a lightweight. No.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.354
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.568
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you.

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.319
We'll brace the kid.
Should be a pushover.

01:08:35.403 --> 01:08:36.613
We'll be near
the ln-N-Out Burger.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:37.822
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:43.328
V\Ie'll go out there, we'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:45.537
We'll get that fucking
million dollars back,

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.749
if he hasn't
spent it already.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.876
A million fucking clams.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:53.630
And, yes, we'll be near the...
ln-N-Out.

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:57.466
Shh! Shh! Some burgers, some beers.
A few laughs.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:02.471
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:17.944
Oh, fuck me, man.

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.823
That kid's already spent
all the money, man.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:23.158
New Vette? Hardly, Dude.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:28.581
I'd say he still has $960,000, $970,000
left, depending on the options.

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:30.291
Wait in the car, Donny.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.464
Yes?
Pilar?

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:41.803
My name is Walter Sobchak. This is
my associate, Jeffrey Lebowski.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.515
We came to talk
about little Larry.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.684
May we come in?
Yes, yes.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.102
Thank you.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.066
That's him, Dude.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:05.076
And a good day
to you, sir!

01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:07.161
Sit down, please.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:15.378
Larry, sweetie,
the man is here!

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:18.297
Is he...
Does he still write?

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:21.509
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:22.885
Uh-huh.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:26.681
Sir, I just want to say

01:10:27.682 --> 01:10:30.143
that we're both,
on a personal level,

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.604
really enormous fans.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:36.858
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:39.068
was truly a source
of inspiration.

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.946
Sweetie, sit down.
This man is the police.

01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:45.616
Oh, no, ma'am. V\Ie didn't want to give the
impression that we were police, exactly.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.453
V\Ie're hoping it won't be
necessary to call the police.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.997
But that's up to
little Larry here.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.707
Isn't it, Larry?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.720
Is this your homework,
Larry?

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.390
Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, man, it...

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.852
Dude. Please? ls this
your homework, Larry?

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.312
Just ask him about
the car, man.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.731
Is this yours, Larry? ls
this your homework, Larry?

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:18.024
Is that your car out front?

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:21.027
Is this your homework, Larry? We
know it's his fucking homework!

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.362
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.449
Look, Larry, have you
ever heard of Vietnam?

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:28.868
For Christ's sake, Walter. You are
entering a world of pain, son.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.621
We know that this is your homework.
We know that you stole the car.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:34.248
And the fucking money.
And the fucking money!

01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:36.000
And we know that
this is your homework!

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:37.293
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.337
You're killing
your father, Larry.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.592
All right.
This is pointless.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:48.554
Okay, time for Plan B.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:53.768
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

01:11:55.061 --> 01:11:58.439
Son, this is what happens when
you fuck a stranger in the ass!

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:02.068
A little language
problem here.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.529
Little prick's
stonewalling me.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:06.948
Walter.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.659
What are you doing, man?

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:14.080
What are you doing?

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:17.083
Here you go, Larry.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.168
You see what happens?

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.295
You see what happens, Larry?

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.881
You see what happens?
Oh, great.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:27.552
This is what happens when you fuck
a stranger in the ass, Larry.

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.223
This is what happens, Larry.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.141
You see what happens, Larry?

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:36.686
You see what happens when you
fuck a stranger in the ass?

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:38.980
This is what happens!

01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:41.232
You see what happens, Larry?

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:43.693
You see what happens, Larry?

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:47.488
Do you see what happens, Larry, when
you fuck a stranger in the ass?

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.283
This is what happens, Larry!

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.034
This is what happens, Larry!

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.871
My car! My baby!
This is what happens, Larry!

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.914
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:59.667
What the fuck are you
doing, man? Stop it!

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:02.253
Hey, man. I just bought
that fucking car last week!

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:05.381
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm sorry!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:08.634
I just bought the fucking car last week!
Come on, man.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.553
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.680
No, no. Hey, hey,
that's not his! Hey!

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:15.224
God damn it!
Whoa! Oh, no!

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.101
Fuck you!
Man. No.

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:19.687
You like that? Fuck you!

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.232
- I'll kill your fucking car!
- No. No, no. No.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.234
I'll kill your fucking car!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.174
I accept your apology.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:52.845
No, I just want to handle it
by myself from now on.

01:13:54.055 --> 01:13:56.098
No.No.No!

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:58.017
That has nothing
to do with it.

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:02.772
Yes, the car made it home.
You're calling me at home.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:09.153
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack!

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:13.366
Well, that's your perception.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:17.745
You know, Walter,
you're right.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.789
There is an unspoken
message here.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:22.291
It's, "Fuck you!
Leave me the fuck alone!"

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.046
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

01:14:44.647 --> 01:14:46.482
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.317
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:51.278
Jackie Treehorn knows which
Lebowski you are, Lebowski.

01:14:51.362 --> 01:14:54.198
Jackie Treehorn wants to
see the deadbeat Lebowski.

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.158
You're not dealing
with morons here.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.209
Hello, Dude.
Thanks for coming.

01:15:47.293 --> 01:15:48.961
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.592
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:56.677
Completely unspoiled.

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:59.972
What's your drink, Dude?
A White Russian. Thanks.

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:02.141
White Russian.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:06.729
How's the smut business, Jackie?
I wouldn't know, Dude.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:12.234
I deal in publishing,
entertainment, pofificaladvocacy.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:15.571
Which one's Logjammin'?
Yes, regrettably, it's true.

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:18.491
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.201
It's video, Dude.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.870
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:26.499
we can't afford to invest
in little extras like story,

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:30.252
production value, feelings.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:37.218
You know, people forget that the
brain is the biggest erogenous zone.

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:39.428
On you maybe.

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:41.430
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:44.433
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:47.228
in interactive
erotic software.

01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:51.398
Wave of the future, Dude.
100% electronic.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:55.361
Well, I still jerk off
manually.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:02.034
Of course you do. I can see you're
anxious for me to get to the point.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:04.829
Well, here it is, Dude.

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.497
Where's Bunny?

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:09.125
Well, I thought you might know that, man.
V\Ihy would I?

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:13.462
She only ran off to get away from
that rather sizable debt to me.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:15.965
No, she didn't run off.
She's been...

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.134
I heard that kidnapping story,
so save it.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:20.219
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:24.974
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:26.559
That's your business.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:30.479
All I'm saying is I want mine.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:31.814
Yeah, right, man.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:35.776
I mean, there are a lot of
facets to this,

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.778
a lot of interested parties.

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:39.530
Excuse me.

01:17:45.244 --> 01:17:46.328
Yeah?

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:48.455
Oh. yeah?

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:49.957
Where is that?

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.713
All right. Yeah.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.050
Excuse me.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.215
Forgive me.
No problemo, man.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:43.636
So, if I can find your money,

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:47.306
what's in it for the Dude?

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:50.559
Well, of course, there's that to discuss.
You want a refill?

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:54.104
Yeah, does the pope shit in the woods?
10% finder's fee.

01:18:54.188 --> 01:18:57.650
That all right?
Okay. Done, Jackie.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.903
I dig the way
you do business, man.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:04.615
Your money is being held by
a kid named Larry Sellers.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:07.451
He lives in North Hollywood
on Radford,

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:11.163
by the ln-N-Out Burger.

01:19:11.247 --> 01:19:12.289
Fucking brat.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:16.585
But I'm sure your goons can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:20.798
Flunking social studies.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:27.054
So, if you could just

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:31.433
write me a check for
my 10% of half a million,

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:34.603
5 grand,
I'll go out and mingle.

01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:41.527
You mix a hell of
a Caucasian, Jackie.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:45.114
Fifteen-year-old kid.

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:49.868
Is this some sort of a joke?
No. No joke.

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:54.790
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:56.041
Hi, fellas.

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:00.379
Kid just wanted a car.

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:07.052
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.887
Not greedy.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:11.932
It really

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.269
tied the room together.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.400
<i>Darkness washed
over the Dude.</i>

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:25.988
<i>Darker than a black steer's tokus
on a moonless prairie night.</i>

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.742
<i>There was no bottom.</i>

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.258
<i>Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah</i>

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.928
<i>What condition
my condition was in</i>

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:57.269
<i>I woke up this morning
with the sundown shining in</i>

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:05.611
<i>I found my mind in
a brown paper bag within</i>

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:12.743
<i>I tripped on a cloud
and fell-a eight miles high</i>

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:16.872
<i>I tore my mind on a jagged sky</i>

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:18.707
<i>I just dropped in</i>

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:22.961
<i>To see what condition
my condition was in</i>

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:26.006
<i>Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah</i>

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:29.385
<i>What condition
my condition was in</i>

01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:39.228
<i>I pushed my soul
in a deep, dark hole</i>

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:41.980
<i>And then I followed it in</i>

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:47.027
<i>I watched myself crawlin' out</i>

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:50.989
<i>As I was a-crawlin' in</i>

01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:54.076
<i>I got up so tight</i>

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.286
<i>I couldn't unwind</i>

01:21:56.370 --> 01:22:00.499
<i>I saw so much I broke my mind</i>

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:02.418
<i>I just dropped in</i>

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:06.213
<i>To see what condition
my condition was in</i>

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:17.766
<i>Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah</i>

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:21.103
<i>What condition
my condition was in</i>

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:30.779
<i>Someone painted "April Fool"</i>

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.490
<i>In big, black letters
on a "Dead End" sign</i>

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:39.496
<i>I had my foot on the gas
as I left the road</i>

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:43.167
<i>And blew out my mind</i>

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:48.088
<i>Eight miles out of Memphis
and I got no spare</i>

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:52.050
<i>Eight miles straight up
downtown somewhere</i>

01:22:52.384 --> 01:22:54.303
<i>I just dropped in</i>

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:58.724
<i>To see what condition
my condition was in</i>

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:02.478
<i>I said I just dropped in</i>

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:06.732
<i>To see what condition
my condition was in</i>

01:23:07.107 --> 01:23:10.194
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:23:10.277 --> 01:23:16.575
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:14.132
<i>He was innocent</i>

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.679
<i>Not a charge was true</i>

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:24.977
<i>And they say
he ran away branded</i>

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:40.200
ls this your only ID?

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.911
I know my rights, man.

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:46.790
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:49.585
I want a fucking lawyer,
man.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:53.839
L want Bill Kunstler, man,

01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.050
or Ron Kuby.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:25:00.304
Mr. Treehorn tells us
that he had to eject you

01:25:00.387 --> 01:25:02.389
from his garden party,

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:04.766
that you were drunk
and abusive.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:09.938
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:13.567
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.028
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.822
Now, we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:21.450
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.869
So let me make
something plain.

01:25:24.411 --> 01:25:28.498
I don't like you sucking around
bothering our citizens, Lebowski.

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.460
I don't like your
jerk-off name.

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:32.794
I don't like your
jerk-off face.

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:34.504
I don't like your
jerk-off behavior.

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:37.549
And I don't like you,
jerk-off.

01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:43.096
Do I make myself clear?

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:48.226
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:50.771
Ow!

01:25:50.854 --> 01:25:52.439
Fucking fascist!

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:56.234
Stay out of Malibu,
Lebowski.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:59.196
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:04.868
Keep your ugly, fucking, gold-bricking
ass out of my beach community.

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:07.704
<i>I want to sleep with you</i>

01:26:07.788 --> 01:26:10.916
<i>In the desert tonight</i>

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:16.797
<i>With a billion stars
all around</i>

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:20.842
Jesus, man. Could you
change the channel?

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:22.594
Fuck you, man! If you don't
like my fucking music,

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:24.179
get your own fucking cab!

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:25.347
I had a really rough...

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.182
I'll pull off to the side
and kick your ass out.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:31.978
Man, come on. I had a rough night,
and I hate the fucking Eagles, man.

01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:42.322
Out of my fucking cab! Out!
Man!

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.951
Man! Man! Hey!

01:26:57.129 --> 01:27:01.049
<i>There 's</i> a <i>thousand
pretty women waiting out there</i>

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:04.886
<i>And they're all livin'
devil may care</i>

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:08.557
<i>And I'm just the devil
with love to spare</i>

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:12.102
<i>So viva Las Vegas</i>

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:16.481
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:31.121
Oh, Jesus!

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.309
Jeffrey.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:55.103
Maude?
Love me.

01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.858
That's my robe.

01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.069
Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:06.156
Well, not much to tell.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:12.913
I was one of the authors
of the Port Huron Statement.

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:16.917
The original Port Huron Statement.
Uh-huh.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:20.921
Not the compromised
second draft.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:24.549
Then I...

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:28.261
You ever hear of
the Seattle Seven?

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:29.721
That was me.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:35.227
And there were
six other guys.

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.981
And then the music business,
briefly.

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.608
Oh?
Yeah.

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.401
Roadie for Metallica.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:44.528
Oh.

01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:46.112
Speed of Sound tour.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:47.864
Mmm-hmm.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.991
Bunch of assholes.

01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:54.663
And then, you know, little
of this, little of that.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:59.292
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:02.504
What do you do
for recreation?

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:04.756
Well, the usual.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.634
Bowl, drive around,

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:11.429
the occasional
acid flashback.

01:29:17.644 --> 01:29:19.729
What happened
to your house?

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:22.357
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.360
He thought I had
your father's money.

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:28.613
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.824
Cocktail?
No, thanks.

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:33.994
It's not my father's money.
It's the foundation's.

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:37.789
Why did he think you have it?
Who does?

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:42.335
Oh, Larry Sellers, this high school kid.
Real fucking brat.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:45.964
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:48.049
A lot of ins, a lot of outs.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:53.263
You know, fortunately, I'm adhering
to a pretty strict, drug regimen

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:55.599
to keep my mind,
you know, limber,

01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:59.227
and I'm very fucking close
to your father's money.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:01.938
I keep telling you, it's
the foundation's money.

01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:03.648
Father doesn't have any.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.402
What are you talking about?
He's fucking loaded.

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.821
No, no. The wealth
is all Mother's.

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:12.073
No, he runs stuff.

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:14.701
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

01:30:14.784 --> 01:30:17.704
but he didn't do very well at it.
Oh, he's, you know...

01:30:17.787 --> 01:30:20.165
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.876
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.628
He has no money of his own.

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:26.421
I know how he likes
to present himself.

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:29.799
Father's weakness is vanity,
hence the slut.

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:33.678
Do you think he...

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.514
What is that, yoga?

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:38.975
It increases the chances
ofconcepflon.

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:44.439
Increases...
Well, yes.

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:47.484
What did you think this was all about?
Fun and games?

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.110
L want a child.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:51.529
Okay, yeah, okay.

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:54.449
But let me... Let me explain
something about the Dude.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:57.994
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

01:30:58.078 --> 01:31:01.790
In fact, I don't want the father to
be someone I have to see socially

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:04.960
or who will have any interest
in raising the child himself.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:09.881
Oh. So, that doctor...
Exactly.

01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:13.843
Now, what happened
to your face?

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:16.596
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.977
No, it was the chief of police
of Malibu, a real reactionary.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:23.812
So, your father...

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:28.733
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Yeah. Yeah. What?

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:33.238
Oh,man. My thinking about this
case has become very uptight.

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.823
Yeah.

01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:36.241
Your father.

01:31:37.242 --> 01:31:40.245
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:43.248
Jeffrey!

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:46.126
Walter, if you're there, pick
up the fucking phone, man.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:48.211
Come on, Walter.

01:31:48.294 --> 01:31:51.506
Pick it up, man. This is an emergency.
<i>Dude ?</i> Dude <i>?</i>

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:55.552
Yeah. Listen, Walter. I'm at my place.
I need you to come pick me up.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:58.013
<i>I can't drive, Dude-
It's Erev shabbos.</i> What?

01:31:58.096 --> 01:31:59.514
Erev shabbos.
What?

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:02.767
Erev shabbos. <i>I</i> can't drive.
Man!

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:05.478
<i>I'm not even supposed to pick up the
phone unless it's an emergency.</i>

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:08.940
This is a fucking emergency!
<i>I</i> understand.

01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:10.608
<i>That's why I picked up
the phone.</i>

01:32:10.692 --> 01:32:13.987
Walter, you fuck.
We gotta go to Pasadena, man.

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:16.322
Come pick me up or I'm off
the fucking bowling team.

01:32:31.963 --> 01:32:34.424
Get out of that
fucking car, man!

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:37.761
Get out of that fucking car!

01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:40.138
Get the fuck
out of the car, man.

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.142
Get out of the fucking...

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:46.561
Who the fuck are you, man?
Easy, man!

01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:48.021
Relax, man.

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:50.774
No physical harm intended.

01:32:50.857 --> 01:32:53.568
Who the fuck are you? Why
you following me around?

01:32:53.693 --> 01:32:56.863
Come on, fuckhead! Relax, man.
I'm a brother shamus.

01:32:57.864 --> 01:32:59.407
Miner

01:33:01.159 --> 01:33:02.827
Like an Irish monk?

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:04.788
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:08.833
My name is Da Fino. I'm a
private snoop, like you, man.

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:12.170
What?
A dick, man.

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:15.381
And let me tell you something,
I dig your work.

01:33:15.465 --> 01:33:18.426
Playing one side against the
other, in bed with everybody.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.887
Fabulous stuff, man.
I'm not...

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.890
Fuck it, man. Just stay away
from my fucking lady friend.

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:26.518
Hey, I'm not messing
with your special lady.

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.104
She's not my special lady.
She's my fucking lady friend.

01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:31.981
I'm just helping her conceive, man!
Hey, man. I'm not...

01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:34.526
Who are you working for?
Lebowski?

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.027
Jackie Treehorn?

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:39.364
The Kneutsons.

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:43.368
Who the fuck are
the Kneutsons?

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:47.038
The Kneutsons, it's a
wandering daughter job.

01:33:48.414 --> 01:33:50.959
Bunny Lebowski, man.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.837
Her real name
is Fawn Kneutson.

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.880
Her parents
want her back, see?

01:33:57.048 --> 01:33:59.008
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:33:59.092 --> 01:34:02.011
Crazy, huh?
Ran away about a year ago.

01:34:02.095 --> 01:34:05.807
The Kneutsons told me I should
show her this when I found her.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:09.435
It's the family farm. It's
outside Moorhead, Minnesota.

01:34:09.561 --> 01:34:12.647
They think it'll make her homesick.
Oh, boy.

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.357
How are you gonna keep them
down on the farm

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.401
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:19.529
She's been kidnapped, DaFWm.
Oh,man.

01:34:19.612 --> 01:34:20.822
Or I don't know.
Maybe not.

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:22.490
But she's definitely
not around.

01:34:22.574 --> 01:34:26.494
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources,

01:34:26.911 --> 01:34:28.746
trade information.

01:34:28.872 --> 01:34:30.665
Professional courtesy?

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:32.333
Compeers.
You know what I mean?

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.961
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

01:34:35.044 --> 01:34:37.172
And stay away
from my special...

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:40.175
From my fucking
lady friend, man!

01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.679
The lingonberry pancake.

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.311
Lingonberry pancakes.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:56.774
Three pigs in blanket.

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.657
She has
lingonberry pancakes.

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:16.711
I mean, we totally fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his payoff.

01:35:16.794 --> 01:35:19.005
We got the kidnappers
all pissed off.

01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:21.341
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:23.551
but he didn't do
anything, huh?

01:35:23.676 --> 01:35:25.887
Well, sometimes it's a cathartic...
No, no.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:28.264
I'm saying that
if he knows I'm a fuckup,

01:35:28.348 --> 01:35:30.725
why does he leave me in charge
of getting his wife back?

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:34.145
<i>Because he doesn't
fucking want her back, man.</i>

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:37.398
<i>He's had enough. He no longer digs her.
It's all a show.</i>

01:35:37.482 --> 01:35:41.903
Okay, but then why doesn't he give
a shit about his million bucks?

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:44.656
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:46.824
<i>but he
never asked for it back.</i>

01:35:46.908 --> 01:35:49.994
<i>The million bucks
was never in the briefcase.</i>

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:53.706
<i>The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.</i>

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:56.459
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:59.087
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:02.924
Okay, but how does all this
add up to an emergency?

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:07.220
I'm saying, I see what you're getting
at, Dude. He kept the money.

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:09.138
My point is...

01:36:09.222 --> 01:36:12.433
Here we are, it's shabbos,
the Sabbath,

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:16.562
which I'm allowed to break only if
it's a matter of life or death.

01:36:16.646 --> 01:36:19.983
VVill you come off it, Walter?
You're not even fucking Jewish, man.

01:36:20.066 --> 01:36:21.734
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:23.194
Man, you're fucking
Polish Catholic!

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:24.904
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:36:24.988 --> 01:36:27.115
I converted when I married Cynthia.
Come on, Dude.

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:29.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know this.

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.536
And five fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.121
So what are you saying?
When you get divorced,

01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:35.331
you turn in your library card?
You get a new license?

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:38.501
You stop being Jewish?
This is the driveway.

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:40.628
Jewish as fucking Tevye.
Man.

01:36:40.712 --> 01:36:44.966
You know, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

01:36:45.049 --> 01:36:48.970
Man, taking care of her fucking dog,
going to her fucking synagogue.

01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:50.888
You're living in
the fucking past.

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:54.309
Three thousand years of beautiful
tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax.

01:36:54.392 --> 01:36:57.353
You're goddamn right I'm
living in the fucking past!

01:36:57.437 --> 01:36:59.564
I've... Jesus.

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:02.734
What the hell happened?

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:06.487
<i>So viva Las Vegas</i>

01:37:07.905 --> 01:37:10.825
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:17.749
Let's go. Fuck it.

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:23.504
Where was she, man?

01:37:23.588 --> 01:37:25.590
Visiting friends of hers
in Palm Springs.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:28.092
She just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.678
Well,I guess the fucking
nihilists knew where she was.

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:32.930
Jesus, Dude. She never
even kidnapped herself.

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:36.392
Who is this gentleman, Dude? Who am I?
I'm a fucking veteran.

01:37:36.476 --> 01:37:37.685
Come on!
That's who I am.

01:37:37.769 --> 01:37:40.313
You shouldn't go in there, Dude.
He's very angry.

01:37:42.648 --> 01:37:44.025
So, man.

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:47.904
So? She's back,
no thanks to you.

01:37:47.987 --> 01:37:50.365
Where's the fucking money,
Lebowski?

01:37:50.448 --> 01:37:53.785
A million bucks from fucking,
needy, little Urban Achievers!

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:55.370
You are scum, man!

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:57.705
Who the hell is he?
Who am I? Who am I?

01:37:57.789 --> 01:37:59.374
Walter. I'm the guy that's
gonna kick your phony,

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:00.792
gold-bricking ass, that's who I am.
Man.

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.710
We know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

01:38:02.794 --> 01:38:04.837
We know you kept the million
bucks for yourself.

01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:06.506
You have your story,
I have mine.

01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:09.884
I say I entrusted the money
to you and you stole it.

01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:13.179
As if we would ever dream of
taking your bullshit money!

01:38:13.262 --> 01:38:15.473
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:17.141
and you were
fucking glad, man.

01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:19.477
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.855
All you needed was a sap to pin it on.
You just met me.

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:25.858
You... You human paraquat.

01:38:25.942 --> 01:38:29.404
You figured, "Oh, here's a
loser, you know, a deadbeat.

01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:32.073
"Somebody this square community
won't give a shit about."

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:33.741
Well, aren't you?

01:38:34.992 --> 01:38:38.746
Well, yeah, but...
Get out, both of you.

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:42.083
Look at that fucking phony, Dude,
pretending to be a fucking millionaire.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:44.460
Out of this house now,
you bums!

01:38:44.544 --> 01:38:46.129
Let me tell you
something else.

01:38:46.212 --> 01:38:49.966
I've seen a lot of spinals,
Dude, and this guy's a fake.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:53.845
A fucking gold-bricker.
Stay away from me, mister!

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:55.596
This guy fucking walks.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.015
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:59.267
You stay away from me!

01:38:59.350 --> 01:39:01.769
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man! He's a cripple.

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.563
I said! Get away from me!
Come on. Come on.

01:39:03.729 --> 01:39:07.191
Walter, put him down, man!

01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:10.945
Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude.
Walk! Achtung, baby!

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:31.340
Come on, man. Help me
put him back in his chair.

01:39:35.261 --> 01:39:37.263
At least they had the
fucking decency to tell us

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:39.724
that we were fighting
the communists.

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:45.646
Whereas this whole fucking
thing, this whole fucking thing

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:48.566
is nothing about nothing,
about oil,

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.985
which is what I personally
hear, Dude.

01:39:51.068 --> 01:39:53.362
Sure you'll see
some tank battles,

01:39:53.446 --> 01:39:56.991
but fighting in desert is very different
from fighting in canopyjungle.

01:39:58.075 --> 01:40:01.496
I mean, Nam was a foot soldier's
war, whereas this thing should...

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:04.707
You know, should be
a piece of cake.

01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:08.211
I mean, I had an M16, Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

01:40:08.336 --> 01:40:11.714
Me and Charlie, eyeball to eyeball.
Yeah.

01:40:11.797 --> 01:40:14.133
That's fucking combat.

01:40:14.217 --> 01:40:17.094
The man in the black
pajamas, Dude.

01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:19.055
Worthy fucking adversary.

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:22.558
Who's in pajamas, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

01:40:22.642 --> 01:40:24.852
Whereas what we have here,

01:40:24.936 --> 01:40:27.104
a bunch of fig eaters wearing
towels on their head,

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:29.357
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

01:40:30.233 --> 01:40:32.401
- This is not a worthy fucking adversary.
- Hey!

01:40:32.485 --> 01:40:34.529
What's this
day-of-rest shit?

01:40:34.612 --> 01:40:36.197
What's this bullshit?

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.325
I don't fucking care!
It don't matter to Jesus.

01:40:39.408 --> 01:40:40.868
But you not fooling me,
man.

01:40:40.952 --> 01:40:43.663
You might fool the fucks
in the league office

01:40:43.746 --> 01:40:46.040
but you don't fool Jesus.

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:48.918
It's Bush league
psych-out stuff.

01:40:49.001 --> 01:40:50.419
Laughable, man!

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:54.674
I would've fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

01:40:55.424 --> 01:40:58.344
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:02.265
You got a date
VVednesday,baby!

01:41:07.144 --> 01:41:08.312
He's cracking.

01:41:08.396 --> 01:41:10.106
...the whole concept of age.

01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:12.400
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this

01:41:12.483 --> 01:41:15.319
but in the 14th century,
the Rambam...

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:27.540
Well, they finally
did it.

01:41:27.623 --> 01:41:29.750
They killed
my fucking car.

01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:33.421
We want the money,
Lebowski.

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:36.007
Ja. Otherwise,
we kill the girl.

01:41:36.090 --> 01:41:39.594
Ja- It seems you have forgotten
our little deal, Lebowski.

01:41:39.677 --> 01:41:42.430
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:44.765
We know you never did.

01:41:44.849 --> 01:41:46.434
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:48.227
No, Donny.
These men are nihilists.

01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:49.729
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

01:41:51.397 --> 01:41:52.481
We don't care.

01:41:52.565 --> 01:41:57.028
We still want the money,
Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

01:41:57.111 --> 01:41:59.780
Fuck you. Fuck the three of you.
Cool it, Walter.

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:03.701
No. Without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:07.121
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

01:42:07.204 --> 01:42:09.540
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

01:42:09.624 --> 01:42:11.959
She thought we could
get $1 million.

01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:14.545
It's not fair.
Fair?

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:18.257
V\Iho's the fucking nihilists around
here, you bunch of fucking crybabies?

01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:20.718
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.511
There never
was any money.

01:42:22.595 --> 01:42:24.722
The big Lebowski gave me
an empty briefcase,

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.849
so take it up with him, man.

01:42:26.932 --> 01:42:29.477
And I would like
my undies back.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.770
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:33.314
No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

01:42:33.397 --> 01:42:34.690
Okay!

01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:38.319
So we takes the money you have
on you, and we calls it even.

01:42:39.737 --> 01:42:41.781
Fuck you.
Hey, no. Come on, Walter.

01:42:41.864 --> 01:42:43.866
Come on, we're ending
this thing cheap, man.

01:42:43.949 --> 01:42:46.535
No. What's mine is mine.
No, come on, Walter.

01:42:46.619 --> 01:42:48.829
No funny stuff.
All right. All right.

01:42:48.913 --> 01:42:53.668
No funny stuff.
I got 4 bucks, almost 5.

01:42:53.751 --> 01:42:56.337
- Igot$18.
- What's mine is mine.

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.548
We fuck you up, man!
We takes the money!

01:43:00.091 --> 01:43:01.425
Come and get it.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.014
We fuck you up! Show me
what you got, nihilists.

01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:09.558
I fuck you! Walter, come on.
He's got a sword.

01:43:09.642 --> 01:43:11.852
Fucking dipshit with
a nine-toed woman!

01:43:11.936 --> 01:43:15.773
I fuck you! Fuck you!
I fuck you!

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:23.614
Take it easy, man.
I fuck you!

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:25.616
Take the $4.
I fuck you!

01:43:29.954 --> 01:43:30.996
I fuck you!

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:32.957
I'm gonna hit you with
the fucking ball, man.

01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:39.839
Hey, dickhead!
Anti-Semite.

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:43.509
I fuck you in the ass!
I fuck you in the ass!

01:43:43.592 --> 01:43:46.721
I fuck you! I fuck you!

01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:48.806
I fuck you! I fuck you!

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:57.022
We got a man down, Dude!

01:44:00.735 --> 01:44:01.944
Oh, God. They shot him, man.

01:44:02.027 --> 01:44:04.238
He's not shot. No, Dude.
Are you shot, Donny?

01:44:04.363 --> 01:44:06.657
There weren't any shots fired.
Huh?

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:09.994
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.

01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:13.372
I'd go myself, but I'm pumping
blood, might pass out.

01:44:13.456 --> 01:44:16.751
Rest easy, good buddy.
You're doing fine.

01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:19.253
We got help choppering in.

01:44:46.781 --> 01:44:48.449
Hello, gentlemen.

01:44:48.532 --> 01:44:50.785
You are the bereaved?
Yeah, man.

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:54.121
Francis Donnelly,
pleased to meet you.

01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:56.499
Jeff Lebowski.
Walter Sobchak.

01:44:56.582 --> 01:44:58.834
The Dude actually is...

01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:01.796
Excuse me?
Oh, nothing.

01:45:03.631 --> 01:45:08.302
Yes. I understand you're
taking away the remains?

01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:09.553
Yeah.

01:45:10.304 --> 01:45:12.097
We have the urn.

01:45:13.474 --> 01:45:15.684
I assume this is credit card?

01:45:16.894 --> 01:45:17.978
Yeah.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.078
What's this?

01:45:34.829 --> 01:45:36.497
Now, that's for the urn.

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.582
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:42.002
Yes. So we were informed.

01:45:42.086 --> 01:45:45.840
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains to you

01:45:45.923 --> 01:45:47.508
in a receptacle.

01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:50.553
That's $180.

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:54.807
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

01:45:55.140 --> 01:45:57.309
Well, can't we just...
$180?

01:45:57.393 --> 01:45:59.395
They range up to $3,000.

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:03.315
We're... Can't we just rent
it from you, you know?

01:46:03.399 --> 01:46:06.193
Sir, this is a mortuary
not a rental house.

01:46:06.318 --> 01:46:08.654
V\Ie're scattering the fucking ashes!
Walter, Walter.

01:46:08.737 --> 01:46:11.240
Just because we're bereaved
doesn't make us saps.

01:46:11.323 --> 01:46:13.701
Sir, please lower
your voices.

01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:17.872
Man, don't you have, you know,
something else we can put him in?

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:18.998
You know?

01:46:19.081 --> 01:46:22.126
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

01:46:22.418 --> 01:46:24.003
God damn it!

01:46:26.130 --> 01:46:27.798
Is there a Ralph's
around here?

01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:57.494
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

01:46:58.746 --> 01:47:00.873
He was one of us.

01:47:00.956 --> 01:47:04.877
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:08.756
And as a surfer he explored the
beaches of Southern California

01:47:08.839 --> 01:47:11.634
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

01:47:11.717 --> 01:47:14.303
and up to Pismo.

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:16.347
He died...

01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:21.435
He died as so many young men of
his generation, before his time.

01:47:21.518 --> 01:47:24.688
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him,

01:47:24.813 --> 01:47:28.108
as you took so many bright,
flowering young men

01:47:28.192 --> 01:47:31.028
at Khe Sanh, at Ian Doc,

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:32.863
at Hill 364.

01:47:34.156 --> 01:47:36.533
These young men
gave their lives,

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:38.577
and so did Donny.

01:47:40.704 --> 01:47:42.706
Donny, who loved bowling.

01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:46.752
And so,

01:47:48.379 --> 01:47:50.756
Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

01:47:52.049 --> 01:47:57.179
in accordance with what we think your
dying wishes might well have been,

01:47:58.514 --> 01:48:01.308
we commit your final
mortal remains

01:48:02.226 --> 01:48:04.603
to the bosom of
the Pacific Ocean

01:48:06.063 --> 01:48:08.065
which you loved so well.

01:48:10.401 --> 01:48:12.486
Good night, sweet prince.

01:48:27.626 --> 01:48:29.044
Shit.

01:48:30.963 --> 01:48:33.007
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.928
Goddamn wind.
Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

01:48:38.012 --> 01:48:40.305
You fucking asshole!
Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:42.599
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man!

01:48:42.683 --> 01:48:44.268
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:46.854
What was that shit about Vietnam?
Dude, I'm sorry.

01:48:46.937 --> 01:48:49.231
What the fuck does anything
have to do with Vietnam?

01:48:49.314 --> 01:48:51.316
Dude, I'm sorry. What the
fuck are you talking about?

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:52.985
Dude, I'm sorry.

01:48:55.904 --> 01:48:57.114
Fucking...

01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:05.581
Fuck, Walter.

01:49:07.458 --> 01:49:08.959
Come on, Dude.

01:49:09.793 --> 01:49:11.462
Hey, fuck it, man.

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.009
Let's go bowling.

01:49:40.491 --> 01:49:43.827
<i>And when you're sittin' there</i>

01:49:44.453 --> 01:49:47.581
<i>In your silk upholstered chair</i>

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:53.128
<i>Talkin' to some rich folks
that you know</i>

01:49:56.465 --> 01:49:59.301
<i>Well, I hope you don't see me</i>

01:50:00.302 --> 01:50:03.514
<i>In my ragged company</i>

01:50:04.306 --> 01:50:09.353
<i>Oh, but you know
I could never be alone</i>

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:14.525
Two oat sodas, Gary.
Right. Good luck tomorrow.

01:50:14.608 --> 01:50:18.070
Yeah, thanks, man. I was
sorry to hear about Donny.

01:50:18.153 --> 01:50:21.031
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

01:50:21.865 --> 01:50:25.828
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes, you know...

01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:27.204
Hey, man.

01:50:27.996 --> 01:50:31.166
How do you do, Dude? I
wondered if I'd see you again.

01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:33.293
I wouldn't miss
the semis.

01:50:33.377 --> 01:50:35.003
Oh, yeah?
How's things been going?

01:50:35.087 --> 01:50:38.215
Well, you know, strikes and
gutters, ups and downs.

01:50:38.298 --> 01:50:41.009
Sure. I got you.
Yeah.

01:50:42.553 --> 01:50:43.595
Thanks, Gary.

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:46.014
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

01:50:46.098 --> 01:50:49.143
Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
Oh, yeah.

01:50:49.226 --> 01:50:51.311
I know that you will.

01:50:51.395 --> 01:50:54.731
Yeah. Well,
the Dude abides.

01:50:58.735 --> 01:50:59.945
Walter.

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:03.615
The Dude abides.

01:51:07.536 --> 01:51:10.873
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:14.376
It's good knowing
he's out there,

01:51:14.459 --> 01:51:18.547
the Dude, taking her easy
for all us sinners.

01:51:21.258 --> 01:51:23.427
I sure hope
he makes the finals.

01:51:25.053 --> 01:51:27.181
Well, that about does her.

01:51:27.264 --> 01:51:28.765
Wraps her all up.

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:33.812
Things seem to have worked out
pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

01:51:34.479 --> 01:51:37.774
And it was a pretty good
story, don't you think?

01:51:38.609 --> 01:51:40.944
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

01:51:41.612 --> 01:51:43.071
Parts anyway.

01:51:44.615 --> 01:51:46.783
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:52.956
But then I happen to know that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.

01:51:54.625 --> 01:51:57.961
I guess that's the way the whole
darned human comedy keeps

01:51:58.503 --> 01:52:00.839
perpetuating itself

01:52:00.923 --> 01:52:03.091
down through the generations.

01:52:03.592 --> 01:52:07.846
Westward the wagons, across
the sands of time until we...

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:12.267
Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

01:52:13.644 --> 01:52:16.146
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

01:52:16.647 --> 01:52:18.982
Catch you later on
down the trail.

01:52:20.150 --> 01:52:23.278
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?

01:52:46.218 --> 01:52:50.222
<i>Take me down, little Susie</i>

01:52:50.305 --> 01:52:52.140
<i>Take me down</i>

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:57.938
<i>I know you think
you're the queen</i>

01:52:58.021 --> 01:53:00.148
<i>Of the underground</i>

01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:08.824
<i>Send me dead flowers
every morning</i>

01:53:12.202 --> 01:53:16.707
<i>Send me dead flowers
by the mail</i>

01:53:20.502 --> 01:53:24.965
<i>Send me dead flowers
to my wedding</i>

01:53:27.509 --> 01:53:34.474
<i>And I won't forget to put
roses on your grave</i>

01:53:35.767 --> 01:53:40.105
<i>No, I won't forget
to put roses</i>

01:53:40.188 --> 01:53:44.484
<i>On your grave</i>

01:54:09.593 --> 01:54:14.139
<i>Bright light city
gonna set my soul</i>

01:54:14.598 --> 01:54:18.310
<i>Gonna set my soul on fire</i>

01:54:19.644 --> 01:54:24.775
<i>Got a whole lot of money
that's ready to burn</i>

01:54:24.858 --> 01:54:28.487
<i>So get those stakes up higher</i>

01:54:30.072 --> 01:54:34.826
<i>There's a thousand pretty
women livin' out there</i>

01:54:35.577 --> 01:54:40.665
<i>They're all livin'
devil may care</i>

01:54:40.749 --> 01:54:45.212
<i>And I'm just a devil
with love to spare</i>

01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:49.549
<i>So viva Las Vegas</i>

01:54:51.093 --> 01:54:55.138
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:03.522
<i>Viva Las Vegas
with your neon flashing</i>

01:55:03.605 --> 01:55:06.566
<i>And your one-arm
bandits crashing</i>

01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:10.237
<i>All those hopes down the drain</i>

01:55:11.822 --> 01:55:16.993
<i>Viva Las Vegas turnin'
day into nighttime</i>

01:55:17.077 --> 01:55:19.579
<i>Night into daytime</i>

01:55:19.663 --> 01:55:21.832
<i>If you see it once</i>

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:28.338
<i>You'll never be the same again</i>

01:55:30.382 --> 01:55:34.845
<i>I'm gonna keep on
keep on runnin'</i>

01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:38.682
<i>If it costs me
my very last dime</i>

01:55:40.183 --> 01:55:42.519
<i>If I wind up broke</i>

01:55:42.602 --> 01:55:44.813
<i>Well, I'll always remember</i>

01:55:44.896 --> 01:55:48.942
<i>That I had a swingin' time</i>

01:55:50.777 --> 01:55:54.865
<i>I'm gonna give it
everything I've got</i>

01:55:55.991 --> 01:56:00.203
<i>Lady Luck, please
let the dice stay hot</i>

01:56:01.121 --> 01:56:05.625
<i>Let me shoot a seven
on every shot</i>

01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:09.921
<i>So viva Las Vegas</i>

01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:15.218
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

01:56:16.595 --> 01:56:20.807
<i>Viva Las Vegas</i>

01:56:21.683 --> 01:56:23.560
<i>Viva</i>

01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:26.062
<i>Viva</i>

01:56:27.022 --> 01:56:28.523
<i>Viva</i>

01:56:29.608 --> 01:56:32.861
<i>Viva</i>

01:56:34.112 --> 01:56:40.911
<i>Las Vegas</i>
