00:28.295 --> 00:30.395
CABBIE: Well,
this day was a wash.

00:30.430 --> 00:34.466
Ten hour shift,
all for one fare between
Tamaran and Korugar.

00:34.501 --> 00:39.604
I think I'll drop by Elle's
Diner, flirt with Darlene,
and call it a... Huh?

00:39.639 --> 00:41.907
Woah!
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

00:41.942 --> 00:43.575
(ALARM BEEPING)

00:45.712 --> 00:48.413
-What's... Su... Superman?
-(GROANING)

00:48.448 --> 00:50.248
Hey you're, you're Superman,

00:50.283 --> 00:52.884
I... Wow!
Superman in my space cab!

00:52.919 --> 00:55.020
-Drive.
-Yes sir! Where to?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.888
Away from them.

00:56.923 --> 01:00.292
Can't believe you took
Superman out with one zap,
Lobo.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.127
Yeah, Jonas, I always pack

01:02.162 --> 01:05.531
a red sun power blaster
just for old Blue Boy.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.202
-(METER DINGS)
-(ENGINE REVVING)

01:17.911 --> 01:21.580
In addition to everything
else, you got Lobo after you?

01:21.615 --> 01:24.516
I kind of took out a loan from
Boss Kack, the gangster,

01:24.551 --> 01:26.785
to finance my last conquest.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.320
You welched on the loan.

01:28.355 --> 01:31.189
If by "welched" you mean
trying to blow up Kack

01:31.224 --> 01:33.825
when he came looking
for his money, yes...

01:33.860 --> 01:35.594
Yes, I did.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.995
Radio.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.698
Kind of an awkward time
to listen to music,
don't you think?

01:40.700 --> 01:42.367
Oh, that radio.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.871
Superman to Justice League,
looks like I'll need backup
after all.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.206
That's okay, Mr. Superman,
you rest easy.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.075
I've never lost
a passenger yet.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.344
(LOUD RATTLING)

01:54.548 --> 01:57.015
Watch out, you clumsy hack!

01:57.050 --> 01:59.317
Another jolt and
I'll have your license!

01:59.352 --> 02:01.419
So, why do you have him again?

02:01.454 --> 02:04.923
This intergalactic terrorist
was found guilty
by the galactic court.

02:04.958 --> 02:09.194
It's my job to escort him to
Justice League headquarters
where he belongs.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.798
Space Cabbie! Sup, my brother!

02:13.833 --> 02:16.668
What's say you hand
over Supes and the worm

02:16.703 --> 02:20.238
and we'll cut you in for
a sweet taste of our reward.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.040
I'm sorry, Mr. Lobo,
I can't do that.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.043
I, as a loyal employee of
the Nine Planet Taxi Company,

02:25.078 --> 02:29.848
I'm in charge of the comfort
and safety of my...

02:29.883 --> 02:31.416
Oh! Skates!

02:37.457 --> 02:40.959
No one makes a chump
out of the main man!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.861
(YELLING) No one!

02:50.036 --> 02:53.338
-MR. MIND: What happened?
-Lobo's negative ion grenade,

02:53.373 --> 02:55.473
it shorted out my cab's
power core!

02:55.508 --> 02:58.710
Excellent shot, Bo,
now all we gotta do

02:58.745 --> 03:00.345
is turn the worm over
to Boss Kack

03:00.380 --> 03:02.247
and share that fat reward.

03:02.282 --> 03:06.985
Woah, Jonas. That blast must
have fried your brains, bro!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.286
Huh?

03:08.321 --> 03:09.955
Yeah, you're using
a lot of alien words

03:09.990 --> 03:14.092
I've never heard before,
like "we" and "share."

03:14.127 --> 03:16.228
Why, you dirty little...

03:17.330 --> 03:19.264
(GRUNTING)

03:21.768 --> 03:24.903
Yeah, you better
"unlax" a while.

03:24.938 --> 03:28.406
And don't worry!
I'll take care of the reward.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.775
That's a word I understand.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.143
(ENGINE REVVING)

03:54.067 --> 03:55.467
What hit me?

04:00.573 --> 04:04.209
A chicken nugget?
I'm actually fighting

04:04.244 --> 04:07.012
a king sized,
walking chicken nugget!

04:07.047 --> 04:09.881
You've interfered with Justice
League business.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.650
Leave this area now.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.953
Listen, foghorn,
you're going to have to...

04:14.988 --> 04:15.988
(GRUNTS)

04:20.393 --> 04:21.760
Okay.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.430
All right.
Big bird's got some game!

04:25.465 --> 04:29.267
But the main man plays dirty.

04:46.519 --> 04:49.421
Lobo's taking off!
Well that's a break for us.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.423
Lobo never leaves
without his bounty.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.591
He's leading Hawkman
into a trap.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.927
Maybe if I focus
hard enough, I...

05:03.236 --> 05:05.470
He's heading for that
abandoned anthracite mine.

05:05.505 --> 05:08.373
Cabbie, we've got to
stop that ambush.

05:08.408 --> 05:09.841
I'll break out the jack.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.550
LOBO: Yeah! Looking for me?

extra crispy.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.740
I thought you were
down for the count!

05:41.775 --> 05:44.642
Your red sun energy blaster
may drain me, Lobo,

05:44.677 --> 05:46.745
but yellow sun recharges me.

nobody fights better than...

Where'd he go?

Hmm, transwarp drive with a
triple fusion power core.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.456
Very nice.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.491
I'll just rewire this heap to
blow up

06:33.526 --> 06:36.594

the Justice League

-The same.
-Mr. Mind, the ruthless
evil intergalactic villain?

MR. MIND: I prefer
visionary iconoclast,
but all right.

Mr. Mind, sir, I've had a
lot of celebrities in my cab

07:37.423 --> 07:39.591
but never anyone
of your stature.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.593
I'd think not.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.061
It would mean the galaxy to me

07:43.096 --> 07:45.430
if I could just get a picture
of us together.

any cash on me, uh...
