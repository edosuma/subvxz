15:11.911 --> 15:13.880
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

15:13.947 --> 15:18.218
BUT YOU'LL FIND
ANOTHER GUY.

15:18.285 --> 15:22.089
REMEMBER, NEWSWEEK
HEALS ALL WOUNDS.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.031
DON'T YOU MEAN...

15:31.098 --> 15:34.968
TIME HEALS
ALL WOUNDS?

15:38.071 --> 15:43.410
I KNEW IT'S ONE
OF THOSE MAGAZINES.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.981
WELL, WALDO...

15:48.048 --> 15:50.783
THANKS
FOR LETTING ME DOWN
SO GENTLY.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.920
NO. THANK YOU, LAURA.
YOU'RE MY FIRST DATE.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.955
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.596
LAURA...

16:06.599 --> 16:08.068
YES?

16:08.135 --> 16:11.338
YOUR RING IS STUCK
IN MY TEETH.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.719
I'LL RETURN YOUR RING
AS SOON AS I CAN.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.426
SO, HOW WAS
YOUR DREAM DATE?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.995
NOT SO HOT.
WALDO DUMPED ME.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.664
HE DID?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.966
I MEAN,
DARN THE LUCK.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.302
STEVE, I WANT
TO GO HOME.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.171
IT'S BEEN
A GRUELING NIGHT.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.307
WELL, NOW THAT WALDO'S
OUT OF THE PICTURE,

16:47.374 --> 16:51.278
DOES THAT MAKE ME
YOUR NUMBER-ONE REJECT?

16:51.344 --> 16:54.481
SURE. THERE'S NO ONE
I WANT TO SAY NO TO

16:54.547 --> 16:56.216
MORE THAN YOU.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.117
WOW!

16:59.086 --> 17:00.753
[IMITATES ROCKET]

17:02.355 --> 17:05.725
WINSLOW, YOUR MOTHER
IS JUST TOO OLD
TO DRIVE.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.294
OH, SHE IS NOT!

17:07.360 --> 17:08.428
IS, TOO!

17:08.495 --> 17:10.130
I CALLED THE DMV

17:10.197 --> 17:13.766
AND FOUND OUT
HER DRIVER'S LICENSE
NUMBER IS 7.

17:16.069 --> 17:20.173
I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D STOP
THE MOTHER DRIVING JOKES.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.175
PUT HER IN A TANK,

17:22.242 --> 17:24.577
SHE'D WIN
THE MEDAL OF HONOR.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.913
QUIT DISSIN' MY MAMA.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.315
WHAT?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.717
GENTLEMEN, IS THERE
A PROBLEM HERE?

17:30.783 --> 17:33.786
I'LL SAY
WHATEVER I WANT
WHENEVER I WANT.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.021
YEAH?
YEAH.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.056
ANYBODY WANT
A FROZEN BANANA?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.492
YOU APOLOGIZE TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.727
WHAT IF I DON'T?

17:40.793 --> 17:43.763
THEN I'LL STUFF YOU
INTO THIS COFFEE MUG.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.299
YOU BETTER BRING
LOTS OF HELP.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.067
DON'T BREAK THE CHINA.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.869
NOW...
NOW, HERE'S A THOUGHT.

17:49.936 --> 17:55.108
WHY DON'T THE BOTH OF YOU
GRAB A NICE COZY BOOTH?

17:55.175 --> 17:57.677
AND I'LL BRING YOU TWO

17:57.744 --> 18:01.414
A BIG SLICE OF PIE.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.449
PIE?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.751
I L-LOVE PIE.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.796
YOU WANT SOME PIE,
WINSLOW?

18:16.863 --> 18:19.031
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.901
OH, I WOULDN'T,
WOULD I?

18:21.968 --> 18:23.570
HERE'S YOUR PIE.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.871
AAH!

18:38.518 --> 18:40.987
CHOCOLATE CREAM.
DELICIOUS.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.755
MMM.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.756
BUT...

18:43.823 --> 18:47.260
I'VE GOT A DIFFERENT
KIND OF PIE FOR YOU.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.095
OH, REALLY? UH...

18:49.162 --> 18:52.031
WHAT KIND OF PIE
WOULD THAT BE?

18:52.098 --> 18:55.134
OH, IT'S CALLED
HUMBLE PIE.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.951
OKAY.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.455
THAT DOES IT!

19:17.624 --> 19:22.161
I'VE HAD JUST ABOUT
ENOUGH DESSERT.

19:24.631 --> 19:30.169
YOU SEE, IF THERE'S
ONE THING I REALLY HATE...

19:31.204 --> 19:33.172
IT'S EATING ALONE.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.218
ONE PIE...

19:45.285 --> 19:47.320
TWO GUYS.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.722
WHICH GUY'S GOING
TO GET THE PIE?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.190
NOW--NOW--NOW,
STEVE.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.292
PLACE YOUR BETS.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.126
DROP IT, NERD.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.195
I CAN SEE IT NOW!

19:57.630 --> 19:59.065
OH!

19:59.131 --> 20:00.567
OH!

20:00.633 --> 20:02.001
OHH!

20:02.068 --> 20:04.036
OH! OH, LAURA.

20:04.103 --> 20:07.039
OH, OH, OH, OH.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.076
OH, I'M SO SORRY,

TIME FOR ME
TO PUNCH OUT.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.221
OH, COME BACK.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.890
I'LL PUNCH YOU OUT.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.131
WOULD YOU LOOK AT US?

20:32.198 --> 20:34.367
TWO OF CHICAGO'S FINEST...

20:34.434 --> 20:36.369
THROWING PIES.

20:37.837 --> 20:38.905
WINSLOW...

20:38.971 --> 20:40.340
I'M SORRY.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.275
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE MADE
DISPARAGING REMARKS

20:42.342 --> 20:43.876
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.847
I RESPECT YOU,
AND I SHOULD SHOW
YOUR FAMILY RESPECT.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.316
I APPRECIATE THAT, SIR.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.617
THAT'S BIG OF YOU

20:50.683 --> 20:52.652

WHEN YOU'RE WRONG.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.822
YES, IT IS.
I'M VERY BIG THAT WAY.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.056
FRIENDS?

20:57.123 --> 20:59.859
FRIENDS.

20:59.926 --> 21:03.696
AND TO SHOW YOU JUST
HOW SORRY I AM...

21:06.265 --> 21:07.700

21:09.068 --> 21:11.037
THIS PIE...

21:11.103 --> 21:12.639
IS FOR YOU.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.286
YOU KNOW, SIR,
THAT'S QUITE A GESTURE.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.988
THANK YOU.

21:31.991 --> 21:32.959
YOU'RE WELCOME.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.361
BUT, YOU KNOW,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.596
I'D LIKE TO MATCH
THAT GESTURE

21:36.663 --> 21:39.666
WITH A GESTURE
OF MY OWN.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.767
OH...

21:40.833 --> 21:41.801
YES!

21:41.868 --> 21:42.835
