01:22.108 --> 01:23.825
Holy shit! Shit!

01:24.860 --> 01:25.826
It's okay.

01:25.894 --> 01:27.077
We'll be all right.

01:27.145 --> 01:28.429
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

01:28.496 --> 01:29.929
- Shh. Be cool.
- No, we are far from cool!

01:29.996 --> 01:31.781
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

01:31.848 --> 01:32.382
Oh, fuck.

01:32.449 --> 01:33.516
What's happening?

01:33.583 --> 01:35.285
She's bleeding. Is she okay?

01:35.402 --> 01:36.753
I... I don't know. I don't know.

01:36.821 --> 01:38.738
Why the fuck is she
bleeding so much?

01:38.806 --> 01:40.723
'Cause she's shot in the fucking face.
What do you think?

01:40.791 --> 01:42.008
Shit!

01:42.076 --> 01:43.309
Hold on, man.

01:43.377 --> 01:45.827
- What the fuck?
- Everybody hold on.

01:45.895 --> 01:46.678
Hold on!

04:00.120 --> 04:01.371
Hi, Ms. Williams.

04:31.065 --> 04:32.766
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

04:32.834 --> 04:35.236
Don't worry. We're still
waiting on Michael.

04:35.303 --> 04:37.271
Shit. Did someone call him?

04:37.338 --> 04:39.106
No. You want me to?

04:39.173 --> 04:41.442
No. I'll call him.

04:48.032 --> 04:49.166
Hello.

04:49.233 --> 04:51.034
Hi. It's Carley.

04:51.101 --> 04:52.418
Um...

04:52.486 --> 04:53.970
You coming to school?

04:54.038 --> 04:55.539
Oh, shit.

04:55.606 --> 04:57.339
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

04:57.407 --> 04:59.775
Um, all right.
I'll be right there.

05:02.879 --> 05:05.114
Babe, where are you going?

05:05.181 --> 05:07.016
I gotta go.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.467
Where?

05:08.535 --> 05:11.203
It's a group class thing.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.770
Right now?

05:12.837 --> 05:13.888
Come on, Lena.

05:13.956 --> 05:16.607
You're not gonna be
insecure about this, too.

05:16.675 --> 05:19.444
No. I'm not insecure.

05:24.917 --> 05:27.784
Okay. Well, are we
still on for tonight?

05:27.852 --> 05:29.936
Uh, I can't tonight, baby.

05:32.307 --> 05:34.057
Another group?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.392
I got a thing.

05:35.459 --> 05:38.661
Listen, this insecurity thing
is really starting to wear...

05:38.729 --> 05:40.947
Why can't you just tell me
what you're doing tonight?

05:41.015 --> 05:44.383
Why do I have to?
Can't you just trust me?

05:46.670 --> 05:48.487
I gotta go.

05:48.555 --> 05:50.606
See you later.

05:50.674 --> 05:52.058
Wait.

05:53.410 --> 05:54.994
I love you.

06:28.325 --> 06:29.509
Morning, handsome.

06:29.576 --> 06:30.710
Hey, Ms. Brown.

06:30.778 --> 06:32.211
You look ravishing today.

06:32.279 --> 06:33.513
- Today?
- Always.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.349
Uh... Huh. You get
the final word yet?

06:36.416 --> 06:38.017
Nah, not yet.

06:39.753 --> 06:42.387
I'm gonna say
a prayer for you, kid.

06:42.455 --> 06:44.556
Appreciate it.

06:44.623 --> 06:45.957
Need all that I can get.

06:50.296 --> 06:51.863
Don't be late
for school, little man.

06:51.931 --> 06:54.516
Yeah. Yeah, I... I'm going.

06:56.885 --> 06:58.518
What's on your mind, Ray?

06:58.586 --> 07:00.988
I... Look, I know I'm
supposed to be on tonight,

07:01.056 --> 07:04.091
but you think it'd be okay
if I cut out a little early?

07:04.159 --> 07:05.058
Say what?!

07:05.126 --> 07:07.661
Can I cut out
a little early tonight?

07:07.729 --> 07:10.013
How early? I don't know.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.431
Early.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.718
So I gotta stay late and close?

07:14.785 --> 07:17.170
Can I go? Who is she?

07:18.505 --> 07:19.773
Come on, Uncle Duane.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.557
Come on. Come on. Come on.

07:21.625 --> 07:22.908
Who's the lucky lady?

07:22.976 --> 07:24.377
Can I go?

07:24.445 --> 07:26.678
Don't hold out on me, man.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.080
You're asking me
for a favor, so...

07:30.867 --> 07:32.417
Who is she?

07:32.485 --> 07:34.319
Her name's Sarah.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.123
Sarah.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.891
Dre!

07:40.959 --> 07:41.926
Whoo!

07:42.077 --> 07:43.344
Ha ha!

07:43.412 --> 07:44.611
Sarah.

07:44.679 --> 07:46.530
That's a nice name.

07:46.598 --> 07:49.066
That's a nice name.

07:57.541 --> 07:59.142
Go on. I'll see you
after school.

07:59.210 --> 08:00.143
Uh, what about...

08:00.211 --> 08:01.228
Go on. Go on, Ray.

08:06.801 --> 08:09.403
Out the back way. Out the back.

08:09.470 --> 08:11.503
Brother got a .22 out.

08:11.571 --> 08:12.755
What you mean?

08:12.823 --> 08:14.406
Drop that nigger, bro.

08:14.474 --> 08:16.875
Just, like,
rolled up on that ass.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.632
Gonna roll up and shoot
that game and shit.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.667
Ribs ready yet?

08:25.901 --> 08:28.652
Just started the fire.
We open at 11:00.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.154
Hey, come on, bro.
I'm hungry, cuz.

08:30.222 --> 08:31.873
Y'all ain't got
nothin' back there?

08:31.940 --> 08:35.126
Come back later. I'll have
something for you then.

08:35.260 --> 08:38.395
Why don't you go
fetch me some chips,

08:38.464 --> 08:39.797
a couple cokes.

08:54.529 --> 08:55.861
Keep the change.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.348
Let's get out of here.

08:59.883 --> 09:01.951
Fuck is you looking at?

09:07.390 --> 09:09.941
Now, everyone has
to get these exams signed

09:10.009 --> 09:11.976
by a parent or guardian, okay?

09:12.044 --> 09:14.746
Those of you with exceptions
know who you are,

09:14.814 --> 09:16.248
but unfortunately,

09:16.315 --> 09:20.885
some of you will be back
again for another semester,

09:20.953 --> 09:23.871
and some of you will be needing
to go to the front office

09:23.939 --> 09:28.375
to pick up your cap and gown
for graduation next week.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.211
Congratulations.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.552
Hi.

09:39.619 --> 09:41.287
What are you doing here?

09:41.354 --> 09:42.488
I live here. Heh.

09:42.556 --> 09:43.656
You pay rent here,

09:43.724 --> 09:45.558
but you don't
exactly live here.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.026
I forgot my key.

09:47.094 --> 09:48.561
Okay.

09:48.628 --> 09:50.429
I'm leaving him, so...

09:50.497 --> 09:52.264
You took his cat?

09:52.332 --> 09:53.432
Yes.

09:55.334 --> 09:56.401
Can I come in?

09:56.468 --> 09:58.553
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

09:58.588 --> 10:00.222
Come in.

10:00.290 --> 10:03.658
Oh, wow. Okay.

10:04.727 --> 10:06.127
Why?

10:06.195 --> 10:10.598
Well, I just don't think
he deserves the cat.

10:10.666 --> 10:12.866
Like, he doesn't
take care of her.

10:12.934 --> 10:14.602
He never cleans her litter box.

10:14.670 --> 10:15.870
She's always hungry.

10:15.937 --> 10:18.306
No, no, no. I mean with
you and Michael. Why?

10:23.795 --> 10:25.978
He's just...

10:26.046 --> 10:29.716
Nothing's ever
gonna change, you know?

10:29.784 --> 10:31.651
I mean,
he's never gonna change.

10:31.719 --> 10:34.287
There are all these girls,
and they just...

10:36.256 --> 10:38.825
I just feel really stupid.
That's all.

10:38.891 --> 10:41.494
Well, I hate to say
that I told you so.

10:44.380 --> 10:47.115
I just wish I didn't
love him so much.

10:47.183 --> 10:49.818
You need him...

10:50.086 --> 10:52.471
But you wish you
didn't need him so much.

10:52.539 --> 10:55.506
Nobody loves anyone that treats
them that badly. Coffee?

10:55.574 --> 10:57.842
Is that the strongest
thing we have?

10:57.909 --> 10:59.760
At this hour, yeah.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.401
When... when was this?

11:07.469 --> 11:08.835
Last weekend.

11:08.903 --> 11:11.638
I called you, but you were
out with the man-whore.

11:11.706 --> 11:13.256
I'm such an idiot.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.257
Mm-hmm.

11:18.996 --> 11:21.064
Well, you're better off
without him.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.985
I wish I could stay, but I
gotta go to class, so...

11:26.052 --> 11:27.587
No, that's fine.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.755
Just gonna be sitting here,

11:29.823 --> 11:32.157
watching soap operas
and wallowing.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.727
Okay, maybe I should stay.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.762
No, you're fine. Go.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.196
I know. Tonight we'll go out,

11:39.264 --> 11:41.633
and we'll have some fun, and
we'll forget all about it.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.385
Yeah.

11:45.288 --> 11:47.455
I'll call you after class.

11:47.523 --> 11:49.391
Yeah. All right.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.458
Hang in there.

12:43.825 --> 12:45.225
Mom?

13:17.641 --> 13:18.974
Hi, mom.

13:20.443 --> 13:21.277
Where you been?

13:21.344 --> 13:23.344
Boy, where you think I've been?

13:24.813 --> 13:27.582
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

13:29.084 --> 13:30.752
None of your goddamn business

13:30.819 --> 13:32.970
is where I've been,
you little bitch.

13:33.038 --> 13:35.773
Keep that shit down.
I need some sleep.

13:35.841 --> 13:37.024
Where have I been?

13:37.092 --> 13:39.326
Fuck you. Fuck you!

13:41.929 --> 13:43.213
Shit!

13:43.281 --> 13:44.798
- Holy shit.
- Shh.

13:44.800 --> 13:45.766
Be cool. It's okay.

13:45.833 --> 13:46.733
How the fuck is that?

13:46.801 --> 13:48.318
You just shot her
in the fucking face.

13:48.386 --> 13:50.053
Are you out of
your fucking mind, Kevin?

13:50.121 --> 13:51.638
Come on. She was
making a scene.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.938
And what do you think this is?!

13:53.005 --> 13:54.105
What do you think this is?!

13:54.341 --> 13:56.074
It's okay.

13:56.142 --> 13:59.327
Man, shut her the fuck up!
goddamn!

13:59.395 --> 14:00.479
Yo, put that out
of her face, okay?!

14:00.681 --> 14:02.715
You just freaking out!
Chill the fuck out!

14:02.782 --> 14:04.766
Fuck you care about
these bitches?

14:04.834 --> 14:06.118
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

14:06.186 --> 14:07.669
I'm trying to get this
under control, okay,

14:07.736 --> 14:10.405
so sit back and shut the
fuck up for a second.

14:10.472 --> 14:13.641
It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Shh.

14:17.896 --> 14:19.831
We could get her to a hospital.

14:19.899 --> 14:21.182
We need to get her...

14:21.249 --> 14:22.916
What the fuck did I tell you?

14:22.984 --> 14:25.736
Shut the fuck up! God.

14:27.922 --> 14:29.673
" My chick and the cold beer. "

14:29.675 --> 14:31.741
" Come and throw
kegs on me... "

14:31.809 --> 14:32.776
That's it.

14:32.844 --> 14:34.044
" Blow your whole set, "

14:34.112 --> 14:35.729
" niggas try to get
the best of me. "

14:35.796 --> 14:37.096
" Didn't succeed. "

14:37.164 --> 14:38.797
" Tey wound up
in the chesapeake. "

14:38.865 --> 14:41.000
" 20 sucking chests at sea, "

14:41.068 --> 14:42.401
" see, you neglect the beef. "

14:42.403 --> 14:43.720
" Don't disrespect this heat. "

14:43.787 --> 14:45.004
" Somebody, here it come, "

14:45.071 --> 14:46.806

14:48.425 --> 14:49.976

14:50.043 --> 14:51.693
" so I made
some new connections, "

14:51.761 --> 14:53.161
" to connect the streets. "

14:53.229 --> 14:55.947
" We own that
through the South and the West. "

14:56.015 --> 14:57.131
" Save it all for the get. "

14:57.200 --> 14:58.866
" Nigga, now we get respect. "

14:58.934 --> 15:00.252

" fo' sure, you's a goner. "

15:08.109 --> 15:09.676
" The pills and marijuana, "

15:09.744 --> 15:11.194

15:11.262 --> 15:13.663
" Yeah, we on the rise,
motherfuckin' 9 to 5. "

15:13.731 --> 15:15.799
Where the fuck are we?

15:16.868 --> 15:18.235
What are you doing?

15:18.303 --> 15:20.604
What, you trying to draw
attention to us?

15:20.671 --> 15:22.071
Fuck that.

15:22.139 --> 15:24.173
Do you see people
bouncing to hip-hop

15:24.341 --> 15:25.558
in this fucking neighborhood?

15:25.625 --> 15:26.725
Turn that shit down.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.227
What? We trying to blend in?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.780
I'm trying to get us the
fuck out of here, okay?

15:30.848 --> 15:33.299
We're in the land of fucking
Mayberry right now,

15:33.367 --> 15:34.784
and you're blasting
dumb-ass music.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.835
Sit back, and turn
that shit down.

15:40.990 --> 15:42.758
All the way down.

15:46.962 --> 15:48.397
Man, what is that?

15:48.464 --> 15:49.214
What?

15:49.281 --> 15:52.049
That Mayfair Huckleberry shit?

15:52.084 --> 15:53.317
From old fucking reruns.

15:53.384 --> 15:55.720
Fuck kind of question is that?

15:55.787 --> 15:58.155
Just sit back and fucking look
for signs for the highway

15:58.223 --> 15:59.523
so we can get this girl
to the hospital.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.292
What? No fucking way.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.327
We're not going
to the fucking hospital.

16:03.395 --> 16:04.645
Okay, what? You want
to let this girl

16:04.797 --> 16:06.029
bleed to death in the
back of the fucking car?

16:06.097 --> 16:07.297
Is that your fucking
plan, genius?

16:07.365 --> 16:08.731
It's better than showing up

16:08.799 --> 16:09.782
with a half-dead chick,

16:09.850 --> 16:11.851
just begging the cops
to bag us.

16:12.002 --> 16:16.456
I ain't about to go to
fucking jail for this shit.

16:18.292 --> 16:19.976
What's going on back there?

16:20.044 --> 16:21.143
Man, sit up!

16:21.210 --> 16:22.695
Will you put the gun down?

16:22.846 --> 16:24.630
How many times
I gotta tell you?

16:24.698 --> 16:25.647
Damn it.

16:28.184 --> 16:29.301
It's okay.

16:30.336 --> 16:31.654
What the fuck are you doing?

16:31.721 --> 16:33.622
I'm just trying
to stop the bleeding.

16:34.857 --> 16:36.507
Just put it down.

16:36.575 --> 16:37.575
Let her bleed.

16:37.642 --> 16:39.811
Let her do it.

16:43.632 --> 16:45.449
You go ahead.

16:49.305 --> 16:50.854
But the court struck
down the death penalty

16:50.921 --> 16:53.373
in Kennedy vs. Louisiana
because it was not

16:53.541 --> 16:54.524
a proportional reaction
to rape,

16:54.592 --> 16:56.310
not because it was
cruel and unusual.

16:56.377 --> 16:57.778
Yes, but the court
explicitly cited

16:57.845 --> 16:59.946
a national consensus
against the death penalty

17:00.214 --> 17:01.465
as a basis for their decision.

17:01.532 --> 17:03.300
A national consensus
in rape cases only,

17:03.368 --> 17:04.534
a premise, by the way,

17:04.685 --> 17:06.535
which the dissenting option
clearly discredited.

17:06.603 --> 17:09.521
The point is there are some
crimes so heinous in nature,

17:09.589 --> 17:12.191
they not only deserve, but they
demand the ultimate punishment.

17:12.492 --> 17:14.026
A punishment that is so
heinous in and of itself

17:14.093 --> 17:16.294
that almost all the Western nations
have outlawed it completely.

17:16.362 --> 17:17.946
Why do you guys think it is

17:18.013 --> 17:19.281
that the U.K.,
Germany, Spain, France

17:19.348 --> 17:20.781
and most of the civilized world

17:20.848 --> 17:22.433
have deemed capital
punishment cruel and unusual?

17:22.617 --> 17:23.702
Because they're wrong.

17:23.769 --> 17:24.786
Welcome, Mr. Hastings.

17:24.853 --> 17:25.987
Please come join your team.

17:26.055 --> 17:27.989
Oh. Sleeping beauty awakens.

17:28.056 --> 17:29.541
Proportionality is
the determining factor,

17:29.608 --> 17:31.525
as was stated in
Kennedy vs. Louisiana.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.495
And the death penalty
as it applies to murder

17:33.562 --> 17:34.395
is completely proportional

17:34.463 --> 17:35.895
and therefore
totally acceptable.

17:35.963 --> 17:38.749
Guys, you're not dealing
with the issue of morality.

17:38.934 --> 17:42.052
If we as a society believe that
it is morally wrong to murder,

17:42.119 --> 17:44.154
then how can we turn around
and murder someone

17:44.356 --> 17:45.389
in the name of morality?

17:45.456 --> 17:46.640
Because it's a bigger
issue than that.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.258
We're talking
about murder here.

17:48.326 --> 17:50.009
The punishment has to be
as serious as the crime.

17:50.077 --> 17:51.027
We have to govern by example.

17:51.178 --> 17:52.562
Someone that needs
to be shown by example

17:52.629 --> 17:54.363
that it's wrong to kill
doesn't deserve to live.

17:54.598 --> 17:57.816
Spoken like the narrow-minded
son of privilege that you are.

17:57.884 --> 17:59.435
Okay, privileged or not,

17:59.503 --> 18:01.771
when you're born into this
world, you're given a ticket,

18:01.839 --> 18:04.273
a free pass that says
you're free to eat,

18:04.575 --> 18:06.224
breathe and pursue whatever
you want in this life,

18:06.291 --> 18:07.993
but there is one thing
that you cannot do.

18:08.060 --> 18:10.528
And if you choose to do it,
you turn in your ticket,

18:10.596 --> 18:12.230
and when you get caught
without a ticket,

18:12.297 --> 18:13.865
you get kicked off the ride.

18:13.933 --> 18:15.934
That's what I'm saying.
Get 'em on up out of here.

18:17.186 --> 18:19.121
Okay, okay. Settle.

18:19.188 --> 18:20.520
Look, we're out of time,

18:20.588 --> 18:22.389
but we're gonna come back
with these same teams

18:22.457 --> 18:25.292
next class, focusing
on the moral issue,

18:25.360 --> 18:26.993
not just legal precedent.

18:27.061 --> 18:28.061
And, Mr. Hastings,

18:28.129 --> 18:29.896
please try to be on time.

18:31.733 --> 18:32.767
Dre.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.567
Hey.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.234
Hey.

18:35.302 --> 18:36.987
So what happened?

18:38.338 --> 18:39.739
What?

18:43.944 --> 18:45.177
Oh, my God.

18:45.245 --> 18:46.896
Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you.

18:46.964 --> 18:47.881
Can't believe it.

18:47.948 --> 18:49.297
I mean, you studied
your ass off

18:49.366 --> 18:50.632
for that thing.
Are you kidding me?

18:50.700 --> 18:52.284
I know. I'm gonna graduate.

18:52.351 --> 18:53.819
- You know?
- I know.

18:53.887 --> 18:54.853
Oh, my God. Okay.

18:55.005 --> 18:57.272
So let's celebrate tonight,
just me and you.

18:57.340 --> 18:58.490
We have to do something.

18:58.558 --> 19:00.442
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

19:00.510 --> 19:04.478
I told the guys that I was
gonna meet up with them.

19:04.546 --> 19:06.263
- What are you doing, Dre?
- What?

19:06.331 --> 19:08.182
What are you doing?

19:08.249 --> 19:09.166
Keisha, come on.

19:09.234 --> 19:10.467
You're better than all that.

19:10.535 --> 19:11.952
Look at how hard
you're working.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.689
Look at where you're
headed, and look at them.

19:14.756 --> 19:16.557
Okay, those are
my family, okay?

19:16.624 --> 19:18.325
But you're not one of them.

19:18.393 --> 19:19.375
They're all I've got, okay?

19:19.443 --> 19:21.061
No, they're not.

19:21.128 --> 19:24.214
Look, I just don't want to
see you throw your life away

19:24.281 --> 19:25.331
for a bunch of gangbangers

19:25.450 --> 19:27.351
who are so busy watching
their own backs,

19:27.418 --> 19:28.618
they can't even see you.

19:28.686 --> 19:29.869
You know I'm not
throwing away my life.

19:29.937 --> 19:30.903
Look at this, right?

19:30.971 --> 19:33.223
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

19:33.290 --> 19:36.092
Okay, so... so are you
coming tonight?

19:36.159 --> 19:37.643
Keisha, I just told you I...

19:37.710 --> 19:39.862
Andre, you gotta start
making some choices.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.747
You can't keep walking
the middle line,

19:41.815 --> 19:43.298
'cause at some point
you're gonna fall

19:43.366 --> 19:45.233
to one side or the other.

19:45.301 --> 19:47.353
You keep hanging out
with them... Look at me.

19:47.421 --> 19:48.903
You keep hanging out with them,

19:48.971 --> 19:50.905
and one day, you're gonna
get caught in something

19:50.973 --> 19:53.157
that's gonna undo
all that you're doing.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.893
Then it's in God's hands.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.461
I can handle myself, okay?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.230
These guys are from where I'm from.
You know that.

19:59.298 --> 20:00.765
They're not where
you're from, Andre.

20:00.833 --> 20:04.167
They're just where you've been.

20:07.171 --> 20:09.056
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

20:09.123 --> 20:10.557
No, I know.

20:10.624 --> 20:11.608
All right.

20:14.011 --> 20:15.228
Hey, Mussolini.

20:15.296 --> 20:17.030
What's up, flower power?

20:17.098 --> 20:18.031
Nice job today.

20:18.099 --> 20:19.565
If only you were right,

20:19.632 --> 20:21.567
things would have
gone so much better.

20:21.634 --> 20:25.304
Maybe if my teammate wouldn't
have made your point for you.

20:25.371 --> 20:26.906
Eh, he's an idiot.

20:26.973 --> 20:29.641
Oh, he drives me crazy.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.110
Really?

20:31.178 --> 20:33.678
Not like that. Eww.

20:33.746 --> 20:34.946
Are you blushing?

20:35.014 --> 20:36.848
I do not blush.

20:36.916 --> 20:37.949
Oh. That's right.

20:38.017 --> 20:38.917
You a tough girl.

20:38.985 --> 20:41.503
And don't you forget it.

20:41.571 --> 20:44.139
So you coming out tonight?

20:44.207 --> 20:45.673
No, I don't think so.

20:45.741 --> 20:47.476
Um, I got a lot of work to do.

20:47.543 --> 20:49.543
School's almost over.
You should come out,

20:49.611 --> 20:51.278
- have a little fun.
- I can't.

20:51.346 --> 20:54.815
Oh. You're afraid I'm gonna
kick your ass in darts again.

20:54.882 --> 20:57.284
What?! That was me
kicking your ass

20:57.352 --> 20:58.419
in darts last weekend.

20:58.487 --> 21:00.121
That's not how I remember it.

21:00.188 --> 21:01.655
I think you're trying to appeal

21:01.723 --> 21:03.123
to my competitive nature.

21:03.190 --> 21:04.640
Is it working?

21:04.708 --> 21:05.691
A little bit.

21:05.759 --> 21:06.626
All right.

21:06.693 --> 21:08.110
- You did it.
- I did.

21:08.178 --> 21:09.311
You are bold, girl.

21:09.380 --> 21:10.480
When you know what you want,

21:10.547 --> 21:12.081
you just gotta
go for it, right?

21:12.148 --> 21:13.966
Hey, guys.

21:14.034 --> 21:14.884
Hey, Carley. Hi.

21:14.952 --> 21:17.787
Shit. Girl, you got
more books in your arms

21:17.854 --> 21:19.538
than I've read all year.

21:19.605 --> 21:21.823
Carley didn't get the memo
that school's almost out.

21:21.891 --> 21:23.374
If the memo you're talking
about is a degree

21:23.442 --> 21:24.809
that reads summa cum laude,

21:24.877 --> 21:27.146
then, no, I haven't
gotten it. Yet.

21:28.414 --> 21:29.947
Are you still working
on your thesis?

21:30.015 --> 21:30.966
Day and night, yep.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.350
Gotta make daddy proud, right?

21:32.418 --> 21:34.935
No wonder you never get laid.

21:36.121 --> 21:37.754
I am single by choice.

21:37.822 --> 21:41.308
That's her line, and
she's sticking to it.

21:41.610 --> 21:42.693
Oh, is this your show?

21:42.761 --> 21:44.928
Yeah. It's tomorrow,
so you better be there.

21:44.996 --> 21:47.298
No excuses about a
thesis or some bullshit.

21:51.001 --> 21:53.319
That is not true!

22:45.470 --> 22:46.985
What happened?

22:48.855 --> 22:52.458
I never should have gotten
out of bed this morning.

22:53.726 --> 22:55.761
I saw you running out
of the student center.

22:55.828 --> 22:56.762
I...

22:56.829 --> 22:57.763
God.

23:08.057 --> 23:09.690
What's going on?

23:09.758 --> 23:12.160
Michael was in there
with some girl.

23:13.262 --> 23:14.312
Already.

23:17.732 --> 23:20.133
Why didn't you say something?

23:20.201 --> 23:22.168
I...

23:22.236 --> 23:24.655
What... I don't know.

23:25.974 --> 23:30.660
And I'm just
completely paralyzed

23:30.728 --> 23:33.662
by the thought of him
not loving me.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.898
Hey. Come here.

23:56.635 --> 23:58.169
Get your hands up!

23:58.237 --> 23:59.204
Get down!

23:59.438 --> 24:00.988
- Come on, man!
- Get down!

24:01.056 --> 24:02.156
Get off me, man.

24:02.223 --> 24:03.607
I didn't even do anything!

24:03.675 --> 24:06.844
Shut the fuck up.
What is this shit?

24:07.045 --> 24:08.862
What the fuck you think it is?
Books, man.

24:08.930 --> 24:11.148
Fuck I think it is? You
gonna get smart with me?

24:11.216 --> 24:12.500
Shut the fuck up!

24:12.567 --> 24:13.684
You little smartass.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.452
Where you going?

24:15.520 --> 24:16.335
I'm going home, man.

24:16.403 --> 24:17.721
Home? Where you live?

24:17.755 --> 24:19.623
I live up the block, man.
This is bullshit.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.357
I didn't even do anything.
Get off me.

24:21.425 --> 24:24.661
We didn't ask you did you
do something, smartass.

24:24.728 --> 24:26.079
Get the fuck off me, man.

24:27.748 --> 24:29.231
He's clean.

24:29.299 --> 24:31.216
Let his bitch ass up.

24:31.284 --> 24:33.952
Get off the streets, boy.

25:24.534 --> 25:25.935
Yaah!

25:40.366 --> 25:41.399
Where's your mom?

25:41.467 --> 25:42.967
Sleeping.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.236
Where are your manners, boy?

25:46.304 --> 25:47.971
Get out of my way.

25:51.042 --> 25:52.859
Come on, man. She's sleeping.

25:53.945 --> 25:56.046
And what are you gonna do, boy?

25:57.515 --> 25:59.082
You gonna stop me?

25:59.150 --> 26:02.851
Why don't you go out and play
with your little boyfriends.

26:02.919 --> 26:03.953
Heh. Go.

26:25.607 --> 26:27.242
Hi.

26:57.371 --> 26:58.655
What?

27:01.557 --> 27:03.792
Tokyo?

27:03.859 --> 27:07.045
Well, did you tell them that...

27:11.884 --> 27:14.618
Yeah. Everything else
is going really good.

27:16.521 --> 27:20.290
I haven't really talked
to missy in a while, dad.

27:21.726 --> 27:23.928
Dad, um...

27:25.197 --> 27:28.232
It would really mean a
lot to me if there was...

27:28.300 --> 27:31.334
If there was any way that you
could... you would come here,

27:31.402 --> 27:34.037
because, you know, I only
graduate once, and...

27:37.741 --> 27:39.842
Well, law school
is a long way away.

27:42.380 --> 27:44.463
Um...

27:44.530 --> 27:46.648
Dad, you've never
even visited me

27:46.716 --> 27:49.218
this entire time
that I was here,

27:49.286 --> 27:52.288
so, I mean, is this meeting
really that important?

27:59.194 --> 28:00.494
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

28:00.562 --> 28:01.980
No, I totally understand.

28:05.067 --> 28:08.036
Okay. Okay, call me back.

28:24.785 --> 28:27.020
Fuck this.

28:31.591 --> 28:33.993
Max. Hey.

28:34.061 --> 28:38.281
Heh. You feel like getting your
ass kicked at darts again?

28:38.348 --> 28:40.599
It is so on.

28:41.818 --> 28:43.219
No. Nah, nah.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.686
You're gonna have to
rewind it, run that back.

28:45.755 --> 28:47.521
Ain't no way
it went down like that.

28:47.589 --> 28:48.790
Nigger, I ain't bullshitting.

28:48.858 --> 28:51.626
There I was minding
my own fucking business,

28:51.693 --> 28:53.628

28:53.695 --> 28:55.363

28:55.430 --> 28:57.999
Damn, boy, why shit like

28:58.067 --> 28:59.733
'Cause you ain't

28:59.801 --> 29:00.901
Swag. You know it.

29:00.969 --> 29:03.503
- I got swag.
- What... Your girl just a ho.

29:03.571 --> 29:04.838
Yo, what up, wigger?

29:06.241 --> 29:07.791
Yeah, ain't you supposed
to be in school?

29:07.858 --> 29:09.309
School is for pussies.

29:09.377 --> 29:11.729
Why don't you go grab
me a beer or something?

29:11.796 --> 29:13.412
Why don't you go
grab yourself one?

29:13.480 --> 29:15.247
Listen to the little tough man.

29:15.315 --> 29:17.083
Man, why you always
calling me little,

29:17.150 --> 29:19.018

29:19.020 --> 29:20.786
'Cause you look like
you 12 or some shit.

29:20.854 --> 29:22.438
- I'm not a kid.
- Is that right?

29:22.506 --> 29:25.641
Just as tough as any
of you motherfuckers.

29:27.010 --> 29:29.461
Oh, you want to be
a gangster now, huh?

29:29.528 --> 29:32.430
Yeah, y'all just won't let
me in 'cause I'm white.

29:32.498 --> 29:33.781
Hey, that's bullshit.

See, we an equal-opportunity
street crew around here.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.493
Yo, this ain't playtime, man.

This shit here is for real.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.213
Yo, J.J., what about Dre?

29:50.232 --> 29:52.048
Fuck Dre.

Come on, man.

30:37.425 --> 30:38.792

30:38.861 --> 30:41.562
Why don't you go steal us

30:41.629 --> 30:45.098
Yeah. Matter of fact,

30:45.166 --> 30:46.900
why don't you go steal
your daddy's ride?

30:46.967 --> 30:48.802
He's not my fucking daddy.

30:48.869 --> 30:50.820
Look, you ain't got no daddy,

30:50.888 --> 30:52.989

30:53.057 --> 30:55.274

30:55.342 --> 30:56.293
Man, fuck you!

30:56.361 --> 30:59.611
Yo, ease up. Ease the fuck off.

Okay, okay,

not-your-daddy's car then.

31:03.900 --> 31:05.517
And then I'm in?

31:05.585 --> 31:07.753
Patience, kid.

31:07.821 --> 31:09.254
One step at a time, homeboy.

31:09.972 --> 31:11.723
I don't know if I can.

31:11.791 --> 31:13.908
Oh, you so gangster now, you can't
even go get your daddy keys?

31:13.976 --> 31:15.276
I could get 'em!

31:15.344 --> 31:18.329
Get the fuck out of here. Go.

31:19.798 --> 31:21.483
Hey, yo, your boy wilding, bro.

31:21.550 --> 31:25.336
You not gonna let him in

31:25.404 --> 31:26.204
Hell, nah.

31:26.272 --> 31:28.405
Just fucking with
the white boy.

31:29.774 --> 31:31.942
Pow pow!

31:34.545 --> 31:36.563
50 points.

31:41.552 --> 31:42.351
How's she doing?

31:43.837 --> 31:46.438
She really needs
to get to a hospital.

31:47.975 --> 31:49.108
What's your name?

31:53.596 --> 31:54.680
Carley.

31:54.748 --> 31:57.232
Carley, you know where we are?

31:57.300 --> 31:58.483
Yeah.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.238
You want to let us know how
to get out of here, Carley?

32:07.393 --> 32:08.410
I don't know.

32:08.477 --> 32:10.344
What do you mean
you don't know?

32:10.412 --> 32:13.029
You're gonna tell us how to
get the fuck out of here.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.416
Would you shut
the fuck up, Kevin?

32:15.483 --> 32:17.968
Seriously, Carley, we
don't want to get this

32:18.036 --> 32:20.420
any more fucked up than
it already is, do we?

32:20.488 --> 32:22.406
Are you gonna take her
to a hospital?

32:22.474 --> 32:25.175
I need you to tell me
where the highway is.

32:25.243 --> 32:26.676
She really needs
to get to a doctor.

32:26.744 --> 32:28.928
That wasn't my fucking
question, now, was it?

32:29.079 --> 32:31.014
I don't think
that had anything to do

32:31.081 --> 32:32.649
with what you were asking her.

32:42.008 --> 32:44.342
Carley.

32:44.410 --> 32:47.312
Just, um... Just go up here.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.164
If you keep going straight,

32:49.199 --> 32:50.999
the highway's on the left.

32:51.234 --> 32:53.569
You'll see the sign
to the hospital.

32:53.636 --> 32:55.220
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:55.287 --> 32:57.071
What the fuck we listening
to this bitch for?

32:57.139 --> 32:58.672
She don't know shit.

32:58.740 --> 32:59.990
Why you acting like you know

33:00.058 --> 33:01.158
when you don't know shit?

33:01.226 --> 33:03.560
You know, don't you, Carley?

33:03.628 --> 33:06.180
Yeah. It's... It's up here.

33:06.298 --> 33:08.565
You best not be messing
with us, girl.

33:08.633 --> 33:09.399
Thank you.

33:09.467 --> 33:11.517
Thank you very much, Carley.

33:15.339 --> 33:16.505
Yeah.

33:16.573 --> 33:18.224
Dumb bitch.

33:18.292 --> 33:20.576
Man, look for the signs.

33:22.162 --> 33:25.131
Man, I ain't ever
seen any of this shit.

33:28.568 --> 33:31.236
I don't know
where the fuck we are.

33:31.304 --> 33:33.972
I'm supposed to be
at dad's right now.

33:46.869 --> 33:48.068
" ...ball, motherf..."

33:48.136 --> 33:49.304
" Test, motherf..."

33:49.371 --> 33:52.557
" Club up, ah, yeah,
'bout to clown. "

33:52.625 --> 33:54.125
" On the town. "

33:54.192 --> 33:57.644
" Start off at the shot
that came down. "

33:57.711 --> 33:59.212
" I got you up always. "

33:59.280 --> 34:01.081
" I got you crunk always. "

34:01.149 --> 34:02.682
" I got the dance club. "

34:02.750 --> 34:04.234
" Club up all day... "

34:04.252 --> 34:06.870
Man, why they gotta do that?

34:06.937 --> 34:08.004
What?

34:08.072 --> 34:11.556
Cut off the lyrics of the song.

34:11.623 --> 34:14.143
It's the radio.

34:14.210 --> 34:16.161
I know, but...

34:16.228 --> 34:20.616
He chose that word to
express himself, you know.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.451
They shouldn't be able
to do that, man.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.036
They just trying to keep the
track from being heard.

34:26.304 --> 34:29.239
Hey, Kevin, you know what?
Then buy the fucking cd,

34:29.308 --> 34:31.443
and you get all the
self-expression you want.

34:31.510 --> 34:33.344
I will, fool.

34:33.411 --> 34:35.112
Seriously, turn this shit down.

34:35.181 --> 34:37.281
Man, why?

34:37.583 --> 34:38.917
'Cause I'm trying
to fucking think, okay?

34:38.984 --> 34:40.234
You got me in this
fucking situation.

34:40.301 --> 34:41.318
Turn this shit down.

34:41.385 --> 34:43.069
I'm trying to think.

34:45.940 --> 34:49.242
I don't know why I have to tell
you so many fucking times.

34:49.310 --> 34:51.178
I turned it down, all right?

35:13.499 --> 35:14.599
Come on.

35:15.250 --> 35:17.435
I really just want to go home.

35:17.503 --> 35:19.187
You've had the shittiest
day on record.

35:19.255 --> 35:21.206
I'm not gonna let it
end this way.

35:21.274 --> 35:22.340
You need a beer.

35:22.408 --> 35:24.342
Can't believe I wrecked my car.

35:24.410 --> 35:26.343
Oh, you should have
seen the tree.

35:26.411 --> 35:27.861
Come on. Let's go.

35:27.929 --> 35:31.582
He's gonna show up here at
some point with that girl.

35:31.650 --> 35:32.983
Exactly.

35:33.051 --> 35:34.401
This should be fun.

35:36.087 --> 35:37.788
Rach, what are
you talking about?

35:37.856 --> 35:40.073
We're gonna go bust
Mike's next date.

35:40.141 --> 35:41.408
- No, we're not.
- Yes.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.009
- No, we're not.
- Yes. It's payback time.

35:43.077 --> 35:44.327
Please. Please, oh...

35:44.445 --> 35:47.163
You know, I have such a
bad feeling about this.

35:55.588 --> 35:56.789
Shit.

35:56.856 --> 35:58.323
I should have walked.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.195
Fuck this.

36:39.262 --> 36:40.262
Fuck this.

36:42.065 --> 36:43.783
Fuck this.

36:43.850 --> 36:44.917
Dre, what the fuck you doing?

36:44.985 --> 36:46.635
I'm taking her to the hospital.

36:46.703 --> 36:49.372
You're gonna make us go to
prison for the rest of our lives

36:49.439 --> 36:50.806
just so she can go
to the hospital?

36:50.873 --> 36:52.324
I'm not letting her
die in here! You hear me?

36:52.392 --> 36:53.492
She's gonna die anyway, Dre.

36:53.710 --> 36:55.092
Not gonna let her die
in the fucking car!

36:55.160 --> 36:56.745
Well, then let's
fucking dump her.

36:56.812 --> 36:58.630
We'll ice her fucking friend, too.
My God.

36:58.931 --> 37:00.999
Just let us out right here.
I swear to God you won't...

37:01.067 --> 37:02.500
Shut up, bitch!

37:03.219 --> 37:05.353
What the fuck...

37:07.256 --> 37:09.189
What the fuck are you doing?

37:09.257 --> 37:11.208
What the fuck did you do, girl?

37:11.275 --> 37:12.943
What the fuck is this?

37:13.011 --> 37:15.095
What the fuck is this?

37:15.163 --> 37:17.047
- Ah, shit.
- What?

37:17.115 --> 37:18.115
Shit.

37:18.183 --> 37:19.500
Man, what?

37:19.567 --> 37:20.901
It's a cop, man.

37:20.968 --> 37:22.352
Is it?

37:22.420 --> 37:24.603
Oh, motherfucking bitch.

37:24.671 --> 37:25.638
Shit!

37:27.908 --> 37:30.042
Fuck! Oh, shit.

37:30.110 --> 37:31.777
Okay. Shit.

37:31.844 --> 37:33.112
Carley, you fucked up!

37:34.665 --> 37:35.480
You fucked up!

37:35.799 --> 37:37.533
You just gotta floor it, Dre.

37:37.601 --> 37:38.900
Oh, yeah.
That's a fucking good idea,

37:39.002 --> 37:41.303
have a fucking full-on
police chase right now.

37:41.370 --> 37:42.754
You can't get pulled over, man.

37:42.922 --> 37:44.172
Look, we're not being
pulled over right now.

37:44.239 --> 37:45.856
They just behind us,
so calm down.

37:45.924 --> 37:49.344
Don't do anything
else stupid, bitch.

37:49.412 --> 37:50.846
- God.
- I trusted you!

37:50.913 --> 37:53.165
Fuck! Fuck!

37:53.232 --> 37:56.100
I swear to God. Oh, God.

37:56.167 --> 37:58.035
Kevin, stop looking back there.

37:58.103 --> 37:59.787
God.

37:59.855 --> 38:00.921
Shit.

38:00.923 --> 38:03.056
Stop looking back there.

38:03.124 --> 38:05.125
What the fuck
is this cop doing?

38:05.193 --> 38:06.527
He's just creeping on us, man.

38:06.595 --> 38:09.579
Man, he's just
creeping there, Dre.

38:11.082 --> 38:12.748
I'm gonna turn off up here.

38:12.816 --> 38:13.883
Fuck, man.

38:13.951 --> 38:15.902
Moment of truth.

38:24.627 --> 38:26.928
Ah, fuck.

38:49.918 --> 38:51.552
We can still go back.

39:04.315 --> 39:06.616
How the fuck did we get here?

39:06.683 --> 39:07.417
Ray!

39:07.484 --> 39:09.401
Got food stacking up here.

39:09.469 --> 39:10.735
Sorry. Sorry, man.

39:16.593 --> 39:17.676
Ray!

39:19.996 --> 39:21.029
Yeah?

39:23.799 --> 39:25.033
You can go now.

39:25.935 --> 39:27.152
Really?

39:27.219 --> 39:28.919
Yeah.

39:28.987 --> 39:30.605
Thanks, man.

39:30.673 --> 39:32.723
Hey, hey, little man,
little man.

39:33.759 --> 39:35.043
Uh...

39:39.414 --> 39:42.049
So you like this girl, huh?

39:42.116 --> 39:43.883
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

39:45.887 --> 39:47.086
You gonna kiss her?

39:47.154 --> 39:48.655
I don't know, Uncle Duane.

39:48.722 --> 39:50.090
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

39:50.158 --> 39:51.090
I hope so.

39:51.158 --> 39:52.975
You hope so?

39:53.042 --> 39:54.326
Okay. Okay.

39:54.394 --> 39:56.361
You be a gentleman now.

39:56.380 --> 39:58.197
Don't kiss her so hard
you scare her.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.549
Treat her with respect, and
she'll want to kiss you back.

40:00.617 --> 40:01.967
Know what I'm saying?

40:02.035 --> 40:03.853
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.372
All right.

40:09.442 --> 40:11.009
Little man Ray.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.310
Sarah. Ha ha.

40:12.378 --> 40:14.979
Guess I need to call
you big man now, huh?

40:15.047 --> 40:16.148
Yeah.

40:16.215 --> 40:17.682
Go on. Have fun.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.251
Hey, mama.

40:19.318 --> 40:21.253
Go easy on the cologne now.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.369
Gotcha.

40:27.475 --> 40:30.043
I believe he gonna get it.
What you think?

40:30.111 --> 40:31.578
Man, he gonna do it, too.

40:31.646 --> 40:33.179
Look at that white boy.

40:33.247 --> 40:34.715
Hey, Rodger, grab me a beer.

40:34.783 --> 40:36.650
What the fuck I look like,

40:36.718 --> 40:38.468
Geoffrey from the Fresh
Prince or some shit?

40:38.536 --> 40:39.469
Yeah, nigger.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.053
Look, look, you really do.

40:41.121 --> 40:42.222
Little bit, you do.

40:42.289 --> 40:43.423
Get the fuck out.

40:43.490 --> 40:45.841
Yo, what up, Dre?

40:45.909 --> 40:48.061
How was school, dear?

40:48.212 --> 40:49.412
Fuck you, Rodg.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.497
Look. Oreo came to hang
with the niggers.

40:51.565 --> 40:53.131
Why, 'cause I'm the only one

40:53.199 --> 40:54.483
of y'all motherfuckers
getting an education?

40:54.550 --> 40:55.884
Hey, we educating our
motherfucking self

40:55.952 --> 40:56.918
around here, partner.

40:56.986 --> 40:58.020
Oh, yeah, Rodg?

40:58.087 --> 41:00.088
That's... that theory
working for y'all?

41:00.156 --> 41:02.624
Yeah. It's
working out real good.

41:02.691 --> 41:04.759
I got my niggers,
and I got respect.

41:04.827 --> 41:06.495
Think your pussy ass
commanding respect

41:06.562 --> 41:08.562
packing Dr. Seuss
in your book bag?

41:08.630 --> 41:10.514
What, you think
that thing on your waistband

41:10.582 --> 41:12.332
- gives you respect, J.J.?
- Yeah.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.268
This piece gives me power,

41:14.335 --> 41:16.036
and power gets me respect.

41:16.104 --> 41:18.422
Fear and respect are two
different things, brother.

41:19.657 --> 41:21.192
Let me learn you
something, nigger.

41:21.259 --> 41:24.544
You may think you something
special, but you ain't shit.

41:24.611 --> 41:25.812
In the eyes of the world,

41:25.879 --> 41:27.630
there ain't no difference
between you and me.

41:27.698 --> 41:29.782
So no matter what you do,

41:29.850 --> 41:31.000
they ain't gonna
see you as nothin'

41:31.068 --> 41:33.970
but a gangbanger,
homeboy. Believe that.

41:34.037 --> 41:36.388
Hey, y'all got
some beers around here?

41:36.456 --> 41:38.774
Somebody get this pussy-ass
schoolboy a beer.

41:45.098 --> 41:46.765
Hey, where Kevin off to?

41:49.402 --> 41:51.385
Where you got him going, J.J.?

41:51.620 --> 41:54.004
Told him to go steal
his daddy's ride.

41:54.072 --> 41:56.507
You know that's not
his daddy. Come on, man.

41:56.509 --> 41:57.624
Whatever.

41:57.692 --> 41:59.477
So, what? Y'all
letting him in now?

41:59.544 --> 42:00.828
He's gotta do
his initiation, bro.

42:00.896 --> 42:02.680
J.J., I thought
we talked about this.

42:02.748 --> 42:03.881
He's too young.

42:03.949 --> 42:04.749
Man, he's 16.

42:04.817 --> 42:07.267
Yeah, but he's not like us.

42:07.334 --> 42:09.369
Oh, now you and me
alike in some way.

42:09.436 --> 42:11.755
- I just thought we had a deal man.
- Fuck your deal, man.

42:11.822 --> 42:15.308
His big cousin wasn't
here to protect him.

42:15.376 --> 42:17.160
He was off at nursery school,

42:17.227 --> 42:18.811
and here we were.

42:21.481 --> 42:23.014
Hey, let me tear up
that black, nigger.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.351
Hey, didn't you
smoke a cigarette?

42:25.418 --> 42:26.419
Walking cancer-ass nigger.

42:26.486 --> 42:28.420
Fuck you.

42:28.488 --> 42:30.222
Now will you get me a beer?

42:30.290 --> 42:31.874
No, man.

42:41.117 --> 42:43.968
You know, Dre,
I'm getting hungry.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.052
What?

42:45.121 --> 42:46.287
I'm hungry.

42:46.355 --> 42:48.923
How the fuck are you thinking
about food right now?

42:49.158 --> 42:51.024
I don't know. I'm just hungry.

42:51.092 --> 42:54.711
Okay, man, I'm looking for a way for
us to get the fuck out of here.

42:54.779 --> 42:57.848
I told you
to go left back there.

42:57.915 --> 42:59.399
You know, Dre, seriously,
let's find a place.

42:59.467 --> 43:01.168
What the fuck
are you talking about?

43:01.236 --> 43:03.470
I'll get directions.

43:03.538 --> 43:05.005
I'll be in and out real quick.

43:05.072 --> 43:07.139
I'll just get me a
Slushee or something.

43:07.207 --> 43:08.007
A Slushee?

43:08.074 --> 43:10.476
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

43:10.544 --> 43:11.477
That's so nasty.

43:11.545 --> 43:14.880
All right, maybe a corn dog.

43:14.948 --> 43:17.116
Craving a corn dog
I could actually understand.

43:17.184 --> 43:19.819
At least it's got some
food value or something.

43:19.886 --> 43:21.787
What we gotta find's
a place we know.

43:21.821 --> 43:22.854
Yo, pull in up there.

43:22.922 --> 43:24.072
We're not stopping, Kevin.

43:24.140 --> 43:27.108
You don't know where
the fuck we are.

43:27.176 --> 43:28.609
I'll get directions.

43:28.677 --> 43:30.712
Okay, man, if I pull in there,

43:30.780 --> 43:33.114
you gotta be in and out.
That's it,

43:33.182 --> 43:34.282
and just get directions.

43:34.349 --> 43:35.315
All right.

43:35.383 --> 43:37.117
I'm fucking serious, Kevin.

43:37.184 --> 43:38.853
I heard you.

43:38.920 --> 43:40.087
All right.

43:45.143 --> 43:48.645
Hey, yo, pull up closer so I
don't have to walk so far.

43:48.713 --> 43:50.430
Go get directions,
okay, and hurry up.

43:52.683 --> 43:54.317
Hey, you want something?

43:54.385 --> 43:56.152
Just go. Go.

44:27.516 --> 44:28.916
You okay?

44:34.705 --> 44:36.840
You don't have to do this.

44:38.275 --> 44:41.044
You can make this stop.

44:41.111 --> 44:42.111
Nah, I can't.

44:42.179 --> 44:45.148
Yes, you can.

44:45.215 --> 44:47.917
You can. You can just...

44:47.985 --> 44:50.653
just let me take her
to a hospital.

44:50.720 --> 44:51.987
Please.

44:54.424 --> 44:56.292
Look, it's a situation,

44:56.359 --> 44:59.244
but I'm gonna handle it.

45:01.948 --> 45:04.632
You guys are gonna
be okay. Just...

45:04.700 --> 45:06.000
Take care of her, okay?

45:06.067 --> 45:08.920
I can handle it. It'll be fine.

45:08.988 --> 45:11.939
He looks up to you.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.994
I swear to God
if you just let us go,

45:17.062 --> 45:19.980
I won't say anything. You
won't get caught. I promise.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.551
Yeah, why would you do that?

45:24.719 --> 45:26.820
Because...

45:26.938 --> 45:29.606
I think you got
caught in something

45:29.673 --> 45:31.975
that you don't know
how to get out of,

45:32.043 --> 45:35.644
and I think you're just
trying to save your friend.

45:36.947 --> 45:39.398
And I'm just trying
to save mine.

45:41.134 --> 45:43.002
Please don't let her die.

45:43.070 --> 45:45.221
Please don't let her die.

45:50.826 --> 45:52.827
You have some I.D., son?

45:57.483 --> 46:01.336
Well, you're gonna need some I.D.
To buy alcohol.

46:01.404 --> 46:02.871
I'm 21.

46:02.938 --> 46:04.104
Yeah, well,

46:04.172 --> 46:06.440
I'm still gonna need
to see some I.D.

46:06.508 --> 46:07.958
What are you laughing at?

46:08.793 --> 46:11.645
Do you want the rest
of the items?

46:11.712 --> 46:12.946
Son...

46:13.181 --> 46:14.732
I'm not your son.

46:16.067 --> 46:18.235
Just shut up.
Shut the... get out, son.

46:18.303 --> 46:21.103
Son, I can't sell you
beer without proper I.D.

46:21.238 --> 46:23.606
- I'm not your son.
- Do you want...

46:23.673 --> 46:24.523
...some of this, son?
No! Get out!

46:24.591 --> 46:26.275
Stop! Get off her!

46:26.360 --> 46:28.077
What do you think
you're doing? Get... son!

46:28.145 --> 46:29.896
Kevin, get out! You
piece of shit!

46:29.964 --> 46:31.865
You want some of this?
Son, what did I just say?

46:31.932 --> 46:33.865
Get out. This is
not your business.

46:33.933 --> 46:35.900
I'll give you some of this.
Come on!

46:35.968 --> 46:37.669
Put the shit in the bag.

46:37.736 --> 46:39.838
O... okay, son. Just take it easy.

46:39.905 --> 46:41.640
Put the shit in the bag!

46:41.707 --> 46:43.142
Let's take it easy.

46:43.209 --> 46:44.209
Let's take it easy, all right?

46:44.277 --> 46:45.093
Okay. All right.

46:45.161 --> 46:46.361
Look at me!

46:46.429 --> 46:47.963
Kevin, get out. You
piece of shit!

46:48.097 --> 46:48.863
Rodney, get the...

46:48.930 --> 46:50.481
stay the fuck out of here.

46:50.549 --> 46:51.749
Rodney... you, shut up!

46:51.817 --> 46:52.749
Get back here!

46:53.018 --> 46:54.152
Hurry up, old man!

46:54.219 --> 46:56.536
Just leave, okay, son, please.

46:56.604 --> 46:58.622
I'm not your fucking son!

46:58.690 --> 47:00.440
Check your boy out.

47:00.508 --> 47:01.758
He all geeked up,

47:01.827 --> 47:03.459
like fixing to go wild.

47:04.929 --> 47:07.663
He ain't about to do nothin'.

47:07.731 --> 47:08.932
I need a gun.

47:08.999 --> 47:10.800
What the fuck
you gonna do, nigger?

47:10.802 --> 47:11.751
What's going on, Kevin?

47:11.819 --> 47:13.236
I need a gun.

47:15.272 --> 47:18.140
Why don't we
start you off with this.

47:20.977 --> 47:22.427
It'll get the job done.

47:22.495 --> 47:24.429
Kevin. Kevin! Kevin!

47:25.915 --> 47:26.748
Shut the fucking door!

47:26.816 --> 47:28.817
Shut the door! Come on!

47:28.884 --> 47:30.970
Carley, you shut the door!

47:31.037 --> 47:33.054
Get in the car!

47:33.121 --> 47:34.855
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

47:49.553 --> 47:51.088
What happened?

47:54.491 --> 47:55.908
I didn't feel like paying.

47:55.976 --> 47:57.327
You didn't feel like it?

47:58.812 --> 48:00.046
I mean, I was...

48:00.114 --> 48:02.698
So I'm standing there
with all this shit,

48:02.766 --> 48:05.468
and I realize,
fuck, I got a gun,

48:05.535 --> 48:07.135
so I ain't gotta pay.

48:07.203 --> 48:10.155
Did you shoot
the fucking clerk?

48:10.223 --> 48:12.374
Nah.

48:12.442 --> 48:14.025
I just scared him, though.

48:16.947 --> 48:18.579
You want some of these?

48:18.847 --> 48:20.565
No.

48:20.633 --> 48:22.533
I got a 40 in here.

48:25.304 --> 48:27.555
Hey, girl, you want
some of these?

48:33.561 --> 48:38.098
So this guy's all "son"
this and "son" that,

48:38.165 --> 48:40.451
and I ain't
no fucking son of yours.

48:40.518 --> 48:41.602
Anyone else in there?

48:41.669 --> 48:42.553
No.

48:44.973 --> 48:47.623
You are a fucking fool.

48:47.690 --> 48:50.592
Fucking fool! You know that?

48:50.660 --> 48:52.644
I'm sitting there, trying
to pull damage control,

48:52.712 --> 48:55.114
and you'll fuck up, and you
gonna pull some shit like this?

48:55.182 --> 48:57.032
You should have brought us to
the fucking police station

48:57.184 --> 48:59.335
and just fucking
throw cuffs on us.

48:59.402 --> 49:02.821
Dre, it's just
some munchies, man.

49:02.889 --> 49:04.372
You think this is a joke?

49:06.826 --> 49:08.293
That clerk saw you.

49:08.361 --> 49:10.662
He saw your face.
He heard your voice.

49:10.729 --> 49:11.796
He got you on camera.

49:11.864 --> 49:13.431
I bet you he saw
the fucking car.

49:13.566 --> 49:16.000
Now he's gonna call
the fucking cops.

49:16.068 --> 49:18.035
They're gonna be
looking for us.

49:18.103 --> 49:19.920
Then what? You know
what happens then?

49:19.988 --> 49:21.788
You know what happens
if we get caught?

49:21.990 --> 49:23.290
Look behind you.

49:25.127 --> 49:27.128
It's not a fucking joke.

49:28.130 --> 49:29.680
I knew this was a bad idea.

49:29.747 --> 49:31.265
I knew this was
a fucking bad idea.

49:31.332 --> 49:32.549
I'm trying to have your back.

49:34.334 --> 49:36.069
Why couldn't you
just go in there

49:36.137 --> 49:37.203
like a regular
fucking customer,

49:37.271 --> 49:38.421
in and out, that's it?

49:38.488 --> 49:40.090
Just 'cause
you got a fucking gun

49:40.157 --> 49:41.725
doesn't mean you
gotta fucking use it.

49:41.792 --> 49:45.145
We're going away for the rest of our life.
You know that?

49:45.262 --> 49:47.229
Dre, I didn't
kill him or nothing.

49:47.296 --> 49:49.098
Well, you should have
fucking killed him.

49:49.165 --> 49:50.699
You should have fucking
finished the job,

49:50.701 --> 49:52.400
finished it like a man.

49:58.291 --> 50:00.209
Dre, we cool. It's...

50:00.276 --> 50:03.194
We're not fucking cool,
Kevin! Are you serious?!

50:07.265 --> 50:09.466
We gotta ditch the car.

50:10.302 --> 50:12.353
It's okay, man. I mean,

50:12.420 --> 50:15.155
we'll tell J.J., a... and
he'll have to let me in,

50:15.223 --> 50:16.023
and it's gonna be okay.

50:16.090 --> 50:17.440
Shut the fuck up, okay.

50:17.508 --> 50:19.242
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

50:20.711 --> 50:21.944
Dre, I'm sorry.

50:22.012 --> 50:24.280
I'm done
hearing you talk, Kevin.

50:27.851 --> 50:29.102
Potty training's over.

50:29.169 --> 50:31.369
I'm not your fucking
friend right now.

50:32.839 --> 50:34.706
- Hey, hold up.
- I'm not gonna take it anymore.

50:34.774 --> 50:36.508
- What happened?
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.

50:36.575 --> 50:37.777
Come on, man.

50:37.844 --> 50:40.445
No, Dre, I'm gonna put a
bullet in his fucking head.

50:40.513 --> 50:41.163
Hey! What?

50:42.882 --> 50:45.451
It ain't worth it, man, okay?

50:45.518 --> 50:46.717
What do you know?

50:46.785 --> 50:48.753
I know you're gonna go to jail

50:48.821 --> 50:50.104
for the rest
of your life, okay,

50:50.172 --> 50:52.339
over some asshole your
mom brought home, okay?

50:52.458 --> 50:54.358
Let's think about it
for a second.

50:56.394 --> 50:59.263
Can you just
take a walk with me?

51:00.749 --> 51:02.732
Kevin, take a walk with me.

51:04.535 --> 51:05.735
You trust me, right?

51:09.640 --> 51:11.842
Yeah, all right.

51:11.909 --> 51:13.343
Let's do this.

52:18.254 --> 52:20.488
I don't know about this whole
"winner buys the drinks" thing.

52:20.556 --> 52:22.273
Well, it's the least
you two can do

52:22.341 --> 52:24.209
after making me look
like a chump over there.

52:24.276 --> 52:25.811
It's all in the wrist, baby.

52:25.878 --> 52:26.812
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

52:26.879 --> 52:29.047
Whoa. Tequila shots already?

52:29.115 --> 52:31.031
Mm. I like to think of these

52:31.099 --> 52:33.033
as little shots of courage.

52:33.101 --> 52:34.251
Courage for what?

52:34.318 --> 52:36.103
Nothing. We're
aborting the mission.

52:36.105 --> 52:38.105
Oh, I think someone
needs another shot.

52:38.173 --> 52:40.475
Um, Michael has
a date here tonight.

52:40.542 --> 52:43.043
- What?
- I thought you two were still together.

52:43.111 --> 52:44.761
- Yeah, me, too.
- What an asshole.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.078
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

52:46.146 --> 52:47.146
Speak of the devil.

52:47.214 --> 52:49.749
Is that the girl?

52:49.817 --> 52:51.718
Yeah.

52:51.785 --> 52:53.053
He's such an ass.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.570
Are you okay?

52:54.638 --> 52:56.105
Yeah.

52:56.173 --> 52:57.958
Can we just go?

52:58.025 --> 53:00.359
No. No, you have
to say something.

53:00.426 --> 53:01.610
Seriously,
now's the time. Go on.

53:01.678 --> 53:03.762
Taking the reins
of life, baby. I love it.

53:03.830 --> 53:07.049
- So does that mean he's single now?
- Jill.

53:07.051 --> 53:08.067
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

53:08.134 --> 53:09.451
Seriously, I'm kidding.

53:09.519 --> 53:10.952
Well, I'm gonna go see if
I can find some sucker

53:11.020 --> 53:12.554
to try to take me on in darts.

53:12.622 --> 53:13.438
I'll take that challenge.

53:13.506 --> 53:14.906
Rach, I'm kind of ready to go.

53:14.974 --> 53:16.107
Oh, you can't go.

53:16.375 --> 53:17.342
The night's just
getting started.

53:17.492 --> 53:18.692
Yeah, and... and I'm driving,

53:18.760 --> 53:20.261
so if I'm staying,
you're staying.

53:20.329 --> 53:22.346
My God. I wrecked my car.
Please just have some mercy.

53:22.414 --> 53:24.265
You wrecked your car?

53:24.332 --> 53:25.983
It's been a long day.

53:26.051 --> 53:27.218
Well, I can take you home.

53:27.285 --> 53:28.602
Really?

53:28.670 --> 53:31.254
Yeah. No, I think I've squeezed

53:31.322 --> 53:33.006
all the fun I can
out of this place.

53:33.074 --> 53:34.024
- No. Stay.
- No...

53:34.092 --> 53:35.775
No, I'm taking the reins, baby.

53:35.843 --> 53:36.927
Touché.

53:36.995 --> 53:38.294
All right,
well, go easy on him.

53:38.362 --> 53:40.113
He's already had his ass
handed to him once tonight.

53:40.180 --> 53:41.264
I'll see you at home?

53:41.332 --> 53:42.899
Yeah. You have your keys?

53:42.967 --> 53:44.000
Yes. I think.

53:44.268 --> 53:45.868
Bye, guys.

53:45.936 --> 53:47.219
Have a good night. Bye.

54:03.952 --> 54:06.588
Oh, Jesus, help me, please.

54:08.106 --> 54:09.573
It's okay.

54:11.410 --> 54:12.843
You're gonna be okay.

54:12.911 --> 54:14.778
I want to go home.

54:22.803 --> 54:24.137
Oh, God.

54:24.205 --> 54:25.405
Gonna be all right.

54:25.473 --> 54:27.791
Please, help me.

54:27.859 --> 54:29.892
Please help me.

54:30.944 --> 54:31.877
" Open up the shells. "

54:31.945 --> 54:33.329
" Put your 5-o out. "

54:33.397 --> 54:35.031
" No mercy, no pleas, "

54:35.098 --> 54:36.499
" let my trigger finger
squeeze. "

54:36.567 --> 54:38.033
" My money's on my mind, "

54:38.101 --> 54:39.768
" and I'll pay
to make you bleed, "

54:39.836 --> 54:40.736
" 'cause I sneak a... "

54:44.023 --> 54:45.574
Shh. Shh.

55:00.321 --> 55:01.889
Hey. Hey.

55:05.927 --> 55:06.927
Shh.

55:06.995 --> 55:08.662
Oh, God.

55:16.636 --> 55:18.504
Are you okay?

55:20.390 --> 55:22.675
Hey. Hey, wake up.

55:24.644 --> 55:25.912
Hey. Hey.

55:28.881 --> 55:30.248
Shh.

55:32.952 --> 55:34.586
Shit.

56:27.136 --> 56:28.636
What are you doing?

56:30.856 --> 56:32.757
I gotta think.

56:40.900 --> 56:42.066
Shit.

57:04.121 --> 57:06.055
You want to have sex?

57:07.557 --> 57:08.891
No.

57:13.996 --> 57:16.698
Take your pants off.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.667
No. No. No.

57:18.734 --> 57:21.786
I'm not fucking around, girl!

57:28.376 --> 57:29.643
Come on!

57:29.710 --> 57:31.044
O... okay.

57:31.112 --> 57:32.146
Please don't do this.

57:32.213 --> 57:33.914
Please don't do this.

57:41.189 --> 57:42.388
Please don't do this.

57:42.455 --> 57:43.722
Now, bitch.

57:47.861 --> 57:50.746
I cannot wait
for this day to be over.

57:50.814 --> 57:51.747
I hear you.

57:53.016 --> 57:56.169
Oh, shit, I forgot my credit
card back at the bar.

57:56.236 --> 57:57.169
I'll wait here.

57:57.236 --> 57:58.503
I'll be right back.

58:18.440 --> 58:20.791
Where the fuck are we?

58:20.859 --> 58:21.575
By the college.

58:21.643 --> 58:23.861
What are we doing over here?

58:24.796 --> 58:27.563
Come on, man. I'll show you.

58:27.631 --> 58:30.267
It's a good place
right up here.

58:30.367 --> 58:32.468
I'm hungry.

58:32.536 --> 58:34.938
It'll be a'ight.

58:35.006 --> 58:35.638
Hey.

58:35.706 --> 58:36.539
Got it?

58:36.606 --> 58:39.092
Yep. Let's get out of here.

58:42.561 --> 58:45.413
Hey, thanks for
rescuing me back there.

58:45.481 --> 58:47.399
No problem.

58:47.466 --> 58:49.902
You sure you're okay?

58:49.969 --> 58:51.720
Heh.

58:51.787 --> 58:52.988
Yeah.

58:55.158 --> 58:56.458
You been here before?

58:56.526 --> 58:59.160
Yeah, man, a few times.

59:00.896 --> 59:03.564
I mean, I know it's
for the best, so...

59:03.632 --> 59:06.133
You deserve a lot better,
seriously.

59:06.168 --> 59:08.869
I just can't believe
it took me so long.

59:10.589 --> 59:12.355
- Hey, Dre...
- Hmm?

59:12.423 --> 59:13.824
You ever kill someone?

59:13.891 --> 59:14.825
Hell, no.

59:14.892 --> 59:16.860
Come on, man. You know
better than that.

59:17.895 --> 59:20.314
Can you believe we're
about to graduate?

59:20.464 --> 59:21.514
God, I know.

59:21.582 --> 59:23.699
You're going
to law school, right?

59:23.767 --> 59:26.969
Yeah, that's the plan.

59:27.037 --> 59:29.704
You don't sound
too stoked about that.

59:31.524 --> 59:35.710
I was, but I don't know.
People tell you

59:35.896 --> 59:38.664
your whole life you're gonna
be this certain thing,

59:38.731 --> 59:43.251
and then somehow you just
one day end up becoming it.

59:43.319 --> 59:45.003
J.J.'S killed lots of people.

59:45.070 --> 59:47.722
Yeah, well, J.J.'S out of his damn mind.
You know that.

59:47.790 --> 59:49.991
He's a real fucking gangster.

59:50.058 --> 59:51.509
Yes, he is.

59:52.811 --> 59:54.946
Hey, about J.J.
And those guys...

59:55.014 --> 59:56.079
Yeah?

59:56.147 --> 59:57.080
You joining, man?

59:57.148 --> 59:59.850
J.J. Said if
I steal a car, I'm in.

01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:01.835
It's about fucking time, too.

01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:04.605
I don't know why they
didn't let me in before.

01:00:04.673 --> 01:00:06.406
Kev, they didn't
let you in before

01:00:06.474 --> 01:00:08.208
'cause I asked them not to.

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.526
What?

01:00:09.593 --> 01:00:11.677
I didn't want to see you
get caught up

01:00:11.744 --> 01:00:13.562
in something that you
have no idea about.

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:16.048
So you don't want
to be a lawyer?

01:00:18.618 --> 01:00:19.785
I don't know.

01:00:20.637 --> 01:00:22.355
In a way, I guess I've never

01:00:22.422 --> 01:00:23.555
really thought about it before.

01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.491
Why would you do
something like that?

01:00:25.559 --> 01:00:28.427
I was just trying to
protect you. That's it.

01:00:28.494 --> 01:00:30.195
You're not
my fucking daddy, Dre!

01:00:30.263 --> 01:00:32.314
Yeah, I know that, but I'm
the closest thing you got

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:34.149
to family, okay?

01:00:34.217 --> 01:00:35.533
Man, fuck you!

01:00:35.601 --> 01:00:37.452
All I was trying to do
was protect you.

01:00:37.519 --> 01:00:38.537
Yeah? Protect me from what?

01:00:38.604 --> 01:00:39.704
From... from what? From all this.

01:00:39.772 --> 01:00:40.737
From everything. From yourself.

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:42.039
Fuck this! This is bullshit!

01:00:42.107 --> 01:00:44.140
Come on. Kevin! Kevin, hold on!

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.960
Well, what would you do?

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:53.334
I would just pack up
my car and just go.

01:00:53.401 --> 01:00:55.901
Where would you go?

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:57.603
Anywhere.

01:00:58.973 --> 01:01:00.823
Come on! Hurry up, girl.

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:06.095
Please don't do this.

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:10.016
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.885
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the gun!

01:01:13.903 --> 01:01:14.886
A'ight!

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.306
Everybody out!

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.942
Everybody out.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:22.911
What are you doing?

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:25.130
I know what I got to do now.

01:01:25.197 --> 01:01:26.280
I'm finishing it.

01:01:30.285 --> 01:01:31.135
Get out!

01:01:31.203 --> 01:01:32.286
Dre, wait up!

01:01:32.354 --> 01:01:33.954
Hold up!

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:37.575
This is you.
This is you, Kevin.

01:01:47.618 --> 01:01:50.053
You next to her.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.155
Dre, don't do this, please.

01:01:53.424 --> 01:01:55.691
What'd you call me?

01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.778
Shit.

01:01:59.846 --> 01:02:01.463
Get down next to her!

01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:03.733
Next to her on your knees!

01:02:05.435 --> 01:02:07.636
What are you gonna do, Dre?

01:02:07.704 --> 01:02:09.104
We're finishing it.

01:02:09.172 --> 01:02:11.956
We're gonna finish
what you started.

01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:18.729
Face the wall!

01:02:18.964 --> 01:02:20.364
Put your face against the wall.

01:02:20.432 --> 01:02:21.733
Face up against the wall.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:22.867
Please don't do this.

01:02:22.935 --> 01:02:25.068
Turn your face to the wall!

01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:37.314
Okay.

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.898
Ah, jeez.

01:02:46.657 --> 01:02:48.558
Can I do it?

01:02:48.625 --> 01:02:50.493
What?

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:57.048
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.069
You think this is fun?

01:03:03.539 --> 01:03:05.940
You think this
is some gangster shit?

01:03:07.677 --> 01:03:09.893
You want to shoot somebody?

01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:11.945
I should fucking shoot you!

01:03:12.013 --> 01:03:13.914
Come on, Dre. Chill out.

01:03:13.982 --> 01:03:15.866
"Chill out!" "Chill out!"

01:03:15.967 --> 01:03:17.818
I worked my whole life...

01:03:17.885 --> 01:03:21.522
My whole life
to not be like this,

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.490
for you not to get like this!

01:03:24.558 --> 01:03:25.525
Look at us now,

01:03:25.592 --> 01:03:27.944
exactly what
they thought we'd be!

01:03:28.011 --> 01:03:30.179
Kevin, what do you think's
gonna happen after this?

01:03:30.247 --> 01:03:32.815
Look at these girls!
Look at them. Look at us.

01:03:32.883 --> 01:03:35.317
It's over.
It's all fucking over.

01:03:35.385 --> 01:03:39.020
I got a gun in my hand 'cause I
don't see any other way out!

01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:42.840
It's all right, man.

01:03:42.908 --> 01:03:46.311
If we kill 'em, no
one'll know it was us.

01:03:48.131 --> 01:03:49.798
Ah, Kevin...

01:03:54.236 --> 01:03:55.702
We'll know.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:03.860
I'm outta here.

01:04:03.928 --> 01:04:05.579
I'm getting outta here.

01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:07.164
Where the fuck are you going?

01:04:07.232 --> 01:04:08.432
Just go. No.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.566
Just go.

01:04:10.634 --> 01:04:12.435
I can't leave you here.

01:04:14.689 --> 01:04:16.756
Okay. Okay, just stay here.

01:04:16.824 --> 01:04:18.091
I'll be right back.

01:04:20.945 --> 01:04:22.162
Where the fuck you going?

01:04:22.229 --> 01:04:23.762
You can't leave!

01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:25.730
They'll go to the cops! Shit.

01:04:25.798 --> 01:04:27.416
Hey, girl!

01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:29.117
- This is bullshit!
- You're not hearing what I'm trying

01:04:29.185 --> 01:04:30.652
- to say to you, okay?
- Just shut up!

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.854
Stop for a second.
Listen to me.

01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:33.355
Get away from me!

01:04:33.423 --> 01:04:34.956
You're not hearing what
I'm trying to say to you.

01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:36.658
Stop. Listen to me
for a second.

01:04:36.726 --> 01:04:38.676
Kevin, you don't understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:41.028
I... I was just trying to
protect you, that's it. Okay?

01:04:41.096 --> 01:04:42.847
I'm gonna Jack
this car right here.

01:04:42.915 --> 01:04:43.915
Kevin, what are you doing?

01:04:43.983 --> 01:04:45.767
I'm gonna do
my initiation right now!

01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:46.934
Kevin, come on.

01:04:47.002 --> 01:04:49.403
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:51.706
Kevin, come on! Kevin!

01:04:51.773 --> 01:04:53.740
Let's get out of here, okay?

01:04:53.808 --> 01:04:54.925
- God.
- Kevin, stop!

01:04:54.993 --> 01:04:57.143
Kevin, get off the car!

01:04:57.211 --> 01:04:59.412
- You know there's an alarm on that car!
- Let's...

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.547
man, fuck that shit!

01:05:03.334 --> 01:05:05.652
Oh, my God.

01:05:06.854 --> 01:05:09.171
Give me the keys, bitch!

01:05:09.239 --> 01:05:11.006
- Kevin, stop, okay?
- Give me the keys!

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.042
- Kevin, put the gun down!
- Shut up!

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.860
Let's just go, Kevin!
What are you doing?

01:05:14.878 --> 01:05:15.962
- Shut up!
- Kevin!

01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:17.796
Purse! Give me your purse!

01:05:17.864 --> 01:05:19.965
Get in the fucking car!

01:05:20.033 --> 01:05:21.500
Get in the car!

01:05:21.568 --> 01:05:22.718
Kevin, what are you doing?

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:24.052
- Get in the fucking car!
- Kevin, put it down.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.654
Get in the car!
Get in the fucking car!

01:05:25.804 --> 01:05:27.171
- Take whatever you want. Please.
- Drive.

01:05:27.239 --> 01:05:29.273
Take it. Take it.
Just don't hit me.

01:05:29.275 --> 01:05:30.825
- Get in the car!
- Just don't do this.

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:31.959
Kevin! Please don't do this!

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.094
Come on.
Get in the fucking car.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:34.211
Please, please don't do this.

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:35.379
Shut the fuck up!

01:05:35.481 --> 01:05:36.631
- Take whatever you want.
- Shit.

01:05:36.698 --> 01:05:38.131
Get in! Let's go! Come on.

01:05:38.199 --> 01:05:40.717
Get in the car! Shut up!

01:05:40.785 --> 01:05:42.019
- Please!
- Kevin, what are you doing?

01:05:42.186 --> 01:05:43.720
- Now!
- Kevin, put the gun down!

01:05:43.788 --> 01:05:44.988
Shut the fuck up!

01:05:45.056 --> 01:05:47.157
- Kevin!
- Please don't... help!

01:05:47.375 --> 01:05:49.410
- Kevin, stop!
- Get in the fucking car!

01:05:49.477 --> 01:05:51.528
Help!

01:05:51.596 --> 01:05:53.062
No!

01:05:58.602 --> 01:06:00.119
What the fuck
did you do, Kevin?

01:06:00.187 --> 01:06:01.804
What the fuck did you do?

01:06:01.872 --> 01:06:05.107
Get in the car! Get in the car!

01:06:05.175 --> 01:06:06.242
Oh, shit.

01:06:11.948 --> 01:06:13.799
Shit.

01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:16.117
Fuck.

01:06:37.288 --> 01:06:38.371
Come on, man.

01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:39.939
Dre...

01:06:42.576 --> 01:06:45.044
You know I had to do it.

01:06:45.112 --> 01:06:47.630
Let's just get out of here.

01:06:47.698 --> 01:06:49.666
Let's go find J.J., man.

01:06:49.733 --> 01:06:51.417
You hear me?

01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:54.686
You have any idea
what's going on?

01:06:54.754 --> 01:06:56.889
You don't tell J.J. Anything.

01:06:56.956 --> 01:06:58.957
Nothing, you hear me?

01:07:00.459 --> 01:07:03.294
This is really bad.
You know that?

01:07:03.362 --> 01:07:05.180
Really fucking bad right now.

01:07:37.693 --> 01:07:39.378
Kevin...

01:07:40.731 --> 01:07:43.132
That place
I took you to today...

01:07:45.869 --> 01:07:48.003
That's some place I go to...

01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:54.458
I wanted to show you
that there's... there's...

01:07:57.546 --> 01:08:00.381
There's... there's a place
you can escape.

01:08:05.538 --> 01:08:11.191
Hey, listen, just don't say anything
to anybody about tonight, okay?

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:13.159
It's a different world.

01:08:13.227 --> 01:08:15.546
Those girls aren't
from this world.

01:08:17.348 --> 01:08:20.517
We're in a lot of trouble.
You know that?

01:08:24.087 --> 01:08:25.220
Go home, Kevin.

01:08:25.287 --> 01:08:26.923
Go home.

01:08:28.291 --> 01:08:31.426
And don't say anything
to anyone. You hear me?

01:08:36.698 --> 01:08:38.533
It's in God's hands now.

01:08:57.502 --> 01:09:01.488
Help! Help me! Help me!
I need help!

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.790
Help!

01:09:03.858 --> 01:09:07.859
Please, I need help! Please!

01:09:11.198 --> 01:09:12.532
Oh, my God.

01:09:12.599 --> 01:09:13.800
Oh, my God.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.337
Hello. Help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

01:09:23.142 --> 01:09:25.176
No! No! No!

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:25.978
No!

01:09:26.045 --> 01:09:27.694
No, no.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:29.497
No, no, no.

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:30.497
Oh, my God.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:31.299
Please.

01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:35.319
Please, somebody help me!

01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:36.670
Please!

01:09:40.575 --> 01:09:41.508
Oh, my God.

01:09:43.111 --> 01:09:45.612
Help me! Please!

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.799
Somebody help me!

01:09:52.737 --> 01:09:54.671
Holy shit.

01:09:54.738 --> 01:09:57.140
W-what happened to you?

01:09:58.125 --> 01:09:59.375
What happened?

01:09:59.443 --> 01:10:01.644
Come on. Come on. Get... get in.

01:10:01.712 --> 01:10:02.846
L.. let me help you.

01:10:02.914 --> 01:10:04.580
Come on. Come on.

01:10:04.648 --> 01:10:06.348
Get in, lady.

01:10:06.416 --> 01:10:07.800
Come on, lady. Let me help you.

01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:10.536
Come on. Let me help.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.575
What happened?

01:10:16.642 --> 01:10:19.328
They shot me.

01:10:22.397 --> 01:10:24.115
What's your name, sweetie?

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.133
Where are you taking me?

01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:28.169
There's a hospital nearby.

01:10:28.236 --> 01:10:29.370
They'll take care of you.

01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:31.639
W... what's your name?

01:10:31.707 --> 01:10:33.391
Carley.

01:10:33.459 --> 01:10:34.991
All right.

01:10:35.059 --> 01:10:37.811
Oh, my God. Lena.

01:10:37.878 --> 01:10:39.479
What happened? What happened?
Who's Lena?

01:10:39.547 --> 01:10:41.264
They took her to the tunnel,
and then she's just...

01:10:41.432 --> 01:10:43.216
She's waiting there.
We have to go back.

01:10:43.284 --> 01:10:44.050
We have to go back!

01:10:44.118 --> 01:10:45.652
No. We... we cannot go back!

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.404
When we get to
the hospital, we'll...

01:10:47.472 --> 01:10:48.622
No, no, she...

01:10:48.690 --> 01:10:50.489
No, we'll send someone
to go find her. You...

01:10:50.557 --> 01:10:52.858
we got to get you taken
care of, all right?

01:10:52.926 --> 01:10:54.377
Carley, can you hear me?

01:10:56.713 --> 01:10:58.930
Carley?

01:10:59.199 --> 01:11:01.484
She graduates in two weeks.

01:11:01.551 --> 01:11:05.303
She's probably just waiting
there like I told her.

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:09.808
I promise we'll go back
to find her, all right?

01:11:09.876 --> 01:11:10.809
We'll find your friend.

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:14.061
Look, h...hold this up
for me, sweetie.

01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.330
Hold that... hold that up.

01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:18.399
Okay. That's it.

01:11:20.701 --> 01:11:22.219
Carley, stay with me.
Stay with me.

01:11:22.286 --> 01:11:23.821
Look at me, Carley. Carley!

01:11:25.306 --> 01:11:26.840
Somebody's been shot!

01:11:26.907 --> 01:11:28.391
Help!

01:11:33.681 --> 01:11:35.814
That's it. That's it now.

01:11:35.882 --> 01:11:36.782
It's all right.

01:11:39.219 --> 01:11:40.819
Okay, come on.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:46.659
Somebody's been shot!

01:11:46.727 --> 01:11:48.494
Hurry up!

01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:49.761
Somebody come!

01:11:51.264 --> 01:11:52.881
All right,
what have we got here?

01:11:52.949 --> 01:11:54.449
- She was shot in the head.
- Lay your head down, ma'am.

01:11:54.517 --> 01:11:56.751
- I don't know how many times.
- Who are you?

01:11:56.819 --> 01:11:58.203
I found her in the streets.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:59.337
She... she was
wandering the streets.

01:11:59.505 --> 01:12:00.438
What's your name, honey?

01:12:00.506 --> 01:12:01.322
Carley Mitchell.

01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:03.108
She had a friend with her.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.342
She's in the tunnel.
She said she was in a tunnel.

01:12:04.476 --> 01:12:05.392
All right. You know what, sir?

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.543
We can take it from here.

01:12:06.762 --> 01:12:08.211
- What?
- No, no, no, go with me.

01:12:08.279 --> 01:12:09.564
- I'm... I...
- Please don't...

01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:11.114
Carley. Don't leave me!

01:12:11.132 --> 01:12:12.616
I'll be right here!
I'll be right here!

01:12:12.684 --> 01:12:14.018
I'm sure the police
want to speak with you.

01:12:14.086 --> 01:12:14.985
No! Carley!

01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.019
I'll be right here!

01:12:16.087 --> 01:12:18.339
I ain't going nowhere.

01:12:42.512 --> 01:12:44.930
Where exactly was she
when you found her?

01:12:44.932 --> 01:12:49.683
I saw her wandering on Jett
not far from the tracks.

01:12:49.751 --> 01:12:52.420
She give you any details
about what happened?

01:12:52.487 --> 01:12:57.324
Nah. Well, it seemed like,
uh, they were in her car,

01:12:57.392 --> 01:13:00.995
and, um, she said
her friend was with her,

01:13:01.063 --> 01:13:04.180
and they left her
in... in a tunnel.

01:13:04.248 --> 01:13:06.616
She tell you anything
about who they were?

01:13:06.684 --> 01:13:07.768
Nah.

01:13:07.835 --> 01:13:09.803
You didn't ask?

01:13:09.871 --> 01:13:13.072
Well, I was kind of focused on
getting her to the hospital.

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.541
She'd been shot in the head.

01:13:14.609 --> 01:13:16.893
Where were you going when
you encountered the victim?

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.794
What?

01:13:18.796 --> 01:13:22.214
This receipt has the girl
leaving a bar called the tavern

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:25.400
approximately 96 minutes
before she was admitted.

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:27.369
Were you anywhere
within that vicinity?

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:33.675
No. I told you I saw her
running in the street.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:34.842
Where were you going?

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:37.012
I was headed home.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.513
Where's that?

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.448
I live on Elizabeth Avenue.

01:13:40.515 --> 01:13:42.383
Where were you coming from?

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.287
I have a restaurant.

01:13:46.322 --> 01:13:48.288
I run a barbecue place
in the neighborhood.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.489
I was coming from there.

01:13:49.557 --> 01:13:50.557
Anybody see you there?

01:13:50.624 --> 01:13:51.859
What kind
of a question is that?

01:13:51.926 --> 01:13:53.227
- What you mean...
- Just answer the question, sir,

01:13:53.294 --> 01:13:54.461
or we can do this
down at the station.

01:13:54.529 --> 01:13:55.795
My customers. My
customers saw me there.

01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:57.564
- You know any of their names?
- What, all of them?

01:13:57.631 --> 01:14:00.100
Does anybody work with you?

01:14:00.168 --> 01:14:01.668
My nephew,

01:14:01.736 --> 01:14:04.269
but he left early, so I closed.

01:14:05.655 --> 01:14:08.590
We're gonna need his name
and contact information.

01:14:18.283 --> 01:14:20.985
Heh. Shit.

01:14:30.879 --> 01:14:32.763
We'll be in touch.

01:16:16.695 --> 01:16:21.381
Dr. Bradley, 2744.

01:16:21.449 --> 01:16:25.368
Dr. Bradley, 2744.

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:35.945
Hey, little man.

01:16:35.947 --> 01:16:39.281
Ray? Yeah, it's me.

01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:40.850
Oh, uh...

01:16:40.917 --> 01:16:44.019
I didn't mean to bother
you on your date.

01:16:45.439 --> 01:16:48.706
It's almost curfew.
You know that, right?

01:16:52.895 --> 01:16:54.328
Nah, nah.

01:16:54.396 --> 01:16:56.297
I'm not home yet. Uh...

01:16:56.365 --> 01:16:58.015
Just running a little late.

01:17:00.536 --> 01:17:04.254
Nah. Uh, just, uh...

01:17:04.322 --> 01:17:06.106
just helping a friend.

01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:11.177
Yeah, okay, no.
I was just checking in.

01:17:13.014 --> 01:17:14.731
You get home safe, okay?

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.718
Yeah, all right.

01:17:18.785 --> 01:17:19.836
Ray?

01:17:22.222 --> 01:17:23.823
Um...

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:33.097
You're my heart.

01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:36.801
You know that, right?

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.040
Yeah.

01:17:45.011 --> 01:17:46.276
Yeah, okay.

01:17:46.344 --> 01:17:48.111
Yeah, you...

01:17:48.179 --> 01:17:50.981
you be safe, all right?

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:54.018
All right, yeah. Okay.
All right, bye. Yeah.

01:17:57.889 --> 01:18:00.124
Dr. Gateau to the pharmacy.

01:18:00.192 --> 01:18:03.376
Dr. Gateau to the pharmacy.

01:19:32.544 --> 01:19:34.744
Hi.

01:19:36.914 --> 01:19:38.549
Hey.

01:19:43.187 --> 01:19:45.254
I'm... I'm Duane.

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:46.489
I... I brought you here.

01:19:46.557 --> 01:19:49.892
Where's Lena?

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.594
Um...

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:53.596
Hey, you... you might want to...

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:55.598
No, no. Lay back. Come on.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.800
Is she okay?

01:19:57.835 --> 01:20:00.135
Look, y... you got really lucky.

01:20:00.203 --> 01:20:02.637
They say the bullets
shattered in your skull,

01:20:02.705 --> 01:20:04.606
d.. didn't even
get to your brain, so...

01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:05.941
Where's Lena?

01:20:08.711 --> 01:20:11.746
They found her in the
tunnel, like you said.

01:20:13.916 --> 01:20:15.749
She didn't make it.

01:20:18.536 --> 01:20:20.671
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:20:22.474 --> 01:20:25.593
No. No, she was... she was okay.

01:20:27.412 --> 01:20:28.295
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:20:28.363 --> 01:20:30.480
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:20:30.547 --> 01:20:32.148
Oh, my God!

01:20:32.215 --> 01:20:33.650
I left her there!

01:20:33.717 --> 01:20:35.217
- I left...
- A.. all right...

01:20:35.286 --> 01:20:37.320
Oh, my God!

01:20:37.388 --> 01:20:40.106
No! No!

01:20:40.174 --> 01:20:42.224
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:20:42.293 --> 01:20:43.793
Oh, no!

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:46.311
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:20:46.379 --> 01:20:48.379
No! God!

01:20:48.447 --> 01:20:49.798
All right.

01:20:53.085 --> 01:20:55.854
All right, all right,
I... I got you. I got you.

01:20:55.921 --> 01:20:58.106
I got you. I got you.

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.146
Let's go, Riggs.

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.268
Hands on the wall.

01:22:19.215 --> 01:22:20.015
Okay.

01:22:21.685 --> 01:22:22.835
Inmate name?

01:22:22.903 --> 01:22:23.869
Um...

01:22:23.937 --> 01:22:26.405
Who are you here to see, honey?

01:22:26.472 --> 01:22:28.107
Andre Riggs.

01:22:42.688 --> 01:22:44.822
Down the hall.
Through the doors.

01:23:19.172 --> 01:23:21.039
Hi.

01:23:22.441 --> 01:23:24.042
Hi.

01:23:26.796 --> 01:23:28.796
I heard about your cousin.

01:23:30.365 --> 01:23:34.067
They sent me a letter
to tell me that he died.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:38.505
Yeah, it happened
in the yard. He, um...

01:23:38.574 --> 01:23:40.975
he got what was coming to him.

01:23:42.477 --> 01:23:44.227
I'm leaving Georgia,

01:23:44.294 --> 01:23:47.214
but they want me to
put a statement on file

01:23:47.281 --> 01:23:49.849
for when you're up for parole.

01:23:49.917 --> 01:23:53.052
So, um...

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.923
I have to do this to... to know
what I'm gonna tell them.

01:24:02.578 --> 01:24:05.430
I've thought about this
moment a thousand times...

01:24:09.268 --> 01:24:11.403
About what I'd say to you.

01:24:17.509 --> 01:24:19.744
I'm sorry.

01:24:19.812 --> 01:24:21.546
I'm so sorry.

01:24:24.716 --> 01:24:26.851
I've tried to forgive you.

01:24:28.619 --> 01:24:32.989
Everybody says that you have
to try to forgive and move on,

01:24:33.057 --> 01:24:35.158
but what people
don't understand

01:24:35.226 --> 01:24:37.861
is that I can't move on.

01:24:39.797 --> 01:24:44.149
I see you every time
I close my eyes.

01:24:44.217 --> 01:24:48.086
I see you every time
I go to sleep at night.

01:24:50.123 --> 01:24:52.791
You took something away
from me that night,

01:24:52.859 --> 01:24:54.994
that I will never get back.

01:24:57.029 --> 01:25:00.114
I hate you. I hate you.

01:25:00.182 --> 01:25:01.966
I hate you for what you did.

01:25:02.034 --> 01:25:03.601
I hate you for letting her die.

01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:06.805
You could have stopped
it, and you didn't!

01:25:06.872 --> 01:25:09.941
I saw you... Look at me!

01:25:10.009 --> 01:25:11.175
Look at me!

01:25:12.777 --> 01:25:14.210
I saw your eyes that night,

01:25:14.278 --> 01:25:16.613
and you didn't have to let
it happen, and you did. Why?

01:25:16.681 --> 01:25:18.448
I don't know.

01:25:18.516 --> 01:25:20.050
Bullshit!

01:25:23.404 --> 01:25:24.504
I was weak.

01:25:24.572 --> 01:25:27.256
You're a monster.

01:25:29.309 --> 01:25:31.477
Somewhere that night,
I got lost.

01:25:32.963 --> 01:25:35.948
I let my fear take over.
I was...

01:25:38.885 --> 01:25:43.355
I became everything
I vowed not to be.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.561
I was weak.

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:55.667
And I'd do anything...

01:25:55.735 --> 01:25:58.068
I mean anything...

01:26:01.973 --> 01:26:03.641
Anything to take it back...

01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:05.376
Well, you can't. I know.

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:10.498
You made your choice
that night...

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:15.001
And I can't change that,

01:26:15.068 --> 01:26:17.270
but I'm gonna make my choice.

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:19.439
I'm gonna live my life.

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:24.177
I'm gonna show you
the same humanity

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.945
that I wish you
would have shown me.

01:26:29.349 --> 01:26:33.485
You don't deserve to live in
the same world that I do...

01:26:35.021 --> 01:26:38.323
But your life is
not mine to take...

01:26:39.242 --> 01:26:41.659
Just like Lena's wasn't yours.

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:48.715
I pray to God you
don't get lost again.

01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:52.486
I'm so sorry.

01:26:52.554 --> 01:26:53.371
I am.

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:48.672
" How did I get here? "

01:27:48.739 --> 01:27:50.257
Step in the cell.

01:27:56.562 --> 01:28:04.562
" I can't feel your heart. "

01:28:08.792 --> 01:28:10.791
" Ohh, ohh. "

01:28:21.169 --> 01:28:24.155
" Holding "

01:28:24.223 --> 01:28:29.492
" Feeling blue, "

01:28:33.131 --> 01:28:40.269
" around you, hold on. "
