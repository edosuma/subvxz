WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.537
DAVID:
You really think she's that hot?
FREDDIE: Yes, absolutely.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.639
Oh, you guys were gone
for so long.

00:05.673 --> 00:07.141
How was your hike
in Runyon Canyon?

00:07.175 --> 00:10.678
It was crazy-- Bar Refaeli
was there and she passed out.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.513
David gave her
mouth-to-mouth.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.182
Which was wasted on him.
I could've done that.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.816
He totally
CPR-blocked me, man.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.151
Well, good for you.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.686
Just wash your lips
before you come to bed tonight.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.989
Well, I ended up
having a great time with Donny.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.325
I can't wait till we
have a son that I can
do outdoor stuff with.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.327
You mean like the camping trip
I have tomorrow night

00:26.360 --> 00:27.528
with Donny's Cub Scout troop?

00:27.561 --> 00:29.197
You really think it's fun
to sleep on the ground,

00:29.230 --> 00:30.898
listen to kids complain
about no Internet

00:30.931 --> 00:33.167
and think every sound
they hear is a ghost rapist?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.902
DAVID:
Are you kidding me?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.036
I would love to do that.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.072
After all,
I am an Eagle Scout for life.

00:38.106 --> 00:40.208
"Once an Eagle,
always an Eagle."

00:40.241 --> 00:41.942
And one day
our son will be one, too.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.344
What? No.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.579
No, I'm no letting our son
be a part of the Boy Scouts.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.681
I mean, not that they would
let him be involved anyway.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.882
Not with two gay dads.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.718
That's their policy.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.052
Oh, come on,
they don't enforce that.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.254
Yes, they do.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.588
They kick out more gay men

00:54.622 --> 00:55.923
than the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.057
Don't you read the news?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.559
Look, I know that
the Boy Scouts

00:58.592 --> 01:01.129
haven't exactly rolled out
the red carpet for gay people,

01:01.162 --> 01:03.397
but this isn't about politics;

01:03.431 --> 01:04.465
it's about boys
toasting marshmallows

01:04.498 --> 01:05.733
and making lanyards

01:05.766 --> 01:07.401
and learning that when
a black bear attacks,

01:07.435 --> 01:09.437
you play dead, but when
a grizzly bear attacks,

01:09.470 --> 01:10.604
you stand up
and you fight.

01:10.638 --> 01:11.939
And when a West Hollywood
bear attacks,

01:11.972 --> 01:13.907
you pretend to hate it.

01:13.941 --> 01:14.908
I just can't believe
you would support

01:14.942 --> 01:16.076
an organization
that excludes you.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.746
I support the virtues
that the Scouts teach:

01:18.779 --> 01:21.782
to be trustworthy, loyal,
helpful, courteous,

01:21.815 --> 01:23.251
thrifty and brave.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.985
Oh, so they're the ones
that taught you that thrifty

01:25.018 --> 01:26.320
is a virtue.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.422
No, that was Rabbi Abramowitz.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.090
Look, I know that you think

01:30.124 --> 01:31.259
this is a joke,

01:31.292 --> 01:33.161
but the Scouts taught me
the life skills

01:33.194 --> 01:34.462
that I use to this day.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.164
Dude, you're so into
this Scouting stuff,

01:36.197 --> 01:37.798
you're the one that should
chaperone this overnight.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.433
Are you kidding me?
I would love to.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.801
Fine, go.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.503
Maybe you can earn
your hypocrisy badge.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.806
Are there really bears
in West Hollywood?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.808
Yes, but don't worry,

01:47.841 --> 01:50.378
you have to be 21 or over
to get in those places.

01:53.381 --> 01:54.782
Thank you for helping me update

01:54.815 --> 01:56.517
this business software, Rocky.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.852
Well, a business woman
has to manage her money.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.087
Trust me, I know.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.355
Six years ago

02:01.389 --> 02:04.124
I went into debt buying
Balenciaga gold leggings

02:04.158 --> 02:06.194
like Beyoncé wore
to the BET Awards.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.430
Split up the back
when I dropped my lollipop.
Ooh.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.698
So, how long have you had
this computer?

02:10.731 --> 02:12.366
Oh, it was a gift.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.767
It's not really
much of a gift.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.002
I mean, I just
cleared the

02:15.035 --> 02:16.003
memory off my old computer,

02:16.036 --> 02:18.005
bounced on some extra RAM.

02:18.038 --> 02:20.040
And loaded Quicken
and a spreadsheet generator.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.041
Look, Mom,

02:21.074 --> 02:23.311
it's like a
really heavy, slow iPad.

02:23.344 --> 02:26.547
Oh, thank
you so much, Brice.

02:26.580 --> 02:30.284
So, your nana's man
gave you a computer,

02:30.318 --> 02:32.686
helped you find
a business property

02:32.720 --> 02:34.622
and didn't take a commission?
Mm-mm.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.957
You don't need Quicken to tell
you that doesn't add up.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.394
I feel like you want me
to think that's bad?

02:40.428 --> 02:42.796
You are so damn country, honey.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.465
This is L.A.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.236
You do not trust any man
who gives you a gift over $20

02:48.269 --> 02:50.571
unless he is your man-man,

02:50.604 --> 02:53.474
blood relation,
employer or a pimp,

02:53.507 --> 02:55.476
which is the same thing.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
Let me know if you have any
questions about this software.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.413
I'm off to a meeting.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.749
Ooh, a meeting?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.818
Where are we off to today,
fellow businesswoman?

03:04.852 --> 03:08.856
To a place I like to call
"mind your own damn business."

03:08.889 --> 03:11.024
(quietly):
'Kay. Have fun.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.030
Phew, for a second there,
I really thought you were

03:50.063 --> 03:51.365
going to
embarrass yourself,

03:51.399 --> 03:52.700
but that little cap
pulled it all together.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.768
You know, Bry,
you don't always

03:54.802 --> 03:55.936
have to be
so brutally honest.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.572
Some things
are better left unsaid.

03:58.606 --> 03:59.873
What?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.475
I didn't say anything
about your neckerchief.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.111
Welcome,

04:04.144 --> 04:06.947
to the Tuesday meeting
of Loveaholics Anonymous.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.248
My name is Ben,

04:08.282 --> 04:09.817
and I'm a loveaholic.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.585
OTHERS:
Hi, Ben.

04:11.619 --> 04:12.786
BEN:
L-Anon is a fellowship

04:12.820 --> 04:14.555
of men and women

04:14.588 --> 04:17.591
whose common purpose is to stop
the unhealthy patterns

04:17.625 --> 04:21.829
of relying on love and intimacy.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.599
Remember, let's please avoid
trigger words

04:25.633 --> 04:26.967
such as the names
of dating Web sites,

04:27.000 --> 04:28.302
Nicholas Sparks

04:28.336 --> 04:30.270
and "die alone."

04:30.304 --> 04:32.840
I have two days of abstinence

04:32.873 --> 04:37.578
from fantasizing about
my landlady, Estafania.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.179
I just relapsed.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.449
But I couldn't eat
at the restaurant

04:41.482 --> 04:42.750
because I'm in
Overeaters Anonymous

04:42.783 --> 04:44.184
and he couldn't
pay the bill because

04:44.217 --> 04:45.319
he's in Debtors Anonymous,

04:45.353 --> 04:47.421
so we ended up doing cocaine
in his minivan,

04:47.455 --> 04:49.189
which would've been a slipup
in Narcotics Anonymous,

04:49.222 --> 04:51.859
but I don't really need
that program, so I quit going.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.262
And so I sent an e-mail
to his fiancée that said,

04:55.295 --> 04:56.664
"If I can't have Richard,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.032
I'll turn your face into
a toilet bowl of blood."

04:59.066 --> 05:02.202
I heard about y'all on a
Tavis Smiley episode,

05:02.235 --> 05:05.105
which I was watching
because I am...

05:05.138 --> 05:08.208
I mean, was, in love with him.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.879
I've made so many foolish
choices for love.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.482
Darnell, you hungry, baby?!

05:14.515 --> 05:15.949
I got what you need!

05:15.983 --> 05:17.217
Love me!

05:17.250 --> 05:20.153
(glass shatters,
siren whoops)

05:20.187 --> 05:22.790
I had to get honest with myself
and say,

05:22.823 --> 05:25.292
"Rocky, you need help."

05:25.325 --> 05:26.960
And that's why
I'm standing here

05:26.994 --> 05:30.964
celebrating 90 days of
abstinence from love addiction.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.568
(applause)

05:38.338 --> 05:39.640
BEN:
Does anyone else
want to share?

05:39.673 --> 05:41.675
Anyone?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.143
MAN:
Ah, what the hell.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.311
BEN:
Hey.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.679
(gasps)

05:46.714 --> 05:47.915
I'm Brice.

05:47.948 --> 05:50.317
I'm a loveaholic,
uh, romance addict

05:50.350 --> 05:52.986
and-and basically
a compulsive playa, whatever.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.688
OTHERS: Hi, Brice.
Hi.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.390
If you're a woman, uh, I will

05:56.424 --> 05:57.858
make you fall in love with me

05:57.891 --> 05:59.860
no matter how much
chaos it causes.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.796
That's always been my drug
of choice.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.567
Hi. How was your camping trip?

06:06.600 --> 06:11.204
I am not going to lie,
it was pretty incredible.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.373
We set traps,
built lean-tos,

06:13.407 --> 06:14.575
identified edible plants.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.410
It's hard for me
to share in your excitement

06:16.444 --> 06:19.046
when I know you also pooped
in the woods like animals.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.781
Not like animals--

06:20.814 --> 06:22.282
they don't bring
their own wipes.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.752
Oh, my God,
I missed it so much.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.220
Being in the wilderness.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.222
Teaching the kids
all those skills.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.703
Okay,
who's hungry?

06:42.736 --> 06:45.105
Bryan, I was awesome.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.940
It sounds rustic
and unsanitary.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.042
And strangely sexy.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.377
And they were okay
with you being gay?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.714
Actually,
it never really came up.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.716
DONNY:
I want to be an
Eagle Scout, just like you,

06:55.749 --> 06:56.950
Scoutmaster David.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.053
So, Dave, uh, no kids
of your own yet, huh?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.389
Well, actually,
we're expecting a boy in June.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.091
Congratulations.
Thank you.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.293
I'll bet the old ball and chain
is counting down the days

07:06.326 --> 07:07.728
till that happens, huh?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.564
Oh, no, I dropped
my weenie in the embers.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.000
Uh, don't worry,
I'll take care of this.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.436
So, sort of a lie of omission.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.006
Bryan, I know you
want to paint the Boy Scouts

07:19.039 --> 07:20.340
as some sort of hate group,

07:20.373 --> 07:21.675
but I had a great time.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.810
And you know what?

07:22.843 --> 07:24.277
The troop is meeting again
on Thursday,

07:24.311 --> 07:26.413
and I'm going to take
Donny to that, too.
Okay.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.015
Well, if you're
convinced they're so accepting

07:28.048 --> 07:29.449
of a gay person
in their group,

07:29.483 --> 07:30.784
why don't you
have the meeting here...

07:30.818 --> 07:31.852
where you live...

07:31.885 --> 07:33.353
with a man...

07:33.386 --> 07:34.655
who you take baths with.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.157
Fine, I think that's
a great idea.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.492
And if it makes
you feel better,

07:38.526 --> 07:41.194
I'll put a big gay badge
on my sash.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.531
Hmm, an organization

07:43.564 --> 07:45.499
that discriminates
against gay people,

07:45.533 --> 07:48.368
yet mandates all its members
wear a sash.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.403
Interesting.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.046
Now, in order to earn
your entomology badge,

07:59.079 --> 08:01.549
you have to not only
know what an insect is,

08:01.582 --> 08:03.450
but also what an insect isn't.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.718
Now, who can take a look
at the board

08:04.752 --> 08:08.556
and tell me which of these
is not an insect?

08:08.589 --> 08:09.790
Go.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.292
(shouting answers)

08:12.325 --> 08:13.527
Wrong.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.696
None of them are.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.397
They are arachnids.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.966
BOYS:
Oh...

08:18.999 --> 08:21.468
You know
everything, David.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.970
I mean, you should get
a merit badge

08:23.003 --> 08:24.137
in just overall smartness?

08:24.171 --> 08:25.973
You mean, like this one?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.307
My mom made that.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.909
Although,
not officially sanctioned.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.645
And your house should have one
for tasteful decorating.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.981
Thank you, but I cannot take
credit for that.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.483
That goes to my...

08:36.516 --> 08:38.418
better half.
(door closing)

08:38.451 --> 08:42.489
(clears throat)
Who, I believe, just arrived.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.191
Uh, just excuse me one second.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.994
(low chatter)

08:47.027 --> 08:48.428
Hey.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.597
Glad you're here.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.431
Are you sure
you want to do this?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.033
Yep, yeah, yeah.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.735
Absolutely.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.136
They're going
to love you.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.041
Hi, everybody.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.713
I would like you
to meet Bryan.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.214
He is...

09:07.247 --> 09:08.548
my life partner.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.118
My fiancé, in fact.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.120
We're getting married.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.957
And we're having
a-a baby boy soon.

09:16.990 --> 09:21.061
Just two men, in love.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.596
Sharing a life.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.699
Bryan Collins.

09:25.733 --> 09:26.967
(sighs)

09:30.103 --> 09:33.473
*

09:37.978 --> 09:40.280
Obviously,
you didn't tell us everything.

09:40.313 --> 09:44.618
Like, how did you land yourself
an Eagle Scout, Bryan?

09:44.652 --> 09:46.119
David is amazing.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.454
You're a very lucky man.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.889
Don't I know it.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.123
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.925
Nice to meet you.
Come on, guys.
Come on.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.227
Oh, there's so...
so many of you.
Hi.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.463
Hey, Lil' Shane.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.331
How's my sweet Nikki?

09:58.365 --> 09:59.900
Did she give you
any trouble today?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.334
No, I love babysitting Nikki.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.402
In fact,

10:02.435 --> 10:03.937
we're playing Project Runway.

10:03.971 --> 10:04.938
I'm Nina Garcia

10:04.972 --> 10:06.106
and I'm about to deliver

10:06.139 --> 10:08.341
an icy, scolding
criticism of this.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.844
(Rocky gasps)

10:10.878 --> 10:12.012
You know, until
this moment, I haven't

10:12.045 --> 10:13.781
considered the possibility

10:13.814 --> 10:16.016
of your weirdness
rubbing off on her.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.818
I am kind of
her role model.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.020
Hmm, so what's
with all these boxes?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.354
Did you jack a Staples?

10:21.388 --> 10:24.491
No, Brice borrowed them
from his office

10:24.524 --> 10:26.193
to give to Mom for
her new business.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.861
And he brought me
the sweet potato flavored

10:27.895 --> 10:30.163
Japanese candy I love

10:30.197 --> 10:31.832
that I'll assume he paid for.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.033
He's so awesome.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.035
Shania, how often does Brice

10:35.068 --> 10:36.469
stop by here to see your mom?

10:36.503 --> 10:38.371
Not every day or anything.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.674
Sometimes he visits at her
new store instead.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.809
Mm-hmm.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.877
Are you ever going to pay me
for babysitting?

10:43.911 --> 10:45.445
Not now, baby.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.048
I got real problems.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.852
Bryan, can I ask
your opinion about something?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.854
Is it about your attraction
to Colin Powell?

10:53.887 --> 10:56.156
Because I completely
understand.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.357
It's a power thing.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.227
No, I was wondering if you would
tell the truth

11:00.260 --> 11:03.196
even if what you say may hurt
that person's feelings.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.297
You think I'm fat.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.133
I'm not even talking about you.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.301
You think David's fat. You
should definitely say something.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.303
This is not about
you or David.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.572
Then I'm less interested.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.743
(sighs)
I don't want to say something
to someone,

11:15.776 --> 11:17.644
but by not saying
something, it could mess up

11:17.677 --> 11:18.912
someone else's life.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.480
Who are all
these anonymous people?

11:20.513 --> 11:21.882
I can't say.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.817
Further disinterested.
Look, Rocky,

11:23.851 --> 11:25.485
sometimes you think
the truth is going to hurt,

11:25.518 --> 11:26.987
but it ends up helping.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.322
Like how I encouraged David with
the Boy Scouts the other day.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.858
The whole thing
was a huge success,

11:30.891 --> 11:32.525
and now we're gonna have more
Scouting events at the house.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.661
And that was supposed
to encourage me?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.563
My point is,
is that by being honest,

11:36.596 --> 11:38.832
David is able to be who he is

11:38.866 --> 11:40.333
in a group
that he loves.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.335
To me, the truth
is an obligation:

11:42.369 --> 11:43.871
you just have
to say it out loud.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.039
Okay. Well...

11:46.073 --> 11:48.942
you look like a real skinny
Bob's Big Boy.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.611
Damn. You're right.

11:51.644 --> 11:54.414
(snaps fingers)
That felt really good
to get that off my chest.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.184
Skinny?

11:57.217 --> 12:00.854
Excuse me, fellow love addict.
May I have a word?

12:00.888 --> 12:04.357
(quietly):
Careful. She is
aggressive and broken.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.526
Hey, what's up, Rocky?
Oh, and may I say,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.428
the way you look
in those black suede

12:08.461 --> 12:09.897
Christian Louboutin
ankle boots,

12:09.930 --> 12:12.265
that is proof
there's a higher power.

12:12.299 --> 12:14.768
Yeah, well, if you don't
back up off of Goldie,

12:14.802 --> 12:16.069
I will apply
the red bottom

12:16.103 --> 12:17.604
of these boots to your ass.

12:17.637 --> 12:18.972
What are you talking about?
I'm just trying

12:19.006 --> 12:20.040
to help her
launch her business.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.742
Goldie is a pregnant woman

12:22.776 --> 12:24.611
with a ten-year-old
and an ex who is not

12:24.644 --> 12:26.780
out of the picture
and a grandmother

12:26.814 --> 12:29.282
who you are dating!
And you call that "recovery"

12:29.316 --> 12:32.085
and "integrity"
and "honesty"?

12:32.119 --> 12:33.453
Bitch, please.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.788
Do you want to see honesty?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.256
Come here. Look into this room.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.125
This room-- that is where
I'm learning to be of service

12:38.158 --> 12:40.093
to people. That is why
I'm helping Goldie.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.594
If you don't back up
off of Goldie,

12:41.628 --> 12:43.230
I will tell her that you are

12:43.263 --> 12:44.798
a love addict with
an agenda to get

12:44.832 --> 12:48.135
into her elastic-waist pants.
Believe that.

12:48.168 --> 12:51.004
You know what? It's time for you
to stop protecting Goldie

12:51.038 --> 12:52.539
and start taking care
of yourself.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.812
Ben, stop trying
to smell my hair.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.348
You are so sick.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.953
What is this?

13:05.986 --> 13:09.022
That is a pinewood derby car.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.859
I made it for you in Scouts
to say thank you.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.526
It's your Range Rover.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.163
Aw, you even put the little
steering wheel on the right.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.166
How faithful to the pretentious
British engineering.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.034
What are you thanking me for?

13:21.068 --> 13:24.704
Well, without you, I don't know
if I would've had the courage

13:24.737 --> 13:27.707
to be honest about who I am
with the Scout troop.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.210
I was just
a confused kid

13:30.243 --> 13:31.544
when I joined the Scouts,

13:31.578 --> 13:33.280
looking for something--
I don't even know what.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.714
And what'd you find?

13:34.747 --> 13:37.951
I found role models.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.220
I found men that showed me
how to be the father

13:40.253 --> 13:41.621
that I hope to become.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.891
Something that my father
wasn't able to do.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.558
You know,
when I joined the Scouts,

13:45.592 --> 13:48.295
with all the other kids
and their fathers around,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.397
it was like family.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.400
I mean, that's why
I was scared to...

13:53.433 --> 13:56.469
tell everybody that I was gay.
I mean, 'cause it...

13:56.503 --> 14:00.240
felt like I was coming out
all over again.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.910
Thank you for keeping me honest.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.913
You're welcome.

14:05.946 --> 14:09.549
But, David, why are there tiny
cigarette butts in the ashtray?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.584
I'm just keeping you honest.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.852
Uh-huh.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.524
Oh, honey, you got a letter
from the Scouts today.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.559
(water running)

14:22.295 --> 14:24.264
Ooh.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.133
(water stops running)

14:27.234 --> 14:29.036
"...homosexual conduct..."

14:30.203 --> 14:32.172
"...your Boy Scout membership
revoked."

14:32.205 --> 14:34.607
Sorry, what'd you say?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.527
BRYAN:
Oh, my God, it's like
a nerd-boy Hunger Games.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.695
Scoutmaster David!

14:55.728 --> 14:57.097
At ease, troop.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.699
I'm just here for some
grown-up talk with your dads.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.368
Come on. We're going
for our archery badges.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.204
Show us how you do it.
(others agreeing)

15:04.237 --> 15:06.773
I can't help you, boys.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.141
I'm sorry.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.713
What's up, D?
BRYAN:
He calls you D?

15:13.746 --> 15:16.783
(sighs)
Someone reported me
to the Boy Scouts of America.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.453
BRYAN:
As an "avowed homosexual."
A term I admittedly love.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.455
Makes me feel
like an old-fashioned gay

15:22.489 --> 15:24.958
like Alexander the Great
or Jim Nabors.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.459
DAVID:
I was kicked out.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.795
I'm no longer
an Eagle Scout.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.063
What?
Can they even do that?

15:30.097 --> 15:34.267
Look, I was honest with you guys
about who I am.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.304
Just be honest with me about
which one of you reported me.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.107
Me? Dude, come on.
I wish I could be gay.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.342
So much more sex,
so much less listening.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.343
I would never do that.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.112
You guys were cool
as hell to us.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.980
One of the kids probably told
their parents. I don't know.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.182
FREDDIE:
No one cares about
the gay thing.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.018
The Scout board's
voting on it in May.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.519
They're gonna shoot it down.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.686
Probably.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.921
Just hang with us
in the meantime.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.656
HANK:
No one cares about
any Scout rules.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.658
You ever actually
read the manual?

15:58.691 --> 16:00.827
Do I look fit
of mind and body?

16:00.860 --> 16:02.195
And don't
get me started

16:02.229 --> 16:03.663
on the self-abuse chapter.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.864
FREDDIE:
For real.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.099
What grown man would actually

16:06.133 --> 16:08.168
want to live
by these principles?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.636
I would.
David would.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.207
Loyal,

16:14.241 --> 16:15.208
trustworthy,

16:15.242 --> 16:17.110
kind.

16:17.144 --> 16:21.114
When the Scouts can live up to
the values that they taught me,

16:21.148 --> 16:24.684
I'm happy to be of service.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.287
How can you disrespect
the Scouts like this?

16:27.320 --> 16:28.788
I thought you loved them.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.290
I do.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.060
But they don't respect
the way that I love.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.470
Hi, Rocky.
I'll make this quick.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.306
I don't like parking my car
in your neighborhood.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.041
Brice is bad news.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.642
I can't say how I know,

16:49.676 --> 16:51.244
but he's a love predator.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.046
Who, Brice? What are
you talking about?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.714
He's only ever been nice to me.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.050
Goldie, I know you're from Ohio,

16:57.084 --> 17:00.019
but men have penises
in the Midwest, don't they?

17:00.053 --> 17:03.223
Yes. Except for that man who
fell into his threshing machine.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.025
Brice is trying to
take advantage of you.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.361
You better watch your
back and your front.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.030
But, in-in your case, your back.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.000
Oh... Brice has been nothing
but a gentleman to me.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.903
I mean, if anyone's taking
advantage of anyone, it's...

17:16.936 --> 17:18.905
it's me.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.907
(sighs)
The truth is,

17:20.940 --> 17:24.411
I think I have
a secret crush on Brice.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.745
And the reason
he keeps coming over

17:25.778 --> 17:28.515
is 'cause I keep making up
excuses to see him.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.716
You have a computer problem?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.219
I'm trying to come up
with a log-in password,

17:32.252 --> 17:33.886
Uh-huh.
and it keeps
calling it "weak."

17:33.920 --> 17:35.755
It's really shaken
my confidence.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.590
Oh, simple. Just think of
your favorite character

17:37.624 --> 17:39.459
from literature and the age
you lost your virginity.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.893
Ooh, I got it.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.463
Garfield15.
(typing)

17:44.964 --> 17:47.934
Please don't tell Nana or Brice.
This is the first time

17:47.967 --> 17:50.603
I've admitted it to anyone,
including myself.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.405
I'm gonna be
completely honest with you:

17:52.439 --> 17:53.940
90 days ago,

17:53.973 --> 17:56.109
I realized I was
spending my time

17:56.143 --> 17:58.245
focusing on a man
instead of myself.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.113
And that's what I'm starting
to see you do.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.481
When you put it like that,
it kind of makes

18:01.514 --> 18:03.616
the secret crush less fun.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.952
Since I stopped worrying
about "he"

18:05.985 --> 18:07.820
and started thinking about "me,"

18:07.854 --> 18:09.956
I'm happier than
I've ever been.

18:09.989 --> 18:13.126
I know. I've watched you grow.
You're amazing.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.796
But... how did you know
that's what you needed to do?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.965
I looked at you,
and I said,

18:18.998 --> 18:22.469
"If this dumb-ass Ohio girl
can make a great life

18:22.502 --> 18:24.804
"and a successful business
out of nothing

18:24.837 --> 18:28.241
by focusing on her family
and herself, so can I."

18:28.275 --> 18:30.510
Aw. Rocky.

18:30.543 --> 18:34.113
This Brice thing is just
a distraction from you.

18:34.147 --> 18:36.115
It's not real.

18:36.149 --> 18:38.651
And you are a miracle.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.088
Aw.
(chuckles)

18:42.121 --> 18:43.590
(doorbell rings)

18:43.623 --> 18:45.192
Hey, David.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.927
Oh... Scoutmaster Pat.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.596
Come on in.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.831
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

18:51.864 --> 18:54.701
my son Kyle, uh,
quit the Scouts.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.036
Said he didn't want to be
part of an organization

18:57.069 --> 18:59.339
that discriminated
against men like you.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.275
Well, that's... very brave.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.277
That's exactly the kind
of Scout that they need.

19:04.311 --> 19:07.980
In the spirit
of Scout's honor, I, uh...

19:08.014 --> 19:11.117
I feel that you deserve
to know the truth:

19:11.150 --> 19:14.554
I was the one who called
the national office about you.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.557
Look, everyone knows
you're everything

19:17.590 --> 19:19.492
an Eagle Scout should be.

19:19.526 --> 19:22.128
But it's not just that.
You know, you're...

19:22.161 --> 19:23.630
you're a successful doctor,

19:23.663 --> 19:25.798
you have a beautiful home

19:25.832 --> 19:28.167
and you have
a supportive partner--

19:28.201 --> 19:30.470
you have it all.
And, uh...

19:30.503 --> 19:32.905
and I want my son
to have it all, too.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.476
Yes, well,
I'm sure that he will.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.212
But I want him to have it all...

19:39.246 --> 19:40.413
with a woman.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.483
You are a perfect
role model,

19:43.516 --> 19:45.184
but the truth is

19:45.218 --> 19:48.688
I don't want you to be
the role model for my son.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.691
I'm no homophobe.
I like you.

19:51.724 --> 19:54.327
My son loves you.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.028
Ever since he met you,
he's done nothing

19:56.062 --> 19:58.698
but talk about how great you are

19:58.731 --> 20:01.368
and how he wants
to be just like you.

20:01.401 --> 20:04.036
But I want him to be,

20:04.070 --> 20:06.038
you know...

20:06.072 --> 20:07.574
normal.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.246
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.558
(sighs)

20:30.797 --> 20:32.399
DAVID: When I joined the Scouts,
the most coveted badges

20:32.432 --> 20:33.766
you could earn were archery

20:33.800 --> 20:35.368
and Indian lore.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.937
Today, it's robotics
and nuclear medicine.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.306
I know-- equally cool, right?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.644
No one can deny
the world is changing.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.113
And in some ways,
the Scouts have proven

20:47.146 --> 20:48.915
they can change with it.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.621
So I'm going
to honor the oath I took

20:54.654 --> 20:57.824
and use all the values
I learned:

20:57.857 --> 21:03.563
honesty, perseverance,
bravery and courage

21:03.596 --> 21:07.934
to fight for change,
so that maybe one day,

21:07.967 --> 21:11.971
I can help my son
earn his own badges.

21:16.843 --> 21:20.313
Like the Scouts taught me:
be prepared.

21:20.347 --> 21:26.653
Because change is coming.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.389
