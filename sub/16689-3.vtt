WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.604
For the last three years
Chef Ramsay

00:03.637 --> 00:05.873
has whipped aspiring chefs

00:05.906 --> 00:07.474
into shape
on Hell's Kitchen.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.543
this is painful!
Get out!

00:09.576 --> 00:10.811
Out!

00:10.844 --> 00:12.379
Now Gordon Ramsay,

00:12.412 --> 00:13.647
the most
successful restaurateur

00:13.680 --> 00:14.982
on the planet

00:15.015 --> 00:16.617
with critically-acclaimed
restaurants

00:16.650 --> 00:19.419
in London, Dubai, Tokyo,
and New York,

00:19.453 --> 00:21.088
is criss-crossing America

00:21.121 --> 00:22.990
for the most difficult
assignment of his career.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.958
This is disgusting!

00:24.992 --> 00:26.326
I am gob-smacked.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.661
Turning around America's

00:27.694 --> 00:28.896
Kitchen Nightmares.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.000
Please help me!

00:30.000 --> 00:30.464
Please help me!

00:30.497 --> 00:32.199
Each week he will go

00:32.232 --> 00:33.700
to restaurants
on the brink of disaster.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.801
There is no more money.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.303
He's not doing his job!

00:36.336 --> 00:37.504
This place is a disaster zone!

00:37.538 --> 00:39.172
I put so much into it.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.441
But to get these restaurants
back on track,

00:41.475 --> 00:43.844
Chef Ramsay
will hold nothing back.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.979
Never, ever, ever,

00:46.013 --> 00:51.718
ever met someone I believe in
as little as you.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.320
It will be intense.

00:53.353 --> 00:55.122
you all,
you dirty pigs!

00:55.155 --> 00:56.823
Do we need a death
in the restaurant

00:56.857 --> 00:58.225
before some
gets a grip?

00:58.258 --> 00:59.860
I thought your food was crap.

00:59.893 --> 01:00.000
I'd rather have
this conversation downstairs.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.161
I'd rather have
this conversation downstairs.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.329
You!

01:02.362 --> 01:03.630
It will be emotional.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.364
You're a!

01:04.398 --> 01:05.299
That's it!

01:05.332 --> 01:06.500
Seriously, I'm pissed off!

01:06.533 --> 01:07.568
It's not my fault!

01:07.601 --> 01:09.169
Why did you keep eating

01:09.202 --> 01:10.170
if it was that bad?

01:10.203 --> 01:11.471
Go!
Just go!

01:11.505 --> 01:13.206
And it will be shocking.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.441
Fire them on the spot.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.376
Oh, my God.
Look at them.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.712
It's  rancid!
It's rotten!

01:18.745 --> 01:19.980
I've eaten it!

01:20.013 --> 01:21.582
I feel like spitting
on both of them.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.750
I think this place
is run better without you.

01:23.784 --> 01:26.486
Can you go tell them
that the kitchen is closed?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.721
We're shut!

01:27.754 --> 01:29.089
It's the luckiest day
of their lives!

01:29.122 --> 01:30.000
We're shut for the night?

01:30.000 --> 01:30.190
We're shut for the night?

01:30.223 --> 01:32.693
We're shut for the night!

01:32.726 --> 01:34.294
We will make this a success.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.196
Put your hand up
and swear to God.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.799
In the end you will see
dramatic turnarounds.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.267
Are they horrible?

01:42.369 --> 01:44.338
And not just the restaurants...

01:44.371 --> 01:45.906
Whoo!

01:45.939 --> 01:47.174
Ooh, I like this.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.742
Oh, it's fantastic.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.677
but the people
who work in them.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.312
I'll never forget you, man,
the rest of my life.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.981
You're the best, man.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.016
And while most
appreciate his help...

01:56.049 --> 01:57.084
God bless you.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.685
You are
a wonderful person.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.000
others aren't so grateful.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.153
others aren't so grateful.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.655
It's my!

02:01.688 --> 02:03.890
Chef, I know you can hear me!
Don't run!

02:03.924 --> 02:05.058
Why is this guy here?!

02:05.092 --> 02:06.426
Who the
are you

02:06.460 --> 02:07.761
to turn around
and tell me

02:07.794 --> 02:09.162
when you work
like a pig?

02:09.196 --> 02:10.564
You  pig!

02:10.597 --> 02:13.033
Good-bye, Chef.
Good luck...loser.

02:13.066 --> 02:17.304
Get ready as Chef Ramsay turns
America's kitchen nightmares...

02:17.337 --> 02:19.373
Thank you, God, for what we're
about to receive.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.174
May the Lord not kill me
with food poisoning.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.343
back into dreams.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.680
Please.
Do not screw it up.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.166
Tonight Gordon faces
an overwhelming challenge.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.601
Time to walk away.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.803
There's nothing else to do.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.838
The Mixing Bowl's business
is dwindling,

02:51.872 --> 02:53.006
and relationships
are crumbling.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.241
You can't get so overwhelmed!

02:54.274 --> 02:55.308
I wasn't told!

02:55.342 --> 02:56.643
Why do you keep saying that?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.978
I'm pissed off!

02:58.011 --> 02:59.312
The manager is desperate.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.000
I've tried everything.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.380
I've tried everything.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.416
The owner has lost his passion.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.985
You look like a man that's dyin'
to be put out of his misery.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.220
And his wife wants him
to shut the place down.

03:07.254 --> 03:10.857
I can't sacrifice myself
for The Mixing bowl anymore.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.427
Now Gordon must turn
The Mixing Bowl upside down.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.495
I'm fighting
for my life here.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.464
It's the last chance
for this dying restaurant.

03:17.497 --> 03:20.133
Do not talk to me like that!

03:20.167 --> 03:22.869
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.000
Bellmore, New York,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.044
Bellmore, New York,

03:31.078 --> 03:33.980
a busy commuter town
about 30 minutes

03:34.014 --> 03:35.916
from New York City and home

03:35.949 --> 03:37.918
to a wide variety
of restaurants.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.388
For ten years The Mixing Bowl
has managed to survive.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.457
But now with increased
competition,

03:43.490 --> 03:45.125
it's only months away
from closing.

03:45.158 --> 03:47.394
He said Cajun, not Asian.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.997
My name is Billy Galetti.

03:51.031 --> 03:51.932
I'm the Chef/Owner
of The Mixing Bowl.

03:51.965 --> 03:54.134
Pick it up!

03:54.167 --> 03:56.336
I'm the chef,
the delivery guy, Mr. Fix it.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.638
I'm doing bills,
picking up supplies.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.000
I mop the floors
if I have to.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.474
I mop the floors
if I have to.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.677
That's what I have
to do to keep the place alive.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.413
The Mixing Bowl Eatery
has been here for ten years.

04:06.446 --> 04:07.581
Lisa.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.516
Is this order right?
You know what?

04:09.549 --> 04:11.151
You should talk to your manager,
not your wife.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.719
If it was up to Billy's wife

04:12.753 --> 04:14.521
the restaurant
would be closed next week.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.323
It says two mussels.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.657
It should say one.

04:17.691 --> 04:21.328
My hope is really gone
for this place.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.263
How bad was it
yesterday?

04:23.296 --> 04:24.765
Disaster.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.666
Six people came in the
restaurant all night last night.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.135
Everyone just knows me
as "Mixing Bowl Mike."

04:28.168 --> 04:29.703
Right this way,
young ladies.

04:29.736 --> 04:30.000
Yes, he's the manager.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.505
Yes, he's the manager.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.673
But it's impossible
to work with him.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.742
You get five times more pay
than the servers!

04:35.776 --> 04:37.310
What the hell is
your problem?

04:37.344 --> 04:38.745
Kinda like
one big, happy family.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.781
What you just said
makes absolutely no sense.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.449
And you got 100, you got 100,
you get over 100--

04:42.482 --> 04:43.750
That doesn't
make sense.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.518
I'm thinkin'--
Shut up

04:44.551 --> 04:47.053
Aye yai yai.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.922
Mike, what are
you doin'?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.824
I'm taking a drink
'cause I'm parched.

04:50.857 --> 04:51.925
He is the manager.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.426
Oh, my God.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.995
What does Mike do now.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.000
I see him schmooze a lot.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.369
I see him schmooze a lot.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.805
People come in here,
and they think I'm the owner.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.873
They call me, like,
the mayor of Bellmore.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.241
Do they do that because
they respect me, they fear me?

05:08.275 --> 05:08.875
I don't know.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.577
Do whatever--
Shut up.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.878
Let me finish talking.
Don't tell me
to shut up.

05:11.912 --> 05:12.946
You respect me.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.314
Nobody's gonna listen
to someone who's yelling

05:14.347 --> 05:15.849
at them like a mad man.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.551
Talking to you
is like talking to a brick wall.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.051
All right,
all right, all right.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.524
When The Mixing Bowl
first opened

05:24.558 --> 05:25.959
it was busy every week,
you know,

05:25.992 --> 05:29.462
it was really doing well.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.000
Now it's just a slow...

05:30.000 --> 05:31.131
Now it's just a slow...

05:31.164 --> 05:33.533
Everybody's, like, depressed.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.202
We tried everything that we can.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.170
There is no more money.

05:37.204 --> 05:41.408
There--there's nothing--
there's nothing else to do.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.977
If something doesn't change
and someone doesn't help us out,

05:44.010 --> 05:46.379
the restaurant
could be closed next week.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.248
Now it's at the end
of the road.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.183
I'm so stubborn
about keeping it alive.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.385
But am I hurting myself?
Am I hurting my family?

05:52.419 --> 05:55.021
You're holding everything up now
with all this crap.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.457
I'm sorry.
That's what I pulled.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.025
Our marriage gets effected
by his business.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.000
Go.
Go out, go out.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.427
Go.
Go out, go out.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.796
We're struggling
seven days a week.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.932
That puts a damper
on our relationship.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.001
I can't sacrifice myself

06:08.034 --> 06:11.338
and our children
for The Mixing Bowl anymore.

06:11.371 --> 06:15.675
If it's not gonna work,
it's time to walk away.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.816
Gordon Ramsay
has just one week

06:22.849 --> 06:24.951
to uncover
the restaurant's problems,

06:24.985 --> 06:26.987
devise a plan,
and find a way

06:27.020 --> 06:29.089
for this restaurant
to stand out

06:29.122 --> 06:30.000
in this competitive market.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.690
in this competitive market.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.728
I'm nervous
'cause this looks dreadful.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.062
Oh, my God.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.797
It's a pleasure
to have you here.

06:37.831 --> 06:38.899
Gordon.
First name?

06:38.932 --> 06:39.900
Mike Landsberg.

06:39.933 --> 06:40.901
Mike.
Nice to see you.

06:40.934 --> 06:41.902
It's exciting.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.403
Just, like, "Oh, my God.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.138
I'm meeting Gordon Ramsay,"
you know.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.873
To me he's a God
in the restaurant industry.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.642
Good to see you.
Hi.
Lisa.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.709
Lisa, nice to see you.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.611
Go on.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.179
Oh, this is quiet.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.081
Yeah.
This is the lunch crowd, us.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.616
All these staff?
One, two, three, four?

06:56.650 --> 06:57.217
How many is booked
for lunch?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.184
Nobody.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.653
No?

06:59.686 --> 07:00.000
When Gordon first came in
I was nervous.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.955
When Gordon first came in
I was nervous.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.658
And I hope he's just not
too hard on all of us.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.393
I'm gonna sit here?
Yes.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.994
This is the lunch menu.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.362
What style of restaurant is it?

07:09.396 --> 07:11.865
It's new American-type cuisine,

07:11.898 --> 07:13.033
salads, some wraps...

07:13.066 --> 07:14.768
Sounds like a health spa.

07:14.801 --> 07:15.969
Um...

07:16.002 --> 07:17.971
When was the last time
you went to a spa?

07:18.004 --> 07:19.572
The gym?

07:24.844 --> 07:27.047
What are you saying?
Are you trying to say something?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.114
I asked when was the last time
you went to a gym.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.000
Uh, not for a long time.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.951
Uh, not for a long time.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.652
When was the last time
you had a salad?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.287
Not for a long time.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.588
Right.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.990
Okay.

07:37.023 --> 07:38.692
If you have any questions,
please feel free to ask.

07:38.725 --> 07:41.428
Okay.
Great.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.697
When you look at the way
the restaurant is put together,

07:43.730 --> 07:46.466
you can identify instantly
from the paper cloths

07:46.499 --> 07:49.536
to the drapes to the plants,
to the ceiling, to the color,

07:49.569 --> 07:52.872
that this restaurant really is
on its last legs.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.342
There's not long to go here.

07:55.375 --> 07:59.012
Hmm, award-winning
Maryland lump crab cakes.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.000
North Atlantic salmon,
sun-dried tomato basil.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.514
North Atlantic salmon,
sun-dried tomato basil.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.383
For such a small restaurant
the menu's huge.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.951
You need a couple
of minutes, or--

08:04.985 --> 08:06.353
I'm dying to taste

08:06.386 --> 08:08.488
the award-winning
Maryland crab cakes.

08:08.521 --> 08:09.823
They are excellent.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.658
Award-winning?
What did they win?

08:11.691 --> 08:13.560
You could ask Billy.
He knows more about it.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.295
I thought you'd know
about it

08:15.328 --> 08:16.363
if you're the manager,
and it's on the menu.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.764
Well, I...

08:17.797 --> 08:19.265
Anyway.
I...

08:19.299 --> 08:21.201
I'll have a zucchini pancake.
Okay.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.436
And I'll go for the North
Atlantic salmon, I think.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.572
Okay.
Thank you.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.374
God, that guy needs some spark.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.742
Bean bag.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.348
And these are
the Maryland crab cakes.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.716
Thank you.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.385
And the zucchini pancakes
with chive sour cream.

08:38.418 --> 08:39.386
Lovely.
Thank you.

08:39.419 --> 08:40.387
Enjoy.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.588
Thank you.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.329
May I ask what you think
of the crab cakes?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.267
May I ask you not
to stare at me?

08:54.300 --> 08:55.402
Absolutely.
It makes me feel
really uncomfortable.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.403
No problem.

08:56.436 --> 08:57.303
You know, this cockroach
on your back.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.338
You like to shake off.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.839
I'd like to just sit
and enjoy my lunch.

08:59.873 --> 09:00.000
Absolutely.
Thank you so much.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.042
Absolutely.
Thank you so much.

09:02.075 --> 09:05.111
Mmm, award-winning?
Maybe not.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.780
In terms of freshness, yeah.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.348
I wouldn't expect to find
something so fresh

09:08.381 --> 09:10.784
in such a dreary,
dreadful dining room.

09:12.719 --> 09:17.290
Zucchini pancakes, stodgy,
bland, and zucchini thick.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.559
It's like having
a mouth full of glue.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.097
Oh, my God.
What's that on top?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.331
Tomato-basil balsamic sauce.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.533
Mm-hmm.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.101
I smell garlic.
Where's the garlic from?

09:28.134 --> 09:29.202
Is that on the green beans?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.000
The shallots.
There's--

09:30.000 --> 09:30.703
The shallots.
There's--

09:30.737 --> 09:32.205
No garlic?
No garlic in any
of the ingredients.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.940
And then on the beans?

09:33.973 --> 09:35.775
Looks like there's garlic
on there.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.143
Why don't you just check
with him?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.511
I can smell it anyway.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.979
I will.
That looks like garlic.

09:40.013 --> 09:40.980
Thank you.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.582
Billy.
What?

09:42.615 --> 09:44.017
The string beans,
you cook them in garlic?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.485
Yeah.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.387
Is there any shallots
in there at all?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.354
No shallots.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.626
The salmon was very bland,
and the sauce,

09:53.660 --> 09:56.129
just heavy, soggy,
and vinegary.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.964
Garlic everywhere.

09:57.997 --> 10:00.000
No one wants to come out
to lunch and stink of garlic.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.467
No one wants to come out
to lunch and stink of garlic.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.668
That's for sure.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.403
Billy's getting
a little nervous.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.305
Like, am I about to get reamed
by that--you know.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.643
I don't know what to expect
to be honest.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.312
When you first walk
in that dining room

10:12.345 --> 10:14.647
you get
this depressing manager

10:14.681 --> 10:18.184
jumping on you,
which is a great shame.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.086
I'm sure five years ago
you had some form of spark.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.921
The food...

10:21.955 --> 10:23.022
The crab cakes were good.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.057
Thanks.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.758
Yes?
That was the high point.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.560
Everything else unfortunately
for me

10:27.594 --> 10:28.728
was just too bland.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.000
Really?

10:30.000 --> 10:30.230
Really?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.531
The pancakes
were soggy

10:31.564 --> 10:32.632
and the fish
was dry.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.367
The salmon just--

10:34.400 --> 10:36.569
it just looked old-fashioned.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.838
Can I ask you
an honest question?

10:38.872 --> 10:40.640
Yes.
It was our ten-year anniversary.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.008
And we said for our ten-year
anniversary everybody

10:42.041 --> 10:43.009
gets complimentary
zucchini pancakes.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.511
Yes.
Now, everybody tells me
they love 'em.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.412
If you give something away,

10:46.446 --> 10:49.282
and it's free,
who's gonna complain about it?

10:49.315 --> 10:50.350
That never happens.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.219
So either he's crazy,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.188
or every customer that comes
in here is lying to me.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.890
I wanna come back
with a plan.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.459
And bang.
It didn't blow me away today.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.000
I wasn't that excited about it.
It's very average.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.561
I wasn't that excited about it.
It's very average.

11:01.594 --> 11:02.896
Very dreary.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.098
And it's very sad.
End of story.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.566
Okay?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.334
See you later, yes?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.837
It makes me feel terrible
when Gordon says

11:10.870 --> 11:12.805
he doesn't like
my husband's food.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.340
You know, of course I'm gonna
take offense to that.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.110
Gordon is wrong
about the restaurant.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.379
My position is the manager,

11:19.412 --> 11:20.847
so I am not intimidated
by anybody.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.215
Bring it on.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.885
Coming up:

11:25.919 --> 11:27.554
Gordon sees a sign of the times.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.956
Now accepting
dinner reservations?

11:29.989 --> 11:30.000
We thought maybe because we're
not taking reservations, so--

11:30.000 --> 11:32.058
We thought maybe because we're
not taking reservations, so--

11:32.091 --> 11:33.726
It's  empty.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.296
Lisa and Billy
must face the truth.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.765
Maybe we should close
this place down.

11:38.798 --> 11:41.267
And later as Gordon
turns up the heat...

11:41.301 --> 11:42.535
Can you wake up?

11:42.569 --> 11:44.137
Manager Mike loses it.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.706
I was told at 7:00 this morning.
That's it!

11:46.739 --> 11:48.074
Seriously, I'm pissed off!

11:48.107 --> 11:52.078
Do not talk to me
like that.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.479
- Hey.
- outside now.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.648
He's a freakin' lunatic.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.617
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.894
Later that night after meeting
the staff and sampling the food,

12:08.927 --> 12:11.263
Gordon wants
to observe a dinner service,

12:11.296 --> 12:13.098
so he can evaluate Billy
in the kitchen,

12:13.131 --> 12:14.711
and Mike in the front
of the house.

12:16.835 --> 12:17.936
Two or three people.

12:17.970 --> 12:20.472
Bloody hell..

12:20.505 --> 12:22.007
This is not very good right now.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.109
It is 7:00,
and there's a lot

12:24.142 --> 12:25.944
of open tables
in the restaurant.

12:25.978 --> 12:29.652
To me, I would have shut
the doors a year ago.

12:29.652 --> 12:30.148
To me, I would have shut
the doors a year ago.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.783
Wherever you feel like it.
It's your choice.

12:31.817 --> 12:32.818
How about this one?

12:32.851 --> 12:35.287
Why not?

12:35.320 --> 12:37.489
It's an hour
into the dinner service,

12:37.522 --> 12:38.657
and it's starting
to become clear to Gordon

12:38.690 --> 12:41.293
why The Mixing Bowl
is losing so much money.

12:41.326 --> 12:44.029
This coupon,
you can use it this evening.

12:44.062 --> 12:45.497
50% off.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.600
Your check is all adjusted.
Thank you very much.
Okay.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.339
We hand somebody a check.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.942
You put this 50% off coupon
in it.

12:56.975 --> 12:57.943
15?

12:57.976 --> 12:59.652
Fif--no, no,
5-0, 50.

12:59.652 --> 12:59.711
Fif--no, no,
5-0, 50.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.013
In here?

13:01.046 --> 13:02.047
Yeah.
50% off.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.049
Holy smoke.

13:06.885 --> 13:09.354
My goodness me.

13:12.557 --> 13:14.893
Mike just told me
about the coupon that he tried.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.495
How long have
you been doing it?

13:16.528 --> 13:18.864
Um, a long time.
Eight years.

13:18.897 --> 13:19.865
Eight years?

13:21.733 --> 13:23.135
That doesn't make sense now,
does it?

13:23.168 --> 13:26.004
No, it doesn't.

13:26.038 --> 13:27.806
Do you ever go out there?

13:27.839 --> 13:29.652
Um, yeah, when I--when it
dies down I'll walk around.

13:29.652 --> 13:33.679
Um, yeah, when I--when it
dies down I'll walk around.

13:33.712 --> 13:37.382
While Billy spends the entire
dinner service in the kitchen,

13:37.416 --> 13:38.884
the responsibility of running
the restaurant

13:38.917 --> 13:39.851
is in Mike's hands.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.054
Any more coupons?
Anywhere else?

13:42.087 --> 13:43.522
No, no, that's it.
You sure?

13:43.555 --> 13:46.325
Nothing at all?

13:48.727 --> 13:49.995
There is more.

13:50.028 --> 13:53.432
I have about ten signs
that I had made up.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.633
Go
and get them.

13:56.768 --> 13:58.437
Someone grab the door
for me, please.

13:58.470 --> 13:59.652
Sorry.

13:59.652 --> 14:03.141
Sorry.

14:05.377 --> 14:07.512
Sorry.

14:07.546 --> 14:12.451
Okay.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.653
All of 'em go in the window
at some point.

14:14.686 --> 14:17.055
Where did you get
all these from?

14:17.089 --> 14:18.790
I have a place.
They make 'em up for me.

14:18.824 --> 14:19.558
It was expensive.

14:19.591 --> 14:20.826
Holy mackerel.

14:20.859 --> 14:24.162
As you can see,
I've tried everything.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.163
Clearly.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.332
Now accepting reservations?

14:27.366 --> 14:29.334
We thought maybe because we're
not taking reservations,

14:29.368 --> 14:29.652
maybe people aren't coming
in here.

14:29.652 --> 14:32.104
maybe people aren't coming
in here.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.939
It's empty.

14:33.972 --> 14:35.007
Yes.
But we--

14:35.040 --> 14:36.808
It's  empty.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.544
Tuesday night dinner specials.
Select three.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.179
Three what?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.648
That was--that was one of the
worst things we've ever done.

14:43.682 --> 14:47.853
Um, so what we did, uh, select
three was--it was a while ago.

14:47.886 --> 14:48.854
We did, um...

14:48.887 --> 14:50.188
And that's a pumpkin.

14:50.222 --> 14:51.656
Can I--can I--
can I tell you what

14:51.690 --> 14:53.291
because--
Listen to this.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.360
Order your
Thanksgiving desserts early.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.729
Yes.
In case we're closed by the time
we come round to November.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.398
What I do is I--
I'll put up a sign

14:59.431 --> 14:59.652
a month ahead of time

14:59.652 --> 15:01.166
a month ahead of time

15:01.199 --> 15:02.901
because maybe people will
drive by and say, "Oh, look--"

15:02.934 --> 15:04.736
Which sign was
the most successful?

15:08.040 --> 15:10.075
None.
None.

15:10.108 --> 15:12.310
Is there anything else
that I should know?

15:12.344 --> 15:14.546
That's, uh,
that's it.

15:14.579 --> 15:15.881
That is it?

15:15.914 --> 15:17.682
Well, there's--
well--

15:17.716 --> 15:20.252
Oh, no.

15:20.285 --> 15:21.953
There was--there was...
Oh, no.

15:21.987 --> 15:24.589
It's not really
that big of a deal.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.458
Gordon!
Can you come here?

15:26.491 --> 15:27.459
It's a little big.

15:27.492 --> 15:29.652
What in the?

15:29.652 --> 15:29.895
What in the?

15:29.928 --> 15:32.064
Free appetizer with dinner.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.167
Oh,.
Man, get me out of here.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.171
Jesus Christ.

15:39.204 --> 15:40.172
Where in the--

15:40.205 --> 15:41.440
Here--here, it's--

15:41.473 --> 15:42.874
It went over the--
it went over the--

15:42.908 --> 15:45.010
These other little signs
weren't working.

15:45.043 --> 15:47.012
And how long do
the signs go up for?

15:47.045 --> 15:49.481
Well, it would have still
been up, but there was, uh,

15:49.514 --> 15:50.916
a bad windstorm
a few months ago,

15:50.949 --> 15:52.017
and it ripped it down.

15:52.050 --> 15:52.951
It blew the signs down?

15:52.984 --> 15:53.952
Yes.
So we--

15:53.985 --> 15:55.654
Thank  for that.

15:55.687 --> 15:57.055
Doesn't this catch your eye
though, from the street?

15:57.089 --> 15:57.556
Catch my eye?

15:57.589 --> 15:58.924
Isn't that the point?

15:58.957 --> 15:59.652
It's  worse
than a dumb shop.

15:59.652 --> 16:00.859
It's  worse
than a dumb shop.

16:00.892 --> 16:02.694
You're incredible.

16:02.727 --> 16:04.963
Okay, get the signs
and put them back round here.

16:04.996 --> 16:07.999
I don't want
any customers to see it.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.168
I've got a restaurateur
who's just a cook--

16:10.202 --> 16:11.536
a simple cook--

16:11.570 --> 16:13.672
a manager totally obsessed
by his signs,

16:13.705 --> 16:17.142
and a wife that'd rather close
the place down tonight.

16:17.175 --> 16:22.447
This is a real nightmare.
My God.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.983
After a day of observation,

16:25.016 --> 16:26.952
Gordon is ready
to confront Billy and Lisa

16:26.985 --> 16:29.652
with the harsh reality.

16:29.652 --> 16:30.021
with the harsh reality.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.858
I've got to be  brutally
honest with you, you know that.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.459
I've seen a lot today.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.328
Watched the service.

16:36.361 --> 16:38.530
Unfortunately I spent a lot
of time talking to Mike.

16:38.563 --> 16:39.931
And, uh, yeah, he's, uh--

16:39.965 --> 16:42.334
He's out there that one, huh?

16:42.367 --> 16:44.903
You seriously have to start
thinking as a businessman.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.771
Not leaving it
to someone like Michael

16:46.805 --> 16:49.274
to sort of focus
on the bologna and bull.

16:49.307 --> 16:51.143
And then watching you
cooking.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.612
I've never ever seen a chef

16:53.645 --> 16:57.282
so quiet in all my life.

16:57.315 --> 16:59.351
You look like a man that's dying
to be put out of his misery.

16:59.384 --> 16:59.652
Lisa, you may be right.

16:59.652 --> 17:01.686
Lisa, you may be right.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.688
To put you out of your misery,

17:03.722 --> 17:06.024
maybe we should close
this place down.

17:06.057 --> 17:07.459
tonight.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.297
Up next:

17:12.330 --> 17:14.166
There is mutiny
at The Mixing Bowl.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.400
I think he's lazy.

17:15.433 --> 17:17.636
The rest of us
bust our butts

17:17.669 --> 17:19.838
to get your tables
and our tables done,

17:19.871 --> 17:22.040
and then you take
a half, like, of our tips.

17:22.073 --> 17:23.642
Do you think we would have
those tips if I wasn't here?

17:23.675 --> 17:25.810
And later before Billy steps up:

17:25.844 --> 17:28.613
I was told at 7:00 this morning!
That's it!

17:28.647 --> 17:29.652
Seriously, I'm pissed off!

17:29.652 --> 17:30.248
Seriously, I'm pissed off!

17:30.282 --> 17:31.483
I don't want him to talk
to my wife that way.

17:31.516 --> 17:33.852
Do not talk to me like that.

17:33.885 --> 17:35.420
Gordon steps in.

17:35.453 --> 17:37.556
- Hey.
- Take your  outside now.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.593
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.036
After the dinner service,

17:52.069 --> 17:53.771
Gordon decides to test
Billy and Lisa's commitment

17:53.804 --> 17:54.839
to the restaurant.

17:54.872 --> 17:56.740
Lisa,
you may be right.

17:56.774 --> 17:58.742
To put you out
of your misery

17:58.776 --> 18:01.045
maybe you should close
this place down

18:01.078 --> 18:04.615
tonight.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.351
The stress and the pressure
relieved, bang.

18:07.384 --> 18:08.652
You'd be gone
within 12 hours.

18:11.789 --> 18:13.896
I don't want him
to give up his dream.

18:13.896 --> 18:14.758
I don't want him
to give up his dream.

18:14.792 --> 18:17.895
But I don't see why
we keep going with it.

18:17.928 --> 18:19.230
Billy's a good person.

18:19.263 --> 18:21.165
He doesn't want
to just walk away.

18:21.198 --> 18:23.200
But if he has
to close the doors,

18:23.234 --> 18:25.236
it needs to be closed then,
and let's move on already.

18:25.269 --> 18:29.707
I wanna live a normal life.

18:29.740 --> 18:33.210
This is where you
really seriously dig deep.

18:33.244 --> 18:35.946
If the restaurant dies,

18:35.980 --> 18:37.314
it'll be like a death
in the family.

18:37.348 --> 18:39.216
We have to go forward.

18:42.620 --> 18:43.896
Seriously?
Yeah.

18:43.896 --> 18:44.922
Seriously?
Yeah.

18:44.955 --> 18:48.325
If you seriously,
seriously want to continue,

18:48.359 --> 18:50.961
you have got
to find your passion

18:50.995 --> 18:52.997
with your support.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.565
And truthfully,
unless you change,

18:54.598 --> 18:57.735
you'll be gone
in six weeks time.

19:05.376 --> 19:10.614
It's day two and time for Gordon
to start implementing his plan.

19:10.648 --> 19:12.182
He hopes to get through
to manager Mike

19:12.216 --> 19:13.896
about his destructive promotions

19:13.896 --> 19:14.718
about his destructive promotions

19:14.752 --> 19:17.588
with the help of a somewhat
destructive measure.

19:20.991 --> 19:22.660
It looks like
a wood chipper to me.

19:22.693 --> 19:23.928
That's right.

19:23.961 --> 19:25.763
It's time to say good-bye
to the past.

19:25.796 --> 19:29.400
It's time to say good-bye
to Valentine's Day.

19:33.337 --> 19:35.139
Bloody hell.

19:40.344 --> 19:41.946
Yeah, I am  mad.

19:41.979 --> 19:43.896
Working with guys like you
makes me  mad.

19:43.896 --> 19:45.616
Working with guys like you
makes me  mad.

19:45.649 --> 19:48.719
With Gordon struggling
to get through to Mike,

19:48.752 --> 19:50.654
he now turns his attention

19:50.688 --> 19:53.023
to The Mixing Bowl's
greatest challenge.

19:53.057 --> 19:56.160
Let's have a look
at 1997 first.

19:56.193 --> 19:59.763
One, two, three,
four restaurants.

19:59.797 --> 20:01.265
Wow.

20:01.298 --> 20:02.733
Ten years ago,

20:02.766 --> 20:05.336
let me show you something.

20:05.369 --> 20:08.505
2007.

20:08.539 --> 20:10.040
Holy.

20:10.074 --> 20:11.842
Look how built up
this neighborhood has become

20:11.875 --> 20:12.910
over the last ten years.

20:12.943 --> 20:13.896
41 restaurants.

20:13.896 --> 20:15.045
41 restaurants.

20:15.079 --> 20:18.282
From a Chinese to a deli
to a pizza to a diner.

20:18.315 --> 20:19.450
Right now we need

20:19.483 --> 20:21.485
to re-position The Mixing Bowl

20:21.518 --> 20:23.687
smack bang in the middle
of all that competition.

20:23.721 --> 20:26.991
Gordon's right.
41 restaurants.

20:27.024 --> 20:29.126
Of course you're gonna kinda
get lost in the shuffle.

20:29.159 --> 20:31.028
What else is
around this area?

20:31.061 --> 20:32.096
You go to every day?

20:32.129 --> 20:33.364
Oh, the gym.

20:33.397 --> 20:36.133
Gyms, beauty parlors,
tanning salon.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.335
What isn't on there?

20:38.369 --> 20:39.770
A healthier?

20:39.803 --> 20:41.238
Healthy is something

20:41.271 --> 20:43.607
that's not even listed
anywhere near here.

20:43.640 --> 20:43.896
One way we can help
turn this around is

20:43.896 --> 20:47.111
One way we can help
turn this around is

20:47.144 --> 20:51.582
by installing something
to do with health.

20:51.615 --> 20:53.817
It's exciting to realize
you can do things healthy.

20:53.851 --> 20:55.419
And it just opened my eyes
to a whole new world.

20:55.452 --> 20:57.654
Give the  neighborhood
what they want.

21:02.459 --> 21:04.528
With the mixing bowl
now embracing

21:04.561 --> 21:06.497
being the healthy,
high-quality restaurant

21:06.530 --> 21:09.666
of Bellmore,
Gordon also realizes he needs

21:09.700 --> 21:11.268
to ignite Billy's passion.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.537
Time to be competitive.

21:13.570 --> 21:13.896
Creative.
Yeah?

21:13.896 --> 21:14.872
Creative.
Yeah?

21:14.905 --> 21:17.608
Our list of 15 ingredients.
Okay?

21:17.641 --> 21:19.176
Half an hour.

21:19.209 --> 21:20.711
You work there.
I'll work there.

21:20.744 --> 21:22.546
Keep it fresh and healthy.

21:22.579 --> 21:24.248
Think about the direction
of the restaurant,

21:24.281 --> 21:25.249
the way it's going, yes?

21:25.282 --> 21:26.250
Okay?

21:26.283 --> 21:28.952
Gordon Ramsay teaching Billy.

21:28.986 --> 21:31.155
He's being trained by one
of the top chefs in the world.

21:33.924 --> 21:35.692
I was totally
into what I was doing.

21:35.726 --> 21:37.161
But then you realize
that's Gordon Ramsay

21:37.194 --> 21:38.328
working next to you.

21:38.362 --> 21:41.932
It was great.

21:47.471 --> 21:48.839
I was so excited

21:48.872 --> 21:50.841
because I haven't seen Billy
this fired up

21:50.874 --> 21:52.376
about something in so long.

21:52.409 --> 21:53.877
You're very quiet there,
my man.

21:53.911 --> 21:55.412
Now what is it with you?

21:55.446 --> 21:57.414
You must drive Lisa
around the bend, you know that.

21:57.448 --> 21:59.450
How do you communicate?
Through email?

21:59.483 --> 22:01.452
I wasn't paying attention
to what he was doing at all.

22:01.485 --> 22:03.654
I was more involved
in just making my dish.

22:07.391 --> 22:10.427
Up, up, up and away.

22:10.461 --> 22:12.329
Billy finished first.

22:12.362 --> 22:13.896
Okay good.
So yours is a--?

22:13.896 --> 22:14.198
Okay good.
So yours is a--?

22:14.231 --> 22:18.302
Seared salmon
with ginger-balsamic drizzle.

22:18.335 --> 22:20.070
This is a poached salmon,

22:20.104 --> 22:21.705
and I've just poached
with vegetable stock.

22:21.738 --> 22:23.841
Top with a, uh, walnut pesto.

22:23.874 --> 22:25.809
Everything looked really nice,

22:25.843 --> 22:28.112
just fresh and lively
and vibrant

22:28.145 --> 22:29.980
and the food kinda, like,
jumped out at you.

22:30.013 --> 22:31.048
It looked great.

22:31.081 --> 22:33.250
This is the kind
of food

22:33.283 --> 22:35.385
that The Mixing Bowl
should be serving.

22:35.419 --> 22:36.854
I like that.

22:36.887 --> 22:38.822
Both dishes are good enough
to go on the menu tonight.

22:38.856 --> 22:42.025
I like the food,
but I really don't know

22:42.059 --> 22:43.896
if Gordon can change
this place around.

22:43.896 --> 22:44.761
if Gordon can change
this place around.

22:51.301 --> 22:55.739
With word that world-class
Chef Ramsay is in town,

22:55.772 --> 22:57.341
The Mixing Bowl
is busier than normal

22:57.374 --> 22:58.976
for tonight's dinner service.

22:59.009 --> 23:01.011
Do you have reservations
this evening?

23:01.044 --> 23:02.980
But can the staff
at The Mixing Bowl

23:03.013 --> 23:04.815
actually cope
with a busy restaurant?

23:04.848 --> 23:06.049
Push the salmon, please.
Yeah?

23:06.083 --> 23:07.084
Okay.
Okay.

23:07.117 --> 23:08.852
Push the salmon special,
yeah?

23:08.886 --> 23:09.853
I think that the customers
are absolutely gonna love

23:09.887 --> 23:11.021
the new salmon dish.

23:11.054 --> 23:12.122
Push the salmon.

23:12.156 --> 23:13.790
Table of four--
don't point.

23:13.824 --> 23:13.896
Don't point at customers.

23:13.896 --> 23:15.459
Don't point at customers.

23:15.492 --> 23:19.730
We're running a restaurant,
not a  zoo.

23:19.763 --> 23:20.964
Did you get
the salmon special?

23:20.998 --> 23:22.099
Yeah.
Okay, good.

23:22.132 --> 23:23.734
Let's take 12 out.
Let's take 12 out.

23:23.767 --> 23:25.235
Do you like salmon?
I would try salmon.

23:25.269 --> 23:27.004
Three salmon specials.

23:27.037 --> 23:28.205
Good.
They're selling the salmon.

23:28.238 --> 23:30.073
Good.

23:30.107 --> 23:32.643
Hey, Yvonne.
How you doing, sweetie?

23:32.676 --> 23:35.112
I don't particularly care
about the kitchen.

23:35.145 --> 23:37.147
Your main focus
should be the customers.

23:37.181 --> 23:39.850
The water is complimentary.

23:46.190 --> 23:47.991
Salmon special
is really going well.

23:48.025 --> 23:50.194
But Michael,
what the  is he doing?

23:50.227 --> 23:54.164
This guy is just  using
this restaurant to feed his ego.

23:54.198 --> 23:56.667
I'm glad you guys
are enjoying everything.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.702
You want your friends
to come in, that's great,

23:58.735 --> 24:00.804
but you should be out working.

24:00.837 --> 24:02.306
Answer the phone, please.

24:02.339 --> 24:04.141
It's impossible
to work with him.

24:04.174 --> 24:06.143
And every time
you work with him,

24:06.176 --> 24:07.711
he takes half of your tips.

24:07.744 --> 24:09.913
Kimmy, you gotta work
the tips, baby.

24:09.947 --> 24:11.715
I get very large tips.

24:11.748 --> 24:13.650
Give 'em some more water
on table 18, please.

24:13.684 --> 24:13.896
I mean, 20-25%

24:13.896 --> 24:16.320
I mean, 20-25%

24:16.353 --> 24:18.488
Could you do it?
Put on another round of drinks.

24:18.522 --> 24:21.024
Another Bud--another Bud and
another Diet Coke also.

24:21.058 --> 24:24.795
I am tired of Mike taking half
the money from the tip cup.

24:24.828 --> 24:25.829
It's not fair.

24:25.862 --> 24:27.297
Good-bye.
Thank you.

24:27.331 --> 24:30.634
Thank you.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.270
Despite the success
of the new specials,

24:33.303 --> 24:35.239
the staff is unhappy
with their tips.

24:35.272 --> 24:37.874
And all fingers
are pointing toward Mike.

24:37.908 --> 24:40.844
You find a table, you latch on
and then the rest of us

24:40.877 --> 24:43.896
bust our butts to get
your tables and our tables done,

24:43.896 --> 24:44.448
bust our butts to get
your tables and our tables done,

24:44.481 --> 24:46.216
and then you take a half,
like, of our tips.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.051
Can I--can I say something?

24:48.085 --> 24:52.256
Do you think you'd have
those tips if I wasn't here?

24:52.289 --> 24:54.558
When people come in here,
everybody knows me.

24:54.591 --> 24:56.493
The customers know me.
All you guys know that.

24:56.526 --> 24:58.128
People know me the best

24:58.161 --> 24:59.997
because I make it a point
to making friends

25:00.030 --> 25:01.431
with the customers,
and that's what customers want.

25:01.465 --> 25:02.666
They wanna feel special.

25:02.699 --> 25:04.034
Mike thinks
this is his restaurant.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.836
He is an employee here.

25:05.869 --> 25:09.039
unbelievable.

25:09.072 --> 25:10.340
Okay, time to get real.

25:10.374 --> 25:12.009
When I ask you
to wake up

25:12.042 --> 25:13.810
in terms of running
the  business,

25:13.844 --> 25:13.896
sometimes you run it
as if you own the place.

25:13.896 --> 25:15.979
sometimes you run it
as if you own the place.

25:16.013 --> 25:17.481
And the reason why

25:17.514 --> 25:19.016
you do that is because,

25:19.049 --> 25:21.652
Billy, you are too weak.

25:21.685 --> 25:25.555
And Lisa, if it sounds crap,
open up and say it.

25:25.589 --> 25:27.524
He's nervous that
everybody's sitting out there

25:27.557 --> 25:29.192
with their thumbs
up their

25:29.226 --> 25:30.727
not doing what they're supposed
to be doing.

25:30.761 --> 25:32.296
See, I don't think right now
that's the right attitude.

25:32.329 --> 25:33.730
I think we should have
a positive attitude.

25:33.764 --> 25:34.898
But I mean, be realistic.

25:34.931 --> 25:37.034
When I'm bussing my own tables,

25:37.067 --> 25:40.003
and everybody else is running
around crazy.

25:40.037 --> 25:43.273
We are aware
of what the problems were.

25:43.307 --> 25:43.896
And I think
that we should move forward

25:43.896 --> 25:46.009
And I think
that we should move forward

25:46.043 --> 25:47.778
and put the damn past
behind us.

25:47.811 --> 25:49.146
You're kinda talkin'
to yourself right now.

25:49.179 --> 25:51.214
I'm talking--this is how I feel.

25:51.248 --> 25:54.551
I'm not even--
These are things
you need to do.

25:54.584 --> 25:58.488
I'm fighting for my life here.

25:58.522 --> 25:59.623
You right now need

25:59.656 --> 26:00.624
to step up
to the plate

26:00.657 --> 26:02.459
and make the changes

26:02.492 --> 26:04.461
every frickin' day,
every minute of the day.

26:04.494 --> 26:07.097
That's it.

26:07.130 --> 26:13.003
Billy, that's the first time
you've sounded like a boss.

26:13.036 --> 26:13.896
"Cause it's your  life
on the line.

26:13.896 --> 26:15.806
"Cause it's your  life
on the line.

26:15.839 --> 26:17.874
Don't ever forget that.

26:17.908 --> 26:19.710
Hey, he's laughing again.

26:19.743 --> 26:22.646
If you're carrying the weight
that this guy and his wife

26:22.679 --> 26:23.914
has on their shoulders,

26:23.947 --> 26:28.719
you wouldn't  smirk.

26:28.752 --> 26:31.054
Tomorrow, the most important day
in ten years.

26:31.088 --> 26:32.889
We're gonna implement changes

26:32.923 --> 26:34.725
to help get this business
turned around.

26:34.758 --> 26:37.160
If this doesn't work
after tomorrow,

26:37.194 --> 26:41.598
the blame is
on your shoulders, Mike.

26:41.631 --> 26:42.833
Still to come...

26:42.866 --> 26:43.896
Let's get it, boys.

26:43.896 --> 26:44.234
Let's get it, boys.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.336
The Mixing Bowl
is busier than ever.

26:46.370 --> 26:47.671
Pick up this plate!
Let's go!

26:47.704 --> 26:48.638
Can I get the three soups?

26:48.672 --> 26:49.773
The order.
Now!

26:49.806 --> 26:51.241
It's coming now,
you.

26:51.274 --> 26:52.976
I was just fed up.

26:53.009 --> 26:54.778
But nobody's
in the mood for celebrating.

26:54.811 --> 26:56.046
I was told 7:00 this morning!

26:56.079 --> 26:57.347
That's it!

26:57.381 --> 26:58.949
It's the dinner service

26:58.982 --> 27:00.917
you have to see to believe.

27:00.951 --> 27:02.152
Seriously, I'm pissed off.

27:02.185 --> 27:03.487
Do not talk to me like that.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.955
It's done!

27:04.988 --> 27:06.923
Coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

27:12.272 --> 27:14.274
Day three.

27:14.308 --> 27:16.110
Gordon's design team
works overnight.

27:16.143 --> 27:17.578
and transforms
The Mixing Bowl

27:17.611 --> 27:20.080
from a non-descript diner

27:20.114 --> 27:23.017
into a contemporary,
sleek restaurant.

27:23.050 --> 27:25.486
And now it's time
to be revealed.

27:25.519 --> 27:26.487
All right.
Ready?

27:26.520 --> 27:27.488
Yes?
Mike?

27:27.521 --> 27:28.789
Ready?

27:28.822 --> 27:33.293
I'm so excited to see,
like, what--you know.

27:33.327 --> 27:34.695
I'm psyched.

27:34.728 --> 27:35.996
The place needs a facelift,

27:36.030 --> 27:37.531
so I'm very excited to see it.

27:37.564 --> 27:38.532
Let's go.

27:38.565 --> 27:39.027
Lovely.

27:39.027 --> 27:39.833
Lovely.

27:39.867 --> 27:40.934
Here we go.

27:40.968 --> 27:43.303
Oh, my goodness.

27:43.337 --> 27:44.805
Oh, my God.

27:44.838 --> 27:46.740
Oh, wow.

27:46.774 --> 27:49.343
It's gorgeous.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.546
Oh, my God, I--oh.

27:52.579 --> 27:53.614
Genius.
Yes?

28:00.054 --> 28:02.589
It looks nice, huh?

28:02.623 --> 28:04.992
Beautiful.
This is gorgeous.

28:05.025 --> 28:07.361
I feel like I wanna spend money
in here.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.027
It's exciting to walk out
into the dining room

28:09.027 --> 28:09.763
It's exciting to walk out
into the dining room

28:09.797 --> 28:11.598
and just see
what it looks like.

28:11.632 --> 28:13.834
The decor was terrible.

28:13.867 --> 28:16.970
Now I think the decor works.
It fits with the food.

28:17.004 --> 28:18.338
It fits with the name.

28:18.372 --> 28:19.840
Lisa, what do you think
of the chairs?

28:19.873 --> 28:21.675
Oh, my God.
I love them.

28:21.708 --> 28:23.077
Have a seat in one of them.

28:26.046 --> 28:27.114
Lisa.

28:27.147 --> 28:28.916
Oh, my God.

28:28.949 --> 28:30.084
It's amazing.

28:30.117 --> 28:31.518
It just was like a gift.

28:31.552 --> 28:33.187
It was just like
a period of grace.

28:33.220 --> 28:35.222
It really touched me deeply.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.457
It looks like a restaurant now,
doesn't it?

28:36.490 --> 28:37.491
Yes.

28:37.524 --> 28:39.026
Are you seriously
gonna start spending time

28:39.059 --> 28:40.127
in your own restaurant now?

28:40.160 --> 28:41.962
Say hello to customers?
Yep.

28:41.995 --> 28:43.397
Kim, how do you feel,
darlin'?

28:43.430 --> 28:45.199
It looks completely different.

28:45.232 --> 28:47.201
I feel so much better
about coming here,

28:47.234 --> 28:49.036
knowing that they're not looking
around thinking,

28:49.069 --> 28:52.873
"Why am I sitting here with this
gross paper on my table?"

28:55.576 --> 28:57.211
It's gorgeous.

28:57.244 --> 28:58.745
I can't wait
for customers to come.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.582
Sorry.

29:01.615 --> 29:03.217
I can't wait for customers
to come in and see the place.

29:04.518 --> 29:05.519
Lisa, do you have any tissues?

29:05.552 --> 29:08.789
Hey.

29:08.822 --> 29:09.027
This is our new start.

29:09.027 --> 29:10.157
This is our new start.

29:10.190 --> 29:13.327
So hopefully
it's what we needed.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.195
It's unbelievable.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.469
With the new decor
as the inspiration

29:22.503 --> 29:24.438
it's time for Gordon
to overhaul the menu.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.973
Okay, first salad.

29:26.006 --> 29:28.075
Apple and endive, um,
salad, yes?

29:28.108 --> 29:30.577
And it's done with walnuts
and a honey-dijon dressing.

29:30.611 --> 29:33.614
It's very fresh, very good,
very citrus-y, very tangy.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.082
Gordon woke me up.

29:35.115 --> 29:36.617
He got me back
to what's now and just trying

29:36.650 --> 29:38.418
to put that together.

29:38.452 --> 29:39.027
Under Gordon's direction,
The Mixing Bowl

29:39.027 --> 29:40.921
Under Gordon's direction,
The Mixing Bowl

29:40.954 --> 29:43.490
has removed
heavily-sauced entrees

29:43.524 --> 29:46.226
and replaced them
with healthy, vibrant items.

29:46.260 --> 29:47.895
Roasted vine tomato soup,
slow-roasted in the oven,

29:47.928 --> 29:49.096
overnight.

29:49.129 --> 29:50.664
Blended and finished

29:50.697 --> 29:52.199
with fresh basil
and drizzled olive oil.

29:52.232 --> 29:53.700
Tuna Nicoise
that's been addressed

29:53.734 --> 29:55.469
with an olive tapenade.

29:55.502 --> 29:59.339
Green beans, olives, eggs,
and roasted new potatoes.

29:59.373 --> 30:02.009
We got to see the way
all the new dishes looked.

30:02.042 --> 30:03.210
They looked beautiful.

30:03.243 --> 30:06.780
Smaller portions, lighter foods.

30:06.813 --> 30:07.981
All of it made sense.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.027
Good--right, are we ready?

30:09.027 --> 30:09.249
Good--right, are we ready?

30:09.283 --> 30:10.250
Yeah.

30:10.284 --> 30:11.885
Good luck.

30:11.919 --> 30:13.887
I love the menu because I was
eating all the food in here,

30:13.921 --> 30:15.622
so now I'm eating
a little bit healthier.

30:15.656 --> 30:18.292
It may, uh--it may have
an impact on my, uh, belly.

30:18.325 --> 30:22.663
With a healthy new menu
and the restaurant redesigned,

30:22.696 --> 30:25.165
it's time to utilize
the staff's new energy

30:25.199 --> 30:27.334
and spread the word
about The new Mixing Bowl.

30:27.367 --> 30:30.871
We'll go out to a spa or a gym,
just put the word out.

30:30.904 --> 30:32.639
A fresh outlook.
A fresh appeal.

30:32.673 --> 30:34.441
My God, look at these.
Hi, guys.

30:34.474 --> 30:36.176
You all know where
The Mixing Bowl is, right?

30:36.210 --> 30:37.277
That's the restaurant there,
The Mixing Bowl.

30:37.311 --> 30:38.812
We're gonna be kicking off

30:38.845 --> 30:39.027
our new, light,
vibrant, healthy menu.

30:39.027 --> 30:40.814
our new, light,
vibrant, healthy menu.

30:40.847 --> 30:42.249
Exciting new food.

30:42.282 --> 30:44.084
It'd be great to see you.

30:44.117 --> 30:45.619
At The Mixing Bowl Eatery
in Bellmore.

30:45.652 --> 30:46.620
New decor.
New menu.

30:46.653 --> 30:48.188
New style.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.456
Gordon.

30:49.489 --> 30:52.392
Gordon, I'm burning
1700 calories per hour.

30:52.426 --> 30:55.162
If Billy could see you
right now--

30:55.195 --> 30:57.531
Not bad for a fat guy, huh?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.534
I brought you here
for a wake-up call, yeah.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.669
Let's go.
Holy...

31:02.703 --> 31:05.005
In keeping with the healthy
direction of the restaurant,

31:05.038 --> 31:06.707
Gordon has reached out
to the New York Dragons'

31:06.740 --> 31:08.508
arena football team
to create

31:08.542 --> 31:09.027
some buzz
in the community.

31:09.027 --> 31:10.477
some buzz
in the community.

31:10.510 --> 31:12.246
It's a big day
for us tomorrow.

31:12.279 --> 31:15.315
So, um, we wanna
help celebrate that

31:15.349 --> 31:17.217
and, uh, maybe getting you down
to the restaurant and, uh,

31:17.251 --> 31:18.118
come in and have a bite to eat.

31:18.151 --> 31:19.920
I think
it's an amazing idea.

31:19.953 --> 31:22.155
I just hope it works.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.368
Day four.

31:34.401 --> 31:36.603
Only a short time
before re-launch.

31:36.637 --> 31:38.739
And Mike is
already feeling the heat.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.027
There's a couple of little,
tiny things that bother me

31:39.027 --> 31:41.608
There's a couple of little,
tiny things that bother me

31:41.642 --> 31:43.644
'cause I want--I want the place
to look perfect.

31:43.677 --> 31:44.911
Mixing Bowl, Mike speaking.
Can I help you?

31:44.945 --> 31:46.813
How many people
are you gonna be?

31:46.847 --> 31:48.682
There was a lot of confusion
with the reservations.

31:48.715 --> 31:50.684
And it was a lot of things
I really had to do myself.

31:50.717 --> 31:52.519
Disgusting..

31:52.552 --> 31:53.854
He was having a hard time today,

31:53.887 --> 31:55.555
which we all were, you know,

31:55.589 --> 31:56.757
but he really lost it.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.426
Actually takes some thought!

31:59.459 --> 32:00.427
See, this is why

32:00.460 --> 32:01.428
we need Xanax.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.764
Mike seemed so stressed.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.899
And I was definitely concerned

32:05.932 --> 32:07.434
that it wasn't going
to help us

32:07.467 --> 32:09.027
when we open the doors.

32:09.027 --> 32:09.236
when we open the doors.

32:09.269 --> 32:11.238
That's it.

32:11.271 --> 32:12.205
That's it.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.577
With the re-launch
only minutes away,

32:17.611 --> 32:21.148
everything seems to be in place
for the big night.

32:21.181 --> 32:23.216
It looks like we have 47.

32:23.250 --> 32:24.985
And the restaurant
is fully-booked.

32:25.018 --> 32:26.286
Okay.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.522
Good luck.
Yes?

32:28.555 --> 32:29.790
Let's go, big boy.

32:33.126 --> 32:34.628
The customers
are cuing up to get in here.

32:37.864 --> 32:39.027
In his panic Mike has booked
too many people

32:39.027 --> 32:40.100
In his panic Mike has booked
too many people

32:40.133 --> 32:41.468
to arrive at the same time.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.670
Oh, no.

32:43.704 --> 32:45.672
Even I'm getting a little bit
dolally.

32:45.706 --> 32:47.441
There will be a van

32:47.474 --> 32:49.109
picking me up in a minute
with a  straight-jacket.

32:49.142 --> 32:50.644
I was not--

32:50.677 --> 32:52.179
This is huge.

32:52.212 --> 32:54.047
madness.

33:00.188 --> 33:02.423
It's The Mixing Bowl's
biggest night.

33:02.457 --> 33:05.593
And because of Mike's
reservation mix-up,

33:05.626 --> 33:08.096
many of the customers have
arrived at the same time.

33:08.129 --> 33:10.131
How you doing?
How's everything?

33:10.164 --> 33:12.867
As soon as those doors opened,
the floodgates opened up,

33:12.900 --> 33:14.402
and everybody kind of
came at once.

33:14.435 --> 33:15.503
It was a little bit stressful.

33:16.771 --> 33:18.072
Mike.
Yes.

33:18.106 --> 33:19.107
Mike, come over.

33:19.140 --> 33:20.208
Coming.

33:20.241 --> 33:21.609
Okay, reservations.

33:21.642 --> 33:23.644
What's the hiccup?

33:23.678 --> 33:26.074
I handed over the reservation
list to Kim.

33:26.074 --> 33:26.614
I handed over the reservation
list to Kim.

33:26.647 --> 33:29.350
And then I'm not exactly sure
what transpired since then.

33:29.383 --> 33:32.453
Mike tried to blame
the reservation mix-up on me.

33:32.487 --> 33:33.955
I've never been the one
in charge of the reservations.

33:33.988 --> 33:35.490
It's not fair.

33:35.523 --> 33:38.392
Mike  up
this whole seating thing.

33:38.426 --> 33:39.894
This is a big night.

33:39.927 --> 33:42.263
I cannot tell you
how big this night is.

33:42.296 --> 33:43.798
And you've gotta know
what's coming in.

33:43.831 --> 33:44.999
That's your job.

33:45.032 --> 33:47.068
It's not solely my fault.

33:47.101 --> 33:48.736
And I don't think
that it's right

33:48.770 --> 33:50.204
to put blame
on any one person.

33:50.238 --> 33:51.506
Can we get on?
Yes.

33:51.539 --> 33:52.640
And work as a team.

33:52.673 --> 33:53.708
Yes.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.074
God!

33:56.074 --> 33:56.077
God!

33:56.110 --> 33:58.780
After Gordon's pep talk,
Lynn, Kim, and Lisa

33:58.813 --> 34:01.082
all stepped in
to help get everyone seated.

34:02.450 --> 34:03.584
It's a totally
different menu.

34:03.618 --> 34:04.519
What would you like?

34:05.720 --> 34:07.388
Seared tuna.

34:07.421 --> 34:08.890
Okay.

34:08.923 --> 34:11.125
With the dining room now
completely full

34:11.159 --> 34:13.694
for the first time in years,
the pressure was turned up

34:13.728 --> 34:14.996
on The Mixing Bowl staff.

34:15.029 --> 34:16.731
Mike, you had
table five?

34:19.033 --> 34:21.803
Lynn, are you telling him
to bring a bus pan?

34:21.836 --> 34:23.404
Madame, let me take that
for you, please.

34:23.437 --> 34:24.138
Thank you very much indeed.

34:24.172 --> 34:25.673
Can you wake up?
Wake up.

34:25.706 --> 34:26.074
This is our one shot

34:26.074 --> 34:27.742
This is our one shot

34:27.775 --> 34:29.277
to make our lasting impression.

34:29.310 --> 34:31.078
We're gonna blow it.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.181
How long on the appetizers
on table five?

34:34.415 --> 34:35.850
I'm coming.

34:35.883 --> 34:37.585
Honestly I think that Mike's job
is not that hard.

34:37.618 --> 34:40.121
He just gets sidetracked

34:40.154 --> 34:42.924
and stops,
stops being a manager.

34:44.959 --> 34:47.562
While each waiter is covering
three to four tables...

34:47.595 --> 34:48.763
All right, so let me go ask.

34:48.796 --> 34:50.198
You can try ours.

34:50.231 --> 34:52.767
Mike is looking
after his friends.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.769
Can I get the three soups?
I need soups.

34:54.802 --> 34:55.970
Soup bowls.

34:56.003 --> 34:56.074
Yeah, it's coming now,
you.

34:56.074 --> 34:58.172
Yeah, it's coming now,
you.

34:58.206 --> 35:00.174
Watch your back.
Watch your back.

35:00.208 --> 35:02.677
I was definitely concerned
Mike was gonna crumble.

35:02.710 --> 35:04.412
He's not used to running

35:04.445 --> 35:06.113
a  busy dining room
out there, you know that.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.816
Yeah.
My God!

35:13.521 --> 35:14.622
Ooh!

35:14.655 --> 35:17.024
Oh, my God.

35:18.526 --> 35:20.695
It's two hours
into dinner service,

35:20.728 --> 35:23.297
and The Mixing Bowl has
weathered the first storm.

35:23.331 --> 35:26.074
But they are about to be faced
with another challenge.

35:26.074 --> 35:26.267
But they are about to be faced
with another challenge.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.335
The New York Dragons.

35:35.443 --> 35:37.144
Hi.
How are you?

35:37.178 --> 35:38.346
You're gonna have
a nice dinner?

35:38.379 --> 35:39.180
Sure hope so.

35:39.213 --> 35:40.481
Okay.

35:40.514 --> 35:41.983
So we're just gonna get
your tables together.

35:42.016 --> 35:43.384
Sounds good.
Okay?

35:43.417 --> 35:44.452
All right,
we'll be right with you.

35:44.485 --> 35:47.622
You wanna get that?

35:47.655 --> 35:49.624
Wait a minute.
I thought that

35:49.657 --> 35:52.093
that table was gonna be
with them.

35:52.126 --> 35:55.029
Can I see this?

35:55.062 --> 35:56.074
You forgot the biggest thing
to put on the list,

35:56.074 --> 35:58.666
You forgot the biggest thing
to put on the list,

35:58.699 --> 36:00.334
the Dragon's reservation.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.303
The Dragons were supposed
to be on that list.

36:02.336 --> 36:04.939
And somehow Mike just forgot.

36:04.972 --> 36:07.074
How is that missed?
How is that overlooked?

36:07.108 --> 36:08.509
They just--someone just--
the Dragons just came in--

36:08.542 --> 36:09.977
Mike, that's not
what I'm saying.

36:10.011 --> 36:12.313
I'm not exactly sure
what transpired.

36:12.346 --> 36:13.714
It's beyond upsetting.

36:13.748 --> 36:15.750
There was no Dragons on there.

36:15.783 --> 36:17.351
My God, that table for me

36:17.385 --> 36:21.756
is the most important table.

36:21.789 --> 36:23.291
That's embarrassing.

36:23.324 --> 36:26.074
You're overlooking
extremely important things.

36:26.074 --> 36:27.695
You're overlooking
extremely important things.

36:27.728 --> 36:28.996
I was not told
about the Dragons.

36:29.030 --> 36:30.164
I found out at se--

36:30.197 --> 36:31.432
Mike, why do
you keep saying that?

36:31.465 --> 36:33.100
Because I wasn't!
I wasn't told!

36:35.069 --> 36:37.405
Excuse me,
do not talk to me like that.

36:37.438 --> 36:39.607
I was told at 7:00 this morning!

36:39.640 --> 36:41.108
That's it!

36:41.142 --> 36:42.310
Seriously, I'm pissed off!

36:42.343 --> 36:45.079
Dragons on the paper!

36:45.112 --> 36:46.580
I'm pissed off!

36:46.614 --> 36:49.583
Not my fault!

36:49.617 --> 36:52.320
Dragons right over here!
I put 'em on at 7:00!

36:52.353 --> 36:53.688
Can we please move on?

36:53.721 --> 36:54.755
That's it!

36:54.789 --> 36:56.074
Not my fault!

36:56.074 --> 36:56.791
Not my fault!

37:04.154 --> 37:06.890
It's re-launch night
for The Mixing Bowl.

37:06.923 --> 37:09.959
And Mike's reservation mishap
with the New York Dragons

37:09.993 --> 37:11.995
has caused him
to go over the edge.

37:12.028 --> 37:13.096
I wasn't told!

37:13.129 --> 37:15.198
Do not talk to me like that.

37:15.231 --> 37:16.199
I'm pissed off!

37:16.232 --> 37:17.767
That's it!

37:17.801 --> 37:19.035
I was told
at 7:00 this morning!

37:19.069 --> 37:19.936
Not my fault!

37:19.969 --> 37:22.839
Dragons on the paper!

37:22.872 --> 37:24.808
I mean--
Can we please move on?!

37:24.841 --> 37:28.712
That's it!

37:28.745 --> 37:29.050
We were all
in shock and speechless.

37:29.050 --> 37:32.682
We were all
in shock and speechless.

37:32.716 --> 37:33.883
I've seen him blow up before,

37:33.917 --> 37:35.185
but that was a new--

37:35.218 --> 37:36.686
that was
a new level right there.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.987
Hey.
Yes.

37:38.021 --> 37:40.924
You  off outside now.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.796
This is like The Twilight Zone.

37:46.830 --> 37:47.997
I really think something

37:48.031 --> 37:50.633
in his brain has snapped.

37:50.667 --> 37:55.772
He's a freakin' lunatic.

37:55.805 --> 37:58.608
Mike was raising his voice.

37:58.641 --> 37:59.050
I mean, I don't want him to talk
to my wife that way.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.543
I mean, I don't want him to talk
to my wife that way.

38:00.577 --> 38:02.212
I don't go for that.

38:02.245 --> 38:05.548
Mike's conduct
has everyone rattled.

38:05.582 --> 38:09.452
And Gordon has some concerns
for the restaurant owners.

38:09.486 --> 38:12.789
Okay.

38:12.822 --> 38:14.491
Let me just
tell you something.

38:14.524 --> 38:16.259
And I've got
to be brutally honest.

38:16.292 --> 38:20.897
You've got one problem here.

38:20.930 --> 38:23.266
Mike.

38:23.299 --> 38:25.802
I don't know why Billy and Lisa
were talking to Gordon.

38:25.835 --> 38:28.304
I don't know what they possibly
could have said about me.

38:28.338 --> 38:29.050
You need
a manager,

38:29.050 --> 38:31.474
You need
a manager,

38:31.508 --> 38:33.676
and that is not your man.

38:33.710 --> 38:35.678
Business is business.

38:35.712 --> 38:37.447
If something's gotta be done
to change

38:37.480 --> 38:39.482
this place,
we gotta change it.

38:39.516 --> 38:41.084
That's the restaurant business.

38:41.117 --> 38:44.187
Freakin' fire him.

38:44.220 --> 38:46.623
If I would go home right now,

38:46.656 --> 38:48.558
life goes on.

38:48.591 --> 38:50.226
I'd get another job.

38:50.260 --> 38:54.931
But my life would be different.

38:54.964 --> 38:59.050
Um, I just gotta re-evaluate
the situation.

38:59.050 --> 38:59.369
Um, I just gotta re-evaluate
the situation.

38:59.402 --> 39:03.773
Mike's gonna have to change
like the place has changed.

39:03.807 --> 39:05.875
Everybody else in the place
is gonna get a second chance,

39:05.909 --> 39:07.944
so Mike should get
a second chance.

39:07.977 --> 39:10.280
We're gonna move forward
together.

39:10.313 --> 39:13.883
For now Billy has decided
to keep Mike on as manager.

39:13.917 --> 39:15.985
Move on.

39:16.019 --> 39:17.020
Yeah.

39:17.053 --> 39:18.988
That was embarrassing.
Yeah?

39:19.022 --> 39:21.090
Can we put an end to this?

39:21.124 --> 39:24.794
I feel like I'm reborn again.

39:24.828 --> 39:27.964
And we're gonna build
the best damn restaurant

39:27.997 --> 39:29.050
that--that ever existed...

39:29.050 --> 39:31.601
that--that ever existed...

39:31.634 --> 39:34.370
or at least
in a 25-mile radius.

39:34.404 --> 39:36.306
All right,
table two's getting up.

39:36.339 --> 39:38.308
We're gonna push 'em together
for a table of four.

39:38.341 --> 39:40.810
Mike managed to find a place
to seat the Dragons.

39:40.844 --> 39:44.380
And it looks like Gordon has
finally gotten through to him.

39:44.414 --> 39:46.216
Ready...

39:46.249 --> 39:48.418
set, hike--no.

39:49.919 --> 39:51.921
I have a new--a new look,
new restaurant, new me.

39:51.955 --> 39:54.123
Thank you so much for coming.
I appreciate it.

39:54.157 --> 39:55.825
Gonna get your dinner out
real quick.

39:55.859 --> 39:58.194
Good job.
Good job.

39:58.228 --> 39:59.050
For the first time
he said thank you to me.

39:59.050 --> 40:00.730
For the first time
he said thank you to me.

40:00.763 --> 40:02.565
So that was, like, wow.

40:02.599 --> 40:05.501
All of a sudden...
Mike...

40:05.535 --> 40:06.603
You know, like, "Was that him?"

40:06.636 --> 40:08.071
He was great.

40:08.104 --> 40:10.106
The service has been excellent.
I give the service a A.

40:10.139 --> 40:11.708
Definitely.

40:11.741 --> 40:13.409
Although The Mixing Bowl's
re-launch

40:13.443 --> 40:15.178
had some growing pains,

40:15.211 --> 40:19.249
it's clear the restaurant is
headed in the right direction.

40:19.282 --> 40:20.850
Whoo!

40:20.884 --> 40:22.552
Cheers, doll.

40:28.324 --> 40:29.050
As the week progressed,

40:29.050 --> 40:31.160
As the week progressed,

40:31.194 --> 40:33.730
Mike's management skills
kept improving.

40:33.763 --> 40:35.665
One and two is crucial
that we get out of here.

40:35.698 --> 40:37.433
It's really good.

40:37.467 --> 40:40.136
The customers raved
about the vibrant food.

40:43.706 --> 40:46.276
We got some amazing feedback
from the food, Billy.

40:46.309 --> 40:49.045
Everybody's
really loving the food.

40:49.078 --> 40:50.847
Holy moly.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.715
The profits were soaring.

40:52.749 --> 40:55.318
What each person spends
on average went up,

40:55.351 --> 40:57.053
like--like, double.

40:57.086 --> 40:59.050
In the spirit
of the new healthy menu,

40:59.050 --> 40:59.956
In the spirit
of the new healthy menu,

40:59.989 --> 41:03.126
Gordon sponsored the first-ever
Mixing Bowl Mile run.

41:03.159 --> 41:04.928
Come on, Mike!

41:04.961 --> 41:07.864
Come on, Mike.
An eight-year-old is beatin' ya!

41:07.897 --> 41:09.899
And with the restaurant
thriving,

41:09.933 --> 41:11.801
Billy even found some time
to hang out

41:11.834 --> 41:14.137
with his new friends,
the Dragons.

41:14.170 --> 41:15.872
This journey was unbelievable.

41:15.905 --> 41:17.740
I'm psyched to go forward.

41:17.774 --> 41:19.909
That's what I wanna see,
that passion, yes?

41:19.943 --> 41:21.544
Yeah.

41:21.577 --> 41:24.948
And on Gordon's last day
he even got shy Billy

41:24.981 --> 41:26.616
to finally come out
of the kitchen.

41:26.649 --> 41:28.017
I want you to stop
what you're doing

41:28.051 --> 41:29.050
for two minutes and go
and say hello to your customers.

41:29.050 --> 41:29.152
for two minutes and go
and say hello to your customers.

41:32.755 --> 41:34.691
I'm so proud of him.

41:34.724 --> 41:36.225
I couldn't be more proud of him.

41:36.259 --> 41:38.561
I want him to get
a little recognition

41:38.594 --> 41:42.765
for all that he does.

41:42.799 --> 41:43.800
Thank you so much.

41:43.833 --> 41:48.271
Yeah, thank you.

41:48.304 --> 41:49.806
The difference tonight
from when I first arrived

41:49.839 --> 41:51.107
was extraordinary.

41:51.140 --> 41:52.408
I would seriously eat here.

41:52.442 --> 41:54.344
You're talented, big boy.

41:54.377 --> 41:57.680
You've got
to make that transition

41:57.714 --> 41:59.050
from a chef
to a restaurateur.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.016
from a chef
to a restaurateur.

42:00.049 --> 42:01.951
I got the message
on how I have

42:01.985 --> 42:03.920
to change to make this place
the best it could be.

42:03.953 --> 42:06.689
Start thinkin'
and cookin' up there,

42:06.723 --> 42:08.424
not with your back.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.459
Yes.
Lovely.

42:09.492 --> 42:11.260
Thank you so much.

42:11.294 --> 42:13.763
The black cloud has definitely
been lifted off this restaurant.

42:13.796 --> 42:15.498
We can't blame anyone
but ourselves now

42:15.531 --> 42:16.566
because there's
no excuses left.

42:18.434 --> 42:19.669
Ladies--
Oh, me.

42:21.371 --> 42:22.805
Thank you..

42:22.839 --> 42:24.273
Oh, no.

42:24.307 --> 42:25.842
It all came together.

42:25.875 --> 42:27.610
And I just can't wait
to go forward.

42:27.643 --> 42:28.778
Good night.

42:28.811 --> 42:29.050
Thank you.

42:29.050 --> 42:30.446
Thank you.

42:36.352 --> 42:39.122
Two months have gone by,

42:39.155 --> 42:42.058
and the restaurant
is continuing to prosper.

42:42.091 --> 42:44.227
Gordon, he just let everything
out on me.

42:44.260 --> 42:46.062
It was, like,
rip on Mike week.

42:46.095 --> 42:47.830
But he definitely
did teach me some things.

42:47.864 --> 42:49.532
We had fun with it.

42:49.565 --> 42:51.601
As for Billy and Lisa,

42:51.634 --> 42:55.671
their marriage is as strong
as the restaurant itself.

42:55.705 --> 42:59.050
The changes I've seen
in our relationship is amazing.

42:59.050 --> 42:59.308
The changes I've seen
in our relationship is amazing.

42:59.342 --> 43:02.278
So for that,
Gordon, I thank you.

43:02.311 --> 43:05.815
That means so much to me.
