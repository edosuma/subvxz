WEBVTT

00:02.373 --> 00:06.048
Wow. I guess there is
life on this campus after all.

00:06.133 --> 00:09.409
- You've been here before?
- I guest-lectured last year.

00:09.493 --> 00:13.406
Forensic Science majors.
Four students showed up. Just four.

00:13.493 --> 00:15.051
Four? What was your topic?

00:15.133 --> 00:17.647
Dimorphic distinctions
in the thoracic cavity.

00:17.733 --> 00:21.851
Right. And, uh, just four
whole people showed up, huh?

00:21.933 --> 00:24.891
The dean blamed it on some game
halfway across the country.

00:24.973 --> 00:27.726
Atlantic State University
is the home of the Jaguars.

00:27.813 --> 00:31.567
Other than sex and beer,
nothing is more important than basketball.

00:31.653 --> 00:35.851
- What about academics?
- You bring your little didactic speech here

00:35.933 --> 00:38.970
any other time of the year
and you'll draw five, easy.

00:39.053 --> 00:41.044
Dimorphic, not didactic.

00:41.733 --> 00:45.442
A student employee,
Justine Berry, opened up the practice gym.

00:45.533 --> 00:48.093
Police didn't know
what to make of what they found.

00:48.173 --> 00:52.371
Yeah, I got it. FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
That here is... that's Dr Brennan.

00:52.453 --> 00:56.571
Chief Jack Cutler, campus police. Justine
opened the gym after the long weekend.

00:56.653 --> 00:59.451
- Work here, Ms Berry?
- What the hell? Know what I mean?

00:59.533 --> 01:00.932
Not at all.

01:01.013 --> 01:06.610
The second I unlocked the door,
the smell just... Right?

01:06.693 --> 01:09.605
The bleachers fold down.
You need a key to open or shut 'em.

01:09.693 --> 01:12.571
Whatever got caught back here,
it sure ain't an animal.

01:12.653 --> 01:14.530
Whoa. "It"?

01:14.613 --> 01:16.922
Sounds interesting.

01:17.413 --> 01:18.766
Oh.

01:18.853 --> 01:23.085
Hey. Last time I was under the bleachers,
I was getting ready to smoke a cigarette

01:23.173 --> 01:24.970
and make out with Vanessa Taylor.

01:25.053 --> 01:27.169
- I didn't know you smoked.
- Eighth grade.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.609
Didn't you ever get naughty with a jock
under the bleachers?

01:30.693 --> 01:35.130
- You were a jock?
- You had to be to make out with Vanessa.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.933 --> 01:48.084
- What is it?
- Male.

01:48.173 --> 01:50.129
- You smell that?
- You're kidding.

01:50.213 --> 01:52.363
I don't mean decomp.
Alcohol.

01:52.453 --> 01:55.445
Vagrant passes out by the heating grate,
someone closes up.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.252
Whoa.

01:58.973 --> 02:02.124
That would account for the decomp.

02:03.653 --> 02:04.972
And the babies.

02:05.053 --> 02:07.248
- Baby rats?
- Yeah. We'll need them.

02:07.333 --> 02:12.532
- OK. Chief Cutler, you got a rat carrier?
- Yeah, I'll find something.

02:12.613 --> 02:15.002
- We'll need the floor.
- The floor?

02:15.093 --> 02:18.005
- Whatever got pushed through the grate.
- Here. This do?

02:18.093 --> 02:20.891
Great. Just put that rat there in the rat motel.

02:20.973 --> 02:25.125
- We need to take the pinkies or they'll die.
- Yeah. Cos the world needs more rats.

02:25.213 --> 02:29.126
'82 champs. '82 champs?
Let me see that ring.

02:29.213 --> 02:34.571
Wait a minute.
Chief Cutler as in Jack "Cutter" Cutler?

02:34.653 --> 02:37.008
Yeah. Haven't heard that one in a while.

02:37.093 --> 02:39.607
Bones, you're looking at
the star point guard

02:39.693 --> 02:42.844
from one of the best
college basketball teams ever!

02:42.933 --> 02:45.322
- Oh.
- Drafted by the Detroit Pistons.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.881
Knees blew out.
Ended my career.

02:47.973 --> 02:49.725
- Booth?
- Yeah?

02:50.333 --> 02:52.563
"11"?

02:52.653 --> 02:54.166
Oh, my God. No.

02:54.253 --> 02:56.528
- What?
- Did he wear one of these?

02:56.613 --> 02:58.205
- He never took it off.
- Who?

02:58.293 --> 03:01.330
RJ Manning.
He's one of the best college forwards.

03:01.413 --> 03:03.449
He was destined
to be number-one pick.

03:03.533 --> 03:08.482
I don't know what that means but, if this
is Manning, that's not going to happen.

03:45.813 --> 03:49.931
- Eight seconds to close the bleachers?
- According to the chief of campus police.

03:50.013 --> 03:52.402
I don't think
he was killed by the bleachers.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.484
What do you mean?
He's an accordion.

03:54.573 --> 03:58.088
- So what killed him?
- The skull shows evidence of powdering.

03:58.173 --> 04:02.007
Crushing would snap the bone.
Multiple strikes lead to powdering.

04:02.093 --> 04:07.565
Maybe being forced through a grate caused it.
We'll know after the skull's reconstructed.

04:07.653 --> 04:11.009
Man, the Jaguars will not be the same
without RJ Manning.

04:11.093 --> 04:14.244
30 plus points in his last five games,
40 plus in the last three.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.962
-  Not you guys too?
- He was gonna be the next Kobe Bryant.

04:18.053 --> 04:21.601
That explains why every news source
in town wants to confirm his death.

04:21.692 --> 04:25.481
The Ancient Greeks chased a ball made of
animal skin wrapped around seeds.

04:25.573 --> 04:28.007
But that was a fertility rite
played in the nude.

04:28.093 --> 04:31.529
- Nude? Count me in.
- I tend to look better fully clothed.

04:31.613 --> 04:35.242
Both central and lateral
maxillary incisors are implants.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.642
That's a match.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.052
- It's Manning.
- I'll inform the press.

04:42.533 --> 04:46.526
Zack, your priority
is to classify the skull fractures.

04:46.613 --> 04:49.127
Dude, you're not going home for days.

04:49.213 --> 04:53.570
The victim's clothing and the chunk of floor
should keep you pretty busy too.

04:56.253 --> 04:59.848
You're sure it's RJ? Not just somebody
wearing his medallion?

04:59.933 --> 05:04.290
- We matched your brother's dental records.
- That means it's definitely RJ, Kamaria.

05:04.373 --> 05:07.649
- Are you RJ's lawyer?
- No. Well, you could probably say that.

05:07.733 --> 05:10.452
I'm... I'm an alumnus of Atlantic State.

05:10.533 --> 05:15.448
I volunteer my time to help the team with
finances, scholarships, living arrangements.

05:15.533 --> 05:17.364
Did you all live together?

05:17.453 --> 05:21.446
No. RJ lived on campus. But he still
takes care of me and my little sister.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.091
Their parents passed away.

05:23.173 --> 05:26.688
We lived on RJ's scholarship and
Mr Francis got me a good job downtown.

05:26.773 --> 05:31.369
Yeah. RJ mention any trouble in his life
lately? Arguments?

05:31.453 --> 05:34.490
- Only...
- It's OK, it's OK.

05:34.573 --> 05:36.564
He had a fight with Mr Francis.

05:36.653 --> 05:37.847
Why did RJ strike you?

05:37.933 --> 05:42.131
I don't know. He was an exhausted 20-year-old
man and I was treating him like a kid.

05:42.213 --> 05:47.241
RJ loved Mr Francis. We all do.
You can ask RJ's girlfriend.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.563
That's Dallas Verona.
She's a cheerleader.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.883
Also, you should talk to Coach Morse.

05:51.973 --> 05:56.524
Those were the two people closest to him,
other than his family.

05:56.613 --> 06:02.085
Dammit. I should've gotten a bigger turkey.
Do you have a smaller skull?

06:04.091 --> 06:06.082
- Do I have a smaller skull than whom?
- I meant, is there a smaller skull

06:08.090 --> 06:10.285
- we can wrap in this turkey carcass?
- Boys, this better be good.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.965
It'll take me a very long time
to reconstruct RJ Manning's skull

06:14.050 --> 06:16.928
to discover
whether he died from multiple blows...

06:17.010 --> 06:18.238
Which suggests murder.

06:18.330 --> 06:22.369
...or if his skull was crushed through
the heating grate just like this one.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.918
We covered a skull
with turkey meat.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.241
I calibrated the pounds per square inch
from the closing bleachers.

06:28.330 --> 06:31.402
We filled the skull cavity
with a gelatinous matrix.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.921
OK. Turn it on.

06:49.450 --> 06:53.409
By "gelatinous matrix"
you meant ambrosia salad?

06:53.490 --> 06:56.846
"Gelatinous matrix" sounded better.

06:59.170 --> 07:01.240
There's no sign of powdering here.

07:01.330 --> 07:04.845
Then RJ Manning was killed
by multiple strikes to the head.

07:13.010 --> 07:15.444
George Francis
does not care about that family.

07:15.530 --> 07:18.886
- Kamaria liked him.
- He paid the rent, made her brother a star.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.928
- But he's got a whole other agenda.
- How do you know?

07:22.010 --> 07:25.320
I was a college athlete.
Guys like that always buzz around campus.

07:25.410 --> 07:28.925
- Why?
- Because there's millions of dollars at stake.

07:29.010 --> 07:30.841
- For bouncing a ball?
- Well, yeah.

07:30.930 --> 07:33.319
All that bouncing
translates into dollars

07:33.410 --> 07:36.959
from TV rights,
revenue shares, tournament fees.

07:37.050 --> 07:40.122
Well, I don't understand
what's interesting about it.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.806
You know, unlike you, most people enjoy
a pastime that takes them out of their head.

07:44.890 --> 07:48.769
Takes them out of their head?
Like drugs and alcohol?

07:50.770 --> 07:52.761
Brennan.

07:54.570 --> 07:57.801
- Hodgins and Zack proved RJ was murdered.
- Murdered?

07:57.890 --> 08:01.963
We've suffered a loss, gentlemen.
One of our brothers is gone.

08:02.050 --> 08:04.280
As a team, we grieve for him.

08:04.370 --> 08:07.248
I tell you what
you do not weep for, though.

08:07.330 --> 08:10.322
Losing the best damn power forward
in this entire country.

08:10.410 --> 08:13.925
Colby Page is not shedding tears
cos we lost a power forward, is he?

08:14.010 --> 08:15.841
- No, sir!
- How do I know that?

08:15.930 --> 08:18.683
Because Colby Page
is gonna take RJ's position.

08:18.770 --> 08:21.364
This is his opportunity,
and it's good that he sees it as such.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.361
Colby?

08:27.727 --> 08:31.766
Accept our brother, RJ Manning,
into your loving arms.

08:31.847 --> 08:34.566
Give us the faith
and the strength to carry on.

08:36.207 --> 08:37.958
- Amen.
-  Amen.

08:38.047 --> 08:40.607
Now you boys go be together.
Talk about RJ.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.759
Come right back here
and be ready to do what needs doing.

08:43.847 --> 08:47.283
-  Yes, Coach.
- All right, let's go!

08:47.367 --> 08:49.517
Let's do this!
Let's go! Move it, Harris!

08:49.607 --> 08:50.881
Yes, sir!

08:51.927 --> 08:53.076
Very impressive.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.805
- You the FBI?
- Yes, sir.

08:54.887 --> 08:57.845
If you're gonna talk to the boys,
I'd prefer you do it soon.

08:57.927 --> 09:00.566
Let us move on from the tragedy, OK?

09:06.967 --> 09:08.525
What now?

09:08.607 --> 09:14.125
Well, find out which one of these pretty girls
over here is RJ's girlfriend.

09:18.367 --> 09:22.406
I went home for the long weekend.
RJ stayed on campus.

09:22.487 --> 09:25.638
- Why?
- Whatever. Team stuff.

09:25.727 --> 09:28.036
Did you call RJ?
Talk to him?

09:28.127 --> 09:32.120
Yeah. And texted him.
But he didn't answer.

09:32.207 --> 09:36.120
That's not weird or anything.
RJ's the face-to-face kind, right?

09:36.767 --> 09:38.997
Everything OK between you?

09:39.087 --> 09:42.284
- Were you sexually active?
- He was my boyfriend.

09:42.367 --> 09:45.359
He was in great shape,
so pretty active, yeah.

09:45.447 --> 09:51.283
Were there any noticeable changes
in your sex life? Frequency? Duration?

09:51.367 --> 09:55.280
"Every day but game day."
That was RJ's motto.

09:55.367 --> 09:58.837
No jealous boyfriend from the past?
Angry dad? Nothing?

09:59.607 --> 10:03.964
Oh, my God.
Mr Francis is right.

10:04.047 --> 10:05.958
You people think RJ was murdered.

10:06.607 --> 10:11.317
- Was he under any kind of stress?
- Of course.

10:11.407 --> 10:14.365
Mid-term exams?

10:14.447 --> 10:19.157
RJ was a star. They made sure
he could pass his mid-terms.

10:19.247 --> 10:21.920
RJ was stressed
because he always wanted to win.

10:22.007 --> 10:24.077
Stressed enough to hit Mr Francis?

10:24.647 --> 10:28.526
RJ never told me why he did that.
But he felt bad about it.

10:35.087 --> 10:40.207
You didn't find enough tissue for a tox screen
cos these little scamps ate what was left.

10:40.287 --> 10:42.278
Yeah. Uh...

10:43.967 --> 10:48.324
Hodgins, is that my own
personal blender from the kitchen?

10:48.407 --> 10:51.205
I'll toss these babies
into the gas chromatograph.

10:53.247 --> 10:55.283
- Did you get it from the kitchen?
- Yes.

10:55.807 --> 10:59.766
Any foreign substances in RJ's body
should show up in the maggot juice.

10:59.847 --> 11:03.601
Is it labelled "Personal property of CS"
on the bottom?

11:07.207 --> 11:09.482
Yes.

11:11.527 --> 11:14.724
Don't worry. I'll rinse it out.

11:17.447 --> 11:21.804
I can give you a few pointers. Colby
doesn't get out of class for a few minutes.

11:21.887 --> 11:25.163
You gotta sort of flip your wrist.
See? Bang.

11:25.247 --> 11:27.761
Sports should not have such a priority.

11:27.847 --> 11:30.202
All right, you know what?
That's crazy.

11:30.287 --> 11:36.635
No. Anthropologically speaking, sports are
a way for boys to practise their battle skills.

11:36.727 --> 11:41.755
Yeah, OK. So you want to just focus straight
up, get up on your toes, and just slip...

11:41.847 --> 11:45.840
The truth is, athletes are basically
emotionally arrested in boyhood,

11:45.927 --> 11:49.636
acting out childish games
as though they have adult importance.

11:49.727 --> 11:54.039
You know, the only thing more juvenile
are grown adults who watch sports.

11:54.127 --> 11:56.436
- Why do you say stuff like that?
- The truth?

11:56.527 --> 11:58.597
All right.
You know what? I'm a jock.

11:58.687 --> 12:02.441
So when you say those things that you say,
what are you saying about me?

12:02.527 --> 12:06.884
- Nothing. You grew out of it.
- No, I didn't. My shoulder crapped out on me.

12:06.967 --> 12:09.959
Otherwise, I would have
gone all the way with it.

12:10.047 --> 12:10.957
What?!

12:11.047 --> 12:15.120
And another thing, all right?
I fought in a war!

12:15.207 --> 12:18.643
So if sports is
a childish substitute...

12:19.647 --> 12:21.524
I can live with that!

12:45.687 --> 12:47.757
- Yo, Colby!
- "Yo"?

12:47.847 --> 12:49.963
Yeah, yo.
I'm a little irritated with you.

12:50.047 --> 12:52.356
Leave me alone long enough
so I can get over it.

12:52.447 --> 12:54.563
- Why are you irritated?
- I love sports.

12:54.647 --> 12:57.605
I watch sports, you know?
I'm all about sports, you know?

12:57.687 --> 12:59.803
Agent Seeley Booth.
This is Dr Brennan.

12:59.887 --> 13:01.718
Mr Francis said you wanted to talk.

13:01.807 --> 13:05.163
George Francis?
He really looks out for you guys, huh?

13:05.247 --> 13:08.876
- You must be happy to be a stringer again?
- Starter, Bones.

13:08.967 --> 13:12.277
I'm happy to be starting
but not happy about how it happened.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.722
- Colby didn't ask for this.
- It's OK, Celeste.

13:14.807 --> 13:16.957
Colby's a team player.
He's stepping up.

13:17.047 --> 13:21.359
- This is my fiancée, Celeste Cutler.
- They're engaged? They're awfully young.

13:21.447 --> 13:25.998
- Cutler? As in..."Cutter" Cutler?
- Yeah. He's my father.

13:26.087 --> 13:29.124
Your dad's in law enforcement.
You understand I have to ask questions.

13:31.125 --> 13:33.116
Your boyfriend is one of the few people
who benefited from RJ Manning's death.

13:35.124 --> 13:37.843
I don't like you.
I hate her.

13:37.924 --> 13:40.836
I can handle this.
Just go on, Celeste, OK?

13:41.524 --> 13:42.752
All right.

13:43.924 --> 13:48.873
I'm sorry about Celeste.
She's just really, really loyal.

13:48.964 --> 13:53.003
I have to ask you,
where were you over the long weekend?

13:53.084 --> 13:55.962
I was home.
Look, I hate to disagree with Coach,

13:56.044 --> 13:58.353
but I didn't really
benefit from RJ's death.

13:58.444 --> 14:01.754
- It sure seems like you did.
- Starting power forward, that's big.

14:01.844 --> 14:06.235
I'm not gonna replace RJ
just because I take over his position.

14:06.324 --> 14:09.122
Every game people are gonna say,
"Good game, son."

14:09.204 --> 14:12.833
But in their head they're thinking,
"He's no RJ Manning."

14:12.924 --> 14:15.961
Does that sound like something
that I would kill to achieve?

14:16.044 --> 14:18.922
Look, I was happy where I was.

14:19.004 --> 14:21.962
I'm a team player, not a star.

14:22.684 --> 14:26.677
Look, you said you were at home.
Can anyone verify that? Your parents?

14:26.764 --> 14:32.236
I'm not gonna answer any more questions
until I talk to Mr Francis.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.395
I'm sorry.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.393
Hm. Francis again.

14:47.884 --> 14:50.717
- Hodgins here?
- No.

14:50.804 --> 14:53.193
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

14:56.764 --> 15:00.074
Can I leave a message for him with you?

15:00.764 --> 15:02.436
- Why me?
- Are you serious?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.638
Fine.

15:04.724 --> 15:10.321
- I mean, you live together, right?
- No. I mean, not officially.

15:10.404 --> 15:12.360
We have our own places.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.675
- But you spend all your time together.
- What's the message?

15:15.764 --> 15:19.234
Tox results for RJ Manning.
Negative for alcohol and sedatives.

15:19.324 --> 15:21.997
- But he reeked of bourbon.
- Someone poured it on him.

15:22.084 --> 15:23.995
Interestingly, he was on steroids.

15:24.084 --> 15:27.997
I haven't found an explanation
for the extra synovial fluid in the joints.

15:28.084 --> 15:30.962
I'm not sure
I can remember all this.

15:31.044 --> 15:33.638
Steroids, bourbon, synovial fluid.
Any problems?

15:33.724 --> 15:37.842
I draw stuff, OK?
Fluids are not my actual area of expertise.

15:37.924 --> 15:42.998
It's Hodgins' actual area of expertise
and Hodgins is your area of expertise.

15:43.084 --> 15:47.475
So, by my calculations, all the areas
of expertise are overlapping perfectly.

15:47.564 --> 15:50.920
It's not a problem.
I'll give it to him.

15:51.004 --> 15:53.199
Thank you.

15:57.644 --> 16:02.320
I read your contract. You get a million-dollar
conduct bonus for keeping your kids in line.

16:02.404 --> 16:07.876
I oversee 30 healthy, rambunctious,
Type A boys. I earn every penny of it.

16:07.964 --> 16:12.242
Guess you'd kiss that million dollars goodbye
if RJ tested positive for steroids.

16:14.524 --> 16:16.515
- No way.
- Tox screen came back positive.

16:18.523 --> 16:21.560
- It doesn't make sense.
- Better he plays, he's worth more to the pros,

16:21.643 --> 16:24.555
better chance you have
to move up to the NBA.

16:27.763 --> 16:30.721
You see this?
You see this scar?

16:31.763 --> 16:34.880
Brain cancer from steroids.

16:34.963 --> 16:38.319
When it comes to my team,
I have zero tolerance, and they know it.

16:38.403 --> 16:41.201
- What do you do if you catch 'em?
- I don't kill 'em.

16:41.283 --> 16:44.719
Million-dollar bonus,
free ride to the NBA.

16:44.803 --> 16:48.512
Listen, I'll tell you what.
You call my doctor.

16:48.603 --> 16:52.642
I'm terminal.
I got two years, tops.

16:52.723 --> 16:56.557
The money, the career -
not big incentives.

17:00.403 --> 17:04.316
I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention it
to anyone. I don't want sympathy.

17:04.403 --> 17:06.598
I just want my boys
to win this season.

17:06.683 --> 17:08.799
I gotta pursue the steroid thing.

17:08.883 --> 17:13.832
You don't need a warrant. Any boy that does
not submit a urine sample is off this team.

17:16.563 --> 17:19.873
- Not one sample shows steroid use?
- Not one.

17:19.963 --> 17:23.751
The coach's confidence was justified,
at least as far as steroids.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.403
- Something else showed up?
- Two samples were positive for cefixime.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.391
- The antibiotic?
- Most commonly used to treat gonorrhoea.

17:32.399 --> 17:35.755
Gonorrhoea would explain the excess
synovial fluid in RJ's joints.

17:35.839 --> 17:39.912
So RJ plus two members of the team
had gonorrhoea?

17:39.999 --> 17:44.550
Nope. Two of the urine samples came back
with not only identical levels of antibiotic,

17:44.639 --> 17:47.870
but... the exact same
specific gravity.

17:48.759 --> 17:51.478
- Two samples from the same player?
- Yes.

17:51.559 --> 17:56.269
My guess is that someone with gonorrhoea
is trying to protect someone using steroids.

17:57.719 --> 17:59.914
Nice bunch of boys.

17:59.999 --> 18:05.995
One of you is taking steroids, and the other
one is being treated for the clap.

18:06.079 --> 18:09.674
- Somebody is taking steroids?
- Thanks for your candour, Jimmy.

18:09.759 --> 18:11.238
I didn't admit anything.

18:11.319 --> 18:13.753
The guy on steroids
would worry about steroids.

18:13.839 --> 18:16.148
The guy with the clap, Eddie,
wouldn't worry.

18:16.239 --> 18:19.595
Well, why worry?
It's just a shot in the ass.

18:19.679 --> 18:21.590
He was guessing
till you admitted it.

18:21.679 --> 18:24.318
- Thank you, Ed. You can leave now.
- Why can he leave?

18:24.399 --> 18:27.471
I don't care where he's been
dipping his, you know... wick.

18:27.559 --> 18:31.347
I care about illegal steroids.
Get lost, Ed. Leave.

18:37.437 --> 18:40.076
Maybe RJ's just worried
about the side effects.

18:40.157 --> 18:42.830
You know,
all the yelling and screaming,

18:42.917 --> 18:45.750
all the zits on his pretty face,
his manhood shrinking.

18:47.755 --> 18:49.746
- Maybe he gets nervous, wants to confess.
- So I kill him?

18:51.754 --> 18:56.032
That's crazy! RJ made me look good enough
to go to Europe leagues, even the NBA!

18:56.114 --> 19:01.586
- You can't even prove I'm on steroids.
- I have a warrant to check you for steroids.

19:01.674 --> 19:06.828
It's a paper trail, and it becomes
public knowledge, my friend.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.106
- Man, I'll lose my eligibility.
- Bingo.

19:11.194 --> 19:14.948
You tell me who provided you with steroids
and it stays between you and me.

19:15.034 --> 19:18.026
Or, uh...

19:18.114 --> 19:20.582
you gotta pee in the cup.

19:20.674 --> 19:25.509
- Come on, man.
- This time I'm gonna have to watch you pee.

19:25.594 --> 19:29.109
I hope you don't have
a bashful bladder.

19:30.874 --> 19:34.389
- Dr Saroyan?
- Yes, Angela?

19:34.474 --> 19:36.544
I've been thinking about it and...

19:37.154 --> 19:40.510
I don't think it was professional of you
to leave this file with me.

19:40.594 --> 19:44.030
- Really? Why is that?
- I'm not Hodgins's assistant.

19:44.114 --> 19:45.467
You are his girlfriend.

19:45.554 --> 19:50.344
The problem is that being his girlfriend
is a personal, private thing, and this is work.

19:50.434 --> 19:53.631
- Ah.
- It's not good to mix the personal and work.

19:53.714 --> 19:58.071
Hodgins and I are separate human beings
with completely separate careers.

19:58.154 --> 20:02.909
- In your opinion, I crossed a line?
- Yeah. It's my opinion.

20:03.914 --> 20:06.826
- I apologise, Angela.
- Thank you.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.748
But you might be able to understand
why I was a little confused,

20:10.834 --> 20:15.703
because apparently you're not always
against bringing your personal life to work.

20:15.794 --> 20:18.991
Oh, my God.

20:19.074 --> 20:21.542
What you're doing there
is extremely personal.

20:21.634 --> 20:24.432
Yeah. Extremely personal.

20:24.514 --> 20:29.269
I'm seeing parts of you and Hodgins
I'd rather leave to the imagination.

20:29.354 --> 20:34.553
When did they put security cameras
in the storage area? Who else has seen this?

20:34.634 --> 20:37.785
So far, just me
and a very appreciative security guard.

20:37.874 --> 20:40.263
Oh, my God.
Well, you've made your point.

20:40.354 --> 20:42.549
Good.
This is the only copy.

20:43.954 --> 20:46.832
Do we get any points
for this occurring during lunch?

20:46.914 --> 20:49.508
Which is, as you know,
personal time.

20:49.594 --> 20:52.233
- No.
- Fair enough. I had to ask.

20:57.834 --> 21:01.224
Trust me. I know what I'm talking about.
You gotta know...

21:01.314 --> 21:06.513
George Francis, you're under arrest
for providing restricted substances.

21:06.594 --> 21:09.984
- You said you were just gonna talk.
- Then I saw his face and I got mad.

21:10.074 --> 21:14.431
You have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can and will be used against you.

21:14.514 --> 21:18.063
So this is a pretty good time
to tell us that you killed RJ Manning,

21:18.154 --> 21:19.872
save us all a hell of a lot of time.

21:19.954 --> 21:23.151
Why would I kill RJ?
Why would I kill the golden goose?

21:23.234 --> 21:25.794
He wasn't a goose.
He was a man.

21:25.874 --> 21:30.152
- Did he give you steroids too, Colby?
- No! He was trying to get me free housing!

21:30.234 --> 21:34.944
Colby, tell Cutler, OK?
Just tell him what's going on.

21:39.434 --> 21:42.392
- He was with Colby?
- Uh-huh.

21:43.474 --> 21:47.353
Colby's like a son to me. I mean,
he's about to become my son-in-law.

21:47.434 --> 21:50.392
You don't care
that Colby's not a star like RJ?

21:50.474 --> 21:52.226
As a man, sure,
I'd rather he be RJ,

21:52.314 --> 21:55.590
but as a father, Colby will make
a much better husband to my daughter.

21:57.594 --> 21:59.585
Was it worth it? You walk like a man
decades older than you are.

22:01.592 --> 22:02.388
You never played in the pros.

22:02.472 --> 22:05.748
Your wife left you because
you didn't turn out to be a star.

22:05.832 --> 22:10.064
I wasn't fun to be around when the cheering
stopped. You two don't pull any punches.

22:10.152 --> 22:13.462
I'll tell you what else I know.
You'd do it all over again, bud.

22:13.552 --> 22:16.703
That doesn't make any sense.

22:17.272 --> 22:23.142
Jocks. You understand each other,
but your priorities are completely skewed.

22:23.232 --> 22:26.622
Ignore Dr Brennan because
she's unreasonable on the subject.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.304
He won't admit to the steroids.

22:28.392 --> 22:29.950
- Plan B?
- Plan B.

22:30.032 --> 22:30.828
Plan B?

22:30.912 --> 22:35.622
Convince him if he doesn't admit the steroid
thing, then he's confessing to murder.

22:36.432 --> 22:38.992
We jocks will take care of this one.

22:44.752 --> 22:49.268
- I'm looking at a cockroach's leg?
- Technical term is "tarsus".

22:50.472 --> 22:51.825
Are they usually blue?

22:51.912 --> 22:57.145
No. He stepped in an amalgam of
fats, waxes, oil and calcium dye.

22:59.511 --> 23:01.502
- Lipstick.
- RJ Manning wore blue...

23:03.510 --> 23:05.023
lipstick?

23:05.110 --> 23:10.230
The lipstick wasn't found on his... lips.
You know what I mean?

23:10.310 --> 23:11.504
- Yes.
- Certain?

23:11.590 --> 23:13.421
Yes, Dr Hodgins.

23:29.630 --> 23:31.541
- Angela?
- Yeah?

23:33.350 --> 23:36.183
You know, this is pretty good.

23:36.270 --> 23:40.343
Usually with these things, you think,
"God. More yoga, less carbs." You know?

23:40.430 --> 23:43.183
But... this ain't bad.

23:43.910 --> 23:47.220
You might want to...
turn the volume down.

23:48.230 --> 23:50.619
Yeah. Thanks.

23:51.710 --> 23:55.498
You believe a kid taking steroids
over the best friend the college ever had?

23:55.590 --> 23:56.864
- Of course.
- Why?

23:56.950 --> 23:59.464
Because if you and RJ
argued about steroids,

23:59.550 --> 24:02.462
say he wanted more and you said no,
that would explain why he hit you.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.461
Yeah. You know, 'roid rage.

24:08.467 --> 24:10.298
- I never provided steroids to anybody.
- You know what I gotta do.

24:10.387 --> 24:12.617
Let me reason with him
one more time.

24:12.707 --> 24:17.064
Here's what's gonna happen, George.
If you don't admit to providing the steroids,

24:17.147 --> 24:21.663
Agent Booth is going to
arrest you for murder.

24:21.747 --> 24:22.975
That's ridiculous.

24:23.067 --> 24:25.422
- Really? Cos you got a great motive.
- What?

24:25.507 --> 24:30.422
RJ Manning admitted to you
he was gonna fess up that he was on 'roids.

24:30.507 --> 24:31.940
You panicked and killed him.

24:32.027 --> 24:35.258
- Now, who's gonna fall for this?
- Oh, the grand jury.

24:37.547 --> 24:40.778
RJ hitting me
had nothing to do with steroids.

24:40.867 --> 24:45.099
Agent Booth needs more than
your assurance on that, George.

24:48.027 --> 24:49.938
All right.

24:50.027 --> 24:52.860
RJ and I had a deal
and he wanted to break that deal.

24:52.947 --> 24:56.178
You signed him up, didn't you?
Illegal as hell.

24:56.267 --> 25:00.499
But George had RJ sign with him
for representation into the NBA, huh?

25:00.587 --> 25:05.945
NBA salary, merchandising rights,
signature shoe. And RJ wanted out, right?

25:06.027 --> 25:10.145
Cars, apartments, providing for his family.
I deserve a return on my investment.

25:10.227 --> 25:12.377
Was RJ the only one
you had a deal with?

25:12.467 --> 25:14.423
- Whoa, whoa!
- Who else? Colby? Huh?

25:14.507 --> 25:17.067
Colby's a nice kid
but he's never going pro.

25:17.147 --> 25:19.945
Now, I didn't kill RJ Manning.

25:20.027 --> 25:23.337
There's no point to it.
I had a legally binding contract with him.

25:23.427 --> 25:27.056
You rat bastard! If you don't arrest him
for that 'roid thing, I will, OK?

25:27.147 --> 25:30.219
I got him. I got him.
I will. I will. I got it.

25:38.907 --> 25:44.743
This is saliva I found in Manning's shorts.
I also found pre-seminal fluid.

25:44.827 --> 25:46.704
What does that mean?

25:46.787 --> 25:48.823
Are you serious?

25:48.907 --> 25:52.343
I know it means he had an erection,
but what does the erection mean?

25:52.427 --> 25:55.737
- That he was sexually stimulated.
- Well, I know that.

25:55.827 --> 26:00.821
Healthy post-adolescent males
experience 11 to 20 erections every day,

26:00.907 --> 26:03.660
any number of which
produce pre-seminal fluid.

26:03.747 --> 26:06.659
- But do those erections produce saliva?
- No.

26:06.747 --> 26:10.137
Cam's a doctor, honey.
That was an amusing rhetorical question.

26:11.027 --> 26:14.781
- Zack also found this in the victim's hair.
- What? Semen?

26:14.867 --> 26:18.337
No. Oesophageal mucous,
commonly known as a loogie.

26:18.427 --> 26:21.499
- Someone spat at the victim?
- Should I paint you a picture?

26:21.587 --> 26:23.339
No.

26:23.427 --> 26:27.579
Traces of pre-seminal fluid and saliva
inside the basketball shorts

26:27.667 --> 26:31.546
suggest oral sex during which
the victim did not ejaculate.

26:31.627 --> 26:34.187
Or perhaps he was killed
before ejaculation.

26:34.267 --> 26:37.464
I don't want to get graphic,
but wouldn't it be difficult

26:37.547 --> 26:41.062
to simultaneously bash someone's head in
while servicing them?

26:41.147 --> 26:42.865
Talk about multitasking.

26:42.947 --> 26:45.336
There might have been
a witness to this murder.

26:45.427 --> 26:49.659
According to a cockroach I know,
she might have been wearing blue lipstick.

26:52.827 --> 26:55.546
We have been assuming
the victim was conked on the head

26:55.627 --> 26:58.221
and dragged under the bleachers
and compressed.

26:58.307 --> 27:00.980
- I see.
- Two people involved: victim and murderer.

27:01.067 --> 27:05.026
- I see.
- Now we could have a three-person situation.

27:05.107 --> 27:10.181
- I see.
- Victim, murderer, victim's special friend.

27:10.907 --> 27:12.226
You need what from me?

27:12.307 --> 27:16.937
Any information you might have to lead us
to either the special friend or the murderer.

27:17.027 --> 27:21.145
You might be interested
in these crystalline deposits.

27:22.387 --> 27:26.062
- What is that?
- Bacteria, crystallised postmortem.

27:26.147 --> 27:28.661
Gonorrhoea bacteria?

27:28.747 --> 27:33.696
And we're back to RJ's special friend.
If only we could figure out who she is.

27:33.787 --> 27:35.903
You might want to ask Edward Dekker.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.137
This is from RJ Manning.

27:38.667 --> 27:42.865
And this is from Edward Dekker.
Same strain.

27:42.947 --> 27:45.222
The members of this team
are very close.

27:47.427 --> 27:50.544
-  Yeah! Babe alert! Whoo!
- You could wait outside, Bones.

27:50.627 --> 27:54.620
Are you still angry at me for saying
that athletes are emotionally stunted?

27:54.707 --> 27:57.744
No. Of course not.
Where is he?

27:57.827 --> 28:01.820
Hey, can I talk to you, Ed,
for a second?

28:03.707 --> 28:07.620
All I did was pee in a cup for Jimmy Fields.
All of sudden it's a federal case?

28:07.707 --> 28:10.699
- Turns out he has the clap.
- Exact same strain as you.

28:10.787 --> 28:14.257
Wait. You think I had sex with RJ?

28:15.587 --> 28:17.782
- I don't know. Did you?
- No!

28:17.867 --> 28:22.145
- Then why did you bring it up?
- <i>You</i> brought it up. I just peed in a cup.

28:22.227 --> 28:23.342
Why?

28:23.427 --> 28:27.659
Because Jimmy's a team-mate and he asked
me to. I would've done it for any of my bros.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.625
- How did this boy get into college?
- Basketball.

28:30.707 --> 28:34.256
I don't think I can be discussing
sexual topics with her looking at me.

28:34.347 --> 28:38.420
- Why?
- Because you're hot and I'm naked.

28:40.427 --> 28:44.306
- Maybe you should go stand over there.
- What? Because he's shy?

28:44.387 --> 28:47.857
Look. Maybe you didn't notice,
but I got no reason to be shy.

28:47.947 --> 28:53.943
Obviously he can't concentrate. So either
cover your eyes or stand over there, Bones.

28:56.827 --> 29:00.137
Yeah. I'll just... I'll be right here.

29:02.187 --> 29:05.338
Hey, man, she's smokin'.

29:05.987 --> 29:09.980
Now listen, Ed. I need to know
if you and RJ had sex with the same girl.

29:10.067 --> 29:12.501
Definitely.

29:12.587 --> 29:14.225
OK. Who?

29:14.307 --> 29:16.218
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

29:16.307 --> 29:20.664
Well, look. There are girls who like
to have sex with basketball players.

29:20.747 --> 29:24.103
- B-bunnies.
- B-bunnies, right. Yeah.

29:24.187 --> 29:27.862
Yeah. Look, I'm not saying me and RJ
ever crossed swords or anything,

29:27.947 --> 29:32.657
but, um... we were definitely
taking shots at the same hoops.

29:33.267 --> 29:37.180
- Right. Um... You wear condoms?
- Always. Yeah.

29:37.267 --> 29:39.622
You got the clap.

29:40.707 --> 29:44.302
- Right.
- So who didn't you wear a condom with?

29:44.387 --> 29:48.426
Attaboy. Now you're using your whole brain.

29:48.507 --> 29:50.065
Come on.

29:50.147 --> 29:52.945
All right, look.
I got a name in my head, OK?

29:53.027 --> 29:55.621
But there's no way
RJ Manning ever tapped that.

29:55.707 --> 29:58.301
The name, Ed. I need the name.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.141
My poli sci tutor - Justine.

30:02.227 --> 30:04.297
Hot not.

30:06.387 --> 30:12.303
All the bad decisions you made, and you're
ashamed of having sex with a not-hot girl?

30:12.387 --> 30:15.823
- What are you doing?
- What?

30:18.347 --> 30:22.465
I know I have gonorrhoea.
I'm being treated for it.

30:22.547 --> 30:24.856
Well, where'd you get it?

30:24.947 --> 30:29.020
They asked me that in Health Services.
Could've been a couple of places.

30:29.107 --> 30:31.575
You're a smart girl.
Why didn't you wear a condom?

30:31.667 --> 30:33.942
I do. Most of the time.

30:34.027 --> 30:37.383
You know what?
I made a mistake. She is not a smart girl.

30:37.467 --> 30:40.220
This is a terrible university.

30:40.787 --> 30:43.255
Do you ever wear
bright blue lipstick?

30:43.347 --> 30:46.225
Why? Is there a link
between the clap and blue lipstick?

30:46.307 --> 30:49.026
Let's discuss Ed Dekker.

30:50.907 --> 30:55.458
OK, yes. I gave gonorrhoea to Dekker.
Are you gonna arrest me?

30:55.547 --> 30:58.903
We know that RJ Manning
had the exact same strain.

30:58.987 --> 31:00.705
Did you give it to him too?

31:00.787 --> 31:04.746
I mean, do you have some sort of hate on
for the entire basketball team?

31:06.467 --> 31:09.584
RJ gave it to me.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.818
Then he wouldn't even talk to me.

31:12.907 --> 31:15.421
So I gave it to Ed Dekker, for revenge.

31:15.507 --> 31:19.978
Like, you know,
let RJ know I was still alive.

31:22.467 --> 31:26.824
Those guys all talk,
compare their conquests.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.462
You have a key to the bleachers.

31:31.547 --> 31:33.777
I didn't kill RJ!
I'm not that nuts!

31:34.747 --> 31:37.898
- We need a sample of your DNA.
- Why?

31:37.987 --> 31:39.978
Because just before he was killed,

31:40.067 --> 31:44.140
RJ was having sex with someone
who may have seen his murderer.

31:47.947 --> 31:51.940
You've got my snot,
my tears... and my hair!

31:52.507 --> 31:54.498
Knock yourself out!

31:57.587 --> 31:59.305
I don't understand.

31:59.387 --> 32:03.983
RJ Manning broke her heart -
and a bit of her brain in the process.

32:11.427 --> 32:15.136
Justine didn't leave her saliva or lipstick
on the victim's privates.

32:15.227 --> 32:19.186
OK, I'll help. But I do not want to be known
as the make-up expert around here.

32:19.267 --> 32:23.306
You found blue lipstick.
Chak-Rah by Zensual.

32:23.387 --> 32:25.378
"Zen" plus "sensual".

32:25.467 --> 32:27.742
Chakra. "Chak-Rah."

32:27.827 --> 32:30.341
Rah as in "rah rah",
as in "rah rah, sis boom bah".

32:30.427 --> 32:33.146
You started in English.
I don't know where you ended.

32:33.227 --> 32:37.425
This is marketed specifically to
high school and college cheering squads,

32:37.507 --> 32:39.145
tailored to their team colours.

32:39.227 --> 32:41.183
Ah, Atlantic State Jaguars.

32:41.267 --> 32:46.387
RJ Manning was under those bleachers
getting lipsticked by a cheerleader.

33:24.947 --> 33:27.461
- Do you know why we're doing this?
- I can guess.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.584
We found evidence
that one of the cheerleaders

33:30.667 --> 33:33.500
might have been with RJ
before he died.

33:34.587 --> 33:37.624
- Sexually.
- I know what "been with" means.

33:37.707 --> 33:41.143
You know,
the DNA will tell us if it was you.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.582
It wasn't.

33:43.667 --> 33:46.943
- Why isn't she upset?
- Oh, please.

33:47.027 --> 33:50.622
Oh, I get it. You think because
RJ compulsively played around,

33:50.707 --> 33:53.301
I might have lured him to his death
or something?

33:53.387 --> 33:55.343
Wow. She's smart.

33:55.427 --> 33:59.340
Well, do you want to pick out
anyone in particular here?

33:59.427 --> 34:03.022
Did you see RJ?
Before he was dead, I mean.

34:03.107 --> 34:05.177
He was a very good-looking guy.

34:05.267 --> 34:09.704
You factor in his sex drive and how he played,
half these girls have done him.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.822
Hell, he even did the towel girl.

34:11.907 --> 34:15.103
Wait. Do you know
about Justine Berry?

34:15.187 --> 34:20.500
RJ liked girls, all kinds of girls.
I'm just one kind.

34:21.786 --> 34:24.984
- Which kind is that?
- The permanent kind.

34:25.067 --> 34:26.978
You planned to live like that?

34:27.067 --> 34:32.016
RJ came home to me.
That's the way it would've stayed.

34:32.107 --> 34:36.658
From his crappy student apartment
to the giant mansion he would've gotten.

34:41.027 --> 34:45.020
Is she crying because she loved him
or because she lost a mansion?

34:50.187 --> 34:51.905
She decided to hang onto him

34:51.987 --> 34:55.980
by letting him have sex
with any other woman he wanted.

34:56.067 --> 35:00.697
- That sounds extremely rational.
- Well, that's what's confusing.

35:00.787 --> 35:02.186
Well done.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.020
The idea that one person
can be all things to another,

35:05.107 --> 35:10.784
satisfy every need, or even more than one,
is sentimental and mawkish.

35:11.867 --> 35:14.222
There are indentations here.

35:17.347 --> 35:20.498
Alpha-numeric. Z and S?

35:20.587 --> 35:23.147
It's an imprint.
It's... it's backwards.

35:24.067 --> 35:25.944
The numerals 2 and 5?

35:26.027 --> 35:28.700
25.

35:28.787 --> 35:31.904
25 pounds.

35:31.987 --> 35:35.059
An imprint from free weights.

35:37.027 --> 35:41.100
Our unknown female either meets
or lures RJ behind the bleachers.

35:41.187 --> 35:43.826
- Lures?
- We're pretty sure the girl didn't kill RJ.

35:43.907 --> 35:47.104
But that doesn't mean
that she wasn't bait.

35:47.187 --> 35:51.942
I got something. Blood spatter.
It was wiped, but it's definite.

35:52.667 --> 35:54.544
Looks like we have
our murder weapon.

35:57.107 --> 35:59.905
DNA evidence is in.
The blood is definitely RJ's.

35:59.987 --> 36:02.342
What about
the saliva and the sputum?

36:02.427 --> 36:04.497
- The loogie.
- I know about loogies.

36:04.587 --> 36:08.785
The saliva did not come from
the same person who provided the loogie.

36:08.867 --> 36:12.746
So the person who serviced RJ
is not the same person who spat on him.

36:12.827 --> 36:17.503
Two: We got a partial match on
the saliva from one of the cheerleaders.

36:17.587 --> 36:19.305
Celeste Cutler.

36:20.227 --> 36:22.695
You think Colby and I
plotted to kill RJ Manning?

36:22.787 --> 36:27.815
Celeste, you lured RJ Manning
under the bleachers and you kept him busy.

36:27.907 --> 36:29.101
Kept him busy how?

36:29.187 --> 36:31.860
Evidence shows
she was performing oral sex on him.

36:31.947 --> 36:34.381
Which gave you time
to bash his head in.

36:34.467 --> 36:37.106
-  But you made one mistake.
-  One.

36:37.187 --> 36:38.859
Look, I haven't done anything.

36:38.947 --> 36:42.417
We will match this DNA
to the sputum found at the scene.

36:42.507 --> 36:44.623
- What?
- You hawked a loogie on him, kid.

36:44.707 --> 36:46.504
You killed him
and spat on his face.

36:46.587 --> 36:50.341
Look, God as my witness,
that never happened.

36:51.907 --> 36:56.185
Sorry to interrupt,
but you really need to see this.

36:58.827 --> 37:01.341
-  Complete profile?
-  All 13 STRs.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.179
Thanks.

37:04.267 --> 37:09.057
We got a hit on CODIS from the DNA
on the, um... hawked loogie.

37:26.707 --> 37:28.379
Hey, Chief.

37:28.467 --> 37:31.186
If I hadn't spat on that son of a bitch,
you never would've caught me.

37:33.185 --> 37:35.176
- Well, Celeste might've told us.
- She doesn't know.

37:37.344 --> 37:42.179
I came in and...
saw my little girl,

37:42.264 --> 37:47.702
saw her with RJ,
doing what she was doing.

37:48.544 --> 37:50.341
She heard me and took off.

37:50.824 --> 37:54.612
None of the girls could resist RJ.

37:54.704 --> 37:57.537
Kid had it all.

37:57.624 --> 38:00.297
Magic boy.

38:01.304 --> 38:04.580
You know what else he had?
The clap.

38:05.344 --> 38:10.338
And he knew that when he took my daughter
underneath the...

38:12.264 --> 38:15.779
He's got a gun, Bones.
I need you to leave now.

38:15.864 --> 38:19.300
Don't worry.
It's not you I intend to shoot.

38:22.984 --> 38:27.136
There's no way Cutter Cutler kills himself,
no way he goes down without a fight.

38:27.224 --> 38:29.579
What are you doing?
You want him to shoot you?

38:29.664 --> 38:30.699
Go.

38:38.344 --> 38:40.983
I was just like him, you know?

38:42.624 --> 38:45.013
Under these same bleachers, in fact.

38:45.104 --> 38:47.493
I was as bad as him.

38:48.504 --> 38:50.859
You wouldn't understand.

38:52.104 --> 38:53.617
We were all like that.

38:53.704 --> 38:57.982
It changes your life view.
You see your little girl...

38:59.464 --> 39:01.580
It's a different perspective.

39:01.664 --> 39:05.657
People are gonna understand
the action that you took, OK?

39:05.744 --> 39:08.417
I do. Hey, man,
you're Cutter Cutler.

39:08.504 --> 39:12.895
Lowest assist and turnover ratios. Huh?

39:12.984 --> 39:15.373
12 triple doubles
in your last season.

39:15.464 --> 39:19.377
Nobody could change direction
in the open court like you, man. Nobody.

39:19.464 --> 39:22.103
No.

39:22.184 --> 39:25.654
Do it now.
Just change direction again.

39:35.384 --> 39:39.297
Cutter Cutler died a long time ago.

39:40.944 --> 39:43.094
I'm just putting him away.

39:53.984 --> 39:55.940
Ow.

39:57.864 --> 39:59.377
It's all right.

40:22.744 --> 40:25.816
- Your hand hurt?
- A little.

40:25.904 --> 40:31.137
- So, jock mentality, teams, not all bad, huh?
- Why are you telling me this?

40:31.224 --> 40:36.059
You said we're all stunted adolescents
who take children's games too seriously.

40:36.144 --> 40:38.260
I never meant you.

40:39.264 --> 40:40.697
- Bones...
- What?

40:40.784 --> 40:43.378
Bones, I'm one of those guys.

40:43.464 --> 40:49.175
No, you aren't. You don't play at
being a warrior, you <i>are</i> a warrior - every day.

40:49.264 --> 40:53.735
You're definitely...
a fully developed man.

40:57.584 --> 41:00.974
OK, OK. Yeah. You leave the tip.

41:02.264 --> 41:06.143
Even Cutler knew you were lying
when you said you treated women like that.

41:06.224 --> 41:08.533
- Oh, and you believe him?
- Yes.

41:08.624 --> 41:13.300
Because you still remember
that first girl's name.

41:18.624 --> 41:21.422
Let's go.

41:59.284 --> 42:00.603
What's that mean?
