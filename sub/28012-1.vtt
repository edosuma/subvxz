00:01.335 --> 00:03.871
ANNOUNCER: Free the innocent.
Find the guilty.

00:03.904 --> 00:06.707
-Are you sure
you want to poke the bear?
-I want to rip his heart out.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.710
ANNOUNCER: All-new episodes
of Proven Innocent Fridays.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.545
And check out
our other hit shows--

00:11.579 --> 00:14.315
The Resident, 9-1-1, and Empire.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.983
Only on Fox.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.863
(siren wailing in distance)

00:33.634 --> 00:35.636
(indistinct chatter)

00:39.873 --> 00:41.875
(engine stops)

00:47.481 --> 00:49.450
-(dog barking)
-(chain-link fence rattling)

00:49.483 --> 00:52.086
(snarling)

00:53.121 --> 00:55.123
(knocking on door)

00:57.425 --> 00:59.393
Caleb Greeves?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.197
Who the hell are you?

01:03.231 --> 01:04.898
I represent Harvey Birkbeck.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.570
(lock clicks)

01:10.804 --> 01:13.241
Harve still up
over at Statesville?

01:13.274 --> 01:15.643
Going on 27 years.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.378
That's a long time
to serve for a murder

01:17.411 --> 01:19.113
you and I both know
he didn't commit.

01:27.521 --> 01:28.789
I have a court order

01:28.822 --> 01:31.259
authorizing me to collect
a sample of your DNA.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.929
Bad idea coming here by
yourself, don't you think?

01:35.963 --> 01:37.565
People know I'm here, Caleb.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.833
You take me out, there's gonna
be ten more tomorrow

01:39.867 --> 01:41.769
and another ten the next day.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.438
It's the end of the road.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.939
Can't kill your way
out of this one.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.277
Says you, lady.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.521
(dialing)

02:00.554 --> 02:02.556
(line ringing)

02:03.824 --> 02:05.826
(dog whining)

02:15.336 --> 02:18.306
OPERATOR:
911. What is your emergency?

02:18.339 --> 02:21.141
(dog whines)

02:21.175 --> 02:23.477
What happens to a dog
when the owner dies?

02:23.511 --> 02:25.446
OPERATOR:
Ma'am, is there an emergency?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.148
Not anymore.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.727
VIOLET:
Good morning from Chicago.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.230
Once again we are recording
our weekly podcast

02:42.263 --> 02:43.897
from our offices
at the Injustice Defense Group,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.533
a law firm solely dedicated

02:45.566 --> 02:48.369
to the issue
of wrongful convictions.

02:48.402 --> 02:51.071
On this week's episode
of Until Proven Innocent,

02:51.104 --> 02:54.074
we're here with our regular
guest, and my boss,

02:54.107 --> 02:57.578
wrongful conviction attorney
Madeline Scott. Her recent

02:57.611 --> 02:59.213
discovery of DNA evidence

02:59.247 --> 03:02.583
has gotten Harvey Birkbeck
a new hearing

03:02.616 --> 03:04.418
after 27 years.

03:04.452 --> 03:07.355
Will an innocent man
finally get to go home?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.390
This is the first time you're
facing off against Gore Bellows

03:09.423 --> 03:12.426
since you became a lawyer
four years ago, correct?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.228
-Yes, it is.
-To the two people

03:14.262 --> 03:16.597
in the entire world
who don't know,

03:16.630 --> 03:18.732
Gore Bellows
is the very prosecutor

03:18.766 --> 03:20.200
who wrongfully convicted
Madeline

03:20.234 --> 03:23.271
and her brother Levi Scott
of the first-degree murder

03:23.304 --> 03:25.138
of her best friend
Rosemary Lynch.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.810
Are you nervous going up against
the man who put you away?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.580
No.

03:32.613 --> 03:37.017
His approach in my case
was so stunningly dishonest

03:37.050 --> 03:38.552
that any opportunity
to show the world

03:38.586 --> 03:40.421
that our white knight
state's attorney is really

03:40.454 --> 03:43.724
a corrupt liar is an opportunity
I'm eager to take.

03:43.757 --> 03:44.892
(knocking on window)

03:44.925 --> 03:47.461
And that is your law partner
Easy Boudreau,

03:47.495 --> 03:49.697
who I guess doesn't know
we're recording.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.031
Curious what he thinks
the headsets are for.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.368
This is Until Proven Innocent
with Violet Price,

03:54.402 --> 03:56.570
telling the stories
of the wrongfully accused

03:56.604 --> 03:58.105
and the lawyers
who represent them.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.140
Was it really necessary
to antagonize Bellows?

04:00.173 --> 04:01.975
It's always necessary.
And it's fun.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.311
"Fools give rise to their rage,

04:03.344 --> 04:06.714
but the wise bring calm
in the end." Proverbs.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.148
"I'm a sinner, I'm a saint,

04:08.181 --> 04:09.783
I do not feel ashamed."
Meredith Brooks.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.919
"I'm your hell, I'm your dream."

04:11.952 --> 04:13.621
BOTH:
"I'm nothing in between."

04:13.654 --> 04:15.556
While I hate to break up
this amazing rendition

04:15.589 --> 04:17.425
of late '90s feminist
alternative rock,

04:17.458 --> 04:18.559
-we've got to get to court.
-(dog barks)

04:18.592 --> 04:21.061
Yeah.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.996
Hey, Atticus.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.532
This is Atticus.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.535
What was I supposed to do?

04:29.169 --> 04:30.804
At least he's black.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.507
-(chuckling): Exactly.
-Sorry.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.909
* I'm a bitch, I'm a lover *

04:35.943 --> 04:38.278
-* I'm a child,
I'm a mother... *
-(shouting)

04:38.312 --> 04:41.114
MAN:
Keep it up, Madeline.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.282
MAN 2:
How'd you find the DNA?

04:42.316 --> 04:43.851
MAN 3:
Great work, Madeline.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.853
-Set him free, Madeline.
-Keep fighting
the good fight, Madeline!

04:47.988 --> 04:49.957
You okay, Harvey?

04:57.498 --> 04:59.700
DEPUTY SHERIFF:
All rise.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.135
The State v. Madeline

05:02.169 --> 05:05.373
and Levi Scott
will now proceed.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.345
DEPUTY SHERIFF:
All rise.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.717
The People v. Harvey Birkbeck.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.918
You may be seated.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.323
Counselor, you may proceed.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.729
Good morning, Your Honor.
On behalf of petitioner,

05:28.762 --> 05:30.798
we would like to submit
newly acquired DNA evidence...

05:30.831 --> 05:33.534
Your Honor,
may it please the court.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.902
The State withdraws
its objection

05:34.935 --> 05:36.504
to the release
of Mr. Harvey Birkbeck.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.741
Now, I realize
this is somewhat unusual,

05:40.774 --> 05:43.176
but in consideration
of this new DNA evidence,

05:43.210 --> 05:45.579
clearly a mistake has been made.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.549
Contrary to what Ms. Scott
would have the public believe,

05:48.582 --> 05:50.584
we prosecutors
are also human beings.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.353
Objection.
Assumes facts not in evidence.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.555
-(gallery laughing)
-(gavel bangs)

05:54.588 --> 05:56.023
Quiet, please.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.991
Mr. Bellows, continue.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.093
An injustice has been done.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.830
This man has spent
the better part of his life

06:02.863 --> 06:04.598
wrongfully imprisoned,

06:04.632 --> 06:06.366
and it gives me no greater joy
than to say,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.602
"It's time for you to go home."

06:08.636 --> 06:12.172
The State moves to vacate
Mr. Birkbeck's conviction

06:12.205 --> 06:13.941
of murder in the second degree.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.375
(gallery murmuring)

06:17.878 --> 06:20.280
Congratulations, Mr. Birkbeck,
you're a free man now.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.516
-Case is dismissed.
-(gallery cheering)

06:22.550 --> 06:24.452
Defendant is discharged.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.119
-(gallery cheering)
-MADELINE: You get to go home.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.563
JUDGE:
"We, the jury, in the above
entitled cause,

06:35.596 --> 06:37.030
"find the defendants

06:37.064 --> 06:40.934
"Madeline Scott
and Levi Scott guilty

06:40.968 --> 06:42.470
-"of the crime of murder...
-No.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.637
of Rosemary Lynch."

06:43.671 --> 06:46.239
-No, we're innocent.
-Your Honor, please.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.475
-We're innocent.
-Your Honor, please.

06:47.508 --> 06:48.876
-No. No, Your Honor!
-MADELINE: I would never hurt...

06:48.909 --> 06:50.644
(gallery talking indistinctly)

06:50.678 --> 06:52.312
We're innocent.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.847
Your Honor, please.
No!

06:54.848 --> 06:55.983
BELLOWS:
Well done, Maddie.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.885
I always wanted to tell you

06:57.918 --> 06:59.887
that your case was
never personal for me.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.321
I was just doing my job

07:01.354 --> 07:02.823
and I honestly thought
you were guilty.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.425
-In fact, I still do.
-WOMAN: Mr. Bellows.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.660
-MAN: Mr. Bellows.
-WOMAN: Mr. Bellows, sir.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.328
MAN:
How about a quick comment?

07:08.361 --> 07:09.963
(reporters clamoring)

07:09.997 --> 07:12.265
What is that snake up to?

07:12.299 --> 07:15.235
EASY:
Bellows wants to avoid
the humiliation and be the hero.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.170
It's pretty clever, actually.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.240
Well, the real question is why.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.676
VIOLET:
Today's Until Proven Innocent
is being recorded

07:22.710 --> 07:25.078
at the Performing Arts Center
for our first annual

07:25.112 --> 07:27.815
Injustice Defense Group
fund-raiser.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.850
(audience cheering, whooping)

07:31.318 --> 07:33.453
Now, the whole world knows

07:33.487 --> 07:35.689
that Madeline got
her bachelor's degree

07:35.723 --> 07:37.090
during her ten years in prison,

07:37.124 --> 07:39.092
and upon her release attended
Yale Law School,

07:39.126 --> 07:41.294
graduating top of her class.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.465
But what most people
don't realize

07:45.499 --> 07:47.535
is that her lawyer wasn't even
a criminal defense lawyer

07:47.568 --> 07:50.103
when he took on
her infamous case.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.540
Nope.
Reinsurance regulation.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.842
-(laughter)
-VIOLET: So what happened?

07:54.875 --> 07:56.276
EASY:
Uh, truth be told,

07:56.309 --> 07:58.378
I thought she was guilty
like everyone else did.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.783
Then Maddie sent me a letter.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.452
The letter said,
"Please do not look away

08:05.485 --> 08:07.120
without at least
hearing my story."

08:07.154 --> 08:09.489
I was so surprised,
I thought perhaps

08:09.523 --> 08:13.360
this is the one case
meant for me.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.828
And so I decided to follow

08:14.862 --> 08:16.664
the Lord's guidance
and not look away.

08:16.697 --> 08:20.300
After a few months working
together, I asked her about

08:20.333 --> 08:24.572
the number she'd written at the
bottom of my special letter.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.775
2,736.

08:29.543 --> 08:32.179
Turns out, that was the number

08:32.212 --> 08:33.581
of letters she'd sent
before mine.

08:33.614 --> 08:37.150
I realized right then that I had
discovered my purpose.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.588
Because if 2,735 trained lawyers

08:40.621 --> 08:43.691
would ignore an innocent girl
whose case was famous,

08:43.724 --> 08:47.360
who was gonna fight for
the innocent people behind bars

08:47.394 --> 08:49.329
who weren't famous?

08:49.362 --> 08:51.965
(cheering, whooping)

08:53.801 --> 08:57.270
Now, Rosemary Lynch
was brutally murdered

08:57.304 --> 09:00.307
and yet her killer
was never found.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.279
That's correct.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.449
When someone goes to prison
for a murder they didn't commit,

09:09.482 --> 09:12.452
it means the real murderer
is still out there.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.722
(indistinct chatter)

09:14.755 --> 09:16.023
Same contribution as last year?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.958
-Absolutely.
-Maybe a little more?

09:17.991 --> 09:19.727
My cover is a billionaire donor
tonight.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.094
That's why I bought this hat.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.362
It's not very believable.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.064
-How are you?
-Good, how are you?

09:24.097 --> 09:25.633
Dylan, hi.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.300
Hey.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.469
-Thank you for coming.
-(sighs) Yeah, of course.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.972
Where's Becky?
Sh-She couldn't make it?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.140
Oh, you didn't hear.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.776
She, um...

09:35.809 --> 09:38.211
She dumped me.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.648
-What?
-Yeah.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.250
That's crazy.
You're like a rom-com character.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.985
(chuckles)
What do you mean?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.987
Well, just, you know,
you're handsome,

09:47.020 --> 09:49.422
and you have a beard
and a sexy reporter job.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.660
Uh, well, unfortunately, she did
not feel that way about the job.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.628
She hated the job.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.764
It was just, um...

09:56.797 --> 09:58.766
I don't know,
it was just too much travel.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.835
If my boyfriend was covering the
Middle East, I'd be in heaven.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.804
Just... just when you start
to annoy me,

10:03.837 --> 10:05.673
you leave town.
Dreamy.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.908
Well, then maybe you and I
should go out sometime.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.610
(laughs)
That's good.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.946
-You're hilarious.
-Hmm.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.750
(chuckling):
I'm gonna go get a...

10:16.784 --> 10:19.152
I'm gonna go get a drink.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.688
I thought you didn't drink.

10:20.721 --> 10:21.789
You know,
I think I'm gonna start.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.356
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.392
(grunts)

10:29.963 --> 10:32.265
Don't be nervous, honey.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.467
You're gonna crush this.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.004
We don't have enough
of a presence in Springfield.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.606
The numbers are still
too low downstate.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.809
We've got plenty of time,
and when we're through,

10:41.842 --> 10:46.179
your opponents will be scattered
into piles of ashes.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.482
Nobody does metaphor
quite like you do, my love.

10:49.516 --> 10:51.819
Now...

10:51.852 --> 10:53.653
Big smile, dear.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.889
(crowd cheering)

10:55.923 --> 10:59.459
It is with great pride
and great humility

10:59.492 --> 11:02.629
that I announce my candidacy
for attorney general

11:02.662 --> 11:04.832
to the great state of Illinois.

11:04.865 --> 11:09.002
If elected, I promise
to enforce law and order,

11:09.036 --> 11:12.906
ensure that no crime
will go unpunished.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.908
So that's what he was up to.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.476
Our last two AGs
became governor.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.978
We can't let that happen.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.346
Hey, if you go after him
in the press,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.580
it'll come across like revenge.

11:20.613 --> 11:21.681
Not if I do it in court.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.850
What are you talking about?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.752
-You want to sue him?
-No, expose him.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.254
You know Harvey Birkbeck and I
aren't the only

11:27.287 --> 11:28.588
two innocent people
he's thrown in jail.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.990
And there'll be a heck
of a lot more

11:30.023 --> 11:32.092
-if he's elected
attorney general.
-Exactly.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.161
We need to sink his AG campaign
before it begins.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.397
Let's find another one
of his wrongful convictions--

11:37.430 --> 11:40.367
something really high-profile--
and jam it down his throat.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.701
Are you sure you want
to poke the bear?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.771
No, I want to rip his heart out.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.438
How many innocent lives
has he destroyed?

11:45.472 --> 11:46.573
I don't think
it's a great idea,

11:46.606 --> 11:47.607
but I think
somebody ought to...

11:49.743 --> 11:52.579
This man doesn't get to be
attorney general.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.387
DETECTIVE (on video):
Lucia, why did you
set the fire?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.622
Because my little Angel
told me to.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.894
He spoke to me.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.197
He said he was ready
to go to Heaven.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.799
(Lucia laughing)

12:17.337 --> 12:19.139
You seriously want to defend

12:19.172 --> 12:21.141
the Wicked Witch
of West Pullman?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.811
The woman murdered her own child
by burning down her house

12:23.844 --> 12:26.313
-and then confessed to it.
-We'd have a better chance

12:26.346 --> 12:28.315
exonerating the ghost
of Charles Manson.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.783
I know it's not a great case,

12:29.817 --> 12:31.885
but her PCR hearing is
in less than two months.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.921
The timing is perfect,
and it's high-profile enough

12:33.954 --> 12:35.655
that we'll get a ton of press.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.457
This is a disaster
waiting to happen.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.658
Everyone loved hating her.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.160
Just like they loved hating me.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.995
Lucia Rincon was convicted

12:42.029 --> 12:44.164
because of this image
of her, right?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.466
-The satanic goth queen?
-EASY: Correct.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.970
What if I told you...

12:50.003 --> 12:52.806
she was really a preacher's wife

12:52.840 --> 12:54.574
who was never into goth?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.944
So, then what was
with all the goth makeup?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.178
It wasn't makeup.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.347
It was soot from the fire.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.016
They didn't clean her up
before the confession.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.184
Eyewitness accounts
have her getting

13:04.217 --> 13:05.618
some sort of injection
on the scene.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.855
(panting, sobbing)

13:07.888 --> 13:09.857
And let me guess, her toxicology
report has disappeared.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.691
Vanished in the wind.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.026
I think we found our case.

13:14.061 --> 13:16.997
(indistinct chatter)

13:18.631 --> 13:20.033
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

13:25.738 --> 13:27.307
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A. speakers)

13:32.846 --> 13:34.414
EASY:
You okay?

13:35.415 --> 13:36.917
Yeah.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.589
Best years of my life.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.896
LUCIA:
To this day,

13:48.929 --> 13:52.065
I don't know why my baby's dead.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.567
I don't know why I confessed.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.337
I play it over in my head.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.339
Why did I do that?

13:59.372 --> 14:01.374
Since the advent
of DNA evidence,

14:01.408 --> 14:05.178
about 2,000 inmates have
been proven innocent and freed.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.415
More than 500 of them
had been coerced

14:08.448 --> 14:10.083
into falsely confessing.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.985
EASY:
So, Lucia,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.320
can you tell us
what happened that night?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.188
I don't remember anything.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.891
I was never into... goth.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.927
I-I-I didn't even know
what that was.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.861
Bellows did
the same thing to me.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.663
You know,
the night Rosemary died was

14:23.696 --> 14:25.198
the first night
I ever got drunk.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.766
What?

14:26.799 --> 14:30.603
I thought you were
some crazy party girl.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.440
Behind every media caricature is
a real-life human being, right?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.508
That man is a monster.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.845
Lucia, you have a hearing
in six weeks.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.949
We'd like to be your lawyers
at that hearing.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.784
(exhaling quickly)

14:48.821 --> 14:50.023
This guy's kind of cute.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.193
Ah, yeah. He's like Daddy
Warbucks if he was a eunuch.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.028
Sometimes that's preferable.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.064
-(laughs)
-Sorry, am I interrupting?

14:57.097 --> 14:59.799
We're just analyzing Violet's
reckless dating app behavior.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.902
Says our investigator
holding a sword.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.605
It's a replica
of a 16th century katana.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.474
What got you into this stuff?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.742
-Kill Bill part two.
-Oh, is that what got you
into wrongful convictions?

15:09.776 --> 15:12.479
-No. It was Kill Bill part one.
-(laughs)

15:12.512 --> 15:15.983
Engine Company 93 originally
investigated the fire.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.617
I want you to go down there.
Dig around.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.652
See if you can find out
how the fire got started.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.755
Perfect. I'll go undercover
as a recruit.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.158
I don't think that's necessary.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.160
It's always necessary.
(chuckles)

15:28.295 --> 15:29.896
VIOLET:
Maddie, I want to show you

15:29.929 --> 15:33.066
what I've been working on
for the new press release.

15:33.100 --> 15:36.970
Our plan is to show how Bellows
used the media to demonize you.

15:37.004 --> 15:39.172
Exactly like
he's doing to Lucia.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.408
(singsongy):
You, I like you.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.243
No.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.012
Absolutely not.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.180
I don't want to make
this story about me.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.448
Maddie.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.583
We have to make this about you.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.585
You are the living,
breathing example

15:52.619 --> 15:54.454
of what Bellows
is doing to Lucia.

15:54.487 --> 15:55.688
EASY:
She's right.

15:55.722 --> 15:56.956
-You're our best asset.
-Right now

15:56.990 --> 15:58.025
you're our only asset.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.292
It's a terrible case.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.465
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

16:05.498 --> 16:08.301
Oh, are you seeing anyone,
Maddie?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.273
-You know that I'm not, Mom.
-Well...

16:13.306 --> 16:15.375
you're not gonna be
young forever.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.278
-Burn.
-You've been out of prison
for seven years.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.214
-Your whole life
can't just be about your cases.
-Well, actually,

16:21.248 --> 16:23.883
there's, uh, one that I need
to talk to you all about.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.887
-Who is it, honey?
-Her name is Lucia Rincon.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.323
Bellows is the prosecutor.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.126
And I know our case
is gonna come up,

16:33.160 --> 16:36.063
-because it's part
of our defense strategy.
-JACK: Why do you want

16:36.096 --> 16:37.464
to talk about
that nightmare again?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.066
I don't.
But this woman is innocent.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.868
So if I have to drag my name
through the mud

16:41.901 --> 16:44.237
to save her,
that's just what I'm gonna do.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.905
But what about your brother?
He hasn't been able

16:45.938 --> 16:47.674
to get a decent job
because of what happened.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.409
Hey, I'm fine.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.910
Coaching kids' soccer
is nice, but...

16:50.943 --> 16:54.581
-Wow. Okay. Thanks, Mom.
-MADELINE: I think it's great.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.417
-Thank you. It is great.
-HELEN: You can't do this
to us again.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.419
Our lives have
just gotten back to normal.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.920
Hey, we're the ones
that went to prison, okay?

17:00.953 --> 17:02.755
So if she wants to talk
about the case,

17:02.789 --> 17:05.092
then she can talk
about the case.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.595
-And I want you to crush
that son of a bitch for me.
-For us.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.097
For us.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.931
JACK:
I'm worried about you, Maddie.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.201
Are you sure
you really want to do this?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.770
Ever since I saw Bellows,

17:17.804 --> 17:20.507
I can't stop thinking
about Rosemary.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.375
(takes deep breath)

17:22.409 --> 17:25.044
Seeing him
triggered something in me.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.615
We've all spent so many years
trying to forget about this.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.218
It never goes away, does it?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.522
I don't think it ever will.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.059
(Young Madeline gasps softly)

17:44.164 --> 17:46.266
(gasps softly)

17:46.299 --> 17:49.469
("Sleep Alone" by Bat for Lashes
playing)

17:54.174 --> 17:55.608
* Last night's parties... *

17:55.642 --> 17:57.043
ROSEMARY:
I bet Tobey

17:57.076 --> 17:59.479
would totally hook up with you
in that dress.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.315

and kissing *

18:05.618 --> 18:08.087

YOUNG MADELINE:

Come on, just one sip.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.760

TV NEWSWOMAN: Now with
renowned innocence attorney

18:35.215 --> 18:38.818
Madeline Scott at her side,
Rincon is heading back to court

18:38.851 --> 18:41.288
for round two of her infamous

18:41.321 --> 18:42.822
trial by fire.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.924
And the Supreme Court
has also held

18:44.957 --> 18:47.360
that fantastic
or delusional claims

18:47.394 --> 18:50.129
of actual innocence should be
dismissed by judges

18:50.163 --> 18:52.031
as frivolous
and patently without...

18:52.064 --> 18:53.366
Hey, uh...

18:53.400 --> 18:56.336
what do you make
of this Luciferina deal?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.371
Arson? Not arson?

18:58.405 --> 19:00.373
Those judges wouldn't know
deliberate

19:00.407 --> 19:03.876
from an accidental combustion
if you set their robes on fire.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.378
(laughs)

19:05.412 --> 19:08.381
That fire was 2004, wasn't it?

19:08.415 --> 19:10.049
Yes, it was, Chief.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.884
December 2004.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.987
So there you have it.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.290
Why? What...
what happened in 2004?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.392
Charcoal Christmas, son.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.028
But for this small
suburb of Chicago,

19:22.061 --> 19:24.231
the murder of Rosemary Lynch
is still a hot...

19:24.264 --> 19:25.332
All right, let's go, let's go!

19:25.365 --> 19:26.333
Hustle it up now!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.634
Keep your head up!
There you go!

19:27.667 --> 19:30.136
Nice shot! Hey, great save!
There you go!

19:30.169 --> 19:33.340
Come on. Go meet up
with your friends, honey.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.408
-Good effort, good effort. Give
me some fives. There you go.
-Levi! Levi!

19:35.442 --> 19:36.809
Why is your sister defending

19:36.843 --> 19:40.012
that psycho
who set her kid on fire?

19:40.046 --> 19:43.015
You-You'll have
to talk to her about that.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.184
She is using Rosemary.
It's disgusting.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.320
What is wrong with you people?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.021
Can we not talk
about this here, please?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.257
I-I'm-I'm trying
to coach soccer.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.592
We are never gonna forget
what you and your sister

19:52.625 --> 19:55.262
did to Rosemary. Ever.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.696
Come on, Brian.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.598
LEVI:
We'll see you next week.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.571
BOY:
Bye, Coach Levi!

20:04.604 --> 20:05.805
Hey.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.576
BRIAN:
Hey, Levi.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.012
What are you doing here?

20:13.045 --> 20:16.048
No one wants you here.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.884
We don't want you
around our kids.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.686
You know,
assault with a deadly weapon

20:19.719 --> 20:22.522
can get you up to ten years.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.691
Maybe life if you kill me.

20:24.724 --> 20:27.627
Is that what you want, Brian?
You want to sit in a cell

20:27.660 --> 20:29.796
for the rest of your life
just dreaming

20:29.829 --> 20:31.731
about all the things
that you missed out on,

20:31.764 --> 20:34.166
like your wife, or your kids?

20:35.568 --> 20:38.571
Just a couple beers.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.640
A good steak.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.812
Why don't you move over and...

20:45.845 --> 20:48.515
we'll both just pretend
this whole thing didn't happen.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.890
(grunting)

20:57.924 --> 20:59.659
Oh, my God! Brian!

20:59.692 --> 21:02.094
Brian! Are you okay?

21:02.128 --> 21:03.630
(groans)
Babe.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.199
(panting)

21:08.100 --> 21:09.268
Are you all right?

21:09.302 --> 21:10.503
(Brian groans)

21:11.704 --> 21:13.139
(grunting)

21:31.391 --> 21:32.892
(panting)

21:34.327 --> 21:36.863
(indistinct chatter)

21:38.798 --> 21:41.167
(clears throat):
Heather.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.536
Hi.

21:43.570 --> 21:46.038
What are you doing here?

21:46.072 --> 21:49.542
Your drug addict brother
nearly killed me and my husband.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.878
I take it you're defending him?

21:51.911 --> 21:54.581
-He's been clean for years.
-Good for him.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.885
Wait, Brian Husband
is your husband?

21:58.918 --> 22:00.219
Yeah.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.055
Oh, it's just...

22:03.089 --> 22:05.224
now your name
is Heather Husband.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.060
I'm glad you've recovered enough
from Rosemary's death

22:08.094 --> 22:10.129
to make everything a big joke.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.231
You know, most of us in town

22:12.264 --> 22:14.501
still think
you should be in jail.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.503
We always will.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.571
Well, sometimes I miss lockup,
'cause, you know,

22:18.605 --> 22:21.474
kind of cool to beat the hell
out of a dumb bitch

22:21.508 --> 22:23.009
who looked at you wrong.

22:23.042 --> 22:27.514
Well, you know all about being
a dumb bitch, now, don't you?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.917
You know, I always thought
that maybe you were the one

22:30.950 --> 22:33.352
-that killed Rosemary.
-What?

22:33.386 --> 22:35.254
You were definitely
the queen bee back in the day,

22:35.287 --> 22:38.157
but you knew you were
never getting out of La Grange.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.692
And you should've seen your face

22:39.726 --> 22:41.594
the day Rosemary
was accepted to Stanford.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.262
(elevator bell dings)

22:43.295 --> 22:45.832
Well, it looks like
she didn't quite make it,

22:45.865 --> 22:48.300
now, did she?

22:53.606 --> 22:56.308
See you in court, Maddie.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.384
Mr. Scott, where is your sister?

23:06.318 --> 23:07.787
She should be here soon,
Your Honor.

23:07.820 --> 23:11.390
Madeline Scott, Your Honor,
counsel for the defendant.

23:11.424 --> 23:13.993
(whispers):
Sorry, bud.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.564
And how do you plead?

23:17.597 --> 23:21.300
As always in our family,
not guilty, Your Honor.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.802
(gallery chuckles)

23:22.835 --> 23:24.336
(gavel bangs)

23:29.341 --> 23:30.577
-Hi.
-Hey.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.679
Hi.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.215
Can we, uh,
can we talk about Rincon?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.718
Oh, is that what
you're doing here?

23:38.751 --> 23:41.287
Well, we got a lot of readers
that love the Goth Killer.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.155
I'm metro now.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.591
-Oh.
-So...

23:44.624 --> 23:47.226
I guess your international
dream guy scenario is over.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.661
Yeah, you're still dreamy
on this continent,

23:48.695 --> 23:49.829
but I can't discuss it.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.264
All right, new idea.
How about this?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.933
How about I take you to dinner,

23:53.966 --> 23:56.503
and I give the story
to somebody else?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.270
You would lose a story
for a date?

23:58.304 --> 24:00.507
I would lose a Pulitzer
for a date with you.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.075
-Are you kidding me? Come on.
-(both chuckle)

24:03.109 --> 24:05.177
Oh, you're good.

24:05.211 --> 24:08.515
I can't. I...

24:08.548 --> 24:09.916
I, uh...

24:09.949 --> 24:11.784
You know what?
You're not missing anything.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.052
I'm terrible in bed.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.256
That's a true story.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.559
(laughs)

24:33.840 --> 24:35.575
Easy.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.445
I've been looking into Lucia's
missing toxicology file.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.047
So, this is
the medical examiner report

24:41.080 --> 24:42.549
from Lucia's case.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.618
-You see that?
-Yeah. It's a photocopy
of a staple.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.119
Right. But that's the only page,

24:47.153 --> 24:49.388
and it says the toxicology
report is attached.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.390
If there's a photocopy
of a staple...

24:51.423 --> 24:53.392
It was hidden in discovery.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.694
And we never figured out

24:54.727 --> 24:56.228
what she was injected with
at the crime scene.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.897
-Mm-hmm.
-It's got to be in there, right?

24:57.930 --> 24:59.165
Yeah, if we can find it.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.234
What about the EMT
who treated her at the scene?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.570
Maybe she can get it for us.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.937
She's listed right here
on the report.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.077
You got it wrong.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.912
I didn't inject Mrs. Rincon
with anything.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.081
I drew her blood.
It's standard procedure.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.850
Can you get us the complete
toxicology report that says

25:17.884 --> 25:19.586
-what her blood showed?
-I'm sorry.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.320
I can't help you.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.855
I know it's a lot to ask,
but our client

25:22.889 --> 25:25.858
lost her son, her husband,
and her freedom.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.860
She lost everything.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.599
EASY:
Great news.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.701
The paramedic found her soul
and gave us

25:34.734 --> 25:37.269
Lucia's lab report, which shows
she was hallucinating

25:37.303 --> 25:39.271
from carbon monoxide poisoning.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.007
MADELINE:
So her entire
satanic public image

25:41.040 --> 25:42.842
was in reality
a woman who was poisoned.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.777
And Bellows buried the blood
test that would prove it.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.446
-We just destroyed
Lucia's confession.
-(laughs)

25:47.479 --> 25:48.781
Bingo.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.783
All right,
I got good news and bad news.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.018
Oh, we're playing
this game again.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.219
Yeah, because I love it.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.520
Which one do you want first?

25:54.553 --> 25:55.554
ALL:
The bad news.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.556
(sighs)
I'm not gonna be a fireman

25:57.590 --> 25:58.858
with Engine Company 93.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.392
-Shocking.
-What's the good news?

26:00.426 --> 26:02.795
Firefighters know everything
about arson. Who knew?

26:02.829 --> 26:04.731
-I knew.
-In 2005,
a Jersey-based importer

26:04.764 --> 26:06.599
was hit with a class action suit

26:06.633 --> 26:08.067
claiming their faulty
Christmas tree lights

26:08.100 --> 26:10.637
caused more
than 60 Christmas tree fires.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.639
They called it
Charcoal Christmas.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.406
Looks like Lucia's fire
was an accident

26:14.440 --> 26:16.242
caused by faulty
Christmas tree lights.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.044
-Can we prove she owned them?
-You mean,

26:18.077 --> 26:20.412
did she run back into a burning
house to save a box of receipts?

26:20.446 --> 26:22.548
-Probably not.
-Okay, wait,

26:22.581 --> 26:24.617
but for the first time
we have a logical explanation

26:24.651 --> 26:25.818
for how the fire started.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.754
All right.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.722
I'll amend our petition
to include Bellows' suppression

26:29.756 --> 26:32.659
of the toxicology report
and make sure that I file it...

26:32.692 --> 26:34.393
No, no, no.
We can't file anything yet.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.996
Bellows could cut a deal
to keep this off the record.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.331
Hiding a damaging blood test
is enough to show

26:39.365 --> 26:42.601
how corrupt his case was
and blow up his AG campaign.

26:42.635 --> 26:43.803
I know you want
to humiliate him,

26:43.836 --> 26:45.672
but what matters is Lucia.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.074
We have enough information
for him to release her.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.742
I hate Bellows, too,

26:49.776 --> 26:53.445
but we have to protect
our client above all else.

26:53.479 --> 26:55.181
Yeah.

26:55.214 --> 26:58.084
Okay.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.852
Go to Bellows,
see if he'll cut a deal.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.931
Nice spot for a jog.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.700
Especially this early,

27:13.733 --> 27:15.201
before all the carbon monoxide

27:15.234 --> 27:16.368
chokes the oxygen
out of the air.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.706
Lucia Rincon's confession.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.841
She was suffering
from carbon monoxide poisoning

27:21.874 --> 27:23.275
when she gave it.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.211
I have the hidden blood test
to prove it.

27:25.244 --> 27:27.847
Look, I know you all think

27:27.880 --> 27:30.282
I'm the villain in your story.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.284
May I ask you a question?

27:32.318 --> 27:33.786
You ever taken the statement
of a mother

27:33.820 --> 27:35.521
whose child
has just been murdered?

27:37.189 --> 27:38.691
I have.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.461
At least a hundred times.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.530
Never forget the look
in their eyes,

27:44.563 --> 27:48.200
the look that says that
their lives are now over, too.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.636
Only thing I can do to make sure
I can still sleep at night

27:50.669 --> 27:54.573
is punish the killer
of their child.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.608
What about
when you get it wrong?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.513
Madeline Scott is guilty.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.816
So is Rincon.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.885
Even if you can get her released
with that report,

28:05.918 --> 28:07.186
she still killed her kid.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.654
She didn't kill him,

28:08.687 --> 28:11.657
but the fact
that you suppressed this report

28:11.690 --> 28:13.092
will certainly kill
your campaign.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.962
So either way, you lose.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.932
(chuckles):
That's a good one, Easy.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.836
She pleads to manslaughter,

28:23.870 --> 28:26.906
I'll make sure her sentence
is reduced to time served.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.440
The report stays buried.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.877
She pleads
to child endangerment.

28:33.980 --> 28:37.850
If, in your crusade,

28:37.884 --> 28:40.953
you manage to free someone
who's actually guilty

28:40.987 --> 28:42.721
and then they murder someone

28:42.755 --> 28:46.525
or otherwise ruin
innocent lives,

28:46.558 --> 28:49.796
then who's the villain
in your story?

28:49.829 --> 28:52.331
You have a deal.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.304
LUCIA:
What?

28:58.337 --> 29:00.206
-Really?
-You're being offered
what's called

29:00.239 --> 29:01.740
the Alford plea.

29:01.774 --> 29:04.310
If you plead guilty
to child endangerment,

29:04.343 --> 29:07.313
you'll be released
based on timed served.

29:07.346 --> 29:10.316
But everyone will still think
I'm the Goth Killer?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.751
What do you think I should do?

29:13.786 --> 29:16.055
I was offered a plea in my case.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.824
I turned it down.

29:17.857 --> 29:20.326
I would rather be in prison

29:20.359 --> 29:22.228
than have the world think
I was a murderer.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.830
And you won in court?

29:23.863 --> 29:25.564
My conviction was overturned.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.433
And if this happens,

29:27.466 --> 29:29.068
they can't retry me

29:29.101 --> 29:31.337
-because of the
double jeopardy thing.
-No, no, no, no.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.739
Double jeopardy only applies
if you're found innocent

29:33.772 --> 29:37.509
at trial or deemed actually
innocent based on appeal.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.511
Yeah, but Bellows cares too much
about his political ambitions

29:39.545 --> 29:40.746
to risk another loss.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.748
I would be stunned
if he tried you again.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.251
My husband left me

29:45.284 --> 29:48.187
because he thought
I killed our baby.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.456
He made a statement against me
in court.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.392
I lost everything.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.697
MADELINE:
Lucia, what do you want to do?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.732
I want to go to court.

30:05.671 --> 30:06.873
(whistle blows)

30:06.906 --> 30:09.608
-COACH: You take the kick.
-Right.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.110
-Way to go, Tim. Way to go.
-WOMAN: Yeah, there you go!

30:11.143 --> 30:13.045
(chuckles)
Yeah, that's the way.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.680
All right. Pass it over.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.715
Hey, Levi.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.851
Hey, Coach. What's up?

30:18.885 --> 30:21.287
Hey, look, um,
I-I hate to do this,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.155
but we're gonna
have to let you go.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.124
Wh-What? Why?

30:25.157 --> 30:28.060
That thing with Brian Husband
pushed a lot of people

30:28.094 --> 30:29.328
over the edge.

30:29.361 --> 30:32.131
You know, I tried to fight it,
but, uh, you know,

30:32.164 --> 30:33.832
with the prison thing
and-and the drugs...

30:33.866 --> 30:37.036
No, no. Hey. Coach,
I've been off oxy for years.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.370
I have, you...

30:38.404 --> 30:40.806
Frank, you know
this is all I got.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.342
You know I love these kids.
Don't-don't do this to me.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.177
I'm sorry, Levi.

30:45.211 --> 30:48.047
-I'm sorry.
-Frank, please don't.

30:50.082 --> 30:52.084
(siren wailing in distance)

30:56.055 --> 30:58.024
ROSEMARY: Do you want
to be a virgin in college?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.591
No. Do you?

30:59.625 --> 31:02.962
No. So let's get it over with.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.600
(phone buzzing)

31:08.634 --> 31:10.836
Hey.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.704
Hi.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.207
Um, I was thinking about

31:15.241 --> 31:18.210
your offer, and I...

31:19.979 --> 31:24.750
...I can't promise
that it won't be super awkward,

31:24.783 --> 31:26.552
um, but maybe...

31:28.120 --> 31:30.122
-...if you want
to have dinner, then...
-Yes.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.124
I-I definitely want to.
I would love to.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.560
Uh, Saturday.
How about Saturday night?

31:34.593 --> 31:36.028
-Okay.
-All right.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.130
-I'll pick you up.
-Great.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.531
Okay, bye.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.468
(chuckles)

31:48.407 --> 31:50.309
I got a line on Madeline Scott.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.311
I love it.
Bring me something good.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.713
Well, you know I will.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.682
(man speaking Spanish)

32:05.591 --> 32:07.426
What's up? You okay?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.162
Yeah, will you look at this?

32:11.197 --> 32:13.265
Lucia's husband.

32:13.299 --> 32:15.667
All his preaching
is exclusively in Spanish.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.604
So? The police report said
that he didn't speak English.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.107
Yeah, but his statement
is in flawless English.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.744
I couldn't stop thinking

32:25.777 --> 32:27.246
about Lucia's husband.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.681
Why would he give a statement
that she never wanted children

32:29.715 --> 32:30.849
-if it wasn't true?
-Right, so we looked back

32:30.882 --> 32:32.784
to Rincon's original statement
to the police.

32:32.818 --> 32:35.854
-It's written
in flawless English.
-And?

32:35.887 --> 32:37.689
He probably couldn't even read
what he was signing.

32:38.824 --> 32:40.359
Translator could have
written anything.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.693
All right, we need to confirm

32:41.727 --> 32:44.296
this is actually what he said,
and if not,

32:44.330 --> 32:46.032
we need to get him on the record
refuting it.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.266
But first we have to find him.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.235
(laughs):
Yeah, good luck with that.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.572
On it.

32:56.575 --> 32:58.577
(Easy sighs)

33:04.316 --> 33:06.152
How could you get her
to reject the plea?

33:07.586 --> 33:09.555
You risked our client's life
on a long shot appeal

33:09.588 --> 33:11.457
over a personal vendetta
with Bellows.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.858
I don't see it that way.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.626
I'm the only one

33:14.660 --> 33:16.328
who's been through
what Lucia's been through.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.563
Which does not give you
the right

33:17.596 --> 33:19.565
to manipulate her
into risking her own freedom

33:19.598 --> 33:21.800
so you can continue
to grind your ax.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.236
I didn't manipulate her.
I empathized with her.

33:29.775 --> 33:32.744
In prison,
no one is spitting at Lucia.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.280
You want her
to go back to all that?

33:35.947 --> 33:39.751
Who's gonna hire a woman
who murdered her own child?

33:39.785 --> 33:41.987
Who will love that woman?
No one.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.056
Because that is the world
that is waiting for her

33:44.090 --> 33:46.825
if she accepts a plea
that admits any wrongdoing.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.760
That's the life sentence
that terrifies me.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.663
She'll be free.

33:51.697 --> 33:54.032
Isn't that the entire point
of this firm?

33:54.066 --> 33:56.935
Lucia's not fighting for
her freedom, and neither am I.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.438
She's fighting
for her innocence.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.810
And so are we.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.814
(phone buzzing)

34:15.921 --> 34:17.556
Hey, big brother.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.292
LEVI:
Hey, hey. Hey, sis.

34:20.326 --> 34:22.461
Levi, you promised.

34:22.494 --> 34:26.298
Um... promises, promises.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.434
Why?

34:28.467 --> 34:30.136
You were doing so well.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.738
I can't help it.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.574
I miss her.

34:35.607 --> 34:36.942
(inhales, exhales sharply)

34:36.975 --> 34:40.246
She was my best friend, too,
and I'm not a drug addict.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.485
We were more than friends.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.220
What?

34:48.254 --> 34:50.256
I never told you.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.558
I never told anyone.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.060
We were together.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.095
(breath quivering)

34:58.697 --> 35:00.666
You and Rosemary?

35:00.699 --> 35:01.933
(indistinct chatter)

35:01.967 --> 35:03.402
MADELINE:
You swore

35:03.435 --> 35:05.337
-you were never together.
-I know.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.905
-You lied to me.
-I know.

35:06.938 --> 35:10.609
I'm sorry, sis.
It was... it was our secret.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.678
If this gets out,

35:12.711 --> 35:16.114
the whole world will think
we're guilty again.

35:16.148 --> 35:18.417
This could destroy us.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.019
No, it could destroy you.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.559
I'm already gone.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.548
(indistinct chatter)

35:56.988 --> 35:58.257
(indistinct chatter)

36:15.874 --> 36:17.343
(speaking Spanish)

36:20.546 --> 36:23.249
Hey.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.150
Found Rincon.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.718
MADELINE:
Great work. Where?

36:26.752 --> 36:28.420
He's a street preacher
in Hope Park,

36:28.454 --> 36:30.356
preaching that
the world's about to end.

36:30.389 --> 36:31.757
What do you want me to do?

36:31.790 --> 36:33.259
See if he'll
swear out an affidavit

36:33.292 --> 36:35.261
denying the statement
he supposedly gave police.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.695
-Copy that.
-Bodie, be careful.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.431
There's armed drug crews
in that park 24/7.

36:39.465 --> 36:40.932
That's an obstacle.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.269
But I got an idea.
I'll call you back.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.375
Five-O! Five-O!

36:49.408 --> 36:52.278
-WOMAN: Five-O!
-MAN: Five-O! Five-O!

36:52.311 --> 36:54.313
-WOMAN: Five-O!
-(Damian speaking Spanish)

36:58.417 --> 37:00.419
(speaking Spanish)

37:02.988 --> 37:04.956
Damian Rincon.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.061
No speak with no policía.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.210
Aah!

37:25.243 --> 37:27.313
Lucia Rincon was convicted
of arson-homicide

37:27.346 --> 37:30.248
using outdated, outmoded
fire investigation methods.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.651
I remember her trial, Ms. Scott.
I presided over it.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.653
I've also read your brief

37:34.686 --> 37:36.955
detailing this spate
of Christmas tree fires

37:36.988 --> 37:38.990
which all took place
before Mrs. Rincon's trial.

37:39.024 --> 37:41.660
Yes. The fires themselves took
place before the trial, but...

37:41.693 --> 37:43.161
Statute is clear.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.597
Innocence claims must be based
on newly-discovered evidence.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.232
The cause of the fires
wasn't determined

37:47.265 --> 37:48.400
until six years later.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.835
That determination
is our evidence.

37:49.868 --> 37:52.571
Nice try, Ms. Scott, but I'll
stick with my interpretation.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.673
It's not my interpretation.
It's settled precedent.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.742
You say tomato.
I say next issue.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.344
-(gallery murmuring)
-There is no next issue,
Your Honor.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.512
Tomato, Ms. Scott. Next issue.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.180
This is a one-issue case.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.850
If there's no arson,
there's no arson-homicide.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.017
Clock is ticking.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.353
Should we keep
spinning our wheels,

38:07.386 --> 38:09.855
or should we move on
down the road?

38:09.888 --> 38:12.391
(gallery murmuring)

38:15.060 --> 38:17.529
Happy to move on, Your Honor.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.865
Your Honor, if I could
draw the court's attention

38:19.898 --> 38:23.201
to the toxicology report
submitted with our petition.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.703
In violation
of Brady v. Maryland,

38:24.736 --> 38:26.872
Ms. Rincon's blood test was
hidden from defense counsel.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.206
JUDGE SPEER:
Let's discuss how

38:28.239 --> 38:30.141
this blood test
would have impacted the trial.

38:30.175 --> 38:32.478
It clearly undermines Ms.
Rincon's confession, Your Honor.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.946
She has no memory
of the fire or its aftermath.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.049
Among the key symptoms
of carbon monoxide poisoning

38:38.083 --> 38:40.852
is confabulation--
fabrication of imaginary events

38:40.886 --> 38:42.888
to compensate
for total memory loss.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.392
I.e., detectives repeated what
they believed happened over

38:46.425 --> 38:48.560
and over until Ms. Rincon
believed it, too.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.962
I'm not sure that evidence
of carbon monoxide poisoning

38:50.996 --> 38:53.732
is material enough
to change the jury's verdict.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.467
Your Honor, they goaded Lucia

38:55.501 --> 38:57.068
into believing
she murdered her own son.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.905
That, coupled with the guilt
and trauma of losing a child,

38:59.938 --> 39:02.674
amounts to a forced,
unreliable confession.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.843
I'll consider it,
but I'm not gonna lie.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.912
I've heard better.
What else you got?

39:06.945 --> 39:09.080
Wha... What else have we got?

39:09.114 --> 39:11.483
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

39:11.517 --> 39:14.085
Is there something funny about
a woman serving a life sentence

39:14.119 --> 39:15.421
for a crime
that didn't even happen?

39:15.454 --> 39:17.789
-Excuse me?
-(gallery clamoring)

39:20.291 --> 39:22.861
Your Honor, my investigator
has been assaulted.

39:22.894 --> 39:25.030
May we ask
for a recess until tomorrow?

39:25.063 --> 39:27.098
My Lord, you look like hell.

39:27.132 --> 39:29.668
Adjourned until 9:00 a.m.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.537
And, Ms. Scott, I hope

39:31.570 --> 39:33.939
you're a bit cooler
when you come back in this room,

39:33.972 --> 39:36.708
or I will kick you right out.

39:36.742 --> 39:40.211
Are you okay?
What happened to your face?

39:40.245 --> 39:42.514
Rincon's undocumented, he
thought I was from immigration.

39:42.548 --> 39:45.784
After he realized I wasn't ICE,
he finally started talking.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.586
And?

39:47.619 --> 39:49.855
And he didn't write
that statement,

39:49.888 --> 39:51.790
and he never turned
against his wife.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.393
Their entire motive is falsified
on that forged statement.

39:55.427 --> 39:56.695
He's gonna testify?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.630
No, no, no,
because if he shows up to court,

39:58.664 --> 40:01.266
he's gonna be deported,
and he says if he gets deported,

40:01.299 --> 40:02.934
he'll be killed
as soon as he gets home.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.703
I mean, he already disappeared.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.473
We need to prove that
translation was purposely faked.

40:07.506 --> 40:10.341
Yeah. Then let's look
into the translator.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.647
(sighs)

40:22.187 --> 40:24.155
I found something.

40:24.189 --> 40:27.893
That translator did
the same thing in Indiana.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.127
Did you say Indiana?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.496
MADELINE:
Oh, my God.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.330
It's good. Yeah.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.500
If we can get him to testify,
we might have a shot.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.602
As of right now,
it's our only shot.

40:36.635 --> 40:38.737
We got to find this guy.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.739
MADELINE:
Good morning, Your Honor.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.440
Petitioner submits a letter

40:42.474 --> 40:46.177
from the attorney general
of Indiana, detailing

40:46.211 --> 40:48.446
a plea bargain in a case
where the translator,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.281
Thomas LeMay, improperly

40:50.315 --> 40:52.518
translated the testimony
of a critical witness.

40:52.551 --> 40:55.687
Mr. LeMay was also the
translator the prosecution used

40:55.721 --> 40:57.188
in this case.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.157
Your Honor, counsel's claim
is a desperate attempt

40:59.190 --> 41:02.193
to plant the seeds of doubt
into our investigation.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.795
It is a personal vendetta
against myself,

41:03.829 --> 41:07.699
and impossible to prove that
this translation was falsified.

41:07.733 --> 41:09.034
That's because I'm not finished,
Your Honor.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.936
Petitioner calls the translator,

41:10.969 --> 41:12.971
Thomas LeMay, to the stand.

41:13.004 --> 41:16.074
(gallery clamoring)

41:19.010 --> 41:22.714
Petitioner also submits an
affidavit, signed by Mr. LeMay,

41:22.748 --> 41:25.817
admitting to falsifying
the translation in this case,

41:25.851 --> 41:27.719
State of Illinois v. Rincon.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.055
His motivation was
to ensure guilty verdicts

41:30.088 --> 41:31.890
for people
he was convinced were guilty.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.225
LeMAY:
They were guilty, Your Honor.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.794
Get him the hell out
of my courtroom.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.395
-Your Honor,
I want to say something.
-Out.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.898
LeMAY:
Sometimes the ends
justify the means!

41:39.931 --> 41:42.100
Mr. Bellows?

41:44.035 --> 41:46.004
I'm just as shocked
as everyone else in this room.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.239
Oh, that was good.
Very convincing.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.507
-Your Honor.
-No need

41:49.541 --> 41:51.476
-to rub it in, Ms. Scott.
-Even just a little?

41:51.509 --> 41:53.912
How many cases have you tried
using fraudulent translations?

41:53.945 --> 41:55.914
I am under no obligation
to answer questions

41:55.947 --> 41:57.482
posed by opposing counsel.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.484
You are, however, under
obligation to answer questions

41:59.517 --> 42:00.586
from this bench.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.087
You say tomato, I say to-mah-to.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.589
(laughter)

42:03.622 --> 42:07.492
You stole my line, Ms. Scott...

42:07.525 --> 42:08.927
so I'll take yours.

42:10.629 --> 42:14.365
Mr. Bellows,
how many of your prosecutions

42:14.399 --> 42:18.604
relied on this obviously corrupt
translator?

42:20.639 --> 42:22.674
I have no idea, Your Honor,

42:22.708 --> 42:24.676
but I will personally
investigate

42:24.710 --> 42:26.377
each and every one of them.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.780
In fact, I will initiate
an internal review

42:28.814 --> 42:32.183
of all convictions won by my
office over the last 20 years.

42:32.217 --> 42:35.186
If there is even a scintilla
of corruption,

42:35.220 --> 42:36.955
I will root it out.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.857
I've dedicated my life
to serving justice.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.226
Your Honor, the justice
currently before the court

42:41.259 --> 42:44.062
is the false imprisonment
of Lucia Rincon.

42:44.095 --> 42:45.964
We've presented
a forged affidavit,

42:45.997 --> 42:47.633
a hidden toxicology report,

42:47.666 --> 42:51.202
and ample evidence that show
the true cause of the fire.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.304
There was no murder, Your Honor.

42:53.338 --> 42:56.407
Only lies, deceit,
and corruption

42:56.441 --> 43:00.145
that have placed
an innocent woman behind bars.

43:03.514 --> 43:05.483
Mrs. Rincon.

43:05.516 --> 43:07.518
(whispers):
Stand up.

43:08.854 --> 43:11.823
You must feel like
you got lost in the shuffle.

43:11.857 --> 43:14.993
I've gotten used to it,
Your Honor.

43:15.026 --> 43:17.028
Let's see what we can do
about that.

43:18.463 --> 43:21.599
Based on the totality
of the evidence presented,

43:21.633 --> 43:24.069
Petitioner's motion
for post-conviction relief

43:24.102 --> 43:26.504
is granted,
and this court hereby declares

43:26.537 --> 43:29.174
the defendant is...
actually innocent.

43:29.207 --> 43:30.175
(cheering)

43:30.208 --> 43:32.778
Mrs. Rincon, you are free to go.

43:34.545 --> 43:36.547
(applause, whooping)

43:46.291 --> 43:48.026
MAN:
Ms. Scott.

43:48.059 --> 43:51.229
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

43:55.566 --> 43:58.536
(indistinct,
overlapping shouting)

43:58.569 --> 44:00.739
Thank you.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.709
Lucia, how do you feel?

44:03.742 --> 44:06.544
I-I don't mean to sound
ungrateful, but mostly,

44:06.577 --> 44:09.280
I just feel cold.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.382
(overlapping chatter, laughter)

44:15.486 --> 44:16.855
Rosemary?

44:19.925 --> 44:21.893
Rosemary?

44:24.562 --> 44:28.299
Rosemary? Rosemary?

44:28.333 --> 44:31.469
Oh, my God, my God,
please say something.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.471
Levi?

44:33.504 --> 44:35.240
Is she okay?

44:35.273 --> 44:36.842
I don't know, I...

44:36.875 --> 44:38.844
-Oh, my God.
-I'm sorry.

44:38.877 --> 44:41.913
(Madeline screams)

44:41.947 --> 44:43.414
-(both crying)
-* Where you waited *

44:43.448 --> 44:45.183
* In the rain *

44:45.216 --> 44:49.420
* I am siren, I am ivy *

44:49.454 --> 44:52.090
* I am no one *

44:52.123 --> 44:54.092
* I'm nobody *

44:54.125 --> 44:58.596
* I am longing for your honey *

44:58.629 --> 45:04.302
* I am longing for your love. *

45:08.206 --> 45:11.442
* And the shot goes *

45:11.476 --> 45:16.414
* Through my head and back *

45:16.447 --> 45:18.950
* Gunshot *

45:20.485 --> 45:23.554
* Never get you back *

45:23.588 --> 45:28.593
* Never get you
back *

45:28.626 --> 45:33.598
* Never get you back. *

You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.447
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

45:52.150 --> 45:53.952
Welcome to the galaxy.

45:55.153 --> 45:57.122

45:58.957 --> 46:01.827
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

46:01.860 --> 46:03.228
We're gonna make a run for it.

46:03.261 --> 46:04.462

46:04.495 --> 46:08.934
