WEBVTT

02:40.467 --> 02:43.831
- To Joplyn Rose
and guest.

02:43.866 --> 02:45.701
That's my favorite part
by the way.

02:45.736 --> 02:47.439
- Okay.

02:47.474 --> 02:50.970
- And guest. The
estimable Dr. Justus Frost

02:51.005 --> 02:54.545
summons you to join him
at the Staufen House.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.415
I've never been summoned
to therapy before.

02:56.450 --> 02:57.746
- Well, that's
because the Staufen House

02:57.781 --> 02:58.582
isn't just therapy.

02:58.617 --> 02:59.814
It's actually a-

02:59.849 --> 03:00.448
- Exclusive mental
health program

03:00.483 --> 03:02.718
designed to set you free.

03:02.753 --> 03:04.390
Yeah, it says it on the back.

03:04.425 --> 03:06.854
- It's a really big
deal, okay?

03:06.889 --> 03:08.559
All the famouses swear by it.

03:08.594 --> 03:10.264
There's like a two year
waiting list

03:10.299 --> 03:11.430
to even get into this shit.

03:11.465 --> 03:13.300
- Of course, of course.

03:13.335 --> 03:15.731
Hey, I've read about this
Frost guy, by the way.

03:15.766 --> 03:17.304
- Yeah. What'd you read?

03:17.339 --> 03:18.372
- That he's super strange,

03:18.407 --> 03:20.307
that his patients are
sworn to secrecy, that...

03:20.342 --> 03:21.506
- Okay, well,
I can tell you

03:21.541 --> 03:23.475
that he has changed people's
lives, okay?

03:23.510 --> 03:25.004
People that I know.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.414
He's eccentric, but it works.

03:30.517 --> 03:32.715
I'm just saying the coupon
was a much better gift

03:32.750 --> 03:33.782
than you're giving me
credit for.

03:33.817 --> 03:34.882
- And I'm just saying,

03:34.917 --> 03:36.686
it sounds like some white
people shit.

03:36.721 --> 03:38.325
- Well, no argument there.

03:40.791 --> 03:43.759
- Uh-oh. Oh,
hold on now .

03:43.794 --> 03:46.696
- All right, you don't
have to do this every time.

03:46.731 --> 03:47.764
- I'm proud of you.

03:47.799 --> 03:48.431
- You know I've
had my songs on the radio

03:48.466 --> 03:50.568
since I was like 14, right?

03:50.603 --> 03:53.472
- Lyn, look, I'm
excited about the new album.

03:53.507 --> 03:57.003
Babe, these songs, I don't
know, they feel special.

03:57.038 --> 03:58.906
- Yeah, they always do.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.382
- Hey wait,
stop. Pull over.

04:02.417 --> 04:03.779
- What? Why?

04:03.814 --> 04:05.077
- They might need help?

04:05.112 --> 04:06.914
- No, Elijah. Not our help.

04:06.949 --> 04:09.389
- Lyn. Lyn, come on. Lyn.

04:11.492 --> 04:12.788
- Oh my God. Okay.

04:12.823 --> 04:13.789
Okay. Fine.

04:17.597 --> 04:19.498
This doesn't look
ominous at all.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.667
- I'll be right back.

04:33.481 --> 04:33.941
Hello?

04:41.720 --> 04:42.389
Anyone here?

05:11.585 --> 05:12.452
- Oh.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.049
Hey man, you need a hand?

05:18.724 --> 05:20.856
Looks like you're having
a little bit of trouble.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.927
Cool. Cool.

05:25.962 --> 05:29.062
Well, sorry to bother you.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.899
Hey come on-

05:30.934 --> 05:31.669
- Where are you going?

05:35.609 --> 05:36.476
- Is everything okay?

05:41.714 --> 05:42.977
- I'm sorry.

05:43.012 --> 05:43.945
I'm so, so sorry.

05:52.956 --> 05:55.022
- Who the fuck was that guy?

05:55.057 --> 05:57.057
- No fucking clue.

05:57.092 --> 05:58.564
- Come on, let's get outta here.

05:58.599 --> 05:59.466
- Jesus.

06:07.003 --> 06:09.102
Whoa, is that it?

06:09.137 --> 06:10.873
- That's it.

06:10.908 --> 06:13.040
- Damn.
Look at this place.

06:15.077 --> 06:16.846
Ooh. Sexy-ass car too.

06:17.915 --> 06:19.486
- What?

06:19.521 --> 06:20.553
- I offered
to get you

06:20.588 --> 06:21.917
anything you want for Christmas.

06:21.952 --> 06:23.985
"I don't know, just gimme
some coupons or something."

06:24.020 --> 06:25.822
- Well, I wasn't going
to ask you to buy me a car.

06:25.857 --> 06:27.219
- Why not?

06:27.254 --> 06:28.891
- Because I
can buy my own damn car.

06:29.894 --> 06:32.499
...and plus, I love the coupons.

06:34.096 --> 06:34.963
- Okay.

06:37.132 --> 06:37.999
You ready?

06:41.103 --> 06:41.970
- Let's go.

06:43.842 --> 06:44.676
- All right.

07:03.895 --> 07:05.059
- Holy shit. Lyn?

07:06.766 --> 07:08.601
- Joe? No way.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.636
- I haven't seen you since what?
New York?

07:10.671 --> 07:11.835
- Yeah, it was one

07:11.870 --> 07:13.804
of those ridiculous
launch parties of yours.

07:13.839 --> 07:15.201
- It wasn't a launch,
it was an IPO.

07:15.236 --> 07:17.170
- Oh I'm so sorry, an IPO.

07:17.205 --> 07:18.677
- Yeah. I made a lot of money
on that one.

07:18.712 --> 07:19.711
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.746 --> 07:21.240
How are you?

07:21.275 --> 07:23.176
I mean, aside from knocking out
platinum records every year.

07:23.211 --> 07:24.650
- I'm good. Yeah.

07:24.685 --> 07:26.916
Working on the next one
as we speak.

07:26.951 --> 07:28.555
What are you in for?

07:28.590 --> 07:31.085
- Well, I got divorced
again this year.

07:31.120 --> 07:32.559
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:32.594 --> 07:33.186
- Nah, it's fine.

07:33.221 --> 07:34.253
It's the fourth one.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.892
Getting pretty good at
it by now.

07:37.159 --> 07:38.532
Nah, I thought maybe it was time

07:38.567 --> 07:40.259
I did some work on myself, so...

07:40.294 --> 07:41.634
Plus I was summoned.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.834
- Well, can't say no to
that can you?

07:43.869 --> 07:44.901
- Nope.

07:44.936 --> 07:45.605
- What about you?

07:46.872 --> 07:49.675
- Oh, I'm just trying to be
less broken

07:49.710 --> 07:50.940
so I don't lose this one.

07:50.975 --> 07:52.843
- Ah, there's really no
risk of that.

07:52.878 --> 07:54.174
- Hey man, Joe Agrippa.

07:54.209 --> 07:56.682
- Oh shit, yeah.

07:56.717 --> 07:58.717
No, I knew I recognized you.

07:58.752 --> 08:00.719
Lyn just gave me your
book for my birthday.

08:00.754 --> 08:03.590
Wow. You're like real-life
"Iron Man" or something.

08:03.625 --> 08:04.316
- Well...

08:04.351 --> 08:05.757
- I didn't know you knew him.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.825
- Oh yeah. Elijah, I
kind of know Joe Agrippa.

08:07.860 --> 08:09.123
- It's nice to meet
you too, man.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.290
What do you do?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.567
- Oh, nothing fancy.

08:13.602 --> 08:16.295
I'm a mechanic.
I run my granddad's shop.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.330
- He's actually an
amazing musician as well.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.166
- Oh, really?

08:19.201 --> 08:19.969
Anything I've heard?

08:20.004 --> 08:21.971
- No. God, no, no.

08:22.006 --> 08:24.006
I tried for a little bit

08:24.041 --> 08:28.175
and didn't have whatever
it takes I guess...

08:28.210 --> 08:29.814
Which is fine,
I'm happy running the shop.

08:29.849 --> 08:31.211
- Hey, there's nothing wrong

08:31.246 --> 08:33.015
with being a small
business owner.

08:33.050 --> 08:35.589
That's how I started and
now I own three planes.

08:35.624 --> 08:37.151
You never know what can happen.

08:37.186 --> 08:41.056
In fact,
I may have something for you.

08:41.091 --> 08:42.596
Yeah, let's talk later.

08:42.631 --> 08:44.125
- Wow. Really?

08:44.160 --> 08:45.929
I mean, yeah, okay.

08:45.964 --> 08:46.798
I'd love that.

08:46.833 --> 08:47.293
- Good.

08:48.934 --> 08:49.867
How are you Lyn?

08:49.902 --> 08:51.000
- I'm good.

08:51.035 --> 08:52.100
- Did I mention you look great?

08:52.135 --> 08:53.167
- Oh I don't
think you did.

08:53.202 --> 08:54.300
- Well, you really do.

08:54.335 --> 08:55.741
- Do what?

08:55.776 --> 08:56.368
- Look great.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.271
- Why, thank you.

08:58.306 --> 09:00.306
The secret is crushing
self doubt.

09:00.341 --> 09:03.111
- You're a lucky man.

09:03.146 --> 09:04.244
Better lock that up soon.

09:05.885 --> 09:07.951
- Oh, I'm definitely trying.

09:12.925 --> 09:14.859
- Of course, a limo.

09:14.894 --> 09:16.157
- Oh, you're fine.

09:16.192 --> 09:18.665
- Here we are bitches.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.997
The Staufen House. Oh my God.

09:21.032 --> 09:23.736
I have been waiting to be
summoned here

09:23.771 --> 09:25.298
for honestly like forever.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.872
I just can't wait to get like,
grounded

09:27.907 --> 09:29.643
and just like, discover my
inner goddess, you know?

09:29.678 --> 09:30.974
- Whoa, is that Tara Grandier?

09:31.009 --> 09:32.206
- I think it is.

09:32.241 --> 09:33.680
- Oh shit,
it's my therapy buddies.

09:33.715 --> 09:35.847
Hey kids, smile for the camera!

09:38.885 --> 09:41.281
Fuck. Why the fuck are you here?

09:41.316 --> 09:42.656
- To get over the shit you
put me through.

09:42.691 --> 09:43.822
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you back.

09:43.857 --> 09:45.692
- I'd rather deep-throat
a fucking harpoon.

09:45.727 --> 09:46.385
- Have at it.

09:47.894 --> 09:51.797
- Oh shit. Joplyn Rose.

09:51.832 --> 09:54.360
I am such a huge fan of
your music.

09:54.395 --> 09:55.295
- Oh come on, just call me Lyn.

09:55.330 --> 09:56.934
- Ah, girl.

09:56.969 --> 09:58.705
That last single about
being stuck in something

09:58.740 --> 10:00.740
like, I don't know,
like honey or...?

10:00.775 --> 10:03.138
- Yeah it was a murder ballad
about being stuck in honey.

10:03.173 --> 10:03.974
- Yes.

10:04.009 --> 10:05.778
I loved it.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.945
It's like something, something
I'm stuck in honey...

10:07.980 --> 10:09.947
- I literally never say the
word honey.

10:09.982 --> 10:12.213
- I, I'm sorry Miss Grandier.

10:12.248 --> 10:13.918
I don't mean to make this weird,

10:13.953 --> 10:15.788
but like a month,
like a month ago,

10:15.823 --> 10:17.757
a month ago, Lyn showed
me a bunch of your movies.

10:17.792 --> 10:19.088
Wow. Ah man.

10:19.123 --> 10:20.386
I'm sorry. I'm geeking.

10:20.421 --> 10:22.289
I, I just cannot believe
I'm meeting Tara Grandier.

10:22.324 --> 10:23.224
- Sweetie, sweetie.

10:23.259 --> 10:24.291
Don't apologize.

10:24.326 --> 10:26.128
I love meeting my fans.

10:26.163 --> 10:27.800
What was your favorite movie?

10:27.835 --> 10:30.066
- Oh, well I,
I loved "Paganini."

10:30.101 --> 10:33.135
- Oh yeah.
The one where I show my tits.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.301
Real cool dude.

10:34.336 --> 10:35.775
- No, no.

10:35.810 --> 10:37.843
I, I'm, I'm sorry ma'am, miss.

10:37.878 --> 10:41.110
I, I'm not... you're
acting is what I was...

10:41.145 --> 10:42.309
- I'm just fucking with you.

10:42.344 --> 10:43.981
I'm so glad you liked it
.

10:45.215 --> 10:47.413
Where do I know you from?

10:47.448 --> 10:48.821
- You ever get your
brakes checked?

10:48.856 --> 10:50.086
- What do you mean?

10:50.121 --> 10:51.219
Were you in like, a
car movie or something?

10:51.254 --> 10:52.726
- No, I'm a mechanic.

10:52.761 --> 10:54.893
- Oh, can you imagine

10:54.928 --> 10:58.028
- No, that's actually what I do.

10:58.063 --> 10:59.733
- Elijah and I are dating.

10:59.768 --> 11:01.163
- Oh. Oh, okay.

11:01.198 --> 11:01.999
That makes sense.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.495
No, see, I just,

11:03.530 --> 11:05.233
I've been waiting so long
to, you know, come here

11:05.268 --> 11:07.235
and it'd be kind of bullshit
if you, that's all I'm saying.

11:07.270 --> 11:09.039
- Right. No, yeah.

11:09.074 --> 11:10.106
It's all thanks to Lyn.

11:11.340 --> 11:15.309
We are here to work on some
of our stuff.

11:16.477 --> 11:19.753
- He is such a button.
I just love him so much.

11:19.788 --> 11:22.250
- Oh, thank you.

11:22.285 --> 11:23.449
- All right bitches,

11:23.484 --> 11:25.154
let's go change our
motherfucking lives.

11:28.093 --> 11:31.193
I'm not fucking you this time
no matter how much you beg.

11:38.235 --> 11:40.136
- I didn't think wife number
two would be at therapy,

11:40.171 --> 11:41.500
but why not?

11:48.047 --> 11:50.080
- Hey, are you okay?

11:50.115 --> 11:51.510
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:51.545 --> 11:55.888
They're just so famous.

11:55.923 --> 11:57.021
- This's your last chance
to turn around

11:57.056 --> 11:57.890
and go get a burger.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.257
- No, no.

12:02.292 --> 12:03.929
No, it's gonna be awesome.

12:05.130 --> 12:06.866
Let's do it.

12:06.901 --> 12:07.526
- All right.

12:24.919 --> 12:26.347
- Good taste.

12:26.382 --> 12:28.514
- How many times a day do you
jerk off to your own book?

12:28.549 --> 12:30.021
- As many times as I need to.

12:30.056 --> 12:31.286
- Hmm.

12:31.321 --> 12:33.827
- Hey, that book really
helped me actually.

12:33.862 --> 12:35.895
- You see, he's already more
supportive in 10 minutes

12:35.930 --> 12:37.996
than you were in our
entire marriage.

12:38.031 --> 12:40.031
- Oh cool. Maybe you
should cheat on him too.

12:40.066 --> 12:42.297
- Is this gonna be like a whole
weekend thing with you guys?

12:42.332 --> 12:43.199
- Probably.

13:02.055 --> 13:04.220
- Modern art bullshit.

13:04.255 --> 13:05.419
Never really understood it.

13:07.489 --> 13:08.422
What part helped you?

13:09.623 --> 13:10.897
Of the book, I mean.

13:10.932 --> 13:12.591
- Oh, I know it's weird,

13:12.626 --> 13:14.934
but I actually love the
story behind the title,

13:14.969 --> 13:16.364
the guy who tricked the Devil.

13:16.399 --> 13:18.267
- The guy who tricked the Devil?

13:20.535 --> 13:21.501
- I wrote it while we
were together

13:21.536 --> 13:23.503
and she never even read it.

13:23.538 --> 13:26.077
- His name was Wagner, right?

13:26.112 --> 13:28.244
He made a deal with the Devil.

13:28.279 --> 13:30.213
He'd trade his soul in exchange

13:30.248 --> 13:32.545
for having his boots
filled with gold every week

13:32.580 --> 13:34.514
but then he cut the bottoms
off the boots

13:34.549 --> 13:36.956
so they couldn't get full.

13:36.991 --> 13:38.551
The Devil couldn't fulfill
his side of the bargain.

13:38.586 --> 13:40.421
So he couldn't take
Wagner's soul.

13:41.259 --> 13:42.621
- Hmm.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.930
Whoever wrote that is a
terrible writer

13:43.965 --> 13:44.524
and should probably
kill himself.

13:44.559 --> 13:45.492
- I didn't make it up.

13:45.527 --> 13:47.263
It's a legend you idiot.

13:47.298 --> 13:48.968
- Kind of a strange choice.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.630
Writing a self-help book
about Satan.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.500
- Well, people say don't
make a deal with the Devil.

13:53.535 --> 13:55.238
I say, fuck the Devil.

13:55.273 --> 13:58.439
Be smarter than him,
be crueler, be meaner,

13:58.474 --> 14:00.342
make the deal, just win it.

14:01.510 --> 14:02.982
You know what I mean?

14:03.017 --> 14:03.950
- I think so. Yeah.

14:10.156 --> 14:11.485
- So Lyn, didn't you-

14:11.520 --> 14:14.422
- I, I was just gonna say
you guys should get together

14:14.457 --> 14:18.932
at some point this weekend
and chat about business.

14:18.967 --> 14:20.527
Maybe you can get a
car like his after all.

14:27.503 --> 14:29.107
- All right bitches.

14:29.142 --> 14:29.808
If I gotta be stuck with
my ex for three days,

14:29.843 --> 14:31.978
we're gonna motherfucking drink.

14:49.327 --> 14:54.099
- Friends, visitors,
esteemed guests.

15:03.737 --> 15:07.277
- Welcome to the Staufen House.

15:09.248 --> 15:13.580
I am your host and guide Dr.
Justus Frost

15:13.615 --> 15:16.187
and over the next three days,

15:16.222 --> 15:19.421
we will embark upon a
journey that will alter

15:19.456 --> 15:24.096
what is possible for you and
your lives within each of you.

15:24.131 --> 15:28.067
We will create a new realm of
possibility.

15:28.102 --> 15:32.533
One wit, one atom,
one scintilla at a time

15:32.568 --> 15:37.406
until you will finally
discover your true potential.

15:41.445 --> 15:43.181
Please, come, join me.

15:43.216 --> 15:45.150
I will show you to your rooms.

16:06.239 --> 16:09.669
Do not love the world, for
everything in the world,

16:12.245 --> 16:15.708
lust of the flesh,
lust of the eyes,

16:17.151 --> 16:21.516
and the pride of life,
lives not in the father,

16:22.453 --> 16:23.617
but in the world.

16:25.258 --> 16:27.621
That was John, in- 16.

16:28.756 --> 16:30.723
It's rather poorly written
if you ask me.

16:34.234 --> 16:37.136
From birth,
humans are conditioned

16:37.171 --> 16:41.800
to believe that our desires,
our wants, our needs,

16:42.242 --> 16:45.144
our very existence is
somehow corrupt.

16:46.312 --> 16:51.150
We are baptized in shame
and in shame we live.

16:52.285 --> 16:56.386
Cowering from the monsters
of our own desires.

16:56.421 --> 16:59.719
But as we creep cautiously
through our lives,

16:59.754 --> 17:04.394
trying to be good, those
who do not, flourish.

17:06.695 --> 17:09.498
Do not love the world,
the Bible tells us.

17:10.699 --> 17:12.666
To love it is to sin.

17:14.571 --> 17:15.438
To sin.

17:19.675 --> 17:24.513
Is there anything more damaging
than the false idea of sin?

17:29.322 --> 17:32.686
While here you will be
unshackled

17:32.721 --> 17:36.723
from your doubts, your
guilt, your self-loathing.

17:38.463 --> 17:40.793
And you will find out
who it is you truly are.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.335
We have a lot of work to do.

17:45.404 --> 17:46.700
Your room is through there.

17:46.735 --> 17:48.240
Miss Grandier, yours is there,

17:48.275 --> 17:51.705
Mr. Agrippa, Miss Rose,
yours are below.

17:51.740 --> 17:54.246
Please, get comfortable.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.314
I will call when the
festivities begin.

17:56.349 --> 18:00.747
- I, I prefer to stay with
Lyn actually.

18:02.355 --> 18:03.420
- I'm afraid not.

18:04.852 --> 18:07.358
We are doing hard emotional
work, Mr. Moulton.

18:08.526 --> 18:12.297
We must be given time
to process in solitude.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.861
Come, follow me.

18:20.868 --> 18:22.472
- Don't worry, babe.

18:22.507 --> 18:23.671
I'll sneak up in a bit.

18:37.621 --> 18:40.886
Hey, can I ask you a question?

18:43.858 --> 18:45.759
What do you think of my tits?

18:45.794 --> 18:46.661
- I'm sorry?

18:46.696 --> 18:48.465
- In the movie.

18:48.500 --> 18:51.864
- Oh, they were...

18:53.505 --> 18:54.900
very nice.

18:54.935 --> 18:56.242
- But like if you were
to put a number on them.

18:56.277 --> 18:57.342
- A number?
- Yeah.

18:57.377 --> 18:59.377
- A number.
- Yeah.

18:59.412 --> 18:59.938
- A number.

19:02.008 --> 19:05.548
Nine? and half?

19:06.683 --> 19:08.386
Or, I'm sorry.

19:08.421 --> 19:10.883
I'm, I'm a little uncomfortable,
I'm with Lyn, so...

19:10.918 --> 19:12.324
- Oh, I know.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.721
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

19:13.756 --> 19:14.557
I'm so sorry.

19:14.592 --> 19:15.624
- No, it's okay.

19:15.659 --> 19:16.790
Don't worry about it. Yeah.

19:16.825 --> 19:18.561
- Why are you two here
together though?

19:18.596 --> 19:21.894
- We're just, you know,
working on some issues.

19:21.929 --> 19:23.302
Not even issues, really. Just-

19:23.337 --> 19:24.699
- Oh, she wants to fuck
other people.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.899
- No. No, nothing,
nothing like that.

19:26.934 --> 19:31.244
We, I wanna get married,

19:31.279 --> 19:33.378
you know, have a family,
the whole thing

19:33.413 --> 19:36.942
and she's having some
difficulty with that.

19:36.977 --> 19:39.450
- Oh sweetie,
she's a fucking rock star.

19:39.485 --> 19:41.947
- Well, we've been together
for two years.

19:43.588 --> 19:44.488
- Two years?

19:44.523 --> 19:46.325
- Yeah.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.493
- I've never read about you
in the trades or anything.

19:49.528 --> 19:52.628
- Yeah you know, she's
really private about us, so.

19:53.565 --> 19:55.268
- Okay.

19:55.303 --> 19:56.863
Well I guess this weekend
it'll be a good test, huh?

19:56.898 --> 19:58.271
- Yeah, I guess.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.637
Test?

20:01.672 --> 20:05.773
- Oh, I mean, Joe Agrippa,
he's got a bit of a reputation.

20:05.808 --> 20:06.675
I would know.

20:10.010 --> 20:11.581
He's gonna try and fuck her.

20:15.653 --> 20:16.751
Hey, don't worry about it.

20:16.786 --> 20:18.555
If you need anything,

20:18.590 --> 20:19.721
I'm right across the hall.

23:37.987 --> 23:39.118
- You don't understand.

23:40.154 --> 23:41.725
If this doesn't work,
it'll be the end of me.

23:53.068 --> 23:54.001
- Hey.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.168
Hey!

24:00.878 --> 24:01.745
Wait.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.700
- No no no. You've had years.

24:28.741 --> 24:29.707
We had a plan,

24:31.040 --> 24:33.139
We've already he made a
promise to him.

24:33.174 --> 24:35.240
If we fail, we are doomed.

24:35.275 --> 24:36.549
Do you understand?

24:38.080 --> 24:39.783
You will do as we planned.

25:20.386 --> 25:24.960
I do not like little lambs
skipping about my halls,

25:24.995 --> 25:27.028
listening to my secrets.

25:28.163 --> 25:29.932
You're not ready yet.

25:29.967 --> 25:32.869
But you will be brought
to slaughter soon enough.

25:34.169 --> 25:35.608
- Hey, hey, whoa.

25:36.402 --> 25:37.203
- Lyn.

25:37.238 --> 25:38.710
- You okay?

25:38.745 --> 25:40.338
- Yeah. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.746
- Hmm.

25:41.781 --> 25:44.342
I was texting you,
knocking on the door.

25:46.819 --> 25:48.621
Kind of got me worried
about you.

25:48.656 --> 25:51.250
- Sorry. I must have passed out.

25:53.155 --> 25:57.993
- Okay, well, Frost wants
us to meet downstairs.

25:58.963 --> 26:00.259
- It's like- 00 AM.

26:00.294 --> 26:04.736
- Mm-hm. A lovely fireside
chat is what he said.

26:06.234 --> 26:07.838
- All right.

26:07.873 --> 26:09.004
- Yeah?
- See you down there.

26:09.039 --> 26:09.708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:17.916 --> 26:18.882
- You sure you're okay?

26:20.215 --> 26:21.247
- Frost gives me the creeps.

26:23.119 --> 26:26.692
- Listen, if it gets any
weirder, we just dip out.

26:27.728 --> 26:28.386
- Cool.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.159
- Put that on.
- What? What is this?

26:41.137 --> 26:42.774
- Well,
maybe if you followed

26:42.809 --> 26:44.336
the fucking script instead
of fucking improvising you...

26:44.371 --> 26:45.205
- Hey.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.107
- Hey.

26:47.847 --> 26:49.044
- What are you guys
talking about?

26:51.950 --> 26:53.917
- Just some bitches who
cost me an Oscar

26:53.952 --> 26:55.446
because they decided to
go off script

26:55.481 --> 26:56.854
on the day of shooting.

26:56.889 --> 26:59.153
- Did you sleep well Mr.
Moulton?

26:59.188 --> 27:00.352
- Fine, thanks.

27:00.387 --> 27:02.123
- Good. Please sit.

27:02.158 --> 27:04.796
Enjoy the beverage by the fire.

27:15.237 --> 27:17.875
Historically, the night was

27:17.910 --> 27:20.339
a particularly difficult
time for humanity.

27:26.116 --> 27:30.085
It was in the middle of the
night that my mother drowned me.

27:33.057 --> 27:34.254
That's who she was.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.764
Question is, who are you?

27:40.966 --> 27:41.426
- Drowned you?

27:43.034 --> 27:43.901
- Indeed.

27:47.434 --> 27:48.268
- And?

27:49.436 --> 27:51.469
- And now I am no
longer drowned.

27:55.112 --> 27:56.210
The lust of the flesh,

27:57.917 --> 28:01.248
lust of the eyes and the
pride of life.

28:02.988 --> 28:07.452
The three great sins within
which all others reside.

28:07.487 --> 28:10.895
Touch no one, want nothing

28:10.930 --> 28:15.361
and do not under any
circumstances take pride
in yourself.

28:20.467 --> 28:25.008
I would like each of you
to focus on your own sin

28:26.946 --> 28:31.377
and then if you wish,
share it with us.

28:39.222 --> 28:40.419
- Okay. Okay.

28:42.863 --> 28:44.258
I love my shit.

28:44.293 --> 28:48.163
I love my planes, I love
my boats, I love my cars.

28:48.198 --> 28:50.264
I just fucking love being rich.

28:50.299 --> 28:52.200
Probably too much.
- Definitely too much.

28:52.235 --> 28:54.939
- Yes. "The Lust of Eyes".

28:54.974 --> 28:56.974
To enjoy the things you have,

28:57.009 --> 28:59.141
but then to want more.

28:59.176 --> 29:03.541
This we are told is some kind
of cruel immoral failure.

29:08.317 --> 29:12.891
- Oh....

29:14.257 --> 29:17.588
If, If I could,

29:17.623 --> 29:22.131
I would marry cocaine
and Vicodin

29:22.166 --> 29:25.200
and ice cream and
pizza and sushi

29:25.235 --> 29:27.598
and cocaine and, and cocaine.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.270
- You said that one.

29:29.305 --> 29:30.205
- And sex.

29:33.309 --> 29:34.440
I guess that's bad.

29:34.475 --> 29:35.375
- Yes.

29:35.410 --> 29:38.950
Enjoy nothing. Want nothing.

29:38.985 --> 29:41.447
Cage yourself in purity.

29:41.482 --> 29:43.988
"The Lust of The Flesh".

29:44.023 --> 29:45.220
Thank you, Miss Grandier.

29:48.060 --> 29:52.029
Miss Rose,
any sins you wish to discuss?

29:55.496 --> 29:57.397
- I think I'm good.

30:00.369 --> 30:02.105
- Are you sure?

30:02.140 --> 30:02.941
- Mm-hm.

30:02.976 --> 30:04.140
- There's nothing at all?

30:05.308 --> 30:06.175
- No.

30:07.178 --> 30:08.881
- Okay.

30:08.916 --> 30:10.476
- She's not ready yet.

30:10.511 --> 30:11.917
It's perfectly acceptable.

30:13.481 --> 30:14.381
Mr. Moulton?

30:16.352 --> 30:17.450
- I don't know.

30:17.485 --> 30:21.586
I try to live morally, I guess.

30:23.161 --> 30:25.458
- Elijah fancies himself
as somewhat of a hero.

30:25.493 --> 30:26.558
- Not a hero.

30:29.101 --> 30:30.595
- I wonder if Miss Rose,

30:30.630 --> 30:34.533
you would give us the pleasure
of playing one of your songs.

30:34.568 --> 30:37.239
Music is the great lubricant.

30:37.274 --> 30:40.242
It can often take us to places
we refuse to go ourselves.

30:41.542 --> 30:45.511
Perhaps some music will help
you and Mr. Moulton dig deeper.

30:48.417 --> 30:49.988
- Yeah, sure.

30:50.023 --> 30:51.121
- No. Wait, wait.

30:51.156 --> 30:52.452
Didn't you say you were
a musician?

30:52.487 --> 30:53.253
- No. Not really.

30:53.288 --> 30:54.289
- Oh, well I wanna
hear you play.

30:54.324 --> 30:55.455
- No, no.

30:55.490 --> 30:57.061
I think it makes much more sense

30:57.096 --> 30:59.591
to hear Joplyn Rose sing
than the guy dating her.

30:59.626 --> 31:01.065
- Come on Rick, have some balls.

31:01.100 --> 31:01.560
Take a risk.

31:04.103 --> 31:05.531
- His name is Elijah,
you jack-ass.

31:06.699 --> 31:07.940
- Sorry, Elijah.

31:09.405 --> 31:11.339
- "The Pride of Life".

31:11.374 --> 31:14.474
Arrogance, boasting,
showmanship.

31:15.741 --> 31:19.479
Is that the sin you've been
taught to fear most Mr. Moulton?

31:22.616 --> 31:24.385
- A little, I guess.

31:28.028 --> 31:29.291
- Let's do your song.

31:29.326 --> 31:30.457
- No, I don't,
I don't think they wanna-

31:30.492 --> 31:31.491
- Yeah, play.

31:31.526 --> 31:33.361
- Yeah, Come on. Come on.

31:33.396 --> 31:35.000
- Come on dude.
Just play it.

31:38.401 --> 31:40.467
- All right. Woo!

31:40.502 --> 31:41.270
- All right.

31:41.305 --> 31:42.502
Why not?

31:45.045 --> 31:46.143

34:34.445 --> 34:35.510
- Jesus Tara.

34:35.545 --> 34:36.907
- Anybody sounds good

34:36.942 --> 34:38.546
when they get to sing with Lyn.

34:38.581 --> 34:41.384
- You cannot accept that you
are talented, Mr. Moulton.

34:41.419 --> 34:42.616
- Well no, I can, I...

34:42.651 --> 34:43.485
- Just say it.

34:43.520 --> 34:44.783
- Say what?

34:44.818 --> 34:45.586
- Say you're a
good musician.

34:45.621 --> 34:46.422
- I'm a good musician.

34:46.457 --> 34:47.456
- Aw, come on. Mean it.

34:47.491 --> 34:48.292
- I do.

34:48.327 --> 34:48.959
- Really?

34:48.995 --> 34:50.261
- The pride of life.

34:50.296 --> 34:51.427
- Anybody else feeling a
little weird?

34:51.462 --> 34:53.924
- A sin only to those who
wish to fail.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.530
- Okay, fine. It's a good song.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.598
- You can do better
than that, Mr. Moulton.

34:57.633 --> 34:58.830
- It's a really good song?

34:58.865 --> 34:59.864
- Oh, come on, dude.

34:59.899 --> 35:00.498
Own your shit

35:00.533 --> 35:02.306
- Fine. It's a great song.

35:02.341 --> 35:04.374
I wrote a great song.

35:04.409 --> 35:05.837
The best one I've ever written.

35:05.872 --> 35:07.905
It should be on Lyn's
next album.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.676
It's good enough.

35:09.711 --> 35:11.942
Better than some of the
stuff you do now.

35:14.980 --> 35:16.188
- No, go ahead.

35:16.223 --> 35:17.849
- Oh shit, there it is.

35:17.884 --> 35:19.356
- I offered to record
it with you.

35:19.391 --> 35:21.688
- No, Lyn,
you didn't offer as much as say

35:21.723 --> 35:24.922
it was the kind of song
that could be on the album.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.231
- Well, you didn't ask either.

35:26.266 --> 35:27.727
- I didn't want to take
advantage.

35:27.762 --> 35:29.399
- We've been dating for two
years, Elijah,

35:29.434 --> 35:30.829
if you can't talk to me
about this kind of shit,

35:30.864 --> 35:32.303
I don't even know what
the fuck we're doing.

35:32.338 --> 35:33.304
- Oh, so I can ride
your coattails to fame,

35:33.339 --> 35:35.372
but the minute I talk
about marriage, you...

35:35.407 --> 35:37.275
- Oh, you're gonna do that now?

35:37.310 --> 35:38.142
You're gonna do that now?
- Yeah.

35:38.178 --> 35:38.910
- Right now,
that's what you wanna do?

35:38.945 --> 35:39.772
- That's why we're here,
isn't it?

35:41.479 --> 35:42.676
- I don't wanna talk
about our relationship

35:42.711 --> 35:43.809
in front of strangers

35:43.844 --> 35:45.382
at three o'clock in the
fucking morning.

35:45.417 --> 35:47.516
- You don't wanna talk
about our relationship ever.

35:47.551 --> 35:49.782
Not in front of strangers,
not with me.

35:49.817 --> 35:51.850
You're so scared of
accidentally committing to me

35:51.885 --> 35:52.584
that you don't say-
- You know what?

35:52.619 --> 35:54.688
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed.

35:54.723 --> 35:57.427
- No... Come...

35:57.462 --> 35:58.329
Damn it.

36:00.465 --> 36:01.860
Come on Lyn.

36:01.895 --> 36:03.829
- We are here to grow,
Mr. Moulton.

36:05.701 --> 36:07.371
Let her have her time,

36:07.406 --> 36:09.637
without the ever present
specter of you.

36:09.672 --> 36:11.507
- What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

36:11.542 --> 36:14.411
- Hey, I, I'll go talk to her,
all right?

36:17.944 --> 36:18.811
- Good work.

36:25.952 --> 36:30.394
- Well, I guess therapy is over.

36:30.429 --> 36:33.023
- I don't trust that guy.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.267
- Something is off about him.

36:35.302 --> 36:36.961
- Yeah. He's probably a
con artist.

36:36.996 --> 36:37.863
They all are.

36:40.307 --> 36:42.967
Hey, hey.

36:43.002 --> 36:44.243
You don't look too good.

36:45.444 --> 36:46.542
Want to talk upstairs?

36:46.577 --> 36:47.246
- Yes.

36:48.040 --> 36:48.907
- Come on.

37:02.857 --> 37:04.956
- What do you want for
yourself, Elijah?

37:04.991 --> 37:07.365
- God, I feel like I'm the
only one getting therapy here.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.631
- Just making
conversation.

37:09.666 --> 37:11.435
Consider this our business talk.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.306
- I don't know.

37:14.341 --> 37:17.639
I, I do wish I could have
been a musician.

37:17.674 --> 37:19.542
- You know the difference
between you and Lyn?

37:19.577 --> 37:20.543
- Talent.

37:20.578 --> 37:21.874
- Money.

37:21.909 --> 37:24.041
Her whole family's crazy rich.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.846
She could try and fail
for as long as she wants.

37:26.881 --> 37:28.815
She doesn't have to worry
about anything.

37:28.850 --> 37:30.553
Her life will never be
uncomfortable.

37:31.985 --> 37:34.689
I'm guessing you didn't have
that luxury.

37:34.724 --> 37:36.020
I didn't either.

37:36.055 --> 37:37.923
- So how'd you do it?

37:37.958 --> 37:38.924
- I cheated the Devil.

37:38.959 --> 37:40.332
- Huh.

37:40.367 --> 37:43.060
- Elijah,
I got a proposition for you.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.700
I need to put some money
into something, quickly.

37:45.735 --> 37:47.867
And I'll be upfront,
it's not exactly legal,

37:47.902 --> 37:50.903
but hey, anything's legal
if you don't get caught.

37:50.938 --> 37:53.807
- I'm sorry. I, I just
need a, I need a second.

37:53.842 --> 37:55.776
- Let me invest in you.

37:55.811 --> 37:59.351
- Invest in? What do you mean?

37:59.386 --> 38:01.353
- I could buy your little
car business

38:01.388 --> 38:03.718
for two, two and a half million.

38:04.886 --> 38:05.885
- I don't, I don't understand.

38:05.920 --> 38:06.919
Why, why would you do that?

38:06.954 --> 38:08.921
- Because I like you.

38:08.956 --> 38:10.923
I think you're talented.

38:10.958 --> 38:12.925
- I don't know man.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.861
- I saw you looking at my car.

38:14.896 --> 38:15.730
You like it?

38:15.765 --> 38:16.830
You can have it.

38:16.865 --> 38:18.128
Part of the deal.

38:18.163 --> 38:21.098
- I don't want to get
mixed up into anything.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.474
- Okay. Hero complex, I get it.

38:23.509 --> 38:26.675
But just so you know,
no one will know

38:26.710 --> 38:29.007
and it's fucking two and a
half million.

38:31.484 --> 38:32.714
- Can I talk to Lyn first?

38:33.618 --> 38:34.485
- Sure.

38:36.753 --> 38:38.852
Attaboy. Get some rest.

38:38.887 --> 38:40.018
You look like shit.

39:23.701 --> 39:24.634
What part helped you?

40:24.696 --> 40:25.563
- Lyn?

40:46.212 --> 40:49.785
Hey Tara, have you seen Lyn?

40:49.820 --> 40:54.251
- Uh, yes. She and Joe
went to go get alcohol.

40:55.925 --> 40:58.057
- I'm gonna go find them.

40:58.092 --> 41:01.698
- Hey, are you okay?

41:05.803 --> 41:08.133
- No, No.

41:09.202 --> 41:10.839
I'm pretty fucked up actually.

41:10.874 --> 41:13.677
I've been having weird
dreams and last night-

41:13.712 --> 41:15.712
- You passed out, yeah.

41:15.747 --> 41:17.648
Joe and I found you outside.

41:17.683 --> 41:19.210
- I don't know what the
hell that was.

41:20.818 --> 41:24.281
- When Joe was cheating
on me, I was a total mess.

41:24.316 --> 41:25.788
It's amazing what anxiety
can do to you.

41:25.823 --> 41:27.526
- Lyn is not cheating on me.

41:30.927 --> 41:32.157
- No, I know.

41:32.192 --> 41:34.027
I'm just saying that,
that if you need to talk.

41:35.294 --> 41:37.602
- Thanks I, thank you.

41:39.133 --> 41:40.297
Did she say when they would be-

41:45.876 --> 41:46.974
when they uh...

41:48.010 --> 41:49.647
Where's Frost?

41:49.682 --> 41:52.243
- Exploring the three great sins

41:52.278 --> 41:54.311
wherein all other sins reside.

41:56.788 --> 41:59.250
Hey, since everyone's gone,
you wanna hang out with me?

42:06.358 --> 42:07.258
- No, thanks.

42:35.321 --> 42:36.188
- Hey!

42:38.764 --> 42:39.224
Hey! Wait!

42:42.867 --> 42:43.734
Hey!

42:47.806 --> 42:48.233
Wait!

42:49.940 --> 42:51.203
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:55.044 --> 42:56.648
- You can't stop it.

42:56.683 --> 42:57.979
You can't stop it.

43:01.248 --> 43:02.115
- Wait.

43:49.494 --> 43:51.065
- What are you doing out here?

43:52.805 --> 43:53.265
- Just a,

43:58.877 --> 43:59.337
nature walk.

44:01.275 --> 44:02.373
- Is everything okay?

44:03.849 --> 44:08.115
- I uh, wish you would've
told me you left.

44:10.383 --> 44:12.988
- Well, you kind of disappeared.

44:13.023 --> 44:13.890
Thought you didn't wanna see me.

44:13.925 --> 44:15.221
- Of course I wanna see you.

44:15.256 --> 44:16.794
Yeah. I'm sorry about earlier-

44:16.829 --> 44:18.323
- Hey, fun drive right?

44:19.260 --> 44:20.127
- Oh.

44:24.001 --> 44:26.331
Yeah, yeah. It was,
it was great.

44:27.532 --> 44:28.333
Thanks again.

44:28.368 --> 44:29.235
- No problem.

44:30.942 --> 44:32.975
- Hey, feeling better man?

44:33.010 --> 44:33.844
- Not really.

44:33.879 --> 44:34.944
- Ah, that's too bad.

44:34.979 --> 44:38.376
Oh hey,
I told Lyn about the deal.

44:38.411 --> 44:39.278
She's excited.

44:41.216 --> 44:44.250
- Actually, I don't think I
was thinking clearly earlier.

44:44.285 --> 44:45.988
- Oh yeah?

44:46.023 --> 44:46.483
- Yeah.

44:48.091 --> 44:51.290
- Hey, hey, second thoughts
are totally natural.

44:51.325 --> 44:53.963
But you should know I already
have someone else interested.

44:53.998 --> 44:55.426
- Really?

44:55.461 --> 44:56.867
- Yeah. Just called
him a little while ago.

44:56.902 --> 44:58.066
So if you're sure you
don't want it,

44:58.101 --> 44:59.837
I'm gonna go ahead and call-

44:59.872 --> 45:01.773
- I really appreciate the offer,
I just...

45:01.808 --> 45:04.402
- Okay, okay. No pressure.

45:04.437 --> 45:06.305
I just wanted to help.

45:07.979 --> 45:09.407
You wanna beer?

45:09.442 --> 45:12.212
- Hmm, maybe later.

45:14.150 --> 45:15.050
I'm gonna go nap.

45:16.581 --> 45:20.220
I'll uh, I'll see you in a bit?

45:20.255 --> 45:21.221
- Yeah, yeah.

45:21.256 --> 45:22.860
In a second.

45:22.895 --> 45:23.795
- Cool.

45:47.546 --> 45:49.887
- Enjoying your stay so far,
Mr. Moulton?

45:52.892 --> 45:55.156
- I don't think we're
gonna stay, actually.

45:55.191 --> 45:59.127
- No? Not your cup of tea?

46:00.394 --> 46:03.362
This is life, Mr. Moulton.

46:03.397 --> 46:08.235
You either seize your chances
or you linger in mediocrity.

46:11.603 --> 46:14.109
You've the world at your
fingertips.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.626
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

46:36.661 --> 46:38.265
But I can't right now.

46:39.235 --> 46:40.201
- Hey, wait.

46:41.941 --> 46:45.107
Hey wait. Hey, wait, Joe.

46:45.142 --> 46:45.607
- What up?

46:47.342 --> 46:48.374
- I changed my mind.

46:52.083 --> 46:53.885
- This is not a good way to
start a business relationship.

46:53.920 --> 46:57.053
- Yeah, I'm sorry,
but I wanna do it.

46:57.088 --> 46:59.253
I want to. Please.

47:21.948 --> 47:22.639
- Welcome aboard.

47:23.708 --> 47:25.345
You just gotta whole lot richer.

47:31.122 --> 47:34.486
- Hey, did you also mention
something about the car?

47:36.523 --> 47:37.522
- You're right, I did.

48:12.196 --> 48:13.294
- This has been

48:16.101 --> 48:18.167
such a crazy day.

48:25.209 --> 48:29.079
- I'm sorry if I've been
acting kind of weird.

48:29.114 --> 48:33.985
Just, I feel like I've been
losing my mind

48:34.020 --> 48:35.349
in the last few hours.

48:39.025 --> 48:41.157
- You know,
she's fucking him, right?

48:41.192 --> 48:42.125
- What the hell?

48:43.293 --> 48:44.358
What are you doing here?

48:44.393 --> 48:46.723
- Did he offer you something?

48:46.758 --> 48:51.266
Like a, I don't know, like
a deal or money or...?

48:51.301 --> 48:54.104
Yeah. Yep.

48:54.139 --> 48:56.106
That's what he does to
people he screws over

48:56.141 --> 48:57.404
to make himself feel better.

48:57.439 --> 48:58.537
- You're lying.

48:59.540 --> 49:00.572
- I really wish I was.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.378
I really wish this was
some kind of weird joke,

49:04.413 --> 49:06.611
but I got video.

49:16.524 --> 49:17.754
- No, no, I can't.

49:17.789 --> 49:19.492
I don't, I don't...

49:23.333 --> 49:24.431
- I'm sorry, Elijah.

49:24.466 --> 49:25.696
- Tara, please.

49:25.731 --> 49:29.568
- Hey. I know.

49:29.603 --> 49:31.174
I know what it's like, okay?

49:31.209 --> 49:32.109
I've been there.

49:33.475 --> 49:34.342
I'm sorry.

49:37.413 --> 49:38.115
I'm really sorry.

49:42.484 --> 49:43.351
- Please.

49:44.618 --> 49:45.419
I can't.

49:45.454 --> 49:46.220
- Hey, hey.

49:47.819 --> 49:50.127
You deserve happiness too,
you know?

49:57.763 --> 49:58.828
- No, no. Wait.

49:58.863 --> 50:01.138
- Shh. It'll be our secret.

50:02.174 --> 50:02.634
Yeah?

52:17.375 --> 52:18.341
- Help me.

52:31.455 --> 52:31.915
- Shit.

53:11.627 --> 53:16.663
- Here we are bitches.

53:55.539 --> 53:58.969

53:59.004 --> 54:00.509
Oh, my God, I've been waiting

54:00.544 --> 54:01.873
to be summoned here for

54:01.908 --> 54:04.348
I have been waiting to

Oh Shit,

Ooh, it's my therapy buddies.

54:10.587 --> 54:12.620
Hey kids, smile for the camera.

54:13.821 --> 54:14.952
- Can we not film? Sorry.

54:14.987 --> 54:17.460
- Oh,
but we're making memories.

54:17.495 --> 54:18.087
- Okay.

54:26.669 --> 54:27.800
- You can't stop it.

54:27.835 --> 54:29.373
You can't stop it.

54:37.680 --> 54:38.145
- Good morning.

54:39.550 --> 54:40.582
- Put the axe down.

54:40.617 --> 54:42.012
- Oh sweetie, I can't.

54:42.047 --> 54:45.488
See I need it in case you,
do that.

54:48.856 --> 54:50.757
- Elijah!

54:50.792 --> 54:52.924
You know Frost is never
gonna let you leave .

54:54.598 --> 54:55.894
- Lyn. Lyn.

55:00.098 --> 55:01.636
What?

55:01.671 --> 55:02.670
Lyn.

55:02.705 --> 55:04.474
- Elijah, there you are.

55:04.509 --> 55:05.772
I've been looking all over
for you, man.

55:05.807 --> 55:07.939
I thought we should have
a talk about our future.

55:07.974 --> 55:09.380
Don't you think?

55:09.415 --> 55:10.073
I do.

55:13.419 --> 55:14.715
- Ready for round
two ?

55:40.512 --> 55:44.173
- How good are
you really Mr. Moulton?

55:49.719 --> 55:52.016
- The three great sins

55:52.051 --> 55:56.790
committed in less than two
days .

55:59.630 --> 56:02.026
I fear I cannot let you escape.

56:03.469 --> 56:05.029
Our master needs you.

56:05.900 --> 56:07.064
We need you.

56:49.174 --> 56:51.075
- I haven't been
completely honest with you.

56:51.110 --> 56:53.979
- Lyn, Lyn, what are you...?

57:00.152 --> 57:02.493
- Please put the knife down.

57:03.826 --> 57:08.059
- When my grandmother was
young, she lost her parents.

57:08.094 --> 57:11.733
Alone, poor, nowhere to go.

57:12.934 --> 57:13.768
She made a deal.

57:16.036 --> 57:17.475
She sold her soul.

57:19.677 --> 57:21.039
Tara's great-granddad
did the same.

57:21.910 --> 57:22.576
And Joe?

57:23.780 --> 57:25.109
Well Joe is just a greedy fuck.

57:25.144 --> 57:26.616
He sold his own soul

57:26.651 --> 57:29.718
at a tech convention in '08,
actually.

57:29.753 --> 57:33.689
And with it comes fame,
success, the works.

57:35.594 --> 57:37.990
But when you make a deal
with the Devil, Elijah,

57:38.025 --> 57:41.664
there are stipulations.

57:43.129 --> 57:43.996
- The Devil?

57:46.033 --> 57:49.804
- Every year on a certain
day, by a certain time,

57:50.939 --> 57:54.270
you are summoned to
renew the deal.

57:57.308 --> 57:58.549
A sacrifice.

58:00.080 --> 58:03.950
Someone pure of heart.

58:05.250 --> 58:06.623
And if you fail,

58:08.759 --> 58:12.794
or if you refuse then you're
sent to hell

58:12.829 --> 58:15.291
and the contract falls
to your next of kin.

58:16.228 --> 58:17.260
- No.

58:17.295 --> 58:18.734
No, no, no.

58:18.769 --> 58:20.296
Hey. Come, come on Lyn.

58:21.871 --> 58:22.738
- Just...

58:25.908 --> 58:27.270
I can't put that on my babies.

58:30.715 --> 58:32.814
- No. Hey, hey.

58:33.850 --> 58:34.783
Look at me.

58:36.688 --> 58:37.786
Is this what Frost is
telling you?

58:37.821 --> 58:40.019
- Frost doesn't make the rules.

58:42.122 --> 58:43.561
- Who are you here to sacrifice?

58:48.326 --> 58:50.601
- I was ready to let
this end with me, Elijah.

58:52.231 --> 58:53.637
I was. I just...

58:56.708 --> 58:58.070
I don't wanna go to hell.

58:58.105 --> 58:59.137
I'm sorry.

59:00.074 --> 59:01.777
- Time to go.

59:01.812 --> 59:02.844
- No wait.

59:05.717 --> 59:07.783
- I thought you
were working this guy.

59:07.818 --> 59:09.213
Why did it take so long?

59:09.248 --> 59:10.918
- Did you seriously
fall in love with the lamb?

59:10.953 --> 59:12.150
You dumb slut.

59:12.185 --> 59:14.053
Oh my God, these boots.

59:14.088 --> 59:15.725
- Every year is
the same thing with you.

59:15.760 --> 59:16.990
Buy some fucking running shoes.

59:17.025 --> 59:17.925
- Fuck you.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.025
I like to dress up for things.

59:19.060 --> 59:20.125
- Can you guys give it a
fucking rest?

59:20.160 --> 59:21.731
- Shut up bitch,

59:21.766 --> 59:22.598
you totally dropped the
ball this year.

59:22.634 --> 59:25.768
- Lyn. Please,
please don't do this.

59:25.803 --> 59:27.099
- It's part of the gig, man.

59:27.134 --> 59:28.034
It's you or us.

59:28.069 --> 59:29.266
- You do this every year?

59:29.301 --> 59:30.740
- Yeah. And it's a whole thing.

59:30.775 --> 59:31.774
First we gotta find
someone innocent,

59:31.809 --> 59:32.907
get them to do the sins,

59:32.942 --> 59:34.271
lug their asses to the
fucking woods

59:34.306 --> 59:35.206
and then sacrifice them.

59:35.241 --> 59:37.076
I mean, it's like exhausting.

59:37.111 --> 59:38.649
- How many people have
you killed?

59:40.147 --> 59:41.410
- You're the 17th.

59:41.445 --> 59:44.050
- You're murderers. Let me go.

59:44.085 --> 59:45.821
Let me go.

59:45.856 --> 59:47.955
- Relax, relax.

59:47.990 --> 59:48.956
Think of it this way.

59:48.991 --> 59:50.793
Your dying saves three people.

59:50.828 --> 59:51.420
It's simple math.

59:51.455 --> 59:52.121
- That's true.

59:52.156 --> 59:53.356
As long as we all draw blood,

59:53.391 --> 59:54.423
one death counts for all of us.

59:54.458 --> 59:56.062
Cool, right?

59:56.097 --> 59:57.129
- You don't have to do this.

59:57.164 --> 59:57.863
You don't have to...

59:57.898 --> 1:00:00.935
Lyn, Lyn, Lyn, I bought a ring.

1:00:00.970 --> 1:00:02.233
- Give it a rest, man.

1:00:02.268 --> 1:00:03.366
- I was gonna ask you
to marry me after this.

1:00:03.401 --> 1:00:04.906
- Fuck, my fucking boots.

1:00:04.941 --> 1:00:06.941
- Please, let me go.

1:00:06.976 --> 1:00:07.777
- What the fuck?

1:00:07.812 --> 1:00:10.241
Ah! Fuck.

1:00:10.276 --> 1:00:12.848
In the arm pit, really?

1:00:14.379 --> 1:00:15.752
- Lyn?

1:00:15.787 --> 1:00:16.984
- Lyn,
what the fuck are you doing?

1:00:17.019 --> 1:00:18.084
Ah. You fuck.

1:00:18.119 --> 1:00:19.888
- Run Elijah, run.

1:00:22.090 --> 1:00:23.826
- Lyn!

1:00:23.861 --> 1:00:26.158
You're gonna get us
fucking killed.

1:00:26.193 --> 1:00:27.192
Fuck.
- Fuck.

1:00:27.227 --> 1:00:28.226
- Fuck
- That fucking hurt,

1:00:28.261 --> 1:00:29.766
you little fucking cunt.

1:00:29.801 --> 1:00:30.261
- Fucking hell.

1:00:32.034 --> 1:00:34.067
- Get up.

1:01:03.802 --> 1:01:05.230
- Damn!

1:01:12.503 --> 1:01:13.876
- If you die, you go to hell?

1:01:13.911 --> 1:01:15.240
- That is none of your
concern right now.

1:01:15.275 --> 1:01:16.406
- Of course it is.

1:01:19.884 --> 1:01:20.476
I can't lose you.

1:01:23.481 --> 1:01:24.348
- Okay.

1:01:26.286 --> 1:01:28.286
You bragged at the fire,
that's pride of life.

1:01:28.321 --> 1:01:29.419
You took Joe's deal?

1:01:29.454 --> 1:01:30.453
- Yeah.
- Lust of eyes.

1:01:30.488 --> 1:01:31.322
And you fucked Tara?

1:01:33.260 --> 1:01:35.227
It's fine.
We're very good at what we do.

1:01:35.262 --> 1:01:37.834
Look, you committed the
three sins.

1:01:37.869 --> 1:01:41.266
Now we have to sacrifice you
on the altar by midnight. Okay?

1:01:41.301 --> 1:01:43.367
So you run and you hide.

1:01:43.402 --> 1:01:44.874
You just have to wait them out.

1:01:44.909 --> 1:01:46.975
- There's gotta be a
way out of this for you.

1:01:48.946 --> 1:01:49.406
- There is.

1:01:53.445 --> 1:01:54.246
- Lyn!

1:01:55.117 --> 1:01:57.788
No!

1:02:22.177 --> 1:02:23.341
- Wanna make out?

1:02:27.050 --> 1:02:31.888
- Elijah?

1:02:33.155 --> 1:02:33.824
Elijah?

1:02:43.594 --> 1:02:44.835
- Hey Elijah.

1:02:46.201 --> 1:02:49.433
Fuck, marry, kill the
people you met this weekend.

1:02:53.142 --> 1:02:57.342
Me personally, I've always
wanted to fuck Frost.

1:02:57.377 --> 1:03:01.412
We are baptized in shame
and in shame we live,

1:03:01.447 --> 1:03:04.822
I mean, tie me up and put
that cane to use daddy.

1:03:06.155 --> 1:03:07.451
Oh shit.

1:03:07.486 --> 1:03:09.288
You know what I just realized?

1:03:09.323 --> 1:03:11.224
I fucked you.

1:03:11.259 --> 1:03:15.162
I married Joe and I killed Lyn.

1:03:16.429 --> 1:03:18.066
I did it! .

1:03:18.101 --> 1:03:19.166
I completed the game.

1:03:19.201 --> 1:03:20.937
How many people can actually
say that?

1:03:22.402 --> 1:03:24.006
That's actually pretty cool.

1:03:27.341 --> 1:03:28.505
- Elijah!

1:04:08.349 --> 1:04:09.447
- Come with me.

1:04:29.337 --> 1:04:30.138
- What the hell?

1:04:30.173 --> 1:04:31.040
Why are we back here?

1:04:31.075 --> 1:04:31.667
- Shut the fuck up.

1:04:33.374 --> 1:04:34.043
- Who are you?

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:36.606
- I was you once.

1:04:37.675 --> 1:04:39.279
A lamb.

1:04:39.314 --> 1:04:40.247
- You escaped?

1:04:40.282 --> 1:04:42.678
- No, no, no, no. Lyn let me go.

1:04:45.650 --> 1:04:46.715
- And why are you still here?

1:04:46.750 --> 1:04:48.090
- He won't let me leave.

1:04:52.327 --> 1:04:55.361
He makes me take the bodies
after they're done with them.

1:04:57.035 --> 1:04:58.694
I mark their passing.

1:05:00.731 --> 1:05:02.137
- How long have you been here?

1:05:02.172 --> 1:05:03.270
- Nine years. Nine years.

1:05:06.209 --> 1:05:07.076
- We have to stop them.

1:05:07.111 --> 1:05:07.571
- Yes, exactly.

1:05:09.542 --> 1:05:11.641
When Lyn let me go, she
let me go too early.

1:05:11.676 --> 1:05:14.479
They found someone else and
completed the sacrifice.

1:05:14.514 --> 1:05:15.986
Not this time.

1:05:16.021 --> 1:05:17.548
This time you wait,

1:05:17.583 --> 1:05:19.715
you stall them until
the last possible moment

1:05:21.158 --> 1:05:22.520
and then you shoot yourself.

1:05:23.721 --> 1:05:25.358
You send them to hell.

1:05:26.295 --> 1:05:27.657
- What?

1:05:27.692 --> 1:05:29.461
That's your plan?
For me to kill myself?

1:05:29.496 --> 1:05:31.133
- It's the only fucking way.

1:05:31.168 --> 1:05:32.497
- Just fucking, just, just,
just, get away from me man.

1:05:32.532 --> 1:05:33.630
- Elijah!?

1:05:33.665 --> 1:05:35.302
- Oh, fuck.

1:05:35.337 --> 1:05:37.337
- I'm gonna chop an
itty-bitty piece of you

1:05:37.372 --> 1:05:40.373
for every minute of my life
your wasting.

1:05:52.123 --> 1:05:53.089
- Oh shi...

1:07:28.813 --> 1:07:30.318
What?

1:07:30.353 --> 1:07:34.685
- Oh,
little lamb.

1:07:36.227 --> 1:07:37.193
I can't let you leave.

1:07:38.592 --> 1:07:39.789
Not like this.

1:07:41.364 --> 1:07:43.760
Not until you've heard
our offer.

1:07:45.401 --> 1:07:46.796
- Please.

1:07:46.831 --> 1:07:47.863
Please, don't do this.
- Shut the fuck up.

1:07:47.898 --> 1:07:48.564
- I give to you this
lamb of God.

1:07:48.599 --> 1:07:49.865
- Please, please. I have kids.

1:07:52.177 --> 1:07:53.341
Please don't do this.

1:07:53.376 --> 1:07:55.145
- Lyn!
- Just fucking do it.

1:07:55.180 --> 1:07:55.838
- Please.

1:07:56.775 --> 1:07:57.576
- What the fuck?

1:07:57.611 --> 1:07:59.215
- You let him go?

1:07:59.250 --> 1:08:00.414
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1:08:04.849 --> 1:08:08.587
- You can save Lyn from this
life of murder, Mr. Moulton.

1:08:08.622 --> 1:08:10.193
- Lyn's dead.

1:08:10.228 --> 1:08:12.195
- Not yet.
There's still time.

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:15.858
- How?

1:08:17.565 --> 1:08:20.302
- Your soul.
Give him what he wants.

1:08:21.404 --> 1:08:21.864
Take her place.

1:08:23.241 --> 1:08:23.833
We need your soul.

1:08:31.612 --> 1:08:32.479
- Lyn?

1:08:42.689 --> 1:08:44.161
- I can't keep doing
this Frost.

1:08:46.264 --> 1:08:48.528
I can't keep killing people
every year.

1:08:48.563 --> 1:08:49.892
It's worse every year.

1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:56.338
- I'm afraid
you don't have a choice.

1:08:56.373 --> 1:08:59.638
It's the deal your
grandmother made.

1:08:59.673 --> 1:09:01.244
- There's gotta be
a way out.

1:09:02.511 --> 1:09:05.413
- There is, Wagner.

1:09:08.011 --> 1:09:09.615
- The man who tricked
the Devil?

1:09:09.650 --> 1:09:10.748
That's real?

1:09:10.783 --> 1:09:12.321
- Yes, it's real.

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:14.455
Wagner Moulton has a descendant.

1:09:15.788 --> 1:09:18.789
A young man whose soul the
Devil would give anything for.

1:09:19.891 --> 1:09:21.594
- Including our freedom?

1:09:21.629 --> 1:09:22.496
- Yes.

1:09:23.664 --> 1:09:26.929
You have to find him,
bring him here.

1:09:26.964 --> 1:09:29.437
Convince him to make the deal.

1:09:29.472 --> 1:09:30.438
- What's his name?

1:09:30.473 --> 1:09:31.406
- You should know.

1:09:32.409 --> 1:09:36.840
If we fail, our master
will not be forgiving.

1:09:38.778 --> 1:09:41.977
- What is his name, Frost?

1:09:53.595 --> 1:09:55.364
- Loves Lyn,
hero complex.

1:09:58.930 --> 1:10:00.930
- Well, here we are again.

1:10:05.871 --> 1:10:08.542
Oh, we can only die if we
don't renew the contract,

1:10:08.577 --> 1:10:11.006
otherwise it just really hurts.

1:10:13.714 --> 1:10:17.287
Frost used to be human, you
know, hundreds of years ago,

1:10:17.322 --> 1:10:20.587
but he and a friend summoned
up the Devil

1:10:20.622 --> 1:10:23.953
and that friend was Wagner,

1:10:23.988 --> 1:10:26.021
who tricked the Devil.

1:10:26.056 --> 1:10:29.530
Got those shiny boots of gold,
he got away with his soul.

1:10:29.565 --> 1:10:32.434
And in punishment, Frost
has been trapped here

1:10:32.469 --> 1:10:33.567
paying for it ever since.

1:10:34.636 --> 1:10:37.538
You are the direct
descendant of Wagner Moulton,

1:10:38.871 --> 1:10:40.002
eight generations removed.

1:10:43.678 --> 1:10:46.415
- He's been after the soul
of Wagner Moulton descendants

1:10:46.450 --> 1:10:47.647
ever since he was tricked.

1:10:48.815 --> 1:10:51.013
He'd do anything for it,

1:10:51.048 --> 1:10:54.720
including give me and
Miss Rose our souls back.

1:10:54.755 --> 1:10:56.854
Sign the contract

1:10:56.889 --> 1:11:00.363
and your beloved Lyn is
freed from this burden.

1:11:00.398 --> 1:11:01.925
- You didn't bring me here
to kill me.

1:11:03.797 --> 1:11:06.633
You brought me here to
trade my soul for yours.

1:11:06.668 --> 1:11:07.865
- I'm so sorry, Elijah.

1:11:08.967 --> 1:11:11.572
For two years, I worked you.

1:11:11.607 --> 1:11:13.640
Two years to make sure that
you fell in love with me

1:11:13.675 --> 1:11:14.806
and then I fell in
love with you.

1:11:14.841 --> 1:11:16.478
How fucked up is that?

1:11:19.582 --> 1:11:20.779
I just thought if you
saw what you could have-

1:11:20.814 --> 1:11:21.945
- How could you do this to me?

1:11:24.015 --> 1:11:26.455
- I didn't know what else to do.

1:11:26.490 --> 1:11:28.721
I just thought there was
a way out of this for me.

1:11:28.756 --> 1:11:32.626
But I realize now that this
is exactly what I deserve.

1:11:32.661 --> 1:11:34.529
I'm so sorry, Elijah.

1:11:34.564 --> 1:11:36.597
You have to get out of here.

1:11:36.632 --> 1:11:37.298
You have to get out of here.

1:11:37.333 --> 1:11:38.962
- You goddamn, motherfucking,

1:11:38.997 --> 1:11:41.602
bitch-ass traitor motherfuckers.

1:11:41.637 --> 1:11:42.801
We were a team!

1:11:42.836 --> 1:11:44.968
- You didn't even think of
cutting us in.

1:11:45.003 --> 1:11:46.904
- If he signs the contract
and you and Frost go free,

1:11:46.939 --> 1:11:47.938
we don't have a lamb.

1:11:47.973 --> 1:11:48.605
You're fucking killing us.

1:11:48.641 --> 1:11:50.072
- I thought we were friends.

1:11:51.713 --> 1:11:54.384
- Friends? This?

1:11:55.453 --> 1:11:57.046
You're monsters.

1:11:57.081 --> 1:11:58.454
You don't deserve to be free.

1:11:58.489 --> 1:11:59.752
- That's it.

1:11:59.787 --> 1:12:02.018
We're sacrificing this
motherfucker right now.

1:12:02.053 --> 1:12:03.591
We can talk about our
relationships later, okay?

1:12:03.626 --> 1:12:04.790
- Either one of you two
would've done

1:12:04.825 --> 1:12:06.022
the same fucking thing.
- Hey!

1:12:06.057 --> 1:12:06.858
- You shut the fuck up.

1:12:06.893 --> 1:12:08.057
- I don't-
- Hey!

1:12:12.734 --> 1:12:13.997
- You come any fucking closer

1:12:15.704 --> 1:12:17.671
and I'm gonna fucking
shoot myself in the head.

1:12:19.477 --> 1:12:20.575
- Just, wait.

1:12:20.610 --> 1:12:21.939
- It's an hour until midnight.

1:12:23.175 --> 1:12:26.779
Ain't no way you're finding
another sacrifice before then.

1:12:26.814 --> 1:12:30.750
I die, you die.

1:12:30.785 --> 1:12:31.520
- Elijah, come on.

1:12:36.153 --> 1:12:38.087
- Relax.
- Okay, it's okay.

1:12:40.861 --> 1:12:42.157
Okay. Okay.

1:12:42.192 --> 1:12:43.026
- Easy.

1:12:47.538 --> 1:12:49.032
Put it, put it down.

1:13:02.179 --> 1:13:07.182
- Elijah! Get back here.

1:13:21.572 --> 1:13:23.803
- I don't want this
anymore. Please.

1:13:23.838 --> 1:13:25.805
Don't make me do this.

1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:27.609
Just let me go.

1:13:27.644 --> 1:13:29.237
- The way I see it,
Mr. Moulton,

1:13:29.272 --> 1:13:31.239
you have two choices.

1:13:31.274 --> 1:13:33.648
You can save the love
of your life

1:13:33.683 --> 1:13:35.683
or you can run like a coward
- Shut up!

1:13:35.718 --> 1:13:37.553
- And let an
innocent man die for you.

1:13:37.588 --> 1:13:40.050
Take her place, Elijah.

1:13:40.085 --> 1:13:42.085
You want to be a hero?

1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:43.724
Here's your chance.

1:13:43.759 --> 1:13:44.857
- Shut up! Shut up!

1:13:44.892 --> 1:13:47.123
I don't care!
I don't fucking care!

1:15:01.034 --> 1:15:02.572
- Shut the fuck up.

1:15:02.607 --> 1:15:03.771
- Why is this taking so
fucking long?

1:15:03.806 --> 1:15:05.069
You do this every fucking year.

1:15:05.104 --> 1:15:05.905
- You wanna do this?

1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:06.807
- Let them go.

1:15:11.011 --> 1:15:12.340
- You remember,
we can't die right?

1:15:12.375 --> 1:15:14.683
- You could die for a
little bit.

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:15.178
That's enough.

1:15:16.951 --> 1:15:17.752
- Ow!

1:15:17.787 --> 1:15:18.247
- Fuck

1:15:19.690 --> 1:15:21.184
- What are you doing here?

1:15:21.219 --> 1:15:22.251
- Untie him.

1:15:22.286 --> 1:15:23.692
- What?

1:15:23.727 --> 1:15:24.594
- Untie him.

1:15:26.125 --> 1:15:27.630
- Are you fucking serious?

1:15:27.665 --> 1:15:28.092
I just spent 30 minutes
doing that shit.

1:15:28.127 --> 1:15:29.731
- Untie him!

1:15:31.801 --> 1:15:33.262
- What the fuck?

1:15:41.778 --> 1:15:44.614
- Okay. Now go home.

1:15:44.649 --> 1:15:46.077
- No, I'm signing the contract.

1:15:46.112 --> 1:15:47.177
- No.
- Yes.

1:15:48.147 --> 1:15:49.751
I'm not losing you, Lyn.

1:15:51.018 --> 1:15:53.249
If this is the only way we
can be together, then fine.

1:15:54.351 --> 1:15:55.152
I love you.

1:15:55.187 --> 1:15:56.219
- Elijah, please.

1:15:56.254 --> 1:15:57.891
- You're not changing my mind.

1:15:57.926 --> 1:16:01.356
- I hear we have a deal.

1:16:05.362 --> 1:16:07.637
- You've made the right
choice, Mr. Moulton.

1:16:22.819 --> 1:16:26.348
- Lyn, will you marry me
when this is all over?

1:16:29.991 --> 1:16:30.858
- Yeah.

1:16:33.797 --> 1:16:34.257
- Well damn.

1:16:36.294 --> 1:16:38.767
I guess the therapy
worked after all.

1:16:38.802 --> 1:16:41.297
- Your blood,
signed on the dotted line.

1:16:46.172 --> 1:16:47.006
- And then you and her are free?

1:16:47.041 --> 1:16:47.776
- Indeed.

1:16:49.241 --> 1:16:50.405
- Just under the wire too, huh?

1:16:51.749 --> 1:16:52.814
You've got minutes left.

1:16:52.849 --> 1:16:54.684
- Yes. Swiftly please.

1:16:54.719 --> 1:16:55.377
Proceed.

1:16:59.284 --> 1:17:00.690
- I love you Elijah.

1:17:01.924 --> 1:17:03.385
- More
than you'll ever know.

1:17:05.862 --> 1:17:07.257
- What?

1:17:07.292 --> 1:17:10.194
- And then Tara says, "You're
a fucking traitor Lyn."

1:17:11.428 --> 1:17:12.094
- What, what are you? I don't-

1:17:12.129 --> 1:17:14.198
- That's your line, isn't it?

1:17:14.233 --> 1:17:15.463
"You're a fucking traitor Lyn."?

1:17:15.498 --> 1:17:16.937
- I don't know what you-

1:17:16.972 --> 1:17:21.172
- And then Joe says,
"She'll never love you.

1:17:21.207 --> 1:17:23.075
You'll die alone."

1:17:23.110 --> 1:17:24.472
- I, I don't understand-

1:17:24.507 --> 1:17:26.210
- Stop, please. Stop.

1:17:27.180 --> 1:17:30.313
Just stop.

1:17:32.790 --> 1:17:35.054
You knew I would never
sell my soul

1:17:35.089 --> 1:17:36.220
just because you asked me,

1:17:38.059 --> 1:17:39.091
but I want to be a hero.

1:17:39.929 --> 1:17:40.796
Right?

1:17:42.096 --> 1:17:43.161
That's my weakness.

1:17:44.868 --> 1:17:46.428
So you put on a little show.

1:17:47.464 --> 1:17:51.169
Got me to think I'm saving
you from these monsters.

1:17:52.205 --> 1:17:54.436
Sacrifice myself for you,

1:17:54.471 --> 1:17:57.340
but I'm not just saving you,
am I Lyn?

1:17:58.915 --> 1:18:02.114
I'm trading my soul for
all of you.

1:18:04.085 --> 1:18:07.416
You've been working me
together this entire time!

1:18:07.451 --> 1:18:08.989
- Dude. Just,
just please just...

1:18:11.323 --> 1:18:14.357
- I found your little script
in Joe's car.

1:18:18.803 --> 1:18:19.461
You lose.

1:18:20.937 --> 1:18:21.397
You're done.

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:23.366
It's over.

1:18:31.343 --> 1:18:32.815
Did you ever really
love me, Lyn?

1:18:35.182 --> 1:18:36.214
Tell me the truth.

1:18:47.128 --> 1:18:47.797
- Yes.

1:18:53.497 --> 1:18:54.397
- Get him!

1:18:54.432 --> 1:18:56.399
- Go!
- No!

1:19:46.319 --> 1:19:48.286
- Your children,
your grandchildren.

1:19:50.059 --> 1:19:51.487
It doesn't matter how
long it takes.

1:19:53.326 --> 1:19:56.899
Elijah, we won't stop
until we have y-

1:20:03.534 --> 1:20:06.942
No, no, please.

1:20:19.253 --> 1:20:22.419
- This is
the last time you fail me.

1:20:22.454 --> 1:20:23.453
Not like this.

1:21:56.449 --> 1:21:57.514
- You're Tara's driver, right?

1:21:57.549 --> 1:21:58.614
- Yes, sir.

1:21:58.649 --> 1:22:00.088
Can you let her know I'm here?

1:22:00.123 --> 1:22:01.683
- Hate to tell you this
man, but she's gone.

1:22:02.752 --> 1:22:07.392
I think her exact words were,
"Fuck this therapy bullshit."

1:22:07.427 --> 1:22:09.130
- Of course.

1:22:09.165 --> 1:22:10.593
Thanks anyways.
