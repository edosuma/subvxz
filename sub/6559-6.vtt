WEBVTT

00:50.176 --> 00:51.969
Shh!

01:24.502 --> 01:27.171
Like, Hawaii is the place for a vacation.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.674
- And food!
- Yeah, food.

01:30.007 --> 01:33.469
Hold it. This will make a good picture
for my newspaper.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.513
How's this?

01:36.013 --> 01:40.017
This tour you've taken us on
is the greatest, Mr. Simms.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.979
- That is, so far.
- So far?

01:43.145 --> 01:49.151
Sure. Like, visiting that ancient village
of a lost tribe tomorrow leaves me cold.

01:49.694 --> 01:52.029
Besides, there isn't going to be a luau.

01:52.488 --> 01:55.825
- But, Shaggy, that isn't part of my tour.
- I know.

01:56.033 --> 02:00.788
- The rest of the gang thought it up.
- Oh, no. You must not go there.

02:00.913 --> 02:04.542
- That ancient village is haunted.
- Haunted?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.171
Not even I would go there.

02:09.297 --> 02:12.133
- Then neither will we. Right, Scoob?
- Right, Shag.

02:12.550 --> 02:17.972
Smart thinking. Now, forget all
about ghosts and have a good time.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.266
Yeah. Yeah.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.312
I'll bet the gang at The
Pineapple Parlor...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.397
aren't having as much fun as we are.

02:28.691 --> 02:31.485
Ah! Ghost drums!

02:39.994 --> 02:42.830
Trespassers, hear me!

02:43.164 --> 02:47.793
You are on the forbidden ground
of Mano Tiki Tia!

02:48.169 --> 02:52.548
Leave at once or face his vengeance!

02:58.262 --> 02:59.305
Help!

02:59.472 --> 03:01.265
This way, Scoob!

03:05.186 --> 03:08.564
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

03:09.774 --> 03:13.819
Hey, where is everybody? Mr. Simms? Scooby?

03:14.278 --> 03:17.531
All gone! Everyone's vanished!

03:24.705 --> 03:28.667
After 47 luaus in a row,
I don't see how Shag and Scoob...

03:28.834 --> 03:30.544
could handle another one.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.880
You know those two. Always hungry.

03:33.172 --> 03:37.009
Besides, they're probably so stuffed,
they can't move.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.887
Ghosts!

03:41.931 --> 03:45.601
- Ghost drums! Witch doctors!
- What?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.813
Shaggy, get ahold of yourself.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.899
Like, okay, but it doesn't help.

03:52.525 --> 03:55.236
Where's Mr. Simms and Scooby-Doo?

03:55.403 --> 04:00.574
The natives, Mr. Simms
and Scooby-Doo vanished! Poof!

04:01.075 --> 04:05.704
Poof? I think you're full of poi.
But let's go find them.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.626
Shaggy, it's a scientific fact:

04:11.043 --> 04:14.130
People and Scooby don't just vanish, poof.

04:14.338 --> 04:19.593
Yeah? Like, it's also a scientific fact
that drums don't play without drummers.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.434
So where is everybody?

04:30.438 --> 04:33.649
I've got an idea. Let's ask that old man.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.734
What old man?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.153
He's gone!

04:37.361 --> 04:39.113
See any clues?

04:40.573 --> 04:41.782
No, but I hear one.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.451
Look!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.953
A ghost drum!

04:46.454 --> 04:48.456
Let's evacuate.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.126
Hey, it's gone.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.753
Then how come
the drumming's getting louder?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.589
Yeah.

04:59.800 --> 05:04.972
Yikes! It's there! Ask the ghost drum!

05:05.139 --> 05:06.599
Zoinks!

05:10.644 --> 05:12.938
Scooby-Doo, where were you?

05:13.105 --> 05:15.816
- Hiding.
- Hiding? You mean, scaring.

05:15.983 --> 05:19.153
Is this any way to greet your buddies?

05:20.196 --> 05:21.947
- Better?
- Better.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.993
Well, so much for Scooby's vanishing act.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.120
Now let's find Mr. Simms.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.830
- Let's don't.
- Right.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.334
Shame on you two. After
all, he's our host...

05:33.501 --> 05:36.003
and he took us to 47 luaus.

05:36.337 --> 05:40.508
- And there might not be a 48th.
- Another luau? Let's go.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.218
Right!

05:46.222 --> 05:50.601
- Hmm. Not a single clue.
- Look! On the ground.

05:50.726 --> 05:54.396
- All I see is dirt.
- A struggle took place here.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.899
There's where somebody was dragged away.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.401
That somebody must have been Mr. Simms.

05:59.610 --> 06:02.404
Let's follow it. Come on!

06:03.822 --> 06:07.326
- Hold it!
- First ghosts, now litterbugs.

06:07.493 --> 06:11.163
Hmm. A newspaper article written
by John Simms.

06:11.330 --> 06:14.208
His article tells about villagers
being terrorized...

06:14.375 --> 06:16.669
by a ghostly legend come to life:

06:17.002 --> 06:18.420
Mano Tiki Tia.

06:18.629 --> 06:22.633
He's investigating if the ghosts have
come back to haunt the islands.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.344
We've got another mystery on our hands.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.389
And the first thing to
do is find Mr. Simms.

06:28.556 --> 06:33.352
- And I bet he's in that ancient village.
- That's a perfect place for ghosts.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.729
Who wants to find an old haunted village?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.232
- Not us.
- Oh, yes, you do.

06:38.399 --> 06:42.361
Like, no way!
Besides, those tracks stop at the jungle.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.949
We can follow them in the jungle,
thanks to Scooby's keen tracking nose.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.536
Who? Me? What nose?

06:50.744 --> 06:54.248
Too bad. This Scooby
Snack smells delicious.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.041
A Scooby Snack?

07:00.254 --> 07:01.297
Hey.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.428
Sorry, Scoob. You had your chance.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.688
Zoinks!

07:26.614 --> 07:28.741
- Bats.
- Yeah, bats.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.452
Zoinks!

07:32.578 --> 07:34.246
Hey, look out!

07:34.413 --> 07:37.833
Look out? Like, all I
can see are your paws.

07:38.792 --> 07:43.922
Sorry, guys. It looks like I've not only
lost Shag and Scoob, but us too.

07:44.089 --> 07:47.092
So how will we ever find them
or the haunted village?

07:47.259 --> 07:51.305
- Any ideas, Fred?
- Not yet, but something will hit me.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.934
Wow! Now where is this?

07:56.101 --> 07:59.730
Hey, give a look up. Maybe it's a clue.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.817
It's Mano Tiki Tia.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.738
Well, thanks to Shag and Scooby,
we found the haunted village.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.783
It looks too creepy to be real.

08:10.949 --> 08:13.494
Like, it's real, all right.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.373
Let's have a look.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.759
- Zoinks!
- Let's get out of here!

08:32.846 --> 08:34.848
Whew! We lost him.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.183
What next?

08:40.521 --> 08:42.773
Daph, did you have to say that?

08:44.692 --> 08:48.195
Fred, Velma and Daph are still
in that creepy place.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.327
And I wish we were too.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.287
What is this place?

08:57.413 --> 09:00.833
I don't know,
and I don't think I want to find out.

09:00.999 --> 09:04.002
Hey, guys. Shaggy and Scooby got out.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.380
- Then this must be the way out.
- Well?

09:06.547 --> 09:09.425
It won't budge.
There must be another way out.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.093
Okay. Let's find it.

09:11.427 --> 09:15.097
- Hey, let us in before-
- Over there!

09:17.307 --> 09:20.811
Oh, no! And me without even my slingshot!

09:20.936 --> 09:23.564
Like, I guess a club will do.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.109
Okay, spooky! Come and get it!

09:30.446 --> 09:32.865
- Zoinks!
- Yikes!

09:45.210 --> 09:47.921
We'll need a torch. Shh.

09:49.465 --> 09:50.758
Shh.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.968
She's... She's disappeared!

09:53.260 --> 09:57.765
Now we have to find Mr. Simms,
Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.142
Look, Fred. It might be a way out.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.061
Or a way in to more danger.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.482
Wow. Oh, no!

10:08.609 --> 10:11.236
It's Mr. Simms' hat. They've got him!

10:11.570 --> 10:13.989
But they're not gonna get me.

10:34.885 --> 10:39.097
Come on, Scoob. Like, you're not really
afraid of ghosts, are you?

10:39.223 --> 10:45.312
- Uh-huh.
- Mano Tiki Tia!

10:45.479 --> 10:48.524
- Like, who said that?
- Not me.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.320
Well, that answers that.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.499
Phew. Thanks, Velma.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.837
In another moment, that freaky tiki
would've made poi out of this boy.

11:10.003 --> 11:13.173
- Me too.
- We're still not safe, so let's split.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.051
But old Terrible Tiki's after us.

11:16.218 --> 11:19.429
- Not only him, but also the-
- Witch doctor.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.933
Right, Scoob, the witch doctor.
But how did you know?

11:27.396 --> 11:29.189
Zoinks!

11:37.781 --> 11:41.285
Let's barricade the door! Come on, Velma.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.875
Like, thanks.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.216
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

11:56.675 --> 11:58.218
Uh-oh.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.807
Have a seat, doc.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.312
Shag? Velma? Scooby-Doo?

12:08.478 --> 12:11.565
Fred, there's nobody here but us.

12:18.989 --> 12:23.327
- Like, me Tarzan. This Jane.
- Yeah. Me Jane.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.245
Him Cheetah the chimp.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.083
You look for boy, girl and dog?

12:31.501 --> 12:34.296
Like, they went thataway.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.759
- Whew.
- It worked! What a lucky break.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.765
Like, some lucky break!

12:45.974 --> 12:47.309
Shh.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.729
- What did you see?
- Something on that table.

12:51.271 --> 12:55.025
Oyster shells and pearls.
This is a real clue!

12:55.233 --> 12:56.443
You're right.

12:56.610 --> 13:01.782
Now all we have to do is find everybody
and solve the mystery of Mano Tiki Tia.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.158
This way.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.328
Oh, my feet are killing me.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.373
It's a good thing we slipped
the witch doctor...

13:09.539 --> 13:11.750
or that wasn't all that'd get killed.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.252
Like, I'm too whacked to walk.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.757
Oh, boy! Let's fly. Look!

13:19.049 --> 13:20.968
Hey! An airplane!

13:21.969 --> 13:26.264
- It must have crashed here years ago.
- I don't think so.

13:26.390 --> 13:30.143
- What about all those vines?
- Plastic and definitely a clue.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.486
- It's a skinny spooky.
- No, Shag. It's not real.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.572
Look at your foot. See? It's a trip wire.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.408
It sure tripped me.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.494
Yes, but it also operated
that fake skeleton.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.413
And look what Scooby found:

13:49.579 --> 13:52.833
A tape recorder that
made the skeleton laugh.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.086
- Like, I sure fell for that trick.
- Naturally.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.840
I wonder why anyone would make
such an elaborate setup.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.801
Beats me, but I'm going
to have the last laugh.

14:02.926 --> 14:07.764
Hey, skinny, do you know why
the skeleton went to the library? Heh-heh.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.683
To bone up on a few things.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.602
See? I got the last laugh.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
Yow!

14:23.947 --> 14:26.366
We were hoping we'd bump into you guys.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.619
- Yeah, but not so hard.
- That's togetherness.

14:31.872 --> 14:36.043
With the clues we found so far,
the mystery is starting to piece together.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.212
Except we still haven't found Mr. Simms.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.468
- Footprints!
- Scooby's right. Footprints.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.137
- And they're fresh.
- Wonder where they go.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.972
- Let's follow them.
- Come on.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.397
Whoever he is, get him!

14:58.899 --> 15:02.486
I forgot my swim fins, but here goes!

15:13.955 --> 15:15.415
A secret cavern.

15:15.791 --> 15:18.960
That is the way out, I hope.

15:26.635 --> 15:31.139
- A secret entrance to the village.
- Yeah, but where'd the old man go?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.974
Who is that old man?

15:36.186 --> 15:38.355
Foolish mortals!

15:38.647 --> 15:44.069
You have returned to face
the wrath of Mano Tiki Tia!

15:54.204 --> 15:56.373
- We're trapped!
- Like, what do we do?

15:56.665 --> 16:00.669
- I say we get out of here.
- Brilliant!

18:00.413 --> 18:01.623
What is that?

18:03.708 --> 18:05.001
Whoops.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.753
WOW!

18:06.920 --> 18:10.006
- We did it!
- We certainly did, Scooby.

18:11.591 --> 18:16.137
It's sure strange the witch doctor could
get shook up by a jungle creature.

18:16.346 --> 18:19.516
Right. That's my plan,
to shake him up a lot.

18:19.683 --> 18:20.725
What's the action?

18:20.850 --> 18:25.522
First, let's get that trick amusement-park
mirror from the Mystery Machine.

18:26.231 --> 18:28.608
Now we hide it in the jungle like this.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.654
Next, Scooby and Shaggy play ghost drums
to lure the witch doctor.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.739
Right. Like, we're experts.

18:35.031 --> 18:39.035
Then when he sees his image in the mirror,
he runs down the trail...

18:39.202 --> 18:43.290
and plops into the giant pit
we covered with palm leaves and bingo!

18:43.456 --> 18:46.710
We capture the witch doctor
and solve the mystery.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.463
Stop clowning, Scoob.
It's time for spooking.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.965
Okay.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.057
Hey, Scoob. Pick up the beat.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.562
What you crying about? Zoinks!

19:17.657 --> 19:20.910
Yikes! Another witch doctor!

19:36.551 --> 19:38.511
Hang on, Scoob!

19:39.596 --> 19:42.390
Well, what do you know? We got him.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.853
Now for the unmasking.
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:47.854 --> 19:49.773
Mr. John Simms?!

19:49.939 --> 19:52.609
But what is a Mano Tiki Tia?

19:52.942 --> 19:57.530
See, Shaggy. It's like a parade float
operated by Mr. Simms' henchman.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.242
Now all the clues add up.
Simms engineered this hoax.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.120
The plan was to scare the villagers away...

20:04.329 --> 20:07.040
so they could poach
their pearl beds. Right?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.792
I'm not talking!

20:08.958 --> 20:13.338
Then he'd come to the haunted village
because nobody dared to follow ghosts.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.924
But he was at the luau with us.

20:16.091 --> 20:19.344
No. It was his pal disguised
as the witch doctor.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.471
What about the mysterious old man?

20:21.638 --> 20:23.723
Perhaps I can answer that.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.851
Lieutenant Tomoro, Hawaii
Police Department.

20:27.227 --> 20:32.148
I was on the trail of these pearl poachers
for a long time, but thanks to you kids...

20:33.566 --> 20:37.112
And you too, Scooby-Doo,
things got wrapped up in a hurry.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.365
Oh, well.
We still have one more vacation day left.

20:40.490 --> 20:43.076
And that day will be on me.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.584
Yahoo!

20:53.336 --> 20:54.963
Oh, no!

20:56.339 --> 20:59.175
Scooby-Doo, come back here with my poi!

21:05.181 --> 21:07.183
Scooby-Doo!

21:54.272 --> 21:55.315
Shh!
