Is it true it was a bus?

00:57.172 --> 00:59.130
- Was he on a bus?
Heard it was a bike.

00:59.130 --> 01:01.338
- I heard it was a school bus,
and he was driving.

01:01.338 --> 01:03.380
- Kate, was your father
a bus driver?

01:03.380 --> 01:04.755
A good, honest profession?

01:04.755 --> 01:06.880
- Okay, okay.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.880
My Dad was breaking in
some new sneakers.

01:13.088 --> 01:15.547
And uh, stumbled
into the bike lane.

01:15.547 --> 01:19.130
Where he was hit by a bike.

01:20.755 --> 01:23.672
Which launched him into a bus.

01:23.672 --> 01:27.547
The good news is that he died
before the bus hit him

01:28.880 --> 01:30.755
due to asphyxiation.

01:32.255 --> 01:34.672
He choked on a cough drop.

01:34.672 --> 01:35.672

01:38.005 --> 01:41.922
So, Kate, we'd like to present
you with this grieving plant.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.422
- This is...this is very nice.
Thank you.

02:01.505 --> 02:04.297
- So glad you made it. Ladies,
Ian asked if he could join,

02:04.297 --> 02:06.255
and I thought this would
be a great opportunity

02:06.255 --> 02:09.172

Jenny and I separated.

02:14.297 --> 02:16.880
It's better this way.
- Mm.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.797
