00:12.179 --> 00:15.808
<i>Here is the report
on your skin removal research program.</i>

00:15.808 --> 00:18.561
- It's ugly.
<i>I got my hands on some documents.</i>

00:18.561 --> 00:21.939
It's pretty graphic. Girls were killed.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.775
The leaked document exposes
Government's torture on women?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.652
<i>Honey, do you even realise
what you've done?</i>

00:26.652 --> 00:29.321
- You've risked my career too.
- That's what you're really concerned about

00:29.321 --> 00:31.240
is your political career.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.201
God, I don't even know
who you fucking are right now.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.495
<i>You ever just have one of those days
where you feel weird?</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:38.122
Yeah, like, every day.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.416
- Whoa!

00:40.416 --> 00:43.294
Did you feel that? That was like
the biggest static shock ever.

00:43.294 --> 00:44.295
You're beautiful, you know that.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.797
I could deal with it.
Why won't you just let me deal with it?

00:46.797 --> 00:47.882
Alright, Billy Big Bollocks.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.218
Come on! Come on!

00:51.218 --> 00:52.636
Oh, my God!

00:52.636 --> 00:54.263
- Oh, my God!

00:54.263 --> 00:56.724
Do something you believe in for once.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.100
Who are you--

00:58.100 --> 01:02.354
<i>Protection is our sacred duty. We gotta
show these powered bitches who's boss.</i>

01:02.354 --> 01:03.606
Whoa! What the hell is that?

01:03.606 --> 01:05.775
Urbandox.
- The guy talks shit on your mum.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.819
I want it, give it to me.

01:12.698 --> 01:15.951
<i>There have been signs for years</i>

01:15.951 --> 01:19.747
<i>that we were forgetting
what it meant to be men.</i>

01:19.747 --> 01:21.207
<i>Forgetting why we existed in--</i>

01:21.207 --> 01:25.669
<i>in these bodies, these bigger,
stronger bodies.</i>

01:25.669 --> 01:28.464
<i>What our function was for humanity.</i>

01:28.464 --> 01:32.176
<i>Men used to hunt, used to fight real wars.</i>

01:32.176 --> 01:35.179
<i>But somewhere along the line,
life got easy.</i>

01:35.179 --> 01:36.680
<i>We got soft.</i>

01:36.680 --> 01:40.851
<i>That's where this sickness,
this mutation came from.</i>

01:40.851 --> 01:44.355
<i>This happened to us, to humanity,
because we men,</i>

01:45.189 --> 01:46.732
<i>we forgot how to be strong.</i>

01:46.732 --> 01:49.318
<i>We forgot how to protect our homes,</i>

01:49.318 --> 01:51.028
<i>protect our women.</i>

01:51.028 --> 01:55.032
<i>So they developed this thing
to protect themselves.</i>

01:55.032 --> 01:57.868
<i>We got soft and lazy and lost.</i>

01:57.868 --> 02:01.455
<i>These bitches snuck in
and we didn't even put up a fight.</i>

02:01.455 --> 02:03.707
<i>We let them take it from us.</i>

02:05.459 --> 02:06.877
<i>But we can take it back.</i>

02:08.087 --> 02:09.547
<i>I promise you that.</i>

02:09.547 --> 02:12.424
<i>Fellas, we can grab that spot at the top.</i>

02:12.424 --> 02:14.802
<i>And for the good of humanity, we must.</i>

02:16.220 --> 02:18.681
<i>We have to reclaim our rightful place,</i>

02:18.681 --> 02:20.140
<i>whatever it takes.</i>

02:21.684 --> 02:24.812
<i>I'm talking about real power.</i>

02:24.812 --> 02:26.814
<i>Not some magic trick.</i>

02:27.481 --> 02:30.609
<i>Not sparkle-spirit fingers.</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:32.403
<i>These girls don't know how to fight.</i>

02:32.403 --> 02:34.113
<i>They're not bulletproof.</i>

02:34.113 --> 02:36.323
<i>So they have this... power.</i>

02:37.032 --> 02:37.908
<i>Good for them.</i>

02:39.201 --> 02:40.953
<i>We have real weapons.</i>

02:41.745 --> 02:43.038
<i>And we know how to use them.</i>

03:00.639 --> 03:01.932
Oh, come on.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.858
That's so fucking cool.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.942
Margot?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.111
- Uh... Yeah.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.406
Hey, I-- I got-- I got the wrong pants.

03:29.919 --> 03:33.839
You know you can--
you can sleep in here if you want.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.428
Well, I mean, do you want me to?

03:39.428 --> 03:41.847
You haven't said two words to me
since the other night.

03:41.847 --> 03:45.476
Well, actually just now,
I said at least, like, seven.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.403
It's just a lot going on.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.072
Yeah. I know, I know.

03:58.864 --> 04:00.199
Did you talk to the lawyer?

04:00.824 --> 04:03.661
Yeah, if my name gets out,
it could be bad.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.788
Civil fines for sure
but it's probably federal

04:05.788 --> 04:09.458
because it's classified documents
and that means possible jail time,

04:09.458 --> 04:11.794
but that's only if Declan gives
out my name and I know Declan,

04:11.794 --> 04:13.337
- he'd never do that to me.
- I don't understand

04:13.337 --> 04:14.546
where you get this certainty from.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.382
I mean, Declan's kind of a piece of shit,

04:16.382 --> 04:18.175
- how can you make sure?
- I'm gonna take care of it.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.259
You don't have to worry about it.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.095
Oh, OK.
I just don't have to worry about it.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.179
You're gonna take care of it.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.556
Yeah, I am.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.475
You also gonna...

04:27.601 --> 04:29.603
- apologise maybe?
- Oh, my God,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.063
- we did this already.
If there's any--

04:31.063 --> 04:32.398
I'm not-- I'm not doing that again.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.942
- Yep, you risked your job and mine.
Yeah, but I did the right thing.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.528
You risked our home,
our family, without talking to me.

04:37.528 --> 04:39.655
You remember when you used to care
about doing the right thing?

04:39.655 --> 04:41.073
- Oof.
Do you remember that?

04:41.073 --> 04:43.492
Yeah, well, you used to be
a person I could trust.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.995
That's not fair.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.372
OK. That's not fair.
You know you can trust me.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.915
I just feel, like, who are you?

04:49.915 --> 04:50.958
I...

04:50.958 --> 04:52.376
Who am I?

04:52.376 --> 04:53.919
I'm your fucking husband.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.713
- Who are you?
- I'm a woman with

04:55.713 --> 04:57.881
important work to do today
which apparently

04:57.881 --> 04:59.591
- I can't tell you about anymore.
- Fine. You know what?

04:59.591 --> 05:00.801
I don't wanna know.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.553
OK? I don't wanna know

05:02.553 --> 05:05.014
'cause I got shit to do and you know what?

05:05.014 --> 05:06.265
It's pretty important too.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.767
- Thank you very fucking much.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.325
Girl--
- No, no, we're not talking about my shoes.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.370
In fact, official mayoral policy
going forward,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.039
there will be no further discussions

05:30.039 --> 05:31.749
about my fucking footwear.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.834
OK! Noted.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.462
I'm not saying
I approve of the aesthetic but...

05:36.462 --> 05:38.380
- I like the energy.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.967
- What's going on with you?

05:41.967 --> 05:43.761
Oh, no.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.472
Margot, you didn't.

05:46.472 --> 05:49.975
- I did, I did!

05:57.524 --> 06:01.028
- And it's amazing.
- I do not believe you.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.072
- What were you thinking?
- Helen, I feel ten years younger.

06:03.072 --> 06:06.700
I could run a marathon.
Everything is brighter and lighter.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.160
I can take bigger breaths.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.371
I mean, I walk down the street and
it's like, "get the fuck outta my way."

06:11.371 --> 06:12.915
Oh, OK.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.542
I mean... do you want it?

06:15.542 --> 06:18.087
- Like, I could probably give it to you.
- No! Hell no!

06:18.087 --> 06:20.422
I've had a target on my back
since the day I was born.

06:20.422 --> 06:24.009
Last thing I need
is someone else to look at me sideways.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.096
- Fire my Black ass.
- Oh, no one's getting fired.

06:27.096 --> 06:29.139
Oh, they are.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.349
That shit has started.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.935
- Kristen, from <i>Tom and Kristen.</i>
- The morning show?

06:32.935 --> 06:35.354
She got fired just for having it.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.772
They can't do that, it's illegal.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.358
- It's discrimination.
- And yet...

06:39.358 --> 06:42.736
We have to find a way
to keep this quiet to manage this.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.118
Hey, hey, hey!

06:49.118 --> 06:52.663
- Do you wanna be down one chief of staff?
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.373
- Try me.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.589
Ha-ha! Woo!

07:04.758 --> 07:06.760
- Hey!

07:09.555 --> 07:12.349
<i>Hi! This is Ndudi,
I can't answer the phone right now,</i>

07:12.349 --> 07:14.810
<i>- so leave a message.</i>

07:14.810 --> 07:16.979
Hey, Ndudi, baby.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.523
Hey, listen, Mr Ojo is back home.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.900
I hope I'm seeing you at this wedding, eh.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.111
I need my-- I need my "zanku" partner.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.829
Uh, yeah, it's, um...

07:33.829 --> 07:35.497
It's been a while.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.333
It'd be, uh, good to-- good to see you.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.087
<i>Omo,</i> we are in trouble.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.672
- Let's go, let's go!
Can't you greet?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.382
I haven't seen you in how long, eh?

07:45.382 --> 07:46.800
- Let's go.
Brother, what's wrong?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.428
Pardon me,
you're seriously not gonna marry her

07:49.428 --> 07:50.804
because she took it.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.639
- Is it that serious?
- Yeah! How can I be the man

07:52.639 --> 07:55.684
of the house if my babes
can just spark me, anyhow?

07:55.684 --> 07:58.437
Hey, <i>Omo,</i> don't knock the divorce
until you try it.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.605
<i>- Ashawo.</i>

07:59.605 --> 08:01.523
Wait, you're just gonna throw
ten years away just--

08:01.523 --> 08:04.234
- just <i>jejely</i> like that?
- Ten years of lies.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.403
Wale, it's only been three months.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.280
No, we've never had secrets.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.199
- Never!
Ah, Wale...

08:10.199 --> 08:12.826
Heh? Hey, women don't lie to you, eh?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.412
You are being
very dramatic right now.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.497
Boy, you see what your problem is, eh?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.625
You like pushover girls.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.126
Pushover?

08:21.126 --> 08:23.003
Offend Fisayo and see
how she will pepper you!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.963
What the--
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.506
- OK. OK.
- You better watch your mouth.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.884
- Nobody is calling Fisayo a <i>mumu.</i>
- No.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.053
Listen, when I was in Riyadh--

08:31.053 --> 08:32.346
Hey! One moment, please,

08:32.346 --> 08:35.974
for my brother,
the international journalist, <i>Baba n'la.</i>

08:35.974 --> 08:38.518
- Thank you, thank you. Dami. Dami!
- Big bros!

08:39.603 --> 08:41.396
Let me get us some drinks, eh?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.815
Listen, I've seen some things.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.569
All right? This isn't a sex toy,
and it definitely isn't a reason

08:47.569 --> 08:49.488
for you to dump your fiancée.

08:49.488 --> 08:53.700
This is the future.
We're lucky to be alive to see it.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.037
This might bring...

08:57.037 --> 08:58.121
equality.

08:59.122 --> 09:03.543
Firstly, how is one of us
having electricity in our hands equality?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.462
Secondly, who says men
and women aren't equal?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.673
Wale! Look at you, look at you.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.341
Look at the size of your arms.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.301
Eh? One blow from you,

09:11.301 --> 09:13.887
- this girl's finished.
- Would I do that?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.348
And has she shocked you?

09:19.101 --> 09:21.812
You know, I don't remember you
being Mr. Women's Rights before all this.

09:21.812 --> 09:23.522
Ah, don't mind anymore.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.400
He's feeling guilty
because of Ndudi's face.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.235
- Fuck you, bro.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.405
What's your problem? Eh?!

09:31.405 --> 09:32.906
That's for the fucking honeymoon.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.201
Tunde, what's your problem?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.036
Fuck.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.621
Sorry, sorry. <i>Ma binu,</i> I'm just...

09:42.082 --> 09:45.627
- Just... Just sit down. Relax, huh?
- Fuck.

09:45.627 --> 09:46.795
Here, take it.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.802
Wale?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.304
Where did he go?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.095
Amen.

10:40.057 --> 10:43.518
I am so sorry.

10:54.196 --> 10:59.701
I'm sorry... about your mum...
and now all this.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.582
I'm sorry too.

11:09.086 --> 11:12.172
- And your mum still won't talk to me.
- Yeah, it's hard for her.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.466
Was it my fault that Bernie
was shagging my mum

11:14.466 --> 11:16.093
- when your mum was pregnant?
- But, you know,

11:16.093 --> 11:18.762
once, I asked Dad why me and you
were the same age.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.223
You know, what he did?
He bought me a dog.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.766
Of course he did.

11:26.645 --> 11:29.564
- Can I tell you something?
Always.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.400
I can't do this anymore.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.694
I don't wanna be a part of it,
Dad and the business.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.114
- When I go to uni, I'm done.
- Don't say that.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.282
I just want some peace, Rox.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.040
Well, you never did fit in.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.463
Ricky, the greasy one,
always up Dad's arse.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.260
- Terry was the thick one.
- Right.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.554
I love him to bits. But it's true.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.598
Yeah, it is true.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.766
And you, my little twin.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.643
A posh school with your posh mates.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.272
- I'm not posh.
- You read for fun though.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.695
I'll ask you something else.

12:16.695 --> 12:17.654
Yeah, go on.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.739
What did it feel like
when you killed that man?

12:27.456 --> 12:28.457
Felt good.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.050
<i>♪ I wanna kiss you until I lose ♪</i>

12:39.050 --> 12:40.427
<i>♪ My breath ♪</i>

12:42.220 --> 12:44.264
<i>♪ I don't wanna be your friend ♪</i>

12:44.264 --> 12:46.433
<i>♪ I wanna kiss your lips ♪</i>

12:49.561 --> 12:52.022
You look really pretty today.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.077
What?

13:07.245 --> 13:08.455
Nothing.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.249
OK then.

13:20.217 --> 13:21.301
Whoa.

13:23.512 --> 13:26.056
I'm not gonna hurt you.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.359
Jos, hold on.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.118
Jos, can we stop?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.789
Stop, Stop! Jos, I said stop!

13:50.789 --> 13:51.998
Ah!

13:51.998 --> 13:54.209
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.502
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.757
Here, here, use this.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.178
What the fuck, Ryan?

14:05.178 --> 14:08.515
I-- I asked you to stop.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.684
Look, Jos, it's not like I don't like you.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.936
Maybe I just don't want
to have sex in a parking lot.

14:12.936 --> 14:15.772
You fucked Karen McCullin
in a bathroom stall.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.024
Look, Jos, everything's different now.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.821
Jos! It's not like what you think, Jos!
Jos!

14:22.821 --> 14:24.489
<i>♪ I don't wanna be your friend ♪</i>

14:25.824 --> 14:28.368
<i>♪ Lose my breath ♪</i>

14:28.368 --> 14:31.788
<i>♪ I don't wanna be your friend ♪</i>

14:31.788 --> 14:34.499
<i>♪ Lose my breath ♪</i>

14:34.499 --> 14:36.209
Uh... what the hell?

14:37.627 --> 14:40.297
Hate mail. All of it.

14:40.297 --> 14:43.300
Head of Security says
he's never seen anything like this.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.677
Been doing this job going on 20 years.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.762
Well, I do aim to please
in this administration.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.807
Do you know what this is?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.938
- Dog shit?
- Fresh dog shit.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.065
Hmm? For the woman who has everything.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.276
It's not funny. I warned you about this.

15:01.276 --> 15:04.696
I told you, don't piss off the crazies.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.448
There are death threats in here.

15:08.617 --> 15:13.038
"Urbandox is right, you're a sparky cunt
who only cares about protecting

15:13.038 --> 15:14.497
other sparky cunts.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.499
- I'm gonna shove a hot iron up your--"

15:16.499 --> 15:18.126
OK, OK. I get your point.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.419
They're testing for EOD.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.172
- They're saying everyone has to do it.
- What? No, no.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.590
That-- that's not happening.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.217
- That's not even legal.
- It is actually,

15:26.217 --> 15:28.595
if it's in response to a statewide

15:28.595 --> 15:32.474
public health emergency
which I officially declared

15:32.474 --> 15:35.644
approximately four, now five minutes ago.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.192
Hi. Just figured I'd stop by seeing
as we don't make appointments anymore.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.194
- Daniel...
- Nice boots.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.946
We're not talking about the boots.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.948
I'll give you a moment.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.416
We can't do this.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.252
- It's a violation of privacy.
- No, it's data collection.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.630
Right? So we can better understand
the workplace.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.881
Keep people safe.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.174
Make informed assessments

16:06.174 --> 16:08.635
that help shape
best practices and policies.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.470
Best practices? So, what?

16:10.470 --> 16:13.807
You and who get to decide
the best practices for women with EOD?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.392
Yeah, we're not talking about all women

16:15.392 --> 16:18.061
with EOD, just those
working in government buildings.

16:18.061 --> 16:21.439
Oh, my God. This is--
This is invasive, it's unethical.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.566
- It's immoral, it's--
- OK, listen. Calm down.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.820
- I'm just asking for a list.
- It starts with a list,

16:26.820 --> 16:30.448
but you and I both know
that that list can become a weapon

16:30.448 --> 16:34.452
that can fire women
and I am not doing that to my staff.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.541
Well, you and your staff are welcome

16:39.541 --> 16:40.542
to decline the test...

16:43.294 --> 16:45.255
and go home
on unpaid administrative leave.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.381
That's your choice.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.847
I really do like the boots.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.808
They suit you.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.896
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

17:01.896 --> 17:03.773
- Fuck him! I'm not taking it.
Shh.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.942
I'm gonna walk right up to him
and I'm gonna tell him I've got it.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.570
Margot--
- I mean, he can't fire me.

17:08.570 --> 17:09.904
I'm an elected official.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.365
If you wanna stay an elected official
or get elected

17:12.365 --> 17:17.162
for any public office ever again,
keep a lid on it.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.788
The way that this is polling,

17:18.788 --> 17:20.790
people are not ready.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.377
Margot, think.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.088
Why do you think
Dandon is pulling this shit now?

17:27.088 --> 17:30.550
Because he is threatened by you.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.803
You are the only person
in this entire state

17:33.803 --> 17:37.474
that can give him a run for his money
for that Senate seat

17:37.474 --> 17:39.309
and he thinks you have this.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.145
So he's using all of this
to try to take you down.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.982
OK.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.651
OK.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.571
- What do I do?
All right, this says

17:51.571 --> 17:55.408
that the machine works by sending
an electric current through the body.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.826
Oh, my God, it's fucking mediaeval.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.787
The skein fills like a bladder

17:58.787 --> 18:02.040
and then the machine stimulates
an accidental discharge.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.750
Oh, how do I not do that?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.543
Oh, God. There's hardly anything here.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.671
It's all new technology,
which means it's fallible.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.257
OK, there's some
pain management techniques.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.593
Deep breathing. One woman beat the test

18:13.593 --> 18:15.845
- using the Lamaze me--

18:24.062 --> 18:27.649
Right, so...
pain management and deep breathing.

18:28.817 --> 18:32.403
Well, between childbirth
and childhood trauma...

18:34.656 --> 18:35.782
I got this.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.956
Mayor, please have a seat.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.175
Before we begin, I need to ask,

18:54.175 --> 18:58.263
do you have a pacemaker
or any other internal medical devices?

18:58.263 --> 18:59.806
You're not allowed to ask me that.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.644
The machine can interfere with
the function of certain medical devices.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.814
Ah. No, I don't.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.734
I understand this might feel intrusive.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.695
I had to take this test myself
earlier today.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.572
I know how frightening it can seem.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.198
I'm actually just very busy.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.952
Understood. This won't take long.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.912
Before me is an EOD test.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.998
An EOD test searches for the presence

19:24.998 --> 19:28.751
of a skein or electric static power,
also known as EOD.

19:28.751 --> 19:32.046
It is possible to test positive
for EOD without knowing that you have it.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.507
Results will be collected
and reported to the governor's office

19:34.507 --> 19:37.218
and other relevant state agencies.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.803
May I?

19:45.685 --> 19:48.605
The test involves
the passing of an electric current

19:48.605 --> 19:49.939
through your body.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.150
You may experience a tingling sensation,

19:52.150 --> 19:55.737
muscle movement or tension,
light-headedness, dizziness.

19:55.737 --> 19:58.114
How can you live with yourself doing this?

19:59.782 --> 20:01.576
If you find the results
of this test disturbing,

20:01.576 --> 20:04.954
counselling is available
to help you consider your options.

20:04.954 --> 20:05.955
All set?

20:18.718 --> 20:19.886
I don't feel anything.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.888
- Is it doing anything?
- Just... relax.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.732
- What are you writing?
- Mayor, please refrain from speaking

20:32.732 --> 20:34.400
until the test is over.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.360
Thank you.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.779
- OK.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.614
That's it?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.158
- Is it over?
- That's it.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.702
You passed.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.045
I'll see you in the primaries.

21:46.431 --> 21:48.599
I just need to get some air.

22:04.741 --> 22:05.908
Oh!

22:54.040 --> 22:55.792
<i>Scarlet Minnow?</i>

22:55.792 --> 22:59.128
Really? That's the best
you could come up with?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.380
I thought a girly name
might help cover your tracks.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.634
Also, yes, admittedly,

23:04.634 --> 23:06.511
- I was taking the piss.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.058
I don't know, Dec...

23:13.601 --> 23:15.853
Pressure's really on.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.523
- If they connect this back to me--
- Won't happen.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.983
I would never give them your name.
You know that.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.739
Tell you what, it's a good story.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.243
I'm off to Carpathia tomorrow
to do some follow up.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.536
Oh, great.

23:31.536 --> 23:34.205
Right. You get to globe trot,

23:34.205 --> 23:36.332
be a hero and probably win a Pulitzer

23:36.332 --> 23:38.501
and I get to live in the doghouse
for the rest of my fucking life.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.421
I gather the wife's still pissed, then?

23:42.421 --> 23:43.798
That's an understatement.

23:43.798 --> 23:47.218
I thought Margot was the type to enjoy
a good righteous whistleblower moment.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.553
She used to be.

23:48.553 --> 23:51.305
Now she's all about the politics.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.641
And you should hear
the way she talks to me.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.727
That's when she talks to me.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.772
Never had a problem being
with a powerful woman who's ambitious.

23:59.772 --> 24:03.985
I haven't. I mean...
The work she's doing is important.

24:03.985 --> 24:04.944
But?

24:06.654 --> 24:09.866
But... I didn't sign up for this.

24:12.493 --> 24:13.411
And neither did my kids.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.872
I mean, we're getting death threats
all the time now.

24:16.372 --> 24:17.957
My daughter can't even...

24:17.957 --> 24:20.501
can't even open up her own
fucking birthday cards.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.336
It's temporary.

24:22.336 --> 24:26.174
Nobody ever stays
on the front page... forever.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.050
Her 15 minutes will wean.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.344
And you'll go to couples counselling.

24:30.344 --> 24:34.307
Take a romantic vacay
somewhere with cocktails on a beach.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.351
I don't know, Dec, this is different.

24:38.269 --> 24:40.354
Can I get another round?
- I mean, the world's changing and...

24:40.354 --> 24:42.023
No, you are cut off.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.608
...she's changing with it.

24:44.692 --> 24:45.943
Give me a fucking drink!

24:45.943 --> 24:48.404
OK, Mike. See, this is why I can't.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.864
You're interrupting the nice men.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.449
Give me a beer, you bitch.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.202
OK, that's it.

24:54.202 --> 24:55.578
- Hmm?

24:55.578 --> 24:57.872
You got ten seconds to get out of here.

24:58.623 --> 25:01.000
- Ten, nine, eight, seven--

25:01.000 --> 25:03.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:03.294 --> 25:05.254
Evens the scales, don't you think?

25:05.254 --> 25:07.131
Miss Sparklefingers.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.884
I'm bigger than you,
I'm stronger than you.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.385
And I can zap you right back!

25:11.385 --> 25:12.637
Yeah, I bet you could,
I bet you could.

25:12.637 --> 25:13.721
But just come on, how 'bout that, huh?

25:13.721 --> 25:14.805
Come on, come on.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.557
She fucking threatened me! You saw!

25:16.557 --> 25:17.516
I'm defending myself.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.434
- Come on, pal.
Come on, Mike.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.435
Mike, right, yeah?

25:19.435 --> 25:20.645
- Yeah.
- Let's get some fresh air.

25:20.645 --> 25:23.689
- Next round's on me. Come on.
- Fuckin' threatening me!

25:23.689 --> 25:25.107
You think you're at the top,
you're not at the top.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.693
Y'all gotta learn your place.
Urbandox knows!

25:27.693 --> 25:30.112
Come on, Mike.
Yeah, bye, Mike.

25:51.717 --> 25:55.137
Um... Whatever you have, please.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.249
Hey, handsome man.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.500
Oh, excuse me.

26:36.679 --> 26:40.975
So the famous Tunde Ojo
finds himself back in Lasgidi?

26:40.975 --> 26:42.768
<i>- Omo,</i> I'm not famous.
- Really?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.813
You're this...
verified on all socials somebody.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.441
- Mr Million Hits!

26:53.487 --> 26:55.323
You have everything you ever wanted.

26:56.657 --> 26:57.658
Not everything.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.037
You want a drink?

27:01.037 --> 27:02.204
We have time.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.128
You know what? I'm not surprised
Wale wants to cancel the wedding.

27:09.503 --> 27:12.048
That boy was always muscle
and no strength.

27:12.048 --> 27:14.133
- Ah!
- Come on, you know it's true.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.968
So easily threatened.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.636
The boy wanted to look like a big man,

27:17.636 --> 27:19.013
but he behaves like a small boy.

27:19.013 --> 27:21.057
He's sensitive now.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.767
Ah, can't a man have feelings?

27:24.769 --> 27:26.979
I just mean his whole world
is upside down.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.314
Eh, give him a break.

27:34.862 --> 27:35.988
How was Riyadh?

27:37.865 --> 27:38.866
It was...

27:41.660 --> 27:42.661
hard.

27:47.708 --> 27:48.709
It changed you.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.548
It's life changing. All of it is.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.342
The freedom EOD has brought.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.428
Sisterhood.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.305
I've never seen it so strong.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.225
You've never seen sisterhood here?

28:04.225 --> 28:05.935
Well, I... No...

28:05.935 --> 28:07.770
No, I...

28:07.770 --> 28:10.272
I just-- I just wish
you could have come with me.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.440
- You know?

28:12.691 --> 28:13.859
You know I went because of you.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.071
Because of what you said that night.

28:17.822 --> 28:19.740
You were right, I was just...

28:19.740 --> 28:21.450
just one privileged <i>ode.</i>

28:24.453 --> 28:25.955
I wish you had come with me.

28:28.666 --> 28:29.792
I didn't know it,

28:30.626 --> 28:32.461
but I have work to do here.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.004
Hmm.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.214
What are you involved in?

28:36.799 --> 28:38.384
A coalition.

28:39.135 --> 28:42.763
We want to... to heal Nigeria.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.975
Let the rest of the world...

28:45.975 --> 28:49.019
look after themselves, eh? They always do.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.938
Yeah, well, their actions affect ours.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.440
Not if we strengthen from within.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.774
Ndudi, the world doesn't work that way.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.025
The world has changed.

28:56.819 --> 29:00.489
We have the opportunity for a...
a true matriarchy here.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.078
Dismantling the corruption
men have let destroy this country.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.631
I miss you.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.927
I don't want your pity.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.387
No, Ndudi, I don't, I...

29:23.387 --> 29:24.847
I need something else from you.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.039
Do you have it?

30:33.874 --> 30:35.209
You tell me, Tunde.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.652
You should write it down.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.863
Make a book of your travels.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.075
And where am I going?

31:10.828 --> 31:11.870
Everywhere.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.049
Come with me.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.887
My work is here.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.450
- Is the wedding on?
- Yes.

31:49.450 --> 31:50.659
Shit!

31:57.916 --> 31:59.543
Leave me alone!

32:00.294 --> 32:02.504
Jos, it's me. Matty let me in.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.487
Hi.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.658
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.368
I'm... I'm really sorry.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.329
I shouldn't have yelled at you in the car.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.666
My EOD doesn't work that well.

32:38.666 --> 32:40.918
Like it just, fritzes out sometimes

32:40.918 --> 32:44.380
and kinda takes over my whole body.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.010
I can get that
that must have been pretty scary for you.

32:50.928 --> 32:51.970
It's not that.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.847
Your power doesn't freak me out, Jos.

32:55.557 --> 32:59.812
Well, then, why didn't you wanna...

32:59.812 --> 33:01.814
I have something I need to tell you.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.449
I'm...

33:13.784 --> 33:15.160
intersex.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.454
I was born with both.

33:19.373 --> 33:22.376
I had surgery when I was a baby,
but I'm a guy.

33:22.376 --> 33:25.671
I... I identify as a guy.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.009
OK.

33:33.137 --> 33:34.138
OK.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.935
Well... I mean, I-- I...

33:39.935 --> 33:43.063
I like whoever you are.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.773
I mean, I like...

33:44.773 --> 33:47.109
I like you. And...

33:47.109 --> 33:51.572
I'm gonna keep liking you, you know.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.657
Yeah. Uh...

33:54.992 --> 33:56.034
I hope so.

34:16.972 --> 34:18.140
What the fuck?

34:21.935 --> 34:22.853
How?

34:22.853 --> 34:25.814
I have higher levels of oestrogen.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.319
I think that's why I can do this.

34:36.950 --> 34:38.118
How long have you had it?

34:39.453 --> 34:44.500
Um, since the day that you
accidentally zapped me, at your locker.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.293
I thought I was going crazy,

34:46.293 --> 34:47.961
but then I realized I wasn't the only one.

34:51.048 --> 34:53.217
So, you've had it...

34:54.468 --> 34:56.553
the entire time that we've been together?

34:57.471 --> 35:00.140
Like even when the girls
were getting pulled out of class?

35:00.140 --> 35:02.810
And I've been struggling with mine,
and you've just,

35:02.810 --> 35:04.812
you've had it this whole time.

35:05.479 --> 35:06.939
Well, I didn't...

35:06.939 --> 35:08.398
I didn't want anyone to find out.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.692
You know my mum has been risking her life?

35:11.735 --> 35:14.863
She's getting threatened every day
for protecting people

35:14.863 --> 35:17.908
who have skeins
and you've just been hiding yours.

35:17.908 --> 35:21.495
Jas, I'm a guy with EOD.

35:21.495 --> 35:22.913
You've seen those articles of girls

35:22.913 --> 35:25.040
getting their skeins cut out?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.416
Imagine what they'd do to me!

35:26.416 --> 35:28.210
OK, but I'm not asking you
to tell the whole world.

35:28.210 --> 35:31.213
I'm just asking you to tell me.
Your girlfriend!

35:31.213 --> 35:33.507
Yeah, well, I'm telling you now!

35:33.507 --> 35:35.759
And even if I wasn't, it's my body.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.886
I don't owe you anything.

35:39.596 --> 35:40.514
You know what...

35:43.851 --> 35:45.352
I don't need this.

36:00.534 --> 36:01.743
Fuck.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.706
Darrell? Dall?

36:08.250 --> 36:09.793
Oh, I think he's gone out.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.638
Don’t think I’m frightened of you.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.559
I could give it to you, Barbara.

36:25.559 --> 36:26.727
Don't want it.

36:28.729 --> 36:30.063
Might make you feel safe.

36:30.981 --> 36:32.608
I don't want it.

36:34.151 --> 36:35.193
Do you understand me?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.904
- All right.
- No, not all right!

36:36.904 --> 36:39.656
Not all right! You killed my boy!

36:39.656 --> 36:42.326
All these years,
I did everything I could to keep him safe.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.536
And then you come along,
and now he's dead!

36:44.536 --> 36:46.955
But you don't give a fuck!

36:46.955 --> 36:49.374
- I do give a fuck.
- He was my baby!

36:49.917 --> 36:51.668
I'm meant to protect him!

36:51.668 --> 36:53.962
- I'm so sorry.
- I want him here!

36:53.962 --> 36:55.213
I loved Terry.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.340
He was my brother.

36:56.340 --> 36:57.925
Oi, oi, oi!
- He wasn't your brother!

36:57.925 --> 36:59.509
He was nothing to do with you!

36:59.509 --> 37:00.510
He's mine!

37:00.510 --> 37:02.095
All right, baby, all right, all right.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.972
Come on, come on, eh? Come on.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.974
Let's go on, baby, all right.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.529
We're going out.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.326
Wipe your bloody nose.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.208
If you wanna tell me off or whatever,
can you just do it?

37:59.861 --> 38:01.321
Wish you a long life.

38:01.321 --> 38:04.199
Car accident, it's a nasty thing.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.909
Your poor boy.

38:05.909 --> 38:06.994
Yeah, it was.

38:07.703 --> 38:08.704
Nasty.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.749
So, got any more stingers for me?

38:12.749 --> 38:14.584
How 'bout you pay for the last lot first?

38:14.584 --> 38:16.128
Oh, yeah, I was getting to that.

38:37.107 --> 38:40.902
- What's this?
- His half. I'll get you the rest.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.654
Oh, we're not doing this again, are we?

38:42.654 --> 38:43.864
No, no. The thing is...

38:43.864 --> 38:45.532
All right, listen.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.159
- What is the thing, huh?

38:47.159 --> 38:49.286
What is the thing? Eh, eh?

38:51.455 --> 38:55.792
All right, you got me.
- Rox, shock him.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.673
Go on. Don't mind him.
You want that, don't you?

39:01.673 --> 39:03.216
Just a little.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.802
- No.
- I'm fine, eh.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.388
- Shock him.
- I don't want to.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.849
-"I don't want to."

39:10.849 --> 39:12.476
"I don't want to."

39:12.476 --> 39:14.227
Fuckin' hell. You kids!

39:20.150 --> 39:21.443
Now she shits herself.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.574
I get it, Dad. I fucked up.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.659
The way I went about, it was wrong.
But I'm not sorry that I did it.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.828
- You aren't?
- That man killed my mum.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.956
Are you for fucking real?

39:34.956 --> 39:38.210
Terry's not dead because of me.
It was bad luck.

39:40.087 --> 39:41.671
Don't push it, Roxy.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.215
He chose to come with me.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.716
He was the first one to pull a gun.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.384
They all knew why I was going there.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.389
That's enough, Rox. All right?

39:52.390 --> 39:54.142
- Don't push me.
- Or what?

39:54.142 --> 39:57.020
- Don't fucking push me!
- Or what?

40:14.079 --> 40:14.996
How was your day?

40:17.958 --> 40:19.251
Oh, um...

40:20.168 --> 40:23.171
My day was... It was just great.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.256
Yeah, yeah, great.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.134
Thank you for asking.

40:29.136 --> 40:31.179
Jos? How was your day?

40:32.722 --> 40:34.099
I don't wanna talk about it.

40:35.517 --> 40:36.685
OK.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.021
- Matty?
- Are you guys getting a divorce?

40:40.021 --> 40:42.357
What? [scoffs] No.

40:42.357 --> 40:45.360
No. Come on.
Why would you ask something like that?

40:45.360 --> 40:47.237
Because we're doing
this whole dinner table thing.

40:47.237 --> 40:50.282
- Well, families eat at dinner tables.
- Not this one.

40:50.282 --> 40:52.242
- Just not lately, that's all.
- It's-- Look...

40:52.993 --> 40:53.994
It's weird.

40:53.994 --> 40:55.287
Yeah, it's weird.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.583
Hannah at school's parents got a divorce.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.793
And she has two Christmases.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.170
So many presents.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.797
OK, we are not getting a divorce.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.340
I just...

41:07.340 --> 41:09.426
wanted us to sit together.

41:09.426 --> 41:10.802
Without distraction.

41:11.928 --> 41:13.388
Because, um...

41:14.598 --> 41:16.808
I made a big decision today.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.976
Professionally.

41:18.643 --> 41:20.437
And it's gonna effect the whole family.

41:21.813 --> 41:22.731
Uh...

41:23.940 --> 41:25.942
I've decided to run for Senate.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.154
Congrats.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.989
Thanks!

41:37.621 --> 41:39.039
That's great.

41:39.039 --> 41:40.999
That's really great. I'm so proud of you.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.460
I know how hard you worked for this.

41:43.460 --> 41:44.753
Well, you don't have my vote.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.005
Oh, come on, Matty. She's your mum!

41:47.005 --> 41:49.591
You can't even vote anyways. You're 15.

41:49.591 --> 41:50.759
Can you tell me why, Matty?

41:50.759 --> 41:52.135
Can you help me understand?

41:52.135 --> 41:53.678
Why, why bother?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.513
It's not like the male voice
even matters anymore.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.933
- Of course your voice matters, honey.

41:57.933 --> 41:59.809
I think men and women
need to know their place.

41:59.809 --> 42:01.394
- What?
- Everything is backwards.

42:01.394 --> 42:03.271
Like-- like, even in this family.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.856
Dad does all the cooking, you never cook.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.984
Well, that's because
Dad is a better cook and he likes it.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.194
I-- I do like it.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.445
We play to each other's strengths.

42:10.445 --> 42:12.072
Go team Cleary-Lopez, you know?

42:12.072 --> 42:13.490
You emasculate him!

42:14.157 --> 42:15.408
And he just takes it.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.495
That is not true.

42:18.495 --> 42:20.038
I mean...

42:20.038 --> 42:21.539
Where did you even learn that word?

42:21.539 --> 42:24.584
- Urbandox?
- You listen to Urbandox?

42:24.584 --> 42:25.961
You know he hates us!

42:25.961 --> 42:27.504
No, he just doesn't agree with you!

42:27.504 --> 42:29.172
We're still allowed to disagree, right?
It's a free country.

42:29.172 --> 42:31.967
Oh, my God,
you sound like a fucking moron!

42:31.967 --> 42:33.468
All right, all right. Can you just stop?

42:33.468 --> 42:34.552
- What?
See?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.721
You don't wanna hear what I really think.
No one does!

42:39.766 --> 42:41.726
- I'll go talk to him.
No, no.

42:41.726 --> 42:42.811
I got it.

42:52.195 --> 42:54.406
Are we done with this meeting now?

42:54.406 --> 42:56.199
Can I go eat dinner on the couch?

42:58.743 --> 43:00.328
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

43:13.591 --> 43:14.801
Do you wanna go outside...

43:15.844 --> 43:16.803
with me?

43:21.141 --> 43:22.600
Yeah, fuck it.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.769
But jus-- just this one last time.

43:24.769 --> 43:25.854
Yeah.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.030
Thanks.

43:39.993 --> 43:41.286
You've got my vote.

43:43.204 --> 43:44.122
For what that's worth.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.083
Really?

43:47.083 --> 43:49.044
You don't think I'm crazy for running?

43:51.546 --> 43:53.340
We need somebody to fight for us.

43:54.132 --> 43:57.302
I mean, people shouldn't feel afraid
to admit that they have this thing.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.014
It's all so fucked up.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.228
Dandon made everyone
get tested at work today.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.730
I passed.

44:08.730 --> 44:11.316
Turns out I have amazing capacity

44:11.316 --> 44:14.402
for dealing with... discomfort.

44:15.528 --> 44:18.198
OK, but what's gonna happen
when they find out you do have it?

44:21.451 --> 44:22.535
Have you even told Dad yet?

44:26.373 --> 44:29.209
- Mum, you have to tell him.
- Yeah, I know, I know. Just not yet.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.379
No one's going to elect
a senator with EOD.

44:32.379 --> 44:33.588
I don't want to put him in that position.

44:33.588 --> 44:36.007
You know he has to do press
and make appearances.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.133
I don't want him to have to lie.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.052
So you're asking me to?

44:39.052 --> 44:41.346
No. Jos.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.639
I'm sorry.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.396
I know this is gonna sound bad,

44:49.396 --> 44:51.856
but sometimes you have to lie
to the people you love.

44:53.316 --> 44:54.609
To protect them.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.029
Us having EOD, oh, my God,

44:58.029 --> 45:00.990
it just makes winning
so much more important. I can't...

45:03.743 --> 45:06.579
I can't even imagine
what Dandon would do in the Senate.

45:10.291 --> 45:11.793
I get it.

45:20.301 --> 45:24.764
Dad is a really bad liar to be fair.

45:24.764 --> 45:27.308
He can't even pull off a surprise party.

45:27.308 --> 45:29.310
He just blurts it out loud.

45:44.742 --> 45:45.827
It's just till the election.

45:49.622 --> 45:50.623
I got you.

46:06.890 --> 46:09.184
Sparklefingers unite.

46:13.980 --> 46:16.483
No. No.

46:25.533 --> 46:28.328
Governor Dandon
would segregate our schools.

46:28.328 --> 46:31.456
He would keep our girls at home,
studying remotely.

46:31.456 --> 46:34.042
Well, what we've learned from history,

46:34.042 --> 46:37.670
what the courts of this nation
in their wisdom determined,

46:37.670 --> 46:40.006
is that separate is not equal.

46:43.968 --> 46:47.805
And what I know, in my admittedly
modest wisdom as a mother

46:47.805 --> 46:49.098
and as a human,

46:49.098 --> 46:53.686
is that we are at our best
when we are unified as a people.

46:53.686 --> 46:57.357
When we live and behave
equitably and communally.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.989
I don't know about you, but, um,

47:04.989 --> 47:08.868
I'm tired of fighting
the same battles for my daughters

47:08.868 --> 47:10.662
that I've been fighting my whole life.

47:10.662 --> 47:12.622
And that my mother fought before me

47:12.622 --> 47:15.124
and that her mother fought before her.

47:15.124 --> 47:17.585
And it looks like Mother Nature's
had just about enough, too.

47:21.422 --> 47:24.259
This power is evolution.

47:24.259 --> 47:27.804
This power is an opportunity
for re-invention.

47:27.804 --> 47:30.557
To approach society in a new way.

47:30.557 --> 47:33.935
To apportion power
in this world more equitably.

47:40.483 --> 47:45.071
And that is why, I,
Margot Cleary-Lopez, your mayor,

47:46.072 --> 47:47.532
am running for Senate.

48:00.336 --> 48:02.088
<i>This is a war.</i>

48:04.382 --> 48:06.926
<i>A war to reclaim what is rightfully ours.</i>

48:06.926 --> 48:08.177
<i>Our birthright.</i>

48:16.853 --> 48:21.024
<i>A war to reclaim
what humanity was meant to be.</i>

48:26.279 --> 48:28.823
<i>It's time to make
the world stop and listen.</i>

48:34.746 --> 48:37.206
<i>It's time to fight fire with fire.</i>

48:38.207 --> 48:39.876
- Get down!

48:39.876 --> 48:40.918
Get down!

<i>This one here
seems to be emerging as a leader.</i>

50:57.472 --> 50:59.974
Go tell my sister
a big change is coming.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.642
And I need her to pick a side.

51:01.642 --> 51:03.936
I bought you some jewellery.

51:03.936 --> 51:07.940
I'd like to see how my eldest
and my youngest work together.

51:07.940 --> 51:10.026
You know Dad's fucking with you,
don't you?

51:10.026 --> 51:12.945
Have we met before? You look so familiar.

51:12.945 --> 51:14.155
<i>I'm not afraid of you.</i>

51:14.155 --> 51:17.617
I'm gonna find out who you really are
and send you back where you belong.

51:17.617 --> 51:20.453
<i>She's right.
I'm a fraud. I'm a killer.</i>
