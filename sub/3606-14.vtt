00:00.634 --> 00:04.837
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:08.307
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:10.209
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:11.944
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.946 --> 00:16.048
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.050 --> 00:18.150
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:22.621
<i> until recently when an</i>
<i> accident forced me to</i>
<i> reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:26.058
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:29.561
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.563 --> 00:31.530
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:34.233
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:39.104
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:39.106 --> 00:41.106
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:41.108 --> 00:44.243
She's one of Max's
deranged science projects.

00:44.979 --> 00:46.111
What the hell is going on?

00:46.113 --> 00:47.379
You're under arrest.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.349
Oh, my god.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.818
My sister needs your help.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.086
What do you need me to do?

00:54.922 --> 00:56.321
Come back to us, Kara.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.193
(Grunts)

01:03.597 --> 01:04.863
(Gasping)

01:04.865 --> 01:05.998
What happened?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.266
I killed her.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.501
Kara...

01:15.476 --> 01:16.542
(Air whooshing)

01:21.415 --> 01:22.848
Hmm...

01:22.850 --> 01:25.484
-I should probably
just go to bed.
-(Clicks tongue)

01:26.554 --> 01:28.720
I have to see
miss Grant tomorrow.

01:28.722 --> 01:33.392
And between what happened with
Adam and missing work, it's...

01:34.628 --> 01:35.994
Oh, it's bad.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.831
-It's really bad. (Groaning)
-Mmm-mmm. Okay, come here.

01:38.833 --> 01:39.932
No thinking.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.266
-Just hugging.
-(Chuckling)

01:43.771 --> 01:45.804
You want to know
the really messed up part?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.172
Hmm?

01:47.675 --> 01:49.208
I miss astra.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.813
I was getting
through to her, Alex.

01:54.815 --> 01:58.150
If I had just had a little
more time, I could've
brought her home.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.852
Brought her back.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.355
If Hank hadn't...

02:04.859 --> 02:09.061
Kara, there's something
i need to tell you...

02:09.063 --> 02:10.496
-(Thud)
-(Both gasping)

02:12.600 --> 02:13.599
(Chuckles)

02:13.601 --> 02:15.334
-Just jumpy, I guess.
-Yeah.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.170
Non: It would be
so easy to kill you.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.339
Get out.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.174
I need you to come with me.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.242
Not a chance.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.877
You have
no part of this, human.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.247
I come for astra.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.217
Not myself.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.353
Kara, no.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.621
I'll be all right.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.202
She would have
wanted you here.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.806
It is our custom

02:55.910 --> 02:58.710
for a surviving female
to lead the rites.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.516
Do you remember
the prayer for the dead?

03:15.896 --> 03:16.962
(Shuddering)

03:17.798 --> 03:18.897
(Inhales deeply)

03:20.601 --> 03:22.901
You have been
the sun of our lives.

03:25.172 --> 03:29.241
Our prayers will be the sun
that lights your way on
the journey home.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.812
(Sniffles)

03:36.684 --> 03:39.618
We will remember you
in every dawn.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.521
(Voice breaking) And await the
night we join you in the sky.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.927
Rao's will be done.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.443
(Softly) I shall observe
the period of mourning.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.412
And then, Kara Zor-El,

04:09.516 --> 04:12.851
the next coffin
shall be yours.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.163
Hank henshaw: How long
before non returns?

04:25.165 --> 04:26.798
Supergirl: Two weeks.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.201
We give up daily toil and lend
our hearts to the loved ones

04:29.203 --> 04:32.537
making the journey home
to rao, the sun god.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.206
We light their way.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.308
And you think he can be
trusted to observe
this mourning period?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.910
Do you think he's going
to let his wife walk alone
in the dark?

04:40.347 --> 04:42.848
-I simply...
-Thank you for coming in.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.483
We're at war.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.019
We're going to have
to do a lot of things
we don't want to do.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.788
Vasquez: Ma'am.
Sorry to interrupt.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.491
Prisoner 5090 is
demanding to see you.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.294
Hmm, day just keeps
getting better.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.798
I can't let this
go on much longer.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.333
Yes, you can.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.468
She deserves to know
the truth. And it's
not fair to you.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.270
I can take her hating me.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.439
If you tell her you killed
astra, she'll have lost
you, too.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.475
-She needs you, Alex.
-It's not right.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.378
Maybe. But it's what she
needs to keep going.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.654
Maxwell: Back to
your old self, I see.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.523
I suppose I owe you
a thank you.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.759
(Scoffs) You owe me
more than a thank you.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.862
I assumed my heroic save
would earn me early parole.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.931
So you can tell
the world who I am?

05:32.933 --> 05:36.535
Put my family in danger?
Try to kill me again?

05:36.537 --> 05:38.136
I'm just trying
to protect the planet.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.438
From what?

05:39.840 --> 05:40.706
From me?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.841
When the gods walk the earth,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.444
it's us tiny mortals
who end up suffering.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.647
So nothing for
my largesse then?

05:48.649 --> 05:51.283
I was told you asked
for and received netflix.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.884
(Chuckles)

05:52.886 --> 05:54.619
You thought
i was dangerous before.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.555
You have no idea how dangerous
i get when I'm bored.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.090
I recommend <i> call the midwife.</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:00.759
Without me, you'd be dead!

06:00.761 --> 06:03.095
Without you,
the world is a better place.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.303
(Elevator bell dings)

06:11.305 --> 06:13.271
Hey, we have a problem.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.873
Yeah, I know. I have two weeks

06:14.875 --> 06:17.576
before my uncle launches
an actual blood feud
on this planet.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.511
(Stammering) Yes,
that is very bad, granted,

06:19.513 --> 06:20.912
but this is up there...

06:20.914 --> 06:23.215
Oh, winn, I will deal
with miss Grant.

06:23.217 --> 06:27.018
I know she's upset with me,
but her and I have been
through a lot and what...

06:29.123 --> 06:31.123
Why is there a desk here?

06:31.125 --> 06:34.993
And, uh, how do you
pronounce that name?

06:36.497 --> 06:38.096
Uh, good morning, miss Grant.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.197
Ker-rah.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.900
Hmm, I see you've met Siobhan.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.801
I'm sorry, who?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.936
Good morning. Siobhan Smythe.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.674
You pronounced
that name correctly.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.978
Well, I could see that your
job was beginning to strain
your abilities,

06:52.980 --> 06:55.814
so I took it upon myself
to hire another assistant
to help you.

06:55.816 --> 07:00.519
-(Chuckles nervously)
-Assistant number one,
meet assistant number two.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.554
I'm two?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.122
Your coffee, miss Grant.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.057
I hand-pressed it myself using
beans grown in the shade

07:06.059 --> 07:08.894
of guava trees on the slope
of mount baru in Panama.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.097
Uh, your latte, miss Grant.
From noonan's. Your favorite.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.799
Get Olsen and Lane
into my office.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.600
I need someone to take notes.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.502
Uh, I got it.

07:17.504 --> 07:18.837
You cover the phones,
assistant number two.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.006
Assistant number one,
come with me.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.611
Winn: Oh, uh...

07:26.613 --> 07:29.047
How long do you think cat's
new mini-me will last?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.782
Not long.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.786
No, cat is mad at me
so she hired someone else
to teach me a lesson.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.989
I mean, the poor girl
is a pawn, really.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.392
I kinda feel sorry
for her, actually.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.960
Sure, yeah.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.528
I do.

07:43.530 --> 07:46.264
So, I'm gonna
give her a chance.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.801
That's Supergirl's line.
It's okay for Kara danvers
to be upset.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.271
(Chuckles) I'm not upset.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.806
You just broke your phone.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.487
(Phone ringing)

08:10.190 --> 08:12.524
Cat: Eavesdropping!

08:12.526 --> 08:15.794
There is a major glitch
in lord's newest phone

08:15.796 --> 08:18.830
that lets your last caller
eavesdrop on your next caller.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.932
Now, normally, Max would be
out front and center

08:20.934 --> 08:23.034
trying to do some
damage control,

08:23.036 --> 08:26.838
but he's sent
his PR hack. So...

08:26.840 --> 08:28.306
What does that even mean?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.175
Maybe he's embarrassed.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.178
No. No, you can't embarrass
someone who doesn't
feel any shame.

08:33.180 --> 08:37.449
I believe that
Max lord is missing.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.552
I think it may be a little
too early to jump
to that conclusion.

08:40.554 --> 08:45.357
In the media, "early"
only applies to
Botox and bananas.

08:45.359 --> 08:49.127
Yeah, but Maxwell lord has
a billion dollars and the
entire world at his disposal.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.696
I mean, he could be
anywhere doing anything...

08:51.698 --> 08:55.600
(Sighs) Yes. Well,
that's true. You're right.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.610
Okay. Well,
he's either having,

09:05.612 --> 09:09.848
one, an affair with
Jennifer Lawrence at
musha cay, again,

09:09.850 --> 09:13.251
or two, he's developing some
revolutionary technology

09:13.253 --> 09:15.620
that's going to change
the course of human history,

09:15.622 --> 09:18.089
or three, he's been kidnapped.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.425
So, it is up to me
to save him.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.994
Oh, the burden of power.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.230
You, leave.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.403
You. Questions?

09:31.405 --> 09:33.338
What do you want me to do?

09:33.340 --> 09:35.340
Exploit your connections
at the Pentagon. I'm sure
they're all over this.

09:35.342 --> 09:39.778
And James, my crack
investigative photojournalist,

09:40.414 --> 09:41.680
get cracking.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.286
We have to talk.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.188
I can help you, Mr. Olsen.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.924
Miss Grant said I was
to handle all matters
with department heads.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.127
And on a personal note,

09:56.129 --> 10:00.665
it would be an honor to assist
an artist of your caliber.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.934
(Chuckles)

10:02.936 --> 10:04.202
Um, maybe some other time.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.772
-Kara?
-Sure.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.281
Kara, what am
i supposed to do?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.716
I know exactly where Max is.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.818
(Sighs) I'm sorry
you have to lie.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.353
It's not just the lying.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.655
It's everything that you
and the deo are doing
with Max.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.323
You're holding him
against his will,

10:25.325 --> 10:27.859
without due process,
without a trial.
It's just wrong.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.127
He tried to kill me.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.897
Nobody's saying
he's a good guy.

10:32.899 --> 10:36.067
Keeping Max behind bars is
the only way we can prevent
him from hurting more people.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.036
That is what
the justice system is for.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.306
His army of lawyers would
have him out in two minutes
and you know it.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.974
Kara, I know he's dangerous.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.276
Okay, but he still deserves
his fundamental human rights

10:45.278 --> 10:49.714
and protecting those rights
and respecting those rights
are what make us who we are.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.020
Kara: James, I hear you,

10:55.022 --> 10:56.821
but it's not your job to worry
about the deo's ethics.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.725
It's not the deo's ethics
I'm worried about.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.829
Hank henshaw:
We've got a rogue.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.933
Fort rozz prisoner
number 2444.

11:08.935 --> 11:13.004
He's been hiding out in
national city using a human
alias, Gabriel Phillips.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.341
Surveillance spotted
him yesterday.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.910
Don't be fooled by the pretty
face, this thing is nasty.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.912
Feeds off rotting flesh.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.381
He's been spotted coming and
going from an abandoned
warehouse downtown,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.517
<i> where we suspect</i>
<i> he's storing his food.</i>

11:25.519 --> 11:28.853
<i> Proceed with caution</i>
<i> when apprehending him.</i>
<i> This one bites.</i>

11:34.227 --> 11:35.460
On my three.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.363
One, two, three. Go.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.271
Man: Help me!

11:50.911 --> 11:52.510
(Softly) Help me.

11:52.512 --> 11:53.778
He's here.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.918
(Powering up)

12:01.254 --> 12:02.320
Alex: Set him free!

12:21.842 --> 12:23.541
Agent danvers,
are you all right?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.743
We were ambushed, sir.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.144
The hostile's gone.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.045
He fled?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.347
No. He was abducted.

12:35.589 --> 12:39.424
Looks like your masked
kidnapper was using advanced
extra-terrestrial weaponry.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.760
Well, the big question is,
where did he take our target?

12:41.762 --> 12:44.662
-And why?
-Maybe he had some beef
he needed to settle.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.366
Since when don't you call me?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.435
I thought it might be
a good idea to give
you some time off.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.138
When I need time off,
I'll fill out a request form
with hr.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.275
Until then, if there's
a dangerous alien to catch
I'd like to be included.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.543
Sir.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.781
Is he human?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.449
Alex: Couldn't tell
under all that armor.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.052
What would he want with an
alien who eats rotting flesh?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.487
The vulture he captured

13:09.489 --> 13:11.089
could be wanted
on a dozen other worlds

13:11.091 --> 13:13.925
for crimes he committed
long before he wound
up in fort rozz.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.528
We could be dealing with
an interstellar bounty hunter.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.896
You don't think...

13:18.331 --> 13:19.564
No. No.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.899
If he were in town, we'd know.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.134
(Sighs)

13:23.136 --> 13:24.769
Alex: I ran all the
images of the kidnapper
through our database.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.504
Nothing matches up.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.007
Maybe if he's done this
before, he's run into
local law enforcement.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.608
We could interview ncpd.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.977
See if some of their
missing persons are
our missing aliens.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.879
Where do you think
he took that guy?

13:34.881 --> 13:38.483
As far as we know, he could be
anywhere in the galaxy.

13:38.485 --> 13:42.187
Master jailer:
<i> You are fort rozz</i>
<i> prisoner 2444.</i>

13:42.856 --> 13:44.556
<i> Guilty of armed theft</i>

13:45.058 --> 13:46.925
<i> and murder.</i>

13:46.927 --> 13:51.563
<i> Disguising yourself in human</i>
<i> skin will not keep you</i>
<i> from facing justice.</i>

13:51.565 --> 13:52.864
<i> Show yourself.</i>

13:52.866 --> 13:54.566
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.840
<i> By breaking the law,</i>
<i> you have forfeited</i>
<i> your right to exist.</i>

14:01.842 --> 14:04.542
They is no death penalty
on Krypton.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.211
<i> We're not on Krypton.</i>

14:11.117 --> 14:13.284
(Panting) Is this
what you want?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.720
Will you let me go now?

14:15.722 --> 14:17.555
<i> No one escapes</i>
<i> the master jailer.</i>

14:17.557 --> 14:18.590
Wait.

14:18.592 --> 14:20.191
I know who you are.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.259
No. No!

14:22.729 --> 14:23.995
-Don't kill me!
-(Squelching)

14:29.369 --> 14:31.736
(Knocking on door)

14:31.738 --> 14:34.739
Agents danvers
and henshaw. FBI.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.341
I'm detective Warren.
He's draper.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.744
We're looking into a recent
kidnapping in national city.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.579
This is our primary suspect.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.349
Halloween already, huh?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.718
-(Chuckles)
-Any help would be
much appreciated.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.753
Feds come crawlin'. (Chuckles)

14:49.389 --> 14:50.989
You must be embarrassed.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.925
As long as the job gets done,
doesn't matter who helps.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.360
I mean, look at you guys.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.228
Meaning?

14:57.230 --> 15:00.398
Crime's gone way down
in national city over
the last few months,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.500
a lot of thanks to Supergirl.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.903
But you don't mind
that she helps, do you?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.738
I got an interview
with a donut.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.873
-Wouldn't want to be late.
-Yup.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.146
Sorry about Warren.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.716
He's a good cop. He's just,
uh, not enlightened.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.051
Anything you can tell us.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.320
Not much.
We don't know who this guy is.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.522
We know he's been kicking
around for months, though.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.857
There's been
other kidnappings?

15:25.859 --> 15:27.592
At least five that we know of.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.860
But, he's, uh,

15:30.697 --> 15:32.196
he's not just kidnapping them.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.605
We found all
the bodies down by the river.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.007
All of them decapitated.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.676
How could we not have
heard about this?

15:44.678 --> 15:50.481
The mayor wants this
kept quiet, but all
the victims were weird.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.849
Weird, how?

15:51.851 --> 15:53.318
One of them had gills.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.320
Like a fish.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.387
Hmm.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.891
Hope that helps.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.426
-Thank you, detective draper.
-Yeah, thank you.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.694
Got it.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.033
There's an alien serial killer
in national city.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.802
We need to find out
who's next.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.713
(Computer pinging)

16:26.820 --> 16:28.119
What do you mean?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.461
No. We're just friends.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.929
No benefits.

16:37.931 --> 16:40.331
Except the benefit
of friendship.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.440
(Sighs)

16:49.442 --> 16:50.808
I can't help what you think.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.483
I'm not obsessed with anyone!

16:58.485 --> 17:01.619
Ker-rah. Inside voice. Please.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.388
More like number one.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.089
She hasn't made a peep.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.227
(Cell phone ringing)

17:11.831 --> 17:14.665
-Alex, what's up?
-Alex: <i> We need you at the deo.</i>

17:14.667 --> 17:18.369
I'm dealing with
a problem right now.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.871
We can't wait.

17:21.408 --> 17:22.707
I'm on my way.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.377
-Um, Siobhan?
-Hmm?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.247
Miss Grant will need you
to get her lunch. She wants...

17:29.249 --> 17:31.349
Chef's salad, no ham, no eggs,
no cheese,

17:31.351 --> 17:34.085
boiled chicken, chopped
julienne, with dijon dressing
on the side.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.021
Go. I got it covered.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.091
Thanks.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.460
Just doing your job.
One of us has to.

17:48.535 --> 17:49.801
(Chuckles)

17:51.237 --> 17:52.503
Hey.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.939
(Chuckles) Look what I got.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.942
Oh, the FBI at lord tech...

17:57.944 --> 18:00.111
Lucy: But it's not the FBI.

18:00.113 --> 18:03.181
I had my father run the plates
against the government's black
intelligence network.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.683
That car belongs to
a secret government agency

18:05.685 --> 18:07.652
that tracks aliens.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.455
I bet you they're involved
with Max lord's disappearance.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.390
Well,
i don't think that, um,

18:12.392 --> 18:14.492
(clears throat) Anybody
should know about that.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.462
Why? It's a solid lead.

18:17.464 --> 18:20.765
If you followed up,
you'd probably find out
where Max lord went.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.233
Uh, I just...

18:22.235 --> 18:25.103
I just think it's best
if we don't pursue that

18:26.506 --> 18:27.839
any further.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.141
That doesn't make any sense.
Why would...

18:30.143 --> 18:32.110
We should not
be messing with the deo.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.213
You know about the deo?

18:36.149 --> 18:38.049
No. You just told
me about them.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.484
-No, I didn't.
-Yeah, you did.

18:39.486 --> 18:40.952
You just said,
secret government agency.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.553
But I didn't say
it was the deo.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.988
How do you know...

18:48.194 --> 18:49.260
Supergirl.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.928
(Sighs)

18:50.930 --> 18:54.398
She... she told
you, didn't she?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.335
-Lucy, it's complicated...
-How close are you two?

18:57.337 --> 19:00.271
Are you as close with her
as you are with him?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.508
Closer?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.678
Fool me once, right?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.013
Lucy...

19:09.015 --> 19:10.882
Come on, Lucy, come on.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.558
Based on the human aliases
of our guy's victims,

19:20.560 --> 19:23.694
I think they were actually
these five alien prisoners
from fort rozz.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.563
Any connection
besides fort rozz?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.465
Not that I can see.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.033
All different backgrounds
and crimes.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.668
None of them
were even cellmates.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.803
Alex: The killer
must be picking
them for a reason.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.172
Wait a minute.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.807
Look at that.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.911
See what happens when
you arrange them in the
order that they were killed?

19:39.913 --> 19:41.913
They were all incarcerated
in fort rozz

19:41.915 --> 19:43.047
one after the other.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.849
That's the pattern.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.050
He's killing the
escapees

19:46.052 --> 19:47.451
in their prisoner
number order.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.053
Which would make
the next target...

19:49.055 --> 19:50.354
Prisoner 2445.

19:58.064 --> 20:01.933
Master jailer: <i> Prisoner 2445.</i>

20:02.569 --> 20:04.335
<i> Show yourself.</i>

20:04.337 --> 20:05.236
(Softly) No. No!

20:08.408 --> 20:09.473
Oh!

20:12.078 --> 20:14.478
I thought masks were only
big in that other city.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.415
You gonna tell me who you are?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.118
Guess not.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.191
(Grunting)

20:45.511 --> 20:46.577
Ha!

21:20.980 --> 21:22.246
(Groaning)

21:36.462 --> 21:37.528
(Panting)

21:49.642 --> 21:51.575
Oh, no, no. Just sit.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.746
(Sighs)

21:58.318 --> 22:00.518
Dark night of the soul, huh?

22:01.521 --> 22:02.953
(Chuckles)

22:02.955 --> 22:04.822
No, no. I'm just, uh...

22:05.992 --> 22:07.558
Enjoying the view.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.693
Mmm-hmm.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.095
Is it work?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.563
Is it personal?

22:13.733 --> 22:14.865
Is it both?

22:16.703 --> 22:19.837
-It's a bit of both, actually.
-(Chuckles)

22:19.839 --> 22:21.772
Well, unfortunately,
in our line of work,

22:21.774 --> 22:24.675
we're never doing a good job
unless we let it get personal.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.878
I learned that the hard way
when I was starting out.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.414
Back when you were doing
gossip for the <i> daily planet?</i>

22:30.416 --> 22:32.350
Ahh.

22:32.352 --> 22:36.854
I finally was assigned a story
to write an article about
an up-and-coming actor.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.757
He was charming,
he was gorgeous.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.627
He was married to an actress
who was also gorgeous.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.863
And I interviewed
everyone who knew him

22:45.865 --> 22:48.199
and they all told me
how great he was.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.067
"Lovely."

22:50.069 --> 22:51.502
"Talented."

22:51.504 --> 22:53.637
And then I talked to
the wife's makeup artist,

22:53.639 --> 22:57.675
and she told me all about
the bruises that she had
to cover up every morning.

22:58.444 --> 22:59.810
So, you did the right thing.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.680
You reported the story.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.281
No. I didn't.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.851
I caved.

23:06.853 --> 23:12.490
I caved in to the pressure
from the studio PR hack.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.760
So I wrote a little
puff piece on him.

23:15.762 --> 23:21.732
And, hmm, three months later,
he shot his wife in the head.

23:25.538 --> 23:26.737
(Sighs)

23:30.243 --> 23:31.809
Do you think if you'd...

23:33.112 --> 23:35.780
If you had published
what you knew,

23:35.782 --> 23:38.115
do you think that
you could have
prevented her death?

23:38.117 --> 23:39.483
I think that every day.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.420
See, James,

23:42.422 --> 23:43.954
that's why we do what we do.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.856
That's why we're
driven to tell the truth.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.325
Not only because we want
to be good journalists,

23:48.327 --> 23:51.729
but because we also
want to be good people.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.877
Hank henshaw:
Black star alloy.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.113
That kind of technology,
this guy's definitely
not from around here.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.681
So why is he killing
other aliens?

24:10.683 --> 24:12.416
These victims
aren't just being killed.

24:12.418 --> 24:13.484
They're being executed.

24:13.486 --> 24:16.454
And they're all
from fort rozz.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.156
That professor he just took
seemed harmless enough.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.591
Hank henshaw:
Real name luzano.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.426
Drug smuggler, until
your mother put him away.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.562
Not the week for you
to discuss my family.

24:29.368 --> 24:32.403
I'll start questioning
our fort rozz criminal
alumni again.

24:32.405 --> 24:36.307
Anything we get
we'll cross-reference with the
weapons left at the scene.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.541
Vasquez: Ma'am. Excuse me.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.210
There's someone asking
to see you.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.612
Can we tell Max lord that
I'm not at his Beck and call?

24:41.614 --> 24:43.280
That's not
who wants to see you.

24:48.354 --> 24:49.653
James: <i> When</i>
<i> I'm getting a lesson</i>

24:49.655 --> 24:51.322
in ethics and morality
from cat Grant,

24:51.324 --> 24:53.123
I know we've gone off
the deep end.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.826
Okay, James, I hear you
and I know this is hard,
but it's not about you.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.028
As a journalist,
knowing what I know?

24:58.030 --> 25:00.564
What you know is that
we've caught the most
dangerous man on the planet.

25:00.566 --> 25:03.400
But this is
bigger than one man, Kara.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.469
You're helping them run
a secret Guantanamo here

25:05.471 --> 25:08.205
and it's not just for
aliens anymore.

25:08.207 --> 25:12.009
You're holding
humans and you are
completely unaccountable.

25:13.746 --> 25:16.146
Don't you see this is exactly
why Max lord hates you?

25:16.148 --> 25:20.017
So you think that Max lord
actually has a real
reason to hate me?

25:21.654 --> 25:22.887
No.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.321
I'm sorry, no.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.659
What I mean is,

25:30.129 --> 25:32.396
he's terrified by you.

25:32.398 --> 25:36.166
Because of your ability to do
exactly what you're doing
to him right now.

25:36.168 --> 25:40.170
I mean, you could go in there
and SWAT him dead like a fly
if you wanted to.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.705
I would never do that!

25:41.707 --> 25:43.173
I know that.

25:43.175 --> 25:46.810
But look, when you have
more power than
any human army on earth,

25:46.812 --> 25:48.679
you have to be
better than this.

25:50.550 --> 25:53.350
Kara, it's never gonna
come down to just

25:53.352 --> 25:55.753
a battle of strength,

25:55.755 --> 25:59.590
or smarts, or even
wills with you.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.827
Ultimately, it's going to
be a battle of values.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.931
Yours values versus
your enemy's.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.899
And if you're willing
to abandon those values,

26:08.901 --> 26:10.568
what makes you better
than Max lord?

26:12.038 --> 26:14.338
I mean, is this the kind of
hero that you want to be?

26:14.874 --> 26:16.440
(Chuckles)

26:16.442 --> 26:18.075
I'm the kind of hero
who believes in doing

26:18.077 --> 26:20.110
what needs to be done
to keep the world safe.

26:22.949 --> 26:25.516
Well, the Supergirl
that I know

26:25.518 --> 26:28.419
believes in truth and justice.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.690
Kara, I don't recognize
you like this.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.158
(Scoffs)

26:34.160 --> 26:36.660
That symbol on your chest,

26:36.662 --> 26:39.496
that means something
to a lot of people.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.833
"Stronger together," you said.

26:44.570 --> 26:45.903
But this is not strength.

26:47.540 --> 26:48.806
(Sniffling)

26:50.443 --> 26:53.978
I assume Lucy told
miss Grant about this?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.447
No, Siobhan.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.515
Should look out for her.

26:58.517 --> 26:59.783
(Knock on glass)

27:05.992 --> 27:07.524
-What's his problem?
-Forget it.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.159
What's going on?

27:09.161 --> 27:11.996
We ran diagnostics on
the masked man's
weapon from the attack.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.498
The metal Baton
was standard police issue.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.100
Covered in human DNA.

27:16.102 --> 27:18.602
So, when we ran it through our
database, we got a match.

27:18.604 --> 27:19.837
Detective Warren.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.572
That cop you interviewed
who hates me?

27:21.574 --> 27:23.707
Mmm-hmm, good thing
we know where he works.

27:23.709 --> 27:27.144
Ooh, I've wanted to catch
a corrupt cop ever since
we binge-watched <i> the wire.</i>

27:32.118 --> 27:33.384
Another alien went missing.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.152
Good. We're better off.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.156
Think we'll hear
more from those feds?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.891
They should stick to their
own side of the street.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.726
Leave the real criminals
for us.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.095
What the...

27:48.634 --> 27:49.933
You trying to kill somebody?

27:49.935 --> 27:51.335
Detective Warren?

27:51.337 --> 27:52.603
We need to talk.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.339
What the hell?

27:55.341 --> 27:56.807
Detective draper,
I'm going to need you
to step away.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.175
What do you think
you're doing?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.543
Catching a murderer.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.811
You're out of your mind.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.246
I'm one of the good guys!

28:02.248 --> 28:03.647
He's telling the truth.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.150
-Alex!
-(Alex groaning)

28:07.219 --> 28:08.952
(Panting) No.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.122
(Powering up)

28:12.858 --> 28:13.924
You're him.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.564
(Breathing heavily)

28:20.566 --> 28:22.299
Hank henshaw via radio:
<i> Agent danvers, come in.</i>

28:23.202 --> 28:25.169
I'm here. (Groaning)

28:28.274 --> 28:30.074
We've got an officer down.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.410
Are you all right?

28:33.412 --> 28:34.578
He took Kara.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.016
(Groans)

28:39.018 --> 28:40.284
(Gasping)

28:41.253 --> 28:42.519
(Breathing heavily)

28:43.856 --> 28:45.022
(Grunting)

28:45.024 --> 28:46.990
Ah!

28:46.992 --> 28:48.325
-Luzano: Young lady...
-(Gasps)

28:49.228 --> 28:50.661
I really wouldn't bother.

28:51.297 --> 28:52.563
(Breathing heavily)

28:55.267 --> 28:56.767
If I were to hazard a guess,

28:56.769 --> 28:59.336
I'd say that light mimics
the red sun of Krypton.

28:59.338 --> 29:04.274
And since you derive your
abilities on earth by
exposure to its yellow sun...

29:04.276 --> 29:08.312
As the humans would say,
"we are up a creek
without a poodle."

29:08.914 --> 29:10.047
Paddle.

29:10.049 --> 29:13.117
(Chuckles) Yes, right, paddle.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.385
Why were you in fort rozz?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.490
It doesn't matter now.

29:20.626 --> 29:22.092
Walter under the bridge.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.062
Water.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.264
Yes, of course.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.066
Water.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.105
I was born on star haven.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.373
Do you know it?

29:36.842 --> 29:38.809
Yeah.

29:38.811 --> 29:41.612
Yes, my father took me there
when I was younger.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.381
It was beautiful.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.118
The air smelled like cinnamon.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.188
It did, didn't it?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.391
(Luzano chuckles)

29:54.393 --> 29:59.563
After a strong storm season,
one of my wives fell ill.

29:59.565 --> 30:03.033
The healing expenses
were too much.

30:03.035 --> 30:08.305
And so a simple man entered
the complicated world of
interplanetary drug smuggling.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.176
Caught on my first run.
(Chuckles)

30:12.178 --> 30:15.746
And sentenced by alura Zor-El

30:15.748 --> 30:18.182
to 18 years in fort rozz.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.486
I suppose you hate
my mother, too.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.688
Like all the other escapees.

30:24.690 --> 30:25.823
Luzano: I did.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.826
At first.
But over time, I understood.

30:30.329 --> 30:34.631
One tragedy cannot be undone
by committing another.

30:34.633 --> 30:38.302
So, when I crashed
on earth, I sought only
to lead a good life.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.905
Became a professor.

30:41.907 --> 30:44.374
Taught the one thing
i knew better than anyone
on this planet.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.610
The stars.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.779
My aunt used to teach
me the stars.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.784
I'm going
to get us out of here.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.520
Master jailer: <i> No.</i>

31:01.994 --> 31:05.095
<i> Justice has finally</i>
<i> come for your friend.</i>

31:05.097 --> 31:07.564
<i> Pray it hasn't come</i>
<i> for you, too.</i>

31:07.566 --> 31:09.666
Why don't you lose your mask?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.435
You're not as scary
as you think.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.973
Twelve hours
from the exact time

31:15.975 --> 31:18.508
the last alien was kidnapped
to his time of death.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.344
Which means
she doesn't have long.

31:20.346 --> 31:21.778
Your sister wasn't his target.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.747
Well, maybe that
doesn't mean anything to him.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.183
-We have to find her.
-And we will.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.018
When I promised
Jeremiah danvers

31:28.020 --> 31:30.187
I'd look after his daughters,
i wasn't only talking
about you.

31:32.558 --> 31:36.159
We have a face,
but we still don't
have a match.

31:36.161 --> 31:39.329
Draper's prisoner file
could have been corrupted
in the crash.

31:41.033 --> 31:42.399
Unless...

31:43.102 --> 31:44.801
Unless?

31:44.803 --> 31:46.637
What if draper
wasn't a prisoner?

31:47.773 --> 31:48.906
A guard.

31:51.043 --> 31:54.311
I thought they were all killed
by the prisoners when
fort rozz crashed.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.513
What if one got away?

31:57.082 --> 31:58.348
(Computer beeping)

31:59.451 --> 32:01.184
Hank henshaw:
Draper was a guard.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.220
Originally from
the planet trombus.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.155
Technologically advanced
weapons manufacturers,

32:05.157 --> 32:07.858
which explains
the robocop suit.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.092
His father was a guard.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.494
His grandfather before him.

32:10.496 --> 32:12.129
This job is in his blood.

32:12.131 --> 32:14.831
And still is.
He's trying to re-create
fort rozz here on earth.

32:14.833 --> 32:16.033
With his rules.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.567
Vasquez: Draper's been
jamming his GPS signal

32:17.569 --> 32:19.336
-when he's off duty
-did you unscramble it?

32:19.338 --> 32:21.738
He's been spending time
at a cabin 80 miles
northeast of the city.

32:31.617 --> 32:35.218
I've been watching you,
Kara Zor-El.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.523
Your mother would be proud
you've chosen to follow
in her footsteps.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.392
Delivering punishment
against those who sin.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.528
I'm sorry that's what you
think I've been doing.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.097
We could be colleagues.

32:47.099 --> 32:52.035
Your mother dealt out
true justice against the
scum of our galaxy.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.438
She was a great woman.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.308
Fort rozz was the paradise
of alura's design.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.979
And I'm carrying on
her great work.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.648
All you've done is
dishonor her memory.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.584
What I have done
is protect this city.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.554
This world.

33:10.556 --> 33:15.926
Humans understand
little about justice.

33:15.928 --> 33:18.328
Justice must be absolute.

33:20.733 --> 33:24.468
I'd hoped that you'd see
justice the same way
your mother did.

33:26.271 --> 33:27.704
The way I do.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.743
Prisoner 2445.

33:32.745 --> 33:33.910
(Beeping)

33:33.912 --> 33:35.712
Judgment is upon you.

33:55.901 --> 33:58.735
Trap leader,
this is greyhound.
Give me a sitrep.

33:59.338 --> 34:00.737
Moving in now.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.776
Please, this isn't necessary.
I've never hurt anyone.

34:05.778 --> 34:10.313
Tell that to all the addicts
you were going to supply with
your smuggled narcotics.

34:10.716 --> 34:11.782
Move.

34:11.784 --> 34:12.916
(Grunting)

34:14.253 --> 34:15.385
Down.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.686
Supergirl: (Grunting) No.

34:28.767 --> 34:31.201
Don't do this. Stop! Please.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.370
If you really need to kill
someone, you can kill me.

34:33.372 --> 34:34.704
But don't do this.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.040
I just realized...

34:37.976 --> 34:39.776
I'm gonna have
to kill you, too.

34:42.881 --> 34:43.947
(Powering up)

34:47.453 --> 34:48.952
Alex: Clear the premises.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.663
Deo agent: Clear.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.631
Deo agent 2: Clear.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.302
Hank henshaw via radio:
<i> Alex, what's your status?</i>

35:05.304 --> 35:06.803
Hank, the cabin is empty.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.705
Kara's not here.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.613
Master jailer: <i> Prisoner 2445.</i>

35:16.615 --> 35:19.015
<i> You stand guilty</i>
<i> of drug smuggling.</i>

35:20.018 --> 35:21.418
<i> How do you plead?</i>

35:21.420 --> 35:25.055
I am brave enough to admit
that I am very scared to die.

35:26.892 --> 35:29.526
But I ask that you let her go.

35:29.528 --> 35:32.129
Grant a dying man
his last request.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.097
<i> "Last request?"</i>

35:34.099 --> 35:37.234
<i> That's a human concept.</i>

35:37.236 --> 35:40.837
There has to be some
clue there as to where
draper takes his victims.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.507
There isn't.
There's nothing here.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.817
Give me that crowbar.

35:58.090 --> 35:59.156
(Wood creaking)

36:02.394 --> 36:03.693
His ship.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.495
It's underneath the cabin.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.033
How much c4 do we have?

36:11.036 --> 36:12.068
Supergirl: No. (Panting)

36:12.070 --> 36:14.371
Look at me.
Professor, look at me!

36:14.373 --> 36:16.306
Look at me.
Look at me right here!

36:16.308 --> 36:17.607
(Grunting) Professor!

36:20.212 --> 36:22.279
Master jailer:
<i> Sentence to be carried out.</i>

36:22.281 --> 36:23.580
(Explosion)

36:28.120 --> 36:29.186
Alex: Professor, move!

36:30.389 --> 36:32.122
(Grunting)

36:32.124 --> 36:33.056
-Kara!
-Alex, look out!

36:33.058 --> 36:35.025
-(Master jailer yelling)
-(Groaning)

36:41.066 --> 36:42.465
Red sunlight?

36:42.467 --> 36:43.833
Yeah.

36:44.903 --> 36:45.969
(Grunting)

36:54.913 --> 36:55.979
No!

37:07.459 --> 37:09.259
<i> You wasted your ammo.</i>

37:09.261 --> 37:10.360
No, I didn't.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.928
Here comes the sun.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.029
(Grunting)

37:15.834 --> 37:17.100
Supergirl: Alex, run.

37:27.479 --> 37:28.878
(Supergirl grunting)

37:36.355 --> 37:37.687
It's over.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.391
(Sighs) Sorry I was late.

37:41.393 --> 37:43.093
(Sighs) You were
right on time.

37:43.095 --> 37:44.294
Luzano: Pardon me.

37:44.296 --> 37:47.297
And now, may I ask
what happens to me?

37:51.603 --> 37:52.669
Luzano: Oh.

37:52.671 --> 37:54.638
Whoa. (Chuckles)

37:54.640 --> 37:57.841
I'm quite grateful I did not
acquire the ability to fly
on this planet.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.976
I actually kind of love it.

37:59.978 --> 38:04.281
But I don't understand.
You're letting me go. Why?

38:04.283 --> 38:06.850
Well, you've already
served your time.

38:06.852 --> 38:09.419
And besides,
you have students to teach.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.587
About the stars.

38:10.589 --> 38:12.122
-Thank you, Supergirl.
-Uh, no.

38:12.124 --> 38:12.956
My name is Kara.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.058
Then, thank you, miss Kara.

38:23.535 --> 38:24.834
You're free to go.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.670
(Buttons beeping)

38:31.376 --> 38:32.809
That's unexpected.

38:37.149 --> 38:38.181
Why?

38:38.183 --> 38:40.016
Because it's
the right thing to do.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.118
'Cause she's a better person
than you are.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.219
(Chuckles)

38:44.156 --> 38:45.689
I'm relieved, of course,

38:46.291 --> 38:47.724
but curious.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.660
How do you know
i won't expose you,

38:50.662 --> 38:53.563
the deo and all your
shenanigans to the world
once I exit this place?

38:53.565 --> 38:55.332
I don't.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.834
All I can hope for is that
there's still some part of you

38:57.836 --> 39:00.704
that will listen to
your better angels.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.939
Still harboring hope?
Even for me?

39:04.743 --> 39:06.176
You really are an alien.

39:09.581 --> 39:13.583
If you don't have better
angels, and I suspect
you don't,

39:13.585 --> 39:15.652
you should know that
we've amassed a dossier

39:15.654 --> 39:18.221
the size of this room
documenting your crimes.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.857
Ready for immediate release
to law enforcement.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.227
You tell on us,
we tell on you.

39:24.229 --> 39:25.328
(Chuckles)

39:26.832 --> 39:28.798
Mutually assured destruction.

39:31.269 --> 39:33.937
You're making me nostalgic
for the cold war, Alex.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.374
<i> Do svidanya.</i>

39:38.110 --> 39:39.876
Brrr. (Chuckles)

39:48.754 --> 39:50.019
(Elevator bell dings)

39:51.757 --> 39:53.723
Kara!

39:53.725 --> 39:55.625
Just want you to know,
i did all your work for you
while you were gone.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.460
-I don't think cat even
noticed a difference.
-You know what?

39:57.462 --> 39:59.262
I tried giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

39:59.264 --> 40:03.133
I tried being nice,
but I don't like you.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.702
(Chuckles) I'm not
here to make friends.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.670
I'm here to be
the next cat Grant.

40:07.672 --> 40:09.572
(Scoffs)

40:09.574 --> 40:12.041
I say four months at this
desk, tops, before I'm
a junior reporter.

40:12.043 --> 40:14.911
Get some on-air experience,
make a name for myself.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.813
Once everyone knows me,
I'll build my brand.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.448
Diversify.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.450
In 10 years, people will be
drying themselves using towels

40:20.452 --> 40:22.185
from my luxury
home collection.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.988
And you? You'll be booking
my waxing appointments.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.090
We'll see which one
of us gets to stay.

40:28.393 --> 40:29.692
(Exhales)

40:29.694 --> 40:30.760
-(Knocking on door)
-(Camera clicking)

40:31.663 --> 40:33.396
Hey.

40:33.398 --> 40:38.368
Hey, I just wanna say
thank you for pushing me
to do the right thing.

40:38.370 --> 40:39.836
No. It was a nudge.

40:39.838 --> 40:41.638
You knew what you had to do.

40:41.640 --> 40:43.440
Well, you make me
a better hero.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.176
Well, you make me better, too.

40:49.681 --> 40:50.780
(Sighs)

40:50.782 --> 40:52.282
Something else bothering you?

40:52.851 --> 40:54.951
Yeah. Yeah.

40:56.087 --> 40:58.855
Lucy caught me lying.

40:58.857 --> 41:03.193
And I realized that if I'm
ever gonna make things
work with her,

41:03.195 --> 41:07.030
I need your permission
to stop lying to her.

41:10.535 --> 41:13.136
I need to tell her the truth.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.972
I need to be able
to tell her that
you are Supergirl.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.041
(Sighs)

41:23.715 --> 41:24.981
(Sighs)

41:32.424 --> 41:33.857
Alura: <i> Hello, Kara.</i>

41:33.859 --> 41:35.792
How may I be of assistance?

41:35.794 --> 41:40.129
(Sighs) Today I met one
of the prisoners you
sentenced to fort rozz.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.532
But he was different.

41:43.735 --> 41:47.036
He didn't hate me or you.

41:47.038 --> 41:51.474
I think both of us helped him,
in a weird way.

41:52.577 --> 41:55.945
And that made me feel
close to you again.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.114
And I just wanted
you to know that.

42:04.289 --> 42:08.458
Anyway, uh, I also
have a question about
astra and non.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.627
He mentioned something
the other day.

42:10.629 --> 42:11.761
Myriad?

42:11.763 --> 42:13.296
Warning.

42:13.298 --> 42:16.032
This construct is not
authorized to discuss myriad.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.535
Uh, I don't understand.
What is it?

42:18.537 --> 42:19.769
What is myriad?

42:19.771 --> 42:21.004
-Warning.
-(Alarm blaring)

42:21.006 --> 42:22.672
Continued questioning
about myriad

42:22.674 --> 42:25.542
-will result in this
ai's self-destruction...
-(Tremors)

42:25.544 --> 42:26.609
(Buttons beeping)

42:34.519 --> 42:36.386
(Sighs)

42:36.388 --> 42:39.255
What could be so terrible
that even a hologram
won't discuss it?

42:39.257 --> 42:42.058
Seeing that hologram used
to remind me of my mom.

42:42.928 --> 42:45.028
And now all
i can think of is astra.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.863
And how you killed her.

42:46.865 --> 42:48.665
I'm sorry.
I wish there was another way.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.033
There's always another way.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.137
I need space.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.239
Sure. Take some time off.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.042
Supergirl: (Sighs) No,
that's not what I mean.

42:59.044 --> 43:02.478
I don't know how to work
alongside you anymore.

43:02.480 --> 43:04.414
Maybe one day
that will be different,

43:04.416 --> 43:06.082
but today it's not.
