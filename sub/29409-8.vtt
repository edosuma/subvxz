<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:05.296 --> 00:07.382
- I was planning on
proposing to Casey.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.050
By the time I got there
I realised...

00:10.468 --> 00:12.262
wasn't the right thing to do.

00:12.303 --> 00:14.222
- How about I stay with you
for a while

00:14.264 --> 00:16.683
- As a roommate?
- Yeah.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.268
Then I won't have to stay
with my mom

00:18.309 --> 00:20.395
and her boyfriend
and his crazy daughter.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.397
- (Happy inhale) Up!

00:23.606 --> 00:25.525
(Spartan knickers)

00:25.567 --> 00:28.319
- (Small chuckle)
Hey, boy, you're okay.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.613
We all have are off days.

00:30.655 --> 00:31.740
<i>Tim: What's wrong?</i>
<i>Did he leave?</i>

00:33.408 --> 00:34.909
Doesn't surprise me.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.661
- He left
because I told him to.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.413
- What did he do?
- Nothing.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.831
He did everything right.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.541
- (Sympathetic exhale)

00:41.583 --> 00:43.626
- I think I've just
made a big mistake.

00:43.668 --> 00:47.547

01:22.916 --> 01:24.834
- Caleb, you're whistling again.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.836
What's up with you?

01:26.878 --> 01:28.463
- Oh, maybe it has something
to do with the fact

01:28.505 --> 01:29.714
that I'm gonna be a daddy.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.426
- What?!
- Yeah.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.348
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.433
(Both laugh)

01:40.475 --> 01:41.893
- I hope you're not expecting
a raise?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.395
- Oh, now that you mention it.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.230
Tim, you got company.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.484
- Hey... wow. Heh.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.113
- Hey, Tim.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.825
Case. Yeah.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.996

<i>(Pots clatter)</i>

02:12.632 --> 02:14.175
- What are you doing?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.637
- I'm trying to make us
some of my

02:17.679 --> 02:19.597
world famous blueberry waffles,

02:19.639 --> 02:20.932
but I can't find your waffle
iron anywhere.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.559
- We don't have a waffle iron

02:22.600 --> 02:24.310
- Oh. Okay. Well, that sucks.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.771
(Sighs)

02:26.813 --> 02:28.898
How can you live
without a waffle iron?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.734
You know, Georgie,
I hate to say it

02:30.775 --> 02:32.610
but you really need to start
getting this place in order.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.779
- I need to get this place
in order?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.364
Ever since you moved in here
it's been a disaster.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.532
Look around.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.869
- It's not that bad.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.704
- I had a shower yesterday,
and I went to grab a towel

02:42.746 --> 02:44.789
and all your stinky rodeo
gear was on the rack.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.916
- Okay. You need to chill out,
okay?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.585
Ever since that guy
moved to Florida

02:48.626 --> 02:50.378
you've been in a total mood.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.590
What happened?
- Nothing happened,

02:53.631 --> 02:54.632
and I am not in a mood.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.511
- Okay. Here you go.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.472
- Did you just grab this
out of the sink?

03:00.513 --> 03:02.891
- I wiped it.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.934
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.729
- Must be nice to have
a leisurely breakfast.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.939
- Yes. But I'm so ready
for Ty and Lyndy to come home.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.025
I miss them so much.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.651
And Luke is off at summer camp,

03:13.693 --> 03:14.652
so I kinda feel like
an empty nester.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.488
- I get it...

03:16.529 --> 03:17.989
I got one kid in Vancouver
and one up in the loft.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.783
But you know what?

03:19.824 --> 03:20.867
You gotta just enjoy the
freedom while it lasts, right?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.371
Oh gosh.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.830
There he is again.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.665
- Who's that?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.834
- Uh, hello... J.D. Werth.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.420
He's that wealthy developer
who's running for mayor.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.673
- Right.
Thought I recognized him.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.049
<i>(Door opens)</i>
<i>- Hi, J.D. Werth.</i>

03:36.091 --> 03:38.051
I promise a vote for me

03:38.093 --> 03:39.928
is a vote for progress.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.805
- Uh, excuse me. If you
don't mind my asking.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.640
What exactly does that mean?

03:43.682 --> 03:44.933
What-what kind of progress?

03:44.974 --> 03:47.644
- Well, progress can come
in many forms.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.437
But in general, I think

03:49.479 --> 03:51.314
Hudson could use
a major revitalization.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.191
- Well, I hope that don't mean
a bunch of new developments

03:53.233 --> 03:55.026
that would take away
from our town's charm.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.153
- (Chuckles)
No, no, no. Of course not.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.739
I wanna build on that charm,

03:59.781 --> 04:01.408
with a vision that creates
jobs and opportunities

04:01.449 --> 04:03.493
in the process.
- Hm. Okay.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.120
Well, if you're done
campaigning,

04:05.161 --> 04:06.788
maybe you'd like to order
something off our menu?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.748
- Of course.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.126
Let me see some of those pies
I've heard so much about.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.585
- Sure thing.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.630
(Hooves thunder)

04:19.050 --> 04:21.511
- Well, it's been a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.639
I haven't seen you
around here since uh...

04:26.099 --> 04:27.976
- Since we decided
not to get engaged.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.187
- Right.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.231
- Well, felt like I should keep
my distance.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.442
But I'm back in town
for the Heritage Rodeo.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.860
I'm running it this year.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.903
- Yeah. We're all excited
about it.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.405
Students are getting
ready for it.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.157
- Actually um,

04:42.198 --> 04:43.658
I've got some other news
which is why I came by.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.120
- Wha-what-what's wrong?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.830
- Um...

04:48.872 --> 04:51.041
- What is it?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.834
- Well, I um...
I just got engaged.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.670
I'm getting married.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.633
(Shocked exhale)

05:02.844 --> 05:12.645
**

05:12.687 --> 05:18.735
**

05:18.777 --> 05:22.447
* And at the break of day
you sank into... *

05:23.698 --> 05:25.700
* Your dream *

05:25.742 --> 05:27.577
* You dreamer *

05:27.619 --> 05:29.704
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

05:29.746 --> 05:31.873
* You dreamer *

05:33.917 --> 05:37.879
* You dreamer *

05:43.259 --> 05:44.969
- Married... I-I-I...

05:45.011 --> 05:46.721
(Horse whinnies
in the distance)

05:48.264 --> 05:49.724
I didn't realise you were
seeing somebody.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
- I met Greg on the circuit.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.981
He's a stock contractor
from down south.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.942
- Right.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.194
- We're gonna put some roots
down in New Mexico.

06:01.236 --> 06:03.071
I'm selling my company...

06:04.698 --> 06:06.741
but only to someone
that I trust.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.745
- Why are you looking at me
like that?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.374
- Because I'm hoping
you're interested.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.171
- (Irritated exhale)
Look, he's at it again.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.173
Should I ask him to leave?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.634
- That guy really gets under
your skin, doesn't he?

06:24.676 --> 06:26.302
- Well, his whole platform
is about change.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.846
You know, changing our town.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.017
Why? I mean, what's wrong
with Hudson the way it is?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.852
- Yeah, but doesn't every
politician talk about

06:33.893 --> 06:35.895
how they're gonna be the big
change-maker?

06:35.937 --> 06:37.772
It's just talk, Lou?
- I don't know.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.315
There's something about
this guy

06:39.357 --> 06:40.608
tells me not
to underestimate him.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.570
- Thanks for the pie, Lou.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.363
You really do run
a great place here.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.907
You know, it's forward thinking
entrepreneurs like you

06:47.949 --> 06:50.035
that are part of my vision
for tomorrow's Hudson.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.245
- Great.
- Oh.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.039
(Button rattles)
There you go.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.960
<i>Thanks again.</i>
<i>(Door opens)</i>

07:00.879 --> 07:02.088
- Have you seen Lisa's new
jumpers?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.882
They're beautiful.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.175
She said we can take them
for a ride

07:05.216 --> 07:06.801
on her cross-country course.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.095
- Yeah. I would be
totally up for that.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.473
- Does anyone know anything
about J.D. Werth?

07:13.058 --> 07:15.101
He owns Werth Developments.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.936
- Yeah. His banners are up
at all the rodeos.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.730
He's a huge sponsor.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.190
- And he's running for Mayor.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.232
But it doesn't seem like
he's got much competition.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.234
- Right?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.195
- Now we don't talk politics
at the table.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.821
- Well, maybe we should start.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.323
The election is only
a month away.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.658
- So, guess who stopped by
the practice

07:30.700 --> 07:32.577
to talk to me today?
Casey.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.080
- Casey?
- Really?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.956
- When did she get back
in town?

07:36.998 --> 07:37.832
- She's running
the Heritage Rodeo.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.920
But get this... she's uh...

07:41.961 --> 07:44.631
she's engaged.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.758
- Huh.
- To someone else?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.343
- Yes, Georgie.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.220
- Well, who is it?

07:50.261 --> 07:52.055
- It's a guy.

07:52.097 --> 07:55.892
He's a stock contractor
from Albuquerque.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.852
She's gonna move down there
and she's...

07:57.894 --> 08:00.647
she's gonna be married
to him.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.816
- That must be a little weird
for you.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.901
- No, no. I mean...

08:04.943 --> 08:06.736
you know what's really weird?

08:06.778 --> 08:08.113
She tried to sell me
her company.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.031
- Hm.

08:10.073 --> 08:12.200
Well, running rodeos kinda
sounds right up your alley.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.035
- Yeah, I think you'd be really
good at that.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.745
- You could use the money you
got from selling Big River--

08:15.787 --> 08:18.248
- Whoa, whoa,no. No-no.
I'm not buy it.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.500
I've got a rodeo business,
and it can't run itself.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.085
- Well, Caleb could step up
and do a little bit more.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.795
- Yeah.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.463
- Like I said,
it can't run itself.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.132
(Jack chuckles)
Amy: Dad...

08:27.173 --> 08:28.967
are you sure you're not
just bitter?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.969
- Uh, no.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.179
I'm happy...

08:34.222 --> 08:35.849
for her and, you know,
the guy.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.183
You know?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.520
It's just, that's
it's not my problem

08:40.562 --> 08:43.231
that she's trying to dump
her business on me.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.401
So she can run off
and get married...

08:46.443 --> 08:48.319
to some guy...

08:48.361 --> 08:50.280
in Albuquerque.

**

08:59.873 --> 09:01.833
(Door opens and shuts)

09:03.126 --> 09:04.919
(Truck rumbles up)

09:10.717 --> 09:11.968
- Good mornin'.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.845
- Hi.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.138
- So you gonna take over
my company or what?

09:15.180 --> 09:17.015
- (Sighs)

09:17.057 --> 09:19.809
Case, I...

09:19.851 --> 09:21.936
I appreciate you asking me,
I really do.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.357
I have my rodeo school.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.317
I'm just too busy right now.
I can't.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.027
- Come on, you've been doing
that for a long time.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.779
Not ready for a new challenge?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.989
- What's with the hard sell?

09:33.031 --> 09:35.283
- Because you're the right
person for this.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.035
I don't wanna hand it off
to just anybody.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.041
I hope this isn't about me
getting married.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.001
- No.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.878
- Because it doesn't matter.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.922
This is strictly business.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.007
And I know you're the type
of guy

09:51.049 --> 09:52.258
who recognizes a good deal
when you see it so...

09:53.468 --> 09:55.845
just take a look.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.472
My company's financials.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.932
And that's last year's
bottom line.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.688
- (Impressed exhale)

10:04.729 --> 10:06.439
Oh!

10:06.481 --> 10:08.024
- Oh yeah, one more thing -

10:08.066 --> 10:10.068
Lee's finally framing
our house.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.945
- That's good. Your dad must
have been on him then?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.030
- Actually no.
He's been pretty tied up

10:14.072 --> 10:16.032
getting his students ready
for a big rodeo.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.410
- Oh! Well, that's probably
why Lee's made some progress.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.037
- Yeah, maybe.
Okay, well, I should run,

10:21.079 --> 10:22.956
but Lyndy you say hi
to grandma for me, okay?

10:22.997 --> 10:25.208
- Bye.
- (Ty chuckles)

10:25.250 --> 10:26.960
My mom wishes you were here.
We're all miss you.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.503
- Yeah, I miss you too.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.213
You guys hurry home.
- We will.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.840
Love you.
- Love you too.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.216
Bye Lyndy. Love you.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.801
- Say bye.
- Bye.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.803
- Bye.
(Small laugh)

10:36.845 --> 10:38.513
(Screen door shuts)
- Okay!

10:38.555 --> 10:40.223
I'm doing it.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.933
I'm getting into
the rodeo business.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.518
- You already in the rodeo
business.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.103
- No, I mean I'm buying
Casey's company.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.022
- Congrats, Dad!
That's awesome!

10:47.063 --> 10:48.857
- You were dead set
against that last night.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.275
What happened?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.193
- I got a look at the profit
margin.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.404
And you were right, I'm already
in the rodeo business.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.698
So it's not like I'm starting
from scratch.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.867
- So does this mean a bigger
role for Caleb in the school?

10:58.908 --> 11:00.660
- Ah... I'm not sure.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.329
Look, first I'm gonna focus
on this heritage rodeo.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.998
Casey and I are gonna do it
together.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.416
Just like a transition.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.168
- Well, that makes sense.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.377
Give you a chance
to get your feet wet--

11:09.419 --> 11:11.004
- No, no.
We're diving right in.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.922
And we're gonna need some help.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.466
You know,
we gotta make a splash!

11:14.507 --> 11:16.301
- We?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.927
- Well, you're the one
that pushed me into this.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.387
So I'm gonna need your help
on this, Jack.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.097
- No.
- Look,

11:21.139 --> 11:22.766
here is what I wanna do.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.601
I wanna do a little ceremony
at the beginning that honours

11:24.642 --> 11:26.561
some of the Hall of Famers
from back in the day.

11:26.603 --> 11:28.271
- Yeah, yeah, I-I'll be there.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.273
- No. But I mean from way back.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.400
Like further than you even.
Before electricity.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.985
<i>So I've got a list.</i>

11:34.027 --> 11:36.279
I need you to be my point man.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.531
Maybe you can contact
the folks on that.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.533
- Oh yeah, there is some
familiar names there.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.244
It might be fun to catch up.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.789
Look at that,
"Lucky" Butch Connelly.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.917
I haven't seen him in a long
while. Sure I'll help you out.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.543
- Okay, great.
I'll let you get at it.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.087
I'm a busy man.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.964
This will be good.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.883
- (Chuckles)

11:56.925 --> 11:58.802
"Lucky" Butch Connelly.

11:58.843 --> 12:07.894
**

12:07.936 --> 12:10.021
- (Sighs)

12:10.063 --> 12:11.064
That's my lunch!

12:12.565 --> 12:14.609
- Sorry. Want the rest?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.403
- No. It's okay.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.113
Someone's in a mood again.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.531
- I just took an ice cold
shower, Jade.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.574
I couldn't even wash my hair.
- Okay, well,

12:21.616 --> 12:23.618
I think we have the world's
smallest hot water tank

12:23.660 --> 12:25.286
- Or maybe you take
the world's longest showers?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.457
- Okay. Why don't we talk about
what's really bothering you.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.751
- I am. I have a roommate that
doesn't clean up after herself,

12:31.793 --> 12:34.504
steals all my food,
and hogs all the hot water.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.590
- Okay. I think this rant
has a lot more to do with Quinn

12:37.632 --> 12:39.968
than it does with me.
- Jade! Stop!

12:40.010 --> 12:41.594
- Okay.
- Whoa.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.596
Sorry am I inputting something?

12:43.638 --> 12:45.181
- Georgie is just seriously
repressing.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.350
- Not true.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.352
- Okay, well whatever's
going on it sounds like

12:49.394 --> 12:51.354
you guys could probably use
a break from each other.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.606
Georgie I was thinking
maybe we could go Fairfield,

12:53.648 --> 12:55.984
and try out Lisa's new
jumpers?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.569
- Um, thanks,
but not-not today.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.529
- Okay. Jade?

12:59.571 --> 13:02.365
- Me? On a jumper?
- Yeah. Why not?

13:02.407 --> 13:03.658
- Could be pretty hard
for her to handle.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.077
- Okay. I do rodeo
for a living,

13:06.119 --> 13:08.163
I think I can handle
a jumping horse.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.581
- Yeah. But you can't jump
anything, so what's the point?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.166
- I bet I could ride
a jumping horse

13:11.207 --> 13:12.751
better than you can ride
broncs.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.419
- Ooh, that sounds to me like
a challenge?

13:14.461 --> 13:16.171
- Yeah, I'm in if you are--
- Yeah. You're on.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.505
- Whoa-whoa-whoa. You are not
getting on a bronc.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.341
But maybe a friendly competition

13:19.382 --> 13:20.675
would be good for you guys
- Sure.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.677
I still think I can jump
a horse

13:22.719 --> 13:24.012
better than she can rope
a calf.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.097
- Game on.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.099
<i>Amy: They both got so amped up.</i>

13:28.141 --> 13:30.393
But it's crazy, right?
- What? No.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.187
I think it's actually
a really good idea

13:32.228 --> 13:34.189
that dad buys Casey's
rodeo business.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.690
- You are not even listening
to me.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.901
I'm talking about Georgie
and Jade.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.444
- I'm sorry.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.571
I'm just doing a little
digging on J.D. Werth.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.448
- I think you're maybe getting

13:43.490 --> 13:45.325
a little too involved in this,
Lou.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.743
- Well, if he's gonna be
our next mayor

13:46.785 --> 13:48.536
I wanna know
what we're getting.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.122
So far I've found some pretty
shady business practices,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.375
and this kind of scary quote
from a town hall meeting.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.126
- What does it say?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.170
- "Growth and comfort
can't coexist

13:57.212 --> 13:59.506
and Hudson has become
far too comfortable."

13:59.547 --> 14:01.633
- Well, at least him message
stays consistent.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.635
He's all about change.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.428
- Yeah. And everybody
is getting on board.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.430
He's way ahead in the polls.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.474
But how far is he gonna go
with these big ideas?

14:09.516 --> 14:11.726
And what are these big ideas
anyways?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.395
He never really says.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.272
I don't trust him.

14:16.314 --> 14:24.280
**

14:24.322 --> 14:26.366
(Leaves rustle in the wind)

14:26.408 --> 14:28.118
- Right here?
- Okay.

14:28.159 --> 14:33.498
**

14:33.540 --> 14:36.292
(Tires crunch, brakes squeak)

14:36.334 --> 14:38.128
(Engine rumbles)

14:38.169 --> 14:44.426
**

14:44.467 --> 14:46.261
(Knocking)

14:55.228 --> 14:57.272
- Yeah?

14:57.313 --> 14:59.399
- Hello Lucky!
Long time no see.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.527
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.446
- Yeah, it's me. Jack...

15:05.822 --> 15:08.241
Jack Bartlett.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.951
- Well, I'll be damned!

15:11.411 --> 15:13.371
(Laughing)

15:13.413 --> 15:14.414
- Whoa, Butch...
(Falling thud)

15:14.456 --> 15:16.499
(Pained grunts)

15:16.541 --> 15:18.293
- I got you.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.420
- I get-I get a little dizzy
sometimes.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.630
- Oh, Butch. Not again.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.133
I'll get the peas.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.719
- Oh... hey...
- (Laughing)

15:27.761 --> 15:29.637
Kinda funny - I used to be
able to

15:29.679 --> 15:33.641
stay on a thousand pounds
(pained groan) of nasty.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.311
Now I can't even stand
on my own two feet.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.565
(Exhales)
Old age, huh?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.234
Nasty son of a gun, ain't he?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.527
Well, I guess you didn't come
all the way out here

15:44.569 --> 15:46.863
to listen to me blather on.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.740
- Truth be told I'm...

15:48.782 --> 15:51.201
I'm here on official business.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.411
I'm recruiting some local
legends

15:53.453 --> 15:55.580
to be a part of the Heritage
Rodeo.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.290
- You must be kinda short
of entries.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.459
(Chuckles)

15:59.501 --> 16:02.420
- I'm pretty sure you can
still hold your own.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.340
But I'm talking about
a little ceremony here.

16:05.382 --> 16:09.594
- Oh, you're gonna check out
the old relics, are you?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.596
- (Jack chuckles)
- Sure, sure.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.598
I-I'll-I'll come out.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.559
I just showed Maureen
the other day,

16:16.601 --> 16:19.312
the scrapbook of my old
rodeo articles. Hm.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.357
Yeah.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.692
I-I'll be right back.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.485
- Take it slow.
- No, I know.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.195
I'm just gotta find Jack
the book, eh?

16:31.908 --> 16:33.743
- Is he okay?

16:33.785 --> 16:35.370
- Depends on the day.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.374
It's been a rough couple
of years.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.878
Memory lapses,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.964
dizzy spells.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.050
Doctor thinks it's because
of the concussions.

16:49.092 --> 16:51.720
- Well, they didn't exactly use
the best safety gear back then.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.555
If any at all.
- Yeah.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.142
Well, he's paying for it now...

16:57.183 --> 16:59.561
so am I.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.147
I'm the one who has to take
care of him, and this place.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.567
As you can see I'm not doing
a very good job of either.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.320
- Well, that's a lot on you,
Maureen.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.574
There's no shame
in getting some help.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.827
- It's not a matter of pride,
trust me.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.622
We don't have any money.
There's only so much

17:19.664 --> 17:21.958
you can get out of
the healthcare system,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.544
and the rodeo didn't come
with a pension.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.965
<i>- Maureen... what was I</i>
<i>supposed to get for you again?</i>

17:29.007 --> 17:31.426
- It's okay, honey.

17:31.468 --> 17:35.055
I'm gonna come in
and make us some lunch.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.394
I'm not sure
about this weekend.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.813
I'll let you know
how he's doing.

17:43.855 --> 17:51.196
**

17:57.452 --> 17:59.079
- Hey, Grandpa.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.373
Any luck tracking down
the old timers?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.541
- Oh yeah. There seems to be
a lot of interest

18:03.583 --> 18:05.293
in being a part of it.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.754
- That's good.
- But I gotta say...

18:07.796 --> 18:10.215
it has certainly opened
my eyes.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.966
- How so?

18:12.008 --> 18:15.595
- Well, some of them have
hit pretty hard times.

18:15.637 --> 18:18.431
My old friend, Butch,
he's really struggling.

18:18.473 --> 18:21.601
The long term effects
from too many concussions.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.603
- I'm sorry to hear that.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.606
- And the worst of it is he
doesn't have enough money

18:26.648 --> 18:28.775
to pay for the extra healthcare

18:28.817 --> 18:30.610
and support that he needs.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.404
- That doesn't seem fair.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.572
- No, it is not.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.825
Butch and these other legends,

18:36.866 --> 18:38.702
they're the ones who gave
the best years of their lives

18:38.743 --> 18:41.162
to make the rodeo
what it is today.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.750
When they used to get thrown
from a bronc or a bull,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.877
there was a pickup man
to pull them off the ground.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.672
And now when they
need it most...

18:50.714 --> 18:52.716
who have they got?

18:52.757 --> 18:55.844
No. They're completely
on their own,

18:55.885 --> 18:57.846
and something's gotta change.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.560
- An English saddle feels
different, doesn't it?

19:03.601 --> 19:06.021
- It's smaller.
- Yeah.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.732
Just remember balance is the
most important thing, okay?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.734
Keep your shoulders
in line with your hips -

19:10.775 --> 19:12.610
in line with your heels.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.737
Caleb: Keep your elbow up
nice and high.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.822
- Okay.
- You gonna pull.

19:15.864 --> 19:16.906
- Pull.
- Pull? Don't push.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.242
Don't push, pull.
- Okay.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.785
<i>- Swing the tip of your rope</i>
<i>at the calf's neck.</i>

19:22.537 --> 19:24.539
<i>Amy: one, two, three, four.</i>
<i>Up!</i>

19:24.581 --> 19:26.374
There you go.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.835
(Rope whooshes)
- Oh!

19:28.877 --> 19:30.628
- That was a good start.
- Sorry, Caleb.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.380
- Wrong dummy but that
was pretty good.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.882
- (Laughing)
- That's pretty good.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.676
- You wanna lean forward.
Look beyond the jump.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.803
- (Gasps)
- Yeah!

19:38.845 --> 19:40.930
- Oh my gosh!

19:40.972 --> 19:43.600
<i>Amy: That's it.</i>
<i>Caleb: Elbow up.</i>

19:43.641 --> 19:45.894
<i>Start rolling your hand over.</i>

19:45.935 --> 19:47.771
(Rope whooshes)
Lower you wrist.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.023
Okay, yes!
You're getting there.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.775
- Kind of.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.610
- Ah, you're kinda getting
there.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.904
- Get into your two point.
There you go.

19:55.945 --> 20:02.702
**

20:02.744 --> 20:04.788
<i>Caleb: Almost! Try again!</i>

20:04.829 --> 20:06.873
- What in the heck
is this about?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.588
(Door shuts, tired exhale)

20:13.630 --> 20:15.965
Hey. You see what's going on
out there?

20:16.007 --> 20:18.551
- You said you'd be here
an hour ago.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.762
- Well, I'm swamped with stuff
for this rodeo, right now.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.473
I mean, I gotta find (sighs)

20:23.515 --> 20:26.351
I gotta find stock
and concessions.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.186
And I gotta find rodeo clowns,

20:28.228 --> 20:29.729
and I gotta find somebody
to sing the national anthem.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.272
How-how's it going
with the old boys?

20:31.314 --> 20:33.817
- Well, I've been able
to track down quite a few,

20:33.858 --> 20:35.735
but the way most of them
are living...

20:35.777 --> 20:38.488
it's not right.
- What do you mean?

20:38.530 --> 20:40.740
- This sport of ours
it's tough on the body.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.826
It doesn't make for,
you know,

20:42.867 --> 20:44.828
the most comfortable
retirement years.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.746
- Well, nature of the beast.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.164
- Well, it just seems to me
that...

20:48.206 --> 20:50.125
I don't know,
an accounting firm

20:50.166 --> 20:52.502
can have a pension plan
for their bean counters,

20:52.544 --> 20:54.838
but there's absolutely
nothing in place

20:54.879 --> 20:56.840
for people that ride broncs
and bulls for a living.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.675
- So are you saying,

20:58.717 --> 21:00.635
you would've rather been
an accountant?

21:00.677 --> 21:03.013
- What I'm saying is,
it is not fair,

21:03.054 --> 21:04.806
and maybe we can do
something about it.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.224
- What do you mean?

21:06.266 --> 21:08.727
- We could start up
some kind of foundation.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.937
Offer these old timers
a little financial support.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.773
(Phone rings)
- Well, that-that's not a bad
idea.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.734
Not sure where the money
would come from.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.193
- Well, this is
what I'm thinking.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.779
- I gotta take this.
- I'm not done here.

21:19.821 --> 21:21.573
- Well, Jack,
look, we'll talk more...

21:21.614 --> 21:23.408
after the rodeo, okay?
Just a sec.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.035
(Beeps phone on)
Barry, yeah.

21:25.076 --> 21:25.994
No, north side of the arena.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.495
Yeah.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.458
Okay. Ah, just give me
a second, I'll get it.

21:31.499 --> 21:32.667
- (Sighs)

21:34.127 --> 21:35.754
- You good to go?

21:35.795 --> 21:37.339
- Yeah.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.967
(Calf moos)
- On your way.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.512
Now that's it, stay with him!

21:44.554 --> 21:46.181
(Calf moos)

21:46.222 --> 21:48.850
(Hooves thunder)

21:48.892 --> 21:50.143
<i>Okay, stop your horse!</i>

21:50.185 --> 21:51.770
(Laughs) Yeah! Woo!

21:51.811 --> 21:53.646
- Go Georgie!

21:53.688 --> 21:55.648
- I did it!
- Seriously?

21:55.690 --> 21:57.525
That was a fluke.
(Mooing)

21:58.735 --> 22:00.653
(Car door opens)

22:00.695 --> 22:02.238
- Hey, look what I got.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.240
(Door shuts)
All my old articles.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.785
A bunch of pictures too.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
- Oh Yeah? Is there anything
about me in there?

22:08.870 --> 22:10.789
- No, I don't think so.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.040
Most of the articles
are about the winners.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.337
(Both laughing)

22:19.172 --> 22:21.216
Here, check this out.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.718
That's why they called me
"lucky".

22:23.760 --> 22:26.721
Yeah. Somehow I managed to
always to get back up again.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.142
- Butch, you ever wonder
if it was all worth it?

22:31.184 --> 22:34.104
- I've had my moments.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.524
But even with all the aches
and pains...

22:37.565 --> 22:39.567
and everything else.

22:41.611 --> 22:43.947
If I co-if I could go back...
hey, I'd do it...

22:43.988 --> 22:46.199
all over again.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.576
It's what I was born to do.
- Yeah.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.996
It just feels like
there shoulda been

22:52.038 --> 22:54.040
some kind of safety net
when it was all over.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.126
- Yeah.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.585
- It's not like we really knew
what we were getting into.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.880
We were all so young.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.716
- I thought we were invincible.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.092
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

23:05.760 --> 23:07.846
- I've been thinking...

23:07.887 --> 23:10.015
about a fund for retired
rodeo vets.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.810
- That's a good idea.

23:13.852 --> 23:16.813
But where you gonna get
that money, hm?

23:16.855 --> 23:18.690
Everybody always wants
to put their money

23:18.732 --> 23:21.901
into bigger, better,
flashier rodeos.

23:21.943 --> 23:24.154
- This is where it all started.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.823
There wouldn't have sold-out
rodeo arenas

23:26.865 --> 23:28.616
if it wasn't for people
like you.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.120
And they say they wanna honour
our heritage...

23:32.162 --> 23:35.081
but it seems like everyone

23:35.123 --> 23:36.916
is just turning their backs
on it to me.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.002
- Yeah.

23:39.044 --> 23:40.795
Well, it does sort of seem
like that, doesn't it?

23:42.380 --> 23:44.841
But what you gonna do?

23:44.883 --> 23:46.634
- Well, we can't sit back

23:46.676 --> 23:48.303
and wait for something
to change.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.680
I think it's time to take
the bull by the horns.

23:57.562 --> 24:03.735

24:03.777 --> 24:05.111
(Door opens and shuts)

24:07.864 --> 24:09.741
- Hey.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.326
Uh, do you want me to make you
some breakfast or something?

24:11.368 --> 24:12.952
- I'm not hungry.
I'm just here to let Amy know

24:12.994 --> 24:14.913
that we're ready to go
to Fairfield.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.081
- Yeah. Yeah. She told me about
this little competition.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.874
Sounds like fun.

24:17.916 --> 24:20.919
And a good distraction
from stuff.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.879
- Mom. I'm fine.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.714
- I just, I know how hard
it is, okay?

24:24.756 --> 24:26.800
The first time you
really fall for a guy,

24:26.841 --> 24:28.843
and it's not an easy thing
to get over.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.261
- I said I'm fine.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.097
And I'm the one who broke it
off with him so.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.723
(Approaching steps thud)
We're ready.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.058
- Okay, great.
Let's see what Jade's got.

24:35.100 --> 24:36.935
- Have fun.

24:36.976 --> 24:40.313
- Um, what's that?
- Uh, no, you know, what?

24:40.355 --> 24:42.315
This is-it's nothing.
- No, no, no.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.359
It looks to me like an
application to run for mayor.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.236
- Jade is all over me
about entering this race.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.987
So she sent me the link,
but it's--

24:48.029 --> 24:50.115
- So are you thinking
about running?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.117
- No. That...

24:52.158 --> 24:54.077
that would be crazy.
- No, not that crazy.

24:54.119 --> 24:56.746
- Seriously?

24:56.788 --> 24:58.123
- Seriously, I think
you would be good at it?

24:58.164 --> 25:00.208
- I think so too.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.835
But aren't you looking for
some vacation time with Mitch.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.253
Isn't that why you bought
that property?

25:03.294 --> 25:05.422
- Exactly.
And, you know,

25:05.463 --> 25:07.465
I've got way too much on my
plate already as it is so...

25:07.507 --> 25:09.968
<i>Amy: Yeah.</i>
<i>Yeah, you're right.</i>

25:10.010 --> 25:12.804
Well, it looks like J.D. Werth
is gonna be our next mayor.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.222
Let's just hope
he not as bad for Hudson

25:14.264 --> 25:15.932
as you think he'll be.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.447
<i>Quinn: Oh, come on.</i>

25:30.488 --> 25:32.240
How can you look at Lisa's
brand new cross-country course

25:32.282 --> 25:34.075
and not wanna jump it?

25:34.117 --> 25:35.994
(Hooves thud)

25:36.036 --> 25:37.579
<i>Amy: You ready?</i>

25:39.539 --> 25:42.000
- Yeah. You picked Atlas?
Good choice.

25:42.042 --> 25:45.253
- All tight.
Well, let's get started.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.297
Just stay nice and relaxed.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.257
Georgie you can go first
and then Jade can follow you.

25:49.299 --> 25:50.842
- Um, actually I'm not
gonna jump today.

25:50.884 --> 25:52.969
- What?

25:53.011 --> 25:55.055
- I just feel like watching.

25:55.096 --> 25:56.473
Good luck though...
you'll need it.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.224
- Don't worry. Me and Atlas
are gonna rock this.

25:58.266 --> 26:09.736

26:09.778 --> 26:12.197
Amy: Eyes up. Heels down.

You've got this.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.867
Nice!

26:15.909 --> 26:17.952
- I did it!
- That was great, Jade.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.080

26:20.121 --> 26:21.915
<i>- Did you see that!</i>

26:21.956 --> 26:23.458

26:25.293 --> 26:28.338
<i>(Spartan whinnies)</i>

Ho.

- (Concerned exhale)

26:34.511 --> 26:36.096
- Is he okay?
- Oh no. What happened?

26:36.137 --> 26:37.972
- He just pulled up lame.

26:39.933 --> 26:42.769
(Velcro ripping sound)

26:42.811 --> 26:44.896
- Hey.
- (Phone chimes)

26:44.938 --> 26:47.232
We need to talk
about this fund.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.401
- Jack, I got a million things
on my plate.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.319
I already told you
that I don't have time.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.905
- Well, if you wanna do this
ceremony with the legends,

26:53.947 --> 26:55.865
you're gonna have to make
some time.

26:55.907 --> 26:57.575
- Seriously?

26:57.617 --> 26:59.411
I'm in the middle of planning
my first rodeo.

26:59.452 --> 27:02.247
What do you want from me?
- Well, it's not just you.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.291
I'm talking to all the other
rodeo business people too.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.253
If fact we're gonna meet
in the grandstand here

27:08.294 --> 27:10.380
in about half an hour.
(Phone ringing)

27:10.422 --> 27:12.674
Well, you go ahead,
you take that call.

27:12.716 --> 27:15.010
I'll see you with everybody
else right over here,

27:15.051 --> 27:17.303
half hour.

27:17.345 --> 27:20.015
- What are you up to?
- Just be there.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.228
(Spartan snorts)

27:25.270 --> 27:27.272
- What did Cass say?

27:27.313 --> 27:29.607
- He strained his suspensory
ligament.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.944
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Yeah. I think so.

27:32.986 --> 27:35.196
He just over exerted himself.

27:35.238 --> 27:37.782
Cassandra said that he should
heal up pretty quickly.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.201
Hey...

27:41.494 --> 27:43.371
- I'm really sorry he got hurt.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.081
- It was all because of our
stupid competition.

27:45.123 --> 27:47.375
- No, this is nobody's fault.
Okay?

27:47.417 --> 27:49.627
Spartan's not as young
as he used to be.

27:49.669 --> 27:52.047
I probably have to start being
a bit more careful with him.

27:58.053 --> 28:00.889
- Hey. Couple lunch specials
from the diner.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.016
- Sweet. What's that?

28:04.309 --> 28:06.269
- This is uh...

28:06.311 --> 28:09.105
I went by J.D. Werth's
campaign office today.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.690
- What?
- Yeah.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.525
I just wanted to talk to him,
you know,

28:12.567 --> 28:15.153
and find out what he actually
has in mind for Hudson.

28:15.195 --> 28:17.197
And so I'm waiting
in his office, forever,

28:17.238 --> 28:18.823
and I see this.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.410
And it's labeled
"Tomorrow's Hudson".

28:24.079 --> 28:26.664
- And you took it?
- (Exhales) I know.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.541
You know what,
I shouldn't have.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.293
And I'm gonna definitely
return this right now.

28:30.335 --> 28:32.295
- No, no. We need
to look inside.

28:32.337 --> 28:35.048
- We should not be looking
at that.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.508
- Why? You took it.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.263
<i>Georgie: Whoa, what is this?</i>

28:44.349 --> 28:46.393
- This is main street...

28:46.434 --> 28:49.062
<i>a really commercialized</i>
<i>version of it.</i>

28:49.104 --> 28:51.439
<i>Jade: And he wants to put this</i>
<i>cheesy chain restaurant</i>

28:51.481 --> 28:53.358
<i>right next to Maggie's?</i>

28:53.400 --> 28:54.984
- Looks like that's the plan.

28:55.026 --> 28:57.404
**

28:59.114 --> 29:01.157
- You see...

29:01.199 --> 29:04.577
it's just not right to see
the pioneers of our sport

29:04.619 --> 29:07.497
in such dire strait.
- Mhmm.

29:07.539 --> 29:10.208
- Especially when we can all
band together to help them out.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.585
So what I'd like to propose...

29:12.627 --> 29:16.548
is that each of you
donate a small percentage

29:16.589 --> 29:18.591
of your rodeo companies profits

29:18.633 --> 29:20.885
into a retirement fund.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.178
What do you say?

29:22.220 --> 29:24.305
(Hesitant reactions)

29:25.849 --> 29:27.475
- Look, I-I maybe the new kid
on the block here,

29:29.394 --> 29:31.271
but I think I speak
for everyone when I...

29:32.814 --> 29:34.941
well... when I say that
we all understand

29:34.983 --> 29:35.984
these people need our help.

29:38.236 --> 29:39.654
But, personally,
I haven't even had a chance

29:39.696 --> 29:41.156
to prove my books.

29:41.197 --> 29:43.366
So I don't know
what I can contribute.

29:43.408 --> 29:44.951
- Well, I can help you out
with that.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.995
- Well, thanks.

29:47.037 --> 29:49.289
But there's also no precedent.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.416
So I think in fairness,

29:51.458 --> 29:53.668
we should all just
take some time,

29:53.710 --> 29:55.337
give it some proper thought.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.921
And then, you know,
we'll talk about it again.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.131
- Talk is cheap.

29:59.674 --> 30:02.344
But being old
and broken down isn't.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.972
I shouldn't have to say this,

30:06.014 --> 30:07.515
but apparently I do.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.019
If we,
as the rodeo community,

30:12.437 --> 30:15.231
don't support and protect
the men and women

30:15.273 --> 30:17.192
who built this thing...
who will?

30:17.233 --> 30:18.526
So I'll ask again;

30:20.403 --> 30:22.197
Who's gonna step up?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.077
<i>Seriously?</i>

30:27.118 --> 30:29.829
Seriously?!

30:29.871 --> 30:33.124
So, what? You expect these
legends to show up

30:33.166 --> 30:35.627
for some token ceremony,

30:35.669 --> 30:38.672
and help you all look humble
and grateful.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.715
You're not even willing
to help?!

30:40.757 --> 30:42.884
Provide them with a decent
quality of life?

30:44.386 --> 30:46.221
Well, too bad.
'Cause they're not coming.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.517
The legends of our sport
are officially boycotting

30:50.558 --> 30:52.227
The Heritage Rodeo.

30:52.268 --> 30:57.190

31:20.630 --> 31:22.465
- How are you?

31:22.507 --> 31:24.300
Oh. Hey there, Lou.

31:24.342 --> 31:26.386
I heard you came by
to see me yesterday.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.221
- Yeah. Yeah, there is just,
you know,

31:28.263 --> 31:30.515
only so long I could sit
around and wait.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.350
- Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

31:32.392 --> 31:33.351
I mean, let's-let's get
something in the books

31:33.393 --> 31:35.478
for next week.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.272
Looks like I'm freed up from
hitting that campaign trail.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.523
- Ah... aren't you
in the final stretch

31:38.565 --> 31:40.692
before the big election?

31:40.734 --> 31:42.485
- It appears not.

31:42.527 --> 31:43.653
My only opponent dropped out
of the race.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.363
I'm gonna announce myself
as the new mayor,

31:45.405 --> 31:46.656
right here, today.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.700
- Wait, you can't do
that though.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.660
It has to go through
town council.

31:50.702 --> 31:52.537
- Well, my friends on council
say it's just a formality.

31:52.579 --> 31:54.247
I'm the last man standing.

31:54.289 --> 31:55.498
It's a done deal.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.292
(Laughs)

32:01.421 --> 32:02.547
<i>Announcer: Get into your seats,</i>
<i>folks,</i>

32:02.589 --> 32:04.466
<i>and hold on to your hats</i>

32:04.507 --> 32:07.385
<i>because this rodeo is gonna be</i>
<i>one heck of a ride.</i>

32:07.427 --> 32:09.596
<i>But first Casey McMurtry</i>
<i>would like to say</i>

32:09.637 --> 32:12.849
<i>a few words to kick</i>
<i>this thing off.</i>

32:12.891 --> 32:14.809
- What a great crowd
we have today.

32:14.851 --> 32:16.686
I wanna thank you all
for coming out!

32:16.728 --> 32:18.146
(Applause and cheering)

32:20.565 --> 32:23.401
It has been such a thrill
for me to,

32:23.443 --> 32:25.862
to put on this event and
so many others over the years.

32:25.904 --> 32:29.366
But the time has come for me
to hand the reins

32:29.407 --> 32:31.951
of my late husband,
Hank McMurtry's company,

32:31.993 --> 32:35.747
over to the only person in
the world that I could trust

32:35.789 --> 32:37.624
to carry on his tradition
of putting on

32:37.665 --> 32:40.085
<i>the most exciting rodeos</i>
<i>on the circuit.</i>

32:40.126 --> 32:42.253
He's Foothills Hall of Famer,

32:42.295 --> 32:43.463
and Hudson's very own...

32:44.589 --> 32:46.800
Tim Fleming.

32:46.841 --> 32:48.551
(Applause and cheering)

32:48.593 --> 32:51.346
- Thank you.

32:51.388 --> 32:53.139
Well, let's give it up
for Casey McMurtry.

32:53.181 --> 32:54.683
(Applause)

32:56.893 --> 32:59.437
I'm gonna have some big
boots to fill.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.356
But I'm up for the challenge.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.859
I guess, where I, I, I...

33:08.780 --> 33:10.448
(Exhales)

33:10.490 --> 33:12.200
You gotta be kidding me.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.744
(Crowd jeers)

33:14.786 --> 33:16.371
Ah... just... folks,

33:17.497 --> 33:19.416
folks...

33:19.457 --> 33:21.876
it seems that there is
a group of people here

33:21.918 --> 33:24.671
that have something to say
and in my opinion ah...

33:26.506 --> 33:28.842
they've earned the right
to be heard.

33:28.883 --> 33:31.678
These, these are some of
the greatest rodeo legends

33:31.720 --> 33:34.222
of all time. Right here.
Right in front of us.

33:34.264 --> 33:35.557
(Applause)

33:38.184 --> 33:39.394
Jack.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.480
May I?

33:45.734 --> 33:47.694
- Hi everybody.
- Woo-hoo! (Applause)

33:47.736 --> 33:49.571
- My name is Jack Bartlett.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.407
Now... like Tim said,

33:53.700 --> 33:56.244
these people here

33:56.286 --> 33:59.289
<i>are bona fide rodeo legends.</i>

33:59.330 --> 34:01.750
<i>They're some of the most fierce</i>
<i>competitors</i>

34:01.791 --> 34:03.585
<i>that have ever graced</i>
<i>these grounds.</i>

34:04.878 --> 34:07.464
But it's a tough sport.

34:07.505 --> 34:10.759
And years of throwing their
heart and soul into the rodeo...

34:10.800 --> 34:12.552
well, it's taken its toll.

34:14.637 --> 34:16.764
We feel that as a community

34:16.806 --> 34:19.351
that we should do something
to help these people

34:19.391 --> 34:21.226
and ease their burden.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.523
It's a bit hypocritical to be
celebrating our heritage

34:25.565 --> 34:27.650
when we haven't been able
to take care of the people

34:27.692 --> 34:30.695
who are most responsible for it.

34:30.737 --> 34:32.614
<i>So tell me, what are we gonna</i>
<i>do about it?</i>

34:34.366 --> 34:35.617
Tim?

34:38.786 --> 34:41.414
- Okay, so here's
what I'm proposing.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.418
I'm going to donate all of
the profits

34:46.460 --> 34:48.088
from today's rodeo

34:48.129 --> 34:51.299
toward a fund for retired
rodeo competitors

34:51.341 --> 34:53.927
long after they've hung up
their hat and spurs.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.429
(Cheering and applause)

34:59.516 --> 35:01.309
Thank you.

35:01.351 --> 35:03.061
But there is a group of rodeo
owners here today

35:03.103 --> 35:05.105
that I would expect
the same from.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.524
Are you willing to donate a
percentage of your profits?

35:07.565 --> 35:09.067
(Encouraging cheers)

35:09.109 --> 35:10.944
Tim: What do you say?
Crowd: Woo! Come on!

35:10.985 --> 35:13.154
<i>- Can I get a commitment?</i>

35:13.196 --> 35:15.073
<i>Looks like a yes!</i>
<i>What do you say, folks?</i>

35:15.115 --> 35:17.158
Okay?
(Cheering and applause)

35:18.618 --> 35:20.161
Great.
Hey, bring them up.

35:21.579 --> 35:22.622
- Thank you.
Woman: That's right!

35:24.624 --> 35:26.042
- Well, folks,
thank you so much

35:26.084 --> 35:28.294
for that warm gesture.

35:30.672 --> 35:32.799
I think it's time
to properly introduce

35:32.841 --> 35:34.759
the legends of the rodeo.

35:34.801 --> 35:36.594
They're right here
in the front row.

35:36.636 --> 35:39.097
<i>There is Tom Garner.</i>
<i>(Applause)</i>

35:39.139 --> 35:42.308
<i>We have Fran Dauber</i>
<i>and Darcy Bream...</i>

35:42.350 --> 35:44.019
<i>and Sid Carson.</i>

35:44.060 --> 35:46.396
<i>And the one and only</i>

35:46.438 --> 35:49.065
<i>"Lucky" Butch Connelly,</i>
<i>right there!</i>

35:49.107 --> 35:51.693

35:54.988 --> 35:57.323
(Cheering and applause)

35:59.534 --> 36:06.166
**

36:09.336 --> 36:11.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:11.504 --> 36:12.881
What are you doing back here?

36:12.922 --> 36:14.507
- I thought I'd come wish
you luck in the broncs.

36:14.549 --> 36:15.800
- Thanks.

36:15.842 --> 36:17.677
Gotta keep up this hot streak.

36:17.719 --> 36:19.346
Get another big win
like yesterday.

36:19.387 --> 36:21.014
- What big win?

36:21.056 --> 36:23.308
- The jump I did.

36:23.350 --> 36:24.768
- (Chuckles) Well,

36:24.809 --> 36:26.686
I did way better at roping.

36:26.728 --> 36:28.355
You know, I won, right?

36:28.396 --> 36:29.898
- Did Amy say that?

36:29.939 --> 36:32.776
- Well, no, but...

36:32.817 --> 36:34.361
I felt too bad
about Spartan to ask.

36:35.528 --> 36:37.030
- Well...

36:37.072 --> 36:38.907
I think you did better
than I thought you would.

36:38.948 --> 36:40.658
- Thanks.
You did pretty good too.

36:42.118 --> 36:43.703
- So what do you say?
Call it a draw?

36:43.745 --> 36:45.413
- Yeah... sure.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.960
- Hey, also I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

36:51.002 --> 36:53.171
- It's okay.

36:53.213 --> 36:55.048
You're not the worst roommate
in the entire world.

36:55.090 --> 36:57.425
- No, I mean,
I'm sorry about Quinn.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.554
- It's okay.

37:07.102 --> 37:09.145
<i>Tim: Please join me</i>
<i>in welcoming</i>

37:09.187 --> 37:11.106
our lead sponsor, J.D. Werth,

37:11.147 --> 37:13.400
he'd like to have a few words
with you.

37:13.441 --> 37:15.735
(Applause)
- Thank you.

37:15.777 --> 37:16.986
Let's hear it for Hudson!

37:17.028 --> 37:19.155
(Cheering and applause)

37:19.197 --> 37:21.199
<i>What an amazing event</i>

37:21.241 --> 37:23.618
to revel in our glorious past,

37:23.660 --> 37:25.829
but right now I have some news

37:25.870 --> 37:28.081
about our town's bright future.

37:28.123 --> 37:30.834
I am humbled to announce
by way of acclamation...

37:30.875 --> 37:34.087
I will be your next mayor...

Stop! Excuse me.

37:39.926 --> 37:41.761
Excuse me. Pardon me.

37:41.803 --> 37:43.596
I'm sorry for the interruption,
everyone.

37:43.638 --> 37:45.807
But I think before you go
any further...

37:47.058 --> 37:49.185
that the people of Hudson

37:49.227 --> 37:51.938
should decide their next mayor
at the ballot box.

37:51.980 --> 37:54.733
(Cheering and applause)

37:58.820 --> 38:00.113
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.740
Hi. May I?

38:01.781 --> 38:03.658
Sorry.

38:03.700 --> 38:06.619
My name's Lou Fleming.
Woman: Yeah, Lou!

38:06.661 --> 38:08.413
Many of you know me as the
woman who pours your coffee

38:08.455 --> 38:10.707
down at Maggie's.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.042
But I am more than
just a business owner,

38:12.083 --> 38:15.587
I am also a proud member
of this community.

38:18.673 --> 38:21.801
This rodeo is a celebration
of Hudson

38:21.843 --> 38:24.721
and of everything that
generations of people

38:24.763 --> 38:26.473
have worked so hard
to build...

38:28.141 --> 38:29.976
and I wanna protect that.

38:30.018 --> 38:31.686
Which is why I've made
a decision...

38:34.981 --> 38:37.692
<i>I'm officially throwing</i>
<i>my hat in the ring.</i>

38:37.734 --> 38:40.028
And I too,

38:40.070 --> 38:42.947
will be running to be
your next mayor of Hudson.

38:54.084 --> 38:56.127

**

39:09.808 --> 39:11.559
- Thanks for getting the ball
rolling out there.

39:13.645 --> 39:15.188
- Yeah. Well, you didn't
give me much choice.

39:15.230 --> 39:16.648
- (Chuckles)

39:16.690 --> 39:18.692
- What was with that protest?

39:18.733 --> 39:20.735
Come on, you just about ruined
my first rodeo.

39:20.777 --> 39:23.613
- I've seen you perform
a hundred times

39:23.655 --> 39:25.657
in this arena and I knew
you'd come through.

39:25.699 --> 39:27.409
- Hmm.

39:28.618 --> 39:30.995
- But I gotta say,

39:31.037 --> 39:33.331
of all the great rides
you've made,

39:33.373 --> 39:34.916
and all the buckles
you've ever won...

39:36.668 --> 39:39.045
what you did today...

39:39.087 --> 39:40.839
I couldn't be more proud.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.094
- Still mad at you.

39:48.304 --> 39:50.432
- (Laughs)

39:56.187 --> 39:57.564
- Hey, Case.

40:00.108 --> 40:01.735
I needed to talk to you
about something.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.906
Well, it wasn't that long ago

40:06.948 --> 40:08.700
that I asked you to marry me...

40:08.742 --> 40:10.660
and you said no.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.704
- Really? You wanna get
into that here?

40:12.746 --> 40:13.997
- Yeah. Yeah. I do...

40:14.039 --> 40:15.415
wanna get into that right now.

40:16.833 --> 40:19.294
- Okay. Well, first of all
I didn't say no.

40:19.336 --> 40:21.212
We said no.

40:21.254 --> 40:22.964
We both decided
it didn't feel right.

40:23.006 --> 40:24.466
- Okay. But now...

40:26.760 --> 40:28.678
seemingly over night,

40:28.720 --> 40:30.555
you're getting married

40:30.597 --> 40:32.140
to someone else.

40:34.434 --> 40:36.728
And I just wonder
what makes him more right?

40:40.148 --> 40:41.441
- I don't know.

40:44.694 --> 40:46.654
I don't know, a lot of things.

40:46.696 --> 40:49.199
But most of all,

40:49.240 --> 40:51.743
I just, I feel like,

40:51.785 --> 40:53.161
I know what I'm gonna get
with Greg.

40:55.038 --> 40:56.915
He's just...

40:56.956 --> 40:58.833
he's not as challenging.

41:00.377 --> 41:02.879
- So I'm challenging?

41:02.921 --> 41:04.172
- Yes, yes you are.

41:05.799 --> 41:07.842
I mean, you've got this,
this crazy energy...

41:07.884 --> 41:10.762
and our time together
it just felt like

41:10.804 --> 41:12.263
we were a going a 100 miles
an hour.

41:12.305 --> 41:14.140
And I was always off balance
and...

41:14.182 --> 41:16.226
(Sighs)

41:16.267 --> 41:17.977
you wore me out.

41:20.188 --> 41:21.856
No.

41:21.898 --> 41:22.816
I'm s-

41:25.151 --> 41:26.861
Look, even though we don't
work as a couple...

41:28.905 --> 41:30.865
you played such a big part
in the person that I am today.

41:33.451 --> 41:35.120
- Well, that's great.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.044
You know I've been thinking
about buying your company,

41:46.381 --> 41:48.508
but I think it's more
your thing than mine.

41:50.051 --> 41:51.469
- Wha...?

41:51.511 --> 41:53.263
You-you can't do that.
We had a deal?

41:53.304 --> 41:55.557
- You got a great operation.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.727
You'll find somebody
to buy it in a minute.

42:01.896 --> 42:03.648
Case, you know,

42:03.690 --> 42:05.859
I think...

42:05.900 --> 42:08.737
it's finally time that
we make a clean break.

42:08.778 --> 42:09.904
Don't you?

42:12.949 --> 42:14.242
I wish you all the best.

42:16.202 --> 42:17.746
I really do,
to both of you.

42:17.787 --> 42:19.914
You know I do.

42:19.956 --> 42:21.750
- It's better this way.
- Mhmm.
