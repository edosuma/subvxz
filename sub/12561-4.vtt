hospital trustee die

00:03.774 --> 00:05.346
To save some kid
off the street.

00:05.348 --> 00:07.090
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

- This trip is gonna get you
back on your feet.

00:08.556 --> 00:10.741

- To the Hamptons!

It's genetic.
- Quite fatal.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.435
- And I will.

01:35.708 --> 01:38.407
- Did Boris inherit more than
a European banking empire, Hank?

01:41.542 --> 01:43.742
So he summoned you
to the manor?

01:43.743 --> 01:45.308
- No, to his winter residence.

01:45.309 --> 01:47.676
I guess that's billionaire speak
for the city.

01:47.677 --> 01:48.843
- Well, I'm going
to the city right now.

01:48.844 --> 01:50.310
You want a ride?

01:50.311 --> 01:51.945
- Boris sent his car.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.345
- To take you to the city?

01:53.346 --> 01:54.679
- To take me to the airport.

Henry.

02:02.483 --> 02:03.482
Please take the baggage.

02:03.483 --> 02:04.783
- I will not take the baggage.

02:04.784 --> 02:06.950
- Please take the baggage.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.554
You do know Manhattan
is like 90 miles away, right?

02:15.555 --> 02:17.322
It's gonna be, like,
an 11-minute flight.

02:17.323 --> 02:18.322
- Yeah, only Boris
would send a plane

02:18.323 --> 02:19.790
To do a helicopter's job.

02:19.791 --> 02:20.957
- All right, first of all,
let's show some respect here.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.058
It's not a plane, it's a jet.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.592
And secondly...
and this is my point...

02:23.593 --> 02:24.926
You'll never even know
I'm there, like I...

02:24.927 --> 02:26.694
- Look, he sent this thing
so I could come quickly

02:26.695 --> 02:29.728
And go quickly without
any encumbrances... no offense.

02:29.729 --> 02:31.162
- Hank, I have business
in the city.

If you leave me here,
I'm gonna drive anyway.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.870
Let's just jet pool
and reduce our carbon footprint.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.004
Think about it, Hank.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.204
You could do
the right thing here,

02:53.205 --> 02:54.705
Or you could kill a polar bear.

02:54.706 --> 02:57.373
- All right, don't distract me.
Don't distract the pilot.

02:57.374 --> 02:59.975
And don't show anyone any more

02:59.976 --> 03:01.809

03:01.810 --> 03:03.743
- And don't do that, either.
- Okay.

03:12.682 --> 03:14.582
- Henry...

03:14.583 --> 03:15.950
- What?

03:15.951 --> 03:17.517
- These seats
are made of lambskin.

03:17.518 --> 03:19.451
- Oh...What a relief.

03:19.452 --> 03:21.352
- How much to you
think this costs?

03:21.353 --> 03:22.754
- The seat or the plane?

03:22.755 --> 03:24.021
- Dude, it's a jet.

03:29.224 --> 03:31.092

04:09.281 --> 04:10.848

04:10.849 --> 04:12.048
- Why, you know where we are?

04:12.049 --> 04:14.316
- We're on a very exclusive
island.

04:14.317 --> 04:17.250
- That is definitely
an acceptable surprise.

04:17.252 --> 04:18.785

I trust.

04:57.044 --> 04:58.545
- Yeah.

04:58.546 --> 04:59.813
Must have been
an expensive flight.

04:59.814 --> 05:01.581
Especially
the landing in Cuba part.

05:01.582 --> 05:03.583

Told you it's called a jet.

05:03.584 --> 05:04.718

05:04.719 --> 05:06.119

05:06.120 --> 05:09.622
But we'll be heading
into town soon, so...

05:09.623 --> 05:10.790
- This is so awesome.

05:10.791 --> 05:12.392
I've wanted to see Cuba
my entire life.

05:12.393 --> 05:14.060
So where are we gonna start?

05:14.061 --> 05:15.562

Okay. Great.

I'll see you guys soon.

05:32.339 --> 05:34.407
- Good.

05:34.408 --> 05:36.008
For the record...

05:36.009 --> 05:37.242
I know you're a busy man,

05:37.243 --> 05:38.944
And sometimes I'll have
to come to you.

05:38.945 --> 05:41.413
But I don't appreciate
being renditioned.

05:41.414 --> 05:43.014
- Would you have
willingly traveled

05:43.015 --> 05:44.816
To an embargoed nation, Hank?

05:44.817 --> 05:47.085
- I guess we'll never know.

05:47.086 --> 05:48.453
- You'll be home by Monday.

05:48.454 --> 05:50.955
I took the liberty of finding
someone to replace you

05:50.956 --> 05:52.823
For the weekend
in the Hamptons.

05:52.824 --> 05:54.057
- Really?

05:54.058 --> 05:55.325
Well, that is quite a liberty.

05:55.326 --> 05:57.294
Doctors typically have some say
in who covers for them.

05:57.295 --> 05:59.962
- Ours is not
a typical situation.

05:59.963 --> 06:01.630
Wouldn't you agree?

06:01.631 --> 06:03.966
- Okay, let's discuss
why I'm here.

06:03.967 --> 06:06.968
I assume it has to to do with
the Cuban geneticist you saw,

06:06.969 --> 06:08.269
Dr. Casseras.

06:08.270 --> 06:11.238
- She's put my markers
to good use.

06:11.239 --> 06:14.041
Dr. Casseras
has diagnosed me, Hank.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.975
- With what?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.209
- Well, the naming board
is still haggling

06:17.210 --> 06:19.078
Over what to call it.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.279
But it appears
that I'm carrying a rare

06:21.280 --> 06:22.813
Hereditary mutation

06:22.814 --> 06:24.781
In the ninth chromosome

06:24.782 --> 06:26.616
Of the vcp gene.

06:26.617 --> 06:28.718
- Okay, genetics
isn't my field, Boris.

06:28.719 --> 06:30.853
- It means that one day,
perhaps quite soon,

06:30.854 --> 06:32.688
My muscles will turn to jelly

06:32.689 --> 06:35.625
And my bones will
become breadsticks.

06:35.626 --> 06:38.828
Fortunately,
once the dementia sets in,

06:38.829 --> 06:41.530
I'll be too oblivious to mind
any of that.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.665
- But you didn't fly
all the way down here

06:43.666 --> 06:45.134
Just so she could
tell you that.

06:45.135 --> 06:47.638
- No, I flew down here
because she has a clinical trial

06:47.639 --> 06:49.507
For a very promising protocol.

06:49.508 --> 06:51.008
- Huh.

06:51.009 --> 06:52.376
All right, well,

06:52.377 --> 06:53.977
In order to be cleared
for something like that,

06:53.978 --> 06:56.613
You'd need a careful
and thorough evaluation.

06:56.614 --> 06:58.048
And that's why I'm here.

06:58.049 --> 07:00.850
- Blood tests, bone scans,

07:00.851 --> 07:03.285
Cardiovascular evaluations.

to enjoy without you, Hank.

07:26.373 --> 07:28.273
- Replacement?

07:28.274 --> 07:30.075
[chuckles] why would he
need replacing?

07:30.076 --> 07:32.444

- Mm-hmm.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.020

07:49.661 --> 07:51.828

07:56.933 --> 07:58.166
When you're on time,
you're late.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.335
And when you're late,
you're fired.

08:00.336 --> 08:02.904
At least, that's my philosophy.

[electronic beeping]

08:12.215 --> 08:13.915
- What is that?

08:13.916 --> 08:15.450

08:18.554 --> 08:19.954
Is he gonna be all right?

been brought down here

08:20.955 --> 08:23.122
Against my will to determine.

08:23.123 --> 08:25.791
- I'm really sad right now.
- Why?

08:25.792 --> 08:27.759
- I thought we were gonna
conquer this place together.

08:35.668 --> 08:37.135
I guess I'm on a solo mission.

08:37.135 --> 08:39.602

09:35.784 --> 09:37.584
- I don't have any ca...
no English?

09:37.585 --> 09:40.153
<i>- Here. Dos.</i>

09:40.154 --> 09:41.454
<i>- Dos?
- Dos.</i>

09:41.455 --> 09:42.721
- Okay.
- Hey.

09:42.722 --> 09:43.855
- Did you must pay for me?

09:43.856 --> 09:45.823
<i>- Si.
- For wha...</i>

09:45.824 --> 09:47.959
<i>Gracias,
very muchas.</i>

09:47.960 --> 09:50.461
<i>- Uh, you're welcome, muchas.</i>

09:50.462 --> 09:51.628
I'm Mindy.

09:51.629 --> 09:53.030
- Evan. You're American.

09:53.031 --> 09:54.197
- Canadian.

09:54.198 --> 09:55.799
- Really?
- Mm.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.033
- Oh, I thought your people
were more into ice fishing

09:57.034 --> 09:58.435
Than scuba diving.

09:58.436 --> 09:59.802
- Well, I thought your people
had tons of cash

09:59.803 --> 10:01.637
That you just
carried around with you.

10:01.638 --> 10:03.005
- [laughs]

10:03.006 --> 10:04.440
I actually flew in
on short notice,

10:04.441 --> 10:06.375
A business trip.
What brings you down here?

10:06.376 --> 10:08.511
- Well, lucky for you,
my friends are lame,

10:08.512 --> 10:10.613
And they decided
that it was too sunny today

10:10.614 --> 10:11.881
Not to work on their tan.

10:11.882 --> 10:13.149
They're gonna scuba tomorrow.

10:13.150 --> 10:15.851
So you get to be my dive buddy.

10:15.852 --> 10:18.621
- Well...Lucky for you
I'm available.

10:18.622 --> 10:20.892
- Great, okay.
Shall we?

10:20.893 --> 10:22.894
- Yeah.

10:22.895 --> 10:24.062
Huh.

10:24.063 --> 10:25.596
- 20 laboratories,

10:25.597 --> 10:29.200
100 researchers
working in five major sections

10:29.201 --> 10:30.868
Of genetic Stu.

10:30.869 --> 10:33.137
- You sea kn
about th. Ist Ce

10:33.138 --> 10:37.675
Ah - ! Dr. Cass as.

10:37.676 --> 10:39.844
May I introduce Dr. Lawson.

10:39.845 --> 10:42.179
- Ah, it's nice to finally
meet you, doctor.

10:42.180 --> 10:44.882
I called from New York
and left a few voice mails,

10:44.883 --> 10:46.350
But never heard back.

10:46.351 --> 10:47.718
- Nothing personal.

10:47.719 --> 10:50.154
It's harder to call the U.S.
Than to swim there.

10:50.155 --> 10:51.489
- Huh.

10:51.490 --> 10:53.224
This is a very impressive
facility.

10:53.225 --> 10:54.525
- You sound surprised.

10:54.526 --> 10:55.559
- No, not surprised.

10:55.560 --> 10:56.927
Just...Impressed.

10:56.928 --> 10:59.163
- Well, I must thank you
for encouraging Boris

10:59.164 --> 11:02.032
To pursue genetic testing
as a road to diagnosis.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.367
- That's true, Hank.

11:03.368 --> 11:04.668
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be here.

11:04.669 --> 11:07.104
- But I must say,
I did not expect

11:07.105 --> 11:08.571
To find you here with him.

11:08.572 --> 11:10.073
- Oh, I'm only here
to do his workup.

11:10.074 --> 11:13.710
- Hank was just drawing
some...Blood.

11:13.711 --> 11:16.079
- But we're more than capable
of doing the workup.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.880
It is, after all, our study.

11:17.881 --> 11:21.150
- Dr. Lawson is my medical
quarterback.

11:21.151 --> 11:23.252
<i>So, con su permiso.</i>

11:23.253 --> 11:26.288
- We both know
you don't need my permission.

11:28.091 --> 11:29.892
So...

11:29.893 --> 11:32.594
Welcome to the team,
Dr. Quarterback.

11:35.698 --> 11:38.299
- Uh, Dr. Casseras.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.701
You mind if I review
your protocol?

11:53.549 --> 11:55.550
I think she likes me.

11:55.551 --> 11:56.818
- [chuckles]

12:00.890 --> 12:04.491
[indistinct chatter]

12:06.894 --> 12:07.894
- Thank you, countess.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.095
- Okay. Take care.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.563
- You too!
- Bye, darling.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.338
- [sighs]

12:24.577 --> 12:27.345
- I can turn on
the radio, if you want.

12:27.346 --> 12:29.580
- Sorry, did you say something?

12:29.581 --> 12:31.548
- I'd be happy
to play some music.

12:31.549 --> 12:34.818
- Oh, it's not music.
It's my podcast.

12:34.819 --> 12:37.286
- You produce your own podcast?

12:37.287 --> 12:39.755
- Welcome to the medicine
of tomorrow.

12:43.025 --> 12:44.025
[knocks]

12:44.026 --> 12:45.660
- Sorry to bother you.

12:45.661 --> 12:49.630
I was just wondering when I
might get that blood work back.

12:49.631 --> 12:52.232
- I will do my best
to expedite it for you.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.334
- Thank you so much.

12:56.604 --> 12:58.505
Congratulations.

13:00.074 --> 13:02.376
You're lucky to have a generous
man like Boris

13:02.377 --> 13:05.413
As a benefactor.

13:05.414 --> 13:08.281
- I understand why
he would be suspicious.

13:08.282 --> 13:09.316
As an American.

13:09.317 --> 13:11.251
I know that, where you're from,

13:11.252 --> 13:14.186
Hope is often sold
to the highest bidder.

13:14.187 --> 13:17.757
That is not how it works here.
Not in this country.

13:17.758 --> 13:19.959
And certainly not
in this building.

13:22.029 --> 13:23.963
- I'm not suspicious
as an American,

13:23.964 --> 13:26.331
Just interested as a doctor.

13:26.332 --> 13:29.035
- Hmm.
Have you read my protocol?

13:29.036 --> 13:31.171
- I'm still, uh,
getting through it.

13:31.172 --> 13:32.339
- [chuckles]

13:32.340 --> 13:33.873
Genetics is not your domain.

13:33.874 --> 13:36.276
- No, it's not.

13:36.277 --> 13:38.444
But I have to make sure
Boris doesn't endanger his life

13:38.445 --> 13:40.547
By trying to save it.

13:40.548 --> 13:42.181
That's my domain.

13:50.424 --> 13:52.159
- [gasps]

13:52.160 --> 13:54.895
- Whew.
- That was incredible.

13:54.896 --> 13:55.896
- Which part?

13:55.897 --> 13:57.531
The fish or the caves

13:57.532 --> 13:59.133
Or the coral reef?

13:59.134 --> 14:01.235
- Well...The best part
for me

14:01.236 --> 14:03.505
Was by far
when your top came off.

14:03.506 --> 14:04.940
- [laughs]

14:04.941 --> 14:07.843
And yet, I felt pretty
comfortable with you down there.

14:07.844 --> 14:09.411
- That's good.

14:09.412 --> 14:10.545
You know, I am a creature
of the ocean.

14:10.546 --> 14:12.080
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I live in the Hamptons.

14:12.081 --> 14:14.149
- Uh-huh.
- [coughing]

14:14.150 --> 14:15.183
- That's hot.

14:15.184 --> 14:16.685
- [sputtering] thank you.

14:16.686 --> 14:19.221
- [shouting in Spanish]

14:21.457 --> 14:22.990
- What is he saying?
"Medusa"?

14:22.991 --> 14:24.358
- I don't know...

14:24.359 --> 14:26.860
That there's a mythical
Greek gorgon in the water?

14:26.861 --> 14:30.597
What is...There's
a giant jellyfish right there.

14:30.598 --> 14:32.365
- What?
What?! That's a man o' war!

14:32.366 --> 14:33.766
Quick! Quick!

14:35.302 --> 14:37.203
- [shouting in Spanish]

14:46.577 --> 14:48.378
- Uhh!

14:55.886 --> 14:57.253
[Velcro rips]

14:57.254 --> 14:58.587
- You got it?

14:58.588 --> 14:59.788
- [breathless] okay.

14:59.789 --> 15:01.389
- Oh, my God.

15:01.390 --> 15:03.724
- Ohh. Ohh.

15:03.725 --> 15:04.725
[clang]

15:04.726 --> 15:06.627
- Oh. Oh, God!

15:06.628 --> 15:08.395
Oh, God!

15:12.111 --> 15:13.244
- Did I just sustain
a scuba diving injury?

15:13.245 --> 15:14.444
On the boat?

15:14.445 --> 15:15.779
- He should be here any second.

15:15.780 --> 15:17.380
- Don't worry, Evan.
You're gonna be okay.

15:17.381 --> 15:19.382
- There he is.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.585
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:22.586 --> 15:23.820
- Thank God.

15:23.821 --> 15:25.087
Okay, this is Mindy,
my diving buddy.

15:25.088 --> 15:26.289
- Hi, Mindy.
What happened to him?

15:26.290 --> 15:28.590
- I accidentally whacked him
with my tank.

15:28.591 --> 15:29.624
There was a lot of blood.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.925
- Did he lose consciousness?

15:30.926 --> 15:32.259
- No.
- Any... any nausea?

15:32.260 --> 15:33.762
- No, it's just a crap load
of pain.

15:33.763 --> 15:35.096
- All right, let me see.

15:35.097 --> 15:37.031
Ah, come here.
Any pain here?

15:37.032 --> 15:38.500
- No, no, no... it's just
around the hole in my head.

15:38.501 --> 15:39.701
Look.
- Oh, okay.

15:39.702 --> 15:42.403
Follow my finger, please.

15:42.404 --> 15:44.906
Good. Okay, now,
let's see that cut.

15:44.907 --> 15:47.109
[winces] okay.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.944
[unzips bag]

15:49.945 --> 15:51.913
Huh. These aren't the gloves

15:51.914 --> 15:53.814
And suturing Kit
I was hoping to find.

15:53.815 --> 15:55.282
- That's why
I monogrammed the bags.

15:55.283 --> 15:57.750
- Great.
Okay.

15:57.751 --> 16:01.153
Good.

16:01.154 --> 16:04.223
I need that beach bag.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.858
Thank you.
All right, sorry, bro.

16:05.859 --> 16:07.059
You're gonna get
a little wet again.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.229
- That's all right.
- Ooh. [winces]

16:09.230 --> 16:11.998
- Ow, ah. Ah.

16:11.999 --> 16:15.167
That burns.

16:15.168 --> 16:16.501
- What are you doing?

16:16.502 --> 16:17.902
- It's called the hat trick.

16:17.903 --> 16:20.338
I'm gonna Twist hairs
on both sides of the laceration

16:20.339 --> 16:21.605
To make braids.

16:21.606 --> 16:22.906
- Do you really think
this is the right time

16:22.907 --> 16:24.341
For me to get my hair did, huh?

16:24.342 --> 16:25.342
- It's to close up your wound.

16:25.343 --> 16:27.076
- Ah. Ah. Oww.

16:27.077 --> 16:29.111
- All right, Mindy, can you
hold down this braid for me?

16:29.112 --> 16:30.746
- Can you stop calling them
braids, please?

16:30.747 --> 16:32.581
- That's what they are.
- Okay.

16:39.287 --> 16:40.955
- Thank you.

16:42.957 --> 16:44.324
- Mother...

16:44.325 --> 16:45.591
<i>Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!</i>

16:45.592 --> 16:47.026
- Okay, all right.

16:47.027 --> 16:48.627
There we go.

16:48.628 --> 16:49.761
- Wow.

16:49.762 --> 16:51.262
That was impressive.

16:51.263 --> 16:52.564
And the wound's
gonna heal like that?

16:52.565 --> 16:53.999
- Within ten days,
it should, yeah.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.301
- I'm guessing we can't
say the same

16:55.302 --> 16:56.969
For my martyred beach bag.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.204
- Sorry about that.
- Ohh.

16:59.205 --> 17:00.972
Evan, I'm so sorry.

17:00.973 --> 17:02.673
Can I... can I take you
for a drink or something

17:02.674 --> 17:03.674
To make it up to you?

17:03.675 --> 17:05.076
Sure, yeah.

17:05.077 --> 17:06.810
That sounds like reasonable
compensation.

17:06.810 --> 17:08.178
- Actually, blunt force trauma
and alcohol don't mix.

17:08.179 --> 17:09.679
Sorry, bro.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.281
- Oh...Well, at least you have
a note from your doctor.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.214
- Well, if we ever
meet again, though,

17:14.215 --> 17:15.916
Like in Saskatchewan
or Winnipeg or something,

17:15.917 --> 17:16.983
It's on.

17:16.984 --> 17:18.919
- Okay.

17:18.920 --> 17:19.987
Bye.
- Bye.

17:19.988 --> 17:21.954
- Sorry.
- No, no, it's cool.

17:21.955 --> 17:23.390
- Nice to meet you guys.
Bye.

17:23.391 --> 17:25.959
- Bye.
- Bye. Come on.

17:28.497 --> 17:31.099
- Diagnosis:
Lateral epicondylitis, period.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.634
Treatment:
Sling, naprosyn,

17:32.635 --> 17:34.635
500 milligrams
b.I.D., period.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.837
Signed Emily PE...
- Dr. Peck...

17:36.838 --> 17:38.805
Here's what you need to know
about our next patient,

17:38.806 --> 17:39.805
Alan Ryder.

17:39.806 --> 17:42.040
He can be...A handful.

17:42.041 --> 17:46.411
He's impatient
and squeamish and...

17:46.412 --> 17:47.812
Period.

17:47.813 --> 17:49.246
- You went to Harricks?
- Mm-hmm.

17:49.247 --> 17:50.547
- Wheatley.

17:50.548 --> 17:51.981
- Well, I assumed,

17:51.982 --> 17:54.549
What with the oversized
contemporary mansion and all.

17:54.550 --> 17:55.850
- Hey, my dad made his own Mon,

17:55.851 --> 17:57.218
And he made me make my own too.

17:57.219 --> 17:58.420
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.421 --> 17:59.887
- Hope you followed that logic.

17:59.888 --> 18:03.056
Might be a little complex
for a Harricks grad.

18:03.057 --> 18:04.057
- [laughs]

18:04.058 --> 18:05.426
- Sorry to interrupt,

18:05.427 --> 18:07.561
But shall we get down
to the business at hand?

18:07.562 --> 18:09.829
- My migraines
haven't gone away.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.231
- Have they
changed in character

18:11.232 --> 18:13.065
Since Dr. Lawson
saw you last?

18:13.066 --> 18:15.000
- No. But the medicine
he prescribed

18:15.001 --> 18:16.068
Only helped a little,

18:16.069 --> 18:17.669
And wife's out of town,

18:17.670 --> 18:19.737
So no one is here
to massage my temples.

18:19.738 --> 18:22.506
- Okay, well, let's
explore this further.

18:22.507 --> 18:24.074
Open wide.

18:28.445 --> 18:29.545
- Ah!

18:29.546 --> 18:31.681
- That's great.

18:31.682 --> 18:34.250
Okay.

18:34.251 --> 18:36.252
[beep beep]

18:36.253 --> 18:39.088
16.0.

18:39.089 --> 18:40.456
Order an MRI.

18:40.457 --> 18:43.692
I also want a CBC,
a smac-7, and an esr.

18:43.693 --> 18:46.061
I want to rule out
temporal arteritis.

18:46.062 --> 18:47.896
- He's had these migraines
for years.

18:47.897 --> 18:50.032
I mean, why waste his time
and money?

18:50.033 --> 18:52.100
Mr. Ryder, you need
to give the inderal

18:52.101 --> 18:53.635
A real chance to work.

18:53.636 --> 18:55.904
- Alan, I believe in
aggressive diagnostics.

18:55.905 --> 18:57.072
It saves time in the long run,

18:57.073 --> 18:58.707
Helps you sleep better
along the way.

18:58.708 --> 19:01.109
So we will call you
and schedule those tests.

19:01.110 --> 19:02.910
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

19:02.911 --> 19:05.313
And before we leave...

19:05.314 --> 19:06.615
Fill this up.

19:06.616 --> 19:08.684
Hand it to Divya
when you're done.

19:12.021 --> 19:14.824
- Dinner was so good, Boris.
Thank you so much.

19:14.825 --> 19:16.325
- Yeah, thanks.

19:16.326 --> 19:18.894
- People come from all over
for that congri.

19:18.895 --> 19:20.329
- Yeah?

19:20.330 --> 19:22.732
You guys look like you're
enjoying your mojitos even more.

19:22.733 --> 19:24.466
I think I'm the only person
in the Caribbean

19:24.467 --> 19:25.734
On a cocktail ban.

19:25.735 --> 19:27.369
- Oh, sorry, Ev.

19:27.370 --> 19:28.503
- Like, who knows how far

19:28.504 --> 19:30.138
Things could have gone
with that girl.

19:30.139 --> 19:32.473
She was...
she was Canadian, Hank.

19:32.474 --> 19:33.741
<i>She was Canadian.</i>

19:33.742 --> 19:35.910
- Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

19:35.911 --> 19:37.946
He's had his trouble
with girls.

19:37.947 --> 19:40.748
- Who has not?

19:40.749 --> 19:42.517
- So where
are we going exactly?

19:42.518 --> 19:44.586
- I want to show you something.

19:44.587 --> 19:46.154
- I've lived on your property
for weeks,

19:46.155 --> 19:47.522
And we've never shared a meal.

19:47.523 --> 19:48.891
One night in Cuba,

19:48.892 --> 19:51.327
And we're taking
a post-supper stroll.

19:51.328 --> 19:54.764
- I feel a powerful connection
with this place.

19:54.765 --> 19:56.766
Maybe because it's one of
the few places I can walaround

19:56.767 --> 19:59.535
Without bodyguards and...

19:59.536 --> 20:02.538
Or maybe it's because
Cuba and I are so alike.

20:02.539 --> 20:04.541
- How so?

20:04.542 --> 20:05.976
- We're both
waiting for the news

20:05.977 --> 20:08.178
That will change everything.

20:08.179 --> 20:11.148
- I understand how hopeful
this diagnosis has made you.

20:11.149 --> 20:14.184
- What do you think of
Dr. Casseras's clinical trial?

20:14.185 --> 20:15.753
- I support
early-phase studies,

20:15.754 --> 20:17.154
And what I see so far
is impressive.

20:17.155 --> 20:19.357
I just need to finish
my due diligence.

20:19.358 --> 20:21.792
That is why I'm here, isn't it?

20:21.793 --> 20:22.927
- Estova square.

20:22.928 --> 20:24.896
This is what
I wanted you to see.

20:24.897 --> 20:27.899
[Latin music]

20:27.900 --> 20:29.801
- Huh.

20:29.802 --> 20:31.201
What's Marisa handing out?

20:31.202 --> 20:33.402
- Broad spectrum antibiotics.

20:33.403 --> 20:36.637
Cefixime, doxycycline,
azithromycin.

20:36.638 --> 20:38.138
- The shipment
my father signed for.

20:38.139 --> 20:40.974
- Yeah, the one I informed you
was not for my personal use.

20:40.975 --> 20:44.009
That was right before
you scolded me, I believe.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.312
- Yes, Richie, I know,

20:47.313 --> 20:48.747
But I hired you
to sell my house,

20:48.748 --> 20:51.516
Not to give it away.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.317
- Problematic Realtor?

20:53.318 --> 20:55.052
- Yes.

20:56.821 --> 20:58.255
- You want to talk about it?

20:58.256 --> 21:00.557
- Not even a little.

21:00.558 --> 21:01.624
So what brings you by?

21:01.625 --> 21:04.160
- Uh, well, I was, uh,

21:04.161 --> 21:06.096
I was just dropping off
some lab work.

21:06.097 --> 21:07.798
Figured I'd stop in...

21:07.799 --> 21:09.232
To say hi.

21:09.233 --> 21:11.068
- Hi.

21:13.237 --> 21:14.738
- Do you know
Dr. Emily peck?

21:14.739 --> 21:16.740
- Hmm.

21:16.741 --> 21:18.108
Doesn't ring a bell.

21:18.109 --> 21:20.844
- She just sort of
came out of nowhere.

21:20.845 --> 21:22.012
- Heh.

21:22.013 --> 21:24.047
No one comes out of nowhere.

21:24.048 --> 21:25.448
Okay.

21:25.449 --> 21:28.450
[typing]

21:28.451 --> 21:30.852
Dr. Emily peck, m.D.

21:30.853 --> 21:32.454
Uh, Princeton undergrad.

21:32.455 --> 21:35.524
Finished third in her class
at Johns Hopkins.

21:35.525 --> 21:37.259
Merit scholarship winner.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.461
Student board member,
amnesty international.

21:39.462 --> 21:40.929
You want I should go on?

21:40.930 --> 21:42.731
- No. I've got the picture.

21:42.732 --> 21:43.799
Thanks.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.802
- Does she want to buy a house?

21:46.803 --> 21:49.805
[soft Latin music]

21:49.806 --> 21:57.778
* *

22:16.929 --> 22:18.896
- She is smokin'.

22:18.897 --> 22:20.731
Like a cohiba.

22:20.732 --> 22:26.602
Yeah, nicely played, Boris.

22:26.603 --> 22:29.104
Whoa.

22:29.105 --> 22:32.007
Is Boris in a long-distance
relationship?

22:32.008 --> 22:34.342
- Yeah.

22:34.343 --> 22:37.077
With the woman trying
to save his life.

22:37.078 --> 22:39.646
- Oh.

22:39.647 --> 22:41.114
I thought that was you.

22:52.623 --> 22:55.425
Ah, the benefits
of concierge medicine.

22:55.426 --> 22:57.427
We should do all the tests.

22:57.428 --> 22:59.496
Right here in the hacienda, no?

23:04.402 --> 23:06.002
- Any questions before I begin?

23:06.003 --> 23:08.438
- No, I've had muscle biopsies
before, Hank.

23:08.439 --> 23:10.507
- Okay.

23:13.244 --> 23:16.280
- Something's on your mind.

23:16.281 --> 23:18.448
- That's the last test.

23:18.449 --> 23:20.851
You have to pass.

23:20.852 --> 23:22.286
There's a lot at stake here.

23:22.287 --> 23:23.720
- Yeah.

23:23.721 --> 23:26.490
Additionally, you saw me dance
with Marisa last night.

23:26.491 --> 23:27.724
It's raised
some concerns for you.

23:29.861 --> 23:32.296
- Since you brought it up...
Yes, it did.

23:32.297 --> 23:33.897
And while we're making a list,

23:33.898 --> 23:35.232
I'm not wild about the fact

23:35.233 --> 23:36.667
That you're funding
her research, either.

23:36.668 --> 23:38.301
But...

23:38.302 --> 23:40.904
Maybe you feel none of that

23:40.905 --> 23:43.940
Is my business.

23:43.941 --> 23:46.576
- Perhaps that's exactly
how I feel.

23:48.479 --> 23:50.880
- My sister works
in the factory, it's true.

23:50.881 --> 23:52.315
- I don't believe...
prove it.

23:54.820 --> 23:56.253
- Mm-hmm.

23:59.257 --> 24:00.657
- Oh, my God.

24:00.658 --> 24:02.225
- [laughing]

24:02.226 --> 24:03.493
- I feel like I just opened
the ark of the covenant.

24:03.494 --> 24:04.694
Like, I feel like
if I were an Nazi,

24:04.695 --> 24:06.495
My face would be
melting off right now.

24:06.496 --> 24:09.098
<i>Um, raiders of the lost ark.</i>

24:09.099 --> 24:10.599
- "I throw you the whip,
you throw me the idol."

24:10.600 --> 24:12.100
I get it.
- Yeah.

24:12.101 --> 24:13.735
Wow, nice.

24:13.736 --> 24:15.970
Okay...My friend.

24:15.971 --> 24:16.971
How many pesos?

24:16.972 --> 24:18.273
- Do you have dollars?

24:18.274 --> 24:20.508
- Evan!

24:20.509 --> 24:21.809
Hey.

24:21.810 --> 24:23.777
- Okay, uh, dude,

24:23.778 --> 24:24.845
Last time I saw this girl,

24:24.846 --> 24:26.346
I ended up with
a purse on my head.

24:26.347 --> 24:28.247
Doesn't matter, but I need
to man up right now,

24:28.248 --> 24:29.548
And I have to impress her.

24:29.549 --> 24:30.416
So if you know of like
a place I could...

24:30.417 --> 24:31.517
- Oh, hey.

24:31.518 --> 24:33.151
La arena y el mar.

24:33.152 --> 24:34.986
Great music place by the beach.

24:34.987 --> 24:36.521
Women love it,
and my sister Carmen

24:36.522 --> 24:37.922
Runs the bar there.

24:37.923 --> 24:39.657
- Thank you so much.

24:39.658 --> 24:41.525
You just said your sister
works at a cigar factory.

24:41.526 --> 24:43.093
- I have many sisters.

24:43.094 --> 24:44.928
- Okay. All right.
Don't go anywhere.

24:44.929 --> 24:46.363
- La arena y el mar.

24:46.364 --> 24:48.298
- La arena y el mar.
Thanks, dude.

24:49.766 --> 24:50.967
- Hi.

24:50.968 --> 24:52.768
I was hoping I'd see you again.

24:52.769 --> 24:54.337
You look so much better.

24:54.338 --> 24:56.874
- Uh, I'm so sorry.
Do I know you?

24:56.875 --> 24:59.809
'cause...Ugh,
this is so weird.

24:59.810 --> 25:03.145
Due to a thunderous blow
to the head yesterday,

25:03.146 --> 25:04.713
I'm suffering from memory loss.

25:04.714 --> 25:06.347
- It's me, Mindy.

25:06.348 --> 25:08.249
- Mindy. That's a really
nice name... Mindy.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.349
Mindy, Mindy.

25:09.350 --> 25:11.185
Canadian?

25:11.186 --> 25:12.987
[both laugh]

25:12.988 --> 25:14.121
- Mindy! Mindy!

25:14.122 --> 25:16.156
Come over here.

25:16.157 --> 25:20.126
- So how 'bout like
an authentic Cuban bar tonight?

25:20.127 --> 25:21.394
- I'm sorry, I...
I'd love to,

25:21.395 --> 25:23.195
But I... my friends and I
have to do this thing and...

25:23.196 --> 25:24.229
- Oh. Okay.

25:24.230 --> 25:27.531
Well, what...
I like...Things, if...

25:27.532 --> 25:29.566
- Sorry, I gotta go.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.401
Sorry.
Good to see you, though.

25:35.939 --> 25:38.973
- Uh, la arena y el mar

25:38.974 --> 25:41.209
Is the name of the club.

25:41.210 --> 25:43.178
If you're near the beach.

25:43.179 --> 25:44.513
Or not.

25:46.683 --> 25:49.851
- Okay, so...
Sorry, what was your name?

25:49.852 --> 25:51.086
- Oscar.
- Oscar, all right.

25:51.087 --> 25:53.788
Let me see how much
money I have.

25:53.789 --> 25:55.957
Or don't have, for that matter.

25:58.226 --> 25:59.693
- You're a doctor?

25:59.694 --> 26:01.194
- Why, would you charge me
even more if I was?

26:02.697 --> 26:04.565
Okay...

26:04.566 --> 26:06.233
This is my final offer.

26:06.234 --> 26:07.468
And I'm only doing this

26:07.469 --> 26:09.536
Because you're familiar
with Indiana Jones.

26:09.537 --> 26:11.305
- You want to trade a phone
for cigars?

26:11.306 --> 26:12.541
- Are you kidding me?

26:12.542 --> 26:15.545
This has a 3.8 inch
touch screen display.

26:15.546 --> 26:19.014
5 megapixel camera, 500
megahertz of processing power.

26:19.015 --> 26:21.282
And if you don't want it,
the offer ends in ten,

26:21.283 --> 26:22.450
Nine, eight...

26:22.451 --> 26:24.051
- Okay, okay, okay.

26:26.455 --> 26:29.625
<i>- Thank you.
Gracias, senor.</i>

26:29.626 --> 26:31.628
It's been a pleasure.
- Walk away, walk away.

26:31.629 --> 26:33.463
Go. Hurry.

26:39.437 --> 26:41.437
- Your MRI showed no sign
of aneurysm,

26:41.438 --> 26:43.639
Inflammation, or hydrocephalus.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.407
So all tumors are ruled out.

26:45.408 --> 26:46.975
Everything is normal.

26:46.976 --> 26:48.844
- I don't feel normal.

26:48.845 --> 26:50.679
I have this relentless pain
I can't get rid of.

26:50.680 --> 26:52.847
Do you understand
what that's like?

26:52.848 --> 26:55.617
- Yes, I believe I do.

26:55.618 --> 26:57.285
- Yeah, unfortunately,
tension migraines

26:57.286 --> 26:59.087
Take several days to pass.

26:59.088 --> 27:00.655
These injections should help.

27:00.656 --> 27:02.690
- Botox for headaches?

27:02.691 --> 27:05.292
- It's called indelatox.

27:05.293 --> 27:07.494
Like Botox, but even better.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.929
- Why stop there?

27:08.930 --> 27:10.597
Maybe you could cure my gas
with a tummy tuck.

27:10.598 --> 27:13.066
- Heh. It's unorthodox.

27:13.067 --> 27:14.701
But, trust me, it works.

27:14.702 --> 27:16.670
- Yeah, nothing says
pain relief

27:16.671 --> 27:18.104
Like getting jammed
with a needle.

27:18.105 --> 27:19.239
- [chuckles]

27:19.240 --> 27:20.874
- Whoa!

27:20.875 --> 27:23.343
Isn't the forehead injection
for wrinkles?

27:23.344 --> 27:26.913
- No. No. That's part
of the migraine treatment.

27:26.914 --> 27:29.115
But since you asked...

27:29.116 --> 27:32.118
You still have
about 50 units left.

27:32.119 --> 27:35.288
You want me to erase
some of those fine lines?

27:35.289 --> 27:36.923
- Not to contradict
Dr. Peck...

27:36.924 --> 27:41.761
But hankmed does not do or
recommend cosmetic procedures.

27:41.762 --> 27:44.932
- When you look good,
you feel good, right?

27:44.933 --> 27:46.600
It is totally your call.

27:46.601 --> 27:48.702
- Go easy, doc.

27:48.703 --> 27:50.337
I don't want to get mistaken
for Mickey Rourke.

27:50.338 --> 27:52.105
- Mm.

27:52.106 --> 27:53.306
Okay.

27:53.307 --> 27:55.109
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:55.110 --> 27:56.978
Hank!

27:56.979 --> 27:58.312
- Your lab results.

27:58.313 --> 27:59.280
They just arrived
from the institute.

27:59.281 --> 28:00.681
- And...

28:00.682 --> 28:01.849
- You're considered
a strong candidate

28:01.850 --> 28:03.117
For the clinical trial.

28:03.118 --> 28:04.551
- Good.

28:06.321 --> 28:08.722
[speaks Spanish]

28:08.723 --> 28:10.558
So...

28:10.559 --> 28:13.128
You schedule the bone marrow
aspiration for tomorrow?

28:13.129 --> 28:14.663
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:14.664 --> 28:16.564
I like aspirating bone marrow
as much as the next guy,

28:16.565 --> 28:18.733
But let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

28:18.734 --> 28:21.134
- Well, the first step
is stem cell extraction, yeah?

28:21.135 --> 28:22.569
- For the trial, yes.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.171
But my first step would be
to locate and interview

28:24.172 --> 28:25.572
Past participants.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.140
- All three of them?

28:27.141 --> 28:28.742
- Look, I found
similar studies in Europe.

28:28.743 --> 28:29.976
We should do private reviews.

28:29.977 --> 28:31.745
And I want to follow
standard protocol

28:31.746 --> 28:33.046
And enlist a research committee

28:33.047 --> 28:34.381
To assess this trial.

28:34.382 --> 28:35.983
- Protocol, committee...
Hank, what you're talking about

28:35.984 --> 28:37.150
Would take weeks, months.

28:37.151 --> 28:38.485
No, I brought you
down here to...

28:38.486 --> 28:40.053
- Protect you.

28:40.054 --> 28:42.589
My plan will do that.

28:42.590 --> 28:44.090
Without the same risk
of infection, stroke,

28:44.091 --> 28:45.057
Heart and kidney failure.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.992
The list goes on and on.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.593
Boris, it was only a few weeks
ago you nearly went blind

28:48.594 --> 28:50.194
Pursuing an ill-advised
treatment.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.528
- That was fear.
This is medicine.

28:51.529 --> 28:52.762
- Which is why I'm not saying
don't do this.

28:52.763 --> 28:54.397
I'm just saying
don't do this now.

28:54.398 --> 28:57.666
Your levels are okay.
You're not symptomatic.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.167
You feel fine.

28:59.168 --> 29:01.770
Participating in this
unproven trial

29:01.771 --> 29:03.003
Could change all that.

29:03.004 --> 29:05.005
And this time, I won't
be here to help.

29:05.006 --> 29:06.740
Look, you've already
outlived your father

29:06.741 --> 29:07.907
And your grandfather.

29:07.908 --> 29:09.408
You're ahead of the game.

29:09.409 --> 29:11.577
Let's keep you there.

29:11.578 --> 29:13.378
- Well, your plan is thorough.

29:13.379 --> 29:16.981
And reasonable.
It makes sense.

29:16.982 --> 29:18.182
Thank you, Hank.

29:18.183 --> 29:20.117
- Sure. Okay.

29:29.662 --> 29:32.297
- So I don't want to worry you.

29:32.298 --> 29:35.166
But, uh, there's a slight
possibility

29:35.167 --> 29:37.233
That the Cuban government

29:37.234 --> 29:38.601
Might be following me.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.002
- Yeah, I can't imagine anyone

29:40.003 --> 29:41.871
Showing that level
of interest in you

29:41.872 --> 29:44.339
- I...
[chuckles]

29:44.340 --> 29:45.640
I have to pee.

29:45.641 --> 29:46.741
- Okay.

29:46.742 --> 29:48.676
- Watch my bag.

29:48.677 --> 29:51.245
- I'm watchin' it.

30:00.921 --> 30:01.988
Hi.

30:01.989 --> 30:03.989
- I was hoping you'd say that.

30:03.990 --> 30:05.222
- Oh.

30:05.223 --> 30:06.456
- You were staring at me.

30:06.457 --> 30:08.758
- I was hoping
you'd notice that.

30:08.759 --> 30:10.459
- You're American.

30:10.460 --> 30:13.528
- And it's come between us
already.

30:13.529 --> 30:15.063
- Do you want
something to drink?

30:15.064 --> 30:18.167
- Where I'm from,
the man buys, so...

30:18.168 --> 30:20.169
- Yeah.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.941
What will it be?

30:25.942 --> 30:29.309
<i>- Okay, uh, uh...
mojitos, dos, por favor.</i>

30:29.310 --> 30:32.312
Okay, look, so...

30:32.313 --> 30:34.080
I know that you just want
to decompress

30:34.081 --> 30:35.481
Or whatever, okay?
- Okay.

30:35.482 --> 30:37.083
- But this is our last night
on a beautiful island.

30:37.084 --> 30:39.018
We're probably never gonna
be here again, right?

30:39.019 --> 30:42.422
We have a few hours for all
the hedonism we can manage

30:42.423 --> 30:43.490
Under a communist regime...

30:43.491 --> 30:46.593
- Okay.
Let's enjoy this.

30:46.594 --> 30:47.594
- Wh-what?

30:47.595 --> 30:48.595
- Yeah.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.030
- Compliments from the woman

30:50.031 --> 30:51.731
Who was checking you out
earlier.

30:51.732 --> 30:53.901
- Well, that's very nice.
You'll have to thank her for me.

30:53.902 --> 30:55.669
- Dude, who was
checking you out?

30:55.670 --> 30:58.373
- To sending ourselves off,

30:58.374 --> 30:59.774
Cubano style.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.377
- Yeah, um...

31:02.378 --> 31:04.113
Godspeed, and good luck.

31:04.114 --> 31:05.648
- Wai-wai-wait.
You're leaving?

31:05.649 --> 31:08.184
- Sorry, bro.
Canada's calling.

31:08.185 --> 31:09.486
- Doctor!

31:09.487 --> 31:10.821
- Oh, no, I'm not a doctor.

31:10.822 --> 31:11.989
- Susie needs your help.

31:11.990 --> 31:13.157
- Wh-what is it?
- Come on.

31:16.495 --> 31:18.063
- I cannot believe
this is happening.

31:18.064 --> 31:19.832
- What did she do?
- It's what she had done.

31:19.833 --> 31:22.535
Chin implants, neck lipo.

31:22.536 --> 31:24.337
- Breast lift... everything
that needed to be fixed.

31:24.338 --> 31:26.673
- This third-world butcher
totally screwed her up.

31:26.674 --> 31:27.674
Will she be okay?

31:27.675 --> 31:29.409
- Her pulse rate's over 120.

31:29.410 --> 31:31.011
Low-grade fever.

31:31.012 --> 31:32.646
Any pain here?
- Ahh!

31:32.647 --> 31:34.215
- Okay, move over.
Move over.

31:34.216 --> 31:35.316
Get in, guys, get in.

31:35.317 --> 31:37.884
¡Al hospital más
cercano, rápido!

31:45.505 --> 31:48.280
- Through there.

31:48.281 --> 31:50.254
- Dr. José Ávila.
- Dr. Hank Lawson.

31:50.255 --> 31:52.094
Tenemos Una mujer De
29 años De edad.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.928
Demuestra haberse sometido
a varias cirujías estéticas.

31:55.297 --> 31:56.330
- [gasping]
it hurts to breathe.

31:56.331 --> 32:01.000
Inicialmente... Debe ser Una embolia pulmonar
y hacerle UN estudio De ventilación pulmonar.

32:01.334 --> 32:03.034
- For a pulmonary embolism?

32:03.035 --> 32:04.202
Wouldn't you rather get
a ct angiogram?

32:04.203 --> 32:05.770
- Oh, you speak engli...
okay.

32:05.771 --> 32:06.971
Uh, yeah, ct angiogram.

32:06.972 --> 32:08.305
- No.

32:08.306 --> 32:09.540
- This is as far
as I can go, Susie.

32:09.541 --> 32:10.741
- No, please, Hank.
Stay with me. Don't...

32:10.742 --> 32:12.276
- Look, I don't have
any privileges here.

32:12.277 --> 32:13.978
Please, Susie,
just let them help.

32:13.979 --> 32:15.379
- Relatives are allowed, right?

32:15.380 --> 32:18.482
Hank's her fourth cousin.
By marriage.

32:18.483 --> 32:19.717
A couple times removed.

32:19.718 --> 32:20.685
- It works for me.
Let's go.

32:20.686 --> 32:22.487
- Great, nice.
Thank you. Let's go!

32:25.091 --> 32:29.627
- Ct images show no clot.

32:29.628 --> 32:35.399
- [speaking Spanish]

32:35.400 --> 32:37.702
- Your medical Spanish
is very good.

32:37.703 --> 32:38.736
- Comes with the territory

32:38.737 --> 32:41.305
When you work
in a Brooklyn hospital.

32:41.306 --> 32:42.940
- Her surgery records.

32:46.245 --> 32:47.945
I don't see any complications.

32:47.946 --> 32:50.514
- No, but there's
still a chance

32:50.515 --> 32:53.684
Of a peripheral blood clot
or m.I.

32:53.685 --> 32:56.186
- [coughing]

33:01.062 --> 33:03.431
- Susie...

33:03.432 --> 33:05.399
You okay?

33:05.400 --> 33:06.400
- [coughing continues]

33:06.401 --> 33:07.668
- You're warm to the touch.

33:07.669 --> 33:09.336
- Yeah, my whole upper body's
burning up.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.707
- Ugh.

33:13.708 --> 33:14.940
Okay.

33:14.941 --> 33:16.075
[door opens]

33:16.076 --> 33:17.710
- It looks like
the anesthesiologist

33:17.711 --> 33:20.746
Increased oxygenation towards
the end of the procedure.

33:20.747 --> 33:22.614
- Susie, have you
been scuba diving?

33:22.615 --> 33:24.082
- This morning.

33:24.083 --> 33:25.283
- How many hours
before the surgery?

33:25.284 --> 33:28.587
- At least six.
Does that matter?

33:28.588 --> 33:30.088
- You have
decompression sickness.

33:30.089 --> 33:31.690
- A.K.A. The bends.

33:31.691 --> 33:34.192
It's what happens when divers
surface too quickly.

33:34.193 --> 33:37.160
See, nitrogen bubbles
form in the blood and tissue.

33:37.161 --> 33:39.028
My guess is that you didn't
do a proper safety stop

33:39.029 --> 33:40.463
At the end of your dive.

33:40.464 --> 33:43.767
- I got separated from the group
and came up on my own.

33:43.768 --> 33:45.203
I don't understand.

33:45.204 --> 33:47.105
I felt fine all day.

33:47.106 --> 33:48.440
- It can take several hours

33:48.441 --> 33:49.774
For symptoms
like this rash to appear.

33:49.775 --> 33:51.610
What you need now
is an oxygen treatment.

33:51.611 --> 33:54.045
Where's the closest
hyperbaric chamber?

33:54.046 --> 33:55.781
- Second floor.
- Okay, let's go.

33:57.317 --> 34:00.585
[distant shouting,
glass shatters]

34:02.388 --> 34:03.421
- Hey. Oh!

34:03.422 --> 34:04.756
- Oh, hi.

34:04.757 --> 34:06.825
- Your brother said Susie's
gonna be okay.

34:06.826 --> 34:09.728
So...Thank you.

34:09.728 --> 34:10.829
- I don't know what I did,

34:10.830 --> 34:13.231
But you're very welcome.

34:13.232 --> 34:16.000
- And I'm very sorry
for being so vague.

34:16.001 --> 34:18.603
They made Susie sign something.

34:18.603 --> 34:20.637
You must think
I'm a total nut job.

34:20.638 --> 34:22.806
- No. Um, I mean,

34:22.806 --> 34:24.974
Most women run away after
they've gotten to know me,

34:24.975 --> 34:26.409
Not before.

34:26.409 --> 34:28.110
So, yeah, I just assumed

34:28.112 --> 34:29.978
That you'd kind of lost
interest.

34:29.980 --> 34:33.014
- Well, I figured, "there's
no way this guy could like me.

34:33.014 --> 34:36.618
"I mean, I almost cracked
his skull open and...

34:36.619 --> 34:38.652
"now he's wearing...

34:38.652 --> 34:40.520
Part of a tote bag
on his head."

34:40.521 --> 34:42.022
- Whoa, well, you see,
I loved your story

34:42.023 --> 34:43.623
Until you mentioned
the word "tote."

34:43.623 --> 34:45.690
- Let's talk about
more important things.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.193
- Yes, let's.
Like what?

34:47.194 --> 34:49.462
- Susie's gonna be resting
for a few days,

34:49.463 --> 34:50.663
And Carrie can keep
an eye on her.

34:50.664 --> 34:52.665
So I'm gonna have
some free time.

34:52.666 --> 34:55.467
You know, we could...
Go zip lining.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.370
Horseback riding.

34:57.371 --> 35:00.272
Or we could start a revolution.

35:02.376 --> 35:04.005
- [sighs]

35:04.006 --> 35:05.505
I leave in the morning.

35:05.506 --> 35:08.774
- Can't change your flight?

35:08.775 --> 35:12.443
- I doubt it.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.146
Technically,
I'm not even here, anyway.

35:17.315 --> 35:19.783
- Well, then, technically,
this never happened.

35:35.328 --> 35:36.862
- Yeah.

35:41.801 --> 35:44.502
- Ah. The younger son
also rises.

35:44.503 --> 35:46.336
- [whispering] oh, dude,
you have no idea.

35:46.337 --> 35:47.703
- Why are you whispering?

35:47.704 --> 35:49.203
- So sorry I can't
stay for breakfa...

35:49.204 --> 35:50.704
- Oh...

35:50.705 --> 35:51.805
Hi, Hank.

35:51.806 --> 35:53.873
- Mindy.
Cute shirt.

35:53.874 --> 35:56.005
- Thanks.

35:58.742 --> 36:00.309
Mm.

36:00.310 --> 36:01.376
Cute brother.

36:01.377 --> 36:03.312
- Thanks.

36:03.313 --> 36:05.246
You...Slut.

36:05.247 --> 36:06.681
- Actually, I'll have you know,

36:06.682 --> 36:08.849
Mindy and I had a very
meaningful vacationship.

36:08.850 --> 36:10.251
- A "vacationship"?

36:10.252 --> 36:11.485
- Apparently
it's a relationship

36:11.486 --> 36:12.352
With no strings
and no smalltalk.

36:12.353 --> 36:14.988
Her suggestion.
I was amenable.

36:14.989 --> 36:16.656
When in Cuba, I guess...

36:16.657 --> 36:17.723
- Speaking of,
the plane awaits.

36:17.724 --> 36:19.524
I'm sorry, I mean the jet.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.727
- Nice. I-I-I wish I had
a little bit more time.

36:22.728 --> 36:24.094
- More time in bed?

36:24.095 --> 36:25.729
- Yeah, in bed, in Cuba,
with Mindy.

36:25.730 --> 36:26.730
I'm... I'm...

36:26.731 --> 36:28.065
Why am I going back again?

36:28.066 --> 36:29.232
- Because, contrary
to public perception,

36:29.233 --> 36:30.600
You have a job.

36:30.601 --> 36:32.502
- Ah, God, I hate
when you're right.

36:32.503 --> 36:34.370
- But you'll always
have the memories.

36:34.371 --> 36:36.839
- I hope you framed out
my trauma wound.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.073
- I didn't.
Get dressed, Ev.

36:38.074 --> 36:39.240
We gotta go, now.

36:39.241 --> 36:40.942
- Whoa, wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa.

36:40.943 --> 36:44.111
Okay...I just had a vision.

36:44.112 --> 36:45.713
- We're not starting
a hankmed franchise down here.

36:45.714 --> 36:46.914
- I need to trade your phone

36:46.915 --> 36:48.182
For another box
of Montecristos.

36:48.183 --> 36:49.883
- Oh, how many cigars
can you smoke?

36:49.884 --> 36:51.919
- They're not for me.
They're for our top ten clients.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.754
Megur merchandising
can probably create

36:53.755 --> 36:55.622
A little cigar band that
says "hankmed" on it.

36:55.623 --> 36:56.923
- You want to market
our healthcare business

36:56.924 --> 36:58.124
Using illegal carcinogens.

36:58.125 --> 37:00.426
- No, I want to reward
our most loyal patients

37:00.427 --> 37:01.526
Using a status symbol.

37:01.527 --> 37:03.061
- My cell phone
is not legal tender.

37:03.062 --> 37:04.228
- Yes, it is.

37:04.229 --> 37:05.396
In fact... okay, look.
- But...

37:05.397 --> 37:06.397
- I'm gonna buy you a new phone

37:06.398 --> 37:07.598
The second we get back.

37:07.599 --> 37:08.766
Don't let Boris
leave without me.

37:08.767 --> 37:10.534
I love you.
- I'm a...Doctor.

37:10.535 --> 37:11.934
I need a phone.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.359
We get double miles
on every purchase.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.462
- What...

37:36.463 --> 37:37.997
You changed your mind.

37:37.998 --> 37:41.868
- No, Hank, I...
Made a decision.

37:41.869 --> 37:43.270
<i>UN memento, por favor.</i>

37:46.207 --> 37:49.176
<i>Gracias, Marisa.</i>

37:49.177 --> 37:51.778
- What happened to my plan
being thorough...

37:51.779 --> 37:52.946
Reasonable...

37:52.947 --> 37:54.413
And making sense?

37:54.414 --> 37:56.679
- It was, but Marisa's plan
also made sense.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.013
So I had to make a choice.

37:59.014 --> 38:01.415
Follow her advice
and increase the risk

38:01.416 --> 38:03.817
Or follow your advice
and delay the benefit.

38:03.818 --> 38:05.519
I chose to do something

38:05.520 --> 38:07.053
As opposed to wait
for something.

38:07.054 --> 38:09.322
You know me by now, Hank.

38:09.323 --> 38:11.023
You're not really
surprised, are you?

38:11.024 --> 38:12.491
- What I am is concerned.

38:12.492 --> 38:14.793
- Stay here, then,
through the clinical trial.

38:14.794 --> 38:16.895
Monitor my reactions

38:16.896 --> 38:18.629
And allay your concerns.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.700
- I'm sorry.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.235
I won't assist
a course of treatment

38:25.236 --> 38:26.970
I don't yet support.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.074
We need to talk!

38:33.075 --> 38:35.409
- I will not convince him
to quit my trial...

38:35.410 --> 38:36.610
To postpone his treatment

38:36.611 --> 38:38.145
Until you feel
comfortable with it.

38:38.146 --> 38:41.448
- Look, it's clear
you still love him.

38:47.419 --> 38:49.720
- I wrote him for many years

38:49.721 --> 38:51.755
After he left.

38:51.756 --> 38:54.224
He never answered my letters.

38:56.093 --> 38:59.095
Now, thanks to you,
I am his doctor again.

38:59.096 --> 39:02.564
Is it ideal?
No.

39:02.565 --> 39:04.099
But I can help him.

39:06.268 --> 39:07.802
- We can both help him.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.070
Together.

39:09.071 --> 39:11.673
- It seems like
he's already made his choice.

39:11.674 --> 39:14.075
I think he has
a new quarterback.

39:14.076 --> 39:16.277
Good-bye, Dr. Lawson.

39:26.020 --> 39:28.086
[door slams]

39:28.087 --> 39:29.251
- Hank.

39:29.252 --> 39:32.120
Finally.

39:32.121 --> 39:33.555
- Oh, I can't stay.

39:33.556 --> 39:35.090
I just, uh, I'm playing
doubles with

39:35.091 --> 39:36.525
Alan and his wife
at the maidstone.

39:36.526 --> 39:38.059
I wanted to give you that.

39:38.060 --> 39:40.860
Oh, and by the way,
Alan feels better.

39:40.861 --> 39:42.061
And younger too.

39:42.062 --> 39:44.130
- I don't transcribe
patients' notes.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.132
Hank likes
to handle that himself.

39:46.133 --> 39:47.567
- Oh, you, him, whoever.

39:47.568 --> 39:51.036
Uh, I just need a hard copy
and the recorder back by 5:00.

39:51.037 --> 39:54.206
Oh, and I forgot.

39:54.207 --> 39:56.041
- What could this
possibly be for?

39:56.042 --> 39:58.109
- For the next time
you guys need backup.

39:58.110 --> 39:59.376
You can call me direct.

40:00.712 --> 40:01.745
- Dr. Peck...

40:08.586 --> 40:10.220
Schmoozing patients...

40:10.221 --> 40:12.956
And pushing spa treatments
on them...

40:12.957 --> 40:16.126
Are simply not hallmarks
of being professional.

40:16.127 --> 40:18.662
And professionalism
is what this thing

40:18.663 --> 40:20.630
Is all about.

40:20.631 --> 40:22.300
So thank you.

40:22.301 --> 40:24.102
But if I were you,

40:24.103 --> 40:25.603
I wouldn't wait by the phone.

40:28.140 --> 40:30.341
- I shouldn't keep
the ryders waiting.

40:33.612 --> 40:35.747
- I like your ride, by the way.

40:35.748 --> 40:39.317
- Oh, it's an efficient
means of transport.

40:39.318 --> 40:40.718
- Well, time
is important to you.

40:40.719 --> 40:43.154
- Time is important
to everyone, Hank.

40:43.155 --> 40:47.792
But, yes, it's especially
important to me.

40:47.793 --> 40:49.661
I'm sorry you won't be staying.

40:49.662 --> 40:52.264
- I'm sorry you
won't be leaving.

40:52.265 --> 40:54.032
But I hope you're right,

40:54.033 --> 40:55.200
And that everything works out.

40:55.201 --> 40:56.367
I really do.

40:56.368 --> 40:58.336
- I don't know
how long this will take

40:58.337 --> 40:59.537
Or when I'll be back.

40:59.538 --> 41:02.640
But I'll...
Keep you posted.

41:02.641 --> 41:04.441
- Good.
And I'll keep searching.

41:04.442 --> 41:05.976
A cure is out there.

41:05.977 --> 41:08.878
You know, if not here,
somewhere.

41:08.879 --> 41:11.547
And if you need anything just...
- don't worry.

41:11.548 --> 41:14.617
I'll have you renditioned.

41:14.618 --> 41:15.684
Again.

41:15.685 --> 41:17.152
<i>Adios, Hank.</i>

41:17.153 --> 41:19.220
<i>- Adios.</i>

41:19.221 --> 41:21.823
[engines humming]

41:21.824 --> 41:23.625
- Good morning, Dr. Lawson.

41:23.626 --> 41:25.193
- Good morning.

41:25.194 --> 41:26.360
- Something to drink?

41:26.361 --> 41:28.162
- Uh, just water, thanks, Ria.

41:28.163 --> 41:30.197
- Sure.
- Hey, have you seen my brother?

41:30.198 --> 41:31.365
- You're the first to arrive.

41:41.274 --> 41:43.675
- Hey, uh, um...

41:43.676 --> 41:45.977
<i>¿Dónde Esta Oscar?</i>

41:45.978 --> 41:49.013
Oscar, um, he's a tall guy.

41:49.014 --> 41:50.081
Red hair.

41:53.486 --> 41:57.226
[bell tolling]

42:02.832 --> 42:04.967
[tires screech]

42:04.968 --> 42:06.768
¡Oye tú, para!

42:06.769 --> 42:09.071
- Whoa!
Okay, okay. Guys, guys.

42:09.072 --> 42:11.106
¡Apúrate!

42:11.107 --> 42:13.708
- You don't have
to do this, okay?

42:13.709 --> 42:16.794
Vamos, vamos, vamos, vamos.
