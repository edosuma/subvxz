00:43.844 --> 00:48.814
<i>I was born in the summer of 1977
in Los Angeles, California.</i>

00:48.816 --> 00:52.418
<i>My father, John Kinney, received the
news of my birth two days later</i>

00:52.420 --> 00:55.487
<i>when a telegram reached him
on the Greek island of Mykonos,</i>

00:55.489 --> 00:57.189
<i>where he was directing a film.</i>

00:57.191 --> 00:59.525
<i>He said it had
just started raining,</i>

00:59.527 --> 01:02.428
<i>and the telegram arrived sopping
wet and written in Greek.</i>

01:02.430 --> 01:04.830
<i>The film's camera operator
translated.</i>

01:04.831 --> 01:08.233
<i>"Congratulations!
She's six pounds, 12 ounces,</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:10.235
<i>and her name is Alice."</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:12.704
<i>I'm told so much champagne
popped that night</i>

01:12.706 --> 01:14.239
<i>it sounded like fireworks.</i>

01:22.615 --> 01:26.685
<i>My father made personal films that
captured the spirit of his generation.</i>

01:26.687 --> 01:28.353
<i>He found the truth
in the bedroom,</i>

01:28.355 --> 01:30.222
<i>the agony in love,</i>

01:30.224 --> 01:31.957
<i>and the humor in it all.</i>

01:33.560 --> 01:35.260
<i>In my father's obituary,</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:37.796
<i>the</i> New York times
<i>called him a "comic poet,"</i>

01:37.798 --> 01:42.067
<i>a sentiment, I assure you, no one
would have loved more than him.</i>

01:42.069 --> 01:46.438
<i>My dad's work brought him
great joy, respect and success.</i>

01:46.440 --> 01:49.374
<i>And with that success,
he bought this car</i>

01:49.376 --> 01:52.544
<i>and this house, where I lived every
other weekend of my childhood.</i>

01:54.314 --> 01:57.883
<i>My dad's personal life
was a little less of a success.</i>

01:57.885 --> 02:00.786
<i>He married several women.</i>

02:00.788 --> 02:03.122
<i>And lived with several more.</i>

02:03.124 --> 02:07.526
<i>But he was the first to admit the end of
his affairs was always entirely his fault.</i>

02:09.229 --> 02:11.897
<i>This was certainly the case
with his last wife,</i>

02:11.899 --> 02:13.532
<i>my beautiful mother, Lilian.</i>

02:14.968 --> 02:18.003
<i>My mother was 22 years old
when she met my dad,</i>

02:18.005 --> 02:20.772
<i>which made her
26 years his junior.</i>

02:20.774 --> 02:24.143
<i>Theirs was a real "hold on
to your hat" kind of love,</i>

02:24.145 --> 02:26.411
<i>a love that would never last.</i>

02:27.947 --> 02:31.316
<i>My parents divorced
soon after my fourth birthday.</i>

02:31.318 --> 02:33.585
<i>Unfortunately for my mother,</i>

02:33.587 --> 02:35.587
<i>this inspired some
of my dad's best work.</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:39.091
<i>But he said it was me</i>

02:39.093 --> 02:41.193
<i>who completed his third act.</i>

02:41.195 --> 02:44.930
<i>My dad wasn't very sentimental,
but he always loved my birthday.</i>

02:44.932 --> 02:47.099
<i>Every year,
he'd say the same thing.</i>

02:47.101 --> 02:49.434
<i>"This is your day.
Your year.</i>

02:49.436 --> 02:53.472
<i>Get ready, Alice.
The future is yours."</i>

03:01.948 --> 03:04.116
- Mom?
- Mom, are you in there?

03:04.118 --> 03:05.851
Yeah, just a sec.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.788
Mom, remember the drought!

03:09.790 --> 03:11.623
Oh, yeah.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.794
- Mom, open up!
- Open the door!

03:15.796 --> 03:16.962
I'm coming.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.232
Happy birthday!

03:20.234 --> 03:22.000
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.403
Come here. Mmm.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.171
Mom, is everything okay?

03:26.173 --> 03:28.173
Yeah. I'm great.

03:28.175 --> 03:31.510
It's my birthday.
And I love you both so much.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.811
Okay, who wants pancakes?

03:32.813 --> 03:34.546
I do!
I do!

03:34.548 --> 03:37.216
So, girls, how are we feeling?

03:37.218 --> 03:39.685
First day, new school.
You nervous? You excited?

03:39.687 --> 03:41.153
Excited. Definitely.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.821
Nervous. Extremely.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.524
Wait. Can kids
have heart attacks?

03:45.526 --> 03:48.260
Oh, my gosh, honey, no.
But I understand.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.396
This is a big deal. Do you want
to listen to your favorite song?

03:51.398 --> 03:53.198
Or maybe we
could go over your schedule

03:53.200 --> 03:54.600
and talk about
what's making you anxious.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.035
I don't wanna do
that doctor's stupid exercises.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.339
Can't I just go on antidepressants
like every other kid?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.874
Oh, my god. Isabel. For the billionth
time, you are not depressed.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.676
- I'm positive.
- Please, mom?

04:04.678 --> 04:08.080
You know, I'm feeling exhausted,
hopeless, anxious,

04:08.082 --> 04:11.016
and I don't enjoy the things
that I once loved.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.451
Music, please!

04:12.453 --> 04:14.052
I'm not alone, you know.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.053
Depression affects
over 20 million Americans,

04:16.055 --> 04:18.123
and I'm an American, so...

04:18.125 --> 04:21.125
- Where are you getting this from?
- The Zoloft commercial.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.961
Obviously.
Okay, IZ,

04:22.963 --> 04:24.763
you're being
a little bit dramatic.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.765
- You're gonna walk into
first period... -oh, no!

04:26.767 --> 04:29.268
- What? What did you forget?
- My summer reading book report.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.970
Oh, god.
Okay. It's no big deal.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.939
I'm gonna drop you guys
off at school,

04:33.941 --> 04:36.475
and I'll go back to the house and
bring it to you, okay, honey?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.443
- But please try and be more responsible.
- I'm working on it.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.045
Okay.
It's okay.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.147
E-mail it to me, and I can
print it out in the library.

04:42.149 --> 04:46.752
- See? -Well, assuming I
have time and they let me.

04:48.821 --> 04:50.255
Okay, this is it.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.657
Wow!

04:51.659 --> 04:53.825
This is gonna be great.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.595
Look at this. It is so much prettier
than your school in New York.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.298
It has trees and sunshine.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.467
Look at that cool mural. Okay,
you want me to walk you in?

05:02.469 --> 05:05.270
- No!
- Got it. Unanimous.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.172
All right. Don't forget
that after school,

05:07.174 --> 05:09.241
we're gonna have a little birthday
celebration with ice cream,

05:09.243 --> 05:11.677
and then tonight you guys are
sleeping over at Nanna's house.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.845
Can you tell Nanna
I go to bed at 9:00 now?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.947
I think it's 8:45, Missy.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.616
But, yes, I will tell her.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.750
Love you.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.819
Love you, honey.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.387
Have a good day.
I will.

05:23.423 --> 05:24.489
Hi, welcome.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.657
Hi.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.261
Isabel?

05:29.263 --> 05:32.364
You got this. You've got
a great first day outfit.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.499
You're hilarious.
You're brilliant.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.967
You're cool.
You're a city kid.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.336
Mom...

05:37.338 --> 05:39.538
You're gonna be great.
I promise.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.273
I guess.

05:41.275 --> 05:43.508
But right now,
I just wanna go home.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.778
- It's okay. You're gonna be home before
you know it. -I meant to New York.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.616
Happy birthday, mom.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.151
Thanks, sweetie.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.422
Have fun!

06:00.960 --> 06:03.495
Hollywood boulevard is famous
for the walk of fame.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.897
It has the different stars...
Your payment is late.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.000
I hear you. But all we need is another
five hours. Let us keep the stuff here.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.137
We'll figure out the money, and we'll
get it to you. It won't be a problem.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.840
I'm not running a charity here.
You have to leave now.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.242
Okay. You know what, Rajeesh?
We're talking in circles.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.811
We paid the first two weeks. We didn't
think we'd be here for a third.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.847
But if you give us until
tonight, it's all gonna be good.

06:21.849 --> 06:24.316
Get out. Now! Go!

06:24.318 --> 06:26.918
Okay. I have to say I think you
are being incredibly difficult,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.520
maybe even slightly irrational.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.055
What are you doing?
What is that?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.324
So now I am calling the police.
The pol... oh.

06:35.194 --> 06:38.330
So? So I gotta get changed
or we're gonna be late.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.432
What'd he say? What happened?
He's a maniac.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.234
Indians never like me.
Okay.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.736
Teddy, you packed? Oh, sorry.
Thought you said you had a plan.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.605
- You are looking at it.
- George, enough.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.007
We need to focus on our meeting.
Let's go over the pitch.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.077
Teddy, should we run lines? I think it could
be good to act out some bits in the room.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.912
I'll play Sam.
You play Jane.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.181
- But I'm playing Sam in the movie.
- Oh. Fine.

06:56.183 --> 06:59.684
- I'll play Jane then. -Let's just
make sure we stick to our guns, okay?

06:59.686 --> 07:01.686
I've heard horror stories
about great scripts

07:01.688 --> 07:04.623
getting totally dismantled
by these kinds of people.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.792
Aren't these people who are gonna
help us get our movie made?

07:06.794 --> 07:08.860
I've read about it.
It happens.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.063
Also, let's agree not to get talked out
of shooting the movie in black and white.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.866
Perfect.
Right?

07:14.868 --> 07:18.403
I get it, and I don't need the extra
weird stare. Guys, we're gonna do great.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.772
I have a good feeling about this.
Everybody ready to rumble?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.107
Yeah, wait.
Where we gonna stay?

07:23.075 --> 07:24.976
Do I look worried?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.547
Alice Kinney
is the principal owner

07:28.549 --> 07:31.383
and designer
of Alice Kinney designs.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.285
Alice is...

07:33.287 --> 07:35.787
A depressed,

07:35.789 --> 07:39.825
newly separated... loser.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.129
- Hello?
- -<i> There she is.</i>

07:44.131 --> 07:46.465
<i>The California girl.</i>
Hey.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.732
How's your birthday going?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.334
It's good, so far.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.503
There's a lot going on. It's
the girls' first day of school.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.305
<i>You called them, right?</i>
Uh, hey.

07:53.307 --> 07:57.976
I do not need you...
To remind me to do that.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.112
Okay. So you did or you didn't?

08:01.114 --> 08:03.281
They will hear from me
before the end of the day.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.649
<i>Anyway, look.</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:08.787
I was calling you
to wish you a very happy 40th.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.256
It's fine, right?
It's not as bad as you thought.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.325
It's-it's going great so far.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.661
I'm very busy. I'm just prepping
for that job interview tomorrow.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.931
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
Good luck with that.

08:19.933 --> 08:25.003
Thanks. Uh, listen, Austen, have you
heard anything about the move here?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.339
Because the girls ask me every single day.
"Is daddy coming?

08:27.341 --> 08:29.107
<i>When's he getting his house?"</i>

08:29.109 --> 08:31.209
<i>I'm kind of running out of answers.</i>
Oh, yeah.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.378
I ask all the time too.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.681
They think they might have found someone
to run things out there. So that's good.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.085
<i>Yeah, and once that happens, then
things should all fall into place.</i>

08:41.386 --> 08:43.020
Austen, they're ready for you.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.490
I'll be there in one sec. Alice?

08:45.492 --> 08:47.826
Yeah.
<i>Don't get mad at me</i>

08:47.828 --> 08:49.594
for saying this, but...

08:51.464 --> 08:52.597
I miss you.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.175
My boys. You made it!

09:04.177 --> 09:05.911
Yes!

09:05.913 --> 09:08.813
You told us if we were serious
about this, it was la or bust.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.683
- So here we are. -Listen. So sorry I
had to keep pushing this meeting.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.653
It's the end of the summer, the Jewish
holiday. This time of year is insane.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.722
- No worries at all. -All right.
Good stuff. So here we go. Okay.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.925
Harry Dorsey, Teddy
Dorsey, George Appleton.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.727
Director, writer, star of
<i>mad youth,</i> the best short...

09:22.729 --> 09:25.230
You know what? No, the best
film I saw at south by.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.865
Whoa.
Thank you.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.700
Paul hasn't stopped talking
about you since the festival.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.268
I'm Jason. Great to meet you.
I'm Jason too.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.504
Double Jasons. Mind-blowing, yeah.
I know, it's crazy.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.239
Let's have a seat, everybody.
Now listen up.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.608
We have some great ideas

09:36.610 --> 09:39.044
about how to turn your short
into a feature.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.246
And, again,
I really did love it.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.748
I saw it again this morning while
I was running on the treadmill.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.017
- It is special. -This is a
breakout role for you, Teddy.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.353
We should get you out on
auditions right away.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.721
- Yeah?
- Definitely.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.456
And, George, your writing...

09:51.458 --> 09:55.060
Your writing is so spot-on.
I just love that Joan character.

09:55.062 --> 09:57.629
I think we've all had a Joan
in our lives, am I right?

09:57.631 --> 10:00.465
- Thanks. It's Jane. -Would you ever
be interested in any episodic work?

10:00.467 --> 10:02.033
I mean, yeah.

10:02.035 --> 10:06.471
But in terms of our movie,
what's the next move here?

10:06.473 --> 10:09.808
Right. Okay. Well, first thing we
need to do is to attach a producer.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.477
And it just so happens
somebody's already interested.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.146
I might have slipped your short
to Justin Miller...

10:15.148 --> 10:17.248
And he kinda flipped for it.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.918
- Justin Miller? -Is that the guy who
produces all those horror movies?

10:19.920 --> 10:22.087
He's been looking to do
something a little more human.

10:22.089 --> 10:25.557
He's very smart, by the way, and he's done
insanely well off those horror films.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.292
Okay, guys.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.961
He's a big producer. He likes your movie.
This is a good thing.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.797
Definitely. But does he know we
don't have a finished script yet?

10:32.799 --> 10:36.439
Yeah, and that is a great thing, actually, because
Justin wants to develop it with you guys.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.938
And this one here
looks like he wants to kill me.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.173
No, that's just George.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.576
Only thing is, I talked
to his development guy,

10:44.578 --> 10:46.778
and they're concerned about the
movie being in black and white.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.580
That's okay, that's okay.
We can, uh...

10:50.316 --> 10:53.118
- Maybe we can talk him into it.
- Right. Okay, guys, look.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.286
If you don't like him,
we're gonna find somebody else.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.155
But Justin can make
your movie happen.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.823
So be open. Okay?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.992
Yeah. We're open.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.928
Here you go.
Thank you so much.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.296
I know you're his brother. Shh.

11:05.298 --> 11:08.833
Are you... are you Teddy
Dorsey from <i> mad youth?</i>

11:08.835 --> 11:10.769
I'm just trying to be a normal
human being for one day.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.871
Oh, my god.
I'm a huge fan.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.374
Har, can we chat for 30 seconds
about the black-and-white thing?

11:16.376 --> 11:18.843
George, have a little faith, please.
Let me get it off my chest.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.780
Guys, guys. Hey. I wanna make a toast.
Seriously.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.848
To this incredible journey
and to us and...

11:23.850 --> 11:25.383
Hey, how's it going? Hi.
Hi.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.651
That was a beautiful toast.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.753
Very moving.
I love la.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.889
Oops. Sorry, sorry.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.090
No problem.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.829
Do you like it?
I love this. Yes.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.731
It is your best
business card yet.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.033
Oh, thanks.
But be honest with me.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.235
Am I one of those women who
thinks every one of their hobbies

11:44.237 --> 11:45.904
is worthy of being a profession?

11:45.906 --> 11:48.239
- What? No. -Maybe you're just
good at too many things.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.911
I love you, but I was a terrible clothing
designer and even worse photographer.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.146
Come on. That's what you've
always been great at.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.981
No, it's true. I don't
wanna say I told you so,

11:56.983 --> 11:59.350
but I have been saying
this for, what, 13 years?

11:59.352 --> 12:03.021
Well, we will see. I have a meeting with
my first potential client tomorrow.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.256
- That's amazing. Who?
- Her name is Zoey bell?

12:05.258 --> 12:07.158
- Have you heard of her?
- No.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.160
She's a socialite, I guess.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.564
Anyway, that's what I found out from
googling her for eight hours last night.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.032
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.400
- Okay.
- What?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.235
Don't kill me for saying this,

12:17.237 --> 12:19.437
- but there's this sweet guy
in my yoga class. -What?

12:19.439 --> 12:21.906
No. Just hold on.
He's newly divorced.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.708
He told me he wants
to be set up with someone.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.577
I'm not ready.
You are.

12:25.579 --> 12:27.412
I have only been separated
for five months.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.447
My god, some people get
remarried after five months.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.249
Okay, but I have a lot
going on with the move

12:31.251 --> 12:34.686
and Isabel
and the girls in a new school.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.221
And I...
Look, I'm starting a business.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.856
Right.
Okay.

12:37.858 --> 12:40.558
I need to get settled and...

12:40.560 --> 12:44.896
Girls, it's my birthday.
Let's just have fun.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.799
So where on the east coast
are you from?

12:47.801 --> 12:49.467
New York.
No way.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.902
- I'm from New York.
- Really?

12:50.904 --> 12:53.037
Yeah. Where in New
York are you from? Hi.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.639
The Upper East Side.
How about you?

12:54.641 --> 12:57.709
Well, not nearly as cool as Upper
East Side. Hello? Excuse me.

12:57.711 --> 12:59.577
Pardon me.
Can I help you?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.212
Can I have
two glasses of rosé, please?

13:01.214 --> 13:02.981
- Yes.
- Thank you.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.586
Hi. How you doin' tonight?

13:08.588 --> 13:11.055
Me?
Uh, yeah.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.957
Oh, um, I'm doing great.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.759
Thank you for asking.
Mm-hmm.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.228
I'd like to offer to buy
you drinks... really.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.130
But I think the bartender is

13:19.132 --> 13:21.399
slightly under the impression
that I'm taking her home tonight.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.901
Oh. But you're not.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.270
No, I'm not.
And why is that?

13:25.272 --> 13:27.472
Because then I'd have to
stop talking to you.

13:27.474 --> 13:32.010
I hate to do this, but the manager
is making me ask for your ID, so...

13:32.012 --> 13:34.913
So I'll give it to you then.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.615
Okay.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.818
How's that? You should
take it as a compliment.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.319
Mm-hmm.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.954
I'm Harry, by the way.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.923
I'm definitely old enough
to drink alcohol. Ooh.

13:44.925 --> 13:49.360
I'm Alice. Me too.
Obviously.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.558
Bar's closing. How does
everybody feel about dancing?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.993
- Whoo! Yes!
- For sure!

14:54.995 --> 14:56.694
Yeah, somebody feels great.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.472
Oh.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.441
Sorry. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.310
Just alcohol makes me
a little bit nervous.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.378
And also kissing
a complete stranger.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.347
Mm-hmm.
But I'm fine, I'm fine.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.222
You okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

15:59.258 --> 16:01.092
Is it super hot in here?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.336
Oh.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.404
Sorry. I just need a second.
Yeah, yeah.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.840
Do you want water
or a cold washcloth?

16:15.842 --> 16:19.177
Wow. You are so maternal, Alice.
You should be a mom.

16:20.679 --> 16:22.046
All right.
I think I'm gonna...

16:23.082 --> 16:24.983
Uh... yep. Yep. Yep. Oh.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.761
Okay.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.412
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.114
You're awake.
Yeah.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.415
How are you feeling?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.418
Better. Better.
Good, good.

18:40.420 --> 18:44.155
Oh, Alice, I'm so sorry you had
to see me like that. Yeah.

18:44.157 --> 18:47.492
Oh. It's not exactly a
stellar first impression.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.961
Please. I used to throw up all
the time when I was your age.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.629
Oh.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.565
I mean, not all the time,
but, you know, I get it.

18:54.567 --> 18:59.103
Yeah. My embarrassment level
is still a 10.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.072
So... oop.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.074
Sorry.
Oh, yeah.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.243
I had clothes on
when I got here, right?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.678
Yeah, I don't know where...
Yeah, I don't know when they...

19:07.680 --> 19:09.447
Mm-hmm. But here they are.
Thanks.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.283
I guess George and Teddy
left me here.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.185
They must have thought we, uh...

19:14.187 --> 19:17.655
Uh, no, no.
Um, they're in the living room.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.358
I guess they passed out too.
Oh.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.727
I guess we all raged last night.
Yeah.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.764
- Did you wash these?
- I did.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.734
But only because I was doing a
load, and I've been up since 5:30.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.037
- Thanks.
- Yeah. No problem.

19:34.306 --> 19:37.842
Uh... okay.
I'll get out of your hair then.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.544
Great.
Okay.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.847
Not that you... you do not have
to feel bad about any of this.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.349
I never get out, like, ever.

19:45.351 --> 19:49.153
So this was actually really good for
me, and I had a really fun time.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.689
And, thanks to you, I didn't do
anything I regret, so...

19:51.691 --> 19:53.824
And I just always act out
on my birthday.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.061
It's like my own personal new year's
Eve, so I just go, like, waah!

19:57.063 --> 20:01.299
Then I just reel it back
to normal.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.901
Look, hey, I'm happy to let
some steam out of the kettle.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.837
I'm, uh, gonna stand up now.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.940
Oh, yeah, exactly.
Yes, okay, of course.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.078
Grab it quickly.
Okay, okay.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.347
I can't believe you're making us
late on our first week of school.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.249
I said sorry.

20:18.251 --> 20:21.252
Hurry up, you guys.
Rosebud, grab the backpack.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.653
Okay, Nanna.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.424
Well, well.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.426
Huh.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.995
Okay, you're just gonna
grab the backpack.

20:30.997 --> 20:34.265
Hi. What are you guys doing home? I
thought Nanna was taking you to school.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.867
What's going on?
You're acting weird.

20:36.869 --> 20:39.870
I'm not acting weird.
Oh, my...

20:39.872 --> 20:41.872
- Oh, my god.
- -Alice.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.575
What?

20:44.577 --> 20:49.113
He was fixing that... you know that thing
that's broken in my room underneath the...

20:49.115 --> 20:51.616
Uh, IZ, can you
go fix Rosie a bagel?

20:51.618 --> 20:53.184
Sure. Come on.
Thanks.

20:53.186 --> 20:54.785
- Mom.
- Who are those guys?

20:54.787 --> 20:57.521
- I don't know.
- You could've called first.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.524
Well, who would've thought you'd
have company at 7:00 in the morning?

21:00.526 --> 21:03.060
- So, uh, we're just
gonna slip out.

21:03.062 --> 21:06.464
Thank you very much
for everything, Mrs., um...

21:06.466 --> 21:09.066
- Oh, my god.
- You look so familiar.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.768
Have we met before?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.737
That's insane.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.606
No, I feel like I definitely
know you from somewhere.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.975
She was married to John Kinney.
She was in all of his movies.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.243
Who's this one now?

21:19.245 --> 21:21.746
- Oh, my god.
- Wait.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.248
You're Lilian Stewart.
That's awesome. Really?

21:24.250 --> 21:27.084
And I'm pretty sure
this is John Kinney's house.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.086
Hold on. How do you
know all of this?

21:29.088 --> 21:32.757
I stumbled into that room back there
with all your dad's stuff. I'm sorry.

21:32.759 --> 21:36.727
I just got a little lost. I'm a
huge, huge fan of your father's.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.163
- You're John Kinney's daughter?
- Yes, she is. And you are?

21:39.165 --> 21:41.432
- Am I free to head home now?
'Cause I... -not yet.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.068
- Yep. Okay. -As fun as this
has been, believe it or not,

21:44.070 --> 21:46.771
I have a meeting to go to,
so maybe we should wrap it up.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.440
We're filmmakers too, you know?
Just like your husband.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.642
Everybody is, doll.
We're in la.

21:51.644 --> 21:55.413
I can't believe you're here and you're you.
This is surreal.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.153
- You're a terrific actress.
-Come on. I mean,

21:58.178 --> 22:00.484
I did a few small
parts here and there.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.254
You were also smokin' hot. Like in
the movie with the yellow bikini.

22:03.256 --> 22:06.023
- I was like, "whoa, hello!"
- Come on!

22:06.025 --> 22:09.760
Alice, did you hear what he said?
Yes.

22:09.762 --> 22:14.365
John sits down at the table next to mine
at ma Maison, and 10 minutes later,

22:14.367 --> 22:18.202
he pulls his chair up to mine
and offers me the lead in <i> Lola.</i>

22:18.204 --> 22:20.771
Said he liked the way I
ordered my quiche Lorraine.

22:20.773 --> 22:23.207
- I know.
- So I have to get going.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.710
Does anybody
wanna walk out with me?

22:25.712 --> 22:28.179
Actually, I'm gonna stay and
make the boys some breakfast.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.648
So can you drive the kids to school?
This is so fun.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.184
Is that cool if we hang with your
mom for a little? Yeah. No, no.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.585
That's fine with me.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.856
Wait, you're saying that was
your first movie ever?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.958
I know, right?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.227
Hey, Alice? Do you have a minute?
Yeah.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.297
Sure. Could we just maybe
exchange phone numbers or...

22:46.299 --> 22:48.366
I don't know.
Harry, I'm very late.

22:48.368 --> 22:52.069
Listen, I think you woke up to a completely
different person than you met last night.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.472
And I appreciate the
gesture, I really do,

22:54.474 --> 22:56.907
but how old are you, like, 30?

22:56.909 --> 22:59.744
Twenty-nine?

22:59.746 --> 23:00.911
Twenty-eight?
Something like that.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.413
- Oh, Jesus.
- Bye, Nanna.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.482
Okay, girls, come on.
Time to get in the car.

23:04.484 --> 23:07.051
Okay, okay.
She's so intense.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.886
No, I'm not.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.489
Good luck with everything.
Maybe I'll see you around.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.824
Hope so.
Come on, ladies.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.328
- Did you guys have a sleepover?
- -What?

23:17.330 --> 23:19.897
How did you meet? Yeah, are
you friends with their mom?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.832
Friends with their mom?
How old do I look?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.434
I don't know. Mom age.

23:23.436 --> 23:28.439
Wow, you have done just a
tremendous amount of work, Alice.

23:28.441 --> 23:31.509
Oh, yeah. This is
just a lot of blue.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.744
Well, I googled your house...

23:33.746 --> 23:36.347
Yeah. And I thought the
Hamptons thing would be great.

23:36.349 --> 23:38.582
Yeah. Why don't you
sit down for a second.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.885
Oh, sure.
Yeah. I-i, um...

23:40.887 --> 23:44.422
God, I feel like I might've
misled you in some way.

23:44.424 --> 23:49.860
Because the truth is I don't
have this much stuff for you.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.962
At least not right now.
Oh, okay.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.533
Maybe I misunderstood, because on the phone
you said you were unhappy with things.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.601
Yeah, yeah, and I did say that.
I did say that.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.204
You're absolutely right.
I am unhappy with things.

24:00.206 --> 24:03.274
But if I'm just being
honest with you,

24:03.276 --> 24:05.476
I was working with
this other interior decorator,

24:05.478 --> 24:08.479
and we just have creative differences,
or whatever you want to call it.

24:08.481 --> 24:12.483
Like I just kind of hated her,
and so I had to let her go.

24:12.485 --> 24:17.488
And I'm looking for someone really just
to coordinate deliveries and pickups

24:17.490 --> 24:20.791
and that kind of thing, and
then after we wrap all that,

24:20.793 --> 24:25.095
then maybe we can talk about you doing
some of the rooms that she didn't get to.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.964
Does that sound okay with you?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.301
Oh, yeah. Of course. Absolutely.
I'm up for anything.

24:30.303 --> 24:33.070
'Cause there is one room that I
would need you to start right away.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.072
That would be amazing.
What room?

24:35.074 --> 24:37.641
It's my daughter
Gwyneth's playroom.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.978
Okay. Do you want to
show me the room?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.581
I can't do that right now because
I have to take this call.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.349
I'm sorry about that,
and I have a blowout.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.985
But why don't you e-mail me, and
then... of course. Well, um...

24:47.987 --> 24:50.921
Okay, so the meeting's over. Then
we'll sort of organize everything.

24:50.923 --> 24:56.327
Okay. Should I follow... okay. Marta,
can you please show Alice to G's room?

24:56.329 --> 25:00.164
Marta! By the way, can you just make sure to
take your shoes off when you get into the house.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.267
Yeah, of course. We have a strict policy.
Rob, I hear you. Jesus.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.736
Uh...
No need to yell.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.509
So she taught you
about the solar system?

25:11.511 --> 25:14.111
Mm-hmm.
Oh, can you name any of the planets?

25:14.113 --> 25:18.315
I can name Mercury,
Venus, earth,

25:18.317 --> 25:21.852
- Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- Mm-hmm.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.522
Pluto isn't considered
a proper planet.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.724
All right.
Here you go.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.392
Oh. Oop, sorry. I forgot you.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.829
What?

25:31.831 --> 25:33.297
Just hear me out.

25:33.299 --> 25:36.300
They need a place to crash,
you've got a guesthouse.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.636
So I thought, you know,
maybe they could stay here.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.872
Stay here? I don't even know
two of their names, mom.

25:41.874 --> 25:46.176
Oh, come on. Since when is having three
adorable guys hanging around such a bad thing?

25:46.178 --> 25:48.379
Maybe they could help you out a little.
Help me out?

25:48.381 --> 25:51.482
Help me out with what? Did
they ask you to ask me this?

25:51.484 --> 25:53.317
No. Absolutely not.
Tell the truth.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.185
It was entirely my idea.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.521
I think these boys have
a real shot at making it.

25:57.523 --> 26:00.891
I adored their movie.
It was raw and great.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.227
You saw their movie?
Yeah. Look.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.595
They're dead broke.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.497
If you don't let them stay here,

26:06.499 --> 26:10.367
then they have to move home back
to upstate New York or wherever

26:10.369 --> 26:13.604
and blow their chance
at having a career here.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.773
They need you, Alice.
How's that?

26:15.775 --> 26:17.942
They don't know anyone here.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.178
I like them. Your father
would have liked them.

26:22.781 --> 26:26.784
Be a patron of the arts, Alice.
It's good for the soul.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.353
Why are you suddenly
romanticizing dad?

26:29.355 --> 26:32.289
The man impregnated another woman
while he was still married to you.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.857
Why do you always obsess
over that?

26:33.859 --> 26:35.726
Why don't you obsess over that?

26:35.728 --> 26:40.097
Because I'm a big girl,
and he's gone now, so I won.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.467
If they hadn't met me,
was there a plan "b"?

26:43.469 --> 26:45.970
Maybe it was fate
that they met you.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.305
Maybe you could be
the person who says,

26:48.307 --> 26:52.643
"they were living at my house when
they wrote" whatever it's called.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.278
Just for a month or so.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.214
- A month?
- Okay, a week, whatever.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.316
If it doesn't work out,
sayonara.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.653
But just try looking at this

27:02.655 --> 27:04.688
as something that could be
sort of exciting.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.925
What if the kids
don't feel comfortable?

27:07.927 --> 27:10.260
You know everything that
Isabel is going through.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.998
This could really set her off.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.933
Okay.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.972
Yes!

27:21.974 --> 27:24.642
- Whoo!
- There we go, there we go, there we go.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.745
We can do better than that.
Okay. All right, we're back.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.985
This is so incredibly cool
of you. Thank you so much.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.788
Seriously, you're a lifesaver.
Can I help you with anything?

27:37.790 --> 27:39.690
Uh, no, I've got it.

27:39.692 --> 27:42.660
Uh, okay. The couch
turns into a bed.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.962
The hot water over here
takes a minute to turn on,

27:44.964 --> 27:47.331
and there's extra towels
in the closet.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.732
- Perfect. Thank you.

27:51.469 --> 27:55.873
Uh, I'm just gonna grab that
and flush it down the toilet.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.609
Okay, guys, I hope last
night didn't confuse you.

27:58.611 --> 28:00.477
This is definitely not
an after-party

28:00.479 --> 28:02.446
and crash-on-the-couch
type of place.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.015
This is more of
a market-list-on-the-fridge,

28:05.017 --> 28:08.719
Latin-homework-after-school,
dinner-at-six kind of house.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.654
I know that's not
the coolest stomping grounds

28:10.656 --> 28:12.523
for a bunch of starving
artists like yourselves,

28:12.525 --> 28:15.826
but let's just do our best
not to cramp each other's style.

28:15.828 --> 28:18.462
- Okay?
- Well said.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.731
Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

28:20.733 --> 28:24.501
Alice, I think you and I
should just start over.

28:24.503 --> 28:28.038
Yeah, obviously, we... well, we had
no idea we'd be living together.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.175
We're not. I mean that
I'd be staying here.

28:31.177 --> 28:37.548
And, well, uh, clearly I did not
rock your world last night.

28:37.550 --> 28:43.821
So maybe we should just pretend that whole thing
never happened and start over as friends?

28:43.823 --> 28:46.256
I agree. And I'm actually
glad you brought it up.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.692
Good, and I'm only
saying something

28:48.694 --> 28:51.729
because we're staying here
and the kids and everything.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.363
Harry, we're good.
We're friends.

28:53.365 --> 28:56.166
Who are attracted to each other.

28:56.168 --> 29:00.904
On just my end.
Not on yours. My bad.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.340
He's telling her
they should just be friends.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.409
How do you know that?
Mm, I speak Harry.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.545
Do you think he'll stick to it?
Depends how long we're here.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.014
She seems uneasy. You think
she's okay with this?

29:11.016 --> 29:14.251
No, I think she's super cool with
it, and this place is gorgeous

29:14.253 --> 29:18.956
and, like, weirdly clean, and
600 times nicer than the hotel!

29:18.958 --> 29:21.759
Okay, let's just stay a couple days
until the Justin Miller meeting.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.328
Oh, my god, I'm not kidding.
You gotta feel these sheets.

29:26.798 --> 29:30.834
Oh, wow, these sheets are insane.
What are they made of?

29:32.804 --> 29:35.339
Dude!
This is pretty great.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.623
You know that was his least
favorite of all his films?

29:52.625 --> 29:55.759
- He tried to buy it back from the studio.
- Hi. I'm sorry.

29:55.761 --> 29:58.495
I came over here unannounced.
I'm just an early riser.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.898
Then I noticed that the door
was open and... it's okay.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.666
I've been dying
to get back in here.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.635
Are you joking about
what you just said?

30:04.637 --> 30:07.971
Because this movie is some
of his best work, I think.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.473
Actually, I agree.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.508
Oh, let me show you something
really cool. Sit down.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.577
Okay.
Um...

30:13.579 --> 30:15.245
Okay.

30:15.247 --> 30:18.949
This is the original script
with his notes.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.884
No way.
Yes.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.989
Wow. I just love to
see his handwriting.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.492
I literally have goose bumps.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.460
Why is this all in boxes?

30:30.462 --> 30:33.497
Shouldn't this be at the academy of
motion picture arts and sciences?

30:33.499 --> 30:37.768
Yeah, I just moved back, and I'm having a
hard time letting go of some of these things.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.937
Why did you move back?

30:39.939 --> 30:41.772
If you don't mind me asking.

30:41.774 --> 30:45.309
No, that's
a very normal question,

30:45.311 --> 30:48.312
and one I should probably
come up with an answer for.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.215
Um... you know, my husband
and I are separated.

30:51.217 --> 30:55.018
He's in the music business, and
there's just a lot of partying.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.888
Which was really fun, and
we had a great time. Yeah.

30:57.890 --> 31:02.693
And then we got older, and we weren't
kids anymore, and then we had kids.

31:02.695 --> 31:06.997
And he was still coming in at 2:00 in
the morning smelling like don Julio.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.700
And I tried to hold it together.
I really, really did.

31:09.702 --> 31:12.135
So hard. It was...

31:12.137 --> 31:14.371
But, you know, god, you make
a decision about your life

31:14.373 --> 31:17.374
when you're 25 years old, and then
you fast-forward 15 years later,

31:17.376 --> 31:20.077
and you think, "god, was that
really the life decision

31:20.079 --> 31:22.746
that's, like, a good life decision
for the rest of your life?"

31:22.748 --> 31:25.148
And then you're just like...
"I don't know!"

31:25.150 --> 31:26.516
Yeah.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.752
I don't know. You know?

31:28.754 --> 31:31.488
I'm sorry about your marriage,

31:31.490 --> 31:33.690
but you seem to be handling
everything really well.

31:39.864 --> 31:42.232
Oh.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.736
Oh, my god. What?

31:45.738 --> 31:48.105
My new client wants me to come
over, but I told her I can't come.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.274
Isabel has guitar lessons
on Thursdays.

31:50.276 --> 31:53.243
And she wants me to pick her up
a pressed juice on the way?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.611
That's weird, right?

31:54.613 --> 31:57.247
Yeah, I think that
would be considered weird.

31:57.249 --> 32:02.085
Um... I could take Isabel
to class if you want.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.922
I mean, I don't have a car,
but I'd be happy to help.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.624
Really? Thank you.
Yeah.

32:07.626 --> 32:11.028
My dad's old car is in the garage. You
know how to drive a stick, right?

32:12.931 --> 32:14.264
Mm-hmm.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.404
So you like your new school?

32:20.406 --> 32:21.838
Um, I do not. No.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.742
Oh. Today actually
wasn't so bad.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.211
I want to be a writer, and my
homeroom teacher, miss Avery,

32:28.213 --> 32:30.213
told me about
this playwriting contest.

32:30.215 --> 32:34.151
Teachers pick about five plays to
be performed at the fall show.

32:34.153 --> 32:37.454
Miss Avery thinks I should submit
something, but I'm really not sure.

32:37.456 --> 32:41.491
That's so cool.
You should definitely do it.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.061
Well, truthfully,
I would love to,

32:44.063 --> 32:46.797
but we have to perform
our own plays,

32:46.799 --> 32:49.666
and I don't think my body
would physically allow for that.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.436
Won't you regret it if you don't do it?
It sounds like a great opportunity.

32:52.438 --> 32:57.674
Yeah, but I get sort of anxious, you know?
Just sometimes.

32:57.676 --> 33:00.110
It's on and off,
and the cause is unknown,

33:00.112 --> 33:02.679
but it may be related to an
imbalance of natural chemicals

33:02.681 --> 33:04.414
between the nerve cells
and the brain.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.450
Says WEBmd.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.420
Ah. Sorry.
I should take this.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.956
We'll get back to that.
Uh, hello?

33:12.958 --> 33:15.625
<i>George, Jason green from WCA.
How ya doin'?</i>

33:15.627 --> 33:19.296
Hi. I'm great, thanks. Uh, what's up?
<i>I have good news.</i>

33:19.298 --> 33:21.365
There's this thriller I think we
told you about in our meeting.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.700
They're looking for someone
to do a new pass on the script.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.769
I sent over your writing
samples, and they loved them.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.537
<i>Loved. Can I set up a meeting?</i>

33:27.539 --> 33:29.973
Wow, uh, I'm flattered.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.942
That's, uh...
They used the word "loved"?

33:31.944 --> 33:34.111
<i>Really?</i> No, but you
could just tell.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.380
Oh. Is that
the other Jason?

33:36.382 --> 33:38.315
<i>Hi. Yes, I just
jumped on.</i>

33:38.317 --> 33:39.816
Oh, hi. Uh, yeah.

33:39.818 --> 33:42.219
Can I discuss with the guys
and then let you know?

33:42.221 --> 33:44.988
It wouldn't be the worst thing for
you to put your name out there,

33:44.990 --> 33:46.823
<i>make some money.</i>

33:46.825 --> 33:49.192
<i>We got a job. I'll set it up.
This is good. I promise.</i>

33:49.194 --> 33:51.328
- Will you let me think about it?
- Hello? Jason?

33:51.330 --> 33:52.462
Other Jason?

33:53.865 --> 33:56.333
That sounds pretty cool.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.835
Yeah.
Yeah, it does, right?

33:58.837 --> 34:01.905
I just don't know if I'm
ready to go out on my own.

34:01.907 --> 34:05.976
Won't you regret it if you don't do it?
Sounds like a great opportunity.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.746
- I like what you did there.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.149
That was good.
Mm-hmm.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.751
Okay, so we're gonna redo
the whole playroom.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.853
You want it a little more
age-appropriate.

34:16.855 --> 34:19.222
You want to keep bright colors
but tone down the pink.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.824
A teepee would be cool. Hmm.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.259
Maybe some beanbag chairs.

34:22.261 --> 34:23.860
Hey, hi, girls.
Sorry to interrupt.

34:25.264 --> 34:26.830
Oh, hey, Dexter.
Hi, honey.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.068
Alice, can I borrow you
for a second? Sure.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.670
I was supposed to be at this
event, like, 15 minutes ago,

34:33.672 --> 34:36.206
and then my nanny calls me and
tells me she's in brutal traffic.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.442
She's not gonna be here
for another hour.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.511
I wouldn't normally do this, but could
you please stay until she gets here?

34:41.513 --> 34:44.281
Oh, well, I mean, it's
5:15, and I have to...

34:44.283 --> 34:47.184
I know. I mean, obviously,
I would pay you for your time.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.918
I don't know what else to do.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.520
You wouldn't have to pay me.
You're so sweet.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.522
Thank you so much. Hey, G!
Well, I...

34:52.524 --> 34:55.958
Alice is gonna babysit for you until
Idalia gets here, okay, honey? I love you.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.295
And could you give her a
bath, just a quick one?

34:58.297 --> 35:00.630
And then let Dexter out before
you go, okay? Thank you.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.035
Okay.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.973
- Hello?
- <i>When were you gonna tell me</i>

35:09.975 --> 35:12.809
<i>that three strangers
were living in your house?</i>

35:12.811 --> 35:15.645
I'm sorry. I know.
I should have.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.614
I mean, are you
airbnb-ing the house?

35:17.616 --> 35:20.383
<i>- What? No, of course not.
- So where did you meet them?</i>

35:20.385 --> 35:22.486
I met them at a...
You know what? Look.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.254
It's really not
that big of a deal.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.156
They're gonna stay in
the guesthouse for a few days.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.258
It was actually
my mother's idea.

35:28.260 --> 35:31.161
<i>Isabel told me that one of them
drove her to her guitar class.</i>

35:31.163 --> 35:32.829
I don't want your houseguests

35:32.831 --> 35:34.664
hanging out
with the girls, okay?

35:34.666 --> 35:36.733
I feel weird enough
about not being there.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.568
Well, then why don't you
come here?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.337
<i>You don't think
I'm not dying to see them?</i>

35:40.339 --> 35:42.806
But I-i just can't right now.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.142
There's this new guy
I'm tryin' to sign,

35:45.144 --> 35:47.210
and his concert's
this weekend in Miami.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.014
He's supposed to be
the next Sam Smith.

35:51.016 --> 35:54.151
<i>Really.</i> Yeah. But I'll
come out soon though.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.685
<i>I promise.</i>

35:55.687 --> 35:56.786
Don't shake your head.

35:56.788 --> 35:57.988
I wasn't.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.689
<i>I gotta go, Austen.</i>

35:59.691 --> 36:01.925
<i>You'll get here
when you get here. See you.</i>

36:06.430 --> 36:08.165
- Hey, you're home.
- Hi, mom.

36:08.167 --> 36:10.800
Hey. I'm home
and I'm starving.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.936
It smells so good in here.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.605
When you were working, I thought
I'd make dinner, if that's cool.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.541
- Yeah. That's cool.
- Never thought of that.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.209
I think that's
absolutely brilliant.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.877
Mm-hmm. <i>Hola.</i> Hey.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.512
Isabel, I think someone
needs a Marg.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.381
Uh-oh.

36:25.716 --> 36:27.717
Thank you.
Now please unlearn that.

36:27.719 --> 36:30.487
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
Let's do this.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.689
Shall we take the plates outside?
Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.025
- What's outside?
- You'll see.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.661
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

36:37.663 --> 36:39.796
I can't tell you.

37:00.718 --> 37:03.820
<i>I feel like I know you
from somewhere.</i>

37:03.822 --> 37:06.389
<i>Oh? Well, I just moved here.</i>

37:06.391 --> 37:07.791
<i>Where from?</i>

37:17.001 --> 37:18.168
Wow.

37:31.916 --> 37:34.284
Hey.
Hey.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.553
Can I help?
Sure.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.388
Thank you for tonight, Harry.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.257
Are you kidding? I
should be thanking you.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.525
No, seriously.
I, um...

37:42.527 --> 37:45.528
My kids haven't seen that many of my
dad's movies. So it was really special.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.031
Well, they are so cool,
by the way.

37:48.033 --> 37:50.033
Job well done.
Thanks.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.202
Mm-hmm. They're really
taking to you guys.

37:52.204 --> 37:54.738
I think they're happy to have
some male energy around here.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.172
It is very pink in this house.

37:57.742 --> 38:00.243
You seem to have aced
the single parent thing though.

38:00.245 --> 38:05.582
Really aced it. I mean, yeah. Look, I
assume it's not as easy as it looks.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.718
Well, you have an "I've got
this" thing about you,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.320
and it's super impressive.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.956
And personally, I th...

38:12.958 --> 38:15.125
Look, I think it's pretty brave

38:15.127 --> 38:17.127
what you did, starting over.

38:17.129 --> 38:20.330
I don't know your ex, but, uh,

38:20.332 --> 38:23.166
he must be some kind of maniac to
have let you slip through his hands.

38:26.270 --> 38:27.370
Where does this go?

38:28.272 --> 38:31.541
Uh, it goes over there.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.651
You know this cabinet
is broken, right?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.254
Okay.
You gotta stop blushing.

38:44.256 --> 38:47.223
Your face is too cute when you blush.
I can't handle it.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.392
You got a screwdriver?

38:50.461 --> 38:52.295
Thanks.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.998
That cabinet has been broken
for so long. You have no idea.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.535
Anything else I can do for you?

38:59.770 --> 39:02.772
Got anything from Ikea
I can assemble or...

39:14.018 --> 39:15.452
I thought we agreed not to.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.454
I know. I know.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.955
But I fixed your cabinet.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.626
Hey, you know I'm 40, right?

39:23.628 --> 39:26.663
Uh, yeah, I knew that.
Like ballpark.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.698
Okay, good, and, uh,

39:28.700 --> 39:31.380
I didn't know if you'd ever gone out
with somebody my age who has...

39:34.638 --> 39:36.239
Two kids.

39:36.241 --> 39:39.209
And the girls come in at 6:30
in the morning sometimes,

39:39.211 --> 39:41.144
so you can't be in there then.
That's fine.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.146
Then sometimes they come in
in the middle of the night.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.715
So you can't be in there then either.
Not a problem.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.452
And also...
Mm-hmm.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.122
Alice?
Yeah?

39:53.090 --> 39:55.058
You're makin' me nervous.

39:55.060 --> 39:56.993
You don't seem nervous.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.928
I don't wanna fight with you.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.193
Thank you so much for coming out
on Saturday. I appreciate that.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.462
I'm heading to Shanghai tomorrow.
I'm glad we could get this goin'.

40:32.464 --> 40:33.930
Can I get you anything else?

40:33.932 --> 40:35.532
No, thanks, Maya.
This looks fantastic.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.066
Okay, great. Enjoy. Thanks.
Thank you.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.602
So I'm not gonna pull
any punches here.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.404
I get it.
I'm the horror guy.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.406
That's all basically
anybody ever sends me.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.608
So when WCA sent me your short

40:45.610 --> 40:48.211
and nobody died in it or turned
into a zombie or something,

40:48.213 --> 40:50.480
I thought, "all right.
This is fantastic."

40:50.482 --> 40:52.282
Thank you.
We're glad you liked it.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.384
But if I'm gonna go out
of my wheelhouse,

40:54.386 --> 40:56.319
there are basically
three kinds of movies

40:56.321 --> 40:58.288
that I'm interested
in producing.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.723
- Female-centric comedies. -George
writes women really well.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.926
My love interest is a great part.
Yeah.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.261
I wouldn't exactly say it's
a female-centric comedy, but...

41:05.263 --> 41:07.263
I totally agree.
Okay, forget women.

41:07.265 --> 41:08.932
Here's something else
that might work for you.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.401
What about
a found-footage love story?

41:11.403 --> 41:13.236
You know?
No one's ever done that before.

41:13.238 --> 41:16.473
You mean, like somebody found footage
of Sam and Jane's love story?

41:16.475 --> 41:18.608
I mean,
why would they have been...

41:18.610 --> 41:20.243
Filming themselves.
Filming, exactly.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.579
I have no idea.
You know, just a thought.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.214
All right,
the last thing I'm into...

41:25.583 --> 41:27.350
- An awards movie. You know?

41:27.352 --> 41:30.086
Like a really...
Like a good movie.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.422
Like they used to make. We would
love to make a really good movie.

41:32.424 --> 41:33.523
- Yes.
- Yeah?

41:33.525 --> 41:35.792
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.828
Beautiful. All right, that's what we're
gonna do. We're gonna make a great movie.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.763
So where are we on the script?

41:40.765 --> 41:43.500
I'm about halfway through. I think
it's coming along really well.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.969
Good, good, okay. I watched
the short again last night.

41:45.971 --> 41:47.804
- I made some really great notes.
- Hmm?

41:48.974 --> 41:50.139
Oh. I'm sorry, guys.

41:50.141 --> 41:52.008
- I gotta take this. One sec.
- No problem.

41:52.010 --> 41:55.178
- Yeah, go for J. Yes, I saw the e-mail.
- George, what are you doing?

41:55.180 --> 41:57.113
- Shut up, Teddy. I have to.
- Stop it.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.948
"Try setting
in the south somewhere.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.617
More <i> American sniper"?</i>

42:00.619 --> 42:02.285
It takes place in Brooklyn.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.454
- Does it say that?
- It does say that.

42:04.456 --> 42:06.623
- He's gonna walk back.
- "Add dance sequence."

42:06.625 --> 42:08.458
"Channing," question mark.
That's what it says.

42:08.460 --> 42:09.526
I gotta go.
George...

42:09.528 --> 42:11.494
Do you believe it says that?

42:11.496 --> 42:14.998
I'm so sorry about that, guys.
Just a few quick thoughts here.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.467
- You okay?

42:17.469 --> 42:19.502
He had interesting things
to say, George. Like?

42:19.504 --> 42:22.305
Like he wants to help us get our movie
made. That was incredibly interesting.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.073
He was a parody
of a movie producer.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.676
He did say some crazy shit.
What is wrong with you both?

42:26.678 --> 42:28.344
He's a big deal,
and he believes in us.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.713
That actually makes me
like us less.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.182
Let's just continue the conversation, okay?
It was a first meeting.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.653
George? Hey.
Would you look at me? George?

42:36.655 --> 42:38.755
We're on the same team, okay?

42:39.857 --> 42:41.724
We can keep talking to him,

42:41.726 --> 42:44.594
but we're not setting it in the south,
where none of us have ever been.

42:44.596 --> 42:46.996
- Fine, I agree. That's not a thing.
- What are you doing?

42:46.998 --> 42:48.598
I've never been in the pacific.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.733
Okay, you're just gonna...

42:50.735 --> 42:52.302
I'm goin' in.

42:57.775 --> 43:00.243
You know these things
take forever to happen, right?

43:00.245 --> 43:03.846
I'm gonna keep writing it the
way we always wanted it to be.

43:03.848 --> 43:06.916
Between us, I kinda took another
little job in the meantime.

43:06.918 --> 43:10.086
I'm just doing it in my spare time.
Seriously?

43:10.088 --> 43:13.022
Yeah. Somethin' came
my way from WCA. Guys!

43:13.024 --> 43:15.892
No kidding. What's the job?
Come in!

43:15.894 --> 43:18.595
Don't tell Harry. I won't.
What is it?

43:18.597 --> 43:20.964
- If he found out, he'd make it about him.
- Just tell me already.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.966
It's a rewrite of a thriller.

43:22.968 --> 43:27.637
Anyway, it pays well, and it's good
to have a backup plan, you know?

43:27.639 --> 43:30.273
What if being three boy wonders
doesn't work out?

43:30.275 --> 43:33.076
Harry has this vision
of the three of us

43:33.078 --> 43:35.144
lined up in tan suits at Cannes.

43:35.146 --> 43:37.547
Meanwhile, for once, I'd like
to be able to make money.

43:37.549 --> 43:40.717
Well, just warn me before you tell
him so I can leave the country.

43:40.719 --> 43:43.920
At some point you're gonna need to
learn to be less of a little brother.

43:43.922 --> 43:45.655
I don't have the same shit
with him that you do.

43:45.657 --> 43:47.557
You support him
sleeping with Alice then.

43:47.559 --> 43:50.893
Can I not be the odd man out because I
am the only one not pining for Alice?

43:50.895 --> 43:53.329
Okay, come on.
We're not goin' there.

43:53.331 --> 43:55.632
All I'm sayin' is
"iceberg ahead."

43:55.634 --> 43:57.900
'Cause when he
changes his mind about her,

43:57.902 --> 44:00.603
or she gets tired of his shit...

44:00.605 --> 44:03.640
All I'm sayin' is we need to start
lookin' for another place to live.

44:03.642 --> 44:06.342
Which I'll be able to pay
for now because of my job.

44:06.344 --> 44:08.478
I don't want to leave Alice's.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.013
I like being with her family.

44:10.015 --> 44:11.914
We're gonna have to leave
eventually.

44:11.916 --> 44:14.250
Well, eventually
ain't today, my bro.

44:14.252 --> 44:15.785
Attica!

44:15.787 --> 44:17.787
Attica!

44:17.789 --> 44:19.656
Attica!

44:20.824 --> 44:22.291
I'm glad you do.

44:22.293 --> 44:24.193
I mean, I just...
I don't know.

44:24.195 --> 44:27.764
I think the dialogue needs a bit
of... yeah, well, you wrote it.

44:27.766 --> 44:29.432
And exhale. Let it go.
Ooh.

44:29.434 --> 44:30.867
Wonderful.

44:30.869 --> 44:33.236
Hold on. I don't think
we should interrupt.

44:34.471 --> 44:35.471
Yeah.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.274
Okay.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.144
Namaste. I'm Teddy.
Hi.

44:41.146 --> 44:42.245
Hi.

44:46.151 --> 44:47.483
No, I'm just kidding.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.485
No, no, I'm doing it...

44:49.487 --> 44:51.521
Tell me about the other guys.
What are they like?

44:51.523 --> 44:54.223
Okay. Well, Teddy used to work
at the genius bar,

44:54.225 --> 44:56.659
so he's been helping me with
my website, which is awesome.

44:56.661 --> 44:58.361
He's adorable.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.863
And George
has really taken to Isabel.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.800
He encouraged her to submit
a play to a school contest,

45:03.802 --> 45:05.535
which has been amazing for her.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.036
Yeah, hold on a minute.

45:07.038 --> 45:08.404
I think you're telling me

45:08.406 --> 45:10.206
that you have
free live-in childcare,

45:10.208 --> 45:13.176
full-time tech support,
and sex?

45:13.178 --> 45:15.044
I can't complain.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.908
Yeah, and I don't...

46:34.591 --> 46:37.326
I think you should bring Harry
to my dinner party tomorrow.

46:37.328 --> 46:38.895
What? No, no.

46:38.897 --> 46:41.230
It'd be good to take him
for a spin in the real world,

46:41.232 --> 46:44.467
where the lights aren't so dim
and the sheets aren't so soft.

46:44.469 --> 46:47.904
Okay, well, we are not there yet.
That feels like a lot.

46:47.906 --> 46:50.640
Why is it a lot? Seems like the perfect
chance to show off your new boyfriend.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.475
He's not my boyfriend.

46:52.477 --> 46:53.709
What is he then?

46:56.313 --> 47:00.183
I don't know. He's young, and I
might feel too self-conscious.

47:00.185 --> 47:02.418
All the single guys
we know date women that age.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.320
They're not self-conscious.
That's true.

47:04.322 --> 47:05.688
Come on. Bring him.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.857
Okay. Maybe.

47:07.859 --> 47:09.759
Maybe.

47:09.761 --> 47:11.861
This is
just gonna take a second.

47:11.863 --> 47:13.396
Why are the gates open?

47:20.470 --> 47:22.805
Hmm.

47:22.807 --> 47:24.540
Hey, uh, is Zoey here?

47:24.542 --> 47:27.210
Uh, she'll be back soon.
Can I help you?

47:27.212 --> 47:29.212
I just have these pillows
for the playroom.

47:29.214 --> 47:31.380
Oh, okay, I can take it.
Uh, and you're?

47:31.382 --> 47:34.817
Oh, uh, I'm sort of
her decorator.

47:34.819 --> 47:35.885
Really?
Yeah.

47:35.887 --> 47:37.587
I'm sort of her decorator.

47:38.822 --> 47:41.057
Oh, right.

47:41.059 --> 47:44.460
She said there was someone she kind
of had creative differences with.

47:44.462 --> 47:47.196
Yeah. I quit,
if that's what you mean.

47:47.198 --> 47:49.498
But she begged me to come back.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.834
I mean, she made me an
offer I couldn't refuse.

47:51.836 --> 47:54.837
Sorry. I didn't know
that she hired someone else.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.706
She said she was desperate.

47:56.708 --> 47:59.008
"Desperate"? What did she
say when you called her?

47:59.010 --> 48:02.511
She was talking a million miles a minute,
like she'd had one too many green juices.

48:02.513 --> 48:04.580
She said, "this other woman
made her feel more comfortable

48:04.582 --> 48:06.716
because she'd worked with her
for years."

48:06.718 --> 48:09.585
Then she said, "I'll call you back in two
secs," but she <i> never</i> called me back.

48:09.587 --> 48:12.388
Basically, I've been doing all
this ridiculous work for nothing.

48:12.390 --> 48:15.091
I mean, I organized
this woman's jeans, Teddy.

48:15.093 --> 48:16.826
Whoa.
What are you taking?

48:16.828 --> 48:18.561
It's for anxiety, you know.

48:18.563 --> 48:21.397
I just take a half of a half,
and never during the day.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.965
That's a large half.

48:24.768 --> 48:27.003
I should have quit
before it came to this.

48:27.005 --> 48:29.939
- Yeah, that sounds great.

48:29.941 --> 48:34.043
Alice, everything you told me about this woman
sounds awful, but you gotta check yourself.

48:34.045 --> 48:36.245
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Promise?

48:36.247 --> 48:39.749
I do. I mean, look at us.
How did we end up here with you?

48:39.751 --> 48:42.084
I think things do
actually work out for a reason.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.253
And just forget about Zoey.

48:44.255 --> 48:47.790
This means it's time to move on, which is
gonna be easy because your website's live...

48:47.792 --> 48:49.358
- What?
- And your pinterest is up,

48:49.360 --> 48:51.227
and it's all linked
to your Facebook and Instagram.

48:51.229 --> 48:53.629
My website is live? Oh, yeah.
Check it out, buddy.

48:53.631 --> 48:56.265
Oh, my god.
Teddy, this is amazing!

48:56.267 --> 48:58.367
Ah. Thank you.

49:00.103 --> 49:01.704
That was Justin.
Yeah?

49:01.706 --> 49:03.739
He thinks he might have found
someone to finance our movie.

49:03.741 --> 49:05.541
No way! That's amazing! Yeah.

49:05.543 --> 49:08.311
We're gonna get drinks tomorrow
to talk about it. Wow. Oh, wait.

49:08.313 --> 49:10.279
Does that mean
you're busy tomorrow night?

49:10.281 --> 49:13.616
Yeah, but just for a little. Did
you have something in mind?

49:13.618 --> 49:15.785
I mean, I did, actually.

49:15.787 --> 49:17.753
Tracy's having
this little dinner thing,

49:17.755 --> 49:21.724
and if you were up for it, I thought
maybe you would come with me?

49:21.726 --> 49:23.626
I'd love to do that.
Really?

49:23.628 --> 49:26.062
I've been wanting to do something
with you outside the house.

49:26.064 --> 49:27.997
I mean, I love what we've
been doing inside the house,

49:27.999 --> 49:30.433
but, yes, let's be on a date.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.301
Okay.
Okay.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.236
I'll have to meet you
after the drinks.

49:34.238 --> 49:36.906
Sure. No problem.
What should I wear?

49:36.908 --> 49:39.442
It's not, like, dressy, is it?

49:55.860 --> 49:57.660
No.
He'll have one more.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.772
I knew that
she was taking my magazines.

50:37.801 --> 50:39.568
We're gettin' along really well.

51:02.427 --> 51:04.527
You doing okay?

51:04.529 --> 51:05.728
Yeah, yeah.

51:08.398 --> 51:09.678
What are you guys talking about?

51:55.946 --> 51:56.979
Can I come in?

52:01.051 --> 52:03.319
Alice, I am so sorry
about last night.

52:03.321 --> 52:06.155
The drinks, they went late. And
Justin, he invited all these people.

52:06.157 --> 52:08.724
And the guy wouldn't shut up.

52:08.726 --> 52:12.795
And I'm pretty sure he's getting us
the money, so I couldn't ditch him.

52:14.498 --> 52:16.465
I think that's...
I think that is straight.

52:16.467 --> 52:19.502
Oh, you couldn't ditch him,
but you could ditch me.

52:19.504 --> 52:22.638
No, I... I... didn't know what else to do.
I got caught up and...

52:22.640 --> 52:24.974
You know what the truth is?
I don't care what happened.

52:24.976 --> 52:27.910
I know how it made me feel, and
I don't wanna feel like that.

52:27.912 --> 52:32.148
Okay, well, please don't let one stupid night
get in the way of what's happening here.

52:32.150 --> 52:34.450
What is happening here?

52:34.452 --> 52:37.419
I don't think either of us
know the answer to that.

52:37.421 --> 52:40.623
Okay, 'cause you came to me and you
said we shouldn't get involved.

52:40.625 --> 52:43.993
And then you showed up
and you fixed my cabinet door,

52:43.995 --> 52:45.661
and-and-and then you
kiss me.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.363
And...

52:47.365 --> 52:49.498
Whatever.
I allowed that to happen.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.701
But at some point I have
to start knowing better.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.703
And that point is now.

52:54.705 --> 52:57.840
You're
a 27-year-old kid, Harry.

52:57.842 --> 53:00.609
And it's exciting,
and you're fantastic,

53:00.611 --> 53:03.612
and you're on the cusp
of being a really great guy.

53:03.614 --> 53:06.448
But 27-year-olds
just screw up.

53:06.450 --> 53:08.617
They just do.

53:08.619 --> 53:10.619
I know 'cause I used to be one.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.789
But the last thing
that I need right now

53:13.791 --> 53:16.725
is to be sitting
at some party in a dress

53:16.727 --> 53:20.029
waiting for someone or something
that isn't gonna show up for me.

53:20.031 --> 53:22.831
So whatever this is or was,

53:22.833 --> 53:24.733
it's just gotta end.

53:24.735 --> 53:26.468
Okay?

53:26.470 --> 53:28.637
I know this because...

53:31.374 --> 53:33.075
Because I know this.

53:34.644 --> 53:37.379
Harry, you said you
were gonna play with us.

53:37.381 --> 53:40.015
Yeah, okay. One second, champ.
One second.

53:40.017 --> 53:41.217
Okay.

53:43.420 --> 53:46.522
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

53:46.524 --> 53:49.858
I screwed up. I was wrong.
I wasn't thinking.

53:49.860 --> 53:52.261
Can I make it up
to you tonight, please?

53:52.263 --> 53:53.896
Uh, no. Actually,
I'm going out tonight.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.831
You... where?

53:55.833 --> 53:57.032
I have a date.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.234
You have...

53:59.836 --> 54:01.136
Why wouldn't I?

54:05.842 --> 54:08.010
Miss Avery e-mailed me.
They picked my play!

54:08.012 --> 54:09.712
I knew it.
I didn't.

54:09.714 --> 54:12.514
This is major. Congrats.

54:12.516 --> 54:14.717
Can I ask you a beyond
huge enormous favor?

54:14.719 --> 54:16.418
Oh, and you can say no.

54:16.420 --> 54:19.221
Oh, sorry. Am I
interrupting you working?

54:19.223 --> 54:20.923
Oh, is it that other job?

54:20.925 --> 54:23.225
Yeah, but who cares? What's up?
You can ask me anything.

54:23.227 --> 54:26.528
Will you go up onstage
with me, at the play?

54:26.530 --> 54:27.696
Onstage?

54:27.698 --> 54:30.466
No, not like
in the play or anything.

54:30.468 --> 54:33.435
Just off to the side. You can
see the whole thing from there.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.704
I asked miss Avery,
and she said it was fine.

54:35.706 --> 54:38.941
I told her it's like having an
emotional support dog, only human.

54:38.943 --> 54:40.943
Anyways,

54:40.945 --> 54:43.979
just in case I feel nervous or like
I'm gonna pass out or anything.

54:43.981 --> 54:45.914
Just seeing you there
would make... hey, IZ.

54:45.916 --> 54:48.684
It would be a great honor.
I'll be there.

54:52.622 --> 54:53.989
Yeah, so they
never found my brother.

54:53.991 --> 54:55.324
So naturally, I don't do boats.

54:55.326 --> 54:59.061
But I gotta let that go.

54:59.063 --> 55:02.965
What do you do? Because
Kori wasn't exactly sure.

55:02.967 --> 55:04.967
I used to work for a developer.

55:04.969 --> 55:07.970
Basically, we would just
tear down things you love

55:07.972 --> 55:09.571
and put up things you hate.

55:09.573 --> 55:12.041
Are you gonna drink that?
No. You can have it.

55:12.942 --> 55:14.610
Yeah, so... oh, Alice.

55:14.612 --> 55:17.146
Have you seen
that Ted talk by any chance

55:17.148 --> 55:18.814
on the science of happiness?
Mm-mmm.

55:18.816 --> 55:21.083
I think you'd really like it.
Is it that obvious?

55:21.085 --> 55:23.185
No, that's not what I'm saying.

55:23.187 --> 55:25.020
It's just...
It just really touched me.

55:25.022 --> 55:27.189
And about eight months ago,
I quit my job.

55:27.191 --> 55:28.857
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Just like that.

55:28.859 --> 55:30.592
I had a Jerry Maguire moment.

55:30.594 --> 55:32.528
Oh, my god,
I love <i> Jerry Maguire.</i>

55:32.530 --> 55:34.963
Yeah, I moved to Bali and
lived there for a few months

55:34.965 --> 55:37.299
until I came down with malaria
and had to come back here.

55:37.301 --> 55:39.435
And I'm trying to get
my old job back.

55:39.437 --> 55:43.706
I think it was Thomas
browne... sir Thomas browne...

55:43.708 --> 55:47.042
Who said, "I am
the richest man alive.

55:47.044 --> 55:48.677
I have that in me
which"... oh, my god.

55:48.679 --> 55:50.045
I'm okay.

55:50.047 --> 55:51.547
My arch Nemesis is here.

55:51.549 --> 55:53.315
Why do you have an arch Nemesis?

55:53.317 --> 55:55.551
She's standing next to
the <i> Sarah, plain and tall</i> girl.

55:55.553 --> 55:58.120
She looks
all rich and depressed.

55:58.122 --> 56:00.823
I'm gonna go talk to her, Nate. Oh,
Alice, I don't think you should.

56:00.825 --> 56:03.292
I'm gonna do it.
Alice, don't do that.

56:03.294 --> 56:04.693
Here I go.
Alice.

56:04.695 --> 56:05.761
They... okay.

56:12.702 --> 56:15.337
- Hi, Alice. My gosh.
- Zoey, hi.

56:15.339 --> 56:18.240
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm on a date.

56:18.242 --> 56:20.042
With a man.

56:20.810 --> 56:22.411
Great.

56:22.413 --> 56:25.314
Um, I don't think you've
met my husband, rob.

56:25.316 --> 56:26.682
This is Alice.
Okay.

56:26.684 --> 56:28.817
She's been sort of helping
out around the house.

56:28.819 --> 56:31.987
Nice to meet you, rob.
I'm your wife's bitch.

56:31.989 --> 56:34.256
I don't know
if I would call it that.

56:34.258 --> 56:37.192
Really? Would you say
you're a nice person to me,

56:37.194 --> 56:39.228
or would you say you're nicer
to maybe the labrapoodle?

56:39.230 --> 56:40.496
It's a labradoodle.

56:40.498 --> 56:41.563
Whatever.

56:41.565 --> 56:44.032
Okay.

56:44.034 --> 56:46.402
What are you doing with your face?
Are you unwell?

56:46.404 --> 56:48.837
- I think it's Dexter.
- Okay, that is not nice, Alice.

56:48.839 --> 56:51.440
He's a rescue, and I find
that really offensive.

56:51.442 --> 56:54.042
You've had a little bit
too much to drink

56:54.044 --> 56:56.078
and you're sort of
embarrassing yourself.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.746
I'm embarrassing myself?
Yes.

56:57.748 --> 57:00.382
Well, that's refreshing. Because
normally that's your department.

57:00.384 --> 57:03.352
- Am I right, Bob? -Alice,
let's just call this quits,

57:03.354 --> 57:05.387
and I will call you
in the morning.

57:05.389 --> 57:09.925
Hey, babe, I quits, okay? Because you
cheated on me with the fancy stylish woman.

57:09.927 --> 57:12.127
And on top of that,
you're a deeply dark individual.

57:12.129 --> 57:14.296
So... we done.

57:14.298 --> 57:15.564
Great.

57:15.566 --> 57:16.665
We... done.

57:23.940 --> 57:25.841
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

57:29.212 --> 57:30.846
Brutal.

57:44.260 --> 57:47.162
Ah, boy.

57:47.164 --> 57:50.365
So, wanna tell me what happened?

57:51.901 --> 57:56.171
Well, I drank my date
under the table.

57:56.173 --> 57:57.973
And I was so rude.

57:57.975 --> 58:02.511
And then I saw Zoey bell in her
kimono and her cute husband,

58:02.513 --> 58:04.413
and I went temporarily insane.

58:05.448 --> 58:07.282
Jesus.

58:07.284 --> 58:10.018
I hope you quit at least.
Oh, yes.

58:10.020 --> 58:12.354
That I made very clear.

58:12.356 --> 58:16.725
Well, dare I ask why you're feeling
so pugnacious this evening?

58:18.161 --> 58:21.330
All signs point
to the lead singer of your band.

58:21.332 --> 58:24.433
Ah. I was afraid
of that.

58:24.435 --> 58:27.836
You know, he tends to have
this effect on people.

58:27.838 --> 58:32.140
Thing you gotta realize about
Harry, and I say this out of love,

58:32.142 --> 58:36.178
is he doesn't do
the right thing enough.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.913
Doesn't know how.

58:38.781 --> 58:40.449
Trust me.

58:40.451 --> 58:43.285
Do you know what the difference
is between men and women?

58:44.787 --> 58:48.490
Men just...
They can just do things.

58:48.492 --> 58:51.059
And women have to think
about the consequences

58:51.061 --> 58:53.328
and the feelings
and the pros and cons.

58:53.330 --> 58:55.497
And we make lists.

58:55.499 --> 58:57.499
And men just act.

58:57.501 --> 58:59.401
They just do.

58:59.403 --> 59:01.436
Not you though, George.

59:02.872 --> 59:04.306
You're one of the good ones.

59:09.812 --> 59:11.747
Thank you, Alice.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.117
You're like a woman.

59:29.332 --> 59:32.734
Oh, my god.
Tell me you see him too.

59:32.736 --> 59:35.871
Austen, what are you doing here?

59:35.873 --> 59:38.941
Well, I've been
calling you for hours.

59:38.943 --> 59:40.943
Where have you been?
Where are the kids?

59:40.945 --> 59:43.345
They're at my mom's.
But wait.

59:43.347 --> 59:45.347
I was just...

59:45.349 --> 59:47.849
I know I just
asked you this, but...

59:47.851 --> 59:50.519
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, god, Alice.

59:50.521 --> 59:53.922
Oh. I don't know. I don't know.
I've been going out of my head.

59:53.924 --> 59:56.925
I just can't think straight.
Is that one of them?

59:56.927 --> 59:58.894
Hello.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.662
Hi. Okay.

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:03.332
Hey there.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.636
George Appleton.
Hi.

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:09.671
Big fan of your family, yeah.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:13.408
- Mm-hmm. -Okay, I'm
gonna let you two, uh...

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:15.944
'cause I gotta... I'm
just gonna... yeah, okay.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:19.281
Oh, it feels so good to be here.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.516
Oh, god.

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:25.420
You did such an incredible
job with the house.

01:00:25.422 --> 01:00:27.322
It totally feels like you now.
Thanks.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.224
I'm really impressed.

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:32.761
God, you remember us sittin' in here
when you brought me to meet your dad?

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:35.063
Yeah, a million years ago.

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:37.065
And you look different too.

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:38.767
I do? Yeah. Relaxed
or something.

01:00:38.769 --> 01:00:41.136
You look fantastic, Al.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.939
Well, you're catching me on a
really stellar roll tonight.

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:46.808
I've had quite a... you know
I had to come here, right?

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:51.780
You get that. I mean, there are three
strange guys living with my family.

01:00:51.782 --> 01:00:55.250
And you stopped calling me back
all of a sudden, you know?

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:57.419
Girls are not
facetiming me anymore.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:59.421
- Where do you keep your forks?
- In the drawer.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.357
So you just
showed up unannounced?

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.925
Don't you think you
should have called first

01:01:03.927 --> 01:01:05.661
and then told me
that you were coming

01:01:05.663 --> 01:01:07.829
so I could have at least
prepared, told the girls?

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.532
I would have called. Or is this
just what worked for you, Austen?

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:13.774
I would have called, but I was afraid you
were gonna tell me that I couldn't come.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.304
I always tell you to come.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:18.340
You know, when you left...

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:22.577
I finally felt like I wasn't
lettin' anyone down anymore.

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:26.481
And that was good, for a minute.

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.984
But then I realized

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:30.719
that the best part of my life

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.188
had just moved away
across the country.

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:36.858
And there I was,
alone in our old place.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.927
There was no more laughter.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.697
No meals together.

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:45.100
No more monkeys
jumping on the bed.

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:49.004
And I miss our family.

01:01:49.006 --> 01:01:51.073
So I bought a ticket to la,

01:01:51.075 --> 01:01:52.641
and I left within the hour

01:01:52.643 --> 01:01:55.110
because I wanted
to say this to your face.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.281
To your beautiful face.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:01.950
Let's fix this.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.120
Let's not give up.

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.824
What's he doing just
showing up out of nowhere?

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:10.759
We should go in there.
She needs us.

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:12.694
Oh, really? You're
gonna go in there.

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:14.563
You're gonna say, "I'm
the captain now," huh?

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:16.565
Look. They're sitting
so close together.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.533
Guys, enough, okay? He's the
father of her children.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:20.235
She's moved on. She
doesn't need him anymore.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:22.170
George, is he good-looking?
I can't tell from here.

01:02:22.172 --> 01:02:24.339
What's his vibe?
Is it loser-y?

01:02:24.341 --> 01:02:27.342
I don't know. He's got like a
classic Clark gable thing.

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:29.411
There's like a little bit
of Sean Penn in there.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:32.047
Like he could jump ya at any moment.
You know what I mean?

01:02:32.049 --> 01:02:34.616
Clark gable meets Sean Penn?
I'm going inside.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:37.953
Harry, come on, man. The last thing she
needs. How do you know what she needs?

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:40.155
Oh, my god.
She's taking him to the guest room.

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.091
He's staying.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.193
Well, thank you
for putting me up.

01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:47.996
I'm a little bit drunk. I'll
probably regret it in the morning.

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:52.100
I'm not that drunk.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:54.536
Good night, Austen.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:56.972
Well, I meant what I said, Al.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.874
Will you just think about it?

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.130
Mmm.

01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:30.739
Good morning.

01:03:30.741 --> 01:03:32.874
Oh, hi.

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.878
Please, take a seat.

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.390
Harry.

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:51.326
Austen.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.861
Why is he staying with us?

01:03:52.863 --> 01:03:56.164
What am I supposed to do,
ask him to stay in a hotel?

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:59.701
Why is this guy in la? I can think
of three really good reasons.

01:03:59.703 --> 01:04:02.604
- Seems pretty selfish to just show up like this.
- Well, meet Austen.

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.206
Alice, please stop avoiding me.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.808
Can we just...
I don't know... talk?

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.678
- Whoa.
- Girls. Girls.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.146
- Guess what.
- What?

01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:12.180
Daddy!

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:13.348
Good morning!

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.217
Daddy!
Oh!

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:18.353
- I'm so happy to see you guys.
- -I can't believe you're here!

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.856
Rosie, you're so tall.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:23.058
Look at you.
You're like a supermodel.

01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:25.393
IZ, look at... oh, my goodness.
Loving those sneakers.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:27.028
When did you get here?

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.731
Late last night. We thought
we'd surprise you this morning.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.499
- Come on.
- Good to see you, Lil.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:33.635
Yeah. Hi.
Mwah. Mwah.

01:04:33.637 --> 01:04:36.805
Looking fetching as usual.
Me? You are nuts.

01:04:36.807 --> 01:04:40.242
Look, I have to change for my spinning
class, so I'm going to get going.

01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:42.611
- Ally, I'll talk to you later, okay?
- Yep.

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:45.313
Still cute.

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.017
Hmm.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:51.152
Okay, let's eat.

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:53.989
Okay, okay, but then we were
walking back from dinner

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:56.324
on this beautiful moonlit night

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:57.993
through this tiny little village

01:04:57.995 --> 01:05:00.428
just outside
Saint-rémy-de-provence.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.565
- And we took one wrong turn.
- Oh.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:06.101
- And suddenly out of nowhere...
- oh, my god, I forgot about this.

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:08.436
This strange
little woman appeared.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:10.105
Yes.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:12.908
She pushes me in the chest.
She grabbed your mother's bag.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:16.544
And your mother just immediately,
without a second thought,

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:17.879
sprints after her,

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:21.616
leaps into the air
and tackles her to the ground.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:24.052
- Oh, my god.
- That's funny, mommy.

01:05:24.054 --> 01:05:26.688
I'm pretty sure there was no
leaping, and I didn't tackle her.

01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:28.456
So you weren't
both on the ground?

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.458
Yes, but... your mother was incredible.
You should have seen her.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.594
She was just... just beyond.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.462
She was wildly impressive.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.564
I don't know about that, but...

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:39.034
So, IZ, did you tell your
daddy about your play?

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:40.235
She did.

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.903
She did.
It's very exciting.

01:05:41.905 --> 01:05:43.772
I'm not surprised, because she's
always been a great writer.

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:45.140
Will you stay for it, daddy?

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:47.909
- When is it again?
- Next Friday.

01:05:47.911 --> 01:05:49.144
- Yeah.
- Ah.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:51.913
Well, I'm not sure
if I can stay that long.

01:05:51.915 --> 01:05:55.817
But if I can, I will.
I'm desperate to be there.

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:58.720
You know, George has been really
very helpful with the play.

01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:00.622
Did I tell you
the guys are filmmakers?

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:02.557
Yeah, yeah. Heard that.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.592
God, I have no idea
how you guys do it.

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:06.995
It takes such discipline.

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:09.164
And I guess
at the end of the day,

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.832
it's totally down
to luck, isn't it?

01:06:10.834 --> 01:06:12.133
If it turns
into anything, right?

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:13.635
Yeah. Luck and talent.

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:15.203
Copy that.

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:17.672
Lot of luck.

01:06:17.674 --> 01:06:19.841
Hey, I had an idea. Why don't
we go for dinner tonight?

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:21.476
- Oh yeah!
- Yeah!

01:06:21.478 --> 01:06:23.845
Sunday night dinner like we used to.
That would be fun, right?

01:06:23.847 --> 01:06:26.448
- You could show me your new favorite place.
- Yeah, can we, mommy? Please.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.516
Yeah, we could go early,
be back by 8:00.

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:30.485
Please.
Okay, sure.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:32.020
Yay!

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:33.989
Just a sec!

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.691
Hi.
Hey.

01:06:36.693 --> 01:06:39.127
I thought I'd check in. I know
it's none of my business.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:41.963
I just wanted to make sure that
you're okay. Yeah. Come in.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:44.165
No, I'm completely fine.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.935
I mean, on the one hand,
Austen is saying things to me

01:06:46.937 --> 01:06:49.170
that I've wanted to hear
for god knows how long.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.606
And on the other hand, he's the
actual king of manipulation.

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:59.214
Hey, can I come in for a second?
Yeah.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.449
Hey.

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.884
Did not know you were in here.

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:04.986
I hope this
isn't out of line, but...

01:07:04.988 --> 01:07:06.955
- you look really nice, by the way.
- You do.

01:07:06.957 --> 01:07:09.124
- Thanks.
- Just really worried about the girls, you know?

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.493
I have experience
with guys like this,

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:13.395
and their dad
shows up out of nowhere,

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:16.164
and he's acting like he's father
of the year when we know he isn't.

01:07:16.166 --> 01:07:18.366
He's gonna move back to New York.
What happens to iz...

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:20.535
Alice, I've gotta talk to you.

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:22.237
Oh, my god.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.872
Can it wait?
I'm a little bit busy.

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:26.141
Uh, no, it can't.

01:07:26.143 --> 01:07:29.544
I feel like everything is out of sorts
between us. Wow. You look great.

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.379
And smell great.
Can I come in?

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.448
Do you have
an Advil? I...

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:35.884
Didn't realize
I had an audience.

01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:38.453
We're just gonna have
to talk about this later...

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.224
What, I didn't make the cut
for the pre-party?

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.160
No, there is nothing going on.

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:46.995
There's never been
so many people in this room.

01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:49.397
We're gonna be late.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:52.067
You guys,
I will talk to you later.

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:53.735
It's gonna be good.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.638
Bye.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:58.473
Good night.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.943
Okay.

01:08:01.945 --> 01:08:03.812
Night, kids.

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:08.316
I don't like him.
Mm-mmm.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.420
It's way past Rosie's bedtime.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.122
Should we call and make sure
that everything's okay?

01:08:14.124 --> 01:08:15.623
I'm shocked
she married that guy.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:18.093
- She knows his bracelets are a problem.
- I don't know.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:20.261
I could see him having a certain
appeal when they were younger.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:21.830
The accent's cool.

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:24.131
Hey, we were just starting to...

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:27.202
- Shh.
- Oh. Sorry.

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.871
Did you guys have a good night?

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:32.439
Yeah. Nothin' special.
Just ate some lasagna.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.375
What was left of it.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:36.743
- How was your dinner?
- The girls had a great time.

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:37.879
And you?

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.515
I actually had fun too.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:45.153
Um, well, we were gonna
have a nightcap.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:48.223
You wanna come over
to our place?

01:08:50.158 --> 01:08:52.660
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna hit the hay.

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:54.696
Night, guys.

01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:58.332
- Yeah, good night.
- Night.

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:00.734
It's not true. She never falls
asleep before midnight.

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:02.569
Okay, thank you.

01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:04.238
We did not need to know that.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:09.777
Night-night.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:12.013
I love you, daddy.

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:15.082
Oh, I love you too,
my beautiful girl.

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:20.421
Sleep well.

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:28.263
"He reaches for the painting.

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:33.801
Floats in slow motion
through the air."

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:34.969
Georgie.
Hey.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.470
Great news.

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:39.374
The finance guy is flying in
to meet with us next Friday.

01:09:39.376 --> 01:09:40.707
We're meeting him
at sunset tower,

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.710
and then we'll go from there
to see Isabel's show.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.312
Perfect. Hey, actually,
hold on a sec.

01:09:44.314 --> 01:09:47.482
Relax. I just wanna show you an
article I read about this guy.

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.117
"The painting floats
in slow motion."

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.452
What is this? What are you working on?
Okay, actually, I was...

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:53.188
You're writing something else?

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.291
Let me explain.
Uh, yes.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.296
How could you do that?

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:03.498
How could you do it? We're
almost done with our script.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.366
You're working on something
else at the same time?

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:08.069
Okay, yes, but look,
you've decided, right,

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:09.971
that we're
two halves of this whole,

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:13.308
and I've been thinking that maybe I could
be a whole on my own at some point.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:16.211
And our agents agree. Oh, okay.
Right. Right. Okay.

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.012
So you're the talent.

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:20.848
I'm just the one who got us our
financing, who directed our movie,

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.418
who submitted us to the
festival, who got us to la.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.653
You know that's not what I'm saying.
And then you go rogue

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:28.856
and you get another job
without telling me.

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:30.892
Shit, George.
You know...

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:34.195
This has not stopped me from working
on our movie, not even one bit.

01:10:34.197 --> 01:10:36.431
And excuse me if I wanna
make some goddamn money

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:39.400
and get the hell out of the mess that
you've created in this house, by the way.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:41.402
Did you not even realize?
You don't even know?

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.838
Did you think you could just have
sex with her and play with her kids

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.340
and everything would turn out fine?
Don't.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:47.442
You know what? Leave your
brain to science, Harry,

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:49.677
'cause it's truly one in a mil.
You know what? No.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.412
I'm not letting you do this.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.348
I'm not, man.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.250
You're a little
in love with Alice,

01:10:55.252 --> 01:10:57.218
and you're mad at me
because of it.

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.453
Wow.

01:10:58.455 --> 01:11:00.455
You and I have been
down this road before.

01:11:00.457 --> 01:11:03.124
Okay, I am not in love
with her, okay?

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:06.527
I just love a lot of things about her,
like her face and her personality.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:07.862
Hey.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:12.600
What up, guys?

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:15.036
What is that? What is that?
What are you holding?

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:17.138
What? Oh, these.
They're audition pages.

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:18.706
I'm actually
testing for a pilot,

01:11:18.708 --> 01:11:20.541
which I think is a good thing.

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:22.110
That's terrific, Teddy.

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:25.046
You're both taking other jobs?
Well, George already took his.

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:27.848
Why can't you be happy for him? Don't
turn this around on me and Teddy.

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.218
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.754
I haven't gotten it yet, and we
don't have a finished script.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.555
So why can't I go on auditions?

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:38.192
You know what? Good luck
to the both of you.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.067
Yeah, okay, well, just call
me after the show, all right?

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:48.770
Yeah, I'll still be up. Okay.

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:50.305
Okay, bye.

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:00.648
Hey, man.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:02.383
Can I join you?

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:06.754
Everything cool, brother?

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:10.692
I saw Harry take off.

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:12.794
Seemed pretty heated.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:14.662
I'm sorry, but I don't
wanna get into it.

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.698
It's all good. You don't
have to worry about it.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.701
Well, I wouldn't say that.
This is my house.

01:12:19.703 --> 01:12:21.669
With my kids, my wife.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.205
If there's a problem, I have
a right to know about it.

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:27.775
With all due respect, Austen, I don't
know if Alice would call this your house,

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.445
and she definitely wouldn't
call herself your wife.

01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:32.547
They are my kids though, right?
Hmm.

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.649
Is that one okay with you?

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.051
What exactly is it
that you're doing here?

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.053
Yeah, it's
a complicated situation.

01:12:39.055 --> 01:12:41.789
At your age, I couldn't
have understood it either.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:43.925
Try me.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.962
Well, sometimes...

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:51.999
You need a bit of space
from the things you love

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:54.168
in order for you to realize

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.070
just how much
you really need them.

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:59.707
Seriously? That sort of thing just
does not apply to your wife and kids.

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:01.509
What do you want from me, man?

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:03.978
I mean, you're gonna hate me
regardless of what I say.

01:13:03.980 --> 01:13:06.581
But if Alice and I are gonna try
and work through our problems,

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.050
which I think it's
pretty clear we are,

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:13.087
then this game of house you're all
playing is gonna have to end.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:14.756
And you think
that's what Alice wants?

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:16.958
Alice doesn't know
what she wants.

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.362
Ow!

01:13:21.364 --> 01:13:23.531
What the hell was that for?

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.867
It was for Alice!

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:28.669
You do not wanna do this. I am
a trained athlete. I can box.

01:13:28.671 --> 01:13:30.605
Okay, all right,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:32.940
You wanna go for it, pal?
You wanna go?

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:35.376
Come on. Let's go. Let's go!
Hey. Hey.

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:39.547
Did your stupid hipster brother
sleep with my wife, huh?

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:41.416
Come on. Man up
and tell me. Tell me!

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:42.750
We're better off without you.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.285
We?
Yeah.

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:46.487
What are you even saying?

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:05.673
- Oh, my god.
- Aah!

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.778
What is going on?

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.415
He-he started it.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:16.150
Teddy, what the hell?

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:19.086
- Okay, hold on. -Okay, let's all
just chill out for a second.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.889
He's a liability, okay?
There are kids in this house.

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:24.492
Come on, Alice.
This is insane.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:27.995
This is too much for me. I didn't
sign up for this, all of this.

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:29.664
I agree.
I think he needs to leave.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.735
I think you guys need to
find somewhere else to stay

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.704
while we get our lives
back on track.

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.374
Wait.

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.443
Alice.

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:44.145
I'm sorry, guys.

01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:15.443
You did the right thing, Al.

01:15:15.445 --> 01:15:17.945
He did quite a number on you.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:22.917
Ta-da.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:30.725
Alice, look at me for a second.

01:15:43.005 --> 01:15:45.406
Oh, god,
I've missed you so much.

01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:48.075
I had no idea how to be alone.

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:52.079
Austen, what are we doing?

01:15:52.081 --> 01:15:55.182
Well, our relationship is totally blurry.
You know that.

01:15:55.184 --> 01:15:56.717
I know it is.

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:59.353
And once and for all, I think
we need to clear it up.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.756
I think we should get back
to... I want a divorce.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.826
I'm-I'm not following.

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:08.362
I want a divorce.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.197
Like I legally don't
wanna be married anymore.

01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:11.999
No, I know what divorce means.

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:16.470
I thought we weren't ready
to make such a...

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.911
You're ready.
I am.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.781
I really am.

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:28.783
Right.

01:16:30.786 --> 01:16:31.919
Right.

01:16:39.928 --> 01:16:42.630
Oh, god. So I'm the idiot
who's dealt a winning hand

01:16:42.632 --> 01:16:44.665
and still managed to lose.

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.135
I think maybe this
all worked out

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:50.204
the way it was supposed to.

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:03.751
And I guess we both know that
if I'd seen a sliver of hope,

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:06.721
I would have tried
to weasel my way back in.

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:26.907
Ooh, I really hope he's here.
He has to be.

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:30.144
Justin is the only
other person he knows in la.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:32.880
Oh, my hand's killing me.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.018
Can we come in?
We wanna talk.

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:39.320
Are you gonna be mean?
I'm not in the mood.

01:17:39.322 --> 01:17:41.656
What happened to your face? I
beat the crap out of Austen.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:44.058
Bullshit artist.
Come in.

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.328
Did Alice see you do it?

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.763
Yep.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:52.299
And she kinda kicked us out.

01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:54.168
Seriously?
Yeah.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.570
And what about Austen?
He stayed? Yeah.

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.273
Oh.

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:05.446
You guys hungry?
There's some leftover Nobu.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:07.615
Harry, we came
here to apologize.

01:18:07.617 --> 01:18:10.017
Neither of us should have
hidden anything from you.

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.952
Is that a no to the Nobu?

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:14.321
I'll have some. What's Nobu?
It's just Sushi.

01:18:14.323 --> 01:18:17.858
Okay, we were just afraid
that you were gonna think

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.528
that we were doubting you
or losing faith in the movie.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.197
That's exactly what I think.
We're not bailing, man.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.166
My other job is basically done.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:27.968
And if Teddy lands another part,
then we will work around it.

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:31.105
He's right. We're doing this, all right?
We're making this happen.

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:41.916
Oh. The Nobu.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.153
Here you are.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.989
Is dad okay?

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:51.158
Yeah. Daddy is fine.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.893
He just has a little bruise.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:54.895
And he's asleep now,
so he's gonna be okay.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:57.598
I'm really sorry that you
guys had to see that.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.867
Is he moving in with us?

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:03.337
Well, he's gonna live in la,
which is great,

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.406
but he's not gonna live with us.

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.610
What about the guys?

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:11.746
Did they leave?
Mm-hmm.

01:19:11.748 --> 01:19:13.714
For good?

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:15.683
I think so.

01:19:15.685 --> 01:19:19.220
Does that mean we won't
ever see them again?

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:22.189
I mean, George was
gonna come to my play.

01:19:22.191 --> 01:19:23.891
Yeah, yeah,
I know George, honey.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:26.260
And trust me, he will be there.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:28.062
And I don't know about you guys,

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:31.699
but I'm kinda looking forward to it
just being the three of us again.

01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:35.102
Actually, I think
that sounds good.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.670
I could use
some peace and quiet.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.674
Okay.

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:43.644
I love you.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.750
Thank you.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:29.356
"So what began as a day
like any other

01:20:29.358 --> 01:20:31.826
ended as anything but.

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:33.294
The end."

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:34.862
Wonderful.

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:37.598
I love this part.
Yeah, so did I.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.136
Hi.

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:17.638
Hi.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.174
Um, come in.

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:22.009
Is it okay? Yeah. Are you kidding me?
Come on.

01:21:22.011 --> 01:21:24.144
I didn't call, but...
No, it's good.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.213
We're still
in the moving-in phase, but...

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:28.482
Oh, yeah. Wow.
Yeah.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:31.018
This place is great.
Uh-huh.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.052
Oh, man.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.854
Are the guys here?

01:21:33.856 --> 01:21:37.191
Oh, no. They just went out for a bit.
They'll be back any minute.

01:21:37.193 --> 01:21:39.393
Look, this should be me
showing up at your door.

01:21:39.395 --> 01:21:43.430
But, uh, I don't know. With
Austen there, I... I just...

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.132
Oh, he's... he's gone.

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.701
He went back to New York?

01:21:47.703 --> 01:21:52.006
No, he's here in la,
just not with me.

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:55.509
We are officially done, so...

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:56.944
Wow. Wow.

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:59.780
Well, a-plus decision.

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:01.682
Yeah.

01:22:01.684 --> 01:22:02.783
Yeah.

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.152
Um...

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:08.956
Okay.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:11.592
Alice, like, I should've...

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:14.261
I should've said this before
in a realer way at least.

01:22:14.263 --> 01:22:17.131
But I... I'm-I'm sorry.

01:22:17.133 --> 01:22:19.300
I'm sorry.

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:22.803
I'm sorry for standing you up
that night.

01:22:22.805 --> 01:22:27.274
And I think... like, I've relived it,
like, a thousand times in my head.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:30.878
And I just... I can't...
I can't wrap my mind around...

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.280
What kind of a person
would do that to you?

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.549
Let alone it was me.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:39.219
It was one of the top-five worst
decisions I have ever made.

01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:43.557
And I have made some... some pretty
questionable decisions in my time.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:47.094
Look, bottom line, you deserve
much, much better than me.

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:49.396
And I don't mean that
like... like most guys mean it,

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:51.165
which is that they
don't mean it at all.

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:54.468
I actually do.
I... I really do.

01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:57.404
You know, before I met you,

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:01.175
I was probably
more alone and terrified

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:03.844
than I'd ever been
in my entire life.

01:23:03.846 --> 01:23:07.648
And through that
crazy turn of events...

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:10.584
You made that fade away.

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:13.420
And I'll always
be grateful for that.

01:23:13.422 --> 01:23:14.989
And since you guys
have been gone,

01:23:14.991 --> 01:23:18.492
I've been really trying
to get my life in order.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.961
But it's made me
realize I just...

01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:22.763
I really miss you guys.

01:23:22.765 --> 01:23:25.332
Oh, my god, we miss you so much.
Really?

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:28.435
We talk about it all the time. I'm
so glad to hear you say that.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.441
Surprise!

01:23:34.443 --> 01:23:35.676
Hey!

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.544
Hi!
Oh, my god! Alice!

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:38.645
Hey!
Hey!

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.180
Hi, Alice.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:41.882
Oh, you got flowers?

01:23:41.884 --> 01:23:43.484
They always looked
so good at your house,

01:23:43.486 --> 01:23:45.285
I thought we'd get
some for ours.

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:47.654
Let me help you.
Yeah, thank you.

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:49.390
Okay, where's the kitchen?

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:52.059
It's over here.
How's IZ?

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:54.061
We've been texting a bit. Yeah.

01:23:54.063 --> 01:23:55.229
Yeah, yeah.
She told me.

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:56.730
She's so hyped up for tomorrow.

01:23:56.732 --> 01:23:58.565
Did she tell you
she started meditating?

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:01.135
No. But I love that.
Yeah.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:03.137
Oh, let me put those
in a vase for you.

01:24:03.139 --> 01:24:05.005
Uh, do you have a vase?

01:24:05.007 --> 01:24:07.641
Uh...
Uh...

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:08.876
We do not.
Okay.

01:24:08.878 --> 01:24:10.511
We do not have a vase.

01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:12.579
Something to buy you
as a housewarming gift.

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.563
All right, my guys.
My guys.

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:30.931
Justin.
Hey, buddy.

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:33.100
Listen, before we go in
there, whatever happens,

01:24:33.102 --> 01:24:34.868
we're still gonna make
a great movie together.

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:36.703
Okay? Not something you
watch on your smartphone

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:38.572
and forget about
before it's even over.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:42.076
Because we got the brains, we got
the heart, we got the nerve.

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:43.444
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:45.245
Yeah. All right, come on.
It's gonna be good.

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:47.181
It's gonna be good.

01:24:47.183 --> 01:24:48.715
Yeah, I knew you'd
come around on me.

01:24:50.019 --> 01:24:51.518
Hey.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.587
Yeah, yeah, we're here.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.989
Sure. Yeah, no problem.
He's running a bit late.

01:25:06.902 --> 01:25:09.303
All right, showtime.

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.878
Hey, mom.
Hi.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.950
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:22.952 --> 01:25:24.885
Hi, baby. How was your
sleepover at daddy's?

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:27.521
It was so fun.
We had pancakes for dinner.

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:34.228
They'll be here.

01:25:48.776 --> 01:25:51.044
Okay, fellas, here's the thing.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.848
I love your script.

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:57.985
I totally get
what you're going for.

01:25:57.987 --> 01:26:03.490
But maybe we could
make it even... bigger.

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:05.359
Okay, sure. How so?

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:07.127
Maybe... I don't know...
It could be sexier.

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:09.163
You know, add some
more excitement, more action.

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:12.599
Maybe the Sam character
has to assemble a group of guys

01:26:12.601 --> 01:26:14.535
from various locations,

01:26:14.537 --> 01:26:17.371
and then they have
to pull off a big heist.

01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:19.006
So basically <i> ocean's eleven.</i>

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:21.675
Yes, love it. Great.

01:26:21.677 --> 01:26:24.111
<i>Young ocean's.</i> Exactly.

01:26:24.113 --> 01:26:25.646
Sam isn't really
big-time like that.

01:26:25.648 --> 01:26:28.382
He's just doing it
to get by, you know.

01:26:28.384 --> 01:26:30.784
- Right. Right. -I know. That's
why we could dial that up.

01:26:30.786 --> 01:26:32.853
And then we get somebody
really great to play Sam,

01:26:32.855 --> 01:26:34.655
like that kid from <i> hunger games?</i>

01:26:34.657 --> 01:26:37.057
Well, actually,
we got Teddy attached.

01:26:37.059 --> 01:26:38.659
Remember? I told you about that.
Oh.

01:26:38.661 --> 01:26:40.527
- He's fantastic.
- Right, yeah, yeah.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:42.696
- You're Teddy.
- Yeah.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.731
Yeah, we'd definitely find
something for you to play.

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:47.034
Look, Justin, I trust you.
You know that.

01:26:47.036 --> 01:26:50.204
- Yeah.
- And I think that you guys are super talented.

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:52.239
My only concern
is that it's too small.

01:26:52.241 --> 01:26:54.522
- Or... I don't know... cute.
Is that the right word? -No.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.178
- We gotta run.
- Hey, wait, guys.

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.547
We appreciate you taking the time.
We really, really do.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:03.717
But truthfully, we have
an 11-year-old's play to attend.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:07.888
So if your answer is "no,"
which it seems to be,

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:10.557
since you've missed pretty much
every lovely detail in the script,

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.659
well, this isn't really gonna
make much of a difference.

01:27:12.661 --> 01:27:16.530
But I'm gonna say it anyway.
I think you're making a mistake.

01:27:16.532 --> 01:27:20.100
Teddy is one of the most talented
actors of our generation.

01:27:20.102 --> 01:27:23.904
And George,
he understands people,

01:27:23.906 --> 01:27:28.442
the way we think and why we do
the unexplainable things we do.

01:27:28.444 --> 01:27:30.677
Film is the great love
of our lives,

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:32.446
and if you take a chance on us,

01:27:32.448 --> 01:27:34.848
there is like an 80% chance
that we will not let you down.

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.785
Now, Warren, quick question.

01:27:38.787 --> 01:27:40.307
Do you happen to have
a car downstairs?

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:43.590
You were amazing. Amazing!

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.692
Har. You sure
you're okay with this?

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:48.795
Yes. There will be another guy.
Do I look worried?

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:04.911
Just breathe. Just breathe. You
can do this. You can do this.

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.349
Let's go.

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:14.554
- Sorry. The doors are closed.
- What are you... what?

01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:17.457
Once the show begins, no one is admitted.
Those are the rules.

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:19.593
You're joking, right? It's a
fifth-grade play, not <i> Hamilton.</i>

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:21.928
I am under strict orders
to close the doors at 6:00,

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:24.631
and it is now 6:15, so...

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.300
I actually need
to get backstage.

01:28:26.302 --> 01:28:28.602
There's a very, very special kid
who will be totally devastated...

01:28:28.604 --> 01:28:30.470
You know what? This is
not my problem. Whoa!

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.205
- Sorry, bud!
- Oh!

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:37.244
Maybe he should be
an action star.

01:28:37.246 --> 01:28:38.378
Go.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:44.685
Okay, you're gonna be great.

01:28:44.687 --> 01:28:48.355
<i>And now,</i> three plus three,
<i>by Isabel Blume.</i>

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.598
Teddy, Teddy.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:28:59.600
There she is.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.570
Shoot! Come on.

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:11.111
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:05.065
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Gotta get through.

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.738
What began...

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:13.807
Sorry.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:18.812
Come on, come on.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.547
Are you George?
Yes.

01:30:20.549 --> 01:30:21.782
Thank god.

01:30:21.784 --> 01:30:23.383
Wait. Who are you?
I'm miss Avery.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:24.851
You're miss Avery?
Yeah.

01:30:24.853 --> 01:30:26.953
And you're George?
Yeah.

01:30:26.955 --> 01:30:28.522
Come on.

01:30:28.524 --> 01:30:30.323
She can see you from here.

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:33.360
What began...

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:36.296
Isabel.

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:38.999
Isabel.
Isabel.

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.639
You got this.

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:57.818
What began as a day like any
other ended as anything but.

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:01.755
There must have been something pretty
extraordinary in the air that day,

01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:04.057
even though, as always,

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:07.894
it was 72 degrees and sunny
in my new hometown,

01:31:07.896 --> 01:31:11.298
the weirdly, wonderful city
of Los Angeles,

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:14.134
which, as it turns out,
isn't much of a city at all.

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.476
Okay, but, you guys, admit it.

01:31:22.478 --> 01:31:25.445
It was a hit, right? I mean, can
you call a school play a hit?

01:31:25.447 --> 01:31:26.813
Because it definitely was.

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:29.349
- Definitely.
- It was a smash.

01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:31.251
You got a standing "o."

01:31:31.253 --> 01:31:33.353
There were moms in the
audience who were crying.

01:31:33.355 --> 01:31:35.889
- They were crying. -Moms were crying?
I was sobbing.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.759
And that line about being a kid

01:31:39.761 --> 01:31:42.329
and growing up in New York...
I mean, come on.

01:31:42.331 --> 01:31:45.665
Oh. "Her bedtime was 8:30
in the city that never sleeps."

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:48.001
- That's the one.
- Great.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:49.503
I liked the kid who played dad.

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.106
What?

01:31:53.108 --> 01:31:54.508
Was it not about us?

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.244
It was about us, right?

01:31:58.305 --> 01:32:04.904
