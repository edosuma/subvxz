That's why.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.277
A new murmur can be
cause for concern,

17:25.344 --> 17:26.811
especially with your
recent dental work.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.146
It could be endocarditis.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.116
It's an infection
that can spread

17:31.183 --> 17:32.484
from the teeth to the heart.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.719
So we are gonna start you
on some antibiotics

17:33.786 --> 17:35.154
and run a couple of tests.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.156
Okay.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.057
How long have you had
the swollen lip?

17:40.359 --> 17:41.660
{\an6}JULIO:
I don't want to
talk about it.

17:41.727 --> 17:46.165
Okay. We'll get
those tests ordered.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.833
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

17:51.770 --> 17:53.238
(exhales sharply)

17:55.207 --> 17:57.709
Huh?

17:57.776 --> 17:58.744
(door closes)

17:58.811 --> 18:01.213
Huh.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.581
(chuckles)

18:04.416 --> 18:05.451
What are you doing in here?

18:05.517 --> 18:07.553
This isn't your
office anymore.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.522
Uh, looking for my white coat.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.124
I don't remember clearing you.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.759
Your physical isn't
for two more weeks.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.561
Come on, we both know I'm ready.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.696
Hey, feel that muscle.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.264
I am not feeling your muscle.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.332
{\an3}Come on, just
as a scientist.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.634
It's like a rock.
It's like the statue of David.

18:22.701 --> 18:23.702
Larry David.

18:23.769 --> 18:24.503
Griff, the rules

18:24.570 --> 18:26.271
governing
proctorship are serious,

18:26.338 --> 18:27.673
and if you disregard them,

18:27.739 --> 18:29.308
I have to answer
to the licensing board.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.176
We could put
the whole hospital at risk.

18:33.378 --> 18:35.113
{\an1}You'll be able to take histories
and talk to families.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.381
You can also be in the OR,

18:36.448 --> 18:38.417
but if you so much
as touch a patient,

18:38.484 --> 18:40.285
malpractice insurance
will drop you

18:40.352 --> 18:43.155
and your bony ass will lose
privileges at this hospital.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.724
Bony? You didn't even touch it.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.861
And for future reference,
coats are in the locker room.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.796
I don't deserve you as a wife.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.865
Probably why I've been married
elsewhere for eight years.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.633
Lucky man.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.703
Tell me something.
And be honest.

18:57.769 --> 18:58.837
Yeah?

18:58.904 --> 19:00.172
When you look at him,

19:00.239 --> 19:02.207
do you ever think

19:02.274 --> 19:04.209
his eyebrows look
like moustaches?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.716
Mr. Vargas's symptoms
are consistent with left-sided,

19:10.782 --> 19:13.719
native valve endocarditis,
status: post-dental implant.

19:13.785 --> 19:15.487
How did you lose the tooth?

19:15.554 --> 19:16.688
It got knocked out.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.924
Trust me, he deserved it.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.426
{\an1}LEX:
Blood cultures pending,

19:21.493 --> 19:23.295
we empirically started
an antibiotic course.

19:23.362 --> 19:25.297
But the fever persists. Why?

19:25.364 --> 19:26.932
Maybe the infection is
methicillin resistant?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.500
We could change to vanco?

19:28.567 --> 19:30.168
{\an5}Good. Anything else?

19:28.567 --> 19:30.168
{\an1}ISAN:
Could be

19:30.235 --> 19:31.670
{\an1}a deep space abscess
the antibiotics can't reach.

19:31.737 --> 19:33.505
I'd get a soft-tissue CT scan.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.540
I agree.

19:34.606 --> 19:35.874
{\an1}GRIFF:
I'm afraid I disagree.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.544
Who is that?

19:38.610 --> 19:40.445
Dr. Griffith.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.380
I thought <i> you</i> were Dr. Griffith.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.382
I am. And he is.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.651
We are Dr. Griffith.

19:45.717 --> 19:47.386
That's not confusing at all.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.921
{\an3}You didn't say he
was starting today.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.290
Your proctorship has not
officially begun, Doctor.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.426
Let's get Mr. Vargas
down to radiology.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.861
It's not endocarditis.

19:55.928 --> 19:56.895
Please don't interrupt me.

19:56.962 --> 19:58.830
Fever hasn't gone down...

19:59.898 --> 20:01.333
...has it?

20:06.305 --> 20:08.907
{\an5}SAM:
Okay, let's go through
the symptoms again.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.509
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to my whiteboard?

20:10.576 --> 20:11.710
{\an1}Oh.

20:11.777 --> 20:12.945
We upgraded.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.580
This can be updated in real time

20:14.646 --> 20:16.782
from any tablet
on the network.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.750
It promotes the sharing of
information across departments.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.420
{\an3}Well, I like to doodle
on my whiteboard.

20:21.486 --> 20:23.889
{\an1}Well, sorry for your loss.
What do we have?

20:23.956 --> 20:26.792
The constellation of symptoms
and clinical presentation

20:26.858 --> 20:28.760
really suggest
infective endocarditis.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.463
{\an5}GRIFF:
Well, I would be
inclined to agree.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.531
Oh, is that what you were doing
when you parachuted

20:32.598 --> 20:33.899
into the room just now?

20:33.966 --> 20:37.502
But not before ruling out
noninfective endocarditis.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.004
A.K.A. Libman-Sacks
endocarditis.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.472
{\an3}A.K.A....

20:40.539 --> 20:41.573
Lupus.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.808
Two diseases

20:42.874 --> 20:44.276
with almost identical symptoms.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.578
But totally opposite
treatment strategies.

20:46.645 --> 20:47.779
{\an1}If that's true, we've been
giving him antibiotics

20:47.846 --> 20:49.615
{\an1}when we should've been treating
him with immunosuppressants.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.783
(stammers)
What are you basing this on?

20:51.850 --> 20:54.686
Because Libman-Sacks is
characterized by lesions

20:54.753 --> 20:56.622
on the aortic valves, and his
transthoracic echo was clear.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.924
Echo imaging
is notoriously insensitive.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.627
We all know that, right?

21:01.693 --> 21:04.696
{\an3}Fine. In the spirit
of collaboration,

21:04.763 --> 21:07.299
I will order a coags
and a D.I.C. panel.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.634
Already did.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.969
Hey!
Excuse me?

21:11.036 --> 21:13.705
{\an1}Along with antinuclear
antibodies and ESR.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.841
You cannot order tests
without my authorization.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.277
Should we get him started
on Solu-Medrol? If it is

21:19.344 --> 21:20.445
{\an1}a lupus flare, we'll need
to deal with the inflammation.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.580
{\an3}ISAN:
That's a dangerous suggestion.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.416
{\an1}Suppressing
Mr. Vargas's immune system

21:24.483 --> 21:26.551
{\an3}if he's actually fighting an
infection would be catastrophic.

21:26.618 --> 21:29.821
Exactly. We wait for test
results before we change course.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.592
Well, looks like I got time
to doodle.

21:33.659 --> 21:35.327
(marker squeaking)

21:39.498 --> 21:42.434
♪ ♪

21:42.501 --> 21:43.902
(door opens)

21:46.438 --> 21:48.740
I thought I'd find you
down here.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.409
I was gonna ask
how you're doing,

21:50.475 --> 21:51.443
but it looks like you're
banging out a concerto, so...

21:52.844 --> 21:55.080
I wanted this to be
a fresh start.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.082
But this all feels
very familiar.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.719
Uh, do not let this affect
your confidence.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.689
These are famously difficult
conditions to differentiate.

22:03.755 --> 22:06.358
I'm sure that's exactly
what he'll say if he's right.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.360
Don't worry about
what he'll say.

22:08.427 --> 22:10.529
That's easy to say
when he's not your father.

22:10.595 --> 22:13.732
No. No, my father gambled
away my college tuition.

22:13.799 --> 22:16.068
{\an3}So you are not the only
one with daddy issues

22:16.134 --> 22:17.903
{\an5}around here, sweetheart.

22:16.134 --> 22:17.903
(chuckles)

22:17.969 --> 22:19.404
When you put it that way...

22:19.471 --> 22:20.806
{\an1}TECH:
Labs are ready.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.741
{\an1}Thank you.

22:27.646 --> 22:28.814
He was right.

22:30.949 --> 22:31.683
Damn it.

22:37.155 --> 22:40.425
{\an3}Thanks to Dr.
Griffith's diagnosis,

22:40.492 --> 22:41.793
{\an1}we have started you
on immunosuppressants

22:41.860 --> 22:43.395
and anticoagulants.

22:43.462 --> 22:44.563
{\an3}And we will keep
you here to monitor

22:44.629 --> 22:46.064
your overall heart function.

22:46.131 --> 22:47.566
I thought the other thing
affected my heart.

22:47.632 --> 22:49.801
This one can, too,
but in a different way.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.570
Thank you, Dr. Griffith.

22:51.636 --> 22:52.504
{\an5}You're welcome.

22:51.636 --> 22:52.504
You're welcome.

22:52.571 --> 22:53.872
I think he was talking to me.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.540
And yet, I was the one speaking.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.576
Julio,

22:57.642 --> 22:58.777
I know that your wife

22:58.844 --> 23:00.779
is the one
who knocked your tooth out.

23:00.846 --> 23:01.980
Would you mind telling me why?

23:02.047 --> 23:02.681
It's a long story.

23:02.748 --> 23:04.616
Well, if we only had the time.

23:04.683 --> 23:05.751
I have time.

23:05.817 --> 23:08.120
I got the thing.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.857
(sighs)

23:13.825 --> 23:15.093
I'm listening.

23:18.096 --> 23:19.030
What are you doing in here?

23:19.097 --> 23:20.665
Reading my eulogy.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.567
It's terrible.
You hardly even mention me.

23:22.634 --> 23:23.969
That's because it's not
your eulogy,

23:24.035 --> 23:25.036
it was my acceptance speech.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.705
{\an1}Dad.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.173
You cannot run out of the room

23:28.240 --> 23:29.407
when patients want to talk
anymore.

23:29.474 --> 23:30.675
It's not how I do things.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.745
So, what, it's your way
or the highway?

23:33.812 --> 23:35.881
It's my way because it works.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.849
If you'd followed protocols
and listened to Mr. Vargas,

23:37.916 --> 23:39.684
you would know that...

23:39.751 --> 23:40.752
That he cheated on his wife
and she decked him.

23:42.053 --> 23:42.821
I don't need
your protocols to solve

23:42.888 --> 23:44.089
that particular mystery.

23:45.624 --> 23:46.958
{\an1}You do have a lot of experience
to draw from,

23:47.025 --> 23:49.194
given what you did to Mom.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.962
I have work to do,
and this is my office,

23:51.029 --> 23:52.030
so if you could?

23:54.599 --> 23:56.802
(door opens, closes)

23:56.868 --> 23:58.603
Steroids are working.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.172
Inflammatory markers
are down everywhere.

24:00.238 --> 24:02.007
{\an1}Everywhere
but the sore on his lip.

24:02.073 --> 24:04.976
{\an1}What could cause that?
Dr. Costa.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.745
{\an3}He's immune-suppressed
from the treatment.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.747
{\an3}Could have left him susceptible
to a herpetic outbreak.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.182
But he came in with the sore.

24:10.248 --> 24:12.184
It was less pronounced,
but it preexisted treatment.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.084
So he got it from cheating,
and the immunosuppressants

24:13.151 --> 24:15.086
made it worse.

24:13.151 --> 24:15.086
Agreed.

24:15.153 --> 24:16.188
{\an1}Give him an ice pack,
some Valtrex.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.490
Let's move on.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.025
I am not ready to move on.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.693
It is the one symptom
that doesn't fit the diagnosis.

24:21.760 --> 24:22.928
Dr. Shah.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.596
{\an1}Could also be
hereditary angioedema.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.599
Oh, a man has an affair,

24:27.666 --> 24:29.134
turns up with a sore on his lip.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.770
{\an3}STD or a rare
genetic disorder?

24:31.837 --> 24:32.637
Is this about the patient's lip,

24:32.704 --> 24:35.207
{\an3}or needing to be right
about something?

24:40.045 --> 24:42.080
{\an5}CALEB:
<i>All I'm saying is, Rob Griffith</i>
<i>is gonna get his job back.</i>

24:42.147 --> 24:44.983
Sam's just signing her
own pink slip by helping him.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.918
Mm. You should tell her that.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.587
It'll really help your
getting back together cause.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.155
{\an3}LEX (laughs):
Getting back together?

24:50.222 --> 24:52.123
After he wouldn't commit?
Please.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.525
Separate issue.

24:53.592 --> 24:54.626
{\an5}Really?
ISAN:
Is it?

24:54.693 --> 24:56.695
Sam was your girlfriend.
You know better than anybody

24:56.761 --> 24:59.030
{\an5}how hard he was on her.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.030
Yeah, and I also know

24:59.097 --> 25:02.100
that she put up with it
for the same reason we all did.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.668
Griff was tough, okay?

25:03.735 --> 25:07.172
But he's also the best.
He makes us better.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.241
{\an3}You are really a
black-belt ass-kisser.

25:09.307 --> 25:10.542
You know that?

25:10.609 --> 25:11.509
He made me miserable.

25:12.911 --> 25:14.880
Sam's made
the whole place better.

25:14.946 --> 25:16.648
We are all happier.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.750
We get more sleep,
we're more effective.

25:18.817 --> 25:20.852
Okay, Isan, you have to have

25:20.919 --> 25:22.654
open-heart surgery tomorrow.

25:22.721 --> 25:24.756
Which Dr. Griffith
do you choose?

25:24.823 --> 25:27.692
Anybody who opens my chest
has to be a good person

25:27.759 --> 25:29.127
and a good doctor.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.029
(all groaning)

25:31.096 --> 25:32.597
JOEY:
You know what?

25:32.664 --> 25:34.065
{\an5}You're in time-out.

25:32.664 --> 25:34.065
(laughter)

25:39.304 --> 25:40.572
(door closes)

25:43.308 --> 25:46.678
Oh, hello.
Hey.

25:46.745 --> 25:49.314
You are officially the first
administrative executive

25:49.381 --> 25:51.683
to ever set foot in this lab.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.985
Look, I was thinking about
asking you to dinner.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.720
But I received

25:55.787 --> 25:59.057
a tip that you rarely leave
the hospital for meals,

25:59.124 --> 26:01.593
and that if I wanted some
alone time with you,

26:01.660 --> 26:04.229
I'd have to get it in the lab
after hours.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.799
My office is next to your mom's.

26:07.866 --> 26:09.801
Ah.

26:09.868 --> 26:11.603
Do you always prep
your own lab work?

26:11.670 --> 26:13.838
Uh, just when the lab
is backed up.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.807
Makes sense. Why wait?

26:15.874 --> 26:17.208
Hate waiting.

26:17.275 --> 26:18.677
Speaking of, when were
you gonna ask me to dinner?

26:18.743 --> 26:20.245
(both laugh)

26:20.312 --> 26:22.280
{\an5}MAN (over P.A.): Code blue.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.280
Oh, no.

26:22.347 --> 26:23.782
{\an5}It's your patient?

26:22.347 --> 26:23.782
It's Julio. He's coding.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.890
{\an3}He was responding to treatment,
so why the cardiogenic shock?

26:31.957 --> 26:33.124
Ooh, ooh, miss.

26:33.191 --> 26:34.092
If you say lesions
on his valves...

26:34.159 --> 26:35.894
Lesions on his valves.

26:35.961 --> 26:37.329
{\an1}Jinx.

26:37.395 --> 26:39.364
Lactate and blood cultures
were negative.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.865
What are we missing?

26:40.932 --> 26:42.233
Preexisting malignancy, maybe?

26:42.300 --> 26:44.836
{\an1}Or an undiagnosed
thrombotic disorder?

26:44.903 --> 26:46.171
{\an4}GRIFF:
For months, I was here
in this hospital,

26:46.237 --> 26:46.972
while you all carried on
without me.

26:47.038 --> 26:48.840
{\an1}There was no evidence
of me at all.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.209
If you wanted to find me, you
would have had to go looking.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.111
{\an1}Like with
a transesophageal echo?

26:54.412 --> 26:56.214
No. We just got
him stabilized.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.149
It would answer the question.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.884
And it's relatively low-risk.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.954
It is not low-risk.
His ejection fraction is at 35%.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.155
(scoffs)

27:04.222 --> 27:06.658
Well, why don't we take a vote?

27:06.725 --> 27:07.392
All in favor
of a diagnostic test...

27:07.459 --> 27:08.927
An unnecessary diagnostic test.

27:08.994 --> 27:10.962
{\an1}...a diagnostic test
to find out

27:11.029 --> 27:12.163
what's actually going on?

27:27.112 --> 27:29.381
Slow down, Sam.

27:29.447 --> 27:31.016
Talk to me.
No.

27:31.082 --> 27:33.385
Since when do we vote on risky,
invasive procedures?

27:33.451 --> 27:34.853
This is not a democracy.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.021
I know, but...

27:36.087 --> 27:37.422
No, I have to do a TEE
on a patient now

27:37.489 --> 27:39.124
because the Almighty Griff
can't fathom

27:39.190 --> 27:40.925
that he could possibly be wrong?

27:40.992 --> 27:41.893
He's not wrong.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.295
{\an1}Three sets of bacterial cultures
were negative.

27:44.362 --> 27:45.997
We are missing something, Lex.

27:46.064 --> 27:46.965
{\an5}Sam.

27:46.064 --> 27:46.965
{\an3}I know it.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.933
I know it.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.301
He was right.

27:50.368 --> 27:51.736
{\an1}And I know

27:51.803 --> 27:53.071
it's hard to not
make this personal, but...

27:53.138 --> 27:55.807
That's what you think I'm doing?

27:55.874 --> 27:57.175
I think that you are being
very emotional,

27:57.242 --> 27:59.044
and it's possibly
clouding your judgment.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.679
Huh.

28:01.746 --> 28:04.049
Yeah, maybe my judgment is off.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.183
(exhales)

28:05.250 --> 28:06.217
Because I thought my best friend

28:06.284 --> 28:07.318
would have my back.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.257
♪ ♪

28:19.798 --> 28:21.332
(exhales)

28:35.346 --> 28:37.348
We're looking
in the wrong place.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.253
Tricuspid valve appears intact.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.354
{\an3}CALEB:
Same with the pulmonic.

28:43.421 --> 28:44.756
Valves look fine.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.925
Exactly. There's nothing here.

28:46.991 --> 28:48.860
So I'm here for you to say,
"I told you so, Doctor..."

28:48.927 --> 28:50.929
That is not why I agreed
to this procedure, Doctor.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.797
It's not the valves
we need to see.

28:52.864 --> 28:54.232
It's what's around them.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.301
Like the failing ventricle.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.770
What failing ventricle?

28:58.837 --> 28:59.838
Go transgastric?

29:01.106 --> 29:02.440
The myocardium's dead.

29:02.507 --> 29:04.109
I-It's going after the muscle.

29:04.175 --> 29:05.877
{\an6}CALEB:
Lupus doesn't
attack heart muscle.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.781
{\an1}Which means
we're missing something.

29:09.848 --> 29:12.117
Exactly. This has nothing
to do with his valves,

29:12.183 --> 29:14.119
but unless we figure out
what this is,

29:14.185 --> 29:15.487
he's gonna need
a whole new heart.

29:17.522 --> 29:19.357
(siren wailing)

29:25.964 --> 29:27.899
Daisy, I relate to living
next to someone

29:27.966 --> 29:31.236
you'd like to punch more
than you can possibly imagine.

29:33.338 --> 29:38.042
But Julio needs your help
right now, and so do I.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.411
Will you tell me the story?

29:40.478 --> 29:43.014
{\an5}Your version?

29:40.478 --> 29:43.014
There's nothing to tell.

29:43.081 --> 29:45.917
Julio came home from Rio
with that sore on his lip.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.786
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.786
{\an1}He tried to hide it,
but I saw it.

29:48.853 --> 29:51.122
By the time he confessed,
I was so angry, I punched him.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.557
Right in the mouth.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.160
The business trip
where Julio had the affair,

29:55.226 --> 29:57.562
where did you say it was?

29:57.629 --> 30:01.232
Rio de Janeiro saw
a dramatic uptick

30:01.299 --> 30:04.169
{\an3}in cases of <i> Trypanosoma</i>
<i>cruzi</i> over the last decade.

30:04.235 --> 30:06.404
Cruzi? Sounds like a girl
I dated in college.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.039
It's a parasite.

30:08.106 --> 30:10.074
It's infected over
six million people in Brazil.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.410
Which is where Mr. Vargas
had his affair,

30:12.477 --> 30:14.579
which is where he was
likely bitten by an insect

30:14.646 --> 30:17.882
carrying <i> T. cruzi,</i> which
then likely entered his system

30:17.949 --> 30:19.083
through the insect's feces.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.585
So it bites you
and then it poops on you?

30:20.652 --> 30:21.920
{\an5}Uh-huh.
JOEY:
You definitely

30:21.986 --> 30:23.221
dated that girl.

30:23.288 --> 30:24.422
The insect targets
mucous membranes

30:24.489 --> 30:26.457
of the face,
like the eyes and the lips.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.426
It's actually nicknamed
the kissing bug.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.128
{\an5}Yes.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.128
That explains the lip.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.564
Exactly. The STD

30:32.630 --> 30:35.099
{\an3}is actually an
acute-phase symptom

30:35.166 --> 30:37.502
of Chagas disease.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.837
{\an1}Ah, so wait, the inflammation
that we diagnosed as lupus w...

30:39.904 --> 30:42.106
Was another symptom.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.108
{\an3}An immune response to the
tissue-nested parasite.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.243
I'll confirm
with antibody tests.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.244
{\an5}Start an antiparasitic.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.244
{\an3}I'm on it.

30:46.311 --> 30:47.912
{\an1}GRIFF:
It's too late.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.149
The troponin levels
are sky-high.

30:51.216 --> 30:54.852
Massive myocyte necrosis.
Cell death.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.589
So we put him
on the transplant list.

30:57.655 --> 30:59.224
Ventricular-assist
device as a bridge.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.125
{\an5}He's a young man...

30:59.290 --> 31:01.125
Never gonna happen in time.

31:01.192 --> 31:04.128
The family needs to start
saying goodbye.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.966
{\an3}SAM:
Give us a minute?

31:08.032 --> 31:09.167
Okay...

31:09.234 --> 31:10.368
(door opens)

31:10.435 --> 31:12.904
(door closes)

31:12.971 --> 31:14.105
Why are you doing this?

31:14.172 --> 31:15.406
The heart is gone.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.277
You have to be able to call it.

31:19.344 --> 31:22.313
Not the case. This.

31:23.414 --> 31:25.149
You don't respect my authority,

31:25.216 --> 31:26.951
or my rules.

31:27.018 --> 31:28.152
So why not work
under someone else?

31:28.219 --> 31:29.921
Somewhere else?

31:29.988 --> 31:33.424
Because you need me.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.661
It's actually
the other way around.

31:39.130 --> 31:41.266
"I can handle him," I said.
"He won't get under my skin."

31:41.332 --> 31:43.268
I can barely hold
my team together.

31:43.334 --> 31:45.570
Well, they're confused.

31:45.637 --> 31:49.307
He was the boss for a long time,
but he is not in charge.

31:49.374 --> 31:50.541
Well, that's not what he thinks.

31:50.608 --> 31:51.576
What do you think?

31:51.643 --> 31:53.311
(stammers)

31:53.378 --> 31:55.413
I think that my entire
management approach was naive.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.081
{\an3}I think that,
ultimately,

31:57.148 --> 32:00.018
unfortunately, people
respect tyrants and bullies

32:00.084 --> 32:01.586
more than kindness and decency.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.021
That's not respect.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.156
{\an5}It's fear.

32:03.087 --> 32:05.156
{\an3}I thought

32:05.223 --> 32:07.659
that the whole almost dying
thing would change him.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.661
Not a lot, but a little.

32:09.727 --> 32:12.463
Something in him is broken, Sam.

32:12.530 --> 32:13.665
Since the accident...

32:13.731 --> 32:16.200
I don't want to talk
about the accident.

32:16.267 --> 32:19.070
Okay? That can't be the excuse
for everything forever.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.240
He was speeding. So what?

32:22.307 --> 32:25.109
What happened to me, my heart,
that wasn't his fault.

32:25.176 --> 32:27.545
And besides, if you feel badly
for hurting someone,

32:27.612 --> 32:31.316
you don't push them away,
you try to make it better.

32:31.382 --> 32:34.419
You do that.

32:34.485 --> 32:36.454
You try to make things better.

32:49.233 --> 32:52.370
Sam. What-what are you
doing here?

32:52.437 --> 32:55.106
I'm sorry that I took my
frustration out on you earlier.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.507
And I brought you
a peace offering.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.012
What, do you have company?

33:01.079 --> 33:02.380
{\an5}(chuckles)

33:01.079 --> 33:02.380
Look,

33:02.447 --> 33:04.248
I wanted to tell you.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.516
Tell me what?

33:05.583 --> 33:07.719
I-It started
before the shooting.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.054
And, look, I know it
shouldn't have, but it did.

33:10.121 --> 33:11.689
But it is over now.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.591
It may not look that way.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.260
It probably looks

33:16.327 --> 33:18.363
{\an3}really bad.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.366
We should've told you.

33:21.432 --> 33:22.200
"We"?

33:22.266 --> 33:25.169
{\an4}Yeah.

33:22.266 --> 33:25.169
Uh-- I-I should have told you.

33:25.236 --> 33:26.237
There is no we.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.206
All right, look, if I may...

33:28.272 --> 33:31.008
No. You may not.

33:31.075 --> 33:33.344
At least, not with me.

33:37.248 --> 33:39.050
Find someone else
to proctor you.

33:43.087 --> 33:44.355
(door closes)

33:57.635 --> 33:59.570
What do you mean,
there's nothing you can do?

33:59.637 --> 34:01.172
I have to uphold
the chain of command

34:01.239 --> 34:02.440
the same as I did
when you were attending.

34:02.507 --> 34:05.510
I can't force Sam
to proctor you.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.044
You're insubordinate
and disrespectful.

34:07.111 --> 34:08.478
Please, Vivi.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.281
Don't.

34:10.348 --> 34:13.184
Surgery is the only time
i-it's quiet in my head.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.585
You know that.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.754
{\an5}Then go somewhere else.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.754
{\an1}Listen.

34:16.821 --> 34:21.391
I... I can make her stronger.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.428
{\an5}Better.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.428
{\an3}Really?

34:23.494 --> 34:26.597
A resident, Griff?
Sam's best friend.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.399
I know, I know.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.301
What do I do?

34:30.368 --> 34:33.271
Just tell me what to do.

34:35.639 --> 34:38.275
Make this right
with your daughter.

34:38.342 --> 34:41.478
Be her father.
Stop hiding behind your work.

34:41.545 --> 34:45.149
This is how I'm her father.
I've always been like this.

34:45.216 --> 34:46.583
No, not always.

34:46.650 --> 34:47.752
Oh, no, not that again.

34:47.819 --> 34:50.420
You need professional help.

34:50.487 --> 34:53.123
You can't see how
the accident affected

34:53.190 --> 34:54.292
your relationship with her.

34:54.358 --> 34:55.326
You have blocked it out.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.661
Stop.

34:56.726 --> 34:58.229
{\an1}What is this,
a-a memory test?

34:58.296 --> 34:59.430
I remember,

34:59.497 --> 35:02.133
remember leaving the lake house,

35:02.200 --> 35:05.136
I was driving too fast
around the bend,

35:05.203 --> 35:09.407
watching our daughter
getting wheeled into surgery.

35:11.242 --> 35:14.312
Heart surgery, which I think
we both agree was, uh...

35:14.378 --> 35:15.546
Yeah, it was traumatic.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.548
I was gonna say ironic.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.284
Give me your badge.

35:20.351 --> 35:22.286
Come on.

35:27.391 --> 35:28.626
(door opens)

35:37.935 --> 35:40.605
My father and I disagree
about a lot of things.

35:40.671 --> 35:43.307
Including what we see
in each of you.

35:43.374 --> 35:44.675
So here's what I see.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.345
Inspiring confidence.

35:48.613 --> 35:51.382
{\an3}Wisdom and
compassion.

35:51.449 --> 35:53.484
Commitment, courage

35:53.551 --> 35:55.286
and a complexion
that I truly envy.

35:59.957 --> 36:02.760
A brilliant doctor
who I need on this team.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.229
Right now, this patient
is all there is.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.600
So, if you are with me,
let's get to work.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.305
Lex, do a lit search on
the most up-to-date treatments

36:14.372 --> 36:15.540
for Chagas,
even experimental ones.

36:15.606 --> 36:18.175
{\an3}Joey, get him into the
transplant network.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.378
Isan and Caleb,
start him on inotropes

36:20.444 --> 36:22.413
{\an3}and get a Swan-Ganz cath
into him right away.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.581
This is not over.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.361
{\an1}Julio's in the transplant
registry, status 1A.

36:37.428 --> 36:38.796
And I ordered a CBC.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.264
If we get a hit,
we'll be ready.

36:40.331 --> 36:42.300
Thank you, Caleb.

36:43.601 --> 36:44.902
Second chances.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.571
{\an5}Excuse me?

36:44.969 --> 36:46.571
{\an1}Just,

36:46.637 --> 36:49.340
your dad, and this patient.

36:49.407 --> 36:50.775
You don't give up on people.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.278
Which I'm hoping

36:54.345 --> 36:56.280
is also true in my case.

36:58.816 --> 37:01.218
You caught me off guard
back then.

37:01.285 --> 37:02.920
And after everything
that happened,

37:02.987 --> 37:05.222
I never got the chance
to take it back.

37:06.857 --> 37:08.559
Uh, what are you saying?

37:08.626 --> 37:10.361
(pager beeps, buzzes)

37:11.896 --> 37:14.298
{\an1}Mount Sinai Dearborn
had a failed transplant.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.300
Doesn't say what happened,
but they saw our request.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.235
{\an5}They're sending it.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.235
There's a heart.

37:18.302 --> 37:19.503
{\an5}It's en route.

37:18.302 --> 37:19.503
What are we doing here?

37:21.038 --> 37:22.707
(helicopter whirring)

37:38.322 --> 37:40.491
{\an5}LEX:
Perfusing fluid.
Vessels are cold.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.828
SAM:
Dr. Tucker, we're ready.

37:45.763 --> 37:46.998
{\an3}No.

37:47.064 --> 37:48.432
That cannot be right.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.369
I thought it was a match.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.337
Blood type is, but the donor's
BMI is, like, 16.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.572
It's too small.

37:54.639 --> 37:55.673
Bet that's why Mount Sinai
didn't want it.

37:55.740 --> 37:56.874
This heart's garbage.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.410
No, it isn't.
We have to make it work.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.547
(phone ringing)

38:09.820 --> 38:10.855
Yeah?

38:13.491 --> 38:14.859
The heart's too small?

38:14.925 --> 38:15.860
{\an6}SAM:
If I abort and wait
for the right heart,

38:15.926 --> 38:17.294
{\an6}he dies.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.294
I agree.

38:17.361 --> 38:18.763
And if I transplant that heart,
it'll fail

38:18.829 --> 38:20.931
{\an5}before I close up.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.931
Agree again.

38:20.998 --> 38:21.732
{\an3}Neither of these hearts
can keep him alive.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.768
Three in a row.
Why'd you call me?

38:23.834 --> 38:26.070
Because maybe both of them can.

38:28.506 --> 38:29.874
A heterotopic transplant?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.776
That procedure's so rare
it's almost a myth.

38:31.842 --> 38:32.576
He's done it.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.612
Y-You know I can't
perform surgery.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.313
So talk me through it.

38:36.380 --> 38:39.583
The connection
between atria is essential.

38:39.650 --> 38:42.319
If it's not exact, he'll either
embolize or bleed out.

38:42.386 --> 38:45.823
Good thing he's in the hands
of a capable surgeon.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.530
Dad.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.702
Clamp.

38:57.768 --> 39:00.604
Little pericardial flap
on the right side,

39:00.671 --> 39:02.740
above the diaphragm.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.942
{\an3}11 blade.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.011
{\an1}11.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.846
{\an1}Transverse incision
should be at the sternum,

39:08.913 --> 39:10.047
over the diaphragm...

39:10.114 --> 39:12.683
{\an3}To here.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.719
GRIFF:
Okay.

39:14.785 --> 39:16.754
Ooh, slow... slow down,
slow down.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.723
Okay, watch out for fragments.
There you go.

39:20.891 --> 39:21.792
{\an4}All right.

39:20.891 --> 39:21.792
Ready for the graft.

39:21.859 --> 39:22.727
GRIFF:
Mm-hmm.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.667
{\an1}Start the anastomosis
at the posterior portion

39:29.734 --> 39:32.570
of both left atria.

39:32.636 --> 39:33.971
{\an1}You want to terminate
the sutures...

39:34.038 --> 39:36.040
On the anterior edges.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.141
{\an3}You want as large a
connection as possible.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.110
{\an3}Okay. The atrial pathway
should be clear.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.446
{\an3}Come on.

39:45.549 --> 39:46.784
Come on, come on.

39:50.020 --> 39:51.622
(Sam exhales)

39:51.689 --> 39:53.090

39:54.825 --> 39:56.160

39:58.963 --> 39:59.997

40:19.750 --> 40:22.086
Lucky, lucky man.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.821
Could easily have died.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.794
I think what
you're trying to say

40:29.860 --> 40:31.896
is "well done."

Look, if...

40:36.634 --> 40:40.504
I have been hard on you,

40:40.571 --> 40:43.908
it's only because you have
tremendous potential.

40:43.974 --> 40:45.743
I want to help you realize it.

40:45.810 --> 40:49.947
I want to teach you
how to realize it.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.782
That's my job as a father.

40:51.849 --> 40:54.885
No, that's your job
as a surgeon.

40:58.055 --> 41:01.525
{\an3}Maybe I-I
haven't always

41:01.592 --> 41:04.995
been there for you,
the way you would've wanted...

41:05.062 --> 41:07.164
Dad, you have never
been there for me.

41:08.933 --> 41:10.901
At least,
not in a very long time.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.070
{\an1}But you were there
for this.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.805
Today.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.507
And we saved a man's life.

41:16.574 --> 41:19.210
Yeah.

41:19.276 --> 41:21.111
Oh...

41:23.848 --> 41:25.583
I've decided to continue
proctoring you,

41:25.649 --> 41:27.818
if that's what you want.

41:31.689 --> 41:33.958
Yes. Please.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.996
I want to be very clear.

41:39.063 --> 41:42.933
I am making this decision
as a doctor.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.836
As your daughter?
I'm calling it.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.112
That'll be all, Doctor.
