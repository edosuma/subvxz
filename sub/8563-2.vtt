WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
There were long
piers on Guadalcanal

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and we really and truly
figured none of us

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Will survive err,
that... we were expandable.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The Japanese navy came in

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and sank all of our escorts.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The American navy suffered one of
their worst defeats in history.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And our supplies, food

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and most of our ammunition
went down with it.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
By September of 1942,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
the marines had been left to fight
the battle for Guadalcanal alone.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
They were vastly under supplied.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And many were on the
verge of starvation.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
We knew that our navy
had left and that

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
the Japanese had
control of the sea.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And that they can
supply their troops,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and we... we couldn't.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
With thousand of Japanese reinforcements
pouring onto the island...

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The marines were strafed
and bombed continuously.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Pressure was on us
from the Japanese,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
24 hours a day,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and they bombed every day

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
in big formations.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
They just kept coming in

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and guns just pounding.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
At the mercy of the
Japanese bombers,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
and without any naval support,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
the marines' battle
get another enemy:

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
the jungle on Guadalcanal.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The jungle on Guadalcanal

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
was practically impenetrable.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The malaria was vicious,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
boys would come down with chills,
half temperature was 105F.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The whole Gudalcanal campaign was

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
one of near starvation
as I recall it.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
After enduring more than a
month of jungle warfare.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The marines faced the Japanese offensive
to retake their lost airfield.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
On Guadalcanal I
developed a sort of a...

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
formula in life,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
in which there're times,
that you just pray and hold on.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
And that's what we
did on Guadalcanal.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Repeatedly,

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
we just pray and hold on.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Eugene, I-- I'm sorry.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Murmur's still there.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The boy's disappointed.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I wish we were going together.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I joined the marines.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Take care of yourself.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Maybe I'll write you.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The pacific will be
our theater of war.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
The marines will do
battle with the Japs

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
on tiny specs of turf that
we have never heard of.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Welcome to Guadalcanal.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Let's assume the japs are watching
right now, preparing to come at us.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Assume? They are.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Wait? Look, look, look.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Stay down! Stay down!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Look at 'em all.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
They just kept on coming.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Morning, boys.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Colonel Puller!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
- Where you headin'?
- Tokyo.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Care to join us?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I don't know. It's away, sir.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
Write us when you get there.

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
I will!

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
You seen those guys?

00:00.000 --> 00:00.000
They look like they been
through the wringer.

00:00.000 --> 02:35.843
That's one way of putting it.

Are you hit?

05:29.754 --> 05:31.855
No.

05:52.295 --> 05:55.664
Chesty wants your squad to hang back with
able company, see if the nips follow us.

05:55.698 --> 05:58.633
Then we'll rejoin the battalion
further north. - Yeah.

Supper's on. Supper's on.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.363
Got anything good?

06:37.397 --> 06:41.533

- Army rations from 1918.

06:43.502 --> 06:46.003
<i>Quartermaster over in dog company</i>

06:46.037 --> 06:48.138
Claims they're edible.

06:52.142 --> 06:54.876

for about an hour or two.

06:54.911 --> 06:57.644
This is all you could find?

06:57.679 --> 06:59.546

Oh, that's presely
what I need to hear.

07:36.868 --> 07:38.969
Tell her how handsome I am.

07:39.003 --> 07:40.970
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

07:41.004 --> 07:42.971
We've been swallowed by the jungle

07:43.005 --> 07:45.906
And 5,000 japs waiting to kill us.

07:51.377 --> 07:54.079
Hey, thanks for
brightening the mood.

O. And pancakes.

08:42.049 --> 08:44.082
What do you got
against aunt jemima?

08:44.117 --> 08:46.851
Jap navy sails up and down this
slot every night and plasters us.

08:46.885 --> 08:48.551
That don't got nothing
to do with her.

08:48.585 --> 08:50.618
The only radio reports I wanna hear

08:50.653 --> 08:53.086
Is that a bunch of jap ships
have been sunk somewhere

08:53.120 --> 08:55.021
Off some crappy island
called guadalcanal.

08:55.055 --> 08:56.755
<i>But we'd need the navy for that,
wouldn't we?</i>

08:56.790 --> 08:59.723
- So fat chance.
- Come on.  Hey hey.

08:59.758 --> 09:02.125
So the japs got us surrounded.

09:02.159 --> 09:03.593
Is that what's buggin' you?

09:03.628 --> 09:06.696
John, I shit like 20 times a day.
My ass is killing me.

09:06.730 --> 09:08.197
Jp's in a bad mood, manny.

09:08.231 --> 09:10.299
Next he'll be complaining
about the mosquitoes.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.733
Come here.

09:11.767 --> 09:13.802
Hot chow'll cheer you up.

09:23.639 --> 09:25.274
Think of it as meat.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.643
- Fuck it.
- Next.

09:30.478 --> 09:33.878
<i>Boys, division just translated
some jap newspapers</i>

09:33.913 --> 09:37.584
That was found on the other
side of the matanikau.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.986
Would you care to know
what the nips think of us?

09:40.020 --> 09:41.654
Yes, sir.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.226
"the americans on this island

09:45.261 --> 09:50.033
Are not ordinary troops, but ma,

09:50.067 --> 09:53.703
A special force
recruited from jails

09:53.738 --> 09:56.471
And insane asylums for bloodlust."

09:59.006 --> 10:01.507
They got that right.

10:01.541 --> 10:04.077
<i>I got some more good news.</i>

10:04.112 --> 10:07.548
Rumors that they would never
get here are to the contrary.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.083
The army just landed.

10:09.117 --> 10:11.784
I know, I know.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.622
I want every man in my
battalion shaved by 1600.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.323
Yes, sir.

10:17.357 --> 10:20.325
I guess there ain't nothing much
we can do about our dungarees.

10:21.593 --> 10:25.829
I figure we're just
raggedy-ass marines.

10:25.864 --> 10:29.699
We look this way for a reason.
Yes, sir.

10:31.868 --> 10:33.735
We can't do it if they don't run.

10:33.769 --> 10:36.437
Jesus christ, evans,

10:36.472 --> 10:39.474
Kinda looks like her too,

Hey, fuck you!

10:46.182 --> 10:48.850
Fuck you guys. - Put your

10:48.884 --> 10:51.386
- Thanks for coming, guys.

The army don't know e
japs bomb the airfield,

11:19.148 --> 11:21.783
But not the beach.

11:21.818 --> 11:23.952
Stay low, get greedy.

11:23.986 --> 11:26.554
Let's go. Come on.

<i>Man #3: Jackpot, boys!</i>

11:46.644 --> 11:48.445
Come on, jp, get it in the bag.

Get it in, get it in.
Come on, jp, come on.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.001
<i>Get moving!</i>

12:21.539 --> 12:23.407
Army gets the new stuff
and we fight with shit

12:23.441 --> 12:25.108
My grandfather used.

12:25.142 --> 12:28.143
Hey, guys! Look what I got.

12:28.178 --> 12:30.946
Hah! Crackers.

12:30.980 --> 12:33.214
Look at this. Give me a hand.
I got it.

12:33.249 --> 12:35.283
<i>- Hey, you there, halt!

12:37.086 --> 12:38.953
<i>- Come on, jp.

12:38.987 --> 12:41.688
Stop right there.
That's army gear. Halt!

12:43.491 --> 12:46.093
- Try and catch us.
- Thanks for the chow.

12:49.832 --> 12:51.900
Here.

12:51.934 --> 12:54.035
There you go.

12:59.641 --> 13:02.509
- Private leckie.
- Sir.

13:02.544 --> 13:05.011
The army captain from
the 164th's raising hell

13:05.045 --> 13:07.012
About somebody
breaking into his trunk

13:07.047 --> 13:10.148
And stealing a box
of cigars and shoes.

13:10.183 --> 13:11.581
Not just any shoes.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.880
Said they were his
favorite pair of moccasins.

13:19.154 --> 13:23.020
Well, that's bad luck
for that captain.

13:23.054 --> 13:25.518
Yeah, well, you might wanna
watch where you wear those

13:25.552 --> 13:28.450
Or smoke any cigars
you might not have.

13:34.658 --> 13:37.460
Or drink any hooch
you might not have.

13:37.494 --> 13:40.995
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

13:43.430 --> 13:45.431
Anything happen while
I was prospecting?

13:45.465 --> 13:48.533
Betty hutton stopped
by giving out blowjobs.

13:48.568 --> 13:51.304
What'd you get?

13:51.338 --> 13:53.606
Well, these...

13:54.976 --> 13:56.877
Are for me.

13:56.912 --> 13:59.846
But if you're nice and mind your manners,
I might give you a puff.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.514
These...

14:02.583 --> 14:04.350
Are for you miscreants.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.587
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, yeah.

14:07.756 --> 14:09.356
Traded the crackers with f company.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.458
- Hey, peaches.
- Peaches?

14:11.492 --> 14:13.558
I got the goddamn runs and
you had to get peaches.

14:13.593 --> 14:15.525
They were all out
of cheese, runner.

14:21.565 --> 14:24.298
<i>Oh, my god, these .</i>

14:24.333 --> 14:28.032
<i>Ah, where have you been all my life,
you beautiful can?</i>

14:28.067 --> 14:29.733
Ah.

14:52.381 --> 14:54.846
Peaches. Your new name is peaches.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.245
- Fuck you.
- You got it, peaches.

15:00.046 --> 15:03.844
You gotta write vera about this.

15:15.618 --> 15:18.019
Runner,

15:18.053 --> 15:20.554
Your new nickname is old faithful.

15:20.589 --> 15:22.055
Fuck you, peaches.

15:32.730 --> 15:35.164
Bud... Bud, we gotta go.

15:35.198 --> 15:37.432
Come on, bud! Come on! We gotta go!

15:43.838 --> 15:46.940
- Ahh!
- Shit.

15:51.345 --> 15:54.914
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

15:54.948 --> 15:57.616
Son of a bitch!

16:06.992 --> 16:08.826
Fuck!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.730
You're okay. We're
gonna make it through.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.432
<i>- You're okay. You're okay.
- Shit.</i>

16:18.635 --> 16:20.770
Shit!

16:24.007 --> 16:26.641
- I ain't going anywhere.
- God damn it!

16:26.675 --> 16:29.076
Fuck you, fuck you!

16:29.111 --> 16:32.079
<i>Ahh!</i>

16:45.690 --> 16:47.657
<i>- Basilone: Sound off!
- Lapointe.</i>

16:47.691 --> 16:49.624
<i>- Evans.
- Upton.</i>

16:49.658 --> 16:51.792
<i>Garland.</i>

16:53.826 --> 16:56.961
Come on, get up.

16:59.431 --> 17:01.500
Help me out.

17:01.534 --> 17:03.502
I got him.

17:09.809 --> 17:12.949
Evans.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.389
- Start digging out.
- I can't, I can't.

17:18.423 --> 17:21.263
<i>- Miller.
- Garcia.</i>

17:39.490 --> 17:41.324
<i>Let's go. Keep looking for bodies.</i>

17:41.359 --> 17:43.526
<i>Man #2: What about the jeeps?</i>

18:19.179 --> 18:21.546
<i>Direct hit.</i>

18:22.980 --> 18:25.648
Some little jap lady,
weapons plant--

18:25.682 --> 18:30.156
<i>She puts in five more grams
of explosives.</i>

18:30.190 --> 18:32.359
<i>Man, that could've been us.</i>

18:33.961 --> 18:37.095
Basilone, manny, jp.

18:38.964 --> 18:41.364
Briggs, what is it?

18:44.901 --> 18:47.269
<i>Briggs.</i>

18:47.303 --> 18:50.372
Chesty wants dog
company ncos at his cp.

18:59.256 --> 19:02.193
<i>Our battalion will join hanneken's</i>

19:02.228 --> 19:05.097
<i>In our old position south
of the airfield.</i>

19:05.131 --> 19:07.632
Now it's been a quiet sector.

19:07.667 --> 19:08.800
It's rough terrain.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.602
Topside thinks the japs

19:11.636 --> 19:13.603
Are going to attack
up by the matanikau,

19:13.638 --> 19:15.505
Hoping that they
can run their armor

19:15.540 --> 19:18.007
Up the coast road right
into the airfield.

19:18.042 --> 19:22.945
If that happens,
they might pull hanneken,

19:22.979 --> 19:27.883
Put him up north to reinforce
the 5th and the 1st marines.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.785
And that is gonna leave us alone,

19:30.819 --> 19:33.020
Singled up on the line.

19:33.055 --> 19:37.690
Now if the japs do break through

19:37.725 --> 19:39.992
And they retake the airfield,

19:40.026 --> 19:42.260
Our orders are to
take to the jungles

19:42.294 --> 19:44.995
<i>And fight as guerrillas.</i>

19:45.030 --> 19:47.931
This is not going to happen.

19:47.965 --> 19:49.632
Aye aye, sir.

19:51.601 --> 19:54.235
Move your men to the
line at sector 3.

19:54.270 --> 19:55.837
- Get it done.
- Men: Aye aye, sir!

19:55.871 --> 19:58.806
Basilone, you and
rodriguez stay behind.

20:02.776 --> 20:05.010
<i>Listen, can you spare this hombre?</i>

20:05.044 --> 20:07.445
I need ather runner.

20:10.782 --> 20:12.916
Hell, colonel, we're sick of him.

20:14.151 --> 20:16.018
Get your shit.
Meet me back at the cp.

20:16.052 --> 20:17.552
Aye aye, sir.

20:20.588 --> 20:22.255
Good luck, man.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.095
Hanneken's being pulled
up north to the matanikau.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.630
Japs will make their push up there.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.999
Where's briggs headed?

20:35.033 --> 20:37.501
<i>Setting up an outpost
south of the line.</i>

20:37.536 --> 20:40.304
Fuck it. We're on our own.

20:40.338 --> 20:42.540
Let's go, marines. Move move move.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.341
You'll be singled up.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.376
Just like chesty said.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.981
<i>Okay, marines, let's get these
supplies up the line.</i>

21:00.292 --> 21:02.693
How did chesty get all the phones?
God knows.

21:02.727 --> 21:04.395
He wants every gun-pit
on a party line

21:04.429 --> 21:06.731
So we got a man
listening at all times.

21:16.975 --> 21:18.675
<i>Hey, you want some limit stakes</i>

21:18.710 --> 21:20.210
<i>In there, sergeant?</i>

21:20.245 --> 21:23.046
Yeah, go get it.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.867
The japs are on the move.

21:49.901 --> 21:51.768
Hoosier and runner,
I want you to set up an lp.

21:51.803 --> 21:54.370
<i>- 30 yards inside the tree line.
- Aye aye, captain.</i>

21:54.404 --> 21:56.304
<i>I want your mg smack
up on the wire,</i>

21:56.339 --> 21:58.339
But preset placements
so you can move back.

21:58.373 --> 22:00.206
How thin are we on the line, sir?

22:00.241 --> 22:01.776
We're putting the
cooks on the line,

22:01.810 --> 22:03.815
But don't have enough cooks.

22:03.849 --> 22:06.585
Best case, we hear the shit going
off on the other side of the ridge.

22:06.619 --> 22:10.089
Why the other side? - The japs decided
to go around us to hit the airfield.

22:10.123 --> 22:12.491
We're too spread out,
same as puller and the 7th.

22:12.525 --> 22:15.427
Well, same old story
for the 1st marines.

22:15.461 --> 22:18.896
Two-hour watches tonight
all along the line.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.835
What you guys smokin'? Raleighs?

22:21.869 --> 22:24.171
That's our allotment.

22:24.206 --> 22:27.174
Only the officers get
the lucky strikes.

22:27.208 --> 22:30.477
Well, I can't have
my platoon suffering.

22:32.312 --> 22:35.548
Eyes open, ears up.

22:35.582 --> 22:37.283
Aye aye, sir.

22:37.317 --> 22:39.385
That was a gesture of a gentleman.

22:39.419 --> 22:42.588
<i>- Hoosier: We must really be fucked.
- Runner: Yep.</i>

22:50.763 --> 22:53.264
Thanks, evans.

22:57.869 --> 23:01.037
Here, sergeant,
while it's still dry.

23:01.938 --> 23:03.739
Thanks.

23:06.075 --> 23:08.643
A buddy of mine's up
there with the 5th,

23:09.911 --> 23:12.779
Played the trumpet with
me in the division band.

23:13.881 --> 23:17.183
You any good on the trumpet?

23:17.217 --> 23:21.253
Nah, mostly because
I play the trombone.

23:27.728 --> 23:29.829
That was a joke.

23:29.864 --> 23:31.798
Look at you.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.634
We'll make a marine out of you yet.

23:33.668 --> 23:35.836
<i>It's starting to come faster.</i>

23:35.870 --> 23:39.473
<i> </i>

23:39.508 --> 23:43.110
Sir, it's briggs at the outpost.

23:44.112 --> 23:45.345
Puller. Report, over.

23:45.379 --> 23:48.414
I got the whole fucking jap army

23:48.448 --> 23:50.849
Headed your way,ver.

23:54.052 --> 23:57.419
When they're past you,
pull out and hook up with able company.

23:57.453 --> 24:00.855
<i>1st battalion, hold your fire
as long as possible.</i>

24:00.890 --> 24:03.725
<i>Say again, hold your fire.</i>

24:03.759 --> 24:05.860
Over.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.330
We don't have enough men.

24:12.967 --> 24:15.535
<i>- Puller: Get division on the line.
- Man: Aye aye, sir.</i>

24:15.569 --> 24:16.969
- Rodriguez.
- Sir.

24:17.004 --> 24:19.939
Run as much ammo down there
as you can. - Aye aye, sir.

24:26.712 --> 24:28.912
They're not just coming
across the matanikau.

24:29.947 --> 24:31.614
They're coming right at us.

25:01.573 --> 25:03.840
<i>Squad leaders,
give me a head count!</i>

25:03.875 --> 25:07.243
<i>- Man #2: First squad's up.
- Man #3: Second squad's up.</i>

25:07.277 --> 25:09.945
- Everyone okay?
- Yes, sergeant.

25:13.215 --> 25:15.049
<i>Japs!</i>

25:16.885 --> 25:19.252
Japs left, crawling in!

25:27.559 --> 25:28.893
On your right!

25:31.966 --> 25:34.232
<i>- Reload.

25:58.933 --> 26:02.603
<i>- Man: Medic!

26:13.215 --> 26:17.319
<i>- Man: Cease fire!

26:19.989 --> 26:21.824
<i>Contact on the left.</i>

26:21.858 --> 26:23.459
<i>No shit.</i>

26:23.493 --> 26:26.128
that's jp for you.

26:26.163 --> 26:27.863
- How much ammo you got?
- Half a belt.

26:27.898 --> 26:29.565
- That's it?
- Yeah.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.534
This is our last box too, sergeant.

26:31.568 --> 26:34.704
fuck!

26:41.612 --> 26:43.180
Fuck!

26:50.255 --> 26:52.423
Read!

26:59.631 --> 27:01.466
Fuck, my gun's jammed!

27:04.803 --> 27:07.005
<i>Evans, mend the gun.</i>

27:11.878 --> 27:14.312
<i>Grenades out there!</i>

27:18.485 --> 27:19.886
You're up!

27:26.594 --> 27:28.695
Sergeant!

27:29.897 --> 27:31.965
Sergeant, they broke through!

27:31.999 --> 27:33.900
They overran us. Both guns are out.

27:33.934 --> 27:36.169
<i>Conserve your ammo.
We're running low.</i>

27:36.203 --> 27:37.704
Evans, we're going.

27:37.738 --> 27:40.473
We gotta help jp.

27:40.507 --> 27:42.876
Where the hell is my glove?

27:42.910 --> 27:47.047
- Lapointe, the tripod.
- Aye aye, sergeant.

27:48.550 --> 27:51.719
ahh.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.089
Cover cover!

27:54.124 --> 27:56.225
<i>To my right! To my right!</i>

27:56.260 --> 27:59.628
Get it on there.

27:59.663 --> 28:02.297
<i>Fill in that gap!</i>

29:11.927 --> 29:13.527
Let's go!

29:24.440 --> 29:27.541
<i>Ammo ammo!</i>

29:28.910 --> 29:30.777
Reload!

29:30.811 --> 29:33.146

29:43.589 --> 29:45.322

- At least 50.

29:45.357 --> 29:47.657
- Ahh!  Shit!
- You okay?

29:47.692 --> 29:49.659
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Here they come!

29:52.962 --> 29:54.596
Jesus christ.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.047
God damn!

30:47.438 --> 30:50.573
<i>I need a head and ammo count.</i>

30:50.607 --> 30:53.942
<i>Man #2: First squad: Two down,</i>

30:53.976 --> 30:55.677
<i>80 rounds remaining.</i>

30:55.711 --> 30:59.613
<i>Man #3: Third squad:
Three casualties.</i>

30:59.648 --> 31:03.149
Jp, cover me. - John, wait.
What are you doing?

31:03.184 --> 31:05.285
John, what are you doing?

31:19.598 --> 31:21.332
John, move, left flank.

31:21.366 --> 31:23.467
John, get outta there!

31:25.036 --> 31:26.303
Grenade!

31:31.409 --> 31:34.411
- What the hell was that?
- Now you've got a clear field of fire.

31:34.446 --> 31:36.847
- A clear field--
- lapointe, evans,

31:36.882 --> 31:39.183
Stay here, hold this position.

31:40.853 --> 31:43.654
- I'm gonna get more ammo.
- Morgan: Hurry back.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.931
Ammo for the 30s!

31:53.965 --> 31:55.566
Come on, come on, come on!

31:55.600 --> 31:57.535
That's all we got.

32:03.641 --> 32:06.644

32:21.394 --> 32:23.762
Ugh!

32:52.257 --> 32:56.026
<i>- Ammo!
- Man: I need cover!</i>

33:34.597 --> 33:36.431
Just keep it still.

33:36.466 --> 33:39.935
<i>Damn this. Goddamn bugs.</i>

34:10.828 --> 34:12.260
<i>Follow this barbed wire</i>

34:12.295 --> 34:14.229
<i>And find out where the bridge is.</i>

34:20.401 --> 34:22.403
Is he okay?

34:22.437 --> 34:24.938
Yeah, he's okay.

34:24.972 --> 34:27.070
He's sleeping.

34:28.970 --> 34:32.069
- Manny all right?
- Haven't seen him.

34:35.770 --> 34:38.102
Guess I need a new one, huh?

34:39.071 --> 34:40.669
You and me both.

34:51.973 --> 34:54.574
- Has he had any morphine?
- No.

34:54.609 --> 34:56.943
thanks.

34:58.144 --> 35:01.246
Hold him down.

35:06.447 --> 35:08.614
Hey, sergeant, hand me that pail.

35:14.483 --> 35:16.483
<i>Those are third-degree burns.</i>

35:16.518 --> 35:18.985
Have a seat over there and
we'll get to you when we can.

35:24.689 --> 35:27.455
Sir, anybody bring in
sergeant rodriguez last night?

35:27.489 --> 35:30.921
- Manny rodriguez?
- I wish I could keep track.

35:52.986 --> 35:55.086
Check the aid station?

36:03.792 --> 36:07.389
<i>Doesn't take long to get
ripe in this heat.</i>

36:07.424 --> 36:09.023
<i>Man #2: They're real damn stupid</i>

36:09.057 --> 36:10.957
<i>To keep running into a
machine gun like that.</i>

36:10.992 --> 36:14.392
<i>- Man #3: Morning, sir.
- Puller: As you were.</i>

36:20.328 --> 36:22.095
Nice work.

36:26.399 --> 36:29.901
I'm putting you in
for a medal, john.

36:29.935 --> 36:33.701
We're gonna be moving west
toward lunga, up on the ridge.

36:33.736 --> 36:35.835
164th's gonna take this position.

36:37.936 --> 36:41.069
- Get yourselves some hot chow.
- Aye aye, sir.

36:42.871 --> 36:47.973
Captain.

38:57.591 --> 38:59.692
It's gone, isn't it?

39:08.071 --> 39:10.473
Doesn't matter.

39:11.742 --> 39:14.544
I'm enlisting tomorrow.

39:14.578 --> 39:16.213
I'd do it tonight
if they were open.

39:16.247 --> 39:19.449
Eugene-- - I don't need
your permission, father.

39:22.320 --> 39:24.588
I haven't for some time.

39:39.217 --> 39:42.922
The worst thing about treating those
combat boys from the great war

39:42.956 --> 39:47.095
Wasn't that they had
had their flesh torn.

39:48.865 --> 39:52.467
It was that they had had
their souls torn out.

39:54.637 --> 39:57.538
<i>I don't want to look in
your eyes someday</i>

39:57.572 --> 40:02.610
<i>And see no spark, no love,
no... No life.</i>

40:03.846 --> 40:06.584
That would break my heart.

40:21.007 --> 40:23.942
Give me some time to break
the news to your mother.

40:25.546 --> 40:29.015
After supper I'll take
deacon for a walk.

40:29.050 --> 40:31.152
That would do it.

40:39.834 --> 40:42.036
Thank you, father.

40:45.908 --> 40:48.010
Come on, deacon.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.323
<i>Leckie's voice: "the foe you
gave was strong and brave</i>

41:02.358 --> 41:05.726
<i>And unafraid to die.</i>

41:05.761 --> 41:08.528
<i>Speak to the ld for our comrades,</i>

41:08.562 --> 41:11.897
<i>Killed when the battle
seemed lost.</i>

41:11.931 --> 41:14.899
<i>They went to meet a
bright defeat--</i>

41:14.933 --> 41:17.501
<i>The hero's holocaust.</i>

41:18.636 --> 41:21.271
<i>False is the vaunt of the victor,</i>

41:21.306 --> 41:24.374
<i>Empty our living pride.</i>

41:24.409 --> 41:27.378
<i>For those who fell there
is no hell--</i>

41:27.412 --> 41:29.647
<i>Not for the brave who died."</i>

41:29.681 --> 41:31.815
Say hi for me.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.817
- What?
- Vera.

41:33.852 --> 41:35.753
Tell her runner says howdy do.

41:39.993 --> 41:43.631
It's not a letter, it's a poem,

41:43.666 --> 41:46.202
- An ode.
- Hmm.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.310
An epitaglorious victory
in celebat guadalcanal..

41:51.344 --> 41:53.747
Must be tough to write that poem.

41:53.782 --> 41:56.188
I mean what the hell
rhymes with "guadalcanal"?

41:57.759 --> 42:00.298
How fucked are we
now on guadalcanal?

42:00.332 --> 42:04.139
<i>Get your gear and stand
by to stand by.</i>

42:06.378 --> 42:08.480
We're finally leaving
this shithole.

42:23.358 --> 42:25.525
<i>Clear the raft.</i>

42:27.127 --> 42:29.863
<i>Man #2: Squad leaders,
make sure all your marines</i>

42:29.898 --> 42:33.002
<i>Have all their gear and all
their equipment.</i>

42:33.036 --> 42:34.904
Jesus fucking christ, out with it.

42:34.938 --> 42:38.208
<i>First squad, pick uyour gear.</i>

42:38.243 --> 42:40.875
As fast as a bullet goes...

42:42.609 --> 42:44.711
It's just a split second.

42:47.549 --> 42:52.119
Manny steps to the left
instead of his right...

42:56.056 --> 43:00.159
I mean he was - he slowwhere he was and,
yeah, byou know...T.

43:01.327 --> 43:03.462
<i>He did what he did.</i>

43:10.203 --> 43:12.337
You don't ever think abt that?

43:13.873 --> 43:16.141
You know me, john.

43:16.175 --> 43:18.276
I try not to think.

43:22.915 --> 43:25.350
If it happens,  I.

43:33.659 --> 43:35.760
We should get moving.

43:38.163 --> 43:40.264
Yeah.

44:17.866 --> 44:20.500
No chow till 1400. I'm sorry.

44:21.635 --> 44:24.870
Hey, we heard there was coffee.

44:24.905 --> 44:27.106
Coffee?

44:27.140 --> 44:29.675
Shit, I can get you
guys some coffee.

44:29.709 --> 44:31.310
Milk and sugar?

44:49.226 --> 44:51.960
<i>So how bad was it?</i>

44:54.029 --> 44:56.598
'cause I heard it was bad.

45:12.982 --> 45:15.517
- From who?
- What do you mean?

45:15.551 --> 45:17.051
I mean before you got here,

45:17.086 --> 45:19.186
Had you ever even
heard of this place?

45:20.155 --> 45:21.922
Guadalcanal?

45:22.990 --> 45:24.624
Everybody's heard of guadalcanal

45:24.658 --> 45:26.225
In the 1st marine division.

45:26.259 --> 45:28.527
<i>You guys are on the front page</i>

45:28.561 --> 45:30.996
<i>Of every newspaper in america.</i>

45:34.900 --> 45:37.001
You're heroes back home.
