00:11.678 --> 00:14.431
[Ron] <i>After a wonderful adventure</i>
<i>with his son...</i>

00:14.514 --> 00:17.350
- [Buster] <i>Why did we come here?</i>
<i>- </i> [Ron] <i>...Oscar felt he could run no more.</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:19.436
- I have a confession.
- Oh.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.689
[Oscar] You're not a fugitive wanted
for killing Lucille 2.

00:22.772 --> 00:23.982
And you're not on the run.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.943
I was just telling you that
because I've just enjoyed being

00:27.027 --> 00:28.695
with you so much, and, um...

00:28.778 --> 00:29.821
Sorry.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.992
- I have a confession of my own to make.
- [Oscar] Huh?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.870
I also knew
we were not being looked for.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.831
I went along with it
because I... I... I wanted to spend

00:39.914 --> 00:41.666
some more time with you.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.172
All right.
All right, well, then go on inside

00:47.255 --> 00:50.717
and sign out,
and, uh, let's continue the adventure.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.260
Okay. [laughs] Okay, okay.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.595
- But while I'm gone...
- Yeah?

00:53.678 --> 00:56.556
Pick what you want to do when we get back.
Here's your choices:

00:56.639 --> 00:58.725
lay down inside,
get scared of the dark inside,

00:58.808 --> 01:00.518
or play hide-and-go-seek inside.

01:01.102 --> 01:04.688
This shouldn't take too long.
I hope you don't mind waiting for me.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.192
- Hey, I ain't going nowhere.
- [Buster] Okay.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.653
[clears throat] Oh, and one more thing.
I don't like the smell of marijuana

01:10.737 --> 01:13.782
or your behavior when I've caught you,
so it's me or the weed.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.243
[Buster chuckling]

01:19.579 --> 01:21.706
- Hello!
- [Oscar sighs]

01:24.209 --> 01:27.295
Outside, outside, outside, outside,
outside, outside, outside...

01:27.837 --> 01:29.547
[Ron] <i>Now, the story of a wealthy family</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:32.592
<i>who lost everything
and the one son who had no choice</i>

01:32.675 --> 01:34.469
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

01:34.552 --> 01:36.096
[theme music playing]

01:40.475 --> 01:42.185
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.149
[Ron] <i>George and Lucille</i>
<i>were finally having dinner</i>

01:48.233 --> 01:49.984
<i>with their wall investors,</i>

01:50.068 --> 01:52.654
<i>and they were waiting
for the right opportunity</i>

01:52.737 --> 01:55.323
<i>to lie about why they couldn't build it.</i>

01:55.824 --> 01:58.118
I'd just like to thank you
for joining us for dinner.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.078
[man] The least we can do
is pick up the check.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.330
You have burned so many phones
talking to us.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.414
[George Sr.] And to many,

02:03.498 --> 02:05.750
- many more burnings.
<i>- Ganbei.</i>

02:05.834 --> 02:07.502
<i>- Ganbei.</i>
- Oh, that voice.

02:08.252 --> 02:11.798
Well, shall we conclude the pleasantries
and move on to business?

02:12.757 --> 02:14.801
Okay, so as you probably heard,
our daughter,

02:14.884 --> 02:17.679
- Lindsay, lost the election.
- [Lucille] Ah, that's right,

02:17.762 --> 02:21.182
and her opponent Sally Sitwell
is very anti-wall.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.476
We pleaded with her
and asked her to support it,

02:23.560 --> 02:24.978
but she won't do it.

02:25.061 --> 02:27.272
- So, our hands are tied.
- [George Sr.] That's right.

02:27.355 --> 02:30.859
So, unfortunately, we... we, uh,
are unable to build the wall.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.152
So unfortunate.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.404
[traditional Chinese music playing]

02:34.654 --> 02:36.406
Okay. Done.

02:36.489 --> 02:37.949
Hey, is this music to you guys?

02:38.032 --> 02:40.243
I mean, do you really hear this as music?

02:40.326 --> 02:42.453
But Ms. Sitwell has publicly supported

02:42.537 --> 02:44.330
the construction of the wall.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.919
Technically, yes, but you see,
uh, on the flip side of that...

02:50.003 --> 02:52.547
We did not expect you to know that.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.342
We're upset.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.886
- [sighs]
- [Ron] <i>Caught in a lie,</i>

02:57.969 --> 02:59.637
<i>George Sr. had no choice...</i>

02:59.721 --> 03:01.681
Look, we invested your money.
That's the truth.

03:01.764 --> 03:02.974
[Ron] <i>...but to tell a lie</i>

03:03.057 --> 03:06.477
<i>- with the word "truth" in it.</i>
- And, uh, we can get it for you right now.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.856
I mean, just like that,
but, um, you know what?

03:09.939 --> 03:12.233
- We... We were thinking...
- Wouldn't they rather wait

03:12.317 --> 03:14.319
until the investment comes to fruition?

03:14.569 --> 03:16.696
We want the wall.
We'll pass on the fruition.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.949
Well, but, the banks are closed,
you know, tomorrow being the seventh.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.452
Take a little fruition.
We'll talk in a couple of days.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.370
- Oh, that's good.
- [man] No, we won't.

03:24.704 --> 03:25.997
You will hear from our people.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.374
Oh, please, please sit down.
Please, can we just sit down?

03:28.583 --> 03:31.711
All right? Wait, I cannot believe
I'm gonna do this, um...

03:32.837 --> 03:34.422
I want to tell you the truth,

03:34.505 --> 03:37.175
which is what my son insisted we do
from the start.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.260
The doctors give him three months to...

03:39.344 --> 03:42.513
- We spent all your money.
- What did you lie?

03:42.931 --> 03:45.141
We bought the land on the border
with your money.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.310
I mean, at least we thought we did,
and we were gonna

03:47.393 --> 03:49.229
sell it back to the United States
for a profit,

03:49.312 --> 03:50.647
and we weren't gonna tell you.

03:50.730 --> 03:54.067
But guess what? We... We bought... [laughs]

03:54.150 --> 03:55.860
We bought the wrong land.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.112
And then, the... the Romneys came.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.740
Uh, not the regular ones;
the Mexican Romneys.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.493
- We have Romneys.
- Mm-hmm.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.621
- Go on.
- Then we spent every last dime we had

04:06.704 --> 04:08.957
trying to get our idiot daughter elected.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.376
Who, by the way,
has completely disappeared.

04:11.459 --> 04:14.087
So even if she had won,
she couldn't have helped.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.673
And we've been lying to you for months.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.969
Honesty's good.

04:21.427 --> 04:25.056
And my wife is leaving me,
and I don't know what to do.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.601
And I think she's [bleep] a surfer,
and I can't get hard.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.478
That is more than enough honesty.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.981
- Oh, noodle stab. I mean...
- We had no idea

04:33.064 --> 04:35.692
how humiliating your circumstances were.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.986
It is very important for our partners,

04:38.069 --> 04:39.404
even in great failure,

04:39.612 --> 04:42.657
to remain honorable and save face.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.326
We'd like to offer you the opportunity

04:45.410 --> 04:47.120
to once again experience dignity

04:47.328 --> 04:49.914
by making a monetary gift to your family.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.626
[Ron] <i>And that's when the honesty</i>
<i>unexpectedly paid off.</i>

04:53.751 --> 04:56.587
Perhaps $3 million will suffice

04:56.671 --> 04:58.715
for removing some shame.

04:59.757 --> 05:03.219
Three million dollars. I mean,
that gets... Whew. That gets... [laughs]

05:03.303 --> 05:05.388
...gets rid of a lot of... lot of shame.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.348
I mean, there would still be shame.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.392
Yeah, I mean,
we had shame walking in the door,

05:09.475 --> 05:10.893
but, I mean, wow...

05:10.977 --> 05:12.937
Is there a bank account
we can wire the money to

05:13.021 --> 05:15.481
that would avoid unwanted attention
for you?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.191
[Ron] <i>The Bluths had such an account.</i>

05:17.275 --> 05:18.401
Oh, yeah, uh...

05:18.484 --> 05:19.902
That's... She's got that.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.113
[Ron] <i>And back at the office,</i>

05:22.196 --> 05:24.198
<i>Michael got off on his son's floor,</i>

05:24.615 --> 05:26.826
<i>- which he claimed was a...</i>
- Whoops! Force of habit.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.453
Hey, Fakeblock.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.580
[man] It's not the paycheck guy.
Don't worry about it.

05:30.663 --> 05:34.334
[Ron] <i>Only to discover</i>
<i>some very disgruntled Fakeblock employees.</i>

05:35.585 --> 05:36.586
Hey, Maeby.

05:36.669 --> 05:37.879
- Hey.
- [Michael] Hi, there.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.089
Hey, what's with the games?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.133
The new president seems to think
it's good for morale.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.885
[employee] We'd rather get paid.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.595
[Maeby]
The new president gave you checks.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.473
- You just can't, uh, cash 'em.
- You hired a president?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.933
Yeah, we had to, in order to put
the company on the market.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.935
But the guy I got is kind of an expert

05:53.019 --> 05:55.104
at creating the illusion of success.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.190
Please don't tell me
that you made Gob the president.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.691
[Gob] Did somebody wonder...

06:01.778 --> 06:04.238
if somebody else made Gob the president?

06:04.572 --> 06:06.699
- I wonder.
- [game chimes]

06:07.909 --> 06:09.494
Catchphrase could use some pruning.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.829
What are you doing?
I thought my son was president.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.831
No, he's chief technical officer.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.625
The president goes
with the company when we sell.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.669
I'm all for selling Gob,
but I thought I talked him out of that.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.338
Can I talk to George Michael? Is he here?

06:20.421 --> 06:21.589
[Maeby] George Michael?

06:22.632 --> 06:23.758
Who's that?

06:25.009 --> 06:26.803
He's a singer, I think. [chuckles]

06:27.136 --> 06:29.055
Like, a gay one. And, you know,

06:29.138 --> 06:30.765
you can't convert that away,
but yeah,

06:30.848 --> 06:33.601
I think that guy is a singer.
Do we have Internet?

06:33.684 --> 06:35.019
Uh, sorry, George Maharis.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.312
No, I'm not George Maharis.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.357
George Michael is George Maharis,
and he's in your old office.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.775
- Oh. Thank you.
- [Gob] Don't know.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.652
Once you're gay, you're gay, Michael!

06:42.735 --> 06:46.447
[laughs] God, Michael's so stupid.
Everybody's gonna see.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.866
- [knock on door]
- [Michael] Hi. Hey.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.827
I'm sure you're busy.
I said I'd never do this.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.370
- No, it's just...
- Am I interrupting?

06:52.453 --> 06:54.872
Uh, sorry. It's...
You know how deadlines are

06:54.956 --> 06:58.418
- with this stuff. It's tight.
- Sure. You're selling the company?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.628
I thought the free office space
would help.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.547
No, it's just, we have so many expenses

07:02.630 --> 07:04.507
that I don't know
how I'm gonna pay the staff.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.634
- [Michael] Mm-hmm.
- I've gone through this three times.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.678
I'm just... [grunts] I gotta get smart.

07:08.761 --> 07:12.140
- Well, hey, can't you get an intern?
- No, I keep getting Catwoman.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.975
- What's that?
- It's the thread-count question.

07:14.058 --> 07:15.935
It's gotta be the thread-count question.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.396
Well, you lost me there.
Hey, you can't give up.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.064
'Cause we just talked about this.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.316
Bluth boys, we never give up.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.527
And I hope that this isn't about Rebel.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.696
I think it is a big mistake
to take her money.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.156
She's your girlfriend,
not a business partner.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.032
No, I agree. I'm not...
I'm not gonna do that.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.035
Definitely not. Because I'm a long way
from making this thing work.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.787
I can't afford to keep this thing running

07:34.871 --> 07:36.873
for another year,
and that's how long it could take.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.584
I'll lose the employees,
and then I'll never get a buyer.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.502
I just don't think I can save it.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.546
Oh, boy. Listen,
I'm sure I'm not one to talk.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.381
I finally got Mom and Dad to admit

07:45.465 --> 07:48.759
they've screwed the company
with that ridiculous wall project.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.053
But it's over. Some things are just...

07:51.304 --> 07:52.930
they're... they're beyond saving.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.057
Even if I did,
they wouldn't be able to admit it.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.144
I mean,
they just do not appreciate what I do.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.605
I just think it's too bad that...

08:00.688 --> 08:03.649
I'm not gonna be able to run
the family business with my son.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.277
We could've brought this thing
into the 21st century.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.862
It would've been fun.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.572
It sure would've been fun. Hey.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.492
I got you an office-warming gift.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.160
I guess now it's an office-closing gift,

08:14.243 --> 08:15.912
but take a look at this.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.748
Your first paycheck
at the banana stand. Look at that.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.291
Oh, I just wanted to frame up

08:20.374 --> 08:22.543
the... the first one
as a reminder of the value

08:22.627 --> 08:24.545
of a... an honest day's work.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.714
It's funny, I don't remember getting

08:26.797 --> 08:28.508
- a paycheck from...
- You didn't.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.177
No, I couldn't give this to you
because you were underage.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.304
In fact, I couldn't pay you,
period, as an employee

08:33.385 --> 08:34.972
without getting in trouble
with the government.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.015
I think we had you coded as a topping.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.433
No, in fact, where is it?
There it is, right there.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.313
"Payment of two drums
of dried George Michael."

08:42.438 --> 08:45.066
- "A cocoa-based, non-digestive..."
- "Colorant."

08:45.149 --> 08:46.817
- I used to love those.
- [Michael] Yeah.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.070
- I still do, kiddo.
- [chuckles softly]

08:50.571 --> 08:53.658
Well, maybe we're gonna end up together
in the banana stand someday.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.369
Mm. Well, there's always money
in the banana stand.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.246
- Right.
- Where is that from?

08:58.329 --> 09:00.122
- Is that from something?
- It's the only part of the business

09:00.206 --> 09:02.542
- that always turned a profit.
- Right. Well, I know it did.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.003
Although, I just...
I went through the books recently,

09:06.087 --> 09:08.631
and I did not see any income
from the banana stand.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.926
- Wouldn't have been much.
- Right, but it would've been something.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.720
They would've had to have kept it.
Let me see that check again.

09:17.848 --> 09:20.685
- That is not our banana logo, is it?
- [George Michael] No.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.229
- Guess that's the bank's logo?
- No.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.231
That's an island.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.942
This is a check from the Cayman Islands.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.361
[Ron] <i>It appeared there was</i>
<i>at least one account</i>

09:30.444 --> 09:33.489
<i>- Michael hadn't been privy to.</i>
- [George Michael] I'll tell you what,

09:33.573 --> 09:35.825
it feels good to finally hold this check
in my hands.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.412
- Just symbolically, after...
- George Michael, that check...

09:40.079 --> 09:41.289
- Rip it up?
- [Michael] No.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.291
But, uh, give it to me.
It's not even for you.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.417
It's for toppings.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.129
[Ron] <i>George and Lucille, meanwhile,</i>

09:48.212 --> 09:50.506
<i>were celebrating their success
with the Chinese.</i>

09:50.590 --> 09:51.632
You were brilliant.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.010
Wow. Three million dollars.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.721
When Michael says honesty pays,
he was right.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.097
Three million!

09:58.180 --> 09:59.890
Oh, hey. How'd it go?

10:00.182 --> 10:02.143
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I asked him to come.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.520
Dusty's an expert on Orient... Uh...

10:05.855 --> 10:08.899
<i>- Asian </i> inscrutability.
- Very good.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.235
- So it went good?
- [both] Oh.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.738
Excellent.
We told them we lost all their money,

10:13.821 --> 10:16.032
and they gave us $3 million.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.285
[George Sr.] So, uh,
what's the proper Asian response to that?

10:19.368 --> 10:21.579
- You can't keep it.
- What?

10:21.662 --> 10:22.913
You're supposed to give it back.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.749
That way, you can save face.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.751
I lost this face when I was 65.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.753
I'm keeping the money.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.338
They didn't give it to you as a gift.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.341
They gave it to you as a chance
to regain your pride.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.177
If you keep the money,
they'll be mildly displeased

10:36.260 --> 10:38.888
and probably seek
a merciless revenge.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.183
But if you give it back to them,
see, that's it, you're out.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.060
Hard to hear, I know.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.312
But there's freedom for you
in the exchange.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.898
[Ron] <i>Dusty had more wisdom</i>
<i>than it appeared.</i>

10:49.690 --> 10:51.567
- You said we'd get ice cream.
- [Lucille gasps]

10:51.901 --> 10:53.903
I have to get Dusty ice cream.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.572
- Um...
- [door opens]

10:58.616 --> 10:59.700
[door closes]

11:01.410 --> 11:04.955
[Ron] <i>Meanwhile, Maeby was growing tired</i>
<i>of her living conditions.</i>

11:05.039 --> 11:08.334
- [Maeby] Stan, turn down Wayne Brady!
- I surely couldn't. [laughs]

11:08.417 --> 11:11.462
[troupe laughs]

11:13.756 --> 11:15.633
Anyway, none of it was our fault.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.845
For whatever reason,
our dreams have not panned out.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.555
[DeBrie] I just wanted to get out

11:21.639 --> 11:23.140
of doing things like <i>Straightbait.</i>

11:23.224 --> 11:25.434
I just couldn't do
another group [bleep] scene,

11:25.518 --> 11:27.520
but I love staying at Tent City.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.106
Yes, but that turned out to be
a travel and adventure store.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.234
And we were squatting right in the middle
of their summer two-for-one.

11:33.317 --> 11:36.362
But that's when we met Buster,
who told us where you were.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.656
Guys, this is not an option.

11:38.739 --> 11:40.491
These two aren't even our real family.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.411
Besides, Stan's already getting suspicious
of me as an old lady.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.162
He's certainly not gonna buy it from you.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.832
And I'm not gonna last much longer
if I can't get rid of this guy.

11:47.915 --> 11:49.834
[Murph] Oh, like... like a boyfriend?

11:49.917 --> 11:52.586
'Cause you're rather quite attractive
for an older lady.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.089
[Tobias] That is your half-sister.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.842
Okay, the party.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.386
'Cause I was gonna say,
does she have, like, a half-daughter?

12:00.469 --> 12:02.263
- Oh, that's not...
- What is this?

12:02.346 --> 12:03.597
Voices up. [laughs]

12:03.889 --> 12:05.558
[in high-pitched voice] <i>Enchanté.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:08.185
Are these people your family?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.062
Is that why you wanted me to go?

12:13.065 --> 12:15.609
[Ron] <i>And caught with nowhere to hide,</i>

12:15.860 --> 12:17.653
<i>she decided to tell the truth.</i>

12:17.737 --> 12:20.030
Yes. They are.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.035
I shall pack my things.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.040
[Maeby] Well, that was a freebie.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.752
Now I just gotta figure out
how to get rid of you guys.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.129
[troupe laughs]

12:37.131 --> 12:37.965
Group hug.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.176
- Group hug.
- No. I don't want to...

12:40.259 --> 12:43.095
Hug. Hug. Hug, DeBrie. Group <i>hug.</i>

12:43.179 --> 12:44.638
[troupe giggles]

12:44.722 --> 12:48.017
[Ron] <i>And while Maeby had finally accepted</i>
<i>her family,</i>

12:48.100 --> 12:50.936
<i>Michael was ready to investigate his.</i>

12:54.231 --> 12:56.817
[Michael] Where are you,
banana stand money?

12:58.000 --> 13:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:07.119 --> 13:09.371
"There's always money
in the banana stand."

13:11.999 --> 13:13.793
That's gotta be from <i>South Park.</i>

13:14.960 --> 13:18.255
[Ron] <i>Back at the office,</i>
<i>the employees were growing restless.</i>

13:18.339 --> 13:20.132
Which one is getting suspicious?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.009
Yeah, I think all of them.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.887
They keep throwing
these tough tech questions at me, like,

13:24.970 --> 13:26.806
"What should we be working on?"
Stuff like that.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.808
I hate "What should we be working on?"

13:29.099 --> 13:30.643
'Cause then you're tempted to be like,

13:30.976 --> 13:32.686
"Know what?
We need you to invent Fakeblock."

13:32.770 --> 13:33.813
The minute you say that...

13:33.896 --> 13:35.439
Then they know there's no Fakeblock.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.733
Yeah. I mean, isn't this why
we hired a president?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.860
Exactly to not answer these questions.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.863
[George Michael] He said
he's putting together some surprise.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.615
You know what these people need?

13:44.698 --> 13:47.451
A little leadership
and a little inspiration.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.662
So go give it to 'em. There you go.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.705
- Wait, me? Well, I don't...
- [Maeby] Get out there.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.876
Hey, guys.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.714
- Yo.
- [man] Hey.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.260
All right, question:

14:04.343 --> 14:08.013
How many of you wake up
with a knot in your stomach?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.061
Right. Me, too.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.606
But I like to think of that knot
in my stomach

14:18.357 --> 14:21.026
as a little ball of energy.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.614
You know, it keeps me frightened

14:25.698 --> 14:27.157
when I should be calm.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.120
It pumps adrenaline through my veins

14:31.203 --> 14:34.999
when ordinary blood is what I need.

14:36.083 --> 14:40.379
But, you know, all of these things
can create a winning spirit.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.300
One that I would like
for all of you to share in.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.928
So that we can turn those knots
in our stomach

14:48.012 --> 14:50.139
into why-nots.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.933
- [employees murmur in approval]
- You know?

14:53.934 --> 14:55.519
People say there... there's no such thing

14:56.061 --> 14:58.105
as privacy on the Internet.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.982
- Well, why not?
- Why not?

15:00.065 --> 15:01.483
- [man 2] Yeah.
- Right.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.235
People say no one can build

15:03.319 --> 15:05.446
a completely impenetrable wall.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.240
- Why not?
- [employees] Why not?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.451
And, you know, people say
you shouldn't start a company

15:10.534 --> 15:12.745
without cracking the technology

15:13.329 --> 15:16.707
that supports the flagship product
of the company.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.626
For obvious reasons.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.961
- Well, why not?
- [employees] Why not?

15:21.378 --> 15:23.589
And what if you find out
you're never gonna get paid,

15:23.672 --> 15:25.174
there is no product, and you're like,

15:25.257 --> 15:26.967
"Well, we can't let him get away
with this."

15:27.051 --> 15:29.887
- Well, why not?
- [employees murmuring]

15:29.970 --> 15:31.805
[Ron] <i>That may have been a step too far.</i>

15:31.889 --> 15:32.848
<i>But it wouldn't matter,</i>

15:32.932 --> 15:35.351
<i>because Maeby had just gotten
some good news.</i>

15:35.434 --> 15:36.685
Sorry, um, we... we did it.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.938
- What?
- We just sold Fakeblock.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.648
- What?
- Yeah.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.984
- We sold it? Uh, how much?
- Yeah.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.111
Three million dollars.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.947
- Three million dollars?
- [Maeby] Yeah.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.115
That's way more
than Rebel was ever offering.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.575
There's no way
she can be mad at me.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.202
Who cares if she's mad
at you or not?

15:53.285 --> 15:56.664
- We did it. We are geniuses.
- [George Michael] I can stop lying to Dad.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.415
I mean, I feel bad for the new owner.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.793
It's bogus software. I mean,
what if it bankrupts them?

16:00.876 --> 16:01.710
Oh, click.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.212
How sorry can you feel for some guy

16:03.295 --> 16:07.716
who's obviously incredibly rich
and has $3 million to drop

16:07.800 --> 16:10.135
on a .wav file
that's just the sound of a piece of wood.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.013
[George Michael, laughing]
You know...

16:13.305 --> 16:14.765
We had those checks issued to you,

16:14.848 --> 16:17.351
and you're thinking,
"We want to cash those checks."

16:17.434 --> 16:19.687
- Well, why not?
- [employees] Why not?

16:19.770 --> 16:20.980
Why the hell not?

16:21.063 --> 16:23.691
- [laughs] Yeah.
- Keep doing what you're doing.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.067
- Cash those checks.
- [employees whoop]

16:25.150 --> 16:27.027
- [George Michael] We've got jobs.
- [Ron] <i>While they were</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:28.779
<i>- getting out of the business...</i>
- [Maeby] Except us.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.198
- Yeah, we're out of here.
<i>- ...directly upstairs,</i>

16:31.281 --> 16:33.951
<i>George and Lucille were finally
back in it.</i>

16:34.034 --> 16:36.078
- Hello, hello.
- [gasps] There he is,

16:36.161 --> 16:37.871
the man of the hour!

16:39.039 --> 16:39.873
You all right, Mom?

16:40.082 --> 16:41.667
I'm just happy to see you.

16:41.875 --> 16:42.918
That's what's off.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.462
How was that meeting
with the Chinese investors?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.840
It was fantastic. I mean,

16:47.923 --> 16:49.967
that advice you gave us,
the honesty thing,

16:50.050 --> 16:51.927
it was... it was great. Thank you.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.389
The truth came out of my mouth
as easy as any lie I could've thought of.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.141
[George Sr.] She was so believable.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.851
I thought she <i>was </i> lying.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.311
[Lucille] It was
like the opposite of Pinocchio.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.814
I swear, I think my nose got smaller.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.522
Well, wouldn't have been the first time.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.358
[George Sr.] Anyway, it worked.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.069
The wall is off,
and we are out of that contract.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.530
Everything is good.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.531
- And we can start over.
- That's so great.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.534
That's so great. That's just...
It's perfect.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.202
You... You know, you guys

17:17.286 --> 17:19.872
finally discovered the value
of telling the truth.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.874
I just... I wish that you had learned that

17:21.957 --> 17:23.625
before you lied to me.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.544
Can you be more specific with that?

17:25.627 --> 17:28.172
- There's been a number of lies.
- [Michael] Sure.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.215
When you told me
that this company was bankrupt.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.634
- But we <i>are </i> bankrupt, Michael.
- [George Sr.] Flat broke.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.430
But the family business is still alive,
and the Bluths are back.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.016
- We are bigger and better than ever.
- [Michael] Okay.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.394
I dug a little bit deeper,
and I found some extra capital.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.604
Really? That's fantastic.

17:43.687 --> 17:44.563
- But how much?
- Yeah.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.315
Hey, um... Oh, everybody's here.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.192
- Hi.
- I was hoping to talk to you for a minute.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.319
I have something
I want to discuss with you, too.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.279
I was just gonna call down,
have you come up.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.906
Mine is private. It's business-related.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.909
Well, this is a business conference room.
Why don't you share it here?

17:56.992 --> 17:59.036
- [sighs]
- You might as well just tell him.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.665
- I sold Fakeblock.
- [Ron] <i>And as George Michael</i>

18:03.749 --> 18:06.418
<i>prepared himself
for his father's disappointment...</i>

18:06.502 --> 18:07.628
You what?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.172
That's so great!

18:10.255 --> 18:13.133
- You're not disappointed?
- Disappointed?

18:13.217 --> 18:16.053
No, I'm not disappointed.
Boy, George Michael.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.306
- And we got three mil for it.
- Come on.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.767
You sold your first business,
and you got three million?

18:21.850 --> 18:25.729
[shrieks] Three mil?
That is such great news!

18:25.813 --> 18:29.441
Mr. Big Business,
sold your company. How do you feel?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.902
To be honest,
I feel incredibly relieved.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.738
I'm glad I stuck it out
and didn't declare bankruptcy.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.365
It's been a tremendous pressure on us.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.326
We had to pay off the employees,
and the bank took the rest of it,

18:39.409 --> 18:42.579
- but I'm glad I'm back at zero.
- [George Sr.] We're both at zero.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.456
- It's great.
- Did this by himself.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.333
All that burden on your shoulders.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.710
No one to help you. A little baby Atlas.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.463
- Oh, is that how you see me?
- Hmm? Oh, doesn't matter.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.882
Hey, I got an announcement
to make myself, okay?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.300
Since I found some extra money,

18:55.384 --> 18:57.970
I decided to expand.
And what is the company motto?

18:58.053 --> 19:00.055
Find a little extra money,
put it in a Bluth.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.475
<i>I </i> bought Fakeblock.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.727
What?

19:06.311 --> 19:07.312
[Maeby] No, um...

19:07.688 --> 19:10.607
No, this company, uh, B.S. Enterprises,
bought Fakeblock.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.777
I'm B.S. Enterprises.
It... It was "Banana Stand,"

19:13.861 --> 19:15.362
but it's also got a second meaning.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.114
- Bullshit.
- Bluth and Son.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.910
I bought you! I had to use a shell company
because I knew

19:21.994 --> 19:23.287
you were gonna give me
a discount,

19:23.370 --> 19:24.580
and I wasn't gonna have that.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.124
You bought Fakeblock? This is...

19:27.207 --> 19:29.376
This is a dream come true, is it not?

19:29.459 --> 19:30.878
That's how I felt when I found

19:30.961 --> 19:32.671
the money for it in a hidden account.

19:33.088 --> 19:35.465
Well, that certainly explains
the complete lack of vetting

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
- of our software.
- [Michael] Mm-hmm, sure. Listen,

19:37.801 --> 19:39.928
I'm not gonna get involved
in any of that tech stuff,

19:40.012 --> 19:41.805
even though I did spend
that couple of months

19:41.889 --> 19:44.183
at the Search campus.
But I'm not gonna start coding,

19:44.266 --> 19:47.102
'cause if Fakeblock doesn't work,
we lose both companies for good.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.061
You understand?

19:48.145 --> 19:50.898
- [George Michael] I thought it was over.
- You thought it was over.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.649
Look how emotional he is, huh?

19:52.733 --> 19:56.028
Listen, that's why I stepped in.
Fakeblock ain't going nowhere.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.907
[Ron] <i>But while Michael enjoyed</i>
<i>that the news made his son so happy,</i>

19:59.990 --> 20:02.701
<i>he was even more eager
to see it do the opposite</i>

20:02.784 --> 20:05.370
<i>- to his parents.</i>
- Where'd you find that three million?

20:05.662 --> 20:07.956
In your banana stand slush fund.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.875
I mean, I... I know that you have been

20:09.958 --> 20:13.545
ripping us off with money
for years, but $3 million?

20:13.629 --> 20:15.505
- Shh.
- That's not our money, Michael.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.007
Listen to me.
That money was given

20:17.090 --> 20:20.219
to us by the Chinese
so we could give it back to them.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.887
It was face-saving money.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.139
And now you've spent it,
and on what?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.308
My son's future.
And that money's gonna now save

20:26.391 --> 20:28.769
the company, because it's invested
in something valuable.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.355
[George Sr.] We were out.
You understand?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.482
We were out. No wall. No wall.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.859
But if the Chinese see
we're buying companies,

20:35.943 --> 20:37.277
they're going to want it now.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.529
And we are screwed.
Do you understand that?

20:39.863 --> 20:42.950
You, me,
and especially George Michael.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.993
- Unless you get the money back from him.
- No, no.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.120
No, no. George Michael's
got nothing to do with this.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.747
You better tell that to the Chinese,

20:48.830 --> 20:51.875
because they will trace the $3 million
to him,

20:51.959 --> 20:54.378
and they will be mildly displeased.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.837
You have to get that money back.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.215
They're going to be mildly displeased.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.758
Mildly displeased.

20:59.841 --> 21:02.636
It's too late. You heard him.
He paid off his debts.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.554
You just can't say I made a good decision.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.556
Dad, I'm mildly displeased
about something.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.892
This. This is what I spent your money on.
Look at him.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.436
George Michael,
tell them how great your company is

21:11.520 --> 21:16.108
and that the son they can't compliment
is about to make them rich.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.402
Tell them that I made the right choice.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.243
[sighs] You made the right choice.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.870
Fakeblock is real.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.999
It's a... It's a very weird way

21:32.082 --> 21:36.003
to say it, but, you know,
Fakeblock, it's real.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.838
This is the...
This is the best investment

21:37.921 --> 21:39.965
this family has made in years.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.174
I feel sick.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.426
I've felt better.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.429
Wait till you find out
who the new president is.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.848
- Oh, no.
- Did somebody say,

21:48.390 --> 21:51.393
"Wait until you find out
who the president is"?

21:51.476 --> 21:54.688
Yes, but then we figured it out,
and your father said, "Oh, no."

21:54.771 --> 21:56.398
[George Sr.] So we've got $3 million

21:56.481 --> 21:58.984
tied up in something Gob's in charge of?

21:59.067 --> 22:01.945
[Maeby] Maybe we could just hire him,
like, a really good assistant.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.488
One step ahead of you.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.241
I took this guy home with me
last night after I found him

22:06.325 --> 22:08.160
next to the police station.

22:08.243 --> 22:11.288
Please say hello
to my new right-hand man!

22:15.334 --> 22:17.461
- Now, geo-bead.
- Did somebody say,

22:17.544 --> 22:19.629
"I took this guy home with me
after I found him

22:19.713 --> 22:22.758
next to the police station. Say hello..."

22:23.884 --> 22:26.428
[Gob] Well, that would've been better
if it was his right hand,

22:26.511 --> 22:31.308
but, uh... but I figured, if somebody's
willing to spend 3KK on my company,

22:31.933 --> 22:35.979
- might be able to spread wealth on myself.
- Did my hand get off on this floor?

22:36.063 --> 22:38.523
Well, look who finally decided to show up.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.109
Steve McQueen from <i>The Great Escape.</i>

22:41.610 --> 22:44.237
I take it you saw the unwanted posters?

22:44.321 --> 22:46.114
[Buster] Yes, and I got the hint.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.367
- No one was chasing after me.
- [Lucille gasps]

22:48.450 --> 22:50.744
Oh, right. It had two meanings.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.245
Well, I'm sorry.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.998
But if you hadn't insisted
on being in that stupid parade,

22:55.082 --> 22:56.625
none of this would've happened.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.378
Yes, well,
that parade created a great deal of...

22:59.961 --> 23:01.880
pain for a lot of us.

23:02.422 --> 23:05.550
♪ <i>Who's gonna tell you when...</i> ♪

23:05.842 --> 23:07.719
But, anyway, we're here to celebrate.

23:08.136 --> 23:10.180
I'm sure somebody did something
to make this a party

23:10.263 --> 23:11.640
- for the president.
- [elevator dings]

23:11.932 --> 23:12.766
Bluth?

23:12.849 --> 23:14.601
[George Sr.] Wait a minute.
What's going on?

23:14.684 --> 23:15.936
Oh, Wait, what's going...

23:16.019 --> 23:17.938
Who did this?
Is this because I'm still gay?

23:18.021 --> 23:21.024
Hot Cops? On such short notice?
Who did this?

23:21.108 --> 23:23.610
- 'Cause the conversion didn't take?
- Buster Bluth?

23:23.693 --> 23:25.487
Yes! Who did this?

23:25.570 --> 23:27.656
- Who did this?
- You're under arrest.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.116

[Ron] <i>But the real cops</i>

23:35.580 --> 23:39.042

Well, now I've seen it all.

23:45.549 --> 23:48.009
<i>- But Gob knew none of this.</i>
- [Gob] <i>Oh, I wish I had</i>

23:48.093 --> 23:51.179
- my boom box! I just... Ah, here it goes!

23:52.764 --> 23:54.141
[officer] You have the right

Anything you say or do

You have the right

an attorney, one will be provided for you.
