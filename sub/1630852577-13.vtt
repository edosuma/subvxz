00:06.103 --> 00:07.586
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:07.655 --> 00:10.620
You'll be starring
in Moulin Ru.

00:18.413 --> 00:20.482
Jorgeous.

00:20.551 --> 00:23.206
There was a disconnect
from what your body was doing

00:23.275 --> 00:25.241
and what was on your face.

00:25.310 --> 00:27.000
Bosco.

00:27.068 --> 00:29.310
You could have gone
so much further with it.

00:29.379 --> 00:31.103
Lady Camden.

00:31.172 --> 00:33.482
I totally knew who you were.

00:33.551 --> 00:36.068
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:37.586 --> 00:40.034
Jorgeous, shantay you stay.

00:41.310 --> 00:44.241
Bosco. If you have
the gold bar,

00:44.310 --> 00:46.482
you will be safe.

00:53.448 --> 00:55.172
Oh, my goodness!

00:58.241 --> 01:02.931
Bosco, you are safe
to slay another day!

01:10.172 --> 01:12.310
Mm.

01:14.827 --> 01:17.413
Oh, there's
no lipstick message.

01:17.482 --> 01:18.551
I've just been saved

01:18.620 --> 01:22.068
by the most
splendiferous candy bar

01:22.137 --> 01:24.068
in existence.

01:24.137 --> 01:26.172
I feel so crazy,

01:26.241 --> 01:29.172
but I feel like
I'm supposed to be here.

01:29.241 --> 01:31.620
I am supposed to be
on this couch.

01:31.689 --> 01:34.586
I got the golden chocolate bar.

01:37.103 --> 01:38.034
Come on, chocolate.

01:38.103 --> 01:40.000
Holy fuck.

01:41.517 --> 01:43.689
Yay, Bosco.

01:43.758 --> 01:45.896
It sucks for the rest of us,

01:45.965 --> 01:47.517
because now immunity
is out the door.

01:47.586 --> 01:50.172
I feel like Charlie
andthe Chocolate Factory

01:50.241 --> 01:51.517
all in one.

01:51.586 --> 01:53.482
Like, what?

01:53.551 --> 01:57.103
I was kind of unhappy
when Bosco gets immunity,

01:57.172 --> 01:58.413
because what else
is it gonna take

01:58.482 --> 02:00.482
to get these bitches
out of here, you know?

02:00.551 --> 02:02.724
And it's, like,
getting frustrating.

02:02.793 --> 02:04.620
This is a lot.

02:04.689 --> 02:05.862
It's a lot.

02:05.931 --> 02:07.172
Bosco, how did you feel

02:07.241 --> 02:09.241
about all of us
saying your name?

02:09.310 --> 02:11.655
Who should go home tonight?

02:11.724 --> 02:13.172
I would have to say Bosco.

02:13.241 --> 02:14.310
-Bosco.
-Bosco.

02:14.379 --> 02:16.034
-Bosco.
-I would have to say Bosco.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.000
I would have to say Bosco.

02:18.068 --> 02:19.448
But if you wanna
talk about track record,

02:19.517 --> 02:22.172
she was in the bottom
three times in one episode.

02:23.793 --> 02:27.103
Was it a surprise
that everybody said my name?

02:27.172 --> 02:29.551
After hearing what
the judges had to say,

02:29.620 --> 02:30.517
I'm not delusional.

02:30.586 --> 02:31.758
I'm not out of touch

02:31.827 --> 02:33.448
with, like, what
had happened on the stage.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.000
The lady asked you
to say a name,

02:35.068 --> 02:36.586
so you have to say a name.

02:36.655 --> 02:39.620
Literally every person
in this building

02:39.689 --> 02:42.482
told me to go home,
and I didn't,

02:42.551 --> 02:44.206
and that's really funny.

02:44.275 --> 02:47.379
I do wanna say congrats, baby.

02:47.448 --> 02:48.448
Thank you.

02:48.517 --> 02:50.172
I know, like,
we had a moment,

02:50.241 --> 02:52.689
and, like, I am fully willing
to take responsibility

02:52.758 --> 02:54.517
for a lot of that moment.

02:54.586 --> 02:56.241
It was both of us, though,
you know what I mean?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.655
Like, we both should share
the weight of that argument.

02:59.724 --> 03:00.793
I was being a brat as well.

03:00.862 --> 03:04.655
I am nothing
but very, very happy

03:04.724 --> 03:05.758
and pleased for you.

03:05.827 --> 03:07.034
I'm sure at this point,

03:07.103 --> 03:09.689
Bosco is gunning
for some redemption

03:09.758 --> 03:11.862
as she was almost sent home,

03:11.931 --> 03:13.689
but we all are right now.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.448
It doesn't matter
if you just won

03:15.517 --> 03:16.758
or you almost went home.

03:16.827 --> 03:19.413
We are so close to the finale.

03:19.482 --> 03:20.551
Smell the chocolate.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.517
Smells like victory.

03:23.586 --> 03:26.172
There's so many distractions

03:26.241 --> 03:28.655
as we get closer
and closer to the crown.

03:28.724 --> 03:31.275
You have to focus
on that crown.

03:33.172 --> 03:36.241
And the journey continues.

03:36.310 --> 03:37.413
Continues.

03:41.034 --> 03:42.413
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

03:42.482 --> 03:44.068
receives a one-year supply

03:44.137 --> 03:46.413
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

03:46.482 --> 03:51.862
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

03:51.931 --> 03:54.689
With extra-special guest judge,
Dulcé Sloan.

04:03.586 --> 04:05.137
-It's a new day!
-Helloteous.

04:05.206 --> 04:09.241
It is another day
in the werkroom.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.137
Even though there's
seven girls here right now,

04:11.206 --> 04:13.724
we are so close to the finale.

04:13.793 --> 04:16.000
It's like
I'm edging right now.

04:17.551 --> 04:19.413
Can you say that?
I don't know.

04:19.482 --> 04:21.379
Jorgie, Jorgie-porgie.

04:21.448 --> 04:24.758
I think it's safe to say
that you definitely are

04:24.827 --> 04:27.137
the lip sync assassin
of the season.

04:27.206 --> 04:28.241
Yeah.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.413
How do you feel
about that, DeJa?

04:29.482 --> 04:31.551
Well, it wasn't
an official title,

04:31.620 --> 04:32.724
so I don't really
give a fuck.

04:32.793 --> 04:34.620
Because RuPaul said
I am, darling.

04:34.689 --> 04:37.931
Apparently there is
a lip sync assassin among us.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.344
No, no, no, no, no.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.965
She said you could be.

04:43.034 --> 04:44.482
All right.

04:46.034 --> 04:48.034
Your application
is pending, DeJa.

04:50.172 --> 04:51.551
Hello, hello, hello.

04:53.586 --> 04:54.931
Ladies, we've got company.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.965
Please give a warm
Drag Racewelcome

04:59.034 --> 05:01.793
to the president
of Anastasia Beverly Hills,

05:01.862 --> 05:02.793
Norvina.

05:06.551 --> 05:08.448
Yes, girl.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.896
Ladykins, thanks to Norvina,

05:11.965 --> 05:13.448
this is your lucky day.

05:13.517 --> 05:16.551
For the first time
in Drag Raceherstory,

05:16.620 --> 05:18.551
I'm giving you the chance

05:18.620 --> 05:20.758
to paint my face.

05:22.172 --> 05:23.896
What?

05:23.965 --> 05:24.896
Girl, what?

05:24.965 --> 05:26.655
There's no way in hell, bitch,

05:26.724 --> 05:28.689
that RuPaul is gonna
let us paint her face.

05:28.758 --> 05:29.724
Girl, are you serious?

05:29.793 --> 05:32.172
Norvina, my dear, after you.

05:32.241 --> 05:36.413
Now, queens, walk this way.

05:36.482 --> 05:38.344
No, really.
Walk this way.

05:42.862 --> 05:46.000
Ladies, uncover your eyes.

05:46.068 --> 05:49.517
One, two, three.

05:49.586 --> 05:51.413
Oh, my God!

05:51.482 --> 05:53.655
So for today's mini-challenge,

05:53.724 --> 05:55.655
you need to paint my mug

05:55.724 --> 05:59.103
and the face
of the beautiful Dolly Parton.

06:01.172 --> 06:02.896
Paint your face, honey.

06:02.965 --> 06:05.793
See, this makes
a lot more sense.

06:05.862 --> 06:08.655
Using several coats
of many colors,

06:08.724 --> 06:12.655
inspired by the new
Anastasia Beverly Hills

06:12.724 --> 06:15.172
Norvina lilac palette,

06:15.241 --> 06:17.896
you'll be recreating
the incredible mural

06:17.965 --> 06:19.862
by artist Gus Cutty

06:19.931 --> 06:22.793
located in Asheville,
North Carolina.

06:22.862 --> 06:26.724
Now, queens, I need you
to break into two teams,

06:26.793 --> 06:29.517
a team of three
and a team of four.

06:32.448 --> 06:33.517
Well, that was easy.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.758
DeJa, Jorgeous, Angeria,

06:35.827 --> 06:37.275
you'll be painting my face.

06:37.344 --> 06:39.103
-Yes!
-Ooh, yes!

06:39.172 --> 06:42.448
Lady Camden, Willow Pill,
Daya Betty, and Bosco,

06:42.517 --> 06:45.310
you'll be painting
the face of Dolly Parton.

06:45.379 --> 06:47.206
Yes!

06:47.275 --> 06:50.793
Gear up. You've got
30 minutes to create art.

06:50.862 --> 06:52.724
Ready...

06:52.793 --> 06:53.724
set...

06:53.793 --> 06:54.896
paint for the gods.

06:58.379 --> 07:00.896
Okay, bitches.
Light colors down first.

07:00.965 --> 07:03.172
We're gonna get this set wet,
honey.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.655
I will use this brush.

07:05.724 --> 07:07.103
All right, I'm giving you
shades, guys,

07:07.172 --> 07:08.137
I'm giving you shades.

07:08.206 --> 07:10.103
-Dimension.
-Yes!

07:10.172 --> 07:11.896
Oh, my God!

07:11.965 --> 07:13.827
-Jorgeous!
-Oh, my God!

07:13.896 --> 07:16.241
Jorgeous with
this ginormous brush

07:16.310 --> 07:19.827
looks like a little hamster
in a cartoon, just...

07:21.482 --> 07:23.172
We have seven minutes
to finish her highlights!

07:23.241 --> 07:24.206
Aah!

07:27.068 --> 07:29.310
Put some more mascara
on her eye, bitch.

07:29.379 --> 07:32.000
Oh, my God, you're making her
look like such a drag queen.

07:32.068 --> 07:34.068
Eew.

07:34.137 --> 07:37.586
I am snatching this nose down.

07:37.655 --> 07:40.310
She can't even breathe
how pinched it is.

07:40.379 --> 07:43.137
That nose.

07:43.206 --> 07:46.931
It looks like
if a hot dog had a butt.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.275
Bitch...

07:50.344 --> 07:52.862
Bitch, I don't know what's
going on with this nose. Unnh.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.103
But I think we won.

07:57.068 --> 07:59.689
Queens, we're back!

07:59.758 --> 08:01.068
And we're scared.

08:02.241 --> 08:04.620
One, two, three.

08:08.586 --> 08:10.137
-What do you think?
-Whoa!

08:13.931 --> 08:16.827
Watching RuPaul's face...

08:19.758 --> 08:21.448
Oh, dear.

08:21.517 --> 08:24.137
Oh, well, you got
my wooden teeth right.

08:26.379 --> 08:28.413
I think we've seen enough.

08:28.482 --> 08:30.862
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

08:31.862 --> 08:32.965
Team Dolly.

08:35.517 --> 08:38.827
You've each won $1,500 worth

08:38.896 --> 08:41.068
of Anastasia
Beverly Hills cosmetics.

08:42.620 --> 08:46.413
And queens, thank you all
for trying my new palette.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.413
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

08:48.482 --> 08:51.931
My queens, for this week's
maxi-challenge,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.758
we're having
a good, old-fashioned roast.

08:56.551 --> 08:59.379
And the guest of honor
is our very own...

09:00.620 --> 09:02.241
Ross Mathews.

09:02.310 --> 09:05.448
Since bursting
onto the national scene

09:05.517 --> 09:08.241
as the hilarious intern
on The Tonight Show,

09:08.310 --> 09:12.310
Ross has become America's
sweetheart, bestselling author,

09:12.379 --> 09:16.034
and one of my favorite people
on the planet.

09:16.103 --> 09:19.551
This week, your job
is to rip her to shreds.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.965
Lady Camden, Willow,
Bosco, and Daya Betty,

09:25.034 --> 09:27.000
you won the mini-challenge,

09:27.068 --> 09:30.413
so you get to assign
the order of the roast.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.620
Ooh!

09:31.689 --> 09:34.482
Racers, start your engines,

09:34.551 --> 09:38.379
and may the best drag queen win!

09:39.724 --> 09:41.724
Bitch, this is gonna be
the worst challenge.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.379
Like, I'm a pendeja.

09:43.448 --> 09:45.034
I'm not good
at writing down jokes.

09:45.103 --> 09:49.000
I'm gonna be
in so much fucking trouble.

09:50.758 --> 09:51.758
Coming up...

09:51.827 --> 09:53.103
With a roast,

09:53.172 --> 09:56.310
there's a lot of potential
for embarrassment.

09:56.379 --> 09:58.379
If Ru, Ross, and Michelle
were in a girl group,

09:58.448 --> 10:00.206
it would be called
Destiny's Adopted Child.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.586
You have some work to do.

10:12.517 --> 10:13.413
Yes!

10:13.482 --> 10:14.689
Come on, roast.

10:14.758 --> 10:16.034
Is anyone terrified
of this challenge?

10:16.103 --> 10:17.310
-I'm terrified.
-Very.

10:17.379 --> 10:18.896
I am terrified.

10:18.965 --> 10:22.862
Our maxi-challenge this week
is the roast of Ross Mathews.

10:22.931 --> 10:26.689
And because Team Dolly
won the mini-challenge,

10:26.758 --> 10:30.413
we get to set up
the order of the roast.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.310
So the four of us
get to decide the order.

10:32.379 --> 10:33.655
Yeah!

10:33.724 --> 10:36.103
I do wanna say I would
like to make everybody,

10:36.172 --> 10:37.862
like, somewhat comfortable
in this.

10:37.931 --> 10:38.896
I don't wanna bone anybody.

10:38.965 --> 10:40.551
Before we break off,

10:40.620 --> 10:41.931
do you all
have anything to say?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.172
I would prefer
not to go first or last.

10:43.241 --> 10:44.379
Somewhere in the first half.

10:44.448 --> 10:45.689
I would love to go second,

10:45.758 --> 10:47.034
if that's an option for me.

10:47.103 --> 10:49.517
Your applications are pending.

10:49.586 --> 10:51.620
We'll get back to you
in six to eight weeks.

10:53.034 --> 10:54.379
Let's go have
a little team huddle.

10:54.448 --> 10:58.068
With great power
comes great responsibility.

10:58.137 --> 11:00.000
But at the same time,

11:00.068 --> 11:02.379
as long as I get the spot
that I want,

11:02.448 --> 11:04.482
I do not care
where anyone else goes.

11:04.551 --> 11:07.000
I'm putting my foot down.
I want Saltine.

11:08.965 --> 11:10.482
I know the first
and last spots

11:10.551 --> 11:13.241
are always
the least favorable.

11:13.310 --> 11:15.172
I don't want either.

11:15.241 --> 11:19.482
I'm okay with kind of anything,
just not opening.

11:19.551 --> 11:22.172
After last week's shenanigans,

11:22.241 --> 11:23.724
I'm not trying to start a fight

11:23.793 --> 11:26.448
over any sort of spot
in the roast.

11:26.517 --> 11:29.586
I'm more than willing
to be a team player.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.586
I'm okay with opening.

11:32.655 --> 11:33.965
It doesn't seem like

11:34.034 --> 11:36.137
anybody's chomping at the bit
for that one,

11:36.206 --> 11:37.551
and after last week,

11:37.620 --> 11:40.310
I'm playing it a little bit
less conflict-heavy.

11:40.379 --> 11:43.413
Look at us!

11:46.517 --> 11:48.241
I'd be okay with going third.

11:48.310 --> 11:49.448
It's a little shady,

11:49.517 --> 11:52.172
but I would like
to go after Jorgeous,

11:52.241 --> 11:54.758
because I feel the least
confident in her set.

11:54.827 --> 11:57.103
But she could blow us away.
I have no idea.

11:57.172 --> 11:59.103
I mean...

11:59.172 --> 12:00.103
we'll see.

12:00.172 --> 12:02.620
Uh, mm, well, I don't know.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.793
Like, I want to be
in the middle.

12:05.862 --> 12:07.310
Like, dead middle.

12:07.379 --> 12:09.482
What about five
and Angie's four?

12:09.551 --> 12:10.620
-Sure.
-Okay.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.517
How do you feel
about sixth or seventh?

12:12.586 --> 12:13.862
It's you and DeJa.

12:13.931 --> 12:15.896
But DeJa said
she doesn't want to.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.482
-But--
-Fuck that shit.

12:17.551 --> 12:18.620
If you want to go sixth,
go sixth

12:18.689 --> 12:19.896
and put DeJa last.

12:19.965 --> 12:21.965
I'm just wondering
if I'm capable of, like,

12:22.034 --> 12:23.482
bringing it home, you know?

12:23.551 --> 12:26.103
If I go last, then I have
to be really fucking funny,

12:26.172 --> 12:30.137
and if I don't go last,
then I'm playing it safe.

12:30.206 --> 12:31.965
I have that weird butterfly
feeling in my stomach,

12:32.034 --> 12:34.172
where it's like, eee.

12:34.241 --> 12:35.310
Do it, you know what I mean?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.758
Like, move towards
your discomfort?

12:36.827 --> 12:38.034
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:38.103 --> 12:40.793
I need to continue
to sort of push myself

12:40.862 --> 12:42.241
off of that scary ledge,

12:42.310 --> 12:44.310
because whenever
I don't do that,

12:44.379 --> 12:46.689
I just fade
into the background.

12:46.758 --> 12:48.965
I'm gonna go last.
Fuck it.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.275
-Okay, baby.
-All right, do it.

12:51.689 --> 12:53.655
Oh, they're back.

12:53.724 --> 12:55.034
What's the tea, sugarfoot?

12:55.103 --> 12:57.413
Okay, Bosco's going to open.

12:57.482 --> 12:58.620
-Werk!
-Perfect.

12:58.689 --> 12:59.724
Miss Jorgeous
will be going second.

12:59.793 --> 13:01.034
Oh, my God, yes.

13:01.103 --> 13:02.172
Thank you all,
thank y'all, thank y'all.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.517
Willow will be going third.

13:03.586 --> 13:06.586
-Angie's next, so fourth.
-Okay.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.724
I will be going five.

13:08.793 --> 13:10.758
-DeJa will be going sixth.
-Okay.

13:10.827 --> 13:12.517
And Cam will be going last.

13:12.586 --> 13:13.896
Yay!

13:13.965 --> 13:15.586
There is no room
for complaints.

13:15.655 --> 13:18.103
Nobody set you up.
Everybody got what they wanted.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.413
If you suck, you suck.

13:20.482 --> 13:22.344
Sucks to suck,
as my grandma used to say.

13:22.413 --> 13:26.379
Okay, now time to change
my diaper and start writing.

13:26.448 --> 13:28.000
Yay!

13:28.068 --> 13:31.068
Roasting the Ross.

13:31.137 --> 13:34.344
The roast of Ross.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.068
Willow, how are you feeling
about all of this?

13:37.137 --> 13:40.000
Oh, my God.

13:44.931 --> 13:47.068
I've never done a roast before,

13:47.137 --> 13:50.551
and it is just
a whole 'nother ballpark.

13:50.620 --> 13:54.000
You have to tell lots of jokes,

13:54.068 --> 13:55.586
have all of them land,

13:55.655 --> 13:58.724
and make sure that
you're not the joke at the end.

13:58.793 --> 13:59.931
Okay, how do you like this one?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Ross, I like to imagine
you and Carson

14:02.068 --> 14:03.206
are secretly in love.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.758
But since you're both
loose bottoms,

14:04.827 --> 14:06.793
you have sex by leaning against
opposite sides of the couch

14:06.862 --> 14:08.103
and running backwards.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.034
Wait. What?

14:12.103 --> 14:16.896
With a roast, there's a lot
of potential for embarrassment.

14:19.482 --> 14:20.862
-How you doing?
-Bad.

14:20.931 --> 14:23.034
Girl, I feel you.

14:23.103 --> 14:24.551
Like, I literally
don't even know how to begin.

14:24.620 --> 14:25.586
What do your notes say?

14:25.655 --> 14:27.310
"Thank you, Angeria."

14:30.000 --> 14:31.965
Oh, my God.

14:32.034 --> 14:33.034
By the way, you guys,

14:33.103 --> 14:34.620
this is a roast,
so no holds bar.

14:34.689 --> 14:36.620
Go for the jugular.

14:36.689 --> 14:37.724
Yeah.

14:37.793 --> 14:38.724
Or all my chins.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.827
DeJa is just such a fun person.

14:43.896 --> 14:45.275
She's probably gonna deliver
something pretty great,

14:45.344 --> 14:48.758
as long as she doesn't
veer into dad joke country.

14:48.827 --> 14:50.413
I kind of wanted to do,
like, something dumb.

14:50.482 --> 14:53.103
Like...

14:53.172 --> 14:56.241
if Ru, Ross, and Michelle
were in a girl group,

14:56.310 --> 14:58.068
it would be called
Destiny's Adopted Child.

14:58.137 --> 15:00.517
Huh?

15:00.586 --> 15:02.103
You have some work to do.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.206
It's not that
the joke's not funny.

15:05.275 --> 15:10.206
I mean, I'm just
kind of not laughing.

15:10.275 --> 15:13.793
Well, then I guess that means
the joke wasn't funny.

15:13.862 --> 15:16.827
But...
Yeah, the joke wasn't funny.

15:19.034 --> 15:21.172
Coming up...

15:21.241 --> 15:22.965
Last week I had
the dubious honor

15:23.034 --> 15:25.482
of being told
that I should go home.

15:25.551 --> 15:27.034
Cool.

15:27.103 --> 15:28.517
Eh.

15:28.586 --> 15:31.275
Why does it smell like
45 ounces of bounce that ass?

15:31.344 --> 15:32.379
Mm-mm.

15:32.448 --> 15:34.344
This is what a man in a wig

15:34.413 --> 15:36.000
is supposed to look like.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.034
Is that funny?

15:44.379 --> 15:45.827
-Hello!
-Oh, hello!

15:45.896 --> 15:48.034
-Hi, Bosco.
-Hi.

15:48.103 --> 15:49.724
It's time to meet
with the comedy coaches.

15:49.793 --> 15:51.758
We're gonna find out
if any of my jokes are funny.

15:51.827 --> 15:52.758
Dulcé Sloan is here.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.275
-Hi!
-Hello!

15:54.344 --> 15:56.655
She will help us
through our journey.

15:56.724 --> 15:58.344
Okay, and it's gonna be
a journey.

15:58.413 --> 16:00.586
Have you done a roast before?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.103
I've done a lot of,
like, hosting gigs.

16:02.172 --> 16:03.724
Well, you're kind of
a shady bitch.

16:03.793 --> 16:05.310
Kinda.

16:05.379 --> 16:08.068
Shady bitch. What a great
foundation to be on.

16:08.137 --> 16:10.655
-So let's get started.
-Okay.

16:10.724 --> 16:13.655
My name is Bosco,
and I'm still here.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.724
Last week,
I had the dubious honor

16:15.793 --> 16:17.241
of being told
by every competitor

16:17.310 --> 16:19.344
that I should go home.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.758
Cool.

16:20.827 --> 16:22.931
That's observational
and it's cute,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.965
but if it's not funny enough

16:26.034 --> 16:28.931
and then you follow it up
with deadpan "cool,"

16:29.000 --> 16:31.137
it's not gonna work.

16:31.206 --> 16:33.379
There's no punchline
to that joke.

16:33.448 --> 16:34.586
Gotcha.

16:34.655 --> 16:36.103
And the first thing
Michelle said,

16:36.172 --> 16:37.586
that you were a shady bitch,
I didn't get shady bitch.

16:37.655 --> 16:40.689
I have a very dry
sense of humor,

16:40.758 --> 16:43.068
and sometimes
dry sense of humor

16:43.137 --> 16:45.896
does not always read
to everybody.

16:45.965 --> 16:48.103
But let's talk a little bit
about your career, Ross.

16:48.172 --> 16:50.896
Leslie Jordan walked
so you could prance.

16:50.965 --> 16:52.068
Um...

16:52.137 --> 16:53.586
Oh, I get it.

16:53.655 --> 16:55.172
It's a roast.

16:55.241 --> 16:57.413
Make this bitch Boston Market.
Like, roast.

16:57.482 --> 16:58.551
Gotcha.

16:58.620 --> 16:59.793
And also,
you're opening this.

16:59.862 --> 17:01.551
-You chose to go first.
-I did.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.620
-You chose to go first?
-You chose to go first.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.379
-I did.
-Why?

17:04.448 --> 17:07.206
I have a lot to prove
after last week.

17:07.275 --> 17:09.448
You know, last week,
Ru said "Who should go home,"

17:09.517 --> 17:11.344
and they all chose Bosco.

17:11.413 --> 17:13.448
-Everybody chose you?
-Everybody chose me.

17:13.517 --> 17:15.344
You better come out here
with guns blazing.

17:15.413 --> 17:16.724
That's what it has to be
right now.

17:16.793 --> 17:18.793
There are things in here.

17:18.862 --> 17:20.310
Be funnier, be deliberate.

17:20.379 --> 17:21.413
-Yes.
-Okay.

17:21.482 --> 17:23.172
Let us know what
you're here to do.

17:23.241 --> 17:28.068
If they want bigger punchlines
and they want more meat,

17:28.137 --> 17:29.206
where's the meat?

17:29.275 --> 17:30.206
I will give them the meat.

17:30.275 --> 17:32.000
Hey, Willow.

17:32.068 --> 17:34.000
Let's hear what you got.

17:34.068 --> 17:35.310
RuPaul, it's no secret

17:35.379 --> 17:37.034
you're a little intimidating
to us queens,

17:37.103 --> 17:39.793
but to curb my fear of you,
I have to remember

17:39.862 --> 17:41.344
that all of your talent
and creativity

17:41.413 --> 17:43.137
has gone into smash hits

17:43.206 --> 17:47.275
like Christmas Cookies
and Christmas Cookies 2.0.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.931
The first part of it's
too long.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.068
-Say it again.
-It's no secret

17:53.137 --> 17:54.551
you're a little intimidating
to us queens,

17:54.620 --> 17:56.448
but to curb my enthubia--
ugh, sorry.

17:56.517 --> 17:57.724
To curb my fear of you--

17:57.793 --> 17:59.724
I just wanna introduce
the phrase to you

17:59.793 --> 18:01.172
"economy of words."

18:01.241 --> 18:03.517
Get to the funny
as soon as you possibly can.

18:03.586 --> 18:04.689
-Succinct.
-Okay.

18:04.758 --> 18:07.103
Succinct. Yeah. College.

18:07.172 --> 18:10.931
My comedy
is rambling absurdity,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.655
but the setup that usually works
for the roasts

18:14.724 --> 18:16.137
is like setup, joke,
punchline, boom.

18:16.206 --> 18:18.724
Move on. Next, next,
next, next, next,

18:18.793 --> 18:20.965
and that is not easy
to do at all.

18:22.586 --> 18:24.000
All right, Angie,
let us have it.

18:24.068 --> 18:26.448
Well, all right.
Now that nap time is over,

18:26.517 --> 18:29.724
I am here
to wake y'all bitches up.

18:29.793 --> 18:31.068
-Okay.
-Okay.

18:32.965 --> 18:34.275
You got us.
We're ready.

18:34.344 --> 18:35.413
-Hey!
-I'm up!

18:35.482 --> 18:37.793
I'm coming in loud
and in charge,

18:37.862 --> 18:39.482
and just doing what Angie does.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.551
When I think of the name
Ross Mathews,

18:41.620 --> 18:43.241
I think of motels:

18:43.310 --> 18:45.137
always open
and filthy as fuck.

18:45.206 --> 18:47.758
Always open and...

18:47.827 --> 18:49.206
And filthy as fuck.

18:51.551 --> 18:53.413
Cool? Okay, keep going.

18:53.482 --> 18:54.620
-Eh.
-It's all right, it's all right.

18:54.689 --> 18:55.827
-Eh!
-It's all right.

18:55.896 --> 18:56.793
-Well, hey, we getting there.
-Eh!

18:56.862 --> 18:58.586
Okay. Okay.

18:58.655 --> 19:01.206
Ross, you have a fabulous job.

19:01.275 --> 19:05.034
I mean, I know people that
would kill to work on this show

19:05.103 --> 19:06.724
and be the understudy
for Carson Kressley.

19:06.793 --> 19:08.793
That's cute.

19:08.862 --> 19:10.172
-Hey, there we go. That's one.
-I like that one.

19:10.241 --> 19:11.310
-That's cute.
-Okay.

19:11.379 --> 19:12.758
Like, well, as long as I'm

19:12.827 --> 19:14.137
getting a little giggle
out you, girl,

19:14.206 --> 19:16.965
I feel good about
what I have cooking.

19:18.206 --> 19:21.137
Daya, are you excited
for this challenge?

19:21.206 --> 19:22.344
I am terrified
for this challenge.

19:22.413 --> 19:23.862
Are you?

19:23.931 --> 19:26.965
I don't have any reads
for Ru right now.

19:27.034 --> 19:28.137
Okay, quick note.

19:28.206 --> 19:29.413
Do not tell us
what you don't have,

19:29.482 --> 19:31.068
because it makes us feel
like you're unprepared.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.620
What do you have?
Start with that.

19:32.689 --> 19:34.034
Okay.

19:34.103 --> 19:37.206
So, now, girls, I want you
to look at Michelle.

19:37.275 --> 19:40.655
This is what a man in a wig
is supposed to look like.

19:40.724 --> 19:41.862
Okay.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.482
I am thinking, oh, God,
this is awful.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.931
She's gonna hate it.
This is not gonna go well.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.137
Who is your doctor?

19:49.206 --> 19:51.655
That way, when the money
starts coming in,

19:51.724 --> 19:53.379
I know who to stay away from

19:53.448 --> 19:54.620
if I'm gonna get
cosmetic surgery.

19:54.689 --> 19:56.517
That's funny.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.586
-Okay, perfect.
-That's funny.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.310
But then she starts chuckling,
she starts laughing.

20:01.379 --> 20:04.931
Ross Mathews, you're so gay,
your favorite candy is PrEP.

20:06.068 --> 20:08.206
That's funny!

20:08.275 --> 20:09.448
So that's all the jokes
you have written.

20:09.517 --> 20:11.965
That's all I have as of now.

20:12.034 --> 20:13.275
Hey, you got some funny jokes.

20:13.344 --> 20:14.448
So now go write some more.

20:15.827 --> 20:17.344
-Well, hello!
-DeJa!

20:17.413 --> 20:19.000
Baby, baby!

20:19.068 --> 20:20.241
So let's see what you've got.

20:20.310 --> 20:22.517
All right, so Daya
is the person before me.

20:22.586 --> 20:25.413
So Daya looks like what
a five-year-old would draw

20:25.482 --> 20:27.758
if a five-year-old
would draw Bigfoot.

20:29.689 --> 20:31.206
-Mm-mm.
-No.

20:31.275 --> 20:32.482
-Mm-mm.
-Okay.

20:32.551 --> 20:34.103
Michelle, this hair
is everything,

20:34.172 --> 20:35.413
but I will say

20:35.482 --> 20:38.000
you officially look like
Pepe Le Pew's asshole.

20:38.068 --> 20:40.413
Okay. Is that funny?

20:41.448 --> 20:42.655
Is that funny?

20:44.413 --> 20:47.172
I was, like, I thought it was.

20:49.172 --> 20:50.379
What joke would you think
is the strongest

20:50.448 --> 20:52.724
that you would use
as your opening joke?

20:52.793 --> 20:53.896
Um...

20:56.137 --> 20:57.379
Which one--
what are you laughing at?

20:57.448 --> 20:58.620
Tell me, tell me, tell me.

20:58.689 --> 20:59.931
I'm literally just
trying to figure out

21:00.000 --> 21:01.896
what was my funniest joke.

21:01.965 --> 21:02.965
And you should know that.

21:03.034 --> 21:05.620
Was the Bigfoot one funny?

21:05.689 --> 21:06.965
-No.
-Not really.

21:07.034 --> 21:08.448
Not really. Okay.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.310
I will work on that.

21:10.379 --> 21:12.103
Okay, but what you do need
are funny jokes.

21:12.172 --> 21:14.000
Yes.

21:14.068 --> 21:16.655
It's gonna be the roast
of DeJa Skye.

21:17.724 --> 21:20.896
-Hi, Lady Camden!
-Hello!

21:20.965 --> 21:23.620
Let us hear what you've got,
and we'll guide you.

21:23.689 --> 21:25.517
There before the grace of gays,
Michelle Visage.

21:25.586 --> 21:26.896
A lot of people
don't actually know

21:26.965 --> 21:28.689
that you are
a talented dancer,

21:28.758 --> 21:30.862
because you are not.

21:33.034 --> 21:34.137
Yes, I am!

21:34.206 --> 21:35.862
No, Michelle,
you have two left feet.

21:35.931 --> 21:37.655
They have left your body
completely.

21:39.655 --> 21:40.620
Yes.

21:40.689 --> 21:42.586
That is fucking hilarious.

21:42.655 --> 21:44.000
You like that?

21:44.068 --> 21:47.103
Am I a comedian?

21:47.172 --> 21:49.310
Ross Mathews, you are so gay

21:49.379 --> 21:51.137
that when I shout "Hello"
into your asshole,

21:51.206 --> 21:53.344
it echoes back gayer.

21:55.413 --> 21:56.793
Can't you just say,

21:56.862 --> 21:59.758
"You are so gay that
even your farts have a lisp?"

21:59.827 --> 22:00.896
Right. Ha-ha-ha!

22:00.965 --> 22:02.275
Succinct, to the point.

22:02.344 --> 22:04.068
Yep. When you try
to make something work

22:04.137 --> 22:06.241
that's not working, that's when
you put too many words there.

22:06.310 --> 22:09.517
You got this, and you got
some funny stuff there, Camden.

22:10.655 --> 22:12.620
-Helloteous.
-Okay.

22:12.689 --> 22:13.965
Bitch, you're painted.

22:14.034 --> 22:15.862
Thank you for
the cheap seats always.

22:15.931 --> 22:18.344
Yes, and Michelle, you know
you're always painted, too.

22:18.413 --> 22:20.827
-Always, Jorgeous.
-Okay.

22:20.896 --> 22:22.000
Okay, thank you
for the compliments.

22:22.068 --> 22:23.275
-Let's hear your jokes, baby.
-Okay.

22:24.724 --> 22:26.172
Oh, my God, I am honestly

22:26.241 --> 22:29.241
so nervous about
sharing my material.

22:29.310 --> 22:33.931
I met Ross Mathews one time
at a club that I work at,

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
and this bitch
was twerking everywhere.

22:36.068 --> 22:38.068
And all I could think was,

22:38.137 --> 22:40.965
"Why does it smell like
45 ounces of bounce that ass?"

22:42.827 --> 22:44.310
45 ounces...

22:44.379 --> 22:46.275
-Of bounce that ass.

22:46.344 --> 22:48.482
-I'm glad you're laughing.
-Okay.

22:48.551 --> 22:49.448
-Mm-mm.
-Really?

22:49.517 --> 22:50.896
Not funny.

22:50.965 --> 22:52.931
When I'm giving you any
amount of bouncing that ass,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.137
it's a good day for everybody.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.172
-Okay.
-I'll take it.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.172
So let's go back on that joke.

22:56.241 --> 22:57.172
-Yes.
-Okay.

22:57.241 --> 22:58.620
Ross was so fucked up.

22:58.689 --> 23:01.379
She was twerking everywhere,
and, bitch, it stunk.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.965
Like, it smelled.

23:03.034 --> 23:05.103
Are you telling me that
because the ass was bouncing,

23:05.172 --> 23:07.344
I am getting an aroma of anus?

23:07.413 --> 23:09.000
-Yes, exactly.
-Okay.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.793
-Can we hear more?
-Yes.

23:13.862 --> 23:15.862
Ross Mathews, it's so good

23:15.931 --> 23:18.620
to see you lose all that
weight and the baby.

23:22.827 --> 23:26.586
People have very serious
feelings about losing babies.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.137
Oh, okay.

23:28.206 --> 23:33.413
So you might wanna stay away
from any of that.

23:33.482 --> 23:34.931
Like, he gave birth
to the baby.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.275
That's what I was
trying to do, think of.

23:36.344 --> 23:37.793
Oh, well, this is how
you say it.

23:37.862 --> 23:40.448
Ross, it's so amazing
that you lost all that weight.

23:40.517 --> 23:41.724
How's the baby?

23:41.793 --> 23:43.275
-How's the baby? Okay.
-Ha, yes.

23:43.344 --> 23:45.344
What else do you have for Ross,
because this is a roast of Ross.

23:45.413 --> 23:47.137
Honestly, this is all
I have right now.

23:47.206 --> 23:48.689
Jorgeous!

23:48.758 --> 23:52.379
You can't be afraid
to make jokes.

23:52.448 --> 23:53.517
They just have to be funny.

23:53.586 --> 23:56.137
Okay. Okay.

23:56.206 --> 23:58.448
Honestly, this challenge
is, like, so difficult.

23:58.517 --> 24:00.758
I don't see myself
as a funny person.

24:00.827 --> 24:02.724
-You gotta let that go.
-I know.

24:02.793 --> 24:04.068
When you're talking
to your friends, do they laugh?

24:04.137 --> 24:05.551
-Yes.
-Yeah?

24:05.620 --> 24:08.000
You know you sit up and badmouth
bitches all the time

24:08.068 --> 24:09.586
when you're sitting there
with your best homegirl.

24:09.655 --> 24:10.862
That's how you talk to Ross.

24:10.931 --> 24:13.517
And you turn that into a joke.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.482
Write it down.

24:14.551 --> 24:15.931
Okay.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.620
Ugh, I just guess I need
to add that Jorgeous flair,

24:18.689 --> 24:21.344
even though they've been
telling me for weeks to add it,

24:21.413 --> 24:23.068
and I still
haven't figured it out.

24:23.137 --> 24:25.379
And it's just, like, come on.

24:29.448 --> 24:30.931
-Hey.
-Oh, she's back.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.275
-What's the tea?
-It was fucking awful.

24:33.344 --> 24:34.448
Really?

24:34.517 --> 24:35.827
And I'm just over it
at this point.

24:35.896 --> 24:37.379
I don't know what to do.

24:37.448 --> 24:39.931
Um, yeah.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.448
They were like,
just talk with your homegirls,

24:42.517 --> 24:43.655
like how you talk
with your homegirls.

24:43.724 --> 24:45.448
I'm like, okay, like,

24:45.517 --> 24:47.310
that was obvious,
you know what I mean?

24:47.379 --> 24:49.655
But, like, whatever happens
happens at this point.

24:49.724 --> 24:51.689
Honestly, I don't care.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.586
Jorgeous,
don't give up, sister.

24:53.655 --> 24:55.034
I know.

24:55.103 --> 24:57.620
Sometimes Jorgeous
is super confident

24:57.689 --> 24:59.793
and is ready to slay all of us.

24:59.862 --> 25:02.448
Other times,
she's totally in her head

25:02.517 --> 25:04.586
and kind of checking out
of the competition.

25:04.655 --> 25:08.379
Right now,
she just can't give up.

25:08.448 --> 25:09.689
You are a superstar.

25:09.758 --> 25:13.000
Bitch, not after
this fucking shit.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.517
Coming up...

25:16.586 --> 25:19.034
I am tapping into
this humorous side of me.

25:19.103 --> 25:21.931
We have to roast and bake
at the same time.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.896
Honestly...

25:25.482 --> 25:27.379
So funny, Lady Camden.

25:36.344 --> 25:37.931
Good morning!

25:38.000 --> 25:39.206
Oh!

25:39.275 --> 25:41.172
Time to roast a bitch!

25:41.241 --> 25:45.655
Today's maxi-challenge
is the Ross Mathews roast.

25:45.724 --> 25:48.517
I love him,
but I'm gonna read him.

25:48.586 --> 25:52.241
So we have to roast and bake
at the same time.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.068
Going into this roast,

25:54.137 --> 25:56.310
I'm way more excited
than I thought I was gonna be.

25:56.379 --> 25:58.103
So funny, Lady Camden.

25:58.172 --> 26:00.000
You are a genius.

26:00.068 --> 26:01.586
What?

26:01.655 --> 26:04.413
I am tapping into this kind of,
like, humorous side of me,

26:04.482 --> 26:06.172
and I'm feeling like my wings

26:06.241 --> 26:08.103
are starting to kind of
expand a little bit.

26:08.172 --> 26:09.586
Maybe I'll just keep
writing stuff down

26:09.655 --> 26:11.379
as I'm gluing my eyebrows.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.103
Bosco, you get to open
the show, darling.

26:16.172 --> 26:18.172
-I do get to open the show.
-Are you feeling confident?

26:18.241 --> 26:19.448
I like my set.

26:19.517 --> 26:21.896
It feels really tight
and put together,

26:21.965 --> 26:24.689
and I pride myself
on being very tight.

26:24.758 --> 26:26.586
What about you, Miss Thing?

26:26.655 --> 26:30.241
Yesterday they seemed to get
my humor, which was good.

26:30.310 --> 26:32.275
I only had half of my set,

26:32.344 --> 26:37.241
so hopefully the rest of my set
is just as good, if not better.

26:37.310 --> 26:38.275
What about you, Jorgie-Porgie?

26:38.344 --> 26:40.586
Oh, girl, I feel awful.

26:40.655 --> 26:42.034
You feel awful?

26:42.103 --> 26:45.310
I'm not excited about
this challenge whatsoever.

26:45.379 --> 26:47.379
I'm trying my best,

26:47.448 --> 26:50.137
and, like, lately my best
hasn't been good enough.

26:50.206 --> 26:52.034
I feel like y'all
got it so together, though.

26:52.103 --> 26:55.103
It's really intimidating,
not gonna lie.

26:55.172 --> 26:57.793
Remember how you felt during
that Lip Sync Lalaparuza

26:57.862 --> 26:59.310
where you were like,
I'm not bothered?

26:59.379 --> 27:00.758
I'm not going anywhere.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.241
Like, try to find that.

27:02.310 --> 27:04.241
I can't figure it out.
I really can't, you know?

27:04.310 --> 27:06.275
It's definitely an
"easier said than done" thing.

27:06.344 --> 27:07.689
Yes.

27:07.758 --> 27:10.172
Honestly, I'm just
not confident going into this.

27:10.241 --> 27:11.758
Like...

27:13.482 --> 27:16.413
Lip syncing is something that
I do not wanna have to rely on,

27:16.482 --> 27:19.517
but if it comes down to it,
girl, I'm ready.

27:22.586 --> 27:23.586
I'm gonna be laughing
at everything,

27:23.655 --> 27:25.103
even if it's not funny,

27:25.172 --> 27:28.448
and I expect the same
from my sisters.

27:28.517 --> 27:32.448
I was at the bottom day one,
and I progressively got better.

27:32.517 --> 27:34.551
I have won a challenge,
Yay-ya!

27:34.620 --> 27:36.413
I have a top multiple times.

27:36.482 --> 27:38.275
I deserve to go
to that next level.

27:38.344 --> 27:40.551
It's so close.
Like, I just--

27:40.620 --> 27:42.965
It's right there,
so tangible I can taste it.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.413
Can I see that extra
spongy-sponge?

27:47.482 --> 27:48.758
Yeah, you're gonna have
to definitely wash it,

27:48.827 --> 27:49.862
because it's, like,
old and gross.

27:49.931 --> 27:53.034
-Whoa.
-I know.

27:53.103 --> 27:54.896
What is this?

27:54.965 --> 27:57.965
This looks like you had,
like, a third testicle

27:58.034 --> 28:00.586
that you, like, cut off
and then handed it to me.

28:00.655 --> 28:02.517
That thing is disgusting.

28:02.586 --> 28:03.689
It's the risk of it all.

28:03.758 --> 28:05.068
-What is that?
-Fuck.

28:05.137 --> 28:07.724
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers, Bosco.

28:07.793 --> 28:09.931
-Absolutely not!
-Beggars can't be choosers.

28:33.724 --> 28:36.310
-Yes, bitch.
-Yes.

28:36.379 --> 28:38.000
Wow, wow, wow.

28:38.068 --> 28:40.862
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

28:40.931 --> 28:42.172
Michelle Visage.

28:42.241 --> 28:43.689
Now, how do you like
your roast?

28:43.758 --> 28:47.241
Gluten-free and vegan with
a side of spotted dick, please.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.931
Yum!

28:49.000 --> 28:52.931
And our man of the hour,
the hilarious Ross Mathews.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.896
Ross, will you be having
the roast tonight?

28:55.965 --> 28:57.413
Sure, but would
you tell the chef

28:57.482 --> 28:59.241
I like my roast well done?

28:59.310 --> 29:01.344
Burn!

29:01.413 --> 29:03.689
-Welcome, Dulcé Sloan!

29:03.758 --> 29:07.068
Now, I hear the roast
started yesterday.

29:07.137 --> 29:09.413
You call it a roast.
I call it tough love.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.862
This week,
we challenged our queens

29:12.931 --> 29:15.379
to show off their comedy chops

29:15.448 --> 29:19.586
at the first-ever
Ross Mathews roast.

29:19.655 --> 29:22.137
Racers, start your engines,

29:22.206 --> 29:24.965
and may the best drag queen win.

29:25.034 --> 29:26.482
Coming up...

29:26.551 --> 29:28.896
Ross is proof that you
do not need a deep voice.

29:28.965 --> 29:30.137
You just need a deep throat.

29:32.034 --> 29:34.931
You are the only man
that I know

29:35.000 --> 29:37.586
that masturbates
to Lifetime movie network.

29:46.310 --> 29:50.068
Live from Television City
in Sylmar,

29:50.137 --> 29:53.724
it's the Ross Mathews roast.

29:53.793 --> 29:57.620
First up, Bosco.

29:57.689 --> 29:58.965
Jesus, thank you.

29:59.034 --> 30:00.793
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

30:00.862 --> 30:06.034
Welcome to the roast
of the legendary Ross Mathews.

30:08.068 --> 30:09.517
Before we get started,
I do wanna take a moment

30:09.586 --> 30:11.482
and talk about myself.

30:11.551 --> 30:12.758
Oh!

30:12.827 --> 30:14.517
So last week
I had the legendary honor

30:14.586 --> 30:18.965
to be told to go home by each
and every one of my competitors,

30:19.034 --> 30:22.827
everyone on the panel,
and by RuPaul.

30:22.896 --> 30:24.000
I have been told to go home

30:24.068 --> 30:26.241
more times than Ross
at White Party.

30:27.724 --> 30:30.379
I have been told to go home
more times than Michelle

30:30.448 --> 30:32.896
every time she visits the UK.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.724
I have been told to go home
more times than RuPaul

30:35.793 --> 30:38.413
when she tells her record
company she has a new song.

30:40.413 --> 30:42.586
I understand the critiques.

30:42.655 --> 30:45.103
You're tired of the bras,
you're tired of the corsets.

30:45.172 --> 30:46.896
You wanna see versatility.

30:46.965 --> 30:49.965
I'll show you versatility
when Willow passes a drug test.

30:50.034 --> 30:52.206
-Oh, shit.
-I'll show you versatility

30:52.275 --> 30:54.206
when Jorgeous wins
an acting challenge

30:54.275 --> 30:56.482
and passes a drug test.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.655
RuPaul, you are so old

30:59.724 --> 31:01.379
that when you say
that you were vers,

31:01.448 --> 31:03.965
you mean you were
both hunter and gatherer.

31:05.586 --> 31:10.103
And Ross, the man of the hour,
the reason for the season.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.965
When you say that you were vers,
no one believes you.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.310
But for real, I adore you.

31:17.379 --> 31:19.448
Ross is not a top.

31:19.517 --> 31:21.137
He's a blouse.

31:23.551 --> 31:26.482
I'm gonna go ahead
and bring on our next girl.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.448
If you hated my corsets,

31:28.517 --> 31:30.103
I'm sure you're gonna love
her swimsuits.

31:30.172 --> 31:31.241
Okay.

31:31.310 --> 31:32.275
It's Jorgeous.

31:34.172 --> 31:37.413
Hi, you nasty bitches.

31:37.482 --> 31:40.862
You know, RuPaul, I thought
I was gonna be competing

31:40.931 --> 31:43.310
with succulent, decadent,
gorgeous queens.

31:43.379 --> 31:47.310
Instead, I'm getting
a linebacker,

31:47.379 --> 31:48.517
Lurch,

31:48.586 --> 31:50.793
and the Crimson Chin bitch.

31:50.862 --> 31:53.827
Speaking of linebackers,
hi, Michelle.

31:53.896 --> 31:55.344
Ooh!

31:58.172 --> 32:00.862
I just wanna say it's so crazy

32:00.931 --> 32:04.068
to think that your plastic
surgery is older than me.

32:05.137 --> 32:07.137
I didn't have any, but okay.

32:07.206 --> 32:09.586
I just also wanna say RuPaul,
it is so crazy

32:09.655 --> 32:12.724
that I've known about you
ever since I was in diapers.

32:12.793 --> 32:14.172
Now you're the one in diapers.

32:14.241 --> 32:16.275
It's funny 'cause it's true!

32:17.620 --> 32:20.379
I could smell it, girl,
I could smell it.

32:22.310 --> 32:26.965
Now, the most nastiest bitch
of the hour, Miss Ross Mathews.

32:27.034 --> 32:28.482
Helloteous. Good morning.

32:28.551 --> 32:30.655
-Hi.
-Oh, my God, you're so gay

32:30.724 --> 32:32.931
that your asshole
sounds like a turkey.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.620
Blblblbl.

32:34.689 --> 32:37.620
It's so good to see you
lose all that weight.

32:37.689 --> 32:38.896
How's the baby?

32:45.206 --> 32:49.344
Surprisingly, Jorgeous
has, like, good energy up there.

32:49.413 --> 32:51.172
I just wanna bring
onto the next stage--

32:51.241 --> 32:55.758
I mean, I just wanna bring--

32:55.827 --> 32:59.758
But Jorgeous' roast is not good.

32:59.827 --> 33:02.827
I just wanna bring to the stage
the gremlin of the season,

33:02.896 --> 33:04.310
Miss Willow Pill.

33:04.379 --> 33:07.310
Thank y'all very much!

33:07.379 --> 33:08.931
Everybody give it up
for Jorgeous.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.379
-Yes!
-She really tried her darnedest.

33:13.413 --> 33:14.931
You know, the judges
are always saying

33:15.000 --> 33:16.827
Jorgeous was born for drag.

33:16.896 --> 33:18.172
She's also gonna die for it.

33:19.379 --> 33:20.310
Because RuPaul's
gonna sacrifice her

33:20.379 --> 33:22.000
for seven more years of life.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.172
All that's gonna be left

33:24.241 --> 33:26.275
is the world's tiniest
sequined bra.

33:28.517 --> 33:31.620
I think what I love most
about the cast is the diversity.

33:31.689 --> 33:34.103
We have Bosco,

33:34.172 --> 33:36.655
who looks like the child
of Kurt and Courtney,

33:36.724 --> 33:39.413
Daya, who looks like the child
of Ozzy and Sharon,

33:39.482 --> 33:40.793
and we have Camden,

33:40.862 --> 33:42.965
who looks like the child
of a brother and sister.

33:46.206 --> 33:47.206
You fucking bitch!

33:47.275 --> 33:48.620
But enough about
these hooligans.

33:48.689 --> 33:49.965
I wanna talk about these judges.

33:50.034 --> 33:51.965
Michelle, you pride yourself

33:52.034 --> 33:55.517
on being a singer,
an actor, and a dancer,

33:55.586 --> 33:57.551
and only three of those
are a lie.

34:00.034 --> 34:02.379
On to the man of the hour,

34:02.448 --> 34:05.724
Carson Kressley's arch nemesis,
Ross Mathews.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.103
That's me.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.862
Truly you are
a very, very handsome lesbian.

34:12.206 --> 34:14.137
It took me about five years
to realize

34:14.206 --> 34:16.137
you and Fortune Feimster
were different people.

34:16.206 --> 34:18.172
Oh, my God!

34:18.241 --> 34:19.724
That's my roast, but I'm
gonna bring up our next guest.

34:19.793 --> 34:22.344
She combines the grace
of Diana Ross

34:22.413 --> 34:24.551
and the beauty
of Rumpelstiltskin.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.448
Give it up for Angeria!

34:28.586 --> 34:30.689
Well, hello, everybody.

34:30.758 --> 34:32.103
-Oh, hello.
-All right.

34:32.172 --> 34:33.724
Well, now that nap time is over,

34:33.793 --> 34:35.275
I'm here to do what I do best,

34:35.344 --> 34:36.448
and that's read a bitch.

34:36.517 --> 34:37.965
-Ooh!
-All right.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.448
Now, wait a minute.

34:39.517 --> 34:42.034
Now, let's start with our
beautiful panel of judges.

34:42.103 --> 34:46.586
Mama Ru, in drag, you are like
the supermodel of the world.

34:46.655 --> 34:50.068
But outta drag, you are like
the superintendent of schools.

34:50.137 --> 34:52.758
Bitch, half the time,
I don't know

34:52.827 --> 34:55.206
whether I'm about to get
eliminated or expelled.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.068
Michelle Visage,

34:59.137 --> 35:01.482
the inspiration
behind the invention

35:01.551 --> 35:03.482
commonly known
as the glory hole,

35:03.551 --> 35:07.413
because men would rather look
at a blank wall than yo face.

35:07.482 --> 35:11.275
And the diet version
of Lizzo herself,

35:11.344 --> 35:14.103
it's Dulcé Sloan, baby.

35:14.172 --> 35:16.862
Baby, how you feeling?
Okay as hell?

35:18.172 --> 35:19.482
All right, honey.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.931
We are all here tonight
to honor one man.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.793
Well, unfortunately,
that man was unavailable,

35:24.862 --> 35:28.517
so we got a woman instead:
Ross Mathews.

35:28.586 --> 35:30.655
If you were on Drag Race,
I am pretty sure

35:30.724 --> 35:34.275
you would be the lip sync
assassin of your season,

35:34.344 --> 35:36.551
because you are no stranger
to bottoming weekly.

35:36.620 --> 35:38.620
-Ooh!

35:38.689 --> 35:42.379
But no, seriously, you are
the only man that I know

35:42.448 --> 35:45.034
that masturbates
to Lifetime movie network.

35:45.103 --> 35:46.517
Don't judge me!

35:46.586 --> 35:50.000
Angeria may not have
the punchlines,

35:50.068 --> 35:51.758
but she is delivering everything

35:51.827 --> 35:54.344
as if it is the funniest thing
you've ever heard.

35:54.413 --> 35:57.724
Jacking to soap operas
and shit.

35:57.793 --> 36:02.275
That is all the time
that I have for y'all today.

36:02.344 --> 36:04.172
Ladies and gentlemen,
Uncle Fester.

36:04.241 --> 36:07.655
-Aah!
-Yes!

36:10.137 --> 36:13.206
You know, I am terrified.

36:13.275 --> 36:15.448
I've never done a roast before,

36:15.517 --> 36:18.620
but Dulcé did give me
some really good advice

36:18.689 --> 36:20.137
before we got started.

36:20.206 --> 36:22.344
It's really all about
creating jokes

36:22.413 --> 36:25.413
centered around people
that you respect the most.

36:25.482 --> 36:28.137
I was, like, well, shit,
I'm definitely in trouble then.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.344
Although I don't really
consider myself

36:32.413 --> 36:34.448
the funniest girl here,

36:34.517 --> 36:37.862
I am very happy to be here
in front of you all tonight.

36:37.931 --> 36:41.655
I want you all to take a look
at Michelle Visage over here.

36:41.724 --> 36:45.620
Look at her beautiful hair,
the stunning makeup.

36:45.689 --> 36:50.034
Now, this is what a man in a wig
is supposed to look like, okay?

36:50.103 --> 36:52.448
Now, Ru, roasting you

36:52.517 --> 36:55.620
is probably the most
difficult thing, you know,

36:55.689 --> 36:57.827
just because
I admire you so much.

36:57.896 --> 36:59.413
I think you are
just so successful.

36:59.482 --> 37:02.965
Hell, you had a podcast
that always made people smile.

37:03.034 --> 37:10.310
Daya's taking so long
to get to every punchline.

37:10.379 --> 37:13.724
You have a TV show that
constantly makes people laugh.

37:13.793 --> 37:15.034
You have a music career

37:15.103 --> 37:20.206
that makes people go
uh-huh, okay, cool.

37:20.275 --> 37:21.482
It's like, oh, not only
wasn't it not funny,

37:21.551 --> 37:24.620
but you wasted my time.

37:24.689 --> 37:29.275
But, you know, we are all here
tonight for a reason.

37:29.344 --> 37:31.172
Ross, you are so gay

37:31.241 --> 37:33.275
your favorite candy is PrEP.

37:33.344 --> 37:37.896
And you know, you truly are
a staple of this show,

37:37.965 --> 37:43.068
and you are definitely one of my
top...four favorite judges here.

37:44.379 --> 37:47.586
Let me introduce you
to our next guest.

37:47.655 --> 37:48.862
She was conceived in a car

37:48.931 --> 37:50.793
going 80 miles per hour
down the interstate

37:50.862 --> 37:53.517
because that's where
most accidents happen.

37:53.586 --> 37:56.206
It's DeJa Skye!

37:56.275 --> 37:58.413
Well, hello, everybody.

37:58.482 --> 38:00.137
Give it up for Miss Daya Betty.

38:00.206 --> 38:01.551
Yeah!

38:01.620 --> 38:03.551
Now, I will say
Daya looks like

38:03.620 --> 38:05.379
what a five-year-old would draw

38:05.448 --> 38:08.241
if you asked them
to draw Bigfoot.

38:08.310 --> 38:11.413
Or a big foot.

38:11.482 --> 38:13.758
Yeah, that's very much
Daya Betty.

38:13.827 --> 38:16.172
Now, speaking of big things,

38:16.241 --> 38:20.586
what's the difference between
my padding and Bosco's big ego?

38:20.655 --> 38:22.137
Oh, my God.

38:22.206 --> 38:24.517
My padding can clear a doorway.

38:24.586 --> 38:26.689
Oh, my God.

38:26.758 --> 38:28.758
Just kidding.
Not really.

38:30.379 --> 38:32.793
Let's talk about you guys.

38:32.862 --> 38:35.724
Michelle, you are
a dirty, dirty woman,

38:35.793 --> 38:38.517
and I only say that because
she hasn't washed her vagina

38:38.586 --> 38:41.206
since Season 4
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

38:41.275 --> 38:42.310
-Oh, my God.
-Whew.

38:42.379 --> 38:44.275
Now, what's something nice

38:44.344 --> 38:45.758
that I can say about Michelle

38:45.827 --> 38:49.551
that already hasn't been said
by the L.A. Rams?

38:50.793 --> 38:54.310
Or the Clippers.
Or the Lakers.

38:54.379 --> 38:55.931
She's a whore.

38:57.758 --> 39:00.448
And that leads me
to the queen of the hour,

39:00.517 --> 39:02.758
Mrs. Ross Mathews.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.241
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bow!

39:04.310 --> 39:07.517
Now, Ross, I personally
love your voice,

39:07.586 --> 39:10.241
but sometimes
it gets so high-pitched

39:10.310 --> 39:13.586
I'm almost certain
only dogs can hear it.

39:13.655 --> 39:15.620
Woof! You know what I mean?

39:17.172 --> 39:21.586
Oh, no, DeJa.

39:21.655 --> 39:23.034
Now it's weird,
and I don't understand this,

39:23.103 --> 39:25.034
but I am in full drag,

39:25.103 --> 39:27.758
and for some reason I look
more masculine than you.

39:27.827 --> 39:29.068
I don't get it.

39:29.137 --> 39:30.551
It's the flannel.

39:33.172 --> 39:35.068
Tell another one.
I'm bombing up here.

39:35.137 --> 39:36.448
Hey.

39:36.517 --> 39:37.620
Well, my time is done.

39:37.689 --> 39:39.931
Let's introduce
our next entertainer.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.551
Now, this queen
needs no introduction.

39:49.482 --> 39:51.724
Finally a joke lands,

39:51.793 --> 39:53.103
and it happens to be
the last one.

39:55.931 --> 39:58.206
Hello, everyone!

39:58.275 --> 39:59.344
-Hello!
-Hello!

39:59.413 --> 40:01.344
Thank fuck
that was over. Yay-ya!

40:02.793 --> 40:04.724
The Muppets are here!

40:04.793 --> 40:07.275
Yes, a bunch of ugly monsters

40:07.344 --> 40:10.448
who only come to life when
there is a hand up their ass.

40:12.103 --> 40:13.482
I'm excited
for tonight's runway.

40:13.551 --> 40:17.068
Jorgeous will be wearing
a headband as a dress,

40:17.137 --> 40:20.103
and RuPaul will be telling her
that she is a superstar.

40:20.172 --> 40:22.758
Yes. Can't wait for you
to superstar your way

40:22.827 --> 40:24.034
out of this roast, bitch.
Damn.

40:24.103 --> 40:25.586
-Oh, my God!
-Enough about them.

40:25.655 --> 40:28.965
I am in front of gay
Mount Rushmore tonight. Yes.

40:29.034 --> 40:30.689
Knock, knock.

40:30.758 --> 40:31.896
Who's there?

40:31.965 --> 40:33.655
I don't know,
but Michelle's a whore.

40:36.344 --> 40:39.689
"Michelle" actually translates
to "beautiful,"

40:39.758 --> 40:42.482
and "Visage" translates
to "just kidding."

40:45.068 --> 40:46.551
-Hey, Ross.
-Hi!

40:46.620 --> 40:48.172
I'm sorry, my dear,

40:48.241 --> 40:50.379
but you represent the bottoms
and the bottoms of the week.

40:51.620 --> 40:54.310
Ross is a true
Hollywood success story,

40:54.379 --> 40:57.206
proof that you do not need
a deep voice.

40:57.275 --> 40:58.586
You just need a deep throat.

40:58.655 --> 40:59.965
Ooh!

41:00.034 --> 41:01.379
Ross, you are so gay

41:01.448 --> 41:03.482
that when I shout "hello"
into your asshole,

41:03.551 --> 41:06.655
it echoes,
"hello, hello, hello,"

41:06.724 --> 41:09.724
and then it comes back,
"Hey, bitch."

41:09.793 --> 41:12.275
Every time I shout,
"I need relationship advice"

41:12.344 --> 41:16.172
and it comes back out,
"Fucking dump him, bitch."

41:16.241 --> 41:19.275
Every time I shout
"What is the meaning of life"

41:19.344 --> 41:21.517
into Ross's asshole,
it echoes in

41:21.586 --> 41:23.965
and it comes back out,
"It's Britney, bitch."

41:24.034 --> 41:26.655
That's all
I have time for today.

41:26.724 --> 41:29.137
Thank you all so much,
and thank you for letting us

41:29.206 --> 41:31.413
destroy you completely tonight,
Ross Mathews.

41:31.482 --> 41:32.551
We adore you. Mwah.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.965
Thank you.

41:35.034 --> 41:38.965
Let's give a big round
of applause for Ross Mathews.

41:40.655 --> 41:43.172
I feel very loved.
Thank you.

41:43.241 --> 41:45.000
Is there anything
you wanna say?

41:45.068 --> 41:46.413
I quit.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.068
Coming up...

41:52.137 --> 41:54.103
You fucking smashed it.

41:54.172 --> 41:56.620
You sold it like
you were the headliner.

41:56.689 --> 41:58.965
You broke the fourth wall,
you broke the illusion.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.827
Category is Tutu Much.

42:12.896 --> 42:14.551
First up, Bosco.

42:14.620 --> 42:15.827
Michelle:
How's your head?

42:15.896 --> 42:19.931
Now, that's what
I call a shoulder blade.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.379
I'm giving you
buzz saw ballerina.

42:23.448 --> 42:26.172
I do a lot
of horror-based drag.

42:26.241 --> 42:29.034
It's kind of like
a fuck you to tutu

42:29.103 --> 42:31.137
while also putting
my own spin on it.

42:31.206 --> 42:33.965
Nice middle ground
of glamour and gore.

42:34.034 --> 42:35.517
Well, she saw it
in the store

42:35.586 --> 42:36.482
and just had to have it.

42:39.206 --> 42:41.103
Up next, Jorgeous.

42:41.172 --> 42:43.379
I hear she's got a part
in West Side Whorey.

42:45.344 --> 42:48.103
Rita Moren-ho.

42:48.172 --> 42:50.103
Jorgeous:
I'm showing the judges

42:50.172 --> 42:52.206
a little more
rougher side of Jorgeous,

42:52.275 --> 42:55.275
knowing that she can get butch
a little bit, you know.

42:55.344 --> 42:57.172
I feel so badass right now.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.862
Lesbian biker realness.

42:59.931 --> 43:01.517
You know,
the Village People

43:01.586 --> 43:04.482
have really changed
since I was a kid.

43:04.551 --> 43:06.482
Up next, Willow Pill.

43:06.551 --> 43:09.310
These are the lips
I dream of.

43:09.379 --> 43:11.517
Now, she's
a real filler queen.

43:11.586 --> 43:14.793
This look is inspired
by Donatella Versace,

43:14.862 --> 43:18.310
Amanda Lepore, Bjork,
Cruella de Vil.

43:18.379 --> 43:20.517
I'm having so much fun
with my little opera glasses,

43:20.586 --> 43:23.482
peering at the judges
and cackling at them,

43:23.551 --> 43:25.068
like, muahahaha.

43:25.137 --> 43:27.000
And I know this is what
Michelle wants to look like

43:27.068 --> 43:28.758
in about a hundred years.

43:28.827 --> 43:30.931
RuPaul:
Mary, Queen of Scats.

43:33.551 --> 43:37.620
Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

43:37.689 --> 43:39.827
Whose lime
is it anyway?

43:39.896 --> 43:42.655
She's not just wearing
a tutu, ladies and gentlemen,

43:42.724 --> 43:44.827
she is wearing a tutu gown,

43:44.896 --> 43:47.448
because you know I gotta do
my Angeria thing, honey.

43:47.517 --> 43:51.344
There are four layers
of tutus on my dress.

43:51.413 --> 43:54.827
I am tutu much for you,
and you cannot take it.

43:54.896 --> 43:56.310
Oh!

43:56.379 --> 43:58.517
She put the lime
in the coconut.

44:00.896 --> 44:02.448
Daya Betty.

44:02.517 --> 44:05.068
Hold me closer,
not-so-tiny dancer.

44:05.137 --> 44:06.931
Now, that
is what I call

44:07.000 --> 44:08.931
a tutu by four-four.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.241
This entire outfit

44:11.310 --> 44:13.758
is made
out of recycled materials.

44:13.827 --> 44:16.103
The jacket
is a thrifted jacket.

44:16.172 --> 44:20.965
The crown is a duct tape roll
covered in construction paper.

44:21.034 --> 44:23.620
I'm wearing
11-inch platform heels.

44:23.689 --> 44:27.275
This takes me
from 6-3 to 7-3.

44:27.344 --> 44:28.689
Well, 7-2
if you do the math correctly,

44:28.758 --> 44:29.965
but who's good at math?

44:30.034 --> 44:31.482
Ross:
Uh, my eyes are up here.

44:31.551 --> 44:34.827
No, no, keep going.
Up. Up here.

44:34.896 --> 44:36.517
DeJa Skye.

44:36.586 --> 44:38.758
This is pastel-oquent.

44:38.827 --> 44:41.241
Katy Perry's sister
Aqua Perry.

44:41.310 --> 44:43.275
I love pastel.

44:43.344 --> 44:45.137
It looks so good
on my melanated skin.

44:45.206 --> 44:48.758
I basically want to be like
if I had prom in Candy Land.

44:48.827 --> 44:50.965
I wanted to feel adorable.

44:51.034 --> 44:52.862
Simple, gorgeous dress.

44:52.931 --> 44:55.689
Now, this queen
is a really big teal.

44:57.827 --> 44:59.827
Lady Camden.

44:59.896 --> 45:02.896
Pas de,
oh, yes, she betta deux.

45:04.275 --> 45:05.689
Lady Camden:
How can I come here

45:05.758 --> 45:09.103
and not wear my dream tutu?

45:09.172 --> 45:10.275
The first time
I ever saw a ballet,

45:10.344 --> 45:11.586
everything that I saw

45:11.655 --> 45:13.448
was sparkling
like an absolute dream,

45:13.517 --> 45:16.068
and so I'm giving you
that full fantasy.

45:16.137 --> 45:18.862
Just floating down the runway,

45:18.931 --> 45:20.793
pushing stars into space,

45:20.862 --> 45:22.827
ballerina to the max.

45:22.896 --> 45:25.448
She's tutu legit
to tutu quit.

45:30.068 --> 45:31.068
Coming up...

45:31.137 --> 45:33.862
This look is just glamour.

45:33.931 --> 45:36.000
-Mmm, gimme.

45:36.068 --> 45:38.068
God didn't intend for anyone
to ever wear this color.

45:44.310 --> 45:46.172
Welcome, ladies.

45:46.241 --> 45:48.724
It's time for
the judges' critiques,

45:48.793 --> 45:51.413
starting with Bosco.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.689
Well, for starters, I hate
all you fucking bitches.

45:55.137 --> 45:56.655
No, listen, here's the deal.

45:56.724 --> 45:58.758
If you're gonna do a roast,
you've gotta go there.

45:58.827 --> 46:00.551
I mean, you crockpot me

46:00.620 --> 46:02.103
till my meat
is falling off the bone.

46:02.172 --> 46:03.137
That's what I want.

46:03.206 --> 46:04.310
Mmm!

46:04.379 --> 46:06.862
Bosco, not only did you have

46:06.931 --> 46:08.827
a strong stage presence
out there,

46:08.896 --> 46:11.931
you also knew
the structure of a joke:

46:12.000 --> 46:13.482
setup, punchline.

46:13.551 --> 46:16.103
You took all of the notes
that me and Michelle gave you,

46:16.172 --> 46:18.482
and you applied them very well.

46:18.551 --> 46:21.000
And you fucking smashed it.

46:21.068 --> 46:22.344
Thank you.

46:22.413 --> 46:24.206
This outfit,
I absolutely love it.

46:24.275 --> 46:27.034
The split in the hair
with the curl, Miss Ma'am.

46:28.655 --> 46:31.137
There's a concept,
and it's fun and it's edgy.

46:31.206 --> 46:32.413
Very cutting edge look.

46:33.793 --> 46:35.413
Good night for you.
You were very funny.

46:35.482 --> 46:36.724
-Very good.
-Thank you.

46:36.793 --> 46:39.689
Up next, it's Jorgeous.

46:39.758 --> 46:41.965
This is really fun,
it's really edgy,

46:42.034 --> 46:43.206
very kind of early Madonna.

46:43.275 --> 46:44.689
I could see her in that.

46:44.758 --> 46:47.482
I think you struggled
a little bit in the roast.

46:47.551 --> 46:50.655
It just felt like you never
really got your footing.

46:50.724 --> 46:53.551
In rehearsal,
you looked defeated,

46:53.620 --> 46:55.379
like you just wanted to give up,

46:55.448 --> 46:57.344
and we didn't want you
to give up.

46:57.413 --> 47:01.068
So your delivery was good,
but you pulled back.

47:01.137 --> 47:03.000
When you come up here,
you're talking to us

47:03.068 --> 47:05.034
like you're kiki-ing
with any of your homegirls.

47:05.103 --> 47:07.034
I don't think you were able
to connect that.

47:07.103 --> 47:09.172
Did you have fun doing it?

47:09.241 --> 47:11.586
Honestly, I did not have fun
whatsoever doing it.

47:11.655 --> 47:13.103
Aw!

47:13.172 --> 47:14.310
Yeah, yeah.

47:14.379 --> 47:15.862
It was like when Bosco
introduced me,

47:15.931 --> 47:17.896
like, I was already about
to, like, burst out in tears.

47:17.965 --> 47:20.793
Yeah. Well, it should have
been fun, because at one point,

47:20.862 --> 47:25.206
you realize that you
can't take life too seriously.

47:25.275 --> 47:26.517
You know, have fun with it.

47:26.586 --> 47:28.689
Anyway, thank you.

47:28.758 --> 47:29.758
Thank you.

47:29.827 --> 47:32.000
Up next, it's Willow Pill,

47:32.068 --> 47:35.758
and she has never looked
more beautiful.

47:35.827 --> 47:37.275
You came out really strong
in the roast,

47:37.344 --> 47:38.827
and I was laughing right away.

47:38.896 --> 47:41.586
I love how you think,
and that was on display.

47:41.655 --> 47:43.103
Of course,
you could have gone further.

47:43.172 --> 47:45.862
You know, I really want you
to give it to me.

47:45.931 --> 47:48.275
This, however, delicious.

47:48.344 --> 47:50.482
This is, like, Pete Burns,
rest in peace.

47:50.551 --> 47:53.206
Everything about it
is just glamorous.

47:53.275 --> 47:56.448
Just a fabulous look.
Oh, my goodness.

47:56.517 --> 47:59.241
In the roast, did you have fun?
Did you laugh at yourself?

47:59.310 --> 48:02.275
I was terrified, because
I'm not really, like,

48:02.344 --> 48:04.034
a ba-dum-tchh kind of comedian.

48:04.103 --> 48:05.206
Yeah.

48:05.275 --> 48:06.724
It's hard to speak
in these lips.

48:07.793 --> 48:10.620
Up next, Angeria.

48:10.689 --> 48:13.620
What I loved about your roast
was your confidence.

48:13.689 --> 48:15.241
Were you the funniest queen? No.

48:15.310 --> 48:18.000
But you sold it like
you were the headliner.

48:18.068 --> 48:23.000
And when your jokes didn't hit,
it only was for a second,

48:23.068 --> 48:24.758
and you were just like,
okay, next.

48:24.827 --> 48:26.655
There are comics
that cannot do that.

48:26.724 --> 48:29.241
For this look, mm, gimme.

48:31.344 --> 48:33.068
Do you know why
I love this color?

48:33.137 --> 48:34.137
Why?

48:34.206 --> 48:35.241
Because God didn't intend

48:35.310 --> 48:37.034
for anyone
to ever wear this color.

48:39.068 --> 48:40.517
Which takes it to drag.

48:40.586 --> 48:43.793
I love an unnatural color.

48:44.862 --> 48:46.103
I'm stealing that wig.

48:46.172 --> 48:47.482
Just come to Atlanta and get it.

48:47.551 --> 48:49.413
Oh, girl, I know you
got that wig from Atlanta.

48:49.482 --> 48:50.793
Imma go to my mama house
and get it.

48:52.793 --> 48:55.275
All right, up next,
it's Daya Betty.

48:55.344 --> 48:57.413
Listen, I like this because

48:57.482 --> 49:00.034
sometimes when people wanna
do distressed, they go too far.

49:00.103 --> 49:01.206
Yeah.

49:01.275 --> 49:03.344
And this is just,
hey, listen,

49:03.413 --> 49:05.206
I'm in the ballet.

49:05.275 --> 49:08.275
I got a good job,
but also, I got the tights on.

49:08.344 --> 49:09.517
Are there holes in 'em?

49:09.586 --> 49:10.965
You gonna gimme my check.

49:11.034 --> 49:13.000
I came to work,
stop playing with me.

49:13.068 --> 49:14.000
I understand this girl.

49:14.068 --> 49:15.413
You know how I could tell

49:15.482 --> 49:16.793
that you were a little nervous
during the roast?

49:16.862 --> 49:18.275
How?

49:18.344 --> 49:20.482
First thing you said
was, "I'm nervous."

49:20.551 --> 49:22.827
Yeah.

49:22.896 --> 49:25.724
I just wasn't on board
from the get-go

49:25.793 --> 49:27.103
because you told me not to be.

49:27.172 --> 49:29.413
Did I stop you and say,

49:29.482 --> 49:31.034
"Don't tell me
what you don't have.

49:31.103 --> 49:32.724
-Tell me what you do have?"
-You did.

49:32.793 --> 49:34.241
So when you said
you're nervous,

49:34.310 --> 49:36.517
you broke the fourth wall,
you broke the illusion.

49:36.586 --> 49:39.448
I think tonight you got lost.

49:39.517 --> 49:42.655
I think the jokes
were way too long.

49:42.724 --> 49:45.034
Looked great.
Delivery, not so great.

49:45.103 --> 49:47.275
I was trying so hard
not to get nervous.

49:47.344 --> 49:49.689
Like, I was really trying
to, like, slow down.

49:49.758 --> 49:51.241
I have a tendency to talk
really fast sometimes, so--

49:51.310 --> 49:53.206
Yeah, yeah.

49:53.275 --> 49:56.137
It's interesting when you
second guess what's the obvious.

49:56.206 --> 49:57.793
Be a star, you know?

49:57.862 --> 49:59.448
-Okay. Yeah.
-You know?

49:59.517 --> 50:01.379
-All right, thanks.
-Thank you guys.

50:01.448 --> 50:03.862
Up next, DeJa Skye.

50:03.931 --> 50:07.586
Tonight, I think from here up,
you look so beautiful.

50:07.655 --> 50:09.862
I think the fit of this dress
is where I'm having a problem.

50:09.931 --> 50:11.586
The top is very kind of--

50:11.655 --> 50:12.931
-Weird, yeah.
-Yeah.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.068
It just looks like
it's falling off up here.

50:14.137 --> 50:16.793
-Let's talk about the roast.
-Okay.

50:16.862 --> 50:19.103
The issue was
when you roast somebody,

50:19.172 --> 50:22.689
you've gotta tell the truth
and then put the spin on it.

50:22.758 --> 50:25.344
What you just gave us
were kind of facts.

50:25.413 --> 50:28.241
My voice is so high-pitched
a dog can hear it. Fact.

50:28.310 --> 50:29.413
And so I was waiting
for the twist.

50:29.482 --> 50:31.103
So you could have gone

50:31.172 --> 50:32.482
Ross Mathews' voice is so high,

50:32.551 --> 50:35.344
he makes Paul Lynde
sound like Morgan Freeman.

50:37.413 --> 50:39.310
It felt like you didn't take
any of me and Michelle's notes,

50:39.379 --> 50:42.827
and me and Michelle
didn't get dressed

50:42.896 --> 50:44.965
just to not have
somebody listen to us,

50:45.034 --> 50:46.206
because we came
to help you, girl.

50:46.275 --> 50:48.965
We told you what to do,
what to work on,

50:49.034 --> 50:51.586
and you did the ones
we told you not to do,

50:51.655 --> 50:52.931
and they didn't land.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.793
I did add a joke
that you Xed out

50:54.862 --> 50:56.896
just because
I really kind of liked it.

50:56.965 --> 50:59.000
But even your opening joke,
we said mm-mm,

50:59.068 --> 51:00.793
and you opened with it anyway.

51:00.862 --> 51:02.896
Right.
I'm not, like, a comedian.

51:02.965 --> 51:05.068
I don't consider myself
a comedian.

51:05.137 --> 51:08.172
Yeah, but we're all
kind of clowns, you know.

51:08.241 --> 51:10.206
Do you have things that
you say in your nightclub act

51:10.275 --> 51:12.068
or when you're hosting?

51:12.137 --> 51:15.034
Oh, yeah. I love saying, like,
gay boys, can I get a yes?

51:15.103 --> 51:17.793
And then I do this thing.
I'll say, like,

51:17.862 --> 51:20.344
let me feminize my voice
for this one.

51:20.413 --> 51:21.551
Where are all
my straight boys at?

51:23.034 --> 51:25.103
And so it just--
okay, great.

51:25.172 --> 51:28.275
Yeah. Yeah.

51:28.344 --> 51:31.413
All right, thank you.
Up next, Lady Camden.

51:31.482 --> 51:33.551
You started so strong
with the roast,

51:33.620 --> 51:36.344
I was really on board with you
from the get-go.

51:36.413 --> 51:39.206
Your delivery,
the way you looked was great.

51:39.275 --> 51:41.344
I did really enjoy your set.

51:41.413 --> 51:44.551
You did have just those little
cheeky moments that I did like.

51:44.620 --> 51:46.448
But that asshole echo.

51:47.758 --> 51:48.965
You know that joke didn't work.

51:49.034 --> 51:52.344
But tonight,
this look is just glamour.

51:52.413 --> 51:54.655
I was so hoping
that you'd give us

51:54.724 --> 51:56.172
the full ballerina fantasy
tonight.

51:56.241 --> 51:58.344
-Oh, good.
-Especially when it was tutu.

51:58.413 --> 52:00.551
I love that
you didn't do ballet hair.

52:00.620 --> 52:04.586
You gave us glamour hair,
and it just makes it drag.

52:04.655 --> 52:08.103
And the appliqué on your skin
is so stunning.

52:08.172 --> 52:12.034
I think you had a really
strong night tonight, Camden.

52:12.103 --> 52:14.931
Listen, I'm just gonna echo
everything everyone else said.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.689
Oh, echo. Sorry.

52:16.758 --> 52:18.000
Too soon?

52:18.068 --> 52:19.448
It's probably too soon, yeah.

52:19.517 --> 52:20.862
-Too soon.
-You look beautiful.

52:20.931 --> 52:23.137
Thank you so much.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.206
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

52:25.275 --> 52:27.827
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

52:27.896 --> 52:29.862
the judges and I
will deliberate.

52:31.344 --> 52:35.551
We are getting down to it
in this compe--what?--tition.

52:35.620 --> 52:37.724
Now, just between
us squirrel friends,

52:37.793 --> 52:39.344
let's start with Bosco.

52:39.413 --> 52:41.931
Well, she came out tonight,
and she slayed the house down.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.620
And this from a queen

52:43.689 --> 52:44.896
who, if it weren't
for a golden candy bar,

52:44.965 --> 52:46.000
wouldn't even be here
this week.

52:46.068 --> 52:47.000
-That's right.
-Fact.

52:47.068 --> 52:48.655
-Right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

52:48.724 --> 52:52.034
So I love a story of someone
who rises from the ashes.

52:52.103 --> 52:53.827
Strong night for Bosco.

52:53.896 --> 52:55.379
Jorgeous.

52:55.448 --> 52:57.344
Before she even opened
her mouth, she was defeated,

52:57.413 --> 52:58.586
and she brought us down
with her.

52:58.655 --> 52:59.620
It was uncomfortable.

52:59.689 --> 53:01.655
She is a humongous star.

53:01.724 --> 53:03.517
-Mm-hmm.
-The sky is the limit for her.

53:03.586 --> 53:04.965
But in this competition,

53:05.034 --> 53:08.793
you have to have every skill set
to make it to the end.

53:08.862 --> 53:10.793
-Willow Pill.
-Ooh, baby.

53:10.862 --> 53:13.482
Can we talk about that runway
for two hot seconds?

53:13.551 --> 53:15.724
The lips.
Did I get 'em? No.

53:15.793 --> 53:17.862
Do I want 'em? Yes.

53:19.344 --> 53:21.034
I love that extreme look.

53:21.103 --> 53:23.103
It may be my favorite look
of the evening.

53:23.172 --> 53:24.551
I thought her comedy
was good enough

53:24.620 --> 53:26.620
to give us some strong laughs
in there.

53:26.689 --> 53:28.103
I love Willow,

53:28.172 --> 53:30.482
and not just because she
called me a handsome lesbian.

53:30.551 --> 53:34.206
I just think
she is so interesting.

53:34.275 --> 53:35.206
Angeria.

53:35.275 --> 53:36.689
She came into that rehearsal,

53:36.758 --> 53:40.000
and she was convinced
that her jokes were hilarious.

53:40.068 --> 53:42.344
They weren't.

53:42.413 --> 53:44.206
I laughed at Angeria's jokes,

53:44.275 --> 53:46.103
even though
they weren't that funny.

53:46.172 --> 53:48.241
I love when somebody laughs
at their own jokes,

53:48.310 --> 53:50.379
because when they do that,
it sucks us in.

53:50.448 --> 53:51.931
She was selling the jokes.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.827
Even the ones that didn't land,
I still wanted to hear 'em.

53:54.896 --> 53:55.965
Daya Betty.

53:56.034 --> 53:57.551
On the opposite end
of the spectrum,

53:57.620 --> 53:58.758
Daya Betty said straightaway
she was nervous,

53:58.827 --> 53:59.931
and then we were like,
oh, dear.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
And then it kind of
went nowhere.

54:02.068 --> 54:03.586
-Yeah.
-She could have sold it.

54:03.655 --> 54:05.413
I never would have thought in
a million years she was nervous.

54:05.482 --> 54:07.793
Because Daya Betty
in Daytona Wind,

54:07.862 --> 54:10.241
she was a rock star.

54:10.310 --> 54:11.793
She came out defeated,

54:11.862 --> 54:14.103
and it showed, unfortunately,
in this challenge tonight.

54:14.172 --> 54:16.379
DeJa Skye.

54:16.448 --> 54:17.827
When DeJa walked out,

54:17.896 --> 54:21.034
she was giving drag
early Roseanne, Brett Butler,

54:21.103 --> 54:22.379
and she didn't deliver.

54:22.448 --> 54:24.620
She had specific jokes
that she wanted to do,

54:24.689 --> 54:27.241
and Dulcé and I were like, no,
that actually is not funny.

54:27.310 --> 54:28.482
Get rid of it.

54:28.551 --> 54:30.482
-She did all those jokes.

54:30.551 --> 54:31.931
Yeah.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.379
On the runway, this
didn't work for me, either.

54:33.448 --> 54:35.586
I got tulle.
I got no tutu from that.

54:35.655 --> 54:39.034
Yeah, the prom dress
that doesn't fit.

54:39.103 --> 54:41.551
It wouldn't have taken much
to just take in that top.

54:41.620 --> 54:43.172
Clip it.
We all got clamps on.

54:43.241 --> 54:44.827
Yeah, I wouldn't have a career
without a clamp.

54:44.896 --> 54:46.344
Mm, I'm clamping right now.

54:48.206 --> 54:49.827
Lady Camden.

54:49.896 --> 54:51.827
The roast, she took the notes,
she did it.

54:51.896 --> 54:53.655
She had a strong set,

54:53.724 --> 54:55.965
but oddly, the one that we were
trying to work out with her,

54:56.034 --> 54:57.275
the echo joke,

54:57.344 --> 54:59.793
we not only told her
that it wasn't funny,

54:59.862 --> 55:03.275
but she decided
to add two more goes of it.

55:04.517 --> 55:05.482
She was determined
to yell "hello"

55:05.551 --> 55:07.137
into Ross Mathews' asshole.

55:07.206 --> 55:09.206
I kind of didn't mind,

55:09.275 --> 55:13.137
because she's just got
this delivery that's so smooth.

55:13.206 --> 55:17.172
She is a queen who has
every skill it takes

55:17.241 --> 55:19.551
to find herself in the end
of this competition.

55:19.620 --> 55:21.034
All right, silence.

55:22.068 --> 55:24.137
I've made my decision.

55:24.206 --> 55:25.413
Bring back my girls.

55:25.482 --> 55:26.620
...irls, irls.

55:26.689 --> 55:28.000
Girls, girl.

55:28.068 --> 55:29.931
Girls, girlth. Girls.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.827
My butthole.

55:38.310 --> 55:40.448
Welcome back, ladies.

55:40.517 --> 55:42.172
I've made some decisions.

55:45.689 --> 55:47.965
Lady Camden.

55:48.034 --> 55:50.310
You're safe,
you're safe, you're safe.

55:50.379 --> 55:53.896
Bitch.

55:53.965 --> 55:56.172
You may step
to the back of the stage.

55:57.965 --> 55:59.275
Bosco.

55:59.344 --> 56:00.724
Tonight you really cut through.

56:02.275 --> 56:03.724
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

56:06.068 --> 56:08.827
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.

56:08.896 --> 56:10.275
Oh.

56:10.344 --> 56:13.068
I was essentially told
to go home last week,

56:13.137 --> 56:16.827
and I come back
and I knock it out of the park

56:16.896 --> 56:20.862
and I feel like
a fucking rock star.

56:23.827 --> 56:24.827
Willow Pill.

56:26.482 --> 56:27.482
You're safe.

56:28.965 --> 56:32.034
Angeria Paris VanMicheals.

56:32.103 --> 56:34.000
You're safe.

56:34.068 --> 56:35.448
Thank you.

56:37.413 --> 56:39.172
Daya Betty.

56:39.241 --> 56:41.724
You are a towering talent,

56:41.793 --> 56:44.931
but in the roast,
you came up short.

56:46.413 --> 56:47.931
Jorgeous.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.965
You're one tender queen,

56:51.034 --> 56:53.586
but your roast was tough.

56:55.241 --> 56:57.241
DeJa Skye.

56:57.310 --> 56:59.206
You're a queen
with a lot of flavor,

56:59.275 --> 57:03.241
but your roast made me
wanna order a pizza.

57:06.689 --> 57:10.620
I'm sorry, my dears,
but all three of you

57:10.689 --> 57:13.931
are up for elimination.

57:16.586 --> 57:17.551
Holy shit.

57:17.620 --> 57:21.068
Three queens stand before me.

57:22.862 --> 57:26.172
In a moment, I'll ask
one of you to shantay

57:26.241 --> 57:28.034
and two of you...

57:30.931 --> 57:32.068
Fuck.

57:32.137 --> 57:33.655
...to sashay away.

57:37.724 --> 57:41.655
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

57:41.724 --> 57:45.655
and save yourself
from elimination.

57:47.517 --> 57:49.793
The time has come...

57:49.862 --> 57:52.379
for you to lip sync...

57:52.448 --> 57:54.793
for your life!

57:57.517 --> 57:59.000
There's some moments
where I'm, like, fuck.

57:59.068 --> 58:00.896
Like, I can't do this
no more, you know?

58:00.965 --> 58:04.517
But, like, this is what I do,
and Imma turn it.

58:04.586 --> 58:10.206
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

59:27.931 --> 59:29.551
The song's about
being pissed off,

59:29.620 --> 59:31.965
so I can really tap into that.

59:32.034 --> 59:35.103
Survival is the only option
at this point.

59:39.689 --> 59:42.103
I am the only person
in this competition

59:42.172 --> 59:45.034
that has been told that
I am the lip sync assassin.

59:45.103 --> 59:46.172
So don't get it twisted,
bitches.

59:46.241 --> 59:48.724
I can lip sync the house down.

1:00:13.241 --> 1:00:16.172
Love you guys.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.413
Ladies, I've made my decision.

1:00:29.965 --> 1:00:32.103
Daya Betty, shantay you stay.

1:00:32.172 --> 1:00:34.172
Oh, my God.

1:00:34.241 --> 1:00:35.310
Congrats, sister.

1:00:35.379 --> 1:00:37.413
You better do it, bitch.

1:00:37.482 --> 1:00:39.413
Thank you, guys.

1:00:39.482 --> 1:00:43.379
I am gonna keep doing what
I've been doing from week one.

1:00:43.448 --> 1:00:46.310
I'm going to bounce back
and get to the top.

1:00:47.965 --> 1:00:49.103
Jorgeous.

1:00:49.172 --> 1:00:51.172
DeJa Skye.

1:00:51.241 --> 1:00:55.724
Your dragtastic journey
has only just begun.

1:00:55.793 --> 1:00:57.551
I love you so much.
Thank you for everything.

1:00:57.620 --> 1:00:58.655
Thank you.

1:00:58.724 --> 1:01:00.172
And thank you guys so much.

1:01:00.241 --> 1:01:01.448
I really do appreciate it.

1:01:01.517 --> 1:01:02.620
Thank you.

1:01:02.689 --> 1:01:05.344
Now sashay away.

1:01:05.413 --> 1:01:07.862
-Aow!
-Aow!

1:01:07.931 --> 1:01:09.344
Love you, guys.

1:01:09.413 --> 1:01:11.482
-I love y'all so much.
-Love you.

1:01:11.551 --> 1:01:12.931
Bitches, you have the power

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.931
to do whatever
y'all wanna do, and...

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.137
Remember to embrace the curve.

1:01:18.206 --> 1:01:19.448
I'll see you at the buffet.

1:01:19.517 --> 1:01:21.448
Goodbyeteous!

1:01:21.517 --> 1:01:23.896
-I love you!
-Love you!

1:01:23.965 --> 1:01:27.413
-Sister.
-Sister friend.

1:01:27.482 --> 1:01:30.310
I always say será, será,
whatever's for me is for me,

1:01:30.379 --> 1:01:32.896
and I faltered tonight.

1:01:32.965 --> 1:01:35.655
RuPaul, thank you so much
for believing in me,

1:01:35.724 --> 1:01:39.206
and honestly, the first thing
that I do when I get home,

1:01:39.275 --> 1:01:42.620
I'm gonna smoke a fat-ass blunt.

1:01:43.965 --> 1:01:45.448
Let's hit it!

1:01:46.862 --> 1:01:49.655
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:49.724 --> 1:01:52.137
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:52.206 --> 1:01:54.103
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:54.172 --> 1:01:55.482
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1:01:55.551 --> 1:01:56.586
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:56.655 --> 1:01:58.793
All right.
Now let the music play.

1:02:12.172 --> 1:02:14.172
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:02:14.241 --> 1:02:17.758
You'll be starring
in the music video Catwalk.

1:02:17.827 --> 1:02:20.965
Everybody is gunning
for that top four,

1:02:21.034 --> 1:02:23.551
so it's like, girl, you might
not wanna fuck this up.

1:02:23.620 --> 1:02:27.965
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.103
I need a diaper.
