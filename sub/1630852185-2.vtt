WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.505
And now, he's on the tube,
in the supermarket...

00:04.588 --> 00:05.423
He's following me.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.882
-But not really.
-[Alex] No, not really.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.676
-[gasps]
-[Ed] Oh, no!

00:08.759 --> 00:10.344
I was just trying to catch someone.
Did you see him?

00:10.428 --> 00:11.512
No, I didn't see anyone.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.389
-So how much longer is this gonna take?
-It will be very soon.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.474
-I'm Sabina, by the way.
-I'm Alex.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.143
[Alex] So what's your dad's book about?

00:17.226 --> 00:18.060
[Sabina] Damian Cray.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.937
The Feathered Serpent guy?

00:23.733 --> 00:24.734
Dad.

00:25.943 --> 00:30.239
[PC Elsom] Alex, no more stories about
bombs or men with scars. Just the truth.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.408
His name is Yassen Gregorovich.

00:32.491 --> 00:33.701
You need to find him.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.953
As long as he's around,
none of us are safe.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.204
Call this number.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.206
[operator] The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.624
Hey, Mrs. Jones.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.339
-What's that?
-Nothing.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.598
-[distorted audio]
-[ominous music playing]

00:58.893 --> 01:01.103
[Brixham] What I do want,
and I wanna be clear about this,

01:01.187 --> 01:03.481
I want a satellite retask
for the next window.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.567
[continues indistinct]

01:08.319 --> 01:11.947
Hey. Can you patch me through to the PFPA?

01:12.990 --> 01:16.118
Yeah. I'm getting some timing errors
in the main comms channel

01:16.202 --> 01:19.079
that are slowing our transfer down.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.539
I'm trying to run it down.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.210
[computer beeping]

01:24.293 --> 01:25.294
Hold that.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.713
[computer beeping rapidly]

01:27.797 --> 01:29.131
I've got a spike here.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.593
-What?
-[Clacy] No way.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.054
No way.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.514
[alarm blaring]

01:37.973 --> 01:40.142
-What is it?
-We kicked to backup.

01:40.226 --> 01:43.521
-What, is it a power failure?
-No, it was deliberate.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.689
Looks like it was external.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.526
Well, that's impossible. We're bunkered.

01:48.609 --> 01:49.819
I've got activity.

01:49.902 --> 01:52.613
-What system?
-STRATCOM.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.490
Nuclear launch command.

01:54.573 --> 01:55.658
Cut the satellite.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.784
Now!

01:56.867 --> 01:59.036
It's not on the satellite anymore.
It's on the fiber link.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.249
[technician 1] We're losing
system control. We've got 20 seconds.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.625
[Brixham] It's a hack!

02:04.708 --> 02:05.668
Shut us down!

02:05.751 --> 02:06.836
[alarm blaring]

02:06.919 --> 02:10.005
-[technician 1] Fifteen seconds, sir.
-Nonresponsive on this terminal.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.882
-I'm locked out.
-Nothing here.

02:11.966 --> 02:15.386
-I've lost control.
-Did you try the override?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.096
[technician 2] Ten seconds!

02:18.347 --> 02:22.059
This is Brixham. Duty code
delta-four-niner-zero-bravo-delta.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.272
Request hard shutdown of the Ops Room,
all portals, effective immediately!

02:28.482 --> 02:30.192
[technician 2] Five seconds!

02:37.157 --> 02:38.242
[sighs]

02:38.325 --> 02:40.953
Shit.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.539
How close a call was this?

02:43.622 --> 02:45.749
Miss Byrne, I appreciate the interest,

02:45.833 --> 02:49.920
and I know every new deputy director
needs to look busy,

02:50.004 --> 02:52.298
but it was a cyberattack.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.049
We shut it down.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.010
We have this under control.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.221
We don't need the CIA's assistance.

02:59.305 --> 03:02.182
I think it's best for both of us
if I make that decision, Colonel.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.142
How close?

03:04.101 --> 03:06.228
Another five seconds,

03:06.312 --> 03:10.524
and we would have lost control
of our nuclear launch codes.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.529
I may be a new face, Colonel,

03:15.613 --> 03:17.823
but I was brought in
because I'm quick on the uptake,

03:17.907 --> 03:20.284
so let me save you some time right here.

03:21.076 --> 03:24.246
You do need our help,
and you need it badly.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.707
-Do we know who it was?
-Not yet.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.876
But we believe
we've traced a point of origin

03:28.959 --> 03:32.004
-for the hack.
-Moscow or Beijing?

03:33.297 --> 03:34.798
London.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.134
[theme music playing]

04:31.021 --> 04:32.523
Alan.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.776
-Jo. Very good to meet you.
-Mrs. Jones.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.905
-To what do we owe the pleasure?
-Someone tried to hack the Pentagon.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.283
Why don't you come inside?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.664
What you're seeing
is the Pentagon NMCC ops room.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.542
-[Clacy] We got a spike here. No way.
-This was six months ago.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.753
[Blunt] And the Einstein detection system
didn't register this as an attack?

04:54.837 --> 04:57.047
Didn't blink an eye. This was very good.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.967
-And what was the target?
-Strategic Command.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.593
The nuclear codes?

05:02.177 --> 05:05.889
The ops commander saw what was happening
and pulled the plug, but it was close.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.474
How close?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.854
Five more seconds,
and they'd have succeeded.

05:13.981 --> 05:18.444
We worked out pretty quickly
that the origin was here in London.

05:23.490 --> 05:27.953
Our forensic data specialists
went through the logs of the attack.

05:28.037 --> 05:29.705
We believe it's the work
of one particular hacker.

05:29.788 --> 05:34.293
We have no real-world ID on this guy,

05:34.376 --> 05:37.463
but he was active on some
dark web forums a few years back.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.382
Some of his early posts
include examples of code,

05:40.466 --> 05:43.343
which is how we get a handle
on his style of programming.

05:43.427 --> 05:47.139
And there are fingerprints in the code
of the Pentagon attack that tie it to him.

05:47.222 --> 05:50.100
And it took you six months
to think of giving us a call?

05:50.893 --> 05:54.563
The trail went cold, until now.

05:54.646 --> 05:58.317
He recently popped up his head
for a minute, accessed some old files.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.778
We think he's still here.
We need to find him.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.113
And this is your town.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.991
Do you have anything for us
that we can use?

06:06.575 --> 06:10.913
He calls himself Smoking Mirror.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.458
[ominous music playing]

06:15.209 --> 06:17.127
-Can I get one of these newspapers?
-Sure.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.713
It's 6p, mate.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.300
-[man] Cheers, mate.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.261
[man] Hey.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.138
Are you gonna pay for that?

06:31.558 --> 06:32.726
[coins clinking]

06:43.695 --> 06:47.908
[Ed] So what's your name?
I can't keep calling you Smoking Mirror.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.787
Who are you working for?

06:51.870 --> 06:54.832
I'm not working for anybody.
I'm a journalist, I told you.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.042
I know your reputation.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.503
I know who you are.

06:59.586 --> 07:04.174
And I also know that you were hired
to do a job, a really big job.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.425
But the strange thing is,

07:05.509 --> 07:09.513
there's a rumor out there on the dark web
that the Pentagon got hacked.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.058
It would have taken someone
of considerable skill to pull that off.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.726
I was thinking maybe that was you.

07:14.810 --> 07:17.896
But what I don't understand is,
the people who hired you,

07:17.980 --> 07:20.274
why would they target the Pentagon?

07:20.357 --> 07:23.527
-Come on. Talk to me.
-I can't talk to you.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.821
Yes, you can. That's why you're here.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.156
-No.
-Then why'd you come?

07:27.239 --> 07:30.284
To warn you. You don't know
what these people are like.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.369
If you keep asking questions,
they'll know.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.580
And they'll find you,
and they'll kill you.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.915
And then they'll come for me too,
whether I talked to you or not.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.418
And I don't wanna die.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.045
Trust me.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.132
-Leave this alone.
-[dramatic music playing]

07:57.102 --> 07:59.271
Alex? I wasn't expecting you.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.981
I don't think
we have an appointment today.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.566
I need to talk to you.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.987
That's not how this works.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.114
I want to speak to Mrs. Jones.

08:09.198 --> 08:12.326
I don't have the contact information
for Mrs. Jones.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.495
Not for any of the government departments
who refer clients to me.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.788
It's part of the agreement.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.792
It protects you and your confidentiality.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.629
-So how do you get in touch with her?
-I don't.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.547
She doesn't even call me.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.299
So how do you get paid?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.509
Bank transfer.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.929
What did you think?

08:32.512 --> 08:37.017
A suitcase full of used notes
under a bridge at midnight?

08:37.100 --> 08:40.479
You don't need to talk to Mrs. Jones.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.023
You need to talk to me.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.652
But when we have
our scheduled appointment.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.531
-Okay?
-Sorry, but I don't think you can help me.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.078
Thanks anyway.

[pensive music playing]

[keypad beeping]

09:18.517 --> 09:19.476
It's me.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.729
Alex Rider was here a moment ago.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.440
No.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.068
If anything, it's getting worse.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.576
-Hey.
-Hello.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.705
-So how was Cornwall?
-It was memorable.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.581
-Did it rain?
-No.

09:41.665 --> 09:45.460
-Mm. That is memorable.
-So did I miss any important legal stuff?

09:45.544 --> 09:48.005
We had a briefing
on the Home Office rulings.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.381
The right to remain.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.883
A fresh opinion has come in from counsel.

09:51.967 --> 09:55.178
-I should have been here.
-You had to look after your...

09:55.971 --> 09:57.973
What is he exactly, your nephew?

09:58.056 --> 10:01.935
We're not related. We're just close.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.231
Well, you were missed.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.402
I took notes, lots of notes.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.531
It's pretty much all here.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.283
Thanks, Dan.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.202
I owe you for this.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.829
I might hold you to that.

Where the devil should this Romeo be?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.670
Came he not home tonight?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.881
Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.

that he runs mad.

-Sorry. Sorry.

if you don't learn your lines.

-They're kind of a blur.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.990
I mean, nothing they do makes any sense.

and we could read some pages.

They've moved her dad
to a private hospital in London.

where they deal with coma patients.

He's in a room, right?

he'd be the easiest target in the world.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.569
Runs like a lunatic.

13:41.404 --> 13:45.534
We're going to get something at the café.
Be right back.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.411
I'll see you soon, okay?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.881
[door opens and closes]

14:00.465 --> 14:02.926
What was your dad working on?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.929
-Alex...
-I know.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.472
It was a gas leak.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.392
But suppose it wasn't.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.188
There wasn't any gas, was there?

14:15.272 --> 14:17.232
I mean, we would have smelled it.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.944
You said your dad was writing a book
about the Feathered Serpent guy.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.988
-Damian Cray.
-Mm-hmm.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.117
But nobody gets hurt
because of a video game.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.494
Yeah,
but your dad was a journalist, right?

14:31.454 --> 14:32.581
There must have been other stories.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.586
He never told me.
He never talked about his work.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.547
He didn't want me to interfere.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.882
Or maybe he was trying to protect you.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.436
Are you gonna stay with your dad?

14:54.519 --> 14:56.187
Yeah, for a while.

14:57.522 --> 15:02.319
I think maybe someone should,
all the time.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.195
Why?

15:04.279 --> 15:05.447
Just to be sure.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.241
Stop it.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.370
You're scaring me.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.247
[Alex] Hey!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.667
What are you doing?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.169
-Hey!
-[dramatic music playing]

15:19.252 --> 15:21.463
[Sabina] Alex, what's going on?

15:40.106 --> 15:40.940
[beeps]

15:48.657 --> 15:50.533
[birds squawking]

15:50.617 --> 15:52.577
[Jones] What do we know
about this computer hacker?

15:53.161 --> 15:56.581
That he's very paranoid and very clever.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.002
These are the codes
from the Pentagon hack.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.922
Now, there are all sorts of ways
to write code.

16:04.005 --> 16:07.842
Some are obvious. Some aren't.

16:08.510 --> 16:09.344
[clicks key]

16:10.929 --> 16:12.764
Throw a technical problem
at ten programmers,

16:12.847 --> 16:16.768
nine out of ten will come back
with the same plodding, obvious solution.

16:16.851 --> 16:20.230
The tenth might just surprise you.

16:20.313 --> 16:25.777
All of this is surprising
and elegant and very, very clever.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.947
But there's something...

16:30.115 --> 16:31.658
Something?

16:32.450 --> 16:35.245
I'm having the strongest déjà vu.

16:36.079 --> 16:39.416
I could have sworn
I've seen this somewhere before.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.543
How is that possible?

16:41.626 --> 16:42.460
Mm.

16:46.464 --> 16:48.049
Leave it to me.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.344
I'll make some calls.

16:57.517 --> 17:01.688
So because of the House of Valois
in 13th-century France,

17:01.771 --> 17:04.941
women weren't allowed
to succeed to the throne.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.317
It's another lie.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.571
No, mate. It's in here.

17:09.654 --> 17:13.450
With Ian, it was a car crash.
With Sabina's dad, it's a gas leak.

17:14.409 --> 17:17.704
There was no gas.
One of us would have noticed.

17:19.581 --> 17:21.499
And there was someone
at the hospital today,

17:21.583 --> 17:22.834
trying to get into Ed's room.

17:22.917 --> 17:23.918
Who was it? Yassen?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.211
Mm-mm.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.671
I've never seen this guy before.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.882
But he ran
as soon as he saw me and Sabina coming.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.468
Clearly, Ed's been targeted.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.596
And the department need to know about it.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.681
Just when they've decided
to go into hiding.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.892
[Tom] Maybe they haven't gone into hiding.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.810
Maybe they all got fired.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.438
Because of what they did to you.

17:43.521 --> 17:46.900
Because, when you think about it, mate,
what they did was basically

17:46.983 --> 17:49.778
totally illegal, using you like that.

17:51.154 --> 17:55.116
So maybe someone found out,
and now they're all out on their ear,

17:55.200 --> 17:59.579
you know,
working as bouncers in night clubs.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.706
Is that what ex-spies do?

18:01.790 --> 18:04.167
I don't know. It's a job.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.921
I don't think they've been fired.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.590
I think they've just moved on
and left me behind.

18:10.673 --> 18:14.761
Even if you could get hold of Mrs. Jones,
what would you do?

18:14.844 --> 18:19.265
Tell them about the explosion,
about Gregorovich. Get them on it.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.476
Make sure Sabina's dad is protected.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.020
And then, you'll leave them to handle it?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.980
Yeah. Exactly.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.442
That's what they're supposed
to be good at, right?

18:29.526 --> 18:30.777
[sighs]

18:30.860 --> 18:36.324
The problem is, how do you find people
whose whole thing is to not be noticed?

18:36.407 --> 18:40.078
You know, I just realized
I don't even know their first names.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.996
I mean, they're spies, right?

18:42.997 --> 18:44.624
Spies don't let people in.

18:44.707 --> 18:49.170
Like, they don't let anyone close.
Spies don't have friends.

18:49.838 --> 18:50.839
Hm.

18:51.631 --> 18:56.678
Wait. Spies don't have friends?

18:58.263 --> 19:00.348
Sometimes they do.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.476
Yeah, of course.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.691
Whoa, sorry. Um, what did I miss?

19:09.774 --> 19:10.984
[chuckles]

19:11.818 --> 19:12.777
Friends.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.905
[gunshot]

19:16.906 --> 19:17.740
[David] Pull!

19:19.242 --> 19:21.244
-[Alex] Hey, Dad!
-[David] Damn it!

19:22.370 --> 19:23.580
What the hell?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.498
Alex?

19:25.582 --> 19:27.292
Alex Friend.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.877
Son of Sir David Friend.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.421
It was fun while it lasted.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.631
What are you doing here?

19:34.632 --> 19:35.842
Did Blunt send you?

19:37.427 --> 19:38.803
No.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.639
Kind of the opposite, actually.

19:43.141 --> 19:47.520
Did Blunt ever get in touch with you
after I went undercover at Point Blanc?

19:47.604 --> 19:49.272
[David] They never told us anything.

19:49.355 --> 19:53.067
You went away with that awful woman,
and that was the last we heard.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.779
I suppose everything worked out all right?

19:56.863 --> 19:59.616
Caroline and I were concerned.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.618
Yeah, it was fine.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.497
-It was just a school.
-I see.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.709
Well, good.

20:09.792 --> 20:13.004
And now you're no use to him anymore,

20:13.087 --> 20:16.090
Alan has just turned his back on you?

20:16.174 --> 20:17.508
He's ghosting me.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.386
Ignoring me. Hiding.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.181
I need to find him.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.350
No, you don't. I promise you.

20:25.433 --> 20:29.604
Whatever it is that's the matter,
whatever trouble you're in,

20:29.687 --> 20:31.814
that man will just make it worse.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.067
I don't have a choice.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.655
Funny, isn't it,
how that's often the way with Alan?

20:39.155 --> 20:41.157
No choice at all.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.915
-Do you have his address?
-We don't exchange Christmas cards.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.583
Phone number?

20:52.210 --> 20:53.920
You must know something.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.548
I read the briefing file,
you know, when I was...

20:57.632 --> 20:59.926
Pretending to be our son? Hm.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.386
Yeah.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.638
You guys were close, once.

21:03.721 --> 21:07.517
You don't seem to understand.
We were never close.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.061
He's not that kind of man.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.647
He just turns up when he wants something.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.566
You don't go to him.

21:23.408 --> 21:26.119
To be honest,
I hardly know anything about him.

21:26.202 --> 21:30.039
Not where he lives, not where he works,
not even what he does, really,

21:30.123 --> 21:34.585
except I suspect it's something that would
keep decent people awake at night.

21:35.253 --> 21:39.048
A long time ago,
we went to school together. That's it.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.677
We're not even members of the same club.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.640
-Do you know which club he is a member of?
-Alex...

21:47.724 --> 21:48.599
Look.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.436
A friend of mine got hurt.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.147
Someone tried to kill him.

21:54.731 --> 21:58.067
The only people that can help keep him and
his daughter safe are Blunt and his team.

21:58.151 --> 22:02.363
I wouldn't ask you
if I had any other choice, but I don't.

22:03.865 --> 22:06.034
I need your help. I really do.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.201
[scoffs]

22:09.078 --> 22:10.705
If I'm so embarrassing to Blunt,

22:10.788 --> 22:15.251
then wouldn't me turning up
at his club really annoy him?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.004
And wouldn't you kind of enjoy that?

22:19.172 --> 22:22.216
Alex, these people are dangerous.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.552
[sighs]

22:24.635 --> 22:26.054
David.

22:39.734 --> 22:40.860
Pull!

22:47.617 --> 22:48.993
I can take care of myself.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.625
I knew I'd seen him somewhere before.

22:57.126 --> 23:00.171
Remember this chap? Aaron Limehouse.

23:00.254 --> 23:03.800
Far-left political activist,
freedom-of-information advocate,

23:04.592 --> 23:07.386
not so keen on the British government's
anti-terrorism laws?

23:07.470 --> 23:11.432
Yes. Stole classified material
and posted it on the web.

23:11.516 --> 23:14.477
Did four years in Belmarsh
and got out six months ago.

23:14.560 --> 23:20.316
Now, ask me
how he got his classified material.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.362
He hacked the GCHQ computer system.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.992
On the left, four and a half years ago,
GCHQ Cheltenham.

23:30.076 --> 23:34.372
On the right,
six months ago, the Pentagon.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.544
The digital fingerprints match.
It's the same guy.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.462
Limehouse is Smoking Mirror?

23:41.546 --> 23:44.257
No, but he took credit for the hack.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.800
No way has he the skill.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.888
Limehouse employed Smoking Mirror.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.518
How far can we go?

23:57.854 --> 23:59.772
As far as you like.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.859
[ominous music playing]

24:15.663 --> 24:17.081
-All right?
-Yup.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.416
Steph says hi.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.458
Yeah?

24:19.542 --> 24:23.337
Yeah, she also says, "Maybe Alex can run
his own errands without your help, Tom,

24:23.421 --> 24:24.755
given that you promised
to go over the lines

24:24.839 --> 24:26.465
for the school play
with me this weekend."

24:26.549 --> 24:29.468
But I convinced her you're
basically helpless left to yourself.

24:29.552 --> 24:32.180
Well, I got you out of Shakespeare.

24:32.263 --> 24:34.515
-You should be thanking me.
-Fair enough.

24:34.599 --> 24:35.683
So where's this club?

24:36.559 --> 24:37.518
Um...

24:38.060 --> 24:40.813
-A little place in Pall Mall.
-Hm.

24:41.564 --> 24:42.815
Do you think they'll let us in?

24:42.899 --> 24:45.902
[classical music playing over speakers]

24:46.194 --> 24:48.196
Is this for real?

24:48.279 --> 24:50.156
In what sense?

24:50.823 --> 24:56.662
Silver spoons and chandeliers
and gentlemen doing business.

24:57.455 --> 25:00.750
Well, I thought it would be good to get
to know each other a little better,

25:00.833 --> 25:03.252
and this place is comfortable.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.339
Comfortable for those
on the inside, maybe.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.342
Intimidating to those on the outside.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.302
Oh.

25:11.385 --> 25:15.723
One of the oldest tricks
in the colonial-imperial playbook.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.517
Don't worry, we do it too.

25:18.601 --> 25:22.021
The whole of D.C.'s an exercise
in architectural intimidation.

25:22.772 --> 25:23.773
Hm.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.070
We haven't worked together before.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.906
-No.
-I hear you're full of innovations.

25:33.616 --> 25:35.034
New ideas.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.120
Well, it's not just about
boots on the ground anymore.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.624
-Hm.
-The way Russia and China are shaping up,

25:41.707 --> 25:45.753
the CIA needs to be leaner,
quicker, more responsive.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.883
Part of my remit
is clearing out dead wood.

25:51.759 --> 25:52.760
Hm.

25:57.682 --> 26:00.226
Well, I knew your old boss.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.229
Yes, I know.

26:03.938 --> 26:07.316
-You went back a long way.
-He was a good man.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.112
He was an old man.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.536
You should try the rabbit terrine.
It's very good.

26:33.217 --> 26:35.636
[gasping]

26:37.305 --> 26:39.765
[Jones] Good evening, Mr. Limehouse.

26:39.849 --> 26:41.058
[Limehouse] Who are you?

26:41.142 --> 26:42.852
What happened to me?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.813
-I was...
-[Crawley] You were in the shower.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.190
I'm afraid you had an accident.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.234
[Jones] Yes, you slipped on the soap,

26:50.318 --> 26:52.611
banged your head.
You were quite badly hurt.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.071
[Crawley] In fact...

26:57.033 --> 26:58.409
it was worse than that.

27:02.413 --> 27:03.331
[sighs]

27:06.709 --> 27:09.003
[Tom] So how do we
even know Blunt's in there?

27:09.086 --> 27:11.047
[Alex] Because that's his car.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.174
He gave me a lift once.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.009
[Tom] Okay.

27:15.092 --> 27:18.888
So we wait. He comes out.
And we doorstep him.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.306
No.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.724
It's not good enough.

27:22.850 --> 27:24.435
What if he just blows me off,
you know, and says,

27:24.518 --> 27:26.645
"Oh, I can't talk right now,"
and just drives away?

27:26.729 --> 27:28.230
Then I've lost him for good.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.943
I need to know where they're operating.

27:33.027 --> 27:36.864
That way, I can walk in the front door,
and they have to listen.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.910
Okay. So we follow the car.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.290
-Yeah.
-He's gonna see you.

27:46.374 --> 27:50.419
I mean, he'll look in the mirror,
and then there's just Alex on a bike.

27:55.633 --> 27:56.842
Give me your helmet.

27:58.552 --> 28:01.180
[suspenseful music playing]

28:01.263 --> 28:03.682
It's fake news, of course.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.643
An ambulance came for you.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.396
You don't remember. It brought you here.

28:09.313 --> 28:11.774
-Where's here?
-Doesn't really matter.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.568
It's where you're going
that ought to worry you.

28:14.652 --> 28:17.780
-America.
-Forced rendition. The flight's waiting.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.449
What? Why?

28:20.533 --> 28:24.161
Four and a half years ago,
you hacked into GCHQ Cheltenham.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.914
You stole classified information
and posted it on the web.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.082
I did my time.

28:28.165 --> 28:31.836
Six months ago,
just after you were released,

28:31.919 --> 28:34.713
the same hacker,
with the same digital fingerprint,

28:34.797 --> 28:38.092
known as Smoking Mirror,
broke into the Pentagon.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.886
This time,
the target was the nuclear codes.

28:40.970 --> 28:45.599
-[Jones] The Americans aren't too pleased.
-Wait. This is crazy. I didn't do that.

28:46.183 --> 28:48.561
-What are you doing?
-Preparing you for your journey.

28:48.644 --> 28:51.522
Guantanamo is a long way.
You should sleep on the flight.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.606
[Limehouse] It wasn't me.

28:52.690 --> 28:56.777
Not the Pentagon and not GCHQ either.
I used someone. I paid someone.

28:56.861 --> 28:58.487
-We know that's a lie.
-I swear to you.

28:59.155 --> 29:02.032
-Hold tight.
-No, no, no, no, no! You can't do this!

29:03.200 --> 29:05.536
It was Simon Marriat.

29:05.619 --> 29:08.539
-He's Smoking Mirror.
-[Jones] Simon Marriat.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.128
Goodbye, Mr. Limehouse.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.343
-Take him home, put him to bed.
-Yes, ma'am.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.061
You know the President is due here
in little over a week.

29:31.854 --> 29:36.025
Yes. We, uh, we've got the bunting in.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.736
But she's not here
for more than one night, is she?

29:38.819 --> 29:39.862
Mm.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.908
Damian Cray is hosting a charity dinner.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.702
Lots of important people
digging deep in their wallets.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.330
-Mm.
-The President's the guest of honor.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.916
Mr. Cray is a big admirer
of the President, isn't he?

29:51.999 --> 29:53.626
It's mutual.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.462
Cray gave millions to the campaign fund,

29:56.545 --> 30:00.341
millions more
to the President's anti-drug initiatives.

30:00.424 --> 30:05.596
He seems to think the war on drugs
can be won, and he is the man to win it.

30:05.679 --> 30:08.599
It's a message
the White House is happy to get behind.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.435
Anyway, I'm catching a lift

30:11.519 --> 30:13.771
on Air Force One
when the President leaves for Berlin.

30:14.355 --> 30:17.775
I wanna be able to brief her on the plane
about our Smoking Mirror issue.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.569
It would be good to have something to say.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.738
You can say that we've found him.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.824
[pensive music playing]

30:37.795 --> 30:39.755
[Tom] Alex, get ready.
They're getting in the car.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.006
[engines start]

30:42.132 --> 30:44.635
[car doors shut]

30:49.473 --> 30:51.016
Car cam is up and running.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.726
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.813
[techno music playing]

31:02.194 --> 31:03.195
I've already lost him.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.030
Don't worry. He went right up ahead.

31:05.114 --> 31:06.699
[Alex] Did you get a street name?

31:06.782 --> 31:10.244
No, um, it's a big street.
Um, it's got trees.

31:10.327 --> 31:11.745
-They've all got trees.
-Yeah.

31:11.829 --> 31:15.916
-Um, go right. Go right.
-Go right...

31:20.254 --> 31:21.755
[Byrne] How did you find him?

31:21.839 --> 31:24.258
We got a name
and that gave us the address.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.011
-We're about 15 minutes away.
-Good.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.932
Okay, he's just gone through
a traffic light. It's turning red.

31:32.016 --> 31:32.891
[Alex] I see it!

31:32.975 --> 31:34.977
[tires screeching and horns honking]

31:35.060 --> 31:36.186
[woman] Oi!

31:44.194 --> 31:45.195
[Alex] Talk to me.

31:45.279 --> 31:47.197
[Tom] He's just gone past a bus.

31:47.281 --> 31:48.282
Can you see it?

31:49.074 --> 31:50.409
-[Alex] Whoa!
-[horn honks]

31:50.492 --> 31:51.493
[driver] Idiot!

31:51.577 --> 31:52.411
[horn honks]

31:52.494 --> 31:54.413
Yeah. I saw that.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.252
-Okay, he turned left.
-Are you sure?

32:00.336 --> 32:02.421
Yes. Go left.

32:03.964 --> 32:05.758
Keep going straight.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.929
[Jones] We have units inbound.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.849
We'll establish a perimeter,
do a soft entry if we can.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.309
All right. Keep me posted.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.354
[suspenseful music playing]

32:18.437 --> 32:19.605
He turned left.

32:21.315 --> 32:23.150
[Alex] All right, I'm on
Holdsworth Street. Where are they?

32:24.360 --> 32:27.154
Um, I think you missed him.
I think you've gone too far.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.824
Um... there's a turning on the left.

32:31.408 --> 32:32.743
[Alex] Going left.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.037
-It's an alley.
-Go left.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.331
[car horns honking]

32:37.414 --> 32:40.042
-[Alex] Shit, Tom!
-[woman yells indistinctly]

32:40.125 --> 32:41.669
It's one way.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.423
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to find another way.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.969
-Just tell me where they are.
-I'm trying!

32:59.812 --> 33:01.397
[Alex] I see it. I've got them.

33:08.862 --> 33:12.533
-He's turning onto Eden Square.
-Okay. Doing the same.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.205
[Tom]
Great. Keep going straight.

33:21.709 --> 33:24.712
[ominous music playing]

33:33.554 --> 33:37.182
[Smithers] All units,
Simon Marriat is entering the property.

33:37.850 --> 33:40.894
Hi, honey. I'm home.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.939
[footsteps approaching]

33:58.912 --> 34:01.915
[suspenseful music playing]

34:08.714 --> 34:10.174
Here we go.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.098
All units, Control, position.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.934
[SWAT Commander]
All units in position.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.653
[Blunt] This is Blunt.
We're here. Rear of property.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.324
[Smithers] Suggest you leave the vehicle
and join the tactical control van.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.576
All units standby to commence operation.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.955
All right. Remember.
Let's try this quietly at first.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.125
[SWAT Commander]
Unit one, proceed.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.044
All other units, prepare for breach.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.098
[doorbell buzzing]

35:14.571 --> 35:15.489
Yeah. Who is it?

35:16.782 --> 35:17.991
Council sent me.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.911
Been a problem
with your rising main.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.997
[ominous music playing]

35:26.250 --> 35:28.377
Yeah, just, um, give me a sec.

35:32.548 --> 35:35.509
[ominous music playing]

35:50.148 --> 35:53.026
[Tom] Okay, car's parked on the left
next to some garages.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.403
But they got out and walked away.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.699
[Alex] Strange place for their HQ.
Good work, Tom.

35:58.782 --> 35:59.825
Cheers.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.670
- We're made.
-All right.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.630
Let's go in. Cut the power.

36:29.479 --> 36:30.647
[beeps]

36:34.484 --> 36:36.695
-[agent] We're in.
-Okay.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.752
[female agent]
Top floor clear of target.

36:51.835 --> 36:54.880
[male agent] Ground floor clear of target.
Proceeding to basement.

37:02.763 --> 37:04.181
There's no one here.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.768
[Crawley] Okay, we're coming in.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.363
[Smithers] Where are you, Simon?

37:21.740 --> 37:22.783
It's definitely our guy.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.328
-I thought you cut the power.
-[Smithers] I did. Back-up units.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.746
He was expecting us.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.706
-Where is he?
-He must be here somewhere.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.168
[indistinct radio transmission]

37:34.294 --> 37:36.296
[Crawley] This has been moved.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.549
Give me a hand.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.059
He went through here. Go!

37:49.142 --> 37:50.018
Go!

37:50.102 --> 37:53.063
All units, Control, he's mobile.
We found a tunnel.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.524
Hold the perimeter and watch for a runner.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.610
[suspenseful music playing]

38:06.451 --> 38:07.452
Hey.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.538
You.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.582
Hey!

38:12.666 --> 38:14.292
Stop! Stop!

38:14.376 --> 38:15.460
[both grunting]

38:34.354 --> 38:35.605
[Crawley] He was ready for us.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.359
Clearly expecting trouble.
He prepared an escape route.

38:40.652 --> 38:44.656
[indistinct radio transmission]

38:50.912 --> 38:52.372
Don't tell me you lost him.

38:57.044 --> 39:00.630
[Smithers]
I need to get a good look at his setup.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.258
Can you get me a bit closer, please?
Follow the cables.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.719
That's it. Keep going.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.681
We have him.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.563
Hello.

39:18.815 --> 39:19.816
What the...?

39:24.821 --> 39:26.281
Are you gonna tell these idiots
to let me go or what?

39:26.364 --> 39:28.784
What are you doing here?

39:28.867 --> 39:30.160
Smoking Mirror?

39:30.869 --> 39:33.538
No. There's been a misunderstanding.

39:33.622 --> 39:35.165
Who's Smoking Mirror?

39:42.672 --> 39:44.091
[keypad beeping]

39:47.803 --> 39:50.013
Follow the cables. Yep. That's it.

39:52.599 --> 39:55.352
Everyone get away from the machines!
Right now! Now!

39:55.435 --> 39:57.604
-Get back! Get back! Get down!
-Get down! Take cover!

39:57.687 --> 39:58.522
[beeps]

40:12.828 --> 40:13.954
[water splashes]

40:19.960 --> 40:22.796
[ominous music playing]

41:00.083 --> 41:02.335
[elevator whirring]

41:05.505 --> 41:07.048
How come you moved?

41:08.341 --> 41:10.385
Health and safety.

41:12.804 --> 41:15.432
-There was asbestos.
-Ah.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.908
[indistinct chatter]

41:39.706 --> 41:42.959
He was driving a gray transit van.

41:43.043 --> 41:46.630
The plate ended with the letters VRC.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.549
And it had "Rob's Internet Services"
on the side.

41:49.633 --> 41:52.510
He must have placed a device in the house,

41:52.594 --> 41:55.430
probably a bomb
that made it look like a gas leak,

41:55.513 --> 41:56.556
but it wasn't.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.725
I mean, it tore everything apart.

41:58.808 --> 42:01.061
There was smoke everywhere.
It was on fire.

42:02.229 --> 42:04.481
That's it. That's all of it.

42:04.564 --> 42:07.567
-And you think that this man...
-Yassen Gregorovich.

42:07.651 --> 42:12.155
You think this man, Yassen Gregorovich,
tried to kill your girlfriend's father.

42:12.239 --> 42:16.034
She's not my girlfriend.
We just met. But, yeah. Exactly.

42:16.117 --> 42:16.993
Why?

42:17.077 --> 42:19.120
-Why?
-[Blunt] Why would he do that?

42:19.204 --> 42:22.666
Because of something he was working on.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.627
I don't know. You should find out.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.171
[Blunt]
What do you know about Yassen Gregorovich?

42:28.922 --> 42:30.799
I know that he was in Point Blanc.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.594
I know that you have
his photograph on file.

42:34.678 --> 42:38.348
I know that you know his name
and I know that he's important to you.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.394
When I told you about him,
the man with the scar,

42:42.477 --> 42:44.062
you recognized him at once.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.191
Gregorovich works
for an international organization.

42:48.275 --> 42:52.195
They have their sights set
on regime change, political murder,

42:52.279 --> 42:54.739
global shifts in the balance of power.

42:54.823 --> 42:56.449
They're professionals.

42:56.533 --> 43:00.996
And their services are only available to
a very tiny fraction of the world's elite.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.372
Yeah.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.375
Okay. So?

43:05.458 --> 43:07.794
So they don't care
that one of their agents saw you

43:07.877 --> 43:09.713
in a corridor once upon a time.

43:09.796 --> 43:10.714
[sighs]

43:10.797 --> 43:13.633
You're not important to them.
You're irrelevant.

43:13.717 --> 43:17.762
-I never said this was about me.
-Really? I thought it was all about you.

43:17.846 --> 43:19.973
Your girlfriend, your holiday,

43:20.056 --> 43:23.268
your insistence
that this wasn't an accident

43:23.351 --> 43:25.478
when everyone else says that it was.

43:25.562 --> 43:28.898
We've seen the forensic report.
It was a gas leak.

43:28.982 --> 43:30.525
So they faked it.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.237
That's happened before, remember?

43:34.321 --> 43:36.448
You're just gonna believe
whatever story they tell you?

43:36.531 --> 43:37.782
I thought you were good at this.

43:37.866 --> 43:42.454
We are. We've had Gregorovich
under surveillance for months now.

43:43.330 --> 43:46.750
He's on the other side of the world,
in Myanmar.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.627
Not in Cornwall.

43:50.211 --> 43:51.880
Nowhere near you.

43:52.464 --> 43:54.382
That's not possible.

43:54.466 --> 43:58.053
You did a good job for us, Alex,
on the Point Blanc mission.

43:58.136 --> 44:01.431
Very good, for someone so young.

44:01.514 --> 44:04.768
But I think that we dropped you
into the deep end

44:04.851 --> 44:07.103
of a world
that you're not quite ready for.

44:07.187 --> 44:09.981
And now you're seeing enemy agents
around every corner

44:10.065 --> 44:12.609
even when, in fact,
there is nothing there.

44:13.234 --> 44:14.069
I saw him.

44:17.280 --> 44:22.160
-Aren't you supposed to trust your agents?
-You're not an agent.

44:22.243 --> 44:24.037
Go home.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.174
What the hell are you doing?

44:36.257 --> 44:39.302
-We have no idea where Gregorovich is.
-Sit down.

44:39.386 --> 44:42.389
He said it. Trust your agent.

44:42.472 --> 44:44.516
You like him, don't you?

44:44.599 --> 44:47.018
Yes. As a matter of fact, yes.

44:47.102 --> 44:49.020
You need to be more objective.

44:49.104 --> 44:54.776
He's jumping at shadows.
Psychologically, he's not reliable.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.403
And how are you sure of that?

44:57.779 --> 44:59.489
Experience.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.742
Well, he's our responsibility.

45:02.826 --> 45:05.412
No, he's a liability.

45:05.495 --> 45:08.665
We lost our man today because of him.

45:09.666 --> 45:13.294
We have a job to do.
From now on, Alex Rider is no part of it.

45:13.378 --> 45:14.212
Clear?

45:31.020 --> 45:32.439
Alex.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.650
Wait.

45:37.152 --> 45:38.862
What's the point?

45:39.863 --> 45:42.282
-I want to say I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

45:43.283 --> 45:45.910
Yes. I really am.

45:46.786 --> 45:47.954
About your friend.

45:49.831 --> 45:51.583
Her name's Sabina.

45:51.666 --> 45:53.042
Her dad's called Ed.

45:53.126 --> 45:55.211
And she doesn't know
if he's gonna wake up or not.

45:58.965 --> 46:00.300
Do you believe me?

46:00.383 --> 46:03.011
[dramatic music playing]

46:04.345 --> 46:06.097
Yeah. I have to go.

46:06.181 --> 46:07.015
Where?

46:07.807 --> 46:09.350
To do your job.
