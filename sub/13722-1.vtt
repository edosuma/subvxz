WEBVTT

03:59.015 --> 04:01.226
Dick Laurent is dead.

05:48.713 --> 05:53.033
You don't mind that
I'm not coming to the club tonight?

05:54.760 --> 05:56.760
What are you going to do?

05:58.390 --> 06:00.766
Stay home, read.

06:04.354 --> 06:06.354
Read?

06:16.408 --> 06:18.408
Read?

06:19.829 --> 06:21.829
Read what, Renee?

06:28.463 --> 06:32.063
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.802
I like to laugh, Fred.

06:41.185 --> 06:43.395
That's why I married you.

06:48.150 --> 06:52.230
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

10:32.219 --> 10:34.219
What is that?

10:39.893 --> 10:41.937
A videotape.

10:44.815 --> 10:47.375
I found it outside on the steps.

10:51.197 --> 10:53.197
Who's it from?

10:54.034 --> 10:56.034
I don't know.

10:57.412 --> 11:00.372
There isn't anything on the envelope.

11:03.335 --> 11:05.975
Does it say anything on the tape?

11:11.260 --> 11:13.260
No. Nothing.

11:16.140 --> 11:18.434
Well, see what's on it.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.160
Come on.

12:15.786 --> 12:18.455
Must be from a real estate agent.

12:20.541 --> 12:22.541
Maybe.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.720
It's OK.

15:54.599 --> 15:56.599
It's OK.

15:57.477 --> 15:59.477
It's OK.

16:49.823 --> 16:52.117
I had a dream last night.

16:56.789 --> 16:59.029
You were inside the house...

17:07.717 --> 17:09.877
You were calling my name...

17:14.266 --> 17:16.266
Fred.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.772
Fred.

17:23.984 --> 17:25.984
Where are you.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.450
I couldn't find you.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.930
Then there you were...

17:54.808 --> 17:56.808
...Iying in bed.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.560
It wasn't you.

18:00.147 --> 18:03.901
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

18:26.340 --> 18:29.845
Fred, are you all right?

19:36.749 --> 19:38.876
You're up early.

19:40.044 --> 19:42.044
That dog woke me.

19:52.932 --> 19:55.560
Who the hell owns that dog?

20:06.771 --> 20:08.771
What's that?

20:13.153 --> 20:15.198
Another videotape.

20:16.199 --> 20:18.199
Yes.

20:30.588 --> 20:32.748
Don't you want to watch it?

20:34.217 --> 20:36.217
I guess so.

20:52.486 --> 20:55.126
Well, don't you want to watch it?

20:55.322 --> 20:57.322
Yeah.

21:08.378 --> 21:10.378
It's the same thing.

21:15.844 --> 21:17.844
No, it isn't.

21:25.897 --> 21:27.897
Fred?

21:41.037 --> 21:43.037
What?

21:54.351 --> 21:56.896
We have to call the police.

21:57.855 --> 21:59.855
That's right. Yes.

22:04.778 --> 22:10.534
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

22:13.121 --> 22:15.247
7035 Hollis.

22:16.833 --> 22:19.294
Near the observatory.

22:21.087 --> 22:23.087
Yes.

22:23.798 --> 22:25.798
We'll be here.

22:30.223 --> 22:32.223
So?

22:32.934 --> 22:35.574
They're sending 2 detectives out.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.495
That's it.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.482
What do you think.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.793
I really don't know.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.336
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

23:33.247 --> 23:35.247
This is the bedroom?

23:36.040 --> 23:39.320
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.840
This is our bedroom.

23:47.928 --> 23:49.928
There's no other bedroom?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.600
No.

23:55.102 --> 23:59.482
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

24:00.442 --> 24:02.093
It's soundproof.

24:02.193 --> 24:04.193
You're a musician?

24:05.030 --> 24:06.307
Yeah.

24:06.407 --> 24:08.100
What's your axe?

24:08.200 --> 24:10.744
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

24:12.370 --> 24:15.124
Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.361
Do you own a video camera?

24:18.461 --> 24:20.461
No.

24:21.380 --> 24:23.380
Fred hates them.

24:30.139 --> 24:33.142
I like to remember things my own way.

24:34.435 --> 24:36.435
What do you mean by that?

24:38.941 --> 24:43.901
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.616
You have an alarm system?

24:49.619 --> 24:52.288
Yes. Actually, we do.

24:52.914 --> 24:55.794
But we haven't been using it lately.

24:56.876 --> 24:58.876
Why not?

25:00.922 --> 25:03.132
It kept going off...

25:04.342 --> 25:07.845
For some reason. False alarms.

25:09.639 --> 25:12.439
Might want to try and use it again.

25:12.475 --> 25:14.475
Yeah.

25:16.647 --> 25:18.647
OK?

25:21.318 --> 25:24.708
We're going to check
the windows and doors,

25:24.808 --> 25:27.448
see if anybody tried to break in.

26:38.733 --> 26:43.453
We'll keep watch over the house.
- We'll do the best we can.

26:44.572 --> 26:48.652
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
- We will.

26:49.869 --> 26:53.123
Thanks, guys.
- It's what we do.

27:28.118 --> 27:31.955
Hey, Andy. Welcome to my party.

27:32.873 --> 27:35.353
You look ravishing.
- Thank you.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.016
Fred.

27:52.768 --> 27:54.768
Please.

27:55.897 --> 27:57.897
Please.

27:59.358 --> 28:01.358
Hey.

28:16.852 --> 28:19.689
2 double scotches, neat.
- OK.

29:11.076 --> 29:13.871
We've met before, haven't we?

29:17.416 --> 29:19.416
I don't think so.

29:21.712 --> 29:24.382
Where was it you think we met?

29:25.841 --> 29:28.561
At your house. Don't you remember?

29:31.722 --> 29:33.722
No. No, I don't.

29:34.976 --> 29:36.976
Are you sure?

29:37.228 --> 29:39.228
Of course.

29:40.273 --> 29:44.570
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

29:49.408 --> 29:52.995
What do you mean?
You're where right now?

29:54.663 --> 29:57.333
At your house.

30:01.045 --> 30:03.423
That's fucking crazy, man.

30:11.973 --> 30:13.973
Call me.

30:20.148 --> 30:22.148
Dial your number.

30:25.905 --> 30:27.905
Go ahead.

30:39.335 --> 30:42.171
I told you I was here.

30:45.633 --> 30:47.633
How'd you do that?

30:50.805 --> 30:52.805
Ask me.

30:58.856 --> 31:00.466
How'd you get inside my house?

31:00.566 --> 31:06.406
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.532
Who are you?

31:09.784 --> 31:11.784
Hm.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.668
Give me back my phone.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.018
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

31:50.910 --> 31:55.023
I thought you were getting me a drink.
- Hang on just a minute.

31:55.123 --> 31:59.920
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

32:01.296 --> 32:06.176
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

32:09.554 --> 32:11.554
Dick Laurent?

32:12.183 --> 32:14.393
Yeah. I believe so.

32:20.691 --> 32:23.491
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

32:25.447 --> 32:27.447
He is?

32:28.199 --> 32:32.599
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

32:35.540 --> 32:37.540
I don't.

32:38.335 --> 32:40.335
I don't know him.

32:40.712 --> 32:42.712
Dick can't be dead.

32:43.340 --> 32:45.467
Who told you he was dead?

32:46.051 --> 32:49.556
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

32:52.141 --> 32:53.877
Let's go home.

32:53.977 --> 32:56.457
But...
- Now. We're leaving now.

32:59.607 --> 33:03.607
We never should have come
here in the first place.

33:09.034 --> 33:12.554
So, how'd you meet that
asshole Andy anyway?

33:15.958 --> 33:17.958
It was a long time ago.

33:20.420 --> 33:22.980
We met at a place called Moke's.

33:24.466 --> 33:26.466
We became friends.

33:27.429 --> 33:29.429
He told me about a job.

33:30.097 --> 33:32.097
What job?

33:34.477 --> 33:36.477
I don't remember.

33:38.190 --> 33:41.276
Anyway...Andy's OK.

33:45.113 --> 33:48.713
Well, He's got some
pretty fucked-up friends.

33:57.459 --> 33:59.459
Hey...
Hey...

34:00.505 --> 34:02.505
Stay in the car.

35:30.724 --> 35:32.793
I told you to stay in the car.

35:32.893 --> 35:36.230
Why? What is it?

35:37.022 --> 35:39.817
Why did you make me stay out here?

35:42.445 --> 35:47.725
I'll tell you why, because I thought
someone was inside the house.

35:49.035 --> 35:51.497
Was there?

35:53.456 --> 35:55.456
No, of course not.

38:40.766 --> 38:42.766
Fred?

38:49.483 --> 38:52.111
Fred, where are you?

41:47.420 --> 41:49.420
Renee.

41:50.590 --> 41:51.823
Renee.

41:51.923 --> 41:53.968
Sit down, Killer.

41:58.639 --> 42:00.639
I didn't kill her.

42:03.561 --> 42:05.688
Tell me I didn't kill her.

42:18.836 --> 42:24.356
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

42:29.890 --> 42:34.670
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

42:34.770 --> 42:39.730
it is my order that you be put
to death in the electric chair.

42:51.870 --> 42:56.250
Make yourself to home, fella.

43:04.425 --> 43:06.585
Stick your hand out, chief.

45:20.860 --> 45:22.860
Something wrong?

45:27.534 --> 45:29.534
It's...my head.

45:55.271 --> 45:57.271
You sleeping OK?

45:57.607 --> 45:59.607
No.

46:00.152 --> 46:02.279
I can't sleep.

46:51.914 --> 46:53.914
You'll sleep now.

46:55.168 --> 46:57.462
Take him back to his cell.

46:59.130 --> 47:01.130
Let's go.

47:12.435 --> 47:14.435
Guard.

47:17.565 --> 47:19.565
Guard.

47:31.038 --> 47:33.038
Guard.

47:37.712 --> 47:39.712
Hey.

47:41.966 --> 47:43.966
What do you want?

47:44.886 --> 47:47.806
Aspirin.
My head.

47:50.475 --> 47:52.475
Hey. Hey.

48:05.240 --> 48:09.329
Shit. That wife killer's
looking pretty fucked up.

48:09.996 --> 48:11.996
Which one?

49:58.651 --> 50:00.651
Pete.

50:00.821 --> 50:02.821
Please don't go.

50:03.906 --> 50:05.516
No. Pete.

50:05.616 --> 50:08.256
Pete...Pete...Pete.
Wait a minute.

51:35.920 --> 51:38.381
Fuck me.

51:48.100 --> 51:49.752
All right. What's the situation?

51:49.852 --> 51:55.132
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

52:09.038 --> 52:11.038
Right here.

52:15.545 --> 52:17.545
That's not Fred Madison.

52:19.591 --> 52:21.591
No, Sir. It's not.

52:25.805 --> 52:28.558
Who is it?
- I couldn't say, Sir.

52:30.728 --> 52:32.728
Captain Luneau?

52:32.730 --> 52:34.730
Yeah, Mike?

52:34.814 --> 52:36.259
Captain...

52:36.359 --> 52:39.319
This is some spooky shit we got here.

52:48.538 --> 52:52.138
Well, Gentlemen, we know
who the stranger is.

52:53.126 --> 52:56.806
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

52:56.963 --> 53:00.300
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft...

53:01.009 --> 53:04.769
...for which he was put
on probation for 1 year.

53:04.805 --> 53:11.771
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

54:03.825 --> 54:05.825
So...

54:46.244 --> 54:48.538
Here.
- Thanks, Lou.

56:40.490 --> 56:43.210
Where the fuck have you been, man?

56:43.785 --> 56:45.945
Hey. -Hiya. -Hi.
- Hey, guy.

56:46.663 --> 56:49.207
Hey, man.
- What's up man?

56:49.957 --> 56:52.502
Well, you look like shit.

56:52.710 --> 56:54.710
Yeah. What happened?

56:55.963 --> 56:58.032
Just haven't been feeling so good.

56:58.132 --> 57:00.202
You're not contagious, are you?

57:00.302 --> 57:01.995
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

57:02.095 --> 57:04.163
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

57:04.263 --> 57:07.543
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

57:07.643 --> 57:10.671
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

57:10.771 --> 57:13.891
But it's worth it when you know that...

57:13.984 --> 57:15.718
Come on.
- Hoh.

57:15.818 --> 57:17.386
Come on. I'll lead.

57:17.486 --> 57:22.126
...and a glass of fresh, cold
milk from grandmother's cow.

57:23.410 --> 57:25.102
See ya later.

57:25.202 --> 57:28.212
I'm gonna go out with
these clowns for a while.

57:28.312 --> 57:30.150
That should do you some good.

57:30.250 --> 57:34.713
Good night. -See ya.
- Good night.

58:03.184 --> 58:05.184
What's happening to you?

58:06.646 --> 58:08.806
What happened to your face?

58:10.276 --> 58:14.116
I don't know?
- What do you mean, you don't know?

58:14.280 --> 58:17.000
You've been acting strange lately.

58:17.199 --> 58:19.199
Like the other night.

58:21.204 --> 58:22.938
What night?

58:23.038 --> 58:25.333
The last time I saw you.

58:26.251 --> 58:28.251
I don't remember.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.182
You still care about me?

59:07.502 --> 59:09.502
Pete.

59:11.173 --> 59:13.173
Arnie.
- Where you been?

59:13.300 --> 59:15.995
How you doing?
- It's good you're back...

59:16.095 --> 59:18.975
...Wonderful.
- Good to see you, man.

59:19.057 --> 59:19.873
Listen, man, a lot of people...

59:19.973 --> 59:23.460
...gonna be real happy that
you're back, including me.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.255
Well, it's good to be back.

59:25.355 --> 59:27.589
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

59:27.689 --> 59:29.134
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

59:29.234 --> 59:31.860
And Mr. Eddy called.

59:32.070 --> 59:36.850
Can I call him and tell him to come in?
- Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

59:36.950 --> 59:39.710
And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
- You're ready to work?

59:39.810 --> 59:40.020
Yeah.

59:40.120 --> 59:43.480
Well, let's go to work.
- All right, Buddy.

59:46.127 --> 59:48.127
Petey's back.

1:00:05.647 --> 1:00:07.807
There's 9 People down here.

1:00:08.190 --> 1:00:13.472
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

1:00:13.572 --> 1:00:16.132
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

1:00:25.667 --> 1:00:27.667
Hey, Pete.

1:00:30.422 --> 1:00:32.422
Pete.

1:00:34.385 --> 1:00:36.385
Where's Pete?

1:00:36.763 --> 1:00:38.206
He's back there.

1:00:38.306 --> 1:00:40.306
Mr. Eddy.

1:00:40.933 --> 1:00:42.933
Hey.

1:00:46.064 --> 1:00:48.064
What happened?

1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:50.052
Somebody giving you trouble?
- No. No trouble.

1:00:50.152 --> 1:00:54.072
'Cause if somebody's giving
you trouble, Pete,...

1:00:54.156 --> 1:00:57.017
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that.

1:00:57.117 --> 1:01:01.497
No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
- I mean it, Pete. Like...that.

1:01:01.747 --> 1:01:04.233
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

1:01:04.333 --> 1:01:08.697
...just a regular tune-up?
- I want you to take a ride with me.

1:01:08.797 --> 1:01:11.116
I don't like the sound of something.

1:01:11.216 --> 1:01:17.296
OK. I got to check in with the boss.
- It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

1:01:50.549 --> 1:01:53.269
Pull it over, but keep it running.

1:02:13.981 --> 1:02:16.443
Best goddamn ears in town.

1:02:31.292 --> 1:02:33.292
Give that a try.

1:02:39.258 --> 1:02:44.388
Beautiful...Smooth as
shit from a duck's ass.

1:02:47.183 --> 1:02:50.943
Let's take a ride.
- Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

1:03:04.201 --> 1:03:06.244
It's a beautiful day.

1:03:13.586 --> 1:03:16.226
You did a great job, Pete.
- Yeah.

1:03:16.923 --> 1:03:21.083
Well, you know I like working
on this car, Mr. Eddy.

1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:41.020
Shit. That cocksucker doing
what I think he's doing?

1:04:12.105 --> 1:04:13.758
This is where mechanical excellence...

1:04:13.858 --> 1:04:17.527
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

1:04:53.023 --> 1:04:55.023
Ahh...Oh, oh, God.

1:05:00.113 --> 1:05:04.660
Don't you ever fucking tailgate.

1:05:05.161 --> 1:05:07.146
Ever.
- Tell him you won't tailgate.

1:05:07.246 --> 1:05:08.398
Ever.

1:05:08.498 --> 1:05:09.498
I won't ever...

1:05:09.598 --> 1:05:11.902
Do you know how many fucking
car lengths it takes...

1:05:12.002 --> 1:05:15.171
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?.

1:05:15.379 --> 1:05:19.699
6 fucking car lengths.
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister.

1:05:19.843 --> 1:05:22.579
If I had to stop suddenly,
you would've hit me.

1:05:22.679 --> 1:05:27.376
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual.
I want you to study that motherfucker.

1:05:27.476 --> 1:05:29.878
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules.

1:05:29.978 --> 1:05:34.049
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

1:05:34.149 --> 1:05:37.109
Because of fucking assholes like you.

1:05:37.569 --> 1:05:43.660
Tell me you're going to get a manual.
- I will ge-get a manual.

1:05:46.371 --> 1:05:48.231
Fucking ldiot.

1:05:48.331 --> 1:05:51.417
Oh.. Aah.. Oh, Gooood.

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:32.910
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

1:06:33.462 --> 1:06:37.299
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

1:06:38.842 --> 1:06:40.842
Yeah, I can see that.

1:06:51.564 --> 1:06:53.564
Wait a minute.

1:06:57.945 --> 1:07:00.585
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
- No, thank you.

1:07:00.866 --> 1:07:03.666
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

1:07:05.204 --> 1:07:06.814
You like pornos?

1:07:06.914 --> 1:07:09.373
Pornos?
- Give you a boner?

1:07:10.542 --> 1:07:13.337
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

1:07:13.962 --> 1:07:15.962
Suit yourself, champ.

1:07:16.715 --> 1:07:20.719
Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
- You will.

1:07:27.309 --> 1:07:29.309
Damn.

1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:39.907
Lou, you recognize that guy?

1:07:42.201 --> 1:07:44.662
Yeah...Laurent.

1:08:55.544 --> 1:08:59.382
What do you want?
- Want to go for a drive?

1:09:01.175 --> 1:09:03.175
I don't know.

1:09:04.261 --> 1:09:06.261
Get in, Baby.

1:09:28.121 --> 1:09:30.121
Come here.

1:10:12.082 --> 1:10:15.754
Why don't you like me?
- I do like you.

1:10:16.588 --> 1:10:18.588
How much?

1:11:27.161 --> 1:11:29.161
Oh, Pete.

1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.920
Sheila.

1:11:38.298 --> 1:11:40.298
Sheila.

1:12:22.511 --> 1:12:24.511
What'd you change it for?

1:12:25.431 --> 1:12:27.431
I like that.

1:12:27.933 --> 1:12:29.933
Well, I don't.

1:12:39.196 --> 1:12:41.196
I like that.

1:13:15.900 --> 1:13:18.940
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

1:13:19.028 --> 1:13:21.291
Think you'll get a chance to
give her the once-over today?

1:13:21.391 --> 1:13:22.391
Sure.

1:13:22.491 --> 1:13:26.020
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.732
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

1:13:29.832 --> 1:13:33.502
It'll be done.
- You're my man, Pete.

1:15:20.948 --> 1:15:24.786
Don't let that thing upset you.

1:15:50.755 --> 1:15:53.759
Holy smokes.

1:16:20.494 --> 1:16:22.494
Hey.

1:16:23.914 --> 1:16:25.914
I'm Alice Wakefield.

1:16:26.375 --> 1:16:28.375
Pete Dayton.

1:16:29.963 --> 1:16:33.216
I was here earlier.
- Yeah, I remember.

1:16:40.391 --> 1:16:43.271
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

1:16:44.645 --> 1:16:46.645
I don't know.

1:16:52.403 --> 1:16:54.403
OK.

1:16:55.114 --> 1:16:57.594
Why don't I take you to dinner?

1:17:00.077 --> 1:17:04.166
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

1:17:11.799 --> 1:17:13.799
Do you have a phone?

1:17:16.470 --> 1:17:18.470
Yeah.

1:17:18.514 --> 1:17:20.914
It's right...lt's right there.

1:17:21.517 --> 1:17:24.317
I have to call myself another taxi.

1:17:34.864 --> 1:17:36.864
Hello? Van Nuys?

1:17:37.283 --> 1:17:41.120
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

1:17:54.718 --> 1:17:59.624
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

1:17:59.724 --> 1:18:02.864
Hello. Yeah, we're not
going to need that cab.

1:18:02.964 --> 1:18:04.964
Thanks.

1:18:19.954 --> 1:18:22.957
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

1:18:56.533 --> 1:18:58.533
Take my clothes off.

1:19:02.247 --> 1:19:05.607
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

1:19:56.221 --> 1:19:59.224
I want more.
- Me, too.

1:20:03.746 --> 1:20:05.086
Can I call you?

1:20:05.186 --> 1:20:09.586
Yeah. Call me at home.
I'll give you the number.

1:20:16.050 --> 1:20:18.050
OK, Baby.

1:20:45.581 --> 1:20:50.796
Hey. Up here. Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

1:21:25.581 --> 1:21:28.377
I'll get it.
Hello?

1:21:29.293 --> 1:21:32.463
Meow, meow. It's me.

1:21:32.713 --> 1:21:34.713
Hey, Baby.

1:21:35.759 --> 1:21:38.470
I can't see you tonight.

1:21:41.932 --> 1:21:43.932
OK.

1:21:44.810 --> 1:21:47.770
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

1:21:48.314 --> 1:21:50.314
Sure.

1:21:51.776 --> 1:21:56.906
I think he suspects something.
We have to be careful.

1:21:59.993 --> 1:22:01.993
I miss you.

1:22:05.541 --> 1:22:07.541
Pete?

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:09.960
Me, too.

1:22:11.212 --> 1:22:13.257
I'll call you again.

1:23:51.818 --> 1:23:53.818
What a fucking job.

1:23:54.280 --> 1:23:56.280
His or ours, Lou?

1:23:58.032 --> 1:24:00.032
Ours, Hank.

1:24:24.686 --> 1:24:27.230
Hey.
- Sit down a minute.

1:24:28.190 --> 1:24:30.859
What's up?
- Sit down.

1:24:33.528 --> 1:24:35.528
You don't look so good.

1:24:35.865 --> 1:24:39.117
No, I just...just have a headache.

1:24:40.578 --> 1:24:42.578
What's going on?

1:24:43.790 --> 1:24:45.790
The police called us.

1:24:47.919 --> 1:24:48.987
What'd they want?

1:24:49.087 --> 1:24:51.821
They want to know if we had a chance...

1:24:51.921 --> 1:24:55.368
...to find out what happened
to you the other night.

1:24:55.468 --> 1:24:59.308
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

1:25:02.559 --> 1:25:04.959
But I don't remember anything.

1:25:06.605 --> 1:25:08.899
What'd you tell them?

1:25:14.446 --> 1:25:17.166
We're not going to say anything...

1:25:17.282 --> 1:25:20.002
...about that night to the police.

1:25:22.539 --> 1:25:24.916
We saw you that night, Pete.

1:25:28.378 --> 1:25:31.418
You came home with your friend Sheila.

1:25:33.008 --> 1:25:35.008
Sheila?

1:25:37.178 --> 1:25:39.723
Yeah. There was a man with you.

1:25:40.765 --> 1:25:45.085
What is this? I mean, why
didn't you tell me anything?

1:25:49.900 --> 1:25:51.900
Who's the man?

1:25:53.028 --> 1:25:56.365
I've never seen him before in my life.

1:26:01.830 --> 1:26:03.830
What happened to me?

1:26:06.543 --> 1:26:09.796
Please, please, Dad, Tell me.

1:26:28.649 --> 1:26:30.649
Hey, Pete. Hey.

1:26:31.235 --> 1:26:33.235
Hey.

1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:45.901
Hey.

1:26:46.001 --> 1:26:48.001
Mr. Eddy.

1:26:57.638 --> 1:26:59.765
Hey, Pete.

1:27:00.682 --> 1:27:02.726
How you doing?
- I'm OK.

1:27:02.936 --> 1:27:06.089
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

1:27:06.189 --> 1:27:09.549
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

1:27:10.317 --> 1:27:15.115
Her name is Alice. I swear,
I love that girl to death.

1:27:17.743 --> 1:27:22.063
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

1:27:24.458 --> 1:27:26.458
I'd take this...

1:27:26.585 --> 1:27:30.864
...and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

1:27:30.964 --> 1:27:34.385
And then you know what I'd do?
- What?

1:27:35.262 --> 1:27:38.097
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

1:27:45.230 --> 1:27:49.276
Hey. You're looking good.

1:27:50.317 --> 1:27:52.317
What you been up to?

1:28:02.038 --> 1:28:04.038
I'll get it.

1:28:05.292 --> 1:28:07.292
Hello?

1:28:08.212 --> 1:28:14.718
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

1:28:20.266 --> 1:28:22.266
He'll kill us.

1:28:25.354 --> 1:28:27.354
Are you...

1:28:29.276 --> 1:28:31.178
...positive that he knows?

1:28:31.278 --> 1:28:34.281
I'm not positive, but he knows.

1:28:36.867 --> 1:28:42.706
So...What are we supposed to do?

1:28:45.751 --> 1:28:47.751
I don't know.

1:29:18.369 --> 1:29:23.708
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

1:29:28.296 --> 1:29:30.296
I know a guy.

1:29:32.551 --> 1:29:35.804
He pays girls to party with him.

1:29:36.512 --> 1:29:38.912
He's always got a lot of cash.

1:29:39.891 --> 1:29:41.891
He'd be easy to rob.

1:29:43.311 --> 1:29:47.942
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

1:29:49.944 --> 1:29:52.238
We could be together.

1:30:00.788 --> 1:30:02.868
Have you partied with him?

1:30:09.130 --> 1:30:11.130
Did you like it?

1:30:12.675 --> 1:30:14.675
No.

1:30:14.761 --> 1:30:16.761
It was part of the deal.

1:30:17.473 --> 1:30:19.473
What deal?

1:30:22.853 --> 1:30:25.398
He works for Mr. Eddy.
- Yeah?

1:30:26.190 --> 1:30:29.950
And what's he do?
- He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

1:30:30.194 --> 1:30:33.531
Pornos?
- Yeah.

1:30:34.657 --> 1:30:37.310
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

1:30:37.410 --> 1:30:41.410
Pete...
- No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

1:30:46.002 --> 1:30:48.129
It was a long time ago.

1:30:49.881 --> 1:30:54.521
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

1:30:55.763 --> 1:30:57.807
He told me about a job.

1:31:03.187 --> 1:31:05.187
In pornos?

1:31:07.734 --> 1:31:12.947
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

1:31:15.992 --> 1:31:19.662
He made an appointment
for me to see a man.

1:31:20.747 --> 1:31:22.747
I went to this place.

1:31:25.001 --> 1:31:27.561
They made me wait there forever.

1:31:29.382 --> 1:31:32.102
There was a guy guarding the door.

1:31:36.264 --> 1:31:40.824
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

1:31:46.357 --> 1:31:48.437
I started getting nervous.

1:31:50.653 --> 1:31:53.114
When it got dark...

1:31:54.282 --> 1:31:57.535
...they brought me into this other room.

1:34:21.045 --> 1:34:23.506
Why didn't you just leave?

1:34:31.764 --> 1:34:33.975
You liked it, huh?

1:34:37.605 --> 1:34:43.068
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

1:34:48.616 --> 1:34:50.856
I don't want you to go away.

1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:53.900
I don't want you to go away.

1:35:03.881 --> 1:35:05.881
I love you, Alice.

1:35:10.055 --> 1:35:12.599
Should I call Andy?
- Andy?

1:35:14.518 --> 1:35:18.118
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

1:35:18.522 --> 1:35:21.274
Yeah. Call him.

1:35:24.152 --> 1:35:26.872
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

1:35:27.031 --> 1:35:29.751
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

1:35:29.825 --> 1:35:34.622
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

1:35:35.331 --> 1:35:41.504
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

1:35:41.713 --> 1:35:44.867
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

1:35:44.967 --> 1:35:49.763
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

1:35:50.138 --> 1:35:54.127
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

1:35:54.227 --> 1:35:58.523
At 11:15, I'll send Andy
down to fix me a drink.

1:35:58.730 --> 1:36:02.490
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

1:36:06.489 --> 1:36:08.489
OK.

1:36:37.313 --> 1:36:40.132
You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
- Sheila.

1:36:40.232 --> 1:36:42.719
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila. Sheila, stop it.

1:36:42.819 --> 1:36:45.138
You don't call. Who is she?
- Stop it.

1:36:45.238 --> 1:36:47.245
What's the bitch's name?
- I'm sorry.

1:36:47.345 --> 1:36:48.308
Oh, you're sorry?

1:36:48.408 --> 1:36:49.469
Go home.
- You're sorry?

1:36:49.569 --> 1:36:50.185
Sheila, stop it.

1:36:50.285 --> 1:36:52.437
You're sorry, you piece of shit.

1:36:52.537 --> 1:36:54.106
You're sorry?
- Go home.

1:36:54.206 --> 1:36:55.678
Fuck you...Fuck you.
- Sheila, stop, Sheila.

1:36:55.778 --> 1:36:56.525
Fuck you... Fuck you.

1:36:56.625 --> 1:36:59.403
Fuck you...Fuck you.
- Sheila...Sheila.

1:36:59.503 --> 1:37:03.743
Sheila. Let's both go in
and talk about this quietly.

1:37:04.132 --> 1:37:06.132
Sheila, come on.

1:37:08.179 --> 1:37:10.473
You are different.
- Sheila.

1:37:10.806 --> 1:37:13.100
Tell him...Tell him.

1:37:13.309 --> 1:37:16.145
Sheila, don't. Don't.

1:37:17.605 --> 1:37:24.571
I don't care anymore anyway.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

1:37:25.155 --> 1:37:31.244
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

1:37:45.926 --> 1:37:47.926
Pete?

1:37:50.055 --> 1:37:52.215
There's a man on the phone.

1:37:52.976 --> 1:37:56.016
He's called a couple of times tonight.

1:37:56.229 --> 1:37:58.229
Who is it?

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.440
He won't give his name.

1:38:20.297 --> 1:38:22.114
Hello?

1:38:22.214 --> 1:38:24.758
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

1:38:27.094 --> 1:38:31.391
Who is this?
- You know who it is.

1:38:34.895 --> 1:38:36.895
Mr. Eddy?

1:38:37.229 --> 1:38:40.234
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

1:38:41.026 --> 1:38:44.947
OK.
- You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

1:38:46.949 --> 1:38:53.289
Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
- I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

1:38:55.499 --> 1:39:00.405
You're sure you're OK?
Everything all right?

1:39:00.505 --> 1:39:02.505
Yeah.

1:39:03.549 --> 1:39:07.789
I'm really glad to know
you're doing good, Pete. Hey.

1:39:08.095 --> 1:39:11.215
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

1:39:15.729 --> 1:39:18.273
We've met before, haven't we?

1:39:19.733 --> 1:39:21.733
I don't think so.

1:39:23.362 --> 1:39:25.639
Where is it you think we've met?

1:39:25.739 --> 1:39:29.660
At your house. Don't you remember?

1:39:33.414 --> 1:39:37.335
No. No, I don't.

1:39:38.795 --> 1:39:41.589
In the East, the far East...

1:39:41.798 --> 1:39:44.470
...when a person is sentenced to death,

1:39:44.570 --> 1:39:47.871
they're sent to a place
where they can't escape.

1:39:47.971 --> 1:39:52.585
Never knowing when an executioner
may step up behind them...

1:39:52.685 --> 1:39:56.337
...and fire a bullet into
the back of their head.

1:39:56.437 --> 1:39:58.437
What's going on?

1:39:58.899 --> 1:40:01.779
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

1:40:02.486 --> 1:40:08.886
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

1:43:23.339 --> 1:43:25.339
You got him.

1:43:25.716 --> 1:43:27.716
Alice.

1:44:24.194 --> 1:44:26.194
Wow.

1:44:28.824 --> 1:44:30.824
We killed him.

1:44:39.628 --> 1:44:41.755
You killed him.

1:44:44.882 --> 1:44:46.882
Alice?

1:44:51.348 --> 1:44:53.348
Alice?

1:44:54.059 --> 1:44:56.059
What do we do?

1:44:57.021 --> 1:44:59.021
What do we do?

1:45:00.024 --> 1:45:02.024
We have to get the stuff.

1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:06.480
We have to get out of here.

1:45:21.587 --> 1:45:23.587
Ah, fuck.

1:45:59.210 --> 1:46:01.210
Is that you?

1:46:01.921 --> 1:46:03.921
Are both of them you?

1:46:13.100 --> 1:46:15.100
That's me.

1:46:17.188 --> 1:46:19.649
Honey, are you all right?

1:46:24.696 --> 1:46:26.696
Where's the bathroom?

1:46:27.740 --> 1:46:30.619
It's upstairs, down the hall.

1:47:28.179 --> 1:47:30.339
Did you want to talk to me?

1:47:32.934 --> 1:47:35.937
Did you want to ask me, why?

1:48:33.873 --> 1:48:35.873
What's the matter?

1:48:38.794 --> 1:48:40.794
Don't you trust me, Pete?

1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:51.308
Stick this in your pants.

1:48:58.648 --> 1:49:00.944
I know a fence.

1:49:03.612 --> 1:49:09.132
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit...

1:49:09.326 --> 1:49:11.326
...and Andy's car...

1:49:12.037 --> 1:49:14.791
And then we can go anywhere.

1:49:29.982 --> 1:49:31.982
Come on, Baby.

1:49:47.833 --> 1:49:49.833
Pete, you drive.

1:50:04.935 --> 1:50:07.735
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

1:50:10.107 --> 1:50:12.347
Where the fuck are we going?

1:50:14.988 --> 1:50:17.708
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

1:50:19.742 --> 1:50:22.203
The fence I told you about...

1:50:26.207 --> 1:50:28.207
He's at his cabin.

1:51:41.779 --> 1:51:43.779
Come on.

1:52:30.788 --> 1:52:32.788
We'll have to wait.

1:52:53.687 --> 1:52:56.398
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

1:53:04.198 --> 1:53:06.998
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

1:53:10.246 --> 1:53:12.374
More than ever.

1:55:13.709 --> 1:55:15.709
I want you.

1:55:24.011 --> 1:55:26.011
I want you.

1:55:43.907 --> 1:55:45.907
I want you.

1:55:47.077 --> 1:55:49.077
I want you.

1:56:07.298 --> 1:56:11.470
You'll never have me.

1:57:16.287 --> 1:57:18.287
Here I am.

1:58:09.010 --> 1:58:15.350
Where's Alice?
- Alice who? Her name is Renee.

1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:19.360
If she told you her name
is Alice, she's lying.

1:58:23.483 --> 1:58:27.737
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?.

2:01:50.275 --> 2:01:52.275
Renee?

2:02:01.369 --> 2:02:03.456
You're coming with me.

2:04:06.293 --> 2:04:09.004
What do you guys want?

2:05:24.082 --> 2:05:26.082
Now you can hand it back.

2:05:35.846 --> 2:05:38.055
You and me, Mister...

2:05:41.225 --> 2:05:45.272
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

2:05:46.230 --> 2:05:48.230
Can't we?

2:06:43.659 --> 2:06:46.119
Ed...Take a look at this.

2:06:53.085 --> 2:06:55.245
Yeah. That's her all right.

2:06:56.463 --> 2:07:00.063
That's Fred Madison's
wife with Dick Laurent.

2:07:00.384 --> 2:07:02.704
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

2:07:03.971 --> 2:07:07.375
We got Pete Dayton's prints
all over this place.

2:07:07.475 --> 2:07:09.555
You know what I think, Ed?

2:07:11.103 --> 2:07:13.823
What is it, AI? What do you think?

2:07:14.482 --> 2:07:18.562
I think there's no such
thing as a bad coincidence.

2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:22.760
Dick Laurent is dead.
