<i>This week on</i> Vice:

00:09.303 --> 00:12.504
<i>Indonesia's internal
struggle over Sharia.</i>

00:21.115 --> 00:23.682
Suroosh Alvi: <i>This is the
Sharia police division.</i>

00:23.718 --> 00:24.850
<i>We're about to go
on patrol with them,</i>

00:24.885 --> 00:28.086
<i>as they make sure people
are abiding by Islamic law.</i>

00:28.122 --> 00:30.155
Smith:
<i>And then, the monumental effort</i>

00:30.190 --> 00:32.458
<i>to clean up the plastic
in our ocean.</i>

00:32.493 --> 00:35.393
This is the very first time
that the Ocean Cleanup guys

00:35.428 --> 00:37.362
have had their product
actually in the water.

00:37.397 --> 00:39.297
What we're seeing here
is just one segment,

00:39.332 --> 00:42.500
and eventually, the thing will be about
a thousand times larger than this.

00:42.535 --> 00:45.937
We're finding plastic
in Antarctic species.

00:45.973 --> 00:47.973
<i>So, this is really
a global issue.</i>

00:54.847 --> 00:56.180
Yeung:
Go! Go! Go!

00:59.085 --> 01:00.285
Refugee:
We are not animals!

01:00.320 --> 01:10.751
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

01:11.664 --> 01:15.499
Sharia is a strict code of
Islamic law based on the Quran,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.001
which has been in
the news a lot lately

01:17.036 --> 01:20.237
<i>because it's the underlying
philosophy of ISIS,</i>

01:20.273 --> 01:22.139
<i>who believe that all
countries in the world</i>

01:22.175 --> 01:24.441
<i>should practice this
type of governance.</i>

01:24.476 --> 01:28.345
But adherence to Sharia has also been
gaining ground in other countries.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.581
<i>Indonesia, the most populous
Muslim country in the world,</i>

01:31.617 --> 01:33.983
<i>usually known for its
moderate brand of Islam,</i>

01:34.019 --> 01:36.353
<i>is now experimenting with Sharia</i>

01:36.388 --> 01:38.188
<i>in the province of Aceh.</i>

01:38.223 --> 01:41.157
Suroosh Alvi went
to Indonesia to investigate.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.973
Alvi: So, it's Wednesday
night in Aceh.

01:58.008 --> 02:01.377
This is the Sharia police
division behind me,

02:01.412 --> 02:04.714
and we're about to go on patrol
with them as they go around town

02:04.749 --> 02:07.550
and make sure people
are abiding by Islamic law.

02:11.055 --> 02:13.456
If they see couples
that are just sitting together,

02:13.491 --> 02:17.059
they'll talk to them, make sure
that they are a married couple.

02:17.094 --> 02:19.895
So everybody is getting on their
motorcycles and running away.

02:22.266 --> 02:23.899
The buzzkill division.

02:23.934 --> 02:26.101
Sharia police...

02:26.136 --> 02:28.237
killing good vibes.

02:28.272 --> 02:30.239
Alvi: <i>The strict
Islamic code of Sharia</i>

02:30.274 --> 02:34.075
<i>is most common in countries
such as Saudi Arabia and Iran,</i>

02:34.110 --> 02:36.878
<i>but now it's taking root
in parts of Indonesia,</i>

02:36.913 --> 02:39.981
<i>a historically secular country.</i>

02:40.016 --> 02:42.584
<i>Previously common
practices like socializing</i>

02:42.619 --> 02:44.619
<i>between unmarried men and women,</i>

02:44.654 --> 02:48.055
<i>drinking alcohol, or even
wearing Western clothing,</i>

02:48.091 --> 02:50.457
<i>are violations of the law.</i>

02:50.493 --> 02:53.627
<i>Unfortunately, this
interpretation of Sharia</i>

02:53.662 --> 02:56.297
<i>targets some communities
more than others.</i>

02:56.332 --> 02:58.299
Alvi: We've read a lot about

02:58.334 --> 03:00.301
the Sharia police going after

03:00.336 --> 03:02.736
gay couples,
and people having gay sex.

03:02.772 --> 03:05.372
How do you actually patrol?

03:20.322 --> 03:23.623
Alvi: <i>Prejudice against
Aceh's LGBTQ population,</i>

03:23.658 --> 03:25.491
<i>already widespread
in the region,</i>

03:25.527 --> 03:27.560
<i>has now effectively
become state-sanctioned.</i>

03:27.595 --> 03:31.631
<i>These two teens were arrested
for homosexual behavior</i>

03:31.666 --> 03:34.434
<i>and agreed to speak to us
about life under Sharia.</i>

03:34.469 --> 03:37.937
What is life for you
like here in Aceh?

03:48.450 --> 03:50.616
The Indonesian Ulama Council

03:50.652 --> 03:54.019
released a fatwa against
the LGBT community

03:54.055 --> 03:58.424
proposing punishments
ranging from a hundred canings

03:58.459 --> 04:00.492
to the death penalty

04:00.527 --> 04:03.963
for individuals accused
of homosexual acts.

04:15.943 --> 04:18.343
Alvi: <i>While the death penalty
has only been proposed</i>

04:18.378 --> 04:19.978
<i>by Aceh's most
extreme hardliners,</i>

04:20.012 --> 04:22.881
<i>those caught
violating Sharia law</i>

04:22.916 --> 04:25.784
<i>face harsh and very
public repercussions.</i>

04:25.819 --> 04:27.918
Alvi:
Why are you here?

04:27.954 --> 04:29.753
Why did they
put you in this cell?

04:34.327 --> 04:36.727
Are they gonna punish you

04:36.762 --> 04:39.063
by caning you,
in front of everyone?

04:44.737 --> 04:46.303
Alvi: <i>These taxi
drivers were jailed</i>

04:46.338 --> 04:48.338
<i>for nearly a month
for violating Sharia,</i>

04:48.374 --> 04:52.610
<i>awaiting the same fate that people
across Aceh are becoming accustomed to.</i>

05:28.613 --> 05:30.914
Alvi: <i>But even the
executioners of Sharia law</i>

05:30.949 --> 05:32.581
<i>have mixed feelings about it.</i>

05:34.118 --> 05:35.918
You're a moral enforcer.

05:35.953 --> 05:39.021
Do you see this job as an honor?

05:50.901 --> 05:52.834
Alvi: <i>The call for
enforcement of Sharia</i>

05:52.870 --> 05:54.870
<i>is actually relatively
new to Aceh,</i>

05:54.905 --> 05:58.907
<i>and was amplified in the wake of one
of the deadliest natural disasters</i>

05:58.943 --> 06:00.742
<i>in recorded history,</i>

06:00.778 --> 06:03.545
<i>which many here interpreted
as a religious reckoning.</i>

06:03.581 --> 06:07.115
Alvi: We're standing in front
of the grand mosque in Aceh,

06:07.150 --> 06:09.784
which was built
in the late 1800s.

06:09.819 --> 06:13.621
When the tsunami
happened in 2004,

06:13.656 --> 06:18.126
<i>everything was destroyed
around the mosque for miles,</i>

06:18.161 --> 06:21.563
<i>and this is one of the only
structures that survived.</i>

06:21.598 --> 06:24.865
And this event
was a turning point

06:24.901 --> 06:27.902
in terms of the evolution
of Sharia in Aceh.

06:27.937 --> 06:31.839
Alvi: <i>The tsunami killed
over 230,000 people</i>

06:31.874 --> 06:34.842
<i>but also forced the end
of a decades-long civil war</i>

06:34.877 --> 06:36.343
<i>between Aceh separatists</i>

06:36.378 --> 06:38.678
<i>and the Indonesian
central government.</i>

06:38.714 --> 06:42.516
<i>Aceh was given partial autonomy
as part of a peace agreement,</i>

06:42.551 --> 06:46.487
<i>allowing them to enforce Sharia
as the law of the land.</i>

06:46.522 --> 06:49.089
<i>Syahrizal Abbas was instrumental</i>

06:49.125 --> 06:51.358
<i>in upholding Sharia in Aceh</i>

06:51.393 --> 06:53.760
<i>and explained
its evolution to us.</i>

07:23.391 --> 07:24.923
Alvi:
<i>Abbas and fellow hardliners</i>

07:24.959 --> 07:26.792
<i>believe the tsunami
was the wrath of God,</i>

07:26.827 --> 07:31.130
<i>punishing the people
of Aceh for living in sin,</i>

07:31.165 --> 07:32.898
<i>and that the way
to fix their society</i>

07:32.933 --> 07:35.534
<i>was through punishment
for these moral crimes.</i>

07:35.569 --> 07:38.503
So, if you're caught
having gay sex,

07:38.539 --> 07:41.573
you could get caned
up to a hundred times?

07:41.608 --> 07:42.675
Mm-hmm.

07:42.710 --> 07:44.309
That seems a little extreme, no?

07:45.312 --> 07:47.279
Yeah, uh...

08:06.666 --> 08:08.332
Really?

08:12.772 --> 08:16.440
Does it appear that
the behavior is being modified

08:16.475 --> 08:18.875
of the population by the
implementation of caning?

08:25.484 --> 08:27.784
Alvi: <i>As the citizens
of Aceh find themselves</i>

08:27.820 --> 08:29.953
<i>increasingly under this control,</i>

08:29.988 --> 08:33.090
<i>Sharia may be gaining traction
in the rest of Indonesia,</i>

08:33.125 --> 08:36.058
<i>as a recent poll found up
to 72 percent</i>

08:36.095 --> 08:39.429
<i>of Indonesian Muslims
support Sharia law.</i>

08:39.464 --> 08:41.464
<i>And with a recent
surge in attacks</i>

08:41.499 --> 08:43.633
<i>targeting minority
Buddhists and Christians,</i>

08:43.668 --> 08:45.468
<i>there's a growing fear</i>

08:45.503 --> 08:48.504
<i>that as Sharia gains strength
in the Indonesian capital,</i>

08:48.540 --> 08:52.508
<i>the country's long-standing
legacy of secularism is at risk.</i>

08:52.544 --> 08:54.410
<i>In the capital of Jakarta,</i>

08:54.446 --> 08:57.614
<i>we spoke to Islamic
preacher Syamsudin Uba</i>

08:57.649 --> 09:00.283
<i>about why he supports
the spread of Sharia.</i>

09:00.318 --> 09:03.152
We just spent a few days in Aceh

09:03.187 --> 09:06.556
to look at the Sharia system
that they have there.

09:06.591 --> 09:12.594
What is your view on the Sharia system
that they have implemented in Aceh?

09:39.089 --> 09:41.489
What was the last thing you said?

09:51.835 --> 09:54.702
Alvi: <i>To clarify what I thought
he meant by Syria and Iraq,</i>

09:54.737 --> 09:58.071
<i>I asked him about some
cities that until now</i>

09:58.107 --> 10:01.141
<i>had been exclusively
controlled by ISIS.</i>

10:01.177 --> 10:03.678
Are you referring
to the Sharia that is

10:03.713 --> 10:05.579
<i>in Ramadi and Mosul in Iraq,</i>

10:05.615 --> 10:07.648
<i>and in Raqqa in Syria?</i>

10:07.684 --> 10:09.850
<i>Are those the cities that
you're talking about?</i>

10:25.534 --> 10:26.800
May I see?

10:26.836 --> 10:28.035
Yikes.

10:29.104 --> 10:30.136
What does it say?

10:35.844 --> 10:38.144
I said "Islamic Caliphate"
and then...

10:38.179 --> 10:40.680
Good timing.

10:40.716 --> 10:42.915
Alvi: <i>And this isn't the first
time that he's pledged support</i>

10:42.951 --> 10:45.352
<i>for Al-Baghdadi,
the leader of ISIS.</i>

10:45.387 --> 10:47.553
<i>In March of 2014,</i>

10:47.588 --> 10:49.755
<i>the preacher led a rally
of hundreds of people</i>

10:49.790 --> 10:52.291
<i>encouraging them
to join the Islamic State.</i>

10:59.033 --> 11:01.334
Alvi: <i>And he was arrested
and briefly detained</i>

11:01.369 --> 11:04.403
<i>for publicly promoting
ISIS in 2015.</i>

11:04.438 --> 11:07.172
What you're preaching
is that there should be

11:07.207 --> 11:12.511
the establishment of an Islamic
caliphate in Indonesia

11:12.546 --> 11:16.248
in which the leader
will be Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi.

12:05.831 --> 12:08.965
Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi
is leader of an organization

12:09.000 --> 12:12.001
that perpetrated
attacks in Paris,

12:12.037 --> 12:13.503
<i>California.</i>

12:13.539 --> 12:17.507
Baghdadi's organization
is responsible

12:17.543 --> 12:20.076
<i>for countless atrocities</i>

12:20.111 --> 12:22.546
<i>and violations of human rights,</i>

12:22.581 --> 12:24.180
<i>and death, and rape,</i>

12:24.215 --> 12:26.282
and lots of bad... shit.

12:26.318 --> 12:29.385
So, I'm having trouble
reconciling your pitch.

13:04.621 --> 13:06.989
Don't you think
what you're preaching

13:07.024 --> 13:09.257
is creating
a psychological environment

13:09.293 --> 13:13.862
that makes it very easy
to take that next step

13:13.897 --> 13:17.765
and to pick up a gun,
and... and fight?

13:41.357 --> 13:43.924
Alvi: <i>While Uba maintains
that his messaging is</i>

13:43.959 --> 13:47.428
<i>that Indonesians should not
engage in violence or radicalism,</i>

13:47.463 --> 13:51.164
<i>hundreds of Indonesians have left the
country to join ISIS in Syria...</i>

13:53.602 --> 13:57.170
<i>and ISIS attacks have recently
struck very close to home.</i>

13:58.674 --> 14:02.009
<i>And as the Indonesian government
attempts to stop further attacks,</i>

14:02.044 --> 14:03.777
<i>along with ISIS
recruitment attempts,</i>

14:03.812 --> 14:06.913
<i>it's clear that there's
a battle for hearts and minds</i>

14:06.948 --> 14:09.849
<i>raging in the world's most
populous Muslim country,</i>

14:09.884 --> 14:11.518
<i>with extremists like Uba</i>

14:11.553 --> 14:14.421
<i>opposing activists
like Alissa Wahid,</i>

14:14.456 --> 14:16.389
<i>the daughter of Indonesia's
former president,</i>

14:16.425 --> 14:20.760
<i>who is fighting for the secular
ideals Indonesia was founded on.</i>

14:21.596 --> 14:25.330
Does the existence
of a Sharia state

14:25.366 --> 14:27.433
create an environment
of religious intolerance?

14:27.468 --> 14:31.270
The Sharia should live
in the personal

14:31.305 --> 14:34.073
and everyday life of a Muslim.

14:34.108 --> 14:36.642
It should not be formalized.

14:36.678 --> 14:39.711
<i>Because the fundamental of Islam</i>

14:39.746 --> 14:43.348
<i>is belief that God
creates people</i>

14:43.384 --> 14:47.619
from different types, from different
background to help each other.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.389
We're the fundamentalists,
not them.

14:50.424 --> 14:51.623
They're the extremists.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.564
One of Vice's first-ever
documentaries

14:59.600 --> 15:01.967
<i>focused on the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch,</i>

15:02.002 --> 15:05.704
<i>an enormous mass of plastic
swirling in the Pacific Ocean</i>

15:05.739 --> 15:09.941
<i>that some have estimated to be
larger than the state of Texas.</i>

15:09.977 --> 15:12.577
Now, what we found
was tons of discarded plastic

15:12.612 --> 15:15.879
breaking down into a mix
of debris and chemical sludge.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.215
Thomas Morton:
<i>We're nowhere near land.</i>

15:17.250 --> 15:19.016
We're nowhere near
any other ships.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.986
<i>We've changed the
composition of ocean water</i>

15:22.021 --> 15:24.088
<i>almost a thousand miles
from shore.</i>

15:24.124 --> 15:25.889
Smith: <i>It's always
been</i> Vice's <i> mission</i>

15:25.925 --> 15:29.526
to keep following the issues even
after they fade from the news cycle.

15:29.561 --> 15:33.797
<i>And today there are some major
new developments in this story.</i>

15:33.833 --> 15:35.198
<i>So we sent Isobel Yeung</i>

15:35.234 --> 15:37.835
<i>to see if there might finally
be some workable solutions</i>

15:37.870 --> 15:40.170
for saving the world's oceans.

15:54.853 --> 15:56.286
Yeung:
We are just driving

15:56.321 --> 16:00.723
towards the very southern tip
of Hawaii's big island,

16:00.759 --> 16:04.694
which, not so long ago,
was an absolute paradise.

16:07.431 --> 16:12.201
<i>But this one-time paradise has become
a magnet for the ocean's plastic.</i>

16:20.744 --> 16:23.179
All you can see
as far as the horizon

16:23.214 --> 16:25.614
is the remains of human refuse.

16:25.650 --> 16:29.652
This could be from Asia, it could
be from the mainland, America,

16:29.687 --> 16:34.322
and a lot of this stuff comes from
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

16:34.357 --> 16:37.525
Yeung: <i>The Garbage Patch, also
known as the North Pacific Gyre,</i>

16:37.561 --> 16:39.161
<i>is where ocean currents converge</i>

16:39.196 --> 16:41.663
<i>to create a concentration
of plastics.</i>

16:41.699 --> 16:43.231
<i>A lot of the plastic
at Kamilo Beach</i>

16:43.266 --> 16:45.867
<i>has been circulating
in the ocean for so long</i>

16:45.903 --> 16:50.037
<i>it's been broken down into tiny
particles, or micro-plastics.</i>

16:50.073 --> 16:52.006
<i>Which are nearly
impossible to clean up.</i>

16:55.712 --> 16:57.679
How frequently do you do
these beach clean-ups?

16:57.714 --> 17:00.047
You know, we've done
32 so far this year.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.883
<i>We're gonna pick this stuff up and
come back down here next week,</i>

17:02.919 --> 17:05.686
and it could potentially be
just as dirty, if not worse.

17:07.223 --> 17:09.990
Yeung: <i>This plastic doesn't
just ruin a day at the beach.</i>

17:11.327 --> 17:14.060
<i>It's estimated that
nearly 700 marine species</i>

17:14.097 --> 17:16.530
<i>have encountered
man-made debris.</i>

17:19.667 --> 17:21.801
<i>At Hawaii's Oceanic Institute</i>

17:21.838 --> 17:24.371
<i>Dr. David Hyrenbach
is studying how plastic</i>

17:24.406 --> 17:26.973
<i>is becoming a permanent
part of our ecosystem.</i>

17:27.008 --> 17:30.944
So this bird was incidentally
killed... Whoa, that is a beast!

17:30.979 --> 17:33.447
- Then you see the hooks coming
out of the neck there. Oh.

17:33.482 --> 17:37.183
This is the gizzard.
so the heart's out of the way.

17:37.219 --> 17:38.685
Let me just...

17:38.721 --> 17:40.586
I see some plastic!

17:40.622 --> 17:44.023
- Whoa. Look at that.
- Okay.

17:44.059 --> 17:47.426
Yeung: <i>A 2015 study predicted
that as many as 90 percent</i>

17:47.462 --> 17:49.095
<i>of all seabirds worldwide</i>

17:49.131 --> 17:52.232
<i>now consume plastic
as part of their diet.</i>

17:52.267 --> 17:54.734
How far do you think most of
this plastic has traveled from?

17:54.770 --> 17:55.801
It could be coming
from anywhere.

17:55.836 --> 17:59.272
<i>I mean, we're finding
plastic in Antarctic species.</i>

17:59.307 --> 18:01.407
You know, places where
people don't really go.

18:01.442 --> 18:04.277
So this is really
a global issue.

18:04.312 --> 18:06.679
Yeung: <i>And it's not just
birds eating this plastic.</i>

18:07.548 --> 18:09.282
<i>Oceanographer
Dr. Anela Choy</i>

18:09.317 --> 18:12.951
<i>is studying the plastics impact
on the entire ocean food chain.</i>

18:12.987 --> 18:14.419
This is a lancetfish,

18:14.454 --> 18:17.956
and what's great about these guys is
they sample the environment for us.

18:17.992 --> 18:21.626
So, we sample the stomachs from
different locations in the ocean

18:21.662 --> 18:24.863
um, take a look at what...
what they're feeding on.

18:24.899 --> 18:27.966
Whoa! Look what we have here.
Whoa! Wow.

18:28.002 --> 18:31.569
What the hell is that? That's
a giant piece of plastic.

18:31.605 --> 18:32.804
Oh, God.

18:32.839 --> 18:35.873
These pieces of plastic
are made out of petroleum

18:35.909 --> 18:37.141
and other chemical contaminants.

18:37.177 --> 18:39.577
When pieces of plastic
are in the water column,

18:39.613 --> 18:41.913
they sort of act
as little sponges.

18:41.948 --> 18:44.081
They actually accumulate toxins,

18:44.117 --> 18:47.084
and then they get
ingested by animals,

18:47.120 --> 18:50.387
and so, we're still learning about
the chemistry of what happens

18:50.423 --> 18:51.956
when fish like that eats it.

18:51.991 --> 18:54.859
How out of hand
is this situation getting?

18:54.894 --> 18:58.262
Animals at almost every single
trophic level of the food web

18:58.298 --> 19:00.331
in the open ocean
are ingesting plastics.

19:00.366 --> 19:02.733
Yeah, it's the biggest
habitat on the planet.

19:02.768 --> 19:06.102
- Mm-hmm. And if there's plastic
throughout that habitat,

19:06.138 --> 19:08.839
it's gonna have some
really serious impacts.

19:08.874 --> 19:12.876
Yeung: <i>Many of the species
humans eat prey on lancetfish.</i>

19:12.911 --> 19:15.912
<i>Meaning plastic is likely finding
its way up the food chain</i>

19:15.948 --> 19:19.249
<i>and into our dinners.</i>

19:19.284 --> 19:22.719
Are you worried that any of that plastic
might find its way into the fish?

19:22.754 --> 19:23.920
Of course this happens.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.196
You know, I mean, how are we gonna stop it?
I don't know.

19:26.225 --> 19:27.757
It's coming from
all over the world.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.493
So, what happens when
you gut the fish on the boat?

19:30.528 --> 19:33.830
You find like a plastic bag, or like,
bottle caps, things like that.

19:33.866 --> 19:37.166
Wow. You are what you eat depending
on what the fish ingests,

19:37.201 --> 19:40.803
so it's probably not the best
for the fish, and for you.

19:40.839 --> 19:45.174
Yeung: <i>Plastic in our world's
oceans is reaching crisis levels.</i>

19:45.209 --> 19:49.078
<i>Since the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch was discovered in 1997,</i>

19:49.113 --> 19:52.481
<i>four additional patches have
been found across the globe,</i>

19:52.516 --> 19:54.850
<i>accumulating more
and more plastic.</i>

19:54.886 --> 19:57.953
<i>We spoke with Dominic Waughray
at the World Economic Forum,</i>

19:57.989 --> 20:00.822
<i>who is tracking the problem
on a global scale.</i>

20:00.858 --> 20:05.727
Plastic is one of the most pervasive
human-made materials that we have.

20:05.763 --> 20:07.629
We have the problem
that we make a lot of plastic.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.666
We kind of use it once, or at the most
twice, and then we get rid of it,

20:11.702 --> 20:14.335
<i>and ultimately, it can
only go into three places.</i>

20:14.371 --> 20:15.604
<i>It can be burnt,</i>

20:15.639 --> 20:17.171
<i>it can be landfilled,</i>

20:17.207 --> 20:21.410
<i>or it can be dumped, and dumping
often then means the sea.</i>

20:21.445 --> 20:23.812
Don't forget with the mass
urbanization that we're going through

20:23.847 --> 20:25.213
a lot of this is
in coastal areas.

20:25.248 --> 20:28.182
<i>Most big cities are by the sea.</i>

20:28.218 --> 20:31.786
<i>Eight million tons of that plastic
goes into the ocean every year.</i>

20:31.821 --> 20:33.121
That's about an equivalent

20:33.156 --> 20:35.156
of one garbage truck
every minute.

20:35.191 --> 20:40.461
<i>That one garbage truck will become
four garbage trucks by 2050 or so.</i>

20:40.496 --> 20:43.230
<i>If we carry on that rate,
there will be more plastic,</i>

20:43.265 --> 20:45.999
by weight,
in the ocean than fish.

20:46.035 --> 20:50.771
So as a human, sort of, conundrum,
this, surely, can't be good.

20:50.807 --> 20:52.005
What is the wake-up call?

20:52.041 --> 20:56.444
Yeung: <i>With 165 million tons of
plastic already in the ocean,</i>

20:56.479 --> 20:57.945
<i>and more being
dumped in every day,</i>

20:57.980 --> 21:01.949
<i>it's hard to imagine how we would
even begin to clean this up.</i>

21:01.984 --> 21:05.986
<i>But there is someone who is
attempting to do just that.</i>

21:06.021 --> 21:08.455
When talking about
environmental issues,

21:08.490 --> 21:10.157
I think a common response is,

21:10.192 --> 21:11.992
"Well, that's, pfft,
a long way off.

21:12.027 --> 21:14.160
That's for our children
to worry about."

21:14.195 --> 21:16.195
So, hello, here I am.

21:16.230 --> 21:20.533
Yeung: <i>Since Boyan was 16, he's
been on an environmental mission.</i>

21:20.569 --> 21:22.034
<i>Now, six years later,</i>

21:22.070 --> 21:25.104
<i>he's crowd-funded millions of
dollars to start his own company:</i>

21:25.139 --> 21:26.840
<i>The Ocean Cleanup.</i>

21:26.875 --> 21:29.576
<i>Along with a team of top
engineers and scientists,</i>

21:29.611 --> 21:31.277
<i>their goal is simple:</i>

21:31.312 --> 21:33.645
<i>To rid the world's
oceans of plastic.</i>

21:33.681 --> 21:36.415
<i>We caught up with Boyan
at the Ocean Cleanup offices</i>

21:36.451 --> 21:37.616
<i>and plastic laboratory.</i>

21:37.651 --> 21:39.885
So, this is the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.587
This is the concentration
of plastic,

21:41.622 --> 21:43.155
- these little specks here?
- Right.

21:43.191 --> 21:45.157
- So, there are... there are five
of them in the world. Mm-hmm.

21:45.193 --> 21:47.793
And because the North Pacific is most
polluted, we'll start with that.

21:47.828 --> 21:50.395
We're trying all these
different variables,

21:50.430 --> 21:52.965
like how large should it be,
what angle should it be,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.835
to get to a system that collects most
plastic for as little cost as possible.

21:56.871 --> 21:59.004
Yeung:
<i>Boyan and his team spent years</i>

21:59.039 --> 22:01.373
<i>mapping the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch to understand</i>

22:01.408 --> 22:02.908
<i>how to go about cleaning it up.</i>

22:02.943 --> 22:05.943
So talk me through how
the Ocean Cleanup works.

22:05.979 --> 22:08.513
So really the problem is that
although there is a lot of plastic,

22:08.548 --> 22:10.515
it's spread out over
a very large area,

22:10.550 --> 22:13.584
so you first need to concentrate
it before you get it out.

22:13.620 --> 22:15.520
So, what we propose is to deploy

22:15.555 --> 22:18.490
sort of an artificial coastline,
where there is no coastline,

22:18.525 --> 22:21.692
<i>So we have this very long
array of floating barriers</i>

22:21.728 --> 22:23.728
<i>that is anchored to the sea bed.</i>

22:23.763 --> 22:25.730
<i>The ocean current does
the hard work for us,</i>

22:25.765 --> 22:27.331
brings the plastic towards it,

22:27.366 --> 22:28.900
and concentrates in the center.

22:28.935 --> 22:32.403
And once it's in the center, it's so
dense you can hardly see the water,

22:32.438 --> 22:34.906
and that's the spot where
we can then easily take it out,

22:34.941 --> 22:37.707
and store it before shipping
it to land for recycling.

22:37.743 --> 22:41.578
<i>Over 95 percent of the mass
is still in those big objects,</i>

22:41.613 --> 22:43.113
<i>which is so urgent to clean up,</i>

22:43.149 --> 22:46.050
because all that big stuff
will become micro-plastics

22:46.085 --> 22:48.152
<i>over the next few decades,
which is the problem.</i>

22:48.187 --> 22:52.389
Why has no one else attempted to clean
up on the scale that you're proposing?

22:52.425 --> 22:57.894
People assume that a complex problem
requires a complex solution,

22:57.930 --> 23:01.264
but I think the simpler a
solution can be, the better.

23:01.299 --> 23:03.700
When I started this, I didn't
know whether it would work,

23:03.735 --> 23:07.270
but I thought, considering
the scale of the problem,

23:07.305 --> 23:09.605
that it was just
important to at least try.

23:10.675 --> 23:12.841
Yeung: <i>After months spent
perfecting the design,</i>

23:12.877 --> 23:15.545
<i>Boyan's invention is ready
for the ultimate test.</i>

23:16.681 --> 23:19.682
<i>To find out whether
it can survive in the ocean.</i>

23:21.953 --> 23:25.621
Welcome to the Ocean Cleanup's
prototype unveiling.

23:32.663 --> 23:36.699
Boyan and his team have got their first
prototype in the sea going out today.

23:36.734 --> 23:39.134
So, we're gonna go and see the
progress in getting it out.

23:39.169 --> 23:41.136
And there's going to be tests
for all weather sorts,

23:41.171 --> 23:43.271
which is the perfect place
to do it here on the North Sea.

23:43.307 --> 23:44.806
It gets pretty stormy out here.

23:52.282 --> 23:54.682
The conditions in the
North Sea are pretty severe.

23:54.718 --> 23:57.352
Now, with the first minor
storm, we'll get forces higher

23:57.387 --> 23:59.754
than during a hundred-year
storm in the Pacific Ocean.

23:59.789 --> 24:04.458
It's pretty safe to say that if it
survives here, it will survive anywhere.

24:04.494 --> 24:08.362
Yeung: <i> But to scale the array to be
scooping up the Pacific Garbage Patch,</i>

24:08.397 --> 24:09.931
<i>Boyan has a way to go.</i>

24:09.966 --> 24:11.465
What we're seeing here
is just one segment,

24:11.501 --> 24:14.902
and eventually, the thing will be about
a thousand times larger than this.

24:14.938 --> 24:16.970
- Wow.
- And then somewhere in the center

24:17.006 --> 24:19.006
of the giant
V-shaped array,

24:19.041 --> 24:22.443
we would have these conveyor belts
and pumps to extract the plastic.

24:22.478 --> 24:26.079
I mean, 100 kilometers, it's very
large for a manmade structure,

24:26.115 --> 24:28.849
but it's peanuts compared to
the size of the Pacific Ocean.

24:35.858 --> 24:37.524
Yeung: <i>Assuming everything
does go to plan,</i>

24:37.559 --> 24:38.725
what's the next step?

24:38.761 --> 24:42.328
We should be ready to deploy the
first full operational system

24:42.364 --> 24:44.064
uh, by late 2017.

24:44.099 --> 24:46.499
So that will be the first time
we're actually removing plastic

24:46.535 --> 24:47.701
from the ocean at a large scale.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.001
And then, if that goes well,

24:49.037 --> 24:52.738
we should be ready to start the
largest cleanup in history by 2020.

24:52.774 --> 24:56.075
So, this is just the beginning,
it's not the end.

24:56.110 --> 24:58.278
Yeung: <i>While Boyan
works towards hitting</i>

24:58.313 --> 25:00.079
<i>the next milestone
of his experiment,</i>

25:00.114 --> 25:02.048
<i>he's simultaneously
planning what to do</i>

25:02.083 --> 25:04.450
<i>with the degraded plastic
he's able to collect</i>

25:04.486 --> 25:05.617
<i>and how to make
it valuable again.</i>

25:05.653 --> 25:08.420
Boyan: <i>This is one of the
companies we're working with</i>

25:08.455 --> 25:11.256
to actually produce the recycling
product, because eventually,

25:11.292 --> 25:16.062
this is sort of how we want to
finance the whole Ocean Cleanup.

25:16.097 --> 25:19.031
This is a machine, where we
put in the flakes... Mm-hmm.

25:19.067 --> 25:21.633
So the ground-up
ocean plastic objects.

25:21.669 --> 25:25.036
So to get the... the highest
quality of, uh, of plastic

25:25.072 --> 25:27.906
we really want to sort it
first before recycling it.

25:32.713 --> 25:37.216
Then it should exit here as... Ooh!
It's coming out like spaghetti.

25:37.251 --> 25:38.883
It's like a pasta machine.

25:38.919 --> 25:40.518
It is exactly as
a pasta machine.

25:42.155 --> 25:44.756
Yeung: <i>The process involves
chopping up the plastic</i>

25:44.791 --> 25:47.225
<i>into tiny beads,
known as nurdles.</i>

25:47.260 --> 25:52.296
<i>These are then sold and melted down into
the objects we use in everyday life.</i>

25:52.332 --> 25:54.498
So then it's just
shredding it up in nuggets?

25:54.534 --> 25:58.436
Boyan: Yeah, so this is sort of the
whole currency of the plastic industry.

25:58.471 --> 26:01.939
So, car companies buy these
nurdles to make their products,

26:01.974 --> 26:04.442
and furniture companies
use them as well.

26:04.477 --> 26:07.612
So, it's sort of giving
ocean plastic a second life.

26:07.647 --> 26:09.580
This is pretty cool to know that

26:09.616 --> 26:12.282
this plastic has been around
for the last few decades,

26:12.317 --> 26:14.017
and could have come
from anywhere in the world.

26:14.053 --> 26:15.953
Oh, yeah, and this
could have well been

26:15.988 --> 26:20.523
some of the first plastic that was ever
produced at scale in the '50s and the '60s.

26:22.561 --> 26:25.729
Yeung: <i> While Boyan is recycling ocean
plastics into more permanent uses,</i>

26:25.765 --> 26:29.566
<i>the vast majority of the world's
plastics are never recycled at all.</i>

26:29.601 --> 26:34.937
<i>In fact, even the most commonly used
are only recycled 14% of the time.</i>

26:34.973 --> 26:37.307
<i>But at IBM,
Dr. Jeannette Garcia</i>

26:37.342 --> 26:40.310
<i>is developing a process
called "chemical recycling"</i>

26:40.345 --> 26:43.780
<i>that could change how we think
about plastics altogether.</i>

26:43.815 --> 26:46.949
How do you see plastic? Is it a
big problem or a great invention?

26:46.985 --> 26:49.218
I think of plastic as being
a great invention,

26:49.254 --> 26:51.654
because it permeates
our entire life.

26:51.689 --> 26:55.057
Garcia: <i>Plastic is ubiquitous,
in everything from shoes,</i>

26:55.093 --> 26:58.694
<i>pills, to healthcare,
to disposable syringes,</i>

26:58.729 --> 27:01.863
<i>and so to try to do
away with it completely,</i>

27:01.899 --> 27:04.700
<i>is probably not a viable option.</i>

27:04.735 --> 27:07.569
Tell us about chemical recycling and
why you think that's the answer.

27:07.605 --> 27:10.105
The main difference is that
in mechanical recycling,

27:10.140 --> 27:13.175
<i>what you're doing is
you're taking the material</i>

27:13.210 --> 27:16.044
<i>and you have to shred it down,
then melt it down, remold it,</i>

27:16.079 --> 27:19.848
<i>and it can only happen a certain number
of times before it loses the properties.</i>

27:19.883 --> 27:22.417
Chemical recycling is different,
because what you actually do

27:22.452 --> 27:25.120
is you take the material,
and you chemically react it

27:25.155 --> 27:28.423
so it goes back down
to its most fundamental unit.

27:28.458 --> 27:31.126
<i>That fundamental unit
can then be reacted again</i>

27:31.161 --> 27:33.594
<i>back into the same thing
or into something different,</i>

27:33.630 --> 27:37.498
and we can reach a 100 percent,
like, full cycle process.

27:37.534 --> 27:39.534
Yeung: <i>If we can scale
this process up,</i>

27:39.569 --> 27:43.037
<i>we could take the hundreds of millions
of tons of discarded plastics</i>

27:43.072 --> 27:47.274
<i>recycle them, and move towards
a zero waste economy.</i>

27:47.310 --> 27:50.110
People are gonna start realizing
that we can save money,

27:50.146 --> 27:52.579
and a lot of money
by recycling materials,

27:52.614 --> 27:55.349
and so that it makes
sense from all standpoints.

27:55.384 --> 27:59.553
We have to start thinking
of our landfills as gold mines.

28:01.190 --> 28:04.124
Yeung: <i>With the right approach,
and the will to make it happen,</i>

28:04.160 --> 28:06.393
<i>all this trash would
become valuable again,</i>

28:06.428 --> 28:09.363
<i>and solving this mammoth
environmental task</i>

28:09.398 --> 28:11.898
<i>could create an
economic miracle.</i>

28:11.933 --> 28:15.068
Waughray: <i>Economically, if we had
to pay for all that plastic,</i>

28:15.103 --> 28:16.803
which we could do
something better with,

28:16.839 --> 28:19.906
<i>between $80 and
$120 billion a year</i>

28:19.941 --> 28:23.709
<i>that you can make valuable with straight
away, effectively we're dumping,</i>

28:23.745 --> 28:26.512
but like anything in life,
if there's a problem,

28:26.547 --> 28:28.147
then there's gonna
be opportunity.

28:28.183 --> 28:30.116
<i>We know through
history in terms of</i>

28:30.151 --> 28:32.418
<i>disruptions in industries
or new products</i>

28:32.453 --> 28:36.856
that it's kind of innovators and disruptors
who kind of take us to the next level.

28:36.892 --> 28:39.492
Boyan: The fact that we
now are creating a path

28:39.527 --> 28:42.461
in which there is a chance that
we can have clean oceans again,

28:42.497 --> 28:44.630
that could potentially inspire

28:44.665 --> 28:46.465
a lot more people to get
involved with this problem.

28:46.501 --> 28:49.535
Boyan: <i>Human history is
a long list of things</i>

28:49.570 --> 28:51.504
<i>that couldn't be done
and then were done.</i>

28:51.539 --> 28:53.305
<i>Really, the challenge
in this century</i>

28:53.340 --> 28:55.974
is to convert a lifestyle
created in a previous century

28:56.010 --> 28:59.010
into one that will still
be around in the next century.
