00:06.374 --> 00:06.540
.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.675
- I just wanna find my sister,
take her home

00:09.377 --> 00:10.378
Where is she?
- She's at the house.

00:10.411 --> 00:11.512
- What is this place?

00:11.545 --> 00:12.580
- The Summer House.

00:12.613 --> 00:13.814
Our little plantation

00:13.847 --> 00:15.383
on top of the food chain.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.185
- If you don't eat
enough protein,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.187
the body just starts
to eat itself.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.156
- [grunting]

00:22.190 --> 00:25.293
- What's in there?
- Bootleggers built the house.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.828
There's all tunnels,
but they're boarded up.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.730
- What was that?

00:29.763 --> 00:31.232
- It's your disease.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.501
The evolution of your madness.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.569
It'll heal itself
and grow back.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.839
It needs to be extracted.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.175
- If it comes down
to his own son

00:41.209 --> 00:42.576
and a family of monsters,

00:42.610 --> 00:45.246
he's got my back.
- Damn idiot.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.181
How could you be so stupid?

00:47.215 --> 00:48.249
- Whose side are you on?

00:48.282 --> 00:51.219
[blade slices]

00:51.252 --> 00:53.721
[gurgling]
- Ohh.

00:53.754 --> 00:58.092
- Let's toast to the family.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.094
- To family.

*

01:55.816 --> 01:58.519
[knocking at door]

01:58.552 --> 02:01.655
- It's time to face
the music, Chief.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.331
[indistinct whispers]

02:12.966 --> 02:16.804
- I used to go sing
in a choir in this church

02:16.837 --> 02:17.905
when I was very young.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.508
Nice to meet you, Zoey.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.544
Then my voice changed.
They kicked me out of class.

02:23.577 --> 02:30.751
*

02:30.784 --> 02:33.187
Let's take a walk.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.624
Open...

02:36.657 --> 02:38.692
wide.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.533
[inhales sharply, gags]

[clunking]

04:31.972 --> 04:34.342
[tapping]

04:39.713 --> 04:41.949
- Joseph.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.085
You're wasting time.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.887
If we don't deliver
the little girl

04:46.920 --> 04:49.390
by midnight tomorrow,

04:49.423 --> 04:51.559
he won't be merciful.
- Shh.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.827
I hear a heartbeat.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.363
- Joseph,

04:55.396 --> 04:56.830
that is not the child

04:56.864 --> 04:58.632
you should be worried about.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.369
- Will you stop nagging me?
I'll find her.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.637
- And if you can't?

05:03.671 --> 05:06.073
We promised the little girl.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.442
We marked the little girl.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.345
We must deliver
the little girl.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.914
- It kicked me.
- [laughs]

05:13.947 --> 05:16.116
- Oh! You think
you're untouchable.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.886
But we're running out of time.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.490
He'll be the end of us.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.396
[muffled thumping]

[roaring]

06:47.475 --> 06:50.678
[intense screeching]

06:57.851 --> 07:02.022
- You and your father,
you believe in family.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.524
- Where is he, Chief?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.560
- I believe in family, too.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.996
Family and justice.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.499
- Where is my brother?

07:13.501 --> 07:17.070
- My son...

07:17.104 --> 07:19.640
he'd made a horrible mistake.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.144
He killed your brother.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.680
But he paid the price.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.248
I did what I had to do,

07:28.281 --> 07:32.219
family for family.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.254
So...

07:34.287 --> 07:37.725
we could tie it off here.

07:37.758 --> 07:42.563
Stop any further bloodshed.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.165
There are two bodies
in that hole.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.268
Go, look.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.271
[tense tone]

07:51.304 --> 07:58.679
*

08:04.217 --> 08:06.787
- Did you forget how to count?

08:06.820 --> 08:09.056
- What?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.892
- [chattering]

08:11.925 --> 08:13.126
- No, I--

08:13.160 --> 08:14.294
You--you gotta believe me.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.666
I--I took care of it.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.170
- Children smell his blood.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.638
They'll find him.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.841
[children snarling]

*

08:44.658 --> 08:47.628
[eerie tone]

08:47.661 --> 08:54.802
*

08:54.835 --> 08:56.804
- You know, my brother

08:56.837 --> 08:58.639
was only a couple of years
older than you

08:58.672 --> 09:00.874
when he disappeared.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.676
Oh, yeah.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.979
I built my life around him.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.648
Oh, he did his part,
you know?

09:07.681 --> 09:09.216
I mean, every once in a while

09:09.249 --> 09:10.851
he got himself cleaned up

09:10.884 --> 09:13.987
got a good job,
went out and did it, you know?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.991
Jesus.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.061
His two feet would never
walk in the same direction.

09:21.094 --> 09:24.732
He would backslide
every time.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.369
Decade of that, man.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.204
So during the last time,

09:31.238 --> 09:32.372
when was living with me,

09:32.405 --> 09:34.007
oh, my God,
we had a fight.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.877
It was one of those
big fights, you know?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.378
Where you, like,
say all the things

09:38.411 --> 09:42.115
that you should never
say to anybody that you love.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.084
And...

09:44.117 --> 09:45.619
he spat at me.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.987
My own brother.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.723
I got all up in his face
and I shook my finger

09:49.757 --> 09:52.860
And I said, "Man, you need
to correct your mind."

09:52.893 --> 09:54.127
And...

09:54.161 --> 09:55.896
he bit me.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.397
He bit...

09:57.430 --> 09:59.099
top of my finger clean off

09:59.132 --> 10:02.102
and he swallowed it.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.211
After--

10:11.244 --> 10:16.016
after he disappeared,
I realized...

10:16.049 --> 10:18.151
I was relieved.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.191
A person can only
give so much.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.194
And then they got
nothing left to go around.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.430
- [inhales]

10:30.463 --> 10:32.399
- Hey!

10:32.432 --> 10:34.902
You in there?

10:34.935 --> 10:36.303
You know where you are?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.806
You know who I am?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.407
You're gonna be a little
bit groggy.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.909
Stay still.

10:41.942 --> 10:47.047
Luckily, our girls
have a nasty habit, so...

10:47.080 --> 10:49.950
you're feeling a little
less pain.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.954
- [clearing throat]

10:55.322 --> 10:57.791
[thumping, rattling]

11:01.094 --> 11:02.830
- Where were you?
- There is something else

11:02.863 --> 11:04.331
in this house.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.333
- What?

11:06.366 --> 11:09.703
- I saw something.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.872
Not one of them.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.473
And something worse.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.945
I mean, I--I think
maybe it's, uh...

11:17.978 --> 11:20.247
what they pray to.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.085
- What are you talking about?

11:25.118 --> 11:27.855
- There was a door.
Not like any other doors.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.958
It was a red door.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.061
And I could feel the air
around it just trembling,

11:34.094 --> 11:37.397
like--like--like a boiler room.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.299
I thought it might
be a way downstairs.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.134
Then when I got close,

11:41.168 --> 11:43.503
it, like, repelled me.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.972
Come on, we have to
get out of here.

11:45.005 --> 11:45.973
We have to find
a way out of here, let's go.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.909
Come on.
- No.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.278
That's easy for you to say.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.948
- He hasn't told you
what you'll become.

11:56.283 --> 11:59.152
Afterwards, I mean.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.832
[dark tone]

*

12:20.808 --> 12:23.010
[exhales]

12:28.448 --> 12:31.518
You will be...

12:31.551 --> 12:34.888
very...

12:34.922 --> 12:38.358
very...

12:38.391 --> 12:40.894
hungry.

12:43.897 --> 12:49.402
- Anything is better
than going insane.

12:49.436 --> 12:54.207
I feel like I am
catching on fire

12:54.241 --> 12:57.277
in slow motion.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.545
Zo...

12:58.578 --> 13:01.148
our entire lives,

13:01.181 --> 13:05.485
we have been on the edge
of something terrible.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.889
Don't you just--
for once in your life--

13:08.922 --> 13:11.158
just wanna be taken care of?

13:12.225 --> 13:15.829
Protected?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.298
- That is like saying
you are so scared

13:18.331 --> 13:21.334
of being disfigured...

13:21.368 --> 13:24.838
that you have decided to let
someone cut your face off.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.947
- I think I am here
for a reason.

13:33.981 --> 13:36.349
I think things happen
for a reason.

13:38.351 --> 13:42.489
- I am going to go
find us a door...

13:42.522 --> 13:45.192
that leads downstairs.

- Huh!

- Who the hell are you?

16:02.029 --> 16:04.597
- I'm a gardener.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.001
Is that who I am or what I do?

16:09.269 --> 16:12.372
- So you like questions?

16:12.405 --> 16:15.008
- I like riddles.

16:15.042 --> 16:18.111
- Do you know what's
behind that red door,

16:18.145 --> 16:21.781
and why it will not
let me through it?

16:21.814 --> 16:25.118
- That's not a riddle.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.320
- Okay, um--

16:29.322 --> 16:32.659
How--how about this? Um--

16:32.692 --> 16:34.594
I'm--I'm not a Peach,

16:34.627 --> 16:38.498
a--a fly,

16:38.531 --> 16:42.402
yet I get past
the red door.

16:42.435 --> 16:46.039
What am I?

16:46.839 --> 16:49.242

- You have to hide
just a little bit longer.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.616
- Okay.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.323
- And up.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.491
Now, I'm doing the lifting.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.426
- [grunting]
- Go Luke!

18:13.460 --> 18:16.229
Ah, not too much.
Not too much.

18:16.263 --> 18:20.467
Okay, okay.
[sighs]

18:21.468 --> 18:24.504
- [mouthing]

18:26.806 --> 18:29.542
- He--he did this to you.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.646
He missed your artery,
or you'd be dead.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.683
Nicked you real good.
- Ah-- [winces]

18:36.716 --> 18:41.254
- No, don't try.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.590
And, hey, look.

Oh.

Sit. Stay.
Don't move, don't move.

Okay.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.915
Now we're gonna practice
standing up.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.818
Ready? Down.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.887
Go down.
- [moans]

19:14.921 --> 19:19.326
Down. Down.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.528
Down. There we go.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.430
Stay with me.
All right.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.465
Stay with me. There you go.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.434
All right.
I'm gonna put you down.

19:27.467 --> 19:31.638
- [moans]
Okay, easy.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.941
There's a way out.
The bootleg tunnel.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.777
Okay, just hang on for me.

[door creaks]

20:08.975 --> 20:11.911
Hi, Alice.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.347
Come join us.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.650
What's on your mind?

20:19.819 --> 20:22.822
- It's about Izzy.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.857
- She came back?

20:24.891 --> 20:28.027
I had that feeling
she'd have come to you.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.797
Will you take me to her?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.636
- What will you do--

20:36.669 --> 20:41.040
- Alice, we don't eat children.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.611
We'll and then
we'll fix you.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.714
Where is she?

20:49.416 --> 20:53.019
[tense, eerie music]

20:53.052 --> 20:56.022
- I'll show you.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.691
- Good girl.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.796
- Come on, sugar plum.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.299
I can't wait for you to see
where I live.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.067
I got a couple of kids
your age.

21:08.100 --> 21:11.304
I think you're all
gonna get along so swell.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.872
You wanna feel my belly?

21:12.905 --> 21:14.974
Go on.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.076
[gasps]

21:17.109 --> 21:19.379

nothing to be scared of.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.565
Okay?

21:38.598 --> 21:42.068
Hey, let's go home.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.536
Yeah.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.904
Right through that
pretty, red door.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.975
- Luke?

22:57.810 --> 22:59.979
- Are you here to finish
what you started?

23:03.215 --> 23:06.052
- He came to you...

23:06.085 --> 23:07.787
for help.
- I found him

23:07.820 --> 23:10.857
where you left him for dead.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.095
- You brought back the head.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.565
- Evidence.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.773
- I came to set right
what I did.

23:26.806 --> 23:30.610
I'll take it from here.
- Like hell you will.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.783
- I--I wanted to make it quick.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.951
I was afraid of
what they'd do to you.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.488
- Father of the year.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.224
- This ain't the mob, son.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.994
You can't just go to the--
the Feds for help.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.599
I panicked.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.473
- [exhales]

24:11.984 --> 24:13.653
- Now?

24:13.686 --> 24:16.856
Now we're both marked.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.257
Now we get the hell
out of here

24:18.290 --> 24:20.793
and figure out our next move.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.533
I took care of them.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.902
- He means they're not dead.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.071
They'll get back up.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.576
He means we have to
cut off their heads.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.648
Are you with us or them?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.722
- Let's get started.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.669
[door opens]

25:04.236 --> 25:06.639
- They're looking for a kid.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.641
They need her for something.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.943
- Yeah, but it's not
what you think. [chuckles]

25:10.977 --> 25:13.179
Izzy was lost up here,
but I found her.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.781
And they let her go.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.550
- A--are you sure about that?

25:17.584 --> 25:21.253
- Zoey...

25:21.287 --> 25:22.922
it's like...

25:22.955 --> 25:26.659
I'm in this burning building,

25:26.693 --> 25:29.862
and I could either
be burned alive or jump.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.598
And I don't know what's gonna
happen when I jump,

25:31.631 --> 25:34.567
but I know that there's
someone down there to catch me.

the people who live here?

you had?

You were six.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.517
Carly or Christie

the mailman comes
knocking on the door.

"The Starving Kids."

36:58.049 --> 37:01.920
kid, you can't save everyone.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.022
Know what I'm saying?

37:04.055 --> 37:08.627
I'm saying that
compartmentalization

37:08.660 --> 37:12.631
is a psychological
survival skill.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.902
You gotta take care
of those you know.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.870
Those you love.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.372
Those you don't,

37:20.406 --> 37:24.009
they're less of a priority.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.745
You get me?

- Ahh!

tonight, Mama?

37:47.833 --> 37:51.803

a big casserole.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.472
You poor thing.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.675
You must be exhausted
after today.
