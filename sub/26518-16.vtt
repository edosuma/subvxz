00:06.632 --> 00:08.067
<i>It's in the air as we speak.</i>

00:08.090 --> 00:10.378
Your task is to bring it down
before its scheduled landing

00:10.552 --> 00:11.838
in DC in three hours.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.826
Restore access to
the Bradley analytic servers!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.136
Restoring access now!

00:21.438 --> 00:23.020

We're back.</i>

<i>Tasha, where are you?</i>

00:36.411 --> 00:38.181
<i>I'm on my way to Zurich...
I know where Madeline</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:39.912
<i>keeps the documents
she won't destroy.</i>

00:44.962 --> 00:45.962
Uhh!

00:54.429 --> 00:57.172
This card has been inserted
into an unauthorized device.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.183
Your friend was just putting it
into her phone when I got there.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.560
- It was in her phone?
- For like one second.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.541
I'm pretty sure she didn't
get anything off it.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.477
Okay. Pay the woman.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.354
From the Remington fund.

01:09.653 --> 01:10.689
Are you sure?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.987
Yeah. Pretty sure.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.443
Wait, Dominic,
what are you...

01:18.328 --> 01:19.489
We could have
used her help.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.700
You're right.
We do need help.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.032
And I know
just how to find it.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.918
Drone has been authorized.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.156
<i>You thought you could use
a drone to solve your problems,</i>

01:37.180 --> 01:38.900
<i>but you just made a bigger one
for yourself.</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:41.716
Once I found out
your dirty little secret,

01:41.893 --> 01:44.135
I knew he was
the perfect patsy.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.688
<i>You exceeded our wildest
expectations.</i>

01:46.857 --> 01:48.314
"Our" expectations?

01:48.942 --> 01:49.942
What do you want?

01:50.027 --> 01:51.268
<i>In the near future,</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:52.772
I'm gonna
call for a favor,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.313
and you're gonna do
everything I say.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.843
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

02:00.829 --> 02:02.949
If I had this app,
what did I need you for?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.330
My winning smile.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.330
We stopped Zapata from
getting the Helios file.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.621
Now we have the director
of the FBI in our back pocket.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.330
And to think, two days ago,
I thought we were in trouble.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.250
Don't call it a comeback.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.882
People who could still
be a liability.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.925
I don't see
Zapata's name on here.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.557
I have something special
planned for her.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.893
You lose a contact?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.210
Madeline left in a rush...
she could have

02:31.234 --> 02:33.114
left something here
that could help us find her.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.672
Forensics scoured
every inch of this place.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.812
There's nothing here.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.389
Forensics don't know
Madeline Burke.

02:37.908 --> 02:38.908
What...

02:39.117 --> 02:40.157
<i>Whoa, oh...
okay, I get it.</i>

02:40.285 --> 02:42.125
This place wasn't exactly
a safe haven for you.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.447
You don't know
the half of it.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.850
I know the half that got me
tied up and beat down

02:45.874 --> 02:46.874
in my own apartment.

02:47.042 --> 02:47.875
Uhh!

02:47.876 --> 02:50.584
Her cruelty, her mind games.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.165
If Madeline gets away...

02:52.297 --> 02:53.608
Then you'll think you will
have done this for nothing.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.668
But that's not the case.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.336
<i>Thanks to you,
she's on the run.</i>

02:56.551 --> 02:58.543
We're taking apart
HCI Global piece by piece.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.716
She's got no one to turn to,
nowhere to go.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.009
Her back's against the wall.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.389
That's what
I'm afraid of.

03:03.558 --> 03:04.969
Uhh!

03:13.819 --> 03:17.984
Patterson's log,
entry 44074.

03:18.198 --> 03:22.693
The Mystery of
the Hooded Figure continues.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.077
It's been three days
since they entered

03:25.247 --> 03:26.954
Shepherd's secret bunker.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.910
<i>We have no idea
who they are.</i>

03:29.084 --> 03:30.564
You're never
gonna believe this.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.243
Wait a second, what
were you just doing?

03:32.838 --> 03:35.046
It's nothing.
What's... what am I not gonna believe?

03:35.173 --> 03:38.883
The mystery person's jacket
is a Housley's Ribs exclusive,

03:39.010 --> 03:40.876
<i>sold only
in their restaurants.</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:43.637
Okay, great,
if we can just access their sales database...

03:43.807 --> 03:47.300
Their 578 restaurants
across 48 states.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.685
Also,
that line was discontinued seven years ago,

03:49.896 --> 03:51.853
but their records only go back six.
Plus...

03:52.065 --> 03:53.931
Okay, okay, I get it.
It's a nonstarter.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.852
Okay, so, uh,
speaking of that bunker full of Remi mementos

03:57.028 --> 03:58.735
that send Jane into
an emotional tailspin,

03:58.905 --> 04:00.021
how's she doin'?

04:06.121 --> 04:07.328
Good morning.

04:07.998 --> 04:08.998
Hey.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.999
You sure that you don't want me
to stay at home with you today?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.160
No. No, go in.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.579
Maybe tomorrow I'll be ready.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.249
That's exactly what
you said to me yesterday.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.962
I know,
it's just that every time

04:21.136 --> 04:24.550
I think about leaving...
or going outside,

04:24.848 --> 04:27.511
my body freezes up,
and it's like it's...

04:27.934 --> 04:31.473
warning me that the whole world
is just one, big time bomb,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.554
waiting to explode in my face.

04:33.774 --> 04:37.563
You can't hide from
these Remi memories forever.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.944
Well, I wish
it was just memories.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.564
<i>I think about
her lying to you,</i>

04:42.741 --> 04:43.982
and how close she was to...

04:44.618 --> 04:46.325
What are you hiding
behind your back?

04:47.621 --> 04:48.621
It's poison.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.541
I've done
some calling around.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.286
<i>I've been searching
for a therapist</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:58.455
that is the best
at helping someone

04:58.590 --> 05:00.350
that's going through
the things that you are.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.505
And one name
just kept coming up.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.637
All right, now...
it's totally up to you.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.426
I'm just letting you know.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.059
Thank you.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.396
Got it.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.474
Well, at least
now you know you never

05:31.498 --> 05:32.989
have to come
back here again, right?

05:35.752 --> 05:36.952
What's the deal
with this tree?

05:37.420 --> 05:38.420
It's creepy.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.421
It's called
the Tree of Death.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.715
Of course.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.487
<i>Hey, if we leave now,
we can still make it</i>

05:44.511 --> 05:45.922
to Mabel's
for some fresh scones.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.346
Get down!

06:09.744 --> 06:11.944
What the hell was that?
They trying to take out Madeline?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.120
Madeline's on the run,
and the whole world knows it.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.330
Those are for us.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.424
I thought
everything was fine

06:33.602 --> 06:36.436
until I...
ran into Gibbs.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.347
Cameron Gibbs.
I recruited you.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.856
The harmless pencil-pusher

06:41.026 --> 06:43.769
that Remi turned into
a killing machine.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.147
And every time I think
about him, I feel...

06:49.492 --> 06:51.449
I'm sorry, it's hard
to put into words.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.906
It's not the memories
themselves

06:53.079 --> 06:54.365
that are paralyzing you.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.030
<i>It's the internal conflict</i>

06:56.207 --> 06:58.244
<i>between Remi's
emotions and your own...</i>

06:58.543 --> 07:01.456
between her rage
and your remorse.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.624
Yeah, that's exactly right.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.500
Uh, so... what should I do?

07:06.676 --> 07:09.384
Honestly, this would be
uncharted territory for me.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.214
Hmm.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.628
<i>The good news...</i>

07:12.057 --> 07:13.923
This is a cognitive
behavioral therapist

07:14.100 --> 07:15.261
out of Columbia.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.727
An expert in, well,
unusual diagnoses.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.476
If I give her
your case history...

07:23.777 --> 07:25.564
I believe she'll be
willing to see you today.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.112
So you're saying
you can't help me.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.676
I just don't want
to promise you something

07:30.700 --> 07:32.066
I'm not sure I can deliver.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.655
Oh, man, it's like
the last scene in <i>Scarface.</i>

07:37.832 --> 07:39.539
Is this Madeline's handiwork?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.996
A high-caliber machine gun
in broad daylight?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.207
Doesn't fit her M.O...
too sloppy, too impersonal,

07:44.381 --> 07:46.101
and she's on the run,
keeping a low profile.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.465
Ballistics tracked
the path of the bullets

07:48.802 --> 07:50.259
back to their source.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.296
<i>The tenth floor of the building
across the street.</i>

07:53.515 --> 07:56.223
And the cameras there caught
a glimpse of this man.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.676
He was the only person to
enter and exit the building

07:58.853 --> 08:00.435
in the timeframe
of the shooting

08:00.730 --> 08:02.642
<i>while also carrying a case
that was large enough</i>

08:02.816 --> 08:04.478
<i>to conceal
a high-caliber weapon.</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:07.860
<i>Officially, he is Alonzo Cruz,
international businessman.</i>

08:08.029 --> 08:09.029
And unofficially?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.901
The DEA believes he's
Alonzo Cortez.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.397
<i>Cousin of Franco Cortez,</i>

08:12.450 --> 08:14.191
the leader of
the Sabinito drug cartel.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.530
We want to borrow
your hacker.

08:15.704 --> 08:16.740
It's a deal.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.787
He's the cartel's
chief hit man,

08:18.957 --> 08:20.448
their one-man death squad.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.040
So the cartel's
gunning for you.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.396
I did kill their man,
Del Toro.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.581
This could be about revenge.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.416
You're not the only
friend of the FBI

08:26.589 --> 08:27.775
that was involved
in the murder, though.

08:27.799 --> 08:28.960
Boston was there, too.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.362
Maybe we should bring him in,
you know, like for protection?

08:31.386 --> 08:32.822
For protection, or so
you can get reacquainted

08:32.846 --> 08:33.927
with your newly-freed ex?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.054
Excuse me, would you
ask Kurt that about Jane?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.840
- How dare you?
- That's not even...

08:38.018 --> 08:39.679
Okay! Rich isn't wrong.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.553
About Boston.
He could be in trouble.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.722
<i>All right, fine.</i>

08:44.899 --> 08:46.059
We'll bring in
the little guy.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.646
It's the right thing to do.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.777
And the only person that knew
that ZIP had fatal side effects

08:53.950 --> 08:55.441
was my brother, who was...

08:55.618 --> 08:57.905
Sorry, sorry.
Uh, your brother, that's...

08:58.371 --> 08:59.657
- Roman.
<i>- Roman.</i>

09:00.040 --> 09:01.247
Yes, the psychopath.
Of course.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.203
And... And Alice was...

09:03.752 --> 09:04.788
She was who I used to be.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.281
Uh, I thought
you used to be Remi.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.666
I did, I-I was Alice

09:09.049 --> 09:10.290
before I was Remi.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.207
Got it, got it.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.627
And these glowing tattoos
that you mentioned,

09:14.804 --> 09:15.804
was that a metaphor?

09:15.889 --> 09:17.881
<i>What did you mean
by that?</i>

09:18.058 --> 09:19.515
I mean, they glow.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.684
Uh...

09:22.145 --> 09:23.636
I don't think
this is the right fit.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.770
And Shepherd, your mother...

09:25.899 --> 09:28.061
I mean, not your mother-mother,
but your, um...

09:28.234 --> 09:29.896
uh, whatever she was.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.195
Is that name
a metaphor as well or...

09:36.076 --> 09:37.317
The cartel
just struck again.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.679
What? Please tell me
it's not Boston.

09:38.703 --> 09:39.739
It's not Boston.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.140
Okay, but is it
actually not Boston,

09:41.164 --> 09:42.808
or are you just saying that
because I said so?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.198
Patterson, please continue.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.667
Former HCI Global exec
John Siracusa

09:46.836 --> 09:49.328
was just found dead
in the trunk of his town car.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.088
An ATM camera found

09:51.257 --> 09:54.375
Mr. International Businessman
a block away,

09:54.552 --> 09:56.259
and the lack of fingernails
on our victim

09:56.429 --> 09:58.887
- suggests torture, cartel style.
- Ugh.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.382
Why was Siracusa targeted
for torture, but not me?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.162
Siracusa might
know how to find Madeline.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.143
I mean, she has to be
a cartel target, too.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.555
And, uh, Boston?
I feel like I heard his name mentioned.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.052
We're still looking
for him, Rich.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.392
Would you relax?
Boston is a free man.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.838
<i>For all we know, he could
be on a beach somewhere,</i>

10:12.862 --> 10:14.502
drinking away his memories
of house arrest

10:14.656 --> 10:16.376
- with a bunch of new friends.
- Wait, what?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.927
<i>What new friends? Is Chet there?</i>

10:17.951 --> 10:19.658
Because if Chet's there,
I swear to God...

10:19.828 --> 10:21.945
Another HCI Global exec
just turned up dead.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.641
- <i>What?
- She was dropped from her balcony,</i>

10:23.665 --> 10:25.873
<i>fell 50 floors...
onto a bus.</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:27.574
That's another
cartel trademark.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.687
- <i>Was anyone else hurt?</i>
- No.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.106
<i>So this is getting
out of hand.</i>

10:30.130 --> 10:31.774
We have to stop Cortez
before any innocent people

10:31.798 --> 10:33.005
become collateral damage.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.534
<i>When you went
to Madeline's office this morning,</i>

10:35.593 --> 10:37.071
you didn't have any plans
to go there, right?

10:37.095 --> 10:37.835
No, I just went.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.095
So for Cortez to know
that you'd be there,

10:40.265 --> 10:41.465
he'd have to be following you.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.285
Rich, you wanna take
your mind off Boston

10:43.309 --> 10:44.495
and go start searching
the traffic cams.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.519
Yeah, okay.
All right.

10:45.562 --> 10:46.562
You gonna join me?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.933
There are two dead
HCI Global execs

10:53.111 --> 10:54.522
and one shot-up office.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.441
The cartel
isn't playing around.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.668
<i>- We need to relocate.
- Not yet.</i>

10:58.700 --> 10:59.740
What do you mean, not yet?

11:00.076 --> 11:01.988
A hit man is torturing
and killing

11:02.162 --> 11:03.573
anyone who can
lead him to us.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.159
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

11:07.959 --> 11:11.043
Okay, so this sedan
was definitely following

11:11.212 --> 11:14.000
Zapata and Reade
from our offices to Madeline's.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.749
<i>Then heads straight
to the Queens Midtown tunnel.</i>

11:16.926 --> 11:18.362
You know, Boston and I
used to play a game

11:18.386 --> 11:19.780
called "The Queen's
Midtown Tunnel."

11:19.804 --> 11:22.888
The car heads straight
into the Queens Midtown tunnel

11:23.057 --> 11:25.094
and never comes out...
how is that even possible?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.804
We used to wonder
the same thing.

11:26.978 --> 11:27.978
Where did the car go?

11:28.062 --> 11:30.224
<i>Check the traffic cams
at Center and 51st.</i>

11:30.773 --> 11:31.773
Look who I found.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.982
Boston! You're alive!

11:34.652 --> 11:35.652
You smell like the beach.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.218
You haven't been
with Chet, have you?

11:37.447 --> 11:39.404
Excuse me, you're not
excited to be back here?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.357
In FBI custody?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.888
This is not the definition of
"free" that I'm familiar with.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.223
Okay, wait, wait. Go back to the traffic
cam thing you were talking about?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.489
Uh, if you drive on
the shoulder and turn right

11:48.666 --> 11:50.853
just as you exit the tunnel,
the tunnel's cameras can miss you,

11:50.877 --> 11:53.540
but the cameras at the next
intersection will not.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.334
Oh, my God, you're right.
There's the car!

11:56.507 --> 11:57.943
You know, you could
at least pretend to be happy

11:57.967 --> 11:59.048
that we saved your life.

11:59.177 --> 12:00.668
Saved my life?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.962
I was out scoping galleries
for my new exhibition

12:03.139 --> 12:05.347
when two federal crew cuts
pulled me out of there.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.952
Oh, suddenly you don't
like guys in crew cuts?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.683
Okay, okay, okay!
Boston's tip worked.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.889
Look, found the car.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.823
It's parked in front of a hotel
by LaGuardia.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.334
We gotta get down there.
Where's Weller?

12:13.358 --> 12:14.668
He went to check on Jane.
Should I ping him?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.212
- No, Zapata and I can handle it.
- Okay.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.694
Finally got people
to buy up

12:18.821 --> 12:20.232
your, uh,
flightless birds

12:20.406 --> 12:21.647
and horned whales
and whatnot?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.573
The work I did while
on house arrest

12:23.743 --> 12:25.484
happens to be selling
like hotcakes.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.069
That is fantastic

12:27.247 --> 12:29.204
that Motel 8
is redecorating.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.389
You know,
the old me would have

12:31.459 --> 12:33.246
been really hurt
by that, but...

12:33.753 --> 12:36.166
I'm an actual artist now,
and I no longer

12:36.339 --> 12:38.581
need to engage with
the peanut gallery.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.333
"Peanut gallery"?

12:40.510 --> 12:41.876
What... What are you, you...

12:42.053 --> 12:44.090
You're... what... what...

12:44.222 --> 12:46.714
Can you believe that guy?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.890
He's here for two seconds
on your request.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.621
- Yeah.
- And you can't stop insulting him!

12:50.645 --> 12:51.852
What is wrong with you?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.094
Don't you take
that tone with me.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.402
I take it
things didn't go well

13:00.530 --> 13:01.530
with the therapist.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.481
Therapists.

13:03.908 --> 13:04.908
Plural.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.781
<i>And none of 'em even knew
where to begin with me.</i>

13:11.082 --> 13:12.323
You need to take time.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.866
I don't have time.

13:14.377 --> 13:15.743
I'm... paralyzed, Kurt.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.128
I need somebody
who could help me now,

13:18.298 --> 13:20.665
someone who has experience
with a case like mine.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.758
That might be a little tough.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.923
<i>No one's dealt with
a case like yours before.</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:28.384
Oh... actually...

13:30.184 --> 13:31.675
There might be one person.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.279
Thanks for seeing me.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.239
I need your help.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.246
You didn't give me
much of a choice.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.916
Look, I've told the FBI
everything I know.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.081
I'm not asking for the FBI.

13:59.547 --> 14:00.708
I'm asking for me.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.592
You've come to me
for therapy?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.257
I have nowhere else
to go.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.971
Think of this as your chance
to help make things right.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.247
The last time
I tried to help you,

14:15.271 --> 14:16.887
my reward was getting
sent here.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.556
This isn't fun for me,
either.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.099
This is a bad idea.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.198
We never had a real
doctor-patient relationship.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.444
<i>My job wasn't to keep you
mentally healthy.</i>

14:24.614 --> 14:26.150
It was to keep you
in the FBI...

14:26.657 --> 14:27.989
to keep you
in Weller's orbit.

14:28.159 --> 14:31.323
No one knows Remi and me
like you do.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.330
You don't need a cheat sheet,
you don't need a... a recap.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.828
You're not just
my best option,

14:38.002 --> 14:40.745
you are my only option.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.130
No, I can't do this.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.048
I'm ready to go
back to my cell!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.342
No! We're not done yet.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.008
<i>I'm not leaving here
until you talk to me.</i>

14:54.268 --> 14:55.600
And neither are you.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.015
Well, I guess you're not
the only one without an option.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.605
Look, as far
as how you got here,

15:03.945 --> 15:05.356
there's a lot of blame
to go around.

15:05.988 --> 15:08.321
<i>All I'm asking
is to let me tell you</i>

15:08.491 --> 15:09.732
<i>what I'm going through.</i>

15:09.909 --> 15:11.741
And then, if you still
don't wanna help,

15:11.911 --> 15:13.118
so be it.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.410
But right now...
just listen.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.614
<i>Madeline.</i>

15:49.657 --> 15:50.773
What a surprise...

15:50.950 --> 15:52.942
I hope we didn't
catch you at a bad time.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.036
Hello to you, too, Dominic.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.959
Going somewhere?

16:03.087 --> 16:04.623
- Just upstate.
<i>- Hmm.</i>

16:04.797 --> 16:07.005
With HCI Global execs
dropping like flies,

16:07.175 --> 16:08.444
I thought it
might be a good idea

16:08.468 --> 16:10.209
to get out of the city
for a bit.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.253
What are you...
doing here?

16:12.430 --> 16:14.547
Shouldn't you be in like
Venezuela or something?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.724
Or something.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.766
<i>All clear.</i>

16:17.101 --> 16:18.101
He's alone.

16:19.228 --> 16:23.347
So... aren't you gonna
offer me a drink?

16:27.195 --> 16:28.402
Thanks for your help
earlier.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.691
<i>De rien.</i>

16:31.282 --> 16:32.739
Ah! Look at that.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.532
Another one
of my pieces sold.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.738
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

16:35.995 --> 16:37.531
Hey...
so we got Alonzo?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.433
Reade and Zapata
brought him in without incident,

16:39.457 --> 16:41.824
<i>but he's sticking to his story
that he's just a businessman</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:43.287
in town for a convention.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.669
Here's the case that
he was spotted with.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.040
Alas... no machine gun.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.377
We've got no
physical evidence

16:50.426 --> 16:51.633
tying Alonzo
to the murders.

16:51.802 --> 16:52.946
It's almost like
he's a professional.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.006
Hmm.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.921
We have to find
something concrete.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.509
Otherwise, we gotta
let him go.

17:02.313 --> 17:05.477
And then everything
seemed fine for a second.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.434
Until Shepherd sent me
a key to a bunker

17:08.611 --> 17:10.603
filled with things
from Remi's life.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.215
<i>And that opened
the flood gates.</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:15.028
It was like...
Remi's thoughts,

17:15.201 --> 17:19.319
her emotions, were...
holding me hostage.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.537
Really? You don't have anything
to say after all of that?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.044
You told me to listen.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.127
<i>Forget it.</i>

17:27.338 --> 17:28.670
This was a mistake.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.090
You talk about Remi as if
she's a different person.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.630
She <i>is</i> a different person.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.128
How so?

17:36.347 --> 17:38.179
I didn't do all of those
horrible things!

17:38.349 --> 17:39.590
Of course you did.

17:40.810 --> 17:41.516
<i>You said you came to me</i>

17:41.686 --> 17:43.288
because I'm the only
therapist on the planet

17:43.312 --> 17:44.974
who knows both
you and Remi, right?

17:45.731 --> 17:48.144
Well... sit down

17:48.776 --> 17:50.003
and let me tell you
a little something

17:50.027 --> 17:51.268
about both of you.

17:54.365 --> 17:56.072
Jane left the apartment
today.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.733
- That's great.
- Yeah.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.484
Uh, it was
to see a therapist.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.369
Whatever she needs to do.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.493
So that therapist
is Borden.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.794
<i>She wanted me
to tell you</i>

18:07.837 --> 18:09.419
before you found out
from anyone else.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.380
Okay.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.883
Uh, I was...

18:15.886 --> 18:17.127
not expecting that,
but...

18:18.556 --> 18:20.969
I just want Jane back,
so whatever she needs.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.803
- Same here.
- Ditto.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.348
Three more HCI Global execs
are dead.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.916
Looks like Alonzo was even
busier than we thought.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.940
No, you don't understand...
these three were killed

18:30.026 --> 18:31.517
after we took Alonzo
into custody.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.188
What, so we've got
the wrong guy?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.696
No, we've finally found
Cortez's weapons

18:35.906 --> 18:37.113
stashed
in a hotel basement.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.319
He's the guy.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.824
Maybe they sent
a second assassin.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.234
This fast?
You said it yourself,

18:41.287 --> 18:42.527
Cortez is a one-man
death squad.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.703
Yeah, but,
Cartel or not,

18:44.248 --> 18:45.830
someone else
is on the war path.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.788
You can be honest
with us, Casey.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.940
<i>We're not the first meeting
you've had lately.</i>

18:51.964 --> 18:54.001
I'm telling you, the FBI
hasn't made a move for me.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.215
<i>Well, they will.</i>

18:55.384 --> 18:56.591
And when they do...

18:57.637 --> 18:59.173
you will be tempted
to cut a deal.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.054
I won't have
to cut a deal

19:01.307 --> 19:03.014
because they won't have
anything on me.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.675
The team that saved
Air Force One,

19:05.102 --> 19:06.982
they're very good,
and they will find something.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.901
And they're gonna come
after you looking for me.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.897
They're gonna offer you
a way out.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.274
<i>You will be
tempted to take it,</i>

19:12.443 --> 19:13.604
but I promise you,

19:13.861 --> 19:15.602
if you reject any offer
they make,

19:15.780 --> 19:17.646
even if it means
serving jail time,

19:17.823 --> 19:19.564
we are all gonna get
out of this scot-free.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.775
Please don't take this
the wrong way.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.610
How could you
guarantee that?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.155
You're just gonna have
to trust me on that one.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.823
Look, I don't know

19:28.000 --> 19:29.560
if you can still
pull off Helios or not,

19:29.710 --> 19:31.246
but I can tell you this,

19:31.629 --> 19:35.168
I will never make a deal
with the FBI.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.832
<i>Never.</i>

19:40.888 --> 19:43.471
So, you know how Zapata
uploaded some of the data

19:43.641 --> 19:46.304
off that SD card Madeline
stashed in Zurich?

19:46.394 --> 19:48.010
Yeah, but I thought
it was scrambled.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.146
Well, today's events
unscrambled a bit of it.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.098
The word "Helios" appears

19:53.275 --> 19:55.938
followed by half a dozen
present and former

19:56.112 --> 19:57.444
HCI Global execs.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.773
"Helios" mean
anything to you?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.967
No, but I'm guessing all those
execs were killed today.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.573
Exactamundo.
And here's a twist...

20:02.743 --> 20:04.735
they were all killed
after we brought in Alonzo.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.112
What, so Madeline was the one
that was killing them all?

20:07.498 --> 20:08.975
Okay, think about it,
you're Madeline.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.036
You're in hiding,
you have this kill list,

20:11.252 --> 20:12.896
but you're also wanted
for a thousand crimes

20:12.920 --> 20:14.360
and not looking
to up your rap sheet.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.204
But the cartel shows up,
gunning for you

20:16.340 --> 20:17.484
and the people
connected to you.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.988
And instead of running away
from them,

20:19.135 --> 20:20.501
you decide to use
the opportunity

20:20.678 --> 20:21.718
to cover
your own killings.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.593
So she got lemons and she made,
uh, super-bloody lemonade?

20:25.766 --> 20:27.132
Why would she kill
the only people

20:27.351 --> 20:28.967
that are willing
to help her, though?

20:29.145 --> 20:30.352
Because they know
too much.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.082
If we leverage them,
we could figure out

20:32.106 --> 20:34.018
where she is
and what she's up to.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.471
So this is
Madeline's final purge

20:35.609 --> 20:37.896
before she disappears
for good.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.940
Is there anyone on that list
that's still alive?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.571
Just one.

20:41.741 --> 20:42.948
Casey Marco.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.116
Thank you for speaking with me
in person, Casey.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.281
I guess I'm old-fashioned.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.478
I still believe in doing
things face-to-face.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.422
Well, I'm just glad we're
on the same page again.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.545
And I'm the same way.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.037
It always feels better
to be able

20:59.133 --> 21:00.253
to look someone in the eyes.

21:00.718 --> 21:01.718
I agree.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.387
Unfortunately, I saw
too much fear in yours.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.119
All right.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.575
That was the last
of your naughty list.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.540
Now what?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.703
Now we vanish.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.082
Yeah, Madeline
doesn't strike me

21:42.259 --> 21:43.699
as the type
to do her own strangling.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.803
Dominic?

21:44.887 --> 21:46.753
That'd be my guess,
but she was here, too.

21:48.599 --> 21:49.618
And with her
kill list complete,

21:49.642 --> 21:51.802
Madeline's next move will be
to get out of the country.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.225
Check this out.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.248
He was hiding a piece of paper
with a phone number

21:55.272 --> 21:56.683
and the word "fuchsia"
on it.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.974
That's not a phone number.
It's a pager.

21:59.568 --> 22:00.354
How can you tell
the difference?

22:00.528 --> 22:01.963
Because I've seen
a slip like that before.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.398
It belongs to Madeline's
pilot, J.B.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.511
That's the pilot
we used to track you.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.465
He's a pilot?
Yeah, yeah, James B. Kelley.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.887
His signature's on
a lot of these things.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.871
Flights and dates match up
with the places we know

22:11.038 --> 22:13.030
that Madeline and Zapata
have already been.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.698
It's how he communicates.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.241
You page him,
and he only responds

22:16.418 --> 22:18.626
when you send the correct code,
usually a color.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.207
And he changes it
frequently.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.441
Well, if that's still
his current pager number,

22:21.465 --> 22:22.705
we can use it
to track him down.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.759
If we can track him, that
might lead us to Madeline.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.462
You really think
there are two distinct

22:29.682 --> 22:31.890
and separate people
living in that body?

22:32.434 --> 22:33.925
Two minds?
Two hearts?

22:36.647 --> 22:38.604
Why don't you want
to answer the question?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.061
I thought
it was rhetorical.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.233
Hm. Your notion of Remi
as "the other"

22:45.406 --> 22:46.647
is just a construct.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.533
Remi was real.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.402
Yes, but the division
between you isn't.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.620
It's an invention,

22:53.038 --> 22:54.158
<i>designed to deflect
any blame</i>

22:54.331 --> 22:55.931
<i>you might feel
for the things you've done</i>

22:55.958 --> 22:57.574
<i>- in your past.</i>
- No, I...

22:57.751 --> 23:00.118
I came out of that bag
a clean slate.

23:01.839 --> 23:03.671
What you're going through,

23:03.841 --> 23:05.833
this anxiety
and paralysis,

23:06.468 --> 23:07.709
it's a schism...

23:07.887 --> 23:10.675
<i>caused by this most
basic rejection of reality.</i>

23:10.931 --> 23:13.389
<i>And it's time for you
to accept the truth.</i>

23:13.976 --> 23:15.808
That what, I'm a monster?

23:16.186 --> 23:18.303
<i>I always have been?
Always will be?</i>

23:18.439 --> 23:19.639
I know this isn't
easy to hear.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.084
<i>And it's something
you need to accept</i>

23:21.108 --> 23:22.144
<i>in order
to move forward.</i>

23:22.318 --> 23:24.059
No, the ZIP made me
a new person,

23:24.320 --> 23:26.061
a better person.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.652
That's just a narrative
fed to you by me.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.616
<i>If you had
come out of that bag</i>

23:31.785 --> 23:34.402
having to wrestle with all
the crimes you've committed,

23:34.747 --> 23:37.239
if the FBI had to treat you
as a criminal,

23:37.416 --> 23:38.623
it never would have worked.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.041
<i>You had to stay
a victim.</i>

23:41.503 --> 23:44.462
No. No.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.206
I'm not her.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.541
I'm not Remi!

23:51.597 --> 23:53.213
<i>The look on your face
right now,</i>

23:53.641 --> 23:54.641
<i>I've seen it before.</i>

23:55.017 --> 23:57.225
I saw it the first time
you came to me for help.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.304
When, after... after you
found me in Times Square?

24:00.606 --> 24:03.724
No, after my wife and I
found you in Afghanistan.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.315
What's so complicated?
She's hurt.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.945
I found her.
We have an obligation

24:14.119 --> 24:15.155
to treat her.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.246
See, I look at you now

24:17.414 --> 24:18.854
and I see the person
I met back then.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.310
<i>Sure, the hair's
a little different,</i>

24:20.334 --> 24:21.700
<i>the skin more illustrated.</i>

24:21.835 --> 24:24.418
But everything else
is essentially the same.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.081
<i>The fear,
the vulnerability,</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:29.382
the expression
on your face.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.242
You remember that day,
now don't you?

24:32.221 --> 24:34.383
I have to go. It's not safe
for you if I stay.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.867
- Wait, not safe how?
- What happened to you?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.011
Is there someone
we can call?

24:37.142 --> 24:38.782
Don't call anyone.
I just... I have to go.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.394
You will die on your own,
do you understand me?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.179
You're staying here
until you're well.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.724
No, please. Please.

24:50.072 --> 24:52.155
<i>I met this you
a long time ago.</i>

24:52.783 --> 24:54.399
When the love of my life

24:54.576 --> 24:56.533
was wiped off
the face of the planet.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.246
Chris?

24:59.373 --> 25:01.239
Chris? Chris!

25:01.417 --> 25:02.157
No!

25:02.334 --> 25:03.334
Chris!

25:03.419 --> 25:05.035
There is nothing
you can do!

25:06.630 --> 25:07.871
They're here for you!

25:08.924 --> 25:10.540
Because you came
into my life.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.255
<i>Not Alice Kruger.
Not Remi Briggs.</i>

25:13.595 --> 25:14.631
Not Jane Doe.

25:15.973 --> 25:16.973
Just you.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.806
- I'm sorry.
<i>- For what?</i>

25:23.480 --> 25:25.722
- For what I went through?
<i>- No.</i>

25:27.067 --> 25:28.729
No, for...

25:28.902 --> 25:30.484
bringing my enemies
into your life

25:30.654 --> 25:32.236
and changing it forever.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.092
I thought I could
make it right

25:34.116 --> 25:36.449
by recruiting you
to work for Shepherd,

25:36.618 --> 25:38.405
but I just made it worse.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.325
I'm really sorry
for what I did to you.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.700
Please say something.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.777
Doesn't it feel better
to talk about yourself

25:52.801 --> 25:53.882
as one person?

26:01.560 --> 26:05.270
James "J.B." Kelley
got his pilot's license at 15,

26:05.439 --> 26:08.807
spent over a decade
as a medevac pilot

26:08.984 --> 26:10.976
before Hank Crawford
recruited him

26:11.195 --> 26:12.276
to work at HCI Global.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.111
<i>J.B. has no family,
no roots.</i>

26:14.323 --> 26:15.563
He practically lives
in the sky.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.656
His only connection
to the ground is via that pager.

26:17.951 --> 26:18.611
<i>Can we trace it?</i>

26:18.786 --> 26:20.743
Well, it's an old-school,
one-way pager.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.074
It uses a radio network.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.683
I have no way of tracing it,
but I was hoping

26:23.707 --> 26:25.994
that maybe Boston
might know some tricks.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.872
So, once again,
you and Rich are stumped

26:28.045 --> 26:31.038
and need my infinite wisdom
to get you out of a jam.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.131
Can you track
a one-way pager or not?

26:35.886 --> 26:36.546
Not.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.006
Look, I say
we just call him.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.449
The pager might not
be traceable,

26:39.473 --> 26:40.617
but his callback number
could be.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.577
If we call J.B., we give up
the element of surprise.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.761
He'll know
we have his number.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.468
A number that's not
doing us any good.

26:45.646 --> 26:47.012
Our best play here
is to get him

26:47.189 --> 26:48.555
to give up his location.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.849
I'm with Tasha
on this one.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.442
Okay, let's reach out
and touch someone.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.195
Oh, sorry, heh.

26:56.573 --> 26:57.573
<i>Oh! Another sale.</i>

26:58.033 --> 26:59.969
At this rate, I won't have
anything left to exhibit.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.583
Selling for 90 bucks?
Oh, okay.

27:09.753 --> 27:10.914
I knew it.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.524
You're the one
who's buying Boston's art.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.629
<i>What? No.</i>

27:14.925 --> 27:16.837
Okay, yes.
But I can explain.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.967
Explain how this is
one big, vicious mind game?

27:19.513 --> 27:20.740
<i>The second that Boston
finds out</i>

27:20.764 --> 27:22.130
that he's not
making real sales,

27:22.307 --> 27:23.673
this is gonna devastate him.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.267
It's not a big mind game,
okay, numb nuts?

27:26.436 --> 27:28.302
I have a very good reason
for what I'm doing.

27:28.438 --> 27:29.974
- Okay.
- Look, the art world

27:30.107 --> 27:31.848
is not interested
in a reformed forger

27:31.984 --> 27:33.128
who's been out of
the legit game

27:33.152 --> 27:34.188
as long as Boston has.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.360
So I am just creating
a buzz, you know,

27:36.488 --> 27:37.528
getting his name
out there.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.695
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.364
Hey, wait a second.
Okay, listen.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.114
One could argue that

27:44.288 --> 27:46.128
Boston's life went
off the rails because of me.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.747
Okay? So it's the least
I could do.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.041
You say that now,
but I know you.

27:50.252 --> 27:52.790
You are your own worst enemy,
and I can guarantee you

27:53.005 --> 27:54.274
the second he pushes
one of your buttons,

27:54.298 --> 27:55.483
you're not gonna
be able to resist

27:55.507 --> 27:56.793
throwing this back
in his face.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.299
<i>And whenever that happens,</i>

27:58.427 --> 28:00.635
I don't know if he's ever
gonna be able to forgive you.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.466
If I was so bad,

28:06.685 --> 28:09.268
how can I ever truly
become good?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.158
I think you need to stop
looking at yourself

28:11.315 --> 28:13.147
through this prism
of good and bad.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.107
Then how should
I look at myself?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.276
All right,
when you joined Orion

28:17.446 --> 28:19.028
and then Sandstorm,

28:19.531 --> 28:21.318
you were on a search
for justice, correct?

28:21.825 --> 28:23.862
A pretty warped view
of justice.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.743
But justice nonetheless.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.153
You wanted to right
what you saw

28:27.247 --> 28:28.738
as a world of wrongs,

28:29.124 --> 28:30.894
which isn't all that different
from your role now

28:30.918 --> 28:32.034
at the FBI, is it?

28:33.378 --> 28:34.619
I guess not.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.421
It's just that now the...

28:38.133 --> 28:40.546
the wrongs I wanna correct
are my own.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.960
And that's a problem
because...

28:42.387 --> 28:44.174
There's so many of them.

28:44.348 --> 28:46.260
Too many to atone for.

28:46.433 --> 28:49.392
I... I don't even know
where to begin, and...

28:50.145 --> 28:51.852
when I think about it,

28:52.564 --> 28:54.897
it just completely
paralyzes me.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.229
Well, let me
tell you a story

28:57.402 --> 28:59.394
someone once told me
when I was in a dark place.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.862
<i>A boy walks along a beach,</i>

29:02.032 --> 29:04.740
when he comes across
a thousand starfish,

29:04.910 --> 29:05.950
all washed up
on the shore,

29:06.286 --> 29:07.948
<i>baking in the sun,
dying.</i>

29:08.121 --> 29:09.657
So he picks one up

29:09.831 --> 29:12.323
and he throws it back
into the sea, saves it.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.167
<i>A man walks up to the boy
and says,</i>

29:15.337 --> 29:17.499
"You can't save
every starfish on this beach.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.393
- It's impossible."
- And then the boy says,

29:19.633 --> 29:22.467
"No... but I can
save that one."

29:23.762 --> 29:24.762
I told you that story

29:24.930 --> 29:26.341
when we were fleeing
Afghanistan

29:26.515 --> 29:28.427
to get you
to join Sandstorm.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.305
Regardless of your intent,
it was still good advice.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.558
<i>Stop thinking
about the whole beach.</i>

29:34.773 --> 29:36.730
Just focus on what
you can save.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.528
It's J.B.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.030
He's calling back.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.497
<i>Good?</i>

29:51.832 --> 29:52.832
Yeah.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.001
J.B.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.980
<i>This is a voice I thought
I'd never hear again.</i>

29:57.004 --> 29:58.120
Is this traceable?

29:58.297 --> 30:00.038
Yeah, Madeline and I
had a falling out.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.706
Not easily,
but I have my ways.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.820
But that doesn't mean that
we can't still be friends.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.882
<i>Hm. Yeah, do friends try
to trace each other's calls?</i>

30:07.055 --> 30:08.241
<i>By the time you get
a read on me,</i>

30:08.265 --> 30:09.534
<i>I'll be halfway
across the globe.</i>

30:09.558 --> 30:10.969
<i>- So, buh-bye.</i>
- Wait!

30:11.143 --> 30:12.143
You're in danger.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.249
<i>And what,
you're gonna help me?</i>

30:14.354 --> 30:15.790
<i>I heard the Sabinito Cartel
already made</i>

30:15.814 --> 30:16.958
<i>one attempt
on your life today.</i>

30:16.982 --> 30:18.459
Yeah, and Madeline and I
weren't the only people

30:18.483 --> 30:20.725
in Mexico who met up with them...
you were there, too.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.269
You think you don't
have a target on your back?

30:23.488 --> 30:24.899
<i>Madeline'll protect me.</i>

30:25.073 --> 30:27.235
Just like she protected
Casey Marco?

30:27.409 --> 30:29.867
And all her other allies
she killed today?

30:30.495 --> 30:33.784
What happens when you outlive
your usefulness?

30:35.917 --> 30:37.158
You've got one path
to safety.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.335
Come and help us
take down Madeline.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.662
<i>Fine. I'll come in.</i>

30:43.133 --> 30:44.340
<i>For $10 million.</i>

30:44.926 --> 30:46.042
We can't do that.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.197
Look, if he's really got
something, it's worth it.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.632
Even if he does,
getting $10 million

30:49.848 --> 30:51.208
out of the FBI
ain't gonna be easy.

30:51.391 --> 30:52.391
Aw, come on, J.B.

30:52.476 --> 30:53.476
That's a big price to pay

30:53.518 --> 30:55.259
when we don't even know
what we're getting.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.623
<i>What if I told you
exactly how Madeline's</i>

30:57.647 --> 30:59.889
<i>getting out of the country
and when?</i>

31:02.235 --> 31:04.067
Then I'd say
you've got a deal.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.785
You're doing the right thing
coming in, J.B.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.246
Where's Madeline?

31:17.542 --> 31:18.542
<i>So what is this?</i>

31:18.668 --> 31:19.408
Coordinates?

31:19.628 --> 31:20.789
Nah, it's my Bitcoin wallet.

31:21.338 --> 31:23.580
Soon as I see 10 million in it,
I'll start talking.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.418
The deal was money
for intel.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.583
<i>How's Madeline getting
out of the country?</i>

31:27.761 --> 31:29.218
We need the intel
before the FBI

31:29.388 --> 31:31.468
- can authorize this transfer.
<i>- You're right.</i>

31:31.765 --> 31:33.405
Madeline's leaving
the country in an hour.

31:33.558 --> 31:34.758
You got one chance to get her.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.095
And that one chance is gonna
cost you $10 million.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.688
It's that simple.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.812
You know this guy.
Can we trust him?

31:43.944 --> 31:45.864
I think right now he's
the best chance we've got.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.990
- Come on with me.
- Okay.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.742
Wait a second.
You can't go.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.202
Madeline's still
out there.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.645
Yeah, but she's
leaving the country.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.160
But she could
still find you.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.981
Just hang on for a little bit.
It's fun out here.

32:04.005 --> 32:05.725
It's Make Your Own Pasta Day.
Wait a second!

32:05.757 --> 32:07.151
You remember when you were
trying to steal my job?

32:07.175 --> 32:08.611
You could do that again.
That was fun.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.467
All right, okay.
I see what's happening here.

32:10.971 --> 32:11.757
- You do?
- Yeah.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.964
You don't want me to
go back to my art career

32:14.057 --> 32:16.344
because you can't stand
how successful I am

32:16.560 --> 32:18.037
now that I'm out from
under your shadow.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.497
That could not be
further from the truth.

32:19.521 --> 32:20.957
I love that you're finally
getting your due.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.722
You are so transparent,

32:22.899 --> 32:24.515
I can see
your uvula piercing.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.693
- Wha...
- You are oozing jealousy right now.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.071
- You hate that I don't need you.
<i>- Okay.</i>

32:30.282 --> 32:32.069
Well, hold on, hold...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.908
- Okay, if you only knew...
- What?

32:35.078 --> 32:36.838
That I've always been
the ace up your sleeve?

32:36.997 --> 32:39.284
That it's always me coming in
at the last second to save

32:39.458 --> 32:40.768
your unflattering
pants-wearing ass?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.624
- Yeah, well...
- Face it, Rich.

32:43.170 --> 32:46.254
Without me,
you'd be nothing.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.340
I would be nothing?

32:48.383 --> 32:49.986
You know what?
Without me, you know where you would be?

32:50.010 --> 32:51.672
No, please, tell me.
Tell me your cutting,

32:51.803 --> 32:53.419
pop-culture reliant
retort.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.174
Who am I from
<i>Caroline in the City</i> ?

32:55.348 --> 32:56.429
- You...
- I need your help.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.327
I need you to make it look
like this account

32:58.351 --> 33:00.311
just received an influx of
$10 million in Bitcoin.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.797
And I stress the words
"look like."

33:01.855 --> 33:03.166
<i>I don't need it to be
a real deposit.</i>

33:03.190 --> 33:04.522
<i>I need it to appear legit.</i>

33:04.733 --> 33:05.918
I need you to do it
in five minutes.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.228
Well, on that
kind of deadline,

33:07.360 --> 33:09.022
it would probably take
the both of us.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.318
Okay, I'll stay and help.
For Assistant Director Reade.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.491
Understood.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.418
Have you ever considered
wearing a turtleneck?

33:16.536 --> 33:17.777
Something to think about.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.166
All right.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.418
What you're going through
isn't as unusual as it seems.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.292
Sure, the details
are extraordinary, but...

33:29.716 --> 33:31.673
family drama
is family drama.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.927
And combat-induced trauma
is combat-induced trauma.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.033
<i>Underneath it all,
we're just dealing with</i>

33:37.057 --> 33:38.389
<i>good old-fashioned PTSD.</i>

33:38.517 --> 33:39.598
And that's
a good thing,

33:39.809 --> 33:41.489
because there are proven
treatments for it.

33:41.811 --> 33:42.811
<i>No, I hear you.</i>

33:43.230 --> 33:44.641
It just feels
so impossible.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.065
<i>It isn't.</i>

33:46.566 --> 33:48.307
It isn't easy,
either.

33:49.110 --> 33:50.692
But you have the strength
to do it.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.061
<i>I know you.</i>

33:52.280 --> 33:53.737
<i>ZIP'd or not,
the one constant</i>

33:53.949 --> 33:56.191
<i>throughout your whole life
has been your strength.</i>

33:56.701 --> 33:58.061
If it helps,
think about your team.

33:58.119 --> 33:59.119
Think about Kurt.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.203
<i>How much they need you.</i>

34:03.500 --> 34:06.618
It feels good to be needed,
doesn't it?

34:11.841 --> 34:13.878
Not gonna lie, I'm surprised
you're still alive.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.217
That makes
two of us.

34:18.181 --> 34:19.592
All right, it's done.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.599
I'm impressed.

34:26.773 --> 34:27.917
You know, for a second there
I was worried

34:27.940 --> 34:29.306
I was gonna have to
lower my price.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.728
Okay. Madeline is leaving
the country on a private jet

34:33.905 --> 34:35.521
out of Westchester
in 50 minutes.

34:38.618 --> 34:39.618
How do you know that?

34:41.788 --> 34:43.947
'Cause I'm the guy who's
supposed to be flying her out.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.663
All right,
Watchtower's ready.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.123
Bear Trap is ready.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.984
Wait a second, why don't we
have a cool code name?

34:53.007 --> 34:55.670
Uh, Pistol Shrimps
are ready.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.174
<i>Are you sure we should be</i>

35:00.348 --> 35:01.805
depending so much on
one person?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.682
You can count on J.B.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.096
How can you be
so sure?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.728
Because J.B. would never bite
the hand that feeds him.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.349
- It's been an hour.
- Relax.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.338
<i>Listen, I always keep
my plane's bar</i>

35:14.362 --> 35:15.673
<i>fully stocked...
you want a drink?</i>

35:15.697 --> 35:16.778
She should
be here by now.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.468
Madeline keeps her own time.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.282
<i>No, not for
something like this.</i>

35:20.452 --> 35:21.452
<i>She'll be here.</i>

35:21.578 --> 35:23.490
He's lying.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.122
What?

35:25.290 --> 35:27.351
- <i>You're being conned.</i>
- How do you know that?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.295
Well, because he's saying
everything I would say.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.872
I mean, listen to him.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.497
How quick he is to dismiss
Madeline's lateness.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.548
Not breaking a sweat
that she might not show.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.001
He has too little doubt.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.928
You know, Bob Ross over here
is making some decent points.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.513
You still don't
believe me? Here.

35:43.725 --> 35:44.932
Let's run an experiment.

35:45.185 --> 35:48.394
To catch a con, you gotta hatch a con.
Remember?

35:48.647 --> 35:50.434
Zapata?
Boston has a theory.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.397
There's something
we want you to say to J.B.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.643
Uh-huh, copy that.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.940
That was Watchtower.
Get ready.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.442
Madeline just arrived.

35:59.824 --> 36:00.824
She wha...

36:06.081 --> 36:07.617
You were never
expecting her to show.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.749
What if I told you exactly how
Madeline's getting out of the country?

36:10.919 --> 36:12.205
<i>And when.</i>

36:12.420 --> 36:13.877
Then I'd say
you've got a deal.

36:16.383 --> 36:17.383
Good work.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.383
<i>Is this one giant stall?</i>

36:19.803 --> 36:21.923
Keep us looking one way
while Madeline runs the other?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.635
Ah, it's too late now.
You'll never catch her.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.351
How 'bout that drink?

36:33.858 --> 36:35.975
State police has
checkpoints on highways,

36:36.152 --> 36:37.832
and I've got my algorithms
working overtime

36:37.862 --> 36:40.320
on airports, seaports,
and traffic cams.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.652
If Madeline or Dominic
are spotted anywhere

36:42.784 --> 36:44.241
near a method of
mass transportation,

36:44.369 --> 36:45.826
they will be detected.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.765
What about non-commercial
helipads and runways?

36:47.789 --> 36:49.530
We convinced the FAA
to issue a code red,

36:49.708 --> 36:51.388
which grounds all
the aircraft in the area.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.284
Really?
That is impressive.

36:53.503 --> 36:55.665
But if all the aircraft
is grounded,

36:56.381 --> 36:57.588
what are these blue dots?

36:57.757 --> 37:00.500
Uh, those are medical
evacuation choppers.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.251
<i>They're not affected by
a code red.</i>

37:02.429 --> 37:03.761
Does anyone else
find it curious

37:03.930 --> 37:05.171
that J.B. was a medevac pilot,

37:05.432 --> 37:07.192
and that's the only aircraft
still in flight?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.744
<i>So we need to know
who's flying</i>

37:08.768 --> 37:10.488
those medevac choppers.
We need to know now.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.469
Okay, getting
a read on every pilot

37:12.647 --> 37:14.513
currently heading into
the city.

37:14.691 --> 37:18.059
Cross-referencing that with all
of J.B.'s known flight history.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.486
We've got a match.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.317
There's an inbound copter
being flown by

37:22.532 --> 37:24.774
J.B.'s old co-pilot
from his medevac days.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.751
<i>This is how she's
getting out of here.</i>

37:26.828 --> 37:29.241
A medical chopper performing
a bogus rescue mission.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.174
It's heading to Brooklyn
West Medical Center.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.915
Okay, so that is
the extraction point.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.201
Let's move.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.629
- <i>Jane! Hey.</i>
- Hey.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.258
Does this mean...

37:41.301 --> 37:42.792
Yeah.
I'm back.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.754
Look, recovery
is gonna be a process, but...

37:47.056 --> 37:48.056
I'm ready for it.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.635
You ready to get
back in the field?

37:49.809 --> 37:51.537
- I thought you'd never ask.
<i>- All right, let's go.</i>

37:51.561 --> 37:52.802
Fill you in on the way.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.018
Where are we going?

37:54.230 --> 37:55.471
To take down Madeline.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.684
Wait, seriously?

37:57.442 --> 37:58.933
How long have
I been gone?

38:08.661 --> 38:10.448
FBI just entered the lobby!

38:12.665 --> 38:13.768
They're headed
towards the roof.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.500
You make sure that helicopter
gets here before they do. Go!

38:17.128 --> 38:17.959
You, stay!

38:18.129 --> 38:19.620
Everyone else,
come with me!

38:24.719 --> 38:26.210
<i>Hey! FBI, FBI.</i>

38:26.387 --> 38:28.253
<i>Find somewhere safe,
lock the doors.</i>

38:28.431 --> 38:29.922
Ready?

38:30.099 --> 38:31.431
Go, go.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.228
Back! Back!

38:41.402 --> 38:42.402
<i>We'll take these guys.</i>

38:42.529 --> 38:44.145
You two find another way
to the roof.

38:53.832 --> 38:54.868
Uhh!

39:11.933 --> 39:12.764
Holster your gun.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.675
On my signal,
run for the roof.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.635
- What are you doing?
- This!

39:17.063 --> 39:18.383
Get down!

40:15.955 --> 40:17.912
Oh!

40:19.250 --> 40:20.250
Madeline Burke...

40:24.422 --> 40:25.708
You're under arrest.

40:29.177 --> 40:31.030
<i>I've got Madeline.
I'm bringing her down.</i>

40:31.054 --> 40:32.170
And on that note,

40:32.388 --> 40:33.799
looks like
I'm a free man.

40:34.223 --> 40:35.223
Again.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.888
Well, this was fun.
And then it was tedious.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.267
And then I left.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.019
Wait, hey, Boston,
wait up.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.399
I-I gotta
tell you something.

40:48.821 --> 40:50.608
I'm really proud of you.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.948
And all your success.
Truly.

40:56.579 --> 40:57.579
Thank you.

41:00.416 --> 41:02.408
All right, everyone.
Check your inboxes

41:02.627 --> 41:04.539
for invites to my exhibition.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.295
If you don't find them,
just check your spam folders.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.956
Okay?

41:09.258 --> 41:10.999
Oh, uh, Rich...

41:11.511 --> 41:14.754
I had no idea your apartment
had so much empty wall space.

41:15.348 --> 41:16.348
Hmm.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.932
Wait... he knows
you're buying his art?

41:23.523 --> 41:25.167
- Yeah, I guess so.
<i>- Wait, so...</i>

41:25.191 --> 41:27.478
he knows, and you know
that he knows,

41:27.694 --> 41:29.856
but neither of you are
saying anything about it?

41:32.073 --> 41:33.109
I love us.

41:34.117 --> 41:34.823
Ugh.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.032
Tasha, what's your 20?

41:45.628 --> 41:46.869
Right here.

41:49.048 --> 41:50.459
Jane, where are you?

41:53.302 --> 41:54.863
Just finishing up
with Madeline's friends.

41:54.887 --> 41:56.094
<i>I'll meet you in the lobby.</i>

41:56.180 --> 41:57.261
Meet you down there.

41:57.473 --> 41:58.884
It's nice to
have you back.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.859
Greg, move your head!
