WEBVTT

00:00.201 --> 00:05.337
Iron man:  <i>Okay, avengers,</i>
<i>we've just entered</i>
<i>latverian airspace.</i>

00:05.339 --> 00:08.774
Hawkeye:  <i>Why are</i>
<i>we wasting our time?</i>
<i>Doom's gone.</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:12.644
He rode that midgard serpent
into a great, big portal
to nowhere. We won.

00:12.646 --> 00:16.381
And ever since, hydra
had its eyes on his
weapons cache.

00:16.383 --> 00:20.752
But we picked up
seismic readings from
the capital this morning.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.955
Asgardian energy signatures
all over the place.

00:22.957 --> 00:25.324
Something big is
going on down there.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.659
Asgardian?
That's your department.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.761
(jets roar)

00:30.296 --> 00:32.264
Any ideas what
we're heading into?

00:32.266 --> 00:33.632
None that would
make sense.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.866
Well, that's encouraging.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.335
(loud crash)
(grunts)

00:36.337 --> 00:38.270
Heads up!
(grunts)

00:38.272 --> 00:40.305
Where'd that come from?

00:40.307 --> 00:42.608
Black widow:
Ground fire!
We've been hit!

00:44.377 --> 00:46.311
We're going down, people.

00:48.915 --> 00:50.249
(grunts)

00:50.650 --> 00:51.984
Huh?

00:51.986 --> 00:53.585
(computer whirs)

00:53.587 --> 00:56.288
Captain america:
Hydra and a.I.M.?
This is not good.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.323
Looks like s.H.I.E.L.D.
Lost control of the border.

00:58.325 --> 00:59.758
They want to play?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.393
Let's play!

01:01.395 --> 01:02.861
(hulk roars)

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.604 --> 01:14.273
Ha! I didn't even
do anything yet.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.576
Wait! I don't think it's you
they're running from,
big green.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.551
Iron man: Buckle up.
We're about to eat
doom's front lawn.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.388
(strains)

01:34.494 --> 01:36.495
Odin's beard, no!

01:37.297 --> 01:38.997
The destroyer!

01:42.935 --> 01:44.369
(growls)

01:49.075 --> 01:51.009
Black widow:
The destroyer?

01:51.011 --> 01:54.546
It took out the hulk like
he was the incredible
nothing.

01:54.548 --> 01:59.017
Asgardian super-weapon,
bad, really bad, odin's
beard bad.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.055
Doom:  <i>You have tread</i>
<i>upon the sovereign</i>
<i>ground of latveria.</i>

02:03.423 --> 02:07.092
My eyes must be
going, "is that the
destroyer or doom?"

02:07.460 --> 02:10.562
Doom:  <i>Prepare to</i>
<i>face your doom.</i>

02:16.369 --> 02:18.670
Thor, you're our resident
asgardian tour guide.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.572
How do we shut
this thing down?

02:20.574 --> 02:22.574
Heimdall, open the bifrost!

02:28.047 --> 02:32.050
Did our best hope of stopping
this thing just leave town?

02:47.100 --> 02:51.670
Jarvis, tell me thor did not
just do what I think he did.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.039
Jarvis:  <i>Regrettably, sir.</i>
<i>The energy signatures</i>
<i>would suggest</i>

02:54.041 --> 02:55.741
<i>That thor's</i>
<i>no longer on this planet.</i>

02:55.743 --> 02:58.877
He must've gone to asgard
for help, only explanation.

02:58.879 --> 03:04.916
Tell the red skull
that doom shall soon visit
his vengeance upon him!

03:05.718 --> 03:07.786
(indistinct shouting)

03:08.955 --> 03:11.490
Doom:  <i>You're not</i>
<i>worthy of my rule.</i>

03:12.526 --> 03:16.628
Whatever his self-doubts are,
he's not going to leave us
in a lurch.

03:16.630 --> 03:21.833
And doomstroyer
here just put himself
at the head of the line.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.770
Doomstroyer, really?
We're calling it that?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.872
Okay, works
for me.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.509
Hit him hard!
Hit him fast!
Hit him a lot!

03:34.714 --> 03:37.616
Could you be
a little more specific?
The usual isn't working!

03:38.084 --> 03:40.619
Black widow: You can
start by staying out of his
face blasts.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.758
Less talking.
More fighting.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.499
Iron man,
how about some stats?
Any weak points?

03:55.001 --> 04:00.672
<i>Fools! I have no weakness.</i>
<i>I wield a weapon of asgard.</i>

04:01.007 --> 04:04.709
<i>I am the most powerful being</i>
<i>in all of the nine realms.</i>

04:04.711 --> 04:09.714
I am the most powerful being
in the whole nine whatevers!

04:13.119 --> 04:16.887
Doom, first the
midgard serpent,
now the destroyer?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.923
What's with the
asgardian obsession?

04:18.926 --> 04:22.661
<i>Is that jealousy</i>
<i>I hear, stark?</i>

04:22.663 --> 04:25.964
<i>Thanks to you and the aid</i>
<i>of your friends,</i>

04:25.966 --> 04:31.603
<i>I have visited worlds,</i>
<i>seen wonders beyond</i>
<i>any earthly intellect.</i>

04:31.605 --> 04:33.839
And evidently, stolen a few.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.474
(grunts)

04:43.916 --> 04:45.750
Big, powerful weapons,
like the destroyer,

04:45.752 --> 04:48.787
Have a tendency to be missed
by their big, powerful owners.

04:48.789 --> 04:53.825
<i>You refer to the</i>
<i>all-seeing father odin</i>
<i>in his eternal slumber?</i>

04:53.827 --> 04:56.795
<i>Or his belligerent,</i>
<i>witless son thor,</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:59.130
<i>The one you put</i>
<i>so much faith in?</i>

04:59.132 --> 05:01.166
<i>Neither can stop me now.</i>

05:01.168 --> 05:03.268
Hulk: You talk too much,
metal head.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.703
(growls)

05:04.705 --> 05:06.004
(laughs)
black widow: The town!

05:08.107 --> 05:09.207
(people screaming)

05:09.209 --> 05:10.542
This is wrong.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.177
For all his "take over
the world" talk,

05:12.179 --> 05:14.246
Doom always protected
his own people.

05:14.248 --> 05:17.015
I'm hacking the latverian
emergency system.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.885
Broadcasting evacuation
in all the local dialects.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.786
But we need
to draw his fire.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.656
(hulk roars)

05:24.658 --> 05:26.258
And calling for us
to make a tactical...

05:26.260 --> 05:28.727
Do not say, "retreat."

05:28.729 --> 05:31.630
Think of it as
smashing backwards.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.869
<i>You dare set foot</i>
<i>in my home!</i>

05:40.940 --> 05:42.574
(strains)

05:48.749 --> 05:52.717
Everything in here is designed
to vaporize an intruder.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.619
And guess what we are.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.722
Activating doom's defenses.
Stasis fields.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.492
Adamantium gates.
Laser grids.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.893
That should slow him
down a bit.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.328
<i>Fools!</i>

06:03.863 --> 06:06.631
<i>You can't turn my own</i>
<i>weapons against me!</i>

06:09.035 --> 06:11.036
Okay, I'm going
to say it.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.804
We are doomed.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.739
We need to take
this attack to him.

06:14.741 --> 06:18.677
You got a plan that can
stop asgardian weaponry,
I'm all ears.

06:20.947 --> 06:22.847
Then it is good
that I have one.

06:24.216 --> 06:26.184
We're glad you're back,
but where did you go?

06:26.652 --> 06:27.953
Sweet entrance.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.188
Why is everyone
so excited?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.991
My friends, I am sorry
I vanished on you.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.995
But after seeing the
destroyer, I hastened to
asgard to bring help.

06:36.997 --> 06:40.365
Who? Lady sif?
The warriors three?

06:40.367 --> 06:43.735
I believe you know
my brother, loki.

06:43.737 --> 06:48.006
Greetings, avengers,
good to see you again.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.278
Loki? Are you serious?

06:53.280 --> 06:56.348
Yeah, 'cause this situation
is not insane enough already.

06:56.682 --> 06:59.618
No, because loki
is our only hope.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.819
(walls rumble)

07:00.821 --> 07:02.854
Doom's broken through
the outer defenses.

07:04.957 --> 07:06.024
Stay behind me.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.893
<i>All of you burn!</i>

07:10.296 --> 07:11.830
(strains)

07:22.775 --> 07:24.075
(grunts)

07:25.711 --> 07:26.978
Didn't see
that coming.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.315
So will you be bowing
to me now or later?

07:30.317 --> 07:33.351
I'll also accept
a simple thank you,
then bowing.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.054
Thank you? You probably
gave doom that thing.

07:36.656 --> 07:39.724
And here I thought we let
bygones be bygones.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.426
(grunts)

07:42.128 --> 07:45.363
I am not behind von doom's
recent outbreak.

07:45.365 --> 07:49.100
The means to indwell
the armor had long
since been lost.

07:49.102 --> 07:54.139
If doom has rediscovered
its secrets, then we
are all at risk.

07:55.908 --> 08:00.445
I am here because my
brother thought you
mortals could help us.

08:00.447 --> 08:04.783
If we do not act, earth
and all the nine realms
will fall.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.719
Loki...
Is the biggest liar
in all of them.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.389
This was a waste
of time, brother.

08:11.391 --> 08:15.226
It is only a matter of hours
before the destroyer consumes
doom's psyche.

08:16.028 --> 08:19.831
Psyche? Wait, are you
saying doom's not actually
inside the armor?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.900
Doom is running
the weapon by...

08:22.101 --> 08:25.236
Oh, what's your term?
Remote control?

08:25.238 --> 08:32.277
Fortunately, I am adept
enough to track the energies
to doom's true location.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.113
Then why don't I smash
the location out of you.

08:35.115 --> 08:39.818
Even if you could,
you primates have no hope
of getting there without me.

08:39.985 --> 08:43.855
Translation, you'd get your
butt handed to you if you
went alone.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.157
Friends, I am
responsible for this.

08:46.759 --> 08:50.095
Had I faced the
midgard serpent
and my destiny,

08:50.097 --> 08:53.098
Doom would not have the
power he now possesses.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.734
I do not ask you
to trust my brother.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.036
I only ask you
to trust me.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.051
Okay, two teams.
Thor, this is your party.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.020
Take cap and falcon
to keep an eye on loki.

09:16.022 --> 09:19.324
Find doom and stop him
by any means necessary.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.393
Hulk, hawkeye, widow,
we're defense.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.230
We'll hold off the doomstroyer
as long as we can.

09:25.431 --> 09:29.000
Defense? Do I look like
a defender to you?

09:31.137 --> 09:32.203
(grunts)

09:33.172 --> 09:36.207
I trust loki about as far
as jarvis can throw him.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.110
Then it is well
the hulk remains with you.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.320
(strains)

09:52.191 --> 09:53.491
Helheim?

09:53.993 --> 09:55.160
Doom is here?

09:55.162 --> 09:56.461
Loki: So it
would seem.

09:57.164 --> 10:02.267
We are deep below asgard
in the domain of the trolls.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.535
Take heed.

10:03.537 --> 10:06.404
Trolls? As in trolls?

10:06.406 --> 10:10.008
Troll:
The odinson himself?
Sound the alarm!

10:10.010 --> 10:12.310
Destroy them!
Destroy them all!

10:12.312 --> 10:14.212
(trolls yell)

10:29.328 --> 10:31.329
You're not as sneaky
as you thought, eh, loki?

10:32.064 --> 10:33.164
Loki?

10:33.166 --> 10:36.034
Okay, actually you're
pretty sneaky.

10:42.875 --> 10:46.110
Why do I think I got
the short end of the
"split up the team" stick?

10:48.180 --> 10:50.148
Anything thor can
smash, I can...

10:50.150 --> 10:51.583
(grunting)

10:52.084 --> 10:54.118
Not sure about
this plan.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.287
What if separating us
is what loki wanted?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.590
Guess we'll have to trust
thor on this one.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.060
(bow clicks)

11:02.062 --> 11:03.294
(grunts)

11:03.296 --> 11:04.462
Use a little help here!

11:04.464 --> 11:06.464
Stark, what are you doing?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.132
Being awesome.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.076
I just activated doom's
internal defense systems.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.411
Oh, I also canceled
his digital movie queue.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.380
(all grunting)

11:25.050 --> 11:26.484
Thor: I have no time for this!

11:33.158 --> 11:35.193
(trolls cry out)

11:35.895 --> 11:37.128
Where's loki?

11:39.231 --> 11:42.133
He went awol the moment
the hostiles attacked.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.203
Falcon: Who needs him?
We're avengers!

11:47.106 --> 11:48.306
(screams)

11:48.308 --> 11:50.008
Loki led us
into a trap.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.976
We're probably
nowhere near doom.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.913
This would explain loki's
gutless retreat.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.547
Loki: Retreat?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.016
Why, I'm hurt.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.151
Had I not gone after
this troll messenger,

12:00.153 --> 12:03.154
We'd all be up
to our necks in axes.

12:03.156 --> 12:07.158
And I would not have been able
to discover this.

12:10.396 --> 12:14.132
Thor: The vault of geirrodur!
The very seat of troll power.

12:14.134 --> 12:19.237
Victor von doom!
Cease your assault upon
earth or face my wrath!

12:19.239 --> 12:22.206
So say the sons of asgard!

12:24.009 --> 12:25.576
Loki: He can't hear you.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.314
He sits upon the helhorn,
the destroyer's original
power source.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.382
Lost long ago to father.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.017
And that crown
doom is wearing?

12:33.019 --> 12:35.320
Loki: That I cannot say.

12:35.721 --> 12:38.122
If we break doom's connection
to the throne...

12:38.124 --> 12:40.425
The destroyer becomes
an inert husk.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.262
And you'll return to another
pathetic earth hero's welcome.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.265
Fly over some lava
and take down a napping
super villain.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.700
Now, can it be that easy?

12:48.702 --> 12:50.268
(rumbling)
whoa!

12:50.636 --> 12:52.303
(creature roars)

13:00.045 --> 13:03.081
Thor: It can't be.
Doom is protected by...

13:03.083 --> 13:04.482
(roars)

13:07.019 --> 13:09.387
Midgard serpent!

13:12.524 --> 13:14.025
Falcon: Why isn't
he eating doom?

13:14.159 --> 13:15.426
(roars)

13:16.462 --> 13:20.598
Doom has tamed
the midgard serpent?
Impressive.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.101
You're not going to fight
that thing, are you?

13:23.103 --> 13:28.473
Aye, no matter how many times
my destiny is altered, I am.

13:30.776 --> 13:32.176
(grunts)

13:32.178 --> 13:34.345
This is why you
wanted thor.

13:34.347 --> 13:38.483
You knew doom
gained control of
the midgard serpent.

13:38.485 --> 13:42.720
I promised to take him
to doom and so I have.

13:43.355 --> 13:44.722
(grunting)

13:48.594 --> 13:50.595
Thor, you don't have
to do this alone.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.097
I do and willingly.

13:53.766 --> 13:58.369
For the sake of the
nine realms, I must.
Thank you, brother.

13:59.304 --> 14:03.574
Now, come, foul worm.
Let us embrace!

14:05.511 --> 14:06.577
(yells)

14:08.814 --> 14:10.348
(grunts)

14:12.451 --> 14:15.253
(all grunting)

14:20.559 --> 14:23.161
I say we cut out
and let doom have
his home back?

14:27.633 --> 14:30.334
<i>My land's infested</i>
<i>with parasites.</i>

14:30.469 --> 14:32.603
<i>The only way</i>
<i>to defend latveria</i>

14:32.605 --> 14:36.307
<i>Is to extend its borders</i>
<i>to the ends of the earth!</i>

14:38.343 --> 14:40.778
World domination,
knew that was coming.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.580
Tony, doom
is losing it.

14:42.582 --> 14:47.518
He's a tyrant,
but he's always been insanely
protective of his own people.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.620
Doesn't look like
he wants to be re-elected.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.355
Maybe the doctor needs
a wake-up call.

14:51.357 --> 14:55.493
Okay, everybody,
new plan, strike
and retreat, rapid fire.

14:55.495 --> 14:59.464
It's only going to rile
him up and make him
more... Oh, I get it.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.698
Stupid plan.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.633
Sounds fun.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.503
(hulk roars)

15:11.543 --> 15:13.177
Hawkeye:
I got to say,
this is kind of fun.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.278
You're weird.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.346
Iron man: Victor,
up here.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.514
Jealous this!

15:19.218 --> 15:20.518
Avengers, heads up!

15:20.853 --> 15:22.520
Hawkeye: Technically
heads down.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.755
A pun? Should have
let it crush you.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.390
(cries out)

15:28.127 --> 15:29.460
(grunts)

15:30.129 --> 15:33.564
<i>You have defiled</i>
<i>my nation!</i>

15:33.566 --> 15:35.800
No, we've been
trying to save it.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.535
You've been destroying it.

15:40.572 --> 15:43.841
<i>No. I was defending my...</i>

15:43.843 --> 15:48.546
<i>My lands, my kingdom,</i>
<i>my people.</i>

15:49.649 --> 15:54.819
Iron man:
Decades of glory, victor,
wiped out in a day by you.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.256
What did you expect when you
merged with the destroyer?

16:02.261 --> 16:03.628
(metal creaks)

16:10.235 --> 16:12.703
(gasps)
no!

16:16.208 --> 16:18.342
The avengers? Here?

16:18.344 --> 16:21.479
Doom's connection
broken? How?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.514
You obviously haven't hung
around tony stark enough.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.250
He has a way of driving
anybody out of their mind.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.753
Team defense did
their job. Now it's
our turn.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.688
Falcon, I could
use an airlift.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.291
Buckle up.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.231
(roars)

16:40.233 --> 16:42.433
Doom must not reconnect
to the destroyer.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.703
If that buffoon
regains his focus,
all this is for nothing.

16:48.740 --> 16:52.343
To me, beast! You shall
not hurt my brother.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.578
(gasps)

16:53.580 --> 16:54.579
Huh?

16:54.581 --> 16:55.913
(strains)

16:59.218 --> 17:00.585
(thor yells)

17:00.587 --> 17:04.488
Adopted brother.
Let's get this done,
shall we?

17:05.824 --> 17:07.724
(roars)
(yells)

17:09.661 --> 17:10.694
(grunts)

17:12.698 --> 17:14.598
Away from me, you fools!

17:14.833 --> 17:16.334
(grunts)

17:18.737 --> 17:20.238
Ah!

17:22.941 --> 17:24.575
You've been dethroned.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.742
(grunts)

17:25.744 --> 17:27.645
The crown! No!

17:28.847 --> 17:30.414
(grunting)

17:32.818 --> 17:34.285
(roars)

17:37.656 --> 17:39.657
You never fail
to surprise me, brother.

17:39.659 --> 17:44.762
And you never fail to
disappoint me with your
ability to cheat death.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.665
Doom: This is far
from over, avengers.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.768
I will find a way
to make you all pay!

17:51.637 --> 17:53.404
(trolls growl)

17:54.506 --> 17:56.007
Trolls? Again?

17:56.576 --> 17:59.677
Loki: This is a battle
for another day.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.911
Quickly, through the portal!

18:06.018 --> 18:07.752
Come with me, brother!

18:11.623 --> 18:14.625
Is there any trick
you won't fall for?

18:16.295 --> 18:18.296
(electricity crackles)

18:22.534 --> 18:24.735
I'm sorry for your
lands, doctor.

18:25.671 --> 18:28.539
Stark industries will
contribute to the
rebuilding effort.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.375
Now, if you'll come
with us, we, uh...

18:31.711 --> 18:36.514
Latveria does not require
your charity, stark.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.584
And your authority to
detain me amounts to
precisely nothing.

18:42.421 --> 18:47.491
Every incident has
occurred, entirely within
my sovereign borders.

18:47.859 --> 18:49.860
What? Tell me
he's not right.

18:52.030 --> 18:58.669
Now, I suggest you
leave, before I detain
you for violating my laws.

18:59.638 --> 19:05.376
Besides, I expect you'll
have more pressing
matters to attend.

19:05.610 --> 19:06.877
What's that supposed
to mean?

19:07.646 --> 19:10.915
Loki, you have proven
yourself a hero this day.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.884
(grunts)
why not remain one?

19:14.386 --> 19:16.921
Your friends were right,
you should not trust me.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.523
You may have defeated
your destiny today,

19:19.525 --> 19:21.525
But our struggle
is far from over.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.693
(yells)

19:22.695 --> 19:25.629
It will only end
with one of us dead!

19:26.431 --> 19:28.766
(grunts) we are brothers.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.869
And I will fight
to my last breath
to save you.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.638
Even if it is from yourself.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.843
(laughs) save me?
Save me!

19:39.478 --> 19:43.647
I stand upon the helhorn.
The power of the destroyer
is mine.

19:44.082 --> 19:47.017
You are the one
who is in the need of saving.

19:51.656 --> 19:53.057
I know those horns.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.593
Everyone says
I'm the dumb one.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.661
You can't trust loki.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.697
Not as far as you
can throw him.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.665
Think you can reach it?

20:02.634 --> 20:03.768
Watch me.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.670
(strains)

20:09.441 --> 20:10.641
(growls)

20:11.643 --> 20:12.910
(pants)

20:13.979 --> 20:15.946
(explosion)

20:17.182 --> 20:18.516
(roars)

20:18.518 --> 20:19.884
(yells)

20:26.658 --> 20:27.958
(yells)

20:30.862 --> 20:32.129
(computer whirs)

20:37.536 --> 20:39.904
Hmm, took more out
of me than I thought.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.705
Hulk, a little help here!

20:48.647 --> 20:49.713
High five.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.651
Loki's about to get
a big wake up call.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.719
Loki: Where, where's midgard?

20:55.721 --> 20:58.789
No! Thor!

21:02.060 --> 21:03.761
(groans)

21:05.030 --> 21:06.597
(grunts)

21:11.603 --> 21:12.970
(trolls cheer)

21:17.542 --> 21:20.611
I will make
you pay dearly.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.681
I am sure you
will and it will be
a glorious battle.

21:23.683 --> 21:27.818
But for now, you have
angry trolls to deal with.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.086
Trolls?

21:29.221 --> 21:30.621
Goodbye, brother.
