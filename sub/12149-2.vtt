00:20.530 --> 00:22.489
Maybe we should go
over this thing again...

00:22.929 --> 00:25.839
...of you getting out
and involving yourself with people.

00:26.530 --> 00:29.160
It's Friday night,
the most social night of the week.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.250
A couple of lookers like us should be
out there enjoying the night life.

00:34.329 --> 00:36.079
You're sitting here moping
in the dark like--

00:36.130 --> 00:37.109
A vampire?

00:37.929 --> 00:41.829
Well, yeah. I was gonna say slacker,
but, yeah, to you, Mr. Obvious.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.670
- You gotta come out, man.
- Why?

00:44.530 --> 00:46.630
Because I think we deserve
a night of fun.

00:46.929 --> 00:49.210
It breaks up those nights
of death and mayhem.

00:49.929 --> 00:52.320
Plus, we could toast to new business.

00:53.530 --> 00:54.689
The three of us.

00:55.929 --> 00:58.979
Doyle, if you want to ask Cordelia
out, just do it yourself.

00:59.530 --> 01:01.420
I don't even know if she likes me.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.670
Put in a good word for me.
Tell her what a great guy I am.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.019
- I barely know you.
- Perfect, that should make it easier.

01:08.530 --> 01:09.719
Hello?

01:10.329 --> 01:13.739
When you're talking me up to her,
whatever you do...

01:13.930 --> 01:15.930
...don't let her in on me
being half demon.

01:16.930 --> 01:18.650
Women get a little funny about that.

01:18.730 --> 01:19.780
They're finally in!

01:20.530 --> 01:21.969
They're in.

01:24.129 --> 01:24.730
Okay.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.239
- Your cards.
- The cards.

01:27.730 --> 01:30.469
Your cards to leave with people
so they can reach you.

01:31.329 --> 01:35.790
Great idea. You don't have a signal
folks can shine when they need help.

01:37.329 --> 01:39.150
Look at that. There's our number.

01:39.730 --> 01:41.689
It's right next to...

01:43.930 --> 01:45.090
...a butterfly?

01:46.329 --> 01:48.819
It's obviously not a butterfly,
you idiot.

01:49.930 --> 01:51.010
It's a bird.

01:51.730 --> 01:52.640
No, it's an owl.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.680
A bird that hunts at night.
Brilliant.

01:54.730 --> 01:55.599
It's an angel.

01:56.530 --> 01:58.459
An angel. Right. It's an angel.

01:58.930 --> 02:01.030
So obvious, and yet so clever
on so many levels.

02:01.930 --> 02:03.299
- Shut up.
- Jesus.

02:03.730 --> 02:05.799
Don't be a baby. I barely hit you.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.300
Doyle?

02:18.729 --> 02:20.240
- You okay, man?
- I'm okay.

02:21.129 --> 02:23.479
Sit up. What'd you see?
What'd you see?

02:24.129 --> 02:26.620
It's a bar.
I think I recognize it.

02:27.129 --> 02:29.520
One of those terminally stuck
in the '80s places.

02:30.129 --> 02:31.500
Yeah, and...?

02:32.530 --> 02:34.879
No faces popped out at me, man.

02:36.729 --> 02:37.669
Just a feeling.

02:37.930 --> 02:38.840
What feeling?

02:39.729 --> 02:40.919
Something's gonna happen.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.469
Looks like you got your wish.
We're going out.

03:11.530 --> 03:12.789
Excuse me.

03:13.930 --> 03:15.090
- May I?
- What?

03:17.530 --> 03:19.039
Oh. Sure.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.490
Please.

03:22.930 --> 03:23.870
Kevin.

03:24.729 --> 03:25.599
Sharon.

03:34.330 --> 03:35.699
God, I really hate places like this.

03:37.930 --> 03:39.090
Don't you?

04:38.689 --> 04:41.319
When I was a kid I thought,
"You grow up, you meet her...

04:41.689 --> 04:43.199
...and everything falls in place."

04:44.089 --> 04:45.810
Yeah, I had that.

04:45.889 --> 04:47.750
Only I had a him where you had a her.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.389
Really I just had a Ken and a Barbie.

04:55.490 --> 04:56.689
Ken and Barbie had it easy.

04:56.689 --> 04:59.079
They didn't have to come
to places like this.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.730
But you gotta try.

05:02.089 --> 05:06.230
I mean, what if she was here
and you missed her...

05:06.889 --> 05:09.279
...because you were too,
I don't know...

05:10.490 --> 05:12.279
...burned out to still believe.

05:14.089 --> 05:15.319
You know what I mean?

05:15.889 --> 05:16.870
I know exactly what you mean.

05:17.089 --> 05:20.069
You have to believe that someday
you'll meet someone special.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.000
I think I have.

05:25.490 --> 05:29.420
Oh, God, I can't believe I just said
that. You are, but it sounded so--

05:30.290 --> 05:32.750
No, it sounded nice, Kevin.

05:44.089 --> 05:46.790
Ooh, classy.

05:47.689 --> 05:49.899
Okay, now what?

05:51.290 --> 05:53.750
Split up. Look for someone
who might be in trouble.

05:54.290 --> 05:56.220
Or something that's about to cause it.

06:03.889 --> 06:05.290
What can I get you?

06:08.089 --> 06:11.670
Just wondering, you noticed
anything unusual here tonight?

06:12.290 --> 06:13.089
Unusual?

06:13.490 --> 06:17.990
You know, out of the ordinary.
Possibly even dangerous?

06:18.889 --> 06:22.750
It's early yet. The real hot women
don't mosey in till around 11.

06:25.490 --> 06:27.949
Hi. If you're in trouble,
just call this number.

06:28.490 --> 06:29.930
We can help.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.709
Hi. Being harassed by someone
or something?

06:33.290 --> 06:34.660
Dial us up, day or night.

06:35.089 --> 06:38.180
Hey, you look troubled.
Or is that just your lazy eye?

06:38.689 --> 06:41.149
Call us. We're very discreet.

06:42.290 --> 06:43.689
Hi. How are you?

06:44.089 --> 06:46.720
Hey. This isn't a marketing
seminar, princess.

06:47.089 --> 06:49.050
We need to operate more below radar.

06:50.689 --> 06:51.769
What radar?

06:51.889 --> 06:52.730
The police.

06:53.089 --> 06:56.420
The service our friend Angel provides
might make them think of the "V" word.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.689
- Vampire?
- No, vigilante.

06:59.689 --> 07:01.550
There's laws against
that sort of thing.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.439
You need to be a little bit
more casual-like.

07:05.089 --> 07:06.949
"Hi, what's your name?"
"How's life?"

07:07.490 --> 07:09.379
"Minions from hell getting you down?"

07:09.889 --> 07:11.850
Excuse me, but I am an actress.

07:12.290 --> 07:15.730
A student of the human animal.
I don't need talk to know their story.

07:17.689 --> 07:19.089
Jazz hands over there?

07:19.490 --> 07:21.629
Mama's boy. Peter Pan complex.

07:22.490 --> 07:26.740
Self-absorbed with a big "the world
owes me" chip on her shoulder.

07:27.889 --> 07:30.519
Check out "Sarah, Plain and Tall."

07:32.689 --> 07:34.720
Has or comes from big money.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.529
How do you know?

07:36.889 --> 07:39.660
You gotta be rich to snag the guy
she's leaving with.

07:40.490 --> 07:44.040
All riveting insights, but we need
to find someone that's in trouble.

07:44.689 --> 07:46.019
How's Angel doing?

07:47.089 --> 07:48.949
Seriously, I wasn't hitting on you.

07:53.689 --> 07:54.879
Are you okay?

07:55.490 --> 07:57.209
- What?
- Oh, nothing. Sorry.

08:00.889 --> 08:02.220
Am I okay?

08:02.689 --> 08:04.410
Well, you just looked bad.

08:05.089 --> 08:07.089
You don't look bad,
you look very nice.

08:08.089 --> 08:09.389
I'm just gonna have my drink.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.680
Thanks.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.180
For thinking you look bad or good?

08:17.089 --> 08:18.029
You choose.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.620
I'm Angel.

08:20.689 --> 08:22.129
I'm Kate.

08:24.889 --> 08:25.939
Do you come here a lot?

08:26.689 --> 08:28.410
No, it's the first time. It's--

08:29.089 --> 08:30.279
Easy? Yeah.

08:33.289 --> 08:36.379
I prefer those cool bars that are hard
to get into, but I can't get in.

08:36.889 --> 08:38.570
Anyway, this is close to home.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.409
So did you just stop in?

08:44.090 --> 08:46.230
- I'm looking for something.
- I'm keeping you--

08:46.490 --> 08:50.179
No, no. I'm just looking
for someone to rescue.

08:51.889 --> 08:53.360
Are you in need of some rescuing?

08:54.289 --> 08:55.870
That's the strangest line
I'll hear tonight.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.279
No, no, it's not a line, I'm--

08:57.889 --> 09:00.350
Oh, I didn't mean--
That was harsh.

09:00.889 --> 09:03.730
You know, I'm not very good
at this talking.

09:04.490 --> 09:06.070
I'm the expert, I'm sure you see.

09:07.490 --> 09:09.100
But no, I don't need rescuing.

09:11.690 --> 09:14.009
I gave up on "knight in shining armor"
a while ago.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.450
I don't expect to find him
at the International House of Posers.

09:21.289 --> 09:22.549
People can surprise you.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.230
I sound like a big hypocrite, don't I?

09:26.690 --> 09:29.289
Ragging on this place?
I come here every night.

09:30.889 --> 09:33.769
How else you gonna meet somebody
outside of work? It's this...

09:34.490 --> 09:36.029
...or sit home alone in the dark.

09:37.490 --> 09:39.029
Wouldn't want that.

09:39.889 --> 09:42.169
So, what do you do?

09:44.090 --> 09:45.139
- Do?
- For a living.

09:47.090 --> 09:49.929
Well, basically, I'm.... I help--
I'm a veterinarian.

09:51.289 --> 09:52.340
Really?

09:54.889 --> 09:57.450
I always say a man that loves
animals is a man you can trust.

10:01.490 --> 10:02.889
You got everyone figured out?

10:03.289 --> 10:05.889
Not everyone.
I mean, you I don't get.

10:06.889 --> 10:07.730
Me?

10:08.090 --> 10:10.049
What's with those visions of yours?

10:10.490 --> 10:14.559
They're messages I get from
the higher powers, whoever they are.

10:15.289 --> 10:18.309
- It's my gift.
- If that was my gift, I'd return it.

10:18.889 --> 10:23.070
You get those headaches and then
you do this thing with your face.

10:24.289 --> 10:27.269
- What thing with my face?
- Plus, your visions are lame.

10:27.889 --> 10:29.750
A bar? That's nice and vague.

10:30.289 --> 10:33.870
They should send you one of those
self-destructing tapes with a dossier.

10:34.490 --> 10:36.519
- I'll be sure to mention it.
- Hey!

10:37.490 --> 10:39.279
You the one handing out these cards?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.149
Do you need help?

10:41.690 --> 10:44.360
Do you mind if I
ring you up some time for a date?

10:44.690 --> 10:47.110
- Yeah, she minds.
- I can handle this.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.409
Yes, I mind. This is a business card.

10:50.090 --> 10:51.950
Our services are for people in need.

10:52.490 --> 10:53.960
I might need a little service.

10:54.889 --> 10:55.830
You charge by the hour?

10:56.090 --> 10:57.070
Excuse me?!

10:57.289 --> 10:59.960
Just relax here a little bit.
The lady's with me.

11:00.889 --> 11:03.350
- No, I'm not!
- Nobody's talking to you, wipe.

11:04.490 --> 11:05.889
Well, I guess I just....

11:06.889 --> 11:10.580
I just have a hard time, you know,
trusting people.

11:11.690 --> 11:13.549
Male people, particularly.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.279
In a place like this, nobody will
show you who they really are.

11:19.490 --> 11:23.700
Everybody's too busy trying to get
whatever it is they're looking for.

11:25.490 --> 11:28.299
- What are you looking for?
- Depends how many daiquiris I've had.

11:29.090 --> 11:31.509
Oh, God, way to come off
like a drunken slut.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.830
Slut's better than a hypocrite, right?
I'm moving up?

11:36.289 --> 11:37.970
You're kind of hard on yourself.

11:38.090 --> 11:41.320
I'm a self-flagellating hypocrite slut.
What was your question?

11:42.289 --> 11:43.340
What are you looking for?

11:46.490 --> 11:48.419
I'm just trying to make a connection.

11:51.289 --> 11:54.029
The more I come to places like this,
the harder it gets.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.210
What are you looking for in here?

11:57.289 --> 11:59.149
I honestly don't know.

11:59.690 --> 12:01.230
I'll know it when I see it.

12:03.289 --> 12:04.799
Would you?

12:06.289 --> 12:08.320
- I'm sorry, forget it.
- What?

12:09.889 --> 12:12.799
I was gonna ask if you wanted
to go someplace...

12:13.490 --> 12:14.889
...more quiet.

12:17.090 --> 12:18.389
I can't.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.250
I have to stay here.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.139
Right.

12:26.090 --> 12:28.120
- I would....
- No, that's okay.

12:35.409 --> 12:37.549
Listen, I don't want
any trouble, okay?

12:37.809 --> 12:39.139
- What's the trouble?
- No trouble.

12:39.610 --> 12:41.259
I said we didn't want any trouble.

12:42.009 --> 12:43.309
We are trouble-free.

12:43.809 --> 12:46.299
She's a hooker and her pimp
is giving me a hard time.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.529
- That's it!
- Down, Cord.

12:49.210 --> 12:50.259
Did you hear that?

12:50.409 --> 12:53.500
Simmer down here. Violence is not
gonna solve a thing, all right?

12:55.210 --> 12:56.889
Though it's kind of festive.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.769
Oh, my gosh.

13:02.409 --> 13:03.570
Oh, my God.

13:25.210 --> 13:26.580
Those jerks started it.

13:27.009 --> 13:29.360
Hey, not a word.
Every time with you guys.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.110
Out. Come on, let's go.

13:34.809 --> 13:38.070
- Wow. Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thanks.

13:44.409 --> 13:45.919
I'm okay.

13:48.009 --> 13:49.240
Are you okay?

13:49.809 --> 13:52.970
Well, now, that's for you to find out.

13:54.610 --> 13:57.000
I'd really like to know.

13:57.610 --> 14:00.629
So, how do you want to do this?

14:01.809 --> 14:03.070
Twenty questions?

14:09.009 --> 14:12.269
Marcie from Barstow.
That doesn't even rhyme or anything.

14:14.409 --> 14:17.110
It's wild,
us meeting over a bar fight.

14:18.009 --> 14:20.679
Isn't it great when two people
make a connection?

14:25.289 --> 14:26.519
It's late.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.250
Yeah.

14:31.289 --> 14:32.830
- I should--
- I know.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.070
Well....

14:37.889 --> 14:41.610
Well, I mean,
if you have to leave, I understand.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.769
But I'd just like to hold you.

14:55.889 --> 14:58.769
I'm having a hard time believing
the vision meant I was to come here...

14:59.490 --> 15:01.659
- ...and break up a bar fight.
- If it was...

15:02.490 --> 15:04.740
...I'm in for some serious
workman's comp.

15:04.889 --> 15:06.919
Did you sense anybody here
needed help?

15:07.889 --> 15:09.259
Yeah, everybody.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.620
This socializing thing is brutal.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.090
I was young once. I went to bars.

15:14.490 --> 15:16.950
- It was never like this.
- I used to go to taverns, man.

15:17.490 --> 15:19.840
Small towns.
Everybody used to know each other.

15:20.490 --> 15:22.419
Like high school. It's easy to date.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.190
We all had so much in common.
Being monster food, for instance.

15:27.090 --> 15:28.809
You're in the big bad city now.

15:28.889 --> 15:30.009
Where everyone's a stranger.

15:31.289 --> 15:33.500
Hiding behind walls. Keeping secrets.

15:33.690 --> 15:35.340
Sorry. Gotta kick you out now.

15:36.090 --> 15:37.100
Sure.

15:37.289 --> 15:39.149
The single life's really hard for you.

15:40.889 --> 15:41.759
Why?

15:42.090 --> 15:44.620
Before, you only had to worry
about a hangover.

15:45.090 --> 15:48.210
Now because of your curse thingy,
you can't sleep with anyone...

15:48.690 --> 15:51.110
...or you might feel true happiness
and lose your soul...

15:51.690 --> 15:53.649
...become evil again
and kill everyone.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.970
I always appreciate your perspective.

15:58.289 --> 16:01.309
No problem. The last thing I want
is to show up at the office...

16:01.889 --> 16:04.629
...and find that I'm working
for a homicidal monster.

16:45.769 --> 16:48.299
This is whacked.
I don't know what I'm looking for.

16:48.769 --> 16:51.509
You're looking for anything
in and around that bar.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.720
I'm in the newsgroup search engine.
What's the name?

16:55.370 --> 16:57.399
D'Oblique. Capital D, apostrophe--

16:57.769 --> 17:00.679
Not so fast. Okay, capital D.

17:01.370 --> 17:03.399
Apostrophe, apostrophe, apostrophe....

17:04.368 --> 17:06.789
Oh, I got it. Okay, now what's
after that again?

17:07.368 --> 17:08.309
I need a break.

17:10.368 --> 17:12.118
Let me get in here.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.490
How'd you get computer skills?

17:17.569 --> 17:18.829
Downloading pictures of naked women?

17:19.368 --> 17:21.089
That's more or less accurate.

17:22.368 --> 17:24.400
Hello. We got two hits.

17:26.569 --> 17:27.269
Look:

17:27.769 --> 17:29.069
"Search continues for Heather Nolan.

17:29.569 --> 17:32.450
Missing since late last month,
the 24-year-old paralegal...

17:33.170 --> 17:35.059
...vanished after leaving D'Oblique."

17:35.569 --> 17:37.220
Missing girl. That's up your alley.

17:37.369 --> 17:38.529
What's the second one say?

17:39.769 --> 17:42.930
"A badly mutilated body found
nearly three weeks ago...

17:43.970 --> 17:46.640
...described by the coroner's office
as eviscerated...

17:46.970 --> 17:50.299
...has been identified as 28-year-old
Martin Haber.

17:51.170 --> 17:55.140
Last seen with an unidentified female
at D'Oblique, a singles bar."

17:55.970 --> 17:59.269
Probably been more disappearances
not traced back to the bar yet.

18:00.170 --> 18:01.750
We got a missing girl and a stiff.

18:01.970 --> 18:04.109
An eviscerated stiff.
Use the library.

18:04.970 --> 18:09.109
Narrow down a list of eviscerating
demons who'd prey on young singles.

18:09.769 --> 18:11.099
- Where are you going?
- The bar.

18:11.569 --> 18:13.109
See if I can meet a killer.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.359
Excuse me.

18:20.569 --> 18:22.960
- Well, hello.
- Hi. Kate.

18:25.970 --> 18:28.319
- I'm glad to see you again.
- Really?

18:30.170 --> 18:32.339
I owe you an apology for last night.

18:33.170 --> 18:34.609
You don't owe me anything.

18:34.970 --> 18:36.339
It was rude.

18:37.970 --> 18:39.410
Okay, then...

18:40.369 --> 18:43.490
...maybe you can buy me a drink
and we can start fresh.

18:45.769 --> 18:47.240
You shouldn't go in there tonight.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.369
What do you mean?

18:49.369 --> 18:50.380
I'm not sure it's safe.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.039
What's not safe?

18:52.970 --> 18:54.230
I can't really explain it.

18:54.769 --> 18:58.029
I have a problem trusting people,
and you're not making it any better.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.000
- I'm asking you not to go.
- Where are you going?

19:03.769 --> 19:04.640
In there.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.650
Well, I'll tell you what.

19:07.369 --> 19:10.460
I can go wherever I want,
and you can go to hell.

19:16.369 --> 19:18.049
Been there, done that.

19:24.769 --> 19:26.490
- The usual?
- Thanks.

19:46.970 --> 19:49.180
You know, some guys have got
real problems.

19:52.369 --> 19:53.769
I'm sorry, you were saying?

19:54.170 --> 19:58.490
Oh, nothing. It's just my job.
You know, it's hard...

19:58.970 --> 19:59.839
...to meet people.

20:00.769 --> 20:04.740
I mean, everybody is watching
their own back. It's tough...

20:05.569 --> 20:06.650
...knowing who you can trust.

20:07.369 --> 20:10.390
Still, I'm surprised. I'd think
you could have your pick of girls.

20:11.569 --> 20:12.549
Yeah?

20:16.369 --> 20:19.420
I don't know. I was pretty much
a spaz in high school.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.779
I mean a real
"something's out there" geek...

20:23.569 --> 20:25.890
...with a gang of geektoid minions.

20:26.569 --> 20:28.430
I couldn't get a date to save my life.

20:30.769 --> 20:32.170
It's good high school's over.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.440
Yeah.

20:44.569 --> 20:45.549
Where's Kevin?

20:46.369 --> 20:48.650
Hell if I know. I haven't seen him.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.650
Dude didn't come to work today,
and he's not answering his phone.

20:52.369 --> 20:54.470
Pretty sure he hooked up last night.

20:55.369 --> 20:58.210
- Probably sleeping it off.
- What girl?

21:04.009 --> 21:06.400
You know what, here's another one:
"Piasca."

21:07.009 --> 21:09.359
It's a flesh-eating Indian demon...

21:09.410 --> 21:12.710
...that enters victims through
the mouth and eviscerates from within.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.240
- You gonna put that one down?
- Yep.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.930
Demons. Is there anything
more disgusting?

21:21.410 --> 21:22.599
You think so?

21:23.809 --> 21:25.009
Come on.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.200
Look at this one.

21:26.809 --> 21:29.970
This demon wears a wreath
of intestines around its head.

21:31.009 --> 21:32.380
What kind of statement is that?

21:32.809 --> 21:35.829
It really depends, doesn't it?

21:36.410 --> 21:39.710
Demons could be actually nice,
given the opportunity.

21:40.009 --> 21:42.500
You'd have to get to know them.

21:43.609 --> 21:45.710
I've known a lot of demons,
and, slime aside...

21:46.009 --> 21:47.059
...not a lot there.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.269
Sharon. Her name is Sharon.

21:53.809 --> 21:56.690
- Counter regular.
- Sharon. That dowdy chick.

21:56.809 --> 21:58.910
Kevin. Scraping the bottom
of the barrel.

22:00.410 --> 22:03.250
- Look, where can I find Sharon?
- She's here tonight.

22:04.009 --> 22:06.920
No Kevin, though.
Guess it wasn't true love after all.

22:08.809 --> 22:11.089
She was just there
with some screech.

22:11.809 --> 22:13.000
That's more her level.

22:13.609 --> 22:15.430
- Any idea where she lives?
- No.

22:16.009 --> 22:18.109
- What about a last name?
- Last name?

22:18.410 --> 22:20.509
Not a lot of last names
in a place like this.

22:21.410 --> 22:22.670
It's Reichler.

22:25.009 --> 22:26.339
I asked her out a couple times.

22:44.809 --> 22:46.140
I'm sorry.

22:47.809 --> 22:49.599
I wanted this to go better.

22:52.609 --> 22:54.359
Maybe I was trying too hard.

22:55.609 --> 22:58.170
I just really like you.

22:59.809 --> 23:01.670
Next time it'll be better.

23:05.809 --> 23:07.140
Roll over.

23:08.809 --> 23:09.970
Okay.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.740
This is nice.

23:26.369 --> 23:27.769
I think sometimes--

24:08.970 --> 24:09.809
You're not human.

24:10.170 --> 24:13.150
News flash, pal. You're a bit off
the evolutionary chart, yourself.

24:16.769 --> 24:19.089
This has to stop
You have to stop.

24:19.769 --> 24:23.460
I will when I find the right one.
The one I can stay with.

24:25.769 --> 24:27.980
The right body?
What's wrong with this one?

24:28.769 --> 24:31.160
Nothing. Yet.

24:31.769 --> 24:35.809
It's new and different. It's great.

24:38.970 --> 24:40.339
But it won't last.

24:41.369 --> 24:43.160
I already know it's not the one.

24:43.170 --> 24:44.539
It'll be the one you die in.

25:32.369 --> 25:33.700
What are you doing here?

25:37.769 --> 25:39.420
I know what this looks like.

25:41.970 --> 25:43.230
So do I.

25:48.490 --> 25:50.140
- You have the right--
- I waive it.

25:52.089 --> 25:54.019
- How'd you find me?
- I've been tracking you.

25:54.490 --> 25:56.140
Don't move. Not a step.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.779
- Backup is on the way.
- We're on the same side.

25:59.289 --> 26:01.289
- I'm after him too.
- You're an investigator?

26:01.690 --> 26:02.460
More or less.

26:02.890 --> 26:04.119
Where's your license?

26:04.690 --> 26:06.059
- That's the less part.
- Right.

26:07.690 --> 26:08.809
You didn't see--

26:08.890 --> 26:11.589
What I see is the carving job
of an impotent sicko.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.710
It's frustrating, isn't it?
Not being able to connect?

26:17.289 --> 26:20.099
To love like other people?
How do you get them to trust you?

26:20.890 --> 26:23.730
Give them the "I'm not good
with talking" speech?

26:24.490 --> 26:25.859
He gives them
what they're longing for.

26:26.289 --> 26:27.200
- And that is?
- Hope.

26:28.089 --> 26:30.019
That their loneliness might end.
He'll keep doing it.

26:30.490 --> 26:32.660
Unless I let you go
so you can stop him.

26:32.890 --> 26:34.470
Save me the lines.
I've heard them.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.990
I've heard yours.
Not being able to trust people?

26:38.289 --> 26:39.450
Turn around.

26:43.089 --> 26:44.740
- I'm sorry.
- Is that a confession?

26:45.490 --> 26:46.890
I didn't do that.
I'm sorry for this.

27:11.730 --> 27:14.150
Wow, this place is....

27:14.730 --> 27:16.660
I thought girls liked pretty things.

27:17.130 --> 27:19.519
Don't start.
Angel told us to meet here...

27:19.529 --> 27:21.390
...so we are. That doesn't mean--

27:22.529 --> 27:26.220
That is so high school. "Cordelia
wears bras. She has girl parts."

27:27.329 --> 27:29.329
Take it easy. You're defensive.

27:29.730 --> 27:32.150
It's refreshing to see a woman
living like this.

27:32.730 --> 27:35.259
You're not so uptight.
You live for the moment.

27:38.130 --> 27:39.460
You're disgusting.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.359
- Who is it?
- It's me.

27:48.930 --> 27:50.750
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.319
Look, I can't--

27:54.329 --> 27:55.940
Invite him in. If you're alive...

27:56.730 --> 27:58.799
...vampires can't cross the threshold.

27:59.130 --> 28:00.920
- Promise you'll stay good?
- Cordelia.

28:01.529 --> 28:03.069
I'm kidding. Come in.

28:06.329 --> 28:07.839
What the hell happened to you?

28:08.130 --> 28:11.609
That woman that I was talking to
at the bar last night, Kate.

28:12.329 --> 28:13.940
- She's the killer?
- She's a cop.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.980
- Followed me to another body.
- She thinks you did it.

28:18.329 --> 28:19.940
So we don't have a lot of time--

28:23.730 --> 28:26.150
- You actually live here?
- Yes, okay?

28:26.730 --> 28:28.690
Is it my fault maid
service was interrupted?

28:29.130 --> 28:33.380
It was supposed to go, home, hotel,
hotel, husband. Now can we move on?

28:34.529 --> 28:37.549
We put together that list of
eviscerating demons you asked for.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.059
- We narrowed--
- I saw it. It's a burrower.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.019
It's a donkey?

28:43.529 --> 28:44.730
We didn't see any donkey demons.

28:44.730 --> 28:46.309
- Burrower.
- Oh.

28:47.130 --> 28:50.319
It eviscerates its victims
as it goes from body to body...

28:50.730 --> 28:53.960
...and maybe only after some kind of
a sex act, exchange of fluids thing.

28:54.930 --> 28:55.769
Lovely.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.039
Find out anything you can about
this thing, weaknesses.

28:59.730 --> 29:01.980
It was amazingly strong.

29:02.130 --> 29:03.140
It may be hard to kill.

29:03.930 --> 29:06.000
- Hey, we're on it.
- Good.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.839
I'm going back to the bar.

29:08.130 --> 29:10.299
But it knows you're after it.

29:11.730 --> 29:14.960
It'll be out there. It's gotta keep
trying to make the connection.

29:15.930 --> 29:17.089
Why?

29:18.329 --> 29:20.220
Because that's what lonely people do.

31:18.130 --> 31:19.710
- Morning.
- Hey.

31:22.329 --> 31:24.079
- Any luck, yet?
- No, not yet.

31:25.329 --> 31:27.890
I know I'd recognize it
if I saw it in another body.

31:28.329 --> 31:31.950
That narrows it down to about, what,
five million suspects in the city?

31:34.329 --> 31:35.339
Did you find anything?

31:37.329 --> 31:41.650
Yeah, we found a name for
this burrower guy. Talamour?

31:42.130 --> 31:44.519
He's been around forever.
A dawn-of-time kind of dude.

31:45.130 --> 31:46.950
- Any weaknesses?
- Few and far between.

31:47.529 --> 31:49.109
This kid is strong, like you said.

31:49.329 --> 31:51.539
He's not too crazy about fire, though.

31:52.329 --> 31:53.559
Something we have in common.

31:54.130 --> 31:57.920
It's a parasite, and when it starts
to leave one body for the next...

31:58.329 --> 32:00.789
...not gonna gag here,
but the first one goes gerploohy.

32:01.329 --> 32:03.539
Curdles like cream on a hot day.

32:04.329 --> 32:06.500
I covered that with nondairy
gerploohy.

32:06.730 --> 32:08.549
I'm gonna need help
to find this thing.

32:09.730 --> 32:11.450
- Who are you calling?
- Kate.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.019
I thought we were hiding from her.

32:14.529 --> 32:16.990
She's been tracking this
thing a lot longer than we have.

32:20.410 --> 32:22.200
- Lockley.
- It's me,

32:24.009 --> 32:25.200
Help me find the killer.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.289
I'm talking to him.

32:27.009 --> 32:29.259
That would make things nice and clean,

32:29.410 --> 32:32.180
But it's not true, and I think some
part of you knows.

32:33.009 --> 32:35.710
He's still out there.
We should share information.

32:36.609 --> 32:39.099
- That's not possible.
- All I need is five minutes.

32:39.609 --> 32:42.000
If you still think I'm your man,
arrest me.

32:43.210 --> 32:44.369
Meet me at the bar at 1,

32:45.009 --> 32:48.170
That's on my to-do list:
Walk into a serial killer's trap.

32:48.609 --> 32:52.299
I don't care if you come armed, wired
and covered by sharpshooters.

32:56.410 --> 32:57.809
I can help you, Kate.

32:58.809 --> 33:00.319
You just have to trust me.

33:13.210 --> 33:15.069
The usual?

33:15.609 --> 33:17.009
That's not your usual.

33:17.410 --> 33:19.579
I'm in the mood
for something different.

33:20.410 --> 33:23.849
You know that guy, tall, nice-looking,
helped out in the bar fight?

33:24.609 --> 33:25.549
Sure. Sure.

33:25.809 --> 33:28.059
- Let me know when he's here.
- Yeah, you bet.

33:28.809 --> 33:29.819
Thanks.

33:34.809 --> 33:36.210
I hate places like this, don't you?

33:36.609 --> 33:37.549
I do, but....

33:37.809 --> 33:41.039
I guessed that. You don't look
like you're in your element here.

33:42.009 --> 33:43.130
Which is a compliment, by the way.

33:43.809 --> 33:46.339
Thanks. Look, I would love to chat,
but actually...

33:46.809 --> 33:48.210
- ...I'm waiting for someone.
- That guy.

33:48.609 --> 33:49.910
I think he's in the alley.

33:50.410 --> 33:52.829
- What is he doing?
- I took out the trash and there he was.

33:53.410 --> 33:55.619
- Looked like he was ready to rabbit.
- Show me.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.549
Sorry. You'll have to keep trolling.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.420
Call this number.
Tell the sergeant I need--

34:36.329 --> 34:37.409
Can you move?

34:38.130 --> 34:39.179
Move!

34:42.929 --> 34:44.719
I guess you're done with that body.

34:48.329 --> 34:49.909
It's tough being a guy.

34:50.730 --> 34:52.980
You don't get to finish,
you come apart at the seams.

35:12.929 --> 35:13.869
I can't let him go.

35:14.130 --> 35:16.940
He's not gonna leave.
He's gonna kill again, now.

35:17.730 --> 35:20.010
- You think so?
- He has to.

35:36.929 --> 35:38.400
Hey. How's it going?

35:38.730 --> 35:40.760
I was noticing your grace...

35:41.730 --> 35:45.380
...and wondering if you were a dancer,
because I wish I could move--

35:49.530 --> 35:52.619
Hey, excuse me, that's really
a beautiful dress you're wearing.

35:53.130 --> 35:56.010
It really brings out your skin tone.

35:59.730 --> 36:00.599
Now what?

36:02.730 --> 36:04.449
Would you like a drink or something?

36:05.130 --> 36:07.380
I'm, like, the bartender here.

36:08.730 --> 36:11.119
Just want to talk to somebody.

36:11.130 --> 36:13.760
Open up. Want to make a connection.

36:20.730 --> 36:22.099
We're going out that window.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.250
It's almost 20 feet up.

36:26.730 --> 36:27.849
Who are you?

37:01.530 --> 37:04.159
Please, I just want to hold you.

37:29.130 --> 37:30.000
Run!

38:42.929 --> 38:44.539
It all seems to add up.

38:45.329 --> 38:46.630
He was connected to everyone.

38:50.130 --> 38:52.619
I talked to him a dozen times.
I never had a clue.

38:53.130 --> 38:54.500
It's hard to get to know people.

38:56.130 --> 38:57.179
Yes, it is.

39:01.530 --> 39:05.110
I didn't thank you
for saving my life.

39:05.730 --> 39:07.170
Saving mine was a start.

39:11.130 --> 39:13.230
I think you should know
I searched your place.

39:14.130 --> 39:15.920
Illegally. No warrant.

39:16.530 --> 39:18.699
- Why are you telling me?
- I don't know.

39:21.329 --> 39:24.099
I guess so we can start fresh.
No secrets.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.690
That's some weird stuff
for a veterinarian.

39:30.929 --> 39:33.840
If you ever need me,
or if I can help you in any way....

39:37.530 --> 39:39.179
What is this, a lobster?

39:41.130 --> 39:42.000
I'll be around.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.949
Detective Lockley?
May I speak with you?

39:46.530 --> 39:47.789
Yes, sir.

39:52.530 --> 39:53.230
What's up?

40:04.489 --> 40:06.030
You've been working hard...

40:06.289 --> 40:08.849
...cooped up inside a lot.

40:09.889 --> 40:11.889
To show my appreciation,
I was thinking...

40:12.289 --> 40:15.869
...the night being, you know, young
and all, that the three of us...

40:19.489 --> 40:22.469
...could, well, should maybe...

40:23.690 --> 40:24.920
...go out.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.099
You know...

40:30.889 --> 40:31.760
...for fun.

40:33.289 --> 40:36.199
Or we can go home.

40:38.090 --> 40:40.050
And you could sit in the dark, alone.

40:42.889 --> 40:44.150
God, yes.

40:44.690 --> 40:45.880
Thank you.
