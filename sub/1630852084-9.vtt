- Oh, okay.
- Yes.

18:51.438 --> 18:54.308
And it exploded on him.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.076
- It exploded on him?
- Yeah.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.411
- Oh no!

18:58.846 --> 19:00.281
- What?

19:00.314 --> 19:03.284
- I think I ran over him.

19:03.317 --> 19:05.052
- What?
- You what?

19:05.085 --> 19:07.021
- I ran over him.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.956
- You did what?

19:08.989 --> 19:10.257
- I ran over him.

19:11.425 --> 19:12.827
- What are you saying?

19:13.928 --> 19:16.163
- I think I ran over him.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.799
- Are you serious, Mr. Brown?

19:18.833 --> 19:21.001
- I'm serious.
I think I ran over him.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.169
- Got to be kidding me.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.071
- I was scared.

19:24.104 --> 19:27.875
'Cause, see, he came to
me, and he said, "Uh!"

19:27.908 --> 19:31.745
When I be scared, my foot go
like that, and I buh, wrrah!

19:31.779 --> 19:33.280
And I hit it.

19:33.314 --> 19:36.150
And he said, "Uh."
- Mr. Brown.

19:36.183 --> 19:39.520
- And I felt bubu-bu-buh-bu.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.789
And he--he hit the windshield,
and he slid down.

19:41.822 --> 19:45.125
And then I heard, "Errrr."

19:45.159 --> 19:46.760
- Mr. Brown, no.
- Yeah.

19:48.529 --> 19:51.165
- You hit him?

19:51.198 --> 19:53.033
- No, no, no.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.268
I ran over him.

19:54.301 --> 19:55.469
- Mister--

19:55.503 --> 19:56.837
- There is a difference.

19:56.871 --> 19:59.106
- You ran over him
twice and backed up?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.478
- I wanted to make sure
he wasn't gonna get us.

20:04.512 --> 20:06.914
- Mr. Brown.
- I'm looking after us!

20:06.947 --> 20:09.183
It ain't about you, it ain't
about you, it's about us!

20:09.216 --> 20:10.818
We in business!

20:10.851 --> 20:13.454
That monster could have kept
us from being in business.

20:13.487 --> 20:15.222
- That is not a monster!

20:15.256 --> 20:18.159
That's my husband!

20:18.192 --> 20:19.793
- You don't seem too
concerned about him.

20:19.827 --> 20:20.895
You still right here.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.396
- Mr. Brown!

20:22.429 --> 20:23.430
- She got insurance though?

20:23.464 --> 20:25.132
- We got good insurance.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.001
- If you love him, you
would have been gone.

20:28.569 --> 20:31.405
And you still standing there.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.940
- I am in shock.

20:32.973 --> 20:35.109
- Now you thinking, "What's
love got to do with it?"

20:35.142 --> 20:36.143
I know what you thinking.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.181
- She ain't charge, she won't
touch his stank ass.

20:40.214 --> 20:41.448
- Watch your mouth!

20:41.482 --> 20:43.551
- He is a stank ass.

20:43.584 --> 20:45.085
- I'm gonna pray the Lord shut
up your tongue

20:45.119 --> 20:46.420
if you keep cussing.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.455
- He already shut up his hand.
