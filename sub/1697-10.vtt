WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.630
l'm Hannah Montana.

00:06.320 --> 00:07.550
Jake?

00:09.200 --> 00:10.430
Jake?

00:11.920 --> 00:13.190
Leslie?

00:14.320 --> 00:16.510
Just give me a second, okay?

00:17.360 --> 00:20.270
lf it helps,
you're doing better than Oliver.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.070
He fainted when l told him.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.110
Jake Ryan doesn't faint.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.750
Leslie, on the other hand,
is a little woozy.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.320
Listen...

00:31.400 --> 00:33.870
lf you're gonna be mad,
don't be mad at Miley.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.200
-She wanted to tell you, but...
-But what? Hannah wouldn't let her?

00:38.240 --> 00:41.360
Well, you know, she's a pop star.
You know how they can be.

00:41.400 --> 00:43.910
Total divas. l try to avoid them.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.790
So it's just the two of you, right?

00:46.840 --> 00:49.150
l mean, you're not also
the Dixie Chicks, are you?

00:49.200 --> 00:53.190
No. Just Miley and Hannah.
Two chicks here.

00:53.600 --> 00:57.640
Well, if that's the case,
then l think you're both pretty great.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.640
-Really?
-Really.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.720
Oh, man, paparazzi.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.470
-They follow me everywhere.
-They follow me everywhere.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.990
l think they're following me, you know,
a big movie about to open.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.110
Hello! Millions of albums already sold.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.880
-Okay, we'll just go ask them then.
-No.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.350
You're not dating Hannah.
You're dating Miley.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.990
You can't get caught cheating on me
with me.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.950
Keep up, movie star.
Ain't rocket science.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.190
<i>come on</i>!

01:36.240 --> 01:40.200
<i>You get the limo out fron</i> t

01:40.240 --> 01:43.830

02:22.600 --> 02:27.150
Helicopters, movie stars,
forbidden love?

02:27.320 --> 02:29.670
lt's all so romantic.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.070
lt would be even more romantic

02:31.120 --> 02:33.950
if you would chew
with your mouth closed.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.400
So when you told him
you were Hannah, he didn't faint?

02:38.440 --> 02:42.230
-Not once?
-Nope. Steady as a rock.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.030
All man.

02:45.080 --> 02:49.280
Well, so am l.
l just hadn't eaten that day.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.400
You know what the best part is?
Now l can finally be myself with a guy.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.150
No more secrets.
Just a normal boy-girl relationship.

03:05.960 --> 03:09.510
Why don't you all take a picture?
lt'll last longer.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.190
Hello, people, it's just an expression.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.040
Miley, relax. Just ignore them.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.670
-Why don't l get us some drinks?
-Okay.

03:20.280 --> 03:22.630
Wow, l'm kind of thirsty.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.000
Do you want water, fruit juice
or ice-tea?

03:31.800 --> 03:34.870
Are you sure you're not mad
l made us leave early?

03:34.920 --> 03:38.880
-That's okay, it gives us more time to...
-Who wants lemonade?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.990
...say hi to your dad.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.630
Yes, sir. Sweet lemonade.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.670
Refreshing and as close to puckering
as anybody's gonna get around here.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.640
Excuse me, Jake.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.950
-Daddy, can l talk to you in private?
-Sure, doll.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.390
Listen, Dad,
l don't know how to tell you this.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.110
Go away!

04:04.320 --> 04:06.830
Okay, l can take a hint.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.110
l'm gonna step out
and let you two kids have a little chat,

04:10.160 --> 04:11.910
but just remember,

04:13.520 --> 04:15.990
the heating ducts have ears.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.360
l swear, we'll never be alone.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.990
-We are now.
-No, we're not.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.310
-Right, Dad?
-Right, bud.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.550
Don't worry, Miley.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.750
Your Dad's just being
a responsible parent

04:33.800 --> 04:36.270
and l admire him for that.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.910
Won't work, boy, but nice try.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.600
lt's not my nosy, annoying Dad
l'm worried about.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.110
lt's your fans.
They wouldn't leave us alone all night.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.960
Come on,
fans are just a part of the territory.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.230
l thought Hannah Montana
would be used to that.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.710
She is, but Miley isn't.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.080
That's the reason l made up the secret,

04:58.120 --> 05:00.230
so l could go out in the world
like a normal person.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.840
And that's kind of hard to do
when you're dating me.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.280
A little bit.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.270
Does this help?

05:12.480 --> 05:13.990
A little bit.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.470
How about a little bit more?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.590
l'm not hearing any chatting.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:30.800 --> 05:35.790
Sonny, this cheese jerky is fantastic.
You have to give me the recipe.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.350
Oh, sorry, ma'am,

05:37.400 --> 05:41.310
my mom's jerky and his dad's cheese
recipe, they're top secret.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.630
But l'm a grandmother.
You can trust me.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.680
You know, we would,
but we weren't born yesterday,

05:50.720 --> 05:52.750
and neither was this baby.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.030
Rico!

06:00.040 --> 06:04.270
This isn't over!
That cheese jerky will be mine!

06:17.640 --> 06:21.550
Oh, man, it's packed.
This is gonna be a disaster.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.310
No, it's not, if Oliver orders
the chilli dog pizza again.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.390
We'll just sit by the window.

06:27.440 --> 06:31.150
Actually, l'm not hungry.
l'm all cheese jerkied up.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.080
Which brings us
right back to the window.

06:34.800 --> 06:38.550
Stop worrying about Oliver.
l'm thinking about Jake.

06:38.600 --> 06:42.190
No matter where we go, it's like a zoo.
The beach, the movies, the mall.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.040
Everybody just does this.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.510
Okay, that's creepy.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.110
Oh, and by the way, easy on the liner,
looking a little trampy.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.640
She look very nice to me.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.160
Thanks.
Appreciate it, but l have a boyfriend.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.590
Big coincidence,
because l have American girlfriend

07:01.640 --> 07:03.520
and her name is Miley.

07:04.160 --> 07:05.640
Weirdo, say what?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.550
Miley, it's me.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.110
-Jake?
-Jake?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.830
lt's Milos.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.480
You like?

07:14.520 --> 07:19.110
Look, now l'm just a regular guy.
l'm a nobody, like Oliver.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.510
Brilliant!

07:20.560 --> 07:21.910
Hey!

07:23.320 --> 07:26.950
-You did this for me?
-l did this for us.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.630
Oh, you're so sweet,

07:30.680 --> 07:33.950
but could you please be sweet
without the accent?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.830
l don't like.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.510
lf it makes you happy, sure.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.350
Just a normal guy, with normal friends,
eating normal pizza.

07:42.400 --> 07:43.990
Excuse me, people, l'm ready to order.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.390
-Hey!
-Hey, man!

07:45.440 --> 07:47.590
Hey, buddy, who do you think you are?

07:47.640 --> 07:51.840
-Well actually, l'm...
-Just a normal guy.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.950
And here in Normalville,
we take a normal number

07:54.000 --> 07:55.640
and wait our normal turn.

07:55.680 --> 08:00.190
Oh, right. No sweat.
l did this in an episode of <i>zombie High</i>.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.150
''Haunted Deli,'' take a number and wait

08:03.200 --> 08:04.630
to die.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.550
-So, what number are we?
-Thirty-two.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.070
Number six.

08:10.120 --> 08:13.110
-Are you kidding me?
-Milos!

08:13.160 --> 08:16.790
Oh, sorry. Got it. Normal people wait.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.160
l'll wait.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.390
This is endless! You know, let's go.

08:27.680 --> 08:32.390
Look like Milos has
a little bit of temper.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.150
How do people do this? lt's agony.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.230
How long have we been here?

08:44.280 --> 08:50.040
Well, in one minute
it'll be exactly a minute and a half.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.350
Thanks for letting me
cut in front of you, sweetie.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.950
My boyfriend just got his tonsils out.
He can barely talk.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.230
Honey, what's taking so long?

09:05.040 --> 09:07.550
Did l say tonsils? l meant kidney.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.070
My mom has a TASER.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.520
Okay, then, bye.

09:15.880 --> 09:20.110
-There you go, just what you ordered.
-ls it all better now?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.750
Totally.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.760
And doesn't it taste much better
knowing that you had to wait for it?

09:25.800 --> 09:27.150
Not really.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.760
You know,
this ice cream is making me thirsty.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.110
Oh, boy.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.230
l said, this ice cream is making me...

09:39.160 --> 09:42.360
Normal people get their own water.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.990
Really?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.590
Thanks, kid. See you at the movies.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.200
Mommy!

09:52.240 --> 09:54.230
-Run.
-Why?

09:54.880 --> 09:56.870
Soccer mom with a TASER.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.750
l've never felt this way before.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.390
And l know you've only been in my life
for a short time, but...

10:08.440 --> 10:10.630
Heck, l'm just gonna say this.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.510
l love you.

10:12.720 --> 10:17.000
That's right, l love you,
super-secret cheese jerky recipe.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.110
Silly, silly boy.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.640
Well, as long as l'm here...

10:38.080 --> 10:39.910
Man, that's good.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.830
What a rush.
All night and no one recognised me.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.230
And l gotta admit, l wasn't really sure
if l could do this whole normal thing.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.710
l mean, l've been famous since
l was the face of Wonder Diapers.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.110
''The only diaper endorsed
by astronauts.''

11:03.760 --> 11:05.560
Did l tell you that already?

11:05.600 --> 11:07.710
You might have mentioned it
once or twice.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.320
Or 30 times.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.870
Anyway, it was a great night.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.630
Except for this wig. l mean, it's worse
than the one l wore on <i>Teen Bigfoot</i>.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.790
''The only thing bigger than his foot...''

11:18.840 --> 11:20.870
''...was his heart!''

11:26.000 --> 11:29.790
-Still gets to me.
-lt's getting to all of us.

11:29.840 --> 11:35.040
-Where can l take this wig off?
-Upstairs, first door on the left.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.040
-Okay. Be right back.
-Can't wait.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.510
Miley, we don't exactly know
how to tell you this...

11:44.560 --> 11:47.360
-Jake's horrible.
-Yeah, that's pretty much it.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.950
l don't understand.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.750
l mean, Hannah Montana's a star, too,

11:50.800 --> 11:54.000
but underneath Hannah
is a real person.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.350
-And underneath Jake is...
-More Jake?

11:59.600 --> 12:03.270
l really liked him.
How could l not see this?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.720
Miley, none of us saw it.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.190
Come on, it's the first real time
you guys have spent together.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.110
Now that l have...

12:12.480 --> 12:14.200
So, what are you gonna do?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.150
Learn to love his flaws?

12:16.200 --> 12:20.510
Right. Like the adorable way
he steals water from little girls.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.350
-l have to break up with him, don't l?
-l think so.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.550
What if gets mad?
He could tell your secret.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.390
Guys, come on, Jake's a lot of things,
but he's not evil.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.310
l'll tell you what, next time you people
give me an itchy wig,

12:36.360 --> 12:39.160
l'll spread the word
and put you out of business.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.030
People try to mess with Jake Ryan,
Jake Ryan plays hardball.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.470
So, what'd l miss?

12:46.520 --> 12:47.950
-Nothing!
-Nothing!

12:49.520 --> 12:52.270
Oh, guys, come on.
Let's watch me on Tv.

12:59.520 --> 13:02.400
Look how cute Jake is.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.070
Why did you have to talk
and ruin everything?

13:05.520 --> 13:08.240
Okay, l've been thinking about
your problem

13:08.280 --> 13:09.870
and l got a couple of ideas that'll fix it.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.910
This isn't going to be something stupid
like, ''Move to Peru,'' is it?

13:15.240 --> 13:16.990
No!

13:19.760 --> 13:24.150
Please tell me you don't have
''face transplant'' on there, too.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.520
Well, l wasn't...

13:26.560 --> 13:28.120
Fine!

13:29.200 --> 13:31.350
And now, l have to go
to another premiere with him

13:31.400 --> 13:34.950
and act like he's not the most
obnoxious person l've ever met.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.560
l just wish l could find a way
to get him to break up with me.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.510
l know.
He'd break up with you in a second

13:39.560 --> 13:42.230
if you were half as obnoxious as he is.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.670
-Lilly, you're a genius.
-Oh, thank you.

13:47.720 --> 13:51.680
Wait, was this about the Peru
or the face transplant?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.510
-Peru.
-l knew it, l just... Sometimes.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.950
Oh, sorry, folks, we're all sold out.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.150
But don't worry, come back tomorrow,
there'll be plenty more.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.750
Yep, that's right, Rico,
l'm turning them away.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.720
And look...

14:17.800 --> 14:20.310
lt's raining money, yeah.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.000
l can't watch this any more.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.670
Wait, wait. Look, look, look.
l'm rolling in money.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.630
What are you doing?

14:37.240 --> 14:39.750
Laughing like Rico
and rolling in money?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.910
-You should try, dude. lt's fun.
-Oh, cool.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.150
Oh, but first,
my mom gave me the receipts

14:44.200 --> 14:47.270
for all the supplies she bought
and we gotta settle up.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.600
Please tell me the big one's for us.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.550
You might want to look away.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.350
Make it quick.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.670
-Jackson...
-Just go.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.230
Why, why, why?

15:20.600 --> 15:25.310
And here comes Jake Ryan
with his not-famous girlfriend, Milkey.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.230
lt's Miley.

15:27.280 --> 15:32.590
Anyway, how does it feel
to be a regular girl dating a big star?

15:32.640 --> 15:35.390
Hang on, Bri, l got a throat itch.

15:39.920 --> 15:43.880
Oh, yeah, much better.
You were saying?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.040
Wow, Jake, this one's a keeper.

15:47.080 --> 15:53.150
Oh, man, these lights are warm.
l'm just gonna air myself out.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.230
l guess we know what happened
to the ugly duckling.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.350
-Maybe we should just go inside.
-Oh, that's a good idea.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.230
But first l gotta...

16:08.160 --> 16:12.790
Oh, yeah, that feels nice.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.990
Anybody got a lawn mower?

16:16.840 --> 16:20.270
There's a breeze in Pittsburgh,
if you get my drift.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.440
-Put your arms down.
-Why?

16:24.160 --> 16:28.280
Oh, man, that's embarrassing.
l meant to braid those.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.670
Oh, my gosh, l just forgot.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.760
We forgot to feed the cat.
Let's go home.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.680
We don't have a cat, you silly goose.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.790
Maybe we can build one
with your armpits.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.230
Jake, you haven't said a word
the whole ride home.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.550
Did l do something wrong?

16:56.800 --> 16:59.870
Stop it, okay?
l know exactly what you're doing.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.590
-You do?
-Yeah, of course l do. l'm not an idiot.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.150
Okay, fine.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.349
Maybe l went about it the wrong way,
but...

17:07.400 --> 17:09.990
Little Miss Hannah Montana
can't handle it

17:10.040 --> 17:11.790
when it's all about Jake Ryan.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.030
What?

17:13.839 --> 17:16.430
Yeah, you'll do anything
to steal my spotlight.

17:16.480 --> 17:19.750
-Face it, you're jealous of me.
-Jealous of you?

17:21.160 --> 17:23.270
Why, yes, l am.

17:24.440 --> 17:29.150
l am a jealous egomaniac
and you should dump me right now.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.920
You know what?
l'll make it easier on you.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.350
Goodbye.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.390
l'm not gonna break up with you.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.430
Miley, we can get through this.

17:49.480 --> 17:53.520
You'll learn to not be jealous
just like l learnt to be a normal guy.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.510
Oh, sweet niblets.

17:55.760 --> 17:58.320
You don't know what a normal guy is.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.710
What are you talking about?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.640
Okay, maybe l'm not normal
on the outside,

18:03.680 --> 18:07.750
but inside beats the heart
of a kid just like you.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.310
That's from <i>Teen Bigfoot</i>.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.270
-So?
-So?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.350
That's exactly what l'm talking about.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.830
Normal people don't say things
that other people wrote for them.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.390
Normal people don't steal water
from little girls.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.870
Excuse me if l didn't know that.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.960
Okay, the only reason l did this
stupid normal thing was for you.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.320
You know what? l'm out of here.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.150
Being normal's not stupid.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.350
lt lets me have real friends

18:43.400 --> 18:47.360
and it reminds me
that l'm just like everybody else.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.470
And you like that?

18:50.480 --> 18:53.230
l love that, and l thought you did, too.

18:53.280 --> 18:55.190
Remember when we met?

18:55.280 --> 18:58.160
You said that sometimes
you wish you had a normal life.

18:58.200 --> 19:01.670
Where's that guy?
That's the guy l want for my boyfriend.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.390
Not this.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.830
So, how was the movie?

19:09.000 --> 19:12.070
Good night, Nurse Nickel.
What are you wearing?

19:12.720 --> 19:15.280
Daddy, not now.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.230
Ain't seen that many feathers

19:17.280 --> 19:20.950
since your Uncle Earl and Aunt Pearl
had their annual pillow fight.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.630
Well, if you didn't want
to go out with me any more,

19:25.680 --> 19:27.350
why didn't you just tell me,

19:27.400 --> 19:30.310
instead of going all woolly mammoth
at the premiere?

19:30.960 --> 19:33.550
Because l was afraid
that if l dumped you

19:33.600 --> 19:35.910
you'd get so upset and you'd...

19:35.960 --> 19:38.760
What? Tell your secret?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.760
Well, if that's the kind of guy
you think l am,

19:41.800 --> 19:44.110
then maybe l will tell your secret.

19:55.680 --> 19:59.830
Here you go, doll.
Fudge ripple's like a heartbreak airbag.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.390
Doesn't stop the hurting
but it sure cushions the blow.

20:04.760 --> 20:09.120
l don't get it.
l lie to my boyfriend and feel horrible.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.070
l tell him the truth
and it blows up in my face.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.710
Maybe l should just
give up guys for good.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.910
Oh, honey, not for good.
Just until l'm dead.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.270
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.470
lt wasn't the truth or the lies
that caused all this.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.430
lt was the boy.
He just wasn't the right one.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.550
l guess you're right.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.750
But you know what's weird?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.880
Now that Jake's gonna blow my secret,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.480
l don't know which one
l'm gonna miss more,

20:39.520 --> 20:43.990
my normal life
or the guy l thought Jake was.

20:44.560 --> 20:49.680
Well, honey, no matter what happens,
we're gonna make it through this.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.600
We always do.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.790
At least l know one big, handsome 
guy who will always love me.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.110
Who that?

20:56.160 --> 20:57.390
Oh, me.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.190
-Hello?
-Back here.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.360
-Delivery for Miley Stewart.
-Really?

21:05.920 --> 21:07.270
Thanks.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.480
Now, who would be
sending you flowers?

21:10.520 --> 21:14.150
<i>Dear Miley, l thought abou</i> t
<i>what you said and you're right</i>.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.240
<i>l do wis</i> h
<i>l was a normal person sometimes</i>.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.430
<i>l just don't know how
to do that yet</i>.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.230
<i>But when l figure it out</i>,

21:21.280 --> 21:24.480
<i>l hope l'll be worth</i> y
<i>of someone as terrific as you</i>.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.800
<i>And don't worry, your secre</i> t
<i>will always be safe with me</i>.

21:28.840 --> 21:30.640
''Love, Leslie.''

21:30.680 --> 21:32.950
Who in the Sam Heck is Leslie?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.710
A friend.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.910
A very good friend.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.470
Well, let's hope it's
 not another actor.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.030
What are you doing here?

21:52.080 --> 21:54.150
What are you talking about?
l work here.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.670
-But l fired you.
-No, you didn't.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.520
Sure l did,
and then you opened that shack.

21:59.560 --> 22:00.960
What shack?

22:06.000 --> 22:09.070
But... But it was right 
over... And you...

22:09.120 --> 22:14.480
And... And Oliver... And cheese jerky...
And l was in a baby stroller...

22:15.720 --> 22:18.550
lt's gonna be okay.
Let me take you home.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.870
But you rolled in money.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.920
Sure l did.
