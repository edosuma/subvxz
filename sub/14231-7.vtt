he won't even know the place.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.767
So, you're saying
there's some bozo out there

14:52.851 --> 14:56.604
that's as ugly as you are
who has my money!

14:56.688 --> 15:01.526
Since you know so much,
tell me where he is. Now!

15:02.694 --> 15:04.821
-[glass rattling]
-Stop!

15:04.904 --> 15:06.281
Whoa!

15:15.498 --> 15:17.459
You're this kid's father?

15:20.170 --> 15:21.796
I ain't nobody's father!

15:21.921 --> 15:27.344
You're not my dad? Ah, what a relief!
My mistake. [laughs]

15:27.427 --> 15:29.929
Sorry about the interruption.
Won't happen again.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.307
[Slick] Not so fast, shorty.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.476
It's his old man who's got your money!

15:34.559 --> 15:37.854
Get the goofy one
and you've got the dough!

15:39.647 --> 15:42.359
So, Junior, where do you live?

15:42.484 --> 15:45.028
Timbuktu!

15:45.153 --> 15:48.531
That's not the address
on your dad's car registration.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.295
Ah-hyuck! Now to get started!

16:02.837 --> 16:07.300

Ah-hyuck!

Hmm, I don't remember a mirror in there.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.653
I think I'm better-looking on this side.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.076

to cover the whole town.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.233
Just like you said!

19:52.359 --> 19:56.696
You spent my good bad money on wallpaper?

19:56.780 --> 19:59.157
I got a cash discount. Ten percent.

That's the counterfeiter!
Uh, I think.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.652
No, I'm almost positive.

All right, young fella,
which one's your real father?

20:43.785 --> 20:47.455
Will my real Dad please step forward?

21:02.429 --> 21:05.390
I sure do! [laughs]

21:05.473 --> 21:08.351
That's the counterfeiter, for sure!

21:08.476 --> 21:10.937
Curses! Goofed again!

21:18.194 --> 21:20.822
Thank you, lad,
you've done your civic duty.

You know, there's going to be a reward,
and it's all yours.

That's great! I mean, somebody's going to
have to pay for all this wallpaper!

I think he likes it. Ah-hyuck!

21:58.068 --> 22:02.364
And I think we should leave before he
wakes up to express his gratitude, Dad!
