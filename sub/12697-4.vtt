I like you hanging there

It's our favorite reality show,
"The Real Widows of Wisconsin."

watch a show like this?

tell me not to.

I don't play in the gutter.

Carly and I met.

I was working at Skybucks

RWoww takes.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.631
we talked about the show
the entire time and that--

03:16.674 --> 03:19.373
- Was the foundation
of a lifelong friendship.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.984
Harper was there for me during
the hardest time in my life.

- No.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.560
- And you know he's going
to be there.

04:16.604 --> 04:18.475
- Bo attends every
opening imaginable.

He'd attend a cesarean
if they had to step-and-repeat.

- You're joking, but he had one
at his mom's funeral.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.878
Which still seems better

04:29.921 --> 04:32.968
than running into my ex
and his new girlfriend.

anything.

Although will you be able
to see them with a blowout?

04:53.989 --> 04:55.686

a statement necklace.

I'm amazing, but just checking.

Hate my elbows.

about that?

not have a license.

Maybe Ramona likes jazz.
