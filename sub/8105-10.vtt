WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:07.924
So there I am, on my
25th birthday, driving from
Wheeling, West Virginia,

00:08.050 --> 00:11.010
to Bensonhurst,
in a Dodge Dart with no radio

00:11.136 --> 00:13.596
and a gunrunner
named Barrelhead,

00:13.722 --> 00:17.767
who insisted we sing
every Jimmy Buffett song
he could recall.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.770
What could I say?
The man was heavily armed.

00:20.896 --> 00:25.400
So, 500 renditions of Margaritaville
later... My first cover.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.945
Eight thousand words on
how Barrelhead and his friends
were transporting handguns

00:29.071 --> 00:31.030
for sale to New York City.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.242
The day the magazine
hit the stands,
the DA hit me with a subpoena.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.828
He wanted to know
Barrelhead's real name.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.956
And Greta had been
managing editor
for three whole days.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.667
So she invited me
across the street
to the fancy bar

00:42.793 --> 00:44.919
where they use real glasses.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.089
And after about
the sixth vodka and tonic,

00:48.215 --> 00:51.342
she said, "Fletch,
I want you to know
the magazine is behind you."

00:51.468 --> 00:53.136
Well, I was impressed.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.096
I said, "You think you can get
the DA off my back?"

00:55.222 --> 00:59.726
And she said, "No, but when
you get out of jail,
you'll still have a job."

01:01.812 --> 01:05.940
I'm 45. I've given up a lot.
I've given up the road,
that life...

01:06.400 --> 01:09.944
Thanks, Elizabeth. No regrets.
My lovely wife.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.864
I've given up drinking.
I've given up drugs.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.199
Greta taught me there's
two things you never give up.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.828
One's rock and roll.
The other's a source.
Greta Sims.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.748
- Great memories, Greta.
- We'll miss you, Greta.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.460
I only hope you can adjust
to the lack of stress
in your...

01:26.920 --> 01:29.881
Fletch? Fletch?

01:30.007 --> 01:31.340
Fletcher?

01:32.634 --> 01:33.885
Fletch?

01:34.178 --> 01:36.721
Fletcher?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.973
Honey? Sweetie?
Are you okay?

01:43.395 --> 01:45.021
Are you okay?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.233
I flung the investment.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.820
What did you say?

01:58.869 --> 02:00.995
I flung the investment.

02:02.790 --> 02:11.506
Why consign?

02:11.632 --> 02:12.965
I'll call 911.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.219
It's proficient.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.349
Why disqualify the rush?
I'm tabled.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.769
I'm tabled.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.108
Need your advice.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.987
What's the best
diagnostics department
within 60 miles of here?

03:16.113 --> 03:17.071
We are.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.322
Yeah. "We" aren't here.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.950
House is in Baltimore lying to Medicaid
about his billings.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.827
So? I'm board certified.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.412
You are not House.

03:24.538 --> 03:27.623
Why'd you put me in charge
if you think I can't handle it?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.918
Because it's temporary,
and because I was ordered to.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.046
What are the symptoms?

03:34.172 --> 03:35.339
Oh, come on.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.967
You're gonna diagnose him
without meeting him?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.720
Prove that you're
as brilliant as House?

03:40.971 --> 03:45.016
I need to know the symptoms to know
which hospital to recommend.

03:45.267 --> 03:49.437
EMT's report: patient struck his head
and is suffering from aphasia.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.064
A neurological problem.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.859
You know, I know a lot of
good people in that field,

03:54.985 --> 03:57.111
seeing as I happen to be
a neurologist.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.280
- You're pouting.
- Not at all.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.657
Taylor's pretty good.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.827
House was ready to hire him
till he got my resume.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.329
It's Fletcher Stone.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.498
Wrote 12 books,
exposed three administrations.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.959
- Before he exposes us...
- I get it.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.420
Famous patient needs
famous doctor.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.464
- I'll call Taylor.
- Thank you.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.966
Or maybe you should call him.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.761
What if I say
something stupid?

04:24.389 --> 04:27.016
God. House is easier.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.859
You taking any drugs?

04:36.985 --> 04:39.779
I displaced my function.
Accolade.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.031
He used to drink regularly,

04:42.157 --> 04:44.909
but he's been clean and sober
for nearly a year.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.703
Mr. Stone, you think
you're speaking normally,

04:47.829 --> 04:49.956
but your speech is impaired.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.917
He knows what he wants to say,
but when he reaches for a word,

04:53.043 --> 04:54.627
he finds something else.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.879
I grapple average.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.257
Tanzer glisten?

05:01.009 --> 05:03.344
He doesn't know
that he's saying it wrong?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.513
It all sounds right to him.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.475
I want you to write your name
and draw a face.

05:24.408 --> 05:27.743
It's called agraphia.
Loss of ability to write.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.912
Most often,
it's temporary.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.831
How hard did he
hit his head?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.749
It was
a pretty good crack.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.002
It made
a really ugly sound.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.046
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Of golf.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.299
Don't give me a sentence.
Just say "yes" or "no".

05:42.426 --> 05:44.135
Do you understand me?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.138
Yes.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.434
Elizabeth.
Fletch. Is he okay?

05:51.643 --> 05:54.395
We don't know.
This is Fletch's editor.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.105
Greta Sims.

05:56.231 --> 05:59.066
I wanted to make sure
that the EMTs told you the right story.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.609
How many stories
are there?

06:00.736 --> 06:04.113
He didn't trip. He just fell.
Out of the blue.

06:04.239 --> 06:08.826
His foot jerked a little bit, first.
That's what made it look like a trip.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.459
Don't say anything.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.169
Don't attempt to defend
your billing practices.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.087
Your billing practices
are indefensible.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.338
We've been over this.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.883
If I thought you were capable
of listening, I'd shut up.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.010
That makes
no sense at all.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.769
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.904
Every case you have
rates a five
on the complexity scale?

06:45.030 --> 06:47.907
Dr. House has
a rather specialized practice.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.076
Ah.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.996
Okay.
Then let's go through these.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.165
All of these?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.251
If you have
lunch reservations,
cancel them.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.129
All right. Patient...

07:04.382 --> 07:08.177
If he didn't trip,
something made him fall.
Stroke, seizure?

07:08.845 --> 07:11.138
Thirty people saw him trip.
One person says he didn't.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.264
Who are we
gonna believe?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.391
His symptoms can all be
explained by the head trauma.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.520
It causes
a contusion or a seizure.
That causes the aphasia.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.729
We should get an EEG.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.439
If it was a stroke,
could be a clotting issue.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.276
Even if he fell,
drug use is far more likely.
I'm ordering a tox screen.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.238
Chase. We're not done
with the differential.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.115
You're not my boss.

07:29.241 --> 07:33.160
I'm House's boss.
House is your boss.
The math is pretty simple.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.205
Are you signing my paychecks?
Are you hiring and firing?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.581
This is not about that.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.209
The only thing
you've been asked to do
is supervise House,

07:40.335 --> 07:42.128
in case
he does something insane.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.588
Which might,
you know, save a life.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.758
- Somebody's gotta be in charge.
- Why?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.219
What, do you think
we should all just do
whatever we wanna do?

07:50.345 --> 07:51.804
Maybe have a race
to the diagnosis.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.015
I think it should be
a discussion among peers.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.353
I think we're grown-up enough
to reach a consensus.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.610
Patient, 62 years old.
You prescribed Viagra.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.114
I look in vain for the words
"erectile dysfunction"

08:10.240 --> 08:12.825
in the notes
for Dolores Smith.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.536
She had a heart condition.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.329
And you
ran out of nitroglycerin?

08:17.455 --> 08:21.500
She also had
low blood pressure,
so nitro would be dangerous.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.880
The little blue pills
improve blood flow.
They're vasodilators.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.965
That's why
you sometimes get headaches.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.967
I think
Dr. House understands...

08:30.093 --> 08:32.595
Of course I do. The woman
has a heart condition,
she's on her own.

08:32.721 --> 08:36.682
A man can't nail
his office assistant,
it's national crisis time.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.769
Are you seriously expecting us
to foot the bill for
off-label use of medication?

08:40.896 --> 08:42.771
Fine. I'll pay for it.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.858
How much are the pills?
She took how many?

08:46.484 --> 08:47.776
Put the money away.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.029
- Are you trying to bribe me?
- No.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.324
I could.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.159
My client's an idiot.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.954
But is he wrong
about the pills?

08:59.331 --> 09:02.374
Off-label use
is not sanctioned...

09:02.500 --> 09:04.627
You're retiring
in three weeks.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.587
You've been doing this job
nearly 20 years.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.299
Aren't you tired
of administering policy
that you disagree with?

09:10.675 --> 09:14.094
- I never said I disagree...
- What can they do to you?

09:14.221 --> 09:17.348
And Dr. House is sorry
about his earlier outburst.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.391
Absolutely.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.275
You do background
checks on Medicaid personnel?

09:28.443 --> 09:32.154
I do what's necessary
for my client. Wow.
New personal record.

09:32.280 --> 09:34.156
Yeah.
Timing's good for me, too.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.493
Got a reservation
at a little place
in the Inner Harbor.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.036
You booked us
dinner reservations?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.914
Best Maryland crab
in Maryland.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.125
- Don't you have a plane to catch?
- Not for hours.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.294
Your flight leaves at 7:00.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.880
You did
a background check on me?

09:50.006 --> 09:53.217
And mine doesn't leave
till 9:00 p.m. It looks like
you'll be dining alone.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.721
You checked on my flight
so you could be sure
to be on a different one.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.516
I thought we were
past the avoidance stage.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.352
I didn't think
we'd be finished this soon.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.981
Where's your crucifix?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.484
I left it at the jeweler's
to be cleaned.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.195
Right.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.618
This will show us
if there's a problem
with your carotid artery

10:19.744 --> 10:21.370
that might cause a blood clot.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.830
If it went to his brain,

10:22.956 --> 10:25.874
it could explain the aphasia
and the falling down.

10:26.001 --> 10:28.502
And you're giving him an EEG.
Is that for the same thing?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.839
It's just a precaution.
I think the trauma
caused some swelling

10:31.965 --> 10:35.050
and we need to keep him stable
until the body
can repair the damage.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.177
And you think
they're both wrong?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.389
We're just covering
all the bases.
We're being safe.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.227
His O2 stats are going down.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.236
- Fluid in his lungs.
- I'll push 40 IV Lasix.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.281
We need to intubate.
He's losing
his respiratory drive.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.665
Put him down.
Put him down.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.394
And then there were two.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.023
Aphasia
and fluid in the lungs.
Seizure can't cause both.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.107
Neither can a stroke.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.026
Unless he had
an abnormal heart rhythm.

11:34.152 --> 11:38.405
And then there was one.
Urine test was positive
for amphetamines.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.491
Amphetamines don't cause
pulmonary edema.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.576
They do
if you smoke them.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.662
Well, in one of his books,
he talked about
giving up drugs and alcohol.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.414
How it changed his life.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.166
Everybody lies.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.048
When he started
wanting to hear
every minute of my day,

11:56.174 --> 11:58.926
it should have been a clue
he was the jealous type.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.970
But you know,
in that first stage
of a relationship,

12:02.097 --> 12:04.640
where it's like your body's
full of these chemicals that

12:04.766 --> 12:07.976
make you think
everything they do
is charming.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.523
Excuse me.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.358
Hello.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.569
Hey, honey. How are the kids?
Do they miss me?

12:17.862 --> 12:19.738
This may take a minute.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.158
So, what's new
with Mr. Aphasia?

12:23.284 --> 12:24.785
Cuddy called you?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.246
Everybody covers their ass.

12:27.372 --> 12:31.375
Pulmonary edema. Chase did
a tox screen. It came back
positive for amphetamines.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.668
He did the dance of victory.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.837
I'm betting
there's another shoe.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.464
I thought
the kids didn't call you.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.886
I know
the way you tell stories.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.557
Foreman went to talk to Stone
about his drug test, found him
running a temperature.

12:46.683 --> 12:50.269
So it's not the drugs.
They've just got
such a bad rep.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.983
Honey,
you shouldn't do that.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.986
Okay, I gotta hang up.
They're probably trying
to reach me.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.363
- You don't have call waiting?
- I'm hanging up on you now.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.323
It's $5 a month.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.749
Drugs don't cause fever.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.502
Encephalitis or meningitis
are the obvious suspects.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.795
Start him on antibiotics.

13:16.921 --> 13:20.132
It could be an autoimmune
disease. Lupus, Behcet's...

13:20.258 --> 13:21.800
We could start him
on a high dose of steroids.

13:21.926 --> 13:26.472
Except if he does have
encephalitis, steroids could
weaken his immune system.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.598
Foreman.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.266
How high a fever?

13:29.392 --> 13:32.853
Put me on speakerphone.
And why haven't you called me?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.397
101. How'd you know?

13:35.523 --> 13:38.734
What? You think you guys
can have a party as soon as
the parents are gone,

13:38.860 --> 13:40.360
and I won't hear about it?

13:40.487 --> 13:44.239
Start with
broad-spectrum antibiotics for
possible bacterial meningitis,

13:44.365 --> 13:47.534
and an antiviral in case
we luck out
and it's herpes encephalitis.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.994
What if it's autoimmune?

13:49.120 --> 13:52.664
Well, then we're screwed,
which is why
we need more information.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.917
Any genetic issue
with the family?

13:55.043 --> 13:57.544
The man can't talk.
His medical records
are sketchy.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.588
And the wife's only known him
a couple of years.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.716
- MRI show anything?
- The CTscan was negative.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.303
"CT." That's like
short for "MRI", right?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.722
Excellent. That's going to
save us a lot of time.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.935
We've got an MRI scheduled
in 20 minutes. Earliest
Foreman could get the machine.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.813
I teach you to lie and cheat
and steal, and as soon as
my back is turned,

14:16.940 --> 14:18.440
you wait in line?

14:18.983 --> 14:21.652
Get an MRI and get
a better medical history.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.570
The man can't talk!

14:23.696 --> 14:25.656
Who cares? He's probably
gonna lie anyway.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.492
My flight's a little late,
I'll be back in a few hours.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.622
So, you're in charge of us
because
you're in charge of him?

14:41.506 --> 14:44.091
Any family history
of neurological problems?

14:44.217 --> 14:45.217
No.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.346
Have you been
out of the country
in the last five years?

14:49.514 --> 14:50.597
Yes.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.474
Three years?

14:53.476 --> 14:54.560
Yes.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.311
Two years?

14:56.479 --> 15:00.566
He stopped traveling for work
two years ago,
after we got serious.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.150
Any vacations?

15:02.277 --> 15:04.528
His last one
was six months ago.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.531
This golf resort
at Key Biscayne.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.741
No way
it was a golf resort.

15:10.618 --> 15:14.162
Knowing Fletch, I assumed
he was working his way
through every bar in the Keyes,

15:14.289 --> 15:16.623
a last hurrah
before settling down.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.667
- Alcohol?
- No.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.627
Amphetamines?

15:20.753 --> 15:23.797
- No.
- You tested positive.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.634
He doesn't use drugs.
I told you.

15:29.637 --> 15:33.765
When we got engaged,
we decided we wanted
a different kind of life.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.687
And he dropped
the macho journalism.
No more taking crazy chances.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.981
That includes his health.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.817
He asked me
not to tell Elizabeth.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.694
So he's been lying to her
about his drug habit?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.613
Well, yes and no.

15:48.698 --> 15:52.367
BE, before Elizabeth,
he used drugs recreationally.

15:52.493 --> 15:55.996
I wasn't crazy about it,
but that thrill-seeking
behavior is what made him

15:56.122 --> 15:57.748
the kind of journalist
that he was.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.666
And now? AE?

16:00.710 --> 16:04.963
Man's twisted himself
into knots for her.
Completely cleaned up his act.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.383
- But the drugs?
- They're medicinal. Sort of.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.761
He was having trouble
sleeping.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.890
This new suburban lifestyle.
Lack of excitement
was throwing him off.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.100
So he started
with sleeping pills.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.811
When they knocked him out,
he needed something
to perk him back up

16:19.937 --> 16:21.104
during the day.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.856
Every day?

16:24.609 --> 16:26.526
No slippery slope there.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.492
Keep the stain!
Knife can't force.

16:34.285 --> 16:37.954
We're not gonna tell
your wife. We're not cops.

16:50.301 --> 16:54.721
There's a little edema,
brain swelling,
and an area of scarring.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.391
Is that
what's causing the aphasia?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.017
Actually, that's what's odd.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.812
The scarring's not
in the area of the brain
normally associated

17:01.938 --> 17:04.439
with conduction aphasia.
And it's old.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.691
Happened before
he hit his head.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.694
Maybe a small stroke
or some other
underlying condition that

17:08.820 --> 17:09.653
could be causing this.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.739
Or it might have
nothing to do with it at all.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.535
Have you ever had head trauma
before? An accident?

17:17.245 --> 17:20.664
Ever had any numbness
on one side before? Dizziness?

17:20.957 --> 17:22.624
What is the durable?

17:25.712 --> 17:26.712
No.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.137
All departing passengers
for Flight Number 870,

17:35.263 --> 17:37.305
the plane will be delayed
by one half-hour.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.766
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.924
I got you some coffee.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.068
So, what do you
want to talk about?

18:42.246 --> 18:44.664
The scarring on the MRI
could be anything.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.251
MS, toxins, any one
of 100 demyelinating diseases.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.296
If it's meningitis,
we have to ID the bug fast.

18:51.422 --> 18:52.464
We need to do
a lumbar puncture.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.634
I'm not doing an LP with this
edema. We could paralyze him.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.593
What does House say?

18:56.719 --> 18:59.638
"The person you are trying
to reach is out of the area or
has turned off their phone."

18:59.764 --> 19:01.473
So, what are your orders?

19:01.599 --> 19:04.768
- We need more information.
- There is no more information.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.978
We'll break into
his place.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.359
Have fun.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.696
- How's the patient?
- Fine.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.532
- Where are you going?
- Dinner.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.408
Oh, well, I'll join you,
and you can bring me
up to speed.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.869
Oh, sorry.
Reservation for two.

19:26.415 --> 19:30.085
When people
give themselves away,
it's by little things.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.257
That woman over there...
She's not sneering
at her coffee.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.843
She's recovering
from Bell's palsy.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.347
And the cashier
at the coffee place...

19:42.473 --> 19:45.851
She doesn't want anyone to
know, but she's dying of ALS.

19:45.977 --> 19:50.272
There's a particular
sort of twitchy, stiff arm
that's characteristic.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.441
And then there's you.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.361
Why aren't you
wearing your cross?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.572
I told you
I left it at...

19:58.698 --> 20:03.577
You keep jewelry cleaner under
the sink so you won't have
to go a day without it.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.872
True, you forgot it that
morning that our pipes burst,

20:07.832 --> 20:11.877
but then you went back
and waded through the flood
to retrieve it.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.546
So, why no wading today?

20:15.381 --> 20:18.383
Didn't you bring a book
to read, or something?

20:26.392 --> 20:27.434
Nothing.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.608
Caffeine pills
and amphetamines.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.485
Same stuff
he told us he was taking.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.613
And Topamax.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.617
An anticonvulsant?
But he said there was
no history of prior seizure.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.452
It's not even
prescribed to him.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.995
Still doesn't explain
his fever.

20:47.121 --> 20:48.413
He's probably just using it
for weight loss.

20:48.539 --> 20:53.084
Just gives us another lie.
He must really be devoted.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.461
Should we check the home?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.046
If he wanted to hide something
from his wife,

20:56.172 --> 20:57.589
why wouldn't he
hide it in the office?

20:57.715 --> 21:00.133
Or maybe
she's hiding something.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.186
Nothing but aspirin
and flu meds in the bathroom.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.608
Looks like this stuff's been
sitting here for weeks.

21:16.734 --> 21:17.734
Home improvement.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.736
He probably thought
he could take the project on,

21:19.862 --> 21:22.614
then realized it was a little
more than he could handle.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.325
You got a point to make,
or did you just feel like
giving a long,

21:25.451 --> 21:27.953
unnecessary explanation
for something
medically irrelevant?

21:28.079 --> 21:30.121
What happened to the Foreman
who always has an answer?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.332
The guy who practically
wears a sign saying,

21:32.458 --> 21:34.417
"I'm as good as House,
but I'm nicer."

21:34.543 --> 21:35.543
I never said that.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.922
I guess it's safe to be
confident when House
is there to overrule you.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.132
Now that it's all on you...

21:42.343 --> 21:44.344
It's different. Yeah.

21:48.808 --> 21:52.894
Either you left it behind
on purpose, or by mistake.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.188
The only reason you'd
leave it behind intentionally

21:55.314 --> 21:57.273
is if it no longer
meant anything to you.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.150
But since it was
a gift from your mom,

21:59.276 --> 22:00.610
that would mean
you had a fight with her.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.113
But since you don't talk
to ghosts, that's unlikely.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.447
Leave it alone, Greg.

22:04.573 --> 22:08.994
Yeah, I'm good at that.
So that leaves
forgetting it unintentionally.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.539
But then we have to explain
why you didn't go back for it
when you realized...

22:12.665 --> 22:14.374
I didn't realize
until I got to the airport.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.502
Nope. You were wearing makeup
when you got to the airport.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.713
You can't put on makeup
without looking at yourself.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.798
You can't look at yourself
without touching that thing.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.050
Why does this
matter to you?

22:24.385 --> 22:27.637
It's an anomaly.
Anomalies bug me.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.100
Then you're
gonna suffer.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.491
I think
it's his stomach.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.201
I teal indigent.

22:50.327 --> 22:52.287
Was it something
you ate?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.539
He keeps
doing that.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.458
I teal indigent.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.084
- Are you hungry?
- No.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.377
No, he's in pain.
Is it a sharp pain?

22:59.503 --> 23:03.339
No. Teal indigent!

23:03.591 --> 23:05.133
- Taste?
- Yes.

23:05.426 --> 23:08.511
- A metallic taste?
- Yes!

23:09.722 --> 23:11.598
I'll be right back.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.563
I suppose it's also
possible that the clasp broke,

23:19.440 --> 23:21.524
but then you'd be carrying
the thing around
in your purse...

23:21.650 --> 23:23.109
We had a fight.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.570
We had a fight,
and I was angry
and not thinking straight,

23:25.696 --> 23:27.864
and I walked out
without my makeup
and without my cross.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.575
I stopped at the drugstore
to buy makeup,
but I couldn't buy a cross,

23:30.701 --> 23:34.370
because they
don't have an aisle
for personal talismans!

23:37.500 --> 23:40.335
So you had a fight.
I'm sure it'll blow over.

23:40.461 --> 23:42.545
- It was about nothing.
- Of course it was.

23:42.671 --> 23:46.299
Mark's tired. He's worried.
He's got mobility problems.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.676
It's normal to blow up
over little things.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.428
I don't mind fighting
over little things.

23:50.554 --> 23:54.474
I didn't mind
fighting over big things.
That I could understand.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.434
We fight over nothing.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.854
You know, a mailbox
with a sign that says,
"Last pickup 5:00 p.m".

23:59.980 --> 24:02.857
Does that mean last pickup
to go to the post office,

24:02.983 --> 24:06.611
or last pickup to leave
the post office
and be sent out of town?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.947
You fought over
mail delivery?

24:09.073 --> 24:11.449
I tried to get him to drop
the subject, but he wouldn't.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.160
I told him he was right.
He thought
I was being condescending.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.578
You were.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.498
He's pushing me
out of his life.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.417
Maybe
you're misinterpreting.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.505
Did I misinterpret with you?

24:26.215 --> 24:28.424
At least,
this time I recognize it.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.302
That's the benefit of
convincing the only two men
you've ever loved

24:31.428 --> 24:33.513
they're better off
without you.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.101
Yeah, it's all your fault.

24:38.352 --> 24:42.647
You know, "Stacy" in
the original Greek
means "relationship killer."

24:52.700 --> 24:56.494
I'm going to go wash my face,
so I look like a grownup
again.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.335
Hello.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.424
It's for you.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.427
- House.
- Do you know your phone's dead?

25:12.553 --> 25:13.928
Do you ever
recharge your batteries?

25:14.054 --> 25:15.013
They recharge?

25:15.139 --> 25:16.723
I just keep buying
new phones.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.143
I thought you should know
your aphasia guy
is tasting metal.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.352
Where's his creatinine?

25:21.478 --> 25:23.396
6.8. He's got kidney failure.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.608
Cameron's got him on dialysis,
and he's stable
for the moment.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.943
Unlike Cuddy, who's suicidal.

25:29.111 --> 25:33.281
It's either meningitis
or encephalitis.
Or maybe autoimmune.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.407
That's perfect.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.827
Seems like you really
narrowed it down over dinner.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.330
Here's the plan.
We talk to House.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.165
We've been trying.
He's not answering his cell.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.958
It's obvious we have to do
the lumbar puncture.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.085
There's no choice anymore.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.923
You have to do it just right.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.341
What are you talking about?

25:51.467 --> 25:54.886
Either you've decided to do
a lumbar puncture,
or you have to fire me

25:55.012 --> 25:58.932
so that I can't fire
all of you as soon as
I get back in charge.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.516
Is Cuddy there, ranting?

26:00.643 --> 26:02.435
If I'd known
you'd be out of contact...

26:02.561 --> 26:04.354
- They can handle it.
- Right.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.773
So far, only three
organ systems have failed.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.733
Okay, they can't.
Doesn't matter.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.485
The guy's not stable enough
to move.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.487
So go rant in your own office.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.697
Fine.
Call me when you're done.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.038
What do you mean
by doing the LP just right?

26:22.164 --> 26:23.373
We're not gonna screw it up.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.333
The odds are, this guy knows
something we don't.

26:25.668 --> 26:29.504
He could know the answer to
the meaning of life,
the man can't communicate!

26:29.630 --> 26:31.005
Have you had any indication

26:31.131 --> 26:33.216
that he's tried to communicate
something important?

26:33.342 --> 26:34.509
No.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.594
Well, that's because you guys
haven't scared him enough.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.347
I'm sure you've been all,
"Oh, we'll take
real good care of you".

26:39.473 --> 26:40.848
Why should he say anything?

26:40.975 --> 26:43.893
When you prep him,
tell him he's gonna die.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.938
Crush all hope.
Don't let Cameron do it.

26:48.399 --> 26:51.359
Cuddy, you got a problem
with any of that?

26:56.198 --> 26:57.991
You're scheduled
for a lumbar puncture,

26:58.117 --> 27:00.827
but you shouldn't count
on that having the answers.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.621
If your husband
continues to decline...

27:04.665 --> 27:06.082
You'll die.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.548
If there's anything
you haven't told us...

27:31.608 --> 27:33.484
How you holding up?

27:37.072 --> 27:40.450
I know what you just heard
is scary as hell, but...

27:42.453 --> 27:47.790
Couldn't tackle the bear.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.751
They took my stain.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.589
Attention, please.

27:54.715 --> 27:59.218
Due to weather conditions,
all flights are grounded
till further notice.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.305
Cots are being provided
on the lower level.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.390
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.100
I don't believe it.

28:06.810 --> 28:10.355
You want me to run down
and reserve you
a cot with a view?

28:10.606 --> 28:12.482
Where's
your knapsack?

28:12.608 --> 28:14.233
Checked it through.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.528
That's right. I forgot.
It's hard for you
to carry and walk.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.740
I booked a room
at the airport hotel when I
saw how bad the weather was.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.492
It's the last one
available.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.455
Your leg can't handle
a night on a cot.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.415
Thanks.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.459
I'm ready.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.336
Right.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.048
The hotel's upstairs.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.552
Does Mark know
about this?

28:41.678 --> 28:42.637
Mark knows that
when things are bad,

28:42.763 --> 28:45.723
I always like to have
an escape route planned.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.418
I have to know
what's going on here.

29:15.295 --> 29:19.340
Because when you
have a fight with Mark
and you try to avoid me,

29:20.134 --> 29:21.175
then I have to
think that...

29:21.301 --> 29:23.636
That I'm feeling vulnerable,
and I don't want to be
around you,

29:23.762 --> 29:26.305
because it might lead
to something.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.390
Right.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.476
But then,
a hotel room...

29:31.478 --> 29:33.729
Might also
lead to something.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.233
So, which is it?

29:41.780 --> 29:43.489
Our relationship's
like an addiction.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.576
It's like...

29:47.244 --> 29:48.828
Really good drugs?

29:49.037 --> 29:52.665
No, it's like Vindaloo curry.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.126
Okay, sure.

29:55.252 --> 29:58.212
Really, really hot
Indian curry they make
with red chili peppers.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.881
I know what it is.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.425
Didn't think
it was addictive.

30:02.551 --> 30:05.470
You're abrasive and annoying,
and you come on
way too strong.

30:05.596 --> 30:08.347
Like Vindaloo curry.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.183
And when you're crazy
about curry, that's fine.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.351
But no matter
how much you love curry,

30:12.478 --> 30:15.521
you have too much of it,
it takes
the roof of your mouth off.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.816
And then you never want
to see curry for
a really, really long time.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.652
But you wake up one day
and you think,

30:24.490 --> 30:26.657
"God, I really miss curry."

30:43.383 --> 30:44.759
You're a jerk.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.260
I know.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.747
If you hadn't just had
a fight with Mark...

31:14.873 --> 31:17.500
For once in your life,
will you shut up?

31:34.601 --> 31:35.810
House.

31:36.103 --> 31:37.937
You're on speakerphone.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.605
How did the LP go?

31:40.315 --> 31:42.567
Give me the Reader's Digest
condensed version.

31:42.693 --> 31:46.195
Preliminary results are
some kind of infection which

31:47.072 --> 31:48.823
narrows it down...

31:49.199 --> 31:50.908
From infinity, yeah.

31:51.702 --> 31:55.788
At the rate his organs
are deteriorating,
he's got maybe a day or two.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.250
Okay. Well, call me back
when you have something.

31:59.376 --> 32:01.711
He was trying
to tell us something.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.011
What did he say?

32:10.137 --> 32:13.681
You were wrong.
It wasn't the fear.
He opened up to me when I...

32:13.807 --> 32:16.642
A sympathetic presence
after a traumatic moment.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.646
Classic interrogation
technique. What did he say?

32:21.023 --> 32:22.189
You knew that I'd...

32:22.316 --> 32:25.693
Act the way you always do?
Yeah, I did. What did he say?

32:26.695 --> 32:28.613
He couldn't tackle the bear.

32:29.239 --> 32:32.074
Now all we need
is the English-Aphasic
dictionary.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.619
A fluent aphasic retrieves
words that are stored

32:34.745 --> 32:36.037
somewhere close
to the one he wants.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.081
They could be filed by sound
or by meanings.

32:39.207 --> 32:40.916
So if he wants to say "table",

32:41.043 --> 32:44.045
he could say "label"
or he could say "chair."

32:44.588 --> 32:47.673
Or he could just say
"jabberwocky".
There's no way to tell.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.551
He also said,
"They took my stain."

32:52.679 --> 32:53.929
Hold on.

32:56.683 --> 33:01.270
I'm gonna take this phone
downstairs, so I don't
disturb you. Is that okay?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.605
Sure.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.108
Keep him talking.
Write down everything he says.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.696
Stacy.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.911
That new makeup you bought,
do you mind if I borrow it?

33:22.793 --> 33:26.629
What did you mean by "stain"?
Dirty, soiled...

33:26.922 --> 33:28.631
No, no.

33:28.757 --> 33:32.218
What about rhymes?
Pain? Brain?

33:32.636 --> 33:33.844
Thane?

33:34.721 --> 33:39.308
He is dying from some kind of
infection, and you all are
playing word games?

33:39.434 --> 33:42.061
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?

33:50.696 --> 33:53.322
Let's start this again.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.785
"Bear." Is it "bare"
as in "naked"?

34:36.491 --> 34:39.243
Crimson Desire
shows up well on Sheetrock.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.412
That's why I chose it.

34:55.802 --> 34:58.596
You must have gotten
one new phrase out of him.
Something.

34:58.722 --> 35:02.641
We've been talking to him
for hours.
Maybe he's just given up.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.519
You sure you've told me
everything you found
at his home and office?

35:05.645 --> 35:07.229
No, we're
hiding something.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.814
Maybe it's not
a rhyme or a synonym.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.274
What else is there?

35:10.400 --> 35:12.610
You think we should just
start guessing randomly?

35:12.736 --> 35:14.445
Maybe House is wrong.

35:15.655 --> 35:17.323
Hope that's not
the end of the thought.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.659
He mentioned "stain"
once before, when Chase
was giving him the MRI.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.745
- Before we scared him.
- He did?

35:22.871 --> 35:24.789
It's in your notes.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.959
So he only talks during
MRIs and lumbar punctures?

35:29.294 --> 35:32.213
Your theory is he can only
talk with a needle
in his back or...

35:32.339 --> 35:34.757
When his wife's
not in the room.

35:37.469 --> 35:41.138
The more devoted,
the more reason to lie.

35:42.557 --> 35:44.016
That's cynical.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.518
You disagree?

35:45.644 --> 35:48.896
No, I'm just kvelling.
Our little girl is growing up.

35:49.481 --> 35:53.192
Okay, what's the best way
to rip a woman from the side
of her dying husband?

35:53.318 --> 35:56.278
You woke me up
to lie to a patient's wife?

35:56.404 --> 35:59.198
Tell her there's been
a miscommunication over
their insurance coverage.

35:59.324 --> 36:00.699
Not a big deal.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.078
Tell me.
If it is your aim to sell me

36:04.204 --> 36:08.707
the same crazy ideas that
House does, how are you
an improvement on House?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.709
I brought you a coffee.

36:15.465 --> 36:18.300
Your flight's been
boarding for 20 minutes.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.552
I'll take a later one.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.845
Greg, they can't leave
without you.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.138
You checked your knapsack.

36:24.057 --> 36:25.641
- Are we in?
- Yeah.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.853
Hi. I'm Gregory House.
I'm your attending physician.

36:29.479 --> 36:31.814
Your wife's not there.
Start talking.

36:32.023 --> 36:36.652
They took my stain.
I couldn't tackle the bear.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.279
They took my stain.

36:38.405 --> 36:41.657
Okay, shut up now.
Nice work, Cameron.
Give him the list again.

36:41.783 --> 36:43.617
Let us know when
something sounds right.

36:43.743 --> 36:48.706
Dirty, soiled, pain, brain...

36:48.832 --> 36:49.874
Yes.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.084
Where does that get us?

36:52.210 --> 36:54.461
We're already paying plenty of
attention to his brain.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.255
We've got an MRI, got a CT...

36:56.381 --> 36:59.592
Are we sure he wasn't
reacting to "pain"?
He's been on painkillers.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.093
Oh, come on, Chase.

37:01.261 --> 37:04.263
Drugs didn't do this to him,
even if he is an addict.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.348
I dissuade the tonal category.

37:06.474 --> 37:09.852
Oh, please,
Mr. Sleeping Pills,
Amphetamines,

37:10.270 --> 37:12.688
Bring Me Up, Bring Me Down...

37:12.814 --> 37:16.233
Will passenger Gregory House
please report to Gate 7.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.485
Gregory House to Gate 7.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.866
Ever hear this one?

37:23.992 --> 37:27.661
You build a house. Each wall
has a southern exposure.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.832
A big bear comes wandering by.
What color is the bear?

37:32.000 --> 37:36.003
White. It's a polar bear.
You built your house
in the North Pole.

37:36.212 --> 37:40.382
Polar. Whatever your name is.
Patient! Are you bipolar?

37:42.636 --> 37:44.470
What? I can't see.
Is he nodding?

37:44.596 --> 37:45.679
Yes.

37:46.890 --> 37:51.560
Topamax isn't just off-label
for weight loss. It's
off-label for mood disorders.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.688
Plenty of bipolars are manic
in the daytime,
depressive at night.

37:54.814 --> 37:58.442
He's been medicating for years
with alcohol, sleeping through
the bad hours.

37:58.568 --> 37:59.860
It explains
the danger journalism.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.863
Explains everything,
including the kitchen sink.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.782
Okay, technically, it's
the kitchen cabinets.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.742
He starts a project,
then he stops.

38:06.868 --> 38:10.120
Except bipolar disorder
does not cause seizures.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.748
And it doesn't shut down
your kidneys.
But what it does do...

38:12.874 --> 38:13.999
Excuse me, sir.
May I see your ID?

38:14.125 --> 38:15.709
I'm on the phone.
I'm on the phone.

38:15.835 --> 38:16.919
Now, please.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.420
House? What is it?

38:18.546 --> 38:20.673
I'm a doctor.
This is an emergency call.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.549
You have to
come with me, sir.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.927
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Do you think you're gonna take me on?

38:25.053 --> 38:26.679
I kick and I bite.

38:27.222 --> 38:30.766
You're either on that plane,
or you're going into custody.

38:38.108 --> 38:39.108
House?

38:39.234 --> 38:40.234
Are you still there?

38:40.777 --> 38:43.153
Being bipolar
makes you take risks.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.156
You seek excitement,
you make up stories.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.659
I dime value tale lever!

38:48.785 --> 38:52.955
Fine, maybe your stories
are legit. But people
would start to wonder.

38:53.081 --> 38:56.834
Annoyed politicians,
entire governments
would be on your ass.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.838
So you couldn't tell anybody
you were bipolar.
Which was fine.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.799
Until you fell in love.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.886
And you wanted that life.

39:09.431 --> 39:12.307
And you hear
that there's a surgical cure.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.645
You can give the woman you
love the life she wants.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.440
All you have to do is change.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.738
Bilateral cingulotomy.

39:25.864 --> 39:29.950
An experimental surgery that
some people claim helps
mood disorders.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.828
And if it's done by
Gamma Knife,
there's no trace of cutting.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.830
That's the neural scarring
we saw on the MRI.

39:34.956 --> 39:37.916
Which explained nothing,
because it wasn't even
in the right area.

39:38.043 --> 39:40.669
It's not the surgery,
it's the secrecy.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.297
What causes recurring fever,

39:43.423 --> 39:44.465
neurological problems,

39:44.591 --> 39:47.509
lethargy that you fight
with caffeine pills
and amphetamines?

39:47.635 --> 39:49.678
It wasn't
your secret psych disorder.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.930
It wasn't your
secret daily drug use.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.433
It was your secret trip
for your secret surgery

39:54.559 --> 39:56.685
in Caracas or Buenos Aires.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.980
Which, by the way,
didn't work, given the state
of your kitchen cabinets.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.399
House. Shut up.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.278
What's going on?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.367
Is he right?

40:15.413 --> 40:18.624
Your doctors know you
better than I do.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.252
That man on the speakerphone,
he never even met you,

40:22.378 --> 40:24.838
and he knows you
better than I do.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.968
You love me?

40:33.723 --> 40:36.475
Yes. Yes.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.685
You just don't trust me.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.234
Get some blood on a slide.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.277
Do not put it through
a computer this time.

40:47.403 --> 40:48.487
Yeah.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.711
Cerebral malaria.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.050
I'll get him started
on intravenous quinidine.

41:11.219 --> 41:15.013
If a human being had actually
looked at his blood
anywhere along the way,

41:15.140 --> 41:18.392
instead of just running tests
through the computer,

41:18.810 --> 41:21.812
the parasites would have
jumped right out at them.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.398
Price of the electronic age.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.622
Fletch.

41:41.875 --> 41:43.333
She'll be back.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.216
Give her time to miss you.

41:59.893 --> 42:01.935
Final boarding call
for Flight Number 7...

42:02.061 --> 42:03.979
I'm counting on you
to get me off the no-fly list.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.731
Is your patient
gonna be all right?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.859
- Physically, his chances are good.
- Physically?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.737
Two people who weren't
meant to be together.

42:11.863 --> 42:14.948
Maybe they'll get
a happy ending just because
they both want it so much.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.992
Yeah, that's usually
the way it works.

42:17.118 --> 42:20.746
He loved her enough
to convince himself
he could change.

42:22.457 --> 42:24.416
But he couldn't, could he?

42:28.963 --> 42:30.339
Thank you.

42:31.257 --> 42:34.426
You know what Woody Allen said
about relationships.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.845
Irrational and crazy,
but we go through it all
because...

42:36.971 --> 42:38.555
We need the curry.
