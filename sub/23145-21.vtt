04:21.250 --> 04:22.375
Wha-- what else can I do?

04:22.458 --> 04:25.250
One word -- ventriloquy.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.750
Ventriloquism?

04:26.834 --> 04:28.166
Puppet-talkin'.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.125
One word.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.667
In the '70's,
I was half of the most popular

04:31.750 --> 04:33.834
ventril-agrgah act
in the world.

04:33.917 --> 04:35.250
I was the puppet.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.083
I was kicked off "Match Game"

04:37.166 --> 04:39.000
for saying the word "queef"
on air.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.583
But that's neither
here nor there.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.166
Point is, just like you,
my partner Dennis

04:43.250 --> 04:45.750
didn't know the first thing
about ventril-gahvel.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.291
But it didn't matter
because I do all the work.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.417
Hmm.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.542
Almost sounds
too good to be true.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.709
That's the spirit!

04:52.792 --> 04:54.667
But...there is one thing

04:54.750 --> 04:56.125
I'm going to need from you.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.875
Total commitment.

04:57.959 --> 04:59.792
Deal.
Good.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.417
Because this is perhaps
my most challenging character,

05:02.500 --> 05:03.917
both physically
and mentally.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.917
Even more than my

05:05.000 --> 05:06.875
mentally challenged
bodybuilder character,

05:06.959 --> 05:08.875
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.000
First,
I have to apply several layers

05:11.083 --> 05:12.834
of this pungent lacquer
face paint

05:12.917 --> 05:14.917
to really make it look like
I'm made out of wood.

05:15.875 --> 05:16.792
Which is important,

05:16.875 --> 05:18.208
because almost
all of my material

05:18.291 --> 05:19.667
is wood-based puns.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.542
Ugh!

05:21.625 --> 05:24.458
It smells worse than
Principal Lewis's index finger.

05:24.542 --> 05:25.667
Then...

05:25.750 --> 05:26.917
...painful prosthetics

05:27.000 --> 05:29.500
to give me fully-flappable
eyebrows and ears.

05:29.583 --> 05:33.291
And finally, I inject just
a scosche of paralyzing agent

05:33.375 --> 05:34.667
into my arms and legs.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.583
Wow! You move
just like a dummy!

05:38.667 --> 05:41.250
Now, Steve, why do you think
I slapped you?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.041
It's because you used
a certain word.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.834
Do you know
what that word is?
Is it...

05:44.917 --> 05:46.000
That's right!

05:46.083 --> 05:48.125
Never, ever
call me a dummy.

05:48.208 --> 05:50.041
The word "dummy"
is degrading.

05:50.125 --> 05:54.917
I am a manually-articulated
performative kinesio-maquette...

06:54.959 --> 06:57.125
The brakes on Carla's bike
somehow gave out!

06:57.208 --> 06:59.208
And she crashed
right into the flagpole!

07:01.709 --> 07:05.000

took a tumble.

09:13.041 --> 09:14.542
How about I poke you
right in the eye, huh?

09:14.625 --> 09:17.250
Or put my fist
in your mouth?

09:17.333 --> 09:19.291

How about that?

09:19.375 --> 09:20.583
Nom! Nom! Nom!
Nom! Nom!

09:20.667 --> 09:22.208
More slaps!

09:22.291 --> 09:23.500
Enough of this!

09:23.583 --> 09:24.834
I need to hydrate.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.375

Wh-- what happened?

09:44.458 --> 09:45.375
Freak accident.

A barbell
crushed A.J.'s larynx --

09:47.583 --> 09:49.750
the exact body part
that all but guaranteed him

09:49.834 --> 09:51.250
to beat you
in the talent show.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.750
Can you believe it --
the coincidence?

09:53.834 --> 09:55.333
Anyway,
the reason I called you

09:55.417 --> 09:57.875
is because we found your puppet
lying on the floor in here.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.166
You ought to keep
better track of this guy, Smith.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.709
Hey, where do you put your hand
in this thing anywa--

10:02.792 --> 10:04.000
Oh, never mind.
I found it.

10:05.917 --> 10:07.041
Please tell me
you didn't have

10:07.125 --> 10:08.834
anything to do
with A.J.'s accident.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.417
Let's just say
that as far as us

10:10.500 --> 10:12.458
winning
the talent show goes,

10:12.542 --> 10:15.917
the bar was just lowered.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.041
That, uh --

10:17.125 --> 10:18.917
that's not
the most convincing denial.

10:20.125 --> 10:21.333
Hey, check it out.
