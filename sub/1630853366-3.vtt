WEBVTT

01:29.379 --> 01:32.966
- Let's talk logistics
if we were to move forward.

01:32.966 --> 01:34.593
- All right.

01:34.593 --> 01:37.470
So we're gonna do it
every other week

01:37.470 --> 01:38.680
on a Tuesday or Thursday

01:38.680 --> 01:40.390
because Jason's in preschool
those days,

01:40.390 --> 01:44.060
and three out of four will be
plenty enough to cover errands.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.353
- It should be a motel.

01:45.353 --> 01:47.480
- Yes, somewhere close
to your office.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.108
I'll bring lunch so we can have
your entire break.

01:50.108 --> 01:53.486
I will handle check in,
clean up, same reason.

01:53.486 --> 01:55.780
- Always pay cash.
- Of course.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.240
But I do think it's important

01:57.240 --> 01:58.658
that we split costs
afterwards--

01:58.658 --> 02:02.912
right down the middle so
there's no sense of--you know.

02:02.912 --> 02:05.749
Oh, and um,
most important rule.

02:08.626 --> 02:10.962
If either of us start
to develop feelings

02:10.962 --> 02:13.465
for the other, it's over,
right then and there.

02:13.465 --> 02:16.176
I mean,
that's how you get caught.

02:16.176 --> 02:17.677
Oh, and never call the house.

02:17.677 --> 02:19.512
Not even if you know
that Pat is not gonna be home.

02:19.512 --> 02:20.722
Becky and Jason are smarter
than you think.

02:20.722 --> 02:22.766
- I still have to go
by the deli.

02:24.559 --> 02:26.770
Well, we don't wanna
get caught before we start.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.605
- If we start.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.028
- The longer you delay,
the more I'm gonna expect

02:35.028 --> 02:37.864
from you,
in terms of the bedroom.

02:40.659 --> 02:42.577
- I realize that.

02:52.671 --> 02:54.381
- Allan Gore.

02:54.381 --> 02:56.091
- I'm pregnant.

02:58.426 --> 03:00.220
- Oh, my God.

03:02.681 --> 03:04.265
Are you sure?

03:04.265 --> 03:06.101
- I just came from the doctor.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.981
- Oh, my God.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.237
- Why are you crying?

03:17.237 --> 03:18.947
- 'Cause I still haven't gotten

03:18.947 --> 03:20.865
the baby weight off
from Christina.

03:20.865 --> 03:24.160
And the second one's
supposed to be even worse.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.372
- Oh, who cares?
- You care.

03:27.372 --> 03:28.873
- I don't care.

03:28.873 --> 03:32.419
- Yes, you do, and you know
what I'm talking about.

03:32.419 --> 03:35.505
- Okay, I'm not having
this conversation at work.

03:35.505 --> 03:36.965
I'm telling you right now,

03:36.965 --> 03:40.135
this better not be
like last time, okay?

03:40.135 --> 03:41.886
- Okay, yeah.
Love you, honey. Bye.

04:31.853 --> 04:33.771
It's me.

04:33.771 --> 04:36.024
Let's do it.

04:36.024 --> 04:38.401
- Now, what did I say
about calling the house?

05:00.632 --> 05:02.759
Oh, I like that shirt on you.

05:02.759 --> 05:04.302
- Oh, thanks.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.891
Have a great day.
- Thank you.

05:14.437 --> 05:16.356
Bye.
- Bye.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.758
- Oh, great.

07:48.758 --> 07:49.842
I'm starving.

08:01.938 --> 08:04.524
Oh, she just has no respect
for what I do.

08:04.524 --> 08:06.484
I mean, any little question
pops into her head,

08:06.484 --> 08:08.736
she'll just call me
at the office.

08:13.116 --> 08:15.910
- Well, we've eaten everything.

08:15.910 --> 08:19.622
- Yes, we sure have.

08:45.732 --> 08:46.733
Thank you.

09:05.668 --> 09:07.170
Aren't you gonna do anything?

09:09.422 --> 09:11.257
- Not if you're not going to.

09:29.609 --> 09:31.944
- Well, I have news.
- Oh?

09:31.944 --> 09:34.655
- I have taken a lover.

09:34.655 --> 09:36.073
- What?

09:37.909 --> 09:40.953
Wow. Okay. Uh, who is it?

09:40.953 --> 09:43.498
- No, I can't.
- You come on.

09:43.498 --> 09:45.875
- If you keep digging, I'm not
gonna tell you anything at all.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.002
- All right.

09:48.002 --> 09:49.629
- I just can't have this thing
getting out.

09:49.629 --> 09:51.214
You know, I don't want
the other wives to feel like

09:51.214 --> 09:52.423
I'm some kind of a threat.

09:52.423 --> 09:54.717
- I knew he was married.
- Sherry.

09:54.717 --> 09:56.052
- I--Fine.

09:59.305 --> 10:01.182
- Yesterday was the first time.

10:02.683 --> 10:03.935
- Where?

10:03.935 --> 10:08.606
- At a motel,
a sleazy one in Dallas.

10:08.606 --> 10:11.984
- Jesus.
Were you nervous or what?

10:11.984 --> 10:15.696
- Honestly, I was just
so worried that the sex

10:15.696 --> 10:16.948
was gonna be average.

10:16.948 --> 10:18.074
And I know it
makes me horrible--

10:18.074 --> 10:19.367
- It does not.

10:19.367 --> 10:20.660
- I just don't wanna go through
all this trouble

10:20.660 --> 10:22.411
if it's something
I can have at home, you know?

10:22.411 --> 10:24.622
I mean, if I'm gonna risk
my whole life,

10:24.622 --> 10:26.541
I just want fireworks.

10:28.334 --> 10:29.585
- And?

10:29.585 --> 10:31.003
- Let me have that
little screwdriver--

10:31.003 --> 10:32.380
- You--Candance Montgomery,
if you don't gimme details

10:32.380 --> 10:33.798
this second, I'm gonna take
the little screwdriver

10:33.798 --> 10:35.091
and I'ma shove it in your ear.

10:37.009 --> 10:38.511
- I think he might have
the most beautiful penis

10:38.511 --> 10:39.679
I've ever seen.

10:41.430 --> 10:43.516
- Mommy! Mommy!
Watch our dance.

10:51.149 --> 10:52.525
- Watch our dance.

10:52.525 --> 10:54.193
- I'm watching, girls.

11:07.999 --> 11:10.001
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:10.001 --> 11:11.878
Mom, it wasn't over.

11:16.591 --> 11:19.051
- It's so sweet that these
girls have become friends.

11:19.051 --> 11:22.430
- I know.
- Isn't it? Yeah.

11:22.430 --> 11:24.432
All we hear
from Christina these days

11:24.432 --> 11:25.808
is Becky this, Becky that.

11:27.518 --> 11:29.770
She's just so happy
to have a friend.

11:29.770 --> 11:32.732
- Well, she is welcome
over anytime for a sleepover.

11:32.732 --> 11:34.150
- Aww.

11:38.696 --> 11:41.073
I remember when I looked like
that and thought I was fat.

11:43.034 --> 11:44.827
- You're not fat.

11:46.537 --> 11:48.414
- Just feel like a tub of lard,

11:48.414 --> 11:52.501
and it's just going
to get worse.

11:52.501 --> 11:53.878
I'm pregnant.

11:57.506 --> 12:01.177
- Oh, my God, Betty.
Congratulations.

12:08.225 --> 12:09.560
Is this hormones already?

12:09.560 --> 12:11.896
- No.

12:11.896 --> 12:13.189
Maybe.

12:16.317 --> 12:18.611
Pregnancy is magical
and everything,

12:18.611 --> 12:22.198
but last time...

12:24.241 --> 12:26.369
I just felt really alone.

12:28.704 --> 12:32.667
- Well, you're--
you're not really ever alone.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.877
- That's true.

12:34.877 --> 12:36.671
- You got Allan.

12:38.381 --> 12:41.467
- Allan didn't, um,

12:41.467 --> 12:43.844
pay much attention to me

12:43.844 --> 12:45.680
when I was pregnant
with Christina.

12:49.141 --> 12:52.436
The weird thing is, he's been
looking really good lately.

12:56.023 --> 13:01.153
- I wonder if he's got this
Madonna-whore complex thingy,

13:01.153 --> 13:04.156
you know, where the baby is
making it impossible for him

13:04.156 --> 13:07.702
to look at you
as a sexual creature.

13:07.702 --> 13:10.955
It's very common,
says Ladies' Home Journal.

13:10.955 --> 13:11.998
- Well.

13:13.624 --> 13:16.669
Oh, God,
that sounds really bad.

13:16.669 --> 13:18.713
- No, it's good that
he sees you as the Madonna.

13:18.713 --> 13:21.632
You just gotta remind him
that you can also be the...

13:22.883 --> 13:24.593
You know what.

13:29.223 --> 13:32.143
- You know, nobody else
talks to me like this.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.438
- You're welcome.

13:35.438 --> 13:37.356
- I mean--

13:40.484 --> 13:42.737
- I'd like to host
your baby shower.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.617
- You don't have to.
- Nonsense.

13:48.617 --> 13:51.370
I've got the best party house.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.039
- You do. Um.

13:55.374 --> 13:57.668
I don't know what to say.

13:57.668 --> 13:59.754
- Well, just say yes.
- Yes.

13:59.754 --> 14:01.881
- Okay. It's settled then.

14:01.881 --> 14:03.215
- It's settled.

14:07.762 --> 14:09.096
She just told me
the news,

14:09.096 --> 14:10.514
and I just--
I couldn't help myself.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.183
I was overwhelmed,
and I offered.

14:12.183 --> 14:13.392
Why would you offer that?

14:13.392 --> 14:15.019
- Because I have
the best party house.

14:15.019 --> 14:18.898
And I think I might be
her only friend.

14:18.898 --> 14:20.357
Congratulations, by the way,

14:20.357 --> 14:22.860
you can already start to see
her cute little belly.

14:27.323 --> 14:31.452
Well,
we should get on with it.

14:31.452 --> 14:33.204
Come over here
and unzip me, please.

14:33.204 --> 14:34.622
Yep.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.375
- Is there something else
you wanna try this time,

14:38.375 --> 14:40.086
you just let me know, okay?

14:42.046 --> 14:44.548
I've just been really hormonal,

14:44.548 --> 14:48.511
but I've decided I'm not
going to do that anymore.

14:48.511 --> 14:50.137
For the next seven months,

14:50.137 --> 14:53.432
I'm-I'm going to have
a positive attitude.

14:54.975 --> 14:56.018
- Okay.

15:02.608 --> 15:05.653
Betty, what are you doing?

15:08.781 --> 15:12.118
- What if tonight...

15:17.331 --> 15:19.333
I'm not Betty?

15:21.252 --> 15:23.129
- What is this?

15:23.129 --> 15:26.048
- Well,

15:26.048 --> 15:28.384
Candy said it's really simple.

15:28.384 --> 15:29.593
- Candy?

15:33.973 --> 15:37.309
- I'm the mother
of your children,

15:37.309 --> 15:40.187
but that's not all I am.

15:40.187 --> 15:41.730
What's wrong?

15:41.730 --> 15:43.315
- Why are you talking
to Candy Montgomery

15:43.315 --> 15:45.901
about our sex life?
- I'm not talking to--

15:45.901 --> 15:48.070
- You think Candy and Pat
are having some kind

15:48.070 --> 15:50.239
of great sex or something?

15:50.239 --> 15:53.075
- I-I don't know.

15:53.075 --> 15:55.536
- No, I'm just,
I'm-I'm trying to understand

15:55.536 --> 15:57.079
where all this is coming from.

15:57.079 --> 15:59.915
It's coming from--I--

15:59.915 --> 16:02.084
I love you, that's it.

16:04.962 --> 16:07.381
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:19.268 --> 16:20.769
- Dog needs a walk.

16:53.886 --> 16:55.763
Has everyone had a chance
to review my proposal?

16:55.763 --> 16:58.557
Yes, we read it.

16:58.557 --> 17:01.727
10 grand. Are you nuts?

17:01.727 --> 17:03.896
It is a rather high number.

17:03.896 --> 17:06.273
The parsonage is in bad shape.

17:06.273 --> 17:10.069
The toilet needs replacing,
there's exposed insulation

17:10.069 --> 17:11.779
coming out
of a hole in the paneling.

17:11.779 --> 17:14.323
- Well, this isn't
the Ewing ranch.

17:14.323 --> 17:16.200
We all work on our own homes.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.534
Maybe it'd be more helpful

17:17.534 --> 17:19.578
if we went through
the items one by one.

17:19.578 --> 17:22.248
- Would you like me to suggest

17:22.248 --> 17:25.334
what I think you should do
with the items one by one?

17:42.977 --> 17:45.771
- We are with you
on the money issue.

17:45.771 --> 17:47.481
As far as
we're concerned, his proposal

17:47.481 --> 17:48.983
is dead on arrival.

17:48.983 --> 17:51.735
- That man has lost his mind.

17:51.735 --> 17:54.363
- Now, when you were being
rather direct

17:54.363 --> 17:55.781
with Reverend Ron--

17:55.781 --> 17:57.032
- Marriage Encounter
has taught us

17:57.032 --> 17:58.909
that sometimes when we're angry
about one thing,

17:58.909 --> 18:00.869
it's really
about something else.

18:00.869 --> 18:02.246
- Marriage Encounter?

18:02.246 --> 18:04.164
Mm-hmm.
We gave it a shot,

18:04.164 --> 18:08.002
and we're more connected now
than we've ever been.

18:08.002 --> 18:11.297
- Well, um,
Allan and I are fine.

18:11.297 --> 18:13.382
- Oh, Marriage Encounter
isn't for problem marriages.

18:13.382 --> 18:16.719
No, it's just a community
of love and support.

18:16.719 --> 18:18.345
- Our favorite is
the love ring.

18:18.345 --> 18:19.597
- Mm-hmm.

18:19.597 --> 18:23.309
- I don't--is that a sex thing?

18:23.309 --> 18:25.811
- Oh, no.
Blessings.

18:25.811 --> 18:28.314
- Hey.
- Goodbye, Elaine.

18:28.314 --> 18:31.275
No, it's a phone.

18:31.275 --> 18:35.029
See, one couple will call
another couple any ole time.

18:35.029 --> 18:37.072
They'll let it ring once
and they hang up.

18:37.072 --> 18:38.324
Just a little something
to let 'em know

18:38.324 --> 18:39.742
they're thinking about 'em.

18:39.742 --> 18:41.118
They're very smart.

18:41.118 --> 18:42.244
It's beyond psychology.

18:42.244 --> 18:44.538
It's about emotions.
- Mm-hmm.

18:44.538 --> 18:46.290
So it's for good marriages,

18:46.290 --> 18:48.667
and we're all just here
to help each other.

18:48.667 --> 18:53.672
And well, it affects
all sorts of things.

19:08.187 --> 19:09.355
All right.

19:11.273 --> 19:13.400
I'm gonna get a jog in.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.544
- I'm having feelings for you.

20:15.129 --> 20:16.463
What?

20:16.463 --> 20:18.632
Yeah, um,

20:18.632 --> 20:21.427
I caught myself staring at you
at choir practicing, and...

20:22.678 --> 20:24.096
Well, don't worry,
nobody noticed.

20:24.096 --> 20:27.349
But I--this is gonna have
to be the last time.

20:30.102 --> 20:32.396
- At choir practice?
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.273 --> 20:36.442
- Can we talk about it?

20:36.442 --> 20:38.485
- Well, a rule is a rule.

20:43.449 --> 20:44.741
- Well, we can't just stop.

20:46.535 --> 20:47.995
- Well, we have to.

20:51.623 --> 20:53.959
It has been fun
while it's lasted.

20:57.796 --> 20:59.339
Oh, you gotta go.

20:59.339 --> 21:00.549
Allan.

21:00.549 --> 21:03.635
- This can't be the last time,
Candy.

21:03.635 --> 21:04.803
- Well, it has to be--

21:04.803 --> 21:07.639
I know. I don't care.

21:09.391 --> 21:10.809
I need it.

21:13.812 --> 21:17.149
- Need what?
You, I--

21:17.149 --> 21:18.442
your body.

21:20.611 --> 21:22.362
The way that it moves.

21:26.658 --> 21:29.036
I haven't had enough.

21:29.036 --> 21:30.287
- You're gonna be late.

21:30.287 --> 21:31.580
I don't care.

21:44.301 --> 21:46.678
- Allan?
- Yeah?

21:49.348 --> 21:51.183
- Could you look up from that?

21:52.684 --> 21:54.019
- Yeah.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.735
- I wanna do something
with you,

22:01.735 --> 22:03.487
and it's very important to me.

22:05.697 --> 22:07.908
And I really think
it could help us.

22:11.787 --> 22:13.997
- Okay.

22:13.997 --> 22:16.458
- I wanna try
Marriage Encounter.

22:16.458 --> 22:19.795
- The "Ask me about ME" thing
that the Lockets do?

22:19.795 --> 22:22.047
- I know
it sounds really corny,

22:22.047 --> 22:26.468
but it's supposed
to be amazing.

22:26.468 --> 22:29.555
And I really think
we could have fun with it.

22:36.186 --> 22:40.649
- Hey, I think
it's a great idea.

22:40.649 --> 22:42.442
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:59.793 --> 23:01.336
Welcome.

23:02.838 --> 23:04.631
Everybody get a donut?

23:10.429 --> 23:12.306
Well, you followed
the treasure map,

23:12.306 --> 23:15.058
answered the Sphinx's riddle,
and you--

23:17.102 --> 23:18.395
Honey, what is it?

23:18.395 --> 23:19.771
Said the magic word.

23:19.771 --> 23:21.481
Oh, I get it wrong every time.

23:23.275 --> 23:25.027
Well, you made it.

23:25.027 --> 23:28.071
Welcome to the Marriage
Encounter weekend retreat,

23:28.071 --> 23:30.532
where Mary Lou and I,
we're gonna help you

23:30.532 --> 23:33.994
fall in love with your spouse
all over again.

23:38.206 --> 23:40.083
And there's only
one way to do that.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.044
That's right.

23:42.044 --> 23:44.880
We're gonna crack open your
relationships like a coconut.

23:46.590 --> 23:49.134
Scoop all the meat out.

23:49.134 --> 23:53.639
Now I know some of the men here
aren't very relaxed right now.

23:53.639 --> 23:56.266
You worked hard all week.

23:56.266 --> 23:59.353
You earned your time on
the golf course this weekend.

23:59.353 --> 24:01.980
And why a whole weekend, Jack?

24:01.980 --> 24:04.650
Well, let me answer that
question with another question.

24:06.526 --> 24:09.154
How many of you go on,
you know, business trips,

24:09.154 --> 24:11.490
weekend work seminars,
corporate retreats,

24:11.490 --> 24:12.908
that type of thing?

24:16.411 --> 24:19.039
Mm-hmm.

24:19.039 --> 24:21.208
Good. Good.

24:21.208 --> 24:23.502
Mm-hmm.

24:23.502 --> 24:25.629
If you're willing to invest
three days for your career,

24:25.629 --> 24:27.965
why not invest it in the most
important relationship

24:27.965 --> 24:29.383
in your entire life?

24:37.599 --> 24:41.269
Okay, here we go.
It's Friday night.

24:41.269 --> 24:43.021
Kids are in bed.

24:43.021 --> 24:44.690
Betty's cleaned up
after supper.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.441
You're on the couch
watching TV.

24:46.441 --> 24:48.527
I'm sure this is a familiar
occurrence in the Gore home,

24:48.527 --> 24:50.278
but tell me this.

24:50.278 --> 24:51.780
What happens next?

24:53.699 --> 24:55.993
- Can I say something?
- Yes. Turn to him.

24:55.993 --> 24:57.285
Speak directly to him.

25:02.541 --> 25:05.711
What are you doing
for yourself sexually?

25:07.838 --> 25:09.256
Well...

25:10.716 --> 25:15.053
Because I understand
your appetite going down

25:15.053 --> 25:17.931
while I'm pregnant, it's--

25:17.931 --> 25:19.391
but it just
would really help me

25:19.391 --> 25:21.977
if I knew
what it was you were doing.

25:21.977 --> 25:23.395
- Betty, this isn't--

25:24.730 --> 25:26.356
Is this what we're supposed
to be doing?

25:26.356 --> 25:29.317
- Whoop, whoop. Whoop.
Time out, time out. Okay.

25:29.317 --> 25:30.610
Allan, now, first of all,

25:30.610 --> 25:32.446
I know you're probably
listening to all this

25:32.446 --> 25:36.241
and everything's beep-bop,
beep-bop, bee-beep, right?

25:36.241 --> 25:37.826
Computers guy?

25:37.826 --> 25:39.494
But you're gonna answer
Betty's question

25:39.494 --> 25:41.580
in graphic detail, okay?

25:41.580 --> 25:43.331
And anything else that comes up

25:43.331 --> 25:44.708
'cause here's the secret,
all right?

25:44.708 --> 25:46.668
Before we get started,

25:46.668 --> 25:49.421
you're gonna make a commitment
to each other.

25:49.421 --> 25:52.966
You're gonna commit right now
to stay in this marriage

25:52.966 --> 25:54.968
no matter what is said
in this room.

25:56.595 --> 25:58.597
- That's how this works.
Hmm?

25:58.597 --> 26:01.057
Very smart people who came up
with Marriage Encounter studied

26:01.057 --> 26:03.602
a lot of couples,
hundreds of them.

26:03.602 --> 26:05.687
And they found
that the number one impediment

26:05.687 --> 26:09.149
to honest communication
is fear.

26:09.149 --> 26:12.944
Fear of it disrupting
the marriage.

26:12.944 --> 26:17.240
- So, um, we kind of make
a promise to each other

26:17.240 --> 26:19.826
that we're not gonna
hold anything

26:19.826 --> 26:23.121
against each other
no matter what it is?

26:23.121 --> 26:27.250
- Without that, how could
we be really honest?

26:59.157 --> 27:00.909
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:02.744 --> 27:07.040
- How was the weekend?
- It was tough but good.

27:07.040 --> 27:07.999
- Hi, Daddy.
Good.

27:07.999 --> 27:09.626
Hey, honey, come on.

27:09.626 --> 27:11.378
Thank you so much.
- Sure.

27:18.844 --> 27:20.137
Okay, hop in.

27:36.319 --> 27:37.988
Hey, how you doing? You okay?

27:44.995 --> 27:47.330
Is it okay to open this?

27:47.330 --> 27:48.498
- It's fine.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.294
Hey.

27:52.294 --> 27:54.504
Oh, I was thinking,
can't we just nuke these?

27:54.504 --> 27:57.173
- No, because they have
these fun little metal handles,

27:57.173 --> 27:59.759
and of course the princess
just had to have Chinese.

27:59.759 --> 28:02.178
My goddamn luck,
they forgot to put the--

28:02.178 --> 28:03.805
they forgot to put
the fortune cookies in the bag.

28:03.805 --> 28:05.765
- Okay. What is going on here?

28:07.434 --> 28:09.936
- I'm fucking Allan.

28:09.936 --> 28:11.897
- What?
- If you ever repeat that,

28:11.897 --> 28:14.649
I swear I'll tell everyone
you slept with Pat.

28:14.649 --> 28:17.527
- He's the beautiful penis?
- Sherry.

28:17.527 --> 28:19.070
- Just--I'm trying
to understand.

28:19.070 --> 28:21.197
I mean, how-how do you go
from that

28:21.197 --> 28:22.824
to hosting her baby shower?

28:22.824 --> 28:24.075
- Who else was gonna do it?

28:24.075 --> 28:25.827
And besides, we have
the best party house.

28:25.827 --> 28:27.871
We--oh, Lord, honey.

28:27.871 --> 28:30.332
Allan Gore?

28:30.332 --> 28:31.541
Isn't that kind of
a lateral move?

28:31.541 --> 28:33.168
- Give me a break, Sherry.

28:33.168 --> 28:34.502
Who else is there?

28:39.591 --> 28:43.386
May I present the woman
of the hour, Mrs. Betty Gore.

28:43.386 --> 28:45.430
There she is.
Oh!

28:45.430 --> 28:47.182
So beautiful.

28:47.182 --> 28:49.309
- I can't--

28:49.309 --> 28:52.103
goodness.

28:52.103 --> 28:56.066
Y-you did too much.
This is so beautiful.

28:56.066 --> 28:57.150
- Oh, my God, Betty.

28:57.150 --> 28:58.234
This is the best
you've ever looked.

28:58.234 --> 29:00.153
- Honestly,
you're one hot mama.

29:00.153 --> 29:02.113
- Thank you.

29:02.113 --> 29:04.115
- This is when I was gonna
pop that champagne.

29:04.115 --> 29:06.534
- What?
Nothing.

29:08.745 --> 29:12.290
- Sweetheart, I'm gonna go.
- Oh, can't you stay?

29:12.290 --> 29:13.959
Oh, no, I was gonna
get a-a new belt

29:13.959 --> 29:15.377
for the mower
and get the lawn done.

29:15.377 --> 29:16.962
You could do that later.

29:21.549 --> 29:23.343
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:23.343 --> 29:26.346
- Sure.

29:26.346 --> 29:29.391
I'll see if Pat's around.
Okay.

29:38.233 --> 29:41.569
- Oh, is Valerie not just
the most perfect name?

29:41.569 --> 29:44.990
- It is the perfect balance.

29:44.990 --> 29:47.158
Classic but not old fashioned,

29:47.158 --> 29:50.286
ripe for a comeback
but not overused.

29:50.286 --> 29:53.206
- And I said it before,
but I will say it again.

29:53.206 --> 29:56.376
I mean, this is the best
you've ever looked.

29:56.376 --> 29:57.669
- Thank you.

29:59.671 --> 30:01.673
- What was that?

30:01.673 --> 30:04.843
- What?
- You just winked at her.

30:04.843 --> 30:08.471
- Well, that glow,
it's not the baby.

30:08.471 --> 30:11.141
- Oh?
- It's Marriage Encounter.

30:14.477 --> 30:16.479
- Oh!
Oh, you're still doing that?

30:16.479 --> 30:18.940
- Yeah, we just became
Flame Leaders.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.692
- Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

30:20.692 --> 30:22.318
That's great.

30:22.318 --> 30:23.611
You know, Pat and I tried that,

30:23.611 --> 30:25.321
but we just didn't
really think it was for us.

30:25.321 --> 30:27.615
We left after one night.

30:27.615 --> 30:31.119
But, um, I'm, uh,
really happy for you.

30:31.119 --> 30:34.205
Y'all excuse me
just for one sec.

30:34.205 --> 30:36.207
- Jesus.

30:36.207 --> 30:37.542
- She knows.

30:37.542 --> 30:40.587
I don't think so.
- She does, and he told her.

30:40.587 --> 30:42.172
Okay, there's no possible way.

30:42.172 --> 30:44.007
That's what they do
in Marriage Encounter, okay?

30:44.007 --> 30:46.384
They share everything.

30:46.384 --> 30:49.387
- Look, I thought
it was wife swapping.

30:49.387 --> 30:51.973
- That's why it stopped,
'cause she knows.

30:51.973 --> 30:53.933
- No normal woman would come
to this house if she knew

30:53.933 --> 30:56.728
that you were sleeping
with her husband.

30:56.728 --> 30:58.146
- Was.

30:58.146 --> 31:00.607
He's canceled
our last two rendezvous.

31:02.609 --> 31:04.486
- Oh.

31:27.467 --> 31:30.261
- Candy said you got a new job.

31:30.261 --> 31:32.180
- Yeah, yeah.

31:35.308 --> 31:38.061
- Super Circuits?

31:38.061 --> 31:39.896
- Consumer Circuits.

31:42.315 --> 31:43.566
- I haven't heard of it.

31:45.068 --> 31:49.030
- Well, it's new,
so you wouldn't have.

31:54.661 --> 31:56.746
It's not without risks.

31:58.748 --> 32:00.583
But you only live once.

32:02.335 --> 32:03.795
And getting in
on the ground floor

32:03.795 --> 32:06.506
does have its advantages.

32:08.341 --> 32:10.093
Lots of upsides.

32:13.179 --> 32:15.140
- Yeah, I'd love be out there
cowboying it with you,

32:15.140 --> 32:18.643
but you know, TI just treats me
too damn good.

32:27.986 --> 32:29.988
- You're overworking your meat.

32:32.699 --> 32:37.036
It's first rule of grilling,
you only wanna flip 'em once.

32:42.667 --> 32:44.043
- So sweet.
- It's not for you.

32:44.043 --> 32:46.754
- Betty should try it on.
You should try it on.

32:46.754 --> 32:49.090
- I'm gonna check your bag
at the end of this thing.

32:49.090 --> 32:50.633
Oh, look.

32:50.633 --> 32:53.845
- Of course, somebody
had to be the practical one.

32:53.845 --> 32:55.471
That's perfect.

32:55.471 --> 32:58.391
- I will be thanking you for
this when I run out one night.

33:00.768 --> 33:02.562
Miss Candy,
can I use your phone?

33:02.562 --> 33:04.063
- Oh, sure,
it's in the kitchen.

33:04.063 --> 33:06.357
- Who are you calling
in the middle of a party?

33:06.357 --> 33:08.276
It's Jeffrey.
- Oh, come on.

33:08.276 --> 33:10.361
- I must confess.
I miss my husband.

33:10.361 --> 33:11.821
- Oh, Lord.

33:11.821 --> 33:14.157
- Go and call your man.
- She's serious.

33:14.157 --> 33:15.742
- Yeah.
- Oh, my goodness.

33:15.742 --> 33:19.037
- I would be calling Allan too
if he wasn't right outside.

33:19.037 --> 33:21.873
I like to keep him
where I can see him these days.

33:21.873 --> 33:23.416
- Well, Tom and I found out

33:23.416 --> 33:26.502
we get along a lot better
after a little time apart.

33:28.546 --> 33:29.589
And I mean come on,
y'all,

33:29.589 --> 33:30.757
you Marriage Encounter people,

33:30.757 --> 33:32.717
I mean, it is just
talk, talk, talk.

33:32.717 --> 33:36.179
- I can hear you.
- I-I know.

33:36.179 --> 33:40.642
- Well, you know, talking
can be very, um, energizing.

33:40.642 --> 33:41.851
Absolutely.

33:41.851 --> 33:43.728
It's so scary at first,

33:43.728 --> 33:48.608
but, um, once you really get
intimate with your husband,

33:48.608 --> 33:52.320
you would be shocked
at the untapped emotion

33:52.320 --> 33:54.155
that you have inside.

33:54.155 --> 33:58.701
Passion and tenderness, but...

34:00.370 --> 34:05.667
Also forgiveness
and acceptance.

34:05.667 --> 34:07.460
- It's very true.
- Amen.

34:09.337 --> 34:10.964
- What about a little thing
called privacy?

34:10.964 --> 34:13.841
Because honestly,
last thing I really want

34:13.841 --> 34:16.761
is to have Pat Montgomery
knowing everything I do

34:16.761 --> 34:19.055
and think every second
of the day.

34:19.055 --> 34:20.682
- Can I see you in the kitchen?

34:20.682 --> 34:22.642
Well,
that may work for you.

34:22.642 --> 34:25.561
But once Allan and I
got rid of all our secrets,

34:25.561 --> 34:27.939
our marriage
has never been better.

34:34.612 --> 34:37.156
- What happened?
- Nothing.

34:37.156 --> 34:38.449
- I-I was waiting for you.

34:46.541 --> 34:47.500
Um.

34:49.836 --> 34:55.174
Well, I am so touched
by your generosity,

34:55.174 --> 34:56.676
all of you.

34:56.676 --> 35:02.265
I haven't had friends like this
since I moved to Texas,

35:02.265 --> 35:04.475
so it means a lot.

35:06.060 --> 35:10.773
But, um, I wanted to say
something to Candy.

35:21.576 --> 35:24.537
The compassion and friendship
you've shown me

35:24.537 --> 35:26.664
over the past few months...

35:28.541 --> 35:30.501
Has touched me
in a very deep way.

35:32.462 --> 35:33.671
You've been there for me

35:33.671 --> 35:35.465
through some
really hard times...

35:37.508 --> 35:39.052
And I'll never forget it.

35:48.061 --> 35:51.022
Oh, thank you.

35:51.022 --> 35:52.440
You told her, didn't you?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.192
- Not here, please.

35:59.989 --> 36:02.116
- Did you tell her?

36:02.116 --> 36:03.576
- No.

36:07.038 --> 36:09.832
Who are you lying to?
Her or me?

36:09.832 --> 36:11.125
- I didn't tell her.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.460
- 'Cause I don't need her
going around

36:12.460 --> 36:14.921
using my life
as gossip to make friends.

36:16.881 --> 36:20.176
- The only affair that came out

36:20.176 --> 36:23.763
in Marriage Encounter
was Betty's.

36:23.763 --> 36:26.349
- Betty's?

36:26.349 --> 36:29.268
- Yes, a long time ago.

36:31.104 --> 36:33.940
Look, um,

36:33.940 --> 36:36.359
the Marriage Encounter, um,

36:36.359 --> 36:38.569
I think it's working.

36:38.569 --> 36:43.950
I mean, it's a lot of work,
and I think...

36:45.701 --> 36:48.287
I think I should probably
focus on that.

36:51.958 --> 36:55.044
- If it's working,
we should stop.

36:55.044 --> 36:56.754
That's kind of what
I was thinking.

36:58.589 --> 37:01.300
Things are better, I-I think.

37:04.262 --> 37:05.888
- For everyone.

37:14.731 --> 37:18.317
And thank you

37:18.317 --> 37:21.154
for being her friend, it--

37:21.154 --> 37:25.283
it means a lot to her,
and to both of us.

37:27.285 --> 37:28.619
- Of course.

38:01.611 --> 38:03.779
- Hey, Christina, you're just
in time for Parcheesi.

38:03.779 --> 38:05.907
Get in there.
Come in!

38:05.907 --> 38:07.366
- Hi, Candy.

38:07.366 --> 38:10.286
- Where is that baby?
- Oh, with Allan.

38:10.286 --> 38:14.081
I actually,
I have a few minutes.

38:14.081 --> 38:15.416
- Okay.

38:17.877 --> 38:19.295
- Oh, um...

38:21.797 --> 38:24.550
Did I do something wrong?

38:24.550 --> 38:27.386
I just feel like
we were so close.

38:27.386 --> 38:29.847
And I haven't heard
from you since the baby.

38:29.847 --> 38:32.892
- Oh, no, nothing's wrong.
I've just been so busy.

38:34.602 --> 38:36.145
- Good.

38:38.231 --> 38:40.066
But would you--

38:40.066 --> 38:41.901
I'm sorry, I've gotta get.

38:41.901 --> 38:43.819
When it comes to board games,
we don't screw around.

38:43.819 --> 38:45.154
Right.

38:45.154 --> 38:49.408
Okay, um, well, do you
wanna have lunch sometime?

38:49.408 --> 38:52.328
- Sure, see you soon. Bye.

38:57.708 --> 38:58.835
I won!

38:58.835 --> 39:00.211
Wait, we haven't even started.

39:00.211 --> 39:02.046
Where is the starting position?

39:03.297 --> 39:05.508
Before the game starts,
each player has to move

39:05.508 --> 39:10.012
all their four of their pawns
in the start area, that's here.

39:10.012 --> 39:11.514
No, that's the home.

39:11.514 --> 39:12.974
So you need to put them
in the start,

39:12.974 --> 39:14.475
which is over
in the corner there.

39:14.475 --> 39:18.354
So to enter a pawn, a five
must be thrown on the dice.

39:18.354 --> 39:21.607
Is that on one die--
- All right, who wants sundaes?

39:22.733 --> 39:24.151
Butterscotch!
Butterscotch!

39:24.151 --> 39:26.153
Are you seriously
gonna make sundaes?

39:26.153 --> 39:28.155
- Why not.
You're the best, Mom.

39:28.155 --> 39:29.824
- Yeah, she is.
Aww, thank you.

39:29.824 --> 39:33.244
Oh, shoot, that's Sherry.

39:33.244 --> 39:35.079
I totally forgot
about English class.

39:35.079 --> 39:36.122
No!

39:36.122 --> 39:37.331
Do we still got sundaes?

39:37.331 --> 39:38.666
- Yeah. Come on.
Let your mom have her fun.

39:38.666 --> 39:40.084
- No, it's-it's okay.

39:40.084 --> 39:41.586
I'll just tell her
I can't make it tonight.

39:41.586 --> 39:43.254
- Go--I'll take care
of the sundaes.

39:43.254 --> 39:44.672
You go to class.

39:46.465 --> 39:48.301
- Okay. Thanks, hon.

39:53.472 --> 39:55.182
- Oh, hey, hon, would you mind
throwing some fudge

39:55.182 --> 39:56.851
in the microwave
before you leave?

39:56.851 --> 39:58.185
Maybe chop up some peanuts?

40:00.354 --> 40:01.731
- Of course.

40:16.162 --> 40:17.830
What is in this bag?

40:21.375 --> 40:24.712
Candace Montgomery,
what in the world?

40:24.712 --> 40:27.340
- We are playing hooky.
We are?

40:27.340 --> 40:31.093
- Mm-hmm. Just drive.
Okay.

40:44.482 --> 40:46.484
- Love ring.
Mm-hmm.

40:48.945 --> 40:50.780
- I wonder who that was.

41:15.471 --> 41:20.184
We don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

41:20.184 --> 41:21.977
- Of course I want to.

41:23.145 --> 41:26.482
You always feel
better after, right?

41:26.482 --> 41:28.693
- I do.
Yeah.

41:38.119 --> 41:39.286
Okay.

42:53.444 --> 42:56.155
Yeah, baby.
Shake it, baby.

43:15.174 --> 43:16.801
- Bye.

44:07.434 --> 44:10.688
- How was class?

44:10.688 --> 44:12.481
- It was great.
