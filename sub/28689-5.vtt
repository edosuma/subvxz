02:13.215 --> 02:16.215
- The shipment's past Rome.
- Call me when it arrives.

03:09.135 --> 03:11.575
You're late, it's nearly over.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.733
I ran into traffic.

03:15.735 --> 03:18.213
In Heaven as it is on earth.

03:18.215 --> 03:21.653
Give us this day our daily bread,

03:21.655 --> 03:24.373
forgive us our trespasses

03:24.375 --> 03:27.533
as we give those
who trespass against us

03:27.535 --> 03:31.375
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

03:32.975 --> 03:36.933
Deliver us, Lord, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,

03:36.935 --> 03:39.533
that, by the help of your mercy,

03:39.535 --> 03:43.053
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,

03:43.055 --> 03:48.093
as we await the blessed hope and
the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

03:48.095 --> 03:52.453
For the kingdom, the power and the glory
are yours, now and for ever.

03:52.455 --> 03:55.013
The peace of the Lord
be with you always.

03:55.015 --> 03:56.653
And with your spirit.

03:56.655 --> 04:00.895
In the spirit of Christ risen,
exchange a sign of peace.

04:02.095 --> 04:04.295
Peace.

04:07.215 --> 04:09.655
Peace be with you.

04:12.575 --> 04:14.015
Peace.

05:17.095 --> 05:21.173
Good morning!
Good morning, Grandma!

05:21.175 --> 05:22.853
Everything all right?

05:22.855 --> 05:25.693
You grow more beautiful every day!
Cutie-pie.

05:25.695 --> 05:27.213
- Michelangelo!
- Aunty!

05:27.215 --> 05:30.253
- I made pasta for you.
- Do you remember Patrizia?

05:30.255 --> 05:32.333
- Of course!
- She's joining us today.

05:32.335 --> 05:34.093
I'll take care of it.

05:34.095 --> 05:36.333
Michelangelo,
come with me to buy dessert.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.853
- Wait, Ciccio.
- We'll be back in ten minutes.

05:38.855 --> 05:40.855
- Wait!
- Come with me.

05:41.855 --> 05:43.375
I'll be right back.

05:45.695 --> 05:48.173
Give them to me, I'll cut them.

05:48.175 --> 05:51.695
Donna Patrizia, give me your jacket.

06:00.255 --> 06:02.055
You don't know how to do it.

06:05.455 --> 06:08.493
I'll do it with mozzarella.

06:08.495 --> 06:12.215
- Can I help?
- There's no need, thank you.

06:25.055 --> 06:28.093
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

06:28.095 --> 06:31.215
In church I saw
you didn't take part in the prayer.

06:32.855 --> 06:34.335
Don't you have faith?

06:35.655 --> 06:39.213
I lost both my parents
when I was only 12 years old.

06:39.215 --> 06:43.333
I was left with my three-year-old
brother and two younger sisters.

06:43.335 --> 06:47.015
From then on, for me
the Almighty has only been a fantasy.

06:48.095 --> 06:52.535
The Almighty tests our faith
through pain.

07:00.935 --> 07:03.855
The priest who buried Mamma
said God is love.

07:05.415 --> 07:08.775
That's right, God is love.

08:05.175 --> 08:06.535
Nicola.

08:08.895 --> 08:10.895
Where are we meeting?

08:12.255 --> 08:14.695
Okay, got it, I'll come by later.

08:29.015 --> 08:30.855
Can I have a word?

08:38.455 --> 08:40.294
At your disposal.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.975
I raised my Michelangelo like a prince.

08:45.975 --> 08:50.493
I sent him to school,
he's educated.

08:50.495 --> 08:52.535
He speaks proper Italian.

08:53.535 --> 08:55.975
Michelangelo is special to me.

08:57.095 --> 09:00.973
He told us you're seeing
a lot of each other

09:00.975 --> 09:04.215
and for matters
that don't concern our business.

09:05.935 --> 09:09.093
You're the boss of Secondigliano
and we respect you,

09:09.095 --> 09:14.133
basically because the person
who put you there is one of us.

09:14.135 --> 09:18.095
But we don't want our blood
mixing with yours.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.733
If you please,

09:25.735 --> 09:27.575
let's go eat.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.215
I want to say something.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.613
If Patrizia is here,
there's a reason for it.

12:09.615 --> 12:12.413
- I want to tell you that she and I...
- What do you want to say?

12:12.415 --> 12:16.493
What does he want to say?
What's going on, Mickey?

12:16.495 --> 12:20.413
Nothing, absolutely nothing's going on.

12:20.415 --> 12:22.973
Don't worry, Donna Benedetta.

12:22.975 --> 12:26.533
If I'm here today it's because
a new shipment has arrived.

12:26.535 --> 12:30.373
If it's all right with you,
tonight we'll organize the delivery.

12:30.375 --> 12:34.095
- The sooner the better.
- Then that's settled.

12:35.535 --> 12:38.095
Thank you so much,
it was all delicious.

12:39.975 --> 12:41.815
But I have to go.

12:46.775 --> 12:49.373
- Why?
- Because it's only right.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.415
It's right for you, not for me!

12:52.655 --> 12:54.775
Mickey, wait a minute.

13:02.135 --> 13:03.895
Patrizia!

13:07.735 --> 13:09.735
Where are you going? Stop!

13:11.415 --> 13:14.413
- Stop! Get out.
- I haven't got time for this bullshit.

13:14.415 --> 13:18.335
Is it bullshit?
If it's bullshit run me down. Get out!

13:25.535 --> 13:28.893
I couldn't give a fuck
about what my family said.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.653
They're your blood.

13:31.655 --> 13:34.215
No one can go against their own blood.

13:35.535 --> 13:38.813
I learned that the hard way.

13:38.815 --> 13:41.215
That's just the way it is, Michelangelo.

15:48.255 --> 15:51.093
Guys, run! The cops!

15:51.095 --> 15:52.415
Tell the others!

15:59.735 --> 16:01.293
Lino!

16:01.295 --> 16:05.335
- Nicola!
- Lino, run!

16:12.335 --> 16:15.173
- The cops!
- Run!

16:15.175 --> 16:17.255
Get in!

16:20.535 --> 16:23.975
- Stop, police!
- Against the wall!

16:27.455 --> 16:29.255
Go!

16:42.375 --> 16:45.575
Don't move! Face on the ground!

17:30.775 --> 17:33.973
I don't know how it happened.

17:33.975 --> 17:37.013
The cops suddenly showed up.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.655
- Right, Lino?
- That's right.

17:47.055 --> 17:50.613
The guys are trusted soldiers,

17:50.615 --> 17:53.735
they've worked with us
on every shipment.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.535
What do you think of me, Nicola?

18:04.215 --> 18:07.095
I've demonstrated what I think of you
with my actions.

18:09.975 --> 18:13.693
This raid is a fucking big problem

18:13.695 --> 18:16.215
and takes priority over everything.

18:19.415 --> 18:21.373
What do we do?

18:21.375 --> 18:23.493
Call a meeting.

18:23.495 --> 18:27.535
I want the whole Alliance there,
I wanna see if one of them's involved.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.775
Donna Patrizia...

19:33.855 --> 19:37.175
They ripped off the drugs
we paid for upfront?

19:38.415 --> 19:41.693
The problem's not just the money
we paid upfront,

19:41.695 --> 19:47.453
if there's no drugs to sell,
the dealing will stop.

19:47.455 --> 19:49.895
The dealing won't stop.

19:51.415 --> 19:54.375
- We'll sell hashish, pills.
- Pills?

19:55.375 --> 19:58.653
- Are we 15?
- We all have to suffer.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.255
The time it takes for another shipment.

20:02.775 --> 20:04.775
So, tell me something.

20:07.935 --> 20:11.055
Who's going to pay
for this new shipment?

20:14.215 --> 20:17.893
This Alliance is based
on the rules we all agreed to.

20:17.895 --> 20:20.295
The shipment was my responsibility.

20:21.935 --> 20:24.653
I'll pay for it.

20:24.655 --> 20:26.855
And how long will it take?

20:29.135 --> 20:32.213
- A month.
- That seems too long.

20:32.215 --> 20:36.375
This raid was bad for all of us.

20:37.775 --> 20:39.895
For us the same as you.

20:42.735 --> 20:45.895
But if you give us what we lost
we'll be square.

20:47.535 --> 20:49.695
But a month means a month.

20:54.975 --> 20:56.735
You have my word.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.375
That's good enough for us.

21:03.935 --> 21:05.975
Good enough for us, too.

21:49.255 --> 21:51.133
You got a problem?

21:51.135 --> 21:54.693
Tell her we want
to talk to her, alone.

21:54.695 --> 21:56.415
All good.

22:16.895 --> 22:19.213
They're not happy?

22:19.215 --> 22:22.893
They want to talk to you
without people around.

22:22.895 --> 22:25.255
We gotta take 'em out straightaway.

22:28.215 --> 22:30.775
I'll decide what we do.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.518
Good morning.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.998
- Hello, Donna Patrizia.
- Good morning.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.120
Well? What do we need to talk about?

23:07.760 --> 23:10.078
What you said doesn't sit right with us.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.438
Till yesterday
the Forcella guys were small fry.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.958
The Levantes have a finger in every
fucking pie, government contracts...

23:15.960 --> 23:17.918
Drugs are chump change for them.

23:17.920 --> 23:22.398
But we live off drugs
and we can't afford to lose a month.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.480
We found another channel.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.200
We all get coke through
the same channel, that's the deal.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.758
Or am I wrong?

23:36.760 --> 23:40.640
You're not wrong
but our people are starving.

23:42.320 --> 23:46.518
And if they turn on us there won't be
any more deals with anyone.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.478
You understand...

23:48.480 --> 23:51.558
I understand that you're being
disrespectful to me.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.078
You can understand what you want,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.440
but you have to give us our money now.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.278
We'll wait until next Sunday.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.920
You have one week,
then we'll go through other channels.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.240
That's it, then.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.120
50 thousand.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.520
We're 500 thousand short.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.240
- Have we looked everywhere?
- There's nothing left.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.160
Go away.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.360
I said go away!

27:59.240 --> 28:02.720
You know what I'm doing
and what the drug money is for.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.560
I put you in Secondigliano so
I didn't have to bother about this shit.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.840
I don't know who,
but someone wants to screw me.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.720
What did you expect?

28:27.680 --> 28:29.960
This is what it means to be a boss.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.560
This is our life.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.480
Few friends and snakes everywhere.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.520
The Capaccios can't wait
to break this alliance

28:57.840 --> 29:00.758
and I can't afford
any trouble right now.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.840
We have to do what they want.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.000
I'll give you the money for
the shipment, but it's the last time.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.080
Thank you, Gennaro.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.360
Patrizia...

29:32.200 --> 29:34.360
Bring me the name of who did it.

29:59.880 --> 30:03.038
What are you doing here?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.838
Don Michelangelo Levante's inside,

30:05.840 --> 30:07.960
he says he wants to talk to you.

30:31.960 --> 30:36.798
- What do you want?
- I heard you have a problem.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.958
- I want to help you.
- I don't need it.

30:40.960 --> 30:44.838
Go home, or your father will be worried.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.520
Still on about my father?

30:48.800 --> 30:53.238
You know what I think? The problem's
not the crap my father says.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.398
- What is it, then?
- You don't have any balls.

30:56.400 --> 31:01.158
I'm tired, I can't even listen to you.
Let go of me.

31:01.160 --> 31:06.838
I went against my whole family for you.
I'm still here.

31:06.840 --> 31:09.598
And what did you do?

31:09.600 --> 31:11.520
You ran away.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.720
You know what I think, how I feel.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.200
You know all too well.

31:21.200 --> 31:24.558
But this is the last time I'm saying it.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.240
If you want me, you make the next move.

31:53.880 --> 31:55.838
Well?

31:55.840 --> 31:58.478
Have you taken care of that matter?

31:58.480 --> 32:01.840
Alberto, maybe I wasn't clear,
I need this money now.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.920
And I mean now.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.720
Don't worry, we'll fix it all up later.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.600
All right.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.280
What's going on?

32:37.800 --> 32:40.518
Nothing, baby, it's all good.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.198
You said that in London, too.

32:43.200 --> 32:46.118
It's always all good.

32:46.120 --> 32:51.838
Gennaro...
we made a promise, you and me,

32:51.840 --> 32:54.240
that we're always together in this.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.318
It's better
if I'm on my own for certain things.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.800
Don't treat me like I'm dumb!

33:20.200 --> 33:22.600
They fucked off with the shipment, okay?

33:25.000 --> 33:28.358
And I have to fix it
or else the peace is gone.

33:28.360 --> 33:32.318
And we can flush everything
we've done down the shitter!

33:32.320 --> 33:34.878
Who told you? Patrizia?

33:34.880 --> 33:38.318
Was it her calling you?
Why didn't you tell me, asshole?

33:38.320 --> 33:40.838
What the fuck's that got to do with it?

33:40.840 --> 33:44.520
I gotta help her and I gotta do it
for us, you know that!

33:46.120 --> 33:47.800
I know.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.400
But I'm with you.

33:52.760 --> 33:57.320
And you mustn't hide
anything from me anymore.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.520
What you're looking for is in there.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.840
But it's not a gift.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.078
I know it's not a gift.

35:44.080 --> 35:46.760
Tell Gennaro I'll give it back
in two months.

35:50.960 --> 35:54.200
You used to work in a place like this,
didn't you?

36:03.400 --> 36:05.798
Patrizia...

36:05.800 --> 36:09.038
I wanted to tell you personally

36:09.040 --> 36:12.040
how far this collaboration is taking us.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.400
That's very important.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.640
Me and Gennaro still
have a lot of faith in you.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.960
And I paid a heavy price to earn it.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.600
That's true.

36:31.680 --> 36:34.718
You've done a lot for us.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.040
And I won't forget it.

36:49.880 --> 36:53.200
But don't think you're the only one
who's lost something.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.320
Don't worry.

37:05.480 --> 37:08.080
I won't forget it.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.640
You can go now.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.958
Take it to them now.

37:49.960 --> 37:53.838
Tell the Capaccios
they got what they asked for.

37:53.840 --> 37:56.678
You want us to come with you?

37:56.680 --> 37:59.760
No, I need to sort something out
on my own.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.600
Donna Patrizia, good evening.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.880
To what do we owe the pleasure
of this unexpected visit?

38:32.640 --> 38:34.798
Care to come in? A drink perhaps?

38:34.800 --> 38:36.840
Don't bother, Papa.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.320
I just want to say something.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.400
Go ahead.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.838
The other day you said something to me

38:52.840 --> 38:54.920
and I didn't say anything back.

38:56.440 --> 38:59.000
Maybe you think I ran away.

39:00.240 --> 39:04.960
If you do, you're wrong.
What you said offended me.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.920
And that's no good.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.278
On the other hand, as you know,

39:15.280 --> 39:18.318
the basis for respect is sincerity.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.000
Or am I wrong?

39:23.120 --> 39:25.320
You're not wrong.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.358
Then there's something
you need to know.

39:28.360 --> 39:31.720
The problem isn't whether or not
I'm right for your son.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.880
We've already made our choice.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.080
The problem is you.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.200
We're serious about each other.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.198
Is that all?

40:09.200 --> 40:10.800
That's all.
