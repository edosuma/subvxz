00:01.802 --> 00:03.737
( distorted techno intro )

00:11.345 --> 00:13.381
( heavy electronic beat )

00:23.124 --> 00:25.093
* Hey, hey, hey *

00:25.126 --> 00:26.460
* I'm the trouble starter

00:26.494 --> 00:28.429
* I'm the instigator

00:31.632 --> 00:33.401
* I'm the fear addicted

00:33.434 --> 00:36.704
* And agent illustrated

00:36.737 --> 00:38.339
* Hey, hey, hey *

00:38.372 --> 00:39.807
* I'm a fire starter

00:39.840 --> 00:42.310
* Twisted fire starter

00:43.511 --> 00:45.113
* Hey, hey, hey *

00:45.146 --> 00:47.115
* You're the fire starter

00:47.148 --> 00:50.084
* Twisted fire starter

00:50.118 --> 00:51.385
* Hey, hey, hey *

00:51.419 --> 00:53.454
* I'm a fire starter

00:53.487 --> 00:55.456
* Twisted fire starter

01:02.163 --> 01:03.864
* I'm the bitch you hated

01:03.897 --> 01:06.234
* Filth infatuated

01:06.267 --> 01:08.502
* Yeah

01:08.536 --> 01:10.104
* I'm the pipe you tasted

01:10.138 --> 01:13.807
* Then intoxicated

01:13.841 --> 01:15.643
* Hey, hey, hey *

01:15.676 --> 01:19.079
* I'm a fire starter,
twisted fire starter... *

01:21.415 --> 01:24.585
( explosion,
car alarms beeping )

01:35.896 --> 01:37.498
Damn it.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.270
( car alarms blaring )

01:42.303 --> 01:44.738
( explosion,
car alarms blaring )

01:49.677 --> 01:52.112
( sirens blaring )

02:00.621 --> 02:01.722
What do you say, Colby?

02:01.755 --> 02:04.258
Hey, Don.

02:04.292 --> 02:07.495
Friends from the Earth
Liberation Movement again, huh?

02:07.528 --> 02:08.629
Yup. So, this makes

02:08.662 --> 02:10.431
for the fourth eco fire.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.732
You tell how you're
gonna save the world

02:11.765 --> 02:14.468
by burning down
an SUV dealership, you know?

02:14.502 --> 02:17.271
Yeah, well, all I can tell you
is, we got a guy over here

02:17.305 --> 02:19.273
who's not gonna be
around to enjoy the fresh air.

02:19.307 --> 02:22.476
Sean Grasso. He's 32,
junior salesman.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.577
The owner says he thinks

02:23.611 --> 02:26.214
he probably came in here early
to do his paperwork.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.881
Notify the family?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.950
Yeah, Megan talked to his wife.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.719
Evidently,
they have a four-month old.

02:31.752 --> 02:32.720
-Don. Hey.
-Hey.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.721
I got your message.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.191
Yeah. You-You didn't have
to come down, buddy.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.193
Aah. Um, four fires
doesn't provide enough data

02:39.227 --> 02:40.661
to create a hot zone, so
I thought... I thought

02:40.694 --> 02:42.396
there might be something
else here I can work with.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.597
Oh, come here.

02:43.631 --> 02:44.665
It's really not much, Charlie.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.500
It's just the burned out SUV
and this booth here.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.901
-Hey, Paul. Let me see.
-MAN: Don.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.370
-How's it going?
-All right.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.671
-Hey. Colby.
-Paul.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.374
Hi. I'm Charles Eppes.
I'm a FBI consultant.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.908
Paul Stevens.
LAFD Arson Investigator.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.277
Are you an arson expert?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.478
I'm a mathematician.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.412
You might be wondering

02:58.446 --> 02:59.913
what I'm doing
at the scene of an arson.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.549
Hey, makes sense to me.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.551
I mean, I-I've got arson books

03:03.584 --> 03:04.685
full of equations.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.420
Open and contained
flame calculators,

03:06.454 --> 03:08.356
uh, flow rates for oxygen...

03:08.389 --> 03:10.358
Well, the-the study
of combustion is based largely

03:10.391 --> 03:11.559
on fluid mechanics.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.960
You know, there's some
amazing work done

03:12.993 --> 03:15.229
by Prandtl and Euler, Smits...

03:15.263 --> 03:17.498
Equations are in the
books, not that in here.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.966
Mostly I work
with physical indicators--

03:18.999 --> 03:20.668
scorch marks,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.970
ignition devices,
burn patterns.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.305
Trying to build a signature.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.773
Arsonist's M.O.,
that kind of thing.

03:25.806 --> 03:26.774
( garbled radio transmission )

03:26.807 --> 03:29.710
So, anything?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.512
Yeah. The, uh, SUV went up

03:31.545 --> 03:33.581
-with a Molotov cocktail.
-Mm-hmm.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.682
That's the same
as all the other fires.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.250
And the security booth here?

03:36.284 --> 03:37.385
Cigarette and a book of matches.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.652
Classic, old-school igniter.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.820
Why bother with the booth?

03:39.853 --> 03:40.921
Well, there's a phone inside.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.923
Probably wanted to make sure
no one called for help.

03:42.956 --> 03:43.924
COLBY:
Only the salesman

03:43.957 --> 03:46.394
shows up early and tries to make
a call anyway.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.728
Opens the door,
influx of oxygen--

03:47.761 --> 03:49.263
creates a back draft.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.364
I mean, people

03:50.398 --> 03:52.566
underestimate the power
of a fire, even a small one.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.501
You know?

03:53.534 --> 03:54.602
What do you suggest we do
at this point?

03:54.635 --> 03:58.672
Trying to catch an arsonist
by his signature is like

03:58.706 --> 04:01.342
trying to identify someone
by their shadow. I mean...

04:01.375 --> 04:03.010
I might be able to come up
with a lot more if I can borrow

04:03.043 --> 04:04.612
your, uh,
professor here.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.480
Yeah, I mean, it's fine
with me, go for it.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.681
Sure. It's my pleasure.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.849
-Can I see what you're
working with? -Sure.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.351
COLBY:
You know, in Colorado,

04:10.384 --> 04:12.486
these guys eventually
destroyed a ski resort.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.821
They left a
banner that said,

04:13.854 --> 04:15.789
"If you build it, the
E-L-M will burn it."

04:15.823 --> 04:17.658
You know what was really
concerning me is that

04:17.691 --> 04:19.627
with each fire,
they get more aggressive.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.336
We all use math every day,

04:28.369 --> 04:30.404
to predict weather,

04:30.438 --> 04:31.972
to tell time,

04:32.005 --> 04:34.842
to handle money.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.681
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

04:40.714 --> 04:44.084
It's logic...

04:44.117 --> 04:46.787
it's rationality.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.689
It's using your mind

04:48.722 --> 04:50.658
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.601
"There is no more open door

05:00.634 --> 05:03.571
"by which one can enter
the study of natural science

05:03.604 --> 05:07.074
than by considering
the phenomena of a candle."

05:09.510 --> 05:10.844
Faraday said that.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.513
Faraday?

05:12.546 --> 05:14.782
I wonder if Faraday
ever used his insights

05:14.815 --> 05:16.484
to crack an arson case.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.851
Oh, do my sensors

05:17.885 --> 05:19.353
detect frustration?

05:19.387 --> 05:20.721
Yes, your sensors are correct.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.924
Arson investigations
consider seven points of data--

05:23.957 --> 05:24.992
fuel, burn rate,

05:25.025 --> 05:27.495
scorch marks, smoke patterns,

05:27.528 --> 05:29.897
flame temperature,
igniter, and, uh,

05:29.930 --> 05:34.602
oh, point of origin-- to create
what's called a fire signature.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.836
Oh, seven points.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.639
You know, this sounds less
like a signature,

05:38.672 --> 05:39.940
more like a fingerprint.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.475
Well, see,
but that's-that's just it.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.676
It's not like a fingerprint.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.578
Arson signatures are not nearly
as accurate,

05:44.612 --> 05:45.579
nor are they as specific.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.015
I need more parameters.
Everything that gives

05:48.048 --> 05:49.149
a fire its specific character.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.618
All right.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.152
What's to be done here?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.186
Well, I've already started

05:53.220 --> 05:55.155
by breaking down the initial
seven data points

05:55.188 --> 05:57.758
into several subsets, although,
I'm sure there's more

05:57.791 --> 05:58.892
to follow.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.060
Do you realize

06:00.093 --> 06:02.029
that if every vehicle
in this nation

06:02.062 --> 06:05.533
averaged just 2.7 more
miles per gallon,

06:05.566 --> 06:08.068
we could cut our dependency
on Mideast oil?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.637
Are you seriously trying

06:09.670 --> 06:11.639
to justify the arsonist's
motive?

06:11.672 --> 06:13.006
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hear me out.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.908
I'm merely making the point

06:14.942 --> 06:17.511
that the E-L-M's goals
are ecological.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.179
They're not pathological.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.814
Larry, I'm not really interested

06:20.848 --> 06:22.816
in the social significance
of these fires.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.984
Well, you should be, Charles.

06:24.017 --> 06:24.818
No, I shouldn't be, actually.

06:24.852 --> 06:25.953
Yes, you should be.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.521
Listen to me here.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.190
As fire destroys,
it also creates.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.093
And not just heat or light,

06:33.126 --> 06:36.063
but a solid product.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.665
-Soot?
-Soot.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.066
And the soot created

06:39.099 --> 06:41.068
within that fire is what
gives the flame its color.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.670
Something you can't even see,

06:42.703 --> 06:43.837
and yet it defines

06:43.871 --> 06:45.806
its entire nature.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.707
Larry.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.941
Charles.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.142
All due respect, I don't get it.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.111
This most recent fire claimed
a life.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.513
The others didn't.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.085
Intent.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.219
Keep going.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.621
Intent and...

07:00.654 --> 07:03.023
Intent and result.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.093
If each arsonist
approaches a fire differently,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.562
then it... then it makes sense
that every fire set...

07:08.596 --> 07:09.830
Would be as unique

07:09.863 --> 07:11.131
as the person setting it.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.635
And not just in terms
of the method used,

07:14.668 --> 07:17.237
but in terms
of-of the entire

07:17.270 --> 07:20.908
character of that fire.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.110
So, what you're talking about
really is like a, um...

07:23.143 --> 07:25.679
like a fingerprint for fires.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.582
A "fireprint."

07:35.155 --> 07:36.256
That's ridiculous.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.259
Why would the E-L-M waste
our efforts on an SUV lot?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.929
Gas prices and common sense are
gonna do that work for us.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.263
Your group's connected

07:43.296 --> 07:44.732
to acts of sabotage

07:44.765 --> 07:47.167
against construction
sites, and lumber mills,

07:47.200 --> 07:48.536
and oil wells...

07:48.569 --> 07:49.870
And has acknowledged
every single one.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.004
The Earth
Liberation Movement

07:51.038 --> 07:52.139
has no involvement
in these fires,

07:52.172 --> 07:53.006
and we've repeatedly said so.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.875
COLBY: So, tell me again
then why it is

07:54.908 --> 07:56.143
that your logo
is spray painted

07:56.176 --> 07:57.678
at all four of the crime scenes?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.179
Anyone can put three letters
on a wall.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.515
Even an FBI agent.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.150
MAN:
We've condemned the arsons,

08:03.183 --> 08:04.818
we've cooperated with
your investigation.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.153
MEGAN
Actually, you haven't.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.888
We asked you for
your membership roster,

08:07.921 --> 08:09.289
and you took us to court.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.659
We're a national organization
with 200 active members

08:11.692 --> 08:13.627
and ten times that number
of associates.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.062
We can't let you
randomly harass us.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.031
A homicide investigation
is not random harassment.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.633
WOMAN:
The FBI has a history

08:19.667 --> 08:22.035
of undermining
legitimate protest.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.104
Congress of Racial Equality,

08:24.137 --> 08:25.806
Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.775
American Indian Movement.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.009
That was the 1960s.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.311
Do me a favor
and check a calendar.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.213
The fires are intended
to discredit us.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.582
In my book,

08:34.615 --> 08:35.916
that makes you people
the suspects.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.052
I mean, it's
possible

08:39.086 --> 08:41.254
someone could be using
their logo to throw us, right?

08:41.288 --> 08:44.592
Maybe in one fire.
But four?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.093
Yeah? So?

08:46.126 --> 08:49.797
Well, the E-L-M isn't exactly
a monolithic organization.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.198
Kids float in and float out.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.800
All right, we just keep
busting their soldiers,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.668
and they'll just
keep recruiting more.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.905
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.708
Oh, where did you get that?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.242
E-L-M office.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.877
I'm positive I've seen that guy
in the middle before.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.847
You stole this picture?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.849
Well, it must have fallen off
the bulletin board

09:08.882 --> 09:10.350
and gotten stuck to my shoe.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.685
DON:
Got to do what you got to do,

09:11.719 --> 09:12.853
right?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.154
( beeps )

09:14.187 --> 09:15.222
Wait a minute.
You just see that?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.090
Look at that hat.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.626
MEGAN:
LA Center College.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.093
Yeah, there's probably only
a few thousand kids

09:20.127 --> 09:21.261
with that hat on.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.030
COLBY:
Yeah. But hold on. Look at this.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.033
Right there.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.901
How many of those show up
at two different fires?

09:27.935 --> 09:29.603
MEGAN:
90 percent of all

09:29.637 --> 09:31.104
E-L-M activists
are college students.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.372
They're all young,

09:32.405 --> 09:33.707
white and male.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.307
COLBY:
Yeah, but look at that.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.909
That's a good match.

09:35.943 --> 09:36.844
DON:
Yeah, I agree.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.712
All right, so we got
a face and a school.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.947
We just need a student ID match.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.361
Ah, college.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.899
Here it is-- Room B.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.267
Hey, wait a minute.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.835
Door's open.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.871
Yeah, but anything
we find can be subject

10:03.904 --> 10:06.039
to a challenge in court.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.909
Why don't we try
and just break one law a day?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.144
( headphones playing loudly )

10:11.178 --> 10:12.946
* You kicked me in the head

10:12.980 --> 10:16.216
* When I'm on the ground

10:16.249 --> 10:20.888
* Stop dragging me down

10:20.921 --> 10:22.355
* Stop dragging me down...

10:22.389 --> 10:24.291
Hi, I'm trying to find
Jake Eckworth.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.027
Can you tell me
where I might find him?

10:27.060 --> 10:30.097
Uh, Jake's my roommate, but he
doesn't tell me where he goes.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.965
Do you mind if we take a look
around your room?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.343
So, is Jake a geography major?

10:43.376 --> 10:44.411
World history.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.913
What are you studying?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.214
Engineering.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.415
Oh. Cool.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.052
You're not going to find
anything.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.286
He nukes the history.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.187
COLBY:
Really?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.756
And how do we know that?

10:55.789 --> 10:58.325
Well, because they're probably
good friends, Granger.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.927
I'm sure he uses
your laptop,

10:59.960 --> 11:01.061
sometimes, right?

11:01.094 --> 11:02.429
Sometimes, yeah.

11:03.831 --> 11:04.932
You know, you should really wait

11:04.965 --> 11:05.999
until Jake gets back.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.068
Hold on a second, you said
he deletes the history,

11:08.101 --> 11:10.771
so what if I run
a system restore.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.073
You're going to mess up
his software.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.341
Just use
the hard drive trace.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.176
You can backdoor it
from the desktop,

11:16.209 --> 11:18.311
instead of trying to drop
through the C drive.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.279
( computer beeping )

11:22.916 --> 11:25.085
COLBY:
"E-L-M.com."

11:25.118 --> 11:27.220
"Glendale Chamber
of Commerce?"

11:27.254 --> 11:27.888
MEGAN:
There's some notations

11:27.921 --> 11:29.056
on the map
around Glendale.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.023
Yeah.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.326
Look at this:
"Verdugo Ridge,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.361
Glendale, California."

11:34.394 --> 11:36.096
"Private, luxury
living space,

11:36.129 --> 11:37.931
opening fall 2006."

11:37.965 --> 11:39.432
This could be our guy.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.234
100 units being built
on mountain habitat.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.136
Well, that fits the profile

11:43.170 --> 11:44.137
for an E-L-M target,

11:44.171 --> 11:45.138
doesn't it?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.207
It certainly does.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.175
Thank you.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.817
It's pretty up here.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.488
That's his car,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.123
that blue Honda.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.291
Yeah, I see it.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.492
Colby, we go his car,
you ready?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.995
COLBY ( over radio ):
We're on the access road.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.997
He leaves,
he has to come past us.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.198
All right. We're moving.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.242
You guys take this side.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.411
( creaking )

13:04.985 --> 13:06.319
Jake, FBI-- don't move.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.420
Jake, wait!

13:17.530 --> 13:19.532
Jake? Jake!

13:21.001 --> 13:22.035
Colby, he's coming
your way.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.170
COLBY:
Copy that, Don!

13:28.976 --> 13:31.478
FBI! Freeze!

13:31.511 --> 13:33.947
Freeze! Drop the bag!

13:33.981 --> 13:34.481
Get your hands up.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.148
Get them up!

13:37.517 --> 13:39.152
I haven't done anything.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.055
Wow...

13:42.089 --> 13:44.124
cigarettes, lighter,
spray paint.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.458
Thought you guys

13:45.492 --> 13:46.526
were all about clean air.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.102
I didn't set any fires.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.069
Really?

13:56.103 --> 13:57.170
Cause the local news

13:57.204 --> 13:59.106
puts you at two E-L-M fires

13:59.139 --> 14:00.107
in the past three weeks.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.342
E-L-M is being set up.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.077
What, Jake,
you don't want credit?

14:04.111 --> 14:05.578
Why's that,
cause someone's dead now?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.579
E-L-M events are
carefully planned

14:06.613 --> 14:07.915
to protect human life.

14:07.948 --> 14:08.916
MEGAN:
Yeah, but then...

14:08.949 --> 14:10.350
accidents happen, right?

14:10.383 --> 14:13.453
DON:
What are you doing here, Jake?

14:13.486 --> 14:14.888
I'm just meeting a friend.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.289
MEGAN: Really?
Because your roommate says

14:16.323 --> 14:17.124
you've been
coming up here a lot.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.527
Who's that, Ethan?

14:20.560 --> 14:22.195
Ethan's a wannabe,
he doesn't know anything.

14:22.229 --> 14:22.896
Who's your friend?

14:24.631 --> 14:26.199
Just a concerned citizen.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.334
MEGAN:
Concerned with what, Jake?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.937
Setting fires in Glendale?

14:29.970 --> 14:30.938
Oceans can absorb

14:30.971 --> 14:32.039
two gigatons of carbon yearly.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.941
We're putting four times that
into the atmosphere

14:33.974 --> 14:34.942
with developments like this.

14:34.975 --> 14:35.909
How about this guy?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.345
How much carbon you put
in the atmosphere

14:38.378 --> 14:40.247
burning a 32-year-old father?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.248
Why don't you take
a good look at that.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.249
Go ahead. Hmm?

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
No?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.554
My only involvement
with the E-L-M

14:47.587 --> 14:49.356
is to forward information
to the media.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.091
I'm not, and have
never been, involved

14:51.124 --> 14:52.225
in any illegal activity.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.226
I am aware that you
can't hold me here

14:53.260 --> 14:54.127
without evidence.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.562
So, either release
or get me a lawyer.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.270
Kid knew exactly
what to say.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.637
Yeah, well,
I used to be smarter

15:04.671 --> 15:05.438
than everybody else, too.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.474
Yeah, arrogance fits
the profile

15:07.507 --> 15:09.977
of a political arsonist
perfectly.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.511
Well, we definitely
don't have enough to hold him.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.512
So, we're letting him go?

15:12.545 --> 15:15.215
No, we'll put him
under tight surveillance,

15:15.248 --> 15:17.250
which will at least keep him
from lighting another fire.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.952
All right. I'll check his phone
records and credit cards.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.120
Try and connect a few dots.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.254
I think the roommate

15:21.288 --> 15:23.156
knows more than
we got out of him.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.958
Yeah, if he hears Jake
bad-mouthed him,

15:24.992 --> 15:26.259
might be a little more

15:26.293 --> 15:27.627
forthcoming, too.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.662
CHARLIE:
So, were you able to determine

15:29.696 --> 15:31.531
what caused
the booth to explode?

15:31.564 --> 15:32.532
Like I thought: back draft.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.701
The igniter was shoved
under a seat cushion,

15:34.734 --> 15:36.636
creating a high level
of heat in the booth.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.637
Limited oxygen.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.638
Door opens and "boom."

15:38.671 --> 15:39.872
So, let me get this straight.

15:39.906 --> 15:44.077
The arsonist throws a Molotov
cocktail to start one fire,

15:44.111 --> 15:45.178
but not the other.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.113
Molotov cocktails are tricky.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.115
I mean, if you want
a structure to burn,

15:48.148 --> 15:49.449
a simple fuse ignition
source is easier.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.717
Gives a better shot at success.

15:50.750 --> 15:55.022
Well, right now I'm working on
a principled components analysis

15:55.055 --> 15:57.290
to give us a more accurate
arson signature.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.659
Well, great, but how do you do
that with seven data points?

15:59.692 --> 16:00.560
Oh, no,

16:00.593 --> 16:02.429
Charles is considering using
over 600.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.130
Six hundred?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.164
CHARLIE:
Well, you're looking

16:04.197 --> 16:05.298
at rate of heat,

16:05.332 --> 16:06.666
time span and weather, right?

16:06.699 --> 16:07.367
Yeah, that's right.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.136
Right, so I'm just calculating

16:09.169 --> 16:11.704
you know, heat absorption,
the rate of fuel burn,

16:11.738 --> 16:13.140
and the torching index.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.607
That's a little beyond
what we're capable of

16:14.641 --> 16:16.309
in the fire department,
I'll tell you that.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.546
Can I also see all the arson
records for L.A. County

16:19.579 --> 16:21.981
that you have access to
for, like, the past year?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.185
That's several thousand fires.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.054
Mm, that's
a pretty limited sample.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.321
You know what?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.090
Make it the past two years.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.425
Okay.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.394
MEGAN:
He's a 17-year-old sophomore.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.428
And I did some checking.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.529
He published a paper

16:36.563 --> 16:39.099
in the International Journal
of Civil Engineering.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.134
Oh, at 17, that's impressive.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.135
Yeah.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.104
I, uh, want you
to talk to him,

16:44.137 --> 16:47.107
see if you could get me
some insight on him.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.076
That's your field,
Agent Reeves.

16:49.109 --> 16:53.246
Yeah, but he's a young genius
in college with older kids,

16:53.280 --> 16:54.614
so I'm guessing
he's feeling some of

16:54.647 --> 16:57.117
the same social pressures
you did.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.186
I'm looking for
a button to push.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.721
Are these seats taken?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.228
I don't have anything
to say to you.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.229
What's the matter?

17:09.262 --> 17:10.763
You told Jake I spoke to you.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.100
Yeah, but I didn't tell him
anything you said.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.635
Who's this?

17:15.668 --> 17:17.537
A friend.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.172
Ethan, Jake's headed for a fall,

17:19.206 --> 17:20.307
and he's not the kind of guy
you want to be near

17:20.340 --> 17:21.241
when he goes down.

17:21.274 --> 17:24.244
Let me guess-- prom queen?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.245
Cheerleader?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.579
Excuse me?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.216
You don't know what it's like.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.085
The ones that don't ignore me

17:32.119 --> 17:33.253
make me feel like a freak.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.387
Scared of you...

17:34.421 --> 17:37.657
because they'll never catch up
to you in the classroom.

17:37.690 --> 17:42.129
Only talking to you
when they want your help.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.264
And when they do
let you sit with them,

17:44.297 --> 17:46.433
they have conversations
that go over your head,

17:46.466 --> 17:48.235
and nothing's supposed to go
over your head.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.838
Jake talks to you.

17:51.871 --> 17:56.343
You wonder if he's the first
and last person who ever will.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.814
Jake says he's innocent.

18:01.848 --> 18:02.615
Well, okay.

18:02.649 --> 18:05.718
Well, the best way
to prove that is

18:05.752 --> 18:06.753
to help Agent Reeves.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.655
Help her get to the truth.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.359
You don't understand.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.094
May I?

18:19.266 --> 18:23.570
C sub h = NA sub 1
plus MA sub 2 where N = M.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.873
Single wall carbon nanotubes.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.375
Potential applications

18:28.408 --> 18:32.279
include artificial muscles,
combat jackets...

18:32.312 --> 18:33.313
and a space elevator.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.317
I understand.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.322
What do you want?

18:42.355 --> 18:43.690
I want the name of the person

18:43.723 --> 18:45.292
that Jake was meeting
in Glendale.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.364
He has these friends
from Oregon.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.933
He talks to them online.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.867
I have to go.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.508
I guess it does
pays off sometimes

19:01.541 --> 19:03.576
to be a know-it-all.

19:06.246 --> 19:09.182
A back draft is
a fascinating phenomena.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.783
We can demonstrate it
with this candle.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.786
It's also called
a smoke explosion.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.955
The flame causes
the hot gases

19:15.988 --> 19:19.492
rising from the candle to...

19:19.526 --> 19:20.493
reignite.

19:20.527 --> 19:21.361
Somehow I missed the fact

19:21.394 --> 19:23.396
that the CalSci
Engineering Department

19:23.430 --> 19:24.697
had a combustion lab.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.898
It's pretty neat, huh?

19:25.932 --> 19:28.435
We converted it from
an old laundry room.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.502
Well, thank you,
Professor Waldie,

19:29.536 --> 19:30.703
for setting
this whole thing up.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.239
"Bill," please,

19:32.272 --> 19:33.606
and you don't have
to thank me.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.508
Creating the conditions
for a back draft,

19:35.542 --> 19:38.511
that's just way cool.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.913
Well, here's our booth.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.782
And, as noted
in the arson report, we have:

19:42.815 --> 19:44.417
insulated compartment,

19:44.451 --> 19:46.253
combustible ceiling.

19:46.286 --> 19:50.390
Now, this geometry will
starve the fire just enough

19:50.423 --> 19:51.458
so that when
this door is opened,

19:51.491 --> 19:52.792
oxygen will rush inside,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.661
creating a gravity current

19:54.694 --> 19:57.930
of cold air
and hot gases and, boom,

19:57.964 --> 19:59.799
smoke explosion, aka,

19:59.832 --> 20:01.334
a back draft.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.002
All we need is the heat source.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.003
Yeah.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.805
That would be me.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.275
I thought we could use

20:08.308 --> 20:09.642
the same brand

20:09.676 --> 20:11.278
that the arson
investigator found.

20:11.311 --> 20:13.546
And you're ready to go.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.681
Where'd you get a cigarette?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.616
I know a guy.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.552
Okay. So.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.688
Stevens said that
the arsonist probably

20:21.721 --> 20:23.856
placed the igniter
near some fuel,

20:23.890 --> 20:24.891
like a seat cushion.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.526
Mm-hmm.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.695
This type of foam is
an excellent

20:28.728 --> 20:30.297
hydrocarbon-based fuel.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.336
Okay.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.675
( lights match )

21:05.832 --> 21:07.467
Temperature's rising.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.502
When the temperature inside
reaches 600 degrees,

21:09.536 --> 21:10.670
we'll open the door

21:10.703 --> 21:13.340
and add oxygen.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.474
Okay, well.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.509
If the scorch marks and flame
indicators were recorded

21:16.543 --> 21:18.878
correctly for
a 5:41 AM start time,

21:18.911 --> 21:22.949
then wind and outside pressure
are a check.

21:22.982 --> 21:27.854
And at 600 degrees we should be
good to go on a back draft.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.424
We're almost there.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.868
Easy.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.077
Huh.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.849
Did we ventilate
the booth properly?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.851
According to my
calculations, yeah, we did.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.721
Heat release, burn rate,
air, time.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.922
There's no error

22:02.955 --> 22:03.856
in your math.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.691
No, no.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.326
That's a statement,
not a question.

22:09.095 --> 22:14.934
The booth fire couldn't have
been caused by a back draft.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.937
All right, so if it wasn't
a back draft, then what was it?

22:17.970 --> 22:20.807
Given the speed of
the flame, the heat,

22:20.840 --> 22:24.811
the fire must have been assisted
by some sort of accelerant.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.546
The lab came back negative
for any accelerant.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.948
But some accelerants,
when used in small amounts,

22:28.981 --> 22:30.683
often easily evaporate.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.819
Like hydrogen peroxide,
for instance.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.053
STEVENS: High concentrate
hydrogen peroxide

22:34.086 --> 22:37.557
might oxidize the fire enough
for enough for an explosion

22:37.590 --> 22:38.958
and not leave a trace.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.093
But that's difficult to obtain,
legally anyway.

22:41.127 --> 22:42.629
MEGAN:
Are we talking about

22:42.662 --> 22:44.464
the hydrogen peroxide
in my medicine cabinet?

22:44.497 --> 22:46.866
STEVENS: Charlie's talking about
industrial grade.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.868
Yeah, but Larry gets it
for his intro class every year.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.670
So a student could get
their hands on it.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.971
COLBY:
Hold on a second.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.440
If he uses gasoline for the SUV,

22:53.473 --> 22:54.674
why not use it for the booth?

22:54.707 --> 22:55.708
That would have been easier.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.445
It's more like choosing a poison

22:58.478 --> 23:00.012
that wouldn't show
up in an autopsy.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.849
So you're saying they intended
to kill whoever opened the door?

23:02.882 --> 23:05.852
You know, Larry posited
that the character of the fire

23:05.885 --> 23:07.454
will reveal the character

23:07.487 --> 23:09.756
of the person who set it.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.859
Yeah. Larry's right.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.093
And the person who

23:14.126 --> 23:15.795
set this fire is a murderer.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.606
The security booth fire is
an intentional homicide.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.608
The E.L.M. has no
history of murder.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.142
Yeah, but these nuts
hide five-inch spikes

23:30.176 --> 23:31.210
in the trunks of trees.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.945
If nobody dies,
that's just luck.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.481
I'm not defending
their methods,

23:34.514 --> 23:36.983
but the E.L.M. has stuck
to environmental targets--

23:37.016 --> 23:39.452
construction projects,
chemical pollutants.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.153
The injuries have
been unintentional.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.722
Well, not that
dealership fire, right?

23:42.755 --> 23:44.156
I mean, that was
designed to kill.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.526
Yeah, so either
that wasn't the E.L.M. or...

23:46.559 --> 23:47.760
Or else their
membership just got

23:47.794 --> 23:49.161
a hell of a lot
less exclusive.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.730
The roommate said
Jake was in touch

23:50.763 --> 23:52.465
-with people from Oregon, right?
-Online.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.001
Yeah, but I checked his e-mails,
I.M.'s and phone records,

23:55.034 --> 23:55.868
and I didn't find anything.

23:55.902 --> 23:56.869
What about chat rooms?

23:56.903 --> 23:58.738
Find out who their I.S.P. is,

23:58.771 --> 24:00.573
and subpoena their
records, all right?

24:06.679 --> 24:10.983
Used to be this garage was
for laundry and parking a car.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.152
Sorry. All my cognitive
emergence theory work's

24:13.185 --> 24:15.922
over there, so we
had to expand out.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.524
My God.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.259
You're pretty sure
you can identify

24:20.292 --> 24:22.028
a single arsonist?

24:22.061 --> 24:24.731
I'm not trying to identify
a particular person.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.165
I'm using
Principle Components Analysis

24:26.198 --> 24:31.604
and I'm inputting 600 variables
to quantify 5,000 fires

24:31.638 --> 24:32.672
to create a database

24:32.705 --> 24:35.474
that links the fires
to the people that set them.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.144
We're calling it a fireprint.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.178
What's the next variable?

24:39.211 --> 24:41.180
Piloted ignition temperature.

24:41.213 --> 24:44.183
Piloted ignition what?

24:44.216 --> 24:47.019
It's describing a fire that
needs a spark to ignite itself.

24:47.053 --> 24:47.954
Oh.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.055
It's like a fuse being lit.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.524
The match and the fuse together
both pilot the fire.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.525
How else does

24:52.559 --> 24:53.292
a fire get started?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.794
Spontaneous combustion.

24:54.827 --> 24:55.895
Yeah.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.631
A gas being heated to the point
of producing a flame

24:58.665 --> 25:00.199
without there being
an outside source.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.934
And that would be
an un-piloted fire, right?

25:01.968 --> 25:04.737
Yeah, but you have this
one described over here

25:04.771 --> 25:07.674
as a piloted and
un-piloted fire.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.076
You know, the S.U.V. fire
was started

25:10.109 --> 25:11.978
when gasoline was ignited
by a flame-- piloted.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.245
But the booth fire

25:13.279 --> 25:18.117
was caused by heat rising to the
point of oxidation-- un-piloted.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.586
That's right.
The explosion of flame

25:19.619 --> 25:21.754
was caused by
the combination of hot gases

25:21.788 --> 25:23.189
and the oxidation
of hydrogen peroxide.

25:23.222 --> 25:23.990
That's a very

25:24.023 --> 25:25.958
complicated way
of setting a fire.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.660
It is.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.196
Well, I mean, shouldn't they be
considered two separate fires?

25:30.229 --> 25:31.798
I mean, for this to be

25:31.831 --> 25:32.932
considered a fingerprint,

25:32.965 --> 25:36.235
then shouldn't every fire have
only one set of fingers?

25:36.268 --> 25:38.605
That's exactly right.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.140
One fire designed to kill,
the other isn't.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.975
There's two different agendas.

25:43.009 --> 25:46.212
Two different arsonists.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.981
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.851
So Jake Eckworth's Internet
service provider downloaded

25:51.884 --> 25:53.119
everything
from his I.P. address.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.320
And?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.288
Well, turns out, he was using
two different screen names

25:56.322 --> 25:57.857
and passwords.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.258
First one was
fairly straightforward.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.994
EarthAvenger.
His password was his birthday.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.996
But finding the password
to the second screen name

26:04.030 --> 26:05.732
has been an entirely
different story.

26:05.765 --> 26:07.834
Yeah, it looks like
Eckworth used

26:07.867 --> 26:09.869
a Diffie-Hellman
Encryption Code.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.137
( whistles )

26:11.170 --> 26:12.905
Basically, impossible to crack.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.008
And I'm guessing
we're gonna find

26:16.042 --> 26:17.176
all the good stuff

26:17.209 --> 26:18.878
behind that encrypted password.

26:18.911 --> 26:21.614
His second screen name
is NanoTube?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.883
Yeah. Sounds like
a nerd porno star, huh?

26:23.916 --> 26:25.718
Shows me where your head is at,
Granger.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.154
It's a technical term.

26:28.187 --> 26:32.258
I heard it used
the other day...

26:32.291 --> 26:34.694
when I was interviewing
Ethan Powell.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.966
How sure are you?

26:39.999 --> 26:41.634
Mathematically,
I'm almost positive.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.836
You see, when fires
are being investigated,

26:43.870 --> 26:45.037
several elements are studied,

26:45.071 --> 26:47.173
elements that form together
to create a fire signature.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.909
But unlike handwriting,

26:49.942 --> 26:51.644
elements of the fire signature

26:51.678 --> 26:54.080
are more general and less
individually specific.

26:54.113 --> 26:58.751
Elements like scorch marks,
rate of burn, accelerants, gas,

26:58.785 --> 27:00.787
acetone, kerosene, alcohol.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.289
So, I created a more
specific analysis,

27:03.322 --> 27:05.324
just like I did with the
theory of fingerprinting.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.793
I thought you didn't
like fingerprinting.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.760
I don't.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.696
The points of comparison
aren't standardized.

27:09.729 --> 27:10.763
Now with fingerprints,

27:10.797 --> 27:13.099
it's generally believed
that no two are the same.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.402
Well, that level of specificity
allows you to find matches

27:16.435 --> 27:19.105
with as little as seven points
of commonality.

27:19.138 --> 27:23.375
My fireprint analysis uses over
600 precise variables

27:23.409 --> 27:26.679
projected down to
a 15-dimensional hyperplane.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.215
So we have
15 numerical coordinates

27:29.248 --> 27:31.283
to match that level
of specificity.

27:31.317 --> 27:36.255
Now... these are the fireprints
from the two fires set

27:36.288 --> 27:37.690
at the S.U.V. dealership.

27:37.724 --> 27:38.691
Mm-hmm.

27:38.725 --> 27:39.358
They're not the same.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.226
Two different patterns.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.961
When I ran
these comparisons against

27:41.994 --> 27:44.230
other fires set in L.A.,
I found matches.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.332
The S.U.V. fire
was nearly identical

27:46.365 --> 27:48.701
to three other previous
E.L.M. fires.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.837
But the security booth fire

27:50.870 --> 27:52.839
was extremely dissimilar.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.841
So someone else set that fire.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.008
That's the theory.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.277
All right, so two arsonists.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.179
CHARLIE: Yeah. When I ran
the security booth fire

28:00.212 --> 28:03.249
against my database,
I found 17 identical fires

28:03.282 --> 28:05.384
going back almost five years.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.486
Five years?

28:07.519 --> 28:10.122
And none, not one of them,
had any environmental agenda

28:10.156 --> 28:13.125
or even the remotest connection
to the E.L.M.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.162
So one guy sets a typical E.L.M.
fire in the S.U.V...

28:16.195 --> 28:18.364
And the other guy sets
the security booth fire,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.833
only that one is intended
to actually kill somebody.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.001
A leader and a follower.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.102
It's Leopold and Loeb.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.404
Leopold and who?

28:25.437 --> 28:28.174
It was the most sensational
murder of the 1920s.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.876
These two guys
killed a little boy

28:29.909 --> 28:31.143
simply to prove that they could.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.912
Loeb was
the dominant personality,

28:32.945 --> 28:34.914
-and Leopold looked up to him.
-( cell phone rings )

28:34.947 --> 28:36.983
Jake Eckworth. Ethan Powell.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.185
Eppes.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.153
Yeah. On our way.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.889
Okay. Another fire.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.824
How is that possible?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.358
Eckworth's been
under surveillance.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.127
Yeah, but Ethan hasn't been.

28:50.196 --> 28:54.033
( sirens blaring )

29:06.846 --> 29:08.514
It's arson.

29:08.547 --> 29:09.916
E.L.M. again.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.784
The fire was contained
to the sixth floor.

29:11.818 --> 29:12.785
What's up there?

29:12.819 --> 29:14.420
Oil exploration company.

29:14.453 --> 29:17.089
They have bids in
to drill in Alaska.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.357
What exactly happened?

29:18.390 --> 29:20.259
Standard teams went in,
got up there,

29:20.292 --> 29:22.929
flashover hit six guys before
they had a chance to get out.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.196
What's flashover?

29:24.230 --> 29:27.066
When everything in the room
ignites at once.

29:27.099 --> 29:27.900
CHARLIE:
What might have prevented

29:27.934 --> 29:29.501
the entire building
from burning?

29:29.535 --> 29:33.940
Fire doors must have
done their job.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.174
Lucky for us, huh?

29:41.347 --> 29:43.549
Fire doors, my ass.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.818
That fire wasn't meant
to burn the building,

29:45.852 --> 29:47.153
it was meant
to hit those men.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.089
Let's say the arsonist,
or arsonists, plural,

29:50.122 --> 29:52.158
know how to engineer
a back draft.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.459
Then doesn't it stand to reason

29:53.492 --> 29:55.161
that they could
create a flashover?

29:55.194 --> 29:59.098
Well, look, we're talking about
a serial killer now, right?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.467
Yeah. Who's using fires
as a weapon.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.139
CHARLIE: So they're saying
the fire doors

30:07.173 --> 30:09.475
were able to contain the
blaze to the sixth floor.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.978
Okay, which supports
Megan's theory that people

30:12.011 --> 30:14.580
were the arsonist's real target.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.482
How did he do this?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.250
Likely, used an accelerant.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.119
STEVENS:
There was no accelerant.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.053
Hang in there, man.

30:21.087 --> 30:23.089
I double-checked
the thermodynamics myself.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.390
There was no accelerant.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.558
If you don't mind--
this is me just being me-

30:26.592 --> 30:28.961
-I'd like to recheck
those calculations. -Please.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.530
I am just about
at the end of my rope.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.233
How long were the men up there?

30:34.266 --> 30:35.634
No more than a few seconds.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.236
And that was sufficient
to cause all this?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.304
It shouldn't have been.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.906
Continue, please.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.074
Well, this was
a fairly typical fire.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.876
I mean, given it was
a high rise,

30:43.910 --> 30:45.444
it presented certain
logistical problems,

30:45.477 --> 30:46.545
but nothing that these guys

30:46.578 --> 30:47.679
shouldn't have been
able to handle.

30:47.713 --> 30:50.516
I mean, they hooked their hoses
to the standpipe, okay?

30:50.549 --> 30:51.984
What is that, the standpipe?

30:52.018 --> 30:52.919
The building's
water supply pipe.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.987
-It's firefighter use only.
-And it was

30:55.021 --> 30:56.923
-functioning properly? -The
truck's computer said it had

30:56.956 --> 30:57.990
all the water it needed.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.259
This fire should have been out
in a few minutes.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.860
Then why didn't it go out?

31:05.297 --> 31:06.532
That's the same question

31:06.565 --> 31:08.334
I have six families
asking me right now.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.273
That's it.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.075
It's all there.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.019
So you set all the fires?

31:27.053 --> 31:29.155
Your buddy Jake had
nothing to do with it, huh?

31:29.188 --> 31:30.156
Yep. It was all me.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.566
First degree murder, that's
life in prison if you're lucky.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.203
That's a big weight
to carry alone.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.504
You still don't think

31:45.537 --> 31:46.939
I'm capable of it, do you?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.340
My I.Q. is over 160.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.709
What I didn't think
you were capable of

31:50.742 --> 31:52.044
was being this stupid.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.517
You need to sign it the bottom,
initial each page.

32:06.492 --> 32:10.729
( sighs )

32:10.762 --> 32:12.498
Maybe he's telling
the truth.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.201
Charlie's fireprint
proves that there were

32:15.234 --> 32:16.202
two different arsonists

32:16.235 --> 32:17.336
at that car dealership.

32:17.369 --> 32:21.507
And one of them is intentionally
trying to kill people.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.675
I don't think Ethan
has that in him.

32:23.709 --> 32:27.013
Press Relations has already
issued a release

32:27.046 --> 32:29.681
saying we found our guy.

32:29.715 --> 32:33.385
You know, 300 years ago,
London burned to the ground,

32:33.419 --> 32:36.388
and the guy that confessed to it
wasn't even in London

32:36.422 --> 32:38.024
the night of the fire.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.125
But they didn't realize that

32:39.158 --> 32:40.592
till two days
after they hanged him.

32:42.561 --> 32:45.231
Sometimes, people say
things to be noticed

32:45.264 --> 32:47.366
because sometimes,
being ignored

32:47.399 --> 32:49.101
is worse than being blamed.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.772
CHARLIE: Steven's calculations
were correct.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.109
There was no accelerant and the
computer read-out on the truck

32:57.143 --> 32:58.377
was functioning properly.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.413
Yeah, okay,
small fire, no accelerant,

33:01.447 --> 33:02.481
a sufficiency of water.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.550
The fire should have been
extinguished in minutes.

33:04.583 --> 33:06.318
Yeah.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.588
And reality agrees.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.223
The fire goes out.

33:12.691 --> 33:13.525
( Alan clears throat )

33:13.559 --> 33:16.528
You know,
I'm not even going to ask.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.230
Okay, look,
there was another fire,

33:18.264 --> 33:20.132
and, apparently,
a signed confession

33:20.166 --> 33:23.069
does not satisfy Professor
Eppes' standard of guilt.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.536
CHARLIE: I sort of understand
what it's like

33:24.570 --> 33:25.704
to be this kid,
Ethan Powell.

33:25.737 --> 33:27.673
You know... my freshman
year at Princeton,

33:27.706 --> 33:29.808
there were times I where
pretty desperate to fit in,

33:29.841 --> 33:31.043
any way I could.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.111
ALAN:
What are you saying?

33:32.144 --> 33:34.746
That you are who you are
because of just dumb luck?

33:34.780 --> 33:36.415
That you were just

33:36.448 --> 33:38.550
one roommate away
from being a pyromaniac?

33:38.584 --> 33:39.551
No, of course not.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.153
That's clearly not what I mean.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.121
ALAN:
Good.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.156
Because that wouldn't say much
for the time

33:44.190 --> 33:45.824
that your mother and I
put into raising you,

33:45.857 --> 33:47.426
He makes
a good point, Charles.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.761
You know, there's just
something I don't understand.

33:49.795 --> 33:52.598
Dad, you know about fire
suppression systems.

33:52.631 --> 33:53.832
You know about standpipes
and sprinklers.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.301
ALAN:
Yeah, of course.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.435
That was one
of the highest priorities

33:56.468 --> 33:58.604
and one of the biggest
headaches for a city planner.

33:58.637 --> 33:59.838
So answer me this.

33:59.871 --> 34:03.409
How could firefighters have
adequate enough water pressure

34:03.442 --> 34:05.844
and still not be able
to put out a fire?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.147
Let me show you.

34:09.248 --> 34:10.316
Larry.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.651
Turn the water on, okay?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.153
-High.
-Yeah.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.488
ALAN:
All right.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.589
-Now turn it lower.
-Okay.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.526
Slowly.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.794
Not off.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.564
That's it.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.800
There.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.269
Dad, that's
Pascal's Principle.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.471
Water distributes its force
uniformly,

34:32.504 --> 34:34.640
There's no way to tell
how much water volume there is

34:34.673 --> 34:36.108
based on the pressure.

34:42.881 --> 34:45.484
Fire hoses...

34:45.517 --> 34:47.453
have nozzles

34:47.486 --> 34:49.621
that automatically
maintain high pressure,

34:49.655 --> 34:51.123
just like your thumb just did.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.492
And the pressure
created by the nozzle

34:53.525 --> 34:56.762
hid the actual amount of water
flowing through their hoses.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.530
So they were fooled
into thinking

34:58.564 --> 35:00.466
they had normal amounts
of water.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.501
Which means
between the water supply

35:02.534 --> 35:04.436
and the fire fighters
on the sixth floor...

35:04.470 --> 35:07.506
the actual water volume
decreased.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.807
Which suggests

35:08.840 --> 35:11.610
that someone tampered
with the standpipe.

35:11.643 --> 35:13.445
Dad, who would know how

35:13.479 --> 35:15.514
a building's
standpipe system works?

35:15.547 --> 35:18.384
Contractors, plumbers,
firemen, engineers.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.486
I got to go talk to Don.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.224
Yeah, but I still have to take
a shower, you know.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.895
-No, thanks.
-Okay, all right.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.797
The arsonist tampered
with the standpipe

35:31.830 --> 35:33.665
and reduced the water volume
to a point

35:33.699 --> 35:35.534
that the firemen
couldn't detect.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.804
The water pressure seemed normal
when they turned their hoses on.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.806
Which would take a pretty
sophisticated understanding

35:40.839 --> 35:43.542
-of engineering.
-Which Ethan certainly has.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.511
Now, there are other factors,
as well.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.645
Remember, he character
of the fire...

35:46.678 --> 35:48.780
Should match the character
of the person that set it.

35:48.814 --> 35:52.551
And whoever set the booth fire
was clearly expecting a fireman

35:52.584 --> 35:54.286
to be the first responder.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.688
Firemen were clearly the targets
at the high-rise, as well,

35:56.722 --> 35:58.924
so your second arsonist

35:58.957 --> 36:00.426
is setting traps
for firefighters.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.727
Which doesn't fit Ethan.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.196
He's trying to impress Jake,

36:04.230 --> 36:05.697
and the E.L.M., and his peers.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.533
Doesn't that give us only half
the team?

36:07.566 --> 36:09.701
Yeah, well,
he ain't talking, so...

36:09.735 --> 36:12.571
Because he wants
to take full credit for this.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.274
He doesn't understand
what he's taking credit for

36:15.307 --> 36:15.974
is murder.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.909
Why did you bring me back here?

36:17.943 --> 36:19.511
MEGAN:
Because I want the truth.

36:19.545 --> 36:21.247
I already told you the truth.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.449
You only told me part of it.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.851
You think this makes you cool?

36:25.884 --> 36:28.487
You think this is gonna make
other people look up to you?

36:28.520 --> 36:29.988
Look, I told you everything
I'm gonna tell you.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.557
Yeah.

36:31.590 --> 36:35.561
That's why I brought
someone here for you to talk to.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.997
What are you doing here?

36:39.030 --> 36:41.367
They told me
what was going on.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.636
Well, thanks for coming down,
but I got it under control.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.304
I don't think so, dude.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.605
I don't care what you think.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.006
I think maybe you do care.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.642
I think maybe you care too much
what I think.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.411
Don't flatter yourself, Jake.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.913
You know, sometimes,
you can be a real jerk, Ethan.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.983
You have any idea what it's like
to be around a kid

36:58.016 --> 36:59.985
who thinks he knows
everything and usually does?

37:00.018 --> 37:01.553
This guy you're protecting?

37:01.587 --> 37:02.621
He used you, Ethan.

37:02.654 --> 37:03.755
He wanted
your engineering skills

37:03.789 --> 37:05.657
-to help him create more
elaborate fires. -I don't know

37:05.691 --> 37:06.458
what you're talking about.

37:06.492 --> 37:07.593
Don't lie to them anymore,
Ethan.

37:07.626 --> 37:12.464
You set it up for me to meet him
in Glendale, remember?

37:17.636 --> 37:18.670
Dude, he wants to kill people.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.671
You're wrong.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.940
What happened to that salesman
was an accident.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.009
When have you ever made an
accident in engineering, Ethan?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.944
I mean, come on, you
had to have some idea

37:25.977 --> 37:27.045
what this guy was doing.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.481
You wanted to join
the E-L-M, right?

37:29.515 --> 37:30.482
You wanted us all to think

37:30.516 --> 37:31.483
that you could handle
what we're all about.

37:31.517 --> 37:33.952
Then show me now
you can handle it, and tell them

37:33.985 --> 37:35.787
what they want to know.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.923
There are six firefighters
in a hospital,

37:37.956 --> 37:39.625
fighting for their lives.

37:42.461 --> 37:43.729
Dude, it's okay.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.070
( sighs )

37:52.103 --> 37:54.740
I don't know his name.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.408
We only talked online.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.609
MEGAN: Then give me
your password

37:57.643 --> 37:58.510
to your second screen name,

37:58.544 --> 38:00.379
and we can trace him
from your account.

38:01.747 --> 38:02.681
Ethan,

38:02.714 --> 38:05.384
you have to help us find him
before he hurts

38:05.417 --> 38:06.485
someone else.

38:10.989 --> 38:14.560
I've got a line
on the kid's ISP,

38:14.593 --> 38:17.529
which is giving me a back trace
to his chat room buddy.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.098
Links up to a computer

38:20.131 --> 38:21.833
at 200 Anaheim Street.

38:21.867 --> 38:22.834
DON:
Anaheim Street.

38:22.868 --> 38:23.635
Where's that?

38:23.669 --> 38:25.704
Station 117 firehouse.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.539
LAFD.

38:27.573 --> 38:30.409
Specifically,
the Arson Investigation Squad.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.610
How do you know that?

38:31.643 --> 38:33.745
Remember I said
that the one fireprint

38:33.779 --> 38:35.447
linked 17 fires over 5 years.

38:35.481 --> 38:36.748
Yeah.

38:36.782 --> 38:40.619
Guess who investigated all 17
of those fires?

38:40.652 --> 38:41.820
Stevens.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.456
Perfect-- he sets fires he knows
he's going to investigate.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.857
Yeah, because it's easy
to look smart

38:45.891 --> 38:47.593
when you know everything
about the fire.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.595
Because you're the one
who set it.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.497
He was using me all along.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.432
MEGAN: Serial arsonists
have a driving need

38:53.465 --> 38:55.000
to prove they're smarter
than everyone else.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.603
Stevens applied for the Los
Angeles Fire Department

38:57.636 --> 38:58.704
eight years ago,

38:58.737 --> 38:59.738
and didn't pass
the screening.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.006
He got a job at a smaller city

39:01.039 --> 39:03.008
and then worked his way
back to L.A.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.610
We got two teams

39:04.643 --> 39:05.411
up at Stevens's house.

39:05.444 --> 39:06.845
CHP, PD, and
Sheriff's Department

39:06.878 --> 39:08.780
have all been alerted, but
there's no sign

39:08.814 --> 39:11.016
-of his car yet. -Megan, do you
think he's the type to run?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.118
No. He's enjoyed this too much
to let it end with a ride

39:13.151 --> 39:14.920
to Mexico-- he's gonna need
to teach us a lesson.

39:14.953 --> 39:15.921
Every fire he set

39:15.954 --> 39:18.857
required days,
really even weeks of planning.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.792
Plus, he definitely saw us
talking at that last fire,

39:20.826 --> 39:21.727
so he knows we're close.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.629
Which makes him dangerous
and in a hurry.

39:23.662 --> 39:25.531
He was going to meet Jake
at the Glendale development.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.466
COLBY:
That's right-- now, why there?

39:27.499 --> 39:28.534
Unless he's planning a strike.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.168
Yeah. All right,
you come with me.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.503
We need tactical and
fire prevention units

39:31.537 --> 39:32.871
up to Verdugo Ridge, ASAP!

39:32.904 --> 39:34.005
MEGAN:
Okay.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.874
I don't see why he needed Ethan.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.909
He wanted bigger
and deadlier fires, Charlie.

39:37.943 --> 39:40.512
Ethan's engineering skills
could help him do that.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.113
By pretending
that he needed my help

39:42.147 --> 39:44.015
with the arson investigations.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.584
He did need your help, Charlie.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.553
Serial killers will
often contact the police

39:47.586 --> 39:49.020
if an investigation stalls.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.822
They know they're going
to keep hurting people.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.057
They want someone to stop them.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.158
May I?

39:54.125 --> 39:55.427
You did good.

40:07.072 --> 40:10.208
( wind howling )

40:10.241 --> 40:12.944
( sirens wailing )

40:12.978 --> 40:14.846
( tires screeching )

40:35.266 --> 40:37.035
Stevens!

40:39.070 --> 40:40.839
Stevens, it's over!

40:40.872 --> 40:41.940
You hear me?!

40:41.973 --> 40:44.743
MEGAN: We know what happened
to you eight years ago.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.213
We know that the Los Angeles
Fire Department turned you down.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.620
STEVENS:
They said I wasn't good enough.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.721
MEGAN:
I understand.

40:57.288 --> 41:01.560
We know better-- we know
what you're capable of.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.863
Paul.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.064
White phosphorous.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.133
If this hits the air,
it explodes.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.100
Okay.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.268
Kind of fire that really
makes an impression.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.737
Okay, let's just take it easy.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.506
-Okay? Paul, just listen to me.
-Back up.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.040
-Paul?
-Back up!

41:15.073 --> 41:16.274
I'm backing up.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.876
-Everybody back up.
-Slowly.

41:17.909 --> 41:18.744
We're backing up-- just relax.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.079
Trust me, I know
what I'm talking about.

41:21.112 --> 41:21.747
Let's just talk.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.014
Paul, don't.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.015
Whatever you're thinking,
don't do it.

41:24.049 --> 41:24.883
I'm getting out of here.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.251
-Don't do it!
-Ow!

41:45.804 --> 41:47.539
( grunts ):
Damn it.

41:47.573 --> 41:49.575
Dad, Dad, Dad.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.042
-Oh, boy.
-Hey, guys.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.911
What, you got,
plumbing problems again?

41:52.944 --> 41:54.913
More like one of Charlie's
hands-on investigations.

41:54.946 --> 41:57.182
I used the shower
for a standpipe.

41:57.215 --> 41:59.050
Now we're having a hard time
un-using it.

41:59.084 --> 42:00.552
Hey, that kid took
a plea bargain.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.320
He did? How many years.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.255
Three years.

42:04.289 --> 42:06.224
Boy, one wrong decision,
his whole life's almost ruined.

42:06.257 --> 42:07.325
Yeah.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.694
Well, sometimes,
that's all it takes.

42:08.727 --> 42:10.128
CHARLIE: You know,
I know what it's like

42:10.161 --> 42:11.229
to be that kid.

42:11.262 --> 42:14.065
I wished that I was
a normal college kid sometimes.

42:14.099 --> 42:15.867
Kind of tough when
you're still in puberty.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.002
ALAN:
Yeah, well, I'm sure

42:17.035 --> 42:18.870
there were plenty of kids
who wished they were you.

42:18.904 --> 42:20.606
Uh, during midterms, certainly.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.973
At keg parties,

42:22.007 --> 42:23.842
absolutely not.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.076
How about at shop class?

42:25.110 --> 42:26.344
What do you mean?

42:26.377 --> 42:28.279
I mean, how about
we call a plumber?

42:28.313 --> 42:29.848
Dad, I can...
give me the wrench.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.950
-Give me it.
-You can't do it.

42:31.983 --> 42:34.152
And we're sending
the bill to the FBI.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.787
Here, give it to me,
I'll do it.

42:37.889 --> 42:38.857
-Here.
-All right.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.292
-Come on, put your
hand on this valve. -Okay.

42:41.326 --> 42:42.694
( grunting ):
Okay.

42:42.728 --> 42:44.162
I'm telling you this,
if the toilet goes,

42:44.195 --> 42:45.263
you're on your own.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.364
-Just hold it.
-Oh...

42:46.397 --> 42:47.699
-Just hold it.
-Ow. That's my hand.

42:47.733 --> 42:48.767
-All right.
-That's my finger!

42:48.800 --> 42:49.835
Ow!
