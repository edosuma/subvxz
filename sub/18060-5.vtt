00:04.963 --> 00:08.675
<i>So, the Knave of Hearts and I brought her</i>

ALICE: <i>He's here. I can feel it.</i>

00:10.469 --> 00:12.471

-Mother.

00:57.683 --> 01:00.185
-Did you follow us here?
-Damn right I did.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.772
You're going to run off with this

01:04.815 --> 01:05.858
loser?

01:06.733 --> 01:09.653
-Is that what's happening here?
-It's none of your business.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.904
I birthed you, dear.

01:11.655 --> 01:15.534
So if you are going to ruin your life,
it absolutely is.

01:15.617 --> 01:16.994
It's ruined, Mom.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.831
-I found Will.
-I know.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.501
-That's the tragedy.
-Oi!

01:26.211 --> 01:29.548
I wanted a queen for a daughter,
but what did I get instead?

01:31.049 --> 01:32.134
A failure.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.304
I'm happy. Finally.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.513
With him?

01:37.848 --> 01:41.935
I did not spend my entire life
working my fingers to the bone

01:42.019 --> 01:45.522
so that you could move up,
only to have you toss it all away.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.567
Obviously, you're not princess material,

01:48.650 --> 01:51.153
but I thought you could at least
land a nobleman.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.948
Not him, Will Scarlet, the thief.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.159
I'm no thief. Not anymore.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.536
What kind of a life
is he going to give you?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.496
He doesn't need to give me anything.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.208
(WHISPERS) I love him.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.588
You cannot live on love, Anastasia.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.423
And when you learn that lesson
the hard way,

02:11.507 --> 02:13.592
you will be right back here
where you started.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.970
But when you come back, bring a bucket.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.225
Because the only way
you'll be coming back inside my house

02:22.142 --> 02:24.186
is to empty my chamber pot.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.023
Off with you then.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.735
At least I have your sisters.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.237
WILL: Don't listen to her.

02:34.196 --> 02:36.949
I'll build us a life,
brick by brick if I have to.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.203
I love you, for who you truly are.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.455
Not for who I want you to be.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.210
If I hadn't bribed you with that wish,
you would have never...

04:14.046 --> 04:16.507
Cyrus always said they had consequences.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.092
Now I understand.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.930
I will get you out of this.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.849
If I can find Cyrus,
then together we can...

04:28.477 --> 04:30.062
Who am I fooling?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.482
I don't even know where he is.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.402
Then it's a good thing I do, darling.

04:38.195 --> 04:42.032
-Perhaps we can help one another.
-Why would I do anything to help you?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.951
You'd be surprised
what people are willing to do

04:44.034 --> 04:45.827
when the right circumstances
present themselves.

04:45.911 --> 04:47.913
There's not a circumstance
you could present

04:47.996 --> 04:50.332
-that would ever...
-Not even finding out

04:50.415 --> 04:52.543
where your precious genie is being held?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.212
Yes.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.298
So, why don't you get down
off your high horse,

04:58.382 --> 05:00.384
and we can make a deal?

05:02.427 --> 05:03.679
What sort of a deal?

05:03.762 --> 05:07.182
The sort of deal to handle
the one problem we both share...

05:07.266 --> 05:08.559
Jafar.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.813
You're working together.
How is he a problem for you?

05:12.896 --> 05:15.607
Well, he's simply
a means to an end, darling.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.736
But when that end comes, I need to ensure
I have the power to protect myself.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.366
Wouldn't want to end up
like your friend here, now, would we?

05:28.704 --> 05:30.539
He was your friend, too, once.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.710
More than a friend, from what I gather.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.755
Or was he just a means to an end as well?

05:39.756 --> 05:42.843
That's your problem, Alice.
Always dwelling on the past,

05:43.802 --> 05:46.096
when really you should be
thinking about the future.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.850
-What exactly is it you want me to do?
-Help me procure something.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.061
Just a little bit of magic
in the form of dust.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.772
It's about a day's journey away.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.611
And it's going to protect me
against dark magic such as Jafar's.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.198
If you want it so badly, get it yourself.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.241
I would, darling,

06:06.325 --> 06:08.994
but there's a reason something
so powerful sits untouched.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.331
Retrieving it, for most,
is a suicide mission.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.709
And you think I'll just agree
to risk my life?

06:15.792 --> 06:18.962
No. No, not unless
you're properly compensated.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.092
Which is why I propose a trade.

06:25.052 --> 06:29.014
You get me the dust,
and I'll help you find your genie.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.725
I'll find him myself, thank you.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.561
Not if you don't know
where you're looking.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.190
Jafar's tower is hidden,
enshrouded by magic.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.692
You could be standing
right in front of it,

06:40.776 --> 06:42.736
not knowing it's there, without my help.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.491
If you want to find Cyrus,
then I am your best bet.

06:48.283 --> 06:49.701

to the top.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.997
-For what purpose?
-None.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.999

-Doesn't matter.

-And so my punishment continues.
-Well, not for long, old man.

we get out of here.

08:16.371 --> 08:18.874

08:18.957 --> 08:21.502

the other day? Any left?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.548
No. Just the bones.

and call it soup.

things would be different here.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.335
When I first heard about Wonderland,

09:03.418 --> 09:06.672
I figured that the "wonder"
was short for "wonderful,"

09:06.755 --> 09:09.049
not "wonder how we're gonna make it?"

09:09.132 --> 09:12.010

-Can't. It's for the palace.

and every crumb's spoken for.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.450

-But we haven't found any berries yet.
-No, to the ball. We should go.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.545
I hear the palace is dazzling inside.

09:46.628 --> 09:50.382
Yeah. There's the slight matter
of not being invited.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.050
Since when has that ever stopped us?

09:52.968 --> 09:55.637
We could both do with
a little change of scenery.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.598
And more importantly, some of that bread.

10:01.185 --> 10:05.731

to gain from all of this?

are on the outside.

Alice...

31:19.755 --> 31:22.883
Congratulations. You did it.

31:25.093 --> 31:29.014
-But she lives.
-Indeed, that was the test.

31:30.098 --> 31:32.726
You truly are pure of heart.

31:34.353 --> 31:35.395
Would you?

31:43.362 --> 31:44.655
(ALICE GASPS)

31:46.532 --> 31:50.202
-The magic dust! We did it.
-Yes.

31:52.788 --> 31:56.708
I don't understand.
Why didn't you kill me?

31:59.086 --> 32:01.588
You'd have had everything you wanted.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.342
Because I'm not like you.

32:06.468 --> 32:07.511
No.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.181
I suppose you're not.

32:32.911 --> 32:34.162
(LOCK CLICKS)

32:59.771 --> 33:01.565
(GASPS)

33:03.483 --> 33:05.068
Pretty, isn't it?

33:06.987 --> 33:08.030
(GASPS)

33:09.239 --> 33:11.241
Come on, then. Hand it over.

33:14.995 --> 33:17.956
First, tell me where I can find Cyrus.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.625
Oh, Alice.

33:20.459 --> 33:24.046
Isn't being such a good person
reward enough?

33:24.129 --> 33:26.006
-(WHOOSHES)
-(GASPS)

33:26.131 --> 33:27.132
(LAUGHS)

33:27.591 --> 33:30.302
-You lied.
-Indeed.

33:31.261 --> 33:32.596
Lest we forget...

33:33.764 --> 33:37.601
-One of us is pure of heart.
-I gave you your life.

33:37.684 --> 33:40.354
No! Nobody ever gave me anything.

33:42.481 --> 33:46.026
Everything I have, I had to take.

33:46.109 --> 33:47.778
What about everything you've lost?

33:51.698 --> 33:56.161
Take care, Alice.
I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.665
Can't hold on to those wishes forever,

34:00.290 --> 34:02.793
or the hope of seeing Cyrus again.

34:05.087 --> 34:06.338
Hmph.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.599
I will see him again.

34:20.269 --> 34:21.270
GUARD: Did you hear that?

34:24.147 --> 34:27.901
Jafar will have our heads
if anyone gets away. Let's go have a look.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.961
Thank you, Rabbit.
I actually think that was helpful.

34:46.086 --> 34:48.881
-Uh, can I leave now?
-Not quite.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.257
But I've told you everything.

34:50.340 --> 34:53.552
There might not be more to say,
but there's certainly more to do.

34:54.845 --> 34:57.681
-I'd like to take a trip now.
-Well, you've got your carpet.

34:57.764 --> 35:01.143
Where I want to go is
a place only you can take me.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.898
-Start digging.
-Jafar, I can't just leave.

35:05.981 --> 35:07.691
The Queen will know something is wrong...

35:07.774 --> 35:12.571
You work for me now, Rabbit.
Or do I really need to remind you?

35:12.654 --> 35:14.406
-(WHITE RABBIT WHIMPERS)
-(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

35:16.742 --> 35:18.327
Rabbit!

35:19.995 --> 35:22.372
-Rabbit!
-(WHIMPERS)

35:24.583 --> 35:26.335
-JAFAR: Rabbit!
-(GASPS)

35:26.418 --> 35:29.421
-(WHISPERS) Please don't.
-(WHIMPERS)

35:29.505 --> 35:31.965
-JAFAR: Rabbit!
-Just go.

35:32.049 --> 35:34.718
-What?
-Find her. Go!

35:41.850 --> 35:42.851
Rabbit!

35:46.772 --> 35:51.610
I know it's futile to resist you, Jafar.
I'll do what you ask.

35:51.693 --> 35:54.154
You made the right choice.

35:54.238 --> 35:57.074
Even if you did find
your way out of the tower,

35:57.157 --> 36:00.702
-there's no escaping what's beyond it.
-What does that mean?

36:00.786 --> 36:04.456
Just be glad you didn't find out.
Now dig your hole.

36:04.540 --> 36:07.835
-Where to?
-You know where.

36:09.169 --> 36:10.212
Oh.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.216
(WHOOSHING)

36:30.816 --> 36:34.945
Sneaking into my ball was one thing.
I rather admire the boldness of it.

36:36.405 --> 36:40.242
But stealing from me? What possessed you?

36:41.410 --> 36:43.078
-Does it matter?
-It might.

36:44.830 --> 36:48.458
You have more wealth than anyone
in the realm. You'll hardly miss it.

36:54.131 --> 36:57.843
-I need it more than you do.
-What does a peasant need with jewels?

36:57.926 --> 37:01.597
-What does a king need with them?
-That, my dear, is the way it goes.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.184
My world filled with wealth, and yours,

37:06.476 --> 37:07.895
filled with longing.

37:09.396 --> 37:11.940
Generally, our realms don't meet.

37:13.817 --> 37:15.152
You caught me.

37:19.239 --> 37:22.034
-What will my fate be?
-That depends on you.

37:23.243 --> 37:25.245
Ah, there's something about you, girl.

37:27.456 --> 37:32.002
The life you're in, it isn't the one
you were meant for, is it?

37:32.085 --> 37:35.506
-It's all I need.
-Then why are you stealing?

37:41.512 --> 37:44.848
What if instead of stealing
these jewels, they simply

37:46.183 --> 37:48.352
belonged to you?

37:49.478 --> 37:51.313
-You'll give them to me?
-Perhaps.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.149
At what price?

37:55.609 --> 37:56.902
Your hand

37:58.487 --> 37:59.905
in marriage.

38:03.367 --> 38:05.202
I have been searching for a queen.

38:06.954 --> 38:08.956
And you fit the bill.

38:23.178 --> 38:24.388
What you have

38:25.514 --> 38:27.224
goes far beyond your beauty.

38:27.307 --> 38:29.643
What you have is what is most elusive,

38:30.644 --> 38:33.438
the drive to be more than you are.

38:34.398 --> 38:37.860
That is how one rules.

38:38.986 --> 38:40.529
And that

38:42.656 --> 38:45.742
is what I desire at my side.

38:47.828 --> 38:51.498
-What if I love another?
-Yes, the fellow from the ball.

38:53.125 --> 38:56.044
Love is a noble thing.

38:57.129 --> 39:00.507
But how far will it get you, hmm?
Let's say you sell this.

39:01.466 --> 39:04.136
How long will it last you before
you're right back where you started?

39:04.887 --> 39:06.763
And that love you cling to,

39:07.806 --> 39:11.560
it won't be long before you realize
it's not enough.

39:12.811 --> 39:16.648
And then? And then, my dear,
it will be too late for you.

39:20.944 --> 39:23.071
Come on, come on.

39:25.574 --> 39:28.076
(TRUMPETS PLAYING FANFARE)

All right, Cyrus.
I know you're out there somewhere.

41:40.626 --> 41:42.544
Now show me. (BLOWS)

42:01.313 --> 42:02.731
I'm coming for you.

42:15.786 --> 42:17.663
Alice, I'm coming for you.
