00:01.995 --> 00:02.995
<i>GRACE: Previously on
The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...</i>

00:03.029 --> 00:03.428
I cannot believe
we did that.

00:03.463 --> 00:05.830
I can't either.

00:05.865 --> 00:08.032
We're on our honeymoon.
Kind of. We eloped.

00:08.067 --> 00:09.868
Just because we're
no longer roromamass

00:09.903 --> 00:11.003
and we're not going
to the same school

00:11.037 --> 00:12.204
doesn't mean
we're aren't friends.

00:12.238 --> 00:14.806
You and I are really
going our separate ways.

00:14.841 --> 00:16.074
You're not just here
to say goodbye,

00:16.109 --> 00:18.176
you're here to say
yodon't want to be
friends with me.

00:18.211 --> 00:21.079
You and I both know
we were in the lab
with a Bunsen burner

00:21.114 --> 00:23.849
<i>that we probably left
burning when we left.
I doubt it.</i>

00:23.883 --> 00:26.852
Did you and Dylan
have something to do
with that fire at her school?

00:26.886 --> 00:27.986
Absolutely not.

00:28.021 --> 00:29.788
Where are Amy and Ricky?

00:29.822 --> 00:31.089
They're not here,
that's where they are.

00:31.124 --> 00:33.792
What if you and Anne
and Margaret and
Shakur and I

00:33.826 --> 00:35.060
missed seeing
those two get married?

00:35.094 --> 00:37.930
You remember that girl
that I made out with
at the party?

00:37.964 --> 00:38.964
What about her?

00:38.998 --> 00:40.899
I've kind of
been out with her.

00:40.934 --> 00:42.034
Whose feet are those?

00:42.068 --> 00:44.136
They're mine, sir.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.838
I'm sure if Ben had something
to do with that fire,
it was an accident.

00:46.873 --> 00:48.040
I have to tell my dad
what happened.

00:48.074 --> 00:50.108
I think I recall
your dad telling you

00:50.143 --> 00:52.978
that if you got into
any trouble with me,
you're on your own.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.814
I told Ricky and Amy
I'd babysit
if they wanted to go elope.

00:55.848 --> 00:56.214
I even paid for the hotel.

01:06.826 --> 01:07.726
If I'd known you were
all going to be here,

01:07.760 --> 01:08.927
I would have picked up
some eye of newt.

01:13.132 --> 01:15.067
Bye-bye.

01:20.073 --> 01:22.774
Hey...

01:22.809 --> 01:24.142
If Amy and Ricky
got married,

01:24.177 --> 01:26.078
I am really going
to be upset with you.

01:26.112 --> 01:27.879
Why? Why me?
Be upset with them

01:27.947 --> 01:28.880
if you want to be
upset with anyone,

01:28.915 --> 01:30.015
although I don't know
why you'd be upset.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.083
You and your
kitchen mates.

01:31.117 --> 01:33.118
Because we're
their mothers.

01:33.152 --> 01:35.020
Oh. Hey, Ashley.

01:35.054 --> 01:36.788
I was going to
knock on your door
when I got here,

01:36.823 --> 01:38.090
but I figured
you'd be asleep.

01:38.124 --> 01:39.791
I missed you this week,

01:39.826 --> 01:41.026
I got used to
seeing you every day.

01:43.129 --> 01:44.096
Aren't you going
to say anything?

01:44.864 --> 01:45.998
Like?

01:46.032 --> 01:47.132
Like good morning.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.134
Oh, yeah.
Good morning.

01:49.168 --> 01:51.970
You just kind of
took me by surprise.

01:52.005 --> 01:54.106
I thought Dad told you
that I couldn't go to
your condo this weekend.

01:54.140 --> 01:57.009
Oh, he did tell me.
In a text.

01:57.043 --> 01:58.977
And if you'd
rather stay here
and hang out with Toby,

01:59.012 --> 01:59.978
I totally understand,

02:00.013 --> 02:01.713
we were gone
for a long time

02:01.748 --> 02:03.982
and I'm sure
you two have a lot
of catching up to do.

02:04.017 --> 02:05.784
I know friends
are important, too.

02:05.818 --> 02:08.086
Toby? Who said
anything about Toby?
Stay on topic.

02:08.121 --> 02:11.790
Uh, what is the
topic exactly?

02:11.824 --> 02:13.725
Does she know
that Ricky and Amy
might have eloped?

02:13.760 --> 02:14.793
I don't know.
Do you?

02:14.827 --> 02:17.996
No. I don't know,
and I don't care.

02:18.031 --> 02:20.065
Really?
You don't know anything?

02:20.099 --> 02:23.935
No, they wouldn't tell me
any big secrets like that.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.905
Well, Amy told you
before us that
she was pregnant.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.041
True.
But that was bad news.

02:29.075 --> 02:31.843
This is what Amy would
consider good news.

02:31.878 --> 02:34.813
Well, I don't know
if consider it
good news or not.

02:34.847 --> 02:37.049
I really wanted
to be at her wedding.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.884
Since this doesn't
really involve me

02:38.918 --> 02:41.019
I'll just be
in my room.

02:41.054 --> 02:42.954
Nah. I think you've been
in your room enough.

02:42.989 --> 02:45.824
Where else am
I going to go?
I can't drive.

02:45.858 --> 02:47.826
Maybe if you
buy me a car,
I can get out more.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.028
Me? Oh, no.

02:50.063 --> 02:50.996
Maybe your
mother's next girlfriend
will buy you one.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.065
That's how things
are done in this family.

02:53.099 --> 02:54.132
Oh, ha ha.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.839
Ashley's up.
She doesn't know anything.

03:00.873 --> 03:03.809
How would she?
She's always in her room.

03:03.843 --> 03:07.045
We have to get
her out of her room.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.681
All I know is,
I want to be here when

03:09.715 --> 03:13.051
Amy and Ricky get home.
That's my son. I raised him.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.954
Well, I hatched him.

03:15.988 --> 03:18.924
Try staying off drugs
for nine months when
you're an addict.

03:18.958 --> 03:21.726
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean any offense.

03:21.761 --> 03:24.763
And not doing drugs
is hardly a sacrifice.

03:24.797 --> 03:29.801
I believe money from
the state was involved
during foster care, wasn't it?

03:29.836 --> 03:31.903
Like that covered
his expenses?

03:31.938 --> 03:34.739
And that stopped
when we adopted him.

03:34.774 --> 03:39.044
And my husband
is a heart surgeon.
So don't go there.

03:39.078 --> 03:41.012
I think what
we're all saying is

03:41.047 --> 03:43.849
that we've all
sacrificed a lot
for Ricky and Amy

03:43.883 --> 03:46.852
and we love them
and we should have been
a part of any wedding

03:46.886 --> 03:47.819
that took place.

03:54.827 --> 03:59.998
<i>â™ª Falling in love
is such an easy
thing to do</i>

04:00.032 --> 04:02.834
<i>â™ª Birds can do it
We can do it</i>

04:02.869 --> 04:05.070
<i>â™ª Let's stop talking
Let's get to it</i>

04:05.104 --> 04:08.974
<i>â™ª Let's fall in love</i>

04:09.008 --> 04:11.776
Wait. Both Ricky's
and your mother?

04:13.846 --> 04:16.882
Oh, my God!
Is it an intervention?

04:16.916 --> 04:19.851
Are we going to
talk to them or something?

04:19.886 --> 04:22.754
Oh, no.
call my mother, are they?

04:22.788 --> 04:24.923
I don't think
my mother even knows.

04:24.957 --> 04:26.791
I don't think
my dad told her.

04:28.027 --> 04:29.995
Did you
tell your mother?

04:30.029 --> 04:31.930
No. Why would
You're the girl.?

04:31.964 --> 04:34.699
There are two of us
in this relationship.

04:34.734 --> 04:37.769
Relationship. I like that.

04:37.803 --> 04:40.038
But guys
never tell anyone.

04:40.072 --> 04:43.041
Unless someone gets
or something. disease

04:43.075 --> 04:46.678
I told my dad,
tell your mom.ould

04:46.712 --> 04:48.680
If my mom
then I'll tell her.

04:48.714 --> 04:52.684
That would make us even.
for no reason.g her

04:52.718 --> 04:53.852
She thinks
we're best friends,

04:53.886 --> 04:55.754
that's why
if I stay over here.

04:55.788 --> 04:57.822
I don't want to get
her all involved.

04:58.758 --> 04:59.457
Wait.

04:59.492 --> 05:03.962
Did your dad
your mom or not?

05:03.996 --> 05:05.764
Does your mom know?

05:05.798 --> 05:08.667
I don't think
she does, no,

05:08.701 --> 05:09.868
and I don't
think he'll tell her.

05:09.902 --> 05:11.703
He's pretty good
at keeping secrets.

05:11.737 --> 05:12.637
Is he?
Yeah, he is.

05:12.672 --> 05:15.040
Are you sure about that?

05:15.074 --> 05:17.742
He just doesn't seem
something like this secret.

05:17.777 --> 05:19.978
You don't even know him.

05:20.012 --> 05:20.879
I got to know him
last night. better

05:20.913 --> 05:23.782
Did you know
that he lies?

05:23.816 --> 05:25.984
He's a very good liar.

05:26.018 --> 05:28.653
Well, not good really.

05:28.688 --> 05:31.022
Just frequent.

05:31.057 --> 05:33.692
He lies.
My sister lies.

05:33.726 --> 05:34.893
And I lie.

05:34.927 --> 05:39.064
No, no, you all
just have secrets.

05:39.098 --> 05:40.999
Secrets sounds
better than lies.

05:44.937 --> 05:46.905
And what secret
are you keeping?

05:46.939 --> 05:48.006
Or what lie
are you telling?

05:48.040 --> 05:50.041
Me?
Yeah. You.

05:50.076 --> 05:52.043
I'm not lying
when I say

05:53.713 --> 05:54.746
I love you.

06:01.887 --> 06:03.788
I'm going to
while I can.ere

06:03.823 --> 06:04.923
I'll text you.

06:11.030 --> 06:12.831
What time is it?

06:13.699 --> 06:14.766
Mmm.

06:18.804 --> 06:20.005
It's almost 11.

06:20.039 --> 06:22.641
We have to go,
dad in the kitchenr

06:22.675 --> 06:23.775
with those three
women all day.

06:23.809 --> 06:26.678
(SIGHS) No, we can.

06:26.812 --> 06:28.913
(CHUCKLES) He says
to take our time.

06:28.948 --> 06:31.850
And maybe if
we wait long enough,

06:31.884 --> 06:32.851
they'll all go get
waxed or something.

06:32.885 --> 06:34.986
(LAUGHS)

06:36.789 --> 06:39.758
I love my dad.
He's so funny.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.860
Yeah, well,
he's also so... So...

06:42.828 --> 06:44.029
We should go.

06:44.063 --> 06:47.766
No, we haven't slept in
since we had John.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.035
You've slept in,
you were in
New York for six weeks.

06:50.069 --> 06:51.836
You slept in when
you were with me
in New York.

06:51.871 --> 06:53.738
We stayed up all night.

06:53.773 --> 06:56.007
Oh. Right. (CHUCKLES)

06:56.042 --> 06:59.678
Well, come on.
We'll probably never
have a room like this again

06:59.712 --> 07:01.880
and we don't
have to leave, not yet.

07:01.914 --> 07:04.949
All right, we'll stay,
if that's what you want.

07:04.984 --> 07:06.051
That's what I want.

07:09.855 --> 07:11.690
It's just that
I'm not ready to

07:11.724 --> 07:12.891
go back to my house
and confront everyone.

07:12.925 --> 07:15.827
Part of the reason
I wanted to elope was

07:15.861 --> 07:18.697
because I'm tired
of everyone being
involved in our business.

07:19.932 --> 07:22.000
Yeah, well,
look at it as

07:22.034 --> 07:23.768
that's the price you pay
for being in a family.

07:23.803 --> 07:26.805
Yeah. But we should
make our own decisions.

07:26.839 --> 07:29.674
Well, since the first
decision we made together
led to our having John,

07:29.709 --> 07:31.743
there's probably
more involvement than
there would have been

07:31.777 --> 07:34.846
if things had
gone differently.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.782
Yeah, well, if things
had gone differently,
then I doubt we'd be here.

07:37.817 --> 07:41.720
We might.
And that's not the point.

07:41.754 --> 07:44.856
The point is
I love you, Amy.
And I love John.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.025
And I really
do want to be with you
for the rest of our lives.

07:50.796 --> 07:51.930
I know.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.800
And I love you too.

07:55.835 --> 07:59.003
It's just since
we made that first
decision by ourselves,

07:59.038 --> 07:59.938
we've grown up a lot

07:59.972 --> 08:03.007
and I'd like us to
make all our decisions

08:03.042 --> 08:04.909
from this point on
by ourselves

08:04.944 --> 08:06.711
without any of our
parents being involved.

08:08.647 --> 08:10.648
This was your father's idea.

08:10.683 --> 08:11.983
Hey, and mine too!

08:12.017 --> 08:13.985
I was the one who said
we should run off.

08:14.019 --> 08:15.854
Yeah, but he's
the one who kind of
made it happen.

08:15.888 --> 08:18.990
It's not always
a bad thing to have
our parents involved.

08:19.024 --> 08:20.825
I just don't like the
idea of our mothers

08:20.860 --> 08:23.995
sitting around
the kitchen table
talking about us

08:24.029 --> 08:26.798
and I feel like
we're being called into
the principal's office.

08:26.832 --> 08:28.700
Well, maybe they'll
be happy when we
tell them what we did.

08:28.734 --> 08:31.669
Believe me,
then they're just going to
want to plan a big wedding

08:31.704 --> 08:33.871
that everyone can come to.

08:33.905 --> 08:34.239
You don't know that.

08:34.273 --> 08:36.073
Yes, I do.

08:42.715 --> 08:44.949
Hey, Ben.
Adrian! What are
you doing here?

08:44.984 --> 08:46.885
Well, hello to you too.

08:46.919 --> 08:49.988
I'm sorry,
you just startled me.

08:50.022 --> 08:51.022
You are the nervous type.

08:52.057 --> 08:54.893
Am I? I like to
think of myself

08:54.927 --> 08:56.928
more as the
responsible type
than the nervous type.

08:56.962 --> 08:59.931
My dad came over
to see me last night,

08:59.965 --> 09:01.633
he brought me flowers
for my graduation.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.769
Oh? Oh, no.
Did I miss
your graduation?

09:04.804 --> 09:07.772
It wasn't
a real graduation.

09:07.807 --> 09:09.707
I just got
handed a diploma
in the counselor's office.

09:09.742 --> 09:11.776
And that was it.
Congratulations.

09:11.811 --> 09:14.846
And if I had known,
I would have
done something for you.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.815
(SCOFFS)
It's just high school.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.883
I'll be going to college,
it's not that big a deal.

09:20.786 --> 09:23.655
Did you come by for
something in particular?

09:23.689 --> 09:24.789
Not really.

09:25.891 --> 09:27.725
Grace broke up with me.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.828
Well, not that we
were together together,

09:29.862 --> 09:31.896
but she dumped me
as a friend

09:31.931 --> 09:33.865
and I just felt like
hanging out with someone.

09:33.899 --> 09:36.801
Hmm. Well, where's
that guy, Omar?

09:37.837 --> 09:39.637
He broke up with me, too.

09:39.672 --> 09:40.772
I could get him back,
but... Meh.

09:40.806 --> 09:42.874
I felt more like
hanging out with a friend.

09:42.908 --> 09:46.911
And you're my friend.
And just my friend.

09:46.946 --> 09:49.681
I'm your ex-husband,
I think I'm a little more
than just a friend.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.885
Ben, did you go
to my father and
ask him to talk to me?

09:54.920 --> 09:56.754
About what? No.

09:56.789 --> 09:59.691
You didn't ask him
to maybe talk to me

09:59.725 --> 10:01.893
about maybe getting back
together or something?

10:01.927 --> 10:03.962
No.
Why would I do that?
I'm with Dylan now.

10:03.996 --> 10:05.897
(SCOFFS) You can't be
serious about that girl.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.900
She's not for you.
She's not your type.

10:08.934 --> 10:11.769
Did my dad come to you
and ask you to talk to me?

10:11.804 --> 10:13.805
No.

10:13.839 --> 10:16.808
Well, you're not
my type either
but we were married.

10:16.842 --> 10:17.842
And now we're divorced
and now we're friends.

10:17.877 --> 10:21.646
Let's go back to
what your dad said.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.048
What exactly
did he say to you
that made you think

10:24.083 --> 10:26.985
I would want
to see you again,
as more than a friend?

10:27.019 --> 10:28.920
He just thinks
you're a nice guy.

10:28.954 --> 10:30.889
He thinks
you're too nice to be
with that pot smoker.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.891
What! How does
he know about that?

10:32.925 --> 10:34.993
How does
he know anything
about Dylan and me?

10:35.027 --> 10:38.696
I might have
mentioned it.

10:38.731 --> 10:39.797
Adrian!

10:39.832 --> 10:41.733
It was a long time ago.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.802
And he's my dad
and we talk. Sometimes.

10:44.837 --> 10:46.804
Look, he just
thinks a lot of you

10:46.839 --> 10:49.007
and the way
you handled everything
we went through,

10:49.041 --> 10:50.008
and well,
he kind of misses you.

10:50.042 --> 10:50.742
He misses me?

10:53.012 --> 10:54.812
Yeah. He said
you should come
around sometime.

10:54.847 --> 10:55.280
To his office or home?

10:55.314 --> 10:56.814
Doesn't matter.

10:56.849 --> 10:59.817
The important thing
is that you two

10:59.852 --> 11:02.787
are not trying
to get me to go
back with you.

11:02.821 --> 11:04.856
Yeah, that's really
the important thing.

11:05.958 --> 11:07.859
He said he misses me?
Yeah.

11:07.893 --> 11:11.696
And he wants me to
come around sometime?

11:11.730 --> 11:13.898
Is that he wants
me to come around
if I want to come around,

11:13.933 --> 11:16.968
or he's expecting me
to come around?

11:17.002 --> 11:19.771
I don't know.

11:19.805 --> 11:20.939
What's wrong with you?

11:20.973 --> 11:23.007
I'm trying to be nice here
and you're being all weird.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.876
Nothing is wrong with me.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.812
I'll go see him.
Good. Go see him.

11:27.846 --> 11:29.747
He said he'll be
around all day today.

11:33.296 --> 11:33.296
+

11:45.027 --> 11:46.994
Ben's father is here!

11:47.029 --> 11:48.863
Why?
I don't know!

11:49.198 --> 11:51.032
He didn't say?

11:51.066 --> 11:53.067
I didn't let him in.
He's knocking on the door.

11:53.101 --> 11:54.235
We could hide.

11:56.939 --> 11:58.206
Okay. I'll get it.

11:59.007 --> 12:00.041
Coming.

12:04.847 --> 12:05.947
Mind if I come in?

12:05.981 --> 12:07.782
No, not at all.

12:07.816 --> 12:09.917
After all, we just
showed up at your house.

12:09.952 --> 12:13.054
But just that one time.
Or maybe it was twice.

12:13.088 --> 12:15.957
Do you like cinnamon
streusel pound cake?
I just made one.

12:15.991 --> 12:17.091
I'll take it to go.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.993
Oh. All right.

12:19.027 --> 12:21.062
I'm joking.
I just want to talk
to the two of you.

12:21.096 --> 12:24.098
Sure. Sit down.
I know what
this is about.

12:24.132 --> 12:25.933
I don't.

12:25.968 --> 12:27.835
Then maybe
you shouldn't
involve yourself.

12:27.870 --> 12:28.903
Well, if it's
about my daughter,
I want to be involved.

12:29.171 --> 12:31.939
You know what?

12:31.974 --> 12:35.042
Why don't you
talk to Dylan
while I talk to Leo.

12:35.077 --> 12:36.110
Why would I do that?

12:36.144 --> 12:38.112
I can talk to Dylan
after the three of us talk.

12:38.146 --> 12:40.081
Please.
Really?

12:40.115 --> 12:42.917
Really. It's business.

12:42.951 --> 12:47.154
It's business that I imagine
involves my business.

12:47.189 --> 12:49.123
You know what,
I don't even want
to be here.

12:55.063 --> 12:56.998
So what do you
know about the fire?

12:57.032 --> 12:58.065
I like the direct approach.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.836
I know all
anyone can know.

13:01.870 --> 13:05.006
The fire started in the lab
and caused an explosion.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.010
No one was hurt
because no one was in
the building at the time.

13:09.044 --> 13:13.014
The guard was where he was
supposed to be, outside.

13:13.048 --> 13:16.150
And the kids had
come by hours earlier.

13:16.184 --> 13:19.954
There is nothing
linking either of them
to that fire.

13:19.988 --> 13:24.025
So go home and
don't worry about it.

13:24.059 --> 13:26.127
Whenever people
tell me not to be
worried about something,

13:26.161 --> 13:27.895
I get worried.

13:27.930 --> 13:30.064
Yeah, your son's
a worrier, too.

13:30.098 --> 13:31.866
Were they in the lab?

13:31.900 --> 13:34.969
They were
all over the school,
she gave him a tour.

13:35.003 --> 13:37.838
No one is accusing
them of anything,

13:37.873 --> 13:39.206
it's not being
treated as arson.

13:39.241 --> 13:40.908
What were they
doing in the lab?

13:40.943 --> 13:42.877
Who knows?
There are no cameras.

13:42.911 --> 13:44.979
The cameras are
at t entrances,

13:45.013 --> 13:48.082
they don't have cameras
in each classroom.

13:48.116 --> 13:51.152
If they did,
I'd be a wealthier man.

13:51.186 --> 13:53.955
They were
roasting marshmallows
over a Bunsen burner.

13:53.989 --> 13:55.056
What?
Yeah.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.991
And an hour later, boom,

13:57.025 --> 13:59.794
the lab blows up
and the school burns down.

13:59.828 --> 14:03.064
And you're not worried.
Why is that?

14:03.098 --> 14:04.065
Because how do
you know they were

14:04.099 --> 14:07.835
roasting marshmallows
over a Bunsen burner?

14:07.869 --> 14:10.805
I overheard a conversation.

14:10.839 --> 14:12.974
Well, maybe you
overheard wrong.

14:13.008 --> 14:16.844
If Jack doesn't
know anything then
Grace doesn't know anything,

14:16.878 --> 14:18.079
and if Grace
doesn't know anything

14:18.113 --> 14:20.014
then Adrian doesn't
know anything.

14:20.048 --> 14:22.917
So Ben isn't
talking to Adrian.

14:22.951 --> 14:24.852
I didn't think he would.

14:24.886 --> 14:27.888
Maybe he did talk to Adrian
but Adrian didn't say
anything to Grace,

14:27.923 --> 14:29.156
so Grace didn't say
anything to Jack.

14:29.191 --> 14:31.125
Oh, come on,
she would say something.

14:31.159 --> 14:32.093
You know how gossip
flies in that circle.

14:32.127 --> 14:34.128
Like wildfire?

14:34.162 --> 14:35.997
It's not funny.

14:36.031 --> 14:37.999
Ben is so worried
he wants to break up with me.

14:38.033 --> 14:39.900
Oh! Yay!

14:39.935 --> 14:41.135
What?

14:41.169 --> 14:43.838
I mean, he's great
for a starter boyfriend,

14:43.872 --> 14:45.039
but you cannot keep
him as a real boyfriend.
He's a dork.

14:45.073 --> 14:48.776
I beg your pardon.
He is not a dork.

14:48.810 --> 14:50.144
Okay, he's not a dork.
He's a rich dork.
You can do better.

14:50.178 --> 14:54.148
I don't want
to do better,
I love him.

14:54.182 --> 14:57.118
Well, I can't
keep dating Jack
to get information.

14:57.152 --> 14:59.220
I don't love him.
I don't love him at all.

15:00.022 --> 15:01.956
I mean he's hot,

15:01.990 --> 15:04.025
not so hot he'd
make a lab explode and
burn down a school, but...

15:04.059 --> 15:06.827
Okay, would you drop
the fire references?

15:06.862 --> 15:08.095
Fine. Can you
just forget Ben?

15:08.130 --> 15:10.031
Forget him?
Fine. Marry him.

15:10.065 --> 15:11.999
Then you
can't testify
against each other.

15:12.034 --> 15:14.902
It's never going
to get to that,
to our testifying.

15:14.936 --> 15:16.737
This is never
going to go to court.

15:16.772 --> 15:18.005
My father would
never let that happen.

15:19.941 --> 15:20.975
Hi.

15:21.009 --> 15:22.043
I'll be right back.

15:22.077 --> 15:24.078
Where are you going?

15:24.112 --> 15:25.146
To the bathroom.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.014
No, you can't.
We have company.

15:27.049 --> 15:28.082
So I'll just
go home and go
to the bathroom then.

15:28.116 --> 15:30.051
You can't do that either.
Just stay in here.

15:30.085 --> 15:32.920
I'll let you know
when you can come out.
Cross your legs.

15:35.791 --> 15:36.724
What is going on?

15:36.758 --> 15:39.126
Your boyfriend's father
is in the kitchen.

15:39.161 --> 15:41.829
Leo Boykewich
is in our kitchen?

15:41.863 --> 15:44.799
<i>That's the one.
He's talking to your father.
Mano a mano.</i>

15:44.833 --> 15:47.101
About what?
You tell me.

15:47.969 --> 15:49.904
Or you.

15:49.938 --> 15:52.807
Uh, now,
I really have to go.

15:52.841 --> 15:54.108
Talk to you later, Dylan.

15:56.178 --> 15:58.879
It's about that
stupid fire, isn't it?

15:58.914 --> 15:59.947
Probably. They sent
me out of the room.

15:59.981 --> 16:02.883
Mom!

16:02.918 --> 16:03.851
You should have
stayed in the room
and stood up for me!

16:03.885 --> 16:06.921
For Ben and me!
We didn't do anything.

16:06.955 --> 16:09.990
Of course not.
You're a very
conscientious young lady.

16:10.025 --> 16:11.725
I'm sure you
left the school
just as you found it.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.894
We did! I swear!

16:13.929 --> 16:15.062
You didn't go in
the lab for anything?

16:15.097 --> 16:18.899
We walked by it,
we stuck our head
in the door.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.802
We didn't do
anything that would
cause an explosion.

16:21.837 --> 16:22.970
If we did,
I would tell you.

16:23.004 --> 16:26.040
I know,
you're pretty good
about telling me things,

16:26.074 --> 16:28.075
except maybe
about the pot.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.010
You weren't smoking pot
in there, were you, Dylan?

16:30.045 --> 16:31.846
Mom!

16:31.880 --> 16:33.147
At school?
With all those
cameras around?

16:33.181 --> 16:36.851
What about
not at school where there
are no cameras around,

16:36.885 --> 16:37.952
are you still
smoking pot?

16:37.986 --> 16:39.820
No.

16:39.855 --> 16:41.956
Where would I get pot?

16:41.990 --> 16:45.960
Mercedes' mother is dead,
they don't give pot
prescriptions to dead people.

16:45.994 --> 16:49.830
It's such a shame
about her mom.
How's Mercedes doing?

16:49.865 --> 16:51.966
Her and her dad
aren't still smoking
whatever pot was left?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.769
No. There's no pot left.

16:55.804 --> 16:56.971
They're going
to counseling now.

16:57.005 --> 16:58.739
And no one
is smoking pot.

16:58.773 --> 17:01.876
Not them. Not Ben. Not me.

17:04.045 --> 17:06.946
I'll talk to Dylan
and ask her
about this alleged

17:06.982 --> 17:09.782
Bunsen burner business

17:09.818 --> 17:12.987
and if it's relevant
to the investigation
I'll let the police know.

17:13.021 --> 17:14.688
Will you?
I said I would.

17:14.723 --> 17:15.723
Then I imagine,
if you do that,

17:15.790 --> 17:16.991
then the police
are going to want
to talto Ben.

17:17.025 --> 17:18.925
I know that, so...

17:18.960 --> 17:22.829
Are you sure
this is something you
want me to say now?

17:22.864 --> 17:25.900
If I give the police
an excuse to blame
this on our children,

17:25.934 --> 17:28.669
they might just do that.

17:28.703 --> 17:30.104
Why don't we just
let this play itself out,

17:30.972 --> 17:32.940
see how it goes.

17:32.974 --> 17:36.677
Do you want
Ben to go to prison for
something he didn't do?

17:36.711 --> 17:37.945
He wouldn't last
two minutes in prison.

17:37.979 --> 17:39.747
Oh, and Dylan would?

17:39.814 --> 17:42.816
Dylan,
I remind you, is not 18.
I believe your son is.

17:42.851 --> 17:44.885
Then again, it could
have been Dylan who started
the fire and not Ben.

17:44.920 --> 17:48.989
I seriously doubt
Ben lit the Bunsen burner
and roasted the marshmallows.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.859
He doesn't cook.

17:51.893 --> 17:53.761
Never has.

17:53.795 --> 17:55.729
Yeah, but apparently
he likes playing
with matches.

17:55.764 --> 17:56.897
He smokes pot.
Once.

17:56.932 --> 17:58.866
That's what they all say.

17:58.900 --> 17:59.767
No one gets
caught the first time.

18:01.736 --> 18:01.769
Almost no one.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.742
If someone had eaten
a rancid steak from
Boykewich International,

18:08.777 --> 18:10.711
you'd know how to
handle that, right?

18:10.745 --> 18:13.647
Well this is my territory,
this is security.

18:13.682 --> 18:16.050
I know what to do here.
We wait this out.

18:21.756 --> 18:25.726
We do not
have rancid steak

18:25.760 --> 18:26.727
at Boykewich International.

18:30.447 --> 18:30.447
+

18:47.678 --> 18:48.678
Ethan?

18:49.713 --> 18:50.613
It's Ethan, right?

18:50.647 --> 18:54.784
Yeah. You're Ben?
Ben Boykewich?

18:54.818 --> 18:56.752
That's your house?

18:56.787 --> 18:59.355
I thought
you had money.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.690
That's Adrian's parents' house

19:00.724 --> 19:03.592
and anyone
who still has a house
in this economy has money.

19:03.627 --> 19:06.562
What are you
doing out here?

19:06.596 --> 19:10.733
Oh. Big pow wow
with Ricky's mothers and
Amy's mother and her dad.

19:10.767 --> 19:13.602
His mother is
my foster mother, Margaret.

19:13.637 --> 19:16.405
She dragged me here,
I'm not allowed to
be home alone.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.708
And what is this
pow wow about?

19:18.742 --> 19:21.610

19:21.645 --> 19:24.413
I begged her to
let me stay out here,

19:24.448 --> 19:26.415

family dramas after what
I've been through, you know.

19:27.718 --> 19:29.652
Is Amy okay?

19:29.686 --> 19:32.655
Like I told you,
I don't really know.

19:32.689 --> 19:35.424
I think maybe
she and Ricky
eloped last night.

19:35.459 --> 19:38.427
You think
maybe they eloped?

19:38.462 --> 19:41.430
What?
Yeah. Maybe.

19:41.465 --> 19:42.665
And that's why
everyone is here?

19:42.699 --> 19:44.800
That's why
everyone is here.

They're waiting for
them to come by and get
the kid and find out.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.774
Kind of ambush them.
Or surprise them
or something.

19:51.808 --> 19:55.511
Something like?
Are they having
a reception or anything?

19:55.545 --> 19:56.779

You know, like a party.

19:56.813 --> 20:01.550
For when they get home
from their stupid wedding.

I don't even know why
I'm even asking you about it,

20:03.453 --> 20:06.655

I'm well, thank you.
And you?

20:34.718 --> 20:36.485
You already
asked me that.

And...

You look a little pale.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.796

20:46.830 --> 20:48.631
Amy and Ricky eloped.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.766
No kidding. Huh.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.468
I kind of
thought they might.

20:52.502 --> 20:52.535
I didn't.

20:54.571 --> 20:56.539
Well, uh, sit down.

20:56.873 --> 20:57.873

treating you?

21:12.556 --> 21:14.824
Fine. How's Kathleen?

21:15.759 --> 21:17.693
Fine.

21:17.727 --> 21:19.495
Please tell me that
you didn't tell her

21:19.529 --> 21:20.963
that we think
Amy and Ricky
ran off and got married.

21:20.997 --> 21:22.765
I didn't tell her that
we think Amy and Ricky
ran off and got married.

21:22.799 --> 21:25.434
Good.

21:25.469 --> 21:26.535
Because no one
should know until we know.

21:26.570 --> 21:28.571
We should be
the first to know.

21:28.605 --> 21:30.506
I doubt we'll be
the first to know
if they got married.

21:30.540 --> 21:31.674
I'm sure Amy's
going to tell Madison
and Lauren before us.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.642
She better not.

21:33.677 --> 21:34.743
I don't know for sure
she'll tell them,
I'm just guessing.

21:34.778 --> 21:36.512
Based on what
you and I did.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.514
You and I ran off
and didn't get married.

21:38.548 --> 21:39.582
We did the second
time we ran off.

21:40.617 --> 21:42.651
Yeah.
"Yeah."

21:42.686 --> 21:44.487
You didn't think
it was so "yeah"
when we got married.

21:44.521 --> 21:46.455
You were excited about it.
Or so I thought.

21:46.490 --> 21:47.756

21:47.791 --> 21:50.759
Oop. Somebody's
up from their nap.
I'll go check on Robie.

21:50.794 --> 21:53.629
Yeah, you should
go check on Robie.
He's your kid too, you know.

21:53.663 --> 21:55.431
Didn't you just
leave Robie with me

21:55.465 --> 21:56.765
when you went
gallivanting off in
gay Paris?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.534
Shut up.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.703
Nice. Don't forget
we have company.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.471
Are they like that
all the time?

22:03.707 --> 22:06.709
Pretty much. Yeah.

22:06.743 --> 22:11.480
Well, it's probably a good
thing they are already
divorced and living apart.

22:11.515 --> 22:15.451
That constant bickering
is not good for children.

22:15.485 --> 22:19.588
I hope Amy
is not going to be
like that with our Ricky.

22:19.623 --> 22:20.389

You know,
I don't know

22:25.529 --> 22:29.698
if it's a good idea
for John to be around
George and Anne so often.

22:29.733 --> 22:32.501
I mean, I'm going
to talk to Ricky

22:32.536 --> 22:34.603
about leaving him
with me more often.

22:34.638 --> 22:38.541

and he just crumpled
onto the floor.

23:06.622 --> 23:07.589
He doesn't want me
to call his dad.

23:07.623 --> 23:08.857
And he's over 18, so...

29:04.354 --> 29:06.355
I just said
I'm happy for you.

29:06.390 --> 29:08.291
I was talking to Amy.

29:08.325 --> 29:11.294
Well, I'm gonna say
what I want to say
when I want to say it.

29:11.328 --> 29:12.595
Then fine, just tell us.

29:12.629 --> 29:15.431
I think we should wait.

29:15.466 --> 29:18.201
And before you
say anything Amy,

29:18.235 --> 29:19.435
I'm not going to say
what I don't want to say
when I don't want to say it.

29:23.340 --> 29:25.241
You're having sex
with Toby?

29:25.275 --> 29:27.376
Yeah.
Never mind that now,
Ricky and Amy are home.

29:27.411 --> 29:28.478
Well, Ricky and Amy
can wait.

29:28.512 --> 29:29.612
They've kept us
waiting all day.

29:29.646 --> 29:31.347
Right now I want
to talk to Ashley.

29:31.381 --> 29:32.348
There's really
nothing more
to talk about.

29:34.451 --> 29:35.418
I'm on the pill,
we use condoms,

29:35.452 --> 29:38.488
and we're in love
as much as anyone else.

29:38.522 --> 29:38.855
But I thought
you were going to wait.

29:38.889 --> 29:41.524
Yeah, so?

29:41.558 --> 29:43.359
I thought
you were straight.
Things change.

29:43.393 --> 29:44.627
Don't do that.

29:44.661 --> 29:46.362
Don't use whatever
your mother is going through

29:46.396 --> 29:47.430
as your excuse to
do what you're doing.

29:47.464 --> 29:48.531
If you think you're
doing the right thing

29:48.565 --> 29:50.433
then you don't
need an excuse.

29:50.467 --> 29:51.534
But I suspect
you don't think you're
doing the right thing,

29:51.568 --> 29:53.302
which is why Toby
came and talked to me
and not you.

29:53.337 --> 29:54.570
Well, no one talked to me.

29:54.605 --> 29:56.506
Why didn't you
talk to me about it?

29:56.540 --> 29:57.540
I thought we could
talk about anything.

29:58.475 --> 30:00.409
Is it because I'm gay?

30:00.444 --> 30:02.545
You don't want
to talk to me about sex
now because I'm gay?

30:02.579 --> 30:04.480
I didn't say that.

30:04.515 --> 30:07.617
I just said
that things change.

30:07.651 --> 30:09.385
I just decided
that I wanted to
have sex with Toby,

30:09.419 --> 30:10.520
so I did.

30:10.554 --> 30:12.522
Why?
I just felt like it.

30:12.556 --> 30:14.524
ANNE: But I thought
you two were friends

30:14.558 --> 30:15.391
and that you
wanted to wait until
you were in love

30:15.425 --> 30:17.460
and it would
really mean something.

30:17.494 --> 30:19.562
Hello. I said
I've changed my mind.

30:19.596 --> 30:21.597
He's a nice guy, Ashley,
but you're too young.

30:21.632 --> 30:22.465
You're too young to
be out of high school,

30:22.499 --> 30:24.433
you're too young to
be out on the road,

30:24.501 --> 30:25.635
traveling all over
the country,

30:25.669 --> 30:26.536
you're too young to have
all the freedom you have.

30:26.570 --> 30:30.406
Okay before you
say anything else...

30:30.440 --> 30:32.542
Ashley, do you remember
that cooking school
you applied to in Italy?

30:32.576 --> 30:33.009
Yeah?
No!

30:33.043 --> 30:35.278
You got accepted.

30:35.312 --> 30:36.445
No, you can't go to Italy.
You don't have any money.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.013
And you're not
giving her any.

30:37.047 --> 30:38.548
Toby would love Italy.

30:41.585 --> 30:45.521
I told you that
I would talk to you
if she got in.

30:45.556 --> 30:47.323
Why didn't you
tell me about Toby?

30:47.357 --> 30:49.192
Because there were
other things going on.

30:49.226 --> 30:50.393
You and your girlfriends
have been busy all day

30:50.427 --> 30:52.261
guessing whether or not
Amy and Ricky are married.

30:52.296 --> 30:53.362
Okay, well,
let's go find out,

30:53.397 --> 30:55.431
we can talk
about Ashley later.

30:55.499 --> 30:56.599
I want to talk
about her now.

30:56.633 --> 30:58.334
Now I don't feel like it.

30:58.368 --> 30:59.402
Do we always have to
do what you want to do?

31:00.571 --> 31:04.407
What is taking so long?

31:04.441 --> 31:06.375
I think I know
but I can't say.

31:06.410 --> 31:07.543
What can't you say?

31:07.578 --> 31:10.179
Uh, I can't say.

31:10.214 --> 31:11.480
Why would you say
you can't say

31:11.515 --> 31:14.383
so we all know
you know something?
You know something.

31:14.418 --> 31:17.320
I can't say.

31:17.354 --> 31:20.289
All righty, well, I'm going
to call the hospital

31:20.324 --> 31:22.425
while we're waiting
and see how Ben is.

31:22.459 --> 31:24.260
Uh, this would be
an awkward time

31:24.294 --> 31:25.561
to be calling Ben,
don't you think?

31:25.596 --> 31:27.363
Don't you want to
know if he's okay?

31:27.397 --> 31:28.331
Do you? Do you want
to know if he's okay?

31:28.365 --> 31:31.400
Yeah. I kind of
want to knowow.

31:31.435 --> 31:33.369
I mean
a brain aneurysm
or a heart attack,

31:33.403 --> 31:34.237
they're both pretty serious.

31:34.271 --> 31:37.206
He fainted.
He fainted?

31:37.241 --> 31:38.474
And they took him
to the hospital?

31:38.508 --> 31:41.210
Well, that's not
what Ethan said.

31:41.245 --> 31:45.214
Well, Ethan is not always
a reliable source
of information.

31:45.249 --> 31:46.415
Is he still
sitting in the car?

31:46.450 --> 31:48.451
If he hasn't sold it.

31:48.485 --> 31:51.187
Why couldn't you
just leave him at home?

31:51.221 --> 31:54.257
Alone in my house?
What would be
the lesson in that?

31:54.291 --> 31:56.492
The lesson
in this is that since
he can't be trusted,

31:56.526 --> 31:57.426
he goes
everywhere with me.

31:57.461 --> 32:00.229
Where's Dad?
Shouldn't he be here?

32:00.264 --> 32:02.331
Should he?

32:02.366 --> 32:03.499
He's at
a medical convention.

32:03.533 --> 32:04.800
And he's waiting
to hear from me.

32:04.835 --> 32:09.338
And I can't wait
much longer to hear
the big news from you.

32:09.373 --> 32:12.408
Come on, just tell us.
We'll act surprised when
you tell Anne and George.

32:13.277 --> 32:14.377
Nice, Nora.

32:14.411 --> 32:15.511
Okay, can we
do this now?

32:15.545 --> 32:17.346
Where's Ashley?

32:17.381 --> 32:17.913
Oh, come on,
we're not going to
wait for Ashley.

32:17.948 --> 32:20.316
Ashley and Toby are...

32:21.418 --> 32:22.585
They're sleeping together.

32:22.619 --> 32:25.321
Right now?
Not right now. Geez.

32:25.355 --> 32:27.590
I thought she had
been having sex with
Toby for a long time.

32:27.624 --> 32:32.361
Please, can you
discuss Ashley and Toby
some other time?

32:32.396 --> 32:34.530
We have been waiting
all day. Speak!

32:34.564 --> 32:36.432
No. First,
I want to speak.

32:36.466 --> 32:37.500
Do you have to?

32:37.534 --> 32:39.235
Thursday night,

32:39.269 --> 32:42.505
I offered to babysit John
if Ricky and Amy wanted
to go get married.

32:42.539 --> 32:44.173
And I offered
to pay for that.

32:44.207 --> 32:45.274
For them to elope,
stay in a hotel,

32:45.309 --> 32:47.343
whatever they
wanted to do. Ow!

32:47.377 --> 32:48.377
You knew this?

32:48.412 --> 32:50.479
No, I knew
the other thing.

32:50.514 --> 32:53.349
You knew about
Ashley and Toby?
I'm sorry.

32:53.383 --> 32:56.252
All right, time for
Amy and me to say
what we have to say.

32:56.286 --> 32:57.486
No, I'm not
done yet.

32:57.521 --> 32:59.388
I don't want anyone
to say anything
to either one of you

32:59.423 --> 33:01.590
about doing the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

33:01.625 --> 33:04.293
I'm proud of you both.

33:04.328 --> 33:07.330
I was proud of you, Amy,
when you went right back to
school after John was born

33:07.364 --> 33:08.497
and you caught up
with all your classes

33:08.532 --> 33:10.333
and you took that
job at the nursery

33:10.367 --> 33:12.535
and when you
took responsibility
for raising your son.

33:12.569 --> 33:14.603
You're a good mother.

33:14.638 --> 33:17.273
And Ricky, I never thought
I'd be saying this to you,

33:17.307 --> 33:18.407
but you're a good father.

33:19.276 --> 33:21.243
And a good man.

33:21.278 --> 33:23.446
Lot of men
in your situation not only
don't take care of the kid,

33:23.480 --> 33:25.448
they don't take care
of the mother who's
taking care of the kid.

33:27.351 --> 33:28.517
We've always
loved you, Amy,

33:28.552 --> 33:30.219
even when
you got pregnant,
we still loved you.

33:30.253 --> 33:32.221
And we love you now.

33:32.255 --> 33:33.356
Aw, Dad, I love you too.

33:33.390 --> 33:37.159
I'm not done here.
We love you, Ricky.

33:37.194 --> 33:38.294
And we love your son
and our grandson.

33:40.397 --> 33:42.565
We're family.
All of us here are family.

33:42.599 --> 33:44.533
And as coo coo
a family as we are,

33:44.568 --> 33:46.569
we love each other.

33:46.603 --> 33:51.374
Yeah, Margaret,
I even love you.
And you, Nora. And Anne.

33:51.408 --> 33:53.442
And as much as
we've all screwed up,

33:53.477 --> 33:55.478
we still managed
to make a couple of
good human beings,

33:55.512 --> 33:58.614
and that's as much as
any parent can hope for.

33:58.648 --> 34:01.250
Thank you. The end.
Yeah, the end.

34:01.284 --> 34:02.618
Maybe we'd all like
to say something, too.

34:02.652 --> 34:05.621
I don't want anyone
saying anything to these
two brave people.

34:05.655 --> 34:08.290
Amy and Ricky,
it takes guts to
make a commitment,

34:08.324 --> 34:09.125
even if you
did it in secret.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.626
So we missed
the wedding, so what?

34:10.659 --> 34:13.596
This is not about us,
it's about them,
Ricky and Amy.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.297
And I'm sorry
if you think I did
the wrong thing, but I don't.

34:16.333 --> 34:17.400
My Amy deserves
to be married,

34:17.434 --> 34:18.501
she deserves to
have a husband

34:18.534 --> 34:20.402
and John deserves to
have married parents.

34:23.373 --> 34:24.373
So...

34:25.675 --> 34:27.510
We...

34:30.480 --> 34:31.679
...got married.

34:39.833 --> 34:39.833
+

34:45.925 --> 34:46.358
Ashley, where were you?

34:46.458 --> 34:47.525
Come in the house.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.527
Ricky and Amy
just told us
they got married.

34:48.561 --> 34:49.261
No, you go.
I don't really
feel like it.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.161
(SIGHS)
Well I don't either,

34:50.196 --> 34:51.563
but we should be
in there celebrating.

34:51.598 --> 34:51.929
Celebrating that
she's married and she's
a senior in high school?

34:52.031 --> 34:53.532
Mom, really.

34:53.565 --> 34:53.866
I don't like her that much
but I hate to see her
married in high school.

35:06.300 --> 35:07.066
I do, too!

35:07.167 --> 35:08.401
If they were
going to get married,

35:08.435 --> 35:09.802
I think they should have
at least waited
until they were

35:09.837 --> 35:10.837
out of high school,
or college even.

35:10.871 --> 35:12.839
So she has a baby,
so what?

35:12.873 --> 35:15.041
Doesn't mean
she has to be married.

35:15.075 --> 35:17.844
No one has to be married.
I should have been there.

35:17.878 --> 35:19.746
Mimsy wasn't
at your wedding.

35:19.780 --> 35:21.047
Yeah, and looking
at her now,

35:21.081 --> 35:23.016
all the things
I could have done better,

35:23.050 --> 35:24.918
all the times
I could have been nicer,

35:24.952 --> 35:28.855
not having her at my wedding
is at the top of the list.

35:28.889 --> 35:30.990
No offense, but you
couldn't have fixed that

35:31.025 --> 35:32.725
by taking her
to Amy's wedding.

35:32.760 --> 35:33.960
I know that.

35:33.994 --> 35:37.864
But I know now
how she felt being
left out of mine.

35:39.800 --> 35:42.635
Why didn't you have her
at your wedding?

35:42.670 --> 35:45.905
I don't know,
we were pregnant,
then we ran off

35:45.940 --> 35:48.641
and didn't get married
and lied about it.

35:48.676 --> 35:50.610
When we finally
made good on it,

35:50.644 --> 35:52.612
we couldn't go back
and tell her that we'd lied
and take her with us.

35:52.646 --> 35:53.913
Why not?

35:53.948 --> 35:54.881
Because no one wants
to tell their parents

35:54.915 --> 35:56.816
they lied about
something like that.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.751
Tell her now.

35:58.786 --> 35:59.953
She doesn't even
know who I am now.

36:00.955 --> 36:03.890
Well, hey,

36:03.924 --> 36:05.692
none of us knew
who you were
until a week ago.

36:07.761 --> 36:09.662
It's all going
to be all right, Mom.

36:09.697 --> 36:11.798
Especially if I go to
cooking school in Italy.

36:11.832 --> 36:14.968
Ashley,
if you do go to
cooking school in Italy,

36:15.002 --> 36:16.669
why don't you
go by yourself?

36:16.704 --> 36:17.570
I don't mean
live by yourself,

36:17.604 --> 36:20.807
but just go over
and live with a family

36:20.841 --> 36:23.876
or maybe get an apartment
with another girl who's
going to school there.

36:23.911 --> 36:25.845
But I think Toby is
going to want to go.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.747
Really?

36:27.781 --> 36:30.683
Toby is going
to want to follow you
to Italy to cooking school?

36:30.718 --> 36:31.884
Well, yeah.
I just slept with him.

36:34.888 --> 36:38.624
Well, that was
a nice little speech
George made.

36:38.659 --> 36:41.828
Yeah, who knew
George was capable of
telling you he loves you?

36:41.862 --> 36:44.697
Yeah, that was sweet.

36:44.732 --> 36:46.899
But what he said
to you and Amy
was even sweeter.

36:48.035 --> 36:49.869
Aw, Ricky.

36:50.971 --> 36:53.673
You're married.

36:54.942 --> 36:56.976
How does it feel?

36:57.011 --> 36:59.879
I don't know,
it feels just like
not being married.

36:59.913 --> 37:02.782
Hey, are you going
to have a reception?
A what?

37:02.816 --> 37:04.717
Well, you got to have
some kind of party.

37:04.752 --> 37:05.685
I think that was
the point in eloping.

37:05.719 --> 37:07.987
Not having
any kind of party.

37:08.022 --> 37:10.690
I know, but...

37:10.724 --> 37:11.958
I don't think
Anne is happy.

37:11.992 --> 37:14.027
Yeah, well,
George is happy enough
for the both of them.

37:14.061 --> 37:15.962
You know,
Anne'll get over it,

37:15.996 --> 37:18.731
she's just
in a vulnerable
place right now.

37:18.766 --> 37:19.899
And if she
doesn't get over it,

37:19.933 --> 37:21.868
maybe you and Amy could
have a big formal wedding,

37:21.902 --> 37:23.970
you know where
everyone can come.

37:24.004 --> 37:26.639
What? That would be
a complete waste of money.

37:26.673 --> 37:28.708
I know, but...

37:28.742 --> 37:30.810
Anne's going to think
you didn't have a wedding

37:30.844 --> 37:34.947
because you
don't want her there
because she's gay.

37:34.982 --> 37:36.716
Did she say that?
Yeah.

37:36.750 --> 37:37.884
Well, that's not the reason.

37:37.918 --> 37:39.952
What happened to
the fourth of July?

37:39.987 --> 37:42.922
I don't know,
this was spur of the
moment, it was fun.

37:42.956 --> 37:45.792
George didn't push you
into this, did he?

37:45.826 --> 37:47.593
No, no, he didn't.

37:47.628 --> 37:48.828
Amy told me
she wanted to elope

37:48.862 --> 37:52.832
and she hinted
that to George
and he jumped on it.

37:52.866 --> 37:54.901
So this was Amy's idea.

37:56.637 --> 37:57.703
Doesn't matter.

37:57.738 --> 37:58.805
BOTH: Yes, it does.

38:04.645 --> 38:07.980
I'm just glad
the guy finally made
an honest woman out of you.

38:08.048 --> 38:11.751
Dad, that's not
politically correct.

38:13.687 --> 38:14.687
But thanks, I guess.

38:16.857 --> 38:19.826
Look...
I, uh...

38:19.860 --> 38:21.661
I feel bad
that everyone
isn't quite on board,

38:21.695 --> 38:23.696
but that's how it goes.

38:24.765 --> 38:27.800
And your mother
will get over it.

38:27.835 --> 38:29.702
I think she thinks
you didn't have a wedding

38:29.736 --> 38:31.904
because you didn't want
her to bring a date or
something crazy like that.

38:31.939 --> 38:35.575
Maybe I didn't want
you to bring a date.

38:35.609 --> 38:37.777
Really?
You don't like Kathleen?

38:37.811 --> 38:40.713
No, no, I like her,

38:40.747 --> 38:43.883
but Dad,
honestly, a wedding?

38:43.917 --> 38:46.819
With Mom and her date
and you and your date,

38:46.854 --> 38:49.722
no matter who
either of you bring,
it would just be awkward.

38:49.756 --> 38:50.590
And then there's
my group of friends,

38:50.624 --> 38:54.627
Ben and his new girlfriend,

38:54.661 --> 38:56.596
Adrian and
whoever she's with,

38:56.630 --> 38:59.665
Grace and Jack
and Jack and Madison
and... (SCOFFS)

38:59.700 --> 39:00.700
I just started
thinking about it

39:00.734 --> 39:02.768
and my wedding should be
about me and my date.

39:02.803 --> 39:04.570
And it was.

39:04.605 --> 39:05.771
Yeah.

39:05.806 --> 39:07.740
I'm very proud
of you. And Ricky.

39:07.774 --> 39:07.840
Thanks.

39:10.744 --> 39:13.613
And thank you
for saying all those
nice things about us.

39:13.647 --> 39:15.648
Meant every word I said.

39:15.682 --> 39:17.817
And here's
something I didn't say.

39:17.851 --> 39:21.621
Being a teenage mother
is still frowned upon
in this country.

39:21.655 --> 39:23.623
People accept
that it happens

39:23.657 --> 39:24.724
but people judge
everyone involved
when it happens.

39:24.758 --> 39:26.759
People look at you,
they see the kid,

39:26.793 --> 39:29.562
they see you don't have
a ring on your finger,

39:29.596 --> 39:31.564
they judge you,
and they judge Ricky,

39:31.598 --> 39:32.865
and they feel
sorry for John.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.801
And as your father,
that hurts me.

39:35.836 --> 39:37.670
And this
doesn't take away
any of the indignities

39:37.704 --> 39:39.906
you've suffered over
the past few years,

39:39.940 --> 39:41.941
but it makes life better,

39:41.975 --> 39:43.910
for you and your husband

39:43.944 --> 39:46.012
and your family
and our family.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.916
Aw, Dad, I know.

39:51.818 --> 39:53.920
And I know that I have
caused you a lot of trouble

39:53.954 --> 39:55.888
and a lot of
heartache, but...

39:55.923 --> 39:58.824
But today is a new day.

39:58.859 --> 40:01.794
Yesterday was the
first day of the rest of
your life, Mrs. Underwood.

40:01.828 --> 40:02.995
(CHUCKLING)

40:07.734 --> 40:10.736
Let's go.
The doctor said there's
nothing wrong with you.

40:12.039 --> 40:13.906
Not buying it, Ben.

40:15.876 --> 40:19.745
I don't
feel very well.
I collapsed.

40:19.780 --> 40:20.880
At what point
in the conversation
did you collapse?

40:20.914 --> 40:23.015
Before or after
a confession?

40:27.054 --> 40:28.921
We didn't really talk.

40:28.956 --> 40:32.592
Yeah.
You're good at that,
at not talking.

40:32.626 --> 40:33.960
And I don't want
to talk to you here,

40:33.994 --> 40:36.662
where we might
be overheard, I want to
talk to you at home.

40:38.832 --> 40:40.633
I went to see
Dylan's father today.

40:41.702 --> 40:42.868
Oh, God.
Yeah.

40:42.903 --> 40:44.971
No kidding around, Benjamin,
let's get out of here.

40:51.745 --> 40:53.846
We were in the lab.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.747
We lit the Bunsen burner.

40:54.781 --> 40:59.144
We roasted marshmallows
and made s'mores.

40:59.145 --> 41:05.004
