00:01.397 --> 00:03.370
- What's the plan again ?
- To set them loose

00:03.464 --> 00:04.556
Pancakes

00:04.614 --> 00:06.658
Can you tell us who else was involved ?

00:06.659 --> 00:07.596
No, I'm sorry

00:07.598 --> 00:09.358
- What did you tell them ?
- They needed a scapegoat

00:09.471 --> 00:10.171
I protected you.

00:10.324 --> 00:12.437
If I serve this one in, you have to go out with me.

00:12.438 --> 00:14.198
- You're 15.
- So a kiss is still out of the question?

00:14.196 --> 00:16.140
My wife just started a business, and she

00:16.152 --> 00:17.817
and her partner are thinking about taking on investors.

00:17.817 --> 00:19.330
And her partner is newly single.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.802
- He wants to talk numbers Monday.
- Who ?

00:21.809 --> 00:23.152
The Bullet.
He loves New Match.

00:23.156 --> 00:24.703
What the hell you doing here, boy?

00:24.705 --> 00:26.503
- You're on a date with my dad?
- You know each other?

00:26.505 --> 00:27.881
- Kiss me.
- Uh, what?

00:27.887 --> 00:30.702
If you don't feel anything,
I will never mention it again.

00:30.717 --> 00:31.731
One kiss.

What's cooking, Ryan?

01:04.777 --> 01:06.141
Hey, Ryan?

01:06.527 --> 01:07.651
Ryan?

01:09.605 --> 01:11.202
I shmeared it for you.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.701
Thanks.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.663
Is everything okay?

01:20.695 --> 01:21.581
Yeah.

01:22.297 --> 01:23.853
I'm just gonna go see
if Seth's up.

01:23.867 --> 01:25.643
I am up, and I'm out of here.
What ?

01:25.695 --> 01:27.581
- Where you going?
- I didn't know you were planning a trip.

01:27.585 --> 01:30.171
Neither did Summer, but
RISD sent my dorm info,

01:30.175 --> 01:31.461
so I figured I'd
check out my new home

01:31.468 --> 01:33.760
and give her some moral
support for finals.

01:33.768 --> 01:34.990
Are you gonna eat that?

01:35.235 --> 01:36.653
Are you sure that's
such a good idea?

01:36.657 --> 01:37.843
Why, did Ryan do
something to it?

01:37.846 --> 01:39.283
No, not the bagel,
the trip-- I thought

01:39.287 --> 01:40.890
you were gonna give Summer
some more space.

01:41.777 --> 01:43.903
Well, a little space turned
into a lot of missing me.

01:43.908 --> 01:44.830
That's my cab.

01:44.835 --> 01:46.011
E-mail me a
Christmukkah list.

01:46.015 --> 01:47.641
I'm gonna be shopping
at the Providence Place Mall.

01:47.647 --> 01:49.510
They have carpeting,
which is weird.

01:49.667 --> 01:52.171
They have a Dave & Buster's,
but parking sucks.

01:52.388 --> 01:53.830
Listen, dude, I really

01:53.835 --> 01:54.882
need to talk to you--
it's very important.

01:54.885 --> 01:56.192
Okay, and I want to
hear all about it

01:56.195 --> 01:57.891
when I land in Providence.
Just call me.

02:00.675 --> 02:01.951
So we've had a chance

02:01.958 --> 02:03.590
to review your situation,

02:03.596 --> 02:06.080
and the board has come
to a unanimous decision.

02:06.346 --> 02:08.490
Effective immediately,
you are suspended

02:08.497 --> 02:10.643
from this university
until next fall.

02:10.645 --> 02:11.510
Suspended?

02:11.748 --> 02:14.013
Breaking into that lab
was very serious.

02:14.238 --> 02:16.192
If it wasn't for your
excellent record,

02:16.197 --> 02:18.091
the board might have
involved the police.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.702
I'm sorry, um, I'm just not sure

02:20.708 --> 02:21.872
what I'm supposed to do now.

02:21.875 --> 02:22.760
It's done.

02:23.536 --> 02:25.380
You can go to the dorm
and start packing.

02:26.816 --> 02:28.952
But I have finals, and friends.

02:29.007 --> 02:31.141
I'm afraid you're no
longer a student here.

02:31.507 --> 02:34.203
But my dad is living in Seattle
with the step-monster

02:34.205 --> 02:36.292
And Taylor Townsend
is sleeping in my old bed.

02:36.295 --> 02:38.133
And Seth was moving out here
so we could be together.

02:38.147 --> 02:39.321
Ms. Roberts,

02:39.325 --> 02:40.911
you need to go home.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.762
This is my home.

03:47.918 --> 03:49.130
It's  just you and me now.

03:50.706 --> 03:51.911
Summer Bear.

03:57.858 --> 04:00.380
So, I heard
the iron fist of justice

04:00.388 --> 04:03.013
came crashing down on you
swiftly, without mercy.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.133
Yep. Sounds like your plan

04:05.137 --> 04:06.262
worked out perfectly.

04:06.338 --> 04:07.892
Oh, come on, that's not fair.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.633
Back at the reservation,

04:10.635 --> 04:12.321
they taught us,
sometimes

04:12.646 --> 04:15.133
the weaker gazelle must be devoured

04:15.278 --> 04:17.940
- for the good of the herd.
- Oh, Che, just shut up, okay?

04:17.957 --> 04:20.063
Before I tie you up
with hemp rope, set you on fire,

04:20.067 --> 04:22.203
and get high off the fumes
from your burning flesh.

04:22.976 --> 04:23.883
Dark.

04:24.687 --> 04:26.941
I think the fact that
you would use hemp

04:27.395 --> 04:29.571
proved that I have made a
difference in your life.

04:30.155 --> 04:31.763
Yeah, Che, you have.

04:32.455 --> 04:33.823
You got me thrown out of school.

04:36.017 --> 04:38.011
You know, I really liked this place.

04:38.818 --> 04:40.333
I liked who I was becoming at it.

04:40.337 --> 04:42.630
- I mean, this was my life.
- And you sacrificed it

04:42.975 --> 04:45.583
for the good of the... the-the cause.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.512
You're a martyr.
You're a hero.

04:47.517 --> 04:49.013
I just wanted to be a student.

04:50.446 --> 04:52.600
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to find my roommate

04:52.607 --> 04:54.440
and tell her that
she now has a single.

05:26.196 --> 05:27.640
Are you dirty, Ryan?

05:27.645 --> 05:28.500
Ryan?

05:29.106 --> 05:30.233
Hello?

05:30.825 --> 05:31.761
Hey.

05:32.446 --> 05:34.050
I-I couldn't help but notice

05:34.055 --> 05:35.642
that you wanted to talk to Seth.

05:35.646 --> 05:36.832
Oh, did I?

05:36.835 --> 05:38.353
Well, since he's out of town
and he's gonna be

05:38.355 --> 05:40.452
moving out next semester,
you're gonna need a new Seth.

05:40.896 --> 05:42.320
Don't tell Sandy, but...

05:43.027 --> 05:44.423
I thought I would audition for the job.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.823
Oh, uh, yeah, well, that's,

05:45.826 --> 05:47.010
uh, very thoughtful.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.451
So... how does it work?

05:51.305 --> 05:52.741
Do I ask you what's on your mind?

05:52.758 --> 05:54.580
Uh, usually you talk about yourself,

05:54.588 --> 05:56.643
and I solve my problems on my own.

05:58.348 --> 06:00.140
I couldn't help but notice that you've been

06:00.146 --> 06:01.491
spending time with Taylor.

06:01.498 --> 06:02.431
Rea... Have I?

06:02.437 --> 06:04.073
If we're gonna talk about girls,

06:04.466 --> 06:07.083
I am a far more knowledgeable
resource than my son.

06:08.865 --> 06:10.802
Okay. But you can't repeat this, all right?

06:10.807 --> 06:12.900
Because if the real Seth found out
I was telling the substitute

06:12.905 --> 06:14.141
Seth a real secret...

06:14.145 --> 06:15.302
It's in the vault.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.510
Okay.

06:16.887 --> 06:18.762
I kissed Taylor.
Or she kissed me.

06:18.768 --> 06:20.502
Anyway, there was
a kiss, and, uh...

06:20.505 --> 06:22.762
- And now you can't stop thinking about her.
- Pretty much.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.982
That is so cute.
Okay, Seth never does that.

06:24.987 --> 06:26.012
S orry.

06:26.158 --> 06:28.183
But it is, and so is she.

06:28.186 --> 06:29.293
Yeah, I know, it's just

06:29.298 --> 06:30.393
me and Taylor?

06:30.398 --> 06:31.940
After everything
you've been through

06:31.947 --> 06:33.252
over the last few months,

06:33.365 --> 06:35.013
if something good happens,

06:35.136 --> 06:36.631
shouldn't  you embrace it?

06:36.637 --> 06:38.422
Or at least be open
to the possibility?

06:40.506 --> 06:41.390
You're right.

06:41.986 --> 06:43.391
You're right. Thanks.

06:44.016 --> 06:45.240
Okay.

06:45.668 --> 06:48.013
- So do I get the job?
- You're on the short list.

07:02.287 --> 07:05.000
Spencer, what brings you
to Casa de Cooper?

07:05.003 --> 07:07.197
- Your racket.
- You restrung it for me.

07:07.637 --> 07:09.100
That's so sweet.

07:09.765 --> 07:11.872
Yeah, I went with
the Pro-Flex Fiber Tour.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.131
It should, uh... it should
cut down on the tension.

07:14.137 --> 07:16.942
Good, because I've been having
a lot of stress lately.

07:17.238 --> 07:19.401
I could use a little bit
of... relaxing.

07:19.408 --> 07:20.753
String tension, Kaitlin.

07:20.866 --> 07:23.562
Well, now that you
and my mom are over,

07:23.568 --> 07:25.352
maybe you can help me
with my stroke.

07:26.336 --> 07:27.843
Yeah, right.

07:28.257 --> 07:30.250
Look, you got a great
backhand, but, uh,

07:30.258 --> 07:31.633
no offense,

07:32.257 --> 07:34.361
I kind of have a "no jail bait" policy.

07:35.028 --> 07:36.270
Lame.

07:36.596 --> 07:38.072
You know, maybe you
should try, uh,

07:38.076 --> 07:39.501
try meeting guys
from your school.

07:39.755 --> 07:41.620
- You mean boys?
- Exactly

07:41.817 --> 07:43.620
Yeah, because
you're in high school.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.333
You know, that place with desks

07:45.336 --> 07:47.030
and chalkboards and kids.

07:47.038 --> 07:48.690
Those are people
your own age.

07:48.698 --> 07:49.940
I don't know, maybe...

07:50.367 --> 07:51.870
maybe you should try
hanging out with them.

07:58.555 --> 08:00.442
Hi, Ryan.

08:02.538 --> 08:04.122
I got to go, can't talk.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.661
I'm-I'm not here
to see you.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.140
I'm just covering for
Seth while he's gone.

08:07.147 --> 08:08.162
That's nice.

08:08.368 --> 08:09.811
Sorry that I kissed you.

08:10.296 --> 08:11.372
What?

08:12.188 --> 08:14.142
No, its... it's cool.

08:14.145 --> 08:15.392
It's obviously not okay.

08:15.396 --> 08:17.252
You're totally uncomfortable
around me now.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.273
No, no. Um...

08:19.528 --> 08:21.523
It's... the kiss is not a problem.

08:21.528 --> 08:23.683
Really? Good, because

08:23.756 --> 08:25.553
usually when I kiss a
guy, it ends in tears.

08:25.557 --> 08:27.693
His, not mine, because, like,
I'm a bit of a lip biter

08:27.706 --> 08:30.513
and, you know, sometimes
I draw blood and...

08:31.387 --> 08:33.121
- Taylor?
- Yeah?

08:33.414 --> 08:35.640
- What are you doing tonight?
- Oh, I'm updating my blog.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.551
It's kind of Felicity by way

08:37.558 --> 08:39.740
of Anais Nin, the erotic memoirs.

08:39.748 --> 08:41.940
- of a soulful college girl.
- Taylor, tonight, are you busy?

08:45.618 --> 08:47.420
Oh. Blog, shmog.

08:48.045 --> 08:51.122
- Is-is that a yes?
- Yes, it is a yes, squared.

08:51.306 --> 08:53.472
In all caps, with an exclamation mark

08:53.476 --> 08:55.003
and a smiley-face emoticon.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.243
A simple yes will do.

08:57.435 --> 08:59.001
Yes.

09:01.286 --> 09:02.881
Great, all right, well,
I'll see you tonight.

09:02.888 --> 09:05.320
Hey, do you just want to come
up to the comic book store?

09:05.325 --> 09:07.503
There's a flat-screen TV,
Surround Sound,

09:07.508 --> 09:09.183
a bevy of Blu-ray anime.

09:09.547 --> 09:11.311
All right. See you then.

09:38.285 --> 09:40.041
- Hey, Eric.
- Kaitlin, hey.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.162
What are you doing here?

09:41.217 --> 09:42.921
It seems like people at
this school like to watch

09:42.928 --> 09:44.662
hairless wonders
in banana slings.

09:44.798 --> 09:46.600
- I'm just trying to fit in.
- Oh, cool.

09:46.707 --> 09:48.221
Well, good to see you.

09:50.197 --> 09:51.353
Ask her.

09:51.475 --> 09:52.600
No, you ask her.

09:52.677 --> 09:54.803
- I'm not gonna ask her
- I'm not gonna...

09:55.188 --> 09:56.912
Do you bitches have a problem?

09:57.407 --> 09:58.603
We saw you talking to Eric Ward.

09:58.607 --> 10:00.352
Oh, my God, he is so hot.

10:00.357 --> 10:01.483
Do you know him?

10:01.488 --> 10:03.470
I know that his brother
shaved his chest.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.603
Seriously?

10:04.768 --> 10:07.042
- That is so...
- Gayer than his dad, I know.

10:08.055 --> 10:09.851
You're Kaitlin Cooper, aren't you?

10:09.858 --> 10:10.660
Yes.

10:10.905 --> 10:12.580
I'm Olivia. This is Lea.

10:13.025 --> 10:15.401
Cool. Do you guys think
anyone would notice

10:15.407 --> 10:17.100
if I sparked a jay
up by the bleachers?

10:17.108 --> 10:18.792
That is so totally illegal.

10:19.765 --> 10:21.442
Is there a reason why you guys
aren't home right now?

10:21.448 --> 10:23.273
Riley, hey! We-we...

10:23.278 --> 10:24.583
Came to cheer on your boyfriend.

10:24.756 --> 10:26.332
Connor's doing awesome.

10:26.335 --> 10:27.830
That's because he is awesome.

10:33.236 --> 10:34.450
Now, get going.

10:34.527 --> 10:36.582
Those party invites aren't
gonna address themselves.

10:36.738 --> 10:37.913
Okay.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.793
Okay, why do you guys
let her talk to you like that?

10:40.797 --> 10:42.602
Well, she's having a
pimps and ho's party

10:42.605 --> 10:44.700
for her sweet 16, and it's gonna
be awesome.

10:44.837 --> 10:46.613
But if we don't help out,
we don't go.

10:46.626 --> 10:47.951
So don't go.

10:47.955 --> 10:48.970
Yeah.

10:49.265 --> 10:50.773
That would be social suicide.

10:50.778 --> 10:53.331
Everyone who's anyone at this
school is going to that party.

10:55.317 --> 10:56.642
No offense.

10:57.927 --> 10:59.201
Come on, Lea.

10:59.485 --> 11:01.050
'Kay, well, if you guys
change your minds,

11:01.058 --> 11:02.260
I'll be by the bleachers.

11:02.276 --> 11:03.201
Sure.

11:03.207 --> 11:04.200
Gotcha.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.173
Hey, man, how's the East Coast
treating you?

11:11.177 --> 11:13.410
Too soon to tell.
I had a layover in Salt Lake

11:13.418 --> 11:15.611
and then I got delayed
in Poughkeepsie.

11:15.615 --> 11:17.123
It's hard to get a direct flight last minute.

11:17.126 --> 11:18.830
Yeah, well,
at least you made it.

11:18.838 --> 11:20.031
Summer  surprised to see you?

11:20.037 --> 11:21.580
I'm headed over there right now.

11:21.585 --> 11:23.520
I got an all-night study package.

11:23.525 --> 11:25.740
I scored a brick
of Dunkin' Donuts coffee

11:25.756 --> 11:28.141
and some reasonably priced meth
from this homeless guy.

11:28.148 --> 11:31.393
Oh, I'm sure she'll appreciate
the pick-me-up, very thoughtful.

11:31.397 --> 11:33.863
How are things with you?
I know you wanted to talk.

11:34.857 --> 11:36.522
Things are weird.

11:38.837 --> 11:40.390
And about to get a lot weirder.

11:40.585 --> 11:42.711
That wasn't vague
or ominous at all.

11:42.716 --> 11:44.580
- I'll explain later.
- Well, good luck.

11:44.585 --> 11:45.591
Back at you.

11:45.865 --> 11:47.392
I know you're unhappy,

11:47.397 --> 11:48.973
but you've been out with
seven different men.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.281
You mean seven versions
of the same man.

11:51.285 --> 11:52.820
Republican real estate developer

11:52.827 --> 11:54.650
hates his ex-wife,
loves golf.

11:54.668 --> 11:55.773
This is Newport.

11:55.777 --> 11:58.273
You live in a monkey cage,
you have to date chimps.

11:58.498 --> 12:01.540
Well, maybe you could throw
a gorilla into the mix.

12:01.548 --> 12:03.022
I appreciate the analogy,

12:03.655 --> 12:05.401
but, Pam, how do we fix this?

12:05.978 --> 12:08.390
Find  me a man
who will surprise me.

12:08.397 --> 12:10.453
Someone different.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.452
Her prayers have
been answered.

12:15.938 --> 12:18.830
I tell you, the women are
well-preserved in this town.

12:18.907 --> 12:20.683
If my slacks weren't
so damn tight...

12:20.688 --> 12:22.772
Bullet, what are
you doing here?

12:22.777 --> 12:25.381
I thought you were going
to be a silent partner.

12:25.387 --> 12:26.771
Oh, I ain't here to work.

12:26.777 --> 12:28.140
I came to see my girlfriend.

12:28.145 --> 12:30.141
- What? No, I am not...
- Car's waiting outside.

12:30.145 --> 12:31.950
Dinner's planned.
I'd invite Blondie,

12:31.957 --> 12:33.581
but she don't look
much like an eater.

12:33.807 --> 12:35.391
Oh, that's a shame.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.833
I'm going to let you two
figure this out.

12:38.838 --> 12:40.892
- See you in the morning.
- Kirs...

12:42.395 --> 12:43.962
Okay, I'm not having
dinner with you.

12:43.966 --> 12:47.811
A) You repulse me,
and B) I'm busy.

12:47.816 --> 12:49.440
Well, A) that's cool;

12:49.446 --> 12:51.103
2) busy doing what?

12:51.478 --> 12:53.702
A client is unhappy
with our man base,

12:53.708 --> 12:55.493
so I have to go on
a major recruiting mission.

12:55.495 --> 12:58.743
Or you can just put them
in the Bullet's line of fire.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.771
Okay, while the client
is looking for something

13:00.778 --> 13:03.513
out of the norm, "lunatic" probably
isn't her type.

13:04.146 --> 13:05.371
- Have dinner with me.
- No.

13:05.376 --> 13:06.380
- A cocktail?
- No!

13:06.385 --> 13:07.472
Then let's just make out.

13:07.478 --> 13:08.642
I can hurt you.

13:10.095 --> 13:11.253
Wow.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.182
Call me.

13:27.396 --> 13:28.831
Isn't this just great?

13:29.218 --> 13:31.392
I mean, did you ever think
that decapitation

13:31.397 --> 13:32.552
could be so beautiful?

13:32.558 --> 13:33.620
How many times
have you seen this?

13:33.626 --> 13:35.183
Oh, I watch it every night.

13:35.188 --> 13:36.451
It helps relax me.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.081
Is everything okay?

14:12.107 --> 14:13.203
I'm sorry.

14:14.127 --> 14:15.802
So that's a "no."

14:15.807 --> 14:16.983
I can't do this.

14:18.207 --> 14:19.640
Okay, um...

14:20.068 --> 14:21.651
I've done my fair share of

14:21.657 --> 14:22.992
misreading signs in my life,

14:22.996 --> 14:25.202
but you asked me to hang out.

14:25.207 --> 14:26.861
You sat next to me,

14:26.865 --> 14:28.501
you leaned in
with a slight tilt

14:28.507 --> 14:30.033
- of your head.
- I know, I know,

14:30.035 --> 14:31.072
and I'm sorry. Uh

14:31.775 --> 14:34.071
you're a great girl.
It's just, this is too weird.

14:38.555 --> 14:40.413
Well, that makes me
feel so much better.

14:40.415 --> 14:42.142
Me! Not you, me. I'm

14:42.945 --> 14:44.601
weird.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.693
Surprise!

14:47.107 --> 14:48.471
Cohen?

14:52.976 --> 14:55.182
- Cohen.
- Hey, where are you?

14:55.186 --> 14:56.241
Where are you?

14:56.248 --> 14:59.142
- I'm in your room.
- I'm in your room.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.531
Summer, I was going
to surprise you.

15:01.535 --> 15:03.682
- Well, I'm surprised.
- Yeah, me, too.

15:03.688 --> 15:05.123
Why aren't you in school?

15:05.946 --> 15:07.203
Because I got kicked out.

15:08.526 --> 15:10.703
Summer, what'd you do?

15:14.468 --> 15:16.202
I listened to stupid Che

15:16.208 --> 15:17.622
and his stupid plan,

15:17.636 --> 15:19.200
and he sold me down
the stupid river.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.132
I knew anyone that sincere
was not to be trusted.

15:23.237 --> 15:24.701
I miss it already.

15:24.705 --> 15:26.011
I don't know what to do.

15:26.018 --> 15:27.571
Yeah, well, I do.

15:27.647 --> 15:28.821
What?

15:28.825 --> 15:31.013
If he hurt you,
then I'm going to hurt him.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.451
That's funny, Cohen.

15:32.455 --> 15:33.603
See, I knew you could
cheer me up.

15:33.606 --> 15:35.223
I'm serious.
You can at least act like

15:35.228 --> 15:37.490
it's halfway feasible
that I could avenge your honor.

15:37.497 --> 15:38.551
What, you're serious?

15:38.565 --> 15:39.420
No, no, no.

15:39.425 --> 15:41.762
I'm going to go so Ryan Atwood on his ass.

15:41.765 --> 15:43.203
Come on, Cohen,
I don't like this.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.393
Neither will Che.

15:44.397 --> 15:45.642
No, wait, don't...

15:50.068 --> 15:52.533
So Kirsten told me
she came in yesterday

15:52.535 --> 15:54.372
and  applied for the job
of substitute Seth.

15:54.376 --> 15:55.482
She may have.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.582
Well, you know, uh,

15:56.586 --> 15:58.573
if anyone's qualified,
I think we all know

15:58.577 --> 16:01.322
it's me, and I'm thinking the only
reason you didn't ask me

16:01.406 --> 16:02.852
is because no interview
was necessary.

16:02.857 --> 16:05.200
Yeah, well, it turns out I may
not have to fill the position--

16:05.206 --> 16:07.013
I handled the whole
Taylor thing--

16:07.187 --> 16:10.042
although it may be a little
awkward for a while.

16:10.847 --> 16:12.433
What happened?

16:12.495 --> 16:13.783
Nothing happened.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.381
Which was the problem for her.

16:15.526 --> 16:17.113
Yeah, yeah.

16:17.118 --> 16:18.391
But now I don't know.

16:18.846 --> 16:20.401
I mean, at first I thought
I was just caught up in

16:20.406 --> 16:21.541
the whole Volchok thing.

16:21.616 --> 16:23.370
And then I thought the problem might've
been Taylor.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.391
You know, because she can
be a little, uh, weird.

16:25.855 --> 16:27.613
She's a touch eccentric.

16:27.618 --> 16:29.141
But now I think
the problem is me.

16:31.075 --> 16:32.383
Maybe it's too soon.

16:33.435 --> 16:34.941
So keep it casual.

16:35.158 --> 16:38.073
You know, just tell her you...
you need to be friends for now.

16:38.217 --> 16:39.683
Yeah, that's a line
every girl loves to hear.

16:39.695 --> 16:41.122
No, if it's the truth,

16:41.325 --> 16:42.630
she'll understand.

16:43.658 --> 16:45.632
Well, I don't have
any other choice.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.300
All right, I'll give it a shot.

16:47.305 --> 16:48.741
Great, okay, listen,
if there's anything else

16:48.747 --> 16:49.830
I can do for you, I'll be in my room

16:49.836 --> 16:51.703
- reading comics and listening to indie rock.
- All right.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.101
That was a good Seth.

16:53.108 --> 16:54.320
Were you a good Ryan?

16:54.328 --> 16:55.570
I was actually going to borrow one

16:55.575 --> 16:56.922
from the Julie Cooper playbook,

16:56.927 --> 16:59.430
and wait till Che was asleep,
then smother him with a pillow.

16:59.438 --> 17:00.562
Oh, my hero.

17:00.568 --> 17:02.600
But the guy was at some
all-night candlelight vigil.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.262
Still, he's got to sleep
sometime.

17:07.497 --> 17:09.693
This place reeks of incense
and righteousness.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.942
Oh, that's Che's musk.

17:10.945 --> 17:11.892
Look, be careful.

17:11.897 --> 17:12.942
He's not in his room.

17:13.008 --> 17:14.531
Neither was your roommate last night.

17:14.536 --> 17:16.251
Yeah, that's because she's a huge slut.

17:16.596 --> 17:18.321
Wait a minute, what's this?

17:18.328 --> 17:20.382
What, I don't know.
I'm on the phone, I can't see.

17:31.047 --> 17:32.323
Hello, Seth.

17:32.326 --> 17:34.500
News of your vendetta has reached my ears.

17:34.505 --> 17:36.570
Is that Che?
What's happening?

17:36.577 --> 17:37.690
I'm a pacifist.

17:38.505 --> 17:40.822
Until cooler heads prevail...

17:41.426 --> 17:43.073
I will be underground.

17:44.575 --> 17:45.630
Peace.

17:47.335 --> 17:48.630
He's gonna run?

17:48.636 --> 17:49.882
That coward!

17:49.888 --> 17:50.940
I'm going to watch it again

17:50.945 --> 17:52.503
for background noise,
visual cues,

17:52.507 --> 17:54.841
anything that might tip me off
to his whereabouts.

17:54.855 --> 17:56.031
No, Cohen,

17:56.036 --> 17:57.803
Che has had survival training, okay.

17:57.808 --> 18:00.202
He's probably hiding in a cave
somewhere with Osama Bin Laden.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.372
Look, forget about him.
I need you, and I'm here.

18:03.355 --> 18:06.072
All right, but for the record,
I did not back down.

18:06.077 --> 18:07.533
And I love you for it.

18:07.535 --> 18:08.602
Come home.

18:08.606 --> 18:09.510
Okay.

18:12.896 --> 18:14.000
Summer?

18:14.385 --> 18:15.492
What are you doing here?

18:15.496 --> 18:18.692
Oh, I slept out here.
Turns out I like nature.

18:18.696 --> 18:20.180
And Taylor's in my bed.

18:20.185 --> 18:22.131
No, I mean, what are you
doing here in Newport?

18:23.446 --> 18:24.753
Long story.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.412
Well,

18:28.407 --> 18:30.692
then if you need anything
or just want to talk,

18:30.695 --> 18:31.910
I'm here for you.

18:32.017 --> 18:33.010
Thanks, Julie.

18:33.018 --> 18:34.350
And you should go
reclaim your bedroom.

18:34.357 --> 18:35.691
Taylor has boundary issues.

18:37.137 --> 18:38.391
Is that a bunny?

18:42.775 --> 18:44.381
Okay, so if I don't
call your name,

18:44.386 --> 18:45.752
that means you're not coming.

18:46.077 --> 18:48.383
All the hot senior guys
already got their invites.

18:50.107 --> 18:51.193
Jeanie.

18:55.037 --> 18:56.383
Kristin.

19:00.228 --> 19:02.553
- Sarah.
- She's got to invite us, right?

19:02.558 --> 19:03.600
She'd better.

19:03.606 --> 19:05.381
We stayed up all night
licking envelopes.

19:05.575 --> 19:06.633
Alexis.

19:08.578 --> 19:09.782
Michelle.

19:11.355 --> 19:12.561
Shana.

19:13.566 --> 19:15.923
And lastly, me, duh.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.251
Wait, what about us?

19:18.255 --> 19:20.203
Sorry, but I didn't know
you'd ruin the envelopes

19:20.208 --> 19:21.622
with your heinous saliva stains.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.902
The whole school could get
gonorrhea of the throat.

19:23.906 --> 19:25.001
But you promised!

19:25.298 --> 19:27.252
- Exactly
- I'm afraid it'd be unsanitary.

19:27.486 --> 19:29.083
You guys can all come to my party.

19:29.318 --> 19:30.810
It's tonight, my house.

19:33.376 --> 19:35.342
Well, I rented out Hide,
and did you know that

19:35.348 --> 19:37.293
Chef Hu yells at people?
He's making sushi,

19:37.297 --> 19:40.162
and Danity Kane is playing a 25-minute set.

19:40.167 --> 19:42.940
Well, sushi's high in mercury,
and Danity Kane sucks.

19:43.196 --> 19:45.312
I've got five kegs, a quarter ounce

19:45.446 --> 19:47.202
and absolutely no parents.

19:47.268 --> 19:48.371
Sweet!

19:49.078 --> 19:50.642
Bring whoever you guys want.

19:50.646 --> 19:52.633
And don't worry about
any lame costumes.

19:57.408 --> 19:58.481
Thanks.

19:58.707 --> 20:00.442
Yeah, that was really nice
inviting us to your party.

20:00.448 --> 20:02.752
- It sounds like fun.
- Oh, it will be.

20:05.468 --> 20:06.992
You want to join New Match?

20:06.996 --> 20:08.381
I don't understand.

20:08.977 --> 20:11.123
The application fee is rather steep,

20:11.128 --> 20:13.462
and most of our female clients are over 35.

20:13.467 --> 20:15.672
Look, you need new recruits, right?

20:15.678 --> 20:17.121
So sign us up.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.872
Here's a check to cover it.

20:22.325 --> 20:23.812
And I believe this is for you.

20:23.815 --> 20:25.873
Uh-huh, and I think I know who it is.

20:26.467 --> 20:27.502
Bang!

20:27.718 --> 20:29.742
Am I good or am I good?

20:29.747 --> 20:30.700
What do you think you're doing?

20:30.706 --> 20:32.861
Well, money may not buy
love or happiness,

20:32.868 --> 20:34.803
but it'll buy a whole lot
of bachelors.

20:34.896 --> 20:37.652
I think you owe me
a weekend as a thanks.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.013
No, I can't.
I already have plans.

20:40.016 --> 20:40.871
Cancel them.

20:41.186 --> 20:42.273
I'm going away for the weekend

20:42.286 --> 20:44.372
with Kirsten and Sandy.

20:44.425 --> 20:46.752
To the Montage, it's their anniversary.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.443
You're celebrating
their anniversary?

20:49.498 --> 20:52.373
They're having a recommitment
ceremony and, uh...

20:52.558 --> 20:54.192
I am their witness.

20:54.735 --> 20:57.522
Well, that's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

20:57.528 --> 20:58.650
See you there.

21:01.587 --> 21:02.590
The Bullet?

21:02.997 --> 21:04.133
Bang.

21:19.558 --> 21:20.811
Taylor.

21:21.126 --> 21:22.000
Ryan.

21:22.007 --> 21:22.950
Boo!

21:23.868 --> 21:25.061
Didn't run away that time,

21:25.065 --> 21:26.562
so you must not be
that scared of me.

21:27.608 --> 21:29.370
All right, look,
I just wanted to come by

21:29.375 --> 21:31.251
and apologize about last night, and...

21:32.628 --> 21:33.952
And I didn't know
you had company.

21:33.967 --> 21:35.063
Roger, Ryan.

21:35.068 --> 21:35.871
Ryan, Roger.

21:35.875 --> 21:36.742
- Roger.
- Ryan.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.791
I've been helping Roger
track down this obscure

21:38.797 --> 21:40.443
Kinji Fukasaku biography.

21:40.446 --> 21:42.612
And it turns out he
watches Blood Bath IV

21:42.618 --> 21:44.443
every night before
he goes to bed, too.

21:44.898 --> 21:46.182
Well, that's...

21:46.187 --> 21:47.430
Kismet? I know.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.122
Maybe it's too soon
to talk about fate, but...

21:50.748 --> 21:52.522
Yeah, well, anyway,
I just wanted, you know,

21:52.537 --> 21:54.240
to see if you need
a ride home or anything.

21:54.248 --> 21:56.193
- Oh, I got my bike, thanks.
- Not you.

21:57.666 --> 22:00.172
Well, that is very
friendly of you, Ryan,

22:00.178 --> 22:01.503
since I'm assuming

22:01.568 --> 22:03.870
that's what you want
us to be, just friends?

22:04.165 --> 22:05.363
Well, if you're cool with that.

22:05.368 --> 22:08.190
Ryan Atwood,
"mon ami" sounds terrif.

22:08.707 --> 22:10.183
But Roger and I
were just gonna

22:10.446 --> 22:11.812
hang out
and, uh,

22:12.138 --> 22:14.433
order some takeout,
so if you don't mind.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.073
All right, well, uh, you know,
I'll see you, then.

22:20.085 --> 22:21.671
- Bye, friend.
- Bye, Ryan.

22:21.676 --> 22:23.242
- Nice to meet you, man.
- Bye, Roger.

22:24.236 --> 22:25.330
Let's come look at this.

22:25.337 --> 22:26.182
I wanted to show you this.

22:26.187 --> 22:28.103
I really think you guys
should work at this one.

22:28.108 --> 22:29.930
This really why
you work here?

22:35.717 --> 22:37.312
Yeah, I talked to my dad today.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.130
He was pretty disappointed in me.

22:39.138 --> 22:42.240
Well, I'm leaving the Antelope
Valley Airport now, so

22:42.657 --> 22:44.990
there's just the $100 cab ride home.

22:45.836 --> 22:47.182
Just get here soon, okay?

22:47.187 --> 22:48.553
Okay, I love you.

22:49.425 --> 22:50.993
That was fast.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.311
I've come to atone for my sins.

23:03.198 --> 23:04.802
Just circle around the block with the kegs

23:04.916 --> 23:06.932
I have to get my mother out of the house.

23:07.835 --> 23:10.293
What, or convince her to let me
throw a huge party

23:10.298 --> 23:11.673
with underage drinking?

23:12.387 --> 23:14.310
Yeah, I have to get her out of the house.

23:18.756 --> 23:20.373
Are you going somewhere?

23:20.857 --> 23:22.541
yeah, I'm going to the Montage

23:22.545 --> 23:24.561
with Sandy and Kirsten,
just for the weekend.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.373
Going to a hotel
with Sandy and Kirsten?

23:28.495 --> 23:30.741
They're not spicing their
relationship up, are they?

23:30.746 --> 23:32.540
Please, Sandy and Kirsten?

23:32.545 --> 23:34.300
Yeah, they don't exactly scream threesome.

23:36.176 --> 23:37.930
Just how old are you ?

23:39.365 --> 23:40.901
So I guess I can assume
you'll be fine

23:40.905 --> 23:42.160
without me this weekend?

23:42.175 --> 23:43.862
Oh, I think I can survive.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.261
Now, if you need anything,
Summer

23:47.268 --> 23:48.622
and Taylor are in charge.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.931
Wait, Summer's here?

23:50.608 --> 23:52.082
Fine, Che, if you're really going
to dehydrate,

23:52.087 --> 23:54.141
camp down on the front lawn,
I'll get you some water. Hi!

23:57.885 --> 23:59.993
So you don't believe
that I'm thirsty, huh?

24:00.127 --> 24:01.431
Now you think I'm a liar.

24:01.475 --> 24:03.113
And a chicken
and a snake

24:03.126 --> 24:04.400
and a rat

24:04.825 --> 24:06.390
Well, those are
all God's creatures.

24:06.397 --> 24:08.522
And they're all fallable.
I made a mistake.

24:08.525 --> 24:10.503
It wasn't a mistake.
You deliberately used me.

24:10.508 --> 24:13.140
Summer, I cannot go on with my
life with this issue unresolved.

24:13.236 --> 24:15.702
So let's go out on the lawn
and have a truth circle.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.643
this will be your opportunity
to tell me how you're really feeling.

24:17.648 --> 24:18.680
I have.

24:18.685 --> 24:20.033
I hate you. Now leave.

24:20.077 --> 24:23.053
This can't be fixed by some
candlelight vigil or a petition, okay?

24:23.065 --> 24:24.772
And I'm not some tree that you

24:24.778 --> 24:26.240
can just chain yourself to.

24:26.606 --> 24:28.103
We'll see about that.

24:28.107 --> 24:30.072
What? What did you do?

24:30.076 --> 24:31.662
This is not funny
Give me the key.

24:31.668 --> 24:34.183
I cannot unlock us
until we are done healing.

24:34.495 --> 24:37.023
Hmm. Okay, then be prepared to stay here

24:37.025 --> 24:38.863
for the rest of your life,
'cause that's never going to happen.

24:43.327 --> 24:45.010
A weekend away at the Montage.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.233
Honey, you've outdone yourself

24:46.235 --> 24:47.432
I don't know about that.

24:47.665 --> 24:48.950
Oh, no, listen,

24:48.957 --> 24:50.441
I'm going to be paying you
back later tonight.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.000
Guess who packed Scrabble?

24:52.007 --> 24:53.413
There's just one small wrinkle

24:53.416 --> 24:56.430
in this otherwise charming romantic
holiday that I forgot to share.

24:56.605 --> 24:58.611
Not to worry.
I TiVoed the Australian Open.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.743
- Tiger's going to take it any
- Just one more thing.

25:02.035 --> 25:04.421
Tell me at least he's got
a separate room.

25:04.428 --> 25:06.362
Sandy Cohen, you're
looking lovely tonight.

25:06.367 --> 25:08.843
If my date didn't look so hot,
I might scope you out.

25:08.846 --> 25:10.711
Well I-I'm jealous.

25:10.715 --> 25:11.950
Now, who is the lucky date?

25:11.957 --> 25:13.650
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.532
I owe you both big time.

25:17.335 --> 25:18.743
I'll make this up
to you tonight.

25:18.845 --> 25:20.601
I am so damn honored

25:20.605 --> 25:21.743
to be here with you and Kirsten

25:21.748 --> 25:23.110
for your recommitment ceremony.

25:23.118 --> 25:24.861
I am crying already.

25:24.866 --> 25:25.910
Real tears

25:26.816 --> 25:28.121
Come on, let's eat.

25:30.627 --> 25:33.252
Wait until you see the Takeshi kitonep I kept

25:33.557 --> 25:35.521
Battle Royale. Can't top it.

25:35.527 --> 25:38.613
It's packed in its original
packaging, so no groping...

25:39.487 --> 25:41.051
- Summer. Che.
- Taylor

25:41.765 --> 25:43.500
- Taylor.
- Roger, Summer. Che

25:43.508 --> 25:44.430
- Roger.
- Roger.

25:44.437 --> 25:45.861
- Summer. Che.
- What are you doing?

25:45.866 --> 25:48.561
Well, I live here again,
so I moved some of your stuff into the guest room

25:48.785 --> 25:51.001
uh. Are you two handcuff
to each other?

25:51.005 --> 25:52.432
As a matter of fact, we are.

25:52.867 --> 25:53.803
Summer Roberts,

25:53.807 --> 25:55.062
you'v learned
a few things

25:55.068 --> 25:56.792
from that college roomate of yours

25:56.828 --> 25:58.221
- When does Seth arrive?
- Ew

25:58.675 --> 26:01.663
no, it's not like that
In fact, don't talk to him, he's not here

26:01.668 --> 26:03.663
Ignoring me is not gonna make me go away

26:03.666 --> 26:04.762
- How about killing you
- Okay

26:04.767 --> 26:06.493
To which guest room
did you move my things?

26:06.495 --> 26:07.862
I'll show you

26:11.458 --> 26:12.730
What was that?

26:13.366 --> 26:14.473
Get...

26:19.195 --> 26:20.253
This thing weighs a ton

26:20.256 --> 26:21.941
That's why you're pushing it and not me

26:22.815 --> 26:24.401
Kaitlin,
What's going on?

26:24.777 --> 26:26.621
Just having a few friends
over at my house.

26:26.625 --> 26:27.701
It's my house

26:27.705 --> 26:28.721
I think

26:28.727 --> 26:30.171
Kaitlin, you cannot have
a party

26:30.188 --> 26:31.353
Your mother left me in charge.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.562
Actually, she left me
in charge.

26:32.565 --> 26:34.373
if you want, Kaitlin is it ?

26:34.386 --> 26:36.162
I'd be more than happy
to entertain you guests

26:36.168 --> 26:39.091
with some festiv tribal music.
The didridoo's in the car.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.723
You love the didge. We're friends again?

26:40.918 --> 26:42.232
Ok, freak.

26:42.347 --> 26:44.293
Summer, why is this guy handcuff to your wrist?

26:44.298 --> 26:45.940
No, there's no one
handcuff to my wrist.

26:45.946 --> 26:47.282
He doesn't exist.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.812
Also kind of
freaky. Okay.

26:48.877 --> 26:50.803
You gu hurry up.
I got to tap these kegs

26:50.896 --> 26:52.162
because we're running
out of time

26:52.168 --> 26:54.050
- What?
- Kaitlin!

26:56.537 --> 26:58.033
Roger?!

27:00.305 --> 27:02.061
You won't believe your eyes.

27:02.106 --> 27:03.912
<i>These girls are wild.</i>

27:04.485 --> 27:06.392
<i>Get out of here now!</i>

27:18.468 --> 27:20.411
Ride with me, Ryan.

27:22.327 --> 27:24.583
So the good news is,
my frequent-flier miles

27:24.586 --> 27:25.913
just reached platinum.

27:25.918 --> 27:26.981
The bad news is,

27:26.997 --> 27:28.512
they don't
change the in-flight movie,

27:28.515 --> 27:30.153
and 'Failure to Launch'
does not hold up on

27:30.165 --> 27:31.292
the third viewing.

27:31.295 --> 27:32.303
What are you doing here?

27:32.318 --> 27:33.633
Summer got kicked out of school

27:33.638 --> 27:34.750
and I'm about
to head over there.

27:34.998 --> 27:36.140
Can I come with you?

27:36.145 --> 27:38.001
I appreciate your interest
in Summer's future,

27:38.006 --> 27:39.293
but I think this
is a conversation

27:39.298 --> 27:40.720
that's just for the two of us.

27:40.728 --> 27:42.553
- Is Taylor going to be there?
- I assume so.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.052
I like her.

27:44.056 --> 27:46.161
Say what now?
Why would you even think that?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.390
Because I keep imagining her
on roller skates

27:48.398 --> 27:50.811
and washing windows with
a big

27:51.247 --> 27:52.753
bucket of soapy water.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.971
Dude, your fantasies
are so pedestrian.

27:54.975 --> 27:56.321
A sudsy girl? That's...

27:56.616 --> 27:57.851
so average.

27:58.005 --> 27:59.340
Doesn't mean it's not hot.

27:59.348 --> 28:00.572
I guess they call them classics

28:00.578 --> 28:01.713
for a reason.

28:02.438 --> 28:04.051
Do you want to drive
or sh-should I?

28:08.485 --> 28:09.631
Again!

28:17.375 --> 28:18.971
Okay, game night!

28:19.117 --> 28:20.783
Who wants to play Pictionary, huh?

28:21.725 --> 28:23.160
Come on, guys, get high on life!

28:23.926 --> 28:25.281
Hey! Hey!

28:25.657 --> 28:27.450
Cut it out!
I tan on this chair.

28:27.805 --> 28:29.540
Hey, if you are going
to consummate your union

28:29.546 --> 28:30.821
be safe.

28:32.255 --> 28:33.990
Out of my way, wasteoid.

28:34.157 --> 28:35.182
Hey, stay alive.

28:35.185 --> 28:36.551
- Don't drink and drive.
- Che, shut up!

28:36.775 --> 28:38.091
Where's Kaitlin?

28:40.245 --> 28:41.582
Again!

28:46.197 --> 28:48.540
You guys, your seven minutes is up.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.780
And I'm next.

28:57.406 --> 28:58.742
It's Connor.

28:58.926 --> 29:00.911
Oh, Riley's gonna die.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.321
I mean, it's bad enough you
didn't go to her party.

29:05.288 --> 29:06.783
She doesn't have to know.

29:06.887 --> 29:08.362
Come on, Kaitlin.

29:10.985 --> 29:12.522
Oh, my gosh.

29:16.518 --> 29:17.731
You're so hot.

29:18.106 --> 29:19.721
Why don't I ever see you
around school?

29:19.748 --> 29:21.261
'Cause I don't really
like school.

29:22.076 --> 29:23.691
So are we going to
make out or what?

29:24.125 --> 29:25.413
'Cause the clock
is kind of ticking.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.282
Or we could talk more.

29:27.567 --> 29:28.783
I mean...

29:29.198 --> 29:30.843
Yeah, you seem
really interesting.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.472
I'm not.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.351
Let's make out.

29:37.785 --> 29:39.401
Are you afraid
to cheat on Riley?

29:39.848 --> 29:41.680
No. I don't even like her.

29:41.698 --> 29:42.952
So what's the problem?

29:53.788 --> 29:55.380
Are you... gay?

29:55.417 --> 29:56.630
What?

29:56.706 --> 29:57.981
No!

29:59.167 --> 30:00.482
I don't, I don't,

30:00.485 --> 30:01.670
I don't think so.

30:03.166 --> 30:04.970
Sweetheart, you're so gay.

30:06.748 --> 30:08.530
I know the Jews are good

30:08.538 --> 30:10.032
with numbers and lending stuff.

30:10.037 --> 30:11.593
Now, there's a generalization

30:11.605 --> 30:13.232
that's not even
remotely offensive.

30:13.237 --> 30:14.361
Well, hold on there,
He-bro.

30:14.367 --> 30:16.691
It's just,
if you all control the media,

30:16.705 --> 30:18.302
why does everyone know?

30:18.607 --> 30:20.833
Why not use the media to say

30:20.835 --> 30:22.160
someone else controls it?

30:22.165 --> 30:24.282
It would cause a lot less
resentment that way.

30:27.297 --> 30:29.000
You know, we should talk
about something else.

30:29.376 --> 30:30.691
Dinner was delicious.

30:31.158 --> 30:32.261
Like you ate!

30:32.266 --> 30:33.530
Oh, I know what they say--

30:33.536 --> 30:35.200
"Eat light on
Saturday night."

30:35.397 --> 30:37.130
Less food in the stomach
for the booze.

30:37.388 --> 30:38.752
Bullet,

30:38.758 --> 30:40.171
Kirsten doesn't drink.

30:40.418 --> 30:41.623
Time for bed.
I have a headache.

30:42.405 --> 30:43.910
I guess she doesn't do that
either.

30:45.255 --> 30:46.341
Thank you, Gordon.

30:48.235 --> 30:49.321
Your point of view regarding

30:49.326 --> 30:50.433
the Middle East is something

30:50.438 --> 30:52.390
I will treasure forever.

30:52.405 --> 30:54.880
Well, all I said
was Iran-Iraq war.

30:55.005 --> 30:56.741
Whoever loses, we win.

30:56.746 --> 30:57.782
Honey, let's see

30:57.788 --> 30:59.703
- if we can cancel our room.
- Sounds like a plan.

30:59.705 --> 31:00.722
- Good night, Julie.
- Good night.

31:00.725 --> 31:01.783
Good night.

31:02.276 --> 31:03.952
What about their wedding vows?

31:03.955 --> 31:05.112
That was a lie, Bullet.

31:05.116 --> 31:06.901
Told to avoid you, because you

31:06.907 --> 31:08.403
are an ignorant buffoon.

31:09.127 --> 31:10.622
Now, if you'll excuse me,

31:11.137 --> 31:12.902
I'm going to try and salvage
my friendship

31:12.908 --> 31:14.213
with Sandy and Kirsten.

31:14.645 --> 31:16.093
You want some more coffee?

31:24.515 --> 31:25.680
Let's split up.

31:25.685 --> 31:27.160
- All right, good luck.
- You, too.

31:28.266 --> 31:29.341
Taylor?

31:30.717 --> 31:31.790
Taylor?

31:33.266 --> 31:34.342
Ryan?

31:34.505 --> 31:35.722
Roger, hey.

31:37.868 --> 31:39.621
Uh, keep doing
what you're doing.

31:39.627 --> 31:40.873
I was looking for Taylor,
but clearly she's...

31:40.885 --> 31:42.181
Who's Taylor?

31:47.456 --> 31:48.960
Is this your boyfriend?

31:51.106 --> 31:52.790
Uh, Taylor isn't in there
with you guys, is she?

31:52.805 --> 31:54.030
No.

31:55.577 --> 31:56.793
Okay. What are you doing, man?

31:56.796 --> 31:58.950
Um, I mean, I think Taylor
really likes you,

31:58.958 --> 32:00.072
and you're kind
of leading her on.

32:00.076 --> 32:01.410
I barely even know her.

32:01.416 --> 32:02.531
She told me

32:02.536 --> 32:03.962
if I pretended to like her,

32:03.978 --> 32:05.871
she'd give me
her Kitano action figure.

32:06.795 --> 32:08.003
It's extremely rare.

32:08.008 --> 32:09.401
Wait, she paid you

32:09.407 --> 32:10.592
to pretend to like her?

32:12.618 --> 32:14.091
That sounds like Taylor.

32:15.346 --> 32:17.901
All right, well, uh... carry on.

32:32.275 --> 32:33.901
It's the red-tailed hawk
that was embraced by the Navajo.

32:34.457 --> 32:36.131
Well, well, well.

32:39.077 --> 32:40.792
Looks like you finally crawled
out of your cave.

32:40.797 --> 32:42.690
Seth, perhaps with your presence

32:42.698 --> 32:44.880
we could broker some peace.

32:44.897 --> 32:46.120
What are you doing here, Sandals?

32:46.126 --> 32:47.933
Ruining Summer's life
at Brown wasn't enough?

32:48.336 --> 32:50.602
Cohen, you're here!

32:50.637 --> 32:51.692
Yeah.

32:51.978 --> 32:54.250
Now I want to see what this
guy's got to say for himself.

32:54.255 --> 32:55.301
Please, Seth.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.141
Summer and I are on
a journey together.

32:58.536 --> 33:00.152
A journey towards the truth.

33:00.207 --> 33:01.353
You're on a journey...

33:01.495 --> 33:02.713
to the pool.

33:02.715 --> 33:03.502
What?

33:03.507 --> 33:05.012
What? No! Cohen!

33:18.865 --> 33:20.643
Noone came to my party.

33:20.648 --> 33:22.432
So you dress like a ho
for no reason?

33:22.726 --> 33:24.672
I changed before I came here.

33:25.385 --> 33:27.331
Look, you win, okay?

33:27.918 --> 33:29.831
I'll... I'll serve your command.

33:29.945 --> 33:31.030
The school is yours.

33:31.035 --> 33:32.393
Except that I don't want it.

33:33.855 --> 33:35.392
Just be nicer to your friends.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.640
Connor's totally gay.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.672
Hi, 911?

33:48.138 --> 33:50.892
Yeah, I'd like to report
a totally lame partyer.

33:52.795 --> 33:54.753
I'm a worthless coward,

33:56.177 --> 33:57.972
and you're a glorious martyr.

33:58.676 --> 33:59.892
Sorry,

33:59.898 --> 34:01.450
I didn't realize
about the handcuffs.

34:01.457 --> 34:02.650
Well, you know,

34:02.657 --> 34:03.871
it's all Che's fault.

34:03.876 --> 34:04.890
It's my fault.

34:05.665 --> 34:07.450
Just know I hate myself more

34:07.455 --> 34:08.420
than you could ever hate me.

34:08.426 --> 34:10.330
- I'm capable of a lot of hate.
- It's true.

34:13.315 --> 34:14.891
You're my best friend, Summer.

34:16.476 --> 34:18.121
All those other kids,
they only joined the cause

34:18.136 --> 34:19.712
so it'd look good on their
grad school applications.

34:19.717 --> 34:21.411
But you, but you really

34:21.417 --> 34:23.210
believed in the good
we were doing.

34:23.216 --> 34:24.572
We did a lot of good.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.261
I let you down, I know.

34:27.485 --> 34:28.853
I'm sorry.

34:33.087 --> 34:34.431
I liberated those bunnies

34:34.436 --> 34:36.822
because I believed that
they should be set free.

34:37.085 --> 34:38.451
I knew the consequences

34:38.458 --> 34:39.639
if I got caught.

34:40.847 --> 34:42.731
Look, I can't spend
my whole life blaming you,

34:42.735 --> 34:45.391
so I accept your apology.

34:46.034 --> 34:48.143
With an asterisk next to it.

34:48.304 --> 34:49.911
And there's a footnote
at the bottom.

34:50.116 --> 34:51.172
And it says

34:51.177 --> 34:52.550
you don't deserve it.

34:55.297 --> 34:56.841
You're so much more
enlightened than

34:56.848 --> 34:58.252
I could ever hope to be.

34:59.637 --> 35:01.191
I think I need
to blow my nose.

35:01.806 --> 35:03.342
No, you...
Could you unlock us first?

35:03.347 --> 35:04.160
Okay.

35:05.066 --> 35:06.511
I guess
now we are

35:07.188 --> 35:08.391
free

35:08.697 --> 35:10.203
to take our own paths.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.701
Yours leads toward the airport.

35:11.708 --> 35:12.873
Yeah, okay, yeah.

35:12.887 --> 35:13.953
I should be going.

35:13.968 --> 35:15.110
You ready, Dalton?

35:15.117 --> 35:17.193
Your bags are packed, Winchester.

35:17.197 --> 35:18.661
- Winchester?
- Winchester?

35:18.667 --> 35:20.021
Why do they think
they call me Che?

35:20.025 --> 35:21.733
Your father's G-4

35:21.735 --> 35:23.101
is waiting
on the tarmac.

35:23.118 --> 35:24.973
I thought you grew up
on a reservation.

35:24.976 --> 35:26.511
It was a reservation--

35:26.847 --> 35:28.233
a beautiful reservation--

35:28.237 --> 35:30.591
Before it became
a family compound

35:30.597 --> 35:31.870
that's all gated.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.331
My dad owns
a pharmaceutical company

35:34.455 --> 35:36.073
and some factories in Mexico.

35:36.998 --> 35:38.922
Well, I guess every kid

35:38.926 --> 35:41.180
finds a way
to rebel against their parents.

35:41.197 --> 35:42.823
Good-bye, Caterpillar.

35:45.008 --> 35:46.980
And defender of
Caterpillar's honor.

35:48.757 --> 35:49.951
My mistake, Brother

35:54.645 --> 35:55.823
So he was a liar,

35:55.836 --> 35:57.111
a coward and a hypocrite.

35:57.117 --> 35:58.360
At least he had depth.

35:59.445 --> 36:01.563
I guess I am really
back home again.

36:01.976 --> 36:04.303
Which is great,
except now I have to leave.

36:08.628 --> 36:09.722
Taylor?

36:09.935 --> 36:11.073
Ryan.

36:11.076 --> 36:12.283
What are you doing?

36:12.818 --> 36:14.250
Someone wrote I love poop

36:14.267 --> 36:15.531
on this poor boy's face.

36:15.545 --> 36:17.593
You know, that kind of thing
can scar you for life.

36:17.595 --> 36:18.903
No, what are you doing paying

36:18.905 --> 36:20.151
your gay friend Roger to pretend

36:20.157 --> 36:21.371
he's in love with you?

36:22.956 --> 36:24.460
Well, what if I did, hmm?

36:24.966 --> 36:27.393
What if I did rent a homosexual
for the evening?

36:27.456 --> 36:29.872
And pay him with rare
collectibles from Asian cinema?

36:30.076 --> 36:31.550
What difference does it make to you?

36:31.685 --> 36:33.133
Well, it's a little strange.

36:33.135 --> 36:34.393
Well, so am I.

36:34.396 --> 36:36.122
Which is why you ran away
from me last night.

36:36.125 --> 36:37.831
No, it wasn't 'cause
you're strange.

36:38.157 --> 36:39.743
You don't find me strange?

36:39.746 --> 36:41.941
No, I do, but that's
not why I took off. Look

36:43.328 --> 36:45.342
I'm not really ready
for a relationship right now

36:45.357 --> 36:47.882
- or a girlfriend.
- Uh... girlfriend?

36:48.038 --> 36:49.390
Cart, horse?

36:49.397 --> 36:51.321
Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself there?

36:52.347 --> 36:53.833
Well, I mean, just

36:53.965 --> 36:56.760
because I want to use your body

36:56.766 --> 36:57.893
as a jungle gym,

36:57.897 --> 36:59.681
doesn't mean that
we have to get married.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.690
- I see.
- I mean, my divorce papers

37:01.696 --> 37:03.040
aren't even dry yet.

37:06.008 --> 37:09.321
Look, you're a sweet, smart,

37:09.835 --> 37:11.571
great guy, Ryan Atwood.

37:12.367 --> 37:13.633
And hot.

37:13.645 --> 37:15.072
Did I mention hot?

37:17.228 --> 37:19.202
So whatever happens,

37:19.485 --> 37:20.902
happens.

37:22.736 --> 37:24.390
- Taylor, that's...
- Normal?

37:25.167 --> 37:26.200
Yeah.

37:26.526 --> 37:27.942
Yeah, I have my moments.

37:35.076 --> 37:37.422
You know, this is
my first high school bash.

37:38.576 --> 37:40.542
Have you ever played
Seven Minutes in Heaven?

37:44.678 --> 37:46.412
Thanks to you, Sandy and Kirsten

37:46.417 --> 37:47.972
are packed and on the road.

37:50.847 --> 37:52.193
I'm sorry, Julie.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.213
When God was handing
out brains,

37:54.338 --> 37:55.712
I guess I was sitting
on the toilet.

37:59.448 --> 38:00.960
I swear you make me

38:00.967 --> 38:02.173
all nervous inside.

38:02.176 --> 38:03.640
So you only act like a bigot

38:03.658 --> 38:04.891
and a sexist pig around me?

38:04.897 --> 38:07.063
No, I just feel worse
about it when you're around.

38:09.816 --> 38:11.870
You're such a classy
and elegant dame.

38:11.877 --> 38:13.321
Well, that is true.

38:15.136 --> 38:16.491
Look,

38:16.986 --> 38:19.803
I was trying so hard
to make you laugh,

38:19.807 --> 38:22.043
and I know what a hard time
you've been through, and I...

38:22.968 --> 38:24.503
it just came out all wrong.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.263
I appreciate that, Gordon.

38:30.178 --> 38:31.980
I guess you're heading
on home now, too, huh?

38:31.988 --> 38:33.002
Are you kidding?

38:33.008 --> 38:34.570
I put the room on
the company card.

38:34.576 --> 38:35.842
I've got a mud bath
in the morning.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.440
So, since I ruined dinner,

38:37.448 --> 38:38.750
how about breakfast?

38:39.348 --> 38:40.562
Breakfast?

38:41.375 --> 38:42.222
Okay.

38:42.235 --> 38:44.250
So, uh, should I
call you or nudge you?

38:45.538 --> 38:46.352
Bang.

38:46.937 --> 38:48.221
That was funny.

38:50.327 --> 38:51.833
You have a pretty smile.

38:52.145 --> 38:53.652
My job is to get you
to use it more.

38:53.908 --> 38:55.352
Then you're going
to need better material.

38:55.355 --> 38:57.193
Well, I am working on it.

39:05.556 --> 39:06.880
'Night, Julie.

39:12.988 --> 39:14.441
Can't we be left alone?

39:14.755 --> 39:16.293
It's probably Julie.

39:16.615 --> 39:18.071
She felt terrible.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.501
Well, I bet she did.

39:19.507 --> 39:21.043
She spent the night
with the Bullet.

39:23.507 --> 39:26.210
Hello, I was told you two
are renewing your vows?

39:26.217 --> 39:28.433
I'm a justice of the
peace, here to preside over the ceremony.

39:28.435 --> 39:30.091
Oh, I'm sorry,
that was an excuse.

39:30.225 --> 39:31.741
Yeah, we didn't call for anyone.

39:32.145 --> 39:34.311
I was hired by a Gordon Bullet.

40:12.316 --> 40:13.581
- Hello.
- Julie.

40:13.587 --> 40:15.083
Hey, it's Spencer.

40:15.395 --> 40:16.843
I just wanted to, uh,

40:16.846 --> 40:18.220
call and say thanks.

40:18.365 --> 40:19.613
I had a great night.

40:19.615 --> 40:21.510
I would assume so,
it's pretty late.

40:21.516 --> 40:22.980
I'll, uh, give you your cut

40:22.985 --> 40:24.471
when you get back into town.

40:24.907 --> 40:26.003
My cut?

40:26.006 --> 40:27.072
Spencer,

40:27.315 --> 40:28.782
you pay to join the service.

40:28.788 --> 40:30.400
Your date doesn't pay you.

40:31.155 --> 40:32.883
That... that's illegal.
You're not a gigolo.

40:32.886 --> 40:33.930
Right.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.190
Open phone line.

40:35.778 --> 40:37.192
Got it, my bad.

40:37.195 --> 40:38.363
Anyway, you got yourself

40:38.365 --> 40:40.590
one satisfied customer.

40:41.288 --> 40:42.332
See ya.

40:42.336 --> 40:43.722
Spencer, wait...

40:48.457 --> 40:49.863
- Spencer?
- I wish.

40:50.216 --> 40:51.921
But it's probably for the best.

40:52.066 --> 40:54.670
I am tin roof rusted.

40:54.896 --> 40:56.003
Pam.

40:56.286 --> 40:58.222
- So you had a good night?
- Worth every penny.

40:58.705 --> 41:00.771
And I'll be telling
all my friends.

41:01.317 --> 41:03.780
And what will you be
telling them exactly?

41:20.966 --> 41:22.763
Okay, seven minutes are up.

41:23.767 --> 41:25.181
You said you wanted
to take it slow.

41:25.277 --> 41:27.461
Yeah, well, I don't think
eight minutes would be rushing.

41:28.876 --> 41:30.742
Nine seems like a good pace.

41:31.428 --> 41:33.543
And ten is a nice,

41:33.545 --> 41:34.820
round number.

41:38.435 --> 41:40.063
We could try the
long-distance thing again.

41:40.066 --> 41:42.040
I've got a lot
of frequent-flier miles,

41:42.517 --> 41:44.393
and we survived
one semester apart.

41:44.397 --> 41:45.852
Yeah, barely.

41:46.155 --> 41:48.212
Why don't you move to Providence
with me and get a job.

41:48.218 --> 41:50.443
Oh, right. You'll be in school
and I'll be slinging

41:50.445 --> 41:52.611
baba ganoush on Third Street,
while all the kids are living

41:52.615 --> 41:53.613
the life
that I should be having.

41:53.617 --> 41:56.103
Well, you know, I've really
been enjoying home lately.

41:56.107 --> 41:57.613
Ryan's back and I've been

41:57.615 --> 41:59.173
bonding with the Newpsies.

41:59.536 --> 42:01.151
Maybe, uh, I could put off

42:01.155 --> 42:02.163
RISD for a semester.

42:02.168 --> 42:04.241
We could both go back
together in the fall.

42:05.248 --> 42:07.092
You'd really put off
college for me?

42:08.175 --> 42:09.543
Rhode Island is a big place.

42:09.558 --> 42:10.880
Better we tackle it together.

42:10.888 --> 42:12.972
Cohen, Rhode Island's the
smallest state in the country.

42:12.977 --> 42:14.060
I was kidding.

42:14.068 --> 42:15.103
Right.

42:16.246 --> 42:18.041
There's just one more thing.

42:23.548 --> 42:25.102
This is Pancakes.

42:25.797 --> 42:27.753
Pancakes is very
important to me.

42:28.268 --> 42:30.451
Then you can hold it.
I'm not really an animal person.

42:30.706 --> 42:32.131
Cohen, Pancakes is

42:32.136 --> 42:33.272
my daughter, or my son,

42:33.278 --> 42:34.483
I'm not really sure.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.550
Oh, he's your son.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.112
He kind of looks
like you, Cohen.

42:40.608 --> 42:41.981
Feel how soft he is.

42:43.067 --> 42:44.133
Yeah.

42:44.548 --> 42:45.763
He's beautiful.

42:45.765 --> 42:47.012
Take a look
around, Pancakes.

42:47.238 --> 42:48.792
This is your new home.

42:49.105 --> 42:51.593
What's the, uh.. What's the life span on these things

42:51.595 --> 42:52.412
Hey

42:52.425 --> 42:53.943
I'm just curious, I'm asking

42:54.017 --> 42:58.652
Infinity

42:59.305 --> 43:05.164
