00:18.380 --> 00:21.320
-=Episode 2:"Venus" Part 2=-

00:34.510 --> 00:35.740
Thank you.

00:38.310 --> 00:41.070
You all sounded awesome today.

00:41.810 --> 00:44.370
What's wrong?
Don't you feel well?

00:44.560 --> 00:46.940
Pink Idol is finished and is leaving.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.680
Didn't you say hello?

00:47.700 --> 00:49.690
No. I'm avoiding her.

00:49.710 --> 00:51.710
It's scary. Too scary.

01:01.180 --> 01:03.240
<i>See. Isn't she cute?</i>

01:04.080 --> 01:08.120
<i>Me too. "<3 Heart <3 Heart"</i>

01:08.220 --> 01:10.060
<i>You look happy.</i>

01:10.080 --> 01:12.630
<i>Be careful the paparazzi don't
catch you.</i>

01:13.420 --> 01:15.780
<i>Pink Idol, Jenni?</i>

01:15.910 --> 01:19.680
<i>I should just... You only debuted
a few years ago!</i>

01:19.700 --> 01:21.710
<i>You shouldn't be distracted!</i>

01:24.010 --> 01:25.480
<i>Express delivery!</i>

01:35.760 --> 01:39.060
<i>This lunatic. He's not even a
little careful.</i>

01:39.430 --> 01:40.900
<i>I swear, this person...</i>

01:42.180 --> 01:43.690
<i>A delivery.</i>

01:59.940 --> 02:01.820
<i>Shouldn't we call the police?</i>

02:12.460 --> 02:14.660
Pink Idol, big deal.

02:16.860 --> 02:22.740
<i>Pink Idol! Pink Idol!</i>

02:24.310 --> 02:26.040
He looks familiar.

02:27.150 --> 02:29.370
Where have I seen him before?

02:47.060 --> 02:48.870
Express deliveryman?

02:51.800 --> 02:55.840
It wasn't a hardcore fan who
did it? It was a Pink Idol fan?

03:07.220 --> 03:07.950
-=Lee Ju Ho=-

03:23.000 --> 03:25.200
So you disguised yourself as
an express deliveryman.

03:25.570 --> 03:27.770
You're dead.

03:46.490 --> 03:47.960
What are you doing?

03:49.790 --> 03:51.630
From the beginning...

03:52.360 --> 03:57.500
when I studied your cases,
it made me curious.

03:58.230 --> 04:01.170
Just what is your secret?
How do you do it?

04:01.540 --> 04:03.000
Now I think I understand a little.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.670
What do you mean by that?

04:08.140 --> 04:12.910
I know the spirits of the dead
don't actually appear.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.579
But since they may not know
they're dead,

04:17.690 --> 04:19.890
even if one could appear,

04:19.890 --> 04:22.820
they're not able to communicate
as if they were alive.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.030
So if they want to convey
a message,

04:25.030 --> 04:27.270
it's just like what happened in
the elevator.

04:27.510 --> 04:29.700
Is it correct? My analysis?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.070
That's what you've been thinking?

04:34.370 --> 04:38.610
Your analysis isn't unreasonable,
but it's incomplete.

04:38.610 --> 04:43.750
Spirits can appear and not all
of them don't speak.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.220
Ajussi, I have big news.

04:56.370 --> 04:58.590
It turns out the stalker
tormenting my oppa is...

04:58.610 --> 04:59.720
Is who?

04:59.770 --> 05:02.830
It's not a hardcore fan of my oppa.
It's a Pink Idol stalker!

05:03.200 --> 05:05.030
He was disguised as an
express deliveryman.

05:05.030 --> 05:06.870
This is so awesome.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.700
So what?

05:08.840 --> 05:10.540
Are you deaf?

05:10.660 --> 05:14.210
I know who it is! Hurry.
Bring him in. Handcuffs.

05:14.210 --> 05:16.040
I don't have time to play with you.

05:21.180 --> 05:23.020
You have to help me catch him,
seriously.

05:23.130 --> 05:24.610
Put him in handcuffs.

05:26.690 --> 05:28.160
Hey, Detective Yun.

05:28.890 --> 05:29.990
How's it going?

05:31.460 --> 05:34.400
I can't find Lee Min Gyeong
on the CCTV recording.

05:34.490 --> 05:36.060
No one has seen her.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.350
You know...

05:40.390 --> 05:42.470
maybe her phone was turned on

05:42.470 --> 05:45.770
because someone found it and
tried to contact the owner.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.030
That could be possible.

05:47.060 --> 05:49.440
Regarding that building,
I'll look into it further.

05:49.570 --> 05:50.910
Building?

05:51.930 --> 05:52.920
Hey.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.580
Did you...

05:55.150 --> 05:59.350
That... You saw that, right?

05:59.350 --> 06:00.750
Could it be...

06:01.190 --> 06:02.660
a spirit?

06:05.350 --> 06:10.370
The building has some unusual
features, and many people claim
to have seen a ghost.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.700
A lot of the tenants have
moved out.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.140
Oh, how interesting.

06:15.180 --> 06:17.420
So there must definitely be
a problem there.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.640
Earlier, you said you didn't find
anything on the CCTV.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.480
Just keep quiet, kid.

06:22.580 --> 06:23.950
That jabbering...

06:25.270 --> 06:26.880
You think it will be scary?

06:27.980 --> 06:34.220
Well, I'll continue investigating
witnesses with Jong Hyeon.

06:34.220 --> 06:38.260
You and... you, go ahead and
investigate that building then.

06:38.260 --> 06:39.100
Sure.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.660
Sorry, but I'm not going
into that building.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.500
I'm scared to death.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.000
Go away!

06:56.240 --> 06:57.700
-=Tenant Identity Confirmation=-

06:59.550 --> 07:00.790
-=Accepted Case Report=-

07:05.940 --> 07:07.360
What happened?

07:07.520 --> 07:09.090
Did you find out?

07:09.970 --> 07:11.170
Where?

07:12.390 --> 07:13.700
Okay.

07:16.560 --> 07:20.090
Detective Yun, come look at this.

07:23.570 --> 07:24.330
What is it?

07:24.340 --> 07:29.640
A year ago, the building manager,
Han Jae Sang, was under
investigation for theft.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.750
A theft suspect?

07:32.010 --> 07:34.450
This is the case report.

07:34.700 --> 07:38.820
Some narcotic drugs were stolen
from the clinic on the 2nd floor.

07:38.820 --> 07:42.770
You go find Han Jae Sang.
I have somewhere to go.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.800
If you find anything new,
let me know right away.

07:47.630 --> 07:48.730
Okay.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.270
Don't move!

10:16.640 --> 10:18.110
What?

10:25.260 --> 10:27.530
Such a timid detective.

10:28.390 --> 10:31.220
So, what do you want to know
about this building?

10:31.280 --> 10:33.530
I've heard strange things about
the building,

10:33.590 --> 10:35.730
and people have disappeared,

10:35.770 --> 10:37.850
so I have a few questions.

10:44.540 --> 10:47.710
I knew there was going to
be trouble.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.620
What does that mean?

10:53.350 --> 10:55.180
<i>A curse?</i>

10:58.490 --> 11:06.560
<i>10 years ago, on the site where
this building was being built,</i>

11:06.930 --> 11:10.600
<i>there was a power struggle
within a gang and many people
died.</i>

11:10.600 --> 11:13.170
<i>But the bodies were never found.</i>

11:13.170 --> 11:15.370
<i>You've been drinking too much.</i>

11:17.200 --> 11:20.710
<i>Where did they all go?</i>

11:21.440 --> 11:23.430
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

11:29.480 --> 11:31.150
<i>Don't you hear the sound
of weeping?</i>

11:31.250 --> 11:36.290
<i>I bury it with alcohol. </i>

11:37.480 --> 11:39.100
<i>Here.</i>

11:39.590 --> 11:41.060
<i>There.</i>

11:41.800 --> 11:43.630
<i>Over there.</i>

11:47.430 --> 11:52.810
<i>I used to be in the Wang Shimi
gang.</i>

12:00.220 --> 12:05.820
<i>Not long after, that guard
suddenly died of a heart attack.</i>

12:05.900 --> 12:08.740
Later, some people started
claiming they had seen a ghost,

12:08.960 --> 12:11.550
and one after another, they
have left this place.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.030
If I had been healthy, I would
be gone, too.

12:18.870 --> 12:24.100
In the past, you were investigated
for stealing medicine.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.610
Just the thought of that seems
so ridiculous.

12:37.100 --> 12:41.260
They accused me of stealing
narcotics, when I only stole a
few packs of cigarettes.

12:41.310 --> 12:44.190
How would I know which ones
are narcotics?

12:44.190 --> 12:46.680
What would I have done
with them?

12:49.700 --> 12:51.990
But what was so strange,

12:52.400 --> 12:55.570
nobody saw me, and there were
no cameras.

12:56.670 --> 12:59.850
How did they know it was me?

13:16.020 --> 13:18.170
<i>This is just a big scam.</i>

13:18.330 --> 13:19.320
<i>I mean,</i>

13:19.480 --> 13:21.630
<i>what else can you call it when
you just run into me?</i>

13:22.360 --> 13:25.210
<i>What you're saying is just
nonsense.</i>

13:25.300 --> 13:28.600
You came out of the parking
garage and hit me.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.170
Seriously, this is ridiculous.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.270
<i>I'm taking this for evidence.</i>

13:32.640 --> 13:36.170
I'm sure you don't want anyone
to know what you were doing here.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.780
What about this...

13:37.780 --> 13:39.560
Let's negotiate a settlement.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.180
Right, Oppa.

13:42.180 --> 13:46.340
Don't go to the police station.
Just give him some money.

13:46.450 --> 13:52.460
Lying bastards like this, it's
better to teach them a lesson.

13:52.460 --> 13:53.930
Let's just discuss this, okay?

13:53.940 --> 13:55.760
- I caught you.
- Let's talk!

13:56.130 --> 13:57.600
Let's talk! Let's talk!

14:02.000 --> 14:03.470
Hey, Dog Nose!

14:06.040 --> 14:08.610
See what you can find out
about this building.

14:08.610 --> 14:09.710
Even something trivial.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.380
Do you want to quit your job
and open a chicken shop?

14:15.220 --> 14:17.050
Call me after you ask around.

14:18.150 --> 14:21.820
If you don't take my calls,
then you'll really be dead.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.060
Yes, Detective Jeong.

14:30.630 --> 14:32.100
Wang Shimi gang?

14:59.630 --> 15:00.730
Hello?

15:01.460 --> 15:02.560
It's me.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.400
Right now, someone's following...

15:15.780 --> 15:17.240
No.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.080
I guess I'm too sensitive.

15:19.810 --> 15:21.280
Yeah.

16:20.510 --> 16:23.440
-=Gim Hui Yeon=-

16:26.380 --> 16:27.850
Her name is Gim Hui Yeon.

16:27.850 --> 16:28.950
Age 24.

16:29.160 --> 16:33.720
After the Busan Christian
fellowship ended at 1:00 a.m.,

16:34.090 --> 16:36.080
she disappeared on the way home.

16:37.020 --> 16:43.260
Gim Hui Yeon and our victim
from the gravel road were
similar in age and build.

16:43.260 --> 16:44.360
What else?

16:45.470 --> 16:51.340
This time, we didn't find any
clues at the scene, either.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.880
Why does our first case here
have to be so difficult?

17:01.250 --> 17:03.200
It's driving me crazy.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.920
I knew it would be like this.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.490
Special Case Investigation
team. Bullshit.

17:08.220 --> 17:10.220
If had listened to Song Hak Go,

17:10.790 --> 17:14.089
I wouldn't have gotten involved
in this.

18:05.310 --> 18:09.600
How long are you going to look
at that? Turn the page!

18:09.780 --> 18:11.920
You're so slow.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.790
Did you hand in the team
assistance documents?

18:15.790 --> 18:17.170
You forgot, didn't you?

18:17.260 --> 18:19.250
The fax said it had to be today.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.700
It's my oppas!

18:28.270 --> 18:29.370
Seonbae.

18:29.430 --> 18:33.640
The building owner has been
sued for sexual harassment before.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.280
Gim Jeong Chan?

18:39.280 --> 18:40.270
Yes.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.350
Yeah, how's it going?

18:48.820 --> 18:53.960
My former cellmate knows some
guys in the construction business.

18:55.430 --> 18:59.830
That friend is really plugged into
all the news out there.

18:59.830 --> 19:04.970
What you said about that building
being built by mobsters 12 years
ago was correct.

19:05.340 --> 19:06.290
Really?

19:06.310 --> 19:11.940
They opened an illegal casino
and made some money, but
then ended up in prison.

19:13.050 --> 19:14.510
Illegal casino?

19:14.710 --> 19:18.550
So then, that building used to
have an illegal casino in it?

19:18.550 --> 19:22.590
=He said that building has been
through 5 or 6 owners.=

19:22.600 --> 19:26.630
=The present owner remodeled
everything after he took over.=

19:26.700 --> 19:28.830
Okay. Good work.

19:28.830 --> 19:33.600
If that building has a secret room
in it that no one knows about,

19:34.330 --> 19:36.170
and Lee Min Gyeong...

19:38.540 --> 19:39.840
Wait a minute!

19:39.840 --> 19:42.920
~ <i>Never let it go.</i> ~

19:44.240 --> 19:45.710
~ <i>I...</i> ~

19:49.750 --> 19:51.580
~ <i>Only you.</i> ~

20:19.480 --> 20:21.310
What's she doing?

20:34.530 --> 20:36.000
Detective Jeong!

20:36.730 --> 20:37.830
Let's go investigate this together.

20:38.930 --> 20:42.240
My whole body is suddenly
feeling different.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.440
I should do some stretching.

20:45.170 --> 20:46.270
You go ahead first.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.470
I have something urgent to do.

21:00.220 --> 21:01.320
Hey.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.790
Are you happy? You like it?

21:04.260 --> 21:05.730
What do you mean?

21:05.730 --> 21:06.830
I'm leaving.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.860
What happened? What did you do?

21:12.090 --> 21:13.070
Isn't it obvious?

21:13.070 --> 21:17.100
I don't know what happened!
My oppas were on TV.

21:17.470 --> 21:19.310
I just wanted to be like I used to...

21:20.770 --> 21:22.610
Don't cause trouble.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.180
Come with me.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.750
Loyalty!

21:27.750 --> 21:31.420
Thanks to Detective Yun, I'm
reporting today, Han Tae Gyeong.

21:31.780 --> 21:33.620
That's great.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.090
Go on in.

21:35.820 --> 21:36.920
<i>Yes. I understand.</i>

21:38.760 --> 21:43.160
Please save me. He's
kidnapping me.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.610
<i>Where are you going?</i>

22:07.390 --> 22:08.390
Hey!

22:23.900 --> 22:25.610
What are you doing now?

22:27.940 --> 22:30.510
This is my favorite style.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.600
Do you have a size larger
than this?

22:34.940 --> 22:37.850
I think that size will fit you.

22:38.220 --> 22:42.990
It's for my younger sister.
She's a bit more...

22:43.360 --> 22:44.820
Do you really want to die?

22:44.820 --> 22:48.860
I helped you solve a case and
you promised to treat me, no
matter what.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.430
Here you go.

22:51.430 --> 22:52.900
Thank you.

22:55.100 --> 22:56.940
Sweetie.

23:05.380 --> 23:05.750
You just wait.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.960
Hey. You're not coming out yet?

23:19.330 --> 23:21.530
Just wait. I'm trying on clothes.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.000
Hey, high school student.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.200
If you're not out by the time I
count to 3, you're dead.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.410
One. Two.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.160
Okay, I'm out.

23:28.190 --> 23:29.170
So petty.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.600
And I'm not a high school
student!

23:31.620 --> 23:33.830
<i>I have a name, Han Na Yeong!</i>

23:34.010 --> 23:36.580
<i>You always call me that.</i>

23:38.870 --> 23:40.570
<i>That brat, seriously.</i>

23:57.250 --> 23:58.880
Seriously.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.170
Where did she go?

24:19.770 --> 24:21.460
It's all fixed.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.920
You can finish up.

24:33.780 --> 24:35.670
What are you doing here?

24:38.340 --> 24:41.710
I thought they were so cute.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.010
Would you like to hold one?

24:43.010 --> 24:44.480
No.

24:44.670 --> 24:48.880
That's okay. I might scare them.

24:49.810 --> 24:51.150
Hey, what are you doing here?

24:51.170 --> 24:52.180
Are you crazy?

24:53.030 --> 24:56.220
These dogs were just so cute.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.300
Where are we going?

25:06.130 --> 25:09.800
Be quiet and stop talking,
understand?

25:17.980 --> 25:20.080
What a question.

25:20.250 --> 25:23.020
It's an old building, so of course
it needed remodeling.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.350
Am I not supposed to spend
my money?

25:28.670 --> 25:34.560
Were you aware this building was
originally a cover for an illegal
casino?

25:34.760 --> 25:37.330
Illegal casino...

25:37.440 --> 25:39.170
What nonsense are you
talking about?

25:39.170 --> 25:42.100
So during the remodeling, you
never found any unusual areas.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.300
Exactly what are you trying
to ask?

25:44.410 --> 25:47.750
I'd like to see the blueprints
for this building.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.180
Blueprints.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.580
If you want to see those,
bring a warrant.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.150
This is my final warning to you.

25:57.150 --> 26:01.190
If you drop in casually to
investigate again, I will take
legal measures.

26:01.190 --> 26:02.420
Be aware of that.

26:17.750 --> 26:21.370
Does your partner give you
a big headache?

26:21.370 --> 26:23.210
Sort of.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.250
He has a bad personality.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.380
I hope I will see you again
sometime,

26:32.380 --> 26:34.120
Detective Han Na Yeong.

26:56.300 --> 26:59.670
Wait, how did he know
my name?

27:49.700 --> 27:52.400
I said speak to my lawyer.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.970
Can't you see this?

27:55.330 --> 27:57.540
Did your lawyer have a way
to do this?

27:57.540 --> 28:01.210
To protect my building, I installed
several cameras. Is that a
problem?

28:01.210 --> 28:03.610
Protect? Protect, my ass.

28:27.910 --> 28:29.610
What's wrong with her?

28:29.840 --> 28:32.520
Did a hungry ghost enter
her body?

28:34.610 --> 28:36.440
You must be hungry, right?

28:37.180 --> 28:38.640
I'm so full.

28:40.110 --> 28:44.600
I just don't understand how she
can suddenly be like this.

28:48.190 --> 28:50.110
Is that already the signal?

28:53.330 --> 28:57.000
Getting emptied after 10 years
really feels great!

29:27.460 --> 29:29.990
What happened?

29:30.150 --> 29:31.800
Did I come out?

30:02.470 --> 30:05.290
Was I just kicked out by
black bean sauce?

30:18.970 --> 30:20.310
Hey!

30:21.420 --> 30:22.880
Yes.

30:23.620 --> 30:24.720
I'm sorry.

30:24.720 --> 30:28.390
I was just wondering what the
best way to enter a body was...

30:30.960 --> 30:33.160
Are you all right?

30:36.100 --> 30:38.660
I seem a little strange, don't I?

30:39.530 --> 30:41.020
<i>I...</i>

30:41.600 --> 30:44.900
Did you happen to see
anything around me?

30:45.640 --> 30:47.110
See what?

30:47.110 --> 30:48.600
What do you mean?

30:49.460 --> 30:52.980
Nothing. I'll tell you later.

31:00.420 --> 31:01.790
Hey.

31:22.140 --> 31:24.800
I already said it's not that
building.

31:24.910 --> 31:28.210
Yun seonbae, use some
common sense.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.770
Even with just the gravel case,
carrying such a big box,

31:31.770 --> 31:34.340
how could he go in and out
without being on the CCTV?

31:34.340 --> 31:35.460
Don't you agree?

31:38.380 --> 31:40.580
<i>It turns out the stalker
tormenting my oppa is...</i>

31:40.690 --> 31:43.260
<i>He was disguised as an
express deliveryman.</i>

31:43.260 --> 31:45.100
<i>This is so awesome.</i>

31:45.460 --> 31:48.030
Someone who can walk in and
out of a building,

31:48.400 --> 31:53.170
avoid CCTV cameras and carry
boxes without suspicion.

32:00.150 --> 32:01.250
Express delivery.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.080
Express delivery...

32:03.820 --> 32:06.390
That's a pretty good theory.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.950
Then could...

32:10.060 --> 32:12.620
<i>How would I know which ones
are narcotics?</i>

32:12.990 --> 32:14.830
<i>But what was so strange,</i>

32:15.560 --> 32:18.500
<i>nobody saw me, and there were
no cameras.</i>

32:19.970 --> 32:22.530
<i>How did they know it was me?</i>

32:23.640 --> 32:25.100
The clinic locker room!

32:25.100 --> 32:26.570
- You have that file, right?
- Yes.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.410
- Find it and see.
- Okay.

32:33.180 --> 32:36.480
That's the locker room and the
clinic's drug storage!

32:36.480 --> 32:40.150
The clinic reported to the police
that narcotics had been stolen.

32:40.520 --> 32:43.090
If the deliveryman was the
suspect, then somewhere...

32:46.020 --> 32:48.230
Look at this.

32:48.590 --> 32:51.160
Someone came in very early
in the morning.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.570
<i>Stop.</i>

32:57.040 --> 32:57.770
That's it!

32:58.140 --> 32:59.610
Quickly investigate that
deliveryman's identity.

32:59.610 --> 33:00.710
- I understand.
- Okay!

33:03.640 --> 33:04.740
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

33:05.110 --> 33:06.950
Jin Myeong Gi, age 34.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.780
He has 2 convictions for assault
and drugs.

33:08.780 --> 33:09.520
What about the delivery van
license plate number?

33:09.880 --> 33:10.980
Seoul 9108.

33:11.350 --> 33:15.020
See if you can find that delivery
van on the CCTV from around
the gravel road site.

33:15.020 --> 33:15.750
I found it.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.320
On June 4th in Yeomchang-dong.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.790
That's not an express
delivery area.

33:21.260 --> 33:24.560
That guy is really suspicious.

33:24.930 --> 33:25.660
Where is he now?

33:25.660 --> 33:28.600
He just left to make a delivery
to that commercial building.

33:32.270 --> 33:33.010
Let's go.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.110
Yes.

34:25.620 --> 34:26.719
He should still be in this building,

34:27.090 --> 34:28.190
so let's spread out.

34:28.190 --> 34:28.929
Yes.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.090
Sublevel 4?

36:06.190 --> 36:08.390
What did you say?
What 4th sublevel?

36:08.760 --> 36:10.600
There are only 3 sublevels here.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.470
An illegal construction.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.990
Ajussi.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.190
What are you doing here?

37:45.290 --> 37:48.960
I don't have a box, so...

38:07.310 --> 38:10.980
You shouldn't do things like this.

38:42.180 --> 38:43.740
<i>Excuse me!</i>

38:45.480 --> 38:47.320
<i>Is anyone here?</i>

38:52.090 --> 38:56.860
Oh, you were... here earlier.

38:56.970 --> 38:58.560
Is something wrong?

38:59.890 --> 39:01.420
I'm a police officer.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.470
I heard something in here.

39:04.690 --> 39:09.570
Has an express deliveryman
been here today?

39:09.800 --> 39:12.510
No, haven't seen him today.

39:12.510 --> 39:14.860
Why are you looking for him?

39:23.600 --> 39:27.560
I had an emergency surgery.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.670
Oh. Excuse me.

40:07.820 --> 40:11.600
<i>Just now, Gim Hui Yeon used
Morse code to send an SOS. </i>

40:43.540 --> 40:45.100
Excuse me.

41:58.040 --> 42:01.710
Why do you waste your energy?
It's exhausting.

42:22.630 --> 42:25.200
Please, spare me! Please!

42:25.200 --> 42:27.410
Please, spare me!

42:29.610 --> 42:33.280
Spare your life for what?

42:34.380 --> 42:35.850
What good is it?

42:37.140 --> 42:39.150
It's boring.

42:39.710 --> 42:41.720
Your life is meaningless.

42:43.190 --> 42:46.180
Spare me! Please!

43:12.550 --> 43:19.520
You will be reborn as the world's
most beautiful woman.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.030
Look.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.330
Beautiful, right?

43:29.430 --> 43:32.010
After that body is yours,

43:33.840 --> 43:39.710
your life will become very
meaningful for me.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.880
Gim Hui Yeon! Gim Hui Yeon!

45:22.250 --> 45:25.650
Seonbae said they haven't
found him.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.220
<i>He was able to get away.</i>

45:28.490 --> 45:31.060
If we had been one step earlier...

46:12.160 --> 46:15.100
<i>Lee Cheol Gyu, age 34.
No criminal record.</i>

46:15.100 --> 46:19.100
<i>He graduated veterinary college
in 2008 and had worked at an
animal shelter. </i>

46:20.100 --> 46:23.010
<i>We found these photos in
Lee Cheol Gyu's home. </i>

46:23.170 --> 46:28.640
<i>As shown in the diagram, he had
spent more than a year studying
similar-sized women.</i>

46:28.680 --> 46:31.980
He had studied a total of
29 women.

46:31.980 --> 46:36.020
Besides Gim Hui Yeon, there
were 2 bodies found in that
basement.

46:36.020 --> 46:39.320
Packed in a box was the
dismembered body of Lee Min
Gyeong.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.400
As expected, there were no feet.

46:41.450 --> 46:43.730
Also, there was the express
deliveryman, Gim Byeong Gyu.

46:43.730 --> 46:47.590
In his pocket, we found several
types of narcotic medication.

46:47.610 --> 46:50.330
He was probably killed while
stealing them.

46:50.330 --> 46:54.370
Then, if Gim Hui Yeon's head
was the last piece, did he fail?

46:55.110 --> 46:56.940
Oh, that's so creepy!

46:58.110 --> 47:03.550
But how did Lee Cheol Gyu get
Gim Byeong Gyu to store the
bodies in the private vaults?

47:03.550 --> 47:05.380
He probably paid him to do it.

47:05.510 --> 47:08.320
Gim Byeong Gyu didn't know
what was inside.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.520
So what was this guy's motive?

47:10.890 --> 47:15.660
As the diagram shows, Lee Cheol
Gyu had a beauty obsession.

47:15.660 --> 47:21.120
To put it simply, he was an
obsessive-compulsive and
dedicated to beauty.

47:21.360 --> 47:25.570
According to his own standards,
he assembled a female body

47:25.570 --> 47:28.140
that he could keep at his side
forever.

47:44.660 --> 47:47.590
-=Hui Yeon, tomorrow we're
finally going to meet. Can't wait!=-

48:19.520 --> 48:20.620
-=Medical Report,Gim Hui Yeon=-

48:20.620 --> 48:23.190
-=April 7, 2014. First visit to clinic.
Rash caused by cat hair.
Prescription, cetirizine HCI 10 mg.
2014.06.25, 2nd visit for skin rash.

for cetirizine HCI 5 mg=-

48:32.370 --> 48:34.370
This isn't Gim Hui Yeon.

48:34.940 --> 48:36.770
What bullshit is that?

48:36.860 --> 48:38.900
How is that not Gim Hui Yeon?

48:41.180 --> 48:44.110
What? Twins?

48:44.230 --> 48:47.050
Gim Hui Yeon is allergic
to cat hair.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.890
Lee Cheol Gyu also wrote it in
his records.

48:48.890 --> 48:52.190
This is Gim Hui Yeon's allergy
medicine.

48:52.630 --> 48:54.760
That's weird.

48:55.340 --> 48:57.490
There's no record of any
family members.

48:57.510 --> 48:59.400
I found her records.

48:59.530 --> 49:03.920
Gim Hui Yeon and her twin sister,
Gim Hui Su, were placed in an
orphanage at age 4.

49:03.930 --> 49:07.090
One year later, Gim Hui Su was
adopted to the United States.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.710
She's now living in Los Angeles.

49:08.710 --> 49:09.440
What?

49:09.510 --> 49:12.010
What the heck is this?

49:12.010 --> 49:13.330
What is what?

49:14.100 --> 49:16.600
Someone is using
Gim Hui Yeon's phone.

49:16.780 --> 49:18.100
Again?

49:19.600 --> 49:20.820
Look at this.

49:20.820 --> 49:22.650
After Gim Hui Yeon's death,
there was a text message.

49:22.650 --> 49:23.390
After Gim Hui Yeon's death,
there was a text message.
.
-=From Gim Hui Su. My flight
lands at 5:00...=-

49:23.390 --> 49:25.220
The last text was 13 hours ago.
.
-=From Gim Hui Su. My flight
lands at 5:00...=-

49:25.220 --> 49:25.420
The last text was 13 hours ago.

49:25.430 --> 49:26.690
That's today!

49:26.690 --> 49:27.790
Lee Cheol Gyu.

49:27.790 --> 49:29.080
What time is it?

49:32.740 --> 49:36.090
<i>Sister, I'm here. Hui Yeon,
where are you?</i>

49:53.950 --> 49:57.110
<i>I'm sorry. Something urgent
came up suddenly.</i>

49:57.110 --> 49:59.360
<i>I asked a very close oppa to
pick you up.</i>

49:59.360 --> 50:01.790
<i>He will drive you here to me.</i>

50:17.710 --> 50:20.660
New text messages were just
sent and received.

50:21.750 --> 50:23.950
It seems like Lee Cheol Gyu
has met Gim Hui Su.

50:24.310 --> 50:26.520
Damn it, one step late again.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.090
It's not too late yet, Kid!

50:29.090 --> 50:30.920
Track his position and follow him.

50:30.920 --> 50:33.120
Those 2 people are moving
together now!

50:33.120 --> 50:34.220
What?

50:35.690 --> 50:37.530
That bastard.

50:51.110 --> 50:55.880
What is your relationship with
Hui Yeon?

50:57.350 --> 50:59.110
I'm her very close oppa.

51:00.650 --> 51:01.880
What?

51:01.940 --> 51:03.590
Don't I seem like it?

51:04.320 --> 51:05.630
It's not that.

51:19.370 --> 51:21.450
<i>Hui Yeon, what's wrong?</i>

51:21.570 --> 51:22.940
<i>Are you okay?</i>

51:23.410 --> 51:26.110
<i>I don't know why, but I feel
very uneasy.</i>

51:26.130 --> 51:27.620
<i>Give me a call.</i>

51:45.430 --> 51:46.900
What?

51:47.360 --> 51:50.200
<i>You don't know why, but you
feel very uneasy?</i>

52:18.130 --> 52:20.300
We just lost her phone signal!

52:21.400 --> 52:23.010
Lee Cheol Gyu, that bastard!

52:26.170 --> 52:27.640
Who are you?

52:28.810 --> 52:30.860
<i>Where was the last signal from?</i>

52:30.890 --> 52:32.370
The entrance to highway 39.

52:32.410 --> 52:33.880
Toward Bucheon.

52:40.140 --> 52:42.540
It's lucky that you're twins.

52:43.860 --> 52:46.570
Now I get another chance.

52:54.660 --> 52:56.630
Isn't it pretty?

52:57.000 --> 53:02.510
Now, it only needs your lovely
face to be complete.

53:06.910 --> 53:09.480
In a moment, it will all be over.

54:00.130 --> 54:02.700
The last time they appeared on
CCTV was in this neighborhood.

54:02.700 --> 54:03.800
Investigate it carefully.

54:03.800 --> 54:04.980
<i>Yes.</i>

54:05.260 --> 54:06.370
<i>Let's go.</i>

54:21.420 --> 54:23.470
Don't get excited, come here.

54:27.660 --> 54:29.130
Stay away from me!

54:29.860 --> 54:31.700
You'll get hurt. Put it down.

54:31.900 --> 54:34.250
What did you do to my sister?

54:38.300 --> 54:40.140
What are you doing?

54:40.240 --> 54:41.240
You're not putting it down?

54:41.240 --> 54:43.070
Where is my sister, Hui Yeon?

54:43.070 --> 54:44.540
Where is she?

55:08.030 --> 55:11.100
You think I will lose my
chance again?

55:28.590 --> 55:31.390
Ajussi, here! Hurry!

57:36.310 --> 57:39.380
You screwed everything up!
You screwed everything up!

57:44.020 --> 57:45.880
I have to take care of you.

57:50.630 --> 57:51.930
What's that?

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:55.100
When I was young, I was
always sick for no reason.

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:58.300
So I invited a spirit from heaven
to come into me.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:03.690
Afterward, I didn't remember
anything for a while.

01:01:04.790 --> 01:01:08.460
I heard that afterward, I was
a completely different person.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:12.650
That was the first time I
experienced being possessed.

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:15.070
Is that so?

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:18.000
What can I do? I guess you
don't care.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.750
What are you trying to say?

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:24.610
A clever ghost detective
entered a detective's body.

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.030
How about it? Not bad, right?

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.300
What are you two doing?

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.720
Come in and drink with us.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:39.570
Seonbae, hurry and come, too.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:45.750
She's sweet and pretty.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.100
I think I like her more and more.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.160
Nothing like you.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.330
Didn't you say she was all
made with plastic surgery?

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.760
Didn't you say I was breaking
my own rules?

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:56.390
Whatever, you sure do hold
a grudge.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.710
So that stalker,

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.100
I heard he was caught.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.250
He apologized and they were so
cool to forgive him.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.350
My oppas.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.900
That's fantastic.

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:10.850
What was that called?
Ajussi, I know you did it.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.790
Anyway, I still think you're petty.

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:16.430
Thank you. ajussi.

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.890
I love you.

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.800
That crazy...

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:42.420
It should be fully verified.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:54.770
Okay, now... it begins, right?

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:57.530
Yes.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:56.720
Who are you? Why did you
bring me here?

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.290
Why?

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.740
You bastard!

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.300
How could you do this to me?

01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:10.510
Tell me why!

double life. </i>

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:10.750
<i>A strange death.</i>

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.880

01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:14.460

by a ghost.</i>

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.920

<i>Who sent you?</i>

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.720

asshole made me like this.</i>

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:21.880

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:24.620
<i>I will give you anything.</i>

01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:25.750
<i>Please give me the drugs.</i>

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.400
