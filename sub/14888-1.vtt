run by the state

03:05.566 --> 03:07.266

for the schools.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.033
Now, you see, you pick six
numbers

03:09.066 --> 03:12.666

you could win $28 million.

about the lottery?

03:38.733 --> 03:40.266
Oh, sure, Balki.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.800
The lottery is a scam
run by the state

who didn't show up

I've got twenty bucks

12:12.466 --> 12:14.733
I'll go out,
buy twenty tickets

12:14.766 --> 12:18.100
and whatever I win
we'll split 50‐50.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.300
So, now you
like the lottery?

12:21.333 --> 12:22.500
Oh, I do, I do.

12:24.366 --> 12:26.133
That's funny because

12:26.166 --> 12:29.266
if memory serves me,
and I think it does.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.433
When we were in the store,
I recall you told me

12:32.466 --> 12:35.533
that if I were to look up
the word "Sucker"

12:35.566 --> 12:38.433
in a dictionary,
my picture would be there.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.033
Balki..

12:43.066 --> 12:46.133
...please, please, please.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.800
I want to be rich.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.266
[mumbling]

12:49.300 --> 12:50.600
Cousin

12:50.633 --> 12:53.000
I'm just playing a game
of cat and louse with you.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.166
Of course, I share
my jackpot with you.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.166
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.133
In your face,
Donald Trump.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.433
Now..

13:04.466 --> 13:05.633
...where is
the lottery ticket?

13:07.466 --> 13:09.166
‐ I hide it.
‐ Good for you.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.633
Where did you hide it?

13:14.466 --> 13:15.433
Balki.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.400
Do you remember
where you hid it?

13:21.433 --> 13:22.600
Not right now.

13:24.566 --> 13:27.366
What do you mean
not right now?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
Where is it?

13:29.433 --> 13:33.133
Well, I hide it and then
I hide it again so many times

13:33.166 --> 13:36.200
that, that I forget
where I hide it last.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.033
[yelling]
You have got to remember.

13:39.066 --> 13:40.666
Alright, that's alright,
no problem.

13:40.700 --> 13:43.166
No problem.
Take your time.

13:43.200 --> 13:47.100
No hurry,
just try to think back.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.566
You put the ticket..

13:49.600 --> 13:52.033
‐ I put the ticket..
‐ You put the ticket..

13:52.066 --> 13:53.333
I put the ticket..

13:56.133 --> 13:58.100
...in my..

13:58.133 --> 14:00.133
You put the ticket in your..

14:02.833 --> 14:04.500
Winter coat.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.233
Winter coat.
There.

14:06.266 --> 14:07.266
[exhaling]

14:12.333 --> 14:13.566
Spring.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.800
Summer.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.033
Autumn.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.600
‐ Winter.
‐ Oh.

14:20.766 --> 14:22.700
[panting]

14:24.333 --> 14:26.666
‐ The ticket's not there.
‐ It's not there?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.200
Ha, I was sure
I put it in there.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.333
I‐I remember thinking
that I would put it

14:31.366 --> 14:33.600
either in my winter coat

14:33.633 --> 14:36.400
or...in a cereal box.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.333
Ah. Look, cousin.

14:53.366 --> 14:54.633
You found it.
You found it.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.566
What is it?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.566
It's the Captain Power
decoder ring.

15:05.233 --> 15:06.766
Now I have a complete set.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.733
Now you don't.

15:09.766 --> 15:11.333
Where is it?

15:11.366 --> 15:13.500
Think. Think.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.433
I can't think.

15:14.466 --> 15:17.133
I was up all night.
I don't get any sleep..

15:17.166 --> 15:18.300
[mumbling]

15:18.333 --> 15:20.033
Alright, alright,
alright, alright.

15:20.066 --> 15:22.800
Alright, just try
to remember.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.433
Try to remember.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.200
You had the ticket
in your hand.

15:26.233 --> 15:28.766
‐ Yes.
‐ You were in the apartment..

15:28.800 --> 15:31.566
‐ I was in the living room.
‐ In the living room..

15:31.600 --> 15:32.600
Alright, and then?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.333
I was watching TV.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.600
Over there.

15:39.833 --> 15:41.666
And then?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.666
I began to gaze
into the fire.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.300
[muttering]
Alright, okay.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.333
And then?

15:48.133 --> 15:50.566
I began to think of home.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.533
And then, and then,
and then?

15:55.333 --> 15:56.400
And then..

15:58.633 --> 16:00.166
...I don't remember.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.166
You don't remember

16:05.200 --> 16:08.033
where you hid
a lottery ticket

16:08.066 --> 16:10.800
worth $28 million?

16:10.833 --> 16:12.500
‐ Books.
‐ What about them?

16:12.533 --> 16:14.166
It's hidden behind the books.

16:24.766 --> 16:25.733
Wait a minute.

16:26.600 --> 16:27.766
Now that I think about it

16:27.800 --> 16:30.533
It's not behind the books.
It's in one of the books.

16:30.566 --> 16:32.433
Which one? It makes
a difference, you know?

16:34.533 --> 16:36.100
‐ Shakespeare.
‐ Shakespeare.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.166
Shakespeare, Shakespeare..

16:38.400 --> 16:40.033
‐ Comedies or tragedies?
‐ Sonnets.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.066
Sonnets.

16:43.266 --> 16:44.233
Oh, my God.

16:49.666 --> 16:50.633
It's not here.

16:50.666 --> 16:52.133
It's not there?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.133
[yelling]
Where is it?

16:59.166 --> 17:02.133
Think. Think.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.532
I can't think.
There's no air to my brain.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.133
Ha, ha, ha.

17:11.165 --> 17:12.333
Oh, that's better.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.500
I must have hidden it underneath
the corner of the carpet.

17:17.532 --> 17:19.532
Impossible. I would've found
it when I vacuumed.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.400
It's not in there.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.666
Alright, alright.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.233
Don't panic.

17:53.266 --> 17:54.666
Alright, it's gotta be
here somewhere.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.566
You take the kitchen.
I'll take the living room.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.100
The kitchen.
The kitchen, the kitchen.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.500
[knock on door]

18:08.533 --> 18:10.133
‐ Come in.
‐ Come in.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.166
Wow.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.133
You guys got eccentric fast.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.466
Larry, what happened?
Were you robbed?

18:22.266 --> 18:24.200
I lost a lottery ticket.

18:24.233 --> 18:25.700
[both sobbing]

18:29.100 --> 18:30.400
Well, easy come,
easy go.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.266
Well, listen, uh

18:36.300 --> 18:39.033
we have to work a flight
but we'll be back tonight

18:39.066 --> 18:40.500
and we'll just
help you find it.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.333
‐ Thank you.
‐ Thank you.

18:44.066 --> 18:47.066
Oh, Balki. Here's that envelope
you asked me to hold for you.

19:06.266 --> 19:07.266
Cousin

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
we're multiple
millionaires again.

19:11.566 --> 19:13.433
[both screaming]

19:28.133 --> 19:29.366
Hello, listen.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.700
I think if you just check the
numbers on our lottery ticket

19:31.733 --> 19:34.000
you'll find that we're the
lottery's newest millionaires.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.233
Large bills will be fine.

19:37.266 --> 19:39.500
Yeah. We issue checks
for anything over $100.

19:39.533 --> 19:41.200
Well, I guess this
is one check we won't be

19:41.233 --> 19:42.400
cashing at the "Quick Shop."

19:44.100 --> 19:46.133
Yeah, mind if I check
the numbers?

19:46.166 --> 19:49.633
We like to do that before we
hand over $28 million.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.233
‐ Oh, of course.
‐ Oh, of course.

19:52.666 --> 19:54.100
15, 15.

19:55.366 --> 19:56.400
32, 32.

19:57.566 --> 19:59.066
'52, 52.'

20:01.533 --> 20:02.666
21, 21.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.566
24, 27.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.733
Hold it.

20:06.766 --> 20:08.733
34, 37.

20:08.766 --> 20:11.533
N‐no, those aren't
the right numbers.

20:11.566 --> 20:13.733
You know, that same thought
just occurred to me.

20:13.766 --> 20:14.600
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.200
There's something wrong
here, you hear?

20:16.233 --> 20:17.300
Balki has the numbers written

20:17.333 --> 20:19.433
right on this piece of paper.

20:20.466 --> 20:21.533
‐ Yeah, 15
‐ Uh‐huh.

20:21.566 --> 20:25.266
32, 52, 21..

20:25.300 --> 20:26.566
Yeah, now, is that a four
or a seven?

20:26.600 --> 20:27.633
‐ Four.
‐ Seven.

20:27.666 --> 20:29.333
What do you mean a seven?

20:29.366 --> 20:31.600
Now, I can see how you might
think that it was a four.

20:31.633 --> 20:33.733
It's got that little line
through the middle.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.100
I also put that
through my "Z's"

20:36.133 --> 20:37.366
so that nobody thinks
they're two's.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.666
Who cares about your "Z's?"

20:38.700 --> 20:40.066
I want our money.

20:40.100 --> 20:42.333
Give me our $28 million.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.333
Sir, this ticket has
the wrong number.

20:44.366 --> 20:45.800
Who cares about this ticket?

20:45.833 --> 20:47.600
Look, look at this paper.

20:47.633 --> 20:50.033
It has got to be worth
at least a million.

20:50.066 --> 20:51.400
Cousin..

20:51.433 --> 20:54.233
Remember, reality
is your beat

20:54.266 --> 20:55.533
and the beat goes on.

20:56.766 --> 20:59.300
Wait, you, you did
match four numbers.

20:59.333 --> 21:00.533
You won $100.

21:00.566 --> 21:02.633
Thank you.
Very nice of you.

21:02.666 --> 21:05.100
‐ Come along, cousin.
‐ I don't want $100.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.700
‐ Isn't it nice?
‐ I want $28 million.

21:18.633 --> 21:20.700
That's the story of my life.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.600
What made me think
I could win the lottery?

21:30.666 --> 21:31.633
But, cousin.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.533
We did win the lottery.

21:37.133 --> 21:38.666
We picked four numbers
out of six.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.433
We won $100.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.500
Big deal.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.266
What's a $100?

21:43.300 --> 21:46.066
What's a $100?

21:46.100 --> 21:48.666
It's one pair of "Air Jordan"
basketball shoes.

21:51.566 --> 21:54.400
It's twenty trips to the top
of the "Sear's Tower."

21:58.366 --> 22:03.133
It's a four year subscription to
"Sports Illustrated" magazine

22:03.166 --> 22:05.233
which if we order now, includes

22:05.266 --> 22:07.566
the baseball preview
and the swimsuit issue.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.033
Balki.

22:17.666 --> 22:18.700
How do you do it?

22:19.566 --> 22:20.700
Cousin..

22:20.733 --> 22:23.733
...if you just take a little
postcard out of the magazine..

22:23.766 --> 22:26.066
No, no, no.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.066
No, no.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.500
I mean

22:29.533 --> 22:33.233
you see the $100 we won

22:33.266 --> 22:34.600
and I see

22:34.633 --> 22:40.066
the $27,999,900

22:40.100 --> 22:42.633
we lost.

22:42.666 --> 22:43.866
Well, now, cousin.

22:43.900 --> 22:48.266
You're comparing the $28 million
you thought you had yesterday

22:48.300 --> 22:51.400
with the $100
that you do have today.

22:51.433 --> 22:55.433
And I'm comparing the $100
that we do have today

22:55.466 --> 22:58.333
with the $100 we did
not have yesterday.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.566
Balki, you're right.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.400
You know, I guess..

23:11.433 --> 23:15.066
I see the glass half empty.

23:15.800 --> 23:19.400
And you, you, you..

23:19.433 --> 23:22.366
...always see
the glass half‐full.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.566
Cousin..

23:30.666 --> 23:32.766
...I don't see a glass
at all.

23:38.100 --> 23:41.033
[instrumental music]

23:43.766 --> 23:46.600
[theme music]

24:03.266 --> 24:06.200
[music continues]
