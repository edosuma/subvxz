That's what crossed my mind

when your police force
shot my friend Pey'j last night.

09:10.666 --> 09:13.791
Well, I mean, you're a terrorist
after all. What did you expect?

09:13.791 --> 09:15.791
[chuckles] Right back at you, friend.

13:43.791 --> 13:47.000
Wh-What have I done? I'm a monster!

13:47.000 --> 13:50.333
People will believe anything
when the truth is too hard to bear.

13:51.041 --> 13:54.333
Eden needed a friendly face
to deliver their propaganda.

13:55.041 --> 13:57.708
They... they used me?

13:57.708 --> 14:00.583
They lied to protect their interest.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.916
If anyone protests, they silence them.

14:03.916 --> 14:07.333
You... you should be careful, <i>mon ami</i>.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.291
[Rayman] Careful?

14:08.291 --> 14:10.708
Why? Am I in danger?

14:10.708 --> 14:11.875
- [door opens]
- [Rayman gasps]

14:11.875 --> 14:14.958
[Red] Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

14:16.833 --> 14:19.250
I've been lookin' everywhere for you.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.000
You filthy alien scum.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.166
[Rayman yells]

14:23.166 --> 14:24.791
- [punch lands]
- [Rayman groans]

14:24.791 --> 14:26.375
[coughing]

14:26.375 --> 14:27.708
[Red] Stay down!

14:27.708 --> 14:30.416
[Rayman sobbing, groaning]

14:31.291 --> 14:32.541
You coward.

14:32.541 --> 14:33.833
[Red] Shut the fuck up.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.291
Now get your ass moving.
We're taking you to court.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.833
History is kind to the just.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.958
[Red] Well, we'll just see
about that, won't we?

14:41.958 --> 14:43.041
[door closes]

14:43.833 --> 14:44.708
[Red] Shit!

14:44.708 --> 14:47.708
- [footsteps running]
- [Red panting]

14:47.708 --> 14:50.083
- [people chattering]
- [Red] Where the hell is he?

14:52.000 --> 14:54.791
Fuck! [echoing]

14:56.041 --> 14:58.750
[crickets chirping]

14:58.750 --> 15:03.375
[melancholic music resumes]

15:03.375 --> 15:04.333
[Dolph chuckles]

15:05.125 --> 15:06.500
I've missed this.

15:07.041 --> 15:09.166
Yeah. Me too.

15:10.916 --> 15:11.916
You know, this...

15:13.500 --> 15:14.875
this is all I ever wanted.

15:16.750 --> 15:20.625
I just wanted you, us, like this.

15:23.416 --> 15:27.791
- But then you went and fucked it all up.
- [sighs] I know. I'm sorry.

15:30.166 --> 15:32.083
I was so furious.

15:33.458 --> 15:36.291
I thought that killing you
would make it all better, but...

15:36.291 --> 15:37.375
it didn't.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.791
Quite the opposite.

15:42.666 --> 15:44.500
I guess I should've listened to him.

15:45.833 --> 15:46.666
Whom?

15:50.041 --> 15:53.458
The most ridiculous assassin
I have ever met in my life.

15:56.458 --> 15:57.666
Also the kindest.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.916
[waves crashing]

15:59.916 --> 16:03.666
[Dolph] "Be wary of the path
of vengeance," he said.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.333
Hmm. Wise words.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.166
And where is he now?

16:11.208 --> 16:12.041
I don't know.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.875
I just assumed that he was...

16:16.708 --> 16:19.000
Dead? Hmm. Maybe.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.500
Or maybe that frog needs you.

16:24.666 --> 16:25.500
[Dolph] I...

16:28.916 --> 16:31.041
[music continues]

16:31.791 --> 16:33.416
I need to get back to MegaCity.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.041
[Marcus] And leave all this?

16:38.250 --> 16:40.791
I thought there was nothing
for you out there.

16:43.000 --> 16:43.833
[Dolph] Yeah.

16:44.708 --> 16:46.500
There's not much for me out there.

16:47.416 --> 16:49.000
But this isn't about me.

16:50.791 --> 16:52.541
I left a man behind.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.250
[Marcus chuckles]

16:55.250 --> 16:59.250
[laughing]

16:59.250 --> 17:01.000
Oh, Laserhawk.

17:02.666 --> 17:04.041
You sound just like him.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.916
That good old Sam Fisher.

17:06.916 --> 17:10.041
He always had faith in people, you know.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.333
Hmm. Even in his psychotic daughter.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.708
You know,
I used to think like you, Holloway.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.416
But we all have our cross to bear.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.500
And Sarah Fisher had hers too.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.208
She may have put a bomb in my head,

17:27.208 --> 17:31.041
but at the end of the day,
I think she's all right.

17:36.083 --> 17:39.875
Well, you have a long journey
ahead of you, Laserhawk.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.083
I hope you'll find
what you're looking for.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.041
One step at a time.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.333
Right.

17:51.416 --> 17:53.166
One step at a time.

17:58.541 --> 18:01.041
[Dolph breathing heavily]

18:01.041 --> 18:04.000
[music continues]

18:20.583 --> 18:22.375
Good luck, Fisher.

18:22.375 --> 18:23.958
[music fades]

18:41.000 --> 18:42.916
[baby crying in distance]

18:50.875 --> 18:56.625
[Sarah groaning]

19:02.125 --> 19:02.958
[coughs]

19:06.208 --> 19:07.750
This isn't real.

19:08.666 --> 19:10.625
- This--
- Yes. This is what happened.

19:10.625 --> 19:12.625
It's the reality we created.

19:14.791 --> 19:16.208
So, Sarah,

19:16.958 --> 19:19.375
what is it you really wanted coming here?

19:20.625 --> 19:22.500
Tell me, and I'll make this quick.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.041
I told you the truth!

19:24.041 --> 19:26.958
Lies! I don't believe you.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.000
Of course you don't.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.541
I guess you never will.

19:33.208 --> 19:36.208
So now you can torture me.
You can kill me.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.208
It's all right. I deserve it.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.291
But, please, believe me when I say...

19:45.458 --> 19:47.625
I am sorry for what I did to you.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.375
I'm sorry.

20:03.541 --> 20:04.750
[inhales deeply]

20:12.458 --> 20:15.916
[Marcus] Well, well, well.
Little Sarah Fisher.

20:16.625 --> 20:19.458
I was looking forward
to watching you suffer

20:19.458 --> 20:23.500
in the same way
me and your father suffered because of you

20:23.500 --> 20:26.625
until I got tired of it
and put a bullet in your head.

20:31.208 --> 20:32.291
[button clicks]

20:32.916 --> 20:34.833
[Sarah grunts, groans]

20:38.916 --> 20:40.416
Why did you change your mind?

20:40.416 --> 20:44.500
Well, let's say that a certain
cyber soldier vouched for you

20:44.500 --> 20:50.291
and made me realize
that maybe people <i>can</i> change.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.458
- Laserhawk?
- [Marcus] Yeah.

20:54.291 --> 20:58.458
He's on his way to MegaCity
to save his frog, I believe.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.625
A good man.

21:00.708 --> 21:01.875
Yeah.

21:01.875 --> 21:06.041
Little Sarah,
if you are finally telling the truth,

21:06.041 --> 21:10.291
if Eden's forces are on their way
to take back the VR facility,

21:11.958 --> 21:13.541
I guess we got work to do.

21:19.125 --> 21:20.625
Yeah. You're right.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.750
I've got unfinished business here.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.083
[Marcus] Huh? What the...

21:29.000 --> 21:30.416
A virus?!

21:31.250 --> 21:32.208
You bitch!

21:32.208 --> 21:34.833
[tense darksynth music playing]

21:34.833 --> 21:36.000
[Marcus screams]

21:38.208 --> 21:40.875
[Sarah laughs]

21:40.875 --> 21:42.333
Really, Holloway,

21:42.333 --> 21:46.291
you should be more careful
about who you plug into your precious VR.

21:46.291 --> 21:48.041
You know what they say.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.416
Fool you once, shame on me.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.416
Fool you twice, shame on you.

21:53.416 --> 21:55.416
[music continues]
