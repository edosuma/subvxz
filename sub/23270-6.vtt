[Carlos Rafael]
My name is Carlos Rafael.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.997
I own a fleet in New Bedford.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.837
I consider myself the biggest player
right now on this industry.

02:52.380 --> 02:56.384
I employ, at the moment,
close to 300 fishermen.

02:57.468 --> 03:01.347
I have invested over $50 million
into this business.

03:02.932 --> 03:06.186
I'm not going down.
I'll be the last one fallen, rest assured.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.773
One standing up: me.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.755
Good afternoon. How are you?

29:59.422 --> 30:02.717
Tell me, is there any news
of the hand line catch?

30:03.051 --> 30:06.346
No, it hasn't been much, but long-liners
made a good catch yesterday.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.811
[Carlos Rafael]
I can get money through.

44:48.894 --> 44:51.230
I have one of the guys in Boston,

44:51.313 --> 44:54.900
one of those fucking agents,
who's my friend,

44:54.983 --> 44:58.278
and give him the money
before I go through security.
