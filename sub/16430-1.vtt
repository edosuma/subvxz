01:07.260 --> 01:09.093

02:11.806 --> 02:13.973
(sighing)

02:19.826 --> 02:22.576
(coins thudding)

02:25.125 --> 02:27.952
- Come on, pal, I'm
growing a beard over here.

02:27.952 --> 02:31.389
- I can never get these silly things.

02:31.389 --> 02:32.841
(change clattering)

02:32.841 --> 02:34.091
Thar she blows!

03:07.705 --> 03:09.406
- Excuse me.

03:09.406 --> 03:12.926
That wouldn't be your Rabbit
by any chance, would it?

03:12.926 --> 03:13.759
- Mine?

03:14.721 --> 03:15.843
Oh, no.

03:15.843 --> 03:17.042

03:17.042 --> 03:18.641
I was just, uh,

03:18.641 --> 03:21.224

03:23.670 --> 03:25.267
It's five dollars on number five.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.222
And your change, sir.

03:27.222 --> 03:28.389
- Jogged, huh?

03:29.862 --> 03:32.029
(sighing)

03:33.065 --> 03:33.898
- Come here!

03:33.898 --> 03:34.731
(screaming)

03:34.731 --> 03:35.884
Don't, don't, don't do it!

03:35.884 --> 03:36.840
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

03:36.840 --> 03:38.405
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:38.405 --> 03:39.849
- I'll blow a hole right through her, man!

03:39.849 --> 03:40.811

03:40.811 --> 03:41.958
- Let's not do nothin' stupid here now!

03:41.958 --> 03:42.796
- Oh, my god, don't hurt me!

03:42.796 --> 03:43.685
- Shut up!

03:43.685 --> 03:44.923
- Come on, buddy, now let her go, okay?

03:44.923 --> 03:47.280
We're just talking a stolen car here.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.717
Put the gun down.

03:48.717 --> 03:50.939
You don't wanna make things
worse for yourself, do ya, huh?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.403
- Things couldn't possibly
be worse for myself.

03:53.403 --> 03:54.595
Don't even think about it, hero!

03:54.595 --> 03:55.682
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:55.682 --> 03:59.201
- Now, you, join your partner over there.

03:59.201 --> 04:00.578
Keep your hands high.

04:00.578 --> 04:01.578
Both of you!

04:04.302 --> 04:05.784
Hey, you!

04:05.784 --> 04:07.117
Grab their guns!

04:10.422 --> 04:11.669
- Who, me?

04:11.669 --> 04:14.011
- Yes, you, you mutt!

04:14.011 --> 04:15.247
- Just take it easy.

04:15.247 --> 04:17.188
Think about what you're doing.

04:17.188 --> 04:19.075
- [Jack] What am I doing?

04:19.075 --> 04:20.468
- I won't go to jail for this?

04:20.468 --> 04:23.419
- No, you won't go to jail.

04:23.419 --> 04:24.507
- Now put 'em on the floor

04:24.507 --> 04:26.507
and kick 'em over to me.

04:37.147 --> 04:39.897
I said kick 'em over to me, Pele.

04:51.878 --> 04:52.711
Hey, hey!

04:52.711 --> 04:54.305
No, no, wrong!

04:54.305 --> 04:56.044
Tell you what.

04:56.044 --> 04:59.711
Pick up the goddamn
guns and hand 'em to me.

05:02.284 --> 05:03.534
By the barrels.

05:07.324 --> 05:10.705
(guns rattling)

05:10.705 --> 05:12.538
Put 'em in my pockets.

05:18.604 --> 05:20.104
Good boy, nickels.

05:22.659 --> 05:23.492
Damn it.

05:24.481 --> 05:27.314
All right, okay, now everybody,

05:27.314 --> 05:28.328
(gasping)

05:28.328 --> 05:29.331
on the floor!

05:29.331 --> 05:30.651
- You won't get away with this.

05:30.651 --> 05:32.773
- You don't know that.

05:32.773 --> 05:34.047
Faces flat!

05:34.047 --> 05:35.268
- [Natalie] Don't kill me!

05:35.268 --> 05:36.573
I don't wanna die!

05:36.573 --> 05:39.474
- [Jack] You won't if everybody
does exactly as I say.

05:39.474 --> 05:40.344
(gun firing)

05:40.344 --> 05:41.177
(Natalie screaming)

05:41.177 --> 05:42.135
- Holy shit!

05:42.135 --> 05:42.968
- Holy shit!

05:42.968 --> 05:43.927
- [Cop] Don't shoot!

05:43.927 --> 05:44.760
We're staying down!

05:44.760 --> 05:46.948
- All right, I'm not fooling around here!

05:46.948 --> 05:49.482
I told you to keep your
faces against the floor!

05:49.482 --> 05:50.315
- Okay, okay.

05:50.315 --> 05:52.121
We don't want anybody to get hurt, okay?

05:52.121 --> 05:54.337
- Now, if you want this
young lady to live,

05:54.337 --> 05:57.084
nobody moves until we're a memory.

05:57.084 --> 05:58.157
Did you drive?

05:58.157 --> 05:58.990
- Yes.

05:58.990 --> 05:59.823
- All right, get out your keys.

05:59.823 --> 06:01.003
We're going for a joyride.

06:01.003 --> 06:01.836
Do it!

06:01.836 --> 06:03.558
(bell dinging)

06:03.558 --> 06:04.488
(gun firing)

06:04.488 --> 06:05.641
(Natalie screaming)

06:05.641 --> 06:08.058
Open the door, open the door.

06:09.895 --> 06:11.199
(car alarm blaring)

06:11.199 --> 06:13.115
Kill it, kill it!

06:13.115 --> 06:13.948
(car chirping)

06:13.948 --> 06:14.960
Keys.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.296
Get in, move, over, over.

06:16.296 --> 06:17.713
All the way over.

06:23.131 --> 06:25.169
(tires screeching)

06:25.169 --> 06:27.206
(static hissing)

06:27.206 --> 06:29.050
(tone beeping)

06:29.050 --> 06:30.205
- [Dobbs] We've been patrolling--

06:30.205 --> 06:31.038
- [Man] Wait, not yet.

06:31.038 --> 06:31.871
Sorry.

06:31.871 --> 06:32.934
Okay, we're rolling.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.547
And action.

06:34.547 --> 06:36.142
- [Dobbs] We've been
patrolling these Newport Beach

06:36.142 --> 06:38.325
streets together for, what, six years?

06:38.325 --> 06:39.445
- Six and a half.

06:39.445 --> 06:40.469
- [Dobbs] Six and a half.

06:40.469 --> 06:42.346
You know, when people think Newport Beach

06:42.346 --> 06:43.845
they don't think crime.

06:43.845 --> 06:46.700
They think palm trees, the beach.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.746
But let me tell ya, we get as much crime

06:48.746 --> 06:50.485
here as in any other city.

06:50.485 --> 06:52.480
- You know, proportionate-wise.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.524
- Proportionate-wise, obviously.

06:54.524 --> 06:56.962
New York's got, what, 10 million people.

06:56.962 --> 06:58.040
- 12 million.

06:58.040 --> 06:58.873
- 12 million people.

06:58.873 --> 07:00.427
So obviously there's
more crime in New York

07:00.427 --> 07:02.406
than in Newport Beach.

07:02.406 --> 07:03.707
Proportionately.

07:03.707 --> 07:04.704
- What do you get here?

07:04.704 --> 07:07.787
Mostly domestic violence
crimes and theft, right?

07:07.787 --> 07:09.155
- Yeah, we get all that stuff.

07:09.155 --> 07:09.988
- I see.

07:09.988 --> 07:14.590
- But we get murder, we get
prostitution, we get drugs.

07:14.590 --> 07:15.992
We get all that stuff.

07:15.992 --> 07:20.890
- Well, uh, what's the worst
thing you've ever seen?

07:20.890 --> 07:22.492
- Would it be that busload of seniors

07:22.492 --> 07:23.809
that went off the cliff?

07:23.809 --> 07:25.192
- No, the kids.

07:25.192 --> 07:26.350
- Oh, god, yeah.

07:26.350 --> 07:27.477
The kids.

07:27.477 --> 07:28.361
We were on a--

07:28.361 --> 07:30.431
- [Woman Over Radio] All units

07:35.332 --> 07:37.610
Male Caucasian, armed and very dangerous,

07:37.610 --> 07:39.151
holding female hostage.

07:39.151 --> 07:41.471
Vehicle headed south
on Ocean near Magnolia.

07:41.471 --> 07:43.492
Suspect has fired on two officers.

07:43.492 --> 07:45.330
Proceed with caution.

07:45.330 --> 07:46.727
- That's us.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.865
This might be your lucky day.

07:48.865 --> 07:52.130
Three-niner at the corner
of Magnolia and View Crest.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.405
In pursuit.

07:53.405 --> 07:54.546
(siren wailing)

07:54.546 --> 07:56.145
- Let's go get us a bad guy.

07:56.145 --> 07:59.062
(heavy rock music)

08:01.540 --> 08:02.702
- I'm burning up in here.

08:02.702 --> 08:03.535
Grab the wheel.

08:03.535 --> 08:05.952
(whimpering)

08:08.524 --> 08:12.226
Look, I'm gonna let you
go as soon as it's safe.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.696
Just stop making that noise.

08:13.696 --> 08:14.702
(whimpering)

08:14.702 --> 08:16.202
- I can't help it.

08:17.654 --> 08:18.923
Just let me go.

08:18.923 --> 08:20.179
You can have the car.

08:20.179 --> 08:22.164
- Oh, I can have the car?

08:22.164 --> 08:24.795
That's very generous of you.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.581
Let me think here for a minute.

08:26.581 --> 08:27.919
- Please, just let me go.

08:27.919 --> 08:29.540
- I said I would!

08:29.540 --> 08:30.741
Jesus!

08:30.741 --> 08:31.873
Just let me think.

08:31.873 --> 08:33.539
- [Natalie] Oh, god.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.517
- Listen, you're gonna have

08:36.517 --> 08:40.236
to be my little insurance
policy right now.

08:40.236 --> 08:42.936
If you just hang tough
for a few more minutes,

08:42.936 --> 08:44.632
you're gonna be all right.

08:44.632 --> 08:45.896
Okay?

08:45.896 --> 08:46.979
- Okay, okay.

08:48.056 --> 08:50.613
- I know what you're thinking.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.034
What rotten timing, huh?

08:53.034 --> 08:55.437
If you hadn't gone in for that magazine.

08:55.437 --> 08:58.296
I feel exactly the same way.

08:58.296 --> 09:01.837
If I hadn't gone in for
those lousy cigarettes,

09:01.837 --> 09:03.115
this damn habit.

09:03.115 --> 09:04.865
I gotta quit someday.

09:08.494 --> 09:10.491
Very nice set of wheels you got here.

09:10.491 --> 09:11.324
Very nice.

09:11.324 --> 09:13.433
What, you got a phone,

09:13.433 --> 09:14.697
all real leather.

09:14.697 --> 09:17.068
How's a girl like you able
to afford a car like this?

09:17.068 --> 09:18.208
- My father gave it to me,

09:18.208 --> 09:19.850
and it's yours if you just let me go.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.626
- Your father gave it to you.

09:21.626 --> 09:22.877
Just like that?

09:22.877 --> 09:24.765
Just said, here, take
the car, you can have it.

09:24.765 --> 09:25.598
(skin sizzling)

09:25.598 --> 09:27.145
(screaming)

09:27.145 --> 09:28.062
Goddamn it!

09:31.131 --> 09:32.383
- There they are!

09:32.383 --> 09:33.216
Hang on!

09:33.216 --> 09:34.049
(siren wailing)

09:34.049 --> 09:34.882
(skin sizzling)

09:34.882 --> 09:35.715
(screaming)

09:35.715 --> 09:36.548
- Shit!

09:36.548 --> 09:37.697
- In pursuit of hijacked red BMW,

09:37.697 --> 09:41.097
southbound on Ocean, just past Horndale.

09:41.097 --> 09:43.347
Request backup immediately.

09:45.433 --> 09:48.412
(screaming)

09:48.412 --> 09:50.953
(Natalie screaming)

09:50.953 --> 09:52.313
- That was stupid!

09:52.313 --> 09:53.372
That was really stupid!

09:53.372 --> 09:54.668
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

09:54.668 --> 09:56.492
I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it!

09:56.492 --> 09:57.389
- You wanna get shot?

09:57.389 --> 09:58.663
(screaming)

09:58.663 --> 10:00.733
Rule number one, you don't
burn the guy with the gun.

10:00.733 --> 10:01.691
All right?

10:01.691 --> 10:02.871
- Oh, god, don't kill me!

10:02.871 --> 10:04.501
My father I'll give you anything you want!

10:04.501 --> 10:05.334
- [Jack] Oh, shit!

10:05.334 --> 10:06.667
Aah!

10:06.667 --> 10:09.909
(car horn honking)

10:09.909 --> 10:10.906
Ow, grab it!

10:10.906 --> 10:12.260
Get the lighter!

10:12.260 --> 10:14.927
(siren wailing)

10:16.486 --> 10:17.319
Ow, shit!

10:19.930 --> 10:21.807
Get this lighter.

10:21.807 --> 10:22.958
No!

10:22.958 --> 10:23.889
What are you doing?

10:23.889 --> 10:24.722
- What?

10:24.722 --> 10:25.660
What?

10:25.660 --> 10:27.417
What, you told me to do that!

10:27.417 --> 10:29.165
- No, I told you to
keep it from burning me,

10:29.165 --> 10:31.202
not throw it out the window!

10:31.202 --> 10:33.258
Now how the hell am I supposed to smoke?

10:33.258 --> 10:34.511
- I don't know!

10:34.511 --> 10:37.178
(siren wailing)

10:40.504 --> 10:43.254
- Oh, this is just what I needed.

10:44.977 --> 10:45.810
Shit!

10:45.810 --> 10:46.643
(screaming)

10:46.643 --> 10:49.621
(car horn honking)

10:49.621 --> 10:50.454
- Oh, god!

10:56.273 --> 10:59.273
(car horns honking)

11:02.638 --> 11:05.305
(siren wailing)

11:13.851 --> 11:15.291
- Move, move, move!

11:15.291 --> 11:16.315
- [Man] Hey!

11:16.315 --> 11:18.576
- Look out, look out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:18.576 --> 11:21.493
(car horn honking)

11:23.456 --> 11:25.717
- Would you watch?

11:25.717 --> 11:27.032
- [Man] Hey!

11:27.032 --> 11:29.137
(screaming)

11:29.137 --> 11:31.485
(siren wailing)

11:31.485 --> 11:34.240
(car horn honking)

11:34.240 --> 11:35.495
(car crashing)

11:35.495 --> 11:37.417
- We don't wanna get any
innocent commuters hurt here.

11:37.417 --> 11:39.593
We got ourselves a very sticky situation.

11:39.593 --> 11:41.735
This girl's relying on
us to rescue her safely.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.257
If I let this guy out of my sights,

11:43.257 --> 11:45.033
there's a very good
possibility that we will

11:45.033 --> 11:47.135
never see her alive again.

11:47.135 --> 11:49.802
(siren wailing)

11:54.233 --> 11:55.737
- If we can get him to a place where

11:55.737 --> 11:57.542
there's a minimum of traffic,

11:57.542 --> 11:58.975
on a back road or something,

11:58.975 --> 12:01.193
we can attempt to shoot out the tires.

12:01.193 --> 12:04.553
But the abundance of cars here
makes that highly dangerous.

12:04.553 --> 12:06.102
- Obviously, you always want to keep

12:06.102 --> 12:08.895
vehicular intercourse down
to a minimum at all times.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.252
We don't want this guy spinning out and

12:10.252 --> 12:12.551
hitting a busload of nuns or anything.

12:12.551 --> 12:15.218
(siren wailing)

12:33.948 --> 12:37.413
(truck horn honking)

12:37.413 --> 12:39.253
- Bet you don't get this every day, huh?

12:39.253 --> 12:43.691
- Listen, what's the thing you
like best about being cops?

12:43.691 --> 12:46.091
- For me, it's the respect and power

12:46.091 --> 12:48.752
that the position commands.

12:48.752 --> 12:51.502
I feel like a combination
of Bruce Springsteen

12:51.502 --> 12:53.054
and Sylvester Stallone out there.

12:53.054 --> 12:55.068
I don't know whether I ought a be busting'

12:55.068 --> 12:57.130
bad guys or signing autographs.

12:57.130 --> 12:59.130
Kinda like being a star.

13:03.743 --> 13:07.228
(tires screeching)

13:07.228 --> 13:08.487
- I'm gonna throw up.

13:08.487 --> 13:09.628
- What do you mean?

13:09.628 --> 13:10.780
- I feel sick.

13:10.780 --> 13:11.985
- No, don't you dare.

13:11.985 --> 13:13.300
Don't you dare throw up.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.133
Breathe.

13:14.133 --> 13:14.966
Take in some air.

13:14.966 --> 13:17.149
Put your head out the window.

13:17.149 --> 13:19.104
- Well, don't drive so fast.

13:19.104 --> 13:20.352
- Don't drive so fast?

13:20.352 --> 13:21.368
What are you, mad?

13:21.368 --> 13:22.728
I'm being chased by the cops!

13:22.728 --> 13:24.720
When you're being chased
by cops, you drive fast.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.678
Got it?

13:25.678 --> 13:27.623
- Well, I get carsick!

13:27.623 --> 13:30.103
- Well, then, put your head
out the goddamn window!

13:30.103 --> 13:32.186
What are you waiting for?

13:33.141 --> 13:33.974
- Look at that.

13:33.974 --> 13:34.807
She's got her head out the window!

13:34.807 --> 13:35.640
What's she doing?

13:35.640 --> 13:36.513
- Maybe she's trying to signal us.

13:36.513 --> 13:37.346
- Can you tell what she's saying?

13:37.346 --> 13:40.335
- No, no, I can't make
her face out clearly.

13:40.335 --> 13:41.168
- Oh!

13:43.314 --> 13:46.276
(gagging)

13:46.276 --> 13:47.109
(vomiting)

13:47.109 --> 13:49.325
- Oh, she's puking!

13:49.325 --> 13:50.158
- Aah!

13:50.158 --> 13:51.445
- Gross!
- Oh, god!

13:51.445 --> 13:52.985
- [Jack] She's puking!

13:52.985 --> 13:56.329
- That will never make prime time.

13:56.329 --> 13:59.006
- That is a lot of puke.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.507
- [Dobbs] I can't see a damn thing.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.523
(truck horn honking)

14:02.523 --> 14:05.507
(all screaming)

14:05.507 --> 14:06.616
(coughing)

14:06.616 --> 14:07.869
- [Natalie] Oh, god.

14:07.869 --> 14:09.665
- Guess she wasn't signaling us.

14:09.665 --> 14:10.582
- You okay?

14:11.587 --> 14:13.020
- No.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.022
- Do me a favor, will ya.

14:14.022 --> 14:15.301
Chew some gum or something.

14:15.301 --> 14:17.799
Your breath smells like
my grandmother's feet.

14:17.799 --> 14:18.769
(car horn honking)

14:18.769 --> 14:19.861
- [Figus] Where the hell
are the other backups?

14:19.861 --> 14:22.161
We only got one other car here with us.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.196
- [Woman Over Radio] Unit
39, most units unavailable

14:24.196 --> 14:27.502
due to the funeral of Captain
Lembeck in Long Beach.

14:27.502 --> 14:30.262
All remaining available
units should be en route.

14:30.262 --> 14:32.363
- Jesus Chris, if Lembeck
knew that his funeral

14:32.363 --> 14:34.801
was impeding a pursuit with hostages,

14:34.801 --> 14:36.200
he'd go nuts.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.662
Get those other cops
off their cans, will ya?

14:38.662 --> 14:40.397
We're naked out here.

14:40.397 --> 14:43.062
- All available units, please
respond in the vicinity

14:43.062 --> 14:45.686
of San Remos and Point Vale.

14:45.686 --> 14:48.203
High-speed pursuit in progress.

14:48.203 --> 14:51.218
Red BMW, license plate number

14:51.218 --> 14:53.218
four-nickel-Adam-Thomas.

14:57.403 --> 14:58.863
- I do not run my division

14:58.863 --> 15:01.601
on a shoot first, ask
questions later philosophy!

15:01.601 --> 15:02.716
- Excuse me, sir.

15:02.716 --> 15:03.903
- Can't you see I'm busy?

15:03.903 --> 15:05.295
- I think you're gonna wanna know

15:05.295 --> 15:06.878
about this right away, sir.

15:06.878 --> 15:09.550
We just got a positive ID on that red BMW.

15:09.550 --> 15:11.083
Hold on to your beans, sir.

15:11.083 --> 15:14.283
It's registered to a Miss
Natalie Nordhoff Voss.

15:14.283 --> 15:15.841
She's the young lady hostage, sir.

15:15.841 --> 15:17.963
- So who's Natalie Nordhoff Voss?

15:17.963 --> 15:20.807
- Voss, sir, like in Dalton Voss.

15:20.807 --> 15:23.083
- No, not the Dalton Voss.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.837
Are you saying that our
hostage belongs to Dalton Voss?

15:25.837 --> 15:26.670
- Yes, sir.

15:26.670 --> 15:28.462
His one and only daughter.

15:28.462 --> 15:29.351
- Holy shit!

15:29.351 --> 15:30.230
- [Cop] Yes, sir.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.063
- How many cars in pursuit?

15:31.063 --> 15:31.896
- Well, two, sir.

15:31.896 --> 15:32.729
- Two?

15:32.729 --> 15:33.562
There ought a be 20!

15:33.562 --> 15:34.395
Why are there only two?

15:34.395 --> 15:35.228
- Uh, the funeral, sir.

15:35.228 --> 15:36.679
A third car is on its way.

15:36.679 --> 15:38.052
- Three stinking little cars.

15:38.052 --> 15:38.885
Where's our chopper?

15:38.885 --> 15:40.899
- [Cop] We loaned it to
that film company, sir.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.361
- Well, why the hell did we do that?

15:42.361 --> 15:43.699
- You approved it, sir.

15:43.699 --> 15:46.259
We haven't needed to use the
chopper for quite some time,

15:46.259 --> 15:48.113
since that Marin County brush fire, sir.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.513
- This is a fine how-do-you-do.

15:49.513 --> 15:50.744
Get that chopper back now!

15:50.744 --> 15:52.303
- [Cop] Yes, sir.

15:52.303 --> 15:55.640
(siren wailing)

15:55.640 --> 15:56.919
- Now, who's Natalie Voss?

15:56.919 --> 15:58.821
- Only Dalton Voss's daughter.

15:58.821 --> 16:01.234
- Dalton Voss is the
Donald Trump of California.

16:01.234 --> 16:03.041
- He's one of the richest men in America.

16:03.041 --> 16:05.203
You guys really struck gold tonight, huh?

16:05.203 --> 16:08.120
(heavy rock music)

16:27.130 --> 16:28.879
(tires screeching)

16:28.879 --> 16:30.282
- Well, I gotta do what I gotta do.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.494
Get down to Mexico much?

16:31.494 --> 16:32.411
- No, why?

16:32.411 --> 16:33.297
- 'Cause that's where we're headed.

16:33.297 --> 16:34.911
I wasn't planning on company, but--

16:34.911 --> 16:36.035
- Oh, my god!

16:36.035 --> 16:36.868
Mexico?

16:36.868 --> 16:39.317
Oh, god, just stop the car and let me go!

16:39.317 --> 16:40.541
Just let me out!

16:40.541 --> 16:43.130
- You are really starting
to get on my nerves.

16:43.130 --> 16:44.261
I'm in a bit of a bind here,

16:44.261 --> 16:45.264
so put on your seat belt.

16:45.264 --> 16:46.589
We're getting on the freeway.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.256
(siren wailing)

17:05.659 --> 17:10.659
(car horn honking)
(tires screeching)

17:15.215 --> 17:16.209
- Shit!

17:16.209 --> 17:17.041
This is bad!

17:17.041 --> 17:18.210
This is really bad!

17:18.210 --> 17:20.079
Oh, I can't say the S word on TV, can I?

17:20.079 --> 17:21.038
- [Man] It's cool, we'll bleep it.

17:21.038 --> 17:21.954
- All right, yeah.

17:21.954 --> 17:24.037
- Why is this so bad?

17:24.037 --> 17:27.022
- Taking the chase on the
freeway heightens the stakes.

17:27.022 --> 17:29.103
It complicates things greatly for us.

17:29.103 --> 17:32.020
- This guy's really pissing me off!

17:34.740 --> 17:37.981
(car horn honking)

17:37.981 --> 17:38.814
- Shit.

17:59.949 --> 18:03.757
- And if you're traveling
along the five into LA,

18:03.757 --> 18:05.549
there's a slight bottleneck

18:05.549 --> 18:08.266
along the John Wayne northbound.

18:08.266 --> 18:10.301
Yeah, it seems an overturned gravel truck

18:10.301 --> 18:13.165
on the shoulder is causing some slowing.

18:13.165 --> 18:15.641
Other than that, it's a
pretty good commute into the,

18:15.641 --> 18:17.280
whoa, wait a second!

18:17.280 --> 18:18.704
Wait a second!

18:18.704 --> 18:20.258
I think we got a situation developing

18:20.258 --> 18:22.227
on the southbound lane.

18:22.227 --> 18:25.306
Yes, it appears we're picking
up a high-speed pursuit.

18:25.306 --> 18:27.459
Bill and Wendy, do you
see this in the studio?

18:27.459 --> 18:29.450
- Yes, Byron, we surely do.

18:29.450 --> 18:30.720
It does appear as though we're watching

18:30.720 --> 18:33.049
a high-speed chase unfold live.

18:33.049 --> 18:35.146
- Bill, I'm gonna follow
this late-breaking story,

18:35.146 --> 18:37.468
see if we can get a little bit closer.

18:37.468 --> 18:39.569
Uh, Andy, uh, take it down a little bit

18:39.569 --> 18:43.788
and see if you can stay with the red car.

18:43.788 --> 18:45.353
Three Newport Beach police cars

18:45.353 --> 18:47.009
are taking every precaution

18:47.009 --> 18:50.268
so as not to cause any
kind of traffic accident.

18:50.268 --> 18:51.722
They seem to be following at a safe

18:51.722 --> 18:56.484
distance behind what appears
to be a late-model BMW.

18:56.484 --> 18:57.732
Oh, yeah.

18:57.732 --> 18:58.978
They're after this guy, all right.

18:58.978 --> 18:59.811
(chuckling)

18:59.811 --> 19:00.909
He must've done something.

19:00.909 --> 19:02.191
(heavy rock music)

19:02.191 --> 19:05.362
(tires screeching)

19:05.362 --> 19:06.706
(screaming)

19:06.706 --> 19:07.539
Whoa!

19:07.539 --> 19:09.289
Ho, did you see that?

19:15.247 --> 19:16.285
- [Figus] Oh, watch out.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.118
Watch out.

19:19.286 --> 19:20.966
- Holy mackerel!

19:20.966 --> 19:22.432
That medical school truck is spilling

19:22.432 --> 19:25.604
out cadavers all along the freeway!

19:25.604 --> 19:26.994
That's repugnant!

19:26.994 --> 19:27.827
- Gross!

19:29.831 --> 19:32.664
(bodies thudding)

19:41.132 --> 19:43.034
(screaming)

19:43.034 --> 19:45.514
- [Dobbs] Get it off!

19:45.514 --> 19:46.347
- Jeez!

19:49.013 --> 19:50.096
- Get it off!

19:52.133 --> 19:52.966
- Eeeww!

19:53.813 --> 19:55.352
- Now, that's disgusting.

19:55.352 --> 19:56.648
- [Bill] I'll say.

19:56.648 --> 19:58.133
Stay with him, Byron.

19:58.133 --> 19:59.674
- We're going to try to
get some more information

19:59.674 --> 20:01.307
from the Newport Beach Police Department

20:01.307 --> 20:03.673
on this fast-breaking,
exclusive Channel Eight,

20:03.673 --> 20:06.090
high-speed chase in progress.

20:07.482 --> 20:08.315
- Oh, no!

20:08.315 --> 20:09.850
God, oh, my god!

20:09.850 --> 20:11.203
- Jesus!

20:11.203 --> 20:13.189
What are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

20:13.189 --> 20:15.633
Rule number one is no loud screaming.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.531
- I thought rule number one was no burning

20:17.531 --> 20:18.969
the guy with the gun.

20:18.969 --> 20:21.868
- You might just be a little
too feisty for your own good.

20:21.868 --> 20:25.064
Christ, okay, rule number
two is no loud screaming.

20:25.064 --> 20:26.992
- Will you stop waving
that thing in my face.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.072
- Am I holding the gun in your face?

20:29.072 --> 20:30.700
I don't think so.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.042
You know, I can be a pretty likable guy

20:32.042 --> 20:33.573
when I'm not pointing a gun at somebody.

20:33.573 --> 20:35.396
I know you don't believe
me, but it's true.

20:35.396 --> 20:37.300
You gotta trust me.

20:37.300 --> 20:41.163
(helicopter whirring)

20:41.163 --> 20:41.996
Aw, shit!

20:42.955 --> 20:45.156
Why do things always go so wrong for me?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.641
- Maybe you bring it on yourself.

20:46.641 --> 20:47.895
- Maybe you don't know
what you're talking about!

20:47.895 --> 20:48.728
- Maybe I do.

20:48.728 --> 20:49.565
- Maybe you're a brat.

20:49.565 --> 20:50.859
- Maybe I am.

20:50.859 --> 20:52.741
Would you please just stop and let me out.

20:52.741 --> 20:54.459
I promise I won't let them shoot you.

20:54.459 --> 20:55.499
- Oh, you won't them shoot me.

20:55.499 --> 20:58.195
That's very nice and I appreciate
that, but I can't do that.

20:58.195 --> 20:59.756
Not yet.

20:59.756 --> 21:01.377
So, seeing that we're gonna
be traveling companions

21:01.377 --> 21:04.191
for a while, I thought we
should get better acquainted.

21:04.191 --> 21:05.319
My name is Jack.

21:05.319 --> 21:06.152
And you are?

21:06.152 --> 21:06.985
- You can't do this.

21:06.985 --> 21:08.490
- Do what?

21:08.490 --> 21:09.493
- This!

21:09.493 --> 21:11.728
You, you can't just kidnap somebody

21:11.728 --> 21:14.350
and threaten to kill
them and then expect them

21:14.350 --> 21:15.848
to be cute and nice.

21:15.848 --> 21:16.770
- Why not?

21:16.770 --> 21:18.353
- You just can't, okay?

21:18.353 --> 21:19.814
It doesn't work that way.

21:19.814 --> 21:21.217
You are a terrorist.

21:21.217 --> 21:22.567
Why should I be nice back to you?

21:22.567 --> 21:23.958
- Hey, hey, all right, first of all,

21:23.958 --> 21:25.832
I am not a terrorist, all right?

21:25.832 --> 21:29.272
Terrorists have ratty
beards and blow up airports.

21:29.272 --> 21:30.853
And secondly, there are no rules

21:30.853 --> 21:32.275
on how to kidnap people.

21:32.275 --> 21:34.294
There's no rule that says you
can't be cordial and nice.

21:34.294 --> 21:35.937
And quite frankly, for my first time out,

21:35.937 --> 21:37.773
I think I'm doing a hell of a job.

21:37.773 --> 21:39.275
Now tell me your name!

21:39.275 --> 21:41.494
- Only if you get rid of the gun.

21:41.494 --> 21:42.372
It scares me.

21:42.372 --> 21:43.205
- Oh, right.

21:43.205 --> 21:44.530
I'll do that, you'll do something stupid,

21:44.530 --> 21:45.420
I'll crash the car.

21:45.420 --> 21:46.253
I don't think so.

21:46.253 --> 21:47.769
- I'm not gonna do anything stupid, okay?

21:47.769 --> 21:49.686
I just, I, I hate guns.

21:54.419 --> 21:55.252
- There?

21:55.252 --> 21:56.085
Are you satisfied?

21:56.085 --> 21:57.828
I'm only doing that to ease your mind.

21:57.828 --> 21:58.948
- Thank you.

21:58.948 --> 22:01.253
Now, as I said before, my name is Jack.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.219
And you are?

22:02.219 --> 22:03.225
- Natalie.

22:03.225 --> 22:04.308
Natalie Voss.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.225
- Natalie Voss.

22:07.225 --> 22:08.825
(chuckling)

22:08.825 --> 22:09.923
That's nice.

22:09.923 --> 22:12.639
What, are you related to
Dalton Voss or something?

22:12.639 --> 22:13.587
- He's my father.

22:13.587 --> 22:15.504
- Yeah, right, get out.

22:19.257 --> 22:21.801
It was a joke, I was joking.

22:21.801 --> 22:22.718
- I wasn't.

22:23.678 --> 22:24.980
- This is insane.

22:24.980 --> 22:26.398
You're Dalton Voss's daughter?

22:26.398 --> 22:27.731
The Dalton Voss?

22:28.732 --> 22:31.559
Do you have any idea how
goddamn rich that man is?

22:31.559 --> 22:33.038
- Yes, thank you very much.

22:33.038 --> 22:36.377
He is my father, as if you didn't know.

22:36.377 --> 22:38.158
(chuckling)

22:38.158 --> 22:39.873
- As if I didn't know.

22:39.873 --> 22:41.060
- [Natalie] What?

22:41.060 --> 22:43.512
- I just, this just, this just sucks!

22:43.512 --> 22:44.345
It sucks!

22:44.345 --> 22:45.867
Because now they're
gonna think I kidnapped

22:45.867 --> 22:49.043
you because you're Dalton Voss's daughter.

22:49.043 --> 22:50.671
Why me, why me?

22:50.671 --> 22:52.891
I go in for some cigarettes
and a tank of gas,

22:52.891 --> 22:55.785
and I wind up kidnapping
the daughter of Dalton Voss.

22:55.785 --> 22:57.472
What are the odds?

22:57.472 --> 22:58.550
- I would say pretty good.

22:58.550 --> 22:59.559
You were probably stalking me.

22:59.559 --> 23:00.882
- Don't flatter yourself, kid.

23:00.882 --> 23:02.925
I was just passing through town.

23:02.925 --> 23:04.525
- A likely story.

23:04.525 --> 23:06.525
- Jesus, you are a brat.

23:08.030 --> 23:10.642
- This just in from the
Newport Beach Police.

23:10.642 --> 23:12.845
The owner of the BMW has been identified

23:12.845 --> 23:14.562
as miss Natalie Voss,

23:14.562 --> 23:17.240
daughter of millionaire
industrialist Dalton Voss.

23:17.240 --> 23:18.855
Police speculate the gunman

23:18.855 --> 23:20.584
followed miss Voss with the intent

23:20.584 --> 23:23.109
of kidnapping her for ransom.

23:23.109 --> 23:24.648
- Well, it certainly is obvious, Wendy,

23:24.648 --> 23:27.429
that this kidnapping was no happenstance.

23:27.429 --> 23:28.860
As you can see, police are taking

23:28.860 --> 23:31.354
a more aggressive position,
tailing very close

23:31.354 --> 23:32.568
behind the BMW.

23:32.568 --> 23:34.080
(door buzzing)

23:34.080 --> 23:34.958
- Shit.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.875
(percussive music)

23:39.830 --> 23:42.114
(muttering)

23:42.114 --> 23:43.693
Mr. Voss, Mrs. Voss.

23:43.693 --> 23:45.533
I want you to know, as
far as we can ascertain,

23:45.533 --> 23:47.094
your daughter is perfectly safe.

23:47.094 --> 23:48.535
- "Perfectly safe"?

23:48.535 --> 23:49.832
She's being held hostage in the

23:49.832 --> 23:51.328
middle of a goddamn high-speed chase!

23:51.328 --> 23:53.394
How can you say she's perfectly safe?

23:53.394 --> 23:54.573
If she were perfectly safe,

23:54.573 --> 23:56.712
she'd be at home, locked
up, where she belongs!

23:56.712 --> 23:58.139
- Unharmed, sir, is what I meant.

23:58.139 --> 23:59.332
Uh, perfectly unharmed.

23:59.332 --> 24:01.398
Our officers are in diligent pursuit.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.927
- Oh, poor little Nattie
in her brand-new car.

24:03.927 --> 24:04.911
- You look here, Boyle.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.253
You stop trying to give me this bullshit!

24:07.253 --> 24:08.389
It was your incompetent officers

24:08.389 --> 24:10.170
that allowed all this to
happen in the first place!

24:10.170 --> 24:12.147
I want my daughter out
of this jeopardy now!

24:12.147 --> 24:13.392
- I can assure you, Mr. Voss,

24:13.392 --> 24:14.859
my main concern is your daughter's safety.

24:14.859 --> 24:15.852
CHP has been notified

24:15.852 --> 24:17.692
and will be providing assistance from--

24:17.692 --> 24:19.816
- Just do your goddamn job
the right way for a change.

24:19.816 --> 24:20.649
All right?

24:20.649 --> 24:21.918
- Okay, okay, be cool, Jack, be cool.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.091
Don't panic, don't panic.

24:23.091 --> 24:24.679
Think, think, think, think.

24:24.679 --> 24:25.561
Breathe.

24:25.561 --> 24:27.618
Things are way out of control!

24:27.618 --> 24:29.824
You did not actually kidnap anyone.

24:29.824 --> 24:32.164
- Oh, well, in case you've
forgotten, you kidnapped me!

24:32.164 --> 24:34.486
- I mean, I didn't
intend to kidnap anyone.

24:34.486 --> 24:36.457
- Well, pardon me, but
is there a difference?

24:36.457 --> 24:38.968
- Well, of course there's
a difference, you moron!

24:38.968 --> 24:40.980
Intent means you planned something.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.902
I didn't plan anything!

24:42.902 --> 24:45.062
- Oh, so somebody held a gun to your head

24:45.062 --> 24:48.001
and made you hold a gun to my head!

24:48.001 --> 24:49.334
- In a way, yes.

24:54.189 --> 24:57.067
- God, it's filthy in here.

24:57.067 --> 24:58.567
What's that stink?

25:05.721 --> 25:08.442
- [Man] Step right over here, please.

25:08.442 --> 25:10.306
- [Boyle] Give it to me quick, Patterson.

25:10.306 --> 25:12.466
- We got a beautiful shot, full on.

25:12.466 --> 25:13.299
Right now.

25:14.828 --> 25:16.430
(computer beeping)

25:16.430 --> 25:18.686
Let's see if I can get closer.

25:18.686 --> 25:21.125
(computer beeping)

25:21.125 --> 25:22.686
- Look at his eyes.

25:22.686 --> 25:23.519
Chilling.

25:23.519 --> 25:24.352
- Yeah.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.811
So, who in the hell is he?

25:27.811 --> 25:30.728
(printer whirring)

25:32.543 --> 25:35.707
- "Name, Hammond, Jackson Davis, age 28.

25:35.707 --> 25:37.645
"Escaped guards while
being transferred from

25:37.645 --> 25:39.986
"San Francisco County Jail to San Quentin

25:39.986 --> 25:43.205
"after being sentenced for
a 1991 armed bank robbery."

25:43.205 --> 25:44.038
- Hammond?

25:44.038 --> 25:45.371
Let me see that.

25:46.808 --> 25:48.926
We were notified yesterday he
might be headed for Mexico.

25:48.926 --> 25:52.227
- You were notified yesterday
and you did nothing?

25:52.227 --> 25:54.168
What the hell kind of place is this?

25:54.168 --> 25:55.886
- Mr. Voss, I stress, we were alerted

25:55.886 --> 25:58.366
he, he might be headed this way.

25:58.366 --> 26:01.246
He could have been headed for
Vegas or Utah just as easily.

26:01.246 --> 26:03.243
Keep in mind, we're
cops, not mind readers.

26:03.243 --> 26:04.627
- Maybe you're not, but I am.

26:04.627 --> 26:05.633
And I can see quite clearly you're gonna

26:05.633 --> 26:07.524
be looking for a new goddamn job

26:07.524 --> 26:10.324
if one hair on my
daughter's head is harmed!

26:10.324 --> 26:11.667
Do you hear me?

26:11.667 --> 26:12.595
One hair!

26:12.595 --> 26:13.887
- [Boyle] Get this out in the field.

26:13.887 --> 26:15.703
- Take his freaking
picture off that monitor!

26:15.703 --> 26:16.688
I don't wanna see it!

26:16.688 --> 26:20.030
- Attention, all units
in pursuit of red BMW.

26:20.030 --> 26:25.030
Kidnapper identified as
Jackson Davis Hammond, age 28.

26:25.201 --> 26:29.906
Escaped prisoner convicted
of armed bank robbery.

26:29.906 --> 26:30.927
- Shit!

26:30.927 --> 26:32.261
Goddamn bastard!

26:32.261 --> 26:33.388
He's desperate.

26:33.388 --> 26:34.690
This is really bad.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.283
Things could get really messy now.

26:36.283 --> 26:37.130
- Oh, an escaped con!

26:37.130 --> 26:38.586
This is great!

26:38.586 --> 26:42.203
Real-life human drama at
its nitty-gritty best.

26:42.203 --> 26:43.826
- We've been keeping a lookout,

26:43.826 --> 26:45.341
but you never know where a creep like this

26:45.341 --> 26:46.965
is gonna pop up next.

26:46.965 --> 26:51.965
(siren wailing)
(heavy rock music)

26:53.401 --> 26:56.128
- We're going in close
on the driver's side!

26:56.128 --> 26:57.961
This guy's a lunatic!

26:57.961 --> 27:02.628
- We'll flank him on the
passenger side, squeeze him in.

27:07.422 --> 27:08.436
- [Jack] Shit!

27:08.436 --> 27:09.269
- What?

27:09.269 --> 27:10.102
What?

27:10.102 --> 27:12.856
- This has just gotten way too hairy.

27:12.856 --> 27:14.284
- What do you mean, "hairy"?

27:14.284 --> 27:15.839
- [Jack] I mean hairy!

27:15.839 --> 27:17.290
- [Cop] This is too good.

27:17.290 --> 27:19.744
(Natalie screaming)

27:19.744 --> 27:20.747
(gun firing)

27:20.747 --> 27:21.748
(tires screeching)

27:21.748 --> 27:23.715
- [Figus] Whoa.

27:23.715 --> 27:27.075
(car crashing)

27:27.075 --> 27:27.947
- [Man] Holy Christ!

27:27.947 --> 27:29.530
Get that, get that!

27:32.454 --> 27:33.929
(truck crashing)

27:33.929 --> 27:35.567
- Oh, my god!

27:35.567 --> 27:36.946
Did you see that?

27:36.946 --> 27:38.525
Those vehicles tumbled across the freeway

27:38.525 --> 27:40.344
like Matchbox cars!

27:40.344 --> 27:42.340
- [Bill] This is truly dramatic footage!

27:42.340 --> 27:44.094
- Byron, was that a
gunshot we saw come out

27:44.094 --> 27:46.041
of the driver's side window?

27:46.041 --> 27:48.201
- Yes, yes, that's affirmative, Wendy!

27:48.201 --> 27:51.136
It appears the assailant
shot out the tires

27:51.136 --> 27:53.600
on the cop car, causing the catastrophe.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.399
This guy must be a sharpshooter to have

27:55.399 --> 27:58.076
such impeccable aim at such high speeds.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.279
Possibly an ex-marine.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.279
- Holy shit.

28:02.418 --> 28:04.258
Did you see him flip over?

28:04.258 --> 28:06.073
I didn't mean to do that.

28:06.073 --> 28:07.255
- Well, what do you think is gonna happen

28:07.255 --> 28:10.896
when you shoot a tire
out at 80 miles an hour?

28:10.896 --> 28:11.729
- I don't know.

28:11.729 --> 28:12.798
It just went off.

28:12.798 --> 28:14.056
I didn't mean to shoot him.

28:14.056 --> 28:16.296
- Well, what were you gonna
do, squirt water at him?

28:16.296 --> 28:18.536
- Shut up for a minute and let me think!

28:18.536 --> 28:22.078
Your voice is cutting
through my brain like nails.

28:22.078 --> 28:23.993
- What's that supposed to mean?

28:23.993 --> 28:25.694
What, I have a shrilly voice?

28:25.694 --> 28:28.028
Excuse me for not being
the perfect hostage.

28:28.028 --> 28:29.445
- I said shut up!

28:30.536 --> 28:33.896
This whole thing has
gotten way too violent.

28:33.896 --> 28:35.994
I, I hate violence.

28:35.994 --> 28:37.573
- You hate violence?

28:37.573 --> 28:39.713
You are the epitome of violence!

28:39.713 --> 28:43.151
You're a gun-wielding,
cop-shooting, maniac kidnapper.

28:43.151 --> 28:44.878
Now, that's violent.

28:44.878 --> 28:46.478
- No, I am not!

28:46.478 --> 28:47.473
Don't tell me what I am

28:47.473 --> 28:49.395
when you don't know a damn thing about me!

28:49.395 --> 28:51.053
There is a difference in being violent

28:51.053 --> 28:53.438
and being driven to violence!

28:53.438 --> 28:55.355
I am not a violent man.

28:56.798 --> 28:57.631
- God!

28:59.436 --> 29:01.014
Well, then what are you?

29:01.014 --> 29:03.334
- Look, I'll make it
simple for you, all right?

29:03.334 --> 29:05.871
I was convicted of a
crime I did not commit.

29:05.871 --> 29:06.910
The system does not believe me.

29:06.910 --> 29:09.148
Why should I expect you to?

29:09.148 --> 29:10.846
That's who I am.

29:10.846 --> 29:11.679
- You're right.

29:11.679 --> 29:12.512
I don't believe you.

29:12.512 --> 29:14.093
- Well, there you go.

29:14.093 --> 29:15.341
- What kind of a crime?

29:15.341 --> 29:16.174
(phone ringing)

29:16.174 --> 29:17.115
- What is that?

29:17.115 --> 29:18.350
What's that noise?

29:18.350 --> 29:19.790
- The phone.

29:19.790 --> 29:21.790
- Not a word out of you.

29:23.505 --> 29:24.338
What the hell?

29:24.338 --> 29:26.282
- Press the send button.

29:26.282 --> 29:27.450
(phone beeping)

29:27.450 --> 29:28.283
- Hello?

29:28.283 --> 29:29.116
- Jackson Hammond?

29:29.116 --> 29:30.920
Chief Boyle, Newport Beach.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.233
Son, why don't you pull over to the side

29:33.233 --> 29:34.891
and let the girl go.

29:34.891 --> 29:37.609
What do you say we end
this fiasco right now?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.675
I promise to help you any way I can.

29:39.675 --> 29:40.891
- Nothing doing, chief.

29:40.891 --> 29:43.595
I don't give a damn about
your hollow promises.

29:43.595 --> 29:45.915
I've listened to empty hype for two years.

29:45.915 --> 29:47.473
- For god's sake, Hammond!

29:47.473 --> 29:48.385
Aren't you in enough trouble?

29:48.385 --> 29:49.554
What's this gonna prove?

29:49.554 --> 29:50.887
There's no escape, you know that.

29:50.887 --> 29:53.911
So why don't you just let the
girl go before she gets hurt.

29:53.911 --> 29:56.455
- The girl is not gonna get
hurt if you tell your officers

29:56.455 --> 29:58.448
to get off my back.

29:58.448 --> 29:59.648
- [Boyle] You know I can't do that.

29:59.648 --> 30:00.775
- Get out of my way!

30:00.775 --> 30:01.608
Let me talk!

30:01.608 --> 30:03.932
Jackson Hammond, this is Dalton Voss.

30:03.932 --> 30:04.824
- Daddy, help me!

30:04.824 --> 30:05.657
Do something!

30:05.657 --> 30:08.050
- If you harm my daughter,
I'll kill you myself,

30:08.050 --> 30:09.348
you stinking son of a bitch!

30:09.348 --> 30:10.472
You hear me?

30:10.472 --> 30:11.305
- Tell him you're fine.

30:11.305 --> 30:12.177
Do it.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.760
- [Dalton] Natalie?

30:15.179 --> 30:16.612
- I'm fine.

30:16.612 --> 30:17.753
- There, you hear that?

30:17.753 --> 30:18.621
She's fine.

30:18.621 --> 30:20.460
Well, Dalton Voss.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.357
This is truly an honor.

30:22.357 --> 30:24.168
- Okay, Hammond, cut the crap.

30:24.168 --> 30:25.579
How much do you want?

30:25.579 --> 30:27.017
- How much what do I want?

30:27.017 --> 30:28.289
- Money, you asshole.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.838
Come on, I don't want to
pander to the likes of you.

30:29.838 --> 30:32.053
Just tell me how much
you want, and it's yours.

30:32.053 --> 30:33.694
- Well, that's very kind, Mr. Voss,

30:33.694 --> 30:36.398
but I'm really not interested
in your goddamn money.

30:36.398 --> 30:37.407
- Of course he's interested in your money.

30:37.407 --> 30:39.061
What else could he want?

30:39.061 --> 30:42.378
- Don't make me lose my patience, Hammond.

30:42.378 --> 30:43.211
$50,000.

30:44.337 --> 30:45.878
- $50,000?

30:45.878 --> 30:48.137
That's all your daughter's worth to you?

30:48.137 --> 30:49.139
You're a billionaire!

30:49.139 --> 30:51.094
That's pathetic!

30:51.094 --> 30:51.967
- All right, fine.

30:51.967 --> 30:53.217
$100,000, then?

30:54.411 --> 30:56.079
What the hell do you want?

30:56.079 --> 30:56.952
An airplane?

30:56.952 --> 30:57.785
What?

30:57.785 --> 30:58.618
- Look, I don't want your money.

30:58.618 --> 30:59.914
I don't want your planes.

30:59.914 --> 31:00.747
- [Dalton] Come on!

31:00.747 --> 31:01.857
I didn't just fall off a turnip truck.

31:01.857 --> 31:03.607
- Must've been a yam wagon.

31:03.607 --> 31:05.584
Your pop's got a good sense of humor.

31:05.584 --> 31:07.543
- Let me talk to my daughter.

31:07.543 --> 31:08.925
Nattie, honey?

31:08.925 --> 31:10.226
- I'm here.

31:10.226 --> 31:11.567
- Your father and I will
get you out of this,

31:11.567 --> 31:13.376
no matter what it costs.

31:13.376 --> 31:15.111
Understand?

31:15.111 --> 31:16.791
Be brave, darling.

31:16.791 --> 31:21.277
That man isn't trying
anything funny, is he?

31:21.277 --> 31:22.232
- No, Yvonne.

31:22.232 --> 31:24.568
He isn't trying anything funny.

31:24.568 --> 31:26.670
- Natalie, your mother and I--

31:26.670 --> 31:27.891
- Stepmother!

31:27.891 --> 31:29.046
- Natalie, don't start.

31:29.046 --> 31:31.142
- Well, she isn't my mother, is she?

31:31.142 --> 31:32.780
Can we not go through this right now?

31:32.780 --> 31:34.903
I'm being held hostage in a speeding car.

31:34.903 --> 31:35.736
Remember?

31:35.736 --> 31:37.269
- Don't smart-mouth me, young lady.

31:37.269 --> 31:39.022
You have put me in a
very touchy situation.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.669
I'm supposed to be on a plane
for Paris, for Christ's sake!

31:41.669 --> 31:43.182
- Sorry, daddy.

31:43.182 --> 31:45.860
- I swear, I don't know what's
gotten into you, Natalie.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.509
It's been one headache
after another, hasn't it?

31:47.509 --> 31:48.817
What is your problem?

31:48.817 --> 31:51.032
I've tried to give you
everything you want.

31:51.032 --> 31:52.735
- She takes you for granted, Dalton.

31:52.735 --> 31:53.568
She's spoiled.

31:53.568 --> 31:54.995
- Hey, hey, hey!

31:54.995 --> 31:57.290
What's the matter with you people?

31:57.290 --> 31:59.493
Your daughter is going
through a crisis right now

31:59.493 --> 32:01.917
and does not need to be berated like this!

32:01.917 --> 32:03.095
- You listen to me, Hammond--

32:03.095 --> 32:05.332
- No, you listen to me, Dalt!

32:05.332 --> 32:08.111
Who talks to their daughter that way?

32:08.111 --> 32:10.173
You ought a be ashamed of yourself.

32:10.173 --> 32:12.856
She's obviously fallen into
an unfortunate situation here

32:12.856 --> 32:15.757
and could use just a
little bit of compassion!

32:15.757 --> 32:17.773
You think about it, asshole.

32:17.773 --> 32:18.928
(phone beeping)

32:18.928 --> 32:20.108
(sighing)

32:20.108 --> 32:22.793
No offense, but what a dickhead.

32:22.793 --> 32:24.772
- Tell me about it.

32:24.772 --> 32:26.780
- Hammond, Hammond?

32:26.780 --> 32:28.386
Goddamn it!

32:28.386 --> 32:30.310
- As we continue our
exclusive Channel Eight

32:30.310 --> 32:33.032
coverage, looks like help is on the way.

32:33.032 --> 32:36.587
Three CHP cars and two CHP cycles

32:36.587 --> 32:39.314
have just joined the Newport Beach Police

32:39.314 --> 32:41.147
in pursuit of the BMW.

32:42.048 --> 32:44.743
So far this guy has managed to evade

32:44.743 --> 32:47.660
the police's every attempt to put an end

32:47.660 --> 32:51.088
to this heinous, runaway-train scenario.

32:51.088 --> 32:53.067
- I tell you, it never
ceases to amaze me how many

32:53.067 --> 32:55.022
people try and run from the cops.

32:55.022 --> 32:56.425
I mean, what are they thinking?

32:56.425 --> 32:57.258
Ehh!

32:57.258 --> 32:58.091
Hello?

32:58.091 --> 32:59.663
I'm gonna outrun a policeman!

32:59.663 --> 33:01.927
What's going on in
their tiny little minds?

33:01.927 --> 33:03.432
Do they really think
they're gonna get away?

33:03.432 --> 33:05.025
Like take this Hammond guy.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.655
We're gonna nail him!

33:06.655 --> 33:08.703
- [Announcer] This is a special
edition of Channel Eight

33:08.703 --> 33:10.109
News at Six.

33:10.109 --> 33:12.670
Tonight, terror on the freeway!

33:12.670 --> 33:17.670
(voice echoing)
(dramatic orchestral music)

33:25.783 --> 33:27.523
- Good evening, I'm Bill Cromwell.

33:27.523 --> 33:28.647
If you've just joined us,

33:28.647 --> 33:30.823
tonight there's terror on the freeway.

33:30.823 --> 33:32.821
As we follow live with exclusive coverage

33:32.821 --> 33:34.504
from Skycopter Eight,

33:34.504 --> 33:37.326
a high-speed chase is now in progress.

33:37.326 --> 33:39.706
Channel Eight news has
learned that Newport Beach

33:39.706 --> 33:42.703
millionaire Dalton Voss's
daughter, Natalie Voss,

33:42.703 --> 33:47.703
is being held hostage by this
man, Jackson Davis Hammond.

33:47.844 --> 33:48.677
Wendy?

33:48.677 --> 33:49.510
- Jack?

33:49.510 --> 33:51.758
- Jackson Hammond, also known
as the red-nosed robber,

33:51.758 --> 33:54.757
was scheduled to begin serving
a 25-year prison sentence

33:54.757 --> 33:58.380
for an armed bank robbery
in 1991, before he escaped

33:58.380 --> 33:59.972
just 24 hours ago.

33:59.972 --> 34:01.716
Sounds pretty serious, Bill.
- Oh, Jack.

34:01.716 --> 34:03.109
- How right you are, Wendy.

34:03.109 --> 34:06.111
Police are mum on Hammond's
specific ransom demands,

34:06.111 --> 34:08.539
obviously trying to negotiate a safe end

34:08.539 --> 34:11.871
to this horrific saga for Miss Voss.

34:11.871 --> 34:13.512
- Jack, you idiot.

34:13.512 --> 34:16.668
(heavy rock music)

34:16.668 --> 34:19.335
(siren wailing)

34:20.495 --> 34:23.114
- Look at all those cops.

34:23.114 --> 34:26.735
- Nobody has ever talked
that way to my father before.

34:26.735 --> 34:28.866
- That's because everybody
wants something from him,

34:28.866 --> 34:30.290
including you.

34:30.290 --> 34:31.123
- Me?

34:31.123 --> 34:32.366
I don't want anything from my father.

34:32.366 --> 34:33.668
- [Jack] Sure, you do.

34:33.668 --> 34:34.684
- Like what?

34:34.684 --> 34:35.516
- Like love, for instance.

34:35.516 --> 34:36.654
Respect.

34:36.654 --> 34:39.395
To be treated like a
human being, like a woman.

34:39.395 --> 34:40.514
Not like some baby girl,

34:40.514 --> 34:42.585
which is obviously how he still sees you.

34:42.585 --> 34:43.502
Am I right?

34:44.554 --> 34:45.630
- Maybe.

34:45.630 --> 34:47.116
- I think I'm right.

34:47.116 --> 34:48.851
- You know, there's a big responsibility

34:48.851 --> 34:51.929
to being Dalton Voss's daughter.

34:51.929 --> 34:54.750
I never asked to be born to Dalton Voss.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.354
I just want to be like everybody else.

34:57.354 --> 35:00.302
- Now that's not a 100% true, is it?

35:00.302 --> 35:01.956
- Yes, it is.

35:01.956 --> 35:03.999
- You mean, you'd rather be driving around

35:03.999 --> 35:07.879
in a primered, used Chevy
Nova than this brand-new BMW?

35:07.879 --> 35:09.086
Get real.

35:09.086 --> 35:11.130
- It really wouldn't matter to me.

35:11.130 --> 35:12.333
- Whatever.

35:12.333 --> 35:13.609
- It's true.

35:13.609 --> 35:15.073
Once you've had money all of your life,

35:15.073 --> 35:17.036
it's not that big of a deal anymore.

35:17.036 --> 35:18.652
- Hey, honey, when you don't have money

35:18.652 --> 35:22.182
all your life, believe
me, it's a very big deal.

35:22.182 --> 35:25.693
♪ She's talking to herself ♪

35:25.693 --> 35:28.411
- You guys ever been on
a chase this long before?

35:28.411 --> 35:29.658
- [Dobbs] Are you kidding?

35:29.658 --> 35:31.725
We go on chases all the time.

35:31.725 --> 35:33.587
- Never this long though.

35:33.587 --> 35:35.232
- [Dobbs] Not this long, exactly.

35:35.232 --> 35:38.149
But yeah, we go on a lot of chases.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.693
- [Man] Do you ever get scared?

35:41.693 --> 35:43.590
- This, this is off the record, right?

35:43.590 --> 35:45.053
- [Man] Of course.

35:45.053 --> 35:46.893
- Scared shitless.

35:46.893 --> 35:48.133
- We're no wimps though.

35:48.133 --> 35:50.010
- No, I'm not saying we're wimps.

35:50.010 --> 35:54.195
It's just that, we're just
people, like everybody else.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.793
- Well, obviously we're people.

35:55.793 --> 35:58.216
Standard issue street soldiers.

35:58.216 --> 36:00.966
- Standard issue street soldiers.

36:02.172 --> 36:03.691
That's a great tag line.

36:03.691 --> 36:04.581
- Thanks.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.664
Came up with that myself.

36:08.606 --> 36:10.687
- So why do you hate your stepmom?

36:10.687 --> 36:13.748
- What makes you think I do?

36:13.748 --> 36:15.483
- Just a hunch.

36:15.483 --> 36:16.466
- She's a twit.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.364
She obviously married
my father for his money,

36:18.364 --> 36:20.571
but he's too stupid to notice.

36:20.571 --> 36:22.691
She tries to control
everything and everybody,

36:22.691 --> 36:25.129
but she can't control me.

36:25.129 --> 36:26.576
- Sounds like chaos.

36:26.576 --> 36:27.811
- I should have gone away to college.

36:27.811 --> 36:30.891
Then I wouldn't have to
listen to their bitching.

36:30.891 --> 36:33.707
- [Jack] What about your real mom?

36:33.707 --> 36:35.448
- She lives in LA.

36:35.448 --> 36:36.281
- Don't tell me.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.314
You don't like her either, right?

36:38.314 --> 36:39.992
- No, I do.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.159
It's just that

36:42.855 --> 36:46.222
she'd rather be my best
friend than my mom.

36:46.222 --> 36:49.774
God, I get so frustrated,
I just wanna do something.

36:49.774 --> 36:50.671
- Like what?

36:50.671 --> 36:51.504
- I don't know.

36:51.504 --> 36:52.337
Something!

36:52.337 --> 36:56.087
Something other than
what I'm supposed to do.

36:58.832 --> 37:01.999
(helicopter whirring)

37:03.712 --> 37:05.015
- [Byron] If you look
now, you'll see how people

37:05.015 --> 37:07.788
are just opening up, allowing
this car to pass freely.

37:07.788 --> 37:09.517
It's amazing that this far the police

37:09.517 --> 37:11.961
(door buzzing)
haven't been able to stop him.

37:11.961 --> 37:13.164
- Oh, wonderful.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.799
Here comes the circus.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.882
- What is she doing here?

37:18.284 --> 37:21.197
- I happen to be the
girl's mother, thank you.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.263
How's my baby?

37:22.263 --> 37:23.533
- She seems just fine, Mrs. Voss.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.472
We're doing everything we can.

37:25.472 --> 37:26.787
- Ha, that's a laugh.

37:26.787 --> 37:27.827
- What's the matter, Dalton?

37:27.827 --> 37:30.067
Haven't you been able to
buy things right this time?

37:30.067 --> 37:31.566
- Dalton, don't listen to that.

37:31.566 --> 37:33.043
- The truth hurts, doesn't it?

37:33.043 --> 37:35.267
- Frances, I am not in the mood.

37:35.267 --> 37:37.507
- Dalton, you were never in the mood.

37:37.507 --> 37:38.340
- I never!

37:38.340 --> 37:40.231
- I never did either, married to him.

37:40.231 --> 37:41.581
- Folks, folks, come on now.

37:41.581 --> 37:44.284
I know this tension is
unsettling, but please.

37:44.284 --> 37:46.205
This bickering amongst yourselves

37:46.205 --> 37:48.162
doesn't get us anything.

37:48.162 --> 37:51.098
Hodges, get the Vosses and Mr., uh--

37:51.098 --> 37:52.535
- Macenernie.

37:52.535 --> 37:54.365
- Macenernie, some coffee.

37:54.365 --> 37:55.282
- Yes, sir.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.817
- Chief, there's a Mr. Ari
Josephson on the phone.

37:59.817 --> 38:01.440
He's Hammond's attorney
from San Francisco.

38:01.440 --> 38:05.107
- Well, why the hell
didn't you come get me?

38:08.713 --> 38:09.739
This is Chief Boyle.

38:09.739 --> 38:10.572
Talk to me.

38:10.572 --> 38:11.693
- Chief, this is Ari Josephson.

38:11.693 --> 38:13.119
I'm Jackson Hammond's attorney.

38:13.119 --> 38:14.333
I just now found out about the predicament

38:14.333 --> 38:16.277
my client got into down there.

38:16.277 --> 38:17.408
I think I can help.

38:17.408 --> 38:18.735
If I could just talk to him,

38:18.735 --> 38:20.775
I think I can get him to listen to reason.

38:20.775 --> 38:21.975
He listens to me.

38:21.975 --> 38:22.974
- Do what you gotta do.

38:22.974 --> 38:25.135
Only get him to let
that girl out of the car

38:25.135 --> 38:27.098
or Voss'll have all our heads!

38:27.098 --> 38:29.119
- Chief, I know Jackson Hammond.

38:29.119 --> 38:31.180
The girl is gonna be just fine.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.139
- This is Corey Steinhoff

38:32.139 --> 38:34.017
standing on the shoulder
of the southbound lane

38:34.017 --> 38:36.539
of the five freeway just
past the Landview exit.

38:36.539 --> 38:38.452
Behind me, traffic appears
to be flowing normally.

38:38.452 --> 38:42.084
However, in the next few seconds
Channel 17, Hardcore News,

38:42.084 --> 38:43.842
will bring you the first
live, on-the-ground shots

38:43.842 --> 38:46.248
of the hair-raising chase
that Jackson Hammond--

38:46.248 --> 38:48.201
(siren wailing)

38:48.201 --> 38:51.278
Here they come, here they come!

38:51.278 --> 38:54.195
(heavy rock music)

39:01.457 --> 39:04.624
(helicopter whirring)

39:07.982 --> 39:11.801
- Uh, Byron, can you get
us closer to that BMW?

39:11.801 --> 39:14.019
We want to get a glimpse
into one of those windows,

39:14.019 --> 39:17.926
and maybe we can see
if miss Voss is tied up

39:17.926 --> 39:21.176
or, or otherwise restrained in any way.

39:22.121 --> 39:23.789
- Well, as you can see,

39:23.789 --> 39:25.859
from the angle that I'm at,

39:25.859 --> 39:29.738
it's, uh, it's pretty hard to
get a look into the window.

39:29.738 --> 39:32.741
I mean, this baby is moving fast!

39:32.741 --> 39:34.766
- [DJ] And Natalie Voss,
daughter of billionaire--

39:34.766 --> 39:36.341
- Hey, hey, you're on the radio.

39:36.341 --> 39:40.235
- [DJ] Are halfway to Tijuana
right now in her hijacked BMW.

39:40.235 --> 39:41.512
Dalton Voss, you will remember,

39:41.512 --> 39:43.931
was recently the subject of public outcry

39:43.931 --> 39:45.995
when he decided to tear down 14 blocks

39:45.995 --> 39:47.915
of low-income housing in east LA

39:47.915 --> 39:50.088
to build a mid-city commuter airport.

(phone beeping)

40:20.372 --> 40:21.539
Domino's Pizza!

40:21.539 --> 40:23.632
- Jack, it's me, Ari.

40:23.632 --> 40:24.822
- It's my lawyer.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.075
- [Ari] Jack?

40:26.075 --> 40:27.592
- Ari, I told you never to call me here.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.214
- Jack, this is wrong.

40:29.214 --> 40:31.509
This is very, very wrong.

40:31.509 --> 40:32.689
I mean, I know you're disappointed.

40:32.689 --> 40:33.691
- Disappointed?

40:33.691 --> 40:34.524
How about destroyed, Ari?

40:34.524 --> 40:36.111
How about devastated?

40:36.111 --> 40:38.452
- Jack, this is not the
way to beat the system.

40:38.452 --> 40:39.972
- Screw the system.

40:39.972 --> 40:42.015
- No, not screw the system.

40:42.015 --> 40:44.415
Massage the system, play
the system, work the system,

40:44.415 --> 40:45.871
but don't screw the system

40:45.871 --> 40:47.972
because the system's gonna screw you more.

40:47.972 --> 40:49.221
- I massaged the system.

40:49.221 --> 40:50.054
Didn't I?

40:50.054 --> 40:50.947
Huh?

40:50.947 --> 40:53.415
Didn't I do everything right?

40:53.415 --> 40:54.535
- Yeah, you did.

40:54.535 --> 40:55.675
- Yeah, damn straight I did.

40:55.675 --> 40:56.876
Where did it get me?

40:56.876 --> 40:57.709
San Quentin.

40:57.709 --> 40:58.929
- You can't give up now.

40:58.929 --> 40:59.841
- What do you want me to do?

40:59.841 --> 41:01.346
Sit around and rot for the next 25 years

41:01.346 --> 41:03.796
while you come up with a better idea?

41:03.796 --> 41:05.193
Wait a minute, Ari.

41:05.193 --> 41:06.071
Now I'm a kidnapper.

41:06.071 --> 41:08.015
I'm probably looking at life.

41:08.015 --> 41:09.556
Ah, forget it, pal.

41:09.556 --> 41:11.092
This just ain't my year.

41:11.092 --> 41:13.592
- Look, Jack, why don't
you just let the girl out?

41:13.592 --> 41:16.005
Nobody's gonna hurt you if
you just give yourself up.

41:16.005 --> 41:17.019
You'll come back, we'll talk,

41:17.019 --> 41:18.907
we'll figure something else out.

41:18.907 --> 41:20.667
Maybe we can get the public behind you.

41:20.667 --> 41:23.861
Public outcry against injustice
is a very powerful tool.

41:23.861 --> 41:25.984
- Oh, yeah, the public's
gonna love my ass.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.960
The red-nosed robber
kidnaps the richest girl

41:27.960 --> 41:29.633
in the country.

41:29.633 --> 41:31.602
Probably get my own sitcom.

41:31.602 --> 41:33.565
- Don't underestimate the public.

41:33.565 --> 41:34.810
- I ain't stopping.

41:34.810 --> 41:37.346
I'm taking this one all the way to Mexico.

41:37.346 --> 41:38.717
I'm going Latin, chief.

41:38.717 --> 41:40.743
- Jack, mexico isn't the answer.

41:40.743 --> 41:41.658
You're innocent.

41:41.658 --> 41:42.619
We'll get a retrial,

41:42.619 --> 41:44.678
we'll get that blood test admissible.

41:44.678 --> 41:45.698
You'll eventually get out.

41:45.698 --> 41:46.837
So just stop the damn car,

41:46.837 --> 41:48.962
give yourself up before it's too late.

41:48.962 --> 41:50.189
- Look, Ari, in case I don't get

41:50.189 --> 41:51.480
another chance to say this,

41:51.480 --> 41:55.502
I just wanted to say
thanks for everything.

41:55.502 --> 41:57.636
You're really the only honest man I know.

41:57.636 --> 42:00.070
You did something nobody
else ever did, Ari.

42:00.070 --> 42:01.653
You believed in me.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.125
I really appreciate that.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.844
- [Ari] Jack, quit talking crazy.

42:05.844 --> 42:07.567
You're talking like it's over.

42:07.567 --> 42:08.963
Listen, I still believe in you.

42:08.963 --> 42:10.002
I'm still working hard.

42:10.002 --> 42:11.142
We can beat this thing together.

42:11.142 --> 42:12.966
I can get you out.

42:12.966 --> 42:14.883
- I'm already out, Ari.

42:15.815 --> 42:16.827
I'm already out.

42:16.827 --> 42:18.145
(phone beeping)

42:18.145 --> 42:23.145
(light rock music)
(siren wailing)

42:24.727 --> 42:27.165
- I don't want my kids to be cops.

42:27.165 --> 42:29.106
No, I'm out here every day risking my life

42:29.106 --> 42:31.949
so they can have it better than me.

42:31.949 --> 42:33.904
I got a kid who wants to be an astronaut.

42:33.904 --> 42:35.781
I'd like to keep it that way.

42:35.781 --> 42:38.269
Besides, being a cop
messes with your head.

42:38.269 --> 42:39.102
- How so?

42:40.097 --> 42:42.146
- I mean, every day, day in, day out,

42:42.146 --> 42:44.027
you're dealing' with
the scum of the earth.

42:44.027 --> 42:45.789
I mean the only people
you come into contact with

42:45.789 --> 42:48.956
are dope pushers and pimps and killers

42:49.906 --> 42:51.163
and child molesters.

42:51.163 --> 42:55.806
Pretty soon you start thinking
that everybody's rotten.

42:55.806 --> 42:58.290
(phone ringing)

42:58.290 --> 42:59.381
- [Jack] Ari, I told you that--

42:59.381 --> 43:00.384
- [Jerry] Jack Hammond.

43:00.384 --> 43:03.327
Jerry Kunkle, Channel
Nine, Hardcore News live.

43:03.327 --> 43:06.004
While I have you on this Channel
Nine exclusive interview,

43:06.004 --> 43:07.718
let me ask you a question I know is

43:07.718 --> 43:09.800
on the minds of all our viewers.

43:09.800 --> 43:10.980
Just what do you intend to do

43:10.980 --> 43:13.480
when that car runs out of gas?

43:14.564 --> 43:17.380
- That's the question on the
minds of all your viewers?

43:17.380 --> 43:19.523
Whether I'll run out of gas or not?

43:19.523 --> 43:20.922
Tell you what, Jer.

43:20.922 --> 43:24.528
You let your viewers know
that I hope Miss Voss's fear

43:24.528 --> 43:28.962
and my desperation are
entertainment enough for them.

43:28.962 --> 43:31.162
After all, that's what
this is all about, right?

43:31.162 --> 43:33.322
What makes for good television?

43:33.322 --> 43:35.380
The story as it breaks, live,

43:35.380 --> 43:37.823
coming to you from the bad guy himself?

43:37.823 --> 43:39.204
I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers

43:39.204 --> 43:42.065
to change the fucking channel, would we?

43:42.065 --> 43:44.678
(electricity crackling)

43:44.678 --> 43:47.478
(sighing)

43:47.478 --> 43:50.561
What the hell's this world coming to?

43:51.419 --> 43:52.252
- Nice.

43:53.672 --> 43:54.533
- I'm sorry.

43:54.533 --> 43:56.533
I'll buy you a new one.

43:56.533 --> 43:58.248
- [Man Over Radio] Subject
has just passed Flower Bowl.

43:58.248 --> 43:59.438
I'm about 30 yards back.

43:59.438 --> 44:00.470
Stay with him.

44:00.470 --> 44:01.705
I'm coming on your right.

44:01.705 --> 44:02.538
- [Man] I can't see him.

44:02.538 --> 44:03.684
Where is he?

44:03.684 --> 44:05.344
- [Man On Radio] He's in
front of the Pier One truck!

44:05.344 --> 44:06.177
- All right.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.827
We just passed the Flower Bowl.

44:07.827 --> 44:09.792
They'll be coming up pretty soon.

44:09.792 --> 44:11.917
So just slow down a little, Dale.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.237
- I'm pumped, man.

44:13.237 --> 44:14.858
Pumped!

44:14.858 --> 44:16.489
Stupid cops.

44:16.489 --> 44:17.547
- Stupid!

44:17.547 --> 44:20.897
- Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed.

44:20.897 --> 44:21.790
You see him yet?

44:21.790 --> 44:22.917
- [Will] No, not yet.

44:22.917 --> 44:24.794
- When you see him, tell me quick!

44:24.794 --> 44:25.627
- I will!

44:26.868 --> 44:27.701
Now--

44:27.701 --> 44:28.534
- Yeah?

44:28.534 --> 44:30.275
- When I give the order, you ram him hard

44:30.275 --> 44:32.234
into the guard rail, Dale.

44:32.234 --> 44:34.017
That'll stop him.

44:34.017 --> 44:35.040
- I'm a road warrior!

44:35.040 --> 44:36.136
- [Will] I know you are, Dale.

44:36.136 --> 44:36.969
- I am.

44:36.969 --> 44:39.497
- Time to stop those
little yuppie punks, Dale!

44:39.497 --> 44:41.928
- Dude, are we gonna be on TV?

44:41.928 --> 44:42.975
- You know we are, dude.

44:42.975 --> 44:43.977
- [Dale] That's hot.

44:43.977 --> 44:45.031
- You know we are.

44:45.031 --> 44:48.330
- Did either of you ever
actually kill anybody?

44:48.330 --> 44:49.163
- Not yet.

44:50.815 --> 44:51.648
- I did.

44:55.935 --> 44:57.435
- How did it feel?

44:58.473 --> 45:00.953
- It didn't feel like I thought it would.

45:00.953 --> 45:02.873
It felt shitty.

45:02.873 --> 45:04.040
It felt wrong.

45:04.975 --> 45:06.914
But what can you do?

45:06.914 --> 45:09.555
- Partner, there's nothing you could do.

45:09.555 --> 45:12.057
- That's what I keep telling myself.

45:12.057 --> 45:13.423
Of course I'd do it again if I had to.

45:13.423 --> 45:14.352
I mean, it's my job.

45:14.352 --> 45:16.188
(video rewinding)
(camera beeping)

45:16.188 --> 45:17.187
- Hold that thought.

45:17.187 --> 45:18.510
I gotta change tapes.

45:18.510 --> 45:20.073
- This is great stuff, guys.

45:20.073 --> 45:22.026
I mean, really, really, really good stuff.

45:22.026 --> 45:23.148
Real true-to-life.

45:23.148 --> 45:23.981
I love it.

45:23.981 --> 45:24.814
- Thanks.

45:24.814 --> 45:25.725
Thanks a lot.

45:25.725 --> 45:27.188
(heavy rock music)

45:27.188 --> 45:29.938
(all chattering)

45:31.145 --> 45:33.062
- [Man] Come on, Billy.

45:34.700 --> 45:35.572
All right, come on down!

45:35.572 --> 45:37.072
Set it right here!

45:38.596 --> 45:39.596
That's good!

45:40.433 --> 45:43.183
- [SWAT Member] Move, move, move!

45:46.104 --> 45:48.771
(siren wailing)

45:51.687 --> 45:53.470
- [Man] I want you over there.

45:53.470 --> 45:54.303
Hey!

45:54.303 --> 45:55.136
Watch it.

46:02.422 --> 46:03.339
- We're up.

46:06.124 --> 46:07.987
- Bill, Wendy, Tom Capone standing here

46:07.987 --> 46:10.571
at the border between
California and Tijuana.

46:10.571 --> 46:12.309
As you can see behind me,

46:12.309 --> 46:15.551
the San Diego PD and the
CHP are working feverishly

46:15.551 --> 46:18.128
to create an impenetrable wall of force

46:18.128 --> 46:20.229
here at the gateway into Mexico

46:20.229 --> 46:22.438
in hopes of stopping this heinous chase

46:22.438 --> 46:23.829
from crossing the border.

46:23.829 --> 46:25.304
Is such a radical measure safe

46:25.304 --> 46:26.709
for the captive miss Voss?

46:26.709 --> 46:28.229
The San Diego PD says yes,

46:28.229 --> 46:29.429
the critics say no,

46:29.429 --> 46:31.431
but only time will tell.

46:31.431 --> 46:33.622
(heavy rock music)

46:33.622 --> 46:35.500
- [Man] Hello, San Diego.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.667
- [Man Over Radio] Afternoon, Newport.

46:50.315 --> 46:52.268
- What are you doing?

46:52.268 --> 46:54.703
- I was going to offer you a piece of gum.

46:54.703 --> 46:55.536
- Oh.

47:00.047 --> 47:02.172
- What'd you think was in
there, a knife or something?

47:02.172 --> 47:04.005
- You could have mace.

47:05.292 --> 47:07.292
- If I had mace, I would
have used it by now.

47:07.292 --> 47:08.783
You're not a smart criminal.

47:08.783 --> 47:09.616
- Thank you.

47:09.616 --> 47:12.610
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

47:12.610 --> 47:17.432
- So are you gonna tell
me why you're on the run?

47:17.432 --> 47:19.444
- You wouldn't believe me.

47:19.444 --> 47:21.885
I'm not so sure I believe me anymore.

47:21.885 --> 47:22.718
- Try me.

47:23.910 --> 47:25.486
- Promise you won't laugh.

47:25.486 --> 47:27.153
- Why would I laugh?

47:29.448 --> 47:31.592
- Okay, two years ago,
I'm sitting' at home,

47:31.592 --> 47:33.348
watching' a ball game.

47:33.348 --> 47:34.667
Dodgers are losing.

47:34.667 --> 47:36.384
- I hate the dodgers.

47:36.384 --> 47:38.749
- You wanna hear this or not?

47:38.749 --> 47:39.749
- I'm sorry.

47:42.472 --> 47:43.469
- At the same time,

47:43.469 --> 47:45.170
on the other side of the city,

47:45.170 --> 47:48.085
there's some guy robbing a
bank, dressed like a clown.

47:48.085 --> 47:49.330
- A clown?

47:49.330 --> 47:50.872
- Yes, a clown.

47:50.872 --> 47:53.469
It seems that some jerk had
knocked off several banks

47:53.469 --> 47:54.925
in a clown outfit.

47:54.925 --> 47:56.749
The media, in all of their originality,

47:56.749 --> 48:00.130
picked up on this and labeled
him the red-nosed robber.

48:00.130 --> 48:02.787
So I'm coming out of
Osco's a couple days later.

48:02.787 --> 48:04.552
There's two cops waiting for me.

48:04.552 --> 48:06.575
Bang, they pick me up, haul me in.

48:06.575 --> 48:08.314
- Why would they haul you in?

48:08.314 --> 48:09.887
- Let me get to that.

48:09.887 --> 48:12.109
I was stuck in Sonoma.

48:12.109 --> 48:14.450
The only job I could wrangle was playing

48:14.450 --> 48:16.647
a clown at kids' birthday parties,

48:16.647 --> 48:18.540
which wasn't such a bad gig.

48:18.540 --> 48:21.170
Flexible hours, a lot of free cake.

48:21.170 --> 48:23.149
One of my neighbors, some old battle-ax,

48:23.149 --> 48:24.648
sees the story on the news.

48:24.648 --> 48:26.231
She calls the cops.

48:27.225 --> 48:29.125
They get a search warrant,
crash down the door,

48:29.125 --> 48:31.413
they find the costume.

48:31.413 --> 48:32.552
It's all over.

48:32.552 --> 48:34.850
- Did you have to wear those big shoes?

48:34.850 --> 48:36.508
I knew you'd make fun of me.

48:36.508 --> 48:37.688
- I'm sorry.

48:37.688 --> 48:39.344
I'm not, I'm not.

48:39.344 --> 48:40.406
Go on.

48:40.406 --> 48:41.787
- So Ari keeps saying, "Don't worry.

48:41.787 --> 48:44.047
"They don't put innocent people in jail."

48:44.047 --> 48:47.797
Well, he was obviously
wrong because they do.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.241
What are you looking at?

48:54.241 --> 48:56.747
- I don't quite picture you as a clown.

48:56.747 --> 48:58.145
- So you don't believe me.

48:58.145 --> 48:59.825
- I didn't say that.

48:59.825 --> 49:00.702
- They're here!

49:00.702 --> 49:01.700
That's them!

49:01.700 --> 49:04.617
(heavy rock music)

49:07.147 --> 49:07.980
Ram 'em!

49:07.980 --> 49:09.952
- Time to be heroes!

49:09.952 --> 49:11.476
(Natalie screaming)

49:11.476 --> 49:12.309
Missed 'em!

49:12.309 --> 49:13.954
- Hey, look out!

49:13.954 --> 49:15.886
- Adjust, Dale!

49:15.886 --> 49:16.960
- [Natalie] Jack!

49:16.960 --> 49:18.824
- [Dobbs] What the hell is that guy doing?

49:18.824 --> 49:20.210
- Okay, I got it, I got it!

49:20.210 --> 49:23.127
(tires screeching)

49:24.939 --> 49:26.566
- Back the other way!

49:26.566 --> 49:29.162
(tires screeching)

49:29.162 --> 49:30.350
- Whoa!

49:30.350 --> 49:33.267
(tires screeching)

49:35.345 --> 49:36.502
- Oh, no!

49:36.502 --> 49:38.111
(tires screeching)

49:38.111 --> 49:41.194
(truck horn honking)

49:43.266 --> 49:45.481
- Holy mother of god!

49:45.481 --> 49:47.898
- You've gotta be kidding me.

49:48.878 --> 49:51.211
(screaming)

49:55.541 --> 49:57.026
- Oh, my god!

49:57.026 --> 49:57.899
Do something!

49:57.899 --> 49:58.732
- Bill, Wendy!

49:58.732 --> 50:01.565
Are you seeing this in the studio?

50:02.468 --> 50:03.718
- Do something!

50:04.583 --> 50:07.401
(tires screeching)

50:07.401 --> 50:08.318
Oh, my god!

50:11.681 --> 50:14.014
(screaming)

50:22.659 --> 50:25.492
(truck exploding)

50:29.981 --> 50:33.146
(sirens wailing)

50:33.146 --> 50:35.896
- Astonishing and tragic imagery.

50:36.869 --> 50:39.066
A green monster truck,

50:39.066 --> 50:41.829
obviously an undercover
law enforcement vehicle,

50:41.829 --> 50:45.306
made a valiant attempt
to sideswipe the BMW,

50:45.306 --> 50:48.069
with disastrous results.

50:48.069 --> 50:50.389
- Almost ready, Mr. Josephson.

50:50.389 --> 50:52.381
- That was a pretty dangerous
and radical maneuver

50:52.381 --> 50:54.563
from the police, especially
with a hostage at risk

50:54.563 --> 50:56.448
and that roadblock up ahead.

50:56.448 --> 50:57.944
Wouldn't you say, Byron?

50:57.944 --> 50:58.824
- Radical?

50:58.824 --> 50:59.657
Yes.

50:59.657 --> 51:02.309
But I imagine these cops are
getting awfully desperate.

51:02.309 --> 51:03.142
- [Cameraman] Three, two.

51:03.142 --> 51:03.975
You're on.

51:03.975 --> 51:04.808
- Randy, thank you very much.

51:04.808 --> 51:06.829
This is Paul Dandridge
with Channel Three's live,

51:06.829 --> 51:08.130
on-the-scene, exclusive interview

51:08.130 --> 51:11.285
with Jackson Hammond's
attorney, Ari Josephson.

51:11.285 --> 51:14.370
Mr. Josephson, if Mr. Hammond is innocent,

51:14.370 --> 51:18.887
why was he found guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt by a jury?

51:18.887 --> 51:20.068
- During the bank robbery,

51:20.068 --> 51:22.087
the actual thief cut his hand

51:22.087 --> 51:24.589
on the teller's paper spindle.

51:24.589 --> 51:26.293
A sample of that dried blood

51:26.293 --> 51:28.462
was taken and tested and
compared with a sample

51:28.462 --> 51:29.803
of my client's blood.

51:29.803 --> 51:31.894
Jack's blood is type B positive.

51:31.894 --> 51:33.870
The red-nosed robber's blood

51:33.870 --> 51:36.342
is type A, but because
the evidence was collected

51:36.342 --> 51:38.590
improperly from the crime scene,

51:38.590 --> 51:40.319
it was deemed inadmissible in court.

51:40.319 --> 51:41.152
- Thank you very much.

51:41.152 --> 51:42.773
Let's go back to the studio.

51:42.773 --> 51:45.690
(heavy rock music)

51:47.680 --> 51:48.849
- Hey, hey, look at that.

51:48.849 --> 51:51.067
You're a folk hero already.

51:51.067 --> 51:52.390
- I don't care.

51:52.390 --> 51:55.143
If you ask me, I think
your lawyer's right,

51:55.143 --> 51:56.529
you should keep on fighting.

51:56.529 --> 51:58.107
- Almost sounds like you believe me.

51:58.107 --> 51:59.337
- You don't strike me as the kind of guy

51:59.337 --> 52:01.214
who gives up that easily.

52:01.214 --> 52:03.547
- What makes you think that?

52:04.383 --> 52:05.943
Ah, that.

52:05.943 --> 52:07.471
- Yeah, that.

52:07.471 --> 52:08.804
- I'm 28 years old, Natalie.

52:08.804 --> 52:10.119
I got a lot of good years ahead of me.

52:10.119 --> 52:12.038
I'm not going to waste
them away in some prison.

52:12.038 --> 52:12.871
- Yeah, but--

52:12.871 --> 52:13.827
- Yeah, but what?

52:13.827 --> 52:14.963
While you're out getting married

52:14.963 --> 52:17.703
and taking vacations and having barbecues

52:17.703 --> 52:19.603
in the backyard and getting all excited

52:19.603 --> 52:21.736
about your kid's first tooth,

52:21.736 --> 52:23.873
I'll be in a concrete cell surrounded

52:23.873 --> 52:26.287
by murderers and rapists,

52:26.287 --> 52:28.604
large hairy-backed men who
think I have a real cute ass.

52:28.604 --> 52:30.822
I'm sorry, but it's just not my style.

52:30.822 --> 52:33.203
- There's got to be something you can do.

52:33.203 --> 52:34.847
I mean, if the blood
test proves it, why can't

52:34.847 --> 52:37.944
you just stand up in court and scream it?

52:37.944 --> 52:40.266
This is your life we're talking about.

52:40.266 --> 52:41.853
- They've got all these little rules

52:41.853 --> 52:44.353
and precedents and procedures

52:44.353 --> 52:46.963
and legal loopholes and
all these fancy words

52:46.963 --> 52:49.327
and books, all this crap that's more

52:49.327 --> 52:51.887
important than a human being.

52:51.887 --> 52:53.386
- So that's it?

52:53.386 --> 52:54.969
- Just about, yeah.

52:57.342 --> 52:59.287
- When were you sentenced?

52:59.287 --> 53:00.870
- [Jack] Yesterday.

53:02.185 --> 53:03.927
- So that's why you ran?

53:03.927 --> 53:05.309
- Yep.

53:05.309 --> 53:07.186
- [Natalie] And that's
why you stole the car.

53:07.186 --> 53:08.019
- Yep.

53:10.188 --> 53:11.287
- And that's why you freaked out

53:11.287 --> 53:14.234
when you saw the cops and grabbed me?

53:14.234 --> 53:16.817
- You're catching on fast, kid.

53:19.549 --> 53:21.216
- I don't blame you.

53:23.422 --> 53:27.005
I do not know why, but
I believe you, Jack.

53:29.456 --> 53:30.670
- Thanks.

53:30.670 --> 53:32.587
That means a lot to me.

53:38.729 --> 53:40.322
(sirens wailing)

53:40.322 --> 53:42.771
- And so to be able to almost bust someone

53:42.771 --> 53:44.233
before they do the crime,

53:44.233 --> 53:46.729
you have to be somewhat telepathic.

53:46.729 --> 53:49.849
So that's why I see myself
as almost a prophet.

53:49.849 --> 53:53.014
A street prophet, if you will.

53:53.014 --> 53:54.284
- I got to change microphones.

53:54.284 --> 53:55.117
- What?

53:55.117 --> 53:56.255
- [Cameraman] I gotta fix the mic.

53:56.255 --> 53:57.088
It'll just take a second here.

53:57.088 --> 53:58.168
Hold still.

53:58.168 --> 53:59.585
I gotta get that.

54:00.616 --> 54:02.258
- Back off, back off, will you!

54:02.258 --> 54:03.745
That's dangerous!

54:03.745 --> 54:06.625
- Get down, you stupid little nothing!

54:06.625 --> 54:07.556

54:07.556 --> 54:08.684

54:20.464 --> 54:21.459
- What is this?

54:21.459 --> 54:22.292
- What?

54:22.292 --> 54:24.209
- I don't believe this.

54:25.516 --> 54:27.498
- This is Frank Smuntz, Channel 12

54:27.498 --> 54:29.418
San Diego Evening News,

54:29.418 --> 54:32.618
riding in the thick of the
police high-speed chase.

54:32.618 --> 54:34.538
As you can see, channel 12 is the first

54:34.538 --> 54:37.557
newscast to get a close-up
look into the face

54:37.557 --> 54:39.297
of this runaway horror.

54:39.297 --> 54:41.301
If we're lucky, we're
hoping to get a visual

54:41.301 --> 54:44.806
conformation on the
condition of the hostage.

54:44.806 --> 54:45.639
Miss Voss!

54:47.633 --> 54:48.466
Miss Voss!

54:50.038 --> 54:53.621
Can you give us a
thumbs-up if you're okay?

54:54.951 --> 54:57.445
- [Jack] Right here, pal.

54:57.445 --> 54:59.937
- Can we show that on TV?

54:59.937 --> 55:03.241
(screaming)
(car horn honking)

55:03.241 --> 55:04.074
Whoops.

55:04.074 --> 55:05.428
(static hissing)

55:05.428 --> 55:08.423
- If you call that any kind of movement.

55:08.423 --> 55:10.020
Uh, Frank?

55:10.020 --> 55:11.666
Frank?

55:11.666 --> 55:14.708
- Um, it appears we've lost our feed there

55:14.708 --> 55:17.531
from Frank Smuntz, riding right alongside

55:17.531 --> 55:19.031
that speeding BMW.

55:20.321 --> 55:21.569
Lolly.

55:21.569 --> 55:22.463
- Thanks, Steve.

55:22.463 --> 55:24.962
I think before we continue
we should take a moment

55:24.962 --> 55:26.308
to apologize to our viewers

55:26.308 --> 55:28.468
for that obscene gesture
you just saw coming

55:28.468 --> 55:30.218
from the window of that speeding car.

55:30.218 --> 55:31.238
(laughing)

55:31.238 --> 55:32.241
- Yes.

55:32.241 --> 55:35.622
That's the risk we take with
live TV, isn't it, Lolly?

55:35.622 --> 55:36.721
- That's right.

55:36.721 --> 55:38.434
We'll be back with more live coverage

55:38.434 --> 55:40.633
of Kidnapped at 100 Miles Per Hour

55:40.633 --> 55:42.402
after these messages.

55:42.402 --> 55:44.735
(whooshing)

55:46.782 --> 55:48.883
- Oh, I've had my share of boyfriends.

55:48.883 --> 55:50.865
But they've all been losers.

55:50.865 --> 55:52.546
You know, boring.

55:52.546 --> 55:53.794
They'd have to be.

55:53.794 --> 55:55.644
My father had to approve of them all.

55:55.644 --> 55:57.269
- Old Dalt can't be that bad.

55:57.269 --> 55:59.109
He must have done something right.

55:59.109 --> 56:00.170
- Why?

56:00.170 --> 56:03.080
- Well, look how great
you turned out to be.

56:03.080 --> 56:03.986
- Oh, me?

56:03.986 --> 56:04.839
Come on.

56:04.839 --> 56:06.685
I'm a total basket case.

56:06.685 --> 56:08.240
You don't even know the half of it.

56:08.240 --> 56:09.117
- No, no.

56:09.117 --> 56:11.049
My intuition about people is very good.

56:11.049 --> 56:13.385
I could tell right away
you had your act together.

56:13.385 --> 56:14.262
- Yeah?

56:14.262 --> 56:15.820
When did you decide that?

56:15.820 --> 56:18.940
- In the convenience store
when we shared that look.

56:18.940 --> 56:19.773
Remember?

56:22.151 --> 56:22.984
- Yeah.

56:25.643 --> 56:28.389
- Thought to myself if
only life were different,

56:28.389 --> 56:31.424
maybe I could meet a
girl like that someday.

56:31.424 --> 56:32.426
- Really?

56:32.426 --> 56:33.786
- Swear to god.

56:33.786 --> 56:36.890
Believe it or not, when I was
holding the gun to your back,

56:36.890 --> 56:40.959
I couldn't help but notice
how lovely your hair smelled.

56:40.959 --> 56:42.246
- You're crazy.

56:42.246 --> 56:43.821
- That would be affirmative.

56:43.821 --> 56:46.250
- You know, you really
hurt me with that gun.

56:46.250 --> 56:49.167
You didn't have to jam
it into my back so hard.

56:49.167 --> 56:50.167
- I'm sorry.

56:51.269 --> 56:52.936
About the gun, uh...

56:58.207 --> 56:59.542
- What?

56:59.542 --> 57:02.890
- It makes a handy weapon in a pinch.

57:02.890 --> 57:05.386
- You kidnapped me with a candy bar?

57:05.386 --> 57:08.603
- Well, you have to admit
it was rather inventive.

57:08.603 --> 57:10.219
- Oh, god.

57:10.219 --> 57:11.261
- Don't be upset.

57:11.261 --> 57:12.949
If I'd had a real gun,
I would have used it.

57:12.949 --> 57:15.066
- It sure felt like a gun.

57:15.066 --> 57:15.965
- I thought for sure everybody

57:15.965 --> 57:17.727
would hear the wrapper crinkle.

57:17.727 --> 57:19.146
- Oh, god.

57:19.146 --> 57:21.282
I can just see the headline now.

57:21.282 --> 57:23.527
- Hey, hey, candy thief.

57:23.527 --> 57:27.610
- Kidnapper exposed when
candy gun melts in hand.

57:31.450 --> 57:32.447
- Hey, hey!

57:32.447 --> 57:33.280
Come on.

57:34.506 --> 57:35.421
Thanks.

57:35.421 --> 57:36.254
Thank you.

57:36.254 --> 57:37.287
(laughing)

57:37.287 --> 57:41.207
- If my father only knew you
kidnapped me with a candy bar.

57:41.207 --> 57:43.911
Think of the embarrassment.

57:43.911 --> 57:45.661
Oh, god, what a jerk.

57:47.047 --> 57:50.247
You know, he's probably thinking right now

57:50.247 --> 57:52.210
about how he can use all this publicity,

57:52.210 --> 57:55.671
'cause he wants to run for
governor of California.

57:55.671 --> 57:58.210
- Now listen, once this
whole fiasco is over,

57:58.210 --> 58:01.730
I want you to get me and
Natalie on AM San Diego

58:01.730 --> 58:03.810
and all the national morning shows.

58:03.810 --> 58:05.580
Call Ted Turner.

58:05.580 --> 58:07.725
Tell him I'll give him an exclusive first

58:07.725 --> 58:09.066
once this insane thing is wrapped up,

58:09.066 --> 58:12.311
in exchange for some good publicity.

58:12.311 --> 58:13.605
He owes me one.

58:13.605 --> 58:15.650
Uh, you get to work, I'll call you back.

58:15.650 --> 58:16.483
- Mr. Voss?

58:16.483 --> 58:17.316
- What is it?

58:17.316 --> 58:18.494
- Our chopper's back.

58:18.494 --> 58:20.211
- Well, it's about time.

58:20.211 --> 58:21.721
Get me to that barricade.

58:21.721 --> 58:22.554
- Thanks, Rocky.

58:22.554 --> 58:24.604
This is Paige Grunion with
Channel 17 Hardcore News.

58:24.604 --> 58:27.705
I am coming to you live on the
shoulder of the five freeway.

58:27.705 --> 58:29.724
And standing here with
me are Will and Dale.

58:29.724 --> 58:31.988
They are the drivers of
the green monster van.

58:31.988 --> 58:32.860
Tell me, gentlemen--

58:32.860 --> 58:34.113
- Monster truck.

58:34.113 --> 58:34.946
- Monster truck.

58:34.946 --> 58:36.789
What possessed you to take such radical

58:36.789 --> 58:39.691
and desperate measures to
stop the BMW yourselves?

58:39.691 --> 58:40.608
- Oh, dude!

58:41.492 --> 58:44.292
We are just doing our duty as Americans.

58:44.292 --> 58:45.165
Right, Will?

58:45.165 --> 58:45.998
- That's right.

58:45.998 --> 58:47.006
And that's not the first time

58:47.006 --> 58:48.790
we've had to take matters
into our own hands.

58:48.790 --> 58:51.746
Mark my words, they'll
be pulling over soon.

58:51.746 --> 58:53.030
- We really scared them.

58:53.030 --> 58:53.924
Didn't we, didn't we?

58:53.924 --> 58:55.170
- Did you see the look on their faces?

58:55.170 --> 58:56.489
- Sure did.
- Whoa!

58:56.489 --> 58:58.434
- And we'd be happy to
tell anyone about it.

58:58.434 --> 58:59.429
Anyone.
- Anytime!

58:59.429 --> 59:00.611
- On, on Oprah.

59:00.611 --> 59:01.580
Or Geraldo.

59:01.580 --> 59:03.127
Or Sally Jesse.

59:03.127 --> 59:04.563
Or any--
- Larry King, Larry king.

59:04.563 --> 59:06.783
- Yeah, or any of those shows.

59:06.783 --> 59:08.464
- That's right, and
you can usually find us

59:08.464 --> 59:09.964
at Big Willy's Dirty Dogs.

59:09.964 --> 59:11.185
Most times.

59:11.185 --> 59:12.583
My name is Will, and this is Dale.

59:12.583 --> 59:14.204
And we've been through
a lot of heavy stuff

59:14.204 --> 59:15.900
in that truck before.

59:15.900 --> 59:17.303
- Monster madness, dude.

59:17.303 --> 59:18.962
- Major monster madness.

59:18.962 --> 59:19.885
- Gentlemen, please.

59:19.885 --> 59:21.092
- What?
- But, but,

59:21.092 --> 59:22.488
we're not fooling around!

59:22.488 --> 59:23.360
We're not fooling around!

59:23.360 --> 59:24.193
- Get in the back.

59:24.193 --> 59:26.285
- Sometimes you got to
take the bull by the horns!

59:26.285 --> 59:28.616
We're American citizens!

59:28.616 --> 59:29.449
- And there you have it.

59:29.449 --> 59:31.878
Who says the great American
hero is a thing of the past?

59:31.878 --> 59:32.788
Back to you, Rocky,

59:32.788 --> 59:35.549
- [Byron] I hope you can
see this, Bill and Wendy.

59:35.549 --> 59:38.049
It's like a circus down there.

59:38.969 --> 59:41.439
- You know, Byron, it's easy
for us reporting this story

59:41.439 --> 59:45.151
to forget there's a very scared
little girl inside that car.

59:45.151 --> 59:46.924
We can only imagine, as
this chase continues,

59:46.924 --> 59:51.924
the horror young Natalie Voss
is experiencing right now.

59:52.103 --> 59:53.020
- Oh, shit.

59:54.124 --> 59:55.963
- Just, just hold still.

59:55.963 --> 59:56.963
- It stings.

59:58.482 --> 59:59.964
Mm!

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.556
- I don't want it to get infected.

01:00:02.556 --> 01:00:04.386
I'm so sorry about this.

01:00:04.386 --> 01:00:05.969
- As you should be.

01:00:12.712 --> 01:00:14.504
What are you doing?

01:00:14.504 --> 01:00:16.004
- You're sweating.

01:00:24.998 --> 01:00:29.039
I've never met anybody
quite like you, Jack.

01:00:29.039 --> 01:00:31.220
- I wish things were different.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.500
I'm really a pretty likable
guy when I'm not a fugitive.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.166
- I wish things were different too.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:38.862
Isn't it funny how people meet?

01:00:38.862 --> 01:00:41.582
I mean, they can come from
two totally different worlds

01:00:41.582 --> 01:00:44.749
and never even know each other exists.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:48.446
And then one day they meet and

01:00:48.446 --> 01:00:51.486
their lives are never the same.

01:00:51.486 --> 01:00:52.972
Are you married?

01:00:52.972 --> 01:00:53.805
- No.

01:00:56.003 --> 01:00:57.864
- Do you have a girlfriend?

01:00:57.864 --> 01:01:00.531
- No, I don't have a girlfriend.

01:01:02.904 --> 01:01:07.203
- And it's true that you
haven't been with a woman

01:01:07.203 --> 01:01:09.624
in a couple of years?

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:11.124
- It's true, yeah.

01:01:13.966 --> 01:01:15.118
- If all this doesn't work out,

01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:17.246
you'll go back to prison, right?

01:01:17.246 --> 01:01:18.163
- Probably.

01:01:23.043 --> 01:01:25.210
- So it's conceivable that

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:30.890
you'd never be with a
woman ever again, right?

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:31.723
- Right.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:40.712
- What are you doing?

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:43.964
- Falling in love with you.

01:01:43.964 --> 01:01:46.881
(light rock music)

01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:56.840
- Natalie, you can't, we can't do this.

01:01:59.965 --> 01:02:01.465
- I can't help it.

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:05.470
We may never have this chance again.

01:02:33.307 --> 01:02:35.890

(siren wailing)

01:04:22.753 --> 01:04:24.695
- I just figured it all out.

01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:25.873
It's just like you said.

01:04:25.873 --> 01:04:27.852
I'm your insurance policy.

01:04:27.852 --> 01:04:29.670
- What are you talking about?

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:33.095
- Well, as long as I'm your
hostage, they can't get to you.

01:04:33.095 --> 01:04:34.871
You can demand a ransom from my father,

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.855
we'll take the money, we'll escape

01:04:36.855 --> 01:04:38.810
to Mexico just like you said.

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:40.252
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:04:40.252 --> 01:04:42.228
Hold on a minute here, Patty Hearst.

01:04:42.228 --> 01:04:43.476
- What?

01:04:43.476 --> 01:04:45.862
- On second thought, maybe
Mexico ain't such a hot idea.

01:04:45.862 --> 01:04:47.532
We'll have to wait in line at the border

01:04:47.532 --> 01:04:48.970
while they check the
trunk for illegal fruit.

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:49.803
I mean, come on.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.053
- No, I'm completely serious.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.453
They'll never be able to get us.

01:04:53.453 --> 01:04:54.451
I'm your hostage.

01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:55.645
There's no way they could possibly

01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:57.040
think we're in this together.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.993
(heavy rock music)

01:04:57.993 --> 01:04:59.273
- It's getting close.

01:04:59.273 --> 01:05:00.908
It's getting real close.

01:05:00.908 --> 01:05:03.630
- [Man] Subject vehicle, red BMW,

01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:06.745
now approaching with suspect and hostage.

01:05:06.745 --> 01:05:08.504
All officers take your positions.

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.337
- Move!

01:05:09.337 --> 01:05:10.170
Come on, come on!

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:12.235
We can't have you there.

01:05:12.235 --> 01:05:13.298
- [Man] Prepare to engage suspect.

01:05:13.298 --> 01:05:15.881
(guns cocking)

01:05:19.378 --> 01:05:22.754
All emergency services remain in position.

01:05:22.754 --> 01:05:24.999
Fire, be ready with foam.

01:05:24.999 --> 01:05:26.749
Paramedics, stand by.

01:05:31.208 --> 01:05:32.295
- This could actually work.

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:34.350
- Yes, it's gonna work, it's gonna work.

01:05:34.350 --> 01:05:35.183
- All right.

01:05:35.183 --> 01:05:36.717
- I know this beautiful spot

01:05:36.717 --> 01:05:40.975
in Cabo San Lucas where
the beaches are gorgeous.

01:05:40.975 --> 01:05:43.092
God, this is so romantic.

01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:44.533
- Have you noticed that
there's no other cars

01:05:44.533 --> 01:05:46.200
on the road anymore?

01:05:47.395 --> 01:05:48.244
- Cars?

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:49.077
(percussive music)

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:49.910
- [Man] Attention!

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:54.410
Subject vehicle is 500
yards and approaching fast.

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:58.685
All personnel stand
clear of the barricade.

01:05:58.685 --> 01:05:59.563
(gasping)

01:05:59.563 --> 01:06:00.396
- Oh, my god.

01:06:00.396 --> 01:06:01.355
Strap in!

01:06:01.355 --> 01:06:02.233
- [Natalie] Oh, shit!

01:06:02.233 --> 01:06:03.757
- Strap in!

01:06:03.757 --> 01:06:04.773
Hang on!

01:06:04.773 --> 01:06:07.690
(tires screeching)

01:06:11.757 --> 01:06:13.156
Ah.

01:06:13.156 --> 01:06:16.016
Maybe this whole thing wasn't
such a hot idea after all.

01:06:16.016 --> 01:06:17.696
(sirens wailing)

01:06:17.696 --> 01:06:18.640
- This is it!

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.388
- [Byron] This is more
exciting than election night!

01:06:20.388 --> 01:06:22.179
- Box 'em in, box 'em in, box 'em in.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:23.499
- Do something!

01:06:23.499 --> 01:06:24.818
- Like what?

01:06:24.818 --> 01:06:25.696
- I don't know!

01:06:25.696 --> 01:06:26.529
Anything!

01:06:28.199 --> 01:06:29.869
(tires screeching)

01:06:29.869 --> 01:06:31.123
What are you doing?

01:06:31.123 --> 01:06:32.040
- Anything!

01:06:34.622 --> 01:06:35.622
- Holy shit!

01:06:37.539 --> 01:06:38.604
(gasping)

01:06:38.604 --> 01:06:41.521
(tires screeching)

01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:46.010
(screaming)

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:48.874
- [Byron] This is unheard-of!

01:06:48.874 --> 01:06:51.220
The surprise roadblock has backfired!

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.695
Hammond's outsmarted the cops!

01:06:52.695 --> 01:06:54.433
- Get in control out there!

01:06:54.433 --> 01:06:56.294
Stop that damn car!

01:06:56.294 --> 01:06:58.994
(heavy rock music)

01:06:58.994 --> 01:07:00.883
(tires screeching)

01:07:00.883 --> 01:07:03.550
(cars crashing)

01:07:09.302 --> 01:07:10.469
- Don't panic!

01:07:11.998 --> 01:07:13.459
- [Man] Go, go, go!

01:07:13.459 --> 01:07:16.042
(car crashing)

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:20.519
- [Byron] The tension is unbearable!

01:07:20.519 --> 01:07:21.352
- Shit!

01:07:21.352 --> 01:07:22.357
- Yes, sir!

01:07:22.357 --> 01:07:24.373
- [Byron] Stay close to your sets, folks!

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:25.206
- [Jack] Oh!

01:07:25.206 --> 01:07:26.047
- [Natalie] I'm gonna die,
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:27.203
- You're not gonna die!

01:07:27.203 --> 01:07:28.036
Relax!

01:07:28.036 --> 01:07:30.619
(car crashing)

01:07:33.497 --> 01:07:34.447
- Keep shooting!

01:07:34.447 --> 01:07:35.864
Think of my Emmy!

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:42.980
(static hissing)

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.397
- Take your stinking paws
off me, you damn dirty ape!

01:07:48.592 --> 01:07:49.425
- Monkeys.

01:07:51.019 --> 01:07:52.632
- Fix this damn thing.

01:07:52.632 --> 01:07:57.632
(heavy rock music)
(sirens wailing)

01:08:00.861 --> 01:08:01.694
- [Jack] Whoo!

01:08:01.694 --> 01:08:03.944
(laughing)

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:31.854
- [Byron] Hammond seems to be,

01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:34.060
Bill, Wendy, can you see this?

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.118
Hammond is leading the pursuit in a

01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:38.395
giant game of ring-around-the-rosy.

01:08:38.395 --> 01:08:39.754
- Jack, you anti-hero,

01:08:39.754 --> 01:08:41.639
if you're going to get away, get away now.

01:08:41.639 --> 01:08:43.020
- Bill, this is really ridiculous.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.714
It's pretty clear now that
this guy, Jack Hammond,

01:08:44.714 --> 01:08:46.540
is just toying with the police.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.140
I hope they put him away for a long time.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.977
- You are dead serious
about going with me?

01:08:51.977 --> 01:08:53.340
- Serious as a heart attack.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.140
- You are absolutely,
positively, 100% sure about this.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.559
- I have never been more sure about

01:08:57.559 --> 01:08:59.649
anything in my entire life.

01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:02.399
(sirens wailing)

01:09:05.707 --> 01:09:06.540
- We'll be fugitives.

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.337
- Sounds exciting.

01:09:08.337 --> 01:09:09.955
- You won't be Natalie Voss anymore.

01:09:09.955 --> 01:09:11.145
- Who the hell is she anyway?

01:09:11.145 --> 01:09:12.393
- I don't know, I don't know.

01:09:12.393 --> 01:09:14.095
But you're going to give
up everything for me?

01:09:14.095 --> 01:09:15.091
- Don't flatter yourself.

01:09:15.091 --> 01:09:16.975
I'm doing it for me too.

01:09:16.975 --> 01:09:18.299
- Of course you are.

01:09:18.299 --> 01:09:21.049
(sirens wailing)

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:48.532
(tires screeching)

01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:10.033
(guns cocking)
(men yelling)

01:10:12.001 --> 01:10:13.584
- [Man] This is it!

01:10:16.785 --> 01:10:19.285
- Let go of the girl, Hammond!

01:10:23.247 --> 01:10:24.814
(gun cocking)

01:10:24.814 --> 01:10:27.564
(men chattering)

01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:35.166
(dramatic music)

01:10:42.687 --> 01:10:44.029
- [Natalie] What are you doing?

01:10:44.029 --> 01:10:45.753
Let's keep going.

01:10:45.753 --> 01:10:47.310
- Look, Natalie,

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:48.393
if I had things my way,

01:10:48.393 --> 01:10:50.729
you'd be the girl I'd run
away to paradise with.

01:10:50.729 --> 01:10:52.771
- But I'm gonna be your hostage.

01:10:52.771 --> 01:10:54.521
- Natalie, it's over.

01:10:57.033 --> 01:11:00.783
I can't let you ruin
your life because of me.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:05.870
I think it's time for you to go home now.

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.703
- You can't mean that.

01:11:09.927 --> 01:11:12.128
- You know, until yesterday,

01:11:12.128 --> 01:11:14.089
the worst thing I ever did in my whole

01:11:14.089 --> 01:11:16.839
life was cheat on a biology exam.

01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:20.916
And now I'm a car thief, a kidnapper,

01:11:23.146 --> 01:11:25.396
cop-shooter, police-evader.

01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:29.750
I can't do this to you.

01:11:31.049 --> 01:11:34.216
I can't make you part of this anymore.

01:11:36.965 --> 01:11:39.132
I care about you too much.

01:11:41.273 --> 01:11:44.773
Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore.

01:11:46.211 --> 01:11:47.461
We ate the gun.

01:11:48.851 --> 01:11:51.509
- But you have the real gun.

01:11:51.509 --> 01:11:52.342
- Uh,

01:11:55.129 --> 01:11:57.296
real guns make me nervous.

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:05.491
I do better with the candy ones.

01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:07.491
- Jack, you're innocent.

01:12:09.609 --> 01:12:11.442
We can make this work.

01:12:14.108 --> 01:12:17.230
(chuckling)

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:18.891
- You, you're really something.

01:12:18.891 --> 01:12:20.058
You know that?

01:12:23.246 --> 01:12:24.079
Thank you.

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:26.651
- For what?

01:12:26.651 --> 01:12:28.708
- For believing in me.

01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:31.291
- Let the girl go now, Hammond!

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:33.350
(exhaling deeply)

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:36.689
- It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid?

01:12:36.689 --> 01:12:38.106
What say you, uh,

01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:43.521
step out of the car and walk away from me?

01:12:43.521 --> 01:12:45.346
I'll be fine.

01:12:45.346 --> 01:12:47.030
- You come with me.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.030
- You first.

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.010
I'm right behind you.

01:13:32.267 --> 01:13:35.767
(police radio chattering)

01:13:41.647 --> 01:13:43.089
- Miss Voss, Miss Voss!

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:44.146
Okay, stay down.

01:13:44.146 --> 01:13:45.291
Oh, you're a lucky girl.

01:13:45.291 --> 01:13:46.289
You're a lucky girl.

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.526
Just get behind the door there.

01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:49.291
Just get right behind the door there.

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:50.185
We will take care of him.

01:13:50.185 --> 01:13:51.169
Don't worry.

01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:53.873
Boy, I hope he tries something now.

01:13:53.873 --> 01:13:55.111
- Come on, Hammond.

01:13:55.111 --> 01:13:57.045
Just give me one reason.

01:13:57.045 --> 01:14:01.064
(dramatic piano music)

01:14:01.064 --> 01:14:02.564
- Way to go, Jack.

01:14:04.916 --> 01:14:06.194
Way to go.

01:14:06.194 --> 01:14:07.349
- Come on, Hammond!

01:14:07.349 --> 01:14:09.053
You're in a no-win situation!

01:14:09.053 --> 01:14:12.159

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.868

01:18:05.701 --> 01:18:06.840

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.718

01:18:07.718 --> 01:18:08.551

01:18:08.551 --> 01:18:09.384

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:16.370

01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:31.274

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:37.104
- I said uncuff Jack Hammond now!

01:18:37.104 --> 01:18:38.363

01:18:38.363 --> 01:18:39.683

01:18:45.557 --> 01:18:48.039
- Natalie, stop embarrassing me.

01:18:48.039 --> 01:18:51.063

brains out all over live TV.

01:18:51.063 --> 01:18:52.093
- Miss Voss, don't do it.

01:18:52.093 --> 01:18:52.926
You're confused.

01:18:52.926 --> 01:18:54.265

01:18:54.265 --> 01:18:55.931
It's very confusing.

01:18:55.931 --> 01:18:57.454

01:18:57.454 --> 01:18:59.037

01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:20.413

01:19:41.912 --> 01:19:45.069
- How do you plan to
get us out of this one?

01:19:45.069 --> 01:19:46.736
