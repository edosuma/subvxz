00:16.266 --> 00:18.268
[alarm blaring]

00:22.814 --> 00:23.732
[Michelle grunts]

00:25.984 --> 00:27.652
-Hey.
-Good morning.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.031
Did I snore?

00:31.114 --> 00:33.241
Sometimes I snore like a full animal.

00:33.324 --> 00:37.037
No. You were sleeping like a full angel.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.955
[Michelle laughs] Mm!

00:42.083 --> 00:44.627
You were talking in your sleep.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.714
-Was I?
-Mm-hmm.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.757
What was I saying?

00:49.466 --> 00:52.802
I didn't get all of it,
but you kept saying, "I'm sorry."

00:54.095 --> 00:57.849
-[laughs] That's weird.
-Yeah.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.268
You sounded kind of sad, actually.

01:00.351 --> 01:03.730
Oh, well, that's strange...

01:04.898 --> 01:06.900
'cause I feel really happy right now.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.654
Okay, I know that you're the chef,

01:12.405 --> 01:13.865
but can I make you breakfast?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.575
I make a mean frittata.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.660
-Really? How mean?
-Hmm.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.662
Hmm. Like, very mean.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.874
-Borderline cruel.
-[laughs]

01:22.957 --> 01:26.920
Well, I would love
to try your abusive frittata,

01:27.003 --> 01:29.672
but I have to get
to the farmers' market early.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.299
It's chanterelle season, and...

01:31.841 --> 01:32.801
people go batshit.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.844
I don't think you should go.
Sounds dangerous.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.097
-[laughs]
-I think you should stay here with me.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.890
-I want to.
-I want you to.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.231
You're really hard to leave.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.941
-Good.
-Ooh!

01:49.192 --> 01:51.111
I gotta go. There's, uh...

01:51.528 --> 01:54.739
There's coffee and a grinder

01:55.115 --> 01:57.992
and a French press on the counter,
if you're interested.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.160
I'm very interested.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.453
All right. Get in there.

02:02.914 --> 02:03.915
I love you.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.668
[inhales, exhales]

02:09.838 --> 02:11.506
[sniffs] Mm.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.595
[whirring]

02:17.679 --> 02:18.638
[Perez] Uh, hello.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.764
[whirring stops]

02:20.932 --> 02:21.933
Oh, hell, no.

02:22.016 --> 02:23.101
Oh, fuck.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.569
Hi! Good morning.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.363
What... This is crazy.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.740
I mean, what are the odds
that we would both know Michelle?

02:37.824 --> 02:40.410
I live here and dated her for six years,
so my odds are pretty good.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.495
Oh, yeah, those are solid odds.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.705
How do you know Michelle?

02:45.957 --> 02:47.292
Uh...

02:48.918 --> 02:49.919
Oh.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.381
-Got it.
-Yeah. She's great.

02:53.464 --> 02:54.757
-Nope.
-Okay.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.218
Do you want some coffee?

02:57.302 --> 02:59.387
-Don't offer me my own espresso.
-Okay. Sorry.

02:59.804 --> 03:01.764
Um, that's a cool shirt.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.017
It's a real statement piece.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.059
-Sweet gams, too.
-Shut up.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.061
-[cell phone vibrating]
-[Judy] Okay.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.152
-Do you need to get that?
-I need you to get out of my house.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.862
Okay. Sorry.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.783
Could you tell Michelle that--

03:21.534 --> 03:22.827
I'll just text her.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.329
[vibrating continues]

03:29.042 --> 03:29.876
What?

03:30.793 --> 03:33.171
-[beeps]
-Thirty-eight. Speeding.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.841
-[beeps]
-Forty-two. Illegal!

03:36.925 --> 03:39.385
-[beeps]
-Sixteen. That's just lame.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.846
This is a lot of work
for a stupid stop sign.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.932
Okay, this is not a lot of work, A.

03:44.724 --> 03:48.228
Pushing your enormous head out
of my vagina was a lot of work.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.187
Gross.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.104
You're telling me.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.523
And B, this is a good thing we're doing.

03:52.857 --> 03:57.403
All right, I think it's important to
contribute positively to your community,

03:57.904 --> 04:00.365
especially when you have made
some... mistakes.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.492
You sound like Judy.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.868
You know what you sound like?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.453
[mocks] "...Judy."

04:05.536 --> 04:07.163
[laughs]

04:07.830 --> 04:10.041
-Do you want a turn?
-Yeah, okay.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.125
Okay. There you go.

04:12.961 --> 04:13.878
Hey, so...

04:15.004 --> 04:16.547
what's the deal with that guy?

04:16.631 --> 04:17.548
What guy?

04:17.632 --> 04:18.591
That Ben guy.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.468
Um, he's a client.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.887
He's kind of a dork.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.430
Yes, he is.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.099
But he's a nice guy.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.851
Well, you seem chill with him.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.103
'Cause I'm chill.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.479
I'm, like, the most chill.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.648
-[tires screech]
-Hey, slow down, fuck stick!

04:34.524 --> 04:37.360
-What the fuck!
-Yeah, really chill.

04:38.111 --> 04:38.945
Look...

04:39.821 --> 04:41.447
I liked him. Ben.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.367
I kicked his ass at Cruis'n World.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.411
Well, that's 'cause you're so fast.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.412
Exactly.

04:48.121 --> 04:48.955
Prove it.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.165
Give me that thing. Prove it. Go.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.751
Come on. Go, go, go, go!
Oh, come on, Harding!

04:53.835 --> 04:55.253
-Put those knees up!
-[beeps]

04:55.336 --> 04:58.131
[laughs] Oh!

04:58.214 --> 05:00.091
-Clocking it. Clocking it.
-[beeps]

05:01.009 --> 05:02.802
-Huh. Wasn't that bad.
-All right, let me see.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.345
Oh, you think you could go faster?

05:04.429 --> 05:05.847
Honey, come on.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.933
I'm a middle-aged woman wearing heels,
with a bad back. I'm not gonna--

05:09.017 --> 05:11.185
-[laughs] Hold on, I'm not ready, hold on.
-[beeps]

05:19.652 --> 05:21.321
-Hey!
-Well, hello.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.573
Is someone doing the strut of shame?

05:23.740 --> 05:24.949
No shame in this game.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.617
Did you have fun last night?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.369
Oh, I had a great night.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.040
Oh, it was... [mumbles]

05:32.123 --> 05:34.042
Anyways. Yeah. It was good.

05:34.125 --> 05:34.959
Good.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.544
Well, you two are very cute together.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.254
-Right?
-Yep.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.672
[sighs] She's...

05:40.506 --> 05:41.466
awesome.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.886
But, um...

05:45.219 --> 05:46.179
there is one thing.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.639
-Oh, no, what's wrong with her?
-No, no, nothing's wrong with her.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.308
She is... full chef's kiss.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.268
-Okay.
-But, um...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.520
it's just that she has this roommate--

05:54.604 --> 05:55.897
Ew, she has a roommate?

05:56.397 --> 05:59.067
-That's fucking lame.
-It's just...

05:59.150 --> 06:01.361
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.487
Yeah.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.405
[clears throat] And, um...

06:05.156 --> 06:06.783
it's like a crazy convergence of, like,

06:06.866 --> 06:09.869
a handful of happenstances,
you might say--

06:09.952 --> 06:12.163
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh, must be Ben.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.164
Why is he here?

06:13.247 --> 06:14.665
I'm showing him more rentals today.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.126
Oh, I thought you looked dressed up.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.420
What? I'm not dressed up.
These are my work clothes.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.631
Yeah, you look like you're gonna <i>work!</i>

06:21.714 --> 06:23.424
You know what?
Eat my fucking butthole, Judy.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.719
I would, but I'm seeing someone now.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.721
[Jen sighs]

06:29.305 --> 06:31.432
Well, fancy meeting you here. [laughs]

06:32.141 --> 06:33.559
Oh, was I not supposed to--

06:33.643 --> 06:36.396
-No, you were. No, I was just being--
-'Cause I thought you said--

06:36.479 --> 06:38.356
-You said--
-Never mind. Just come on in.

06:38.439 --> 06:39.690
Just gotta grab the rest of my--

06:39.774 --> 06:41.359
Yeah, sorry. I just...

06:41.442 --> 06:45.029
I may be in shock a little.
Uh, I just got some news.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.156
-News?
-What kind of news?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.366
Um... [sighs]

06:48.491 --> 06:49.867
...they found Steve's car.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.286
Oh, did they?

06:52.703 --> 06:56.207
Yeah, out in the middle of nowhere.
Completely torched. Barely anything left.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.543
-Oh.
-[breathing heavily] Oh, that's awful.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.711
-Yeah, that's so awful. Um...
-Oh, my God.

07:01.212 --> 07:05.591
Because it was so torched, I mean,
how did they know that it was Steve's car?

07:05.675 --> 07:08.511
-The VIN number.
-Oh, the VIN number.

07:08.594 --> 07:10.805
-Oh, that is a miracle.
-Right.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.557
-Yeah.
-I guess it was arson,

07:12.640 --> 07:14.851
'cause whoever lit that car on fire
knew  what they were doing.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.519
-Oh, really?
-[exhales]

07:17.854 --> 07:21.149
But I mean, they don't--
they don't know who did it, right?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.942
No, not yet, but they said that

07:23.276 --> 07:25.945
they think that whoever did it was trying
to send a message, like...

07:26.028 --> 07:27.738
like a smoke signal or something?

07:28.030 --> 07:30.408
-Really?
-[stammers] Well, um...

07:30.491 --> 07:32.493
But do you think that the police
are gonna be able to find,

07:32.577 --> 07:34.662
like, evidence in the car,
you know, like...

07:35.663 --> 07:37.915
like fingerprints or DNA?

07:38.541 --> 07:40.751
I mean, I don't know.
It's too soon to tell.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.253
Let's hope they find something, you know?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.964
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Fingers crossed.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.924
[exhales] At least he wasn't in that car.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.885
My family is clinging to that.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.428
[Judy] Anyone would, yeah, sure.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.638
Anyway, I don't mean to bail on you,
I just...

07:52.722 --> 07:53.973
-No, it's...
-I gotta...

07:54.390 --> 07:55.224
It's fine.

07:55.308 --> 07:58.394
I'm sure looking for condos is not
the first thing on your mind right now.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.563
Yeah, sorry, my family is just spinning.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.064
-I bet.
-I'm sure.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.400
And somehow I got roped
into organizing a vigil,

08:04.484 --> 08:05.651
whatever that's gonna do.

08:05.735 --> 08:06.777
-Oh, my God!
-That'd be nice

08:06.861 --> 08:09.363
-for the community to get together...
-You shouldn't have to do that--

08:09.447 --> 08:10.740
-...and keep hope alive.
-Alive.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.116
It's good. Yeah.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.328
I'll be honest with you,
any hope that I do have is kind of on...

08:16.412 --> 08:17.997
life support at the moment. [sighs]

08:19.582 --> 08:23.878
[sighs] I'm sorry.
I don't mean to get all down about the--

08:23.961 --> 08:25.046
[Jen] No, it's okay.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.464
-Please. We're...
-Boys can cry.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.632
To us, especially.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.259
-Yeah, I should probably go and...
-Okay, yeah.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.179
...you know, get, uh...

08:33.262 --> 08:35.723
-vigil stuff together, whatever that is.
-[Jen] Mm-hmm.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.808
[sighs] I don't even know where to start.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.602
-Oh, it can be really simple.
-Yeah.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.521
Like a...

08:42.104 --> 08:42.939
Get some candles.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.107
-Yeah, and some flowers.
-And some hors d'oeuvres.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.026
Oh, food! [groans]

08:47.109 --> 08:50.446
I didn't even think of that. Right.
I should be writing this down.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.699
Uh, can you start over?
Where would I go to get, um...

08:54.242 --> 08:55.743
Candles, what, flowers, food?

08:55.826 --> 08:57.745
You're gonna wanna go
to the gourmet food place on Cedar.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.121
-Okay. Cedar.
-[Judy] Yeah.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.790
And then if you want flowers,

09:00.873 --> 09:02.750
I mean, I always go to Mission View,
but that's a trek.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.835
You don't go to the--
Cedar's not for flowers,

09:04.919 --> 09:07.338
-so you go to--
-No, you get flowers at a separate place

09:07.421 --> 09:09.257
because the flowers at the supermarket
are gonna die

09:09.340 --> 09:10.716
-in the first five minutes.
-Okay.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.344
[Judy] You don't need exotic flowers.
You can just get run-of-the-mill roses.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.303
-[Ben] For flowers?
-[Judy] Yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.597
And if you want candles,
make sure you get tapers.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.682
-Tapers?
-[Judy] Yeah.

09:17.765 --> 09:18.599
-T-a-p--

09:18.683 --> 09:20.560
You know what?
Why don't you let Judy and I do it?

09:22.019 --> 09:22.853
What?

09:24.188 --> 09:25.022
I mean, really?

09:25.106 --> 09:26.899
Yeah. No, we would be happy to.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.526
-Would we?
-Mm-hmm.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.823
I'm just saying, they found the car, Jen.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.366
I know. I heard him. I was there.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.410
-They're dusting it for DNA.
-I know!

09:37.493 --> 09:40.288
So I just don't think this is maybe
the smartest move we could be making.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.165
It just came out of my mouth, okay?
I couldn't, like, shove it back in there.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.626
I felt bad for him.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.211
Did you see how overwhelmed he was?

09:47.295 --> 09:50.339
I know. I did. I just...
Don't get me wrong,

09:50.423 --> 09:51.924
-I think it's a sweet gesture.
-Thank you.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.051
If you didn't kill the person
that the vigil is for.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.094
Okay, well...

09:55.720 --> 09:57.471
Ben shouldn't have to be doing it.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.183
I mean, I had to plan Ted's funeral
two days after he died,

10:01.267 --> 10:02.476
and it was fucking hell.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.564
And not to sound like
how I'm probably gonna sound right now,

10:06.647 --> 10:09.650
but maybe it's not the worst idea.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.237
I mean, who's gonna suspect that
the people planning the vigil

10:13.321 --> 10:15.781
are the reason that they're having
the vigil in the first place?

10:15.865 --> 10:18.284
-Well, it's a type of logic.
-Okay, well, fine.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.286
More importantly,
it's just a nice thing to do.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.707
I mean, you of all people should get it.
It's like a total WWJD.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.127
A "What would Judy do?"

10:28.753 --> 10:30.338
[clicks tongue] Thanks.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.841
I'm just trying to be a good person.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.179
Okay.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.473
Well, in that spirit...

10:41.599 --> 10:42.850
I'm gonna say something,

10:43.225 --> 10:47.396
and I would like you
to listen to it like I would.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.066
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:52.068 --> 10:56.072
Michelle's roommate is her ex-girlfriend.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.031
No, fuck that.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.199
-Dude.
-Sorry.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.118
-It's Perez.
-Who's Perez?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.953
-Her ex is Perez.
-Our Perez?

11:03.037 --> 11:04.246
-That Perez.
-Oh, my God.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.748
-I know.
-Oh, my God.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.708
Of all the lesbians in Laguna--

11:07.792 --> 11:11.629
I know, I didn't do it on purpose.
It just happened.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.923
-Pretty organically, actually.
-Well, I'm sorry.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.842
-Why are you sorry?
-Because that's what you would say

11:16.926 --> 11:19.178
when I tell you that
you cannot see her anymore.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.515
-Perez hates you.
-Okay, I think "hate" is a strong word.

11:22.598 --> 11:26.644
Eh, no, that's the word that matches
the feeling that she has for you.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.731
She served you with two restraining orders
in the last six months, Judy.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.734
I can't have you fucking her girlfriend
on the other side of the wall!

11:33.818 --> 11:35.403
-That's not their layout.
-Oh, Judy!

11:36.070 --> 11:37.029
I really like Michelle.

11:37.113 --> 11:39.740
She's the first person since Steve
that I can actually see myself with.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.785
She makes me feel worthy.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.370
I know. I'm sorry.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.831
But you...

11:46.914 --> 11:48.499
you just met her, you know?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.670
And we really just have
to batten down our hatches right now.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.505
I don't want to batten down my hatch.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.465
-Judy!
-[sighs]

11:56.549 --> 11:57.383
Please.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.604
[Michelle] Hey.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.314
Hi.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.650
Um, could we go somewhere?

12:15.484 --> 12:16.318
Sure.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.074
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.081
[Judy] Oh.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.208
We need to talk.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.043
Yes, we should.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.712
Um...

12:36.005 --> 12:39.049
I'm sorry if my ex was a dick
to you this morning.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.885
Oh, no, it's okay.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.094
No.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.514
No, no, no, it's not okay.
She can't treat you like that.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.476
She's just overprotective.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.271
She was, like,
trying to forbid me from seeing you.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.107
[scoffs] Well, I don't think
I'm her cup of tea, so...

12:55.649 --> 12:58.277
Yeah, I know.
She told me about the thing with the car.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.488
What-- what thing... with the-- What car?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.032
That you smashed up some car.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.074
Oh.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.161
And then she said that you were a riptide.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.206
-Hmm. Yeah.
-[scoffs]

13:11.123 --> 13:15.669
Look, she doesn't get to decide
who I spend my time with.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.129
I do.

13:17.922 --> 13:18.839
And you do.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.466
I do.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.054
[sighs] I just-- I um, can't...

13:26.138 --> 13:27.765
I can't keep spending time with you.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.309
Oh.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.895
Well, that took a turn.

13:35.898 --> 13:36.899
You know, I don't...

13:37.399 --> 13:40.778
I don't have a lot of nights
like the night we just had.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.112
I don't either.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.114
Okay, well, then if this is because
of something she said--

13:44.198 --> 13:45.366
It's not. It's...

13:49.119 --> 13:51.288
Your energy is so...

13:52.540 --> 13:53.415
beautiful...

13:54.375 --> 13:55.501
and honest.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.628
And I...

13:58.254 --> 13:59.171
[shudders]

13:59.255 --> 14:03.884
I just feel karmically like I'm not
in the right place to receive it.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.095
Okay.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.809
Well, I mean, that just sounds
like a woo-woo way of saying,

14:11.892 --> 14:13.227
"It's not you, it's me."

14:13.310 --> 14:15.729
[sighs] Well, it is me.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.233
Trust me, you don't want anything
to do with me.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.238
I'm sorry, I just can't see you anymore.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.699
I mean, I'll probably see you
walking down the hallway

14:26.782 --> 14:29.410
when you visit your mom, and I'll say hi,
but you know what I mean.

14:30.160 --> 14:30.995
Mm-hmm.

14:32.997 --> 14:33.831
I'm sorry.

14:36.792 --> 14:37.793
I'm sorry too.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.757
I'm just gonna...

14:45.092 --> 14:47.636
[Judy] I'm just gonna wash my hands...

14:49.597 --> 14:52.182
before returning to work,
'cause it's state law, so...

15:12.494 --> 15:13.329
[Jen] Hey.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.415
What do you even wear to a vigil? Huh?

15:16.957 --> 15:20.836
I think I'm going for somewhere in between
court appearance and second wedding.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.754
Sure.

15:22.796 --> 15:23.964
[Jen] Are you okay?

15:24.465 --> 15:25.299
No.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.929
-Did you talk to Michelle?
-Mm-hmm.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.598
I'm so sorry you had to do that.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.976
[sighs]
I see you're drinking your feelings.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.520
-[Judy] WWJD.
-Hmm?

15:39.396 --> 15:40.606
"What would Jen do?"

15:41.023 --> 15:41.899
Fair.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.693
Hurtful, but fair.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.613
What is all this?

15:48.072 --> 15:51.533
Oh, uh,
we're helping Ben with his vigil thing.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.285
Did they find his brother?

15:53.744 --> 15:55.245
No. No, not yet.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.122
Well, that sucks.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.334
At least with Dad,
we knew right away, right?

16:00.417 --> 16:02.795
Yeah, well, that's why we're doing it,
you know, just to...

16:03.796 --> 16:05.673
show support, pay it forward.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.510
Yeah, do good stuff,
make up for bad stuff, I got it.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.178
Yep. All that.

16:14.098 --> 16:14.932
I can't do this.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.433
Oh, Jude.

16:16.517 --> 16:20.562
I can't stand there with Steve's friends
and family and pray for his safe return.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.482
I know... I understand, okay?

16:23.565 --> 16:27.111
But don't you think it would be
a little weird if you didn't go?

16:27.194 --> 16:28.362
They won't even notice.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.116
The only time Steve's mom even remotely
cared about me was when I was pregnant.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.785
I can't face her.

16:34.868 --> 16:36.662
You don't have to, all right?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.831
I will protect you. I promise.

16:39.581 --> 16:42.001
All we have to do is show up,

16:42.584 --> 16:43.919
hand out some candles,

16:44.003 --> 16:46.505
and show the community we didn't do it.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.133
Okay? And then we will
get the hell out of there.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.051
Okay.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.053
We will fly right under the radar.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.748
-Here you go.
-Candle?

17:20.831 --> 17:21.790
Thank you.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.084
-Candle?
-Hi, here's a candle.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.419
Candle?

17:26.253 --> 17:28.130
He has a lot more friends
than I thought he did.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.965
-He's very social.
-Aww.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.550
Here you go.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.597
Take a look around.

17:37.306 --> 17:38.182
What do you see?

17:39.183 --> 17:43.520
Friends, neighbors, family
gathering to share one thing:

17:43.937 --> 17:44.772
hope.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.356
Thank you for coming.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.734
Oh, hi, Len. Candle?

Len. Hi, Len. Like a candle?

17:55.115 --> 17:55.949
Thank you.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.117
[Judy sighs]

17:57.201 --> 18:00.579
-Yeah. I think we did a pretty good job.
-Yeah, are you kidding me?

18:01.121 --> 18:03.082
Shit, I wanna go missing.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.667
-Don't say that.
-Ah, you know what I mean.

18:09.129 --> 18:10.881
-It's her.
-What?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.674
It's his mom.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.343
-Okay, just don't-- it's okay.
-[whimpering]

18:14.426 --> 18:17.221
It's okay. Deep breath. Deep breath.
I got you. I got you.

18:18.013 --> 18:18.847
Judy.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.016
-Hello, Eileen.
-Hello, Judy.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.227
You look the same. Bangs.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.313
[laughs] Yep. You look well.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.231
I'm not.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.650
Oh. I like your scarves.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.236
Benji, find me a chair, would you?

18:32.319 --> 18:33.153
[Ben] Yes, Mom.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.406
Benji told me
you helped put this together.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.035
She did, because she is the kindest person
that I know.

18:40.911 --> 18:42.246
Hey, will you go do that thing

18:42.329 --> 18:44.581
that we talked about you doing
that I can't do...

18:44.665 --> 18:46.083
-[Judy] Sorry.
-...because only you can?

18:46.625 --> 18:49.503
Hi. I'm Jen. I'm, um...

18:50.504 --> 18:51.505
I'm a friend of Ben's.

18:52.089 --> 18:53.048
Would you like a candle?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.717
I can't.
Strong smells trigger my migraines.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.011
-Oh, it's electric.
-[rattles]

18:58.137 --> 19:01.557
[Eileen] Oh, how novel. Thank you.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.475
It's so kind of everyone to turn up.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.229
I didn't have the strength
to plan this myself.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.189
You understand.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.315
Yeah, I do.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.651
Do you have any children, Jen?

19:12.734 --> 19:15.362
Uh, yeah, I-- I have two boys.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.282
Oh, just like me.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.243
Yeah, like you.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.957
Well, I pray you never have to
live through what I'm living through.

19:28.625 --> 19:29.459
Thanks.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.421
It's any mother's worst nightmare.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.594
I'm so sorry.

19:45.976 --> 19:46.852
Judy?

19:47.394 --> 19:49.855
-Oh.
-What a surprise.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.732
Howard! Hi.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.443
Wow, that's a beautiful suit.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.778
Made for me by hand in Mykonos.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.113
How special.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.908
I didn't think we'd see you here.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.703
Oh. Well, I came
to support Steve's family, of course.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.038
Hmm.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.749
Is that why you ratted Steve out?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.753
To support the family?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.515
[Jen] Oh, there he is.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.226
I found you a comfortable seat, Mom.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.518
Thank you, darling.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.270
Pleasure meeting you, Jen.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.188
Yes.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.232
You hold your boys close.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.317
I'll try.

20:40.948 --> 20:41.990
[mouths] She likes you.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.004
[chattering]

21:00.509 --> 21:02.177
[sighs]

21:02.261 --> 21:03.470
[Judy] Oh, hi.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.430
-Hi.
-How are you holding up?

21:06.223 --> 21:10.143
[sighs] I mean, it's nice to see
so many people come out.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.813
I just wish I...

21:14.022 --> 21:16.566
I don't know. I wish had a better feeling
about the whole thing.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.443
What--

21:18.986 --> 21:20.320
What's your feeling?

21:20.445 --> 21:21.530
He's my twin, Jude...

21:22.990 --> 21:25.075
and if he was out there,
I feel like I would know.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.497
-What's up? Good to see you.
-Okay.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.750
-Thank you, guys, for coming.
-[exhales] Hundred percent.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.253
Gotta have faith, man. He's out there.
Right, Judy?

21:36.837 --> 21:37.671
A hundred percent.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.507
Yeah, Steve's gonna turn up
even fucking better than before.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.175

God, he's always had the worst taste
in friends.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.723
Right?

21:48.807 --> 21:49.975
Better taste in women.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.228

-I do.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.563
Hey, girl.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.480
[Judy] Hey, girl.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.028
Sorry, girl.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.195
Thanks, girl.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.116
[chattering]

22:07.993 --> 22:09.536
-Hey, girl.
-Hey, girl.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.622
-I'm just finishing up with a client.
-Oh, okay.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.545
[indistinct chatter]

22:28.138 --> 22:29.431
[Perez] Didn't expect to see you here.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.268
Oh, hi.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.437
Well, Ben's a client, so...

22:36.563 --> 22:37.939
Didn't expect to see you here.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.608
I'm working.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.903
You'd be surprised how often
a perpetrator shows up

22:42.986 --> 22:44.154
to something like this.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.406
Really?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.559
Yeah. Sorry, have we met?

23:14.643 --> 23:17.396
Yeah. Once, in Steve's office.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.857
Oh, right,
you're one of his clients, right?

23:21.274 --> 23:22.526
Mm-hmm.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.156
How far along are you?

23:28.865 --> 23:30.909
Oh. Um...

23:31.701 --> 23:32.911
Four months.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.038
Wow.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.706
[Heidi] Yeah.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.251
Is it Steve's?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.588
Um, yeah.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.845
[crying] Sorry.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.974
This is just, like, the hardest thing
I've ever been through.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.269
[crying]

24:02.315 --> 24:03.859
Sorry.

24:05.235 --> 24:08.363
No, no, no. No, don't be sorry.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.160
I'm sorry.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.664
You know what?

24:19.124 --> 24:20.750
You got to keep hope alive, right?

24:21.543 --> 24:22.377
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:22.878 --> 24:23.712
[Heidi] Yeah.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.716
Try to stay positive, okay?

24:28.675 --> 24:29.509
[exhales]

24:30.427 --> 24:31.511
Thank you.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.317
Hey.

24:46.818 --> 24:47.652
You okay?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.404
That girl Steve was seeing...

24:49.488 --> 24:51.156
-Yeah?
-...is pregnant.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.658
-No.
-Yeah.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.368
Can we please go now?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.537
Yes, I'm so sorry, Judy. I'm so sorry.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.499
Yeah, let's just see if we can get out
of here this way.

25:00.582 --> 25:01.416
[Charlie] Hi, Mom.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.793
[Jen] Charlie, what are you doing here?

25:03.877 --> 25:06.505
I just thought I should come support Ben.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.839
Oh.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.842
That's actually very sweet,
but we were, um--

25:10.926 --> 25:12.677
-We were just leaving, so--
-We gotta go.

25:12.761 --> 25:17.390
Hi. Thank you all for coming out
for Steve tonight.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.351
-Let's try to sneak out.
-[Ben] And a very special thank you

25:19.434 --> 25:20.477
to Jen Harding and Judy Hale

25:20.560 --> 25:23.104
for organizing this beautiful,
beautiful vigil.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.316
-[crowd cheering]
-[Ben] Thank you, ladies.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.152
-No problem.
-It's no big, no big at all.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.362
[Jen sighs]

25:30.445 --> 25:34.074
So, starting today,
we have set up an anonymous tip line...

25:35.700 --> 25:37.327
with a substantial reward.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.664
Oh, they went with the reward.
I was afraid they wouldn't.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.792
And it's substantial,
so that's good news for us.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.544
-Yeah. It's great.
-[Ben] So anyone

25:45.627 --> 25:47.921
that has any information,
please come forward...

25:49.422 --> 25:50.257
and help us...

-Okay.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.306
-I'll get some wine.
-All right.

-Long time no see.
-Shit.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.967
Yeah, well, you're not gonna see me
anymore, because I told Michelle that

30:03.551 --> 30:06.221
I'm not gonna hang out with her anymore
because I respect boundaries.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.473
Do you? Because from what I've seen,

you always seem

Yes.

I'm warning you, watch yourself,

30:33.540 --> 30:34.958
Well, you know what? Good.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.753
Go ahead and watch me,
because all you're gonna see

30:38.837 --> 30:42.632
is a good fucking person trying to do
the right fucking thing all the time.

maybe that's where I go wrong,
