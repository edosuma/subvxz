00:01.034 --> 00:02.403
Previously on "Chasing Life"...

00:02.470 --> 00:05.373
I've never been in love
before. Or I hadn't, until now.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.607
I love you too.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.342
It got me thinking about your
father,

00:08.409 --> 00:10.711
how I've been repressing a lot
of anger.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.646
Really toxic stuff.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.281
I think we have to break up.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.684
- Could I stay here tonight?
- Yeah.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.419
Do your parents even know you're
here?

00:18.452 --> 00:20.254
- Not exactly.
- I've been getting along

00:20.286 --> 00:22.155
really well with April lately.
I don't want to mess it up.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.192
Are you really gonna let girl
code keep you from something?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.670
What are you thinking
about? And don't worry,

00:36.704 --> 00:39.472
there's no such thing as
flattering me too much.

00:39.506 --> 00:43.811
I'm just nervous about my
staff meeting this morning.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.679
You could've at least lied.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.481
We're finding out who our
new editor-in-chief is.

00:48.515 --> 00:50.484
What if they're a total
nightmare?

00:50.551 --> 00:53.521
Well, then I'm sure you'll
charm the pants off of him.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.356
I hear you're quite good at
that.

00:59.093 --> 01:02.662
So hey, um, my parents
do this thing every fall

01:02.695 --> 01:04.831
where they invite a bunch
of friends over to drink

01:05.064 --> 01:06.766
cider and carve pumpkins in the
backyard.

01:06.801 --> 01:09.436
Really? That's so charming.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.406
I know. It's, like, the
one genuine family tradition

01:12.439 --> 01:15.509
the Hendries actually have.
Anyway, my mom was wondering
if you were coming,

01:15.543 --> 01:17.510
because she wants to get to know
you better

01:17.578 --> 01:20.414
outside of you doing a story on
our family

01:20.448 --> 01:24.185
and those all-night vigils you
guys had over my comatose body.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.620
- I'm in. When is it?
- That's the thing. It's
tomorrow.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.224
If you can't make it,
we can just go to dinner
with them some other time.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.194
No, stop it. I would love to
come.

01:33.259 --> 01:36.764
- I love carving pumpkins.
- You'd love to come? Hm?

01:36.831 --> 01:41.701
You love carving pumpkins?
You're really throwing that word
around.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.508
- Mm! No!
- I gotta go!

01:58.218 --> 02:00.754
Listen up, everyone. I'll be
brief.

02:00.820 --> 02:04.858
As you all know, I had to make a
quick decision on a new
editor-in-chief.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.328
Luckily, there was a clear
frontrunner,

02:07.361 --> 02:10.364
a woman more than qualified
to lead the charge.

02:11.799 --> 02:16.170
Raquel, let's shatter that
glass ceiling together.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.806
Thank you, Karen.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.609
Now, some of you may
have picked up on this.

02:21.675 --> 02:26.180
But the "Post" is in trouble,
because everybody gets
their news online now,

02:26.212 --> 02:29.550
so we have to improve our online
presence in order to stay
viable.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.885
The reason the Boston
Sentinel's readership

02:31.919 --> 02:33.888
went up last quarter and ours
didn't

02:33.920 --> 02:37.258
is because they post their
news on Twitter twice as fast.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.425
We need to break news first.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.496
Now some of you who have
gotten bigger stories lately,

02:42.530 --> 02:44.632
maybe you feel like I'm not
talking to you.

02:44.664 --> 02:48.502
Just because you get one home run
doesn't mean you sit on the
bench now.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.704
Let's get to work.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.766
Well done, Raquel. You were
a real dark horse candidate.

03:19.832 --> 03:23.570
Uh. That's not a reference to your
exotic looks. That was just a
coincidence.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.407
So many things about the
sentence
you're starting are illegal.

03:26.439 --> 03:27.574
Hm.

03:28.841 --> 03:31.778
Hey, congrats.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.747
And I'm probably being paranoid,

03:33.781 --> 03:37.283
but I kind of felt like you were
addressing me with that speech.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.586
No, I was.

03:39.752 --> 03:42.889
My new position means that
I have to depend on my staff.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.658
I only succeed if they deliver,

03:44.692 --> 03:47.927
so I have to pinpoint the most
valuable players on this team,

03:47.961 --> 03:50.730
- like you.
- Thank you.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.233
Don't thank me. I'm not doing
this for you.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.235
I'm doing this for the "Post,"

03:55.269 --> 03:58.572
and you should feel flattered
that I'm being hard on you.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.407
When I first started out,

04:00.473 --> 04:02.475
Barbara Walters used to make my
life hell.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.576
But she never criticized

04:03.644 --> 04:06.013
the other girl at my level,
Laura.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.816
- You know where Laura is now?
- Where?

04:08.848 --> 04:11.284
Who the hell knows? My point is,

04:11.318 --> 04:13.887
you do not want to be someone
I have nothing to say to.

04:15.254 --> 04:17.957
Raquel, congrats again on the...

04:23.630 --> 04:26.432
- Gin.
- Pbbt!

04:26.466 --> 04:29.802
You might just have to accept
that I'm better at gin than you are.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.038
Then I might just have to dump you.

04:32.271 --> 04:34.841
- Oh-oh!
- Come on, really?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.677
Oh, sorry.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.014
I know we're a little
too adorable over here.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.581
No, I just got a notice

04:41.615 --> 04:43.050
they're raising the rent again

04:43.283 --> 04:45.386
on the storage unit where
we keep Thomas' stuff.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.355
Thomas was Sara's late husband.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.389
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.456
Oh, thank you.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.459
Is there any good reason
to keep it?

04:52.492 --> 04:53.593
What's even in there?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.295
I don't actually know.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.396
I've never been in it.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.499
By the time we moved all of his
stuff in

04:58.531 --> 04:59.533
from the Florida house,

04:59.566 --> 05:01.935
I knew what he was actually
using that place for.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.571
And I knew going through all
that stuff would just upset me.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.975
Thomas had a secret family down
in Florida.

05:09.375 --> 05:13.079
The contents of that double
life are in this locker.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.480
Got it.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.016
Maybe it's time, huh?

05:16.050 --> 05:17.483
Yeah, just stop

05:17.518 --> 05:19.052
pissing money away.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.521
That's... that's just

05:20.553 --> 05:22.456
letting the terrorists win.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.925
- Was Thomas also a terrorist?
- No.

05:24.957 --> 05:29.596
Not that we know of. I guess she'll
find out when she goes
down to the locker.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.367
Why don't I go with you?

05:33.433 --> 05:36.569
Whatever we find, it'll be fine.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.670
Thank you, Mom.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.773
Yeah, I'm a little nervous.

05:39.807 --> 05:42.776
Don't be. What's the worst that
can happen?

05:44.377 --> 05:47.581
We find out he has
another illegitimate child?

05:51.084 --> 05:54.120
Know what? I'm sorry, but
I was not the immature one.

05:54.353 --> 05:55.689
Okay? I was raised by a single
mother.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.425
I've lived all over the
world. I'm way more cultured.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.595
What, he thinks he's mature
because he brews his own beer

06:01.627 --> 06:04.398
with tools from his dad's
chemistry lab? Please.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.533
You thought he was lame
when you met him, right, Leo?

06:07.834 --> 06:10.370
Don't worry, it's not
gonna be one of those things

06:10.403 --> 06:12.872
where you trash him and we
end up getting back together.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.007
You know, like that time
when you guys had your fight,

06:15.041 --> 06:16.976
I said all that stuff about how
you sucked.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.879
And now you guys are back
together and all over each other

06:18.911 --> 06:21.581
- and it's just so awkward!
- Sorry. We're just...

06:21.615 --> 06:23.684
Happy. Yeah, you've mentioned.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.053
Oh, when did this get empty?

06:27.120 --> 06:31.658
Natalie, can we get four
more beers... for Beth?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.393
No microbrews, okay?

06:33.459 --> 06:36.028
I don't want anything made by
a dude with a beard in Vermont.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.031
She wants a watery,
mass-produced beer

06:38.064 --> 06:39.800
that advertises during the Super
Bowl.

06:39.832 --> 06:43.002
- Got it.
- Oh, and I remembered my keys
this time,

06:43.069 --> 06:46.740
so I don't lock myself out.
Sorry I left you a million
messages last night.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.942
- Where were you?
- Uh, I just had to run some
errands.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.579
You know, if you're hooking up
with someone, you can just say
it.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.548
I'm not that fragile.
Just cause I don't know

06:54.615 --> 06:56.983
when I'm ever gonna hook
up with anyone ever again.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.887
I'm gonna go get you those
beers.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.689
- It's been a rough week.
- Mm-hmm.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.591
I bet you could use a break
right now, huh?

07:05.658 --> 07:08.661
- Yeah.
- Like a tropical vacation

07:08.728 --> 07:13.800
where we lie on beach all day?
Except for when we're snorkeling
or eating fried food.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.435
I mean, yeah.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.603
Great, let's just do that then.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.139
I found a ridiculous deal
online,

07:20.173 --> 07:22.042
and I'm taking you to
Bermuda for the weekend,

07:22.074 --> 07:25.012
- two weeks from Friday.
- Oh my God! Are you serious?

07:25.045 --> 07:27.447
Oh my God!

07:27.480 --> 07:31.084
Okay. Okay, so I know you're
really into her and you "love
her,"

07:31.151 --> 07:35.088
and all that stuff, but I might
need to make this woman my wife.

07:35.988 --> 07:38.558
- I am cool with that.
- Okay, good.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.161
Uh...

07:42.228 --> 07:46.066
Sorry. I'm just trying
to get an early start.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.735
Raquel has been laying on the
pressure for us to break more
stories,

07:48.769 --> 07:50.670
and I want to be done by a
reasonable hour,

07:50.737 --> 07:54.040
because Leo invited me to this
thing with his family tonight.

07:54.106 --> 07:57.877
I want to get to know them
better, now that Leo and I
are...

07:57.911 --> 07:59.913
In love?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.249
- Where's Brenna?
- Upstairs.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.718
She just texted me she'll be
right down.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.589
- She texted her from upstairs?
- Are they back together?

08:10.690 --> 08:13.492
- Hi.
- Hi. Missed you.

08:13.526 --> 08:17.064
- She missed her?
- They were a whole floor apart.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.132
So, Greer, have you spoken
to your parents lately?

08:20.167 --> 08:23.036
- Oh, no, did they call you or
something?
- No no no.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.738
I just wondered if they'd been
in contact with you separately.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.542
Mom, that's... Not really our
business.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.276
Actually, it is our business.

08:30.543 --> 08:32.745
I mean, even though they
know that you're staying here

08:32.812 --> 08:34.780
and they seem to be okay with
it, I'd like to know that there's

08:34.847 --> 08:37.283
- some resolution in sight.
- I know. I'm sorry.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.086
I've only spoken to them
once since the benefit.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.024
But my dad did ask me to meet
with him for coffee after
school.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.859
I don't know what about, but...

08:45.893 --> 08:47.293
Well, it sounds like he's trying
to open up

08:47.527 --> 08:49.229
the lines of communication.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.899
Please tell him he can call me
any time.

08:51.965 --> 08:56.302
I don't really feel comfortable
with this big divide
between the families.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.672
- That sounds so shakespearean.
- Right?

08:58.739 --> 09:02.075
"Juliet and Juliet."

09:02.142 --> 09:04.977
You guys are lame.

09:05.678 --> 09:07.681
Good work. Keep it up.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.316
You got it, Ra...

09:09.982 --> 09:10.951
Quel.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.919
Morning.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.254
- Raquel just touched me.
- And?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.124
And sleeping here finally paid
off.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.591
Remember that boring assignment

09:18.625 --> 09:20.192
about the prison guard
shortage at the state pen?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.062
- Mm-hm.
- Not so boring anymore.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.163
An inmate escaped briefly
in the middle of the night,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.198
and guess who broke the story?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.201
- Look who's Laura now.
- Huh?

09:29.269 --> 09:31.304
The girl from Raquel's
Barbara Walters story.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.905
I used to be her, but now I'm
not.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.740
But I could be again
if I don't keep this up.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.947
Well, I'm happy for you. You've
been working super hard lately.

09:40.647 --> 09:43.317
Thank you. Thanks. You too! I
mean, you were right there with
me,

09:43.350 --> 09:45.217
working all through the night
on...

09:45.251 --> 09:47.153
No, you weren't.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.331
I just wanted to say
that I know it looks bad

09:58.365 --> 09:59.633
that Danny broke a story...

09:59.665 --> 10:01.969
It's not about how it looks.
It's about what it means.

10:02.001 --> 10:03.736
What are you talking about?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.140
When I met you, you
were all about your work,

10:08.174 --> 10:10.009
and then you took that leave.

10:10.043 --> 10:14.014
And when you came back, you
seemed a little different.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.616
I thought it might just be
the haircut, but it's you.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.287
I'm getting the sense that
you've changed.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.289
- No, I haven't.
- How late were you here last
night?

10:23.322 --> 10:26.994
Last night was an exception.
My best friend's going through
this breakup...

10:27.027 --> 10:28.794
See? You got soft.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.130
Old April would have been here.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.834
Did old April even have a best
friend?

10:33.866 --> 10:36.970
- Yeah, I've known Beth for...
- Whatever.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.304
You would have blown her off
before

10:38.337 --> 10:40.407
and worked late to impress your
new boss.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.711
Look...

10:46.078 --> 10:48.914
You have control over your own
success.

10:49.048 --> 10:52.686
What is it worth to you?
What's it worth giving up?

10:53.419 --> 10:57.124
Trust me, I had to make
all of those tough calls.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.427
In another life, I'd be
married with a picket fence.

11:00.659 --> 11:03.230
But I walked away from that
fence, proudly.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.966
- Now, look at me.
- I want that kind of success,
too.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.870
- I can be old April again. I
promise.
- I don't need promises.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.740
- I need headlines.
- You're gonna get them.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.816
You're typing a lot.

11:24.216 --> 11:25.418
So are you.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.421
I know. It's like the
minute I broke the seal

11:27.453 --> 11:29.389
with the state pen story,
I've been a machine.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.357
I guess it really is about
having the right mentor.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.025
I'm really glad Raquel
and I are at a place where

11:33.092 --> 11:34.427
she can see me as someone she
can trust...

11:34.693 --> 11:36.962
oh my God, Danny, it
was one story. Calm down.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.971
This chair is actually pretty
comfortable.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.972
You gotta give her credit for
that.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.476
- You think Olivia bought it for
him?
- Look at this material.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.212
Women like us don't buy prints
like this.

11:53.279 --> 11:57.283
Thank you for being a little
catty about my husband's
mistress.

11:58.784 --> 12:01.955
Oh God! What's in here?

12:02.788 --> 12:06.426
A steel box filled with guns.

12:07.159 --> 12:11.398
- Hundred dollar bills.
- Pure heroin.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.903
- Or books.
- Oh, this family.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.940
Even when we have secret
lives, we're boring.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.109
"The Lord of the Rings" boxed
set.

12:22.142 --> 12:26.480
- You know what this means?
- Thomas had a hobbit fetish.

12:26.745 --> 12:29.816
- Mom, these were George's.
- Oh.

12:30.216 --> 12:31.951
You gonna tell him you have
them?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.090
I'm sure he doesn't need them
anymore.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.493
I don't want him to get
the wrong impression.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.897
- Have you two not spoken since
he moved?
- We haven't.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.465
We made a clean break.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.466
I've moved on. I'd like
to think he has too.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.803
I just don't want to risk
things getting messy again.

12:51.770 --> 12:55.475
"Good night moon" and
"where the wild things are."

12:56.342 --> 12:59.778
Oh. These are inscribed,

12:59.812 --> 13:01.881
"from Thomas, to Natalie."

13:02.816 --> 13:06.086
- I should call her, shouldn't
I?
- Yes, you should.

13:06.886 --> 13:10.389
Well, there's someone I can
call without any surprises.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.225
If I call Natalie, I know
exactly what I'm going to get:
Hostility.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.327
Of course, I'd prefer the
exclusive,

13:15.361 --> 13:18.398
so I'll have to get back to you
on whether or not we can
run the story if...

13:18.431 --> 13:21.301
Oh, you can give us the
exclusive?

13:21.868 --> 13:24.437
Wow! Great! Thank you.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.207
- Can you keep it down?
- Just wrapping up here.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.809
Sorry, where were we?

13:31.043 --> 13:33.446
That would be perfect.

13:34.447 --> 13:37.317
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.451
Sounds perfect.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.389
Uh-huh. Awesome.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.208
We're getting really good at
that.

14:02.841 --> 14:06.413
Mm. We need to work on your
definition of mood music.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.381
This music is not about mood.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.384
It's about having a
roommate and not wanting

14:11.418 --> 14:13.253
to make him part of this
experience...

14:13.320 --> 14:15.322
I mean, unless you're into that.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.326
Mm. Not gonna say I never like
an audience,

14:19.392 --> 14:22.962
but I'm kinda enjoying this
whole one-on-one thing right
now.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.597
Oh.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.902
Bad decisions are always the
most fun, huh?

14:28.934 --> 14:30.971
- What do you mean, bad
decisions?
- Don't worry.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.340
I'm not saying I'm gonna stop
doing this.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.174
I'm just saying it's a
little shady. Whatever.

14:35.207 --> 14:39.278
Shady? Why is it shady? Because
of April?

14:39.346 --> 14:42.481
We talked about this. We're
not doing anything wrong.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.519
We were just waiting to tell her
until we knew that this was gonna
be a thing.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.556
Well, now that we know it is,
maybe we should just tell her.

14:49.588 --> 14:52.292
The longer we keep it a secret,
the weirder it's gonna be.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.527
Okay. So, which one of
us is gonna tell her?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.429
- How about whoever sees her
first?
- Sure.

14:57.496 --> 15:00.267
Great. Then let's rehearse what
you're gonna say if it's you.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.067
I'm April. Go.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.971
Okay.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.643
"Hey, April. I just want to
start by saying

15:09.676 --> 15:12.044
that what I am about to
tell you is not a big deal,

15:12.111 --> 15:13.480
so don't freak out."

15:13.513 --> 15:16.081
That's the worst possible way to
start.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.652
You need to be more
casual about it. Try again.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.023
"Hey, April.

15:23.222 --> 15:26.025
You know how sometimes you can't
help who you're attracted to?

15:26.058 --> 15:28.094
It's just kind of like this
physical thing you can't stop..."

15:28.161 --> 15:29.995
- You suck at this!
- I'm kidding!

15:30.062 --> 15:33.332
I'm not. Seriously, I don't want
you to put your foot in your
mouth

15:33.365 --> 15:35.302
and make this a bigger
deal than it has to be.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.238
I'll handle this.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.681
They're getting divorced?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.649
My dad used the word
"separating," but yeah.

15:50.716 --> 15:54.553
It seems pretty final. He's
moving to our Nantucket house.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.389
So now you have to live with
your mom?

15:57.456 --> 16:00.326
But she's the one who
starts all the fights.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.197
- Are you sure that's what
you...
- Actually, my dad asked me

16:04.230 --> 16:06.131
if I wanted to move in with him.

16:06.198 --> 16:09.469
Oh, so now he cares about
having quality time with you?

16:09.535 --> 16:13.440
How could you even live on
Nantucket?
How would you get to school?

16:13.505 --> 16:15.642
Um, I'd go to a school there.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.213
Well, do you really think that
moving
away right now is the best idea,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.149
with everything that you're
going through?

16:23.216 --> 16:27.553
I can't live with my mom, and
I can't say no to both of them.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.724
- What if you could stay here?
- Like, move in?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.426
Yeah. I mean, until graduation.

16:34.193 --> 16:36.462
You just shouldn't have
to uproot your whole life

16:36.495 --> 16:39.298
for the last year and a half
of high school because of this.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.067
I'm asking my mom if you can
move in.

16:44.403 --> 16:48.207
Thank you... For caring so much.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.044
Oh, I don't. I just need you to
stay nearby, so we can keep
hooking up.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.179
Oh, that's what I meant by
"caring."

16:59.018 --> 17:01.086
What? Your exclusive? I heard.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.523
No, I just wanted to say I think
that Lou Bianco story's a dead
end.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.559
- What are you talking about?
- Your new story about the mafia
boss

17:07.594 --> 17:09.362
who's going to prison for
bribing the congressman.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.196
I just started working on that.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.632
How did you...

17:12.699 --> 17:14.567
Did you seriously just
hack into my wordpress

17:14.601 --> 17:17.136
while I was getting coffee for
both of us?

17:18.505 --> 17:21.473
Yeah, sorry, I didn't realize
you were getting some for me
too.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.509
Yeah, because I felt
bad about what a bitchy

17:23.576 --> 17:25.211
thing I said earlier about your
story.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.512
Whatever.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.720
- Really? You just did that?
- Yup. Mm-hmm.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.154
Wow, dude.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.810
- Heading home?
- No, I've got a date tonight.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.578
And you can't judge me
for leaving before you

17:59.612 --> 18:01.213
because you have your bag, too.

18:03.715 --> 18:06.419
How's your piece on the
construction at the train
station?

18:06.452 --> 18:09.489
Fine. You know, it's... trains.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.157
How's your mafia dude?

18:12.491 --> 18:15.862
I'm trying to get an in to get a
quote or something before
they lock him up,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.730
but he's been hiding out. I
don't know.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.767
Oh!

18:20.834 --> 18:25.104
There is my Lou Bianco alert
now. I guess there's some new...

18:25.171 --> 18:26.638
Why did your alert just go off?

18:26.705 --> 18:29.509
- It's the train station.
- Are you... ?

18:29.576 --> 18:31.877
Seriously? Are you
trying to steal my story?

18:32.144 --> 18:33.512
- Look...
- What happened to our pact?

18:33.579 --> 18:36.249
No hijacking each other's
stories! Those were the rules!

18:36.316 --> 18:37.584
The rules changed.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.685
You heard Raquel. It's
every man for himself now!

18:39.719 --> 18:42.121
- Especially now that you don't
have...
- Cancer?

18:42.154 --> 18:45.191
I was going to say "the upper
hand." But yeah, that too.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.561
Go ahead.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.131
You don't want to miss your
date.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.467
That's okay. You go ahead.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.302
Actually, I think I'm gonna
go upstairs and keep working.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.673
Hm. Good. So am I.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.477
Crap.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.518
I'm sorry. I really wanted to
spend time with your family
tonight.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.555
Thank you for understanding.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.326
Thanks, that's so nice.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.628
Oh, come on, you know I do, too.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.663
You're really gonna make me say
it?

19:25.597 --> 19:27.432
I love you too. Okay, bye.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.237
It's funny. When you said
you were coming back up here
to keep working,

19:31.270 --> 19:34.273
I didn't realize that was code
for you calling your boyfriend
to play kissy face.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.875
You have headphones.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.213
Hey, Mom! How was your day?

19:41.247 --> 19:44.384
- What's all this?
- Don't worry. I didn't help at
all,

19:44.450 --> 19:46.451
so this will be edible.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.954
I thought that we could
have a nice dinner together.

19:49.221 --> 19:53.226
That's so sweet. Are we waiting
for Greer?

19:53.259 --> 19:57.363
No, she has a tennis match.
She won't be home until late.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.633
Actually, um...

20:01.233 --> 20:02.835
I thought this might be a good
time

20:02.868 --> 20:04.503
to ask you something about her.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.707
- Sure. Is everything okay?
- No.

20:07.773 --> 20:11.277
Is she cheating on you?
Already? I'll cut her.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.479
No, everything is fine between
us.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.949
Just her parents are getting
divorced.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.917
Oh. Is she taking it hard?

20:18.951 --> 20:23.423
Well, yeah, she basically
doesn't have a home anymore.

20:23.489 --> 20:27.993
I mean, her only options are
living with her mom,
who she can't stand,

20:28.227 --> 20:31.297
or moving to Nantucket with her
dad.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.665
But she's really happy here.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.236
So if she could just stay
here until graduation...

20:37.302 --> 20:40.839
Graduation is in a year and a
half.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.710
I know. It's not even that long,
right?

20:43.742 --> 20:46.813
Brenna... I... I feel like I'm
already

20:46.846 --> 20:49.548
coming between Greer
and her parents as it is,

20:49.615 --> 20:52.018
and we have a lot going on
around here.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.320
Do we? April's health is fine
now.

20:55.387 --> 20:58.891
It's a lot to think about, even
if her parents agreed to it.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.792
But you'll think about it?

21:03.695 --> 21:05.698
Yes. I'll think about it.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.980
- Taking off?
- Yeah.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.916
I am so tired, I can't even
focus.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.920
Okay, well, I'll let you know
how it goes with the Bianco
story,

21:27.987 --> 21:31.457
- since you need to sleep.
- That'd be great. Thank you.

21:31.523 --> 21:34.292
I guess it was just... Too hard
for me.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.301
Guess it's for the best. Looks like
someone beat both of us
to the story.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.404
Some delivery guy from a liquor
store

21:45.438 --> 21:46.939
leaked a new photo of
Bianco at his home tonight.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.441
Guess that's where he's been
hiding.

21:48.508 --> 21:52.310
Hm. Yeah? Who... uh, who got the
story?

21:52.377 --> 21:54.413
The "Post."

21:55.347 --> 21:57.083
- That's us.
- I was just wondering.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.917
Because if a delivery guy leaked
the photo,

21:58.951 --> 22:01.586
that must mean that somebody
sent Mr. Bianco a delivery.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.954
Maybe the reporter who did that
piece

22:02.989 --> 22:05.490
on the Dorchester Wine Mart's
liquor license last year,

22:05.525 --> 22:08.428
and remembered them saying that
they delivered to a ton of guys
in the mob.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.897
Wow. Thanks for making me stay
late.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.032
Sometimes my best ideas come at
night.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.969
- Great.
- Oh, come on. You beat me
yesterday.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.604
- I was cool with it.
- Congratulations.

22:18.637 --> 22:20.440
You had to be the bigger person
for once,

22:20.472 --> 22:23.409
because that was that the only
time you didn't get to be the
star.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.680
Even though this is, like, all I
want...

22:27.747 --> 22:30.482
- In life.
- So do I.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.684
Just because I don't, like,
sleep here

22:32.719 --> 22:34.653
and try and steal your stories
doesn't mean I don't want...

22:34.721 --> 22:36.388
Never mind. I'm...

22:36.422 --> 22:37.757
I'm just tired.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.792
Congratulations.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.768
Yeah?

22:49.367 --> 22:52.438
- Mind if I brush my teeth?
- Go for it.

22:56.476 --> 23:00.913
April, was I dreaming or were you
still awake when it was dark out?

23:00.946 --> 23:05.050
Yeah, sorry if I woke you up.
Work has been getting crazy.

23:05.084 --> 23:09.689
I feel like I always need to be
awake to check every device
I own for news.

23:10.056 --> 23:14.093
- So how was your match?
- We got destroyed.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.695
Nothing like getting your ass
kicked by a girl named Trevor.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.132
- Ouch.
- But my dad came to watch.

23:19.397 --> 23:21.467
- That's so sweet.
- Oh my God, really?

23:22.167 --> 23:26.404
It was nice of him to try.
I mean, at least
he's putting in an effort.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.574
Yeah, it's about time.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.544
He is really pushing
the school in Nantucket.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.947
Does he realize that you'd have
to live on a deserted island?

23:35.882 --> 23:38.550
I told my mom about you maybe
moving in,

23:38.584 --> 23:41.686
- and she's thinking about it.
- Great.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.463
It sucks that she has to choose
like that.

23:51.530 --> 23:53.633
Whatever. It's not even a
question.

23:53.699 --> 23:57.002
I'm not letting her
live with her parents,
not that she ever would.

23:57.068 --> 24:00.807
She didn't seem totally closed
off to living with her dad.

24:00.839 --> 24:03.875
Wow. Really subtle.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.912
So you don't want Greer to live
here.

24:05.944 --> 24:08.647
I don't have an agenda. I like
Greer.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.750
I'm just saying she
seemed open to the idea.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.953
I know you don't want to lose
her, but if this is what she
wants,

24:14.987 --> 24:17.056
I hope you would make
that sacrifice for her.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.791
It's not what she wants.

24:24.029 --> 24:27.532
- I got him that for his
birthday.
- Hey!

24:28.733 --> 24:29.935
I'm glad you came.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.039
Yeah, I just figured there might
be something in here I could
sell.

24:34.906 --> 24:38.743
I don't know about that,
but I think there might be
some things of sentimental value.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.814
- I was kidding.
- Oh.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.153
You can just come back in,
like, an hour if you want.

24:47.185 --> 24:48.988
I don't think I need more time
than that.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.757
I don't mind staying.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.794
What, are you worried
I'm gonna steal something?

24:54.861 --> 24:58.597
No. No, not at all.

25:02.902 --> 25:07.105
I just... I thought you
might want some company.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.911
This has got to be intense for you,
and memories are bound to come up.

25:11.943 --> 25:14.747
And so for whatever it's worth,

25:14.779 --> 25:17.549
as you go through all of this

25:17.583 --> 25:21.287
and work to find your own
closure about your dad,

25:21.554 --> 25:23.221
I could be here for you.

25:26.291 --> 25:29.095
Well, now I know what Brenna
means

25:29.127 --> 25:33.231
when she says having a
therapist for a mom is
different.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.734
- Sorry, I just tend to...
- Not "bad" different.

25:35.768 --> 25:39.771
I just mean y'all are highly
functional.

25:42.107 --> 25:44.644
I'm not always so functional.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.881
I guess it's just gonna take
some time

25:48.948 --> 25:50.682
for all of this to feel normal.

25:52.183 --> 25:56.721
Or maybe if we just start acting
like it's normal now, it will
be.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.157
- Usually works.
- Does it?

26:00.026 --> 26:01.861
Only one way to find out.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.944
Hey, Bren, can I talk to you for
a minute?

26:19.010 --> 26:21.646
Yeah, did you make up
your mind yet about Greer?

26:21.681 --> 26:23.348
- No no, not yet.
- Mom.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.684
No, honey, this is about
something else.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.186
Dr. Hamburg called me
today and asked if I thought

26:28.220 --> 26:30.056
you'd be willing to go in and
talk to her.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.124
- About what?
- It's nothing to be concerned
about.

26:32.157 --> 26:34.226
She just has a question for you.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.864
I'm having a panic attack here.

26:38.897 --> 26:41.800
The only place that sells the
buttons Jaclyn wants
is on the north shore,

26:41.866 --> 26:43.301
and you know the only way
to get to the north shore

26:43.336 --> 26:44.804
without a car is a three-hour
bus ride.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.338
Guess who gets carsick on the
bus?

26:46.372 --> 26:48.307
Like, to the point of vomit.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.076
- Okay, just take a deep breath.
- I'm trying.

26:51.143 --> 26:54.246
I just walked into this
nail place that had a sign
out the front saying "relaxing."

26:54.313 --> 26:56.281
And guess what? It's not.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.183
I really wish I could meet you,

26:58.217 --> 27:01.354
but now that Raquel is my boss
it's like...

27:01.386 --> 27:04.323
Oh yeah. No no no, it's fine, I
get it.

27:04.390 --> 27:08.361
Think about Bermuda.
Imagine those weird little foot
baths are warm ocean waters.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.797
And visualize the coconuts
we're gonna be sipping from

27:11.864 --> 27:14.366
and the strange men
you'll be making out with.

27:15.201 --> 27:18.136
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

27:18.837 --> 27:21.207
I really don't want you
to be alone right now.

27:21.272 --> 27:23.409
Is there anyone else you can
call?

27:25.211 --> 27:26.711
I don't know why I'm having

27:26.746 --> 27:28.646
such an emotional reaction to
this,

27:28.681 --> 27:32.317
but whatever. I feel
calmer just being here.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.688
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Happy to help.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.357
You know, I've never felt this
sad about a breakup before.

27:39.392 --> 27:44.096
- Is that a sign that it was a
mistake?
- No. No.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.998
He bailed on you because he was
scared

27:46.031 --> 27:48.134
that you were gonna bail
on him eventually, right?

27:48.166 --> 27:50.135
Yeah, pretty much.

27:51.737 --> 27:54.807
Well, then he was coming from
a place of fear... in life.

27:54.839 --> 27:58.344
You know what?
Can I actually get some
of that organic sugar scrub?

27:58.376 --> 28:02.314
- It looks good.
- Graham is kind of a paranoid
guy.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.316
Right. He's a wuss.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.987
And you... you're the kind of
person that has lived in, what,

28:08.019 --> 28:10.423
- like three continents?
- Four.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.825
Four. So...

28:12.857 --> 28:14.460
This dude's not for you.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.163
Ah! Oh!

28:17.430 --> 28:20.833
Excuse me, is it too late to change
my mind about the shoulder rub?

28:24.804 --> 28:27.239
- You okay, Brenna?
- Yeah.

28:27.906 --> 28:30.108
Yeah, I just wasn't expecting
this.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.943
We still need to run some
more tests to make sure

28:31.977 --> 28:34.313
you're the best possible match
for this specific patient,

28:34.380 --> 28:37.348
but we only do that if you agree
to go through the whole process.

28:37.415 --> 28:39.919
- Who's the patient?
- I actually don't know.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.886
The donation process is
anonymous.

28:41.953 --> 28:44.190
But if they're reaching out to
you, somebody who's under
eighteen,

28:44.256 --> 28:46.258
it sounds like they need
a bone marrow transplant

28:46.291 --> 28:48.727
and you're probably their only
hope.

28:49.260 --> 28:50.462
So I could...

28:50.729 --> 28:53.798
- Save their life?
- Quite possibly.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.402
Then I'm in.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.137
Why don't you take the
night to think about it?

28:59.505 --> 29:01.807
- Do you need to know right now?
- Not at all.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.909
I'm seeing April tomorrow
for some routine blood work,

29:03.942 --> 29:05.743
so you can give her your final
decision

29:05.778 --> 29:07.313
and she can pass the message on
to me.

29:07.346 --> 29:10.148
In the meantime, just do some
more reading about the process.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.518
It's still a very big decision.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.887
All the time that you'll
have to devote to the process,

29:15.954 --> 29:17.423
the tests leading up to it...

29:17.490 --> 29:20.392
it's a big sacrifice for
somebody your age.

29:20.459 --> 29:25.263
Enduring some pain
to help somebody get what they need
is not an easy decision.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.271
Um...

29:37.276 --> 29:41.247
- Okay, hilarious, Danny.
Where...
- Danny?

29:41.980 --> 29:45.151
Hey! Oh my God. What are you
doing here?

29:45.217 --> 29:48.554
I thought you might be working
late, so I brought you some
crumbs

29:48.820 --> 29:52.157
- and chowder.
- Thank you. You didn't have to
do that.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.894
Um, are you wearing nail polish?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.163
Oh, well, yeah. Anything
to make Beth not cry.

29:58.230 --> 30:02.201
Thank you so much for
taking care of her for me.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.303
I feel terrible I couldn't do it
myself,

30:04.336 --> 30:07.173
especially 'cause today has been
a bust

30:07.205 --> 30:09.340
and I'm supposed to go meet
Natalie for drinks tonight,

30:09.375 --> 30:11.109
but I'm gonna have to bail.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.112
I can't leave until I break a
story.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.080
- Why?
- Because Danny has been

30:16.115 --> 30:19.084
stalking every fire and
police station in town.

30:19.117 --> 30:22.320
- I'm sure he has something by now.
- Okay, so he gets more stories
today.

30:22.387 --> 30:24.390
Tomorrow's a new day
with new stories, right?

30:24.589 --> 30:27.559
Yeah, but today we're even,
so tomorrow he'll be ahead.

30:28.227 --> 30:31.462
Oh... man. That sounds intense.

30:31.529 --> 30:35.000
Having to win every single
day. It's exhausting.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.104
Well, I'll let you get back to
it.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.339
- Mwah!
- Thank you.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.582
I've been staring at
these for far way too long.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.351
- All the ugly stuff is starting
to look cute.
- Agreed.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.854
I just put a necklace with
angel wings in my shopping cart.

30:55.921 --> 31:00.259
Take it out immediately. And
then we're gonna check out,
okay?

31:00.326 --> 31:04.496
On the count of three. One,
two...

31:04.563 --> 31:07.432
Wait. Should I put your
place as my mailing address?

31:07.499 --> 31:09.401
Yeah. Sure.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.973
It's so weird that we don't have

31:15.039 --> 31:17.542
that much time at home before we
graduate.

31:17.609 --> 31:21.046
Like, next year may be the
last year you're living here.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.549
- Yeah.
- And I guess it would have been

31:24.583 --> 31:27.019
my last year at my place.

31:28.319 --> 31:32.156
But, uh, I'm not gonna live
with my parents anymore.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.626
Ever.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.096
But it's okay.

31:38.631 --> 31:41.165
It's gonna be fun.
We're already having fun.

31:45.436 --> 31:47.338
Hey, can I tell you something?

31:49.275 --> 31:52.978
I... I didn't know how
to bring this up before,

31:53.011 --> 31:57.383
but my mom actually said no...

31:57.449 --> 31:59.484
About you moving in for real.

31:59.550 --> 32:02.221
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

32:04.088 --> 32:07.259
I don't know. I just
didn't want to upset you.

32:08.961 --> 32:12.163
- Are you mad?
- No, not at all.

32:12.196 --> 32:16.234
It was a lot to ask.
I'll be fine with my dad.

32:17.568 --> 32:20.638
Yeah, totally.

32:36.689 --> 32:39.357
- Where are you off to?
- Home.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.526
It's only 7:30.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.961
Yep, I'm gonna meet up with my
half-sister.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.630
But did you see I broke a big
story today?

32:44.663 --> 32:48.534
- Mm-hmm. And Danny broke three.
- That's good for him,

32:48.567 --> 32:51.170
and good for the "Post."
You have a great night.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.704
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:59.278 --> 33:01.512
Oh. There you are.

33:01.547 --> 33:05.017
I've got to show you this
funny video that Sam sent me.

33:05.049 --> 33:08.554
It's this turtle who pokes
his head out of his shell

33:08.586 --> 33:10.989
every time Jay-Z says the
b-word.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.460
Oh, you don't even know
who Jay-Z is, do you?

33:14.492 --> 33:17.730
God, give me some credit, Mom.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.498
Here. Show me.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.369
Why are you looking at
flights to Cleveland?

33:24.435 --> 33:27.538
Oh, well, there's a conference
on the psychology of illness.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.607
George is giving a talk.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.544
So you got in touch
with him about the books?

33:33.010 --> 33:37.082
I just decided to act like things
were normal and hope they would be.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.585
- Did it work?
- I think so.

33:39.617 --> 33:42.520
We had a really nice
conversation.

33:42.554 --> 33:46.325
It just all felt like it did
before things got so
complicated.

33:46.357 --> 33:50.528
And then he mentioned in passing
about giving this talk and...

33:51.230 --> 33:53.531
I don't know...
I thought it would
be kind of fun to surprise him.

33:53.598 --> 33:58.237
Not in a romantic way. It just
feels like a good first step
back

33:58.269 --> 34:01.539
- towards where we used to be.
- That's great.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.208
Viva Cleveland!

34:03.241 --> 34:05.778
Really? I didn't know what you
would think.

34:05.810 --> 34:09.748
I know you had issues before
about George, and George and me.

34:09.782 --> 34:13.385
My problem before was that you
didn't know what you wanted.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.054
I mean, you were stuck in the
past.

34:16.088 --> 34:19.458
I never thought you'd clean
out that locker, but you did.

34:19.525 --> 34:22.327
And then you had that affair at
the office.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.164
How did you know about that?

34:25.230 --> 34:27.331
April and I have no secrets.

34:27.365 --> 34:32.570
But my point is, you just
seem so much lighter now,

34:32.637 --> 34:34.639
and that makes me happy.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.643
Well, that's very sweet.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.179
Okay, admit it.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.713
Falling in love has definitely
made you a nicer person.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.851
Yeah. Well, there's a
downside to everything.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.623
Show me the video.

34:52.190 --> 34:53.692
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you wanted

34:53.724 --> 34:55.293
to check out this bar with me.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.596
Thanks for inviting me.
I was kind of surprised.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.599
I'm not really the go-to girl
for checking out cool bars.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.601
Yeah, well, I just figured we
hadn't hung out in a while,
so...

35:05.103 --> 35:08.840
So yeah, first, just to, like,
get this out of the way, um...

35:08.873 --> 35:11.543
This thing came up recently
and I didn't want to
make a big deal out of it,

35:11.577 --> 35:14.445
but it always feels weird to bring
up anything serious over text.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.483
- Anything serious?
- It's not even that serious.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.318
It's just that...

35:20.385 --> 35:22.487
Dominic and I are seeing each
other.

35:22.521 --> 35:26.257
- Um...
- Yeah.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.494
At first I thought it was
just a friends thing...

35:28.559 --> 35:31.295
At first? How long has this been
going on?

35:31.362 --> 35:33.164
We haven't been hooking up that
long...

35:33.197 --> 35:36.902
Okay, you guys are just hooking
up. That makes way more sense.

35:37.668 --> 35:40.639
Why does that make more sense?

35:40.672 --> 35:43.842
You think Dominic couldn't
possibly want to date me for
real?

35:45.777 --> 35:49.547
I shouldn't even have to ask you
for permission. You're not with
him.

35:50.382 --> 35:53.552
And you have a boyfriend!
What, were you trying
to save Dominic for later?

35:53.585 --> 35:55.320
No, I'm didn't say that. I'm
over Dominic.

35:55.353 --> 35:58.523
- Then why are you even
making...
- Because it's weird!

35:58.590 --> 36:00.157
And we're family!

36:00.224 --> 36:02.927
So family members are supposed
to deprive each other of
happiness

36:03.195 --> 36:05.163
just to protect their own egos?

36:06.398 --> 36:09.835
Sorry. I already spent 22 years
of my life

36:09.902 --> 36:11.869
feeling like I'm losing a man
to you. I'm not doing it again.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.739
That was different. That
was neither of our faults.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.775
This isn't either! This is two
people who want to be together.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.278
I'm sorry if you think
I don't deserve to be with
somebody like him,

36:20.344 --> 36:22.813
but that's not for you to
say. I'm gonna leave now.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.617
Because if I have a drink,
I'm just gonna get mean.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.666
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.833
Didn't think you'd still be
here,

36:42.900 --> 36:44.335
since it's after lunch.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.371
Probably have a gal pal
to meet for happy hour.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.307
Okay, I know that you don't
think

36:49.373 --> 36:50.943
I should have left when I did
last night,

36:51.208 --> 36:53.445
but I don't want you to think
that I'm slacking or anything.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.380
This job is a huge priority for
me.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.983
But is it your first priority?

36:59.518 --> 37:02.320
Old April would have
answered "yes" 30 seconds ago.

37:02.387 --> 37:05.289
Can we just agree that there
are different models of success?

37:05.324 --> 37:07.693
I respect how you got where you
are

37:07.726 --> 37:09.661
and your decision not to have
a romantic partner, but...

37:09.728 --> 37:11.829
- I'm not single.
- I thought you said

37:11.862 --> 37:14.266
you walked away from the picket
fence.

37:14.298 --> 37:16.802
I meant I don't have a
traditional relationship.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.003
Samir and I don't even
live in the same country.

37:19.271 --> 37:22.608
- He's a correspondent in
Afghanistan.
- Wow.

37:22.641 --> 37:26.411
- That must be really hard.
- It's actually ideal.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.313
No one is ever disappointed.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.715
No guilt trips if we can't talk
every day.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.650
And the eight-hour time
difference is perfect.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.452
When I'm going to bed, he's
getting up.

37:34.485 --> 37:35.987
That's when we talk on the
phone.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.255
You must worry about him,
though.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.557
I mean, it's still pretty
dangerous over there.

37:41.293 --> 37:44.795
I'd rather he take risks
and do a job he loves

37:44.862 --> 37:48.300
than be stuck in a boring
nine-to-five job he hates.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.336
Maybe some of us just aren't
meant
to put our work first like that.

37:52.403 --> 37:55.974
I love this job just as much
as I did before I got sick.

37:56.007 --> 37:58.309
The only difference now is that

37:58.342 --> 38:00.978
I love the rest of my life that
much too.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.318
Maybe this sounds dramatic,
but when I was in the hospital,

38:06.385 --> 38:08.719
I had a lot of time to think

38:09.320 --> 38:11.989
about how I want to be
remembered.

38:12.858 --> 38:15.893
And I definitely want to be
remembered

38:15.960 --> 38:18.396
as a great reporter.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.699
But I also want to be a great
daughter,

38:21.766 --> 38:25.871
and friend and girlfriend, too...

38:25.936 --> 38:28.306
If that's even humanly possible.

38:28.373 --> 38:30.976
I guess we'll see if it is.

38:46.557 --> 38:48.927
- Hey!
- Hi.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.663
I thought your dad

38:51.730 --> 38:53.532
was picking you up earlier to
pack.

38:53.597 --> 38:56.967
- Isn't that why you left before
me?
- Uh, no. I lied.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.070
I was meeting the delivery guy.

38:59.737 --> 39:02.574
Are you taking this to
Nantucket?

39:02.641 --> 39:05.577
No, it's for you...

39:05.643 --> 39:10.481
And your family. I thought it
was a poetic way to say goodbye,

39:10.548 --> 39:13.518
since it's sort of how we first
bonded.

39:13.552 --> 39:16.954
- On the tennis courts.
- I love it. Thank you.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.961
You have to keep in touch.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.833
We'll see if I get service
on my private island.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.369
So if we're doing this

39:32.436 --> 39:34.139
like the first time,

39:34.405 --> 39:37.108
I'm about to kick your ass, huh?

39:37.375 --> 39:38.844
I'm not that sentimental.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.460
Hi there, ma'am. Checking
in for the convention?

39:55.527 --> 39:57.896
No, I'm actually checking in to
the hotel,

39:57.963 --> 39:59.831
but I am here to support
one of the speakers.

39:59.898 --> 40:03.601
- Husband?
- Nope. Just my brother-in-law.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.737
Okay, well, once you've
checked into your room,
if you want to find him,

40:06.804 --> 40:09.141
I know there's
welcome drinks for
panelists at the bar right now.

40:09.173 --> 40:10.608
Oh. Thanks.

40:33.697 --> 40:37.001
Well, cheers again to your
big week. You killed it.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.804
Thanks.

40:38.869 --> 40:41.072
Mm! And my condolences to you.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.840
I know you wanted some of that
scoop.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.876
You forget, I'm not like you.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.045
I don't see your success as my
failure.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.447
Well, that's just weird.

40:51.715 --> 40:54.552
- I'm gonna take off.
- Where you headed next?

40:54.619 --> 40:57.822
- Uh... back to the office.
- Really?

40:57.889 --> 40:59.958
- Is 10 bucks enough?
- No, it's on me.

41:00.724 --> 41:03.494
Oh. Thanks.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.498
- Have a nice night.
- I will.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.778
Hey, Bubs.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.847
Yeah, no, I'm coming home early.

41:22.914 --> 41:25.083
I know.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.985
I might actually get six
hours of sleep tonight.

41:30.021 --> 41:33.090
Well, that all depends.
What'd you make for dinner?

41:34.626 --> 41:37.896
You know, honey, let me call
you when I get outside. Okay.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.231
- Glad I caught you on your way
out.
- Yeah, you always do.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.932
- The patient file you wanted.
- Thank you.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.969
Hey, did those numbers stop
dropping?

41:48.106 --> 41:50.507
Can you ask the on-call
nurse if we have a bed?

41:50.541 --> 41:51.775
Of course.

42:37.755 --> 42:39.123
Hey, this is April Carver.

42:39.190 --> 42:40.992
Leave a message.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.228
Hi, April. It's Dr. Hamburg.

42:43.295 --> 42:46.164
Um, I would love to see you
tomorrow morning for a
follow-up,

42:46.231 --> 42:49.233
so give me a call when you get
this.

42:49.300 --> 42:51.068
I hope you have a great night.
