00:27.338 --> 00:31.630
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:51.130 --> 00:53.338
Just a few hours to go

00:53.421 --> 00:55.880
until the moment
everyone's been waiting for,

00:55.963 --> 00:58.921
lying on lounge chairs or on the grass,

00:59.005 --> 01:01.213
eyes glued to the sky.

01:01.505 --> 01:04.546
Tonight, a rare phenomenon will occur.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.838
A total lunar eclipse.

01:07.213 --> 01:08.921
And it certainly is rare.

01:09.005 --> 01:11.588
The next one is expected in 2033,

01:11.671 --> 01:15.463
and one hasn't been seen in France
since 1998.

01:15.546 --> 01:18.296
This is the first sighting
in the 21st century.

01:18.380 --> 01:21.921
As luck would have it,
tonight's weather conditions are ideal.

01:22.005 --> 01:25.838
Many onlookers will attempt
to capture this moment.

01:26.171 --> 01:28.963
To do that, sophisticated equipment
is not necessary.

01:29.046 --> 01:32.213
A regular camera or smartphone
will do the trick.

01:32.296 --> 01:36.005
A word to the wise:
don't be superstitious.

01:36.088 --> 01:37.796
Eclipses are not without risk.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.171
In fact, legend has it
that during lunar eclipses

01:41.255 --> 01:44.421
incredible things can happen.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.296
At the precise moment
the moon is completely hidden,

01:47.380 --> 01:50.005
time is said to stand still,

01:50.088 --> 01:53.171
and your deepest sins are washed away...

01:57.671 --> 02:02.505
Your soul is condemned to be trapped
in limbo for the rest of eternity.

02:02.588 --> 02:04.838
Simply a legend, of course, but--

02:06.171 --> 02:08.255
Enough with the eclipse already!

02:14.338 --> 02:15.630
You look stunning.

02:17.880 --> 02:18.796
Thanks.

02:19.921 --> 02:21.171
How are you getting back?

02:23.046 --> 02:26.630
Oh, no, not the bus. I thought
I'd walk back seeing as I don't live far.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.588
Oh, you're staying over?

02:28.671 --> 02:32.296
Conditions are perfect. Not a cloud…

02:33.880 --> 02:34.838
No way!

02:35.963 --> 02:37.005
Definitely not!

02:37.880 --> 02:38.880
I'll call you back.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.380
You're going out like that?

02:44.463 --> 02:45.463
Yeah, why?

02:46.088 --> 02:48.546
-Where are you going tonight?
-I told you, Zoé's party.

02:49.005 --> 02:51.796
-I don't believe you.
-Don't believe me then.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.755
What is this?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.588
-You searched my bag?
-No.

02:55.671 --> 02:58.671
-I can't believe you went through my bag!
-So what? What is this?

02:58.755 --> 03:00.755
Condoms. It's written on the box.

03:01.255 --> 03:02.088
Margot...

03:02.880 --> 03:03.921
They're not mine.

03:04.296 --> 03:07.005
-Why are they in your bag?
-Zoé asked me to look after them.

03:07.088 --> 03:09.671
Is that so? And why can't Zoé
keep them herself?

03:09.755 --> 03:12.130
Because her mom is crazy.
She goes through her stuff.

03:12.213 --> 03:14.046
She should make an appointment with you.

03:29.130 --> 03:31.338
-Don't call again!
-I bet they're still up.

03:31.421 --> 03:33.630
She told you she was going
to put them to bed.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.380
Don't be silly. You'll wake them.

03:37.671 --> 03:39.546
-Asleep?
-I can't hear anything.

03:40.546 --> 03:42.213
Hello?

03:42.796 --> 03:43.755
What do I do?

03:43.838 --> 03:45.088
Hold out the phone, Mom.

03:45.171 --> 03:47.463
Hold it out? What do you mean?

03:47.546 --> 03:48.880
-Like this?
-Exactly.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.088
You need to put them to bed.

03:51.171 --> 03:53.713
It takes time, Charlotte.
They're kids, you know.

03:53.796 --> 03:55.671
Yes, I know. They are mine, you know.

03:55.755 --> 03:58.380
Mom, not too late, please.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.963
Yes, honey, I'll do it now.

04:00.421 --> 04:03.588
Tell your wife I raised kids without her.

04:03.671 --> 04:06.546
-She should watch her tone.
-Yes, I can hear you, Grandma.

04:08.005 --> 04:10.255
Okay, my darlings. Good night!

04:10.338 --> 04:12.421
-Goodnight, Daddy and Mommy.
-Goodnight!

04:12.505 --> 04:13.671
Goodnight, honey.

04:14.713 --> 04:15.630
Goodnight, Mom.

04:22.588 --> 04:25.005
Hang on. You went through her bag?

04:26.130 --> 04:26.963
Yes.

04:27.046 --> 04:28.130
You searched her bag?

04:28.213 --> 04:30.338
Yes... but that's not the point...

04:30.421 --> 04:31.671
-Yes, it is.
-Vincent!

04:31.755 --> 04:35.338
Our daughter is rejecting
the parental structure.

04:35.421 --> 04:37.046
Yes, but that happens to be normal.

04:37.130 --> 04:39.505
But she's 17,
and she's lucky enough to have parents

04:39.588 --> 04:42.130
who are both doctors. We have to help her.

04:42.921 --> 04:44.463
Listen. I totally agree with you.

04:44.546 --> 04:47.046
She needs advice from her mother,
not from a shrink.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.213
Was it always this high up?

05:01.171 --> 05:02.171
How are you?

05:02.255 --> 05:03.130
I'm okay.

05:03.546 --> 05:05.505
-Is Ben here?
-No, not yet.

05:05.588 --> 05:07.713
-Have you met his date?
-No.

05:07.796 --> 05:09.630
-Tiramisu.
-Yes, as usual.

05:10.005 --> 05:13.088
Good, because Vincent's being
creative again. Foie gras in milk...

05:13.171 --> 05:14.421
In milk?

05:14.838 --> 05:15.671
Hi, guys.

05:15.755 --> 05:16.963
Oh, hi!

05:18.046 --> 05:18.880
Welcome.

05:18.963 --> 05:20.588
You made foie gras in milk?

05:21.838 --> 05:23.171
It's a surprise.

05:23.546 --> 05:25.505
You know I'm allergic to lactose.

05:25.796 --> 05:27.046
But not to foie gras?

05:34.963 --> 05:35.796
Wait.

05:36.046 --> 05:37.088
Answer it.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.796
The dispatcher must need drivers.
But I'm off this weekend.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.213
So don't answer. We have plans.

05:43.296 --> 05:44.171
Yeah...

05:45.296 --> 05:46.421
Dinner at my mom's.

05:47.130 --> 05:48.588
-I'm not kidding.
-I know.

05:49.421 --> 05:51.838
-I was thinking of other plans.
-Oh, yeah?

05:52.963 --> 05:55.338
Show me the wine.
The label looks cheap, no?

05:55.421 --> 05:57.630
No! It's from the wine shop
opposite the salon.

05:57.713 --> 05:59.630
It's biodynamic. Apparently, it's great.

05:59.713 --> 06:01.671
For 25 euros, I should hope so!

06:01.755 --> 06:03.463
-It just needs degassing.
-What?

06:03.546 --> 06:05.088
Shaking it releases the gas.

06:05.171 --> 06:07.171
The wine's not expensive, the gas is.

06:07.796 --> 06:09.338
-Yeah, right.
-What are you doing?

06:09.421 --> 06:12.380
-Removing the price tag.
-For 25 euros, you can leave it on!

06:12.463 --> 06:15.463
Even better, put it on the neck, watch.
Like this.

06:15.546 --> 06:17.755
-"Hello, good evening!"
-Honey...

06:18.505 --> 06:19.546
Stop it.

06:19.630 --> 06:21.963
This elevator takes forever.
Let's take the stairs.

06:22.046 --> 06:24.796
-But it's here!
-Let's race, first one to the top!

06:29.421 --> 06:30.255
Oh, yeah.

06:30.546 --> 06:31.880
So, what do you think?

06:32.630 --> 06:33.755
Well, it's white.

06:34.463 --> 06:35.296
And?

06:35.380 --> 06:37.046
I can't digest sulfites.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.213
-They give me...
-What?

06:40.046 --> 06:40.880
Heartburn.

06:40.963 --> 06:42.630
Does it?

06:42.713 --> 06:44.005
It's a good Muscadet.

06:44.088 --> 06:45.338
I totally agree.

06:48.463 --> 06:51.130
-Are you okay? You look a little tired.
-Yes, I know.

06:51.213 --> 06:52.171
Would you top me up?

06:52.255 --> 06:54.463
-What are we having to start?
-It's a surprise.

06:54.546 --> 06:56.880
Here's the surprise. Ben's new girl.

06:58.963 --> 07:00.421
-How's it going?
-Good, yourself?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.046
Nope.

07:03.171 --> 07:05.130
-Where's Thomas?
-On his way up.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.213
I win.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.671
I'll beat you on the way down.

07:10.005 --> 07:10.838
Hi, you.

07:13.713 --> 07:15.463
Okay, guys...

07:16.171 --> 07:17.505
-Okay.
-How's it going?

07:18.546 --> 07:19.755
-How are you?
-Hey.

07:19.838 --> 07:21.546
-Is he here?
-No, he isn't here yet.

07:21.630 --> 07:24.088
And no, I haven't met her.
Here, give me your jacket.

07:25.921 --> 07:26.755
Okay...

07:26.838 --> 07:28.963
Do you guys know Ben's date?

07:29.046 --> 07:31.380
-No, we thought you did.
-You look great!

07:31.463 --> 07:32.921
-It'll be a surprise.
-Thanks.

07:33.546 --> 07:34.588
-What?
-It's a surprise.

07:34.671 --> 07:35.921
I like the new color.

07:36.005 --> 07:37.505
-You think so? Thanks.
-I love it.

07:37.880 --> 07:38.963
Here.

07:39.046 --> 07:40.046
-Thanks.
-Sure.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.421
-Yeah, you look it.
-Hi!

07:41.505 --> 07:43.713
-Hi, how are you?
-Good, and yourself?

07:44.880 --> 07:46.005
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:47.255 --> 07:49.630
-Here. It's biodynamic.
-Really?

07:49.713 --> 07:50.796
Which means what?

07:50.880 --> 07:53.380
-It means it costs a fortune. Look.
-Baby!

07:53.463 --> 07:55.088
-25.90 a bottle, look!
-No, stop it!

07:55.171 --> 07:57.255
-Better be good then.
-How are you?

07:57.338 --> 07:59.005
-Have some Muscadet.
-It's good.

07:59.088 --> 08:01.255
It's good, but it gives me heartburn.

08:01.338 --> 08:02.296
Can I help?

08:02.380 --> 08:04.380
No, he'll yell at you. It's a surprise.

08:04.463 --> 08:06.171
-Ah, a surprise!
-Yes.

08:06.755 --> 08:08.338
He cooked foie gras in milk.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.546
It's my cooking class birthday gift.

08:10.755 --> 08:12.588
A secret starter and a main dish.

08:12.671 --> 08:14.630
-It's a surprise.
-It smells good.

08:15.005 --> 08:16.088
What's wrong?

08:16.588 --> 08:18.880
You didn't have to share your gift.

08:18.963 --> 08:20.463
It was for you.

08:20.546 --> 08:22.588
But it's your favorite dish, with a twist.

08:22.671 --> 08:25.671
-Are you okay? You look a bit tired.
-Yes, apparently so.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.880
Stop by the salon. My boss is on holiday,
I'll give you a free facial.

08:28.963 --> 08:32.921
-I'd love to, but Saturday's for the kids.
-Go on, my mother can look after them.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.796
No. You go.

08:34.880 --> 08:35.713
Me?

08:36.046 --> 08:37.880
My wife isn't waxing your bikini line!

08:37.963 --> 08:39.380
Ah, no. Marco waxes his chest.

08:39.463 --> 08:41.213
-What?
-You wax your chest?

08:41.296 --> 08:42.463
That's just great.

08:43.796 --> 08:45.963
-And you let him?
-I don't have a choice!

08:46.046 --> 08:47.463
And he uses moisturizer.

08:47.546 --> 08:49.546
Why are you telling everyone?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.838
Wait, we've known each other for 35 years,

08:51.921 --> 08:53.838
and we just find out you wax your chest?

08:53.921 --> 08:55.713
-And uses moisturizer.
-Must be so soft.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.171
No, I don't wax.
I shave occasionally, that's it.

08:58.255 --> 09:01.213
The moisturizer is for a hereditary
problem from my father's side.

09:01.296 --> 09:02.380
Very dry skin.

09:02.463 --> 09:03.338
He's all dried out!

09:03.421 --> 09:06.046
-Many men use moisturizers.
-There's nothing wrong with it.

09:06.130 --> 09:06.963
It's not funny!

09:07.046 --> 09:08.630
Lots of men do that, don't they?

09:08.713 --> 09:11.671
-What do you think Ben's date looks like?
-No idea, but be cool.

09:11.755 --> 09:15.505
It's his first girl since the divorce.
Don't scare her off.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.713
Enough pistachios. There's tons of food.
You'll be full.

09:18.796 --> 09:21.630
-I can see him with an older woman.
-Totally, that's his thing.

09:21.713 --> 09:23.588
-Like a MIFL, but even older.
-It's MILF.

09:23.671 --> 09:25.296
-That's what I said.
-You said MIFL.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.380
What's that?

09:27.463 --> 09:30.005
A MILF? Much older than you.

09:30.088 --> 09:31.046
Nice.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.505
This wine has a weird taste.
Almost like Coke.

09:33.588 --> 09:35.171
Darn, we didn't degas it!

09:35.546 --> 09:36.963
I was thinking "dump it."

09:37.046 --> 09:37.880
Yes?

09:38.255 --> 09:40.380
-28A23.
-Is it Ben?

09:40.796 --> 09:44.130
I've given it to you loads of times.
See you in a sec.

09:44.213 --> 09:45.046
Ben?

09:45.463 --> 09:46.380
They're here.

09:52.796 --> 09:53.755
-Hi.
-But...

09:53.838 --> 09:54.671
Where's...

09:56.421 --> 09:57.255
What?

09:58.130 --> 09:59.088
You're alone?

09:59.171 --> 10:00.338
Oh, that...

10:00.921 --> 10:01.755
Stomach flu.

10:01.838 --> 10:03.880
-Oh, no!
-So she's not coming?

10:04.296 --> 10:05.755
Not with stomach flu.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.338
-No MILF.
-What a shame.

10:08.421 --> 10:10.255
-That means more food for us.
-Vincent!

10:10.338 --> 10:11.421
It's going around.

10:11.505 --> 10:12.671
So should I stay or...

10:13.088 --> 10:15.713
-Of course, come in!
-Sorry, come on in.

10:15.796 --> 10:16.713
Sorry.

10:18.380 --> 10:19.255
Here, Vincent.

10:19.505 --> 10:20.755
-What happened?
-She's sick.

10:20.838 --> 10:23.088
-Did you have a fight?
-No.

10:23.171 --> 10:25.005
I hope these aren't biodynamic.

10:25.421 --> 10:26.588
They had a fight.

10:26.671 --> 10:27.588
No, we didn't!

10:28.046 --> 10:29.296
I'll take it.

10:35.380 --> 10:37.338
Marie, what's on the menu?

10:37.713 --> 10:39.505
Don't worry, you won't be disappointed.

10:39.921 --> 10:41.380
How old did you say she was?

10:41.463 --> 10:43.380
-I didn't.
-He didn't.

10:44.213 --> 10:46.713
Guys, we agreed.
No jokes about Ben's new girlfriend.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.255
It's fine. She's not here.

10:48.338 --> 10:50.130
I'm here. What were the jokes?

10:50.213 --> 10:53.713
We wondered what she looks like.
Tall, short...

10:53.796 --> 10:55.963
-Brunette, blonde...
-Silver gray...

10:56.046 --> 10:58.421
Silver gray?
You see me with an old woman?

10:58.505 --> 11:01.630
Not necessarily.
But you do like women that are a bit...

11:02.338 --> 11:03.296
A little what?

11:03.380 --> 11:04.588
Silver gray.

11:05.088 --> 11:07.005
-No.
-Don't deny it.

11:07.088 --> 11:08.921
How old was your ex, Catherine?

11:09.005 --> 11:10.755
Don't say "was." She's not dead.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.171
-She could be.
-Stop teasing him.

11:13.255 --> 11:14.671
It's your turn, my arm hurts.

11:14.755 --> 11:16.921
Okay, so now you're making jokes
about Ben's ex?

11:17.005 --> 11:17.921
No, it's not that...

11:18.005 --> 11:19.630
Actually, she deserves it.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.755
-Try the pistachio in the olive.
-Pistachios--

11:21.838 --> 11:24.880
Stop eating! I've made lots of food.
You'll be full. It's not funny.

11:24.963 --> 11:25.880
What did you make?

11:26.338 --> 11:27.463
It's a surprise.

11:47.671 --> 11:49.838
Ever wonder why you like old women?

11:49.921 --> 11:51.671
I don't like old women!

11:51.755 --> 11:54.546
Lots of old women like younger men.
Like Madonna.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.546
It's true. Maybe it's her.

11:56.630 --> 11:58.296
-Who?
-Ben's date could be Madonna.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.213
No way.

11:59.296 --> 12:01.213
I can't see Madonna
having the stomach flu.

12:01.296 --> 12:02.130
Why not?

12:02.671 --> 12:04.380
-Come for a smoke?
-I don't smoke.

12:04.463 --> 12:05.296
So? Come on.

12:05.380 --> 12:08.130
I can picture you guys
with the stomach flu, but not Madonna.

12:08.213 --> 12:09.171
Thanks. Charming.

12:09.630 --> 12:12.088
This wine's a pain. It better be good.

12:13.130 --> 12:14.255
So who's this girl?

12:16.671 --> 12:17.630
Is it serious?

12:17.963 --> 12:18.921
I don't know.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.005
-What do you mean you don't know?
-Maybe.

12:22.338 --> 12:24.588
-So who's this girl?
-Do we know her?

12:24.671 --> 12:25.505
No.

12:25.588 --> 12:27.005
-Are you in love?
-I don't know.

12:27.088 --> 12:27.921
You are!

12:28.380 --> 12:30.713
-Look at him!
-How can I know?

12:30.796 --> 12:31.880
I know.

12:32.505 --> 12:35.671
If you call her for more
than 30 minutes a day, you're in love.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.213
And the day you stop calling,
you're married.

12:39.421 --> 12:40.755
-Yes.
-That's not true.

12:42.255 --> 12:43.213
What's so funny?

12:43.921 --> 12:44.755
Nothing.

12:45.588 --> 12:46.671
Girl talk.

12:46.755 --> 12:47.796
Girl talk?

12:48.671 --> 12:50.838
-Am I intruding?
-No, of course not.

12:50.921 --> 12:52.505
Are going to taste this wine then?

12:52.588 --> 12:54.088
Maybe we shook it too much.

12:54.171 --> 12:55.838
So when do we meet her?

12:55.921 --> 12:57.713
Some other time. I'll be back.

12:57.796 --> 12:59.630
-So?
-I'm not sure.

12:59.713 --> 13:01.671
-Where's he going?
-Stomach flu.

13:02.005 --> 13:03.421
That's very tasteful.

13:05.796 --> 13:07.963
-What's he doing?
-Did you wash your hands?

13:08.671 --> 13:10.546
-Picture time.
-Oh, no, Ben, no pictures.

13:10.630 --> 13:11.630
Yes!

13:11.713 --> 13:13.171
I bought this gadget.

13:13.255 --> 13:14.671
You have tons of pictures.

13:14.755 --> 13:18.671
Especially since third grade.
It might be our only eclipse picture.

13:18.755 --> 13:20.963
He's right. Plus, I think it's so pretty.

13:22.005 --> 13:23.088
I've never seen one.

13:23.171 --> 13:25.921
Strange things can happen during eclipses.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.130
Are you really looking
at all the pictures?

13:28.213 --> 13:30.546
Yeah. I even made a hodge-podge.

13:30.630 --> 13:31.630
A what?

13:31.713 --> 13:33.088
-A "hodge-podge"?
-Yeah.

13:33.171 --> 13:34.671
Did he say "hodge-podge"?

13:35.088 --> 13:36.796
Do people still say that?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.880
The last time we said "later," we forgot.

13:38.963 --> 13:40.463
-Come on!
-It takes three seconds.

13:40.546 --> 13:42.838
You're right.
Last time, we didn't take one.

13:42.921 --> 13:44.380
Come on!

13:44.463 --> 13:45.921
-One...
-We did, but in a jiffy.

13:46.005 --> 13:46.880
Two...

13:47.796 --> 13:48.921
And...

13:49.005 --> 13:50.088
Ah! Kitchen!

13:50.171 --> 13:52.171
-Too late!
-No!

13:52.255 --> 13:54.255
The starter is hot, guys. Hop to it.

13:54.338 --> 13:55.171
No!

13:55.255 --> 13:56.088
Yes!

13:56.171 --> 13:57.380
We'll take it later.

14:08.255 --> 14:11.213
I don't see how it's easier
to sell breast implants than shoes.

14:11.296 --> 14:13.046
There's different shapes and sizes...

14:13.130 --> 14:15.463
Some women want round ones,
some pear-shaped.

14:15.546 --> 14:17.130
Flat-as-a-pancake ones...

14:17.213 --> 14:18.463
What a liar!

14:18.546 --> 14:20.838
So a guy wants a size 11.

14:20.921 --> 14:22.796
But you only have a ten in stock.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.296
-You try anyway.
-Do you manage?

14:24.380 --> 14:27.880
It depends. Sometimes you can give him
a little stocking so it glides on.

14:27.963 --> 14:30.880
Or if it's too big, you give him
a thick pair of socks.

14:30.963 --> 14:32.838
I've seen guys limp out the door.

14:33.338 --> 14:34.421
You lie to people?

14:34.505 --> 14:36.130
I saw something hilarious.

14:36.213 --> 14:38.088
You sell implants in pairs?

14:38.171 --> 14:40.546
I buy them in pairs,
but I don't sell them by pair.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.796
-I saw something hilarious.
-You buy them in pairs?

14:43.880 --> 14:45.921
Me too, I saw something hilarious.

14:46.338 --> 14:48.296
Yeah, but there are guys who work...

14:48.380 --> 14:51.171
Wait a minute, Ben has a funny story.

14:55.963 --> 14:59.005
This old guy has an attack on the bus.
He hits the deck.

14:59.088 --> 15:01.338
They try to save him, but he's dead.

15:01.421 --> 15:03.130
I hope the ending is funny.

15:03.505 --> 15:05.963
It is. And... Because...

15:06.046 --> 15:08.338
They try to reanimate him, but they can't.

15:08.421 --> 15:10.630
What's that thing that beeps?

15:10.713 --> 15:12.046
An electrocardiograph.

15:12.130 --> 15:14.630
-Yeah, the electrocardiogram...
-Not "gram," "graph."

15:14.713 --> 15:17.671
Whatever. It just beeps continuously.

15:18.963 --> 15:20.546
-Not a good sign.
-No.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.088
And then, suddenly, "Beep, beep, beep."

15:24.171 --> 15:26.713
Everyone is relieved.
The wife stops crying.

15:27.255 --> 15:28.088
But no.

15:28.963 --> 15:33.088
It's the old guy's phone,
receiving text messages.

15:35.838 --> 15:39.713
They start to hope.
They massage the heart again.

15:39.796 --> 15:41.505
The wife starts crying again.

15:41.755 --> 15:43.755
And...

15:44.505 --> 15:46.838
Meanwhile, the beeping continues.

15:46.921 --> 15:48.255
The wife freaks out.

15:48.338 --> 15:51.755
At each beep she thinks he's alive,
so she grabs the phone to switch it off.

15:51.838 --> 15:53.505
And she looks at it.

15:53.588 --> 15:55.421
And then... kaboom!

15:56.005 --> 15:56.838
Kaboom?

15:56.921 --> 15:59.880
-Go on.
-She reads the texts.

15:59.963 --> 16:02.338
She looks at what he was receiving.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.880
She realizes that her husband
had a mistress

16:04.963 --> 16:06.421
who was sexting him.

16:08.130 --> 16:09.963
Kinky text messages.

16:10.046 --> 16:13.463
-No idea what those are.
-Don't deny it, you send me loads.

16:13.546 --> 16:14.380
Be quiet!

16:14.463 --> 16:17.838
And so the old lady is widowed
and two-timed all at once.

16:24.255 --> 16:25.088
That's it?

16:25.546 --> 16:26.380
Yes.

16:27.380 --> 16:28.588
That's revolting.

16:28.671 --> 16:31.505
You did say that it was going to be
a funny story.

16:31.588 --> 16:33.255
Yeah, but... it's not funny?

16:34.213 --> 16:35.796
Hang on, his phone wasn't locked?

16:35.880 --> 16:37.255
I guess not.

16:37.338 --> 16:38.755
How stupid can you be?

16:38.838 --> 16:39.755
Why?

16:39.838 --> 16:43.588
You have to be stupid to not lock
your phone, especially if you're cheating.

16:44.255 --> 16:46.963
Well, that's reassuring.
You lock yours, don't you?

16:48.046 --> 16:49.338
Of course I do...

16:49.671 --> 16:51.296
Everybody does. Don't you?

16:51.380 --> 16:53.296
No, not everybody does.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.213
The guy on the bus didn't.

16:55.630 --> 16:58.296
-No, he definitely didn't.
-That's why he's stupid.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.588
I don't lock mine.

16:59.671 --> 17:01.588
-Me neither.
-You don't?

17:01.671 --> 17:03.546
No, I don't. We're a "no-lock" couple.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.296
-We don't lock ours.
-I can see that.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.921
So... how are the oysters?

17:13.046 --> 17:14.088
Not bad.

17:15.546 --> 17:18.755
-They're warm. It's unusual.
-Less cold.

17:19.463 --> 17:23.130
-Is there still an oil slick in Brittany?
-For God's sake, it's squid ink.

17:23.213 --> 17:26.171
-I thought you loved oysters.
-Yeah, but they give me mouth sores.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.713
They're oysters!

17:28.046 --> 17:29.421
Why didn't you say so?

17:30.546 --> 17:33.505
-I like the capers.
-Well, next time I'll only do capers.

17:33.838 --> 17:35.255
-Capers au gratin.
-Stop it.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.963
You've only cooked things I can't eat.

17:38.046 --> 17:39.213
You can't eat anything.

17:39.296 --> 17:40.296
What do you eat?

17:40.713 --> 17:41.713
I eat everything.

17:42.255 --> 17:45.088
At home, my mother cooks.
I eat everything.

17:45.171 --> 17:48.255
Yes, he eats everything mommy makes.

17:48.546 --> 17:50.088
You like water?

17:50.171 --> 17:51.046
Water, sure.

17:51.130 --> 17:53.921
I don't like the taste,
but I can drink it.

17:54.005 --> 17:57.380
Mobile phones have become
the black box of couples, don't you think?

17:58.505 --> 17:59.505
Why do you say that?

18:00.005 --> 18:02.213
I was thinking of Ben's story.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.463
Imagine the number of divorces

18:04.546 --> 18:07.088
if everybody went snooping
through their partner's phone.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.296
If you've got nothing to hide...

18:15.171 --> 18:16.880
Go on then, let's see yours.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.046
My what?

18:18.130 --> 18:19.380
Your phone. Show me.

18:19.963 --> 18:21.171
But it's personal.

18:21.255 --> 18:25.546
Make up your mind. You just said it's not
a problem if you've nothing to hide.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.255
Okay.

18:29.296 --> 18:31.213
But if I show you mine, you show me yours.

18:38.588 --> 18:40.505
Look, their hands are shaking.

18:42.005 --> 18:42.838
What?

18:46.296 --> 18:48.880
So, Léa, Thomas can look
through your phone?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.463
I don't even lock mine.

18:52.546 --> 18:54.171
Yeah, and I'm not nosy.

18:55.338 --> 18:57.546
And you? You'd show yours to Vincent?

18:59.296 --> 19:02.505
I don't want to know
what's in her phone. I don't care.

19:02.921 --> 19:04.088
You don't care?

19:04.838 --> 19:06.463
No, I don't.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.588
But if you want to see mine, no problem.

19:09.963 --> 19:12.755
Just photos of fake tits
and fat liposuctioned butts.

19:12.838 --> 19:13.880
Wow!

19:13.963 --> 19:15.713
-It's just work.
-Show me.

19:16.296 --> 19:17.296
It's confidential.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.796
-Come on, he saw, show me!
-It's medical privacy.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.505
He said, "Medical privacy."

19:22.088 --> 19:23.171
Let's play a game.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.338
-A game?
-Since we have nothing to hide,

19:26.421 --> 19:29.213
we could put all of our phones
on the table,

19:29.296 --> 19:31.546
and anything received this evening,

19:31.630 --> 19:34.213
e-mails, texts, calls...

19:34.296 --> 19:36.088
all that social network stuff...

19:36.921 --> 19:40.296
We look at everything together
and read everything out loud.

19:44.130 --> 19:45.213
It'll be lots of fun.

19:45.296 --> 19:48.380
Fun? I doubt that. It's not fun at all.

19:48.463 --> 19:51.255
She's right, sounds like fun to me.
I'm in.

19:51.338 --> 19:52.296
Thanks.

19:52.380 --> 19:53.255
There we go.

19:57.755 --> 19:59.380
-Come on!
-Come on!

20:00.671 --> 20:01.671
Ben?

20:03.255 --> 20:06.796
Stop with the games. The last time
we played Trivial Pursuit, we fought.

20:08.213 --> 20:09.963
Seriously, it'll be fun.

20:10.046 --> 20:12.588
-Yeah!
-No, it won't be fun at all.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.796
Why are you being so stubborn?

20:17.213 --> 20:18.046
No!

20:19.380 --> 20:20.296
Yes.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.713
Should I assume you're hiding something?

20:25.505 --> 20:26.505
I...

20:27.255 --> 20:28.463
I'm totally serious.

20:33.296 --> 20:34.130
Okay.

20:36.130 --> 20:37.630
-You don't have to.
-There you go.

20:38.463 --> 20:39.463
Thanks.

20:40.088 --> 20:42.171
Once we've had enough, we can stop.

20:42.921 --> 20:45.046
It's fun. Like a modern version

20:45.130 --> 20:47.838
of "Truth or Dare" when we were kids.

20:49.171 --> 20:50.963
Come on, honey.

20:52.463 --> 20:53.838
-Honey?
-Yes!

20:53.921 --> 20:56.505
Hell, we must be an old couple
if you're saying honey!

20:56.588 --> 20:58.713
-If it makes you happy.
-Yes, it does.

20:58.796 --> 21:01.130
If you're happy, I'm happy.

21:01.838 --> 21:04.588
Personally, I think this is pretty tacky.

21:04.671 --> 21:05.546
Why?

21:05.880 --> 21:07.130
This is a dinner party.

21:07.546 --> 21:10.171
Is that why you always place yours
face down?

21:12.338 --> 21:13.171
I see.

21:15.213 --> 21:16.130
Very well.

21:16.630 --> 21:17.463
Watch.

21:18.671 --> 21:19.921
Face up this time.

21:20.588 --> 21:21.421
I love it!

21:22.921 --> 21:23.755
Me too.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.755
-Margot!
-Hi, Margot.

21:39.838 --> 21:42.255
-Well, I'm off.
-You'll catch cold like that.

21:42.338 --> 21:43.838
I keep telling her that.

21:44.338 --> 21:45.505
Can I talk to you?

21:45.588 --> 21:47.713
-She's grown up!
-I'm right here.

21:47.796 --> 21:49.588
Actually, can you come with me, please?

21:51.380 --> 21:52.505
I'll be right back.

21:53.963 --> 21:56.380
-Let's go.
-His daughter gives the orders.

21:56.463 --> 21:58.463
She's got him wrapped around her finger.

21:58.546 --> 21:59.463
What's up?

21:59.546 --> 22:01.755
Could you give me some money
for tonight?

22:02.505 --> 22:06.421
-Couldn't you have asked me in there?
-You know I hate asking in front of Mom.

22:15.588 --> 22:17.338
-Ben, pass me your plate.
-No, hang on.

22:17.421 --> 22:19.338
-But you like this stuff.
-Marie!

22:19.963 --> 22:21.630
What's with these oysters?

22:21.713 --> 22:23.171
The best is yet to come.

22:23.255 --> 22:25.546
-Pâté in milk.
-No, it's foie gras.

22:26.005 --> 22:27.505
Stop! Someone got a message!

22:27.963 --> 22:28.838
It's yours.

22:30.338 --> 22:31.630
"I want your body."

22:32.255 --> 22:33.088
Who is it?

22:33.171 --> 22:34.255
I don't know!

22:34.838 --> 22:37.505
I knew this was a bad idea.
We should stop right now.

22:38.130 --> 22:39.546
-Who is it?
-Leave it!

22:39.630 --> 22:42.588
The number's not saved in my phone.
It's a mistake.

22:49.921 --> 22:51.171
It's the same number!

22:52.588 --> 22:53.421
-No.
-Answer it!

22:53.505 --> 22:54.796
I don't know who it is!

22:54.880 --> 22:56.505
Answer and you'll find out.

22:58.088 --> 22:59.463
Put it on speakerphone.

23:03.921 --> 23:05.046
Hello, who is this?

23:08.046 --> 23:09.088
Hey, who is this?

23:10.796 --> 23:14.421
Hello? Answer, because...
I don't care, I'm hanging up.

23:14.505 --> 23:15.755
No, you won't!

23:16.546 --> 23:17.421
Hang on.

23:18.421 --> 23:20.421
I hear breathing. Someone's there.

23:21.796 --> 23:23.046
Hey, we can hear you.

23:23.755 --> 23:25.088
Answer, or else!

23:25.921 --> 23:26.755
Hey!

23:28.713 --> 23:30.046
What the hell is this?

23:30.796 --> 23:31.796
Answer, damn it.

23:33.171 --> 23:34.921
Hey!

23:35.005 --> 23:36.588
Thomas, darling...

23:38.046 --> 23:39.463
He's such an ass.

23:41.338 --> 23:42.338
You're such a...

23:42.421 --> 23:44.796
That'll teach him
to make fun of my oysters.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.005
Oh, Thomas, I want to see you naked,
completely naked!

23:50.421 --> 23:52.255
I knew it was him.

23:52.338 --> 23:53.421
I knew it.

23:53.505 --> 23:55.463
Him and his dumb-ass jokes!

23:56.130 --> 23:58.421
No, but... This game's no good.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.046
I already said so.

24:00.463 --> 24:02.213
Can I have my phone back?
I need to go.

24:02.296 --> 24:03.838
Of course. Thanks, honey.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.380
You could say goodbye.

24:06.463 --> 24:07.505
Sure. Bye.

24:09.255 --> 24:10.130
Wow...

24:10.213 --> 24:12.088
She isn't always like this.

24:12.171 --> 24:14.338
No... tonight she's being nice.

24:18.046 --> 24:19.921
Don't worry, you'll know what to do.

24:20.463 --> 24:22.046
-"You'll know what to do?"
-Yes.

24:22.130 --> 24:23.296
Are you pregnant?

24:25.088 --> 24:27.213
No, but we're working on it.

24:27.296 --> 24:28.380
Quite actively.

24:28.463 --> 24:29.421
Very actively.

24:29.505 --> 24:32.046
I think kids are
a "choice of convenience."

24:32.546 --> 24:34.296
Children, convenient?

24:34.630 --> 24:36.713
I don't think you realize
what you're saying.

24:36.796 --> 24:39.588
I do. Socially, it's very convenient.

24:39.671 --> 24:42.088
You get married, you have kids.
You fit the mold.

24:42.171 --> 24:43.630
No questions asked.

24:44.046 --> 24:46.171
I don't want a child just to fit the mold.

24:46.255 --> 24:47.630
I have my reasons.

24:47.713 --> 24:48.963
Name one.

24:49.046 --> 24:51.380
I don't know, there are lots of them.

24:53.255 --> 24:55.255
For a couple, it's an achievement.

24:56.630 --> 24:59.296
Sorry to tell you this,
but that's even worse.

24:59.838 --> 25:02.630
That means that neither of you
can be truly happy

25:02.713 --> 25:04.588
because your happiness
depends on another.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.838
That's harsh, Ben.

25:05.921 --> 25:06.796
Yes, I'm harsh.

25:08.213 --> 25:10.588
I want my happiness to depend on me.

25:11.255 --> 25:12.088
There.

25:12.171 --> 25:14.713
It's selfish, I know.
Then I'll die selfish.

25:14.796 --> 25:15.963
And alone.

25:17.463 --> 25:21.546
I know the day she tells me
I'm going to be a father, I'll...

25:22.838 --> 25:23.963
I'll cry.

25:24.796 --> 25:25.838
My love!

25:27.505 --> 25:30.088
Wait until she's 17 and talks back to you.

25:30.171 --> 25:32.088
That's when you'll cry.

25:33.171 --> 25:34.046
No way.

25:36.755 --> 25:38.505
It's my sister. What do I do?

25:38.588 --> 25:39.546
Answer it!

25:39.630 --> 25:41.880
It's the whole point of the game.

25:42.338 --> 25:43.671
Put it on speakerphone.

25:44.796 --> 25:46.130
You're on speakerphone!

25:47.130 --> 25:48.671
-He's such a pain!
-Ben!

25:48.755 --> 25:50.963
On speakerphone? Turn it off, please.

25:51.046 --> 25:53.380
-I can't.
-Why not?

25:53.463 --> 25:54.755
We're playing a game.

25:54.838 --> 25:57.046
-Hello, Laurence.
-Hi, Laurence.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.296
Hi, everyone.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.005
Forget it, I'll call you tomorrow.

26:00.671 --> 26:04.255
If it's about the job in Nantes,
tell your friend that I'm not interested.

26:04.338 --> 26:06.338
We'll discuss it tomorrow. Bye.

26:10.796 --> 26:11.880
Shit, I messed up.

26:11.963 --> 26:13.588
-We noticed.
-Sorry.

26:14.171 --> 26:15.505
What's this job in Nantes?

26:15.588 --> 26:20.421
Some friend told Laurence
about a teaching job in a private school.

26:21.505 --> 26:22.838
Why don't you want it?

26:24.546 --> 26:25.380
It's far away.

26:25.463 --> 26:26.838
It's not exactly Shanghai!

26:26.921 --> 26:28.630
I'd love to live by the sea.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.630
Is Nantes by the sea?

26:31.380 --> 26:33.338
Yeah, more or less.

26:34.130 --> 26:36.380
You want me to move far away?

26:36.463 --> 26:37.796
No!

26:37.880 --> 26:39.338
-Yep!
-Oh, pumpkin.

26:39.671 --> 26:42.588
Thanks for your concern,
but I've sent my CV to loads of places.

26:42.671 --> 26:44.213
Something will crop up.

26:44.296 --> 26:47.380
They can't fire you like that.
If you sue them, you'll win.

26:48.046 --> 26:49.380
They didn't fire me.

26:49.463 --> 26:51.921
They didn't renew my contract.
Nuance.

26:52.963 --> 26:54.963
Did they give you a reason?

26:55.671 --> 26:57.796
I think they want a new gym teacher.

26:58.213 --> 27:00.296
They want someone younger, I think.

27:07.296 --> 27:11.005
It's fine. I'll figure it out...
without having to go to Nantes.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.005
I'll find something else.

27:13.505 --> 27:14.880
Wait, they're not done.

27:15.255 --> 27:16.338
Yes, we are!

27:16.421 --> 27:18.088
But you haven't even started.

27:18.171 --> 27:20.505
It was great. Thanks.

27:21.213 --> 27:23.213
-Do you need a hand?
-No, I'm fine.

27:35.671 --> 27:36.505
You okay?

27:37.421 --> 27:38.255
Yeah.

27:41.713 --> 27:42.838
You're drunk!

27:42.921 --> 27:44.463
I'm not drunk!

27:45.880 --> 27:47.588
It's pretty tense between you two.

27:48.088 --> 27:49.505
Did something happen?

27:49.588 --> 27:51.213
Yeah, 15 years of marriage.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.505
We can't talk to each other
without fighting.

27:55.005 --> 27:56.463
How do you do it?

27:57.338 --> 27:58.171
Do what?

27:58.838 --> 28:00.213
Get along.

28:04.463 --> 28:05.380
Have a taste.

28:05.463 --> 28:06.588
-No.
-Go on, taste it.

28:06.671 --> 28:09.796
-I can't, there's milk in it.
-I made yours without milk. Taste it.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.505
-I'll have one bite.
-Go on.

28:12.171 --> 28:13.588
-It's hot!
-No, it isn't.

28:14.255 --> 28:15.088
Here.

28:18.088 --> 28:19.755
-It's hot!
-Yeah, but it's good.

28:20.338 --> 28:23.171
-It is. Did you add capers?
-No.

28:24.588 --> 28:25.421
You should.

28:26.296 --> 28:27.130
Okay...

28:27.921 --> 28:29.588
Seriously, you and Marie...

28:30.380 --> 28:31.755
what's your secret?

28:33.213 --> 28:34.213
I play it by ear.

28:35.713 --> 28:36.880
And sometimes I don't.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.213
Pass me the dish.

28:48.671 --> 28:50.546
-What's this?
-Broccoli purée.

28:51.921 --> 28:52.838
Here it comes!

28:55.546 --> 28:57.546
-What's that?
-Foie gras in milk.

28:58.046 --> 29:01.130
Don't start yet.
The side dish isn't ready yet.

29:04.005 --> 29:05.046
It's mine!

29:05.755 --> 29:06.755
It's my father.

29:07.588 --> 29:08.505
Hi, Dad.

29:08.588 --> 29:10.088
How are you, sweetheart?

29:10.171 --> 29:12.421
Good. We're having dinner with friends.

29:13.338 --> 29:17.296
I'l be quick. I just spoke to Weiss.
He can operate on you next month.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.046
I'll send you his number.

29:19.130 --> 29:20.421
Thanks, Dad.

29:20.505 --> 29:22.796
-Kiss Mom for me?
-Yes.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.213
-Bye, sweetheart.
-Bye.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.838
What's up?

29:36.005 --> 29:38.213
What's this operation?

29:40.046 --> 29:42.213
It's nothing serious.

29:45.338 --> 29:47.505
It's an augmentation mammoplasty.

29:50.338 --> 29:52.046
I'm having my boobs done.

29:54.171 --> 29:55.088
I need wine.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.255
You? A boob job?

30:00.921 --> 30:02.213
Yes... me.

30:03.755 --> 30:05.546
Why? You're a shrink.

30:06.546 --> 30:07.380
So what?

30:07.463 --> 30:08.505
She's right.

30:08.588 --> 30:12.046
Therapists don't get boob jobs.

30:12.130 --> 30:13.588
Yeah, it's weird.

30:14.130 --> 30:15.671
What do they get done?

30:16.130 --> 30:16.963
Nothing.

30:17.338 --> 30:18.921
Nothing!

30:19.338 --> 30:20.796
Why not, if I want to?

30:20.880 --> 30:22.046
That's the problem.

30:23.213 --> 30:24.463
You shouldn't want to.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.005
You're a shrink!

30:26.546 --> 30:28.963
Yeah, as a shrink, you should
accept your body, right?

30:29.046 --> 30:29.963
Exactly.

30:30.046 --> 30:32.588
A woman who gets her boobs done
doesn't accept herself?

30:32.671 --> 30:33.546
No.

30:35.213 --> 30:37.713
Listen, I accept my entire body,
except my breasts.

30:41.296 --> 30:43.546
Why isn't Vincent doing the operation?

30:44.171 --> 30:46.213
I bet you have to pay the other guy.

30:46.296 --> 30:49.296
Because Daddy wants what's best
for his precious little girl.

30:49.380 --> 30:52.421
Dr. Weiss of Geneva, surgeon to the stars!

30:52.838 --> 30:55.213
Not me, who sucks fat
from cashiers and hairdressers.

30:56.255 --> 30:59.380
Her father dreamed she'd marry
a cardiologist, a neurologist...

30:59.463 --> 31:01.671
Here we go again
with your ridiculous complex.

31:01.755 --> 31:02.755
Am I wrong?

31:03.421 --> 31:06.255
A husband can't operate
on his wife's breasts.

31:06.338 --> 31:07.505
It's obvious.

31:08.213 --> 31:10.838
You wouldn't come to me for therapy.

31:13.255 --> 31:15.546
You don't even believe in what I do.

31:15.630 --> 31:16.671
I don't disagree.

31:16.755 --> 31:19.213
-Stop it.
-In fact, our jobs have a lot in common.

31:19.671 --> 31:23.046
You fix heads, I fix asses and tits.
All to make people feel better.

31:23.130 --> 31:25.463
Except with you, it takes years.
With me, two hours.

31:25.546 --> 31:27.546
I agree, it's not as chic,
but it is faster.

31:30.505 --> 31:32.421
Calm down! It's just the broccoli.

31:33.588 --> 31:36.255
Wait... There's no more...
I'll get more wine.

31:37.005 --> 31:38.921
Anyone want more white? Yes?

31:39.005 --> 31:41.005
All right, I'll get it.

31:44.380 --> 31:45.296
Broccoli?

31:48.671 --> 31:50.505
We're stopping at McDonald's afterwards.

31:56.046 --> 31:58.296
Benoît, I have a small problem.

31:58.796 --> 31:59.880
I need your help.

31:59.963 --> 32:02.130
When you use my full name,
it's not a good sign.

32:02.213 --> 32:04.213
No, don't worry, it's no big deal.

32:04.588 --> 32:05.963
Well, kind of.

32:07.255 --> 32:11.296
Okay... I have friend.
Every night, she sends me...

32:12.130 --> 32:13.088
What?

32:13.546 --> 32:14.380
A photo of her.

32:14.963 --> 32:16.588
-I see.
-No, you don't.

32:16.671 --> 32:17.755
-I can imagine.
-No!

32:18.296 --> 32:21.713
It's not what you think.
It's a private joke. Just for laughs.

32:21.796 --> 32:23.046
-For laughs? Okay.
-Yeah.

32:23.130 --> 32:25.255
I bet your wife won't laugh.

32:25.338 --> 32:27.796
Precisely. That's where you come in.

32:29.130 --> 32:30.046
I don't follow.

32:30.755 --> 32:32.130
We have the same phone.

32:33.213 --> 32:35.421
We swap them until I get the photo.

32:35.505 --> 32:37.588
Then I'm the sleazebag. Thanks.

32:37.671 --> 32:40.088
-What do you care? You're single.
-No, I'm not!

32:41.671 --> 32:43.130
I'm not single anymore.

32:43.213 --> 32:44.796
Tonight, you are.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.838
I barely know this girl.
I've never met her.

32:49.546 --> 32:50.380
Benoît.

32:51.630 --> 32:53.505
We've been friends since third grade.

32:54.630 --> 32:55.755
You have to help me.

32:57.338 --> 32:59.046
Charlotte is also my friend.

32:59.130 --> 33:02.713
Not for as long, but still...
It makes me uncomfortable.

33:02.796 --> 33:03.713
Uncomfortable?

33:04.838 --> 33:08.046
I'm asking to help avoid a disaster
and you're uncomfortable?

33:08.505 --> 33:11.130
A family torn apart,
kids being shunted back and forth.

33:11.213 --> 33:13.380
Screaming and crying, thanks to who?

33:13.463 --> 33:15.088
Mister Uncomfortable.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.380
What kind of photo?

33:19.463 --> 33:21.630
It's nothing... really.

33:23.921 --> 33:24.838
Come on, Ben.

33:27.671 --> 33:28.963
-No.
-What?

33:30.171 --> 33:31.005
No.

33:32.255 --> 33:33.963
-Ben?
-No, no way.

33:34.046 --> 33:34.880
What?

33:36.046 --> 33:36.880
Ben!

33:38.046 --> 33:38.880
Come back!

33:42.463 --> 33:44.130
Let's rent a yurt.

33:44.213 --> 33:45.130
-A yurt?
-Yeah.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.213
Yeah. Or we could go to Normandy.

33:47.296 --> 33:50.546
-No, I've had enough of...
-Let's do something different for once!

33:50.630 --> 33:54.046
-Rain jackets in August, no thanks.
-What do you want me to do in a yurt?

33:54.130 --> 33:55.171
Wait, I'll serve you.

33:55.255 --> 33:59.505
But... staying in a yurt
is a fun activity.

33:59.588 --> 34:01.630
We can have fun elsewhere.

34:01.713 --> 34:03.588
How about a cruise on a canal boat?

34:03.671 --> 34:05.963
-What the hell am I going to do there?
-Great idea!

34:06.046 --> 34:07.630
But Marie gets seasick.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.963
If I'm pregnant this summer, so will I.

34:21.380 --> 34:24.546
I didn't get enough bread,
but usually you guys never eat it all.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.630
Usually, we eat everything else.

34:39.380 --> 34:40.588
What's up?

34:41.838 --> 34:43.713
I don't know if I can tell you.

34:45.713 --> 34:48.671
But Charlotte,
you know you can tell me anything.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.963
Yeah. You're right.

34:52.588 --> 34:53.463
Here it is.

34:54.546 --> 34:55.505
Your husband...

34:57.796 --> 34:59.713
Your husband is seeing a shrink!

35:02.171 --> 35:03.338
-Vincent?
-Yes.

35:03.838 --> 35:06.963
Don't say a word.
I swore to Marco I wouldn't tell you.

35:08.796 --> 35:09.713
That's me!

35:11.880 --> 35:12.921
Steve Jobs?

35:16.213 --> 35:18.421
It's mine!

35:20.046 --> 35:21.005
Steve Jobs.

35:22.963 --> 35:24.546
It's okay, it's just work.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.171
Well, answer it.

35:29.338 --> 35:30.171
Answer it.

35:31.380 --> 35:32.713
I told you, it's work.

35:32.796 --> 35:34.838
It'll be boring and long, it's not...

35:35.213 --> 35:37.713
If we start cheating, I'm out.

35:37.796 --> 35:38.713
Yeah.

35:40.546 --> 35:42.338
Somebody's suspicious.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.005
Hello?

35:51.171 --> 35:52.463
Hello, Jean-Yves?

35:54.130 --> 35:54.963
Mrs. Courtois?

35:55.046 --> 35:57.421
Yes. Good evening, Jean-Yves.

35:57.505 --> 35:58.921
Good evening, Mrs. Courtois.

35:59.005 --> 36:02.213
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I'm on holiday tomorrow.

36:02.546 --> 36:03.880
Your computer is ready.

36:04.671 --> 36:07.130
-Thank you so much.
-I'll leave it at reception.

36:07.213 --> 36:09.046
Perfect. I'll get it Monday.

36:09.546 --> 36:11.046
-Yes.
-And...

36:11.130 --> 36:13.296
Enjoy your holiday. Where are you going?

36:13.755 --> 36:17.171
To the beach with my wife.
It's the honeymoon we never had.

36:17.588 --> 36:18.921
Good luck.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.088
Yes, thanks.

36:22.796 --> 36:24.338
Bye now.

36:25.130 --> 36:27.171
There you go. Happy now?

36:29.296 --> 36:30.255
Steve Jobs?

36:31.046 --> 36:32.630
He's the IT guy.

36:33.963 --> 36:35.338
Zidane sounded wrong.

36:40.546 --> 36:43.296
Speaking of football...
"Pascal: game tomorrow."

36:43.380 --> 36:44.921
Yup. I got it too.

36:45.005 --> 36:46.005
I got the same.

36:47.130 --> 36:49.796
We're playing tomorrow?
I didn't get anything.

36:53.088 --> 36:56.213
-Maybe you don't have any signal.
-Yeah, it's pretty weak here.

36:56.296 --> 36:57.505
Who's your provider?

36:59.671 --> 37:01.046
You kicked me off the team?

37:01.130 --> 37:03.088
-Don't look at me.
-Of course not!

37:03.713 --> 37:05.130
You really are assholes.

37:05.463 --> 37:08.963
You only call me when you need
a goalkeeper. I'm the only pro here.

37:09.046 --> 37:09.880
Pro?

37:10.296 --> 37:11.880
I'm a gym teacher, aren't I?

37:12.505 --> 37:13.588
Of course.

37:14.630 --> 37:16.546
Reboot the phone. That might help.

37:17.963 --> 37:20.838
Or hold it higher.
You might pick up the network.

37:26.505 --> 37:27.421
What?

37:32.838 --> 37:34.963
-"Carole Dispatcher."
-Not again!

37:35.046 --> 37:36.630
"Call me. Super urgent!!!"

37:37.338 --> 37:38.838
With three exclamation marks!

37:38.921 --> 37:40.255
Who is this Carole

37:40.338 --> 37:43.088
who you have to call back super urgently?

37:43.171 --> 37:44.255
The taxi dispatcher.

37:44.880 --> 37:47.380
"Car needed at the corner of St. Paul's
in ten minutes."

37:47.463 --> 37:49.088
Well, call her back then.

37:49.171 --> 37:52.005
That's the game, isn't it?
I had to answer Steve Jobs.

37:52.088 --> 37:54.171
Time-out. Really...

37:54.255 --> 37:56.171
No, there is no time-out!

37:56.255 --> 37:59.005
-She'll ruin our weekend. Seriously.
-Yeah, exactly.

37:59.088 --> 38:01.380
-You're all cheating. I'm done.
-Hey!

38:01.463 --> 38:02.713
Come on, Marco.

38:02.796 --> 38:05.880
If she needs me to work,
I'll have to leave right now.

38:05.963 --> 38:07.421
-You see?
-Okay, time-out.

38:07.505 --> 38:09.255
Too bad. We wanted to meet Carole.

38:09.338 --> 38:11.421
With three exclamation marks.
Pass the bread?

38:11.505 --> 38:13.838
Honestly, you'd all have been
disappointed.

38:13.921 --> 38:15.463
She's really trashy.

38:15.546 --> 38:18.088
Horrible tattoos with fake boobs.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.171
Thanks a lot!

38:19.838 --> 38:21.005
What I mean is...

38:21.380 --> 38:23.046
Shit, sorry. I...

38:23.380 --> 38:25.046
They're not just fake...

38:25.671 --> 38:27.088
I mean, they're fake,

38:27.171 --> 38:29.171
but they're...

38:29.255 --> 38:30.838
Hers are...

38:30.921 --> 38:32.588
they're too fake.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.838
What's wrong with him?

38:36.921 --> 38:37.838
Stomach flu?

38:37.921 --> 38:40.630
Are you ready? Go! One two, one two...

38:42.630 --> 38:43.838
What are you doing?

38:43.921 --> 38:45.921
It's a new app. "Fizz Up."

38:46.880 --> 38:48.255
A 20-week training program.

38:48.338 --> 38:50.088
Twenty seconds whenever it beeps.

38:50.380 --> 38:51.838
Do you lose 20 kilos?

38:51.921 --> 38:53.005
No, eight.

38:53.088 --> 38:54.296
That's a rip off!

38:54.380 --> 38:55.880
Twenty weeks? When did you start?

38:55.963 --> 38:56.796
Yesterday.

38:56.880 --> 38:59.380
Sorry, I have no choice. Every beep.

38:59.463 --> 39:00.755
Even at night?

39:00.838 --> 39:01.963
If it beeps, yes.

39:02.046 --> 39:03.963
Just turn it off. Who will know?

39:04.046 --> 39:05.171
See you later.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.838
No, I can't.

39:07.505 --> 39:08.546
I don't cheat.

39:08.630 --> 39:10.671
-I would, if I were you.
-Me too.

39:10.755 --> 39:12.963
Twenty weeks, day and night,
what a nightmare.

39:13.046 --> 39:16.005
You know, with liposuction,
you can sleep at night.

39:17.171 --> 39:18.255
I don't like needles.

39:19.755 --> 39:22.005
I want to be a credible gym teacher.

39:22.088 --> 39:25.296
And then maybe the football texts
won't get lost anymore.

39:26.046 --> 39:28.546
Does your app know
how much foie gras you ate?

39:28.630 --> 39:30.546
Quality food isn't fattening.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.505
Well, in that case, help yourself!

39:34.046 --> 39:35.463
I'm such an idiot!

39:35.546 --> 39:38.713
At least it's not biodynamic.
It would burn a hole.

39:38.796 --> 39:40.380
Come to the kitchen.

39:40.463 --> 39:41.463
Don't worry about it.

39:41.546 --> 39:43.588
-No, it'll stain.
-I'll just change shirts.

39:43.671 --> 39:46.380
Come on. It'll stain if I don't wet it.

39:46.463 --> 39:47.713
-Okay.
-Come on.

39:47.796 --> 39:48.713
She's so clumsy.

39:48.796 --> 39:50.630
Bye-bye, tailor-made shirt!

39:53.130 --> 39:53.963
It's done.

39:54.671 --> 39:55.505
What?

39:58.671 --> 40:00.505
No! I said no.

40:01.171 --> 40:02.005
Too late.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.088
I said no!

40:07.338 --> 40:09.296
Hey! This summer...

40:09.880 --> 40:11.713
white water rafting in Ardèche.

40:12.171 --> 40:14.546
-Don't be silly, Marco. You can't swim.
-True.

40:15.088 --> 40:16.255
I'm so clumsy.

40:17.213 --> 40:18.046
I'm sorry.

40:33.921 --> 40:35.296
Why didn't you tell me?

40:36.963 --> 40:37.796
About what?

40:39.588 --> 40:40.880
About the shrink.

40:49.505 --> 40:51.171
Who is it? Do I know them?

40:51.505 --> 40:52.338
No.

40:56.005 --> 40:57.463
How long have you been going?

40:59.255 --> 41:00.088
Six months.

41:06.296 --> 41:07.171
Are you mad?

41:07.255 --> 41:08.130
No.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.046
Yes, a little.

41:18.963 --> 41:20.213
What made you decide?

41:22.171 --> 41:23.296
I don't know...

41:23.921 --> 41:24.838
Lots of things.

41:29.130 --> 41:30.880
We can't become like Ken and Barbie.

41:32.713 --> 41:34.963
You, with plastic tits,
and me, with no balls.

41:44.463 --> 41:45.880
I'll go and get changed.

41:49.796 --> 41:51.796
Kiss me before you eat that.

41:51.880 --> 41:52.880
It's good. Taste it.

41:53.213 --> 41:55.046
-It's good.
-No, it smells weird.

41:57.588 --> 41:58.421
Pardon.

41:59.588 --> 42:02.338
-It's heavy and fatty.
-It's fatty?

42:02.421 --> 42:04.963
Oh, yeah, very fatty.
Really hard to digest.

42:05.713 --> 42:08.463
-Everything okay, Marie?
-Yeah, he's just changing his shirt.

42:08.546 --> 42:09.963
-Is it good?
-Yeah, it's great.

42:10.046 --> 42:11.880
It's good, but it's a little...

42:12.255 --> 42:13.921
It's a bit too fatty for me.

42:14.671 --> 42:16.630
-Whose is it?
-It's yours, Ben.

42:17.671 --> 42:19.921
-A photo!
-"X"?

42:20.005 --> 42:21.046
Who's "X"?

42:21.130 --> 42:23.880
-How mysterious.
-Yeah, who is this "X"?

42:25.380 --> 42:29.046
Just a work colleague
from St. Genevieve's.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.671
She's not a teacher, she's a...

42:32.630 --> 42:35.963
She works in admin,
but she's not tenured.

42:36.046 --> 42:37.588
I think she's in training.

42:37.921 --> 42:41.130
And... she sends me photos... sometimes.

42:41.213 --> 42:43.671
Not... not very often.

42:44.421 --> 42:45.255
Let's see.

42:45.338 --> 42:47.796
No, they're boring. I never open them.

42:47.880 --> 42:50.296
Come on. Play the game, Ben.
Show us the picture.

42:50.380 --> 42:53.046
-Show us the picture!
-We all want to see the photo!

42:53.546 --> 42:54.880
Even he doesn't look at them.

42:54.963 --> 42:56.880
Yeah, but we can look at it all together.

42:56.963 --> 42:58.588
-Show us!
-It's the rules!

42:59.088 --> 42:59.921
Show us!

43:00.005 --> 43:01.796
-Show us the picture.
-Show us!

43:03.630 --> 43:04.463
Holy shit!

43:04.546 --> 43:06.088
-Oh, wow!
-You'll break it.

43:06.171 --> 43:08.630
Show us what's on your phone!

43:09.005 --> 43:10.755
Oh, boy!

43:11.838 --> 43:13.380
-What?
-Way to go, "X"!

43:13.463 --> 43:14.296
Show us!

43:14.380 --> 43:16.171
You naughty boy!

43:16.255 --> 43:18.421
Look, how flexible she is!

43:18.505 --> 43:19.338
Show us!

43:19.421 --> 43:21.213
-Look how flexible she is!
-Yeah, I saw.

43:21.296 --> 43:22.296
Show me!

43:22.380 --> 43:24.130
Vincent!

43:24.213 --> 43:25.380
No, it's not for girls.

43:25.463 --> 43:27.963
Don't look. Vincent, come here!

43:28.046 --> 43:29.921
It's your specialty. Vincent!

43:30.005 --> 43:31.671
Let me see!

43:31.755 --> 43:34.546
-I want your opinion, what do you think?
-Holy cow!

43:34.630 --> 43:35.880
Come on, show us!

43:35.963 --> 43:38.296
I don't even know which way up it goes.

43:38.505 --> 43:41.171
-Let us see!
-It's not for girls!

43:41.255 --> 43:44.713
-Charlotte!
-They're going wild. Take it!

43:44.796 --> 43:45.713
They're insane!

43:46.213 --> 43:47.755
Oh, my goodness!

43:48.588 --> 43:51.421
-This girl was your date tonight?
-No, that's not her.

43:51.505 --> 43:53.005
That's disgusting.

43:53.088 --> 43:55.088
Show Marco!

43:55.171 --> 43:56.630
I saw it, Charlotte.

43:56.713 --> 43:57.921
How do you even do that?

43:58.005 --> 44:00.130
That's impossible to do
with the stomach flu.

44:00.213 --> 44:01.546
I can't even do it.

44:03.171 --> 44:05.421
Definitely risky, in my medical opinion.

44:07.338 --> 44:08.171
Who is this "X"?

44:08.255 --> 44:09.380
-Isn't this fun?
-Nice.

44:09.463 --> 44:11.046
Who is this "X"?

44:11.130 --> 44:13.255
It's a private joke. For laughs.

44:13.338 --> 44:15.546
I just love your sense of humor.

44:16.338 --> 44:18.171
-To "X"!
-To X-Woman!

44:18.255 --> 44:20.421
I don't know her, but I like her.

44:20.505 --> 44:21.421
Definitely.

44:21.963 --> 44:24.046
-Will you try that for me?
-Come on, Marco!

44:24.630 --> 44:25.463
Yes.

44:26.671 --> 44:27.630
To "X."

44:31.755 --> 44:32.838
Whose is it?

44:34.088 --> 44:35.005
Yours.

44:35.838 --> 44:38.921
-What's with that ridiculous ringtone?
-I don't know.

44:39.255 --> 44:41.630
The kids must have been playing with it.

44:43.880 --> 44:47.755
It's... Julien. How nice.
He's asking how I am.

44:48.671 --> 44:49.921
Not very interesting.

44:51.671 --> 44:52.588
But nice.

44:53.046 --> 44:53.921
Okay...

44:55.338 --> 44:56.796
But who is Julien?

44:58.046 --> 45:00.838
Julien is a work colleague,
like your Jean-Yves.

45:01.421 --> 45:04.213
He's in the legal department.
A really nice guy.

45:05.213 --> 45:06.630
You met at the office party.

45:07.546 --> 45:09.005
You even spoke to him.

45:09.088 --> 45:10.005
You did!

45:10.630 --> 45:11.546
I don't remember.

45:11.630 --> 45:12.796
That's the problem.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.921
You never remember. It's not easy.

45:15.005 --> 45:17.046
And why does he want to know
how you are?

45:17.130 --> 45:18.046
At this hour?

45:18.380 --> 45:19.338
Because...

45:19.421 --> 45:23.255
we argued this afternoon
over a stupid accounting issue.

45:23.963 --> 45:25.171
Which is it?

45:25.255 --> 45:26.588
Stupid or nice?

45:26.671 --> 45:28.213
Nice and stupid. Okay?

45:28.296 --> 45:30.505
It can be both, you know.

45:30.588 --> 45:33.713
I'll tell him I'm at dinner with friends
and we'll talk on Monday.

45:33.796 --> 45:35.963
-No big deal.
-Hang on...

45:36.046 --> 45:38.296
Why tell him where you are? Who cares?

45:38.380 --> 45:40.338
He's a guy from work you barely know.

45:40.421 --> 45:42.005
Just tell him you're sleeping.

45:42.463 --> 45:45.296
If you want to make up, don't lie.

45:45.380 --> 45:48.296
Especially when it's only 9:30 p.m.
It sounds fishy.

45:48.380 --> 45:49.338
Very odd.

45:49.421 --> 45:52.046
Who cares? He can tell the truth.

45:52.130 --> 45:53.338
Yeah, I'll tell the truth.

45:53.421 --> 45:54.255
No!

45:55.463 --> 45:57.296
-Ben!
-This guy's insane!

45:57.380 --> 45:59.005
What happened to privacy?

45:59.088 --> 46:00.755
It used to be, "Hi, how are you?"

46:00.838 --> 46:03.505
Now it's, "Hi, where are you?"
Who cares where we are?

46:03.588 --> 46:04.880
Leave us alone!

46:04.963 --> 46:07.171
Ben's right. He just asked how I was.

46:07.255 --> 46:08.296
Exactly!

46:09.213 --> 46:10.796
Where you are is your business.

46:13.796 --> 46:16.296
Those things are the death of privacy.

46:17.588 --> 46:21.671
We're willing victims,
losing our free will little by little.

46:21.755 --> 46:23.755
I totally agree with you.

46:23.838 --> 46:25.171
In fact, I won't answer him.

46:25.255 --> 46:26.588
-There.
-No, you won't answer!

46:26.671 --> 46:27.796
Because you are free!

46:28.380 --> 46:29.213
Whose is that?

46:29.296 --> 46:30.338
It's Vincent's.

46:30.421 --> 46:31.338
Vincent. SMS.

46:34.255 --> 46:35.463
I have an e-mail!

46:35.755 --> 46:37.463
Okay, but Vincent goes first.

46:40.296 --> 46:41.255
Okay...

46:46.088 --> 46:47.005
What?

46:56.796 --> 46:57.713
So?

47:05.921 --> 47:08.380
There's 30% off at the garden store
and I can't go.

47:09.255 --> 47:10.130
What an idiot.

47:11.588 --> 47:13.046
Your turn, Charlotte.

47:13.130 --> 47:13.963
No, wait!

47:15.213 --> 47:17.005
-Chill out!
-He's crazy.

47:17.296 --> 47:19.255
"Cyril says, 'Read last e-mail.'"

47:19.338 --> 47:20.630
It's Siri, not Cyril.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.088
I found one e-mail at 9:39 p.m.

47:24.171 --> 47:27.046
Senior Residence retirement home
sent you an e-mail

47:27.130 --> 47:28.880
regarding your application.

47:28.963 --> 47:33.171
It reads: "Madam, we confirm receipt
of your application

47:33.255 --> 47:35.380
to the Les Lilas residence for seniors.

47:35.463 --> 47:36.838
We will contact you shortly

47:36.921 --> 47:39.130
so you can take advantage
of the first free month

47:39.213 --> 47:41.713
upon confirmation of becoming a resident.

47:41.796 --> 47:44.546
Caroline Agranier,
Director of Les Lilas Senior Residence."

47:44.630 --> 47:45.921
Would you like to reply?

47:46.005 --> 47:47.505
-Would you like to reply?
-No.

47:48.296 --> 47:49.755
No!

47:55.880 --> 47:57.046
A senior residence?

47:57.130 --> 47:59.755
Who are these crazy people?

47:59.838 --> 48:01.671
Sending e-mails at this hour.

48:01.755 --> 48:02.588
What is it?

48:03.088 --> 48:04.130
A nursing home?

48:04.671 --> 48:05.505
I don't know.

48:07.213 --> 48:08.296
Yes, I do!

48:08.671 --> 48:13.046
Not last weekend, but last week,
I went there with a friend,

48:13.463 --> 48:17.296
a work colleague,
who wanted to move her mother there.

48:17.380 --> 48:19.255
So, I took a look around,

48:19.338 --> 48:22.130
and it was... so beautiful.

48:23.213 --> 48:25.296
I guess I asked for information.

48:25.880 --> 48:27.005
"Information"?

48:27.421 --> 48:29.338
Because they mentioned an application.

48:30.963 --> 48:32.630
You'd send my mother to a home?

48:32.713 --> 48:36.046
-It's not a home, okay?
-I don't care.

48:36.505 --> 48:38.755
-It's a residence.
-Stop it!

48:39.130 --> 48:40.838
This woman adores you.

48:41.921 --> 48:44.296
She manages everything, despite her hip.

48:44.713 --> 48:46.380
The house, the kids...

48:46.463 --> 48:47.630
-Yeah.
-Everything.

48:47.713 --> 48:49.505
And in return, she gets room and board.

48:49.588 --> 48:52.880
So what?
You want me to ask my mother to pay rent?

48:52.963 --> 48:53.880
Well, it's...

48:54.505 --> 48:55.838
-Yes.
-Thomas!

48:55.921 --> 48:57.130
And why not?

48:57.838 --> 48:59.088
She gets a pension.

48:59.171 --> 49:02.713
You know what we save each year
on babysitters thanks to her?

49:02.796 --> 49:05.963
You have no idea. But if you want,
we can do things differently.

49:06.046 --> 49:08.713
But in that case, no more ski holidays.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.005
Shoot, not the ski holiday!

49:11.796 --> 49:15.130
At least admit it's not the same
with her living at home!

49:19.213 --> 49:21.338
"Not the same"? In what way?

49:21.880 --> 49:23.421
In what way?

49:23.505 --> 49:24.546
Let me see...

49:24.630 --> 49:27.088
I can think of one in particular.

49:27.796 --> 49:29.213
Great! Go ahead.

49:29.296 --> 49:30.255
Stop this.

49:31.171 --> 49:33.130
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

49:34.588 --> 49:36.088
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

49:36.171 --> 49:37.005
No.

49:37.088 --> 49:38.588
-Yes.
-No!

49:38.671 --> 49:40.046
Yes, you do.

49:40.130 --> 49:41.130
I don't get it.

49:41.213 --> 49:42.130
-You do!
-I don't.

49:42.213 --> 49:43.046
Yes!

49:43.588 --> 49:44.421
No.

49:44.796 --> 49:45.671
Yes!

49:46.421 --> 49:47.421
Okay, I get it.

49:50.546 --> 49:52.963
You think because my mother
is living with us,

49:53.046 --> 49:55.588
that's the reason
we don't do that anymore?

49:56.380 --> 49:58.005
Yes, indeed I do.

49:58.546 --> 50:02.463
It's true, that subconsciously,
the proximity of the mother...

50:03.713 --> 50:05.421
can have a castrating effect.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.130
-It's common knowledge.
-Castrating.

50:10.213 --> 50:12.296
I can confirm. Castrating...

50:18.838 --> 50:20.338
Yeah, but, you know...

50:20.671 --> 50:24.838
I, for example, love my mother-in-law,
but I could never live with her.

50:25.505 --> 50:26.380
Same here.

50:26.921 --> 50:29.963
Even if my mother paid rent,
no way.

50:31.588 --> 50:34.255
Those modern nursing homes are great.
Four-star.

50:34.338 --> 50:36.463
It's not a nursing home!

50:36.963 --> 50:38.588
Yes, I know. Sorry.

50:39.130 --> 50:40.005
Sorry.

50:42.046 --> 50:42.880
And...

50:43.463 --> 50:45.671
Be honest. Your mother is a little...

50:47.130 --> 50:49.671
I mean, she isn't very...

50:50.880 --> 50:51.755
I mean...

50:52.463 --> 50:55.796
-You know her, she's your mother.
-Yes, but I'm not following you.

50:55.880 --> 50:58.088
Marco, when I was a kid, she scared me.

50:58.171 --> 51:00.546
-Exactly.
-She hit me harder than my own father.

51:00.630 --> 51:02.296
Those hands... That beard...

51:03.755 --> 51:06.505
I adore her. Everyone does.

51:06.588 --> 51:10.421
But you have to admit
she's a champion ball-buster.

51:10.880 --> 51:11.755
You too?

51:12.171 --> 51:13.838
No, but honestly...

51:13.921 --> 51:15.421
You say it yourself.

51:18.838 --> 51:20.505
She does have her temper...

51:20.588 --> 51:21.546
There we go.

51:21.630 --> 51:23.588
Amen! Thank you.

51:23.671 --> 51:24.588
Picture time?

51:24.671 --> 51:26.421
Oh, yeah, the photo!

51:26.838 --> 51:29.796
No, only Ben gets to take his phone.
The others stay on the table.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.088
No.

51:31.171 --> 51:34.338
You told me you didn't have any space.
You take too many pictures.

51:34.421 --> 51:36.296
Léa, can we use your phone?

51:36.380 --> 51:37.255
Sure.

51:37.338 --> 51:38.713
You take too many pictures.

51:38.796 --> 51:41.338
-Will it fit on your stick?
-Yeah.

51:42.213 --> 51:45.088
A spot opens up and you get an e-mail!
A new resident!

51:45.171 --> 51:47.838
-Exactly, it's always full!
-They've got it down.

51:47.921 --> 51:49.046
Always.

51:49.130 --> 51:51.755
Old people are the future.

51:53.380 --> 51:55.713
Squeeze together so we see the eclipse.

51:56.380 --> 51:57.213
One...

51:57.713 --> 51:58.546
two...

51:59.005 --> 51:59.838
three...

51:59.921 --> 52:00.921
YVAN
HI!

52:01.005 --> 52:03.546
-What does he want at this hour?
-I don't know.

52:04.171 --> 52:06.796
-Who is it?
-It's her ex. Léa, what does he want?

52:06.880 --> 52:08.880
I don't know, he just said, "Hi."

52:08.963 --> 52:11.213
-Come on, let's take this picture!
-Her ex?

52:11.296 --> 52:12.630
One, two...

52:12.713 --> 52:13.796
Thomas, smile!

52:13.880 --> 52:16.130
Calm down.
I don't give a shit about that guy.

52:16.213 --> 52:17.588
-Okay, let's go.
-It's her ex?

52:17.671 --> 52:19.130
-Yes, it's her ex.
-Come on.

52:19.213 --> 52:20.130
One,

52:20.213 --> 52:21.796
two, three...

52:21.880 --> 52:25.630
Why did you save him
by his first name, Yvan?"

52:26.380 --> 52:29.255
That's his name.
How else would I save him?

52:29.338 --> 52:31.255
First name, last name,
like everybody else.

52:31.338 --> 52:32.255
Oh, baby...

52:32.338 --> 52:34.713
You saved my brother as Pascal Auclair.

52:34.796 --> 52:36.838
You didn't put "brother-in-law" or Paco.

52:36.921 --> 52:39.796
Let it go. It's her ex.
What does "ex" mean?

52:39.880 --> 52:40.755
It means "ex."

52:40.838 --> 52:42.463
-Yeah.
-Or "sex."

52:43.421 --> 52:45.338
-He's unbelievable.
-Come on!

52:45.421 --> 52:48.421
In my opinion, exes are... dangerous.

52:48.505 --> 52:50.213
-Let's take the picture.
-Let's go.

52:50.296 --> 52:54.130
Especially if you dumped him.
It's his ego talking, not his heart.

52:54.213 --> 52:55.088
Okay... one...

52:55.171 --> 52:56.213
Who dumped who?

52:57.088 --> 52:58.213
I dumped him. There.

52:58.296 --> 53:00.463
So, it's his ego. He won't give up.

53:00.546 --> 53:02.796
Stop it. I know what you're up to.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.671
-Are we taking this picture or not?
-It's up to Ben.

53:05.755 --> 53:06.880
Ben, are you ready?

53:06.963 --> 53:08.130
He's kidding, right?

53:08.213 --> 53:10.088
Let's go. One, two...

53:10.171 --> 53:11.255
Smile, Thomas!

53:11.338 --> 53:13.546
I'm cool. The guy's harmless.

53:13.630 --> 53:14.463
One...

53:15.046 --> 53:16.671
Are we taking this picture?

53:18.463 --> 53:21.505
One, two, three...

53:21.588 --> 53:24.171
YVAN
I'M IN THE MOOD TO FUCK

53:24.505 --> 53:25.421
Son of a bitch!

53:26.630 --> 53:27.713
I swear, I'll kill him.

53:28.046 --> 53:29.630
I don't care. He's dead.

53:29.713 --> 53:30.921
-My love...
-I'll kill him!

53:31.005 --> 53:32.546
It's not what you think.

53:32.630 --> 53:33.838
What is this text?

53:33.921 --> 53:35.421
It's not me he wants to...

53:35.505 --> 53:37.546
So what is it? A group text?

53:38.088 --> 53:39.213
So what is it?

53:39.296 --> 53:41.255
Stop laughing, damn it!

53:41.338 --> 53:43.755
-He's right, it's not very nice.
-Okay, I'm listening.

53:43.838 --> 53:47.296
Yvan has been seeing this girl
for a few months.

53:47.380 --> 53:51.130
It's just sex for her.
So he pretends it's the same for him.

53:51.213 --> 53:53.088
-So what? I don't get it.
-Well...

53:53.171 --> 53:56.171
He pretends he doesn't care,
but the truth is he's crazy about her.

53:56.255 --> 53:59.505
He doesn't know how to tell her.
It's making him sick as a dog.

54:00.421 --> 54:02.880
He should call a vet, not my wife.

54:04.171 --> 54:05.630
Marco, stop laughing!

54:05.713 --> 54:07.630
Honestly... baby...

54:07.713 --> 54:09.713
Come back here, we're taking the picture!

54:09.796 --> 54:10.880
We'll do it later.

54:11.463 --> 54:12.421
A vet!

54:12.505 --> 54:13.838
What's wrong with you?

54:14.546 --> 54:16.588
Why are you losing it over Yvan?

54:17.588 --> 54:18.838
What about the picture?

54:21.005 --> 54:22.796
We'll never take it.

54:23.380 --> 54:24.713
I'll call him now.

54:24.796 --> 54:26.796
You don't have to. I don't give a shit.

54:26.880 --> 54:29.046
-I do.
-If you think I'm jealous, then you're...

54:29.130 --> 54:31.880
Less than an hour before the moon
completely disappears.

54:31.963 --> 54:33.505
Many are getting ready…

54:36.463 --> 54:39.421
Thanks for calling. Sorry to bother you,
but it was urgent.

54:39.505 --> 54:42.296
-Did she call?
-She invited me over.

54:42.380 --> 54:44.130
Don't go. It'll be worse.

54:44.630 --> 54:46.671
It can't be any worse. I'm obsessed.

54:46.755 --> 54:48.963
It's making me sick, physically sick.

54:49.296 --> 54:50.630
I think I'll go.

54:50.713 --> 54:53.046
Why did you call me
if you've already decided to go?

54:53.130 --> 54:54.505
Who else can I call?

54:56.713 --> 54:59.380
Okay, well...
I don't know what to tell you, Yvan.

55:00.046 --> 55:02.755
Well... enjoy your evening.

55:02.838 --> 55:04.088
Thanks.

55:04.171 --> 55:05.296
Okay. Bye.

55:06.630 --> 55:07.713
Satisfied?

55:08.796 --> 55:09.963
Does he call often?

55:10.880 --> 55:12.671
-Occasionally.
-Meaning?

55:14.005 --> 55:16.963
-Whenever he's in the mood to...
-I get it. Thanks.

55:17.713 --> 55:20.963
When he calls me in tears,
what should I do? Hang up on him?

55:21.046 --> 55:23.546
I don't give a shit.
Give him Marie's number.

55:23.630 --> 55:25.421
He needs a shrink, not his ex.

55:25.505 --> 55:27.880
Here's the cheese platter.
Come sit down.

55:27.963 --> 55:29.088
Fromaggi!

55:29.588 --> 55:30.838
You're really a pain.

55:31.463 --> 55:33.130
I thought you were allergic to milk?

55:33.213 --> 55:36.546
I know medically it's weird,
but I'm not allergic to cheese.

55:36.630 --> 55:38.546
Maybe it's the fermentation process or...

55:38.630 --> 55:41.213
Medically speaking,
the diagnosis is simple.

55:41.296 --> 55:42.130
You're annoying.

55:42.213 --> 55:43.296
You're wrong.

55:43.380 --> 55:45.005
-Yes, you are.
-That's not it.

55:46.296 --> 55:48.380
-Charlotte, what are you... I'll do it.
-What?

55:48.463 --> 55:50.213
-I'll do it, sit down.
-I'm fine.

55:50.296 --> 55:51.671
I'll clear the dishes.

55:51.755 --> 55:52.755
Sit down.

55:54.255 --> 55:55.755
-Honestly.
-I'm fine!

55:55.838 --> 55:58.088
Let me tell you something.
Your Yvan...

55:58.588 --> 55:59.838
wants to fuck you.

55:59.921 --> 56:01.921
But... that's ridiculous.

56:02.005 --> 56:04.296
I'm not in contact with any of my exes.

56:04.380 --> 56:05.838
They don't want to talk to you.

56:05.921 --> 56:07.838
Stop. I'm being serious.

56:08.505 --> 56:11.880
If it bothers you this much, I'll tell him
to stop calling. Is that better?

56:12.546 --> 56:13.671
Yes, it would be.

56:13.755 --> 56:15.380
Oh... I think it's absurd

56:15.463 --> 56:18.588
you can't talk to a friend
because your husband doesn't trust you.

56:18.671 --> 56:21.713
What? That has nothing to do with it!
I trust her.

56:21.796 --> 56:22.963
I don't trust him.

56:23.296 --> 56:25.505
I know these kinds of guys.
I can sniff them out.

56:25.588 --> 56:27.296
-He's a horndog.
-Why do you say that?

56:27.380 --> 56:30.005
-He seems perfectly nice.
-He is.

56:30.713 --> 56:33.130
Is he the one who lives in Nantes?

56:33.213 --> 56:36.130
Nantes...
Isn't that where you dream of living?

56:36.463 --> 56:37.338
He's right!

56:37.421 --> 56:40.338
You said so when we dicussed Ben's job.

56:40.421 --> 56:44.713
You said you'd love to live there,
that Nantes was a great city. Explain!

56:51.380 --> 56:53.505
Fine, but it may be painful for you.

56:53.838 --> 56:55.755
Are you sure you want the truth?

56:56.796 --> 56:58.463
Yes, I'm sure.

57:02.463 --> 57:05.130
Your two best friends
are just messing with you.

57:06.963 --> 57:09.213
No, he doesn't live in Nantes, baby!

57:09.296 --> 57:10.630
You assholes.

57:11.505 --> 57:12.671
You're such a jerk.

57:12.755 --> 57:14.630
Oh, no! That's full of germs!

57:14.713 --> 57:16.630
-I'm sorry, my love.
-Have some cheese.

57:16.713 --> 57:18.463
Yes! Cheese!

57:33.588 --> 57:35.880
The guy says, "I started a business."

57:35.963 --> 57:38.713
His friend says, "What kind?
You suck at everything."

57:39.421 --> 57:43.671
He says, "I invented this thing
that turns shit into butter."

57:43.755 --> 57:44.880
That's not it!

57:44.963 --> 57:46.171
Let me finish!

57:46.255 --> 57:48.588
-Stop it!
-There's no punchline.

57:48.671 --> 57:50.630
-It's a joke.
-Phone!

57:51.463 --> 57:52.296
It's Margot.

57:52.380 --> 57:53.588
So answer.

57:56.130 --> 57:57.755
Hi, honey. Everything okay?

57:58.171 --> 57:59.255
Yeah, I'm fine.

58:00.005 --> 58:01.546
Can I talk to you?

58:03.588 --> 58:04.796
Sure, I'm listening.

58:07.296 --> 58:13.421
I don't know how to say this,
but Tristan's parents are out tonight.

58:14.588 --> 58:18.338
He wants me to leave the party
and go home with him.

58:19.421 --> 58:20.713
Just the two of us.

58:21.796 --> 58:23.130
And...

58:24.005 --> 58:25.005
Well, you...

58:25.505 --> 58:26.505
You get it?

58:30.505 --> 58:31.421
Dad?

58:33.005 --> 58:34.463
And how do you feel?

58:37.838 --> 58:39.505
I don't know what to do.

58:40.255 --> 58:42.130
Because I wasn't expecting it.

58:42.588 --> 58:44.505
Well, not tonight, in any case.

58:44.588 --> 58:50.713
And... the thing is, if I say no,
it'll make it awkward between us.

58:55.463 --> 58:56.713
What do I do?

58:59.671 --> 59:02.796
If you're only going to avoid
making things awkward...

59:04.838 --> 59:05.921
then don't go.

59:07.630 --> 59:08.838
You have to be sure.

59:10.296 --> 59:11.921
I... don't know what to do.

59:12.671 --> 59:18.005
Because this morning,
when you gave me the box of condoms,

59:18.088 --> 59:20.963
I was really uncomfortable.

59:25.921 --> 59:28.630
You don't necessarily
have to use them tonight.

59:29.380 --> 59:32.338
I think that you sensed it.

59:32.421 --> 59:35.171
And Mom totally missed it, as usual.

59:40.046 --> 59:40.880
Dad?

59:43.088 --> 59:44.255
Yes, honey.

59:44.921 --> 59:45.963
What do I do?

59:49.130 --> 59:50.046
You know...

59:52.338 --> 59:55.171
it's not easy for a father
to advise his daughter on...

59:56.171 --> 59:57.713
on something so important.

59:58.630 --> 1:00:00.296
If it was just about me, I'd say,

1:00:01.005 --> 1:00:02.005
"Don't do it.

1:00:03.005 --> 1:00:04.005
Don't ever do it.

1:00:05.588 --> 1:00:07.296
Stay my little girl forever."

1:00:09.546 --> 1:00:10.880
But that's impossible.

1:00:13.088 --> 1:00:14.921
So, you need to decide for yourself.

1:00:17.088 --> 1:00:19.005
You'll never forget that moment.

1:00:20.130 --> 1:00:22.046
So make sure it's a good memory.

1:00:25.921 --> 1:00:27.463
It may sound corny, but...

1:00:29.130 --> 1:00:30.796
there's only one first time.

1:00:32.088 --> 1:00:33.463
So if deep down,

1:00:34.171 --> 1:00:35.421
you're not sure,

1:00:36.630 --> 1:00:37.630
don't do it.

1:00:40.588 --> 1:00:42.588
There will be other moments, believe me.

1:00:45.546 --> 1:00:46.380
Yeah.

1:00:48.671 --> 1:00:49.838
Thanks for being there.

1:00:49.921 --> 1:00:52.380
Mom would have just yelled at me.

1:00:52.463 --> 1:00:54.088
She never understands anything.

1:00:54.171 --> 1:00:55.796
She never listens to me anyway.

1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:58.213
Of course she listens to you, but...

1:00:59.546 --> 1:01:01.880
You know, it's not easy for her either.

1:01:02.463 --> 1:01:05.130
She sometimes feels like
you don't understand her either.

1:01:05.213 --> 1:01:08.921
I think you love her too much
to see how annoying she really is.

1:01:10.421 --> 1:01:12.505
Okay, he's here. I'm hanging up.

1:01:12.588 --> 1:01:13.546
-Margot.
-Thanks.

1:01:31.838 --> 1:01:33.505
You did really well.

1:01:35.546 --> 1:01:37.505
Your shrink seems to be helping.

1:01:42.338 --> 1:01:43.505
It's okay.

1:01:45.338 --> 1:01:46.880
I know you all know.

1:01:48.796 --> 1:01:51.088
It's true, you did really well.

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:57.505
Oh, yeah, it's yours.

1:01:57.921 --> 1:01:58.755
Oh, yeah.

1:02:01.713 --> 1:02:03.088
JULIEN
SO...? ANSWER ME.

1:02:03.171 --> 1:02:04.296
He's pretty insistent.

1:02:05.338 --> 1:02:06.338
What did he say?

1:02:06.755 --> 1:02:08.213
He said, "Answer me!"

1:02:09.588 --> 1:02:11.755
So answer. Let's get it over with.

1:02:11.838 --> 1:02:12.671
No.

1:02:14.296 --> 1:02:16.963
Marco, answer him.

1:02:25.463 --> 1:02:27.463
-We agreed not to.
-Enough, Ben.

1:02:27.546 --> 1:02:28.713
You made your point.

1:02:28.796 --> 1:02:30.130
Marco, answer him. Period.

1:02:30.213 --> 1:02:33.588
I am. "I'm out with friends.
See you Monday."

1:02:39.671 --> 1:02:42.046
When I was little, my mother would...

1:02:48.838 --> 1:02:50.546
-You prick.
-What?

1:02:50.630 --> 1:02:52.296
He's calling you a prick.

1:02:54.463 --> 1:02:56.463
Why is he being so agressive?

1:02:56.546 --> 1:02:58.546
I have no idea. How should I know?

1:03:00.046 --> 1:03:01.005
He's the prick.

1:03:01.463 --> 1:03:02.796
What can I say?

1:03:05.671 --> 1:03:06.505
JULIEN
HOME

1:03:06.588 --> 1:03:08.588
Go on then, ask him. He's calling.

1:03:09.921 --> 1:03:10.963
Go on, answer.

1:03:11.046 --> 1:03:12.671
No, he's a pain in the ass.

1:03:13.671 --> 1:03:14.880
Answer.

1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:21.213
Hello?

1:03:23.546 --> 1:03:25.505
You can drop the fake laryngitis.

1:03:26.421 --> 1:03:29.046
If you were really sick,
you wouldn't be out.

1:03:31.838 --> 1:03:33.088
I get it. Don't answer.

1:03:34.630 --> 1:03:38.755
You want to know what your problem is?
You're not sure you're into men.

1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:40.630
So fuck off.

1:03:58.671 --> 1:04:00.296
You don't actually think...

1:04:00.588 --> 1:04:02.296
Guys, this is crazy!

1:04:02.755 --> 1:04:03.713
You're scaring me.

1:04:03.796 --> 1:04:06.255
He's gay and he took a liking to me.

1:04:06.713 --> 1:04:09.838
I can't help it. It's awkward,
but there's nothing I can do.

1:04:13.546 --> 1:04:15.630
Did something happen with this guy?

1:04:19.338 --> 1:04:20.755
Did something happen?

1:04:21.255 --> 1:04:23.421
-Yes or no?
-Enough of this bullshit.

1:04:23.505 --> 1:04:26.588
Charlotte. I told you,
this guy is fantasizing.

1:04:26.671 --> 1:04:28.296
Help me out, guys, please.

1:04:28.380 --> 1:04:31.171
-Tell her.
-Yeah, it is true that fags--

1:04:31.255 --> 1:04:35.921
I mean, gays, always think straight guys
are a little gay, without knowing it.

1:04:36.005 --> 1:04:37.171
And... so...

1:04:37.796 --> 1:04:39.963
They try their luck.

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:42.963
That's a pretty homophobic statement.

1:04:43.046 --> 1:04:46.880
You don't just suddenly wake up gay.
There are precursory signs.

1:04:47.463 --> 1:04:48.755
That's what I meant.

1:04:48.838 --> 1:04:52.588
I remember, when he was a kid,
he often wore a dress to school.

1:04:52.671 --> 1:04:53.838
Cut it out.

1:04:56.046 --> 1:04:57.505
Ben, aren't I right?

1:05:01.005 --> 1:05:01.880
Marco.

1:05:05.546 --> 1:05:07.296
Did something happen with this guy?

1:05:07.380 --> 1:05:10.630
Charlotte, we've been married
for 15 years. It's me, your husband.

1:05:11.213 --> 1:05:12.421
Don't you recognize me?

1:05:13.296 --> 1:05:14.421
Charlotte, look at me.

1:05:15.421 --> 1:05:16.296
Look at me.

1:05:17.130 --> 1:05:18.921
Look at me, Charlotte!

1:05:20.463 --> 1:05:22.505
Seriously, can you see me with a guy?

1:05:22.838 --> 1:05:24.088
Can you? Yes or no?

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:27.713
Nothing's going on with this guy.

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:31.296
I swear on our children's lives.

1:05:34.088 --> 1:05:34.963
Okay.

1:05:45.671 --> 1:05:46.588
Here...

1:05:50.046 --> 1:05:52.171
He says he misses your lips.

1:05:57.963 --> 1:05:59.921
He swore on my children's lives.

1:06:01.213 --> 1:06:02.671
I married a monster.

1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:07.505
A monster!

1:06:25.213 --> 1:06:26.380
I'm at a loss for words.

1:06:26.463 --> 1:06:28.671
Don't say anything. It's better.

1:06:32.255 --> 1:06:33.213
Excuse me?

1:06:33.630 --> 1:06:34.796
What's with the tone?

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:36.880
-Are you going to start too?
-Nope.

1:06:37.963 --> 1:06:39.255
Ben, pass the salad.

1:06:43.838 --> 1:06:45.380
You have a problem?

1:06:45.463 --> 1:06:47.296
No. I don't have a problem.

1:06:48.213 --> 1:06:49.713
The cheese was very good.

1:06:51.505 --> 1:06:52.546
Stop it, Thomas.

1:06:53.921 --> 1:06:56.796
He's still the same guy,
your buddy you share everything with.

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:59.005
No, not everything, thank goodness!

1:06:59.088 --> 1:07:00.338
Cut the crap, Thomas.

1:07:01.005 --> 1:07:04.046
It's fine with me.
I have nothing against it.

1:07:04.130 --> 1:07:05.296
He's a free man.

1:07:05.380 --> 1:07:07.630
-You have nothing against it?
-Relax.

1:07:11.171 --> 1:07:12.463
What's the real issue?

1:07:12.546 --> 1:07:15.130
That you didn't know,
or that I might be a fag?

1:07:15.213 --> 1:07:18.338
Stop saying "gay". It doesn't work
in your meathead mouth.

1:07:18.421 --> 1:07:20.588
-In my what mouth?
-Meathead.

1:07:21.713 --> 1:07:23.130
Say that again.

1:07:23.213 --> 1:07:25.588
-In my what mouth?
-Thomas, calm down!

1:07:25.671 --> 1:07:27.588
-You want me to apologize?
-Yes, calm down.

1:07:27.671 --> 1:07:29.630
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

1:07:29.713 --> 1:07:32.880
He's lied to us for 35 years
and no one cares but me?

1:07:33.546 --> 1:07:36.421
If that makes me a meathead,
fine with me.

1:07:42.005 --> 1:07:44.130
...the earth's shadow is covering it.

1:07:44.213 --> 1:07:48.255
A rare phenomenon, where the moon
is at its closest point to the earth,

1:07:48.338 --> 1:07:50.546
perfectly aligned with the sun.

1:07:52.505 --> 1:07:56.421
Fag, fag, fag...

1:07:57.338 --> 1:07:59.380
I'm allowed to say it. He's my husband.

1:07:59.463 --> 1:08:03.255
Maybe he's telling the truth.
Maybe his colleague is fantasizing.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:07.921
Lots of my patients have those fantasies.

1:08:08.005 --> 1:08:10.713
Just because he waxes his chest
doesn't mean...

1:08:10.796 --> 1:08:12.380
How stupid are you?

1:08:12.463 --> 1:08:14.005
He misses his lips!

1:08:15.130 --> 1:08:16.588
It couldn't be clearer.

1:08:27.171 --> 1:08:28.963
How long has it been going on?

1:08:30.380 --> 1:08:33.713
-You're being ridiculous.
-How long has it been going on?

1:08:34.713 --> 1:08:35.630
Tell me.

1:08:42.921 --> 1:08:44.005
Not long.

1:08:51.338 --> 1:08:52.630
Okay, please...

1:08:53.838 --> 1:08:54.796
No.

1:09:00.005 --> 1:09:00.963
And before him?

1:09:02.963 --> 1:09:04.796
-What?
-How many before him?

1:09:05.796 --> 1:09:07.088
Nobody.

1:09:08.546 --> 1:09:09.671
Thanks for dinner.

1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:13.255
Why now?

1:09:16.630 --> 1:09:17.963
Come on, we're leaving.

1:09:18.046 --> 1:09:18.921
Good idea.

1:09:19.546 --> 1:09:21.255
We can check on the kids,

1:09:22.005 --> 1:09:23.630
since you swore on their lives.

1:09:25.713 --> 1:09:27.588
Charlotte, please, come with me.

1:09:28.088 --> 1:09:28.921
No.

1:09:29.505 --> 1:09:30.755
You can go home.

1:09:30.838 --> 1:09:32.046
I'm staying here.

1:09:33.796 --> 1:09:36.338
-Charlotte.
-Charlotte's staying right here.

1:09:41.755 --> 1:09:42.588
MAX JEWLERY

1:09:42.671 --> 1:09:45.713
-Who knows a Max Jewelry?
-It's mine. Leave it, Chacha.

1:09:46.921 --> 1:09:47.755
Leave it.

1:09:48.296 --> 1:09:49.421
Hello, Tom?

1:09:49.505 --> 1:09:50.963
Yup, I'll pass you over.

1:09:51.046 --> 1:09:52.671
No, don't do that! Don't!

1:09:52.755 --> 1:09:53.713
She's crazy.

1:09:54.630 --> 1:09:55.546
Yeah, Max?

1:09:55.630 --> 1:09:58.713
Don't you listen to your messages?
I've left you at least ten.

1:09:59.046 --> 1:10:02.505
Yeah, I know, but it's a bit complicated
tonight. I'll call you back.

1:10:02.588 --> 1:10:05.505
I was getting paranoid.
I thought it was about the necklace.

1:10:05.588 --> 1:10:06.671
Did she like it?

1:10:06.755 --> 1:10:07.963
Yeah, she loved it.

1:10:08.046 --> 1:10:08.880
I love it.

1:10:08.963 --> 1:10:10.421
-I told you to trust me.
-Yeah.

1:10:10.921 --> 1:10:12.046
It's not gold, but...

1:10:12.130 --> 1:10:15.130
Yeah, listen, can I call you later?
This isn't a good time.

1:10:15.213 --> 1:10:16.671
-Bye.
-Oh, okay.

1:10:16.755 --> 1:10:19.713
What about the earrings?
Did she like the earrings?

1:10:22.630 --> 1:10:24.005
Can I call you later?

1:10:24.088 --> 1:10:26.963
-You don't sound too sure.
-Listen, I'll call you back. Bye.

1:10:28.213 --> 1:10:29.671
Who liked the earrings?

1:10:29.755 --> 1:10:30.755
No one.

1:10:32.213 --> 1:10:34.380
What do you mean, "no one"?
Who were they for?

1:10:34.463 --> 1:10:35.380
For you.

1:10:35.963 --> 1:10:36.880
Where are they?

1:10:37.755 --> 1:10:39.338
I don't even have pierced ears.

1:10:40.171 --> 1:10:43.088
Yeah, I know.
That's why I never gave them to you.

1:10:43.713 --> 1:10:45.505
We should stop this game.

1:10:46.213 --> 1:10:47.171
Really.

1:10:50.796 --> 1:10:52.213
CAROLE DISPATCHER
HOME

1:10:55.171 --> 1:10:56.463
She never gives up.

1:11:00.838 --> 1:11:03.380
Are the earrings for her?
Miss Dispatcher?

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:05.838
Sweetheart, she wants me to work.

1:11:07.088 --> 1:11:07.921
That's it.

1:11:09.630 --> 1:11:10.755
No, give me that.

1:11:10.838 --> 1:11:12.755
Give me the phone, Léa!

1:11:12.838 --> 1:11:13.796
Put it down.

1:11:14.380 --> 1:11:16.546
-Are the earrings for her?
-Put it down.

1:11:16.630 --> 1:11:18.130
Come here. Give it to me.

1:11:18.671 --> 1:11:20.463
-Hello, Tom?
-Give it to me!

1:11:20.546 --> 1:11:21.380
Hello?

1:11:21.796 --> 1:11:22.630
Baby?

1:11:24.213 --> 1:11:26.130
My love, I need to see you soon.

1:11:28.046 --> 1:11:31.505
I'm freaking out. I bought a test
from the pharmacy and I got a blue X.

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:33.130
The box says that it's "positive."

1:11:33.963 --> 1:11:36.296
"Positive" means we're pregnant, right?

1:11:36.755 --> 1:11:37.588
Oh, no.

1:11:37.671 --> 1:11:38.505
Hello?

1:11:39.130 --> 1:11:40.130
Darling? Tom?

1:11:40.755 --> 1:11:42.296
Can you hear me? Hello?

1:11:49.213 --> 1:11:50.046
My love!

1:12:09.213 --> 1:12:11.171
Wait!

1:12:11.588 --> 1:12:12.671
Okay, go ahead.

1:12:12.963 --> 1:12:14.755
It's okay, let it out.

1:12:15.171 --> 1:12:18.088
-Forgive me, sweetheart, I...
-Fuck off! Asshole!

1:12:18.171 --> 1:12:19.796
Chacha, don't close the door!

1:12:20.838 --> 1:12:21.838
Open up, Chacha!

1:12:22.963 --> 1:12:24.546
My love. Léa!

1:12:24.630 --> 1:12:25.838
Get lost, Thomas!

1:12:25.921 --> 1:12:27.171
I'm sorry, my love.

1:12:32.130 --> 1:12:34.546
That bitch is pregnant
and I'm the one vomiting.

1:12:34.630 --> 1:12:37.046
Léa, please, open the door. Léa.

1:14:18.296 --> 1:14:19.338
But why?

1:14:20.088 --> 1:14:21.255
Why?

1:14:21.338 --> 1:14:24.130
We just got married.
We have sex every day.

1:14:24.421 --> 1:14:25.380
We're happy.

1:14:26.421 --> 1:14:28.630
-Why?
-I don't know why.

1:14:30.338 --> 1:14:31.755
I told you to get lost!

1:14:32.505 --> 1:14:34.255
I didn't want to get married.

1:14:34.338 --> 1:14:37.671
You told me we'd be happy. I trusted you.

1:14:39.630 --> 1:14:42.546
Why the hell is Carole involved
with her big tits?

1:14:45.588 --> 1:14:47.005
Go away, Thomas!

1:14:47.088 --> 1:14:48.630
It's me, Charlotte. Open up.

1:14:48.713 --> 1:14:49.963
You can get lost too!

1:14:50.046 --> 1:14:50.921
Open it.

1:14:53.588 --> 1:14:54.796
I told you to fuck off.

1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:57.296
You got a Facebook message.

1:14:59.171 --> 1:15:01.796
Someone wants to know
if you're wearing panties.

1:15:02.713 --> 1:15:03.963
I don't know him.

1:15:04.505 --> 1:15:05.505
We've never met.

1:15:05.588 --> 1:15:07.921
I've never met him, Marco!

1:15:08.380 --> 1:15:09.630
Never!

1:15:09.713 --> 1:15:10.796
I swear.

1:15:11.671 --> 1:15:13.338
On our children's lives?

1:15:13.421 --> 1:15:15.796
It's a game.
We send each other occasional messages.

1:15:16.296 --> 1:15:17.588
Games must be in fashion.

1:15:17.671 --> 1:15:20.671
I told you, I don't know him.
We've never even spoken.

1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:23.255
Call him. It seems like a good time.

1:15:23.338 --> 1:15:24.588
I can't call him.

1:15:24.671 --> 1:15:26.630
I can't call him here, right now.

1:15:27.046 --> 1:15:28.713
He has a life, a family...

1:15:29.546 --> 1:15:30.421
And you don't?

1:15:31.296 --> 1:15:33.380
I told you, it's nothing... really!

1:15:34.005 --> 1:15:35.255
Well... It's virtual.

1:15:35.505 --> 1:15:37.796
If it's nothing, just call him.

1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:39.296
He gave you his number.

1:15:40.921 --> 1:15:43.671
In March, for God's sake.
That's over six months ago.

1:15:43.755 --> 1:15:45.546
We've never called each other.

1:15:45.921 --> 1:15:47.838
Well, now you can finally meet.

1:15:49.713 --> 1:15:51.380
-You're a jackass.
-Hello?

1:15:52.338 --> 1:15:53.463
-Charlotte?
-Speak.

1:15:53.546 --> 1:15:54.671
-No.
-Is that you?

1:15:55.380 --> 1:15:56.463
-No.
-I'm sorry.

1:15:56.546 --> 1:15:58.130
I shouldn't have messaged you.

1:16:00.088 --> 1:16:00.921
Charlotte?

1:16:01.921 --> 1:16:02.755
Yes, it's me.

1:16:03.463 --> 1:16:04.380
What a surprise.

1:16:06.338 --> 1:16:07.546
I want to meet you.

1:16:09.255 --> 1:16:10.671
We had decided against it.

1:16:12.921 --> 1:16:15.130
But if you've changed your mind, we could.

1:16:15.630 --> 1:16:17.838
No, you're right.
I don't think it's a good idea.

1:16:17.921 --> 1:16:19.588
It's better that we don't meet.

1:16:19.671 --> 1:16:21.463
Sorry, but I have to hang up.

1:16:21.546 --> 1:16:22.796
Just one more second.

1:16:24.296 --> 1:16:25.713
You have a lovely voice.

1:16:32.671 --> 1:16:33.838
Just so I know...

1:16:34.630 --> 1:16:35.671
are you?

1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:37.796
Am I what?

1:16:38.296 --> 1:16:40.713
-Are you wearing panties or not?
-Marco...

1:16:41.463 --> 1:16:43.088
Why the hell do you care?

1:16:44.338 --> 1:16:45.796
If you're a fag.

1:16:46.296 --> 1:16:47.921
That doesn't stop me being curious.

1:16:48.421 --> 1:16:49.880
-Panties or no panties?
-Stop it.

1:16:49.963 --> 1:16:51.546
-Yes or no?
-Stop it, Marco!

1:16:51.630 --> 1:16:54.171
-Stop.
-Stop it.

1:17:06.338 --> 1:17:07.505
Look.

1:17:11.421 --> 1:17:12.296
Now you know.

1:17:17.338 --> 1:17:20.130
If you don't love me anymore,
why don't you leave me?

1:17:27.380 --> 1:17:29.380
Why don't you leave me?

1:17:36.046 --> 1:17:37.046
I'm the fag.

1:17:42.546 --> 1:17:43.380
What?

1:17:44.255 --> 1:17:45.296
The fag.

1:17:47.463 --> 1:17:48.296
It's me.

1:17:51.046 --> 1:17:52.838
With a capital F.

1:17:53.296 --> 1:17:54.171
Fag!

1:17:55.630 --> 1:17:57.463
I'm allowed to say it. It's me.

1:17:58.963 --> 1:18:01.755
I told you it wasn't a good idea
to swap phones.

1:18:03.171 --> 1:18:07.963
By the way, I'm sorry, Doctor,
but I never had any precursory signs.

1:18:11.963 --> 1:18:13.963
There were never any dresses
that fit me.

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:21.380
Don't say it. You don't have to.

1:18:24.546 --> 1:18:25.380
Ben.

1:18:27.838 --> 1:18:29.463
Is that why they fired you?

1:18:30.421 --> 1:18:31.505
What do you think?

1:18:33.421 --> 1:18:34.546
They can't do that.

1:18:35.296 --> 1:18:36.463
You can't let them.

1:18:42.588 --> 1:18:44.505
Look at how you reacted tonight.

1:18:45.713 --> 1:18:48.463
Now imagine my colleagues
at St. Genevieve's.

1:18:55.463 --> 1:18:56.921
Not to mention my parents.

1:18:59.338 --> 1:19:00.505
It would be nice...

1:19:02.005 --> 1:19:04.005
It would be nice to meet Julien.

1:19:06.296 --> 1:19:07.380
I don't think so.

1:19:10.213 --> 1:19:13.130
I've gotten used to your jokes
since third grade.

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.255
But I'm afraid he'll feel uneasy
at the first funny look.

1:19:17.796 --> 1:19:19.921
And I don't want him to feel uneasy.

1:19:26.880 --> 1:19:29.255
When you love someone, you protect them.

1:19:43.671 --> 1:19:44.505
Léa?

1:19:45.005 --> 1:19:45.963
Open up.

1:19:46.671 --> 1:19:47.588
Léa, answer me.

1:19:48.130 --> 1:19:50.463
My love!

1:19:51.005 --> 1:19:52.255
Léa, answer! Open the door!

1:19:52.338 --> 1:19:55.338
Help me out.
She locked herself in and won't answer.

1:19:55.671 --> 1:19:57.921
-Léa, open the door. Answer!
-What's going on?

1:19:58.005 --> 1:19:58.880
Léa?

1:19:58.963 --> 1:20:00.630
-Move aside.
-Wait...

1:20:01.505 --> 1:20:02.880
Shit, my capsulitis!

1:20:03.713 --> 1:20:04.546
Léa!

1:20:04.630 --> 1:20:07.255
-Sweetheart, answer me, please.
-Stand aside.

1:20:08.088 --> 1:20:09.005
Move.

1:20:14.963 --> 1:20:16.338
Are you okay, my love?

1:20:18.421 --> 1:20:19.963
Léa, please answer me.

1:20:25.838 --> 1:20:26.671
Here.

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:31.421
Your mom called.
I told her you're going to be a dad.

1:20:32.338 --> 1:20:33.630
She's overjoyed.

1:20:35.005 --> 1:20:36.046
Léa.

1:20:37.380 --> 1:20:39.505
You're right.
Keep your Julien to yourself.

1:21:09.880 --> 1:21:10.838
Go after her.

1:21:14.005 --> 1:21:14.838
Léa!

1:21:16.005 --> 1:21:17.088
Léa!

1:21:52.505 --> 1:21:54.296
If you swapped phones,

1:21:55.963 --> 1:21:58.380
"X" sent that picture to you.

1:22:02.171 --> 1:22:03.296
Who is she?

1:22:04.296 --> 1:22:05.255
No one.

1:22:06.171 --> 1:22:08.588
She's virtual, like your Facebook guy.

1:22:10.546 --> 1:22:12.588
What's happened to us?

1:22:23.838 --> 1:22:24.671
Léa!

1:22:26.671 --> 1:22:27.505
Léa!

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:52.713
I win.

1:22:53.671 --> 1:22:57.171
-I told you I'd beat you on the way down.
-Congratulations, my love.

1:23:02.838 --> 1:23:04.921
Don't call my mother at this hour.

1:23:05.380 --> 1:23:07.171
She didn't take them clubbing!

1:23:07.713 --> 1:23:08.921
Put that phone away.

1:23:12.755 --> 1:23:14.546
Couldn't you wait to get home?

1:23:15.338 --> 1:23:16.380
Party-pooper.

1:23:18.296 --> 1:23:20.880
That's it. The eclipse is over.

1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:27.755
It was pretty though.

1:23:27.838 --> 1:23:29.880
It was pretty, but the food was awful.

1:23:29.963 --> 1:23:31.713
Foie gras in milk. He's crazy.

1:23:31.796 --> 1:23:34.130
-The eclipse was nice, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

1:23:34.338 --> 1:23:37.296
We don't need a taxi.
Will you drop us off, Thomas?

1:23:37.713 --> 1:23:40.088
Why didn't I buy a Smart, like Ben?

1:23:40.171 --> 1:23:42.213
Smarts don't make good taxis.

1:23:43.213 --> 1:23:44.421
I'll send you the photo.

1:23:45.130 --> 1:23:46.588
Oh, yeah. Like you always do.

1:23:46.671 --> 1:23:48.296
We want to meet your new girl.

1:23:48.380 --> 1:23:50.463
Right, what's her name again?

1:23:51.755 --> 1:23:53.380
-Julie.
-Say hi for us.

1:23:54.338 --> 1:23:56.338
Let's go. The meter's on.

1:23:56.421 --> 1:23:58.255
Let me know if we play tomorrow.

1:23:58.338 --> 1:24:00.755
I didn't get a text, so I doubt it.

1:24:00.838 --> 1:24:02.338
But I'll let you know.

1:24:04.921 --> 1:24:07.255
JULIEN
SO...? ANSWER ME.

1:24:08.546 --> 1:24:10.255
She never gives up!

1:24:10.338 --> 1:24:11.713
-The dispatcher?
-Yeah!

1:24:11.796 --> 1:24:13.463
She wants me to work weekends.

1:24:13.546 --> 1:24:14.713
She's out of her mind.

1:24:14.796 --> 1:24:16.671
Oh, shit, a parking ticket.

1:24:16.755 --> 1:24:18.296
-I told you.
-It's a disabled spot.

1:24:18.380 --> 1:24:21.963
Why? There are no disabled people here.
It's a myth.

1:24:26.588 --> 1:24:30.546
ALL GOOD. IN BED. SPEAK TOMORROW.

1:24:52.255 --> 1:24:54.546
Too bad we didn't play that phone game.

1:24:54.630 --> 1:24:55.838
It could have been fun.

1:24:56.588 --> 1:24:57.421
Fun?

1:24:58.171 --> 1:24:59.130
I doubt that.

1:25:01.171 --> 1:25:03.171
I don't care what's in your phone.

1:25:09.005 --> 1:25:11.713
In love, as in friendship,
some things are best kept secret.

1:25:38.046 --> 1:25:40.255
These stickers never come off!

1:25:52.796 --> 1:25:54.463
Oh, I just want to get home.

1:25:55.421 --> 1:25:56.921
Thomas, the kids!

1:25:57.005 --> 1:25:58.796
Shit. I can't get it off.

1:25:58.880 --> 1:25:59.880
Damn it!

1:27:36.046 --> 1:27:41.213
CAROLE DISPATCHER
CALL ME. SUPER URGENT!!!

1:28:13.921 --> 1:28:15.630
Are you ready? Go!

1:28:16.130 --> 1:28:17.921
One, two. One, two...
