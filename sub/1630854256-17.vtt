00:08.008 --> 00:10.878
GEORGE W. BUSH
My fellow Americans,

00:10.978 --> 00:14.615
major combat operations
in Iraq have ended.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.551
In the battle of Iraq,
the United States

00:17.651 --> 00:20.054
and our allies have prevailed.

01:09.970 --> 01:13.441
Help! Someone help!

01:13.541 --> 01:17.077
Help! Someone! Help!

01:37.465 --> 01:39.267
Stop.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.641
Hey.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.744
Yeah, it's hers, all right.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.516
Who's your best team
in the area?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.519
Great.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.344
I don't know
what to tell you,

02:23.444 --> 02:24.812
but Rosa needs extracurriculars

02:24.912 --> 02:26.013
for her college applications.

02:26.113 --> 02:27.748
Yeah, but since when
does Yale care

02:27.848 --> 02:29.683
if their law students
can twirl a baton?
What?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.852
The courtroom is no place
for gymnastics, my dear.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.787
No, no, no. They care about
well-rounded students.

02:33.887 --> 02:35.889
But also, baton twirling?
Color Guard, not gymnastics.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.391
Yeah, but it can
be super dangerous.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.959
She could fall
off the balance beam,

02:39.059 --> 02:40.428
she could hit her head,
she could get a concussion,

02:40.528 --> 02:41.495
or she could breathe
in the chalk dust.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.863
I bet that's not good for her.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.933
Okay, Mr. Safety,
why don't you tell me

02:46.033 --> 02:47.568
what you would like
your daughter to do.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.270
Track?
Shin splints.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.440
Water polo?
Uh, chlorine poisoning, obviously.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.141
AV Club?
Electrocution.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.943
Stop.
I know, I know.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.512
I know, I'm sorry.
I'm only half-joking.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.848
Sweetie, I want Rosa
to be safe, too,

03:00.948 --> 03:03.317
but she cannot spend her life
covered in bubble wrap.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.152
You're right. You're right.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.854
I was just thinking
maybe we could just do

03:06.954 --> 03:09.557
a light to medium
layer of packing peanuts?

03:09.657 --> 03:10.758
I'm gonna go solve cases.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.993
I'm gonna go solve cases. Yeah.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.630
Hey. We got a new case?
Not exactly.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.131
So, there's not a case?

03:18.232 --> 03:19.600
We do, it's just not new.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.968
It's from 2003.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.670
Uh, okay,
we don't work cold cases.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.338
So why are we handling this one?

03:24.438 --> 03:27.841
We've been asked to assist
NCIS's Cold Case Homicide Unit.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.843
New evidence was just
uncovered in a case

03:29.943 --> 03:32.145
involving a missing
Navy petty officer

03:32.246 --> 03:33.647
named Britney Perez.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.616
Britney Perez. Why-why
does that sound familiar?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.818
Well, Britney's case was
the subject of a docuseries

03:37.918 --> 03:39.620
that came out last year.
That's right.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.088
Okay, so they found her?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.490
No. Just her car.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.758
A hiker spotted it at
Castaic Lake yesterday.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.727
Well, technically,
they found it <i>in</i> the lake.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.697
But water levels are so low that
you could see it from a trail.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.432
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

03:51.532 --> 03:53.567
but thank God for
climate change.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.735
Nope, that still feels wrong.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.970
Uh, should we alert Kilbride?

03:57.070 --> 03:59.907
No. Let's let that man
spend some time with his son.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.742
We can handle this.
Where's, uh, Sam and Callen?

04:01.842 --> 04:03.210
They're on their way
to the crime scene.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.779
And MCRT has a team
down there combing the lake.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.548
Does she have
any family close by?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.717
Yes, her mother.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.419
And it looks like she hasn't
been informed yet.

04:11.519 --> 04:14.888
I can't imagine losing a child
and not knowing what happened.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.757
Yeah, we'll go
talk to the mom.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.593
If nothing else, maybe we can
give her some answers.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.662
Okay.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.439
Hey, Dad.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.774
Alex.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.810
Uh, it's just temporary.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.814
Deb and I are still
trying to work things out.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.252
Uh...

04:45.353 --> 04:47.755
I-I made some coffee.
Where can I hang my...?

04:47.855 --> 04:50.257
Anywhere.
Anywhere's fine.

04:59.199 --> 05:01.335
So...

05:01.435 --> 05:03.236
How are things at the firm?

05:03.337 --> 05:05.238
Uh, yeah, great.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.907
I just got a new client.

05:07.007 --> 05:11.011
It's a tech company working
on a cryptocurrency exchange.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.282
I think it's gonna be
really good.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.987
Uh...

05:36.036 --> 05:37.671
All I'm saying is:
give it a shot.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.140
What do you got to lose?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.241
Famous last words.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.943
I'd say you're being
a tad dramatic.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.612
Can I tell Anna it's a yes?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.880
Absolutely not. And can we
please stop talking about Anna?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.949
We're not talking about Anna.
We're talking about Stacy.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.283
No, <i>you're</i> talking
about Stacy.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.819
I don't even know
who this person is.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.253
Okay, she's Anna's
maid of honor.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.322
Which is why this is so perfect.
You're my best man--

05:55.423 --> 05:56.957
For now.
Again with the drama.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.359
Look, can we just drop it?
Or there will be drama.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.561
All right?

06:00.661 --> 06:01.762
Okay, so you'll think about it?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.231
Special Agent Van Zant?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.833
Give us a second.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.437
Special Agent Van Zant
was my father.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.704
You can call me Daisy.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.305
Okay, Daisy. I'm Callen,
this is Sam.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.674
How can we help?

06:13.774 --> 06:16.076
Stay close by.
Try not to get in the way.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.478
First cold case?

06:17.578 --> 06:18.746
Yeah.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.247
Couple of virgins.
This'll be fun.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.982
I've been working
cases since '04.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.952
Solved more of them than
the next two agents combined.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.520
I like your modesty.

06:26.620 --> 06:27.855
Confidence in a woman

06:27.955 --> 06:29.457
make you uncomfortable,
Agent Callen?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.258
Well, if it did, then I'm about
to marry the wrong woman.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.026
Congratulations
on the wedding.

06:33.126 --> 06:33.927
Like I said,

06:34.027 --> 06:34.995
I'm the best we've got,

06:35.095 --> 06:36.396
but this one's had my number.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.397
And why is that?

06:37.498 --> 06:38.632
In a word, evidence.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.534
There wasn't any. Until now.
Mm-hmm.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.870
Daisy.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.772
Hmm.
Stay close.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.121
Welcome to Cold Case, gentleman.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.101
Hey.
Coroner just identified the body

07:14.201 --> 07:15.803
as Petty Officer Perez.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.438
Good luck.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.875
Kensi and Deeks are about
to meet with Britney's mom.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.376
They'll inform her.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.345
No easy way
to deliver that news.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.115
Well, at least it's coming
from us and not...

07:28.816 --> 07:31.451
So who were the agents on
the original investigation?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.120
Couple of guys from
the local field office,

07:33.220 --> 07:35.088
Walker and Haskins.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.990
Both retired before I got here.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.258
I think Walker moved to Florida

07:38.358 --> 07:39.627
and Haskins died
some years back.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.629
What's your take?
Put it this way:

07:41.729 --> 07:43.330
There's good work,
there's sloppy work,

07:43.430 --> 07:45.365
and then there's
whatever the hell this was.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.334
It's no wonder the case
ended up with us.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.202
Did they identify any suspects?

07:49.302 --> 07:52.573
One. Petty Officer Aaron Baker.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.575
The night before
Britney went missing,

07:54.675 --> 07:57.210
a witness saw the two of them
arguing outside a bar.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.379
And Aaron must've
said something to her

07:59.479 --> 08:01.048
because apparently
she gave him a good slap.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.349
What was the argument about?

08:02.449 --> 08:04.852
I don't know.
And neither does Aaron.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.587
Claims he was
too drunk to remember,

08:06.687 --> 08:09.056
and Walker and Haskins
didn't push him any further.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.059
Wow.
Yeah, life's good when
you're third generation Navy.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.260
What was the alibi?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.595
His bunkmate.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.664
Name escapes me,
but it's in the file.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.998
Aaron said they were
playing video games

08:18.098 --> 08:19.299
and watching
movies all night.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.801
So he wasn't too drunk
to remember that.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.370
I'm guessing the, uh,
bunkmate's story matches?

08:23.470 --> 08:24.605
To a T. Aaron was cleared,

08:24.705 --> 08:26.940
the case has
been cold ever since.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.008
Can I have a vial?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.376
What do you got?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.945
Something. Thank you.

08:37.651 --> 08:38.786
Huh.

08:40.487 --> 08:41.655
It's a tooth.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.224
It's not hers.
Looks like she has a full set.

08:44.324 --> 08:48.095
Well, maybe Britney took part
of the killer with her.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.330
She kept fighting until the end.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.766
You think you can
pull DNA from this?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.668
Teeth and bone
are the most reliable.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.069
But 20 years under water?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.238
You'd have more luck
keeping flies off manure.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.306
Well, good luck.

08:59.406 --> 09:00.708
I'll see what we can do.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.542
Yeah, well, we'll pay
this, uh, Aaron a visit.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.178
See if we can jog his memory
about any other details.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.513
Thank you, Daisy.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.118
Anything else we can
get you, Mrs. Perez?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.020
No, I'm fine, thank you.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.622
Oh, she's beautiful.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.056
She was.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.391
And smart. And funny.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.693
Mm.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.262
We're incredibly sorry
for your loss.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.131
Thank you.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.500
I'm a single parent.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.803
You know, we only had...
each other.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.371
Always.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.075
That's why, uh...

09:35.175 --> 09:36.944
I never believed them.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.512
Believed who?

09:39.613 --> 09:41.815
The investigators.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.854
They thought that Britney
had gone AWOL,

09:46.954 --> 09:49.456
that she couldn't handle
the pressure of the Navy,

09:49.556 --> 09:51.558
the thought of deployment.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.694
Did she express
or articulate

09:53.794 --> 09:55.328
any of those feelings to you?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.464
No.

09:57.564 --> 10:00.968
No, no, she loved the Navy.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.435
I would know,

10:02.535 --> 10:04.504
we spoke all the time.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.674
She would never keep
something like that from me,

10:06.774 --> 10:09.743
and leave without
saying goodbye?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.378
No.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.514
The-the last time you spoke to
her, how did she seem to you?

10:14.614 --> 10:17.417
Did she mention
anything unusual, or...?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.153
She...

10:20.253 --> 10:22.289
She was upset.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.424
And-and frazzled, and...

10:24.524 --> 10:26.860
just not her usual happy self.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.497
Something to do, um...

10:30.597 --> 10:32.599
with her roommate, Jen.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.268
It-it was a bad situation,

10:35.368 --> 10:37.838
but she just...

10:37.938 --> 10:39.572
She wouldn't tell me
the whole story.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.942
Why? Why wouldn't
she tell you that?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.144
I-I...

10:44.244 --> 10:47.514
I think she was trying
to protect me.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.717
That was Britney.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.053
Always, always
looking out for others.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.289
She sounds like she was
a really wonderful person.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.125
Yeah.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.127
I've been waiting
for this day for...

11:00.227 --> 11:01.528
for 20 years.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.596
Hoping...

11:04.664 --> 11:07.735
...that someone would find her.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.670
And now that it's here,
I-I would give anything,

11:10.771 --> 11:12.605
absolutely anything,

11:12.706 --> 11:14.207
to go back.

11:14.307 --> 11:18.078
You know? To just have
one more day of not knowing.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.249
One more day of not
thinking how someone...

11:29.322 --> 11:33.060
Promise me that you won't
give up on her this time.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.133
I promise.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.170
Where were you?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.704
Digging into
Aaron Baker.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.240
Check it out.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.876
Okay, so when he was 18,

11:48.976 --> 11:50.944
he was arrested for
assault and battery.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.113
Which he pled down
to a misdemeanor,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.715
struck a deal with the DA
and got off easy.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.517
Okay, so, this is
a good thing, right?

11:57.617 --> 11:58.819
It means he had
a history of violence.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.653
Yeah, that and this means

12:00.754 --> 12:03.090
that his DNA is gonna
be on file in CODIS.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.958
So if the tooth
that Callen and Sam found

12:05.058 --> 12:06.794
in the trunk of
Britney's car was Aaron's,

12:06.894 --> 12:09.462
then it'll show up when they
run it through the database.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.964
Bingo.
Bam.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.599
What's up with the case files
we're waiting for?

12:12.699 --> 12:14.201
I don't know,
they've been "on the way"

12:14.301 --> 12:15.702
for like two hours.

12:15.803 --> 12:18.171
How long does it take
to upload a digital file?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.775
Who's this?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.378
This is the roommate that
Britney's mom was talking about.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.947
Petty Officer Jen Anderson.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.083
In her Navy profile,
it says that she went "UA"

12:30.183 --> 12:32.019
just days before
Britney went missing.

12:32.119 --> 12:34.254
So she dropped out.
Does it say why?

12:34.354 --> 12:36.924
I'm sure it does in the files.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.928
Which we just received.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.530
What? I didn't see
anything come in.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.266
Daisy says
they're downstairs.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.570
These can't be
the case files.

12:52.339 --> 12:55.008
"Sorry, kids, this is how
we did things in the old days.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.243
Good luck. Daisy."

12:56.343 --> 12:59.046
How can they be both
charred and moist?

13:00.513 --> 13:01.982
"P.S. Don't mind the soot.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.550
Wildfire got them in '09,

13:03.650 --> 13:06.153
flood in '15,
you get the idea."

13:07.888 --> 13:11.058
Ah, well, so...
uh, you got this, right?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.792
Uh...

13:15.963 --> 13:16.930
Ugh.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.699
Aaron Baker?

13:20.767 --> 13:22.435
Oh, you flatter me.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.972
I'm Aaron's father, Jack.
Can I help you gentleman?

13:25.072 --> 13:28.175
NCIS. We were hoping
to speak with your son.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.843
I understand he's
working from home today.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.544
This is his house, right?

13:31.644 --> 13:34.247
Yeah. He and Melissa have been
kind enough to let me move in

13:34.347 --> 13:37.050
since my house burned down
in the Bell Canyon fires.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.587
We're sorry to hear about that.
Is Aaron inside?

13:40.687 --> 13:42.122
You just missed him.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.391
But I'll tell him you
stopped by. What's it about?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.259
We're following up
on a cold case from 2003.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.695
It's kind of important
we speak with him.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.263
Can you tell us where he is?

13:50.363 --> 13:51.531
Do you have any idea

13:51.631 --> 13:53.066
the problems this
investigation has caused

13:53.166 --> 13:55.002
with that
damn docuseries?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.803
Late night phone calls,

13:56.904 --> 13:59.272
people just coming
up to the house.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.807
Death threats.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.242
I'm sorry your family
had to go through that.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.278
Yeah. I'll pass along
the message.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.684
First rule of seamanship:

14:11.784 --> 14:14.221
Always keep the lines taut.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.455
Were you Navy?

14:15.555 --> 14:17.824
Senior Chief, Special Warfare.

14:18.725 --> 14:22.329
Look, we only want
to speak with him.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.767
Well, Aaron and Melissa went
to go get some more shellac.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.003
They'll come back soon.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.838
You want to come inside
and wait?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.912
I piloted that in Desert Storm.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.248
I was a Chief Petty
Officer back then,

14:41.348 --> 14:42.482
ran a Beachmasters unit.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.217
Toughest son of a bitches
you ever met.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.020
You look like you may have
seen some combat time.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.790
Enough to know I never
want to see it again. Hmm.

14:52.059 --> 14:52.759
Hey.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.494
What's going on?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.463
Aaron, we're NCIS.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.931
We just wanted to ask
you a few questions

14:58.031 --> 15:00.167
about Petty Officer
Britney Perez.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.902
No. You can't keep putting
us through this.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.772
Her body was found this morning.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.109
The sooner we have answers,

15:09.209 --> 15:11.478
the sooner this is
over for everyone.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.847
They're just doing their job.

15:17.484 --> 15:18.618
Yeah.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.420
It's fine.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.193
What do you want to know?

15:26.293 --> 15:28.195
Why don't you start
by telling us

15:28.295 --> 15:31.331
what you Britney were arguing
about before she disappeared?

15:31.431 --> 15:34.301
I wish I could.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.768
But I don't remember.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.205
And that's because you were
too drunk at the time?

15:38.305 --> 15:41.008
Look, guys, remember
it was 20 years ago.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.376
All right, what about
your bunkmate?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.112
Do you remember his name?

15:46.079 --> 15:47.914
Yeah. Kevin. Kevin Philips.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.449
You two were pretty close
at the time?

15:49.549 --> 15:51.084
Sure, you could say that.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.053
When's the last time
you talked to him?

15:55.122 --> 15:57.857
A decade, maybe longer.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.559
We slowly lost touch.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.462
Look, I know you guys are
looking for clear answers,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.564
but...

16:04.664 --> 16:05.932
...it's been 20 years.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.968
I get it.
Uh, just one more thing.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.204
Would you be willing to turn
over your dental records?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.473
I'm sorry, no,

16:13.573 --> 16:15.075
but this is harassment.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.544
My husband's been
cleared and you're...

16:17.644 --> 16:18.711
asking about his teeth?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.681
It's related to the case.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.350
New evidence was discovered.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.686
Then if you want his
records, you need a warrant.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.421
I'm calling our lawyer.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.956
We're done talking.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.961
I think Aaron remembers
more than he's telling us.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.663
And Melissa knows it.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.565
I don't think we're getting
anything else out of those two.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.333
I have Rountree
tracking down Kevin Philips.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.602
Maybe we'll find out
if this alibi is true.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.071
Hmm.
What?

16:44.171 --> 16:46.706
Looks like Daisy
was able to extract

16:46.806 --> 16:48.808
usable DNA from the tooth.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.310
She's sending it to CODIS now.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.312
Then we don't need
Aaron's dental records.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.446
We have his DNA.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.515
And if he did
kill Britney...

16:55.615 --> 16:57.484
we'll know soon.

17:08.195 --> 17:11.431
Oh, damn. Looks like an episode
of <i>Hoarders</i> down here.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.932
How's it going?

17:13.833 --> 17:16.836
Well, half of these files
don't even belong to our case

17:16.936 --> 17:19.939
and the other half are
moldy, burnt, or chewed.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.410
And I'm pretty sure something
is living in that one.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.646
What about you?
Any good news?

17:26.746 --> 17:29.982
Yeah, I found Jen Anderson,
Britney's roommate.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.319
She was arrested five years ago
for drug possession.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.054
She's currently out on parole
right now living in Sun Valley.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.790
Kensi and Deeks are
on their way there now.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.460
Hey, take a look at these.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.562
Aaron Baker, Carmen Perez...

17:42.662 --> 17:44.331
These must be the
recorded interviews

17:44.431 --> 17:45.665
from the initial investigation.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.401
Cassette tapes in '03?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.437
Yeah, I'm starting
to get the sense

17:50.537 --> 17:52.805
that tech wasn't exactly
this department's thing.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.375
Yeah. But where the hell are
we supposed to find something

17:55.475 --> 17:57.844
old enough to play these?

17:57.944 --> 17:59.712
Kilbride's truck
is in the carport.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.681
You don't think
he'd mind if we...

18:01.781 --> 18:04.251
borrowed it for a few hours?
No.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.052
It's for the investigation.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.954
Plus, he's on vacation.

18:08.054 --> 18:10.257
He's probably having the time
of his life right now.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.527
Great coffee, huh?

18:14.627 --> 18:17.864
This is some grade-A primo java
straight from Guatemala.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.467
I get it from a guy who sells
it at the farmers' market down--

18:20.567 --> 18:23.002
Ah, I'm good, thanks.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.606
More for me.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.547
Alex, you know why I'm here.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.585
I've got a handle on it.

18:38.685 --> 18:39.886
I'm back in rehab.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.788
And this time
I'm sticking with it.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.291
So I've been told.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.925
Happy to hear it.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.065
This is so weird.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.035
Would you prefer that we...

18:56.135 --> 18:58.571
simply pick up
where we left off?

18:58.671 --> 19:01.241
I don't know. At least
you were being yourself.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.945
This isn't easy for me, either.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.248
Then what are you
even doing here?

19:10.350 --> 19:12.952
Mom asked you
to come, right?

19:13.052 --> 19:14.687
She could...

19:14.787 --> 19:16.989
Of course she did. I knew it.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.159
Mom could never leave
well enough alone.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.061
If it were "well enough,"
she wouldn't have asked.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.896
Yeah, well,
nothing ever is, is it?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.266
Oh, hell.
Don't give me that crap.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.734
This is not about me.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.637
We gave you every advantage
a kid could want.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.071
You could've done anything.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.940
Been anything.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.743
You chose... this.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.579
I didn't choose this, Dad.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.214
You didn't say no to it,
did you?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.815
You know, maybe the
difference between us is

19:42.915 --> 19:45.151
I wasn't born ready
to take on the world,

19:45.252 --> 19:46.553
like you.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.054
No, no, the only difference
between us is

19:48.154 --> 19:50.223
I didn't fold up
like a cheap suit

19:50.323 --> 19:52.124
every time life got hard!

19:54.994 --> 19:57.530
"Suck it up." "Tough it out."

19:57.630 --> 19:59.766
"Walk it off."
"Bite the bullet."

19:59.866 --> 20:02.134
And "take it like a man."
That about cover it?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.904
Did I miss one, Dad?

20:12.178 --> 20:14.414
I am here to help, Alex.

20:14.514 --> 20:17.584
Awfully late for that.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.720
Awfully late. By about 40 years.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.291
I don't want your help.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.394
So just go.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.795
Just go.

20:28.895 --> 20:29.962
I'm sure you've got
lots of important work

20:30.062 --> 20:32.231
you need to
get back to.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.870
Go.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.772
I got it. Emily.

21:12.872 --> 21:13.873
And who is Emily?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.007
Your plus-one for the wedding.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.843
You two would be
perfect together.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.745
Isn't that the same thing
you said about Stacy?

21:18.845 --> 21:20.647
No, no, no, I've
moved on from Stacy.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.982
You and Emily are
a much better fit.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.184
You know, G,
if you don't drop this idea,

21:25.284 --> 21:26.986
you're going to be the next
thing they find in a lake.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.588
You need time to think about it

21:28.688 --> 21:29.722
and I can respect that.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.492
Sorry, boys. No dice.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.361
Results came back inconclusive.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.729
So what are you saying?
It's not Aaron's tooth?

21:36.829 --> 21:39.231
Not according to CODIS.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.734
Some days you're the pigeon,
some days you're the statue.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.235
We're still only dealing
with a database

21:43.336 --> 21:45.405
full of violent offenders,
missing persons,

21:45.505 --> 21:47.374
and forensic samples
collected from crime scenes.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.809
Oh, great, so our pool
of potential suspects

21:49.909 --> 21:51.411
is basically anyone else

21:51.511 --> 21:53.746
that was living
in Los Angeles in 2003?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.548
Anyone else except Aaron Baker.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.350
What about forensic genealogy?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.051
Isn't that how they found
the Golden State Killer?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.287
It's not as easy
as the media makes it seem.

22:01.388 --> 22:03.055
First, we'd have to build out
a family tree.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.391
That takes time.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.192
And then, well,
we have to pray the killer

22:06.292 --> 22:08.761
had some relative who wanted
to see how Scottish they were.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.698
I'll get my team
started on it.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.135
I like her.

22:16.235 --> 22:20.573
In a plus-one kind of way?
Stop.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.674
Hey, guys.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.610
Yeah, Rountree,
what do you got?

22:23.710 --> 22:26.245
I located Kevin Philips.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.314
He's working for
a masonry contractor

22:28.415 --> 22:29.816
down in Manhattan Beach.

22:29.916 --> 22:32.084
Well, at least he has
for the past two years.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.285
And before that?

22:33.386 --> 22:35.121
Twin Towers
Correctional Facility.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.057
Busted on wire fraud
and falsifying records.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.726
Aaron's alibi
is a convicted liar,

22:39.826 --> 22:41.260
so the alibi itself
could be a lie.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.230
Well, what if the alibi
wasn't just for Aaron?

22:44.330 --> 22:46.098
What if Kevin was covering
for himself too?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.234
They worked together
to kill Britney?

22:48.334 --> 22:51.303
Nonviolent criminals wouldn't
have their DNA in CODIS.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.040
That tooth we found
could be Kevin's.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.843
Rountree?
Yeah?

22:56.943 --> 22:58.745
Have Castor pick up Kevin
and bring him to the boatshed.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.980
All right, I'm on it.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.717
This is just a classic
case of he said/she said.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.319
Admiral, you're back so soon.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.923
Very funny.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.459
Thought you might
like that one.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.527
Where'd you find
the keys to this bad boy?

23:14.627 --> 23:16.896
Who said I used keys?
Oh.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.398
Don't worry, it was unlocked.

23:20.366 --> 23:23.102
Ah. Find anything?

23:23.202 --> 23:26.405
Well, apparently Britney met
with her commanding officer

23:26.506 --> 23:27.440
before she went missing.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.441
About what?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.943
To report Aaron Baker.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.012
This is her CO talking about it.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.981
He wasn't even involved
in the alleged assault.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.549
And no one else stepped forward.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.453
If we investigated every
unsubstantiated emotional claim

23:40.553 --> 23:42.221
some girl makes against our POs,

23:42.321 --> 23:44.323
well, NCIS would stop
taking our calls.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.994
Wow.
Yeah.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.129
I mean, no wonder Britney
confronted Aaron.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.998
Her CO brushed her off.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.033
Forced her to take matters
into her own hands.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.369
But then what's the motive
to kill Britney?

23:57.470 --> 24:00.106
I mean, there's no need
to keep her from reporting it.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.674
She did and nothing happened.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.409
Maybe she didn't stop there.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.411
Threatened to take
the claim further.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.979
How far you thinking?

24:07.947 --> 24:10.316
Far enough to cost
Britney her life.

24:10.416 --> 24:14.286
So, no Girl Scouts,
no academic decathlon,

24:14.386 --> 24:16.789
uh, no choir, and,
um... the other one?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.290
Ceramics.
Ceramics, yes.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.926
What the heck is wrong
with ceramics?

24:20.026 --> 24:22.895
What kind of maniac
lets minors use a kiln?

24:22.995 --> 24:25.932
You are unbelievable,
you know that?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.801
Jen Anderson.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.202
NCIS.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.639
Just need to speak with you
for a second.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.406
Deeks.

24:35.642 --> 24:36.809
Jen?

24:36.909 --> 24:37.844
Deeks!

24:40.847 --> 24:41.748
Fatima, we got shots fired.

24:41.848 --> 24:42.915
I'll take the back!

24:43.015 --> 24:43.750
I'll cover the front.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.251
Son of a bitch.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.073
Kens!

25:11.644 --> 25:12.879
Stay down!

25:13.580 --> 25:14.681
No.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.583
Kensi.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.052
Come out with your hands up.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.621
Now!

25:25.858 --> 25:27.159
Jen Anderson?

25:28.060 --> 25:29.929
I know why you're here.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.210
Tried to tell him you
weren't here to arrest him,

25:44.310 --> 25:47.379
but Marcus
is a narcissistic idiot.

25:47.479 --> 25:48.981
What's going to happen to him?
Well...

25:49.081 --> 25:50.650
LAPD found a bunch
of drugs on him

25:50.750 --> 25:51.951
and shooting at federal agents

25:52.051 --> 25:54.286
isn't exactly
a misdemeanor, so, uh...

25:54.386 --> 25:56.288
So he's going to prison.
Yeah, most likely

25:56.388 --> 25:57.657
for a long time.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.760
Jen, we need to know
about Aaron Baker.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.495
His relationship with
you and with Britney.

26:03.596 --> 26:05.965
We know they got in a fight
the day before she disappeared.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.867
Aaron couldn't remember
all the details,

26:07.967 --> 26:10.269
but he did say the fight
was about you, so...

26:10.369 --> 26:12.271
Wait, uh...

26:12.371 --> 26:14.040
You spoke to him about it?

26:15.274 --> 26:16.676
Yeah, we did.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.516
I'm gonna go finish up with... Yeah.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.753
Thank you.
Uh-huh.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.430
Did something happen...

26:38.530 --> 26:40.667
between you and Aaron?

26:47.506 --> 26:50.777
Look, Jen, I know this
is really difficult.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.847
But we can't solve
Britney's case without you.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.617
So if there's anything that
you can tell me right now...

27:00.386 --> 27:02.955
One night on base...

27:03.055 --> 27:05.391
Aaron...

27:05.491 --> 27:07.927
assaulted me.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.098
Took my life from me.

27:12.198 --> 27:16.568
Not with his, like
nothing ever happened.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.572
Is that why
you left the Navy?

27:21.841 --> 27:22.942
Mm.

27:24.543 --> 27:25.778
Britney knew about this?

27:25.878 --> 27:29.581
She was the only person I told.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.320
Britney was a good friend,

27:34.420 --> 27:36.989
she wouldn't stand for it.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.491
She couldn't let me
give up on my career

27:39.591 --> 27:42.594
while that dirtbag
walked around free.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.497
She reported it the day
she went missing.

27:45.597 --> 27:48.667
I begged her not to,

27:48.768 --> 27:50.937
but she didn't listen.

27:52.972 --> 27:55.908
I was so scared
I left that day.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.712
Never spoke
to her again.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.884
A few days later, I saw
she went missing on the news.

28:07.619 --> 28:10.089
Is that why you never
spoke to investigators?

28:12.424 --> 28:14.593
Why would they believe me?

28:14.693 --> 28:16.729
They didn't believe her.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.632
Well, your criminal record

28:20.733 --> 28:22.735
doesn't make you the world's
most credible witness.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.070
Aaron was my best friend,

28:24.170 --> 28:25.905
but that doesn't mean
I'd lie to protect him.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.374
Maybe you're lying
to protect yourself.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.608
Did you help him
kill Britney?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.011
No. I had no reason to kill her.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.980
But Aaron did.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.248
She accused him
of sexual assault.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.819
You couldn't let your best
friend's career get ruined.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.620
Coming from a Navy family,

28:41.720 --> 28:43.689
you knew what that
would do to him.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.658
Look...

28:47.994 --> 28:49.261
I don't know
what else to tell you.

28:49.361 --> 28:52.098
Aaron didn't kill Britney
and neither did I.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.565
You willing to prove it?

28:53.665 --> 28:55.501
Prove it?
Yeah.
Give us a DNA sample.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.203
We'll test it against
the evidence.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.105
If you're telling the truth,
you have nothing to worry about.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.574
I have nothing to worry about.
I didn't kill her.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.644
Fine.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.013
But can you make it quick?

29:07.113 --> 29:09.081
I have to get back to work.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.120
Fatima?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.255
Can you get me Daisy?
Yeah, you got it.

29:17.356 --> 29:18.690
What was that response for

29:18.791 --> 29:21.060
when I asked you about, uh,
Aaron's family?

29:22.361 --> 29:24.964
How serious was he
about the Navy?

29:25.064 --> 29:29.435
I mean, he loved that
it helped him to get girls.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.870
If that tells
you anything.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.039
Oh, yeah, that tells me a lot.

29:33.139 --> 29:36.075
Maybe it wasn't his
decision to enlist, huh?

29:37.944 --> 29:39.578
Did he ever talk
about his father?

29:39.678 --> 29:40.980
Yeah.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.249
Pretty much any time
he got blackout drunk.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.484
Which was pretty much
all the time.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.586
I think his dad

29:47.686 --> 29:49.355
was the reason he drank so much.

29:49.455 --> 29:53.325
Like family pressures
and impossible expectations?

29:53.425 --> 29:54.593
Yeah.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.996
And how anytime
he would screw up,

29:57.096 --> 29:58.898
his dad would yell at him,

29:58.998 --> 30:01.500
say how Aaron was
embarrassing to him.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.370
I think he had it
a lot harder than most.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.938
You think Aaron
would tell his father

30:06.038 --> 30:07.806
about the argument with Britney?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.976
Well, yeah.

30:10.076 --> 30:12.078
She threatened to go
to the media.

30:14.847 --> 30:16.983
Britney was gonna blow it up.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.851
Agent Callen.
So, Aaron's bunkmate

30:18.951 --> 30:20.119
is gonna give us
a DNA sample.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.753
Do you have someone
from your team

30:21.854 --> 30:22.721
that can come
down and get it?
Forget it.

30:22.821 --> 30:23.856
It's not him.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.291
We ran the DNA from the tooth

30:25.391 --> 30:27.793
against the results
of a genealogy search,

30:27.894 --> 30:30.529
and got a match to Aaron Baker.

30:30.629 --> 30:33.599
Hold on, I thought we already
ruled him out through CODIS.

30:33.699 --> 30:34.833
Would you let me finish?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.735
It's a partial match.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.005
Is it 50%?

30:41.573 --> 30:43.042
It's his father Jack.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.978
I'll need a DNA sample
to confirm.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.681
We have just the guy for that.

30:50.716 --> 30:53.352
Oh, my God, I think there's
something alive in there.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.888
Well, good thing today
is trash day.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.024
Yeah, it'd be a shame
if we had to collect the DNA

30:58.124 --> 31:00.392
from something that was
not disgusting, covered in...

31:00.492 --> 31:01.827
God-knows-what.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.330
Hey, guys, are we sure
this is totally legal?

31:04.430 --> 31:05.965
Yeah. With the
Abandoned DNA Act,

31:06.065 --> 31:07.934
once genetic material's
on public property,

31:08.034 --> 31:10.169
we can do whatever
we want with it.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.570
Mm. Lucky us.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.473
More specifically,
lucky, lucky me.

31:14.573 --> 31:15.641
Okay, so anything

31:15.741 --> 31:17.910
on the curb lane
is public property.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.279
So, we can just grab
a tissue out of his trash can

31:20.379 --> 31:21.247
and call it a day?

31:21.347 --> 31:22.714
Well, no, it's not that simple.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.550
I mean, we need a clean sample.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.919
And a photograph to prove
that the DNA is coming from,

31:27.019 --> 31:29.255
or most likely,
out of the suspect.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.723
Oh, I love my job.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.725
I love my job.
I have a law degree.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.294
I love my job.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.429
Heads up.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.070
Looks like he's been working
on some kind of paint job.

31:45.537 --> 31:48.274
<i>Oh, and he's putting it
in the recycling bin.</i>

31:48.374 --> 31:50.042
Wow, this guy
really is a monster.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.843
Okay, do you
see anything on him?

31:51.944 --> 31:55.147
Uh, tissues, paper towels,
anything like that?

31:55.247 --> 31:56.915
I've got disposable gloves.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.384
Yeah, that'll do it.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.052
Uh, those gloves will have
enough skin cells inside

32:00.152 --> 32:01.653
that we can test
with the other sample.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.955
All right, sweetheart,
you're up.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.524
All right.

32:12.831 --> 32:14.400
Let's get it on.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.335
Hey, what are you doing?

32:16.435 --> 32:18.204
What?

32:18.304 --> 32:19.838
Ahh! My trash!

32:19.938 --> 32:21.407
Get out of here!
I'll call the cops!

32:21.507 --> 32:22.408
You hear me?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.743
I am Spartacus!

32:24.843 --> 32:26.378
Did he get them?

32:32.684 --> 32:34.420
Yeah...

32:34.520 --> 32:35.621
he got 'em all right.

32:35.721 --> 32:36.622
Ha!

32:36.722 --> 32:37.689
Okay.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.292
<i>Rough trip, huh?</i>

32:41.327 --> 32:42.861
Well, nothing that a hot shower

32:42.961 --> 32:45.131
and a good night's sleep
won't fix.

32:45.231 --> 32:48.534
Wake up tomorrow,
have forgotten all about it.

32:57.476 --> 32:58.477
Dad.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.479
What are you doing here?

33:00.579 --> 33:03.115
What I should've done years ago.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.789
It's a match.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.258
Really? We got him?

33:12.358 --> 33:13.825
We got him.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.594
I'm so glad I didn't touch
all that garbage for nothing.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.263
Wow.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.432
Hey, guys? We have a confirmed
match to Jack Baker.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.168
We are heading back
to Aaron's house.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.336
Slight problem.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.772
No, no.
No, no, no problem.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.040
We lost Jack.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.608
Look, our LAPD
stakeout team tailed him

33:29.708 --> 33:32.111
to a hardware store,
but he gave them the slip.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.146
We're tracking him now
using the GPS from his truck.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.714
Okay, so where is he now?

33:35.814 --> 33:38.284
Looks like he just left
a storage facility in Van Nuys.

33:38.384 --> 33:39.618
What was he doing there?

33:39.718 --> 33:40.952
Something not good.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.054
Security cameras caught him

33:42.154 --> 33:44.123
loading a rifle into his truck.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.925
He knows
we're coming for him.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.328
And that's definitely not good.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.971
We're coming up
on the 5 freeway.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.340
Which way is Jack headed?

34:01.440 --> 34:03.342
North. He just passed
through Santa Clarita.

34:03.442 --> 34:04.576
That's where we were
this morning.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.312
He could be headed
to Castaic Lake.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.546
Why would he go
there if he knows

34:07.646 --> 34:08.614
that's where we
found the body?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.182
Kens, what's your 20?

34:10.282 --> 34:11.450
We're 15 minutes behind you.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.918
Guys,
we just got a report

34:13.018 --> 34:15.787
of a hit and run two blocks
from Aaron Baker's house.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.456
The car description
matches Aaron's BMW.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.824
We're tracking it now.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.259
He may be on the way
to meet up with his dad.

34:20.359 --> 34:21.960
Or he could be
making a run for it.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.263
You two intercept Aaron.
We'll stay with Jack.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.764
Copy that.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.073
He took his rifle.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.742
Let's move.

34:40.479 --> 34:41.380
That's him.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.286
Aaron Baker, out of the car!
Hands on your head!

34:47.386 --> 34:49.288
Nice and easy!

34:49.388 --> 34:51.757
I don't have time for this.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.359
I have to talk to my dad.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.393
What for?

34:54.493 --> 34:57.196
I think he's gonna hurt himself.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.264
Or worse.

34:58.364 --> 35:01.433
Tell us exactly what he said.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.578
Callan, Sam,
we have Aaron.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.980
Jack may be on
a suicide mission.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.485
Then he's aiming
at the wrong person.

35:19.585 --> 35:22.688
He wants us to do it for him.

35:28.394 --> 35:30.929
I got eyes on Jack.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.500
It's over, Jack.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.938
That bitch was gonna
ruin Aaron's life.

35:40.038 --> 35:40.806
No.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.073
Aaron ruined his life

35:42.174 --> 35:43.709
when he assaulted
a female petty officer.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.277
I did what any father would do,

35:45.377 --> 35:46.645
I protected my son!

35:46.745 --> 35:48.046
You murdered someone

35:48.146 --> 35:50.081
who was just trying to do
the right thing.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.524
I'm not dying in prison.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.826
Put down the gun, Jack.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.197
It doesn't have to end
like this, Jack.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.368
I'm sorry.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.702
Jack!

36:28.287 --> 36:30.021
He put the safety on.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.371
Great. I miss all the fun.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.941
What? I like to see
how the story ends.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.243
So does this mean
you can now

36:51.343 --> 36:53.245
take back all those
old case files?

36:53.345 --> 36:54.646
Oh, you heard about the boxes?

36:54.746 --> 36:57.316
Yeah.
Oh, we heard
about the boxes.

36:57.416 --> 36:58.750
So now what?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.486
Back to the lab. On to the next.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.554
Rinse and repeat
until the queue is empty.

37:02.654 --> 37:03.555
How many are there?

37:03.655 --> 37:05.757
I stopped keeping count.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.926
You know,
if you ever want a change,

37:08.026 --> 37:10.696
we could always use more bodies
in the Cold Case Unit.

37:10.796 --> 37:12.631
No pun intended.
Mm-hmm.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.165
Maybe someday, huh?

37:14.266 --> 37:15.701
I got nothing but time.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.137
Ooh.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.140
Stacy met a guy. Hmm.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.376
But Emily is looking
for a plus-one.

37:25.544 --> 37:27.579
I'm sure she won't have
any trouble finding someone.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.282
Trust me,
you're blowing this.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.984
Emily? Emily is beautiful,
she's intelligent,

37:33.084 --> 37:35.754
she's outdoorsy, she makes
incredible guacamole--

37:35.854 --> 37:37.823
Okay. Okay.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.758
You're serious?
Sure.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.159
She sounds lovely.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.061
But I don't take being
a plus-one lightly.

37:43.161 --> 37:44.830
So I'm going to have to get to
know Emily before the wedding.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.366
Done. We, uh, we can have
dinner Friday night.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.634
Your treat?

37:48.734 --> 37:50.201
Thank you. Okay.

37:50.302 --> 37:51.403
And next week,

37:51.503 --> 37:52.571
we can go to that sushi place

37:52.671 --> 37:53.872
with the Michelin star chef.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.542
Well, t-that's probably
overkill, but...

37:56.642 --> 37:58.710
Don't you want me to get along
with Emily at the wedding?

37:58.810 --> 38:00.412
I want you to get along,
but I--

38:00.512 --> 38:02.280
And I know about this private
chef, they come to your house.

38:03.682 --> 38:04.783
Where you going?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.017
I'm walking home.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.653
Come on, G.
I'm your best man.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.855
Uh, for now.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.592
Won't hear about that no more.

She's gonna come forward
with her story.

It's for the best.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.376
Anything I can do?

40:13.512 --> 40:15.046
Talking helps.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.449
Yeah.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.453
Also, uh...

40:23.922 --> 40:26.191
I don't have a new client.

40:27.392 --> 40:28.860
The firm let me go.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.029
I know.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.937
Well...

40:39.037 --> 40:41.873
This, this was, um...

40:43.609 --> 40:44.710
...nice.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.478
Yeah.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.480
I, um...

40:49.915 --> 40:51.817
It's okay, Dad.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.384
Rome wasn't
built in a day.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.086
Yeah.

40:56.054 --> 40:57.422
Guess like everything else,

40:57.523 --> 40:59.424
it was built
one brick at a time.

40:59.525 --> 41:01.192
Yeah.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.129
Uh, well, you better get going

41:04.229 --> 41:06.064
or you're gonna
miss your flight.

41:06.164 --> 41:09.300
You got all that important work
to get back to, yeah?

41:10.869 --> 41:12.704
No, no, Dad, really,
your flight--

41:12.804 --> 41:14.940
Left about an hour ago.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.178
How comfortable is that sofa?

41:22.380 --> 41:23.815
For sleeping?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.652
Very.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.419
I...

41:28.520 --> 41:30.121
I'll get you a pillow.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.123
Well, while you're at it,
you could get me

41:32.223 --> 41:34.392
another cup of that, um,

41:34.492 --> 41:37.195
grade-A primo java.
