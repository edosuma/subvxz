[Hiromi] You're gonna
sell your whole life away

lied and cheated on you.

want to become a Mormon.

00:41.775 --> 00:45.044
I haven't been totally
candid with her.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.679
I've fallen short of
the standards of the church,

00:47.681 --> 00:51.216

everything I've ever told her.

This is the worst thing

03:05.853 --> 03:06.652
I should've expected this.

got taken from him
by his ex-father-in-law.

04:09.850 --> 04:13.185
So, he's not gonna be able
to go with me anywhere.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.923
How are we supposed
to be together?

04:17.925 --> 04:18.790
I can't stay with you
in your country...

04:18.792 --> 04:20.759
But I can't stay in India.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.629
What do you mean, "Then what?"
How are we supposed to be

keep coming back here?

05:55.723 --> 05:56.888
How many times?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.790
I'm supposed to be,
like, your wife

05:58.792 --> 06:00.826

here permanently.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.595
I'm not supposed
to have to keep leaving.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.731
You knew how to keep me
here in this country

06:05.733 --> 06:08.300

that's what we were gonna do.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.704
Yeah. Marry me,
remember that?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.306
Remember that little thing?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.310
Do you ever intend
to marry me, ever?

06:23.783 --> 06:27.052
I'm just so mad and so
upset and so frustrated

06:27.054 --> 06:29.888

should've took care of business.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.656

06:31.658 --> 06:33.091

06:33.093 --> 06:34.559
If you don't have
intention to marry me

06:34.561 --> 06:37.095
then you should've
figured out something else

06:37.097 --> 06:38.630
instead of letting it
get to this point

06:38.632 --> 06:42.200
where now you're asking me once
again to give up everything again.

06:44.804 --> 06:47.773
I'm not making you
do anything, Sumit.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.809

No, I look cute.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.941
It's okay, I don't have boobs.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.843
Leandro and I met when
I was living in Argentina

07:57.845 --> 07:59.845
<i>when I was 19 years old</i>

07:59.847 --> 08:02.914

the US on a spousal visa.</i>

08:02.916 --> 08:04.950
We were married
for, like, ten years.

08:05.918 --> 08:09.154
Yes, I'm nervous.
I'm very nervous, actually.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.556

08:11.558 --> 08:13.391
<i>that I wanted
to travel the world.</i>

08:13.393 --> 08:16.428
I was immature and I was,
you know, trying to find myself.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.630
But I always planned
to have Leandro in my life,

08:18.632 --> 08:20.665
and up until I met Biniyam,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.567
I thought eventually
we would get back together.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.369
This is an exciting day for me.

broke off</i>

together for Leandro's arrival.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.054

08:43.056 --> 08:44.823

- How about you?

you're so jealous.

That's not true. I'm always...

10:06.706 --> 10:09.307
Sometimes I don't wear it
when I go to the nail salon.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.082
No, it's an honest mistake.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.385
It's a normal thing, like,
sometimes I forget...

10:26.425 --> 10:27.859
No, baby. It's not like that.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.062
This is the first day that I'm,
like, you know, not using it.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.535
Am I ashamed of you?

10:37.537 --> 10:39.437
I'm not ashamed of you, baby.

10:40.873 --> 10:45.610
On one hand, I think maybe Bini he's
overreacting 'cause it's not a personal thing,

10:45.612 --> 10:48.780
but on the other hand,
I see where he's coming from.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.249

happens to be coming</i>

10:51.251 --> 10:52.884

to pick up my last paycheck.

<i>I recently quit my job
doing door-to-door sales</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:41.920

You can take a seat right here.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.430
<i>[Steven] The reason I don't
like killing bugs,</i>

13:52.432 --> 13:55.166
as a kid I was playing
in the street one day

13:55.168 --> 13:56.534
and my friend, he had a bicycle,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.103
and he ran over this ant hive,

13:59.105 --> 14:00.839
<i>and I went up and I look
closer at the ants.</i>

14:00.841 --> 14:04.709
The ants were carrying away the
dead bodies back into their tunnel.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.778
<i>I just, like, felt
such compassion for them.</i>

14:06.780 --> 14:09.113
Since then I don't
like killing bugs.

14:10.549 --> 14:13.117
I have your last check here.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.387
- Thanks, man.
- We're all pretty bummed

14:16.389 --> 14:17.655
that you're taking off on us.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.757
This is something
I really need to do.

14:19.759 --> 14:22.126
And Alina, she's
the kind of caliber girl

14:22.128 --> 14:24.662
that I feel like
I could be, you know,

14:24.664 --> 14:26.631
the rest of my life with.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.034
My only thing is I don't
wanna see you throw away

14:30.336 --> 14:34.038
an awesome job for just
a chance with this girl.

14:36.442 --> 14:40.778
It's a really big risk that he's taking
by going to Turkey and to follow Alina.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.982
My biggest concern is probably
just that their relationship

14:43.984 --> 14:46.985
isn't gonna work out
and he gets possibly hurt

14:46.987 --> 14:50.154
because of everything that
he is abandoning here.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.324
I hope everything works out.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.693
Do you want a hug right now?

- No, I'm okay.

[chuckling]

15:01.734 --> 15:04.102
In order to be with Alina,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.737
I have to give up
a lot of things

15:05.739 --> 15:07.739
<i>but it's an investment</i>

15:07.741 --> 15:10.375

22:03.955 --> 22:06.057
[Corey] Let's make you clean.

22:06.091 --> 22:07.258
Come here.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.394
[Corey] Hi, beautiful.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.229
Yeah, he's so dirty.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.106
I'm excited to see what
different ideas she has, for sure.

22:43.729 --> 22:45.963
[Evelin speaking]

23:04.049 --> 23:06.517
Hopefully it's
not too expensive,

23:06.519 --> 23:10.354
and I wanna make sure that
we have it for a good price.

23:12.224 --> 23:16.894
I was hoping that you might be able
to help out with some of the costs too.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.062
[laughs]

23:24.403 --> 23:26.337
[Evelin speaking]

23:47.426 --> 23:49.560
We can do a nice wedding
without having to spend,

23:49.562 --> 23:51.762
like, thousands
and thousands of dollars

23:51.764 --> 23:53.397
or something
and it can still be nice.

24:01.406 --> 24:02.706
No, yeah. Totally... I just...

24:02.708 --> 24:05.509
Sorry, I'm just getting nervous
and I know it's gonna be great,

24:05.511 --> 24:09.046
I know it's gonna be the best
wedding that you could ever ask for.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.117
<i>[Corey] I know I need
to deliver on this wedding.</i>

24:13.119 --> 24:14.952
Especially since
I'm still on thin ice

24:14.954 --> 24:18.155
with Evelin after she found
out about the girl in Peru.

24:20.559 --> 24:21.859
[Corey speaks Spanish]

24:21.861 --> 24:24.061
Yup, there she is.
All right, let's go.

24:30.569 --> 24:33.070
[speaking Spanish]

24:38.176 --> 24:40.411
This girl is such a good
wedding planner,

24:40.413 --> 24:43.280
she's even planning a wedding
for a Victoria's Secret Angel.

24:44.950 --> 24:48.018
[speaking Spanish]

24:48.053 --> 24:50.054
It's okay?

24:56.061 --> 24:57.361
[Corey] Yeah, let's go.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.031
[Evelin speaking]

25:10.141 --> 25:12.243
Yeah. Here.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.168
[speaking Spanish]

25:54.686 --> 25:55.846
- [Evelin] Good.
- [Corey] Okay.

26:00.191 --> 26:02.726
I would like to just
have, like, an average,

26:02.728 --> 26:06.263
like, total cost
maybe or something.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.400
[Carolina speaking]

26:16.741 --> 26:17.841
[Corey] So what is this?

26:17.843 --> 26:20.678
Oh, are there the different
packages here?

26:20.680 --> 26:23.881
And there is like, this is
the cost of one package

26:23.883 --> 26:26.116
$9,000 and this is the cost...

26:27.819 --> 26:29.353
[Carolina speaking]

26:31.523 --> 26:33.724
Yeah, sorry.
I just... that's...

26:33.726 --> 26:36.060
I was thinking that
this was the total.

26:36.062 --> 26:39.029
The most expensive was $9,800.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.207
[Corey] In Ecuador?

26:55.814 --> 27:01.652
My brother had a wedding in the
United States, it cost him $5,000, okay?

27:01.654 --> 27:04.588
Don't tell me that
we're gonna spend $50,000

27:04.590 --> 27:08.125
to $60,000 on a wedding
in a third-world country.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.931
I believe you're the best
with that kind of money.

27:13.933 --> 27:17.034
I believe anybody could be
the best with that kind of money.

27:18.570 --> 27:20.704
I'm kinda freaking out right now

27:20.706 --> 27:23.641
<i>because I just don't know how
I'm gonna pay for this wedding.</i>

27:23.643 --> 27:26.977
Right now my mind's just...
I'm just concerned,

27:26.979 --> 27:30.214
I just have financial
concerns, is all.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.082
[sighs] I'm screwed, man.

27:35.353 --> 27:38.322
<i>[Ellie] Kelly and Scott know
that Victor cheated on me,</i>

27:38.324 --> 27:41.925
<i>but I haven't even told them
that we're back together.</i>

27:41.927 --> 27:46.864
So there's actually something
that I need to tell you guys.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.199
This isn't actually just a trip.

27:50.835 --> 27:51.969
Wow.

28:10.221 --> 28:14.224
[speaking Spanish]

28:15.894 --> 28:19.096
I'm Kenny, I'm 58 years old.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.132
<i>I used to live in
St. Petersburg, Florida.</i>

28:22.134 --> 28:24.768
But now I live
in La Mision, Mexico,

28:24.770 --> 28:26.670
<i>with my fiance, Armando...</i>

28:26.672 --> 28:28.405
And my daughter Hannah.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.008
- Our daughter.
- Well, yeah, our daughter.

28:31.010 --> 28:36.046
Let me take out the little
cards I made for your lesson.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.115
[Kenny] You brought flash cards?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.184
- [Armando] Yeah.
- [chuckles]

28:40.218 --> 28:42.152
Here's a little quiz, we'll see
how you're doing on your Spanish.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.320
Oh, okay.

28:44.856 --> 28:45.756
[speaking Spanish]

28:45.758 --> 28:46.423
Happy.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.291
[Hannah] Happy.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.959
[Armando] Good job.

28:52.931 --> 28:54.064
Automobile.

28:54.432 --> 28:55.799
[chuckling]

28:55.801 --> 28:57.000
No.

28:57.035 --> 28:58.135
Say it for me.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.405
[speaking Spanish]

29:01.407 --> 29:02.673
[giggles]

29:02.675 --> 29:03.607
- I say it like...
- [Armando] With an accent.

29:03.609 --> 29:07.077
like American. [laughing]

29:07.079 --> 29:11.381
Armando and I first met on a gay
fathers' support group on social media.

29:12.951 --> 29:17.821
<i>We just happened to start
talking in someone else's thread.</i>

29:17.823 --> 29:19.423
- I made him laugh.
- He made me laugh.

29:19.425 --> 29:21.325
[laughing]

29:22.761 --> 29:25.462
<i>[Kenny] We became friends,
and we just went from</i>

29:25.464 --> 29:28.799
<i>talking every so often
to a few times a week</i>

29:28.801 --> 29:31.969
and within a year I said,
"Do you want me to come down?

29:32.137 --> 29:34.037
<i>We can hang out as friends."</i>

29:34.039 --> 29:38.375
And then when we left,
we both knew there was magic.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.744
[laughing]

29:40.746 --> 29:43.781
<i>[Armando] Kenny and I were in
a long-distance relationship</i>

29:43.783 --> 29:46.250
for about three and a half
years, but that wasn't enough.

29:46.252 --> 29:51.121
We needed to be together, and we
did everything possible to come together.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.557
-Give me a hug, bye-bye. Grandpy is leaving.
-Go say bye to Grandpy.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.459
[kid] Bye, Grandpy.

29:55.461 --> 29:59.596
<i>[Kenny] Moving away was a
really hard decision to make.</i>

29:59.598 --> 30:02.065
<i>I had to close up my entire
life and was leaving</i>

30:02.067 --> 30:06.036
my four children and
my grandson back in Florida.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.404
Look, Cooper, wave.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.006
Wave bye.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.107
Bye!

30:10.708 --> 30:13.277
[sobbing]

30:14.579 --> 30:17.581
I actually didn't know what
to expect moving to Mexico

30:17.583 --> 30:21.819
'cause I don't speak Spanish,
but I knew I had to be

30:21.821 --> 30:26.089
with him and, you know,
I have to go for it.

30:27.225 --> 30:28.258
[Hannah speaking]

30:28.860 --> 30:29.993
<i>Malo?</i>

30:30.028 --> 30:33.864
[speaking Spanish]

30:33.866 --> 30:35.899
- Bad.
- [Armando] Bad, yes.

30:35.901 --> 30:36.767
[speaking Spanish then English]

30:36.769 --> 30:38.602
Bad. Good job.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.772
I wanted to start fresh
and new with Kenny

30:41.774 --> 30:43.740
and that's why
I wanted to move out.

30:43.742 --> 30:47.644
<i>But saying goodbye to
my family wasn't easy either.</i>

30:47.646 --> 30:51.348
<i>They didn't even know I was
in a relationship with Kenny.</i>

30:51.350 --> 30:56.520
I didn't think it was possible to
find love and to be with a man.

30:56.522 --> 31:00.958
<i>I'd been married to a woman for
eight years and I had Hannah with her.</i>

31:02.260 --> 31:04.394
<i>But I was struggling
with coming out</i>

31:05.430 --> 31:06.797
[voice breaking] and trying
to make others happy

31:06.799 --> 31:11.568
and never thinking that
I could make myself happy.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.004
<i>But I came out to
my family five years ago.</i>

31:14.839 --> 31:16.607
They didn't accept me being gay,

31:16.609 --> 31:18.308
they didn't wanna see it.

31:19.611 --> 31:23.013
And then Hannah's mother
unexpectedly passed away.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.817
<i>It was a very hard
time in my life,</i>

31:26.819 --> 31:29.253
so that kinda pushed me
back into the closet.

31:30.922 --> 31:35.025
<i>So before moving, I had to tell
my family that I was indeed gay,</i>

31:35.027 --> 31:37.060
<i>I was in a relationship
with a man,</i>

31:37.862 --> 31:40.364
and I was moving away
and bringing Hannah with me.

31:41.432 --> 31:44.268
[speaking Spanish tearfully]

31:55.713 --> 31:57.614
[sobbing]

31:57.616 --> 32:00.384
<i>[Armando] That was a very,
very hard conversation,</i>

32:00.386 --> 32:03.887
but I was still not gonna stop
and hide myself again.

32:03.889 --> 32:07.424
I was moving forward
with my decisions and my life.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.426
[Kenny] Hello?

32:10.395 --> 32:11.895
Baby!

32:11.897 --> 32:14.164
[chuckling]

32:19.003 --> 32:21.104
There's something
I wanna ask you.

32:22.807 --> 32:24.207
And I wanna ask you...

32:26.945 --> 32:29.146
if you will marry me.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.249
[Armando] Of course, yes!

32:33.685 --> 32:36.153
[cheering]

32:38.623 --> 32:42.993
[Kenny] When we got engaged,
it was the best day of my life.

32:42.995 --> 32:47.030
[Armando] But announcing the
engagement to my family was awkward.

32:47.131 --> 32:48.832
Very awkward, right?

32:48.834 --> 32:49.967
It was.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.071
[speaking Spanish]

33:02.613 --> 33:05.148
<i>[Kenny] You could hear
a pin drop for five minutes.</i>

33:05.150 --> 33:07.250
<i>It was like,
"Somebody say something."</i>

33:08.119 --> 33:10.754
It was awkward silence.

33:10.756 --> 33:11.756
Yeah.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.091
[speaking Spanish]

33:17.595 --> 33:18.595
[sighs]

33:25.737 --> 33:27.871
Kenny and I haven't set our date

33:27.873 --> 33:31.775
for our wedding because we
had the pandemic to deal with.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.417
<i>But we are starting
to plan our wedding.</i>

33:34.579 --> 33:38.315
[speaking Spanish]

33:58.369 --> 34:00.537
I'm very excited
to start putting my ideas

34:00.539 --> 34:02.973
down on a board, Kenny's ideas,

34:02.975 --> 34:07.044
and just hopefully everything
that's on the board can come to life.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.147
What are you up to?

34:10.149 --> 34:11.348
Hey.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.950
Getting the vision board.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.519
Are you helping?

34:15.521 --> 34:17.020
- Yes.
- Yes?

34:17.855 --> 34:20.424
I mean, obviously,
I might've gone a little...

34:20.426 --> 34:21.124
- Overboard?
- A little...

34:21.126 --> 34:21.925
[speaking Spanish]

34:21.927 --> 34:24.528
Added a few little things.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.064
<i>[Kenny] Armando has
his vision board.</i>

34:27.066 --> 34:31.134
I think if he had it his way
he'd have a vision wall.

34:31.136 --> 34:35.238
So have you started making
a guest list yet on your end?

34:35.240 --> 34:37.040
That's next.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.208
How many are you talking?

34:40.111 --> 34:41.244
Uh...

34:42.713 --> 34:43.947
Like 100.

34:45.116 --> 34:47.117
You have 100 people to invite?

34:48.352 --> 34:49.986
Plus your people.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.760
In Mexico it's very common
to invite all your family, friends,

34:56.762 --> 34:59.096
people in the neighborhood,
you know, to your wedding.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.764
Not limited by a number, so...

35:00.766 --> 35:02.199
We are. [chuckles]

35:03.935 --> 35:08.972
But, like, what about
your family's involvement?

35:08.974 --> 35:13.977
Are you still worried about, like, talking
to them about it in the first place?

35:15.713 --> 35:16.847
I don't worry about
talking about it,

35:16.849 --> 35:20.984
I'm just worried about
if they're coming or not.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.323
[Kenny] Did your mom
ever tell your dad?

35:31.662 --> 35:33.096
I never asked her.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.834
What was your husband's reaction

35:37.836 --> 35:41.271
when you told him
Armando was engaged?

35:45.243 --> 35:47.177
[speaking Spanish]

35:48.980 --> 35:49.980
Oh...

35:53.251 --> 35:56.219
[speaking Spanish]

36:04.795 --> 36:08.031
[Kenny] So he might not even know
you're engaged yet after all this time.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.099
[Armando] Yeah.

36:09.133 --> 36:10.200
[exhales]

36:12.170 --> 36:14.371
[Kenny] So the wedding's
not even be on his radar.

36:15.606 --> 36:16.606
Wow.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.745
Wait, do we have
to talk with your parents?

36:21.747 --> 36:23.947
Yeah.

36:23.949 --> 36:27.150
[Kenny] And hopefully everybody's
on board and will be supportive.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.052
Mmm-hmm.

36:32.557 --> 36:35.025
Well, we'll see when we go.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.945
-[Scott] Hey, Ellie. Come on in.
-Hey, how's it going?

36:54.947 --> 36:56.646
Hey, guys.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.215
- [John] Hey!
- [Ellie] How is it going?

36:58.217 --> 37:00.850
It smells super good in here.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.720
I'm moving to Providencia
in four days

37:03.722 --> 37:06.890
and I'm gonna miss Thanksgiving,

37:06.892 --> 37:12.729
so my friends decided to throw a
Friendsgiving for me before I go.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.231
[John] Too many cooks.
Too many cooks.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.398
I brought some wine.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.467
Ooh!

37:17.469 --> 37:20.136
Hiromi's one of the
only people that I've told

37:20.138 --> 37:23.173
about this move because
she's my best friend.

37:23.175 --> 37:24.574
Thank you.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.245
The rest of my friends think that I'm
just going to Colombia on vacation.

37:28.713 --> 37:31.581
<i>Kelly and Scott know
that Victor cheated on me,</i>

37:31.583 --> 37:35.218
<i>but I haven't even told them
that we're back together.</i>

37:35.220 --> 37:39.189
So I'm nervous to tell them
that I'm moving to Providencia.

37:39.191 --> 37:42.993
Thanks for making this dinner,
you guys. It's very delicious.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.628
Mmm!

37:44.630 --> 37:47.063
You're leaving this week, right?

37:47.065 --> 37:48.865
- Yeah, so, soon.
- [Hiromi] Okay.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.400
Mmm-hmm.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.369
- Oh, my gosh.
- How long are you staying for?

37:52.903 --> 37:55.939
So, there's actually
something I need

37:55.941 --> 37:58.908
to tell you guys that I've
been keeping from you

37:58.910 --> 38:01.378
'cause I've been a little
bit nervous about it.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.682
This isn't actually just a trip.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.084
I'm back together with Victor

38:08.086 --> 38:11.221
and it's the beginning
of me moving down there...

38:12.056 --> 38:13.123
permanently.

38:14.825 --> 38:16.159
Wow.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.894
[Kelly] Well, have you
already decided this?

38:17.896 --> 38:21.898
Are you, like, tentatively
planning this?

38:21.900 --> 38:24.401
[Hiromi] She's selling
all her stuff.

38:24.403 --> 38:27.170
She's selling her
business, basically.

38:28.706 --> 38:31.374
<i>[Kelly] I think it's a little
crazy for Ellie to move</i>

38:31.376 --> 38:35.445
down there after Victor had
cheated on her earlier this year.

38:35.447 --> 38:37.781
<i>I knew she was kinda
talking to him a little bit,</i>

38:37.783 --> 38:40.383
but I didn't think it was so
serious that she was actually

38:40.385 --> 38:42.619
going to be planning
a move down there.

38:42.621 --> 38:44.421
And I had no idea that
this conversation

38:44.423 --> 38:46.423
was even happening between
these two anymore.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.757
That it was done.
No idea.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.359
So, yeah, we're pretty stunned.

38:50.394 --> 38:54.698
What if you find out
that it was not just her...

38:54.700 --> 38:56.833
I would just walk away.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.368
After you sell your stuff and...

38:59.670 --> 39:02.872
It's kinda tough, 'cause I
want my friends to support me.

39:02.874 --> 39:07.544
<i>I wish that maybe I wouldn't
have told anybody what he did</i>

39:07.546 --> 39:11.181
so that neither one of us
is getting that judgement.

39:11.816 --> 39:14.084
That seems like a huge
choice to forgive

39:14.086 --> 39:16.786
and uproot your life
and move down there.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.521
[Ellie] It is a huge choice.

39:18.523 --> 39:19.889
I'm just worried
he's catching you

39:19.891 --> 39:23.626
at a really vulnerable time
because of Covid and...

39:23.628 --> 39:26.062
[John] He's not
sacrificing anything.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.464
Yeah, he's not
sacrificing anything.

39:27.466 --> 39:30.734
But he was going to. Like,
he was gonna come here...

39:30.736 --> 39:32.936
- Sure.
- .And he was gonna do the same thing.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.938
But you didn't cheat on him.

39:34.972 --> 39:36.005
Yeah.

39:36.007 --> 39:38.341
I just want you
to think about that.

39:38.343 --> 39:39.576
Yeah, I mean, I understand.

39:39.578 --> 39:43.313
What makes you feel
like you can trust him now?

39:43.315 --> 39:50.086
He sounds trustworthy, all the effort
he tried to, like, you know, get me back.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.956
For me, I just want to make
sure that you're protecting yourself

39:52.958 --> 39:56.659
and he's, you know,
not just being very charming.

39:56.661 --> 39:59.262
Yeah, I mean,
he is super charming.

39:59.264 --> 40:04.968
But, you know, I'm hoping
that I would see through that.

40:04.970 --> 40:09.439
Does he know a lot about your
financials and, like, how much you have,

40:09.441 --> 40:11.408
and have you ever
discussed that with him?

40:11.410 --> 40:16.479
I mean, I don't talk
about my financials with him.

40:16.481 --> 40:23.920
Obviously, he's got to assume I'm
doing okay because I own a business.

40:23.922 --> 40:27.857
I've flown to Colombia
like five times, you know?

40:27.859 --> 40:28.725
So...

40:28.727 --> 40:30.460
[Kelly] I have a question.

40:30.462 --> 40:34.798
Does he pay for things
or do you pay for things?

40:34.800 --> 40:37.667
I pay for more things,
but he pays for things too.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.803
He doesn't ask you
to pay for things?

40:39.805 --> 40:42.639
I've been helping him,
like, with the house

40:42.641 --> 40:44.674
- just because I'm moving...
- Wait a minute.

40:44.676 --> 40:45.542
- Hold the phone.
- Yeah, what?

40:45.544 --> 40:47.977
I mean, I've been helping him

40:47.979 --> 40:50.880
- because I want to live there.
- [Kelly] Cause you're gonna live there?

40:50.882 --> 40:55.418
And I'm like, I want, like,
a quality bathroom, you know?

40:55.420 --> 40:56.719
So...

40:56.721 --> 41:00.256
The house that Victor
and I will live in,

41:00.258 --> 41:04.360
<i>Victor has been building
and it's pretty basic.</i>

41:04.362 --> 41:08.865
Like, it has a bathroom,
there's no hot water.

41:08.867 --> 41:13.837
<i>A very small kitchen and then
just a little, like, kinda loft upstairs.</i>

41:13.839 --> 41:16.973
<i>But it's right on the water.</i>

41:17.942 --> 41:19.976
How much have you been
giving him for house repairs?

41:19.978 --> 41:21.578
Like $5,000.

41:21.580 --> 41:22.579
[Hiromi] What [bleep]?

41:22.581 --> 41:25.348
That's not a lot
for all the stuff...

41:25.350 --> 41:29.986
Maybe not a lot for you, but I
guarantee you it's a lot for him.

41:30.855 --> 41:37.026
Have you ever thought about
doing a background check on Victor?

41:37.862 --> 41:42.899
I mean, I haven't really
thought about doing one.

41:42.901 --> 41:47.237
[Kelly] Are you worried
about finding out more

41:47.239 --> 41:49.272
than what he's told you
when you get there?

41:49.406 --> 41:50.940
No.

41:51.775 --> 41:55.545
I'm not worried about doing
a background check on Victor

41:55.547 --> 42:00.083
because I believe he's told me
the truth about his past.

42:00.784 --> 42:03.753
<i>He told me that nine
years ago he got</i>

42:03.755 --> 42:06.422
<i>a domestic violence charge
for an incident</i>

42:06.424 --> 42:09.425
between him
and his daughter's mom.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.997
<i>I admit that when he first
told me about it,</i>

42:13.999 --> 42:15.832
I was completely freaked out,

42:15.834 --> 42:19.402
but then he explained to me
that he walked in

42:19.404 --> 42:23.806
on his ex-girlfriend and
another guy in bed together.

42:23.808 --> 42:28.378
I don't condone what he did,
but I have since spoken

42:28.380 --> 42:31.881
to his ex about it and now
they have a good relationship.

42:31.883 --> 42:35.251
She feels he's a good person,
so I feel comfortable

42:35.253 --> 42:37.353
moving forward with
our relationship.

42:39.957 --> 42:41.157
Wow.

42:42.660 --> 42:44.060
A lot's come out tonight.

42:45.029 --> 42:48.498
I'm surprised you're just
so quick to make,

42:48.500 --> 42:50.867
like, these forever plans.

42:50.869 --> 42:53.603
You're just kinda
cutting ties with up here.

42:53.605 --> 42:57.473
[Ellie] I'm sick of being,
like, you know, alone up here.

42:57.475 --> 43:00.643
And... you know, even though
he [bleep] me over,

43:00.645 --> 43:04.180
I love him, and we have
a good time together.

43:05.883 --> 43:09.085
And I have not had that
up here in a long time.

43:09.853 --> 43:11.054
I'm sorry.

43:11.221 --> 43:12.021
[sobs softly]

43:12.023 --> 43:13.389
Yeah.

43:16.694 --> 43:19.562
[Scott] I can't say it is the right
decision for you, I don't know.

43:19.564 --> 43:22.031
But go for it,
try something new and...

43:22.033 --> 43:24.667
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

43:24.669 --> 43:25.702
Yeah.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.403
I really want it to work for you

43:27.405 --> 43:28.771
and want you
to be happy. So...

43:28.773 --> 43:32.075
I mean, you guys
are like my family, you know?

43:32.710 --> 43:34.844
[Kelly] You're the Ellie
to my Kelly.

43:34.846 --> 43:38.014
[sobbing dramatically]
What am I gonna do?

43:38.782 --> 43:41.584
<i>[Ellie] I appreciate
my friends' concerns.</i>

43:41.586 --> 43:44.520
<i>I know that they're just
looking out for my best interests.</i>

43:44.522 --> 43:47.757
<i>Like, in the back
of my head I'm like,</i>

43:47.759 --> 43:53.329
"Yeah, I'm the one that has more to
give up and I'm giving up everything."

43:54.798 --> 43:56.165
I love you guys.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.001
I love you too.

44:01.005 --> 44:03.072
Andro!

44:03.941 --> 44:05.375
[Biniyam speaking]

44:08.846 --> 44:10.680
Yeah, he wants to run.

44:10.682 --> 44:13.116
[speaking other language]

44:37.441 --> 44:39.042
[speaking other language]

44:40.744 --> 44:42.845
<i>[Ariela] Bini and I are on our
way to pick my ex-husband,</i>

44:42.847 --> 44:45.048
Leandro, up from his hotel.

44:45.050 --> 44:48.384
Try not to be rude
to Leandro, okay?

44:57.828 --> 44:58.828
Mask kiss?

45:01.799 --> 45:03.733
Bini and Leandro have
never met face-to-face.

45:03.735 --> 45:06.736
This is gonna be the first
time meeting in person.

45:06.738 --> 45:10.006
And I'm feeling a little bit
anxious because I know Bini

45:10.008 --> 45:12.075
is not totally
comfortable with it,

45:12.077 --> 45:16.212
<i>but the relationship is over, and Bini
needs to see that. I hope he will see that.</i>

45:18.182 --> 45:20.149
Anyways, we're here.

45:26.023 --> 45:27.090
Breathe.

45:30.094 --> 45:32.061
[Ariela] Andro!

45:38.001 --> 45:39.235
Hey, Andro!

45:39.803 --> 45:40.803
[Leandro speaking]

45:45.075 --> 45:46.976
[both chuckling]

45:46.978 --> 45:48.311
Look at all this stuff.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.113
Wow!

45:50.115 --> 45:51.247
[Biniyam speaking]

45:52.015 --> 45:52.915
[Leandro speaking]

45:52.917 --> 45:53.917
[Ariela] Hug. A hug!

46:08.198 --> 46:10.500
You look like
such a nerd with your mask.

46:10.502 --> 46:13.136
[laughing]

46:21.812 --> 46:23.780
[Ariela] So, are you excited
to see where I live?

46:23.782 --> 46:24.580
Where we live?

46:24.582 --> 46:25.582
[Leandro speaking]

46:26.717 --> 46:28.785

46:36.928 --> 46:40.096

live with us and learn more.

48:00.410 --> 48:02.044
[Ariela] This is Mimi.

48:02.046 --> 48:03.946
Mimi's Avi's nanny and
my best friend from Ethiopia.

I know.

48:14.725 --> 48:15.858
Yeah!

48:15.860 --> 48:16.559
This is your Uncle Andro.

48:16.561 --> 48:19.829
Hello!

48:19.831 --> 48:22.965
You could've had a baby like
this, but you didn't. You missed out.

48:25.802 --> 48:26.802
Uh...

48:36.179 --> 48:37.213
[all chuckling]

48:37.748 --> 48:39.181
Oh!

48:40.918 --> 48:43.786
[Ariela] Yeah, he's really
comfortable with Andro.

48:43.788 --> 48:46.155

with Andro?

but it's very comfortable.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.400
Not ever.

56:35.191 --> 56:35.557
[Sumit speaking]

56:35.559 --> 56:37.459
[Jenny] Okay.

56:37.461 --> 56:41.597
It's been a few days now since I
thought my visa extension was denied

56:41.599 --> 56:44.366
and I thought I was gonna be
going back to America.

56:45.769 --> 56:50.839
And I freaked out
and got very upset.

56:50.841 --> 56:53.409
<i>I mean,
that happening to me was...</i>

56:53.411 --> 56:56.278
It's something that I dread,
I've been dreading.

56:59.749 --> 57:04.186
I'm still upset about what
happened, you know, with my visa.

57:04.188 --> 57:09.425
Luckily it was just a glitch, but
what if that would've been real?

57:13.763 --> 57:16.865
<i>[Jenny] I reapplied for a visa extension
'cause I said, "This can't be right.</i>

57:16.867 --> 57:18.700
Something is wrong here."

57:18.702 --> 57:22.738
<i>This time it came back approved.</i>

57:22.740 --> 57:25.541
Must've been some sort of
clerical error or something,

57:25.543 --> 57:28.110
<i>but I'm getting fed up.</i>

57:28.112 --> 57:30.813
<i>How many times can you ask
me to keep coming back and forth?</i>

57:30.815 --> 57:32.514
I just can't keep doing this.

57:32.516 --> 57:35.551
<i>So we're going to see
an immigration lawyer</i>

57:35.553 --> 57:39.054
to find a more permanent
solution for me to stay in India.

57:44.394 --> 57:46.395
- [receptionist] Hello.
- [Jenny] Hi, good morning.

57:49.466 --> 57:51.733
[receptionist speaking]

57:51.735 --> 57:55.938
I'm pretty nervous because if
Sumit is never gonna marry me,

57:55.940 --> 58:00.075
<i>I don't know if there's any
other way for me to stay in India.</i>

58:02.879 --> 58:05.214
<i>- [Jenny] Namaste.
- [men speaking Hindi]</i>

58:12.755 --> 58:15.224
[Sumit speaking]

58:26.903 --> 58:27.536
[Shailendar speaking]

58:27.538 --> 58:29.037
[Sumit speaking]

58:40.416 --> 58:45.153
No. I mean, there's just no
way that I would ever do that.

58:46.256 --> 58:50.259
And then I would have to give
up, like, my benefits that I get.

58:50.994 --> 58:53.795
I worked my whole life,
I earned those benefits.

58:53.797 --> 58:55.364
There's no way
I'm gonna give those up.

58:59.335 --> 59:00.836
No. Not happening.

59:00.838 --> 59:05.607
That's where I'm from, that's where
my kids are and my grandkids are there.

59:05.609 --> 59:08.844
I'll do what I have to do
to stay here, but really,

59:08.846 --> 59:11.580
seriously, I need to draw
the line somewhere.

59:11.582 --> 59:14.917
And if Sumit is not
willing to marry me,

59:14.919 --> 59:16.752
then why should I even
think about giving up

59:16.754 --> 59:19.187
my American citizenship?

59:22.258 --> 59:25.260
I would never give up
my American citizenship.

59:44.914 --> 59:45.914
No.

59:56.726 --> 59:57.726
Yeah.

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:05.867
Me becoming
a Hare Krishna devotee?

1:00:05.869 --> 1:00:08.103
[chuckling]

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:09.738
<i>I've seen
the Hare Krishna people,</i>

1:00:09.740 --> 1:00:14.409
and they're dancing <i>and singing,
"Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Hare. Hare."</i>

1:00:14.411 --> 1:00:17.646
<i>This is something that is
pretty far-out there for me.</i>

1:00:17.648 --> 1:00:20.215
I'm not even a religious person.

1:00:20.783 --> 1:00:23.752
Okay, so if I apply
for this type of visa,

1:00:23.754 --> 1:00:27.956
do I have to, like,
convince people to join

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:31.994
the Krishna, you know, religion?

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:36.832
[speaking Hindi]

1:00:36.834 --> 1:00:39.401
[Sumit speaking]

1:00:41.004 --> 1:00:45.040
They're giving you this visa
to be part of this religion,

1:00:45.042 --> 1:00:47.042
but you don't have
to do anything?

1:00:47.044 --> 1:00:49.978
That's interesting, I find
that very hard to believe.

1:01:14.270 --> 1:01:16.271
To keep me in India.

1:01:18.941 --> 1:01:23.779
I didn't come to India to become a
Hare Krishna, that was never the plan.

1:01:23.781 --> 1:01:27.749
But it does keep me here
with Sumit in India.

1:01:27.751 --> 1:01:31.386
So it's an area that I'm
willing to explore, actually.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:36.792
Okay, well,
let me just wrap my mind

1:01:36.794 --> 1:01:41.029
around this idea because
this is, like, "What?"

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:43.398
I'm gonna really think
about it, I'm...

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:46.001
doing some heavy soul-searching.

1:02:05.988 --> 1:02:10.892
When I broke the news to my
friends that I was moving to Providencia

1:02:10.894 --> 1:02:13.328
with Victor,
they were pretty shocked.

1:02:14.864 --> 1:02:17.466
<i>Basically, no one thinks
this is a good idea</i>

1:02:17.468 --> 1:02:20.068
<i>and I understand where
they're coming from.</i>

1:02:20.670 --> 1:02:23.605
I just feel like I need
some sort of reassurance

1:02:23.607 --> 1:02:26.975
from Victor that I'm making
the right decision

1:02:26.977 --> 1:02:30.979
to give up everything
and move down there.

1:02:32.115 --> 1:02:33.415
[videocall ringing]

1:02:36.686 --> 1:02:38.019
Hi.

1:02:39.088 --> 1:02:41.056
I'm good, how are you?

1:02:41.624 --> 1:02:43.425
Your beard looks good.

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:53.568
That's the entirety
of our relationship, though.

1:02:53.570 --> 1:02:56.171
You've been growing that
since we met.

1:02:57.807 --> 1:03:01.276
[chuckles]
That's a weird symbol.

1:03:01.911 --> 1:03:06.681
So last night I had a dream

1:03:06.683 --> 1:03:10.986
and the other woman
you cheated on me with,

1:03:10.988 --> 1:03:13.855
we were together,
and she was pregnant.

1:03:13.890 --> 1:03:15.824
<i>Ah.</i>

1:03:15.826 --> 1:03:20.195
And I woke up and I was,
like, super, super upset.

1:03:21.597 --> 1:03:24.766
I know, so it still hurt
like it was real.

1:03:24.768 --> 1:03:27.035
And it just, like,
brought everything back.

1:03:29.872 --> 1:03:35.010
You're for sure
she's not on the island, 100%?

1:03:43.953 --> 1:03:47.789
I definitely haven't
completely moved past that

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:49.591
if I'm still dreaming about it.

1:03:49.625 --> 1:03:52.761
But I hadn't thought about it

1:03:52.763 --> 1:03:58.133
for a while and Friendsgiving dinner
just, like, brought up all this [bleep].

1:03:59.569 --> 1:04:04.239
I'm not ignoring my friends' concerns
about, you know, the cheating.

1:04:04.874 --> 1:04:08.410
But I will always give
somebody a second chance.

1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:19.855
Usually when you love people,
you don't cheat on them.

1:04:19.857 --> 1:04:22.023
That's the problem.

1:04:34.270 --> 1:04:38.006
Yeah, well, you're gonna
apologize for a long time.

1:04:38.507 --> 1:04:42.210
I feel like Victor's
a soulmate for me,

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:45.981
and I don't know if you can
explain why people are soulmates,

1:04:45.983 --> 1:04:48.884
<i>but even though we have
all these unresolved issues,</i>

1:04:48.886 --> 1:04:53.355
I'm taking this leap of faith
and I'm moving to Providencia.

1:04:56.726 --> 1:04:58.994
Obviously when I get there,
we'll have to talk

1:04:58.996 --> 1:05:01.029
a little bit more about it.

1:05:05.968 --> 1:05:09.271
How is the house coming?

1:05:28.190 --> 1:05:29.224
Yeah.

1:05:33.829 --> 1:05:35.096
Yeah.

1:05:41.470 --> 1:05:44.039
Providencia is in the Caribbean,

1:05:44.041 --> 1:05:46.641
but it really doesn't get
that many hurricanes.

1:05:46.643 --> 1:05:50.845
It has tropical storms
and the rainy season,

1:05:50.847 --> 1:05:53.148
but not really
that many hurricanes.

1:06:00.523 --> 1:06:01.957
Oh, my God.

1:06:04.527 --> 1:06:08.063
I just hope that you guys
don't get hit that hard.

1:06:08.831 --> 1:06:12.400
That's really scary
because Hurricane Katrina

1:06:12.402 --> 1:06:17.405
made landfall as a category 3
and it did a ton of damage.

1:06:17.407 --> 1:06:21.343
Providencia is just a tiny rock
in the middle of the Caribbean

1:06:21.345 --> 1:06:24.946
and there's, like,
literally no place to go.

1:06:25.614 --> 1:06:30.285
<i>Most of the structures are just
very basic and made out of wood.</i>

1:06:30.287 --> 1:06:34.990
Like, there's just literally no
place to go, no place to hide.

1:06:34.992 --> 1:06:39.828
<i>I can't imagine what it's like for
Victor being on the island right now.</i>

1:06:39.830 --> 1:06:41.997
I would totally be freaking out.

1:06:42.231 --> 1:06:44.699
Stay safe, please.

1:06:44.701 --> 1:06:45.934
Stay safe.

1:06:45.936 --> 1:06:48.136
I miss you, I love you.

1:06:49.939 --> 1:06:51.406
[chuckling] Bye.

1:06:55.945 --> 1:06:57.779
I'm really excited
about planning

1:06:57.781 --> 1:06:58.947
our wedding with Armando.

1:06:58.949 --> 1:07:02.951
From dancers to fireworks,
especially since you're paying.

1:07:02.953 --> 1:07:05.020
Don't turn into a bridezilla.

1:07:05.054 --> 1:07:06.187
[chuckling]

1:07:23.973 --> 1:07:27.108
[speaking Spanish]

1:07:28.344 --> 1:07:29.477
[kid speaking]

1:07:30.046 --> 1:07:32.013
Today I'm dropping Hannah
off with our neighbor, Ivette,

1:07:32.015 --> 1:07:34.115
so we can go and see
the wedding planner.

1:07:34.117 --> 1:07:35.717
Thanks for watching her.

1:07:35.719 --> 1:07:38.219
We found a guy on social
media, his name is Hugo

1:07:38.221 --> 1:07:39.654
and we're gonna be
meeting with him

1:07:39.656 --> 1:07:42.123
and his assistant, Carlos,
and talking to him

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:44.225
about our wedding one
town over at a restaurant.

1:07:46.429 --> 1:07:49.631
They know the area,
they know different vendors.

1:07:49.633 --> 1:07:52.434
<i>We wouldn't know the first
thing to do, honestly.</i>

1:07:52.436 --> 1:07:54.636
I think it'll just
be a lot easier.

1:07:54.638 --> 1:07:58.873
I hope he has some kind of
portfolio of different weddings he did.

1:07:58.875 --> 1:08:01.476
'Cause there's a lot of
different people you work with.

1:08:01.478 --> 1:08:03.711
Photographers, caterers...

1:08:03.713 --> 1:08:07.115
Hopefully, he can helps us
in everything we need.

1:08:07.850 --> 1:08:10.151
From dancers to fireworks,

1:08:11.420 --> 1:08:12.987
especially since you're paying.

1:08:13.022 --> 1:08:14.155
Shush.

1:08:15.191 --> 1:08:16.024
Fireworks?

1:08:16.026 --> 1:08:17.725
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:08:17.727 --> 1:08:19.227
- Like Fourth of July?
- Yeah.

1:08:19.229 --> 1:08:21.196
In Mexico we go all out.

1:08:21.664 --> 1:08:22.964
I like it big.

1:08:23.399 --> 1:08:24.732
[chuckling]
Oh, my God.

1:08:24.734 --> 1:08:26.734
The wedding.

1:08:26.736 --> 1:08:30.371
Well, don't turn into
a bridezilla. [chuckling]

1:08:34.410 --> 1:08:36.544
I'm really excited about
planning our wedding

1:08:36.546 --> 1:08:38.913
with Armando, especially
with all of the hell

1:08:38.915 --> 1:08:41.316
we went through at
the marriage office.

1:08:41.784 --> 1:08:45.420
What does it say
the denial is for?

1:08:45.422 --> 1:08:50.992
To guarantee and to save,
like, the human species.

1:08:51.961 --> 1:08:53.828
Huh.

1:08:53.830 --> 1:08:57.966
<i>[Kenny] But now that Armando and I finally
got approval on our marriage license</i>

1:08:57.968 --> 1:09:00.368
it feels like everything's
falling into place.

1:09:01.103 --> 1:09:02.237
Armando.

1:09:02.905 --> 1:09:04.139
Ken.

1:09:04.141 --> 1:09:05.974
[speaking Spanish]

1:09:05.976 --> 1:09:07.742
Very good.
How are you doing?

1:09:07.744 --> 1:09:09.410
Thanks for meeting with us.

1:09:09.412 --> 1:09:11.679
It makes me more comfortable
to be working with Hugo

1:09:11.681 --> 1:09:13.114
and Carlos because
they're both gay

1:09:13.116 --> 1:09:15.416
and it'll be interesting
to get their insight.

1:09:15.418 --> 1:09:16.885
[speaking Spanish]

1:09:16.887 --> 1:09:18.153
[all chuckling]

1:09:26.228 --> 1:09:27.896
[Kenny] Better than my Spanish.

1:09:27.898 --> 1:09:29.464
[all laugh]

1:09:29.466 --> 1:09:30.832
[Hugo speaking Spanish]

1:09:30.834 --> 1:09:33.034
- [Armando] We've been together how many?
- Four years.

1:09:33.036 --> 1:09:36.004
But almost a year together.

1:09:36.006 --> 1:09:37.138
- [Hugo speaking]
- Living together.

1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:39.240
We were long-distance, yeah.

1:09:41.110 --> 1:09:46.881
It's a little slower pace. So it's a little
bit getting used to, but he's worth it.

1:09:46.883 --> 1:09:51.986
So what's an average wedding
in the valley would cost, you think?

1:09:51.988 --> 1:09:56.124
We're talking, like,
50 to 100 people.

1:09:57.226 --> 1:09:58.860
Not 50 and not 100.

1:09:58.862 --> 1:10:00.261
Possibly 200.

1:10:01.797 --> 1:10:04.132
- Possibly 100.
- [all laughing]

1:10:05.401 --> 1:10:06.968
[Kenny] Oh, my God.

1:10:07.169 --> 1:10:08.203
You're fired.

1:10:08.205 --> 1:10:09.837
[all laughing]

1:10:09.839 --> 1:10:10.838
You're out.

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:13.041
How do you say
"Fired" in Spanish?

1:10:13.876 --> 1:10:15.109
I definitely will be the bad cop

1:10:15.111 --> 1:10:17.979
with the wedding planners,
I can already tell you that.

1:10:17.981 --> 1:10:18.880
And I can't say no.

1:10:18.882 --> 1:10:20.882
It's usually, like,
if they give me ideas,

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:22.484
- "Oh, this would be good."
- "Okay. Okay."

1:10:22.685 --> 1:10:23.985
"No."

1:10:25.988 --> 1:10:28.823
Yeah, we have to work
on how many,

1:10:28.825 --> 1:10:30.692
but it's definitely
not gonna be over 200.

1:10:30.694 --> 1:10:32.126
We'll see.

1:10:40.035 --> 1:10:43.371
Have you done a lot
of same-sex marriage weddings?

1:10:47.409 --> 1:10:49.010
Not in a legal way?

1:10:49.812 --> 1:10:50.745
This is legal.

1:10:50.747 --> 1:10:52.914
[all laughing]

1:10:52.916 --> 1:10:58.920
Have you had problems
with vendors, you know,

1:10:58.922 --> 1:11:03.024
bakers for cake, you know,
waitstaff, venues,

1:11:03.026 --> 1:11:07.362
anything that don't wanna
cater to same-sex couples?

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:19.407
One of my worries all along

1:11:19.409 --> 1:11:23.511
especially when we got hit with
not being able to get our license

1:11:23.513 --> 1:11:26.914
and we had to fight for it, is how many
vendors aren't gonna wanna work with us

1:11:26.916 --> 1:11:32.954
from photographers to dancers
to caterers because we're gay.

1:11:32.988 --> 1:11:35.256
Have you had an issue before?

1:11:45.401 --> 1:11:47.835
For me, I've been
out a long time

1:11:47.837 --> 1:11:50.538
and it's hard for me to deal
with people like that

1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:53.574
because just like it's sad
that people would still, like,

1:11:53.576 --> 1:11:57.412
deny you because
of who you choose to love.

1:12:04.286 --> 1:12:08.656
It definitely makes me feel comfortable
to be working with Hugo and Carlos.

1:12:08.658 --> 1:12:11.259
<i>I can see where they'd
support us every step of the way.</i>

1:12:11.261 --> 1:12:13.027
You know, they're happy for us

1:12:13.029 --> 1:12:17.432
and they're very happy and excited
to plan our wedding from start to finish.

1:12:17.434 --> 1:12:18.866
[speaking Spanish]

1:12:18.868 --> 1:12:22.203
Great meeting you,
it was great meeting you.

1:12:26.742 --> 1:12:30.845
I'm planning to tell
Alina about my past.

1:12:30.847 --> 1:12:34.982
<i>But when she finds out
I'm afraid that her trust in me</i>

1:12:34.984 --> 1:12:38.052
and her faith
may be unrepairable.

1:12:53.402 --> 1:12:55.136
[videocall ringing]

1:12:59.975 --> 1:13:02.143
<i>[Steven] I'm leaving
for Turkey tomorrow</i>

1:13:02.145 --> 1:13:03.578
<i>to be with my girlfriend, Alina,</i>

1:13:03.580 --> 1:13:07.949
and I am so excited.

1:13:07.951 --> 1:13:11.886
<i>We've been dating and talking
on the phone for so long.</i>

1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:14.722
Almost an entire year has passed

1:13:14.724 --> 1:13:16.391
and now the moment's
finally come.

1:13:20.796 --> 1:13:27.034
It's also nerve-wracking, both Alina
and I are really sacrificing so much

1:13:27.036 --> 1:13:28.770
and nearly everything
to be together.

1:13:28.772 --> 1:13:32.006
<i>I just want everything
to go as smooth as possible.</i>

1:13:32.008 --> 1:13:36.778
You look super cute today
and you're my moonlight

1:13:36.780 --> 1:13:39.414
and I'm super glad
you're in my life

1:13:39.416 --> 1:13:41.182
and I like your hair today,
it looks really...

1:13:41.184 --> 1:13:42.083
[makes whooshing sound]

1:13:42.085 --> 1:13:43.251
[chuckling]

1:13:46.922 --> 1:13:47.488
[speaking Russian]

1:13:47.490 --> 1:13:48.656
[both chuckle]

1:13:48.658 --> 1:13:51.626
One thing Alina and I haven't
really had an opportunity

1:13:51.628 --> 1:13:55.897
to really talk about is
both our living arrangements.

1:13:55.899 --> 1:13:57.865
<i>I booked everything,
but I'm kinda nervous</i>

1:13:57.867 --> 1:13:59.967
to share the details with Alina

1:13:59.969 --> 1:14:03.171
because I don't know
how she's gonna feel about it.

1:14:03.939 --> 1:14:04.839
Wow.

1:14:04.841 --> 1:14:05.873
[laughing]

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:08.309
Tomorrow's the big day.

1:14:09.244 --> 1:14:12.079
I can't wait to hug you
and kiss you.

1:14:14.416 --> 1:14:17.251
So, Alina...

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:19.253
Cupcake.

1:14:20.389 --> 1:14:21.222
[speaking Russian]

1:14:21.224 --> 1:14:22.824
[chuckling]

1:14:22.826 --> 1:14:30.431
Something I wanted to tell you was
that I actually booked two apartments.

1:14:32.568 --> 1:14:36.003
One of them I booked for you
and it's a little bit nicer

1:14:36.005 --> 1:14:41.008
and then I booked another one
for me which is just in a hostel.

1:14:46.949 --> 1:14:49.250
- [chuckles awkwardly]
- Yeah.

1:14:49.818 --> 1:14:51.953
I definitely would
prefer staying with you,

1:14:51.955 --> 1:14:54.188
is not that I don't
wanna stay with you.

1:14:55.457 --> 1:14:57.124
You're kinda getting
ready for baptism,

1:14:57.126 --> 1:15:00.261
I just wanna make sure
we do things the right way.

1:15:01.830 --> 1:15:06.701
<i>Chastity is a commandment within the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,</i>

1:15:06.703 --> 1:15:09.337
<i>and if she wants to be baptized,</i>

1:15:09.339 --> 1:15:13.841
the bishop may frown upon
cohabitation before marriage.

1:15:13.843 --> 1:15:16.410
And I think for now
I wanna play it safe

1:15:16.412 --> 1:15:18.746
<i>and get two separate places.</i>

1:15:18.748 --> 1:15:23.150
It'd just be for
that first month or two

1:15:23.152 --> 1:15:27.054
and then once we got married,
then we could live together.

1:15:27.389 --> 1:15:28.389
<i>Mmm-mmm.</i>

1:15:31.660 --> 1:15:32.960
[sighs]

1:15:33.996 --> 1:15:35.530
How about I can stay
at your place

1:15:35.532 --> 1:15:38.866
just the first night, I can
sleep on the couch over there,

1:15:38.868 --> 1:15:42.203
and then the second night
I'll go over to the hostel,

1:15:42.205 --> 1:15:45.306
and you can see how you feel
when you're by yourself?

1:16:23.145 --> 1:16:27.248
I just am afraid that
if we're living together

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:30.017
we might accidentally have sex.

1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:35.690
[speaking Russian]

1:16:35.692 --> 1:16:38.859
And I think you agree
with me that we wanna wait

1:16:38.861 --> 1:16:43.164
until marriage to have sex.

1:16:49.805 --> 1:16:51.005
[chuckles nervously]

1:16:51.807 --> 1:16:54.609
You're very sexy, Alina, so
I think I'd have a hard time.

1:16:54.611 --> 1:17:01.983
For me, the hardest thing about my
religion has been the law of chastity.

1:17:02.784 --> 1:17:06.420
<i>And it's just something
that I am very tempted by</i>

1:17:06.422 --> 1:17:10.091
<i>and something that
I have struggled with.</i>

1:17:21.069 --> 1:17:24.672
One thing I still need
to tell Alina is that...

1:17:24.674 --> 1:17:26.741
I am not a virgin

1:17:26.743 --> 1:17:30.277
and that I've had sexual
relationships in the past.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:35.683
Those are things
that are not endorsed

1:17:35.685 --> 1:17:39.687
by the church and those
are things that I did.

1:17:39.689 --> 1:17:43.724
We can talk about this
more when we're in Turkey

1:17:43.726 --> 1:17:46.627
and for the first night I'll
stay with you for sure, okay?

1:17:46.629 --> 1:17:49.163
And we can talk about it then.

1:17:49.165 --> 1:17:51.365
<i>- [Alina] Okay.
- Okay. Pinky promise.</i>

1:17:55.437 --> 1:17:59.407
I'm planning to tell
Alina about my past

1:17:59.409 --> 1:18:02.877
<i>because it's something she
definitely deserves to know about,</i>

1:18:02.879 --> 1:18:06.914
<i>but when she finds out,
I'm afraid that her trust in me</i>

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:09.350
and her faith
may be unrepairable.

1:18:15.090 --> 1:18:17.425
[Biniyam speaking]

1:18:17.427 --> 1:18:19.260
[Leandro speaking]

1:18:20.996 --> 1:18:26.133
[speaking other language]

1:18:41.983 --> 1:18:43.951
Yeah, I'm tired too.

1:18:44.519 --> 1:18:46.320
He's changing Avi.

1:18:53.662 --> 1:18:55.930
<i>[Ariela] I'm really
happy that my best friend</i>

1:18:55.932 --> 1:18:59.567
<i>and ex-husband Leandro came
all the way to Ethiopia to see me.</i>

1:18:59.569 --> 1:19:01.202
<i>But he's only been here an hour</i>

1:19:01.204 --> 1:19:05.072
and I can already tell there's some
passive-aggressive tension beneath the surface.

1:19:05.741 --> 1:19:06.741
[Ariela] My gosh.

1:19:10.045 --> 1:19:11.045
[Leandro clears throat]

1:19:11.047 --> 1:19:12.279
[Ariela] Anyways...

1:19:15.383 --> 1:19:17.051
[Ariela] Yeah, I wanna see it.

1:19:26.128 --> 1:19:27.361
[Ariela laughing]

1:19:29.965 --> 1:19:32.333
[Biniyam speaking]

1:19:32.335 --> 1:19:34.268
[Leandro speaking]

1:19:42.878 --> 1:19:45.446
Yeah, you know. You can't
get a lot of stuff in Ethiopia.

1:19:46.748 --> 1:19:49.049
My favorite toothpaste.
Thank you.

1:20:12.908 --> 1:20:14.108
[Ariela] Awesome.

1:20:19.614 --> 1:20:22.049
[laughs]

1:20:31.693 --> 1:20:34.361
I really needed bras
because, you know,

1:20:34.363 --> 1:20:36.697
now I'm breastfeeding the
baby. My boobs, they got bigger,

1:20:36.699 --> 1:20:40.134
now they got smaller. You
know, I can't find it here in Ethiopia.

1:20:41.970 --> 1:20:46.073
I can see why it would bother Bini
that I asked my ex to bring me a bra,

1:20:46.075 --> 1:20:50.144
but no one else is coming from my
family anytime soon and I need a bra

1:20:50.146 --> 1:20:53.080
and so far I haven't found
a good quality one here.

1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:00.287
This one's for you.

1:21:29.951 --> 1:21:31.952

1:21:45.634 --> 1:21:48.269
[Biniyam speaking]

1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:02.082
We never actually broke up.
I just never came home.

1:22:09.758 --> 1:22:13.327
<i>[Ariela] I told Leandro that I
would move with him to Indiana,</i>

1:22:14.062 --> 1:22:17.965
but then I decided
I wanted to travel the world.

1:22:20.268 --> 1:22:22.670
<i>We got married when I was 19</i>

1:22:22.672 --> 1:22:25.839
<i>and I just felt like
I needed to explore myself</i>

1:22:25.841 --> 1:22:28.475
and get to know myself better,
and that's why I left.

1:22:29.878 --> 1:22:32.279
Were you mad at me

1:22:32.847 --> 1:22:35.382
when, like, because
the way we broke up?

1:22:36.151 --> 1:22:39.053
And I just told you,
"Oh, I'm not coming."

1:22:39.888 --> 1:22:42.256
[Leandro speaking]

1:22:47.762 --> 1:22:51.665
<i>[Ariela] I know that Leandro had
in his mind that I would come back.</i>

1:22:51.667 --> 1:22:54.535
<i>In the back of my mind I also
thought we would eventually</i>

1:22:54.537 --> 1:22:57.137
get back together again, that's
why I didn't wanna break up with him

1:22:57.139 --> 1:22:59.573
because I was sure this
was just, like, a hiatus.

1:22:59.575 --> 1:23:02.009
And then I met Biniyam.

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:09.984
At the time that I did
that I was too scared...

1:23:11.486 --> 1:23:14.588
to talk directly because
I didn't wanna lose you,

1:23:14.590 --> 1:23:18.092
I wanted to keep the option
open maybe that if...

1:23:19.561 --> 1:23:21.829
If this new life that
I was thinking about

1:23:21.831 --> 1:23:25.399
didn't work out,
I could go back to the life

1:23:25.401 --> 1:23:26.967
I was comfortable with,
which is [bleep]-up,

1:23:26.969 --> 1:23:29.903
because you didn't deserve
that and I'm sorry.

1:23:29.905 --> 1:23:31.405
I actually feel
super bad about it.

1:23:31.673 --> 1:23:33.440
I was very confused.

1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:40.714
[Ariela, tearfully] That makes
me sad because I don't...

1:23:40.716 --> 1:23:43.050
I just feel like
a [bleep] person.

So now that you've been
here for a year,
