00:09.000 --> 00:11.040
(<i> somber, suspenseful</i>
<i> theme playing</i> )

00:21.420 --> 00:23.620
This is the infamous
Lucasville Prison,

00:23.620 --> 00:26.420
where fugitive Lyle Guthrie
is about to be executed

00:26.420 --> 00:28.490
for killing
three Cleveland policemen.

00:28.490 --> 00:30.590
The victims were shot
in cold blood

00:30.590 --> 00:33.060
after responding
to an emergency 911 call

00:33.060 --> 00:35.160
that turned out
to be a trap.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.100
To their fellow officers'
frustration,

00:37.100 --> 00:40.170
Guthrie's date with the electric
chair has been put on hold,

00:40.170 --> 00:43.100
pending extradition proceedings
filed by the state of Texas,

00:43.110 --> 00:45.010
where he's also facing
the death penalty

00:45.010 --> 00:48.140
for the execution-style
murder of a Texas Ranger

00:48.140 --> 00:49.980
prior to the Cleveland slayings.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.750
REPORTER:
<i> The jurisdictional dispute</i>
<i> ended this morning</i>

00:54.750 --> 00:56.020
<i> when a federal judge</i>

00:56.020 --> 00:58.050
<i> denied the extradition request.</i>

01:04.260 --> 01:05.890
<i> Convicted killer</i>
<i> Lyle Guthrie will die--</i>

02:32.080 --> 02:33.710
( breathing heavily )

02:39.660 --> 02:41.860
Come on, baby.
Give it to me.

02:57.310 --> 02:58.440
( phone rings )

03:00.580 --> 03:01.710
Yes?

03:11.020 --> 03:12.520
The stinki''
Supreme Court

03:12.520 --> 03:15.090
says Texas
gets to kill you.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.110
(<i> light rock action theme</i>
<i> playing</i> )

04:22.590 --> 04:24.260
( crash, cat screeches )

04:24.260 --> 04:25.360
Mabel, are you sure

04:25.360 --> 04:27.460
you can run this place
while I'm gone?

04:27.460 --> 04:29.700
If an old sodbuster
like you can run it,

04:29.700 --> 04:33.230
don't you think an intelligent
woman like me can run it?

04:33.240 --> 04:35.140
C.D., Mabel has it
under control.

04:35.140 --> 04:37.070
Okay, okay,
but listen.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.440
If you run out
of goobers

04:38.440 --> 04:40.010
or you run out
of beef jerky,

04:40.010 --> 04:42.140
they're right up in under here
in the preserve jars.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.410
They're right up in under here
in the preserve jars, Mabel.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.310
C.D., that's the fifth time
you've told her that.

04:46.310 --> 04:47.310
Try tenth.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.310
Fifteenth.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.450
Listen, detail, detail.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.350
That's what built
this place down here.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.020
Hey, uh, Walker,

04:53.020 --> 04:55.020
you got any room
in there for these?

04:55.020 --> 04:57.190
What have you
got in there?

04:57.190 --> 04:58.190
Nothin'. I--

05:00.460 --> 05:02.700
Well, you don't
need this.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.830
And you don't need that.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.540
( laughing )

05:08.540 --> 05:10.070
And you definitely
don't need that.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.070
Gimme that.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.970
What am I
supposed to do?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.570
You're supposed to be
at one with nature.

05:14.580 --> 05:15.780
That's what.

05:15.780 --> 05:18.010
I mean, you'll
figure out somethin'.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.980
Jimmy.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.290
Alex, hi. You came
to see us off?

05:26.290 --> 05:27.320
Not exactly.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.960
Uh-oh.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.490
Alex, I just don't like
the sound of that.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.690
Extradition order.
And two tickets to Cleveland.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.030
Walker and Trivette are gonna
go pick up a prisoner.

05:36.030 --> 05:37.200
Now, dadgum it, Alex.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.830
Me and Jimmy
have been planning

05:38.830 --> 05:40.730
this fishing trip
for over a month.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.940
It took forever to get Cordell
to get some time off.

05:43.940 --> 05:44.940
Alex, get somebody else.

05:44.940 --> 05:46.570
I'm looking forward to this.

05:46.570 --> 05:49.940
I could, but I don't think
Walker would want me to.

05:52.410 --> 05:53.880
Lyle Guthrie.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.850
ALEX:
He killed three
Cleveland police officers

05:55.850 --> 05:57.080
before they arrested him.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.690
TRIVETTE:
What's that got
to do with us?

05:58.690 --> 06:01.590
He's been on the top
of our most-wanted
list for three years.

06:01.590 --> 06:04.120
He killed a Ranger,
Trivette...

06:04.130 --> 06:05.790
execution-style.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.700
Now I remember
reading this report.

06:13.130 --> 06:14.470
Ranger's name was Barrett.

06:14.470 --> 06:15.470
Yeah.

06:15.470 --> 06:16.970
Had a wife
and three kids.

06:16.970 --> 06:18.670
Yeah, he did.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.080
ALEX:
What's the matter
with Walker?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.180
I thought
he'd be delighted.

06:27.180 --> 06:32.020
Cordell was godfather
to one of his children.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.120
He feels responsible
for Barrett.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.860
Why?
Yeah, why?

06:35.860 --> 06:36.890
Well, Cordell

06:36.890 --> 06:38.960
was supposed to have
picked up Guthrie.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.790
He got busy
doing somethin' else.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.330
Barrett covered for him.

06:43.330 --> 06:45.070
Guthrie wasted him.

06:54.140 --> 06:58.240
Your contact in Cleveland
will be Lieutenant Levar Dixon.

07:03.650 --> 07:05.690
Barrett was a Ranger.

07:05.690 --> 07:09.720
I'm sure he knew
the risk that was involved.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.030
Yeah, well,
tell his family that.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.970
( chattering, phones ringing )

07:25.310 --> 07:27.310
( chattering stops )

07:29.410 --> 07:30.840
Rangers Walker
and Trivette

07:30.850 --> 07:32.710
to see
Lieutenant Dixon.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.350
( chuckles )

07:38.320 --> 07:40.250
Lieutenant,
yeah, uh,

07:40.260 --> 07:42.920
Roy Rogers and Dale Evans
just rode in.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.930
Easy does it, Dale.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.090
He was looking at you
when he said that, Walker.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.830
Then he'd have
to be cross-eyed.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.700
OFFICER:
Right through that door,
gentlemen.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.400
And, uh, try not to get
any cow patties

07:54.400 --> 07:56.040
on his new wall-to-wall.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.570
( laughs )

07:58.570 --> 07:59.940
Ahem, from the looks
of this place,

07:59.940 --> 08:01.940
it'd be an improvement.

08:08.250 --> 08:09.620
Thanks for your time,
lieutenant.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.650
Don't thank me.

08:10.650 --> 08:12.250
I had no choice.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.790
You know, Walker,
I'm not sensing
the camaraderie

08:14.790 --> 08:17.190
we've come to expect
from Cleveland's finest here.

08:17.190 --> 08:20.290
This slime-bucket
took out three good cops.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.560
Family men,
friends of mine.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.470
That Ranger
was a friend of mine.

08:25.470 --> 08:27.600
Guthrie made him kneel,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.570
beg for mercy.

08:29.570 --> 08:31.770
Then he put a gun
to his head and blew it off.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.640
I want him
to get the chair.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.010
I wanna inflict as much
cruel and unusual punishment

08:36.010 --> 08:37.510
as the law allows.

08:37.510 --> 08:39.809
Lethal injection is
what Texas law allows.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.780
That's why I want him
executed here.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.120
C.P.D. brought him down.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.550
C.P.D. owns him.

08:44.550 --> 08:46.390
TRIVETTE:
Federal court
says otherwise.

08:46.390 --> 08:49.190
Look, he's gonna die
no matter what,

08:49.190 --> 08:51.190
all right?

08:59.800 --> 09:00.900
Lieutenant...

09:01.700 --> 09:03.340
If it means
anything to you,

09:03.340 --> 09:06.610
I'd rather
see him fry too.

09:09.710 --> 09:12.850
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )

09:20.990 --> 09:22.820
The bed's
still warm, babe.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.290
Can't imagine why.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.530
Hey, if you'd
rather peddle headsets

09:26.530 --> 09:28.830
for some airline,
then go ahead.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.870
( giggles ):
Mark.

09:31.870 --> 09:32.870
( knock on door )

09:32.870 --> 09:33.870
Why don't you
get that.

09:33.870 --> 09:34.900
It's probably
Stephanie.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.100
She's always early.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.100
All right.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.680
( shower running )

09:47.150 --> 09:48.150
( yells )

09:48.150 --> 09:49.650
( crash )

10:02.630 --> 10:03.760
( squeaks )

10:03.770 --> 10:06.030
Mark, tell Stephanie
I'll be right out.

10:06.030 --> 10:07.030
( groans )

10:18.510 --> 10:20.750
DIXON:
This is Rangers Walker
and Trivette.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.020
GUTHRIE:
Two Rangers.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.650
I guess they
remember what happened

10:24.650 --> 10:26.420
when they sent only one.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.260
Yeah, I remember, Guthrie.

10:29.260 --> 10:31.020
You know the only thing
I regret?

10:31.030 --> 10:32.690
What's that, Walker?

10:32.690 --> 10:35.560
Is that you and I never got
a chance to go one on one.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.530
Well, come on in here, Ranger.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.370
I'll make that dream come true.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.740
There's nothing
I would like better.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.510
( chuckles )

10:45.510 --> 10:48.310
Get this piece of garbage
outta here.

11:29.620 --> 11:30.820
Hey, handsome.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.820
How's it going?

11:31.820 --> 11:33.320
Good.

11:38.460 --> 11:39.690
Got the special meals?

11:39.690 --> 11:40.690
Right here.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.160
To die for,
just like you ordered.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.200
Hey.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.570
You be careful,
now, you hear?

11:45.570 --> 11:47.730
Yeah. Now, don't you
worry about me.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.210
What the hell?
No way they're gonna let me

11:57.210 --> 11:59.580
on no plane like this.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.980
He's right. Regulations
stipulate handcuffs only.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.680
We're not
on the plane yet.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.290
( door buzzes )

12:17.930 --> 12:19.930
( banging )

12:23.300 --> 12:24.840
Oh, let me help you
with that.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.210
They're always
getting stuck.

12:26.210 --> 12:27.440
Thanks.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.080
You're new
on this run, huh?

12:29.080 --> 12:30.480
Yeah.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.710
You know, you're not gonna get
very far without that.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.050
Oh, my nametag again.
Yeah.

12:35.050 --> 12:37.250
I guess it's
that identity crisis of mine.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.320
Hey, I'm still gettin'
over mine.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.790
I'm Stephanie Marco.

12:40.790 --> 12:44.160
Stephanie. You're a friend
of Linda's, aren't you?

12:44.160 --> 12:45.160
Yeah, I am.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.560
She talks about you
all the time.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.790
As a matter of fact,
this morning she called me

12:48.800 --> 12:50.000
to cover for her last minute.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.430
Yeah, that's weird.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.600
We live in the same building,
and we usually share a taxi,

12:53.600 --> 12:56.340
but she didn't answer
when I knocked this morning.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.570
I guess she left early
or something.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.540
I think it's
the something.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.380
Between you and me,
she and Mark,

13:03.380 --> 13:04.810
they're lighting
the sheets afire.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.810
( chuckling ):
Oh, really.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.310
Nice earrings.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.680
Oh, thank you.

13:39.350 --> 13:40.410
Here's his ticket.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.650
If it was up to me,

13:41.650 --> 13:43.120
he'd be traveling
in the cargo hold.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.480
If it was up to me,
I'd put him in the cargo hold.

13:49.190 --> 13:51.290
Okay, lieutenant,
thanks a lot.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.290
Take care.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.420
Thirty-five?

14:16.420 --> 14:17.920
Yeah.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.190
Uh, excuse me, sir.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.060
I believe
you're in my seat.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.060
My ticket says 35C.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.130
Well, mine too.

14:32.130 --> 14:33.930
There's not enough room
for both of us.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.400
Do we have a problem
here, gentlemen?

14:35.400 --> 14:36.640
Yeah, you bet
your hide, honey.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.100
You got you two 35Cs.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.110
Hm.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.040
Look, miss,
my partner and I

14:43.040 --> 14:44.410
are transporting
a prisoner.

14:44.410 --> 14:47.050
It's very important
that we all sit together.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.210
All right.
I'll handle this.

14:49.220 --> 14:50.850
Uh, Mr. Hollister,

14:50.850 --> 14:53.950
it just so happens we have
one seat left in first class.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.060
And something tells me
it's got your name on it.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.560
Thanks, but no, thanks.

14:57.560 --> 14:58.920
Company keeps putting me
up there,

14:58.930 --> 14:59.990
I keep trading the ticket in

15:00.000 --> 15:01.460
for seats back here.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.230
Sir, I'd really
appreciate it

15:04.230 --> 15:05.930
if you'd make
an exception this time.

15:05.930 --> 15:08.100
Look, partner, I'd like
to help you, really I would,

15:08.100 --> 15:11.040
but, see, I'm in insurance,
Woodrock Life.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.440
Yeah, well,
statistics don't lie.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.810
If this baby goes down,

15:13.810 --> 15:15.710
your chances of survival

15:15.710 --> 15:17.340
increase in direct proportion

15:17.350 --> 15:19.140
to your distance
from the cockpit.

15:19.150 --> 15:20.680
Now, if she can
hustle me up another seat

15:20.680 --> 15:21.880
back here
in the safety zone--

15:21.880 --> 15:23.180
It'll be the dead zone

15:23.180 --> 15:25.150
if you don't move your butt
on out of there, pronto!

15:25.150 --> 15:26.390
You pull that again,

15:26.390 --> 15:28.490
you'll spend the next
four hours on the wheel.

15:28.490 --> 15:30.520
PILOT ( over PA ):
<i> Flight attendants,</i>
<i> secure doors.</i>

15:30.530 --> 15:33.260
Ranger Walker, I'm afraid you'll
have to move to first class.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.360
I'm not gonna let this guy
out of my sight. I'm sorry.

15:35.360 --> 15:36.830
I guess that makes me
odd man out, man.

15:36.830 --> 15:37.830
Yeah, why don't you go.

15:37.830 --> 15:38.860
I'm sorry,
gentlemen,

15:38.870 --> 15:40.730
but Ranger Walker's
assigned to 35C.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.270
And regulations require
that he be the one who moves.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.940
<i> Flight attendants</i>
<i> prepare for departure.</i>

15:44.940 --> 15:46.410
Please, gentlemen,
take your seats.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.470
We're about
to take off.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.980
Please.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.210
Put him in
the middle seat.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.710
If he's trouble,
you know what to do.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.710
I know.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.080
Shoot first
and come find you later.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.780
One more thing,
the handcuffs.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.720
Who has the keys?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.320
I do. Why?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.820
The FAA Requires that
the law enforcement officer

16:04.830 --> 16:06.160
accompanying the prisoner

16:06.160 --> 16:08.490
be in possession
of them at all times...

16:08.500 --> 16:09.700
in case of an emergency.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.970
You understand.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.670
( clinking )

16:13.670 --> 16:14.670
Outside pocket.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.500
This way, please.

16:42.130 --> 16:44.630
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

17:16.300 --> 17:18.060
ATTENDANT ( over PA ):
<i> We'd like to welcome you</i>

17:18.069 --> 17:19.800
<i> to flight 453</i>
<i> to Dallas-Fort Worth.</i>

17:19.800 --> 17:22.130
<i> Our food service will</i>
<i> be commencing shortly.</i>

17:22.140 --> 17:23.869
<i> In the main cabin,</i>
<i> we'll be offering a choice</i>

17:23.869 --> 17:26.210
<i> of chicken a la king,</i>
<i> or beef stroganoff.</i>

17:26.210 --> 17:29.240
<i> We also have</i>
<i> a special vegetarian plate.</i>

17:29.240 --> 17:31.610
<i> And today's in-flight movie</i>
<i> will be</i> An Innocent Man.

17:31.610 --> 17:34.050
Oh. Looks like we're
in special-meal city here.

17:34.050 --> 17:35.280
You want me
to handle them?

17:35.280 --> 17:38.080
No! Actually, there's
a tofu sprouts in 40

17:38.090 --> 17:39.550
who's kinda cute.

17:39.550 --> 17:40.950
( ding )

17:40.960 --> 17:42.020
Oh.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.360
They never give us
a break, do they?

17:44.360 --> 17:45.560
Would you get that one?

17:45.560 --> 17:46.560
Sure.
Thanks.

18:06.010 --> 18:07.380
Can I help you
with something, sir?

18:07.380 --> 18:08.450
Yeah, this is busted.

18:08.450 --> 18:10.180
I can't get
my seat to go back.

18:10.180 --> 18:12.380
Let me see what
I can do here.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.960
This is for the far gentleman.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
Thank you.

18:33.670 --> 18:34.770
Come on, Ranger.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.480
No way I can
chow down in these.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.840
Well, maybe
you'll starve to death

18:37.850 --> 18:40.310
and save the taxpayers
some money.

18:40.310 --> 18:42.150
Could I have an apple juice
with this, please?

18:42.150 --> 18:43.150
Certainly.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.690
Yeah.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.250
I thought you
looked familiar.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.920
Say, I hope you don't have
a policy with Woodrock Life.

18:53.430 --> 18:54.690
I-it's a joke.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.530
It's just a joke.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.930
I hope your policy's
paid up, pal.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.070
You better
sell him one too.

19:01.070 --> 19:02.100
He's gonna need it

19:02.100 --> 19:04.100
sooner than he thinks.

19:09.340 --> 19:10.480
Here's your apple juice.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.180
Thanks.
Flight attendant, uh...

19:12.180 --> 19:14.580
I'm Ranger James Trivette,
35G.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.420
I'm a semi-vegetarian,
so I ordered

19:16.420 --> 19:17.820
the vegetarian special.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.820
You did?

19:19.820 --> 19:21.590
I'm sorry, sir.
We're out of those.

19:21.590 --> 19:23.590
Yeah, but check...

19:26.060 --> 19:27.060
( sighs )

19:35.800 --> 19:38.200
Okay. We have
a vegetarian special.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.270
And the same
for you, sir?

19:39.270 --> 19:40.970
We have plenty
on board.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.070
Ranger Walker?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.080
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.510
Uh...just coffee.

19:44.510 --> 19:45.910
Thanks.
Okay.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.610
Are you sure we can't
open that curtain?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.250
I'm positive.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.680
Regulations.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.490
Uh, Ranger
as in Texas Ranger?

19:54.490 --> 19:55.490
Yes, ma'am.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.760
Oh, really?

19:56.760 --> 19:59.830
My daughter-in-law,
Nadine, is from Texas.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.760
She's the one that made
George move down here.

20:01.760 --> 20:02.830
I know it.

20:02.830 --> 20:04.660
She made him buy
this fancy house.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.960
It's not my taste,

20:05.970 --> 20:08.630
and it's not George's,
either, believe me.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.170
I mean,
all those rooms.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.440
I call it a hotel.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.070
I am always getting lost
in that place.

20:14.070 --> 20:15.070
Can you imagine?

20:15.080 --> 20:16.480
No, ma'am, I can't.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.510
George is in pork bellies.

20:17.510 --> 20:20.250
He's doing very well.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.320
He always sends me
a first-class ticket,

20:22.320 --> 20:23.720
round-trip, of course.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.920
Just between us,

20:25.920 --> 20:28.650
I think Nadine's afraid
that I might stay,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.460
if you know what I mean.

20:30.460 --> 20:31.760
Yes, ma'am.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.030
Uh, would you
excuse me a minute?

20:33.030 --> 20:34.030
Oh.

20:49.780 --> 20:50.910
Ranger Walker, please,

20:50.910 --> 20:52.380
you'll have
to return to your seat.

20:52.380 --> 20:55.080
The captain still hasn't
turned off the seatbelt sign.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.620
Are you sure we
can't open this curtain?

20:56.620 --> 20:58.620
I'm positive.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.860
But to be truthful,
I have thought about it.

21:09.860 --> 21:11.130
Staying, I mean.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.900
She wouldn't even know
we were there.

21:12.900 --> 21:14.970
I mean, Nadine, that's
my daughter-in-law,

21:14.970 --> 21:17.970
well, she made George
buy this huge place.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.270
Well, it's not my taste.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.080
Here's that special meal
you ordered.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.080
Yeah, to die for.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.130
( whispers ):
God.

22:06.550 --> 22:08.590
Everything's going
according to plan.

22:08.590 --> 22:09.760
Not exactly.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.590
Seat mix-up.

22:11.590 --> 22:13.290
His partner ended up
in first class.

22:13.290 --> 22:15.690
You mean,
that's not him?

22:15.700 --> 22:17.200
No.

22:18.530 --> 22:19.930
I'll take care of it.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.610
Prisoner's loose!

22:32.750 --> 22:34.480
Hey! What's going on here?

22:34.480 --> 22:35.680
( yells )
( woman screaming )

22:38.720 --> 22:40.050
Miss, miss,
wait a minute!

22:41.190 --> 22:42.190
GUTHRIE:
Shut up!

22:42.190 --> 22:43.420
Sit down and shut up!

22:43.420 --> 22:45.220
Do it! Or what
happened to him

22:45.230 --> 22:46.760
will happen to you.

23:01.980 --> 23:02.970
( gasps )

23:02.980 --> 23:04.310
Where's the Ranger sitting?

23:04.310 --> 23:05.740
I don't know.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.750
Where, damn it?

23:10.950 --> 23:15.250
Those kids are gonna miss
their mommy real bad.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.920
Five, 4, 3, 2--

23:16.920 --> 23:19.220
He's up front
on the other side.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.360
Freeze!

23:25.370 --> 23:26.370
Stay put. Stay quiet.

23:26.370 --> 23:27.770
Nobody'll get hurt.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.900
Ranger's not here.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.970
He probably slipped
into the cargo hold

23:33.980 --> 23:36.140
or one of the johns.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.240
I'll go check 'em out.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.340
You check into
the cockpit.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.350
Give the crew

23:39.350 --> 23:41.350
their new destination.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.090
Open up.

23:49.190 --> 23:50.460
Open up, or there's gonna be

23:50.460 --> 23:53.460
a lot of dead people in here.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.400
First,

24:00.400 --> 24:03.200
the only heroes on this plane
are dead ones.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.870
Second,

24:04.870 --> 24:06.740
we're revising
the flight plan.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.310
We're headed to
the Cayman Islands now.

24:08.310 --> 24:10.410
You're going to jail
first, honey.

24:10.410 --> 24:11.840
Then you can go

24:11.850 --> 24:13.550
to the Cayman Islands.
Now, sit down.

24:16.550 --> 24:18.420
Tie her up
and gag her.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.050
Say, uh...

24:20.050 --> 24:22.390
you're not gonna fire
that cannon in there, are ya?

24:22.390 --> 24:25.320
This bird'll
depressurize so fast...

24:25.330 --> 24:26.330
All right. This'll do.

24:26.330 --> 24:28.630
You take this one.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.200
He's not in
the cargo hold.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.740
Check on first class again.

24:37.740 --> 24:39.300
See what's keeping Rhonda.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.180
( woman sobbing )
MAN: It's gonna be okay.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.470
Don't make a move.

25:11.470 --> 25:12.470
Let's go.

25:15.780 --> 25:16.780
( banging on door )

25:16.780 --> 25:18.280
It's Walker.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.020
Sit down.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.290
Okay. Two down.
One to go.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.750
You find
a parking spot yet?

25:27.760 --> 25:29.290
Returning to Cleveland's
our best bet.

25:29.290 --> 25:31.220
The tower's just given us
emergency clearance.

25:31.220 --> 25:33.290
We'll be jettisoning fuel
over the lake and going in.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.090
Okay, get it down
as soon as you can.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.100
Tie and gag him up.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.910
(<i> slow electric guitar theme</i>
<i> playing</i> )

25:51.280 --> 25:53.310
Where's the Ranger hiding?
Where?

26:02.020 --> 26:03.390
Here I am, Guthrie.

26:03.390 --> 26:05.060
Drop the gun.

26:06.830 --> 26:10.030
You miss, Walker,
we all go down.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.530
I don't miss.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.430
Neither do we, Ranger.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.350
Right there, Ranger.

26:32.350 --> 26:33.350
Drop it.

26:33.350 --> 26:35.690
Drop it,
or I'll blow you away!

26:35.690 --> 26:37.220
Guthrie goes first.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.420
You think he cares
about you?

26:39.430 --> 26:41.630
Do ya?

26:41.630 --> 26:44.360
You bet your butt
he doesn't.

26:44.370 --> 26:45.430
How 'bout you?

26:45.430 --> 26:47.500
He doesn't know you
from spit, does he?

26:47.500 --> 26:48.800
'Course not,

26:48.800 --> 26:51.740
but somethin' tells me
he's gonna lose

26:51.740 --> 26:52.900
his nerve real quick

26:52.910 --> 26:55.040
the minute it gets personal.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.910
When you killed that Ranger,
it became personal.

27:00.380 --> 27:02.580
Made my day too...

27:02.580 --> 27:04.950
listenin' to him plead
for his life.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.580
"My wife, my kids.

27:06.590 --> 27:07.990
Please, please."

27:07.990 --> 27:11.590
The way his eyes looked
when I popped him.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.290
I get goose bumps
just thinking about it.

27:14.290 --> 27:16.630
Now, you drop that sidearm,

27:16.630 --> 27:18.430
or these good folks
are gonna see

27:18.430 --> 27:20.270
a real cop killer
in action.

27:20.270 --> 27:21.300
Don't do it, Walker.

27:21.300 --> 27:24.200
You got to the count
of ten, cowboy.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.270
Five, 6--

27:25.270 --> 27:26.910
He's gonna do it, anyway.
Walker--

27:26.910 --> 27:29.410
( rumbling )

27:33.310 --> 27:34.780
Guthrie, we're landing.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.880
What are you
talking about?

27:36.880 --> 27:38.380
The airport.
We're going down.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.850
You get this landing
aborted, Walker.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.490
The fuel's been dumped.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.820
We're going down
one way or another.

27:57.940 --> 27:58.940
MAN:
Stay where you are.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.110
Hang on.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.310
( tires screech )

28:20.060 --> 28:21.560
We got
a com hookup yet?

28:21.560 --> 28:22.690
OFFICER:
Yeah, lieutenant.

28:22.700 --> 28:23.930
We patched
into the airport.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.000
Check on Rhonda
and Boland.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.010
Clean out that cabin
and cockpit while you're at it.

28:34.010 --> 28:35.510
( groans )

28:36.740 --> 28:39.340
I want everybody back here
where I can see you.

28:39.350 --> 28:40.580
I don't know,
I don't know.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.310
The Ranger thought he had
all of them but one.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.020
Turned out there's more
on board.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.280
What's Walker's
status now?

28:46.290 --> 28:48.050
<i> A standoff</i>
<i> at last report.</i>

28:48.060 --> 28:49.520
Any casualties?

28:49.520 --> 28:50.960
One wounded.
Poor guy tried to--

28:50.960 --> 28:52.560
( knock on door )

28:52.560 --> 28:54.190
Open up in there!

28:54.190 --> 28:55.190
I got the Ranger.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.500
Open up, or I'll kill him.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.000
They've got Walker.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.870
They're beating on my door.
I'm gonna have to go.

28:59.870 --> 29:01.630
Captain.
Captain, listen.

29:08.140 --> 29:10.680
Okay.

29:27.290 --> 29:28.790
How is he?

29:28.800 --> 29:30.660
I can't stop
the bleeding

29:30.660 --> 29:32.760
and his pulse
is very weak.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.070
Where do you think
you're going, Ranger?

29:37.070 --> 29:38.370
I'm going to see
if I can help.

29:38.370 --> 29:40.470
Who's gonna help you
when you're dying?

29:40.470 --> 29:42.310
We gotta do something
about the cops outside.

29:42.310 --> 29:44.440
Make 'em start
listening up.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.950
Why don't I just pop
this one--

29:46.950 --> 29:47.950
You start poppin' Rangers

29:47.950 --> 29:49.510
and this thing goes wrong,

29:49.520 --> 29:51.150
we're all gonna fry.

29:51.150 --> 29:52.380
Not just Guthrie.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.490
Shut up.

29:53.490 --> 29:54.690
I do the thinkin'
around here.

29:54.690 --> 29:55.820
Me and my sister.

29:55.820 --> 29:57.660
If I can't call
the shots, she does.

29:57.660 --> 29:59.590
You got that?

30:02.430 --> 30:03.600
He's right, sis.

30:03.600 --> 30:07.470
No sense you all frying
if this goes bust,

30:07.470 --> 30:08.800
but it ain't,

30:08.800 --> 30:11.400
'cause push comes to shove,
we can use the Ranger

30:11.410 --> 30:13.440
to make sure we're doing
the pushing and the shoving.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.770
DIXON ( over bullhorn ):
<i> Guthrie.</i>

30:14.770 --> 30:16.270
<i> Guthrie,</i>
<i> this is Dixon.</i>

30:16.280 --> 30:18.580
We're tied
into the airphone.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.050
Pick it up.
Talk to me.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.760
Lieutenant Dixon.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.230
Well, well, well.
The gang's all here.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.790
Your gang's grounded, Guthrie.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.160
<i> Not for long.</i>

30:36.160 --> 30:38.030
We're gonna be heading
into the wild blue yonder

30:38.030 --> 30:39.930
as soon as you gas up this bird.

30:39.930 --> 30:42.770
We'll talk about that after
you release the passengers...

30:42.770 --> 30:43.800
all of 'em.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.300
Half now.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.370
Half later.

30:46.370 --> 30:47.670
That's not good enough, Guthrie.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.940
I need more.

30:48.940 --> 30:50.440
Make me a better offer.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.610
Dixon.

30:51.610 --> 30:53.610
Dixon, we have
three wounded aboard.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.610
I don't like
the sound of that.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.750
What are you trying
to pull?

30:58.750 --> 31:00.050
I heard there was one.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.720
Well, you heard wrong,
and you get them first.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.560
After you gas up this bird,

31:04.560 --> 31:06.090
then you get the passengers.

31:06.090 --> 31:08.630
<i> Women, kids, geezers.</i>

31:08.630 --> 31:09.830
<i> You know the drill.</i>

31:09.830 --> 31:11.230
Then we're outta here.

31:11.230 --> 31:12.830
Take it or leave it.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.700
Guthrie, he's hurt bad.
We need a paramedic.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.670
No!

31:16.670 --> 31:17.870
Nice try, Walker.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.240
But I don't want cops
in white jackets up here.

31:20.240 --> 31:24.340
Dixon, gurneys only,
and make it fast,

31:24.350 --> 31:26.910
or you're gonna be taking out
dead instead of wounded.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.850
I want a refueling truck
out there now.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.120
I want two paramedic vans
and a hydraulic lift.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.120
Yes, sir.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.450
I want sharpshooters there,

31:36.460 --> 31:38.460
there and there.

31:38.460 --> 31:40.690
I want this bastard.
I want him bad.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.160
I want him dead.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.660
Guthrie!

31:44.600 --> 31:45.830
Three wounded?

31:45.830 --> 31:48.270
I don't know what
the hell you're up to, man.

31:48.270 --> 31:50.440
They're never gonna let us
take off out of here.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.640
Get out of my face, damn it.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.210
I told you,
I do the thinking.

31:53.210 --> 31:55.310
They're never gonna
let us take--

31:55.310 --> 31:56.410
( yells )

31:59.050 --> 32:00.880
That makes
two casualties.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.580
Guess who's gonna
be number three.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.060
Guthrie.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.100
Guthrie, the gurneys
are coming up.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.200
Okay, Dixon.
One at a time.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.300
I wanna see that fuel truck,

32:20.300 --> 32:21.600
and I want to see it now.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.470
As soon as we get
the casualties.

32:28.410 --> 32:29.910
Let's go, let's go,
Let's go, let's go.

32:29.910 --> 32:31.040
Watch yourself
in there.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.640
Everybody that's
in there is armed.

32:33.810 --> 32:36.480
You stay put,
Boy Scout.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.080
Come with me, princess.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.940
Open it
when I tell you.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.080
OFFICER:
Stay steady.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.590
They're armed,
and they're dangerous.

33:16.590 --> 33:17.860
I don't want anybody
to get hurt.

33:30.370 --> 33:34.240
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

35:22.020 --> 35:24.180
Check out those injured.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.360
Put him in.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.240
DIXON:
Get that fuel truck in here

35:44.240 --> 35:45.900
so we can get the rest
of the passengers off.

35:45.910 --> 35:46.910
( sirens wail )

35:46.910 --> 35:49.470
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

36:12.770 --> 36:15.100
Drive like I say
or die.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.770
Her brother sold you
a bill of goods, Boland.

36:48.770 --> 36:50.240
What are you
talkin' about?

36:50.240 --> 36:51.400
That line
that Guthrie said

36:51.410 --> 36:53.340
about being the only one
that will fry?

36:54.240 --> 36:55.410
Mm-mm.

36:55.410 --> 36:57.440
Accessories to murder
get the same ticket

36:57.440 --> 37:00.910
to the hot seat as the guy
that pulls the trigger.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.850
Get that buttoned up.

37:02.850 --> 37:04.950
Come on.

37:04.950 --> 37:07.020
Move it.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.650
Come on.

37:08.650 --> 37:09.650
Move it.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.860
Unless they cooperate.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.260
Cooperate?

37:14.260 --> 37:16.260
You mean,
we can cut a deal?

37:16.260 --> 37:17.760
WALKER:
You cooperate,
we'll talk.

37:17.760 --> 37:18.860
Hey.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.430
He's not in charge.

37:21.430 --> 37:23.640
No deal.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.840
Are you gonna let her
tell you what to do?

37:25.840 --> 37:26.900
Yeah, he is.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.970
So get that pilot
up there,

37:28.980 --> 37:30.340
and get this bird
in the air.

37:30.340 --> 37:31.410
BOLAND:
Shut up!

37:31.410 --> 37:32.740
Don't you be telling me
what to do.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.240
OFFICER:
They're coming out!

38:00.940 --> 38:02.940
( officers shouting )

38:05.110 --> 38:06.840
OFFICER 2:
Watch your arm!

38:06.850 --> 38:07.880
OFFICER 3:
Legs together!

38:09.050 --> 38:10.820
Walker, Walker,
where the hell are you going?

38:10.820 --> 38:12.920
Guthrie got away
in one of the ambulances.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.650
Airport road is the only
way out of here.

38:14.650 --> 38:17.220
Heads east
towards downtown.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.960
Hey, hey!
This is my car.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.460
Then hop in.

38:27.400 --> 38:28.400
( siren wails )

39:09.480 --> 39:11.040
Stand on it, man.

39:11.040 --> 39:13.040
Stand on it!

40:06.400 --> 40:08.400
( horn honking )

40:46.110 --> 40:49.110
(<i> action rock theme playing</i> )

41:09.900 --> 41:11.400
( gunshots )

41:52.810 --> 41:54.310
DIXON:
All right!
Follow him in!

41:54.310 --> 41:55.740
Get around the back, now!

41:58.110 --> 41:59.210
Move!

42:37.720 --> 42:39.220
( motorcycle revs )

42:45.120 --> 42:46.460
Guthrie!

42:47.230 --> 42:49.190
( gunshot )

42:58.100 --> 43:00.300
Dreams do
come true, huh?

43:01.810 --> 43:04.110
You wanna do it the easy way

43:04.110 --> 43:05.110
or the hard way?

43:05.810 --> 43:06.810
( grunts )

43:14.920 --> 43:17.720
Good. The hard way, huh?

43:23.660 --> 43:24.660
( yells )

43:27.600 --> 43:28.700
( screams )

43:28.700 --> 43:30.800
You just can't
get it right, can ya?

43:32.640 --> 43:34.110
Having fun yet?

43:45.090 --> 43:47.150
This is for
the Ranger's family.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.030
And this one's for me.

44:14.150 --> 44:15.650
( groaning )

44:20.290 --> 44:21.290
Guthrie's back there.

44:21.290 --> 44:22.290
Alive?
Oh, yeah.

44:23.390 --> 44:25.020
How bad is it?

44:25.020 --> 44:26.520
Flesh wound.

44:27.590 --> 44:29.630
First time?

44:29.630 --> 44:31.460
As a matter of fact,
it is.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.400
Did I ever tell you about
the first time I got shot?

44:34.400 --> 44:35.400
No, why don't
you tell me

44:35.400 --> 44:37.370
while I sit here
and bleed to death.

44:37.370 --> 44:38.800
Well, it was
about ten years ago.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.540
I was chasing this guy
through a cemetery...

44:43.380 --> 44:44.910
C.D., let's go.

44:44.910 --> 44:46.240
I'm coming just

44:46.250 --> 44:47.410
as fast as I can.

44:47.410 --> 44:49.280
I can't go any faster
than I'm going.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.920
Are you sure you can handle this
place while I'm gone?

44:51.920 --> 44:53.950
Like I told you,
you old coot,

44:53.950 --> 44:55.090
if you can run it,
I can run it.

44:55.090 --> 44:56.550
Haven't we heard
this before?

44:56.560 --> 44:58.820
They're worse
than being married.

44:58.830 --> 45:01.730
Look, just in case you run out
of Goobers and beef jerky,

45:01.730 --> 45:04.360
they're in the preserve jars
up in under the bar.

45:04.360 --> 45:06.160
Up in under
the bar, Mabel.

45:06.170 --> 45:08.130
Isn't this the tenth time
he's told you that?

45:08.130 --> 45:09.730
Try a hundred.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.170
All right. Let's get
the hell outta here.

45:12.170 --> 45:13.670
Oh, my God,
there she is.

45:13.670 --> 45:14.840
Let's head out
the back door!

45:14.840 --> 45:18.880
(<i> mellow theme playing</i> )
