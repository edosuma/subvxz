Oh, I got to grab this.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.071
Call me later
and tell me about

09:32.113 --> 09:33.781
the fantastic day
you're having.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.200
Fine. I will
go have fun.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.327
That's all I ask. Ha ha.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.205
Dr. Moore, I am so glad you
returned my call so quickly.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.750
Yes. That's wonderful.
Every little bit helps.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.336
I'll be in touch
with the details.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.256
Look who decided to walk
through my door--
Mr. Ralph Wells.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.425
What brings you
back to campus?

09:52.466 --> 09:54.552
I'm doing an article on
the Free Black Joy Day

09:54.594 --> 09:56.345
and you.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.765
Yes to what we're doing here.
You can save the ink on me.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.851
I beg to differ.
You went to the board

10:01.892 --> 10:04.228
and asked for the funds
for mental health
professionals,

10:04.270 --> 10:06.522
gave student organizations
a financial boost so
they could participate--

10:06.564 --> 10:07.940
And how do you know
all of that?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.775
I'm a journalist,
remember?

10:09.817 --> 10:12.445
So how about a tour
of Black Joy Day
and an interview?

10:12.486 --> 10:14.739
As tempting
as that sounds,

10:14.780 --> 10:17.700
I'm going to be stuck
to this desk
deep into the night.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.244
So no Free Day for you.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.538
Interesting.
Uh, if you change
your mind...

10:22.580 --> 10:24.332
I know how to reach you.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.588
Mama Mays, uh,
I thought you left.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.633
Well, I was about to,
but then I told
myself, "Mama Mays,

10:33.674 --> 10:35.509
you haven't questioned
the boyfriend," so...

10:35.551 --> 10:37.011
I waited for you.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.013
OK. Um...

10:40.431 --> 10:41.932
So did you have a good
visit with Thea?

10:41.974 --> 10:44.060
It was fine.

10:44.101 --> 10:47.313
She spent the whole day
telling me how great
everything is.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.732
Only thing missing
was a PowerPoint

10:49.774 --> 10:52.443
and a little
laser pointer.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.695
Thea really is OK.
For real.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.698
She's recovering from
an injury that may not
let her play tennis,

10:57.740 --> 11:00.117
and you all just had
a bomb threat.
She's not OK.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.496
So either you are gonna
tell me what's what,

11:03.537 --> 11:07.375
or you gonna
tell me what's what.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.002
She's been pushing
herself really hard.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.546
Look, her recovery is
back on track now,

11:12.588 --> 11:15.716
but she did have a setback
a few weeks ago, and...

11:15.758 --> 11:18.552
she ain't really been
sleeping.

11:18.594 --> 11:22.473
Listen, do you think
that she needs to
stop playing tennis,

11:22.515 --> 11:24.475
you know, and just focus
on her recovery?

11:24.517 --> 11:25.976
Damon: Look,
I don't think that--

11:26.018 --> 11:27.645
Mom, what are you
still doing here?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.648
Pamela: I decided to stay
a little longer.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.982
[Clears throat]

11:32.024 --> 11:34.110
I want to spend
some time with you,

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
find out what this
Black Joy Day is all about.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.955
Hey. It's me again,
just calling

11:45.996 --> 11:47.998
to check in on you.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.084
Just call me back, OK?

11:52.545 --> 11:55.756
Simone. Hey.
Have you seen Cam?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.967
I thought you two
were supposed to be
hanging out today.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.261
Now, you know nothing
about that sentence
makes sense.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.722
Is he OK? What's going on?

12:02.763 --> 12:04.724
I don't know. He's in
his "I'm not talking
to anybody" bag.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.351
I mean, if you want,
I can stop by the dorm,
check in on him.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.854
Mm-mm, no. I see
what you're doing.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.647
You've avoiding having fun,

12:11.689 --> 12:13.190
even though your auntie
specifically told you to.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.817
I'm sorry.
How do you know that?

12:14.859 --> 12:17.486
She texted the fam,
asked us to point you

12:17.528 --> 12:19.572
in the direction of fun
if you lost your way.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.450
-Well, I know how to have fun.
-Then why aren't you doing it?

12:22.491 --> 12:23.951
Why aren't you
in dance class?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.078
'Cause Dr. Pace
can kiss my ass.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.872
I mean, talk about
tone-deaf.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.790
If she was gonna have
us dance today,

12:29.832 --> 12:32.460
the least she could've
done was have us perform
for Bringston,

12:32.501 --> 12:35.212
use our art to bring back
some of the life
the bomb threat took.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.007
Pace: Ms. McCalla,
your break is over.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.258
Dr. Pace, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.885
Let's get back to work.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.388
Good luck, girl.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.102
[Music playing]

12:53.439 --> 12:54.815
Ralph, it's good
to see you, man.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.484
I've been meaning
to call you.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.152
I owe you an apology
for how I--

12:58.194 --> 12:59.987
Hey, you--you weren't
in a good place, man.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.948
Now it seems like
you are, so no harm,
no foul, yeah? OK.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.533
You got it.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.285
So what is good here?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.787
Are you kidding me?
Everything!

13:07.828 --> 13:08.871
OK.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.331
Heh heh. What you want?

13:10.372 --> 13:12.082
I have a rib plate
for Cam Watkins.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.293
Ralph: Yeah. I'll get back
to you on that, yeah?

13:14.335 --> 13:15.294
OK.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.837
Uh, Mr. Watkins...

13:16.879 --> 13:18.714
I'm Ralph Wells with
the "Atlantic Daily News."

13:18.756 --> 13:20.424
I'm doing a story
on the bomb threat.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.176
I ain't got
nothing to say.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.929
Listen, I understand that
it's difficult to talk about,

13:24.970 --> 13:27.014
but you took the call.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.099
Hey, bruh, you really
need to leave me
alone, all right?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.685
Right, but your experience
could really help--

13:31.727 --> 13:33.521
Hey. What are you, deaf?
I said I ain't got nothing
to say, all right?

13:33.562 --> 13:37.024
Whoa, whoa. Easy, son.
It's all right.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.491
Bam! Boom!

13:45.533 --> 13:47.034
Thea: Now she's living
her best life

13:47.076 --> 13:48.828
as a 42-year-old
college student.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.704
What did you say?

13:50.746 --> 13:55.668
[Chuckles]
Nothing--heh--bad.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.380
What did you say?

14:01.423 --> 14:03.592
OK. So that's
how it's gonna be, babe.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.553
That's how it's
gonna be.

14:05.594 --> 14:06.720
That's how it's
gonna be? That's
how it's gonna be?

14:06.762 --> 14:08.722
[Laughter]

14:08.764 --> 14:11.892
All right. Uh...ha ha!

14:11.934 --> 14:14.061
I told her that your
recovery's going well now,

14:14.103 --> 14:18.482
but...I still think that
you push yourself too hard.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.609
What did my mom have
to say about me

14:20.651 --> 14:23.529
allegedly pushing
myself too hard?

14:25.614 --> 14:30.536
Uh, she asked me if
I thought you should
quit tennis.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.663
All right,
sweetie. Step.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.373
Where we
going next?

14:34.415 --> 14:37.126
I'm going to change
out of these wet clothes,

14:37.167 --> 14:40.713
and I'll let you two talk since
you love doing it so much.

14:47.011 --> 14:50.264
OK. This is the last place
I thought I'd see you.

14:50.306 --> 14:54.435
This painting. "Beautiful"
doesn't quite capture it.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.395
Lando: Yeah. I've seen
this a billion times.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.606
I still can't find
the words.

14:58.647 --> 15:00.608
Boy, you just got
to campus.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.151
How have you seen this
a billion times?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.028
Because I was there
when it was being painted.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.905
My mom's the artist.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.281
Wow.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.534
She's got a great eye.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.328
Yeah, she does.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.498
She used to say, "Baby,
out of all my art,

15:16.540 --> 15:18.417
you are my best creation."

15:18.459 --> 15:20.044
[Both chuckle]

15:20.085 --> 15:21.629
Corny, right?

15:22.922 --> 15:26.717
Actually, as a mom,
I think it's sweet.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.012
So I've been watching you
since you rolled up in here.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.472
OK, 'cause that's
not weird.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.349
You grabbed a library map
on your way in.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.309
You ain't never
been in here?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.685
Everything I need
for classes is

15:36.727 --> 15:38.520
in the West library.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.357
But it's part of the tour
during freshman orientation.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.777
I never actually went on
the orientation tour.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.029
I was already too busy
with tennis.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.282
Wait. So no B.U. freshman
rite of passage?

15:50.324 --> 15:52.034
I'm sorry. No "B.U.
rite of" what, now?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.452
Ha ha!

15:53.494 --> 15:55.120
All right. Cool.
It's about to go down.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.747
OK. I'm gonna need you
to come with me.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.290
Uh-uh. Where are we going?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.042
Just trust me. Come on.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.337
[Sighs]

16:04.046 --> 16:08.050
Pace: I have been called
many things in my career...

16:08.092 --> 16:12.930
but I have to say,
"tone-deaf" is not one of them.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.349
Someone brought
to my attention that

16:15.391 --> 16:18.185
having you dance today
just for the sake of training

16:18.227 --> 16:20.270
is not meeting the moment.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.106
They're right.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.525
We have an obligation
and responsibility

16:24.566 --> 16:28.404
to use our art to uplift
the rest of our community.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.989
So you will perform today...

16:30.030 --> 16:31.865
in the quad.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.576
Be back here in two hours
ready to learn new choreography

16:34.618 --> 16:37.079
that will inspire your
community.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.372
You're dismissed.

16:38.414 --> 16:41.583
Dr. Pace, thank you so much.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.962
If you want the class
to perform for the other
students, that's fine,

16:45.004 --> 16:47.715
but you're going
to choreograph
the new routine.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.508
In two hours? I don't--

16:49.550 --> 16:52.302
Is that a problem?

16:52.344 --> 16:54.304
No, not at all.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.682
Thank you
for the opportunity.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.566
Oh, hey, Damon,
what's up, man?

17:05.607 --> 17:07.609
Ha ha.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.446
Pamela: You haven't
said anything about
the bomb threat.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.906
It might help to
talk about it.
If not to me, then, um...

17:12.948 --> 17:15.743
I--I've already
talked to people.

17:15.784 --> 17:17.703
I don't need anything
affecting my mental game.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.913
I have to stay sharp
on the court.

17:19.955 --> 17:24.543
OK, listen, you have to make
time for friends, too.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.588
And I'm sure Damon would
love to see you more.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.089
Don't bring Damon
into this,

17:29.131 --> 17:31.341
no more than you
already have.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.635
Damon: Hey, hey, hey. How
about I win us a stuffed
animal? I'm pretty sure--

17:33.677 --> 17:35.679
And for the record,
I have friends.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.182
Damon: Uh, yeah. You don't
have to worry about her.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.851
She has a lot of people here
that really care about her.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.186
[Scoffs]

17:42.227 --> 17:43.937
I thought you'd
be thrilled

17:43.979 --> 17:46.356
that I'm not
completely
socially awkward.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.692
I am, all right?
It's just...

17:48.734 --> 17:51.945
Look, I'm glad you're
finally letting people in.

17:51.987 --> 17:53.697
I just wish I were
one of them.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.491
OK, well, Mom,
my friends

17:55.532 --> 17:57.951
actually support
my tennis dream.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.496
Tee-Tee, I do support you.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.040
By asking my boyfriend
if I should quit
because of my injury?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.250
Damon: Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
Your mom is just concerned.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.377
Your parents basically paid
for the tennis courts.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.213
That's support, right?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.422
Listen, I--
[Exhales noisily]

18:10.464 --> 18:11.715
Mom--

18:11.757 --> 18:13.675
So now you're
telling people that

18:13.717 --> 18:17.679
your dad and I are donors
to the tennis program?

18:17.721 --> 18:19.264
Thea: I can explain.
Damon: Wait. So are you saying--

18:19.306 --> 18:20.557
Pamela:
I don't want to hear it.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.142
I knew you
were ashamed of us,

18:22.184 --> 18:26.647
but I had no idea how much
until right now.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.149
I...there was...

18:31.068 --> 18:33.195
Babe, I don't
understand what--

18:33.237 --> 18:34.530
[Growls]

18:36.240 --> 18:37.658
Thea.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.210
Now, I know you
not hiding.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.379
Shouldn't you be outside
Black Joy-ing it up?

18:50.420 --> 18:52.840
Bathroom break.
What's your excuse?

18:52.881 --> 18:55.551
Damn. A brother can't get
some KEK work done in peace?

18:55.592 --> 18:58.387
Not on Black Joy Day
he can't.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.598
Oh, my God. You are
hiding, aren't you?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.184
What? No.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.310
Maybe.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.730
Spill.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.732

30:06.221 --> 30:08.181
you really rose
to the occasion.

30:08.223 --> 30:11.434
That was beautiful,
and the campus
clearly needed it.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.978
Dr. Pace, I can't even--

30:14.020 --> 30:17.398
But if you ever
challenge me or question
my decisions again,

30:17.440 --> 30:19.818
you will be cut
from this class.

30:22.904 --> 30:27.909
OK, I may or may not
have selectively
overheard that.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.577
Keisha, you OK?

30:29.619 --> 30:33.748
Yes. You know, I don't
really know, actually.

30:33.790 --> 30:37.293
I can't think
about her right now.
I need to go find Cam.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.837
I love you.

30:38.878 --> 30:39.963
I love you, too.

30:42.173 --> 30:46.302
OK. You can do this.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.513
Relax.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.306
Relate.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.058
Release.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.228
Relax.

30:59.065 --> 31:02.026
Simone, real talk,

31:02.068 --> 31:04.028
I'm surprised
to see you back.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.114
I'm sorry
about earlier.

31:06.155 --> 31:09.200
I was just rude
and in denial,

31:09.242 --> 31:11.452
if I'm being honest.

31:11.494 --> 31:15.456
So my prescription
for today is relaxation.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.625
A mani and pedi sounds
great right about now,

31:17.667 --> 31:19.252
if that's OK.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.963
Of course. Look,
no worries about earlier.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.172
I get it.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.841
And since we're
being honest,

31:24.883 --> 31:26.384
I was a wreck
after the threat.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.635
How did you make it
through?

31:27.677 --> 31:29.637
My PKZ sisters.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.181
When I needed to talk,
they listened.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.350
When I needed to cry,
they had tissues.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.227
When I needed someone
to hold my hair back

31:36.269 --> 31:38.813
because I was
physically sick, they did.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.190
This sisterhood between
us Black women,

31:41.232 --> 31:44.527
that's the best part,
rebalanced me.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.738
So come on.
[Chuckles]

31:49.782 --> 31:52.452
I thought
you left.

31:52.493 --> 31:57.916
I did, but Damon made
a very convincing argument.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.293
You know, if this baseball
thing doesn't pan out,

32:00.335 --> 32:02.086
he should go into law.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.717
I'm sorry
about the lie.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.636
Um...

32:09.677 --> 32:13.014
at the time I was
a 15 year old

32:13.056 --> 32:14.641
playing on
the junior circuit

32:14.682 --> 32:17.936
with girls whose parents
owned jets and...

32:17.977 --> 32:21.481
And you just wanted
to fit in.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.068
I told one person

32:25.109 --> 32:28.571
that my parents donated
the courts at Bringston,

32:28.613 --> 32:33.618
and before I knew it,
the lie followed me here.

32:33.660 --> 32:36.621
And I know it's stupid,

32:36.663 --> 32:38.414
but I just...

32:38.456 --> 32:40.249
felt so alone.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.002
Baby, listen,
you are not alone,
all right?

32:43.044 --> 32:45.004
Why didn't you call me?

32:45.046 --> 32:47.423
Because, Mom, you never
wanted tennis for me.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.509
Why do you think I went
to live with Granny Mays?

32:49.550 --> 32:51.552
Because she shared
my love for tennis.

32:51.594 --> 32:53.846
She understood,
she wanted it for me

32:53.888 --> 32:55.473
as badly as I did.

32:55.515 --> 32:57.642
Baby, I wanted tennis
for you, too.

32:57.684 --> 33:01.854
It was your
single-minded focus
on it that worried us.

33:01.896 --> 33:05.358
I wanted you to have
normal childhood
experiences

33:05.400 --> 33:11.614
or have sleep-overs
and prom and graduation
and boyfriends.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.534
I wanted you happy.

33:14.575 --> 33:18.496
During the bomb threat,
I thought about you and dad

33:18.538 --> 33:23.126
and how I sacrificed
a lot of time with you

33:23.167 --> 33:25.294
for tennis

33:25.336 --> 33:28.131
and that if my injury
or anything else

33:28.172 --> 33:30.466
stopped me from getting
back on those courts,

33:30.508 --> 33:33.094
that sacrifice would
have been for nothing.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.722
OK, look, listen to me.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.559
We will always be there.

33:42.228 --> 33:45.189
And you are gonna achieve
your tennis dream.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.817
And I have to come up
with a new word
to describe

33:47.859 --> 33:50.445
just how amazing you are.

33:50.486 --> 33:52.030
I love you so much.

34:05.251 --> 34:08.379
You found balance.
[Chuckles]

34:08.421 --> 34:10.965
And, of course,
you know, you did it
on your own time,

34:11.007 --> 34:13.509
but Damon
is proof of that.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.553
I think I screwed
that up.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.472
Damon told me that
he loved me,

34:17.513 --> 34:19.974
and I said it back,
and I meant it.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.226

of been freaking out.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.394
Why?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.313
My whole life, I thought

34:25.354 --> 34:27.940
the people I love would
eventually give up on me...

34:29.692 --> 34:32.195
but I know now I was wrong.

34:32.236 --> 34:37.283
Well, listen, if you
really do love him,

34:37.325 --> 34:40.286
well, you're gonna have
to make this right.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.579

Damon, what's going on?

34:55.426 --> 34:57.303
Uh, no clue. I just got
a text from Cam

34:57.345 --> 34:59.514
saying to come to the room
and wait in the hallway.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.265
Same here.
It's weird, right?

35:01.307 --> 35:03.976
Is it OK if I start
freaking out a little bit?

35:04.018 --> 35:07.146
Damon: Coach,
what are you doing here?

35:07.188 --> 35:09.107

use his friends right now.

see that we shouldn't
go through this alone.
