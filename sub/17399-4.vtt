00:15.940 --> 00:17.490
James wears a hat.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.110
And Richard is behind a low wall

00:27.170 --> 00:30.860
Thank you. Hello and thank
you so much, everybody.

00:30.895 --> 00:33.575
Thank you. Thank you and welcome.

00:33.610 --> 00:39.610
Now, last week you may remember we asked
James May to test an exciting, fast Vauxhall

00:39.645 --> 00:42.875
and he ended up reviewing a slow, small Fiat.

00:42.910 --> 00:48.450
Well, this week, we asked him to go to Florida
and try out a new type of electric car.

00:48.485 --> 00:52.820
We said to him, "James, this time,
can you try to stay on topic?"

01:02.940 --> 01:05.865
Here it is - it's called the Fisker Karma,

01:05.900 --> 01:10.130
and let's not be having any debate,
it looks fantastic.

01:15.430 --> 01:16.835
But maybe that's not surprising,

01:16.870 --> 01:22.900
because the company that makes it was set up
not by an engineer, as usual, but by a designer.

01:22.935 --> 01:29.170
He was responsible for the Aston Martin
V8 Vantage and the BMW Z8 roadster,

01:29.205 --> 01:32.305
so obviously he knows his way around a pencil.

01:32.340 --> 01:38.210
But it's not the looks we're interested in.
It's what goes on underneath that bodywork.

01:43.430 --> 01:48.160
As with most electric cars,
underneath here is a great big slab of batteries,

01:48.195 --> 01:51.060
and you can plug those into a socket
at your house or your office

01:51.095 --> 01:55.090
and recharge them and then you have
a range of 50 miles -

01:55.125 --> 01:57.477
which doesn't sound very good, does it?

01:57.512 --> 01:59.795
But then, if I just touch this lever here,

01:59.830 --> 02:03.705
I engage a two-litre petrol engine,
which is under the bonnet.

02:03.740 --> 02:08.669
But unlike, say, a Toyota Prius,
the engine isn't connected to the wheels.

02:08.705 --> 02:12.605
Instead, it drives an electricity generator.

02:12.640 --> 02:17.040
At this point, the display is telling me
I only have nine miles of range left,

02:17.075 --> 02:19.645
and normally I'd be going,
"Oh, God, will I make it?"

02:19.680 --> 02:24.480
But no, because I know, with the touch of that
paddle, or even leaving it to its own devices,

02:24.515 --> 02:27.370
the petrol engine will make more electric.

02:29.430 --> 02:35.610
So, it's driven by electric motors,
but it has its own on-board power station.

02:35.645 --> 02:40.050
You might be thinking you've sort of heard
something like that before.

02:40.085 --> 02:42.080
Well, you have.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.325
Yes, I'm talking about
the Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust,

02:47.360 --> 02:52.130
which, I might point out, was also
fitted with its own electricity generator -

02:52.165 --> 02:54.680
and that was two years ago.

02:56.570 --> 02:58.895
There is no polite way of putting this.

02:58.930 --> 03:02.780
Fisker have, very blatantly, brazenly, I'd say -

03:02.815 --> 03:06.630
copied my idea for a long range electric car.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.060
Except they didn't have theirs styled by Jeremy,

03:09.095 --> 03:11.345
but the technology is exactly the same.

03:11.380 --> 03:15.380
As my lawyers will be
making very clear quite soon.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.250
Admittedly, the Fisker is much better built
than the Eagle i-Thrust

03:20.285 --> 03:24.600
and it's probably the most
politically correct car on earth.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.215
It has solar panels on the roof,
because in the car,

03:28.250 --> 03:32.330
all this stuff here runs off electricity
and that would drain the battery,

03:32.365 --> 03:35.865
but that can produce a sort of
low-voltage circuit, if you like,

03:35.900 --> 03:41.920
that can drive the radio and the sat-nav,
interior lights and your iPod,

03:41.955 --> 03:46.180
and even the little system
that recognises this key -

03:53.330 --> 03:56.430
This version I have here is called the Eco-Chic -

03:56.465 --> 03:58.335
they have actually called it that,

03:58.370 --> 04:02.650
because it embraces a lot of very right-on
and ethically-sound materials.

04:02.685 --> 04:05.635
For example, the glitter in the metallic paint

04:05.670 --> 04:09.735
is made with ground-up minute particles
of recycled glass

04:09.770 --> 04:14.015
and on the inside, we find a piece of wood trim
that is only taken

04:14.050 --> 04:18.640
from trees that have been burnt down
in forest fires or felled by storms

04:18.675 --> 04:21.640
and it's not varnished, because
there is no varnish in nature.

04:21.675 --> 04:25.307
These glass inserts have
in them a fossilised leaf -

04:25.342 --> 04:28.796
a leaf that has fallen of
its own accord, not plucked.

04:28.831 --> 04:32.215
And all of the interior fabrics
are very, very funky

04:32.250 --> 04:36.900
and most importantly,
there are no animal products in there at all.

04:37.230 --> 04:40.245
The only animal product in this car is me,

04:40.280 --> 04:44.240
all of which ought to keep this chap here
very happy indeed,

04:44.275 --> 04:47.430
and yet I'm told if I go any closer than this,

04:47.465 --> 04:49.405
he'll still probably have my leg off...

04:49.440 --> 04:53.290
Which just goes to prove
that animals are ungrateful.

04:56.110 --> 04:58.885
Basically, if the Fisker was any more green,

04:58.920 --> 05:02.100
it would be chaining itself to
a Japanese whaling ship.

05:02.870 --> 05:07.765
But I like being in it.
It's just a very nice place to be, the Fisker -

05:07.800 --> 05:12.970
it makes you realise that just putting leather
on everything is a terrible old cliche

05:13.005 --> 05:15.370
it's what the Romans would have done.

05:16.110 --> 05:18.770
And on top of that, I like driving it.

05:18.805 --> 05:20.605
It's a nice-handling car, this.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.405
It's not a Lotus, it's not a Ferrari 458,

05:23.440 --> 05:29.110
it's a GT car. It's a GT car for long journeys,
but that's nice to drive.

05:29.145 --> 05:33.080
And even though its arsenal of batteries mean
it weighs 2.5 tonnes,

05:33.115 --> 05:35.010
it does shift along

05:37.170 --> 05:41.590
The car will do 0-60 in just
a tad over six seconds.

05:41.625 --> 05:45.975
It doesn't have a very high
top speed - only 125mph -

05:46.010 --> 05:50.120
but the point is, electric motors produce
excellent torque -

05:50.155 --> 05:52.880
1,000 pound-feet, in fact,
which is more than a Veyron.

05:54.580 --> 06:00.070
I love electric-powered cars,
just the sort of slight whining spaceship noise.

06:04.330 --> 06:08.200
Now, the price. All electric cars are expensive,

06:08.235 --> 06:12.035
and the Fisker - at 86,000- is no exception.

06:12.070 --> 06:15.870
This means it'll appeal only to
the well-heeled petrolhead,

06:15.905 --> 06:19.085
so since I was in Florida, I went to see one.

06:19.120 --> 06:23.380
Hello there, James, me bonny lad.
What brings you to this neck of the woods?

06:23.415 --> 06:27.005
Yes, it's AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.010
It's the first car I think I've ever seen
that actually looks like

06:30.045 --> 06:32.430
the drawings that you see before they come.

06:33.620 --> 06:34.465
Yeah, it's good-looking, isn't it?

06:34.500 --> 06:37.960
It really is a cracking-looking jam-jar,
look at the state of that!

06:37.995 --> 06:39.425
Do want to try it? Absolutely!

06:39.460 --> 06:41.850
Do you want to try mine? Yeah! All right, then.

06:41.885 --> 06:43.580
Well... Mine's different.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.510
Fantastic!

06:53.640 --> 06:59.170
This is a 1928 Le Mans-bodied 4.5-litre Bentley.

06:59.205 --> 07:01.495
Brian really does use this every day -

07:01.530 --> 07:05.320
he uses it to go down
the shop for a pint of milk.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.360
Go on, me son! Born to do it!

07:17.930 --> 07:22.690
Despite the mangled gear changes,
I was very much enjoying living in the past.

07:22.725 --> 07:25.380
I can feel a moustache growing!

07:27.640 --> 07:30.855
God, the smell is tremendous. Hot castor oil.

07:30.890 --> 07:34.820
Well-known laxative, I'll have diarrhoea
by the time we get there.

07:34.855 --> 07:38.750
Brian, however, wasn't coping so well with
living in the future.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.885
Oh, Christ, now what happens?

07:42.920 --> 07:45.905
I'm getting near the bottom of me battery level,
oh my word.

07:45.940 --> 07:55.250
Right, now... And... That means
I have to do something, and I'm... Bugger.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.055
What the heck is that?

07:59.090 --> 08:02.410
I'm trying to follow James's instructions,
which were as clear as mud.

08:02.445 --> 08:05.015
There he goes, flying by with his thumb up!

08:05.050 --> 08:08.480
He's having a whale of a time and
I'm trying to figure out this computer thing.

08:11.230 --> 08:14.770
Soon, the famous Geordie hat model
wanted his Bentley back,

08:26.040 --> 08:28.615
I've put it in sport mode -
that means as I pull away,

08:28.650 --> 08:32.789
every bit of electricity available
to this car goes to maximum acceleration -

08:32.825 --> 08:35.900
1,000-pound-feet of torque in the back wheels.

08:42.330 --> 08:43.950
Yellow, yellow, yellow... Green!

08:46.300 --> 08:47.780
Johnson makes a good start!

08:48.600 --> 08:49.800
This could take it!

08:53.880 --> 08:55.370
Come on, you little bugger!

08:56.650 --> 09:00.410
I'm afraid Thunder Guts is a bit of a
dwindling speck, ladies and gentlemen.

09:11.270 --> 09:15.750
Did you enjoy that, me son?
I did, although to be honest, I felt a bit cowardly.

09:15.785 --> 09:19.675
Not as much as I enjoyed
myself in this, I'll bet you.

09:19.710 --> 09:22.890
Tell you what, your car looks heroic
in my rear-view mirror.

09:22.925 --> 09:25.250
But also, I'm afraid, quite small. Yes!

09:27.270 --> 09:30.095
But it's starting to rain. It is, isn't it?

09:30.130 --> 09:34.720
And I don't have a hood. Well, I do,
but it takes 45 minutes to erect.

09:34.755 --> 09:36.730
See you back down the other end.
See you back down the other end.

09:36.765 --> 09:40.960
Thanks guys, for that.
Got to start the BLEEP now.

09:45.340 --> 09:51.505
May! What? What's wrong with you?
You've done it again!

09:51.540 --> 09:55.990
You're supposed to be driving a Fisker,
then you're in a Bentley with a rock star!

09:56.025 --> 09:58.725
Next week, James is reviewing a Saab, OK,

09:58.760 --> 10:03.200
and halfway through, he'll break off
for a spot of scuba diving with Fergal Sharkey.

10:04.250 --> 10:09.550
Can I just... The Fister, right.
It's Fisker - it's a K. It's a K.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.250
I THOUGHT that was a stupid name!
Let's just move on!

10:14.285 --> 10:16.365
Fisker. Can I just clear it up?

10:16.400 --> 10:20.535
You have the traditional all-electric car,
like a Nissan Leaf and a G-Wiz,

10:20.570 --> 10:24.670
now that's just batteries and you have
to charge them up at night, yeah? Yes.

10:24.705 --> 10:27.775
Then you have stupid hybrids,
like the Toyota Prius,

10:27.810 --> 10:32.780
which are normal cars that have electric
motors for a bit of extra power, yeah? Yes.

10:32.815 --> 10:35.235
So the Fisker is... What?

10:35.270 --> 10:38.135
It's actually a petrol-engine car,
but in a normal car,

10:38.170 --> 10:41.000
you get the power from
the engine to the back wheels

10:41.035 --> 10:43.005
through a gearbox and a shaft and so on,

10:43.040 --> 10:46.020
on this one you use the generator
and the electric motors.

10:46.055 --> 10:47.005
I'm lost.

10:47.040 --> 10:51.030
It's a more efficient way of
tapping the energy in the fuel.

10:51.065 --> 10:54.510
That's why it accelerates like a 400hp GT car,

10:54.545 --> 10:56.080
but it only uses as much fuel as a...

10:56.115 --> 10:58.005
I don't understand how it works.

10:58.040 --> 11:01.230
I can't dumb it down to your level,
cos I'm scared of heights.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.760
Listen. It's energy,
you use it to drive the wheels.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.685
You get more of it by using that system.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.490
People get confused.
They talk about electric energy..

11:10.525 --> 11:13.660
Just tell him it's magic. It's magic.

11:13.695 --> 11:15.310
It's magic electric pixies.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.465
That's all you needed to say.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.255
That's not how it actually works.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.890
I'm not bothered, actually. I am not interested.

11:21.925 --> 11:22.865
Let's just do the news.

11:22.900 --> 11:28.035
There are proposals
in the corridors of power that

11:28.070 --> 11:33.150
anyone who passes their driving test must be
accompanied for the first few years on the road

11:33.185 --> 11:37.075
by an experienced, sober person who is over 25.

11:37.110 --> 11:40.015
You can kind of see why
they think it is a good idea.

11:40.050 --> 11:48.370
a stupid idea, the stupidest.
I have spent 17 years ferrying my daughter about.

11:48.405 --> 11:50.745
Last month she passed her driving test,

11:50.780 --> 11:55.250
which means it is her turn to ferry me about,
specifically to the pub.

11:56.790 --> 12:01.980
What is the point if she gets to the pub
and can't run me home if I have had a drink?

12:03.760 --> 12:08.340
It is more complicated than that.
She could not drive to the pub on her own.

12:09.590 --> 12:12.680
So she would have to get an older boy friend.

12:12.715 --> 12:15.780
Hello, Dad, have you met Keith, he's 53!

12:17.460 --> 12:19.230
Why are you looking so excited?

12:22.040 --> 12:27.380
He has brought his teenager with him.
Are you her experienced driver?

12:27.415 --> 12:32.720
This is embarrassing for you.
Think of him as an experienced driver.

12:33.820 --> 12:37.145
government ought to recognise that
without the young people

12:37.180 --> 12:40.990
who tear around in cars we would not
have won the Battle of Britain.

12:41.025 --> 12:43.265
That is a fact. That is a fact.

12:43.300 --> 12:47.065
Teenagers, they sleep and tear about,
that is what they do.

12:47.100 --> 12:52.690
And they have more sex than us.
They don't get fat or have hangovers.

12:53.550 --> 12:57.730
Basically everybody else, the rest of us
are just old and bitter.

12:57.765 --> 13:01.910
Young is better. Young is better and
the government should not say

13:01.945 --> 13:05.045
children should have older people,

13:05.080 --> 13:08.960
they should just say to my daughter,
go to the pub and pick up your dad.

13:10.060 --> 13:14.280
Cadillac has made a concept car,
and here it is, it's called the CL.

13:16.010 --> 13:18.385
It looks astonishing. It's got a twin-turbo V6,

13:18.420 --> 13:20.725
and they say it is going back to their roots.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.480
What, so it will rock for 5 hours
after you get out of it?

13:24.810 --> 13:27.430
Does it have a 400-year-old
woman from Florida in it?

13:28.540 --> 13:31.515
It is about grandeur, splendour, scale.

13:31.550 --> 13:37.690
It is 19 feet long, enormous.
It is only 50 inches high, long, low and mean.

13:37.725 --> 13:39.460
They have built a plinth.

13:41.030 --> 13:44.220
Yes, but it comes with a cigar humidor.

13:44.255 --> 13:45.365
What, in America?

13:45.400 --> 13:49.490
It is like saying there is a new car
for Saudi Arabia with the mini bar.

13:51.110 --> 13:53.990
One for Israel, the bonnet is made of bacon.

13:54.025 --> 13:55.772
Don't smoke cigars in America.

13:55.807 --> 13:57.485
It is a magnificent looking thing.

13:57.520 --> 14:03.930
Now, a couple of years ago, Ferrari brought out
a car called the 599XX.

14:03.965 --> 14:07.150
It's slightly unusual, this, because
it cost you a million quid,

14:07.185 --> 14:09.665
but you couldn't take it home with you -
Ferrari kept it.

14:09.700 --> 14:14.480
Nor could you drive it on the road,
even if you wanted to, cos it's not road legal

14:14.515 --> 14:16.975
AND you couldn't sell it
without Ferrari's permission.

14:17.010 --> 14:22.010
The only thing you could do was ring Ferrari and
say "could you take it to such-and-such a track",

14:22.045 --> 14:24.977
have a couple of laps on it then
they'd take it away again.

14:25.012 --> 14:28.531
Yeah, did anyone actually fall for this?
Yeah, 30 people.

14:28.566 --> 14:32.050
30 people went, "that's a good deal.
I'll have one of those."

14:32.085 --> 14:35.105
And now, Ferrari are saying to these 30 people,

14:35.140 --> 14:42.240
"if you give us another 200,000, we'll fit the
car you don't actually have with a rear spoiler."

14:44.670 --> 14:47.550
200,000 pounds?
200,000 pounds for that rear spoiler.

14:47.585 --> 14:49.630
What's it made from? Spoiler material.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.765
It's one of those special, well -
you won't know -

14:53.800 --> 14:55.960
it's a DRS spoiler, like you get in Formula 1.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.610
I know that, they sell sofas.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.080
It opens and closes, depending on whether
you're going round a corner or down a straight.

15:03.115 --> 15:05.435
Who are these 30 people that bought those things?

15:05.470 --> 15:09.350
I want their e-mail addresses,
because I'd like to sell them a clock.

15:10.260 --> 15:14.660
What clock? It's really big,
it's like, on a tower, in London,

15:14.695 --> 15:16.795
next to the Houses of Parliament,
and I can sell it...

15:16.830 --> 15:20.390
Can they take it home? No, they couldn't
take it home, but it'll be their clock.

15:20.425 --> 15:21.720
Good marketing.

15:22.590 --> 15:25.575
Oh, no. Here we go. Ready? Standby, everybody.

15:25.610 --> 15:29.270
Exciting day today, because this morning
I had my first drive in the new 911.

15:29.305 --> 15:31.095
And it's a very good thing.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.550
It's not new, Richard. It isn't new.

15:33.585 --> 15:34.745
It is new! It isn't.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.045
It is! That's the new 911.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.340
Okay, right, we've got a photograph here
of the one before. 

15:41.640 --> 15:45.380
And let's have a look at the one before that.

15:45.415 --> 15:47.610
And the one before that.

15:48.880 --> 15:52.535
That one is blue,
but they are all exactly the same.

15:52.570 --> 15:55.740
They look similar, if you can get
your head around that concept.

15:55.775 --> 15:58.840
It is an entirely new 911,
and it is a very good car.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.915
I drove it, it had a very good engine.

16:01.950 --> 16:04.205
It sounds brilliant. The steering was rubbish.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.425
It's not rubbish! What have they done to it?

16:06.460 --> 16:08.595
It is different,
it's electric for the first time.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.730
So they put electric power steering on
and ruined it.

16:10.765 --> 16:14.150
They have ruined it. It's less 911.

16:14.185 --> 16:14.945
There you go.

16:14.980 --> 16:20.180
Would you agree the steering is rubbish?
It is awful but I agree with you.

16:21.280 --> 16:26.470
It is brilliant. And the steering is not appalling
but it does not feel like one any more.

16:26.505 --> 16:32.885
If you take away a 911's steering feel,
you've taken away everything.

16:32.920 --> 16:37.810
It's a bit like... Does anybody remember,
we sold Fawlty Towers to the Americans, OK?

16:37.845 --> 16:40.975
They were going to remake it there and
couldn't make it gel with audiences

16:41.010 --> 16:45.600
and they said one of these characters isn't working,
so guess which character they got rid of?

16:45.635 --> 16:49.030
Sybil. Not Manuel. The major!

16:49.590 --> 16:50.580
Basil!

16:51.190 --> 16:56.290
They got rid of Basil Fawlty, so that Fawlty Towers
would work in America and that's what they've done.

16:56.325 --> 16:59.100
They've killed the thing that made it unique.

16:59.135 --> 17:01.775
So that is the end of the news.

17:01.810 --> 17:08.240
So, moving on, normally, when a new Ferrari is
launched, we test it on our track,

17:08.275 --> 17:12.560
but with this, the new FF,
we decided to push the boat out.

17:12.595 --> 17:15.105
So we decided to take it to the largest,

17:15.140 --> 17:18.900
most advanced automotive
test facility in the world,

17:19.680 --> 17:21.369
Arjeplog.

17:26.349 --> 17:29.765
Arjeplog used to be a small Swedish mining town,

17:29.800 --> 17:33.775
slap-bang in the middle of Europe's
last great wilderness.

17:33.810 --> 17:39.620
But since the 1980s, it's become the
winter home of Mercedes, Volkswagen, Toyota,

17:39.655 --> 17:44.217
General Motors, Ford and Fiat
and Peugeot and Renault.

17:44.252 --> 17:48.780
Whatever you drive, chances are,
it was developed here.

17:50.330 --> 17:54.085
Ordinarily, the population of this
little town is 3,000,

17:54.120 --> 17:59.790
but every year, as the snows begin to fall,
9,000 car engineers descend on the place

17:59.825 --> 18:05.440
to make sure that next year's models
start, stop, steer and continue to work

18:05.475 --> 18:10.140
even when the temperature falls down
to -30 degrees.

18:12.870 --> 18:15.835
So why have we brought this fragile
thoroughbred here?

18:15.870 --> 18:21.230
Well, that's simple - because it's the
first Ferrari ever to have four-wheel-drive.

18:22.710 --> 18:28.110
This means you can take it onto the test track,
which is on an enormous frozen lake.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.890
Sscary.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.880
And when you're there, you can do this.

18:46.490 --> 18:49.860
I'm pulling shapes, I'm pulling shapes now.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.510
Now, I have had more fun than
this in my life, I know I have,

18:56.770 --> 18:59.940
I just can't remember the moment when that was.

19:04.890 --> 19:14.150
Normally, you wouldn't dream of driving a 6.3-litre
650 horsepower V12 Ferrari, even in a light shower

19:14.185 --> 19:20.220
they're for cruising around Juan Les Pins
in your carefully designed topless swimsuit.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.695
But this? You can take this to San Moritz!

19:23.730 --> 19:26.400
Drink Napoleon brandy without
getting your lips wet.

19:27.380 --> 19:30.345
I'm on ice! I've got the traction control off

19:30.380 --> 19:35.330
and I'm doing 100 miles an hour.
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

19:36.780 --> 19:40.480
And thanks to the four-wheel-drive system,
I'm fine!

19:44.270 --> 19:48.350
Although actually, I'm only sort of fine,
because, if I'm honest,

19:48.385 --> 19:51.360
this thing does have
some slightly odd characteristics.

19:52.670 --> 19:56.360
It's so... Darting and... Aargh!

19:56.395 --> 19:59.070
God. This is very twitchy.

20:00.260 --> 20:03.770
It's a dead straight line, but look how much
steering I'm having to do in this thing.

20:04.750 --> 20:09.900
I'm endlessly adjusting the throttle,
endlessly sawing away at the wheel

20:09.935 --> 20:12.670
just to try and keep pointing
in the right direction.

20:14.830 --> 20:18.660
The reason it feels odd is because
Ferrari's four-wheel-drive system

20:18.695 --> 20:21.860
is unlike anything we've ever seen before.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.600
I'm going to sound like James May now,
but bear with me.

20:25.635 --> 20:27.725
In a normal four-wheel-drive car,

20:27.760 --> 20:32.990
the engine sends its power through the gearbox
to a transfer box, mounted somewhere here.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.325
That splits the power.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.230
Some of it goes down the shaft
to the back wheels,

20:38.265 --> 20:41.065
some of it down the shaft to those at the front.

20:41.100 --> 20:45.360
Obviously, the shaft going to the front
has to go underneath the engine,

20:45.395 --> 20:47.605
which means the engine has to be raised.

20:47.640 --> 20:53.090
Ferrari say that if you raise the engine,
that's bad for fuel economy, bad for styling,

20:53.125 --> 20:57.980
bad for handling, bad for everything
which they say matters.

21:00.680 --> 21:05.790
So in the FF, the power going to the back wheels
comes out of the back of the engine

21:05.825 --> 21:09.820
and the power going to the front
comes out of the front.

21:12.650 --> 21:15.905
This means it has to have two gearboxes.

21:15.940 --> 21:19.010
Because the one at the front is only very little,

21:19.045 --> 21:22.172
it can only ever handle 20% of the engine's power

21:22.207 --> 21:25.300
and if you go into fifth,
it shuts down completely.

21:27.930 --> 21:30.910
What it all means though,
is that for the first time ever,

21:30.945 --> 21:33.940
you can do this with a Ferrari.

21:40.220 --> 21:44.690
But is Ferrari's very complicated solution
really worth it?

21:47.670 --> 21:50.340
Bentley would argue that it isn't.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.860
This is the new Continental GT.

21:57.510 --> 22:02.680
It's a lighter, nimbler, sportier version
of the car Wayne Rooney drives.

22:06.520 --> 22:13.880
Instead of the massive, thirsty,
heavy six-litre twin turbo W12 engine in his car,

22:13.915 --> 22:18.890
this has a positively microscopic
twin turbo four-litre V8.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.430
It also has a conventional
four-wheel-drive system,

22:24.465 --> 22:26.915
so does that mean the engine's in the sky

22:26.950 --> 22:31.000
and the car wallows about like
an elephant perched on a beach ball?

22:31.710 --> 22:34.280
Tell you what, let's find out.

22:44.150 --> 22:47.320
Right now, it's very hard to see
why Ferrari has gone to

22:47.355 --> 22:49.655
all the trouble of reinventing the wheel,

22:49.690 --> 22:55.020
because... if I'm honest, this does not handle
like the Natural History Museum.

22:56.570 --> 23:00.330
For a big, old bruiser like this, it's good.

23:03.850 --> 23:07.560
I've never been a fan of the Continental,
but I'm loving this.

23:07.595 --> 23:11.150
Makes a good noise as well -
a dirty, dirty noise.

23:11.185 --> 23:13.160
That is a rude sound.

23:17.260 --> 23:21.390
So what we have here are two cars
that appear to be very similar.

23:25.210 --> 23:31.140
They're both red, they both have two doors,
four seats and four-wheel-drive -

23:31.590 --> 23:33.260
but there are some differences.

23:33.295 --> 23:35.050
One sings baritone,

23:35.920 --> 23:37.320
one sings tenor.

23:38.390 --> 23:42.420
The interior of the Bentley is simple,
classical, elegant.

23:42.455 --> 23:45.577
The interior of the Ferrari is a mess -

23:45.612 --> 23:48.665
all the knobs are on the steering wheel,

23:48.700 --> 23:51.530
there's a rev-counter in front of the passenger

23:51.565 --> 23:54.360
and most of the dials make no sense at all.

23:56.350 --> 23:59.270
Weirdly though,
the Ferrari is the most practical.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.570
It's got a bigger boot than a Renault Scenic

24:02.605 --> 24:04.045
and if you fold the back seats down,

24:04.080 --> 24:07.925
it's long enough to accommodate
what pass these days for skis.

24:07.960 --> 24:18.400
However, the Ferrari is 227,000-
that's 100,000 more than the Bentley.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.180
So, what about speed?

24:23.500 --> 24:29.730
Well, the next day, we carved a quarter-mile
drag strip into the lake to find out.

24:30.540 --> 24:34.580
If this were a dry piece of Tarmac,
the Ferrari would monster it.

24:34.615 --> 24:38.745
650 horsepower, this has 500.

24:38.780 --> 24:44.080
Ferrari has more torque and it's lighter.
Much, much lighter.

25:03.140 --> 25:08.110
Yes, traction control working well
for a blinding start for the Bentley.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.410
Oh, my word, it's in the lead!

25:14.940 --> 25:17.060
Come on, Bentley, come on!

25:18.550 --> 25:21.820
Getting a bit wobbly now,
and the Ferrari's coming!

25:25.550 --> 25:32.090
Oh, no, I can't deal with that power.
Oh, he's got tankslapper on! He is wobbly.

25:33.670 --> 25:35.870
But it's closer than I thought!

25:39.080 --> 25:42.240
In a straight line,
then, the Ferrari is the quickest,

25:42.275 --> 25:44.830
but how would they compare on a circuit?

25:45.390 --> 25:49.000
Well, to find out, we need a track,
and luckily, we have one -

25:49.035 --> 25:52.930
because what you see here,
bulldozed from the snow,

25:52.965 --> 25:57.050
is an inch-perfect replica of Silverstone.

26:09.250 --> 26:16.010
Copse, flat-out in a Formula 1 car,
I'm doing 47... And I've got a big slide on.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.120
Come on!

26:19.540 --> 26:26.140
Right, Chapel. Chapel's a long right, followed
by a gentle left onto the Hangar Straight

26:26.175 --> 26:29.660
this is uncanny.

26:31.730 --> 26:38.040
Why don't they have Formula 1 races here?
That would be proper comedy!

26:39.190 --> 26:40.900
Silverstone on ice.

26:42.950 --> 26:44.695
Braking point's a lot earlier here...

26:44.730 --> 26:54.070
Argh, surely not! Don't get stuck...
Oh, you stupid, STUPID thing! Man.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.680
Having established that our ice version
of Silverstone was all in order,

26:58.715 --> 27:02.230
we could now see which car could
get round the fastest.

27:02.990 --> 27:09.040
To find out, we need a man skilled in the potent
cocktail of big horsepower and little grip.

27:09.075 --> 27:12.770
And luckily, just such a man is arriving now.

27:12.805 --> 27:16.010
He's not the Stig's Alpine cousin,

27:16.045 --> 27:18.060
he's just The Stig.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.990
Apparently he's come all the way
across the North Sea in that.

27:29.470 --> 27:33.480
Soon, we had him out of the hovercraft
and into the Ferrari.

27:35.330 --> 27:41.630
5, 4.7, 2.3, one, go!

27:42.510 --> 27:53.660
So, here we go. A genuine 208mph racehorse
on one do-or-die lap.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.010
Did you go into fifth gear?

28:13.980 --> 28:15.580
You went into fifth, didn't you?

28:16.530 --> 28:21.570
I said don't go into fifth, it'll just become
rear-wheel drive, and then this'll happen.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.620
Eventually, we had him back on track
and look how hard he's having to work.

28:31.300 --> 28:36.150
The Ferrari has incredibly complex electronics
and that weird four-wheel-drive system,

28:36.185 --> 28:39.590
but this is not a car in which you can relax

28:39.625 --> 28:42.760
you have to drive it. You have to work.

28:46.800 --> 28:50.380
So, four minutes and four seconds.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.530
Then, it was the turn of the Bentley.

28:53.860 --> 28:59.340
5, 4.8, 2.7, 1, Go!

29:11.520 --> 29:13.755
but mostly cos it's simpler.

29:13.790 --> 29:18.600
It has that conventional four-wheel-drive system
and a normal automatic gearbox,

29:18.635 --> 29:20.685
rather than a flappy paddle manual.

29:20.720 --> 29:25.380
This is a car in which you can sit back
and let the machine do the work.

29:25.415 --> 29:29.700
Its V8 will even run on just
four cylinders to save fuel,

29:29.735 --> 29:32.180
but not here - not with Stig at the wheel.

29:32.215 --> 29:34.540
Look at him! Not doing anything.

29:35.820 --> 29:38.245
But will it be faster? Can it be faster?

29:38.280 --> 29:41.310
Coming round Club now, so we'll know soon enough.

29:46.060 --> 29:48.100
You hateful imbecile!

29:49.030 --> 29:53.245
Now that is actually a surprise -

29:53.280 --> 29:59.110
the Bentley did it in 3.51,
so that's 13 seconds quicker.

30:04.130 --> 30:09.280
When you are dancing on ice in Lapland,
the Bentley is the fastest.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.660
And I am glad about that because,
of the two, this is my favourite.

30:14.695 --> 30:17.120
I like it a lot.

30:19.260 --> 30:24.370
However, if I was going on a skiing holiday,
I would not use either of these.

30:26.550 --> 30:31.230
Because, if I wanted a car that would
get me to St Moritz,

30:31.265 --> 30:33.425
and then keep on working when I got there,

30:33.460 --> 30:40.110
I would use what the crew has been
using to film me here - A Range Rover.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.380
That was about as much fun as you can have.

30:56.290 --> 30:58.850
13 hours to get there but, God, it was fun.

30:58.885 --> 31:01.865
Interesting conclusion, though.

31:01.900 --> 31:04.580
I have actually driven
the Ferrari on a dry track,

31:04.615 --> 31:07.225
and to be honest,
it is not really a driver's car.

31:07.260 --> 31:12.170
Neither is the Bentley, and this is why
I arrived at that conclusion.

31:12.205 --> 31:15.202
If you don't want the last word
in handling precision -

31:15.237 --> 31:18.200
you just want four seats and
something that works on snow -

31:18.235 --> 31:20.107
you might as well have the Range Rover.

31:20.142 --> 31:21.945
Fair enough. Can I get back to the Ferrari?

31:21.980 --> 31:27.250
They have given it that wantonly
complicated four-wheel-drive system,

31:27.285 --> 31:30.025
just to lower the engine a bit?

31:30.060 --> 31:33.630
I will not dumb it down any more for you,
but that is the essence of it.

31:33.665 --> 31:35.965
It does seem a bit mad. It is.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.275
I think this is too complicated for its own good.

31:38.310 --> 31:43.090
Too big and expensive. It will depreciate like
a chest of drawers falling off a cliff.

31:46.710 --> 31:53.070
They should have called it
the Ferrari India Special.

31:56.870 --> 32:01.195
My guest tonight has appeared
in Inglourious Basterds, Shame, X-Men, Haywire,

32:01.230 --> 32:05.520
in fact, pretty well every film
that has come out in the last six months.

32:05.555 --> 32:09.737
He is half-German and half-Irish,
so, ladies and gentlemen,

32:09.772 --> 32:13.920
please say, "top of the morgen",
to Michael Fassbender..

32:30.140 --> 32:32.865
Now, in the olden days, and
I note children watching will not believe this,

32:32.900 --> 32:39.060
it was possible to go to the cinema and see a film
that did not have Michael Fassbender in it.

32:39.810 --> 32:47.240
You first came to my attention,
at least, in Inglourious Basterds, with your...

32:47.275 --> 32:49.115
Does everyone do that to you in the street?

32:49.150 --> 32:51.520
Yeah, exactly. And it still takes me..
I'm like, what's he doing?

32:51.555 --> 32:54.175
"I have done 18 films since then!"

32:54.210 --> 32:56.375
But Shame is the one people are talking about.

32:56.410 --> 33:00.650
You had to do, honestly,
a full frontal nude scene.

33:00.685 --> 33:05.905
Was it hard?

33:05.940 --> 33:10.100
I mean, this is an impressive sausage.

33:12.210 --> 33:13.720
I don't know what to say to that!

33:14.780 --> 33:18.360
So, can you say to your mum,
"Would you like to see my new movie?"

33:18.395 --> 33:22.415
Exactly, she was actually going to come
and see it in Venice

33:22.450 --> 33:25.925
and I said to my mum,
"Sure, come and we will watch it together."

33:25.960 --> 33:29.400
Enough months had passed for me to
think it wouldn't be that bad.

33:29.435 --> 33:32.942
Luckily, her back was playing up,
she has a bad lower back,

33:32.977 --> 33:36.450
and whether that was psychosomatic or not,
I do not know.

33:36.485 --> 33:39.575
But, thankfully, she didn't make it,

33:39.610 --> 33:42.640
because the first thing my dad said,
because he was behind me,

33:42.675 --> 33:45.670
he leaned over and said,
"Thank God your mother isn't here."

33:47.470 --> 33:51.855
I have been doing this show for ten years,
and I think in all of that time,

33:51.890 --> 33:56.180
only three or four of my friends
have ever asked for tickets for the show.

33:56.215 --> 34:00.470
This week, when people discovered
you were coming on, I had to get a minibus,

34:00.505 --> 34:02.125
and they are all girls.

34:02.160 --> 34:05.150
"Can we come and look at his...?"

34:05.185 --> 34:09.145
Lap time. Yes, exactly.

34:09.179 --> 34:14.260
Anyway, you have just done Shame,
where you spend the entire time naked.

34:14.295 --> 34:19.679
Now you are in a film where you get to
spank Keira Knightley. Yes.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.574
That is called Dangerous Method?
Dangerous Method.

34:22.610 --> 34:28.844
What is that about? It is sort of focusing
around Freud and Jung,

34:28.880 --> 34:35.045
and one of their mutual patients,
Sabina Spielrein, played by Keira,

34:35.080 --> 34:41.760
and basically, that sort of relationship,
the meetings of minds between Freud and Jung,

34:41.795 --> 34:44.237
and then the fracturing of that relationship,

34:44.272 --> 34:46.645
and she is kind of in the centre of it all.

34:46.679 --> 34:50.560
I think we have a clip of the trailer,
let us have a look.

34:50.594 --> 34:52.507
Sex? Male.

34:52.542 --> 34:54.376
Family? Child.

34:54.411 --> 34:56.210
Divorce? No.

34:57.930 --> 35:02.060
Why should we put so much effort into
suppressing our most basic natural instincts?

35:02.095 --> 35:06.620
There is a rumour that you have
taken a real patient as a mistress.

35:09.750 --> 35:12.190
Don't you think we should stop? you want to stop?

35:14.520 --> 35:18.280
Sometimes you have to do something unforgivable
just to be able to go on living.

35:20.440 --> 35:21.325
I'll have some of that.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.580
I like a bit of psychoanalysis.

35:25.950 --> 35:27.555
When you were reading the script for that

35:27.590 --> 35:31.455
and you got to the bit
where you spank Keira Knightley,

35:31.490 --> 35:35.610
how much more did you read before
you rang your agent to say you'd do it?

35:35.645 --> 35:37.665
It wasn't in the script.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.725
I sort of insisted. "Then I'll do it!"

35:39.760 --> 35:44.015
But you began, I think I am right in saying,
on Holby City.

35:44.050 --> 35:49.740
And then you were in a Guinness advert,
which must have been, well, perfect for you.

35:49.775 --> 35:55.430
Yeah, I mean, I said to them, "Is there anyway
you could give me a Guinness credit card,

35:55.465 --> 35:57.665
with a white line along the top,

35:57.700 --> 36:00.660
which means I can have free Guinness
for the rest of my life?"

36:00.695 --> 36:03.010
And did you get it?
Negative.

36:03.420 --> 36:04.565
That's annoying.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.935
Because you are not wholly Irish.
I am half-German.

36:07.970 --> 36:12.140
Half-German, half-Irish.
That is quite an odd combination.

36:12.175 --> 36:16.310
Like, "This must be done absolutely perfectly...
Tomorrow."

36:18.510 --> 36:20.165
It is that slightly different...

36:20.200 --> 36:24.490
One part of me wants to,
you know, be very efficient

36:24.525 --> 36:26.855
and the other side is a little bit reckless.

36:26.890 --> 36:31.710
And you are a Formula 1 fan?
So, is it Irvine or Schumacher?

36:31.745 --> 36:34.977
Schumacher. Schumacher?
So the German side comes out?

36:35.012 --> 36:38.626
Still Schumacher,
or have you now switched to Vettel?

36:38.661 --> 36:42.340
You know, I gotta say I'm still a Schumacher man.

36:42.375 --> 36:46.020
I mean, I would still like to see him get the car

36:49.260 --> 36:54.200
I don't know if it would be possible for him
to get up to Vettel's level.

36:54.235 --> 36:57.470
He has got it in him.
He is seven time world champion.

36:57.505 --> 36:59.305
I am with you. I think he is brilliant.

36:59.340 --> 37:04.880
Have you met him? I was lucky to get invited
to Silverstone last year

37:04.915 --> 37:07.782
and he did come out of the Mercedes garage

37:07.817 --> 37:10.615
and I was running behind him, like a stalker.

37:10.650 --> 37:14.580
And I was like, "Schumacher, Schumacher?"
And he kept walking.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.860
And he was kind of looking at me
with a bit of a smile

37:19.895 --> 37:22.340
and there was a lot of fear in his eyes.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.395
So, I did get the chance.

37:24.430 --> 37:27.660
Did you do that? No, no, he didn't know
who the hell I was!

37:29.060 --> 37:31.605
Obviously, you are a big Formula 1 fan.

37:31.640 --> 37:35.705
As far as I can work out,
you have only ever had one car?

37:35.740 --> 37:41.230
Yes. It was a Peugeot 306 turbo diesel
Spinnaker special edition.

37:43.050 --> 37:47.150
What is that? Was that just a local dealer
putting "Spinnaker" on it

37:47.185 --> 37:48.705
and charging an extra 500?

37:48.740 --> 37:51.940
Pretty much.
I think it had different coloured seats.

37:51.975 --> 37:54.892
I crashed it. I did it in.

37:54.927 --> 37:57.775
And that's that. Yeah.

37:57.810 --> 38:00.720
And I said to the guy when I brought the car up,
"These damn Peugeots".

38:00.755 --> 38:02.882
He was like,
"Well, the fellow at the Peugeot said

38:02.917 --> 38:05.010
they're not designed to go
over the kerb at 50mph."

38:07.350 --> 38:10.250
So what do you get around on, then,
if your Peugeot is being crashed?

38:10.285 --> 38:12.510
I use the motorcycle.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.325
I knew you would be happy about this

38:15.360 --> 38:22.500
I started with a Speed Triple,
and then I got the GS1200 BMW Adventure..

38:22.535 --> 38:25.735
May's got one of those.
It's an amazing piece of equipment.

38:25.770 --> 38:30.175
For the weight of it, when it is moving,
it is so well-balanced.

38:30.210 --> 38:33.200
Are you allowed to ride bikes
if you are involved in films all the time?

38:33.235 --> 38:36.215
Cos I would say, "No. They're too dangerous."

38:36.250 --> 38:41.980
Sometimes. I drove the Speed Triple
to Berlin for Inglourious Basterds.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.785
They were like, "We have the ticket..."

38:44.820 --> 38:46.210
And it was, "No, he will make his own way there."

38:46.245 --> 38:47.605
They were like, "OK."

38:47.640 --> 38:50.880
And I turned up on the bike,
and they went, "What the!"

38:52.980 --> 38:54.505
So, I couldn't ride when I was filming that.

38:54.540 --> 38:58.535
No, I just wouldn't allow anybody I knew
and liked to ride a motorcycle.

38:58.570 --> 39:02.530
That is why I encourage May and Hammond
to ride theirs as much as possible.

39:03.930 --> 39:06.680
So, obviously you came here to do your lap.

39:06.715 --> 39:09.395
How was the Stig out there? He is amazing.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.845
I think he was probably getting
a bit fed up of me

39:12.880 --> 39:16.760
because he is giving me the information
and I'm not putting it to use.

39:16.795 --> 39:21.450
He's jealous, because your helmet
is now more famous than his.

39:25.300 --> 39:29.630
I am talking about the one he wears in X-Men,
the Magneto helmet.

39:29.665 --> 39:32.335
Before you arrived, we had a bit of a problem.

39:32.370 --> 39:36.390
We have some footage of the preparation
which we have never had to do before.

39:36.425 --> 39:41.515
This is the second to last corner
and it was just sheet ice.

39:41.550 --> 39:48.230
We sent our boys out there to
try to get rid of most of it and it didn't help.

39:48.265 --> 39:50.910
Well, I mean,
I can't blame the ice, to be honest.

39:50.945 --> 39:54.290
Who would like to see the lap? ALL: Yes.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.540
Let's have a look.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.560
It looks dry. Was it slippery?

40:00.595 --> 40:01.875
Sweating!

40:01.910 --> 40:06.970
It was only really the second-to-last corner
where the ice was really playing.

40:07.005 --> 40:11.570
A few times, there was a bit too much squealing,
it was like a pig.

40:11.605 --> 40:12.765
That's good.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.710
Keeping that tidy, very tidy, actually.

40:15.745 --> 40:18.060
This is always a tricky one.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.730
A little bit wide. Yeah, way wide on that.

40:22.765 --> 40:24.690
A little bit. Not too bad.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.965
Hammerhead. How are we going to cope there?

40:31.000 --> 40:34.465
I cut that a bit by the looks of it.
A bit wide again.

40:34.500 --> 40:37.930
I would say that was all right,
actually, I'll reckon.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.430
Yes, all looking smooth as hell.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.785
Sweating like a cornered nun.

40:42.820 --> 40:47.055
Sweating like a cornered nun?!
Where did you get that from?

40:47.090 --> 40:50.990
That is where you spun off, on the slow lap?
Yes. Drifted over there.

40:51.420 --> 40:52.835
Yep, two wheels off.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.755
You can't cut that corner, can you?

40:55.790 --> 40:58.960
No, that's tricky. I kept cutting that.
That was a problem.

40:58.995 --> 41:00.847
That was all right through Gambon.

41:00.882 --> 41:02.700
And there we are, across the line!

41:12.090 --> 41:13.275
Where do you reckon?

41:13.310 --> 41:17.125
I say I would be happy at about 1:45.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.905
OK, 1:45. Somewhere around there.

41:19.940 --> 41:22.650
I do not think it will happen now.

41:22.685 --> 41:23.905
Well, it was...

41:23.940 --> 41:25.730
That ice on the second to last corner...

41:25.765 --> 41:27.380
Letting me down gently, I like it.

41:28.390 --> 41:32.310
Michael Fassbender, you did it in 1...

41:32.345 --> 41:33.720
40...

41:35.280 --> 41:36.560
2...

41:38.280 --> 41:40.410
..point 8.

41:43.510 --> 41:50.210
That is... The third fastest time we ever had!

41:50.245 --> 41:52.125
That's all right!

41:52.160 --> 41:55.750
With ice on the second-to-last corner!

41:58.070 --> 41:59.670
I was not expecting that at all.

42:00.700 --> 42:03.520
That is a fantastic time. I am happy with that.

42:03.555 --> 42:04.945
I am thrilled you could come.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.350
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Fassbender!

42:18.970 --> 42:21.780
In this country, we like to do everything
we possibly can

42:21.815 --> 42:24.580
to make life more pleasant for disabled people.

42:24.615 --> 42:27.215
We have Pelican Crossings that beep,

42:27.250 --> 42:29.500
and we have ramps in front of public buildings,

42:31.560 --> 42:34.675
Yes, and there is even a range of
off-road mobility scooters

42:34.710 --> 42:38.800
so that people with disabilities
can get out into the countryside and do rambling.

42:38.835 --> 42:41.582
Problem is, they don't look very off-roady to us.

42:41.617 --> 42:44.330
I mean, this is hardly
a Toyota Land Cruiser, is it?

42:44.365 --> 42:47.640
And they are fantastically expensive.

42:47.675 --> 42:49.475
This one is 6,500.

42:49.510 --> 42:54.740
Yes, and that gave us an idea, could we
do something genuinely worthwhile for once.

42:54.775 --> 43:00.860
Could we build an off-road mobility scooter
that does not cost a fortune?

43:00.895 --> 43:04.820
Yeah, well, the producers told us
we should go and do exactly that

43:04.855 --> 43:08.730
and then meet up in Wales for a series of tests.

43:10.230 --> 43:15.110
This is exactly the sort of damp,
muddy countryside that ramblists love.

43:15.145 --> 43:18.350
Ideal conditions, then, to test our machines.

43:19.970 --> 43:22.055
This is what I have created.

43:22.090 --> 43:26.010
I built it from two scooters so
I have ended up with two engines,

43:26.045 --> 43:28.475
four-wheel drive, the four at the back

43:28.510 --> 43:31.555
and four-wheel steering, the four at the front.

43:31.590 --> 43:37.500
It has lawnmower tyres, a sound system
and binoculars for bird-watching

43:37.535 --> 43:39.925
and with that in mind, check this out.

43:39.960 --> 43:43.875
This is a hide,
that fits over the top of the scooter

43:43.910 --> 43:48.602
so I can sneak up silently
without frightening birds,

43:48.603 --> 43:49.603
like the pied wagtail
and the... The coot.

43:54.435 --> 43:56.130
Crikey!

43:58.010 --> 43:59.510
Stephen Hawking has arrived.

44:01.220 --> 44:03.630
Weren't you listening to the challenge? Yes.

44:03.665 --> 44:06.607
It said mobility scooters, off-road.

44:06.642 --> 44:09.515
Forgive me for taking it seriously

44:09.550 --> 44:14.795
but as far as I can make out mobility scooters
of the people who have difficulty walking.

44:14.830 --> 44:20.040
I'm concerned with people who have no choice
but to be in this, which is a wheelchair.

44:20.075 --> 44:24.220
Why shouldn't people in wheelchairs
be able to go rambling?

44:24.255 --> 44:25.345
You are right.

44:25.380 --> 44:29.140
I was with some disabled children the other day,
confined to wheelchairs,

44:36.740 --> 44:40.730
This is not fast, if I am honest,
but it is versatile. It is going there.

44:40.765 --> 44:44.500
Once you get into the countryside, don't do that.

44:44.535 --> 44:45.925
You have a coffee machine.

44:45.960 --> 44:51.300
I have everything, drinks,
sat nav, electronic tablet.

44:51.335 --> 44:53.690
You mean an iPad? Exactly.

44:54.800 --> 44:58.430
What is this on the back?
It is a gravel dispenser.

44:58.465 --> 45:00.872
If you get stuck in a bog.

45:00.907 --> 45:03.245
What is this handle for?

45:03.280 --> 45:07.395
You are going up or down a steep bit,

45:07.430 --> 45:09.940
you wind it and it changes the angle of the seat.

45:10.850 --> 45:15.560
At this point the piece of the morning
was shattered by the arrival of the local boy.

45:17.070 --> 45:20.560
That is him making that noise, isn't it?
He looks like an idiot.

45:20.595 --> 45:24.720
He is an idiot. He's built a half-track.

45:24.755 --> 45:26.110
Hello!

45:28.220 --> 45:29.360
I know.

45:33.860 --> 45:36.048
Where did it say it is supposed to be electric?

45:36.480 --> 45:39.485
Isn't it in the regulations?

45:39.520 --> 45:40.885
Let me talk you through what I have done.

45:40.920 --> 45:44.905
The chassis is composed of two vehicles,
a mobility trike,

45:44.940 --> 45:50.140
and it is mated to one of those powered
wheelbarrows that builders used

45:50.175 --> 45:53.450
for cutting huge amounts
of stuff over rugged terrain

45:53.485 --> 45:55.945
and it has tremendous off-road capability

45:55.980 --> 45:59.775
and in such an environment we will need a winch.

45:59.810 --> 46:03.570
Not again. Have you mounted it
to the front wings?

46:03.605 --> 46:06.475
To the chassis, this time. I have learned.

46:06.510 --> 46:10.530
I've got incline-o-meter, because this can
achieve incredible angles of lean.

46:10.565 --> 46:12.272
This way, and that way.

46:12.307 --> 46:13.945
Jerrycans for extra fuel.

46:13.980 --> 46:19.450
This is important. We not only had to
build machines that worked better

46:19.485 --> 46:21.315
that what you can buy off the shelf off-road,

46:21.350 --> 46:24.560
but were cheaper.
This is the most important thing.

46:24.595 --> 46:28.570
Mine, all in, 2,700.

46:28.605 --> 46:31.475
2,400.

46:31.510 --> 46:36.320
1,200 for the trek, 1,200 for the wheelbarrow,
the rest was just sweat and work.

46:36.355 --> 46:38.710
Interesting. What was yours?

46:38.745 --> 46:39.755
2,000.

46:39.790 --> 46:43.105
That represents a massive saving.

46:43.140 --> 46:48.030
There we are. If you were disabled
and you want to go to the countryside...

46:48.065 --> 46:50.770
Exactly. Exactly.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.970
Obviously we would test our machines
in the hills later

46:55.005 --> 46:58.710
but first we had to make sure they work in towns.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.395
This is very important,

47:02.430 --> 47:05.920
a Range Rover does not just work
in the countryside,

47:05.955 --> 47:08.130
it has to work in the city as well.

47:08.165 --> 47:10.020
And so must this.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.400
What I normally do in towns is
going to the baker's.

47:23.280 --> 47:25.980
Morning. Have you got an iced finger?

47:32.370 --> 47:37.065
There are many regulations, as you would imagine,
this being Britain,

47:37.100 --> 47:41.760
governing the use of mobility scooters
and this meets almost all of them.

47:41.795 --> 47:46.217
I'm good for width, I'm good for length,
I'm good for speed.

47:46.252 --> 47:50.640
But I do have a problem with weight
and so does my scooter.

47:52.470 --> 47:53.390
Excuse me.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.690
Would it be... I hate to do this...

47:57.120 --> 48:00.000
I am trying to get down there and it is stuck,
I'm so sorry.

48:04.300 --> 48:05.710
It is not quite as easy as it looks.

48:06.860 --> 48:08.190
Again, sorry.

48:08.225 --> 48:09.670
Bye.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.705
Police man, I must be careful of the speed limit.

48:13.740 --> 48:16.450
I'm allowed to do four miles an hour
in built-up areas.

48:19.090 --> 48:20.125
That's more than 4!

48:20.160 --> 48:23.740
Feel the speed! The speed!

48:24.990 --> 48:26.745
Four miles an hour, officer.

48:26.780 --> 48:28.630
You look really uncomfortable in this.

48:28.665 --> 48:30.135
It is my first time.

48:30.170 --> 48:34.170
The first time you getting,
your feet are going like this.

48:34.205 --> 48:39.170
It is all this little wizard's hat.

48:39.205 --> 48:41.730
Just down there, come on.

48:43.390 --> 48:46.570
Three, two, one, go.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.260
Come on!

48:55.390 --> 48:56.290
That is all I have got.

48:56.810 --> 49:00.600
Here is the big test, will it fit in
a disabled lavatory?

49:02.770 --> 49:04.091
Yep!

49:05.900 --> 49:07.620
Morning! Just browsing!

49:10.620 --> 49:12.150
Ahh.. I'm sorry!

49:17.880 --> 49:19.620
Despite the mishaps...

49:22.270 --> 49:26.395
We decided our machines work well
in an urban environment

49:26.430 --> 49:32.230
so we headed back out to the fields,
where my half-track was even better.

49:32.830 --> 49:36.700
It seems able to tackle quite steep slopes
which is potentially good.

49:38.390 --> 49:41.215
Easy. Plenty of torque from that petrol engine.

49:41.250 --> 49:48.380
The suspension is working,
it climbed up there as if it was not there.

49:48.415 --> 49:51.600
Check my wildlife screen, that is a blackbird.

49:51.635 --> 49:54.905
I am driving in stealth mode.

49:54.940 --> 49:59.700
You can't see that because
I am well camouflaged. And silent.

50:01.220 --> 50:04.810
I have to say the four-wheel-drive system
is working magnificently well.

50:04.845 --> 50:10.080
The ride is good, the grip is good.
I have built a Land Rover here.

50:12.180 --> 50:14.840
Oh, no, I have run over my hide.

50:15.870 --> 50:18.600
Since the hide clearly needed more work..

50:21.220 --> 50:25.470
The producers told me to get rid of it
and then they gave us a challenge.

50:25.505 --> 50:28.620
You will now report to...

50:38.020 --> 50:42.180
Where you will take part in an off-road race.

50:42.215 --> 50:44.005
Hang on a minute, it gets worse.

50:44.040 --> 50:48.530
You will be working as a team
against a group of wounded servicemen

50:48.565 --> 50:51.980
who will be using the
off the shelf off-road scooters.

50:53.810 --> 51:00.310
The terrain we would have to cross was brutal,
wet grass, mud and steep wooded slopes.

51:00.345 --> 51:04.040
The finish line was on a mountain
three kilometres away.

51:04.075 --> 51:07.430
And this is who we were up against.

51:09.130 --> 51:13.225
You are Nick. Mark. Ben.

51:13.260 --> 51:16.000
Let's get your wounds worked out.

51:16.035 --> 51:18.865
Spinal injuries.

51:18.900 --> 51:21.920
Right leg. So that's nothing..?

51:21.955 --> 51:23.850
Kick it as what you want.

51:25.070 --> 51:26.115
Gone.

51:26.150 --> 51:28.800
And you are? Left arm, right leg.

51:28.835 --> 51:31.110
Left arm, right leg? Yeah.

51:31.145 --> 51:32.455
How did you do that?

51:32.490 --> 51:36.040
As I was spinning down I landed on ground first.

51:36.075 --> 51:38.305
Was it a bomb? Yes.

51:38.340 --> 51:41.180
Despite their injuries they were confident.

51:41.215 --> 51:44.020
Do you think honestly you will beat us? Yes.

51:44.055 --> 51:47.060
They're just playing mental games.

51:47.095 --> 51:48.245
Put some beers in it.

51:48.280 --> 51:53.310
A case of beers. A case of beers.

51:56.780 --> 51:59.915
The military boys used their orienteering skills

51:59.950 --> 52:03.050
to map out a manageable route for their scooters.

52:03.085 --> 52:04.580
Take it easy on the rocky bitt.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.580
We, however, was so confident in our engineering,

52:10.615 --> 52:13.825
we decided to go as the crow flies.

52:13.860 --> 52:16.960
We are being started with the
traditional Welsh hunting horn.

52:28.490 --> 52:29.550
Go!

52:39.110 --> 52:42.160
Come on! James!

52:42.430 --> 52:44.120
This is full speed!

52:45.040 --> 52:48.220
I hate it when they make us do a race.
I should have known.

52:51.930 --> 52:53.130
Let's get up this hill!

52:56.490 --> 52:59.290
There is no question mine is faster than yours!

52:59.325 --> 53:01.100
And quieter!

53:04.710 --> 53:06.510
Oh, no, my steering's jammed.

53:08.050 --> 53:09.385
I'm losing traction completely.

53:09.420 --> 53:12.490
Go forward, go forward.
Do a bit of convoy formation here, lads.

53:12.525 --> 53:13.470
That's a good effort.

53:14.400 --> 53:22.170
Yes! Now I can just engage seat angle alteration.

53:31.720 --> 53:34.260
While Sir Randolph May was stuck..

53:34.295 --> 53:35.035
What have you done?

53:35.070 --> 53:36.895
..I went to help the orang-utan.

53:36.930 --> 53:39.150
Try and get the bodywork off the wheel.

53:39.185 --> 53:41.370
If you try and turn the wheel to the left.

53:41.405 --> 53:43.512
This is teamwork now, isn't it?

53:43.547 --> 53:45.620
We're actually doing teamwork.

53:46.090 --> 53:47.485
What am I thinking of?

53:47.520 --> 53:49.520
I've got my gravel system to deploy.

53:49.555 --> 53:51.205
Watch this.

53:51.240 --> 53:57.750
Pulling the string dispenses gravel from the hopper
in front of the wheels, improving traction.

53:57.785 --> 53:59.510
Deploy...

54:02.610 --> 54:03.455
Hang a right.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.580
Right, go, go, go!

54:08.380 --> 54:13.060
Having mended Jeremy's scooter,
Thunderbird One then had to rescue me.

54:15.590 --> 54:20.440
Oh, this is just...glorious. Tremendous!

54:22.620 --> 54:23.600
Stop it!

54:34.810 --> 54:36.710
They're down there, look. There.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.465
Losers.

54:39.500 --> 54:41.625
How did you get there?

54:41.660 --> 54:43.715
We'll see you at the end.

54:43.750 --> 54:47.295
I feel a crate of beer coming on.

54:47.330 --> 54:50.840
Hammond! They're ahead of us!

54:50.875 --> 54:51.710
Go.

54:53.670 --> 54:54.880
Left here, Ben!

54:55.380 --> 54:56.285
Go on, go, go, go.

54:56.320 --> 54:58.975
Worried by the progress of our rivals,

54:59.010 --> 55:02.030
Hammond and I stopped to discuss our colleague.

55:02.065 --> 55:05.050
I mean, look at him. He's pretty pointless.

55:06.690 --> 55:09.740
There is a bit of a rise in the terrain, there.

55:11.750 --> 55:12.969
Nope.

55:15.090 --> 55:19.620
Do we, in these unique circumstances,
merely leave him? Mm-hm.

55:19.655 --> 55:21.565
Or shoot him and leave him?

55:21.600 --> 55:26.430
Because we were working as a team,
we decided to just leave him.

55:26.465 --> 55:31.040
I feel bad. I do. I feel bad. I'm getting better!

55:35.890 --> 55:39.520
Right... I think... That way.

55:41.720 --> 55:46.670
Pro Rider Road King is doing well here.
A moment of actual progress.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.130
Mate, we're rolling.

55:52.030 --> 55:55.660
I was rolling, too,
and had left Jeremy far behind.

55:56.450 --> 55:59.165
It's getting very muddy now, but that's OK.

55:59.200 --> 56:01.880
This is where tracks are absolutely perfect.

56:20.110 --> 56:21.645
Nav check. Be careful, man.

56:21.680 --> 56:25.620
That was that road we saw on top of the ridge.

56:25.655 --> 56:27.365
We're doing well, we're doing well.

56:27.400 --> 56:29.960
It's going to get tricky up there,
them contour lines.

56:29.995 --> 56:31.170
Yeah. Keep doing what we're doing.

56:33.800 --> 56:37.080
Sportster, this is Pro Rider Road King, come in.

56:37.115 --> 56:39.740
I may need your winch a tiny bit.

56:39.775 --> 56:41.350
Oh, God.

56:42.150 --> 56:45.780
Once again,
I had to abandon my pursuit of our rivals

56:45.815 --> 56:48.230
to go and rescue the orang-utan.

56:48.265 --> 56:49.870
What have you done?

56:51.250 --> 56:53.100
Let it rock. Go on!

56:54.210 --> 56:55.550
Yeah, that's much better.

56:56.120 --> 56:57.930
That isn't. Oh, no!

56:59.330 --> 57:02.510
Lovely jubbly! Go, go, go.

57:03.820 --> 57:11.770
The Pro Rider was eventually righted, but this
teamwork nonsense wasn't getting us anywhere.

57:11.805 --> 57:13.570
Ram me!

57:20.190 --> 57:23.990
Jeremy... Go.
It's going to be dark by the time I get there.

57:24.025 --> 57:27.345
Mate, I'm going to. Go. Be the team.

57:27.380 --> 57:33.090
And beat the soldiers on the Top Gear thing
that has suddenly become. Yes.

57:33.125 --> 57:35.990
I'm not giving in, but I don't
want you to wait any more.

57:37.780 --> 57:39.360
So long, Pro Rider.

57:40.730 --> 57:43.400
Obviously, the servicemen were in the lead,

57:43.435 --> 57:46.035
but they were still taking the long way round.

57:46.070 --> 57:49.200
If I'm going to stand a chance
of preserving my team's honour,

57:49.235 --> 57:51.120
I'm going to have to go straight up.

57:54.570 --> 57:57.610
To help me, my rivals were starting to struggle.

58:10.370 --> 58:11.165
We're through.

58:11.200 --> 58:14.340
Lesser vehicles would have been
just stumped by that.

58:21.590 --> 58:23.040
Landed right on my GPS.

58:25.180 --> 58:27.375
Meanwhile, much further back...

58:27.410 --> 58:33.020
Now that my weight is on
the back wheels, I have traction.

58:33.055 --> 58:35.977
Oh, yeah. I'm surfing now.

58:36.012 --> 58:38.865
If we bend it outwards...

58:38.900 --> 58:41.605
Mark's control panel had snapped off in the fall,

58:41.640 --> 58:45.010
and getting it fixed again had
cost them precious time.

58:45.045 --> 58:47.890
Did you hear that? Yeah, I can hear some engine.

58:47.925 --> 58:49.855
I can hear Hammond. Hammond?

58:49.890 --> 58:53.410
There's no BLEEP way he could have
got up here that fast. Go, go.

58:58.150 --> 59:00.225
Come on, don't stop, old Sportster!

59:00.260 --> 59:03.960
I've got to pick my lines,
keep it as level as I can.

59:05.860 --> 59:08.380
That's it, the summit's there.
That's it, that's the summit.

59:08.415 --> 59:11.590
Wahey! It's a race to the finish line.

59:14.260 --> 59:16.010
That's got to be the summit up there.

59:17.210 --> 59:19.150
Come on! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

59:20.880 --> 59:22.020
Last push now, boys.

59:24.580 --> 59:26.020
I'm going to make it!

59:27.570 --> 59:29.600
Keep going, keep going. Go, go, go.

59:29.635 --> 59:30.620
Last little bit.

59:33.220 --> 59:35.670
Yes! This is it. This is the summit.

59:41.550 --> 59:42.770
All right, lads?

59:42.805 --> 59:43.965
Welcome.

59:44.000 --> 59:47.490
Well done, mate. Well done, well done.

59:47.525 --> 59:48.735
It's just me.

59:48.770 --> 59:51.780
Meanwhile, far, far away...

59:52.870 --> 59:55.935
Now, look at this. It's a 17th-century pub.

59:55.970 --> 01:00:00.960
And look at that step there. If you were
in a normal conventional electric wheelchair,

01:00:00.995 --> 01:00:05.297
that would be game over and no pint.

01:00:05.332 --> 01:00:09.600
But now, watch this. Full power.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.660
Hang on.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.450
Oh, COCK
Oh, cock.

01:00:26.485 --> 01:00:28.240
Still, could be worse.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.225
Fenton! Fenton!

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:37.590
Fenton! Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.295
Mine was terrible.

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:46.560
I'm glad I pushed it down the hill
and made Fenton jokes about it.

01:00:46.595 --> 01:00:47.950
Because it was rubbish.

01:00:47.985 --> 01:00:49.095
I'm sorry. What?

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:50.950
Mine was a lot worse.

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:55.230
I have to say, mine was brilliant. Er, it wasn't!

01:00:55.265 --> 01:00:56.935
It was. It was the only one who made it.

01:00:56.970 --> 01:01:00.750
I don't think you were, Hammond,
because you were beaten by these chaps.

01:01:00.785 --> 01:01:01.825
I was, I was.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.014
So, James, have you got something for them?

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:09.740
Yes, it is an absolute pleasure, gentlemen,
to give you, as promised, beer,

01:01:09.775 --> 01:01:12.150
Well done, guys. Well done, chaps.

01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:12.980
You've earned it.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:18.275
Now, can I just ask, because, as you know,

01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:22.130
Top Gear is famous throughout
the world for its consumer advice,

01:01:22.165 --> 01:01:24.810
so which one of these three
would you say was the best?

01:01:24.845 --> 01:01:25.600
This one wins hands down.

01:01:25.635 --> 01:01:26.605
The trike? Yeah.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.620
But that's still expensive. What is it, five...

01:01:28.655 --> 01:01:30.985
5,000. It's 5,000.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.930
I think I've got the answer to this, actually.

01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:34.645
It's carmakers.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.135
Because you know how
they are always branching out

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:41.470
and they make things like trendy designer kettles
and overpriced carbon fibre mountain bikes,

01:01:41.505 --> 01:01:43.245
why don't they just stop all that
and concentrate on

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.800
making an affordable, off-road wheelchair
or scooter that works?

01:01:47.835 --> 01:01:50.267
If you think about it,
this is a really good idea.

01:01:50.302 --> 01:01:52.700
Carmakers making wheelchair, this is a good idea.

01:01:52.735 --> 01:01:56.155
It is a good idea, and it's on Top Gear.

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:59.670
And that is a bombshell, so let's end quickly.

01:01:59.705 --> 01:02:01.520
See you next week, take care, good night!

01:02:02.305 --> 01:02:08.294
