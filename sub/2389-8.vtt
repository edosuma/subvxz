00:00.992 --> 00:03.228
Kids,
Barney's mom had this blouse

00:03.229 --> 00:05.363
<i>that she absolutely loved,</i>

00:05.365 --> 00:07.031
<i>but then Robin won it</i>
<i>in a poker game,</i>

00:07.033 --> 00:09.200
<i>which led</i>
<i>to some slight awkwardness.</i>

00:09.202 --> 00:13.070
You won the battle...
but I'll win the war.

00:13.072 --> 00:14.906
Game on, bitch.

00:14.908 --> 00:18.459
<i>Please, Mom,</i>
<i>I need you to just be cool.</i>

00:18.461 --> 00:20.011
Okay, can you do that for me?

00:20.013 --> 00:21.078
For you, yes.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.579
And for Robin?

00:22.581 --> 00:23.965
She's gonna be

00:23.967 --> 00:25.916
your daughter in 33 hours.

00:25.918 --> 00:26.884
Daughter in <i>law.</i>

00:26.886 --> 00:28.135
Making it illegal

00:28.137 --> 00:30.137
for you not
to treat her like a daughter.

00:30.139 --> 00:31.856
In-lawyered.

00:32.473 --> 00:33.757
Please, Mom.

00:33.759 --> 00:36.527
All Robin wants to do is
put this whole thing behind her

00:36.529 --> 00:39.397
so she can get married and
put this whole thing behind her.

00:39.399 --> 00:41.282
Ah! Get-this-over-with-quickly
so-we-can

00:41.284 --> 00:44.201
move-past-how-awkward-it-was
that-I-just-said-that five!

00:44.203 --> 00:46.370
Fine. If Robin's ready
to bury the hatchet,

00:46.372 --> 00:49.040
then I guess
I'm ready to bury the hatchet.

00:49.042 --> 00:51.742
Morning, bitches.
Like my new blouse?

00:51.744 --> 00:53.744
Oh, hell, <i>no!</i>
No, Mom. Mom!

00:53.746 --> 00:54.996

<i>Kids, not far</i>
<i>from the Farhampton Inn,</i>

01:09.962 --> 01:10.978
<i>there's a lighthouse.</i>

01:10.980 --> 01:12.796
<i>It's a really special place,</i>

01:12.798 --> 01:15.433
<i>and that morning</i>
<i>I wanted to see it for myself.</i>

01:15.435 --> 01:16.684
<i>There was just one problem.</i>

01:16.686 --> 01:18.969
Look, I'm sorry, Ted, but-but

01:18.971 --> 01:21.638
I can't in good faith send
a lonely guy like yourself

01:21.640 --> 01:23.824
to the top
of a very romantic,

01:23.826 --> 01:26.744
and more to the point,
a very tall lighthouse.

01:28.647 --> 01:31.115
I don't want your blood
on my hands,

01:31.117 --> 01:34.118
and I mean that literally,
because it would be my job to...

01:34.120 --> 01:36.170
to hose down the rocks.

01:36.172 --> 01:38.506
<i>Now, late the night before,</i>

01:38.508 --> 01:41.258
<i>thanks to Marshall's</i>
<i>travel companion, Daphne,</i>

01:41.260 --> 01:44.011
<i>Lily had received</i>
<i>some unsettling news.</i>

01:44.013 --> 01:45.579
I'm gonna be a judge.

01:45.581 --> 01:47.882
<i>Screwing up their</i>
<i>whole plan to move to Italy.</i>

01:47.884 --> 01:49.166
<i>She wasn't happy.</i>

01:49.168 --> 01:50.801
Yes, I'm in a rotten mood.

01:50.803 --> 01:52.219
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

01:52.221 --> 01:53.788
Yes, this has
booze in it.

01:53.790 --> 01:55.272
No, it's not
my first.

01:55.274 --> 01:57.641
You want to make this brunch
a drunch?

01:57.643 --> 01:59.810
You do you, I'm not gonna judge.

02:01.279 --> 02:02.346
I'm gonna be a judge.

02:02.348 --> 02:04.065
Judge.

02:05.734 --> 02:08.536
Thank you, Linus.

02:08.538 --> 02:09.954
<i>As for Marshall and Daphne,</i>

02:09.955 --> 02:11.522
<i>they got caught</i>
<i>in that big storm.</i>

02:11.524 --> 02:13.874
<i>Luckily, they had a place</i>
<i>to crash for the night.</i>

02:13.876 --> 02:15.826
<i>My childhood home.</i>

02:15.828 --> 02:19.246
<i>Okay, that sign</i>
<i>might not have been there.</i>

02:19.248 --> 02:21.832
Thank you so much for letting
us stay the night, Mrs. Mosby.

02:21.834 --> 02:22.967
Oh, it's our pleasure.

02:22.969 --> 02:25.002
I'm just glad that storm has passed.
Oh.

02:25.004 --> 02:27.355
But there's one storm
that hasn't passed,

02:27.357 --> 02:29.373
isn't there, Marshall?

02:29.375 --> 02:31.058
Hey, Clint.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.043
You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Marshall?

02:33.045 --> 02:34.395
I'm talking about the one
that's been raining

02:34.397 --> 02:37.982
cats and dogs all over
this-this, this friendship.

02:37.984 --> 02:39.266
This isn't a friendship.

02:39.268 --> 02:40.768
Oh.

02:40.770 --> 02:42.719
Nice.

02:42.721 --> 02:45.489
We're reluctant
travel companions.

02:45.491 --> 02:46.857
Well, little known fact
about me.

02:46.859 --> 02:48.109
I'm an almost-graduate

02:48.111 --> 02:51.195
of the Conflict Resolution
program over at... at Tri-C.

02:51.197 --> 02:54.281
I even had my own practice
at Van Aken Plaza

02:54.283 --> 02:55.566
before the manager
of the Wendy's

02:55.568 --> 02:57.468
made me stop hogging the booth.

02:57.470 --> 03:00.121
The point is,
I can fix this.

03:00.123 --> 03:01.705
Oh, I don't know, Clint.

Okay, you know what?
We have to hit the road.

03:12.769 --> 03:16.253
But, um, Mrs. Mosby, do you
mind if I take this mug?

03:16.255 --> 03:17.938
I would very much like

03:17.940 --> 03:20.057
to make fun of Ted
next time I see him.

03:20.059 --> 03:21.258
Of course.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.810
You know, when Ted was seven,

03:22.812 --> 03:25.563
he and his best friend
took this Wild West photo

03:25.565 --> 03:26.864
together at Geauga Lake.

03:26.866 --> 03:28.382
I could go look for it.

03:28.384 --> 03:29.733
We really should get going.

03:29.735 --> 03:30.935
His best friend was a balloon.

03:30.936 --> 03:32.069
What's a few more minutes?

03:32.071 --> 03:34.104
Yeah, you're gonna want that.

03:34.106 --> 03:36.574
So... what's everyone
doing this morning?

03:36.576 --> 03:39.109
Oh, well, I kind of feel
like playing some tennis.

03:39.111 --> 03:40.578
Maybe we should reserve a court.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.046
Court.

03:44.416 --> 03:46.734
Thank you, Linus.

03:46.736 --> 03:48.752
Pancakes and eggs, Robin?

03:48.754 --> 03:51.955
I guess that blouse won't be
loose and flowy for long.

03:51.957 --> 03:52.789
Mom...

03:52.791 --> 03:53.891
Keep talking, Loretta.

03:53.893 --> 03:56.177
I've been waiting
all morning to...

03:56.179 --> 03:57.961
ketchup.

03:57.963 --> 03:59.396
Oops.

03:59.398 --> 04:03.150
You're not supposed to put
ketchup on scrambled eggs.

04:03.152 --> 04:04.935
Right, Loretta, because

04:04.937 --> 04:07.471
you're the queen
of scrambled eggs.

04:07.473 --> 04:08.305
Actually, that's

04:08.307 --> 04:09.773
exactly what she is.

04:09.775 --> 04:10.941
When Mom was

04:10.943 --> 04:12.309
a groupie in the '70s,

04:12.311 --> 04:15.746
her scrambled eggs made her the
darling of the MSG loading dock.

04:15.748 --> 04:18.199
Lot of songs written
about those scrambled eggs.

04:18.201 --> 04:19.983
ZZ Top's "She's Got Legs"?

04:19.985 --> 04:21.702
Originally "She's Got Eggs."

04:21.704 --> 04:22.586
Led Zeppelin?

04:22.588 --> 04:23.921
"Scramble On."

04:23.923 --> 04:25.206
Steve Miller?

04:25.208 --> 04:26.624
"The Yolker."

04:26.626 --> 04:28.843
If you listen to Pink Floyd's
<i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>

04:28.845 --> 04:31.962
while eating her eggs,
it lines up perfectly.

04:31.964 --> 04:35.432
While I'm sure it was
your mother's cooking skills

04:35.434 --> 04:39.103
that made her so popular with
Zed Zed Top and their ilk,

04:39.105 --> 04:40.688
I know for a fact

04:40.690 --> 04:43.357
that she does not make
the best scrambled eggs.

04:43.359 --> 04:46.694
Because my mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

04:48.364 --> 04:50.347
<i>Kids, we've known</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin</i>

04:50.349 --> 04:52.116
<i>for eight years at that point,</i>

04:52.118 --> 04:54.285
<i>and here's what we knew</i>
<i>about her mom.</i>

04:54.287 --> 04:55.452
My mom is terrified
of flying.

04:57.073 --> 04:59.073
My mom got stung
by a jellyfish.

05:00.409 --> 05:01.909
My mom makes
the best scrambled eggs.

05:03.045 --> 05:05.229
<i>And... that's everything.</i>

05:05.231 --> 05:07.464
In fact, she should be here
any minute.

05:07.466 --> 05:08.632
Barney,

05:08.634 --> 05:10.534
maybe she can cook you
some real scrambled eggs

05:10.536 --> 05:12.369
so you can see what
you've been missing.

05:12.371 --> 05:14.555
Don't do this, Robin.
You can't win the egg war.

05:14.557 --> 05:16.390
Canadian scrambled eggs,
how quaint.

05:16.392 --> 05:18.542
Does your mom put maple syrup
on them?

05:18.544 --> 05:20.544
Ha, ha, ha,
this is all very friendly.

05:20.546 --> 05:21.878
Get out of this now.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.648
Why not? We put maple syrup
on everything else.

05:26.318 --> 05:27.401
Aw.

05:27.403 --> 05:29.770
That's it!

05:29.772 --> 05:32.022
We need your omelet station.

05:32.024 --> 05:35.526
My son's fiancée is
about to get served...

05:35.528 --> 05:37.745
some delicious
scrambled eggs.

05:37.747 --> 05:41.031
Or I could go out to the
driveway and eat some gravel.

05:42.168 --> 05:44.535
Wait. Sorry.
Did you say gravel or gavel?

05:44.537 --> 05:45.869
Gravel. Why would
I say gavel?

05:45.871 --> 05:47.204
Gavel.

05:51.127 --> 05:52.259
Thank you, Linus.

05:52.261 --> 05:54.128
Curtis, can I please

05:54.130 --> 05:56.297
have a map to the lighthouse?

05:56.299 --> 05:58.215
It's a very romantic lighthouse.

05:58.217 --> 05:59.416
I can't even have a map?

05:59.418 --> 06:01.552
It's a very romantic map.

06:01.554 --> 06:03.387
I can't let you go
without a date.

06:03.389 --> 06:04.805
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

06:04.807 --> 06:07.308
What happened to that girl Cassie?
Cassie?

06:07.310 --> 06:09.059
<i>Cassie was the girl I'd spent</i>

06:09.061 --> 06:10.927
<i>the entire previous night</i>
<i>consoling.</i>

06:10.929 --> 06:14.148
<i>Just consoling.</i>

06:14.150 --> 06:15.065
Yeah, that's not happening.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.117
<i>And then, in her anger,</i>

06:17.119 --> 06:18.935
<i>Lily gave me a piece of advice</i>

06:18.937 --> 06:20.454
<i>about which</i>
<i>she would later say...</i>

06:20.456 --> 06:23.657
Oh, mama, that was
some bad advice.

06:23.659 --> 06:25.459
Okay, here's why
you're an idiot.

06:25.461 --> 06:27.661
Did you find
Cassie attractive?

06:27.663 --> 06:30.947
I guess.
Is she a relatively normal height?

06:30.949 --> 06:33.950
Yeah.
So end up with her already.

06:33.952 --> 06:35.919
God, do you really think

06:35.921 --> 06:37.954
that you're gonna find
some perfect girl

06:37.956 --> 06:41.225
who checks off every
item on your list?

06:41.227 --> 06:42.643
Well, not every item.

06:42.645 --> 06:45.012
I mean, she doesn't have
to share my love for coins.

06:45.014 --> 06:47.398
Although it would
be nice, just once,

06:47.400 --> 06:50.801
not to have to go stag
to Coin-Con.

06:50.803 --> 06:53.237
Pull your head out
of your ass, Mosby.

06:53.239 --> 06:56.139
Do you think Marshall
always makes me happy?

06:56.141 --> 06:59.410
I mean, sometimes being
with him is a real trial.

06:59.412 --> 07:01.445
Real trial.

07:01.447 --> 07:02.463
Huh.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.248
Did it to myself that time.

07:04.250 --> 07:07.818
Look, Ted, it's
time to settle.

07:07.820 --> 07:09.953
Take this normal-sized chick
up to the lighthouse

07:09.955 --> 07:11.338
and fall in love with her

07:11.340 --> 07:15.042
and quit bothering us with
your dumb love life stuff.

07:15.044 --> 07:18.328
God, I am so sick of being
smarter than everyone else.

07:19.798 --> 07:20.798
You're slipping, Linus.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.300
We're running
out of glasses.

07:29.307 --> 07:32.059
Do you want to just go
to the stupid lighthouse?

07:32.061 --> 07:34.111
Ooh, zitch dog.

07:34.113 --> 07:35.729
Cocker spaniel in the Jetta.

07:35.731 --> 07:37.948
That's Marshall
Eriksen-- 28,

07:37.950 --> 07:39.015
Daphne-- zero.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.818
For the 28th time,

07:40.820 --> 07:43.037
I'm not playing
your stupid game!

07:43.039 --> 07:44.455
Oh, stupid, huh?

07:44.457 --> 07:45.522
That's great.

07:45.524 --> 07:47.541
I guess Daphne gets
to pick the music

07:47.543 --> 07:50.026
and crap all over
my fun road-trip games.

07:50.028 --> 07:52.296
You know, maybe
Clint was right.

07:52.298 --> 07:54.465
Maybe we do need
conflict resolution.

07:54.467 --> 07:55.666
I knew you guys
would come around.

07:59.274 --> 08:01.942
<i>And so I made up my mind</i>
<i>to settle for Cassie.</i>

08:02.164 --> 08:04.998
So, um, what kind
of music do you like?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.867
Hmm... nothing.

08:09.971 --> 08:11.722
<i>Still, I felt optimistic.</i>

08:11.724 --> 08:13.807
<i>After all,</i>
<i>Cassie was cute and single</i>

08:13.809 --> 08:16.310
<i>and heck, it's not like</i>
<i>the universe was telling us</i>

08:16.312 --> 08:17.711
<i>we shouldn't be together.</i>

08:22.767 --> 08:25.319
Here we are. Enjoy.

08:25.321 --> 08:26.720
happy wife,
happy life.

08:26.722 --> 08:28.021
Pretend
they're just okay.

08:28.023 --> 08:31.274
Please, Lily,
I think I can manage to...

08:32.193 --> 08:34.160
Oh, my God.

08:34.163 --> 08:35.361
I'm eight years
old again,

08:35.364 --> 08:36.712
and life is perfect,

08:36.715 --> 08:39.149
and I haven't peed my shorts
in front of 350 Webelos

08:39.150 --> 08:41.885
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.053
I'm sorry, Robin.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.388
What do you think, Lily?

08:44.390 --> 08:47.040
Oh, my God,
they are so delicious.

08:47.042 --> 08:49.409
Even more delicious than
finding out Barney peed himself

08:49.411 --> 08:52.295
at the Pinewood Derby Regionals
in Wheeling, West Virginia.

08:52.297 --> 08:53.847
I'm sorry, Robin.

08:53.849 --> 08:54.765
Mmm.
Come on,

08:54.767 --> 08:55.849
they can't be
that good.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.634
Oh!

08:57.636 --> 08:59.553
Excuse me, Mrs. Stinson,
some of our guests

08:59.555 --> 09:01.254
smelled your scrambled eggs
and were wondering

09:01.256 --> 09:03.523
if you could make some
for them as well.

09:03.525 --> 09:05.091
Oh, I don't think I should...

09:05.093 --> 09:08.362
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!
Eggs! Eggs! Eggs!

09:08.364 --> 09:09.813
Eggs! Eggs!

09:09.815 --> 09:11.281
Clint, what are
you doing here?

09:11.283 --> 09:14.067
What the Ohio State Board of
Holistic Medicine has repeatedly

09:14.069 --> 09:17.287
told me I'm in no way qualified
to do: my job.

09:17.289 --> 09:20.440
When I see a conflict
needs resolving, I must act.

09:20.442 --> 09:22.376
Plus, Ted's mom wanted me out
of the house.

09:22.378 --> 09:24.711
So, today, we're gonna build
a new paradigm

09:24.713 --> 09:26.246
of understanding,

09:26.248 --> 09:29.049
and then you're gonna swoop me
on back to Shaker Heights.

09:29.051 --> 09:30.083
Oh, I need to stop

09:30.085 --> 09:31.551
at Record Rev on Coventry.

09:31.553 --> 09:32.836
My vaporizer's ready.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.504
Marshall, pull over
and dump this hippie

09:34.506 --> 09:35.922
on the side of the road.

09:35.924 --> 09:37.123
I can't do that.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.892
♪ Gonna resolve
some conflicts ♪

09:38.894 --> 09:40.560
♪ Gonna resolve some conflicts

09:40.562 --> 09:41.961
Daphne picks the music.

09:41.963 --> 09:43.296

09:43.298 --> 09:45.015

Oh, come on.
Daphne picks the music!

09:46.902 --> 09:49.736
Ow! Stupid racecar!

09:49.738 --> 09:51.905
This is why children
should not have toys!

09:51.907 --> 09:53.907
Look, maybe this lighthouse
thing isn't such a good idea.

09:53.909 --> 09:55.075
No, you don't.

09:55.576 --> 09:56.810
You committed,

09:56.812 --> 09:58.945
and so did I, so let's go.

09:59.864 --> 10:01.915
Oh. Ow! Oh!

10:01.917 --> 10:03.784
Actually, it's feeling better.

10:03.786 --> 10:05.285
Ow! Oh! No, it's not.

10:05.287 --> 10:07.287
Oh.

10:07.289 --> 10:09.089
Mom, I don't know
why your phone is off.

10:09.091 --> 10:11.291
Maybe you left your charger
in the pickup truck.

10:12.544 --> 10:14.344
But I need you to get here
as fast  possible.

10:14.346 --> 10:15.429
I know
you're probably gonna want

10:15.431 --> 10:16.830
to take a hot bath
when you get in.

10:17.549 --> 10:18.765
She fits in a bathtub.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.684
That's good news. Unless...

10:20.686 --> 10:22.702
Oh, God, how big are
Canadian bathtubs?

10:22.704 --> 10:24.855
People ever line up

10:24.857 --> 10:26.106
like this for your mom's eggs?

10:26.108 --> 10:30.193
Loretta, even <i>I</i> could make
better eggs than this.

10:30.195 --> 10:31.945
Oh, I'd love it
if you'd come teach me

10:31.947 --> 10:33.146
how to make scrambled eggs.

10:33.148 --> 10:34.948
It's a scramble-off,
everybody!

10:34.950 --> 10:37.033
A scramble-off
to the death!

10:37.035 --> 10:39.319
Someone go watch
for the cops!

10:39.321 --> 10:41.404
Maybe we should have read up
on this town

10:41.406 --> 10:43.540
before booking our wedding.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.460
Let's do some,
"When you... I feel."

10:46.462 --> 10:47.861
All right, for example,

10:47.863 --> 10:51.164
when you don't
do trust falls,

10:51.166 --> 10:55.218
I feel like you
should do trust falls.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.838
So just do the
damn trust falls.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.872
I'm driving a car, Clint.

10:58.874 --> 11:00.307
Okay,

11:00.309 --> 11:03.176
uh, Daphne, when you say
"Drill, baby, drill"

11:03.178 --> 11:06.062
every time
that we pass a gas station,

11:06.064 --> 11:08.014
I feel invalidated.

11:08.016 --> 11:10.517
Marshall, when you talk,
I feel shut up!

11:10.519 --> 11:12.385
That's very good, both of you.

11:12.387 --> 11:14.237
Really? Both of us?

11:14.239 --> 11:16.439
Name one energy
that's better than oil.

11:16.441 --> 11:17.991
Wind, solar, hydroelectric.

11:17.993 --> 11:19.576
You see what I've been dealing
with, Clint?

11:19.578 --> 11:21.862
♪ The sticky petroleum
clings... ♪

11:21.864 --> 11:23.029
Please not now, Clint.

11:23.031 --> 11:25.732
♪ To the pelican's
broken wings ♪

11:25.734 --> 11:29.669
♪ Hey, Mr. Oilman,
what have you done... ♪

11:29.671 --> 11:31.571
Stop, stop, stop, please.
Enough! Clint,

11:31.573 --> 11:33.373
I'm tired of your beard
and I'm tired

11:33.375 --> 11:35.542
of this stupid therapy session.
And I'm tired

11:35.544 --> 11:39.078
of the way that your songs have
a-a laxative effect on Marvin!

11:39.080 --> 11:41.080
And on me. Every time
Clint starts singing,

11:41.082 --> 11:42.849
I just got to go.
Yeah.

11:42.851 --> 11:46.753
It's like, uh, the only
trust fall when you sing

11:46.755 --> 11:50.724
is that I "trust"
that a piece of poop

11:50.726 --> 11:54.277
is gonna "fall" out
of my son's butt.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.064
Hey, Clint, how about that?

11:58.066 --> 11:59.733
You got us to agree on something.
Yeah.

11:59.735 --> 12:02.652
We both think you're a loser.

12:02.654 --> 12:04.771
This therapy works.

12:04.773 --> 12:06.156
No!

12:06.158 --> 12:08.124
That is not the way
therapy works at all!

12:08.126 --> 12:10.109
Do you think this is
some kind of a joke?!

12:10.111 --> 12:11.745
This is my career!

12:11.747 --> 12:14.664
I will not go back to
coaching the Browns!

12:14.666 --> 12:15.665
Why can't people take

12:15.667 --> 12:17.083
what I do seriously?!

12:17.085 --> 12:20.086
God!

12:22.457 --> 12:24.724
Oh, my God. One more.

12:24.726 --> 12:27.894
Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God.

12:30.315 --> 12:33.650
God, that was a lot of stairs.
I'm exhausted.

12:33.652 --> 12:35.635
My chest is on fire.

12:35.637 --> 12:36.987
Oh.

12:36.989 --> 12:41.074
Ooh! So, Mr. Arch-itect,

12:41.076 --> 12:42.826
what do we do now?

12:42.828 --> 12:45.412
Fall in love or something?

12:45.414 --> 12:47.497
<i>And, kids, as I stood</i>
<i>on that lighthouse</i>

12:47.499 --> 12:50.817
<i>and looked at that girl, I felt</i>
<i>something happen inside me,</i>

12:50.819 --> 12:53.336
<i>something that had only</i>
<i>happened one other time</i>

12:53.338 --> 12:55.255
<i>in my entire adult life.</i>

12:57.342 --> 12:59.042
<i>Okay, scrambled eggs.</i>

12:59.044 --> 13:00.844
Here we go.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.146
Where is the egg opener?

13:04.515 --> 13:07.333
Never mind. I'll pre-scramble
them. It's fine.

13:08.386 --> 13:11.004
Okay, fine, Loretta.
You know what? You win.

13:11.006 --> 13:11.838
I don't
know how

13:11.840 --> 13:14.007
to cook egg.

13:14.009 --> 13:15.942
If you don't even know how
to make scrambled eggs,

13:15.944 --> 13:17.343
I just worry what
kind of breakfast

13:17.345 --> 13:19.980
you're gonna be serving
my grandchildren.

13:19.982 --> 13:21.781
Well, lucky you

13:21.783 --> 13:25.235
because that is one thing you
won't ever have to worry about.

13:33.244 --> 13:36.463
Mom, Robin
can't have kids.

13:39.248 --> 13:42.889
Every single job I take on,
it's always the same!

13:42.890 --> 13:45.474
"The coffee maker has to stay
in the office, Clint!"

13:45.476 --> 13:49.478
"You still have to wear pants
on Casual Friday, Clint!"

13:49.480 --> 13:50.312
"We didn't

13:50.314 --> 13:51.563
hire you, Clint!"

13:51.565 --> 13:52.964
Well, God,
I'm-I'm...

13:52.966 --> 13:54.466
I'm just sick of it. I'm si...

13:54.468 --> 13:57.802
Ow. Ow. Oh, I can hear
my blood right now.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.938
I'm having an attack.
I'm having a blood attack.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.106
A blood attack?

14:01.108 --> 14:02.441
Yeah. Pull over. I need...
I-I need to meditate.

14:02.443 --> 14:05.244
I got to get my heart rate down.
I'll... Ow! Pull over.

14:05.246 --> 14:07.412
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Pull over!

14:07.414 --> 14:10.282
Zitch dog, Labradoodle
in a Ford Fusion! Ow!

14:10.284 --> 14:11.783
God...

14:11.785 --> 14:13.919
Robin can't have kids?

14:13.921 --> 14:15.621
But you always wanted children.

14:15.623 --> 14:17.556
No, I always <i>liked</i> children.

14:17.558 --> 14:21.226
I've always <i>wanted</i> a Lamborghini
where there's a hot tub inside.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.378
God, I wish that existed.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.264
So no grandkids.

14:26.049 --> 14:27.432
How long have you known
about this?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.468
I found out last fall.

14:29.470 --> 14:31.637
<i>Robin and I had been</i>
<i>hanging out downtown</i>

14:31.639 --> 14:34.323
<i>at this very cool secret bar.</i>

14:34.325 --> 14:37.609
What a lovely place!

14:37.611 --> 14:39.728
Have you ever had
sushi that fresh?

14:39.730 --> 14:42.447
Okay, I am never getting
on a mechanical bull again.

14:43.617 --> 14:46.535
I can't believe Marshall
and Lily missed out.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.071
Promise me,
if you ever have kids,

14:49.073 --> 14:51.039
you'll sometimes get
a babysitter

14:51.041 --> 14:52.857
and come have an epic night.

14:52.859 --> 14:56.495
Oh, and, P.S., bring the
babysitter, she sounds dirty.

14:56.497 --> 14:58.530
Actually, I, uh,
I can't have kids,

14:58.532 --> 15:00.082
so that's not an issue.

15:01.251 --> 15:02.534
Really?

15:02.536 --> 15:03.868
Yeah.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.074

15:12.595 --> 15:15.147
Is it weird
that I'm hugging you like this?

15:15.999 --> 15:19.401
No, it's not weird.

15:22.972 --> 15:26.224
Now it's weird. Mm-hmm.
Yep, the rain makes it weird.

15:26.226 --> 15:29.611
Mom, I'm not marrying
some future possibility

15:29.613 --> 15:31.229
of starting a family.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.498
I'm marrying a girl.

15:34.417 --> 15:37.169
Who means more to me than kids.

15:37.787 --> 15:39.421
Or my career.

15:39.423 --> 15:42.291
Or even the Lambor-cuzzi,
patent pending.

15:43.259 --> 15:45.510
So please...

15:46.346 --> 15:47.629
...be nice to her?

15:50.166 --> 15:52.668
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

15:52.670 --> 15:54.202
Get out there
and drag Clint's

15:54.204 --> 15:57.306
downward-facing ass back in here
so we can get going.

15:57.308 --> 15:59.891
Just let him do his thing.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.928
Do you know why
the Daphnes of the world

16:03.930 --> 16:05.530
always get to pick the music

16:05.532 --> 16:07.816
and the Marshalls pay
all the tolls?

16:07.818 --> 16:08.817
Because
the Marshalls

16:08.819 --> 16:10.619
are so concerned

16:10.621 --> 16:12.704
with letting everybody
do their thing,

16:12.706 --> 16:15.940
and the Daphnes
are taking care of Daphne.

16:15.942 --> 16:19.711
You can talk to me about solar
or wind or hydro-whatever,

16:19.713 --> 16:22.447
but the world is always gonna
push you around, Marshall.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.050
Until you learn
to go nuclear.

16:30.307 --> 16:31.947
What are you doing?

16:34.177 --> 16:35.844
Is this real?

16:35.846 --> 16:37.229
Are you doing this?

16:38.514 --> 16:39.848
We need some driving music.

16:39.850 --> 16:40.350
No!

16:44.971 --> 16:48.073
You threw a live grenade
into my marriage.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.660
You screwed up my whole world.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.746
So from now on...

16:54.748 --> 16:57.649
we listen to my music.

16:58.618 --> 17:02.153
♪ But I would walk 500 miles

17:02.155 --> 17:04.489
♪ And I would walk 500 more...

17:04.491 --> 17:06.258
I hate this song.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.709
Give it time.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.348
Zitch dog, beagle
in a Beetle.

17:13.349 --> 17:15.884
Don't let Loretta
get to you.

17:15.886 --> 17:19.186
Hey, when your mom gets here,
do you want to all go--

17:19.189 --> 17:22.858
I don't know--
avoid jellyfish?

17:22.859 --> 17:23.724
She's not coming.

17:23.727 --> 17:25.277
What?

17:25.279 --> 17:26.978
I finally got a hold of her.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.013
She, um, never got on the plane.

17:29.015 --> 17:30.565
She was too scared.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.151
She won't be
at her daughter's wedding.

17:40.294 --> 17:42.461
If that is the case...

17:42.463 --> 17:45.914
can we tell Barney
she's super fat?

17:45.916 --> 17:48.083
It would mean the world to me.

17:49.253 --> 17:50.802
Of course.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.221
Oh, here we go.

17:53.223 --> 17:54.589
Listen, Robin...
Loretta,

17:54.591 --> 17:57.041
not now. Robin just found out

17:57.043 --> 17:58.710
her mom's not coming
to the wedding.

18:02.648 --> 18:03.882
Oh.

18:03.884 --> 18:05.784
Well, uh, okay.

18:05.786 --> 18:07.002
Loretta...

18:07.004 --> 18:08.270
My name's Mom.

18:08.272 --> 18:10.388
Don't you ever call me
anything else.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.606
I'm Mom.

18:11.608 --> 18:13.892
Okay.

18:13.894 --> 18:15.093
Mom.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.329
I'm sorry.
Sometimes I get...

18:18.831 --> 18:20.499
...carried away.

18:23.252 --> 18:27.122
Your eggs are great, by the way.

18:27.124 --> 18:28.740
<i>Oh, mama,</i>

18:28.742 --> 18:30.509
that was some bad advice.

18:30.511 --> 18:31.760
Thanks, Lil.

18:32.428 --> 18:33.244
But you know what sucks?

18:33.246 --> 18:34.463
When I was
at the top

18:34.465 --> 18:35.630
of that lighthouse,

18:35.632 --> 18:37.432
despite everything else...

18:37.434 --> 18:40.385
Wow. It's like traveling
back in time.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.521
Just stop talking.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.307
<i>...it was breathtaking.</i>

18:45.309 --> 18:47.592
And I wasted it.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.611
I mean, how many places
have I ruined forever

18:49.613 --> 18:51.530
by being there
with the wrong girl?

18:51.532 --> 18:53.899
So come back
with the right girl.

18:53.901 --> 18:55.784
I don't know.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.069
I'm starting to think a person
gets a certain allotment

18:58.071 --> 19:00.772
of lighthouses per lifetime.

19:00.774 --> 19:03.041
And I've used all mine up.

19:03.043 --> 19:05.877
<i>And that, kids, is the kind</i>
<i>of stupid thing you say</i>

19:05.879 --> 19:08.112
<i>before you've met the person</i>
<i>who hits the reset button</i>

19:08.114 --> 19:10.665
<i>on the world,</i>
<i>who makes everything new again,</i>

19:10.667 --> 19:12.083
<i>who makes it seem ridiculous</i>

19:12.085 --> 19:14.219
<i>that you ever considered</i>
<i>settling,</i>

19:14.221 --> 19:16.671
<i>because not two years later...</i>

19:18.090 --> 19:20.291
Look at that.

19:23.846 --> 19:27.015
It's like traveling
back in time.

19:27.017 --> 19:30.018
That is exactly what I said.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.637
Why couldn't it have been you
here with me two years ago?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.906
That's probably
for the best.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.858
When you vomit, I vomit.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.309
You know that.

19:38.311 --> 19:42.697
Well, thanks for being
here with me now.

19:42.699 --> 19:44.482
Thanks for bringing me.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.821
Wow.

19:49.823 --> 19:53.658
It is just
bonkers beautiful here.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.495
I don't know how you could
improve on a day like this.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.436
Well, I'm gonna try.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.561
Whoa.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.564
Will you...

20:15.566 --> 20:16.481
Yes.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.450
You didn't even let me...

20:18.452 --> 20:19.401
Yes.

20:19.403 --> 20:20.685
Marry me?

20:20.687 --> 20:21.820
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

20:21.822 --> 20:24.739
Yes, yes... yes.

20:27.044 --> 20:31.413
♪ Just try,
try a little tenderness ♪

20:31.415 --> 20:33.798
