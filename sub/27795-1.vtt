03:02.698 --> 03:04.534
Halt!

03:11.806 --> 03:14.543
We claim this land.
It's ours.

03:40.968 --> 03:42.702
You still think that praying
to this dead tree

03:42.704 --> 03:44.606
is going to save you?

03:45.841 --> 03:49.545
You're wrong, savage,
'cause this is our land now.

03:58.586 --> 04:01.490
Do you have any idea what
we've gone through to get here?

04:02.991 --> 04:05.991
I lost my wife and son

04:05.993 --> 04:08.595
in a rockslide crossing
the Monongahela.

04:08.597 --> 04:11.631
I lost everything to get here!

04:11.633 --> 04:13.866
Do you hear me?

04:13.868 --> 04:15.702
This is our land now!

04:15.704 --> 04:18.605
Yeah!

04:18.607 --> 04:23.343
Our land.

04:23.345 --> 04:29.886
Our land!
This is our land!

04:31.620 --> 04:37.923
Man claims to have
what he cannot own.

04:37.925 --> 04:41.860
He places his faith
in fire and death,

04:41.862 --> 04:45.065
where no seed can grow.

04:45.067 --> 04:48.601
But nature is balance,

04:48.603 --> 04:52.639
day and night, fire and water.

04:52.641 --> 04:55.811
You will find balance.

06:07.915 --> 06:09.882
Most people hear
the word "extinct"

06:09.884 --> 06:13.219
and immediately associate it
with dinosaurs,

06:13.221 --> 06:18.026
but it applies to humans
and our cultures as well.

06:19.728 --> 06:22.995
I'm afraid that the
next species to fall victim

06:22.997 --> 06:28.968
to extinction
will be aging professors.

06:30.105 --> 06:34.440
Okay, let's come at this
from a different direction.

06:34.442 --> 06:36.810
The stories surrounding
the Ininkwe people

06:36.812 --> 06:42.449
are those legends, myths,
monsters and folklore.

06:42.451 --> 06:47.219
Some scholars argue the validity
of their very existence,

06:47.221 --> 06:49.122
and that, of course,
is attributed

06:49.124 --> 06:52.257
to the fact that there's
very little evidence

06:52.259 --> 06:55.664
that indicates they ever did.

06:56.865 --> 07:01.834
However, three hours south
of this university

07:01.836 --> 07:05.971
is the place where we believe,
the Ininkwe made home,

07:05.973 --> 07:08.808
and for the past two decades,
I have researched

07:08.810 --> 07:12.848
and studied this area
for signs, evidence.

07:13.749 --> 07:17.216
Have you ever found any?
Evidence, I mean.

07:17.218 --> 07:22.087
Uh, not much.
Materially, anyway.

07:22.089 --> 07:26.091
However, science has given us
some answers...

07:26.093 --> 07:29.495
Answers that have led
to other questions,

07:29.497 --> 07:31.296
but answers nonetheless.

07:31.298 --> 07:34.000
This indigenous tribe

07:34.002 --> 07:40.206
was on the verge of becoming
a flourishing civilization.

07:40.208 --> 07:42.875
They were in many ways advanced

07:42.877 --> 07:48.848
and believed that the land
endorsed their existence,

07:48.850 --> 07:51.851
and they also believed that
their youth

07:51.853 --> 07:54.853
would be replenished by

08:02.163 --> 08:07.199
Which translates
to "magic waters."

08:07.201 --> 08:11.336
Now, unfortunately,
much like the Mayans,

08:11.338 --> 08:14.274
the Ininkwe people
disappeared without a trace,

08:14.276 --> 08:19.144
a whole tribe gone,
almost forgotten.

08:19.146 --> 08:21.046
Scholars have been
arguing a few years

08:21.048 --> 08:23.082
over what could have caused
the disappearance

08:23.084 --> 08:25.887
of yet another
thriving people.

08:28.088 --> 08:32.025
I would like to hear
some of your theories.

08:36.197 --> 08:37.899
What about you, Mike?

08:40.168 --> 08:42.167
Uh, my guess would be aliens.

08:43.938 --> 08:46.171
Well, it's nice to see
you all are still awake.

08:46.173 --> 08:50.576
Uh, actually,
many scholars would argue

08:50.578 --> 08:52.911
that Mike is correct.

08:52.913 --> 08:55.113
Not aliens from
outer space per se,

08:55.115 --> 08:59.118
but foreign invasion,

08:59.120 --> 09:00.920
forced removal.

09:00.922 --> 09:01.923
Mass genocide.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.392
These living waters,

09:07.394 --> 09:10.396
are they anything like
the Fountain of Youth?

09:10.398 --> 09:12.033
It is indeed.

09:13.969 --> 09:15.634
Isn't the Fountain
of Youth bullshit?

09:17.972 --> 09:19.939
Some people think so.

09:19.941 --> 09:21.377
What do you believe, Dr. Grey?

09:24.078 --> 09:27.247
I believe in possibilities.

09:27.249 --> 09:31.117
Okay, that's all I
have for you today.

09:31.119 --> 09:35.825
Try to get through
Calloway by Monday.

09:51.972 --> 09:53.138
Hello, Monica.

09:53.140 --> 09:54.973
Good morning, Walter.

09:54.975 --> 09:56.642
How was your class this morning?

09:56.644 --> 09:58.978
Oh, like any other day,

09:58.980 --> 10:01.079
although I don't think
anyone fell asleep today.

10:01.081 --> 10:03.081
It sounds riveting.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.318
It was.
How are you?

10:05.320 --> 10:06.619
I'm great.

10:06.621 --> 10:10.390
I wanted to let you know that
I may have some good news soon.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.090
Riley called this morning to say

10:12.092 --> 10:14.160
that he found something
interesting in the samples

10:14.162 --> 10:17.030
that you brought
back from site three.

10:17.032 --> 10:19.431
Oh, did he mention what?

10:19.433 --> 10:22.701
Not yet but I'm heading
over to the lab soon.

10:22.703 --> 10:24.436
Well, let's hope
it's something solid.

10:24.438 --> 10:27.009
The days are coming to an end,
we could sure use it.

10:27.676 --> 10:29.975
Have you heard
anything about the grant?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.677
No, still nothing.

10:31.679 --> 10:34.046
Well, don't lose hope.

10:34.048 --> 10:35.315
Never. We're close.

10:35.317 --> 10:37.016
I'm just not sure

10:37.018 --> 10:38.417
how much longer our
funding is gonna hold up.

10:38.419 --> 10:42.021
The board is becoming impatient.

10:42.023 --> 10:43.956
I believe in what we're doing.

10:43.958 --> 10:46.025
I know you do.

10:46.027 --> 10:47.897
How is Alan?

10:49.431 --> 10:52.699
Alan is...

10:52.701 --> 10:54.470
fine, I'm sure.

10:55.736 --> 10:59.171
There must be a
story in those pauses.

10:59.173 --> 11:03.142
Alan and I decided
to keep things simple.

11:03.144 --> 11:06.445
Ah, I had a feeling
that might be the case.

11:06.447 --> 11:08.281
Not that it's any
of my business,

11:08.283 --> 11:11.117
but don't wait until
you become my age

11:11.119 --> 11:14.219
before realizing
what could have been.

11:14.221 --> 11:16.324
I know real when I see it.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.492
I'll keep that in mind.

11:19.494 --> 11:23.363
Do let me know what
Riley discovered in the lab.

11:23.365 --> 11:24.363
Will do.

11:24.365 --> 11:25.330
Okay, take care.

11:25.332 --> 11:26.534
Bye, Walter.

12:00.802 --> 12:03.335
Riley, how is this happening?

12:03.337 --> 12:05.037
I have no idea.

12:05.039 --> 12:06.372
Are these all from
the same sample?

12:06.374 --> 12:08.440
Yes, 3D7.

12:08.442 --> 12:10.243
It's one of the samples
Dr. Grey brought back

12:10.245 --> 12:12.145
from his expedition
in the forest.

12:12.147 --> 12:14.079
But even if they were from
different samples, Monica,

12:14.081 --> 12:15.348
the molecules would average out.

12:15.350 --> 12:19.252
They would all reach one pH and
that would be relatively stable.

12:19.254 --> 12:20.186
Where did it finish up?

12:20.188 --> 12:22.789
The most acidic reading
I got was 2.71,

12:22.791 --> 12:26.425
and the most basic was 15.66.

12:26.427 --> 12:27.392
But that's...

12:27.394 --> 12:29.130
Impossible, I know.

12:30.432 --> 12:33.266
Okay, well what impurities
did you find in the sample?

12:33.268 --> 12:36.401
That's the other thing, not one.

12:36.403 --> 12:38.570
It's pure H2O,
chemically speaking at least.

12:38.572 --> 12:41.807
No bacteria, no algae,
no particulates of any kind.

12:41.809 --> 12:43.378
It's remarkable really.

12:44.578 --> 12:49.181
Not only is it remarkable, it's
impossible,

12:49.183 --> 12:50.816
chemically at least.

12:50.818 --> 12:53.352
I mean, coming from a
source out in the woods,

12:53.354 --> 12:55.287
all of the other
collections were

12:55.289 --> 12:56.622
their own little ecosystems.

12:56.624 --> 12:58.391
What about the
other samples in the lot?

12:58.393 --> 13:01.463
Only 3D7 reacted this way.

13:02.263 --> 13:04.363
We have to tell
Dr. Grey about this.

13:04.365 --> 13:08.434
He may have actually
found his legendary Ininkwe,

13:08.436 --> 13:10.236
Fountain of Youth.

13:10.238 --> 13:12.839
So, we are in possession

13:12.841 --> 13:17.343
of 60 milliliters of magic

13:17.345 --> 13:19.377
lightning in a bottle?

13:19.379 --> 13:23.849
Wherever he got this sample, we
need to duplicate these results.

13:23.851 --> 13:25.584
If we can do that,

13:25.586 --> 13:28.189
it'll change everything
we know about science.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.200
Help me understand your story.

14:07.528 --> 14:09.697
Been at it all night again, huh?

14:10.899 --> 14:12.598
I'm afraid so.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.400
Well, we've got
good news for you.

14:14.402 --> 14:16.234
I could use it.

14:16.236 --> 14:17.270
Come in, come in.

14:17.272 --> 14:18.171
Hi, Walter.

14:18.173 --> 14:19.240
Hi.

14:21.176 --> 14:23.242
Afternoon, Dr. Grey.

14:23.244 --> 14:26.278
She calls me Walter,
you can call me Walter.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.281
I'll try, it just
feels a little weird.

14:29.283 --> 14:30.616
Because I'm old?

14:30.618 --> 14:32.919
No, no, no, no, it's
just because you're...

14:32.921 --> 14:33.719
Old!

14:35.690 --> 14:36.756
It's okay.

14:36.758 --> 14:39.291
I may look old, but
I'm happy because I've done

14:39.293 --> 14:43.362
a much better job of wasting
my youth than you are.

14:43.364 --> 14:45.198
Young Riley, good to see you.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.699
- Hi, Dr. Grey.
- Hello.

14:46.701 --> 14:47.733
Walter, Riley's...

14:47.735 --> 14:50.435
I was just about to make lunch,
who's hungry?

14:50.437 --> 14:51.539
I could eat.

14:52.740 --> 14:55.708
What made you test the pH
of the water in the first place?

14:55.710 --> 14:57.977
Oh, that's just a standard test.

14:57.979 --> 14:59.579
We pop an acidity meter
in every sample

14:59.581 --> 15:00.979
before we put it
under the microscope,

15:00.981 --> 15:03.748
and when the needle
didn't rest on number

15:03.750 --> 15:05.417
but it kept fluctuating,

15:05.419 --> 15:06.953
I thought something
was wrong with the equipment.

15:06.955 --> 15:09.488
I'm so glad
that's not what it was.

15:09.490 --> 15:12.224
We did a litmus test
and then another,

15:12.226 --> 15:14.295
and this is what we found.

15:20.268 --> 15:21.968
Amazing.

15:21.970 --> 15:25.438
Most of the biggest scientific
discoveries happen by accident.

15:25.440 --> 15:26.605
This is no accident.

15:26.607 --> 15:29.007
Look, I'm sure you're all aware

15:29.009 --> 15:32.445
that I go before the university
research board tomorrow

15:32.447 --> 15:35.414
hat in hand to extend
our study grant.

15:35.416 --> 15:38.584
Once they understand the
potential of this discovery,

15:38.586 --> 15:40.685
they can't say no,

15:40.687 --> 15:43.388
because, well,

15:43.390 --> 15:47.392
we've never seen anything
like this Walter, ever.

15:47.394 --> 15:49.597
I just hope they'll listen.

15:54.034 --> 15:55.734
Respectfully,
ladies and gentlemen,

15:55.736 --> 15:57.603
this is a big mistake.

15:57.605 --> 15:59.338
There is new research...

15:59.340 --> 16:01.507
We are sorry to say, Dr. Grey.

16:01.509 --> 16:03.008
We simply do not see the need

16:03.010 --> 16:06.445
for these anthropological
expeditions of yours anymore.

16:06.447 --> 16:08.513
My colleagues
Dr. Williams and Dr. Warner

16:08.515 --> 16:10.049
just yesterday gave me...

16:10.051 --> 16:12.017
Dr. Grey,

16:12.019 --> 16:14.353
you have yet to show
any real improvements

16:14.355 --> 16:16.488
with your research.

16:16.490 --> 16:18.357
We had such high hopes.

16:18.359 --> 16:21.627
Those high hopes are on
the verge of being realized,

16:21.629 --> 16:23.662
if you would just look
at the data.

16:23.664 --> 16:28.566
Too much time has passed,
too much money wasted.

16:28.568 --> 16:33.039
The Ininkwe legends tell of
them harnessing healing water.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.074
This could be a
great find for Humanity.

16:35.076 --> 16:38.279
Our decision stands.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.803
They just do not understand,
do they, Dr. Grey?

17:04.338 --> 17:07.472
Perhaps it's time we
continued our conversation?

17:07.473 --> 17:08.673
Anya Anderson,

17:08.675 --> 17:11.545
Director of Intellectual
Property Acquisition for AESIV.

17:14.848 --> 17:18.386
We're prepared to begin
as soon as you say the word.

18:00.428 --> 18:02.831
Well, that was a waste.

18:31.159 --> 18:35.494
Well, it's not how I
hoped it would happen,

18:35.496 --> 18:40.199
but here's to the
next step forward.

18:40.201 --> 18:43.669
A toast to the Ininkwe,

18:43.671 --> 18:45.603
to finding the secret
of the living water,

18:45.605 --> 18:49.808
to the betterment
of mankind,

18:49.810 --> 18:51.876
to life.

18:51.878 --> 18:54.180
To life.

18:54.182 --> 18:56.614
It feels kind of lame
toasting with soda.

18:56.616 --> 18:59.653
After your next birthday,
we'll blow it out. Promise.

19:01.823 --> 19:05.623
I was approached by
AESIV several years back.

19:05.625 --> 19:11.529
At the time, they were strictly
a biotech pharma concern.

19:11.531 --> 19:14.232
They wanted to fund my
anthropological research

19:14.234 --> 19:18.237
hoping that the legendary
living waters of the Ininkwe

19:18.239 --> 19:19.971
were rich in minerals
that they could make

19:19.973 --> 19:25.643
into cosmetics or tonics
or drugs to fight disease.

19:25.645 --> 19:27.912
This is so exciting.
We're gonna change the world.

19:27.914 --> 19:29.547
You've all signed
your contracts.

19:29.549 --> 19:33.686
So, while we're waiting
for AESIV to set up your lab,

19:33.688 --> 19:36.488
you all are welcome to make
yourselves at home here,

19:36.490 --> 19:39.658
come and go as you please,
"mi casa es su casa".

19:39.660 --> 19:42.026
Are you sure you want to go
back up there by yourself?

19:42.028 --> 19:43.562
I won't be by myself.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.831
I'm meeting a team at AESIV
headquarters

19:45.833 --> 19:48.901
who will escort me to the site
and service my assistance

19:48.903 --> 19:51.836
in gathering more samples
from site 2.

19:51.838 --> 19:54.606
Site 2?

19:54.608 --> 19:56.941
I thought you said
you ruled out site 2.

19:56.943 --> 20:00.278
I have but they don't know that.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.716
I promise I will ditch my
companions and come back

20:03.718 --> 20:08.019
with a nice large sample
from 3D7,

20:08.021 --> 20:12.690
but I'm still feeling out
our friends that I serve.

20:12.692 --> 20:15.861
I mean, we've all been
a team for a while.

20:15.863 --> 20:18.898
I would trust you
three with my life.

20:18.900 --> 20:23.869
AESIV, well,
I'm just being cautious.

20:23.871 --> 20:26.271
AESIV's
last annual report

20:26.273 --> 20:29.007
reveals a very
different company.

20:29.009 --> 20:31.610
They've diversified.

20:31.612 --> 20:35.814
Genetic engineering,
petrochemicals, and avionics.

20:35.816 --> 20:38.616
It seems like nowadays,
if it can be weaponized,

20:38.618 --> 20:40.018
AESIV has little interest.

20:40.020 --> 20:41.353
Weaponized?

20:41.355 --> 20:46.025
I just think we have to be very
sure of what we're dealing with

20:46.027 --> 20:49.728
before we share any of our
findings with our new employers.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.896
I mean, this is like an
amateur athlete getting

20:51.898 --> 20:55.668
a corporate sponsor, and they
want us to succeed, don't they?

20:55.670 --> 20:59.039
Well, of course they do.
The question is why?

21:03.076 --> 21:05.978
In this area,
it goes well below freezing

21:05.980 --> 21:10.015
in the winter, and about
35 degrees Celsius midsummer.

21:10.017 --> 21:11.850
So, I think it's
important to see

21:11.852 --> 21:12.785
if the changes in weather

21:12.787 --> 21:15.754
has any effect on
the rate of pH mutation.

21:15.756 --> 21:17.055
We're gonna need to get
some high-quality

21:17.057 --> 21:17.923
electron microscopes

21:17.925 --> 21:20.058
as soon as we get back to AESIV
labs

21:20.060 --> 21:21.660
so we can see what's
really going on

21:21.662 --> 21:23.128
at the atomic level
with these molecules.

21:24.664 --> 21:27.665
Hey, it's Dr. Grey.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.101
Hello. Monica?

21:29.103 --> 21:31.937
Hi, Walter.
How are you?

21:31.939 --> 21:35.940
The trip is good for the soul,
but hell on my knees.

21:35.942 --> 21:37.942
How are you all?
Settling in?

21:37.944 --> 21:39.711
Yeah, we're all
doing great here.

21:39.713 --> 21:41.814
It's like a study session
back in undergrad.

21:41.816 --> 21:43.148
I'm crunching data,

21:43.150 --> 21:46.352
and Monica and Riley
are planning experiments.

21:46.354 --> 21:47.652
Hi, Dr. Grey!

21:47.654 --> 21:49.822
Well, listen, I can't talk long.

21:49.824 --> 21:52.861
I've got something
extraordinary to show you.

21:55.028 --> 21:57.763
I found this.

21:57.765 --> 22:00.966
Is that what I think it is,
Walter? An intact artifact?

22:00.968 --> 22:02.834
Whole and perfect.

22:02.836 --> 22:04.103
What a find.

22:04.105 --> 22:07.640
I think it's all
coming together,

22:07.642 --> 22:11.809
weird science and our first
solid tangible evidence

22:11.811 --> 22:13.379
of the Ininkwe people.

22:13.381 --> 22:16.382
This totem was described
by the Cherokee,

22:16.384 --> 22:18.116
but we've never found one.

22:18.118 --> 22:19.884
So this links the Living Waters

22:19.886 --> 22:24.055
and the Ininkwe settlements'
as history, not legend.

22:24.057 --> 22:26.959
That's one step closer
to the Fountain of Youth.

22:26.961 --> 22:30.194
We're close
to all of it. You understand?

22:33.733 --> 22:35.035
Walter?

22:37.038 --> 22:41.172
Past the waterfall,
west of the mirror,

22:41.174 --> 22:44.709
beneath where history
becomes legend.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.845
Yes, the weather
seems to be turning bad

22:47.847 --> 22:51.083
on our end here today.

22:51.085 --> 22:53.151
I've already
said too much.

22:53.153 --> 22:55.656
I'll see you
in a couple of days.

22:57.791 --> 22:59.827
Take care.

23:07.701 --> 23:10.936
He found it. He really found it.

23:10.938 --> 23:12.237
I mean, he's got
to be so excited.

23:15.241 --> 23:19.444
Yeah, but did he
look okay to you?

23:19.446 --> 23:24.016
With all this cloak-and-dagger
evasive...

23:24.018 --> 23:26.084
I don't know.

23:26.086 --> 23:28.720
Well, look, you
trust him, right?

23:28.722 --> 23:30.189
Of course, I trust him.

23:30.191 --> 23:34.459
I wouldn't be who or where
I am if it wasn't for Walter.

23:34.461 --> 23:37.999
Well, if you trust him,
trust him.

23:39.165 --> 23:44.469
It just seems like he was
trying to say something else.

23:44.471 --> 23:48.073
What did he mean
by "the mirror?"

23:48.075 --> 23:49.173
I don't know.

23:49.175 --> 23:51.276
I've been trying to figure out
Walter Grey riddles

23:51.278 --> 23:53.211
for 15 years.

23:53.213 --> 23:54.813
He's...

23:54.815 --> 23:56.217
Eccentric?

23:59.185 --> 24:01.990
Let me go see if he left
anything in his office about it.

24:05.859 --> 24:07.027
Alan?

24:10.230 --> 24:12.232
I have a bad feeling.

24:18.071 --> 24:19.973
Did you guys order a pizza?

24:23.911 --> 24:26.812
Can I help you?
Hello.

24:35.556 --> 24:38.524
Dr. Williams,
I'm Anya Anderson,

24:38.526 --> 24:42.230
AESIV's Director of Intellectual
Property Acquisition.

24:44.030 --> 24:47.865
What can we do for you,
Ms. Anderson?

24:47.867 --> 24:49.301
And what's with the entourage?

24:49.303 --> 24:53.005
Oh, that's an AESIV
corporate security detail.

24:53.007 --> 24:54.140
They're highly trained experts

24:54.142 --> 24:58.309
specialized in the protection
of AESIV's personnel.

24:58.311 --> 25:02.014
We don't need a security detail.
We're not in any danger?

25:02.016 --> 25:03.981
No.

25:03.983 --> 25:06.317
Of course you're not.

25:06.319 --> 25:07.952
But just like Dr. Grey,

25:07.954 --> 25:10.021
you'll be going up
to the Ininkwe site,

25:10.023 --> 25:13.926
and it's against AESIV's policy
to travel unattended

25:13.928 --> 25:16.765
with corporate intellectual
property, so...

25:31.111 --> 25:34.046
So, uh, what did
they sort out?

25:34.048 --> 25:36.981
Harris is going to put
Bateman on bus driver duty.

25:36.983 --> 25:38.182
Shit, man, I heard that dude.

25:38.184 --> 25:39.584
I don't want to be a nanny

25:39.586 --> 25:41.152
for these freaking guys,
anyway, you know?

25:41.154 --> 25:43.322
Hell, no!
That's for the new recruits.

25:43.324 --> 25:46.290
Besides, we're taking the
Express route in.

25:46.292 --> 25:47.959
All right, cool.

25:47.961 --> 25:52.930
Now was it me or did I see
you still carrying that assault?

25:52.932 --> 25:54.232
Shit, shut up, man,
what, you still got

25:54.234 --> 25:55.167
your peashooter, or what?

25:55.169 --> 25:56.401
Of course.

25:56.403 --> 25:58.237
Anyway, man, so
how was Thailand?

25:58.239 --> 25:59.337
Puerto Rico.

25:59.339 --> 26:00.605
Shit. Whatever, man.

26:00.607 --> 26:02.975
You probably still chasing the
ladyboys down there too, huh?

26:02.977 --> 26:05.076
Oh, yeah, and they're
asking about you, too.

26:05.078 --> 26:06.815
Shut up, I bet they were.

26:10.416 --> 26:13.619
You three will be
going up to the site tomorrow.

26:13.621 --> 26:15.319
This is Harris.

26:15.321 --> 26:17.421
He's in charge of your detail,

26:17.423 --> 26:21.093
and commanding officer
of your mission.

26:21.095 --> 26:24.028
Febles, Torres.

26:24.030 --> 26:26.230
Nice to meet you all.

26:26.232 --> 26:29.634
Miss Anderson,
with all due respect,

26:29.636 --> 26:32.371
I think this is
a little overkill.

26:32.373 --> 26:36.674
My job is to protect
the company's interests,

26:36.676 --> 26:40.912
its employees, its networks,
its facilities and its finances.

26:40.914 --> 26:42.280
Do you understand that?

26:42.282 --> 26:44.917
Have I made that
absolutely clear to you?

26:44.919 --> 26:48.053
I protect all of the company's
intellectual property,

26:48.055 --> 26:52.224
and I will use whatever
resources I deem necessary.

26:52.226 --> 26:55.427
The detail will guide you to the
site and assist you in gathering

26:55.429 --> 26:58.997
all the necessary information
you find on your excursion.

26:58.999 --> 27:00.998
I am not prepared
to go to the site.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.234
I don't have a
change of clothes,

27:02.236 --> 27:03.468
I don't have tools or anything.

27:03.470 --> 27:05.437
We'll allow you to go home.

27:05.439 --> 27:07.104
You may pack your bag.

27:07.106 --> 27:10.308
The detail will organize
provisions, accommodations.

27:10.310 --> 27:13.478
And you'll meet here
tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock.

27:13.480 --> 27:18.152
Just relax.
Consider it a business trip.

27:36.436 --> 27:39.171
Care to share?

27:39.173 --> 27:41.075
Not really.

27:54.721 --> 27:59.490
Look, Dr. Grey can take care
of himself, all right?

27:59.492 --> 28:02.526
Ms. Anderson said that we
would rendezvous with him

28:02.528 --> 28:06.331
in the field tomorrow, so...

28:06.333 --> 28:08.734
That's what bothers me.

28:08.736 --> 28:10.434
What do you mean?

28:10.436 --> 28:14.206
I don't trust her, any of them.

28:14.208 --> 28:17.209
It doesn't make sense.
Why now?

28:17.211 --> 28:19.012
I'm not following.

28:20.279 --> 28:22.213
If they wanted us in the field,

28:22.215 --> 28:24.749
why didn't they send us
with Walter to begin with?

28:24.751 --> 28:27.219
Why are they sending us now?
What's changed?

28:27.221 --> 28:30.021
Look, I'm sure
they have their reasons.

28:30.023 --> 28:32.490
Their reasons
are what concern me.

28:32.492 --> 28:35.362
I don't think they're
telling us everything.

28:37.230 --> 28:40.367
Okay, what reasons
would they have to lie?

28:44.203 --> 28:45.469
I don't know, Alan.

28:45.471 --> 28:48.539
What could a for-profit company
stand to gain from research

28:48.541 --> 28:51.043
regarding the whereabouts
of the Fountain of Youth?

28:51.045 --> 28:53.045
Point taken.

28:53.047 --> 28:55.780
I mean, are you
not concerned at all

28:55.782 --> 28:58.350
that they just show up here
in the middle of the night

28:58.352 --> 29:01.585
unannounced with an entourage of
bodyguards

29:01.587 --> 29:04.389
and demand that we assist
Walter with the research?

29:04.391 --> 29:06.525
I find it suspicious
that they arrived

29:06.527 --> 29:09.193
immediately after
our conversation with Dr. Grey.

29:09.195 --> 29:10.528
Exactly.

29:10.530 --> 29:13.533
Do you think they're
monitoring our conversations?

29:15.402 --> 29:17.138
I don't know.

29:19.405 --> 29:21.274
You know, Monica this...

29:22.809 --> 29:25.443
This sounds crazy, okay?

29:25.445 --> 29:28.814
We sound like crazy people.

29:28.816 --> 29:30.849
So, you're not worried?

29:30.851 --> 29:33.818
Yes, of course.
I'm a little concerned.

29:33.820 --> 29:36.822
But, I mean, AESIV came in
at the last minute

29:36.824 --> 29:38.222
and saved our research.

29:38.224 --> 29:40.124
And Dr. Grey said it himself,

29:40.126 --> 29:42.259
they want us
to succeed.

29:42.261 --> 29:45.330
And yes, they stand
to gain a lot of money

29:45.332 --> 29:47.099
from our research,

29:47.101 --> 29:51.202
especially, if what we've
discovered turns out to be true.

29:51.204 --> 29:53.572
But don't you think that would
make them want to help us

29:53.574 --> 29:55.407
even more?

29:55.409 --> 29:58.579
Yes, but at what cost?

30:00.847 --> 30:03.215
Look,

30:03.217 --> 30:05.449
we are on the verge

30:05.451 --> 30:11.155
of a very big discovery, okay?

30:11.157 --> 30:15.192
And tomorrow we will
be out in the field

30:15.194 --> 30:19.864
with Dr. Grey making
our dreams into a reality.

30:19.866 --> 30:22.202
You're not even
a little bit excited?

30:24.337 --> 30:26.337
A little.

30:26.339 --> 30:28.241
I knew it.

30:31.444 --> 30:35.615
Alan, we agreed it
would be simpler this way.

30:37.550 --> 30:40.120
I know.

30:42.655 --> 30:45.092
I'm gonna go.

30:49.695 --> 30:50.564
Alan.

30:52.499 --> 30:55.368
I hope you're right about AESIV.

30:57.237 --> 30:59.373
Me too.

31:42.481 --> 31:45.252
Pack it up.
We're on foot from here.

32:09.276 --> 32:10.745
Heads-up.

32:30.696 --> 32:33.297
Beautiful!

32:33.299 --> 32:35.533
I'm sorry, what?

32:35.535 --> 32:41.338
Uh, the forest,
it's all really quite beautiful.

32:41.340 --> 32:45.576
Yeah, it all feels so peaceful.

32:45.578 --> 32:46.611
Smooth.

32:48.347 --> 32:49.480
Shut up.

32:49.482 --> 32:54.018
So, Bateman, what's your
role here besides chauffeur?

32:54.020 --> 32:56.587
It is my job to get you to site.

32:56.589 --> 32:59.324
Ah, so like our very own Sherpa?

32:59.326 --> 33:00.458
Somewhat.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.427
But you can carry your own shit.

33:02.429 --> 33:03.562
Get it.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.462
What exactly do you plan
on finding out here in the field

33:05.464 --> 33:09.366
that would
require your expertise?

33:09.368 --> 33:11.635
Look, when you get to base camp,

33:11.637 --> 33:15.507
just know, there's gonna
be some strong personalities.

33:15.509 --> 33:17.042
They're a bunch of
angry swinging dicks.

33:17.044 --> 33:18.375
Cut the shit, Torres.

33:18.377 --> 33:20.612
What? You know it's true.

33:20.614 --> 33:22.580
Don't be an angry
swinging dick, too, Bateman.

33:22.582 --> 33:23.547
I hear it's contagious.

33:24.851 --> 33:26.718
Nothing is funny to Harris.

33:26.720 --> 33:31.789
No surprises, no failure,
just mission accomplished.

33:31.791 --> 33:35.794
You're much better
dealing with me than him.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.697
I assume Ms. Anderson
won't be joining us.

33:38.699 --> 33:39.664
Affirmative.

33:39.666 --> 33:42.801
That bitch would never
get her shoes dirty.

33:42.803 --> 33:45.536
AESIV's first Team Alpha is
already at base camp

33:45.538 --> 33:46.738
preparing for your arrival.

33:46.740 --> 33:50.074
See? having funding
takes you places.

33:50.076 --> 33:52.610
I'm already happy
to be out of the office.

33:52.612 --> 33:53.844
This is more like it.

33:53.846 --> 33:58.382
Adventure in the great
outdoors, good stuff.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.788
Relax, you've earned this.

35:37.451 --> 35:40.621
Jesus Christ,
what the hell happened here?

35:42.655 --> 35:44.621
Looks like failure.

35:44.623 --> 35:46.526
Yeah.

36:02.708 --> 36:03.974
Hey, we got movement.

36:05.679 --> 36:06.614
North.

36:14.788 --> 36:18.222
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, we got friendlies.

36:18.224 --> 36:19.824
Jesus, Bateman!

36:19.826 --> 36:22.463
I was seriously about
to light you up, big boy.

36:26.967 --> 36:29.733
Hello to you too, Torres.

36:29.735 --> 36:32.970
Not the most
hospitable of welcomes.

36:32.972 --> 36:36.974
Oh, my God.

36:36.976 --> 36:37.941
What the fuck!

36:41.514 --> 36:43.550
What's going on?
Where's Dr. Grey?

36:45.619 --> 36:48.253
We did not find Dr. Grey
amongst the remains.

36:48.255 --> 36:50.954
This appears to
have been an attack.

36:50.956 --> 36:53.691
Boys, we have
a live mission.

36:53.693 --> 36:57.028
Keep the weapons hot,
secure perimeter.

36:57.030 --> 36:59.630
Let's keep our guests safe.

36:59.632 --> 37:01.601
Yes, sir.

37:03.003 --> 37:06.871
Look, we're perfectly capable of
handling this situation

37:06.873 --> 37:10.575
but from here on out,
what I say, you do.

37:10.577 --> 37:14.579
If I say move, you move.

37:14.581 --> 37:18.782
'Cause your life could
very well depend on it.

37:18.784 --> 37:20.587
Copy?

37:25.025 --> 37:29.327
We are here to collect data,
that is our mission.

37:29.329 --> 37:33.764
No, we need to find Dr. Grey.
He could be out there hurt.

37:33.766 --> 37:38.036
We will.

37:38.038 --> 37:42.773
You, stay here and be quiet.

37:42.775 --> 37:46.079
Bateman, I need a sitrep.
Walk with me.

37:48.114 --> 37:53.985
Look, we just need
to do what Harris says.

37:53.987 --> 37:56.621
They're looking out for us.

37:56.623 --> 37:58.525
I'm not so sure about that.

38:01.061 --> 38:04.061
Have Torres take up
her babysitting duties.

38:04.063 --> 38:07.831
Let her and the children
set up base camp.

38:07.833 --> 38:10.001
Two clicks east
of this position.

38:10.003 --> 38:12.070
Collect samples from the bodies.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.972
Understood?

38:13.974 --> 38:17.141
I knew I should have
stayed home today.

38:17.143 --> 38:19.376
Just be positive.

38:19.378 --> 38:21.144
Okay, I'm positive
we're going to die out here.

38:21.146 --> 38:22.780
Let's just stay calm.

38:22.782 --> 38:25.553
I'm sure Bateman
and Harris have a plan.

38:31.391 --> 38:33.825
There's something off
about these bodies.

38:33.827 --> 38:34.962
I agree.

38:47.072 --> 38:49.374
I got what I need, sir.

38:49.376 --> 38:52.844
I want this area cleaned.

38:52.846 --> 38:53.711
Sir?

38:53.713 --> 38:55.880
Evans, Harris wants
this cleaned up.

38:55.882 --> 38:56.784
Let's go.

38:59.385 --> 39:03.854
The, uh, the bodies look
like they've been underwater.

39:03.856 --> 39:08.793
Like they were drowned
before they were torn apart.

39:08.795 --> 39:10.731
What could do that?

39:18.137 --> 39:19.070
Ew!

39:19.072 --> 39:20.204
That's nasty!

39:21.474 --> 39:24.742
Yo, Febles, you got any steaks
for this motherfucker or what?

39:24.744 --> 39:26.744
Oh, man!

39:26.746 --> 39:28.012
Oh, hey, better yet, man,

39:28.014 --> 39:31.749
how about we all
send up some smoke signals?

39:36.789 --> 39:38.690
That's messed up, Evans.

39:38.692 --> 39:40.425
You don't just step
over a dead body, man.

39:40.427 --> 39:41.195
Bad juju.

39:46.065 --> 39:47.634
Hey, Torres...

39:51.103 --> 39:56.643
I'll step wherever I want.

40:04.983 --> 40:08.186
So what? We're just gonna
leave them here?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.253
So much for a proper funeral.

40:10.255 --> 40:13.825
We need to focus on finding
Walter and getting out of here.

40:13.827 --> 40:17.097
This is bad, real bad.

40:27.139 --> 40:31.108
We're here for samples,
not biohazards.

40:31.110 --> 40:33.012
Rally at base camp, move out.

40:34.114 --> 40:36.079
These people have families,

40:36.081 --> 40:38.685
and now no one will ever
know what happened to them.

40:55.934 --> 40:57.802
These bugs
are eating me alive.

40:57.804 --> 40:59.840
I'm a scientist, not a buffet.

41:03.143 --> 41:06.144
I'm not cut out for this.

41:06.146 --> 41:08.512
You got into MIT at 16, Riley.

41:08.514 --> 41:10.046
Surely you can walk a few miles

41:10.048 --> 41:13.184
and donate some blood
to the indigenous life.

41:13.186 --> 41:17.854
Besides we're almost there,
right, Bateman?

41:17.856 --> 41:20.825
Base camp?

41:20.827 --> 41:22.994
About two more clicks.

41:22.996 --> 41:24.862
Whoa!

41:24.864 --> 41:26.032
Do you hear that?

41:36.242 --> 41:38.543
Finally,

41:38.545 --> 41:40.847
something real to study.

41:57.163 --> 42:02.599
Being here in the middle of it
all makes you glad to be alive.

42:02.601 --> 42:04.771
Yeah, it does.

42:12.010 --> 42:14.311
Alan, I think this is the
waterfall

42:14.313 --> 42:16.916
that Walter mentioned
before we lost contact.

42:18.217 --> 42:20.386
Clever, Dr. Grey.

42:23.255 --> 42:26.356
Hey, do you know
where we're at?

42:26.358 --> 42:29.293
My home.

42:29.295 --> 42:33.930
And you will be wise
not to venture any further.

42:33.932 --> 42:35.066
Who are you?

42:35.068 --> 42:40.271
I am Ahanu, and this is
Ininkwe land, first nation.

42:40.273 --> 42:44.909
Hello, Ahanu.
My name is Monica.

42:44.911 --> 42:46.344
There was a storm,

42:46.346 --> 42:50.213
and we're trying to find
our friend Dr. Walter Grey.

42:50.215 --> 42:52.316
Maybe you could
help us find him?

42:52.318 --> 42:55.385
Yeah, he would love to meet you.

42:55.387 --> 43:00.358
You should be mindful of
your path and intentions here.

43:00.360 --> 43:04.662
Respect this land, brothers
and sisters, for your own safety

43:04.664 --> 43:07.267
and do not take
the beauty for granted.

43:08.902 --> 43:11.969
And just like a thorn
protects a rose,

43:11.971 --> 43:15.273
the water spirits protect
the land and the people.

43:15.275 --> 43:18.376
And whoever has
the darkness in their heart,

43:18.378 --> 43:21.381
they will learn
to fear the rain.

43:24.349 --> 43:25.384
My God, did you see that?

43:41.934 --> 43:43.434
He's gone Bateman, not a trace.

43:43.436 --> 43:45.403
There's no place to escape
out here. I don't get it.

43:45.405 --> 43:46.637
That's a first.

43:46.639 --> 43:50.407
Walter has talked about this
for years, but like a legend.

43:50.409 --> 43:52.677
The way he described
the Ininkwe.

43:52.679 --> 43:54.945
We can talk about
the "ink dude" at base camp.

43:54.947 --> 43:56.179
Ininkwe.

43:56.181 --> 43:58.682
Ininkwe. Base camp.

43:58.684 --> 43:59.416
Fine!

43:59.418 --> 44:00.987
Thank you.

45:02.248 --> 45:04.318
You guys aren't
used to taking orders, huh?

45:05.550 --> 45:07.251
You'll get used to it.

45:07.253 --> 45:09.519
After they get used to you
doing what you're told.

45:09.521 --> 45:11.521
We're here to find
our friend and colleague

45:11.523 --> 45:13.292
Dr. Grey.

45:16.028 --> 45:17.461
And I'm here
to help you do that.

45:17.463 --> 45:21.365
Then why are we camping?
We should be out there.

45:21.367 --> 45:23.099
You saw those bodies.

45:23.101 --> 45:24.367
We are looking for him.

45:24.369 --> 45:25.505
We're all the way
out here, right?

45:27.539 --> 45:30.307
Look, we're close, but we're
not gonna find him in the dark.

45:30.309 --> 45:31.478
We're out at first light, okay?

45:33.278 --> 45:34.412
Aah!

45:34.414 --> 45:36.579
Home sweet home, baby.

45:36.581 --> 45:39.349
Man, it'll be nice to take
some of this shit off.

45:39.351 --> 45:42.153
Tell me about it, huh?

45:42.155 --> 45:42.787
Bateman.

45:42.789 --> 45:44.054
Sir?

45:44.056 --> 45:46.456
You check with the civilians,
see if they have any results.

45:46.458 --> 45:50.126
Yes, sir.

45:50.128 --> 45:51.327
Evans, heads up!

45:51.329 --> 45:54.365
Hey! What the fuck, man?

45:54.367 --> 45:55.268
You big ogre.

45:58.204 --> 46:01.304
Sorry to interrupt,
Harris wants answers.

46:01.306 --> 46:03.807
Do you have anything?

46:03.809 --> 46:06.342
It's a negative on the sample
from the waterfall.

46:06.344 --> 46:07.513
Hmm.

46:09.481 --> 46:10.380
Try this.

46:12.552 --> 46:15.119
Harris also wants
eyes in the perimeter.

46:15.121 --> 46:16.253
You know what that means.

46:16.255 --> 46:18.354
You and me, long shot.

46:18.356 --> 46:20.126
You got it.

46:26.833 --> 46:30.467
Letting some lost Indian with
a story take you off target...

46:30.469 --> 46:32.302
Come on, man.

46:32.304 --> 46:35.041
You should know better
than waste my time, Bateman.

46:36.509 --> 46:37.543
Harris!

46:40.179 --> 46:42.579
You address me as "sir."

46:42.581 --> 46:46.286
My mission.
No hocus-pocus.

46:47.853 --> 46:50.556
God damn it. Febles!

46:59.197 --> 47:00.664
Jesus, what the fuck?

47:00.666 --> 47:03.503
I'd really like to be back
at home right now.

47:12.177 --> 47:13.878
That can't be right.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.146
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

47:16.148 --> 47:19.351
But that's not possible,
it's pure water.

47:25.291 --> 47:28.159
Sunshine.

47:28.161 --> 47:30.427
Well, this looks delicious.

47:30.429 --> 47:32.231
Pass it over here
if you don't want it.

47:35.268 --> 47:37.200
Hey, Monica, you want some?

47:37.202 --> 47:39.538
It's actually not that bad
if you don't mind some grit.

47:41.273 --> 47:44.675
Walter knows this earth,
like our bodies,

47:44.677 --> 47:47.478
gives us a sign when it's sick.

47:47.480 --> 47:51.382
Like earthquakes and volcanoes,

47:51.384 --> 47:53.249
hurricanes and tornadoes.

47:53.251 --> 47:54.351
They're signs.

47:54.353 --> 47:55.519
We see them every year,

47:55.521 --> 48:00.356
and every year they grow
in strength and number, right?

48:00.358 --> 48:02.626
Classic liberal
climate change bullshit.

48:04.230 --> 48:06.697
Not bullshit. Fact.

48:06.699 --> 48:10.233
Our impact on this planet
is unsustainable.

48:10.235 --> 48:12.970
The fact is, doctor, that
Ms. Anderson invited you here

48:12.972 --> 48:18.541
to the great American nowhere
to assist us on this mission.

48:18.543 --> 48:21.478
And the fact is, as long
as you do what we say,

48:21.480 --> 48:26.684
you, us, we will be
one big happy AESIV family.

48:26.686 --> 48:29.452
Then we'll see if it's worth the
hassle bringing you out here.

48:29.454 --> 48:32.755
Worth the hassle?
Are you serious?

48:32.757 --> 48:34.992
This is our research.

48:34.994 --> 48:37.427
You are here
to help us find Walter.

48:37.429 --> 48:40.296
And this is my mission.

48:40.298 --> 48:42.298
You'll research the samples
that we provide,

48:42.300 --> 48:44.300
and Tweedle Dee,
Tweedle dickhead,

48:44.302 --> 48:46.704
they will assist,
just like home sweet home.

48:46.706 --> 48:49.572
And yes, together
we will locate Dr. Grey,

48:49.574 --> 48:52.242
but more importantly,
we will locate this alleged

48:52.244 --> 48:55.246
so-called Indian
Fountain of Youth.

48:55.248 --> 48:57.583
That is why we are here.

48:58.784 --> 49:02.286
That is why I am here.

49:02.288 --> 49:06.259
Because where others fail,
I finish.

49:07.460 --> 49:08.528
Are we clear?

49:09.996 --> 49:11.698
As water.

49:36.722 --> 49:38.525
What happened
to those men back there?

49:40.693 --> 49:44.628
The man asked you a question.

49:44.630 --> 49:49.499
The Enuattii is not pleased
with your presence here.

49:49.501 --> 49:51.534
Protector
of the rivers, oceans,

49:51.536 --> 49:55.539
lakes, streams and skies.

49:55.541 --> 49:58.474
This is a powerful place,

49:58.476 --> 50:03.780
and nature has its way
of balancing itself.

50:03.782 --> 50:07.784
Those men, our friend Walter
was with them.

50:07.786 --> 50:09.452
Can you help us?

50:09.454 --> 50:10.787
It seems like something...

50:10.789 --> 50:14.057
Like something
from the black abyss

50:14.059 --> 50:18.795
with a merciless vengeance
to lay them all to waste.

50:18.797 --> 50:21.565
Oh, shit, he's speaking
in riddles, guys.

50:21.567 --> 50:24.534
This is where we all began,

50:24.536 --> 50:28.072
from the water,
the trees and the rocks.

50:28.074 --> 50:30.807
Enough of this hippie
bullshit, chief.

50:30.809 --> 50:34.811
You think you can
challenge the laws of nature?

50:34.813 --> 50:38.349
Nature's law has no mercy.

50:38.351 --> 50:40.818
What does that even mean?

50:40.820 --> 50:42.289
It means the end.

50:43.722 --> 50:45.822
Your end.

50:45.824 --> 50:47.090
Is that a threat?

50:47.092 --> 50:49.827
There will be
more than rain coming!

50:49.829 --> 50:51.829
I want answers.

51:05.577 --> 51:06.846
Nothing.

51:09.414 --> 51:10.717
He's gone, sir.

51:12.550 --> 51:15.719
We do not listen to
a word this Indian says.

51:15.721 --> 51:19.123
We need to get
our shit together.

51:19.125 --> 51:21.458
We are not living in
a Native American fable.

51:21.460 --> 51:22.892
We're in the real world,
and in the real world,

51:22.894 --> 51:26.729
he is gone out there
with whoever did this.

51:26.731 --> 51:28.865
Or whatever.

51:28.867 --> 51:30.804
This is a set up.

51:37.742 --> 51:39.610
And that the same thing that
happened before

51:39.612 --> 51:40.844
would happen to us.

51:40.846 --> 51:43.713
Either way, Harris,
we need to find Walter.

51:43.715 --> 51:44.782
And I think I have.

51:44.784 --> 51:47.617
Walter mentioned
something about a mirror,

51:47.619 --> 51:49.887
and I think it's
in reference to a lake

51:49.889 --> 51:53.824
beyond this waterfall,
near the cave, east from here.

51:53.826 --> 51:54.894
Evans.

51:57.963 --> 51:59.530
Check your readings.

51:59.532 --> 52:00.963
See if there is anything pinging

52:00.965 --> 52:02.865
two clicks east
of this position.

52:02.867 --> 52:05.501
Bateman.

52:05.503 --> 52:09.639
Sir?

52:09.641 --> 52:10.907
Resume babysitting duty.

52:10.909 --> 52:14.510
See if there's anything useful
you can get out of these two.

52:14.512 --> 52:15.612
Yes, sir.

52:15.614 --> 52:16.713
I'll go check this out.

52:16.715 --> 52:17.313
What?

52:17.315 --> 52:19.615
No we're coming with you.

52:19.617 --> 52:22.889
You will do exactly as I say!

52:24.623 --> 52:26.592
You got that?

52:29.527 --> 52:30.427
You!

52:30.429 --> 52:33.500
You're coming with us
gathering samples.

52:37.536 --> 52:39.903
Dang, dude, do you ever
change clothes or what?

52:39.905 --> 52:42.539
Einstein wore the
same outfit every day.

52:42.541 --> 52:46.677
I have seven of these,
and this one is Tuesday's.

52:46.679 --> 52:49.646
Careful, your nerd is showing.

52:49.648 --> 52:51.882
Alpha Team, load up.

52:51.884 --> 52:53.452
Yes, sir.

52:54.719 --> 52:58.822
Torres, on me.

52:58.824 --> 53:02.959
Torres, watch
your ass out there.

53:02.961 --> 53:04.463
You watch it.

53:07.699 --> 53:09.768
Take us there, Febles.

53:21.880 --> 53:22.845
Febles!

53:22.847 --> 53:24.548
Sir?

53:24.550 --> 53:25.816
No.

53:25.818 --> 53:27.554
Roger that.

53:28.853 --> 53:30.923
Thank God.

53:37.929 --> 53:41.764
Whoa!
What is this place?

53:41.766 --> 53:44.735
Evans, Torres,
secure this position.

53:44.737 --> 53:46.072
Sir.

53:47.706 --> 53:48.539
Febles.

53:48.541 --> 53:49.639
Sir?

53:49.641 --> 53:52.811
Please escort Riley to
the cave and gather samples.

54:20.039 --> 54:22.639
You hear that?

54:22.641 --> 54:24.074
Yeah, so?

54:24.076 --> 54:27.644
So, Harris said to get samples.

54:27.646 --> 54:29.646
It's the sound of water.

54:29.648 --> 54:31.782
It sounds close.

54:31.784 --> 54:34.753
This will be an excellent
source, clean and pure.

54:36.722 --> 54:38.658
Whatever you say, man.

55:01.813 --> 55:06.682
The elusive Dr. Grey.

55:06.684 --> 55:09.720
Not looking so good, are we?

55:09.722 --> 55:13.824
I thought I'd just lie here
in the sun for a while.

55:13.826 --> 55:14.791
That's great.

55:14.793 --> 55:17.026
Look, I believe you
have something for me.

55:17.028 --> 55:20.630
Something your assistants
say, what is it,

55:20.632 --> 55:23.066
lasts forever?

55:23.068 --> 55:27.970
Well, Dr. Grey, maybe
I could last forever too.

55:44.690 --> 55:47.157
It was your idea
to come back here,

55:47.159 --> 55:48.425
now you're afraid of the dark?

55:48.427 --> 55:50.394
It's not what I said.

55:50.396 --> 55:52.896
I said it seems darker here.

55:58.103 --> 56:00.106
You may be right.

56:02.875 --> 56:04.407
You didn't think I'd
actually let you and your team

56:04.409 --> 56:06.612
get out of here alive, did you?

56:07.846 --> 56:09.916
Leave them be.

56:12.684 --> 56:15.052
Good move.

56:15.054 --> 56:17.753
I knew they'd send
another thief, an assassin

56:17.755 --> 56:19.958
to finish the job
the first two couldn't.

56:28.233 --> 56:30.833
I was holding it
when the dumbass shot me.

56:42.880 --> 56:44.916
Watch it!

56:47.119 --> 56:48.818
Let's go.

56:48.820 --> 56:50.789
Now!

57:02.134 --> 57:04.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Riley, calm down.

57:04.503 --> 57:05.869
You heard that.

57:05.871 --> 57:07.269
There's something
in here with us.

57:07.271 --> 57:08.838
Give me that
before you hurt yourself.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.474
There is something
in here with us.

57:11.476 --> 57:14.276
They deserved
what happened to them.

57:14.278 --> 57:17.113
All of you criminals deserve

57:17.115 --> 57:18.918
what it's going
to happen to you.

57:20.853 --> 57:22.251
It knows.

57:33.865 --> 57:35.865
Bateman, come in.

57:35.867 --> 57:37.501
Go for Bateman.

57:37.503 --> 57:41.003
Tell Dr. Warner and Dr. Williams
I found their friend.

57:43.175 --> 57:46.846
Unfortunately,
he didn't make it.

57:53.885 --> 57:55.688
Oh, Walter.

58:07.331 --> 58:09.900
Riley, man!
What the hell?

58:09.902 --> 58:12.536
Riley, quit it man.

58:12.538 --> 58:15.005
Riley, give me the gun!

58:30.322 --> 58:33.356
You fool.

58:33.358 --> 58:35.961
The Enuattii...

58:39.030 --> 58:41.097
What did you say, dead man?

58:43.302 --> 58:47.269
You brought it upon yourself.

58:47.271 --> 58:50.941
You will know balance.

59:33.918 --> 59:35.954
I'm sorry
for your loss.

59:37.088 --> 59:39.324
He was a kind man.

59:41.159 --> 59:45.161
He knew that turning
to AESIV would have a cost.

59:45.163 --> 59:47.833
He just didn't know
it'd be his life.

59:51.369 --> 59:54.104
Looks like rain.

59:54.106 --> 59:56.108
There will be more than rain.

59:58.242 --> 59:59.943
You and your AESIV war machine

59:59.945 --> 01:00:02.945
have no business here
doing what you're doing.

01:00:02.947 --> 01:00:05.382
We are not all the same.

01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:08.284
I'm a person with
a job just like you.

01:00:08.286 --> 01:00:12.188
Look, Torres and I,
we have history, trust.

01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:15.191
Just like you, Alan...

01:00:16.295 --> 01:00:17.994
and Dr. Grey.

01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:22.001
AESIV assigned Torres
and I under Harris's command.

01:00:25.469 --> 01:00:28.240
We're all trespassers here.

01:00:52.164 --> 01:00:53.963
Bateman, come in.

01:00:53.965 --> 01:00:56.066
Go for Bateman.

01:00:56.068 --> 01:01:00.103
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a sitrep on the weather ASAP.

01:01:00.105 --> 01:01:02.037
I have what I came for.

01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:03.440
Mission accomplished.

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:05.708
Have our guests
verify the samples.

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:08.711
I feel
Ms. Anderson shall be pleased.

01:01:11.382 --> 01:01:13.349
Base camp to Harris. Repeat.

01:01:20.092 --> 01:01:23.193
Bateman.

01:01:23.195 --> 01:01:26.262
Bateman, come in. Over.

01:01:35.072 --> 01:01:36.039
Oh, my God.

01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:44.014
Febles! Back!

01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:49.753
Hey, hey, what the hell
was that?

01:01:52.123 --> 01:01:54.057
Yo, Feb.

01:01:54.059 --> 01:01:56.126
Feb, what the fuck, man?

01:01:56.128 --> 01:01:57.793
Febles, what's up?

01:01:57.795 --> 01:02:01.197
Yo, hey, calm down, man.

01:02:01.199 --> 01:02:02.465
It was like everywhere, man!

01:02:02.467 --> 01:02:05.267
What?
What was everywhere?

01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:07.403
Where is Riley?

01:02:07.405 --> 01:02:09.104
Gone, sir.

01:02:09.106 --> 01:02:10.440
Gone?

01:02:10.442 --> 01:02:13.309
What do you mean gone?

01:02:13.311 --> 01:02:17.780
It's like... It's like
the water came alive.

01:02:17.782 --> 01:02:20.550
It looked like it pulled
the life right out of him.

01:02:20.552 --> 01:02:22.519
Evans, did you get
a reading on this?

01:02:22.521 --> 01:02:24.153
Uh, standby, sir.

01:02:24.155 --> 01:02:25.789
Electronics are dead.

01:02:25.791 --> 01:02:28.490
Whatever it was, shot
all our gear down like an EMP.

01:02:28.492 --> 01:02:30.293
She's right. Comms are dead.

01:02:30.295 --> 01:02:33.262
We can't even use our comms now?
Fucking unreal, man!

01:02:33.264 --> 01:02:35.365
Enough!

01:02:35.367 --> 01:02:40.439
Base camp,
weapons hot, eyes open.

01:02:46.143 --> 01:02:48.244
You coming, sweetheart?

01:02:48.246 --> 01:02:50.246
Yeah, man.

01:03:00.092 --> 01:03:03.325
What can you tell me, doctors?
Give me something.

01:03:03.327 --> 01:03:05.595
First, you tell me
what Harris meant.

01:03:05.597 --> 01:03:07.630
"Mission accomplished"?

01:03:07.632 --> 01:03:10.166
What exactly did
Harris come here to do?

01:03:10.168 --> 01:03:12.434
Look, we're not all the same.

01:03:12.436 --> 01:03:16.338
Let me help, so we can wrap this
up and we can go home, okay?

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.606
What is going on
with these readings?

01:03:17.608 --> 01:03:20.309
I've never seen
anything like this.

01:03:22.246 --> 01:03:23.378
What the hell?

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.148
It's only getting worse,
a lot worse.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.550
I mean, look at the map.

01:03:52.878 --> 01:03:53.675
Evans!

01:03:53.677 --> 01:03:55.345
Yes, sir.

01:03:55.347 --> 01:03:57.412
Out point.

01:03:57.414 --> 01:03:59.217
Move out.

01:04:10.327 --> 01:04:16.331
- What?
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing here?

01:04:16.333 --> 01:04:17.669
Why have we stopped?

01:04:23.275 --> 01:04:24.541
Oh, shit!

01:04:43.295 --> 01:04:44.329
What the hell was that?

01:04:46.965 --> 01:04:50.233
Come on, show yourself,
you coward.

01:04:50.235 --> 01:04:51.333
Evans, wait!

01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:52.469
What?

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:55.371
It's just one man running around
out there in the rain.

01:04:55.373 --> 01:04:57.143
Where the fuck is he?

01:05:05.717 --> 01:05:06.648
Where'd he go?

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:14.389
Hey!

01:05:15.693 --> 01:05:16.458
Help!

01:05:21.298 --> 01:05:22.300
No!

01:05:25.369 --> 01:05:26.336
Help me!

01:05:44.255 --> 01:05:46.424
Base camp, on me, now!

01:06:03.675 --> 01:06:05.708
Did you hear that?

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:08.280
You two, stay here.

01:06:17.422 --> 01:06:20.356
Get that fucking
light out of my face.

01:06:20.358 --> 01:06:21.693
Lower your weapon.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.030
Where's Evans?

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:28.597
Wait, where's Riley?

01:06:28.599 --> 01:06:30.400
What happened to Walter?

01:06:30.402 --> 01:06:32.367
Where are they?

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:33.536
Dead.

01:06:33.538 --> 01:06:36.371
And you'll be dead too if
you don't shut up and listen.

01:06:37.809 --> 01:06:38.541
Go down.

01:06:38.543 --> 01:06:40.575
It's here.

01:06:40.577 --> 01:06:42.845
It must've followed us.

01:06:47.652 --> 01:06:50.720
Alan!

01:06:52.757 --> 01:06:55.525
See what you've done?

01:06:55.527 --> 01:06:57.295
What did he do to anyone?

01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.798
I didn't do that.
That monster did that.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.869
Killed Riley, killed my men.
You do not put this shit on me.

01:07:06.871 --> 01:07:08.871
In fact, you...

01:07:08.873 --> 01:07:10.840
You call this Indian
water demon,

01:07:10.842 --> 01:07:12.809
or I'll stack your body
on top of his.

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:16.582
Harris, she is not the enemy.

01:07:18.682 --> 01:07:21.483
I should've known.

01:07:21.485 --> 01:07:24.487
I put you in charge,
and this is what I get?

01:07:24.489 --> 01:07:25.755
You're questioning my authority?

01:07:25.757 --> 01:07:27.726
You murdered him!

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.827
Your rank means nothing now.

01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:35.733
All he wanted to do was
leave this godforsaken place.

01:07:37.835 --> 01:07:40.603
He was scared.

01:07:40.605 --> 01:07:42.871
Just like you.

01:07:42.873 --> 01:07:46.108
You watch your fucking mouth!

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:47.443
No, Harris.

01:07:47.445 --> 01:07:49.847
Stand down,
or I will put you down.

01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:20.643
I am your commanding officer!

01:08:20.645 --> 01:08:22.144
You're in command?

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.886
Looks like the mission
has defeated you, Harris.

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:36.558
No!

01:09:15.733 --> 01:09:17.232
You hit?

01:09:17.234 --> 01:09:18.935
No. Vest.

01:09:45.497 --> 01:09:46.629
That's the way out.

01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:47.562
Let's do it.

01:09:47.564 --> 01:09:48.263
Let's go.

01:10:01.813 --> 01:10:04.016
Give me something, Febles.
Give me something.

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:09.751
Torres and that bitch-ass
doctor are liabilities.

01:10:09.753 --> 01:10:12.554
Here! They went
over the edge, here.

01:10:12.556 --> 01:10:13.992
Good.

01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:19.695
What's the plan now, sir?

01:10:19.697 --> 01:10:21.667
Well, they
obviously betrayed us.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.601
Hunt them down.

01:10:25.603 --> 01:10:27.972
Kill them all.

01:10:29.673 --> 01:10:31.574
Copy that.

01:10:43.621 --> 01:10:46.722
Shouldn't have left
them there.

01:10:46.724 --> 01:10:48.790
Walter or Alan.

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.927
No one gets left behind.

01:10:50.929 --> 01:10:52.861
We get out alive,
that's the sacrifice

01:10:52.863 --> 01:10:54.996
that they have made for us.

01:10:54.998 --> 01:10:57.700
We get out, we come back
for our fallen in a week,

01:10:57.702 --> 01:10:59.902
get our revenge.

01:10:59.904 --> 01:11:02.641
I am sorry about your friend.

01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:06.511
Bateman was one
of the good guys.

01:11:07.779 --> 01:11:09.778
Look, we have to keep moving.

01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.716
Come on.

01:11:25.697 --> 01:11:27.330
Where the hell have you been?

01:11:31.101 --> 01:11:32.804
What does it want from us?

01:12:01.966 --> 01:12:05.701
Fear is not the path to freedom.

01:12:05.703 --> 01:12:08.004
Do not let it
consume you.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:14.809
Look within for balance,
and you will find peace.

01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:32.928
What just happened?

01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.196
She was a wise and strong one.

01:12:35.198 --> 01:12:37.034
She had an awakening.

01:12:41.972 --> 01:12:45.109
Well, well, well, Febles.
Look at what we have here.

01:12:47.045 --> 01:12:49.411
You thought you could just
compromise my mission

01:12:49.413 --> 01:12:50.849
and run away? No!

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:54.683
AESIV protocol stands.

01:12:54.685 --> 01:12:57.688
This mission
has been compromised.

01:12:58.855 --> 01:13:01.993
Unfortunately for you,
it ends here.

01:13:03.828 --> 01:13:05.193
And you.

01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:10.199
You, this is all your fault.

01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:13.001
Again you desecrate our home.

01:13:13.003 --> 01:13:15.940
You shed your blood on our land.

01:13:16.908 --> 01:13:19.075
This is AESIV's land now.

01:13:22.913 --> 01:13:25.046
The water, ours.

01:13:25.048 --> 01:13:27.215
The profit, ours.

01:13:27.217 --> 01:13:29.184
What's the matter,
they don't have history class

01:13:29.186 --> 01:13:31.454
at the Wigwam?

01:13:31.456 --> 01:13:34.025
It does not end
well for your people.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.762
This land was your land,

01:13:39.764 --> 01:13:44.200
but now this land is our land.

01:13:44.202 --> 01:13:48.073
Harris, you are a pathetic
little racist coward.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:52.210
And you deserve to die.

01:13:57.014 --> 01:13:58.748
Shoot that bitch.

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:00.418
Hell, yeah!

01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:41.927
Come on!

01:15:38.216 --> 01:15:43.052
Thank you, great Enuattii, proud
water spirit and protector.

01:15:43.054 --> 01:15:48.022
The actions of men have once
again brought upon your rage.

01:15:48.024 --> 01:15:50.259
You have judged and laid low

01:15:50.261 --> 01:15:54.095
all those who have meant to
destroy others

01:15:54.097 --> 01:15:56.197
and our sacred land.

01:15:56.199 --> 01:15:58.400
It is time for you
to rest now, my brother.

01:16:05.076 --> 01:16:07.345
Thank you, Ahanu.

01:16:08.345 --> 01:16:09.313
Monica!

01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:40.643
You healed me.

01:16:40.645 --> 01:16:42.044
How?

01:16:42.046 --> 01:16:43.912
The balance.

01:16:43.914 --> 01:16:46.982
Harris was the death
and the darkness,

01:16:46.984 --> 01:16:50.385
but you are
the life and the light.

01:16:50.387 --> 01:16:54.188
One soul leaves,
another soul returns.

01:16:54.190 --> 01:17:00.361
It is and has always been
as I have always been.

01:17:29.025 --> 01:17:30.358
Are you okay?

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.029
I thought Harris shot you.

01:17:33.363 --> 01:17:35.299
He did.

01:17:56.453 --> 01:17:58.286
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:17:58.288 --> 01:18:00.992
Thank you for coming in
at such short notice.

01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:08.030
As you can see, it's time
to move things forward

01:18:08.032 --> 01:18:09.367
to phase three.

01:18:33.524 --> 01:18:35.961
This is our land now!

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.061
Our land.

01:18:39.063 --> 01:18:44.502
Too much time has passed.
Too much money wasted.

01:18:48.038 --> 01:18:51.242
We need to find Dr. Grey,
he could be out there hurt.

01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:55.580
Hello to you,
too, Torres.

01:19:04.788 --> 01:19:07.992
You will do exactly
as I say.

01:19:13.663 --> 01:19:15.367
You fool!

01:19:18.269 --> 01:19:20.201
The Enuattii...

01:19:20.203 --> 01:19:23.604
You think you can
challenge the laws of nature?

01:19:23.606 --> 01:19:26.043
Nature's law
has no mercy.

01:19:40.524 --> 01:19:42.460
Show yourself,
you coward!

01:19:48.364 --> 01:19:50.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Riley, calm down.

01:19:51.569 --> 01:19:53.302
There's something
in here with us.

01:19:53.304 --> 01:19:55.273
Give me that
before you hurt yourself.

01:20:01.177 --> 01:20:03.081
This appears
to have been an attack.

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:07.585
I thought
Harris shot you.

01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.456
He did.

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:17.228
No mercy.

01:20:21.865 --> 01:20:23.635
No mercy.
