WEBVTT

00:02.074 --> 00:03.408
Look at me go,

00:03.409 --> 00:05.575
leading an army of
half-dead zombie warriors

00:05.577 --> 00:06.911
on a quest to save a princess.

00:06.912 --> 00:08.879
Now,<i> that</i> is solid hero stuff.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.115
One of your most heroic scenarios, sir.

00:11.116 --> 00:13.017
- Legendary.
- Totally.

00:13.018 --> 00:14.085
Though you have to admit,

00:14.086 --> 00:15.286
when the flesh hits the road,

00:15.287 --> 00:17.521
it is feeling just a bit challenging,

00:17.522 --> 00:19.090
is it not?

00:19.091 --> 00:21.425
[Growling]

00:21.426 --> 00:24.862
[Groaning]

00:24.863 --> 00:27.898
No, guys. Guys, go around the tree.

00:27.899 --> 00:28.933
Go around.

00:28.934 --> 00:30.735
[Moaning]

00:30.736 --> 00:31.969
I don't know why I bother.

00:31.970 --> 00:33.537
I mean, they're basically
useless, aren't they?

00:33.538 --> 00:35.339
Yeah, pretty much.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.842
Although I have noticed they
are quite drawn to you, sir.

00:37.843 --> 00:39.910
Maybe it's because you were
briefly dead. [Chuckles]

00:39.911 --> 00:42.046
Oh, yes, and why was that, Sid?

00:42.047 --> 00:43.247
Why was I briefly dead?

00:43.248 --> 00:45.549
I told you how bad I feel about that.

00:45.550 --> 00:48.119
- You ever gonna let it go?
- Oh, you mean like

00:48.120 --> 00:49.587
when you let go of the sword
and it flew through the air,

00:49.588 --> 00:52.656
sticking into my chest,
temporarily killing me?

00:54.226 --> 00:57.394
So I'll take that as a "no," then.

00:59.364 --> 01:02.800
Right. We're almost to Valencia.

01:02.801 --> 01:03.834
I'm gonna scout ahead to that castle,

01:03.835 --> 01:05.202
see if it's truly empty.

01:05.203 --> 01:08.339
Wow. Valencia.

01:08.340 --> 01:09.874
Seems like just yesterday,

01:09.875 --> 01:12.576
I was the worst tyrant
this land has ever seen.

01:12.577 --> 01:13.878
That was weird.

01:13.879 --> 01:16.080
Yeah, cuckoo bananas. You
stay here with Roberta.

01:16.081 --> 01:19.950
I think that's a great idea.

01:19.951 --> 01:22.419
Don't you, Richard?

01:23.455 --> 01:25.356
Hey, Galavant, quick
story I want to tell you.

01:25.357 --> 01:27.458
I need your advice.

01:27.459 --> 01:30.561
I really want to kiss Roberta, and stuff,

01:30.562 --> 01:31.662
and I think the timing is right.

01:31.663 --> 01:33.097
But did she say she likes me?

01:33.098 --> 01:34.231
Get to the point.

01:34.232 --> 01:35.299
Do... do I ask her?

01:35.300 --> 01:38.035
Do I just grab her and kiss her?

01:38.036 --> 01:40.137
Sneak up behind her in
dark clothing, shout "boo,"

01:40.138 --> 01:41.272
and kiss her when she's screaming?

01:41.273 --> 01:43.007
What? Look, I would love to help you.

01:43.008 --> 01:45.176
I've sort of got more
important things to do, okay?

01:45.177 --> 01:48.446
But, no, no, definitely
don't do the "boo" version.

01:48.447 --> 01:50.214
It's sort of frowned upon, okay?

01:50.215 --> 01:51.215
I've got to go.

01:51.216 --> 01:53.550
No "boo" version. Good to know.

01:55.587 --> 01:57.321
[Groaning] Look, guys, guys, guys!

01:57.322 --> 01:58.389
Stop! [Groaning stops]

01:58.390 --> 02:01.524
You can't go with me! I'm sneaking.

02:02.928 --> 02:04.962
[Groaning resumes]

02:04.963 --> 02:06.831
No, seriously!

02:06.832 --> 02:09.066
Just... I'm trying to
do a secret castle scout.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.066
- [Groaning stops]
- Just...

02:12.437 --> 02:15.773
- [Groaning resumes]
- Oh, for the love of God.

02:15.774 --> 02:17.808
[Groaning stops]

02:17.809 --> 02:21.378
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Come on.

02:21.379 --> 02:23.613
[Groaning resumes]

02:27.018 --> 02:28.018
So...

02:28.019 --> 02:31.188
Uh, Bobby, I meant to ask you...

02:31.189 --> 02:33.257
Hey, what's your favorite tree?

02:33.258 --> 02:35.426
Because kids these days are all into oaks,

02:35.427 --> 02:36.593
but I like a spruce, and...

02:37.462 --> 02:40.965
Mmm!

02:40.966 --> 02:42.132
Oh, my God.

02:43.802 --> 02:45.068
That was wonderful.

02:48.507 --> 02:49.572
[Roberta laughs]

02:51.376 --> 02:52.510
So, we'll just stand here

02:52.511 --> 02:54.912
and listen to this happen, then, I guess.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.246
[Giggling]

02:56.247 --> 02:58.247

sync and correction by solfieri
www.addic7ed.com

03:01.535 --> 03:04.101
Flag of Truce! Nothing to worry about!

03:04.103 --> 03:06.237
Guaranteed safe passage!

03:06.238 --> 03:08.239
Super poor form to kill us!

03:08.240 --> 03:09.574
Will you stop it?

03:09.575 --> 03:11.309
You're making us look like tools.

03:11.310 --> 03:13.311
We are tools... Tools that will be used

03:13.312 --> 03:16.648
to make the Valencian
swords dull... with murder!

03:16.649 --> 03:18.984
Sorry. When I'm nervous,
my jokes get kind of weird.

03:18.985 --> 03:20.051
We'll be fine.

03:20.052 --> 03:21.753
Sure, we can't beat the Valencians

03:21.754 --> 03:23.188
with my cousin's toy army,

03:23.189 --> 03:25.857
but terms of surrender are
always offered before a battle.

03:25.858 --> 03:27.592
Easy-peasy, pudding and pie.

03:27.593 --> 03:29.694
We're gonna pudding and die.

03:29.695 --> 03:32.162
I'll try and pull it together.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.300
This was such a good idea.

03:35.301 --> 03:37.235
I think getting out of the
castle was great for us,

03:37.236 --> 03:38.503
you know?

03:38.504 --> 03:40.405
There's nothing like a good old war camp.

03:40.406 --> 03:42.340
Fresh air, sounds of nature.

03:42.341 --> 03:44.242
And the promise of getting to kill people.

03:44.243 --> 03:46.678
It just really gives a man
a lift, you know what I mean?

03:46.679 --> 03:49.513
Yeah. It's nice.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.985
- What?
- Hmm?

03:53.986 --> 03:55.754
Flag of Truce?

03:55.755 --> 03:56.755
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

03:56.756 --> 03:58.089
What is <i> she</i> doing here?

03:58.090 --> 04:00.859
She's probably come to
discuss terms of surrender.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.494
I don't want her to
surrender. I want to kill her!

04:06.032 --> 04:08.099
Gareth, Madalena.

04:08.100 --> 04:10.601
Princess. And the fool?

04:12.872 --> 04:14.439
Pbht!

04:14.440 --> 04:15.607
Hmm?

04:15.608 --> 04:17.509
Sorry. It's pretty tense in here.

04:17.510 --> 04:19.611
I thought we might discuss terms,

04:19.612 --> 04:21.579
avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.681
Well, I kind of am here for
the unnecessary bloodshed.

04:23.682 --> 04:25.183
The rules of war dictate that...

04:25.184 --> 04:26.918
God, you're going to be
lame about this, aren't you?

04:26.919 --> 04:29.454
Fine. Here are my terms.

04:29.455 --> 04:30.622
Complete surrender.

04:30.623 --> 04:32.757
Hand over your castle, your gold,

04:32.758 --> 04:34.959
your jewels, your livestock.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.027
I think that's a bit extreme.

04:36.028 --> 04:37.429
Not done.

04:37.430 --> 04:40.832
All the men of fighting age will
be conscripted into our army.

04:40.833 --> 04:44.035
Oh, and I want all the children
to put their toys in a pile.

04:44.036 --> 04:46.071
Then I'm going to light it on fire.

04:46.072 --> 04:48.138
[Laughing] Yay! I'm having fun after all.

04:49.475 --> 04:50.874
If I could have a moment.

04:53.012 --> 04:54.712
These terms are impossible!

04:54.713 --> 04:55.780
What choice do we have?

04:55.781 --> 04:57.015
[Sighs]

04:57.016 --> 04:59.551
You're right.

04:59.552 --> 05:01.719
Your terms are monstrous, but I think...

05:01.720 --> 05:02.786
Oh, and one last thing.

05:04.290 --> 05:06.657
I want you to be my new handmaiden.

05:11.464 --> 05:14.666
Your main duty will be cleaning my crown.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.235
That is not your crown.

05:17.236 --> 05:20.205
That is the official crown
of the Queen of Valencia,

05:20.206 --> 05:22.173
and my mother is its rightful owner.

05:22.174 --> 05:23.741
Settle down, tiny tot.

05:23.742 --> 05:26.010
You're the one who came here to surrender.

05:26.011 --> 05:28.613
You're gonna regret calling me "tiny tot."

05:28.614 --> 05:30.715
Yes! Catfight!

05:30.716 --> 05:31.783

You challenged this giant army to a fight,

07:06.145 --> 07:07.512
and you told them you have the bearer

07:07.513 --> 07:09.047
of the sword of the one true king,

07:09.048 --> 07:10.348
which, I might add, we don't.

07:10.349 --> 07:11.816
No one knows who it is.

07:15.020 --> 07:16.621
You heard Madalena's terms.

07:16.622 --> 07:18.656
We have to fight. And we will win.

07:18.657 --> 07:20.658
How, exactly? Our army has no weapons.

07:20.659 --> 07:21.926
We'll improvise.

07:21.927 --> 07:24.329
Tell the people to gather
anything we can use as weapons.

07:24.330 --> 07:26.464
- And we will make our stand.
- All right.

07:26.465 --> 07:28.132
I just wish you hadn't riled up Madalena.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.767
She seemed really pissed.

07:29.768 --> 07:32.837
Queenie, relax. Everything's fine.

07:32.838 --> 07:34.137
Relax?

07:34.940 --> 07:37.275
If the one true king is really on her side,

07:37.276 --> 07:39.911
that's bad news.

07:39.912 --> 07:42.447
The prophecy says he who
pulls the sword from the stump

07:42.448 --> 07:45.149
will unite the kingdoms
under his glorious rule.

07:45.150 --> 07:48.286
The prophecy's never
wrong. That's just science.

07:48.287 --> 07:49.754
Look, I trained this army.

07:49.755 --> 07:51.155
And they're more than capable

07:51.156 --> 07:54.324
of handling some stupid
king with some fancy sword.

07:55.394 --> 07:57.962
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you should worry.

07:57.963 --> 08:00.798
But luckily, we have a
secret weapon on our side,

08:00.799 --> 08:04.269
and that secret weapon is...

08:04.270 --> 08:05.203
Moi.

08:05.204 --> 08:06.604
- What?
- Prat.

08:06.605 --> 08:09.240
Not only am I the most respected
wedding planner in the land,

08:09.241 --> 08:12.176
I'm also a practitioner of the dark arts.

08:12.177 --> 08:15.847
A master of the D'Dew.

08:15.848 --> 08:17.448
What's that?

08:17.449 --> 08:19.884
"Dark, dark evil way"... The D'Dew.

08:19.885 --> 08:21.686
Shut up, Barry.

08:21.687 --> 08:23.621
But what he said is right.

08:23.622 --> 08:25.690
Why do you call it "the D'Dew"?

08:25.691 --> 08:27.859
Wouldn't it be simpler
just to say "The Dew"?

08:27.860 --> 08:28.860
Good point.

08:28.861 --> 08:31.362
No, no, no. The way isn't just dark.

08:31.363 --> 08:33.830
It's <i> dark</i> dark.

08:35.833 --> 08:40.171
D'Dew is the most powerful
force to ever exist.

08:40.172 --> 08:42.440
With it, you can control events,

08:42.441 --> 08:43.941
bend them to your will,

08:43.942 --> 08:45.909
and turn everything to your favor.

08:47.279 --> 08:50.148
It's also helped me with
my stubborn tummy fat.

08:50.149 --> 08:52.749
So, all we have to do is
eat this, and we have magic?

08:54.553 --> 08:55.987
No, no. Oh, sorry.

08:55.988 --> 08:58.022
Yeah, I see where the confusion lies.

08:58.023 --> 09:00.191
This is cherries jubilee.

09:00.192 --> 09:01.326
Something I was thinking about

09:01.327 --> 09:03.294
for your potential wedding, hmm?

09:03.295 --> 09:04.996
Imagine a darkened hall, hmm?

09:04.997 --> 09:06.130
Hundreds of these coming in at once.

09:06.131 --> 09:07.899
- Oh, wow!
- I'm in.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.468
Yeah... oh, good. Barry, order the bowls.

09:10.469 --> 09:11.768
I meant with D'Dew.

09:12.738 --> 09:13.871
Hold on a minute.

09:13.872 --> 09:15.340
I said I can handle this.

09:15.341 --> 09:18.142
Come on, Gareth. Let's do D'Dew.

09:18.143 --> 09:20.011
Can I have a word with you for a minute?

09:20.012 --> 09:21.111
What? Why?

09:22.781 --> 09:24.749
Look, we've got a good thing going.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.517
Do you want to bring dark magic into this?

09:26.518 --> 09:28.386
I don't know.

09:28.387 --> 09:30.254
A little D'Dew might be exciting.

09:30.255 --> 09:32.422
Spice things up.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.528
- This really bugs you, doesn't it?
- Yes.

09:37.529 --> 09:39.964
And you're sure you can
win the battle without it?

09:39.965 --> 09:40.931
Positive.

09:42.935 --> 09:44.469
Okay.

09:44.470 --> 09:45.736
For you.

09:47.806 --> 09:50.941
Sorry, Mr. Wormwood. No D'Dew.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.150

10:16.913 --> 10:19.381
Well, it looked empty
from the top of the hill.

10:19.382 --> 10:20.915
There's a note.

10:22.152 --> 10:24.987
"Off to invade Hortensia. Back in a jiffy."

10:24.988 --> 10:26.789
Looks like we definitely
have the place to ourselves,

10:26.790 --> 10:27.889

- What's going on with them?
- Don't ask.

I think with these powers,
you'll definitely win the war.

this as our little secret.

14:26.229 --> 14:28.564
and collecting things
we can use as weapons.

and pick out the best bits.

18:54.579 --> 18:57.881
My aunt has a farm across the lonely sea,

18:57.882 --> 18:59.583
in the shadow of mount spinster.

18:59.584 --> 19:01.919
It's so beautiful. Lots of cats.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.521
We can be happy there.

19:04.522 --> 19:07.390
- I can get us one-way tickets, and...
- Bobby.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.994
I have to do this.

19:10.995 --> 19:12.428
I can't let Galavant down.

19:14.132 --> 19:15.631
And I can't watch you die.

19:20.271 --> 19:21.537
So, what are we saying?

19:24.676 --> 19:26.876
I think we're saying goodbye.
