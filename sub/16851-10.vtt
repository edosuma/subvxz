00:01.369 --> 00:03.371
(female narrator)
 Previously on Childrens
 Hospital..

00:03.404 --> 00:05.506
(female #1)
'Excuse me.'

00:05.539 --> 00:06.774
Oh, baby!.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.642
I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

00:08.676 --> 00:11.612
[fast forwarding]

00:24.592 --> 00:26.627
Oh! Okay.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.262
Wow, so many questions.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.298
[theme music]

00:33.601 --> 00:35.403
(female on loudspeaker)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

00:35.436 --> 00:37.605
'Backwards day does not
apply to appendectomies.'

00:37.638 --> 00:39.540
- What do we got?
- Ah, newborn.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.610
Has a wound that won't heal.
Left side above the first rib.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.113
Owen?
What are you doing here?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.548
I work here, Kelly.
What are you doing here?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.783
God! Not the whole
"I'm a doctor" routine again.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.220
You're not smart
enough to be a doctor.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.122
I am a doctor, okay?

00:54.155 --> 00:56.490
I said I'd fix
our baby's wounds at home.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.559
I'm sorry, did you
just say, "our baby?"

00:58.592 --> 01:00.561
Everyone, this is my
secret wife, Kelly.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.196
We've been married two years.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.132
She doesn't believe
I'm a doctor.

01:04.165 --> 01:08.702
You mean a veterinarian,
or a massage therapist, right?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.471
Those aren't doctors, honey.

01:10.504 --> 01:14.342
Let's not do this in front
of my friends, honey.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.809
Oh, wow.

01:15.843 --> 01:19.280
Owen has a secret wife and baby.
How do we not know this?

01:19.313 --> 01:21.215
I guess it's true
what they say

01:21.249 --> 01:23.284
"can't live with them,
can't tell anyone about them."

01:27.355 --> 01:29.490
Okay. Now that-that's
pretty funny, Chet.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.160
But why don't you leave joking
around to the professionals?

01:34.162 --> 01:37.698
Clowns.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.168
Me...to be specific.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.440
I should've
brought her in a lot sooner

01:46.474 --> 01:48.309
but...I just couldn't.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.778
Because retarded people
can't be doctors.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.513
How long's
this been going on?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.348
It came right
after she was born.

01:54.382 --> 01:55.783
It's been getting
bigger every day.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.618
You've been getting bigger
every day.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.787
Aren't you supposed to lose
weight after giving birth?

01:59.820 --> 02:02.823
- I eat very healthily.
- She's a vegetarian.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.293
- Meat is murder.
- Beef, it's what's for dinner.

02:05.326 --> 02:08.362
- Animals are not ours to eat.
- Eat...meat...repeat.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.231
God only created
a few perfect heads.

02:10.264 --> 02:13.401
The rest he covered with hair.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.836
That's how it done, paramedic.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.738
Boom!

02:17.771 --> 02:19.407
Kulap, round up my team.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.909
Meet me
in the conference room.

02:21.942 --> 02:24.345
I'm gonna prove to you
that I'm a doctor.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.449
Oh, Kulap.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.719
It's last minute
but I need a date to a wedding

02:31.752 --> 02:35.256
this weekend because the person
I thought I was going with can't

02:35.289 --> 02:38.326
make it all of a sudden,
because he has a secret wife.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.294
You know I'm not a lesbian,
right?

02:40.328 --> 02:41.962
Oh, yeah. Me neither.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.798
- It's just a friends thing.
- But we are not friends.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.340
- Hi, Chief.
- Ah!

02:52.373 --> 02:54.975
Chet. Oh, you scared me.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.411
I couldn't help but
overhear what you were saying.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.247
I was crouching creepily
behind this cart.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.814
I'll take
this opportunity to invite

03:00.848 --> 03:02.650
myself to the wedding
you're going to.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.418
- I don't--
- You can't say no.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.853
I know you've
asked everybody

03:05.886 --> 03:07.621
and you're in a real jam

03:07.655 --> 03:09.257
and you're afraid
of offending me

03:09.290 --> 03:11.225
and I might also be
dangerous.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.693
[eerie music]

03:12.726 --> 03:14.194
[laughs]

03:16.264 --> 03:17.998
E-e-ew.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.534
Thanks so much for giving
me this scan, Cat.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.002
This headache just
won't go away.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.605
Are you experiencing
any other symptoms?

03:24.638 --> 03:25.806
Is this something?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.775
Hmm. Let me see.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.445
Could be, but let me go check
the results of this scan by Cat.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.415
And you know what?
Yeah, keep an eye on that.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.250
Keep an eye on it. Good.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.724
Okay.
I got you.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.694
Team, I've asked you
all to join me to help me

03:46.727 --> 03:49.763
prove to my a-hole wife that
I am a real doctor

03:49.797 --> 03:52.400
and by extension, save the life
of my newborn daughter

03:52.433 --> 03:53.934
blah, blah, blah.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.036
- Go.
- Could be Bodow Syndrome.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.740
Bodow syndrome. The mysterious
condition of having a wound

03:59.773 --> 04:02.276
that won't heal.
That's a possibility.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.378
Blake, would you
like to join this discussion

04:04.412 --> 04:06.847
or are you just gonna sit
thinking up jokes

04:06.880 --> 04:09.750
because you heard a paramedic
make one and you're jealous.

04:09.783 --> 04:13.887
Um..what do you call a wound
on a cow that won't heal?

04:13.921 --> 04:18.659
- I don't know.
- A moo-o-o-nd.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.628
Hit me.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.963
[thinking]
 This headache
 just won't go away.

04:22.996 --> 04:24.665
Just keep an eye on it.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.067
Scan by Cat.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.070
(male #1)
'Waiting for something?'

04:30.103 --> 04:31.972
Um..

04:32.005 --> 04:35.042
Yeah, I'm actually waiting for
the results of my Cat scan

04:35.075 --> 04:36.910
to see if I've a brain tumor.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.078
That's hilarious.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.613
- What?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.516
I meant to say
that's a coincidence.

04:42.550 --> 04:46.787
- My name is Death.
- Death? Oh, crap!

04:46.820 --> 04:49.790
- You're married?
- I had to keep it secret.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.459
I did it for you.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.694
Now you know why
I can't go.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.663
[crying]
Why didn't you tell me?

04:55.696 --> 04:58.499
Why? You ruined my life.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.001
I gave you everything,
you animal.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.670
Stop it.
Stop it.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.037
Why didn't you--

05:04.071 --> 05:05.506
[moaning]

05:08.008 --> 05:10.611
Oh, you know I can't
stay mad at you, baby.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.446
I can't fight
the power of that

05:12.480 --> 05:14.982
pale, pale, hairless
albino skin.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.051
Oh, but baby, now I'm stuck
going to the wedding with Chet.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.420
Shit!

05:19.453 --> 05:20.688
- Okay, listen to me.
- What?

05:20.721 --> 05:22.122
- You get rid of Chet.
- Okay.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.425
I'll think of something
to tell, Kelly

05:24.458 --> 05:29.029
and we're going to this special,
special wedding together.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.399
Okay. Bye, baby.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.433
- Ah-h-h..
- Ah-h!

05:32.466 --> 05:34.067
Oh, oh, my goodness.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.704
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.039
- Really?
- I just wanted to come here..

05:39.072 --> 05:41.575
- ...take a look at those eyes..
- That's okay.

05:41.609 --> 05:44.845
...so I can match my rose
corsage to them.

05:44.878 --> 05:49.550
Diarrhea brown.
So perfect, just like you.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.588
- Oh, Chet.
- Yeah, baby, what you need?

05:54.622 --> 05:57.391
[grunts]

05:57.425 --> 05:59.860
[gasping]

05:59.893 --> 06:01.695
What?

06:01.729 --> 06:04.665
I'm gonna go
get a tattoo, okay?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.701
Ecstasy? Oh, whatever.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.603
You've been trying
to get out

06:09.637 --> 06:11.405
of this soccer
recital for weeks.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.841
We are on the committee
for carrying the water coolers.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.443
What's really going on?

06:15.476 --> 06:18.479
I'm a board-certified
pediatric surgeon.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.880
You mean
a supermarket bagger?

06:19.913 --> 06:22.616
I have to work
and that's the end of it.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.854
Wait a second.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.790
Are you having an affair?

06:29.823 --> 06:30.891
What?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.125
[laughs]

06:35.228 --> 06:37.030
Also ecstasy?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.732
[dance music]

06:38.766 --> 06:40.000
Ooh, ooh.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.769
Ooh, ooh.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.504
Ooh, ooh.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.538
Ooh, ooh.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.778
So, if I win, my tumor goes
away and I get to live?

06:50.811 --> 06:53.947
Right. And if I win
you come with me.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.583
I haven't even lived.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.618
I haven't done
anything on my bucket list.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.621
What do you wish you'd done that
you never had time for?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.556
I'd probably
go to Dubai or Branson.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.725
I hear, Yakov Smirnoff
has five new jokes.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.027
Did a toxicology scan
on the infant.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.897
Haven't seen a wound that dirty
since I delivered that homeless

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
woman's baby. Going blue,
try and keep up.

07:11.965 --> 07:15.068
We don't have much time. If
gangrene sets in we're too late.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.670
Gangrene?
Better than gang Mexican.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.506
Is that racist?
Tell me the truth.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.941
We need to start the baby
on an I.V.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.576
Kelly's been sedated
so can't breast-feed.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.612
Sedated?
Well, let's all breast-feed.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.047
Would that be rape? Seriously,
tell me, I don't know.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.584
Blake, do you have anything
significant to add here?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.486
Hey, I'm working out
some material, man.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.488
What's eating you?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.124
What did you just say?

07:37.157 --> 07:39.860
- What's eating you?
- Say that again.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.962
- What's eating you?
- One more time, please.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.964
- What's eating you?
- Like Ronald Reagan.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.967
- Well, what's eating you?
- Like a question on Jeopardy.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.902
What is-what's eating you?

07:48.936 --> 07:52.039
- In a racist Chinese accent.
- Oh, what's-a eating-a you?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.274
- Like a sexy young schoolgirl.
- What's eating you?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.510
- One more time, regular.
- What's eating you?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.278
What's up with him?

07:58.311 --> 08:01.582
That's odd, the wound has
shrunken significantly

08:01.615 --> 08:03.283
since the mother was sedated.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.852
Is it connected?

08:04.885 --> 08:05.986
Maybe she's a witch.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.655
Very close.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.525
Switch the W for a B
and add class A murdering to it.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.126
[inhales]

08:13.160 --> 08:15.996
Yup. Baby breath.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.831
My wife has been eating
our child.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.701
Classic Munchausen
by proxy syndrome.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.671
Uh, more like, munch
by proxy syndrome.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.172
[laughs]

08:25.205 --> 08:27.040
Seriously, how's that not funny?

08:27.074 --> 08:29.276
A mother suffering from
acute postpartum depression

08:29.309 --> 08:32.111
will cause an illness
in a child in order to gain

08:32.145 --> 08:34.214
back the attention
she lost to the newborn.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.750
In this case, she was
eating our baby.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.653
Very typical in about
0% of such cases.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.688
Treat it for tetanus
and redress the wound.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.924
Please call the police
and a good divorce lawyer.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.993
- Which one?
- Let's go with Andy this time.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.996
- Which Andy?
- The Jewish one.

08:49.029 --> 08:52.299
- Your move first.
- Okay.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.104
Pawn to king four.
Interesting.

08:59.372 --> 09:03.243
You know, you are very
attractive for a life haver.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.779
Bishop to queen's bishop four.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.781
Adorable.

09:07.815 --> 09:12.285
Perhaps when I beat you
we might work out another

09:12.319 --> 09:15.055
more sex-filled arrangement.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.658
Checkmate.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.226
What the hell?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.895
I can't believe you fell for
the four-move checkmate.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.297
Four-move checkmate?
Oh, man.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.333
I thought you played
this game a lot.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.968
I literally
have played chess

09:28.001 --> 09:30.704
with everyone that's
ever died for millennia.

09:30.738 --> 09:32.973
- So I get to live?
- I need some coffee.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.608
Val.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.010
The results of your
me scan are in.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.379
- You are all clear.
- I know.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.216
- How?
- A friend told me.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.319
- He was sitting right there.
- I'm over here.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.757
- Sorry. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. too.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.325
So, listen.
Have you seen my also ecstasy?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.361
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.797
It looks like I won't
have time to go

09:56.830 --> 09:58.899
to that wedding since
I'm a single parent.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.101
This is just one of those
classic scheduling snafus.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.270
Wait, what wedding?
Oh, right.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.339
Oh, I'm not going to that.
No, I barely know those people.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.743
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.646
Well. I guess
"all's well that ends well."

10:12.680 --> 10:14.782
[all laugh]

10:14.815 --> 10:17.851
No, no, no. I didn't...
I didn't mean that as a joke.

10:17.885 --> 10:20.954
I just meant that as a general
comment to wrap things up.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.723
[all laugh]

10:22.756 --> 10:24.925
(Blake)
'Wait, how was that funny?'

10:24.958 --> 10:26.960
'Look, I don't have
time for this, okay?'

10:26.994 --> 10:30.030
'I have a pharyngectomy
in ten minutes.'

10:30.063 --> 10:31.999
'You think that a pharyngectomy
is funny?'

10:32.032 --> 10:35.168
'I have to remove
a person's entire throat.'

10:35.202 --> 10:37.104
'Due to cancer.'

10:37.137 --> 10:39.206
'And she's a little girl.'

10:39.239 --> 10:41.709
'I'm removing
a little girl's throat'

10:41.742 --> 10:43.443
'because it is ravaged
with cancer.'

10:43.476 --> 10:45.345
[all continue laughing]

10:45.378 --> 10:47.347
'Better write this stuff down.'

10:47.380 --> 10:49.449
(female on loudspeaker)
'Attention, hospital staff.'

10:49.482 --> 10:52.085
'I'd like some feedback
on my voice-over-demo reel.'

10:52.119 --> 10:53.787
'Here's a sample.'

10:53.821 --> 10:55.789
'Attention staff.'
