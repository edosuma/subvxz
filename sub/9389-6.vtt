00:01.502 --> 00:04.922
(SINGING) It seems today that all you see

00:05.005 --> 00:08.175
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.258 --> 00:11.845
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.929 --> 00:14.932
On which we used to rely?

00:15.015 --> 00:18.143
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.227 --> 00:21.438
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do

00:21.522 --> 00:23.190
All the things that make us

00:23.273 --> 00:24.900
Laugh and cry!

00:24.983 --> 00:29.780
He's a family guy!

00:35.994 --> 00:39.373
Griffin, I need you to run these
shipping reports upstairs to the CEO.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.960
Huh. There's nothing fun
or entertaining about that.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.879
Maybe if I walk down the hall
with a wisecracking rabbi.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.090
Do you charge a lot
for your circumcisions?

00:48.173 --> 00:50.175
No, I just keep the tips.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.301
(LAUGHING)

00:51.385 --> 00:53.053
All right, where's the CEO's office?

00:54.555 --> 00:58.517
I've always wanted to see the inside
of the executive bathroom.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.691
-Executive bathroom, sir?
-Yes.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.317
Right this way.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.873
-So where is this executive bathroom?
-There.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.667
(JURASSIC PARK THEME PLAYING)

01:38.473 --> 01:41.852
Welcome to Executive Bathroom Island.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.235
Well, this is peaceful.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.865
Good morning, Lois.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.826
Wow, Peter, since when do you get
so dressed up for work?

01:57.910 --> 02:00.621
Since I got tired of getting nowhere
in this world, Lois.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.707
I have decided to do whatever it takes
to become an executive.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.335
Well, it would certainly be great
if you got a promotion.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.879
You'd earn more money,
get better health insurance...

02:08.962 --> 02:11.173
Lois, I am doing this for the bathroom.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.799
And I'm not giving up on my dream,

02:12.883 --> 02:14.843
like I did with that
indoor hot-air balloon.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.807
PETER: And away we go.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.985
No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:32.069 --> 02:33.529
I can't feel my legs!

-No, wait, there they are.

03:00.764 --> 03:03.100
Boy, it sure is great
to have you back in town, Frank.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.018
Yeah, but this place is dead.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.854
I don't know.
That one guy seemed to like it.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.940
I like everything, including ginger ale.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.193
(HISSING) That's my way
of ordering a ginger ale.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.030
Sorry I can't pay you more, guys,
but business has been bad.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.782
I'm actually looking to sell the joint.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.411
You can't sell this place.
So few clubs play real music anymore.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.621
Well, you wanna buy it?
I'll give you a good deal.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.415
You know, that's not a bad idea.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.625
Yeah, we could really
turn this place around.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.295
Play our cards right, it could be
bigger than the Apollo Theater.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.508
All right, now, next up, we've got
the comedy stylings of Kim Lee Sung!

03:36.592 --> 03:37.926
Give it up!

03:38.010 --> 03:39.219
How you doing tonight?

03:39.303 --> 03:42.306
So you ever notice when two black guy
come in your convenience store

03:42.389 --> 03:44.516
and one go one way
and one go the other way,

03:44.600 --> 03:47.186
what they doing? What they stealing?
Who with me?

03:47.269 --> 03:48.604
(AUDIENCE BOOING)

03:49.313 --> 03:51.690
You stay out my store!
All you stay out my store.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.233
I remember you face.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.322
Peter, I want you to retype those...

03:58.405 --> 04:01.116
Wow. What is this?
Have you been cleaning?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.452
Yep, I'm working extra hard
so you'll promote me.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.120
Well, based on your track record,

04:05.204 --> 04:07.456
you'll understand
if I have trouble believing you.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.626
Believe it, Angela.
I hate being just a cog around here.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.504
Almost as much as I hate homeless people
asking me for money.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.298
-Spare some change?
-Sure.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.010
-You didn't put anything in there.
-Yes, I did.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.848
I put hope in there. Hope.
Don't spend it all in one place, Raggy.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.562
Griffin, what the hell is this?

04:30.646 --> 04:33.190
It's a robot that I built
to save this company money.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.485
Now, before you say anything,
one, it has no human emotions,

04:36.568 --> 04:40.030
and two, its prime directive
is never to harm people.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.115
Oh, God, it's harming people!

04:42.199 --> 04:44.284
ROBOT: Angry! Angry!

04:44.368 --> 04:46.995
Oh, God! It's got human emotions, too!

04:48.121 --> 04:51.875
It's using tools!
It's learning, Angela! It's learning! Run!

04:55.587 --> 04:58.215
-What do you want, Griffin?
-Angela, look out your window.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.510
You see that Anheuser-Busch billboard
next to the children's hospital?

05:01.593 --> 05:03.136
Well, watch this.

05:05.055 --> 05:09.184
Oh, God! Oh, my God, this is horrible.

05:09.268 --> 05:12.145
Oh, God. That's terrible.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.648
Oh, good Lord, save them. Bless their...

05:14.731 --> 05:18.569
Oh, okay. Yeah! There we go.
All right, everything worked out.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.448
Stewie, guess what.

05:23.532 --> 05:27.035
Frank and I just closed a deal
to buy the Quahog Cabana Club.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.955
Oh, wow, Brian, what else are you doing
that's terrible and stupid?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.248
Just wait. In a few weeks,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.542
that club will be the hottest spot
in Quahog.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.210
You're deluding yourself.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.630
You're gonna fail faster than
John Madden's wedding video business.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.010
MADDEN: Boom!
There's your groom over here.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.095
Boom! You got your bride right here.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.598
A lot of people say that Stacy's no good,

05:47.681 --> 05:50.767
and that she's slept with this guy,
and done that guy

05:50.851 --> 05:52.769
and even this guy,
but I'll tell you something,

05:52.853 --> 05:55.522
that experience is gonna work in her favor
late in the game.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.274
You know who had a heck of a wedding?
Brett Favre.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.281
Griffin, I've got good news.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.533
A management-level position
has become available,

06:06.617 --> 06:09.536
and I've seen
that you've been working very hard lately.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.788
I am recommending you for a promotion.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.583
-Will I get to use the executive bathroom?
-Of course.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.253
Holy crap! You know, last week
I ate a fortune cookie that said,

06:18.337 --> 06:21.089
"Obvious lesbian will bring great news."

06:21.465 --> 06:24.384
It also said
a grand piano will fall on me.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.723
Well, good day to you. And I will...

06:30.849 --> 06:33.268
Yeah, I mean, we're... We're done.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.230
Just squeeze by you here.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.779
Is this where I get the poop pass
to use the executive bathroom?

06:43.862 --> 06:45.656
Sit down, Mr. Griffin. We need to talk.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.075
Okay, well, make it fast
'cause I'm starting to crown.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.703
Mr. Griffin, all our executives require
a high school education.

06:51.787 --> 06:54.748
And your file says
that you never passed the third grade.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.793
If you want this promotion, you're going
to have to go back and finish.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.086
Well, that sounds hilarious,

06:59.169 --> 07:01.088
but it also sounds
like it might take a while.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.756
I'm afraid that's your only option.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.552
Well, I mean, if that's what I got to do,
then I guess I...

07:09.054 --> 07:12.558
Next time you get a fortune cookie,
don't open it.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.935
(ACCORDION PLAYING)

07:23.277 --> 07:26.738
-Bye, you guys. Have fun at school.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.532
Oh, Peter, stop pouting.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.869
All you got to do is finish third grade
and you'll get that promotion.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.037
(GROANING) This is gonna be
a bigger pain in the ass

07:34.121 --> 07:36.957
than getting into a last clap contest
with Cleveland.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.335
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
the Quahog Men's Chorus.

07:48.927 --> 07:53.098
Hey, hey, hey. Clap one more time,
you're not coming to my birthday.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.933
-Who did that?
-QUAGMIRE: Giggity.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.899
Good morning, class.
Starting today, we have a new student.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.818
Peter, would you like
to introduce yourself?

08:04.902 --> 08:06.528
Hi. My name's Peter Griffin.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.364
I was actually in third grade
a long time ago,

08:09.448 --> 08:10.574
but I never finished.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.076
Back then,
we had a teacher named Mrs. Wilson.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.787
Except we had
this funny little nickname for her.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.208
We called her Mrs. "Killson"
'cause she had an abortion.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.417
I know, I know, it's kind of silly,

08:20.501 --> 08:22.461
but we were, you know,
we were just a bunch of kids.

08:22.544 --> 08:27.090
-I'm sorry, go ahead, Mrs...
-Wilson. Thank you, Peter.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.010
Why don't you sit over there,
next to Omar?

08:31.136 --> 08:32.804
Omar is our top student,

08:32.888 --> 08:37.476
and we're hoping he'll lead us to victory
next week in the district spelling bee.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.645
What are you doing in our class?
You're old.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.856
-Are you stupid or something?
-Picking on the new kid, huh?

08:42.940 --> 08:45.400
Well, at least my parents
didn't name me Gaymar!

08:45.484 --> 08:46.985
(LAUGHING)

08:47.069 --> 08:50.531
Wow, I never knew you could make fun
of someone for being homosexual.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.033
And by laughing
at other people's sexuality,

08:53.116 --> 08:55.160
somehow I feel better about my own.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.169
Hey, Brian, where are all the people?

09:04.253 --> 09:06.505
They'll be here, Frank.
We just got to give them time.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.299
And wouldn't you know it,
there's our first customer.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.093
I'll entertain him
while we wait for more to arrive.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.429
So thanks for coming.
How you doing tonight?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.348
Good.

09:16.431 --> 09:20.644
-Glad to hear it. Any requests?
-Play On the Dark Side

and the Beaver Brown Band.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.691
Give it up, Brian.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.902
No one wants to go
to a stupid big band club anymore.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.446
You know, I could help you
make some changes around here

09:31.530 --> 09:32.865
that would bring in customers.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.700
You know, Brian,
we should give Stewie a shot.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.870
-It can't hurt.
-Well, what'd you have in mind?

09:37.953 --> 09:40.455
Just trust me, Brian.
I know exactly what to do.

09:40.539 --> 09:41.665
You've got to be aggressive,

09:41.748 --> 09:44.001
even more aggressive
than Michael Jackson's treatment

09:44.084 --> 09:45.752
of his own groin on stage.

10:04.646 --> 10:05.689
Thank you.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.279
All right, Susie, what have you brought in
for show-and-tell?

10:12.362 --> 10:15.699
This is my Malibu Barbie doll
that I got for Christmas this year.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.661
She comes with a hairbrush, a pocketbook
and two different dresses.

10:19.745 --> 10:23.332
Oh, my God. Who the hell cares?

10:23.415 --> 10:26.752
Peter, I would like to remind you
that you are in a classroom.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.086
Not for long.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.257
Can I help you, sir?

10:32.341 --> 10:34.051
Hi there. My name's Glenn Griffin.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.303
I'm here to pick up my son Peter
for a ball game...

10:36.386 --> 10:37.596
Doctor's appointment.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.932
-Peter is your son?
-That is affirmative.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.560
Because you look a lot more
like that child over there.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.270
-Daddy?
-Oh, God!

10:48.774 --> 10:50.734
-Daddy?
-Oh, God!

10:53.946 --> 10:55.405
-Papá?
-Oh, God!

10:57.824 --> 11:00.619
-Hey, there are no kids in here, right?
-Nope. Just me.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.956
Oh, thank God.
You wanna have unprotected sex?

11:04.373 --> 11:05.832
Hmm...

11:05.916 --> 11:06.917
(EXCLAIMING)

11:12.673 --> 11:14.883

11:20.389 --> 11:22.683
What the hell did Stewie do to this place?

11:22.766 --> 11:25.435
Hey, get a load
of Maynard G. Krebs over here.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.479
He's rubbing the records with his hand.

11:27.563 --> 11:30.148
Hey, hey, you're gonna ruin that,
you know.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.192
Hey, hey, there they are!

11:32.276 --> 11:34.069
Stewie, what is all this?
What did you do to the Cabana Club?

11:35.571 --> 11:38.073
We don't call it
the Cabana Club anymore, Frank.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.951
It's now called pLace.
Little "p," big "L."

11:41.034 --> 11:44.454
Congratulations. You two now own
the hottest spot in town.

11:44.538 --> 11:48.292
Wow, that's a lot of people.
I hope we have enough rye.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.418
How'd you pay for all this?

11:49.501 --> 11:52.421
I got a job as a field reporter
for Channel 5 News.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.673
And all the juice
is being collected underneath?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.425
Yes, and whoever collects the most

11:56.508 --> 11:58.677
is gonna win a free weekend
here at the chateau

11:58.760 --> 12:01.180
with international foods
and wine tastings.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.306
Stop!

I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

12:15.235 --> 12:16.528
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

12:16.862 --> 12:19.615
(EXCLAIMING) Oh, gosh,
I hope he's all right.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.825
Well, we'll have to send someone
to make sure that he is.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.583
-Hey, Omar, want a Hertz Donut?
-Okay.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.629
Hurts, don't it? Dumbass.

12:33.712 --> 12:37.257
Wow, he effectively silenced Omar
by hitting him in the face.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.550
My dad hits me.

12:38.634 --> 12:41.386
But I bet if I hit others, the pain stops.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.306
Someday, I'll use what I've learned here
on my wife.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.600
Peter, is this your homework?

12:46.767 --> 12:49.186
Hold on.
Let me take out my reading glasses.

12:51.021 --> 12:52.022
(LAUGHING)

12:52.105 --> 12:54.775
-Yeah, that's mine.
-I could flunk you for this,

12:54.858 --> 12:57.653
but "buttlickers" is
a three-syllable word.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.988
Not even Omar can spell those.

13:00.072 --> 13:03.617
So you're joining him
at next week's district spelling bee.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.663
If you lead our school to victory,
I'll let you pass third grade.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.706
But if you lose, you fail.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.583
I accept that challenge.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.754
-Late '70s Bruce Jenner, take me home.
-Hop on, Peter.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.304
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

13:30.477 --> 13:33.772
So, Brian, how's it feel
to own the coolest club in Quahog?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.941
You think this is cool?
Look at these people.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.111
I'd rather go bankrupt
than cater to pretentious jerks like this.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.614
Whoa, Brian, slow down, man.
We're making money now.

13:42.698 --> 13:46.076
And besides, this place ain't all bad.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.786
Hey, you girls thirsty?

13:47.870 --> 13:50.122
Could I interest you
in a couple of Rob Roys?

13:50.205 --> 13:54.293
-What's a Rob Roy?
-Only the drink of Mr. Peter Lawford.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.752
Who's Peter Lawford?

13:55.836 --> 13:59.798
-What am I hitting on, Lou Costello here?
-Who's Lou Costello?

13:59.882 --> 14:03.135
Sorry, my friend's a little new
to the club scene.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.013
Geez, what the hell's with these broads?

14:06.096 --> 14:08.807
Look at you two. Tuxes in a nightclub?

14:08.891 --> 14:12.060
God, you're more out of place
than Prince was on The Price Is Right.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.938
And what's your bid
on the dining room set, Prince?

14:15.022 --> 14:16.565
-(SOFTLY) $350.
-I'm sorry?

14:16.648 --> 14:19.193
-(SOFTLY) $350.
-Can you speak up, please?

14:19.276 --> 14:20.485
(SOFTLY) $350.

14:20.569 --> 14:26.366
All right. And the actual retail price
of the dining room set is $350.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.534
(SOFTLY) Yay.

14:31.580 --> 14:32.831
(SNORING)

14:32.915 --> 14:35.959
-Peter, wake up!
-Who? What?

14:36.043 --> 14:38.045
Lois. I just had the weirdest dream

14:38.128 --> 14:40.547
that Lewis Black told jokes
that were so funny,

14:40.631 --> 14:42.925
he had to shout them
so everyone could hear.

14:43.008 --> 14:46.011
Peter, you got to stay awake.
The spelling bee's tomorrow!

14:46.094 --> 14:47.721
But, Lois, I'm scared.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.390
There's no way
I can compete against those other kids.

14:50.474 --> 14:53.769
It's like trying to beat schpupel champion
Fjurg Van Der Ploeg

14:53.852 --> 14:55.020
at a game of schpupel.

14:55.521 --> 14:56.980
(CROWD CHEERING)

15:04.863 --> 15:06.114
Schpupel!

15:06.823 --> 15:07.950
(GROANING)

15:08.033 --> 15:11.578
Don't be sad, Peter.
That's why they call it "schpupel."

15:14.498 --> 15:15.832
God, we look like idiots.

15:15.916 --> 15:19.044
Hey, hey, that's more like it!
Where'd you get the threads?

15:19.127 --> 15:20.170
We went to Barney's.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.880
I heard that's where
all the famous people shop

15:21.964 --> 15:23.131
for skinny-leg jeans.

15:24.049 --> 15:27.261
Whoa! These are the tightest,
penis-compressingest,

15:27.344 --> 15:30.764
sperm-killingest, testicle-grippingest
jeans I ever tried on!

15:31.056 --> 15:34.268
Brian, Frank,
meet Dakota and New Bedford.

15:34.351 --> 15:37.521
-Hey, how's it hanging, Dakota?
-What's up, New Bedford?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.648
You look like rappers,
but you're not black,

15:39.731 --> 15:41.942
so that's the perfect amount of danger.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.777
Oh, God. Hey, listen,
you guys get to know each other.

15:43.861 --> 15:46.154
Looks like my doorman
let another gazelle in here.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.951
I'm sorry, but we've been over this
before. We don't serve your kind here.

15:51.034 --> 15:54.204
-You're gonna hear from my lawyer.
-Yeah, you know, I would welcome that.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.665
I would welcome the opportunity
to hear from a lawyer

15:56.748 --> 15:58.125
that represents a gazelle.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.336
-What's his name?
-Yeah, I don't have a lawyer.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.508
And I'll tell you something
about Dean Martin.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.135
He was the only guy on a golf course

16:08.218 --> 16:11.388
who had a five-iron
with a cork on the end of it.

16:13.182 --> 16:16.894
So who wants to come back to the hotel
and take a whack at my genitals?

16:16.977 --> 16:18.270
-Cool!
-Awesome!

16:18.353 --> 16:20.022
All right, we got a ball game.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.900
Hang on, girls.
I'll get you a couple appletinis.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.359
This is going great, Frank.

16:24.443 --> 16:27.863
This club and these clothes,
my God, there's nothing that can stop us.

16:28.363 --> 16:33.243
(SHOUTING) Hey, party people,
I'm ready to get 86ed!

16:33.327 --> 16:35.162
-Andy Dick?
-Oh, no!

16:41.084 --> 16:44.630
-What the hell just happened?
-Andy Dick happened.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.465
As soon as that guy shows up any place,

16:46.548 --> 16:48.800
it gets a worse rap
than John Wilkes Booth.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.552
(LAUGHING)

16:53.222 --> 16:57.518
Stupid hat. Damn it!
I paid 15 cents for this ticket.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.440
-No, he didn't!
-God, could he be any more annoying?

Our next spelling bee contestant
is Omar Maharjarifa...

17:26.421 --> 17:27.881
Something September 11th-y.

17:27.965 --> 17:30.634
All right, Omar, your word is "candy."

17:30.717 --> 17:34.346
Candy. C-A-N-D-Y. Candy.

17:34.429 --> 17:37.808
That's correct.
Our next contestant is Peter Griffin.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.978
Peter, your word is "tree."

17:41.061 --> 17:42.563
Can you use it in a sentence, please?

17:42.646 --> 17:44.815
There is a tree by the lake.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.526
Can you use it in a dirty sentence?

17:47.609 --> 17:50.195
I like to bring transient hookers
to the old oak tree,

17:50.279 --> 17:51.613
where I asphyxiate myself

17:51.697 --> 17:54.533
at the same time I'm watching them
have sex with each other.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.869
-T-R-E-E. Tree.
-Correct.

We're now down
to our final two competitors,

18:03.125 --> 18:05.419
Peter Griffin and Omar North Tower.

18:05.502 --> 18:09.548
Omar, you'll be going first.
Your word is "coagulate."

Ooh! I'm sorry, Omar.
Bet you could spell "box cutter."

18:24.146 --> 18:26.648
All right, Peter,
if you spell your next word correctly,

18:26.732 --> 18:28.692
you win the competition.

18:29.651 --> 18:32.196
Your word is "lesbians."

-Can you use it in a sentence?
-The two lesbians are going shopping.

Can you use it in a dirty sentence?

18:37.701 --> 18:39.995
The two lesbians are going shopping
for double-sided marital aids.

18:41.580 --> 18:42.664
Damn.

18:47.211 --> 18:49.755
Wait. Can you use it
in a libelous sentence?

18:49.838 --> 18:52.758
Gillian Anderson and Helen Hunt
are lesbians.

third grade. I'm ready for my promotion.

Griffin, you blew up
a children's hospital.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.705
-You're going to jail.
-What?

19:23.789 --> 19:26.124
What, you think everyone just forgot
about that?

19:26.208 --> 19:30.003
There was an investigation,
fingerprints, forensic reports.

19:30.087 --> 19:35.217
Nineteen children died, Peter,
and the FBI knows it was you.

19:37.344 --> 19:43.350
Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty
and sentences you to seven days in prison.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.853
You'll be out next Sunday at 9:00.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.904
God, I can't believe
we bought these ridiculous clothes

19:55.988 --> 19:57.656
for a club that didn't even last.

Hey, come on, we had a great 72-hour run,

20:00.617 --> 20:02.619
and in this business
that's all you can ask for.

20:02.703 --> 20:06.790
Besides, I've already opened a new club
that's even more exclusive than this one.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.000
Really? Where is it?

20:08.083 --> 20:11.670
Brian, it's so exclusive
that it doesn't even have a location.

20:11.753 --> 20:16.842
It's in here. Human heart.
I think that's a beat we can all dance to.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.678
Wow. I weirdly feel a lot better.

20:19.761 --> 20:22.973

we sing Stewie some real music?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.266

There's a club that's so exclusive

20:41.742 --> 20:45.037
That the line is 10 miles long

20:45.120 --> 20:48.665
Where the douchebags come to party

20:48.749 --> 20:52.169
And to spend their father's cash

20:52.252 --> 20:55.756
Just to take home slutty women

20:55.839 --> 20:59.301
And then wake up with a rash

20:59.384 --> 21:02.387
Yeah, they wake up
