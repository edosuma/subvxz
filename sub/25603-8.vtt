00:01.392 --> 00:02.393
-Previously on Wynonna Earp:

00:02.437 --> 00:05.005
: This is...

00:05.048 --> 00:06.876
: Bulshar's ring.

00:06.919 --> 00:09.705
A gift. It may protect you
in your upcoming battle.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.229
-I just wanna read the signals.
-I wanna try something.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.362
I need you so bad, it hurts.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.059
Now we're linked together
forever.

00:16.103 --> 00:16.799
No strings.

00:17.756 --> 00:20.063
You are abandoning your family.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.979
Like I'm gonna let a vampire
lecture me on love.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.635
John Henry Holliday,
you're not welcome
in my home anymore.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.034
What you wanna do is aim
right at the placenta stain,

00:34.077 --> 00:37.298
which should drive the seven
ball straight into that corner
pocket-slash-stirrup.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.607
This is why
no one will play with us.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.045
Can you at least pretend
you didn't give birth
on this table?

00:45.088 --> 00:48.222
That's not even
the grossest thing
that's happened on this felt.

00:48.265 --> 00:51.225
-As in, you might want
to lift your chin a bit.
-Mm, okay, yeah.

00:51.268 --> 00:54.315
If only someone had the pull
to talk Doc
into buying a new table.

00:54.358 --> 00:57.535
Hard pass.
Kate's the only one pulling
that ass-chap these days.

00:57.579 --> 01:01.539
Ah. Sorry. That sucks.
Doc's a hard thing to lose.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.628
This is not a lose situation.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.892
This is a "you're welcome
to the moustache thigh burns
if you want him" offer.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.372
Well, actually,
I am, uh, taken,

01:08.416 --> 01:11.288
and my guy only has
a fraction of Doc's PTSD.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.073
How is lil' Christopher Robin?

01:13.116 --> 01:15.249
Still patrolling
the Hundred Asshole Wood?

01:15.292 --> 01:17.686
He's fine.
And I want to keep him that way.

01:17.729 --> 01:21.472
That means I moved things
to an exclusively text-based
relationship for the moment.

01:21.516 --> 01:24.345
Mm. Okay, my advice
is to squeeze all the juice

01:24.388 --> 01:27.478
out of that lemon
while it's still ripe,
before he...

01:27.522 --> 01:31.482
does something stupid
like, you know, become a va...

01:32.875 --> 01:34.833
...vandalizer of... your heart.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.967
Okay. Wow. You're...
you're giving me dating advice?
Really?

01:38.010 --> 01:41.492
Just stuff it, Chetri.
Just call Smokeshow the Bear
and ask him out on a date.

01:41.536 --> 01:46.106
You know, before the world ends,
or... he starts fang-banging
his old wife.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.847
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be an issue for us,
but thank you.

01:48.891 --> 01:51.415
Mm...

01:51.459 --> 01:54.157
think I lost an umbilical cord
around here somewhere.

01:54.201 --> 01:57.029
-Hey, buddy,
give me a whisky? Hey...

02:00.032 --> 02:02.252
Is this about your friend
with the big hose?

02:02.296 --> 02:04.341
-He sent me three texts
and I ghosted him.

02:04.385 --> 02:06.822
-What happened
to squeezing his lemons?
-I dunno.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.347
-Hey, Charlie--

02:10.391 --> 02:13.045
There is something hot
under this table,
and you might wanna--

02:13.089 --> 02:15.700
-Shut up!
-...hose that down
with your big ol' hose!

02:15.744 --> 02:19.226
-No more hose jokes!
-Okay, see ya.
-Wait!

02:19.269 --> 02:22.185
Take this thing and lock it
in a thing inside another thing

02:22.229 --> 02:24.970
so I can just forget about it
and the damn vandalizer!

02:25.014 --> 02:26.450
Good luck hosing the deal!

02:34.023 --> 02:35.459
-So...
-So...

02:37.592 --> 02:38.810
I got your message...

02:40.247 --> 02:42.336
...es.
-Yeah, no, I got yours,
loud and clear.

02:42.379 --> 02:45.643
You said no strings,
and you're really busy
shooting supernatural shit.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.255
Well, not so busy
that I don't have to eat.

02:50.561 --> 02:51.867
And sometimes when I eat,

02:51.910 --> 02:55.175
I like to look at things,
nice things, nice faces.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.570
Dinner?

02:59.614 --> 03:01.616
Yeah, I'd love to do dinner.
I mean, if you're sure.

03:03.270 --> 03:06.186
Did Shorty once cover this
entire thing in pulled pork?

03:06.229 --> 03:08.623
-I don't know.
-Yes.

03:59.282 --> 04:01.153
Do not fail me this time.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.466
Fetch.

04:21.348 --> 04:24.829
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

04:24.873 --> 04:26.701
♪ I know
that ain't no way to live ♪

04:26.744 --> 04:31.880
♪ I told that devil
to take you back ♪

04:31.923 --> 04:35.013
♪ I told that devil

04:35.057 --> 04:37.189
♪ To take you back ♪

04:38.234 --> 04:39.496
Countessa!

04:43.239 --> 04:44.284
Kate!

04:45.328 --> 04:47.461
Bon appétit,darling.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.289
What is this?

04:49.332 --> 04:52.074
A succulent filet
of jackass.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.034
You kidnapped him.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.775
It's a gift.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.473
I know how hard it is
at the start.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.039
So...

05:02.519 --> 05:03.868
Here.

05:09.918 --> 05:13.791
You may have made me what I am,
but that does not make you
my mistress.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.620
I hunt for myself.
I always have.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.666
Find yourself
another occupation.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.321
I am not yours.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.324
You used to be.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.292
-He knows I'm here.

05:39.382 --> 05:43.343
Hey, bitch, I like it kinky,
but... I gotta take a whiz.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.973
What should I wear?
Should I bring crackers?
You know, nuts

06:05.016 --> 06:06.453
None of the above.

06:06.496 --> 06:09.281
-It's just a super-cas' BGD.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.544
-Big gay dinner.
-Ah.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.023
Yeah,
Waverly's a great hostess.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.112
You know, I'm just excited,
you know?

06:14.156 --> 06:16.376
Last time I ate with a group,
some zombie beekeepers

06:16.419 --> 06:18.334
were tossing raw chicken skins
into cages.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.653
Yeah, I wanted to ask:
This whole Earp curse thing...

06:33.915 --> 06:35.699
It's a rumour, right?
Family joke?

06:36.744 --> 06:38.876
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
totally, totally.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.097
Like, uh, um, how those kids
on Party of Five pretended
to be orphans for sympathy.

06:42.140 --> 06:45.013
-They were orphans, Jeremy.
-Spoiler alert!

06:45.056 --> 06:47.537
Hey, so we need to be there
for 7:00 for pre-drinks,

06:47.581 --> 06:49.060
and then we're gonna have
mid-drinks,

06:49.104 --> 06:51.454
and then we're gonna have
post-drinks.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.239
It's gonna be, uh...
well, easy-breezy.

07:01.725 --> 07:02.422
Robin?

07:02.465 --> 07:04.075
Are you still there?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.079
Robin!

07:11.082 --> 07:13.171
Do not panic!
He is still alive.

07:13.215 --> 07:16.044
Hey, you know, Doc,
when we met before,
I didn't see what you are.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.612
Perfect.
He smells like sex tobacco.

07:18.655 --> 07:21.441
What the hell is going on?!
Wait...

07:24.400 --> 07:27.098
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with you?

07:27.142 --> 07:29.884
Holy shit.
You had Kate turn you.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.757
You could've killed him.

07:33.801 --> 07:37.152
He tastes of rancid earth.
Foul. I wonder if he is ill.

07:37.195 --> 07:40.198
No, no, youbit him!
You don't get to decide
who's ill,

07:40.242 --> 07:41.765
even if your name is Doc.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.506
I brought him here

07:43.550 --> 07:46.117
to make it as right as I could
under the circumstances.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.945
If this is you
making things right,

07:49.251 --> 07:50.905
no wonder Wynonna's moving on.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.349
Now so am I. Adiós.

08:02.264 --> 08:05.180
Good. Yeah. Go feed
on someone your own size!

08:10.272 --> 08:11.795
Hey, hey.

08:11.839 --> 08:15.277
Mm. Hey, hey. Hey,
did I miss the big gay dinner?

08:16.147 --> 08:19.237
Tsk. Did that albino squirrel
go all aggro again?

08:19.281 --> 08:21.196
Tsk. Argh.

08:21.239 --> 08:24.678
-We'll have the chicken balls,

08:24.721 --> 08:28.682
the eggs benedict
and the Great Wall
of spaghetti and meatballs.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.031
Namaste.

08:33.556 --> 08:36.820
So this is Purgatory's
finest restaurant?

08:36.864 --> 08:41.651
They have breadsticks and...
knives that look
like tiny swords. Five stars.

08:41.695 --> 08:43.044
Yeah.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.180
So what was it like,
growing up in Purgatory?

08:49.224 --> 08:51.748
I could tell you how shooting
my dad put a damper on things,

08:51.792 --> 08:55.056
but that would probably
put a damper on this fancy feast
we're having too.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.405
Huh.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.541
Basically I don't know
how I thought a dinner date
was a good idea.

09:01.584 --> 09:04.065
Well, you kind of surprised me
with that one, too.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.893
I mean, I was promised
a genuine hot mess.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.982
So far all I see is a smart,
beautiful sass mouth

09:08.025 --> 09:10.332
with some...
some butter on her chin.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.818
Bad shit follows me around
everywhere.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.822
I run into burning buildings.
Willingly.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.867
'K, but I'm kind of like
the Batman.

09:23.911 --> 09:26.478
Okay, but I'm Lego Batman.

09:26.522 --> 09:27.915
Except for being all smooth
down there.

09:30.221 --> 09:33.181
So when it comes
to Fake Hot Mess Wynonna,

09:33.224 --> 09:36.576
all I can say is:
Buckle up, buttercup.

09:37.968 --> 09:40.275
That... didn't sound right.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.849
Will you excuse me
por uno momento?

09:48.892 --> 09:50.851
-Uh, yeah.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.682
What the hell, Jeremy?
You do not interrupt
a girl's bread course!

09:55.725 --> 09:58.293
Okay, Doc is not a vandal,
he's a vampire!

09:59.207 --> 10:00.991
Do you want to know
how I figured that out?

10:01.035 --> 10:02.297
I'm betting
you're gonna tell me.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.864
Because he bit
my maybe/kind-of boyfriend.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.562
I haven't even bitten
my maybe/kind-of boyfriend yet.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.696
-Yeah, he's fine.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.523
He's gonna be fine.
He's not gonna turn.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.528
Plus he was glamoured,
so he thinks he was bitten
by a Caucasian tree rodent.

10:16.572 --> 10:20.707
But... you remember the part
about me wanting to keep him
safe and PTSD

10:21.708 --> 10:23.448
This calls
for a whole lotta wood.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.102
Wait. No...
What are you gonna do?

10:25.146 --> 10:28.018
What I always do: Fix it.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.629
: Yes!

10:29.672 --> 10:31.892
Remember the time you said,
"Buckle up, buttercup"?

10:31.935 --> 10:33.458
Oh, for the record,
I'm the buttercup.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.244
Well, date night has officially
become stake night.

10:36.287 --> 10:39.290
As in vampire, not filet.
You in?

10:40.596 --> 10:42.032
I filled up on bread anyhow.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.644
Good.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.428
I got your texts.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.997
Wynonna, I am sorry.

10:52.129 --> 10:55.524
In the haze of the forest,
I did not recognize him
and I brought him to Jeremy--

11:01.530 --> 11:02.923
Argh.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.403
You can try, but that rope's
soaked in holy water.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.535
Who did this?

11:07.797 --> 11:09.973
-Wynonna.
-Yeah.

11:10.017 --> 11:13.498
She wanted to discuss
a few things with Kate
without you interrupting.

11:14.717 --> 11:19.853
Oh, I'm getting good at that.
Oi! Lady bloodsucker,
show yourself!

11:19.896 --> 11:21.506
Oh, shit!

11:21.550 --> 11:22.856
I was wondering
when you'd pop in.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.945
Why do you get
a better entrance?

11:24.988 --> 11:26.424
Been working on them
for a century.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.037
: Hello!
: Hey!

11:30.080 --> 11:31.603
-Welcome!
-Oh, long time no...

11:31.647 --> 11:33.170
-I'm great.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.172
-Ooh, it's cold outside.
-I know.

11:35.216 --> 11:38.828
-Yeah, I got bit, um...

11:38.872 --> 11:41.875
-Yeah.
-Oh, uh, he... got a bit cold.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.964
He got a bit cold
on his rounds.

11:44.007 --> 11:46.314
-Oh, poor Robin. Come with me.
-Okay.

11:46.357 --> 11:49.360
Yeah. Listen,
I'm so behind schedule
with the food.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.361
-It's okay.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.754
-Oh, is that--
-Wine, yeah. Yeah.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.017
Thank you. Listen,
how do you feel about potatoes?

11:54.061 --> 11:57.281
-Oh, I find them very a-peeling.
-Okay, uh, take care of him.

11:57.325 --> 12:00.720
-Hey, let me grab your coat.
-Oh, uh, yes, sure. Oh...

12:00.763 --> 12:03.331
Hey, what up
Any apps?

12:03.374 --> 12:05.028
You making any appetizers?

12:05.072 --> 12:07.117
Uh, wow, you're really nervous.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.902
Jeremy, it's just dinner.
It's mostly drinks.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.731
Yeah, but you only get
crowned sheriff once.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.385
Am I right?
Do you get a crown?
Is there a crown?

12:14.429 --> 12:17.084
That would be... great.
Have you heard from Wynonna
at all?

12:19.434 --> 12:20.478
Your husband bit someone.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.525
An innocent person, a friend.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.180
He was hungry.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.486
That's the price we pay
for having Doc forever and ever.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.140
I don't remember ordering that.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.142
You're blaming his choices
on me?

12:32.186 --> 12:34.492
And here I thought
you were the progressive type.

12:34.536 --> 12:39.933
Sexy lady vampire isn't exactly
hashtag modern feminism either.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.586
You tricked him
like you did before.

12:41.630 --> 12:47.201
You seduced him with your...
designer vampire pheromones...

12:47.244 --> 12:50.073
That's what you think.
For real?

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
-Laugh while you still can.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.906
I'm gonna shoot you
through your undead heart
and give Doc back his soul.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.823
-Come on. The whiskey's warm.
-You monster.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.478
You should at least
get to know a lady
before you try to kill her.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.567
It's a good story.

13:05.610 --> 13:08.744
-Meh, I'm sort of over stories.
-Doc is the one responsible
for turning me.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.877
You said
you'd always been a vampire.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.226
I lied.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.187
Fine.

13:17.231 --> 13:20.451
But if you start doing voices,
I'm shooting us both.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.412
My family is from Europe.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.806
And we weren't vampires,
we were nobility.

13:27.894 --> 13:30.113
And, God, don't look shocked.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.594
We all know who wrote history
and how they have a habit

13:32.637 --> 13:36.990
of leaving people who look
like me out of official records.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.209
We came looking for liberty.

13:39.253 --> 13:42.430
We found... a cesspool.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.693
Both my parents died
soon after we arrived.

13:44.736 --> 13:48.088
I was supposed to return
to Hungary
and my creepy Uncle Otto.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.873
But I knew what he was.

13:50.917 --> 13:54.659
I knew a lot of things.
It was a useful talent.

13:54.703 --> 13:57.053
Now,
this card represents the past.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.578
This one, the present.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.713
And this...

14:07.498 --> 14:09.196
You'll be engaged within a year.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.504
-Oh, thank you!
-Welcome.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.898
Then one evening,
I met a man I refused to read.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.860
It wasn't that I couldn't read
his future,
it's that I wouldn't.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.905
-Do it.
-I won't.

14:22.949 --> 14:26.430
-The lady... said no.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.737
This is no business of yours.

14:29.738 --> 14:32.088
I have this aimed
at yourbusiness.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.873
Take your money and go.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.279
Sir, wait.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.154
May I buy you a drink?

14:54.197 --> 14:56.765
Now, what heartless bastard...

14:56.808 --> 14:58.767
could deny you a thing?

15:02.727 --> 15:04.555
Barkeep!

15:07.210 --> 15:09.212
:
Doc to the rescue, huh?

15:09.256 --> 15:11.084
You paint
quite a pretty picture.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.955
Yeah, well, it gets
a lot less pretty.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.566
Say what you want
about John Henry Holliday...

15:16.437 --> 15:18.656
He's never boring.

15:18.700 --> 15:22.225
How did you end up taking
a bite out of this kid anyhow?

15:22.269 --> 15:25.098
Let me loose
and I'll give a demonstration.

15:25.141 --> 15:29.058
I can handle myself
against you, in any way at all.

15:29.102 --> 15:32.540
You are but a passing whim
and you'll never last.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.282
Oh, I have no problem lasting,
old-timer.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.503
-No problem at all.

15:39.547 --> 15:42.463
: We're closed!

15:42.506 --> 15:45.118
Oh. What is that?

15:45.161 --> 15:49.383
Charlie...
welcome to Purgatory.

15:59.262 --> 16:02.657
: Ah! Ah, ah!
What do I do, what do I do,
what I do?!

16:02.700 --> 16:05.225
-Let me loose, Charlie! Now!

16:23.634 --> 16:26.159
We just got attacked by a woman
with a barbecued skull.

16:26.202 --> 16:31.164
Then I punched her
through the heart,
as you do if you are me.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.339
What do we do with her?

16:35.995 --> 16:36.996
Salt.

16:38.823 --> 16:42.001
-It is a witch thing.
Call Wynonna.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.047
-She didn't want
to be disturbed.
-Call her!

16:45.091 --> 16:46.744
You're a lot like Wyatt,
you know?

16:46.788 --> 16:50.618
-Same eyes.
Full of mischief and foreboding.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.751
You're not gonna talk me
out of shooting you with
your fortune tellery adjectives.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.276
Ad...verbs. Nouns.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.587
-They'll leave a message.
-I just didn't think

17:03.631 --> 17:05.937
you wanted to hear
any more about me and Doc.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.984
Maybe it makes you
uncomfortable.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.554
No, there's no me-and-Doc,
so you're welcome to as much
you-and-Doc as you can handle.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.208
'Cause I can...

17:15.251 --> 17:17.775
too... handle it.

17:17.819 --> 17:22.258
And yet you dropped everything,
even your fine-ass date,
to come over here.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.439
Um, yeah, to do my job?

17:29.483 --> 17:33.400
To turn Doc back
into a regular asshole
instead of a...

17:33.443 --> 17:35.271
vampire asshole.

17:35.315 --> 17:38.796
You don't make Doc Holliday
do anything, Wynonna.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.407
He makes you.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.587
I love you.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.940
Smells like rain is comin'.

17:56.292 --> 18:01.123
Henry... I bought a ticket
for the coach next week.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.298
To New York.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.301
What is in New York?

18:06.607 --> 18:07.956
A ship.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.093
You're going home...
back to Hungary.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.747
Yes.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.793
What do you think?

18:22.753 --> 18:25.930
I came here to build a life,
make my own way,

18:25.974 --> 18:27.454
and it's not working.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.674
Purgatory, Las Vegas,
Kansas City -

18:30.718 --> 18:33.329
they're just places
we pass on through them
and forget them.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.462
Well, we were pretty drunk.

18:37.638 --> 18:41.120
Well... then I'm sure you won't
be remembering me much longer.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.736
Are you playing games with me,
girl?

18:49.737 --> 18:50.781
No!

18:52.174 --> 18:54.437
Smart.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.136
'Cause Doc Holliday
never loses at games.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.191
Doc?

19:19.375 --> 19:22.813
: This is some
beautiful revisionist
love story bullshit.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.902
Just get to the part
where you abandoned him.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.427
-He had Wyatt.
-You left him alone,

19:27.470 --> 19:31.126
and he was sick and scared
and dying!

19:31.170 --> 19:32.475
Now, what could
a fortune

19:32.519 --> 19:33.868
Cry over him?

19:34.912 --> 19:35.652
You palmed him.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.219
He also taught me that.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.233
Dammit.

19:51.277 --> 19:54.323
That is a bigger tiny sword.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.761
So...

19:57.805 --> 19:59.720
Jeremy. Hmm?

19:59.763 --> 20:01.374
Quite the catch.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.463
You know, judging
from your roster
of high-school boyfriends,

20:03.506 --> 20:05.116
I'm not sure I can accept
that compliment.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.642
Ha. Says the guy
who dated Chrissy Nedley
for two semesters!

20:10.905 --> 20:12.254
I did. You know, poor girl,
I made her watch Friday Night
Lights, like, six times.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.169
-Oh, sure.

20:19.522 --> 20:22.221
What do you think a potato feels
when it's in the ground?

20:23.396 --> 20:26.573
Uh... you know, I-I...

20:26.616 --> 20:29.576
haven't really thought
about... that.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.274
I have been thinking about it.

20:33.623 --> 20:36.409
Seeds in the ground
whispering to one another.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.542
Bulshar can talk to them,
you know.

20:40.674 --> 20:43.067
Wait. Robin, can you hear them?

20:43.981 --> 20:48.203
The trees? Do you know
what he's telling them to do?

20:48.247 --> 20:51.424
Sometimes I want to lay down
and let the forest have me.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.910
So, uh, he's out there,
he's minding his own business--

20:59.954 --> 21:02.826
Okay, okay, just slow down,
take it easy, okay?

21:02.870 --> 21:07.222
Yeah, I would, but now I'm
freaking out at the giant ring
sticking out of your biscuit.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.315
-Guys.
-Whoa.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.012
Oh, my God.

21:15.056 --> 21:17.101
Oh, my God, this is happening!

21:17.145 --> 21:19.278
-Yes!!
-I feel dizzy!
-Me too!

21:19.321 --> 21:22.106
Hey, I better be
your Bae of Honour.
-Of course.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.978
This is Bulshar's ring.

21:24.021 --> 21:26.023
-Oh.
-Oh.

21:27.068 --> 21:30.419
-I threw this away.
-Yeah, and I locked it away
just today!

21:30.463 --> 21:33.030
!
-Yeah, Wynonna gave it to me.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.076
She got it from Doc.
Stupid Doc.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.383
Guys, something's
really, really wrong with Robin.

21:37.426 --> 21:40.647
-I mean, he probably just has
meet-the-parents jitters.
-No, from the trees.

21:40.690 --> 21:44.303
-Bulshar's ring is following me.
-Yeah, and Doc's a vampire
and he bit Robin.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.393
: What?!
-Is that why Robin
just licked a potato?

21:47.436 --> 21:49.917
Because, you guys,
Robin just licked a potato!

21:49.960 --> 21:51.875
-Yeah.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.356
Also, I think he just left.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.052
So...

21:58.621 --> 22:00.754
She's got a good-sized trunk
on her.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.364
Right?

22:02.408 --> 22:05.498
Who cares that she failed
her emissions test.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.684
Ugh.

22:17.727 --> 22:20.469
Still smells like Bobo Del Shit
down here!

22:20.513 --> 22:23.429
This where you hide
all your bodies?

22:23.472 --> 22:27.302
This was my personal hell
for over 100 years.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.174
Till the Earp heir came
to retrieve Peacemaker.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.657
Wynonna rescued you?

22:34.701 --> 22:37.356
You know, unfortunately,
she doesn't seem
to be available this evening.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.707
Might want to get used to that.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.318
Oh. Oh, oh!

22:43.362 --> 22:45.320
She put herself
back together again!

22:45.364 --> 22:48.149
-Shoot the tires!
-I'm not gonna shoot Charlene!

22:48.192 --> 22:49.150
No, but...

22:52.240 --> 22:54.634
Oh, goddamn,
it seems only fair.

22:54.677 --> 22:57.463
I stole her car,
now she stole mine.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.118
That was Constance,
who put me in the well,

23:01.162 --> 23:03.947
and damned if I didn't almost
get to return the favour.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.384
I thought a witch
threw you in the well.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.168
Constance Clootie
is the Stone Witch.

23:07.211 --> 23:10.737
Resurrected by Bulshar,
her husband, no doubt.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.434
I'm gonna need a chart.

23:12.478 --> 23:15.219
No, we're gonna need
better shoes.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.919
: Hey, Robin?
: Robin?

23:18.962 --> 23:21.269
: Robin, it's freezing.
You don't have a coat.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.967
: Robin?
: Guys,
let's check in the barn.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.578
: Sweetie,
are you in here?

23:28.537 --> 23:30.191
: Oh, his stuff.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.584
Robin?

23:33.803 --> 23:35.457
: Where is he?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.635
: Soon.

23:42.551 --> 23:44.379
It'll all be over soon.

23:47.034 --> 23:49.950
We need
to keep fertilizing the soil.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.129
Tired?

23:55.172 --> 23:57.000
No. You?

23:57.044 --> 23:59.220
Pfft. Nah.

23:59.263 --> 24:02.223
But how long do you figure
this standoff is gonna last?

24:02.266 --> 24:05.835
You got monster

24:07.271 --> 24:09.796
Unless something
more interesting happens.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.455
Hey. Hey.

24:24.419 --> 24:27.335
What did he do to her?

24:33.559 --> 24:35.474
-That was--
-The Stone Witch.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.088
I hardly recognized her
without her resting witch face.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.959
How did you know?

24:43.003 --> 24:47.094
Power recognizes power,
even if it is fading.

24:47.137 --> 24:50.489
She's looking for... Doc?

24:50.532 --> 24:52.839
-Someone.
-Or something.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.974
-I could go on ahead
if you want.
-I can keep up.

24:58.018 --> 25:01.325
You see me keeping up, right?
I have to pass a physical
every three months.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.502
Oh, I'm much faster
if I choose to be.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.460
You can barely stand.
You need blood.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.464
I would refrain
from mentioning that substance.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.468
I already lost control once
today and the only reason
I didn't tear out his throat

25:13.512 --> 25:16.776
was for the taste
of moulding earth.
-Take it easy.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.778
Huh? Oh.

25:18.821 --> 25:21.128
Alright, alright,
I got you...

25:22.825 --> 25:25.959
-Take it easy!
-This is me taking it easy!

25:28.483 --> 25:31.051
Oh, hell... just do it.

25:35.925 --> 25:37.753
Like a sack
of Old West potatoes.

25:38.841 --> 25:41.278
"How was your date night,
Charlie?"

25:41.322 --> 25:42.758
It was a little tense.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.980
He's like a beautiful,
shirtless Roomba.

25:47.023 --> 25:50.723
-We need to get him inside.
-Or get him talking. I...

25:50.766 --> 25:52.725
I think he might be tapping
the bad guy's phone lines.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.250
What can you hear, Robin?

25:57.294 --> 25:58.948
They entombed him...

25:58.992 --> 26:00.341
for decades...

26:01.647 --> 26:02.691
but he's close now.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.565
Bulshar

26:11.787 --> 26:12.788
Hi.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.052
This is not the bathroom.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.359
Uh, no, you're in the barn.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.319
Okay, maybe don't step
in this general area.

26:22.363 --> 26:23.930
What are you doing out here?

26:23.973 --> 26:26.019
I heard whispers.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.717
I think it's... the tree roots?
They don't want to,

26:28.761 --> 26:31.285
but he's making them
do his bidding. Bulshar.

26:32.373 --> 26:35.245
-Shit, I know...
I know this sounds crazy.
-Hey.

26:35.289 --> 26:38.597
I survived a massacre
and I'm being haunted
by a demon's ring.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.731
Yeah, I touched tentacle goo
and made a lightning rod
of spoons.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.864
I was in a car crash
when I was a kid,

26:44.907 --> 26:46.517
trapped with my mother's body
for three days,

26:46.561 --> 26:48.432
and now I can sense when
my friends are super scared.

26:50.478 --> 26:54.221
You're not crazy.
Also not the first person
to pee in this barn.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.877
-We have a bathroom.
Seriously?

26:57.920 --> 27:02.838
You have my affection.
Now, how about giving me
your potato?

27:02.882 --> 27:03.926
With pleasure.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.324
The rest of you seeing that lady
with the flame-broiled
noggin over there?

27:12.805 --> 27:14.763
Constance Clootie!

27:14.807 --> 27:17.200
Woman, can't I have
one goddamn dinner party

27:17.244 --> 27:19.942
without you getting all up
in my biscuits?!

27:25.252 --> 27:26.949
Oh, my God!

27:26.993 --> 27:29.778
-I'm okay.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.651
-She belongs to Bulshar, too.
-Whoa, hey.

27:32.694 --> 27:35.436
I just found a man I like.
I'm not losing him
to some woman.

27:35.479 --> 27:38.831
Especially one
with grill marks!

27:41.921 --> 27:45.315
-Ah, uh, hot. It's hot.

27:45.359 --> 27:48.710
Ah, hot, hot. Hot!

27:48.754 --> 27:50.538
Waverly, don't touch it!

27:54.063 --> 27:56.283
It... it fits me.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.243
What are you doing?!
No, no, no!!

28:00.287 --> 28:02.593
-Whoa.

28:09.035 --> 28:11.559
What... Since when did you get
a finishing move?

28:15.737 --> 28:18.305
Was that whole thing normal
for you guys?

28:18.348 --> 28:21.090
Honestly? Yeah, kind of.

28:21.134 --> 28:24.615
Yeah, let's go get some wine.
Three for me.

28:24.659 --> 28:25.791
Okay.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.968
Thank you.

28:33.146 --> 28:35.452
Zombie Skullhead Constance
was going through Doc's stuff.

28:35.496 --> 28:38.455
-Yeah, as far as we could tell,

28:38.499 --> 28:41.023
she only took three cards.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.938
Red border. Vintage.

28:42.982 --> 28:44.548
Tarot cards.

28:44.592 --> 28:45.854
Kate's,
from when they first met.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.814
Henry palmed the cards
after the reading.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.859
He always swore he didn't,
but I knew he did.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.731
Whose cards were they?
You never said.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.822
Well, at that point,
he was just a sheriff.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.828
I'm the Sheriff Clootie.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.875
And I'm looking for something.
In the Ghost River Triangle.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.836
They say that place is cursed.
-I'm close,

29:12.141 --> 29:14.491
but one piece eludes me.

29:14.535 --> 29:18.234
Powerful though I am...
I cannot find it on my own.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.454
So you will do it.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.431
This card represents the past.

29:44.652 --> 29:46.219
This, the present.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.528
The...

29:53.139 --> 29:54.793
-I can't read your future.
-Finish it.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.446
No, I mean, I won't!

29:58.492 --> 29:59.275
Do it.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.537
The lady...

30:02.452 --> 30:03.323
said no.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.673
This is no business of yours.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.807
I have this aimed
at your business!

30:08.850 --> 30:11.374
Take your money and go.

30:11.418 --> 30:13.594
: But leave the cards.

30:27.782 --> 30:31.873
You read Sheriff Clootie...
Bulshar's cards?

30:31.917 --> 30:34.963
Not all of them.
He wants to find his last one.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.051
His future.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.315
Or is it now his present?

30:41.535 --> 30:43.972
Then we better intercept
the bitch kebab and make sure
she doesn't give it to him.

30:49.935 --> 30:52.372
Don't underestimate the power
of this relic.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.504
It's older
than most things on earth.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.384
Oh, fudge nuggets.

31:05.559 --> 31:07.517
It couldn't have been
a princess cut?

31:28.234 --> 31:29.452
Past.

31:34.544 --> 31:35.894
Present.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.248
Glorious future.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.574
Constance.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.143
It's okay.

32:09.753 --> 32:12.843
-We're too late.
-God, she can't even speak.

32:13.975 --> 32:17.152
-Made her pathetic.

32:19.589 --> 32:23.637
Listen, you've been a thorn
in my side for way too long,
Stone Witch.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.293
But nobody deserves
to be somebody's meat puppet.

32:28.816 --> 32:29.512
Help us find him.

32:31.601 --> 32:34.126
She has nothing left to give,
Wynonna.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.128
She's as cursed as you are.

32:38.391 --> 32:39.958
Sucks, right?

32:41.176 --> 32:42.743
So does this.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.142
It's no small thing...

32:50.185 --> 32:52.187
to be able
to choose your own end.

33:09.335 --> 33:12.512
-I've got a buddy
who's a paramedic.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.993
We didn't know your blood type,
so we went with a...

33:15.994 --> 33:18.648
...nice, neutral... O negative.

33:20.302 --> 33:21.086
Thank you.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.437
Those canines aren't made
for nachos.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.009
Perhaps this way I can avoid
run-ins with friends of friends.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.892
I like her, Doc.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.938
I'm thirsty, not stupid.

33:49.810 --> 33:51.812
You don't know her like I do.

33:56.817 --> 34:00.299
You will never know her...
like I do.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.431
I know she hunts
what you've become.

34:12.093 --> 34:15.096
Well, she will come
to understand.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.667
You know how many readings
I've done since then?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.538
It was a bad one.
I chose to forget.

34:22.582 --> 34:25.585
Bullshit's always
one step ahead.

34:25.628 --> 34:29.241
But he's still just a demon.
While you, Wynonna Earp,

34:29.284 --> 34:31.504
are the best demon hunter
I've seen in a long time.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.593
Certainly the prettiest.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.769
You're trying to make me forget
about killing you.

34:37.597 --> 34:41.296
You know my death
won't return Doc to mortality.
It's a myth.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.256
Well, you should've led
with that.

34:46.954 --> 34:50.262
It'd be awesome if...
Bulshar's cards just said:

34:50.305 --> 34:54.092
"Hey, Bulshar, you're a...
big old bag of deflated dicks.

34:55.615 --> 34:58.618
-Yeah, I...
I haven't seen that card.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.577
There's no "ye big olde sack
of airless dingadongies" card?

35:01.621 --> 35:04.624
Okay, you mock,
but the Tarot has a lot to say

35:04.667 --> 35:06.582
to those
with the will to listen.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.718
Then my will...

35:11.761 --> 35:14.590
is a stone-cold,
be-mulleted iron woman.

35:15.678 --> 35:16.636
On steroids.

35:18.246 --> 35:22.424
Girl, I'm a mystic and I still
can't decode that sentence.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.297
As an Earp, I'm linked...
to Bulshar.

35:25.340 --> 35:28.517
Call it fate or whatever,
but we're all linked
by this curse,

35:28.561 --> 35:33.435
so maybe...
we share a future too.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.481
So I read your cards
to know his.

35:35.524 --> 35:37.396
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:37.439 --> 35:40.529
You're certain?
They may tell you something
you don't wish to know.

35:40.573 --> 35:43.402
Lady, I'm... made of things
I don't wish to know.

35:45.621 --> 35:48.755
Why did you put it on?!

35:48.798 --> 35:50.713
I was meant to.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.019
What does that mean?

35:52.933 --> 35:54.587
I don't know.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.980
But don't you think it's weird
that I can't get it off either?

35:57.024 --> 35:58.678
-Whoa, wait, wait, wait!
-Ow!

35:58.721 --> 36:00.767
Ow! Jeremy,
my finger's still attached.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.203
Sorry, sorry, but...

36:02.247 --> 36:05.946
What's that? Maybe... Hebrew,
or Aramaic?

36:05.989 --> 36:07.991
That wasn't there before.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.645
What?

36:09.689 --> 36:12.170
Okay, wait. Your finger
made this word appear?

36:13.475 --> 36:16.783
Dictionaries.
We need dictionaries, people!

36:16.826 --> 36:19.220
I know why Bulshar's
in the Ghost River Triangle!

36:19.264 --> 36:21.483
Perfect Nose Kate read my cards!

36:21.527 --> 36:24.530
I'm apparently Tarot twins
with Bulshar.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.271
We think
these are the cards he wanted.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.012
First, the past.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.971
The devil, 'cause, yeah,

36:31.014 --> 36:33.930
our family's taken
a whole metric shit-ton
from that demon-bag.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.672
The next card
represents the present.

36:36.716 --> 36:39.675
Bulshar wants... The Tower.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.373
Well, that's obviously
a wang metaphor.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.723
Kate says that represents
darkness and destruction.

36:43.766 --> 36:45.725
Yeah, like I said,
Bulshar's wang.

36:46.639 --> 36:49.555
But if he gets it,
his future is gonna be...

36:52.993 --> 36:56.039
Make Um,
is this about Bulshar's wang?

36:56.083 --> 36:59.739
-It's the first two lovers
who ever...

37:04.004 --> 37:05.614
The first first lovers, guys!

37:05.658 --> 37:09.227
The first two to grab some birds
and rub 'em on their bees.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.272
Season one,
episode one of Boneland?

37:11.316 --> 37:15.537
So the couple normally
referred to as Adam and Eve.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.670
Okay. So the devil...

37:18.584 --> 37:19.367
The Tower.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.022
-Adam and Eve.
-Paradise!

37:23.415 --> 37:26.374
Jeremy!
You dunked on my mic drop, man.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.376
No, it-it's Arabic on the ring.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.726
It means Garden of Paradise.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.859
-That's what he's after.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.253
Okay, so I had
negligent hippie parents

37:35.296 --> 37:37.124
and I smoked cigarettes
behind the church

37:37.167 --> 37:40.170
instead of ever going in,
but is paradise...

37:40.214 --> 37:42.172
supposed to be
in North America?

37:42.216 --> 37:45.132
In the fudging Ghost River
Triangle no less?

37:45.175 --> 37:48.353
Juan Carlo said this
was a sanctuary, right?

37:48.396 --> 37:50.442
That's why.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.835
-He's looking for thegarden.
-No.

37:53.923 --> 37:55.273
He's not looking
for the Garden of Eden.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.145
He already found it.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.198
I'd invite you in, but...

38:08.242 --> 38:10.113
But I'm a vampire.
You're not ready?

38:10.157 --> 38:12.333
-Ding, ding, ding.
-Smart girl.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.989
Charlie said
he'll call you later.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.734
We were all just trying to have
a nice dinner for once, y'know?

38:21.777 --> 38:23.823
Yeah, well,
someone had a good time.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.700
Kinda wish he hadn't signed
it "Buttercup."

38:31.744 --> 38:34.094
Something to be said
about the sentimental man.

38:35.095 --> 38:38.577
Or one who tells you
that he's feeling something.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.100
Anything.

38:40.143 --> 38:43.277
-You gave up on Doc.
-I hoped he'd chase me
for once.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.369
Instead I left him thinking
he had nothing left.
Nothing to lose.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.284
So he went and made a deal
with a witch.

38:51.459 --> 38:53.374
One last attempt
to escape the disease.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.333
She threw him down a well.

38:56.769 --> 38:59.554
-He was alone.
-But I came back.

38:59.598 --> 39:02.340
Don't you see, Wynonna?
I wasplaying a game.

39:04.211 --> 39:06.648
But this time, I lost.

39:06.692 --> 39:10.739
Where is John Henry Holliday,
Mrs. Clootie?!
Where is my husband?!

39:10.783 --> 39:14.047
Husband? Oh, come now,
wasn't he still paying you?

39:14.090 --> 39:15.440
Tell me what you've done.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.925
Do you feel pain?
Do you feel loss?

39:23.926 --> 39:25.450
Good.

39:25.493 --> 39:27.843
It's a balm to my own wounds.

39:29.018 --> 39:30.672
I am a mother.

39:30.716 --> 39:34.415
A mother whose children
were slain for no reason.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.374
That is pain.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.332
That is loss.

39:43.163 --> 39:45.470
Doc had nothing
to do with that!

39:45.513 --> 39:47.297
No, but his best friend,
Wyatt Earp, did.

39:47.341 --> 39:48.734
Doc is innocent!

39:49.735 --> 39:50.997
Even you don't believe that.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.783
I feel it.
I know he's still alive.

39:54.827 --> 39:57.699
And will be always,
as per our deal.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.397
But you could search
for centuries

39:59.440 --> 40:01.137
and never come close
to finding him.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.403
I'm gonna try.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.101
How?
I'm fresh out of immortality.

40:08.144 --> 40:10.843
I don't need you for that,
bitch.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.020
Or you could...

40:14.063 --> 40:15.848
leave him behind
like he left you.

40:16.849 --> 40:19.895
Consider it my consolation gift:

40:19.939 --> 40:21.157
your independence.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.773
Turns out
independence didn't take.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.557
That's when you went
to see your uncle Otto?

40:31.472 --> 40:35.215
Claimed my immortal kiss.
So I could search for him
forever.

40:36.782 --> 40:39.524
But it was you who found him.
Freed him.

40:40.525 --> 40:43.484
-It was an accident.
-Yeah, well...

40:43.528 --> 40:45.268
the universe loves a bad joke.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.189
You became a vampire for Doc?

40:55.409 --> 40:56.889
And he became one for you.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.284
Goodbye, Wynonna.

41:01.328 --> 41:04.679
-See if I can find a stagecoach.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.613
-Wynonna.
-Jesus!

41:25.657 --> 41:27.310
You just about gave me
a heart attack.

41:27.354 --> 41:30.009
Well, I was uninvited
from the house, remember?

41:31.358 --> 41:34.622
So now I skulk in the barn
like the dog you think I am.

41:35.536 --> 41:38.800
Just because you can hide
in the shadows
doesn't mean you should.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.548
I am done hiding from you.

41:51.291 --> 41:52.771
I don't like you like this.

41:54.599 --> 41:57.253
I have become this...

41:57.297 --> 41:58.907
...because I am determined

41:58.951 --> 42:01.780
to be here
for as long as you require.

42:01.823 --> 42:05.305
If you should fall,
to fight for Alice and beyond
if necessary.

42:06.959 --> 42:09.352
You think I can't do this?

42:09.396 --> 42:11.224
I think we need
to do this together.

42:15.184 --> 42:16.316
Good.

42:18.187 --> 42:21.321
The curse ends now...
with both of us.

42:22.409 --> 42:23.845
It has to.

42:26.239 --> 42:27.849
