01:27.467 --> 01:28.767
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO MEET HIM

01:28.767 --> 01:29.800
FOR YEARS.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.367
>> THAT IS TONY CRAWFORD.

01:31.367 --> 01:32.600
I'M SORRY, I HADN'T MADE IT UP

01:32.600 --> 01:33.900
TO HIS FACE YET.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.300
>> KEISHA, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

01:35.300 --> 01:36.533
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:36.533 --> 01:38.267
I FORGET WHAT YEAR IT WAS,

01:38.267 --> 01:40.067
BUT HIS TEAM WAS IN TOWN AND SHE

01:40.067 --> 01:41.633
JUST HAD TO MEET HIM.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.100
SO OF COURSE IT WAS UP TO ME

01:43.100 --> 01:44.133
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.800
I FOUND OUT WHAT HOTEL HE WAS

01:45.800 --> 01:47.633
STAYING IN, SNUCK HER PAST

01:47.633 --> 01:49.200
SECURITY TO HIS ROOM.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.367
DO YOU KNOW WHEN WE KNOCKED ON

01:50.367 --> 01:51.300
THE DOOR AND HE OPENED IT,

01:51.300 --> 01:52.200
I WAS THE ONLY ONE STANDING

01:52.200 --> 01:53.433
THERE?

01:53.433 --> 01:55.367
MM-HMM, THIS HEIFER HAD RUN ALL

01:55.367 --> 01:57.700
THE WAY BACK TO THE ELEVATOR.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.733
>> I WAS SHY.

01:58.733 --> 02:00.067
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

02:00.067 --> 02:01.100
>> YOU COULDA STARTED WITH,

02:01.100 --> 02:02.067
"LET'S GO, KEISHA," SO HE

02:02.067 --> 02:02.933
WOULDN'T THINK I WAS THE

02:02.933 --> 02:03.600
GROUPIE.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.400
>> YOU'RE STILL MY GIRL FOR

02:04.400 --> 02:05.167
THAT.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.067
>> MMM, I'M SURE.

02:06.067 --> 02:07.067
>> BUT I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH

02:07.067 --> 02:08.167
HIM EVER SINCE MIAMI CRUSHED

02:08.167 --> 02:10.167
GEORGIA TECH IN THE ORANGE BOWL.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.400
HE HOLDS THE SINGLE SEASON

02:11.400 --> 02:13.767
RECORD FOR SACKS, AND HE RETIRED

02:13.767 --> 02:15.233
WITH THREE SUPER BOWL RINGS.

02:15.233 --> 02:16.400
>> THE RING YOU NEED TO BE

02:16.400 --> 02:19.333
CHECKING FOR IS THIS ONE.

02:19.333 --> 02:21.200
ALL CLEAR.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.567
SO GO TALK TO HIM.

02:22.567 --> 02:23.433
>> I CAN'T TALK TO HIM.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.500
>> DON'T START THAT AGAIN.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.633
>> CAN SOMEONE HELP ME, PLEASE?

02:26.633 --> 02:29.433
>> SHE WILL.

02:29.433 --> 02:30.633
>> [giggles] HI.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.300
>> HI.

02:31.300 --> 02:32.067
>> I'M RAQUEL.

02:32.067 --> 02:32.800
>> TONY.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.067
>> HOW CAN I ASSIST YOU?

02:34.067 --> 02:35.200
>> DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING CUT FOR

02:35.200 --> 02:36.833
A GUY MY SIZE?

02:36.833 --> 02:38.533
>> WE MAY HAVE A FEW ITEMS,

02:38.533 --> 02:39.867
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY

02:39.867 --> 02:42.800
CUSTOM-TAILOR ANYTHING.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.133
I KNOW YOU MUST GET THIS ALL THE

02:44.133 --> 02:46.767
TIME, BUT I AM A HUGE FAN.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.833
>> WELL, NOT AS MUCH AS I USED

02:47.833 --> 02:49.933
TO AND RARELY FROM A WOMAN

02:49.933 --> 02:51.867
AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.667
>> THANK YOU.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.267
>> OKAY, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

02:55.267 --> 02:56.367
I'VE BEEN INVITED TO THE WHITE

02:56.367 --> 02:57.567
HOUSE TO AN EVENT WITH THE FIRST

02:57.567 --> 02:58.933
LADY ON YOUTH FITNESS.

02:58.933 --> 03:00.300
I WANT TO LOOK SPIFFY, BUT I

03:00.300 --> 03:01.700
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO WEAR,

03:01.700 --> 03:02.833
SO...

03:02.833 --> 03:03.833
>> WELL, IF YOU GIVE ME A DAY,

03:03.833 --> 03:05.567
I CAN PULL SOME CLOTHES FOR YOU.

03:05.567 --> 03:06.900
I THINK I HAVE A FEEL FOR YOUR

03:06.900 --> 03:07.867
STYLE.

03:07.867 --> 03:08.633
>> THANK YOU.

03:08.633 --> 03:09.767
ANYTHING TO SHUT MY BOYS UP.

03:09.767 --> 03:10.933
THEY ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY

03:10.933 --> 03:14.100
ABOUT WHAT I WEAR.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.600
>> UM...

03:15.600 --> 03:17.333
BEFORE YOU GO, THERE'S SOMETHING

03:17.333 --> 03:18.600
THAT'S BEEN NAGGING ME.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.400
YOUR LAST SEASON, WHY DID YOU

03:20.400 --> 03:22.067
GUYS SWITCH TO A 3-4?

03:22.067 --> 03:23.367
IT KILLED THE PASS RUSH.

03:23.367 --> 03:25.200
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
>> YEAH.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.067
AND THE OWNER GOT ON MY DAMN

03:27.067 --> 03:27.700
NERVES TOO.

03:27.700 --> 03:28.433
I MEAN, LET THE COACH DO HIS

03:28.433 --> 03:29.100
JOB.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.400
THAT'S WHY YOU HIRED HIM.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.567
>> WOW.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.567
YOU KNOW YOUR FOOTBALL, HUH?

03:33.567 --> 03:34.367
>> LITTLE BIT.

03:34.367 --> 03:35.267
>> AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT

03:35.267 --> 03:36.167
FILET MIGNON?

03:36.167 --> 03:37.167
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME IN

03:37.167 --> 03:38.167
HAVING SOME?

03:38.167 --> 03:40.067
>> I DON'T EAT RED MEAT.

03:40.067 --> 03:41.500
BUT I'D LOVE TO JOIN YOU AND

03:41.500 --> 03:43.067
TELL YOU HOW BAD IT IS THE WHOLE

03:43.067 --> 03:43.900
TIME YOU EAT IT.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.633
>> [laughs]

03:45.633 --> 03:48.433
>> UM...

03:48.433 --> 03:51.233
LET ME KNOW WHEN.

03:51.233 --> 03:54.933
>> * READY, STEADY

03:54.933 --> 03:56.667
* READY, STEADY, GO

03:56.667 --> 03:58.167

03:58.167 --> 04:00.233
* DIG IN

04:00.233 --> 04:02.067
>> WHO NEEDS PORN WHEN WE HAVE

04:02.067 --> 04:02.900
APRIL?

04:02.900 --> 04:03.833
>> EW.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.467
PDA IS ICKY WHEN YOU'RE NOT ONE

04:05.467 --> 04:06.933
OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED.

04:06.933 --> 04:09.067
>> OOH, LOOK AT HER GO.

04:09.067 --> 04:14.633
AND GO AND GO.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.667
>> OH, HEY, GUYS.

04:16.667 --> 04:17.733
THINK I LEFT MY PHONE.

04:17.733 --> 04:19.233
YEAH.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.467
HOW'S IT GOING?

04:20.467 --> 04:22.233
>> WE SHOULD BE ASKING YOU THAT.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.867
SO HAVE YOU LET JACK IN YOUR BOX

04:23.867 --> 04:25.667
YET?

04:25.667 --> 04:26.800
>> PLEASE TELL ME THE ANSWER

04:26.800 --> 04:27.900
IS NO.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.267
>> OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, IT IS WAY

04:29.267 --> 04:30.267
TOO EARLY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

04:30.267 --> 04:31.233
TO BE HAVING SEX.

04:31.233 --> 04:32.600
AND SECOND OF ALL, YOU GUYS ARE

04:32.600 --> 04:33.600
JUST NEVER GONNA GET OVER THE

04:33.600 --> 04:34.467
FACT THAT HE'S A STRIPPER,

04:34.467 --> 04:35.167
ARE YOU?

04:35.167 --> 04:35.833
>> DON'T COUNT ON IT.

04:35.833 --> 04:36.933
>> NOT AT ALL.

04:36.933 --> 04:38.600
>> SORRY, BUT HIS PROFESSION

04:38.600 --> 04:40.200
MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.733
GUYS ARE ALREADY SLUTTY.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.067
BUT A GUY WHO DANCES AROUND

04:43.067 --> 04:44.667
NAKED FOR A LIVING MIGHT BE

04:44.667 --> 04:46.533
EVEN MORE SO.

04:46.533 --> 04:49.367
JUST BE CAREFUL.

04:49.367 --> 04:50.967
>> NOT TO STIR THE POT, BUT,

04:50.967 --> 04:52.067
APRIL, QUICK RECAP.

04:52.067 --> 04:53.733
THIS MORNING, TONY CRAWFORD,

04:53.733 --> 04:55.067
FOOTBALL PLAYER EXTRAORDINAIRE,

04:55.067 --> 04:56.400
CAME IN HERE AND ASKED RAQUEL

04:56.400 --> 04:57.333
OUT ON A DATE.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.567
AFTER SHE PICKED HER TONGUE UP

04:58.567 --> 05:00.933
OFF THE FLOOR, SHE SAID YES.

05:00.933 --> 05:03.300
>> SO JACK IS TO BE JUDGED,

05:03.300 --> 05:04.767
BUT A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE,

05:04.767 --> 05:06.267
WHO I'M SURE IS NO VIRGIN,

05:06.267 --> 05:07.267
GETS A PASS?

05:07.267 --> 05:08.667
>> THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU DON'T

05:08.667 --> 05:09.767
KNOW JACK.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.800
I KNOW TONY.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.967
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

05:11.967 --> 05:13.833
I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.667
>> BY RESEARCH, SHE MEANS SHE'S

05:15.667 --> 05:18.267
BEEN STALKING HIM FOR YEARS.

05:18.267 --> 05:19.500
>> LOOK, I KNOW IT SOUNDS

05:19.500 --> 05:21.133
RIDICULOUS, BUT EVERYONE IN

05:21.133 --> 05:22.467
MY FANTASIES IS PERFECT.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.533
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED

05:23.533 --> 05:25.067
FANTASIES.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.100
I'VE NEVER MET DANIEL CRAIG,

05:26.100 --> 05:27.533
BUT I'M POSITIVE HE IS A

05:27.533 --> 05:28.833
TIRELESS LOVER.

05:28.833 --> 05:29.867
>> OH, I GET IT.

05:29.867 --> 05:30.900
YOU MAKE EXCEPTIONS WHEN YOU

05:30.900 --> 05:32.067
WANT TO SLEEP WITH SOMEONE.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.167
>> IT'S TRUE.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.667
IF DAVID BECKHAM WALKED IN HERE

05:34.667 --> 05:36.367
TODAY, I WOULD EXPLAIN VERY

05:36.367 --> 05:37.833
POLITELY TO POSH THAT SHE SHOULD

05:37.833 --> 05:39.567
GO AND HAVE A SPOT OF TEA AND

05:39.567 --> 05:40.800
SOME CRUMPETS BECAUSE ME AND HER

05:40.800 --> 05:43.367
MAN ARE GOING TO BE A WHILE.

05:43.367 --> 05:45.233
>> WELL, IF ENRIQUE IGLESIAS

05:45.233 --> 05:46.300
WALKED IN HERE, I'D BE DOING

05:46.300 --> 05:47.767
SOME SIMILAR 'SPLAINING TO HIS

05:47.767 --> 05:48.933
GIRLFRIEND.

05:48.933 --> 05:50.367
>> IF WE'RE TALKING FANTASY,

05:50.367 --> 05:52.133
MINE IS IDRIS ELBA.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.467
AH.

05:53.467 --> 05:54.600
BUT IF WE ARE TALKING

05:54.600 --> 05:55.733
HYPOCRITICAL, RAQUEL,

05:55.733 --> 05:56.767
THAT WOULD BE YOU.

05:56.767 --> 05:58.900
>> OH, ALL DAY LONG.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.433
>> I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.567
I HAVE TO GO HANDLE SOME THINGS.

06:02.567 --> 06:03.800
>> I'M GONNA GET GOING TOO.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.367
SOMEWHERE LESS JUDGMENTAL,

06:05.367 --> 06:09.333
LIKE THE HAIR SALON.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.600
>> HELLO, CHILDREN.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.300
GREATNESS HAS ARRIVED.

06:16.300 --> 06:17.933
>> ANTHONY WILLIAMS.

06:17.933 --> 06:19.367
I SAW YOU ON PROJECT RUNWAY

06:19.367 --> 06:20.300
ALL STARS.

06:20.300 --> 06:21.800
FINALLY ANOTHER SEASON WORTH

06:21.800 --> 06:23.700
WATCHING.

06:23.700 --> 06:25.067
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.100
I'M SO EXCITED THAT YOU'VE

06:26.100 --> 06:27.500
AGREED TO BE ONE OF THE FEATURED

06:27.500 --> 06:28.900
DESIGNERS FOR MY PARTY.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.300
IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF MY FIRST

06:30.300 --> 06:31.967
MOVES TO REBRAND THE STORE.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.100
>> NOW HOW COULD I SAY NO?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.867
THIS BOUTIQUE IS HOT.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.467
AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE A PARTY?

06:37.467 --> 06:38.467
>> AND I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT

06:38.467 --> 06:39.400
EVEN HOTTER.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.467
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE ABOUT

06:40.467 --> 06:41.767
MY OFFER TO SELL YOUR LINE

06:41.767 --> 06:42.967
HERE EXCLUSIVELY?

06:42.967 --> 06:44.233
>> I'M STILL THINKING.

06:44.233 --> 06:45.467
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A LOT OF

06:45.467 --> 06:46.500
COMPETITION.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.833
THERE'S JEFFREY IN PHIPPS PLAZA,

06:48.833 --> 06:50.667
AND THEN THERE'S JEFFREY,

06:50.667 --> 06:52.633
AND OF COURSE JEFFREY.

06:52.633 --> 06:53.367
>> FAIR ENOUGH.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.600
I LOVE A MAN WHO PLAYS HARD TO

06:54.600 --> 06:55.400
GET.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.867
BUT WATCH OUT, I'LL GET YOU.

06:56.867 --> 06:58.567

AND RAISE 10,000.

07:23.433 --> 07:26.333
MMM, YOU'RE GOING ALL-IN.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.333
BOLD MOVE.

07:27.333 --> 07:31.567
I LIKE YOUR STYLE, GIRL.

07:31.567 --> 07:34.133
>> [chuckles]

07:34.133 --> 07:37.300
I...

07:37.300 --> 07:38.567
THINK YOU'RE BLUFFING,

07:38.567 --> 07:39.267
BEAUTIFUL.

07:39.267 --> 07:40.700
>> MMM.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.100
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND

07:42.100 --> 07:45.367
OUT, HANDSOME.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.300
>> YOU SURE ARE RIGHT.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.633
WHAT THE HELL.

07:48.633 --> 07:51.233
I CALL.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.333
MMM.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.933
MM-MM-MM.

08:00.933 --> 08:02.533
THERE GOES MY THREESOME.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.433
HOW 'BOUT YOU, MISS KEISHA?

08:04.433 --> 08:05.667
HAD ABOUT ALL YOU CAN HANDLE

08:05.667 --> 08:06.367

08:06.367 --> 08:07.833
>> NO, LUKE.

08:07.833 --> 08:12.633
I CAN GO ALL NIGHT.

08:12.633 --> 08:15.633
>> WELL, GO ALL NIGHT YOU SHALL.

08:15.633 --> 08:23.633

08:25.533 --> 08:27.433
MMM.

08:27.433 --> 08:28.967
YOUR STRAIGHT BEAT MY THREE OF

08:28.967 --> 08:31.733
A KIND.

08:31.733 --> 08:35.467
[laughs]

08:35.467 --> 08:37.067
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA

08:37.067 --> 08:38.833
HAVE TO KEEP MY EYES ON YOU.

08:38.833 --> 08:41.067
>> OOH, I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY

08:41.067 --> 08:42.567
WERE.

08:42.567 --> 08:49.367
*

08:49.367 --> 08:51.067
>> BETWEEN YOU AND I,

08:51.067 --> 08:52.700
I'VE BEEN WONDERING EXACTLY

08:52.700 --> 08:53.833
HOW LUCKY I'M GONNA GET

08:53.833 --> 08:56.067
THIS EVENING.

08:56.067 --> 08:57.300
>> DEPENDS ON HOW YOU PLAY

08:57.300 --> 08:58.333
YOUR CARDS.

08:58.333 --> 09:00.100
>> MMM.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.467
50,000.

09:03.467 --> 09:05.400
>> CALL.

09:05.400 --> 09:13.333
*

09:15.600 --> 09:22.067
>> HMM.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.267
>> DON'T BE SHY NOW.

09:23.267 --> 09:25.700
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

09:25.700 --> 09:29.067
>> ALL RIGHT.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.400
100K.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.167
>> YOU TRYING TO MUSCLE THE POT?

09:32.167 --> 09:34.167
>> WHY?

09:34.167 --> 09:36.133
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT, DEAR?

09:36.133 --> 09:37.933
>> I AM CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT

09:37.933 --> 09:41.100
YOU'RE WORKING WITH.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.900
CALL.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.133
>> YOU GONNA SEE.

09:56.267 --> 10:03.100
150 LARGE, ALL-IN.

10:03.100 --> 10:07.233
>> MMM.

10:07.233 --> 10:11.400
CALL.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.067
>> ALTHOUGH BEAUTIFUL YOU MAY

10:13.067 --> 10:16.267
BE, YOU'RE STILL 120K AWAY

10:16.267 --> 10:20.100
FROM A CALL.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.633
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I EXPECT

10:21.633 --> 10:23.267
IF YOU LOSE, DEAR.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.133
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.433
>> WELL, TAKE ME TO THE RIVER,

10:26.433 --> 10:28.600
BABY.

10:36.233 --> 10:40.867
>> I THINK I'LL JUST TAKE YOU.

10:40.867 --> 10:42.367
>> HMM.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.800
>> [laughs]

10:43.800 --> 10:46.467
>> WELL, WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU

10:46.467 --> 10:49.500
GONNA TAKE ME IN?

10:49.500 --> 10:52.167
FOUR KINGS.

10:52.167 --> 10:53.133
[laughs]

10:53.133 --> 10:58.533
THAT LOOK IS PRICELESS.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.367
AS PREVIOUSLY ARRANGED

11:00.367 --> 11:04.433
AND DISCUSSED, TIME TO PAY UP.

11:04.433 --> 11:08.633
LET'S GO, LUSCIOUS.

11:08.633 --> 11:10.433
I'M GONNA ENJOY THIS RIDE IN MY

11:10.433 --> 11:12.533
NEW ASTON MARTIN.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.267
DON'T LOOK SO SAD.

11:14.267 --> 11:16.200
CALL YOURSELF A RIDE.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.167
[laughs]

11:19.167 --> 11:22.067
OH, CASH ME OUT...

11:22.067 --> 11:23.533
EXPEDITIOUSLY.

11:23.533 --> 11:24.633
>> * DON'T LOOK AHEAD *

11:24.633 --> 11:28.367
* THERE'S STORMY WEATHER *

11:28.367 --> 11:30.367
>> * PARTY

11:30.367 --> 11:31.133
>> * WHEN YOU LOOK

11:31.133 --> 11:32.500
* INTO MY EYES

11:32.500 --> 11:33.600
>> THIS PLACE IS KIND OF OUT

11:33.600 --> 11:34.567
OF THE WAY.

11:34.567 --> 11:35.633
WHAT MADE YOU PICK IT?

11:35.633 --> 11:37.100
>> YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.833
IT SAID YOU LIKED LOBSTER.

11:38.833 --> 11:39.900
THEY HAVE REALLY GOOD LOBSTER

11:39.900 --> 11:40.667
HERE.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.667
I ALSO SAW THAT PICTURE OF

11:41.667 --> 11:42.800
YOUR NEW TATTOO.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.067
VERY SEXY, BY THE WAY.

11:44.067 --> 11:44.900
>> YOU CHECKED ME OUT ON

11:44.900 --> 11:45.600
FACEBOOK?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.500
>> OF COURSE, I HAD TO DO

11:46.500 --> 11:47.433
MY RESEARCH.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.200
I'M SURE YOU DID YOURS.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.333
>> NO, NO, NO, I'D NEVER

11:50.333 --> 11:51.167
DO THAT.

11:51.167 --> 11:52.267
I LIKE TO BE SURPRISED.

11:52.267 --> 11:53.267
>> OKAY.

11:53.267 --> 11:54.300
WELL, HERE'S ONE.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.433
THEY MAKE AN AMAZING CHOCOLATE

11:55.433 --> 11:56.733
SOUFFLE HERE.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.167
>> IT'S MY FAVORITE.

11:58.167 --> 11:59.467
>> I KNOW.

11:59.467 --> 12:01.500
>> TONY, YOU'RE REALLY

12:01.500 --> 12:02.567
THOUGHTFUL.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.233
>> YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

12:04.233 --> 12:05.233
>> A LITTLE.

12:05.233 --> 12:07.200
NO OFFENSE, BUT WHEN I THINK

12:07.200 --> 12:09.233
OF A STAR ATHLETE, "THOUGHTFUL"

12:09.233 --> 12:10.367
ISN'T THE FIRST WORD THAT

12:10.367 --> 12:11.100
COMES TO MIND.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.100
>> AND WHAT IS?

12:12.100 --> 12:12.733
DUMB?

12:12.733 --> 12:13.633
WHORISH?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.067
ROIDED-UP?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.500
>> WOW, YOU JUST UNPACKED

12:16.500 --> 12:18.967
YOUR ADJECTIVES.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.667
I DON'T THINK THAT POORLY

12:20.667 --> 12:21.867
ABOUT ATHLETES.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.433
ACTUALLY, I'M A BIT OF AN

12:23.433 --> 12:24.867
ATHLETE MYSELF.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.433
I RAN TRACK AT PRINCETON.

12:26.433 --> 12:27.900
>> REALLY?

12:27.900 --> 12:29.400
TRACK IS A GREAT SPORT FOR

12:29.400 --> 12:30.267
WOMEN.

12:30.267 --> 12:31.167
AND THOSE PROGRAMS AREN'T TOO

12:31.167 --> 12:32.367
EXPENSIVE FOR THE UNIVERSITY,

12:32.367 --> 12:33.367
SO THEY DON'T TAKE AWAY FROM

12:33.367 --> 12:34.733
MAJOR SPORTS LIKE FOOTBALL

12:34.733 --> 12:37.133
AND BASKETBALL.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.300
>> PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE

12:38.300 --> 12:40.300
ANTI-TITLE IX AND DON'T

12:40.300 --> 12:41.533
SUPPORT FEMALE ATHLETICS.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.667
>> I LOVE FEMALE ATHLETES,

12:43.667 --> 12:45.233
BUT THEY DON'T GENERATE REVENUE

12:45.233 --> 12:46.267
FOR THE SCHOOL.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.300
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO TAKE

12:47.300 --> 12:48.500
MONEY FROM THE MEN'S PROGRAMS

12:48.500 --> 12:49.900
TO SUBSIDIZE THE WOMEN'S.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.133
>> IT'S TOTALLY FAIR.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.400
IT'S VITAL TO PROVIDE EQUAL

12:52.400 --> 12:53.833
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE.

12:53.833 --> 12:54.800
>> AH, THAT'S JUST A BUNCH OF

12:54.800 --> 12:56.333
POLITICALLY CORRECT GIBBERISH.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.067
PEOPLE JUST DON'T WATCH WOMEN'S

12:58.067 --> 13:00.067
SPORTS THE WAY THEY DO MEN'S.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.567
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WENT

13:01.567 --> 13:05.500
TO A WNBA GAME?

13:05.500 --> 13:07.167
EXACTLY.

13:07.167 --> 13:08.733
>> SO IF YOU HAD A DAUGHTER

13:08.733 --> 13:10.133
AND SHE PLAYED A SPORT,

13:10.133 --> 13:11.133
WOULD YOU SUPPORT HER?

13:11.133 --> 13:12.133
>> HELL YEAH.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.233
MY NIECE PLAYS SOCCER,

13:13.233 --> 13:15.267
AND I HAVEN'T MISSED A GAME.

13:15.267 --> 13:17.133
UNCLE TONY EVEN DOES CARTWHEELS

13:17.133 --> 13:18.133
WITH THE CHEERLEADERS.

13:18.133 --> 13:19.133
>> STOP LYING.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.433
YOU CANNOT DO A CARTWHEEL.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.400
>> I SWEAR.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.200
I'LL SHOW YOU.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.633
I'LL EVEN DO A BACKFLIP.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.667
>> NO, NO.

13:25.667 --> 13:26.967
I BELIEVE YOU.

13:26.967 --> 13:27.967
>> SCARED I WAS GONNA EMBARRASS

13:27.967 --> 13:28.800
YOU?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.433
>> NO, I WAS SCARED YOU WERE

13:30.433 --> 13:31.600
GONNA GET US THROWN OUT BEFORE

13:31.600 --> 13:32.800
I GOT MY SOUFFLE.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.333
[both laugh]

13:36.333 --> 13:41.700
[moaning]

13:41.700 --> 13:42.733
>> APRIL.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.233
>> OH, JACK.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.367
YES, OH!

13:45.367 --> 13:46.200
>> DAMN!

13:46.200 --> 13:49.367
IT'S TOO HOT.

13:49.367 --> 13:50.567
>> THAT WAS INTENSE.

13:50.567 --> 13:51.733
>> I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:51.733 --> 13:52.867
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.200
THIS TIME, NAKED.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.667
>> I CAN'T, JACK.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.100
THAT'S MOVING TOO FAST.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.200
>> I'LL TAKE IT SLOW, I PROMISE.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.200
>> I HOPE YOU'RE COOL WITH

14:01.200 --> 14:02.067
WAITING.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.167
IF FOOLING AROUND LIKE THIS

14:03.167 --> 14:04.633
IS FRUSTRATING, I UNDERSTAND IF

14:04.633 --> 14:05.667
YOU WANNA STOP.

14:05.667 --> 14:06.667
>> APRIL, I'M NOT TRYING TO RUSH

14:06.667 --> 14:07.600
YOU INTO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT

14:07.600 --> 14:08.367
READY FOR.

14:08.367 --> 14:09.700
BUT THE LAST THING I WANT IS TO

14:09.700 --> 14:10.733
STOP GETTING THE LITTLE BIT

14:10.733 --> 14:11.567
YOU'RE OFFERING.

14:11.567 --> 14:12.800
>> [laughs]

14:12.800 --> 14:15.067
AND IN THE SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE,

14:15.067 --> 14:17.333
NEXT TIME FEEL FREE TO TAKE OFF

14:17.333 --> 14:19.300
YOUR SOCKS.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.167
YOU HUNGRY?

14:21.167 --> 14:22.067
>> SURE.

14:22.067 --> 14:22.967
WHAT YOU GOT?

14:22.967 --> 14:23.967
>> SINCE I DIDN'T GO TO THE

14:23.967 --> 14:25.500
GROCERY STORE, NOT MUCH.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.900
LET'S SEE, UH...

14:26.900 --> 14:27.900
OOH, I CAN MAKE US A GOURMET

14:27.900 --> 14:29.467
FRIED BOLOGNA SANDWICH.

14:29.467 --> 14:30.600
>> CAN YOU MAKE IT WITH BUTTER?

14:30.600 --> 14:31.900
>> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?

14:31.900 --> 14:32.700
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:32.700 --> 14:33.933
I LIVED ON THEM IN COLLEGE.

14:33.933 --> 14:34.933
>> SOUNDS FAMILIAR,

14:34.933 --> 14:36.333
EXCEPT THE COLLEGE PART.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.400
I GOT MARRIED RIGHT OUT OF

14:37.400 --> 14:39.067
HIGH SCHOOL, SO I NEVER HAD

14:39.067 --> 14:39.967
TO BE ON MY OWN.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.233
YOU HAVE IN THE WINDOW IS WHAT'S

22:00.233 --> 22:01.267
GONNA GET PEOPLE THROUGH THE

22:01.267 --> 22:03.067
DOOR, BUT WHATEVER WORKS.

22:03.067 --> 22:05.333
>> YEAH, THAT TOO.

22:05.333 --> 22:07.100
>> BYE.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.667
>> LET'S DANCE, BABE.

22:08.667 --> 22:09.500
>> OH, I CAN'T.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.533
I NEED TO CHECK WITH THE CATERER

22:10.533 --> 22:11.567
AND BAR NUMBER TWO NEEDS MORE

22:11.567 --> 22:12.233
ICE.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.067
MAYBE LATER?

22:13.067 --> 22:16.067
>> SURE, I'LL BE WAITING.

22:16.067 --> 22:17.667
>> ALL GOOD?

22:17.667 --> 22:20.167
COOL.

22:20.167 --> 22:21.200
>> WHAT YOU DOING LOOKING BACK

22:21.200 --> 22:22.933
THERE?

22:22.933 --> 22:24.667
>> I'M SORRY, THIS AREA IS

22:24.667 --> 22:25.733
RESTRICTED.

22:25.733 --> 22:26.667
AND SO IS SHE.

22:26.667 --> 22:27.700
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROTECT ME,

22:27.700 --> 22:28.533
OMAR.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.067
I'M NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

22:30.067 --> 22:31.067
>> YOU WERE PREGNANT IN HIGH

22:31.067 --> 22:34.167
SCHOOL.

22:34.167 --> 22:35.867
>> [sighs]

22:35.867 --> 22:43.867
*

22:47.667 --> 22:49.500
>> I'M GOOD, RAQUEL.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.067
JUST LIKE I WAS WHEN YOU WARNED

22:51.067 --> 22:52.267
ME THEY'D BE HERE.

22:52.267 --> 22:53.600
>> JUST WANTED TO BE SURE BEFORE

22:53.600 --> 22:59.400
I GO SAY HI.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.500
HELLO.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.133
>> DARLING, YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY

23:02.133 --> 23:03.333
OUTDONE YOURSELF.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.500
>> GREAT PARTY, RAQUEL.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.267
NICE TURNOUT.

23:05.267 --> 23:06.167
>> THANK YOU.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.167
>> HEY, YOU WANT A COSMOPOLITAN,

23:07.167 --> 23:08.067
BABE?

23:08.067 --> 23:09.133
>> I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TRYING

23:09.133 --> 23:10.533
TO INEBRIATE ME.

23:10.533 --> 23:11.667
>> HA.

23:11.667 --> 23:13.467
AS A MEANS, NOT AN END.

23:13.467 --> 23:14.633
BE RIGHT BACK.

23:14.633 --> 23:15.500
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING FROM

23:15.500 --> 23:16.167
THE BAR?

23:16.167 --> 23:16.833
>> NO, THANKS.

23:16.833 --> 23:19.800
>> ALL RIGHT.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.067
>> I SEE THE TWO OF YOU ARE

23:21.067 --> 23:21.867
STILL GOING STRONG.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.633
>> YES, INDEED.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.833
HE'S STARTED TO HINT AT...

23:25.833 --> 23:27.500
MARRIAGE.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.500
>> WOW.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.733
THAT'S A LITTLE QUICK, ISN'T IT?

23:30.733 --> 23:33.067
>> OH, RAQUEL, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY

23:33.067 --> 23:36.667
DEBUTANTS ANYMORE.

23:36.667 --> 23:39.900
*

23:39.900 --> 23:41.933
>> NO, THANK YOU.

23:41.933 --> 23:43.600
>> HEY, PRETTY.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.767
>> HI.

23:45.767 --> 23:46.967
>> AND I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,

23:46.967 --> 23:48.667
BUT I BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS.

23:48.667 --> 23:49.767
THIS IS MY LAWYER, JOHN.

23:49.767 --> 23:50.467
>> HI.

23:50.467 --> 23:51.233
>> AND HIS FRIEND FROM THE

23:51.233 --> 23:51.967
FIRM--

23:51.967 --> 23:52.633
>> SEAN!

23:52.633 --> 23:53.300
>> HEY, RAQUEL.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.067
>> HI.

23:54.067 --> 23:55.067
>> HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

23:55.067 --> 24:00.100
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.967
>> LOOKING GOOD AS ALWAYS,

24:01.967 --> 24:02.933
KEISHA.

24:02.933 --> 24:05.533
>> HEY.

24:05.533 --> 24:06.933
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:06.933 --> 24:07.967
>> I CAME TO SEE YOU.

24:07.967 --> 24:09.067
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:09.067 --> 24:10.233
YOU BEEN DOING GOOD?

24:10.233 --> 24:11.500
>> AH, THAT QUESTION IS

24:11.500 --> 24:12.500
RELATIVE.

24:12.500 --> 24:16.367
>> AH, WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

24:16.367 --> 24:17.500
>> DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

24:17.500 --> 24:22.300
BUT I'M NOT WAITING ANY LONGER.

24:22.300 --> 24:27.500
>> [laughs]

24:27.500 --> 24:29.467
>> RAQUEL.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.533
THIS PARTY IS CUTE!

24:31.533 --> 24:32.900
AND EVERYTHING IN HERE IS

24:32.900 --> 24:33.767
AMAZING.

24:33.767 --> 24:35.833
AND BY EVERYTHING, I MEAN ALL

24:35.833 --> 24:36.600
MY STUFF.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.667
>> CUTE AND AMAZING ENOUGH TO

24:37.667 --> 24:38.900
ALLOW ME TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE

24:38.900 --> 24:39.967
ATLANTA RETAILER FOR YOUR

24:39.967 --> 24:40.867
DESIGNS?

24:40.867 --> 24:41.967
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK OF MY GOWNS

24:41.967 --> 24:43.367
AS MY BABIES.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.067
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE JUST

24:45.067 --> 24:46.467
FOUND A NEW NANNY.

24:46.467 --> 24:49.167
[laughs]

24:49.167 --> 24:51.067
>> WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED

24:51.067 --> 24:52.500
THE KONA COAST.

24:52.500 --> 24:56.500
DIDN'T WE?

24:56.500 --> 24:58.600
MALCOLM?

24:58.600 --> 24:59.733
MALCOLM?

24:59.733 --> 25:00.600
>> YEAH, BABE.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.333
VERY COOL.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.233
HEY, I'M GONNA GO FRESHEN UP

25:02.233 --> 25:02.900
MY DRINK.

25:02.900 --> 25:03.667
DO YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE?

25:03.667 --> 25:08.633
>> I'M FINE.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.700
>> [laughs]

25:10.700 --> 25:12.200
>> EXCUSE ME.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.733
ONE SEC, MAN.

25:13.733 --> 25:14.733
KEISHA, CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR

25:14.733 --> 25:16.900
A MOMENT?

25:16.900 --> 25:19.333
>> UM, DO YOU MIND?

25:19.333 --> 25:20.300
>> NO.

25:20.300 --> 25:22.700
I KNOW YOU'RE COMING BACK.

25:22.700 --> 25:28.067
YOU'RE GOOD.

25:28.067 --> 25:29.567
>> WE'VE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT,

25:29.567 --> 25:30.800
BUT ONCE I START TALKING TO

25:30.800 --> 25:32.167
SEAN, ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S

25:32.167 --> 25:33.333
SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT YOU NEED

25:33.333 --> 25:34.333
TO PULL ME TO THE SIDE?

25:34.333 --> 25:35.267
>> OH, I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT

25:35.267 --> 25:37.100
THAT JOKER.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.133
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT JOKER

25:39.133 --> 25:40.833
WHO JUST PULLED UP IN THE CAR

25:40.833 --> 25:42.500
THAT I BOUGHT YOU?

25:42.500 --> 25:43.767
>> I LOST THE CAR IN A POKER

25:43.767 --> 25:44.500
MATCH.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.567
>> DAMN.

25:46.567 --> 25:48.067
THAT'S BAD, BUT IT'S BETTER

25:48.067 --> 25:49.500
THAN WHAT I THOUGHT.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.633
>> I'LL GET IT BACK.

25:50.633 --> 25:51.733
>> YOU SOUND VERY CONFIDENT

25:51.733 --> 25:52.567
IN YOUR SKILLS.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.067
>> MALCOLM, YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT

25:54.067 --> 25:55.200
MY SKILLS.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.567
THAT'S WHY YOU BOUGHT ME THE CAR

25:56.567 --> 25:57.733
IN THE FIRST PLACE, REMEMBER?

25:57.733 --> 26:01.067
>> MM-HMM.

26:01.067 --> 26:02.367
>> HEY.

26:02.367 --> 26:04.367
AT LEAST YOU'RE BACK.

26:04.367 --> 26:08.600
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.267
>> AND WHO IS YOUR INCREDIBLY

26:10.267 --> 26:11.833
HANDSOME FRIEND, RAQUEL?

26:11.833 --> 26:14.100
>> TONY CRAWFORD, TAYLOR TILTON.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.400
>> HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.800
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON JOHN AND

26:18.800 --> 26:19.800
MAKE SURE HE'S NOT SUING

26:19.800 --> 26:20.633
ANYBODY.

26:20.633 --> 26:22.300
>> OKAY, SWEETIE.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.067
>> I SEE SOMEBODY'S NOT PINING

26:24.067 --> 26:26.133
AFTER VICTOR BARRINGTON.

26:26.133 --> 26:28.067
CANADIAN BALL?

26:28.067 --> 26:29.233
>> AMERICAN.

26:29.233 --> 26:30.600
ALL-PRO.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.933
RETIRED.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.167
I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

26:42.167 --> 26:44.533
BUT DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU THAT

26:44.533 --> 26:45.800
MALCOLM MIGHT NOT HAVE GOTTEN

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
KEISHA TOTALLY OUT OF HIS

26:46.800 --> 26:47.800
SYSTEM?

26:47.800 --> 26:48.967
>> MALCOLM IS MY MAN.

26:48.967 --> 26:50.733
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH HIM.

26:50.733 --> 26:52.833
BUT HE'S STILL A MAN, RAQUEL.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.300
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.167
THE BENEFITS OF BEING WITH

26:55.167 --> 26:56.533
A POWERFUL MAN FAR OUTWEIGH

26:56.533 --> 26:59.867
THE DRAWBACKS.

26:59.867 --> 27:01.533
>> THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS IF THERE

27:01.533 --> 27:02.800
ARE POOR PEOPLE IN AMERICA,

27:02.800 --> 27:04.600
IT IS THEIR OWN DAMN FAULT.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.967
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT WHEN

27:05.967 --> 27:07.067
A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

27:07.067 --> 27:07.967
THE POPULATION CONTROLS

27:07.967 --> 27:08.933
THE MAJORITY OF THE WEALTH?

27:08.933 --> 27:09.800
>> SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO,

27:09.800 --> 27:10.700
TAKE EVERYTHING THEY'VE WORKED

27:10.700 --> 27:11.600
HARD FOR?

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
>> NO, BUT THEY SHOULD PAY THEIR

27:12.600 --> 27:13.500
FAIR SHARE.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.400
OR DON'T YOU BELIEVE IN

27:14.400 --> 27:15.067
THE SAFETY NET?

27:15.067 --> 27:17.133
>> NO, YOUR SO-CALLED SAFETY NET

27:17.133 --> 27:18.500
IS THE REASON THAT WE DEPEND

27:18.500 --> 27:20.067
ON FOREIGNERS TO PICK OUR FRUIT

27:20.067 --> 27:21.333
AND CLEAN OUR HOMES.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.967
MAYBE SOME OF THOSE FREELOADERS

27:22.967 --> 27:24.100
NEED TO GET OUT AND DO SOME

27:24.100 --> 27:25.767
FARM WORK AND STOP LIVING OFF

27:25.767 --> 27:26.767
GOVERNMENT AID.

27:26.767 --> 27:27.667
I MEAN...

27:27.667 --> 27:28.833
>> WELL, THAT'S ONE UNPOPULAR

27:28.833 --> 27:30.200
OPINION.

27:30.200 --> 27:31.267
>> [sighs]

27:31.267 --> 27:33.267
I KNOW HE'S WRONG.

27:33.267 --> 27:35.333
AND I KNOW I'M WRONG FOR NOT

27:35.333 --> 27:36.833
CARING.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.267
BUT THE MAN MAKES ME SO DAMN

27:38.267 --> 27:40.067
HORNY.

27:40.067 --> 27:41.367
>> THE THINGS WE DO.

27:41.367 --> 27:46.933
>> MMM.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.133
>> YOU'RE AMAZING.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.567
LOSING ALL THAT MONEY AND THE

27:49.567 --> 27:50.700
CAR, AND YOU STILL WANT TO

27:50.700 --> 27:52.133
GAMBLE.

27:52.133 --> 27:53.433
>> IF YOU LOSE A CASE,

27:53.433 --> 27:54.867
DO YOU JUST PACK UP AND QUIT

27:54.867 --> 27:55.767
LAWYERING?

27:55.767 --> 27:57.133
I DON'T THINK SO.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.567
HELL, IF I LET SETBACKS STOP ME,

27:59.567 --> 28:01.100
I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD MONEY

28:01.100 --> 28:02.300
TO LEND YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN

28:02.300 --> 28:03.267
LAW SCHOOL.

28:03.267 --> 28:04.233
>> I DON'T KNOW, KEISHA.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.633
A PRIUS IS A SOLID, PRACTICAL

28:06.633 --> 28:08.633
SET OF WHEELS.

28:08.633 --> 28:10.233
>> ALL YOU GUYS ARE LOVING

28:10.233 --> 28:12.167
PRIUSES, BUT NOT ONE OF YOU IS

28:12.167 --> 28:16.167
DRIVING ONE.

28:16.167 --> 28:18.700
SO ARE YOU GOING TO LEND ME

28:18.700 --> 28:20.867
THE 20 Gs OR NOT?

28:20.867 --> 28:22.700
>> MMM.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.267
IF I HAD GOOD SENSE,

28:25.267 --> 28:26.633
I'D CHARGE YOU INTEREST.

28:26.633 --> 28:27.767
>> BUT WE KNOW YOU NEVER HAD

28:27.767 --> 28:28.733
THAT.

28:28.733 --> 28:31.467
DIDN'T YOU MESS IT UP WITH ME?

28:31.467 --> 28:34.233
[laughs]

28:34.233 --> 28:35.233
THANK YOU, SEAN.

28:35.233 --> 28:37.400
>> SURE.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.400
>> THANK YOU.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.067
>> IT'S UNCHARITABLE TO SAY THAT

28:52.067 --> 28:53.467
PEOPLE WHO ARE DOWNTRODDEN

28:53.467 --> 28:54.800
SHOULD JUST HELP THEMSELVES.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.467
IT'S THAT RIGID, CAPITALISTIC

28:56.467 --> 28:57.367
POINT OF VIEW THAT--

28:57.367 --> 28:58.800
>> [laughs]

28:58.800 --> 29:00.400
I'M SORRY, BUT I FIND IT

29:00.400 --> 29:02.167
SLIGHTLY HILARIOUS TO HEAR YOU

29:02.167 --> 29:03.767
SAY ALL THAT WHEN YOU LIVE IN

29:03.767 --> 29:05.333
A PLACE LIKE THIS.

29:05.333 --> 29:06.333
>> EXCUSE ME?

29:06.333 --> 29:07.567
>> IF YOU ARE THAT PASSIONATE

29:07.567 --> 29:09.267
ABOUT REDISTRIBUTING THE WEALTH,

29:09.267 --> 29:10.200
THEN WHY DON'T YOU START WITH

29:10.200 --> 29:11.067
YOUR OWN?

29:11.067 --> 29:11.867
>> YOU'RE DEFLECTING.

29:11.867 --> 29:13.200
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ME.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.833
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIETAL

29:14.833 --> 29:16.100
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COLLECTIVE

29:16.100 --> 29:17.433
WHOLE.

29:17.433 --> 29:19.067
STOP, WE'RE TALKING.

29:19.067 --> 29:20.200
>> I CAN'T.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.633
YOUR LIPS ARE SO NICE.

29:21.633 --> 29:23.133
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

29:23.133 --> 29:24.433
>> WHAT ABOUT THE POOR PEOPLE?

29:24.433 --> 29:25.667
