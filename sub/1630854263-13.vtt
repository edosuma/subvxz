WEBVTT

00:11.879 --> 00:15.649
Aw, our baby broke
up with his fiancée,

00:15.749 --> 00:17.585
and he's out
there suffering.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.652
Eh, he's okay.

00:18.752 --> 00:19.720
He's just waiting for Necie

00:19.820 --> 00:20.921
to come get her stuff.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.490
But he's in pain.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.125
And he looks hungry.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.859
I'll take him a snack.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.528
No, no.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.929
No, no, no, no.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.631
Babe, sometimes you
just got to let a man

00:30.731 --> 00:32.466
be strong and power through it.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.371
Oh, hey. Hey.
Hey, guys.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.707
What's Marty doing
out on the sidewalk?
Yeah, hey, Marty,

00:39.807 --> 00:41.809
what are you doing...
Hey, hey, shh.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.979
He's waiting for Necie.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.249
AW, he looks hungry.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.118
See, that's what I said.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.886
Will you give
the man some privacy?

00:52.986 --> 00:53.887
Yes.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.490
Okay.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.659
Look, this is something he's

00:58.759 --> 01:00.194
just gonna have to go through.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.495
Niecy's here.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.896
She's getting out of her car.

01:02.996 --> 01:06.033
Oh, is he going
to shake her hand?

01:06.134 --> 01:07.135
Oh, no, no, no.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.869
No, it's looking
like a hug.

01:08.969 --> 01:09.670
Oh, no...

01:09.770 --> 01:11.772
It's a side hug.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.208
What? No.
Not the side hug.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.145
That's what you give
your cousin at church.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.580
Oh. Uh...

01:19.680 --> 01:22.683
Uh, N-Necie saw us.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.686
Hey, Necie. Hey.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.321
How you doing?

01:28.156 --> 01:30.358
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:30.458 --> 01:31.692
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

01:34.495 --> 01:37.365
So, how was the drive over?

01:37.465 --> 01:39.600
You know-- trafficky.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.203
Ah. Yeah.

01:44.172 --> 01:47.775
Hey, Necie, we're sure we're
doing the right thing, right?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.310
I think we are.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.579
And there's no reason
it has to be awkward.

01:52.380 --> 01:56.049
Hey, Marty, have you seen this
cursing baby on TikTok? It's...

01:56.184 --> 01:57.585
Oh, damn.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.455
Hey, Necie.
Hey, Malcolm.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.257
So...

02:03.357 --> 02:04.525
The coffee grinder.

02:04.625 --> 02:05.593
You should keep it.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.594
No, no, no, you.

02:06.694 --> 02:07.895
You know I got somewhere

02:07.995 --> 02:09.062
to be that is not here.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.998
Where the hell
are my keys?

02:11.098 --> 02:13.801
Look, I am happy getting
my beans ground at the store.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.269
I mean, I know
I saw them right here,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.405
but, uh, I'm gonna just
to go ahead and walk.

02:17.505 --> 02:19.540
Y'all... Yeah.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.075
I want you to keep it.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.379
And before I forget...

02:25.479 --> 02:27.515
Oh, the ring.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.516
Oh, damn.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.650
Uh...

02:29.750 --> 02:31.118
Where's my other shoe?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.387
You should keep it.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.022
Oh, no, no, no.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.724
Necie, I bought it for you.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.725
It's yours.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.892
You know
what?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.761
I ain't going far.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.964
One shoe was plenty.
I'm gonna just, uh...

02:44.064 --> 02:46.099
hop on out of here. Yeah.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.071
<i>Tina.</i>

02:51.239 --> 02:52.440
Look at this.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.276
The wedding reception venue
charged my credit card.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.311
I left them five voice mails

02:57.411 --> 02:59.480
letting them know
the wedding was cancelled.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.849
Why are they
charging me $10,000?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.785
Calvin, is money that
important right now?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.153
Our son is right next door

03:06.254 --> 03:07.921
about to say goodbye
to the love of his life.

03:08.021 --> 03:12.360
And his poor dad is about
to say goodbye to $10,000.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.663
Well, at least we'll
get some money back

03:15.763 --> 03:16.764
when I take back
this dress.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.131
Ah, that's true.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.700
There's a couple
of hundred bucks.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.171
What's so funny?

03:27.107 --> 03:29.109
Oh, my goodness.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.580
What happened
to your other shoe?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.048
I don't know, Mama.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.485
But things were extremely
awkward over there.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.020
I had to get the hell out,
shoe be damned.

03:41.289 --> 03:41.955
Goodness.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.357
Were they fighting?

03:43.457 --> 03:44.692
No, it was worse.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.560
They were being super
nice to each other.

03:46.660 --> 03:49.397
And then she offered to
give him the ring back.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.098
Well, as she should.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.033
No wedding, no ring.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.134
Why? It was a gift.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.836
That's what Marty said.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.371
And he refused to take it back.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.540
H-Hold on, now.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.008
That-that ring was a contract.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.476
And that contract is void.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.413
I agree. It's like
when you cancel your cable.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.180
You have to give
the company the box back.

04:07.315 --> 04:10.484
Marty is not Spectrum.
He's a person.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.153
And if we hadn't gotten married,

04:13.321 --> 04:14.555
I would've kept the ring.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.190
Who told you that?

04:18.826 --> 04:20.894
Hey, guys.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.196
What are y'all talking about?

04:23.331 --> 04:24.398
Cliff diving. Horses.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.166
Pickleball.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.169
Ah, so... me, then.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.971
Aw.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.173
But we were just
worried about you, baby.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.509
I know, mom, and I
appreciate it, but I'm fine.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.177
I even started
eating again. Oh.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.047
You see that?
I told you he'd be fine.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.382
I wasn't worried at all.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.251
You are a Butler man. Strong.

04:44.352 --> 04:47.087
Well, one bummer is you
guys won't get to see

04:47.187 --> 04:48.722
me and Necie's
first dance.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.391
I really nailed
that paso doble.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.892
Aw.
Yeah,

04:51.992 --> 04:53.961
well, no one got to see Dave
and my first dance, either.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.064
This is a
hilarious story.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.766
Do you want to tell
it or should I?

04:58.866 --> 04:59.833
Go ahead. Okay.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.702
Uh...

05:01.802 --> 05:05.739
Gemma and I had been
practicing our dance for weeks.

05:05.839 --> 05:06.974
And then
we get to the reception,

05:07.074 --> 05:08.909
and the DJ
gets on the mic

05:09.009 --> 05:14.114
and says, "Calling Mr. and Mrs.
Johnson to the dance floor."

05:14.214 --> 05:16.384
And then, get this.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.619
I'm sorry.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.154
Gemma, you go. You tell
them. No, I got it, okay.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.424
Then my mom jumps up,

05:23.524 --> 05:27.395
grabs me and takes
me to the dance floor.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.430
So...

05:29.530 --> 05:31.198
your first dance
as a married man

05:31.298 --> 05:32.566
was with your mom?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.801
Yeah, yeah, you get it.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.868
I-I told you it was funny.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.070
That's not funny.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.508
No, uh, Gemma, tell them.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.411
We have been laughing
about this for years.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.248
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, funny.

05:52.986 --> 05:53.887
Hey, uh, Joe?

05:53.987 --> 05:56.424
Calvin Butler.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.191
I left you, like, 14 messages.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.528
Ah, yes, Mr. Butler.
So nice to see you.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.695
Don't worry
about all this.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.263
It'll be cleaned
up by Saturday.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.965
Actually, uh...

06:05.065 --> 06:08.301
that's what I'm coming to tell
you. We've got some bad news.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.270
My son called off his wedding.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.440
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.342
Ah, thank you.
Thank you so much.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.545
He's gonna be okay.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.447
He's strong.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.015
But, uh, how do I
get my money back?

06:22.115 --> 06:23.350
You put it back on the card?

06:23.451 --> 06:25.953
Is there a check?
Uh, Venmo, Zelle?

06:26.754 --> 06:29.723
I'm sorry. Unfortunately,
if you had read your contract,

06:29.823 --> 06:32.626
you would see that all
payments are non-refundable.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.962
Believe me, I get it.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.965
You know, I'm a businessman,
and you got to protect

06:38.065 --> 06:39.166
yourself from flaky customers.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.701
But my son is no flake.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.370
Yeah, he just realized
at the last minute

06:43.471 --> 06:45.338
that he didn't want
to get married.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.709
I don't think you understand
the word non-refundable.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.479
It comes from the
root word refund,

06:51.579 --> 06:53.714
which means
to pay back,

06:53.814 --> 06:58.819
and non, which means
to not do that.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.588
Ah.

07:00.688 --> 07:03.791
I don't think you understand the
roots of the word ass whupping.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.660
Which comes from the act
of me whupping your ass.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.963
Okay, all right, Calvin, I-I
think he knows what it means.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.499
Look, pal.

07:11.499 --> 07:14.201
You signed the contract,
all right?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.336
The only way out
is through an act of God.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.771
You're a smart guy.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.040
You know what an act of God is.
Like an earthquake.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.710
Oh, yeah, there's definitely
gonna be some furniture

07:22.810 --> 07:25.378
moving around here.
Okay, I-I...

07:25.513 --> 07:27.414
Everyone just calm down.

07:27.515 --> 07:30.117
I-I'm sure there's a way
that we can work this out, yeah?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.852
We already worked it out.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.353
You paid for my venue.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.755
I provided the venue.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.323
Doesn't sound like
a problem to me.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.893
Ooh-hoo!

07:41.028 --> 07:42.696
Ah...

07:42.796 --> 07:45.065
You know what,
Dave? He's right.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.534
I did pay
for this venue,

07:46.534 --> 07:48.602
so I'm gonna use this venue,

07:48.702 --> 07:51.271
and I want everything
I'm being charged for.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.440
But you said
the wedding's cancelled.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.676
Oh, the wedding is cancelled.

07:55.776 --> 07:58.546
But the party?
Oh, the party is on.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.717
What do you mean we're
still gonna have the party?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.753
The guy was gonna
charge me anyway.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.121
Babe,
you should've seen his face

08:08.221 --> 08:09.890
when I told him
we gonna go ahead with it.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.893
Well, it sounds like
you're doing this out of spite.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.662
Uh, yes.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.733
You know the saying.
"Spite makes right."

08:21.068 --> 08:23.070
Yeah, I don't
think they say that.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.673
Okay, look at it this way.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.275
We're gonna take
this sad occasion

08:28.375 --> 08:30.844
and turn it into a celebration.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.646
A sad-lebration.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.618
Okay, Daddy, we're gonna
keep workshopping the name.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.854
But sure. I mean,
we have a great venue.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.355
We already invited all
our friends and family.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.356
Let's do it.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.491
See? That's my boy.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.927
Now, will there be cake?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.428
Eh, I don't think so.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.098
Well, actually, we already
paid for the wedding cake.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.133
Then there will be cake!

09:02.275 --> 09:04.645
Oh, look at you.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.213
You kept the dress.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.082
Yes, I did it for the people.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.819
They deserve to see me in it.
Mm-hmm.

09:11.919 --> 09:15.022
Oh, hold still. Let me
get this tag off for you.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.990
No, no, no, Gemma.
Okay? Don't take it off.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.626
This dress is going
back to the store

09:18.726 --> 09:20.127
as soon as the party is over.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.930
Aw, I know it's expensive,
but you should keep...

09:23.030 --> 09:24.431
Oh, oh, no!

09:24.531 --> 09:27.968
That's got to go back. Mm.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.103
Everything okay, Mr. Butler?

09:30.203 --> 09:33.540
Now, Joe, I believe
the contract calls for

09:33.641 --> 09:35.308
a flight of condiments.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.310
There it is right
in front of you.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.213
All I see
is ketchup and mustard.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.650
No aioli?
No chimichurri?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.552
You can't have a flight
without chimichurri.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.856
I believe that's
a breach of contract.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.058
No, no, no breach,
no breach.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.226
Now get this man chimichurri.
What's wrong with you? Go!

09:55.362 --> 09:56.463
It'll be here shortly.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.566
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.835
Hey, Tina, can I talk...

10:02.569 --> 10:05.706
No!

10:07.007 --> 10:08.676
Get back!

10:08.776 --> 10:11.111
Gemma, get your man!

10:11.979 --> 10:14.014
She is already mad at me.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.849
I've been going around for years

10:15.949 --> 10:18.185
pouring salt in a wound that
I didn't even know she had.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.787
Well, Dave, then fix it.

10:19.887 --> 10:23.757
I'm trying, but I can't
change what happened.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.760
But you can change
what happens next.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.964
You mean...

10:31.064 --> 10:33.033
I don't know what you mean.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.072
Now she's mad at me, too.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.149
Hey, little bro, I see, uh,

10:49.249 --> 10:52.720
I see you out here
all by yourself, dancing.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.854
You sure you're all right?

10:53.954 --> 10:55.355
No, I'm not all right,

10:55.455 --> 10:56.757
because you not dancing.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.491
If you're on the dance
floor, you got to dance.

10:58.591 --> 11:02.429
Yeah, but Marty, Marty,
I'm being serious, little bro.

11:02.529 --> 11:03.731
Dance!

11:09.236 --> 11:11.504
Okay, look,
I'm dancing, all right?

11:11.604 --> 11:12.973
But now you got to be...

11:13.073 --> 11:15.375
you got to be real
with me, okay?

11:15.475 --> 11:16.543
Now, I am your big brother,

11:16.643 --> 11:17.845
and if this is all
too much for you,

11:17.945 --> 11:20.247
let me know and I will
shut this place down.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.584
W-What is going on?

11:24.752 --> 11:26.119
We're dancing, Daddy.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.321
Marty says if you're
on the dance floor,

11:28.421 --> 11:29.456
you got to dance, Pop.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.124
Hey.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.862
All right.

11:34.962 --> 11:38.198
But why are we dancing
with each other

11:38.298 --> 11:41.001
when all these beautiful ladies
are just out here sitting down?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.169
I mean, that one right there

11:42.269 --> 11:44.004
has been eyeing you
for ten minutes.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.339
You mean cousin Yvette?

11:48.608 --> 11:50.677
That's cousin Yvette?
Uh-huh.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.880
Okay, well, maybe not her.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.048
And shame on you
for eye-groping this boy.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.050
I'm gonna tell your mom.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.321
Oh! Yeah. I'm starving.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.856
What do we have here?

12:02.956 --> 12:06.093
Vegan pigs in a blanket with
a cashew cheese dipping sauce.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.795
Ugh.

12:07.795 --> 12:11.098
That is so disgusting.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.971
Marty. Come on.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.206
It's not that bad, man.

12:19.306 --> 12:23.076
No, it... it's not that.
It's just...

12:23.176 --> 12:26.046
This whole day was supposed
to be about me and Necie.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.049
We picked out everything
from the playlist

12:29.149 --> 12:30.984
and the color scheme,

12:31.084 --> 12:34.354
even those disgusting
fake hot dogs.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.391
Now everything's just reminding
me of what's never gonna be.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.829
I'm sorry. You guys just...

12:41.829 --> 12:43.396
you guys just dance without me.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.071
Is he doing a sad moonwalk?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.643
Yeah, because
he's sad, Pop.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.545
Look, you keep saying
that Marty's fine

12:58.645 --> 13:00.848
because that's how
you deal with stuff.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.515
That's not who he is.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.018
You know, things happened so
fast between him and Necie

13:05.118 --> 13:07.487
he barely had a
chance to process.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.489
Hmm.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.690
I guess...

13:10.858 --> 13:13.961
my boy never really
did get closure, huh?

13:14.061 --> 13:15.462
And here I am

13:15.562 --> 13:18.431
turning up like it's
my album release party.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.002
I got to do something.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.736
Hey, hey.

13:23.871 --> 13:24.905
Really?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.374
The bride and groom
cake topper?

13:28.441 --> 13:31.578
I told you the wedding is off.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.246
You paid for the topper.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.615
God forbid you don't
get something you paid for.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.026
Hey, Necie, can we...

13:46.126 --> 13:47.027
Oh!
Oh, whoa.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.628
My God.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.697
So sorry, Mr. Butler.

13:50.797 --> 13:51.899
What are you doing here?

13:51.899 --> 13:54.434
Look, I know
it's weird, but, um...

13:54.534 --> 13:56.269
we're having
a little get-together

13:56.369 --> 13:58.571
and I thought it'd be more fun

13:58.671 --> 14:00.507
for everyone if you came.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.911
Is the party, by any chance,
at the charter club?

14:03.911 --> 14:05.312
It is.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.681
Couldn't get your
deposit back, huh?

14:10.417 --> 14:11.952
Okay.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.720
Yes, you got me,
all right?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.923
I am a cheap man.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.058
But look, I just wanted
to have a party

14:18.158 --> 14:21.094
to get Marty's mind off
what's happened with you two.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.762
How's that working out?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.597
Not good.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.335
But that's
why I'm here.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.670
I didn't realize how
much he was hurting

14:30.770 --> 14:32.940
until the vegan pigs
in a blanket came out.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.942
Did everyone enjoy them?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.609
Mm-hmm.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.681
You know, this day
was supposed to be

14:41.781 --> 14:43.450
a celebration for
the both of you.

14:43.550 --> 14:47.955
And I know Marty would really
be happy if you came.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.492
I appreciate that,
but I just can't.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.761
It would be too hard on me.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.197
Yeah. Yeah, I-I
could see that.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.999
I had to try though, huh?

14:59.099 --> 15:00.767
All right.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.970
Get back to it.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.405
You know...

15:05.505 --> 15:09.242
Necie, I just wanted
you to know that...

15:10.143 --> 15:13.746
...that Marty's not gonna be
the only one that'll miss you.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.648
We all will.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.985
You were
part of our family, and...

15:17.985 --> 15:21.221
we never got a chance
to say a real goodbye.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.895
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.631
Uh...

15:31.731 --> 15:33.366
I'd give you a hug,
but I'm really sweaty.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.435
Oh, it's all good.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.070
I jogged in from
the parking lot,

15:37.170 --> 15:38.671
so I'm sweaty, too.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.178
Okay. Yeah, go.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.714
Go.
Get-get back to it.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.523
Oh! Napkin! Napkin!

15:56.623 --> 15:58.191
Napkin!
Okay.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.559
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:59.659 --> 16:00.760
quick announcement.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.495
If you have
a silver Prius

16:02.595 --> 16:04.031
parked in front
of the dumpster,

16:04.031 --> 16:05.898
you are about to be towed.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.202
And now, please
turn your attention

16:09.302 --> 16:10.637
to the dance floor,

16:10.737 --> 16:15.108
where I present to you
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson!

16:20.247 --> 16:22.049
What? No, you didn't.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.851
Uh, yes, I did.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.587
Get your butt out there!
Oh!

I don't think so.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.799
If you recall,

17:12.899 --> 17:15.435
I paid for the hall
until midnight.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.870
It's 11:48.

17:17.970 --> 17:21.541
You're a smart guy, Joe.
Is that midnight?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.011
I don't like you.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.148
Oh, and I want all
these leftovers boxed up

17:28.248 --> 17:30.150
and put in my truck.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.186
Get this man some damn boxes.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.625
Oh, hey, hey, Marty.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.428
Look, man, I want
to apologize.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.730
I was raised to be hard

17:43.830 --> 17:46.499
and never express
my feelings.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.270
But sometimes being
Butler strong means

17:50.370 --> 17:54.040
being strong enough to
admit when you're hurting.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.044
Did I not tell you that part?

17:58.145 --> 17:59.579
No.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.349
No, you pretty explicitly
said the opposite.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.185
Yeah... Look,

18:05.285 --> 18:06.953
I'm sorry if I made you feel

18:07.053 --> 18:09.222
like you had to
be tough, for me.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.925
Are you okay?

18:13.025 --> 18:14.361
I will be.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.596
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah. All right.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.600
Oh.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.170
Hello.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.338
Hi.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.840
What are you doing here?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.943
Your dad told me the vegan pigs
in a blanket were delicious.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.048
Yeah, yeah,
everybody loved them.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.186
You want some?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.754
Uh, there's a lot left.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.190
No-no, thanks.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.995
How you doing?

18:49.095 --> 18:51.264
I'm okay.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.868
Considering today
was supposed to be...

18:57.670 --> 18:59.306
You know?

18:59.406 --> 19:02.642
Yeah, I know.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.444
It's too bad.

19:04.544 --> 19:09.081
I was really looking forward
to seeing you do the paso doble.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.353
Well, you still can.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.802
Maybe we should
give them a minute.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.505
We can give them exactly seven.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.327
So, Pop, where
do you want this

19:54.427 --> 19:56.463
vegan stuff-- in
the garage fridge?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.130
No, the garbage.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.302
I just wanted
to make Joe pack it up.

20:04.404 --> 20:07.039
All right, the
last of the food,

20:07.139 --> 20:09.609
and I haven't gotten
a speck on my dress.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.645
Hey, Marty,
have you seen my keys?

20:12.745 --> 20:13.880
No, man, I...

20:13.980 --> 20:16.483
Oh, wait,
what is this?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.187
Is that the ring?

20:21.288 --> 20:23.556
Yeah, it is.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.626
Necie must've stuck this in
my pocket while we were dancing.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.161
Well, all right.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.598
What?

20:31.698 --> 20:34.801
The boy don't need to be
brokenhearted and broke.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.507
Mrs. Butler, I must say,

20:40.607 --> 20:43.876
once again, you look
great in this dress.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.945
Well, enjoy it, because this

20:46.045 --> 20:48.315
is the last time
you're gonna see it.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.455
Please tell me that
was your spine.
