00:06.406 --> 00:09.576
# SAM AND THE WOMP: Bom Bom

00:11.444 --> 00:15.782
Bloody Nora, Cancun was crazy.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.684
(all) Mexicano.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.353
Vicky and Ricci had World War 3.

00:21.488 --> 00:23.189
Then he asked her to marry him.

00:23.256 --> 00:24.958
So will you marry us?
Yes.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.093
(yells)

00:27.160 --> 00:30.096
James broke his leg
and broke Holly's heart.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.798
I do have feeling for James.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.535
Me and Holly, it stays in Cancun.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.703
You absolute twat.

00:37.804 --> 00:41.040
I still can't get over
Jay, my best mate, leaving.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.109
I'm leaving Geordie Shore forever.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.878
I'm not coming back.

00:44.944 --> 00:47.547
Charlotte and Gaz,
making up, breaking up.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.816
Don't fucking say things to us.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.619
I love you to bits, you know, Gary.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.053
Bye.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.590
And that was Cancun
and now we're back in Newcastle.

00:58.925 --> 01:00.226
Ding dong,

01:00.293 --> 01:05.598
I've got a boyfriend and
his penis is a Totem pole of worship.

01:05.665 --> 01:08.701
I'm ready to rock Newcastle
once again. Fucking boom!

01:08.768 --> 01:12.372
Jay and Becca have gone and I can't
wait to meet the new people.

01:13.173 --> 01:16.409
If someone puts a dick in your face
it's instinct to suck it.

01:16.476 --> 01:19.646
Oh, my God, I'm gonna be the most
two-faced **** in the world.

01:19.712 --> 01:20.747
Love you.

01:20.814 --> 01:22.148
Useless fucking bitch.

01:22.215 --> 01:24.851
I'm in Gary's bed
and I've got a boyfriend.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.520
I'd like to shit on his face.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.557
Threesome, orgies.
Banging anything in sight.

01:30.623 --> 01:34.294
Jagerbombs and knickers and cocks
flying everywhere.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.730
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:37.797 --> 01:40.467
24 hours a day for six weeks
with these people.

01:40.533 --> 01:41.568
Put your pants on.

01:41.634 --> 01:43.336
It's gonna be fucking mint.

01:43.403 --> 01:46.172
Geordie Shore! Tash on, bitches.

01:46.239 --> 01:47.774
(all cheer)

01:49.676 --> 01:51.845
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.047
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.149
I'd never kiss without a six-pack.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.585
Got the looks, got the charm.
It just works.

01:58.651 --> 02:00.587
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

02:00.653 --> 02:03.423
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.358
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.794
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:19.038 --> 02:21.508
We're back in Newcastle,
our playground,

02:21.574 --> 02:23.343
and that means fucking chaos.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.746
Jay and Becca are gone and I
can't wait to meet the new people.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.049
I just hope it's not another
fucking prick with a parsnip,

02:30.116 --> 02:31.718
banging anything in sight.

02:31.784 --> 02:35.321
We're back. Geordie Shore
where it belongs, the Toon.

02:35.388 --> 02:38.091
It's going to be bigger
and better than ever.

02:39.959 --> 02:41.628
So we're back in Newcastle.

02:41.694 --> 02:45.164
Last time we were in Cancun,
and I got so homesick.

02:45.231 --> 02:49.302
I was a million miles away from home
but now I'm back on me own ground,

02:49.369 --> 02:53.573
me own territory, and I'm ready
to rock Newcastle once again.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.576
I want to get in these states
that everyone else gets in,

02:56.643 --> 02:58.578
cos it looks like so much fun.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.047
And I want to have that fun,
this time round.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.449
But you get really bad hangovers,
Sophie.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.853
Fine, I take two paracetamol,
a pint of water and a banana.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.557
Good for you, darling. You know then,
that's brilliant. Sorted.

03:10.623 --> 03:14.060
Me and Joel,
we have been through ups and downs.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.563
But now we've came a long way

03:16.629 --> 03:18.097
and now I know I'm solid.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.099
I love you loads.
I love you more.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.334
Take care.
Have fun.

03:21.401 --> 03:24.604
I'm young, I'm fun
and I'm full of cum.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.306
Sophie.

03:28.274 --> 03:31.077
We're back in Newcastle.
That means three things.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.112
Bucking, birds and banter.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.015
Oh, here we go again.

03:36.082 --> 03:37.083
I loved Cancun.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.986
Birds everywhere.
I didn't sleep with Charlotte.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.321
She's got a boyfriend.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.957
I can carry on doing what I want,
pull birds.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.859
Is there any good
telling you to be good?

03:46.926 --> 03:49.295
When I've finished partying?
No doubt.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.998
OK, son, look after yourself.
Will do. Be good.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.733
Charlotte's got a boyfriend.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.569
But with me in that house
let's see how long it lasts.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.573
This time around
I'm gonna get mortal,

04:00.640 --> 04:02.909
I'm gonna dance on tables, on chairs.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.778
I'm gonna be sick on myself.
I'm gonna piss myself.

04:05.845 --> 04:10.383
I might even shit myself again but
I'll do all that with a boyfriend.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.652
The parsnip hasn't even
got a look in.

04:12.719 --> 04:15.455
It'll be so weird
being back in Newcastle.

04:15.521 --> 04:18.524
Me and Scott have only been together,
like, two month.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.462
And I know that's not very serious
but I know it's going somewhere good

04:22.528 --> 04:25.865
because when we lie in bed at night
and I fart under the quilt,

04:25.932 --> 04:28.067
we both put our heads under
to smell it.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.303
So that just shows
that he's a keeper.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.206
We'll go downstairs
cos Sophie's gonna be here soon.

04:33.272 --> 04:36.709
I'm looking forward to going back
in the house, a new chapter,

04:36.776 --> 04:38.378
spending time with the girls

04:38.444 --> 04:42.081
and hopefully, sooner or later,
introducing Scott to the family.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.086
This is Geordie Shore.

04:47.153 --> 04:50.056
What this is about
is young people going out,

04:50.123 --> 04:52.759
partying, having fun,
having an amazing time.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.527
Not bloody getting married.

04:55.395 --> 04:58.331
They weren't very nice
about our engagement.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.166
But that's their own opinions.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.503
Suppose. I've got plenty of opinions
about them. Exactly.

05:03.569 --> 05:05.204
And loads of them aren't nice.

05:05.271 --> 05:08.608
They sit there smiling
and being nice to my face

05:08.675 --> 05:11.544
and slagging us off
behind me back.

05:11.611 --> 05:14.547
Being engaged in the house
won't change me and Vicky.

05:14.614 --> 05:18.685
I'll be partying with the lads,
she'll be partying with the girls.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.621
We're still Vicky
and we're still Ricci.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.490
We're separate individuals
with personalities.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.626
Think of your muscles, babe.

05:26.693 --> 05:27.994
I'll wait in the car.

05:31.531 --> 05:35.101
I was thinking, I'm dead keen
to spend more time with the girls.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.904
You're dead keen to spend more time
with the lads.

05:37.970 --> 05:41.074
It would just be such a good idea
if we didn't share a room.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.645
(doorbell rings)

05:45.712 --> 05:48.481
Why aye!
Why aye!

05:48.548 --> 05:51.217
Look who it is.
Ah!

05:51.284 --> 05:55.221
Don't! I'm on my period, man.
Feed the pony.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.557
She's me best friend
in the whole world.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.159
I want us to banter
the whole way through.

06:00.226 --> 06:03.563
I want to do loads of pranks.
I want to do it all the time.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.932
I'm going to cover

06:05.998 --> 06:09.569
Holly's bed in fleas.

06:09.635 --> 06:12.438
Where are you gonna get fleas from?
A flea market.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.808
How's Holly going to get in?
Who cares about Holly?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.376
(car horn blares)

06:17.443 --> 06:19.812
(both) Whoo!

06:19.879 --> 06:22.749
Mexico was a whirlwind of emotions
for me.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.050
I went in and I thought,

06:24.117 --> 06:27.186
"I'm over Gary, I don't have
to sleep with him any more."

06:27.253 --> 06:29.088
Then I realised I still liked him.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.491
I realised
we couldn't even be friends.

06:41.868 --> 06:45.104
I can't wait to get back amongst it,
in the nightclubs.

06:45.171 --> 06:48.307
If there's one thing Geordies
know how to do, it's party.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.645
Oi oi.
How it going? You all right, like?

06:52.712 --> 06:54.213
You ready?
Just.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.450
It seems like we just got back
from Cancun, doesn't it?

07:04.223 --> 07:07.426
Me and Holly. I haven't really
spoke to her since Mexico.

07:07.493 --> 07:11.631
But as I always say, I'm not gonna
bang her, and I mean it this time.

07:15.001 --> 07:18.971
It's not just about sex now.
We've got this amazing relationship.

07:19.038 --> 07:21.340
I need a bigger case.

07:21.407 --> 07:24.277
(both) # Oh, Holly, Holly, Holly

07:24.343 --> 07:26.612
# Oh, Holly, Holly, Holly

07:26.679 --> 07:30.983
# Oh, Holly, Holly, Holly
Red hair, big tits, massive fanny #

07:31.050 --> 07:33.219
(Holly laughs)

07:33.286 --> 07:36.022
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

07:36.088 --> 07:37.657
Are you ready?

07:37.723 --> 07:40.726
Are you ready? I'm fucking ready.
I was born ready.

08:01.881 --> 08:06.018
Here we go again. It's like
going back to the old school.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.854
Home sweet home.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.622
Whoo!

08:09.689 --> 08:10.823
We're back!

08:10.890 --> 08:14.460
Me, Sophie and Holly are ecstatic
to be back in the house together.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.495
Everything looks exactly the same.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.130
(all scream)

08:18.197 --> 08:20.600
Apart from the back garden.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.369
Oh, my days.
Oh, my God.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.605
It looks like a massive greenhouse.

08:26.639 --> 08:29.842
The only thing that's gonna be
growing in this greenhouse

08:29.909 --> 08:33.546
is floppy penises,
turning into massive stiffy ones,

08:33.613 --> 08:37.416
because this is the new place where
all the shagging's gonna go down.

08:37.482 --> 08:40.019
This is the bucking bungalow.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.989
This is unreal. I'm so happy.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.558
Look, look.
Chairs, one, two, three, four,

08:45.625 --> 08:47.360
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

08:47.426 --> 08:52.331
There's two chairs so that must mean
there's two new housemates.

08:52.398 --> 08:55.868
To the memories we had and the new
memories we're going to make.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.403
(both) That was a nice one.

08:57.470 --> 09:01.607
It's going to be a lot different
now Charlotte's got a boyfriend.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.576
I hope Charlotte doesn't change

09:03.643 --> 09:06.178
because I like
Charlotte's personality.

09:06.245 --> 09:07.780
You need that personality.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.416
If she's happy I'm pleased.
She knows that.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.318
And to me not banging James.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.856
Let's just fuck this shit up.
Yeah, fuck everyone, everything.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.824
(all scream)

09:18.891 --> 09:20.626
Down it.
OK.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.197
Err...

09:31.604 --> 09:34.106
(belches) Oh, fuck.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.809
So me, Sophie and Charlotte
are sat on the settee

09:36.876 --> 09:38.744
and I can hear a car door

09:38.811 --> 09:41.580
and I can hear a girl laughing.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.517
What if this is a new person
coming in the door?

09:51.958 --> 09:53.526
The door opens.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.328
(screams)

09:55.394 --> 09:58.864
Gaz and James walk in. I wonder
who was laughing like a girl.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.100
Your hair's proper blonde.
I know.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.369
Like, proper blonde.
Yours is shaved.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.839
I am worried and nervous
at the same time

10:06.906 --> 10:09.041
because although I've got a boyfriend

10:09.108 --> 10:11.377
maybe feelings
will come back for Gary.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.846
How you doing, all right?
Good. Are you?

10:15.881 --> 10:18.384
We're sitting like,
"Who could be next?"

10:18.451 --> 10:20.720
Who is going to walk through
that door?

10:20.786 --> 10:22.054
(screams)

10:22.121 --> 10:24.256
(all scream)

10:24.323 --> 10:26.225
Mr and Mrs.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.494
You look absolutely gorgeous.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.564
God, I'm gonna be the most
two-faced **** in the world.

10:31.630 --> 10:34.533
I'm gonna smile to ya face
and talk behind ya backs.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.537
See how it feels then.
You fucking set of knobs.

10:38.604 --> 10:42.775
Not even Becca's old bed can piss
me off. I'm in such a good mood.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.545
(Holly) Vicky's in with the girls.
Ricci's in with boys

10:46.612 --> 10:49.815
and it's nice to kind of see them
alone and as individuals,

10:49.882 --> 10:51.884
instead of as a couple all the time.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.819
Let's have a fucking class time.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.389
Let's fucking smash it.
Fucking smash it.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.458
How many chairs round the table?
Nine, we counted.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.828
So we're looking at
two new housemates. Two.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.663
We don't have a fucking clue.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.066
(Sophie) We'll have a toast.
Come on then.

11:07.133 --> 11:09.135
Survivors.
(all toast)

11:10.469 --> 11:12.505
All the originals standing round.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.640
There's two new people coming in

11:14.707 --> 11:17.476
and that leaves me
feeling a little bit anxious.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.879
The last person who came in
I'm engaged to.

11:19.945 --> 11:22.815
The person before that
I wanted to bat her all over.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.885
With Jay leaving that means
there's got to be a new guy.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.454
I just hope he's a fucking lad
and not a tit.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.724
If there's new talent in the house,
I've got first dibs.

11:31.791 --> 11:36.028
If you're going to put someone in
to annoy us, just be a total drip,

11:36.095 --> 11:39.698
someone who wants to run after Gary
telling him how cool he is

11:39.765 --> 11:44.136
and how big his knob is and how many
girls he bucks and how he's so cool.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.806
That would get on my fucking nerves.

11:49.909 --> 11:52.244
My name's Scotty T. I'm 24.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.147
I'm a club promoter
from the heart of Newcastle.

11:55.214 --> 11:59.051
I'm a fucking weapon. I grill
more birds than George Foreman.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.386
I'm the man about town.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.255
Everyone knows who I am.
I'm out 24 fucking 7.

12:03.322 --> 12:07.226
# The party don't start
Till I walk in #

12:07.993 --> 12:10.463
All right.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.164
(Gary) Oh, no!

12:14.834 --> 12:17.136
Fucking sound.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.239
He's actually wearing the same.
Hi. All right? Hiya.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.540
This lad's walked in.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.111
All I see is some kid
in the same fucking top as me.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.615
Oh, my God, can anyone cope with
them wearing the same top?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.817
Wearing the same top, man.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.753
Worst person,
but me and him go together.

12:35.888 --> 12:37.623
I think it's not gonna take Gary

12:37.690 --> 12:40.226
very long to work out
that he's met his match.

12:40.292 --> 12:43.028
We need to have a threesome
in that bed with a bird.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.164
Mate, we'll get a foursome.
Yes.

12:45.231 --> 12:49.468
It was so embarrassing to see
them sucking each other off.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.238
We just to have banter
and everyone shake his hand.

12:52.304 --> 12:55.374
They were being inappropriate
and grabbing ball sacs.

12:56.642 --> 12:59.445
Are you in here then?
Aye. I'm in here, like.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.947
Yeah, Scott, you fucking love Gaz.

13:06.785 --> 13:10.756
(Vicky) I think there's someone else
in there as well, Scott.

13:10.823 --> 13:13.325
(laughter)

13:13.392 --> 13:16.662
What the hell does that mean?
It's more like a nightmare.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.665
I, I, I, yeah, Scott...
Dream team, dream team.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.001
Pussy, pussy.
Yeah.

13:22.067 --> 13:25.437
I'd fuck her. Me and you. Fuck yeah.
It's me and you all the way.

13:25.504 --> 13:28.574
As soon as he walked through
the door it was him and Gary,

13:28.641 --> 13:32.178
all, "Me and you, this is gonna be
it." It's fucking ridiculous.

13:32.244 --> 13:35.848
Anyone who comes to this house and
a lad is fucking up Gary's arse.

13:35.915 --> 13:39.985
Down-to-earth lad, he's got banter,
I know he pulls birds.

13:40.052 --> 13:43.489
And I know we can do
some serious, serious,

13:43.556 --> 13:46.592
serious damage in here.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.029
Whoa.
This is turning into a cock fest.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.798
(screaming) Oh, God,
you haven't, you dickhead.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.201
There's already a fucking kick off.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.702
Fucking told you, man.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.470
Gaz just pushed him.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.974
I can see this all ending in tears.

14:02.841 --> 14:05.611
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

14:18.991 --> 14:22.561
We've got eight housemates
and everything's going well.

14:22.628 --> 14:25.097
The banter is amazing,
drinks are flowing.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.765
There's a great atmosphere.

14:26.832 --> 14:30.169
I'm in, I'm the new boy.
I wonder who's going to be next.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.949
I'm Dan, I'm 19, I'm young,
I'm fresh

14:44.016 --> 14:46.118
and I love going out
and bucking birds.

14:47.586 --> 14:50.589
I can't wait to get in,
have a good time with the boys.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.558
It's about pulling mint birds.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.761
If you've no confidence
you're not gonna get anywhere.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.396
Whoa.
All right.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.231
Everyone!

14:59.999 --> 15:01.233
Come inside now.

15:02.968 --> 15:06.205
I don't give a shit what anybody
thinks of us. I am who I am.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.974
If you like it, you like it.
If you don't, do one.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.209
How do you do?

15:10.276 --> 15:15.948
In walks this little skinny lad
and I just think to myself,

15:16.015 --> 15:17.816
"Are you lost, pet?"

15:17.883 --> 15:21.420
"Are you looking for your mam?
The playground?"

15:21.487 --> 15:24.890
You're a member of the dream team
as you have the same top on.

15:24.957 --> 15:26.859
Obviously you're the dream team.

15:26.925 --> 15:29.328
You have three members.
That's brilliant!

15:29.395 --> 15:30.629
Everyone.
Everyone.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.564
Get inside now.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.366
Oi oi, nice top.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.303
Gaz, nice to meet you.

15:37.369 --> 15:38.904
Scott walks in, happy days.

15:38.971 --> 15:42.741
Another lad and fucking hell,
this is turning into a cock fest.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.978
There's ten pairs of balls
floating around right now.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.946
Do you know how much sperm that is?

15:48.013 --> 15:50.916
All right. Nice to see you.
You all right, pal?

15:50.983 --> 15:53.085
I'm Dan, mate.
Sound, spot on.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.788
I thought there was going to be
some fresh fanny

15:55.854 --> 15:58.424
and in walks
just a fucking total fanny.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.894
This is unreal.
It's going to get some use, this.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.530
It's going to be a race to that pad
every night.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.766
Are you gonna get a girl in there?
Yes.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.703
You know what we should do, though.
In all fairness.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.105
We should get a tally chart
just here.

16:13.172 --> 16:17.576
Don't embarrass yourself. I know,
I know. You get us for trying, eh?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.678
Mate, you've been here two minutes.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.814
The last person you want
to challenge

16:21.880 --> 16:23.949
to a banging competition is me.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.051
The new family is now complete.

16:26.118 --> 16:29.888
The new boys.
(all toast and cheer)

16:31.223 --> 16:35.494
# Let's get fucking mortal
Let's get fucking mortal #

16:35.561 --> 16:37.296
Geordie Shore, bring it on.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.799
(cheering)

16:44.603 --> 16:45.771
You look sexual.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.907
Holly is the only single girl

16:48.974 --> 16:51.377
and she's got two new men
to choose from,

16:51.443 --> 16:54.780
but the thing is, I'm convinced
she's still hooked on James.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.415
You can tell straight away.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.077
Go on, son.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.315
Charlotte and Sophie
could do with water.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.527
Dicks.

17:41.593 --> 17:44.930
Oh, God, no, you haven't,
you dickhead.

17:44.997 --> 17:48.133
Dan's got in the hot tub,
he's drinking like George Best,

17:48.200 --> 17:51.637
he's chatting to Charlotte.
I can see this all ending in tears.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.610
I'm in the hot tub with Dan
and I'm mortal.

17:58.677 --> 18:02.214
We're having a conversation
but I don't even know what about.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.250
Me and you get a photo.
Wahey! Look at that.

18:13.725 --> 18:17.429
Vicky comes and says Charlotte's
outside, Dan's grilling her.

18:21.133 --> 18:24.169
If Charlotte's having an argument,
anyone's in her face,

18:24.236 --> 18:27.706
I don't care who, I will protect
her, and everyone knows that.

18:41.086 --> 18:44.456
Me and Charlotte get out the hot tub
and Gaz doesn't look happy.

18:52.664 --> 18:57.369
All right, do not worry,
I'm not gonna smash her, I swear.

18:57.436 --> 19:01.106
Dan, bit of advice, right,
do not come in here

19:01.173 --> 19:04.943
and start even thinking that you
know me and Charlotte, right.

19:05.010 --> 19:07.546
Don't even mention
mine and Charlotte's name

19:07.613 --> 19:08.814
in the same sentence.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.584
At the end of the day, right...
Gary, I'm not going to...

19:12.651 --> 19:16.922
Sit there, sit there. Who said
anything about smashing, man?

19:16.989 --> 19:21.360
Don't even put yourself in the same
sentence as smashing Charlotte.

19:21.426 --> 19:25.264
OK. There's no chance I would try
and smash Charlotte...

19:25.330 --> 19:28.467
No, no, because...
You just put yourself.

19:28.534 --> 19:32.437
Dan! Not on the first fucking night.
I swear to fucking God.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.906
(crashing)

19:33.972 --> 19:35.908
Gaz just pushed him.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.209
I'll fucking kill you.

19:37.276 --> 19:41.280
Gaz, I'm not gonna try and do it,
I promise. Fuck off, fuck off.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.082
Fucking... Fuck off!

19:44.149 --> 19:46.118
What happened there, Gaz?

19:46.184 --> 19:47.886
What happened?
Oi, calm it.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.788
I seen him talk to you then.

19:53.091 --> 19:55.227
How the hell
has all of this happened?

19:55.294 --> 19:58.897
Gary pushed Dan
and I'm just really confused.

19:58.964 --> 20:02.568
He's not trying it on and why
would he be bothered even if he was?

20:02.634 --> 20:04.169
What's he gonna do, stop it?

20:04.236 --> 20:06.305
It seems like
he might be a bit gutted,

20:06.371 --> 20:08.006
he might still have feelings,

20:08.073 --> 20:11.410
cos as soon as Dan said something
about her, boom, kicked off.

20:11.476 --> 20:14.246
"I'm not gonna smash her."
I was like, fucking...

20:14.313 --> 20:18.317
Why is he even talking about
smashing you? I'll smash ya face in.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.719
What I didn't want to happen
has happened.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.922
I've got smashed.
I don't even know what's going on.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.859
Ding ding, first night and
there's already a fucking kick off.

20:27.926 --> 20:30.696
Just a standard night
in Geordie Shore, innit?

20:36.034 --> 20:39.538
I forgot what it's like to be back.
Ow!

20:39.605 --> 20:42.107
You've got one more minute to go.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.145
I'm awful.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.581
The lads are ganning on
like dickheads.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.284
But at least us women,
we still have our dignity.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.753
Sorry! Get off!
(yells)

20:55.320 --> 20:58.023
Fucking wicked first night
in the house.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.725
Where the fuck is Dan, though?

21:04.963 --> 21:06.598
(vomits)

21:10.802 --> 21:14.706
Ready, one, that's right,
two, three, yep, four.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.410
Let's get you upstairs.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.081
Oh, you fucker.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.785
Get yourself to bed, son.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.388
It's like a yo-yo
going up and down the stairs.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.922
Just be sick and go to bed.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.534
Fuck me.

21:42.601 --> 21:46.338
I think it's par for the course.
On the first night of Geordie Shore,

21:46.405 --> 21:48.740
someone makes an arsehole
of themselves.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.776
Welcome to the tradition, Dan.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.349
Let's get mortal.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.684
(cheering)

22:00.052 --> 22:02.087
I'm on cloud fucking nine.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.357
I'm going to vomit all over myself
naked.

22:05.424 --> 22:08.326
(sex noises)

22:08.393 --> 22:11.363
(mimics sex noises)

22:11.430 --> 22:13.999
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:35.287 --> 22:37.856
My head's bangin',
there's spew on me floor.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.825
What the fuck happened last night?

22:41.026 --> 22:43.495
Straight away I'm worrying,
I'm panicking.

22:43.562 --> 22:47.432
The last thing I want is them to have
an impression that I'm an idiot.

22:48.333 --> 22:52.404
My first impressions of Dan
are absolutely fucking shit.

22:52.471 --> 22:54.639
Ooh, I bet you've got a sore head.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.444
I want Dan to fit in.

22:59.511 --> 23:02.781
He was going, "I don't fancy
Charlotte, I wouldn't do that,

23:02.848 --> 23:05.817
blah, blah, blah," and he kept
making reference to her.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.688
What Dan has to realise is that by
talking about Charlotte in that way

23:09.755 --> 23:12.357
he's on Gary's toes.
He's in Gaz's territory.

23:12.424 --> 23:14.459
It was like fucking Animal Kingdom.

23:14.526 --> 23:17.729
I should have gave it a bit of
Attenborough and narrated it.

23:17.796 --> 23:21.533
Could have been worse. Yeah, well
worse. Could have got knocked out.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.437
I feel like total dog shit.
I've got to apologise for last night.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.676
It is nice that he's had the bottle
to say sorry.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.311
I think he learnt a lot.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.749
(doorbell rings)

23:37.816 --> 23:40.385
The doorbell goes
and in comes a Satsuma.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.521
Hello!
Hello, how are we?

23:42.587 --> 23:45.323
Very good. How are you?
Good. I'm fine, thank you.

23:45.390 --> 23:47.058
Oh, wait a second, it's Anna.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.127
Hi, Anna.
Hello.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.730
There she is.
Oh, she's looking sexy.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.599
Right, guys,
you'll be pleased to know

23:54.666 --> 23:57.936
you're not spray tanning
any more bodies in the North East.

23:58.003 --> 24:02.407
I found something that I think
you'll be pretty much at home with.

24:03.241 --> 24:06.878
We're going to a little bit of
training. Massage.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.681
You've got ten minutes.
Quick shower, change.

24:09.748 --> 24:12.384
Meet me back here and we'll start.

24:13.451 --> 24:16.454
One of the jobs they got us doing
is massaging people

24:16.521 --> 24:18.557
but with me being so good
with me hands

24:18.623 --> 24:20.358
it's gonna be a fucking doddle.

24:20.826 --> 24:23.361
(Charlotte)
Somebody needs to be the client.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.897
Obviously this just involves
lying on a bed

24:25.964 --> 24:29.134
getting back massaged.
I'm the volunteer.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.137
Because her legs are apart,
just do a little bit there

24:32.204 --> 24:34.806
to keep her modesty,
so nobody can see anything.

24:34.873 --> 24:38.844
So I'm on the bed and I'm fully
naked. Me arse cheeks out.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.780
How's the pressure, OK?

24:41.847 --> 24:43.748
The pressure's great.

24:46.284 --> 24:47.786
Are you ready, Charlotte?

24:47.853 --> 24:51.223
It's Dan's turn and he's talking
about how awkward he feels.

24:51.289 --> 24:54.426
And I'm like, not by the way
you're massaging my bum cheek

24:54.492 --> 24:55.827
I don't think so.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.929
I'm hoping the oil doesn't get slippy

24:57.996 --> 25:01.166
and his finger slips
right up into my little O.

25:05.604 --> 25:07.505
Me and Soph are at work today.

25:07.572 --> 25:10.508
Anna's told her
we're massaging some OAPs.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.444
I just hope to fucking God

25:12.510 --> 25:15.947
they don't think we're going
to massage any saggy ball sacks.

25:18.049 --> 25:21.019
I thought this was about
having a good time.

25:21.086 --> 25:25.023
But no, I'm massaging old people now.
Cheers, Anna.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.491
Bitch.

25:26.558 --> 25:28.093
We've got to set up the beds,

25:28.159 --> 25:30.562
get everything prepped
for the old couple.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.097
I'm winding Sophie up,

25:32.163 --> 25:35.233
telling her she's got to give
the old guy a happy ending.

25:40.305 --> 25:43.909
Then I look around and I find
what they've got to wear.

25:45.043 --> 25:48.146
Oh, my God,
it looks like a toothpick.

25:54.152 --> 25:57.622
I'm Sophie. James. Nice to meet you.
Roger. What's your name?

25:57.689 --> 26:00.425
I'm absolutely mint at massaging.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.728
I'm about to make this old woman
very happy.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.665
Sophie looks absolutely traumatised.

26:06.731 --> 26:10.735
So uncomfortable. I think it's going
to take her about a week to recover.

26:10.802 --> 26:15.974
I'm massaging this man and I feel
weird and it's making my skin crawl.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.177
But James looks really happy.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.948
Can you just move you legs apart
for us, please?

26:23.014 --> 26:24.783
Yeah, just a little bit more.

26:24.849 --> 26:27.986
He's found himself a right Gilf
there, hasn't he?

26:28.053 --> 26:31.323
That all right for you, Carol?
That's fine, thanks, James.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.825
This old couple
have had such a good time

26:33.892 --> 26:35.627
they're gonna go home and buck.

26:35.694 --> 26:38.029
I feel violated.

26:38.096 --> 26:42.067
I feel like all I want to do
is stand in the shower

26:42.133 --> 26:46.137
for hours upon hours
and wash away all me sins.

26:46.204 --> 26:50.442
I do not want to talk about
that moment ever, ever again.

26:59.918 --> 27:03.722
Tonight it's the first night back in
Newcastle. We're gonna smash it

27:03.788 --> 27:05.924
and we're gonna get dolled
to the nines

27:05.991 --> 27:08.560
and have a fucking mint time.
Let's get mortal.

27:11.863 --> 27:15.767
I haven't been out in Newcastle
for fucking ages. Me neither.

27:15.834 --> 27:19.938
We've got two new boys as well.
Shit is going to go down.

27:20.005 --> 27:23.308
The night is going to be
fucking dog's bollocks.

27:26.077 --> 27:29.080
Last night I fucked up.
Tonight I've got a lot to prove.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.483
I'm going to get dressed up,
looking good,

27:31.549 --> 27:33.585
have a good time
and pull some birds.

27:33.651 --> 27:35.920
(screaming)

27:35.987 --> 27:38.123
(Sophie) # This is how we do it #

27:42.961 --> 27:45.363
To our first night out.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.735
We're at the bar.
I'm confident I'm gonna pull.

27:50.802 --> 27:54.105
I'm good looking, I've got
the banter, I've got confidence.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.544
We're in Spy Bar,
we're having a drink

27:59.611 --> 28:03.148
and I hear Dan say
that he's gonna pull first.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.088
Haway, Dan, we all know
that's not gonna happen.

28:10.155 --> 28:12.490
He has to give it
fucking Bertie big balls

28:12.557 --> 28:14.759
about how he's gonna pull
before Scott.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.895
Now, I'm not a betting woman,
I'm not,

28:16.961 --> 28:19.130
but if I had to put my money
on something

28:19.197 --> 28:21.132
I'd be putting it on fucking Scott.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.772
With Charlotte it's like
we've been through so much.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.909
I do care about her. As much as
she calls me a skinny prick

28:30.975 --> 28:33.611
and fucking hates us,
I know she's the same.

28:41.052 --> 28:44.489
So Gary's telling us
that he's trying to protect us

28:44.556 --> 28:48.560
and the whole argument with Dan was
because he was trying to protect us.

28:48.626 --> 28:52.130
And I'm really, really,
really confused.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.731
Protecting us from what?

28:53.798 --> 28:55.366
I don't need protecting.

28:55.433 --> 28:59.070
I have a boyfriend
who protects me perfectly fine.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.117
Now Charlotte's got a boyfriend

29:12.183 --> 29:15.520
I'm suddenly thinking she might look
very appealing to Gary.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.556
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's got his eyes on the prize

29:18.623 --> 29:19.958
and his head in the game.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.593
Cos he's a player.

29:27.765 --> 29:30.735
We leave Spy and head to Bijoux
and we're so excited.

29:34.806 --> 29:38.176
Straight away, Gaz and Scotty,
they're on the hunt.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.844
They want to find some fanny.

29:39.911 --> 29:43.047
We've only been here 30 seconds.
I haven't even had a drink.

29:43.815 --> 29:47.452
(Sophie) Lasses. Yeah?
I'm on cloud fucking nine.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.788
(Charlotte)
The dream team are going wild.

29:50.855 --> 29:53.925
They're in the crowd,
they're searching for girls.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.227
First night
couldn't have went better.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.831
Straight in there, dream team
just perfectly into action.

30:01.232 --> 30:06.571
If I hear the word "dream team"
one more time

30:06.638 --> 30:09.774
I'm going to vomit
all over myself naked,

30:09.841 --> 30:13.111
lick it up, make it as a drink
and swallow it.

30:14.078 --> 30:19.050
I don't even know where Dan is.
I just feel like he isn't here.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.186
Major disappointment.

30:21.252 --> 30:24.522
All the girls, I wouldn't back
any of them in the National.

30:24.589 --> 30:26.558
First night, the lads have pulled.

30:26.624 --> 30:28.526
Apart from Dan.

30:28.593 --> 30:30.128
Fucking shock.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.398
(Gary) He just set himself up
for a massive fail.

30:33.464 --> 30:36.334
You don't big yourself up first,
you do it after.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.079
So we get back to the house

30:48.146 --> 30:51.349
and the dream team's flirting
hasn't stopped.

30:51.416 --> 30:55.587
It seems like there's a lot of
flanter between Scott and Holly.

30:55.653 --> 30:58.890
Holly, I would definitely like to
steer her towards Scott.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.291
They'd be a great match.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.560
They're both fun,
bubbly and outgoing,

31:02.627 --> 31:04.762
and they don't want
anything serious.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.064
It would be brilliant

31:06.130 --> 31:09.267
and an excellent way for her
to take her mind off James.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.336
See ya.

31:12.370 --> 31:16.007
You've been here five minutes,
you think you know what's going on.

31:16.074 --> 31:19.010
You're totally wrong.
Where's your bag?

31:20.878 --> 31:24.649
No, obviously not.
You're blatantly going to buck.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.085
They're both very easy going
about sex

31:27.151 --> 31:29.387
and both quite slaggy
in their own ways.

31:29.454 --> 31:33.458
# Love is in the air
Der, der, der

31:33.524 --> 31:34.959
# Love is in the air #

31:35.026 --> 31:36.327
So I'm in the front room

31:36.394 --> 31:39.597
and for some reason
Scott happens to have no clothes on.

31:44.269 --> 31:47.772
I got my cock out, she just decides
to suck it. (laughs)

31:48.840 --> 31:53.478
If someone puts a dick in your face,
it's just instinct to suck it.

31:53.544 --> 31:55.713
Therefore I ended up sucking on it.

31:58.216 --> 32:00.018
What was that?

32:00.084 --> 32:03.621
I'm just going to the toilet
minding my own business

32:03.688 --> 32:07.959
and before I get there
all I can hear is... (groans)

32:09.594 --> 32:11.562
(sex noises)

32:13.564 --> 32:14.766
Weird, weird noises.

32:14.832 --> 32:19.337
It sounds like some kind of camel
being stabbed in the eyeballs.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.439
(Holly groans)

32:21.506 --> 32:23.841
This can only mean one thing.

32:23.908 --> 32:26.044
The cock is going to be inserted.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.980
It's the second night
in the Geordie Shore house

32:29.047 --> 32:30.848
and I'm in the toilet with Holly.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.917
(Holly groans)

32:43.094 --> 32:45.029
I'm just going to go the toilet now.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.931
I've been waiting for a wee.

32:51.069 --> 32:53.304
Brilliant way to welcome him.

32:53.371 --> 32:55.273
She'll let him fit in quite nicely.

32:56.574 --> 32:59.844
We're going to get up to
some crazy shit in here.

33:02.246 --> 33:05.083
Oh, my God, Charlotte,
it is massive. Yes!

33:05.149 --> 33:08.920
Obviously, now there's a dream team,
they're straight on it.

33:08.986 --> 33:11.189
Gary is in bed with a hippo.

33:11.255 --> 33:13.524
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:28.606 --> 33:30.375
(phone rings)

33:30.441 --> 33:32.777
The phone is ringing
and it's so early,

33:32.844 --> 33:35.947
I just know these lazy bastards
aren't gonna get it.

33:36.013 --> 33:39.050
I run downstairs
and I answer the phone and it's Anna.

33:40.151 --> 33:41.352
Hi, Anna.

33:51.629 --> 33:53.564
Oh, my God, I've never been before.

33:53.631 --> 33:55.833
I'm going to the races. Yes!

33:57.468 --> 33:59.170
(We're going the races.)
Yes!

33:59.237 --> 34:01.105
Yes! Sophie, I knew you'd love it.

34:01.172 --> 34:05.009
So, today is Ladies' Day and it is
right up all of our streets.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.011
It's a daytime session.

34:07.078 --> 34:10.348
Everyone gets on it,
dressed to the nines.

34:10.415 --> 34:13.251
All I heard was Ladies' Day.

34:13.317 --> 34:16.387
If there's ladies there,
fuck the horses, get me there.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.688
Fucking Ladies' Day?

34:18.755 --> 34:22.092
The fucking birds we live with
aren't fucking ladies.

34:27.165 --> 34:32.203
Holly, we're going to the races.
Help me.

34:32.270 --> 34:36.072
Oh, my God, what the fuck happened?

34:40.143 --> 34:41.145
Yeah.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.716
She's oblivious, she doesn't know
what went on in the toilets.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.425
It's always me
who ends up having sex with people

34:54.492 --> 34:55.626
and I don't know why.

34:55.693 --> 34:58.029
I get uncontrollable
when I'm that drunk.

35:01.332 --> 35:04.168
I keep having
these kind of like flashbacks.

35:04.235 --> 35:07.472
And from what I remember,
I think it was big.

35:08.773 --> 35:12.443
What the hell,
we all thought Gary's was big.

35:12.510 --> 35:13.845
I'm just so glad that now

35:13.911 --> 35:16.814
Holly will probably have
the same size fairy as me.

35:19.984 --> 35:23.454
Holly comes downstairs and
I don't think she remembers much.

35:23.521 --> 35:25.122
I definitely fucking don't.

35:25.189 --> 35:29.026
Slight bit of awkwardness, but
we'll get past it, we'll move on.

35:29.093 --> 35:32.763
Holly's a sound lass and last night
she was just being friendly.

35:36.601 --> 35:39.537
I feel a bit sorry for Dan.
Think he's left out a bit?

35:39.604 --> 35:43.374
When he walks into a room,
I feel like, I feel awkward.

35:43.441 --> 35:46.644
Don't think any of us talk to him
when we're out.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.213
Holly pulled.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.983
(groans)
What?

35:52.049 --> 35:53.417
I dropped Holly in it!

35:53.484 --> 35:58.322
Do you not know what happened?
No. Oh!

35:58.389 --> 36:01.626
Shit, I thought he knew,
he shares a room with Scott.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.528
Why would that not be brought up?

36:03.594 --> 36:05.997
What happened?

36:07.865 --> 36:10.668
At the minute
I feel a little bit embarrassed.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.537
I'm actually not shocked.

36:12.603 --> 36:16.040
If it's going to be two people
in the house, it would be them two.

36:16.107 --> 36:19.610
Holly's a slag and Scott fucks
anything with a pulse.

36:24.448 --> 36:29.554
Everybody knows when you go to the
races you get completely dolled up.

36:30.955 --> 36:33.691
And right now
I look like a crack whore.

36:37.228 --> 36:40.565
Ladies' Day at the races
means one thing,

36:40.631 --> 36:44.769
you get your shirt on,
your blazer, looking dapper,

36:44.835 --> 36:48.039
cos you know there's gonna be
hundreds of worldies there.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.141
# ALEXANDRA STAN: Mr Saxobeat

36:50.207 --> 36:53.945
I'm really excited, dress up,
get pissed and waste money.

37:04.255 --> 37:07.592
# DAVID GUETTA: Where Them Girls At

37:08.526 --> 37:10.962
(Gaz) It's rammed. Girls everywhere.

37:11.829 --> 37:14.265
Sun's out, people are drinking
and I think,

37:14.332 --> 37:16.734
"Why the fuck
haven't I been here before?"

37:18.002 --> 37:19.604
Come on, girls.

37:19.670 --> 37:23.307
None of us know what we're doing,
but I'm gonna take control.

37:23.374 --> 37:26.444
I'm gonna pick the horse
with the lightest jockey.

37:26.510 --> 37:30.014
He's got a canny good uniform.
Sophie picked him. Look at his hat.

37:30.081 --> 37:34.218
Sophie's been picking by name, Holly
picked which jockey was the fittest.

37:34.285 --> 37:37.021
Charlotte closed her eyes
and waggled her finger.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.889
I want the bright blue one.

37:46.831 --> 37:48.466
There's not much science.

37:48.532 --> 37:52.303
You're meant to look at the odds,
but we'll leave that to the lads.

37:52.370 --> 37:53.838
I just want to get pissed.

37:54.271 --> 37:57.441
Everyone at the races
is watching the horses.

37:57.508 --> 38:00.211
My eyes aren't on the horses.
They're on the girls.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.680
Spot two wicked blonde birds
straight away.

38:11.355 --> 38:14.425
We're getting numbers.
We've sorted out the night.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.794
Going perfect.
Dream team working well.

38:28.572 --> 38:30.107
What did he say?

38:35.046 --> 38:37.848
I'm not bothered.
I just wanna be friends with her.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.758
He thinks he can have me when
he wants me and it's not the case.

38:51.996 --> 38:56.734
Ten horses, there's nine of us, we
all put a different horse on each.

38:56.801 --> 39:00.404
(Charlotte) And they're off.
They're racing and mine is so fast,

39:00.471 --> 39:03.708
it's in front and I'm like,
"Ha, my horse is winning."

39:03.774 --> 39:06.644
The race is going so fast
that I can't even see my horse.

39:06.711 --> 39:09.447
It's right at the back,
"Shit, everyone was right,"

39:09.513 --> 39:12.049
my horse totally fucking loses,

39:12.116 --> 39:15.186
you always but the bet on
the horse with the best odds.

39:15.252 --> 39:20.591
In fucking shock, the one that we
don't put on fucking wins. Typical.

39:31.268 --> 39:33.504
I'm about to ring Scott,
me boyfriend,

39:33.571 --> 39:36.640
and I'm so nervous
and I don't know why.

39:52.189 --> 39:55.326
I've done nothing wrong,
I've got nothing to worry about,

39:55.392 --> 39:57.428
it's the fact
I'm not missing him yet.

40:06.604 --> 40:10.674
Tonight it's one of the biggest
nights in Newcastle. Riverside.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.646
Haven't been there for a long time

40:15.713 --> 40:19.116
It'll be good to get back into
the swing and get fucking mortal.

40:19.183 --> 40:21.652
All we wanna do
is just get back on it.

40:33.864 --> 40:37.835
We get into the club,
it's bouncing, it's packed.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.440
Obviously, now there's a dream team,
straight on it.

40:43.507 --> 40:47.478
Met this girl, massive tits
and I was just like,

40:47.545 --> 40:51.215
"Fucking hell, like,
I wanna get my face in them."

40:51.282 --> 40:53.417
Gaz sees that she's got a friend.

40:53.484 --> 40:56.487
Gaz was like, "Right,
I'm gonna go with her mate."

40:56.554 --> 40:58.823
And then obviously it's all sorted.

40:58.889 --> 41:04.094
Dan, how the fuck is he supposed
to pull when he doesn't speak?

41:04.161 --> 41:07.164
All he does is stand around and pout.

41:13.370 --> 41:16.106
I know the others
are thinking that I can't pull.

41:16.173 --> 41:18.776
But you know what, you can fuck off,
I do pull.

41:19.944 --> 41:24.648
Needs to relax, pick a girl,
talk to her, graft her and pull her.

41:28.185 --> 41:31.255
I have to tell the lasses
what I've been dying to tell them.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.324
I want you to be me bridesmaids.

41:33.390 --> 41:36.894
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna cry!

41:36.961 --> 41:38.896
She says we can be bridesmaids!

41:38.963 --> 41:39.997
I can't believe it.

41:40.064 --> 41:43.901
For a second I start to cry cos I
feel like I'm getting married meself.

41:43.968 --> 41:47.738
(all chant)
Bridesmaids! Bridesmaids Bridesmaids!

41:47.805 --> 41:52.877
These three, dopey, slutty
and vulgar are my bridesmaids.

42:00.150 --> 42:02.553
Baby, baby, baby,
let's get your pants on.

42:08.525 --> 42:11.695
Second night again,
mint work by the dream team.

42:11.762 --> 42:14.064
We've got a couple of birds back.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.402
Hello!

42:18.469 --> 42:20.304
I cannot believe my eyes.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.173
Gary is in bed with a hippo.

42:26.744 --> 42:29.613
She ran in three times,
what's all that about?

42:34.919 --> 42:37.254
Why's Charlotte in my room
giving me shit?

42:37.321 --> 42:40.157
I thought if she got a boyfriend
this would go away.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.894
Wingman, wingman a fucking gremlin.

42:46.964 --> 42:48.265
I'm not bothered.

42:48.332 --> 42:51.402
She's not bothered
about Gaz whatsoever.

42:51.468 --> 42:55.005
Am I still getting beef,
off someone that's got a boyfriend?

42:55.072 --> 42:57.007
Is this me or am I tripping here?

42:57.074 --> 43:00.344
Am I tripping
or am I still getting beef?

43:00.411 --> 43:04.214
What the fuck is Charlotte doing?
She's got a boyfriend. I can't win.

43:04.281 --> 43:06.450
Fuck this, I'm going back
to the shag pad.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.519
Wanna know how my team-mate's doing,

43:08.585 --> 43:10.988
over to bucking bungalow
and we both get in.

43:11.055 --> 43:13.090
Why not? This is Geordie Shore.

43:13.157 --> 43:17.628
It's been a long time
since it's been me, two birds

43:17.695 --> 43:20.097
and another lad in that bed.

43:20.164 --> 43:24.501
They're in the middle kissing each
other, me and Gaz high fiving.

43:24.568 --> 43:25.803
Fucking mint.

43:25.869 --> 43:29.573
If Charlotte thinks she's gonna
ruin this, she can fuck off.

43:34.244 --> 43:36.680
It's Vicky and Ricci's
engagement party.

43:36.747 --> 43:39.350
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

43:41.552 --> 43:43.220
It's going fucking amazing.

43:43.287 --> 43:45.456
Should be no kick offs whatsoever.

43:45.522 --> 43:46.523
(shouting)

43:46.590 --> 43:49.093
Vagina!
I fucking hate her.

43:49.159 --> 43:51.729
I've done fuck all wrong!
(glass smashes)

43:51.795 --> 43:54.064
Engagement party's
been a fucking joke!
