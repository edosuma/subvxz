00:01.910 --> 00:02.984
-Narrator: Tonight...
-Divers in the water.

00:03.078 --> 00:04.503
...On<i> beyond oak island...</i>

00:05.231 --> 00:06.730
Rebecca simon:
Samuel bellamy became

00:06.823 --> 00:08.490
One of the most successful
pirates of the time.

00:08.584 --> 00:11.844
This is the only verified
pirate treasure in the world.

00:12.071 --> 00:14.588
Simon:
His ship, the<i> whydah,</i>
was the most powerful

00:14.682 --> 00:18.075
And the wealthiest of all ships
to sail throughout the world.

00:18.093 --> 00:20.335
Matty:
People have estimated what
you've collected so far,

00:20.429 --> 00:22.187
It might be worth $400 million.

00:22.414 --> 00:23.981
-We haven't found
the mother lode yet.
-Wow.

00:28.011 --> 00:30.437
-Love it. Sing, baby, sing.
-(laughs)

00:30.589 --> 00:32.948
-What is that?
-Wow.

00:35.018 --> 00:36.702
All the while
we were growing up,

00:36.853 --> 00:39.872
My brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.023
Rick:
Pirate treasure,

00:42.043 --> 00:43.617
Cursed treasure.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.693
Civil war gold.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.455
-(laughter)
-since then,
our work on oak island

00:48.607 --> 00:50.774
Has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:50.867 --> 00:53.777
-Whoa.
-...Waiting to be explored.

00:53.796 --> 00:56.630
Rick:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:56.782 --> 00:58.965
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.226
-Marty: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

01:01.453 --> 01:03.637
-...And share our insights.
-"ill-gotten gains."

01:03.789 --> 01:05.138
-Rick: And who knows...
-Gary: I got it.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.957
...Maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:07.050 --> 01:08.475
Marty:
Not only in america.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.385
Wow. That is gold.

01:10.479 --> 01:12.220
-Rick: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:12.239 --> 01:13.906
Marty:
<i> Beyond oak island.</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.640
Matty: Well, guys,
welcome to my backyard.

01:23.659 --> 01:24.566
Cape cod.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.659
Glad to be here.

01:25.811 --> 01:27.235
Glad to be back, buddy.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.662
I think this is
a great opportunity for us

01:28.814 --> 01:30.238
To show the world
the incredible history

01:30.257 --> 01:32.316
That lies just off this shore.

01:32.409 --> 01:35.319
Narrator:
In cape cod, massachusetts,

01:35.412 --> 01:39.005
Rick lagina and new England
native matty blake

01:39.100 --> 01:42.826
Join diver tony sampson for
a new and exciting adventure.

01:42.919 --> 01:45.162
They are on their way
to meet tony's friends,

01:45.180 --> 01:49.441
Renowned salvage divers
barry and brandon clifford,

01:49.593 --> 01:51.001
To assist
in their ongoing efforts

01:51.094 --> 01:53.353
Of recovering artifacts
and valuables

01:53.447 --> 01:56.523
Connected to the legendary
18th century pirate wreck

01:56.617 --> 01:58.283
Known as the<i> whydah.</i>

01:58.435 --> 02:00.360
Tony, I want to thank you.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.770
I'm sure matty does, too,
for setting this up.

02:02.865 --> 02:04.181
Well, thanks, guys.

02:04.274 --> 02:06.350
I mean I'm just so happy
you're down here.

02:06.368 --> 02:09.444
And, you know,
in my selfish little mind,

02:09.538 --> 02:12.947
I-I'm just fizzing
at the opportunity

02:13.041 --> 02:15.116
To-to dive the<i> whydah</i> as well.

02:15.136 --> 02:18.545
Matty:
This wreck, the<i> whydah,</i>
is so iconic,

02:18.639 --> 02:22.048
And this team's already
pulled up a lot of artifacts,

02:22.143 --> 02:23.958
So that's always exciting, too,
when you know

02:24.052 --> 02:26.294
That they've done it before.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.129
There's precedent here,
we're gonna see something.

02:28.223 --> 02:29.539
Tony:
Definitely, matty.

02:29.558 --> 02:31.483
I really love this story.

02:31.710 --> 02:34.211
You know, I read
barry clifford's book years ago

02:34.304 --> 02:36.989
On the details
of recovering the<i> whydah,</i>

02:37.216 --> 02:39.733
And the whole story
of the captain of the ship,

02:39.885 --> 02:41.326
"black sam" bellamy.

02:41.553 --> 02:42.494
Yeah, I think we're gonna
learn a lot of things.

02:44.072 --> 02:47.557
Narrator:
During the golden age of piracy
in the americas,

02:47.651 --> 02:51.319
Which took place
from 1650 to 1726,

02:51.338 --> 02:54.489
Black sam bellamy, an englishman

02:54.508 --> 02:56.750
Known for
his dark, flowing hair,

02:56.844 --> 03:00.737
Was one of the most notorious
buccaneers on the high seas.

03:00.756 --> 03:02.406
Simon:
Samuel bellamy became

03:02.499 --> 03:03.849
One of the most successful
pirates of the time.

03:04.076 --> 03:07.168
He would capture
over 50 ships in his career.

03:07.262 --> 03:08.854
One of the big trends of piracy

03:09.005 --> 03:11.690
That the pirate
samuel bellamy started

03:11.841 --> 03:15.343
Was defeating their victims
through intimidation,

03:15.437 --> 03:17.754
Rather than actually
killing people.

03:17.847 --> 03:20.515
He and his men
would charge onto ships

03:20.534 --> 03:22.926
Completely naked
brandishing their weapons.

03:22.945 --> 03:25.037
And people would be
so shocked by this,

03:25.264 --> 03:27.539
That they would surrender
almost immediately.

03:28.617 --> 03:32.544
Narrator:
In early 1717,
black sam bellamy

03:32.696 --> 03:35.530
Made his greatest conquest
when he and his crew

03:35.624 --> 03:39.200
Commandeered the english slave
ship known as the<i> whydah gally.</i>

03:39.294 --> 03:41.778
Simon:
The<i> whydah</i> was the most
powerful and the wealthiest

03:41.797 --> 03:44.056
Of all slaving ships to sail

03:44.207 --> 03:45.474
Throughout the world
at that time.

03:47.953 --> 03:51.788
It was 110 feet long
and weighed about 300 tons.

03:51.807 --> 03:54.124
Along with all the goods
that the<i> whydah</i> contained,

03:54.217 --> 03:57.218
It also had gold
and silver packed away

03:57.312 --> 03:59.646
In 50-pound bags
all throughout the ship.

03:59.798 --> 04:04.301
Narrator:
The<i> whydah</i> was also carrying
approximately 50 african slaves,

04:04.319 --> 04:07.895
Whom captain bellamy
immediately emancipated.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.250
He also offered them
membership on his crew

04:11.401 --> 04:13.994
With equal shares
of compensation

04:14.146 --> 04:16.255
And voting rights
regarding operations.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.648
They all accepted.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.835
Simon:
Black sam bellamy was known
as the robin hood of the sea,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.671
And this is because he really
made a huge effort to make sure

04:24.823 --> 04:26.840
That every single person
in his crew

04:26.934 --> 04:28.508
Very much got their equal share.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.768
Not just people in the crew,

04:29.919 --> 04:32.178
But even people
that he captured.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.273
He-he wanted to make sure
that they were treated well

04:34.424 --> 04:35.357
And would get their share.

04:37.336 --> 04:39.111
Narrator:
As the captain of the<i> whydah,</i>

04:39.338 --> 04:43.115
Black sam bellamy made his
way north toward massachusetts

04:43.342 --> 04:45.933
Plundering an astounding
54 additional merchant

04:46.028 --> 04:48.120
And pirate ships along the way.

04:48.271 --> 04:52.440
Simon:
It is estimated that the<i> whydah</i>
carried five tons of gold,

04:52.534 --> 04:54.534
Silver and various jewels,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.110
Making black sam bellamy

04:56.130 --> 04:58.855
Probably the wealthiest
pirate in history.

04:58.874 --> 05:01.374
Narrator:
But as the<i> whydah</i>
approached cape cod

05:01.527 --> 05:05.804
On April 26, 1717,
tragedy struck

05:06.031 --> 05:09.957
As a violent nor'easter
devastated the ship.

05:10.052 --> 05:13.645
Simon:
The<i> whydah</i> ended up crashing
onto the coastline of cape cod.

05:13.797 --> 05:17.541
Almost immediately,
the ship completely capsized,

05:17.634 --> 05:19.467
Because it broke
into loads of pieces.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.711
When it broke into
all these pieces,

05:21.730 --> 05:23.897
Many of the pirates on the ship

05:23.991 --> 05:25.640
Were either killed instantly,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.551
Or they were severely injured,
and drowned.

05:27.569 --> 05:32.072
All but two of the<i> whydah's</i>
146-man crew

05:32.166 --> 05:36.335
Perished in the disaster,
including black sam himself.

05:37.563 --> 05:39.896
The scattered remains
of the ship

05:39.989 --> 05:42.065
Sank in the waters
off of cape cod

05:42.158 --> 05:45.569
And would be lost
for more than two centuries

05:45.587 --> 05:49.514
Until explorer barry clifford
and his team discovered them.

05:49.666 --> 05:53.000
Matty:
I'm excited, guys. And I think
we're coming up on it.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.246
Yep, this is the research center
here, right on the left, mate.

05:56.264 --> 06:00.083
Matty:
This one is very special
for me, this adventure,

06:00.176 --> 06:03.010
Because I'm about to meet
two legends around here,

06:03.105 --> 06:04.754
Barry and brandon clifford.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.347
Growing up around here,

06:06.367 --> 06:08.349
It's hard not to hear
about the<i> whydah,</i>

06:08.369 --> 06:10.093
But I didn't know the details,

06:10.186 --> 06:12.019
And I'm really looking forward
to meeting them.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.689
Good morning, guys.
Good to see you again, barry.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.375
Hey. Good morning. How are
you there, young fella?

06:16.602 --> 06:18.377
-Good to see you again, brandon.
-Hey tony, nice to see you.

06:18.604 --> 06:19.861
Rick:
Barry clifford
and his son brandon

06:19.955 --> 06:21.713
Have committed
literally their lives

06:21.940 --> 06:24.365
To this endeavor
and they're not here

06:24.385 --> 06:26.776
Just because there's
treasure on the seafloor.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.536
They're here
to retrieve that story

06:28.555 --> 06:30.204
Which has been lost for so long.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.723
That's inspirational.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.558
-Barry.
-Barry: Howdy.

06:33.785 --> 06:35.135
That gentleman speaks highly
of both of you.

06:35.287 --> 06:36.119
Wow.

06:36.212 --> 06:38.230
Most impressed to meet you, sir.

06:38.381 --> 06:39.956
-How much did he pay you?
-I told li... I told lies.

06:40.049 --> 06:42.292
(laughter)

06:42.385 --> 06:43.977
Barry:
I'm barry clifford,
I'm an explorer.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.386
I grew up on the cape,

06:45.480 --> 06:46.963
So, it was always, you know,

06:47.056 --> 06:49.390
Exploring,
looking for things, and

06:49.410 --> 06:51.801
As a kid, I used to sit around
the old fish shack,

06:51.895 --> 06:54.320
And listen to the stories
they would tell.

06:54.473 --> 06:57.416
And the<i> whydah</i> was a story that
sort of resonated in my mind.

06:57.567 --> 06:59.492
Brandon:
I'm brandon clifford.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.995
The<i> whydah</i> was really
a folktale on the cape

07:02.089 --> 07:04.648
That had become this, like, myth

07:04.741 --> 07:06.240
And, you know, there were
stories of coins

07:06.334 --> 07:07.575
That washed up on the beach.

07:07.669 --> 07:09.486
And my dad was a cape codder

07:09.579 --> 07:10.987
And he heard all these stories

07:11.080 --> 07:13.173
And it inspired him
to go search.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.601
Narrator:
In 1982, barry,

07:16.753 --> 07:20.772
Along with his friend and fellow
adventurer john f. Kennedy jr.,

07:20.924 --> 07:23.667
Discovered a survey map
of the original wreck site

07:23.760 --> 07:28.447
Created in 1718 by cartographer
cyprian southack,

07:28.598 --> 07:31.508
And began a quest
to bring the story of black sam

07:31.526 --> 07:34.027
And the<i> whydah</i> back to life.

07:34.121 --> 07:38.606
Barry:
In '85, we discovered
this large concretion

07:38.700 --> 07:41.685
With what appeared to be a bell
sticking out of the side of it.

07:41.703 --> 07:43.444
We brought it back
to our laboratory,

07:43.464 --> 07:46.039
The letter "w" pops up
and then "h"

07:46.133 --> 07:49.968
And the y-d-a-h. 1716.

07:50.119 --> 07:53.379
It said
"the whydah gally, 1716."

07:53.474 --> 07:55.289
So, then that was the front
page of<i> the new york times.</i>

07:55.383 --> 07:57.458
My phone never stopped ringing.

07:57.552 --> 08:02.463
Narrator:
Ever since that fateful
discovery in 1985,

08:02.557 --> 08:05.650
Barry clifford obtained
the exclusive salvage rights

08:05.802 --> 08:08.970
To the<i> whydah's</i> wreckage and has
continued recovering artifacts

08:08.989 --> 08:12.065
And valuables in the waters
off cape cod.

08:12.159 --> 08:16.402
Although john f. Kennedy jr.,
along with his wife carolyn,

08:16.555 --> 08:21.649
Tragically passed away in 1999,
barry's son brandon

08:21.668 --> 08:24.652
Works tirelessly beside him
in the effort.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.339
To date, they have found
more than

08:27.490 --> 08:31.751
100,000 artifacts, valuables
and even human remains

08:31.903 --> 08:33.595
Related to the<i> whydah.</i>

08:34.497 --> 08:35.572
This is great.

08:35.590 --> 08:36.848
So, uh, is this the lab

08:37.000 --> 08:38.575
And where you kind of
take care of

08:38.668 --> 08:40.334
The items that you bring up
from the<i> whydah?</i>

08:40.428 --> 08:42.078
-Yes.
-Brandon: Yep, that's correct.

08:42.097 --> 08:43.688
So, we recover material
from the<i> whydah</i>

08:43.915 --> 08:46.024
And it's brought back here
where our conservators

08:46.251 --> 08:49.769
-Then put it through
a process of conservation.
-Wow.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.089
And then we have two museums and
we're building a third museum

08:53.108 --> 08:55.182
And that's the essence
of what we do.

08:55.277 --> 08:57.093
We display the artifacts
that we bring up

08:57.112 --> 08:58.778
For educational purposes.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.446
And we've kept the entire
collection together.

09:00.599 --> 09:01.781
We don't sell anything.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.875
That's incredible.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.952
-So, are we allowed
to see some of this stuff?
-Absolutely.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.546
You should come back here
and have a look at some of this.

09:07.697 --> 09:10.106
Let's see it.

09:10.199 --> 09:11.941
Wow, this is fantastic, guys.

09:12.035 --> 09:14.444
I love the array of cannon
right there.

09:14.537 --> 09:16.296
-Matty: Oh, no way.
-Rick: Beautiful.

09:16.448 --> 09:18.557
Tony:
So, what was it?
62 cannon you pulled off this?

09:18.784 --> 09:20.392
We found 61.

09:20.619 --> 09:22.802
-61?
-Yeah, we've brought
up 50, I think.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.470
-Wow.
-Wow.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.639
-There's 11 still
buried offshore.
-Incredible.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.718
Barry:
Some of these cannons
were antiques in 1717.

09:30.812 --> 09:32.128
-Matty: Wow.
-Tony: Wow.

09:32.221 --> 09:33.630
This is the way you
see them now,

09:33.648 --> 09:35.890
But this cannon right here,
for example,

09:35.984 --> 09:38.968
This is what cannons look
like when we first find them.

09:38.987 --> 09:42.155
In this one, you can see it has
a gun door from the ship

09:42.249 --> 09:44.657
Still concreted to the cannon

09:44.810 --> 09:47.752
With a variety
of other artifacts

09:47.904 --> 09:50.163
All fused into the cannon.

09:50.315 --> 09:52.424
And that's what a concretion
looks like.

09:52.651 --> 09:55.985
Narrator:
Concretions are hardened
conglomerations

09:56.079 --> 09:59.080
Created over time
when iron artifacts corrode

09:59.099 --> 10:02.175
In salt water
and collect nearby objects.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.086
Should we go discuss the
dive plan in the meeting room?

10:05.180 --> 10:06.012
-Yeah.
-Sounds fantastic.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.254
I would love that.

10:07.349 --> 10:09.924
Matty:
This is incredible, guys.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.277
We're going over
the dive plan now,

10:12.504 --> 10:15.839
Uh, we're all anxious to get
out there and see this treasure.

10:15.932 --> 10:17.115
We want to see treasure,
we want to see artifacts,

10:17.266 --> 10:18.842
And that's why we're here.

10:18.935 --> 10:20.785
You know, we can actually
see some of this surface

10:21.012 --> 10:24.180
For the first time ever since
it went down in the 1700s.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.791
These are some of the coins
that we've found

10:27.018 --> 10:30.778
And, um, a stack of them,
eight reales.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.539
They're all
in pretty good condition.

10:33.692 --> 10:34.949
They called it a sock roll.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.526
They'd roll them up
in a sock, like a wallet.

10:36.544 --> 10:37.302
-Rick: Wow.
-Matty: Perfect, yeah, yeah.

10:38.880 --> 10:39.879
Wow.

10:41.216 --> 10:45.793
Matty:
You know, when I see this,
I can't help but think of value.

10:45.887 --> 10:47.370
And I just want to be clear,

10:47.463 --> 10:49.372
That's not what drives us,
but I mean,

10:49.391 --> 10:51.483
Coins equals treasure in a way.

10:51.634 --> 10:54.819
And so, what you've collected
so far,

10:54.971 --> 10:56.804
Your vast collection that
some people have estimated

10:56.898 --> 10:59.306
It might be worth $400 million.

10:59.401 --> 11:00.733
What do you think of that?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.309
I have no idea.

11:02.404 --> 11:03.720
You don't context it like that?

11:03.813 --> 11:05.405
I don't think of it
like that, no.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.315
I mean, I know that
<i> the wall street journal</i>

11:08.410 --> 11:10.651
And some of the other people

11:10.745 --> 11:12.820
Estimated it be worth
$400 million.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.839
Um, and that was 40 years ago.

11:15.066 --> 11:16.490
Mm-hmm.

11:16.510 --> 11:20.011
In terms of the-the
so-called mother lode,

11:20.163 --> 11:21.254
We haven't found that yet.

11:21.406 --> 11:22.238
Wow.

11:22.331 --> 11:24.832
So, we'll probably pick up right

11:24.851 --> 11:26.743
Where we left off last season.

11:26.836 --> 11:29.854
Go back to the same location
towards the beach.

11:30.081 --> 11:32.932
We've located a new cannon,
a small cannon,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.027
Uh, that we believe was kept
on the stern of the<i> whydah.</i>

11:36.179 --> 11:38.530
-We believe we-we're on
the trail of the stern.
-Oh, wow.

11:38.757 --> 11:40.440
Brandon:
The stern section is, you know,

11:40.592 --> 11:41.925
Where the captain's quarters

11:42.018 --> 11:43.702
And the officer quarters
would've been.

11:43.929 --> 11:46.112
And if we're able to find
the area where

11:46.264 --> 11:48.540
That section
of the wreck rested,

11:48.767 --> 11:51.451
You would find
significant artifacts.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.361
Things that bellamy had,
himself, in his cabin.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.864
So, weather provided,

11:56.883 --> 11:59.384
We'll head out the inlet
and head up the cape coast

11:59.535 --> 12:02.887
To the<i> whydah</i> site, inshore from
the main point of the shipwreck.

12:03.114 --> 12:05.706
Then we'll, uh, set up
our grids under water

12:05.726 --> 12:08.284
With the assistance
of tony, and we'll go to work.

12:08.377 --> 12:10.620
All right, well,
as we've said before,

12:10.713 --> 12:12.121
Talk is wonderful,
but let's get going.

12:12.215 --> 12:14.215
-Let's get out there.
-Fantastic.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.192
-It's the only way things
get done, right?
-That's right.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.060
Matty: I love dive day, captain.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.746
Now, where are we going exactly?

12:27.897 --> 12:32.083
We are going through
east orleans here,

12:32.235 --> 12:35.144
Up north to the<i> whydah</i> site.
Marconi beach.

12:35.163 --> 12:37.997
Narrator:
In cape cod, massachusetts,

12:38.091 --> 12:41.259
Rick lagina and matty blake
are being transported

12:41.410 --> 12:42.910
To the<i> whydah</i> search area

12:42.929 --> 12:44.837
By captain jeff spiegel,

12:44.990 --> 12:47.248
Who has been working
with barry and brandon clifford

12:47.267 --> 12:49.917
To salvage valuables
related to the<i> whydah</i>

12:50.011 --> 12:51.919
For more than 30 years.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.497
We're excited to get back to it.

12:54.516 --> 12:56.516
-We always are.
-I love it.

12:56.668 --> 12:57.567
Rick:
We're ready.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.855
Rick:
We've all got
our fingers crossed.

13:03.008 --> 13:04.932
I'm hoping to find
something unique today.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.601
Something that tells a story.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.455
We're gonna find treasure,
that's the hope.

13:13.701 --> 13:15.609
-Tony: See, look at this here.
-(seagulls screeching)

13:15.629 --> 13:17.295
That's kind of interesting, huh?

13:17.446 --> 13:19.038
Narrator:
Meanwhile...

13:19.190 --> 13:21.541
Tony sampson
and brandon clifford

13:21.635 --> 13:25.452
Have begun a side scan
sonar survey of the target area

13:25.472 --> 13:28.973
In the hopes of identifying
signs of the<i> whydah's</i> stern

13:29.125 --> 13:33.478
And the vast cache of valuables
it is believed to contain.

13:33.629 --> 13:35.538
Should we try and give it
a shot east/west

13:35.557 --> 13:36.773
-And just see what we
come up with there?
-Sure.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.562
Narrator:
The humminbird helix 10
sonar device

13:42.714 --> 13:44.897
Emits high-frequency
sound pulses

13:44.991 --> 13:47.717
That reflect off the ocean floor

13:47.810 --> 13:49.828
To produce an image
of the bottom,

13:49.979 --> 13:53.556
As well as any potential
structures, or objects,

13:53.649 --> 13:56.075
That may not be
natural features.

13:56.227 --> 13:59.838
Tony:
So, what we're doing,
we call it lawn mowing.

13:59.989 --> 14:02.065
So, you're literally going
up and back in lines,

14:02.083 --> 14:03.091
Like lawn mowing.

14:04.569 --> 14:06.235
The side scan, what it does,

14:06.254 --> 14:09.013
Is it looks down
and out to the side

14:09.165 --> 14:11.257
And you can actually
see the height of the structure

14:11.351 --> 14:15.578
Off the bottom as well, and
any shadows that it puts out.

14:15.671 --> 14:18.339
So, in a perfect world here
you might see, um,

14:18.433 --> 14:21.084
A timber structure or maybe
something like an anchor

14:21.177 --> 14:22.485
Protruding from the bottom.

14:23.438 --> 14:25.254
Brandon:
Fortunately, this spot

14:25.273 --> 14:27.532
Is uncovered from sand
and we're getting some

14:27.683 --> 14:31.202
Pretty, pretty nice images
with our side scan.

14:31.429 --> 14:35.781
Narrator:
While tony and brandon continue
their side-scan sonar survey...

14:35.876 --> 14:37.876
Matty: Barry!

14:38.103 --> 14:40.694
Good to see you again,
my friend.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.048
Narrator:
...Captain jeff, rick and matty
arrive at the search area

14:44.200 --> 14:46.700
Where they rejoin
barry clifford.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.136
Rick:
All right, barry's on board.

14:50.115 --> 14:51.038
Matty:
My friend.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.557
Barry:
How are you?

14:52.784 --> 14:53.950
Well, it's good to see you
on the water.

14:53.968 --> 14:55.042
I think this is your
natural habitat.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.895
Been here a long time.

14:57.046 --> 14:58.879
-Matty: Yes, sir.
-Almost 40 years.

14:58.973 --> 15:00.732
I see your son is over here.

15:00.883 --> 15:03.234
What's the... What's the
dive plan today with him?

15:03.386 --> 15:05.645
We're essentially
following artifacts

15:05.797 --> 15:07.906
That we found before

15:08.133 --> 15:09.556
And we believe are
leading to the stern.

15:09.651 --> 15:12.301
-Ooh.
-So, all of the valuables

15:12.320 --> 15:15.821
That they stole from the
54 ships that they captured,

15:15.916 --> 15:17.657
Were supposedly in this area.

15:17.809 --> 15:19.659
Wow.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.421
Narrator:
While tony and brandon
gather the data needed

15:23.572 --> 15:27.166
To dive on the wreck of the
<i> whydah</i> from their boat,

15:27.318 --> 15:31.745
Rick, matty and barry clifford
are monitoring the operation

15:31.765 --> 15:34.507
From their own boat
less than 100 yards away.

15:34.659 --> 15:36.159
Look how linear this is.

15:36.177 --> 15:38.995
-Mm-hmm.
-That's kind of weird, huh?

15:39.013 --> 15:41.105
I mean,
that is unbelievably linear.

15:41.332 --> 15:43.683
Brandon:
You know,
maybe a cannon possibly.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.685
Tony:
Yeah. Like, that's what
I think, yeah.

15:45.837 --> 15:47.853
On the side scan,
when we're looking at it,

15:48.006 --> 15:49.263
We're actually seeing

15:49.282 --> 15:51.190
An artifact that looks
like cannon.

15:51.342 --> 15:53.176
Our heartrates are going up

15:53.194 --> 15:54.935
And we're getting excited

15:55.029 --> 15:56.788
Seeing this sort of stuff
on the bottom.

15:56.939 --> 16:00.208
Brandon:
Yeah, this is
a good area to dive.

16:01.944 --> 16:03.211
Brandon:
Boat one to boat two?

16:04.372 --> 16:05.964
Yeah, copy that,
you're loud and clear.

16:06.115 --> 16:08.024
We're gonna set up
and we're gonna head inshore

16:08.117 --> 16:11.118
To this wreckage
that we're looking at

16:11.137 --> 16:13.287
And make a couple dives on it.

16:13.381 --> 16:16.199
We scanned the wreck and it
looks pretty interesting.

16:16.217 --> 16:19.978
There are a few shapes
that look like cannon,

16:20.129 --> 16:21.813
With deep shadows.

16:21.964 --> 16:24.798
Pretty interesting,
so, we're excited to go jump it.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.726
Okay, all right, standing by.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.803
Boat two out.

16:29.897 --> 16:31.230
When you hear things like that,

16:31.382 --> 16:31.990
You want to jump
in the water, yourself.

16:32.141 --> 16:33.825
(laughter)

16:33.976 --> 16:35.994
Barry:
This could be a section
of the ship.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.221
And what's happening with
this weather we've been getting,

16:38.239 --> 16:40.072
Are things that
have been getting uncovered.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.166
But who knows?

16:42.318 --> 16:44.651
-That could be
a piece of the<i> whydah.</i>
-Incredible.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.395
All right, well, we have
a comms system, we can stay

16:46.414 --> 16:47.839
In touch with the divers
as they dive here.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.990
So, I'll get the transducer
in the water

16:50.010 --> 16:50.991
And we can monitor
their progress.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.760
Okay.

16:55.406 --> 16:56.848
Matty:
Tony and brandon are just about

16:57.075 --> 16:59.183
To get into the water there
on their dive boat.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.410
Barry, rick and myself
will stay topside.

17:01.504 --> 17:04.580
Monitoring comms, stay in
communication with them.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.191
I want success
for barry and brandon,

17:07.343 --> 17:09.843
Not just for them, but also
to kind of represent

17:09.863 --> 17:11.845
What we are here in new England.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.698
You know, we're hard workers,

17:13.849 --> 17:16.275
We love our history,
and we don't stop.

17:16.427 --> 17:18.202
Hopefully, today's the day.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.190
Rick:
Splash one.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.043
Jeff:
Divers in the water.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.621
Matty:
Second diver in.

17:28.773 --> 17:31.274
Tony sampson's in the water.

17:31.292 --> 17:32.884
All right, we have
divers in the water.

17:33.111 --> 17:34.218
Yep.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.317
Comms are here,
we hear you. Over.

17:50.812 --> 17:54.797
Tony:
We splash and the currents
aren't bad at all.

17:54.890 --> 17:58.651
We start to descend down,
the heart drops a little

17:58.803 --> 18:00.970
Because we realize
the visibility

18:00.988 --> 18:04.323
Is around at two feet
to three feet maximum.

18:04.475 --> 18:06.375
You know, this is all
part of the game.

18:14.001 --> 18:16.427
Brandon:
Diving on the<i> whydah</i>
is very technical.

18:16.579 --> 18:17.929
You know, we depend heavily
on safety, you know,

18:18.080 --> 18:19.746
And-and-technique.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.749
We deal with an ever-changing
climate down there.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.268
And when you're working
with other divers,

18:24.420 --> 18:26.253
You're really depending
on each other to be there

18:26.347 --> 18:28.106
And to be able
to support each other.

18:39.677 --> 18:41.510
Ooh.

18:41.529 --> 18:45.206
Repeat. Did you say on target?
Confirm. Over.

19:01.215 --> 19:03.215
Matty:
We like to hear that, brandon.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.310
Do you have your metal detector
with you, tony? Over.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.981
(beeping)

19:14.470 --> 19:15.895
(detector beeping)

19:15.989 --> 19:17.380
Matty:
Love it.

19:17.398 --> 19:18.656
Sing, baby, sing.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.255
Love it. Sing, baby, sing. Over.

19:37.735 --> 19:41.737
Narrator:
Just off the coast
of cape cod, massachusetts,

19:41.756 --> 19:44.831
Divers tony sampson
and brandon clifford

19:44.851 --> 19:46.350
Have just found
possible evidence

19:46.577 --> 19:50.504
Of a portion of the legendary
<i> wydah gally,</i>

19:50.523 --> 19:54.025
Captained by the notorious
pirate black sam bellamy.

19:54.176 --> 19:56.435
The<i> whydah</i> broke apart

19:56.529 --> 20:00.439
And sank in a violent nor'easter
back in 1717,

20:00.591 --> 20:03.284
Along with a massive fortune
in treasure.

20:10.359 --> 20:11.709
Matty:
Sounds good. Any way to tell

20:11.860 --> 20:13.936
What size timers they are,

20:14.029 --> 20:15.838
How big are the timbers? Over.

20:28.043 --> 20:30.019
Copy that.

20:48.155 --> 20:50.581
Wow. Nailed it.

20:50.733 --> 20:53.309
Barry:
It's very interesting that
it's a very intact section

20:53.327 --> 20:55.327
Of a wooden ship.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.146
It needs to be investigated.

20:57.164 --> 20:59.090
You know, it's a big section
of the ship.

20:59.317 --> 21:00.758
It definitely could be
part of the<i> whydah.</i>

21:00.985 --> 21:03.427
Now you know definitively
it's not just not a...

21:03.579 --> 21:05.096
Not just an image
on a side scan.

21:05.247 --> 21:07.172
-Barry: Oh, no.
-It's eyes on the target.

21:07.325 --> 21:08.915
Yeah. It's history
no matter what it is.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.417
Absolutely is.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.104
How's the visibility
down there, fellas? Over.

21:19.170 --> 21:22.004
Tony:
Every time we fan the sand,
we're silted out.

21:22.023 --> 21:23.856
And then all of a sudden,

21:24.008 --> 21:27.267
It's like somebody has tipped
a salad bowl on top of us

21:27.361 --> 21:28.935
And you have this mung weed,

21:28.955 --> 21:31.605
It's like lettuce floating
past your mask.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.541
And you are literally
swimming in a salad.

21:45.196 --> 21:47.471
Roger that. We hear you.
Surface is waiting.

21:47.623 --> 21:50.032
Come on up
when you're ready. Over.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.383
Brandon:
You really can't see anything.

21:51.477 --> 21:52.959
So, we really have to back off

21:52.979 --> 21:55.387
And wait until we can work
in clearer water

21:55.540 --> 21:57.039
So we can get all...

21:57.132 --> 21:58.374
Collect all the data
that we could use.

21:58.467 --> 21:59.708
They're coming up.
Right over there.

21:59.802 --> 22:01.727
-Barry: Oh, yep.
-Matty: Got them all.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.729
All the divers are up.

22:03.881 --> 22:06.382
Tony:
I believe what we were seeing
on the side scan

22:06.475 --> 22:08.400
Was these large wooden
structures.

22:08.553 --> 22:10.052
You know, now it looks like

22:10.145 --> 22:11.904
We're following
the yellow brick road.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.889
You sounded happy down there,
like you had a great target.

22:13.908 --> 22:15.741
Tell me about it.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.819
Well, we saw, uh, a lot of big
pieces of old timbers.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.396
The first piece,

22:20.489 --> 22:23.399
We swam upon was
what we think was a spar,

22:23.492 --> 22:24.900
A part of the rigging
on the ship.

22:24.993 --> 22:27.903
A round, beautiful piece
of long wood.

22:27.922 --> 22:30.497
It's definitely within
the vicinity of the<i> whydah.</i>

22:30.591 --> 22:32.165
And that wood
could've been buried for,

22:32.259 --> 22:33.333
You know, hundreds of years

22:33.427 --> 22:35.928
And preserved under sand, so...

22:36.080 --> 22:37.096
Matty:
We're running out
of daylight here,

22:37.190 --> 22:38.839
So let's do it again tomorrow.

22:38.933 --> 22:40.340
Brandon:
Tomorrow, I think we should

22:40.434 --> 22:42.509
Actually move off of this spot.

22:42.603 --> 22:44.269
-Matty: Okay.
-Just because the visibility
is not very good.

22:44.422 --> 22:46.605
And we-we'll head offshore
a little ways

22:46.699 --> 22:49.108
-Where we hope to find
better visibility
-matty: Right.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.702
And pick up on that debris field
that we've been working on.

22:51.929 --> 22:53.779
In the meantime, you guys
should come check out

22:53.873 --> 22:55.948
The whydah pirate museum.
I think you'll really enjoy it.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.449
Matty:
Let's do it.

22:57.602 --> 22:59.043
Okay, everybody, thanks.
Great dive.

23:00.028 --> 23:01.003
Good work.

23:02.106 --> 23:04.106
Narrator:
Later that afternoon...

23:04.199 --> 23:06.032
-So, this is it, huh?
-This is it.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.200
It's awesome.

23:07.294 --> 23:09.111
-Come on in.
-All right.

23:09.130 --> 23:11.037
Narrator:
...Barry and brandon clifford

23:11.132 --> 23:13.707
Welcome matty, rick and tony

23:13.801 --> 23:15.284
To the whydah pirate museum

23:15.302 --> 23:18.044
Located in west yarmouth,
massachusetts.

23:18.139 --> 23:19.805
Matty:
This is cool already.

23:19.957 --> 23:21.957
Wow.

23:22.050 --> 23:24.050
Brandon:
Here you see
the-the<i> whydah's</i> anchor.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.070
Oh, wow.

23:26.297 --> 23:27.146
One of the anchors.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.556
Matty:
My goodness.

23:29.650 --> 23:31.650
Your-your team found this?

23:31.744 --> 23:34.653
Brandon:
We did. We've recovered
three anchors so far.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.305
I mean, it's so pristine,
it's like in perfect shape.

23:36.323 --> 23:37.990
And it speaks to the size
of the ship, too.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.733
That's incredible.

23:39.827 --> 23:41.810
It tells me a couple things.

23:41.904 --> 23:43.495
Number one is the size
of the ship is massive.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.165
The other thing that it tells me
is how violent the storm was.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.150
That is a huge anchor

23:48.169 --> 23:51.262
And this ship got tossed
like a rag doll,

23:51.413 --> 23:53.580
Turned upside-down,
churned and sunk.

23:53.674 --> 23:56.825
We're gonna take you in and show
you some of our concretions now

23:56.919 --> 23:58.327
That our archeologists
are working on.

23:58.345 --> 24:00.253
Let's go.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.182
Narrator:
Established in 2016,

24:03.276 --> 24:07.186
This facility is one of two
museums related to the<i> whydah</i>

24:07.338 --> 24:10.614
That have been founded
by barry clifford.

24:10.766 --> 24:13.692
It houses thousands of artifacts
recovered from the wreck,

24:13.786 --> 24:18.438
Including one concretion that
contains the entire skeleton

24:18.532 --> 24:19.606
Of an unidentified crew member.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.533
Matty:
Oh, man.

24:21.686 --> 24:23.461
Barry:
It's the tomb
of the lost pirate.

24:25.022 --> 24:25.921
No kidding.

24:27.191 --> 24:29.525
Barry:
This is a human skeleton
encapsulated

24:29.543 --> 24:30.709
Within that concretion.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.219
Matty:
Oh, my god.

24:33.380 --> 24:36.098
X-ray machine.
Let me show you. Um...

24:38.219 --> 24:40.385
This is his pelvis.

24:40.538 --> 24:42.387
-Matty: Oh, my god.
-Rick: There he is.

24:42.540 --> 24:43.797
Barry:
And right over his pocket,

24:43.891 --> 24:45.316
Where his pocket would be,

24:45.543 --> 24:47.392
It appears to be a pocket
filled with treasure.

24:47.545 --> 24:49.803
Matty:
Oh, those look like coins.
Yeah, you're right. Wow.

24:49.897 --> 24:52.231
Barry:
And you can see one
of his bones sticking up out...

24:52.325 --> 24:54.566
Matty:
Oh, my god.

24:54.719 --> 24:57.143
Barry:
We brought this up
many, many, many years ago.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.312
And we've kept it together
like this because it...

24:59.332 --> 25:02.074
I think it captures
what things look like

25:02.168 --> 25:04.243
After they've been under
the water for so long.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.246
Brandon:
These concretions we've
recovered, they're essentially

25:07.340 --> 25:08.655
Time capsules, right?

25:08.749 --> 25:10.508
We-we don't know
what's inside them.

25:10.735 --> 25:12.901
And-and the only way you can
find out what's inside them,

25:12.995 --> 25:14.903
The first step is to x-ray it.

25:14.922 --> 25:17.756
After having a good x-ray
of the concretion,

25:17.908 --> 25:20.184
Our conservators are able to

25:20.335 --> 25:22.836
Then approach the artifacts
within the concretion

25:22.855 --> 25:24.838
Using, like, the proper methods.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.749
Barry:
I want to introduce you
to our archeologist,

25:26.842 --> 25:29.509
Andrew, who's in charge
of, uh, de-concreting.

25:29.529 --> 25:30.677
Hey, andrew. Tony.
Nice to meet you.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.421
-Hey, tony.
-Hey, matty blake.

25:32.514 --> 25:33.847
-How are you? Good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.774
All right, if you want
to step this way...

25:35.868 --> 25:37.926
-Oh, yeah.
-...Got a little
surprise for you guys here.

25:37.945 --> 25:39.428
You're gonna like this.

25:39.521 --> 25:41.263
This is a very special
concretion.

25:41.356 --> 25:42.706
We don't find these every day.

25:44.026 --> 25:45.601
-Tony: Oh, look at the coins.
-Rick: Oh, look what I see.

25:45.619 --> 25:47.878
-Matty: Oh! Wow.
-Andrew: You see all the coins?

25:48.105 --> 25:48.862
Andrew:
So, the coins here,
here, here.

25:48.956 --> 25:50.606
And if you look, they go all

25:50.624 --> 25:52.866
The way through the center
to under here.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.443
So, this is a stack of coins

25:54.461 --> 25:55.944
That goes through
the entire concretion

25:55.963 --> 25:57.555
And then boom, right there
in the middle,

25:57.782 --> 26:00.299
You can see that piece
of a gold bar.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.876
-Matty: What?
That's gold all right.
-Andrew: Yeah.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.970
-Matty: Wow. That's gold, baby.
-Andrew: Yeah.

26:05.122 --> 26:06.955
Tony:
That is fantastic.

26:06.974 --> 26:10.734
Barry:
Once we discovered what
we had and the thousands

26:10.961 --> 26:13.312
And thousands of artifacts
that we've brought up,

26:13.406 --> 26:16.648
It became an obligation
to me to preserve everything.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.803
And we've never sold one
bit of artifacts or treasure.

26:20.821 --> 26:22.471
We've kept it all intact.

26:22.564 --> 26:25.324
You know, we have
a big, big job ahead of us.

26:25.476 --> 26:28.252
These stories have to be
told with integrity.

26:28.403 --> 26:30.588
When's the last time you saw
a bag of pirate treasure?

26:30.739 --> 26:32.923
-Nobody's seen it.
-They don't.

26:33.075 --> 26:36.743
-This is the world's only
documented pirate treasure.
-Matty: Wow.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.596
Tomorrow, when we go diving,
we're going to go back

26:38.747 --> 26:41.490
To the same spot where
we recovered this concretion

26:41.583 --> 26:43.100
And we hope to find
more of the same.

26:43.251 --> 26:45.436
-Oh, man.
-Fantastic.

26:45.587 --> 26:46.770
Look at that grin.

26:46.922 --> 26:48.772
(laughter)

26:48.999 --> 26:50.999
-That's exciting.
-Tony: No, that's awesome.

26:51.018 --> 26:53.694
Brandon:
Fingers crossed
for a great dive.

27:02.847 --> 27:04.696
Matty:
Artifacts, treasure.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.707
Today's the day.

27:09.203 --> 27:11.854
Narrator:
As a new day begins
off the coast

27:11.872 --> 27:13.780
Of cape cod, massachusetts,

27:13.874 --> 27:17.209
On board his research vessel,
the<i> vast explorer...</i>

27:17.361 --> 27:19.470
Barry:
Okay, we're there.

27:19.621 --> 27:22.139
Narrator: ...Barry clifford
continues to scan

27:22.290 --> 27:25.458
The ocean floor for artifacts
related to the<i> whydah,</i>

27:25.478 --> 27:29.538
A pirate ship that sank in 1717,

27:29.556 --> 27:32.708
Along with its cargo
of treasure worth hundreds

27:32.726 --> 27:34.543
Of millions of dollars.

27:35.637 --> 27:37.396
Tony:
It seems to be a hot spot
there, doesn't it?

27:37.490 --> 27:39.898
I think we're on the spot.
Let's give it a go, mate.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.307
All right, tony, let's do it.
Suit it up.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.809
Don't know unless we look, eh?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.569
(laughs) yeah. Don't know
until you go.

27:44.722 --> 27:47.222
Narrator: Approximately 200 feet
to the south,

27:47.241 --> 27:50.893
Brandon clifford and
tony samson have stationed

27:50.986 --> 27:53.153
Themselves on a separate
dive boat

27:53.247 --> 27:55.655
Where they are using
side-scan sonar

27:55.675 --> 27:58.342
To help identify
a promising target

27:58.493 --> 28:01.904
That they hope is part
of the<i> whydah's</i> stern section,

28:01.922 --> 28:04.181
Which would have been
carrying a significant portion

28:04.332 --> 28:05.683
Of the ship's valuables.

28:08.095 --> 28:12.080
As brandon and tony
confirmed their target area

28:12.099 --> 28:14.024
In preparation for a dive,

28:14.176 --> 28:17.753
Matty blake and rick lagina
monitor their progress

28:17.771 --> 28:20.364
From a third boat nearby.

28:20.515 --> 28:22.783
Tony samson or anyone
on the dive boat. Copy?

28:25.204 --> 28:27.020
Hey, tony,
just checking your status.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.539
I-I can kind of see
from a distance.

28:28.766 --> 28:31.691
Do you think you have
a good spot? Over.

28:31.785 --> 28:33.335
Copy that, matty. Um...

28:38.718 --> 28:40.384
Matty: All right,
we will come up to you,

28:40.535 --> 28:41.719
And we'll start this dive.

28:42.963 --> 28:44.722
Let's have a good dive,
gentlemen. Over and out.

28:48.135 --> 28:51.636
Tony:
To be able to come back here
and dive the<i> whydah,</i>

28:51.731 --> 28:54.064
You know, this is
just a dream come true.

28:54.216 --> 28:55.715
It's unbelievable.

28:55.735 --> 28:59.811
-Okay, one for one, one for all.
-Yeah.

28:59.964 --> 29:02.222
Tony:
I'm hoping we get in there,
it's nice and flat and sure,

29:02.316 --> 29:04.224
We have good visibility

29:04.318 --> 29:07.469
And we actually get the chance
to go down and find something.

29:07.562 --> 29:10.664
All right,
you're looking good, brando.

29:14.161 --> 29:16.336
Diver one in the water.

29:17.998 --> 29:20.507
-Yay. Splash one.
-Boom.

29:22.336 --> 29:25.153
Brandon:
Right now I'm gonna dive first.

29:25.172 --> 29:27.431
It's efficient for us
to send one diver in,

29:27.582 --> 29:29.324
Assess the conditions.

29:29.343 --> 29:32.010
Tony's going to stay on deck,
and the reason is,

29:32.162 --> 29:33.345
Is it's just more efficient.

29:33.497 --> 29:34.846
If you send two or three divers

29:34.940 --> 29:36.774
In the water and
the visibility is no good,

29:36.925 --> 29:38.350
Then you have to get two or
three divers out of the water.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.610
And you also used air.

29:45.342 --> 29:47.951
I hear you, buddy. Over.

30:02.709 --> 30:04.468
Roger that.

30:05.954 --> 30:08.196
Matty:
This is matty over
to the dive boat.

30:08.215 --> 30:09.973
Tony, we're going
to hold you for now.

30:10.125 --> 30:13.051
We're going to hold you
for now on the surface.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.555
Brandon says<i> no bueno</i>
on visibility. Over.

30:17.799 --> 30:20.042
Tony:
I'm sitting there on the boat.
I'm still in my gear.

30:20.060 --> 30:21.710
I'm just itching, you know,
I want to get down,

30:21.728 --> 30:23.970
I want to get down,
I want to get down.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.472
But sometimes
you have to sit this out.

30:26.567 --> 30:29.051
It's just the way it is.
From a safety point of view,

30:29.069 --> 30:32.237
If we send more divers
down with zero visibility,

30:32.389 --> 30:34.906
Chances are we may
actually ensnare ourselves

30:35.059 --> 30:36.983
In the reel line
that brandon's running.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.336
So, this is a much safer plan.

30:47.754 --> 30:50.238
Roger that.
We hear you loud and clear.

30:50.257 --> 30:52.516
Do what you can do. Be safe.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.184
We'll talk soon. Over.

30:56.671 --> 31:00.340
Brandon:
I'm doing a radial search.
I'm using a search line.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.583
I'm going to clip into the
anchor,

31:01.676 --> 31:03.843
Which marks our gps point,

31:03.863 --> 31:05.863
And then I'm going to do
a ten-foot circle,

31:06.014 --> 31:08.031
And then I'm going to go out
15 feet on my search line

31:08.183 --> 31:09.774
And then 20.

31:09.927 --> 31:12.202
And as I do that,
I'm using a metal detector

31:12.354 --> 31:15.497
To search for any objects
that may be scattered about.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.544
Do you have a detector
on you, a metal detector? Over.

31:31.615 --> 31:32.681
Matty:
Copy that.

31:35.877 --> 31:38.562
(metal detector beeping)

31:40.474 --> 31:42.566
(beeping)

31:45.887 --> 31:47.154
(beeping intensifies)

31:59.977 --> 32:01.159
That's great. He's getting hits.

32:01.311 --> 32:02.235
He's worked his way up

32:02.329 --> 32:04.479
Right off our bow here.

32:04.498 --> 32:06.506
(beeping)

32:21.923 --> 32:23.941
Just checking in.
How you doing, buddy? Over.

32:30.841 --> 32:33.525
-Ooh.
-Ah, we got an artifact.

32:33.677 --> 32:34.743
We got some in the bag, baby.

32:35.846 --> 32:37.529
-All right.
-There you go.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.772
I mean, when he started
this dive, I was thinking,

32:39.792 --> 32:41.774
This is going to get
called early.

32:41.868 --> 32:43.961
-And he probably doesn't
know what it is either.
-Right, right.

32:44.112 --> 32:46.354
But just the fact he's got
something, that's exciting.

32:46.448 --> 32:47.872
Yeah, very exciting stuff.

32:48.025 --> 32:50.116
Ah. Brandon's got something.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.377
This is what
I've been waiting for.

32:52.529 --> 32:54.196
He's got an artifact,
and I just can't wait

32:54.214 --> 32:55.764
To get him to the surface
to see what it is.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.940
Oh. Diver leaving the bottom.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.154
Jon:
Diver one on surface.

33:12.307 --> 33:13.740
He's got something.

33:15.643 --> 33:16.994
-Jon: How'd you make out?
-Brandon: Good.

33:19.223 --> 33:20.247
Oh.

33:22.409 --> 33:23.625
It's not pretty down there.

33:25.487 --> 33:28.321
-No?
-No. We're in the black sand.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.506
-Tony: Is that right?
-Brandon: Yeah.

33:32.586 --> 33:35.178
-No fricking way.
-Jon: Ah!

33:35.330 --> 33:37.180
I see some smiles.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.850
Tony:
Matty's gonna lose his mind.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.025
Tony: No fricking way.
Jon: Ah!

33:48.252 --> 33:51.010
-Look at that beauty.
-Tony: No way, buddy.

33:51.030 --> 33:54.773
I see some smiles. What is that?

33:54.867 --> 33:57.592
-That looks like a coin to me.
-Spanish eight real, buddy.

33:57.685 --> 34:00.428
-Come on.
-Is it really?

34:00.522 --> 34:01.687
Are you kidding me? Come on.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.023
It's beautiful.

34:04.117 --> 34:08.194
Narrator:
Off the coast of cape cod,
massachusetts,

34:08.288 --> 34:12.198
Diver brandon clifford has
just made a valuable discovery

34:12.292 --> 34:15.460
While searching for artifacts
from the<i> whydah gally,</i>

34:15.612 --> 34:19.890
A famous pirate shipwreck
that sank in 1717

34:20.117 --> 34:21.966
With hundreds of millions
of dollars' worth

34:22.119 --> 34:24.286
Of treasure onboard.

34:24.379 --> 34:28.714
Tony:
This is a spanish coin
from the wreck of the<i> whydah.</i>

34:28.809 --> 34:30.475
It is unbelievable.

34:30.627 --> 34:32.811
Holding that coin
is my childhood again.

34:32.905 --> 34:35.463
You know, it's like
the heart rate picks up

34:35.482 --> 34:37.632
And it's like I'm reliving
my little boy's dream

34:37.725 --> 34:39.392
Of finding pirate treasure.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.227
It's in perfect shape.
Look at that.

34:41.321 --> 34:42.487
Tony:
Isn't it gorgeous?

34:42.639 --> 34:44.656
-Matty: It's still ridged.
-Wow.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.065
Matty:
Oh, my gosh.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.918
Rick:
This is a beautiful,

34:48.145 --> 34:50.979
Just incredibly preserved
silver real.

34:50.997 --> 34:52.905
It's a top pocket find.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.740
I mean, there's no question
about it.

34:54.760 --> 34:58.486
That little coin
speaks to history,

34:58.580 --> 35:01.098
And that was
an incredible moment.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.824
Brandon:
We also have a spoon.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.343
Matty:
Look at that. Spoon.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.420
Rick:
What was the last meal
that touched?

35:07.514 --> 35:09.514
-Who was the last person
to touch it?
-Matty: You see that?

35:09.608 --> 35:12.334
This is spectacular, buddy.
Well done, mate.

35:12.352 --> 35:13.852
Matty:
Could this come
from the<i> whydah?</i>

35:13.946 --> 35:15.353
-Brandon: Oh, yeah.
-Matty: That's awesome.

35:15.505 --> 35:16.780
I would imagine you are gonna

35:17.007 --> 35:19.098
Continue on this spot
in particular,

35:19.192 --> 35:22.010
If you found both these items
in bad vis that quickly.

35:22.028 --> 35:23.936
-Brandon: This is a good area.
-Yeah.

35:23.956 --> 35:26.531
So, we'll just continue
to-to work in this vicinity.

35:26.683 --> 35:29.942
Well, congratulations
to the whole team.

35:29.962 --> 35:33.355
-And, uh, man, we got to
show this to your dad.
-Yeah.

35:33.448 --> 35:35.966
-We got to show this
to your dad. Whoo.
-Brandon: He'll be happy.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.635
Matty:
I mean, this is
an incredible find.

35:38.862 --> 35:41.621
That eight real plopped
in my hand. It's heavy.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.866
There's some pirate
that had that coin in his bag

35:44.959 --> 35:47.719
And was using that
in the 18th century.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.054
Barry, you got to come on
and see what we found.

35:50.207 --> 35:52.983
And this kid from here
is holding it next.

35:53.210 --> 35:55.152
I can just say it fills me
with awe.

35:55.379 --> 35:56.153
Ready?

35:57.547 --> 36:00.382
Brandon:
Finding this coin
is another clue,

36:00.400 --> 36:03.551
Uh, to where the wreckage
of the<i> whydah</i> may lie.

36:03.570 --> 36:04.828
Jeff:
All right. Ready?

36:06.056 --> 36:08.981
And they represent something
like very powerful,

36:09.001 --> 36:10.816
You know, a transaction
of human life.

36:10.911 --> 36:13.170
Barry:
Oh, my god. Look at that.

36:14.414 --> 36:15.580
Rick: Isn't that stunning?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.657
Barry:
Eight real.

36:17.676 --> 36:21.586
It's in perfect condition.
It's absolutely perfect.

36:21.738 --> 36:23.513
Wow. This is great, you guys.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.331
Tony:
Fantastic. It's beautiful stuff.

36:25.425 --> 36:26.741
-It really is.
-Matty: So great.

36:26.760 --> 36:28.501
I'm so happy for you guys.

36:28.595 --> 36:31.188
I mean, this father and son team
comes out in this vastness

36:31.415 --> 36:34.432
And can pull things that small
out of the ocean,

36:34.526 --> 36:36.193
But that valuable,
that small, that valuable.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.770
That meaningful.
That tells a story.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.939
I mean, I'm just really happy
for you guys.

36:41.091 --> 36:43.849
These things don't happen
overnight, right?

36:43.869 --> 36:46.110
It's been a long road for you.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.689
I am most impressed that
the body of work you've done,

36:49.783 --> 36:52.709
The experiences you've created,
the memories you've created,

36:52.936 --> 36:54.452
Father to son,
passing on the legacy.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.605
I-I think it's all...

36:57.699 --> 36:59.532
This day couldn't
be more picture-perfect.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.610
And I, again, I thank you both
for the opportunity

37:02.704 --> 37:05.964
To-to share
a very unique experience.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.374
-And all I can say is thank you.
-Barry: Thank you.

37:08.468 --> 37:11.286
You know, we've been out here
40 years on this project.

37:11.304 --> 37:14.380
It-it's been a wild, wild ride
for me,

37:14.474 --> 37:16.716
But I'm still in the saddle,

37:16.810 --> 37:20.052
And, you know, hopefully,
we can continue to do this.

37:20.146 --> 37:22.297
Brandon:
We feel fortunate to get
to do this work out here.

37:22.390 --> 37:24.466
It's a beautiful place to be

37:24.484 --> 37:27.318
And great people
to work with, and, uh,

37:27.471 --> 37:29.395
We always have to
think of our team

37:29.414 --> 37:32.565
Because, you know, we're really
nothing without them.

37:32.584 --> 37:36.494
I think it's really important
to continue this work.

37:36.646 --> 37:39.089
You know, my-my father
blazed the trail,

37:39.240 --> 37:41.925
And-and we have, you know,
a heavy load to carry.

37:42.076 --> 37:45.911
I feel that we are stewards
of the shipwreck, you know,

37:45.931 --> 37:50.249
And that we need to do our best
to protect it and, uh,

37:50.343 --> 37:53.678
Look at the key points
of history that it represents

37:53.830 --> 37:56.514
And help share that experience
with others.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.442
It was a fantastic day,
and thank you, guys,

37:59.669 --> 38:01.185
For coming up here.
Or down here.

38:01.338 --> 38:02.520
Tony:
Thanks so much, brandon.

38:02.672 --> 38:03.947
Matty:
Unbelievable finds.

38:13.867 --> 38:16.275
Matty: Well, what a trip.

38:16.295 --> 38:19.020
It was great to watch this guy
get to be part of it

38:19.113 --> 38:20.538
And this guy to see my hometown,

38:20.690 --> 38:22.132
Like you guys have
brought me to michigan.

38:22.359 --> 38:25.527
But you left me, you know,
standing at the altar.

38:25.545 --> 38:27.137
-(matty laughs)
-thanks a lot, guys.

38:27.364 --> 38:28.954
I know how I feel.
I wish you were all there.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.122
Marty:
Going on an actual
treasure ship, right?

38:30.142 --> 38:31.549
-Yeah.
-Okay.

38:31.701 --> 38:33.459
-Matty: Incredible.
-Marty: All right, okay.

38:33.553 --> 38:35.203
But these guys got in the water

38:35.296 --> 38:37.872
And found some
of that pirate treasure.

38:37.891 --> 38:40.224
-Marty: Very cool.
-Matty: And that is just
so exciting.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.818
What have I got here?
What am I looking at?

38:43.563 --> 38:46.564
Tony:
What you're looking at there
is a spoon from the wreck

38:46.658 --> 38:49.217
And also a coin from
the wreck site as well.

38:49.235 --> 38:50.735
That came up looking
just like that.

38:50.887 --> 38:53.555
-Matty: It's so beautiful.
-Marty: Really?

38:53.648 --> 38:55.573
-Matty: Yeah.
-Marty: Why is that?
'cause it's likely silver.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.001
Well, you see, when metals
are touching metals,

38:58.152 --> 38:59.410
Obviously,
that's when they degrade.

38:59.563 --> 39:00.411
So, the same as the...

39:00.505 --> 39:01.821
So this was by itself?

39:01.915 --> 39:03.414
-Exactly.
-I see.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.508
So, if it's in a
conglomeration or concretion

39:05.660 --> 39:07.418
Touching, as you said,

39:07.512 --> 39:09.921
-You know, like an anode,
it will sacrifice itself.
-Mm-hmm.

39:10.073 --> 39:11.756
But if it's in
that anaerobic environment,

39:11.908 --> 39:14.184
Be it silt or sand,

39:14.411 --> 39:16.244
Then it comes out
looking like that.

39:16.262 --> 39:18.671
Barry and brandon are standing
by with an update on that coin

39:18.765 --> 39:21.766
And-and some more information,
so I'd love to bring them up.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.777
-Sure.
-Please do. Yeah,
I'd like to meet them.

39:25.271 --> 39:26.754
Matty:
Hello, fellas.

39:26.848 --> 39:28.089
-Good morning.
-Morning.

39:28.108 --> 39:29.107
Marty:
Good morning.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.533
Welcome to the war room.

39:31.853 --> 39:33.686
Thank you.

39:33.780 --> 39:36.689
So, the incredible coin
that you brought up, brandon,

39:36.708 --> 39:39.191
Have you identified it for sure?

39:39.211 --> 39:41.026
Have you done any
further analysis of it?

39:41.121 --> 39:45.364
So, we've done some analysis
of the silver coin we found,

39:45.384 --> 39:47.867
And we have some pretty
interesting news about it.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.387
Ooh. All right.

39:50.538 --> 39:52.555
-Marty: Can't wait to hear.
-Matty: Can't wait.

39:57.378 --> 40:01.213
Brandon: So, the coin that we've
recovered is super interesting.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.900
Our archaeologist andrew
has been examining it.

40:05.478 --> 40:07.386
Andrew put it through
electrolysis.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.130
It was from 1710.

40:10.133 --> 40:15.060
A spanish silver
eight real minted in lima.

40:16.063 --> 40:17.989
Is that the legendary
piece of eight?

40:18.141 --> 40:18.898
Is that what that is?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.417
It is.

40:20.568 --> 40:22.234
It's a spanish piece of eight.
Exactly.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.811
Correct me if I'm wrong,

40:23.830 --> 40:25.647
But that's pirate treasure,
correct?

40:25.740 --> 40:26.923
-Correct.
-(laughter)

40:28.001 --> 40:29.651
Matty:
I mean, a great find.

40:29.744 --> 40:31.911
Super exciting,
showing that you guys

40:31.930 --> 40:34.097
Were looking in the right area.

40:34.248 --> 40:36.933
Um, and also the spoon,
that incredible artifact.

40:37.084 --> 40:38.918
Uh, have we learned anything
about that since?

40:39.012 --> 40:40.828
Brandon:
Nothing new.

40:40.847 --> 40:43.106
Uh, you know, it was a personal
possession of a pirate.

40:43.257 --> 40:46.167
They probably, you know,
held onto something like that

40:46.186 --> 40:48.169
Closely and it was, you know,
very useful on a ship.

40:48.188 --> 40:50.930
So, we'd like to think
maybe the last person

40:50.949 --> 40:52.690
That ate from that spoon
was a pirate.

40:52.784 --> 40:53.858
Probably.

40:54.010 --> 40:55.510
-Incredible.
-Rick: Wow.

40:55.528 --> 40:58.179
Yeah, it's a story waiting
to be told.

40:58.272 --> 41:01.774
-You know, former slaves
experimenting in democracy...
-Yeah.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.275
...On board a former slave ship.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.462
Marty:
Well, it's a great story,
and it shows

41:05.613 --> 41:08.189
Same common denominators
with other things.

41:08.208 --> 41:10.300
Perseverance.
These things take time.

41:10.451 --> 41:12.043
They're certainly
not easy, are they?

41:12.195 --> 41:14.529
It's impressive.
From-from soup to nuts,

41:14.547 --> 41:17.381
What you guys have done
is just incredible.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.034
I mean, I told you that
while we were there,

41:20.053 --> 41:22.870
And it was an honor
to watch you guys work.

41:22.889 --> 41:25.206
It was a lifetimes
experience really,

41:25.299 --> 41:27.132
-Matty: It was.
-To participate in this,
and we thank you both for that.

41:27.227 --> 41:28.300
It was incredible.

41:28.394 --> 41:29.711
You know, you guys are awesome.

41:29.804 --> 41:31.488
I'd love to get
back down there sometime.

41:31.639 --> 41:32.822
That sounds great.

41:33.049 --> 41:35.049
I'll stay in touch
with you guys.

41:35.068 --> 41:37.568
-You know, I'll do another trip
to boston anytime.
-(laughter)

41:37.721 --> 41:40.163
-Till next time. Thank you.
-Thank you.

41:40.314 --> 41:42.073
Thank you so much.
You guys are great.

41:42.225 --> 41:43.416
-Talk soon.
-Take care.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.822
I say it all the time, right?
Forget the treasure.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.233
This-this story was spectacular.

41:52.252 --> 41:53.918
-Yeah.
-Marty: Well, a lot
of people say,

41:54.012 --> 41:57.255
You know, it-it's more
than treasure and all that,

41:57.407 --> 41:58.998
But they've proved it.

41:59.017 --> 41:59.757
-Matty: Oh, my goodness, yes.
-They've proved it.

41:59.909 --> 42:01.759
But I will say this.

42:01.853 --> 42:06.097
We may have a story like that
here on this island,

42:06.249 --> 42:08.483
And there's only one way
to figure that out.

42:09.753 --> 42:11.102
We've got to get out back
and do something.

42:11.254 --> 42:12.862
All right, let's go.

42:13.014 --> 42:14.756
Matty: Let's go find it.
What do you think?

42:14.774 --> 42:16.032
-Marty: Okay, fine.
-Matty: All right.

42:16.259 --> 42:18.201
