00:12.947 --> 00:15.748
<i>Seeing that</i>
<i>this is the first scene,</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:19.118
<i>can they understand</i>
<i>what they're about to see?</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.619
<i>Focused?</i>

00:24.959 --> 00:27.993
This is not a confession.

00:27.995 --> 00:32.131
This isn't--he said she's dead.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.899
This is the truth.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.970
We're not murderers.

00:42.842 --> 00:45.878
We're not monsters.

00:55.121 --> 00:56.655
Your turn, Chunk.

00:56.657 --> 00:57.856
What?

00:57.858 --> 00:59.425
Okay, Jordan.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.492
When I said
I wanted to make a movie,

01:00.494 --> 01:02.127
this is not what I meant.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.763
Uh, you said video
and correct me if I'm wrong

01:04.765 --> 01:06.899
but who doesn't like...

01:10.637 --> 01:14.540
funny faces,
right, Chunk?

01:14.542 --> 01:16.041
Huh?

01:16.043 --> 01:19.378
How are funny face videos
going to get us...

01:19.380 --> 01:21.280
Continue.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.315
Girls.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.817
This is our last year
of high school

01:24.819 --> 01:25.984
and I don't want to be
remembered

01:25.986 --> 01:28.387
as some girlfriendless
loser.

01:28.389 --> 01:31.523
Chunk's a girl and she likes
funny face videos.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.691
Right, Chunk?

01:34.561 --> 01:35.828
See?

01:35.830 --> 01:38.297
I mean real girls.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.666
No offense, Chunk.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.335
Well, if female companionship
is the ultimate goal,

01:43.337 --> 01:45.704
then there's only one video
we shall make,

01:45.706 --> 01:49.408
a frame by frame
remake of 1979's

01:49.410 --> 01:52.044
<i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture.</i>

01:52.046 --> 01:54.580
I, obviously,
will be Captain Kirk.

01:54.582 --> 01:57.216
Jordan "Spock",
Chunk "Scotty."

01:57.218 --> 01:58.684
And I have all the costumes,
so I mean--

01:58.686 --> 02:00.419
Okay,
my dad didn't buy me

02:00.421 --> 02:03.856
that camera so that you could
get a hard on playing Spock.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.824
You're Spock, I'm Kirk.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.359
But, pray tell,

02:07.361 --> 02:10.128
what kind of video would
you like to make, Jordan?

02:11.831 --> 02:13.999
I'm getting
a girlfriend this year.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.567
Period.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.228
Happy birthday.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.396
Dang.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.531
Dang, what?

02:45.533 --> 02:46.965
Something came up.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.367
Dang!

02:48.369 --> 02:49.635
Connor?

02:49.637 --> 02:50.736
What did you do here?

02:50.738 --> 02:52.037
I'm trying to fix it.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.038
Fix what?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.406
It's brand new, Chunk.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.041
Brand new junk, maybe.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.110
You're vociferating
like a--Romulan.

02:58.112 --> 02:59.545
I'm not voc--okay,

02:59.547 --> 03:00.779
I don't even know
what that means.

03:00.781 --> 03:01.980
I think angering him.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.482
Okay, yeah.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.784
I was voc--because
I told you not to bring--

03:05.786 --> 03:06.919
Fascinating.

03:06.921 --> 03:08.787
My expertise says,

03:08.789 --> 03:11.423
"Captain, there's something
wrong with this bloody thing."

03:11.425 --> 03:13.158
Yeah, like no color, man.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.028
Fuck. Fuck!

03:19.632 --> 03:22.000
Your camera will be
repaired, okay?

03:22.002 --> 03:23.168
Finish your video.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.804
Hey,
we're here for you.

03:25.806 --> 03:28.173
Copacetic?

03:28.175 --> 03:30.075
Tell me a time
I've ever let you down before.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.513
All right,
can you hurry?

03:34.515 --> 03:35.814
Eve's birthday
is tomorrow, so...

03:35.816 --> 03:37.683
Eve Goodwin?

03:37.685 --> 03:42.454
We're doing all this
for Eve Goodwin?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.089
Here's the receipt.

03:44.091 --> 03:46.325
Don't lose it.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.618
You're paying for that,

04:12.620 --> 04:14.353
even if it means selling
every ounce of blood in that

04:14.355 --> 04:16.120
extra grande body of yours.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.356
It's not broke
no more, man.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.124
See? Dang.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.994
The only thing that's broken
is my nose, my glasses,

04:21.995 --> 04:24.129
and my dream of breaking
John Meringer's record

04:24.131 --> 04:26.064
of 12 <i>Star Trek Adventures</i>
<i>in a row.</i>

04:26.066 --> 04:27.633
Wait, but I thought
the doctor said

04:27.635 --> 04:29.301
that your nose would be good in,
like, 2 months.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.637
True, but my mother's making me
pay for new glasses

04:31.639 --> 04:35.474
from my own bank account
which means no money,

04:35.476 --> 04:39.011
no convention,
no collectibles, no justice.

04:39.013 --> 04:40.512
Quit it.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.347
Just making
sure we're good, man.

04:42.349 --> 04:45.384
Dax hit this pretty hard before
Connor caught it with his face.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.518
What?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.754
Dax Gaiman did this?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.589
What was he doing
at an electronic store?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.357
Cutting in front
of us in line.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.159
Snatching your camera away,

04:54.161 --> 04:56.028
appeasing his demented
sense of humor.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.529
So Connor says
something.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.530
Dax says something.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.531
So Connor shuts up.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.199
I was weighing my options.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.368
Then Dax yells "catch"
like Connor's face

05:03.370 --> 05:04.736
is a baseball
mitt or something.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.338
Ugh!

05:06.340 --> 05:08.774
The good news is,
camera works great now, man.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.009
What a dick.
I'll pay for your glasses.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.544
I appreciate that.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.681
The only person that should pay
needs to pay.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.516
How, man?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.384
He'll just steal our wallets
again like he always does.

05:19.386 --> 05:22.387
I'm referring
to emotional compensation.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.756
It's time we right some wrongs,
gentlemen.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.558
How, man?
He'll just beat us up again.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.559
Chunk.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.027
It's true.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.429
He's a Jesus freak.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.930
They're sadists.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.699
They like it
when everyone suffers.

05:33.701 --> 05:37.069
Then we need to
demonstrate how our brains

05:37.071 --> 05:38.804
are mightier than his brawn.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.075
Is this somehow
humorous to you?

05:43.077 --> 05:44.543
What is this?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.778
The Wild-Wild West?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.081
I mean, do we look like
vigilantes to you?

05:49.083 --> 05:51.416
We couldn't even
scare ourselves.

05:51.418 --> 05:53.719
Okay, maybe Chunk could.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.555
Let it go, all right?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.290
He's one bad apple.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.092
An eye for an eye
only makes everyone blind.

06:00.094 --> 06:04.162
The correct adage is one bad
apple spoils the barrel

06:04.164 --> 06:06.431
and you know
as well as I that

06:06.433 --> 06:08.734
this barrel's been
rotting for years.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.836
It's ripe for some change.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.305
Okay, there are kids
starving in Africa,

06:13.307 --> 06:15.941
dying of malaria, genocide,

06:15.943 --> 06:18.076
I mean, God knows what--

06:18.078 --> 06:19.745
what am I doing
debating Mr. Drugged out

06:19.747 --> 06:21.680
Frank Castle over here?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.683
Besides,
we have Eve's video to finish.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.084
Myopia also occurs
in people

06:26.086 --> 06:27.686
who think
they've fallen in love.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.954
Huh?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.355
That's Mother.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.491
Tomorrow at the park,
2:00 p.m.

06:32.493 --> 06:34.192
We'll clarify
the mission further.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.994
What mission?

06:37.497 --> 06:38.830
Kill Dax Gaiman.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.799
Coming, Mother.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.267
Metaphorically, of course.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.770
Wait, wait, wait.
What about Eve's video?

06:44.772 --> 06:46.605
As your best friend,
I suggest you move on.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.140
How can I without your help?

06:48.142 --> 06:49.608
Live long and prosper--

06:49.610 --> 06:51.143
Connor, seriously,
you promised.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.779
I can't run the rube
and film it by myself.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.480
This is lame!

06:55.482 --> 06:58.283
Really fucking lame.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.652
Yeah, so we saw Dax,
he was--

07:00.654 --> 07:01.787
Turn it off.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.924
Okay, but we saw--
Turn it off!

07:09.162 --> 07:10.362
As you might
have deduced,

07:10.364 --> 07:11.863
I was in a bit
of a carefree state

07:11.865 --> 07:13.532
when I authored
this last night

07:13.534 --> 07:16.668
but hopefully, you got
the gist of my email which is,

07:16.670 --> 07:20.305
this mission, I hope to
accomplish the following.

07:21.307 --> 07:24.142
And immediately after,

07:24.144 --> 07:26.678
so that everyone,
and I mean everyone sees

07:26.680 --> 07:29.748
that we boldly went where no
man or woman has gone before,

07:29.750 --> 07:31.817
besting Dax Gaiman.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.453
And with the anticipated
amount of views, we'll...

07:35.321 --> 07:37.255
So in a nutshell,

07:37.257 --> 07:40.192
our next <i>Star Trek</i> convention
will be completely subsidized.

07:40.194 --> 07:41.827
Thanks, Dax.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.894
What's that look for?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.030
What look?

07:45.032 --> 07:47.065
It's how I look, deal.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.433
He's angry
because we didn't help him

07:48.435 --> 07:49.935
finish his video.
I offered to help, but--

07:49.937 --> 07:52.437
Okay, you is what made it
unfinished,

07:52.439 --> 07:54.206
and that's only part
of the reason.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.708
Pray tell the other.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.444
You've lost
your fucking mind.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.046
I mean, what happened
to all that <i>Star Trek</i>

08:01.048 --> 08:02.714
crap you're always
blabbering about?

08:02.716 --> 08:05.717
Logic and non violence
to solve life's problems.

08:05.719 --> 08:06.952
Sound familiar?

08:06.954 --> 08:09.221
This is logical
and non violent.

08:09.223 --> 08:11.957
But if you're inferring
some sort of hypocrisy,

08:11.959 --> 08:14.926
need I remind you, 3rd grade,
Miss Miller, Dax and I,

08:14.928 --> 08:16.461
20 minute pow-wow.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.431
5th grade, Principal Skyler,
a one hour discussion.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.600
8th grade, Dax's parents,
my mother,

08:21.602 --> 08:24.936
a two hour intervention
all of which leads us to here.

08:24.938 --> 08:30.408
Now Dax and us
and everyone

08:30.410 --> 08:32.244
that pumps
a little Klingon blood,

08:32.246 --> 08:33.979
a little warrior spirit.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.881
In special circumstances
like this,

08:35.883 --> 08:38.984
one needs to channel it
as long as one controls it.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.253
Yeah, well, you have
more than just a little.

08:41.255 --> 08:42.988
Um, guys?

08:42.990 --> 08:45.490
Prod-brain,
you devious fuck!

08:45.492 --> 08:47.626
And I rest my case.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.594
Touché, hombre.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.396
You made a funny.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.331
Don't fuckin' run,
asshole!

08:53.333 --> 08:55.734
He was referring to me,
Chunk.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.403
Time we beam away too.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.005
Coming?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.840
I wasn't planning
anything devious.

09:01.842 --> 09:02.841
Suit yourself.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.409
Yo!
Where you going?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.011
Pacifism, Connor.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.914
Learn it, live it,
love it.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.788
This recording?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.523
I said
this shit recording?

09:18.525 --> 09:20.091
You mean you asked.
Ah.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.293
You know what I mean,
smart-ass.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.028
It is! It is!
I think it is. Yes.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.796
Oh, you are one retarded negro.
You know that?

09:24.798 --> 09:26.531
Did you see how many
buttons are on that shit?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.933
A lot.
Let him go.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.301
He has nothing
to do with this.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.102
And just be clear,

09:31.104 --> 09:32.537
even though I'm not equipped
with my custom fabricated

09:32.539 --> 09:34.005
dog tags right now,

09:34.007 --> 09:35.640
my hands are deadly weapons
all by themselves.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.442
Since I'm a master
of the ancient Armenian

09:37.444 --> 09:39.144
karate stance Du Kan Du.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.147
And just to be clear,
again.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.649
It's self defense
if I kill you both.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.284
Why you always fuckin'
with me, cry baby?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.652
It's the other way
around, nimrod.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.821
Oh, you see what I mean?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.656
What the fuck
did I ever do to you, huh?

09:51.658 --> 09:53.458
Are you suffering
from acute amnesia?

09:53.460 --> 09:56.461
My nose, my glasses, almost
a decade's worth of emotional

09:56.463 --> 09:57.562
and physical torment.

09:57.564 --> 09:58.830
Stay away!

09:58.832 --> 10:00.198
Oh, I think
I need to teach this boy

10:00.200 --> 10:01.833
about forgiving
and forgetting.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.835
Somebody's gots to.
Stay away!

10:03.837 --> 10:06.071
I'm not responsible
for my attack maneuvers.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.305
Ow!

10:07.307 --> 10:08.340
Ow!

10:08.342 --> 10:09.841
Apologize.
Ow, for what?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.242
For what?

10:11.244 --> 10:12.677
Let's go down
the fuckin' list.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.346
First, your stupid
fuckin' plan

10:14.348 --> 10:16.815
to try to make me you,
embarrassing.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.583
And second,
for your dad knocking up

10:18.585 --> 10:20.685
that slutty fat
fuckin' sister of his

10:20.687 --> 10:22.687
and for that bitch
not getting an abortion.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.723
But thirdly
and most importantly,

10:24.725 --> 10:30.095
the use of your hairy, nasty,
STD-infected fuckin' cunt

10:30.097 --> 10:32.230
making all of our lives
so fuckin' miserable.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.865
So go ahead, little bitch.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.233
We're all eyes and ears.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.202
Do it,
Connor, just apologize.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.504
I'm not inbred, idiot,
my parents met at Bible camp.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.872
Oh, if you're not inbred,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.273
then how the fuck
do you explain you?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.342
The only difference between
me and you, Dax,

10:44.344 --> 10:46.378
is there was no orgy
of midget baboons

10:46.380 --> 10:48.446
involved in my conception.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.248
I think I need to teach him
a lesson to his face too.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.852
Ah, help.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.220
Jordan, help!

10:55.222 --> 10:58.356
Smart, smart-ass.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.492
Chill, you next.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.031
D?

11:06.033 --> 11:07.866
Yo, D, man.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.635
D!
D, let's go.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.271
Come on, let go, man.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.409
Oh, oh, no.

11:18.911 --> 11:22.047
You're gonna blame
the black guy.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.250
Oh!
Damn.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.785
Think he learned his lesson?

11:26.787 --> 11:30.388
Man, for his sake,
I hope so.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.065
Well, go ahead.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.067
Look, they erased it all.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.635
It's on.

11:43.637 --> 11:46.304
I had to apologize
and buy Dax Gaiman a fucking

11:46.306 --> 11:47.472
Chili's gift card
just to get this back.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.573
It's recording.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.975
So why would
I upload that video?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.444
Why would you?

11:52.446 --> 11:53.812
Not like you just stood
there and allowed them

11:53.814 --> 11:55.580
to do it to me
in the first place.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.515
I was cornered.

11:57.517 --> 12:01.152
I mean, they're thuggish
and you could have apologized.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.922
Stupider stuff
has come out of your mouth.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.924
Ow!
What the--

12:05.926 --> 12:07.826
It's not like you helped me
when I needed it.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.328
So out of sheer spite,
you backstabbed us?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.329
What?

12:11.331 --> 12:12.797
No.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.699
Then how did Dax know
about the mission, huh?

12:14.701 --> 12:16.968
He knew it so well
he copied it verbatim.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.203
I--I don't know.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.871
I didn't
tell him anything.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.606
I hate him as much--
But you did tell
Eve Goodwin.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.211
It might have slipped.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.712
But what does that have
to do with anything?

12:27.714 --> 12:29.714
Because of your weakness
and stupidity,

12:29.716 --> 12:32.350
I'm now the internet's most
infamous shit face.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.718
Ow, fuck!
It's not my fault!

12:33.720 --> 12:34.853
Ow!

12:38.991 --> 12:40.825
Dax, I must say,
thank you.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.127
Thank you very much.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.862
I've indeed
learned my lesson.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.364
The lesson?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.233
Don't worry,
it's not in Klingon although,

12:48.235 --> 12:50.835
it is in a language
you barely comprehend.

12:55.641 --> 12:57.642
"Purge the evil
from among you.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.511
The rest of the people
will hear about this

12:59.513 --> 13:01.212
and be afraid

13:01.214 --> 13:03.848
and never again will such
an evil thing be done among you.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.652
Show no pity,
life for life, eye for eye,

13:07.654 --> 13:09.754
tooth for tooth."

13:09.756 --> 13:14.025
So, Dax, be afraid,
be very afraid

13:14.027 --> 13:16.494
because as Captain Kirk said
in the <i>Return of the Archons,</i>

13:16.496 --> 13:18.163
you are the evil.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.532
The evil must be destroyed.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.634
Correct, Jordan?

13:31.510 --> 13:33.178
Focused?

13:33.180 --> 13:35.547
Okay.
Cue music.

13:35.549 --> 13:37.182
Make sure
it's the proper track.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.285
Dax needs to understand
we mean business.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.796
Hear that, Dax?

13:51.798 --> 13:54.199
Class is in session
and you'll soon discover

13:54.201 --> 13:55.700
No, this is not
math or English

13:55.702 --> 13:59.571
but something even rougher
involving this.

13:59.573 --> 14:04.909
This and you.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.145
So let me
unlock the first lesson,

14:07.147 --> 14:11.449
deception in the school
of hard knocks.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.451
Focus, we mean business.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.986
It's a little hard
when I can't breathe.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.221
My apologies.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.722
It must have
shrunken in the wash.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.591
Yes, so are my balls
in this thing.

14:19.593 --> 14:22.460
You guys hear that?

14:22.462 --> 14:27.332
2,200 SAT, 130 IQ
and this is the best you can do?

14:27.334 --> 14:28.600
Really?

14:28.602 --> 14:30.468
Like the great Gene
Roddenberry,

14:30.470 --> 14:31.803
I understand my audience

14:31.805 --> 14:33.071
and he's currently
at a 5th grade

14:33.073 --> 14:35.106
vocabulary level,
if not lower.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.941
Plus from my sources,

14:36.943 --> 14:38.443
I hear he's definitely
afraid of clowns.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.478
No, no, I'm talking
about this whole thing.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.748
This whole behind
the scenes look, I mean why?

14:43.750 --> 14:47.485
Are we making a special
edition DVD too?

14:47.487 --> 14:50.355
Practice and patience
and you would see,

14:50.357 --> 14:52.857
this is for the most important
phase of the prank,

14:52.859 --> 14:54.592
the execution.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.463
The change in power between
our victim and ourselves.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.265
Huh?

15:00.267 --> 15:03.001
This is for Dax to realize
he's been humiliated

15:03.003 --> 15:05.136
by some serious gangsters.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.271
Who?

15:06.273 --> 15:07.505
Us.

15:07.507 --> 15:08.773
Us?

15:08.775 --> 15:10.375
Seriously?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.110
We're seriously
out of our league.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.280
Enough, your pedantic attitude
is starting to annoy me.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.249
Chunk.

15:22.388 --> 15:26.291
Now we all know you've
claimed this as your domain.

15:26.293 --> 15:27.492
But why?

15:27.494 --> 15:29.027
Why, why, why?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.628
Why is this yours to claim?

15:30.630 --> 15:32.397
You're allowed access
weekends and nights

15:32.399 --> 15:33.865
when no one else can.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.000
You say, quote,
"You're cool with coach,"

15:36.002 --> 15:37.402
but my sources tell me,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.170
coach Reed's side
catering business

15:39.172 --> 15:41.372
gets a hearty discount
from your uncle's butcher shop

15:41.374 --> 15:45.143
which makes me think something
deceptive is going on here.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.678
Run it again, man.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.747
But, Dax, my friend,
deception cuts both ways.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.817
See you tomorrow night,
when you'll learn the hard way.

15:53.819 --> 15:57.021
That was your cue.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.057
Jordan?

15:59.059 --> 16:01.025
Idiot.

16:01.027 --> 16:04.929
And in your confusion,
you wander out here.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.332
And surprise, surprise.

16:07.334 --> 16:12.036
A light and sound show,
you will indeed fear

16:12.038 --> 16:14.072
but keep open them
eyes and ears

16:14.074 --> 16:17.041
for it's our intention
to bring you to tears.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.945
Where did that come from?

16:20.947 --> 16:22.914
Don't tell me it's loaded.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.349
Chunk's aunt's pawn shop.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.418
And yes, it is loaded
not with bullets,

16:27.420 --> 16:29.454
but with psychological
intimidation.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.222
Fancy, man.
Thank you, Chunk.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.459
Okay, I'm requesting
leave of absence.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.861
I don't have the proper
stupidity to continue.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.864
You mean your stupidity
is making you not see

16:39.866 --> 16:41.599
this prank is fool proof.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.301
Fool proof?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.569
What about the cameras?

16:44.571 --> 16:47.105
Uh, duh.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.240
No.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.742
Duh.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.944
And the sprinklers?

16:52.946 --> 16:57.115
duh, and the fire alarms
after these M-80s pop?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.483
duh.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.817
Fool proof?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.986
Only proves
who's the fool here.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.255
Duh.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.959
Hey, summer
school's over.

17:07.961 --> 17:10.328
Take your costume party
someplace else.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.430
I told you guys
I heard something.

17:22.742 --> 17:29.547
Okay, um, so music
starts and...

17:33.519 --> 17:35.286
Fuck!

17:35.288 --> 17:37.021
Fuck, no,

17:37.023 --> 17:41.793
there's supposed to be
fuckin' balloons and confetti.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.128
Sorry, Eve.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.501
What's with
the goofy costume?

17:50.503 --> 17:54.038
<i>Benny and Joon, I thought</i>
<i>you said you loved Johnny Depp</i>

17:54.040 --> 17:57.542
<i>in Benny and Joon.</i>

17:57.544 --> 17:59.877
Johnny Depp's cool
and Benny Hill's funny

17:59.879 --> 18:01.546
but who's <i>Benny and Joon?</i>

18:01.548 --> 18:02.947
A band?

18:02.949 --> 18:04.549
<i>This was Connor's idea.</i>

18:04.551 --> 18:06.951
He's the idea guy.
Shit face did this?

18:06.953 --> 18:10.321
Oh, you've, um,
you've seen the video?

18:10.323 --> 18:11.823
Everyone's seen the video.

18:11.825 --> 18:13.324
He totally deserved it
though.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.460
Hope he finally
learned his lesson.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.961
Yeah, right.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.831
Did you know he almost
ruined my life last semester?

18:19.833 --> 18:21.699
He published a full page
story of me starring

18:21.701 --> 18:24.068
and directing Macbeth
from the front page

18:24.070 --> 18:26.204
to the back page
of the school paper.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.472
Actually, he just
posted that--

18:27.474 --> 18:30.708
My mom was Lady Macbeth
in off Broadway.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.344
My friends were gonna put
t-shirts of my front page on it.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.848
They all look up to me
and I was completely humiliated.

18:36.850 --> 18:39.917
I'm sorry.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.920
Why do you spend so much
time with that loser anyways?

18:42.922 --> 18:44.422
I don't know.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.723
Stupidity?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.092
You should make new friends.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.695
Like cool friends.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.230
Like my friends.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.998
Oh, okay.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.833
Okay.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.236
So you have something
for me, sweetie?

18:58.238 --> 19:01.239
Oh, uh, yeah,
I almost forgot.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.109
Happy birthday.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.577
Oh, my God,
you shouldn't have--

19:06.579 --> 19:07.945
I'm sorry it's late.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.381
What is it
a gift card?

19:10.383 --> 19:11.516
Oh.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.750
You like it?

19:12.752 --> 19:15.219
Oh, it's not a gift card.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.387
Well, put it on.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.522
No, I'm cool.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.957
Here,

19:19.959 --> 19:22.260
it's an antique.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.897
It's been in the family for
three generations, I think.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.533
It's even got
diamonds on it.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.635
Real diamonds?

19:30.637 --> 19:33.171
I love it, thank you.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.942
Oh, my God,
what the hell?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.043
It's just Connor.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.645
What do you want?
Okay.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.914
Um, I'll be right back.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.650
<i>Hold your horses.</i>

19:45.652 --> 19:47.285
<i>This is why</i>
<i>you've been dodging me?</i>

19:47.287 --> 19:48.786
<i>What does she know?</i>
<i>What'd you tell her?</i>

19:48.788 --> 19:50.288
<i>What'd he tell you?</i>

19:50.290 --> 19:52.256
Happy birthday?
I should get to work.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.125
Stop acting innocent,
you conniving bitch!

19:54.127 --> 19:55.660
Oh, my God,
what's wrong with him?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.628
Don't you dare judge me,
cunt.
Jordan.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.163
Take that back.
You take that back.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.431
Take what back?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.066
I swear on the honor
of the Klingon code,

20:02.068 --> 20:04.168
if you tell Dax
our plan--
Stay away!

20:04.170 --> 20:07.905
Ow, you bitch!

20:07.907 --> 20:09.574
Are you okay?
No!

20:11.276 --> 20:12.910
I swear, I've never
struck a girl before,

20:12.912 --> 20:14.645
let alone
a fairytale character,

20:14.647 --> 20:16.447
but if my nose
is broken again...

20:18.584 --> 20:21.953
Tell him, Jordan.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.321
Tell me what?

20:23.323 --> 20:25.456
Well.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.793
Stay away, Connor.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.761
From both of us.

20:30.763 --> 20:31.829
You're that dense?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.364
She's cavorting with Dax,

20:33.366 --> 20:34.699
we saw him at the
electronic store holding hands.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.167
We're friends, asshole.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.301
Like that's any of your
business anyways,

20:37.303 --> 20:38.603
you nosy prick.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.870
We would have
told you before, we just

20:39.872 --> 20:41.706
didn't think
you'd handle it.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.608
Well?

20:43.610 --> 20:46.310
Well, I can't kick him out
right now.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.212
What if his nose
is broken again?

20:48.214 --> 20:49.480
Enjoy your kiss
and make up, then.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.615
Eve, wait.

20:55.354 --> 20:57.054
What a fool.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.356
Eve!

21:01.627 --> 21:02.960
Connor?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.741
Jordan?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.376
Jordan?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.645
I'm apologizing
straight to camera.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.713
You watching?

21:22.715 --> 21:23.848
I'm only doing
this for you.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.220
Eve, I overreacted.

21:29.222 --> 21:30.388
I shouldn't have
called you a cunt.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.056
You're not.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.892
You're just using my friend
here for his money.

21:34.894 --> 21:41.532
So for my poor
choice of words, I apologize.

21:43.402 --> 21:46.103
What I should have
called you is a whore.

21:46.105 --> 21:49.173
There, done. Copacetic?

21:53.011 --> 21:54.779
You remember Barnes?

21:54.781 --> 21:57.415
That obese kid in second grade
used to squat over your face

21:57.417 --> 22:03.287
and fart until you surrendered
your lunch money?

22:03.289 --> 22:07.024
That happened what?
Three months straight?

22:07.026 --> 22:09.393
Until someone came over
and screamed "rape, rape, rape!"

22:09.395 --> 22:12.196
so loud and so often
that they transferred him out.

22:13.565 --> 22:14.765
You remember that?

22:19.071 --> 22:20.905
I know you do.
That's how we became friends.

22:23.442 --> 22:27.712
Look, I don't attest
to being perfect.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.313
You perfectly
fucked up my life.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.582
But I'm trying my best.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.417
I understand you've
had a crush on Eve

22:33.419 --> 22:37.788
since the 5th grade
and but to be honest,

22:37.790 --> 22:40.725
for you the female species
has been quite elusive.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.794
Okay, stop, stop,
fucking stop.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.497
Stop acting like
you fucking care.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.732
All right?

22:47.734 --> 22:50.234
That Connor,
my friend, he's--

22:50.236 --> 22:52.737
he's dead because
you're not him.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.972
You've changed.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.475
You only care about
one thing now.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.843
You.

22:58.845 --> 22:59.844
You're completely blinded.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.445
Am I?

23:01.447 --> 23:03.114
I mean, how much are you
gonna blindly sacrifice

23:03.116 --> 23:05.082
for this bullshit
revenge you want?

23:05.084 --> 23:08.386
Your friends, your future,
your sanity?

23:11.123 --> 23:17.361
I'm waiting for the strings,
but yes, if I must, I will.

23:17.363 --> 23:18.596
I didn't initiate this.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.765
Yeah,
but you'll continue it.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.466
Over and over
and over again.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.002
It'll never stop,
you'll never beat Dax Gaiman

23:25.004 --> 23:27.772
because you're no better
than him and you know it.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.774
Done?

23:29.776 --> 23:31.675
Yeah, I'm done.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.377
And so is our friendship.

23:33.379 --> 23:37.348
No, no, no, no, Jordan,
you owe me for the many years,

23:37.350 --> 23:39.917
months, and days
that I stood by your side.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.720
It's the least you can do.

23:42.722 --> 23:46.023
There's a difference between
revenge and justice, you know.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.366
Since this is your plan
we're adopting now,

23:55.368 --> 23:57.635
wouldn't it make more sense
for you to do the prologue?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.170
But you're such a natural.

23:59.172 --> 24:00.905
Touché.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.508
Second lesson in the school
of hard knocks, Dax, theatrics.

24:04.510 --> 24:06.343
For instance, Jordan and I
in keeping with the adage

24:06.345 --> 24:08.245
"the show must go on,"

24:08.247 --> 24:10.748
we've set aside past differences
to concentrate on the future.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.317
The future? Your demise.

24:13.319 --> 24:14.452
The plan?

24:17.189 --> 24:18.923
Not exactly ingenious--

24:18.925 --> 24:21.192
But it'll do.

24:21.194 --> 24:23.561
So, Dax, be afraid.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.163
Be very afraid.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.932
When are we picking up Chunk?

24:27.934 --> 24:30.034
She'll need to be briefed
on this ingenious plan as well.

24:30.036 --> 24:32.436
No, no, Chunk.
No more screw-ups.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.071
She made one mistake once.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.073
Does everybody need to be
as perfect as Eve now?

24:36.075 --> 24:38.943
I'm volunteering here,
remember that.

24:38.945 --> 24:41.412
Your apathy for me is
duly been noted. Pray tell,

24:41.414 --> 24:43.347
what has Chunk done to deserve
this kind of treatment?

24:43.349 --> 24:46.717
She's dumb,
she's poor, she's uncool.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.353
She is the same exact person
you introduced to me

24:49.355 --> 24:50.855
5 years ago when you said,

24:50.857 --> 24:52.723
"Can Chunk
join us for lunch please?"

24:52.725 --> 24:55.226
She's not my fucking friend
anymore, all right?

24:56.862 --> 24:58.596
Period.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.864
It sounds to me
like I'm not the only one

24:59.866 --> 25:01.432
undergoing metamorphosis.

25:01.434 --> 25:04.368
No fucking friend would...

25:04.370 --> 25:06.070
Continue.

25:11.743 --> 25:14.144
Chunk? You?

25:14.146 --> 25:15.746
Fascinating.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.882
You know, I thought
she only lusted after women.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.951
I guess the only thing I could
say is tongue or no tongue?

25:20.953 --> 25:22.486
Yeah, yeah,
laugh it up.

25:22.488 --> 25:23.988
At least I don't
go around telling people

25:23.990 --> 25:26.991
how fucking cool
<i>Star Trek</i> is in public.

25:26.993 --> 25:30.461
You used to, Jordan,
and don't act like you didn't.

25:30.463 --> 25:33.464
And you used to know
what a joke was too.

25:33.466 --> 25:36.233
Perseverance, means
finish what you start.

25:40.238 --> 25:42.907
And this is not humorous!

25:42.909 --> 25:44.375
Jordan!

25:50.248 --> 25:52.516
Assuming you're appeasing
your fetish of bouncing large

25:52.518 --> 25:54.018
orange balls right now,

25:54.020 --> 25:56.420
we decided to bring
our last lesson,

25:56.422 --> 25:59.023
straight to your living room.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.659
That lesson, Dax,

26:01.661 --> 26:03.994
mayhem.

26:03.996 --> 26:05.930
Are you done
with the bullshit?

26:05.932 --> 26:06.997
If you're referring
to your attitude,

26:06.999 --> 26:09.567
yes, I most certainly am.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.084
Well?

27:00.086 --> 27:01.719
Well, you officially
belong on the short bus,

27:01.721 --> 27:03.387
what can I say?

27:03.389 --> 27:06.323
This isn't a specular sport.
Make yourself useful.

27:08.426 --> 27:11.228
This is so fucking stupid.

27:23.608 --> 27:26.076
I said mayhem,
not decorative arts.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.378
Here.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.879
Can't we discuss this?

27:28.881 --> 27:30.748
What's there to discuss?
They're eggs.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.617
Throw them.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.119
At the house.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.620
I know.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.255
My apologies for assuming
your complete idiocy.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.524
Fuck you.

27:40.526 --> 27:43.027
Fuck you, Chunk.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.129
Fuck you, Dax.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.130
Fuck you all.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.531
Mayhem.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.634
Someone's inside.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.102
Who?

28:00.645 --> 28:02.112
I see...

28:02.114 --> 28:03.781
Who?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.215
Paranoia,
there's nobody there.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.650
I'm done.

28:06.652 --> 28:10.287
No, we're not even
halfway done yet.

28:17.896 --> 28:21.799
Is anybody out there?

28:24.169 --> 28:26.437
Oh, wait,

28:26.439 --> 28:28.405
somebody was
enjoying themselves.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.577
Profusely.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.946
Oh, crap.
What?

28:35.948 --> 28:38.782
Is anybody
in Dax's family black?

28:38.784 --> 28:40.117
Might explain
his wiggerness.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.452
Come on, let's go.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.087
Wait, let me raise the game.

28:43.089 --> 28:45.089
Oh, crap.
Shit.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.191
Oh, my god.
Fucking abandon ship.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.593
Oh, my God.
Retreat! Run away!

28:49.595 --> 28:53.030
Connor, come on!
We got it.
We got it.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.932
Connor,
what are you doing?

28:54.934 --> 28:57.034
Turn the camera off.
It's the biggest
day of my life.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.737
Connor!
I think I might ejaculate
in my pants right now.

29:05.443 --> 29:07.478
Dax, we now possess
the very thing

29:07.480 --> 29:10.447
that will bring you
to your knees.

29:10.449 --> 29:11.982
So to speak.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.318
That'll make everyone
see you for who you are,

29:14.320 --> 29:19.456
not all American jockey boy.
No, a flaming fraud.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.724
And there's only
one small man

29:20.726 --> 29:23.827
that stands between us
and justice

29:23.829 --> 29:25.629
or should I say
one giant idiot.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.131
Hand over the cable, Jordan.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.366
"Distrust all in whom
the impulse

29:29.368 --> 29:31.235
to punish is powerful

29:31.237 --> 29:33.137
and if your friend
does evil to you,

29:33.139 --> 29:36.006
say to him, 'I forgive you
for what you did to me

29:36.008 --> 29:38.008
but how can I forgive you
for what you did to yourself?''

29:38.010 --> 29:39.510
Where is it, Jordan?

29:39.512 --> 29:42.146
"Battle not with monsters,
lest you become one."

29:42.148 --> 29:44.014
It's your book.
Ow! God.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.717
Next time you get your face
shoved into a bowl of excrement,

29:46.719 --> 29:48.252
I'll let you lecture me
on rally.

29:48.254 --> 29:52.589
Until then--
My dad's gay.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.258
He's on a quote un-quote,

29:54.260 --> 29:58.529
business trip with a quote
un-quote, internet friend.

29:58.531 --> 30:01.398
And that has pertinence
to this how?

30:06.237 --> 30:08.172
What is this? 1995?

30:08.174 --> 30:09.673
Jordan, are you on dial-up?

30:21.419 --> 30:23.053
Something humorous?

30:24.122 --> 30:25.923
You.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.157
Me.

30:28.927 --> 30:31.929
Us rubes.

30:31.931 --> 30:36.433
All these little maneuverings
for what?

30:36.435 --> 30:38.569
Something that was
right there.

30:38.571 --> 30:41.205
Right in front of our faces.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.208
I don't comprehend.

30:44.210 --> 30:48.212
You and this
self-satisfaction.

30:48.214 --> 30:52.549
Me knowing
I was right all along.

30:52.551 --> 30:57.321
Eve and Dax, they're friends.
Just friends.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.289
Sorry, friendo.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.725
All tonight proves
is Dax is greedy in love

31:01.727 --> 31:02.726
as he is
in everything else.

31:09.601 --> 31:13.070
Don't let the door
hit your nose on the way out.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.573
I take no joy in being
the bearer of bad news.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.609
Tell these procurer
a slice of...

31:18.611 --> 31:19.977
pizza by the park...

31:21.113 --> 31:23.113
Shit.
Connor?

31:26.118 --> 31:27.184
Who is it?

31:28.754 --> 31:30.187
Who do you think?
Open
the fucking door!

31:30.189 --> 31:31.355
I know you faggots are there.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.523
Oh, crap.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.092
Open the fucking door

31:35.094 --> 31:36.693
or I'm going to kick this
fucking thing down.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.595
- Okay. All right.
- What are you doing?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.464
What?
My dad's gonna kill me
if he actually does it.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.132
He's gonna kill me
if he actually opens it.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.433
Just give him the camera.
That's all he wants.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.637
Coming. I'm coming.
All right.
Open the fucking door!

31:46.639 --> 31:49.006
All right, idiot, okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.274
All right. All right.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.642
What the fuck?

31:51.644 --> 31:53.277
Where the fuck's
the camera, huh?

31:57.015 --> 31:58.649
Ah, bitch.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.519
Connor, Connor,
what the fuck are you doing?

32:04.522 --> 32:06.890
Fuck.

32:06.892 --> 32:08.792
You and your
fucking inner Klingon.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.133
Pop quiz.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.368
Given the choice of having
embarrassing footage of you

32:18.370 --> 32:21.905
uploaded albeit on the slowest
DSL line known to man

32:21.907 --> 32:24.408
or apologizing directly
to those you've wronged

32:24.410 --> 32:26.543
and swearing
to never do it again,

32:26.545 --> 32:28.645
which would you choose,
Daxy boy?

32:30.014 --> 32:31.548
You're in frame, Jordan.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.550
There's blood on
the fucking floor, Connor.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.319
And white trash bags will
of course conceal that.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.321
Okay, it's the first thing
I found, all right?

32:37.323 --> 32:39.189
We don't normally
use my dad's workshop

32:39.191 --> 32:40.657
to hold people
fucking hostage.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.259
Oh, so letting them go
and pretending like

32:42.261 --> 32:44.161
none of this ever happened
would solve everything?

32:44.163 --> 32:46.897
Well, it wouldn't have added,
uh, false imprisonment

32:46.899 --> 32:50.334
and assault and battery
to our rap sheet.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.768
All caught on tape,
of course.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.070
Congratulations.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.705
You just set
a new world record

32:54.707 --> 32:57.341
for the lowest IQ of any member
of the mammal family.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.942
This is collateral.

32:58.944 --> 33:02.412
That he can't ever,
won't ever bully us again.

33:02.414 --> 33:04.715
He never bullied me.

33:04.717 --> 33:06.717
You're too stupid
to notice it.

33:06.719 --> 33:07.718
What?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.454
Oh, fuck.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.723
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

33:12.725 --> 33:16.960
Nowhere until we come
to a little consensus.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.229
Jordan, a little help.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.737
Shut up.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.306
We make your--

33:29.308 --> 33:32.442
to rear entry only,
a lost classic

33:32.444 --> 33:35.746
if you apologize for everything
you've ever done to us.

33:35.748 --> 33:36.813
All right?

33:36.815 --> 33:38.382
And for cavorting with Eve.

33:38.384 --> 33:39.483
Connor.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.885
Directly to camera.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.121
Agreed?

33:44.123 --> 33:45.589
What camera?

33:48.493 --> 33:50.460
Ew.
God.

33:50.462 --> 33:54.131
For the sake of magnanimity,
I'll let that go.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.632
What are you doing?

33:55.634 --> 33:57.234
Making sure everybody
gets a good look at this.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.469
This ain't fuckin'
Sesame Street, cry baby.

33:59.471 --> 34:00.637
Whenever you're ready,
Daxy boy.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.773
Fuck you. Help!

34:02.775 --> 34:05.776
Help! Help!
Shut up!
Jordan, shut him up!

34:05.778 --> 34:07.511
Do something!
Like what?
Help!

34:07.513 --> 34:10.013
I swear I'm gonna
hit you if you don't shut up!

34:10.014 --> 34:12.282
Fucking genius!
Shut up
before I hit you too!

34:14.284 --> 34:15.485
Fuck you!

34:15.487 --> 34:17.353
Connor.

34:17.356 --> 34:21.257
Connor, maybe you shouldn't,
um--maybe we shouldn't watch.

34:21.260 --> 34:25.027
Ah, God,
he's got a hard head.

34:25.030 --> 34:26.630
Wow.

34:26.632 --> 34:30.300
Never seen anybody
get punched like that before.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.668
It's kind of weird.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.804
Gag him.

34:33.806 --> 34:35.371
What?
Gag him.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.873
Why?

34:36.875 --> 34:38.942
So there's no repeat of the
banshee act, idiot.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.944
Fuck.

34:42.313 --> 34:45.014
Feels like a brick wall.

34:45.016 --> 34:48.952
Mm. Mm.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.456
He can still talk.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.024
It's 'cause you're
doing it wrong.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.292
Of course.

34:57.328 --> 35:00.530
He said he was gonna shove his
ass cheeks down our throats.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.165
Is that even possible?
Shut up!

35:02.167 --> 35:03.800
Hold it!

35:05.337 --> 35:07.170
Bastard!

35:16.481 --> 35:17.848
Give me the gun.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.685
I said get me the gun.
Go.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.487
Stop.
I hate that.

35:27.725 --> 35:30.694
Emotional compensation,
that's all I want.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.231
Better plans?

35:36.602 --> 35:38.201
Fuck!

35:41.339 --> 35:43.006
Don't act belligerent.

35:44.509 --> 35:46.243
Stop!

35:51.015 --> 35:53.016
All I wanted
was an apology.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.020
One simple apology.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.527
9 years...

36:03.529 --> 36:05.896
never once
did I insult you.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.967
Never once did
I attack you.

36:10.969 --> 36:15.038
Never once did I really do
anything to you.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.474
But for those 9 years
you went out of your way

36:17.476 --> 36:20.410
to make my life
a goddamn fucking hell!

36:23.915 --> 36:26.116
Every goddamn
fucking day.

36:29.921 --> 36:34.291
Every fucking minute
you humiliated me

36:34.293 --> 36:36.760
and every one
of my fucking friends.

36:39.263 --> 36:40.997
Why?

36:40.999 --> 36:42.699
You tell me why.

36:45.436 --> 36:47.070
Hmm?

36:49.907 --> 36:51.408
Fucking pussy.

36:57.448 --> 36:58.782
You're right.

36:58.784 --> 37:02.085
I never gave you an
incentive to stop,

37:02.087 --> 37:03.820
until now.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.823
Frame up a good shot.

37:06.825 --> 37:09.326
Of what?

37:09.328 --> 37:12.028
Six chambers, one bullet.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.597
That means--
Connor, there's no--

37:13.599 --> 37:15.599
Shut up!

37:15.601 --> 37:18.435
You got five chances at most
to say what you need to say.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.603
Now.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.039
Oh, wait.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.474
Cue music.

37:24.476 --> 37:27.110
What music?

37:27.112 --> 37:29.179
A requiem.

37:29.181 --> 37:31.348
This is so stupid.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.486
Good.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.487
Now--

37:42.193 --> 37:45.195
One.

37:50.234 --> 37:52.836
Two.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.504
You fuckin' pussy.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.373
You really think
you're gonna make it to five?

38:03.848 --> 38:04.848
Look.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.383
His    <i>Deer Hunter</i>

38:06.385 --> 38:10.086
is way better than
your <i>Benny and Joon.</i>

38:10.088 --> 38:12.522
Well, we spoke too soon.

38:12.524 --> 38:13.990
Look who just
sprung a leak.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.526
Fuck you.

38:16.528 --> 38:20.664
Unlike you, Dax, I take no joy
in embarrassing others.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.901
Okay. Maybe a little.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.603
Just this once.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.239
Fuck you.

38:38.883 --> 38:41.184
But ask yourself,

38:41.186 --> 38:44.287
how lucky
can one man really be?

38:44.289 --> 38:46.690
Do I want blood on my hands?

38:46.692 --> 38:48.058
Nope.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.694
Jordon?

38:50.696 --> 38:51.928
Didn't think so.

38:53.931 --> 38:55.565
Dax?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.067
Fuck you!

38:58.903 --> 39:00.704
Not very eloquent,
are you?

39:03.207 --> 39:06.643
Leaves us no choice.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.912
Ow.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.717
Do you--do you hear that?

39:13.719 --> 39:15.318
No.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.420
I'm only standing like
this because I have a cramp.

39:17.422 --> 39:18.922
Is that your father?
Help!

39:18.924 --> 39:20.490
Shut up.
Help.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.092
He's not supposed to be back
for another week.

39:22.094 --> 39:25.929
Help! Help me! Help!

39:25.931 --> 39:27.664
Shut up!

39:27.666 --> 39:29.733
Fuck.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.738
It's probably the pizza guy.
Go pay him.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.606
Pizza.

39:36.608 --> 39:39.743
Now we can continue
this party all night long.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.980
What are you doing?
Planting roots?

39:43.982 --> 39:46.483
Go!
What if it's the police?

39:46.485 --> 39:48.618
Why would police
need to alarm their own cars?

39:49.754 --> 39:52.489
No, you go, here.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.757
But why?

39:53.759 --> 39:55.091
Here, just take it.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.993
I don't even--go.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.496
Hurry.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.331
I don't even have
any money.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.276
Oh, crap.

40:13.278 --> 40:16.513
Jordan.

40:16.515 --> 40:20.216
You know your front door's
in a really awful shape.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.518
I'm sorry
I lost my temper

40:21.520 --> 40:24.220
but I'm not leaving
until we talk.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.990
Crap. He's not home.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.396
His car is
in the driveway.

40:33.398 --> 40:35.231
Crap.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.267
It's none of your business.
Go away.

40:39.036 --> 40:41.171
Are you hearing impaired?

40:41.173 --> 40:44.274
Go away.

40:48.312 --> 40:49.512
Well...

40:50.748 --> 40:52.415
Well, what?

40:52.417 --> 40:54.751
My apology.

40:54.753 --> 40:56.386
I may be blonde.

40:56.388 --> 40:59.055
I may be a cheerleader,
but I'm no dumb bitch.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.424
And I'm definitely not
a cunt you want to fuck with.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.526
So open the door,

41:03.528 --> 41:07.030
get on your knees,
and beg for my forgiveness,

41:07.032 --> 41:08.698
if you know what's good
for you, sweety.

41:11.836 --> 41:13.336
I'm still here.

41:13.338 --> 41:15.939
Crap.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.074
I know, you're metaphorically
screwing Jordan

41:18.076 --> 41:19.909
while literally
screwing Dax.

41:22.079 --> 41:24.447
I told Dax, your shit-faced
video could have been

41:24.449 --> 41:27.851
so much more successful
if it was more dramatic

41:27.853 --> 41:30.186
instead of just
playing pathetic.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.554
The point is?

41:31.556 --> 41:34.057
You'll pay, sweetie.
I promise.

41:40.097 --> 41:43.366
Better be STD-free or
there'll be hell to pay.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.004
Jordan?

41:52.743 --> 41:54.110
Jordan!

41:59.383 --> 42:00.850
Jordan!

42:02.820 --> 42:05.755
Oh, crap. Crap.
Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap.

42:15.633 --> 42:16.900
Jordan.

42:23.507 --> 42:24.974
Jordan!

42:30.848 --> 42:31.915
Jordan.

42:36.521 --> 42:38.288
No. No. No.

42:41.926 --> 42:44.761
Oh, my God.

42:44.763 --> 42:45.929
Don't.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.536
Fuck!

43:01.512 --> 43:03.680
How can your aunt
be so mentally deficient?

43:03.682 --> 43:05.315
It's mental deficiency
to keep a gun loaded

43:05.317 --> 43:07.951
in the shop and not inform
anyone about the thing.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.786
It wasn't loaded?

43:09.788 --> 43:11.554
Then why are there
buckets of blood?

43:11.556 --> 43:14.390
Dax's blood that...

43:17.529 --> 43:18.895
Hello?

43:18.897 --> 43:20.463
Hello!

43:20.465 --> 43:24.567
Crap,
she hung up on me.

43:24.569 --> 43:25.702
Not my fault.

43:25.704 --> 43:26.970
Excuse me?

43:26.972 --> 43:28.471
Not my fault.

43:28.473 --> 43:30.073
Why is that on?

43:30.075 --> 43:31.975
Turn it off.

43:31.977 --> 43:34.410
Turn it off, idiot!

43:34.412 --> 43:35.545
Please.

43:44.855 --> 43:46.723
I'm sorry
for vociferating earlier.

43:46.725 --> 43:48.558
You understand?
Dax having brains...

43:48.560 --> 43:51.728
and seeing them splattered
all over Jordan's garage is

43:51.730 --> 43:54.731
quite jarring on both accounts.

43:54.733 --> 43:56.599
Excuse me?

43:56.601 --> 43:58.234
Yes, I am recording.

43:58.236 --> 43:59.702
So we have a record.

43:59.704 --> 44:01.604
An accurate record of
what actually occurred.

44:01.606 --> 44:05.742
Now was your aunt's gun loaded
when we took possession of it?

44:05.744 --> 44:06.743
<i>No.</i>

44:06.745 --> 44:08.244
Then how the hell?

44:11.582 --> 44:13.616
Are you 100% sure?

44:13.618 --> 44:15.251
<i>99%.</i>

44:15.253 --> 44:17.253
That 1% is
really important, Chunk.

44:17.255 --> 44:18.721
<i>Sorry, I didn't check it.</i>

44:18.723 --> 44:20.123
<i>I just assumed that</i>
<i>it would be--</i>

44:20.125 --> 44:22.392
Assumptions make asses
out of you and me.

44:22.394 --> 44:24.861
And right now we are grade
double A donkeys.

44:24.863 --> 44:27.030
<i>Why are you assuming</i>
<i>it was my fault, man?</i>

44:27.032 --> 44:28.765
You did supply the gun,
didn't you?

44:28.767 --> 44:31.034
<i>Well, you did say</i>
<i>so throw Dax's game in.</i>

44:31.036 --> 44:32.635
Don't you dare
turn on me, Chunk.

44:32.637 --> 44:34.404
<i>I'm not turning</i>
<i>on anyone, man.</i>

44:34.406 --> 44:35.905
<i>I just don't want</i>
<i>to be blamed.</i>

44:35.907 --> 44:37.707
<i>Like the camera</i>
<i>and the janitor,</i>

44:37.709 --> 44:39.776
<i>I told you guys like no,</i>
<i>but nobody listens to me.</i>

44:39.778 --> 44:42.278
<i>Like Chunk?</i>
<i>I told you guys I'm on diet.</i>

44:48.152 --> 44:50.119
Jordan.

44:50.121 --> 44:51.287
Jordan!

44:52.556 --> 44:53.489
What are you doing?

44:56.760 --> 44:57.894
Jordan!

45:06.070 --> 45:07.270
Jordan.

45:17.182 --> 45:18.815
Oh, my God.

45:21.018 --> 45:22.318
Oh, my God.

45:31.428 --> 45:34.297
Okay. Okay.

46:01.725 --> 46:03.459
PTSD.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.628
Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

46:05.630 --> 46:08.231
We maybe experiencing
some of that right now.

46:08.233 --> 46:09.365
Maybe more
so you than me but--

46:09.367 --> 46:11.000
Apple?

46:11.002 --> 46:15.004
But we need to overcome this
and think rationally.

46:15.006 --> 46:17.807
Like, for instance,

46:17.809 --> 46:19.008
maybe filming
all this isn't

46:19.010 --> 46:20.576
the smartest act
at this juncture.

46:20.578 --> 46:22.845
Then how do we--

46:22.847 --> 46:24.147
Continue.

46:24.149 --> 46:26.215
Finish the video?

46:26.217 --> 46:28.851
Finish the video?
Is that what you said?

46:28.853 --> 46:30.219
Asked.

46:30.221 --> 46:31.487
Dax is chopped up
in little pieces

46:31.489 --> 46:33.222
in garbage bags
in your garage.

46:33.224 --> 46:34.991
I think the last thing that
he's concerned about

46:34.993 --> 46:38.161
and we should be concerned
about is the video.

46:38.163 --> 46:39.762
Big pieces.

46:39.764 --> 46:42.265
Excuse me?

46:42.267 --> 46:44.867
Big guy. Big pieces.

46:48.005 --> 46:50.406
Perseverance.

46:50.408 --> 46:52.008
Finish what you start.

46:54.912 --> 46:56.779
Speaking of which,

46:56.781 --> 47:02.685
I spoke to Chunk last night
while you were busy with that.

47:02.687 --> 47:04.053
And she swears

47:04.055 --> 47:07.256
neither her nor her aunt
loaded the gun.

47:07.258 --> 47:10.126
It was loaded.

47:10.128 --> 47:13.129
It's true.
That's very true.

47:13.131 --> 47:14.430
Question is...

47:15.432 --> 47:16.899
how--how and--and--

47:16.901 --> 47:19.068
Who?
Who what?

47:19.070 --> 47:21.771
Who was at the door
last night?

47:21.773 --> 47:23.539
The first time.

47:23.541 --> 47:25.074
Uh, no one.

47:25.076 --> 47:27.944
No one.
No one rang the bell?

47:27.946 --> 47:30.813
It was
paranormal activity?
Eve.

47:30.815 --> 47:34.817
But I informed her
we--we were preoccupied

47:34.819 --> 47:36.452
with a little problem.

47:39.556 --> 47:43.726
Not a problem anymore.

47:43.728 --> 47:45.094
You have, uh...

47:52.169 --> 47:55.404
Look, made a boo-boo.

47:57.841 --> 47:59.842
School of hard knocks.

47:59.844 --> 48:01.611
Lesson number...

48:03.480 --> 48:05.348
Execution.

48:05.350 --> 48:09.185
Every prank must be executed
to the very end.

48:09.187 --> 48:10.486
The very end.

48:12.856 --> 48:14.090
Right, Connor?

48:30.507 --> 48:33.009
Fuck!

48:33.011 --> 48:34.143
Fuck.

49:04.141 --> 49:06.008
<i>I don't understand, man.</i>

49:06.010 --> 49:08.411
What don't you understand?
It's simple.

49:08.413 --> 49:11.547
We're in an irony of a paradox
of a conundrum.

49:11.549 --> 49:16.319
<i>Dang. That sucks, man?</i>

49:16.321 --> 49:20.756
The irony being the demise
of most despised individual

49:20.758 --> 49:25.261
in all our lives
brings us no joy.

49:25.263 --> 49:28.064
Only sorrow.

49:28.066 --> 49:30.700
Especially for me dragging
you guys into this mess.

49:36.707 --> 49:41.577
The paradox
for as popular as Dax was,

49:41.579 --> 49:43.212
there's been no police.

49:43.214 --> 49:44.780
No phone calls.

49:44.782 --> 49:47.083
No anything from anybody
for the past day and a half.

49:47.085 --> 49:50.586
It's not rational.

49:50.588 --> 49:52.855
The conundrum...

49:52.857 --> 49:55.591
to erase everything on this
camera that implicates us all

49:55.593 --> 49:57.960
or do we say that
to prove to the authority

49:57.962 --> 50:00.062
that this was all
an accident.

50:00.064 --> 50:04.200
<i>Who's got the camera now?</i>

50:04.202 --> 50:05.935
I do.

50:05.937 --> 50:08.304
Jordon requested
I keep filming.

50:08.306 --> 50:09.605
<i>For what?</i>

50:11.708 --> 50:13.576
To continue the prank.

50:13.578 --> 50:16.612
<i>Prank.</i>

50:16.614 --> 50:18.581
<i>What if all</i>
<i>this was no accident.</i>

50:18.583 --> 50:20.816
<i>What if all that stuff about</i>
<i>Dax and Eve made him</i>

50:20.818 --> 50:24.120
<i>all jealous and nuts, man.</i>

50:24.122 --> 50:25.755
<i>He's Irish.</i>

50:25.757 --> 50:28.124
<i>They're emotional, right?</i>

50:29.994 --> 50:31.127
What are you crying
about now?

50:31.129 --> 50:32.428
Get out.

50:32.430 --> 50:34.330
It smells like
body sweat in here. PS.

50:34.332 --> 50:36.265
What part of get out
do you not understand?

50:36.267 --> 50:37.800
Fine.

50:37.802 --> 50:39.402
There's an asshole waiting
for you outside.

50:39.404 --> 50:41.137
Who?
I don't know.

50:41.139 --> 50:43.472
Only one way to find out,
right, shit-face?

50:47.277 --> 50:48.544
<i>Connor?</i>

50:58.288 --> 50:59.555
Oh, crap.

51:01.691 --> 51:03.159
Yeah, motherfucker.

51:03.161 --> 51:04.360
You stay back
or I'll call the cops!

51:04.362 --> 51:05.694
Get your ass
out here now!

51:05.696 --> 51:06.929
Now!

51:06.931 --> 51:11.434
Okay,
but promise not to hurt me.

51:11.436 --> 51:12.535
Okay.

51:12.537 --> 51:15.004
Okay?

51:15.006 --> 51:18.174
Okay.

51:18.176 --> 51:19.508
I appreciate
your prudence.

51:19.510 --> 51:20.910
Give me
the fuckin' camera.

51:23.046 --> 51:24.780
Where the fuck
is the film?

51:24.782 --> 51:25.815
Where's the fuckin' tape?

51:25.817 --> 51:27.349
There is no tape.

51:27.351 --> 51:28.684
Don't bullshit me, son.

51:28.686 --> 51:31.454
No. It's a flashcard.
It's digital.

51:31.456 --> 51:32.888
It's called technology.

51:32.890 --> 51:34.156
It's off, right?

51:34.158 --> 51:37.393
Yes. Yes. Oh, my nose!

51:37.395 --> 51:40.696
Then don't bullshit me.
Where the fuck is Dax?

51:40.698 --> 51:42.198
In the garbage bag.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.566
I said no bullshit.
Where is he?

51:43.568 --> 51:44.834
He's at Jordan.

51:44.836 --> 51:46.502
Come on.

51:46.504 --> 51:47.803
You deleted that shit

51:47.805 --> 51:49.672
from a couple of
nights ago, right?

51:49.674 --> 51:51.407
Right?
Yes. Yes.

51:51.409 --> 51:53.175
And if somebody ask
what you see?

51:53.177 --> 51:56.846
Shit, that's what
you've seen, yeah?

51:56.848 --> 51:59.849
I'll fuck you all big
in the tight little A-hole.

51:59.851 --> 52:02.218
8 inches of black thunder,
you feel me.

52:02.220 --> 52:04.186
Yeah, you will.

52:09.359 --> 52:11.994
Oh, fuck.

52:11.996 --> 52:14.063
This shit is--

52:14.065 --> 52:17.867
how do you turn
this shit off?

52:17.869 --> 52:19.568
What the fuck
are you crying for?

52:19.570 --> 52:23.372
I didn't even
punk you yet.

52:23.374 --> 52:25.975
What the fuck did you do
to my boy?

52:33.517 --> 52:35.151
That's where
you fucks done him?

52:36.887 --> 52:38.454
Ow!

52:38.456 --> 52:39.855
Yeah, I think you're still
bull shitting me.

52:39.857 --> 52:41.457
I wish I were--.

52:41.459 --> 52:43.025
No, you're gonna prove
you're bull shitting me.

52:43.027 --> 52:44.026
Come on.

52:44.028 --> 52:45.161
I said come on.

52:47.030 --> 52:48.731
Pussy ass fuck.

52:48.733 --> 52:50.366
Save those tears for me

52:50.368 --> 52:53.135
and Dax and we both double
team your ass, sideways.

52:53.137 --> 52:56.639
Motherfucker trying
to bullshit, bull shitter.

52:56.641 --> 53:00.609
Just in case though, get
some video of this shit.

53:00.611 --> 53:03.412
Evidence for the police.

53:03.414 --> 53:05.881
Damn, never thought a black man
need to say something like that.

53:05.883 --> 53:07.416
How do you turn this
shit on?

53:10.287 --> 53:12.621
Ah, shit.

53:12.623 --> 53:14.990
Motherfucker.

53:14.992 --> 53:16.559
D, open up.

53:20.497 --> 53:21.797
D!

53:25.569 --> 53:27.536
Who the fuck home?

53:30.941 --> 53:32.308
By the way,
you seeing it yourself,

53:32.310 --> 53:33.609
ain't no breaking in.

53:33.611 --> 53:36.812
The door was open.
I'm just saying.

53:39.015 --> 53:40.783
What the fuck?

53:42.586 --> 53:45.187
What the fuck is that?

53:49.193 --> 53:50.593
What the fuck--

53:50.595 --> 53:51.594
D!

53:54.465 --> 53:55.831
Oh, shit.

53:55.833 --> 53:58.167
You almost killed me,
bitch.

54:02.306 --> 54:03.472
D!

54:09.980 --> 54:12.481
D!

54:42.345 --> 54:44.513
What a fool.

54:46.384 --> 54:48.117
Connor. Connor. Connor.

54:55.258 --> 54:57.526
Guess who's who?

55:01.765 --> 55:03.766
Oh, it doesn't matter.

55:03.768 --> 55:06.769
'Cause guess what time it is?

55:06.771 --> 55:08.904
It's Connor time.

55:08.906 --> 55:12.174
Yes, it is. Step on up.

55:14.778 --> 55:16.545
Go.

55:18.682 --> 55:20.749
Go!

55:20.751 --> 55:23.686
I'm sorry, Jordan. I didn't
factor in the consequences.

55:23.688 --> 55:26.889
Yeah, further.

55:26.891 --> 55:29.291
Further.

55:29.293 --> 55:31.794
Further. Further. Further.

55:31.796 --> 55:36.031
And perfect.
Stop right there.

55:36.033 --> 55:38.300
Can you guess
what I'm gonna do next?

55:38.302 --> 55:39.768
No.

55:39.770 --> 55:43.939
Prove you wrong.

55:43.941 --> 55:48.711
You said I was too stupid
and too weak,

55:48.713 --> 55:51.313
but, look, look,
here's your bully.

55:51.315 --> 55:53.315
All wrapped up.

55:53.317 --> 55:56.418
And here's the guy
who was gonna fuck up

55:56.420 --> 56:00.322
both of our futures
by ratting us out to the police.

56:00.324 --> 56:02.458
You believe that?

56:02.460 --> 56:03.959
I have proof.
You want to see?

56:03.961 --> 56:05.561
No.

56:05.563 --> 56:10.666
No one is going to fuck up
my future with Eve

56:10.668 --> 56:13.836
and more importantly
your future of 13

56:13.838 --> 56:16.472
<i>Star Trek</i>
<i>conventions in a row.</i>

56:16.474 --> 56:17.873
You know why?

56:20.844 --> 56:23.479
Pick it up.

56:23.481 --> 56:25.247
Pick it up!

56:35.258 --> 56:40.996
Now hug it
like a puppy.

56:40.998 --> 56:41.997
No.

56:41.999 --> 56:43.465
Connor!

56:46.870 --> 56:53.142
Because you own this
as much as I do.

56:53.144 --> 56:57.880
Don't you forget that
if the authorities see this

56:57.882 --> 57:05.287
and you pointing
and clicking this at old Dax

57:05.289 --> 57:09.024
then this isn't going
to look like an accident.

57:09.026 --> 57:12.995
It's going to look like someone
intentionally loaded the gun

57:12.997 --> 57:17.299
and shot Dax
dead on purpose.

57:17.301 --> 57:20.803
But don't you worry,
best friend,

57:20.805 --> 57:25.007
because over my dead body
will I let that happen to you.

57:40.056 --> 57:41.256
Is it recording?

57:41.258 --> 57:43.659
Uh, yeah.

57:43.661 --> 57:46.695
Whoever sees this,
he's a psycho.

57:46.697 --> 57:48.397
This was supposed to be
just an innocent prank

57:48.399 --> 57:49.665
and Jordan has gone psycho.

57:49.667 --> 57:50.933
What are you doing
with that?

57:50.935 --> 57:52.201
Okay.

57:55.572 --> 57:58.040
All right,
found a good shot.

58:04.914 --> 58:08.951
Bon voyage, Daxy.

58:08.953 --> 58:12.588
See you
on the other side not.

58:12.590 --> 58:16.058
Jordan, um, pray tell,

58:16.060 --> 58:20.562
what inspired you
to load the gun?

58:20.564 --> 58:22.197
I told you so.

58:24.467 --> 58:27.102
Excuse me?

58:27.104 --> 58:30.305
I told you so.
Come on, say it.

58:30.307 --> 58:32.207
Told you so?

58:32.209 --> 58:35.577
Yup. You're right.

58:35.579 --> 58:39.381
He was fucking her.
Not anymore though, right?

58:46.256 --> 58:51.026
Yew, gross.

59:05.775 --> 59:09.144
--on purpose.

59:09.146 --> 59:11.914
I called them already.
Why won't you believe me?

59:11.916 --> 59:15.017
Ahh.

59:20.423 --> 59:22.124
Trouble sleeping?

59:22.126 --> 59:24.927
Trouble waking up
in this nightmare.

59:33.937 --> 59:36.138
I think for me
it's not a wet dream.

59:43.947 --> 59:46.181
Hello.

59:46.183 --> 59:48.817
Who is this?

59:48.819 --> 59:53.021
Henrietta Chunk Torres,
is that you?

59:53.023 --> 59:56.291
Early bird
getting the worm.

59:56.293 --> 59:59.294
Okay, shut up.
Listen.

59:59.296 --> 01:00:03.832
I've got something
really awful to tell you.

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:07.336
You got punk'd.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:10.172
Yeah, yeah,
Connor got you good.

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:12.407
Yeah, well, you almost had
me believing Dax was dead.

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:13.709
And I'm--

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:14.977
Don't believe him,
he's lying.

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:20.849
Yeah, yeah,
he's a devious one indeed.

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:24.820
Well, listen I'm telling you
this because I'm your pal

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:27.322
and I don't want you
losing any more

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.358
sleep over this nonsense.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:33.996
Yeah, fuck him.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.366
All right.

01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:38.834
Good night, Chunk.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.506
I can't believe it either.

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.345
I do have it
in a Klingon.

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.515
Get some rest.

01:00:53.517 --> 01:00:55.017
You got a big day tomorrow.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.523
Sweet dreams, idiot.

01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:15.370
A touching tribute
to a pitcher and a catcher.

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:22.277
Someone used to understand
what a joke was.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.545
Who in their right mind

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:25.614
is gonna believe
he just disappeared?

01:01:25.616 --> 01:01:28.116
Lots of kids disappear
from the mall all the time.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.551
Five-year-olds.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.886
Dax and Omar
are grown men.

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:32.154
Were.

01:01:32.156 --> 01:01:33.789
And I don't think
I like your tone.

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:36.291
Sounds to me like
someone's hearing footsteps,

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.560
seeing ghosts,
hearing Dax

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:40.162
calling out to him
in the middle of the night.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:41.430
Does someone
have a guilty conscience?

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:42.798
Not me.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.499
Why would I?

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:46.668
So you're saying
the voices were real.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.704
I'm saying I didn't
do anything wrong.

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:57.079
You mean we didn't so
anything wrong, right?

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.681
Come on.

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:01.583
Gave you what you wanted.

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:04.286
Emotional
compensation, right?

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:05.821
So lighten up.

01:02:05.823 --> 01:02:07.189
Smile.

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:10.792
Put on a happy face.
We bested Dax Gaiman.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.229
Come on.

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:30.712
Hi, Eve.

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:32.714
Hey.

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:34.683
What are you doing here?

01:02:34.685 --> 01:02:37.119
Oh, sorry.

01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:38.553
What are we doing here?

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:40.489
Uh,
what's it look like?

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:42.057
Celebrating.

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:45.961
So you want nutty coconut
or rocky road?

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:56.338
What're you doing?

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.639
Showing the world

01:02:57.641 --> 01:02:59.474
what a beautiful
couple looks like.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:01.009
We're exclusive now.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:02.744
Goof.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:06.348
Stop.
You started it.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.883
No, you did.
Uh-uh, you did.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.384
I have proof.

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.221
Why is he here?

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.391
Connor is still here

01:03:16.393 --> 01:03:18.894
because he wants
to apologize for all the evil,

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:21.663
nasty things
he's ever said about you.

01:03:21.665 --> 01:03:25.033
But first,
he wants to tell us

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.669
how happy he is
to see us like this.

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:29.237
Okay.

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:32.674
Anytime.

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:36.044
Whatever you want,
just promise no more bags--

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:37.546
See?
He's doing it again.
No more bodies--

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:39.381
What?

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:40.849
Acting like he's
the smartest man in the room.

01:03:40.851 --> 01:03:42.551
Eve, as one
human being to another,

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:44.953
if you want to continue
being, leave now.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:46.521
That doesn't
sound like an apology.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.023
Apologies won't solve
what's been done.

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:49.691
Shut up
and say you're sorry, idiot.

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:51.226
Something really
wrong happened.
Connor--

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:52.427
The blood you
saw on my face--

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:53.628
Shut up!
Wasn't mine.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:54.629
What is he
talking about?

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.298
Jordan killed Dax
and Omar.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.566
Oh, my God,
stop fucking lying!

01:03:57.568 --> 01:03:59.201
You fucking stop.

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.437
Something humorous?

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:04.906
Come on.

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:06.208
You almost had me,

01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.043
but I saw Dax
and Omar earlier today.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:10.078
See?
You saw their cars.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.313
Their frickin' cars.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:12.547
Come on,
you got to see this game

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:14.216
I just got,
it's really cool.

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.218
I warned you.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.788
You're so good at that,
sounding so righteous.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:21.823
Yup.

01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:23.458
Drawers on the nightstand.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.460
<i>Don't keep me waiting.</i>

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:28.830
Give me the gun.

01:04:28.832 --> 01:04:30.732
What the hell are you--

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:33.068
Okay, you're gonna give her
the wrong impression, all right?

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:34.236
Where is it?

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.470
What? Stop.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:36.972
Stop toying with me.
The gun.

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:38.473
What gun?

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:39.474
Argh.

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:40.609
You needed to ask--

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:41.843
Don't fuck with me.

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:43.278
I'm not fucking
with anyone.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.447
I saw you kill him.
I saw you kill Omar.

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.115
Did you?

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.750
I saw the aftermath.

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:51.586
Are you sure that what
you saw is what you saw?

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:54.890
Maybe you should check.

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:01.763
You erased it?

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:05.967
You can't keep me quiet.

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:07.335
Go ahead,
call the cops.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.271
I did.

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:12.641
Somebody
warned them I would call.

01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:15.343
Said I was gonna
try and pull a prank.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:17.512
Paranoia.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:18.780
Delusions.

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:20.282
Hearing things,
seeing things.

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:22.384
Why--why don't you
just go home

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:25.020
and forget any of this
ever happened?

01:05:25.022 --> 01:05:27.489
You know, move on.

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:32.294
Live long
and prosper, Connor.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:43.171
No.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.147
I'm sane.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.382
I'm sane.

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.797
No.

01:06:09.665 --> 01:06:12.834
No, no, no, no.

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:13.969
I'm not going crazy.

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:17.339
I'm not going crazy.

01:06:22.345 --> 01:06:24.346
There were bags.

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:28.049
There were bodies.

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:32.587
There were bags.

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:39.928
Eve?

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:45.233
Eve?

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.712
Eve!

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.326
All your fault.
All your fault.

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:12.961
Jordan, no.

01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:14.262
Jordan, stop, please.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:15.630
What are you doing?

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:25.774
Oh, God.

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.414
Oh, my God. Oh.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.751
All your fault.

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:56.671
Praise be to the God
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:58.173
His great mercy...

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:25.100
All your fault.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.037
All your fault, Connor.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:44.853
Please, please, please.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.821
I'm sorry.
Please.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.723
<i>Are you now?</i>
<i>Really?</i>

01:08:53.828 --> 01:08:56.731
Lesson number one
at the school of hard knocks,

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:59.734
don't bullshit
no bull shitters.

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:01.935
What'd you call it?
Deception?

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:04.506
Motherfucker, you really
thought we were homos?

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:07.341
Thinking after all
these fucking years.

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:08.710
Go ahead,
mother fucker, huh?

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:10.011
Go ahead, huh?

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:11.379
What's the matter,
you bitch?

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:12.779
You can't fuckin'
sucker punch

01:09:12.782 --> 01:09:14.616
somebody when
they're tied to a chair?

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:17.218
Nine years of your
fucking bullshit and look.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.020
Look at me, motherfucker,
look at me!

01:09:20.023 --> 01:09:21.356
I'm still here!

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:23.124
You know
why we won't bitch?

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:25.026
'Cause I'm a fucking
white knight.

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.861
And you're
the fucking evil.

01:09:26.863 --> 01:09:29.130
It's a night where
evil's been destroyed,

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:31.032
you little pussy.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.469
Lesson number two.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.104
Theatricals.

01:09:36.106 --> 01:09:39.040
You see, dead cow parts
ain't dead people parts.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:42.109
And blanks ain't real bullets,
you dumb fuck.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:47.916
The most important lesson,
don't you forget,

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.551
you mess with Eve
and she's gonna plant

01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:51.286
some mayhem on your ass.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.487
Damn straight.

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:53.888
Guys, come on.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.123
I'm getting way
too much credit here.

01:09:55.125 --> 01:09:56.257
This is a no-brainer.

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:58.159
A win-win for everybody.

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:00.428
We finally stop
shit-face's sexist,

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:03.665
homophobic,
psychotic crusade against us

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.433
and the audience
gets to see one of the coolest,

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:08.069
most epic pranks
ever put on the internet,

01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:10.305
and we all get to reap
the ad money.

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:12.006
Told you you'd pay,
sweetie.

01:10:12.008 --> 01:10:13.341
And, oh, yeah, bonus.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.143
Shit-face finally
learned his lesson

01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:18.179
from the only person who could
turn his own prank against him.

01:10:18.181 --> 01:10:19.647
Oh, crap, crap,

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.584
I'm such a pussy,
I'm gonna cry.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:26.654
You were fucking right,
homeboy.

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:27.855
What you laughing for?

01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:29.324
You the ass in this joke.

01:10:29.326 --> 01:10:30.425
Oh, he's just getting
a head start

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:31.926
after everybody else sees

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:34.095
the further adventures
of fucking shit face.

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.330
Or he finally learned,

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.098
what do they say
in <i>Star Wars?</i>

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.700
Resistance is futile?

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:40.301
Don't forget it, sweetie.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:41.603
All right.

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.204
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:44.672
Who's up for some Chili's?
It's on me.

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:45.840
Am I hearing things?

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:47.175
Did they treat you?

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:48.476
Make yourself
presentable, girl.

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:49.844
That's some
supernatural shit.

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:51.179
- Hey, chill, man.
- Wait, hey, wait.

01:10:51.181 --> 01:10:52.513
Just before that you said
that we would

01:10:52.515 --> 01:10:53.948
clean up together,
I mean, you can like,

01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:55.817
totally upload
the video here.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:57.619
I wish we could but I need
to go home and change.

01:10:57.621 --> 01:10:59.721
I'm like all icky.

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:00.989
Thanks though.
You're a cool friend.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:02.190
No, you're not
leaving here.

01:11:02.192 --> 01:11:03.524
Come on, man.
Prank is over.

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:04.826
Shut the fuck out.
Fuck you. She's--

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.829
Jordan,
what's your problem, huh?

01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:11.566
How do you turn this
fucking thing off?

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:14.002
Don't look at me.

01:11:37.993 --> 01:11:39.327
Hey, did you get those

01:11:39.329 --> 01:11:40.528
tickets I left you
in the locker?

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.030
Gesture's appreciated,

01:11:42.032 --> 01:11:43.665
'course I won't be
able to attend.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.266
Well, what about breaking
John Meringer's record?

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:47.068
Hey, slow down, will you?

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.169
Can't, I have a plethora of

01:11:48.171 --> 01:11:49.370
college applications
to complete.

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:50.772
AP exams to study for.

01:11:50.774 --> 01:11:52.674
All right,
but I'm sorry.

01:11:52.676 --> 01:11:54.042
You hear me?

01:11:54.044 --> 01:11:55.910
I'm sorry, Connor.

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:03.017
You're completely right.

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:04.385
I was a rube.

01:12:04.387 --> 01:12:05.920
Couldn't see
right from wrong,

01:12:05.922 --> 01:12:08.589
friends from enemies,
now I can.

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:09.791
Thank you.

01:12:09.793 --> 01:12:11.192
I'm still your friend.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.194
Do you want me
to prove it to you?

01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:16.030
Prove you have some decency
and leave me the fuck alone.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.268
Execution.

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.271
Every prank must be
executed to the very end.

01:12:23.273 --> 01:12:24.806
The very end.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:26.574
Right, Connor?

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.955
Guys, you made it.

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:42.557
So good of you to come.

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:45.860
Chunk, great to see you.

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:49.731
What're you doing?

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:50.932
Come on in.

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.742
You guys want anything?

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:02.610
My dad's on quote unquote
business again,

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:05.079
so beers all around.

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:06.981
It's been 2 months, Jordan.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:09.250
I know.
I know, way too long.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:10.818
Since the prank.

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.086
Yeah, man.

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:14.756
Why are you
still wearing that?

01:13:14.758 --> 01:13:18.826
Okay, this is
kind of embarrassing.

01:13:18.828 --> 01:13:20.628
I had to wait until
my dad was out of town

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:23.498
and I needed
time to reconfigure,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.133
you know...

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:31.005
God, guys, has it
really been that long?

01:13:31.007 --> 01:13:32.340
Let me show you.

01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:34.275
Here you go,
talented camera-woman

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:37.211
and the smartest guy
in the room, huh?

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:38.613
Let's go.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.785
Okay.

01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:45.787
Don't laugh, all right?

01:13:45.789 --> 01:13:47.021
Chunk.

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:53.661
Dang.

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:58.633
I know, I know.
I messed up.

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:00.001
Here.
Watch.

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:06.808
See?

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.676
I'm not an idea guy.

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:10.545
I'm not a genius
like you, Connor.

01:14:10.547 --> 01:14:13.414
I told you
he was emotional.

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:14.916
This is another prank.

01:14:14.918 --> 01:14:16.150
I know.

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:18.553
Us, right?

01:14:18.555 --> 01:14:20.054
Or them?

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.155
Neither.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:22.423
Well, what is this?

01:14:22.425 --> 01:14:25.660
This is rape, rape, rape!

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.729
Remember Barnes?

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.400
These two are
mutually exclusive now.

01:14:32.402 --> 01:14:34.202
Did you know that?

01:14:34.204 --> 01:14:37.672
That's why they're here,
to celebrate.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:38.906
And here they are after

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:42.276
I offered them
both a huge gift.

01:14:42.278 --> 01:14:44.412
Not like she kept
the last one.

01:14:44.414 --> 01:14:46.047
Not like
she didn't pawn it off

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:48.216
at Chunk's aunt's
pawn shop or anything.

01:14:48.218 --> 01:14:49.717
Right, sweetie? Huh?

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:50.952
You told him?

01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.186
Not me, man.

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:53.688
I knew it was bad news.

01:14:53.690 --> 01:14:55.456
Not this bad.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:57.558
Do you have
something then?

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.961
'Cause they're the gift.

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:01.496
For you, Connor.

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.599
Emotional compensation,
right?

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:07.969
We're done with
this childish buffoonery.

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:08.970
Let's go.

01:15:10.306 --> 01:15:11.806
No, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:15:11.808 --> 01:15:12.874
One.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.109
Dang.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.717
Oh, my God.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:25.753
Chunk, frame it up.

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:29.891
Frame it up.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.393
Chunk.

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.129
Connor?

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:48.276
Banish the evil
from among them.

01:15:48.278 --> 01:15:50.611
The rest of the people
will hear about this

01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:53.781
and be afraid
and never again--

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.616
Oh!

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.797
Connor, don't!

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:15.570
This is not what
you wanted, right?

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:19.440
This isn't our fault, right?

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.277
We're innocent, right?

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:25.680
Right?

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.962
Focused?

01:16:45.968 --> 01:16:47.635
This is not a confession.

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:53.207
This isn't,
he said she's dead.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.976
This is the truth.

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.980
We're not murderers.

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.686
We're not monsters.
