WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.071
ANGLEMAN:
 The project-- it escaped.

00:03.104 --> 00:05.038
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:05.073 --> 00:06.674
BUFFY:
 The Initiative created
 this thing, and they can't

00:06.705 --> 00:08.509
stop it, but we will.

00:08.541 --> 00:10.611
It's Faith. She's awake.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.083
We all right?
Five by five.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.484
WILKINS:
 Open the box. Surprise!

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
(whooshing)
(groans)

00:19.586 --> 00:21.621
You sure you're okay?
Five by five.

00:23.623 --> 00:27.995
(garbled radio transmission,
quiet chatter)

00:28.027 --> 00:31.431
It's good you called. We've
been looking for this girl since

00:31.464 --> 00:33.033
she broke out of the hospital.

00:33.067 --> 00:34.368
What's gonna
happen to her?
Well,

00:34.402 --> 00:36.503
get her checked out.
She's in stable condition,

00:36.536 --> 00:38.271
she goes to jail, pending trial.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.941
I just hope
she gets some kind of help.

00:40.973 --> 00:43.543
Well, first thing is to keep
her from hurting anybody else.

00:43.576 --> 00:46.045
(soft groaning)

00:50.783 --> 00:53.420
(soft groaning)

00:53.454 --> 00:55.588
One, two.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.890
MAN:
Yeah. Lift her.
Well, you guys will be

00:57.924 --> 01:00.460
safe now. We may have a couple
of questions in the morning.

01:00.493 --> 01:04.596
Oh, uh, of course.
Thank you both. I'm glad
we finally got the kid.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.200
She's not a kid.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.204
I just mean
that she's very strong.
Yeah.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.274
This Faith chick--
definitely dangerous.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.742
(ambulance engine starts,
horn toots)

01:22.283 --> 01:24.817
She truly is.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.992
(wolf howling)

01:32.025 --> 01:34.194
*

02:27.181 --> 02:30.283
Faith...

02:30.318 --> 02:32.985
Why do you think
she's like that?

02:35.656 --> 02:39.393
You know, she's a nut job.

02:39.426 --> 02:42.128
I just don't understand
what could drive a person

02:42.162 --> 02:43.963
to that kind of behavior.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.500
Well, how do you know
she got drove?

02:46.533 --> 02:49.168
I mean, maybe
she likes being that way.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.239
I'll never believe that.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.507
I think she's horribly unhappy.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.909
Well, could be
things are looking up.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.912
I mean, a little stint
in the pokey,

02:58.945 --> 03:01.314
show her the error of her ways.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.082
I'm sure
there's some big old Bertha

03:03.116 --> 03:06.419
just waiting to shower her ripe
little self with affection.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.621
Buffy!

03:10.090 --> 03:12.158
I'm sorry, Mom.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.328
It's just...

03:14.361 --> 03:18.865
when I think about how she might
have hurt you, I just...

03:18.899 --> 03:21.168
I can't stand it.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.304
Oh. (laughs softly)

03:26.205 --> 03:28.542
Sorry.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.878
No, I'm just...
sore from the fight.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.682
I've missed you.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.084
'Cause I haven't visited,
right? I knew it.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.519
I know how it is.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.054
You've got so much
in your life now.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.022
I'm a busy little beaver.

03:43.055 --> 03:44.391
College and all.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.360
Of course.

03:46.394 --> 03:50.930
But, um, maybe we could spend
some time together soon?

03:50.963 --> 03:53.300
Some night when
I'm not being

03:53.334 --> 03:56.235
held hostage
by a raving psychotic.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.173
Count on it.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.211
I'm gonna take a bath.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.281
(water dripping)

04:07.314 --> 04:08.782
(sigh)

04:40.279 --> 04:41.682
Why, yes,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.283
I would be Buffy.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.418
May I help you?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.220
Buffy.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.192
You can't do that.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.793
It's wrong.

04:53.826 --> 04:58.699
You can't do that
because it's naughty.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.934
Because it's wrong.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.704
(softly):
Because it's wrong.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.706
You can't do that.
It's wrong.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.141
I'll kick your ass.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.442
I'm gonna kill you.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.411
(laughing)

05:12.846 --> 05:14.213
Let go! Let me go!

05:14.247 --> 05:15.983
Get me a sedative now!

05:16.016 --> 05:18.386
Hold her!
I have to go home!
She's with my mother!

05:18.418 --> 05:20.319
No!
Just lie still.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.490
You don't understand.
Keep holding her.

05:23.524 --> 05:26.259
She's taken my... my body.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.898
I wonder where she is.

05:30.930 --> 05:34.401
Who? Faith?
Yeah.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.670
I wish she would make a move.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.240
She's making my
stomach all acidy.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.576
But you think
Buffy can handle her.

05:44.043 --> 05:47.314
I think so.

05:47.346 --> 05:52.319
But that doesn't mean
Faith won't hurt someone else.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.221
Well, you should be safe.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.988
Nobody knows you're here.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.593
I mean, they don't even know
I exist, right?

05:59.627 --> 06:02.161
I know all
about them, but...

06:02.194 --> 06:05.565
Hey.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.334
I mean, I mean,
that's-that's totally cool.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.369
I mean, it's-it's good.
It's... it's better.

06:09.403 --> 06:13.206
Tara, it's not like I don't
want my friends to know you.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.708
It's just...

06:15.975 --> 06:17.911
Well, Buffy's like
my best friend,

06:17.944 --> 06:20.279
and she's really special.

06:20.312 --> 06:23.550
And there's this
whole bunch of us,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.952
and-and we sort of have
this group thing

06:25.985 --> 06:28.088
that revolves
around the slaying,

06:28.120 --> 06:31.459
and... and I really want you
to meet them.

06:31.492 --> 06:34.026
But I-I just...

06:34.060 --> 06:40.668
kind of like having something
that's just, you know, mine.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.206
And I-I usually
don't use so many words

06:46.238 --> 06:51.244
to say stuff that little,
but... do you get it at all?

06:52.446 --> 06:54.747
I do.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.524
I should check in with Giles,
get a situation update.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.494
I am, you know.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.463
What?

07:10.697 --> 07:13.165
Yours.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.949
Not too bad.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.793
Score.

07:42.129 --> 07:46.466
Six-four-four-seven.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.502
Uh, expiration, five-oh-one.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.372
Uh-huh. Yeah.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.209
10:00 a.m.'s
your earliest flight?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.146
I'll take it.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.848
(phone beeps off)

08:01.882 --> 08:03.483
What are you doing?

08:04.884 --> 08:07.153
Oh, just getting my mail.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.658
Oh. Um, that was, um,
Giles on the other line.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.726
He wanted you to meet your
friends there. Said he had news.

08:16.228 --> 08:19.331
Yeah. I got some time to kill.

08:19.365 --> 08:22.168
I'll go see the gang.

08:22.201 --> 08:25.072
All my friends. You don't mind
if I steal this, right?

08:25.105 --> 08:28.507
Is that the Harlot?
Yeah.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.110
That's the same one
Faith picked.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.080
Burn it.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.885
(garbled radio transmission)

08:38.918 --> 08:41.922
(moans softly)

08:41.955 --> 08:43.756
(tires squeak)

08:43.789 --> 08:45.192
She's coming to.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.760
Man, I want this kid's
constitution.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.397
Faith.

08:50.429 --> 08:53.866
Let's move it. I want
to get her in before she's 100%.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.135
(tires squealing, thudding)

09:00.539 --> 09:02.942
(gun chamber clicks)

09:09.783 --> 09:12.519
(soft groaning)
By order of the Watchers
Council, you are being

09:12.552 --> 09:14.053
taken into custody
until such time...

09:14.086 --> 09:15.554
Oh, skip the speech.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.493
(soft groaning)

09:23.562 --> 09:25.565
Let's go.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.606
(crickets chirping)

09:33.640 --> 09:36.442
Ah, Buffy.
Good.

09:36.475 --> 09:40.880
The Scooby Gang's
all here-- Willow,

09:40.913 --> 09:44.283
Xander and... everybody.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.653
What's up?
GILES:
It's about Faith,

09:46.687 --> 09:48.889
not surprisingly.
Didn't Joyce tell you?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.389
I already kicked
that ass.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.558
I feel a high-five
coming on.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.326
Where is she?
On her way to the

09:54.360 --> 09:57.297
big house. Cops took her off
my hands about an hour ago.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.066
Poetic justice.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.634
How's that?

10:00.668 --> 10:03.836
Well, she did all those crimes,

10:03.870 --> 10:05.639
and now she's being arrested.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.809
I guess
that's just regular justice.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.845
It's cool, anyway.
Unless I'm mistaken,

10:11.879 --> 10:14.881
Faith is no longer
in police custody.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.918
What are you talking about?

10:18.951 --> 10:20.519
The Watchers Council.

10:20.552 --> 10:22.822
They, uh, sent
a retrieval team to

10:22.855 --> 10:24.323
capture Faith.

10:24.356 --> 10:26.259
Well, yeah, I mean,

10:26.293 --> 10:28.828
'cause it worked so well
when Wesley tried it.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.097
This is a-a special
operations unit.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.499
They, uh,

10:32.532 --> 10:35.034
handle the Council's
trickier jobs--

10:35.067 --> 10:37.671
smuggling,
interrogation,
uh, wet works.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.371
What's
wet works?

10:39.405 --> 10:42.609
Scuba-type stuff.
I thought
it was murder.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.812
Well, yeah, but there
could be underwater murder,

10:44.845 --> 10:47.780
with snorkels.
BUFFY:
So, they're

10:47.815 --> 10:50.216
taking her to England?
GILES:
It'll be a long, long

10:50.250 --> 10:52.318
time before she returns.

10:52.351 --> 10:53.886
(laughs)

10:53.921 --> 10:56.523
Ah. (laughing)

10:56.556 --> 10:59.225
Oh. I'm-I'm sorry. It...

10:59.259 --> 11:02.863
(muffled laugh)
It's just... I'm happy.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.865
Faith is evil.

11:04.898 --> 11:07.567
Yeah. I hope they
throw the book at her.
GILES: I'm not sure

11:07.600 --> 11:09.903
there is a-a
book for this.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.304
They could throw other things.
I forgot

11:12.339 --> 11:14.240
how much you don't like Faith.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.076
After what
she's done to you?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.811
Ooh, I wish
those Council guys

11:17.845 --> 11:21.081
would let me have an hour
alone in the room with her,

11:21.114 --> 11:24.051
if I was larger
and had grenades.

11:24.083 --> 11:27.821
I bet I know
what Faith would say to that.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.091
(groaning)

11:31.124 --> 11:33.159
ANYA:
So what you're saying
is that everything's fine?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.761
GILES:
Um, yes.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.196
ANYA:
Well, I'm glad you
called us all here

11:36.229 --> 11:37.496
because that
information
could never

11:37.529 --> 11:38.865
be conveyed
by telephone.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.100
What's up?
GILES:
I just thought it was

11:41.134 --> 11:42.701
best to convene, in case
there were any loose ends

11:42.735 --> 11:44.772
I'd never let her hurt you.
or things

11:44.804 --> 11:46.239
that we might have forgotten.
I know.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.941
GILES:
But if you're keen
to go, then, uh,

11:47.975 --> 11:50.610
please, by
all means, go.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.179
We kind of have
a romantic evening planned.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.749
We were gonna light a bunch of
candles and have sex near them.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.350
BUFFY:
Well,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.686
we certainly don't want
to cut into that seven minutes.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.923
Hey.
I believe that's
my "hey." Hey.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.057
Lighten up.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.360
We're out of danger.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.861
Everything's good.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.130
GILES:
We still have Adam
to take care of.

12:11.163 --> 12:14.768
Yeah. Adam.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.735
What's up with him?

12:16.769 --> 12:18.938
I wish we knew.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.472
Well, don't worry about it.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.143
I'll patrol tonight,
as long as it takes.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.245
You guys have your fun.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.115
I'll be out there doing my job.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.650
(loud rock and roll playing,
crowd chatter)

12:34.988 --> 12:40.126
* Electronic drums
and synthesizers *

12:40.159 --> 12:44.764
* Angular haircuts
and black eyeliner *

12:44.798 --> 12:46.432
* We'll start
a new wave band *

12:46.466 --> 12:47.801
Ooh.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.501
* And then
I'll make you mine *

12:49.536 --> 12:52.072
Oh, you.
* You'll play the keyboards...

12:52.105 --> 12:53.505
And... you.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.341
What, are you keeping tabs
on me?

12:55.375 --> 12:56.943
You're gonna give me
a hard time now?

12:56.976 --> 12:58.812
* We'll show the jocks...

12:58.846 --> 13:02.014
Uh, do I usually
give you a hard time?

13:02.048 --> 13:03.850
Very funny.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.686
Well, you don't have
to worry about me drinking,

13:06.719 --> 13:10.157
unless you're here
to protect innocent beers.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.625
* Yeah, you've gone away
to med school *

13:12.658 --> 13:14.461
* And I've gone
out of my mind... *

13:14.494 --> 13:16.462
You're a vampire.

13:16.495 --> 13:20.600
Was. And as soon as I get
this chip out of my head,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.469
I'll be a vampire again.

13:22.501 --> 13:25.972
But until then, I'm just as
helpless as a kitten up a tree,

13:26.005 --> 13:27.706
so why don't you sod off?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.876
Okay.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.511
Oh, fine! Throw it in my face!

13:32.544 --> 13:35.115
"Spike's not a threat anymore.
I'll turn my back.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.716
He can't hurt me."

13:36.749 --> 13:38.684
Spike.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.287
* Put your glasses on...

13:40.320 --> 13:42.121
Spike.

13:42.154 --> 13:45.658
William the Bloody
with a chip in his head.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.294
I kind of love
this town.
(scoffs)

13:48.327 --> 13:51.730
You know why I really
hate you, Summers?

13:51.764 --> 13:55.067
'Cause I'm a stuck-up tight-ass
with no sense of fun?

13:55.101 --> 13:59.538
Well... yeah,
that covers a lot of it.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.140
'Cause I could do
anything I want,

14:01.173 --> 14:02.909
and instead, I choose
to pout and whine

14:02.942 --> 14:04.844
and feel the burden
of slayerness?

14:04.878 --> 14:08.315
I mean, I could be
rich, I could be famous,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.450
I could have anything.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.086
Anyone.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.326
Even you, Spike.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.561
I could ride you at a gallop

14:21.594 --> 14:24.264
until your legs buckled
and your eyes rolled up.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.599
I've got muscles
you've never even

14:26.633 --> 14:29.269
dreamed of. I could
squeeze you until you

14:29.302 --> 14:31.738
popped like warm champagne,
and you'd beg me

14:31.770 --> 14:33.605
to hurt you just
a little bit more.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.143
And you know why I don't?

14:41.413 --> 14:44.250
Because it's wrong.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.919
(laughs)

14:50.157 --> 14:52.392
I get this chip out,

14:52.424 --> 14:55.294
you and me are gonna have
a confrontation.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.763
Count on it.

14:56.796 --> 15:01.100
* Yeah, I've been
watching me fall *

15:01.134 --> 15:03.702
(grunts)
* For it seems like years

15:03.735 --> 15:05.772
* Years, years...
(grunting)

15:05.804 --> 15:07.975
Oh. Ow.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.408
It was too crowded.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.943
We got to hold out
for a few hours,

15:10.977 --> 15:13.379
pick up a straggler,
some drunk.

15:13.413 --> 15:18.118
Can't be calling attention
to... ourselves.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.153
I've been thinking...

15:21.520 --> 15:23.889
...about vampires.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.493
This is my place.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.596
Your place.
Yes. The sewers.

15:29.629 --> 15:34.500
You hide from them,
crawl about in their filth,

15:34.533 --> 15:36.936
scavenging like rats.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.739
What do you fear?

15:39.772 --> 15:42.274
Kill this guy already.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.476
(growling)

15:44.510 --> 15:47.913
(groans, bones crunching)
You fear the cross,

15:47.947 --> 15:51.750
the sun, fire.
(guttural gasping)

15:51.783 --> 15:54.086
And, oh, yes...

15:54.120 --> 15:56.523
(squishing and tearing)

15:56.556 --> 15:58.158
(whooshing)

15:58.191 --> 16:01.860
I believe decapitation
is a problem, as well.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.330
You can have the place.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.931
I mean, we-we don't have
to stay here anymore.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.534
You fear death. Being immortal,

16:08.567 --> 16:12.304
you fear it more than those
to whom it comes naturally.

16:12.339 --> 16:17.376
Vampires are a paradox.
Okay.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.179
We're a paradox. That's cool.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.448
Demon in a human body.

16:22.481 --> 16:26.019
You walk in both worlds
and belong to neither.

16:27.586 --> 16:29.956
I can relate.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.957
Come.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.360
We have a lot to talk about.

16:38.365 --> 16:41.734
(chains jingling)

16:41.768 --> 16:44.003
MAN:
Well, it's awake.

16:45.404 --> 16:47.506
Who are you?

16:47.539 --> 16:50.842
Council. We're taking you back
to the mother country.

16:50.876 --> 16:54.213
Seems you've been
a naughty girl.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.349
Listen to me.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.384
You've made a mistake.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.820
I am not Faith.

17:00.852 --> 17:03.690
I'm Buffy Summers.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.491
Faith performed
some kind of spell.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.992
She switched our bodies.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.729
Congratulations.
No one's ever actually

17:09.761 --> 17:11.230
tried that one on me before.

17:11.262 --> 17:13.031
You have to find Faith.

17:13.066 --> 17:17.002
Call Giles. Just get him here.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.405
Giles doesn't work
for the Council anymore.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.842
For that matter,
neither does Buffy Summers.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.544
And what you are, Miss,
is the package.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.944
I deliver the package.

17:26.979 --> 17:30.016
I don't much care
what's inside.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.419
Come on.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.455
He may not care, but I do.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.759
The Watchers Council
used to mean something.

17:39.791 --> 17:41.927
You perverted it.

17:41.961 --> 17:46.098
You trash, we should have killed
you while you were asleep.

18:01.147 --> 18:03.115
I can't believe
you've never been here.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.984
The Bronze is the coolest place
in Sunnydale.

18:06.018 --> 18:09.055
Of course, there's not
a lot of competition.

18:09.087 --> 18:12.291
I think the vending machine
at Burgin's came in second.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.161
You used to
come here a lot?

18:14.193 --> 18:15.595
I lived here.

18:15.627 --> 18:18.265
Me, Xander...
MAN:
Chug, chug, chug.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.133
Buffy.
BUFFY:
Chug, chug, chug, chug.

18:20.166 --> 18:23.670
Chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug... Ooh!

18:23.702 --> 18:27.874
Wow. I-I didn't think
she'd be here.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.310
Come on, I want you
to meet her.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.912
BUFFY:
Back off.

18:32.944 --> 18:34.547
You're nothing
but a disappointment.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.151
Hey, Buffy.
Willow

18:38.184 --> 18:40.686
and... uh...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.689
Buffy, this is Tara.
Hi.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.990
So we've never met.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.929
Cool. Just having
a thing with names.

18:49.961 --> 18:52.030
Tara was in my Wicca group.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.032
Uh-huh.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.669
So, what's up?

18:56.702 --> 18:59.205
Patrol a no-go?
(sighs)

18:59.239 --> 19:02.040
Got tired. You know,
the whole Faith thing.

19:02.074 --> 19:03.375
I let off some steam.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.844
Good for you.

19:04.876 --> 19:07.213
You shouldn't work
yourself too hard.

19:07.247 --> 19:10.182
That's my philosophy.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.984
Anyone want a soda?

19:13.019 --> 19:14.653
Water.

19:27.165 --> 19:30.970
So you guys been hanging
out a lot lately, huh?

19:31.002 --> 19:34.441
Yeah. She's, um...
she's really cool.

19:37.443 --> 19:40.046
So Willow's not driving stick
anymore.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.647
Who would
have thought?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.549
I guess you never
really know someone

19:43.583 --> 19:45.718
until you've been
inside their skin.

19:45.751 --> 19:48.688
And Oz is out
of the picture?

19:48.721 --> 19:53.393
Oh, never seen two people
so much in love.

19:53.425 --> 19:54.993
She just couldn't get enough

19:55.027 --> 19:56.663
of old Oz.

19:56.695 --> 20:01.233
She, um, said he,
uh, uh, w-w-w-w-- we...

20:01.268 --> 20:03.035
He w-w-w-w-what?

20:03.068 --> 20:05.404
You gonna get that sentence out
sometime tonight?

20:07.906 --> 20:10.777
Buffy, guy in the corner.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.681
Yeah.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.249
Good call.
What?

20:16.282 --> 20:18.084
Vampire.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.788
He's wicked obvious.

20:24.723 --> 20:29.127
So I should slay him.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.529
You want help?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.265
Nah, I got it.

20:32.298 --> 20:37.002
* Start a new life...

20:39.838 --> 20:45.511
(growling, whimpering)

20:46.512 --> 20:48.714
Hey!

20:48.748 --> 20:51.750
(grunting)

20:51.784 --> 20:54.252
(growling, groaning)

20:54.287 --> 20:57.155
(thudding)

20:57.189 --> 20:59.191
(sighs)

21:00.527 --> 21:02.394
You'll live.
Uh...

21:02.429 --> 21:05.298
He was so strong.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.799
Yeah, well, he's gone now.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.673
Thank you.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.476
Thank you.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.246
Yeah.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.682
It's cool.

21:25.151 --> 21:28.755
* It's a time and place,
ooh, ooh *

21:28.788 --> 21:30.323
* Sweet Charlotte Rose...

21:30.356 --> 21:31.790
Everything poofed?

21:31.824 --> 21:35.193
All's well in the world.

21:35.227 --> 21:39.699
Tara's not feeling well.
I'm gonna walk her home.

21:39.731 --> 21:43.603
Yeah. You give her
whatever she needs.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.305
Are you gonna be in later,
or you going over to Riley's?

21:51.042 --> 21:54.381
(loud banging)

21:59.685 --> 22:01.887
This'll bloody keep you quiet.

22:05.557 --> 22:08.528
(groaning)

22:08.560 --> 22:10.229
(grunts)
How about this?

22:10.261 --> 22:12.131
I'll be quiet,
and you can scream.

22:12.163 --> 22:13.365
(yells)

22:13.400 --> 22:15.034
(panting)

22:15.067 --> 22:19.337
Now you unchain me...
very slowly and politely,

22:19.372 --> 22:21.374
or I kill this guy.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.375
When we go on a job,

22:23.410 --> 22:25.845
we always put our affairs
in order first,

22:25.877 --> 22:28.381
in case of accident.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.718
(gasps)
Collins...

22:31.750 --> 22:34.554
Sorry, Smithy.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.089
She's starting
to bother me.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.558
Getting her
across the border

22:39.592 --> 22:41.227
is gonna be a lot more
trouble than it's worth.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.194
If the Council could
even get us passage.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.064
I'll call them.

22:45.096 --> 22:47.232
It's time
for a contingency plan.
(Faith grunts, blow landing)

22:47.266 --> 22:49.367
(Smith groans)

22:54.140 --> 22:55.974
(door opens)

23:03.214 --> 23:05.417
Hi, baby.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.529
I'm sorry you're
feeling all blechy.

23:17.564 --> 23:21.099
But we'll get together
with Buffy another time.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.269
Sometime soon. I think
you'll really like her.

23:24.303 --> 23:28.240
(sighs)
She's not your friend.

23:28.273 --> 23:31.877
I may have overestimated
the "you liking her" factor.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.246
No, no. I mean, I don't...
(sighs)

23:34.279 --> 23:38.384
I-I don't think she's... her.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.287
You lost me.

23:41.319 --> 23:45.758
Well, a person's energy
has a flow, a unity.

23:45.791 --> 23:49.561
Buffy's was... was fragmented.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.566
It grated, like something forced
in where it doesn't belong.

23:53.599 --> 23:58.304
Plus, she was, um...
she was kind of mean.

23:58.336 --> 24:01.440
So you think Buffy's not
herself?

24:01.473 --> 24:04.276
Like she's been possessed
or something?

24:04.309 --> 24:06.613
I'm not sure.
You didn't

24:06.645 --> 24:08.413
sense a hyena energy
at all, did you?

24:08.446 --> 24:12.218
Because hyena possession
is just... unpleasant.

24:13.384 --> 24:15.922
Do you have anything of hers?

24:15.954 --> 24:20.859
Of Buffy's? Uh...
Oh, this ring.

24:20.893 --> 24:25.396
I-I think there's a way
we can... Hmm.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.301
The passage
to the nether realm.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.838
There-there's a ritual.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.842
If you can find Buffy there,
you should be able to see.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.176
If it'll help her.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.846
(sighs)

24:39.878 --> 24:42.147
What?

24:42.181 --> 24:45.451
Well, the nether realm exists
beyond the physical world.

24:45.483 --> 24:46.986
Accessing it is...

24:47.019 --> 24:49.355
Well, it's-it's kind of like
astral projection.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.523
It's very intense.

24:51.557 --> 24:55.862
I'd have to be your anchor,
keep you on this plane.

24:55.894 --> 24:58.329
I trust you.

24:58.364 --> 25:00.132
It-it's not like anything
that we've ever...

25:00.165 --> 25:02.268
I trust you.

25:04.069 --> 25:06.172
You miss me?

25:06.204 --> 25:08.540
I did, actually.

25:08.575 --> 25:11.109
Everything's okay?

25:12.377 --> 25:14.180
Everything is great.

25:14.212 --> 25:16.147
What about Faith?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.718
Faith has won
a fabulous trip to England,

25:18.750 --> 25:22.188
and I... got
the consolation prize,

25:22.221 --> 25:24.691
which is you.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.559
So I don't have to worry
about Faith showing up?

25:27.594 --> 25:31.063
Well, I have to admit, I was
kind of curious to meet her.

25:32.530 --> 25:36.167
Or I was until
about 30 seconds ago.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.069
Oh, you wouldn't have
liked Faith.

25:38.104 --> 25:42.074
She's not proper and joyless,
like a girl should be.

25:42.107 --> 25:45.944
She has a tendency to give in
to her animal instincts.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.718
Door's open.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.451
So?

25:53.484 --> 25:55.121
So my fantasies don't tend

25:55.153 --> 25:57.624
to include a bunch of
marines staring in at me.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.226
Oh, maybe they could
learn something.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.798
(groans softly)

26:05.832 --> 26:08.299
You're hurt.
(sighs)

26:08.334 --> 26:09.701
Um, not that bad, actually.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.303
I guess the, uh, drugs

26:11.336 --> 26:13.772
the professor gave me
really did make me stronger.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.907
I'm healing pretty quick.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.678
Maybe we should take you
for a test drive.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.847
Oh, wouldn't say no.

26:23.148 --> 26:26.986
So... how do you want me?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.089
How do I...?

26:31.123 --> 26:34.059
Yeah. What do you want
to do with this body?

26:34.093 --> 26:37.829
What nasty little desire have
you been itching to try out?

26:37.864 --> 26:39.932
Am I a bad girl?

26:39.965 --> 26:43.169
Do you want to hurt me?

26:44.435 --> 26:47.272
What are we playing at here?

26:48.674 --> 26:50.942
I'm Buffy.

26:50.977 --> 26:54.913
Okay. Then I'll be Riley.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.249
Well, if you don't
want to play...

26:57.282 --> 27:00.352
Right. I don't want to play.

27:28.547 --> 27:31.482
BOTH:
The inward eye,
the sightless sea.

27:31.517 --> 27:36.154
Ayala flows
through the river in me.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.892
The inward eye,
the sightless sea.

27:39.925 --> 27:44.029
Ayala flows through
the river in me.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.365
The inward eye,
the sightless sea.

27:47.398 --> 27:51.170
Ayala flows through
the river in me.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.207
...The sightless sea.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.544
Ayala flows through
the river in me.

28:02.580 --> 28:05.884
(heavy breathing)

28:11.390 --> 28:15.461
(breathing labors
and quickens)

28:25.570 --> 28:27.940
(heavy breathing)

28:32.111 --> 28:35.447
(gasps loudly)

28:38.549 --> 28:40.920
(breathing loudly)

28:49.796 --> 28:52.397
I love you.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.368
Oh.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.204
(panting)

28:59.238 --> 29:03.209
Get off. No.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.611
No. No. Get-get off!

29:05.644 --> 29:08.881
No. Off me. Get off.
Buffy.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.549
No, don't. Get...

29:11.583 --> 29:16.454
(panting)

29:16.488 --> 29:18.624
Buffy... what?

29:18.656 --> 29:21.460
What's wrong?

29:21.492 --> 29:22.828
(panting)

29:22.862 --> 29:24.262
Who are you?

29:24.296 --> 29:26.298
What do you want from her?

29:27.532 --> 29:30.402
Should I not have...?

29:30.435 --> 29:32.805
Thi-This is meaningless.

29:36.674 --> 29:39.310
You're shaking.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.947
(whimpers)

29:40.980 --> 29:42.748
Shh, shh, shh.

29:42.780 --> 29:45.984
(panting)

29:46.018 --> 29:48.453
What happened?

29:50.788 --> 29:53.125
Nothing.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.698
Nothing.

30:09.340 --> 30:12.344
I have a gift
no man has.

30:12.377 --> 30:15.346
No demon has ever had.

30:15.381 --> 30:18.683
I know why I'm here.

30:18.717 --> 30:20.286
I was created

30:20.318 --> 30:23.890
to kill, to extinguish life
wherever I find it.

30:23.923 --> 30:27.659
And I have accepted
that responsibility.

30:27.692 --> 30:29.862
You have lived in
fear and desperation

30:29.895 --> 30:31.297
because you didn't
have that gift.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.232
But it's time
to face your fear.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.703
Tell us what to do.

30:38.737 --> 30:42.574
You are here to be my first.

30:42.607 --> 30:44.710
To let them know

30:44.742 --> 30:46.979
that I am coming.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.147
We're ready.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.151
Then ask yourself, what is it?

30:52.183 --> 30:56.322
More than man,
more than anything else,

30:56.355 --> 30:59.625
what is the
thing you fear?

31:22.647 --> 31:25.084
Hope you left him alive.

31:25.116 --> 31:28.787
What?
Boy's supposed
to be on the mend.

31:28.819 --> 31:31.856
I don't see you letting him
get much rest.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.226
I think maybe you should stay
out of other people's lives.

31:34.259 --> 31:36.561
We've got a mission here, and
back when Riley could still

31:36.595 --> 31:39.065
think for himself...
You've got a mission?

31:39.097 --> 31:41.267
I've been fighting demons
since before you could shave.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.368
Yeah, you're a killer.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.570
I am not a killer.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.441
I am the slayer.

31:49.474 --> 31:51.876
And you don't know
the first thing about me.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.744
You really care what I think?

31:56.147 --> 31:59.651
No. I don't care.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.823
God, I don't care.

32:04.855 --> 32:06.724
(door opens)

32:06.758 --> 32:08.660
(door slams shut)

32:09.861 --> 32:12.263
(phone beeps off)

32:13.865 --> 32:16.301
They can't get us passage.
They've ordered the kill.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.604
Torch the place?
Get the gas.

32:22.307 --> 32:25.510
She could've killed
me. She didn't.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.778
Lucky you.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.780
(grunting)

32:31.450 --> 32:32.984
(chains jangling)

32:34.220 --> 32:37.623
(groans softly)

32:37.655 --> 32:40.058
Weatherby!

32:43.828 --> 32:46.531
Keys, keys.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.967
Stop her, you ponce.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.337
(gasps)

32:53.138 --> 32:55.941
(grunting)

32:55.973 --> 32:59.310
(panting)
Okay, I'm good at this.

33:00.811 --> 33:03.148
Ooh, drive.
(tires squealing)

33:19.397 --> 33:24.369
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Flight 454, service to San
Francisco, is now boarding...

33:24.403 --> 33:26.704
Okay, there you go.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.674
Thank you.
You're welcome.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.912
(indistinct voice over P.A.)

33:36.781 --> 33:38.217
Giles!
God!

33:38.250 --> 33:39.884
Don't move.

33:39.917 --> 33:43.755
Okay, Giles, you have to
listen to me very carefully.

33:43.788 --> 33:46.924
I'm not Faith.
Really?

33:46.958 --> 33:49.394
Really.
'Cause
the resemblance is striking.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.230
I know, Giles.
You just have to...

33:51.262 --> 33:53.565
Stop inching.
You were inching.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.000
Look, I know what
you're gonna say, and-and, uh...

33:56.034 --> 33:57.435
I'm Buffy.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.171
All right, I didn't know
what you were going to say,

33:59.204 --> 34:01.073
but that doesn't make you
any less crazy.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.875
Faith switched. I mean,
she had some device.

34:03.909 --> 34:06.144
She switched our bodies.

34:08.114 --> 34:12.518
Giles, I swear... it's me.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.588
Um, if-if you are
Buffy, then, uh...

34:16.621 --> 34:22.760
then you'll let me tie you up
without killing me, um,

34:22.793 --> 34:26.097
until we find out whether
you're telling the truth.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.467
Giles, Faith has taken my body,
and for all I know,

34:28.500 --> 34:30.601
she's taken it to Mexico by now.

34:30.635 --> 34:33.105
I don't have time
for bondage fun.

34:34.405 --> 34:38.143
Ask me a question.
Ask me anything.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.978
Who's president?
We're checking

34:41.012 --> 34:42.447
for Buffy, not a concussion.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.815
Oh, yes, right. Um...

34:43.849 --> 34:45.884
Oh, this is...

34:45.916 --> 34:49.085
Giles, you turned into a demon,
and I knew it was you.

34:49.121 --> 34:52.958
I mean, can't you just look in
my eyes and be all intuitive?

34:52.989 --> 34:55.561
How did I turn into a demon?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.896
Oh, 'cause, uh, Ethan Rayne.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.998
And-and you have a
girlfriend named Olivia,

35:00.030 --> 35:02.967
and you haven't had a job
since we blew up the school,

35:03.001 --> 35:05.271
which is valid
lifestyle-wise.

35:05.304 --> 35:09.007
I mean, it's not like
you're a slacker-type, but...

35:09.039 --> 35:11.143
Oh, oh! When I had
psychic power,

35:11.177 --> 35:12.610
I heard my mom think

35:12.643 --> 35:14.346
that you were like a stevedore
during sex.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.914
What...?
Do you want me to continue?

35:15.947 --> 35:18.250
Actually, I beg you to stop.
What's a stevedore?

35:18.284 --> 35:19.585
All right, let's...

35:19.617 --> 35:21.586
Um, I need you to
explain everything.

35:21.619 --> 35:24.190
And I will
 after we get Faith.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.324
Giles!
Will.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.460
Oh, my God.
Willow, wait.

35:28.494 --> 35:29.827
You don't understand.
You're Buffy.

35:29.860 --> 35:31.297
You and Faith
switched bodies,

35:31.329 --> 35:33.331
probably through a
Draconian Katra spell.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.000
She understands it
better than I do.

35:35.032 --> 35:36.668
How did you...?

35:36.702 --> 35:40.672
Tara. Tara, this is Buffy,
only really this time.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.641
Hi.
Tara's a really
powerful witch.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.610
Not really.
No, really.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.512
She knew right away
that you weren't you.

35:47.545 --> 35:50.181
So we connected
with the nether realms

35:50.215 --> 35:53.485
to-to find out what happened,
and we conjured this.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.422
What is...?
It's a Katra.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.192
Or the home-conjured version.

36:00.226 --> 36:02.159
It should switch you back,

36:02.193 --> 36:05.063
if you can get ahold of Faith.

36:05.096 --> 36:07.699
Oh, thank God.
(telephone rings)

36:07.733 --> 36:10.302
I'll get it.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.036
Hello.

36:12.070 --> 36:14.206
Do you know where Faith is?

36:14.239 --> 36:15.873
Yes, uh, Buffy's here

36:15.907 --> 36:17.175
with, uh, with me.
Actually, she...

36:17.208 --> 36:21.146
She's, uh...
Oh, all right.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.882
Xander. Apparently there's
a report on the television.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.152
WOMAN (on TV):
...and barricaded themselves
in the church

36:27.184 --> 36:29.221
with at least 20 parishioners.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.657
One of the few who escaped
described the three men

36:31.690 --> 36:34.025
as frighteningly disfigured.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.827
Almost inhuman.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.231
So far, one escapee has since
died of severe neck wounds.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.867
There is no report
on the condition of

36:41.900 --> 36:43.735
the parishioners
still trapped inside,

36:43.768 --> 36:46.271
but their assailants have vowed
to kill all of them

36:46.304 --> 36:49.407
if police attempt
to storm the church.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.246
It's hard to believe.

36:54.280 --> 36:58.384
I've been avoiding this place
for so many years,

36:58.416 --> 37:00.751
and it's nothing.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.788
It's nice!
(woman crying)

37:02.820 --> 37:07.592
It's got the pretty windows,
the pillars.

37:07.626 --> 37:10.628
Lots of folks to eat.
(woman crying)

37:12.630 --> 37:15.967
Where's the thing
I was so afraid of?

37:16.001 --> 37:18.403
You know, the Lord?

37:18.436 --> 37:20.905
He was supposed to be here.

37:20.938 --> 37:23.309
He gave us this address.

37:24.510 --> 37:26.277
Well,

37:26.311 --> 37:28.980
we'll just have to start
killing off his people,

37:29.014 --> 37:31.782
(people crying, whimpering)
see if he shows up.

37:31.817 --> 37:33.217
(siren blaring)
MAN: Is this the only
other entrance?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.719
Right here.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.255
What'd he say?

37:37.289 --> 37:39.958
He said I should
defer command to you.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.327
Then you hold your men
until the reserves arrive.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.795
This is a military situation.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.597
What, they got bombs
in there?

37:45.630 --> 37:48.634
Your men are not prepared to
deal with them. Just trust me.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.869
(siren toots)

37:56.641 --> 37:58.009
Buffy.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.445
How many are in there?

37:59.478 --> 38:00.846
We think there's three.

38:00.878 --> 38:03.114
I can do three.
Not alone.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.782
Look, wait for the
troops to get here.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.083
They're still mobilizing.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.018
How did you respond so fast?

38:08.052 --> 38:10.655
I didn't. I was just
late for church.

38:10.688 --> 38:14.525
Look, when the troops get here,
send 'em in, but I'm going.

38:14.559 --> 38:17.663
Look, I don't
want you risking...
Don't tell me what to do.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.532
I'm Buffy.

38:21.567 --> 38:23.768
I have to do this.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.003
Then I'm coming with.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.273
Ow!

38:29.306 --> 38:31.909
I can't use you.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.614
Someone comes out,
you get 'em to safety,

38:35.646 --> 38:38.048
unless they've got fangs.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.324
(growling)

38:48.393 --> 38:51.028
I told the cops,

38:51.061 --> 38:53.532
they send anyone in,

38:53.565 --> 38:55.833
I start the whole
massacre thing.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.202
(growling)
Well, I'm not the cops.

38:58.235 --> 39:00.572
I just come to pray.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.242
Now's a good time to start.

39:06.612 --> 39:09.280
You're not gonna
kill these people.

39:10.782 --> 39:13.050
Why not?

39:13.083 --> 39:15.820
Because it's wrong.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.255
(grunting)

39:18.289 --> 39:20.559
(woman yelling)

39:22.594 --> 39:26.164
You're the slayer.

39:26.197 --> 39:29.735
The one and only.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.369
(engine revving)

39:37.375 --> 39:39.510
You people,
get out of here!

39:39.545 --> 39:41.179
We've got to
get inside.

39:41.211 --> 39:42.713
The police are
handling this.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.349
Now just back
off right now.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.617
But we can't. We've got to...
You don't understand.

39:46.652 --> 39:48.420
Listen, you have
to clear the area.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.456
Damn it, man, we
have to get inside.

39:51.489 --> 39:55.693
Our, um, uh, uh,
our families are in there.

39:55.726 --> 39:59.130
Our, um, mothers
and-and tiny, tiny babies.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.666
You think we're afraid of you?

40:03.568 --> 40:05.135
We're not afraid
of anything anymore.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.472
Then let all these
people go, and

40:07.505 --> 40:09.373
all three of you can take me on.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.577
I got a better idea.

40:12.610 --> 40:17.282
(grunting)

40:21.686 --> 40:23.621
(people crying and whimpering)

40:27.992 --> 40:29.427
(groans, whooshing)

40:34.699 --> 40:37.869
(growling)

40:38.769 --> 40:40.905
(growling, groaning)

40:40.938 --> 40:44.175
(grunting, growling)

40:44.208 --> 40:47.077
(crackling, whooshing)

40:47.112 --> 40:49.447
You forgot your coat.

40:49.481 --> 40:52.751
Riley.
Oh. It's okay, miss.

40:52.784 --> 40:56.655
Get yourself out
of harm's way.
Riley, it's me.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.356
Never mind. How
many are in there?

40:59.389 --> 41:02.226
Well... Who are you?

41:04.394 --> 41:07.766
I have strength
you couldn't dream of.
(grunting)

41:07.798 --> 41:11.168
Adam has shown me the way,
and there is nothing... Aah.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.873
(whooshing)

41:18.710 --> 41:21.045
(grunting)

41:33.891 --> 41:37.262
You can't win this.
Shut up! Do you think
I'm afraid of you?

41:38.597 --> 41:39.965
You're nothing.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.367
Disgusting, murderous bitch.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.036
You're nothing.
(groaning)

41:45.070 --> 41:48.539
(groaning)
You're disgusting.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.942
(groaning, whooshing)

41:51.943 --> 41:54.045
(gasps)
(whooshing)

42:15.567 --> 42:17.335
She's gone.

42:17.367 --> 42:20.038
Not a trace.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.943
Giles said the Council guys
have cleared out, too.

42:27.445 --> 42:30.081
I don't understand.

42:30.114 --> 42:33.619
How could she have...?
I mean, how's it possible?

42:33.652 --> 42:36.588
Magic.

42:36.621 --> 42:38.389
I knew there was something.

42:38.422 --> 42:40.291
I should've picked up on it.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.728
I mean, I should have just...

42:51.168 --> 42:53.771
You slept with her.

42:58.777 --> 43:01.780
I slept with you.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.958
Man, would I like
to get my hands on her.

43:12.990 --> 43:15.193
Not in a sex way.

43:16.460 --> 43:18.596
I don't think she's coming back.

43:18.630 --> 43:21.032
Guess she's had her fun.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.670
Yeah.

43:25.704 --> 43:28.172
Fun.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.766
Grr. Argh.
