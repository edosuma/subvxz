YOU COULDN´T GET IN ANY SCHOOLS
AROUND HERE, HUH?

12:34.985 --> 12:39.129
ALL RIGHT, THEN, WHERE YOU GONNA
BE 10 YEARS FROM NOW, FOOL?

12:39.129 --> 12:41.761
I HOPE TO OPEN
A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION

12:41.761 --> 12:43.834
TO ASSIST PEOPLE
IN WHEELCHAIRS.

12:43.834 --> 12:48.268
TIRED OF DRIVING
YOUR BROTHER AROUND, HUH?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.901
SELFISH.
YOU DISGUST ME.

12:50.901 --> 12:52.242
GO AHEAD!

12:57.908 --> 13:02.052
HEY, THAT BETTER NOT
HAVE BEEN MY LAST BEER.

13:02.052 --> 13:03.884
OH, I´M SORRY.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.485
I WOULD GIVE IT BACK,

13:05.485 --> 13:09.219
BUT NOW IT IS COURSING
THROUGH MY ALIMENTARY CANAL,

13:09.219 --> 13:13.563
PUSHED FORWARD
BY TINY ESOPHAGEAL CILIA.

13:18.829 --> 13:22.802
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
HATES YOU HERE.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.474
WHAT?!

13:24.474 --> 13:28.178
YOU´RE A BURDEN TO EVERYONE.
YOU GET IN EVERYBODY´S WAY.

13:28.178 --> 13:31.181
YOU´VE BEEN HERE TOO LONG.
GO, GET A LIFE.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.544
NO ONE HAS TOLD ME THIS.

13:34.544 --> 13:36.947
I DON´T WANT TO BE
A BURDEN ON ANYONE.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.188
TOO LATE.

13:38.188 --> 13:41.191
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:41.191 --> 13:43.223
YOU ARE ALWAYS HERE.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.455
WHAT´S YOUR EXCUSE?

13:45.455 --> 13:48.859
I DON´T JUST
MOOCH OFF THIS FAMILY.

13:48.859 --> 13:50.400
I HAVE A PURPOSE HERE.

13:50.400 --> 13:54.004
HEY, GRANDMA, YOU LEFT
YOUR CIGARETTES IN MY ROOM.

13:54.004 --> 13:56.006
CAN I KEEP THE MATCHES?

13:56.006 --> 13:57.567
WHY, YOU CERTAINLY MAY.

14:00.210 --> 14:02.873
I´M A CAREGIVER.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.983
CARMEN, OPEN UP.

14:12.983 --> 14:16.987
GO AWAY! I ALREADY TOLD MOM
I DON´T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!

14:16.987 --> 14:18.528
I TALKED TO JASON.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.195
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

14:25.195 --> 14:29.099
DON´T WORRY. I TOLD HIM
IT WAS OVER AND THAT HE
COULDN´T SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:29.099 --> 14:30.370
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!

14:30.370 --> 14:31.501
I´M HELPING YOU.

14:31.501 --> 14:33.443
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAID TO ME?

14:33.443 --> 14:35.045
THAT HE COULDN´T
BE SEEN WITH YOU

14:35.045 --> 14:37.077
BECAUSE YOU´RE NOT
ONE OF THE POPULAR GIRLS.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.508
THAT WAS OUR DEAL!

14:38.508 --> 14:40.280
WHAT?!

14:40.280 --> 14:42.282
HE WAS TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.284
JASON IS SUPER-POPULAR.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.016
IF THE POPULAR GIRLS
FOUND OUT WE WERE DATING,

14:46.016 --> 14:47.387
THEY´D BE REALLY MEAN TO ME.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.259
SO, WHEN OTHER PEOPLE
WERE AROUND,

14:49.259 --> 14:51.191
WE WOULD PRETEND
NOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.123
HE DIDN´T WANT ME
TO GET HURT.

14:53.123 --> 14:57.267
OH, WELL, THANK GOD THERE´S
A LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

14:57.267 --> 14:59.299
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BEING USED.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.501
YOU´RE RIGHT,
HE´S SWEET.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.435
YOU JUST DON´T UNDERSTAND.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.407
CARMEN, THIS KID
DOESN´T CARE ABOUT YOU.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.240
HE´S EMBARRASSED
TO BE SEEN WITH YOU.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.013
WHERE´S YOUR SELF-RESPECT?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.684
I´M GONNA CALL HIM.

15:14.684 --> 15:16.046
NO!

15:16.046 --> 15:17.217
YES.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.119
CARMEN, NO.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.450
LISTEN...

15:20.450 --> 15:22.993
YOUR MOTHER WAS
A LOT MORE POPULAR THAN ME,

15:22.993 --> 15:24.554
BUT SHE TOOK ME EVERYWHERE

15:24.554 --> 15:27.327
NO MATTER HOW ASHAMED
SHE WAS.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.599
I´M GONNA SEE JASON AGAIN.

15:29.599 --> 15:33.233
WHERE? HE WON´T BE SEEN
WITH YOU IN PUBLIC, AND
HE´S NOT COMING HERE!

15:33.233 --> 15:36.266
HE´LL FIND A WAY.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.312
SOMETIMES YOU ARE DUMBER
THAN THE DOG.

15:42.312 --> 15:45.945
THE SONG ENDED.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.379
LOVE YOU.

15:52.482 --> 15:55.685
CARMEN SEEMS BETTER THE LAST
COUPLE OF DAYS, DOESN´T SHE?

15:55.685 --> 15:57.427
YEAH.

15:57.427 --> 16:00.730
I THINK WE CAN START GIVING HER
A KNIFE AT DINNER AGAIN.

16:00.730 --> 16:02.532
DID JASON CALL?

16:02.532 --> 16:04.264
NO.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.396
I´M SORRY, HONEY.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.070
CARMEN, YOU´RE BETTER OFF
WITHOUT HIM.

16:10.070 --> 16:14.244
NO, I WAS JUST STUPID TO THINK
HE´D EVER STAY WITH ME.

16:16.246 --> 16:17.607
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

16:17.607 --> 16:20.350
OUR DAUGHTER
HAS NO SELF-ESTEEM.

16:20.350 --> 16:24.214
I STAY STEER INTO THE SKID,
DYE HER HAIR BLOND,

16:24.214 --> 16:26.716
AND SEND HER
TO STRIPPER SCHOOL.

16:33.223 --> 16:35.625
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.528
VIC PALMERO
IS NOT A BURDEN.

16:38.528 --> 16:41.271
I´M LEAVING YOUR HOME.

16:41.271 --> 16:43.773
WHAT? NO, DADDY, NO.

16:43.773 --> 16:46.106
WE´RE GONNA NEED
THAT KEY BACK, BRO.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.411
DADDY,
YOU DON´T HAVE TO LEAVE.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.313
WE LOVE HAVING YOU HERE.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.644
OH, DON´T WORRY.

16:54.644 --> 16:59.119
I FOUND A CONDOMINIUM
IN ONE THOUSAND OAKS.

16:59.119 --> 17:04.154
I´M STAYING IN LOS ANGELES
TO BE CLOSE TO MY FAMILY.

17:04.154 --> 17:08.027
DADDY, I´M SO GLAD
YOU´RE GONNA STAY.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.529
BUT I WILL
HAVE MY OWN LIFE

17:09.529 --> 17:12.602
BECAUSE I AM PUTTING AN AD
ON cubancompanions.com.

17:12.602 --> 17:16.035
GEORGE,
TOMORROW I WILL NEED YOU

17:16.035 --> 17:19.069
TO TAKE AN ACTION PICTURE
OF ME IN A TANK TOP.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.574
GREAT. HE´S GONNA BE OVER HERE
ALL THE TIME.

17:24.574 --> 17:26.746
I MARRIED YOU, ANGIE.
I DIDN´T MARRY YOUR FATHER.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.320
WHY SHOULD I
HAVE TO SUFFER?

17:30.320 --> 17:35.125
OHH! TIME TO TAKE THESE PUPPIES
OFF THE LEASH.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.766
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

17:46.766 --> 17:48.768
I GOT IT.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.375
George:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:55.375 --> 17:58.248
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

17:58.248 --> 18:00.510
JASON, ARE YOU CRAZY?

18:00.510 --> 18:04.584
WHAT IF THE SUPER-POPULAR KIDS
SAW YOU?

18:07.657 --> 18:09.659
YOU MIGHT
LOSE YOUR REPUTATION

18:09.659 --> 18:12.322
AND BE FORCED
TO EAT LUNCH WITH...

18:12.322 --> 18:15.495
THE DEBATE TEAM.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.498
I´M CAPTAIN
OF THE DEBATE TEAM.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.530
O QUE LA...

18:26.276 --> 18:28.678
COME IN.

18:33.243 --> 18:35.745
I´M SORRY FOR THE WAY
I TREATED YOUR DAUGHTER.

18:35.745 --> 18:37.687
AND WITH YOUR PERMISSION,

18:37.687 --> 18:40.790
I´D LIKE TO TELL CARMEN
I´M SORRY.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.501
CARMEN, JASON´S HERE!

18:51.501 --> 18:53.703
THAT´S NOT FUNNY!

18:55.565 --> 18:57.837
NO, HE´S REALLY HERE!

19:04.574 --> 19:09.479
CARMEN, I´M SORRY
I WAS SUCH A JERK.

19:09.479 --> 19:11.581
YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK.

19:11.581 --> 19:14.754
YOU MADE ME GO THROUGH HELL
FOR A WEEK.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.686
YOU REALLY HURT ME.

19:16.686 --> 19:20.730
I KNOW, BUT...I WANT US TO BE
TOGETHER AGAIN.

19:22.332 --> 19:23.933
OKAY.

19:26.836 --> 19:30.200
YOU WANT TO COME TO FOOTBALL
PRACTICE AND WATCH ME?

19:30.200 --> 19:32.642
OKAY!

19:32.642 --> 19:35.174
Can I go, please?
Can I go?

19:39.579 --> 19:41.611
OKAY!

19:45.585 --> 19:48.788
THANKS, MR. AND MRS. LOPEZ...

19:48.788 --> 19:50.920
FOR EVERYTHING.

19:53.963 --> 19:56.926
WE DID A GOOD JOB
WITH JASON, ANGIE.

19:59.899 --> 20:03.773
GREAT, OUR DAUGHTER WITH
UNBELIEVABLY LOW SELF-ESTEEM

20:03.773 --> 20:05.875
IS DATING THE MOST POPULAR GUY
IN SCHOOL,

20:05.875 --> 20:07.807
AND SHE´LL DO ANYTHING
TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.510
YOU SEE ANY TROUBLE
DOWN THE ROAD THERE?

20:10.510 --> 20:14.284
AND NOW, GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
WELCOME ON THE MAIN STAGE,

20:14.284 --> 20:17.247
CARMEN LOPEZ!

20:17.247 --> 20:19.349
SHOW HER THAT YOU CARE,
BOYS.

20:19.349 --> 20:20.990
TIPS ON THE HIPS.

20:22.852 --> 20:26.256
GEORGE, THIS PICTURE
HAS TO WIN OVER THE WOMEN

20:26.256 --> 20:28.398
AT cubancompanions.com,
HMM?

20:28.398 --> 20:30.400
IT HAS TO SHOW
ALL MY SIDES.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.363
I WANT TO BE SERIOUS
BUT LIGHTHEARTED,

20:33.363 --> 20:35.505
SEXY BUT SOPHISTICATED,

20:35.505 --> 20:37.407
MATURE BUT, UH...

20:37.407 --> 20:40.910
WITH A PUPPYLIKE PLAYFULNESS.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.242
OKAY, I CAN GET THAT.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.714
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

20:44.714 --> 20:47.547
DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS?
CASTRO DIED.

20:47.547 --> 20:51.321
WHAT?! AY, DIOS MíO!
POR FIN LLEGO EL DIA!

20:51.321 --> 20:53.252
THAT´S A WRAP!
