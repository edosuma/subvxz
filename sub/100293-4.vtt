00:42.760 --> 00:46.160
Is there a better demonstration
of the sheer power of Nature?

00:47.480 --> 00:49.200
When I first saw this view,

00:49.240 --> 00:52.520
I was inspired to build
my Niagara Generator,

00:52.560 --> 00:55.920
and now these waters
power a city.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.760
But there's so much more
in Nature

00:59.800 --> 01:02.240
that cannot be seen
by the naked eye,

01:02.280 --> 01:06.200
forces invisible to us
which animate the universe.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.320
And they were hidden from
our understanding...until now.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.400
Gentlemen, I, Nikola Tesla,

01:14.440 --> 01:18.680
have invited you here
to pull back the curtain.

Shall we begin?

these forces of Nature

01:31.600 --> 01:33.920
on a scale never seen before.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.880
A world wireless system.

01:41.040 --> 01:44.760
A way for each of us to reach
beyond our immediate sphere

01:44.800 --> 01:47.600
into every corner of the Earth.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.360
(APPLAUSE)

01:49.400 --> 01:53.480
I only require the small
investment of $50,000.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.920
$50,000?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.000
A small price to pay

01:57.040 --> 02:00.200
to transmit energy through
the ether with no wires.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.320
You mean flying around
in the air?

02:02.360 --> 02:04.800
Poppycock! They're even more
far-fetched than those

02:04.840 --> 02:06.640
Mars stories that we've all
been hearing about.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.280
I'm sure you gentlemen
know better than to believe

- in the Times.
- Thank you, Miss Skerritt,

02:11.280 --> 02:13.440

a feeble electrical signal,

it comes from Mars.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.680
Oh, dear. How did this happen?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.000
I think an electric shock,

03:01.040 --> 03:02.800
What?

03:02.840 --> 03:04.960
One of these machines must have
killed him.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.280
That's impossible.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.920
All the apparatus here
is perfectly safe.

Nonetheless, Mr Tesla will be
happy to take a look.

Mm.

on a similar principle.

work out its purpose...

12:37.800 --> 12:39.080
It's an Orb of Thassor.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.400
But I've no idea
what it's doing here.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.240
The Thassor were
one of the ancient races.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.320
Amazing storytellers.
Inventors, explorers.

to spread information,

12:55.760 --> 13:00.040
to send out among the stars
as a way to share their legacy

13:00.080 --> 13:01.680
long after they were gone.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.200
Why would someone try to kill
us to get their hands on that?

how it feels -

and-and to make it real.

any greater thrill!

"This is the beginning!"

22:55.360 --> 22:56.840
(GROWLING HISS)

23:16.320 --> 23:19.120
There'll be more
where that came from.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.880
How about we try this again?
Who are you?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.520
Show your true form.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.600
Yaz! It's not Edison!

23:39.640 --> 23:41.840
I mean, it was, but it turns
out it's aliens, too.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.760
They can look like anyone,
so don't let anyone in!

23:44.800 --> 23:46.400
Tell Tesla! Tell Dorothy!

23:46.440 --> 23:47.800

I'm sorry.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.400
THE DOCTOR: Yaz?
Yaz, are you all right?

23:54.440 --> 23:57.920
- You are dead.
- We know you want the Orb.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.760
Let her go.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.880
Exactly - you don't
have to hurt her.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.720
With your levels of technology,

24:05.760 --> 24:08.320
you must understand
there is no need for violence.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.560
(DISTORTED)
We did not come for the Orb.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.120
We came for you.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.800
No!

24:54.080 --> 24:56.840
You're all right. You've
probably got questions.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.960
They took them.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.800
Where did they take them?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.760
We know they've got
cloaking tech,

25:03.800 --> 25:05.280
but if I rig a bypass...

25:06.560 --> 25:09.600
Luckily, high-speed inventing
is one of my specialisms.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.760
First time here can be a lot.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.800
It certainly is a lot.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.040
But you take it in your stride.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.000
Where do you even come from?

25:27.040 --> 25:29.320
Yorkshire, England.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.640
I was at home - you know,
normal life, work -

25:32.680 --> 25:35.160
then, boom - The Doctor.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.640
Changed my whole life.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.400
I was the same
before I met Mr Tesla.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.760
I wanted my own career -
something steady -

25:42.800 --> 25:46.200
then he showed me all these
discoveries that could be made.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.520
But it seemed like
impossible things.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.840
And now,
something normal, steady...

25:52.880 --> 25:54.080
Doesn't seem so important.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.920
We'll get 'em back.

25:57.960 --> 26:00.280
She's good at impossible, too.

Right, then.

extraordinary thing.

Yes.

never understood business.

got something, Doc?

26:38.040 --> 26:39.280
Of course!

26:39.320 --> 26:41.160
That's why they left it behind.

It's been hacked. It's not
broadcasting any more -

You mean it's a bugging device.

Thought so.

Moment I saw it.

THE DOCTOR: Exactly. Repurposed
from its original intent.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.160
It's been scanning the Earth
since it got here.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.520
(SCREWDRIVER BUZZES)

27:01.560 --> 27:04.920
And it must have finally found
what it's been looking for.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.360
What is this place?

27:10.400 --> 27:13.560
You stand in the Throne Ship
of the Skithra.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.760
High above your meagre city.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.680
You can see your city.

27:21.720 --> 27:24.160
But your city cannot see us.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.280
We have been watching,

27:28.320 --> 27:31.840
hidden from human eyes
while we searched.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.360
This is an electrical condenser
- from my generator.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.280
We have gathered supplies.
Now you will work.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.080
Work on what?

27:41.120 --> 27:44.240
Our ship. Our weapons.
Everything.

They're hiding their real faces
behind projections -

27:47.880 --> 27:51.320
they could look like anything,
be anywhere. There's no trail!

27:51.360 --> 27:53.120
If we're looking for
a trail to follow,

27:53.160 --> 27:54.760
what if Tesla already found it?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.280
DOROTHY: But he did.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.920
The Mars signal.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.320
I didn't believe him -
not really.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.760
But he records
all his observations.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.120
We have to go to Wardenclyffe.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.760
Wow. Now, this is a lab.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.080
Mr Tesla started transferring
all of his work

28:17.120 --> 28:18.760
to Wardenclyffe months ago.

28:20.320 --> 28:22.840
He intercepted
the Mars signal with this.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.360
He calls it his Teslascope.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.800
Here are
all the readings he took.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.200
They must have increased
the cloaking

28:28.240 --> 28:30.240
when they realised
he'd spotted them.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.760
Hey! Don't take
your eyes off him,

28:31.800 --> 28:33.760
and don't let him
touch anything!

halfway across New York.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.640
Yeah, well, keep it
to yourself,

or people'll say
you're as crazy as Tesla.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.120
That, my friend,
will never happen.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.160
Yeah, still -

bet you'd jump at the chance
to have him back working

- Yeah?

28:50.280 --> 28:51.880
- Yeah!
- How'd you figure that?

Cos I had a supervisor
like you at my old depot.

a bloke that much attention

unless you think
there's a pay-out coming.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.680

It must be here somewhere.

29:02.720 --> 29:05.960
Ah, I've found it!
The signal readout.

above New York.

we do - open a door?

I'd suggest we don't surrender
to the giant alien scorpion.

doesn't mean

you have to figure everything
out on your own.

On Earth, you are nothing.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.080

30:07.400 --> 30:09.200
it will be in the name
of progress,

30:24.400 --> 30:25.760

Bit wonky, but I can't take
the TARDIS.

enough power to transport me,

30:32.680 --> 30:34.400
But once I'm there,

30:34.440 --> 30:36.840
I can't jump back
until it recharges itself.

Which, you know,
I'm not worried about.

be worried about it either.

34:15.600 --> 34:16.400
Spot-on.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.320
(BUZZING)

34:21.360 --> 34:22.960
Listen up, Skithra queen,

34:23.000 --> 34:25.160
it's me, on behalf of Tesla.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.760
Consider this your official
eviction notice.

34:27.800 --> 34:31.120
Get your ship away from Earth
right now.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.960
QUEEN SKITHRA:
We will take the engineer

34:33.000 --> 34:35.320
or this planet shall burn!

34:35.360 --> 34:38.840
Surrender him
and your lives may be spared.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.720
You can't have him.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.000
He's with us.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.640
And we're not going anywhere.

34:44.680 --> 34:47.920
Then we will kill
all the teeming millions

34:47.960 --> 34:49.080
that infect this world.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.280
And you and your friends
will die first.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.280
This is the choice
you must make.

34:54.320 --> 34:57.360
Give us Tesla, or the planet -

34:57.400 --> 35:00.080
and all who live on it -
shall die.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.160
It cannot be me or the Earth.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.840
You can't place
this burden on me.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.160
Mr Tesla!

35:12.200 --> 35:15.120
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

35:16.440 --> 35:18.440
(GUTTURAL HISS)

35:18.480 --> 35:20.080
Find them.

35:35.320 --> 35:39.640
I've spent my life wondering
what might be out there.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.680
But creatures who would destroy
the whole planet

35:44.720 --> 35:46.600
just to get their hands on me?

35:48.160 --> 35:50.280
Recognition at last.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.360
(CHUCKLES)

35:55.360 --> 35:56.880
You do realise

35:56.920 --> 35:59.760
it's killing Edison that
they want you and not him.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.200
(EXHALES)

36:05.400 --> 36:08.520
This place, Wardenclyffe...

36:11.200 --> 36:12.800
...I was so close.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.200
People would finally see
what it can do.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.320
What I can do.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.240
Now no-one will ever know.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.800
You must all go.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.440
Let them take me.

36:27.480 --> 36:28.880
That's not going to happen.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.520
I have to surrender myself.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.200
There is nothing else
to be done.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.800
This is beyond me.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.560
No.

36:38.480 --> 36:39.440
No?

36:39.480 --> 36:43.400
Nikola Tesla, you're going to
change the world.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
But first, you're going
to save it.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.640
Now, tell me all about
Wardenclyffe.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.000
The tower works by harnessing

36:55.040 --> 36:57.440
the electric field
of the Earth itself.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.320
Here - my magnifying
transformer

37:00.360 --> 37:02.440
pumps millions of volts
into this tunnel.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.520
The current races down through
the Earth until it reaches

37:05.560 --> 37:09.400
the other side of the planet,
and then bounces back.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.520
Then it's channelled
into the tower -

37:11.560 --> 37:14.520
wave after wave after wave -
and up into the air!

37:15.800 --> 37:20.040
My intention was to build
a series of these towers...

37:21.040 --> 37:24.280
...transmitting energy
throughout the ether -

37:24.320 --> 37:26.560
a world wireless system.

37:27.960 --> 37:29.320
That's Wi-Fi.

37:29.360 --> 37:32.000
Did Tesla have the idea
for Wi-Fi?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.840
But with enough power,

37:33.880 --> 37:37.000
it could be used to send
a single bolt of lightning

37:37.040 --> 37:38.560
high up into the sky.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.240
Ah, well, if we generate one
large enough,

37:41.280 --> 37:43.760
it could strike the ship,
like so!

37:43.800 --> 37:45.760
Yes! High-five!

37:47.800 --> 37:49.160
Too early!

37:49.200 --> 37:50.720
In a pig's eye.

37:52.040 --> 37:55.280
You want to bet our lives on
a contraption like this, huh?

37:55.320 --> 38:00.480
Some fantastical idea no sane
man would ever invest in?

38:05.120 --> 38:07.320
At least I have ideas.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.000
You have filled a factory
full of men

38:09.040 --> 38:10.760
to do your thinking for you.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.960
Half of your inventions were
thought up by other people.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.320
Anyone can have ideas.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.080
I make them happen.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.520
All those men,
all those inventions,

38:19.560 --> 38:23.400
I turn them from a sketch into
real things people can buy.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.720
That's how you change
the world.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.840
You're too blind to see that my
factory is the best idea

38:29.880 --> 38:31.520
either one of us ever had.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.560
And you are too narrow-minded
to grasp the genius of my work,

38:34.600 --> 38:37.000
and that is why you will never
achieve real greatness.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.040
You are not a man of vision.
You're a man of...parts.

38:40.080 --> 38:44.040
Oi! AC/DC! You two might be
the greatest minds of the age,

38:44.080 --> 38:45.880
but is there any chance
you can stop squabbling

38:45.920 --> 38:47.560
while we try and save
the planet?

38:49.400 --> 38:50.720
We need to move quickly.
We have to prepare the tower.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.240
Here's what we're
going to do...

38:56.480 --> 38:57.880
You and me will finish
the tower.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.120
I can extend the TARDIS shields

39:00.160 --> 39:02.880
within the boundaries
of Wardenclyffe.

39:04.680 --> 39:07.600
That should keep us safe...
for now.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.200
Edison, Yaz - I need you to get
people off the streets.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.280

to defend Wardenclyffe.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.280

they've already found us.

Is it the accent?

39:29.520 --> 39:30.520
Please, it’s an emergency!

39:30.560 --> 39:33.680
- Please can you go inside?
- That fool Tesla

39:33.720 --> 39:36.160

I'd let you hide away

to take it.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.920
(SCREWDRIVER BUZZES)

46:49.960 --> 46:52.600
(ROARS)

46:52.640 --> 46:54.080
Tesla, now!

46:54.120 --> 46:55.200
That is it!

47:03.480 --> 47:05.240
(SKITHRA ROAR)

47:31.760 --> 47:33.680
There you go, kid.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.320
Thank you.

47:41.920 --> 47:44.400
I gotta hand it to you.

47:44.440 --> 47:45.680
You did it.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.360
Come work for me again.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.680
You keep working on this thing,

47:56.720 --> 47:58.640
you'll be bankrupt
within the year.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.120
Perhaps.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.800
But how could I stop now?

48:06.640 --> 48:08.080
(CHUCKLES)

48:09.840 --> 48:10.920
You take good care of
yourself.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.040
You too.

48:12.080 --> 48:15.520
Was that more or less
impossible than your usual day?

48:15.560 --> 48:18.400
Yeah, about average. You?

48:18.440 --> 48:20.200
Slightly stranger.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.240
Normal would be boring,
wouldn't it?

48:25.440 --> 48:26.880
Bye.

48:29.320 --> 48:32.920
Now, this all changes, right?
The protests, the funding.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.880
Tesla's tower's just saved
the world!

48:34.920 --> 48:36.680
That's gotta mean
rich and famous.

48:36.720 --> 48:37.720
No.

48:37.760 --> 48:38.880
Nothing's changed.

48:38.920 --> 48:42.000
A few years from now
Wardenclyffe is torn down.

48:42.040 --> 48:46.920
Tesla keeps on inventing,
but no money, no fame.

48:46.960 --> 48:50.320
He dies penniless.
History leaves him behind.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.120
But his vision of wireless
energy, that does happen,

48:53.160 --> 48:54.800
a connected world,

48:54.840 --> 48:57.280
and that idea starts here,
with him.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.600
That's not right.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.800
People should know.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.480
Either way, it doesn't change
what he's done.

49:02.520 --> 49:03.920
Doctor...

49:03.960 --> 49:06.520
You have to let me study
that machine of yours.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.840
It is by far the most
magnificent invention

49:08.880 --> 49:10.600
I've ever seen in my life.

49:10.640 --> 49:12.640
Never mind the TARDIS,

49:12.680 --> 49:15.120
you've got enough magnificent
inventions of your own.

49:16.360 --> 49:18.120
Yes. Yes, you're right.

49:18.160 --> 49:20.840
You're right, of course.
There's so much to be done.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.520
Thank you.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.720
Thank you, all.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.360
Don't give up.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.080
Whatever anyone says.

49:32.560 --> 49:34.280
Well, let them talk.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.080
The present is theirs.

49:36.120 --> 49:37.680
I work for the future.

49:40.360 --> 49:42.240
And the future is mine.

49:49.680 --> 49:51.440
Shall we?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.440
A Judoon warning transmission.

50:28.560 --> 50:29.600
Who are you?

50:29.640 --> 50:31.240
The city's under siege.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.880
- Do you trust me, Ruth?
- Sometimes.
