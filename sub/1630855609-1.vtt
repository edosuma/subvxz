02:23.519 --> 02:25.729
- I have a secret.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.945
Don't think what
I'm doing is easy.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.577
{\an8}My sister, 15,

02:39.702 --> 02:41.787
{\an8}trying so hard to look perfect.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.456
{\an8}She can't see she's
already beautiful.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.753
{\an8}My mom, she used to
smile all the time.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.005
{\an8}Where did that go?

02:52.256 --> 02:55.384
{\an8}And my dad on his computer.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.802
{\an8}He always says it's work,

02:56.927 --> 03:00.097
{\an8}but so many times,
it's really not.

03:02.850 --> 03:07.730
{\an8}I'm casting a spell to bake
us back together again,

03:08.355 --> 03:09.148
happy and sweet.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.157
{\an8}- You ready to go?

03:18.282 --> 03:19.325
{\an8}- Almost.

03:19.366 --> 03:19.950
{\an8}- Now we cannot be late, okay?

03:20.075 --> 03:20.784
{\an8}- Okay.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.747
{\an8}My family can't even see me.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.874
{\an8}- We have to leave,
like, right now.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.459
{\an8}- But my cookies
aren't done yet.

03:28.584 --> 03:29.960
{\an8}- She just wants
to ruin it for me.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.837
{\an8}- Come on, Violet, hurry up.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.844
{\an8}- Oh, yeah, my secret.

03:40.262 --> 03:43.015
Sometimes I think I'm a witch.

04:00.115 --> 04:00.991
As for that spell,

04:01.909 --> 04:03.953
I said it wasn't easy.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.747
And now, I've ruined everything.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.793
- Watch what you wish for.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.297
It's not making sense.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.714
Should I pull over?

04:16.839 --> 04:17.841
No, no,
no, keep going.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.053
Said one
lemming to another.

04:21.178 --> 04:21.887
Huh.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.222
- Quit it.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.390
- Violet.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.352
- Oh, go, go right at
this traffic circle.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.520
- Wait, wh-which right?

04:29.645 --> 04:30.479
There are, like, five choices.

04:31.522 --> 04:32.731
Hello? Any clues?

04:32.856 --> 04:33.649
I give up.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.775
- Typical.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.318
- What is that supposed to mean?

04:36.443 --> 04:37.111
- A'right, give me
the phone, I'll do it.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.406
- Can you? Why did
she have to come?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.866
- Found it. Thank God for me.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.047
Uh, miss, uh, miss...

05:05.597 --> 05:06.390
I guess that's her, right?

05:06.515 --> 05:07.850
- Yeah.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.105
- Everything is ready for you.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.733
Oh, Adam!

05:15.858 --> 05:16.942
- Yana, how are you?

05:17.067 --> 05:17.943
Good.

05:18.068 --> 05:18.986
- Good to see you.

05:19.111 --> 05:19.862
- Savannah.

05:19.987 --> 05:20.904
- Hi.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.364
- Hi.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.782
- And this is Chloe,
Savannah's mom.

05:23.907 --> 05:24.658
- Hi.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.958
So nice to finally meet you.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.501
You must be a model too.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.128
- I was, of course,

05:36.253 --> 05:38.547
but now Yana is
all about business.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.632
And Yana's business today

05:40.758 --> 05:43.052
is to find a face for her line.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.387
So let's go, people! Let's move!

06:31.391 --> 06:32.142
- Stop.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.221
- Not much to get excited about.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.056
I don't know.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.266
This one's pretty special.

07:35.831 --> 07:39.001
- Oh my God, Violet.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.752
Outside. Now.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.133
- Ciao.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.428
- Ciao.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.186
- I don't know what that means.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.151
- The auction place
where they sell the cows.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.237
- There's no cows here.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.113
- No?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.159
- That's mean.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.084
- Feel the light, feel
the beautiful light.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.473
- Que bello.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.893
I, I'm Daniele.

10:02.019 --> 10:02.769
- Violet.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.066
- You not one of them?

10:08.191 --> 10:10.527
No, are you?

10:10.652 --> 10:13.196
Eww, no.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.907
- So why are you here?

10:16.033 --> 10:20.037
- Boss lady, she's my matrigna.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.497
- Daniele, what are you doing?

10:22.622 --> 10:27.294
Where is my package?
Get inside now.

10:27.419 --> 10:32.215
- Stepmother. I,
I, I have to go.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.226
- See you, darling.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.897
What?

10:49.691 --> 10:51.318
- Why Savannah?

10:51.443 --> 10:52.694
- Trust me, she'll bring me

10:52.819 --> 10:53.820
the key to Paradiso.
- She's not

10:53.945 --> 10:55.322
the face of your collection.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.991
I know what look I
need, and I know...

10:58.116 --> 10:59.868
- Brava, Savannah.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.328
Congratulations.
- Uh.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.373
- This is Franco.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.415
- Oh, hi, I'm, uh, I'm Adam.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.875
This is my wife, Chloe.

11:13.590 --> 11:17.177
Thank you,
it's all so unexpected.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.180
Savannah has to
look like she's just...

11:20.305 --> 11:21.973
- It's about time.

11:22.099 --> 11:24.142
- And who is this little angel?

11:24.267 --> 11:25.936
- Oh, the naughty
daughter, Violet.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.479
Violet.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.606
She could be
a model like her sister.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.525
Look at this
contract, would you?

11:31.650 --> 11:32.401
- Sure.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.737
Oh, uh, it's, uh,
it's in Italian.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.533
- Oh, well, that
shouldn't be a problem

11:39.658 --> 11:40.367
for you, right?

11:42.202 --> 11:45.747
Uh, no.

11:46.873 --> 11:47.666
Thank you.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.215
Come on, you see what
Savannah was wearing today?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.259
I mean, a little slutty.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.385
That's
what kids wear now.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.845
For the last time, no!

11:59.970 --> 12:02.806
- How come it's fine
for her but not for me?

12:02.931 --> 12:05.100
- Your sister thinks this
is a big opportunity.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.102
I disagree, but she's old enough

12:07.227 --> 12:08.770
to start making
decisions like that.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.772
You on the other hand

12:12.107 --> 12:12.983
aren't quite there yet.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.568
- It's not fair.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.361
- When you're 15, if
you still want creeps

12:16.486 --> 12:17.863
like Franco to use your body

12:17.988 --> 12:19.364
to sell sleazy clothes, then-

12:19.489 --> 12:21.908
- I am not letting
Franco use my body.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.660
That's what
photographers do.

12:23.785 --> 12:24.953
- Hey!
- I know, I know

12:25.078 --> 12:26.580
what photographers do.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.206
That's why I'm taking
time off work tomorrow

12:28.331 --> 12:29.458
to make sure he doesn't.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.333
- Oh, right.

12:31.877 --> 12:32.878
- What?

12:33.003 --> 12:34.087
- Yeah, that's why you're going.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.131
- It is.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.884
- I'm not blind.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.437
- Listen, honey, we,

12:50.562 --> 12:51.563
we don't ever wanna stop you

12:51.688 --> 12:52.939
living the life you wanna live,

12:53.064 --> 12:55.942
but everything has a season.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.068
- What's the big deal?

12:57.194 --> 12:58.695
What are you so scared of?

13:03.408 --> 13:06.369
- There's things out there.

13:08.747 --> 13:09.498
- Out where?

13:10.707 --> 13:13.043
- Dangerous things
in, in, in the world.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.419
Your, your mother
and I just want you

13:14.544 --> 13:16.379
to, to, to stay safe.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.924
- You mean like
creepy men saying,

13:19.049 --> 13:20.300
"Get in my car, little girl.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.010
I'll give you some candy"?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.303
Yes, yes, but
not just stuff like that.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.179
- Then what?

13:29.059 --> 13:34.022
Look, it,
it's, it's like a plug,

13:36.566 --> 13:39.361
a really big one.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.030
Giant plug?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.740
- Yes, with a chain on it.

13:45.951 --> 13:46.952
- What if I open it?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.620
- No, no, no, don't do that.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.664
Well, the, the whole
world will get sucked down

13:50.789 --> 13:54.000
or

13:54.125 --> 13:56.044
bad things could come up.

13:59.673 --> 14:00.340
- Like what?

14:02.050 --> 14:02.926
What bad things?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.052
- Just don't open it,

14:07.597 --> 14:08.557
yet, okay?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.310
Come here.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.819
Love you, mm. Now,
get outta here.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.964
- You could destroy
us, you understand?

14:41.089 --> 14:42.716
Now look at me.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.307
Feel your power!

14:50.432 --> 14:52.017
A little more to
your left, that's it.

14:52.142 --> 14:57.105
Now, okay, okay.
You are a spider.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.274
- Eww.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.483
- No, no, you, you're
not really a spider,

15:00.609 --> 15:02.027
but you're like a spider.

15:02.152 --> 15:04.487
And you eat your
boyfriends for lunch.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.327
Okay, listen, it's
a metaphor, darling.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.287
Do you know what a metaphor is?

15:13.371 --> 15:14.706
That's it, that's great.

15:14.831 --> 15:15.790
That's great, perfect.

15:15.915 --> 15:16.625
Hold that!

15:18.668 --> 15:21.379
Okay, show me how
you devour your prey.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.505
Show me, I wanna see it.

15:22.631 --> 15:23.673
I wanna see it in your face.

15:23.798 --> 15:24.633
That's good.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.259
- You know what I mean?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.302
One foot forward.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.303
Now lean towards me.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.512
- Hey, Mom.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.681
- Hi, you want a gelato?

15:31.806 --> 15:34.726
- No, thanks. This is boring.

15:34.851 --> 15:35.685
- Oh, if I have to be here,

15:35.810 --> 15:36.936
you have to be here.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.527
- Can I go for a walk?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.614
- Why don't you just stay here?

15:47.739 --> 15:49.532
- But I wanna see the town.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.120
- Don't go outside the
walls, okay? Promise.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.832
Promise, Violet.

15:59.668 --> 16:03.171
- Fine, okay. I promise.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.174
That's
good, you are, uh,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.885
that's incredible.

16:09.010 --> 16:09.761
- Okay, alright.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.682
- Yes.
- That's it, alright.

16:25.110 --> 16:25.860
- Ciao.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.198
- Ciao, what are you doing?

16:30.323 --> 16:31.866
- I'm running away.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.618
- To where?

16:33.743 --> 16:34.494
- Out there.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.539
- There? There is only forest.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.499
- Sounds good to me.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.251
- No, it is not good.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.338
A witch sleeps
there, a real one.

16:45.463 --> 16:46.840
- Yeah, right.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.174
My farm
was there. I know.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.218
- I'd rather take my chances.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.388
- Daniele! You're
holding all of us up.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.814
- Be careful.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.648
Kill me,
kill me with your eyes.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.899
That's it.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.443
Now, give him more anger.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.945
More anger, I wanna
see more anger.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.571
That's it. No, that's
too much anger.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.531
Too much anger.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.573
Yeah, that's it.

18:35.698 --> 18:36.699
- Where's Violet?

18:36.825 --> 18:38.326
- She went for a walk.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.452
Look at me.

18:39.577 --> 18:40.620
- You let her go on her own?

18:40.745 --> 18:41.830
- Your daughter's all by herself

18:41.955 --> 18:43.331
in this scary old village

18:43.456 --> 18:45.250
with no big strong
man to protect her.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.169
- Yeah, well, you never
know what's out there.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.212
Not so sweet.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.630
- She'll be fine.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.847
- Put, put, put
one leg over this.

19:02.934 --> 19:03.726
- Daniele!

19:05.979 --> 19:06.729
Daniele!

19:11.985 --> 19:13.027
Daniele.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.612
What do you want?

19:14.737 --> 19:15.572
- Get off the scooter.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.115
- No, my father give it.

19:17.240 --> 19:17.907
- Look.

19:18.032 --> 19:19.325
- For me.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.036
- Calm down, I
have an idea, okay?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.121
- I said no.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.832
- Yana.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.876
- Daniele, do what he says.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.587
- Okay.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.760
- Get off the scooter!

19:41.681 --> 19:42.932
Savannah.

20:56.130 --> 20:56.923
- Mother.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.724
You gave me this gift.

21:08.518 --> 21:09.852
The flowers that love me.

21:11.729 --> 21:12.855
Is love the key?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.155
Speak to me.

21:42.385 --> 21:43.386
Why me?

22:05.241 --> 22:06.451
Will you teach me?

22:10.288 --> 22:13.833
I will listen to you. I promise.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.251
Oh, that's good.

22:15.376 --> 22:16.627
Now, move the hair
out of your eye.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.462
Yeah, yeah, that's
it, that's it.

22:17.587 --> 22:18.379
A little more.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.506
Okay, head back more.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.674
Put your, put your left hand

22:21.799 --> 22:23.009
on the back of the seat there.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.093
Nice, nice.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.511
- I won't stay here long.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.680
- Well, do you
want me to get off?

22:27.805 --> 22:28.723
- What do you want?

22:31.100 --> 22:32.977
- Ah, nice. You read my mind.

22:36.606 --> 22:37.774
- Hey, Savannah! Hold, Savannah!

22:37.899 --> 22:38.900
- Savannah!

22:39.025 --> 22:40.026
- Daniele!

23:28.533 --> 23:29.367
- Hello.

23:29.492 --> 23:31.369
- Hi, are you the witch?

23:37.166 --> 23:40.837
The
witch or a witch?

23:40.962 --> 23:42.797
- A boy told me a
witch lives here.

23:42.922 --> 23:47.343
- Oh, my name's
Hazel, what's yours?

23:47.468 --> 23:48.886
- Violet.

23:49.011 --> 23:51.889
- Well, Violet, if
you believe everything

23:52.014 --> 23:53.933
that boys tell you,

23:54.058 --> 23:56.018
you're gonna have
a very rough life.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.021
Oh, meet Delilah.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.278
Wanna see my garden?

24:06.821 --> 24:07.989
- Okay.

24:24.172 --> 24:24.922
Wow.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.432
- Ahh, ahh, ah, no, no.

24:34.557 --> 24:38.060
Naked Ladies, very dangerous.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.312
- Dangerous?

24:39.437 --> 24:40.188
- Poison.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.565
- And that one?

24:42.690 --> 24:45.776
- Oh, Angel's Trumpet,
extremely deadly.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.236
- Is everything here poisonous?

24:47.361 --> 24:48.279
- Not everything.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.252
- I know these.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.962
They won't hurt me.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.049
- Really? Well, it depends
on how you treat them.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.512
- Wow, nice.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.098
- You can have one
if you can reach it.

26:33.426 --> 26:34.802
Oh, come on, she's too young.

26:58.492 --> 26:59.577
Well, look who's up.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.203
- What happened?

27:01.329 --> 27:03.122
- That apple was too high.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.958
- No, the ladder was too short.

27:06.083 --> 27:06.792
- Oh.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.014
You hungry?

27:20.139 --> 27:21.223
- I guess.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.226
Are these poisonous too?

27:25.353 --> 27:26.812
- You're interested in flowers?

27:27.855 --> 27:29.940
- Flowers are interested in me.

27:30.066 --> 27:34.236
- Oh, so you know what
flowers are for then?

27:35.321 --> 27:38.240
- They aren't for anything.

27:38.366 --> 27:39.408
They're just flowers.

27:40.618 --> 27:43.579
- They're actually
sexual organs.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.334
- Eww.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.712
- There's nothing eww about it.

27:51.837 --> 27:52.630
It's just true.

27:55.132 --> 27:58.886
Well, except for those.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.971
What you think are their flowers

28:01.097 --> 28:02.223
are actually their stomachs.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.350
- Plants don't have stomachs.

28:04.475 --> 28:05.768
- They're carnivorous.

28:10.940 --> 28:15.403
They like their meat
fresh and alive.

28:22.493 --> 28:26.455
So all alone in the forest.

28:27.415 --> 28:30.459
Now, what's that about?

28:30.584 --> 28:33.295
- Well, everybody
else was so busy

28:34.296 --> 28:35.256
with my sister.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.427
- And you wish they'd
be busy with you?

28:39.552 --> 28:41.095
- No one even sees me.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.847
It's like I'm not even there.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.810
Mm, so you
want them to see you

28:47.935 --> 28:49.311
like they see your sister?

28:50.980 --> 28:53.107
- Not, not exactly.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.694
But why not? Seems like fun.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.322
- Oh, power is always fun.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.408
It's just not always safe.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.326
You
sound like my dad.

29:04.452 --> 29:08.330
He said, "It was
like a giant plug."

29:08.456 --> 29:09.206
- It?

29:10.332 --> 29:13.627
- You know, sex.

29:14.879 --> 29:15.963
He can't talk about it

29:16.088 --> 29:18.132
without getting embarrassed.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.344
- You wanna see it for yourself?

29:36.650 --> 29:38.694
- Um, how far are we gonna go?

29:39.653 --> 29:41.822
- Well, it's just through there.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.407
- What is?

29:43.532 --> 29:47.036
- Well, go and see.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.395
Go on, you'll be fine.

30:46.804 --> 30:47.513
- No way.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.584
Open it, open it.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.127
- Who said that?

31:18.252 --> 31:19.545
A friend, a friend.

31:19.670 --> 31:21.422
- How do I know
you're my friend?

31:21.547 --> 31:25.092
I'm
only trying to help.

31:29.722 --> 31:33.434
Peek underneath. You'll
laugh when you see.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.478
- When I see what?

31:36.604 --> 31:40.482
What
you've been looking for.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.085
Go on, pull!

32:10.220 --> 32:10.971
Harder!

32:41.877 --> 32:42.628
- Whoa.

33:01.772 --> 33:02.648
- Hello.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.279
- Who are you?

33:09.405 --> 33:12.032
- I'm not you, I'm me.

33:12.157 --> 33:16.036
- If you're not me,
then who are you?

33:17.538 --> 33:19.039
- If I asked you
the same question,

33:19.164 --> 33:20.624
I'd get the same answer too.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.626
- So where are you?

33:22.751 --> 33:24.795
- Here, you're looking
right up at me.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.046
- But I'm looking down.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.673
- No, I'm looking down.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.300
Can you find a rock?

33:30.426 --> 33:31.719
- What for?

33:31.844 --> 33:32.594
Can you?

33:38.767 --> 33:40.144
- Like this?

33:40.269 --> 33:41.937
- Yeah, perfect. Now
throw it up to me.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.439
- But you're down.

33:43.564 --> 33:46.692
- I told you, I'm
up, you're down.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.360
Now, come on, there's
not much time.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.528
- Time for what?

33:50.821 --> 33:51.697
Do you wanna find out

33:51.822 --> 33:52.823
what it's like or not?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.158
- Find out what what's like?

33:54.283 --> 33:56.410
- Just throw the stupid rock.

34:01.498 --> 34:02.207
Awesome.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.710
- I don't feel any different.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.837
- You will, here, catch.

34:38.202 --> 34:39.536
Better now?

34:40.621 --> 34:41.371
- What happened?

34:41.496 --> 34:42.748
- We switched.

34:42.873 --> 34:43.998
What? Okay.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.295
That was pretty cool,

34:48.420 --> 34:51.672
but let's switch back, please.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.842
- Not now, tomorrow
morning at sunrise.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.929
But if you're late,
you'll be stuck up there.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.139
And I'll be stuck
down here forever.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.391
- What? Wait.

35:01.517 --> 35:02.851
- Sunrise, promise?

35:02.976 --> 35:04.311
- Okay, okay, fine, I promise.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.729
- Don't forget to
put the plug back

35:05.854 --> 35:07.481
to make it all work, goodbye.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.899
- Wait. No!

35:09.024 --> 35:10.484
Stop! Please don't!

35:10.609 --> 35:11.485
Stop! No!

35:11.610 --> 35:13.153
No! I changed my mind!

35:20.869 --> 35:21.787
- Welcome.

35:22.955 --> 35:23.705
Welcome.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.085
- Please don't eat me.

35:28.210 --> 35:32.798
- Eat you? You mean as
if you were a cookie?

35:34.007 --> 35:34.716
- I'm not a cookie.

35:37.761 --> 35:38.846
- You smell like one.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.975
Shall I try just a little bite?

35:52.943 --> 35:54.945
Play time's over.

35:55.070 --> 35:58.448
Quick, off you go
before I change my mind.

36:01.201 --> 36:04.037
Good luck.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.344
- Well, what took you so long?

36:21.889 --> 36:24.766
- There's a huge creature thing

36:24.892 --> 36:26.643
who wants to, who
wants to eat me.

36:26.768 --> 36:28.228
- No, no, no.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.689
It just ate a bunch of
naughty boys last week.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.567
It can't possibly
have an appetite yet.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.152
- You tricked me.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.194
- Did I?

36:36.320 --> 36:37.279
- Where am I?

36:37.404 --> 36:38.363
- On the other side.

36:38.488 --> 36:41.783
- Of what? Looks the same.

36:43.619 --> 36:44.328
- Does it?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.791
- No, yes.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.629
But.

36:55.631 --> 36:56.381
Oh my God.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.760
Do I still have
parents on this side?

37:00.969 --> 37:05.724
- Of course, and a
sister, don't forget.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.809
And everyone else.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.982
But you seem to have
lost your flower.

37:16.902 --> 37:19.905
- Well, yeah, that
water's really cold.

37:21.156 --> 37:23.200
- Well, let's find you
something warm to wear.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.842
I thought you were gonna hurry.

37:41.802 --> 37:42.552
- I am.

38:04.157 --> 38:04.866
- Oh, look at you.

38:06.368 --> 38:07.828
You look gorgeous.

38:07.953 --> 38:10.038
You are gonna make a
beautiful young woman.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.873
Well, you already are.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.253
Ooh, try one of these.

38:16.378 --> 38:17.671
They are delicious.

38:23.385 --> 38:26.346
- Mm, oh my God.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.807
- Right, you know those people

38:28.932 --> 38:30.934
that you were so keen
to hang out with,

38:31.059 --> 38:33.895
they would never let
you near food like this.

38:34.021 --> 38:34.896
- That's messed up.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.275
- You know what's
really messed up?

38:39.776 --> 38:42.154
You not knowing how
incredibly pretty you are.

38:45.407 --> 38:46.158
So

38:53.123 --> 38:55.459
I want you to try
some of this drink.

38:57.794 --> 38:59.087
- No, thank you.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.964
- Come on, nothing
terrible's gonna happen.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.716
- I'm too young.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.594
- Not on this side, you're not.

39:05.719 --> 39:08.305
On this side, you know better.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.601
- So if I do something
on this side,

39:13.727 --> 39:14.978
does that change things

39:15.103 --> 39:16.188
on the other side too?

39:17.564 --> 39:19.983
- No more than any
action you take today

39:20.108 --> 39:23.695
could change the events
of yesterday.

39:24.946 --> 39:29.701
Unless, you've got to
make it to the plug

39:30.577 --> 39:32.329
before sunrise tomorrow morning

39:32.454 --> 39:36.541
because if you don't, you're
gonna be stuck on this side

39:36.666 --> 39:40.337
with all the choices
you've made forever.

39:46.259 --> 39:49.888
So, drink up.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.850
- I wanna go back now.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.102
Not 'til tomorrow morning.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.978
- I mean, to the town.

39:58.188 --> 39:58.980
- Oh.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.653
Well, well, off you go then.

40:04.778 --> 40:05.987
But you gotta be
careful, you know,

40:06.113 --> 40:08.949
those woods are very dangerous.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.368
You, you can always just

40:11.493 --> 40:12.994
stay here with me, right?

40:16.206 --> 40:18.291
Look, if you don't
like the fizz,

40:20.127 --> 40:21.545
try some of this lemonade

40:22.838 --> 40:23.839
my grandmother made.

40:23.964 --> 40:26.007
The secret is in the cinnamon...

40:32.264 --> 40:34.808
Oh, well, choose the right path.

41:07.382 --> 41:11.261
Boo, you
still smell like a cookie,

41:11.386 --> 41:14.055
and I'm feeling rather peckish.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.103
- Fancy meeting you here.

42:08.276 --> 42:09.444
- We need to talk.

42:10.403 --> 42:11.404
- Neutral ground?

42:28.505 --> 42:32.092
Go on, you'll be fine.

42:32.217 --> 42:34.135
Follow the red ribbon.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.726
- You know the rules.

42:41.851 --> 42:45.689
- And you know how
I feel about rules.

42:45.814 --> 42:49.109
- Paradiso is yours,
Inferno is mine.

42:49.234 --> 42:54.155
- Usually, but my girl
isn't usual, is she?

42:58.201 --> 43:00.287
- She's not yours.

43:00.412 --> 43:03.290
- Really? Are you sure?

43:05.041 --> 43:06.876
- Her sister's as good as mine.

43:07.002 --> 43:08.837
Her parents too.

43:08.962 --> 43:11.423
She can't hold out against
all of them, poor girl.

43:11.548 --> 43:13.174
It's only a matter of time.

43:15.051 --> 43:17.220
- And this key.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.431
- Yes, our mother's key.

43:20.348 --> 43:23.351
It must now pass to me.

43:23.476 --> 43:25.395
- It's not a trinket, Sister.

43:25.520 --> 43:28.690
It's what makes
the flowers bloom.

43:28.815 --> 43:30.233
You burned yours.

43:30.358 --> 43:33.153
There's nothing left
in you to bloom.

43:33.278 --> 43:36.281
And yes, the key must pass,

43:36.406 --> 43:39.075
but to a child of flowers,

43:39.200 --> 43:42.454
whom you've brought
to me.

43:42.579 --> 43:46.958
Would you even recognize
our mother if you saw her?

43:47.083 --> 43:48.209
I wonder.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.259
- You, you, you would never

43:56.384 --> 43:58.136
pass it on to that little brat.

43:59.429 --> 44:01.556
- I'd sooner give it to her

44:01.681 --> 44:03.350
than let you get your grubby

44:03.475 --> 44:05.226
little mitts all over it.

44:05.352 --> 44:07.228
- She wouldn't know
what to do with it.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.774
- And you would?

44:30.043 --> 44:33.546
Oh, name your price.

44:36.132 --> 44:39.052
- You could never pay it.

44:40.345 --> 44:43.640
It has to be given
freely, remember?

44:46.559 --> 44:51.272
- Fine, give it to her.

44:52.399 --> 44:54.651
Go ahead, see what happens.

46:07.307 --> 46:12.270
♪ And I went both
night and day ♪

46:16.608 --> 46:21.362
♪ And you wiped my tears away ♪

46:25.658 --> 46:29.621
♪ And I went both
day and night ♪

46:35.043 --> 46:38.922
♪ Here from my heart to you ♪

46:48.556 --> 46:51.559
It will
be fun.

46:59.234 --> 46:59.984
- Pardon.

47:01.319 --> 47:05.573
Hey.

47:05.698 --> 47:06.741
- Ciao, bella.

47:07.951 --> 47:10.787
Huh.

48:58.269 --> 49:01.606
- Savannah! Is it you?

49:01.731 --> 49:03.066
- Of course it's me.

49:03.191 --> 49:05.985
- Ah, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

49:07.236 --> 49:08.237
- Wherever I go, whatever I do,

49:08.363 --> 49:10.448
you just have to tag along.

49:11.574 --> 49:12.617
- Do not!

49:14.160 --> 49:15.995
Do you have any
idea where we are?

49:16.120 --> 49:18.665
- Ahh, duh, the hotel's
just around the corner.

49:18.790 --> 49:20.375
Oh, and Mom's worried about you.

49:20.500 --> 49:22.794
- No. No, I mean, this place.

49:22.919 --> 49:25.088
This other side, this!

49:25.213 --> 49:26.964
- What are you talking about?

49:27.090 --> 49:28.675
And where'd you get that dress?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.176
- An old lady gave it to me.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.636
- Yeah, right.

49:31.761 --> 49:32.845
Did she give you
that padded bra too?

49:32.970 --> 49:34.806
- Ah, I just saw
something awful!

49:34.931 --> 49:37.392
- So awful it made
you grow boobs?

49:44.232 --> 49:45.191
Hey, what'd you see?

49:50.863 --> 49:54.283
- Dad, with his arm around Yana.

49:55.284 --> 49:55.993
- That's all?

49:56.119 --> 49:56.828
- That's all?

49:57.745 --> 49:59.288
What if he's in love with her?

50:00.206 --> 50:01.124
- Don't be stupid, Violet.

50:01.249 --> 50:02.417
- I'm not stupid.

50:02.542 --> 50:04.711
It's just

50:04.836 --> 50:07.714
everything in this
world is so wrong.

50:07.839 --> 50:09.590
This isn't our real life.

50:09.716 --> 50:11.384
- Did that old
lady get you drunk?

50:11.509 --> 50:14.011
- No! But there's a way back.

50:14.137 --> 50:15.680
I jumped through it.

50:15.805 --> 50:17.640
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

50:17.765 --> 50:19.183
- Just listen to me.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.310
We can go back. The
both of us together.

50:21.436 --> 50:24.689
- Why? I'm having fun here.

50:24.814 --> 50:26.190
- You don't understand anything.

50:26.315 --> 50:28.359
- But can you just
quit being so crazy?

50:28.484 --> 50:30.027
And don't you dare tell Mom.

50:30.153 --> 50:30.945
- Girls.

50:31.988 --> 50:33.197
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

50:35.158 --> 50:36.659
- You rode away in the
middle of your job,

50:36.784 --> 50:38.870
without permission,
on a motorcycle.

50:38.995 --> 50:40.747
- It was a scooter.

50:40.872 --> 50:42.248
- And you! I almost had the
police out looking for you.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.750
I should just ground
you both for life.

50:43.875 --> 50:44.917
- Mom, nothing even happened.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.378
- That is not the point!

50:47.503 --> 50:48.588
Where'd you get that outfit?

50:48.713 --> 50:49.756
- Some old lady gave it to her.

50:49.881 --> 50:50.631
- What?

50:53.134 --> 50:55.428
Are you wearing a-
- Leave me alone.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.846
- Oh, forget it.

50:56.971 --> 50:57.847
Let's just start getting
ready for dinner.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.223
We shouldn't be late.

51:14.447 --> 51:17.575
- Wow. My girls look
beautiful tonight.

51:20.912 --> 51:22.789
Violet, that is a great dress.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.668
What happened? You,
you look kinda, oh.

51:31.130 --> 51:33.800
- Violet, sweetie,
where's your flower?

51:37.678 --> 51:38.429
- Uh.

51:40.139 --> 51:43.184
- You know, we got
some great stuff today.

51:43.309 --> 51:44.685
You both should take a look.

51:48.898 --> 51:49.774
- Oh, these are beautiful.

51:49.899 --> 51:51.150
- Wow. Thank you.

51:58.616 --> 51:59.325
- Whoa.

52:01.994 --> 52:02.745
What?

52:06.374 --> 52:07.875
When were these taken?

52:09.961 --> 52:10.795
These were awful.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.338
- Dad.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.131
- Those were taken
today, you were there.

52:14.257 --> 52:15.925
- I, I certainly wasn't.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.051
- Yeah, you were,
I could see you.

52:17.176 --> 52:18.678
You were reading your book.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.304
I must've
been on the phone.

52:20.429 --> 52:21.806
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

52:21.931 --> 52:23.182
You were telling me
a riveting story,

52:23.307 --> 52:24.976
something about, uh, your job.

52:27.937 --> 52:32.900
- Hmm, but Savannah
is beautiful. Yes?

52:37.029 --> 52:39.949
- Hello? The correct
answer is yes.

52:41.868 --> 52:43.536
- Where's Daniele?

52:43.661 --> 52:45.413
- Ugh, probably hiding from us.

52:45.538 --> 52:47.123
Knowing that boy.

52:47.248 --> 52:48.708
- He hates working for you.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.835
- Violet, mind
your own business.

52:57.300 --> 52:58.759
Why would anyone hide from you?

53:02.972 --> 53:05.016
- This one, Violeta.

53:07.226 --> 53:10.021
She has something so rare.

53:13.065 --> 53:13.774
So unique.

53:16.569 --> 53:19.113
Of course, it all
comes from you.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.955
- Mom, I don't feel very well,

53:28.080 --> 53:29.582
can I go back?

53:29.707 --> 53:33.169
- Great idea, get some
rest for the party.

53:33.294 --> 53:34.921
- I don't wanna
come to your party.

53:36.297 --> 53:38.341
- But I can still go, right?

53:39.884 --> 53:43.721
- These, uh, these girls
broke a lot of rules today.

53:43.846 --> 53:45.681
So they need to go to bed

53:45.806 --> 53:47.350
and think about that, hmm.

53:49.894 --> 53:51.187
Alright, go ahead, honey.

53:54.231 --> 53:55.733
- Mom.

53:55.858 --> 53:56.943
- Well, I mean,
everybody's gonna be there.

53:57.068 --> 53:59.779
Magazine editors, model scouts,

53:59.904 --> 54:02.907
designers from London,
Paris, Milan, New York.

54:03.032 --> 54:06.494
Of course, Savannah
will be guest of honor.

54:06.619 --> 54:09.830
- That's, that's
very kind, but umm...

54:09.956 --> 54:10.957
Well, we've decided that-

54:11.082 --> 54:12.208
- Oh, come on, Dad, please!

54:12.333 --> 54:15.044
- No. No, it's too much.

54:16.587 --> 54:17.922
- This is so unfair.

54:18.047 --> 54:19.840
- Savannah, end of discussion.

55:02.133 --> 55:03.551
- What are you doing?

55:03.676 --> 55:05.886
You can't go to the
party, Dad said so.

55:06.012 --> 55:07.388
Shut up.

55:07.513 --> 55:09.432
Dad is not gonna
know unless you tell.

55:09.557 --> 55:11.225
- Why do you even wanna go?

55:11.350 --> 55:13.686
Because I'm
the guest of honor, Violet.

55:13.811 --> 55:14.937
- They're just saying that.

55:15.062 --> 55:16.397
- Next time you see me,

55:16.522 --> 55:18.566
I'm gonna be on
the cover of Vogue.

55:18.691 --> 55:21.569
- Who cares? Everybody
there will be horrible.

55:24.196 --> 55:25.197
- Maybe you're right.

55:26.532 --> 55:27.908
Franco's kind of a creep.

55:28.034 --> 55:30.161
He looks at me like ugh.

55:30.286 --> 55:32.955
I mean while Dad is
drooling all over Yana,

55:33.080 --> 55:35.041
and he can't see she's
just playing him.

55:35.166 --> 55:37.293
- Says the girl that's
being played by Yana.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.463
- The only nice one's Daniele.

55:42.006 --> 55:44.258
- He's too young for you.

55:44.383 --> 55:46.302
- It was so cool,
holding him tight

55:46.427 --> 55:47.928
on the back of his bike.

55:48.054 --> 55:48.929
I could smell him.

55:50.222 --> 55:51.724
- Eww.

55:51.849 --> 55:53.726
- Yeah, it wasn't exactly
like a nice smell,

55:53.851 --> 55:55.936
but it was good.

56:35.101 --> 56:37.311
- Did you guys kiss?

56:37.436 --> 56:38.979
What? We were
in the middle of town.

56:39.105 --> 56:40.981
There are people,
like, everywhere.

56:42.858 --> 56:43.984
- So you didn't kiss?

56:47.655 --> 56:48.405
- Not yet.

57:10.010 --> 57:10.761
- Savannah.

57:13.389 --> 57:14.056
- Ciao.

57:14.181 --> 57:15.182
- Ciao.

57:15.307 --> 57:16.350
I can't believe this.

57:16.475 --> 57:18.352
How could you let this happen?

57:18.477 --> 57:20.104
Those pictures of Savannah.

57:20.229 --> 57:21.522
You basically signed
your own daughter

57:21.647 --> 57:23.232
up to make pornography.

57:23.357 --> 57:25.526
- No, no, I signed my
daughter up to be a model.

57:25.651 --> 57:26.402
Where were you?

57:27.987 --> 57:28.988
You were supposed to keep
an eye on that creep Franco,

57:29.113 --> 57:30.030
but somehow that never happened.

57:30.156 --> 57:31.448
- What does that mean?

57:31.574 --> 57:33.284
- You know exactly
what that means.

57:34.201 --> 57:35.661
- Is your sister with you?

57:35.786 --> 57:37.371
No.

57:37.496 --> 57:38.914
- Oh.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.082
- Are you here to
take me to the party?

57:42.459 --> 57:45.588
- Don't go. They're bad people.

57:45.713 --> 57:48.048
- It's fine, I'll
find it on my own.

57:48.174 --> 57:49.508
Oh, and don't bother
waiting for Violet.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.177
She's already asleep.

57:52.428 --> 57:54.471
- Oh. Oh, so it's my fault.

57:54.597 --> 57:56.182
I guess Yana's my fault too.

57:56.307 --> 57:57.266
- All right, can we please

57:57.391 --> 57:58.809
just go back to our room?

57:58.934 --> 58:00.019
- Why would I wanna
go back to the room?

58:00.144 --> 58:01.061
You don't wanna be with me!

58:01.187 --> 58:02.313
You wanna be with Yana!

58:02.438 --> 58:03.230
- Alright, listen to me.

58:03.355 --> 58:04.732
- Don't touch me!

58:04.857 --> 58:05.816
- All right, you
need to sleep it off!

58:05.941 --> 58:06.984
This conversation is over!

58:07.109 --> 58:08.402
- Yeah, this marriage is over!

58:08.527 --> 58:10.029
Fine by me!

58:19.163 --> 58:20.581
Violet.

58:20.706 --> 58:24.126
- Yana, Yana thinks that
she decides everything.

58:24.251 --> 58:28.380
But ,
Franco has the eye.

58:28.505 --> 58:32.176
Franco chooses who Yana sees.

58:32.301 --> 58:35.763
And Franco chooses
how she sees her.

58:35.888 --> 58:37.806
Okay, with...

58:40.851 --> 58:44.521
Without Franco,
Yana sees nothing.

58:50.277 --> 58:53.948
And don't forget,
be nice to Franco.

58:58.285 --> 58:59.036
- Savannah!

59:00.496 --> 59:01.705
- What are you doing here?

59:01.830 --> 59:03.165
- Coming with you.

59:03.290 --> 59:04.458
- No, you're not.

59:04.583 --> 59:05.876
- Please come back.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.711
- Leave me alone.

59:07.836 --> 59:09.088
- Are you meeting Daniele?

59:10.422 --> 59:12.091
- That's all you really
care about, isn't it?

59:12.216 --> 59:13.259
- Are you?

59:13.384 --> 59:14.593
- God, just quit following me.

59:14.718 --> 59:16.178
- I'll follow if I want to.

59:17.471 --> 59:18.806
He thinks you're a stupid cow.

59:18.931 --> 59:20.516
- Who? Who thinks
I'm a stupid cow?

59:20.641 --> 59:21.517
- Daniele, he told me.
- Daniele never said that.

59:21.642 --> 59:22.476
- Did too, yesterday.

59:22.601 --> 59:23.978
- Did not! Did not!

59:24.103 --> 59:25.104
- First thing when he
saw you at the audition.

59:25.229 --> 59:26.563
- You know, just because you

59:26.689 --> 59:28.232
suddenly grew a
pair of junior boobs

59:28.357 --> 59:30.359
does not mean you know anything.

59:30.484 --> 59:32.569
Daniele likes me,
and we're gonna kiss.

59:32.695 --> 59:34.238
- Fine! Go ahead!

59:34.363 --> 59:36.156
He's a jerk who only
wants to make out with you

59:36.282 --> 59:37.241
so he can brag about it!

59:37.366 --> 59:38.701
- Ugh!

01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:06.061
- Ciao.

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:07.688
- Ciao.

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:11.734
- Are you okay?

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:14.695
- I'm fine.

01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.949
- Did you go to the woods?

01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:23.495
- You were right
about the witch, hmm.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:26.540
- What happened?

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:27.416
- Nothing.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:30.169
- Are you sure?

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.630
- You're looking for her, right?

01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:38.135
- Who, Savannah? No.

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.805
- So, what are you doing here?

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:47.227
- I'm waiting, and
I'll wait some more.

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:48.020
- What for?

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:50.230
- To be grown up.

01:00:57.363 --> 01:00:58.864
What do you wait for?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:00:59.782
- Sunrise.

01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:04.828
- You're lucky,
tomorrow you go home.

01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:07.998
Never have to see
Franco or Yana again.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:16.840
- I'd like to see you again.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.385
- I would like to see you too.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.268
For you. For when you go away.

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:55.754
Wow!

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.298
She's a lying little hypocrite.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:01:59.383
But she was right about you.

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:00.509
- That's not what I meant.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.052
- Five minutes ago, she told me

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.303
that you were nothing
but a little jerk

01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:04.430
trying to make out with girls

01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:05.556
so you could brag about it.

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.102
Your exact words.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.103
- I hate you.

01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:12.938
- I hate you too.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.072
- Violet!

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:25.826
Violet.

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:36.587
- Chloe! Ah, I
thought it was you.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.133
It's nice to see you.

01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:46.638
What's wrong?

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:53.103
- Mom?

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.565
- Oh, oh no, Violet! Wait!

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.485
Wait, stop!

01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:02.946
Violet!

01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:20.672
- Don't mess with Franco!

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.178
If you do it again,
I will kill you.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.432
- No! Bastardo!

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.956
Jerry, ah.

01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.845
Ciao.

01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.014
Franco knew you would
never stay away.

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:13.559
And we're gonna find you
something fantastic to wear.

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:14.601
- Oh, but-

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.395
- You'll love it.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:23.652
- Uh.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:27.739
- You're early.

01:04:32.578 --> 01:04:35.163
- Go on! Do it!

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:36.540
- Do what?

01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:38.208
- Bite my head
off, I don't care.

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.002
- Why?

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:43.255
Because your parents turned
out to be merely human?

01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:47.009
- They could be humans
without being so selfish.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.470
- Oh, so you're giving up?

01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:51.930
- No, I'm going back,

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.765
where everything
else isn't so crap.

01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:58.437
- Huh? I thought you
were braver than that.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:01.648
- Brave? Nobody on
this side is brave.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.650
Everybody here is weak,

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.528
and mean, and selfish.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.363
And I don't wanna
see them anymore,

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.906
any of them.

01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:13.577
- What if they were all
the same on both sides?

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:14.745
What if it was you

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:17.080
who wasn't seeing them before?

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:19.541
- No, that's not how it is.

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.085
I'm going back,
and I'm going now.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.462
- It's too soon.

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:46.443
- Hey, where's my bike, huh?

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.028
- I washed it in the river.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.572
- No. No!

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:51.907
- Yes, sucker.

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:54.534
- Now, now, boys.
Let's play nice.

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:57.829
Guest of honor's here.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.999
- Savannah, what have
they done to you?

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.460
- Look how beautiful
we made you.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.546
- No, she was beautiful before.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.548
Now, she's just
like all the others.

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:25.816
- Violet! Violet, please.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:29.194
Where are you?

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.435
- Uh.

01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:43.643
- Savannah, we want
you to join us.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.605
Become a member of our family.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.567
Do you accept?

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.072
- Yes.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:32.692
- You know what to do.

01:09:55.442 --> 01:10:00.405
Now let's show
ourselves to the world.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.184
Go on.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:05.905
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:11.286
I want to welcome all of
you extraordinary people.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:16.374
You are the first to experience
the Paradiso collection.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:21.921
And now, I give you
the incomparable Yana.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.149
- I love beauty.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:45.153
Beautiful bodies,
beautiful clothes,

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.113
and beautiful lives.

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:50.033
So may I present to you

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.660
my beautiful birds of paradise

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.956
and my new
collection?

01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:17.787
- Violeta.

01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:28.631
Violeta! Violeta!

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:32.844
Violeta.

01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:37.056
- Daniele, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:41.811
- It doesn't matter.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.024
Are you okay? What happened?

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.983
- I'm fine.

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:50.278
- Come on, I take
you to the hotel.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:54.991
- No, wait, there's
this door in the forest.

01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.076
I gotta get to it
before sun comes up.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:00.663
- Maybe you hit
your head on a rock.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:01.998
- No, I didn't.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.001
Just trust me.

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.755
Just, please. Just trust me.

01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.050
Just trust me.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.472
Okay.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:19.307
- Wait, wait, what happened?

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:20.767
Have you seen Savannah?

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:23.269
- Yes, I did. She's
one of them now.

01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:24.354
- No, mm, she isn't.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.023
We have to save her.

01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:30.568
- Don't you worry. We're family.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.075
- Yeah.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:24.872
- Where is Savannah?

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.668
Where is Savannah?

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.838
- They took her to a room.

01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:32.714
- Where?

01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:47.937
Time to
decide, Savannah.

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:51.065
Are you ready?

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.276
Ready to take your
career to the next level?

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.364
- She's ready. I can tell.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.161
- Savannah? Savannah?

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.289
Violeta.

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:07.707
What are you
doing with my sister?

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:10.001
- Waiting for you, darling.

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.502
You took your time,

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.463
but I'm happy that
you're finally here.

01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:15.340
- Yes, but this, this dress,

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:16.883
I mean, Mamma mia.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.343
We'll get her something
much better, I promise.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.511
Not you.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.180
- Savannah? Are you okay?

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.515
- What are you
doing? It's too late.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.559
She's one of us.

01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.895
- Come on, we're gonna have
so much fun, I promise.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.521
What do you say, Violeta?

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:34.317
- But hey, you're
always welcome to join.

01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:36.778
- Savannah, I'm
taking you home now.

01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:38.321
It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.238
They're
both coming with me.

01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:40.698
- No, they're not.

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:44.702
Now clear out!

01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:47.288
- I love you.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:50.500
- Oh God.

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:51.626
- Love you.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.598
- Okay, let's get out of here.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.141
- What? Savannah?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.684
- What are you? What?

01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:09.894
What the hell

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.020
did you do?
- I'm clear.

01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.355
- Franco, forget the camera.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.439
- I'll kill you!
Look what he did!

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.316
Stop!

01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:17.527
- Now you're dead!

01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:23.449
Franco!

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:27.787
Oh God.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:30.415
Come on.

01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:42.987
- Savannah!

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.363
Hey!

01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:46.532
Savannah.

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:47.408
- Daniele!

01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:52.371
Daniele, Daniele.

01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:54.790
- Violet, where are you guys?

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:05.343
- Daniele.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.154
- Please, this is crazy.

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:26.656
Why is she so special?

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.908
- She has my key.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.076
- Your what?

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.577
- Let's go, move!

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.380
- Whoa! What is that?

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:43.589
- Don't just stand there!

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:44.549
Stab it! Kill it!

01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:45.550
- Are, are you kidding?

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.802
- No, do it. Now.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.472
- Shoo! Go away!

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:56.435
- Ooh, I'm so
scared. I'm shaking.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:58.646
- Look, final warning.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:01.774
- Careful, I'll kill
you with my eyes.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.903
- You know what? I'm done.

01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:08.447
This is your problem.

01:21:08.573 --> 01:21:09.532
Not mine!
- Franco.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:10.449
Franco, get back here now!

01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:16.664
I hate you.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.417
- I know. You fear
the me in you.

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:24.463
Which is why you can
never have the key.

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:28.426
Paradiso is mine
to give, remember?

01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.595
- To that little brat?

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.513
I'll just destroy her.

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:34.599
And then you'll fade to dust.

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:37.059
And my Inferno
will live forever.

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.981
- Live forever?
You're already dead.

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:45.693
And you just can't see it!

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.861
No!

01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:48.029
You're the one that's dead!

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.517
Would
you even recognize me?

01:22:18.643 --> 01:22:23.522
I wonder.

01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:38.871
No, no.

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.389
You've got
to make it to the plug

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.225
before sunrise tomorrow morning.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.601
- No, no, no, no.

01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:12.047
Oh, great.

01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.513
- I've got you now.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:23.100
What do you want?

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.812
- You, darling. It's
always been you.

01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:27.688
- Never.

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:55.758
- Fine. New offer.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:01.555
I let you go if
you give me that.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.224
- What? This?

01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:10.272
Fine, take it

01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:13.776
if you leave me, Savannah,

01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.694
and Daniele alone forever.

01:25:17.238 --> 01:25:17.988
- Deal.

01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:21.408
I promise.

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.918
You silly, silly little girl.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.462
You've just given me
the key, which means...

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:41.220
Why?

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:48.102
You.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.693
- Want to try again?

01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:56.819
- It's not a toy,

01:25:56.944 --> 01:25:58.112
you stupid, stupid little girl.

01:25:58.237 --> 01:25:59.780
No, it's mine!

01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:04.326
What? What are you...

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.787
Mother! You're
supposed to, stop!

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.290
Ah, no!

01:27:26.492 --> 01:27:29.787
- Hazel!

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:30.913
Hello?

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:43.717
Hazel! Hazel.

01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:28.762
- I knew you'd do well.

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:29.638
- Hazel.

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:36.645
Thank you. I didn't make it.

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.064
I'm stuck on the side forever.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:40.899
- Well, that's one
way of looking at it.

01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:46.071
You reached it after all.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:52.953
Life can be just as
magical with this garden.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.913
Only it's a lot more fun.

01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:04.590
Violeta!

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:08.927
Violeta!

01:29:09.053 --> 01:29:09.928
- Daniele!

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.098
Ciao.

01:29:14.016 --> 01:29:15.476
- Ciao.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.274
So you decide to stay?

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:23.150
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.281
Where's Savannah?

01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:30.574
- Let's go.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:39.917
- Savannah? Savannah!

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.585
- Violet!
