WEBVTT

00:43.652 --> 00:45.915
OK, cool.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.003
One more time.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.484
OK, right.

00:49.527 --> 00:52.139
OK.

00:52.182 --> 00:57.448
-Narrator:
Aristotle said there are
three types of friendship.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.755
The first is
friendship of utility,

00:59.798 --> 01:01.844
which happens
between you and someone

01:01.887 --> 01:04.890
who's useful to you in some way,
like a co-worker.

01:04.934 --> 01:07.632
The second is friendship of
pleasure, which occurs when two

01:07.676 --> 01:10.635
or more people just enjoy
one another's company.

01:10.679 --> 01:13.073
This can be a simple,
natural comradery,

01:13.116 --> 01:15.336
or even a
buddy.

01:15.379 --> 01:18.034
And the third,
called friendship of the good,

01:18.078 --> 01:21.342
is built on pure mutual
respect and admiration.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.822
Slower to develop,
but more enduring,

01:23.866 --> 01:26.347
it's the best
friend type stuff.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.089
I'm not saying I know more
than Aristotle, but I'd like to

01:29.132 --> 01:31.700
propose that there are
other types of friendship.

01:31.743 --> 01:35.443
One in particular I call
friendship of history.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.488
You were close
friends with someone,

01:37.532 --> 01:39.838
grew in different directions,
to be different people,

01:39.882 --> 01:45.931
but still act close,
just, well, because.

01:45.975 --> 01:47.324
It's just like seeing
a person wearing a

01:47.368 --> 01:49.196
life jacket in
the supermarket.

01:49.239 --> 01:52.024
You might ask, hey, why
are you wearing that?

01:52.068 --> 01:57.856
The other replies, because
I was on a boat yesterday.

02:04.211 --> 02:07.214
♪ Are you my
perfect cure ♪

02:07.257 --> 02:12.697
♪ Perfect cure for the
things that keep me awake ♪

02:12.741 --> 02:17.049
♪ I look for such a girl,
I'll never cause a stir ♪

02:17.093 --> 02:21.315

-Narrator:
This is Jonah,
those are his parents,

02:36.765 --> 02:39.507
and that was the best
picture taken that day.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.378
Tortured by their
constant judgement

02:41.422 --> 02:46.688
and unrealistic expectations,
their relationship was

02:46.731 --> 02:48.472
complicated.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.388
Jonah even once saved for an
entire year, sending them on a

02:51.432 --> 02:54.913
tour of wine country in an
attempt to win their approval,

02:54.957 --> 02:57.699
but as usual,
things didn't work out for him,

02:57.742 --> 03:00.702
and on their way to the last
vineyard an oncoming motorist

03:00.745 --> 03:06.229
collided with them, and both
parents died in a fiery wreck.

03:06.273 --> 03:09.232
After the funeral, Jonah learned
his parents were in severe debt,

03:09.276 --> 03:12.931
when the banks repossessed their
house and most of their savings.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.499
Confused, Jonah spent what
little money was left on a

03:15.543 --> 03:19.938
prostitute named Jolene,
whom he didn't ,

03:19.982 --> 03:21.766
but kept awake
all night talking,

03:21.810 --> 03:23.768
before she
eventually robbed him.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.166
What up?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.559
Are you home?

03:31.602 --> 03:33.604
No, just organizing shit
at my parents' place, why?

03:33.648 --> 03:35.302
Cool if
I stop by?

03:35.345 --> 03:36.955
Why are you calling
instead of texting?

03:36.999 --> 03:39.567
Just in
the area.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.264
Alright,
see you soon.

03:44.876 --> 03:51.143
Stupid, muthafucking, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.449
Ahhhhh!

03:52.493 --> 03:55.147
This is Jonah's
best friend, Richard,

03:55.191 --> 03:57.324
and his upbringing
was nearly the opposite.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.196
Close with his father and raised
in a household many would

04:00.240 --> 04:04.026
consider affluent, Richard
was, as you can clearly see,

04:04.069 --> 04:06.463
used to things
going in a certain way.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.987
His bank account has
over six figures in it, which

04:09.031 --> 04:12.556
he enjoyed spending lavishly
on his two best friends,

04:12.600 --> 04:14.166
but just
like his father,

04:14.210 --> 04:16.168
Richard is prone
to fits of rage,

04:16.212 --> 04:20.999
and one time threw his laptop
into his flat screen TV,

04:21.043 --> 04:22.827
all because he
couldn't remember the

04:22.871 --> 04:25.526
password to his
own email account.

04:25.569 --> 04:28.224
Stupid motherfucker!

04:28.268 --> 04:35.405
♪ Mellow, dreamy music♪

04:35.449 --> 04:36.841
Hey.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.194
What the hell
are you doing?

04:51.508 --> 04:54.076
Fucking.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.209
Richard!
Richard!

05:01.562 --> 05:03.738
What are
you doing?

05:03.781 --> 05:07.785
And this is Richard's
long term partner, Sacha.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.397
She grew up in a military house
who disapproved of the lavish

05:10.440 --> 05:12.616
lifestyle Richard
provided her with,

05:12.660 --> 05:17.317
especially her hot pink sports
car she named Ziggy Cardust.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.363
Speaking of cars, she was once a
witness in a hit and run case,

05:20.407 --> 05:23.235
but failed to show in court when
Richard and Jonah convinced her

05:23.279 --> 05:26.369
to get
drunk instead.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.545
But the accident did
inspire her to attend,

05:28.589 --> 05:30.286
and graduate from
nursing school,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.723
where she now spends her
days providing physical

05:32.767 --> 05:35.639
and emotional care at a
nearby retirement home,

05:35.683 --> 05:39.339
and the evenings and weekends
pretty much doing the same thing

05:39.382 --> 05:41.210
for these two.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.254
Richard.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.299
Get off!

05:43.343 --> 05:45.170
Richard, stop!

05:45.214 --> 05:47.129
Richard!

05:47.172 --> 05:48.783
Stop it!

05:48.826 --> 05:50.567
Get off him.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.314
Uh oh.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.409
Just,
how could you?

06:06.453 --> 06:07.584
How could
I what?

06:07.628 --> 06:08.629
Don't fucking
lie to me!

06:08.672 --> 06:10.108
Stop!

06:10.152 --> 06:11.458
I saw
the texts.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.850
What texts?

06:12.894 --> 06:14.286
The ones.

06:14.330 --> 06:20.423
The ones, oh, it
was such a mistake.

06:20.467 --> 06:23.383
How could you
fuck her, dude?

06:23.426 --> 06:25.123
You are way out
of line right now.

06:25.167 --> 06:29.824
You two
just stay here.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.739
I'm gonna get
something from the car.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.746
This kitchen
is fucked.

06:58.896 --> 06:59.984
What's this?

07:00.028 --> 07:01.203
I didn't have time
to wrap it yet.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.771
Happy early
birthday, a-hole.

07:03.814 --> 07:05.076
Huh?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.861
You think those texts
were from us fucking?

07:06.904 --> 07:08.819
It started off as a joke,
we convinced ourselves

07:08.863 --> 07:10.342
to buy you this
stupid thing.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.170
It's got a
mahogany stock.

07:12.214 --> 07:15.478
So the texts you read that say
that night was such a mistake,

07:15.522 --> 07:17.349
ha ha,
totally worth it though,

07:17.393 --> 07:19.656
and I guess as long
as he doesn't find out,

07:19.700 --> 07:23.007
that was just us talking about
buying you a damn harpoon,

07:23.051 --> 07:24.052
for your
birthday.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.183
Spear gun.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.316
Whatever.

07:28.709 --> 07:33.453
So,
you didn't?

07:37.544 --> 07:39.067
Oh no.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.084
And with that, just
like they always did,

07:56.127 --> 07:59.957
our trio returned to
their instinctual roles,

08:00.001 --> 08:02.220
Richard begging for
forgiveness for his latest

08:02.264 --> 08:05.354
and all too
often fits of rage,

08:05.397 --> 08:07.182
Jonah retreating
inside himself,

08:07.225 --> 08:10.925
reinforcing his beliefs that
the world is out to get him,

08:10.968 --> 08:13.754
and Sacha continuing
to play her role

08:13.797 --> 08:17.714
as girlfriend,
mother and referee.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.368
And while he
could have said sorry

08:19.411 --> 08:23.241
with even more
luxury items,

08:23.285 --> 08:27.550
Richard decided today
needed to be a special apology,

08:27.594 --> 08:33.556
by taking them out for one of
the group's favorite activities.

Alright.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.132
Look,
I'm trying, alright?

09:28.176 --> 09:29.133
Look at
my face.

09:29.177 --> 09:30.308
Look at
his face.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.614
OK, hey,
let's make a deal,

09:31.658 --> 09:34.835
I grovel and pamper you
guys unconditionally,

09:34.878 --> 09:38.403
and you just try to remember a
time before I went ape shit.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.491
I want
a free punch.

09:39.535 --> 09:40.536
Yes, deal.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.624
Punch where?

09:41.668 --> 09:42.712
I like this,
this plan makes sense.

09:42.756 --> 09:43.800
No, it doesn't.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.497
I want
reparations.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.153
Even Steven.

09:49.197 --> 09:54.550
Exactly.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.638
Not the balls.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.683
Please,
the balls.

09:56.726 --> 09:57.814
Not the balls!

09:57.858 --> 09:58.815
Stay
out of it.

09:58.859 --> 09:59.860
Why are you
encouraging this?

09:59.903 --> 10:01.252
What if my nose
needs surgery?

10:01.296 --> 10:02.471
You could have a deviated
septum, causing irregular

10:02.514 --> 10:03.907
sleep patterns and
long term health issues.

10:03.951 --> 10:04.604
For fucks sakes, just punch
me and shut the fuck up.

10:04.647 --> 10:05.996
Deal.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.519
But only one punch,
and then, then you'll chill.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.564
Fine.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.652
Both of you.

10:09.696 --> 10:10.827
No, this
doesn't involve me.

10:10.871 --> 10:11.915
What if I
let you punch me?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.090
You know
where I'm going.

10:13.134 --> 10:14.657
I said
no balls.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.225
No dice, I'd just as easily
go get day drunk somewhere.

10:17.268 --> 10:20.837
Fine, but just remember, it
behooves you to avoid these guys

10:20.881 --> 10:22.839
if you ever want
little Richards one day.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.406
Excuse me.

10:24.449 --> 10:27.670
Wait, no wait, afterwards,
that's it then, it's squashed.

10:27.714 --> 10:34.285
I don't want to hear another
word about this shit again.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.373
Alright.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.548
Alright.

10:36.592 --> 10:37.593
Fuck it,
let's do it.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.681
Hands
behind your head.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.204
No, no, actually,
behind your back.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.989
You're gonna
want those fingers.

10:42.032 --> 10:44.382
And eyes shut, I don't want you
anticipating where it's going.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.470
That's good.

10:45.514 --> 10:46.558
Stop squirming.

10:46.602 --> 10:47.647
You ready?

10:47.690 --> 10:48.691
Yeah,
I'm fucking ready.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.779
Give it to him.

10:49.823 --> 10:50.867
Alright,
you know what.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.434
What?

10:52.477 --> 10:53.914
It's alright.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.045
Ha ha.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.264
Fuck,
my wrist.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.569
Serves you right.

10:57.613 --> 10:58.440
Just making sure you
wouldn't get a concussion

10:58.483 --> 10:59.702
you
fucking asshole.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.225
A punch like that, I
doubt you could anyways.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.444
You got fire
in your hands.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.185
Oh, dude,
she can chuck bombs.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.100

11:06.143 --> 11:09.059
Arms behind your back,
please, thank you.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.582
Stop
moving around.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.236
Hey, no, hey, hey, hey, just
remember, it behooves you.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.238
Stop saying behooves
and uncross those legs.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.110
Stand up, and
take it like a man.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.372
Come on you little bitch,
close your eyes.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.460

11:19.591 --> 11:20.680
Just close
your eyes.

She can't punch
that hard, can she?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.030
Yeah.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.292
Oh.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.076
Oh.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.556
Almost threw
up right there.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.037
Oh.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.909
Are you sorry?

11:32.953 --> 11:34.781

11:43.964 --> 11:45.269

13:31.462 --> 13:33.029
Can't breathe out
of my left nostril.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.553
For all I know I could
be bleeding out inside.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.033
Like, the Houdini.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.426
He died from
taking a punch.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.431
-Jonah:
You think someone
could swim that far?

13:43.474 --> 13:46.826
-Richard:
Not a fucking
chance, too far.

13:53.658 --> 13:55.312
Hey, can I ask
you something?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.924
Shoot.

13:57.967 --> 14:01.579
What made you think we
were messing around?

14:01.623 --> 14:03.494
I know it wasn't
just the texts.

14:03.538 --> 14:04.626
You wouldn't just
jump to that conclusion

14:04.669 --> 14:08.238
without something
else first.

14:08.282 --> 14:11.415
Sometimes,

14:11.459 --> 14:13.722
sometimes it feels
like you care about her

14:13.765 --> 14:16.768
the way that I
care about her.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.604
Without sounding
like a prick.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.779
You're gonna
sound like a.

14:27.823 --> 14:31.305
When are you gonna
stop fucking around?

14:31.348 --> 14:36.353
Look, I know you don't
like me bringing it up,

14:36.397 --> 14:40.923
but you saw what kind of
trouble you caused last year.

14:40.967 --> 14:44.622
I appreciate your concern, but
until you're in a relationship

14:44.666 --> 14:47.799
longer than three months,
don't give me advice.

14:47.843 --> 14:48.931
I don't
with you.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.628
You do,
actually.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.326
I just try and tell you
how to keep them around,

14:52.369 --> 14:54.067
so you can stop
fucking prostitutes.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.459
Once.

14:55.503 --> 14:58.332
Still man.

15:04.512 --> 15:09.604
A couple weeks back you guys got
into it at my place, remember?

15:09.647 --> 15:13.477
What was
that all about?

15:13.521 --> 15:16.959
Um,
I don't know.

15:17.003 --> 15:21.268
I don't really remember,
but it must not have been

15:21.311 --> 15:22.486
a big deal
or anything.

15:22.530 --> 15:23.618
The fuck you
talking about?

15:23.661 --> 15:24.967
You two were steaming
from the ears.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.013
Well, she was probably
just venting about your

15:27.056 --> 15:29.319
extra-curricular
activities.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.799
What did
you say?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.891
Well,

15:35.935 --> 15:40.896
nothing about
what happened.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.160
OK, look, there's this quote,
and it's something to the effect

15:44.204 --> 15:53.300
of we accuse people of doing
things that we do ourselves.

16:13.146 --> 16:16.453
How do
I look?

16:16.497 --> 16:17.541
Like
an idiot.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.195
That sounds
about right.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.370
Let's try
this thing out.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.893
Do I
have a choice?

16:21.937 --> 16:23.547
Come on, it all started
'cause of this fucking thing.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.723
Alright, go.

16:25.767 --> 16:29.249
Uno,
deuce, tre.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.033
Happy birthday.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.689
Now,
give me back my sun.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.169
I got something!

16:36.212 --> 16:39.737
Nice.

16:39.781 --> 16:45.395
Hey,
are we good?

16:45.439 --> 16:48.268
Yeah,
we're good.

16:54.883 --> 16:58.626
You know, a couple weeks back
when you and Jonah got into it

16:58.669 --> 17:03.239
at my place, I think that's
where I started to get it into

17:03.283 --> 17:06.938
my head that something was
going on, so sorry about that.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.070
I said
we're good.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.900
What were you guys even
fighting about, anyway?

17:11.943 --> 17:13.771
I don't know, probably
that stupid thing.

17:13.815 --> 17:17.513
Didn't have
anything to do with us?

17:17.558 --> 17:18.776
Huh?

17:18.819 --> 17:20.996
You know, what's been
going on between us.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.607
No, we don't talk
about that shit.

17:23.651 --> 17:29.048
We were just arguing
about your gift.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.488
Hey, check
this bitch out!

17:55.117 --> 17:56.118
Hey.

17:56.162 --> 17:59.121
Huh?

17:59.165 --> 18:04.126
You're lurking.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.128
I'm fine.

19:00.574 --> 19:01.923
You got three
seconds to tell me

19:01.966 --> 19:03.185
what the fuck
is going on.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.273
Listen.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.622
One.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.710
Man,
nothing is going on.

19:06.754 --> 19:07.798
Two.

19:07.842 --> 19:08.843
Richard, please.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.584
Three.

19:14.936 --> 19:19.027
He figured it
out, didn't he.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.725
Uh oh.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.770
He asked me about the
night we were fighting.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.424
What the fuck did
you say to him?

19:24.467 --> 19:27.078
I don't know, I just said it was
something about your guys' shit.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.384
What the
fuck, Jay?

19:28.428 --> 19:30.256
I don't know, it just
kind of fucking came up.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.388
He was gonna shoot
you with the harpoon.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.563
Spear gun.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.564
Whatever.

19:34.608 --> 19:35.739
No, no,
he wouldn't shoot.

19:35.783 --> 19:36.784
Look at
your face.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.046
Fuck your
fucking face.

19:38.089 --> 19:39.917
Ahhh!

19:44.922 --> 19:47.142
How could you?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.404
Which part?

19:59.894 --> 20:03.593
Not the balls.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.900
Fuck!

20:05.943 --> 20:09.077
Oh fuck!

20:09.120 --> 20:10.687
Oh fuck!

20:10.731 --> 20:13.951
You were gonna fucking
kill me, you fuck.

20:17.128 --> 20:18.173
Help.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.261
Help.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.306
Help
somebody please.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.961
Stop!

20:31.578 --> 20:35.712
Stop!

20:35.756 --> 20:37.279
Why him?

20:37.323 --> 20:40.630
Why him?

20:57.691 --> 20:59.475
Holy fuck.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.093
He wakes up again,
we're fucking dead.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.486
If he doesn't kill
us, his dad will.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.096
No way, I've known
him for too long.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.229
Jay!

21:15.970 --> 21:19.321
Richard's father is the reason
for his six figure bank account,

21:19.365 --> 21:22.498
and the source of his violent
temper, so while I wish I could

21:22.542 --> 21:25.762
give you an example of something
nice he's done for someone else,

21:25.806 --> 21:30.201
the only story that comes
to mind goes as follows:

21:30.245 --> 21:31.899
Years back it
came to light that

21:31.942 --> 21:34.380
Richard's first grade
teacher was, let's say,

21:34.423 --> 21:37.208
being inappropriate
with students.

21:37.252 --> 21:40.386
A few weeks later, as the school
conducted a full investigation,

21:40.429 --> 21:43.345
the teacher
suddenly disappeared,

21:43.389 --> 21:45.869
which also happened to
coincide with Richard's father

21:45.913 --> 21:48.132
and a few of his
rougher colleagues,

21:48.176 --> 21:56.489
taking a road trip
that very same weekend.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.751
Fuck.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.361
We'll say
the truth.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.537
We went fishing, he found out
we were sleeping together.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.540
Slept.

22:04.584 --> 22:07.891
Sorry, you
know what I mean.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.415
No, no,
exactly.

22:09.458 --> 22:12.156
He found out we slept together,
he came after us,

22:12.200 --> 22:13.244
a fight
ensued and.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.595
Jay!

22:18.946 --> 22:20.948
Fuck.

22:24.517 --> 22:27.258
Oh man, it doesn't
seem safe to me,

22:27.302 --> 22:31.393
but if you insist on resting
right there, by all means.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.569
What?

22:33.613 --> 22:36.398
This way if they hook
us up to one of those

22:36.442 --> 22:38.269
lie detector things,
we can say he fell off,

22:38.313 --> 22:41.969
and the machine won't go
off like the fourth of July.

22:44.319 --> 22:50.064
Although, his dad's still
gonna fucking kill me.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.806
At least you'll be
in the clear, though.

22:56.810 --> 23:00.857
He has eighty thousand
in a safe in his closet.

23:00.901 --> 23:03.817
His dad gives him ten
grand cash every Christmas.

23:03.860 --> 23:07.473
The combination is the last four
digits of his phone number.

23:14.741 --> 23:18.527
Come on,
you fuck.

23:18.571 --> 23:24.141
Here,
try this.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.101
Seriously?

23:27.144 --> 23:28.319
What?

23:28.363 --> 23:30.060
Just a
little exercising.

23:30.104 --> 23:34.021
Come on,
the lie detector.

23:34.064 --> 23:39.461
Yeah, just getting in a little
bit of exercising, that's all.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.636
Don't even
look at him.

23:40.680 --> 23:46.163
Taking
the d off.

23:46.207 --> 23:47.382
Yeah.

23:47.426 --> 23:52.387
Gotta make sure you
get your squats in.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.998
There we go.

24:24.419 --> 24:28.205
How's this fit into
the lie detector?

24:28.249 --> 24:30.294
You two were gonna
fucking drown me?

24:30.338 --> 24:31.600
Hey, you tried
to kill us first.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.037
I wasn't gonna hurt you,
you dick, what the fuck?

24:34.081 --> 24:35.430
You had the
harpoon aimed at him.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.518
Spear gun.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.389
You fucking
waved that at me.

24:38.433 --> 24:39.521
You
strangled me.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.566
It doesn't matter anyway,
because you,

24:40.609 --> 24:42.089
you're in
the water.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.438
What the fuck,
you pushed me.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.440
No, no,
actually I didn't.

24:45.484 --> 24:50.314
You rolled in when you
were drunk and confessed.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.055
I don't
think so pal.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.230
Fuck you.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.232
Fuck you,
you cheating bitch.

24:55.276 --> 24:56.451
Hey,
you did it first.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.583
That was
a year ago.

24:57.626 --> 24:58.845
Come on, Jay,
we're out of here.

24:58.888 --> 24:59.889
Wait.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.064
Fuck off.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.065
Fuck, fuck.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.415
See you
later, pal.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.418
She can't drive the
boat worth shit anyway.

25:14.991 --> 25:19.387
What?

25:19.430 --> 25:20.519
Uh oh.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.347
Ha ha,
looking for these?

25:23.391 --> 25:24.435
Give me those.

25:24.479 --> 25:25.524
Give them back.

25:25.567 --> 25:26.568
Fuck you.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.656
Where the fuck
are you going?

25:27.700 --> 25:28.918
Swimming
this way.

25:28.962 --> 25:29.919
Get back here,
I will shoot you right now.

25:29.963 --> 25:30.964
Shoot me.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.922
I'll drop the
keys, fucker.

25:32.966 --> 25:34.097
Get back in
the fucking boat.

25:34.141 --> 25:35.577
What are you gonna
do, drown yourself?

25:35.621 --> 25:37.448
Apparently I was
gonna drown anyway,

25:37.492 --> 25:39.320
might as well take
you fucks with me.

25:39.363 --> 25:42.410
Get back in the
fucking boat, Richard.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.933
We need to
make a better deal.

25:43.977 --> 25:46.414
What deal?

25:46.457 --> 25:50.287
We need to promise not
to kill each other.

25:50.331 --> 25:55.292
What I want to see is guys
take every weapon on the boat,

25:55.336 --> 25:56.946
chuck
it overboard.

25:56.990 --> 26:01.168
That's the spear gun,
the club, the cutlery.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.997
The glass bottles,
the flares, the oars, fishes.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.129
fucking everything.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.828
Once I'm convinced that
there's nothing on there

26:08.871 --> 26:10.525
that you guys can
use against me.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.918
Or you could
use against us.

26:11.961 --> 26:16.879
Then, and only then, I
will swim back, and we'll,

26:16.923 --> 26:19.534
we'll
just go home.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.014
And once we're back?

26:21.057 --> 26:23.799
As far as I'm concerned,
I don't want to see

26:23.843 --> 26:25.584
either of you two
sacks of shit ever again.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.628
You won't
call the cops?

26:26.672 --> 26:27.803
Or tell
your dad?

26:27.847 --> 26:30.632
No cops,
no dad.

26:34.854 --> 26:38.945
Don't think too long, this
key is feeling pretty heavy.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.545
Now get back in
the fucking boat.

Sacha.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.694
He getting it?

27:32.738 --> 27:33.739
I think so.

27:33.782 --> 27:34.827
It's underneath
the stairs.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.306
No,
it's not.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.656
It's down
there somewhere.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.875
I'm looking with
one fucking hand.

27:39.919 --> 27:43.313
It's a golf club
for Christ's sake.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.054
Hey, Sacha,
where are you going?

27:48.014 --> 27:49.058
He needs
my help.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.320
I need her
help finding it.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.714
He doesn't need shit,
you're staying here.

28:01.592 --> 28:04.073
Lovely day, huh?

28:04.117 --> 28:06.162
I got it.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.603
There.

28:12.647 --> 28:16.607
That's it, now get back
in the fucking boat.

28:16.651 --> 28:17.696
Suck a dick.

28:17.739 --> 28:18.914
Get in the
fucking boat.

28:18.958 --> 28:23.614
There's nothing left
on the fucking boat.

28:27.967 --> 28:29.055
Fuck off.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.144
Get the fuck up
there, let's go.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.119
No, other side,
let's go.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.214
Let me see.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.346
He'll be fine.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.304
We'll worry about it
when we get back.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.240
What?

29:26.721 --> 29:28.723
Are you
kidding me?

29:28.767 --> 29:33.684
Please tell me
you're kidding me.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.645
Coast Guard one.

29:37.688 --> 29:40.517
Coast Guard one.

29:40.561 --> 29:41.605
Coast Guard one.

29:41.649 --> 29:42.824
Coast Guard one.

29:42.868 --> 29:49.439
This is the pleasure
vessel Naughty Buoy.

29:49.483 --> 29:53.008
Coast Guard one.

29:53.052 --> 29:56.707
Coast Guard one.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.492
Coast Guard one.

29:58.535 --> 29:59.885
Coast Guard one,
do you hear me?

29:59.928 --> 30:01.843
Did you try all the
stations, turning the dials.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.714
Well that explains why you spent
four years in school

30:03.758 --> 30:06.021
becoming a glorified
butt wiper, doesn't it?

30:06.065 --> 30:09.590
OK, I obviously
do more than that.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.592
Coast Guard one.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.463
Hello?

30:13.507 --> 30:18.599
Can anyone save me
from these two pricks?

30:18.642 --> 30:19.992
You two.

30:20.035 --> 30:22.908
You two are real pieces
of work, you know that?

30:22.951 --> 30:25.519
I can't believe I let you
convince me that I was such

30:25.562 --> 30:27.390
a prick that I
deserved punches.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.435
Don't even.

30:28.478 --> 30:31.525
No,
this isn't right.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.615
I want reparations,
I deserve reparations.

30:34.658 --> 30:35.746
We said
no killing.

30:35.790 --> 30:36.878
I'm talking
Even Steven.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.401
You beat me up,
I punched you back.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.577
I beat your ass because
you fucked my girlfriend.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.057
And then you punched
me off the boat.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.711
After she hit me
with the bottle.

30:43.754 --> 30:44.799
And then you shot
me in the hand.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.409
No, she shot you
through the hand.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.803
How is
this helping?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.936
Well it certainly looked like it
helped you after slapping me.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.067
You want to
punch me, Richard?

30:52.111 --> 30:54.853
You damn
right I do.

31:02.295 --> 31:05.907
You two knowingly made me feel
like such a piece of shit

31:05.951 --> 31:09.041
that I volunteered
for free punches.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.912
And then
you willingly,

31:10.956 --> 31:15.438
no wait, you gleefully
went along with it.

31:15.482 --> 31:18.485
What kind of scumbags
do that, huh?

31:18.528 --> 31:21.096
Huh?

31:26.319 --> 31:27.363
Put your hand
on the table.

31:27.407 --> 31:28.451
What?

31:28.495 --> 31:33.108
Put your hand on
the fucking table.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.154
When you got
busted this morning,

31:35.197 --> 31:38.070
you could have been
a man about it, huh?

31:38.113 --> 31:43.118
But you decided to
take the bitch route.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.816
Time to
make up for it.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.961
Oh.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.920
Other hand.

32:01.963 --> 32:02.964
Richard.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.313
Shut up.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.881
Other hand.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.584
OK, look.

32:14.628 --> 32:15.672
Fuck.

32:15.716 --> 32:16.760
Stand up.

32:16.804 --> 32:17.848
Richard,
I swear to God.

32:17.892 --> 32:18.893
It's fine, Jay.

32:18.937 --> 32:19.981
You owe me.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.026
I don't
owe you shit.

32:21.069 --> 32:22.157
-No?
-No.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.202
How's
that now?

32:23.245 --> 32:24.551
This is
just karma.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.161
Oh, so you fucked him
to get back at me, huh?

32:26.205 --> 32:30.687
It wouldn't even come close to
what you've put me through.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.167
Jay.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.866
He tell you
what happened?

32:35.910 --> 32:39.479
It wasn't just that
Richard was fucking his ex.

32:39.522 --> 32:42.917
No, she showed up at
the door, pregnant.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.789
And as if that wasn't enough,
she wants to keep the baby,

32:45.833 --> 32:49.532
be a part of the family, have a
little bit of daddy's money.

32:49.576 --> 32:52.274
But instead I let
this asshole convince me

32:52.318 --> 32:54.363
that it was
just a big mistake.

32:54.407 --> 32:57.540
His last big mistake,
and that he would talk to her,

32:57.584 --> 33:02.067
and convince her to
have an abortion.

33:02.110 --> 33:07.376
And then a month later I see
in the paper and on the news,

33:07.420 --> 33:10.379
pregnant girl Melissa
Fairfax stabbed to death.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.772
I told you a million
times, we didn't.

33:11.815 --> 33:17.473
How can I believe
anything you say?

33:17.517 --> 33:20.128
I mean, Jesus, I would have been
gone so fucking fast if I hadn't

33:20.172 --> 33:21.782
been so scared you would
do the same thing to me.

33:21.825 --> 33:22.913
No,
I would never.

33:22.957 --> 33:27.396
Really?

33:55.337 --> 34:00.125
Hey dipshit, you forget to throw
these overboard on purpose?

34:00.168 --> 34:03.998
I must
have forgot.

34:12.266 --> 34:15.270
Damn it.

34:27.108 --> 34:30.590
Alright, this is
what we've got left.

34:36.509 --> 34:37.900
That tuna could
have come in handy.

34:37.945 --> 34:39.033
That tuna
was a weapon.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.295
This is all
the water?

34:41.340 --> 34:43.123
There's nothing left in
the showers, nothing?

34:43.168 --> 34:44.473
We didn't
fill the tanks.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.996
I thought it
was a day trip.

34:47.041 --> 34:50.000
Look, this is gonna keep
us OK for a couple days.

34:50.043 --> 34:51.132
It's not the food
I'm worried about.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.219
Why not?

34:52.264 --> 34:53.308
You can go for
ages without food.

34:53.351 --> 34:55.831
Without water,
less than a week.

34:55.876 --> 34:57.660
Huh?

34:57.704 --> 34:59.575
I could share some other
things I learned in school,

34:59.619 --> 35:01.229
but why
bother, right?

35:01.273 --> 35:02.578
I'll just make sure to ask you
when it's time to wipe my ass.

35:02.622 --> 35:03.666
Yeah.

35:03.710 --> 35:04.754
What about
the toilet?

35:04.798 --> 35:05.842
You mean
where you belong?

35:05.886 --> 35:06.930
The water
in it.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.018
It's salt water.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.107
We could
distill it.

35:09.150 --> 35:10.151
No, the
still's propane.

35:10.195 --> 35:11.370
We don't
have propane.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.327
So literally nothing
on this boat works?

35:12.371 --> 35:13.676
I thought it
was a day trip.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.025
What about
the life raft?

35:15.069 --> 35:16.331
We popped that
inner tubing.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.724
Fuck's sake.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.465
I didn't anticipate having
to discard everything

35:19.508 --> 35:21.206
in an effort to
ensure my safety.

35:21.249 --> 35:22.381
OK, we can start
swimming to shore.

35:22.424 --> 35:23.469
It's too far.

35:23.512 --> 35:24.600
How do you
know that?

35:24.644 --> 35:26.254
It's too far.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.690
You know at Jaws at the end of
the movie, when the two are just

35:27.734 --> 35:29.127
swimming in the ocean,
after they killed the shark.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.346
Those fuckers are
dead, straight up.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.043
So wait,
get going.

35:33.087 --> 35:34.175
Fuck off.

35:34.219 --> 35:36.699
So what
you're saying

35:36.743 --> 35:38.005
is we're
screwed?

35:38.048 --> 35:40.921
No, there's a bunch of
shipping lanes out here,

35:40.964 --> 35:42.052
someone's bound
to spot us.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.097
You sure?

35:43.141 --> 35:44.185
Pretty sure.

35:44.229 --> 35:45.230
Give me odds,
I want odds.

35:45.273 --> 35:48.581
90/10.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.060
10 being no
shipping boats?

35:50.104 --> 35:53.238
Yeah.

35:53.281 --> 35:58.721
OK, well 90% I'm rescued,
that's not so bad.

36:06.251 --> 36:09.123
As the chapter title
so eloquently states,

36:09.167 --> 36:11.995
our trio had fallen on
a stretch of bad luck,

36:12.039 --> 36:14.911
but as an experienced sailor
such as myself would tell you,

36:14.955 --> 36:18.088
superstitions on a
boat are a powerful thing,

36:18.132 --> 36:21.222
and these three had been
inadvertently pushing their luck

36:21.266 --> 36:23.920
from the very start,
and here's why,

36:23.964 --> 36:26.401
first of all they all set sail
on the Friday of a long weekend,

36:26.445 --> 36:28.098
when less ships
would be departing.

36:28.142 --> 36:30.231
It's also terrible luck
to sail on a Friday,

36:30.275 --> 36:32.146
as this was the day
Christ was crucified.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.409
Then Richard stepped on
board with his left foot

36:34.453 --> 36:36.194
rather than
his right.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.152
Red haired people are also
considered bad luck on a boat.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.762
Don't know why,
they just are.

36:39.806 --> 36:40.894
You're also not
supposed to bring

36:40.937 --> 36:42.330
anyone named
Jonah on board.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.766
When the group threw
everything off the boat,

36:43.810 --> 36:46.073
they even tossed a
metal albatross statue.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.596
A bigtime
no-no,

36:47.640 --> 36:49.250
as they're supposed to
host the souls of dead sailors.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.252
Having a black bag on
the boat represents death

36:51.296 --> 36:52.993
and the depths
of the sea.

36:53.036 --> 36:55.430
And bananas on board are a bad
omen for a multitude of reasons.

36:59.695 --> 37:02.655
So when no shipping
boats appeared,

37:02.698 --> 37:06.006
no rain fell to
catch and drink,

37:06.049 --> 37:11.620
and the current pulled them
further into the Atlantic Ocean,

37:11.664 --> 37:15.450
they flirted with yet
another form of friendship,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.322
friendship of survival,

37:17.365 --> 37:20.020
in which you either
work together,

37:20.063 --> 37:22.805
or you're

37:39.344 --> 37:40.867
Dude, this is
impossible.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.529
If only we had,
say, a harpoon.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.488
Spear gun.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.273
This is
useless.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.013
Come to
daddy, baby.

37:58.754 --> 38:01.279
Oh, and one last no no on
a boat, don't kill seagulls.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.193
That's a real
bad one too.

learned at school?

39:39.638 --> 39:41.248
No, I got this from
Richard Parker.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.336
Who?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.424
The lion
from Life of Pi.

Tiger.

39:44.643 --> 39:45.948

39:45.992 --> 39:48.124
Author got the idea
from Edgar Allen Poe,

39:48.168 --> 39:49.952
and I have

39:49.996 --> 39:54.914
had a boyfriend
named Richard.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.481
OK.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.309
So in like the 1800s, Poe
wrote a book about a shipwreck,

39:59.353 --> 40:01.442
so these guys get
stuck in a lifeboat.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.749
Out of food and water,
but they capture a sea turtle

40:03.792 --> 40:05.315
and drink its
blood to survive.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.317
So let me get this straight,
you're getting your survival

40:07.361 --> 40:12.584

about the spaghetti monster.

nourishes them for a while,

40:28.382 --> 40:29.862
but it's
not enough.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.298
And they can't
catch any more turtles,

40:31.341 --> 40:32.734
and after a few
days they realize

40:32.778 --> 40:34.214

40:34.257 --> 40:36.825
ASAP,
they'll die.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.871
So they decided to draw
straws on who's gonna

40:38.914 --> 40:41.830
sacrifice themselves so

41:01.110 --> 41:03.591
Minus the mental trauma of
eating their friend, correct?

41:03.635 --> 41:06.246
His name?

41:06.289 --> 41:07.334
Richard Parker.

41:07.377 --> 41:11.077
Again, fiction.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.514
So, like 50 years later,
off the coast of England,

41:13.558 --> 41:15.342
I think,
there's a shipwreck.

41:15.385 --> 41:18.214
And these three guys
get stuck on a lifeboat.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.868
Fiction or
real this time?

41:19.912 --> 41:23.219
Real.

41:23.263 --> 41:25.700
So just like in the book,
they end up capturing

41:25.744 --> 41:28.050
a sea turtle and drinking
its blood to survive,

41:28.094 --> 41:31.532
and just like
in the book,

41:31.576 --> 41:33.795
it's not enough,

41:33.839 --> 41:36.232
so they decided
to draw straws.

41:36.276 --> 41:45.415
♪ Opera singing

41:56.470 --> 41:59.691
The young man who
got the short stick,

41:59.734 --> 42:00.953
Richard.

42:00.996 --> 42:03.433
No.

42:03.477 --> 42:05.174
Parker.

42:05.218 --> 42:07.655
That's why the tiger's name is
Richard Parker in Life of Pi,

42:07.699 --> 42:09.352
because of this
crazy coincidence.

42:09.396 --> 42:13.182
You do realize, though, that the
moral of this story seems to be

42:13.226 --> 42:16.795
that drinking seagull blood
is not gonna be enough.

42:16.838 --> 42:18.100
We're gonna have to
sacrifice one of us

42:18.144 --> 42:20.450
for the good
of the group.

42:28.981 --> 42:32.462
Well,

42:32.506 --> 42:35.335
cheers.

42:50.524 --> 42:55.877
-Sacha: Why did I
suggest this?

42:57.183 --> 42:59.577
OK.

43:04.712 --> 43:08.498
Ugh.

43:08.542 --> 43:10.979
How long would this
actually help us?

43:11.023 --> 43:12.024
I mean,
this can't be safe.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.503
Safe enough,
and I don't know.

43:13.547 --> 43:14.635
Just drink it,
you pussy.

43:14.679 --> 43:15.680
Look, I don't
think I can.

43:15.723 --> 43:16.768
Alright,
give it here.

43:16.811 --> 43:17.856
No,
it's not that bad.

43:17.899 --> 43:18.944
No,
it really is.

43:18.987 --> 43:19.988
Seriously,
if you don't want it.

43:20.032 --> 43:21.120
Stop, stop it.

43:21.163 --> 43:23.165
It's not bad.

43:41.357 --> 43:42.445
What a waste.

43:42.489 --> 43:43.664
Oh God.

43:43.708 --> 43:45.013
Oh God,
that's awful.

43:45.057 --> 43:47.537
I need something to get
this taste out of mouth.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.365
You've got ocean water,
you've got motor oil.

43:49.409 --> 43:50.410
Urine.

43:50.453 --> 43:51.541
You can
still go?

43:51.585 --> 43:52.760
I haven't
for days.

43:52.804 --> 43:53.674
I almost would drink
piss at this point.

43:53.718 --> 43:56.198
Wait.

43:56.242 --> 43:58.200
I'm kidding,
I'm not drinking piss.

43:58.244 --> 43:59.854
I hope you forgot
to throw this out.

43:59.898 --> 44:03.379
And not
motor oil.

44:03.423 --> 44:06.034
From when we
bought the boat.

44:06.078 --> 44:08.689
You couldn't remember that
before the fucking seagull.

44:08.733 --> 44:11.866
I forgot
about it.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.259
Would this
dehydrate me more?

44:13.302 --> 44:15.870
Alcohol while lost at sea
was not in my curriculum.

44:15.914 --> 44:18.743
Fuck it.

44:18.786 --> 44:20.614
Easy tiger,
come on.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.876
Hey, hey,
hey, come on.

44:21.920 --> 44:24.662
Over here,
come to mama.

44:24.705 --> 44:26.228
Oh.

44:28.666 --> 44:32.713
Oh.

44:32.757 --> 44:36.238
I love Scotch,
suddenly.

44:36.282 --> 44:37.326
Hey, where
are you going?

44:37.370 --> 44:38.414
I'll give it,
I'll give.

44:38.458 --> 44:39.502
Hey, hey!

44:39.546 --> 44:40.939
Listen to me.

44:40.982 --> 44:48.468
I'll give it, once you
or you tell me how and when

44:48.511 --> 44:50.165
y'all
started fucking.

44:50.209 --> 44:51.558
Dude, come on,
this is.

44:51.601 --> 44:53.081
Uh uh.

44:53.125 --> 44:55.562
No one gets another drop
until someone tells me.

44:55.605 --> 44:56.955
And what's knowing
gonna do at this point?

44:56.998 --> 44:59.261
I'm not mad anymore,
I swear to God.

44:59.305 --> 45:01.655
I got my Even Steven,
got bigger problems now.

45:01.699 --> 45:06.834
I just
wanna know.

45:09.315 --> 45:11.360
New Years.

45:11.404 --> 45:15.364
Hand it over.

45:24.547 --> 45:26.941
You passed out for
the millionth time,

45:26.985 --> 45:31.685
and Jay and I were up
cleaning for the millionth time,

45:31.729 --> 45:36.037
he knew I was upset,
and it just happened.

45:36.081 --> 45:38.213
I was also
really drunk.

45:38.257 --> 45:42.957
Well don't make it sound
like I took advantage of you.

45:43.001 --> 45:45.655
Does that
make it better?

45:45.699 --> 45:46.787
How
many times?

45:46.831 --> 45:50.008
Just the once,
I swear.

45:50.051 --> 45:54.316
What'd I catch you
guys arguing about?

45:54.360 --> 45:55.404
We.

45:55.448 --> 45:59.147
No, you.

45:59.191 --> 46:01.367
I wanna hear
it from you.

46:06.024 --> 46:08.026
She and I, we.

46:24.042 --> 46:27.001
You know,

46:27.045 --> 46:31.353
when you
dropped those urns,

46:31.397 --> 46:33.399
I was just
sitting there,

46:33.442 --> 46:41.581
staring at them, and thinking,
why aren't I more upset?

46:41.624 --> 46:43.235
That this pile of
shit on the ground is

46:43.278 --> 46:47.935
what's left of
my parents, right?

46:47.979 --> 46:52.722
And I just
didn't care.

46:52.766 --> 46:55.856
There was no
nostalgia, nothing.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.771
I just.

47:06.824 --> 47:09.870
I just thought we could
take off together is all.

47:13.569 --> 47:18.618
But she said
if we did,

47:18.661 --> 47:21.273
you or your dad
would come after us.

47:24.319 --> 47:26.234
That's the truth.

47:57.439 --> 47:59.267
Hey,
who was better?

47:59.311 --> 48:00.268
What?

48:00.312 --> 48:01.313
In bed.

48:01.356 --> 48:02.401
Seriously?

48:02.444 --> 48:03.445
No, I mean it,
who was better?

48:03.489 --> 48:04.925
Dude, you're
just asking for it.

48:04.969 --> 48:07.493
Hey, I'm not mad anymore,
come on, this is cathartic.

48:07.536 --> 48:09.669
Seriously, if we're all
gonna fucking die out here,

48:09.712 --> 48:11.410
then who gives
a fuck, right?

48:11.453 --> 48:13.238
Come on.

48:13.281 --> 48:14.369
Ugh.

48:14.413 --> 48:15.936
Give it.

48:15.980 --> 48:18.460
Alright, but no
fighting, either of you.

48:18.504 --> 48:19.505
This is gonna
be good, huh?

48:19.548 --> 48:20.636
This is stupid.

48:20.680 --> 48:21.681
No, who gives
a shit, come on.

48:21.724 --> 48:22.856
It's funny.

48:22.900 --> 48:23.944
Sorry.

48:23.988 --> 48:26.164
For what?

48:26.207 --> 48:27.252
He's better.

48:27.295 --> 48:29.428
-Yes!
-What?

48:29.471 --> 48:30.472
- It's not important.
-Well it is to me.

48:30.516 --> 48:31.647
Am I bad?

48:31.691 --> 48:32.648
No, no, no.

48:32.692 --> 48:34.737
He's just.

48:34.781 --> 48:36.304
Ha ha.

48:36.348 --> 48:38.959
This is some bullshit,
I'm a disadvantage here,

48:39.003 --> 48:41.831
he knows all your,
all your stuff,

48:41.875 --> 48:43.007
and if I ever
got a chance to.

48:43.050 --> 48:44.095
I said sorry.

48:44.138 --> 48:45.139
If you just told
me what you like.

48:45.183 --> 48:47.272
No, no, no,
it's not that.

48:47.315 --> 48:48.360
Shut up.

48:48.403 --> 48:49.491
And you,
you weren't.

48:49.535 --> 48:50.623
I'll take you to
the desk right now,

48:50.666 --> 48:51.667
and I'll change
your mind right now.

48:51.711 --> 48:53.017
I wouldn't
be able to.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.844
Why the
hell not?

48:54.888 --> 48:56.934
You're,
you're too soft.

48:56.977 --> 48:58.848
Soft?

48:58.892 --> 48:59.980
Soft?

49:00.024 --> 49:01.329
I'm so
glad I asked.

49:01.373 --> 49:04.376
You got your moves from
the softcore channel.

49:04.419 --> 49:05.507
That's enough.

49:05.551 --> 49:06.552
Enough.

49:06.595 --> 49:07.683
You're vanilla.

49:07.727 --> 49:08.771
Vanilla?

49:08.815 --> 49:11.035
Yeah.

49:11.078 --> 49:12.514
Are you
fucking with me?

49:12.558 --> 49:14.690
Very vanilla for someone who
has sex with prostitutes.

49:14.734 --> 49:16.344
One time, that
happened one fucking.

49:16.388 --> 49:20.174
Vanilla goes with everything,
it's a classic.

49:20.218 --> 49:21.915
Everybody likes, it goes
along with everything.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.048
You want mint chocolate chip
when it's a special occasion,

49:24.091 --> 49:26.050
but you don't want to eat
that every fucking day.

49:26.093 --> 49:27.877
Jay, Jay,
vanilla is fine.

49:27.921 --> 49:31.098
A lot of girls
really like vanilla.

49:31.142 --> 49:33.274
Isn't that what everybody wants,
the safe, reliable,

49:33.318 --> 49:34.754
vanilla flavor, put a
little bit of fudge or something

49:34.797 --> 49:36.843
on top
or something.

49:36.886 --> 49:38.540
Shut the
fuck up.

49:38.584 --> 49:41.935
Jay, I cheated on my long-term
boyfriend with his best friend.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.720
Finally it's articulated,
we got it out.

49:44.764 --> 49:46.374
I can guarantee you,
the last thing I was

49:46.418 --> 49:49.899
looking for was
classic, safe vanilla.

49:55.557 --> 49:56.602
I can't
believe this.

49:56.645 --> 49:58.647
I said sorry.

49:58.691 --> 50:02.912
Oh, hey,
gear down big rig.

50:02.956 --> 50:06.394
Fuck it, you know what,
you got a weird sex face.

50:06.438 --> 50:07.569
A what?

50:07.613 --> 50:08.788
You heard me, your
sex face is strange.

50:08.831 --> 50:10.311
It's
fucking weird.

50:10.355 --> 50:12.357
Right? It's like you're
about to sneeze at all times.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.401
What?

50:13.445 --> 50:14.576
It's like.

50:14.620 --> 50:15.664
That's it.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.579
I do not
do that.

50:17.623 --> 50:19.799
Yes you do,
she absolutely does it.

50:19.842 --> 50:23.759
You know what, when you're
on top you sweat so much

50:23.803 --> 50:25.065
it's like I'm
taking a shower.

50:25.109 --> 50:26.240
Ew.

50:26.284 --> 50:27.720
It's not
that bad.

50:27.763 --> 50:30.114
I feel like covering my
face with a towel sometimes,

50:30.157 --> 50:32.072
because there's
just like a monsoon.

50:32.116 --> 50:35.249
of Richard just
raining down upon me.

50:35.293 --> 50:37.773
A monsoon.

50:37.817 --> 50:39.297
Tsunami.

50:39.340 --> 50:41.342
Nasty,
it's nasty.

50:41.386 --> 50:42.430
That's
fucked up, man.

50:42.474 --> 50:45.346
You need to
get that checked.

50:49.829 --> 50:51.874
Vanilla.

50:51.918 --> 50:54.138
Vanilla.

50:54.181 --> 50:55.965
Fuck me.

50:56.009 --> 50:59.447
Fuck.

50:59.491 --> 51:03.147
Careful
with that.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.454
That can't
be good.

51:06.498 --> 51:09.153
Let me see.

51:11.024 --> 51:12.721
OK, go, go,
salt water, go.

51:12.765 --> 51:15.420
No, the salt water
isn't doing shit.

51:15.463 --> 51:16.551
Hand me
the Scotch.

51:16.595 --> 51:17.639
No, no, we're not
wasting it on that,

51:17.683 --> 51:18.727
the salt water
is the same thing.

51:18.771 --> 51:20.381
It's the same thing
as salt water.

51:20.425 --> 51:21.426
Go.

51:21.469 --> 51:22.514
Go.

51:22.557 --> 51:23.602
Go.

51:23.645 --> 51:27.127
Fine.

51:28.346 --> 51:32.176
I think
I'm drunk.

51:35.744 --> 51:37.659
Monsoon Richard.

51:37.703 --> 51:42.099
Ha ha ha.

51:45.711 --> 51:50.542
Hey, true or not, I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

51:50.585 --> 51:52.718
Why would I
lie about that?

51:52.761 --> 51:59.507
I don't know, maybe you feel bad
about the way it all went down.

51:59.551 --> 52:01.596
I don't
feel bad.

52:11.084 --> 52:14.435
Did you kill her,
or did your dad?

52:21.355 --> 52:24.532
I thought we were
putting it all out there.

52:28.928 --> 52:33.367
I already told you,
we didn't do it.

53:29.336 --> 53:31.251
Fuck!

53:31.295 --> 53:32.948
Fucking,
fucking hurts.

53:32.992 --> 53:34.123
It hurts.

53:34.167 --> 53:36.691
Jay!

53:36.735 --> 53:37.953
It's gonna
be alright.

53:37.997 --> 53:39.303
You're probably just
hungry and thirsty dude.

53:39.346 --> 53:40.608
I don't know if it
was the fucking bird

53:40.652 --> 53:42.523
or the Scotch or what,
but it fucking hurts.

53:42.567 --> 53:43.959
Oh shit.

53:44.003 --> 53:45.787
Holy fuck.

53:45.831 --> 53:47.354
That's fucking
bad, isn't it?

53:47.398 --> 53:48.790
Sacha,
what do we do?

53:48.834 --> 53:50.966
We usually treat infections
like this antibiotics.

53:51.010 --> 53:54.143
Well, when we
don't have those?

53:57.146 --> 54:00.672
We gotta stop the infection
from reaching his heart.

54:00.715 --> 54:02.978
You mean we?

54:03.022 --> 54:03.979
No, no, no.

54:04.023 --> 54:05.633
Are
you serious?

54:05.677 --> 54:06.895
I don't know how else to stop
the infection from spreading.

54:06.939 --> 54:10.682
No, no, no, we don't
even have any knives.

54:10.725 --> 54:11.813
Sacha, stop!

54:11.857 --> 54:13.293
He's fucking
dying, Richard.

54:13.337 --> 54:16.296
Look, I'm right here, I'm
not fucking dying, I'm good.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.645
Couldn't this kill
him too, I mean,

54:17.689 --> 54:19.778
when the new cut
gets infected?

54:19.821 --> 54:22.824
I know you two can hear me,
look, I'm fine, I swear.

54:22.868 --> 54:25.871
Look, look,
look, look.

54:30.310 --> 54:35.315
Ahhh.

54:37.883 --> 54:42.191
Oh fuck, it feels like there's
ants crawling in my veins.

54:42.235 --> 54:44.324
Jay, Jay,
Jay, Jay.

54:44.368 --> 54:45.978
If we don't
do this,

54:46.021 --> 54:54.682
if this reaches your heart or
your brain, you're dead, 100%.

54:54.726 --> 54:57.032
Be brave.

55:14.354 --> 55:15.355
Richard,
give me your belt.

55:15.399 --> 55:16.487
What did
he say?

55:16.530 --> 55:17.531
Nothing,
just give me your belt.

55:17.575 --> 55:18.706
What did
he say?

55:18.750 --> 55:19.707
Just fucking
help me.

55:31.545 --> 55:34.243
Ready?

55:39.031 --> 55:40.293
Wait!

55:44.819 --> 55:47.387
OK, now
you can go.

55:47.431 --> 55:48.388
Seriously?

55:48.432 --> 55:49.911
Look,
I'm fucking thirsty.

55:49.955 --> 55:52.479
His blood
could be toxic.

55:52.523 --> 55:54.089
I don't fucking
know any more.

55:56.004 --> 55:57.571
Oh my God.

56:01.445 --> 56:03.098
Richard!

56:03.142 --> 56:05.623
Oh, fuck!

56:10.454 --> 56:12.107
Fuck off dude!

56:12.151 --> 56:13.282
Richard, where's
the God damn tape?

56:13.326 --> 56:14.414
I don't know.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.808
Fuck off.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.785
That was a terrible
fucking idea.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.529
Hey.

56:42.573 --> 56:44.183
Can I have some?

56:44.226 --> 56:46.794
I told you.

56:48.579 --> 56:51.930
Idiot.

56:51.973 --> 56:53.975
Come on!

56:56.978 --> 57:05.987
♪ Where I go,
I fall back asleep ♪

57:13.517 --> 57:22.526
♪ Why call in sick
if everyone, not me ♪

57:29.924 --> 57:39.020
♪ Old strangers come
in and out discreet ♪

57:48.552 --> 57:49.944
Fuck.

57:49.988 --> 57:52.599
I don't know, I still
can't figure this shit out.

57:52.643 --> 57:54.558
I think he
has sepsis.

57:54.601 --> 57:56.473
What?

57:56.516 --> 58:02.696
Blood poisoning.

58:02.740 --> 58:06.526
Hey,
if he dies,

58:06.570 --> 58:09.224
can we?

58:09.268 --> 58:11.400
What?

58:11.444 --> 58:13.968
What?

58:14.012 --> 58:16.188
Is he
edible?

58:16.231 --> 58:17.842
No.

58:17.885 --> 58:19.583
No, as in he's
not edible, or no?

58:19.626 --> 58:21.498
No, as in we're
not eating anybody.

58:21.541 --> 58:23.500
Sacha,
what the fuck?

58:23.543 --> 58:29.593
I can raise one of the
straws so you don't pick it.

58:29.636 --> 58:31.203
You two
deserve each other.

58:31.246 --> 58:32.900
What?

58:32.944 --> 58:35.903
Do you want to know what he
whispered to me last night?

58:35.947 --> 58:37.209
He asked me if
I thought about

58:37.252 --> 58:41.561
using the glass shard
on you instead of him.

59:54.939 --> 59:58.595
Fuck!

59:58.638 --> 01:00:00.335
It's OK.

01:00:00.379 --> 01:00:02.337
You're gonna
be alright.

01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:13.827
Deep breaths, OK.

01:00:13.871 --> 01:00:16.308
Deep breaths.

01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:18.179
Just breathe.

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:20.747
Yeah, OK.

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:25.012
OK.

01:00:25.056 --> 01:00:28.668
You're not being honest
with me, are you?

01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:32.585
What?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.675
Richard Parker.

01:00:38.983 --> 01:00:44.162
Don't you think it's
time we draw straws?

01:00:44.205 --> 01:00:48.732
I'm on my way out if
something doesn't change soon.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:50.037
If I don't eat or
drink something soon,

01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:53.040
I'm gonna
die, right?

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.694
It's me
you're gonna eat.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.000
No, no,
that won't be a problem.

01:00:56.043 --> 01:00:57.697
I heard that,
you fuck.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.568
I also heard what
you said last night.

01:00:59.612 --> 01:01:01.745
You're the one dying,
why don't you be a man

01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:03.964
for once and
volunteer yourself.

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:06.575
We wouldn't even be here right
now if it wasn't for you.

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:08.142
Oh, whatever crush
you're harboring,

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.710
let it go dude,
it's fucking embarrassing.

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:11.972
No, you're
embarrassing.

01:01:12.016 --> 01:01:13.582
You had your shot man,
she didn't pick you.

01:01:13.626 --> 01:01:16.455
No, but I wouldn't fuck
around on her, would I?

01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:18.109
You hear
that Sacha?

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:21.982
Even after what happened last
year, he still cheats on you.

01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:25.986
You're a
fucking idiot.

01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:27.640
I'm the idiot?

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.120
All of that shit
you pulled that year,

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:30.599
and you still couldn't
learn your fucking lesson.

01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:31.731
Just tell her
you love her, huh.

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:32.906
I would do
anything for her.

01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:36.083
Well you most certainly
did do anything.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.173
You're so chivalrous,
why don't you tell her

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:42.873
what you
did to my ex.

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.222
What?

01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:47.747
Wait, that can't
be right, can it?

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:51.446
You're the
mistreated nice guy.

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:53.057
Fuck is
going on, guys?

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.105
You hate me, you're scared of
me for what you think I did.

01:01:58.149 --> 01:02:01.108
Way to run right into
the real psycho's arms.

01:02:07.898 --> 01:02:10.335
Jay?

01:02:15.557 --> 01:02:16.645
Sacha.

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:19.344
Sacha, I.

01:02:21.389 --> 01:02:26.133
Look, I knew if
you left it was over.

01:02:26.177 --> 01:02:28.570
The three of us wouldn't hang
out, and you would be gone.

01:02:28.614 --> 01:02:31.182
You wouldn't be
around anymore.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.757
I was gonna try and convince
her to get rid of the baby,

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.152
but she,

01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:47.851
she wouldn't
listen, OK?

01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:52.507
It was
an accident.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:58.165
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:58.209 --> 01:02:59.297
No, no.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.342
I was just trying
to keep us together.

01:03:01.386 --> 01:03:03.040
But I'm the
asshole, right?

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.302
He's the
gentleman?

01:03:04.345 --> 01:03:05.912
You just use us,
that's all you do.

01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:07.566
I spend all my
money on you guys.

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:10.047
You'd never leave your mom's
basement if it wasn't for me.

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:11.700
You do all that
shit for you.

01:03:11.744 --> 01:03:13.224
Not us.

01:03:13.267 --> 01:03:18.185
So you can have a good fucking
time, you selfish prick.

01:03:18.229 --> 01:03:21.362
I have nothing.

01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:25.018
My family
left me nothing.

01:03:25.062 --> 01:03:31.633
I never asked you for
anything, you never offered.

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:39.380
You have no idea what it's
like to work for everything.

01:03:50.174 --> 01:03:52.741
I think we
should draw straws.

01:04:45.533 --> 01:04:48.667
OK.

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:54.673
Before we start,
everyone clear on the rules?

01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:10.297
No begging.

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:12.952
No pleading.

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:19.480
This is so the other two
can continue to live.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:31.144
You first.

01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:41.938
Pick.

01:05:55.212 --> 01:05:58.084
Alright Jay.

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:07.615
Fuck you.

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:29.202
Fucking
Richard Parker.

01:06:29.246 --> 01:06:31.813
Wait, dude.

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:32.901
We can't
let her do this.

01:06:32.945 --> 01:06:33.990
We said
no pleading.

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:36.166
You're not the one
who's pleading.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:41.301
You're just gonna
let her do this?

01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:45.784
Fucking off yourself
if you're so offended.

01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:50.049
I didn't
think so.

01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:03.062
Can you do
it yourself?

01:07:17.337 --> 01:07:18.730
OK.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:21.646
OK.

01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:32.744
We'll draw straws
again to see who has to

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:36.748
take her out.

01:07:46.018 --> 01:07:47.063
I'll do it.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:53.286
What?

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:57.638
You get to
pick this time.

01:07:57.682 --> 01:08:00.250
Even Steven.

01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:08.910
Pick Rich.

01:08:08.954 --> 01:08:11.739
Pick.

01:08:27.929 --> 01:08:29.017
Hmm.

01:08:46.904 --> 01:08:50.517
You always have to
come up even, don't you?

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:06.098
I don't want
to do this.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.361
Just get it
over with.

01:09:13.975 --> 01:09:15.063
No.

01:09:15.107 --> 01:09:16.108
This is what
we said we'd do.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:17.544
No.

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:26.292
You fuck.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.827
We had
a deal.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:59.238
Hey.

01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:08.769
You OK?

01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:18.257
Oh.

01:10:21.347 --> 01:10:23.784
You hungry?

01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:32.140
Come on.

01:10:49.854 --> 01:10:52.857
Stay here.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:09.482
I found this when I was
looking for the golf club.

01:11:09.526 --> 01:11:10.744
I need her
help finding it.

01:11:10.788 --> 01:11:13.312
He doesn't need shit,
you're staying here.

01:11:24.236 --> 01:11:25.498
Here, sit.

01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:27.500
Sit.

01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:34.551
Check this out.

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:40.687
Excuse me.

01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.530
The fuse box
is in there.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:06.234
I pulled
the ignition.

01:12:06.278 --> 01:12:09.542
This little guy is why
the boat wouldn't start.

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:16.854
It gave us a chance
to get rid of him.

01:12:16.897 --> 01:12:19.683
For the
lie detector.

01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:24.340
You were
so good.

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:28.256
Spirit of God and that Richard
Parker shit, such a good idea.

01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:32.957
Just.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.090
Just shitty
luck with my arm.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:39.006
And you pulling
the short straw.

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:41.922
But didn't that just
show how little he cared?

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:44.577
How he was willing
to let you die?

01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:55.762
None of that
matters anymore.

01:12:55.806 --> 01:12:58.417
We can run
away now.

01:12:58.461 --> 01:13:00.767
Together.

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:06.599
You
said that.

01:13:06.643 --> 01:13:11.256
You said that we're
gonna run away together.

01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:15.782
You said that we could get
the cash in his closet,

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:19.960
and get
out of here.

01:13:20.004 --> 01:13:22.615
You
said that.

01:13:25.879 --> 01:13:27.881
I.

01:13:27.925 --> 01:13:30.797
I thought
I said

01:13:30.841 --> 01:13:33.321
you could
take the cash.

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:43.114
You.

01:13:43.157 --> 01:13:46.291
You aren't
gonna come?

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:51.992
I.

01:13:59.391 --> 01:14:04.004
Of course
I am.

01:14:04.048 --> 01:14:06.006
Of course.

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:09.749
OK, now.

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:11.185
Eat.

01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:16.495
I'll get us home as
soon as possible.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:19.542
We'll just have to
say we found the fuse

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:23.110
after we
drew straws,

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:25.330
OK?

01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:28.202
OK.

01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:45.785
Don't worry,

01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:48.396
I'll get
us home.

01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:10.653
You ready?

01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:33.937
Jesus, you do
have a good punch.

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.939
You know
someone once told me,

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:39.159
the sea finds out
everything you've done wrong,

01:16:39.203 --> 01:16:42.336
so between his bad luck
name and his now public sins,

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.512
I think it's
fair to say

01:16:44.556 --> 01:16:46.602
Jonah had
this coming.

01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:13.166
And while we still don't
know the reason behind the

01:18:13.210 --> 01:18:17.736
red headed superstition, we do
know that, for whatever reason,

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.738
it definitely
holds true.

01:18:44.589 --> 01:18:47.461
Fuck.

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:31.685
Moving on.

01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:35.863
Perfect, print it,
let's go, alright.
