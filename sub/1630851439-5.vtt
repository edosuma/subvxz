WEBVTT

01:29.548 --> 01:32.843
Of all the stories
my mother used to tell me at bedtime,

01:32.926 --> 01:35.304
the black hole frightened me the most.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.475
It wasn't the darkness that scared me.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.145
I was comfortable in darkness.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.150
It was the idea of an event horizon.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.863
Venture into that horizon,

01:52.946 --> 01:56.283
and the gravitational pull
prevents you from turning back.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.746
Escape becomes impossible.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.223
Gaal. Time for morning rites.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.287
We speak the words.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.706
And the words make us seen.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.002
Welcome forth this child among you,

02:49.920 --> 02:55.008
that he should be blessed,
loved and cherished,

02:56.009 --> 02:58.262
heard and seen,

02:58.846 --> 03:01.181
one with the Sleeper's words.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.599
Upon awakening.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.601
Upon awakening.

03:05.102 --> 03:10.274
Seer Dominie, we must check the university
for forbidden activity.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.404
Acolyte Dornick.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.409
Seer Dominie said there were lights
in the windows last night.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.286
But the university's abandoned.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.037
Look.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.727
Instructor Sorn?

04:32.981 --> 04:33.982
Gaal?

04:34.733 --> 04:37.528
I heard you had become an acolyte.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.697
You look like your father now.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.701
So pious. Hunting for heretics.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.830
All the nights I spent
at your parents' table, talking

04:49.331 --> 04:51.708
while you fell asleep
in your mother's arms.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.045
They seem a million years away now.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.673
Your parents took
another path, didn't they?

04:59.132 --> 05:02.427
As did you. Quite another path.

05:03.053 --> 05:07.724
You can't be here, Mr. Sorn.
The Seers condemned this building.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.685
Heretical, right?

05:10.644 --> 05:14.398
All analytic learning goes against
the Faith of the Awakening.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.609
What do you deem it, Gaal?
You always had a sharp mind.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.779
Stop. Just drop the books and go.

05:21.905 --> 05:25.409
If the Seers find out you're here,
they'll kill you.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.535
Yes.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.454
When a planet wants you dead, you die.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.373
Run.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.458
They're just words on a page.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.835
Are they?

05:35.711 --> 05:37.838
Kalle's Book of Folding.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.425
She dedicated
her entire life to writing it.

05:42.968 --> 05:43.969
Chaos theory.

05:44.553 --> 05:48.640
Furthering knowledge
is the most noble work of humankind, Gaal.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.309
Remember that.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.644
Take it.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.482
I'll hold it for you.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.071
This "Cleanse" will pass, Gaal.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.908
The tides that rise will ebb.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.994
Not in our lifetime, but someday.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.456
All things have a cycle.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.918
After destruction, rebirth.

06:16.710 --> 06:21.006
Knowledge gives us ways to survive
the destruction till the rebirth arrives.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.550
-The floods--
-Are a warning from the Sleeper,

06:24.259 --> 06:28.597
a challenge we must overcome
in order to prove worthy of his Awakening.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.934
No. And you know it. No.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.143
Gaal?

06:37.064 --> 06:40.108
You need to leave. Please.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.986
We overmined the volcanic vents.

06:43.487 --> 06:47.533
We melted the ice caps. We did this.
Not your slumbering god.

06:47.616 --> 06:48.951
There is no "we."

06:49.451 --> 06:52.704
I'm not on your side.
I'm not a kindred soul.

06:55.582 --> 07:00.712
Are you willing to test that conviction
against Kalle's numbers?

07:02.256 --> 07:03.257
There.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.262
It's Dr. Sorn.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.949
Cleanse us, benevolent Sleeper,

08:11.033 --> 08:15.746
that we might be one with your words
and abide in your Dream.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.290
Upon awakening.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.626
Upon awakening.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.339
Acolyte Dornick.

08:26.215 --> 08:28.592
The Sleeper is watching.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.780
For this, he will be cleansed.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.761
This will not stop the sea from rising…

09:13.637 --> 09:16.306
or the algae blooms from dying.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.767
Only knowledge can do that.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.943
Ceremony at 6:00.
You'll be assisting Seer Dominie.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.696
I can't go this eventide.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.740
I gotta venture further out to find green.

11:39.324 --> 11:43.829
Water seems like it's getting warmer now.
Lots of dead algae.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.080
It's monsoon season.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.916
Did Dominie tell you
when you'd be advancing to votary?

11:48.417 --> 11:51.670
She trusts you more and more, Gaal.
I can see it.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.798
Votary comes with
a substantial honorarium, doesn't it?

11:55.924 --> 11:59.344
-Two hundred chitons a quarter.
-That will help.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.888
It won't be enough.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.016
The high floods are coming.

12:04.683 --> 12:06.935
Who are you to question
the Sleeper's word?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.062
The floods are coming.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.398
People are gonna die
unless everything is raised--

12:11.481 --> 12:12.482
Enough.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.360
Speak your devotions.

12:19.990 --> 12:22.242
Bless and be seen, O Sleeper.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.995
Thankful for your wisdom and dreams.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.400
I wanna send a tight-beam message.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.655
I was told you could help.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.075
No. Seers don't brook
any off-world contact,

13:03.700 --> 13:05.869
-unless it's church business.
-I'll pay.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.333
Fifty chitons.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.798
-Where you wanna tight-beam?
-Trantor. Streeling University.

13:39.278 --> 13:43.240
The Seers are saying someone on Synnax
has entered an imperial math competition.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.284
You have to stop this, Gaal.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.828
You're putting us all at risk
by pursuing this.

13:47.911 --> 13:48.912
Let it go.

15:06.532 --> 15:10.744
Greetings, Ms. Dornick.
My name is Hari Seldon.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.872
I am a professor
at Streeling University, on Trantor.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.251
I would like to offer you
my congratulations

15:17.334 --> 15:21.880
on your novel resolution
to the Abraxas Conjecture.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.258
Since you've published your solution,

15:24.341 --> 15:27.302
several circles within academia
have seen fit to cast doubt

15:27.386 --> 15:28.637
upon your achievement.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.807
The Conjecture has stood
for centuries, after all,

15:31.890 --> 15:33.767
confounding the greatest minds.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.813
I suppose the fact that the answer
has come from someone on Synnax,

15:38.397 --> 15:40.190
and a young woman at that,

15:40.274 --> 15:43.026
has made it all the harder
for them to accept.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.446
But the beauty of math is that it is pure.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.575
I have studied your solution,

15:50.534 --> 15:55.080
and I would like to offer you my support
by validating your proof.

15:55.664 --> 16:01.086
It is ingenious, elegant and true.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.380
Bravo, Ms. Dornick.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.217
I expect the doubting will cease soon.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.720
You've a remarkable mind.

16:10.679 --> 16:14.933
I would consider it a privilege
if you would come to Trantor as my guest.

16:15.434 --> 16:18.312
You could walk my students
through your solution.

16:18.395 --> 16:21.273
I know they'd be fascinated
to learn how you achieved it.

16:22.232 --> 16:26.111
Undoubtedly, you'll hear
through official channels soon enough.

16:26.195 --> 16:30.908
But, well, I'm rather hoping
you'll accept my invitation first.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.749
Thank you, Sleeper. Thank you.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.633
Someone from our village
communicating with Trantor?

16:47.716 --> 16:49.218
-It's disgraceful.
-They have to be punished.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.469
Gaal.

16:52.846 --> 16:53.847
Gaal.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.435
It's coming.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.730
Even raising everything
ten-rod won't save us.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.899
The math is undeniable.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.151
There'll be hurricane winds,
massive flooding--

17:06.234 --> 17:08.487
Are these the Sleeper's words
speaking through you?

17:08.569 --> 17:09.570
No.

17:10.781 --> 17:11.823
It's math.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.327
I solved the proof.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.372
I'm the one the Seers are looking for.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.002
Hari Seldon invited me to Trantor.
Come with me.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.295
Trantor?

17:26.547 --> 17:27.839
The machine world?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.760
I'd rather my daughter die.

17:47.860 --> 17:51.196
As a child,
I had nightmares of black holes.

17:54.157 --> 17:59.788
I used to imagine what it would be like,
drifting towards something miraculous,

18:00.789 --> 18:05.460
bearing witness to something
most minds could never even comprehend,

18:07.296 --> 18:12.885
then realizing too late that
you had reached the point of no return.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.598
What have you done?

18:53.175 --> 18:56.261
Even waking up, the terror continued…

19:01.642 --> 19:04.811
…like an echo, whispering…

19:29.628 --> 19:34.716
diminishing in volume forever,
but never quite dying out.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.488
Hello?

20:08.333 --> 20:09.543
Hari?

20:18.177 --> 20:20.262
Hello? Is anyone there?

20:20.345 --> 20:21.555
Hello?

20:25.267 --> 20:26.435
Please. Please.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.061
Is anyone there?

20:28.145 --> 20:29.396
Please. Please.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.741
Let me--

20:40.824 --> 20:44.703
Let me out of here! Let me out!

20:49.499 --> 20:51.251
Let me out!

20:51.752 --> 20:53.712
Please. Let me out. Let me out!

20:53.795 --> 20:55.714
Help!

20:55.797 --> 20:57.508
Please.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.759
Please.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.636
No!

21:14.691 --> 21:17.194
Uploading cryo-session data.

21:17.277 --> 21:20.322
Initiating Raych Foss arrival protocol.

21:33.168 --> 21:34.378
Hello?

22:23.468 --> 22:24.720
Hello?

22:24.803 --> 22:26.763
Command not recognized.

22:27.973 --> 22:29.224
What is this place?

22:29.308 --> 22:31.810
Identification required.

22:32.561 --> 22:34.688
This is Gaal Dornick.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.940
Where am I? What is this ship?

22:38.233 --> 22:40.819
Who's the captain?
Where is everyone?

22:43.947 --> 22:45.282
Just me?

22:52.915 --> 22:54.041
Okay.

22:55.209 --> 22:59.129
I need to send a message
to Lewis Pirenne.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.006
Hail the Deliverance.

23:01.089 --> 23:06.637
The Deliverance was decommissioned
on 12/11/12,072 E.I.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.765
It can't be. It's still in mid-flight.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.311
12,072…

23:15.812 --> 23:17.356
What year is it?

23:18.023 --> 23:19.525
How long was I asleep?

23:20.108 --> 23:23.487
12,102 Era Imperial.

23:23.570 --> 23:29.076
Your cryo-session duration
was 34 years, 223 days.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.436
What the hell are they doing?

23:56.520 --> 23:59.022
Spectral cloaking.
They're camouflaging it.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.149
But we already know it's here.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.575
They're not hiding it from us.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.476
Watchmen, status?

24:36.560 --> 24:38.562
They're firing at the western fence.

24:40.564 --> 24:42.482
I count 50 here in the east.

24:43.984 --> 24:46.195
I count at least that to the west.

24:46.778 --> 24:49.364
Hold your ground.
They're just trying to rattle you.

24:49.448 --> 24:50.490
Yes, Warden.

24:51.742 --> 24:54.328
-Here, here, here.
-I'm a scientist.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.997
Look, if you don't take that,
you'll be a dead scientist.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.081
Your choice.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.223
Your Grand Huntress is a liar.

25:15.265 --> 25:18.810
Everything she feels,
it's all curdled inside her.

25:18.894 --> 25:22.439
She comes to destroy, no matter the cost.

25:22.940 --> 25:24.983
You underestimate the rest of us, Warden.

25:28.028 --> 25:30.239
We all bear Anacreon's scars.

25:30.948 --> 25:31.949
Phara's different.

25:32.533 --> 25:36.703
Her game is over.
No next move, only a last one.

25:36.787 --> 25:40.499
You may have us outgunned,
but you're desperate.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.583
Scared.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.961
And desperate people make mistakes.

25:57.099 --> 25:58.433
Is that…

25:58.517 --> 26:00.060
An imperial ship jumping in.

26:08.569 --> 26:10.988
I'll be damned.
They actually showed up.

26:19.496 --> 26:22.207
There's an imperial ship orbiting
the planet. Just stand by.

26:23.792 --> 26:27.379
I knew the Empire would come for us.
I'm sure Hari did as well.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.302
Do you think they're gonna save us?

26:37.055 --> 26:39.349
-Status?
-Approaching Terminus, Commander.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.310
Pull up a wide-spectrum planetary scan.

26:41.393 --> 26:43.604
I want population, power plants, weapons.

26:44.188 --> 26:47.191
Primary power source is a geothermal cell
ten klicks north.

26:47.274 --> 26:50.152
City's protected by a standard
imperial-issue energy barrier--

26:50.235 --> 26:51.778
Commander,
there's something you should see.

26:51.862 --> 26:54.740
There's three transport ships near that
geothermal cell, non-imperial make.

26:55.324 --> 26:56.491
Anacreon corvettes.

26:57.451 --> 26:59.369
Keep aiming for geosync
over Terminus City,

26:59.453 --> 27:02.122
but be ready to divert
to a landing trajectory.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.166
-Open up encrypted channels.
-We can't, sir.

27:04.249 --> 27:07.085
Not enough bandwidth, since we don't have
the communications buoy for relay.

27:07.169 --> 27:10.506
Try a public frequency then.
Let's ring their bell. Say hello.

27:16.637 --> 27:19.598
Terminus City and Foundation Director
Lewis Pirenne.

27:19.681 --> 27:22.809
This is Commander Kray Dorwin
of the imperial vessel Aegis.

27:22.893 --> 27:24.102
Immediate report, please.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.521
I'm here. I'm here.

27:25.604 --> 27:28.857
Lewis Pirenne, Commander.
Director of the Foundation.

27:29.441 --> 27:31.151
We formally request the Empire's aid.

27:31.235 --> 27:32.569
The Empire will grant you aid.

27:33.153 --> 27:35.239
However, we require information first.

27:35.322 --> 27:37.074
I'd like to speak
to your minister of defense.

27:37.157 --> 27:41.995
We are a small outpost, Commander.
We have no armed forces.

27:42.079 --> 27:43.830
A director of intelligence then?

27:46.291 --> 27:49.169
Who knows the movements
of the Anacreon troops?

27:49.253 --> 27:50.671
That'd be me, Commander.

27:51.213 --> 27:53.507
Salvor Hardin. Warden of Terminus.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.093
Commander, you should know
that the Anacreon kingdom

27:56.176 --> 27:58.512
has confessed to destroying
the comms buoy

27:58.595 --> 28:01.223
in the hopes that it would trigger
an imperial response.

28:01.306 --> 28:04.393
I strongly advise you stay clear until
we can determine why they want you here.

28:04.476 --> 28:06.895
Confessed? Who spoke for them?

28:06.979 --> 28:09.314
We have their leader
in custody, Commander.

28:09.398 --> 28:12.109
Phara Keaen. Their Grand Huntress.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.236
Have her brought to the tower.
I wanna lay eyes on her.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.655
-Of course, Commander.
-That's a mistake, sir.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.949
Phara's been angling for the tower--

28:19.032 --> 28:20.617
Hello?

28:20.701 --> 28:22.953
-Hello?
-They're jamming our local network.

28:24.037 --> 28:27.749
Ten minutes, Director.
Then I want this Huntress in front of me.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.628
He thinks we're a planet
of simpleminded rustics.

28:31.712 --> 28:33.881
Who cares what he thinks?
We shouldn't move her.

28:33.964 --> 28:38.010
Your daughter may be willing to defy
the Empire based on speculations, Mari,

28:38.093 --> 28:39.178
but I am not.

28:39.261 --> 28:41.305
Why wait until now to kill comms?

28:42.055 --> 28:44.975
They were listening in.
They know we're about to move her.

28:55.903 --> 28:57.613
The field relays are in the tower.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.743
Get everyone back to the city.
I need to get back to the brig.

29:02.826 --> 29:03.911
Why?

29:03.994 --> 29:05.537
Phara's taking down the fence.

29:24.765 --> 29:26.475
I need to send a communication.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.101
Authorization required.

29:28.185 --> 29:29.937
I need to send a message.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.648
-Authorization required.
-Just authorize me!

29:32.731 --> 29:34.691
Command not recognized.

29:35.692 --> 29:36.944
Set course for Terminus.

29:37.027 --> 29:38.529
Authorization required.

29:40.739 --> 29:41.907
Think.

29:41.990 --> 29:43.617
Think, think, think, think.

29:45.869 --> 29:46.954
Okay.

29:49.915 --> 29:52.626
Am I authorized to run a search?

29:53.210 --> 29:56.380
"Anything in the imperial public record."
Okay.

29:56.964 --> 29:59.216
Search population of Terminus.

30:02.386 --> 30:03.512
They made it.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.474
Okay.

30:10.269 --> 30:11.728
Okay.

30:17.067 --> 30:20.946
Search Hari Seldon death.

30:25.617 --> 30:28.787
Good evening. It is with a heavy heart
that I record this message.

30:28.871 --> 30:34.334
On the 8th of the 8th,
12,068 the Era Imperial,

30:34.418 --> 30:35.711
Hari Seldon was--

30:38.881 --> 30:40.299
Hari Seldon was murdered.

30:40.382 --> 30:42.426
He died from fatal stab wounds

30:42.509 --> 30:45.596
administered by his foster son,
Raych Foss,

30:45.679 --> 30:48.015
and Foss's accomplice, Gaal Dornick.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.225
No. No.

30:50.309 --> 30:53.270
As per Seldon's mortality directive,

30:53.353 --> 30:55.981
his body will be ejected
from this spacecraft

30:57.316 --> 30:59.193
in a casket he himself designed.

31:02.821 --> 31:05.908
In accordance with
the project's line of succession,

31:06.491 --> 31:11.872
it falls to me as senior councilman
to assume command of the Foundation.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.207
I believe with all my heart

31:13.290 --> 31:17.377
that every citizen upon this ship
was chosen for a reason.

31:17.461 --> 31:21.340
We will preserve and build upon
Hari Seldon's legacy.

31:22.174 --> 31:26.011
We will devote our lives
to protecting the Empire

31:27.221 --> 31:30.974
and all its citizens from the coming fall.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.393
The Plan continues.

31:35.354 --> 31:36.855
May the light never dim.

31:39.066 --> 31:41.360
Stop. Stop!

31:55.082 --> 31:56.250
Search…

31:57.209 --> 31:58.585
Raych Foss.

31:59.586 --> 32:00.712
Warning.

32:00.796 --> 32:03.590
Designate Hari Seldon's
life functions have ceased.

32:06.468 --> 32:09.137
Raych, why?

32:11.306 --> 32:12.391
Was it…

32:13.600 --> 32:14.601
premeditated?

32:16.144 --> 32:19.273
We know you were arguing
with Dr. Seldon the night of his death.

32:19.356 --> 32:23.068
You were questioning his forecasts
just before,

32:24.152 --> 32:26.488
implying that they were unstable.

32:27.531 --> 32:29.700
For God's sake, say something!

32:30.784 --> 32:32.327
The man loved you like a son.

32:33.078 --> 32:36.665
He lifted you out of the heat sinks.
He saved you…

32:38.667 --> 32:40.460
as he would have saved us all.

32:41.461 --> 32:43.630
What could possibly
have possessed you to--

32:46.008 --> 32:47.676
Did Gaal Dornick put you up to it?

32:47.759 --> 32:50.429
She had nothing to do with this.
It was all me.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.264
No. You don't have to protect her.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.641
It was me. I did what I had to do.

32:54.725 --> 32:57.311
Why? Speak!

32:57.978 --> 33:00.355
Do you even understand
what it is you've done?

33:00.439 --> 33:01.815
I understand more than you.

33:01.899 --> 33:06.361
Then you admit that of your own free will

33:06.445 --> 33:08.739
and with full knowledge of your actions,

33:08.822 --> 33:11.408
you murdered Hari Seldon?

33:12.326 --> 33:14.244
-No. No.
-You understand what happens next.

33:24.421 --> 33:25.672
Search…

33:26.548 --> 33:27.716
Raych Foss…

33:28.926 --> 33:30.260
execution.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.401
Any final words?

33:47.611 --> 33:49.780
I know it's hard.

33:51.865 --> 33:54.493
I know what I've done seems
incomprehensible.

33:55.994 --> 33:58.288
But you can't lose faith in the Plan.

33:59.498 --> 34:00.499
Ever.

34:01.375 --> 34:04.253
You have the gall to tell us
not to lose faith?

34:09.007 --> 34:10.801
You can still solve a puzzle…

34:14.221 --> 34:15.764
even with a piece missing.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.018
I--

34:24.273 --> 34:25.274
I--

35:17.034 --> 35:18.035
Shit.

35:28.253 --> 35:30.380
-Keep moving.
-I feel sick.

35:32.466 --> 35:33.634
I need a minute.

35:33.717 --> 35:35.886
I don't think we should stop here.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.394
-What is she doing?
-What's happened?

35:47.773 --> 35:50.108
You should have trusted your warden.

35:51.652 --> 35:52.945
What is that?

36:14.424 --> 36:15.425
Poly, Laylo.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.803
You kids get back
to the city now, you hear?

36:18.387 --> 36:19.513
Do as I say!

37:30.083 --> 37:32.127
All things have a cycle.

37:32.211 --> 37:34.129
After destruction, rebirth.

37:35.088 --> 37:39.676
Knowledge gives us ways to survive
the destruction until the rebirth arrives.

37:55.442 --> 37:59.530
Computer, did the ship just conduct
a trajectory correction maneuver?

37:59.613 --> 38:02.616
-Are we beginning an orbital insertion?
-Affirmative.

38:02.699 --> 38:04.034
So we're slowing down.

38:05.160 --> 38:07.454
Which means
we're approaching a destination.

38:08.247 --> 38:09.998
Identify our destination.

38:10.082 --> 38:11.875
Authorization required.

38:20.801 --> 38:23.053
Am I authorized to see a star chart?

38:27.766 --> 38:30.143
How about inertial reference points?

38:30.227 --> 38:32.729
Can you show me
all celestial sphere locations

38:32.813 --> 38:34.606
of all quasars in direct line of sight?

38:36.441 --> 38:38.569
Highlight the Cloverleaf Quasar.

38:41.321 --> 38:43.156
Simple optical navigation.

38:43.240 --> 38:49.663
Okay, do we have direct line of sight to
Swen-Yen 214, Austus 11, Hudson 8,053?

38:49.746 --> 38:51.540
-Affirmative.
-Show them.

38:54.042 --> 38:57.421
Now show me the angular separation
of the Cloverleaf and these three stars.

38:59.214 --> 39:03.802
Okay, display a cone
with a 23.5-degree half-angle.

39:03.886 --> 39:05.679
Also, display the central axis.

39:05.762 --> 39:10.142
Computer, can you trace out the surface
of possible positions of the apex?

39:10.684 --> 39:13.187
Another cone? Thirty degrees half-angle.

39:14.605 --> 39:18.150
And give me a third cone,
half-angle of 62 degrees.

39:25.365 --> 39:26.366
We're right here.

39:27.701 --> 39:31.246
Which puts us in the Argo Sector,
near the Yu Ling Stream.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.582
Now, what direction are we heading in?

39:33.665 --> 39:35.083
Authorization required.

39:36.168 --> 39:38.921
Do I have access to stellar spectra?

39:39.004 --> 39:40.923
-Affirmative.
-Yes. Okay.

39:41.006 --> 39:44.927
Show me the current
and nominal spectra for Swen-Yen 214,

39:45.010 --> 39:47.554
Austus 11, Hudson 8,053.

39:48.472 --> 39:50.098
Relativistic Doppler shift.

39:50.807 --> 39:53.101
I'm going to outsmart you,
you stupid ship.

40:02.361 --> 40:03.612
Okay.

40:04.488 --> 40:09.076
Display a vector,
orientation in the galactic frame,

40:09.159 --> 40:14.498
bearing 289 degrees,
elevation minus 5.3 degrees.

40:15.666 --> 40:16.667
There!

40:17.543 --> 40:18.919
Is that our current velocity?

40:19.002 --> 40:21.004
Authorization required.

40:21.088 --> 40:23.715
Is the vector parallel
to the long axis of the Raven?

40:23.799 --> 40:25.092
Negative.

40:25.175 --> 40:28.637
Is the vector antiparallel
to the long axis of the Raven?

40:28.720 --> 40:29.805
Affirmative.

40:30.931 --> 40:35.811
Okay. So that last course correction
flipped the ship.

40:37.354 --> 40:38.564
We're slowing down.

40:42.484 --> 40:44.152
And our final destination…

40:46.947 --> 40:49.449
is here.

40:54.955 --> 40:59.710
Computer, is that an actual window
or a virtual view screen?

40:59.793 --> 41:01.044
A view screen.

41:06.049 --> 41:07.968
Are you displaying
all possible wavelengths

41:08.051 --> 41:10.179
that might reveal stars
or planets in the region?

41:10.262 --> 41:11.388
Negative.

41:11.972 --> 41:14.558
-So you're censoring what I'm seeing?
-Affirmative.

41:14.641 --> 41:16.810
So you don't want me
to see my destination.

41:17.603 --> 41:18.937
Why?

41:19.021 --> 41:23.066
Access to primary destination
is restricted to Raych Foss.

41:23.150 --> 41:24.902
Doesn't make any sense.

41:26.069 --> 41:27.946
I have to see it with my own eyes.

41:43.587 --> 41:48.342
86,981,959.

42:25.170 --> 42:26.505
Fall back!

42:26.588 --> 42:29.216
Fall back! Go! Go!

42:38.392 --> 42:40.602
-Mom!
-Here! Take this!

42:40.686 --> 42:42.229
Mom, let's go! Get out of here!

42:43.397 --> 42:44.398
Hurry up!

42:49.027 --> 42:50.028
What happened?

42:50.112 --> 42:52.739
She smuggled a field disrupter
into the building.

42:52.823 --> 42:55.284
-Where is she?
-At the curation storage.

42:55.367 --> 42:56.577
She has your mother.

43:04.751 --> 43:06.753
They've taken down
the imperial fence, sir.

43:06.837 --> 43:07.921
Cancel geosync.

43:08.005 --> 43:09.923
Commence landing. Maximum speed.

43:33.989 --> 43:35.240
Commander on deck!

43:36.366 --> 43:39.244
We make planetfall in five minutes.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.579
I want you to remember this.

43:40.662 --> 43:42.748
The Anacreons brought down
the Star Bridge.

43:42.831 --> 43:46.335
100 million dead at the hands
of these barbarians.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.962
I know this is personal for some of you,

43:49.046 --> 43:51.215
and that means
it's personal for all of us.

43:58.430 --> 44:00.807
-Right here, Warden.
-You okay?

44:00.891 --> 44:02.726
She needs the crew manifest
from the Deliverance.

44:02.809 --> 44:04.144
So that's what you're really after?

44:04.228 --> 44:06.605
We need help commandeering
an imperial ship.

44:06.688 --> 44:09.858
And we weren't gonna get it until
we had a knife to your people's throats.

44:09.942 --> 44:11.652
So now put that rifle down.

44:11.735 --> 44:14.029
Or what? You shoot her?
You honestly think that's an incentive?

44:14.112 --> 44:16.782
Mothers are mothers. You won't fire.

44:16.865 --> 44:18.492
Because there's an invisible cord
between us?

44:18.575 --> 44:21.370
Everyone says it. But I gotta tell you,
I've never felt it.

44:21.453 --> 44:24.331
You want me to throw the Foundation away
to save her?

44:24.414 --> 44:25.457
Cry all you want, Mom.

44:25.541 --> 44:28.085
Try to feel it,
like when I was four at the Vault,

44:28.168 --> 44:30.379
-and you crawled on the ground.
-I was terrified.

44:30.462 --> 44:33.090
Do it, Phara. Shoot your leverage
and let's start over. Even.

44:33.173 --> 44:35.467
Shut up, or we'll both be orphans!

44:35.551 --> 44:36.552
Fine!

44:42.224 --> 44:44.852
-Mom, I am so sorry.
-You were telling me to drop, yes?

44:44.935 --> 44:46.562
-Drop and crawl?
-That's right, Mom.

44:46.645 --> 44:48.730
-That's all you meant?
-You did good, Mom.

46:31.416 --> 46:33.836
Easy. Easy. You can do this.

46:34.920 --> 46:36.797
Breathe. Just breathe.

46:48.433 --> 46:49.643
Okay.

46:50.227 --> 46:52.729
Destination should be… here.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.148
Nothing.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.500
What are you hiding?

47:17.087 --> 47:18.630
I know something's out there.

47:19.631 --> 47:21.466
But nothing the naked eye can see.

47:23.427 --> 47:25.888
What could be out here that I can't see?

47:27.890 --> 47:30.767
Filter for infrared. Okay.

47:32.102 --> 47:35.772
White dwarf, supergiant…

47:38.066 --> 47:39.193
There you are.

47:39.776 --> 47:42.696
A dark star.
That's why I couldn't see you.

47:46.158 --> 47:47.242
A dark star.

47:50.704 --> 47:53.373
We're hovering. Altitude 1,000 meters.

47:53.457 --> 47:54.625
Open external comms.

47:56.293 --> 47:57.336
Stand down.

47:58.504 --> 47:59.755
Stand down.

47:59.838 --> 48:01.673
Hey, get out of here! Get out of here!

48:11.266 --> 48:12.392
Give it to me.

48:19.650 --> 48:21.944
Take a look, Warden. There.

48:22.027 --> 48:24.905
I understand what it is like
to lose everything.

48:24.988 --> 48:28.116
To watch your whole life burn.
I really do.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.702
The Empire took everything from me.

48:30.786 --> 48:33.664
And now we take everything from them.

48:33.747 --> 48:36.959
If your people really had
nothing to do with the Star Bridge,

48:37.042 --> 48:39.419
if Anacreon was innocent,

48:39.503 --> 48:41.463
how could you do the same thing
to Terminus?

48:41.547 --> 48:44.716
That's just it. Terminus isn't innocent.

48:45.384 --> 48:48.971
Seldon's predictions inflamed the Empire.

48:49.638 --> 48:54.226
Because of what your prophet said,
my whole world burned.

48:54.935 --> 48:55.936
Watch.

49:34.850 --> 49:36.185
Hugo!

49:40.022 --> 49:41.481
If you can see the sky,

49:41.565 --> 49:44.651
you are trespassing
on His Eminence's sovereign territory.

49:45.319 --> 49:47.988
By the authority of Emperor Cleon XIII,

49:48.071 --> 49:51.533
surrender immediately or face death.

49:52.659 --> 49:54.077
Ironwood Leader,

49:54.995 --> 49:56.079
you're cleared to proceed.

49:59.791 --> 50:00.792
Fire.

50:05.631 --> 50:07.799
-Kinetic weapon alert!
-Fire antimissile!

50:07.883 --> 50:09.426
Too close for intercept.

50:43.335 --> 50:46.547
Does it hurt any less?
Your brother, your family?

50:46.630 --> 50:49.550
You know what,
I thought I might feel empty.

50:50.092 --> 50:52.302
But I think it does hurt less.

50:52.386 --> 50:54.221
We should kill her and be done.

50:55.055 --> 50:56.515
We stick to the plan.

50:57.724 --> 50:59.142
She'll stay quiet.

51:15.409 --> 51:18.078
There's only one habitable planet
that orbits a dark star.

51:18.161 --> 51:20.539
And there is no way I'm going there.

51:24.668 --> 51:27.296
Computer,
I know our destination is Helicon.

51:27.379 --> 51:28.463
Change course.

51:29.923 --> 51:31.550
Helicon is Hari's homeworld.

51:32.259 --> 51:35.470
They think I killed him. Change course.

51:37.097 --> 51:38.640
Computer, are you there?

52:10.214 --> 52:11.423
Hari?

52:14.218 --> 52:15.219
Hari?
