WEBVTT

01:06.601 --> 01:09.235
Like I said, this place isn't
the tiptop, but it come pretty close.

01:09.237 --> 01:13.672
I mean, all the food's authentic,
the staff is super friendly

01:13.674 --> 01:15.140
I've never had
a bad experience here,

01:15.142 --> 01:17.075
so I hope you enjoy the spot.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.409
Yeah.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.744
Excuse me.
Are you ready to order?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.879
- Um...
- A couple of minutes, please.

01:21.881 --> 01:24.749
- Yeah, perfect. Take your time.
- Thank you.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.918
It does seem like
it's kind of a hidden gem.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.620
Oh, yeah, it certainly is.

01:29.622 --> 01:32.088
Cool.
Um, what were you gonna get?

01:32.090 --> 01:35.926
Um... Well, I typically get
the carbonara pasta.

01:35.928 --> 01:40.163
- It's got bits of bacon and the eggs.
- Mmm.

01:40.165 --> 01:43.032
It's an Italian classic.
What about you?

01:50.907 --> 01:52.040
What are you getting?

01:52.042 --> 01:53.107
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

01:53.109 --> 01:55.176
Um, that sounds good.

01:55.178 --> 01:58.846
I'm vegan, though, so I was actually
thinking of the meatless lasagna.

02:00.049 --> 02:01.648
That's right.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.850
That must be difficult. Yeah.

02:03.852 --> 02:08.255
I mean, like,
do you miss eating meat?

02:08.257 --> 02:11.657
- Hmm, sorry.
- No, no. Um...

02:11.659 --> 02:14.126
Not at all. I've been vegan
for like, nine years,

02:14.128 --> 02:16.596
so I don't really think about it anymore.
I would never go back.

02:18.066 --> 02:19.197
I do admit though,

02:19.199 --> 02:21.266
- I still like the smell of meat.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:21.268 --> 02:22.801
You know, especially bacon.

02:22.803 --> 02:24.970
Oh, hey, let me tell you.
I hear you.

02:24.972 --> 02:27.138
I can't imagine a world
without bacon.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.806
Really?

02:28.808 --> 02:30.373
You should try it sometime.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.941
You know, even just being vegan
for like a month.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.611
I haven't been sick
for like two years,

02:33.613 --> 02:35.179
and I swear
it's because my diet.

02:35.948 --> 02:37.348
Really?

02:37.350 --> 02:39.716
Well, that's crazy.

02:39.718 --> 02:42.085
You know, doesn't it seem like
every few years

02:42.087 --> 02:45.788
- there's like a new food topic trending.
- Mmm.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.191
We had GMOs and then
there was carbs and paleo

02:49.193 --> 02:53.829
and now the thing is like
all meat is bad, even chicken.

02:53.831 --> 02:55.330
You know what am I
supposed to eat?

02:55.332 --> 02:56.832
Just like fruits and vegetables?
Uh...

02:56.834 --> 02:59.634
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

02:59.636 --> 03:01.302
Sure. Fruits and
vegetables, though,

03:01.304 --> 03:02.837
maybe vegan's the way to go.

03:02.839 --> 03:05.973
You know, I'll think about it.

03:05.975 --> 03:08.775
Anyway, uh, I haven't had
their meatless lasagna

03:08.777 --> 03:12.278
but I have had the regular one
and it is bomb.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.214
All right, lasagna it is then.

03:14.216 --> 03:16.882
So, uh...

03:19.687 --> 03:21.153
What did you do today?

03:21.155 --> 03:23.255
Oh, sorry, sorry. Okay.

03:23.257 --> 03:26.658
I will not respond
to any more texts.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.826
- No worries.
- Um...

03:28.828 --> 03:31.262
Well, today's my day off
so I mostly just slept all day.

03:31.264 --> 03:32.997
Nice. You know, I love sleeping,

03:32.999 --> 03:34.399
it's my favorite hobby.

03:34.401 --> 03:36.366
Yes, mine too.

03:36.368 --> 03:38.117
Really?

03:38.119 --> 03:39.869
You know, maybe we should
collaborate again sometime.

03:39.872 --> 03:42.706
Mmm. Very funny.

03:42.708 --> 03:44.841
I think we've also
already done that.

03:45.743 --> 03:47.176
It was a bad joke.

03:48.713 --> 03:50.079
What did you do today?

03:51.149 --> 03:53.249
Uh, let's see. Not much.

03:53.251 --> 03:57.018
I went to the gym,
I did some laundry.

03:58.221 --> 04:00.722
Oh, I, uh, I saw a horror film.

04:00.724 --> 04:02.323
Oh, nice. Which one?

04:02.325 --> 04:04.892
Um...

04:04.894 --> 04:08.028
You know, I forget the name,
but, uh, it's about this couple

04:08.030 --> 04:10.464
and they go out
into the middle of nowhere

04:10.466 --> 04:12.433
- to take a break from their daily life.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:12.435 --> 04:16.402
Anyways,
the husband handcuffs the wife

04:16.404 --> 04:18.771
to a bed
to play some erotic games,

04:18.773 --> 04:20.973
but all of sudden the husband
has a heart attack

04:20.975 --> 04:24.176
so the wife is just left there
handcuffed to the bed frame

04:24.178 --> 04:25.444
and no one's there to help her.

04:25.446 --> 04:28.413
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that sounds intense.

04:28.415 --> 04:30.982
- Oh, yeah.
- What happens?

04:30.984 --> 04:32.951
Basically...

04:36.372 --> 04:39.023
Basically she starts to have all these hallucinations...

04:41.060 --> 04:43.393
She starts to have all these hallucinations...

04:43.395 --> 04:45.729
No, I'm not gonna reply.
It's fine.

04:45.731 --> 04:48.465
I mean, no, please, it's fine.

04:48.467 --> 04:51.134
Okay, okay. Just real quick.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.302
I think I could
stay up here forever.

05:32.005 --> 05:34.239
I don't wanna
go to work tomorrow.

05:34.241 --> 05:36.508
Yeah, it spoils you up here.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.209
It's too nice.

05:39.479 --> 05:40.911
How long did you say
your aunt's gone?

05:42.181 --> 05:43.981
Um, about another month.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.350
So... Another month.

05:46.352 --> 05:48.418
It's ours for the month
if you want.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.086
Absolutely.

05:51.990 --> 05:54.056
- Oh, she's lucky, man.
- Yeah.

05:54.058 --> 05:56.259
She gets to
travel the world for work

05:56.261 --> 05:57.527
and then comes home to this?

05:57.529 --> 06:00.862
Yeah, but that's...
She works super hard.

06:00.864 --> 06:02.630
You work super hard.

06:02.632 --> 06:04.399
You keep working hard,
you can have it too.

06:04.401 --> 06:06.168
Hmm, one of these days, maybe.

06:09.372 --> 06:10.938
Did you have
a good week at work?

06:11.574 --> 06:13.941
I was good.

06:13.943 --> 06:15.876
I don't wanna talk
about work though.

06:15.878 --> 06:17.978
Let's just enjoy the pool

06:17.980 --> 06:19.913
and the view
while we can, right?

06:19.915 --> 06:21.281
- All right.
- All right.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.963
Stop it. You know I hate that.

06:40.967 --> 06:44.836
Having a heart attack over here.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.639
Oh, you know what?

06:49.641 --> 06:51.875
- Actually, there is something I can tell you about work.
- What's that?

06:51.877 --> 06:53.510
Did I tell you about
the new guy, Lucas?

06:53.512 --> 06:55.178
No.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.246
Super fun guy.
Everybody loves him.

06:57.248 --> 06:59.248
Um, he has been, you know,

06:59.250 --> 07:02.284
like joking around with everybody in
the office, making everybody laugh.

07:02.286 --> 07:05.120
Um, and then Alfred,
that old curmudgeony guy

07:05.122 --> 07:06.422
- that like never...
- The mean old dude?

07:06.424 --> 07:09.090
Yes. Who never once
said hi to me.

07:09.092 --> 07:11.326
- Yeah.
- Never smiles, nothing.

07:11.328 --> 07:13.394
Um...

07:13.396 --> 07:15.563
So, Lucas is like trying to, uh,

07:15.565 --> 07:17.598
you know,
break your shell, whatever.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.533
Trying to talk to him.

07:19.535 --> 07:21.501
And he writes him
this little note,

07:21.503 --> 07:23.470
like on this Post-it,
on this, like, sticky note.

07:23.472 --> 07:25.873
And it's like a picture,
like Uncle Sam.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.206
Like, "I want you"
and it says, like,

07:27.208 --> 07:29.609
"I'm going to get you
to like smile at me, bud,

07:29.611 --> 07:32.078
"I'm not going to give up on you,"
like, something like that.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.080
And of course, you know like

07:34.082 --> 07:38.083
Alfred wouldn't typically go
for something like that.

07:38.085 --> 07:41.620
Lucas, I swear,
got the guy to smile.

07:41.622 --> 07:43.971
- No way.
- Someone walked by his office

07:43.973 --> 07:46.322
as Alfred's looking at it and he's smiling.

07:46.325 --> 07:49.894
Stinkin' Lucas
just cheers everybody up

07:49.896 --> 07:52.096
and makes the whole office better.

07:52.098 --> 07:54.632
- You sound a little jealous.
- I'm a little jealous.

07:54.634 --> 07:57.100
Alfred never says hi to me.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.369
At the same time, I mean, like,
this guy he just

07:59.371 --> 08:01.437
brightens up the whole office.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.506
It's awesome. Makes it a lot
easier to go to work tomorrow.

08:03.508 --> 08:05.107
- Sounds funny.
- Yeah.

08:05.109 --> 08:07.242
- Well, I could meet him.
- Yeah, you'd love him.

08:07.244 --> 08:08.626
Yeah?

08:08.628 --> 08:10.011
- Yeah.
- Cool, one these days.

08:10.014 --> 08:11.546
- One of these days.
- Hey.

08:11.548 --> 08:13.081
Stop!

08:13.083 --> 08:14.448
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:21.757 --> 08:23.257
It's chilly when the sun
goes down, huh?

08:33.301 --> 08:34.982
- Hey.
- Hey

08:34.985 --> 08:36.668
- You know what I was thinking?
- What were you thinking?

08:36.671 --> 08:38.270
Well, I was thinking,

08:38.272 --> 08:41.140
since I'm always
either at your place

08:41.142 --> 08:43.140
or you're always
over at my place

08:44.277 --> 08:46.077
That maybe we should
move in together.

08:47.213 --> 08:48.146
Really?

08:48.148 --> 08:50.415
Yeah, well, what do you think?

08:50.417 --> 08:54.318
I mean, I have to tell my
landlord, like, a month in advance,

08:54.320 --> 08:57.487
but that shouldn't be a problem,
we could do that.

08:57.489 --> 09:01.158
Yeah. So like my place is closer
to work for both of us, anyway.

09:01.160 --> 09:02.758
Yeah.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.360
- Or we could find something else?
- No. I like your place.

09:04.362 --> 09:05.995
We can move into your place.

09:05.997 --> 09:08.064
- Yeah?
- Look at us.

09:08.066 --> 09:09.665
Real adults.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.000
Kind of.

09:12.002 --> 09:13.702
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Do it?

09:13.704 --> 09:15.170
- Yeah
- Okay.

09:15.172 --> 09:16.705
Okay.

09:16.707 --> 09:19.174
I'm so excited.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.747
Yeah, I see,
I completely understand.

09:26.749 --> 09:29.216
We don't typically waive
that installation fee.

09:29.218 --> 09:32.418
The reason being we don't make
any money on the installation.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.353
That's actually the fee that

09:34.355 --> 09:36.289
we're charged
from a third party, so...

09:38.626 --> 09:41.059
Yeah, but you know what?
Let me, uh...

09:41.061 --> 09:42.677
Let me go speak to my boss and

09:42.679 --> 09:44.296
and see if there's anything
we could do to make

09:44.298 --> 09:46.431
this process
a little bit easier for you.

09:46.433 --> 09:47.499
How does that sound?

09:48.669 --> 09:50.134
Okay, hang tight for it.

10:01.213 --> 10:02.579
Hey, Nate.

10:02.581 --> 10:04.314
- Hey, Bruce.
- How's it going?

10:04.316 --> 10:06.449
Good. Just about to close
a deal with a client.

10:06.451 --> 10:09.118
I got him on hold, 'cause he
wants me to talk to the boss

10:09.120 --> 10:12.087
- about waving the installation fee.
- Hmm.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.757
Oh, man. People always expect
things for free, huh?

10:14.759 --> 10:16.458
Yeah.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.160
Just tell him
we don't make anything of that.

10:18.162 --> 10:19.727
Yeah, yeah, I already did.

10:19.729 --> 10:21.162
I'm gonna offer him
the payment plan

10:21.164 --> 10:23.331
that works 99% of the time.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.699
Smart.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.267
Come see me at my desk
when you leave.

10:26.269 --> 10:27.335
Sure.

10:32.708 --> 10:34.274
Josh, you still there?

10:36.779 --> 10:38.310
- Hey.
- Sit down.

10:41.115 --> 10:43.516
- How did it go?
- All good.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.818
Closed the deal. Easy peasy.

10:45.820 --> 10:49.154
I knew the second I walked into their
house, they would be interested.

10:49.156 --> 10:52.757
Good job.
You've had a good month.

10:52.759 --> 10:54.359
Made lot of sales.

10:54.361 --> 10:56.061
I'm really proud
of how far you've come.

10:56.063 --> 10:59.396
Thank you.
I've been working hard

10:59.398 --> 11:01.198
and honestly
I love the idea that

11:01.200 --> 11:02.699
contributing the environment,

11:02.701 --> 11:04.134
selling these solar panels.

11:04.136 --> 11:07.103
That's the right mindset, Nate.

11:07.105 --> 11:09.338
That's exactly why I want to
talk to you about something,

11:09.340 --> 11:12.542
- and see what you think about it?
- Yeah, sure.

11:12.544 --> 11:15.244
You know the office we opened in
New York City a few months ago?

11:15.246 --> 11:16.478
Yeah. How's that going?

11:17.548 --> 11:19.530
Not so good, apparently.

11:19.532 --> 11:21.515
I was there last week and the
place is a complete shit show.

11:21.518 --> 11:24.419
- That sucks.
- The sales seem eager to learn,

11:24.421 --> 11:27.455
but Ron, the guy I hired to
train them, is a complete mess.

11:27.457 --> 11:30.073
He's never in the office.

11:30.075 --> 11:32.692
I did some social media stalking
on him and found out

11:32.695 --> 11:35.795
he's always going to these yacht
parties and getting trashed.

11:35.797 --> 11:37.831
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.299
I talked to another guy
in the office who said,

11:39.301 --> 11:40.867
on the rare occasion,
that he does make it in

11:40.869 --> 11:43.203
he's usually hung over
and sleeping at his desk.

11:43.205 --> 11:45.170
And while the sales team is
out there trying to make sales

11:45.172 --> 11:47.355
and when they fuck up
and they need guidance,

11:47.357 --> 11:49.541
the guy they're supposed to
go to is crashed at his desk.

11:50.678 --> 11:53.278
- That's a bummer.
- Yeah.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.346
That's where you come in.

11:55.348 --> 11:58.549
I want you to go over there
and get that team going.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.818
I can't think of
a better manager than yourself.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.554
New York? Me a manager?

12:05.257 --> 12:07.557
Wow, Bruce,
that's an amazing opportunity.

12:08.594 --> 12:10.260
Well, you deserve it.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.429
And it's only for six months
just to get the ball rolling.

12:12.431 --> 12:15.331
After that, you'll come back
here, you'll still be a manager.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.600
But we'll give you 50% increase
in your base salary.

12:17.602 --> 12:22.138
Plus, you'll get a percentage of the
sales that your entire team makes.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.471
Oh, wow.

12:23.473 --> 12:25.406
That sounds awesome.

12:25.408 --> 12:27.575
I've always wanted
to train a team of people.

12:28.879 --> 12:31.379
I don't know what to say. Um...

12:31.381 --> 12:33.881
Let me think about it, and, uh,
I'll give you an answer in the morning.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.150
No, no, no, no.

12:36.152 --> 12:38.752
This is not one of those times
when you think about it.

12:38.754 --> 12:41.622
You say, "Thank you" and
"When do I leave?"

12:43.224 --> 12:45.791
I just wanted
to talk to Jessica,

12:45.793 --> 12:48.194
you know,
before I made any decisions.

12:49.764 --> 12:53.832
Listen to me,
you're a smart guy,

12:53.834 --> 12:56.835
you don't wanna be knocking on
doors for the rest of your life.

12:56.837 --> 13:00.238
And Jessica, she'll be happy that
you're making a lot more money.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.339
Maybe you can buy her
some nice gifts.

13:02.341 --> 13:05.176
And six months
goes by in a flash.

13:06.312 --> 13:08.379
Any chance it'll last longer
than six months?

13:08.381 --> 13:10.514
No chance.
Big sales are still here,

13:10.516 --> 13:12.582
so I'll need you to come
back here and head up this team.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.555
Yeah, I guess six months
isn't that long.

13:18.557 --> 13:21.390
I've been wanting a change
of air for a while now anyways.

13:21.392 --> 13:25.360
That's the spirit. And as for
Jessica, let me tell you something.

13:25.362 --> 13:27.629
I've been traveling back
and forth to the East Coast

13:27.631 --> 13:31.299
since I've been married and my
wife and I... still together.

13:31.301 --> 13:33.634
Still going strong for 22 years.

13:33.636 --> 13:35.970
Twenty-two years. Wow.

13:35.972 --> 13:37.905
Oh, hey.
You wanna see the apartment

13:37.907 --> 13:39.574
we're gonna put you up in?
Come here.

13:39.576 --> 13:42.209
Yeah. Let's see.

13:46.815 --> 13:49.349
Okay, so this
overlooks Central Park.

13:49.351 --> 13:51.884
- This is the view from the balcony.
- Wow.

13:51.886 --> 13:54.853
Living room.
Twenty-four/seven security.

13:54.855 --> 13:57.323
Check this out.
Parking in the basement.

14:00.327 --> 14:01.759
Hey.

14:01.761 --> 14:05.296
- Oh, hey.
- Thanks for waiting.

14:05.298 --> 14:07.498
- Yeah, no worries. Um...
- Mmm-Hmm.

14:08.735 --> 14:10.334
Oh, yeah.

14:12.271 --> 14:14.838
So, uh,
what have you been up to?

14:15.975 --> 14:19.008
Um, pretty busy with work,
I guess.

14:19.010 --> 14:21.677
I have to read these
contracts that my boss has draft

14:21.679 --> 14:23.913
and make sure they look okay.

14:23.915 --> 14:27.283
Uh, it's a little stressful. Just
because the deadline's are pretty tight.

14:27.285 --> 14:30.485
Yeah, I'm sure
you'll be just fine.

14:30.487 --> 14:34.623
I mean, you're very smart
and very dedicated.

14:35.726 --> 14:37.259
Thanks.

14:37.261 --> 14:39.827
Yeah, it's just
a lot of responsibility, um...

14:39.829 --> 14:42.596
They know what they're doing, but if
something's wrong and I don't catch it

14:42.598 --> 14:44.732
it's my fault
and we're pretty much screwed.

14:44.734 --> 14:47.001
Oh, yeah. I mean, I hear you.

14:47.003 --> 14:48.868
- It does not seem fun.
- No.

14:51.306 --> 14:52.538
So, what's up with you?

14:52.540 --> 14:54.239
Oh...

14:54.241 --> 14:55.941
Honestly, I don't know,
I was kind of surprised

14:55.944 --> 14:59.478
that you contacted me after two
weeks of not talking, you now.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.647
Managed to resuscitate a ghost.

15:01.649 --> 15:05.617
What do you mean?

15:05.619 --> 15:09.587
Well, obviously you ghosted me
after a month of dating.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.624
Honestly, I didn't feel
great about it.

15:13.626 --> 15:16.293
- Ghosted?
- Yeah.

15:16.295 --> 15:18.461
Like, when instead of
just telling someone

15:18.463 --> 15:19.996
you don't want to
see them anymore,

15:19.998 --> 15:21.831
you just
cut them off completely.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.967
Okay. Well, I didn't ghost you.

15:23.969 --> 15:25.668
We just stopped talking.

15:25.670 --> 15:28.353
Yeah, what's the difference?

15:28.355 --> 15:31.039
I mean you never texted me again after we
went out to that restaurant in Pasadena.

15:31.042 --> 15:33.642
Okay, well you never
texted me either.

15:33.644 --> 15:37.578
I mean, ghosting is when you actually
ignore someone's attempts to contact you.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.447
Yeah, whatever.

15:39.449 --> 15:41.482
Why didn't you contact me then?

15:42.752 --> 15:44.519
I just thought that...

15:44.521 --> 15:46.920
you know, maybe you weren't
interested anymore.

15:47.790 --> 15:50.924
Oh. Why?

15:50.926 --> 15:54.460
I don't know. Maybe the way
you were communicating with me.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.596
I just got tired of the chase.

15:57.598 --> 16:00.566
Always texting,
calling you first.

16:00.568 --> 16:03.669
It seemed like someone else
was on your mind.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.971
Oh. Why did you think?

16:06.973 --> 16:08.873
Oh, that night
at the restaurant, mainly.

16:09.943 --> 16:13.078
I mean, you were
in your phone all night,

16:13.080 --> 16:15.379
and whenever you got
a text message,

16:15.381 --> 16:17.548
this smile just
came across your face. So...

16:17.550 --> 16:18.949
I don't know.

16:18.951 --> 16:20.351
Oh.

16:20.353 --> 16:23.786
Well, there wasn't anyone else
I was seeing.

16:25.523 --> 16:28.091
Oh, my God. No, no, no.
It was just my friend Rachel.

16:28.093 --> 16:30.126
She was texting me.
All those photos of her,

16:30.128 --> 16:33.362
like trying on old dresses
before she went out.

16:33.364 --> 16:36.465
Some of them were ridiculous.
That was it.

16:37.501 --> 16:39.134
Okay.

16:39.136 --> 16:41.436
So why didn't you contact me?

16:42.772 --> 16:46.774
I guess I just didn't think
you wanted to see me.

16:48.444 --> 16:50.578
I though you seemed
kind of distant.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.946
And I don't know, maybe you were
looking for something fun.

16:52.948 --> 16:55.849
Which honestly isn't really
what I'm looking for.

16:55.851 --> 16:57.867
Well, I mean, hey,

16:57.869 --> 16:59.886
I'm not looking for a no strings
situation either, so...

17:02.456 --> 17:05.491
Okay. I guess I had
the wrong impression.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.792
Yeah, I think we both did.

17:12.464 --> 17:15.800
So, uh, now that
that's sorted out.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.837
Can we start over?

17:19.839 --> 17:22.571
I mean, I don't know, we could
catch a movie or something.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.540
Okay, yeah. What kind of movie?

17:24.542 --> 17:28.478
- Uh, do you like thrillers?
- Hmm.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.579
Or we could see a rom-com,
it's fine.

17:30.581 --> 17:33.416
Oh, no, no, no. I was just
trying to think of some thrillers

17:33.418 --> 17:35.618
that have come out recently.
I love thrillers.

17:35.620 --> 17:37.553
I would be
totally down for that.

17:38.890 --> 17:39.954
Cool.

17:42.426 --> 17:44.426
Hey, what about the one
you were telling me about

17:44.428 --> 17:45.927
the last time we went out?

17:45.929 --> 17:48.029
Uh, which one?

17:48.031 --> 17:49.830
The um, the creepy movie

17:49.832 --> 17:52.633
with the woman that gets her
hands handcuffed to the bed

17:52.635 --> 17:54.101
while her husband
has a heart attack.

17:54.103 --> 17:56.503
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

17:56.505 --> 17:58.906
Yeah. No, that one's not in
theaters, I streamed it on Netflix

17:58.908 --> 18:00.506
Oh.

18:00.508 --> 18:03.643
Well, I mean, we could just do
something else then.

18:03.645 --> 18:06.446
I mean, if you want, you know,
we could do that.

18:06.448 --> 18:09.114
Come on,
I mean Netflix and Chill.

18:09.116 --> 18:10.649
Shut up.

18:15.088 --> 18:16.521
I just wanna
go into a food coma.

18:16.523 --> 18:18.889
I'm so stuffed.

18:26.032 --> 18:27.730
Let's just go to bed dressed.

18:29.534 --> 18:31.868
Oh, it's so pretty outside.

18:33.171 --> 18:35.905
Couch.

18:39.043 --> 18:41.577
It is nice. It's really nice.

18:42.179 --> 18:43.679
Pretty clear night.

18:48.084 --> 18:50.785
Yeah, picked a good
restaurant tonight.

18:50.787 --> 18:54.755
- Authentic Italian food.
- Hmm. good.

18:54.757 --> 18:56.957
I'm glad your belly
is happy and full.

18:56.959 --> 19:00.060
You know that is one of
De Niro's favorite restaurants.

19:01.697 --> 19:03.346
What?

19:03.348 --> 19:04.998
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That was so rude.
- I'm serious.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.565
I'm serious.

19:06.567 --> 19:08.734
I believe you, I believe...
I just, I'm sorry.

19:08.736 --> 19:10.970
It was, I just, as soon as
you said De Niro.

19:10.972 --> 19:14.073
I just pictured Lucas' face
during his De Niro impression.

19:14.075 --> 19:15.907
It's ridiculous, anyway,
I can't.

19:17.244 --> 19:20.812
- His De Niro impression?
- Yeah, it's really good.

19:20.814 --> 19:22.914
Oh, Lucas.

19:22.916 --> 19:25.049
He's just a little too funny,
isn't he

19:26.252 --> 19:29.686
- Are you jealous?
- Jealous?

19:29.688 --> 19:31.989
- That face says it all right there.
- Jealous...

19:31.991 --> 19:36.726
I'm just saying you talk about Lucas
more than you talk about anybody else.

19:36.728 --> 19:40.963
Okay, I also talk about
my 70-year-old landlord. A lot.

19:40.965 --> 19:42.665
Too much, probably.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.066
You think I have a thing
for him, too?

19:45.168 --> 19:47.068
- No.
- No.

19:47.070 --> 19:50.872
- Oh, speaking of my landlord, I gave him my 30 days.
- Oh.

19:50.874 --> 19:52.741
He was like super bummed
but, you know.

19:52.743 --> 19:56.710
Um, I completely forgot
to tell you.

19:56.712 --> 19:59.547
Um, talked to my boss today.

20:01.083 --> 20:05.084
- You wanna come sit down?
- Yeah. Is everything...

20:05.086 --> 20:06.252
- Yeah.
- ...okay?

20:06.254 --> 20:08.721
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...

20:08.723 --> 20:10.890
- Good I think, um...
- Okay.

20:10.892 --> 20:13.026
You know my boss called me
into his office.

20:14.762 --> 20:18.230
He told me what a great job
I've been doing lately and...

20:18.232 --> 20:20.098
you know, I've been closing
a lot of deals,

20:20.100 --> 20:24.168
- and he's really proud of me and...
- Good.

20:24.170 --> 20:26.037
Um, he kind of,

20:27.607 --> 20:30.341
- well, he wants promote me.
- Babe.

20:30.343 --> 20:33.343
- Oh, my God, that's awesome, that's...
- Yeah.

20:33.345 --> 20:35.145
You had me so worried
for a minute.

20:35.147 --> 20:36.813
I know, but, you know,

20:36.815 --> 20:38.882
we're opening
the new branch in New York.

20:38.884 --> 20:41.051
- Yeah.
- And so...

20:41.053 --> 20:45.220
The manager they had
didn't really work out.

20:45.222 --> 20:46.989
He wants to send me up there.

20:46.991 --> 20:48.924
- To, uh...
- To New York.

20:48.926 --> 20:52.694
- Yeah. To kind of train their sales team
- Mmm-hmm.

20:52.696 --> 20:57.131
and get everything
off the ground and running.

20:57.133 --> 21:01.868
- How long would you be there?
- It'd be for six months and...

21:04.039 --> 21:07.274
you know, I've never been in
a management position before

21:07.276 --> 21:10.776
and I'd have like six or eight
people under me,

21:10.778 --> 21:11.911
Yeah.

21:14.749 --> 21:17.717
But, you know,
it's really not that big a deal.

21:17.719 --> 21:19.151
I'll just tell him
I'm not interested in it and...

21:19.153 --> 21:21.720
- No, no, no, no. Shush.
- I'll find something else here.

21:21.722 --> 21:24.789
Shut your
beautiful face.

21:24.791 --> 21:27.058
I'm so excited for you.

21:27.060 --> 21:30.027
I'm just really sad for me 'cause
I'm not gonna have you here.

21:31.263 --> 21:33.230
It'd only be for six months.

21:33.232 --> 21:35.199
Yeah, right.

21:35.201 --> 21:36.967
Yeah, that's not that long.

21:36.969 --> 21:38.369
- Right? I mean that's nothing.
- Right.

21:38.371 --> 21:40.203
That's like what? Half a year.

21:40.205 --> 21:42.639
- You sure it's okay?
- Yes.

21:45.010 --> 21:48.378
Wow, that's weird. We've never
spent that much time apart before.

21:48.380 --> 21:51.146
I know. We can talk everyday.

21:52.149 --> 21:54.049
- Skype or...
- Yeah.

21:56.020 --> 21:59.120
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

22:00.123 --> 22:02.256
I'm also really excited for you.

22:02.258 --> 22:04.125
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

22:04.127 --> 22:05.660
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

22:05.662 --> 22:07.928
It's actually
kind of perfect timing

22:07.930 --> 22:11.798
because my aunt
is now going to Japan.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.167
- I know, uh, but...
- Really?

22:14.169 --> 22:16.136
Yeah, but this is gonna be...

22:16.138 --> 22:21.206
wide open, so I can move out,
hang out here.

22:21.208 --> 22:23.275
So you get to
stay here some more.

22:23.277 --> 22:25.711
Mmm-hmm.
Don't look at me like that.

22:25.713 --> 22:28.379
- Okay.
- It's such a rough life

22:28.381 --> 22:29.881
- you got here.
- I know.

22:29.883 --> 22:31.382
But I'm gonna be all alone.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.685
Alone in your mansion.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.219
- Yes.
- With the pool.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.456
- I think you're gonna be all right.
- Just be like,

22:39.458 --> 22:41.291
- just be sad for me for a second, okay?
- Okay.

22:41.293 --> 22:44.995
- And then I can be like super excited for you.
- Okay. All right.

22:47.865 --> 22:48.998
Aw...

22:50.334 --> 22:53.169
Hey, man.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.104
- How's it going? Thank you.
- Yeah, how's it going?

22:55.106 --> 22:57.806
Ah, it's going,
it's going, you know.

22:57.808 --> 23:00.175
Same old, same old.
Still the same job.

23:00.177 --> 23:02.243
Same apartment, same life.

23:03.313 --> 23:05.313
Good.
Glad to hear you're doing well.

23:05.315 --> 23:07.347
- How's everything with you?
- Good.

23:07.349 --> 23:09.750
I actually, uh...

23:09.752 --> 23:12.319
I actually just got a job offer
to move up to New York.

23:12.321 --> 23:15.322
Be a manager for six months at
our company's office up there.

23:15.324 --> 23:19.792
- New York. All right. That sounds exciting.
- Yeah.

23:19.794 --> 23:21.427
- So, what did you say?
- I said yes, man.

23:21.429 --> 23:25.964
It's a huge promotion.
Plus, it's only six months so why not?

23:25.966 --> 23:28.300
That and my boss didn't really
give me much of an option.

23:28.302 --> 23:30.068
Didn't let me think about it, so...

23:30.070 --> 23:32.204
Well, it sounds like
a great opportunity.

23:32.206 --> 23:33.805
Yeah, I think so.

23:33.807 --> 23:35.172
What did Jessica say about it?

23:36.342 --> 23:39.009
Uh, she was a little
upset at first.

23:39.011 --> 23:42.079
We had... We had just agreed
to move in together.

23:42.081 --> 23:45.749
Right before
I got this offer, so...

23:45.751 --> 23:48.785
But she understands that
it's a big opportunity.

23:48.787 --> 23:50.353
So, I think
she's happy about it.

23:50.355 --> 23:54.790
Moving in together, you know,
that's a big step. Congrats.

23:54.792 --> 23:57.526
Yeah, I guess
that won't be happening.

23:57.528 --> 24:00.496
- Not for six months at least.
- No.

24:00.498 --> 24:03.998
Oh, wait Did you know that, uh,
Erica recently moved to New York.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.135
Yeah, yeah.
I follow her on Instagram.

24:07.137 --> 24:10.104
I don't plan on seeing her,
I don't wanna start any issues with Jess.

24:10.106 --> 24:12.373
Yeah, hey.
I get it, I get it.

24:12.375 --> 24:16.343
So are you gonna tell
Jessica that Erica's there?

24:17.379 --> 24:18.812
It's not worth it.

24:18.814 --> 24:21.181
I don't want her to worry
for no reason.

24:22.784 --> 24:24.383
Ah, well, I think
you should tell her.

24:26.254 --> 24:30.489
I mean if she finds out that your
ex is in the same city as you,

24:30.491 --> 24:32.057
she might not take it that well.

24:32.793 --> 24:34.526
Hmm, well...

24:34.528 --> 24:37.428
Its's not really what
I'm worried about right now.

24:37.430 --> 24:39.330
Oh, yeah?
What are you worried about then?

24:43.169 --> 24:46.069
There's this coworker
that Jess keeps talking about.

24:46.071 --> 24:47.871
This Lucas guy.

24:47.873 --> 24:50.040
She keeps talking about
how funny he is,

24:50.042 --> 24:51.474
and how everyone
in the office loves him.

24:51.476 --> 24:53.910
Even the old guy
who doesn't say hi to anybody,

24:53.912 --> 24:56.179
- says hi to Lucas.
- Oh, come on.

24:56.181 --> 25:00.349
You don't think
that she likes him like that.

25:00.351 --> 25:02.818
I mean if she's comfortable enough
to bring him up in front of you

25:02.820 --> 25:06.555
that probably means that you have
nothing to worry about, don't you think?

25:06.557 --> 25:08.890
Look, I'm, I'm almost positive

25:08.892 --> 25:10.825
that she wouldn't do
anything like that with him,

25:10.827 --> 25:14.328
but we have never
spent this much time apart.

25:14.330 --> 25:17.097
I don't wanna be thinking the
whole time that I'm in New York,

25:17.099 --> 25:19.600
that she's spending all her
free time with this other dude.

25:19.602 --> 25:23.002
Look, that's understandable,
but she's a nice girl

25:23.004 --> 25:25.004
and I'm sure
she'd never betray you.

25:25.006 --> 25:27.140
Besides, you need to be focused
on other things right now.

25:27.142 --> 25:29.309
Like how you two
are gonna stay in touch.

25:31.011 --> 25:33.378
Wish it were that easy,
but it's not.

25:37.918 --> 25:39.218
Look, I need your help, man.

25:39.220 --> 25:40.985
My help? Sure you got it.

25:42.622 --> 25:44.589
Wait, I'm not following her man.

25:44.591 --> 25:46.357
No, no. I don't want you
to follow her.

25:48.061 --> 25:49.426
Okay.

25:49.428 --> 25:51.127
So what do you need from me?

25:51.129 --> 25:55.232
It's a pretty big favor.
You might think I'm crazy.

25:56.635 --> 25:58.268
Okay. Just say it.

25:59.203 --> 26:00.269
Come on, what is it?

26:02.006 --> 26:04.006
I want you to try
and seduce her.

26:06.010 --> 26:07.076
What?

26:10.580 --> 26:12.480
What? No.

26:12.482 --> 26:14.282
No, no. You're joking.

26:15.252 --> 26:16.317
I'm dead serious.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.894
She's your girlfriend, man.

26:27.896 --> 26:30.179
You're about to
move in with her.

26:30.181 --> 26:32.465
I don't wanna be remembered as
the guy who tried to seduce her.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.234
- Imagine if you marry her then. Come on.
- Yes, exactly.

26:35.236 --> 26:37.936
That's exactly it.
What if I marry her?

26:37.938 --> 26:39.670
And then I find out later that

26:39.672 --> 26:41.405
she slept with her coworker
or some other guy.

26:41.408 --> 26:43.942
Don't you think it's a little
too late at that point?

26:46.380 --> 26:48.178
Yeah.

26:51.117 --> 26:54.585
This is very weird.
No one requests this.

26:54.587 --> 26:57.553
Do you realize
how absurd this sounds?

26:57.555 --> 27:00.924
We're not teenagers anymore,
man.

27:00.926 --> 27:04.327
I would do whatever I can
to help you, but...

27:04.329 --> 27:07.362
You're like a brother to me,
but this is absolutely crazy.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.064
Come on, dude.

27:09.066 --> 27:12.234
Okay, imagine this scenario,
I try to seduce her,

27:12.236 --> 27:15.103
she most likely will reject me,
and from then on,

27:15.105 --> 27:17.138
I'm labeled as
your creepy friend

27:17.140 --> 27:19.307
who has no sense of boundaries.

27:19.309 --> 27:22.343
I'll be the unwanted guest at
all of your parties and events.

27:22.345 --> 27:25.445
Imagine me being the best man at your
wedding after something like that.

27:25.447 --> 27:27.447
I can't imagine it.

27:27.449 --> 27:30.717
So why me, man? Why can't you
find someone else to do this?

27:30.719 --> 27:33.186
Because out of all my friends,

27:33.188 --> 27:35.554
out of everybody I could
possibly ask to do this,

27:35.556 --> 27:37.556
you're the only one she trusts.

27:37.558 --> 27:39.959
You're my best friend, man.

27:39.961 --> 27:41.427
She trusts me. Oh, for what?

27:41.429 --> 27:45.496
She trusts you enough to spend
some time alone with you.

27:48.601 --> 27:50.501
Jesus, this is absolutely crazy.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.105
Okay, um...

27:56.041 --> 27:58.075
Say that I agreed to do this

27:58.077 --> 28:00.243
and I'm not agreeing.

28:01.981 --> 28:06.382
When? Just how would I
even approach her?

28:06.384 --> 28:10.219
I mean, there's gotta be some
places that you all go in common.

28:11.456 --> 28:12.988
Where do both you hang out?

28:15.392 --> 28:17.058
I don't know.

28:21.131 --> 28:22.197
Well...

28:24.533 --> 28:27.267
Jessica. Jess.

28:28.604 --> 28:30.070
Jess.

28:31.574 --> 28:34.474
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

28:34.476 --> 28:36.075
I was really...

28:36.077 --> 28:37.643
Yeah, yeah, no,
you're killing it on there.

28:37.645 --> 28:40.013
- Thank you.
- How you been?

28:40.015 --> 28:41.546
Pretty good.

28:41.548 --> 28:43.148
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:43.150 --> 28:45.317
My work's been good, I...

28:47.488 --> 28:50.188
How you been? I thought,
I thought you usually go

28:50.190 --> 28:51.756
to the gym during the day,
I've never...

28:51.758 --> 28:54.158
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I normally do but, uh,

28:54.160 --> 28:57.094
you know, new management
at the restaurant, so,

28:57.096 --> 28:59.630
my schedule's
a little crazy right now.

28:59.632 --> 29:01.097
Sure, yeah.

29:01.099 --> 29:03.500
So, uh,
Nate's going to New York soon.

29:03.502 --> 29:06.603
- Yeah, he is.
- How are you doing about that?

29:06.605 --> 29:10.506
Yeah, I'm really excited
for him. So it's... it's great.

29:10.508 --> 29:12.608
Um, it's only six months,

29:12.610 --> 29:15.144
but it'll go by fast. plus we're
gonna Skype every day and

29:15.146 --> 29:18.347
and keep in touch and everything.
I might go visit him.

29:18.349 --> 29:20.347
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

29:20.349 --> 29:22.348
Yeah, yeah, and while you're here,
don't think about it too much

29:22.350 --> 29:24.350
- 'cause it'll be over before you know it.
- Exactly.

29:24.354 --> 29:29.223
Plus then it gives me more
time to work out every day.

29:29.225 --> 29:30.791
Work on my perfect body

29:30.793 --> 29:33.560
so he sees what he's missing.

29:34.663 --> 29:36.946
- Well, you look great.
- Thank you.

29:36.948 --> 29:39.231
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll let you get back to it.
- Thanks.

29:39.233 --> 29:42.168
- Hit my stuff and I'll catch you in a little bit.
- Okay, cool.

29:50.343 --> 29:52.077
Hey, Jess.

29:52.079 --> 29:53.812
Totally forgot
o mention this earlier,

29:53.814 --> 29:56.381
but there's this bar
that opened down the street

29:56.383 --> 29:58.816
Doing a promo for
dollar drinks this weekend.

29:58.818 --> 30:00.317
- Dollar drinks?
- Yeah.

30:00.319 --> 30:03.120
- That's unheard of in LA.
- Yeah, I know.

30:03.122 --> 30:05.489
That's great.
Yeah, we gotta go.

30:05.491 --> 30:08.491
Uh, I think Nate has
like next Friday off.

30:08.493 --> 30:10.560
Well, you see, it's a promo.

30:10.562 --> 30:13.496
It's opening weekend
and today's the last day.

30:14.566 --> 30:16.365
I'm going
right after I shower up.

30:16.367 --> 30:19.468
- Um, you're welcome to come if you're free.
- Um...

30:19.470 --> 30:23.738
- Yeah. No, I'm not doing anything. Yeah, let's, let's go.
- Cool.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.141
- I just need to, I need to change and everything.
- Yeah, yeah, no. Shower up.

30:27.143 --> 30:29.243
Give me like 20 minutes,
is that cool?

30:29.245 --> 30:31.612
- Sounds good, sounds good.
- Yeah, I'll see you in a minute.

30:31.614 --> 30:32.680
Will do.

30:39.721 --> 30:40.854
Hey, so this is it.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.856
Oh, I remember this.

30:42.858 --> 30:45.825
I remember this used to be
the Blind Gypsy.

30:45.827 --> 30:47.860
Oh, that was like
a billion years ago.

30:47.862 --> 30:51.196
The place has changed management
like four times since then.

30:51.198 --> 30:53.398
Okay, well, it's a really hard
business to keep going,

30:53.400 --> 30:55.400
- especially in L.A.
- Oh, yeah.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.273
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Nate.

31:03.877 --> 31:05.742
How'd it go?

31:05.744 --> 31:09.212
- How'd it go, what?
- Come on, dude.

31:09.214 --> 31:12.181
Stop being funny.
Jess texted me last night.

31:12.183 --> 31:15.150
She said she ran into you at the gym,
y'all were going to the bar afterwards.

31:16.354 --> 31:19.889
- What happened?
- What did she tell you about it?

31:19.891 --> 31:22.925
She texted me when I was at dinner
with my boss and some investors.

31:22.927 --> 31:26.461
- I didn't reply 'cause I didn't wanna interrupt.
- So you ignored it.

31:27.831 --> 31:29.531
Yeah, that was the whole plan.

31:29.533 --> 31:31.699
To see what she would do
when she was alone with you.

31:34.470 --> 31:36.270
So, what happened?

31:37.740 --> 31:39.773
Okay, well, I went to the gym,

31:39.775 --> 31:44.844
'cause you told me that she's
normally there after nine and she was.

31:44.846 --> 31:48.381
So I told her about this new bar
that was opening up down the street.

31:48.383 --> 31:51.651
So we went to the grand opening,
had a couple drinks.

31:52.754 --> 31:55.220
Okay, so what happened
after the bar?

31:55.222 --> 31:56.388
Well, first we got
a little drunk

31:56.390 --> 31:58.557
because, you know,
we had a couple shots.

32:00.761 --> 32:02.360
Go on.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.562
Oh, my God.

32:05.631 --> 32:08.432
- She was so rude.
- I know.

32:08.434 --> 32:11.802
How do they expect to keep a business
going if that's their service.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.670
Oh, dollar drinks maybe?

32:13.672 --> 32:16.272
Yeah, yeah. As long as it lasts.

32:16.274 --> 32:18.708
Hey, uh, let me
walk you to your car.

32:18.710 --> 32:20.810
- Aw, thank you.
- Yeah.

32:22.913 --> 32:24.346
This is my car.

32:24.848 --> 32:26.281
Yep.

32:29.954 --> 32:32.353
Hey, uh, listen.

32:33.656 --> 32:35.423
I hope you had fun tonight.

32:35.425 --> 32:38.492
I did. I wish Nate
could've come though.

32:38.494 --> 32:41.728
- Yeah, well. Next time.
- Yeah.

32:42.998 --> 32:44.631
- Oh.
- Oh, I got it.

32:44.633 --> 32:48.735
Sorry, I'm... I'm drunk.

32:48.737 --> 32:52.805
Yeah, well, it's difficult to say no to dollar shots.

32:52.807 --> 32:56.308
Yeah. I just don't know if tequila
was the best option for me.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.410
Yeah.
But it was in a plastic bottle.

32:58.412 --> 33:00.346
It's where they keep all the classy stuff.

33:00.348 --> 33:01.846
You know that.

33:03.350 --> 33:06.551
Anyways, are you sure that
you should drive?

33:06.553 --> 33:08.653
- I don't want you getting a DUI or anything happening.
- Oh.

33:08.655 --> 33:11.288
No, no, I'm just, I'm just gonna
sleep in the back,

33:11.290 --> 33:13.323
for like an hour
until I feel like I can.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.325
- Got you, got you.
- Yeah.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.361
It's not a bad idea, but, um,

33:17.363 --> 33:20.730
I'm actually like,
five blocks this way.

33:20.732 --> 33:24.667
It you want a couch to crash on,
you have one.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.870
It's up to you. You can go to
work in the morning.

33:27.872 --> 33:30.705
- Play it safe tonight.
- Are you sure?

33:30.707 --> 33:32.440
Yeah. Absolutely.

33:36.313 --> 33:37.612
Hey, you coming or not?

33:45.888 --> 33:47.554
Here we are.

33:47.556 --> 33:49.555
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

33:49.557 --> 33:54.594
- Let me go get you some blankets so you don't freeze.
- Okay.

34:12.911 --> 34:14.312
Here you are.

34:14.313 --> 34:16.313
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.831
And this is for you.

34:39.803 --> 34:41.569
Oh.

34:45.442 --> 34:49.376
So... I have a question for you.

34:49.378 --> 34:52.411
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hey, relax.

34:52.414 --> 34:54.748
Something I ask everybody.

34:54.750 --> 34:57.817
How do you really measure
the strength of a relationship?

34:59.821 --> 35:05.623
- Oh. That's a really deep question.
- Yeah.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.526
Uh... I don't know. I guess
it would really depend on

35:08.528 --> 35:11.496
the bond between
the people in it.

35:11.498 --> 35:14.965
Yeah but I mean,
how can you test

35:14.967 --> 35:19.503
what a relationship would
be able to really endure?

35:19.505 --> 35:22.473
I mean it'd have to go through
something major. Right?

35:22.475 --> 35:27.610
Like something that's out of the
ordinary, not, you know,

35:27.612 --> 35:31.447
some drastic event
or something?

35:31.449 --> 35:34.383
Okay... can you give me
any examples?

35:34.385 --> 35:35.884
Um...

35:35.886 --> 35:38.487
I don't know. Some
big difference in priorities

35:38.489 --> 35:41.623
or some big... change.

35:41.625 --> 35:44.458
- Or something...
- Yeah. No, okay.

35:44.460 --> 35:46.527
You have
better ones but uh...

35:48.731 --> 35:50.398
What about distance?

35:52.034 --> 35:53.767
Yeah, I mean...

35:55.504 --> 35:57.704
Yeah, I guess
it's a good example.

35:57.706 --> 36:01.107
Why are you asking me all of this?

36:01.109 --> 36:02.941
I'm just a curious person.

36:04.512 --> 36:08.414
I like to ask
complicated questions. Sorry.

36:08.416 --> 36:12.450
No worries. I mean,
you know obviously...

36:12.452 --> 36:18.890
Nate and I are going to be going through
distance and that is going to be...

36:18.892 --> 36:21.759
a test on our relationship.

36:21.761 --> 36:28.632
So, yeah, I guess that's a good
example of what you're talking about.

36:28.634 --> 36:34.804
Yeah. And you know, I think that
you guys are gonna just do fine.

36:34.806 --> 36:39.975
I mean after all, I'll be here watching
you and so will Erica with Nate.

36:40.978 --> 36:42.577
Erica?

36:42.579 --> 36:45.914
You mean his ex.
She's in New York?

36:46.650 --> 36:47.849
You didn't know?

36:47.851 --> 36:49.851
No, I had no idea.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.487
What is she doing in New York?

36:53.489 --> 36:56.790
Well, she moved there to
pursue her dream.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.592
Acting on Broadway.

36:58.594 --> 37:01.928
She's been there for a couple
of months now, actually.

37:01.930 --> 37:05.898
- Really?
- I follow her on Instagram. That's how I know about this.

37:09.070 --> 37:11.770
Did Nate mention anything
about this to you?

37:13.240 --> 37:14.973
Yeah, well, I mean...

37:17.144 --> 37:19.177
He said that
he's gonna avoid her.

37:19.179 --> 37:24.882
so that he doesn't create any
unnecessary issues between you and him.

37:24.884 --> 37:29.219
All right. So then I guess the reason
he tell me just because he forgot.

37:29.221 --> 37:33.656
Right? Because it's not a big deal
to move to the same city as your ex.

37:33.658 --> 37:35.992
Why would that be relevant
information to tell me?

37:35.994 --> 37:42.764
Yeah, no.
You do have a point. It kind of is.

37:42.766 --> 37:46.001
I'm sure that he just didn't
want you to worry while he was...

37:46.003 --> 37:49.670
Worry? Is there something
I should worry about?

37:49.672 --> 37:52.707
I mean if... if he's so secure
in his intentions...

37:52.709 --> 37:55.576
I mean why is he so...
Why hasn't he mentioned it?

37:55.578 --> 37:58.545
I can't fucking believe
he didn't mention it to me.

37:58.547 --> 38:01.581
- You think he will?
- I don't know.

38:06.255 --> 38:07.753
I'm sorry.

38:09.690 --> 38:15.261
Hey listen, I'm a big believer
in the theory that

38:15.263 --> 38:21.232
if a relationship is strong enough
like, even if Nate and Erica hang out,

38:21.234 --> 38:23.868
there's nothing
to worry about.

38:24.804 --> 38:26.937
Like us right now, for example.

38:26.939 --> 38:29.606
we can hang out.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.276
Nothing to worry about
because if anything did happen,

38:32.278 --> 38:36.913
that would mean that you don't love
Nate enough to be exclusive with him.

38:38.716 --> 38:43.886
And that you guys aren't
even supposed to be together.

38:43.888 --> 38:47.022
I mean, obviously the same
thing goes for Nate too...

38:47.024 --> 38:49.691
I mean if he really did
anything with her and...

38:49.693 --> 38:55.863
I think you'll be fine but
that would mean that...

38:55.865 --> 38:59.800
he doesn't love you enough to resist
any temptation that might occur.

39:01.637 --> 39:05.370
Yeah I guess that's true.

39:05.372 --> 39:09.107
I mean if anything were to happen it would
just mean that we weren't meant to be.

39:09.911 --> 39:11.077
Exactly.

39:13.882 --> 39:18.050
Take us, for example,
no matter how close I get to you,

39:20.354 --> 39:25.890
you've got nothing to worry about
because you really love him.

39:27.093 --> 39:28.659
Right.

39:29.762 --> 39:30.895
And...

39:32.932 --> 39:35.932
You don't even...

39:38.370 --> 39:43.839
if I touched you, there's
nothing to worry about.

39:45.676 --> 39:48.877
'cause you really
care about him.

39:50.081 --> 39:51.213
Huh.

39:54.618 --> 39:56.217
And even...

40:01.157 --> 40:02.689
if I kissed you.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.691
I need to go.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.830
Why are you running away?

40:09.832 --> 40:11.064
What?

40:11.066 --> 40:13.899
You're afraid of
what you might do.

40:13.901 --> 40:15.868
Why are you doing this?

40:15.870 --> 40:19.337
Because I want you two
to be happy

40:19.339 --> 40:22.806
and if you can't even endure stuff like
this, then why even be together at all?

40:22.809 --> 40:25.110
I'm not doing anything,
I'm actually leaving.

40:25.112 --> 40:28.179
You can't control how you feel
so you're avoiding it.

40:28.181 --> 40:30.181
You know what? You can
believe whatever you want.

40:30.884 --> 40:32.116
I will.

40:34.020 --> 40:36.754
You know what?
I don't run away from shit.

40:36.756 --> 40:38.255
Okay.

40:38.257 --> 40:41.306
I can stay here

40:41.308 --> 40:44.359
because I know my intentions...
and you can go sleep in your room.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.666
Sure.

40:55.806 --> 40:57.239
Good night.

41:07.083 --> 41:09.783
Oh, my God. Dude, you scared
the shit out of me.

41:12.387 --> 41:15.088
You're talking about how you kissed her
and then she was kissing you back...

41:15.090 --> 41:16.890
Well... She... I didn't say
that she kissed me back.

41:16.892 --> 41:21.026
I mean it was so quick that she
didn't realize what happened.

41:21.028 --> 41:25.698
Whatever, man. It's just a kiss.
Big fucking deal.

41:25.700 --> 41:30.401
When you started telling that story, I was
picturing in my head that y'all were...

41:30.403 --> 41:32.103
Hooking up and you're...

41:34.240 --> 41:36.307
I don't want to even
think about it.

41:39.478 --> 41:41.778
The important thing is
that I was wrong about her.

41:46.151 --> 41:48.050
Well, there is something else.

42:38.030 --> 42:39.497
Sorry about...

42:55.813 --> 43:00.115
Look man, I'm so sorry. I had no idea
that this is how it would've happened.

43:04.021 --> 43:06.187
I asked you to do it.

43:07.023 --> 43:09.524
Don't even think about it.

43:09.526 --> 43:13.327
Although it wasn't just her,
I mean...

43:13.329 --> 43:15.395
Alcohol was involved too,
obviously.

43:17.166 --> 43:18.865
What did she say after?

43:20.135 --> 43:23.869
- She just made me promise not to tell you.
- Shit.

43:25.173 --> 43:26.972
She felt pretty
guilty about it.

43:26.974 --> 43:29.275
She should feel really
guilty about it.

43:31.145 --> 43:33.012
What are you going to do?

43:33.014 --> 43:34.345
I'm not going to do anything.

43:35.382 --> 43:38.149
I'm gonna wait until
she confesses.

43:39.586 --> 43:41.352
What if she doesn't confess?

43:41.354 --> 43:43.803
She'll confess.

43:43.805 --> 43:46.256
And if she doesn't, I'll find
one or another to make her.

43:46.258 --> 43:49.827
And if she confesses,
what are you going to do at that point?

43:49.829 --> 43:52.462
I'm gonna break up with her
and I'm never see her again.

43:52.464 --> 43:55.598
God, man. Why don't you
just break up with her now?

43:58.002 --> 43:59.836
I wanted to feel all of this.

43:59.838 --> 44:03.905
I want her to feel all the
guilt and all the shame

44:03.907 --> 44:06.608
for doing this to me.

44:06.610 --> 44:09.878
And breaking up with her now,
would be way too easy on her

44:11.348 --> 44:13.314
I want to see
how far she'll go.

44:23.124 --> 44:25.491
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

44:30.398 --> 44:34.299
So... What's up?
What did you wanna talk about?

44:37.938 --> 44:39.204
Okay.

44:39.206 --> 44:45.109
Amber, I wanna make this easy
as possible for both of us.

44:45.111 --> 44:47.545
So, I'm just gonna go
to the point.

44:47.547 --> 44:49.547
Okay...

44:49.549 --> 44:54.384
So, uh... I think
it's not gonna work out.

44:54.386 --> 44:58.989
And we should stop
seeing each other.

45:01.559 --> 45:03.626
I can't tell if you're being
serious right now

45:03.628 --> 45:05.628
- or if you're just joking around or...
- Amber...

45:08.466 --> 45:09.530
Oh.

45:11.134 --> 45:14.235
Wow. That's unexpected.

45:15.505 --> 45:17.305
Sorry, I...

45:18.908 --> 45:20.240
I think it's for the best.

45:22.011 --> 45:26.413
Okay. Well, um...

45:26.415 --> 45:30.683
thanks for coming here and
telling me in person, I guess.

45:30.685 --> 45:33.452
Especially, since we're not
really in a relationship yet.

45:33.454 --> 45:36.589
Well... yeah.

45:38.458 --> 45:42.294
Honestly, I felt bad about the
way I handled things before.

45:42.296 --> 45:46.431
- Hmm.
- And I thought that I owed you this.

45:46.433 --> 45:49.300
I mean, coming here
and telling you in person.

45:50.670 --> 45:52.970
No ghosting this time.

45:52.972 --> 45:56.307
Umm...
thanks for that, I guess.

45:57.275 --> 46:00.677
Amber, you're a great girl.

46:02.681 --> 46:05.248
You're gonna find someone
else just as great.

46:05.250 --> 46:08.450
It's just that
I'm not that person.

46:09.420 --> 46:12.887
Sure.

46:12.889 --> 46:16.357
Still, I... I don't know, I guess I thought
it was going pretty well between us.

46:16.360 --> 46:19.093
I mean, even if you're just
getting to know each other.

46:19.095 --> 46:21.595
Yeah, I mean,
things weren't going bad.

46:23.499 --> 46:25.499
So, why don't you wanna
see me anymore?

46:27.102 --> 46:29.436
Uh... is there someone else?

46:29.972 --> 46:31.438
No, I...

46:33.208 --> 46:36.041
I just need some time

46:37.244 --> 46:39.645
to be by myself and...

46:39.647 --> 46:42.548
I can't be in a relationship
right now.

46:43.684 --> 46:45.450
Fine.

46:45.452 --> 46:49.587
Sure. Um... okay.
Goodbye, John.

46:50.590 --> 46:51.723
Bye.

46:52.525 --> 46:53.591
Bye.

46:58.464 --> 47:00.998
No, I'm sorry.
That is bullshit.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.101
Three weeks ago, we met up, and you told
me you were looking for a relationship.

47:05.103 --> 47:09.205
And now, you're saying you
don't want anything serious?

47:09.207 --> 47:14.075
Come on. At least have the dignity
to admit that you just don't like me.

47:14.077 --> 47:18.213
That's not true. I liked you enough
to hang out with you several times.

47:18.215 --> 47:20.081
Okay, then, what happened?

47:20.083 --> 47:23.051
I mean, I get it, I understand,
you just don't wanna be with me

47:23.053 --> 47:26.553
but what, you just woke up this morning
and thought, "What am I doing with her?"

47:26.555 --> 47:28.455
Okay, uh...

47:30.393 --> 47:33.626
- 100% honest?
- Yes. Please!

47:35.296 --> 47:36.562
There's someone else.

47:38.700 --> 47:39.766
Oh.

47:41.336 --> 47:43.201
And do you love her?

47:43.203 --> 47:44.736
No.

47:44.738 --> 47:46.638
No, I'm not in love.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.740
But you really like her?

47:51.345 --> 47:55.146
I think so. Uh...
I don't know.

47:58.217 --> 48:00.117
But she loves you?

48:02.054 --> 48:03.119
I don't think she does.

48:04.322 --> 48:06.389
But she at least
likes you, right?

48:08.160 --> 48:10.326
I honestly don't know.

48:10.328 --> 48:13.829
- It's very complicated.
- Jesus.

48:13.831 --> 48:17.566
But she at least knows that
you like her, right?

48:21.738 --> 48:25.139
I don't think.

48:25.141 --> 48:28.643
So, what are you waiting for?
Why don't you tell her that?

48:34.783 --> 48:36.483
So...

48:38.287 --> 48:41.353
How are you feeling?

48:41.355 --> 48:43.856
Uh, I don't know, John.
What do you think?

48:43.858 --> 48:46.459
I mean... how do you feel?

48:48.329 --> 48:50.562
Like everything's fucked up.

48:50.564 --> 48:53.731
Yeah. Well, not alone there.

48:54.768 --> 48:56.167
Yeah. Sure.

49:00.773 --> 49:04.575
I have some errands I have to run.
I can't really stay long.

49:04.577 --> 49:07.144
Oh, yeah. No, right.
Totally. Um...

49:10.748 --> 49:12.882
I really don't know how to
tell you this.

49:12.884 --> 49:15.485
Why don't you just try?

49:17.222 --> 49:19.221
Okay. Um...

49:20.657 --> 49:21.723
Nate knows

49:21.725 --> 49:24.259
- everything about us.
- What?

49:26.697 --> 49:29.897
John, you promised that
you wouldn't say anything.

49:29.899 --> 49:33.233
It was just a one time's...

49:33.235 --> 49:36.570
He asked me to do this to you, Jess.
He asked me to seduce you.

49:36.572 --> 49:40.740
What? That doesn't make any sense.
What would he do that?

49:40.742 --> 49:42.742
'Cause he doesn't
trust you, okay?

49:42.744 --> 49:46.146
He's moving out of state and he's
afraid that you're gonna go hookup

49:46.148 --> 49:50.149
with that funny co-worker of yours that
you always rave about in front of him.

49:50.151 --> 49:54.386
Lucas? Are you kidding right now?
Because this isn't fucking funny.

49:54.388 --> 49:57.288
No, I'm serious.
He designed this sort of

49:57.290 --> 50:01.659
"Trust-test" for you and
I wish I was joking, trust me.

50:01.661 --> 50:05.530
God! This is completely crazy.

50:05.532 --> 50:09.699
And you agreed to do this. You played
me into cheating on him with you,

50:09.701 --> 50:12.602
so that
you could prove a point?

50:12.604 --> 50:14.471
Why can't he just confront me?

50:14.473 --> 50:16.505
Because that's not the type
of guy Nate is.

50:16.507 --> 50:23.312
Look, Jess, unfortunately, Nate's not
the same guy I knew in middle school.

50:23.314 --> 50:27.315
And he's not the same guy
that you fell in love, either.

50:27.317 --> 50:30.185
Well, you agreed to do it.
So you're not that great either.

50:30.187 --> 50:31.653
Yeah. I know.

50:31.655 --> 50:34.522
For that, I apologize. Okay?

50:36.859 --> 50:40.694
You know, you're not an angel
either. I mean...

50:40.696 --> 50:43.530
I didn't exactly make you
sleep with me, did I?

50:43.532 --> 50:46.532
No, but I felt like shit
about it since.

50:46.534 --> 50:50.736
I mean, I slept with
his best friend.

50:50.738 --> 50:55.240
And now you're telling me,
that you planned this! This is sick!

50:55.242 --> 50:57.342
That is fucking sick!

50:57.344 --> 50:59.578
You know what? I'm leaving.

51:00.614 --> 51:03.281
- Don't.
- Why?

51:03.283 --> 51:08.886
Because... Geez, this is so fucked up and
in one way, this is everybody's fault.

51:08.888 --> 51:12.289
But... now we know,
you two weren't meant to be together.

51:12.291 --> 51:16.793
Okay but why are you
telling me all this, John?

51:16.795 --> 51:21.531
Does pointing out how shitty my relationship
relieve you of some of the guilt or something?

51:21.533 --> 51:23.799
I am not trying to justify
what I did.

51:23.801 --> 51:27.836
Okay then why am I here, John?

51:27.838 --> 51:31.773
'Cause maybe I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you since then.

51:31.775 --> 51:34.342
Oh, my God.

51:34.344 --> 51:38.879
So, you called me today,
to tell me that you have feelings for me?

51:40.316 --> 51:43.816
What do you expect me to say?

51:43.818 --> 51:47.320
"Based upon how shitty my relationship
is, oh hey, since Nate's out of town,"

51:47.322 --> 51:48.488
"Why don't we get
together instead?"

51:48.490 --> 51:50.724
Yeah, well, not exactly.

51:51.660 --> 51:53.626
Leave me alone.

51:53.628 --> 51:55.661
Jess, wait.
One minute, please.

51:55.663 --> 51:57.997
What? What! What do you want?

52:00.434 --> 52:03.166
What are you gonna
do with Nate?

52:03.168 --> 52:05.902
I don't know but since apparently he
already knows, I'm sure it'll come up.

52:11.277 --> 52:12.809
What if it doesn't?

52:15.948 --> 52:19.850
I mean it's got to, right?
If he cares... at all.

52:31.962 --> 52:33.361
Uh...

52:33.363 --> 52:35.563
Babe...

52:35.565 --> 52:38.366
I forgot to tell you about the
craziest thing that happened at work.

52:38.368 --> 52:40.634
- Lucas, you remember?
- Yeah.

52:40.636 --> 52:43.070
- He got fired.
- Really?

52:43.072 --> 52:46.073
Because, first of all,
he lied on his resume.

52:46.075 --> 52:49.842
But he was planning on robbing the
bank that his girlfriend worked at.

52:49.844 --> 52:53.012
They, like, found all
this plans and everything

52:53.014 --> 52:56.416
and when they looked into it, they found
out that he had this whole criminal record

52:56.418 --> 52:59.651
that like, somehow, they overlooked
during the interview process.

52:59.653 --> 53:02.321
- Isn't that crazy?
- No kidding.

53:02.323 --> 53:04.689
That is insane.

53:04.691 --> 53:07.058
It's like... anyway, now they're
like investigating the whole thing.

53:07.061 --> 53:10.428
It's a big nightmare but...

53:10.430 --> 53:13.898
- He's a more interesting dude than I thought.
- Yeah. Right?

53:13.900 --> 53:16.767
It is like a whole double life.

53:16.769 --> 53:18.702
Oh, there is something else
I want to tell you.

53:18.704 --> 53:22.772
Um, so I was at the gym,
the other day and I ran into John.

53:22.774 --> 53:25.475
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, we were both there working out,

53:25.477 --> 53:29.478
Um... did he tell you
that he saw me?

53:29.480 --> 53:33.649
Anyway, he was telling me about this backyard...

53:33.651 --> 53:36.352
across the street...

53:36.354 --> 53:37.618
Is that your phone?

53:37.620 --> 53:38.986
Hold on a sec.

53:38.988 --> 53:43.424
Hello? No, it's ok.

53:44.461 --> 53:45.760
Yeah, what's up?

53:49.631 --> 53:50.997
By tomorrow?

53:50.999 --> 53:54.701
Yeah. No, it's fine.
It's fine.

53:54.703 --> 53:56.503
Yeah. All right.

53:56.505 --> 53:57.837
All right, bye.

53:58.873 --> 54:00.806
Sorry about that.

54:00.808 --> 54:02.742
What were you saying?

54:03.878 --> 54:07.379
Uh... I don't know...

54:08.782 --> 54:11.416
All right. It's not that
important if you can't remember.

54:13.920 --> 54:18.422
Don't forget I'm leaving
at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.

54:19.658 --> 54:21.992
All right. I'll be over
Monday night then.

54:21.994 --> 54:23.794
Okay. Cool.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.472
Jessica.

54:38.942 --> 54:42.811
He didn't mention it to me.
Why?

54:47.683 --> 54:50.418
- He didn't?
- No.

54:50.420 --> 54:53.888
Actually, he acted
completely normal.

54:55.857 --> 54:57.924
You did tell him, right?

54:57.926 --> 55:00.676
You didn't lie about that?

55:00.678 --> 55:03.429
No, I didn't lie to you.
I told him everything about us.

55:03.432 --> 55:06.098
Well then,
why didn't he say anything?

55:06.100 --> 55:07.900
Does he even care?

55:11.672 --> 55:14.806
I think that he's waiting
for you to confess.

55:14.808 --> 55:17.108
What makes him so sure
that I would confess?

55:17.110 --> 55:20.978
Does he know that
I know about the plan?

55:20.980 --> 55:23.880
I can't tell him about that.

55:23.882 --> 55:25.582
Then what is he waiting for?

55:27.619 --> 55:29.986
What if I don't say anything?

55:29.988 --> 55:32.922
Then, what, he's just going
to go to New York and...

55:32.924 --> 55:35.925
break up with me
over the phone?

55:35.927 --> 55:38.561
Or pretend like nothing
ever happened?

55:38.563 --> 55:43.097
I think he's pretty sure that you're
gonna come clean about this soon.

55:43.099 --> 55:47.602
He doesn't view you as the type of
person that can hold a secret and

55:47.604 --> 55:52.473
I don't know.
He didn't really explain it to me.

55:52.475 --> 55:54.141
I don't know.

55:55.511 --> 55:57.844
What I do know is that,

55:57.846 --> 56:00.180
when you do confess, that's when
he plans on breaking up with you.

56:00.182 --> 56:06.185
So, he's just trying to punish
me by drawing it out and...

56:06.187 --> 56:08.087
and ending it anyway.

56:09.057 --> 56:11.056
God, what kind of person
does this?

56:11.058 --> 56:12.958
- This is so fucked up.
- Hey.

56:14.661 --> 56:16.828
He's gonna leave soon.

56:16.830 --> 56:20.265
Whatever you two tell
each other, it's going down.

56:21.801 --> 56:23.567
It's for the best that it does.

56:24.070 --> 56:26.369
You think?

56:26.371 --> 56:28.671
Look, I mean, do you really
wanna be with someone like that

56:28.674 --> 56:30.074
after knowing all this?

56:31.042 --> 56:33.943
I mean, what we did
was wrong.

56:33.945 --> 56:38.248
But at the end of the day, it would've
never happened if Nate didn't set it up.

56:38.250 --> 56:42.985
But part of the reason that it happened
was because of how close we were.

56:45.222 --> 56:47.656
For what it's worth,
I didn't think you we're gonna do anything

56:47.658 --> 56:48.724
with that coworker.

56:48.726 --> 56:50.992
- I wasn't
- I know, you're smart.

56:52.595 --> 56:53.928
You're caring.

56:55.265 --> 56:56.564
You're absolutely beautiful.

57:00.869 --> 57:04.304
He doesn't deserve someone
like you, so just, please,

57:04.306 --> 57:06.006
give me a chance.

57:08.010 --> 57:10.175
I'm not gonna hurt you
like he did.

57:20.820 --> 57:22.854
Bruce, it's Nate.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.255
Hey, what's going on?

57:29.895 --> 57:31.194
Oh, really?

57:46.911 --> 57:52.314
I think that's the last of it.
All ready to go.

57:56.619 --> 58:00.654
What?
I know...

58:01.724 --> 58:03.324
Six months is a long time.

58:04.226 --> 58:06.159
Yeah, it's far.

58:06.161 --> 58:10.730
New York is like the other
side of the world basically

58:10.732 --> 58:12.231
Hardly.

58:13.835 --> 58:17.636
Like half-way maybe?
Quarter of a way?

58:17.638 --> 58:19.137
Yeah, maybe a quarter.

58:20.341 --> 58:24.610
- We'll be all right though.
- I know and...

58:24.612 --> 58:26.611
- I'm excited for you.
- Yeah.

58:26.613 --> 58:29.146
Got nothing to worry about.
We trust each other.

58:30.817 --> 58:32.283
Yeah.

58:32.285 --> 58:37.354
- It's a big opportunity.
- Yeah. I'm proud of you. I am.

58:37.356 --> 58:40.957
- Just gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you too.

58:40.959 --> 58:44.094
- Love you.
- Love you.

58:44.096 --> 58:47.963
- Don't cry every day.
- I'll try not to.

58:47.965 --> 58:50.265
- You're gonna be a big boy.
- Yeah, yeah.

58:53.270 --> 58:56.904
Can we just stay here
for a minute?

58:56.906 --> 58:58.272
For a minute.

59:02.178 --> 59:04.845
You know
what's great about us?

59:04.847 --> 59:09.950
You mean beside the fact that we're
both just devastatingly attractive?

59:09.952 --> 59:11.652
Well, yeah. Besides that.

59:12.755 --> 59:15.855
Well, what is so
great about us?

59:15.857 --> 59:21.694
- We, unlike all these other chumps around here,
- Mmm-hmm.

59:21.696 --> 59:23.428
still believe in commitment.

59:24.931 --> 59:29.267
Relationships are changing.

59:29.269 --> 59:31.336
People don't
believe in that anymore.

59:31.338 --> 59:32.836
Yeah.

59:32.838 --> 59:34.338
That's what makes
us so strong.

59:36.208 --> 59:39.109
Makes us so good together,
you know.

59:39.111 --> 59:42.111
We can always trust
each other, no matter what.

59:45.850 --> 59:50.253
Even with all these crazy
dating apps and...

59:51.356 --> 59:53.121
social media.

59:56.360 --> 01:00:01.029
Always on us,
world where it's so easy to cheat now.

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.369
I know that I can trust
you, no matter what.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.237
Because we tell
each other everything.

01:00:13.108 --> 01:00:15.442
It's what a good relationship
is built on.

01:00:15.444 --> 01:00:20.246
Built on that trust,
and that loyalty and honesty.

01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:29.188
And no matter what, I don't
have to worry about anything.

01:00:36.396 --> 01:00:37.829
It's the same for you.

01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:44.234
Right?

01:00:49.307 --> 01:00:50.740
Everything okay?

01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.380
What's wrong?

01:01:01.852 --> 01:01:03.184
Um...

01:01:07.023 --> 01:01:12.092
I haven't been completely
honest with you

01:01:12.995 --> 01:01:15.129
or completely loyal.

01:01:16.866 --> 01:01:18.297
What are you talking about?

01:01:23.872 --> 01:01:25.905
Uh...

01:01:28.308 --> 01:01:32.911
So, a couple of weeks ago,
I was working out,

01:01:32.913 --> 01:01:35.514
I ran into John.

01:01:35.516 --> 01:01:40.384
- Yeah, you told me that.
- Um...

01:01:41.888 --> 01:01:43.854
Well, I didn't
mention that we...

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.928
uh, that bar across the street
had just opened up,

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:55.231
- it was 1600 or something.
- Yeah.

01:01:55.233 --> 01:01:59.468
They were having this
promotion that week

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:04.273
because it was new...
uh, doesn't matter, anyway...

01:02:04.275 --> 01:02:06.841
So, we went over to
check it out and...

01:02:09.045 --> 01:02:11.846
we got really drunk and...

01:02:17.352 --> 01:02:18.552
And?

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.927
And...

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.834
And we kissed, um...

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.342
Did you...

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:50.914
sleep with him?

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.286
Babe...

01:02:57.288 --> 01:03:03.425
It was just... I'm sorry.
It was... It was stupid.

01:03:05.495 --> 01:03:08.179
I'm so sorry.

01:03:08.181 --> 01:03:10.866
I don't know... It was just...
I was drunk. We were so drunk.

01:03:10.868 --> 01:03:12.934
I felt guilty for weeks.

01:03:14.403 --> 01:03:16.503
Weeks about going
on this trip.

01:03:19.275 --> 01:03:21.141
- I was afraid of hurting you...
- I know...

01:03:21.143 --> 01:03:22.543
- hurting us...
- I know. Please. Please.

01:03:22.545 --> 01:03:24.577
Can we just talk
about it, please?

01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:28.348
- Sorry.
- I almost didn't take this job.

01:03:32.953 --> 01:03:34.453
I'm sorry.

01:03:37.157 --> 01:03:38.557
I need you to go.

01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:42.393
- Babe, please.
- Go! I said, go! Get out!

01:03:45.365 --> 01:03:47.265
I don't wanna see you again.

01:04:01.312 --> 01:04:02.978
Yeah, man. She just left.

01:04:03.915 --> 01:04:05.047
Yeah, come on up.

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:27.100
- John.
- Hey, what's up?

01:04:27.102 --> 01:04:29.369
Can I get you anything?
Soda or anything?

01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:31.537
Uh... yeah, water's great.

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:33.940
So, how did it go?

01:04:36.978 --> 01:04:41.379
Everything went perfect.
Exactly how we planned it.

01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:44.149
- She admitted everything.
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:44.151 --> 01:04:46.618
- Came right out and said it.
- Nice.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:48.086
I'm scot-free.

01:04:49.689 --> 01:04:51.221
I'm officially single again.

01:04:51.223 --> 01:04:53.390
Finally. Finally.

01:04:53.392 --> 01:04:55.225
That's good to hear.

01:04:55.227 --> 01:04:59.395
Single, ready to take on New
York, look at you.

01:04:59.397 --> 01:05:02.365
No. Uh... I thought
I told you.

01:05:02.367 --> 01:05:05.501
Did I not?
Last week, my boss called.

01:05:05.503 --> 01:05:08.203
It fell through and
I'm not going to New York.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:10.238
My bags are empty,
there's nothing in 'em.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.573
Oh, shit.

01:05:11.575 --> 01:05:14.609
- You all right, man?
- Yeah. Yeah...

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:17.979
- I mean it's for the best, really.
- Cool, cool.

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:20.414
Now that I'm free and...

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:23.150
- So...
- Back in the game.

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:28.588
You're gonna tell Jess that you're
still living in L.A., right?

01:05:29.391 --> 01:05:31.257
I don't know why I would.

01:05:31.259 --> 01:05:33.426
I don't owe her anything.

01:05:33.428 --> 01:05:37.029
- Okay...
- She cheated on me.

01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:40.248
Yeah.

01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:43.468
Look dude, I know you're still feeling
weird about it. But, don't. All right?

01:05:43.471 --> 01:05:49.741
I asked you to do this and you stuck your
neck out there and you did it for me.

01:05:49.743 --> 01:05:52.210
You have nothing
to feel guilty about, man.

01:05:52.212 --> 01:05:55.013
- I know...
- I'm glad you did it.

01:05:55.015 --> 01:05:58.015
- I know.
- It was going down, man.

01:05:58.017 --> 01:06:01.284
If it was not for you,
she would've slept with somebody else.

01:06:01.286 --> 01:06:03.687
And I never would've known.

01:06:03.689 --> 01:06:06.756
You know what I'm saying,
it could've been a lot worse.

01:06:06.758 --> 01:06:09.759
- Yeah.
- I could've...

01:06:10.762 --> 01:06:13.095
proposed or something crazy.

01:06:13.097 --> 01:06:18.099
- And found out later.
- Yeah, Nate, uh...

01:06:18.101 --> 01:06:20.802
you know, I've actually,

01:06:20.804 --> 01:06:24.305
you know, I've seen Jess
a couple of times.

01:06:24.307 --> 01:06:27.174
She hit you up again?

01:06:27.176 --> 01:06:29.643
- Yeah.
- She is freaking ruthless, man.

01:06:29.645 --> 01:06:32.780
- I mean...
- Who are you texting?

01:06:35.717 --> 01:06:39.385
"Hey, can't wait to see
you again - Jess."

01:06:39.387 --> 01:06:42.255
She's seriously hitting you
up right now.

01:06:42.257 --> 01:06:44.456
She didn't leave here
two minutes ago, man.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:47.292
- I told you she's crazy.
- She was upset.

01:06:47.294 --> 01:06:48.527
You saved my life, man.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.063
Of course.

01:06:52.199 --> 01:06:53.764
You're not gonna see her,
are you?

01:06:56.602 --> 01:07:00.604
Nate, I've been seeing her,
I've been texting her.

01:07:00.606 --> 01:07:03.807
This has been going on
ever since that night.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:07.744
It's not gonna happen again,
right, John?

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:13.849
- Jesus.
- John.

01:07:18.856 --> 01:07:21.256
What are you thinking, man?

01:07:21.258 --> 01:07:23.524
Once a cheater
is always a cheater.

01:07:23.526 --> 01:07:26.127
If she's willing to do it to me,
she's willing to do it to you.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.099
I don't wanna...

01:07:32.101 --> 01:07:34.267
Oh, my God.

01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:36.736
I don't know what to say.

01:07:36.738 --> 01:07:38.605
You know what? Fine.

01:07:38.607 --> 01:07:40.407
But when she does
the same shit to you,

01:07:40.409 --> 01:07:42.808
don't come crying to me
because I won't be around.

01:07:44.412 --> 01:07:46.512
If you do this,
we're done, man.

01:07:47.849 --> 01:07:49.582
Wow.

01:07:55.555 --> 01:07:57.856
Well, like I said. I'm sorry.

01:07:59.192 --> 01:08:00.692
John.

01:08:02.128 --> 01:08:03.627
John!
