00:46.631 --> 00:48.466
<i>Welcome to Slaughterhouse.</i>

00:48.633 --> 00:52.679
<i>An unashamedly exclusive pillar
of excellence.</i>

00:52.846 --> 00:55.640
<i>No other school in England
or indeed on Earth...</i>

00:55.807 --> 00:59.185
<i>...can rival our glorious surroundings.</i>

00:59.352 --> 01:03.273
<i>A place at Slaughterhouse is the envy
of the civilised world.</i>

01:03.732 --> 01:06.025
- Slaughterhouse?
<i>- From these hallowed fields...</i>

01:06.192 --> 01:07.360
Weird name for a school.

01:07.527 --> 01:10.280
<i>Generations of young Slaughterians
have left their mark.</i>

01:10.447 --> 01:13.533
I went to see
the headmaster yesterday.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.828
- He was very impressive.
- Why are you showing me this?

01:16.995 --> 01:21.708
Don, a place has come free next term.
This never usually happens.

01:22.542 --> 01:25.795
You know we talked about
moving schools. This is our chance.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.424
What, at Slaughterhouse?
Is this an April Fool joke?

01:29.591 --> 01:33.386
No. I drove six hours there and back
yesterday to see the headmaster.

01:33.553 --> 01:37.182
Do I look like I'm joking? You need to
knuckle down, work hard like your dad.

01:37.348 --> 01:39.184
Dad left school at 16, Mum.

01:39.350 --> 01:43.438
Dad worked his bollocks off, and
he never had opportunities like this.

01:43.605 --> 01:46.608
You sit around here all day,
doing bugger all, drinking pop...

01:46.775 --> 01:48.902
...and playing computer games
with your friends.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.198
And you don't get up till after midday.
You're depressed.

01:53.364 --> 01:56.326
You're out of milk, Mrs Wallace.

01:56.868 --> 01:57.911
Thanks, Mikey.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.664
That's what I mean.
You need some new friends.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.459
You could be rubbing shoulders
with the leaders of tomorrow.

02:04.626 --> 02:06.878
Future prime ministers, actors...

02:07.045 --> 02:08.670
...spies, pop stars.

02:08.838 --> 02:12.175
You need to learn
some survival skills. Get real, Don.

02:12.342 --> 02:16.346
Real? Mum, this ain't real.
This is just a bunch of stuck-up twats...

02:16.513 --> 02:20.183
...with a load of money.
All right? Look.

02:21.226 --> 02:23.978
- They've got their own army.
- It's cadets.

02:24.145 --> 02:28.024
You've got other fun activities too.
Look. Sports, girls.

02:28.483 --> 02:32.070
You know,
it's like a very exclusive holiday camp.

02:32.237 --> 02:35.323
<i>...to your child's precious career.</i>

02:35.490 --> 02:37.992
- I love you to bits...
- Yes! Ha-ha!

02:38.159 --> 02:40.411
- Wait a minute.
- I knew it. I knew you'd say yes.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.455
Thank God
because I already paid in advance.

02:42.622 --> 02:44.582
- Don't you dare go changing your mind.
- What?

02:44.749 --> 02:46.626
Got your tie. Same colour as my bag.

02:46.793 --> 02:48.795
- Can we talk about it?
- Let's have a picture.

02:48.962 --> 02:51.089
- Just gonna go and get Dad.
- No, don't get Dad.

02:51.256 --> 02:53.341
Mum, leave him. He's fine.

02:53.508 --> 02:55.552
It's all right.

02:55.718 --> 02:57.887
<i>Good manners, good looks...</i>

02:58.513 --> 03:00.390
<i>...and good breeding.</i>

03:01.766 --> 03:03.309
Mikey!

03:03.476 --> 03:06.187
- Yes, Mrs Wallace?
- Put your arm around Dad.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.106
Can you take a picture, love?

03:08.273 --> 03:10.900
<i>- At Slaughterhouse, you will find...</i>
- He'd be proud of you.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.547
<i>...a family that is ready to fight...</i>

03:12.652 --> 03:14.404
Come on, smile, you posh bastard.

03:14.571 --> 03:15.947
<i>...until the bloody end.</i>

03:16.114 --> 03:19.284
<i>Cry</i> "Per caedes ad astra."

04:10.877 --> 04:13.254

04:13.421 --> 04:16.423
Mum! Dad!

04:17.091 --> 04:20.094
Love, I know it's been tough
with your dad gone.

04:20.511 --> 04:21.930

04:22.096 --> 04:23.598
The worst is over.

04:23.765 --> 04:24.974
Look.

04:25.141 --> 04:28.478
You're going to school

05:27.870 --> 05:31.749
I have someone I'd like you to meet.
Come in, Don.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.795
This is your new study
and Willoughby, your new roommate.

05:35.962 --> 05:38.881
Will, this is Don Wallace,
our new Spartan.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.258
Welcome to hell.

05:40.675 --> 05:42.844
- Dab of snuff?
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:44.554 --> 05:47.932
Will's a bit of a legend in Sparta.
Takes one to know one, eh?

05:48.808 --> 05:51.728
Will's part of a long line of Spartans
that really left their mark.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.314
This is your desk where you shall be
spending many a happy hour...

05:55.481 --> 05:57.859
...studying away like a little beaver.

05:58.026 --> 06:00.278
Or looking out the window,
that's what I did. Ha-ha.

06:00.445 --> 06:03.239
Um, you got your schoolbook?
That's got everything in there.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.075
Maps, school history,
secret tunnels and whatnot.

06:06.242 --> 06:09.829
Ooh! Bloody heck. Says "Viscount."

06:09.996 --> 06:12.040
Viscount Seymour.

06:12.206 --> 06:16.419
- Is that you, lovey, you a viscount?
- No. No, that boy is, um...

06:16.961 --> 06:19.589
...no longer with us, unfortunately.

06:19.756 --> 06:22.759
Damn it, I thought I gave you orders
to clear out Seymour's stuff.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.178
How much of it is left?

06:25.595 --> 06:28.306
Right, well, um, ahem,
if you'll excuse me...

06:28.473 --> 06:32.226
...uh, I should... Need to have
a word with Matron. Ahem.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.524
So did you know him, the viscount?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.735
He was my roommate.

06:40.902 --> 06:44.280
- Why'd he leave?
- I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.532
But you'll find out soon enough.

06:49.535 --> 06:53.664
Right, well, I'll let you get settled in.
It's very nice to meet you, Will.

06:53.831 --> 06:56.584
I have a feeling you two are gonna
get on like a house on fire.

06:57.168 --> 06:59.754
Remember what I said, Don.

07:05.134 --> 07:06.594
Well, then.

07:06.761 --> 07:09.639
Here you are,
two years stuck in a box.

07:09.806 --> 07:11.390
With me.

07:27.365 --> 07:29.617
Sparta dogs, assembly.

07:29.784 --> 07:32.203
Come on. God's sake, Wootton.

07:32.370 --> 07:36.874
Now, keep it moving at the back.
Heads down, say nothing to anyone.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.627
<i>You go in there
with your head held high...</i>

07:39.794 --> 07:42.380
<i>...and just be yourself.</i>

07:43.464 --> 07:45.133
<i>You belong here.</i>

07:45.299 --> 07:48.386
<i>And don't let anyone tell you
otherwise.</i>

08:18.875 --> 08:20.168
Excuse me.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.587
You dropped this.

08:23.087 --> 08:25.173
Oh. Thanks.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.841
What are those, selfies?

08:30.303 --> 08:32.554
I don't think you belong here, do you?

08:33.931 --> 08:35.892
- Sorry?
- You're standing in the girls' house.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.309
Oh.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.270
Oh, yeah, uh...

08:39.645 --> 08:42.481
- Sorry, I didn't realise.
- Everyone stands in their houses.

08:42.648 --> 08:45.985
This is Andromeda.
It's the newest house, just for girls.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.030
That's Xenephon,
it's full of scholars and brain boxes.

08:49.197 --> 08:53.201
All super smart, but none of them
can beat my friend Kay at chess.

08:54.535 --> 08:57.121
Olympus is all jocks
and rugger buggers.

08:57.288 --> 08:59.081
The school's superstars.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.709
And then there's Sparta.

09:01.876 --> 09:04.795
Which is... Well, it's...

09:05.379 --> 09:06.631
Um...

09:07.924 --> 09:09.175
I think that's you.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.969
Yeah, thanks.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.063
What the hell are you doing?

09:22.230 --> 09:24.982
- Me? I was just...
- Talking to Upper Sixth?

09:25.733 --> 09:27.985
- Upper Six... Who's Upper Sixth?
- I am.

09:28.152 --> 09:30.780
Matthew Clegg, and so is she.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.658
She's Matthew Clegg?

09:33.824 --> 09:36.160
Ha-ha. No, no.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.413
You don't look at Upper Sixth,
let alone speak to them.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.540
- I mean, I was just...
- You're speaking.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.251
And looking.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.460
Good.

09:45.461 --> 09:49.006
Now keep your eyes on the floor,
and go and stand with your house.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.925
Order.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.177
Thank you.

09:53.344 --> 09:54.637
Thank you.

09:54.804 --> 09:55.972
Oh, dear.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.765
You've upset Cleggy.

09:58.683 --> 10:00.309
That's not a good start.

10:01.269 --> 10:03.646
Comes from a long line
of war criminals.

10:03.813 --> 10:06.440
...will not be excused from games.
- Slacker.

10:06.607 --> 10:07.942
Now, listen up.

10:08.109 --> 10:10.611
- Caspar de Brunose. Head of school.
- Comes from the top.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.906
Till further notice, bathing in the lakes
is strictly forbidden...

10:14.073 --> 10:17.660
...and the woods are completely
out of bounds...

10:17.827 --> 10:21.956
...to all those who do not wish
to suffer a slow and painful death.

10:25.835 --> 10:28.671
<i>You have no new messages.</i>

10:28.838 --> 10:31.048
<i>Repeat saved message.</i>

10:31.215 --> 10:33.551
<i>Hey, it's Audrey. I'm in Africa.</i>

10:34.343 --> 10:38.889
<i>And guess what I just found in
my suitcase. Your old cricket jumper.</i>

10:39.056 --> 10:41.559
<i>Sweetie, it even smells of you.</i>

10:41.726 --> 10:46.188
<i>Chin up, okay? Stay strong,
this is gonna be a great year for you.</i>

10:46.355 --> 10:48.441
<i>- A great year.
- Silence!</i>

10:48.816 --> 10:50.568
For the head.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.500
What's all this?

11:06.876 --> 11:10.504
This is The Bat.

11:15.426 --> 11:16.761
Boys...

11:17.219 --> 11:18.387
...welcome.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.889
Welcome back.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.144
And girls, of course. Of course.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.188
Welcome all...

11:27.355 --> 11:29.357
...back to Slaughterhouse.

11:29.523 --> 11:33.152
Our school is home from home.

11:33.319 --> 11:35.613
Now, when I arrived last year...

11:35.780 --> 11:38.324
...I promised to shake things up a bit.

11:38.491 --> 11:43.788
Get Slaughterhouse back on track,
make our school great again.

11:43.954 --> 11:47.458
A family of proud Slaughterians.

11:47.625 --> 11:51.837
Don't forget,
I once stood where you are now.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.422
Long ago.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.758
- In a galaxy far, far away.
- Heh.

11:55.925 --> 11:59.553
There are those out there
who would like to see us fail.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.264
Oh, yes. We know about them.

12:02.431 --> 12:05.267
Their lies, their gossip...

12:05.434 --> 12:06.602
...their envy.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.020
But I say...

12:08.938 --> 12:09.939
...bring it on!

12:10.106 --> 12:13.776
We'll show them what we're made of.
We'll show them our guts.

12:13.943 --> 12:16.654
Cry <i>"Per caedes ad astra."</i>

12:16.821 --> 12:18.447
Through slaughter...

12:18.614 --> 12:20.408
...to immortality!

12:20.574 --> 12:22.451
Three cheers for the head.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.996
Hip, hip, hooray. Hip, hip, hooray.
Hip, hip, hooray.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.040
<i>Sweetie, it even smells of you.</i>

12:28.666 --> 12:33.712
<i>Chin up, okay? Stay strong,
this is gonna be a great year for you.</i>

12:39.718 --> 12:41.512
What the devil?

12:42.471 --> 12:45.683
Frack attack! Danger, toxic gas!
Clear the area.

12:45.850 --> 12:48.936
Smell the gas, smell the bullshit.

12:49.103 --> 12:51.021
Tell us what's going on in the woods.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.315
Why are you shitting
on your own doorstep?

12:53.482 --> 12:57.153
- Eco Doomsday. Take a leaflet.
- Out you go. You.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.988
...contaminating this whole area.

12:59.155 --> 13:00.448
- Hey, get off.
- This is genius.

13:01.699 --> 13:03.576
- Is this Woody's idea?
- I'm just a messenger.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.703
Wake up! Your house is on fire!

13:05.870 --> 13:09.373
Who let the frackers into the school?
He did! And we know why.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.792
- Thank you, off you go.
- Back off. I'm not one of you.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.127
I don't need to take any...

13:13.294 --> 13:16.755
- ...of your public-schoolboy crap.
- Uh-oh.

13:20.843 --> 13:23.512
You dare assault a prefect!

13:29.977 --> 13:33.063
Well, there you have it.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.774
Our enemies are on the doorstep.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.819
- Holy shit.
- Lost, are we, sir?

13:39.487 --> 13:41.071
School's that way.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.199
Yes, I'm perfectly aware... Jesus.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.161
You're awfully bloody close,
aren't you?

13:47.328 --> 13:50.706
- You're practically on the cricket pitch.
- Get your pads on, then, boss.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.584
Woods are out of bounds
from the start of term.

13:53.751 --> 13:56.754
This fracking tower is now
fully operational.

13:56.921 --> 14:01.258
Yes. Yes, I knew about the fracking,
I just didn't expect it to be so big.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.928
That's what all the girls say,
isn't it, lads?

14:05.304 --> 14:08.390
- Yes, he did. Yes, he did.
- Carry on. Ahem.

14:08.641 --> 14:12.478
- Tea break's over, lads.
- Let's make some money.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.738
Energy production will always
be contentious.

14:22.905 --> 14:23.948
But fracking...

14:24.114 --> 14:25.658
...is the future, and...

14:28.744 --> 14:31.747
And thanks
to the wonders of shale gas...

14:31.914 --> 14:35.167
...which exists in abundance
beneath our school...

14:35.334 --> 14:38.420
...we can finally build
our dry ski slope...

14:38.587 --> 14:40.422
...and the long overdue...

14:40.589 --> 14:42.216
...prefect spa.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.266
In the words of Emperor Caligula:

14:50.891 --> 14:52.268
"Let them hate."

14:52.434 --> 14:55.563
- Yes, quite.
- "So long as they fear us."

15:20.212 --> 15:23.382
- Oh! Meredith. I heard you were jogging.
- Yes.

15:23.549 --> 15:26.260
Didn't you get my note
about the no-go areas?

15:26.427 --> 15:29.388
Uh, yes, sorry about that, headmaster.

15:29.555 --> 15:33.434
My prefects have been instructed,
and the area's been locked down.

15:33.601 --> 15:34.727
Good, good.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.063
Now's not the time for the boys
to be slipping off to the old haunts.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.566
The woods, the lakes.

15:40.733 --> 15:43.652
Ciggies and tongue sandwiches.
That sort of thing.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.279
Perish the thought, headmaster.

15:45.446 --> 15:48.532
And how are things with you, Meredith?

15:48.699 --> 15:51.368
You seemed rather upset
taking Audrey to the airport.

15:51.535 --> 15:52.911
I was just, uh...

15:53.078 --> 15:55.873
...a bit sorry to see her go, headmaster.
Uh...

15:56.040 --> 15:58.000
She was quite a loss...

15:58.167 --> 16:00.002
...to the school.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.921
Don't sweat it, Meredith.

16:03.088 --> 16:07.343
You had a school romance,
delicious while it lasts, but you know...

16:07.509 --> 16:10.804
...these things always end up
in a bloody mess.

16:10.971 --> 16:14.350
The only couple I know
still going strong are me and Mr Chips.

16:14.516 --> 16:18.270
Ha-ha-ha. Isn't that right, Chippy?

16:21.440 --> 16:24.568
Ha-ha-ha. Come on, Chippy!

16:24.735 --> 16:27.154
Let's get some fresh air.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.005
<i>Cleanup team to the Portaloos.</i>

16:45.172 --> 16:47.800
<i>That's cleanup team to the Portaloos.</i>

16:49.134 --> 16:50.344
Right.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.388
Talk to me.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.558
- What have you got?
- Some underground cave system.

16:57.059 --> 17:01.105
No wonder that bloody sinkhole
appeared, leads straight down there.

17:01.271 --> 17:05.442
I've checked the readings,
it's still full of gas.

17:05.943 --> 17:08.404
- Bingo.
- We've hit the mother lode.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.866
Send down the pipe and suck it up.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.993
- Pump. Ooh.
- Oh, baby.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.829
You know the drill.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.126
<i>Seismic observance on level G17.</i>

17:22.291 --> 17:24.086
Mr Lambert.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.297
There's something down there...

17:27.673 --> 17:29.675
...in them tunnels.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.052
Look.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.637
It's moving.

17:33.804 --> 17:37.099
Bollocks.
I wouldn't worry about that, Butler.

17:37.266 --> 17:38.934
Probably just some moles.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.687
Pump at will.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.035
Yeah, I was... I was just saying, I...

17:57.494 --> 17:59.621
I've made a terrible mistake.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.207
Audrey?

18:03.709 --> 18:04.752
Angel?

18:05.878 --> 18:07.379
- Audrey?
<i>- Meredith?</i>

18:07.546 --> 18:10.132
<i>- I'm listening.</i>
- I was just saying, I...

18:10.299 --> 18:12.718
- I should've come with you.
<i>- Oh, sweetie.</i>

18:12.885 --> 18:14.762
<i>Sparta needs you.</i>

18:14.928 --> 18:17.848
<i>After what happened last term.</i>

18:18.182 --> 18:20.726
- What was I thinking?
<i>- Come on.</i>

18:20.893 --> 18:22.227
<i>Hey.</i>

18:22.394 --> 18:24.146
<i>We had fun times.</i>

18:24.313 --> 18:28.609
<i>We had good times there,
but Sparta's your life, you know?</i>

18:28.776 --> 18:30.319
No, no.

18:30.486 --> 18:31.820
You're my life.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.823
My love, all I want is to be with you.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.368
<i>- In South Sudan?</i>
- If I can find a replacement coach...

18:38.535 --> 18:42.748
...for the under sixteens, then yes.
I'll buy a plane ticket.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.626
- Audrey?
<i>- Yeah. Okay. Ha-ha.</i>

18:45.793 --> 18:48.754
Is everything all right?
Who's...? Who's that?

18:50.547 --> 18:54.218
<i>That's Dr Francois, he wants me...
Needs me to assist him.</i>

18:54.384 --> 18:57.429
<i>That's all we do here.
We're at it all day long.</i>

18:57.596 --> 18:59.348
<i>Nonstop. Ha-ha.</i>

19:00.182 --> 19:02.100
Saving children?

19:02.267 --> 19:04.478
<i>It's so deeply fulfilling.</i>

19:08.106 --> 19:12.361
<i>Yeah, sorry, sweetie, that's, um... Rebel
fighters must be back. I have to go.</i>

19:12.528 --> 19:15.030
Audrey, please, don't go.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.827
Mr Houseman, sir, you're needed.

19:20.410 --> 19:23.497
Keep still, you little bugger.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.419
Why did Miss Audrey leave?

19:36.927 --> 19:39.763
You're not going
to get a hard-on to that.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.100
In my kingdom, we banned fracking.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.477
- Can poison all the water.
- Also causes earthquakes.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.604
- Earthquakes?
- And sinkholes.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.482
Says here that there were 600
earthquakes in Oklahoma last year.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.902
Good. Hopefully
the fucking school will fall down.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.113
Lights in 10.

19:56.655 --> 20:00.909
All right, Chibwe, that's confiscated.
No electronic devices in the dorm.

20:01.076 --> 20:04.663
- You, whatever your name is, into bed.
- Yes, sir. It's Wallace.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.206
As in William.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.583
As in <i>Braveheart.</i>

20:07.749 --> 20:09.126
Blake, explain to me.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.422
Why are you such a fucking ponce?

20:13.589 --> 20:15.173
You don't even play rugby.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.635
"Never touch the balls," it's my motto.

20:18.802 --> 20:19.887
Besides...

20:21.555 --> 20:24.391
- ...I'm unwell.
- Sick note. How did you get that?

20:24.558 --> 20:26.977
- Suck off the doctor?
- It was only a handjob.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.479
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Sparta!

20:29.646 --> 20:31.982
Stop what you're doing,
house meeting now.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.567
Move it.

20:33.734 --> 20:36.737
Whose idea of a sick joke was this?

20:36.904 --> 20:37.905
Hmm?

20:38.447 --> 20:41.199
Somebody hung this tie from a beam
in the downstairs lavatory...

20:41.366 --> 20:44.995
...and I want to know
who the heck it was.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.415
You think this is funny,
do you, Hargreaves?

20:48.582 --> 20:50.834
Well, I find it deeply offensive.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.419
Really.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.672
Who could do such a thing?
Come on, own up.

20:55.839 --> 20:58.050
I want to know who it was.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.720
Was it you? You?

21:03.055 --> 21:04.348
Well, I am most upset.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.267
And I'm very disappointed.

21:12.606 --> 21:17.569
I hope this doesn't cast a shadow over
the whole house, Sparta, I really do.

21:18.070 --> 21:21.406
If anybody knows
anything about this...

21:21.573 --> 21:23.575
...they better come forward.

21:29.164 --> 21:33.377
- Head back to your dormitories. Now.
- Lights out in three minutes.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.545
What's all that about?

21:38.215 --> 21:40.384
The boy who had your bed.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.302
Viscount?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.972
He died last term.

21:45.806 --> 21:49.726
Hung himself in the downstairs bogs
with a school tie.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.689
Welcome to Slaughterhouse.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.158
- Lights out!
- Lights out! Lights!

22:05.325 --> 22:06.451
- Lights out.
- Lights out.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.538
No running in the corridor!

22:15.127 --> 22:17.337
<i>He's watching over you, Don.</i>

22:17.504 --> 22:19.589
<i>You should take comfort in that.</i>

22:19.756 --> 22:22.926
Don't forget how hard
Dad worked to get us here.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.553
This was his dream.

22:25.262 --> 22:29.975
Life's gonna get better from now.
But you've got to believe that.

22:30.475 --> 22:32.894
You do believe that, don't you?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.104
<i>Don?</i>

22:35.564 --> 22:37.774
Don? Mr Wallace.

22:38.233 --> 22:39.609
Are you with us?

22:39.776 --> 22:40.944
Splendid.

22:41.111 --> 22:44.698
Class, I'm afraid Mr Prigg will be
unable to teach Latin today...

22:44.865 --> 22:46.950
...or indeed, ever again...

22:47.367 --> 22:50.412
...because he passed away
in the holidays.

22:50.579 --> 22:51.997
He died here.

22:52.164 --> 22:53.874
Alone.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.334
But it was a good innings.

22:56.501 --> 23:00.797
Uh, I will be filling his shoes until
they can find a suitable replacement.

23:00.964 --> 23:04.885
Now, I have to confess, I'm not
the world's greatest Latin scholar.

23:05.052 --> 23:09.556
It's been a while, but, uh,
tempus fugit, as they say. Um...

23:13.226 --> 23:16.438
- Page 108, sir.
- Yes, yes.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.818
- By the power of witches?
- Yes. Why don't you read, Bartlett?

23:22.360 --> 23:24.112
"At that moment, as I recall...

23:24.279 --> 23:27.115
...the earth yawned open
by the power of witchcraft."

23:28.450 --> 23:29.890
Name three famous old Slaughterians.

23:29.951 --> 23:33.330
Marquis de Sade,
Jack the Ripper, Piers Morgan.

23:33.497 --> 23:35.499
- Don't piss about, Wootton.
- Sorry, Hargreaves!

23:35.665 --> 23:38.043
- When was Slaughter Hall built?
- 1770.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.045
No, that's the year
the school was founded.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.672
The original hall was built in 1334.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.382
- Fuck this.
- School motto.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.510
<i>- "Per caedes ad astra."</i>
- What does it mean?

23:46.676 --> 23:48.678
- "Never knowingly undersold"?
- Oh, you twat.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.972
"Take it like a man"?
"Give us your cash."

23:51.139 --> 23:54.059
- You had three weeks to learn this.
- Sorry, Hargreaves.

23:54.226 --> 23:56.311
If you're not word perfect
when Clegg tests you...

23:56.478 --> 23:59.147
...you're gonna get feathered
and we're both gonna get grounded.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.024
<i>"I caught a glimpse
of hell deep below.</i>

24:01.191 --> 24:03.068
And of Cerberus waiting
to make a meal of me."

24:03.235 --> 24:07.697
Ah, now, Cerberus,
the three-headed hound of Hades.

24:07.864 --> 24:10.117
Makes life hell for the postman. Ha-ha.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.246
Get on with it, Bartlett.

24:15.372 --> 24:17.249
It's all there in the school myth.

24:17.415 --> 24:21.002
Legend has it that a wandering knight
returned from the Crusades...

24:21.169 --> 24:24.631
...and with the help of his faithful dog,
slayed a mythical beast...

24:24.798 --> 24:27.300
...that was terrorizing the village
of Upper Slaughter.

24:27.467 --> 24:32.305
<i>In return, he was gifted this land
and the title First Earl of Slaughter.</i>

24:32.472 --> 24:36.184
<i>- Hence the motto...</i>
- "Through slaughter to immorality."

24:38.562 --> 24:40.105
Immortality.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.566
"I believe the witch
did not spare my throat in pity...

24:42.732 --> 24:45.235
...but in a spirit of sadism."

24:48.780 --> 24:50.574
Preparing to evacuate.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.367
Hopefully.

24:54.995 --> 25:00.083
"... Whom thou didst falsely
affirm to be slain by me this night.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.002
And therewithal...

25:02.419 --> 25:06.298
...I embraced my friend, Socrates,
and kissed him.

25:06.464 --> 25:10.552
But he, smelling the stink
of the pissing..."

25:11.219 --> 25:14.222
What's the point in learning
a dead language anyway?

25:14.389 --> 25:17.559
Hey, Will, who was the blond girl
in the tennis gear outside?

25:18.226 --> 25:20.103
- I met her yesterday.
- She's a goddess.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.397
She's fit is what she is.
What's her name?

25:23.273 --> 25:24.649
Clemsie.

25:24.816 --> 25:26.193
Clemsie Lawrence.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.236
- But it's not worth it.
- Why not?

25:28.445 --> 25:30.238
- Aah!
- Oh, no.

25:30.405 --> 25:31.573
How unfortunate.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.742
Total accident.

25:33.909 --> 25:36.453
Next time, watch where you're looking.

25:39.289 --> 25:43.627
I don't think it's bust, just mashed.
Heh.

25:43.793 --> 25:44.878
I'm Smudger.

25:45.045 --> 25:47.214
No hard feelings, yeah?

25:47.380 --> 25:49.883
Coolio. Wait till you're a god.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.680
Look. This is the school pecking order.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.516
We have Clemsie Lawrence
drinking nectar...

25:58.683 --> 26:00.685
...with the gods at the Arcadian orgy.

26:01.311 --> 26:02.896
And then down...

26:04.564 --> 26:07.359
...at the bottom in hell,
you have Wootton.

26:07.525 --> 26:09.361
- Who's Wootton?
- That's Wootton.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.031
- Hello.
- You all right?

26:13.198 --> 26:15.992
You have gods and dogs,
heaven and hell.

26:16.159 --> 26:19.663
And somewhere in the middle,
we have...

26:19.829 --> 26:21.414
Why am I a limp cock?

26:21.581 --> 26:25.085
Because, Ducky, someday,
you may well be a god.

26:25.252 --> 26:29.756
- Until then, you have to wait your turn.
- No, no, no. This is bollocks, mate.

26:29.923 --> 26:31.049
Bollocks. I'm in love.

26:32.884 --> 26:37.138
You guys can laugh,
but I ain't part of your pecking order.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.932
<i>One of us. One of us.</i>

26:39.099 --> 26:41.810
Everybody says that.
They all sell out by the Upper Sixth.

26:41.977 --> 26:43.270
Think of the orgies.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.606
- Yuri, this Sixth Form orgy is a myth.
- But I must have hope.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.942
Wallace, you want to take
Clemsie Lawrence to orgy...

26:49.109 --> 26:51.152
...practise your Latin conjugations.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.246
Ah.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.456
A penis.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.208
I wonder who drew that.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.839
What were you talking about in here?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.466
- Nothing.
- Well, excuse me...

27:13.633 --> 27:15.093
Wallace.

27:15.260 --> 27:20.265
Cocky little shit thinks he's got
a chance with Clemsie Lawrence.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.893
Honestly, Matt, we were just...

27:24.060 --> 27:25.645
Sanctions.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.772
All week, starting tomorrow at 5 a.m.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.817
And don't thank me.
Thank Wallace here.

27:30.984 --> 27:32.193
Everybody out.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.113
Stop loafing around. This is a school,
not a fucking holiday camp.

27:36.531 --> 27:40.452
Wootton, if you fail the house test
again, you will be feathered.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.705
All right. You're free to go.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.546
Audrey!

27:52.422 --> 27:55.592
<i>Good morning, Gloucestershire.</i>

27:55.759 --> 27:57.510
<i>And got a request now.</i>

27:58.595 --> 28:01.639
Move it, gentlemen! Keep up the pace.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.937
Blake, keep running!

28:08.104 --> 28:10.940
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

28:12.067 --> 28:13.651
Jump it. Jump it.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.320
Jump it.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.364
What the fuck is that?!

28:30.460 --> 28:33.004
Well, are you enjoying it?

28:33.338 --> 28:37.258
Are you enjoying the privilege
of your private school education?

28:38.718 --> 28:42.680
Five generations of Cleggs have given
their lives to places like this.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.516
Fucking plebeian.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.851
Trying to buy your way in.

28:48.686 --> 28:52.857
The only connection you'll make
around here is with my boot.

28:53.858 --> 28:56.152
Blake, stop fucking mincing!

28:57.862 --> 28:59.447
Get him out, Wallace.

28:59.614 --> 29:02.283
- What?
- Your roommate, your problem.

29:03.201 --> 29:05.078
- Come on, Will.
- Chibwe, Bolotnikov.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.080
Top of the hill, then you can go.

29:07.247 --> 29:09.290
Come on. One mile back to school.

29:09.457 --> 29:12.877
Breakfast ends in 20 minutes.
Good luck with that one, Wallace.

29:13.503 --> 29:14.712
Hup, hup, hup!

29:15.296 --> 29:16.881
Go, go, go!

29:17.048 --> 29:19.175
- Hey.
- Over the bridge!

29:25.306 --> 29:26.641
Christ. Is that you?

29:27.892 --> 29:30.812
No. It's the school tunnels.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.647
Whole world of shit down there.

29:32.814 --> 29:35.567
- Yeah, it smells like it.
- You still hungry?

29:35.733 --> 29:36.901
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

29:37.068 --> 29:39.070
I know a shortcut.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.655
It's through the woods.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.618
You call this a shortcut?

29:45.785 --> 29:47.245
This place is massive.

29:48.955 --> 29:52.459
Whose idea was it to have a school
in the middle of bum-fuck nowhere?

29:52.625 --> 29:56.421
Um... The parents, probably.

29:58.756 --> 30:02.719
- Admit it. You're lost, aren't you?
- Now, now, Ducky, I'm not lost.

30:02.886 --> 30:05.138
Would you stop calling me "Ducky"?

30:05.305 --> 30:08.308
- Your name is Donald.
- I don't care if my name's Daffy.

30:13.396 --> 30:15.565
Shit. It's the frackers. Hide.

30:25.116 --> 30:26.326
Hey.

30:26.493 --> 30:27.952
Look at this.

30:37.545 --> 30:39.255
A sinkhole.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.049
Damn.

30:41.424 --> 30:44.177
Why didn't this happen
under the maths block?

30:44.594 --> 30:45.595
Oh!

30:46.930 --> 30:48.056
Intruder alert.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.433
A couple of posh little fuckers.

30:54.437 --> 30:56.064
Let's see.

30:57.398 --> 30:58.566
Let's see how deep it is.

31:10.453 --> 31:11.829
- Christ, mate.
- Fuck me.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.331
It's that smell again.

31:13.831 --> 31:16.042
Oh, that ain't no drain.

31:16.209 --> 31:17.752
No shite smells that bad.

31:18.586 --> 31:19.921
Look at this.

31:20.088 --> 31:22.715
- Must be some sort of evil gas.
- Put it away.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.968
- That's mine.
- I don't care. There's gas there.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.595
- Give it back.
- You're gonna get us killed, Willoughby!

31:28.012 --> 31:29.597
Shall we?

31:29.764 --> 31:32.600
Oh, you're a bad man.

31:32.767 --> 31:35.436
That's why they pay me the big bucks.

31:36.396 --> 31:39.857
I'm not kidding.
Someone bequeathed that to me.

31:40.316 --> 31:42.777
- What?
- It was a gift...

31:42.944 --> 31:44.612
...from a good friend. Give it back...

31:46.406 --> 31:48.074
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

31:48.908 --> 31:50.326
<i>We have you surrounded.</i>

31:52.620 --> 31:55.415
Do not try to escape.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.127
Run!

32:21.774 --> 32:23.693
I thought you were sick.

32:23.860 --> 32:27.572
- You run like a bloody gazelle.
- With asthma.

32:28.865 --> 32:31.034
- I think we're safe.
- What are you doing here?

32:33.828 --> 32:36.539
I'm sorry.
Did the mask of truth frighten you?

32:36.706 --> 32:38.750
It does that sometimes.

32:41.169 --> 32:43.546
You the boys that want
to buy some drugs?

32:44.964 --> 32:46.382
Huh?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.135
I've got some black ash.
I've got some charas.

32:49.302 --> 32:53.556
I've got some Mandy, ecstasy.
I've got some acid. I've got some...

32:53.931 --> 32:56.100
...mushrooms!

32:56.267 --> 32:57.518
Yeah!

32:58.936 --> 33:00.313
No, no. We're just, um...

33:00.480 --> 33:02.815
- Just like...
- Yeah, there's a hole.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.151
- It's a big hole.
- Fracking.

33:05.318 --> 33:06.527
- Fracking.
- Yeah.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.738
We're just seeing what they're up to.

33:08.905 --> 33:11.240
You were wondering
what they were up to.

33:11.407 --> 33:13.034
Wondering what they're up to.

33:13.201 --> 33:15.036
They were wondering
what they're up to.

33:16.454 --> 33:20.333
I'll tell you what they're up to, big boy.
They're unleashing hell.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.834
What do you mean?

33:22.001 --> 33:26.047
What do I mean?
What does thou mean?

33:26.881 --> 33:29.842
I'll tell you what I mean.
I mean, over there...

33:30.009 --> 33:32.428
...is a super-massive frack hole.

33:32.595 --> 33:35.473
And holes like that,
they don't open up for no reason.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.600
They're the product of evil men.

33:37.767 --> 33:40.311
Fracking Mother Nature.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.106
Pimping her, poisoning her.

33:43.272 --> 33:46.526
Pumping her
with their rock-hard, toxic cocks.

33:46.984 --> 33:49.529
People don't want it.
Farmers don't want it.

33:49.696 --> 33:51.781
The only people that do want it...

33:51.948 --> 33:56.994
...are the unelected imperialist elite
that is Terrafrack.

33:57.161 --> 33:59.497
- Yeah.
- Privileged pricks!

33:59.664 --> 34:02.208
We know what they are.
They're bullies.

34:02.375 --> 34:06.963
And what better place to learn bullying
than here at an English public school.

34:07.714 --> 34:10.382
The CEO of Terrafrack
and your headmaster...

34:11.050 --> 34:14.469
...they're school chums
from back in the day. Ooh!

34:14.637 --> 34:18.056
I don't think they knew.
They didn't know. See this?

34:18.725 --> 34:20.643
Old school tie.

34:20.810 --> 34:23.187
Yeah? Wake up.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.022
It's how the system works.

34:25.188 --> 34:29.610
I bet your dads know all about that.
What are they? A couple of bankers?

34:30.194 --> 34:32.447
No, come on. Tell us.
What are they in?

34:32.612 --> 34:34.449
Property? Hedge funds?

34:34.614 --> 34:35.992
- Insurance?
- Recycling.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.871
What?
You mean, like recycling waste?

34:40.036 --> 34:42.998
Yeah, he takes other people's shit
and turns it into cash.

34:43.166 --> 34:46.502
That's funny. Pretty sure
my old man does the exact opposite.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.880
Oh, well, pity,
it's all going to shit in the end.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.759
Shit we'll end up eating. Ha-ha.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.555
This ain't a fucking joke, boys.

34:57.847 --> 35:02.810
Huh? We are all gonna eat karma
for this. Join the dots.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.729
Wars.

35:04.896 --> 35:06.522
Droughts.

35:06.689 --> 35:08.149
Famine.

35:08.316 --> 35:09.609
Plague.

35:10.359 --> 35:11.819
That's why we're here.

35:11.986 --> 35:14.405
- Yeah!
- Knee-deep in shit.

35:14.572 --> 35:16.699
- Yeah!
- No flushing latrine.

35:16.866 --> 35:19.368
- Yeah!
- Don't cheer that one.

35:19.535 --> 35:24.207
Because we know that hole,
it ain't no mundane chasm.

35:24.373 --> 35:26.292
It's a portal.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.461
A gateway.

35:28.628 --> 35:33.049
It leads straight down to hell.

35:34.592 --> 35:37.303
Now, who wants to buy some drugs?

35:37.470 --> 35:39.180
Get them some drugs.

35:39.764 --> 35:43.434
We're all gonna die soon.
Go out with a bang. Kaboom!

36:46.706 --> 36:49.500
Hello? Is someone out of bed?

37:38.341 --> 37:40.426
This place is creeping me out.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.178
- I'm suffocating.
<i>- Don't be daft.</i>

37:42.345 --> 37:43.387
<i>You're overemotional.</i>

37:43.554 --> 37:45.765
I'm not being overemotional.
I'm tired, all right?

37:45.932 --> 37:49.018
- I haven't slept in fucking weeks.
<i>- All right, Don. Calm down.</i>

37:49.185 --> 37:52.104
<i>You're coming home this weekend.
We can talk about it then.</i>

37:52.271 --> 37:53.564
<i>And you can always text me.</i>

37:53.731 --> 37:55.942
I can't text
because this prefect's taken my phone.

37:56.484 --> 37:57.735
What do you mean, your phone?

37:57.902 --> 37:59.278
Mum...

38:00.071 --> 38:01.405
Sorry.

38:01.572 --> 38:04.825
- I let you and Dad down, I know.
<i>- You did not let Dad down or me.</i>

38:04.992 --> 38:06.577
I don't belong here.

38:06.744 --> 38:07.912
<i>Of course, you do.</i>

38:08.079 --> 38:09.956
I wanna come home now.

38:10.247 --> 38:12.375
- Do you fucking mind?!
- Oh!

38:12.541 --> 38:14.752
Sorry. We thought
you were someone else.

38:14.919 --> 38:16.545
Calling child helpline?

38:16.712 --> 38:17.797
<i>Don?</i>

38:17.964 --> 38:20.007
<i>- Don? Don?</i>
- No, no. It's my mum.

38:20.174 --> 38:22.385
- She misses me.
<i>- Don, what's going on?</i>

38:22.551 --> 38:24.553
<i>- Speak to me.</i>
- I told you, Mum. No.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.555
- I'm fine, all right?
<i>- What?</i>

38:26.722 --> 38:29.016
- I'm fine. I'll see you soon.
<i>- You weren't fine.</i>

38:29.183 --> 38:32.019
<i>- Don, don't... No, no.</i>
- Bye, bye.

38:33.020 --> 38:35.272
She's, uh, worried about me,
you know?

38:35.439 --> 38:38.776
Keep telling her to chill out,
but apparently it's much worse at Eton.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.280
Well, sorry we interrupted you.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.033
Why don't you come with us?
We're going to smokers' corner.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.245
But, um, we haven't got a light.

38:49.912 --> 38:50.997
Uh...

38:52.373 --> 38:53.582
Yeah.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.377
Ladies, lead the way.

39:10.808 --> 39:12.768
Ah. Ahem.

39:12.935 --> 39:14.687
I was just, uh...

39:15.104 --> 39:16.772
Amazing grass.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.190
Yeah.

39:18.357 --> 39:22.403
Yes, the, uh... The cricket pitch,
just cut to perfection.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.655
Good job, lads.

39:32.747 --> 39:34.957
Fucking fascists.

39:36.584 --> 39:38.002
This is smokers' corner?

39:40.713 --> 39:43.049
Beats the back of the bike sheds, this,
doesn't it?

39:43.215 --> 39:45.342
No wonder everyone here smokes.

39:45.509 --> 39:47.636
You're so northern.

39:48.846 --> 39:50.222
It's true, though, isn't it?

39:50.389 --> 39:54.935
This is what our parents are really
paying for: nice buildings, traditions.

39:55.102 --> 39:58.272
Fucking prime ministers,
all that bollocks.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.024
It's a breeding ground.

40:01.192 --> 40:02.443
Breeding what?

40:02.610 --> 40:05.905
Think how many of our world leaders
spend their formative years like this.

40:07.031 --> 40:09.283
That is fucking scary.

40:12.870 --> 40:15.247
Some don't make it, though, do they?

40:15.873 --> 40:19.043
Like that viscount kid.
The one who hung himself.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.753
Oh, yeah.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.671
Seymour.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.383
I think he got badly bullied.

40:26.550 --> 40:30.179
A hard time being gay.
Got on the wrong side of Matty Clegg.

40:30.346 --> 40:32.014
Why? What happened?

40:32.181 --> 40:36.102
Matty caught him and
another boy in the boathouse after dark.

40:36.936 --> 40:39.105
Clegg told the parents.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.065
Bastard.

40:42.399 --> 40:45.152
All got brushed under the carpet,
of course.

40:46.237 --> 40:48.948
Everyone says, "Just be yourself."

40:50.157 --> 40:52.660
But nobody tells you how hard it is.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.412
Especially around here.

40:56.872 --> 40:59.375
You seem to be doing all right, though.

41:00.084 --> 41:01.168
Always smiling.

41:03.838 --> 41:05.214
I am when I see you.

41:09.385 --> 41:11.011
Clemsie...

41:11.804 --> 41:13.848
- ...I'm glad...
- You dare talk to a Sixth Former?

41:14.014 --> 41:15.307
- Fucking hell.
- Oh, my God.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.226
Having a cheeky fag, are we?

41:17.393 --> 41:19.562
Where was my invite?

41:19.728 --> 41:21.021
And, Don...

41:21.188 --> 41:22.439
...where's my lighter?

41:24.733 --> 41:27.945
Clegg! Clegg! He's on the warpath
with his cadets.

41:28.112 --> 41:30.698
- Cadets? What?
- Run, run, run. Go!

41:30.865 --> 41:33.868
- Who's got a ciggie?
- Not now, Smudge. Go, go.

41:37.454 --> 41:38.497
Halt!

41:38.664 --> 41:40.207
Halt!

41:42.585 --> 41:43.711
Look out!

41:44.128 --> 41:46.046
We know you've been smoking.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.465
- Empty your pockets.
- Run!

41:54.221 --> 41:55.598
Fuck.

42:00.019 --> 42:01.270
Bang.

42:25.753 --> 42:27.296
Shall I get that, boss?

42:27.463 --> 42:29.882
No. It'll only be the headmaster.

42:30.049 --> 42:31.884
Fussing about the methane leak.

42:32.051 --> 42:33.135
Methane leak?

42:35.888 --> 42:37.681
That's a methane leak.

42:37.848 --> 42:39.516
Asshole.

42:41.602 --> 42:44.730
Yes, uh, and you're quite sure
there's no danger?

42:44.897 --> 42:46.106
Very good, very good.

42:46.649 --> 42:50.110
Even so, I'd like to voice
my concerns with your superior.

42:53.030 --> 42:56.325
Yeah, well, please do ask him
to give me a call.

42:57.493 --> 42:58.994
Here.

42:59.536 --> 43:03.457
He's very protective of me.
Aren't you, Mr Chips?

43:03.624 --> 43:06.460
The authorities, headmaster,
they, uh, been able to shed any light?

43:06.627 --> 43:09.129
It's nothing. Simple gas leak.

43:09.296 --> 43:11.048
- Thank goodness.
- Yes, thank goodness.

43:11.215 --> 43:15.094
- A gas leak? Sounds rather...
- Just a small one, Meredith.

43:15.261 --> 43:18.097
- Nothing to worry about.
- It was a lake of fire.

43:18.264 --> 43:21.809
Yes, well, uh, that is the methane,
you see...

43:22.142 --> 43:24.395
...uh, leaking...

43:24.561 --> 43:26.522
...out of the ground.

43:27.856 --> 43:31.277
Ahem. The chaps at Terrafrack say
it's all quite normal.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.028
And they are the experts, after all.

43:34.363 --> 43:36.031
What is it now, Tomkinson?

43:38.784 --> 43:41.537
Another champagne hamper, sir,
from Terrafrack.

43:41.704 --> 43:43.872
Thank you, Tomkinson. Thank you.

43:44.415 --> 43:46.458
So this is all fracking related?

43:46.625 --> 43:50.087
Meredith, the substructure
of Slaughter Hall...

43:50.254 --> 43:52.798
...is hundreds of years old.

43:52.965 --> 43:56.302
I mean, we have
some very leaky drains here...

43:56.468 --> 43:57.928
...very old tunnels.

43:58.429 --> 44:00.306
Ancient, in fact.

44:00.472 --> 44:02.141
- Speaking of Matron.
- Ha-ha.

44:02.308 --> 44:05.019
- Ha-ha.
- This took us a bit by surprise is all.

44:05.185 --> 44:10.065
Look, it is rather concerning,
headmaster, don't you agree?

44:10.816 --> 44:12.318
Yes.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.695
Yes, it is.

44:14.862 --> 44:17.656
Which is all the more reason why I...

44:17.823 --> 44:21.827
I cannot have boys smoking
in such a potentially...

44:21.994 --> 44:24.705
...highly-flammable environment.
I mean, ooh.

44:26.999 --> 44:31.795
Ah. I must take this, headmaster,
if you don't mind. It's rather urgent.

44:31.962 --> 44:34.548
Audrey, darling. I can hear you,
but I can't see you.

44:35.090 --> 44:38.552
Out of his league.
Now, look, boys, boys, boys.

44:38.719 --> 44:41.180
You're both too young, too bright...

44:41.347 --> 44:43.849
...and quite frankly,
too darn handsome...

44:44.391 --> 44:48.771
...to be polluting your bodies
in such a reckless fashion.

44:48.937 --> 44:53.108
I don't want to start thrashing pupils
like it's the good old days.

44:53.525 --> 44:55.861
But it's clear to me
that you do need some correcting.

44:56.028 --> 44:58.238
I am going to telephone your parents...

44:58.405 --> 45:00.532
...and ask that you not
return home tomorrow...

45:00.699 --> 45:03.160
...for the Exeat Weekend.
Instead, you will remain here...

45:03.327 --> 45:05.204
...and perform sanctions
with your house god.

45:05.371 --> 45:07.915
- Who's at Sparta this weekend?
- I am, sir.

45:08.082 --> 45:10.334
Mm. Good. Well, now...

45:10.501 --> 45:12.169
...try and use this as a...

45:12.336 --> 45:13.921
- Bello, what's up?
- What's up?

45:14.088 --> 45:16.465
Bello. Cool.

45:17.549 --> 45:19.343
Two more names to go on there.

45:19.510 --> 45:21.178
Blake, Wallace.

45:21.345 --> 45:24.932
Tomorrow morning, 5 a.m.
In your games kit. Be prepared.

45:35.943 --> 45:37.486
Clemsie, you're Upper Sixth.

45:37.653 --> 45:40.030
You can't be seen talking to Blake
and his oiky roommate.

45:40.197 --> 45:42.533
I'll speak to whom I bloody well like.

45:42.699 --> 45:46.787
- This place is a joke.
- I'll be a joke if the chaps hear about it.

45:47.704 --> 45:50.207
I'm being made a god.

45:51.125 --> 45:53.836
I've been dreaming about this weekend
ever since I got here.

45:54.837 --> 45:56.839
- What's up, Woots?
- Hello.

45:57.005 --> 46:00.259
- Did you pass the test yet?
- What does it look like?

46:01.135 --> 46:03.345
Look, Clemsie.

46:03.512 --> 46:07.307
I need you there by my side
when I'm anointed by the head boy.

46:07.474 --> 46:11.270
It's not my scene, a bunch
of dickheads wanking each other off.

46:11.437 --> 46:12.855
This is your night.

46:13.397 --> 46:15.774
Smudge. Look.

46:15.941 --> 46:17.734
Doesn't mean I don't love you.

46:22.406 --> 46:25.033
Ugh. Snuff.

46:26.827 --> 46:28.162
Cheer up, Ducky.

46:28.328 --> 46:30.205
I mean, it's not all that bad.

46:30.372 --> 46:31.748
At least you've got me.

46:31.915 --> 46:34.042
So not going home, then?

46:34.209 --> 46:37.588
We'd thought you'd be grounded.
Tough luck, boys.

46:37.754 --> 46:39.006
Going home for the weekend?

46:39.173 --> 46:42.342
To Hong Kong? Don't be ridiculous.
I'm in a chess tournament in Beijing.

46:42.759 --> 46:45.137
- Really? When?
- Five minutes. Better run.

46:45.762 --> 46:49.266
Hey, Don. You could always
hook up with Clemsie.

46:49.433 --> 46:50.893
- Clemsie?
- She's staying too.

46:53.437 --> 46:54.980
Oh, my God.

46:56.273 --> 46:57.441
She's here.

46:57.608 --> 47:01.320
A weekend alone in paradise
with Clemsie Lawrence.

47:01.737 --> 47:03.739
Come on, Ducky. Grow up.

47:04.156 --> 47:06.992
She's Clemsie Lawrence of Belgravia.

47:07.159 --> 47:08.452
Who the hell are you?

47:08.619 --> 47:11.038
- Thanks, mate.
- Just being honest.

47:11.205 --> 47:13.624
Good. It's about time, isn't it?

47:14.082 --> 47:16.502
You haven't told me nowt
about this place.

47:16.668 --> 47:20.964
You didn't even tell me Seymour
was bullied or why he hung himself.

47:21.131 --> 47:23.300
- That's none of your business.
- None of my business?

47:23.467 --> 47:25.469
I sleep in his fucking bed, Will.

47:25.636 --> 47:28.555
Someone died
and you act like you don't even care.

47:28.722 --> 47:30.432
You're supposed to be my roommate.

47:31.350 --> 47:32.434
Thanks a lot.

47:33.101 --> 47:35.437
No wonder he fucking topped himself.

47:37.564 --> 47:40.734
Go and do some snuff, you weirdo.

48:04.341 --> 48:07.177
I'm sorry I failed the test.
Please, Mummy.

48:07.344 --> 48:11.765
Let me come home. I promise not
to be a nuisance to you and Steve.

48:12.140 --> 48:13.767
No, please.

48:14.810 --> 48:16.228

49:34.848 --> 49:37.100
- I want to know. Own up.
- I think he was badly bullied.

49:37.267 --> 49:39.645
<i>- I think he was badly bullied.
- He was my roommate.</i>

49:39.811 --> 49:41.313

49:46.526 --> 49:47.903

- You'll find out soon enough.
<i>- You?</i>

50:03.251 --> 50:06.129
Oh. Fucking prick.

50:06.296 --> 50:08.256
Nearly bloody killed me.

50:09.091 --> 50:10.759
Oh, my...

50:12.469 --> 50:14.805
You're a bloody drama queen.
You know that?

50:15.514 --> 50:17.140
Oh, my...

50:21.061 --> 50:24.856
I'm sorry for what I said, mate.
All right? You're not that bad.

50:25.565 --> 50:28.068
- Life ain't that bad.
- Yes, it fucking is.

50:39.454 --> 50:42.040
Is that what you're leaving me?
Your snuff box?

50:42.207 --> 50:44.751
- Did you bequeath it to me?
- Ha-ha.

50:44.918 --> 50:47.879
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with that?

50:49.548 --> 50:52.968
You've got years of snorting tobacco
ahead of you. Years.

50:53.135 --> 50:55.512
All right? You're not him, Will.

50:55.679 --> 50:57.180
You're not Seymour.

50:57.347 --> 51:00.475
- He was all that I had.
- Yeah, but then rage, all right?

51:00.642 --> 51:02.060
Rage against the...

51:02.227 --> 51:03.979
- ...machine?
- Dying of the light.

51:04.146 --> 51:07.274
Whatever. The point is,
you've hit the bottom, all right?

51:07.441 --> 51:10.527
But you're on the way up.
Things can only get better.

51:10.694 --> 51:12.571
It can't get any darker now.

51:13.321 --> 51:15.490
Don't tell me
you've found someone else.

51:15.657 --> 51:16.992
<i>Meredith.</i>

51:17.159 --> 51:18.618
<i>You know I have.</i>

51:23.415 --> 51:25.292
<i>This is Ibrahim.</i>

51:25.459 --> 51:28.044
<i>How can I just leave him
and come back?</i>

51:28.211 --> 51:30.422
Well, can't you bring him with you?

51:31.339 --> 51:32.883
Hey, lb.

51:33.049 --> 51:35.218
Hello, little man.

51:35.385 --> 51:37.596
- Do you like cricket?
<i>- Meredith.</i>

51:54.112 --> 51:55.739
Hargreaves!

52:09.920 --> 52:13.381
All right, everybody gather around.
Better do a body count.

52:13.548 --> 52:15.050
One, two...

52:15.217 --> 52:17.844
...three, four, fag...

52:18.303 --> 52:20.597
- ...six.
- And Bello's in the bath.

52:21.139 --> 52:22.724
Seven.

52:23.141 --> 52:25.936
There's no power anywhere.
Blackout for miles.

52:26.102 --> 52:28.063
Everybody sits tight
until I've gathered intel.

52:28.230 --> 52:30.774
Matron, take some candles up
to the headmaster.

52:30.941 --> 52:33.985
Lock up behind you.
Nobody leaves Sparta.

52:35.237 --> 52:37.322
Um, Clegg.

52:37.489 --> 52:39.157
Where's Meredith?

52:39.324 --> 52:42.369
Mr Houseman is not feeling well.

52:42.536 --> 52:43.829
He's taken to bed.

52:43.995 --> 52:45.330
I'm in charge now.

52:51.586 --> 52:52.796
What was that?

52:59.553 --> 53:02.806
No, the shafts have completely failed.

53:02.973 --> 53:07.018
It's only an earthquake.
It's an occupational hazard.

53:07.561 --> 53:09.437
Boss, look at this.

53:10.564 --> 53:14.192
Those things,
whatever they are, they're out.

53:14.359 --> 53:16.111
"Out"?

53:17.487 --> 53:20.866
The shafts are blown.
There is no way.

53:22.284 --> 53:23.827
- The sinkhole.
- The sinkhole.

53:37.924 --> 53:42.888
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan
a pleasure dome erect. Ha-ha.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.806
Boss, we've gotta go.

53:44.973 --> 53:47.392
We need to evacuate. It's doomsday.

53:47.559 --> 53:49.352
You don't wanna stay for dinner?

53:49.519 --> 53:53.273
Turns out these little babies,
they love fracking.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.234
It's made them fucking bonkers.

53:56.401 --> 53:58.737
You're off your fucking tits.

53:59.738 --> 54:01.114
- I'm out.
- Where you going?

54:01.281 --> 54:04.034
- They don't wanna bite you.
- Evacuate!

54:04.200 --> 54:07.746
- Come on! Let's go!
- You're not gonna bite him, are you?

54:10.123 --> 54:12.042
What the hell is going on?

54:15.045 --> 54:18.048
Fuck me. Who's got a weapon?

54:19.507 --> 54:22.093
- Give me that fucking Taser.
- You know how to use that?

54:22.260 --> 54:23.678
Hey, watch out... Aah!

54:24.179 --> 54:26.514
Oh, sorry. No, sorry.

54:26.681 --> 54:28.141
Sorry.

54:29.809 --> 54:31.645
Should we tell the headmaster?

54:31.811 --> 54:34.773
Sod the headmaster.
Where's the bloody choppers?

54:35.231 --> 54:36.524
We need choppers.

54:36.691 --> 54:38.443
Got that? I repeat...

54:43.448 --> 54:45.533
Chopper!

54:48.954 --> 54:50.163
Chopper!

54:50.956 --> 54:54.125
The Portaloo! The fucking bogs!

54:56.836 --> 54:58.797
Evacuate!

54:59.881 --> 55:03.885
- Fuck me, these mushrooms are strong.
- Everyone, we gotta leave!

55:10.100 --> 55:11.393
It's the sound again.

55:11.559 --> 55:12.936
They're back.

55:13.103 --> 55:14.938
Teddy, stay put.
I'm gonna come and get you.

55:19.776 --> 55:20.944
No.

55:21.111 --> 55:23.154
No. It's a dragon!

55:28.785 --> 55:31.496
Sounds like there's a war
going on out there.

55:31.663 --> 55:34.165
Maybe the frack hole's blown up.

55:36.876 --> 55:39.421
Sorry for putting you through all that.

55:40.005 --> 55:42.007
I'm such a tit.

55:42.590 --> 55:44.509
Don't be daft.

55:44.676 --> 55:47.178
You just can't handle your drink.

56:03.319 --> 56:05.071
Sod this.

56:06.031 --> 56:07.365
Where are you going?

56:07.532 --> 56:09.492
Think I'll take a look.

56:09.659 --> 56:11.327
Don't tell Cleggy.

56:11.494 --> 56:12.620
Fuck Clegg.

56:12.787 --> 56:15.040
Come on, duck. Let's have some fun.

56:50.575 --> 56:52.410
- Think I figured it out.
- Figured what out?

56:52.869 --> 56:55.663
The guy in the forest with the beard.
Prophet of doom.

56:55.830 --> 56:57.999
- He's an old Slaughterian.
- How do you know?

56:58.166 --> 57:00.543
<i>I did a bit of digging.
His name's Woodrow Chapman.</i>

57:00.710 --> 57:02.212
<i>Wait. Woody Chapman?</i>

57:02.921 --> 57:05.965
- Why? Do you know him?
- He's the school legend.

57:06.132 --> 57:08.343
<i>He's the big brother of Teddy Chapman.</i>

57:09.511 --> 57:10.887
The plaque in the basement.

57:11.805 --> 57:14.599
<i>- Chapman.
- That's Teddy.</i>

57:14.766 --> 57:18.812
He and Woody were trying to escape,
but he disappeared down in the tunnels.

57:18.978 --> 57:20.855
They've been sealed ever since.

57:21.022 --> 57:22.524
What happened?

57:22.690 --> 57:24.150
Well, that, my friend...

57:25.026 --> 57:28.905
...is the most terrifying story
of them all.

57:29.072 --> 57:32.283
- Aah! What is that?
- What?!

57:32.450 --> 57:34.744
- Two little schoolboys.
- Clemsie. Kay.

57:35.912 --> 57:37.539
- Queen of cunts.
- What are you doing?

57:37.705 --> 57:40.750
- We're going to investigate.
- And you're the backup.

57:41.793 --> 57:44.921
- All right.
- I can't drink any more of that.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.801
Pretend it's the end of the world.
We're all that's left of humanity.

57:49.968 --> 57:52.137
There's no need to pretend, darling.

57:52.303 --> 57:55.765
- We'll soon be eating each other.
- We're all going to die...

58:10.155 --> 58:12.657
Told you there was a war going on.

58:13.616 --> 58:15.535
What is this place?

58:15.702 --> 58:17.245
The anti-frack camp.

58:17.745 --> 58:20.748
- They have a Chinook?
- They've got power over there.

58:45.523 --> 58:47.859
Right, mate.
We need to call the police.

58:48.026 --> 58:49.277
The police?

58:52.405 --> 58:54.824
- What was that?
- Hello?

58:55.742 --> 58:57.744
It was a fox.

58:58.203 --> 58:59.913
- A fox?
- Over here.

59:03.583 --> 59:05.543
- Well, it's a...
- What the hell is it?

59:05.710 --> 59:07.670
- It's a...
- It's fucking ugly.

59:07.837 --> 59:10.340
It's got a snaggletooth.

59:10.506 --> 59:12.342
That thing needs to see
a fucking dentist.

59:12.508 --> 59:14.677
Guys, don't be mean.

59:15.136 --> 59:16.679
It looks kind of cute.

59:17.180 --> 59:18.348
Cute?

59:18.514 --> 59:19.933
Yeah.

59:20.099 --> 59:23.645
Yee. Hey, little baby.

59:24.103 --> 59:25.980
Where's your mummy?

59:29.943 --> 59:31.194
Clemsie!

59:31.611 --> 59:32.695
Get it off me!

59:32.862 --> 59:34.656
Clemsie, no! No, Clemsie, watch out.

59:34.822 --> 59:37.533
There's a sinkhole.
Clemsie! I've got you.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.327
Get the fuck off me!

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:04.227
The ecstasy of death.

01:00:05.395 --> 01:00:07.146
You okay?

01:00:09.524 --> 01:00:12.568
- You are... You're all right, Clemsie.
- Yeah.

01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:14.821
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:19.158
- You killed it.
- Give Boadicea a fag.

01:00:30.253 --> 01:00:32.005
It's old foxy again.

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:35.925
Will you stop saying it's a fucking fox?
It's clearly not a fox, is it, Willoughby?

01:00:43.516 --> 01:00:47.020
All right, Wootton. Death beckons.

01:00:47.562 --> 01:00:49.022
Your move.

01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:52.025
So let me see.

01:00:52.191 --> 01:00:55.528
I'd like to summon a demon,
please, Hargreaves.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:59.574
You would, would you? Just like that.
Bring the darkness.

01:00:59.741 --> 01:01:02.910
- But I'm a necromancer.
- You're a dick. Roll 20.

01:01:03.077 --> 01:01:04.620
If you miss, you die.

01:01:04.787 --> 01:01:08.374
- That's tyranny!
- That's the rules, bitch.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.209
Twenty.

01:01:10.376 --> 01:01:14.088
You know, Hargreaves, one day I'll be
a god, and then I'm gonna fucking...

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:17.008
I can't quite see you
at the Arcadian orgy somehow.

01:01:17.175 --> 01:01:21.095
- And you're perfect sex-god material?
- Fuck off.

01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:24.349
What is an orgy, anyway?

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:28.186
For fuck's sake, would you just roll,
please? Twenty or death.

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:35.193
What's that sound?

01:01:35.651 --> 01:01:36.778
What's that smell?

01:01:38.488 --> 01:01:42.158
- Ugh. Hargreaves, Jesus!
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:45.203
That's evil.
Talk about summoning the dead.

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:47.246
Fuck's sake, come on.

01:01:48.873 --> 01:01:50.750
Good grief.

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:53.211
What's all this?
And why are you exposing yourself?

01:01:53.378 --> 01:01:55.088
Oh, sorry, sir.

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.632
There's something you need to see.

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:02.220
What is it? Someone's head? Ha-ha.

01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:03.930
Not just a head, sir.

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:05.723
It's a whole body.

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.141
Mm.

01:02:07.308 --> 01:02:09.394
Well, goodness.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.853
I am intrigued.

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:16.859
Dear God.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:21.489
- This looks like Tuesday's pudding.
- Bit of custard on it, be nice.

01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:25.535
- Uh, sir, it attacked Clemsie.
- I'm afraid I had to kill it, sir.

01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:29.080
Sir, if you look closely,
you can still make out the jaw.

01:02:29.247 --> 01:02:31.791
See? They're carnassial teeth,
clearly visible.

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:33.459
It's a carnivore.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:38.756
I think quite possibly a rare or even
undiscovered subterranean subspecies.

01:02:39.632 --> 01:02:41.175
- Aah!
- God.

01:02:42.218 --> 01:02:45.471
Well, fascinating. Thank you, Matron.

01:02:45.638 --> 01:02:47.056
Thank God for rat poison.

01:02:47.223 --> 01:02:50.726
- I'll tell the ground staff on Sunday.
- Sir, this is way beyond rats.

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:53.271
You need to call the police now.

01:02:53.646 --> 01:02:54.897
The police?

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:59.152
Clemsie, this is a school matter.
We're not bothering the rozzers.

01:02:59.318 --> 01:03:02.947
- Sir, we've been to the frack site.
- No, no, no.

01:03:03.114 --> 01:03:06.909
No, Mr Spray and the ground staff
will see to the vermin on Monday.

01:03:07.118 --> 01:03:08.453
Ahem. Now...

01:03:08.619 --> 01:03:11.998
...in the meantime, I'm going
to have to notify your parents.

01:03:12.165 --> 01:03:13.291
What?

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:15.042
I can't have pupils
wandering about...

01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:17.128
...in the middle of the night
after orders...

01:03:17.295 --> 01:03:19.589
- Are you serious?
- In the forest.

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:21.883
An area you all knew
was strictly out of bounds.

01:03:22.049 --> 01:03:25.136
No! This is what you're going to do.

01:03:25.303 --> 01:03:27.054
You're going to put us in the car...

01:03:27.221 --> 01:03:29.974
...and you're going to drive us
to the nearest police station...

01:03:30.141 --> 01:03:33.227
...right fucking now...

01:03:34.395 --> 01:03:35.438
...sir.

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:41.319
- What exactly...?
- There's something in the woods.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:45.031
Uh, do you have your car keys, sir?

01:03:45.198 --> 01:03:50.453
Only I think we should probably be
getting off fairly soon-ish.

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:11.349
- Anybody seen Blake or Wallace?
- No, Clegg.

01:04:11.516 --> 01:04:13.518
Stand up straight
when you speak to a house god.

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:18.439
And you take off
those fucking ears now.

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.360
Nobody leaves.

01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:30.201
Keys, keys, keys.

01:04:30.368 --> 01:04:33.746
- Ah. Presto.
- Thank God, let's go.

01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:35.748
Wait. There won't be
enough room in the car.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:39.001
Who's gonna stay and hold the fort?
Lawrence, you're Upper Sixth.

01:04:39.168 --> 01:04:42.838
- If anyone's staying, it should be you.
- Don't be ridiculous, I'm driving.

01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:45.758
You're the one who's responsible.
You and your dodgy frack buddies.

01:04:45.967 --> 01:04:48.261
Now, just you jolly well hold on.

01:04:48.427 --> 01:04:50.972
She's right, though, isn't she?
Your boy in the wood told us.

01:04:51.138 --> 01:04:54.892
- You and Terrafrack.
- Oh, dear.

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:58.396
I fear you have been poisoned
by the ravings of a lunatic.

01:04:58.563 --> 01:05:00.898
- He's not mad. He's...
- My old roommate.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.485
Class of '88.

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.445
Old school tie.

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:09.031
Yeah? Wake up. Ha-ha-ha.

01:05:09.198 --> 01:05:11.033
What's Woody been telling you, eh?

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:15.413
There's a sinister evil lurking
beneath our school?

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:18.958
He's been playing the same old record
since he was 14.

01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:21.294
- Now, look, boys, boys.
- Ahem.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.629
I get it. And girls.

01:05:23.796 --> 01:05:27.633
The world's a bloody mess
and you want someone to blame.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:33.347
But the truth is, there is nothing
dodgy about Terrafrack.

01:05:33.514 --> 01:05:38.811
They are a heavily regulated
and highly reputable energy supplier.

01:05:38.978 --> 01:05:40.396
And without their help...

01:05:40.563 --> 01:05:45.276
...we simply do not have the funds
to maintain our school. Fact.

01:05:46.652 --> 01:05:47.987
Don't try and stop me, Chippy.

01:05:48.613 --> 01:05:52.450
And while we're talking about facts,
I am getting sick to death...

01:05:52.617 --> 01:05:56.037
...of this endless scaremongering
about hydraulic fracking.

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:58.080
There is no danger.

01:05:58.247 --> 01:06:00.791
There is no risk.
The only genuine risk...

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:04.462
...is of a bankrupt United Kingdom
with no affordable energy.

01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:08.215
Or worse,
energy entirely dependent on China!

01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:10.343
Well, by golly...

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:13.429
...you may not care
about this country of ours...

01:06:13.596 --> 01:06:15.765
...but I'm not giving up
without a fight.

01:06:15.931 --> 01:06:20.186
We are drilling for shale gas
if it's the last thing we...

01:06:20.645 --> 01:06:23.814
Podge! There's a big dog.

01:06:58.557 --> 01:07:00.601
To the Škoda!

01:07:02.978 --> 01:07:04.647
Open it.

01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:07.566
Damn, it's a rental, you see.
The Jag's got a flat.

01:07:07.733 --> 01:07:09.944
- Are you serious?
- Try again, open the door!

01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:13.155
You're pressing the wrong button.
Give that to me.

01:07:14.532 --> 01:07:17.410
- How did you do that?
- Fuck's sake, just get in and drive.

01:07:18.536 --> 01:07:20.371
- Seat belts, everyone.
- Hurry!

01:07:20.538 --> 01:07:22.164
I'm going as fast as I can!

01:07:22.832 --> 01:07:25.960
- I am not driving without my seat belt.
- Please, sir, just hurry up.

01:07:26.127 --> 01:07:28.879
- You're making me nervous!
- You're making me nervous, sir.

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:30.798
Brace yourselves, children.

01:07:35.886 --> 01:07:37.680
Mr Chips.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.641
Oh, no.

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:43.519
- Chips. Chippy. Dear God!
- Goodbye, Mr Chips.

01:07:43.686 --> 01:07:45.938
- What the hell is he doing?
- Give him a moment.

01:07:46.105 --> 01:07:48.566
- He reversed over his best friend.
- What was it?

01:07:48.733 --> 01:07:51.402
Some kind of rare, undiscovered
subterranean subspecies.

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.738
And you've pissed it off!

01:08:38.491 --> 01:08:40.658
- Stop!
- We're in a fucking hedge.

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:41.868
Let me drive.

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:56.926
<i>♪ Once on a high and windy hill ♪</i>

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:05.559
<i>♪ In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed ♪♪</i>

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.269
Don!

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:09.020
Stop!

01:09:09.188 --> 01:09:11.148
Don, fucking brake now!

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:20.115
Jesus Christ.

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:38.591
- Oh, Clemsie, that is a lot of glass.
- Is it dead?

01:09:38.759 --> 01:09:40.176
Dead?

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:43.221
It's been dissected.

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:47.225
Really, Clemsie? That's the second
living thing you've killed this evening.

01:09:47.393 --> 01:09:49.060
Guys...

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:51.145
...how many more are there?

01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:13.669
- What? Why are you stopping?
- Clemsie, come on, drive.

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:17.590
I have to go back.

01:10:19.508 --> 01:10:21.385
It's Smudger, I...

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.762
I can't leave him.

01:10:25.556 --> 01:10:27.433
He's my brother.

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:31.186
Smudger?

01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:32.855
He's your brother?

01:10:34.106 --> 01:10:35.608
Yeah.

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:40.321
Of course. Yeah,
we got to go back for your brother.

01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:42.781
Do we, though?

01:10:42.948 --> 01:10:45.492
- Thank you, Don.
- Clemsie, he's your brother.

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:47.536
We can't leave your brother behind,
can we?

01:10:47.703 --> 01:10:49.872
Come on, guys, we can do this.

01:10:50.039 --> 01:10:52.541
We are all going to die.

01:10:56.754 --> 01:10:58.213
Guys, what happened out there?

01:10:58.631 --> 01:11:00.841
- Clemsie ran into a creature.
- Where's Mr Houseman?

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:03.093
- No sign of him. Clegg's gone too.
- Clegg?

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.095
Maybe he's been eaten.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:08.307
- Don't get your hopes up.
- We need to hurry up.

01:11:08.474 --> 01:11:09.558
What time is it?

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:11.936
It's tool-up time.

01:11:13.771 --> 01:11:15.689
- What is all that crap?
- It's games cupboard.

01:11:15.856 --> 01:11:17.566
You can find anything in here.

01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:22.112
- Last worn by the Duke of Clarence.
- Last worn by Hargreaves.

01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.822
- Wait a sec.
- Gross.

01:11:24.406 --> 01:11:27.076
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Just needs some petrol.

01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:28.827
Get fucking real.

01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:41.340
Where is your brother?

01:11:43.676 --> 01:11:44.927
He's at a party.

01:11:54.979 --> 01:11:56.939
Cripes. He's gonna finger her.

01:11:57.314 --> 01:11:58.399
Oh, he is.

01:11:58.565 --> 01:12:01.485
- He is, he's a bloody animal.
- Let me have a go, please.

01:12:01.652 --> 01:12:03.529
- No.
- Give him a bloody go.

01:12:03.696 --> 01:12:05.531
- You're torturing him.
- I want a go.

01:12:05.698 --> 01:12:08.784
This is it.
This is Smudger's initiation.

01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:13.664
A "let's wear togas
and talk fucking Latin" orgy.

01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:16.166
- We have to stop it at once.
- Good luck with that.

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.419
They've been planning this all term.

01:12:18.585 --> 01:12:20.879
No wonder the country's fucked.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.090
Being run by these knobheads.

01:12:23.257 --> 01:12:24.842
Get him out! It's an emergency.

01:12:25.009 --> 01:12:27.011
I don't speak Latin.
Anyway, you're Upper Sixth.

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:31.140
- Aren't there rules about these things?
- Don, he's my brother. He's...

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:36.603
- He's...
- He's getting anointed by the head boy.

01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:39.857
- Wow. His hands are massive.
- Please, Don.

01:12:40.024 --> 01:12:43.110
- For me.
- All right. Come on, Will.

01:12:43.277 --> 01:12:45.738
Right-o. Yes.
I'll just keep watch from up here.

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:48.157
What do you mean, keep watch?
Come on, give me a hand.

01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.701
A hand? "Never touch the balls," right?

01:12:50.868 --> 01:12:52.953
Especially his.

01:12:54.246 --> 01:12:57.875
Make way for the head of school!

01:13:03.255 --> 01:13:05.966
- Poppet.
- Caesari.

01:13:08.886 --> 01:13:11.221
"Never touch the balls."

01:13:11.972 --> 01:13:13.682
What a load of bollocks.

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:19.021
What the devil's going on? What...?

01:13:19.188 --> 01:13:21.023
Matthew!

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:22.900
Where's everybody...?

01:13:23.067 --> 01:13:25.903
Hargreaves? Bello?

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:29.740
Sparta!

01:13:35.204 --> 01:13:36.246
Poppet.

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:38.874
Cor, I don't half fancy you.

01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:42.002
Mmm, I love it when you talk dirty.

01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:47.883
Smudger. Smudger, wake up.

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.676
It's time to go, mate.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:52.304
Come on, mate. It's breakfast time.

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.931
All right. Come on.

01:13:54.098 --> 01:13:55.349
Clemsie's here, mate.

01:13:55.516 --> 01:13:59.770
And the, uh... The headmaster's
been eaten by a wild animal.

01:13:59.937 --> 01:14:01.146
And you've shit yourself.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:02.356
Smudger!

01:14:02.523 --> 01:14:05.400
We got to go and if you think
I'm carrying you, you got another...

01:14:05.567 --> 01:14:07.402
- A new boy.
- No, no, I'm not part of this.

01:14:07.569 --> 01:14:10.030
- Restrain him.
- No, no. I'm just visiting. No, no, no!

01:14:10.197 --> 01:14:13.033
- Where did they come from?
- The Minotaur's back.

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:16.286
Hey, stop! We've got to get
out of here, you lunatics.

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:18.997
Start listening... Oh, fucking hell.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:21.044
- What are you doing?
- He's going <i>Fifty Shades.</i>

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:22.668
What? Give it back now.

01:14:24.128 --> 01:14:27.297
- Oh, this is not going to plan.
- We gotta go help him.

01:14:27.464 --> 01:14:30.384
- He's having fun.
- Willoughby, get down here quick!

01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:33.303
You don't get this type of thing
in Doncaster, you know.

01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.889
Fuck! We gotta go save them both.
Right. You take that.

01:14:36.056 --> 01:14:38.517
- Help!
- You two with me. Come on.

01:14:50.654 --> 01:14:53.115
- I've come to get you, Wallace. Shh.
- Christ.

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:57.953
When this lot wake up, they're gonna
find you skinned like a rabbit.

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:03.417
Do you know what that
means? No, of course you fucking don't.

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:08.755
It's Latin for "I'm gonna fuck
your face."

01:15:09.882 --> 01:15:11.049
Bloody hell.

01:15:11.216 --> 01:15:13.093
- It's Clegg.
- Clegg?

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.220
- Who's he gonna shag?
- Uh...

01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:17.890
Wallace, by the looks of it.

01:15:18.056 --> 01:15:19.641
Let me have another go, please.

01:15:19.808 --> 01:15:21.351
What the hell is going on here?!

01:15:21.518 --> 01:15:24.938
There's no power.
Sparta's completely empty.

01:15:25.105 --> 01:15:27.191
Who put me to bed?

01:15:32.321 --> 01:15:34.281
You're so warm.

01:15:34.448 --> 01:15:36.825
And wet.

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:38.577
And wide?

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:44.708
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:49.838
What was that?

01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:54.593
- It's happening.
- Aah!

01:15:56.094 --> 01:15:58.555
- I'm a necromancer.
- He's got a big knife. There's an orgy.

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:01.433
Stop shouting.
I've got a splitting headache.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.518
- The head's dead.
- And so is his dog.

01:16:13.237 --> 01:16:14.404
Wallace...

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:22.120
- Don!
- Oh!

01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:25.207
- Oh, you came for me. Thank God.
- Right. Help me carry Smudger.

01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:27.709
- Yeah, your brother. Yeah, yeah.
- Mummy.

01:16:35.676 --> 01:16:37.010
What are you doing with this?

01:16:37.177 --> 01:16:39.577
This pike saved the First Earl
of Slaughter from the beast...

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:42.516
What the devil?

01:16:45.852 --> 01:16:47.646
We've been trying to tell you, sir.

01:16:53.277 --> 01:16:54.403
Sir, come on.

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:44.453
I rather think it's dead, don't you?

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:47.998
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, sir.

01:17:51.126 --> 01:17:52.544
We should find somewhere to hide.

01:17:52.711 --> 01:17:54.838
- Like now.
- Smokers' corner?

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:12.481
So pretty dark. Hmm?

01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:16.777
Do you think
we've hit the bottom yet?

01:18:19.154 --> 01:18:22.616
It's funny to think an hour ago,
I was about to top myself.

01:18:22.783 --> 01:18:25.369
And here we are fighting for our lives.

01:18:29.289 --> 01:18:30.749
He looks like he's given up.

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:35.170
Come on. We need to keep moving.
Get back to the house.

01:18:36.713 --> 01:18:38.173
Save the children.

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:41.635
- Try and save the children.
- Mr Houseman, sir?

01:18:42.511 --> 01:18:45.639
We... We need you, right?

01:18:46.098 --> 01:18:49.101
Please, help us.

01:18:50.268 --> 01:18:53.605
Yes. Help. Yes, help you.

01:18:53.772 --> 01:18:55.941
Right. Um... Ahem.

01:18:56.108 --> 01:18:57.484
Where did they come from?

01:18:57.651 --> 01:19:00.404
- The creatures, where are they from?
- Out of the ground. We think.

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:03.073
- There must be a nest somewhere.
- And how many are there?

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.950
Dunno, sir.

01:19:05.242 --> 01:19:08.161
"Dunno"? "Dunno"?

01:19:08.328 --> 01:19:12.165
"Don't know." For heaven's sake,
enunciate, Wootton.

01:19:12.332 --> 01:19:14.376
- Sit up. Don't slouch.
- Sorry, sir.

01:19:14.543 --> 01:19:15.752
- Keep it together.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:18.106
There were four at the river
plus one that ate the head.

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:19.589
- So there's five.
- At least five.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:24.136
Right, so we must assume
that there is a... A herd or a pack...

01:19:24.302 --> 01:19:28.098
...or a hive. I'm sorry, I don't know
what the correct collective noun is.

01:19:28.265 --> 01:19:29.307
Frack?

01:19:30.851 --> 01:19:32.144
- A frack sounds good.
- I agree.

01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:34.354
- Yeah, I like frack.
- Me too.

01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:36.481
Jolly good. A frack of...
But a frack of what?

01:19:36.648 --> 01:19:38.150
Who the frack cares?

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:40.318
They ate half the Upper Sixth.

01:19:40.485 --> 01:19:42.362
Alive.

01:19:42.529 --> 01:19:46.032
Smudger, I'm sorry. At least they died
doing something they enjoyed.

01:19:48.285 --> 01:19:50.036
- A distress flare.
- Someone's in distress.

01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:53.331
- We need to call the army.
- It probably is the army...

01:19:53.498 --> 01:19:55.041
...in distress.

01:19:56.126 --> 01:19:57.210
The cadet range.

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:59.087
Team...

01:19:59.921 --> 01:20:02.132
...we need firepower.

01:20:14.978 --> 01:20:16.313
Stand back.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.148
I'm gonna ram it.

01:20:18.315 --> 01:20:20.609
Wait, where's Smudger?

01:20:22.152 --> 01:20:23.778
Back door's open.

01:20:24.029 --> 01:20:25.739
Right. Come on.

01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:28.992
- Ugh... Damn shoulder.
- Sorry, sir.

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:31.286
Think I dislocated it.

01:20:33.205 --> 01:20:35.874
- Guns. Firepower.
- Now we can blow shit up.

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:37.709
- Language, Wootton.
- Sorry, sir.

01:20:37.876 --> 01:20:39.628
- Hargreaves, get the generator on.
- Right.

01:20:39.794 --> 01:20:41.755
- Girls, glow sticks.
- Sir.

01:20:41.922 --> 01:20:43.381
- Willoughby, water.
- Sir.

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:44.966
- Smudger.
- Yeah?

01:20:45.133 --> 01:20:47.260
Find yourself some trousers
for God's sake.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:49.221
Right. Let's have a look at this.

01:20:50.347 --> 01:20:52.974
- Don. Throw me the bat.
- Sir?

01:20:57.062 --> 01:20:58.980
- Sorry, sir.
- Shoulder.

01:20:59.147 --> 01:21:00.857
- Are you all right?
- It's the old wound.

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:03.276
Killed my cricketing career,
you know?

01:21:03.443 --> 01:21:05.612
Could have bowled for England
once upon a time.

01:21:07.155 --> 01:21:08.823
You're a good man, sir.
You know that.

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:13.245
Yes, well, maybe thank me
when we're all out of here, yes?

01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:15.914
Now, be a good boy
and smash that lock off.

01:21:18.166 --> 01:21:20.544
Oh. Aha!

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:23.630
- Whoo!
- Let there be light.

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:27.884
Good heavens.

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:30.929
Looking for these, are we?

01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:33.431
Matty.

01:21:33.598 --> 01:21:34.766
You're alive.

01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:38.937
- Thank God. Are you all right?
- I'm fine, sir. It's just a scratch.

01:21:39.104 --> 01:21:41.523
Right, well, very happy to hear that.
Very happy indeed.

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:43.858
Now, we have to get
this gun rack open at once.

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:46.861
You're not thinking of giving firearms
to these two, are you, sir?

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.990
Well, yes.
We've got to get all hands on deck.

01:21:53.827 --> 01:21:55.620
- What the...?
- These two degenerates...

01:21:55.787 --> 01:21:57.372
...need to answer for their crime.

01:21:57.539 --> 01:22:00.709
- What are you talking about crimes?
- The school ties, sir.

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:03.003
In the downstairs lavatories.

01:22:03.587 --> 01:22:05.505
And over my door.

01:22:05.672 --> 01:22:09.259
- Willoughby?
- Was it your idea of a little joke?

01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:11.344
You and Seymour?

01:22:12.804 --> 01:22:15.599
A pleb and a queer.

01:22:16.182 --> 01:22:19.060
Tell me, Blake, am I going
to find you buggering him too?

01:22:19.227 --> 01:22:20.478
Matty, stop it.

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:22.897
We can talk about that later.
Now is not the time.

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:26.192
- You've lost a lot of blood.
- There's always one or two, sir.

01:22:26.359 --> 01:22:30.280
- Trying to destroy our school.
- And what would be the point?

01:22:30.447 --> 01:22:34.284
- There will always be pricks like you.
- Matty, put that gun down!

01:22:34.451 --> 01:22:35.493
Matthew!

01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:38.705
Lower your weapon! That's an order!

01:22:39.331 --> 01:22:41.666
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ, Clegg!

01:22:41.833 --> 01:22:43.501
I'm establishing a new order.

01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:47.464
It's madness!

01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:50.842
- This is doomsday.
- Matthew, disgraceful behaviour.

01:22:52.093 --> 01:22:54.012
Wallace, Blake. On your feet now.

01:22:54.179 --> 01:22:55.180
For fuck's sake.

01:22:55.347 --> 01:22:58.433
We'll shove these two perverts
out the front door.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.895
And while they're being eaten alive,
we can make a run for the tunnels.

01:23:02.062 --> 01:23:04.105
- You're not serious.
- Yes.

01:23:04.272 --> 01:23:06.024
- Clegg, you're a sick bastard.
- Hey!

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:09.361
I'm giving you a chance
to be school martyrs.

01:23:10.612 --> 01:23:12.405
They may even put your name up
on a plaque.

01:23:13.073 --> 01:23:15.617
The first Wallace to die
like a gentleman.

01:23:15.784 --> 01:23:18.119
Think how proud your daddy would be.

01:23:18.286 --> 01:23:19.788
- No, you didn't.
- Hey.

01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:22.957
Matthew, will you stop doing that?!

01:23:23.124 --> 01:23:24.959
Outside. Both of you. Now.

01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:27.921
Everyone else, stand by.

01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:38.264
A signal.

01:23:41.685 --> 01:23:43.144
- Audrey.
<i>- Meredith.</i>

01:23:44.354 --> 01:23:46.189
Audrey, my darling. I'm here.

01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:49.025
We're all... The children.

01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:51.194
Yes, they're safe. Look.

01:23:51.695 --> 01:23:54.531
- They're with me.
<i>- We need to speak.</i>

01:23:55.699 --> 01:23:57.659
Something terrible has happened
at the school.

01:23:57.826 --> 01:24:00.495
<i>- Meredith, you're breaking up.</i>
- Audrey, can you hear me?

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:03.081
Audrey, you must call for help, please.

01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:05.917
- Text her before we lose the signal.
- Yes.

01:24:07.585 --> 01:24:10.338
- SOS Slaughterhouse.
<i>- I can't hear you.</i>

01:24:10.922 --> 01:24:13.508
- Sausages?
- Bloody auto-text.

01:24:15.552 --> 01:24:18.763
- Help me!
- Enough, Clegg. Let him go.

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:21.224
Put your hands in the air.

01:24:21.725 --> 01:24:24.853
I'm not taking orders
from a fourth year, Hargreaves.

01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:26.688
I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:24:26.855 --> 01:24:29.190
You don't understand. This is war!

01:24:29.858 --> 01:24:32.652
No, this is Sparta.

01:24:37.991 --> 01:24:39.367
Hargreaves...

01:24:39.534 --> 01:24:42.162
...you shot me in the neck. Wow.

01:24:43.705 --> 01:24:46.332
Fuck. Oh, God.

01:24:47.417 --> 01:24:49.335
Fuck. Fuck.

01:24:49.502 --> 01:24:52.088
You're a fucking disgrace to the house!

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:57.177
You pathetic fucking plebs.

01:25:07.312 --> 01:25:08.897
Hold on, Matty!

01:25:10.815 --> 01:25:12.442
Get off him!

01:25:14.903 --> 01:25:16.446
Get off!

01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.822
Matty!

01:25:24.496 --> 01:25:26.998
<i>Meredith. Meredith.</i>

01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.666
<i>Meredith.</i>

01:25:30.794 --> 01:25:34.714
Children, save yourselves!
Get to the tunnels.

01:25:38.176 --> 01:25:39.344
Jesus.

01:25:39.761 --> 01:25:41.679
You heard him. Now's our chance.

01:25:43.014 --> 01:25:44.265
- Run.
- The tunnels.

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:50.146
<i>Meredith? No, Meredith?</i>

01:25:50.313 --> 01:25:53.900
<i>You're breaking up.
Look, I'm not coming home, Meredith.</i>

01:25:54.067 --> 01:25:55.401
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:25:55.568 --> 01:25:58.905
<i>It's over for us. It's over.</i>

01:26:00.865 --> 01:26:02.492
Come on.

01:26:05.954 --> 01:26:08.790
I can't run in these bloody wellies.

01:26:14.045 --> 01:26:15.964
- Run!
- Run, come on.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.383
Run. Come on!

01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:21.469
Come on, Smudge. Get up! Get up.

01:26:23.847 --> 01:26:25.473
Come on.

01:26:38.695 --> 01:26:41.573
- Someone's had the same idea.
- The not-so-very-secret tunnels.

01:26:41.739 --> 01:26:44.450
Well, who's going first?

01:26:45.076 --> 01:26:46.786
Ladies?

01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:51.624
Excuse me. Coming through.

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:54.586
Come on, go, go, go.

01:27:00.133 --> 01:27:02.176
Oh, Christ.

01:27:05.555 --> 01:27:07.724
Tunnels, my ass. This is a sewer.

01:27:13.021 --> 01:27:14.689
Hey, I know this.

01:27:14.856 --> 01:27:17.984
- The story of the school.
- Hey, what's that say?

01:27:18.151 --> 01:27:21.779
Look. It's the First Earl
driving the beast back into its cave.

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:24.198
The First Earl constructed
the original house...

01:27:24.365 --> 01:27:26.492
...on top of the beast's lair.

01:27:26.659 --> 01:27:29.454
This whole labyrinth was carved out
by the beast itself.

01:27:29.621 --> 01:27:33.791
So we're hiding in its fucking lair?
Thanks, Mr Houseman.

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:36.002
Coming down here was
a really crap idea!

01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:39.756
- Wootton finally passed the house test.
- Nice one. Shame we're all gonna die.

01:27:39.923 --> 01:27:40.965
Tough.

01:27:41.132 --> 01:27:43.176
- Shut up, Willoughby.
- Maybe we should go back.

01:27:43.343 --> 01:27:45.053
To where that creature's waiting?

01:27:46.387 --> 01:27:47.764
What was that?

01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:52.393
- Something touched my leg.
- That was me. Sorry.

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.687
Your hands are fucking freezing.

01:27:54.854 --> 01:27:57.398
- Shall we split up?
- Split up? Are you insane?

01:27:57.565 --> 01:27:59.984
Mathematically speaking,
our chances of finding the way...

01:28:00.151 --> 01:28:03.488
Mathematically speaking,
we're the square root of fucked!

01:28:05.239 --> 01:28:08.409
- It followed us. It's got into the tunnel!
- Aah!

01:28:19.545 --> 01:28:20.588
Oh, no.

01:28:20.755 --> 01:28:22.924
There's gotta be another way out.

01:28:24.008 --> 01:28:25.635
We're gonna die down here.

01:28:25.802 --> 01:28:28.262
- Like Teddy Chapman.
- I'm gonna die unfulfilled.

01:28:28.429 --> 01:28:32.392
- I'm gonna die a virgin.
- I'm gonna die in Greek sandals.

01:28:35.687 --> 01:28:37.897
Where the fuck do we go now?

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.073
You two still looking for some drugs?

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.367
Woody Chapman? Thank God.

01:28:49.534 --> 01:28:51.703
- He's Woody Chapman?
- Never heard of him.

01:28:51.869 --> 01:28:54.455
Anyone seen my little brother?

01:28:55.123 --> 01:28:59.585
Huh? Teddy! I've come back for you!

01:29:00.753 --> 01:29:02.255
- Woody?
- I've gotta find little Ted.

01:29:02.422 --> 01:29:03.965
Woody, so sorry, mate.

01:29:04.132 --> 01:29:07.301
Teddy's gone, okay? But you need
to help us get out of here.

01:29:08.261 --> 01:29:10.555
There ain't any way out of hell.

01:29:10.722 --> 01:29:12.557
Don't be daft. You got out before.
Remember?

01:29:12.724 --> 01:29:14.892
Yeah, you came down with Teddy.
You tried to escape.

01:29:15.059 --> 01:29:18.271
Escape? We weren't trying to escape.

01:29:18.438 --> 01:29:20.648
We were trying to blow up the school.

01:29:21.315 --> 01:29:23.443
We all knew about the gas down here.

01:29:23.609 --> 01:29:26.112
- Blow it up?
- Like Guy Fawkes?

01:29:26.279 --> 01:29:27.530
Like kaboom!

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:31.617
It was my idea.

01:29:32.243 --> 01:29:33.745
We got separated.

01:29:34.704 --> 01:29:36.539
I lost Teddy.

01:29:36.998 --> 01:29:38.291
Something happened.

01:29:38.458 --> 01:29:41.210
It was them, weren't it?
Those creatures.

01:29:41.711 --> 01:29:43.629
- The beasts.
- You got out, right?

01:29:44.672 --> 01:29:46.299
How?

01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:48.885
- Found a path.
- A path?

01:29:49.052 --> 01:29:50.386
- What path?
- There's a path?

01:29:50.553 --> 01:29:53.806
The path to immortality.

01:29:53.973 --> 01:29:56.851
- Lucky.
- Yeah. And now?

01:30:02.523 --> 01:30:03.608
Unlucky.

01:30:16.537 --> 01:30:17.538
What do we do now?

01:30:18.164 --> 01:30:20.666
We need a distraction,
like a feint move in chess.

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:22.543
- Yes, yes, exactly.
- Will?

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:25.379
- You distract it, mate.
- What?

01:30:27.173 --> 01:30:29.467
That light. These creatures...

01:30:29.634 --> 01:30:32.053
- ...they're subt... Subterran...
- They live underground.

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:33.429
- They live underground.
- Yes.

01:30:33.596 --> 01:30:37.642
And it's dark underground.
So these creatures must hate light.

01:30:37.809 --> 01:30:39.185
- Give me your torch.
- It's mine.

01:30:39.352 --> 01:30:41.270
Hand it over. I'm a prefect.

01:30:41.437 --> 01:30:43.940
- And I'm a house god.
- Fair play.

01:30:44.107 --> 01:30:46.275
Sparta '88.

01:30:46.901 --> 01:30:48.611
Have some of this, you little bitch.

01:30:49.237 --> 01:30:53.783
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the Flame of Anor.

01:30:53.950 --> 01:30:57.245
Go back to the shadows.
Go back to the...

01:30:57.411 --> 01:30:59.205
There's nothing to be frightened of.

01:30:59.831 --> 01:31:01.415
What's this?

01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:03.376
Huh?

01:31:04.252 --> 01:31:05.336
Look.

01:31:08.047 --> 01:31:09.841
Oh, there's my boy.

01:31:12.677 --> 01:31:13.970
That's a good boy.

01:31:14.345 --> 01:31:17.056
He's like a doggy. Hey.

01:31:17.223 --> 01:31:20.560
Actually, he's all right. He's quite nice.

01:31:20.726 --> 01:31:24.021
- You genius. It worked.
- And I got an E in Biology.

01:31:25.857 --> 01:31:27.608
Where's the cats? Where's the cats?

01:31:42.999 --> 01:31:45.418
That was close. Ha-ha.

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:50.173
I shouldn't have said "cats."
I shouldn't have said "cats."

01:31:51.716 --> 01:31:54.385
Teddy. Huh.

01:31:54.552 --> 01:31:56.220
What are you doing here?

01:31:56.762 --> 01:31:58.514
Teddy.

01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.474
Of course there's a way out.

01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:02.185
You just gotta follow the...

01:32:05.104 --> 01:32:07.106
You gotta follow the...

01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:46.646
A dead end!

01:32:46.812 --> 01:32:49.190
Path? Where...?
Where's this fucking path?

01:32:50.775 --> 01:32:52.068
There's an air current.

01:32:52.235 --> 01:32:54.111
It's defogging my...

01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:56.322
The path to immorality.

01:32:56.656 --> 01:32:59.242
- Go down there. Go!
- Immortality.

01:32:59.408 --> 01:33:02.787
- Doesn't matter.
- Go on, quick. Go, quick.

01:33:05.206 --> 01:33:07.583
- Come on.
- It's coming.

01:33:28.437 --> 01:33:31.148
- They're right above us.
- There.

01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:40.116
- It's the bloody frack.
- And that's our bloody way out.

01:33:40.741 --> 01:33:42.159
- Don, your tie.
- What?

01:33:42.326 --> 01:33:43.411
Give me your tie.

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:50.126
Finally hit the bottom, eh?

01:33:51.544 --> 01:33:53.754
Be a flame, Ducky.

01:33:55.506 --> 01:33:57.466
Welcome to hell, you son of a bitch!

01:33:58.175 --> 01:34:00.678
- Willoughby!
- Willoughby!

01:34:03.639 --> 01:34:06.017
Hey, let's get out now!

01:34:06.183 --> 01:34:07.685
Willoughby!

01:34:08.602 --> 01:34:10.438
Don! Come on!

01:34:15.443 --> 01:34:17.403
Don, come on.

01:34:22.575 --> 01:34:24.785
- Don't fucking die.
- Go!

01:34:38.341 --> 01:34:39.759
Dab of snuff?

01:34:50.353 --> 01:34:51.729
Go!

01:35:16.045 --> 01:35:18.464
Will. Will, give me your lighter.

01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:20.800
It isn't mine. It was his.

01:35:25.721 --> 01:35:27.264
Come on, Seymour.

01:35:27.431 --> 01:35:29.600
If you're out there, be a flame!

01:35:30.393 --> 01:35:31.852
All right, Seymour.

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:33.896
Bequeath this, motherfuckers.

01:35:41.445 --> 01:35:43.656
Clemsie, it's gonna blow!

01:35:43.823 --> 01:35:45.825
Fucking run!

01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:24.613
Fucking hell.

01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:53.601
Congratulations, Ducky.

01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:56.312
Really left your mark.

01:37:03.611 --> 01:37:07.615
My mum is gonna fucking kill me.

01:37:07.781 --> 01:37:09.366
Let's go.

Audrey, darling,
I knew you'd come back.

01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:35.851
I...
