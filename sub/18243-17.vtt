I have the book now,

- Hey, I had it first.

- Found it in high school.
- Gina: This man knows
how to use the book?

00:19.671 --> 00:23.501
- He's a former protector.
- There were other protectors
after us?

We're all in danger.

- Who? Who knows
about the magic?
- I-- I'm sorry, what?

Why would someone
spell R.J.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.990

the magic?

02:17.311 --> 02:19.617
Mom found this abandoned
in Lavender Heights.

02:19.704 --> 02:22.316
It's a classic,
and the city was
just gonna junk it.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.361
So I offered to
take it off their hands.

Mom thinks that since
I'm working from home now,

you girls don't have
enough space.

02:27.669 --> 02:31.803
Yeah, you can
turn it into a clubhouse
and have some privacy.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.893
There's even a stove,
so you can cook.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.201
Thanks, Grandma,
that's a great idea.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.856
But I think we need to
clear out the bad juju
first.

that last occupant

02:43.772 --> 02:45.861

Yes, we do our best thinking

Lavender Heights
High School year books?

03:40.307 --> 03:43.788
R.J. went here
so his friends
probably did, too.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.964
And the cookbooks

three best friends,

03:46.051 --> 03:48.097
like the OCs and us.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.186
So there's gotta be
pictures of them together.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.101
It's not like we're
always together.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.060
Yeah, you're right.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.589
All right,
check this out.

04:01.676 --> 04:05.767
In 1995, R.J. White was
the AV Club trainee,

04:05.854 --> 04:07.725
and the football team's
equipment manager.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.379
He look dorky.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.425
Well, look what happened
in 1996.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.601
R.J. was quarterback
of the football team,

04:13.688 --> 04:17.257
and class president,
and homecoming king.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.997
He still looks dorky.

04:19.084 --> 04:22.043
Then, in 1997,
he's barely visible,

04:22.130 --> 04:24.742
except for being voted
most likely to get detention.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.268
1996 was his year
of awesome.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.270
That's when he must have
had the book.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.751
Now, we just have to
find pictures of R.J.
and his two BFFs.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.821
This is hopeless.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.345

he's either by himself,

05:02.432 --> 05:03.868
or in a class
full of students.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.217
It's hard to tell
who he's friends with,

05:05.305 --> 05:07.307
and who he's
just next to.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.439

In the '90s,
they had

05:09.526 --> 05:11.136

05:11.223 --> 05:12.877

05:16.272 --> 05:19.014
That's not the point.
Look at this.

05:19.101 --> 05:20.798
- Kelly: That's R.J.
- Hannah: Yeah.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.800
Kelly: He was interviewed
and he has a friend with him.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.976
That could be one of
the other protectors.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.416
Oh. We need to find
that interview.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.026
But how?

05:31.113 --> 05:32.854
All we have to do is
look through old episodes of

05:32.941 --> 05:35.422
"Good Morning
Lavender Heights"
until we find it.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.293
It's kind of
a long shot.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.774
Maybe, but I don't have
any other ideas.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.471

05:41.558 --> 05:42.472
Not really.

want to?

the '90s for history.

Are these the shows
on old hard drives?

06:12.459 --> 06:15.157
They're not hard drives,
they look like tapes.

06:15.244 --> 06:18.682

before computers.

a lot of them.

- Um, may we borrow these?
- Sure.

it's Miss Silvers.

would they erase

I know how.

That's the spell
you used on Chuck.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.438
It didn't work on him
because--

07:18.525 --> 07:20.265
Well, we know why.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.224
But on a normal person,

07:22.311 --> 07:24.966
it erases their
knowledge of magic.

and thanks for the VCR
and TV.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.100

the last few.

hot dogs aren't hot?

With me I have
veteran lunch lady,
Janet Williamson.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.752
So what's the deal
with the cold dogs?

09:38.839 --> 09:40.536
- Fast forward.
- Janet,

09:40.623 --> 09:42.320
there have been complaints
from the student body

09:42.407 --> 09:44.801
- that they've been--

09:44.888 --> 09:47.630
Today we introduce
the first of our
three part series,

"Chemistry in Chemistry:

Fall In Love."

- Everyone know that
in Chemistry class--

09:56.117 --> 09:57.771
What do you think of
the principal's proposal

09:57.858 --> 09:59.424
to ban pajama pants?

09:59.511 --> 10:01.731
Bogus, man. These pants rock.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.167
- Do you feel students--
- No, they do not.

10:03.254 --> 10:05.300
- My turn.
- Boy: Yeah.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.301
- It's an expression of
who I really am.
- Wait.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.346
Look, in the background.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.393
Well,
you heard it here first,
Lavender Heights--

10:11.480 --> 10:13.656
Darby: R.J.

10:13.743 --> 10:14.831
Good catch, Darby.

10:16.790 --> 10:17.878
R.J.'s with
a few friends,

10:17.965 --> 10:19.706
but I-- I can't see
their faces.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.838
Hannah: And I think that's
the same girl he was with

10:21.925 --> 10:24.188
in the yearbook photo.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.190
I'll keep going.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.149

10:31.500 --> 10:34.242
- [sighs]
- Let's try to find
the interview.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.548
It has to be in
one of these tapes.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.334
This could take
forever.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.902
Yeah, there's a lot of tapes
to go through.

22:31.741 --> 22:32.960
You should be.

22:36.920 --> 22:40.010
I guess I-- I do
still think of you
as the old Darby.

22:42.317 --> 22:44.058
I didn't mean to
embarrass you
in front of Piper.

22:45.842 --> 22:46.800
I know.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.500
She seems really nice,
by the way.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.546
Just tell her not to
call me Kells.

22:57.245 --> 23:00.335
Well, we still have
a lot of tapes to watch.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.206
We should get started.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.907
Girl: As prom season
approaches,

23:06.994 --> 23:09.213
the to do list for students
grows by the day.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.693
Rent the tux,
make dinner reservations--

23:10.780 --> 23:14.262
People were really into
the flannel in the '90s.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.524
And combat boots.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.352
[giggling]

23:19.093 --> 23:21.487
- And mom jeans.
- [giggling]

23:21.574 --> 23:23.184
Time to put in
the next tape.

23:23.271 --> 23:25.360
The high prices
haven't deterred people.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.753
[giggling]

23:34.021 --> 23:35.718
[knocking]

23:37.894 --> 23:38.939
[bell jingles]

23:39.026 --> 23:40.027
What are you doing?

23:40.114 --> 23:41.594
I told you
never to come here.

23:44.379 --> 23:46.294
[indistinct dialog]

23:48.514 --> 23:50.341
So far, juniors have
raised more money--

23:50.429 --> 23:53.214
Kelly, Hannah,
wake up.

23:53.301 --> 23:56.391
Look, it's the interview
we've been looking for.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.915
[tape rewinding]

23:59.002 --> 24:00.526
So far, juniors have
raised more money

24:00.613 --> 24:02.223
than the last two combined.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.746
Hannah:
Why does that girl
look so familiar?

24:03.833 --> 24:05.922
I don't know,
but she definitely does.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.142
Fourth and fifth period
every day this week.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.578
I've seen her somewhere,
I just can't place where.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.798
Stop by the
front of the school,

24:11.885 --> 24:14.583
and buy some baked goods
from R.J. White
and Noelle Jasper.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.716
Noelle Jasper?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.935
The same Noelle
who owns Saphron?

24:19.022 --> 24:20.676
Noelle:
Welcome to Saphron.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.200
My name is Noelle Jasper,

24:23.287 --> 24:24.680
and I wanted to
introduce myself.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.075
It's not exactly
a common name.

24:28.162 --> 24:29.685
Let's not jump to
conclusions.

24:29.772 --> 24:32.209
R.J. and Noelle
might have just
been friends.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.995
- This all looks
delicious, Noelle.
- Thanks.

24:35.082 --> 24:37.519
You have mango bars,
chocolate truffles,

24:37.606 --> 24:39.913
and my favorite,
brownie bites.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.482
Wait, mango bars as in
Magnetic Mango Bars?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.353
And Bitter Truth
Truffles?

24:45.440 --> 24:48.965
Not to mention Single-Serving
Cinnamon Brownie Bites.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.924
Those must have been
magical recipes.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.448
It's too much of
a coincidence.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.059
Guys, this means that
Noelle Jasper

24:56.146 --> 24:58.192
had to have been...

24:58.279 --> 25:00.411
A protector.
