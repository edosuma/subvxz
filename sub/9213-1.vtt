01:17.369 --> 01:18.882
So, Nick...

01:19.969 --> 01:21.687
...this is it?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.160
As promised.

01:26.329 --> 01:27.728
Les do it.

01:27.889 --> 01:30.278
I have a plane to catch.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.560
You know, Sonny...

01:53.729 --> 01:57.438
...you're wrong about him.
He's clean, man.

01:58.089 --> 02:00.045
We're about to find out.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.405
Put your guns down.

02:21.769 --> 02:23.407
Hello, Sascha.

02:24.489 --> 02:26.764
I'm Sonny Ekvall.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.204
You work for me.

02:32.529 --> 02:34.520
Nicholas, what is all this?

02:35.049 --> 02:36.528
Caught a little heat.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.328
One of our guys
is double-dealing with the Feds.

02:39.489 --> 02:41.525
Is no big deal.
Just procedure.

02:41.689 --> 02:43.884
- A polygraph.
- Nick was against this.

02:44.049 --> 02:45.562
I see.

02:45.729 --> 02:48.527
He says you are one of my family.

02:48.809 --> 02:51.881
But he always did bring home strays.

02:52.169 --> 02:54.603
That is why I am here.

02:56.009 --> 02:58.887
Are you friend or foe?

02:59.049 --> 03:00.528
I'm a friend.

03:03.569 --> 03:06.129
Sascha Petrosevitch.

03:06.289 --> 03:07.881
You are Russian.

03:08.049 --> 03:11.041
Yeah, I'm Russian.
You got a problem with that?

03:11.209 --> 03:13.928
I am an equal opportunities employer.

03:14.089 --> 03:17.445
As long as you are working the scene
making me money...

03:17.609 --> 03:18.598
...what do I care?

03:18.769 --> 03:24.162
Who did you work for before
you landed in my lap?

03:25.009 --> 03:26.488
Me.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.968
- Doing what?
- I ran a highland crew...

03:30.129 --> 03:32.882
...got popped,
did a nickel in Angola.

03:33.049 --> 03:35.563
Just trying to get into
something simple.

03:35.729 --> 03:40.519
I run the biggest crime syndicate
from Eastern Europe...

03:40.689 --> 03:42.839
...to the Pacific Rim.

03:44.169 --> 03:46.524
- That is simple?
- Cars are simple.

03:51.409 --> 03:54.082
You work for any
law enforcement agencies?

03:54.249 --> 03:57.241
Sometimes I work for the CIA,
the KGB...

03:57.409 --> 04:02.358
...the U.S. Marshals, when I got a little
bit of spare time...

04:02.529 --> 04:05.999
...I do a little something
for the Eastern Stasi.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.324
You left out the FBI.

04:17.488 --> 04:22.609
- Are you FBI?
- I boost cars. Thas all.

04:24.249 --> 04:27.958
I am a soldier trained in the art
of killing, not interrogation.

04:28.489 --> 04:31.003
Nick likes you.
He's a good boy.

04:31.169 --> 04:35.287
He's like a little brother to me.
So for him, I make an exception.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.883
But now, my patience is at the end.

04:38.889 --> 04:41.926
Are you FBI?

04:46.769 --> 04:48.168
No.

04:58.129 --> 05:01.678
Welcome to my family, Sascha.

05:02.729 --> 05:04.321
I told you.

05:04.569 --> 05:07.288
Make sure the boat leaves tonight.

05:34.449 --> 05:36.087
Is time, man.

05:36.609 --> 05:39.760
- Time for what?
- To take that ring off.

05:41.289 --> 05:43.245
She's a memory, Sasch.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.843
You felt the loss.

05:46.009 --> 05:47.647
Cried the tears.

05:47.809 --> 05:49.845
There's nothing more to do, man.

05:50.009 --> 05:52.204
I just can't let her go.

05:54.449 --> 05:56.599
I respect that.

05:56.769 --> 05:59.158
I feel that.

05:59.329 --> 06:01.047
Anyway...

06:01.969 --> 06:03.880
...I got a job.

06:04.049 --> 06:05.846
You want it?

06:06.569 --> 06:07.968
Yeah.

06:28.769 --> 06:32.603
Yo, Sasch, stop playing!
Stop driving so fast!

06:32.889 --> 06:34.561
Come on! Watch this!

06:48.849 --> 06:50.567
Watch the forklift!

06:53.089 --> 06:56.206
- Yeah, you like that.
- No, I don't like this.

07:07.929 --> 07:09.123
Oh, my God.

07:34.169 --> 07:36.285
I'm sorry about
what went down tonight.

07:36.449 --> 07:40.761
I told Sonny you was one of us,
but he runs the show his way.

07:40.929 --> 07:44.046
- Whas a Blue Book on these wheels?
- About 198 grand.

07:44.209 --> 07:48.122
- That makes my 5% worth what?
- 9600. Give or take.

07:48.289 --> 07:50.962
I'll take half now,
half when I deliver, right?

07:51.129 --> 07:53.484
You'll get it when we get there.

07:57.249 --> 07:59.717
Half now, Nicholas,
or we give this back.

08:01.169 --> 08:04.320
- How long we known each other?
- Two and a half years.

08:04.489 --> 08:06.366
So for about two...

08:07.489 --> 08:09.525
...two and a half years...

08:09.689 --> 08:12.681
...l've been asking you
to call me Nick.

08:13.089 --> 08:16.240
- I like Nicholas, all right?
- No, is not all right.

08:20.369 --> 08:24.601
Is all right. Put a little thug in it.
Maybe you'll get your money.

08:25.009 --> 08:26.681
I love Nicholas, all right?

08:26.849 --> 08:28.760
- Was that good?
- No, check it out.

08:28.929 --> 08:30.044
Read my lips.

08:30.449 --> 08:32.724
- All right.
- All right.

08:32.889 --> 08:34.799
- How was that?
- See how I'm doing that?

08:34.969 --> 08:37.563
All right. See what I'm getting at?

08:37.729 --> 08:39.241
I think...

08:39.409 --> 08:41.285
Thas tough for me.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.197
You whiter than I thought.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.321
- Stop playing.
- I'm a bad man, you know that.

09:06.729 --> 09:08.321
Stop the car!

09:20.329 --> 09:23.082
I'm gonna kick your ass one day.

09:23.249 --> 09:25.558
What are you guys doing?
Back to work!

09:25.729 --> 09:28.721
We're putting these cars
on the road in 37 minutes.

09:28.889 --> 09:31.642
- Where's my money?
- Hey, I'm good for it.

09:31.809 --> 09:34.369
- You know me.
- And you know me.

09:34.649 --> 09:39.086
Now, I want my 9600 or I'm gonna
take this big goddamn hammer...

09:39.249 --> 09:41.604
- Hey, come on.
...and have some fun.

09:41.769 --> 09:43.168
Hey, Sasch. Sasch.

09:44.609 --> 09:47.999
- You know you're crazy, right?
- Cuckoo crazy.

09:51.609 --> 09:54.487
- You expecting somebody?
- No.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.721
Get this car out of here.

10:10.289 --> 10:13.645
- Nicholas Frazier?
- Who wants to know?

10:15.049 --> 10:17.961
Special Agent Williams.
I'm with the FBI.

10:22.849 --> 10:24.999
Maybe you've heard of us?

10:26.169 --> 10:28.125
Yeah, I've heard of you.

10:29.169 --> 10:32.878
Thas no way to start.
Put your guns down. Les talk.

10:33.529 --> 10:35.997
I don't talk to pigs without my lawyer.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.637
I'm a lawyer.
You want my advice?

10:38.809 --> 10:42.882
Put the guns down. I'm looking
to bring down Sonny Ekvall.

10:43.049 --> 10:46.405
You wanna negotiate?
I'll cut you a sweet deal.

10:46.569 --> 10:48.719
Witness protection.
No time served.

10:49.329 --> 10:51.285
Ekvall's not for sale.

10:52.729 --> 10:54.845
You ever done hard time, Nick?

10:55.369 --> 10:57.803
Ever been somebody's bitch?

11:00.929 --> 11:04.285
You got big balls for a woman,
you know that?

11:04.449 --> 11:08.727
And you've got exactly five
seconds to put the guns down.

11:08.889 --> 11:13.007
Otherwise, people are gonna die.
You want that on your conscience?

11:13.169 --> 11:16.639
- Nobody's gotta die tonight.
- I'm not talking to you!

11:18.009 --> 11:19.158
Thas one, Nick.

11:21.529 --> 11:24.168
- You know, Sonny has a rule.
- Whas that?

11:24.329 --> 11:25.967
Thas two, Nick.

11:26.609 --> 11:27.758
Three!

11:28.089 --> 11:29.807
Nobody gets taken alive.

11:29.969 --> 11:32.164
- Four!
- Thas a bad rule, man.

11:32.329 --> 11:35.241
Five!
Put the goddamn guns down, now!

11:35.409 --> 11:38.765
- Put the gun down, man.
- Is a nice night to die.

13:16.569 --> 13:20.323
BP's dropping fast.
We gotta get this guy out of flat line!

13:20.489 --> 13:22.605
He's going into cardiac arrest!

13:22.769 --> 13:24.043
Clear!

13:27.369 --> 13:28.688
Clear!

13:30.289 --> 13:32.359
One, two, three!

13:34.409 --> 13:37.321
One, two, three, four, five!

13:38.409 --> 13:41.207
One, two, three, four, five!

14:00.249 --> 14:02.285
We got a pulse!

14:38.169 --> 14:43.118
I can't believe I ended up in this
situation. This is bullshit.

15:09.889 --> 15:11.402
My friend.

15:12.529 --> 15:14.804
Sasch?
How you been, man?

15:14.969 --> 15:19.565
- I've been better. How you feel?
- Is like I'm seeing a ghost.

15:19.729 --> 15:22.448
Give me some love, man!

15:22.609 --> 15:26.522
- Thought you was dead.
- For a while, but I'm back.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.642
I'm sorry about what happened
in the warehouse.

15:29.809 --> 15:31.720
I lost it. I went ballistic.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.642
Forget it.
Where'd you come from?

15:34.929 --> 15:38.205
They sent me down from
the SHU, Pelican Bay.

15:38.369 --> 15:40.929
- What about you?
- Infirmary, San Quentin.

15:41.089 --> 15:44.559
- Got another five years in this rat hole.
- I got two.

15:44.729 --> 15:48.358
Well, are we all right?
Or we got issues?

15:48.529 --> 15:51.282
- Whare you talking about?
- You might be pissed off.

15:51.489 --> 15:54.526
I don't wanna spend
the next five years...

15:54.689 --> 15:58.318
...wondering if my nigger
want to slit me from ear to ear.

15:58.489 --> 15:59.763
You're my man.

15:59.929 --> 16:03.808
When you get inside, you're gonna
have issues. They won't be with me.

16:03.969 --> 16:05.448
You all right?

16:07.409 --> 16:09.798
I'll see you on the inside.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.368
- What are you packing?
- Is my leg.

16:28.849 --> 16:31.363
I'm gonna ask again.
What are you packing?

16:31.529 --> 16:32.803
This.

16:36.649 --> 16:38.844
You wanna play rough?
I can play rough.

16:39.009 --> 16:41.569
Sorry, I'm not into men.

17:07.848 --> 17:09.919
You don't know who I am?

17:10.089 --> 17:11.840
Just doing my job, boss.

17:13.169 --> 17:16.525
- You gonna like this.
- Thas enough.

17:16.689 --> 17:19.521
You gonna learn to respect me.

17:21.848 --> 17:23.726
My kids hit harder than that.

17:24.249 --> 17:25.568
Chump.

17:41.009 --> 17:43.887
What you bringing
into my island, ese?

17:44.049 --> 17:46.404
My knee. Is titanium.

17:48.449 --> 17:50.883
- Which one?
- Left.

18:11.249 --> 18:13.240
You got a hard head, homeboy.

18:13.409 --> 18:17.846
Do yourself a favour.
Keep it on your shoulders.

18:20.649 --> 18:22.799
All right. Back to work.

18:23.369 --> 18:26.520
The attorney general
and Federal Bureau of Prlsons...

18:26.689 --> 18:30.364
...welcome you to the U.S. Federal
Penltentlary at Alcatraz.

18:30.529 --> 18:33.760
Mr. Hubbard, Robert Kennedy
closed Alcatraz in 1963...

18:35.409 --> 18:37.684
...claiming it was
cruel and inhumane...

18:37.849 --> 18:41.603
Actually, he closed it in June of '62.
Whas your question?

18:41.769 --> 18:45.808
Some say the new Alcatraz is a step
back in criminal warehousing...

18:45.969 --> 18:50.087
...especially now with the inauguration
of your new execution chamber.

18:50.249 --> 18:51.398
How do you respond?

18:51.569 --> 18:54.959
Our society has become
more violent and more corrupt.

18:55.129 --> 18:58.917
One out of every 30 men
in the United States is...

18:59.249 --> 19:02.924
- Whas the word I'm looking for?
- Criminally challenged.

19:03.649 --> 19:07.278
" Criminally challenged."
Thas the catch phrase now.

19:07.449 --> 19:12.603
- You're not answering the question.
- I think we have a generational gap.

19:12.769 --> 19:16.318
Perhaps my younger associate
can help clear things up.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.083
Give them a good sound bite, Donny.

19:21.529 --> 19:24.248
Alcatraz is a bad place
for bad people.

19:24.409 --> 19:27.799
If there's any discomfort here,
thas how it should be.

19:40.489 --> 19:43.162
Fresh meat, dog!

20:08.009 --> 20:11.763
Welcome to la Isla de los Alcatraces.

20:11.929 --> 20:14.397
The Island of Pelicans.

20:14.569 --> 20:19.882
You've been transferred here as part
of a work program to retrofit my island.

20:20.049 --> 20:24.247
But your free time will be spent
in a six-by-nine-foot cell.

20:24.409 --> 20:25.683
I urge you:

20:25.849 --> 20:29.888
Unplug. Kick your feet up.

20:31.889 --> 20:35.120
You will leave a big chunk
of your lives here.

20:35.449 --> 20:38.282
MI nombre es Juan Ruiz Escarzaga.

20:38.449 --> 20:43.569
My first summertime job was walking
a super-maximum tier 30 years ago.

20:43.729 --> 20:46.118
I walked it for over 15 years.

20:46.289 --> 20:50.805
Been spit on, stabbed, burned.

20:52.329 --> 20:54.684
And I'm still standing.

20:54.969 --> 20:56.687
You think you're hard.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.725
I'm harder.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.077
You think you're mean.

21:05.409 --> 21:07.320
I'm meaner.

21:07.489 --> 21:09.798
Alcatraz es ml casa.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.439
You are my guest.
I expect you to act like one.

21:13.609 --> 21:15.406
Son of a bitch!

21:15.569 --> 21:19.448
- What hole are you on, Little Joe?
- Seventeen.

21:20.569 --> 21:21.922
How you hitting it?

21:25.169 --> 21:28.639
Like a mother. Just can't putt.

21:29.449 --> 21:34.125
Little Joe here has a constructive
way of passing his free time.

21:34.289 --> 21:38.362
I suggest you find something
of the same. Be creative.

21:38.529 --> 21:43.398
Remember, this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.958
Ain't that right, Twitch?

21:46.129 --> 21:50.884
Same old, same old, man.

21:51.489 --> 21:53.286
Get a new rap, comprende?

21:56.489 --> 21:58.639
I like my rap.

21:58.809 --> 22:00.925
And here's the end of it.

22:02.769 --> 22:05.158
You got two llbros in your bundle.

22:05.729 --> 22:10.007
The rules and regs,
and the Klng James Blble.

22:10.169 --> 22:13.127
I highly recommend
you read them both.

22:13.649 --> 22:19.440
Now for those stupid enough
to think about escaping, go ahead.

22:19.609 --> 22:22.646
Climb the razor wire.
Do the breaststroke.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.367
Freeze your ass off.

22:25.129 --> 22:29.008
If the bay doesn't kill you,
we'll pick you up in a Zodiac...

22:29.169 --> 22:31.444
...and add five years
to your sentence.

22:33.329 --> 22:37.242
There's only one way
off this rock, homeys.

22:37.409 --> 22:40.321
And that key is under my pillow.

22:41.369 --> 22:47.046
I'm a fair man. You come to me
with a problem, I'll listen.

22:49.169 --> 22:51.524
Dead man walking.

23:01.529 --> 23:04.407
This man is about to make history.

23:04.569 --> 23:09.404
He will be the first to die
in Alcatraz's execution chamber.

23:09.569 --> 23:13.448
It is unfortunately my duty
to carry this out...

23:13.609 --> 23:16.248
...at midnight tonight.

23:18.609 --> 23:22.921
U.S. Supreme Court Justlce
Jane McPherson has just landed...

23:23.089 --> 23:27.082
...at New Alcatraz to wltness
the executlon of Lester McKenna.

23:27.249 --> 23:29.809
She Is the judge
who sentenced McKenna...

23:29.969 --> 23:34.485
...In the now Infamous helst of almost
$ 200 mllllon of U.S. gold brlck.

23:34.649 --> 23:39.723
Here's the twlst. McKenna stashed
the gold before he was apprehended.

23:39.889 --> 23:42.722
He v owed never to dlvulge
lts whereabouts...

23:42.889 --> 23:47.565
...whlch led to the treasure hunt by
the FBI thas gone on for 17 years.

23:47.729 --> 23:52.325
Now Is looklng llk e McKenna just
mlght tak e hls secret to the grave.

23:52.489 --> 23:55.481
Reportlng llve from Pler 39
on Flsherman's Wharf...

23:55.649 --> 23:58.447
...I'm Kelly Lange
from San Franclsco.

24:08.289 --> 24:09.688
Hey, Mark.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.601
Hey, William.

24:12.049 --> 24:15.564
Here we are.
Now, les check in your guns.

24:15.729 --> 24:19.244
- I think we'll keep our guns.
- Then get off my island.

24:19.729 --> 24:23.358
- Is okay, Juan. I'll sign off on it.
- No, Frank. I won't.

24:23.529 --> 24:26.441
I don't care if she is
a supreme court justice.

24:26.609 --> 24:28.884
- No disrespect intended.
- None taken.

24:29.049 --> 24:30.277
This is my island.

24:30.449 --> 24:34.442
As long as is my watch,
only me and my boys go strapped.

24:37.049 --> 24:39.517
What is it they call you?

24:40.409 --> 24:43.367
- El Fuego.
- The fire?

24:47.449 --> 24:49.679
Do what he says.

26:05.649 --> 26:07.162
Yo, Sasch!

26:07.329 --> 26:09.001
Yeah.

26:09.729 --> 26:13.278
I really messed things up
this time, didn't I?

26:14.489 --> 26:16.559
Yes, you did.

26:20.569 --> 26:23.561
I'm starting to miss the love
from the streets.

26:23.729 --> 26:26.163
Thas gonna be an issue, isn't it?

26:26.329 --> 26:31.244
What you think, man? I can't
do no five years in this joint.

26:31.409 --> 26:33.877
Here, player. Read a book.

26:34.689 --> 26:37.362
Whas this, man?

26:37.689 --> 26:41.079
- When Lovers Colllde.
- Is a good book.

26:41.249 --> 26:42.762
You can't be serious.

26:42.929 --> 26:47.559
Petrosevitch, get up.
Someone wants to see you.

27:47.569 --> 27:48.638
Hello, Jenny.

27:48.809 --> 27:52.165
- Please Identlfy yourself.
- Kestner, Damon J.

27:52.329 --> 27:55.401
Volce and handprlnt
recognltlon conflrmed.

28:06.809 --> 28:10.882
- How much time do you need?
- Phones are easy. Alarms worry me.

28:11.049 --> 28:13.961
I gotta crack the firewall,
decode and override.

28:14.129 --> 28:17.121
I don't care how you do it.
Do it in 90 seconds.

28:17.289 --> 28:20.565
- Tie me off.
- Ninety seconds.

28:26.689 --> 28:30.045
- Welcome to Slaughterhouse Five.
- Why they call it that?

28:30.209 --> 28:34.487
A man can be executed five ways.
Lethal injection's the most popular...

28:34.649 --> 28:38.642
...followed by gas chamber, hanging,
firing squad and my favourite:

28:40.769 --> 28:41.758
Electrocution.

28:41.929 --> 28:46.127
We do It all here In thls totally
soundproof Isolatlon chamber.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.723
We even let
the condemned man choose.

28:48.889 --> 28:52.120
- Who is that?
- Number 1137.

28:52.289 --> 28:53.802
Whas he doing here?

28:53.969 --> 28:59.089
When a man asks for someone
to spend his last hour with, you do it.

29:01.209 --> 29:05.566
Access granted.
Securlty protocols dlsabled.

29:06.929 --> 29:08.157
Take me up!

29:15.889 --> 29:18.562
- 49er Six to 49er One.
- This is One. Over.

29:18.729 --> 29:23.678
- That was a hell of a sunset.
- They're always nice before a storm.

29:49.609 --> 29:52.840
- You believe in God, Sascha?
- Most of the time.

29:53.009 --> 29:56.206
Ever fly in your dreams?

29:57.809 --> 30:02.200
- Who is this guy?
- I'm a man with 50 minutes to live.

30:02.369 --> 30:04.803
What does that have to do with me?

30:07.809 --> 30:10.960
Change the view, will you?
I'm tired of this one.

30:11.129 --> 30:14.201
- What would you prefer, Lester?
- The desert.

30:14.369 --> 30:17.167
- How does that sound?
- Hot.

30:17.329 --> 30:20.639
The rumour is you went
half past dead and came back.

30:20.809 --> 30:24.199
Took a ride on the flat line
for 22 minutes...

30:24.369 --> 30:26.758
...and lived to tell.

30:27.289 --> 30:31.362
Thought we could play some cards
and talk about that.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.527
Whoever wired this place was good,
but you're the best.

30:59.689 --> 31:01.600
- Thas why you hired me.
- Exactly.

31:01.769 --> 31:03.088
49er One to 49er Six. You ready?

31:03.249 --> 31:05.240
If you're waiting on us,
you're back and up.

31:05.409 --> 31:07.127
Les party, boys.

31:19.369 --> 31:23.408
- Excuse me, sir. I need to talk to you.
- Whas up?

31:23.809 --> 31:27.484
- I can't reach the control centre.
- What about the alarms?

31:27.649 --> 31:30.766
I ran a systems check.
The radar's reading normal.

31:30.929 --> 31:32.647
- Cell houses?
- No breaches.

31:32.809 --> 31:37.883
The storm must have knocked out
the phone lines. Okay. Graclas.

31:39.049 --> 31:40.960
Billy Ray, check it out.

33:12.049 --> 33:14.244
I'm with y'all. I'm one of y'all.

33:15.169 --> 33:18.923
- Sorry.
- Check this out. Let me out of here.

33:19.089 --> 33:22.479
- Cell house secured.
- Thas my girl.

33:25.809 --> 33:30.087
Hey, whas up, doll?
Give me one of them pistols, man.

33:33.009 --> 33:36.001
- Whas that?
- Whas it look like?

33:36.169 --> 33:38.444
Is the suit I promised you.

33:39.129 --> 33:43.088
Is not first-class,
but is a good knockoff.

33:48.889 --> 33:51.642
You know, I volunteered for this.

33:51.809 --> 33:57.247
I got tired of parading in and out of
court, hawking appeals, filing writs.

33:57.409 --> 34:00.401
What am I doing?
I'm displacing blame.

34:00.569 --> 34:04.005
So I decided to accept
my karmic payback.

34:04.169 --> 34:06.160
Now I'm not so sure.

34:06.329 --> 34:09.081
Dying's not the hard part.

34:09.529 --> 34:12.804
Is knowing that your life
doesn't belong to you.

34:12.969 --> 34:18.089
That your death has an exact time and
date takes all the mystery out of it.

34:18.809 --> 34:22.597
Thought about doing it myself,
but I couldn't.

34:25.329 --> 34:28.366
Whas waiting on the other side?

34:29.768 --> 34:32.237
Not too many people
know that, Lester.

34:32.409 --> 34:36.038
Come on. Be generous.
My time's precious.

34:36.688 --> 34:40.523
Tell me how it feels
to be embraced by the light.

34:40.688 --> 34:43.647
Do your loved ones come for you?

35:07.409 --> 35:08.842
Got any jacks?

35:12.209 --> 35:13.688
Anybody hit?

35:13.849 --> 35:15.805
Seven's down.

35:19.129 --> 35:21.040
He's your man.

35:21.889 --> 35:24.084
Sleep tight, friend.

35:32.569 --> 35:35.879
- Wanna know why I'm in that chair?
- No.

35:36.049 --> 35:37.801
I hit a U.S. money train...

35:37.969 --> 35:42.599
...and ripped off 200 million worth
of U.S. gold brick.

35:43.089 --> 35:48.209
- You must have done more than that.
- The deal went sideways on me.

35:48.369 --> 35:53.682
Train got accidentally derailed.
Five U.S. Treasury agents got killed.

35:56.329 --> 35:58.320
Feds have been coming all week...

35:58.489 --> 36:02.038
...promising me serenity
if I tell them where I hid it.

36:02.209 --> 36:05.485
You think Goďll go easier
on me if I do?

36:06.729 --> 36:09.801
I think you must have done
something very bad...

36:09.969 --> 36:13.962
...and now you're gonna pay
for it with your life.

36:15.689 --> 36:18.408
But I think God will forgive you.

36:19.769 --> 36:24.559
- Air 49er, whas your air to ground?
- I got zero visibility.

36:24.729 --> 36:27.926
- Give me a ballpark ETA.
- My ETA's been pushed.

36:28.089 --> 36:31.604
- We're gettlng close. Push back.
- I'm on my way.

36:38.449 --> 36:42.442
Lester, there is someone
here to see you.

36:45.489 --> 36:47.400
Hello, Lester.

36:48.649 --> 36:54.167
"Whosoever sheds man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."

36:54.969 --> 36:57.164
Genesis 9, verse 6.

36:57.329 --> 37:01.447
You read that the day you decided
my life wasn't worth living.

37:01.609 --> 37:04.203
The jury decided. I presided.

37:11.089 --> 37:13.125
Is okay.

37:18.929 --> 37:24.003
You're a long way from Pennsylvania
Avenue. Why'd you make the trip?

37:24.209 --> 37:27.884
Because of that ruling
I made 17 years ago.

37:29.569 --> 37:33.767
You want my forgiveness.
Thas why you came, isn't it?

37:40.249 --> 37:43.047
It was my job to sentence you.

37:43.209 --> 37:47.839
Now that your death warrans come
down, is my job to see it through.

37:48.009 --> 37:51.081
Well, thas very honourable of you.

37:53.369 --> 37:54.927
Goodbye, Lester.

38:09.089 --> 38:10.602
Les go, Petrosevitch.

38:21.969 --> 38:23.687
What the hell?

39:03.449 --> 39:05.405
Any last words?

39:07.729 --> 39:09.959
Thanks for the suit.

39:27.889 --> 39:30.483
- Whas that?
- What the hell?

39:33.809 --> 39:35.401
Nice suit.

39:35.569 --> 39:38.766
- Show us what you got.
- Get your ass up there.

39:38.929 --> 39:41.443
- Come on, man.
- Come on. Come on.

39:47.369 --> 39:49.166
- Oh, dude.
- Damn.

39:51.129 --> 39:52.687
Your turn, Little Joe.

39:53.609 --> 39:56.442
My big black ass up that rope?

39:58.929 --> 40:00.567
Goddamn, Joe.

40:00.729 --> 40:04.608
What about you, you little bitch?
Give it a try, les go!

40:04.769 --> 40:09.001
- Up!
- No. Not me.

40:09.169 --> 40:11.239
Thas not what I'm gonna do.

40:11.729 --> 40:15.404
But you, you know,
you should climb on up there.

40:15.569 --> 40:18.288
I'm gonna go over here myself...

40:18.929 --> 40:22.285
...and watch you fall
and bust your ass...

40:23.089 --> 40:25.967
...you little bitch.

40:29.809 --> 40:32.846
What are you doing, man?
Let it go!

40:44.689 --> 40:47.078
49er One to Alr 49er.
Whas your 20? Over.

40:47.249 --> 40:51.208
According to radar, I'm over you.
But I'm in a total whiteout.

40:51.369 --> 40:55.203
Take your eyes off of the radar
and look for the lighthouse.

40:59.409 --> 41:01.365
No!

41:03.489 --> 41:05.241
Whas going on up there?

41:32.929 --> 41:35.238
I think we just lost our ride.

41:43.689 --> 41:46.408
Oh, man. You all see this?

42:02.569 --> 42:04.446
Please Identlfy yourself.

42:04.609 --> 42:07.681
- Kestner, Damon J.
- Access denled.

42:07.849 --> 42:10.044
You gotta say it louder.

42:10.209 --> 42:12.165
Kestner, Damon J.

42:13.649 --> 42:16.322
Volce and handprlnt
recognltlon conflrmed.

42:43.009 --> 42:44.920
Let me handle this guy.

42:46.809 --> 42:48.800
Make sure he's dead.

42:52.809 --> 42:55.039
Let it be. Is blood money.

42:55.569 --> 42:58.879
Got yourself born again
since you came to prison?

42:59.049 --> 43:01.927
I found God, yes.

43:02.529 --> 43:03.678
There is no God.

43:03.849 --> 43:05.885
I told you no last week.

43:06.049 --> 43:10.679
If you're going to kill me, do it.
I'm dead already.

43:22.969 --> 43:26.120
Are you going to take me
to the gold? Yes or no?

43:28.209 --> 43:31.326
Yes or no?

43:41.609 --> 43:44.169
I can't kill you, Lester.

43:44.329 --> 43:45.967
I need you.

43:46.529 --> 43:50.568
But there's a lot of innocent
people here I just don't need.

43:53.489 --> 43:57.004
I'm what shrinks call sociopathic.
Know what that means?

43:57.169 --> 44:02.118
It means I can kill everybody
in this room and not feel bad about it.

44:02.569 --> 44:03.797
But you...

44:04.889 --> 44:08.006
...you had to find God
to get over your guilt.

44:11.569 --> 44:13.366
But God is dead.

44:15.569 --> 44:20.802
And so is everybody in this room
if you don't take me where I wanna go.

44:48.689 --> 44:49.758
What you got?

44:49.929 --> 44:52.807
Coast Guard reports a
helicopter went down.

44:52.969 --> 44:55.199
- Any word from Alcatraz?
- Phones are down.

44:55.369 --> 44:56.358
Convenient.

44:56.529 --> 44:59.327
- A cell house was compromised.
- Which one?

44:59.489 --> 45:02.606
E-Block. Is temporary while
they retrofit the main house.

45:02.769 --> 45:04.521
- Is he in there?
- Cell A-5.

45:04.689 --> 45:06.759
- Who?
- We got a man in deep cover.

45:06.929 --> 45:08.965
- As a prisoner?
- Yeah.

45:09.609 --> 45:12.282
What kind of man signs up for that?

46:52.209 --> 46:56.122
Hey, mama. You got
that blue stuff working, huh?

48:03.089 --> 48:06.764
49er Six to 49er One.
I think is time for plan B.

48:08.049 --> 48:09.926
- How bad?
- Total loss.

48:10.089 --> 48:11.886
All right, get back here.

48:12.049 --> 48:14.961
Sexy little thing, you.

48:20.369 --> 48:22.121
Let me see that gun, mama.

48:24.529 --> 48:28.044
- Les get ready for the FBI.
- Right.

48:41.289 --> 48:43.325
We got something.

48:52.809 --> 48:55.039
- What is it?
- Cellular transmission.

48:55.209 --> 48:58.246
- Start the trace. Put them on speaker.
- You're live.

48:58.409 --> 49:00.684
This is Special Agent Williams, FBI.

49:00.849 --> 49:03.886
Les not be so formal,
Special Agent Williams.

49:04.049 --> 49:07.121
- I like first names.
- All right. My name's Ellen.

49:07.289 --> 49:09.803
- Les talk hostages.
- I've got 10.

49:09.969 --> 49:12.039
- How many women?
- Three.

49:12.209 --> 49:15.326
- Show good faith. Let the women go.
- Relax, Ellen.

49:15.849 --> 49:17.965
Everything in time.

49:19.249 --> 49:21.638
Tell me what you're doing.

49:21.809 --> 49:25.518
You a bad boy who didn't get
enough love from his mother?

49:25.689 --> 49:29.238
Maybe trying to prove a point?
Teach Uncle Sam a lesson?

49:29.409 --> 49:31.969
Oh, no. I love America.

49:32.129 --> 49:34.279
- Then whas your cause?
- Me.

49:34.449 --> 49:38.840
- And who are you?
- Who I am is not important.

49:40.729 --> 49:42.481
But who I have...

49:43.169 --> 49:46.844
...and what you're gonna
give me for her is.

50:20.529 --> 50:22.963
Easy, now. I'm just
looking for my men.

50:23.489 --> 50:25.480
They're all dead.

50:26.929 --> 50:28.999
Get her, and throw her down here.

50:29.169 --> 50:30.443
Who are you?

50:30.609 --> 50:32.361
Eleven-thirty-seven.

50:33.009 --> 50:35.079
Eleven-thirty-seven?

50:35.569 --> 50:37.127
Bust her, Sasch!

50:58.769 --> 51:00.327
Little Joe!

51:01.529 --> 51:02.882
Yo, Nick.

51:04.169 --> 51:07.400
- You got this little freak handled?
- I got her.

51:07.569 --> 51:09.560
Yo, we got your back, dog.

51:28.569 --> 51:31.845
Whas the matter, baby girl,
you don't like me?

51:35.769 --> 51:38.920
I thought you liked me.
Come on, you little freak.

52:16.449 --> 52:18.724
Nice shooting, Ma.

52:18.889 --> 52:21.449
You just shot up a room full of cans.

52:22.489 --> 52:25.162
Why don't we put the guns down...

52:25.809 --> 52:28.562
...and do this like men?

52:35.729 --> 52:37.481
You first.

53:57.489 --> 54:00.561
- I'm telling you.
- You all right?

54:00.729 --> 54:02.606
I'm all right, man...

54:02.969 --> 54:04.800
...but we got issues.

54:07.169 --> 54:12.243
You llsten carefully. Here's what you'll
glve us In exchange for the hostages.

54:12.409 --> 54:16.687
A hellcopter rlde off thls rock
and a fuelled jet waltlng...

54:16.849 --> 54:19.409
...to tak e us
to an undlsclosed locatlon.

54:19.569 --> 54:22.561
I can't approve those
demands without authorization.

54:22.929 --> 54:25.602
- Then get authorized.
- I need time.

54:25.769 --> 54:28.408
You're boring me
with these stall tactics.

54:28.569 --> 54:32.847
Put your playbook down, and give
the attorney general a wakeup call.

54:33.009 --> 54:36.126
- What if he doesn't meet your demands?
- I start target practlce.

54:36.289 --> 54:40.077
And don't try that Waco, Texas
Special-Op stuff, either...

54:40.849 --> 54:44.159
...or I'll light this justice up.
- Light her up?

54:44.329 --> 54:46.160
Let me give you the visual.

54:46.929 --> 54:51.719
As we speak, Miss McPherson's
strapped to the electric chair.

54:52.369 --> 54:56.567
All I have to do is flip a switch
and, well, she's dead.

54:57.009 --> 54:59.728
Dead by the tool of her trade.

55:01.289 --> 55:05.282
Now send me my helicopter
before I start filling body bags.

55:05.449 --> 55:10.762
Put Special Ops on a "Will notify."
Find out who the phone's registered to.

55:10.929 --> 55:12.920
Computer's printing it out now.

55:19.009 --> 55:22.046
- Nothing's ever easy, huh?
- Not today.

55:22.209 --> 55:23.767
Hang on to this.

55:26.849 --> 55:30.478
- Come on, dog.
- Do it, dog.

55:30.769 --> 55:32.680
You ain't gonna make it.

55:37.209 --> 55:40.326
Yo, you bust a cap
in that freaky bitch, or what?

55:40.569 --> 55:41.888
Or what.

55:47.409 --> 55:49.843
- We lost 3, 4 and 5.
- How?

55:50.009 --> 55:52.045
Prisoner 1137.

56:01.649 --> 56:03.480
Who's 1137?

56:04.089 --> 56:06.000
A major pain in your ass.

56:06.889 --> 56:09.562
You think you're funny now?

56:15.969 --> 56:17.607
Sascha, is that you?

56:17.769 --> 56:20.408
How does one of the FBI's
finest marksmen...

56:20.569 --> 56:24.005
...shoot an undercover agent?
- I don't have time for this.

56:24.169 --> 56:27.286
Some nut says he's gonna waste
a supreme court justice.

56:27.449 --> 56:28.643
Give me the 411.

56:28.809 --> 56:32.518
These guys are 10, 15 strong,
minus the three I took out.

56:32.689 --> 56:34.441
- Do they have McPherson?
- I don't know.

56:34.609 --> 56:38.443
But I'll tell you one thing,
they're very heavily armed.

56:39.049 --> 56:40.038
Hey.

56:41.609 --> 56:44.169
- Whas going on?
- Welcome to the party.

56:44.369 --> 56:47.566
- Glad you could make it.
- What are you doing, Donny?

56:47.729 --> 56:50.038
Put your weapons down!

56:52.729 --> 56:56.483
About time you boys grew some hair
on your chest. Now what?

56:56.689 --> 56:58.088
Put your weapons down.

57:03.249 --> 57:06.685
Don't stop now. You started out
with such authority...

57:06.969 --> 57:10.882
...such conviction. Keep it going.
- Here's how is gonna go.

57:11.049 --> 57:15.645
You're gonna unstrap Miss McPherson
and we're gonna walk her out of here.

57:15.809 --> 57:18.448
What do you think, Miss Jane?

57:18.649 --> 57:20.879
Do it now!

57:36.049 --> 57:40.281
You gave it a try, boys.
I can respect that.

57:40.489 --> 57:42.559
But I don't take orders.

57:47.729 --> 57:50.766
Happy you wore that body armour?

57:53.809 --> 57:57.358
What am I doing here?
Well, let me see.

57:57.529 --> 58:01.044
I'm gonna dig up $200 million
worth of U.S. gold brick...

58:01.329 --> 58:05.368
...take an early retirement south
of the border. Work on my tan.

58:05.529 --> 58:07.406
- You want in?
- I'm not dirty.

58:07.609 --> 58:10.840
- Well, I am.
- Why? You were treated good.

58:11.049 --> 58:15.565
65G a year and a watch when I'm 60
won't get me a piece of the rock.

58:15.729 --> 58:20.678
I want the American dream, Frank.
And I'm gonna get it.

58:21.009 --> 58:23.921
Donald Robert Johnson, age 33.

Last 18 months, working at the Federal
Bureau of Prisons. Can you help?

58:37.729 --> 58:39.685
- I can try.
- Without compromising...

58:39.849 --> 58:42.966
...the life of Jane McPherson?
- I'll use a soft hammer.

58:43.169 --> 58:46.798
- You don't own one.
- Besides me, what are your options?

58:47.009 --> 58:49.364
- Special Ops.
- They'll see them comlng.

58:49.529 --> 58:52.885
- I could meet their demands.
- What if they kill her anyway?

58:53.049 --> 58:56.519
I'll be pushing pencils
for the rest of my career.

58:56.689 --> 59:00.682
- Sounds like I'm all you've got.
- This is heavy, Sascha.

59:00.849 --> 59:01.964
I'll be in touch.

59:03.089 --> 59:06.604
This some tasty stuff, dog.
Come peep it out.

59:06.769 --> 59:08.282
Look at this.

59:08.449 --> 59:11.043
Put that down before
you hurt somebody.

59:11.249 --> 59:12.887
I got no beef with you.

59:13.089 --> 59:15.205
Put it down before you
blow your dick off.

59:15.409 --> 59:18.719
How's he gonna do that, Joe?
Targes too small.

59:20.969 --> 59:23.847
Mine's bigger than yours,
little big-city boy.

59:25.329 --> 59:28.401
- You know you got problems?
- Whas the problem?

59:28.609 --> 59:32.648
- Twitch wants to blow something up.
- He wanna blow some shit up.

59:32.809 --> 59:35.403
- You wanna blow something up?
- Hell, yeah.

59:35.569 --> 59:39.198
Put this on your shoulder.
Put your index finger here.

59:39.409 --> 59:42.162
Line that up nice.
Right about like that.

59:42.369 --> 59:45.042
- Sayonara, you little busters.
- Let her rip.

59:57.649 --> 01:00:00.038
Get him out of here, man.

01:00:00.609 --> 01:00:02.247
You all right?

01:00:02.409 --> 01:00:05.879
- Told you about pushing buttons.
- What a rush.

01:00:15.889 --> 01:00:18.847
All right, boys. Pick your poison.

01:00:19.009 --> 01:00:23.241
- So we giving these wackos guns?
- We need all the help we can get.

01:00:23.729 --> 01:00:26.641
- What happened up in the chopper?
- Radioed for backup.

01:00:27.409 --> 01:00:29.843
- Hey, Sasch.
- Yeah?

01:00:30.649 --> 01:00:32.640
You like that?

01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:35.084
Think I can do some damage
with this one?

01:00:35.249 --> 01:00:36.523
- This mine?
- Take it.

01:00:36.689 --> 01:00:38.441
Oh, you the man, Sasch.

01:00:38.609 --> 01:00:41.965
- Twitch is in the house.
- This weapon was made for you.

01:00:42.129 --> 01:00:45.360
- Small and compact.
- Little and mean.

01:00:47.489 --> 01:00:49.639
This some crazy shit, Sasch.

01:00:49.809 --> 01:00:53.279
- Cuckoo crazy.
- Way beyond that.

01:00:53.489 --> 01:00:55.127
Why are you doing this?

01:00:57.969 --> 01:01:01.041
Little late in the game
for that, isn't it?

01:01:01.529 --> 01:01:03.724
Haven't you been paying attention?

01:01:03.889 --> 01:01:05.925
Well, we know you want the gold.

01:01:06.089 --> 01:01:08.045
But you're more than greedy.

01:01:08.529 --> 01:01:12.841
There must be some reason for that.
What happened to you?

01:01:13.249 --> 01:01:17.447
Feel like I should be laying on
a couch with a box of Kleenex.

01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:20.362
Talking about how my father beat me.

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:23.483
- Or about how my mother raped me.
- Did they?

01:01:29.649 --> 01:01:32.607
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:39.280
Tell me, how many candles did they
put on your birthday cake this year?

01:01:39.449 --> 01:01:42.566
I know is not polite to ask
a woman her age...

01:01:42.729 --> 01:01:46.608
...but you're not hung up on
superficial things like that, right?

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:49.806
Youngest supreme court justice ever.

01:01:49.969 --> 01:01:53.405
One of only three women
ever appointed.

01:01:54.409 --> 01:01:57.321
You're gonna be in the
history books one day.

01:01:58.129 --> 01:02:00.643
I'm 53.

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.648
Fifty-three.

01:02:06.369 --> 01:02:09.805
You sure are an attractive 53 too.

01:02:11.249 --> 01:02:15.481
Little long in the tooth for my taste,
but let me see.

01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:19.560
Yes.

01:02:19.729 --> 01:02:22.641
You have kept your bait fresh.

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:27.167
You're probably pretty smart too.

01:02:28.049 --> 01:02:30.165
So tell me...

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:35.522
...why have you
never been married?

01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:38.720
No one ever asked me.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:42.565
Too busy burning bras?

01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:47.439
Getting your panties in a twist over
women's rights, equal pay, pro-choice.

01:02:47.609 --> 01:02:49.759
Fighting the cause, right?

01:02:50.929 --> 01:02:53.489
And all that time...

01:02:55.809 --> 01:02:58.528
...you forgot about love,
didn't you?

01:03:00.809 --> 01:03:04.006
And your biological clock
stopped ticking.

01:03:06.329 --> 01:03:08.968
Your fields went fallow.

01:03:09.769 --> 01:03:15.127
And now, in the autumn
of your historic life...

01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:22.117
...you ain't got nothing.

01:03:22.969 --> 01:03:25.278
Do you, Miss Jane?

01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:27.878
Not even a dog.

01:03:32.849 --> 01:03:35.488
I have my work.

01:03:36.409 --> 01:03:40.766
Thas my story. Whas yours?

01:03:41.809 --> 01:03:46.644
Sorry to disappoint you after your
candour and all the tears falling down.

01:03:46.809 --> 01:03:50.165
There is no deep psychological
reason for my behaviour.

01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:53.089
I just saw a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I took it.

01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:54.204
I just saw a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I took it.

01:04:18.089 --> 01:04:19.283
We've got her!

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:22.039
Come on. Come on. Come on down!

01:04:25.009 --> 01:04:26.681
Get these doors open!

01:04:26.889 --> 01:04:30.677
- Take Lester and get out!
- I'm not leaving without you.

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:35.406
Please help me. Get me out of here.

01:04:35.609 --> 01:04:37.042
Get them open now!

01:04:38.009 --> 01:04:38.998
I'll be back!

01:04:43.049 --> 01:04:45.404
Give me that rifle!

01:04:45.809 --> 01:04:47.606
Come on.

01:04:48.849 --> 01:04:49.838
Bring her up.

01:05:18.769 --> 01:05:22.159
- Something wrong out there?
- Nope. Everything's peachy.

01:05:22.369 --> 01:05:24.439
Then why am I talking to you?
Who are you?

01:05:24.649 --> 01:05:26.321
I'm second in command.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.400
Where's our helicopter?

01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:30.880
We've still got 36 minutes.

01:05:31.089 --> 01:05:34.604
You're a woman, which means
you know we don't like to wait.

01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:37.727
So get the chopper airborne now.

01:05:39.209 --> 01:05:41.723
Or I will fry this lily-white bitch.

01:05:46.889 --> 01:05:48.959
Send the chopper.

01:08:30.488 --> 01:08:34.926
- Don't even think about it!
- Your clip's dry, 1137. You know it.

01:08:35.249 --> 01:08:36.318
Do you think so?

01:08:36.689 --> 01:08:39.920
Yeah. You'd have used it
by now if it wasn't.

01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:42.082
Are you sure?

01:08:43.288 --> 01:08:44.688
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.120
Thas right. Magazine's dry.

01:08:49.288 --> 01:08:52.326
Question is, do I still have
one in the tube?

01:08:54.169 --> 01:08:55.568
I say you're dry.

01:08:56.129 --> 01:08:57.357
Make your move.

01:09:10.089 --> 01:09:13.968
- Thas a nice bluff.
- Wasn't a bluff. It was a misfire.

01:09:14.488 --> 01:09:15.683
Where's Lester?

01:09:16.049 --> 01:09:17.607
Find him yourself.

01:09:20.769 --> 01:09:22.327
Sweet dreams, partner.

01:09:38.448 --> 01:09:40.201
Damn!

01:09:43.089 --> 01:09:45.398
Yo, Sasch. You need to holler at me.

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:47.161
- Later.
- No, now.

01:09:47.328 --> 01:09:50.957
- I need to know whas going on.
- Watch my back like usual.

01:09:51.129 --> 01:09:54.883
I got your back. Thas a given.
I need to know the game plan.

01:09:55.089 --> 01:09:57.842
I'm on a tight clock, man.
I don't got time.

01:09:58.009 --> 01:10:02.878
Are you hiding something from me?
I get the feeling like you are.

01:10:04.969 --> 01:10:09.884
Nothing. I'm trying to save the life
of a supreme court justice.

01:10:10.049 --> 01:10:12.847
- There's more.
- Now's not the time, brother.

01:10:13.169 --> 01:10:14.841
Yes, it is.

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:20.568
I'm undercover.

01:10:23.609 --> 01:10:25.645
FBI.

01:10:26.449 --> 01:10:30.647
- But you passed the lie detector test.
- Anybody can do that.

01:10:33.049 --> 01:10:37.122
All this time, you've been
setting up on me.

01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:47.157
I believed in you.

01:10:48.489 --> 01:10:49.683
I trusted you.

01:10:51.089 --> 01:10:54.240
I've let you into my family.
I vouched for you.

01:10:57.929 --> 01:10:59.965
And you betrayed me?

01:11:00.569 --> 01:11:02.366
Is not that simple.

01:11:04.489 --> 01:11:06.081
Don't do it.

01:11:15.089 --> 01:11:16.966
Well, I'm sorry.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:28.527
I thought we were friends, Sasch.

01:11:31.129 --> 01:11:35.407
We are. You can bet
your life on that.

01:11:46.689 --> 01:11:49.647
- Is the helicopter here?
- Yeah. Where's Lester?

01:11:49.809 --> 01:11:51.640
I've got hlm.

01:11:59.049 --> 01:12:01.483
You've got something of mine, 1137.

01:12:02.169 --> 01:12:03.238
I want It back.

01:12:03.449 --> 01:12:05.804
I'll swap you.
Lester for the judge.

01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:11.648
- What do you want the judge for?
- She's my tlck et out of here.

01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:15.524
You glve me Lester, and we'll
let you thumb a rlde wlth us.

01:12:15.889 --> 01:12:19.848
Hitchhiking's dangerous. Didn't
your mama ever tell you that?

01:12:22.049 --> 01:12:26.565
- When and where?
- Main cell house, 15 minutes.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.284
Fifteen minutes.

01:12:34.649 --> 01:12:37.083
Unstrap the judge.

01:12:44.729 --> 01:12:48.608
Get fired up, boys. He took the bait.

01:12:51.809 --> 01:12:55.597
Hey, how do I look?

01:12:56.929 --> 01:13:00.001
Like a big-ass prom queen.

01:13:06.289 --> 01:13:08.849
You sure you want to do this?

01:13:09.049 --> 01:13:12.883
My destiny is in Goďs hands.
I'm cool with that.

01:13:13.649 --> 01:13:18.723
Now, I want to tell you
about a place I used to go.

01:13:18.889 --> 01:13:22.279
Is an alpine lake called Trinity,
west of Shasta.

01:13:23.329 --> 01:13:26.719
There's a little cove on the
north bank, tucked away.

01:13:27.129 --> 01:13:30.121
You should take a trip there
when this is over.

01:13:30.929 --> 01:13:33.762
Trinity Lake, west of Shasta.

01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:37.285
Take the trip.

01:13:48.369 --> 01:13:51.327
- Is him.
- What the hell's going on out there?

01:13:51.489 --> 01:13:54.526
- I got everythlng under control.
- Any good news?

01:13:54.729 --> 01:13:58.688
I'm trading the condemned man
for McPherson. You happy?

01:13:58.849 --> 01:13:59.838
Thrilled.

01:14:00.009 --> 01:14:02.000
Give them their chopper.

01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:06.885
I already did all that. I'm sorry
I'm yelling. I'm a little edgy.

01:14:07.089 --> 01:14:09.205
Don't worry. I got it handled.

01:14:21.769 --> 01:14:24.124
Hey. You got room for two in there?

01:14:29.969 --> 01:14:31.607
There is now.

01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:48.441
You know, you gotta break
a few things down to me, man.

01:14:51.889 --> 01:14:55.848
What am I doing here? Earning
your trust, maintaining my cover.

01:14:56.769 --> 01:14:58.646
You already screwed that up.

01:14:59.409 --> 01:15:01.684
The Bureau thought
if we did time together...

01:15:01.849 --> 01:15:05.762
...you'd trust me with more
information back out on the streets.

01:15:08.889 --> 01:15:10.845
You want Sonny that bad?

01:15:12.289 --> 01:15:14.245
My wife's dead because of him.

01:15:14.569 --> 01:15:19.563
She died after one of his men jacked my
car and put four bullets in her chest.

01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:24.241
You bet your life I want him that bad.

01:15:25.649 --> 01:15:27.765
I'm sorry, man. I didn't know.

01:15:29.769 --> 01:15:32.078
I don't know.

01:15:34.049 --> 01:15:36.802
She was the best part of me.

01:15:52.929 --> 01:15:56.763
- All right. Put this helmet on.
- Whas this do?

01:15:56.929 --> 01:16:00.160
- Whatever you look at, you can shoot.
- Yeah?

01:16:01.329 --> 01:16:04.127
Targetlng eyeplece actlvated.

01:16:10.529 --> 01:16:13.123
This is just like a video game.

01:17:23.449 --> 01:17:25.804
I'm gonna mak e thls real slmple.

01:17:25.969 --> 01:17:28.767
You send us the judge,
we'll send you Lester.

01:17:38.729 --> 01:17:40.685
Start walking.

01:17:42.849 --> 01:17:46.205
- Go with God, my brother.
- Always.

01:18:38.049 --> 01:18:40.279
- Get him out of here.
- Got her, boss.

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.599
- Les move.
- Go. Go, go, go.

01:18:44.529 --> 01:18:45.518
Les go, boys.

01:19:03.569 --> 01:19:07.244
All right, homeys, you did good.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.365
Real good.

01:19:09.769 --> 01:19:14.081
Now give up your guns,
or two things can happen.

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.639
You get killed, or you get caught.

01:19:21.009 --> 01:19:26.129
He's right. They kept their word,
now les keep ours. Let them go.

01:19:37.689 --> 01:19:39.645
Comprende this!

01:19:47.889 --> 01:19:48.958
Cease fire!

01:20:16.849 --> 01:20:18.760
Y'all want some?

01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:22.167

01:20:42.689 --> 01:20:44.202
God!

01:21:02.929 --> 01:21:03.998
Cover me!

01:21:09.329 --> 01:21:11.320
We got a problem.

01:21:11.809 --> 01:21:13.527
Acqulrlng target.

01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:24.841
You mother...

01:21:25.409 --> 01:21:28.082
- Problem solved.
- You're bad.

01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:44.164
Yeah. Yeah!

01:21:46.569 --> 01:21:50.039
- We gotta do something.
- Stay here or jump for that rope.

01:21:50.209 --> 01:21:51.403
Either way, we die.

01:21:54.489 --> 01:21:56.798
I guess we're going for the rope.

01:22:00.889 --> 01:22:02.117
Get out of there!

01:22:28.489 --> 01:22:31.162
Pretty good, 1137.

01:22:31.889 --> 01:22:34.323
But not good enough.

01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:37.207
Drop it!

01:22:37.409 --> 01:22:38.922
I said, drop it!

01:22:44.969 --> 01:22:46.084
Oh, hell, yeah!

01:22:52.449 --> 01:22:54.201
Thas what you get, bitch!

01:23:07.409 --> 01:23:11.482
Les see if you got the sack
to finish the job.

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:15.245
Don't do it.

01:23:38.929 --> 01:23:43.002
- I got something...
- Put the gun down. Now.

01:23:47.249 --> 01:23:49.888
McPherson's in the last cell
on the right.

01:23:50.049 --> 01:23:51.402
Come on!

01:23:51.569 --> 01:23:54.288
We all right.
Everything's good in the 'hood.

01:24:09.569 --> 01:24:12.561
- Did we get them?
- Yeah, we got them.

01:24:13.409 --> 01:24:17.960
- I'm gonna miss you, Sasch.
- Don't say that, man.

01:24:18.209 --> 01:24:20.040
Is a nice night to die.

01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:23.804
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:24:23.969 --> 01:24:26.358
Get me the hell out of here.

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:29.965
You just hang in there for me.
You hear?

01:24:30.449 --> 01:24:32.201
Sascha.

01:24:36.369 --> 01:24:38.121
Thas not McPherson.

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:45.639

We've got company.

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:03.248
- Sorry your girlfriend died.
- Casualties of war.

01:25:03.409 --> 01:25:07.721
- You're not just a prisoner, are you?
- No, I'm not. Undercover FBI.

01:25:07.889 --> 01:25:13.202
- You picked the wrong prison.
- Don't get cocky. I got what you want.

01:25:13.489 --> 01:25:16.242
- I got what you need.
- Don't do it.

01:25:16.409 --> 01:25:19.640
Turn that helicopter around
or she goes for a swim.

01:25:19.809 --> 01:25:23.927
You wanna go for a swim?
I think she wants to go for a swim.

01:25:26.249 --> 01:25:27.443
Say goodbye.

01:28:16.009 --> 01:28:19.479
Almas nalgas, homeboy.
Someone here to see you.

01:29:01.329 --> 01:29:03.081
- Talk.
- How you feeling?

01:29:03.689 --> 01:29:05.998
Eight broken ribs...

01:29:06.569 --> 01:29:10.608
...a broken leg, a broken arm.
How'd you think I was feeling?

01:29:10.769 --> 01:29:14.887
Well, for the record,
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:29:17.249 --> 01:29:19.046
I heard you busted Sonny.

01:29:19.209 --> 01:29:23.885
Thas what I started out to do.
I usually like to finish what I start.

01:29:24.049 --> 01:29:26.005
Did you find the gold?

01:29:28.169 --> 01:29:31.445
- Did you get some for me?
- I got something better.

01:29:31.609 --> 01:29:34.203
- Whas that?
- I spoke with McPherson.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:36.803
- I had her look at your file.
- And?

01:29:36.969 --> 01:29:39.403
She knocked your sentence back.

01:29:39.969 --> 01:29:41.641
To what?

01:29:42.369 --> 01:29:45.600
How fast can you get out
of those clothes?

01:29:53.569 --> 01:29:57.482
- You better not be playing me.
- You know me. I ain't playing.

01:29:57.649 --> 01:29:59.367
You serious?

01:29:59.529 --> 01:30:02.566
Thas what I'm talking about!

01:30:03.209 --> 01:30:07.999
Now, Nicholas, do we have issues,
or are we all right?

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:11.161
Hell, no, we ain't all right.

01:30:15.609 --> 01:30:16.837
We all right.

01:30:37.529 --> 01:30:39.485
- Whas up, girl?
- Hey, Twitch.

01:30:39.649 --> 01:30:43.801
- " Hey"? You don't miss your boo?
- I miss you every day, Twitch.

01:30:43.969 --> 01:30:47.405
Dang, girl. Act like it.
After all I've been through.

01:30:47.569 --> 01:30:51.562
Please believe this. You gotta
believe it. It was cracking!

01:30:51.729 --> 01:30:55.483
It was down in here. Bullets flying.
I'm ducking bullets.

01:30:55.649 --> 01:30:58.288
Bad guys die.
I'm a good guy this time.

01:30:58.449 --> 01:31:02.283
I'm a hero. I'm big.
I'm getting out soon.

01:31:02.449 --> 01:31:05.202
Thas real! Me and the warden,
we like this.

01:31:05.369 --> 01:31:08.839
Twitch, the warden don't know you.
Your name is Bernard.

01:31:09.009 --> 01:31:12.558
- Don't talk about that.
- I'm stopping this Twitch mess.

01:31:12.729 --> 01:31:14.799
You keep hopping the same stuff.

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:18.882
- I'm tired of these fake-ass diamonds.
- They look real to me.

01:31:19.049 --> 01:31:21.165
Whas more real than Twitch?

01:31:21.329 --> 01:31:25.402
- Whas more real than Twitch Dog?
- Twitch Dog coming home.

01:31:25.569 --> 01:31:28.322
I'm coming home.
Put your hand on the glass.

01:31:28.489 --> 01:31:30.161
Put your hand on the glass.

01:31:30.329 --> 01:31:33.765
- Close your eyes.
- You're aggressive behind glass.

01:31:33.929 --> 01:31:38.081
Put your hand on the glass.
I want you to close your eyes.

01:31:38.249 --> 01:31:41.082
Close your eyes.
I want you to feel me.

01:31:41.249 --> 01:31:46.198
I'm coming home soon. I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go, okay?

01:31:46.369 --> 01:31:48.360
- Anywhere?
- Anywhere.

01:31:48.529 --> 01:31:52.204
- And I'm gonna buy you anything.
- Anything, Twitch?

01:31:52.369 --> 01:31:55.645
I met a million-dollar man.
I'm hitting his house.

01:31:55.809 --> 01:31:58.607
When you come home,
you be on the up and up.

01:31:58.769 --> 01:32:02.808
- Why you wanna hit the man?
- What the hell is you looking at?

01:32:02.969 --> 01:32:04.641
- Twitch!
- You in my zone!

01:32:04.809 --> 01:32:07.004
Bernard, here. See, here.

01:32:07.169 --> 01:32:11.208
You ain't never seen a lovely lady
before? You ill hustling.

01:32:11.369 --> 01:32:12.882
Twitch! Keep it here.

01:32:13.049 --> 01:32:18.169
Here! Keep it focused. Thas why
you're in here. You didn't listen.

01:32:18.329 --> 01:32:23.562
I'm with you, baby. You know.
I'll be home, now. You wait for me.

01:32:24.209 --> 01:32:27.087
You remember that time
we was by the beaches?

01:32:27.249 --> 01:32:30.480
You remember what we used
to do back in the day?

01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:32.526
Thas what I'm saying!

01:32:32.689 --> 01:32:36.682
Wiggle it for me. Show me some.
What the hell you looking at?

01:32:36.849 --> 01:32:40.637
Do the damn thing. Don't make
me go old school with you.

01:32:40.809 --> 01:32:42.003
Do the damn thing.

01:32:42.169 --> 01:32:44.637
Go ahead, girl.
Make them wiggle.
