00:52.955 --> 00:55.499
<i>I am Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan,</i>

00:55.624 --> 00:59.378
<i>Ibn Al Abbas, Ibn Rasid,
Ibn Hammad.</i>

00:59.461 --> 01:02.423
<i>And things were
not always thus.</i>

01:04.801 --> 01:07.387
<i>At one time,
I was a poet...</i>

01:07.470 --> 01:10.473
<i>in the greatest city
in the world.</i>

01:10.598 --> 01:14.519
<i>Life was easy,
and I lived without care...</i>

01:15.770 --> 01:18.106
<i>until one fateful day...</i>

01:18.273 --> 01:21.109
<i>I met a beautiful woman...</i>

01:21.192 --> 01:23.320
<i>who belonged to another man.</i>

01:25.322 --> 01:29.326
<i>Her jealous husband
complained to the Caliph...</i>

01:29.452 --> 01:33.748
<i>who made me the ambassador
to the land of the Tossuk Vlad...</i>

01:33.831 --> 01:37.668
<i>a country
far to the north.</i>

01:37.793 --> 01:40.254
<i>I was banished
from my home...</i>

01:40.379 --> 01:42.632
<i>and from all
that I knew.</i>

01:42.716 --> 01:47.971
<i>So, I journeyed by camelback many months
into the lands of barbarian peoples...</i>

01:48.096 --> 01:52.391
<i>accompanied by Melchisidek,
an old friend of my father...</i>

01:52.516 --> 01:56.645
<i>through the lands of the Ogus,
the Khazars and the Bulgars,</i>

01:56.812 --> 02:00.483
<i>into the lands of murderous bandits,
called "Tartars,"</i>

02:00.608 --> 02:04.196
<i>who attack caravans,
slaughtering everyone.</i>

02:04.321 --> 02:06.656
The Tartars are coming!

02:06.782 --> 02:08.991
The Tartars are coming!

02:09.076 --> 02:11.787
<i>The Tartars...</i>

02:11.870 --> 02:15.374
<i>Run! Run for your life!</i>

02:48.784 --> 02:51.620
<i>They have stopped.
They are not following.</i>

02:51.745 --> 02:55.040
<i>- A boat! A boat!
- They're Northmen! A boat!</i>

02:55.124 --> 02:57.543
<i>A boat! Over there!</i>

02:57.668 --> 03:00.338
<i>Look!
They are going!</i>

03:00.463 --> 03:03.717
<i>They are leaving!</i>

03:03.842 --> 03:08.179
Move! Move!
Keep moving!

03:08.263 --> 03:10.056
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Wait, wait, wait!

03:10.140 --> 03:12.392
Those men in the boat,
who are they?

03:12.475 --> 03:15.895
The Northmen.
Keep moving and keep quiet!

03:16.021 --> 03:17.939
Why?
Are they dangerous?

03:18.064 --> 03:22.278
<i>It depends. Maybe they'll let us go,
or maybe they'll kill us.</i>

03:26.615 --> 03:28.617
<i>I am an ambassador,
damn it!</i>

03:28.701 --> 03:31.495
I am supposed
to talk to people!

03:31.620 --> 03:33.914
You may yet
have the opportunity.

03:43.508 --> 03:47.720
What do you suppose the potentate
of this encampment calls himself?

03:47.803 --> 03:49.722
Oh, emperor,
at the very least.

03:49.805 --> 03:51.724
Hmm. Emperor.

04:11.453 --> 04:13.330
We seek your...

04:14.748 --> 04:18.878
We seek your headman,
your king.

04:21.505 --> 04:23.966
Try Greek.

04:33.059 --> 04:34.977
Eh?

04:56.543 --> 04:59.212
He says their king
is out there in that tent.

05:01.464 --> 05:03.925
He says the king
will not speak to us.

05:06.761 --> 05:10.640
Apparently, the king won't
speak to us because he's dead.

05:10.724 --> 05:13.143
<i>This is his funeral.</i>

05:20.234 --> 05:23.612
<i>You are being introduced to
one of the heirs apparent...</i>

05:23.738 --> 05:26.532
<i>Buliwyf.</i>

05:36.209 --> 05:38.670
"Buliwyf wishes
a song of glory."

05:38.754 --> 05:41.590
<i>Recite a poem, a tale.</i>

05:41.715 --> 05:43.966
<i>Surely you remember
something.</i>

05:45.760 --> 05:47.636
Uh...

05:50.264 --> 05:53.226
In the beginning,
the Earth was void,

05:53.352 --> 05:56.563
<i>and the spirits of God passed...</i>

06:12.120 --> 06:14.791
<i>Now that there was a new king,</i>

06:14.916 --> 06:17.960
<i>the Northmen prepared
for the funeral of their old king.</i>

06:24.550 --> 06:29.430
"We will burn him. In one moment,
he and all he owns can be in paradise.

06:31.516 --> 06:36.063
<i>These are our gifts to our lord
to support his kingdom in paradise.</i>

06:36.146 --> 06:39.942
To take with him?

06:40.025 --> 06:44.446
<i>Lo there do I see my father.</i>

06:46.532 --> 06:51.078
<i>'Lo there do I see my mother,
my sisters and my brothers.</i>

06:51.246 --> 06:54.582
<i>- 'Lo there do I see
the line of my people...</i>

06:54.666 --> 06:57.627
<i>back to the beginning.</i>

06:57.794 --> 07:00.547
'Lo they do call to me.

07:00.630 --> 07:03.925
<i>They bid me take my place among them
in the halls of Valhalla,</i>

07:04.009 --> 07:06.678
where the brave
may live forever.

07:06.803 --> 07:10.348
<i>"She will travel with him.</i>

07:10.473 --> 07:13.978
<i>You will not see this again.
It is the old way."</i>

08:14.457 --> 08:17.794
Another ship arrived
during the night.

08:17.877 --> 08:21.547
There's a boy standing out there
on the bow like he's a statue.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.394
The boy is letting them
see him.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.604
He's in plain sight!

08:35.729 --> 08:38.857
They do not know
if what they see is real.

08:38.982 --> 08:41.485
Something to do
with the mist.

08:41.610 --> 08:45.572
<i>Apparently, they find dangerous things,
spirits in the mist.</i>

08:45.698 --> 08:51.079
The boy was being polite, giving them
time to decide if he's real.

09:45.969 --> 09:47.429
<i>He's a messenger.</i>

09:47.554 --> 09:50.974
He comes from their homeland
in the north with a message for Buliwyf.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.314
<i>He is Wulfgar,</i>

09:57.439 --> 10:01.902
<i>son of King Hrothgar,
a great king from the north.</i>

10:01.985 --> 10:05.448
<i>He comes to ask Buliwyf
for help.</i>

10:05.573 --> 10:09.327
<i>His father's kingdom is under attack.
Their village is destroyed.</i>

10:09.452 --> 10:14.665
<i>They are menaced
by an ancient evil, a terror.</i>

10:14.791 --> 10:17.251
<i>A terror that has no name.</i>

10:17.377 --> 10:21.214
<i>A terror that must not
be named.</i>

10:26.512 --> 10:30.349
Look at them. What thing
would affect them so?

10:35.396 --> 10:38.023
<i>"The name cannot be said."</i>

10:43.237 --> 10:45.990
"He calls for
the Angel of Death.

11:03.259 --> 11:06.262
"He calls for the bones.
She's an oracle.

11:18.733 --> 11:21.193
She calls for men,
a number of them.

11:23.572 --> 11:27.034
Thirteen.
The number of months in the year.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.411
She says 13 men must go."

12:15.041 --> 12:16.959
Eight.

12:18.544 --> 12:21.006
<i>Nine.</i>

12:27.679 --> 12:30.099
Ten.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.315
<i>Eleven.</i>

13:18.566 --> 13:21.945
"She says the 13th man
must be no Northman."

13:29.285 --> 13:31.620
What the hell
are you saying?

13:31.746 --> 13:34.165
The 13th warrior is you.

13:55.145 --> 13:57.607
<i>He thinks
your horse is too small.</i>

14:00.485 --> 14:04.739
<i>Something about, "Only an Arab
would bring a dog to war."</i>

14:09.660 --> 14:11.704
"He wishes to know
your name."

14:13.081 --> 14:17.586
I am Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan,
Ibn Al Abbas, Ibn Rasid...

14:17.711 --> 14:19.797
<i>- "Eban."
- No, no.</i>

14:19.922 --> 14:24.635
Listen. Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan.
Ibn means "son of."

14:24.760 --> 14:26.220
Eban.

14:26.345 --> 14:28.806
Hyah! Hup!

14:34.978 --> 14:36.690
What is he saying?

14:36.815 --> 14:40.318
"Hurry to meet death
before your place is taken."

14:54.916 --> 14:59.213
I will not forget you.
Go with God.

14:59.296 --> 15:01.215
You listening?

16:20.881 --> 16:22.758
...tomorrow.

16:26.512 --> 16:30.891
<i>... sneak up to steal
ten or twelve horses.</i>

16:46.533 --> 16:49.411
<i>... we can find some geese.</i>

16:49.494 --> 16:53.040
<i>So then he says,
"Do not foretell me wife,</i>

16:53.165 --> 16:56.585
for I will get to know so-proven
aye komin home tonight."

16:56.669 --> 16:59.714
<i>I don't sound like that.</i>

17:01.006 --> 17:05.051
<i>Roneth slept with her
while we took the horses.</i>

17:05.176 --> 17:07.847
<i>Blowhards, both of you.</i>

17:07.930 --> 17:11.435
She probably was
some smoke-colored camp girl.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.436
Looked like
that one's mother.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.358
My mother...

17:22.403 --> 17:26.365
was a pure woman...

17:29.785 --> 17:34.207
<i>from a noble family.</i>

17:34.332 --> 17:36.293
<i>And I,</i>

17:36.418 --> 17:38.795
<i>at least,</i>

17:38.920 --> 17:41.465
know who my father is,

17:42.674 --> 17:44.801
<i>you...</i>

17:46.803 --> 17:49.639
pig-eating
son of a whore.

17:49.766 --> 17:51.684
<i>No, no, no, no, no!
Wait!</i>

17:51.809 --> 17:53.686
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Come.

17:53.811 --> 17:58.775
- Come on.
- Where did you learn our language?

18:00.651 --> 18:02.695
I listened!

18:29.349 --> 18:32.769
You can draw... sounds?

18:35.230 --> 18:37.232
"Draw sounds"?

18:39.484 --> 18:43.446
Yes, I can draw sounds,

18:45.240 --> 18:48.452
and I can speak them back.

18:48.536 --> 18:50.496
Show me.

19:00.756 --> 19:04.969
<i>There is only one God...</i>

19:06.554 --> 19:11.101
and Muhammad (peace be upon him) is His prophet.

19:20.901 --> 19:22.778
<i>Bring me those sacks.</i>

19:22.903 --> 19:25.072
- Hey!
- Mind yourself.

19:25.156 --> 19:27.784
Be quiet.

19:27.909 --> 19:31.371
Only an "Arob"...
would bring...

19:31.496 --> 19:34.082
A dog to war?

19:34.207 --> 19:36.084
I heard this
the first time.

19:56.272 --> 19:59.192
Good going, "Arabe."

20:24.385 --> 20:27.931
<i>Come on.</i>

20:36.940 --> 20:41.027
The dog can jump.

20:56.377 --> 20:58.295
Here.

20:59.463 --> 21:02.091
- No, no.
- Eat!

21:09.391 --> 21:11.977
Shouldn't we stay
closer to land?

21:12.060 --> 21:15.980
<i>No, boy! This is no day
to be close to land!</i>

21:29.619 --> 21:33.206
<i>Odin!</i>

21:44.552 --> 21:48.556
Odin!

21:55.730 --> 21:59.901
<i>Odin!</i>

22:01.027 --> 22:02.863
Down.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.663
- What did you... What is that...
- Be silent.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.919
Odin!

22:27.806 --> 22:29.849
Land!

22:40.528 --> 22:43.906
<i>"Arabe," speak what I draw.</i>

22:49.954 --> 22:53.082
There is only one God...

22:53.207 --> 22:56.127
and Muhammad (peace be upon him) is his...

23:01.800 --> 23:03.719
prophet.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.726
Go.

23:13.894 --> 23:15.813
Here.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.815
You'll need this.

23:20.193 --> 23:22.112
I cannot lift this.

23:22.195 --> 23:24.906
Grow stronger.

23:26.658 --> 23:28.577
Rider.

23:32.664 --> 23:34.666
Well-fed on a light mount.

23:37.836 --> 23:39.714
Perfume.

23:39.839 --> 23:41.799
A woman.

23:41.883 --> 23:43.801
A herald.

23:46.512 --> 23:49.348
It's a silk-swaddled
messenger boy.

23:49.432 --> 23:51.476
Tell me your names!
Quickly!

23:51.601 --> 23:55.438
I am Son to Hygiliak,
called Buliwyf.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.691
We all know
your worthy lord.

23:57.816 --> 23:59.777
We come on an errand
to serve him.

23:59.860 --> 24:02.780
My Lord Hrothgar will want
to welcome you himself.

24:52.790 --> 24:58.338
<i>No wall, no moat,
not even a presentable fence.</i>

24:58.422 --> 25:00.507
You couldn't keep a cow
out of this place.

25:11.892 --> 25:14.145
<i>Women and children.</i>

25:14.270 --> 25:17.441
Barely a man
between 15 and 50.

26:02.321 --> 26:06.575
<i>My lord, this is Buliwyf, son of
Hygiliak, come from across the sea.</i>

26:06.658 --> 26:09.828
<i>I know the man.
I sent for him.</i>

26:09.953 --> 26:13.708
<i>Knew him as a boy,
knew his father,</i>

26:13.833 --> 26:16.795
and I know him now.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.838
Grown to a man.

26:18.963 --> 26:23.176
<i>Grown to a fine,
fine man.</i>

26:32.477 --> 26:34.980
What troubles this place,
old man?

26:38.859 --> 26:41.320
You know
he might be mad.

26:44.156 --> 26:46.033
Be in the mist.

26:46.158 --> 26:49.328
<i>Has anyone seen one?</i>

26:49.412 --> 26:51.705
- Has anyone seen one in a hundred years?
- Hyah!

26:51.831 --> 26:55.961
They say they used to be
all over this countryside...

26:56.086 --> 26:58.213
and worse further north.

26:58.380 --> 27:00.715
People say many things.

27:00.799 --> 27:04.635
Whatever they are,
unless we can track them,

27:04.719 --> 27:06.637
we need a proper fence
and some sort of moat...

27:06.721 --> 27:09.724
<i>We could fashion a gate
from a wagon.</i>

27:09.807 --> 27:11.852
I don't want to build a fence.
I'm not a farmer.

27:11.977 --> 27:15.605
<i>- Let's go track the bastards...
- Gentlemen!</i>

27:46.345 --> 27:48.806
<i>- Boy! Speak to me, boy!
- Who did this?</i>

27:48.931 --> 27:51.810
<i>- Speak to me!
- Find someone who knows him. - Wait!</i>

27:54.104 --> 27:55.981
I know him.

28:02.446 --> 28:04.823
It's a farmstead,
just up the glen.

28:04.948 --> 28:06.825
I will take you.

29:19.943 --> 29:22.988
Don't step
in front of me.

30:51.581 --> 30:53.458
So it's true.

30:54.792 --> 30:57.586
<i>No horse tracks.</i>

30:57.670 --> 31:00.589
<i>- They were afoot.
- Their heads are missing.</i>

31:02.299 --> 31:05.595
<i>The child must have crawled
into a hole to escape.</i>

31:05.679 --> 31:09.433
They have been...

31:09.474 --> 31:11.351
gnawed upon.

31:12.477 --> 31:15.939
It is said
they eat the dead.

31:17.733 --> 31:22.279
Wh-What kind of a man...
could do that?

31:23.823 --> 31:25.908
It was not man.

31:26.033 --> 31:27.952
- It's the Wendol.
- Shh!

31:28.035 --> 31:30.163
They are here.

31:37.587 --> 31:39.505
What is it?

31:39.589 --> 31:42.425
The mother of the Wendol.

32:00.527 --> 32:04.199
- The trail?
- Dies in the rocks, two miles up.

32:04.324 --> 32:06.826
So they are clever.

32:06.951 --> 32:08.870
And cautious.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.164
<i>And there's more.</i>

32:15.460 --> 32:19.214
To the right.
The ridge near the watchtower.

32:25.846 --> 32:27.723
<i>And to the south.</i>

32:27.890 --> 32:30.935
The edge of the trees
near the first ridgeline.

32:34.230 --> 32:36.941
Something drove them out.

32:37.066 --> 32:39.110
Put your hand down,
little brother.

32:39.235 --> 32:41.238
<i>I believe they watch us.</i>

32:41.363 --> 32:43.323
<i>Even now.</i>

32:43.407 --> 32:45.700
If we chase?

32:45.784 --> 32:48.245
- They melt.
- Will they come to us?

32:48.328 --> 32:51.080
The farmers say
they come with the mist.

32:51.205 --> 32:54.083
So, if there's a fog,
they will come.

32:55.251 --> 33:00.424
We are hunted now
in our own land.

33:00.590 --> 33:03.218
<i>It wasn't always such.</i>

33:03.343 --> 33:06.596
<i>At first we thought to build,
to leave something,</i>

33:06.721 --> 33:09.099
<i>farms as far
as the eye could see.</i>

33:17.899 --> 33:20.903
What of the settlements
to the north and upcountry?

33:20.987 --> 33:23.781
<i>Estwyck was burned.</i>

33:23.906 --> 33:27.326
- Two years.
- Two years... ago.

33:28.453 --> 33:32.331
<i>And the others,
we had no word.</i>

33:32.457 --> 33:35.001
Not for some months.

33:35.126 --> 33:38.421
<i>At night,
with the drink upon them...</i>

33:39.506 --> 33:41.633
You do not drink tonight?

33:41.759 --> 33:44.219
No, we don't drink tonight.

33:59.319 --> 34:02.280
But let the dawn come,

34:02.363 --> 34:04.657
and they see the bodies.

34:06.868 --> 34:12.581
This gentleman has the look of a great
warrior. No doubt he's very brave.

34:12.665 --> 34:15.293
But to face the Wen...

34:15.418 --> 34:18.422
he'll need
some amazing luck.

34:18.505 --> 34:21.092
Luck often enough
will save a man,

34:21.175 --> 34:23.094
if his courage hold.

34:23.177 --> 34:25.096
<i>That's as may be.</i>

34:25.179 --> 34:28.014
- Who is that man?
- King's son.

34:28.139 --> 34:31.018
But wait for the Wendol
one night's time...

34:31.143 --> 34:33.437
and then talk to us
of courage.

34:33.521 --> 34:37.859
I thank the lord
for his advice,

34:37.943 --> 34:41.655
though I don't recall
hearing any exploits of his...

34:41.780 --> 34:43.989
apart from killing
his brothers.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.202
<i>You sit down
and be silent!</i>

34:48.284 --> 34:52.289
These are guests
at what is still my table!

35:08.473 --> 35:12.561
There is a man
who was at Estwyck.

35:12.727 --> 35:16.065
I saw the thing
that did this clear enough!

35:16.190 --> 35:19.694
Teeth like a lion,
head like a bear,

35:19.861 --> 35:23.114
claws that could tear
a plank to kindling.

35:23.239 --> 35:25.950
<i>They come in the night,
in the mist.</i>

35:26.075 --> 35:29.036
Always in the darkest, like they
could see in the black.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.081
Did they go on two legs
or four?

35:32.206 --> 35:36.420
It seems they did both, like a thing
that was both man and bear.

35:36.545 --> 35:39.882
<i>Though, myself,
I cannot tell.</i>

35:39.965 --> 35:42.509
I saw the glowworm, though.

35:42.593 --> 35:45.471
Saw it clear.
We all did on the last night.

35:45.596 --> 35:50.225
<i>Saw it come down out of the hills,
through the mist.</i>

35:50.392 --> 35:54.731
<i>Slithering this way and that.
Long as a hundred ships.</i>

35:54.814 --> 35:57.692
<i>Spitting fire at us
as it came.</i>

35:57.776 --> 36:00.320
My father's father
always warned of it.

36:00.445 --> 36:02.822
Said it was a hate
from old times.

36:02.947 --> 36:04.824
There will be fog.

36:08.787 --> 36:11.915
<i>Bring me my armour!</i>

36:13.458 --> 36:15.544
I will stand
the watch with you.

36:17.296 --> 36:20.800
My lord, the children
will need protection.

36:20.966 --> 36:24.136
Should they pass us,
then you and yours must stop them.

36:41.196 --> 36:43.114
Luck in battle, boy.

36:52.289 --> 36:55.460
<i>How can you sleep
at a time like this?</i>

36:55.585 --> 36:59.756
The Old Father wound the skeane
of your life a long time ago.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.759
Go and hide in a hole
if you wish.

37:02.843 --> 37:05.595
<i>But you won't live
one instant longer.</i>

37:05.679 --> 37:07.597
<i>Your fate is fixed.</i>

37:07.681 --> 37:10.517
Fear profits
man nothing.

38:15.086 --> 38:17.463
<i>When they come,</i>

38:17.588 --> 38:20.382
we form a circle
in the center of the room,

38:20.466 --> 38:23.052
backs to one another.

38:23.177 --> 38:25.096
I am not a warrior.

38:26.597 --> 38:29.601
Very soon you will be.

39:00.090 --> 39:01.967
<i>Ow!</i>

39:56.191 --> 39:58.109
Well, he didn't run!

40:01.321 --> 40:03.490
Hey.

40:05.366 --> 40:07.411
You appear
none the worse for wear.

40:07.536 --> 40:10.456
- Rognar is here.
- His head?

40:10.539 --> 40:12.875
No.

40:13.042 --> 40:16.629
They take the heads.
They always take the heads.

40:16.754 --> 40:18.672
<i>What about Hyglak?</i>

40:20.716 --> 40:22.635
It's the same.

40:22.718 --> 40:25.012
<i>- I see none of them.
- What?</i>

40:25.096 --> 40:27.432
None of them.

40:27.557 --> 40:29.768
None of the ones
we killed.

40:31.603 --> 40:34.106
Nor do I.

40:35.397 --> 40:37.274
Not one.

40:37.399 --> 40:41.112
I took two at least
that could not have lived.

40:41.237 --> 40:44.073
<i>As did I.
As did we all.</i>

40:44.156 --> 40:47.911
- Even the Arab gutted one.
- There was some life left in him.

40:48.036 --> 40:49.913
<i>They carried them off.
They must have.</i>

40:50.038 --> 40:52.541
They are demons.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.877
Their blood
looks real enough.

40:58.422 --> 41:02.551
- Ow!
- You complain much.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.220
Ow.

41:04.303 --> 41:07.265
<i>Help me carry Ragnar out.</i>

41:11.602 --> 41:15.273
<i>What is that?</i>

41:15.398 --> 41:18.276
Cow urine.

41:18.401 --> 41:20.278
"Cow urine"?

41:20.445 --> 41:22.405
- Boiled down.
- No.

41:22.488 --> 41:25.576
No, no, no. Don't put
that filth on me. No, no.

41:25.701 --> 41:28.745
Water.
Clean water.

41:30.706 --> 41:33.417
As you wish.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.754
Tomorrow the pus will run
and you'll have a fever.

41:43.178 --> 41:45.096
<i>Come, friend.</i>

41:47.432 --> 41:50.602
Your head has gone
looking for your hands.

41:50.685 --> 41:52.729
They will meet you
in paradise.

41:52.812 --> 41:57.275
<i>No bodies,
but here perhaps...</i>

41:57.358 --> 41:59.652
is one of their claws.

42:03.365 --> 42:05.284
<i>Let's go,
little brother.</i>

42:05.367 --> 42:07.495
We have the fences
to build.

42:11.457 --> 42:13.334
Keep 'em comin' down.

42:13.459 --> 42:16.712
Come in here.
Line up there.

42:16.837 --> 42:20.466
<i>Over here.
It'll be a long day.</i>

42:20.549 --> 42:22.052
You, in here.
You, over here.

42:34.688 --> 42:36.565
Move!

42:44.783 --> 42:47.994
Stand there.
I'll cut this pole.

42:48.078 --> 42:50.747
Keep your eye on the pole,
all right?

42:50.872 --> 42:52.749
So.

42:55.127 --> 42:57.254
Now you do it.

43:16.941 --> 43:18.860
Aah!

43:29.913 --> 43:32.458
Is there a metal worker?

43:32.583 --> 43:34.877
<i>A metal worker!</i>

43:56.191 --> 43:58.109
He insisted.

43:58.193 --> 44:01.238
Give an Arab a sword,
he makes a knife.

44:03.532 --> 44:05.451
It works.

44:11.791 --> 44:14.418
When you die, can I give that
to me daughter?

44:20.008 --> 44:22.427
Are you thirsty?

44:22.511 --> 44:26.515
- Mead?
- Water.

44:33.312 --> 44:35.189
Thank you.

44:38.151 --> 44:40.070
Aah!

44:40.195 --> 44:43.824
- Ow!
- That's a woman's sound.

44:43.990 --> 44:46.118
Do that again
and you'll make it.

44:46.243 --> 44:49.329
You'll heal.

44:50.455 --> 44:53.416
I think my nose
is ruined.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.627
- A small price.
- Ow!

45:02.343 --> 45:04.220
People are very quiet
today.

45:04.345 --> 45:08.182
- The peasants fear you will
bring the fireworm down on us. - What?

45:08.266 --> 45:11.436
The fireworm.
The fire-serpent.

45:12.562 --> 45:16.066
"The fire-serpent."

45:16.191 --> 45:18.110
A dragon?

45:19.194 --> 45:21.113
I do not believe
in dragons.

45:28.537 --> 45:31.206
Beware of Prince Wigliff.

45:31.331 --> 45:33.208
He poisons
the king's ear,

45:33.333 --> 45:35.920
says your Buliwyf has plans
to take his kingdom.

45:36.045 --> 45:39.090
Is there truth in this?

45:39.215 --> 45:41.509
No.

45:46.473 --> 45:48.349
You may believe me.

45:50.101 --> 45:52.687
Then be cautious.

46:00.070 --> 46:02.656
She would say no more.

46:02.740 --> 46:04.867
She doesn't need to.

46:04.992 --> 46:07.745
Prince, aah!

46:14.836 --> 46:16.755
<i>We'll need an example.</i>

46:19.424 --> 46:21.468
<i>The redhead?</i>

46:21.593 --> 46:23.220
Mm-hmm.

46:23.386 --> 46:26.222
I'll do it.

46:26.305 --> 46:28.724
You shouldn't be involved.

46:31.268 --> 46:35.357
- What should I do?
- Keep your teeth together and go back to work.

46:56.671 --> 46:59.090
Watch where you throw that.

47:06.889 --> 47:08.808
You dig like a dog.

47:11.477 --> 47:13.480
Did you call me a dog?

47:13.605 --> 47:17.484
I said you dig like one, flinging
earth carelessly like an animal.

47:17.609 --> 47:20.737
So, now
I'm an animal?

47:20.821 --> 47:22.656
You're not listening.

47:22.781 --> 47:24.700
I'm deaf?

47:24.825 --> 47:26.702
You're a fool,
little man.

47:26.827 --> 47:30.664
<i>That is because, boy,
your words are feeble...</i>

47:30.789 --> 47:33.168
and twisted
as an old woman's!

47:33.293 --> 47:36.087
This old woman'll send you
to the next world, old man!

47:40.842 --> 47:42.761
<i>What happened?</i>

47:42.844 --> 47:46.181
An engineering dispute.

47:53.272 --> 47:56.442
<i>- You notice he's bigger than you?
- Yes.</i>

47:56.525 --> 47:59.653
- And younger?
- Yes.

48:02.031 --> 48:05.576
- Bet on him, if you like.
- I may!

48:16.004 --> 48:18.799
Luck.

48:37.234 --> 48:39.152
Aah!

48:46.409 --> 48:48.286
You must stop it.

48:56.295 --> 49:00.091
- He's going to get killed.
- That is possible.

49:00.216 --> 49:02.426
But you can't...
you can't...

50:11.833 --> 50:14.002
You stupid fools!

50:38.401 --> 50:40.695
See to your friend.

50:42.280 --> 50:44.282
He was a brave man.

50:53.042 --> 50:56.003
- You... you could have killed him at will.
- Yes?

50:56.087 --> 50:59.674
- Wh-wh-why the deception?
- Deception is the point!

50:59.757 --> 51:02.343
Any fool
can calculate strength.

51:02.468 --> 51:05.347
That one has been doing it
from the moment he saw us.

51:05.430 --> 51:08.350
Now he has to calculate
what he can't see.

51:11.395 --> 51:15.941
And fear what
he doesn't know.

51:16.066 --> 51:19.903
As you say,
foolish and expensive.

51:20.028 --> 51:23.490
We'll miss Angus tonight.
We will miss his sword.

51:50.436 --> 51:52.354
Edgtho?

51:53.481 --> 51:55.357
Edgtho?

51:55.483 --> 51:59.320
Stifle your racket.
I hear you.

51:59.445 --> 52:02.616
- I thought to find you in the tower.
- Yeah.

52:02.741 --> 52:05.076
<i>- Why I'm not in it.
- Brought your food.</i>

52:28.183 --> 52:30.143
<i>- It's going to rain.
- Surf.</i>

52:30.268 --> 52:33.230
Three miles up
there's a cliff.

52:33.313 --> 52:36.608
Tide's right,
waves make thunder.

52:36.691 --> 52:39.402
<i>Farmers call it
the "thunder cliffs."</i>

52:44.909 --> 52:47.370
<i>The mist is forming.</i>

52:47.495 --> 52:49.372
<i>I see it.</i>

53:10.018 --> 53:13.063
<i>The worm.
They've roused the fireworm.</i>

53:37.630 --> 53:39.884
Quickly!

53:40.009 --> 53:42.678
No time to waste.
Outside! Go!

53:42.761 --> 53:44.680
Quickly! Move!

53:51.187 --> 53:53.564
Come on!

54:04.618 --> 54:06.870
<i>Go get the water.</i>

54:10.956 --> 54:13.459
A serpent of fire.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.503
<i>Breathing fire.</i>

54:15.586 --> 54:17.797
What's that in the field
below the tower?

54:21.468 --> 54:24.763
- It's a child.
- Look at her.

54:31.269 --> 54:33.188
Open the gate.
Get the gate!

54:33.271 --> 54:35.899
- Open the gate!
- Push!

54:35.982 --> 54:38.945
No! You need to raise
the spikes first! Help me!

54:39.028 --> 54:41.739
- Come on!
- Down.

55:22.031 --> 55:24.075
Push it now!

55:24.159 --> 55:26.119
Heave!

55:30.039 --> 55:32.834
So you saw
the fireworm?

55:32.959 --> 55:35.587
It's cavalry.

55:35.671 --> 55:38.424
- I rather prefer a dragon.
- Hundreds.

55:38.507 --> 55:41.093
<i>With torches.</i>

55:42.219 --> 55:44.138
Take the north.

55:44.221 --> 55:47.141
Let's go, little brother.
It's beginning.

55:49.852 --> 55:51.770
"Arabe"! Here!

56:07.912 --> 56:09.747
Guard!

56:37.902 --> 56:41.823
Allah,
be merciful.

57:52.814 --> 57:54.941
<i>Ja! Did you see that?
Hold this.</i>

57:55.025 --> 57:57.861
I got you!
Ja!

58:20.300 --> 58:23.553
Yeah!

59:00.759 --> 59:03.053
It's a man.

59:05.889 --> 59:08.517
It's a man.

59:08.685 --> 59:12.272
It's a man.
It's a man.

59:12.397 --> 59:15.441
It's a man!
It's a man!

59:17.902 --> 59:20.446
It's all right,
little brother.

59:20.572 --> 59:24.450
There are more.

59:24.576 --> 59:26.744
Aah!

59:28.330 --> 59:30.249
Aah!

59:30.374 --> 59:33.252
- Aah!
- Aah!

59:33.377 --> 59:35.254
Aah!

59:35.379 --> 59:38.090
Aah!

59:44.263 --> 59:46.974
Get 'em over!

59:53.899 --> 59:55.775
Aah!

59:57.318 --> 01:00:00.029
They've breeched the gate!

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:07.746
Aah!

01:00:30.645 --> 01:00:32.480
Aah!

01:00:32.605 --> 01:00:34.565
They've breeched the gate!

01:00:34.649 --> 01:00:38.027
Fight them!
Turn and fight them!

01:00:40.571 --> 01:00:42.490
Aah!

01:00:44.325 --> 01:00:46.829
Come on!
Come on!

01:00:48.121 --> 01:00:49.998
Ahmed!

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.168
What do I do with it?

01:00:53.252 --> 01:00:56.964
Put your foot on it
and stand!

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.985
Aah!

01:01:20.738 --> 01:01:23.449
Aah!

01:01:49.769 --> 01:01:52.355
Aah!

01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:06.077
Aah!

01:02:07.204 --> 01:02:10.540
Don't!

01:02:27.099 --> 01:02:29.685
Aah!

01:03:11.813 --> 01:03:15.066
Skeld, Halga, Roneth...

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:19.112
and Rethel will be
joining them.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:33.002
I cannot...

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:36.797
taste neither
the fermentation of grape...

01:03:38.507 --> 01:03:40.886
nor of wheat.

01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:44.681
What?

01:03:44.806 --> 01:03:47.017
Why do you
laugh?

01:03:50.853 --> 01:03:53.939
Honey.

01:03:54.023 --> 01:03:56.775
It's made from honey.

01:04:29.727 --> 01:04:31.979
We will die here.

01:04:34.524 --> 01:04:36.400
It is...

01:04:38.737 --> 01:04:40.656
possible.

01:04:59.801 --> 01:05:02.387
Come.

01:05:12.438 --> 01:05:14.315
Come on.

01:05:17.361 --> 01:05:20.281
She finish you,
or bring you back to life?

01:05:20.364 --> 01:05:23.033
A gentleman doesn't
discuss such things.

01:05:26.954 --> 01:05:29.373
<i>Three more on the fence.</i>

01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:41.011
Looks like the mating
of a man and some beast.

01:05:41.136 --> 01:05:43.430
It's a man.

01:05:45.015 --> 01:05:47.349
<i>If it's a man,
it must sleep.</i>

01:05:47.475 --> 01:05:50.603
If it sleeps, it has a lair
and we have a trail.

01:05:50.769 --> 01:05:53.147
Attack them?

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:55.567
Is there a choice?

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.865
Come with me.
There is a woman who can help.

01:06:07.787 --> 01:06:09.623
Bring the Arab.

01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:12.626
<i>There's one down here
who was old...</i>

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:14.962
<i>when my grandmother
was a girl.</i>

01:06:15.046 --> 01:06:16.964
She's quite mad.

01:06:17.048 --> 01:06:19.467
The perfect advisor.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.307
Oh, Weilew.
Oh.

01:06:26.474 --> 01:06:28.935
Shame, shame, shame.

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:33.231
It's a Queen Weilew fronts
me now, does she not?

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:35.567
We seek your counsel,
Madam.

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.653
We or he?

01:06:37.778 --> 01:06:40.322
Step closer, Buliwyf.

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:44.284
<i>Closer.</i>

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:46.286
You know me?

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:50.207
I have ears.
"Warrior," says the wind.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:54.003
<i>"Chieftain,"
says the rain.</i>

01:06:54.087 --> 01:06:56.840
But why seek you me?

01:06:56.965 --> 01:06:59.509
Met you your match?

01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:02.554
Met you your match...

01:07:02.637 --> 01:07:05.473
<i>with the eaters of the dead?</i>

01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.477
We seek your wisdom.

01:07:11.146 --> 01:07:13.941
Wars are won in the will.

01:07:14.066 --> 01:07:17.069
Perhaps you've been fighting
in the wrong field.

01:07:17.194 --> 01:07:21.031
<i>Have you a token?
A thing.</i>

01:07:21.115 --> 01:07:24.702
- A thing of them.
- Yes.

01:07:34.254 --> 01:07:36.506
Ahh.

01:07:38.216 --> 01:07:42.219
They show you the way
you will not see.

01:07:42.303 --> 01:07:45.473
Slaughter them
till you rot.

01:07:45.598 --> 01:07:47.725
<i>You'll accomplish nothing.</i>

01:07:49.268 --> 01:07:51.520
Find the root.

01:07:51.605 --> 01:07:53.690
<i>- Strike the will.
- How?</i>

01:07:53.773 --> 01:07:56.359
This is the mother
of the Wen.

01:07:56.443 --> 01:07:59.529
She they revere.

01:07:59.613 --> 01:08:01.573
She is the will.

01:08:01.698 --> 01:08:04.242
Where do I seek her?

01:08:04.367 --> 01:08:08.371
She is the earth.
Seek her in the earth.

01:08:15.254 --> 01:08:19.341
<i>And Buliwyf, beware
the leader of their warriors.</i>

01:08:19.466 --> 01:08:21.469
He wears
the horns of power.

01:08:23.679 --> 01:08:27.350
He, too, you must kill.

01:08:29.602 --> 01:08:32.481
Have we anything
resembling a plan?

01:08:32.564 --> 01:08:35.442
<i>Uh-huh. Ride till
we find them, kill them all.</i>

01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:30.167
A child could
follow this.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.754
They have no fear,
no fear of us at all.

01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:58.195
The dog
does not approve.

01:09:58.278 --> 01:10:00.363
<i>Bear skulls.</i>

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:03.033
I don't think
they like company.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:08.206
The claws.

01:10:08.331 --> 01:10:11.125
The headdresses.

01:10:11.250 --> 01:10:13.127
Bears.

01:10:13.252 --> 01:10:16.589
They think they are bears.

01:10:16.714 --> 01:10:19.175
They want us
to think they are bears.

01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:22.136
Hey, how do you
hunt a bear?

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:24.555
Chase it down with dogs.
What...

01:10:24.639 --> 01:10:27.434
How do you hunt a bear
in winter?

01:10:27.559 --> 01:10:30.020
Go in his cave
with spears.

01:10:30.103 --> 01:10:32.940
Where is a cave?

01:10:33.023 --> 01:10:35.692
It's in the earth.

01:10:39.112 --> 01:10:41.240
The next glen,
many fires.

01:10:41.323 --> 01:10:43.158
Is there a cave?

01:11:00.802 --> 01:11:02.720
But there's
no cave.

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:07.726
Yes, there is.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.441
<i>- Straight into the rock face.
- Can we get to it?</i>

01:11:14.525 --> 01:11:17.069
If they don't
keep dogs, maybe.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:30.562
You'd have to
kiss me first, dearie.

01:12:30.687 --> 01:12:32.564
Let's go.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.085
Oh, how deep in
the Earth are we?

01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.922
- Deep enough to fall out the bottom.
- Come on!

01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:05.912
Look at your feet.

01:14:16.881 --> 01:14:18.799
I was wrong.

01:14:19.885 --> 01:14:23.472
These are not men.

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:52.001
<i>If we cut our way
through them,</i>

01:14:52.085 --> 01:14:54.379
we will have
the other lot on us.

01:14:54.462 --> 01:14:56.381
Down the wall,

01:14:56.506 --> 01:14:59.176
<i>and we swim.</i>

01:15:11.605 --> 01:15:13.566
I go.

01:16:06.871 --> 01:16:10.333
- Let's go, little brother.
- I do not enjoy heights.

01:16:44.327 --> 01:16:46.246
Stay.

01:18:26.975 --> 01:18:28.894
Aah!

01:18:35.026 --> 01:18:37.237
Go!
Kill her!

01:18:39.239 --> 01:18:41.115
Do it!

01:20:04.285 --> 01:20:06.787
Aah!

01:20:30.104 --> 01:20:31.856
Aah!

01:20:38.655 --> 01:20:40.573
Damn it!

01:20:47.414 --> 01:20:50.376
It is done?

01:20:50.543 --> 01:20:52.419
It is.

01:20:57.258 --> 01:21:00.719
A hard fight to get
clear of here?

01:21:03.097 --> 01:21:06.810
<i>Hey, there's
a passage leading down.</i>

01:21:36.673 --> 01:21:41.052
I've run about
as far as I care to.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:47.101
Today was a good day.

01:21:47.185 --> 01:21:49.937
A good day.

01:21:52.315 --> 01:21:54.192
Get along, lad.

01:21:57.153 --> 01:21:59.071
Go.

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.506
Helfdane?

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:24.015
We'll just keep
following this stream.

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.976
It has to come out
somewhere.

01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.859
Stream disappears
under the rocks.

01:22:43.953 --> 01:22:46.497
- Buliwyf!
- I'm all right.

01:22:48.374 --> 01:22:51.418
We fight by twos.
Give the other pair a chance to rest.

01:22:54.463 --> 01:22:56.715
Here they come.

01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.717
Go on,
make it worse.

01:22:58.843 --> 01:23:01.053
Now it's gonna rain.

01:23:01.178 --> 01:23:04.850
<i>It's gonna rain. It's gonna rain.</i>

01:23:06.351 --> 01:23:09.521
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

01:23:09.646 --> 01:23:12.106
- Thunder.
- Waves make thunder.

01:23:12.231 --> 01:23:15.818
- The thunder cliffs.
- Surf. Surf.

01:23:16.902 --> 01:23:20.197
There's a surf
out there.

01:23:20.281 --> 01:23:24.578
<i>Can we swim it?
Do we drown trying?</i>

01:23:26.121 --> 01:23:28.039
Try it.

01:23:31.710 --> 01:23:35.213
Breathe! Breathe!
Deep breath!

01:23:35.338 --> 01:23:38.341
Now, one, two, three!

01:23:40.218 --> 01:23:43.097
The way we'll know is...

01:23:43.181 --> 01:23:46.100
if they don't follow us,

01:23:46.184 --> 01:23:48.895
it's too far to swim!

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.638
<i>Not through the night.</i>

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:04.474
<i>- His fate is sealed.
- You don't know that.</i>

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:07.227
The skeane is tied.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.437
The weave
was settled long ago.

01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:15.067
You're wearing that
long face for me?

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.531
I cannot help it.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:27.831
I have only
these hands.

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:29.833
I will die
a pauper.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:37.925
You will be buried
as a king.

01:25:43.848 --> 01:25:46.851
A man might
be thought wealthy...

01:25:46.934 --> 01:25:51.147
<i>if someone
were to draw...</i>

01:25:51.272 --> 01:25:53.524
<i>the story
of his deeds...</i>

01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:57.905
that they may be remembered.

01:26:04.912 --> 01:26:08.373
Such a man might be
thought wealthy indeed.

01:26:13.921 --> 01:26:16.299
He's traveling
to the other side.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:22.180
He grips his sword
as if afraid he will not wake.

01:26:24.098 --> 01:26:27.519
<i>Think no more of these things.
You must rest now.</i>

01:26:28.686 --> 01:26:31.105
<i>- I'm not tired.
- Rest.</i>

01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:33.983
The Wendol want vengeance
for killing their mother.

01:26:34.108 --> 01:26:36.570
<i>They will
come soon.</i>

01:26:36.654 --> 01:26:38.572
Again?

01:26:38.656 --> 01:26:41.075
We killed the mother
but not the leader.

01:26:41.158 --> 01:26:44.078
As long as he lives,
they will come back to fight us.

01:26:44.161 --> 01:26:46.080
When?

01:26:47.581 --> 01:26:48.958
Tonight.

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:59.427
The evening
lasts so long here.

01:26:59.553 --> 01:27:01.513
<i>Not like home.</i>

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.599
I don't think tonight
there will be...

01:27:05.724 --> 01:27:09.436
<i>fog.</i>

01:27:48.978 --> 01:27:51.189
"Kill the mother,"
she said.

01:27:51.314 --> 01:27:53.400
"Kill their leader
and they will break."

01:27:53.525 --> 01:27:56.278
We'll soon find out
if she was right.

01:27:58.030 --> 01:28:00.824
At least we don't
have to worry about fire.

01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:12.337
They're all terrified,
ready to break and run.

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.714
I wish we had
Buliwyf with us.

01:28:14.839 --> 01:28:16.716
It's a small matter.

01:28:30.563 --> 01:28:32.983
Here.

01:28:34.318 --> 01:28:36.737
Prepare yourselves.

01:29:12.107 --> 01:29:14.734
Merciful Father,

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.779
I have squandered my days
with plans of many things.

01:29:20.782 --> 01:29:24.536
This was not among them.

01:29:24.619 --> 01:29:27.205
But at this moment,

01:29:27.289 --> 01:29:30.001
I beg only...

01:29:30.126 --> 01:29:33.588
to live the next
few minutes well.

01:29:35.339 --> 01:29:38.926
<i>When the time comes.</i>

01:29:40.511 --> 01:29:42.805
Don't let them
be taken.

01:29:50.522 --> 01:29:53.734
For all we ought
to have thought...

01:29:53.817 --> 01:29:56.320
and have not thought,

01:29:56.403 --> 01:29:59.364
all we ought to have said...

01:29:59.489 --> 01:30:02.701
and have not said,

01:30:02.826 --> 01:30:05.871
all we ought to have done...

01:30:05.996 --> 01:30:08.291
and have not done,

01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:15.006
I pray Thee, God,
for forgiveness.

01:30:20.678 --> 01:30:22.597
<i>They're coming!</i>

01:31:31.502 --> 01:31:35.673
'Lo there
do I see my father.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:40.177
<i>- 'Lo there do I see my mother and my sisters...
- Mother and my sisters...</i>

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:41.888
<i>- and my brothers.
- And my brothers.</i>

01:31:50.772 --> 01:31:53.358
'Lo there do I see
the line of my people,

01:31:53.442 --> 01:31:55.986
back to the beginning.

01:31:58.947 --> 01:32:02.409
'Lo they do call to me.

01:32:02.492 --> 01:32:04.913
They bid me
take my place among them.

01:32:09.584 --> 01:32:12.295
In the halls of Valhalla,

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:14.797
where the brave...

01:32:14.923 --> 01:32:17.300
may live...

01:32:17.425 --> 01:32:19.886
forever.

01:32:21.095 --> 01:32:24.016
Aah!

01:33:37.967 --> 01:33:40.929
Aah!

01:33:47.686 --> 01:33:50.439
Aah!

01:33:55.736 --> 01:33:58.739
Aah!

01:35:40.095 --> 01:35:42.014
<i>It's over.</i>

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:43.286
We shall make prayers
for your safe passage.

01:36:43.411 --> 01:36:45.412
Prayers to who?

01:36:45.538 --> 01:36:49.208
<i>In your land one god is perhaps enough,
but we have need of many.</i>

01:36:49.333 --> 01:36:53.546
I will pray to all of them for you.
Do not be offended.

01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:56.424
I'll be in your debt.

01:37:00.554 --> 01:37:02.472
Good-bye, Arab!

01:37:04.933 --> 01:37:07.686
Good-bye, Northman.

01:37:18.489 --> 01:37:22.451
<i>Across seas of
monsters and forests of demons we traveled.</i>

01:37:22.535 --> 01:37:24.704
<i>Praise be to Allah,</i>

01:37:24.787 --> 01:37:27.832
<i>the merciful
and compassionate.</i>

01:37:27.957 --> 01:37:30.918
<i>May His blessing
be upon pagan men...</i>

01:37:31.085 --> 01:37:33.922
<i>who loved other gods,
who shared their food...</i>

01:37:34.006 --> 01:37:36.383
<i>and shed their blood...</i>

01:37:36.466 --> 01:37:40.596
<i>that his servant,
Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan,</i>

01:37:40.721 --> 01:37:42.806
<i>might become a man...</i>

01:37:42.931 --> 01:37:46.268
<i>and a useful servant of God.</i>
