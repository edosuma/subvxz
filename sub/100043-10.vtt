00:01.627 --> 00:05.881
So, all this childhood memorabilia
came to me after your mother died.

00:05.881 --> 00:08.842
Diaries, photo albums, adorable drawings.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.886
So, enjoy your stroll down memory lane,

00:10.886 --> 00:14.097
but know that at the end
of that lane is a dumpster.

00:14.431 --> 00:17.518
Okay, you have a painting upstairs
by William "The Refrigerator" Perry,

00:17.518 --> 00:19.394
but there's no room for my baby teeth.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.147
I needed to free up some space
in the garage.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.982
Because it's not a garage anymore.

00:24.066 --> 00:27.152
It's a warehouse full of dog beds
that nobody wants to buy.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.447
It's been a slow period,
but it should pick up next quarter.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.326
What? When all the dogs
get back their income tax refund

00:34.326 --> 00:37.246
and they want to go
splurge on beds for themselves?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.413
Joe.
What?

00:38.497 --> 00:40.791
Help me drag some of these
things out to my car.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.335
We're gonna do some
old-fashioned marketing today.

00:43.335 --> 00:45.921
- Oh, my God, the old Atari!
- Uh-huh.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.339
Remember why we got that?

00:47.339 --> 00:49.633
Yeah. So, we were on our first
family vacation ever, okay?

00:49.633 --> 00:50.926
- Ever.
- A week at this water park resort,

00:50.926 --> 00:52.010
- and Dad...
- Mmm-hmm.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.220
...got bored after, what,

00:53.220 --> 00:54.388
- three days?
- Three.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.932
Made us leave early
and he bought us off with this.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.433
Lies and untruths.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.979
We stayed the full week and I got
you two ingrates that game anyway.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.273
How long are you
gonna stick to that story?

01:04.273 --> 01:08.026
Much as you two enjoy portraying me
as some kind of abusive parent...

01:08.110 --> 01:09.570
Oh!

01:09.570 --> 01:11.363
Relax, Joe. We'll get you out in a second.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.408
Okay, 35 years and you...
You still can't admit it.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.536
There's nothing to admit.
I see light. Should I go towards it?

01:17.536 --> 01:20.497
Why would we both remember it one way
if it didn't happen, Dad?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.374
- Kids like to make things up.
- Mmm!

01:22.374 --> 01:24.418
They like the drama. Come here, kid.

01:25.002 --> 01:28.463
I was literally about to gnaw
my own arm off to get free!

01:28.547 --> 01:31.300
With those things? I still have the tooth
you lost in a marshmallow.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.759
Okay, so that one you kept.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.067
<i>I was in Florida visiting my dad.</i>

01:49.151 --> 01:51.111
I'd gotten a call that
he was wandering around

01:51.195 --> 01:52.905
the grocery store he used to run.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.490
I wanted to find out if he was okay,

01:55.949 --> 01:58.160
but that's not something you can just ask.

01:59.244 --> 02:03.040
You know, your mother and I came here
every Sunday for 44 years.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.626
- You miss her, don't you?
- It comes and goes.

02:06.585 --> 02:08.545
- Fourth of July is rough.
- Really?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.339
I didn't realize she was so patriotic.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.217
Well, it's that hotdog eating contest
they have on TV.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.301
You know, I always thought

02:14.301 --> 02:17.471
that your mother could have
been a competitive eater.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.681
No food ever expired in our house.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.893
She'd see that last date
pop up on a pound of bacon

02:22.893 --> 02:25.145
a gallon of milk, and down it went.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.688
It was personal for her.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.776
Speaking of food, do you ever head over
to your old grocery store?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.945
Hey, listen! Do you remember that?

02:33.779 --> 02:37.074
- Oh, yeah. Penguinsquatch.
- Put this town on the map.

02:37.783 --> 02:41.745
June, 1977. Teen revelers
report massive bird footprints

02:41.745 --> 02:43.330
emerging from Lake Okeechobee.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.581
A crowd gathers,

02:44.665 --> 02:47.292
but the new tide has covered
the so-called bird prints,

02:47.376 --> 02:48.919
and the teens are beaten soundly.

02:48.919 --> 02:53.006
Tracks reappear several days later
and once again, word spreads through town.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.385
An ornithologist deems the prints
those of a gigantic penguin,

02:56.385 --> 02:58.095
some 15 feet in height.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.721
People come from miles around

02:59.805 --> 03:02.099
to catch a glimpse
of the wonderous waddler.

03:02.099 --> 03:05.686
The tracks will appear on and off
for years, and then disappear forever,

03:06.353 --> 03:09.523
but not before Olympic gold medalist
Mary Lou Retton makes the trek

03:09.523 --> 03:13.735
to place her tiny footprints inside
those of the be-flippered colossus.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.363
Didn't we take a picnic
over there a few nights?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.656
Everyone did.

03:17.656 --> 03:21.243
It's the first time I ever saw
your mother eat a bag of apples.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.538
So, Dad. I, uh...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.331
I wanted to ask you...

03:26.415 --> 03:28.500
Oh, boy. No serious talk, okay?

03:28.834 --> 03:31.336
Yes, I'm talking all my million pills.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.380
You can come over and press my stomach.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.133
I'm starting to feel like a beanbag chair.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.553
Guys, I just saw a ghost.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.513
Okay, girls,
grab your things, we're going.

03:41.597 --> 03:42.764
Not a real ghost.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.934
More like a vision from my past.
Brenda Feldman.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.188
An older girl that Manny had a crush on.

03:49.188 --> 03:52.900
He even wrote a poem for her
when he was little.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.735
I gave her my heart,

03:54.943 --> 03:57.571
she gave me a picture of me
as an old-time sheriff.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.325
Today was my second chance,

04:01.325 --> 04:03.368
but I couldn't even get up
the nerve to say "hi."

04:03.452 --> 04:05.913
11-year-old Manny
would be disgusted by me.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.956
Well, now you know
how 12-year-old Lily feels.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.709
Oh, sorry, this is work.

04:10.709 --> 04:11.793
Hello?

04:11.877 --> 04:14.838
Manny, do you know who this
family's resident expert is

04:14.922 --> 04:16.381
in interpersonal problems?

04:16.465 --> 04:17.758
I would say no one's a specialist.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.384
That's right. It's me.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.262
It took a little while,
but I finally convinced Manny

04:22.346 --> 04:24.723
the reason he had failed last time
with Brenda Feldman

04:24.723 --> 04:26.767
was because of his grand gesture.

04:27.518 --> 04:29.561
Today called for a completely
different approach,

04:30.479 --> 04:31.730
a super-grand gesture.

04:32.397 --> 04:36.151
Just go to her. Get in there!
Let's go! Come on! Hyah!

04:37.361 --> 04:41.907
Well, looks like my first house sale
is going to fall through.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.785
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. You know what,
things will turn around.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.203
Do not turn around.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.288
That's Debra Knox.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.666
She stole my Educator of the Year Award.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.001
- A swooper?
- Swooper! Lily, grab your things.

04:53.085 --> 04:57.005
Oh, no, no, no! Not a smoke demon
that terrorizes farm children.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.510
It's a person that takes things
that are supposed to be yours.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.303
I have one of my own.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.932
<i>I was closing the deal
of my very first showing.</i>

05:06.932 --> 05:09.643
<i>And a rival agent swooped in.</i>

05:09.643 --> 05:12.646
What a lovely home. I mean, maybe
not great for kids, you know?

05:12.646 --> 05:14.481
Wait, what? But we're pregnant.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.234
Oh! Oh, my goodness! I'm sorry,
I didn't even see you there. I was...

05:17.234 --> 05:19.987
Oh, my!
Is that a California vulture wasp?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.155
A mountain lion
must have made a fresh kill.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.994
So, the couple agreed
to go to her open house later.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.996
<i>Hey there, Sue,
I heard you got dumped</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:30.873
<i>And now you are blue</i>

05:30.873 --> 05:32.624
<i>So, how about we go to the prom</i>

05:32.708 --> 05:34.668
<i>If it's okay with my mom?</i>

05:34.668 --> 05:38.463
I'm so glad that Manny stopped doing those
embarrassing things.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.300
Oh, come on. Who doesn't
love a grand gesture?

05:42.718 --> 05:44.845
In front of my friends, Ronald?

05:44.845 --> 05:47.306
I can't believe
I ever let you do my homework.

05:47.973 --> 05:51.393
Oh, my gosh. Oh, no, no, no,
Manny. Manny, abort, abort, abort, abort!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.645
Back up, back up. Back, back, back...

05:53.729 --> 05:55.355
Get going.
- I'm going.

05:55.439 --> 05:56.607
Abort!

05:56.982 --> 05:58.901
Last week I left some dog beds here.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.361
So, now the owners are probably
getting swamped with requests.

06:01.445 --> 06:05.032
The other day I found out that Joe
saved up six months of allowance

06:05.032 --> 06:06.909
and donated it all to charity.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.536
It's one of those rare moments as a dad

06:09.620 --> 06:11.872
when you realize
you've really dropped the ball.

06:12.289 --> 06:15.167
I mean, the kid needed to learn
the basics of business.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.543
Ooh!

06:16.627 --> 06:19.505
Can I get that dog?
I'll do 50 hours of chores.

06:19.505 --> 06:20.839
- No, 100.
- Whoa.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.424
Sales lesson number one,

06:22.508 --> 06:25.594
never look desperate
in a negotiation. No emotion.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.262
Think of your cousin Lily.

06:27.346 --> 06:29.389
Hey, I noticed the dog beds moved.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.016
They must be pretty popular, huh?

06:31.016 --> 06:32.100
Um...

06:32.184 --> 06:33.852
The dogs didn't like them.
What?

06:33.936 --> 06:35.187
These are dogs nobody wants.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.522
I mean, what do they have going on?

06:36.522 --> 06:38.482
Don't worry. The cats love them.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.108
Cats? Never! I'm taking them home.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.528
I mean, cat in a pineapple?
How does that even make sense?

06:42.528 --> 06:45.447
Maybe they are from Meow-i?

06:45.531 --> 06:47.449
Get it? 'Cause Hawaii?

06:47.533 --> 06:48.700
- Get in the car.
- Okay.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.706
This Atari has quite a dent in it.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.875
- Didn't you throw it at me?
- No.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.169
Then explain this groove in my head,

06:59.253 --> 07:01.213
'cause, yeah, I could fit them
together like a puzzle.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.673
Mitchell, you fell down
the stairs sleepwalking.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.757
Mmm.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.634
- It's established family history.
- Oh...

07:05.634 --> 07:07.386
Unwilling to admit a mistake.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.388
Wonder where you picked that up from.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.765
Look, it drives me nuts too that Dad
never copped to his mistakes.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.100
It's always gonna be our word against his.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.226
Hmm.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.436
Why did you cut the necks
out of all these sweatshirts?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.188
Oh, I was a big <i>Flashdance</i> fan.

07:18.522 --> 07:22.067
How you survived the golden age
of bullying, I will never understand.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.151
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.862
We're sitting on
a treasure trove of evidence

07:24.862 --> 07:27.906
that could prove Dad cut
our vacation short, okay?

07:28.365 --> 07:29.449
I mean, you realize that

07:29.533 --> 07:32.494
building cases against society's
worst criminals is what I do.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.162
How's that case against the deaf old lady

07:34.246 --> 07:36.790
who sells bacon-wrapped hot dogs
outside Laker games going?

07:36.874 --> 07:38.709
She was warned three times.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.920
Okay, how do we prove that Dad
made us come home early?

07:42.004 --> 07:44.631
I mean, what was that place
we went even called?

07:44.715 --> 07:47.301
Hold on, I just saw
a matchbook from there.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.760
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here it is, here it is.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.597
"Handelman Waterpark.
Celebrating 25 years."

07:51.597 --> 07:54.224
Ooh! I can get on this <i>CSI</i> train.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.854
Okay, "founded in 1958."
So, that puts us there in '83.

07:58.854 --> 08:03.150
- '83, '83... Locating my diary from '83.
- Okay.

08:03.150 --> 08:07.446
And okay. Here it is.
"April 20th. I think JT likes me.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.031
"Makes fun of my head dent."

08:09.031 --> 08:10.282
All right, so it had to have
been before that...

08:10.282 --> 08:11.450
Yes.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.620
...because we didn't have the video
game yet. And that's what made the...

08:14.620 --> 08:16.038
I interrupted.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.082
So, we were there early April and...

08:19.166 --> 08:21.043
No diary entries for then. Okay.

08:21.043 --> 08:24.213
So, okay. But maybe this might help.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.964
Look at this.
Aw!

08:26.048 --> 08:28.800
- Here. Here it is. "Day One at Handelman."
- Whoa.

08:28.884 --> 08:29.885
Okay, here we go.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.097
A Mariachi band?

08:34.181 --> 08:37.518
If you want that Brenda girl,
talk to her like you don't care.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.686
And then don't call her for a week.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.897
Or what? Present himself
as some brooding mystery man

08:41.897 --> 08:44.775
whose dad-like approval
she has to work for?

08:44.775 --> 08:47.319
What woman has ever found that attractive?

08:47.778 --> 08:48.820
I'll try it.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.448
Oh, great. There's Debra again.

08:51.532 --> 08:54.785
Probably down there flaunting her
$30 gift card she got with my award.

08:54.785 --> 08:56.411
- It's my award.
- So, go time?

08:56.745 --> 08:58.872
Yeah, you know what? Maybe I will.
I'll just march right up to her

08:58.956 --> 09:00.832
and give her the
classic Tucker stare down.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.585
A dirty look. That's your big plan?

09:03.669 --> 09:06.296
Yeah, she'll see in my eyes
that I know exactly what she did.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.342
And trust me, all the free sample
of perfume spritzes in this mall

09:10.342 --> 09:13.095
won't be able to cover up
the stench of guilt on her.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.430
Well, I just made
a nice little connection.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.224
Not with Brenda, who barely noticed me,

09:17.224 --> 09:19.226
but with Ronald,
who invited me to Panda Express

09:19.226 --> 09:20.602
so we could eat our feelings.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.896
Manny... Um...

09:22.980 --> 09:24.940
You took off before
I could give you my number.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.776
And maybe I could get yours, too?

09:28.110 --> 09:29.236
- Sure.
- Yeah?

09:30.404 --> 09:32.990
Do you need my advice
with your problem now?

09:32.990 --> 09:34.074
Whatever.

09:36.243 --> 09:40.080
So, you should point this thing west
and, uh, come meet your great-grandbabies.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.498
Ah, this spring, I think.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.169
I wanna pose them to recreate
famous photos from history.

09:45.169 --> 09:49.173
I've got all the outfits
to recreate the V-J Day kiss.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.549
But I still need the fedora

09:50.549 --> 09:52.718
to pull off Jack Ruby
and Lee Harvey Oswald.

09:52.718 --> 09:55.012
- Careful.
- Well, obviously the gun won't be loaded.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.555
No, no, no, it's a pothole.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.931
- Oh!
- Oh, jeez.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.641
I bet we blew a tire.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.810
Fortunately, one local inventor

10:01.894 --> 10:04.521
has been hard at work
on the Presto-Jack TM,

10:04.605 --> 10:08.358
a pneumatic device that both
lifts a car and powers a drill

10:08.442 --> 10:10.444
that change lug nuts. I don't suppose...

10:10.444 --> 10:12.237
Yep, in the trunk.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.948
Yes, we can finally test it out.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.201
Ready to launch?
- Let's do it.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.580
Steady as she goes.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.749
And she's up!

10:24.041 --> 10:25.792
It's working! You did it!

10:26.168 --> 10:28.420
It's... Why is this still going?

10:28.504 --> 10:29.713
How hard did you press "start"?

10:29.713 --> 10:32.549
- That shouldn't matter!
- Well, just press "end task."

10:32.633 --> 10:34.593
- Okay.
- But only on the right side of the button.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.095
Why wouldn't you tell me that first?

10:37.429 --> 10:38.847
Sweet maker!

10:41.308 --> 10:42.434
Hmm.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.436
Everybody warned me this would happen.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.317
Hello, Debra.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.443
Oh.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.362
- Hi, Cam.
- You wish.

10:53.362 --> 10:57.282
I know you'll deny it, but these eyes
can see right through you.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.575
You mean, how I stole

10:58.659 --> 11:00.494
the Educator of the Year Award?

11:00.953 --> 11:03.455
I got you to admit it.
It's a good thing I'm wearing a wire.

11:03.539 --> 11:05.249
- Let me see it.
- Damn it.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.627
I'm gonna be the belle
of the ball in this dress.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.587
Stealing this award
has given me the confidence

11:10.671 --> 11:12.881
to crush everyone in my path.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.426
<i>Permiso.</i>

11:19.179 --> 11:21.056
I never even saw Gloria
going into the dressing room.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.766
But there she was, like a superhero,

11:22.850 --> 11:25.519
able to destroy confidence
in a single pose.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.647
I'm glad I didn't go with the first dress.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.025
They'll take one look at this one
and make me principal.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.277
Ai-yi-yi.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.736
Oh, come on!

11:34.820 --> 11:37.489
You know what? Maybe you should try
the dress on that lady's wearing.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.244
Oh, my God, that was brilliant
and humbling.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.788
You know,
I pride myself on solving people problems.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.707
You know what, you still have
the swooper. Maybe I could...

11:46.707 --> 11:47.875
No, thanks.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.712
She just can't accept help, but I can.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.839
I'm thinking about rocking this
for my date with Brenda.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.300
Ignore the buttons.
Can you tell this is a woman's coat?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.467
Yes.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.387
Sales lesson number two, create demand.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.640
Leave a few dog beds lying around.
Dogs fall in love,

12:03.724 --> 12:05.559
your phones start ringing off the hook.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.020
Go ahead. Go.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.731
Wow. My dog really likes this bed.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.901
I wonder if leaving it here
will create demand.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.027
Uh, no, thank you.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.655
All right, good start. You could have been
a little cuter with that.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.699
- What?
- When did you start saying "really likes"?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.034
What happened to "weawwy wikes"?

12:22.034 --> 12:24.745
You paid a speech therapist
to shame it out of me.

12:26.205 --> 12:28.498
Still no cell service. Let's...

12:28.582 --> 12:30.042
Let's just hitchhike to the barber...

12:30.042 --> 12:31.793
...and call the tow company from there.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.962
You can't let anything go!

12:34.046 --> 12:36.548
You slept with my sister
while I was pregnant.

12:36.632 --> 12:37.758
Not the hot one.

12:37.758 --> 12:40.010
I swear to God. I swear to God,
we are going through with this wedding

12:40.010 --> 12:42.304
so that I can kill you and then
I'm gonna divorce your corpse.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.306
Well, you seem like a nice couple.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.016
Room for two more in there?

12:46.308 --> 12:50.312
My dad's positive attitude versus
a couple bound for a <i>Dateline</i> episode?

12:51.772 --> 12:53.232
It wasn't even a fair fight.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.693
<i>Sweet Caroline</i>

13:01.240 --> 13:04.868
All right, final lesson,
always be willing to walk away.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.164
Hey, Ron. I come to you first
because we're old friends.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.666
- It's Lon.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.168
There's a steep price on this one,
but don't blame me.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.754
I'm pocketing less than the kids that,
you know, made this thing.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.756
The Beagle Has Landed.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.424
Sorry, Jay, none of these are selling.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.884
Even the ones that look like hot cakes?

13:23.053 --> 13:24.805
Maybe a puppy will cheer you up.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.557
I told you, not gonna happen.

13:26.557 --> 13:27.808
You're giving up?

13:27.808 --> 13:29.601
I can't give these things away.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.311
Forget everything I taught you today.

13:31.395 --> 13:33.272
I don't know what I'm talking about.

13:34.398 --> 13:38.569
Hey, Mister. My dad was about
to give you the deal of a lifetime,

13:38.569 --> 13:41.154
100 dog beds for 100 bucks.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.365
So you can give one away
with each new dog.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.867
100 bucks, huh?

13:45.117 --> 13:46.743
I can see you're not serious.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.789
Slow down that tail, buddy.
This is leaving with me.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.625
Wait, wait, don't walk away.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.961
Would you do 50 bucks?

13:55.961 --> 13:57.796
Will you throw in a puppy?

13:59.173 --> 14:01.341
I've had two late-in-life projects.

14:01.425 --> 14:04.428
One, dog beds was a bust. The other...

14:06.013 --> 14:07.723
...is looking pretty promising.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.310
All right. Okay,
so Handelman closed in '99,

14:11.310 --> 14:13.437
so no guest registry
to tell us when we checked out.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.316
Rental car companies are a dead end,
and no credit card receipts.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.776
God! Mitchell, it might be time
for us to face some facts.

14:19.860 --> 14:23.405
What, that some people very high up
don't want us to know the truth?

14:23.405 --> 14:26.408
No. That we might have
to let Dad skate on this one.

14:26.408 --> 14:27.534
Never!

14:28.160 --> 14:30.746
Go easy on those bubblegum cigarettes,
Mitchell. They're gonna kill you.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.706
Look, we tried, right?

14:34.708 --> 14:38.795
I bought a pack of these the last night
we were at that resort

14:38.879 --> 14:42.799
so I could try to look cool
at some concert that we went to.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.676
Hang on. Where was it? I...

14:44.760 --> 14:45.844
Oh-ho...

14:45.928 --> 14:48.555
- Bingo! What do you see, huh?
- Um...

14:48.639 --> 14:52.392
Me at the park in a hat with the name
"Maddox" embroidered on it.

14:52.476 --> 14:54.561
Oh, I forgot about
my Maddox Pritchett phase.

14:54.645 --> 14:57.773
God, it is a miracle that you didn't need
a police escort to school every day.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.775
Not you, the marquee.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.860
"Tonight and Wednesday Only: The Monkees!"

15:01.944 --> 15:05.989
Yes! And according to their website,
they played the 14th and the 16th.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.699
So, if we went the first night,

15:07.783 --> 15:10.410
that means we would have left the 15th

15:10.494 --> 15:12.955
and we would have left early.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.415
Okay, wait just a second. I...
I remember I was so upset

15:15.499 --> 15:16.959
- that our vacation was being cut short...
- Yes.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.170
...that I cheered myself up by going
to the premiere of <i>Flashdance,</i>

15:20.254 --> 15:23.048
which was on... Ha! April 15th.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.259
Yeah! What is up with you and that movie?

15:25.259 --> 15:26.760
She was so much more than a welder,

15:26.844 --> 15:30.430
and I was so much more than the president
of Students Against TV on Weeknights.

15:30.514 --> 15:33.642
Okay, I know you remember it this way,
but how are we gonna prove it?

15:33.642 --> 15:34.768
Bam!

15:35.060 --> 15:37.229
My ticket, clearly marked "Opening Night."

15:37.229 --> 15:39.273
- I'm gonna say bam again. Bam!
- Ha!

15:39.273 --> 15:40.357
I can't believe it!

15:40.357 --> 15:42.901
We might actually see Dad
admit that he was wrong.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.445
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:45.529 --> 15:47.030
Do you think he'll cry?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.490
No. Claire, don't do that.

15:48.574 --> 15:49.908
Just take the victory.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.619
But I mean, why... Why was
he in such a rush to get home?

15:52.703 --> 15:56.123
You know,
to meet his buds at O'Brien's Pub?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.583
I don't know. It's just...

15:57.583 --> 15:59.126
Well, it is a little weird, though.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.878
It says, "To Jay Pritchett,

16:00.878 --> 16:04.548
"the greatest bartender in the universe.
Dean Martin, May 1st, 1983."

16:04.548 --> 16:06.341
Since when is Dad a bartender?

16:06.925 --> 16:08.719
Well, this is right after our trip.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.180
I'm calling work wife.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.849
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Margaret. Really quick.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.934
Was Dad ever a bartender?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.269
<i>Gosh! Who knows?</i>

16:17.269 --> 16:21.148
<i>I wouldn't trust this memory of mine
anyway. And...</i>

16:21.148 --> 16:22.691
<i>This is a bad...</i>

16:22.691 --> 16:24.359
Margaret, that's what a bad connection... <i>- You know...</i>

16:24.443 --> 16:25.485
stopped sounding like...

16:25.569 --> 16:27.404
...when phones stopped having antennas.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.781
<i>Fine! Early days
of the business,</i>

16:29.865 --> 16:31.283
<i>we couldn't make payroll.</i>

16:31.283 --> 16:35.120
<i>He had to come back from a trip
to pay everyone out of his own pocket.</i>

16:35.204 --> 16:37.539
<i>Took the night job to make ends meet.</i>

16:37.623 --> 16:39.291
Why wouldn't he have told us?

16:39.291 --> 16:41.293
<i>Probably didn't
wanna worry anyone.</i>

16:41.293 --> 16:44.671
<i>Anyway, back to the wall,
he did some of his best work.</i>

16:44.755 --> 16:46.882
<i>Came up with a best-selling closet.</i>

16:46.882 --> 16:49.218
"Introducing The Maddox."

16:52.721 --> 16:55.307
And around this corner
is the entertainer's kitchen...

16:55.724 --> 16:56.725
What are you doing here?

16:56.725 --> 17:00.979
Oh, I just came
through the unsecure back door.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.523
- Hello again.
- Hi.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.483
We're still interested in your house.

17:04.483 --> 17:06.568
We just might be leaning towards this one.

17:06.652 --> 17:08.487
Oh, oh, I'm very surprised.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.114
People that like cooking so much,

17:11.198 --> 17:15.369
are you guys going to be happy
with this tiny little pantry?

17:15.369 --> 17:17.704
That leads to a gigantic pantry.

17:17.788 --> 17:18.914
Are you ready to see
the interactive nursery?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.416
The baby just kicked.
Aw!

17:21.500 --> 17:22.960
Hey! We...

17:22.960 --> 17:25.170
Are you all about to be my new neighbor?

17:25.754 --> 17:27.714
Hope you like to party. My name's Fred.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.343
They call me Peeper, because...
Well, that doesn't matter.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.928
Look at the chocolate chip cookies!

17:32.928 --> 17:35.722
Kids, get in here.
Get yourself some supper.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.769
These are my blessings.
Do I like ethnic women? Guilty.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.230
Oh, my God.
Do you like farm-fresh eggs?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.774
I sold my very first house

17:45.858 --> 17:47.943
and destroyed my swooper.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.320
Of course, the only way
you can destroy a real swooper

17:50.404 --> 17:52.781
is to stab its reflection
during the harvest moon.

17:52.865 --> 17:54.950
Enjoy Poland, you two.

17:54.950 --> 17:57.452
Hey, Frank.
Afraid I was about to close up.

17:57.536 --> 17:58.537
Betsy's birthday.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.581
- Okay, we'll come back, Don.
- Well. Hey, hang on.

18:00.581 --> 18:03.500
I'm... I'm pretty nifty with the shears.
I used to... I used to cut Luke's hair,

18:03.584 --> 18:07.462
and I once trimmed a hedge in our yard
into the spitting image of Doug Henning.

18:07.796 --> 18:08.797
Sold!

18:08.881 --> 18:10.799
- Just lock her up.
- Thank you very much.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.468
Hop on up there, young man.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.639
If I'm not mistaken, you saw
your first naked lady in this barbershop.

18:17.723 --> 18:18.849
You know it.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.934
Hell of a crossing guard,

18:21.018 --> 18:23.353
but when she went crazy,
she didn't go halfway.

18:23.437 --> 18:24.897
Well, that was her training.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.858
So, Dad, um...

18:29.776 --> 18:31.695
Just gonna get this over with. Um...

18:31.695 --> 18:34.907
Oh, boy, is this gonna be about me
going back to the grocery store?

18:34.907 --> 18:37.117
Well, it... It just seemed a little weird.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.077
I heard you were there for hours.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.915
The place was a mess.
I mean, where is the pride?

18:42.915 --> 18:45.542
Old days, they used to deliver
my oranges on Tuesdays.

18:45.626 --> 18:48.128
I could not have built the pyramid faster

18:48.212 --> 18:51.381
- with 10,000 Hebrews.
- So, you weren't just wandering.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.176
It's just... I miss it, is all.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.513
This takes me to my next question. Um...

18:58.889 --> 19:00.557
Did you and Mom ever...

19:00.641 --> 19:03.060
Ever want another child?

19:03.060 --> 19:05.812
Why, I suppose all parents wonder
how things would have changed

19:05.896 --> 19:07.606
- if they had a different child.
- I didn't...

19:07.606 --> 19:10.692
I didn't mean a different
one. I mean, an additional one.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.319
Why do you ask?

19:12.736 --> 19:15.197
Well, 'cause, if you'd had
another kid, maybe...

19:15.197 --> 19:17.282
Maybe he'd have taken over
the business, and...

19:17.366 --> 19:19.034
And you wouldn't have to sell. I always...

19:19.493 --> 19:21.411
I always felt kind of bad that I didn't.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.123
The answer is no, Phil. Never.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.209
Because...

19:27.876 --> 19:30.003
Well, you did take over
the family business, didn't you?

19:30.546 --> 19:33.799
Keeping life light.
Making it fun for everybody.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.512
I learned from the best.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.515
<i>When I was growing up,
he was the cool dad.</i>

19:41.515 --> 19:42.641
<i>He was hip.</i>

19:42.641 --> 19:44.643
He knew all the dances from <i>Grease.</i>

19:44.643 --> 19:48.105
He knew all the expressions.
BFF, Best Friends Forever.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.648
TMI, Too Much Information.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.191
BJ, Blue Jeans.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.484
It makes me feel lucky.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.362
We didn't do much that day,

19:56.363 --> 19:57.364
but it might have
been one of the...

19:57.364 --> 19:59.575
The best days I ever had with my dad.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.036
I just didn't know it would be the last.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.455
My dad was okay.

20:05.998 --> 20:09.418
And my takeaway from our day,

20:10.419 --> 20:13.881
don't miss a chance
to let the people you appreciate

20:14.756 --> 20:15.757
know that.

20:17.301 --> 20:21.763
The hard part has been figuring out a way
to pay tribute to my dad,

20:21.847 --> 20:24.141
but something came to me
in the garage today.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.815
<i>I think he would have liked it.</i>

20:44.203 --> 20:46.538
<i>He left some big footprints, my old man.</i>

20:50.083 --> 20:52.169
Look, they're getting along great.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.171
That's not our worry. Your mother is.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.424
Eight years she ignored Stella.
Gave her a complex.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.301
One time I was clicking a pen,

20:59.676 --> 21:00.761
Stella threw up 'cause she thought

21:00.761 --> 21:02.012
high heels were coming.

21:02.513 --> 21:05.224
<i>Hola.</i>

21:05.224 --> 21:06.934
What is this?

21:07.059 --> 21:08.310
He's the grown-up.

21:08.727 --> 21:10.270
Honey, we know how you feel...

21:10.354 --> 21:13.982
It's the cutest thing
I've seen in my whole life.

21:14.358 --> 21:15.817
I love you!

21:15.901 --> 21:19.196
Oh, my God. I need a selfie
with my best little boy.

21:19.196 --> 21:20.697
I'll be back.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.199
It's not your fault.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.453
It is not your fault.
