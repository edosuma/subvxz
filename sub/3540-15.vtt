Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.336
For over a century,
I've lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.573 --> 00:10.134
- I know the risk. I have to know her.
- She's a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.642
- Why do I look like her?
- You were adopted.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.975
This girl showed up,
16 and about to give birth.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.810
- What else do you know?
- Just her name. Isobel.

00:18.985 --> 00:22.512
My wife, Isobel, spent her life
researching paranormal activity.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.519
- Where's your wife?
- Damon killed her.

00:24.724 --> 00:28.626
There's a tomb under the church.
A spell sealed Katherine in that tomb.

00:28.795 --> 00:30.160
I'm gonna bring her back.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.025
She's not here!

00:32.232 --> 00:35.759
- You knew Katherine wasn't there.
- She knew where you were, didn't care.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.616
Jeez.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.378
You scared me.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.348
Do you know what day it is?

00:59.526 --> 01:01.323
Saturday.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.192
And what year?

01:05.565 --> 01:06.691
It's 2010.

01:08.668 --> 01:10.659
- You okay?
- Thank you.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.394
Wait. What's your name?

01:13.673 --> 01:17.404
- It's Harper, sir.
- How did you get out here?

01:19.179 --> 01:21.340
Why are you dressed like that?

01:24.851 --> 01:27.479
You seem like a very nice person.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.848
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.610
Hey, Bonnie, it's me.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.880
Just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.823
We miss you here.
Don't let your aunt drive you too crazy.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.457
Come home soon. Love you.

02:11.631 --> 02:15.931
- What are you doing out here? It's cold.
- Thinking, writing.

02:16.102 --> 02:18.229
The, uh, funeral for Bonnie's grandma...

02:18.438 --> 02:21.134
...it brought back a lot
about mom and dad.

02:21.341 --> 02:24.970
I was wondering, you said that
you would do some digging about them.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.042
The adoption?

02:27.847 --> 02:31.214
- Right.
- So did you? Dig?

02:33.386 --> 02:35.115
Come on inside.

02:35.288 --> 02:37.756
Your dad kept everything
from his medical practice.

02:37.924 --> 02:41.257
Records, logs, old appointment books.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.759
I found an entry
from the night you were born.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.658
Patient and a birthdate.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.992
- Isobel Peterson.
- Think that's her real name?

02:48.168 --> 02:51.228
Pregnant teenage runaway? Probably not.
First name maybe.

02:51.437 --> 02:54.463
But where'd she get Peterson?
A classmate? Best friend?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.336
So I Binged it.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.139
I searched for all the Petersons
in this area born the same year as Isobel.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.973
Found three, two men...

03:03.917 --> 03:07.785
...and a woman, Trudie,
who lived in Grove Hill, Virginia.

03:07.987 --> 03:11.514
- That's not far from here.
- Well, watch this.

03:17.997 --> 03:19.931
Isobel.

03:21.301 --> 03:24.293
- She was a cheerleader.
- Ha-ha-ha.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.036
Trudie still lives there.

03:27.707 --> 03:30.904
- This is her address.
- What about Isobel?

03:32.478 --> 03:36.175
I couldn't find anything about her.

03:43.189 --> 03:46.181
Listen, there's something else.
Mr. Saltzman, Rick?

03:46.426 --> 03:48.656
His wife was from around here.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.659
And her name was also Isobel.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.690
Wait.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.226
"Was" as in?

03:58.638 --> 04:00.162
She died.

04:02.675 --> 04:06.873
Alaric's wife
might have been your mother?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.407
It can't be true, right?

04:08.581 --> 04:12.176
I mean, the coincidence alone
is just crazy.

04:14.554 --> 04:18.353
- I have the address for her friend Trudie.
- You wanna talk to her.

04:19.759 --> 04:20.952
I don't know. I...

04:22.028 --> 04:23.859
Ha, l...

04:24.030 --> 04:25.759
I don't know.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.661
If it's true,
and they are the same person...

04:28.868 --> 04:32.668
...that means that my birth mother
is dead.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.706
And I don't know
if I could handle that.

04:37.343 --> 04:40.608
Elena, did Jenna tell you anything
about Alaric's wife?

04:41.381 --> 04:43.076
How she died?

04:43.283 --> 04:46.411
Just that she was killed
and the case was never solved.

04:48.855 --> 04:49.981
You knew that already?

04:54.093 --> 04:56.357
The night at the school
when he attacked me...

04:56.562 --> 04:59.395
...he told me some things
about her death.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.500
- Well...
- No, no, no. It's not possible.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.727
The coincidences. It's too much.

05:05.872 --> 05:09.774
Listen, if you do decide to go talk
to Isobel's friend, I'll go with you.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.601
Yeah?

05:11.778 --> 05:14.372
I just don't know
what I'm gonna do yet.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.519
I should get going.
I gotta go deal with Damon.

05:25.558 --> 05:30.860
- How's he doing?
- He's dealing, in his own way.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.009
- How do I taste?
- Ahh.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.114
So much better than your friends.
But, shh, don't tell them.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.550
- They might get jealous.
- Ha, ha.

05:53.252 --> 05:55.482
No. Buzzkill Bob.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.056
Greetings.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.192
Can we talk?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.024
- Yeah.
- Without the Tri-Delts?

06:05.198 --> 06:08.599
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of them.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.362
They're really good at keeping secrets.

06:13.339 --> 06:16.035
You're worried about me. That's nice.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.939
Don't be. There's no need, I'm fine.
Why wouldn't I be?

06:19.145 --> 06:22.512
I spent the last 145 years

06:22.682 --> 06:25.173
Get in that tomb. I succeeded.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.616
Granted, Katherine wasn't in there
to be rescued, but why dwell?

06:28.821 --> 06:31.722
You know, it's so liberating
not having a master plan...

06:31.891 --> 06:34.086
...because I can do
whatever the hell I want.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.960
- That's kind of what I'm afraid of.
- Relax.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.793
I haven't killed anyone in,
phew, too long.

06:44.003 --> 06:47.370
- Those girls?
- Will end up in their dorm.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.304
With headaches.
Think they blacked out.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.535
Business as usual.

06:52.745 --> 06:56.112
Predictably, you didn't pull me over here
for a pep talk.

06:56.315 --> 06:59.216
So drink up. Spill it, brother.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.981
There was a woman
you may have known a few years back...

07:04.157 --> 07:06.489
...named Isobel,
in North Carolina at Duke.

07:06.692 --> 07:09.388
You wanna discuss the women
in my past right now?

07:09.562 --> 07:10.893
- Seriously?
- You killed her.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.860
What's your point?

07:13.032 --> 07:16.490
I just wanna know
if you remember anything about her.

07:16.669 --> 07:21.072
- It's like a needle in a haystack, Stefan.
- Well, think hard. It's important.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.005
Nothing is important. Not anymore.

07:27.413 --> 07:28.880
Great chat.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.744
I have to go and exploit some women
in the name of grief.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.910
Which I'm sure you understand.

07:35.154 --> 07:38.055
TTFN, said the Tri-Delt.

07:40.693 --> 07:42.627
Another big game for Fernando.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.287
Taylor is not gonna be able
to take him down.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.629
- What?
- This is boring. I'm bored.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.360
Wow, ha.

07:51.804 --> 07:56.366
But we have this entire house
to ourselves.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.874
I mean, it's practically a bachelor pad.

07:59.712 --> 08:00.736
And?

08:01.180 --> 08:07.881
So shouldn't we do something
a little bit more bachelor pad-y?

08:08.087 --> 08:11.215
What? Something like this?

08:14.594 --> 08:17.188
Something like that.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.624
I don't know.
This is a pretty good show.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.924
Seriously?

08:39.919 --> 08:42.820
Oh, God. Not on my couch.

08:43.722 --> 08:44.747
Mom.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.285
Hey.

08:49.495 --> 08:53.522
I don't know, it's just weird, you know,
me being raffled off like a Disney cruise.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.463
In this town,
fundraising is like indentured servitude.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.297
You don't have a choice.

08:58.471 --> 09:02.100
And besides, you're a bachelor
and you're eligible, so there you go.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.674
Here, let me help you with this.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.235
There we go.

09:18.357 --> 09:20.882
Oh, God,
I can't believe I'm gonna do this.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.496
- What?
- I'm totally gonna ruin this moment.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.790
But I have to tell you.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.024
Elena recently found out
she was adopted...

09:29.201 --> 09:32.534
...and she's been looking
for her birth mother...

09:32.705 --> 09:33.865
...whose name is Isobel.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.769
Isobel? Like my wife?

09:37.009 --> 09:38.340
No, Isobel never had a baby.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.002
Are you sure?
Not before you were together?

09:41.213 --> 09:43.044
Nope. No way.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.857
This is Elena's birth mother.

09:59.699 --> 10:01.496
Uh, she, uh...

10:03.402 --> 10:05.370
She never told me.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.666
I, uh...

10:08.207 --> 10:10.107
I'm gonna go.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.807
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

10:38.604 --> 10:41.402
Trudie? Tru...? Trudie Peterson?

10:41.607 --> 10:43.768
- Yes?
- Uh, my name is Elena Gilbert.

10:43.976 --> 10:47.639
I wanted to talk to you
about Isobel Flemming.

10:48.247 --> 10:51.045
Well, I haven't heard that name
in years.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.274
How do you know her?

10:53.886 --> 10:57.083
I think that, um, well...

10:58.290 --> 11:01.418
Do you know if she had a baby
that she gave up for adoption?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.598
Oh, my God.

11:07.633 --> 11:08.793
You're her daughter.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.799
I was just gonna make some tea.
Would you like some?

11:17.176 --> 11:20.942
- Sure.
- Uh, the kitchen's this way.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.150
I wasn't gonna come.
I didn't think I was.

11:34.393 --> 11:37.157
But I was driving,
and I hit this stoplight...

11:37.396 --> 11:41.526
...and it made me think about
when I was learning how to drive...

11:41.767 --> 11:45.430
...and my mom would always warn me
about this blind turn on the left side...

11:45.604 --> 11:47.970
...and then I was thinking
about my mom and...

11:49.341 --> 11:51.502
I had your address.
I'm sorry for barging in.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.542
It's no problem.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.546
Um, just a surprise, though.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.516
- I haven't thought about Isobel in years.
- When was the last time you saw her?

12:00.686 --> 12:04.816
About 17 years ago,
when she left to go have you.

12:05.024 --> 12:09.859
We kept in touch for a while,
but, well, you know, people drift apart.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.859
And you don't know
where she ended up?

12:12.031 --> 12:13.623
She was in Florida for a while.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.359
She was on her own.
I know it wasn't easy.

12:18.571 --> 12:22.029
Do you have any idea
who my father is?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.371
I could never get her to fess up.

12:28.881 --> 12:34.319
Anyway, she finally pulled it together,
got into college on a scholarship.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.212
- Where did she go?
- Somewhere in North Carolina.

12:38.390 --> 12:40.551
Duke, I think.

12:40.726 --> 12:41.920
Smart girl, smart school.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.325
Let me just grab that, ahem.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.006
So it's been a few months.
Where you been?

13:00.179 --> 13:02.909
Oh, you know, here and there.
Never one place too long.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.106
You know Pete.

13:04.283 --> 13:08.549
No, actually, I don't, because
you've never brought him around.

13:09.688 --> 13:12.782
So blond's the new flavor
of the month, huh?

13:13.025 --> 13:15.186
So sorry I scared her off.

13:15.361 --> 13:18.797
- She's not a flavor, Mom. I like her.
- So she's the one?

13:18.998 --> 13:22.365
No, probably not. But maybe.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.930
Matty, seriously,
Lezzie Forbes' daughter? Ugh.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.504
Mom, seriously, knock it off.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.543
Ice, please.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.611
So have, uh, you heard from Vick?

13:41.787 --> 13:43.584
No, but don't worry.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.554
She'll come home eventually,
when she needs something.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.057
- I've played that game.
- Are you playing it now?

13:49.228 --> 13:51.128
- No.
- Then what are you doing home?

13:51.297 --> 13:54.130
You trying to say I need a reason
to come back?

13:57.303 --> 13:58.930
Sit down. Eat with me.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.765
Tell me everything I've missed. Hm?

14:09.315 --> 14:10.407
Thanks for meeting me.

14:10.616 --> 14:12.777
- Something's come up.
- Jenna told you.

14:12.985 --> 14:14.680
- Yeah.
- So it's true.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.947
Your wife, Isobel,
was Elena's birth mother.

14:17.122 --> 14:19.113
What does Elena know?

14:20.359 --> 14:22.020
- About your wife?
- About everything.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.458
- About you, your brother.
- She knows what I am.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.098
And she knows
that you know about the vampires.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.863
- She know about Damon and Isobel?
- No.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.129
I couldn't tell her, not until I was sure.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.871
- You said you'd help me.
- I asked Damon. He doesn't remember.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.006
- Ask him again.
- Damon is not stable right now.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.671
He murdered my wife,
or at least made a meal of her.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.716
- When has he been stable?
- I'm telling you not to push this.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.582
- Give me a reason not to.
- Your survival. How's that?

14:49.788 --> 14:52.313
I'll handle it,
but for now, I need you to let it go.

14:53.859 --> 14:56.521
Is that what you'll tell Elena?
Let it go?

15:01.700 --> 15:04.191
Leave Elena out of this.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.601
I need to know what happened.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.104
I'd think you would too.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.410
I need more
than just your wife's name.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.140
A picture,
something I could show Damon.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.333
- Is...?
- Just a few more minutes.

15:36.535 --> 15:39.561
Can't you, uh... Can't you finish this
in the morning?

15:40.272 --> 15:44.868
- But I like working at night.
- See, I like sleeping at night. With you.

15:48.547 --> 15:52.381
Okay, I'll bite. What is it?
Thesis stuff?

15:55.120 --> 15:58.521
Uh... Look, I'm in a three-way here
with you and your computer.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.524
The least you can do
is let me know what you're up to.

16:10.869 --> 16:13.429
I was doing research,
and I dug up all this stuff...

16:13.605 --> 16:16.597
...about this small town in Virginia
near where I grew up.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.903
It's isolated, out of the way,
and quiet.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.740
And every now and then,
people die mysteriously.

16:22.948 --> 16:27.317
And they say that it's animal attacks,
except these bodies are drained of blood.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.390
- It's vampires. It has to be.
- Okay.

16:34.626 --> 16:36.651
I'll get my garlic and holy water.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.956
- And maybe, just maybe...
- No.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.962
- Ugh.
...we can get some sleep.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.261
- Oh, no.
- Come here. Look, this is why I love you.

16:44.470 --> 16:48.065
Because you believe
in all of this stuff...

16:48.507 --> 16:50.998
...so much so
that you're making a degree out of it.

16:51.210 --> 16:55.738
You're like Mulder,
except hotter and a girl.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.479
This is not a joke, Rick.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.080
You think that this is cute...

17:03.255 --> 17:05.415
...but I'm gonna prove it.

17:12.263 --> 17:13.992
And Mulder was right in the end.

17:16.734 --> 17:21.001
Ah. They came to the games for us.
The football team hadn't won in years.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.470
We were the stars.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.871
Well, lzzie was.
But I was a damn good backup.

17:26.310 --> 17:29.803
- This is great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:30.449 --> 17:32.940
- You haven't touched your tea.
- Oh.

17:33.118 --> 17:34.176
Yeah.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.051
- What is this?
- Oh, it's just some herbal mixture.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.959
Vervain?

17:49.468 --> 17:51.959
- You know.
- Know what?

17:52.771 --> 17:56.298
You didn't invite me in,
and you're serving vervain tea.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.999
You know.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.575
- I think that you should probably leave.
- Wait.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.045
- What are you not telling me?
- Please leave.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.818
Now.

18:45.357 --> 18:46.915
Bourbon.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.961
Behold the teacher.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.690
Don't you have some papers to grade?

18:57.536 --> 19:00.027
It's, uh, more fun with a buzz.

19:00.205 --> 19:03.868
Well, most things in life are.
Sober's depressing.

19:04.076 --> 19:08.206
- You don't strike me as depressed.
- You say that like you know me.

19:08.380 --> 19:09.779
Nope.

19:11.550 --> 19:12.949
It's just a hunch.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.259
- You have a good afternoon.
- Not likely.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.997
- Daytime drinking, huh?
- It's all the rage.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.899
Listen, I need a favor.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.766
- You ever been in love?
- Excuse me?

19:34.940 --> 19:37.909
Have you ever been so bent
on someone...

19:38.076 --> 19:40.237
...just to have your heart ripped out
by them?

19:40.412 --> 19:42.607
You forget I was married.

19:42.781 --> 19:44.373
Right. Gay husband.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.943
She'll have what I'm having.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.253
Sit down.

19:52.925 --> 19:57.658
Look, there's a fundraiser here tonight
that the Founder's Council is throwing.

19:57.896 --> 20:02.265
The town's most eligible bachelors
get raffled off for dates.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.965
And, well, we're short a bachelor.

20:05.170 --> 20:09.334
Is this what you do
when there's no, um, vampires?

20:09.541 --> 20:11.202
Organize bachelor raffles?

20:11.410 --> 20:13.537
Ha. Trust me, at this point,
I miss the vampires.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.304
Mm. Ha.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.141
You're a hero to this town, Damon.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.477
I know most people don't know it,
but you are.

20:19.651 --> 20:23.781
And you're single, and a catch.
Oh, come on, help me out.

20:23.956 --> 20:27.824
Carol Lockwood won't let me
live it down if I come up empty-handed.

20:29.027 --> 20:34.659
Yeah, a room full of women
clamoring to win a date with me?

20:35.133 --> 20:37.795
- Sounds tasty.
- Ha, thank you.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.494
One thing.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.866
Can you get me information
on someone for me?

20:42.040 --> 20:45.373
Alaric Saltzman, the history teacher?
There's something off about him.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.205
And I just wanna make sure...

20:47.379 --> 20:50.439
...that the high school
did their homework on this guy.

20:50.949 --> 20:53.713
- You got it.
- Thanks.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.019
- May I help you?
- Thank you for the text.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.066
You're welcome.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.591
I didn't tell her anything.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.033
- I kept my promise.
- Good.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.873
- The girl, though, she knew something.
- That won't be a problem.

21:18.076 --> 21:20.544
She won't get any closer to the truth.

21:21.246 --> 21:22.873
Good.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.246
- So I'm done?
- Yes, you're done.

21:30.522 --> 21:32.752
No, I won't invite you in.
You can't come in.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.688
I'm not a vampire. So, yes, I can.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.627
I don't understand.
I did what you told me.

21:39.865 --> 21:41.890
- I did my part.
- And now I have to do mine.

22:21.406 --> 22:25.240
- We can if you like. I'll check it out.
- I believe they're on sale.

22:34.653 --> 22:37.520
- Stefan?
- Better.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.819
- Me.
- You look, um...

22:39.991 --> 22:43.449
Dashing? Gorgeous? Irresistible?

22:43.662 --> 22:47.860
- Wrecked. You looked wrecked.
- No reason why.

22:48.100 --> 22:52.537
Do you know that I am one of
Mystic Falls' most eligible bachelors?

22:52.704 --> 22:54.137
- Huh.
- Yep.

22:56.842 --> 23:00.938
- How are you doing?
- Never better. Yep.

23:01.146 --> 23:05.105
What can I do for you?
I'm a barrel of favors today.

23:05.283 --> 23:08.548
It's my newfound purpose.
How can I help people?

23:08.754 --> 23:12.053
I'm just meeting Stefan.
We're going to the fundraiser.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.186
Help a guy out, will you?

23:15.761 --> 23:17.854
Can't get this...

23:26.571 --> 23:29.768
So I found out who my birth mother is.

23:29.941 --> 23:32.466
Ugh, who cares?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.146
She left you.

23:35.313 --> 23:37.144
She sucks.

23:41.353 --> 23:44.151
Stefan, there you are.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.984
Hey.

23:47.793 --> 23:50.489
Ugh. I need a bigger jacket.

23:50.662 --> 23:53.688
Wow. You know,
an occasional sorority girl...

23:53.865 --> 23:58.393
...might, um, you know,
help fill you out a little bit.

24:03.341 --> 24:04.774
He's fine?

24:04.943 --> 24:07.343
- He's Damon.
- This heartache will be good for him.

24:07.512 --> 24:10.811
It'll remind him that he has one,
even if it doesn't beat.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.343
Won't hold my breath.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.517
So I went to see Trudie Peterson.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.382
I know. I'm sorry, I didn't plan it.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.858
- How was it?
- She has vervain.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.931
She knows about vampires, Stefan.
It can't be a coincidence.

24:30.936 --> 24:36.101
It isn't. This is Alaric's wife.

24:36.274 --> 24:39.471
This is her, this is Isobel.
He gave this to you?

24:39.644 --> 24:42.841
Everything he knows about vampires,
he learned from her.

24:43.048 --> 24:46.779
He believes that she was killed by one.

24:48.119 --> 24:50.144
Oh, my God.

24:50.355 --> 24:53.324
Listen, there's a lot about Isobel
that Alaric can tell you...

24:53.492 --> 24:57.451
...but I need you to hold off a little while
before you talk to him.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.630
- Why?
- I know it's a lot to ask of you...

24:59.798 --> 25:02.426
...but will you do that for me?

25:05.971 --> 25:07.962
Tickets for the raffle are now on sale.

25:08.173 --> 25:11.904
All proceeds benefit
the annual Founder's Day Celebration.

25:12.110 --> 25:15.978
- That's a good look for you.
- Oh, uh, embarrassed and uncomfortable?

25:16.181 --> 25:18.672
Yep, that's the one. Ha-ha-ha.

25:18.917 --> 25:22.409
Hey, look, I'm, uh, sorry about earlier.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.816
It was just kind of a shock.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.288
No, I'm sorry for dropping it on you.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.920
- I felt like you should know.
- No, I get it.

25:31.096 --> 25:33.530
At some point,
maybe you and Elena could talk.

25:33.698 --> 25:36.929
I'm sure she'd like to hear about Isobel,
what she was like.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.801
- Yeah...
- Or not. No pressure.

25:42.173 --> 25:45.165
I don't know if that's a great idea. Ahem.

25:45.343 --> 25:48.107
At least not... Not for a while.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.812
- Where'd our girlfriend go?
- She's on her way to the Grill.

25:54.686 --> 25:58.520
I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.226
This is the woman, Isobel,
from North Carolina.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.553
- Remember her now?
- Who wants to know?

26:04.796 --> 26:06.286
- I do.
- Who else wants to know?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.434
- Did you kill her?
- Sorry, don't know her.

26:11.636 --> 26:13.365
Hey, are you coming?

26:13.538 --> 26:16.735
The real housewives
of Mystic Falls await.

26:16.942 --> 26:20.378
He's already been hit on like 35 times.
He's total cougar bait.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.740
- Impressive.
- More like embarrassing.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.077
Ha, ha. Hi, Mrs. Donovan.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.845
- Elena, honey.
- Ha, ha, hi, Kelly.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.510
- Long time no see.
- How are you?

26:30.689 --> 26:33.351
Same old.
Oh. Matty tells me you broke his heart.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.085
- Mom.
- Just kidding. Calm down.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.888
He found his rebound girl.

26:38.897 --> 26:41.832
Well, here you go, sweetheart.
However many that'll buy.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.934
I just hope I don't get Bachelor 3.
Dated him in high school.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.663
Not impressive, ha. In any way.

26:50.508 --> 26:52.100
Very exciting.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.187
Oh, I've got the big date planned.

27:03.388 --> 27:06.619
It's a romantic dinner, secluded spot,
somewhere woodsy.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.952
You're making me think
I should buy a ticket.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.426
Well, you are in charge.
You could always rig it.

27:13.932 --> 27:15.866
- I thought that was nice.
- Mm.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.763
Pardon me.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.305
I ran the check on the history teacher.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.441
You want this
before or after your debut?

27:24.609 --> 27:26.076
- How's it look?
- He checks out.

27:26.244 --> 27:28.542
Couple of speeding tickets.
Rough story, though.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.238
His wife went missing
years back in North Carolina.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.542
North Carolina?

27:34.919 --> 27:38.082
- She have a name?
- Yeah. Isobel.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.322
Isobel.

27:58.476 --> 28:01.036
And what do you do, Bachelor Number 3?

28:01.246 --> 28:04.545
- Yeah, I'm a plumber.
- Well, isn't that wonderful?

28:04.749 --> 28:08.116
We could always use more plumbers.
Moving on.

28:08.620 --> 28:13.319
Number 4, Alaric Saltzman.
Wow, that's quite a mouthful.

28:13.558 --> 28:16.322
- What do you do?
- I'm a teacher at Mystic Falls High.

28:16.895 --> 28:20.422
Oh, beauty and brains, ladies.
This one's a keeper.

28:21.332 --> 28:22.390
What do you teach?

28:22.567 --> 28:24.125
- History.
- History.

28:24.302 --> 28:26.600
Oh, well,
give us a fun fact about Mystic Falls.

28:26.771 --> 28:27.965
Something crazy.

28:32.077 --> 28:34.568
Uh, well...

28:35.346 --> 28:38.474
He's probably saving the best stories
for his date.

28:38.650 --> 28:43.349
And last but not least,
Damon Salvatore.

28:43.588 --> 28:47.649
- We don't have much on you.
- Well, I'm tough to fit on a card.

28:47.859 --> 28:49.793
Do you have any hobbies Like to travel?

28:49.994 --> 28:55.432
Oh, yeah. L.A., New York.
Couple years ago I was in North Carolina.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.331
Near the Duke campus, actually.
I think Alaric went to school there.

28:59.504 --> 29:00.801
Didn't you, Rick?

29:01.005 --> 29:03.872
Yeah, because I know your wife did.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.039
I had a drink with her once.

29:07.779 --> 29:10.942
She was, phew. She was a great girl.
Did I ever tell you that?

29:11.950 --> 29:13.178
Because she was...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.618
...delicious.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.757
Mm! Mm-mm-mm.

29:25.663 --> 29:28.655
- Are you okay?
- I just need some air.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.236
Elena.

29:35.406 --> 29:37.966
He killed her?
Damon was the vampire that killed her?

29:38.143 --> 29:40.202
I don't know.
They never found the body.

29:40.378 --> 29:43.211
- Oh, my God. Stefan.
- I know, I'm sorry.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.544
I wanted to tell you, but I just...
I wanted to know more.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.743
I was feeling sorry for him...

29:48.920 --> 29:51.787
...hoping that this whole Katherine thing
would change him.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.884
- I'm so stupid.
- He doesn't know the connection to you.

29:55.059 --> 29:58.893
- I thought about confronting him, but...
- Why are you protecting him?

29:59.097 --> 30:03.659
Because you're not the only one
hoping that he might actually change.

30:10.909 --> 30:12.672
That man.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.738
I saw that man outside of Trudie's.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.808
Get back inside. Come on.

30:23.822 --> 30:29.055
And Bachelor Number 3
goes to 37458.

30:29.227 --> 30:30.854
That's me.

30:32.363 --> 30:35.264
Oh. Kelly Donovan. Lovely.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.265
You and the plumber
should have so much fun.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.928
Congratulations, Mrs. Donovan.

30:42.106 --> 30:45.974
Okay, just stop. Stop trying so hard.

30:46.211 --> 30:49.237
This thing you're doing, this nice thing?
It's fake.

30:49.447 --> 30:50.709
Like you, like your mom.

30:50.882 --> 30:54.409
And for some reason, Matt fell for it,
but that doesn't mean that I will.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.110
I don't like you, okay?

30:56.721 --> 30:59.281
So tell plumber boy I'll be at the bar.

31:02.894 --> 31:05.624
Whoa. Easy.
Buy a ticket like everyone else.

31:05.797 --> 31:06.855
Did you enjoy that?

31:07.065 --> 31:09.829
- Rubbing it in to Alaric Saltzman?
- What?

31:10.001 --> 31:13.129
I was starting to think there was
something redeemable about you.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.999
- Elena.
- Am I missing something here?

31:16.174 --> 31:18.802
Did I forget to mention earlier
when we were talking...

31:18.977 --> 31:20.968
...about my birth mother,
the one that gave me up?

31:21.145 --> 31:22.373
Mm-hm.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.980
Her name was Isobel.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.683
Go ahead.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.322
Reminisce about how you killed her.

31:43.701 --> 31:45.191
Come on, let's get you home.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.602
- I have a message for you.
- What?

31:48.773 --> 31:50.206
- Who are you?
- Stop looking.

31:50.942 --> 31:53.433
- Stop looking for what?
- She doesn't wanna know you.

31:53.645 --> 31:56.136
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

31:56.314 --> 31:58.214
- Isobel?
- You need to stop looking.

31:58.783 --> 32:01.183
- Do you understand?
- She's alive?

32:01.352 --> 32:02.717
Does that mean she's a...?

32:02.954 --> 32:04.979
- He's under compulsion.
- Do you understand?

32:05.189 --> 32:07.817
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

32:11.229 --> 32:12.287
I'm done now.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.613
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.848
Three seven six four nine.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.413
- That's me.
- Congratulations.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.649
Oh, not me.

32:43.728 --> 32:47.357
And Bachelor Number 5,
Damon Salvatore.

32:48.433 --> 32:51.163
Three seven five five two.

32:51.369 --> 32:54.236
Oh, would you look at that?
Three seven five five two.

32:54.439 --> 32:56.066
What are the chances? Me.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.639
Aw.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.871
Where'd he go?

33:00.378 --> 33:02.642
I'll call you later.

33:06.351 --> 33:08.945
Don't you think it's time
to let this vampire crap go?

33:09.120 --> 33:11.714
The research, the trips.
It's become an obsession.

33:11.889 --> 33:15.052
- This is important to me, Rick.
- Why? Why is it so important?

33:15.259 --> 33:17.693
Explain it to me.
I mean, make me understand.

33:22.834 --> 33:25.462
I mean, what's the point of this?
You don't want kids.

33:25.636 --> 33:28.230
You're barely ever home.
I want us to be normal people.

33:28.406 --> 33:34.538
Maybe I don't want to.
Maybe I want more.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.049
Here we go, home sweet home.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.053
Wait, why are we back here?
I wasn't ready to leave.

33:45.223 --> 33:46.850
Yeah, you were, Mom.

33:50.495 --> 33:53.828
- You're the best, Matty.
- I know.

33:54.032 --> 33:58.162
I'm... I'm sorry...

33:58.603 --> 33:59.934
...I was gone so long.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.735
Why are you really home, Mom?

34:08.679 --> 34:10.340
It's Pete.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.214
He's gone. And it's all my fault.

34:13.384 --> 34:16.353
- I did it. I always do it.
- No, you didn't, Mom.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.612
It's not your fault.

34:24.262 --> 34:25.956
You're all I have left.

34:28.266 --> 34:29.960
Please don't leave me.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.533
I'm not going anywhere.

34:56.427 --> 34:59.453
Are you really this stupid?

35:04.302 --> 35:05.633
Guess so.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.440
You gonna put down the stake?

35:18.282 --> 35:19.476
Wow.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.174
- That's courage.
- Where's Isobel?

35:22.253 --> 35:23.277
What have you done?

35:23.454 --> 35:26.423
Want me to tell you I killed her?
Will that make you happy?

35:26.624 --> 35:29.092
- You know what happened.
- I saw you feeding on her.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.285
Yeah, I did. And I wasn't lying.

35:33.030 --> 35:34.463
She was delicious.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.664
Son of a... Ugh.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.596
Oh, come on.
What do you think happened?

35:40.805 --> 35:44.263
Not an inkling?
Never considered the possibility?

35:46.410 --> 35:48.310
I turned her.

35:49.647 --> 35:51.205
- Why?
- She came to me.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.610
All pathetic, looking for vampires.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.479
But there was something about her.

35:55.653 --> 36:00.113
- Something I liked, something special.
- You turned her because you liked her?

36:00.291 --> 36:04.318
No, I slept with her because I liked her.
I turned her because she begged me to.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.498
But you knew that too, didn't you? Hm.

36:10.935 --> 36:14.871
I guess she wasn't happy at home.
Wasn't happy with life in general.

36:15.072 --> 36:16.664
Wasn't happy with you.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.403
- This is a shame.
- Ugh!

36:23.581 --> 36:26.812
We're kindred spirits,
abandoned by the women we love.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.679
Unrequited love sucks.

36:31.155 --> 36:33.020
- Sounds like I got a lung.
- Unh.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.523
Which means I get to sit here
and watch you die.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.236
What happened?

37:26.410 --> 37:28.810
- What did you do?
- Do what? He attacked me.

37:31.315 --> 37:33.749
- Damon.
- All I did was tell him the truth.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.820
His wife didn't want him anymore.
Not my fault he couldn't handle it.

37:38.022 --> 37:40.923
- Like you've been handling Katherine?
- I'm handling it fine.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.819
You know what?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.464
Isobel came to me. She found me.

37:47.665 --> 37:50.634
And if she's related to Elena,
she's related to Katherine.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.998
Maybe Katherine sent her to me.

37:54.205 --> 37:57.003
Stop it.
You don't have to keep looking.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.634
It can't be a coincidence
that Isobel sought me out.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.835
Mm-mm. It can't.

38:03.314 --> 38:04.975
I assume you'll take care of this?

38:36.681 --> 38:39.206
What happened? What's going on?

38:39.450 --> 38:40.508
You were just...

38:43.254 --> 38:45.347
Did Damon turn you?

38:46.190 --> 38:48.055
No, I, uh...

38:48.225 --> 38:51.217
I went for him, and then he, uh...
He stabbed me.

38:51.395 --> 38:53.659
No, you must have vampire blood
in your system.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.197
- Somebody slipped it to you.
- No, it's...

38:57.335 --> 39:00.361
- It's something else.
- Then how?

39:02.873 --> 39:04.465
I...

39:05.843 --> 39:07.674
Isobel.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.237
Surprise gifts aren't fair.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.905
I always feel bad
for not getting you something.

39:13.117 --> 39:14.744
Just open it.

39:15.286 --> 39:18.915
Oh, that's a giant piece of jewelry.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.685
I know, it's ridiculous.
Just tell people it's a family heirloom.

39:22.893 --> 39:25.088
- Nobody questions that.
- Where'd you get this?

39:25.262 --> 39:26.991
If I told you, you'd laugh at me.

39:28.499 --> 39:31.059
But promise me
that you'll always wear it.

39:31.268 --> 39:35.227
It'll protect you from all the things
that go bump in the night.

39:35.406 --> 39:37.374
A ring to ward off the demons, huh?

39:37.575 --> 39:39.509
Consider it...

39:39.877 --> 39:42.209
...a token of my love, my affection...

39:42.380 --> 39:46.146
...and if nothing else,
an apology for being so crazy.

39:46.650 --> 39:49.118
Well, you are definitely crazy.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.915
I'm selfish and I am obsessed
and I am a horrible wife.

39:54.658 --> 39:55.886
But you love me anyway.

39:57.561 --> 39:59.222
Yes, I do.

40:01.265 --> 40:03.563
This ring protected me.

40:08.806 --> 40:09.932
That's impossible.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.175
I know.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.809
Was there a problem?

40:55.953 --> 40:58.979
Did you find her? What's going on?

40:59.156 --> 41:00.817
Isobel?

41:29.153 --> 41:31.178
Pearl. It's Harper.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.492
I'm glad you found us. Miss Gibbons?

41:39.330 --> 41:42.595
This gentleman is a friend of mine.
May he come in?

41:42.766 --> 41:47.203
Any friend of Pearl's is a friend of mine.
Please do, come in.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.666
Annabelle, close the door, please.
