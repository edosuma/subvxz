WEBVTT

00:33.658 --> 00:37.120
You have marketing at 11:15,
accounting at 11:25,

00:37.203 --> 00:38.997
and product development at 11:40.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.166
-Tokyo's on the line.
-Tell them "no".

00:41.249 --> 00:43.084
-Who?
-All of them.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.087
Albert.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.466
What happened to your pretty face?

00:50.216 --> 00:53.803
It's, um, last night. He fought back.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.723
-But you got…
-Nothing.

00:56.806 --> 01:00.018
-Fantastic.
-But there might be another way.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.936
Joy.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.273
At the right dosage,
it lowers inhibitions.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.193
-If we mixed it with scopolamine--
-The Alzheimer's drug?

01:08.276 --> 01:09.944
Well, they use high doses for Alzheimer's,

01:10.028 --> 01:12.864
but it was developed
as a truth serum by the CIA.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.451
If I'm right,
that combination could act like, uh…

01:16.534 --> 01:18.161
a sodium pentothal on steroids.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.871
And if you're wrong?

01:19.954 --> 01:23.958
I don't know,
but we're running out of options.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.920
People could know he's here.
They could start asking questions.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.350
Hello, Angel.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.519
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:46.689
I'm a doctor.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.943
Not the kind
that works with patients, really,

01:50.026 --> 01:53.071
but I do know when someone's in pain,

01:53.154 --> 01:57.283
all they really want
is for that pain to end.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.327
Is that what you want?

02:03.915 --> 02:06.042
Because I want to help you.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.795
I'm your friend.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.720
-Wh… what's that?
-Help.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.141
This can take all your pain away.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.893
I just need you
to answer a question first.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.521
Who told you what happened here?

02:30.650 --> 02:32.193
Well?

02:32.277 --> 02:35.488
-You don't have to do this.
-I wish that was true.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.241
-Answer my question or I leave.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.035
And the person that replaces me?
He'll be worse.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.373
He'll be nothing but pain.

02:45.456 --> 02:48.585
And we won't be able to help each other.
Like we can now.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.923
No one.

02:58.887 --> 02:59.929
Wrong answer.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.684
But, hey…

03:07.395 --> 03:09.939
-Let's try anyway.
-Wait.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.816
Tell my father I'm sorry.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.628
What just happened?

03:31.711 --> 03:33.254
I told you it might not work.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.299
-What do we got?
-I can't get a pulse.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.427
Clear.

03:41.137 --> 03:43.473
-Charging.
-I was looking for a mole.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.557
Clear.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.602
You maybe just killed
the only person who could give him to me.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.064
Is it you?

03:51.689 --> 03:52.899
Evelyn.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.153
If I wanted to ruin you, ruin Umbrella,

03:57.237 --> 04:00.073
I could have done it a thousand times.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.908
So fuck off.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.701
Don't.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.872
Why? He won't do anything to me.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.708
Because hurting me hurts Umbrella.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.460
And let's face it, Umbrella…

04:13.962 --> 04:16.130
is all you have.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.011
Mr. Roth.

04:49.747 --> 04:53.084
I want it all packed
and ready to go. Understood?

04:53.167 --> 04:54.294
Move it.

04:56.254 --> 04:57.714
You heard the orders. Go.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.778
We're the same. We're the same.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.573
-Get in!
-Say it again.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.825
Souvenir?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.539
Pack this to go. In my personal stash.

05:33.416 --> 05:38.588
-So how are things?
-"How are things"?

05:39.505 --> 05:43.134
-You took my blood.
-Sorry. Protocol.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.430
I thought you never left
Umbrella territory.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.850
Hmm. Can you blame me?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.520
Evelyn sent me to bring you in.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.731
I told her
it was a waste of time,

05:56.814 --> 05:59.233
but she thinks you could be useful
in the world to come.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.526
"The world to come"?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.737
You should know she's not asking.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.946
She doesn't have to.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.408
She sent
her little toy to do it for her.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.035
Her <i>pet</i> project.

06:10.328 --> 06:14.665
Last I saw you, you were 18 and pregnant
with two busted-out front teeth.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.459
Where's the kid?

06:19.295 --> 06:20.546
I lost it.

06:24.425 --> 06:26.969
-How's Dad?
-Died asking for you.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.350
Yeah. That Albert,
he never minded playing favorites.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.935
I wasn't the favorite.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.146
Maybe not at first.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.567
But then, working on the fringes,
killing yourself to make up for your sins.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.902
Sound familiar?

06:42.985 --> 06:45.029
Our father was a psychopath.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.657
Sure, but we've all got stuff.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.994
Jade, it's time to come in.
Aren't you tired?

06:52.078 --> 06:54.705
Since the last time I saw you,
you did six months in Tokyo,

06:54.789 --> 06:56.624
nearly a year in Greenland.

06:56.707 --> 07:00.336
Until you get caught on the run
with a head in your bag.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.839
Which, I mean, talk about psychopath.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.425
Where were you gals going?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.511
The University.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.597
That's where you were headed,
no pun, right?

07:11.681 --> 07:14.517
Yeah, Baxter
was an efficient weasel.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.395
We've been looking for that place.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.980
Where is it?

07:19.063 --> 07:20.731
-Fuck off.
-Fuck off.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.608
Twins. Jinx.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.904
Clear it out.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.499
Billie, what the fuck is this shit?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.627
I'm not giving you the University.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.254
I'm not going anywhere with you.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.716
And Umbrella,
they don't care about a new world.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.718
They want control.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.597
And you, of all people, should know that
because it's been our whole lives.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.395
I will die before I go back to that place.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.693
That's what I wanted you to say.

08:09.238 --> 08:12.492
Jade, when I chose Umbrella,
I chose wrong.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.827
I should have picked you.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.289
And now,
I guess I just wanted to say goodbye.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.544
-What's that supposed to mean?
-The virus.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.296
-You're immune.
-I'm not.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.092
Sure, it moves slower,
but the clock's still ticking.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.596
Right down to zero.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.642
I just wanted to see you again.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.397
I like to think of you as a happy,

08:43.481 --> 08:46.817
working hard partner who keeps
trying to talk you into having a family.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.152
But then, I worry.

08:50.112 --> 08:53.616
That just feels
a little too settled for Jade Wesker.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.828
We intercepted a signal.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.123
There's a University team looking for you
less than a mile to the west.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.380
You could leave too.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.800
Just because I'm not chained up
doesn't mean I'm free.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.427
There's just one thing
I need you to do.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.054
Punch me in the face.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.180
-What?
-Oh, and…

09:17.515 --> 09:19.225
Stop…

09:23.145 --> 09:25.481
They put a tracker in
when we took your blood.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.743
I never stopped being your sister.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.789
-Jade.
-Gideon.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.207
We've been looking for you.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.756
Amrita.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.343
-I missed you.
-Same, love.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.345
Oy, we need to move.

10:37.428 --> 10:39.347
And we will move. Very quickly.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.849
Tongue.

10:44.268 --> 10:46.187
-Find a new best friend?

10:46.270 --> 10:47.647
It's a specimen.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.524
Amrita, I think this
is what we've been looking for.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.526
Come on. Let's go.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.976
-Take it to the lab. Tell no one.
-Mm-hmm.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.186
Go.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.564
What's up?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.359
My love.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.069
Hey.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.824
-Where's my welcome home committee, huh?
-Oh, right behind me.

11:39.907 --> 11:40.950
Mommy!

11:43.119 --> 11:44.286
Bea.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.331
Mom.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.752
Are you okay?
On the phone, you sounded scared.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.797
I know. I know. But I'm better now. Yeah?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.806
-Are you real?
-Are you real?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.518
Are you okay? Is everyone okay?

12:07.601 --> 12:09.145
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah, we're good.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.481
Mom. I'm playing piano in the talent show.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.234
"Piano"? What happened to ballet?

12:15.317 --> 12:18.404
It's actually pretty impressive.
You're gonna love it.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.281
Yeah, I'm sure I will.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.825
Dad, I have to go.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.162
See you at dinner.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.540
Rehearsal.

12:30.708 --> 12:31.709
Right.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.670
-What?
-What?

12:34.754 --> 12:37.381
I've been gone for six months,
and that's it?

12:37.465 --> 12:39.341
You wanted her
to break down sobbing?

12:39.425 --> 12:42.344
-Rend her clothes?
-No.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.848
Tsk. All right, fine.
Yeah, just a little rending, maybe a tear.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.141
Mm.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.268
I missed you.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.103
Yeah, you better.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.676
I have been fantasizing
about this for months.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.178
-Oh.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.680
-Well, that's very…

13:26.764 --> 13:29.016
-I'm so…
-…flattering.

13:31.227 --> 13:35.231
All right. Tell me what I've been missing.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.650
-Uh…

13:37.733 --> 13:38.651
It's been smooth.

13:38.734 --> 13:42.154
We've had a record crop.
There's been a baby boom.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.616
And, oh, Terrence's group brought back
about half a library from Istanbul.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.451
And what about our

13:47.535 --> 13:49.745
10-going-on-35-year-old daughter?

13:50.663 --> 13:55.751
Uh, well, Bea's progress has been…
It's exceptional.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.629
-I think she might be a bit of a genius.

13:58.712 --> 14:03.926
She does well in mathematics.
She's a natural at science and sports.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.429
But, you know, recently,
the one thing she can't get enough of…

14:08.305 --> 14:09.431
is literature.

14:09.515 --> 14:14.103
Yeah. She's playing the piano now.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.897
-Somebody must be thrilled.
-Yeah.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.942
You know, just be careful.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.903
My father was one of those parents

14:22.987 --> 14:24.947
who tried to raise their kids
to be just like them.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.700
And, uh, he only went one for two.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.620
You sure about that?

14:31.704 --> 14:32.872
Hmm?

14:32.955 --> 14:33.998
I mean, come on.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.834
Tell me you don't want
to be in the lab right now.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.711
I'm not like my father.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.005
-Jade, I wasn't--
-No, I…

14:41.088 --> 14:44.800
When my father did what he did,
he only cared about himself.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.889
When I was out in the field,
for six months, I…

14:49.972 --> 14:52.099
I had nothing to show for it.

14:53.100 --> 14:58.647
So I told myself, stay, finish the job,
so you don't have to leave again.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.482
Yeah.

15:00.566 --> 15:05.154
-And then I found this zero.
-Oh, the head?

15:05.779 --> 15:10.618
You would not believe.
I knew I couldn't just run away.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.661
I knew I had to go back and get it.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.288
Otherwise,
it all would have been for nothing.

15:14.371 --> 15:17.458
And I didn't do that for me.
I did that for her.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.836
You… went back?

15:22.254 --> 15:24.632
What do you mean, "I had to go back"?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.301
At the bunker.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.596
What, the Brotherhood bunker?
The one full of monsters?

15:32.348 --> 15:36.518
You don't get it. It…
This zero could control other zeros.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.562
Okay. It could make them do things.

15:38.646 --> 15:42.399
If I could figure out how,
do you understand what that means?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.568
We… we talked about this, right?

15:44.652 --> 15:47.029
No more unnecessary risks.
No more Kamikaze Jade.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.823
-No. It wasn't like that, okay? I had to.
-No, you didn't.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.908
-No, I did.
-No, you didn't.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.035
And if you think you did that for Bea,
you're lying to yourself.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.079
Of course, I did that for Bea.
Why else…

15:55.162 --> 15:57.039
-Okay. What if she lost you?
-She didn't.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.375
-This time.
-Don't do this.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.170
-I'm the parent here. Me, her mother.
-And I'm what, huh?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.923
The babysitter?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.467
Look, just because I'm not
her biological father, doesn't mean--

16:08.550 --> 16:10.052
Just… just stop.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.447
So…

17:54.156 --> 17:55.074
How did it go?

17:55.157 --> 17:58.285
Ms. Kyoko asked
if I wanted to have dinner there.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.370
Thursday, like usual?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.083
Well, maybe
take this week off, huh?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.876
On account of mom being back.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.920
She'll be working. She won't care.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.507
Hmm.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.262
Hey, remember when we read
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream?</i>

18:17.346 --> 18:19.139
And Shakespeare wrote that,

18:19.223 --> 18:22.101
"The object of art
is to give life a shape."

18:22.184 --> 18:24.019
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:24.103 --> 18:29.066
Well, your mother's work is her art,
and it gives shape to her life.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.443
And she'd be lost without it.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.280
Is that why she's always gone?

18:39.118 --> 18:43.163
When Mom was young,
her daddy tried to fix the world.

18:44.623 --> 18:50.295
But, instead, he made it much, much worse.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.383
And your mother, she's spent
her whole life trying to make up for that.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.093
For him.

18:56.176 --> 18:59.138
That's not fair. She didn't do anything.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.973
No, she didn't.

19:01.932 --> 19:05.477
But it's the second most important thing
to know about her.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.854
What's first?

19:08.689 --> 19:11.608
She loves you more than anything.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.529
-Hey, team.
-Hey, Mom.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.407
-You're not eating?
-We're waiting for you.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.408
Good.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.285
Because I'm going to have
all your portions.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.245
What do you think about that, huh?

19:23.328 --> 19:26.582
We're gonna get all the hot stuff.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.172
She went down fast tonight.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.674
Mm. Must have been all of the excitement.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.345
Arjun.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.889
Hmm?

19:51.523 --> 19:52.983
What I said earlier…

19:54.026 --> 19:55.819
That… that doesn't matter.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.280
No, it does.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.574
Listen.

20:06.747 --> 20:10.417
The day you came into my life…

20:12.169 --> 20:13.337
into Bea's…

20:16.215 --> 20:17.716
I love you.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.893
Wait, wait. Hold on. Wait, wait.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.090
My father is dead.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.389
My sister told me.

21:07.516 --> 21:12.479
Umbrella sent her to bring me back,
but she let me go.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.864
Well, do you…

21:22.948 --> 21:25.117
I mean, can you trust her?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.954
She said she's dying.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.792
Jade.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.713
I'm so sorry.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.634
Part of me is…

21:44.136 --> 21:48.390
…playing memories in my head
like home movies.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.108
But the other part of me wishes
I'd killed her when I had the chance.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.000
Ghost ships drifting, off starboard.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.544
<i>Ghost ships acknowledged.</i>
<i>Suggesting intercept course.</i>

23:02.339 --> 23:03.215
Sorry.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.848
-How far along are you?
-I…

23:14.601 --> 23:15.519
Two months.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.064
We haven't really told anyone.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.692
I'm a bit terrified.

23:23.610 --> 23:26.780
Good. That fear, the adrenaline?

23:26.863 --> 23:29.241
You're gonna need that
through the 2:00 a.m. feedings,

23:29.324 --> 23:32.035
changing diapers.
I mean, have you ever been peed on before?

23:32.119 --> 23:32.953
Once.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.914
-College.
-Okay.

23:35.997 --> 23:39.042
Well, expect a lot more of that.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.877
You make it sound amazing.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.629
It is.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.299
I never wanted kids.

23:47.342 --> 23:51.263
I was… young and alone.

23:53.098 --> 23:58.019
It was the hardest, best thing.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.650
Amrita.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.278
I'm so happy for you.

24:08.029 --> 24:11.366
-So, ready to bust it out?
-Let's do it.

24:13.201 --> 24:17.706
-What's so special about this lovely lady?
-She could control other zeros.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.499
How?

24:20.584 --> 24:22.961
Well, we always knew
the virus would evolve.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.006
But zeros can't see. Most can't hear.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.466
So if she was communicating…

24:27.549 --> 24:29.551
It was through smell.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.053
A pheromone maybe. On her breath.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.768
This gland, right here.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.355
I've never seen anything like it.

24:44.232 --> 24:47.652
Don't let me get too lost in it, okay?
I've got Bea's piano thing.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.155
I've set an alarm. You'll be there.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.093
Okay. Observing the epithelial tissue.

25:16.806 --> 25:20.519
All right, the zero's cells
are putting out two distinct enzymes.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.312
But…

25:22.395 --> 25:24.022
Oh, shit.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.442
Exposure to oxygen breaks them down.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.320
Maybe they have to be mixed
with something?

25:30.403 --> 25:31.988
Like?

25:32.072 --> 25:34.699
If they're going
into her throat, her mouth.

25:36.743 --> 25:37.744
Spit?

25:38.411 --> 25:42.499
<i>Okay. And what's that?</i>
<i>Uh, water, electrolytes, mucus…</i>

25:42.582 --> 25:45.627
<i>Amylase, lipase,</i>
<i>IgA, and lysozymes.</i>

25:45.710 --> 25:47.379
<i>But the ratios…</i>

25:47.462 --> 25:49.756
<i>There are thousands</i>
<i>of possible combinations.</i>

25:52.551 --> 25:53.718
Trial one.

25:57.305 --> 25:58.473
Trial 11.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.935
Trial 22.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.355
Trial 35 .

26:08.608 --> 26:10.151
Trial 44.

26:11.861 --> 26:15.448
And that is the end of trial 55.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.285
I'm calling it.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.080
-We'll start again tomorrow.
-Just… No. One more.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.832
We're almost out of precursors.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.334
We'll need to trade
with one of the other labs.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.421
-We could steal them.
-Jade.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.049
Um…

26:38.597 --> 26:40.390
That's disgusting.

26:40.473 --> 26:43.560
-But it's trial 56.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.582
Disgusting worked.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.130
The sample.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.966
It's stable.

27:15.592 --> 27:18.219
Fuck me.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.806
-I…

27:21.890 --> 27:23.642
-Bea.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.311
-Go. I'll start isolating them.
-But…

27:26.936 --> 27:29.981
-I'll page you the second they're ready.
-Okay. But, you know, they're delicate.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.275
-You have to be careful when--
-Jade. Go.

27:32.359 --> 27:34.069
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.403
-Thank you.
-Go.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.783
-And… and get samples!
-Yes! Go!

27:56.424 --> 27:58.927
-Where is Arjun?
-Forget him. Where's my wife?

27:59.010 --> 28:01.596
-Working.
-Of course.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.015
Did you even stop for lunch?

28:05.433 --> 28:07.894
-She needs to eat.
-Yeah, for two.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.564
-Like she wouldn't tell me.

28:15.777 --> 28:19.197
I want to welcome friends,
family, and parents

28:19.280 --> 28:21.783
to a celebration of arts and culture,

28:21.866 --> 28:26.121
into which I can tell you
we have poured all of our hearts.

28:30.125 --> 28:35.463
So why teach children poetry,
Shakespeare, dance, and music now,

28:35.547 --> 28:37.549
at this point of our history?

28:37.632 --> 28:39.134
Well, I think we're all dedicated

28:39.217 --> 28:42.429
to collecting everything we can
from our past

28:42.512 --> 28:44.806
and preserving it
in our collective memory,

28:44.889 --> 28:49.602
because that is what the arts were
in their most ancient beginnings.

28:49.686 --> 28:54.315
It was a way to imprint deep,
emotional stories on our souls.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.484
Stories we didn't want to lose,

28:56.568 --> 29:01.990
because even in times like these,
we are the stories we tell.

29:05.535 --> 29:06.828
Bea?

29:20.800 --> 29:22.761
-Ooh!

31:06.281 --> 31:11.202
Introducing the first enzyme
to a sample of the T-virus.

31:16.791 --> 31:20.420
I mean, the virus
is going nowhere near this enzyme.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.629
Pass me the other one.

31:38.396 --> 31:41.274
And it's as if this enzyme attracts it.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.903
-So if it went airborne…
-"Airborne."

31:44.986 --> 31:48.406
And then, you could mark a target
and send zeros after it.

31:48.489 --> 31:51.534
-But with the red…
-Keep them away.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.499
Jade.

31:59.542 --> 32:04.714
If this is right, we need to test it.
On a real zero.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.758
We just have
to get permission first.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.594
Dock the ship, and wait two weeks.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.472
And we will.

32:14.557 --> 32:17.018
If I don't get you back to Paolo
at a reasonable hour,

32:17.101 --> 32:19.395
-he's gonna kick my ass.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.108
Here you go.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.395
-Hey.
-Oh, shit!

34:24.479 --> 34:25.605
Serene.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.190
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.943
-Hey. Uh, you're up early.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.821
Yeah, you know,
it's just so loud in the field,

34:33.905 --> 34:35.907
-I think you get used to it.
-Hmm.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.993
-Need help with that?
-Oh, no, it's all right. I got it.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.330
-All right.
-Thanks.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.189
Mom?

35:08.815 --> 35:09.649
Bea.

35:11.359 --> 35:12.860
I came to bring you some…

35:14.570 --> 35:15.530
What did you do?

35:15.613 --> 35:19.117
Hey, it's okay. Everything's okay.
You're with me, so you're safe.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.703
I've got this all under control.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.334
She just came out of the cold water.
What happens to zeros in the cold?

35:29.001 --> 35:30.586
-They slow down.
-Exactly.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.344
Does Dad know?

35:40.054 --> 35:43.224
Here, I'm gonna show you something.

35:43.307 --> 35:46.811
But you have to stay way over here, okay?

35:46.894 --> 35:52.775
When I was away, I found a zero
who could talk to other zeros.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.155
-Zeros can't talk.
-Not with words.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.075
Now, you see this?

36:01.159 --> 36:04.370
This is a pheromone.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.289
It's like a… a smell.

36:06.372 --> 36:09.542
And when zeros smell it,
they can't hurt you.

36:10.126 --> 36:13.504
If we put this on people
on the ship, on entire cities,

36:13.588 --> 36:17.800
we could build a whole new world,
make things like they used to be.

36:18.801 --> 36:22.722
Dad said when he was a kid,
he could have ice cream every day,

36:22.805 --> 36:24.348
not just on New Year's.

36:25.016 --> 36:30.146
Well, you can have ice cream
and you can do anything you want.

36:30.730 --> 36:33.024
That's the world I want for you, Bea.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.194
-Okay.
-Yeah?

36:36.277 --> 36:38.863
But right now,
I gotta figure out if this thing works.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.451
You stay right there by the door.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.462
Okay.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.190
-Mom?
-It's okay.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.525
She won't even know I'm here.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.361
It worked!

38:03.114 --> 38:05.658
Bea! Get out! Go!

38:13.749 --> 38:15.084
-Run!

38:28.639 --> 38:29.682
Help!

38:33.894 --> 38:35.146
Help!

38:37.815 --> 38:40.359
-What's wrong?
-Over there! There!

39:02.423 --> 39:04.508
Bea? Bea?

39:05.426 --> 39:06.427
Bea?

39:12.558 --> 39:13.893
-No!

39:13.976 --> 39:15.102
What was it?

39:15.686 --> 39:16.812
Oh, God.

39:17.396 --> 39:19.899
-No.
-Paolo!

39:21.609 --> 39:24.195
-Bea?
-Dad!

39:24.278 --> 39:26.155
-Are there more?
-I don't know.

39:26.238 --> 39:27.114
No.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.575
It's…

39:29.658 --> 39:31.118
It's my fault.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.371
I brought it on the ship.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.039
-I was trying to test.
-It's your fault?

39:35.122 --> 39:36.832
I… I didn't think that I…

39:37.458 --> 39:39.335
We… we were working…

39:39.418 --> 39:41.045
You killed her.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.767
-It's coming! Heads up!
-You see them?

39:54.850 --> 39:56.811
Choppers incoming.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.178
Here we go.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.389
-I want to know what killed him.
-Yes, ma'am.

40:35.057 --> 40:37.059
Let's take a look.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.370
Interesting.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.124
This is insane!

41:02.835 --> 41:04.336
<i>You can't keep me here.</i>

41:17.057 --> 41:19.310
Since when are you
such a scaredy-cat?

41:35.951 --> 41:37.036
Hey, bro.
