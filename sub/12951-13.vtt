00:28.128 --> 00:30.628
# Back in black,
I hit the sack #

00:30.697 --> 00:32.931
# I've been too long,
I'm glad to be back #

00:32.932 --> 00:35.924
# Yes, I'm let loose
from the noose #

00:36.036 --> 00:38.070
# That's kept me
hangin' about #

00:38.071 --> 00:41.234
# I've been lookin' at the sky
'cause it's gettin' me high #

00:41.341 --> 00:44.435
# Forget the hearse
'cause I never die #

00:45.578 --> 00:48.078
Non.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.511
# Well, I'm back in black #

00:53.653 --> 00:57.054
# Yes, I'm back in black #

00:58.124 --> 01:00.888
# Oh, yeah #

01:00.994 --> 01:03.494
# Oh, yeah #

01:05.932 --> 01:08.432
# Yeah, yeah #

01:15.942 --> 01:19.036
# Well, I'm back #

01:19.145 --> 01:21.280
# Back #

01:27.520 --> 01:29.555
# Back #

01:29.556 --> 01:31.890
# Back #

01:31.891 --> 01:34.391
# Back in black #

02:02.889 --> 02:05.824
What was wrong
with the black one?

02:07.093 --> 02:11.393
Do you think it's comfortable
wearing clothes like this?

02:11.498 --> 02:15.434
This isn't my first day.
I disconnected your call button.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.299
I know who you are.
I know what this plane is.

02:18.404 --> 02:20.806
I don't know what
you're talking about!

02:20.807 --> 02:23.041
Tell me how to
access server 47.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.411
Over there.

02:26.412 --> 02:29.313
Behind the frame.
There's a terminal.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.025
# Come on #

02:40.026 --> 02:41.860
# Come on #

02:41.861 --> 02:43.562
# Come on #

02:43.563 --> 02:45.063
# Come on #

02:45.064 --> 02:47.065
# Come on #

02:47.066 --> 02:49.566
# Come on #

02:49.869 --> 02:52.369
We're transmitting.

05:29.931 --> 05:32.196
Mountaineer requests
covert entry.

05:32.197 --> 05:34.697
Roger that.
Mountaineer's clear for entry.

05:46.895 --> 05:49.361
Okay. So, what's the new intel?

05:49.362 --> 05:51.862
Kendall wouldn't say.
Wait for the meeting.

05:51.896 --> 05:53.027
I ran by the park.

05:53.028 --> 05:56.424
There were people playing
frisbee, having picnics.

05:56.528 --> 05:59.186
- In the middle of a work day?
- Just hanging out?

05:59.294 --> 06:02.123
Let's move. Did you tell her
about the transfers?

06:02.228 --> 06:05.125
Some recruits from Langley
are gonna be observing.

06:05.228 --> 06:07.728
Now, wait.
Before the meeting...

06:17.794 --> 06:19.292
I'm gonna say something.

06:19.293 --> 06:21.526
And it'll either be
obvious to you

06:21.527 --> 06:23.025
or seem presumptuous.

06:23.026 --> 06:25.291
Either way,
I've got to say it.

06:25.292 --> 06:27.358
This isn't working.

06:27.359 --> 06:28.725
I've been thinking.

06:28.726 --> 06:31.226
I don't know
what the hell to do.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.024
What?

06:34.025 --> 06:36.525
I think you know what.

06:38.358 --> 06:41.482
- I need you to tell me.
- You need me to tell you what?

06:41.591 --> 06:44.181
That when you're on operations,
I can't sleep?

06:44.291 --> 06:46.656
That in debrief
I have to force myself

06:46.657 --> 06:49.022
to remember what we're reviewing

06:49.023 --> 06:51.523
when all I want to do
is kiss you?

07:01.023 --> 07:03.489
Sometimes it is
hard to remember.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.455
That's what I'm talking about.

07:05.456 --> 07:07.189
The thing that makes me crazy

07:07.190 --> 07:10.586
is the people that would kill us
if we were seen together...

07:10.690 --> 07:12.422
The Alliance, SD-6, Sloane...

07:12.423 --> 07:15.444
are the very forces
that brought you into my life.

07:15.555 --> 07:17.488
What kind of
a sick joke is that?

07:17.489 --> 07:19.989
So we shouldn't
be working together?

07:20.055 --> 07:22.917
That's what I was thinking.
But we are great together.

07:23.021 --> 07:24.687
- I know.
- The more we work together...

07:24.688 --> 07:27.653
the sooner The Alliance
gets destroyed.

07:27.755 --> 07:30.255
So what are you suggesting?

07:30.321 --> 07:32.220
What is this?
The flirting corner?

07:32.221 --> 07:34.520
- We're talking.
- I figured that out.

07:34.521 --> 07:35.719
There's a meeting.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.486
National security.
Remember?

07:37.487 --> 07:39.419
It's important.
For the people.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.920
We'll be right there.

07:57.619 --> 07:58.984
Arvin Sloane.

07:58.985 --> 08:00.485
As most of you know,

08:00.486 --> 08:03.178
Sloane is the
acting director of SD-6.

08:03.285 --> 08:05.785
For those of you
new to the fun and games,

08:05.852 --> 08:08.681
SD-6 is an arm
of The Alliance,

08:08.785 --> 08:11.477
a worldwide
organized-crime syndicate

08:11.585 --> 08:14.311
responsible for weapons trade,
drug traffic, murder.

08:14.417 --> 08:17.348
The Alliance keeps
a dozen offices, or cells.

08:17.450 --> 08:20.471
SD-1 through SD-12.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.549
We have identified
the location of seven cells.

08:23.649 --> 08:25.582
The rest is speculation.

08:25.583 --> 08:29.480
The agents Bristow have been
working undercover at SD-6,

08:29.583 --> 08:32.376
tracking their objectives,
operations, contacts.

08:32.482 --> 08:34.813
Working under Arvin Sloane.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.048
Until now.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.048
We've intercepted
communications.

08:39.049 --> 08:42.946
The Alliance has picked someone
to be Sloane's replacement.

08:43.048 --> 08:44.382
Anthony Geiger.

08:44.383 --> 08:47.212
Which is about as much
as I can tell you about him.

08:47.315 --> 08:49.815
Geiger has no file at CIA, FBI.

08:49.914 --> 08:53.107
No police records.
No overdue video rentals.

08:53.215 --> 08:55.047
- Nothing.
- Excuse me.

08:55.048 --> 08:57.013
Sloane's being replaced?

08:57.014 --> 08:59.213
He's been MIA for five days.

08:59.214 --> 09:00.847
With Sloane gone,

09:00.848 --> 09:03.313
we no longer have access to
their inner circle.

09:03.314 --> 09:07.108
Sydney, Jack, your assignment
is to get close to Geiger.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.746
Earn his trust.

09:08.747 --> 09:11.213
Get back inside
that inner circle.

09:11.214 --> 09:13.714
That's it.

09:14.413 --> 09:18.276
Dad, the one person in the world
I want brought to justice,

09:18.380 --> 09:19.445
he's disappeared.

09:19.446 --> 09:22.104
I've been doing this
a long time, Sydney.

09:22.212 --> 09:24.712
There's rarely an end
to the story.

09:52.343 --> 09:56.137
I don't like it.
Whatever's happening here.

10:02.376 --> 10:04.608
Excuse me.
Mr. Geiger?

10:04.609 --> 10:05.608
Yes?

10:05.609 --> 10:07.574
Sydney Bristow.

10:07.575 --> 10:10.075
Come in.
sit down.

10:13.142 --> 10:14.974
Let's see...

10:14.975 --> 10:17.940
I just wanted to
introduce myself, say hello.

10:18.075 --> 10:22.233
What can you tell me
about Danny?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.906
What would you like to know?

10:26.907 --> 10:29.407
You were engaged?

10:30.374 --> 10:31.439
Yes.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.172
Well, tell me something more.

10:33.173 --> 10:36.297
I assume you mean
how Danny died.

10:36.406 --> 10:38.906
I told him the truth.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.827
That I worked for SD-6.

10:42.939 --> 10:45.004
Security Section
discovered this.

10:45.005 --> 10:47.505
They told Sloane.

10:47.539 --> 10:50.039
Sloane had him killed.

10:50.172 --> 10:52.672
What kind of doctor
was he gonna be?

10:53.405 --> 10:57.199
- A pediatric cardiologist.
- Really?

10:57.306 --> 10:59.806
Well, that's unusual.

11:00.771 --> 11:03.170
Did he like kids?

11:03.171 --> 11:08.296
Danny had a younger brother
who was born with a condition.

11:08.404 --> 11:10.570
A heart condition.

11:10.571 --> 11:14.058
And they were told
there was no treatment.

11:24.070 --> 11:27.899
If the people I work for
would assassinate my wife,

11:28.002 --> 11:31.865
I would not show up
at the office the next day.

11:31.968 --> 11:34.201
So why come back?

11:34.202 --> 11:36.702
What for?

11:37.369 --> 11:39.601
The precepts of SD-6
were made clear to me

11:39.602 --> 11:40.966
when I was recruited.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.467
What happened was my fault.

11:44.701 --> 11:48.722
And I am a faithful
officer of this agency.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.632
Thanks for coming in.

11:52.633 --> 11:55.757
New boss has a dreadful
personality, don't you think?

11:55.867 --> 11:58.367
I've seen worse.

11:58.633 --> 12:01.826
- Am I to take that personally?
- Sark, what do you want?

12:01.966 --> 12:05.658
When I met with Geiger, I left
feeling as unstrung as you look.

12:05.766 --> 12:09.027
Just so you know,
I'm fully strung.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.665
We all have secrets, Sydney.

12:12.666 --> 12:14.897
And from what I've heard
about Geiger,

12:14.898 --> 12:17.398
he'll discover them.

12:18.498 --> 12:20.398
What have you heard
about Geiger?

12:20.399 --> 12:22.231
Former German Intelligence.

12:22.232 --> 12:24.924
Has more enemies
than various other Germans

12:25.032 --> 12:26.230
we're familiar with.

12:26.231 --> 12:28.697
He seems to think
Sloane is a traitor.

12:28.698 --> 12:31.719
He's unlocked Sloane's
secret files on server 47.

12:31.864 --> 12:34.693
There are only 46 servers.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.463
Really?

12:36.464 --> 12:39.452
Well, he announced it to me
as if it were a victory.

12:39.596 --> 12:42.789
"I've already hacked
Sloane's files on server 47."

12:44.396 --> 12:46.896
There's only one reason
Sloane would keep secret

12:46.930 --> 12:49.362
the existence of a computer.

12:49.363 --> 12:52.487
Because this computer,
server 47, is a vulnerability.

12:52.596 --> 12:55.096
Tell me what you're suggesting.

12:55.196 --> 12:58.524
I think there's a central
Alliance computer. Server 47.

12:58.628 --> 13:00.828
A network that links
all the SD cells.

13:00.829 --> 13:02.427
It makes sense, doesn't it?

13:02.428 --> 13:04.260
I'm trying to find
a flaw in this.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.061
I want to find this computer.

13:06.062 --> 13:07.061
If I'm right,

13:07.062 --> 13:09.856
it could tell us names
of The Alliance partners,

13:09.961 --> 13:11.561
locations of offices...

13:11.562 --> 13:13.526
- Sydney...
- Dad...

13:13.527 --> 13:16.027
This could be
the silver bullet.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.293
I'll get CIA to sanction it.

13:18.294 --> 13:20.094
We tracked down server 47.

13:20.095 --> 13:24.151
You couldn't get a 20 on it
because it's in the sky.

13:24.259 --> 13:27.315
It's a 747 purchased
by The Alliance in 1998.

13:27.426 --> 13:28.425
They retrofitted the interior

13:28.426 --> 13:30.691
to contain
a server and satellite uplink.

13:30.692 --> 13:32.325
They keep the computer
airborne?

13:32.326 --> 13:33.858
It only lands for refueling.

13:33.859 --> 13:36.688
The Alliance has this man
overseeing the operation.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.723
Gils Nacor.
He's a computer security expert.

13:39.826 --> 13:42.024
He travels with the server.

13:42.025 --> 13:44.922
This guy spends his life
on a plane with a computer?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.523
It's a really nice plane.

13:46.524 --> 13:49.545
How did they convince an
upper-level asset to do that?

13:49.658 --> 13:51.191
They provide women.

13:51.192 --> 13:53.623
- You're kidding me.
- Nope. Twice a week.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.248
Airports in England and Spain.
Escort agency provides a new...

13:57.358 --> 13:58.389
friend.

13:58.390 --> 13:59.889
I have to be his friend.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.989
No, you just have to
get him alone.

14:01.990 --> 14:04.122
Computer's in the belly
of the plane.

14:04.123 --> 14:06.389
There are terminal accesses
in the main cabin.

14:06.390 --> 14:08.723
We're going to Barcelona.
We have a team.

14:08.724 --> 14:10.922
They'll ambush
the drop-off of his date.

14:10.923 --> 14:12.556
They'll deliver you
in her place.

14:12.557 --> 14:15.419
Get onto the plane,
access the server,

14:15.522 --> 14:17.122
and transmit its contents.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.755
We'll be in a cargo jet.

14:18.756 --> 14:21.380
We have to stay
within 5,000 feet.

14:21.489 --> 14:22.421
Here's your transmitter.

14:22.422 --> 14:23.987
The earrings will give us
audio and video.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.544
Op-tech has
the rest of your gear.

14:26.656 --> 14:29.156
Guys, we should get
to the plane.

14:37.620 --> 14:40.120
Okay, whenever you want
to have that talk...

14:40.154 --> 14:41.419
What talk?

14:41.420 --> 14:43.920
About the cologne.
Whatever you're wearing.

14:43.954 --> 14:45.919
I'm not wearing any cologne.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.851
No man naturally smells
as good as you do right now.

14:48.953 --> 14:51.453
Okay, your camera's on.
Here we go.

15:05.318 --> 15:07.018
Non.

15:08.618 --> 15:10.317
That son of a bitch.

15:10.318 --> 15:12.818
Easy. Come on.

15:16.218 --> 15:18.718
I swear,
I'm gonna kill this guy.

15:25.751 --> 15:27.917
No way that guy smells
as good as you.

15:27.918 --> 15:30.474
It's aftershave.
I got new aftershave.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.483
Yeah, well,
I'd lighten up on it.

15:32.484 --> 15:33.782
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

15:33.783 --> 15:36.283
Yeah, to the point of non-use.

15:37.949 --> 15:41.471
Tell me
how to access server 47.

15:41.583 --> 15:45.173
Behind the frame.
There's a terminal.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.615
All right, get going.

15:52.582 --> 15:54.247
- We're transmitting.
- Got it.

15:54.248 --> 15:55.747
We should be at Heathrow
in an hour.

15:55.748 --> 15:56.747
Team's in place.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.248
I'm going to take out the guard.

16:13.313 --> 16:16.039
Throw the gun.
Make him reach for it.

16:42.311 --> 16:45.435
You think you can steal
from us, you little bitch?!

16:49.211 --> 16:50.943
No! No, no, no, no!

18:03.105 --> 18:05.605
Oh, my God.

18:17.637 --> 18:20.137
She's all yours.

18:28.602 --> 18:31.102
Guess what.
Sydney's gonna be late again.

18:31.203 --> 18:32.835
She's missing the dirty work.

18:32.836 --> 18:35.201
- Look at these guys.
- Oh, no.

18:35.202 --> 18:36.302
It's gonna be fine.

18:36.303 --> 18:38.803
I hate this part.

18:42.535 --> 18:45.227
Okay, the suspense
is killing me.

18:45.335 --> 18:46.634
What's the occasion?

18:46.635 --> 18:49.963
The restaurant is actually
making a profit.

18:50.068 --> 18:52.692
After only six months?
Is that even possible?

18:52.801 --> 18:55.132
Yes. Hence the lobster dinner.

18:55.133 --> 18:57.962
If anyone told me I would
be making this work,

18:58.067 --> 19:00.299
my own restaurant...

19:00.300 --> 19:03.732
It's just unbelievable.

19:04.767 --> 19:08.289
I guess this is a really bad
time to tell you I have to quit.

19:08.399 --> 19:11.831
I got a job working
for a travel magazine.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.727
It's not "The New York Times,"
but I am writing for a living.

19:15.832 --> 19:19.093
That is genius. I love
that you're writing again.

19:19.199 --> 19:20.731
- You're okay with it?
- Yeah.

19:20.732 --> 19:23.253
I can't find another
waiter in Los Angeles?

19:23.365 --> 19:26.159
- Francie, you're the best.
- Congratulations.

19:44.197 --> 19:46.697
Analysis got done
with the hard drive.

19:54.330 --> 19:56.988
sir, this is our chance
to destroy The Alliance!

19:57.096 --> 19:59.856
Miss Bristow, thank you.
I understand.

19:59.962 --> 20:01.861
But you don't rush an operation.

20:01.862 --> 20:03.895
As soon as The Alliance
realizes there's a breach,

20:03.896 --> 20:06.622
- this info won't be valid.
- You may recall the 150 pounds

20:06.729 --> 20:09.750
of C-4 explosives
in the subbasement at SD-6

20:09.861 --> 20:11.760
and probably
every other SD cell.

20:11.761 --> 20:13.328
If this intel is wrong,

20:13.329 --> 20:15.393
we're talking
the death of civilians.

20:15.394 --> 20:16.527
The answer is in the document.

20:16.528 --> 20:18.893
According to the information,

20:18.894 --> 20:21.484
each SD cell uses a code
which changes weekly

20:21.628 --> 20:23.193
to operate their security.

20:23.194 --> 20:25.193
The current code is right here.

20:25.194 --> 20:28.250
We need to get into SD-6 and
find out what the code is now?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.559
If it matches,
then the intel is real.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.718
In which case, I could go to
Langley about raiding Alliance.

20:33.827 --> 20:36.621
- Do we have the current code?
- No.

20:36.726 --> 20:39.226
But I can get it.

20:40.925 --> 20:44.357
Did you like the salmon, Will?

20:44.459 --> 20:45.992
I was gonna say that.

20:45.993 --> 20:48.491
- Really?
- Yeah, I thought it was great.

20:48.492 --> 20:50.624
- I thought it was amazing.
- Really?

20:50.625 --> 20:52.624
- Was that a new sauce?
- Yeah.

20:52.625 --> 20:54.224
- It was great.
- Thank you.

20:54.225 --> 20:56.725
I'm glad you noticed it.
Thanks.

20:56.858 --> 20:58.956
Did you know that guy
at table 45?

20:58.957 --> 21:01.457
- No.
- He was totally looking at you.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.623
He was not looking at me.

21:03.624 --> 21:05.890
What's going on?

21:05.891 --> 21:07.356
- What?
- What?

21:07.357 --> 21:08.289
What?

21:08.290 --> 21:10.846
You guys are both acting
like you're on drugs.

21:10.957 --> 21:13.717
Um, well, um...

21:13.824 --> 21:16.222
We sort of made out.

21:16.223 --> 21:17.288
Oh, my God.

21:17.289 --> 21:19.789
Okay, this is too weird.

21:22.756 --> 21:24.954
You called for me?

21:24.955 --> 21:27.322
I've been reviewing
Mr. Sloane's work.

21:27.323 --> 21:31.777
I found an e-mail
that struck me as curious.

21:31.922 --> 21:34.254
Is SD-6 running a program

21:34.255 --> 21:36.811
recording keystrokes
at each desktop?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.220
Yes, sir, of course.

21:38.221 --> 21:40.054
Well, then...

21:40.055 --> 21:41.454
Why don't you sit down?

21:41.455 --> 21:47.181
I'd like you to play back
what Arvin Sloane was typing.

21:49.987 --> 21:52.153
Literally every detail now.

21:52.154 --> 21:54.519
We were in the kitchen.
All of a sudden...

21:54.520 --> 21:56.452
I can't believe this.
I'm in shock.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.186
- Good shock?
- No, great shock.

21:58.187 --> 22:00.708
- Is this a one-time thing?
- I don't know.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.545
You know the really weird part?
It wasn't weird.

22:06.819 --> 22:09.840
- I'm gonna have fun with this.
- Oh, jeez.

22:09.951 --> 22:10.951
Here we go.

22:10.952 --> 22:13.452
This is a playback
of Arvin Sloane

22:13.552 --> 22:15.617
as he wrote the e-mail
in question.

22:15.618 --> 22:18.118
Okay.

22:18.785 --> 22:21.579
Wait. He wrote something
and then erased it.

22:21.686 --> 22:24.186
- Play it back slow.
- Certainly.

22:53.782 --> 22:56.282
Jack Bristow?

22:59.348 --> 23:01.447
Anthony Geiger.

23:01.448 --> 23:03.048
I've been looking forward
to this.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.549
Me as well.

23:12.681 --> 23:13.647
Yeah?

23:13.648 --> 23:16.374
Sydney, it's me.
I'm talking to Mr. Geiger.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.812
He'd like you to
come in right away.

23:18.813 --> 23:20.946
Oh, and take surface streets.

23:20.947 --> 23:23.447
They're doing some work
on the freeway.

23:29.579 --> 23:31.612
Okay, I will.

23:31.613 --> 23:34.113
See you soon.

23:40.945 --> 23:43.445
Did he get the code?

23:43.779 --> 23:46.279
Syd?

23:47.045 --> 23:49.344
- He was compromised.
- What?

23:49.345 --> 23:52.741
He just said,
"Take the surface streets. "

23:52.844 --> 23:54.176
I don't understand.

23:54.177 --> 23:56.410
It's a phrase we came up with

23:56.411 --> 23:59.500
to let one of us know
if the other was discovered.

23:59.610 --> 24:02.110
To warn them to stay away.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.443
He's with Geiger now.

24:53.673 --> 24:57.331
Jack, I know you are disloyal.

24:57.439 --> 24:59.672
I know your daughter is, too.

24:59.673 --> 25:01.305
Both your files...

25:01.306 --> 25:02.837
There were so many red flags,

25:02.838 --> 25:05.338
I thought I was
in a Russian airport.

25:05.905 --> 25:12.132
What I don't know is
where your loyalties lie.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.194
Where are your loyalties, Jack?

25:20.771 --> 25:23.271
So, who are you working for?

25:29.003 --> 25:31.503
We've met before, you and I.

25:33.037 --> 25:35.729
I'm surprised you don't recall.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.596
A man with such
attention to detail.

25:41.535 --> 25:43.701
I can't quite place it.

25:43.702 --> 25:46.202
Neither could I.

25:46.835 --> 25:49.335
But then I remembered.

25:49.368 --> 25:51.868
Kanagawa, '87.

25:54.068 --> 25:56.467
Were you with Nagayo?

25:56.468 --> 25:58.301
We had dinner.

25:58.302 --> 26:01.233
Oh, yes, I remember.

26:01.367 --> 26:02.767
What a night that was.

26:02.768 --> 26:05.268
The woman with the club foot.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.100
That's right.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.965
Come on, Jack.

26:16.966 --> 26:19.265
Just tell me
who you're working for,

26:19.266 --> 26:21.787
and this will all go away.

26:32.332 --> 26:34.832
One last chance.

26:57.530 --> 26:58.995
I don't understand.
Go where?

26:58.996 --> 27:01.129
Anywhere. Get Francie
and leave town.

27:01.130 --> 27:02.495
Vegas. San Francisco.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.595
What kind of trouble are you in?

27:04.596 --> 27:06.828
Someone might be looking for me.

27:06.829 --> 27:10.123
Promise me you will stay away.
That's all I need you to do.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.785
I promise. Syd, are you
gonna be okay?

27:12.895 --> 27:15.395
Yeah. I have to go.

27:16.395 --> 27:17.727
Kendall's on his way.

27:17.728 --> 27:20.228
He's not gonna do a thing.
My dad was right.

27:20.261 --> 27:22.761
Kendall's not gonna move
until he knows

27:22.795 --> 27:24.794
that information is valid.

27:24.795 --> 27:27.160
We have to get
that code from SD-6.

27:27.161 --> 27:29.661
You cannot go back there.

27:29.761 --> 27:32.261
I know.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.793
Sydney, I got your message.

27:50.393 --> 27:53.619
There isn't time for me
to explain everything.

27:55.892 --> 27:58.754
For me to apologize
the way I need to.

28:01.792 --> 28:05.518
SD-6 has nothing to do
with the CIA.

28:06.824 --> 28:09.345
Dixon, you've been lied to.

28:09.491 --> 28:12.149
We have all been lied to.

28:13.690 --> 28:15.922
What are you...
That's...

28:15.923 --> 28:17.922
You have had
suspicions about me.

28:17.923 --> 28:20.979
You had suspicions about me.
You were right.

28:21.090 --> 28:24.351
I know this is insane,
but you have to trust me now.

28:24.456 --> 28:27.909
I could take you to CIA,
show you the files, the proof.

28:28.023 --> 28:31.112
SD-6 is part of The Alliance.

28:31.222 --> 28:33.289
You have been working
for the enemy

28:33.290 --> 28:35.421
you thought you were fighting.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.012
This will take time
to understand.

28:38.156 --> 28:40.656
Time we don't have.

28:41.722 --> 28:44.222
I need you to listen to me.

28:48.955 --> 28:51.455
They have my dad.

28:52.621 --> 28:54.786
Geiger at SD-6.

28:54.787 --> 28:57.287
I'm afraid he's gonna kill him.

29:01.754 --> 29:04.446
The CIA.
The real CIA...

29:04.553 --> 29:08.143
No, no! This is crazy, Sydney!
Do you hear yourself?

29:08.253 --> 29:11.013
...has intel that can
change all of this.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.620
- You have to listen!
- This does not make sense!

29:13.719 --> 29:15.184
You have to listen to me!

29:15.185 --> 29:17.741
I can't go back there,
or they will kill me.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.818
We need you to go into SD-6.

29:19.819 --> 29:23.477
We need you to hack into the
system and make visible a file

29:23.585 --> 29:25.550
that you would
never know was there.

29:25.551 --> 29:27.951
It's a code.
A number that we need.

29:27.952 --> 29:30.183
If it's a match
to one we already have,

29:30.184 --> 29:32.051
it will confirm data,

29:32.052 --> 29:36.177
and the CIA will raid SD-6
and every Alliance office.

29:37.251 --> 29:40.512
If you follow these
instructions to get the code,

29:40.617 --> 29:46.549
you will be in the core
of SD-6 computer network.

29:48.584 --> 29:51.084
You'll see.

29:51.950 --> 29:54.248
It's not CIA.

29:54.249 --> 29:56.749
It's Alliance.

30:04.282 --> 30:06.247
I'll wait for your e-mail.

30:06.248 --> 30:08.748
But you need to hurry.

31:56.306 --> 31:57.972
Hello?
- Hi, baby.

31:57.973 --> 31:59.839
Where are you?

31:59.840 --> 32:01.504
I'm at work.

32:01.505 --> 32:03.839
What's up?

32:03.840 --> 32:08.272
I was just calling you

32:08.405 --> 32:11.029
to tell you I love you.

32:12.338 --> 32:14.005
How much I love you.

32:14.006 --> 32:16.562
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
I love you, too.

32:16.672 --> 32:19.172
When will you be home?

32:21.437 --> 32:23.603
I'm not sure.

32:23.604 --> 32:26.728
Okay. Well, be safe.

32:28.771 --> 32:31.271
You too.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.697
The code's a match.
It's a match!

33:10.867 --> 33:13.956
As you may be aware,
the CIA received intelligence

33:14.067 --> 33:17.623
which provides us with vital,
previously unavailable details

33:17.733 --> 33:20.289
on the inner workings
of The Alliance.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.956
Thanks to some exceptional work,
we've confirmed this intel.

33:24.066 --> 33:26.622
Therefore,
tonight at 2200 hours,

33:26.733 --> 33:29.254
the CIA, in conjunction
with the FSB,

33:29.366 --> 33:31.990
the BAP, MI5,
and the Shin Bet,

33:32.100 --> 33:35.997
will conduct simultaneous raids
on all Alliance facilities.

33:36.099 --> 33:39.257
And tomorrow morning,
God willing,

33:39.399 --> 33:42.228
The Alliance
will no longer exist.

33:49.364 --> 33:52.385
Our team will surround
the Credit Dauphine building

33:52.498 --> 33:54.830
which houses
the target SD-6 office.

33:54.831 --> 33:58.455
Team will get to the perimeter
and disable security systems.

33:58.564 --> 34:00.596
On operation leader's call,

34:00.597 --> 34:04.550
teams around the globe
will raid all SD offices,

34:04.663 --> 34:07.355
Alliance headquarters,
and partners' residences.

34:07.464 --> 34:10.792
Now, most SD-6 agents are
desk-trained and won't fight.

34:10.896 --> 34:14.793
But their security team members
will respond with lethal force.

34:14.895 --> 34:17.553
And they're the ones
you want to take down.

34:18.594 --> 34:20.728
People, it's a hazardous job.

34:20.728 --> 34:24.659
Do it well, and come home.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.259
Jack...

34:51.260 --> 34:53.781
You know how this goes.

34:53.926 --> 34:57.982
Your heart can only take
one more shock.

34:58.092 --> 35:00.258
Perhaps two.

35:00.259 --> 35:04.485
I've never seen anyone
go beyond three.

35:04.591 --> 35:06.824
Have you?

35:06.825 --> 35:09.325
Now! Move out!

35:18.190 --> 35:20.711
Base to team leader.
Security disarmed at SD-3.

35:20.824 --> 35:24.721
- All transmissions are received.
- Alarms disabled at SD-10.

35:24.824 --> 35:26.190
Base to team leader.

35:26.191 --> 35:28.815
Confirming security alarms
disarmed at SD-4.

35:37.223 --> 35:40.847
I have given you
enough time to reconsider.

35:52.655 --> 35:54.821
- You okay?
- Yeah.

35:54.822 --> 35:57.220
- SD-5 team, stand by.
- SD-4 team, stand by.

35:57.221 --> 35:59.721
SD-3 team, stand by.

36:03.853 --> 36:06.784
sir, all teams in position.

36:09.586 --> 36:11.919
Let's move in.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.420
Go, go, go.

36:20.685 --> 36:24.638
Hey, you want some
pigs in a blanket?

36:24.752 --> 36:26.284
- No. Thanks.
- What?

36:26.285 --> 36:28.785
Nobody can resist
little pigs in a blanket.

36:28.852 --> 36:31.352
They're hot,
fresh out of the oven.

36:33.218 --> 36:35.718
Everything all right?

36:35.884 --> 36:38.384
Yeah.

36:52.150 --> 36:54.650
Look out!

36:59.749 --> 37:02.249
Marshall, get down!

37:36.146 --> 37:39.304
Your daughter is so beautiful.

37:41.113 --> 37:43.839
Imagine what I could do to her.

38:07.877 --> 38:12.171
This is your last chance, Jack.

38:12.310 --> 38:14.810
Save yourself.

38:15.776 --> 38:18.276
Save Sydney.

38:19.943 --> 38:22.443
Who are you working for?

38:23.610 --> 38:26.110
Hmm?

38:52.707 --> 38:55.728
- Oh, my God, Dad.
- I'm okay, sweetheart. I'm okay.

38:59.474 --> 39:02.132
We have two men down at SD-4.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.206
Three agents killed at SD-8.

39:04.207 --> 39:07.570
- Three agents down at SD-2.
- SD-9 has four down.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.840
Miss Bristow, excuse me.
I got it.

39:15.073 --> 39:17.573
Give me your hand!

39:20.938 --> 39:23.438
Watch your step, ma'am.

39:23.738 --> 39:26.171
- Get up!
- On your feet.

39:26.172 --> 39:28.672
Dixon...

39:49.503 --> 39:52.729
Look, this will be
over soon. I promise.

39:55.202 --> 39:57.702
Thank you.

39:57.935 --> 40:00.627
Don't talk to me.

40:03.169 --> 40:05.467
Details of casualties
are still sketchy,

40:05.468 --> 40:07.801
but we've gotten reports
from team leaders.

40:07.802 --> 40:11.324
We appear to be in control
of all Alliance facilities.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.395
Hey, guys.
I just talked to base.

41:07.396 --> 41:09.896
We did it.
We kicked their asses.

41:10.230 --> 41:12.529
Hey.

41:12.530 --> 41:14.429
Guys, did you hear what I said?

41:14.430 --> 41:16.930
Asses...

41:17.230 --> 41:19.730
...kicked.

41:27.862 --> 41:30.588
It's remarkable, really.

41:30.728 --> 41:32.728
Sydney leaked the intel
to the CIA,

41:32.729 --> 41:35.955
and the rest played out exactly
as you predicted it would.

41:36.062 --> 41:38.060
So congratulations, sir.

41:38.061 --> 41:40.787
The Alliance is gone.

41:43.228 --> 41:45.359
We shouldn't celebrate yet.

41:45.360 --> 41:47.950
As you know, there's
much more work to be done.

41:48.060 --> 41:51.456
I just wanted to let you know
that phase one is complete.

41:51.559 --> 41:53.059
Good.

41:53.060 --> 41:55.560
Move on to phase two.

41:56.060 --> 41:57.725
And, Sark...

41:57.726 --> 41:59.658
Yes, Mr. Sloane?

41:59.659 --> 42:02.159
Check in on our new asset.

42:03.459 --> 42:05.959
Make sure we're on schedule.

42:26.856 --> 42:29.123
Yes?

42:29.124 --> 42:32.452
I've been asked to confirm
that you are in position.

42:34.190 --> 42:35.856
Yes.

42:35.857 --> 42:38.357
Everything's in place.
