00:06.758 --> 00:07.759
What the heck was that?

00:07.884 --> 00:09.218
- Cockroaches?
- Mice?

00:09.343 --> 00:10.762
Water buffalo?

00:11.888 --> 00:13.578
Do not judge,

00:13.579 --> 00:15.266
it was a real problem

00:11.888 --> 00:15.266
in my village.

00:15.892 --> 00:17.727
- How did you
- get rid of them?

00:17.852 --> 00:20.688
Really big glue traps.

They made the children

00:25.674 --> 00:26.903
chase them away

00:24.442 --> 00:26.903
for P.E. credit.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.073
Yo, kids.

00:30.074 --> 00:31.323
What do you think?

00:32.909 --> 00:34.515
It's a step up from

00:34.516 --> 00:36.120
what you usually wear.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.914
I'm dressed in character

00:37.915 --> 00:39.582
for an open-call audition

00:36.245 --> 00:39.582
for Brooklyn Vice.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.251
If this is what the

00:41.252 --> 00:42.794
girls wear in Brooklyn,

00:39.707 --> 00:42.794
can we move there?

00:44.336 --> 00:45.838
Fine. If you

00:45.839 --> 00:47.339
can spell Brooklyn,

00:44.336 --> 00:47.339
we'll move there.

00:47.465 --> 00:48.779
On second thought,

00:48.780 --> 00:50.092
how do girls

00:47.465 --> 00:50.092
dress in Soho?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.693
- Jessie, since when
- are you an actress?

00:53.721 --> 00:55.494
Well, I talked my way

00:55.495 --> 00:57.266
into this job, didn't I?

00:57.391 --> 00:59.122
And I think we all know

00:59.123 --> 01:00.853
I'm not really qualified

00:57.391 --> 01:00.853
to be a nanny.

01:00.979 --> 01:02.647
- Definitely not.
- I know, right?

01:02.772 --> 01:05.900
We still can't believe it.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.319
Okay, okay, that'll do!

01:08.444 --> 01:09.634
All right. I have to

01:09.635 --> 01:10.822
go pick up Zuri

01:08.444 --> 01:10.822
before my audition.

01:10.947 --> 01:12.490
Emma, you're in charge.

01:12.615 --> 01:13.741
And you cannot

01:13.742 --> 01:14.867
force the boys to

01:12.615 --> 01:14.867
have beauty treatments.

01:15.827 --> 01:18.704
Thank you!

01:18.830 --> 01:20.499
Last time,

01:20.500 --> 01:22.166
you waxed off

01:18.830 --> 01:22.166
my only chest hair!

01:22.834 --> 01:24.919
I still miss him.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.924
- There's that
- weird noise again.

01:30.049 --> 01:31.300
I bet it's a giant rat!

01:31.425 --> 01:32.822
New York's

01:32.823 --> 01:34.219
crawling with rats

01:31.425 --> 01:34.219
big as Labradoodles.

01:34.345 --> 01:37.389
Ooh, I love Labradoodles!

01:37.515 --> 01:39.493
- You wouldn't love them - if
they climbed up - The sewer pipes

01:39.517 --> 01:40.539
Into the toilet

01:40.540 --> 01:41.560
and bit your butt off!

01:41.686 --> 01:43.479
I would if

01:43.480 --> 01:45.272
they were wearing

01:41.686 --> 01:45.272
cute little bows.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.524
I do not think

01:46.525 --> 01:47.650
a rat could suddenly

01:45.397 --> 01:47.650
appear in a toilet.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.569
Believe it. Just ask

01:49.570 --> 01:51.362

01:47.775 --> 01:51.362

03:00.306 --> 03:01.306
in the dumbwaiter?

No! The dumbwaiter

03:15.511 --> 03:16.948
this is a good idea.

- what you think.

03:18.741 --> 03:19.888
We are men.

03:19.889 --> 03:21.035
We must explore!

03:22.536 --> 03:23.704

03:23.829 --> 03:25.515
- Where would we be
- if Christopher Columbus'

Babysitter had

03:27.209 --> 03:28.876
told him not to go

03:25.539 --> 03:28.876

you'll be able to say

04:03.995 --> 04:06.371
you knew me when.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.728
You mean

04:07.729 --> 04:08.958
when we had to

04:06.497 --> 04:08.958
stand in line forever

04:09.083 --> 04:10.919
and there was

04:10.920 --> 04:12.753
no rollercoaster

04:09.083 --> 04:12.753
at the end of it?

04:12.878 --> 04:13.984
How can you be bored?

04:13.985 --> 04:15.089
It's showbiz!

04:16.423 --> 04:18.091
- We might see
- Johnny Depp!

04:18.216 --> 04:19.385
Or we could just

04:19.386 --> 04:20.552
wait for Thanksgiving.

04:20.678 --> 04:21.887
Johnny Depp

04:21.889 --> 04:23.097
is my godfather.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.496
And every year

04:25.497 --> 04:27.768
he buries some treasure

04:23.222 --> 04:27.768
in the stuffing.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.334
- I wouldn't mind - getting my hands
- On that pirate's booty.

- be an actress,

04:33.691 --> 04:34.880
Why don't you

04:34.881 --> 04:36.068
just have my dad

04:33.691 --> 04:36.068
cast you in something?

04:36.194 --> 04:37.528
- Because
- when I make it big,

04:37.653 --> 04:39.405
I want it to be

04:39.406 --> 04:41.157
because of my talent

04:37.653 --> 04:41.157
and hard work.

04:41.365 --> 04:42.679
Plus,

04:42.680 --> 04:43.993
I already asked him

04:41.365 --> 04:43.993
and he said no.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.553
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

Very important

04:46.746 --> 04:47.913

04:45.577 --> 04:47.913

- to be at the
- front of this line.

- Hey! I'm trying out - for the part of the
- Medical examiner.

04:54.045 --> 04:55.359
Why not for

04:55.360 --> 04:56.672
the part of the cop?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.111
I don't think

04:58.112 --> 04:59.424
I could pull that off.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.572
Well, as long as

05:00.573 --> 05:01.593
we're both here waiting,

05:01.719 --> 05:03.738
- you want to - warm up with
- Some acting exercises?

05:03.762 --> 05:04.762
- Sure.
- Okay.

- up there long enough.

05:18.694 --> 05:19.945
I'm bringing him down!

05:20.071 --> 05:21.697
I'm sure he's fine.

05:24.075 --> 05:25.910
- Well, then again
- until recently I was sure

The capital of

05:27.433 --> 05:28.829
the United States

05:26.035 --> 05:28.829
was Gotham City, so.

Oh, no!

05:31.916 --> 05:32.958
Jessie left me in charge

05:33.084 --> 05:35.002
- and I just lost
- 50% of my brothers!

05:37.880 --> 05:39.090
- Ravi!
- Can you hear me?

05:39.215 --> 05:40.862
RAVI: Yes, but I do not

05:40.863 --> 05:42.509
know where I am!

05:43.427 --> 05:44.469
Whoa.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.430
- Maybe Ravi's passed
- through some portal

05:46.513 --> 05:48.537
And he's

05:48.538 --> 05:50.559
communicating with us

05:46.513 --> 05:50.559
from another dimension!

05:50.684 --> 05:52.353

05:52.354 --> 05:54.021

06:25.052 --> 06:26.571

- actually hugging.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.862
We believe it.

06:43.863 --> 06:45.197
Did you bring a headshot?

06:45.323 --> 06:47.084
- Well, no, no. No,
- I don't have headshots.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.202
But I did bring

06:49.203 --> 06:51.287
this cute caricature of

06:47.116 --> 06:51.287
me flying a bi-plane.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.327
- My head's not - really that big
- In real life, see?

07:00.504 --> 07:02.068
That's usually

07:02.069 --> 07:03.632

Thank you! This is

07:44.153 --> 07:45.549
a dream come true!

07:45.674 --> 07:47.217
Jessie, I was over

07:47.218 --> 07:48.760
at the snack table

07:48.886 --> 07:50.721
- and I saw
- some stupid clown

07:50.846 --> 07:52.286
Take the last 10 packs

07:52.287 --> 07:53.724
of Cutie Fruities!

07:53.849 --> 07:55.456
What kind of

07:55.457 --> 07:57.061
sick, cruel world

07:53.849 --> 07:57.061
are we living in?

07:57.186 --> 08:02.566
I want to go home!

08:02.649 --> 08:03.922
Wow. That emotion

08:03.923 --> 08:05.194
was so authentic.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.570
I could see your pain.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.696
You get between me

08:07.697 --> 08:08.780
and my Cutie Fruities,

08:08.906 --> 08:10.303
and it'll be the

08:10.304 --> 08:11.700
last thing you see.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.118
- I wanted
- a kid for this part,

08:13.244 --> 08:14.554
- But I couldn't find a child
- who was good enough.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.080
But you have

08:16.081 --> 08:17.581
really got something.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.770
That's what I keep

08:18.771 --> 08:19.917
telling people!

08:20.042 --> 08:22.753
Hello! Moneymaker!

08:24.713 --> 08:26.153
What?

08:26.154 --> 08:27.591
I thought you were

08:24.713 --> 08:27.591
bored with all of this.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.156
That was before

08:29.157 --> 08:30.594
my "something"

08:27.716 --> 08:30.594
was recognized.

08:31.429 --> 08:32.989
- Would you like - to play the part of
- The victim's daughter?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.827
(GASPS)

08:34.828 --> 08:36.640
Does Chubby the Bear

08:33.013 --> 08:36.640
poop in the woods?

08:36.767 --> 08:37.808
I don't know.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.061
Yes!

08:39.062 --> 08:40.187
Great.

08:40.312 --> 08:41.355
See you on set later.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.941
Wait, wait, wait!

08:42.942 --> 08:44.400
Wait, remember me?

08:44.608 --> 08:45.943
"Didn't stink?"

08:46.068 --> 08:47.487
Can't talk!

08:47.488 --> 08:48.904
Gotta beat the extras

08:46.068 --> 08:48.904
to the tri-tip!

08:53.617 --> 08:56.745
Ravi? Ravi?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.789
Luke, this is no time

08:58.790 --> 09:00.707
to dress up like a

08:56.870 --> 09:00.707
Jungle Cruise tour guide!

09:02.376 --> 09:05.379
I'm Indiana Jones!

09:05.504 --> 09:07.569
Okay, things that

09:07.570 --> 09:09.633
would be useful in

09:05.504 --> 09:09.633
a dark, dirty crawl space,

09:09.716 --> 09:11.469
flashlight and gloves.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.835
- Things that are
- not useful,

09:12.886 --> 09:14.513
- Jaunty hat
- and whippy thingy!

09:14.888 --> 09:16.265
(LOUD RATTLING)

09:16.266 --> 09:17.641
(SQUEAKING)

09:19.643 --> 09:20.978
Wrong.

09:20.979 --> 09:22.313
There's nothing

09:19.643 --> 09:22.313
a giant rat fears more

09:22.438 --> 09:23.711
than a man

09:23.712 --> 09:24.982
dressed for adventure

09:22.438 --> 09:24.982
with a whippy thingy.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.045
- Okay. - Just bring Ravi back
- Before Jessie gets home.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.904
Okay.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.239
- Before I get
- home and what?

09:32.364 --> 09:33.532
Ravi's in the bathroom!

09:33.533 --> 09:34.699
Jessie! You're here!

09:36.285 --> 09:37.286
And you guys are there.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.455
Glad we got

09:38.456 --> 09:39.497
roll-call out of the way.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.312
So, how did

09:42.313 --> 09:43.667
your audition go?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.419
Swell, for Zuri!

09:45.544 --> 09:46.896
- She got my part
- and shattered my dream.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.964
That is so great for Zuri!

09:51.925 --> 09:54.512
Oh, look, a corner.

09:55.513 --> 09:56.513
I will go stand in it.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.766
Great idea.

10:02.353 --> 10:03.812
- And now,
- if you'll excuse me,

10:03.937 --> 10:05.293
I have to go serve Zuri

10:05.294 --> 10:06.648
and her acting coach.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.150
Suddenly I'm a waitress.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.901
- Like every other
- actor in New York.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.597
- Apparently
- not a very good one.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.662
If I don't make it back,

10:20.787 --> 10:21.851
make sure Jessie

10:21.852 --> 10:22.914
never gets married.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.563
Have you seen the way

10:25.564 --> 10:26.918
she eats nachos?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.681
- I'm pretty sure
- that's not gonna happen.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.842
Now, vocal exercises.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.677
(VOCALIZING)

10:40.432 --> 10:41.933
Now your turn, Zuri.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.688
I don't think so.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.086
Just stick

10:48.087 --> 10:49.358
to teaching me

10:46.813 --> 10:49.358
about crime stuff.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.942
- I wouldn't think
- you'd need that.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.549
Stealing my dreams

10:52.550 --> 10:54.029
seemed to come

10:51.068 --> 10:54.029
so easily to you.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.511
You know,

10:56.512 --> 10:58.867
even though Officer Petey

10:54.154 --> 10:58.867
didn't get a part,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.036
he's not all bitter,

11:00.037 --> 11:01.078
like some people.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.600
(LAUGHS)

11:02.601 --> 11:03.997
I know, right?

11:05.374 --> 11:07.251
(WHISPERS) Sorry.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.587
Jessie, part of being

11:10.588 --> 11:13.798
a professional actor is

11:07.376 --> 11:13.798
doing research for a role.

11:13.924 --> 11:16.114
I take my craft

11:16.115 --> 11:18.303
very seriously.

11:18.429 --> 11:20.118
Just this morning,

11:20.119 --> 11:21.806
your craft was making

11:18.429 --> 11:21.806
bracelets out of paper clips.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.412
- You've never - said you wanted
- To be an actor.

11:25.436 --> 11:26.479
But I think

11:26.480 --> 11:27.521
I've been pretty clear

11:27.646 --> 11:28.814
that I like being

11:28.815 --> 11:29.981
the center of attention.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.278
Continue.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.779
Okay, well at

11:35.780 --> 11:37.155
some crime scenes,

11:37.281 --> 11:38.449
witnesses can be

11:38.450 --> 11:39.617
rattled by all the blood!

11:39.783 --> 11:40.576
Now check out this pic.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.620
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No. No.

11:42.786 --> 11:43.787
No, I don't think

11:43.788 --> 11:44.788
we want Zuri

11:42.786 --> 11:44.788
knowing about

11:44.871 --> 11:45.977
multiple stab wounds until

11:45.978 --> 11:47.082
at least the third grade.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.065
Ooh! Speaking of

11:50.066 --> 11:51.086
multiple stab wounds,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.089
have you guys

11:53.090 --> 11:54.965
seen a bloody knife in

11:51.211 --> 11:54.965
a plastic bag around here?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.801
Says "Exhibit A" on it.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.595
- No.
- Sorry.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.281
- Uh-oh. I must've
- left it in the diner.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.848
I hope they don't put it

12:02.849 --> 12:04.391
through the dishwasher!

12:04.516 --> 12:05.934
Gotta go!

12:06.059 --> 12:07.227
Keep practicing, Zuri!

12:08.812 --> 12:11.189
(VOCALIZING)

12:11.315 --> 12:13.401
Jessie, please

12:13.402 --> 12:15.486
bring my sandwich

12:11.315 --> 12:15.486
up to my dressing room.

12:16.654 --> 12:18.363
- You mean
- your room room?

12:18.489 --> 12:21.032
I dress in there, don't I?

12:22.826 --> 12:24.703
- And don't forget
- to cut off the crusts.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.247
Will do.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.603
After the crusts,

12:28.604 --> 12:29.833
I'm coming after

12:27.372 --> 12:29.833
your pigtails.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.587
RAVI: Get a grip, Ravi.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.943
You simply got lost in

12:34.944 --> 12:36.173
the walls of your apartment.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.845
(BOTH SCREAMING)

12:44.097 --> 12:45.391
Luke!

12:45.392 --> 12:46.684
You have found me.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.186
And in style.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.273
Now, which way out?

12:53.398 --> 12:54.566
I'm not sure.

12:54.692 --> 12:56.172
- I left a trail of
- chocolate chips,

12:56.234 --> 12:58.129
- But then I got hungry - and went back
- And ate them.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.134
Perhaps next time,

13:00.135 --> 13:02.115
you should leave a trail

12:58.153 --> 13:02.115
of Brussels sprouts.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.101
- So, other than being
- trapped in the walls

13:12.125 --> 13:14.170
And chased by

13:14.171 --> 13:16.213
a carnivorous rat,

13:12.125 --> 13:16.213
what else is new?

13:16.338 --> 13:17.735
Well, obsessing on

13:17.736 --> 13:19.132
the carnivorous rat

13:19.257 --> 13:20.405
is taking up

13:20.406 --> 13:21.552
most of my time

13:19.257 --> 13:21.552
these days.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.617
Did you get

13:24.618 --> 13:25.972
a good look at it?

13:26.097 --> 13:27.537
Well, in the

13:27.538 --> 13:28.975
split second before

13:26.097 --> 13:28.975
I went blind with fear,

13:29.100 --> 13:30.268
I saw a huge beast

13:30.269 --> 13:31.436
covered in gray fur.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.402
- (GASPS) Maybe Bertram's
- back from vacation.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.113
(CRUNCHING)

13:42.239 --> 13:43.261
Do you hear a strange

13:43.262 --> 13:44.282
crunching sound?

13:44.408 --> 13:46.097
Yes. I was hoping

13:46.098 --> 13:47.786
you brought potato chips.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.645
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

13:52.646 --> 13:55.126
It's just a big

13:50.163 --> 13:55.126
pile of bones.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.128
(BOTH SCREAMING)

13:57.254 --> 13:59.214
Bones!

13:59.339 --> 14:00.570
I have never been

14:00.571 --> 14:01.800
so scared in my life!

14:03.301 --> 14:04.366
Well, that record

14:04.367 --> 14:05.429
did not last long.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.724
Ravi? Luke?

14:08.932 --> 14:09.933
Emma?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.331
(THUDS)

14:11.332 --> 14:12.603
Ow.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.939
What you doin'?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.108
Um, degreasing the stove hood.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.529
That's a thing, right?

14:22.654 --> 14:24.131
- It's important we do
- chores once in a while.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.740
Otherwise, we could

14:25.741 --> 14:27.325
become spoiled brats.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.246
Jessie,

14:30.247 --> 14:31.955
alphabetize my candy.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.937
My bubblegum is

14:33.938 --> 14:35.793
touching my Zabbadabbas.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.817
Zuri, that is not

14:39.818 --> 14:41.381
how we ask for things.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.048
What's the magic word?

14:42.173 --> 14:43.967
Abracadabra?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.991
What does that have

14:46.992 --> 14:49.973
to do with me not

14:44.008 --> 14:49.973
having candy in my mouth?

14:50.098 --> 14:52.038
Someone else

14:52.039 --> 14:53.977
could use a little

14:50.098 --> 14:53.977
stove-cleaning duty.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.751
Emma, could you remind

14:56.752 --> 14:59.441
my personal assistant

14:54.060 --> 14:59.441
not to look directly at me?

15:06.156 --> 15:07.699
Zuri?

15:07.825 --> 15:09.494
Maybe on set,

15:09.495 --> 15:11.161
you should call me

15:07.825 --> 15:11.161
"Miss Ross."

15:12.663 --> 15:13.915
I've got a few ideas

15:13.916 --> 15:15.165
what to call you.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.521
Okay. I brought

15:16.522 --> 15:17.751
the stuff you asked for.

15:17.876 --> 15:18.877
Stanislavsky's essay

15:18.878 --> 15:19.878
on sense memory,

15:20.003 --> 15:21.422
and a juice box with

15:21.423 --> 15:22.840
a purple bendy straw.

15:24.883 --> 15:25.884
You're a good

15:25.885 --> 15:26.885
little worker, Prescott.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.744
And I treat

15:31.745 --> 15:32.891
my people right.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.018
I talked to the director,

15:35.019 --> 15:37.020
and she's found

15:33.016 --> 15:37.020
a part for you.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.501
- Oh, thank you
- so much, Miss Ross!

15:42.818 --> 15:43.841
Being an extra

15:43.842 --> 15:44.862
is not a part.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.782
Hey, Jessie. Weird, huh?

15:48.907 --> 15:50.722
You're in a fake crowd

15:50.723 --> 15:52.536
watching fake cops,

15:52.661 --> 15:54.017
and I'm a real cop

15:54.018 --> 15:55.372
controlling a real crowd

15:55.497 --> 15:57.040
watching the fake crowd.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.063
It's like my head's all,

15:59.064 --> 16:01.044
"What's going on?"

16:03.881 --> 16:05.195
So you're doing

16:05.196 --> 16:06.508
crowd control?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.177
Yeah, because

16:08.178 --> 16:09.720
that guy snaked my part.

16:09.845 --> 16:12.472
Just 'cause he's

16:12.473 --> 16:15.099
"incredibly handsome"

16:09.845 --> 16:15.099
and "can act."

16:15.225 --> 16:16.935
I don't get it.

16:16.936 --> 16:18.645
Show business is

16:15.225 --> 16:18.645
supposed to be fair.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.252
Yeah. Well, I hope

16:20.253 --> 16:21.732
pretty-boy likes hanging

16:18.770 --> 16:21.732
around the park,

16:21.857 --> 16:23.025
'cause half an inch

16:23.026 --> 16:24.192
of his bumper

16:21.857 --> 16:24.192
was in the red zone

16:24.317 --> 16:25.998
- and now he's got
- five boots on his car.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.154
Five?

16:28.279 --> 16:31.074
Yeah, I got his spare, too.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.052
- Well, you know, - at least you're gonna
- Be on camera.

16:33.076 --> 16:33.785
That's a start.

16:33.911 --> 16:34.953
It is a start.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.598
- And I am gonna make
- the most of it.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.087
Oh, come on!

16:47.841 --> 16:49.802
So, Emma, Ravi

16:49.803 --> 16:51.762
gets lost in the walls,

16:51.887 --> 16:53.013
then I get

16:53.014 --> 16:54.138
lost in the walls,

16:54.264 --> 16:55.870
so your solution was

16:55.871 --> 16:57.475
get lost in the walls?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.561
- Can we please not have
- this conversation

16:59.686 --> 17:01.772
On a mountain of bones?

17:01.897 --> 17:03.503
If we leave, we might

17:03.504 --> 17:05.108
run into the thing

17:01.897 --> 17:05.108
that left them here.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.944
- And it'll add us
- to its collection.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.194
And I have

17:08.195 --> 17:09.279
a double-jointed elbow.

17:09.404 --> 17:10.404
It is highly collectible!

17:12.365 --> 17:13.951
(LOW GROWLING)

17:14.117 --> 17:15.993
(SCREAMING)

17:16.118 --> 17:18.121
The creature approaches!

17:18.246 --> 17:19.998
- Luke, kill it
- with your bullwhip!

17:21.249 --> 17:22.792
(WHIPPING)

17:23.542 --> 17:24.002
(SCREAMING)

17:24.127 --> 17:25.921
(WHIMPERING)

17:26.128 --> 17:27.422
My heroes.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.466
Wait a minute!

17:29.591 --> 17:30.905
I'd recognize

17:30.906 --> 17:32.218
that mouse breath anywhere.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.971
It's Mr. Kipling!

17:36.431 --> 17:38.475
Covered in dust, insulation,

17:38.476 --> 17:40.518
and a couple of socks.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.230
- This must be
- where Mr. Kipling comes

17:44.355 --> 17:45.837
To regurgitate

17:45.838 --> 17:47.317
the indigestible bones

17:44.355 --> 17:47.317
of his prey.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.653
Is that not adorable?

17:51.822 --> 17:53.573
(SQUEAKING)

17:53.698 --> 17:55.326
Hey! That's the

17:55.327 --> 17:56.952
squeaking noise

17:53.698 --> 17:56.952
we've been hearing!

17:57.160 --> 17:59.287
Aw, it is Marvin

17:59.288 --> 18:01.414
the Mongoose,

17:57.160 --> 18:01.414
Mr. Kipling's chew toy.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.374
Again, adorable.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.462
- Meanwhile,
- we're still lost.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.631
Follow me.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.512
So, do we follow

18:15.513 --> 18:17.597
the creature with a brain

18:13.426 --> 18:17.597
the size of a walnut?

18:17.722 --> 18:18.722
Or Mr. Kipling?

18:24.479 --> 18:26.397
DIRECTOR: And action!

18:26.523 --> 18:27.858
When we realized

18:27.859 --> 18:29.192
the clown was trying

18:26.523 --> 18:29.192
to mug us,

18:29.317 --> 18:30.986
we made a run for it.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.116
Cut! Quit trying

18:35.117 --> 18:37.200
to get in the shot!

18:37.283 --> 18:38.535
Yeah, people!

18:38.660 --> 18:39.995
Unprofessional!

18:41.579 --> 18:42.977
When we realized the clown

18:42.978 --> 18:44.374
was trying to mug us,

18:44.499 --> 18:45.917
we made a run for it.

18:47.085 --> 18:50.797
Cut! What are you doing?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.984
- You know, - I thought the clown
- Could have a sister

18:53.008 --> 18:54.031
Who's always bailing him

18:54.032 --> 18:55.052
out of trouble,

18:55.218 --> 18:57.338
- even though she has a deep,
- dark secret herself...

18:57.428 --> 18:58.639
That's it! You're fired!

18:58.640 --> 18:59.848
Get out of here!

18:59.973 --> 19:02.059
(SIGHS)

19:02.225 --> 19:03.247
Fine, I'll stay

19:03.248 --> 19:04.268
out of the shot,

19:02.225 --> 19:04.268
but I can't leave.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.729
I'm her nanny.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.206
- I hope you're - a better nanny than
- You are an actress.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.357
She sure is!

19:11.359 --> 19:13.319
I mean,

19:13.320 --> 19:15.279
she's the best nanny

19:11.359 --> 19:15.279
in the whole wide world.

19:15.405 --> 19:16.886
You see this? Okay.

19:16.887 --> 19:18.366
This is my "don't care" face.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.868
Now let's get

19:19.869 --> 19:21.244
back to the scene!

19:21.285 --> 19:22.558
If you don't rehire Jessie,

19:22.559 --> 19:23.830
the only scene

19:21.285 --> 19:23.830
you're gonna get

19:23.955 --> 19:25.645
is one of my

19:25.646 --> 19:27.333
Level Seven tantrums!

19:27.458 --> 19:29.377
- Uh, be careful.
- The last Level Seven

19:29.502 --> 19:31.046
Ended up with our couch

19:31.047 --> 19:32.589
in the downstairs

19:29.502 --> 19:32.589
neighbor's hot tub.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.675
Fine, you're fired too.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.862
- Wait, wait, wait. - No, no, no, no!
- You can't fire Zuri.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.012
This has been her dream

19:39.013 --> 19:40.138
since lunch.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.369
Security, get them

19:42.370 --> 19:43.474
out of here!

19:43.600 --> 19:44.935
And don't let the

19:44.936 --> 19:46.269
little one take

19:43.600 --> 19:46.269
any Cutie Fruities!

19:47.979 --> 19:49.480
(SIGHS)

19:51.357 --> 19:52.484
Zuri, I'm sorry

19:52.485 --> 19:53.610
you're not gonna be

19:51.357 --> 19:53.610
on Brooklyn Vice

19:53.735 --> 19:55.111
because of me.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.487
Oh, that's okay.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.449
That show always gets beat

19:58.450 --> 20:00.283
by Hip Hop Exterminator.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.452
I love that show!

20:02.577 --> 20:03.787
Especially Danger Mousetrap

20:03.788 --> 20:04.996
and Fitty Centipede.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.604
Anyway, thanks

20:08.605 --> 20:09.751
for sticking up for me.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.106
It kind of makes up

20:11.107 --> 20:12.336
for all the diva stuff

20:09.876 --> 20:12.336
you've been pulling.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.881
Diva? How was

20:13.882 --> 20:15.298
I being a diva?

20:15.423 --> 20:17.103
- I just want what I want
- when I want it.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.887
Oh. Now I hear it.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.557
Mmm-hmm.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.059
Now who am I going

20:26.060 --> 20:27.435
to get to play the part

20:24.682 --> 20:27.435
of the victim's daughter?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.228
Ooh, me! Me!

20:30.605 --> 20:32.774
Me.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.901
I play ages six

20:34.902 --> 20:36.903
to 26, male...

20:37.737 --> 20:38.737
Or female.

20:42.909 --> 20:43.910
Are we almost there?

20:43.911 --> 20:44.911
I do not know.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.704
Mr. Kipling has disappeared.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.352
It is like he fell

20:48.353 --> 20:49.874
off the face of the...

20:46.830 --> 20:49.874
(YELLING)

20:55.839 --> 20:57.132
(ALL GROANING)

20:57.256 --> 20:58.466
Ouch!

20:58.591 --> 20:59.968
What hideous netherworld

20:59.969 --> 21:01.344
have we fallen into now?

21:03.471 --> 21:04.471
Oh, it is my room!

21:06.183 --> 21:07.602
That was awesome!

21:07.603 --> 21:09.019
Let's do it again!

21:09.144 --> 21:10.385
- Do what again?
- ALL: Nothing.

21:12.689 --> 21:13.732
I've been looking

21:13.733 --> 21:14.774
for you guys everywhere.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.567
- What are you doing
- with Mr. Kipling?

21:16.693 --> 21:17.110
- Cleaning.
- Playing.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.154
Cuddling.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.364
All right, less cuddling

21:21.365 --> 21:23.366
more cleaning.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.052
- But, Emma, - great job taking care
- Of your brothers.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.411
You know,

21:26.412 --> 21:27.745
I'm going to put you

21:25.076 --> 21:27.745
in charge more often.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.247
- What did I
- ever do to you?

21:31.166 --> 21:32.709
(SOBBING)

21:33.793 --> 21:35.712
Okay.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.610
Why do I always feel

21:37.611 --> 21:39.382
there's something going on

21:35.837 --> 21:39.382
I don't know about?

21:39.423 --> 21:41.134
- Hey, I've been looking
- for that sock!

21:42.719 --> 21:44.054
Why is there a bone on it?

21:47.265 --> 21:48.371
I'm telling you,

21:48.372 --> 21:49.475
Officer Dunlap,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.144
my father was mugged

21:51.145 --> 21:52.687
by a clown.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.376
I only hope you

21:54.377 --> 21:55.940
can help me get to

21:52.812 --> 21:55.940
the bottom of this

21:56.983 --> 21:58.109
funny business.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.759
Now, please,

22:01.760 --> 22:03.990
let me go home!

22:05.867 --> 22:07.035
Whew!

22:07.160 --> 22:08.933
So, what do you think?

22:08.934 --> 22:10.705
And be honest.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.644
Well, I think

22:12.645 --> 22:14.458
you're a better actor

22:10.830 --> 22:14.458
than you are a cop.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.818
Thank you!

22:18.819 --> 22:20.423
And what did

22:17.212 --> 22:20.423
you think, Jessie?

22:22.175 --> 22:23.802
I thought you were

22:23.803 --> 22:25.428
really, really great.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.265
I know, right? Yeah!

22:28.431 --> 22:29.751
- Told you
- I was a good actress.
