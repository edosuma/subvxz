03:25.117 --> 03:27.207
Hi.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.122
I'm here.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.216
It's me...

03:36.738 --> 03:38.174
Fred.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.307
Hey, hello there.

03:42.874 --> 03:46.051
So, I'm here...

03:46.138 --> 03:48.053
with all my stuff.

03:48.140 --> 03:53.015
And I came here to--
Anyway, here I am with it.

03:53.929 --> 03:57.149
- I brought it all to your
place.
- I see that.

03:58.150 --> 04:01.066
- You can tell me to go if
you--
- No, that's not what I--

04:01.153 --> 04:04.069
- Surprise!
- Yes, it's quite the--

04:04.156 --> 04:09.118
So, is your plane not something?
Is it delayed? Or what? 'Cause I
don't get the--

04:11.033 --> 04:15.255
No, my plane's not... I mean,
I'm here to see you...

04:15.777 --> 04:19.824
and to see if maybe...

04:19.911 --> 04:23.088
we could figure something--

04:23.175 --> 04:26.222
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.964
You can't stand out on the
landing all day, so yeah, come
in.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.836
- I do have to go out soon,
though.
- Yeah, no, great.

04:31.923 --> 04:36.276
Look, I just didn't know how you
were gonna react, or, you know,
what--

04:36.798 --> 04:39.975
and I didn't wanna phone, but
then I though, yeah, I mean,
should I phone...

04:40.062 --> 04:45.110
how do you explain away fifty
years of a life over the phone,
right?

04:45.197 --> 04:49.245
I mean, I don't think I even
have a calling plan that'll
support that.

04:49.332 --> 04:53.118
It's a terrible joke. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Just a little
nervous.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.860
- Why?
- I don't know. I just am.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.994
Well, there's no reason to-- I
mean, we know each other, Fred,
we have for a long time.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.301
There's no reason for either of
us to feel bad about things at
all.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.999
No, I know. Yeah, I know that. I
don't, you know?

05:04.086 --> 05:07.132
I mean, but I didn't say bad. I
didn't say that.

05:07.219 --> 05:10.005
I said nervous.

05:10.092 --> 05:13.008
- Is that all right?
- Of course.

05:13.095 --> 05:17.012
However you want to feel is
fine. It's okay.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.231
Thanks.

05:27.979 --> 05:31.026
Are you going somewhere or what?
'Cause that is a lot of stuff
you got there.

05:31.113 --> 05:33.289
Oh, yeah, no, I...

05:33.376 --> 05:36.336
On the plane you can only carry
on two things, you know, two
bags.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.339
So those two, and then these two
I checked.

05:39.861 --> 05:43.299
And basically I had grabbed
everything from the house...

05:43.386 --> 05:45.954
that was mine and...

05:46.041 --> 05:49.305
well, not everything, but you
know what I mean.

05:49.392 --> 05:54.179
Anyway, I did it all when Miriam
was at the store.

05:54.266 --> 05:57.313
How 'bout that? What a coward.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.885
Twenty four years of being
married to the woman and that's
how I go about it.

06:06.409 --> 06:09.978
Oh, well, I make myself sick.

06:10.065 --> 06:13.895
Maybe you should call her.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.985
Who?

06:20.902 --> 06:23.121
Your wife.

06:23.208 --> 06:28.170
Yeah, no, I will. I mean, at
some point, definitely, I'll
call her.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.174
And Chris, what about him?

06:35.307 --> 06:38.354
- I don't know, what about him?
- Well, he's your son, for one
thing...

06:38.441 --> 06:40.443
so he's probably gonna want to
know what's up. I know I would.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.315
Yeah, well, probably so.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.319
- Can I get some water?
- Sure.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.368
I don't think he'll like it.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.981
True.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.114
But maybe he doesn't need to
know.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.334
Still.

07:38.501 --> 07:42.462
I suppose, in some strange way,
he's the one who introduced us,
though.

07:43.985 --> 07:49.469
- Fred.
- No, I'm just saying that you
know, kinda--

07:49.991 --> 07:52.036
I introduced us. It wasn't him.

07:52.123 --> 07:56.432
No, I know that. I know, I know.
But all I'm saying is that--

07:56.519 --> 07:59.348
It was me. I put the note in
your pocket. So it wasn't him.

07:59.435 --> 08:04.092
Yeah, I know, but if he had not
been seeing you, then...

08:04.179 --> 08:06.442
No, no, come on.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.705
What?

08:08.792 --> 08:11.491
No, look, I'm not saying that he
should be, you know, all happy
for me...

08:12.013 --> 08:14.102
and he'll understand and
everything, I'm not saying that.

08:14.189 --> 08:20.369
- I'm just telling you--
- He still sees me, Chris, from
time to time.

08:20.456 --> 08:23.503
We go for lunch, and so I'm not
sure he'll feel very--

08:24.025 --> 08:26.244
You know what I'm saying. You
know exactly.

08:31.032 --> 08:34.426
Lunch? Really?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.518
- With Wonderboy?
- Sometimes.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.216
Sometimes other things.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.096
Other things, huh?

08:52.575 --> 08:55.317
I didn't...

09:00.583 --> 09:05.066
He's married now, you know? Just
in case he didn't mention it.

09:06.589 --> 09:09.113
He did.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.073
Yes, he is.

09:17.208 --> 09:21.082
And he still... really?

09:28.219 --> 09:30.657
And does Mandy know? Mandy is
his wife.

09:30.744 --> 09:33.137
Yeah, I know.

09:33.224 --> 09:36.271
I guess not, but I'm not that
deep a part of his life.

09:36.358 --> 09:39.274
So I don't really know or care.

09:39.361 --> 09:44.148
Great. I just bet she doesn't.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.411
No, I guess the same. So go on.

09:48.239 --> 09:50.241
Take it.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.114
Thanks.

09:54.115 --> 09:56.596
I have this terrible dryness in
my mouth.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.295
It's so dry, it's like...

10:00.382 --> 10:05.213
This dryness is like hanging in
the back of my throat. Can't get
rid of it.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.564
Do you feel sick or anything?
Maybe you caught something
recently and it's just starting
to--

10:08.651 --> 10:12.437
No, that's not it. No. Thank
you, though.

10:16.311 --> 10:19.662
I think I'm gonna go outside and
get a little fresh air.

10:20.141 --> 10:23.623
Sure. Go ahead. I do have to get
ready in a minute, but...

10:24.145 --> 10:26.626
Yeah. You said that.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.620
So, you're going out?

11:04.707 --> 11:08.668
- I am this morning.
- Where to?

11:09.190 --> 11:14.195
You know, day off and... I don't
know, shopping?

11:16.240 --> 11:19.679
They're all really sort of days
off for you, though, aren't
they?

11:20.201 --> 11:23.683
Right? I mean, 'cause you don't
really have a proper, you know,
whatever.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.468
Not that I know about any of
that.

11:26.555 --> 11:30.733
No, I don't. No. Not a proper
one like you.

11:31.212 --> 11:34.215
We can't all be lawyers, right?

11:35.738 --> 11:38.349
There would be nobody left to
hate.

11:40.656 --> 11:43.485
So you're going out. You're
going shopping.

11:43.572 --> 11:48.446
Yeah. Something like that. You
know, seeing friends.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.275
Good.

11:51.362 --> 11:55.279
- But nothing specific or...?
- No, I didn't mean that.

11:55.366 --> 11:58.326
Yeah, somewhat specific. Lunch.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.894
Really?

12:00.981 --> 12:05.594
Yes. Believe it or not, Fred,
there are people who are
expecting to hear from me soon.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.685
I'm not calling you a liar. I
was simply asking a question.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.427
What about you? What about this?

12:12.514 --> 12:17.301
Yeah, I know, I know. I can't
even wrap my head around it.

12:17.388 --> 12:20.565
- It's wild.
- I know.

12:20.652 --> 12:23.438
It is and I just--

12:23.525 --> 12:25.701
Can you sit down?

12:25.788 --> 12:28.704
- No, Fred, we are--
- Please, just sit.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.752
- But I'm fine.
- Sit! Sit!

12:33.274 --> 12:35.624
I'm sorry, but it's very
uncomfortable you just standing
there.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.583
- It's like you're timing me or
something.
- I'm not, I promise.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.586
Sit down. I mean, I know, like,
rationally you're not.

12:41.673 --> 12:45.286
It just feels like you're, you
know, like...

12:46.548 --> 12:50.465
...just keeping me on edge.
That's all. Okay?

12:50.552 --> 12:53.729
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's fine.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.732
It just felt like you we're
trying to, you know...

12:56.819 --> 12:58.560
Thank you.

12:58.647 --> 13:02.346
I'm sitting. Now we can talk.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

13:02.433 --> 13:04.827
No, its fine, it's fine, it's
fine.

13:04.914 --> 13:08.483
It just felt like you were just
trying to push me out the door,
at least in your mind.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.791
I wasn't. I wouldn't do that.
I'm not that kind of person.

13:12.313 --> 13:18.623
I know that. I know that. I know
that. I know that now, and I'm
sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.756
You do keep checking you watch.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.410
Yeah, I just have somewhere to
be.

13:24.847 --> 13:27.807
You've made that very clear. You
were not expecting me. You've
made that very clear.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.374
I wasn't. It was a surprise.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.812
A good one, I would have hoped.

13:33.334 --> 13:36.380
Yeah, a shock even, but a good
one, yes.

13:36.467 --> 13:40.515
Yeah, really? A good one?

13:40.602 --> 13:44.388
Yes, a good one. It's nice to
see you.

13:44.475 --> 13:47.522
It's nice to see you, too. It's
been a while.

13:47.609 --> 13:50.830
- Yeah, years.
- I know.

13:51.352 --> 13:54.834
And I did what I said I would
do, didn't I?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.662
I stayed away.

13:57.749 --> 14:02.537
No matter how hard it was, and
it was particularly hard at the
beginning...

14:02.624 --> 14:05.757
when we had first broken it off,
but...

14:07.759 --> 14:11.546
I mean, I stayed away.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.375
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

14:15.898 --> 14:20.860
I kept my promise. I mean, there
were those e-mails and those
phone calls...

14:21.382 --> 14:25.690
and the birthday gift that I
sent you, that little iPod
thingy...

14:25.777 --> 14:28.563
with your name engraved on it...

14:28.650 --> 14:32.436
but really, for the most part...

14:32.523 --> 14:36.440
I did what I promised you I
would do, I stayed away.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.573
- Thank you.
- Sure.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.445
For being a gentleman.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.883
Well, I don't know about that...

14:44.405 --> 14:46.711
but I did what I said I would
do.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.671
- Thanks.
- For a long time.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.805
So.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.900
So, yeah.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.772
That's an understatement, right?

15:12.824 --> 15:17.438
Yeah, so, what the hell do I do
now?

15:20.789 --> 15:23.444
I mean, honestly, what?

15:24.445 --> 15:26.490
You're not seriously asking my
advice on this, are you?

15:26.577 --> 15:28.449
Kinda, yeah.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.714
I'm not really in a good
position to answer that, Fred.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.630
You just show up, your bags
scattered at your feet.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.981
I don't really have answers for
a puzzle like that one.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.593
I don't know what to say.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.292
Okay.

15:45.379 --> 15:49.905
- I'd like to help you, but I
can't.
- Yeah, no, I know. I'm not
expecting you to...

15:49.992 --> 15:54.649
help me get out of this mess
that I created for myself here.

15:54.736 --> 15:57.652
I wouldn't expect that of you.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.959
Good.

16:00.046 --> 16:05.573
I was just hoping you might
throw a few ideas my way, you
know, but...

16:05.660 --> 16:08.054
- I told you to call you wife.
- Gee, thanks.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.534
- Well?
- Well what?

16:10.621 --> 16:13.973
What good is that gonna do? Make
me say the words, "I left you"?

16:14.495 --> 16:18.542
I think she got it. The empty
closet should be a pretty strong
indication...

16:18.629 --> 16:21.023
that it wasn't like the rapture
or anything.

16:21.110 --> 16:25.636
Then maybe you should just do
what you want to do.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.987
I am. I'm here.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.511
I wanna be here.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.951
I mean, is that what you're
asking me? What is it that I
want to do exactly?

16:36.038 --> 16:40.825
Like if you're saying, "What is
it that exactly you want to do?
Where exactly do you want to
be?"

16:40.912 --> 16:44.699
Then that would be here with
you. Right now.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.049
That's why I'm here.

16:47.136 --> 16:52.924
I mean, and that's the first
time I've ever done that, put my
needs first.

16:54.535 --> 17:00.715
Right? I've always done the
right thing, the decent thing.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.934
I've never...

17:04.806 --> 17:07.374
- True?
- I'm not disagreeing.

17:07.461 --> 17:10.986
Yeah, but you're not exactly
waving a fucking flag in my
direction either, are you?

17:11.073 --> 17:13.728
I agree with you, Fred.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.859
- There you go, is that better?
- Yes, thanks.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.821
- Good.
- Don't say it if you don't mean
it.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.041
- I won't.
- Obviously not.

17:24.086 --> 17:27.611
No, I mean, if you don't feel
it, you know, don't say it.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.961
Don't say it to me. Just say it.
What?

17:30.049 --> 17:32.877
You're being a little bit pushy!
You're not pushy. No, that's the
wrong word.

17:32.964 --> 17:36.055
You're being a little bit, you
know, charged up about things.

17:36.577 --> 17:39.710
And it's a little bit unnerving.
Yeah, so just...

17:40.711 --> 17:42.844
Just let it be.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.021
I mean, come on.

17:46.108 --> 17:49.068
I'm not like the Beatles or
something.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.722
That's funny.

17:55.813 --> 17:59.730
All right, so anyway, what time
do you have to go?

17:59.817 --> 18:02.429
- No, I'm good on time.
- Take a shower, do what you
gotta do.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.040
I'm just gonna stay here. I'm
fine, I'll be all right.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.912
- No, Fred.
- What? No, go, go.

18:07.999 --> 18:11.046
I mean, go ahead. I've seen you
in a towel before, don't be
bashful.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.789
It's okay. It's all right. Go do
what you have to do.

18:14.876 --> 18:16.921
- I'm all right.
- No, really, I mean it.

18:17.008 --> 18:19.794
Go douche or whatever that, you
know, whatever.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.057
Fred...

18:22.144 --> 18:24.668
I'm fine, I said.

18:24.755 --> 18:28.803
I might throw on some different
clothes, but otherwise...

18:28.890 --> 18:32.763
Okay, fine. Yeah, no, good. I
mean, you ought to know, right?

18:33.895 --> 18:37.072
You ought to know your schedule
much better than anyone.
Particularly me.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.684
- Yeah.
- Even Chris, right?

18:40.771 --> 18:42.947
I should, yeah.

18:43.034 --> 18:48.083
How is old Chris doing anyway?
How's Wonderboy doing?

18:48.170 --> 18:52.696
He's good. The last time I saw
him, which was--

18:52.783 --> 18:55.830
- When?
- I was just about to say.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.920
- Okay, sorry.
- Fred, come on.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.489
Just relax. Everything is fine.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.144
It's okay.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.154
That feels good.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.766
Your hand there.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.815
Your touch.

19:40.701 --> 19:45.836
Okay, I'm glad, but I wasn't
trying to...

19:45.923 --> 19:49.013
I know. You were just trying to
comfort me, that's all.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.278
I know you weren't trying to get
all sexy or whatever, you know.
I'm not stupid.

19:52.365 --> 19:55.150
- I wasn't calling you
anything.
- It's fine.

19:55.237 --> 19:59.285
I knew it was what it was if it
was not filled with personal
history.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.200
I just wanted to be clear.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.028
I got it. Look, and I just
reacted to it, okay?

20:04.115 --> 20:08.032
When I feel a sensation, that's
the way I just react, whether
it's good or bad.

20:08.119 --> 20:11.035
I'm a reactive person. That's
the way I am. I have no...

20:11.122 --> 20:15.039
And I'm not gonna apologize for
that. Not to you, not to
anybody. So...

20:15.126 --> 20:19.000
Anyway, I don't want to talk
about this anymore because my
nerves are shot today...

20:19.087 --> 20:22.177
and I really want you to see me
at my best.

20:22.264 --> 20:26.877
I don't want you to, you know,
see me like some horrible,
like--

20:29.053 --> 20:31.839
It's fine. It's okay.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.320
No, it's actually not okay. It's
not.

20:34.407 --> 20:37.192
If it were okay, I would be
saying to you, "Hey, you know
what? This is okay."

20:37.279 --> 20:40.978
But actually this is not an okay
moment for me. Okay?

20:44.025 --> 20:47.028
That was me being funny, okay?

20:52.207 --> 20:54.862
Doesn't that feel good? It feels
good, actually...

20:54.949 --> 20:58.257
to get it all out in one big
rush of laughter like that.

21:02.913 --> 21:06.047
All right, I'm gonna go now.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.921
You didn't mean any of that, did
you?

21:11.008 --> 21:14.882
- No, not a word.
- I could tell.

21:17.188 --> 21:21.105
I don't know what I said to make
you so angry, Fred, but...

21:21.192 --> 21:24.152
- I'm not angry.
- You are, right now,
aggressive.

21:26.197 --> 21:29.070
Yeah, maybe a little aggressive.
Yeah, maybe a little.

21:29.157 --> 21:32.856
However it feels, it's coming
off of you in waves.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.642
Big tsunami waves of anger...

21:35.903 --> 21:40.124
and it's hitting me so hard in
the chest, I feel...

21:40.211 --> 21:42.953
I don't know, I feel...

21:46.957 --> 21:50.134
I feel ready to start crying,
just right now as I sit here.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.876
Just in case that's what you're
looking for.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.096
I'm just being honest.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.276
Sorry.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.844
That's not what I...

22:04.845 --> 22:07.326
That's not what I wanted. I'm
sorry.

22:08.239 --> 22:11.242
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.855
I'm sorry.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.119
I'm sorry.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.864
I really am sorry, Velvet.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.042
Don't do that.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.174
What?

22:30.261 --> 22:33.352
Velvet. Don't call me that.

22:33.874 --> 22:35.876
Really?

22:36.137 --> 22:37.704
Yeah. Why would I...?

22:40.184 --> 22:43.927
Why would I want you calling me
that now, years later, when I'm
not that girl anymore?

22:44.014 --> 22:46.147
Please respect that.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.934
- No.
- What's no?

22:51.021 --> 22:55.025
Well, because I don't
necessarily believe that's true.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.202
Excuse me?

22:58.289 --> 23:00.466
- Excuse me, Fred?
- What?

23:00.553 --> 23:02.206
How the fuck would you know what
I'm doing with my life unless
you're here...

23:02.293 --> 23:04.383
're me and
he day to day of what I'm doing?

23:04.905 --> 23:07.037
How do you have an answer for
that?

23:07.124 --> 23:09.213
- Because of what you said
before.
- What was that? What did I say?

23:09.300 --> 23:11.346
- About Chris.
- What?

23:11.433 --> 23:14.958
About Chris, my son, whom you
used to go out with...

23:15.045 --> 23:17.396
and who you now see privately.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.399
That's what made me believe it.
That little fact.

23:20.486 --> 23:24.228
- I said we go for lunch
sometimes.
- And then, "And sometimes other
stuff."

23:24.315 --> 23:27.101
- I didn't mean--
- But you said, "And sometimes
other stuff."

23:27.188 --> 23:30.974
- I didn't mean "that."
- You just said it two minutes
ago, Velvet.

23:31.061 --> 23:33.412
Stop calling me Velvet!

23:33.934 --> 23:37.416
All right! Okay! You stop! Stop
yelling at me!

23:37.938 --> 23:40.114
I'm yelling because you keep
calling me Velvet!

23:40.201 --> 23:43.117
All right! All right! So stop!
Fine! Just stop it!

23:43.204 --> 23:46.425
Stop it. I'm stopping because
this is ridiculous

23:46.947 --> 23:49.384
This is fucking ridiculous.

23:49.471 --> 23:52.126
That's not me, that's not who I
am.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.433
If you ask anyone in my life,
it's not anyone I associate
with.

23:54.955 --> 23:57.000
And if Chris were here, he
really would tell you the same
thing.

23:57.087 --> 23:59.263
Or anyone else that I'm seeing.

23:59.350 --> 24:02.266
Seeing? I love how you put it
like that.

24:02.353 --> 24:06.140
You make it sound so proper.
"Seeing. I'm seeing someone."

24:06.227 --> 24:08.403
- How many guys are you
"seeing"?
- No!

24:08.490 --> 24:11.362
Seeing as in go for a quick
drink with or whatever!

24:11.450 --> 24:14.278
I'm in a place in my life, Fred,
believe it or not, where I
actually have friends or
boyfriends...

24:14.365 --> 24:17.325
not serious boyfriends, but
that's cool with me.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.458
That's cool because that's what
I need right now, the space and
the freedom and the plain old
"me" time.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.461
The thing to do what I do, which
is my work and my school...

24:22.983 --> 24:25.464
and all the things I'm doing,
much like finding myself.

24:25.986 --> 24:29.032
And I know it sounds mystical
and bullshitty to you, but
that's not the fucking point.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.513
The point is that I'm not longer
called Velvet in my life, and
everyone that---

24:31.992 --> 24:33.472
- I'm going.
- Nobody's stopping you.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.475
No, you are, actually, Fred. In
a big way.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.043
It may not feel like it, but
you're putting a huge fucking
block in my road, okay?

24:40.130 --> 24:43.394
- Really.
- I don't want to be rude, but
you are.

25:25.175 --> 25:28.135
It's starting to make me, I
don't know, a little bit
worried...

25:28.222 --> 25:30.311
I guess, having you here.

25:30.398 --> 25:32.531
Worried?

25:46.588 --> 25:50.505
Where'd you get that name
anyway? Velvet. Where'd it come
from?

25:50.592 --> 25:53.116
Oh, come on. Shit, I don't know.

25:53.203 --> 25:56.511
- You know. Of course you do.
- No, I don't! I just started
using it!

25:56.598 --> 26:01.516
Bullshit. Come on. Was it some
guy gave it to you, like a
nickname?

26:01.603 --> 26:03.474
No.

26:05.346 --> 26:08.567
Well, what is it then? Is it for
like, what...

26:09.089 --> 26:11.265
the way that your, like...

26:11.352 --> 26:15.661
snatch feels around a guy's
thing?

26:18.098 --> 26:21.580
Your cunt? I mean, I'd believe
that if you told me that.

26:23.364 --> 26:28.238
Or your mouth? How soft your
mouth is?

26:31.633 --> 26:35.419
That's what I was wearing when a
guy first fucked me when I was
nine.

26:35.506 --> 26:38.597
I was raped in a dress I was
wearing to church that had
velvet bows on it.

26:39.119 --> 26:42.557
Do you still like it? Velvet?

26:46.126 --> 26:48.128
No. Not as much.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.522
Well, then.

26:55.526 --> 26:58.138
Jesus, is that...?

26:58.660 --> 27:01.141
Now you know.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.448
I mean, is that... honestly?

27:12.282 --> 27:15.198
No. God, no.

27:15.285 --> 27:19.594
You really think I'd fucking
tell you something personal
about myself? Fat fucking
chance.

27:22.292 --> 27:24.251
You bitch. That's horrible.

27:24.338 --> 27:27.210
Which part, the story or the
fact that it didn't happen?

27:27.297 --> 27:30.213
- All of it. Both.
- Well, don't worry...

27:30.300 --> 27:33.390
I'm sure it's happened to
somebody else.

27:33.477 --> 27:37.220
Just not me. Well, not like that
anyway.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.309
All right, I have to go.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.661
Wait, wait, wait. Whoever this
person is...

27:43.183 --> 27:46.490
you can put him off for a while,
all right? Come on, you have a
guest.

27:46.577 --> 27:50.233
- Guest I knew nothing about.
- Yeah, but so what? I'm here
now.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.671
- I can't.
- Why? Come on, wait, wait,
wait.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.674
I can't, Fred. I gave my word.

27:56.196 --> 27:59.678
Sorry, I didn't realize it was
that serious. You gave your
word.

28:00.200 --> 28:03.377
What are you, like some fucking
Indian chief?

28:03.464 --> 28:06.772
Who the fuck talks like that
anymore? "I gave my word."

28:07.250 --> 28:09.513
I mean, who talks like that?

28:09.600 --> 28:12.516
I can't. I said I can't, so I
won't.

28:12.603 --> 28:14.693
All right, okay, yeah, great.
I'll just let you go.

28:15.215 --> 28:18.392
Have your latte with your
married fella.

28:18.479 --> 28:22.701
He's gonna tell his spouse that
he has to run back to the office
really quickly "today, honey."

28:23.223 --> 28:25.529
Forgive me...

28:25.616 --> 28:30.709
for being so pedestrian about my
affairs, my comings and goings.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.278
See, I wished that you felt that
way...

28:35.365 --> 28:40.675
but I don't believe it for a
second that you feel at all
contrite.

28:40.762 --> 28:44.418
Oh, shit. What now, huh?

28:44.505 --> 28:46.725
What? What now?

28:47.247 --> 28:49.553
You can't even let a person say
sorry anymore...

28:49.640 --> 28:53.688
without jumping on it and
challenging every fucking word.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.821
What's the problem now?

28:56.299 --> 29:00.434
That. That. That. Exactly that.

29:00.521 --> 29:05.308
That you do not feel one little
bit sorry for what you do or who
you do it with.

29:05.395 --> 29:10.792
- Not a bit.
- Just go. Just go before I get
all...

29:10.879 --> 29:13.534
- What?
- What?

29:13.621 --> 29:15.754
What? Before you get all what?
Finish it.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.539
What's the next line after that?
What is it?

29:18.626 --> 29:20.715
I love when people do this, it
makes me laugh. Really.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.457
They say these things, but then
have nothing to back it up. What
is it?

29:24.545 --> 29:26.590
What are you talking about? I
just said, go.

29:26.677 --> 29:29.332
No. You made a threat. Let's
call it what it was.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.726
It was a threat. You threatened
me.

29:31.813 --> 29:35.556
You said "don't make me get
all..." what?

29:35.643 --> 29:38.733
- What's next?
- Fred, just go!

29:38.820 --> 29:40.779
No. I want to know what would
happen.

29:41.301 --> 29:45.305
What would happen if I chose not
to honor your request?

29:46.436 --> 29:48.612
Gosh, I don't know, I mean--

29:48.699 --> 29:51.746
Okay.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.488
What would I do...

29:54.575 --> 29:57.621
if you wouldn't leave and you
stayed?

29:57.708 --> 29:59.798
Okay, here's what I'd do.

30:01.974 --> 30:05.629
I would go upstairs, I would
lock the door...

30:05.716 --> 30:09.633
I would count to 100, and I
would pray...

30:09.720 --> 30:12.462
that you're gone when I came
down.

30:13.594 --> 30:16.379
That's what I'd do, Fred. That's
all I got.

30:16.466 --> 30:19.774
- That's my plan.
- Well, that's good.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.471
At least it's something.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.648
Fred.

30:24.735 --> 30:28.522
That's good. You have your
little plan, and that's good to
have that.

30:28.609 --> 30:31.873
But just so you know, I mean, it
wouldn't stop me.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.834
- Please don't say things like
that.
- What?

30:36.356 --> 30:38.662
Please don't say things like
that.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.926
Why? I'm not going to attack
you.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.929
Oh, come on. But I'm serious.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.844
I mean, if you go up there and
you close your bedroom door,
it'll take me how long...

30:46.366 --> 30:48.934
maybe five minutes to punch or
kick my way through it.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.893
Right? Tops.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.636
So I don't want you feeling all
secure when you go up there and
you close it...

30:55.723 --> 30:59.422
and you push that little button
on the handle. There.

30:59.509 --> 31:04.514
I mean, you're dreaming if you
think that that's going to make
you feel safe.

31:07.561 --> 31:10.433
If I wanted to get at you.

31:10.520 --> 31:14.829
Well, then I'd just leave the
door open...

31:14.916 --> 31:19.529
and hope that you snap out of
this and go.

31:23.794 --> 31:27.798
- Boy, you really want me gone,
don't you?
- Yeah, I do.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.890
And you really want me outta
here.

31:33.413 --> 31:35.589
You just want me to go. Can't
wait.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.591
You're about one minute away
from being officially not
welcome here.

31:37.678 --> 31:40.463
Seriously, sixty seconds from
it.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.726
- That's a threat.
- Really?

31:42.813 --> 31:46.905
How'd I do that? Big guy like
you? How's I able to do that?

31:47.427 --> 31:49.777
I don't know. Like that. You
could do that. I don't know.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.474
You could break something.

31:51.561 --> 31:53.912
You could do that. You could do
that.

31:55.826 --> 31:58.568
You could call the cops.

32:03.791 --> 32:06.881
That wouldn't be good for either
of us.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.927
Yeah, no, you're right.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.886
Not with all that cash...

32:11.973 --> 32:15.716
you no doubt have stashed around
here someplace.

32:16.717 --> 32:21.896
All that unearned income, right?
Well, I guess it isn't really
that unearned, is it?

32:21.983 --> 32:25.769
'Cause you work pretty hard for
it, don't you?

32:25.856 --> 32:28.859
Now, how else would you get me
outta here?

32:32.472 --> 32:35.866
I'd ask nicely, Fred. And I
will.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.783
Fred...

32:39.870 --> 32:42.656
it's been really good to see
you.

32:42.743 --> 32:45.964
Even if you don't believe it,
it's true. I'm glad.

32:46.486 --> 32:48.662
And maybe we can get a meal
sometime.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.970
Yeah, that'd be good, yeah.
Lunch. Yeah, that'd be great.
Let's eat.

32:52.492 --> 32:53.797
Fuck you!

32:56.409 --> 32:58.019
I guess that is the point,
really. It's why I came back
here, 'cause I wanna fuck you.

32:58.498 --> 33:01.762
Fuck you, Fred! I'm trying to be
some sort of civil person here.

33:01.849 --> 33:05.984
Yeah, okay. Yeah, all right. But
I mean, lunch? Really?

33:07.681 --> 33:09.683
Whatever.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.816
Don't do that. Don't say that.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.950
I can't stand the way you...

33:16.037 --> 33:18.605
young people say...

33:18.692 --> 33:23.566
And you use it for everything.
You make it fit for every little
thing that you--

33:23.653 --> 33:26.830
But do you want to have lunch
with me? Is that what you want?

33:26.917 --> 33:30.965
Do you want to sit down and eat
a salad or something and talk?

33:31.052 --> 33:34.012
Because I would love nothing
more than that.

33:34.534 --> 33:38.016
That's what I would love. That's
why I came.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.109
Or is that gonna cost me like
$500?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.678
Actually, I make up to $800
these days, so yeah I do
sometimes call that "lunch".

33:51.551 --> 33:53.857
What about with Chris?

33:53.944 --> 33:55.033
What do you call it with him,
lunch or do you call it
something different?

33:56.904 --> 33:59.776
- That is different 'cause he's
special.
- Yeah, I bet.

33:59.863 --> 34:02.040
He is. I don't know why it
matters to you because it
doesn't even matter what you
think...

34:02.562 --> 34:04.781
but Chris is very dear to my
heart. He's one of my great
friends.

34:04.868 --> 34:07.045
I can tell him anything. I can
tell him my feelings.

34:07.567 --> 34:10.744
I can tell him my actual dreams
and all that shit.

34:12.224 --> 34:15.879
You know he helped me get into
art school? I don't know if you
know that.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.012
No, I didn't. No. That's
wonderful.

34:18.099 --> 34:21.710
- Yeah. It's real wonderful.
- So, he and Mandy?

34:21.797 --> 34:25.018
Or just him?

34:25.106 --> 34:28.936
You can be such a fucking
bastard, Fred, that sometimes
it's actually breathtaking.

34:29.023 --> 34:33.592
No. What I am is a fucking fool.

34:34.855 --> 34:37.205
What a fucking idiot I was...

34:37.292 --> 34:41.643
to think I could come back here
and try to resurrect this
fucking hopeless--

34:41.731 --> 34:43.907
Let me ask you a question.

34:43.994 --> 34:47.085
When you first saw me when I
came back here today, did you
feel that way?

34:47.607 --> 34:50.088
- No. But now, yes.
- Now yes?

34:50.610 --> 34:53.656
But you're telling me, when I
first arrived and you saw me at
the door...

34:53.743 --> 34:57.094
didn't your heart just drop a
little bit? You thought like,
"Aw fuck."

34:57.617 --> 35:00.054
"What the fuck is Fred doing
here?" Tell me the truth.

35:00.141 --> 35:03.797
- It was a surprise.
- A nice surprise?

35:03.884 --> 35:05.929
Yeah, it was surprising. That
was my first--

35:06.016 --> 35:08.106
You caught me off guard, Fred.
That's what happened.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.934
So that was my first reaction,
surprise.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.937
Yeah, not anger, not feeling
sick.

35:14.024 --> 35:18.812
It was nice to see your face.
But it's surprising for you to
be here with me like this, it
is.

35:18.899 --> 35:21.684
No, I know. I totally agree.

35:21.771 --> 35:24.122
- Okay.
- I mean, I agree with that.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.820
Thanks. Thank you.

35:26.907 --> 35:29.692
But that's what I love about it.
That's why I'm here.

35:29.779 --> 35:32.956
The honesty, the surprise, I
mean...

35:33.043 --> 35:35.133
- Do you?
- Yes! That's why I'm here.

35:35.655 --> 35:39.963
You're seeing me! I wanted to
show you me, for the first time,
naked.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.096
This is me.

35:42.183 --> 35:45.839
This is the Fred that I always
wanted to show you.

35:45.926 --> 35:48.842
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah, but I don't think you
understand.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.758
I just don't think you get it.

35:51.845 --> 35:55.153
I have not been this person for
a long time.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.112
I mean, maybe not ever.

35:58.199 --> 36:02.116
Or maybe the first time I saw
you, that's when. Maybe not even
then. I don't know.

36:02.203 --> 36:05.772
Do you remember that? Do you
remember the first time that I
saw you?

36:05.859 --> 36:07.991
When Chris brought you up to the
lake house...

36:08.078 --> 36:12.257
and I was standing there
grilling at the barbecue like an
asshole...

36:12.344 --> 36:15.999
babbling away, talking to you,
making small talk.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.958
and Chris went into the house
and he was talking to his
mother?

36:18.045 --> 36:19.829
Do you remember?

36:19.916 --> 36:22.180
And I'm sitting there jabbering
on and on and on...

36:22.702 --> 36:25.879
and I was staring at you and you
were staring at me...

36:25.966 --> 36:30.840
and you had that cute little
smile on your lips.

36:32.277 --> 36:37.238
You just stared into my eyes,
and I don't think you blinked
once.

36:37.325 --> 36:40.023
And then you walked away...

36:40.110 --> 36:42.548
and you went into the house...

36:42.809 --> 36:45.768
to find my son.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.904
And I knew then...

36:50.991 --> 36:53.733
that we had to be together, that
I had to be with you.

36:55.865 --> 36:58.259
And that there was nobody more
important, more beautiful...

36:58.738 --> 37:01.915
or worth spending my time with.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.222
I knew that I loved you.

37:04.744 --> 37:07.225
And It's taken me a long time to
get there.

37:10.271 --> 37:12.230
And that's why I've come here.

37:12.752 --> 37:16.756
To get down on one knee and to
tell you how much I love you.

37:33.294 --> 37:38.081
It's been four years, though.

37:40.780 --> 37:44.044
I know. I know.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.829
Do you? Okay, just so you do.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.918
I do.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.270
Well, people...

37:52.792 --> 37:55.098
You know, people can do...

37:55.185 --> 37:57.275
Things can be...

37:57.362 --> 38:00.930
Yeah, people do funny things.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.019
Yeah. I know.

38:05.326 --> 38:10.244
Why are you doing this to me
today, Fred?

38:10.331 --> 38:13.943
'Cause I don't feel the same way
for you.

38:17.251 --> 38:20.254
Not in the same way that you're
saying.

38:20.341 --> 38:24.214
I don't. Not anymore.

38:25.215 --> 38:28.088
- You don't?
- No.

39:01.121 --> 39:02.862
I'm sorry.

39:05.125 --> 39:07.432
I'm sorry.

39:13.394 --> 39:17.877
Really, Fred, though, how could
I, you know? It's been so long.

39:19.139 --> 39:22.055
How is it possible? I mean, how
really--

39:22.142 --> 39:24.187
I'm sorry.

39:24.274 --> 39:29.192
You know, you said sorry before
and it didn't sound so great
then.

39:29.279 --> 39:33.022
And now it just sounds
repetitive. So could you come up
with something else maybe?

39:34.154 --> 39:38.376
Oh, God. Please don't be mean
right now.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.074
Well, what do you want me to be?

39:41.161 --> 39:43.381
I just left my other life for
you.

39:43.903 --> 39:46.166
For you!

39:47.167 --> 39:49.952
- I didn't ask you to.
- No, I know that.

39:50.039 --> 39:53.347
Okay, you're right. I'm aware of
that little crack in my fucking
armor...

39:53.434 --> 39:56.394
or my plan, or whichever one of
those fucking things gets a
crack in it.

39:56.916 --> 39:59.962
But still, what I did was I left
it for you. Okay?

40:00.049 --> 40:02.095
- And, Fred, it's very
flattering.
- Oh, come on!

40:02.182 --> 40:05.228
Don't fucking do that! Don't be
condescending to me!

40:05.315 --> 40:08.362
I am not a fucking toddler!

40:08.449 --> 40:12.366
All right? Things are not going
great for me right now, okay?

40:12.453 --> 40:17.240
So all I'm saying is that I
threw away, I pissed away my
other life for you.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.504
I'm sorry I didn't call first.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.115
- Stop.
- Stop? No, I can't stop. I
can't.

40:22.202 --> 40:24.247
So hang on to your hats, okay?
Hang on to them!

40:24.334 --> 40:27.990
Who the fuck says that anyway?
Is it the cowboys?

40:28.077 --> 40:31.124
Not like the football team or
the whatever. Not those.

40:31.211 --> 40:34.780
Like the wild west guys that
go-- Is it them? I don't know.
Fuck them.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.391
- I'm not sure.
- You what?

40:37.478 --> 40:40.525
I really do have to go make a
call because I'm actually close
to being late.

40:41.003 --> 40:45.138
Are you really? That's okay, I'm
sure that he'll wait for you.
He'll have an appetizer.

40:45.225 --> 40:48.054
That's not the point. It's the
right thing to do.

40:48.141 --> 40:52.450
The right thing. To call? Is
that how you do it now? It's
done with a call?

40:53.233 --> 40:56.541
- And I'd do the same for you.
- You would? Thank you so much.

40:57.019 --> 40:59.369
God, that's so nice of you.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.242
It's really true what they say
about you girls. You really do
have hearts of gold.

41:02.329 --> 41:05.288
Fuck, Fred! Fuck! What do you
want me to do!

41:05.375 --> 41:08.422
Seriously, what is it that you
want me to do for you!

41:08.509 --> 41:12.078
What is it? Just tell me what it
is!

41:12.165 --> 41:14.472
Ultimately, I want you to suck
my cock.

41:14.994 --> 41:17.518
But I'm willing to sweet talk
you a little more first.

41:17.997 --> 41:19.564
Gee, thanks.

41:22.131 --> 41:25.439
It's all right. Thank you for
being so good at your job and so
goddamned understanding.

41:25.526 --> 41:28.311
Fred, I gotta make a call
upstairs. So you do what you
want to do.

41:28.398 --> 41:30.531
- No, no, wait, wait.
- Whatever it is you want to do.

41:30.618 --> 41:33.186
- Wait! Wait! Just--
- No, Fred, no.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.493
- No, no, no!
- Don't stand in front of me
like that!

41:36.015 --> 41:38.060
Why not? Why shouldn't I make
things hard for you?

41:38.147 --> 41:40.193
- Stop it. Stop it!
- Why? Tell me why?

41:40.280 --> 41:42.456
- Come here. Sit down.
- No, stop it!

41:42.543 --> 41:44.197
Come on. Sit down. I want to
talk to you.

41:44.284 --> 41:47.461
Look, don't do it. Don't push
me, okay?
Don't.

41:47.548 --> 41:50.203
Don't do it. I don't want to be
pushed today, all right?

41:50.290 --> 41:52.335
I want you to sit down and I
want you to talk to me. Sit
down.

41:52.422 --> 41:55.513
- Or what?
- Or what?

41:56.035 --> 42:00.082
Really? Don't push me. You don't
want to know "or what".

42:00.169 --> 42:02.302
Sit down.

42:13.052 --> 42:15.533
- Now, do you need to make a
phone call?
- I'm sitting.

42:16.055 --> 42:18.492
- Good.
- I'm sitting.

42:18.579 --> 42:21.364
So go ahead, make your call.

42:21.451 --> 42:24.106
I have to go upstairs and make
it from the land line...

42:24.193 --> 42:27.109
'cause otherwise he won't
recognize the number and he
won't answer.

42:27.196 --> 42:30.112
Okay, so go up and get it.

42:30.199 --> 42:32.550
- Can I go now?
- Yeah, go, yeah.

42:33.072 --> 42:35.553
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

42:36.075 --> 42:39.382
- I'm getting up, okay?
- Yeah, get up and go get it,
yeah!

42:39.469 --> 42:43.082
Don't be so fucking dramatic.

43:41.140 --> 43:42.620
You find it?

43:43.664 --> 43:46.536
Did you find your phone?

44:12.301 --> 44:15.174
Use your sexy voice.

44:36.717 --> 44:39.372
Hi, yeah, it's me.

44:41.591 --> 44:44.638
I'm just calling because I'm
gonna be...

44:44.725 --> 44:49.208
I'm running a little bit behind.
Is that okay?

44:51.210 --> 44:54.779
Yeah, what time do they stop
serving lunch?

44:55.257 --> 44:58.391
Do you know what time the
kitchen closes?

44:58.478 --> 44:59.784
"Lunch".

45:01.220 --> 45:04.266
No. No, that was the TV.

45:04.353 --> 45:07.356
Hold on. Let me just turn it
down.

45:10.229 --> 45:12.274
What was that?

45:17.366 --> 45:19.760
That's so true.

45:19.847 --> 45:23.242
We can do whatever we want.

45:27.507 --> 45:29.552
I can't wait, either.

45:29.639 --> 45:34.253
All right, Chris. Okay. Bye.
Bye.

45:37.430 --> 45:39.737
No.

45:40.259 --> 45:42.304
Chris?

45:43.262 --> 45:46.395
No. My Chris?

45:47.266 --> 45:49.268
Yeah.

45:51.400 --> 45:55.361
No way. Seriously, who was that?

45:57.276 --> 46:01.759
It was Chris. I'm meeting him
later. I'm supposed to be there
any minute.

46:03.543 --> 46:06.720
Well, you better get going then.

46:06.807 --> 46:09.549
Fuck.

46:09.636 --> 46:12.857
- You told me to call from here.
- You could've resisted, all
right?

46:12.944 --> 46:15.598
Put up a little fight, at least
for my sake.

46:15.685 --> 46:19.472
That's bullshit. You bullied me
into it. Now you can't act all
hurt when--

46:19.559 --> 46:21.474
This is unbelievable.

46:21.561 --> 46:24.738
Fuck! Oh, my God! The irony of
it. I leave his mother today...

46:24.825 --> 46:29.438
to come and be with you, and
you're going out to meet him for
lunch!

46:30.657 --> 46:32.485
Oh, my God!

46:32.572 --> 46:34.879
- Sorry.
- No, don't be.

46:34.966 --> 46:37.795
- It's okay.
- Fred.

46:38.317 --> 46:42.582
No. You've broken the spell.

46:42.669 --> 46:43.757
Thank you.

47:05.605 --> 47:09.827
When you're settled, maybe we
can talk about this...

47:10.349 --> 47:12.525
and, you know, have a...

47:14.744 --> 47:17.399
- There's another one.
- What?

47:17.486 --> 47:19.749
Another half sentence that you
have no intention of finishing.

47:19.837 --> 47:22.622
- No, it isn't.
- Really?

47:22.709 --> 47:26.669
Okay, all right, all right,
let's finish it then. Okay?

47:26.756 --> 47:31.805
So, maybe when I get to my hotel
room and I get settled...

47:31.892 --> 47:35.548
I take my socks and I put them
away in the drawer and all that,
what?

47:35.635 --> 47:40.422
What do I do? I sit around and I
wait for you call?

47:40.509 --> 47:42.642
For lunch?

47:43.382 --> 47:46.428
- What?
- And then..

47:46.515 --> 47:49.431
then maybe we can, you know...

47:49.518 --> 47:53.392
talk about this thing between us
and...

47:54.915 --> 47:59.789
I don't know. Just not now. Just
not now.

48:00.660 --> 48:03.706
No, not when you're about to go
get my son's cock up your ass.

48:03.793 --> 48:06.405
That is bad timing.

48:09.538 --> 48:12.541
You're being so horrible today,
Fred.

48:13.412 --> 48:17.546
Horrible. What have I done to
you?

48:18.939 --> 48:22.900
- Do you really want the answer
to that?
- Yeah.

48:23.422 --> 48:25.598
I do, Fred, actually.

48:25.685 --> 48:29.558
Even if it makes me late, I do
want an answer to that.

48:39.438 --> 48:41.570
I don't know.

48:43.529 --> 48:45.879
All I know is that...

48:45.966 --> 48:48.447
I just hate you now. Because if
I can't have you, that's all I
have left, hate.

48:50.884 --> 48:53.887
Because if I can't have you,
that's all I have left.

48:55.454 --> 48:56.803
Hate.

48:58.979 --> 49:02.940
How is that fair? I mean, to
another person.

49:07.988 --> 49:10.512
Who said anything about fair?

49:10.599 --> 49:13.646
I mean...

49:13.733 --> 49:15.735
have you at all been listening
to me?

49:15.822 --> 49:17.955
- Yeah.
- You have?

49:19.869 --> 49:20.958
Because...

49:22.742 --> 49:26.615
we're talking about love here.
Okay?

49:27.486 --> 49:29.488
Love.

49:31.490 --> 49:34.580
When has love ever been fair?

49:36.495 --> 49:38.888
I guess that's right.

49:40.499 --> 49:42.762
It's completely right.

49:45.765 --> 49:48.898
Fred, maybe we can talk about
this...

49:50.030 --> 49:53.991
another time, you know, when...

49:54.513 --> 49:56.515
I don't know.

49:58.778 --> 50:02.347
- When?
- I don't know.

50:04.044 --> 50:06.699
Sometime in the near future.

50:06.786 --> 50:09.832
Okay. well, just give me a time.

50:10.659 --> 50:13.010
I mean, if I have to make an
appointment with you or
something...

50:13.532 --> 50:15.621
I'd rather do that and get it on
the books.

50:17.536 --> 50:22.715
- We don't have to do that right
now.
- No, no. It's easier for me.

50:22.802 --> 50:28.590
- So, what, Tuesday?
- Let me check.

50:32.942 --> 50:35.684
All right, Tuesday.

50:43.823 --> 50:46.695
I can't. I have class then.

50:47.827 --> 50:52.049
- Wednesday. What about
Wednesday?
- No, I can't do Wednesday. I'm
booked.

50:52.571 --> 50:54.964
Monday. I left out Monday.

50:57.837 --> 51:01.841
No I can't. I can't do Monday.

51:03.843 --> 51:07.586
All right, I don't know, you
just tell me. Tell me when. Tell
me.

51:07.977 --> 51:12.069
I can do... How's next weekend?

51:13.853 --> 51:16.769
Really? You're gonna squeeze me
in on the weekend?

51:16.856 --> 51:18.901
Like squeeze me in on Saturday?

51:18.988 --> 51:23.080
No, I can't do... How's Sunday?

51:23.602 --> 51:27.084
Are you serious? Really?

51:27.606 --> 51:32.785
"I can't do Saturday, but I can
do Sunday"? Really?

51:32.872 --> 51:34.743
Yeah.

51:37.006 --> 51:39.052
Okay, yeah. No, that's fine.
Yeah, I mean, that's fine.
Whatever.

51:39.139 --> 51:41.707
I'm here for you, okay? And if
you need that...

51:41.794 --> 51:44.101
you know, whatever you need. You
know, I'm here for you.

51:44.623 --> 51:48.105
If you need to squeeze me in
between your yoga class and your
job and your dog...

51:48.627 --> 51:50.759
whatever the-- you know.

51:50.846 --> 51:53.806
Maybe I should just take that
shuttle right back to Maryland
right now.

51:53.893 --> 51:56.765
- Maybe that's what I should
do.
- Maybe you should.

51:57.636 --> 51:59.768
Excuse me?

52:00.769 --> 52:03.076
- Nothing.
- No, go ahead, say it.

52:03.163 --> 52:07.080
I said, maybe you should. Maybe
you should go home and think
about it...

52:07.167 --> 52:10.083
and then call me on the phone...

52:10.170 --> 52:13.695
and we can talk about it and
see, you know, what's what
and...

52:13.782 --> 52:15.871
We don't have to have this big
scene here.

52:15.958 --> 52:19.962
- You think this is big?
- I do, yeah.

52:20.049 --> 52:23.749
- Then you have a lousy memory.
- Why, 'cause of how we ended?

52:23.836 --> 52:25.968
- Exactly.
- No, I haven't forgotten that.

52:26.055 --> 52:29.058
Really? That's good, great,
awesome.

52:30.930 --> 52:33.976
What are you so angry about,
Fred?

52:34.063 --> 52:38.938
So bitter. I haven't done
anything.

52:39.025 --> 52:43.725
So what? Shit happens to people
who haven't done anything all
the time.

52:43.812 --> 52:45.858
What does it matter?

52:45.945 --> 52:48.861
It just depends on how we deal
with it when it lands at our
feet.

52:48.948 --> 52:52.125
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that is right. That's
the truth.

52:52.212 --> 52:54.997
The lesson is in the struggle.

52:55.084 --> 52:58.175
That's what makes us shine...

52:58.697 --> 53:01.178
or roll over and die like little
bitches in the dirt...

53:01.700 --> 53:06.052
with our guts exposed and flies
shitting in our open mouths.

53:17.237 --> 53:19.196
I'm sorry.

53:20.849 --> 53:24.113
I'm not mad. I'm just...

53:26.246 --> 53:29.554
I'm just very, very
disappointed.

53:29.815 --> 53:31.991
I understand.

53:32.861 --> 53:36.038
No, you don't.

53:36.125 --> 53:42.219
Because if you did, you would
crawl over here and blow me.

53:42.741 --> 53:45.222
Just out of sympathy.

53:49.008 --> 53:51.880
Is that what you'd like?

53:53.273 --> 53:55.884
I wouldn't hate it.

53:59.018 --> 54:01.238
Is that what you'd like?

54:05.894 --> 54:09.246
Would that make you happy? Would
it?

54:09.768 --> 54:11.857
Don't, don't. Don't touch.
Don't.

54:11.944 --> 54:13.989
Would it make you happy?

54:14.076 --> 54:16.078
Don't! Don't! Don't do that!

54:16.165 --> 54:20.039
Don't play those games. Why do
you play those games? Why?

54:20.126 --> 54:23.260
- I hate games!
- I don't know what you mean.

54:23.782 --> 54:25.958
Is that what you do with Chris?
Do you play those little games
with him?

54:26.045 --> 54:30.179
Is that what you do? Little
kissy-kissy, lovey-lovey games
with him?

54:33.052 --> 54:37.186
Chris doesn't make me suck his
cock.

54:38.797 --> 54:42.627
He doesn't make me do anything.

54:42.888 --> 54:46.195
Well, isn't he a fucking pussy.

54:47.066 --> 54:50.939
I know he's really good with
computers and everything, but--

54:52.811 --> 54:55.292
Imagine what he thinks of you.

54:55.379 --> 54:58.947
I don't give a fuck what he
thinks about me.

54:59.948 --> 55:02.081
Not at all.

55:03.038 --> 55:05.998
I only know how I feel about
you...

55:06.085 --> 55:10.219
and he could never, ever feel
the same way that I do.

55:17.096 --> 55:18.837
Is that true?

55:19.838 --> 55:21.840
That's the truth.

55:22.231 --> 55:26.018
Isn't that what you like? The
truth?

55:26.105 --> 55:28.107
You are one of those people,
aren't you...

55:28.194 --> 55:33.068
who only wants the cold hard
truth.

55:33.155 --> 55:35.419
Aren't you one of those people?

55:35.897 --> 55:41.338
Do you hate everyone, or is it
just me?

55:44.993 --> 55:47.256
Now it's just you.

55:51.260 --> 55:54.263
That's kind of shocking to hear.

55:58.267 --> 56:00.269
You asked for it.

56:01.880 --> 56:06.363
I know. I know I did. It's
just--

56:15.023 --> 56:17.069
Where are you going?

56:17.156 --> 56:20.289
I'm going downstairs.

57:08.337 --> 57:11.428
You know, I didn't feel this way
an hour ago.

57:12.951 --> 57:15.954
I didn't come here to hate
you...

57:16.955 --> 57:21.133
nor to grind my ego into the
carpet in order for me to get to
that place.

57:21.220 --> 57:23.091
Don't say that, Fred.

57:25.703 --> 57:28.445
I don't regret any of the
feelings I've had for you or
seeing you. I never have.

57:28.967 --> 57:31.796
- Yeah?
- No, not one day.

57:32.057 --> 57:38.411
And if you didn't think I was in
love with you at some point,
then you just weren't listening.

57:41.109 --> 57:44.156
- Maybe not.
- No. Absolutely so.

57:44.243 --> 57:47.159
That there was a moment there
where...

57:47.246 --> 57:50.423
I would've run off to China with
you on a dog sled.

57:50.510 --> 57:54.166
I mean, I know that sounds
stupid, but you know what I
mean, anything.

57:54.253 --> 57:59.127
I would've done anything with
you or for you, all of it.

58:00.128 --> 58:03.480
I know. Fuck.

58:04.002 --> 58:07.048
I had you there for a second,
didn't I?

58:07.135 --> 58:10.312
Yeah. You did. Completely.

58:10.399 --> 58:12.619
Broke it off with your son and,
you know.

58:12.706 --> 58:16.449
All I wanted was just a little
bit of time, just to let the
smoke clear.

58:16.536 --> 58:19.060
And not even selfishly, not just
for me, but for everyone else...

58:19.147 --> 58:21.193
just so they weren't all crushed
in the wreckage...

58:21.280 --> 58:23.500
and that that didn't weigh on my
shoulders as well, you know.

58:24.022 --> 58:27.329
It was weeks actually, it was
just weeks, and you couldn't do
it.

58:27.416 --> 58:30.332
- No, I know, but--
- No, I'm talking now, Fred. I
am.

58:30.419 --> 58:32.857
And I listened to all your shit,
all your bile...

58:33.118 --> 58:36.295
and the mean-spirited crap that
you tossed my way.

58:36.382 --> 58:40.604
And now it's your turn to hear
me out. To hear what I have to
say. All right?

58:41.082 --> 58:44.085
Okay? I did have to back off a
bit.

58:44.172 --> 58:49.351
I had to turn it down a notch
'cause I just needed some
fucking space to breathe.

58:49.438 --> 58:53.530
To sleep in my own bed. So I
didn't feel like I had blood on
my hands.

58:54.052 --> 58:57.359
And you wouldn't let me do it.

58:57.446 --> 59:00.537
Your hand kept fucking
tightening around my neck...

59:01.059 --> 59:06.455
and I would wake up in the
morning and I would feel your
fucking fingers in my neck.

59:07.456 --> 59:10.329
And the messages...

59:11.330 --> 59:16.248
Hundreds of messages daily.

59:16.335 --> 59:20.121
And if I was busy or out or I
was doing something here...

59:20.208 --> 59:23.560
they just got so fucking mean
and so fucking dark.

59:24.082 --> 59:28.390
Horrible, that I couldn't take
it anymore.

59:28.477 --> 59:30.479
That was it.

59:35.354 --> 59:39.576
That's what people do when they
love each other. That's what
they do.

59:40.098 --> 59:42.404
When you love somebody, you want
to be near them, you want to be
with them.

59:42.491 --> 59:44.581
That's just the way it is. But
you don't see it that way.

59:45.103 --> 59:46.931
- No, I don't.
- Well, then fine.

59:47.192 --> 59:50.587
Let's just leave it where it is
then. Dead.

59:51.631 --> 59:54.416
- After all I did for you.
- Yeah, all you did for me.

59:54.503 --> 59:57.550
- But none of it was ever real
or genuine.
- Oh, come on.

59:57.637 --> 01:00:01.554
Please, all the gifts and the
fucking...
Oh, my God!

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:04.426
No, not gifts. Little tests and
traps...

01:00:04.513 --> 01:00:07.560
to see if I'd react or if I
wouldn't react.

01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:10.607
Little fucking prizes. I got
little fucking prizes.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:13.610
If I loved you enough. Oh,
fucking Fred.

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:16.569
Right. That sounds just about
right. Yeah, that's right.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:21.313
So unfucking grateful. I gave
you everything.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.620
- Fred. Fuck, I was never
ungrateful.
- Everything!

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:27.319
No, listen. Do you know what
everything is?

01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:31.453
Everything is everything. Not
just lots of things.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.456
Not just some things. Not just
what you wanted to give.

01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:38.199
- Really?
- It's all of it.

01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:41.246
It's all of it.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:45.206
Great. This is great. I really
love your little revisionist
history, okay?

01:00:45.293 --> 01:00:47.426
But what really happened, what
really happened...

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:50.690
was one day you were all kisses
and whispers...

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:55.347
and that tiny little smile of
yours, and then the next day it
was like that!

01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:59.351
You changed. It was just like I
was fucking your sister or
something.

01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:02.223
I mean, what is that? Your phone
calls started tapering off...

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:04.617
you pulled back emotionally.
What was that?

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:07.664
That's the shit that I'm talking
about. You choking me! That's
what I'm saying!

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.492
No, no, no, no. You changed.

01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:13.757
Something was gone. The way you
looked at me was different.

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:18.022
I had to take the pressure off.
I needed to put the brakes on. I
needed to slow us down.

01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:21.678
It didn't slow us the fuck down.
What you did was you brought us
to a dead stop.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.506
Wham! Like that! That's what
happened!

01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:28.510
- I had to.
- You didn't have to!

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:31.513
- You made a choice!
- No, I didn't. That's bullshit,
and you know it.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.820
And this right here is why you
hate games, do you know that?

01:01:33.907 --> 01:01:36.693
Because you can't stand to lose.
That's right, isn't it? No,
that's right.

01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:39.521
And it's fucking eating you up
inside because you know I didn't
pull my love away!

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:42.699
You know you pulled your fucking
love away! Minute by fucking
minute!

01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:46.267
And you lost me! You lost me and
that is the fucking truth!

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:48.705
And you don't want to
acknowledge that inside, the
fucking truth!

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:52.534
You don't want to fucking
acknowledge the fucking truth,
Fred!

01:01:52.621 --> 01:01:55.407
- Fuck!
- Don't you fucking hit me.

01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:58.236
Don't you fucking hit me!

01:02:03.502 --> 01:02:06.374
That's the way these things go,
man.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:10.291
Did you ever read "Lolita"?

01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:12.511
It ends badly.

01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:27.744
You are funny, Fred.

01:02:34.402 --> 01:02:36.535
You are. You're funny.

01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:41.322
Yeah, I'm a real card.

01:02:41.409 --> 01:02:43.760
You're a funny person, Fred.

01:02:44.282 --> 01:02:47.459
That's one of the things that
always attracted me towards you.

01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:50.767
- Really?
- Absolutely.

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:52.769
Jeez.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:57.425
And I thought it was my big
thick cock the whole time.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.737
There, you see?

01:03:04.824 --> 01:03:07.348
Even that's a little bit funny.

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:10.612
Thanks. And obviously not the
case.

01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:12.919
No, no, no, that's not true. I
like it just fine, but you--

01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:18.795
No. Jesus, don't finish that
sentence or I'll never take my
pants off again.

01:03:19.317 --> 01:03:22.363
I like it when you're like this.

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:24.496
I know.

01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:27.716
My stomach is in knots, but I'm
trying.

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:33.331
I know you are. I appreciate it.

01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:40.642
I know that you like the funny
me, the lighthearted me.

01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:42.819
You know, the...

01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:45.778
And I guess I thought that I'd
come back here and I'd knock on
your door...

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.824
and you'd let me in and I'd tell
you a few jokes...

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:51.653
and I'd be back in your loving
embrace.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:55.657
But you see how that's, I mean,
you see how that's impossible.

01:03:55.744 --> 01:04:00.837
You see how that's about a
hundred percent impossible, at
least now, this morning.

01:04:01.359 --> 01:04:03.404
No, I don't.

01:04:03.491 --> 01:04:06.799
I don't think anything's
impossible.

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:09.628
I don't. Nothing.

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:12.544
And that's the only thing that
stops us from waking up in the
morning and having our
Wheaties...

01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:14.676
and blowing our fucking brains
out.

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:17.810
- That little bit of hope.
- I'm not going to argue with
that.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:20.682
- You what?
- I'm not going to argue with
that.

01:04:20.769 --> 01:04:23.816
Well, you don't have to. It's
true.

01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:26.863
All right, Fred. I gotta go.

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:31.868
You can make some eggs or have a
bath in here before you leave,
if you want.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.567
And here's the...

01:04:35.654 --> 01:04:39.571
the spare key here that you...

01:04:39.658 --> 01:04:42.574
If you lock the door before you
go.

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:44.881
Wait, let me ask you something
before you go.

01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:48.449
- Just... why?
- Why what?

01:04:48.536 --> 01:04:52.845
Come here. Why? Why'd you do it
the first time?

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:56.457
- Do what?
- Put that note in my pocket.

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:59.896
- No. No.
- "Girl for sale." Why?

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:02.724
No, Fred, I can't do this now.
I'm fried from this morning...

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:04.857
and I'm not doing this now. I
have to go now.

01:05:06.685 --> 01:05:09.644
Yeah, okay, good. But you better
call the cops if you want me out
of here.

01:05:10.428 --> 01:05:12.821
I'm serious.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:17.261
I will burn this fucking brothel
of yours to the ground if you
walk out right now.

01:05:17.522 --> 01:05:20.438
Do you understand that, Velvet?

01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.921
Whatever you say, Fred.

01:05:25.443 --> 01:05:29.926
You've always had the card on
this thing of ours from the
beginning anyway, so.

01:05:30.448 --> 01:05:33.494
It's held, not had.

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:35.496
What?

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:38.543
When you're talking about cards.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:40.937
I know you're gonna say the
exact same thing to the next
fucking idiot...

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:43.504
who walks in here with his pants
down around his ankles.

01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:47.900
When you're talking about cards,
you say...

01:05:47.987 --> 01:05:50.511
"held" not "had".

01:05:50.598 --> 01:05:53.950
"You held all the cards."

01:05:54.472 --> 01:05:56.953
Okay, whatever the fuck it is,
you've always been the one
holding or whatever.

01:05:57.475 --> 01:06:00.652
No, that is complete and utter
crap.

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:05.744
Who was holding all the cards
the day you put that piece of
stationary into my pocket?

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:09.791
"Let's meet in the city for a
chat." A fucking chat.

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:12.533
You had the nerve to call it
that, a fucking "chat".

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.536
Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Let
me ask you a question.

01:06:15.623 --> 01:06:19.976
How many dads of how many
undergrads were you working on
at the time?

01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:24.676
I wanna ask this question. I've
never asked it because I wanted
to maintain some sort of
dignity.

01:06:24.763 --> 01:06:28.941
A sense of dignity or a sense of
self-esteem, but tell me, how
many got notes?

01:06:30.029 --> 01:06:32.771
- Just wanna know.
Just curious.
- You don't want to know that.
Not really.

01:06:32.858 --> 01:06:34.991
- No, I do.
- No, you don't.

01:06:35.513 --> 01:06:37.558
I mean, surprisingly, I actually
do.

01:06:37.645 --> 01:06:40.561
'Cause I feel like we're at the
end here of this.

01:06:40.648 --> 01:06:44.696
And, I don't know, there's like
a moment of clarity for me.

01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:47.090
So, how many were there? Just
round it off. Come on.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:52.008
Six. Five or six, maybe.

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:56.012
Wow... as you kids are prone to
say.

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:59.015
Wow. That's a lot.

01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:03.932
And how many takers?

01:07:06.544 --> 01:07:10.852
Four... probably. About that.

01:07:10.939 --> 01:07:13.551
Four? Jeez.

01:07:14.943 --> 01:07:18.034
- What about the other two?
- Not a word.

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:21.124
I got a few hang-up calls, but,
you know, what are they gonna
say?

01:07:21.602 --> 01:07:23.865
Yeah, true, yeah.

01:07:23.952 --> 01:07:28.044
So, is that how you, you know,
pay for tuition and books and
everything like that?

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.611
- Is that how you did it?
- Pretty much.

01:07:30.698 --> 01:07:33.049
And I got a trip to Europe one
summer, and Morocco, too.

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:36.052
And Morocco, she says. And
Morocco.

01:07:36.574 --> 01:07:38.663
Wow. Bully for you.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:43.624
It is what it is. I'm not
exactly beaming with pride over
here.

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:47.019
Yes, but you're not exactly on
your knees begging for God's
forgiveness are you?

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.891
- No, I guess not.
- No.

01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:52.981
You're just comfortably right in
the middle, aren't you?

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.637
I'm not a murderer, Fred, if
that's what you're implying.

01:07:56.724 --> 01:07:58.857
It was just something that I
did.

01:07:58.944 --> 01:08:04.036
Yeah, no, that's fine. I mean,
you know, it was a game, right?
A game.

01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:07.039
And we're all adults and, you
know, just, you know?

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:10.782
You just had all these daddies
trying to get into your tight
little pants.

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.001
It's a good racket. I gotta hand
it to you.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:16.917
No, it wasn't a racket, Fred. It
was a job, an after school job.

01:08:17.005 --> 01:08:21.053
Yeah? It was a job and you just
accidentally fell for me?

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.795
Out of all those other guys?

01:08:23.881 --> 01:08:26.798
- Kind of, yeah.
- I don't believe that. Sorry.

01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:30.106
- That's romance novel
bullshit.
- It doesn't matter, it's true.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:35.067
And what about them? What about
the other guys?

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:38.636
Not that I care about second
place, but what happened to
them?

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:45.817
Some of them fell for me like
you did, whether I felt that way
or not.

01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:49.125
We made a mess of things. That's
how it goes, you know that. It's
a risk.

01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.737
And then a couple of them were
great. We'd go to a hotel or a
spot uptown...

01:08:52.823 --> 01:08:56.131
and I'd take the train up or
whatever, and then I'd be back
in class by nightfall...

01:08:56.654 --> 01:08:59.700
$500 richer than I was that
morning.

01:08:59.787 --> 01:09:03.139
It doesn't suck to only work two
or three hours a week.

01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:06.707
You know, when you're in school.

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:08.970
See, I would use a different
choice of words.

01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:13.975
And "suck", when you're
describing the situation, could
be confusing.

01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:17.153
Make fun of me if you want, but
I see it as work.

01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:19.502
That's how I see it.

01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:22.984
I think that you need to see it
a little differently next time.

01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:24.160
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:28.729
So I can what, know that I
should be working in an
Applebees?

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:32.733
Or stripping? Or strutting my
stuff at Hooters?

01:09:32.819 --> 01:09:34.996
Is that what you think?

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:37.999
You use what you have, Fred, and
that's what I did.

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:40.176
Chris is good with computers,
and so he gets paid for that...

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:43.743
and you're an attorney and
that's your gift, you know...

01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:47.747
and I have tits, and I'm not
sorry that I let men use me once
in a while.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:50.011
You can try and make me feel
guilty...

01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:53.928
and tell me what I did was a bad
thing, but it wasn't. It wasn't
for me.

01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:56.757
And you may not like it or
understand it...

01:09:56.844 --> 01:09:59.107
but I did what I had to do at
the time.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.198
I still do from time to time.

01:10:06.245 --> 01:10:09.205
- Anyway, I have to go, Fred.
- No, wait, wait!

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:11.990
No! What do you want! You're
just mean all the time!

01:10:12.077 --> 01:10:16.777
I'm just asking what happens
now! It's a serious question!

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:20.216
- I've already said!
- That's right, you could pencil
me in on Sunday.

01:10:20.738 --> 01:10:23.219
- Gosh, how could I forget?
- You don't have to.

01:10:23.741 --> 01:10:25.786
No, it's fine! Something to look
forward to.

01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:27.919
- You're being an ass now,
aren't you?
- Sorta, yeah.

01:10:28.006 --> 01:10:32.053
- Fuck it. Let's forget it then.
- And I thought it was all going
so well.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.927
- Fred, please...
- No, you're right. Okay, fuck!

01:10:36.014 --> 01:10:38.799
This is crazy. We're going
around in circles. I'm
exhausted.

01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:41.802
Here's what we do. You're gonna
go for your lunch thing, okay?

01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:44.805
- And then you're gonna call
me.
- I will.

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:47.199
- Fine. If you give me a kiss
first.
- What?

01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:50.246
You heard me. Come on, it's just
a kiss.

01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:53.205
- I'm not sure that's true.
- Come on, just a little peck.

01:10:53.292 --> 01:10:57.165
- I'm not sure that's such a
good idea.
- Pretty please?

01:10:58.297 --> 01:11:01.953
- Okay, you can give me a kiss
on the cheek.
- Fuck the cheek.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.043
I want the whole-- All right,
look. All right, we'll prorate
it.

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:08.220
Okay, so $500. That's probably
what, like...

01:11:08.307 --> 01:11:11.092
A kiss would be $75 all in?

01:11:11.179 --> 01:11:13.269
- Don't say things like that.
- All right, I'm sorry.

01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:16.228
But I'm serious. Just a
little...

01:11:16.315 --> 01:11:19.100
I'll give you one for free if
you let me go straight
afterwards.

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:23.061
Really? That's a deal. Okay,
great. Let's do it.

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:26.978
No, you come here and kiss me.
I'm the girl.

01:11:27.065 --> 01:11:29.285
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:36.204
You ready? Okay.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:03.275
You always could kiss.

01:12:03.362 --> 01:12:06.322
- You, too.
- I forgot.

01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:12.153
Me, too.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.157
- No, I have to go.
- Wait, come here, come here.

01:12:16.244 --> 01:12:19.247
Just one more. Come here. Come
here.

01:12:30.128 --> 01:12:32.348
What? Please don't, don't.

01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:35.916
Let me just stay here for a
second. Don't ruin it.

01:12:36.003 --> 01:12:38.092
Don't.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:47.014
I'm really gonna be late. I'm
gonna be late. I'll see you
Sunday anyway.

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:51.367
- I hope so.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:54.370
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:58.374
You know, if it happens
naturally or whatever.

01:12:58.896 --> 01:13:02.203
What do you mean, "naturally"?
What does that mean?

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:05.076
- You know.
- Come here.

01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:09.950
What does it mean exactly,
"naturally"? You mean with or
without a condom?

01:13:10.037 --> 01:13:13.954
No, I'm kidding. Really. Just
tell me what it means just so I
know.

01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:16.348
Start again as friends or
whatever.

01:13:16.435 --> 01:13:21.962
- Us? Friends?
- If you don't get too pushy
about things.

01:13:22.049 --> 01:13:26.097
- Okay.
- If you take it easy.

01:13:26.184 --> 01:13:28.969
I can do that.

01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:34.975
And if we start at regular hours
at first. Daytime hours.

01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:38.239
- You mean like lunch?
- Yeah.

01:13:38.326 --> 01:13:42.069
But not as in code, like real
food.

01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:46.073
Maybe then.

01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:54.430
- Anything else?
- No, just like, things like
that.

01:13:56.344 --> 01:13:59.391
Are you sure there's nothing
else, no other rules...

01:13:59.478 --> 01:14:04.440
or guidelines that I have to
follow in order to be in your
presence?

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:07.094
- Fred!
- What?

01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:11.142
I'm only kidding, really. When
did you stop being able to take
a joke?

01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:14.101
Right around the time they stop
being funny.

01:14:15.363 --> 01:14:17.453
Gosh, you're getting quicker,
aren't you?

01:14:17.975 --> 01:14:20.412
- I learned from the best.
- I hope that means me.

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:23.154
- I was referring to Chris,
actually.
- You know what...

01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:26.157
if you love Chris so much, go
have fucking lunch with him.
I'll be right here.

01:14:26.244 --> 01:14:29.465
- I don't need your permission,
Fred.
- You know what, just go.

01:14:30.988 --> 01:14:35.253
I can go? Oh, thank you. Thank
you so much.

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:39.170
- You know what? You're pushing
it. Get out.
- You know what?

01:14:39.257 --> 01:14:42.434
I actually don't feel
comfortable leaving you here.

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.306
This has been nice, or I've
tried to make it nice...

01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:49.180
but now I think you should go. I
think it's time that you leave.

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:51.487
- More threats.
- It's not a threat.

01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:57.144
It's a simple fucking fact that
you have to leave. Now.

01:14:59.016 --> 01:15:02.019
All you had to do is ask nicely.

01:15:06.414 --> 01:15:09.417
Do you want to help me with
these bags, please?

01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:14.074
- Gimme a kiss. Just one kiss.
- No! No! No! No, Fred!

01:15:14.161 --> 01:15:16.468
Stop jerking me and fucking--!
What's wrong with you!

01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:19.079
- Come here! Just come here!
- Fred! Fuck!

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:22.039
Shut up! Just get over here!

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:28.524
You fucking--!

01:15:29.046 --> 01:15:30.569
Come here! Come here!

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:42.059
Shut up! Shut up!

01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:55.551
Shut up!

01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:20.157
Say hi to Chris for me.

01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:52.668
Hey, you all right?

01:17:55.192 --> 01:17:58.325
- Yeah.
- You sure?

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:04.375
My gosh, wow. That was really--
Did I hurt you?

01:18:04.462 --> 01:18:07.378
- No. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:10.381
- Did I hurt your head?
- I think you pulled a few hairs
out.

01:18:10.468 --> 01:18:13.689
- I'm really sorry. I'm really
sorry.
- Did I hurt your hand? I feel
like...

01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:16.692
You bit it, but you didn't break
the skin or anything.

01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:19.695
Listen. About the no condoms
thing...

01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:23.394
you can't tell anybody that,
okay? Nobody can know that.

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:27.267
Who am I gonna tell? I sit at a
computer all day, you know?

01:18:27.354 --> 01:18:30.706
You have a vivid imagination for
a computer guy.

01:18:31.228 --> 01:18:35.275
Yeah, I know. Anyway. So, okay.

01:18:35.362 --> 01:18:37.538
- I really love that accent that
you do.
- You do?

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:41.673
- Yeah. I love when you're, you
know.
- It's my grandma's accent.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.416
Really? Wow, it's really good.

01:18:45.503 --> 01:18:50.551
Here, okay. Here you go. So
that's that, the usual.

01:18:50.638 --> 01:18:53.729
And then, here's extra 'cause...

01:18:54.251 --> 01:18:56.253
we went over.

01:18:56.644 --> 01:18:59.560
- And then, and then just a
little...
- That's cool.

01:18:59.647 --> 01:19:04.565
Here, take a little extra 'cause
I broke that thing over there.
I'm really sorry about that.

01:19:04.652 --> 01:19:09.570
No, that's fine. That's just
something from Crate & Barrel.
The agency will take care of
that.

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:12.312
Okay, all right, good. Okay,
great. I better get going.

01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.445
- Gotta go?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:16.664
- Give me a hand.
- I know you got stuff to do.

01:19:17.535 --> 01:19:19.755
- Okay, you all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:26.718
I love how you always get to be
like other professions and I'm
always a hooker.

01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:30.722
Yeah, I know. Well, next time
you can be whatever you want to
be.

01:19:30.809 --> 01:19:34.682
- I wanna be a nurse.
- Great. I'll be the patient.

01:19:38.425 --> 01:19:42.690
I gotta get all this stuff back
to
Goodwill.

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:46.607
No, I'm dropping it off at
Goodwill, I am.

01:19:46.694 --> 01:19:48.784
I'm not kidding, I am.

01:19:49.436 --> 01:19:53.484
- All right, next time.
- Yeah, right, thanks.

01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:58.489
No, next week I can't come. I
have a family thing...

01:19:58.576 --> 01:20:02.841
- but I'll call you.
- Promise?

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.713
Yeah. Of course I promise.

01:20:06.714 --> 01:20:08.499
All right, okay.

01:20:08.847 --> 01:20:10.806
Okay, bye.

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:21.338
Good-bye, Velvet.

01:20:22.861 --> 01:20:26.343
- Yeah, bye, Fred.
- I know...

01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:30.826
You're sure you're okay? All
right. See you later.

01:20:31.348 --> 01:20:33.741
- Bye.
- Bye.
