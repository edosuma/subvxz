00:04.238 --> 00:07.573
So... you broke in Lucia's house

00:07.575 --> 00:10.976
and you planted a... vase.

00:10.978 --> 00:14.446
And how is this supposed
to help Erik exactly?

00:14.448 --> 00:17.016
Well, if the police search her house...

00:17.018 --> 00:18.450
Oh, yes, the police.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.485
And did you think what will happen

00:19.487 --> 00:21.620
if they found out you did this?

00:21.622 --> 00:22.921
Well, they'd understand

00:22.923 --> 00:24.023
because we did it for a good reason.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.158
I understand that you want to help,

00:26.160 --> 00:28.193
but this isn't the way to go about it.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.595
Then what is?

00:29.597 --> 00:31.497
The best thing to do is to just...

00:31.499 --> 00:33.599
stay out of this.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.234
Look... Please.

00:35.236 --> 00:39.772
We will handle this. You can trust us.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.975
Uh, can I go to the bathroom real quick?

00:42.977 --> 00:44.943
I had about five glasses of O.J.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.479
Gotta get that vitamin "C"!

00:47.481 --> 00:51.884
And a glass of milk
for... calcium, yeah.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.719
And a glass of ginger ale

00:53.721 --> 00:56.255
for, uh... burping.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.459
Please?

01:00.461 --> 01:02.194
Fine!

01:02.196 --> 01:05.030
I'll be right back.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.011 --> 01:21.246
We can't do anything at the moment.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.917
There has to be an exception
for situations like this.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.652
Bernard?

01:26.654 --> 01:27.986
We have to wait.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.521
For how long?

01:29.523 --> 01:31.490
As long as Erik remains under suspicion

01:31.492 --> 01:33.092
of this theft, we can't proceed.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.693
We're powerless.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.463
I cannot believe that Erik
is guilty of theft.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.665
He'd never do such a thing.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.866
Mmm, I agree.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.968
What about the evidence in his house?

01:42.970 --> 01:44.436
We can't ignore that.

01:44.438 --> 01:48.440
Let's just hope that
Erik is cleared and soon.

01:48.442 --> 01:52.678
Go home, and please
try to stay out of trouble.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.148
I'll tell your brother
to catch up with you.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.450
Shouldn't Jake be out by now?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.786
Based on the average
human bathroom activity...

02:00.788 --> 02:03.055
I don't want to know.

02:03.057 --> 02:06.258
Besides, I don't think
he went to the bathroom.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.229
Let's go around back.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.465
Maybe we can see what he's up to.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.206
And that is why
Amelia Earhart is my hero

02:21.208 --> 02:22.541
and should be yours too.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.810
- Aww! Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

02:24.812 --> 02:27.346
That was so convincing.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.315
Amelia Earhart is now my hero too.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.450
And you, young lady,

02:31.452 --> 02:33.752
are going to ace this presentation.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.786
Now, let's get ready for school!

02:34.788 --> 02:36.255
You know what?

02:36.257 --> 02:37.756
When your brothers and sister
so early this morning,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.825
I thought you had overslept.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.560
Oh, yeah.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.495
Uh, they had to go to school early

02:43.497 --> 02:44.730
because they had a...

02:44.732 --> 02:46.999
meeting about...

02:47.001 --> 02:51.703
phones and... bikes...

02:51.705 --> 02:54.039
'cause texting and cycling
does not go together.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.941
- So...
- Here, Evie, here's your bag.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.743
Is Evie going to school too?

02:57.745 --> 03:01.013
Yeah, I arranged for Evie
to spend the day at school

03:01.015 --> 03:03.448
so she can get used to it
before she officially starts.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.551
Okay.

03:05.553 --> 03:08.687
Prepare... for...

03:08.689 --> 03:10.222
takeoff!

03:10.224 --> 03:11.990
Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of Anika Airlines,

03:11.992 --> 03:15.160
I welcome you on this flight to school.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.728
Here we go!

03:22.836 --> 03:25.571
We gotta be able to do
something to speed things up.

03:25.573 --> 03:28.507
Where are the children?

03:28.509 --> 03:30.776
One of them is in the bathroom.

03:30.778 --> 03:34.146
The others are waiting outside for him.

03:34.148 --> 03:35.981
- I told them to go home.
- Hmm.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.950
They won't interfere again.

03:37.952 --> 03:41.753
Well, that's one
less thing to worry about.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.589
Now, what is Erik is found guilty?

03:43.591 --> 03:45.591
We need a backup plan.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.092
I don't believe it's a good idea

03:47.094 --> 03:49.561
to leave one of those
kids alone in this building.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.929
I happen to know

03:50.931 --> 03:53.198
they're the most curious
kids in the world.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.633
I'll check the
bathroom in a minute.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.802
In the meanwhile, I agree.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.270
I think we need to put
a backup plan in place.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.504
Absolutely.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.606
Get away... Doing...

04:00.608 --> 04:02.741
No! Aah! Get a... Nooo!

04:04.945 --> 04:08.046
What happened?

04:08.048 --> 04:11.149
So much for stealthy exit.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.851
Come on, we gotta help him.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.623
Heh!

04:21.528 --> 04:23.762
So you ready for this big day?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.564
You're a big girl

04:25.566 --> 04:28.233
and you're gonna be just fine.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.468
You're not going by yourself.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.436
Because you have your big sister

04:31.438 --> 04:33.472
to take you to your
classroom, all right?

04:33.474 --> 04:35.107
She bought her first plane... No!

04:35.109 --> 04:37.509
All right, Anika, can you
take your sister to...

04:37.511 --> 04:40.312
Her classroom?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.080
- Her first plane.
- Six months...

04:42.082 --> 04:45.017
Anika, you have to take
Evie to her classroom, baby!

04:45.019 --> 04:47.586
Oh, I almost forgot my passenger!

04:47.588 --> 04:49.421
Oh! Don't worry, Kate.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.023
I'll get Evie in her
classroom safe and sound.

04:51.025 --> 04:53.125
- Thank you.
- Give me a big pre-landing hug.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.594
Good luck. Have fun.

04:55.596 --> 04:56.628
Bye, girls.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.863
The runway's in sight.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.765
- Are you ready for takeoff?
- Ready.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.700
Whoo!

05:04.405 --> 05:07.339
Ms. Flowers is the sweetest teacher.

05:07.341 --> 05:09.508
Thank goodness
Ms. Clutterbee doesn't teach

05:09.510 --> 05:11.076
the lower grades anymore.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.878
"Detention! All of you!"

05:14.148 --> 05:16.515
Oh, I have to go to my own class.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.016
But I'll pick you up later, okay?

05:18.018 --> 05:19.518
Then we can go have lunch together

05:19.520 --> 05:20.952
- in the cafeteria.
- Okay.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.622
- Good luck!
- Bye-bye!

05:23.624 --> 05:25.924
Everybody sit down, please.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.259
Class is about to start.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.967
- Now what?
- We have to get in.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.769
Jake's in trouble. We have to help him!

05:37.771 --> 05:39.237
Ha!

05:41.375 --> 05:42.974
Ohh!

05:44.945 --> 05:47.179
What did I say?

05:47.181 --> 05:49.114
No more interfering!

05:49.116 --> 05:50.148
I wasn't interfering.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.216
It's just there's so many doors,

05:51.218 --> 05:52.484
so easy to get lost.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.785
What did you hear?

05:53.787 --> 05:55.153
Nothing, just Erik is blah blah blah

05:55.155 --> 05:56.488
gonna blah blah blah.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.723
So what is happening with Erik?

05:57.725 --> 05:58.857
That has nothing to do with you?

05:58.859 --> 06:00.092
But we wanna help!

06:00.094 --> 06:02.027
If you want to help,
let the adults handle it.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.262
- Please show Jake to the door.
- But what if... Ugh!

06:05.599 --> 06:09.134
Ice cream! Come get your ice cream!

06:09.136 --> 06:10.969
We've got everything you like.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.238
Come on out!

06:13.240 --> 06:15.340
I guess The Relatives
don't like ice cream.

06:20.414 --> 06:23.548
Sorry, we're all sold out.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.019
Note to self.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.855
Never impersonate an ice cream truck

06:29.857 --> 06:31.456
if you don't have any ice cream!

06:31.458 --> 06:32.924
Those kids were brutal!

06:32.926 --> 06:34.393
Shh! I'm trying to listen.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.895
- Oh, anything?
- No.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.063
Well, we have to get in there.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.631
Maybe there's a window somewhere,

06:39.633 --> 06:40.899
or a fire escape, or an air vent...

06:40.901 --> 06:42.667
Back away, Einstein!

06:42.669 --> 06:44.002
I have a better solution.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.072
We're gonna break down that door.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.307
I'm really sorry about all this, okay?

06:49.309 --> 06:52.210
But we've got rules
that we have to abide by.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.981
The Relatives are dealing
with a number of challenges,

06:55.983 --> 06:58.316
and Erik being charged with theft,

06:58.318 --> 07:01.653
it's a bit more than we can handle.

07:01.655 --> 07:05.390
Your father is very important to us.

07:05.392 --> 07:10.061
And we're doing everything
we can to clear his name.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.965
Do you think we might have made it worst

07:13.967 --> 07:15.267
with the fake vase and all?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.903
Well, you made a bit of a mess.

07:17.905 --> 07:21.139
But you know what they say
about that, right?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.041
Well, when you make a mess,

07:23.043 --> 07:25.143
you should clean it up yourself.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.549
We will. Thanks, Bernard.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.551
All right. Go on now.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.329
Today, I'm gonna tell you
about my hero, Amelia Earhart.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.732
She was born on July 24th, 1897,

07:47.734 --> 07:51.803
and she took her flying lessons in 1921.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.306
And, uh, bought her first...

07:56.810 --> 08:01.246
Okay, on the count of three, okay?

08:01.248 --> 08:05.150
One... two... three!

08:08.288 --> 08:09.654
Are you okay?

08:09.656 --> 08:10.856
What did you do to him?

08:10.858 --> 08:13.792
Guys, I'm fine.
Thanks for showing me out.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.561
Think about what I said, okay?

08:16.563 --> 08:18.763
What? What did he just say?

08:18.765 --> 08:20.031
Oh, that we have cleaning up to do.

08:20.033 --> 08:24.469
Wh... What happened in there?

08:24.471 --> 08:26.805
One moment, you're
signaling you're okay,

08:26.807 --> 08:28.607
and the next, you start screaming.

08:28.609 --> 08:33.211
Oh, that was... Oh, uh...

08:33.212 --> 08:34.813
Oh, would you look at the time?

08:34.815 --> 08:37.182
We have, uh, got to get home.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.217
Yeah, I have some urgent...

08:39.219 --> 08:41.352
sketching to do, yeah.

08:41.355 --> 08:45.690
I do my best work
at this time... every day.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.163
What do you think he's screaming about?

08:52.165 --> 08:53.899
Something must've scared him.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.901
I bet it was a big, hairy spider.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.703
Nah, it's not spider season.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.206
Then what do you think
it was, Mr. Biologist?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.775
A rat for sure, 100%.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.343
Wanna bet?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.412
Two weeks dishwasher duty.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.581
Heh! You're on.

09:12.553 --> 09:16.254
Um, she bought her first plane...

09:18.458 --> 09:21.326
Just six...

09:21.328 --> 09:25.163
She bought her first plane...

09:25.165 --> 09:28.166
Um... she...

09:28.168 --> 09:30.669
Anika, um, is everything all right?

09:32.839 --> 09:34.306
Uh...

09:35.542 --> 09:38.944
Anika, um, is everything all right?

09:38.946 --> 09:42.113
Yes, but...

09:44.418 --> 09:46.451
I forgot to lock my bicycle.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.619
So, I'll be right back.

09:54.361 --> 09:58.163
Okay, guys, let's keep it quiet.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.836
So you didn't find anything

10:04.838 --> 10:05.870
when you were "in the bathroom"

10:05.872 --> 10:07.172
at The Relatives' house?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.473
Only that they're worried

10:08.475 --> 10:09.874
because of what's going
to happen to Erik.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.245
But you said that Bernard
told you to clean up the mess.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.549
So, what can he mean by that?

10:17.551 --> 10:18.883
I don't know.

10:18.885 --> 10:21.753
So we're back at square one.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.356
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.124
If we can snag
the fake vase from Lucia's

10:26.126 --> 10:29.594
before she notices, it'll be
like nothing ever happened.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.363
Back to square one.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.632
That's what Bernard meant!

10:33.634 --> 10:35.400
He wants us to clean up the mess!

10:35.402 --> 10:36.801
The mess is the vase!

10:36.803 --> 10:38.203
So we clean up the vase!

10:38.205 --> 10:40.939
But then we have to go
back into Lucia's house.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.274
Well, I mean, I don't think
we have any other options.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.510
Come on, uh, where's my phone?

10:49.049 --> 10:53.151
Oh, no, where'd I put it?

10:53.153 --> 10:56.454
Whoa! Ohh!

10:56.456 --> 11:00.392
Whoa! Oh! Huh?

11:00.394 --> 11:03.595
Oh... Oh!

11:03.597 --> 11:07.065
It's fake. Wow, it looks really real.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.034
Is it yours? Can I borrow it?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.702
Go ahead.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.303
Yeah, cool.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.039
Oh, there's my phone!

11:14.041 --> 11:15.473
You better get

11:15.475 --> 11:17.409
those dishwashing gloves ready.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.012
Where could she be?

11:24.885 --> 11:26.818
Now...

11:41.401 --> 11:42.934
Evie!

12:04.057 --> 12:06.524
Ten and a half, nine and a half...

12:11.832 --> 12:13.131
Five and a half...

12:13.133 --> 12:15.233
Now, minus 14X.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.703
equals minus 12, then "X" equals...

12:18.705 --> 12:21.372
Who left the classroom?

12:34.955 --> 12:38.523
What? Lucia has guards now?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.458
Do you think they suspect something?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.160
Looks like it.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.195
Do you think she knows
we were in her house before?

12:44.197 --> 12:47.265
I don't know, but she must
know something's up.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.003
Poor guys.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.538
Not only do they have to guard her,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.006
but they have to take out her trash too.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.946
You know, that dumpster
gives me an idea.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.458
Do you think the
neighbor will notice it's gone?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.594
Oh, of course not... I hope.

13:16.596 --> 13:21.199
What's your plan exactly?

13:21.201 --> 13:23.568
Well, I'll saw the bottom
out of this dumpster

13:23.570 --> 13:25.370
so that you can move
without being noticed.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.306
This dumpster is the perfect disguise.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.607
Hmm!

13:29.609 --> 13:31.309
Yeah, we'll definitely have to throw

13:31.311 --> 13:32.677
some garbage in there.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.679
Fake garbage to cover you.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.649
Good thinking, but what
happens when we get there?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.752
Well, when the guard puts
the dumpster out by the shed,

13:40.754 --> 13:42.654
we'll switch it in with this one.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.689
Then, you'll enter
the house, grab the vase,

13:44.691 --> 13:47.158
get out of the house,
and then you have to

13:47.160 --> 13:49.561
get back in the dumpster,
move away from the house,

13:49.563 --> 13:51.062
And then we'll switch out our dumpster

13:51.064 --> 13:52.530
with the real dumpster.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.867
Oh, is that all?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.635
Um... yeah!

13:57.637 --> 13:59.470
So why aren't you going in the dumpster?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.905
Well, because there's
no way three people

14:00.907 --> 14:02.407
will fit inside this dumpster.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.159
No, I mean, why aren't
you going instead of me?

14:04.166 --> 14:04.742
Or me?

14:04.744 --> 14:06.878
Well, because I have to
be on the lookout.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.012
I don't know, dude.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.147
Seems like a lot could go wrong.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.983
Nah... trust me.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.017
It'll be easy as pie.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.552
Well, actually, pi is quite complex.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.987
See, it's an irrational number
where cannot be divided...

14:15.989 --> 14:19.457
Pie! Not pi!

14:21.928 --> 14:24.963
Ugh... as in, like, you know, apple?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.832
Never mind, all right?

14:27.834 --> 14:30.568
Trust me. It'll work.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.971
I'm sure. All right.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.443
No fair!

14:38.445 --> 14:40.411
You're supposed to be
counting while I hide.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.413
Why are you not in your classroom?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.249
I wanted to play with you.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.517
This is school.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.620
You can't just run off
whenever you want.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.288
Do you understand?

14:50.290 --> 14:52.557
There you are.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.261
Anika, I know public speaking
can be scary, but...

14:56.263 --> 14:57.862
Who's this?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.142
Check this out!

15:11.144 --> 15:13.878
Aah! There's a giant spider in here!

15:13.880 --> 15:15.747
Where?!

15:15.749 --> 15:16.814
It's in there!

15:16.816 --> 15:17.849
It's gigantic, and hairy,

15:17.851 --> 15:19.951
and it has big eyes, and fangs...

15:19.953 --> 15:21.419
- Spiders have fangs, right?
- Yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.787
Don't worry.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.055
I used to have a pet tarantula,

15:24.057 --> 15:25.523
and they're completely harmless.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.091
And sometimes really cute.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.127
UH, I don't see it.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.929
Maybe it crawled onto you.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.031
Ah, get off, get off, get off!

15:33.033 --> 15:34.999
Tess, Tess! Tess, Tess!

15:35.001 --> 15:37.702
There's no spider. You just imagined it.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.938
Right, yeah, probably.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.806
Mmm, no spiders.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.008
Oh, it's too bad. I really love...

15:44.010 --> 15:45.977
Whoa! Okay!

15:45.979 --> 15:47.312
Uh, keep that away from me!

15:47.314 --> 15:49.747
Get it off, get it off,
get it off, get it off!

15:51.685 --> 15:54.285
A lady bug? Really?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.621
Wait, is that what
scared you at The Relatives'?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.957
So you love rats

15:58.959 --> 15:59.958
and had a pet tarantula,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.125
but you're afraid of ladybugs?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.560
No, it just...

16:02.562 --> 16:04.329
It just surprised me.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.130
Oh, no, I totally understand.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.232
They're so vicious
with their giant wings

16:08.234 --> 16:09.901
and their black spots on their back.

16:09.903 --> 16:11.235
Oh, yeah, and they're
always looking at you

16:11.237 --> 16:13.538
with those evil ladybug eyes.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.840
All right, enough talk about ladybugs,

16:15.842 --> 16:19.477
Let's get back inside
so we can talk the plan over.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.212
Please be careful with that!

16:21.214 --> 16:24.048
- Ready?
- Not quite.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.717
We still need to figure out a way

16:25.719 --> 16:27.485
to get Lucia to leave her house

16:27.487 --> 16:28.820
before we go in.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.123
Ahh, oh, right. Okay.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.026
What if we call Lucia
pretending to be firemen

16:35.028 --> 16:36.627
and tell her house is on fire.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.764
Um... usually when there's a fire,

16:39.766 --> 16:41.032
you call the fire department.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.166
They don't call you.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.535
Yeah, that's a good point.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.504
What if we dress up
like people from pest control

16:46.506 --> 16:49.007
and tell her her house is contaminated?

16:49.009 --> 16:52.110
- With ladybugs?
- Ha ha.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.878
No, cockroaches or rats or...

16:53.880 --> 16:55.246
I don't think she's
gonna believe two boys

16:55.248 --> 16:57.081
telling her they're from pest control.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.083
Ugh.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.285
Mmm.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.688
Well, what if we send
Lucy a fake message

17:03.690 --> 17:05.823
saying that we found a secret vault,

17:05.825 --> 17:08.459
and it belongs to William Rybosh,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.362
and that his whole fortune
is being kept there, hmm?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.400
Yeah, you're right. That's...

17:15.402 --> 17:17.268
- A brilliant plan!
- A brilliant plan!

17:20.373 --> 17:24.409
I was going to tell you
about my hero, Amelia Earhart,

17:24.411 --> 17:26.877
but I've an even better
hero to tell you about.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.746
In fact, I think she might be

17:28.748 --> 17:30.381
the biggest hero I know.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.784
Her name is Evie,
and she's my new sister.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.385
And she loves puppies.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.988
And playing hide and seek.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.289
It's not easy going to live

17:38.291 --> 17:40.658
with a bunch of people you've never met.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.994
Especially when you're as young as Evie.

17:42.996 --> 17:45.329
I'm almost as old as all of you.

17:45.331 --> 17:47.899
You are.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.967
But Evie is acing it.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.869
She already feels
like part of the family,

17:51.871 --> 17:53.538
and even though she just moved in,

17:53.540 --> 17:55.506
I can't imagine not having
her as my little sister.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.588
Reverse Heist
is gonna be hard.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.557
A lot harder than when we
planted the vase.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.459
We're gonna have to avoid
guards and cameras.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.361
So, uh, yeah, let's get
started with step one.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.897
Tess and Sal climb into the dumpster.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.933
Still not loving step one.

18:21.935 --> 18:23.267
Oh, don't forget to take pictures.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.169
Dumpster selfies are
really in right now.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.904
Oh!

18:26.906 --> 18:29.574
I made an estimate based on the distance

18:29.576 --> 18:30.975
from the street to the house

18:30.977 --> 18:32.810
in comparison with our maximum speed,

18:32.812 --> 18:34.078
weight of the dumpster,

18:34.080 --> 18:35.847
and possible weather conditions.

18:35.849 --> 18:37.215
And?

18:37.217 --> 18:38.850
It will take us approximately

18:38.852 --> 18:40.918
three minutes and 26 seconds.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.854
Important fact for our time frame, okay.

18:42.856 --> 18:46.023
Um, so if you practice a big more, um,

18:46.025 --> 18:49.961
maybe you could get that down
to, let's say, 2:30?

18:49.963 --> 18:51.896
Great!

18:54.167 --> 18:56.033
Stop!

18:56.035 --> 18:58.169
2:53. Again.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.704
Aww!

18:59.706 --> 19:02.773
Now, step two... You're gonna need cover

19:02.775 --> 19:04.242
in case a guard looks
inside the dumpster.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.810
Sal, that's where you come in

19:05.812 --> 19:08.880
with and ingenious garbage blanket.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.948
I'm loving step two even less.

19:10.950 --> 19:14.785
It's fake garbage, Tess. 100% odor-free.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.288
Yeah, now for strep three.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.323
Tess makes a fake call to Lucia

19:19.325 --> 19:21.259
pretending to be
her lawyer's receptionist.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.060
One Lucia takes the bait,

19:23.062 --> 19:25.796
I'll follow her, then you guys
know her whereabouts.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.132
Step three is definitely
my least favorite.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.534
Yeah.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.302
Now, once you're out of sight,

19:31.304 --> 19:33.237
the most important
part of the plan kicks in.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.806
So listen very carefully.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.242
When the guards leave,
get out of the dumpster

19:38.244 --> 19:40.077
and get into house.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.713
You will disable the security cameras

19:42.715 --> 19:45.016
and you will steal the fake vase,

19:45.018 --> 19:48.052
and straight away get out of the house.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.188
Climb back into the dumpster
and call me.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.622
Fingers crossed Lucia doesn't know

19:51.624 --> 19:53.224
that she's being tricked, ahem!

19:53.226 --> 19:54.926
Then move the dumpster back,
and I'll switch it

19:54.928 --> 19:56.160
with the real dumpster,

19:56.162 --> 19:58.863
and then boom, mission accomplished.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.699
Wait, say the last part again?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.502
Boom... It's kind of like
a heist catchphrase.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.237
No, before that.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.207
The part about Lucia
finding out she was tricked.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.242
What are you gonna do
if she does figure it out?

20:11.244 --> 20:14.145
I'm still kind of working on that part.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.980
Oh, fantastic.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.115
All right, after we do
all the dangerous stuff,

20:18.117 --> 20:19.784
we could end up stuck there!

20:19.786 --> 20:21.619
I'll think of something.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.022
And it's only if she finds
you before you finish,

20:25.024 --> 20:26.524
so it's really down to you.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.327
Remind me why do we
have to take the risk

20:29.329 --> 20:31.329
and you get to hang back safe and sound?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.064
Because it's my plan.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.766
And anyone who knows
anything about real heists

20:35.768 --> 20:37.668
knows that the person
who comes up with the plan

20:37.670 --> 20:40.605
doesn't do the dangerous stuff.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.941
Unless, of course, you guys
can come up with a better plan?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.811
Can I draw the steps on my plan?

20:46.813 --> 20:49.680
Well, I didn't really...

20:51.818 --> 20:53.484
Step one, we bake a huge cake.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.219
Step two, we put Evie in the cake.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.788
Step three, we send the cake to Lucia.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.557
Step 4, Evie steals the vase back

20:59.559 --> 21:01.125
and brings the vase
and the cake back to us

21:01.127 --> 21:05.096
so we can eat it.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.598
That's a terrible idea.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.468
He means that it would be a waste

21:10.470 --> 21:12.703
of a perfectly good cake,
and that would be a shame.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.938
Good point.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.239
We should probably just bake a cake here

21:15.241 --> 21:16.374
- so we can eat it together.
- Great.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.209
All right, great. Now back to my plan?

21:18.211 --> 21:20.378
Yeah, okay.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.481
See you later, yeah.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.449
Any questions?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.319
No, didn't think so.
This can't go wrong, okay?

21:28.321 --> 21:29.987
Oh, please don't say that.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.322
Whenever somebody says that,
