01:33.750 --> 01:36.790
Young man, time to wake up!

01:36.875 --> 01:40.582
You're sleeping while I'm teaching?

01:41.125 --> 01:42.499
Ah!

01:44.791 --> 01:46.290
Knock it off.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.540
Why's your thing beeping?

01:49.500 --> 01:52.999
This "thing" is a mobile phone.

01:53.083 --> 01:54.999
Look at you. Tap, tap, tap.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.165
Only your phones.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.540
Nobody reads anymore.

01:58.125 --> 02:02.165
Teaching you history
is like playing piano to a cow.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.749
Now, let me show you something.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.040
It's a book.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.374
A what?

02:07.458 --> 02:07.957
Look.

02:08.041 --> 02:08.874
Wow, that's a big book.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.539
Only $2,000.

02:10.625 --> 02:11.749
$2,000?

02:11.833 --> 02:13.249
Too expensive.

02:13.333 --> 02:19.207
It's all about boy meets girl.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.915
A boy, and a girl, right?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.082
Yeah.

02:26.166 --> 02:29.290
Birds and bees, they do it, right?

02:30.833 --> 02:32.749
He takes off his clothes, right?

02:34.083 --> 02:36.040
And she takes off hers, right?

02:38.458 --> 02:39.874
Too much bother.

02:40.833 --> 02:42.832
Two total strangers at the bus stop,

02:42.916 --> 02:43.665
right?

02:44.166 --> 02:46.415
What about that?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.165
What do you say?

02:48.250 --> 02:49.790
That's crazy.

02:49.875 --> 02:51.999
What? Girls get knocked up just like that?

02:52.083 --> 02:54.790
Just like that!

02:54.875 --> 02:57.749
Where do babies come from?

02:58.666 --> 03:00.249
Let me look at the book.

03:00.583 --> 03:01.749
Quick.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.415
What are you doing here?

03:09.375 --> 03:11.415
What's history got to do with me?

03:11.500 --> 03:12.874
Come again?

03:12.958 --> 03:15.249
Where would you be now without history?

03:15.333 --> 03:17.665
A special price for us, Professor?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.165
No way. $2,000.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.874
Not a penny less.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.040
Professor Pig!

03:24.125 --> 03:25.624
Pardon?

03:26.083 --> 03:27.374
Professor P.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.540
Professor P.

03:30.458 --> 03:31.540
Stop messing around.

03:38.666 --> 03:39.915
Wait! Jack!

03:42.875 --> 03:43.790
What's up?

03:54.041 --> 03:55.540
The clock stopped?

04:07.458 --> 04:08.665
He is the one?

04:15.250 --> 04:17.832
Hi, I'm Jack, your lucky star.

04:17.916 --> 04:20.790
Forward the message to ten friends

04:20.875 --> 04:22.957
and you'll have all the luck you need.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.374
But, if you don't...

04:25.458 --> 04:27.665
Don't blame anyone but yourself.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.249
Now, flash mob!

04:30.750 --> 04:31.624
Ok?

04:34.833 --> 04:37.165
Teddy do you love me?

04:37.625 --> 04:38.624
Idiot.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.665
Stop that.

04:46.166 --> 04:46.915
Let me have a go.

04:48.958 --> 04:49.832
Let me have a go.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.915
12:00, Taiwan time.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.624
Happy birthday!

05:33.083 --> 05:34.457
Smile!

05:40.583 --> 05:42.249
It wasn't me.

05:42.875 --> 05:43.915
Jack.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.874
I've met someone else.

05:46.958 --> 05:47.665
Who?

05:49.500 --> 05:51.540
You don't care about me.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.249
You don't know what "true love" is.

05:55.416 --> 05:56.415
But I do.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.665
Hey, what are you...

06:03.166 --> 06:04.749
Hey, hands off.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.832
She's got asthma.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.207
Asthma.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.874
She hates fluffy toys like this.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.290
She's allergic to them, OK?

06:23.458 --> 06:25.499
Take a photo!

06:29.125 --> 06:30.415
Hey, Jack.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.999
Call yourself a lucky star?

06:33.083 --> 06:34.832
What's wrong with you and girls?

06:36.208 --> 06:37.249
I...

06:38.291 --> 06:39.540
How would I know?

06:50.125 --> 06:51.124
Jack.

06:53.291 --> 06:54.499
Sorry.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.832
Mummy is sorry, mummy has to go.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.624
You must remember.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.749
Not to fall for anyone.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.957
Don't believe in love.

07:10.958 --> 07:13.332
Love is the deadliest poison ever.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.499
Just wait till mummy finishes these

07:20.875 --> 07:22.790
and then mummy will go to sleep.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.582
Mummy, don't die.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.624
Sorry.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.207
Mum?

07:29.291 --> 07:30.540
I'm sorry, baby.

07:30.625 --> 07:33.415
Why don't you save her?

07:33.750 --> 07:35.999
Dad, help mum!

07:36.083 --> 07:36.957
Sorry.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.082
Sorry.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.749
Mum.

08:02.708 --> 08:03.790
It's alright.

08:05.291 --> 08:06.374
I'm fine.

08:35.666 --> 08:37.499
Professor Pig says,

08:37.582 --> 08:39.749
If you don't show up for the TTT tour,

08:39.832 --> 08:42.832
he'll fail you. >>.<<

09:01.916 --> 09:05.457
Taipei, TTT wharf, 2014.

09:05.541 --> 09:07.415
Our first stop today,

09:07.500 --> 09:09.165
is the City God Temple.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.332
The history is not the main thing.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.499
People actually come here
for the matchmaking god.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.249
Matchmaking God?

09:15.083 --> 09:16.124
Jack.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.665
Just what you need, Jack!

09:17.750 --> 09:18.540
Exactly!

09:18.625 --> 09:20.082
You've just been dumped.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.124
"True love", remember?

09:22.208 --> 09:23.624
Asthma, eh?

09:26.166 --> 09:29.207
You think that's funny?

09:34.250 --> 09:35.499
Please tell me

09:35.583 --> 09:38.249
what "true love" is.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.165
Come along everyone...

09:41.250 --> 09:44.040
Look at the water dungeon.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.165
A very famous person
was once imprisoned here.

09:47.250 --> 09:51.665
Dr. Chiang,
known as the founding father of Taiwan.

09:51.750 --> 09:55.249
I've got here an article by Dr. Chiang.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.374
Can someone tell me the title?

09:57.458 --> 09:57.957
"A Note from Park."

09:58.041 --> 09:58.790
"A Note from Pool."

09:59.750 --> 10:02.290
Can anyone actually read?

10:02.625 --> 10:04.290
"A Note from Prison."

10:06.083 --> 10:08.165
The flower of youth is...

10:12.458 --> 10:13.207
Can we go now? Miss?

10:13.291 --> 10:16.540
No yet. I'm gonna tell you
about the water dungeon.

10:16.625 --> 10:19.374
Oh Miss, they all look the same.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.999
The water dungeon,
as you might have guessed...

10:28.750 --> 10:31.040
You two, get out!

10:31.125 --> 10:32.415
What do you think you're doing?

10:36.708 --> 10:38.790
Knock it off, guys.

10:38.875 --> 10:40.457
Here's your commemorative coin.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.790
Come get yours.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.332
Just give me a 10-dollar coin in return.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.207
Issued in 2010.

10:48.291 --> 10:50.832
With Dr. Chiang's portrait on it.

10:57.625 --> 11:01.124
These are Taiwanese artworks
from the '20s to the '60s.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.957
We'll start here.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.374
Follow me, please.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.457
Come on, we're almost done.

11:08.541 --> 11:09.499
Stop messing around.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.582
Keep your voice down.

11:11.916 --> 11:14.540
Right, we finally come to

11:14.625 --> 11:17.290
the last part of the TTT tour.

11:17.458 --> 11:18.290
Come on.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.749
Let's do a roll call.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.207
Another $100 each.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.165
$100?

11:22.250 --> 11:23.582
Why do we need to pay again?

11:23.666 --> 11:25.124
Didn't we pay already?

11:25.208 --> 11:26.207
Professor P.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.165
Now, pay attention.

11:28.250 --> 11:31.707
This is "South Street Festival".

11:32.250 --> 11:36.165
This is TTT 100 years ago.

11:36.458 --> 11:41.165
It takes you back in time.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.790
Open any door

11:43.875 --> 11:46.124
and you're back
in the Japanese colonial period.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.999
"Call girl" period?

11:51.458 --> 11:52.665
Don't be stupid.

11:52.833 --> 11:55.749
Why do I bother telling you about history.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.790
It's a total waste of time.

11:58.041 --> 11:59.499
Says who?

11:59.583 --> 12:01.665
Yeah, why do you say that?

12:02.208 --> 12:03.665
We all want to be somebody.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.749
Yeah, like all the time.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.082
Good, I hear you.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.207
Great.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.165
Here.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.332
You do it.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.665
Thought you said no photos here?

12:25.750 --> 12:26.999
You're ok.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.499
Whatever.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.207
Who called my name?

12:45.291 --> 12:45.915
Somebody called you?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.249
Look over there.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.332
That handsome guy.

12:50.416 --> 12:51.374
I like him.

12:51.458 --> 12:52.832
I heard him called me.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.499
Hey hottie...

12:56.541 --> 12:59.124
I saw him in my dream.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.374
Let's get to the temple.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.665
Alright...

13:02.750 --> 13:06.665
City God, please help me find a husband.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.207
"Taipei 101, the tallest building in the world."

14:01.291 --> 14:03.582
"It's the opening ceremony today."

14:04.750 --> 14:06.915
"The typhoon is now at its strongest..."

14:10.041 --> 14:10.749
"Yes, over to you."

14:10.833 --> 14:12.040
"Right now, I'm in

14:12.125 --> 14:13.790
downtown Hua-Lian."

14:14.083 --> 14:16.249
"The typhoon Nally is currently..."

14:19.250 --> 14:20.957
"Chinese Taipei is now batting"

14:21.333 --> 14:22.165
"Look at that!"

14:22.250 --> 14:24.290
"That's a home run that I've never seen"

14:24.666 --> 14:27.457
<(Singing) Oh, nothing can stop us...>

14:30.333 --> 14:32.749
<Oh, let's move on.>

14:32.833 --> 14:36.249
"The first 7-11 in Taiwan..."

14:36.666 --> 14:41.624
"One small step for man, one giant leap..."

14:43.250 --> 14:44.124
"Home run!"

14:44.208 --> 14:47.540
"Little League of Taiwan,
first World Championship in 1955."

14:49.500 --> 14:52.707
"National Day Ceremony"

14:54.083 --> 14:55.707
"The 15th of August

14:55.791 --> 14:58.915
the Japanese surrendered in 1945..."

15:11.083 --> 15:12.457
He is the one!

16:04.166 --> 16:06.165
Hey, young man.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.332
Hurry up.

16:07.416 --> 16:08.957
Or we'll all be in trouble!

16:09.041 --> 16:10.165
Didn't I tell you to

16:10.250 --> 16:11.374
take care of him.

16:11.458 --> 16:12.540
I did take care of him.

16:12.625 --> 16:13.374
Where's he now?

16:13.458 --> 16:14.207
It's too late now.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.540
I'm gonna be in trouble.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.249
Hurry, find him.

16:16.333 --> 16:16.874
Black?

16:19.875 --> 16:20.999
This must be him,

16:21.083 --> 16:21.790
Hurry.

16:21.875 --> 16:22.957
We're gonna be late.
- What?

16:23.041 --> 16:24.332
Hurry.
- What?

16:26.666 --> 16:29.540
This young man is no ordinary fellow.

16:45.541 --> 16:46.790
Excuse me.

16:46.875 --> 16:47.915
Where are we going?

16:49.625 --> 16:51.790
Watch out,

16:52.166 --> 16:55.124
here comes City God!

17:01.416 --> 17:03.540
Make way for City God!

17:20.375 --> 17:21.249
Hey, you.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.499
What's going on?

17:24.833 --> 17:25.832
Hang on.

17:27.540 --> 17:28.624
Mr. Lin's shop?

17:28.708 --> 17:30.582
No idea. It's just how it is.

17:30.958 --> 17:31.582
This won't do.

17:31.666 --> 17:33.040
What if Ms Ginger sees this?

17:33.416 --> 17:35.165
Mr. Lin is rich. It's just business.

17:35.250 --> 17:36.165
Just hurry up.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.540
No!

17:37.625 --> 17:38.957
Put this on.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.707
What are you doing?

17:49.791 --> 17:50.749
Tell me what's going on!

17:50.875 --> 17:52.415
Stop it, all of you!

17:56.416 --> 17:58.457
What are you doing? Hurry!

18:01.583 --> 18:02.582
Where are you going?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.040
Something's not quite right.

18:08.541 --> 18:12.665
Probably a new move,
for the special occasion.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.624
The new lion dance.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.207
"Drunken lion."

18:22.500 --> 18:24.749
Where are you going?

18:33.083 --> 18:34.207
"Mr. Lin's fabric store"

18:42.000 --> 18:43.499
Sir, you alright?

18:43.833 --> 18:44.832
Fine, fine.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.374
Go clean it up.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.165
Hey, you...

18:54.750 --> 18:55.999
Who started this?

18:58.291 --> 19:00.124
"Ginger's fabric store"

19:00.666 --> 19:01.624
Who...

19:03.708 --> 19:06.207
dares to lay a finger on Ginger's boys?

19:24.666 --> 19:26.665
Ms Ginger!

19:31.666 --> 19:34.707
Leave it to me.

19:38.875 --> 19:39.749
Mum?

19:53.166 --> 19:54.790
Who are you calling mum?

19:54.875 --> 19:56.249
How old do you think I am?

19:58.625 --> 20:00.207
Tell me.

20:01.541 --> 20:03.207
Who's giving you a hard time?

20:03.958 --> 20:04.957
Him.

20:06.916 --> 20:08.790
Stop pointing,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.957
or I'll have your finger chopped off.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.707
Yeah, chopped off.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.207
Chopped off?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.249
Mr. Lin.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.665
Whatever it is,

20:30.750 --> 20:32.665
I'll deal with it.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.749
How are you going to deal with it?

20:39.625 --> 20:40.624
Ginger.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.707
I didn't open a new store here

20:43.666 --> 20:45.582
to compete with yours.

20:45.666 --> 20:46.707
Mr. Lin.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.540
How would my tiny little tailor shop

20:49.625 --> 20:52.665
ever compete against your grand store?

20:53.500 --> 20:56.040
Let me just ask you though.

20:57.458 --> 21:00.290
God, she know nothing about our slang!

21:00.625 --> 21:03.707
Yo man, you know
how much fabric you need

21:03.791 --> 21:05.707
to make a dress?

21:07.375 --> 21:09.915
What about a kimono? Dude?

21:13.166 --> 21:14.165
No?

21:14.833 --> 21:16.624
No?

21:18.291 --> 21:19.707
No?

21:20.125 --> 21:22.290
Call yourself a professional?

21:25.125 --> 21:27.582
Don't worry though, my shop

21:27.666 --> 21:30.249
right across the street

21:31.666 --> 21:33.582
will never be competition.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.624
Even better, I might

21:36.708 --> 21:38.707
send some customers your way.

21:38.791 --> 21:39.749
Alright? Man?

21:44.708 --> 21:46.457
What... is she talking about?

21:48.125 --> 21:49.749
Honestly, sir,

21:50.166 --> 21:51.874
that accent of hers...

21:51.958 --> 21:52.957
is driving me crazy, too.

21:59.250 --> 21:59.999
And let me tell you.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.082
Your boys will have to be

22:02.166 --> 22:04.374
responsible for the mess today

22:04.750 --> 22:07.749
or I'm going to have them all arrested!

22:09.791 --> 22:10.332
Hey.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.874
How can you say that?

22:13.625 --> 22:15.082
My woman's in danger.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.582
Catch it if you can.

22:24.750 --> 22:25.999
Catch it if you can.

22:27.375 --> 22:28.457
Catch it!

22:31.541 --> 22:34.082
Catch it, it's our chicken!

22:39.041 --> 22:40.207
Pro... Professor P?

22:40.291 --> 22:41.415
No, no. Go away.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.207
It is Professor P.

22:42.291 --> 22:42.874
No, I'm not.

22:42.958 --> 22:43.915
Professor P!

22:47.666 --> 22:48.415
Pro...

22:48.500 --> 22:50.332
Professor P!
- I'm not Professor P.

22:50.916 --> 22:51.665
Make way.
- Come back.

22:51.750 --> 22:52.707
Look, there's a pretty girl.

22:53.500 --> 22:54.332
Look, I have money.

23:06.291 --> 23:09.040
Come try the flour tea.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.749
Come try the flour tea, young man.

23:33.833 --> 23:35.374
It's delicious.

23:35.458 --> 23:36.790
Have some.

23:41.750 --> 23:42.957
What is this?

23:43.666 --> 23:44.749
Where am I?

23:47.625 --> 23:49.249
Where's my motorbike?

23:54.916 --> 23:56.874
Black, where am I?

23:56.958 --> 23:58.499
What year is this?

23:59.041 --> 24:00.582
It's the 1920's!

24:40.750 --> 24:41.915
Just woke up?

24:48.416 --> 24:49.790
You're from Beijing?

24:50.791 --> 24:52.040
Whereabouts in Beijing?

24:55.166 --> 24:56.040
Mum?

24:57.833 --> 25:00.624
How come you haven't changed?

25:03.333 --> 25:04.290
Stop calling me mum.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.082
How old do you think I am?

25:08.958 --> 25:10.415
Yesterday, if it weren't for Ms Ginger

25:10.500 --> 25:11.999
a new kid like you...

25:12.083 --> 25:13.749
They would have beaten

25:16.375 --> 25:18.874
the HELL out of you.

25:19.958 --> 25:20.957
That's awesome!

25:21.041 --> 25:23.290
Great pronunciation!

25:35.416 --> 25:36.457
There you go.

25:38.458 --> 25:39.332
Thank you.

25:41.958 --> 25:42.957
5 cents.

25:43.875 --> 25:44.624
What?

25:44.708 --> 25:45.582
5 cents.

25:45.666 --> 25:46.499
Only 5 cents?

25:46.583 --> 25:47.707
Me too, me too!

25:48.833 --> 25:49.749
Get lost.

25:49.833 --> 25:51.957
You get lost.

25:52.041 --> 25:53.582
Let's see what he's got.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.082
Check it out. How does it look?

25:56.166 --> 25:59.124
As poor as a church mouse.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.374
Is it good looking?

26:01.500 --> 26:02.290
What's that?

26:02.583 --> 26:03.457
What's this?

26:03.541 --> 26:05.790
What does it say?

26:05.875 --> 26:06.999
Peace to the world.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.082
Get off your arse and get busy then.

26:13.666 --> 26:14.582
Get off your arse.

26:14.666 --> 26:15.332
Yeah, get off your arse

26:15.416 --> 26:17.124
Enough,

26:17.958 --> 26:20.124
you two big lumps stop getting in my way.

26:20.208 --> 26:22.540
You're the big lump.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.457
What's your name?

26:24.541 --> 26:25.457
I...

26:27.125 --> 26:28.332
Jack Chen.

26:28.916 --> 26:30.290
Jack.

26:34.708 --> 26:36.040
Jack it is then.

26:43.625 --> 26:44.624
Jack.

26:46.583 --> 26:48.290
You just stay here.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.832
Excuse me.

26:49.916 --> 26:51.124
Good morning.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.207
Red bean soup, very sweet.

26:54.291 --> 26:55.207
Try some.

26:57.250 --> 26:59.124
Wanna try some?

26:59.208 --> 27:00.415
Fresh bananas!

27:00.500 --> 27:03.374
Would you like to try?

27:03.458 --> 27:04.790
Oranges?

27:04.875 --> 27:05.540
Flour Tea.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.874
Come try the delicious flour tea.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.707
Buy one get one free.

27:13.750 --> 27:14.707
Jack.

27:14.791 --> 27:15.540
There he is.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.290
Hey Jack!

27:17.375 --> 27:18.332
Bravo, Jack.

27:18.416 --> 27:20.582
What you did yesterday was brilliant!

27:20.666 --> 27:22.124
That should teach them a lesson.

27:22.208 --> 27:22.832
Yeah.

27:22.916 --> 27:23.790
Brilliant!

27:25.291 --> 27:26.540
Don't you remember me at all?

27:28.083 --> 27:28.707
He was saying...

27:29.833 --> 27:31.999
Well well, look who it is.

27:34.333 --> 27:36.290
Gosh, your hair stinks.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.540
What's that on your hair?

27:38.625 --> 27:39.832
Hair shit?

27:46.041 --> 27:48.082
So, you're Ms Ginger's son?

27:49.125 --> 27:51.832
My father's imported lots of fabric recently.

27:52.458 --> 27:53.749
Tell your mother to

27:54.750 --> 27:58.082
come and see if she wants to buy some.

28:02.625 --> 28:03.999
Mind your own business.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.290
We can take care of ourselves.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.165
Just you wait, very soon we'll be

28:09.250 --> 28:10.457
beating the crap out of you.

28:10.541 --> 28:12.124
Yeah, all of you.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.582
What makes you think you can do that?

28:16.958 --> 28:18.499
We've got Master Pig.

28:19.166 --> 28:21.082
Master PIG?

28:24.083 --> 28:25.790
Get your hands off me.

28:25.875 --> 28:28.582
You pervert.

28:28.666 --> 28:29.957
I'm not a pervert.

28:30.041 --> 28:30.582
Says you.

28:30.666 --> 28:32.457
I was just doing my job.

28:32.541 --> 28:34.290
It's just the way you do it.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.790
One hand here,

28:36.875 --> 28:38.874
The other here, and hold firm.

28:38.958 --> 28:40.540
So...
- That's how we do it.

28:41.666 --> 28:42.207
I mean it.

28:42.291 --> 28:45.082
Just want to make sure it's the right size.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.582
What are you up to now?

28:48.041 --> 28:49.499
Nothing,
I was just taking her measurements.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.415
Pervert!

28:52.500 --> 28:54.082
There you are.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.624
I need you to cut this for me.

28:56.541 --> 28:57.582
And give us a discount, eh?

28:57.666 --> 28:59.040
That new store across the street?

28:59.125 --> 29:01.207
They're giving away freebies.

29:01.291 --> 29:02.957
War, is it?

29:03.250 --> 29:04.207
So be it.

29:04.291 --> 29:05.624
Buy one get one free.

29:05.875 --> 29:07.582
We can do that, too.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.249
Great, there you go.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.582
No need to take your measurements.

29:12.666 --> 29:14.082
No need for a gentleman like you.

29:14.166 --> 29:16.165
I only take measurements for ladies.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.457
Ladies eh?

29:17.541 --> 29:19.915
Honey, come this way!

29:20.458 --> 29:21.165
Your wife is here, too?

29:21.250 --> 29:22.290
Of course.

29:23.541 --> 29:24.790
Oh no.

29:25.666 --> 29:27.124
Thought you were going to...?

29:28.416 --> 29:29.832
No, no, no need for that.

29:30.416 --> 29:31.374
In you go, honey.

29:31.458 --> 29:32.957
No, really.

29:34.083 --> 29:35.290
Cut the crap, just do it.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.499
No need, really.

29:37.583 --> 29:40.040
Not necessary, really.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.624
That pervert is crazy.
You should give me a freebie.

29:44.708 --> 29:45.957
You can measure me then.

29:46.916 --> 29:49.374
Aren't you sweet.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.249
Come on, let's go home.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.332
We'll come for the dress tomorrow.

29:56.416 --> 29:57.665
Won't be ready tomorrow.

29:57.916 --> 29:58.915
How so?

29:59.458 --> 30:02.124
Need to order more fabric.

30:02.208 --> 30:03.665
Why?

30:03.750 --> 30:06.082
Hey, that's not right.
- Is he saying I'm fat?

30:06.375 --> 30:08.749
It took you ages to take my measurements.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.124
How did he take your measurements?

30:12.208 --> 30:12.832
He did this...

30:12.916 --> 30:15.040
I told him to hold firm.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.124
Professor P.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.832
Professor Pig!

30:22.333 --> 30:23.207
Watch your mouth.

30:23.291 --> 30:25.082
Not Professor Pig.

30:25.833 --> 30:26.957
Professor P.

30:28.916 --> 30:30.790
I knew it, you brought me here.

30:30.875 --> 30:31.957
Now you send me back.

30:32.041 --> 30:33.207
I'm not staying here.

30:33.291 --> 30:33.749
Quick.

30:41.041 --> 30:43.207
Stop this.
What's wrong with everyone today.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.874
(Japanese) Stop this.

30:48.708 --> 30:49.957
No fighting.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.124
How could you hit her?

30:58.500 --> 31:00.457
(Japanese) They're just having a laugh.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.332
You Taiwanese, no law and order!

31:04.750 --> 31:05.957
I'm really sorry.

31:06.041 --> 31:06.790
Inspector.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.624
Please excuse us, Inspector.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.290
You, just take care of the shop!

31:10.625 --> 31:11.790
No more trouble!

31:12.708 --> 31:13.749
Yes.

31:14.583 --> 31:15.624
I'm really sorry.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.290
Go help him.

31:19.333 --> 31:21.999
Here, let them help.

31:22.625 --> 31:23.624
Sorry about that.

31:24.541 --> 31:25.749
Your fault.

31:26.416 --> 31:27.332
YOUR fault.

31:28.166 --> 31:29.624
"Come here, everyone!"

31:29.708 --> 31:34.290
"Master Pig
and the Twa-Tiu-Tiann theatre present

31:34.375 --> 31:36.124
a joint performance
with the Shanghai Theatre."

31:36.208 --> 31:40.040
"The Lady of the Camellias"

31:40.916 --> 31:42.790
Just do me one favour first.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.165
And I'll tell you about time travel

31:45.500 --> 31:47.082
when I'm able to.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.582
Just tell me now!

31:48.666 --> 31:49.582
Where are we now?

31:49.666 --> 31:50.957
Geisha!

31:52.583 --> 31:53.707
Master Pig!

31:53.791 --> 31:54.957
Bad news!

31:55.041 --> 31:57.874
Two actors can't make it today

31:57.958 --> 31:59.707
Tummy flu.

31:59.791 --> 32:01.540
But we're about to start.

32:01.625 --> 32:03.790
You, get up there.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.040
Up there?

32:05.125 --> 32:06.707
What about the storyteller?

32:06.791 --> 32:07.749
The storyteller...

32:07.833 --> 32:08.957
I'll do it.

32:09.375 --> 32:10.665
But I can't act.

32:10.750 --> 32:13.290
Just do what I say.

32:17.458 --> 32:18.457
Which part?

32:18.541 --> 32:20.082
The Tree.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.749
The Tree?

32:45.500 --> 32:46.374
Rose.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.999
You've come to see the show today.

32:49.083 --> 32:49.874
Checking out girls?

32:49.958 --> 32:51.707
Which one do you like?

32:52.333 --> 32:53.249
Rose.

32:56.833 --> 32:58.207
Let's take our seats.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.915
Which one do you fancy?

33:02.416 --> 33:03.874
The one wearing pink...

33:03.958 --> 33:05.332
Which colour?

33:05.416 --> 33:06.415
Come again?

33:06.916 --> 33:08.957
The old woman wearing pink...

33:09.875 --> 33:10.707
Come here.

33:11.958 --> 33:13.040
You play the tree.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.332
What tree?

33:14.416 --> 33:15.749
You play the tree.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.707
Hey, what tree?

33:18.791 --> 33:19.790
You guys get ready! Hurry!

33:19.875 --> 33:21.915
I always play the main role,
you're making me play a tree?

33:27.000 --> 33:30.332
(Recites poem)

33:34.250 --> 33:37.582
A lady of the night falls
for a wealthy young man

33:38.250 --> 33:41.582
but their dream
was soon ruined by cruel reality

33:41.666 --> 33:45.457
Our heroine is mortally ill.

33:45.541 --> 33:47.999
Anna, where are you taking me?

33:48.083 --> 33:49.499
I'm taking you to plant these flowers.

33:49.583 --> 33:50.874
You're going to do that, right?

33:51.375 --> 33:53.624
Not like that, Anna.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.082
Give them to him.

33:56.375 --> 33:57.665
Give them to him.

33:59.625 --> 34:01.124
Like this? To him, right?

34:01.208 --> 34:05.790
Why don't you listen to me?

34:05.875 --> 34:07.665
Anna?

34:07.750 --> 34:08.956
Who's Anna?

34:10.916 --> 34:14.123
I'm afraid, Anna thinks I'm unworthy of you.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.498
She wants me to give up.

34:18.125 --> 34:19.748
It must be in the script.

34:19.833 --> 34:20.748
It has to be.

34:20.833 --> 34:23.623
I know, but someone's torn some pages out.

34:23.708 --> 34:24.706
Keep looking.

34:24.791 --> 34:27.540
Someone was probably desperate
for toilet paper.

34:30.541 --> 34:31.290
Whose kid is that?

34:31.375 --> 34:34.290
He can't run around with no pants on.

34:34.875 --> 34:38.415
I really am going to faint.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.956
I'm Armand.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.290
He's calling for her now.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.373
I've got the flowers.

34:49.750 --> 34:51.831
I've got the flowers.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.790
I've got the flowers.

34:53.875 --> 34:57.457
Thank you tree fairy, but no need now.

34:58.666 --> 34:59.957
Come on, we don't need flowers now.

35:00.041 --> 35:01.457
Just kiss her!

35:02.125 --> 35:03.332
Stop it.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.249
Do you know anything about theatre?

35:08.333 --> 35:09.790
What do you think you're doing?

35:10.083 --> 35:11.290
Just do your job.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.499
Why are you giving me a hard time?

35:12.583 --> 35:14.957
This is a romantic tragedy.

35:15.041 --> 35:16.082
Why's the audience laughing?

35:16.166 --> 35:17.332
Yeah, why?

35:17.416 --> 35:20.499
Watch your mouth. You're the male lead.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.332
Damn you.

35:25.416 --> 35:27.999
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

35:28.083 --> 35:28.915
What now?

35:45.625 --> 35:46.790
(Japanese) Stop clapping.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.415
Everyone go home now.

35:52.500 --> 35:55.374
The show's over.

35:55.583 --> 35:58.999
The Crown Prince will soon
be visiting Taiwan.

35:59.833 --> 36:01.040
From now on,

36:01.375 --> 36:04.082
all non-Japanese plays

36:04.958 --> 36:08.707
are banned.

36:12.625 --> 36:13.832
This is outrageous.

36:14.625 --> 36:17.540
What kind of rule is that?

36:18.166 --> 36:22.290
Are you sure this comes from the top?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.874
What are you talking about?

36:26.125 --> 36:27.707
Only Japanese songs?

36:27.791 --> 36:29.207
No Taiwanese plays?

36:29.291 --> 36:30.999
This is not fair!

36:34.916 --> 36:35.749
You can't do this!

36:35.833 --> 36:38.457
You can't just walk in
and stop our play like this.

36:39.958 --> 36:42.540
No way.

36:43.875 --> 36:46.999
Right, I know what you want.

36:47.541 --> 36:49.082
No Taiwanese plays from now on.

36:50.500 --> 36:54.540
There you go.

37:03.291 --> 37:04.165
Come in.

37:13.833 --> 37:16.124
Isn't that what you wanted?

37:16.375 --> 37:17.207
Don't do this.

37:17.291 --> 37:19.374
I'm too young to die, please.

37:24.916 --> 37:26.165
Scared now?

37:26.500 --> 37:27.832
Scared to death!

37:28.083 --> 37:29.790
You useless prick.

37:31.541 --> 37:36.082
Your cheap little trick won't work on me.

37:36.541 --> 37:38.707
I don't understand a word you're saying.

37:48.333 --> 37:54.457
<(Taiwanese folk song)>

37:57.333 --> 37:59.499
Ok, no plays. What about songs?

37:59.583 --> 38:00.957
At least we can sing.

38:01.041 --> 38:01.624
Right?

38:01.708 --> 38:02.332
Let's sing.

38:12.291 --> 38:12.999
Stop singing!

38:15.541 --> 38:16.374
Stop singing!

38:16.458 --> 38:18.415
- Stop singing!

38:44.375 --> 38:46.290
What's that they're singing?

38:47.833 --> 38:50.957
Some kind of Taiwanese spells.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.707
I almost shit my pants.

39:00.833 --> 39:02.374
Thank you, sir.

39:02.458 --> 39:05.915
Thank you.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.457
At least she's happy now.

39:08.583 --> 39:09.582
Thank you.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.249
Tea? Coffee?

39:16.333 --> 39:17.915
Coffee, please.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.540
There's something on your face.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.540
Is there?

39:20.916 --> 39:22.040
Master Pig just told me

39:22.125 --> 39:23.290
share today's takings

39:23.375 --> 39:24.707
with everyone.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.082
How we've got here.

39:32.791 --> 39:35.165
Yeah, we kicked the Japanese out
of the theatre.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.124
What's this painting doing here?

39:43.750 --> 39:46.249
I'm entering it in a competition

39:46.333 --> 39:49.290
just not sure about the colours yet.

39:58.625 --> 39:59.624
Hey, my painting!

39:59.708 --> 40:01.124
What's wrong with you!

40:11.916 --> 40:12.624
Look at you.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.832
You can half kill yourself and still be here.

40:14.916 --> 40:15.874
Understand?

40:15.958 --> 40:18.207
Let me tell you

40:18.291 --> 40:19.832
all you need to do is take a picture.

40:20.625 --> 40:21.749
Really?
- Right!

40:21.833 --> 40:23.582
Let's do it. Yeah.

40:27.916 --> 40:29.040
Enough of that!

40:29.125 --> 40:30.207
Are you trying to kill me?

40:30.291 --> 40:30.999
It's not working!

40:31.083 --> 40:31.957
Why's that?

40:32.041 --> 40:34.290
Stop strangling me.

40:38.333 --> 40:39.249
It's still not working.

40:39.333 --> 40:40.332
Why?

40:41.166 --> 40:42.124
I know.

40:42.208 --> 40:43.165
Don't bother now.

40:43.625 --> 40:46.082
Did you make a wish?

40:47.958 --> 40:50.082
Pointing the camera
at the painting isn't enough.

40:50.166 --> 40:53.040
You need to make a wish with all your heart.

40:53.125 --> 40:55.999
To get wherever you want to go.

40:56.083 --> 40:57.707
Or you'll just get lost.

41:07.583 --> 41:09.957
Damn it, why the President's office?

41:11.208 --> 41:13.290
My wish was to make big money.

41:13.375 --> 41:17.082
So I travelled back 100 years
to Twa-Tiu-Tiann.

41:18.125 --> 41:19.290
Where am I?

41:19.375 --> 41:21.124
You're in Twa-Tiu-Tiann.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.207
TTT?!

41:24.083 --> 41:26.832
Here, I met Ginger.

41:27.666 --> 41:30.624
They assume I go abroad when I disappear.

41:31.375 --> 41:34.499
In fact I'm travelling through time

41:34.583 --> 41:36.749
to be with Ginger.

41:37.250 --> 41:40.957
Making ancient money in a modern way.

41:41.041 --> 41:43.957
Everything I make I give to Ginger.

41:44.041 --> 41:48.124
Hoping that she'll say yes one day.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.499
Never seen a woman before?

41:53.291 --> 41:54.707
Never. You're the first.

41:57.916 --> 41:58.915
What do you think?

42:01.750 --> 42:03.374
This is brilliant!

42:03.458 --> 42:07.374
Anniversary sale at Ginger's!

42:07.458 --> 42:09.374
Buy one

42:09.458 --> 42:11.915
Get one free for your kid.

42:18.166 --> 42:21.290
I've never heard of an anniversary sale.

42:21.375 --> 42:22.499
Such great idea.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.374
That's all my idea.

42:26.791 --> 42:28.874
Good for you, good for me.

42:28.958 --> 42:30.165
That's right.

42:30.250 --> 42:31.915
Look around!

42:32.000 --> 42:33.290
Do you know how much the book is?

42:33.375 --> 42:34.374
$2,000.

42:34.916 --> 42:38.540
Special offer, $888.

42:39.791 --> 42:40.832
In those days

42:40.916 --> 42:44.582
the glorious Golden Age of Taiwan

42:44.666 --> 42:46.665
Thank you, P.

42:46.750 --> 42:50.165
Everybody's working hard and getting rich.

42:50.250 --> 42:52.499
This is TTT!

42:54.375 --> 42:56.665
Did you make a wish before coming?

42:57.083 --> 42:57.957
Make a wish...

42:58.041 --> 42:59.207
What wish?

42:59.291 --> 43:00.124
Let me see.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.499
I didn't. Did you?

43:02.583 --> 43:03.290
I did.

43:03.375 --> 43:03.999
What did you wish for?

43:04.083 --> 43:06.624
I wanted a piece of ginger cake.

43:06.875 --> 43:08.582
Ginger cake?

43:08.666 --> 43:09.957
GINGER!

43:10.541 --> 43:11.332
Whatever.

43:11.416 --> 43:12.332
I don't get it.

43:12.416 --> 43:14.374
I mean Ms Ginger, you idiot.

43:14.833 --> 43:16.290
You never get it.

43:19.041 --> 43:19.957
Come on.

43:21.625 --> 43:23.582
Let's make a deal.

43:26.416 --> 43:29.790
I'll have someone finish that painting asap.

43:29.875 --> 43:31.999
And then you'll be able to get home.

43:32.583 --> 43:35.207
But I need a favour in return.

43:35.291 --> 43:37.124
Keep an eye on Ginger for me.

43:37.666 --> 43:39.290
See if she's got anyone on the side.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.707
She's your type, eh?

43:42.791 --> 43:44.415
Not just my type...

43:44.500 --> 43:46.082
My ginger cake!

43:46.625 --> 43:49.332
So you'd like to... birds and bees...

43:49.416 --> 43:50.374
Right?

43:50.458 --> 43:51.457
You got it.

43:52.750 --> 43:53.707
No way!

43:58.041 --> 43:58.749
No?

43:58.833 --> 44:00.290
God bless you then.

44:00.375 --> 44:03.457
You'll never make it.

44:08.791 --> 44:09.874
Are you crazy?

44:30.375 --> 44:31.832
It's late already.

44:31.916 --> 44:32.665
What are you doing here?

44:32.750 --> 44:34.332
I was worried about you.

44:34.416 --> 44:36.749
The cop hit you.

44:36.833 --> 44:38.582
Are you alright?

44:38.666 --> 44:39.415
I'm fine.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.374
Take your top off and I'll take a look.

44:41.458 --> 44:42.582
Hands off.

44:43.291 --> 44:44.207
Just go home.

44:51.875 --> 44:53.415
I don't think you've had supper yet.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.707
So I got you these rice dumplings.

44:55.791 --> 44:56.540
I'm fine.

44:56.625 --> 44:58.624
But you've got to eat something.

44:58.708 --> 44:59.790
Not hungry.

45:01.208 --> 45:02.374
Where's today's takings?

45:02.458 --> 45:04.499
Here you are.

45:06.416 --> 45:07.624
Here.

45:09.416 --> 45:10.957
This will be my dinner.

45:12.333 --> 45:14.249
So can I stay the night?

45:16.041 --> 45:17.499
Don't be so cruel.

45:17.583 --> 45:20.874
I got Jack here to work for you

45:20.958 --> 45:22.707
and you don't need to pay him a bean.

45:22.791 --> 45:23.624
Right?

45:23.708 --> 45:24.874
How come HE can stay here

45:24.958 --> 45:25.790
Not ME?

45:26.791 --> 45:28.040
You really want to come in?

45:28.125 --> 45:29.749
Really!

45:30.875 --> 45:31.999
Fine.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.707
Learn this.

45:38.458 --> 45:39.165
OK.

45:41.541 --> 45:43.374
She sells seashells.

45:43.458 --> 45:45.290
Seashells she sells.

45:45.375 --> 45:46.874
She sells seashells.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.332
Seashells she sells.

45:48.416 --> 45:50.415
This is how you say sea.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.999
This is how you say she.

45:53.083 --> 45:53.790
Now, your turn.

45:53.875 --> 45:54.832
Damn it.

45:56.500 --> 45:57.790
Sea and C makes...

45:57.875 --> 45:59.207
C and sea.

46:02.750 --> 46:04.290
Please let me in.

46:07.708 --> 46:08.915
My hand!

46:09.000 --> 46:10.332
You asked for it.

46:10.416 --> 46:11.457
It hurts.
- Let me see.

46:11.791 --> 46:13.082
It's fine.

46:13.166 --> 46:16.249
Now you'll have to let me in

46:16.333 --> 46:17.624
to take care of my injury.

46:21.541 --> 46:22.415
You're driving me crazy,

46:23.083 --> 46:24.790
Both of you!

46:24.875 --> 46:26.040
One plays dumb,

46:26.125 --> 46:27.874
the other keeps snickering.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.707
Let me give you a hand.

46:34.083 --> 46:34.999
Go away.

46:38.708 --> 46:39.457
Bye.

46:43.125 --> 46:44.665
Afraid people will see you flirting?

46:44.750 --> 46:45.540
Go away!

46:46.375 --> 46:47.707
Fine.

46:53.208 --> 46:54.457
Where am I going to sleep?

47:16.416 --> 47:21.790
<Lonely night beside the candle...>

47:23.666 --> 47:25.415
And... now I'm stuck.

47:27.416 --> 47:28.540
Stuck?

47:29.458 --> 47:30.540
Isn't it... (Starts singing)

47:33.750 --> 47:34.707
It's Billboard No.1!

47:40.625 --> 47:41.665
Wow that's brilliant!

47:42.875 --> 47:43.749
Do you write songs?

47:43.833 --> 47:44.957
No, no, I can't.

47:52.083 --> 47:53.707
The Geisha girls!

47:53.791 --> 47:54.874
Geisha girls!

47:55.541 --> 47:56.582
Wait for me.

47:57.833 --> 47:58.749
Finish your painting!

48:02.791 --> 48:03.707
Rose...

48:49.333 --> 48:50.082
This is for you.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.457
Rose,

48:51.541 --> 48:52.582
Let him hang there.

48:52.666 --> 48:53.790
See how long he can do it.

49:02.750 --> 49:04.915
Hi, I'm Jack.

49:09.875 --> 49:12.082
You're Ms Ginger's son?

49:14.708 --> 49:15.374
No.

49:17.708 --> 49:18.999
He is the TREE.

49:22.666 --> 49:23.457
That's right.

49:23.833 --> 49:24.874
I'm the TREE

49:24.958 --> 49:30.249
the one with the flowers.

49:30.333 --> 49:32.165
Anyone actually buying anything?

49:34.000 --> 49:36.290
Sure, still looking.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.290
It's no use.

49:49.083 --> 49:51.915
Where'd you learn to play guitar?

49:53.750 --> 49:55.207
I learned from a book.

49:55.500 --> 49:56.540
I can teach you.

49:59.250 --> 50:00.374
OK.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.415
Do you have asthma?

50:05.750 --> 50:06.582
What?

50:12.916 --> 50:14.082
I'm Rose.

50:15.125 --> 50:16.249
The blooming rose.

50:17.833 --> 50:19.165
The blooming rose.

50:20.083 --> 50:21.165
Rose.

50:24.375 --> 50:25.749
That's a pretty name.

50:30.583 --> 50:31.832
The speech is starting.

50:31.916 --> 50:32.957
Come quick.

50:33.625 --> 50:34.749
Hurry.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.707
Rose, let's go.

50:40.750 --> 50:42.874
Today's Taiwanese are ill.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.832
From what I can see, we're suffering

50:46.916 --> 50:48.790
from severe cultural malnutrition.

50:50.666 --> 50:51.832
The Japanese tell us

50:52.583 --> 50:54.207
that opium is safe.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.749
Why encourage Taiwanese to smoke it,

50:57.833 --> 50:59.457
but forbid their own people?

51:00.666 --> 51:01.582
Who's he?

51:01.958 --> 51:04.332
Dr. Chiang from Yi-Ian.

51:04.666 --> 51:05.665
By doing so,

51:05.750 --> 51:07.499
They're practically slaughtering
the Taiwanese.

51:07.583 --> 51:08.499
Chiang.

51:08.583 --> 51:10.499
Treating us as second-class citizens.

51:13.125 --> 51:13.832
You don't know him?

51:13.916 --> 51:15.374
Take this.

51:16.166 --> 51:17.582
I do know him.

51:17.916 --> 51:21.540
This is the worst kind of tyranny.

51:30.916 --> 51:33.332
This is our land, where our ancestors...

51:33.416 --> 51:34.457
Shut up!

51:42.291 --> 51:43.832
What's this about?

51:45.500 --> 51:46.957
Got a problem?

51:49.166 --> 51:50.290
You shouldn't do this.

51:50.375 --> 51:51.415
People are talking...

51:53.791 --> 51:54.874
It's not right.

51:54.958 --> 51:56.707
How could you do this?

51:58.833 --> 52:00.374
Yeah, how could you.

52:02.875 --> 52:03.999
Now what?

52:12.208 --> 52:13.290
Let's go.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.040
Chiang.

52:24.083 --> 52:25.624
Have you got a permit?

52:26.250 --> 52:28.457
We need a permit?

52:37.666 --> 52:38.999
I assume so.

52:40.041 --> 52:41.082
Really?

52:42.250 --> 52:43.082
I'm sorry.

52:43.166 --> 52:43.999
They do, right?

52:44.083 --> 52:45.874
Absolutely.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.290
Yes, right?
- Yes.

52:48.083 --> 52:49.790
What's happening now?
- Get inside.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.874
Don't ask, just hide.

52:51.958 --> 52:53.624
Why hide? There's no one here.

52:53.708 --> 52:55.207
Hide, quick.

53:03.833 --> 53:05.457
How many times have I told you?

53:06.416 --> 53:09.915
Not to get involved with politics.

53:12.500 --> 53:13.582
I know.

53:14.041 --> 53:16.415
It'll spoil it for you with the Japanese.

53:17.458 --> 53:18.999
What are you talking about?

53:19.458 --> 53:21.749
If it weren't for the Japanese.

53:21.833 --> 53:24.124
How would we ever have done so well,

53:24.208 --> 53:25.665
selling our teas all over the world?

53:25.750 --> 53:28.832
And become the top tea trader in TTT?

53:29.125 --> 53:31.207
Now there's the Japanese investment

53:31.291 --> 53:33.040
in our fabric business.

53:34.916 --> 53:38.499
It's the Japanese
who show us how big the world is.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.124
They also make us realize

53:43.208 --> 53:44.540
how small we are.

54:01.500 --> 54:02.999
Anyone thirsty?

54:03.083 --> 54:04.749
Cup of tea?

54:07.958 --> 54:10.415
There's going to be a party next month.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.415
The governor's going to
invite all the local VIPs.

54:13.958 --> 54:16.915
The Geisha need to perform at the party.

54:17.291 --> 54:19.290
The theatre will organize the rehearsals.

54:19.375 --> 54:20.915
You need to practice!

54:25.833 --> 54:28.832
Come see our brand new product.

54:29.166 --> 54:30.249
Oolong-scented garments.

54:30.750 --> 54:32.707
With the fragrance of Oolong tea

54:32.791 --> 54:34.415
and Jasmine-scented dresses.

54:34.500 --> 54:35.415
Oolong...

54:36.916 --> 54:38.165
No customers over the road,

54:38.250 --> 54:39.207
They're finished.

54:39.291 --> 54:40.082
Hey,

54:40.541 --> 54:41.999
Where can I find dried roots?

54:42.500 --> 54:43.374
Dried roots?

54:43.458 --> 54:44.624
Try the market.

54:44.708 --> 54:45.249
No, I mean

54:45.333 --> 54:49.749
that herbal stuff, like Ginseng.

54:50.541 --> 54:51.749
Oh, Ginseng.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.457
Ginseng garments.

54:56.541 --> 54:57.749
Will make gentlemen

54:58.041 --> 54:59.915
healthy and strong.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.332
Healthy and strong!

55:01.750 --> 55:02.999
Ladies who wear them

55:03.083 --> 55:05.124
will be feisty and fit.

55:05.208 --> 55:06.707
Feisty and fit!

55:06.791 --> 55:07.790
Let's do it.

55:07.875 --> 55:08.332
Let's do it!

55:08.416 --> 55:09.499
What are you waiting for!

55:10.583 --> 55:11.790
That looks cool.

55:11.875 --> 55:12.415
Really cool!

55:12.500 --> 55:13.707
That's a little weird.

55:13.791 --> 55:14.290
Weird?

55:14.375 --> 55:15.790
We do it at "rock n roll" concerts!

55:17.125 --> 55:18.040
"Rock n roll"?

55:18.375 --> 55:20.499
Because it's impossible, we have to do it.

55:20.583 --> 55:21.540
Cool.

55:21.625 --> 55:22.290
Just do it!

55:25.208 --> 55:26.540
A wave!

55:28.541 --> 55:30.999
Thanks for coming to the catwalk...

55:31.083 --> 55:33.082
to see these fabulous dresses

55:33.166 --> 55:36.540
Every dress is made by Ms Ginger.

55:37.458 --> 55:38.874
Excuse me.

55:38.958 --> 55:39.915
Sorry.

55:42.125 --> 55:43.874
What are you doing?

55:43.958 --> 55:45.665
What if she doesn't like me?

55:46.250 --> 55:46.999
Black.

55:47.750 --> 55:48.665
Give her this.

55:52.541 --> 55:53.457
Jane.

55:53.958 --> 55:55.332
I made it myself.

55:55.791 --> 55:56.749
It's for you.

55:59.708 --> 56:01.207
It smells of Jasmine.

56:02.375 --> 56:04.790
Now, Ms. Ginger.

56:13.958 --> 56:16.249
Do this.

56:17.375 --> 56:18.915
It's all the rage overseas.

56:19.458 --> 56:21.082
Yes, that's it.

56:21.666 --> 56:22.415
Yeah, that's it.

56:22.500 --> 56:23.332
Selfie!

56:23.625 --> 56:24.207
OK.

56:24.583 --> 56:26.624
3, 2, 1.

56:26.708 --> 56:27.499
Yeah.

56:51.625 --> 56:54.124
I want to be somebody, too.

56:57.166 --> 56:58.165
Make a wish?

57:18.000 --> 57:19.165
If I told you

57:20.250 --> 57:22.832
I came from 100 years in the future.

57:24.125 --> 57:25.290
Would you believe me?

57:27.083 --> 57:28.332
If that's true,

57:28.916 --> 57:30.332
how did you get here?

57:34.208 --> 57:35.457
At that time.

57:35.958 --> 57:37.957
I was with my friends at an exhibition.

57:38.416 --> 57:40.957
I saw this big painting.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.582
It's like I was suddenly
sucked into the painting.

57:44.708 --> 57:46.582
I was falling, flying.

57:46.666 --> 57:49.332
Falling from 100 years in the future.

57:49.416 --> 57:51.290
Down to 80, 50 years

57:51.375 --> 57:52.749
All the way down, down, down.

57:53.125 --> 57:54.415
By the time I got here,

57:54.500 --> 57:56.874
I remember it was around when

57:57.333 --> 57:58.999
the Japanese surrendered.

58:03.125 --> 58:03.999
What's so funny?

58:05.125 --> 58:06.790
Surrender? The Japanese?

58:07.541 --> 58:09.207
Impossible.

58:09.791 --> 58:11.582
Are you out of your mind?

58:11.833 --> 58:13.915
No, I'm serious.

58:15.666 --> 58:16.957
Although,

58:18.541 --> 58:20.207
I think I know what you mean.

58:23.250 --> 58:26.624
There are all sorts at the Geisha Club.

58:27.791 --> 58:28.874
Today,

58:30.083 --> 58:33.207
a British tea merchant comes in,

58:34.166 --> 58:35.332
Tomorrow,

58:35.958 --> 58:37.582
a German doctor.

58:38.791 --> 58:41.540
The world is moving so fast.

58:42.416 --> 58:43.832
Just like

58:43.916 --> 58:46.457
nothing seems impossible.

58:48.500 --> 58:49.957
Yesterday, I heard about

58:50.833 --> 58:52.957
a 19-year-old Taiwanese boy

58:53.041 --> 58:57.374
flying an airplane,
dropping leaflets over Tokyo

58:57.833 --> 58:59.374
protesting against
the Japanese government.

59:00.500 --> 59:01.874
Flying an airplane!

59:03.041 --> 59:03.999
I was thinking,

59:04.500 --> 59:06.415
we'll probably all have

59:07.291 --> 59:09.040
our own airplanes in the future.

59:10.583 --> 59:11.499
Am I right?

59:13.041 --> 59:14.290
Not exactly,

59:14.375 --> 59:15.790
airplanes are kind of expensive.

59:23.916 --> 59:24.582
Rose,

59:25.458 --> 59:28.707
will you always be a Geisha girl?

59:35.458 --> 59:36.874
I want to be a singer,

59:38.416 --> 59:39.707
and an actress, too.

59:40.166 --> 59:42.832
I want to make a difference.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.457
That won't be easy.

59:51.500 --> 59:56.207
Not everything is easy.

59:58.291 --> 59:59.874
When I was 6-years-old,

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:02.082
I was sold to the Geisha Club.

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:03.749
At that time,

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:06.082
I was worth 100 dollars.

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:08.624
Nowadays,

01:00:09.291 --> 01:00:12.707
guests pay hundreds of dollars

01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.624
just to hear me sing.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.207
People say,

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:22.457
"You go where the money is."

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.124
If I don't give up,

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:30.665
I'm sure I'll make it one day.

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.582
You will.

01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:44.832
What are you going to sing
at the Governor's party?

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.499
Haven't decided yet.

01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:49.790
Let me teach you a new song then.

01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:57.040
(Japanese) Is that Mr. Goto?

01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.124
Could you introduce me to him?

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.499
Sure.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:01.624
Mr. Goto.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.249
This is Dr. Chiang and Mr. Lin.

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:10.165
They've organized
a special welcome for the prince.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:16.749
We've been working on something.

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:21.540
His majesty won't be disappointed.

01:01:22.291 --> 01:01:26.290
To avoid unnecessary disruption.

01:01:27.541 --> 01:01:28.540
For example,

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.790
we've decided to suspend

01:01:34.041 --> 01:01:36.665
all daily routines

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:41.499
everything should stop.

01:01:44.083 --> 01:01:47.249
Is that necessary?

01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:48.540
I'm afraid

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:51.374
his majesty won't see the real Taiwan.

01:01:55.666 --> 01:01:59.082
Dr. Chiang means...

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:04.249
The whole point of his majesty's visit

01:02:04.333 --> 01:02:06.249
is to see the real Taiwan.

01:02:06.916 --> 01:02:10.624
Not to see a Tokyo wannabe.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.415
All the extravagance.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.749
All that song and dance.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:28.165
Is that going to fool anyone?

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:38.290
I've always admired how

01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:44.749
patriotic and straightforward you are.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:54.874
You seem to have something to say?

01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:04.332
Not just me.

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:06.582
Lots more Taiwanese do.

01:03:07.208 --> 01:03:08.832
Particularly about the opium trade.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:18.290
Could I have the permission

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.082
to sing a new song for you, sir?

01:03:20.791 --> 01:03:21.999
That'd be great.

01:03:22.541 --> 01:03:24.582
Go ahead.

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.165
Certainly.

01:03:26.416 --> 01:03:27.749
Show time.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.165
This way, please.

01:03:58.416 --> 01:04:02.957
<The train is leaving.>

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:09.082
<Goodbye, my hometown.>

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:15.915
<Goodbye, my family.>

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:22.624
<Goodbye, my friends.>

01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:29.332
<I'm going to Twa-Tiu-Tiann>

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.082
<where my dreams will come true.>

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:42.749
<Friends say I'm naïve.>

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:49.874
<But I'll stand on my two feet.>

01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:56.040
<Oh, good bye.>

01:04:58.791 --> 01:05:03.082
<Oh, nothing will stop me.>

01:05:05.541 --> 01:05:09.665
<Oh, goodbye.>

01:05:11.666 --> 01:05:16.415
<Oh, let's move on.>

01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:17.540
Bravo!

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:18.790
Bravo!

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:49.749
<Oh, goodbye.>

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:56.540
<Oh, nothing will stop me.>

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.165
It's great to dance.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.165
Yeah.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.999
Enjoying yourself?

01:06:35.083 --> 01:06:36.207
It's fun.

01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:37.415
Fun?
- Yeah.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.165
Yeah.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.582
Now what are you doing?

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.415
We need to get closer.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.665
Give him an inch

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:49.499
and he takes a yard.

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:50.874
No way!

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:56.165
You're incorrigible.

01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:00.874
Senbai.

01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:01.540
Let's go.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:04.457
Come on, give me a break.

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:06.040
There's no such thing as ghosts.

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.415
We'll just keep going

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:26.957
all night long?

01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:30.707
It's like kneading dough.

01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:32.957
Nonsense.

01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:34.165
It is.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.165
What do you mean "kneading dough"?

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.124
What was that?

01:07:38.208 --> 01:07:40.374
OK, let's take a look.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:41.874
Senbai, you first.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.082
Excuse me.

01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:04.082
That's alright.

01:08:18.041 --> 01:08:18.999
The future...

01:08:20.207 --> 01:08:22.290
What does the future look like?

01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:24.165
The future...

01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:28.957
It's a very different world.

01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:32.374
You can buy anything anytime you want.

01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:37.665
Questions? You get your answers instantly.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.499
Everything's become so easy.

01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:44.124
So easy that

01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:48.415
you forget about dreams

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.374
forget about youth.

01:08:56.082 --> 01:08:57.707
Youth...

01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:28.457
The flower of youth is...

01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:01.582
Please, help me find my "true love".

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.124
Take me to Joy Luck Club.

01:12:51.583 --> 01:12:52.124
Jack!

01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:14.582
What are you doing?

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:18.624
I'm not doing anything, she is...

01:13:19.125 --> 01:13:21.040
Where did she get the money for this?

01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:22.249
Ms Ginger!

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:24.624
I gave her the money.

01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:26.832
You?

01:13:28.083 --> 01:13:29.540
You ripped everyone off

01:13:29.625 --> 01:13:30.249
just to buy her opium?

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:31.040
Are you crazy?

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:31.790
I'm not.

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:32.957
Don't be so angry.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.207
Ms Ginger.

01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:34.999
We've got to go.

01:13:35.083 --> 01:13:37.040
We've got to get out of here.

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:38.165
Baby...

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:40.040
Baby? What baby?

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:40.832
Ms Ginger.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:43.749
Baby, her son.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:45.165
Baby.

01:13:47.541 --> 01:13:49.874
Ms Ginger, I'm not your baby.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.040
Let's go.

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:51.999
Why don't you help?

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:53.499
OK.

01:13:53.583 --> 01:13:55.082
Let's get out of here.

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:56.082
Pig.

01:13:56.458 --> 01:13:57.749
My baby.

01:13:58.666 --> 01:13:59.499
Master Pig.

01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:00.707
Yes.

01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:02.499
What are you doing here?

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:03.415
Nothing.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.332
Stop messing about. Get out.

01:14:05.916 --> 01:14:07.540
Ms Ginger, let's go home.

01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:09.832
I'm not Baby, I'm Jack.

01:14:10.541 --> 01:14:12.082
Found a toy boy, eh?

01:14:12.291 --> 01:14:15.499
Toy boy, my ass.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:18.374
Hang on. You haven't paid.

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:24.040
Not enough.

01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:25.290
The price's gone up again?

01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:28.457
This is a rip-off.

01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:29.707
How much do you think I'm making?

01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:31.707
The Japanese are in charge.

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:34.874
Go get yourself some medication.

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.457
Take care.

01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:47.457
Let Ginger rest.

01:14:48.416 --> 01:14:50.165
How many more addicts are there?

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.499
Just one more.

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.957
They say you die if you quit opium.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:00.082
Is Jane going to die?

01:15:01.791 --> 01:15:03.374
Jane's on opium?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.082
What are we going to do?

01:15:08.166 --> 01:15:10.207
Please, doctor.

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:12.040
Don't ask her to quit now.

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.249
Don't ask her to quit now.

01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:16.332
She seems fine now.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:17.832
Please?

01:15:17.916 --> 01:15:18.749
Doctor?

01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:20.957
Doctor, please.

01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:22.874
Please.

01:15:22.958 --> 01:15:23.915
She can't die.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:24.915
Please.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.457
She won't die.

01:15:28.125 --> 01:15:29.665
Opium addiction can be treated.

01:15:33.666 --> 01:15:35.249
But if even people like you don't know...

01:15:37.041 --> 01:15:38.915
what about the public.

01:15:51.833 --> 01:15:53.582
I can try to save them, one at a time.

01:15:56.541 --> 01:15:58.374
But time is running out.

01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:04.290
I can save maybe this area.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.332
But I can't save the whole island.

01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:15.999
The Taiwanese must wake up.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:18.915
Otherwise,

01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:23.124
The Japanese will never respect us.

01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:33.707
When will the Taiwanese ever wake up?

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.624
Doctor.

01:16:43.416 --> 01:16:44.749
Let's go.

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.457
OK. Let's go.

01:16:47.875 --> 01:16:49.040
Where to?

01:16:50.583 --> 01:16:52.207
To the opium house?

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:53.999
How do you know?

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:00.915
Professor P.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.415
Why did you bring me

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:04.290
back here?

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:07.207
Why? To show you the history.

01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:09.165
To help you find your future.

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:11.540
My future. What about hers?

01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.790
She's going to die if this doesn't stop.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:19.290
Why can't you save her?

01:17:21.125 --> 01:17:22.249
You know.

01:17:23.375 --> 01:17:25.082
I'm crazy about her.

01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:28.999
I've travelled 100 years back just for her.

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:30.832
Baby...

01:17:33.041 --> 01:17:34.374
I want to see Baby...

01:17:35.541 --> 01:17:36.040
I want to see Baby...

01:17:36.125 --> 01:17:37.499
You can't go back again.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.040
I'll do anything.

01:17:39.125 --> 01:17:40.374
Just let me see my baby.

01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:41.290
OK I'll take you.

01:17:41.375 --> 01:17:42.582
Alright, let's go.

01:17:42.666 --> 01:17:43.832
Let go of me.

01:17:43.916 --> 01:17:45.082
I want to see Baby!

01:17:46.125 --> 01:17:47.582
No more opium!

01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:49.999
No more drugs.

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:51.624
Mum!

01:17:57.208 --> 01:17:59.040
She's bitten me all over...

01:18:17.791 --> 01:18:18.915
Baby...

01:18:26.208 --> 01:18:27.165
Baby...

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:41.457
I'm a Qing.

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:45.707
After the Qing was overthrown.

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:47.999
My entire family

01:18:49.416 --> 01:18:51.707
was wiped out.

01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:55.915
10 years ago

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.957
I came to Taiwan.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.415
I got married.

01:19:04.083 --> 01:19:05.624
Had my baby.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.915
But then,

01:19:11.125 --> 01:19:13.582
my husband got cholera and died.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.374
My baby got it, too.

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:19.749
The doctor said,

01:19:20.875 --> 01:19:23.124
there was nothing he could do.

01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:27.165
So I gave Baby...

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:30.082
opium...

01:19:33.583 --> 01:19:34.290
Baby?

01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:39.165
You're sweating.

01:19:42.375 --> 01:19:44.457
He wouldn't be so scared

01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:49.582
if he could die in my arms.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.624
Whenever I smoke opium,

01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:24.332
I see my baby.

01:20:48.833 --> 01:20:52.290
That's why Professor P needs money.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.540
Everyone says I'm a cursed woman.

01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:02.665
I can't go back to China

01:21:05.375 --> 01:21:07.165
and I have no home here.

01:21:13.166 --> 01:21:15.165
Luckily, he turned up.

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:20.165
In fact,

01:21:22.583 --> 01:21:24.790
I've long been relying on him.

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:30.165
But why does he come and go

01:21:33.041 --> 01:21:35.499
doesn't seem to belong to this world.

01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:39.957
I can't fall for him.

01:21:45.791 --> 01:21:47.415
I can't fall for him.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:04.624
Do I really look like your mother?

01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:07.540
Back then...

01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:10.915
I couldn't save her...

01:22:13.041 --> 01:22:14.374
But now,

01:22:15.916 --> 01:22:17.249
I can save you.

01:22:33.541 --> 01:22:35.749
Time that I let Baby go.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:40.457
Right?

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:24.332
What's going on?

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:28.207
Could this be what he wished for?

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.415
Opium addiction can be treated.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.582
Say no to opium!

01:23:48.666 --> 01:23:51.790
It'll kill you.

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:55.832
Opium makes you look horrible.

01:23:55.916 --> 01:23:59.999
Soon as you quit, you're good as new.

01:24:00.083 --> 01:24:02.957
Look, she looked horrible
when she was on opium.

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.165
Hideous, look.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.874
Really disgusting.

01:24:07.958 --> 01:24:10.332
Who'd like her.

01:24:10.416 --> 01:24:12.165
Scary.

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:20.624
But look at her now, stunning.

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:25.290
Say no to opium.

01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:29.249
Look, he's so fit because
he doesn't smoke opium.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.374
Say no to opium.

01:24:31.458 --> 01:24:33.415
For your health, for your family.

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.374
Please say no to opium.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:39.665
"Opium makes you impotent!"

01:24:40.541 --> 01:24:41.624
Says who?

01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:43.707
These leaflets are everywhere.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.582
I've had enough of these people

01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:56.290
trying to ruin my business?

01:24:58.708 --> 01:25:01.082
What to do now?

01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:03.832
I'm hungry. Talk about it later.

01:25:03.916 --> 01:25:06.624
Boss!

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:12.165
The river is cold in the fog,
enshrouded in moonlight.

01:25:13.083 --> 01:25:16.957
The river after dark where cabarets nearby.

01:25:17.666 --> 01:25:21.124
Courtesans perceive not the sorrow
of a perished empire.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.082
Across the river singing
continues into the night.

01:25:27.208 --> 01:25:29.415
Inspector, cheers.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.999
What's wrong with me?

01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:33.165
What have I done now?

01:25:33.958 --> 01:25:35.082
What are you doing?

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:36.624
The Inspector is here.

01:25:36.708 --> 01:25:37.582
Let go.

01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:41.582
Get back.

01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:43.874
Keep on playing.

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.374
What's this?

01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:51.082
What's this?

01:25:54.333 --> 01:25:55.790
Chiang's Hospital.

01:25:56.166 --> 01:26:00.082
Chiang's getting on our nerves.

01:26:00.166 --> 01:26:02.165
He has to be warned.

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:05.165
What the hell's he talking about?

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:10.124
He's telling you to set fire to Chiang's office.

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.499
I can't do that.

01:26:14.291 --> 01:26:15.499
I'm Taiwanese.

01:26:16.166 --> 01:26:17.415
I don't take threats.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.707
I'm not afraid of death.

01:26:18.791 --> 01:26:21.040
Setting fire to fellow Taiwanese's house?

01:26:21.125 --> 01:26:22.457
I can't do that!

01:26:25.541 --> 01:26:31.624
You can't threaten me.

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:33.665
What's that?

01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:35.207
What's that?

01:26:35.875 --> 01:26:36.707
What?

01:26:40.208 --> 01:26:44.082
OK, that's different.

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:46.665
Only one way to test it.

01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:49.790
Real gold.

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:53.124
Take it.

01:26:54.583 --> 01:26:55.582
What was he saying?

01:26:55.666 --> 01:26:56.749
Take it with you.

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.749
Take it with me? I got it.

01:26:59.041 --> 01:27:00.665
Greedy.

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:04.915
Excuse me.

01:27:11.458 --> 01:27:13.457
What are you staring at?

01:27:21.375 --> 01:27:22.749
Manners.

01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:24.499
Never stop, no matter what.

01:27:29.625 --> 01:27:31.249
I'm going to be a millionaire.

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:33.415
Where to hide it?

01:27:33.958 --> 01:27:35.582
Somewhere secret...

01:27:35.666 --> 01:27:36.749
Here.

01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:46.540
Is that why you're here?

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.165
Money?

01:27:49.708 --> 01:27:51.957
Are you out of your mind?

01:27:52.666 --> 01:27:53.749
When you're rich

01:27:54.125 --> 01:27:56.082
everyone loves you.

01:27:56.541 --> 01:27:57.124
When you're poor

01:27:57.208 --> 01:27:59.374
everyone treats you like shit.

01:28:00.125 --> 01:28:02.374
I'm done with being poor.

01:28:02.458 --> 01:28:04.165
Money talks

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:06.040
When you're rich

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.832
you can get away with murder.

01:28:10.583 --> 01:28:12.332
What's wrong with money?

01:28:14.750 --> 01:28:16.999
I can share it with you.

01:28:19.583 --> 01:28:21.707
Give us the gold.

01:28:22.458 --> 01:28:23.665
You can't do that.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.749
Let go.

01:28:25.833 --> 01:28:29.415
The gold bar has sworn to be mine forever.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:32.457
It was never yours!

01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:34.249
What?

01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:36.707
Burn down the opium house?

01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:39.957
Where would Ginger go then?

01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:41.832
Opium?

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.457
You can't go back there.

01:28:44.791 --> 01:28:47.665
Opium will kill you.

01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:49.665
It'll turn you into a hag.

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:52.249
If you really care about Ms Ginger

01:28:52.791 --> 01:28:55.665
I love her, I'm crazy about her.

01:28:57.333 --> 01:28:59.957
Is it my hands or the light that's shaking?

01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:01.082
Why's this happening?

01:29:01.166 --> 01:29:03.540
Am I really doing this?

01:29:41.666 --> 01:29:44.790
Give this all to Dr. Chiang.

01:29:44.875 --> 01:29:46.832
Just tell him

01:29:46.916 --> 01:29:48.707
it's from an anonymous donor.

01:29:49.208 --> 01:29:51.124
Don't let him know who it's from.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:54.374
Only if he insists,
you can tell him where it's from.

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.249
(Japanese)
The opium house is burned down

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.749
and we found this.

01:30:08.833 --> 01:30:12.332
A coin with Chiang's portrait on it?

01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:15.457
Apparently he's going to

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:19.207
overthrow the Japanese reign
and declare independence

01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:22.499
Now we've got him.

01:30:22.916 --> 01:30:23.540
Am I right?

01:30:23.625 --> 01:30:24.457
Yes!

01:30:24.541 --> 01:30:25.040
Am I right?

01:30:25.125 --> 01:30:26.040
Yes!

01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:36.957
Yes!
- Am I right?

01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:54.249
How dare you set fire to the opium house?

01:30:54.333 --> 01:30:56.207
Don't be mad.

01:30:56.291 --> 01:30:57.499
What about I try again?

01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:58.290
Set fire to something again?

01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:00.249
Half price this time.

01:31:00.333 --> 01:31:02.165
Shut it, Pig.

01:31:04.208 --> 01:31:06.082
Inspector.

01:31:06.916 --> 01:31:07.790
Inspector.

01:31:09.708 --> 01:31:10.790
Mr. Kuroaki.

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:14.499
I strongly suggest that you leave now.

01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:19.374
You won't like it if things got out

01:31:19.708 --> 01:31:22.582
and ruin your reputation.

01:31:22.666 --> 01:31:23.665
Shut up!

01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:30.249
You think I don't know
about you secretly sponsoring Chiang?

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:35.290
Money doesn't make you Japanese.

01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:39.415
You're all second-class islanders.

01:31:41.375 --> 01:31:42.499
Take that back!

01:31:42.833 --> 01:31:44.207
I'm a first-class Taiwanese.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:57.874
Am I shot?

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.207
I'm shot.

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:02.790
No.

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:04.707
Inspector,

01:32:04.791 --> 01:32:05.749
why?!

01:32:07.166 --> 01:32:09.457
Ms Ginger is shot.

01:32:09.541 --> 01:32:10.457
Ms Ginger!

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.749
Ms Ginger!

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:19.124
Go arrest Chiang.

01:32:19.208 --> 01:32:20.124
Yes, sir.

01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:21.124
And

01:32:21.375 --> 01:32:25.249
tell all hospitals,
no treatment for gunshot wounds.

01:32:25.333 --> 01:32:26.332
Yes, sir.

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:27.790
Let's get out of here.

01:32:29.625 --> 01:32:31.374
Help!

01:32:32.166 --> 01:32:33.540
We must take her to the hospital.

01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:36.082
Why did they open fire?

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:37.707
You.

01:32:37.791 --> 01:32:40.540
Nothing to do with me.

01:32:41.666 --> 01:32:43.874
Get a doctor!

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:47.457
Hospitals won't take her.

01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:50.874
Let's take her back to the future.

01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:52.207
That's right.

01:32:55.916 --> 01:32:56.874
Careful.

01:33:00.875 --> 01:33:01.957
Careful.

01:33:05.333 --> 01:33:06.915
Dad.

01:33:11.250 --> 01:33:12.290
Dad!

01:33:12.375 --> 01:33:13.540
Ginger,

01:33:13.625 --> 01:33:16.165
hang in there.

01:33:16.666 --> 01:33:19.457
I love you so much,
I've learned everything you taught me.

01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:21.165
She sells seashells.

01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:23.207
Seashells she sells.

01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:25.374
She sells seashells.

01:33:25.458 --> 01:33:27.415
Seashells she sells.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.874
Please don't die.

01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:30.165
I've made a wish.

01:33:30.875 --> 01:33:32.624
I want to marry a super model.

01:33:32.708 --> 01:33:35.915
You haven't said yes, you can't die.

01:33:36.833 --> 01:33:38.165
You've learned it.

01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:39.374
She sells seashells.

01:33:39.458 --> 01:33:40.249
Say that again.

01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:41.999
Seashells she sells.

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.874
She sells seashells.

01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:46.790
Seashells she sells.

01:33:46.875 --> 01:33:49.040
Please don't die.

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.749
Are you pushing or not?

01:33:51.833 --> 01:33:53.499
Stop Seashelling!

01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:57.124
Your grandpa,

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:01.374
used to say

01:34:04.166 --> 01:34:05.624
Spring tea

01:34:09.791 --> 01:34:11.665
goes for aroma.

01:34:15.208 --> 01:34:16.665
Winter tea

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.040
goes for flavour.

01:34:33.916 --> 01:34:37.582
To grow good tea,

01:34:39.833 --> 01:34:46.749
you need hard working tea farmers.

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:53.415
Make sure they're looked after.

01:34:55.416 --> 01:34:56.332
Dad.

01:34:57.541 --> 01:34:58.415
Dad,

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:01.124
Don't talk now.

01:35:01.500 --> 01:35:02.832
The doctor will be here soon.

01:35:06.791 --> 01:35:08.832
Where are you from?

01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:13.165
I'm from TTT.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.999
The Lin family of TTT.

01:35:17.458 --> 01:35:18.624
Lin Wen-Xiou

01:35:19.875 --> 01:35:21.749
I'm from TTT.

01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:24.457
Dad.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.540
Dad.

01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:34.290
Dad.

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:42.999
Dad!

01:35:45.125 --> 01:35:46.457
Dad!

01:35:49.208 --> 01:35:51.165
I'm from TTT.

01:35:51.666 --> 01:35:52.790
I'm from TTT.

01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:53.707
Dad.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.415
I'm from TTT. Do you hear me?

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:57.374
Dad.

01:35:59.708 --> 01:36:00.540
Dad.

01:36:01.708 --> 01:36:02.832
Doctor,

01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:05.165
save my father.

01:36:11.583 --> 01:36:12.457
Dad.

01:36:13.791 --> 01:36:14.707
Dad.

01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:21.082
Save my father.

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:36.082
Professor P, you take care of Ms Ginger.

01:36:37.541 --> 01:36:38.665
Aren't you coming with us?

01:36:40.541 --> 01:36:43.207
We can't both disappear.

01:36:43.625 --> 01:36:46.082
I'm responsible for all this mess,

01:36:46.166 --> 01:36:47.040
I have to deal with it.

01:36:47.125 --> 01:36:49.874
That's right, go sort it out.

01:36:49.958 --> 01:36:51.582
Just be careful.

01:36:51.666 --> 01:36:53.915
Quick.

01:36:54.333 --> 01:36:57.415
Ginger, make a wish.
- 3, 2, 1.

01:37:26.291 --> 01:37:29.832
"Chiang has been arrested for treason."

01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:36.165
"The police will start searching
for accomplices."

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.374
"Royal Proclamation:
due to the impending royal visit."

01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:54.999
"Use of language is restricted
to Japanese only."

01:37:55.791 --> 01:38:02.082
"To avoid unnecessary disruption."

01:38:02.666 --> 01:38:06.082
"No working class are allowed
in the presence of his majesty."

01:38:06.166 --> 01:38:08.415
"No one is allowed outdoors
without a permission."

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.290
"By royal decree."

01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:14.457
Ms Ginger will be back soon.

01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:11.874
Whatever happens,

01:39:14.208 --> 01:39:15.624
we can't afford to fall out anymore.

01:39:17.666 --> 01:39:18.957
We've got to stick together.

01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:21.207
We must be on the same side.

01:39:52.291 --> 01:39:53.582
Who are we?

01:39:53.666 --> 01:39:54.999
Taiwanese!

01:39:55.083 --> 01:39:55.957
Where are we from?

01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.290
Taiwanese!

01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:58.457
Where are we from?

01:39:58.541 --> 01:39:59.957
Twa-Tiu-Tiann

01:40:00.041 --> 01:40:01.040
Where are we from?

01:40:01.125 --> 01:40:02.707
Twa-Tiu-Tiann

01:40:13.916 --> 01:40:19.624
"Let's prepare for the arrival
of Crown Prince Hirohito."

01:40:19.708 --> 01:40:23.999
"Every household hangs
out your Japanese flag."

01:40:24.083 --> 01:40:28.499
"Set off fireworks to celebrate."

01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:31.540
"Long live the Empire of Japan."

01:40:36.583 --> 01:40:39.582
<(Japanese song)
The snow of Mount Fuji...>

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:40.999
What are you doing here?

01:40:41.083 --> 01:40:45.457
Let's party officers.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.457
Let's drink.

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.457
Are you OK?

01:41:05.541 --> 01:41:06.207
You're drunk.

01:41:06.291 --> 01:41:07.540
So hot in here.

01:41:07.625 --> 01:41:09.082
Let's go outside.

01:41:18.583 --> 01:41:19.665
Here

01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:21.082
See if he's in here.

01:41:22.583 --> 01:41:25.832
Doctor...

01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:27.207
Doctor...

01:41:30.375 --> 01:41:32.165
What are you doing here?

01:41:33.958 --> 01:41:36.499
Open it, quick!

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:38.582
Doctor..

01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:40.290
Quick

01:41:40.375 --> 01:41:43.082
I got the keys...

01:41:44.791 --> 01:41:45.874
Done.

01:41:47.416 --> 01:41:48.124
Careful.

01:41:49.166 --> 01:41:50.249
Doctor.

01:41:52.625 --> 01:41:53.582
Careful.

01:41:58.916 --> 01:41:59.790
Let's hurry.

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:04.415
Jack.

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:05.540
Go!

01:42:07.166 --> 01:42:07.790
Where're the others?

01:42:07.875 --> 01:42:08.915
Already waiting outside

01:42:10.333 --> 01:42:11.165
Let's go.

01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:13.207
Stop.

01:42:20.541 --> 01:42:24.790
Fellow citizens, unite together.

01:42:31.958 --> 01:42:33.749
Boss, they're here.

01:42:38.375 --> 01:42:40.040
So many?!

01:42:42.583 --> 01:42:44.999
(Korean)
No hot-blooded Koreans would miss

01:42:45.083 --> 01:42:47.832
the opportunity to sabotage the royal visit.

01:42:50.833 --> 01:42:51.957
Thank you.

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:54.290
Nonsense.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.999
Not me you should thank.

01:42:58.541 --> 01:42:59.540
Who then?

01:43:02.791 --> 01:43:05.374
Thank you, Dr. Chiang Wei Shui.

01:43:05.458 --> 01:43:06.415
You got it.

01:43:06.875 --> 01:43:08.374
Yes.

01:43:09.125 --> 01:43:10.415
Give it to me.

01:43:11.916 --> 01:43:12.874
Boss.

01:43:21.625 --> 01:43:24.624
Why do I always have to deal with this shit?

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.707
Don't even know if they can do it.

01:43:29.083 --> 01:43:31.457
Lose those two useless fatsos back there.

01:43:32.458 --> 01:43:34.457
It's hot, what's this candle for?

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:37.249
You asked for the candle.

01:43:37.333 --> 01:43:39.249
You said it'd look better.

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:51.290
Stop it now.

01:43:52.625 --> 01:43:53.665
Anyway

01:43:54.541 --> 01:43:56.707
The Korean assassins have been hired

01:43:57.166 --> 01:43:58.957
to kill the crown prince.

01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:01.957
How could it be?

01:44:03.291 --> 01:44:04.249
Doctor,

01:44:05.458 --> 01:44:06.999
They are framing you!

01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:13.249
We must protect the prince.

01:44:14.666 --> 01:44:16.040
If they succeed,

01:44:16.958 --> 01:44:18.499
We'll never clear our names

01:44:19.791 --> 01:44:21.832
We need a big crowd.

01:44:21.916 --> 01:44:25.457
The bigger the crowd,
the more difficult for them to do it.

01:44:28.041 --> 01:44:29.040
Tomorrow?

01:44:30.333 --> 01:44:31.915
From what I've heard

01:44:32.375 --> 01:44:33.915
there won't be much of a crowd tomorrow

01:44:34.333 --> 01:44:37.249
I'm afraid.

01:44:56.791 --> 01:44:58.540
Think of something, quick!

01:45:00.083 --> 01:45:01.999
What to do?

01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:03.874
This is highly dangerous.

01:45:06.583 --> 01:45:07.540
Wait!

01:45:09.083 --> 01:45:09.915
I got it!

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.540
Hey, Missus.

01:45:13.458 --> 01:45:16.499
You must come tomorrow, for the parade.

01:45:17.041 --> 01:45:18.332
If you bring 10 people along with you.

01:45:18.416 --> 01:45:21.040
You'll have a long blessed life.

01:45:21.125 --> 01:45:22.665
If you can't have 10 with you.

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:29.874
You'll have the City God to answer to

01:45:29.958 --> 01:45:33.540
and be in trouble your whole life.

01:45:40.625 --> 01:45:42.207
Hurry along.

01:45:42.583 --> 01:45:43.624
Hey, Mister.

01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:46.374
Come to the welcome parade tomorrow

01:45:46.458 --> 01:45:47.915
and make sure you tell 10 people about it.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.207
I'm on my way.

01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:55.707
You'll be in big trouble if you don't.

01:45:58.625 --> 01:46:01.540
Listen to me, you must come, tomorrow

01:46:01.625 --> 01:46:03.124
and must tell 10 more about this

01:46:03.208 --> 01:46:04.457
if you want to be blessed.

01:46:04.541 --> 01:46:05.499
Don't blame anyone if you get cursed

01:46:05.583 --> 01:46:08.040
(muttering gibberish)

01:46:08.125 --> 01:46:08.874
What's that?

01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:11.749
I've done my ten.

01:46:11.833 --> 01:46:14.624
Ten? I thought it was 20.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.832
Stop messing around.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.915
20?! Got to go.

01:46:31.041 --> 01:46:33.082
We'll make it.

01:46:33.166 --> 01:46:33.624
OK?

01:46:33.708 --> 01:46:34.207
OK.

01:46:34.291 --> 01:46:35.040
Let's get moving.

01:46:38.500 --> 01:46:39.915
Missus, don't forget, 10.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.874
What now?

01:46:41.958 --> 01:46:44.374
Need more..

01:46:45.708 --> 01:46:46.957
Hey, listen to me.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.124
Or you'll be cursed.

01:46:56.208 --> 01:46:57.040
Run along

01:46:57.125 --> 01:46:59.082
Quick

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:06.082
Yeah, I've done 10.

01:47:07.875 --> 01:47:09.624
Now the wheels are turning.

01:47:41.291 --> 01:47:42.540
Everyone, step back.

01:47:45.916 --> 01:47:48.874
Keep quiet, no disruption.

01:47:49.583 --> 01:47:51.332
Back off, back.

01:47:51.416 --> 01:47:53.249
Step back.
- Hurry.

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:54.165
Step back.

01:48:06.583 --> 01:48:07.582
You?!

01:48:10.250 --> 01:48:11.790
Escaped from prison?

01:48:13.708 --> 01:48:16.249
That's one more charge against you.

01:48:17.041 --> 01:48:18.582
You set the doctor up!

01:48:23.208 --> 01:48:23.957
Doctor!

01:48:25.208 --> 01:48:26.582
They've got everyone off the street

01:48:27.916 --> 01:48:29.915
bad news for the prince.

01:48:35.083 --> 01:48:36.582
Listen to me!

01:48:43.208 --> 01:48:47.290
Have you smelt the sweet aroma of tea?

01:48:47.375 --> 01:48:48.540
Have you?

01:48:49.125 --> 01:48:53.040
Have you smelled
the wonderful scent of pineapple?

01:48:54.208 --> 01:48:57.790
That's us, the scent of Taiwan.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.749
We grow the best tea in the world.

01:49:05.833 --> 01:49:07.874
Even the Chinese buy tea from us.

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:09.915
Demand's so great, we hardly have enough.

01:49:11.208 --> 01:49:14.207
But the icing on the cake is,

01:49:14.291 --> 01:49:16.082
our baseball team

01:49:16.166 --> 01:49:18.957
will win the world championship one day.

01:49:19.291 --> 01:49:20.999
In 100 years,

01:49:22.541 --> 01:49:24.957
we'll build

01:49:25.041 --> 01:49:28.124
the tallest building in the world.

01:49:31.125 --> 01:49:32.499
We must believe in ourselves.

01:49:32.916 --> 01:49:34.332
The Japanese

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:37.165
are stopping us.

01:49:37.708 --> 01:49:38.749
Fine.

01:49:40.791 --> 01:49:42.999
We just need to stand up,

01:49:43.833 --> 01:49:46.165
and work together

01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:49.249
and we'll show the Japanese!

01:49:51.041 --> 01:49:53.499
So, let's stand together

01:49:53.583 --> 01:49:56.249
and shock the world.

01:49:56.625 --> 01:49:57.415
That's right!

01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.415
We're no dumb slaves.

01:49:59.666 --> 01:50:01.457
We must let them know

01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:02.915
we're no second class citizens!

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.040
That's right!

01:50:04.125 --> 01:50:07.999
The world is ours, we just need to speak up.

01:50:08.791 --> 01:50:30.040
Fellow citizens, unite together!

01:50:30.708 --> 01:50:33.749
His majesty is here!

01:50:43.958 --> 01:50:46.540
Back, step back.

01:50:48.083 --> 01:50:50.665
Hurry, step back.

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.499
What's that?
- Take this pineapple.

01:51:14.583 --> 01:51:15.790
I don't want it,

01:51:15.875 --> 01:51:17.707
Take it, it might come in handy.

01:51:47.291 --> 01:51:48.999
Try steal my girlfriend again!

01:52:03.958 --> 01:52:04.915
Jack!

01:52:15.291 --> 01:52:16.790
Jack!

01:52:28.791 --> 01:52:29.374
Jack!

01:52:29.458 --> 01:52:30.415
Hold tight!

01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:31.040
Jack!

01:52:31.125 --> 01:52:32.415
Hold tight!

01:52:33.333 --> 01:52:34.415
Jack!

01:52:53.250 --> 01:52:54.832
Mister, are you alright?

01:52:54.916 --> 01:52:56.040
Are you OK?

01:52:56.125 --> 01:52:57.874
(Japanese) Beautiful!

01:52:57.958 --> 01:53:01.040
Excuse me, no photos.

01:53:02.083 --> 01:53:03.249
Rose!

01:53:04.083 --> 01:53:06.207
Rose, you alright?

01:53:06.791 --> 01:53:07.624
I'm fine.

01:53:13.375 --> 01:53:15.332
No flash, thank you.

01:53:15.416 --> 01:53:17.874
No flash.

01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:18.874
Master Pig!

01:53:32.958 --> 01:53:33.665
What day is it today?

01:53:34.375 --> 01:53:35.624
What day is it today?

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.665
23rd of June.

01:53:41.916 --> 01:53:42.790
Where are we?

01:53:42.875 --> 01:53:43.874
We're here.

01:53:43.958 --> 01:53:45.582
In TTT.

01:53:47.875 --> 01:53:49.082
What?

01:53:49.166 --> 01:53:49.874
What's that?

01:53:49.958 --> 01:53:53.790
That's called a motorbike...

01:53:53.875 --> 01:53:55.582
We need to hurry.
- And this?

01:53:59.041 --> 01:53:59.790
Rose!

01:53:59.875 --> 01:54:02.499
Careful.

01:54:11.875 --> 01:54:13.207
And that?

01:54:13.291 --> 01:54:15.332
That's Taipei 101,
the tallest building in the world.

01:54:17.458 --> 01:54:20.290
If they'd killed the prince,
history would've changed

01:54:20.375 --> 01:54:21.999
and the future would be damned.

01:54:22.541 --> 01:54:23.915
The future?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.332
I mean now.

01:54:25.541 --> 01:54:26.915
Is it any different?

01:54:34.875 --> 01:54:35.874
This way.

01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:40.457
<We've got the power to change our future.>

01:54:44.250 --> 01:54:45.207
Master Pig!

01:54:45.625 --> 01:54:46.332
That's him.

01:54:48.041 --> 01:54:48.999
Hurry.

01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:50.915
Watch out.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.999
Is that a motorbike, too?

01:54:52.083 --> 01:54:53.499
No, that's...

01:54:54.791 --> 01:54:56.207
a skateboard.

01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.749
That year,

01:54:58.833 --> 01:55:00.624
Dr. Chiang's plan

01:55:01.375 --> 01:55:03.665
the parade-turned-petition

01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:05.249
was a huge success.

01:55:06.416 --> 01:55:10.415
Despite some minor incidents.

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:13.832
The Japanese Crown Prince

01:55:14.125 --> 01:55:16.999
had indeed heard their voices.

01:55:17.083 --> 01:55:19.749
Now let's watch a documentary.

01:55:34.083 --> 01:55:45.957
Freedom! Equality!

01:55:55.458 --> 01:56:00.790
Freedom! Equality!

01:56:04.125 --> 01:56:05.957
Fellow citizens!

01:56:07.083 --> 01:56:08.707
Fellow citizens!

01:56:08.791 --> 01:56:10.082
Unite Together!

01:56:10.166 --> 01:56:13.499
Fellow citizens, unite together!

01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:35.040
<Blossom fell in the dirt, >

01:56:35.125 --> 01:56:40.624
<who is there to care for it?>

01:56:40.708 --> 01:56:46.165
<The merciless rain
and wind stand in my way of success.>

01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:52.207
<What to do
when the blossom is in the dirt.>

01:57:12.916 --> 01:57:17.957
<Rain is falling, >

01:57:18.041 --> 01:57:23.124
<it drowns me in the pond of suffering.>

01:57:23.208 --> 01:57:28.582
<Why the blossom gets severed
from the leaves and trees>

01:57:28.666 --> 01:57:33.749
<and left deserted for no one to see.>

01:57:33.833 --> 01:57:39.165
<Why the blossom gets severed
from the leaves and trees>

01:57:39.250 --> 01:57:42.124
<and left deserted for no one to see.>

01:58:04.875 --> 01:58:06.165
Made up your mind?

01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:08.082
Let's do it.

01:58:15.708 --> 01:58:16.915
I'm staying here.

01:58:26.583 --> 01:58:28.499
I wanted to go with you.

01:58:33.875 --> 01:58:34.874
Truth is,

01:58:37.416 --> 01:58:39.540
I like the way I was very much.

01:58:40.875 --> 01:58:42.207
I was brave, and reckless.

01:58:45.666 --> 01:58:46.624
But,

01:58:47.708 --> 01:58:49.957
that's your golden age.

01:58:51.166 --> 01:58:52.249
Not mine.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.499
So I've decided to stay,

01:58:57.625 --> 01:58:59.707
and create my own golden age.

01:59:02.416 --> 01:59:03.999
I want to tell more people

01:59:04.375 --> 01:59:06.040
about our history.

01:59:30.333 --> 01:59:31.832
You call the shots.

01:59:55.916 --> 01:59:57.499
Think twice.

01:59:58.416 --> 01:59:59.415
One click.

01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:00.915
She's gone.

02:00:02.458 --> 02:00:04.207
And you'll never get

02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:08.290
a girlfriend as pretty as she is.

02:00:11.875 --> 02:00:13.457
See you again.

02:00:17.875 --> 02:00:18.999
See you again.

02:00:29.916 --> 02:00:32.957
Goodbye, Jack.

02:00:38.166 --> 02:00:40.957
Come back soon.

02:00:43.791 --> 02:00:45.457
Don't forget us.

02:01:02.875 --> 02:01:03.874
She's gone.

02:01:08.791 --> 02:01:10.249
That's not too bad.

02:01:11.208 --> 02:01:12.207
You love her,

02:01:12.291 --> 02:01:13.707
and she loves you.

02:01:15.125 --> 02:01:16.957
Whereas me,

02:01:17.208 --> 02:01:19.915
I love Ginger to bits.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.915
But she doesn't care about me at all.

02:01:22.833 --> 02:01:24.915
I don't even know if she's dead or alive.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.374
Not sure if they can save her.

02:01:36.333 --> 02:01:37.540
Ms Ginger!

02:01:40.458 --> 02:01:41.665
Ms Ginger!

02:01:42.541 --> 02:01:44.165
Ms Ginger, you're alive!

02:01:44.250 --> 02:01:45.457
Ms Ginger!

02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:49.540
Jack.

02:01:50.458 --> 02:01:51.124
That's enough.

02:01:54.708 --> 02:01:55.915
That's enough.

02:01:58.500 --> 02:01:59.540
It hurts!

02:02:01.708 --> 02:02:02.415
Ms Ginger!

02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:04.207
What are you doing?

02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:05.957
Hugging her so tight.

02:02:06.041 --> 02:02:07.415
Don't you know she's recovering?

02:02:07.541 --> 02:02:08.957
I'm sorry.

02:02:09.041 --> 02:02:10.332
And you.

02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:13.290
I was the one who saved you.

02:02:13.875 --> 02:02:15.957
And you're hugging HIM?

02:02:16.041 --> 02:02:18.624
It's so unfair.

02:02:20.125 --> 02:02:22.957
Get out of my sight.

02:02:23.041 --> 02:02:24.665
Better yet. Go get a room.

02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:26.207
Nonsense.

02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:29.332
He's just like my son.

02:02:31.333 --> 02:02:32.499
Besides,

02:02:34.166 --> 02:02:35.499
I'm not going back.

02:02:36.458 --> 02:02:37.540
Not going back?

02:02:37.625 --> 02:02:38.999
Where will you go then?

02:02:42.666 --> 02:02:44.249
Wherever you go,

02:02:45.166 --> 02:02:46.332
I'll go too.

02:02:51.166 --> 02:02:52.999
Really? You're not just saying that?

02:02:53.083 --> 02:02:53.832
Really.

02:02:53.916 --> 02:02:55.582
Don't lie and break my heart.

02:02:55.666 --> 02:02:59.290
I'm too old to have a broken heart.

02:03:00.083 --> 02:03:01.249
Not old at all.

02:03:02.416 --> 02:03:03.374
Really?

02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:04.665
Let's go.

02:03:06.791 --> 02:03:09.540
Jack, don't you come knocking.

02:03:09.958 --> 02:03:11.832
Nonsense.

02:03:53.041 --> 02:03:56.790
The flower of youth, is the blooming rose.

02:05:33.375 --> 02:05:34.415
Hey, look.

02:05:35.166 --> 02:05:36.499
Let me have a go.

02:05:36.875 --> 02:05:37.957
How much did you pay for that?

02:05:38.041 --> 02:05:38.582
How much?

02:05:38.666 --> 02:05:40.207
Guo.

02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:41.624
Black!

02:05:43.250 --> 02:05:44.415
How's everyone?!

02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:45.832
Why do you talk like my grandpa?

02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:49.374
I've missed you all!

02:05:54.333 --> 02:05:55.332
Dropping out from college?

02:05:55.416 --> 02:05:57.124
We're not really the brainy type.

02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:01.374
So we've decided to go home,

02:06:02.083 --> 02:06:03.749
and learn how to grow organic vegetables.

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:08.332
I'm going on a working holiday
to Australia, too.

02:06:08.833 --> 02:06:11.874
You won't be able to come
to my book signing then.

02:06:11.958 --> 02:06:14.124
That's if your book ever gets published.

02:06:14.208 --> 02:06:15.957
Don't say that.

02:06:16.833 --> 02:06:19.082
Never say never.

02:06:19.458 --> 02:06:21.290
Just go for it.

02:06:21.375 --> 02:06:22.832
Right? Jack?

02:06:24.333 --> 02:06:26.915
You've changed a lot!

02:06:27.625 --> 02:06:29.749
You're the one who's changed.

02:06:32.875 --> 02:06:35.249
Yes, never say never.

02:06:36.333 --> 02:06:37.582
Just go for it.

02:06:38.041 --> 02:06:41.290
Just go for it.

02:07:28.041 --> 02:07:28.999
This way, Ginger.

02:07:29.791 --> 02:07:31.749
Take a seat.

02:07:31.833 --> 02:07:33.124
I'm so happy.

02:07:33.708 --> 02:07:35.915
You've finally accepted me.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:40.665
I don't feel quite right though.

02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:41.707
Something wrong?

02:07:41.791 --> 02:07:42.707
I know...

02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:46.082
you're still recovering.

02:07:46.166 --> 02:07:47.040
Don't worry.

02:07:47.125 --> 02:07:50.374
I'll be gentle.

02:07:53.875 --> 02:07:55.499
You wait here.

02:07:55.583 --> 02:07:56.874
I'll go take a shower.

02:07:57.333 --> 02:07:58.832
And wash myself clean

02:07:58.916 --> 02:08:00.374
especially for you.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:01.999
Go ahead.

02:08:12.708 --> 02:08:14.749
Third time brushing my teeth.

02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:19.624
Cologne.

02:08:21.583 --> 02:08:24.040
This is the happiest day of my life!

02:08:24.125 --> 02:08:25.624
I'm getting married!

02:08:26.083 --> 02:08:27.957
Ginger says yes!

02:08:30.125 --> 02:08:31.082
Ginger?

02:08:33.250 --> 02:08:35.249
Who are you? What are you doing here?

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.124
Who am I? I'm Ginger.

02:08:38.583 --> 02:08:39.499
You're Ginger?

02:08:39.583 --> 02:08:40.457
Yes.

02:08:40.541 --> 02:08:41.707
It can't be.

02:08:42.083 --> 02:08:43.249
Nonsense.

02:08:44.958 --> 02:08:46.624
Haven't you heard about

02:08:46.708 --> 02:08:49.207
the side effects of

02:08:49.291 --> 02:08:52.165
time travel?

02:08:53.333 --> 02:08:56.082
Time travel turns Ginger into a granny?

02:08:56.166 --> 02:08:57.707
What granny?

02:08:58.500 --> 02:08:59.374
Come on.

02:08:59.458 --> 02:09:01.749
I'm all yours now.

02:09:02.166 --> 02:09:03.415
Come on.

02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:05.707
Let's see.

02:09:06.833 --> 02:09:08.915
Isn't this nice.

02:09:12.416 --> 02:09:14.374
Director, you lied to me!

02:09:19.125 --> 02:09:20.582
Come on, don't be shy.
