<i>I don't see why it</i>
<i>has to be this way.</i>

00:04.100 --> 00:06.300
There are plenty
of good schools in the area.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.200
I know. And I have a nice room
and I could meet a nice boy.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.600
And we could get married
and live in my nice room.

00:11.600 --> 00:15.100
- He'd have to be smallish.
- And have sweet little babies
that can sleep in the drawer.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.200
I do not see a downside
to this plan.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.000
Daddy, I love you like pancakes,
but I'm getting the hell out of here.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.900
- Language.
- She should say it.

00:21.900 --> 00:23.900
That's where she's going...
Hell-A.

00:23.900 --> 00:27.900
It's Los Angeles.
The City of Angels, remember?

00:27.900 --> 00:30.000
And if you meet one angel there,
I'll eat the dogs.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Bunch of junkies and spoiled movie actors.
That's who you're gonna meet.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.400
In the graduate
physics program at UCLA?

00:35.400 --> 00:38.300
- You don't know.
- Sweetie, why don't you check
the Chevy one more time.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.400
Chevy's fine.
I slept in a drawer till I was three.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.600
Didn't stunt me none.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.200
- Oh, did you call Bethany? Is it still okay?
- Late as you like.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.800
She says they'll leave you a key
in case they turn in.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.100
I know I'm forgetting something.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.200
Well, you just call us up,
we'll drive it up to you, move in. No problem.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.100
<i>- Mom.</i>
- I'm just scaring you.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.100
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll call you lots.</i>

01:00.100 --> 01:03.300
- I know you will.
- [Gasps] Feigenbaum.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.900
I can't make the trip
without Feigenbaum.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.700
He doesn't quite look up to it.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.400
Hush. He's the master of chaos.
He'll love L.A.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.800
- All my junkie movie actor friends.
- Don't you joke.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.100
Now, you're gonna promise me
that you're gonna be careful.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.100
I'm gonna study, Mom.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.000
I'm gonna learn every damn thing
they know up there...

01:23.000 --> 01:26.100
and then figure out
some stuff they don't.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.200
And I'll be careful.

01:28.200 --> 01:33.000
I'll even be dull, boring.
Cross my heart.

- [Cocks Gun]

01:55.300 --> 01:58.900
- I think we got the nest.
- The others are finishing a sweep.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.900
Nasty little buggers.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.100
Kinda cool physiologically.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.100
They reproduce
by vomiting up crystals...

02:05.100 --> 02:08.400
that attract and mutate the microbes
around them to form eggs.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.800
Are you trying to turn me on?

02:11.900 --> 02:15.200
It is kind of romantic.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.300
A roaring fire.
A snug little nest.

02:25.500 --> 02:29.100
<i>[Spike] Fuss, fuss.</i>
<i>The thing was about to strike.</i>

02:29.100 --> 02:32.800
- It was on your back. What was I supposed to do?
- Ask me to turn around.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.500
- Heat of battle. Wasn't time.
- You just like stabbing me.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.100
L-I'm shocked!
Shocked that you'd say that.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.000
I much prefer hitting you
with blunt instruments.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.700
You know, we only asked you along
because we felt sorry for you.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.700
If it weren't for me, you'd be bug food,
so stop whinging.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.600
- Angel?
- I'll be all right, Fred.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.100
No, I just want the bug.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.700
It's in pretty good shape,
and I'd like to take it back to the lab.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.500
Always like a new specimen.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.300
[Thud]

03:06.800 --> 03:08.800
Whoa. Uh...

03:09.800 --> 03:11.800
What's this?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.200
- Delivery.
- Ancient Relics is two floors down.

<i>Invoice reads Science Department.</i>
<i>Winifred Burkle.</i>

03:18.900 --> 03:21.500
- Do you need me to sign?
<i>- Been signed.</i>

03:23.900 --> 03:25.800
Okay.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.400
We're three little maids
who all unwary

04:28.400 --> 04:30.400
Come from a ladies' seminary

04:30.400 --> 04:33.900
Freed from its genius tutelary

04:33.900 --> 04:37.300
Three little maids from school
Three little maids

04:37.300 --> 04:43.200
And you don't stop with all the ladies
and the gangsta butt go...

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
- What's up?
- I should ask you.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.300
- You seem unutterably cheery.
- I am.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.700
I am. Look. I gotta
be straight with you...

04:50.700 --> 04:52.900
'cause this is kinda
blowing my mind.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.800
- Tell me.
- Fred and I are getting back together.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.400
She was so keyed up from last night's fight,
she asked me over.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.800
We ended up talking for hours
like old times.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.200
All of a sud... I can't even keep this up,
'cause your face is gonna make me weep.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.200
Wes, I am so messing with you.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.800
- [Chuckles]
- L... Oh. No, l...

05:11.800 --> 05:14.700
Come on. Brother gets a dig in?
That's my right.

05:14.700 --> 05:17.900
- So, you know about...
- It's on every BlackBerry in the building.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.900
No secrets in the House of Pain.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.500
And is that all right
with you... Fred and me?

05:25.200 --> 05:29.000
Last year, you wouldn't have asked me that
question. The man becomes civilized.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.500
<i>It's cool.</i>

05:31.500 --> 05:35.400
Our thing's long done,
and I know how you feel about her.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.300
Thank you.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.200
And to add
the necessary boilerplate...

05:39.200 --> 05:41.600
you ever hurt her,
I'm gonna kill you like a chicken.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.400
Acceptable terms.

05:43.400 --> 05:46.600
<i>- Now, on to the real fun.</i>
<i>- Yes, you seemed like something was up...</i>

05:46.600 --> 05:49.300
before you made that tasteless
and horrible joke at my expense.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.300
Lindsey McDonald.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.800
- You know where he is?
- Settle for "was"?

05:53.800 --> 05:55.900
He can hide from the senior partners,
but not from the D.W. P <i>...</i>

05:55.900 --> 05:59.900
- and not from my many, many ears.
- He was living here.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.300
Under the name Doyle. The way
he was messing with Spike and Angel...

06:02.300 --> 06:04.200
could be he had
some other schemes laid out.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.300
Senior partners
took him out fast.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.500
- I don't even think he had time to pack.
- Worth checking.

06:08.500 --> 06:12.500
- Nice work. You should tell Angel.
- You can tell him.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.700
- I ain't going in there.
- It's bollocks, Angel!

06:15.700 --> 06:18.200
It's your brand of bollocks
from first to last.

06:18.200 --> 06:21.900
You can't ever see the big picture.
You can't see any picture.

06:21.900 --> 06:25.200
I am talking
about something primal, all right?

06:25.200 --> 06:27.600
Savagery.
Brutal animal instinct.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.500
And that wins out
every time with you.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.500
You know, the human race
has evolved, Spike.

06:31.500 --> 06:35.200
Oh, into a bunch of namby-pamby,
self-analyzing wankers...

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
- who could never overcome aggressors...
- We're bigger, smarter...

06:37.200 --> 06:39.900
plus there's a thing teamwork,
not to mention the superstitious terror...

06:39.900 --> 06:42.600
- of your pure aggressors.
- You just want it to be
the way you want it to be.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.900
- It's not about what I want.
<i>- [Wesley] Sorry.</i>

06:45.900 --> 06:48.100
Is this something
we should all be discussing?

06:49.400 --> 06:51.300
No.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.100
It just sounds a little serious.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.000
It was mostly...
theoretical. We...

06:59.000 --> 07:00.800
We were just working out a...

07:02.200 --> 07:04.900
Look. If cavemen and astronauts
got into a fight...

07:04.900 --> 07:06.700
who would win?

07:08.900 --> 07:10.400
Huh.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.700
You've been yelling at each other
for 40 minutes about this.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.100
- Do the astronauts have weapons?
- [Both] No.

07:23.100 --> 07:26.200
I couldn't find
any invoice on it.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.100
I thought maybe
you went crazy on eBay.

07:28.100 --> 07:31.500
No, no eBay.
After the commemorative plate incident...

07:31.500 --> 07:34.200
I'm living clean.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.100
Did you run a spectral analysis?

07:36.100 --> 07:41.000
Yeah. Everything's bouncing off it,
which doesn't thrill me.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.300
Yeah, let's not be hasty about opening it.
It's probably just a mummy.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.900
Mummies can be
a lot more trouble than you think.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.300
And you're seeing Wesley now.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.600
Uh, oh. Okay.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.300
Uh, that's not connected
to mummies in some way.

07:57.300 --> 08:00.200
No. I just wanted
to get it out there.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.800
Uh, and I'm totally good with it.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.800
L... You know, I know I've made,
uh, advances.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.400
L-I'm sorry.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.900
No. I didn't want to
make you uncomfortable.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.800
I love working with you,
and that's plenty for me.

08:18.800 --> 08:20.800
You're sweet.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.000
Want me to get
our HazMats on this baby?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.800
Yeah. And, uh, see about
where it came from.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.900
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

08:51.200 --> 08:54.300
[Gasps, Coughing]

08:57.100 --> 08:59.000
What happened?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.900
Oh, I don't know.
It opened, and there was air.

09:02.900 --> 09:06.900
- Are you okay?
- Uh, I think so. That was odd.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.800
Harmony just pulled me out of
a very promising poker game...

09:12.800 --> 09:15.200
down in Accounts Receivable,
so this better be good.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.800
Oh, and by the way,
all the guys down there agree...

09:17.800 --> 09:20.400
that astronauts don't stand a chance
against cavemen...

09:20.400 --> 09:22.300
so don't even start.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.900
Look. I can't
do this anymore.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.900
<i>Admitting defeat, are you?</i>

09:26.900 --> 09:28.800
You and me,
this isn't working out.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.900
Are you saying we should start
annoying other people?

09:31.900 --> 09:34.000
I'm saying you should go.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.600
You really can't stand
the competition, can you?

09:36.600 --> 09:38.500
That isn't the...

09:38.500 --> 09:42.500
The way I figure it is that Lindsey
brought you back as a spirit...

09:42.500 --> 09:46.500
bound to this place
so you'd become... invested in it.

09:46.700 --> 09:51.200
<i>He only made you corporeal again</i>
<i>once you'd gotten used to it, attached to it.</i>

09:51.200 --> 09:55.200
I'm not attached.
I just don't have anywhere else to go.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.600
What if you did?
Look. Wolfram and Hart...

09:57.600 --> 10:00.300
has got offices
in every major city in the world...

10:00.300 --> 10:02.400
and a lot more out of it.

10:02.400 --> 10:06.200
I'll give you the resources you need to go
anywhere... cars, gadgets, expense accounts.

10:06.200 --> 10:10.000
<i>You fight the good fight,</i>
<i>but in style.</i>

10:10.300 --> 10:13.200
And, if possible,
in Outer Mongolia.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.400
A roving agent.

10:16.400 --> 10:20.400
Sort of a 007
without the poncey tux.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.400
- Go anywhere I want?
- Anywhere. Everywhere.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.500
Hmm.
Anywhere but here.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.800
<i>But that doesn't</i>
<i>make any sense.</i>

10:29.800 --> 10:32.700
- I just call it like I see it.
- But the cavemen have fire.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.600
That's what they live with
in their caves.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.700
The astronauts should at least
have some sort of weapon.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.200
Hey there.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.600
I was just on my way to thinking
of an excuse to come and see you.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.700
And how is that working out?

10:43.700 --> 10:46.200
Really great.
Where you coming from?

10:46.200 --> 10:48.900
Oh, Medical. I breathed
some old mummy dust.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.100
Had to make sure
I didn't discover any new germs.

10:51.100 --> 10:55.000
- You all right.
- They shooed me right off. Mummy-free.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.100
Good. I was hoping
to take you out tomorrow night.

10:58.100 --> 11:00.000
And I don't feature you
wrapped in bandages.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.500
- Take me out where?
- Can it be a secret?

11:03.500 --> 11:07.400
Oh, sheesh.
Get a balcony, you two, huh?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
You'll still find me
for lunch though, right?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.300
I'll just look
where the sun shines.

11:11.300 --> 11:14.400
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
You make me happy

11:21.700 --> 11:25.700
Get Medical.
Someone get Medical now!

11:34.500 --> 11:37.100
[Chuckles]
It's my boys.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.200
Haven't had this many
big strapping men at my bedside...

11:42.200 --> 11:44.600
since that night
with the varsity lacrosse team.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.200
<i>[Chuckles]</i>
<i>That was a joke.</i>

11:50.200 --> 11:52.500
Well, you sure gave us all
a big scare, Freddles.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.000
Yeah, you just need to rest.
Lab's doing some blood work.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.200
- I'm a mummy, aren't I?
<i>- [Spike] I've fought plenty of mummies.</i>

11:58.200 --> 12:02.500
And none of them were as pretty as you.
Almost none.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.200
Now you all are being
too comforting.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.700
What's really up?

12:09.700 --> 12:11.800
You're sick, and you're making it worse
by worrying.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.600
We've got that sarcophagus
under the scope.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.800
<i>If it gave you anything,</i>
<i>we'll isolate it in a few hours.</i>

12:16.800 --> 12:19.500
So, you don't know what it is?

12:19.500 --> 12:20.900
Yet.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.200
- Okay.
- We're gonna work this.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.600
<i>Shouldn't take long.</i>

12:27.600 --> 12:29.900
Handsome man saves me.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.500
[Chuckles]
That's how it works.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.800
Let's get crackin'.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.100
He's such an old fogy.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.400
I know you've gotta
go be book man.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.700
Yes.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.900
Just hit that light.
I'll be here in a heartbeat.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Assuming I still have one.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.400
Hush.

13:16.800 --> 13:20.200
- Wes and Fred?
- You didn't know?

13:20.200 --> 13:22.000
I didn't know.

13:23.600 --> 13:26.300
- How's she handling it?
- She's smarter than all of us put together.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.200
- She knows it's bad.
- How bad? What do we know?

13:28.200 --> 13:31.200
Whatever she's got, it doesn't match up
with any of the pathogens in our archives.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.000
- It's mystical, and it's not ours.
- What about the sarcophagus?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.700
My team is cross-checking the symbols,
but it's also new territory for us.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.300
Angel, what exactly is happening to her?
You talked to the doctor.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.300
<i>- [Wesley] They have something?</i>
- Yeah, I, uh...

13:41.300 --> 13:45.200
Some parasitic agent
is working its way through...

13:45.200 --> 13:47.100
I mean, as near
as they can tell...

13:47.100 --> 13:49.000
Get to the point.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.400
Her organs are cooking.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.300
In a day's time, they'll liquefy.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.400
No, not this girl.
Not this day.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.300
Look, Wes.
You gotta tell me what was in that box.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.200
I need a name,
a history, anything.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.000
- We can't get it open. Not even the lasers...
- Where did it come from?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.400
It just showed up.
No return address.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.400
Didn't recognize the guy
who brought it in...

14:10.400 --> 14:12.300
come to think of it,
the middle of the night.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.400
- This was deliberate.
- Senior partners?

14:14.400 --> 14:17.300
It doesn't add up, but I'll hit
the White Room, talk to the conduit.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.700
All right, look.
If the senior partners didn't do this...

14:19.700 --> 14:21.600
- you gotta get them to help us.
<i>- [Gunn] Any way I can.</i>

14:21.600 --> 14:25.600
What about Doyle? Uh, Lindsey.
The man likes to play his games.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.200
I was looking to work the streets,
and we've got his address.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.700
For all we know,
he's probably sitting there, laughing.

14:30.700 --> 14:34.000
- If there's muscle work to do...
- Let's make it twice as fast.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.600
And baby makes three,
in case anybody feels like singing.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.700
- Good. Guys...
- You don't have to say it.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.300
I'll say it anyway.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.800
Winifred Burkle. Go.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.000
[Moaning]

14:59.500 --> 15:03.400
I'm sorry to interrupt. I just need to know
if the Holbein clan history was here.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.000
<i>- It was supposed to be faxed to my offiice.</i>
- It can wait.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.200
These guys are really important.
I just need...

15:09.200 --> 15:11.900
I mean, the whole company
can't be working Miss Burkle's case.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.900
- Of course.

Hello?

15:25.600 --> 15:28.000
Here, kitty, kitty?

15:28.000 --> 15:31.700
Look. I know there's someone in here,
and it ain't just me.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.000
I'm not going anywhere till...

15:42.400 --> 15:45.400
Well, what do you know?
It <i>is</i> just me.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.000
You don't wanna be here.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.600
I never wanna be here.
What happened to the cat?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.700
The physical form of the conduit
is determined by the viewer.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.400
So, I'm looking at me
because what?

16:01.400 --> 16:04.700
We're gonna play a mirror game?
Get our mime on?

16:04.700 --> 16:08.400
- You are failing.
- I'm not the issue here.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.400
I believe that you think that.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.800
You can't let this happen to Fred.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
This is the part
where I need to be clear.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.100
[Groaning]

16:21.100 --> 16:24.300

I am not your flunky.

Oh, yeah, they are not here
for your convenience.

16:31.600 --> 16:34.400
I didn't come for a favor.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.800
- We can make a deal.
- Deals are for the devil.

a life for hers... you'll get it.

Hiding out from
the senior partners, Eve?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.900
How many sick days do you get
before they dock you?

17:17.900 --> 17:20.500
- What do you want?
- Fred's dying.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.500
Some mystical parasite.
Ring a bell?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.400
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.800
What about your boyfriend, love?
He got some wacky scheme brewing?

17:28.800 --> 17:31.700
- Sending coffins about?
- You two stay away from me.

17:31.700 --> 17:34.900
Look, Eve.
This happens quickly or very, very slowly.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.500
Sarcophagus.
Older than anything we know.

17:37.500 --> 17:41.000
Lindsey and I had nothing to do with that.
I'm not lying. L-I'm not.

17:43.700 --> 17:48.600
Have you... heard from him?
About him?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.700
Oh, this is truly poetical.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.600
You're not saying
what we need to hear.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.000
Why would we do anything to Fred?
Why would we even care about...

17:56.000 --> 17:59.400
<i>Oh.! Oh, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>That was a knuckle-buster.</i>

17:59.400 --> 18:03.000

I'm Jake LaMotta over here. It's pathetic.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.500
Oh, here's the thing, Eve.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.900
You're going to sing for me,
and I'm going to read you right now.

18:07.900 --> 18:11.300
<i>And here's one more thing.</i>
<i>Winifred Burkle once told me...</i>

18:11.300 --> 18:14.900

and in lieu of absolutely nothing...

18:14.900 --> 18:17.300
"I think a lot of people
would choose to be green.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.300

If I hear one note,
one quarter note...

have time to kill you.

Yeah, and I might be now,

- Well, nothing's written in stone... lately...

19:19.700 --> 19:22.400

<i>- The ones that were still alive.</i>

they were killing each other all the time.

And they don't die
the way we do.

- A burial ground.

- No.

20:14.900 --> 20:17.400

Who is Feigenbaum?

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
I don't remember.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.100
[Sobbing]

26:09.800 --> 26:11.600
Shh.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.500
[Sobbing Continues]

26:31.500 --> 26:33.900
Is it terrible?

26:33.900 --> 26:37.000
At a time like this,
I'm worried about how crappy I look.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.600
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.500
Do you always like splotchy girls?

26:47.600 --> 26:49.600
It's my curse.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.400
[Sniffles]
Read to me.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
<i>The Dreadhost's Compendium</i>
<i>of Immortal Leeches?</i>

27:07.000 --> 27:08.800
[Chuckles]

27:11.100 --> 27:13.500
Can that be
any book in the world?

27:15.400 --> 27:17.500
Name one.

27:17.500 --> 27:23.000
"She was such a little girl that one did not
expect to see such a look on her small face.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.100
"It would have been an old look
for a child of 12...

27:26.100 --> 27:29.100
"and Sara Crewe
was only seven.

27:29.100 --> 27:33.900
"The fact was, however, that she was always
dreaming and thinking odd things...

27:33.900 --> 27:36.900
"and could not herself remember any time
when she had not been thinking...

27:36.900 --> 27:41.600
"things about grown-up people.
And the world they belonged to.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.400
<i>She felt as if she had lived</i>
<i>a long, long time. "</i>

27:48.000 --> 27:51.600
[Spike] When is a door not a door?
When it's not soddin' well there.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.400
Right there.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.400
<i>You wanna bet that's the entrance</i>
<i>to the Deeper Well?</i>

27:58.400 --> 28:01.000
Either that, or Christmasland.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.100
Do you ever have any fun?

28:04.700 --> 28:06.600
- [Growling]
- I'm about to.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.300
And they even brought us weapons.
Strategy?

28:09.300 --> 28:12.700
- Just hold my hand.
<i>- [Creatures Growling]</i>

28:12.700 --> 28:15.200
- Saint Petersburg.
- Thought you'd forgotten.

28:44.400 --> 28:48.400
- Damn it!
- No, don't say "Damn it."

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
You got me all up
in this Walt Disney mojo, don't say it's...

28:50.400 --> 28:52.900
They're impervious to the cold.

28:52.900 --> 28:58.500
The blood tissue freezes, but they just keep
working away, like it's a sunny day in L.A.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.600
L-I'm sorry.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.900
- Okay, so that's a bust. What else you got?
- I don't, um...

29:03.900 --> 29:07.100
God, I can't think,
I'm so nervous.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.100
Look. I'd never tell her this...

29:12.100 --> 29:16.100
but I care about Fred
more than l...

29:16.300 --> 29:18.100
She's like no one
I've met, you know?

29:19.700 --> 29:22.400
I do.

29:22.400 --> 29:27.000
Nothing would make me happier than to be
the white knight in this situation...

29:27.000 --> 29:29.800
and have her look at me
the way that...

29:32.100 --> 29:37.600
I mean, l-I don't just care about Fred.
L-I practically worship it.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.300
You said "it."

29:43.400 --> 29:46.700
- What?
- Not "her." You said, "I worship it."

29:50.500 --> 29:52.400
Oops.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.700
[Yells]

30:02.300 --> 30:05.400
Is that all?
We haven't even started.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.000
<i>- [Thunderclap]</i>
- I'd say that's enough.

30:09.700 --> 30:12.000
Drogyn.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.600
Angel.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.400
You're the keeper of the well.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.900
- Have been for decades.
- Well, who in the bloody...

30:20.900 --> 30:22.600
Do not ask me a question!

30:24.800 --> 30:27.500
If you ever ask me a single question,
I will kill you outright.

30:27.500 --> 30:29.400
Don't think for a moment
that I can't.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.500
- He can. He would.
- Eh?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
- You're here about Illyria.
- Yes.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.700
- Walk in.
- But how...

30:37.700 --> 30:39.900
What did I just say to you
not one moment ago?

30:39.900 --> 30:42.000
Don't...

30:42.000 --> 30:43.800
ask.

30:47.700 --> 30:49.800
Seriously, he doesn't
like questions.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.800
Why the bloody hell not?

30:51.800 --> 30:53.700
He can't lie.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.900
You did this!
You did all of this!

30:58.900 --> 31:02.100
Technically, that's not the case.
I just played my part.

31:02.100 --> 31:04.600
Why? You couldn't stand the thought
of Wes winning her, so you kill her?

31:04.600 --> 31:07.300
No. I meant everything
I said about her.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.000
I chose Fred because I love her.
Because she's worthy.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.700
You think I'd have my god
hatched out of some schmuck?

31:12.700 --> 31:14.900
What are...

31:14.900 --> 31:18.800
This was all set in motion
millions of years ago, Charles.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.800
And there's just no way to stop it.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.700
Angel and Spike.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.900
<i>Oh, they're really on track,</i>
<i>but it doesn't matter.</i>

31:24.900 --> 31:27.000
Angel's not gonna save her.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.200
- You don't know Angel.
- I'm not being clear.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.000
I don't mean that Angel
is going to fail to save her.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.900
I mean, he's gonna let her die.

31:46.900 --> 31:49.900
Would you read to me some more?

31:49.900 --> 31:51.800
Of course.

31:51.800 --> 31:56.100
[Groans]
Oh, the light hurts my eyes.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.300
But I don't want you
to turn it off.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.100
But it hurts my eyes.

32:05.100 --> 32:08.100
Everything's so bright and hollow.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.700
Cavemen win.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.500
Of course the cavemen win.

32:18.500 --> 32:20.400
I would never have thought
you'd end up here, Angel.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.400
- I could say the same.
- So you two know each other.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.600
That was a statement.
I already know that you do.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.400
I'll tell you as much as I can.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.400
The Old Ones were demons pure.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.500
They warred
as we would breathe, endlessly.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.900
The greater ones were interred,
for death was not always their end.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.400
Illyria was feared
and beloved, as few are.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.900
It was lain to rest
in the very depths of the well.

32:43.900 --> 32:45.800
Until it disappeared
a month ago.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.500
Someone took it from under your nose
a month ago, and you didn't miss it till now?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.900
That makes you
quite the crap jailer, doesn't it?

32:50.900 --> 32:53.000
<i>Also</i> a statement.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.900
Your friend likes to talk.

32:54.900 --> 32:56.800
So much, he's even
right sometimes.

32:56.800 --> 32:59.500
The man I remember
couldn't be stolen from so easily.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.300
The tomb was not stolen.
It disappeared.

33:02.300 --> 33:05.200
I believe it was predestined to
as part of Illyria's escape plan.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.600
And as for my not noticing...

33:09.600 --> 33:12.700
Well, my charges are not few.

33:20.900 --> 33:22.800
[Spike]
Bloody hell.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.000
- [Angel] How far does this go down?
- All the way.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.400
All the way through the Earth.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.600
So, the coffin disappeared,
teleported...

33:32.600 --> 33:34.700
but it was brought to us.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.800
Illyria was a great power.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.300
So great, that after
millions of years dead...

33:40.300 --> 33:44.100
somewhere on this Earth
it still has acolytes.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
There's only a few of us now.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.400
I came to L.A. Because I knew
that's where its kingdom had been.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.000
It was supposed to teleport
back to the base of its power...

33:52.000 --> 33:54.900
but the continents drifted,
which they do.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.200
I had others help me get it here,
but then it got stuck in...

33:57.200 --> 33:59.800
<i>would you believe it...</i>
<i>Customs.</i>

34:02.800 --> 34:04.600
But you took care of that.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.000
You signed the order to bring it into the lab,
so you could get another brain boost.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.100
It's like I said.
I'm just one small part...

34:19.100 --> 34:22.699
- of a great machine.
- Angel's gonna save her.

34:22.699 --> 34:26.000
What he's fighting against
is older than the concept of time.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.800
I couldn't stop it.
There's nothing left to do now but wait.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.000
Wait and try and figure out exactly
what you want to tell your...

34:42.300 --> 34:45.300
[Whimpering]

34:48.300 --> 34:51.300
Oh, God!
I've sinned!

34:51.300 --> 34:53.900
I've sinned,
and I'm being punished.

34:53.900 --> 34:56.900
<i>[Groaning]</i>
<i>I don't know what's wrong.</i>

34:56.900 --> 34:59.800
I never got a B-minus before.

34:59.800 --> 35:03.500
[Yells]
I'm sorry.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.400
I'm sorry.
Make it stop.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.300
[Gagging, Gasping]

35:10.300 --> 35:14.000
It's been freed,
the demon's essence.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah, it's been freed.
Why do you think we're here?

35:16.000 --> 35:18.100
And what's your favorite color?
What's your favorite song?

35:18.100 --> 35:20.100
Who's the goalkeeper
for Manchester United?

35:20.100 --> 35:23.200
How many fingers am I holding up?
You wanna kill me? Try.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.400
I don't have time for your quirks.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.900
The power to draw back
Illyria lies in there.

35:29.900 --> 35:34.300
It requires a champion who has traveled
from where it lies to where it belongs.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.800
- You got two of those right here.
- But I didn't know it was free.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.600
If we bring the sarcophagus
back to the well...

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
it will draw Illyria
out of your friend...

35:48.600 --> 35:53.300
and into every single person
between here and there.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.800
It will become
the mystical equivalent of airborne.

35:55.800 --> 36:00.500
<i>It will claw into every soul in its path</i>
<i>to keep from being trapped entire.</i>

36:00.500 --> 36:02.600
Tens, maybe
hundreds of thousands...

36:02.600 --> 36:07.600
will die in agony...
if you save her.

36:11.100 --> 36:12.900
No.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.400
That's madness.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.100
This is a place of madness.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.100
I'll prepare the spell.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.400
Your choice.

36:40.100 --> 36:42.600
Hell with the world.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.600
<i>[Labored Breathing]</i>

36:46.400 --> 36:50.200
Why did we go there?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.100
Why did we think
we could beat it?

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
It's evil, Wesley.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.900
It's bigger than anything.

36:58.900 --> 37:02.700
- I don't believe that.
- No! I'm with him!

37:05.100 --> 37:07.700
You won't leave me now?

37:09.000 --> 37:12.300
- We're so close.
- I will never leave you.

37:12.300 --> 37:15.100
Hmm.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.000
Oh!

37:17.000 --> 37:19.200
[Sighs]

37:19.200 --> 37:21.800
That was bad.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.400
But it's better now.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.400
You won't leave me?

37:27.400 --> 37:29.600
I won't.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.800
My boys.

37:35.300 --> 37:39.200
[Sobbing]
I walk with heroes.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.600
- Think about that.
- You are one.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.600
Superhero.

37:44.600 --> 37:49.500
[Sobbing]
And this is my power.

37:49.500 --> 37:54.100
Do not let them take me.
Not me.

37:55.600 --> 38:00.600
That's right.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.200
He's with me.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.300
Spike.

38:24.300 --> 38:27.000
This goes all the way through...

38:28.100 --> 38:29.900
to the other side.

38:33.700 --> 38:37.100
<i>So, I figure, there's a bloke...</i>

38:37.100 --> 38:41.400
somewhere around... New Zealand...

38:41.400 --> 38:44.100
standing on a bridge
like this one...

38:44.100 --> 38:45.900
Iooking back down at us.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.600
All the way down.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.900
There's a hole in the world.

38:56.200 --> 38:59.000
<i>Feels like we ought to have known.</i>

39:01.000 --> 39:03.500

39:03.500 --> 39:05.800
Will you kiss me?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.000
Would you have loved me?

39:29.500 --> 39:31.500
I've loved you...

39:31.500 --> 39:33.300
since I've known you.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.700
No, that's not...

39:37.700 --> 39:40.800
I think maybe even before.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.000
[Sniffles]
I'm so sorry.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.400
No, no, no.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.200
[Gasping, Coughing]

39:54.100 --> 39:57.800
I need you
to talk to my parents.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.200
Th-They have to know
I wasn't scared...

40:01.200 --> 40:03.300
and that it was quick.

40:04.300 --> 40:07.600
That I wasn't scared.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.100
- Oh, God!
- You have to fight.

40:10.100 --> 40:12.700
You don't have to talk.
Just concentrate on fighting.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.200
- Just hold on.
- I'm not scared.

40:16.200 --> 40:19.700
I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

Please, Wesley.
