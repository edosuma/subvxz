Madam President,

00:06.941 --> 00:08.443
joint chiefs of staff,

00:08.527 --> 00:10.069
Prime Minister Cho,

00:10.153 --> 00:13.948
it's truly an honor to be here
in the Oval Office,

00:14.032 --> 00:16.784
though I wish it were
under better circumstances.

00:16.868 --> 00:20.663
I just came back from a meeting
with the world's top scientists.

00:20.746 --> 00:22.207
They're all dead.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.208
The virus,

00:23.291 --> 00:24.750
it got them all.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.836
I was able to obtain a sample,

00:26.919 --> 00:28.254
but it's not in the vial.

00:30.382 --> 00:31.841
It's in my blood.

00:31.924 --> 00:34.386
Dr. Vincent, if it's in your blood,

00:34.469 --> 00:37.013
then that means the virus-- My God.

00:37.096 --> 00:39.474
Yes.

00:39.558 --> 00:40.850
The sickening...

00:45.688 --> 00:47.148
has begun.

00:47.232 --> 00:50.026
Thank you, Ben. Wow. Wow.

00:50.109 --> 00:51.903
Very powerful stuff, Dev.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.779
That pause you took after "the sickening"

00:53.863 --> 00:55.114
was phenomenal.

00:55.198 --> 00:56.699
Amazing pause--

00:56.782 --> 00:58.451
one of the best pauses
we've heard all day.

00:58.535 --> 01:00.870
Yeah, thank you so much for coming in.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.539
Thank you...

01:02.622 --> 01:03.540
for your time.

01:03.623 --> 01:04.874
Ohh!

01:06.251 --> 01:07.335
That's another pause.

01:09.128 --> 01:11.172
That was great.

01:11.256 --> 01:13.049
Now, our director's flying in next week.

01:13.132 --> 01:15.260
I definitely want to bring you in
for a session with him.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.636
My office will be in touch.

01:16.719 --> 01:17.887
Oh, that's great.

01:17.970 --> 01:20.348
Is there any word on who the leads
of the film might be?

01:20.432 --> 01:22.100
Between us,

01:22.183 --> 01:25.895
they're close on Colin Salmon
and Kerry Washington.

01:25.978 --> 01:27.606
And it looks like we're going with 50 Cent

01:27.688 --> 01:29.732
as the evil senator
who looks the other way.

01:29.815 --> 01:31.317
Ooh.

01:31.401 --> 01:34.404
So is this, like, a black virus movie?

01:34.487 --> 01:37.532
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

01:37.616 --> 01:40.118
Hey, so I got a callback
on that black virus movie.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.160
Could be cool.

01:41.244 --> 01:44.456
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.498
What? What's wrong?

01:45.582 --> 01:47.083
Ooh.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.711
I just realized
my calendar is not updating.

01:50.795 --> 01:52.213
Dr. Ramusami is visiting.

01:52.297 --> 01:54.715
I forgot to pick him up
in the train station.

01:54.799 --> 01:56.301
Uh-oh. That's cold.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.594
Friend's visiting you
all the way from India,

01:57.677 --> 01:58.886
seems like you should pick him up.

01:58.970 --> 02:01.598
I have all my appointments
in the calendar.

02:01.681 --> 02:03.766
In the morning, a ding comes.

02:03.849 --> 02:05.101
"Ding, ding."

02:05.184 --> 02:06.645
I plan my day.

02:06.727 --> 02:09.272
"Ding, ding." I see what I have to do.

02:09.355 --> 02:11.316
There was no "ding, ding" today.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.317
That's 'cause you got a new iPad.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.319
You have to transfer over
your appointments.

02:15.820 --> 02:18.114
Why don't the dings
transfer automatically?

02:18.197 --> 02:19.115
"Dings" is not a term.

02:19.198 --> 02:20.700
You got to stop saying "dings."

02:20.783 --> 02:21.951
The appointments
don't transfer automatically.

02:22.034 --> 02:23.828
You have to transfer them yourself.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.455

11:51.311 --> 11:53.355
I was just walking around
in Washington Square Park one day,

11:53.438 --> 11:54.732
and this guy came up to me

11:54.815 --> 11:56.316
and said they were trying to find
a minority

11:56.400 --> 11:57.526
for a Fruit by the Foot commercial,

11:57.609 --> 11:59.403
and I said yeah,
and I got paid pretty well,

11:59.486 --> 12:00.905
so I just kept doing more commercials.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.823
I fell into regular acting from that.

12:02.907 --> 12:04.950
Very good. You're making a good life.

12:05.034 --> 12:06.493
At your age, your father

12:06.577 --> 12:09.329
had barely stopped working
at the zipper factory.

12:09.413 --> 12:10.748
Zipper factory?

12:10.831 --> 12:13.667
Yep, I worked in zipper factory
for two years

12:13.751 --> 12:15.586
to get money to go to medical school.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.588
You never told me about that.

12:17.671 --> 12:20.174
Yes, your father worked very hard.

12:20.258 --> 12:22.593
You know the little tabs
that go on the end of the zipper

12:22.676 --> 12:23.969
that you pull?

12:24.053 --> 12:26.097
He made the holes in them.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.890
He was the best.

12:27.973 --> 12:29.808
If he didn't come to America,

12:29.892 --> 12:34.188
you would probably be working
in that same zipper factory now,

12:34.272 --> 12:35.522
making the holes.

12:35.606 --> 12:37.441
Instead, Dev lives in America,

12:37.524 --> 12:38.984
where his biggest problem
is that the Wi-Fi

12:39.068 --> 12:40.111
in his apartment is messed up.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.320
Hey, that's a serious issue.

12:41.403 --> 12:42.863
Remember trying to watch
that video of that guy

12:42.947 --> 12:44.073
who fell into his own wedding cake?

12:44.156 --> 12:45.490
That buffering took forever.

12:45.574 --> 12:47.285
I've seen that video clip!

12:47.367 --> 12:49.036
Very funny!

12:49.120 --> 12:51.580
Brian, can you send me the link, please?

12:51.663 --> 12:52.790
Sure.

12:52.873 --> 12:53.916
Why didn't you just ask me?

12:53.999 --> 12:56.210
I like Brian.

12:59.379 --> 13:06.386
♪ ♪

13:11.600 --> 13:14.603
Hey, Mason says,
"Happy Endings is poppin' off."

13:14.686 --> 13:16.021
His words. Should we go?

13:16.105 --> 13:17.689
Yeah.

13:17.773 --> 13:19.233
Man, that was pretty crazy,
what my dad was talking about,

13:19.317 --> 13:20.525
working in a zipper factory.

13:20.609 --> 13:21.735
I never knew that.

13:21.819 --> 13:23.904
You know stuff about your dad's backstory?

13:23.988 --> 13:26.157
I mean, I know the big points.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.491
He was poor.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.784
He was in another country.

13:28.867 --> 13:30.244
It was tough.

13:30.328 --> 13:31.536
Then he came here.

13:31.620 --> 13:33.622
I mean, you know, I got the gist of it.

13:33.705 --> 13:35.291
Isn't that the gist
of every immigrant's story,

13:35.374 --> 13:36.458
that it was hard?

13:36.541 --> 13:38.627
Shouldn't you care a little more,
being that he's your dad?

13:38.710 --> 13:40.921
Yeah, but, again, he doesn't talk much.

13:41.005 --> 13:42.756
I once found a photo of him
in the military.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.716
And he just goes, "Hard time,"

13:44.800 --> 13:46.885
and then, like, walked into another room.

13:46.969 --> 13:48.304
It's pretty crazy.

13:48.387 --> 13:49.596
All of us first-generation kids,

13:49.680 --> 13:51.182
we have these amazing lives,

13:51.265 --> 13:53.642
and it's all 'cause our parents
made these crazy sacrifices.

13:53.725 --> 13:55.186
And we never thank them.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.146
Like, we do nothing to thank them.

13:57.229 --> 13:59.190
Shouldn't we do something?

13:59.273 --> 14:00.983
Yeah, like a gift or something?

14:01.066 --> 14:02.693
I mean,
what would I get my dad for a gift?

14:02.776 --> 14:04.236
He doesn't really have any interests.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.364
I mean, he likes drinking water,

14:06.446 --> 14:07.656
staying hydrated.

14:07.739 --> 14:11.076
I could get him a gallon of water
as a gift.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.495
Is there such a thing
as a "water of the month" club?

14:13.578 --> 14:15.956
Hey, what if we took them out
to a nice dinner

14:16.040 --> 14:17.791
and learned more about their lives

14:17.875 --> 14:19.543
and just said thank you?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.295
Yeah. I mean, sure.

14:21.379 --> 14:22.754
I bet my dad will be in.

14:22.838 --> 14:25.257
'Cause you know what he's gonna be able
to drink with his dinner?

14:25.341 --> 14:26.591
Water.

14:28.302 --> 14:29.136
Hello?

14:29.220 --> 14:30.512
Hey, Dev.

14:30.595 --> 14:33.682
The director is not going to be able
to fly in tomorrow.

14:33.765 --> 14:35.434
He really liked your read, though,

14:35.517 --> 14:38.812
and wanted to know if you could read now
via Skype.

14:38.896 --> 14:40.022
Oh, um,

14:40.105 --> 14:42.900
well, the Wi-Fi in my apartment
is really shoddy.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.235
Is there any way we could do it
in a couple hours?

14:44.318 --> 14:46.445
I can maybe go to a friend's place
or something.

14:46.528 --> 14:47.863
Ooh, their time is pretty tight.

14:47.946 --> 14:49.948
Can you find someplace else to go quickly?

14:50.032 --> 14:51.867
Uh, yeah.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.118
Let me grab my computer,

14:53.202 --> 14:54.203
and I'll figure something out.

14:54.286 --> 14:55.620
I'll call you back in, like, 15 minutes,
all right?

14:55.704 --> 14:56.830
Thanks.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.754
Hey, can you guys hear me okay?

15:03.837 --> 15:05.339
Yes, we can, Dev.

15:05.423 --> 15:07.132
You're gonna read scene 22,

15:07.216 --> 15:08.300
part of Dr. Vincent.

15:08.384 --> 15:11.470
Uh, yeah, okay.

15:11.553 --> 15:12.846
If my calculations are correct,

15:12.930 --> 15:15.307
the sickening could infect
one billion people

15:15.391 --> 15:16.641
in the next 12 hours.

15:16.725 --> 15:17.768
My God.

15:17.851 --> 15:18.685
Wait.

15:18.769 --> 15:20.604
One of the samples-- It's missing.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.147
Oh, God. The vial.

15:22.231 --> 15:23.482
It's been compromised.

15:23.565 --> 15:26.402
Dr. Vincent, the pathogen, it's airborne.

15:26.485 --> 15:29.321
The sickening! It's happening!

15:29.405 --> 15:31.449
Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there,

15:31.531 --> 15:34.076
'cause this is where the sickening
first takes hold,

15:34.159 --> 15:35.119
so I need you to play that up.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.120
Are you sitting down?

15:36.203 --> 15:37.496
Why don't you get up out of your chair?

15:37.579 --> 15:39.498
Act like it's all taking over your body.

15:39.581 --> 15:41.541
The sickening!

15:41.625 --> 15:42.918
It's happening!

15:43.001 --> 15:45.129
The virus, it's eating my flesh!

15:45.212 --> 15:46.505
My eyes are on fire!

15:49.133 --> 15:51.302
What is happening in the lab?

15:51.385 --> 15:52.928
The room, it's contaminated!

15:53.011 --> 15:54.679
The virus is gonna kill us all!

15:54.763 --> 15:56.765
Everyone get the fuck out of here now!

15:56.848 --> 15:57.975
Get out now!

15:58.058 --> 15:59.518
Wait! Wait! It's too late!

15:59.601 --> 16:01.019
Lock the fucking doors!

16:01.103 --> 16:02.271
Stay in here!

16:02.354 --> 16:04.731
We got to sacrifice ourselves
in order to stop the virus from spreading!

16:04.815 --> 16:06.775
-No!
-Sir.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.860
You can't do whatever it is
you're doing here.

16:08.944 --> 16:10.446
You need to leave.

16:10.529 --> 16:11.780
I'm just doing an audition.

16:11.863 --> 16:13.782
Can I just finish the audition?
It's almost done.

16:13.865 --> 16:14.950
Yeah-- It's almost done.

16:15.033 --> 16:16.535
-All right? Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

16:16.618 --> 16:18.703
Sorry, guys.
I'll just pick it up from there.

16:18.787 --> 16:20.080
Holy fucking shit!

16:20.164 --> 16:22.166
No!

16:23.875 --> 16:25.169
And I'm done.

16:26.837 --> 16:27.838
Thank you.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.798
All right, thanks, Dev. That was great.

16:29.881 --> 16:30.882
We'll be in touch.

16:33.969 --> 16:36.096
Why the fuck is he in a coffee shop?

16:36.180 --> 16:38.598
Jesus Christ, is he homeless?

16:38.682 --> 16:41.560
Um, the video feed's still live.

16:41.643 --> 16:42.936
Oh, shit. Sorry.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.021
All good.

16:45.689 --> 16:48.150
Guys, thank you so much for coming.

16:48.233 --> 16:50.694
Brian and I just wanted to take you
to a nice dinner

16:50.777 --> 16:51.903
to say thank you.

16:51.987 --> 16:53.238
You worked very hard.

16:53.322 --> 16:54.448
You came to this country.

16:54.532 --> 16:55.574
You gave us a better life,

16:55.657 --> 16:58.118
and we've never really shown
our appreciation.

16:58.202 --> 17:00.538
So, uh... to our parents.

17:02.747 --> 17:04.291
Excuse me, sir.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.418
Can we order the chicken
with broccoli, please?

17:06.502 --> 17:08.837
Sorry this man is ordering
chicken with broccoli.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.466
Please bring the good dishes
you only serve to Chinese people.

17:12.550 --> 17:13.425
Of course.

17:13.509 --> 17:16.428
I can't believe they think
that's what we eat in Taiwan.

17:16.512 --> 17:17.929
Can you imagine?

17:19.806 --> 17:23.227
What is this super special
spicy Szechuan chicken?

17:23.310 --> 17:25.062
Ramesh, why are you looking at that?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.605
You don't even eat spicy food.

17:26.688 --> 17:29.900
It is super special. Must be good.

17:35.239 --> 17:38.617
Dev, did you bring those photos
from our New Zealand trip?

17:38.700 --> 17:40.827
Uh-oh. I forget them. Sorry.

17:40.911 --> 17:43.830
You know, he takes a lot of photos
with his camera,

17:43.914 --> 17:45.749
and we never get to see them.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.085
I took a bunch of photos with my iPad.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.338
No. You just took one long video.

17:51.422 --> 17:54.425
Hey, that is the whole trip, man.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.967
You see everything.

17:56.051 --> 17:58.262
Ma, why are you just eating white rice?

17:58.345 --> 18:00.097
I like to eat whatever I want to eat.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.723
Do I tell you what to eat?

18:01.806 --> 18:03.267
I don't even like Chinese food.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.643
Well, why didn't you say something?

18:04.726 --> 18:06.395
We didn't have to come here.
We could have gone somewhere else.

18:06.478 --> 18:07.854
I like this place.

18:07.938 --> 18:10.274
I took Mom once.
She didn't eat anything, though.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.234
Yeah,
because she doesn't like Chinese food.

18:12.317 --> 18:14.361
I like it. It's great.

18:14.445 --> 18:16.738
Another reason that we wanted
to take you guys out

18:16.821 --> 18:19.908
was to learn more about you
and how you got here.

18:19.991 --> 18:22.994
Dad, do you have any stories
you care to share?

18:23.078 --> 18:26.457
I cannot think of anything noteworthy.

18:27.625 --> 18:28.917
Uh, come on.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.043
There's got to be something, right?

18:30.127 --> 18:34.172
Like-- Well, what did you do
when you were growing up in Taiwan?

18:34.256 --> 18:36.634
I worked very hard.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.093
Okay.

18:38.176 --> 18:40.304
Did anything
particularly interesting happen?

18:44.558 --> 18:45.476
No.

18:47.478 --> 18:48.604
Well, what about you guys?

18:48.687 --> 18:50.648
What did you do when you were our age
here in New York?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.400
I just worked and took care of you
and your father.

18:53.484 --> 18:55.152
What about for fun?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.612
Po-da. We didn't do anything for fun.

18:56.695 --> 19:00.031
You realize fun is a new thing, right?

19:00.115 --> 19:03.160
Fun is a luxury
only your generation really has.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.036
What about when you were a kid?
What did you do for fun then?

19:06.455 --> 19:08.373
Whee!

19:10.334 --> 19:13.629
Daddy! Look at this guitar! Can we buy it?

19:13.712 --> 19:15.297
That's nonsense.

19:15.380 --> 19:19.801
Do you want a beating?
We don't have time for that.

19:24.306 --> 19:25.307
Hey, man, look.

19:25.390 --> 19:26.600
I got you a guitar.

19:27.976 --> 19:30.437
Dad, I'm playing my game.

19:32.063 --> 19:33.815
Whoa.

19:33.898 --> 19:35.567
You had all the toys.

19:35.651 --> 19:38.278
We used to take you to soccer team,

19:38.362 --> 19:39.946
guitar lesson, Nintendo.

19:40.030 --> 19:42.741
I simply studied, played outside,

19:42.824 --> 19:44.951
ate some rice, and went to bed.

19:45.035 --> 19:47.162
Ma, what about your first day in America?

19:47.245 --> 19:48.747
That must have been pretty exciting.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.915
No, I just got dropped off
from the airport,

19:50.999 --> 19:52.834
and your father went to work.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.962
I didn't know nobody,
and I barely knew your father.

19:56.046 --> 19:58.173
We had an arranged marriage.

19:58.256 --> 20:01.051
And I knew him only for a week or so.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.135
What about that first day, though?

20:02.219 --> 20:03.554
Did you go out and explore the city?

20:03.637 --> 20:06.181
No, I sat on the couch and cried.

20:06.264 --> 20:07.349
Well, that's really sad.

20:08.350 --> 20:09.643
You asked!

20:09.727 --> 20:11.395
Well, is there anything else you remember?

20:11.478 --> 20:14.272
Yeah, I was scared to answer the telephone

20:14.356 --> 20:18.068
because nobody would understand me
because of my accent.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.862
I was scared of answering the phone, too.

20:20.945 --> 20:22.698
They yell so much.

20:22.781 --> 20:24.491
"What?" "Huh?"

20:24.575 --> 20:26.451
I just got to this country.

20:26.535 --> 20:28.579
Why are they so mad?

20:28.662 --> 20:30.789
That's messed up. Your English is good.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.291
Are there any other stories
that you remember

20:33.375 --> 20:36.211
from when you first got here
or from your childhood?

20:46.054 --> 20:48.014
You ate your pet chicken?

20:48.098 --> 20:50.434
Yes.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.936
Hey, do you have any more pet chicken
you can kill?

20:53.019 --> 20:55.105
I've been waiting here for 45 minutes.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.691
Where is my chicken with broccoli, man?

21:00.068 --> 21:02.028
Once, when Brian was younger,

21:02.112 --> 21:03.530
we were at a restaurant,

21:03.614 --> 21:06.032
and they brought a plate of desserts
for us to look at.

21:06.116 --> 21:07.534
Brian grabbed a piece of chocolate cake

21:07.618 --> 21:09.911
and put it all over his face.

21:09.994 --> 21:12.539
To be clear, I was seven, so...

21:12.623 --> 21:13.791
"Oh, yum!"

21:14.916 --> 21:17.753
-I took Dev one time to Pizza Hut.
-Uh-huh.

21:17.836 --> 21:19.463
This girl bullying him.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.256
She pushed him into the ball pit.

21:21.339 --> 21:24.718
He said, "Daddy! Wendy pushing me!"

21:24.802 --> 21:28.012
Hey, that girl got held back a grade.
She was huge.

21:32.142 --> 21:33.602
This is fun.

21:33.685 --> 21:35.228
I am having fun.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.024
That was great the other night, man.

21:40.108 --> 21:41.401
I never heard any of that shit.

21:41.485 --> 21:43.654
Like, what an insane journey.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.405
My dad used to bathe in a river,

21:45.489 --> 21:47.741
and now he drives a car that talks to him.

21:47.825 --> 21:49.868
So crazy to think
that every immigrant's story

21:49.951 --> 21:51.161
is probably that insane.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.078
I'm just glad we did it.

21:52.162 --> 21:53.413
Like, I can't believe there's a universe

21:53.497 --> 21:56.416
where I wouldn't know that my dad
had a water buffalo named Ting Ting.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.794
Yeah, or that my mom
had a friend named Kunjilikaka.

21:58.877 --> 21:59.711
What a great name.

22:02.339 --> 22:03.173
Oh, damn.

22:03.256 --> 22:04.424
Are you on this text chain
with all the parents?

22:04.508 --> 22:06.259
Is my dad on there?

22:06.343 --> 22:07.177
I guess so.

22:07.260 --> 22:09.596
They must have exchanged numbers
after that dinner.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.014
Why am I not on there?

22:11.097 --> 22:12.474
Looks like there's another Brian on here.

22:12.557 --> 22:13.475
Brian Donkers.

22:13.558 --> 22:14.852
Someone must have screwed up.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.812
They all want to have dinner again
tonight.

22:16.895 --> 22:20.023
My dad: "Let's chow down at Mr. Chow's."

22:20.106 --> 22:23.652
Your dad: "This sounds fun.
I would attend this event."

22:23.735 --> 22:25.696
Wait. What? What is going on right now?

22:25.779 --> 22:26.822
We can't have dinner with them again.

22:26.905 --> 22:28.323
I'm not trying to hang out
with Peter Chang on the regs.

22:28.406 --> 22:29.658
No, I just wanted to do one dinner.

22:29.741 --> 22:32.035
I don't want, like,
a serious relationship with my father.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.953
-Tell them we can't go.
-All right.

22:34.037 --> 22:37.957
"Sorry, Brian and I already have plans."

22:39.292 --> 22:41.294
Peter Chang: "Dev, don't worry.

22:41.378 --> 22:43.296
Wendy the bully won't be there. Ha ha."

22:43.380 --> 22:46.257
Oh, damn.
Peter Chang coming hard with the snaps.

22:47.551 --> 22:50.637
Brian Donkers: "I'm in!"

22:58.436 --> 23:01.899
I am so sorry
about that weird Skype audition.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.942
If there's any way I can read again,
I know I can do better.

23:04.025 --> 23:06.486
I agree,
which is why I brought you in today

23:06.570 --> 23:08.029
for a session with the studio.

23:08.112 --> 23:09.364
Great.

23:09.447 --> 23:10.365
But here's the thing:

23:10.448 --> 23:13.117
we just went with another actor
to play Dr. Vincent.

23:13.201 --> 23:14.202
Huh?

23:14.285 --> 23:17.706
His agent called literally ten minutes ago

23:17.789 --> 23:18.832
to close his deal,

23:18.916 --> 23:22.794
and, you know,
rather than having you audition

23:22.878 --> 23:24.254
and waste everybody's time,

23:24.337 --> 23:25.964
I just figured I would tell you the truth.

23:26.047 --> 23:29.092
But now I'm starting to regret
that decision.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.136
Well, whatever. It's fine.
I wasn't doing anything anyway.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.639
Guess I'll just head out.

23:34.723 --> 23:36.015
Grab a water.

23:36.099 --> 23:39.477
Uh, that's really more for people
to have a drink while they're waiting.

23:39.561 --> 23:42.105
It's not really a to-go situation.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.815
Are you fucking serious?

23:43.899 --> 23:47.026
It's not for people
to just take it and go.

23:47.110 --> 23:49.613
This isn't New Orleans.

24:00.582 --> 24:01.666
Hello.

24:01.750 --> 24:02.960
Hey, Dad.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.002
What's going on?

24:04.085 --> 24:07.631
I just took Dr. Ramusami
to the train station.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.841
What's up with you, man?

24:09.925 --> 24:11.134
Nothing much.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.386
Is everything okay?

24:13.470 --> 24:15.346
I just met with those movie people,

24:15.430 --> 24:18.016
and I'm not gonna get that part.

24:18.099 --> 24:19.559
It's okay.

24:19.643 --> 24:22.687
Me and Mom were watching
your Go-Gurt commercial.

24:22.771 --> 24:24.731
You did a good job, man.

24:24.815 --> 24:26.608
Did you show the YouTube to them?

24:26.691 --> 24:29.820
No, you don't usually show YouTube clips
at auditions.

24:29.903 --> 24:31.571
But thank you.

24:31.655 --> 24:32.864
Well, it's okay.

24:32.948 --> 24:34.741
You will get into the next one.

24:35.826 --> 24:37.160
All right, talk to you later.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.787
Bye-bye.

24:38.870 --> 24:39.746
Bye.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.256
Eyes are closed, right?

24:50.340 --> 24:51.591
-Yep.
-Yep.

24:54.719 --> 24:56.429
All right, open them.

24:56.513 --> 24:57.555
Surprise!

24:57.639 --> 24:58.473
Ooh.

24:58.556 --> 25:01.059
-Got you a gift.
-Very nice.

25:01.142 --> 25:03.812
Yeah, you said Thatha wouldn't
get you a guitar, so I got you one.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.730
And I got you a month of lessons too.

25:05.814 --> 25:07.357
Thank you, Dev.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.567
You get a hug for that.

25:09.651 --> 25:11.319
Thank you.

25:11.402 --> 25:13.154
No gift for me?

25:13.237 --> 25:15.198
Yup, I got you something, too.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.783
Photo.

25:16.867 --> 25:18.451
Oh, that's beautiful.

25:18.535 --> 25:19.870
Thank you so much.

25:19.953 --> 25:21.079
I love you.

25:21.162 --> 25:22.539
I love you, too.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.958
All right, where should we go eat?

25:25.042 --> 25:26.960
Mr. Chow's.

25:27.044 --> 25:29.046
Ramesh, get out of here.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.964
You know I don't like Chinese food.

25:31.048 --> 25:32.632
You want to just cook some food at home?

25:32.716 --> 25:34.384
Yeah, let me make some korma.

25:34.467 --> 25:35.468
You sure you don't want to go
for a nice dinner?

25:35.552 --> 25:39.723
No, you don't need to take us out
for any fancy dinner.

25:39.806 --> 25:40.891
Just call us once a week.

25:40.974 --> 25:42.726
That would be good.
