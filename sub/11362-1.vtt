23:07.511 --> 23:08.511
- What are you doing here?

23:08.637 --> 23:11.514
- l-l was wondering
if we could talk.

- l called twice.

23:15.018 --> 23:16.811

l'm sorry.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.022
Why don't you-
you go on ahead.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.190
- Are you sure, Sue?

23:21.316 --> 23:23.317
- Yeah, no, good, go.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.403
Good.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.113

for a second?

23:31.743 --> 23:33.327
- Yeah.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.748
- This is completely
inappropriate.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.125
This is like a violation.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.709
- l wasn't trying to violate-

23:40.836 --> 23:42.711
- Well, you did.
You are.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.713
You are violating
my personal space.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.799
You are violating
my personal life.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.259
l can't do this.
l have to be somewhere.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.343
l'm late.

23:49.469 --> 23:50.970
- lt's-it's 5:00.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.096
What could you be
late for?

23:52.222 --> 23:53.347
- l have an event.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.182
- You have an event?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.350
What kind of an event?

23:56.476 --> 23:58.477
- l'm not gonna tell you.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.896
- Can l come?

24:38.768 --> 24:40.144
Here.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.355
Come on, you need it.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.608
You do this every week?

24:45.734 --> 24:46.859
- Yeah.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.611
- You're really good.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.909
- You can't stay, Mike.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.202
- Why not?

24:56.328 --> 24:58.829
- 'Cause it's insane.

24:58.955 --> 24:59.914
l let you touch my butt,

25:00.040 --> 25:02.708
and then you fly all the way
across the country.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.544
- Well, it was much more
than a butt touch.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.050
- Still, you can't stay.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.594
l got a lot l got to do.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.346
- Well, how much stuff
can you do in one night?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.139
- A lot.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.600
- Like what?

25:19.726 --> 25:21.393
Do you go out with friends?

25:24.105 --> 25:26.607
- Do you see that girl
over there?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.359
She works
for Burger King.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.569
She gives me vouchers
every week.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.571
And l pass them out.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.240
That's what l do.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.749
- Hey.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.460
l just want
to let you know,

25:46.586 --> 25:49.004
if you want me
to leave tomorrow, l will.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.257
l promise.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.093
- Hey, guys.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.929
- Sue's here.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.013
- Okay.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.348
Whopper.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.308
- Yeah, sure, yeah.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.601
- Whopper.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.144
Whopper.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.814
Whopper, Whopper.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.941
Okay, chicken tenders.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.734
Chicken tender.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.822
Be careful,
easy, easy, easy, easy.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.574
There you go, chicken tender.

26:16.700 --> 26:21.662
Okay, BB-BK veggie burger.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.998
- Fuck that, Sue.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.083
- Come on, it's supposed
to be delicious.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.167
- l don't think so.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.377
- Come on, guys,
it's got soy in it.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.921
lt's really-
it's really good.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.132
- Fine, l'll take one.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.341
- All right.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.467
Hey, who wants a Powerade?

26:35.594 --> 26:36.552
- l do
- l do.

26:36.678 --> 26:37.678
- All right.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.972
Got one there, buddy?

26:42.851 --> 26:43.851
Oh, this is nice.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.894
- Thanks, l've been here
two years.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.028
Compact fluorescents.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.946
- Oh, bummer.

26:56.072 --> 27:00.534
- No, that's-

27:00.660 --> 27:02.870
So l think l'm gonna
go to sleep.

27:02.996 --> 27:05.748
- Do you want me
to touch your butt first?

27:07.792 --> 27:11.670
- No, l only do that
when l'm traveling.

27:12.922 --> 27:16.967
- Right.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.220
So do you-are you alone
here in Maryland,

27:20.347 --> 27:22.097
or do you have relatives around?

27:22.223 --> 27:24.600
- My mom is over in Laurel.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.726
That-

27:25.852 --> 27:27.061
Her name's Mary.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.605
- Oh, what does she do?

27:29.731 --> 27:32.483
- She sells insurance
to deaf people.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.778
- Oh, nice sweat suit.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.490
- [chuckles]

27:39.616 --> 27:42.785
l don't-you know, l don't want
you to take this the wrong way,

27:42.911 --> 27:47.122
but l think we probably
shouldn't sleep in the same bed.

27:47.248 --> 27:48.248
- That's a good call.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.952
- So is your return ticket
all set?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.205
- l actually don't have one.

29:10.331 --> 29:12.791
- You don't have
a return ticket?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.209
- No, l bought a one-way.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.086
- Why?
- Um...

29:16.212 --> 29:17.796
- That's completely
unacceptable, Mike.

29:17.922 --> 29:18.881
- l know.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.007
- You need to buy one.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.425
- l know.
l'm sorry.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.469
l-l didn't have
enough money.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.678
- What?

29:24.804 --> 29:27.139
- l only had enough
for a one-way,

29:27.265 --> 29:31.393
and l thought-l thought,
"l'm just gonna go for it."

29:31.519 --> 29:34.480
- With me?
- Yes.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.898
lt was
a far-flung notion.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.025
- lt was a fucking
stupid notion.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.276
- l guess.

29:39.402 --> 29:41.153
- l'll lend you the money.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.155
- No, you don't have to do that.
- Well, l'm going to.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.074
- Okay, hey,
would you first consider

29:46.201 --> 29:47.910
taking the morning off
from work?

29:48.036 --> 29:49.161
- No.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.205
- We could hang out,
and then l'll leave.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.791
lf l don't, you can mace me.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.417
- You're insane.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.543
- We could go to the zoo.

29:56.669 --> 29:57.628
That'd be fun.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.130
- Mike, zoos suck.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.090
- Okay, then we'll
do something else.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.926
Come on, Sue,
take the day off from work.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.469
You look like you could use it.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.807
- l do?

30:09.933 --> 30:11.725
- No, hey!

30:18.107 --> 30:20.317
[voices overlapping]

30:20.443 --> 30:22.486
- Bump something!

30:22.612 --> 30:23.987
Bump those people.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.447
Wait, wait, wait.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.782
Give it to me.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.784
- Not too hard, okay?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.828
All right.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.037
Oh, man.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.919
- You shouldn't smoke.

30:39.045 --> 30:40.712
- l'm done forever.
l'm serious.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.131
- No, you don't-
hey, you don't have to-

30:43.258 --> 30:44.216
You didn't have to do that.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.300
- l know, but l am.

30:45.426 --> 30:47.219
l'm done.

30:47.345 --> 30:50.138
lt's time.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.266
- Let me see
if l understand something.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.852
Do you think that you, like,
like me, Mike?

30:54.978 --> 30:56.562
- Yes.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.564
- Why?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.941
- 'Cause you have style.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.276
- No, l don't.
- Yeah, you do.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.777
- No, no, l don't.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.404
- Yeah.

31:05.530 --> 31:09.658
You-you give away 30%
of your income.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.619
- You would too
if you made more.

31:12.745 --> 31:14.955
- No, l wouldn't.

31:15.081 --> 31:20.794
You're also
incredibly sweet.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.505
Well, beneath, you know.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.844
- Beneath what?

31:28.970 --> 31:32.139
- Beneath the part of you
that's not.

31:36.060 --> 31:39.146
- You better catch your bus.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.029
- l'll pay you back
for the ticket.

31:47.155 --> 31:51.575
- Don't worry about it.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.786
- So will l ever
see you again?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.496
- l wouldn't be
good for you, Mike.

31:56.623 --> 31:57.581
l'm not good with people.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.790
- No, that's not true.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.167
- Yeah, no, it is.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.960
- No, it's not.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.629
What about
those homeless guys?

32:03.755 --> 32:06.548
They love you.

32:06.674 --> 32:12.054
What about the soccer gals?

32:12.180 --> 32:14.723
What about me?

32:31.908 --> 32:33.200
- Okay, buddy,
all aboard.

32:36.454 --> 32:39.831
- l think, Mike,
you'd better get on the bus.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.464
- Hey, Sue,
it's Mike calling again.

33:29.590 --> 33:30.632
l'm trying not to call too much,

33:30.758 --> 33:33.301
but l just want to make sure
that you got the poem

33:33.428 --> 33:34.553
that l sent last week,

33:34.679 --> 33:38.015
you know, the sort of elongated
haiku thing.

33:38.141 --> 33:42.227
Anyway, you know my home number
and of course the front desk.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.478
But seriously, you should call,

33:43.604 --> 33:45.856
because l'm-
l'm definitely around.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.774
Anyway, talk to you later,
l hope.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.234

quit smoking.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.083
- l just did.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.089
What are you doing here?

34:53.466 --> 34:54.507
- Work.

34:57.136 --> 34:59.679
- Hey, did-did you get
my haiku?

34:59.806 --> 35:02.099
- The elongated one?

35:02.225 --> 35:08.105
- Yeah.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.481
lt was nice.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.528
- So you're just
passing through?

35:14.654 --> 35:16.029
- Yeah.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.198
l fly out
from Phoenix tomorrow.

35:18.324 --> 35:19.574
- Oh, okay.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.077
- l'll take that.
- Oh, thank you.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.996
- So this must be a really,
you know,

35:25.123 --> 35:27.624
good region
for corporate art sales.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.335
- Yes, it is.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.461
- Good.

35:34.549 --> 35:39.803
Hey, l'm supposed to go to this
yoga class thing later.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.430
Would you like
to come with me?

36:05.079 --> 36:06.329
Do you have
a boyfriend, Sue?

36:06.455 --> 36:07.914
- No.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.000
- Did you recently?

36:11.502 --> 36:12.460
- Yes.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.462
- What was his name?

36:14.589 --> 36:17.883
- Jango.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.092
He's an ex-punk.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.011
- Ex-like, an ex-punk?

36:21.137 --> 36:23.680
- Ex-rock punk.

36:23.806 --> 36:26.141
We broke up
when he moved away.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.393
- Why'd he leave?

36:28.519 --> 36:30.437
- To open
the Pacific Northwest branch

36:30.563 --> 36:33.398
of his organic
yogurt company.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.482
He's the president.

36:34.609 --> 36:35.609
- There you go.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.320
- Thank you.

36:38.446 --> 36:40.530
- Thanks.

36:40.656 --> 36:42.699
So how's yourjob
these days?

36:42.825 --> 36:43.992
- lt's okay.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.494
- But it's not
your fantasyjob.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.747
- l don't really
do fantasy, Mike.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.624
- lf you could close your eyes
and pick anything,

36:50.750 --> 36:51.750
what would it be?

36:52.960 --> 36:53.960
- Uh...

36:54.086 --> 36:55.128
- But you got to close
your eyes.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.254
Otherwise,
it's not gonna work.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.589
- Oh, okay.

36:57.715 --> 37:02.052
Okay.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.013
To run a full-service,
state-of-the-art soup kitchen.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.223
- Wow.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.892
- Multiple housing
units upstairs,

37:09.018 --> 37:12.354
recreational facilities
in the basement,

37:12.480 --> 37:14.898
job outreach,
midnight basketball.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.650
- Really good soup?
- Always.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.569
Excellent soup,
first and foremost.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.030
- What about kids?

37:22.156 --> 37:23.281
You want to have kids?

37:25.034 --> 37:26.117
- You know what
was really great

37:26.244 --> 37:29.454
about that yoga class?

37:29.580 --> 37:33.500
lt was the breathing stuff.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.043
l don't do that.

37:35.169 --> 37:36.253
- Breathe?

37:36.379 --> 37:40.507
- There are days where
l have to instruct my heart

37:40.633 --> 37:45.637
to request additional air.

37:45.763 --> 37:49.266
And l have to tell myself,

37:49.392 --> 37:50.850
"Breathe, Sue.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.853
Just keep breathing."

37:56.107 --> 37:58.024
Yes, l want kids.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.402
- Were you not sure
when l asked?

38:03.447 --> 38:06.700
- l just don't think
l've ever really been asked...

38:06.826 --> 38:09.369
that way...

38:09.495 --> 38:11.705
before.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.374
- Can l ask
one more question?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.418
And then l'm done,
l swear.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.711
- What?

38:20.214 --> 38:22.507
- Will you come visit my mom
with me on the way home?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.843
She's sick, and l-

38:24.969 --> 38:28.388
l promised l'd stop by.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.807
- Here, these are for you.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.476
There's a flower
show downtown.

38:33.602 --> 38:37.772
- That's nice of you.

38:37.898 --> 38:42.319
- Um, hey, Ma, Sue flew in from
Baltimore just this morning.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.154
- What do you do, Sue?

38:44.280 --> 38:48.616
- l sell corporate
decorative art.

38:48.743 --> 38:49.951
- l've met you before.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.287
- Yeah, you know,
she stayed at the motel, Ma.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.371
That's how we met.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.123
- And where are you
from originally?

38:55.249 --> 38:57.792
- l'm from Columbia, Maryland.

38:57.918 --> 38:59.753
- Do you come
from a good family?

38:59.879 --> 39:02.339
- Uh...

39:02.465 --> 39:04.007
No, not really.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.760
- ls there something
specifically wrong

39:06.886 --> 39:09.095
with your family?

39:09.221 --> 39:11.264
- Well, my father lives
on an ashram

39:11.390 --> 39:13.475
in Northern California.

39:13.601 --> 39:18.938
Pretty much sums up
everything about him.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.899
He once forgot to pick me up
from gymnastics

39:21.025 --> 39:22.817
for an entire night.

39:22.943 --> 39:24.319
- That's quite a lot
of somersaults.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.197
- [laughs]

39:27.323 --> 39:28.698
- l didn't care.

39:28.824 --> 39:31.117
lt reallyjust explains
more about him

39:31.243 --> 39:34.579
than it does me.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.082
- [coughs]

39:37.208 --> 39:39.793
Could you hand me
those pills, Mike?

39:39.919 --> 39:40.877
- Which ones?

39:41.003 --> 39:44.255
- The ones on the left there.

39:50.971 --> 39:53.640
Can l talk to my son in private
for a moment?

39:55.017 --> 39:56.684
- Yeah, l-
Did l say something wrong?

39:56.811 --> 39:58.561
- Not at all.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.022
- l'll just be a moment.

40:03.317 --> 40:04.484
- Okay.

40:11.826 --> 40:12.867
- l like her.

40:12.993 --> 40:15.161
- Really?

40:15.287 --> 40:19.040
- She's a bit
of a long shot.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.458
But she's logical

40:20.584 --> 40:24.254
in an emotionally annihilated
kind of way.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.339
But that's okay.

40:26.465 --> 40:29.551
Underneath,
there's a heart of-

40:29.677 --> 40:30.677
- Gold?

40:30.803 --> 40:32.053
- No, l wouldn't say gold.

40:32.179 --> 40:34.097
Maybe made of...

40:34.223 --> 40:35.682
leather.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.770
But if it works out,

40:40.896 --> 40:42.397
she'll be good for you
when l'm gone.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.899
Needless to say,
what would make me happy

40:45.025 --> 40:48.403
is for you to find something
for yourself

40:48.529 --> 40:49.821
before my checkout time,

40:49.947 --> 40:52.449
just so l know it's not

40:52.575 --> 40:56.619
you and your father alone here,
walking around like robots.

40:56.745 --> 40:58.663
- Ma, Dad's not a robot.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.165
- He is.

41:00.291 --> 41:05.587
But l was mostly talking
about you...

41:05.713 --> 41:08.214
unless you find
a way out.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.299
- Of what?

41:09.425 --> 41:12.135
- Of whatever it is
you're stuck in.

41:15.806 --> 41:18.683
You get it from your father.

41:18.809 --> 41:22.395
He came back
from the war stuck.

41:22.521 --> 41:25.356
Been talking about
joining a gym ever since.

41:27.401 --> 41:29.277
Never has.

41:29.403 --> 41:34.616
But that doesn't
have to be you.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.084
- You okay?

41:45.211 --> 41:47.337
- Yeah, are you?

41:47.463 --> 41:50.632
- Yeah.

41:50.758 --> 41:52.634
- She liked you.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.760
- No, she didn't.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.553
- Yeah, she did.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.223
She told me.

42:12.154 --> 42:14.280
- What took you so long?

42:17.618 --> 42:20.203
- Dad, do you remember Sue?

42:21.622 --> 42:23.414
- Hi.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.542
There's a toilet overflowing
in 1 1 0.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.794
- Okay.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.088
- Got to get home to your mom.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.668
- You really leaving?

43:08.794 --> 43:10.295
- l have to.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.880
- You can't do one more night?

43:13.007 --> 43:15.174
- l have meetings
this afternoon in Seattle.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.844
- Blow 'em off
and just stay for a while.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.262
- lt's myjob.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.388
- l know.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.599
But, you know, you could get
a job around here.

43:22.725 --> 43:24.559
- Where, Szechuan House?

43:24.685 --> 43:27.228
- No.

43:27.354 --> 43:28.438
l'm just saying that,
you know-

43:28.564 --> 43:32.525
- Mike.

43:32.651 --> 43:37.488
l don't know
how to say this.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.575
This isn't gonna work.

43:40.701 --> 43:44.203
l mean, l'll-l'll stop by
when l pass through.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.705
- Come on,
what do you mean?

43:48.125 --> 43:50.668
- l can't move from Baltimore

43:50.794 --> 43:52.420
to live in
a corner double room

43:52.546 --> 43:54.672
of your parents' motel.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.679
l mean...

44:01.805 --> 44:03.806
be serious.

44:07.311 --> 44:10.271
l'm sorry.

44:10.397 --> 44:13.024
l'll stay in better touch
this time.

44:13.150 --> 44:16.027
- Yeah, whatever you say.

44:50.896 --> 44:53.690
So this is where she wanted?

44:53.816 --> 44:58.236
- Well, this used to be
all scrub.

44:58.362 --> 44:59.487
She'd be cringing right now

44:59.613 --> 45:02.448
if she knew
they were building here.

45:02.574 --> 45:07.453
But l promised her
l'd do it.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.795
- Yeah, it's still nice.

45:18.257 --> 45:20.967
- l meant to give this
to you earlier.

45:21.093 --> 45:24.011
lt's your mom's favorite
piece ofjewelry.

45:24.138 --> 45:25.722
As you know,
she was a necklace woman.

45:25.848 --> 45:28.433
She thought
you should have it.

45:28.559 --> 45:29.684
Don't know why.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.061
Wouldn't want you
to start wearing it,

45:32.187 --> 45:36.649
but maybe you can find
some use for it, something.

45:36.775 --> 45:37.775
- Thanks, Dad.

45:37.901 --> 45:41.487
- Also had some guy call me,

45:41.613 --> 45:43.030
wanted to buy the motel.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.451
- You gonna do it?

45:46.577 --> 45:47.535
- l doubt it.

45:47.661 --> 45:50.621
May as well keep
running it.

45:50.748 --> 45:51.956
But you can do
what you want, Mike,

45:52.082 --> 45:53.166
you know, if you-

45:53.292 --> 45:56.169
you want to leave.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.341
- This ain't a half bad
hunk ofjunk.

47:25.467 --> 47:26.592
- Yeah, it was my mother's.

47:26.718 --> 47:29.637
- Oh, God, let's not go down
the sentimental road.

47:29.763 --> 47:30.930
- Oh, l'm not.
l'm just saying.

47:31.056 --> 47:32.223
- Yeah, l know
what you're saying,

47:32.349 --> 47:33.683
and l know
you're gonna start crying.

47:33.809 --> 47:34.976
- What?
No, l'm not.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.603
- How long you been
in the pawn business?

47:37.729 --> 47:39.021
- The porn business?

47:39.147 --> 47:40.815
- No, the pawn business,
God damn it.

47:40.941 --> 47:43.109
How long you been
in the pawn business?

47:43.235 --> 47:45.903
- Oh, no, l'm never-
l'm not in that.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.280
- No, no, exactly.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.574
So when somebody says
they ain't gonna start crying,

47:49.700 --> 47:51.826
that's sure as shit sign

47:51.952 --> 47:54.787
that they's just about
to start blubbering like a calf.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.504
Oh, see what l mean?

48:03.630 --> 48:06.841
- Just, how much
for the necklace?

48:10.554 --> 48:11.846
- l'll give you $300.

48:13.807 --> 48:14.807
- Okay.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.398
- Oh.

48:22.524 --> 48:24.525
- Hi.
- Hi.

48:24.651 --> 48:26.152
- l'm here to see Sue, please.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.195
- Sue no longer works here.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.947
- l'm sorry?

48:30.073 --> 48:32.158
- She moved to Washington.

48:32.284 --> 48:33.784
- D.C.?

48:33.911 --> 48:35.620
- State.

48:36.997 --> 48:39.040
Her old boyfriend convinced her
to move out to Aberdeen,

48:39.166 --> 48:40.917
showed up here with flowers,
first class plane tickets.

48:41.043 --> 48:43.461
lt was very
Officer and a Gentleman.

48:57.017 --> 48:58.893
- [screams]

48:59.019 --> 49:00.061
Fuck!

49:39.226 --> 49:42.228
- [speaking foreign language]

49:46.066 --> 49:47.066
- Number eight?

49:47.192 --> 49:48.609
- [speaking foreign language]

49:48.735 --> 49:49.777
- Eight?

49:49.903 --> 49:52.905
- [speaking foreign language]

49:54.408 --> 49:57.284
Dude, l'm just messing with you.

49:57.411 --> 49:58.411
You're new in town, right?

49:58.537 --> 50:00.746
- Oh, yeah.

50:02.749 --> 50:04.417
- You looking for a job?

50:05.794 --> 50:08.129
- Yeah.

50:08.255 --> 50:12.133
- You, uh...

50:12.259 --> 50:14.176
you want to work here?

50:15.345 --> 50:16.303
- Seriously?

50:16.430 --> 50:18.305
- Why the fuck
wouldn't l be serious?

50:20.392 --> 50:22.268
- Al.
- l'm Mike.

50:22.394 --> 50:23.477
- Mike, it is nice
to meet you, Mike.

50:23.603 --> 50:24.603
- Yeah, you too.

50:24.730 --> 50:25.813
- Dude, you stink.

50:25.939 --> 50:27.648
- l do?
- Big time.

50:27.774 --> 50:29.358
You can't work here
if you stink.

50:29.484 --> 50:31.277
lt's my parents' place,
and they're old school.

50:31.403 --> 50:32.486
They really hate stinky people.

50:32.612 --> 50:33.863
- Okay.

50:33.989 --> 50:37.033
- Yeah, so, like, go home,
take a shower, please,

50:37.159 --> 50:39.160
come back,
and l will get you the job.

50:40.996 --> 50:43.414
- l don't have a home.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.583
- Really?

50:45.709 --> 50:48.002
- He also needs
a place to live.

50:48.128 --> 50:50.504
So l was thinking
that maybe we could, you know,

50:50.630 --> 50:51.881
let him stay in the basement

50:52.007 --> 50:54.050
and deduct some rent
from his pay.

50:55.302 --> 50:59.889
- [speaking foreign language]

51:01.475 --> 51:03.642
- Great.

51:06.730 --> 51:08.022
- Hey, thanks a lot
for helping me out.

51:08.148 --> 51:10.608
lt really means a lot.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.693
- Dude, no problem, man.

51:12.819 --> 51:14.278
You know, l've been trying
to get my folks

51:14.404 --> 51:15.571
to hire someone American anyway,

51:15.697 --> 51:17.490
'cause we catch less
bigot bullshit that way.

51:17.616 --> 51:19.533
Plus, l freakin' hate
working the mornings.

51:19.659 --> 51:21.160
- Why?

51:21.286 --> 51:23.120
- 'Cause l smoke a lot of pot,
and l like sleeping in.

51:23.246 --> 51:25.122
- That's cool.

51:25.248 --> 51:27.500
- So why'd you come
to Aberdeen, Mike?

51:27.626 --> 51:30.711
- This girl
that l'm in love with,

51:30.837 --> 51:33.297
she moved here
to be with her ex-boyfriend.

51:35.634 --> 51:37.843
- Oh, that sucks, man.

51:37.969 --> 51:41.472
- Yeah, especially considering
the guy's a punk.

51:41.598 --> 51:43.808
- Like, a punk punk?

51:43.934 --> 51:45.059
- Ex-punk.

51:45.185 --> 51:46.268
l think he's older now.

51:49.439 --> 51:50.397
- Does he train dogs?

51:50.524 --> 51:51.649
- l don't know.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.943
- ls his name, like, Jango?

51:54.069 --> 51:57.154
- Jang-yeah, l think it is.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.073
- l have totally
heard of this dude, Mike.

51:59.199 --> 52:01.909
- ls he a punk?
- No, he's an ex-punk.

52:03.578 --> 52:04.787
- So the thing
with this guy is, right?

52:04.913 --> 52:06.831
He's also, like,
a yogurt magnate.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.541
Okay, totally huge
in the yogurt business.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.918
This guy's, like,
a yogurt fucking mogul.

52:11.044 --> 52:13.087
You see those kennels
over there?

52:13.213 --> 52:15.840
That's where he
keeps the dogs.

52:15.966 --> 52:17.758
- Damn it.
- What?

52:17.884 --> 52:18.884
- This guy-

52:19.010 --> 52:20.761
this guy is, like,
a total stud.

52:20.887 --> 52:21.887
- What do you mean?

52:22.013 --> 52:25.141
- l'm not a sexual superman.

52:25.267 --> 52:26.600
This guy?

52:26.726 --> 52:27.685
l mean...

52:27.811 --> 52:29.562
- No, dude,
you're probably fine.

52:29.688 --> 52:30.646
- You're just saying that.

52:30.772 --> 52:32.439
- Yeah, that's true,
but what do you want me to say,

52:32.566 --> 52:33.566
that you're right?

52:33.692 --> 52:34.650
- No, but-

52:34.776 --> 52:35.776
- Okay, look, look,

52:35.902 --> 52:37.945
chicks these days,
they don't want sexual supermen.

52:38.071 --> 52:41.740
Okay, they want hard workers,
you know, guys who hustle.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.200
And l mean, you look like
a hustler, Mike.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.370
l mean, you came all the way out
to Aberdeen, dude,

52:46.496 --> 52:48.164
and that's got to count
for something, right?

52:48.290 --> 52:50.541
Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:50.667 --> 52:53.085
- This guy's got shrubbery
shaped like pit bulls.

52:59.426 --> 53:02.428
[dogs barking]

53:33.501 --> 53:34.960
Dude, l think l got an idea

53:35.086 --> 53:36.962
for how you can
get your girl back.

53:37.088 --> 53:38.047
- Really?

53:38.173 --> 53:40.007
- See that dude
sitting over there?

53:40.133 --> 53:43.219
He runs a flight school
in Olympia.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.512
You should
talk to him, Mike.

53:51.686 --> 53:52.853
- Okay, Mike.

53:52.979 --> 53:56.023
What l need now is for you
to free your mind

53:56.149 --> 53:58.734
so as to have
a spiritually fulfilling,

53:58.860 --> 54:00.903
religious fucking moment.

54:01.029 --> 54:03.530
- l'm pretty sure
l can do it, Stan.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.574
- That's the Michael
l've come to know

54:05.700 --> 54:07.451
over the last
eight hours.

54:07.577 --> 54:08.577
That's the Mike.

54:11.331 --> 54:13.165
Come on, now.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.802
Three, two, one.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.178
- Wait, one sec!

54:26.304 --> 54:29.306
[screams]

54:34.062 --> 54:35.729
- Yeah.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.566
(Stan)
Okay, now, Mike.

54:39.693 --> 54:42.027
You're on your own!

54:54.165 --> 54:56.792
- [screaming]

54:56.918 --> 54:58.627
Whoo!

54:58.753 --> 55:01.046
[screaming]

55:08.638 --> 55:11.640
[Mike screaming]

55:12.434 --> 55:13.434
- Jesus!

55:13.560 --> 55:14.601
Oh, my God!

55:14.728 --> 55:18.939
Jango!

55:19.065 --> 55:20.399
Oh, my God.

55:20.525 --> 55:21.775
Who is-who is that?

55:21.901 --> 55:23.444
- Sue, it's me, Mike.

55:24.404 --> 55:25.446
- Mike?

55:25.572 --> 55:26.822
- Sue!

55:26.948 --> 55:28.115
- What are you doing?

55:28.241 --> 55:29.491
Mike, come here.

55:29.617 --> 55:31.285
[silenced gunshots]

55:31.411 --> 55:32.369
Jango, stop with the BBs!

55:32.495 --> 55:33.495
l know him.

55:33.621 --> 55:35.664
- What the fuck's going on?

55:35.790 --> 55:37.666
- Come here.
Mike, come here.

55:37.792 --> 55:38.917
Jango, stop shooting people.

55:39.044 --> 55:40.002
Stop it.

55:40.128 --> 55:41.128
Come here to me.
Follow my hands.

55:41.254 --> 55:42.254
Follow the noise.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.006
[gunshots]
Stop it!

55:44.132 --> 55:45.215
Come on.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.675
There you go.
Here l am.

55:46.801 --> 55:48.969
l got you.
l got you.

55:49.095 --> 55:50.304
Why?

55:50.430 --> 55:52.139
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

55:52.265 --> 55:53.265
- Back away.

55:53.391 --> 55:54.350
Sue.

55:54.476 --> 55:55.476
- Jango, give me the gun.

55:55.602 --> 55:56.560
Give me the damn gun.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.312
- l think l'm dying.
- lt's just BBs.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.230
- No, l mean,
l really think l'm dying.

56:00.357 --> 56:01.732
- Move back, Sue.

56:01.858 --> 56:03.692
Clear.
- Ow!

56:03.818 --> 56:04.818
- Jango!

56:04.944 --> 56:06.737
What are you doing?
- CPR!

56:06.863 --> 56:09.156
- Oh, my God,
l'm calling an ambulance.

56:09.282 --> 56:10.699
Okay.

56:10.825 --> 56:13.327
Well, thatjust looks like
you're kissing him, Jango.

56:28.468 --> 56:34.390
- Hi.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.433
- Where am l?

56:36.559 --> 56:38.018
- The Aberdeen Medical Center.

56:38.144 --> 56:41.146
[slurping]

56:41.773 --> 56:43.774
- Did-did-

56:43.900 --> 56:45.567
- Yeah, Jango shot you,

56:45.693 --> 56:49.154
which caused you
to go into shock.

56:50.615 --> 56:54.326
Mike, why?

56:54.452 --> 56:57.913
Why did you come out here?

56:58.039 --> 57:00.666
- Because l love you.

57:05.296 --> 57:07.756
Do l have BB holes
in my neck?

57:07.882 --> 57:08.882
- Yeah.

57:09.008 --> 57:10.676
- They hurt.
- l can imagine.

57:13.304 --> 57:15.222
- l thought it was over
with that guy.

57:15.348 --> 57:17.933
- He's good to me, Mike.

57:18.059 --> 57:21.270
He put me in charge of his
company's nonprofit yogurt fund,

57:21.396 --> 57:24.606
which allows me to do a lot of
good things for a lot of people.

57:24.732 --> 57:26.942
He also feels horrible
about shooting you,

57:27.068 --> 57:30.612
and he would like
to have you over for dinner.

57:30.738 --> 57:33.365
- Oh, that's nice.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.746
- So who's this guy?

57:39.873 --> 57:41.832
- That is...

57:41.958 --> 57:44.209
me and Joe Strummer

57:44.335 --> 57:47.588
in the summer of '79
at the 1 00 club in London.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.339
- Who's Joe Strummer?

57:49.466 --> 57:52.801
- Joe Strummer most likely
made love to your mother, Al,

57:52.927 --> 57:54.720
and then wrote
a song about it.

57:54.846 --> 57:55.846
Here's the two of us

57:55.972 --> 57:57.639
throwing up together
at the CBGB's.

57:57.765 --> 58:00.893
- Hey, who is that?

58:01.019 --> 58:02.102
- Oh.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.479
That's me and Ed McMahon,

58:03.605 --> 58:06.106
Ed Mc-wild-man.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.318
Now, he's a true punk.

58:09.444 --> 58:14.156
Basically, for me,
dog work is a thrill,

58:14.282 --> 58:15.782
an adrenaline rush,
if you will,

58:15.909 --> 58:17.367
that's otherwise
hard for me

58:17.494 --> 58:19.495
to replicate
in the world of yogurt.

58:19.621 --> 58:21.538
- Especially now
that you're not a punk.

58:21.664 --> 58:25.918
- Well, l'll always be a punk
in here, Al, make no mistake.

58:26.044 --> 58:29.463
But there's less need for me
to call myself a punk

58:29.589 --> 58:32.716
in a world when the very notion
of punkdom

58:32.842 --> 58:36.053
has been commodified
for the mass market.

58:36.179 --> 58:37.137
- Okay.

58:37.263 --> 58:38.889
- How do you like your marsala?

58:39.015 --> 58:40.474
- lt's really good.

58:40.600 --> 58:41.600
- Yeah?

58:41.726 --> 58:44.061
- Oh, you're not gonna eat any?

58:44.187 --> 58:45.771
- No, l-l liquefied it.

58:45.897 --> 58:48.190
Listen, l would just like
to formally

58:48.316 --> 58:51.401
and quite sincerely apologize
to you

58:51.528 --> 58:53.987
for the BB gun incident.

58:54.113 --> 58:55.197
l lost my cool.

58:55.323 --> 58:56.573
l was scared for Sue,

58:56.699 --> 58:58.283
scared for the dogs,

58:58.409 --> 59:01.370
scared for the general
well-being of the pool.

59:01.496 --> 59:03.455
So l just want to say
that l'm-

59:03.581 --> 59:05.707
l'm sorry, M-

59:05.833 --> 59:06.833
- Mike.

59:06.960 --> 59:10.504
- My friend. l blundered.

59:10.630 --> 59:12.172
- Yeah, that's all right.

59:12.298 --> 59:15.926
- Yeah, so now that's
behind us.

59:16.052 --> 59:18.387
And Sue tells me
that-that you're a painter.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.013
[Sue clears throat]

59:20.139 --> 59:21.431
- Yeah, very...

59:21.558 --> 59:24.142
very talented painter.

59:24.269 --> 59:25.811
- When did you have
the opportunity

59:25.937 --> 59:27.980
to become acquainted
with his work, Sue?

59:28.106 --> 59:31.858
- That was-it was my
last business trip

59:31.985 --> 59:33.902
for Corporate Bliss.

59:34.028 --> 59:35.028
- Hmm.

59:35.154 --> 59:38.448
And you saw her
and thought,

59:38.575 --> 59:42.452
"Great opportunity
to promote my art,"

59:42.579 --> 59:45.747
or you thought,
"Beautiful woman"?

59:47.125 --> 59:50.043
- The first part-one-
the art one.

59:50.169 --> 59:52.087
- Now, and so you're the guy

59:52.213 --> 59:55.924
who paints foxes and hounds
for corporate art?

59:56.050 --> 59:57.384
- Yeah.

59:57.510 --> 59:59.303
- Okay, 'cause l've got
something to say about that.

59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.888
You take a Rottweiler-

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:05.976
well, no, let's say
a Malinois chasing a fox,

01:00:06.102 --> 01:00:08.687
you got a seriously
new dynamic on your hands,

01:00:08.813 --> 01:00:10.272
because a Malinois

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:12.024
on a fox's ass,

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.568
that'd be a trip,

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:18.572
because a Malinois is gonna
turn that little fox

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:21.366
into fox meat
inside of 23 seconds.

01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:22.659
You know what l'm saying?

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.120
So l'd just like to lobby
for that a little bit.

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:26.246
- Okay.

01:00:26.372 --> 01:00:28.081
- That was really
great chicken, Jango.

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:29.791
- l love that fucking chicken,
Jango.

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:32.419
- Oh, hey, you had
better chicken than that,

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:33.920
you'd have to be
a rooster.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:37.049
[laughter]

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.968
Oh, hey, speaking of,

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.261
who's up for some dessert?

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:42.554
- Wow.

- Thank you, Father.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:59.725
- Needless to say,
your immersion

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.853
in the duty of carrot chopper

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:05.356
and broom chief
has been full and complete.

01:14:05.482 --> 01:14:06.983
- Thank you.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.193
- But some worries
have arisen.

01:14:09.319 --> 01:14:10.736
- Such as what, Father?

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:11.904
- Well, first of all,

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:15.241
you're not supposed
to call me Father.

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:16.325
- Oh.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.870
- But l must say, l admit,
l've grown fond of it.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:22.081
Michael...

01:14:22.207 --> 01:14:26.335
an aspiring bodhisattva
such as yourself

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:30.131
should seek to produce a heart
that does not dwell.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:32.300
- Of course, father.

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:37.054
- And your heart, Michael,
may l say, it does dwell.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:38.473
- No, it doesn't.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:39.640
- lt does, Michael.

01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:43.436
You have not transcended
your earthly passions.

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:48.107
To put it bluntly,
you are stuck.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.569
You also spend too much time
playing volleyball.

01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:55.072
- Yeah, but l thought
that was permitted, Father.

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.282
- Yes, but not
for seven hours a day.

01:14:56.408 --> 01:15:00.077
- Also, you encouraged it
for stress release.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.330
- Yes, l did, yes.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.165
But, Michael,

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.584
Buddhist monks
aren't supposed to have

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:10.213
seven hours a day
worth of stress.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:14.050
We are Buddhist monks,
Buddhist monks.

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.307
- So what should l do?

01:15:21.433 --> 01:15:24.977
- My parents died
when l was ten.

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:28.022
Two months later,
my uncle and l moved to America.

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:31.275
l was forced to let go
of everything l knew

01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:34.278
in order to move on.

01:15:34.404 --> 01:15:37.865
Sometimes in life,
you must do that.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.036
- Where are you from, Father?

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:46.707
- Vietnam,
Hau Nghia Province.

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:52.171
My parents were killed
in the war.

01:15:52.297 --> 01:15:53.422
- By the Americans?

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.008
- Yes.

01:15:56.134 --> 01:15:57.468
And yet l moved here.

01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:01.973
Life is odd.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.353
- l'm sorry.

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:08.980
- No, no, no.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:12.608
lt is not your fault.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.861
Let go, Mike.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:19.240
Let go and move on.

01:17:35.525 --> 01:17:36.984
- l recog-noodle you.

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:38.944
- Yeah, l'm the guy who
sold you my mom's necklace.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:41.656
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:43.324
What can l do you for?

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.825
- l want it back.

01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:02.593
Dad.

01:18:02.719 --> 01:18:05.346
Do you want me
to make you some dinner?

01:18:05.472 --> 01:18:08.307
- No, l'm all right.

01:18:08.433 --> 01:18:11.268
- Okay.

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:22.405
Dad, when you were over
in Vietnam,

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:27.868
did you ever do any fighting
in the Hau Nghia Province?

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:36.252
- Yeah.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.129
Why?

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.676
- l just met this guy
up at the monastery

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:47.596
who's from that area.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.391
He seemed to really
have his shit together.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:55.813
- Good to hear.

01:19:09.369 --> 01:19:10.327
- Dad, l've been thinking.

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:12.121
Maybe you should
sell this place.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.332
You don't even
like it here.

01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:17.626
This was Mom's thing.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.004
- Why do you say that?

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.799
- 'Cause it's true.

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:26.635
Come on, Mom loved people,
loved running things.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.095
lt's not like you.

01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:30.598
You're not like
a people person, Dad.

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:35.352
You should let it go.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:37.480
Move on.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.939
Otherwise,
you're just gonna rot.

01:19:39.065 --> 01:19:40.441
- Sell it and do what?

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:41.525
- Anything.

01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:42.735
You still have time.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:43.861
You'd have money.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:47.948
- What do you need, Mike,
a loan?

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.535
- No.

01:19:51.661 --> 01:19:56.457
l just wanted to say that this
doesn't have to be it...

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:02.671
And that l love you.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:26.028
- "Dear Mike,

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.364
" l know you probably don't want
to hear from me,

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.866
"and l can't say l blame you.

01:20:30.992 --> 01:20:33.994
"But l wanted to write anyway
to let you know what l think,

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:37.998
"which is that l think
you had a point that day

01:20:38.124 --> 01:20:41.001
"about people who hide
behind their causes

01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:43.420
"in order to avoid their lives.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.552
"You had a point down there
in that basement,

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:53.889
"with the soy sauce
and the mice.

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:58.811
"And so l wanted to say thanks.

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:04.108
"Because of you, Mike,
l'm not the same person l was.

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:05.901
"Good-bye, Mike.

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:08.195
Love, Sue."

01:21:14.327 --> 01:21:17.162
- So l thought about
what you said the other day.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:23.043
l think you had a point.

01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:26.380
That being said,
this is yours.

01:21:27.757 --> 01:21:28.757
- What is it?

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.760
- Deed to the motel,
signed over to you.

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.182
- Dad, that's not-
that's not why-

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:39.602
- lt's fine.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:42.813
l don't need it.

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:44.273
Your mom was good
about that.

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:47.818
You-you can'tjust give me
the motel.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.070
- lt's your birthright.

01:21:52.365 --> 01:21:54.241
- What would you do?

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:57.077
- l want to get in shape,

01:21:57.203 --> 01:22:00.706
maybe join one of those
basketball leagues.

01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:04.543
How about you?

01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:05.669
- l don't know.

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:09.006
l'll think of something.

01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:10.215
- You done
with the monk stuff?

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:14.553
- Yeah, l'll still
occasionally do it,

01:22:14.679 --> 01:22:17.181
l mean,
not professionally, but-

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:23.020
- What about that girl?

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:27.942
- Oh, that didn't work out.

01:22:28.068 --> 01:22:34.573
Yeah, we weren't, you know,
like, meant for each other.

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:37.910
- l don't know, Mike.

01:22:38.036 --> 01:22:40.120
Things change in life.

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.958
- What do you mean?

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:46.418
- You're not
the same guy you were.

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:56.553
Good soup.

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:03.352
- Good soup.

01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:18.450
You can do this, Mike.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.291
- So l'm gonna hit
the gym.

01:23:26.418 --> 01:23:27.876
- Oh, yeah?

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.503
- Yeah, they have
a senior citizen hoop run

01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:33.173
from 3:00 to 5:00.

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:34.258
Got a new ball.

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:36.385
- Yeah, l see.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:39.430
- All right, Mike.

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:40.556
- See you.

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:53.986
- Hello?

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.988
- Hi, Jango,
it's Mike, Sue's friend.

01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:57.114
- Hi, Mike.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.992
- Hi, look, l know
that l'm probably not the guy

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:01.201
you want to hear from right now,

01:24:01.327 --> 01:24:03.954
but l need to tell Sue
about what l'm doing down here.

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.122
And l think that when she hears

01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:06.623
what l'm up to,
she'll at least understand

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:07.833
that if nothing else-

01:24:07.959 --> 01:24:08.959
- Mike?

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.210
- Yeah.

01:24:10.336 --> 01:24:12.046
- We split up.

01:24:12.172 --> 01:24:14.506
Sue and l split up.

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:16.675
She left me...

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:19.470
went back to Maryland
