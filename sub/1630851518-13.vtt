WEBVTT

00:25.460 --> 00:28.419
Save some energy for
the actual meeting, mamita.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.530
- Good morning.
- <i>Hey, morning.</i>

00:52.574 --> 00:55.011
I need one of
your Sully pep talks.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.534
Oh, okay.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.362
I have to deliver a lot
of bad news this morning,

00:58.406 --> 01:01.191
and contrary to what many
in this department may think,

01:01.235 --> 01:03.498
I don't actually enjoy
doing that.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.500
Alright, well...

01:05.543 --> 01:10.809
you are
Natasha Seo-yeon Ross.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.681
<i>You are powerful.</i>
<i>You are impressive.</i>

01:12.724 --> 01:14.726
You are inspiring.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.947
You are --
You're beautiful.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.689
And all who meet you
admire you.

01:20.732 --> 01:22.517
You were put here
to do a job,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.301
because no one else can do
this job better than you,

01:24.345 --> 01:26.390
and everyone sees it.

01:26.434 --> 01:29.393
And if they don't,
screw them,

01:29.437 --> 01:31.961
because they weren't gonna be
of use to you anyway.

01:34.137 --> 01:35.704
This is good.
This is good.

01:35.747 --> 01:38.707
Keep it coming.

01:38.750 --> 01:41.144
Well, you are faster,
you're stronger,

01:41.188 --> 01:44.191
you're smarter
than most guys out there.

01:44.234 --> 01:47.716
Who gives a crap
what's under your camis?

01:47.759 --> 01:49.631
Look, if they want to cry
and say

01:49.674 --> 01:52.373
that's why Sarge picked you
as my spotter, let them.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.940
In fairness to them,
we are close. People talk.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.726
Look, Tash,

01:57.769 --> 01:59.206
You earned your promotion

01:59.249 --> 02:02.687
because you are better
than them, period.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.950
But if they want to give you
flak for that,

02:04.994 --> 02:07.779
it's because
they're sexist,

02:07.823 --> 02:09.694
which means
they're stupid,

02:09.738 --> 02:11.435
which means they're not
gonna last long in the Marines.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.396
Thanks,
Lance Corporal.

02:15.439 --> 02:16.875
You don't have to
call me that.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.487
Alright.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.184
Thanks, Sully.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.448
How long have we been
out here now?

02:24.492 --> 02:25.928
Six hours, man.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.715
Movement.

02:34.415 --> 02:35.981
Mm.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.461
It's just
a delivery bike.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.429
Is it true, uh,
Chief Ross is coming in today?

02:48.472 --> 02:49.995
Yep, she is.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.345
I'm obsessed with her.

02:51.388 --> 02:54.391
Ex-military,
first female chief of SFD,

02:54.435 --> 02:55.653
and a Black woman.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.438
Yeah, she is impressive.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.135
It's just...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.224
I don't know,
s-seeing female leadership

03:01.268 --> 03:02.965
in the department is important,
you know?

03:03.008 --> 03:05.489
It's someone
to look up to.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.579
Are you...

03:08.623 --> 03:10.233
Hey, Chief's here.

03:10.277 --> 03:13.280
Chief, good morning.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.108
Hi, uh, so, before you make
any announcements,

03:16.152 --> 03:17.936
can we revisit
the conversation?

03:17.980 --> 03:19.242
Look, it's --
it's a really good house.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.723
Herrera, I try not to make
a habit of waffling.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.291
You make a decision,
you stand by it, good or bad.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.901
Chief --

03:25.944 --> 03:27.032
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:27.076 --> 03:29.948
I won't take up
too much of your time.

03:29.992 --> 03:32.124
I want to thank you all
for your hard work

03:32.168 --> 03:34.301
and your dedication
to this community,

03:34.344 --> 03:36.259
but it pains me
to inform you

03:36.303 --> 03:37.739
that Station 23
will be closing.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.131
What?
What?

03:39.175 --> 03:40.481
- Are you kidding me?
- We're closing?

03:40.524 --> 03:43.310
Hey, hey.
23, your Chief is speaking.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.486
I understand
this isn't great news.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.315
You'll finish out the week,
then Stations 19 and 57

03:48.358 --> 03:50.142
will be absorbing
your call district.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.797
Some of you
will be reassigned.

03:52.841 --> 03:55.278
I know you have questions,
and I want to assure you,

03:55.322 --> 03:56.584
the department
is here for you.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.325
Here for us?

03:58.368 --> 03:59.761
- Yeah, Chief,
- I have a question.
- Hmm?

03:59.804 --> 04:01.806
Why?

04:08.204 --> 04:11.251
I'm sorry, folks.
You have done good work.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.817
In the end,
this is just about numbers.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.645
Look at 19.

04:14.689 --> 04:17.387
Their Crisis One program
and the new clinic

04:17.431 --> 04:20.956
reduced low acuity calls
by an estimated 29%.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.827
That frees up
a lot of time,

04:22.871 --> 04:25.221
and we found that we don't need
two stations so close together.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.006
You'll be receiving
your reassignments

04:28.050 --> 04:29.747
or your severance notices
by the end of the week,

04:29.791 --> 04:31.271
after the closing ceremony.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.838
In the meantime,
keep serving Seattle,

04:33.882 --> 04:36.319
like you always have.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.712
Thank you.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.759
So this is 19's fault,
huh?

04:41.803 --> 04:43.283
That's not
what she said.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.328
Are you kidding?
Is this a joke?

04:50.768 --> 04:53.336
Oh, Warren and Dr. Bailey
have that meeting

04:53.380 --> 04:55.077
with the Millers today.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.122
I swear, if we don't get
that baby, I am going to sue.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.341
You want
some more coffee?

04:58.385 --> 05:01.388
No, I'm drinking...
tea.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.346
Glad to see you're handling
the breakup so well.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.521
Wait, they finally
broke up?

05:04.565 --> 05:06.654
Yeah, they did.

05:06.697 --> 05:09.396
Is it a breakup if neither of
you say the words "break up"?

05:09.439 --> 05:11.354
Mm, when's the last time
you spoke to him?

05:11.398 --> 05:13.095
Three days ago, when he said,
"Don't ever call me again."

05:13.138 --> 05:15.184
Yeah, that sounds exactly like
a breakup.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.231
Oh, my God.
They're shutting 23 down.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.450
What?

05:20.494 --> 05:21.756
Just like that?
Shutting it down?

05:21.799 --> 05:23.192
They can do that?

05:23.235 --> 05:24.411
This is all the information
I have.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.890
"Chief just showed up
and shut us down."

05:25.934 --> 05:27.501
So...like, what now?

05:27.544 --> 05:30.895
Does Herrera come back?
Does Theo come here?

05:30.939 --> 05:32.723
Oh, God.
I hope not.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.074
Couples that work together
never work out. That's all --

05:36.118 --> 05:37.902
That's not true!
Michael and I.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.904
Herrera and Sullivan?
Herrera and Gibson?

05:39.948 --> 05:42.385
- Gibson and Bishop?
- Okay, I'm feeling
a little attacked.

05:42.429 --> 05:43.865
- You and Emmett.
- Okay, those are
good points.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.736
Yeah.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.522
<i>Crisis One requested</i>
<i>to 328 Birch Pond Street.</i>

05:48.565 --> 05:50.393
- Great, speaking of Emmett.
- See?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.699
This is why you shouldn't
work with boyfriends.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.440
'Cause boyfriends become
ex-boyfriends.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.230
Hey.
You're gonna do great.

06:01.273 --> 06:03.145
I am great.
I just need the Chief to see it.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.547
I thought you were going
to a meeting.
I was.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.505
And then I got drunk.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.812
Well, I-I guess
you need another meeting.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.030
This how
it's gonna be now?

06:19.074 --> 06:20.423
You keeping tabs on me
every day?

06:22.512 --> 06:24.340
You know 23 got shut down,
right?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.037
Budget cuts?

06:26.081 --> 06:28.562
Which means the department
is sniffing out

06:28.605 --> 06:31.042
any little problem
at a station,

06:31.086 --> 06:33.001
and we are all under
a microscope.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.133
If you don't
get your act right,

06:35.177 --> 06:37.005
you're gonna get 19
shut down.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.442
By "department,"
do you mean your lady friend?

06:39.486 --> 06:41.749
She's not gonna do that
to you.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.620
You know,
with 23 closing,

06:43.664 --> 06:45.492
there are two captains
who need new assignments,

06:45.535 --> 06:47.407
and you're not well.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.759
You need to get well
before you hit a bottom

06:51.802 --> 06:52.847
you can't come back from.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.217
I mean, maybe we should
just report our relationship

07:15.260 --> 07:16.871
to the department so they're
forced to keep us apart?

07:16.914 --> 07:18.220
Hey, have you asked Theo

07:18.263 --> 07:19.874
if he even wants
to transfer to 19?

07:19.917 --> 07:21.484
Well, why wouldn't he?
Everybody does.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.616
I called the police.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.661
Yes, we are Seattle Fire.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.836
I'm Travis, and you are...

07:25.880 --> 07:27.925
Virginia.
There's no fire.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.753
I just need a tenant
kicked out.

07:29.797 --> 07:33.017
Uh, okay, well, we have
a-a program called Crisis One

07:33.061 --> 07:34.671
that handles special cases
like this.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.848
"Special case"?
It's just my bum tenant, Alan.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.415
He didn't pay
last month's rent,

07:39.459 --> 07:40.982
and now he's late
on this month's.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.636
- Okay.
- Been banging on his door,

07:42.679 --> 07:44.594
but he's obviously
dodging me.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.378
Oka-- Well, have you
tried entering?

07:46.422 --> 07:47.815
Not allowed.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.904
This state, I swear.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.993
Hey, when was the last time
you saw him enter or exit?

07:52.036 --> 07:55.170
A month or so ago,
but he's smart.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.651
He knows the minute
that he leaves...

07:57.694 --> 08:00.349
I am going
to be changing the locks!

08:00.392 --> 08:02.482
Alan!
Hey!

08:02.525 --> 08:04.309
People are here
to kick your ass out!

08:04.353 --> 08:06.660
- N-No.
- You better either
have a check

08:06.703 --> 08:09.227
or your crap packed up
and ready to beat it!

08:09.271 --> 08:11.708
Okay. Virginia.

08:11.752 --> 08:12.622
- Thank you.
- Virginia, please.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.537
We will take it from there.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.844
Hey.
Sorry, traffic.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.280
Oh, now, who's this?

08:18.323 --> 08:19.934
Uh, well, this is our
trained civilian responder,

08:19.977 --> 08:21.805
Emmett Dixon.
Whatever.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.764
Just get his ass
- out of there.
- Okay.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.812
Hi.
H-Hi.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.249
Alan?
Alan, are you home?

08:31.293 --> 08:32.642
This is Seattle Fire!

08:33.904 --> 08:35.950
We're not police,
so you don't have to be scared.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.389
- Halligan?
- Oh, Halligan, yeah.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.695
Okay.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.744
I'm gonna, um...

08:47.788 --> 08:49.746
Hey, Vic? Hey, wait up.
Wait up, wait.

08:49.790 --> 08:52.575
Look, I know everyone's
feeling punched in the gut,

08:52.619 --> 08:55.752
but we have to remember...

08:55.796 --> 08:58.450
we're still Station 23
firefighters,

08:58.494 --> 09:01.497
and until those doors are
chained up and we're locked out,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.412
- we still have a job to do.
Would you just stop?

09:03.455 --> 09:05.196
You never wanted to be here
in the first place.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.938
You've been trying
to jump ship since day one.

09:07.982 --> 09:11.507
Hey, Cap. Any way you can
take me to 19 with you?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.161
- Duval.
- I --

09:13.204 --> 09:14.641
Look, I don't know
where I'll end up,

09:14.684 --> 09:16.251
same as everyone else.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.514
<i>Ladder 23, Engine 23,</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:21.386
<i>and Aid Car 23 requested</i>
<i>at 460 Ryder Avenue.</i>

09:21.430 --> 09:23.258
You know, she probably
volunteered to give us the axe

09:23.301 --> 09:25.913
so that she could go back
to her precious 19.

09:25.956 --> 09:26.957
Bet you're right.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
You're an excellent firefighter,
excellent captain.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.267
Stay calm. Be direct.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.530
You're an excellent firefighter,
an excellent captain.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.837
- Lieutenant Bishop?
- Uh, Chief Ross.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.316
Um, hi. Hello.
Hey.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.014
I'm sorry. I must have
lost track of time.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.406
Oh, no.
No, I'm early.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.756
Uh, we cleared out
the conference room.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.322
It's right upstairs.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.802
Here's fine.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.195
Yeah, and feel free
to keep working.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.979
I find that moving around
helps me keep a clear head

09:49.023 --> 09:50.851
when I'm making important
decisions. Go ahead.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.549
Okay.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.422
So, Bishop.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.815
Your record is impressive.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.991
An Olympian,
a respected captain

10:01.035 --> 10:02.471
prior to your demotion.

10:02.514 --> 10:04.125
You've accomplished a lot
at a young age.

10:04.168 --> 10:06.040
So let me ask you this.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.520
What is your end goal here
in the fire department?

10:08.564 --> 10:10.305
Uh, fire chief.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.350
I know I have
to work my way up,

10:12.394 --> 10:13.830
but I am excited
to do what it takes

10:13.874 --> 10:15.484
to earn that position.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.573
I like ambition.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.793
And I appreciate
a work ethic like yours,

10:19.836 --> 10:21.272
and I don't want you to lose
sight of that goal

10:21.316 --> 10:23.666
despite the fact that I will not
be reinstating you

10:23.710 --> 10:24.841
as captain of 19.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.106
Chief, it was a matter
of life or death.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.455
That child is alive
because I prioritized

10:30.499 --> 10:31.935
his life over policy.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.328
I don't --Did you know I'm a Marine?

10:35.939 --> 10:40.901
When I was on my second tour
in Iraq...

10:40.944 --> 10:43.686
we were ambushed
one night.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.645
One of our guys was injured.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.082
He was way out of our range.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.040
Against orders,
this guy, Mikey,

10:50.084 --> 10:51.520
he went out to save him.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.696
He wanted to be a hero.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.742
And he --
he blew our cover.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.571
Mikey and that guy made it out,
but it cost the lives

10:59.615 --> 11:01.356
of more than half
of my team.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.795
You cannot isolate the fact
that that kid lived

11:05.839 --> 11:08.102
from the fact that
you openly defied the Chief,

11:08.145 --> 11:10.017
who knew more than you did
in that moment.

11:10.060 --> 11:13.020
Chief Ross, McCallister
demoted me for insubordination.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.152
The captain
he replaced me with

11:15.196 --> 11:16.980
left the doors
of our engine open

11:17.024 --> 11:18.982
and got it stolen
and destroyed.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.375
Did he face
any consequences?

11:20.418 --> 11:22.507
I'm not defending
McCallister's leadership,

11:22.551 --> 11:23.987
but I am upholding
his demotion.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.293
I believe he made
the right call on that.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.208
McCallister did not care
about the kid.

11:27.251 --> 11:29.906
He had it out for me from
day one because I condoned 19

11:29.950 --> 11:31.125
supporting
Black Lives Matter.

11:31.168 --> 11:32.953
Bishop.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.259
You really want that allegation
on your record at this time?

11:35.303 --> 11:37.740
Yes, McCallister
was problematic,

11:37.784 --> 11:40.438
but, Bishop, your inability
to do the job in spite of that

11:40.482 --> 11:42.353
is the problem.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.138
Your refusal to recognize that,
like it or not,

11:44.181 --> 11:45.661
being in the fire service
means adhering

11:45.705 --> 11:50.057
to a chain of command,
that was and <i>is</i> the problem.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.537
And frankly, the fact
that you have shown no remorse

11:52.581 --> 11:55.236
for any of this behavior
does not make me feel confident

11:55.279 --> 11:58.021
that you have any intention
of ever changing it.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.111
<i>Ladder 19 and Engine 19</i>

12:01.155 --> 12:03.635
<i>requested at 460 Ryder Avenue.</i>

12:03.679 --> 12:04.985
That's me.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.595
Go.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.344
I got it.
This is the one.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.432
Okay.

12:17.475 --> 12:18.868
And these, too.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.914
There we go. Yeah.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.742
- There we go there.
- Mm.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.483
Don't let Dr. Wright
see you like that.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.140
Hey, look,
i-it's not your fault

12:30.184 --> 12:31.794
that your resident
has the hots for you.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.405
But you tell him next time,
keep his hands to himself.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.016
It's not his hands
that were the problem.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.844
Yeah, well,
his lips, then.
Mm.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.718
Oh, they're here.
Okay.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.763
Okay.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.291
Hi, Randa.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.728
Hello!

12:52.772 --> 12:55.426
Hey.
Dr. Miranda Bailey.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.254
Pru has told me
so much about you.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.516
Oh.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.301
You're...Oh, I'm Anna, the nanny.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.129
- Oh. Okay.
- The nanny.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
Hi, Ben.
Hey.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.088
Are they not here yet?

13:05.132 --> 13:06.394
They had a last-minute
doctor's appointment.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.135
I guess
it's running late.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.571
They asked me to bring her over
and just meet them here,

13:09.614 --> 13:11.355
'cause I have
a hard out at --

13:11.399 --> 13:13.270
now.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.751
Bye.
See you soon, buddy.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.752
- Bye.
- Take care.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.058
Good to see youboth.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.842
Come on in.
Mm-hmm.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.496
You go with Grandpa?

13:21.539 --> 13:22.845
Alrighty.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.281
Aww.

13:24.325 --> 13:28.024
Um, can I, uh, get anyone
coffee or tea?

13:28.068 --> 13:30.157
I'd prefer it
if we just get to it.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.333
Okay, then, uh,
w-why don't we have a seat

13:32.376 --> 13:34.161
while we wait
for the guardian ad litem?

13:34.204 --> 13:36.903
Tabitha will no longer be
joining us today.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.427
My husband and I have decided,
uh, pending agreement

13:39.470 --> 13:42.212
around certain
visitation privileges,

13:42.256 --> 13:43.953
that, uh...

13:43.997 --> 13:47.348
the best arrangement
would be for you

13:47.391 --> 13:49.176
to take guardianship
of Arike.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.921
Exclusively.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.801
What the hell
are you doing to my door?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.064
I'm trying to open it,
Virginia.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.283
Are you thinking
mental breakdown?

14:09.326 --> 14:11.241
A mental breakdown,
incapacitation,

14:11.285 --> 14:13.069
medical emergency,
recovering from a bender.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.505
Who knows?
It could be anything.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.468
Oh, God.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.209
Alan!

14:22.252 --> 14:23.906
- Mm!
- Alan!

14:23.950 --> 14:26.082
Alan!

14:28.345 --> 14:30.130
Ugh!
Alan!

14:30.173 --> 14:31.871
Ugh!

14:31.914 --> 14:33.176
- Ugh.
- Oh!

14:33.220 --> 14:34.830
Oh!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.440
Oh, that's loud.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.659
Oh, my God.

14:37.702 --> 14:40.792
Oh.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.490
Oh, Alan.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.279
Saw Ross on my way out.
How did it go?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.630
What?
The sit-down.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.458
We didn't get to finish
because of the call.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.199
Well,
I'm pulling for you.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.767
Remember, she respects candor
and conviction.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.595
Yeah, thanks.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.292
Yep.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.033
<i>Heads up, 19.</i>

15:04.077 --> 15:05.469
<i>This is a candy factory,</i>
<i>so there's gonna be</i>

15:05.513 --> 15:07.471
<i>a lot of combustible</i>
<i>materials inside.</i>

15:07.515 --> 15:08.559
<i>Stay alert.</i>

15:13.564 --> 15:16.567
Alright, 19, I want the ladder
out front on standby.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.874
Ladder 19
is Search and Rescue.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.702
Gibson, Sullivan,
you're Fire Attack.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.922
Let's get water on this
before it gets any bigger.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.098
There are still people
stuck inside!

15:25.141 --> 15:27.448
- I haven't seen Stella!
- Do you work here?
You look injured.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.363
I work on the distribution
line, but I'm fine.

15:29.406 --> 15:32.409
You have to find Stella!
She's -- We're having a baby!

15:32.453 --> 15:34.890
What can you tell me
- about the layout?
- You gotta get her out!

15:34.934 --> 15:36.457
I'll get her out.
The layout will help.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.767
This is what
it looks like inside.

15:42.811 --> 15:46.336
The generator is over here
by the conveyor belts.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.514
Okay, this is helpful.
Thank you.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.778
Bishop, take Aid 23.
- Start triage.
- Okay.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.345
Sir, let's take a look
at these wounds, okay?

15:55.389 --> 15:57.086
- Let's go over here.
- Please find Stella!

15:57.130 --> 15:59.088
23 on scene.
What's the assignment?

15:59.132 --> 16:00.916
Herrera, I need you and Duval
to get a second hose line inside

16:00.960 --> 16:02.744
to back up Fire Attack.

16:02.787 --> 16:05.442
Ruiz, Barnes, help Ladder 19
with Search and Rescue.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.532
We have a pregnant woman inside,
last whereabouts unknown.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.838
Her name is Stella.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.710
Stella!

16:12.754 --> 16:14.408
Hey, 23.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.800
Sorry about your house.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.676
Hey, why hasn't
the power been cut?

16:21.719 --> 16:24.679
I guess this place
has its own generator.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.029
Beckett, we gotta
cut the generator!

16:27.073 --> 16:28.596
<i>Should be on</i>
<i>the northeast wall!</i>

16:28.639 --> 16:30.032
Copy.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.034
Okay, so, burning sugar
is worse than tar,

16:32.078 --> 16:34.428
and sugar dust
is basically TNT

16:34.471 --> 16:37.344
once it gets hot enough,
so stay alert in there.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.910
- Let's go!
- Yep!

16:46.005 --> 16:49.051
Furthermore, nurturing
Arike's Nigerian heritage

16:49.095 --> 16:51.010
is of utmost importance.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.315
Absolutely.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.056
Uh, the Laus feel
equally passionate

16:54.100 --> 16:55.971
about her exposure to
and nurturing of

16:56.015 --> 16:57.538
her Chinese culture.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.540
Yeah, and we're deeply
committed to both.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.977
I mean, even our boys
are excited.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.371
Yeah, J-Joey found this, uh,
Nigerian grocery store

17:04.414 --> 17:06.068
over on 7th,
and he's become

17:06.112 --> 17:08.636
very, uh, "MasterChef"-y
about things.

17:10.072 --> 17:13.249
Well, anyway,
there are a few other things

17:13.293 --> 17:16.252
we'd like to get clear on
before this becomes settled law.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.949
Bill and I propose
that we have her

17:17.993 --> 17:21.605
for Memorial Day weekends,
4th of July, Thanksgiving,

17:21.649 --> 17:24.304
Christmas, New Year's,
and we'd like two weeks

17:24.347 --> 17:26.480
out of her summers with the Laus
to travel with her.

17:26.523 --> 17:29.309
And we're open
to alternating birthdays.

17:34.749 --> 17:39.493
Okay, we a-absolutely
think it's important

17:39.536 --> 17:43.105
for Pru to spend
some holidays with you, but --

17:43.149 --> 17:45.716
But t-that's, um --

17:45.760 --> 17:48.110
Well, that's every holiday.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.807
It's not enough
that you have her

17:49.851 --> 17:51.505
for the majority
of her life?

17:51.548 --> 17:53.289
We're allowing you
to win here.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.465
You get her
for all of the time!

17:55.509 --> 17:57.728
And yet --

17:57.772 --> 18:00.862
"And yet"?
And yet, you keep
fighting us at every turn.

18:00.905 --> 18:01.993
I don't think
that that's true.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.430
I don't think
that's what's happening.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.605
Okay, what you're proposing
is absurd.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.302
- Excuse me?
- Okay -- No.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.956
L-Let's just try to remember
that Pru is napping

18:07.999 --> 18:09.175
in the next room,
so let's keep it all --No.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.351
No, we do not accept.

18:14.919 --> 18:15.964
Um...

18:17.444 --> 18:19.141
Ugh.
Is he --

18:19.185 --> 18:20.969
Yeah, for a while. I wouldn't
recommend going in there.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.101
Oh, crap.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.928
Did he stain my floor?

18:23.972 --> 18:26.105
We're really sorry,
Virginia?

18:26.148 --> 18:28.019
Yeah, he probably --

18:28.063 --> 18:29.630
probably ran out
of insulin.

18:29.673 --> 18:30.892
He -- I guess
- he couldn't afford it.
- Oh, geez.

18:30.935 --> 18:32.807
I didn't even know
he was sick!

18:32.850 --> 18:34.939
Wait, no one even noticed that
he was gone for a whole month?

18:34.983 --> 18:36.593
No one to help him
get his medication?

18:36.637 --> 18:39.205
He just...had no one?

18:39.248 --> 18:41.294
<i>Aid Car 19 requested</i>
<i>to 460 Ryder Avenue.</i>

18:41.337 --> 18:42.904
Oh, that's us.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.514
Oh, no, wait.
You can't leave.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.994
Who's gonna clean up
Alan?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.561
I-I'll wait until
the police arrive

18:47.604 --> 18:48.605
- and write up the report.
- Okay, thank you.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.868
Um...Is he really dead?

18:50.912 --> 18:52.174
Yes.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.175
I'm sorry.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.959
You seemed...close.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.179
Damn.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.184
Stella!
Can you hear us?!

19:02.228 --> 19:03.707
Stella!

19:03.751 --> 19:05.535
Where are all
the Oompa Loompas?

19:05.579 --> 19:08.669
Maybe they went on strike
and set the place on fire.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.627
Cap, hold on.

19:10.671 --> 19:12.586
The floor is mega sticky.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.675
We gotta keep moving!

19:14.718 --> 19:16.459
Come on, let's go.
We stay in one place too long

19:16.503 --> 19:18.374
and we'll need rescuing.

19:36.610 --> 19:37.872
There's probably enough
sugar dust in here

19:37.915 --> 19:39.439
to bring down
the whole building!

19:39.482 --> 19:41.223
Then we need
to cut the power

19:41.267 --> 19:42.616
before those fans spread it
all over the place.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.409
Hey, hey!

19:53.453 --> 19:55.846
Does that look like
a power box to you?

19:55.890 --> 19:57.239
Yeah!
Alright.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.071
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:07.380 --> 20:08.381
Dammit!

20:10.861 --> 20:13.168
Incident Command, there's no
generator controls here.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.390
And the air's starting
to get spicy.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.961
Have they found Stella yet?
Maybe you could go help them.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.963
Okay, we have an excellent team
of firefighters in there.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.791
We all have our jobs to do.
Mine is to help you.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.489
Helping me would be
finding my girlfriend.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.230
She's pregnant.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.883
I didn't want her working,
but she kept saying

20:32.927 --> 20:34.276
we couldn't afford
for her not to.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.583
Hey, Blondie, you almost done
with that Lifepak?

20:36.626 --> 20:37.975
'Cause I need it.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.500
Or does 19 get
all the equipment, too?

20:40.543 --> 20:42.589
Maddox, I am sorry that
they're closing your station,

20:42.632 --> 20:44.286
but that is not my fault.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.940
Right.
They're closing
a fire station?

20:45.983 --> 20:47.855
What does that mean?
Are there enough guys inside?

20:47.898 --> 20:49.639
There are enough people
in there,

20:49.683 --> 20:51.075
and they're all
very good at their job.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.860
<i>Gibson, Sullivan.</i>

20:52.903 --> 20:54.688
<i>The generator should be</i>
<i>on the northeast wall.</i>

20:54.731 --> 20:56.211
<i>We're here, sir, </i>
<i> but there's no generator.</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:58.082
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's on the left.

20:58.126 --> 20:59.780
Southwest,
in the basement.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.477
He's reading it
upside down.
Are you sure?

21:01.521 --> 21:02.870
I've worked here
for eight years.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.263
I drew the map
for your captain.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.398
Captain, the generator
is on the southwest wall

21:09.442 --> 21:10.704
of the basement.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.360
Beckett.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.886
I thought you said
you were good at your jobs!

21:20.235 --> 21:22.977
Incident Command,
this is Herrera.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.893
Duval and I are on
the southeast wall.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.678
We're looking at something that
looks kind of like a distillery.

21:28.722 --> 21:30.680
<i>That is the hopper.</i>

21:30.724 --> 21:31.725
<i>Herrera, if you and Duval</i>
<i>can close the hopper chute</i>

21:31.768 --> 21:33.335
<i>and stop the sugar flow,</i>

21:33.379 --> 21:35.555
<i>that'll make 19's job</i>
<i>a lot easier.</i>

21:35.598 --> 21:37.774
Gibson, Sullivan,
stay on Fire Attack.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.301
We gotta stop this.
Here.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.345
Jam it.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.053
Okay.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.142
Alright,
I need you to pull.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.928
On three --
one, two, three!

22:04.323 --> 22:07.064
Is there somebody here?!

22:07.108 --> 22:10.329
Please help me!
I can't see!

22:10.372 --> 22:13.593
Duval, go help her
until Ruiz can get her out!

22:15.421 --> 22:19.207
Barnes, Ruiz!
We've located your victim!

22:19.250 --> 22:21.775
She's on the southeast wall.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.956
Beckett!

22:28.999 --> 22:31.219
Beckett!

22:31.262 --> 22:33.743
Patient says that
you have the map upside down.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.092
What?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.966
The generator is on the
southwest wall of the basement.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.797
Gibson,
the generator is on

22:43.840 --> 22:46.756
the southwest wall
of the basement.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.584
Oh, God, do I still have

22:48.628 --> 22:50.412
the smell of rotting Alan
in my nostrils, or is --

22:50.456 --> 22:52.414
- I think it's pixie dust.
- Triage.

22:55.156 --> 22:57.854
- I think Theo's in there.
- He'll be outside soon.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.508
Duval, I need you
to get back here!

22:59.552 --> 23:00.814
Ruiz, here, take over.

23:00.857 --> 23:03.730
Go ahead, Duval.
We got her.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.166
I need you
to find something

23:05.209 --> 23:07.298
that's gonna give us
some leverage!

23:07.342 --> 23:09.126
Alright, I'm gonna
put this mask on you.

23:09.170 --> 23:10.824
It'll help you
breathe better, okay?

23:11.955 --> 23:13.609
Yeah, that!

23:15.872 --> 23:17.831
Ah, perfect.
Alright, ready?

23:17.874 --> 23:20.442
- Okay, you pull, I push.
- Okay.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.313
One, two, three.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.151
Oh!

23:34.195 --> 23:36.023
Incident Command,
this is Herrera.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.677
The hopper is closed.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.680
Good work, Herrera.
19, knock down that fire!

23:40.723 --> 23:44.031
Whoo!
Good work, Duval.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.641
<i>Sullivan, abort</i>
<i>generator mission.</i>

23:45.685 --> 23:47.077
<i>Knock down that fire!</i>

23:49.602 --> 23:50.820
Roger that, base.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.434
So, what are you gonna do when
you're done with the uniform?

23:55.477 --> 23:56.870
When you get out, huh?

23:59.263 --> 24:02.876
Get me a 9:00 to 5:00,
get married,

24:02.919 --> 24:05.226
have five kids,
kiddie pool in the backyard.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.401
The whole package.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.446
Five?

24:08.751 --> 24:10.971
Dang, I feel sorry
for whoever ends up with you.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.017
What about you?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.323
What are you gonna do
when you're out?

24:15.366 --> 24:16.585
Nothing.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.500
This.

24:18.544 --> 24:19.762
This, I can do forever.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.111
This is what
I'm built for.

24:21.155 --> 24:23.287
No, no.
No, you're not.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.202
Nobody is.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.555
You see yourself
as the marrying kind?

24:29.598 --> 24:31.339
Nah.

24:31.382 --> 24:34.734
All the good guys want
this "whole package" business.

24:39.826 --> 24:42.132
We got movement.
Lights are on.

24:44.961 --> 24:47.224
Target acquired.
Give me a read.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.009
Looks like 1.5 MILS.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.750
- Roger that, 1.5 MILS.
- Mm-hmm.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.578
Slight
left-to-right wind.

24:52.621 --> 24:55.406
Dial in 2.84 MILS.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.147
Spotters up.

24:57.191 --> 24:58.888
Ready to engage.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.368
Your shot is clear.
Send it.

25:06.853 --> 25:09.682
Sullivan.
Take the shot.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.293
Sullivan.

25:12.336 --> 25:13.468
I'm not gonna blow the back
of this guy's head off

25:13.512 --> 25:15.035
in front of his kids.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.471
Sullivan, you got
a clear shot.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.864
You got --

25:39.929 --> 25:42.236
When I tell you
to take the shot, you take it.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.458
Miranda, Miranda --

25:47.502 --> 25:50.592
No, no, no, no.
Ben, no.

25:50.636 --> 25:53.203
I'm not gonna just sit there
and be talked to like that.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.466
I understand, but --This is not a deal, it's --

25:55.510 --> 25:56.990
The fact that
we're even discussing it

25:57.033 --> 25:58.861
as if it is a deal
is absurd.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.385
I know, I know,
but we need to calm down.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.823
Just listen to me,
Miranda.

26:03.866 --> 26:04.954
What?

26:06.347 --> 26:08.088
Miran--

26:08.131 --> 26:11.395
Um, your son
put it in writing,

26:11.439 --> 26:16.618
and you...are
in no position

26:16.662 --> 26:19.273
to care for this child
on your own.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.970
Okay, Mir--And you both know it.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.668
Okay, Miranda, let's just
take things --

26:22.711 --> 26:25.496
I know about
your health condition, Bill.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.237
What?

26:27.281 --> 26:31.328
Now, I-I-I took an oath,
and I would never break my oath,

26:31.372 --> 26:35.985
but I am Chief of the most
prestigious hospital

26:36.029 --> 26:40.207
in the Pacific Northwest,
and information finds me.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.732
And I know that you've been
having health problems.

26:45.429 --> 26:48.781
And if the courts had
the information that I do,

26:48.824 --> 26:52.436
none of this would even be
a conversation.

26:52.480 --> 26:56.919
And even if by some miracle
the courts were fine with it,

26:56.963 --> 27:00.357
you both know that it would
physically be too much.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.146
Which is why
you came here today --

27:06.189 --> 27:09.149
to act like you were
doing us a favor

27:09.192 --> 27:12.935
saying she can be
with us full-time,

27:12.979 --> 27:16.243
all while trying
to carve out some equation

27:16.286 --> 27:19.159
where you -- you have her
for all the magic,

27:19.202 --> 27:21.988
and we're functioning
as glorified nannies.

27:24.077 --> 27:27.123
Hey, tell me if I've got
any of this wrong.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.605
You have.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.306
It's my heart.

27:47.361 --> 27:49.145
I'm so sorry, I-Ifeya.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.799
I d--
I didn't realize...

27:50.843 --> 27:53.410
I suffered a heart attack
recently.

27:53.454 --> 27:56.805
I have a pacemaker now
that they're still adjusting.

27:56.849 --> 28:01.114
It's just really
hard to keep up

28:01.157 --> 28:02.985
with a toddler with that.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.031
It's hard keeping up
with a toddler without one.

28:05.074 --> 28:08.208
I mean, we -- we understand
how frightened you must be.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.252
I...

28:10.514 --> 28:14.867
W-We understand
you want to be there

28:14.910 --> 28:19.045
for every single one
of Pru's celebrations.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.047
And -- And we think
you should be.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.745
We want you to be.
We just --

28:23.789 --> 28:25.181
We'd just like
to be there, too.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.098
You know, I can get you
an appointment

28:29.142 --> 28:30.709
with Dr. Maggie Pierce.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.494
She's our best
cardiac surgeon.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.235
Y-You'll be
in good hands.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.846
Thank you.
Yeah.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.635
She should be with you.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.028
It's what's best
for her.

28:48.161 --> 28:50.859
Uh, we do have one
final request, however.

28:50.903 --> 28:52.295
Anything.

28:52.339 --> 28:56.865
Uh, Pru lost her father
to a fire.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.649
He died on the job.

28:58.693 --> 29:01.478
She cannot lose
another father that way.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.697
Ifeya --

29:02.741 --> 29:04.960
I-I couldn't save my son,

29:05.004 --> 29:09.748
but if I can spare
his daughter's heart,

29:09.791 --> 29:13.099
it's my job, as someone
who cares about her, to try.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.386
Hold this.
Hold this on your...

29:39.429 --> 29:41.605
Stella!
Stella!

29:41.649 --> 29:44.391
Oh, my God.
- What happened?
- Oh, baby, is that you?!

29:44.434 --> 29:46.393
It looks like the sugar
burned her eyes.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.221
She couldn't see where she was
going and she got trapped.

29:48.264 --> 29:51.180
It was everywhere.
The air was like lightning.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.616
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.488
I'm okay, baby.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.490
- We're okay.
- I love you.

29:56.533 --> 29:57.970
I love you both.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.107
Ricky, where'd you go?

30:05.151 --> 30:07.153
Right here.

30:07.196 --> 30:08.719
Let's get married, baby.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.811
Okay, sir, we really need
to get her to the hospital.

30:12.854 --> 30:13.942
Would you like
to ride with her?

30:13.986 --> 30:16.336
Yes! Sorry, sorry.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.207
Baby,
I'm right beside you.

30:18.251 --> 30:21.167
Hell yeah.
Let's get married!

30:21.210 --> 30:23.822
Okay, we gotta go.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.791
- Sorry about 23.
- Hmm.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.053
Thanks.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.142
How'd it go with Ross?

30:40.186 --> 30:42.362
She do you better
than us?

30:42.405 --> 30:44.190
We have
a lot to drink about.

30:44.233 --> 30:46.801
- Hmm.
- Thanks for the save,
Herrera.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.803
Yeah, what happened
in there?

30:48.847 --> 30:51.066
Beckett read the map
he was given upside down.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.287
What?
Mm-hmm.

30:56.158 --> 30:57.768
Wow.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.335
"Wow," yeah.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.514
So, how you doing?
You okay?

31:04.558 --> 31:06.908
Not really.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.518
Hmm?

31:08.562 --> 31:12.261
It's not <i>not</i> my fault
23 got shut down.

31:12.305 --> 31:16.265
I-I mean,
these guys, they're --

31:16.309 --> 31:18.877
they're boneheads, but they're
damn good firefighters.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.704
Most of them.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.924
And I failed
as their leader.

31:22.968 --> 31:25.231
I-I saw an opportunity
to go back to 19,

31:25.274 --> 31:28.060
and I sank them
in the process.

31:28.103 --> 31:31.063
If my dad saw me now...

31:32.673 --> 31:35.284
I know the feeling.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.546
You think you're doing
the right thing,

31:36.590 --> 31:38.548
but then it ends up...

31:38.592 --> 31:41.116
costing someone their job.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.466
Look, you're an excellent
leader, Andy.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.077
Just, um...

31:45.120 --> 31:47.296
Just learn from it.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.038
I did.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.224
Movement.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.660
Hold right edge.
Re-engage.

32:03.704 --> 32:06.054
Spotters up.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.708
Clear shot.
Now or never.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.776
I lied.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.082
I don't want to be
a Marine forever.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.518
I want to paint,
and I want to travel,

32:35.562 --> 32:37.085
and I want to learn
to cook French food,

32:37.129 --> 32:38.608
but I can't do any of that
until we finish this --

32:38.652 --> 32:39.696
till this is over.

32:39.740 --> 32:40.784
Do you understand me?

32:42.308 --> 32:44.919
Then take the shot
and end this, Sullivan.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.405
Sullivan!

32:56.539 --> 32:59.020
I'm calling in
a drone strike.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.369
Equinox,
this is Thunder Spade.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.893
We have a situation.
Target is not viable.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.721
Requesting --

33:10.466 --> 33:13.165
Scratch that, Equinox.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.949
Ready for extraction.

33:20.607 --> 33:22.913
Hey, you might want to clear
your lockers, B-shift.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.046
Herrera's
got us shut down.

33:27.831 --> 33:29.007
Captain Herrera.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.140
You taught me a lot,

33:32.184 --> 33:35.883
and you saved my ass
more than once.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.104
I'd follow you
into any fire.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.589
Alright, listen up.

33:46.633 --> 33:50.158
Look, every single one of you
has proven time and time again

33:50.202 --> 33:52.682
what amazing
firefighters you are.

33:52.726 --> 33:55.555
Budget cuts can't take away
what you've done for this city

33:55.598 --> 33:57.339
and for this community.

33:57.383 --> 34:01.300
Look, Station 23
has a long history

34:01.343 --> 34:03.867
of legendary firefighters,
and you all are

34:03.911 --> 34:07.306
and always will be
part of that history.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.569
I mean, come on.
You're the last of the legends.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.313
So take what you've accomplished
here into the world

34:14.356 --> 34:17.272
and go make it less crappy.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.493
You're all gonna land
on your feet.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.625
Well...most of you.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.456
To Captain Herrera,

34:27.500 --> 34:30.851
the last fire captain
of Station 23.

34:30.894 --> 34:33.114
- Yeah, Herrera.
- Captain Herrera!

34:33.158 --> 34:34.463
Captain Herrera!

34:36.378 --> 34:37.510
Herrera!

34:52.090 --> 34:54.179
What's happening here?

34:54.222 --> 34:57.095
I'm trying to remove
the stench of death.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.619
- Bleh.
- You know, we see people
dead and dying every day.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.316
And yet, somehow --That was worse?

35:01.360 --> 35:03.492
That was...not something

35:03.536 --> 35:06.191
humans are meant to see
or smell.

35:06.234 --> 35:07.931
Only the worms
and maggots and stuff

35:07.975 --> 35:10.586
are supposed
to see that.
Hmm.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.372
Seeing that poor man,
who died alone

35:13.415 --> 35:15.809
with no one to even notice
he was gone --

35:15.852 --> 35:18.507
Made you grateful
for me?

35:18.551 --> 35:22.163
It made me realize that...

35:22.207 --> 35:24.948
I don't think
I ever really loved Emmett.

35:24.992 --> 35:27.516
I mean, I think...
I liked him a lot.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.605
I liked being
around him.

35:30.954 --> 35:35.524
But mostly, I just...
didn't want to be alone.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.135
So I told him
what he wanted to hear

35:37.178 --> 35:39.572
because it was easier
than hurting him --

35:39.615 --> 35:44.707
which, in a way,
kind of makes me the one

35:44.751 --> 35:46.231
that was acting
like my dad.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.539
Oh --
Hey!

35:50.583 --> 35:52.150
Oh, my --
Oh, my --

35:52.193 --> 35:54.326
Hey.

35:54.369 --> 35:55.196
Oh.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.159
Ugh.

36:02.334 --> 36:05.728
Sorry, sorry.
That was --

36:05.772 --> 36:07.208
I just really wanted
to do that yesterday...
Yep.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.428
...when I saw you.

36:09.471 --> 36:12.561
You know, if you want to work
at 19, it's totally fine.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.476
I don't really think
that's up to me.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.216
Oh.
But thank you.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.304
Okay.

36:18.393 --> 36:19.568
Hey, man!

36:19.612 --> 36:21.048
Hey.

36:21.091 --> 36:22.484
Yep.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.574
No, take it off!
Take it off!

36:25.618 --> 36:26.793
No.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.534
No. No.

36:30.231 --> 36:33.495
Ooh! Ooh!

36:38.848 --> 36:40.633
Hey.
Hey.

36:40.676 --> 36:43.157
Um...I-I couldn't sleep

36:43.201 --> 36:45.594
'cause all I could see
was Alan's bloated body.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.248
And, uh --

36:47.292 --> 36:49.381
Look, I-I know I said that
I didn't want to talk to you

36:49.424 --> 36:51.861
and that I-I didn't think
you loved me, but, Trav,

36:51.905 --> 36:53.428
that was stupid.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.300
That was unfair, and I think
we should be together.

36:55.343 --> 36:58.825
I think we're great together,
and I know you love me, Trav.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.088
This life is -- is --
it's too damn short

37:01.131 --> 37:03.221
to be this complicated,
so can we just pretend

37:03.264 --> 37:05.223
like all of that
never happened?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.789
I forgive you.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.530
I-I really,
really forgive you.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.760
We got exactly
what we wanted.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.109
And yet...

37:22.152 --> 37:24.459
And yet.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.766
What are you gonna do?

37:26.809 --> 37:29.899
I don't know.
I-I don't know.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.945
But, uh, you realize
you broke HIPAA

37:31.988 --> 37:33.251
with the Millers
yesterday?

37:33.294 --> 37:35.557
Nope.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.385
I was fully bluffing.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.084
I just took what the nanny said
and ran with it.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.915
Oh, I married
an evil genius.

37:45.959 --> 37:47.656
I don't know
what came over me.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.485
I mean, I know exactly
what she's going through,

37:50.529 --> 37:52.357
and I still
went after her.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.315
Yeah, well, you did what you had
to for your family, you know?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.578
And I love you for it.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.101
So does your resident,
apparently.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.538
- I'm sorry.
- Stop!

37:59.581 --> 38:01.931
I'm sorry. Come on.
It's too easy.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.514
Ta-da.

38:19.558 --> 38:23.562
I told you last night
that the Chief said no.

38:23.605 --> 38:27.174
I know, but I had already
chilled the champagne,

38:27.217 --> 38:29.568
so I decided
we're still celebrating.

38:29.611 --> 38:30.960
There are so many things
to celebrate.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.745
I can't.

38:32.788 --> 38:35.400
I'm

38:35.443 --> 38:38.577
angry and frustrated,
and I need to throw things

38:38.620 --> 38:40.361
and get this
out of my system.

38:40.405 --> 38:45.192
And I can't do that when you are
being kind and supportive,

38:45.235 --> 38:49.196
so please just let me
be pissed for a little bit.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.373
Okay.

38:54.070 --> 38:55.376
I still love you,

38:55.420 --> 38:57.987
and we're still
making a baby, okay?

38:58.031 --> 39:01.208
I just...need
to get this out first.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.254
I know war changes you,
but...

39:49.430 --> 39:52.520
...I didn't think
it would change me this much.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.349
You haven't changed
that much.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.483
You're still a guy who won't
kill a man in front of his kids.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.789
I don't think that merits
a celebration.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.272
You still see the human
in your scope.

40:05.315 --> 40:07.448
That matters.

40:27.076 --> 40:28.556
You're still afraid
- to cross that line.
- It's messy.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.124
It -- I...

40:31.167 --> 40:33.474
If I die out there
and if it --

40:33.518 --> 40:36.477
if you die out there,
what will ha--
If you die...

40:36.521 --> 40:38.305
I'll grieve.

40:38.348 --> 40:39.437
If I die,
you'll grieve.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.264
We are close.

40:41.308 --> 40:44.267
We care already.

40:44.311 --> 40:46.313
We already care
too much.

40:48.097 --> 40:50.360
We are already
over the line.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.278
Can we just enjoy it?

41:11.164 --> 41:13.949
Lieutenant Sullivan,
- Station 19.
- Lieutenant Sullivan.

41:13.993 --> 41:14.994
- Yeah, good to see you again.
- Yeah.

41:15.037 --> 41:16.604
How can I help you?

41:16.648 --> 41:18.301
I am afraid it's a bit
of a delicate matter.

41:18.345 --> 41:20.390
Alright.

41:20.434 --> 41:23.350
I know you're closing houses,
consolidating staffs,

41:23.393 --> 41:24.569
but I think you should know
that as you look

41:24.612 --> 41:26.353
at your leadership
and decide what to do

41:26.396 --> 41:28.573
with Herrera, Aquino,
and Bishop,

41:28.616 --> 41:31.010
that, um, Beckett has
a drinking problem.

41:33.578 --> 41:36.189
Look, I don't know for sure
if he's drinking at work,

41:36.232 --> 41:38.931
but he's keeping booze
hidden in drawers,

41:38.974 --> 41:41.194
so I'd bet money
he is.

41:41.237 --> 41:43.849
He's getting sloppy,
and he doesn't want to get help,

41:43.892 --> 41:46.808
so it's just a matter of time
before he gets someone killed.

41:46.852 --> 41:49.202
Have you talked to him
about this?
I have done
everything I can.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.552
And it's complicated,
because he knows we --

41:51.596 --> 41:54.207
well, he suspects
we have history.

41:55.469 --> 41:58.167
But he's putting
my team at risk,

41:58.211 --> 41:59.734
so I'm letting you know.

41:59.778 --> 42:01.344
You know if I get into it,
there's no half-measure

42:01.388 --> 42:03.303
for something like this
in this department, right?

42:03.346 --> 42:05.131
I'm aware.

42:05.174 --> 42:08.221
Alright.

42:08.264 --> 42:09.788
Thanks for letting me know,
Lieutenant.
