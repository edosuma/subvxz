05:52.560 --> 05:54.771
-My brother. You all right?
-Yeah, I'm doing good.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.147
How's your family, good?

05:56.230 --> 05:58.066
-It's gonna be a battle. I know.
-I know it.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.068
-I knew that coming in.
-Okay.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.448
Let's give 'em something to boo about.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.947
Control the boards. We gotta have
everybody come in and rebound.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.491
Mike, this kid's got a hot hand right now.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.982
<i>You said Saturday's loss was just</i>
<i>a bump in the road.</i>

12:13.524 --> 12:15.484
<i>What about this game?</i>
<i>Where do you go from here?</i>

13:19.548 --> 13:22.676
What's the biggest motivating factor
going into that series for you?

13:54.959 --> 13:58.546
This team likes to run, they need to get
easy baskets for them to score.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.381
They gotta get 100 points.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.259
Remember, this team is second
in the league in scoring.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.844
They have a pretty potent offense
when they run.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.175
Did you ever discuss your fathers?

28:45.849 --> 28:48.351
What kind of attention did you get
from college scouts

28:48.435 --> 28:50.103
when you were coming out of high school?

30:33.790 --> 30:37.252
What do you remember
about that day in 1984?

38:08.160 --> 38:10.788
It's bigger than just being
knocked out of the playoffs.

38:10.871 --> 38:12.957
It's the end of an era.

41:00.458 --> 41:03.043
Yeah. The chemo, I can't hear real well,
so you gotta...

41:56.805 --> 41:58.140
For the time being anyway.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.282
Nut crunchin' time.

42:18.452 --> 42:21.163
Some can... some can't.

42:23.290 --> 42:25.042
That's the way it look like to me.

42:25.125 --> 42:26.794
Some can, some can't?

42:27.461 --> 42:29.213
Some can, some can't.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.384
That's just the way it is.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.888
-You stay away from Scott Burrell.
-I...

42:37.972 --> 42:39.848
You're not instructed
to talk to Scott Burrell.

42:39.932 --> 42:41.475
You'll scare the shit out of him.

43:04.039 --> 43:06.709
All right, there's no tomorrow.
Let's go out and do it.

43:06.792 --> 43:08.794
Let's leave everything
on this fucking floor.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.412
And you guys, you can switch
on this thing if you need to.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.372
I'm not switching, Phil. I won't do it.

45:08.455 --> 45:10.290
I'm chasing.
I'm not switching nothing off.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.187
Enjoy yourself, dog.

48:19.938 --> 48:21.398
You bitch, fuck you.

48:21.481 --> 48:24.860
-Y'all gave us a run for our money.
-Yeah. I'll see ya.

48:24.943 --> 48:27.946
All right, take care. Now you can
work on that golf game of yours.
