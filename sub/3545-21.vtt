00:00.166 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.083 --> 00:03.208
I left Morty.

00:03.291 --> 00:06.250
<i>Susan's mother made</i>
<i>quite an impression.</i>

00:06.333 --> 00:08.041
<i>Bree made a secret commitment.</i>

00:08.125 --> 00:12.125
- He's not gonna let us be friends.
- Who says he has to know?

00:12.208 --> 00:14.500
<i>Gabrielle made a discovery.</i>

00:14.583 --> 00:16.667
I am pregnant and it's all your fault.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.917
<i>Tom made a mistake.</i>

00:19.000 --> 00:22.083
You hire your old girlfriend
and you don't tell me?

00:22.166 --> 00:24.208
<i>And Susan made an appointment...</i>

00:24.291 --> 00:26.667
- Do you think you can help?
<i>- ...with trouble.</i>

00:26.750 --> 00:28.875
I know I can.

00:31.208 --> 00:36.208
<i>When she was younger, Sophie Bremmer</i>
<i>was a hopeless romantic.</i>

00:36.291 --> 00:39.625
<i>She was also hopelessly naive,</i>

00:39.709 --> 00:43.417
<i>which is how</i>
<i>she came to be married four times.</i>

00:43.500 --> 00:48.375
<i>The first time</i>
<i>to a man who liked to gamble.</i>

00:48.458 --> 00:52.792
<i>The second time</i>
<i>to a man who liked to drink.</i>

00:52.875 --> 00:57.625
<i>The third time</i>
<i>to a man who liked other men.</i>

00:57.709 --> 01:04.083
<i>And the fourth time to the same man</i>
<i>she married the second time.</i>

01:05.458 --> 01:09.625
<i>Yes, Sophie was tired</i>
<i>of having her heart broken.</i>

01:09.709 --> 01:14.333
<i>So she decided</i>
<i>she would never get married again.</i>

01:15.000 --> 01:17.250
<i>And then one night...</i>

01:17.333 --> 01:20.625
- Sophie.
<i>- ...she had a visitor.</i>

01:20.709 --> 01:23.709
Sophie.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.792
Morty, what are you doing?

01:25.875 --> 01:28.875
I need to talk to Sophie.

01:28.959 --> 01:31.291
Now? Are you drunk?

01:31.375 --> 01:34.625
Just a little.

01:34.709 --> 01:37.250
How are you, Susie?

01:39.875 --> 01:43.291
I've got to speak to Sophie.

01:43.375 --> 01:46.083
Are you crazy?
It's 1:00 in the morning.

01:46.166 --> 01:48.834
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

01:48.917 --> 01:52.083
- What?
- Well, I thought I could be happy.

01:52.166 --> 01:55.000
The restaurant
is starting to make money.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.792
I just bought a new jet ski.

01:57.875 --> 02:00.458
My cholesterol is down.

02:00.542 --> 02:05.458
But none of it's any fun without her.

02:07.583 --> 02:10.667
Morty. I just don't think
it's going to happen.

02:10.750 --> 02:15.625
She's moved on. Why don't you just
sit down? I'm gonna call you a cab.

02:18.083 --> 02:22.083
- Sophie.
- Your doctor told you not to drink.

02:22.166 --> 02:26.709
Well, there are times
when you need...

02:26.792 --> 02:29.333
when you need liquid courage.

02:40.667 --> 02:43.333
Did this ring belong to Dolores?

02:43.417 --> 02:45.625
You gave her your dead wife's ring?

02:45.709 --> 02:52.291
It's a three-carat diamond.
She shouldn't care if it's used.

02:53.750 --> 02:55.750
So what do you say, Soph?

02:55.834 --> 02:57.583
- All right.
- Really?

02:57.667 --> 02:59.834
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:00.875 --> 03:05.291
But no. You've got to
do it officially. You know.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.458
Yeah. Here.

03:17.375 --> 03:22.291
Sophie, would you do me the honor
of marrying me?

03:22.375 --> 03:26.875
<i>Sophie Bremmer</i>
<i>was still a hopeless romantic.</i>

03:26.959 --> 03:32.875
On one condition. Tomorrow
we trade this in for a ring of my own.

03:32.959 --> 03:36.041
And I want a bigger diamond
than Dolores got.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.000
<i>But she was no longer naive.</i>

04:25.875 --> 04:29.250
<i>Marriage is a simple concept.</i>

04:29.333 --> 04:33.166
<i>Basically, it's a contract</i>
<i>between two people</i>

04:33.250 --> 04:36.959
<i>that binds them together for life</i>

04:37.041 --> 04:40.709
<i>in the hopes that</i>
<i>they can live happily ever after.</i>

04:41.959 --> 04:46.458
<i>Sadly, some contracts</i>
<i>are made to be broken.</i>

04:46.542 --> 04:49.667
- I didn't mess with your birth control.
- Really?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.583
Really.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.792
Look. It's been pulled apart
and put back together.

04:58.875 --> 05:02.917
- It's probably a manufacturing defect.
- You can still see the glue marks.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.208
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.

05:05.291 --> 05:07.083
Don't insult me, Carlos.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.709
You've been whining about
wanting a baby for months.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.166
Who else would it have been?

05:11.250 --> 05:12.500
I don't...

05:14.166 --> 05:16.417
- Oh, no.
- What?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.625
- Mama.
- Please.

05:18.709 --> 05:23.458
It's possible. You buy that stuff
in bulk, six months at a time, right?

05:23.542 --> 05:24.834
Yeah. So?

05:24.917 --> 05:28.500
Before the accident, I told her
how much I wanted to have a child.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.000
She said that she would take care of it.

05:31.083 --> 05:34.333
I just thought that
she would talk to you.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.875
Baby, I am so sorry.

05:43.417 --> 05:46.250
That bitch.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.166
I can't believe her.

05:48.250 --> 05:51.709
I loved her
but even I had issues sometimes.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.500
She could be very controlling.

05:53.583 --> 05:56.500
Reaching out from the grave
to screw with me.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.583
God, she's good.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.458
Where are you going?

06:04.542 --> 06:06.875
I feel a wave of
morning sickness coming on.

06:06.959 --> 06:10.875
I want to be standing
on your mother's grave when it hits.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.583
I'm gonna be home late tonight.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.208
Peterson wants to
take us out for drinks.

06:23.291 --> 06:26.000
That's fine.

06:26.083 --> 06:29.000
I wanted to talk to you about something.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.000
What?

06:31.083 --> 06:33.083
That's your car pool.

06:33.166 --> 06:34.625
You gotta go. Never mind.

06:34.709 --> 06:37.583
- Lynette, what is it?
- It's nothing.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.542
OK.

06:39.625 --> 06:42.333
It's just...

06:45.375 --> 06:49.542
...we haven't had sex in ten days. The
longest we've ever gone before is nine.

06:49.625 --> 06:53.000
Didn't we do it last Thursday?

06:53.083 --> 06:57.542
We started to but then you fell asleep.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.458
Is this why you're so worried?
We can do it tonight if you want to.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.500
- Whatever.
- No, I've got ten days pent up in me.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.417
We are doing it tonight.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.792
You have nothing to worry about, OK?

07:10.875 --> 07:12.917
Crap. I forgot my briefcase.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.959
Can you tell them I'll be right there?

07:15.041 --> 07:16.375
Sure.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.792
Hey, Lynette.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.208
- Hey.
- So is Tom almost ready?

07:24.291 --> 07:26.375
Yeah, he's just getting his briefcase.

07:27.625 --> 07:28.625
Sorry.

07:28.709 --> 07:29.834
It's OK.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.083
See you, honey.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.250
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.250
I got it.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.583
Thank you for having me.

07:58.542 --> 08:00.917
I'm gonna miss you both so much.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.166
Us too. The house will feel
just empty without you.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.208
- Can't you guys stay a little longer?
- No.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.458
They wanna get their new life started.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.917
We don't wanna
hold these crazy kids back.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.667
Bye, Morty.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.375
Listen, I hope it's OK

08:19.458 --> 08:25.041
but your mom told me some of the stuff
that you've been going through,

08:25.125 --> 08:29.375
you know, with the plumber guy
across the street.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.333
- She did?
- Yeah.

08:31.417 --> 08:33.375
Don't give up on him.

08:33.458 --> 08:38.500
I mean, if I'd given up, I wouldn't be
here now with this lovely lady.

08:38.583 --> 08:42.792
Did she tell you that he served time
in prison for manslaughter?

08:42.875 --> 08:46.458
No, she left that part out.

08:47.583 --> 08:50.458
I don't suppose she told you
he was a drug dealer.

08:50.542 --> 08:53.500
I don't recall that.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.542
Will you stop?
You don't know the whole story.

08:56.625 --> 09:00.417
- Mother.
- I told him how much you love him.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.625
What? What were you thinking?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.125
- What did he say?
- Yeah, what did he say?

09:05.208 --> 09:08.458
I think I walked in on him
at a very bad time.

09:08.542 --> 09:12.041
Someone close to him had just died.

09:12.125 --> 09:16.625
- God. Really?
- He could use a shoulder to cry on.

09:18.041 --> 09:22.125
Can I have one more hug?
Please. I can't stand it.

09:37.417 --> 09:40.667
George. You have got to taste this.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.917
- A little messy but...
- I can't wait.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.000
Is that fennel seed? It's fantastic.

09:48.083 --> 09:51.417
I don't know, but anything that good
has got to be sinful.

09:52.458 --> 09:56.458
Isn't this fun trying different dishes
and opening up to new experiences?

09:56.542 --> 09:58.542
Rex just hates these cooks tours.

09:58.625 --> 10:03.417
He likes to stay at home with a plate
of spaghetti and a mug of root beer.

10:08.291 --> 10:12.291
So how about this marinara sauce?
I think it's the best I've ever had.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.709
I had one better but that was in Italy.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.917
You've been to Italy?

10:18.000 --> 10:22.792
Rex and I took a vacation there
right before the kids were born.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.917
We had so much fun
in those first few years.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.750
Guess it was just easier
to be happy back then.

10:35.166 --> 10:39.083
I don't know why I just said that.
No more wine for me.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.792
Maybe we should go to Italy.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.667
- What?
- Wouldn't that be a hoot?

10:47.750 --> 10:50.709
All those museums and cathedrals
and trattorias.

10:50.792 --> 10:54.959
- We could just make pigs of ourselves.
- I can't go on a trip with you, George.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.291
Why not?

10:57.375 --> 10:59.667
I'm married. People would talk.

10:59.750 --> 11:03.000
- Right. I'm sorry. It was a bad idea.
- Don't worry about it.

11:03.083 --> 11:07.792
Here. Try one of these clams. I bet
they're as good as the marinara sauce.

11:19.917 --> 11:23.208
You are absolutely right.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.709
If it's that good,
it's just got to be sinful.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.333
OK, boys. It's 7:00.

11:39.417 --> 11:43.834
- It's time for bed. Let's go.
- Why do we have to go to bed so early?

11:43.917 --> 11:47.250
I told you. Daddy and I
have a special meeting tonight.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.125
Go on.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.000
I love you.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.125
Hi.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.625
I'm sorry.

12:05.709 --> 12:10.542
Hi. All right.
This is the tenth day.

12:10.625 --> 12:14.041
Honey, give me a second
to let the office wear off.

12:14.125 --> 12:16.166
- OK.
- OK, I'm in.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.709
What are you thinking?

12:28.750 --> 12:31.417
I was wondering what that smell was.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.208
It's probably baby drool.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.750
There. Now you have easier access.

12:38.834 --> 12:41.291
Incoming.

12:45.959 --> 12:50.458
- What?
- That smell really soaked through.

12:50.542 --> 12:54.750
Yes. It soaked through a little.
That is the nature of baby throw-up.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.125
Do you want me to wear a Hazmat suit?

12:57.208 --> 13:01.625
No, I just like it when you're
all clean and in your sexy clothes.

13:01.709 --> 13:06.625
I don't own anything clean and sexy.

13:06.709 --> 13:11.583
Everything is either covered in
baby spit or chunks of melted crayon.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.792
OK, I'm sorry.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.625
You make me feel like
I just got off the shrimp boat.

13:15.709 --> 13:17.792
Honey, I said I'm sorry.

13:17.875 --> 13:21.375
It's just that guys
sometimes like it when women,

13:21.458 --> 13:23.917
you know,
put a little effort into things.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.125
OK.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.375
Can we just go back to
the kissing thing? Can we try that.

13:34.458 --> 13:37.208
Fine.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.917
- OK. Off.
- The baby's up.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.375
Mom.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.625
Mom.

13:48.125 --> 13:53.041
- Susan Mayer hired you?
- I know.

13:53.125 --> 13:57.208
She decided to stop poking around
in your life and call me of all people.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.500
Lucky for you, I've got
the biggest ad in the phone book.

14:03.959 --> 14:05.667
- What am I going to do?
- Run.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.333
- Pack up your kid and leave.
- That's tricky.

14:08.417 --> 14:11.000
My son doesn't want to move.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.500
He can be pretty insistent.

14:14.583 --> 14:18.291
Well, I can throw her off the scent
for a while.

14:19.458 --> 14:23.083
- Fine.
- All right then.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.375
Tell me exactly what it is
you want this woman to believe.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.500
She was born Angela,

14:29.583 --> 14:32.875
but when she was a teenager
she changed her name to Mary Alice.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.250
The application says

14:35.333 --> 14:39.083
that she was named after
a relative that she no longer speaks to.

14:39.166 --> 14:42.375
Now, here's her birth certificate

14:43.417 --> 14:47.333
and her Utah petition
for a legal name change.

14:49.583 --> 14:54.208
- What about Dana?
- There was a record of another child.

14:54.291 --> 14:57.166
A girl. Dana Marie Young.

14:57.250 --> 15:01.166
Died at 18 months,
apparently from some kind of fall.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.333
It was all true. Everything he said.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.375
How could I have been so wrong?

15:12.458 --> 15:17.417
- Well, I'm gonna need a check.
- Of course.

15:25.917 --> 15:31.000
Actually, before you go, I need you to
check into someone else's background.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.375
There's this plumber I know.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.750
Hey. Did you get my messages?

15:44.834 --> 15:48.458
Yeah, I didn't want to call you 'cause
I wanted to talk to you in person.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.792
I have some potentially upsetting news.

15:51.875 --> 15:56.250
Come on, Mrs. Solis.
You can tell me. I can handle it.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.250
I'm pregnant and it might be yours.

16:10.583 --> 16:14.834
I could barely afford my new dirt bike.
How am I gonna handle child support?

16:14.917 --> 16:17.458
We don't know for sure
if it's yours, so relax.

16:17.542 --> 16:20.709
- I didn't come to watch you freak out.
- Why did you come?

16:20.792 --> 16:23.583
- Cos I want you to let me protect you.
- From who?

16:23.667 --> 16:26.166
Carlos, your parents.

16:26.250 --> 16:29.542
John, something like this
can ruin your life.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.417
That's why you have to keep quiet
about our affair.

16:32.500 --> 16:36.667
There's no point in this catastrophe
taking both of us down.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.875
- Thank you.
- Forget about it.

16:44.750 --> 16:50.291
- I should have worn a condom.
- Yeah. That would have been helpful.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.917
You hired a private investigator?

16:56.000 --> 16:59.375
I can't trust Mike and I want
to find out what really happened.

16:59.458 --> 17:02.375
From a source
that doesn't have an agenda.

17:02.458 --> 17:05.000
Now open it up.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.375
OK. You ready?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.750
Go.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.667
- Stop.
- What?

17:12.750 --> 17:17.875
OK. If you find out
something that's really bad,

17:17.959 --> 17:20.959
just try to put a positive spin on it.

17:28.959 --> 17:31.417
OK.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.041
I have some good news
and some bad news.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.667
Give me the bad news first.

17:37.792 --> 17:41.333
The guy Mike killed was a cop.

17:41.417 --> 17:43.166
My God.

17:47.333 --> 17:50.500
OK. Give me the good news.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.792
- There is none.
- What?

17:52.875 --> 17:54.792
You told me to spin it.

17:54.875 --> 17:58.333
Forget it.
Just let me look at it myself.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.959
- I can't believe it.
- What is it?

18:16.041 --> 18:18.625
I know her.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.375
What's going on here?

18:44.834 --> 18:47.041
You two just won't stop, will you?

18:47.125 --> 18:50.458
Deidre's dead.
It doesn't matter who killed her.

18:50.542 --> 18:53.709
- Just let it go.
- It's not that easy, Kendra.

18:53.792 --> 18:57.166
Why? My sister hated you. Both of you.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.000
- She said so.
- That was the drugs talking.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.959
Right. The drugs.

19:03.041 --> 19:07.000
Deidre humiliated this family and
she threw our love back in our faces.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.834
She couldn't have cared less.

19:08.917 --> 19:10.959
- Are you done?
- No.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.250
I want to know what you're planning.

19:15.250 --> 19:19.041
- We're just talking.
- I don't believe you.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.291
Then don't ask.

19:30.375 --> 19:34.417
I don't want a new cardiologist but
Lee's been conducting tests for weeks.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.542
He should know what's wrong by now.

19:36.625 --> 19:39.875
Honey, we socialize with them.
What am I going to say to Helen?

19:39.959 --> 19:43.917
All I know is, I've never felt worse,
and I've got to do something.

19:46.125 --> 19:49.875
I have to talk to Edie.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.208
Bree, we're gonna be late.

19:52.291 --> 19:56.250
It'll just take a second.
I need to get a recipe.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.709
- Edie. Hi.
- Hi.

19:58.792 --> 20:02.542
- I saw you at Fredo's yesterday.
- Yeah, I saw you, too.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.542
Naughty.

20:04.625 --> 20:07.166
- I beg your pardon?
- The guy.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.875
The one you were spoon-feeding.

20:09.959 --> 20:14.917
Not bad. A little petit for my taste,
but I'm not the one sleeping with him.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.583
This is exactly what I was afraid of.
George and I are just friends.

20:19.667 --> 20:22.083
Hey, I'm not judging you. I get it.

20:22.166 --> 20:26.291
Rex was sticking it to that
hooker housewife. It's payback time.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.750
You have got the wrong idea.
That man is my pharmacist.

20:29.834 --> 20:32.667
You could have an affair with anyone.
A pharmacist?

20:32.750 --> 20:37.750
- You are such a Republican.
- I am not having an affair.

20:37.834 --> 20:40.291
George and I, we just talk.

20:40.375 --> 20:44.959
He's a very good listener and
I share my hopes and dreams with him,

20:45.041 --> 20:47.291
and my innermost thoughts.

20:47.375 --> 20:50.166
That's all there is to it
and you have to believe me.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.917
- OK. I believe you.
- Thank you.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.792
I'm glad we cleared this up.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.625
I know it must have looked strange

20:56.709 --> 21:00.500
and I didn't want you to think
that I was cheating on my husband.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.083
But you sort of are.

21:03.166 --> 21:06.041
- Excuse me?
- Well, come on, Bree.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.834
You're telling him
your innermost thoughts?

21:08.917 --> 21:11.291
Your hopes? Your dreams?

21:11.375 --> 21:15.959
Sex aside, you're pretty intimate
with a guy that's not your husband.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.709
Well, I mean,
everybody needs someone to talk to.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.875
What's wrong with talking to Rex?

21:31.917 --> 21:33.875
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

21:33.959 --> 21:37.917
Hello, Zach? It's Felicia Tillman.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.750
I do so enjoy our little visits

21:40.834 --> 21:42.792
and I haven't seen you for a few days.

21:42.875 --> 21:45.583
<i>I hope everything's all right.</i>

21:47.125 --> 21:50.709
- Zach's not feeling well.
- Paul.

21:50.792 --> 21:54.875
And I don't think it's appropriate that
he spends so much time at your house.

22:00.750 --> 22:04.583
Made us some cocoa.
How are you feeling?

22:04.667 --> 22:07.500
I've felt awful for two days now.

22:09.417 --> 22:11.667
Think I should see a doctor?

22:11.750 --> 22:15.959
It's probably just a touch of the flu.
We'll keep an eye on it.

22:18.291 --> 22:21.125
It's this house, Zach. I feel it too.

22:21.208 --> 22:23.625
It isn't healthy for us to stay here.

22:23.709 --> 22:27.458
I told you. I'm not moving.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.250
It would be for your own good.

22:29.333 --> 22:32.959
You can't keep doing
the kinds of things you're doing.

22:33.041 --> 22:37.333
Susan Mayer's kitchen, for example.
People are going to catch on.

22:39.959 --> 22:43.250
Wouldn't it be great to start over
somewhere in the country?

22:43.333 --> 22:47.000
Could meet some new friends.
Maybe even meet a new girl.

22:49.041 --> 22:51.709
How about I let you sleep on it?

22:53.834 --> 22:56.250
We'll talk about moving tomorrow.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.792
<i>The lack of passion in her marriage</i>

22:59.875 --> 23:03.208
<i>had become an unpleasant reality</i>
<i>for Lynette.</i>

23:04.917 --> 23:07.250
<i>Then one day it occurred to her,</i>

23:07.333 --> 23:09.667
<i>the best way to fight reality...</i>

23:12.125 --> 23:14.667
<i>...was with a little fantasy.</i>

23:17.000 --> 23:21.792
<i>Of course, all the fantasy</i>
<i>in the world won't do you any good...</i>

23:23.875 --> 23:26.500
<i>...if no one shows up to enjoy it.</i>

23:47.291 --> 23:49.792
I feel bad about
putting you out like this, Tom.

23:49.875 --> 23:53.083
You're not putting anybody out.
You've been flying all day.

23:53.166 --> 23:55.250
Why stay in some hotel?

23:55.333 --> 23:58.375
I just hope you don't mind
sleeping on the sofa.

24:00.250 --> 24:03.291
Yeah. Sofa should be fine.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.875
Hey, honey. Why don't you
just let the maid get that?

24:17.959 --> 24:20.709
Not funny, Tom.

24:20.792 --> 24:25.583
Gary's showering. He asked if you could
bring him a towel and your riding crop.

24:27.792 --> 24:28.792
Come on.

24:28.875 --> 24:32.041
No, I'm glad that you find
my humiliation so entertaining.

24:32.125 --> 24:35.458
Honey, you were wearing
a French maid's costume.

24:35.542 --> 24:38.834
I mean, come on. What were you thinking?

24:38.917 --> 24:43.583
That our marriage was in trouble
and one of us should try and save it.

24:45.291 --> 24:48.166
Since when is our marriage in trouble?

24:49.667 --> 24:53.625
OK, so we haven't had sex
for a few days. Big deal. It happens.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.333
That's Annabel. How ironic.

24:59.375 --> 25:02.000
How is Annabel relevant
to this conversation?

25:02.083 --> 25:06.291
Because she comes to this house every
morning to remind you of what I'm not.

25:06.375 --> 25:09.041
- What?
- She's the fantasy, Tom.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.500
The hot woman
that you work with every day

25:11.583 --> 25:14.625
with her manicured nails
and her designer outfits.

25:14.709 --> 25:18.375
I am the reality.

25:18.458 --> 25:23.125
The wife who never wears makeup
and whose clothes smell like a hamper.

25:23.959 --> 25:27.333
OK, this may be the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.500
I used to be the fantasy.

25:29.583 --> 25:33.542
There was a time
when I didn't need a maid's outfit

25:33.625 --> 25:36.083
because I knew I was enough for you.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.625
Even wearing a smelly T-shirt.

25:39.542 --> 25:43.667
And clearly, that's no longer the case.

25:45.375 --> 25:47.875
OK, honey, I don't know what to say.

25:47.959 --> 25:50.959
If there's a way for me to fix this,
I will do it.

25:51.041 --> 25:55.333
- Just tell me and I will do it.
- No, there's nothing to fix.

25:55.417 --> 25:57.542
We've changed. That's all I'm saying.

26:03.125 --> 26:05.500
You ready?

26:07.333 --> 26:10.625
You should go.
You don't want to keep Annabel waiting.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.917
Be careful with that.
You'll give the baby heartburn.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.792
I can't get it hot enough.
My hormones are killing my taste buds.

26:26.875 --> 26:30.709
You've been paying more attention
to your food than you have to me.

26:30.792 --> 26:34.208
I plan on getting really fat
as a tribute to your mother.

26:49.834 --> 26:51.542
John, what are you doing here?

26:51.625 --> 26:55.458
- I've been thinking about the baby.
- Really? Why?

26:55.542 --> 26:58.959
There's a chance that it's mine.
I want to do the right thing.

26:59.041 --> 27:03.125
No. Nobody expects you
to do the right thing.

27:03.208 --> 27:07.500
I figured you'd try to blow me off.
That's why I'm going to Mr. Solis.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.834
Are you crazy? He would kill us both.

27:09.917 --> 27:12.166
He and I need to hash this out.
Man to man.

27:12.250 --> 27:15.834
- It's what's best for the baby.
- John.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.750
Are you gonna go get him or am I?

27:21.375 --> 27:23.709
OK. You win.

27:26.417 --> 27:29.542
Wait right here.

27:42.625 --> 27:45.834
- Don't get out.
- Why?

27:46.834 --> 27:50.166
Because I was going to get in.

27:50.250 --> 27:54.959
Yeah. You see, pregnant women
have very strong urges.

27:55.041 --> 27:58.458
All right.

27:58.542 --> 28:01.500
I'm gonna freshen up
and I'll be right back.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.458
- OK.
- You sit.

28:04.542 --> 28:08.792
Sit. I'm turning on some music.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.750
Carlos is unavailable at the moment.

28:23.166 --> 28:25.417
- You're lying.
- John, what are you doing?

28:25.500 --> 28:28.500
- Mr. Solis, open up.
- Stop it.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.500
What are you doing? John.

28:34.583 --> 28:37.375
- Mrs. Solis, get out of the way.
- What are you doing?

28:37.458 --> 28:39.041
No.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.083
My God.

28:45.166 --> 28:48.458
- God, it burns.
- I'm sorry. It's just salsa.

28:48.542 --> 28:51.542
- It feels like acid.
- I've been finding it so bland.

28:51.625 --> 28:55.375
- Mr. Solis. I need to talk to you.
- John, shut up.

28:55.458 --> 28:58.000
John, shut the hell up. Listen to me.

28:58.083 --> 29:01.667
You are never gonna be
the father of this baby.

29:01.750 --> 29:05.709
No matter what the paternity tests say,
it's Carlos' child.

29:05.792 --> 29:09.250
- How can you say that?
- Because Carlos can provide, John.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.917
He will give this baby everything.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.250
Piano lessons and summer camp
and the best colleges.

29:16.333 --> 29:20.834
He can raise this child the way a child
deserves to be raised. You can't.

29:20.917 --> 29:24.542
This isn't about money.
This is about what's best for the baby.

29:24.625 --> 29:28.166
If you want what's best for the baby,
then you will help me.

29:28.250 --> 29:32.583
Help me make sure this kid
does not grow up poor like I did.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.959
What's taking you.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.709
Hey, John.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.709
What are you doing here?

29:42.125 --> 29:44.125
He...

29:44.208 --> 29:46.834
Justin thinks
the hydrangeas need replacing.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.583
He wanted me to come by
for a second opinion.

29:49.667 --> 29:52.834
He's a good kid,
but he's not half the gardener you were.

29:52.917 --> 29:56.583
You should come back and work for us.
You're practically family.

29:59.959 --> 30:02.250
Thanks, Mr. Solis.

30:28.750 --> 30:31.083
Zach? Are you here?

31:00.667 --> 31:04.625
I have to do this, dear.
I know you'll forgive me.

31:21.166 --> 31:22.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:22.834 --> 31:25.542
- Are the boys asleep?
- Tucked in tight.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.959
- And Penny?
- Sound asleep.

31:30.709 --> 31:35.000
OK, when this thing goes off,
meet me in the bedroom.

31:35.083 --> 31:39.125
- What are you... What is this?
- Wait till it goes off.

31:44.792 --> 31:49.041
All right. I'm coming in.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.583
My God.

32:00.250 --> 32:03.792
You want fantasy? I give you fantasy.

32:05.458 --> 32:08.166
Come to me, woman,
and prepare to be boarded.

32:08.250 --> 32:11.792
Please, will you make it fast?
These things are just chafing.

32:11.875 --> 32:14.750
I kinda like it.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.291
Good. Kill the lights.

32:20.375 --> 32:22.583
- No.
- Please.

32:22.667 --> 32:24.750
- Not turning off the lights.
- Please.

32:24.834 --> 32:27.291
No.

32:33.375 --> 32:36.875
It's open.

32:36.917 --> 32:41.834
Paul, it's you. I'm so glad. I have
some papers I want you to look at.

32:41.917 --> 32:44.333
- Where's my son?
- Upstairs.

32:44.417 --> 32:47.709
Sleeping off those tranquilizers
you gave him.

32:47.792 --> 32:50.583
I don't know what you're doing
but I'm taking my son.

32:50.667 --> 32:54.250
I am not my sister, Paul.
You do not want to screw with me.

32:57.792 --> 33:00.500
Martha kept a journal.

33:00.583 --> 33:07.458
Every drab event of her drab life
meticulously documented.

33:07.542 --> 33:13.083
Including her discovery
that you and your wife stole a baby.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.166
A baby named Dana.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.875
I'm sorry if the copies
are hard to read.

33:26.959 --> 33:29.375
I hid the originals in a safe place.

33:29.458 --> 33:33.500
It seemed like a reasonable precaution,
since you murdered Martha and all.

33:35.250 --> 33:37.917
Would you like a cookie?

33:41.250 --> 33:43.083
Suit yourself.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.417
I have a little proposition for you.

33:46.500 --> 33:50.792
These are the fantasies of a bored,
lonely woman. They prove nothing.

33:50.875 --> 33:53.542
The only reason
the police haven't caught you yet

33:53.625 --> 33:56.291
is because they have
no reason to suspect you.

33:58.792 --> 34:05.250
But once they found that Martha was
blackmailing Ange... sorry, Mary Alice.

34:05.333 --> 34:08.709
- What is it you want?
- The same thing you want.

34:09.542 --> 34:12.750
For you to leave town, change your name,

34:12.834 --> 34:16.834
and start your life over again
somewhere far away from here.

34:18.709 --> 34:21.625
If you're so sure,
why don't you just turn me in?

34:21.709 --> 34:24.333
Because Zach would never forgive me.

34:24.417 --> 34:28.166
And it's important
that we be on good terms,

34:28.250 --> 34:31.834
seeing as how
he's going to be living with me now.

34:33.041 --> 34:35.834
- What?
- Your bags are packed.

34:36.792 --> 34:40.875
You're about to become a fugitive.
Is that the life you want for your son?

34:40.959 --> 34:44.375
The two of you spending every night
in a different town?

34:46.250 --> 34:49.709
No. You're a better father than that.

34:51.583 --> 34:54.125
I can't just leave him.

35:00.250 --> 35:03.875
You stole him
so that he could have a better life.

35:03.959 --> 35:07.750
That was a noble act, Paul. Truly.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.250
And it's time for you to be noble again.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
Can I at least say goodbye?

35:19.083 --> 35:22.375
Did you allow me
to say goodbye to Martha?

35:54.917 --> 35:58.375
Hi. I'm looking for Kendra Taylor.

35:58.458 --> 36:00.583
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave.

36:00.667 --> 36:03.417
You don't understand.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.917
See, I can't just drive away.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.792
- Please get back in the car.
- Look Bob.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.500
- Let me try to explain.
- In the car.

36:12.583 --> 36:15.208
See, the thing is,
this is maybe my last chance

36:15.291 --> 36:17.500
to find out
if I can be with the man I love.

36:17.583 --> 36:19.208
- Ma'am.
- And, Bob,

36:19.291 --> 36:21.959
I can't begin to tell you
how much that means to me.

36:22.041 --> 36:27.166
So I'm gonna walk up to that house
and you're gonna let me.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.333
And you know why?

36:29.417 --> 36:36.208
Because behind that badge and that big,
you-could-crush-me-like-a-fly chest,

36:36.291 --> 36:38.083
there's a heart.

36:38.166 --> 36:42.125
A heart that believes in love.

36:46.375 --> 36:50.834
- Just get in the damn car.
- It's not my fault you don't have love.

36:52.792 --> 36:57.166
- Susan?
- Hi, Kendra.

36:57.250 --> 37:00.792
And despite all that's been
laid out in front of me,

37:00.875 --> 37:03.458
I can't help thinking
there's more to the story.

37:03.583 --> 37:07.083
- Does it sound stupid?
- No, no, of course not.

37:07.166 --> 37:11.959
Unfortunately,
you've got the whole story right here.

37:12.041 --> 37:14.542
But Mike's lawyer pleaded self-defense.

37:14.625 --> 37:18.166
Delfino sold black-tar heroin
to my daughter.

37:18.250 --> 37:22.417
He killed the cop that tried to bust
him, got convicted and did his time.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.208
- End of story.
- Dad.

37:24.291 --> 37:28.125
She deserves to hear the truth,
however awful.

37:29.709 --> 37:32.709
I'm sorry, Miss Mayer. I really am.

37:35.792 --> 37:38.917
I appreciate you talking to me.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.834
What the hell was that?

37:45.917 --> 37:48.875
If she knew the truth,
she'd go running back to him.

37:50.375 --> 37:53.250
She might talk him out of doing his job.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.667
I can't risk that.

37:58.125 --> 38:00.500
Just don't have the time.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.291
Quick. Drive around the corner.
We need to talk.

38:19.458 --> 38:22.166
What do you think?
I chose green so it will work

38:22.250 --> 38:25.208
whether Gabrielle has a boy or a girl.

38:25.291 --> 38:27.250
That's great.

38:28.166 --> 38:31.166
What's the matter?
You've been mopey all day.

38:31.250 --> 38:35.250
I'm sorry.
I'm just worried about the test results.

38:35.333 --> 38:38.458
If I don't find out what's wrong
with me, I'll lose my mind.

38:38.542 --> 38:41.709
- Honey.
- You must get tired of me complaining.

38:41.792 --> 38:44.125
No, not at all.

38:44.208 --> 38:46.458
I think we should talk about it.

38:46.542 --> 38:50.250
In fact,
I think maybe we don't talk enough.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.083
I guess.

38:54.583 --> 38:58.625
Why don't we start doing things
together again as a couple?

39:03.000 --> 39:06.709
As soon as you're well enough,
we should go on a vacation.

39:06.792 --> 39:09.125
Take a trip. Go somewhere fun.

39:11.333 --> 39:14.458
- Remember our trip to Italy?
- Sort of.

39:15.542 --> 39:17.917
Sort of?

39:18.000 --> 39:21.917
You don't remember the glorious food
and the gorgeous scenery and...

39:22.000 --> 39:24.208
What I remember is sweating like a pig

39:24.291 --> 39:26.959
and wishing we hadn't
spent all our savings.

39:30.208 --> 39:32.959
So where would you like to go?

39:40.208 --> 39:44.000
It doesn't matter. You decide.

39:50.166 --> 39:52.500
Mike wasn't a drug dealer.

39:53.750 --> 39:56.542
- What?
- Deidre was.

39:56.625 --> 39:59.917
Mike, he kicked the habit early on.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.375
But Deidre couldn't or didn't want to.
I don't know.

40:04.458 --> 40:08.834
Anyway, she spiraled out of control
and was in and out of jail.

40:08.917 --> 40:11.959
One day an undercover cop
caught her using.

40:12.041 --> 40:15.250
He forced her to trade sex for freedom.

40:16.750 --> 40:21.959
Mike found out about it
and he tried to put a stop to it.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.875
He busted in on the two of them.

40:25.917 --> 40:31.000
He... Well, the cop pulled a gun on him
and Mike fought him off,

40:31.083 --> 40:34.125
but they both went over the balcony.

40:34.208 --> 40:37.000
Mike was the only one that got back up.

40:42.208 --> 40:44.917
It was self-defense.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.041
Yeah.

40:50.125 --> 40:53.583
Mike went to jail
trying to save my sister.

40:54.542 --> 40:56.667
But he couldn't.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.083
I knew he was good.

41:05.417 --> 41:07.083
I just knew it.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.959
Thank you.

41:19.291 --> 41:21.667
<i>The vow is simple, really.</i>

41:24.125 --> 41:29.208
<i>Those who take it promise to stay</i>
<i>together for better or for worse,</i>

41:30.333 --> 41:32.709
<i>for richer or for poorer,</i>

41:34.917 --> 41:37.917
<i>in sickness and in health.</i>

41:40.166 --> 41:42.959
<i>To honor and to cherish.</i>

41:45.583 --> 41:48.709
<i>Forsaking all others.</i>

41:54.709 --> 41:57.583
<i>Until death do us part.</i>

42:05.375 --> 42:09.083
<i>Yes, the vow is simple.</i>

42:09.166 --> 42:13.750
<i>Finding someone worthy</i>
<i>of such a promise is the hard part.</i>

42:15.041 --> 42:16.834

42:16.917 --> 42:21.542
<i>that's when we begin to live</i>
