00:16.183 --> 00:17.250
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.951
Take the day off.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.586
Thank you.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.553
All right.

02:42.748 --> 02:46.384
So what did you do?

02:46.452 --> 02:47.386
You figured out I was in jail,

02:47.387 --> 02:48.854
but you don't know why?

02:48.921 --> 02:51.690
<i>I've been busy.</i>

02:51.758 --> 02:53.091
Excessive prescribing.

02:53.159 --> 02:54.960
Not that busy.

02:55.028 --> 02:57.863
<i>I know that you pled down</i>
<i>to excessive prescribing,</i>

02:57.931 --> 03:00.933
but the question was
"what did you do?"

03:04.738 --> 03:08.041
36-year-old, non-smoking
junior high science teacher

03:08.109 --> 03:09.944
started coughing blood
in the middle of homeroom.

03:12.114 --> 03:12.914
<i>House says he's gonna be out</i>

03:12.982 --> 03:14.716
for the next three days.

03:14.784 --> 03:16.084
<i>Sweet. If I go straight to the airport,</i>

03:16.152 --> 03:17.753
<i>I can make Cabo</i>
<i>for the last call.</i>

03:17.820 --> 03:20.121
Um, he also said to call him
if we find a case.

03:20.189 --> 03:21.623
Which we didn't.
<i>What do you call this?</i>

03:21.691 --> 03:22.857
<i>Could be a case. Could be nothing.</i>

03:22.925 --> 03:25.493
Sadly, we'll just never know.

03:25.561 --> 03:26.627
<i>He's coughing blood.</i>

03:26.695 --> 03:27.761
A lot of people are.

03:27.829 --> 03:29.096
Right now I have
to get to Vernon

03:29.163 --> 03:30.664
while there's still enough
powder to ski on.

03:30.731 --> 03:32.832
This is where a lesser man

03:32.900 --> 03:34.100
would make
a black-guy-skiing joke.

03:34.168 --> 03:38.070
You owe me a body shot.

03:38.138 --> 03:40.473
Make it fast.
I'm driving.

03:40.541 --> 03:44.910
I don't want to end up
in jail like...

03:44.978 --> 03:48.281
A person should who used their
phone illegally while driving.

03:48.348 --> 03:50.717
36-year-old male with hemoptysis,

03:50.785 --> 03:51.918
headaches, chills,
and chest pain.

03:51.986 --> 03:53.620
Where are you?

03:53.688 --> 03:55.155
On my way to the greater
Schenectady chili cook-off

03:55.223 --> 03:56.290
and spud gun competition.

03:56.358 --> 03:59.127
That's your honeymoon?

03:59.195 --> 04:01.095
Nope, Dominika went to A.C.
with her boyfriend.

04:01.163 --> 04:02.964
E.R. ruled out bronchitis,

04:03.031 --> 04:04.065
pneumonia, and lung cancer.

04:04.132 --> 04:06.467
So diagnosis...boring.
It's epistaxis.

04:06.534 --> 04:07.601
<i>It's a nosebleed.</i>

04:07.669 --> 04:09.136
<i>Blood runs into his lungs,</i>

04:09.204 --> 04:10.237
he coughs it back up,

04:10.305 --> 04:11.338
flu explains the rest
of the symptoms.

04:11.406 --> 04:13.273
Going once, going twice...

04:13.341 --> 04:15.509
Toxic exposure
to ammonia or sulfites

04:15.577 --> 04:17.144
can traumatize the lungs,

04:17.211 --> 04:19.279
cause neuralgias or fevers.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.781
<i>Fits better because</i>
<i>of his radiating chest pain.</i>

04:20.849 --> 04:24.017
Sold. To Masters.

04:24.085 --> 04:25.185
Do a home search for toxins.

04:25.253 --> 04:30.058
Draw cultures
for bacteria and fungi.

04:30.125 --> 04:31.626
You're married?

04:31.694 --> 04:34.863
You were gone so long.

04:34.930 --> 04:38.700
Green card.

04:38.768 --> 04:40.001
Thanks for not saying anything.

04:40.069 --> 04:41.002
I just need some time to...

04:41.070 --> 04:42.838
I didn't do it for you.

04:42.905 --> 04:47.241
Some puzzles are just
too good to share.

04:47.309 --> 04:48.543
This is my exit.

04:55.951 --> 04:57.117
Chili?

04:57.185 --> 04:59.954
I hate chili.
Love spud guns.

05:04.259 --> 05:06.260
You get nosebleeds?

05:06.328 --> 05:07.794
Yeah, yeah.

05:07.862 --> 05:09.029
You think that's where
the blood came from?

05:09.097 --> 05:11.665
I don't just think it.
I hope it.

05:11.732 --> 05:12.966
When was the last time
it happened?

05:13.034 --> 05:14.134
At the quarterfinals.

05:14.202 --> 05:16.469
I coach volleyball,
and during warm-ups

05:16.537 --> 05:19.806
I got hit in the nose
a few months ago.

05:21.976 --> 05:23.910
You coach volleyball in a gym?

05:23.978 --> 05:25.245
Yes.

05:25.312 --> 05:26.746
With showers?
<i>Yes.</i>

05:26.814 --> 05:28.882
Clean showers?
<i>Not particularly.</i>

05:28.949 --> 05:30.417
The blood you were
coughing up wasn't blood.

05:30.485 --> 05:33.520
<i>Dirty gym washroom means</i>
<i>serratia infection.</i>

05:33.588 --> 05:34.855
Your lungs are full
of red bacteria.

05:34.923 --> 05:37.958
You were right.
That was an interesting case.

05:38.026 --> 05:39.426
<i>You start him on Levaquin.</i>

05:39.494 --> 05:41.728
I'll start looking
for my good flip-flops.

05:49.870 --> 05:52.205
Think that might be blood.

05:54.776 --> 05:56.810
What's this really all about, House?

05:56.878 --> 05:59.046
As convincing as I find
your deep devotion

05:59.113 --> 06:00.180
to vegetable trajectory.

06:00.248 --> 06:01.681
First of all, it's a tuber.

06:01.749 --> 06:04.618
And you're just jealous because
your potato-related plans

06:04.686 --> 06:08.322
are more of the serving
up fries variety.

06:08.390 --> 06:11.258
You did time.

06:11.326 --> 06:12.893
Means your license
is suspended.

06:12.961 --> 06:14.528
Which means your
leave of absence

06:14.596 --> 06:16.931
is definitely indefinite.

06:16.998 --> 06:21.969
What exactly
are you going back to?

06:22.037 --> 06:24.138
I'd only have to serve up fries

06:24.206 --> 06:25.639
until
the medical board hearing.

06:25.707 --> 06:27.841
I stand corrected.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.778
You obviously have a rich,
full life waiting for you.

06:30.845 --> 06:33.914
I'll slow down the car
and you can roll out.

06:33.982 --> 06:37.317
I don't even have
a change of clothes.

06:37.385 --> 06:41.588
Damn. If only
I'd planned for that.

06:50.999 --> 06:53.133
Okay, here's what I got.

06:53.201 --> 06:55.435
One, you were in jail
for six months,

06:55.503 --> 06:57.137
but you were gone about a year,

06:57.205 --> 06:58.038
which means that when you left

06:58.106 --> 06:59.340
you hadn't been arrested.

06:59.407 --> 07:02.176
Two, you enjoy being known
as a number.

07:02.243 --> 07:04.444
You don't want people
to know the real you,

07:04.512 --> 07:06.279
because you think
the real you is weak.

07:06.347 --> 07:10.850
You were running...

07:10.917 --> 07:13.352
A bleeding-heart medical
consulting business

07:13.420 --> 07:17.489
for illegals, or some other
sympathetic under-class.

07:17.557 --> 07:18.490
No.

07:18.558 --> 07:20.259
Over-class?

07:20.327 --> 07:21.527
This interrogation thing
is getting annoying.

07:21.595 --> 07:23.529
Studies have shown
that un-annoying interrogation

07:23.597 --> 07:25.031
is 50% less effective.

07:25.099 --> 07:27.500
Why are you so determined
to bring me to this competition?

07:27.568 --> 07:28.569
Why don't you bring Wilson?

07:28.636 --> 07:30.304
Wilson thinks it's stupid.

07:30.372 --> 07:33.274
<i>I</i> think it's stupid.

07:33.342 --> 07:35.543
Junior year of high school,

07:35.611 --> 07:38.346
you placed fourth
in a West Virginia

07:38.414 --> 07:40.081
all-county science fair.

07:40.149 --> 07:43.718
Your project, clean combustion.

07:43.786 --> 07:45.453
<i>Yeah, I also</i>
<i>wore a training bra.</i>

07:45.521 --> 07:46.488
<i>Things have changed.</i>

07:46.555 --> 07:48.756
Not that much.

07:48.824 --> 07:51.592
I've been going to this contest
for four years.

07:51.660 --> 07:53.861
For four years I've come second

07:53.929 --> 07:58.465
to a pissant named Harold Lam.

08:00.468 --> 08:02.402
This is serious?

08:03.538 --> 08:04.772
Second.

08:08.576 --> 08:10.243
Okay.

08:10.311 --> 08:11.311
I can help you,

08:11.379 --> 08:12.646
<i>but I'm going to need</i>

08:12.713 --> 08:13.980
<i>to make a personal stop</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

08:14.048 --> 08:14.982
What kind of stop?

08:15.049 --> 08:16.550
Personal.

08:16.617 --> 08:20.387
Did I not mention that?

08:20.454 --> 08:21.588
You gonna tell me
where you were last night?

08:21.656 --> 08:23.490
I ran into a friend.

08:23.558 --> 08:25.659
We had 50 bucks on the Bulls.

08:25.726 --> 08:26.726
<i>I had to eat a large pizza</i>
<i>by myself.</i>

08:26.794 --> 08:28.728
You missed me.

08:28.796 --> 08:30.730
Not as much as I miss my $50.

08:35.702 --> 08:36.635
Where'd you meet her?

08:36.703 --> 08:38.236
At the hospital.

08:38.304 --> 08:39.572
If it's Masters,
just lie to me.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.941
Oh.
It's the new CNA

08:42.009 --> 08:43.477
<i>on the third floor.</i>

08:43.544 --> 08:45.646
The redhead.
She's hot.

08:45.713 --> 08:47.681
And I'm seeing her again
tomorrow night.

08:47.749 --> 08:49.750
I don't know how you do it.

08:49.818 --> 08:51.886
Is it the cute, harmless vibe,

08:51.953 --> 08:54.489
the self-deprecating humor,
or just straight-up roofies?

08:54.557 --> 08:56.257
If you're interested,

08:56.325 --> 08:57.726
I do seminars.

09:17.772 --> 09:19.973
No electric, no gas either.

09:20.012 --> 09:21.346
It's cold in here.

09:21.414 --> 09:23.148
The good thing is I found a guy

09:23.216 --> 09:24.617
who makes you look
like a good roommate.

09:26.219 --> 09:27.953
Maybe hoarding's a symptom.

09:28.021 --> 09:29.621
<i>Could be caused by brain injury</i>

09:29.689 --> 09:32.557
<i>or early-onset Alzheimer's.</i>

09:32.625 --> 09:33.691
<i>It's most likely that it's psychological.</i>

09:33.759 --> 09:35.693
As to what's making him
cough blood,

09:35.761 --> 09:37.228
dealer's choice.

09:37.296 --> 09:38.763
<i>Declutter your home.</i>

09:38.831 --> 09:40.631
The hoarder's handbook.

09:40.699 --> 09:41.866
<i>He's hoarding books</i>
<i>on hoarding.</i>

09:41.933 --> 09:45.436
Ugh.

09:45.503 --> 09:46.637
He doesn't have running water.

09:46.705 --> 09:48.906
How does this guy live,

09:48.973 --> 09:51.041
let alone make it to work every
day and teach a bunch of kids?

09:51.109 --> 09:54.345
Fridge is on. He's hooked it up
to a neighbor or something.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.550
Cat.

10:02.789 --> 10:04.523
I might have to throw up.

10:04.591 --> 10:06.525
He'll want to keep that too.

10:11.131 --> 10:13.133
Aspergillosis.

10:13.201 --> 10:14.901
Explains the coughing blood,

10:14.969 --> 10:17.137
and if he's formed
small aspergillomas,

10:17.205 --> 10:18.172
it could explain the headache
and chest pain.

10:18.239 --> 10:20.541
I'll be in the car.

10:24.446 --> 10:29.783
Okay, turn right.

10:29.851 --> 10:31.318
You were writing
bogus prescriptions

10:31.386 --> 10:34.154
for medical marijuana.

10:34.222 --> 10:37.857
Please say no
because you have to be an idiot

10:37.925 --> 10:38.959
to actually screw that up.

10:39.027 --> 10:41.094
No.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.430
I mean, I was,
but I didn't get caught.

10:43.498 --> 10:47.134
I have to admit, you have
one of the best game faces

10:47.201 --> 10:49.702
I've ever seen.

10:49.770 --> 10:51.538
Also one
of the best game bodies.

10:51.606 --> 10:53.807
Pull over.

10:55.843 --> 10:58.611
Hang on a second.

11:43.027 --> 11:44.895
Didn't know you were
a Jehovah's Witness.

11:44.962 --> 11:47.297
Yeah, the weak lost faith
when Christ didn't return

11:47.365 --> 11:52.636
in '75, but I still believe.

11:52.704 --> 11:55.505
You're really not gonna tell me
what just happened?

11:55.573 --> 11:59.709
I don't know about you,
but I am starving.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.290
You broke into my home?

12:14.358 --> 12:17.827
We slowly pushed
into your home.

12:17.895 --> 12:20.063
So what did you find?

12:20.131 --> 12:21.632
A compost heap in your fridge.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.901
We think
you have aspergillosis.

12:23.969 --> 12:25.703
It's treatable
with antifungals.

12:25.771 --> 12:27.538
You do remarkably well
for living...

12:27.606 --> 12:29.540
Like you live.

12:29.608 --> 12:32.209
I use bottled water
and flashlights.

12:32.277 --> 12:33.977
It's like camping.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.880
Fun.

12:36.947 --> 12:38.014
We're also gonna need
a psych consult.

12:38.082 --> 12:39.649
I'm not a hoarder.

12:39.717 --> 12:44.187
I'm just a major slob.

12:44.254 --> 12:46.789
You save earwax.

12:51.863 --> 12:54.465
You know,
I'm actually kind of hurt

12:54.533 --> 12:55.866
that you don't know what I did.

12:55.934 --> 12:58.036
I'm not worth bribing
a court official

12:58.103 --> 13:00.005
or hacking into police records?

13:00.073 --> 13:01.506
Where's the fun in that?

13:01.574 --> 13:05.911
You could have at least hired
Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

13:05.979 --> 13:08.514
Lucas?
Mm-hmm.

13:08.582 --> 13:10.382
You don't know?

13:10.450 --> 13:12.985
What, is he dead or something?

13:13.053 --> 13:14.686
No.

13:16.823 --> 13:19.057
Actually, until
a couple of weeks ago,

13:19.125 --> 13:21.159
I was Cuddy's weird boyfriend.

13:22.628 --> 13:25.429
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that.

13:35.508 --> 13:40.113
Are...are you okay?

13:40.181 --> 13:43.350
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:43.418 --> 13:47.655
It's not a big deal.

13:54.530 --> 13:57.464
I killed a man.

14:12.046 --> 14:13.613
Psych eval gave us nothing.

14:13.684 --> 14:14.918
So our patient
is just an average Joe

14:14.985 --> 14:17.187
with a two-foot pile
of used q-tips?

14:17.255 --> 14:18.755
Whatever he is,
he doesn't have aspergillosis.

14:18.823 --> 14:21.024
Pain's intensified,
and now he needs oxygen.

14:21.092 --> 14:22.692
There's got to be all kinds
of toxins in that place.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.227
Exposure issues
don't make sense.

14:24.295 --> 14:25.362
He's been here a full day.
He'd be getting better,

14:25.429 --> 14:26.730
not worse.

14:26.798 --> 14:29.699
Unless exposure was keeping him
from getting worse.

14:29.767 --> 14:31.034
<i>The gas was off</i> <i>at his place.</i>

14:31.102 --> 14:32.302
<i>How does he stay warm?</i>
Portable heater?

14:32.370 --> 14:33.938
Or portable gas heater,

14:34.005 --> 14:35.539
which emits carbon monoxide.

14:35.607 --> 14:37.042
Which is a vasodilator.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.477
The low-grade exposure
was actually improving

14:39.545 --> 14:40.712
<i>his lung capacity.</i>

14:40.780 --> 14:41.847
<i>We bring him here,</i>
<i>he gets worse.</i>

14:41.915 --> 14:42.948
If we're right,
don't need House,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.183
and we still get two days off.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.017
<i>We still have to prove it.</i>

14:45.085 --> 14:46.319
Someone's got to go back

14:46.386 --> 14:49.388
into that place
and test for C.O.

14:49.455 --> 14:50.889
Chase and I can go.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.092
It's only fair.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.660
Fairness is important.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.536
<i>You're awfully quiet.</i>

15:06.604 --> 15:07.837
Sorry.
That's just how I get

15:07.905 --> 15:09.506
around people
who have recently killed a man.

15:09.573 --> 15:12.775
It wasn't...

15:12.843 --> 15:14.344
You know, I've had
a pretty rough year.

15:14.411 --> 15:15.779
Do you think maybe we could just
give this whole thing a rest?

15:15.847 --> 15:19.682
You killed a man.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.952
But you pled out to drugs.

15:22.019 --> 15:24.754
<i>Hit-and-run</i>
<i>under the influence.</i>

15:24.821 --> 15:27.257
Guy you kneed in the groin
was your date

15:27.324 --> 15:28.558
who dropped a dime on you.

15:28.626 --> 15:30.293
I'm asking you to let it go.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.628
And I really wish
I was the kind of person

15:31.695 --> 15:32.862
who could do that.

15:43.674 --> 15:45.074
Ruby, right?

15:45.142 --> 15:47.343
Yeah.

15:47.411 --> 15:48.778
Hey, how are you liking PPTH?

15:48.846 --> 15:50.647
It's great.
Everyone's so friendly.

15:50.715 --> 15:52.983
Yeah.
Especially Dr. Taub.

15:53.050 --> 15:55.018
<i>Don't worry.</i>

15:55.086 --> 15:56.754
I'm not gonna bust your chops.

15:56.821 --> 15:58.889
<i>I just want to know one thing.</i>

15:58.957 --> 16:00.958
How did he get you
to go out with him?

16:01.026 --> 16:03.494
Why?
Is...is there something...

16:03.562 --> 16:05.229
No, no, no, no,
he's...he's great.

16:05.297 --> 16:06.730
I'm...you know,
I'm just asking

16:06.798 --> 16:08.866
because...

16:10.535 --> 16:13.605
Well, he's...

16:15.641 --> 16:16.942
Um...

16:17.009 --> 16:18.410
You know what, never mind.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.744
It's none of my business.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.079
You guys have fun tonight.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.246
I'm not seeing him tonight.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.215
We had plans, but he canceled.

16:24.282 --> 16:27.618
Dr. Stern to Radiology.
Dr. Stern to Radiology.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.704
<i>This thing's got no fuel valve.</i>

16:45.772 --> 16:48.006
<i>Means you can't regulate</i>
<i>the input.</i>

16:48.074 --> 16:50.909
And what is this?
A barbecue lighter?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.717
Your gun sucks.

17:07.059 --> 17:10.529
We should treat this
like an archaeological dig.

17:10.596 --> 17:12.931
Grid the site, excavate,

17:12.999 --> 17:14.098
catalog, analyze.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.402
You like it here.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.470
You don't think
this is fascinating?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.839
Not nearly as fascinating
as the fact

17:20.907 --> 17:23.175
that you think
it's fascinating.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.143
But this guy kept everything

17:24.211 --> 17:25.979
he ever came into contact with.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.047
An interactive life history.

17:28.115 --> 17:31.317
It's an indiscriminate pile
of rubbish.

17:31.385 --> 17:33.853
Well, for the most part,

17:33.921 --> 17:35.721
so are our lives.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.026
There's no carbon monoxide.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.729
<i>A bit of a blow to Foreman's</i>
<i>exposure hypothesis</i>

17:42.796 --> 17:44.230
and my plan to get out
of here quickly.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.368
<i>Maybe we don't just figure out</i>
<i>the what,</i>

17:48.436 --> 17:50.871
we figure out the why.

17:50.938 --> 17:52.472
Then maybe...

17:52.540 --> 17:54.708
From the size
and the undigested seeds,

17:54.776 --> 17:57.611
<i>I'm guessing this came</i>
<i>from a raccoon.</i>

17:57.679 --> 17:59.146
If you're thinking Q fever,

17:59.214 --> 18:00.949
it fits.

18:01.016 --> 18:02.984
<i>So why are you still looking?</i>

18:03.052 --> 18:05.186
Well, you only found one thing.

18:05.254 --> 18:06.521
<i>It fits perfectly.</i>

18:06.589 --> 18:09.089
<i>Yeah, but that doesn't mean...</i>

18:10.225 --> 18:12.093
Chase.

18:31.724 --> 18:33.558
You missed something
at his place.

18:34.555 --> 18:36.089
His wife.

18:36.165 --> 18:37.032
Nina.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.334
I didn't know where you were.

18:38.402 --> 18:41.538
I'm so sorry.
I couldn't get home.

18:41.606 --> 18:43.240
<i>You okay?</i>

18:43.308 --> 18:44.675
We think you both have Q fever.

18:44.743 --> 18:46.544
Found raccoon feces
in the kitchen cupboard.

18:46.612 --> 18:49.180
We're gonna start you
on Doxycycline.

18:49.248 --> 18:50.915
Why wouldn't you tell us
you're married?

18:50.983 --> 18:52.150
<i>The fewer people who know about her,</i>

18:52.218 --> 18:53.118
<i>the easier it is.</i>

18:53.186 --> 18:54.219
When can I go back?

18:54.287 --> 18:55.587
She gets anxious
when she's away

18:55.655 --> 18:56.721
from her things.

18:56.789 --> 18:57.789
She's the hoarder.
He just lives there.

18:57.856 --> 18:59.424
On purpose?

19:02.360 --> 19:04.461
She's my wife.

19:09.201 --> 19:10.734
How do they not have
1/2-inch drill bits?

19:10.802 --> 19:13.103
By the way, Harold's
probably gonna hit on you.

19:13.171 --> 19:15.038
Everything I have, he wants.

19:15.106 --> 19:17.307
Just turn him down flat.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.142
Unless...
Yes.

19:19.210 --> 19:20.644
Let's stop shopping.

19:20.712 --> 19:22.546
I'll just do him and get him
to throw the contest.

19:22.614 --> 19:25.916
I'm not sugges...

19:25.984 --> 19:27.919
Would you do that?

19:27.987 --> 19:29.587
How's this thing judged?

19:29.655 --> 19:32.457
Hang time, distance,
and accuracy.

19:32.524 --> 19:33.658
Okay, how about this?

19:33.726 --> 19:35.193
<i>You met a guy in a club,</i>

19:35.261 --> 19:37.529
<i>you brought him home,</i>
<i>he O.D.'d,</i>

19:37.596 --> 19:39.264
so the guy now writhing
on his front porch

19:39.331 --> 19:41.700
was the dealer who sold you
the faulty goods.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.835
Categories weighted the same?
Yup.

19:43.903 --> 19:45.871
Screw accuracy.
We're gonna double distance

19:45.939 --> 19:47.172
and hang time,
beat Harold on points.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.606
We need raw power.

19:48.674 --> 19:50.509
Where's the fertilizer?

19:50.576 --> 19:52.610
By all means, Kaczynski.

20:07.193 --> 20:08.693
Hi.

20:08.761 --> 20:10.395
You and Taub
sharing phones now?

20:10.462 --> 20:12.263
He's seeing the redhead
on the third floor.

20:12.331 --> 20:13.764
Please tell me
you're not talking

20:13.832 --> 20:15.266
about the hot new CNA
with the dimples.

20:15.334 --> 20:16.468
She confirmed it.

20:16.535 --> 20:17.969
What she didn't confirm

20:18.037 --> 20:19.571
was their date tonight.

20:19.638 --> 20:20.605
He bailed on her.

20:20.672 --> 20:21.872
If he's standing her up,

20:21.940 --> 20:22.940
he must have something better
going on.

20:23.008 --> 20:25.342
Better than sex
with a 22-year-old?

20:25.410 --> 20:27.545
Who's artie92?

20:27.613 --> 20:28.780
Presumably a 21-year-old.

20:28.847 --> 20:29.980
Whoever it is,

20:30.048 --> 20:31.348
Taub's meeting 'em
at my place at 8:00,

20:31.416 --> 20:33.250
which is usually
when I go to the gym.

20:33.318 --> 20:37.421
Guess you'll be missing
spin class.

20:41.626 --> 20:44.294
Okay, contestants, the field
is now open for practice.

20:44.362 --> 20:45.395
You've got one hour.

20:45.463 --> 20:46.697
Have fun.

20:46.764 --> 20:47.965
Schedule 80 PVC
is pressure rated

20:48.032 --> 20:49.366
for 220 psi,

20:49.434 --> 20:50.567
fuel valve 300.

20:50.635 --> 20:53.036
We can easily push it to 250,

20:53.104 --> 20:55.871
have your friend Harold
peeing in his pants.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.026
Damn.

21:15.094 --> 21:19.096
Be cool.

21:31.810 --> 21:33.577
Harold.

21:33.645 --> 21:35.646
House.

21:35.713 --> 21:37.514
You look good.

21:37.582 --> 21:39.350
I like that jacket on you.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.285
Thanks.

21:41.353 --> 21:43.554
You filled out a little.

21:43.622 --> 21:45.257
Who's the babe?

21:48.962 --> 21:51.230
She's the boot in your ass.

21:51.297 --> 21:53.866
<i>Perhaps you've heard</i>
<i>of famed Russian physicist</i>

21:53.934 --> 21:57.936
<i>Olga Petrovich?</i>

21:58.004 --> 22:00.272
Olga Petrovich is 72 years old.

22:00.340 --> 22:04.076
And her granddaughter

22:04.143 --> 22:06.945
works at a little place
called JPL.

22:07.013 --> 22:10.081
I did an internship there
last summer.

22:12.652 --> 22:13.985
She killed a man.

22:16.989 --> 22:18.089
No.

22:18.156 --> 22:19.590
I'm guessing she didn't do it

22:19.658 --> 22:21.459
with a spud gun.

22:21.527 --> 22:24.263
Just a bad combustion valve.

22:28.836 --> 22:31.104
Shut up.

22:41.016 --> 22:42.416
On my sofa.

22:42.484 --> 22:44.385
Oh. Uh.

22:44.453 --> 22:46.821
Hey.

22:49.357 --> 22:51.559
You remember my wife.

22:51.626 --> 22:53.528
Hi, Eric.

22:55.831 --> 23:00.135
Hey, rt92.

23:13.315 --> 23:16.251
I hope you like rhubarb.

23:19.122 --> 23:20.722
We're celebrating.

23:20.790 --> 23:23.592
We're going rogue.

23:23.660 --> 23:25.395
<i>We rip out</i>
<i>the combustion valve,</i>

23:25.462 --> 23:26.696
replace it with disks.

23:26.764 --> 23:28.197
With enough pressure,

23:28.265 --> 23:30.767
<i>it should blow out</i>
<i>at maximum velocity.</i>

23:30.835 --> 23:34.872
Turning the spud into spudnik.

23:34.939 --> 23:36.473
What do we use for disks?

23:36.541 --> 23:37.909
<i>Well, here's a hint.</i>

23:37.976 --> 23:40.278
<i>I actually hate rhubarb.</i>

23:40.345 --> 23:44.015
Pie tins.

23:44.082 --> 23:46.451
You're a genius.

23:50.255 --> 23:51.923
You know that I'm a doctor.

23:51.991 --> 23:53.992
<i>Any interest I have</i>
<i>in the human body</i>

23:54.060 --> 23:55.294
<i>is purely clinical.</i>

23:55.361 --> 23:57.129
Yeah, that line never works
for me either.

23:57.197 --> 23:59.932
That line always works for you.

24:12.814 --> 24:15.083
So what did you do?

24:17.019 --> 24:17.918
No more guessing?

24:17.986 --> 24:20.921
I need to know.

24:26.127 --> 24:28.695
I can make some phone calls,
see if we can speed up

24:28.762 --> 24:30.830
your medical board hearing.

24:30.898 --> 24:33.332
In the meantime,
no one could stop me

24:33.400 --> 24:35.534
from hiring an assistant.

24:46.914 --> 24:49.617
You were right this morning.

24:53.722 --> 24:55.557
I met a guy at a coffee shop,

24:55.625 --> 24:56.959
we went back to my place,

24:57.026 --> 25:02.531
and he O.D.'d.

25:02.599 --> 25:03.799
Damn.

25:03.867 --> 25:07.002
I could have saved myself
a job offer.

25:07.070 --> 25:10.106
We both acted like idiots.

25:10.174 --> 25:14.044
And I ended up doing time.

25:14.111 --> 25:16.947
Guess he did more.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.128
<i>When we first moved into the house,</i>

25:30.196 --> 25:31.729
<i>we had people over</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

25:31.797 --> 25:36.067
Then she started
collecting things.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.969
I figured it was a hobby.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.605
Piles turned into art projects,

25:40.673 --> 25:45.442
and art projects turned
into what you saw.

25:48.546 --> 25:50.714
So why do you stay?

25:50.781 --> 25:56.152
To everyone else,
the world is full of junk...

25:56.220 --> 25:58.956
meaningless, ugly,
broken things.

25:59.023 --> 26:00.691
But to Nina,

26:00.758 --> 26:03.928
every shape,

26:03.996 --> 26:06.497
every color, texture, smell,

26:06.565 --> 26:09.334
they all tell a story.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.604
<i>They're all worth treasuring.</i>

26:12.672 --> 26:13.939
<i>I wouldn't wish what she has</i>
<i>on anyone,</i>

26:14.007 --> 26:16.942
but every now and then
I get a glimpse

26:17.010 --> 26:20.579
of what she sees, and...

26:20.647 --> 26:21.947
It helps.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.524
Your lungs
are clearing up nicely.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.992
Respiratory rate's normal.
Temp's normal.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.827
Looks like you're
gonna be fine.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.300
She okay?

26:43.368 --> 26:45.369
Something's wrong
with her heart.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.658
The husband is fine.
The wife is worse.

27:25.771 --> 27:26.615
<i>She had a heart attack.</i>

27:26.616 --> 27:27.382
<i>Her heart attack could be</i>

27:27.448 --> 27:28.815
from a complication.

27:28.883 --> 27:30.684
Q fever would cause
congestive heart failure,

27:30.752 --> 27:32.987
not myocardial infarction.

27:33.055 --> 27:34.522
<i>So she had Q fever and something else</i>

27:34.589 --> 27:36.190
that causes heart attack?

27:36.258 --> 27:38.093
And the hoarding. Now that
the wife is the only patient,

27:38.160 --> 27:39.327
hoard is back on the board.

27:39.395 --> 27:41.363
Or we were wrong about Q fever.

27:41.430 --> 27:42.764
<i>I don't buy</i>
<i>it's just a coincidence.</i>

27:42.832 --> 27:44.033
<i>It's not a coincidence.</i>

27:44.100 --> 27:45.834
<i>Diagnosis X</i>
<i>caused the hoarding,</i>

27:45.902 --> 27:48.104
which caused the Q fever
when the raccoons came

27:48.172 --> 27:49.672
to spend spring break
at her house.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.441
<i>Now all we have to do</i>
<i>is solve for x.</i>

27:51.508 --> 27:54.310
I remember somebody saying that
hoarding could be a symptom.

27:54.378 --> 27:55.645
<i>We should do an MRI.</i>

27:55.712 --> 27:58.213
Hydrogen sulfide.

27:58.281 --> 28:02.184
<i>It's given off by eggs</i>
<i>and rotting food.</i>

28:02.251 --> 28:04.152
Long-term exposure could cause
the pulmonary issues,

28:04.220 --> 28:05.320
headaches...
<i>Even the heart attack.</i>

28:05.388 --> 28:07.623
Hydrogen sulfide
is also a vasodilator.

28:07.690 --> 28:09.991
<i>Which my crack team</i>
<i>never tested the place for.</i>

28:10.059 --> 28:11.626
Of course, half my crack team

28:11.694 --> 28:13.294
never tested
the place for people.

28:13.362 --> 28:15.029
<i>So we should go back,</i>

28:15.097 --> 28:16.698
check it out.
<i>Might be safer</i>

28:16.765 --> 28:18.433
to just assume we're right
and start treatment.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.533
<i>Go with God.</i>

28:19.601 --> 28:21.669
<i>And some air freshener.</i>

28:21.737 --> 28:23.471
You know, maybe Taub is right,

28:23.539 --> 28:26.375
so I'm gonna stay here with him
and help him with the MRI.

28:38.590 --> 28:39.890
Shine up your spuds, folks.

28:39.958 --> 28:40.925
We're gonna start shooting
for hang time

28:40.993 --> 28:42.627
in just a few minutes.

28:42.695 --> 28:45.363
The wind's coming
from the southeast.

28:45.431 --> 28:47.900
You have to aim five degrees
to the left.

28:47.967 --> 28:49.768
We're gonna break 14 seconds.
I can feel it.

28:49.835 --> 28:52.437
When I was 10 or 11,

28:52.505 --> 28:54.039
my dad used to take us
to this county fair.

28:54.107 --> 28:58.110
And there was this kid...

28:58.178 --> 28:59.678
What?

28:59.745 --> 29:02.681
Who's "us"?

29:02.748 --> 29:04.549
My mom and me.

29:06.585 --> 29:09.320
Your mom who had
advanced stage Huntington's.

29:12.358 --> 29:16.929
You have a sibling
that you've never mentioned.

29:16.997 --> 29:18.364
Why did you slip up now?

29:18.432 --> 29:21.000
Not everything means something.

29:21.068 --> 29:22.402
We're gonna be up soon.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.272
I want to check the pressure.

29:27.242 --> 29:30.311
You don't wake up in the middle
of the night to cry

29:30.379 --> 29:31.746
<i>over a dead stranger.</i>

29:31.813 --> 29:33.714
You don't confess
to killing a man

29:33.782 --> 29:35.116
and then hide the details

29:35.184 --> 29:36.884
unless the details reveal
more about you

29:36.952 --> 29:40.688
than the crime itself.

29:40.756 --> 29:41.890
You pled down to drugs.

29:41.957 --> 29:45.060
You've got
a horrible genetic disease

29:45.127 --> 29:49.364
and a sibling
who's suddenly on your mind.

29:51.501 --> 29:54.436
You euthanized your brother.

29:54.503 --> 29:56.371
And that guy back at the house
was the doctor

29:56.439 --> 30:01.143
who wouldn't help you
cover it up.

30:01.211 --> 30:02.444
The guy back at the house

30:02.512 --> 30:04.046
is my cellmate's boyfriend.

30:04.114 --> 30:07.349
He cheated on her
when she was inside.

30:07.417 --> 30:10.586
But I was right
about everything else.

30:13.022 --> 30:15.257
Congratulations.

30:31.540 --> 30:34.375
You're mad.

30:34.443 --> 30:35.577
No.

30:35.644 --> 30:37.812
Actually, I'm impressed.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.281
Messing around
on a 22-year-old hottie

30:40.349 --> 30:42.416
with your wife on my sofa.

30:42.484 --> 30:44.618
You're a full-throttle
head case.

30:44.686 --> 30:46.153
I was doing you a solid
with the sofa.

30:46.221 --> 30:48.322
Rachel wanted to do it
in your bed.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.357
You've got the memory foam top.

30:50.424 --> 30:52.058
Let's make this really simple:

30:52.126 --> 30:55.829
If I own it, I don't
want you doing it on it.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.064
You might want to get rid
of your kitchen table.

30:59.132 --> 31:01.800
<i>Look, I'm sorry,</i>

31:01.868 --> 31:03.868
<i>but it was worth it.</i>
Yeah, I bet.

31:03.936 --> 31:05.403
<i>You get to mess with her</i>
<i>physically and emotionally.</i>

31:05.471 --> 31:06.871
I still care about her.

31:06.939 --> 31:09.040
Not enough to let her move on
with her life.

31:11.578 --> 31:14.213
<i>While we're talking</i>
<i>about your bad ideas,</i>

31:14.281 --> 31:16.015
MRI's clean.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.417
There has to be some kind

31:18.485 --> 31:21.387
of inciting
psychological incident.

31:21.455 --> 31:23.489
This is perfect for you.

31:23.557 --> 31:26.393
You get all
the human interaction you crave

31:26.461 --> 31:28.328
without any actual
human interaction.

31:28.396 --> 31:30.631
She was a cheerleader.
Huh.

31:30.699 --> 31:31.831
<i>You know when you're interested</i>
<i>in something</i>

31:31.899 --> 31:33.333
and nobody else is,
the polite thing

31:33.401 --> 31:34.834
is to keep it to yourself.

31:34.902 --> 31:36.102
<i>Popular, beautiful,</i>

31:36.170 --> 31:37.570
gregarious.

31:37.637 --> 31:39.705
Hydrogen sulfide's
about two parts per billion.

31:39.773 --> 31:42.174
The size of a healthy fart.

31:45.444 --> 31:49.513
I'll be back for you in July.

32:07.334 --> 32:10.771
He couldn't do it himself.

32:10.838 --> 32:14.375
He was...the disease
had progressed too far.

32:14.442 --> 32:15.809
He was flailing.

32:15.877 --> 32:20.480
He didn't have any control
over his own body.

32:20.548 --> 32:25.251
He pretty much lost control
of his mind too,

32:25.319 --> 32:27.019
but...

32:27.087 --> 32:29.521
Every once in a while,
he would have a few seconds

32:29.589 --> 32:32.824
of lucidity.

32:32.892 --> 32:35.693
He turned to me, and he said,

32:35.761 --> 32:39.598
"it's time."

32:39.666 --> 32:44.503
I hooked up the I.V.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.338
I used gloves.
I knew they'd get me

32:46.406 --> 32:47.539
on the drugs,
but they couldn't prove

32:47.607 --> 32:50.475
who pushed the plunger.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.224
I put in the needle,

33:04.292 --> 33:06.960
and he just...

33:07.028 --> 33:09.696
Got quiet.

33:09.764 --> 33:12.599
And it was over.

33:15.903 --> 33:20.439
And I was alone.

33:20.507 --> 33:23.675
And one day,
I will be that sick,

33:23.743 --> 33:26.311
and there will be no one there

33:26.379 --> 33:29.247
when it's time.

33:49.936 --> 33:53.372
I didn't expect compassion
from you.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.608
I would have taken
commiseration.

33:55.676 --> 33:58.511
Hell, I would have taken
revulsion,

33:58.579 --> 34:02.348
any emotional engagement
at all.

34:05.953 --> 34:09.755
It's no wonder
Cuddy broke up with you.

34:30.077 --> 34:33.746
Folks, Chad Lockerbie just won

34:33.813 --> 34:35.414
first place
in the chili cook-off.

34:35.482 --> 34:37.116
Congratulations, Chad.

34:37.184 --> 34:40.918
That cocoa powder
really did it.

34:40.987 --> 34:43.155
<i>Dumped in a field in Schenectady.</i>

34:43.222 --> 34:44.656
<i>Ouch.</i>

34:44.724 --> 34:46.224
<i>You mind if I make a move?</i>

34:46.292 --> 34:48.159
I know she's out of my league,

34:48.226 --> 34:49.428
but she's at a spud gun contest

34:49.495 --> 34:51.362
with the soon-to-be
five-time runner-up,

34:51.431 --> 34:55.168
so she's probably got
some self-esteem issues.

35:03.446 --> 35:04.446
You wouldn't.

35:40.124 --> 35:43.125
So?
Warning.

35:43.433 --> 35:44.434
They gave you a warning?

35:44.472 --> 35:46.107
Well, it turns out
our friend Harold

35:46.175 --> 35:47.876
felt up the sheriff's daughter

35:47.943 --> 35:49.711
last night
at the potato mash mixer,

35:49.779 --> 35:51.781
so sheriff's feeling
kind of ambivalent.

35:51.848 --> 35:55.151
You always get your way,
don't you?

35:57.087 --> 35:58.655
Not always.

36:01.158 --> 36:05.494
Today would have been
our one-year anniversary.

36:08.665 --> 36:11.667
Which is an incredibly
arbitrary thing to celebrate.

36:17.174 --> 36:18.441
If you want to get
to the bottom of something,

36:18.509 --> 36:21.879
you literally have
to dig down to the bottom.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.383
So stratigraphically,
the oldest stuff I found

36:25.450 --> 36:26.784
was in the bedroom.

36:26.852 --> 36:27.752
<i>And the oldest stuff</i>
<i>in the bedroom</i>

36:27.820 --> 36:29.688
<i>was in the closet.</i>

36:29.756 --> 36:32.391
<i>And at the bottom</i>
<i>of the closet...</i>

36:36.063 --> 36:37.396
Tell me about this.

36:42.068 --> 36:44.235
<i>We have a new symptom.</i>

36:44.303 --> 36:45.703
<i>Infertility.</i>

36:45.771 --> 36:47.438
<i>They wanted kids</i>
<i>but couldn't have them.</i>

36:47.506 --> 36:49.807
She started collecting things
to fill the void.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.042
<i>We should run</i>
<i>a full hormone blood panel.</i>

36:52.110 --> 36:53.744
Hey, Harriet the Spy,

36:53.812 --> 36:55.246
<i>before you get too full</i>
<i>of yourself,</i>

36:55.313 --> 36:57.114
<i>you might want to go back</i>
<i>to bio 101.</i>

36:57.182 --> 36:59.017
It takes two
to not-tango.

36:59.084 --> 37:01.252
<i>Hubby could be shooting blanks.</i>

37:01.320 --> 37:04.923
So either it's a new symptom
that will help us save her life

37:04.991 --> 37:05.958
or it's a complete
waste of time.

37:07.861 --> 37:10.129
Figure out which is fried,
the bacon or the eggs.

37:10.197 --> 37:11.764
I'll start the hormone workup.

37:11.832 --> 37:14.234
<i>There's another option.</i>

37:14.301 --> 37:15.235
<i>House, who's that?</i>

37:15.303 --> 37:17.104
Radio.

37:17.172 --> 37:18.705
<i>Sounded a lot</i> <i>like Thirteen.</i>

37:18.772 --> 37:21.174
It's a Thirteen tribute band
with their new song,

37:21.242 --> 37:22.875
"I've got a better theory
than Masters."

37:22.943 --> 37:24.643
<i>She said they never had kids.</i>

37:24.711 --> 37:26.979
Oh, my God.
Where the hell have you been?

37:27.046 --> 37:30.181
I think we've all got something
a little more important

37:30.249 --> 37:31.749
to worry about than...
<i>No, we don't.</i>

37:31.817 --> 37:33.317
<i>She's been missing for a year.</i>

37:33.385 --> 37:36.287
You can ask her all about it
when she comes in on Monday.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.254
<i>Monday?</i>

37:37.322 --> 37:38.456
This Monday?

37:38.524 --> 37:39.757
<i>Can I talk?</i>

37:39.825 --> 37:41.292
She said they never had kids,

37:41.360 --> 37:42.961
and you all jumped
to infertility.

37:43.029 --> 37:47.600
You never considered
the other option.

37:50.637 --> 37:53.873
And the bitch is back.

38:01.014 --> 38:03.315
We think you have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

38:03.383 --> 38:06.285
It would explain the symptoms.

38:06.352 --> 38:10.088
It also causes miscarriages.

38:13.592 --> 38:16.527
Is that something
you think you might have?

38:28.341 --> 38:31.444
Were you pregnant?

38:34.415 --> 38:36.249
Three times.

38:40.688 --> 38:43.790
<i>The miscarriages</i>
<i>triggered the hoarding.</i>

38:43.858 --> 38:47.561
<i>Hoarding eventually</i>
<i>made you sick too.</i>

38:47.629 --> 38:50.164
Can you cure her?

38:50.232 --> 38:52.199
<i>We can treat</i>
<i>the physical symptoms</i>

38:52.267 --> 38:54.235
<i>as they arise,</i>

38:54.303 --> 38:56.370
<i>make her life</i> <i>a lot better,</i>

38:56.438 --> 38:59.373
but the hoarding,

38:59.441 --> 39:01.709
we're the wrong kind
of doctors.

39:05.781 --> 39:08.383
You lied to me?

39:08.450 --> 39:11.218
For nine years?

39:11.286 --> 39:15.656
I was so afraid of losing you.

39:18.394 --> 39:21.429
What have I ever done
to make you afraid of that?

39:26.970 --> 39:29.505
I need to get some air.

39:47.390 --> 39:48.757
I've been selfish.

39:48.824 --> 39:51.625
I need to let you

39:51.693 --> 39:54.861
move on.

39:54.929 --> 39:59.099
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.400
No.

40:02.504 --> 40:04.271
Um, I just want you
to be able to...

40:04.339 --> 40:06.040
the last time
you got all noble on me,

40:06.108 --> 40:08.242
we ended up dividing
our dishes.

40:08.310 --> 40:10.644
This time, I want
to make the decision.

40:10.712 --> 40:13.714
You don't feel weird
about this?

40:13.782 --> 40:16.483
Of course
I feel weird about this.

40:16.551 --> 40:19.219
It's confusing and messy

40:19.287 --> 40:21.388
and dirty.

40:21.455 --> 40:23.990
Dumb.

40:24.058 --> 40:25.458
But we spent our whole lives
trying to do everything right,

40:25.526 --> 40:27.126
and it sucked.
It wasn't all bad.

40:27.194 --> 40:29.095
It sucked, Chris.

40:29.162 --> 40:31.363
And this,

40:31.431 --> 40:33.265
whatever it is,

40:33.333 --> 40:34.833
it's fun.

40:34.901 --> 40:40.305
So I'm not
taking advantage of you?

40:40.373 --> 40:43.042
The fun is fading.

40:45.814 --> 40:48.982
You know...

40:49.050 --> 40:51.385
there's something
seriously wrong with us.

40:53.089 --> 40:54.990
I know.
