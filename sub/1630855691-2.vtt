00:26.401 --> 00:27.986
My name is Oh-nam Ju.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.781
I like spending time alone.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.617
It's been like that

00:35.452 --> 00:36.911
since I was a child.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.250
When I was young,

00:42.333 --> 00:44.669
the other kids
made fun of me and bullied me.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.589
Go, go, go!

00:47.672 --> 00:52.594
In the world of children, you are degraded
because of how small and chubby you are.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.224
Spin more, more, more!

01:02.687 --> 01:04.981
As I started middle school,
nothing changed.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
-It's mine!
-What you talking about?

01:07.150 --> 01:09.986
-I'm gonna eat it first!
-It's mine. Leave it!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.697
The only way
I was able to get along with them at all

01:13.656 --> 01:16.284
was to remain as invisible as possible.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.537
When I allowed myself to be seen,

01:19.621 --> 01:22.457
the bullying resumed
exactly where it left off.

01:33.718 --> 01:37.555
I gradually became terrified
of people's gazes on me.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.058
And I slowly

01:41.392 --> 01:43.019
disappeared completely.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.440
Nobody was around to listen to me.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.693
Except her.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.907
I love you. I love you.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.701
I love you.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.081
I love you too.

03:50.563 --> 03:55.526

Eh?!

04:49.622 --> 04:51.791
You even got a present for me?

04:53.584 --> 04:55.712
You didn't have to.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.258
Anyway, thanks, Remi-chan!

05:06.139 --> 05:08.057
It's so cute!

05:21.362 --> 05:22.572
Ah, shit.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.366
Hello, Ma.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.619
What the hell took you so long to pick up?

05:28.703 --> 05:31.331
I called in the morning,
but you didn't pick up once!

05:31.831 --> 05:33.499
Do you know what day it is today?

05:34.250 --> 05:35.251
Today is…

05:35.335 --> 05:36.836
-Didn't I tell you I was…
-…my birthday.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.005
… taking a trip
to Jeju Island with my church today?

05:39.088 --> 05:40.048
Oh, right.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.550
God, what am I supposed to do with you?!

05:43.051 --> 05:45.136
You know Du-sik, right? Mrs. Yang's son?

05:45.219 --> 05:47.680
The one who became a doctor.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.848
You know what he did?

05:48.931 --> 05:52.393
He gave money and bought clothes
for his mother's trip! That's what.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.604
Do I really have to spell it out for you?

05:54.687 --> 05:55.730
I-- I'm sorry.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.025
Du-sik even got married to a doctor
as well, for heaven's sake.

05:59.108 --> 06:02.445
Apparently, they both adore Du-sik's mom
and look after her health.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.739
I hear from everyone
that he's the best son around,

06:04.822 --> 06:06.824
and I'm so sick and tired of hearing it!

06:06.908 --> 06:08.034
And then, there's you.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.745
How come you've never had a girlfriend
in your life?

06:12.080 --> 06:14.374
What was that? Did you just sigh?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.000
It was just a yawn.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.669
Look at you!
You're just lying over and over again.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.964
When I raised you alone without a husband,
I didn't have many wishes.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.550
All I wished for
was a grandson to hold in my arms.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.719
You're not even able to do that for me.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.189
I'm still alone.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.403
I'm still afraid of people.

06:50.910 --> 06:51.744
I am…

06:52.537 --> 06:56.416
especially afraid
of meeting a woman's eyes.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.298
Mr. Oh-nam. Here you go.

07:04.382 --> 07:05.883
DOCUMENT FOR APPROVAL

07:08.344 --> 07:11.180
So I prefer looking at a woman's hands

07:11.264 --> 07:13.099
rather than her face.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.270
This woman has moles on both her hands.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.981
In the exact same spot.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.402
Hmm! She got new nails today.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.076
But here,

07:33.202 --> 07:34.454
I was very

07:35.246 --> 07:36.080
different.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.922
All right,
let's have a look at all my cuties.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.302
Daddy will shower you
with tons of Heart Pangs.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.388
I had a personal
favorite among all of them.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.599
Mask Girl.

07:55.892 --> 08:02.440
It's a bummer that she covers her face,
but she provides the best service!

08:05.026 --> 08:05.943
GIFT HEART PANGS

08:08.112 --> 08:11.157
Ah! Once Upon A Prince,
I'm so touch--

08:15.786 --> 08:18.915
They were in the same spot
and were the same size!

08:18.998 --> 08:20.708
Even her nails were the same!

08:20.791 --> 08:25.713
That was when she became special to me!

09:12.134 --> 09:13.928
'ONCE UPON A PRINCE' HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

09:14.011 --> 09:16.055
SWEET POTATO: BITCH MUST LOOK LIKE AN ORC

09:16.138 --> 09:18.641
Are we talking
about my face again?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.269
You really wanna see my face, everyone?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.565
TRUE BEAUTY IS INNER BEAUTY.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.275
LET'S NOT JUDGE PEOPLE BY THEIR LOOKS.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.277
I'm totally with Prince here.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.362
You just talk about how someone looks.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.905
Gosh, aren't you tired of it?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.991
You're right, Mo-mi. You know,

09:35.783 --> 09:39.245
I think those who are less attractive,
are actually more interesting

09:39.328 --> 09:40.580
and mature on the inside.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.374
Those pretty and handsome idiots
never had…

09:44.208 --> 09:46.669
…to experience
any type of rejection.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.255
I agree.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.882
People who are only concerned
with looks are bad.

09:51.966 --> 09:56.178
Hmm, Prince,
what you're saying is really deep.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.222
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.766
All right, enough about looks.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.768
Do you wanna listen to some music?

10:03.436 --> 10:06.272
Hmm, I'm not sure
if the younger generation

10:06.355 --> 10:07.982
is familiar with this song.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.775
It's my all-time favorite.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.111
"Dance In The Rhythm" by Wan-sun Kim.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.739
I sincerely hope
you enjoy it as much as I do.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.543
You are very beautiful,
even without the mask, Mo-mi.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.964
I love you, Mo-mi.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.635
I love you too, Oh-nam.

11:27.478 --> 11:32.483
Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,

11:32.566 --> 11:36.946
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk,
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk.

11:37.029 --> 11:37.863
MILK

11:37.947 --> 11:39.657
-Yes!
-Oh no!

11:39.740 --> 11:42.451
I wore something pretty today.
What do I do?

11:43.077 --> 11:44.954
Okay, here I go!

11:47.998 --> 11:49.208
Ooh!

11:53.087 --> 11:55.423
It's not breaking
as well as I thought.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.800
It must be because the ice is slippery.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.021
All right, let's all have a drink.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.023
Cheers!

12:13.899 --> 12:15.276
Have a drink, everyone.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.868
Cheers.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.377
I think I like this wine too.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.255
French wine is just our type of thing,
isn't that right?

12:36.922 --> 12:39.258
Jeez. I feel like I'm already drunk.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.413
Hi.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.838
That's not what I'm saying.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.425
What I'm saying is that telling a woman
to pour you a glass is wrong.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.718
It doesn't matter if…

13:22.802 --> 13:26.680
Actually, Mr. Park doesn't like
when female employees pour him drinks.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.057
Oh.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.351
…same thing
as a woman touching a man's chest?

13:30.434 --> 13:32.770
-Okay. Whoa, whoa!
-I'm just saying.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.897
Uh-huh. That's enough, you two. Hmm?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.692
-By the way, Mr. Park.
-Why did you put them so far away?

13:38.776 --> 13:42.238
The kids these days,
they're on an entirely different level.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.282
If they do this,
people donate Heart Pangs left and right.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.662
Ooh, it gets really crazy.
If you give 1,000, that's 100,000,

13:49.745 --> 13:51.997
and if you give 10,000,
it's a million won.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.459
Many young people nowadays
are trying to make money in this manner.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.794
Ahh!

13:56.877 --> 13:59.672
Young people
are just outta their minds these days.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.550
Check this out.
The hottest one on this site is her.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.927
Let's see. Here. Her.
She's called Mask Girl.

14:07.638 --> 14:08.764
Uh-oh.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.558
-I'm sorry.
-All good.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.435
I moved to Osan Pass, you know?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.273
Oh, you did?
Then, sure, get in.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.863
Right, Ms. A-reum.
Let's go for another round.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.490
What should we eat
with our second round of drinks--

14:26.574 --> 14:29.034
-Mr. Kim, I…
-Oh! You scared me, damn it.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.871
How long have you been standing here? Huh?

14:31.954 --> 14:35.332
You should've said something
if you were right here. My God, what?!

14:35.416 --> 14:40.170
-I… I just… Uh, I have something--
-Yeah, sure, go, bye.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.464
-Let's get spicy chicken feet!
-Sounds good!

14:42.548 --> 14:43.674
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

14:43.757 --> 14:45.551
Let's go. Hell yeah!

14:45.634 --> 14:47.928
What about you? Any other plans?

15:00.566 --> 15:03.569
No, no.
It was totally coincidental.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.155
My place is on the way to his, that's why.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.742
Anyway. On the way,
his wife called him, right?

15:10.451 --> 15:12.578
But even though
he was in the taxi with me,

15:13.245 --> 15:16.707
he lied to his wife,
saying that he was alone.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.667
Why do you think he did that?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.085
HE COULDN'T BE BOTHERED TO EXPLAIN

15:20.169 --> 15:21.462
Exactly. That's all it is.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.464
He could've just said
that he was in a taxi

15:23.547 --> 15:25.466
with an employee
'cause her place was on the way.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.092
BRAD PIT: YOU'RE SO DELUSIONAL

15:27.176 --> 15:28.636
Yeah. Go, Brad Pit.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.763
'BRAD PIT' HAS BEEN KICKED FROM THE CHAT

15:30.846 --> 15:34.642
Then, how about this?
A while back, I told him like,

15:34.725 --> 15:36.685
"Oh, your perfume smells really nice."

15:36.769 --> 15:37.603
No.

15:37.686 --> 15:41.815
Then, guess what? He started wearing
only that perfume, nothing else.

15:42.524 --> 15:47.279
But as I'm sure you already know,
I have absolutely no feelings for him.

you're supposed to do it!

16:29.279 --> 16:31.782
Mo-mi…

16:32.533 --> 16:35.953
someone like him isn't healthy for you.
Just come to me, and--

17:00.644 --> 17:02.104
I'll get going now.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.707
What are you doing here, Oh-nam?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.752
Oh, uh…

17:25.669 --> 17:26.754
I…

17:27.671 --> 17:29.965
Why are you standing here
and not going home?

17:30.466 --> 17:32.051
-Oh…
-Huh?

17:33.052 --> 17:33.886
Mmm…

17:33.969 --> 17:36.722
Forget it! See you tomorrow!
Weird as fuck.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.432
Yes, sir.

18:00.120 --> 18:00.954

19:47.477 --> 19:50.856
Do you know what love is?

19:50.939 --> 19:52.816
Oh, dear.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.485
-Uh?! Love always hurts.
-Why is this not working?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.696
I know how you feel. Trust me, I know.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.448
Love is something…

19:59.531 --> 20:00.949
Forget that piece of trash.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.701
Feel real love with me now.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.913
Ooh!

20:10.334 --> 20:13.253
Huh? What? What is she doing?

20:14.504 --> 20:17.132
Get it together, Mo-mi. Stop, stop, stop!

20:17.216 --> 20:18.050
No!

20:18.926 --> 20:21.303

-I love it!

…of that son of a bitch, Park.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.145
No!

20:38.820 --> 20:39.696
Excuse me, Mo-mi.

20:40.530 --> 20:41.782
I have something to say.

20:43.533 --> 20:44.368
Pardon?

20:44.993 --> 20:47.788
-You should forget it.
-Uh, forget what?

20:47.871 --> 20:50.040
You should forget about that

20:50.123 --> 20:52.542
trash of a married fucking bastard!

20:52.626 --> 20:54.836
Wh-- What's gotten into you this morning?

20:55.504 --> 20:57.506
I've been watching you all this time.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.509
-What? What do you mean, "watching me"?
-Just--

21:01.218 --> 21:02.803
Not really watching you…

21:07.182 --> 21:09.184
I'm in love with you, Mo-mi!

21:10.852 --> 21:12.271
I love you!

21:22.030 --> 21:23.949
What's wrong with him
all of a sudden?

21:33.250 --> 21:35.544
Why are you
only telling me this now?

21:36.837 --> 21:37.921
What?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.299
'Cause, actually…

21:41.675 --> 21:44.052
I'm in love with you too, Mr. Ju.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.306
You really love me?

22:18.503 --> 22:21.131
Hey. Are you sick? Something wrong?

22:23.925 --> 22:24.885
Oh, uh…

22:26.470 --> 22:27.554
It's my wisdom tooth.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.712
Uh, sorry, uh…

23:01.755 --> 23:02.589
Yes?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.722
N-- No, it's nothing.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.912
So, did you have something
you wanted to say to me?

23:33.995 --> 23:35.497
Oh, that…

23:38.417 --> 23:39.668
Oh, it's nothing.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.462
Th-- There was just a slight error
in the sales figures

23:42.546 --> 23:44.423
in the data reported to Mr. Park, so…

23:44.506 --> 23:46.258
Are you serious? I'm sorry.

23:46.341 --> 23:48.468
It's fine. I adjusted it. He won't notice.

23:49.636 --> 23:53.515
I appreciate it.
Um, see you tomorrow.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.571
No taxi.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.906
I might as well die.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.877
Wait. Wait!

24:24.212 --> 24:27.132
Wait, no, no, no!
Wait, hold on, hold on!

24:27.215 --> 24:29.634
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

24:33.472 --> 24:36.266
Sir, please, follow the cab
in front of you. Hurry up!

24:38.059 --> 24:39.394
Quickly! Quickly!

24:45.484 --> 24:49.946

SEND

25:47.921 --> 25:49.548
What? What's going on?

25:50.549 --> 25:51.591
It's nothing.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.574
Hi, Mom.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.326
Why the hell
do you always pick up so late?

26:18.827 --> 26:21.580
Anyway, I made some side dishes.
When should I drop by?

26:22.539 --> 26:24.708
You don't have to
bring me food, thank you.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.960
I haven't had time to eat at home lately.

26:27.043 --> 26:29.004
What kind of stinking company is that?

26:29.087 --> 26:32.340
They work you to the bone
and pay you an ant's ass worth of money.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.344
Mom, I have to go.
My meeting's starting now.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.305
I'll call you back.

26:38.888 --> 26:39.723
Bye.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.741
MASK GIRL HAS REQUESTED A 1:1 CHAT

26:59.784 --> 27:01.202
ACCEPT

27:03.663 --> 27:04.748
MASK GIRL:
HI?

27:08.168 --> 27:09.878
HEY! IT'S BEEN TOO LONG

27:09.961 --> 27:12.297
I'M SO SAD THAT YOU GOT SUSPENDED.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.301
I THINK I MIGHT AS WELL
QUIT LIVE STREAMING NOW

27:18.595 --> 27:19.721
WHY? NO!

27:21.097 --> 27:23.600
I don't think
I'm a woman who can be loved.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.727
What do you mean?

27:25.810 --> 27:27.646
You're so charming.

27:29.064 --> 27:32.275
Cheer up, Mo-mi!
Be optimistic. I'm here for you.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.694
You'll think differently

27:35.236 --> 27:36.613
once you see my face.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.949
No, don't say that.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.451
I'm not like them.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.666
I can assure you
that I would be good to you, cutie.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.001
DO YOU WANT TO MEET UP?

27:50.085 --> 27:50.919
What?! Oh…

27:51.544 --> 27:53.963
IF I'M ALONE, I MIGHT DIE..

27:54.047 --> 27:55.882
YOU'RE MY FRIEND

28:02.597 --> 28:03.431
WHY SAY THAT?

28:04.891 --> 28:07.143
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

28:10.563 --> 28:13.400
WHY SAY THAT?
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

28:17.028 --> 28:19.531
DON'T SAY YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

28:24.703 --> 28:26.246
HANDSOME MONK'S GONNA BUY ME A DRINK

28:26.329 --> 28:27.872
SORRY FOR SPOUTING NONSENSE

28:27.956 --> 28:29.999
MASK GIRL HAS LOGGED OUT

28:46.141 --> 28:48.852
Gosh, I must be out of my mind.

28:51.771 --> 28:52.605
Damn it.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.774
Whatever happens, happens, I guess.

28:57.777 --> 28:59.112
Hey, Mask Girl!

28:59.195 --> 29:01.322
Oh, you're Mask Girl, right?

29:02.198 --> 29:05.577
Ah, I am so glad to meet you.
I, uh, I'm Handsome Monk.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.413
Wow. I'm so honored.

29:10.623 --> 29:15.670
Your streams are really the best,
Mask Girl. I think they're really amazing.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.340
The other girl creators know,
uh, that they're pretty.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.385
They don't have a--
a professional mindset, whatsoever.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.764
Um, your streams, Mask Girl,
they're honest and open.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.016
That's what's really awesome, you know?

29:28.099 --> 29:31.019
-It's cool!
-Oh, sure. Thanks.

29:32.395 --> 29:35.231
Uh… Um…

29:35.315 --> 29:39.277
How 'bout, uh, we, uh,
speak more casually now?

29:39.944 --> 29:40.945
We're 27.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.948
Oh. Sure, why not.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.701
Then can you take off your mask now?

29:46.785 --> 29:50.121
Oh. I, uh, I'm not hungry.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.582
Come on, I can't eat
all of this all by myself.

29:52.665 --> 29:54.209
Take it off.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.878
Take it-- I'm gonna say it really loud.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.421
-Take it off!
-Okay!

29:58.505 --> 30:00.006
-Take it off!
-Stop.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.591
-Take it off!
-Stop it!

30:11.643 --> 30:15.104
-Don't look at me. I'm embarrassed.
-Wait, hold on.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.443
So why have you been wearing a mask?

30:21.027 --> 30:21.861
You're pretty.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.988
What are you saying?

30:24.906 --> 30:27.408
-You're making fun of me, aren't you?
-No, I'm not!

30:27.492 --> 30:31.788
You're, um, really natural and, uh,

30:33.039 --> 30:34.541
damn it, what's the word, um,

30:35.041 --> 30:36.209
attractive.

30:36.793 --> 30:37.961
Um, charming, you mean?

30:38.044 --> 30:39.754
Charming, that's it!

30:41.005 --> 30:42.757
But you're also totally attractive.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.593
And so,
did you spend time in America?

30:45.677 --> 30:48.847
-Hmm?
-Seems you lived in America for a while.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.974
Uh, until I graduated college.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.768
My family, are in the US.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.645
I live in Korea.

30:56.229 --> 30:57.480
Aren't you a bit lonely?

30:58.231 --> 31:00.191
Um, I was a bit lonely.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.152
When I came to Korea,
I was completely lost.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.071
Okay, so, I cried.

31:05.822 --> 31:06.948
I was alone.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.242
Oh, I know what it's like.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.662
Um…
well, I think it's better now.

31:14.247 --> 31:18.418
Mask Girl, if you go to America,
you'll be really popular.

31:19.043 --> 31:19.878
Yeah?

31:19.961 --> 31:24.507
Yeah! American guys, uh, appreciate girls,

31:25.216 --> 31:26.134
um, with, uh…

31:26.217 --> 31:27.135
Cheekbones?

31:27.218 --> 31:29.637
Yeah. They really like girls
with high cheekbones.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.555
Oh.

31:31.097 --> 31:31.931
Really?

31:33.975 --> 31:37.186
I-- I was thinking
about getting surgery, though.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.105
Ah, please don't.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.650
Mask Girl,
you're really, really attractive.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.152
If you ask me…

31:44.819 --> 31:46.988
No, I'm really against it.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.208
Let's go.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.567
Hey, I apologize
for taking so long.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.778
Oh, no problem. It's fine.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.448
-One more drink?
-Okay.

32:30.531 --> 32:31.950
Do you want something else?

32:32.492 --> 32:36.245
-Um, I'll have the same one as you.
-Okay.

32:37.121 --> 32:37.956
Excuse me!

32:38.706 --> 32:39.999
MASK GIRL

32:40.583 --> 32:41.417
HANDSOME MONK

32:41.501 --> 32:44.003

32:47.256 --> 32:48.925
WAIT UP GUYS
I'M GETTING HER DRUNK

32:49.008 --> 32:51.469
SHE'S EVEN UGLIER THAN I THOUGHT

32:51.552 --> 32:55.598
BUT STILL, I HAVE TO HAVE A TASTE

32:55.682 --> 32:58.601
This bastard!

33:07.151 --> 33:08.695
A whole lot really.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.364
Oh my God!
You're so funny!

33:15.201 --> 33:18.204
You know what?
It's really loud in here, right?

33:18.746 --> 33:22.458
-Do you wanna go somewhere quiet?
-Sure, yeah. Do you know where?

33:22.542 --> 33:25.545
-Mmm, let's go outside and look.
-Sounds good.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.130
Okay.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.048
Let's go!

33:33.177 --> 33:36.389
Uh… Uh-- to--
to Cheong-dong Food Alley, please.

33:42.979 --> 33:48.276
I swear, I thought
Grandma's, um, uh, Bone Hangover Soup,

33:48.776 --> 33:51.112
uh, actually had grandma's bones in it.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.198
-Really?
-Yeah, so I was super scared.

33:56.242 --> 33:59.412
Oh. Well,
should we just get some beers and, uh,

33:59.495 --> 34:00.747
enjoy a quiet drink here?

34:02.206 --> 34:03.041
Uh…

34:04.000 --> 34:05.043
Here?

34:05.126 --> 34:07.587
Mm-hmm. Yeah, let's watch a movie
and have a beer.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.547
It's just…

34:09.630 --> 34:10.840
this is a little too…

34:10.923 --> 34:13.468
Oh, the other places are so noisy.

34:15.970 --> 34:17.096
Come on! Let's go!

34:21.350 --> 34:23.227
I need a room. For a few hours.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.107
-We don't rent rooms by the hour.
-The ones in Bongcheon-dong did.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.402
-Great. We don't do that here.
-Um…

34:32.195 --> 34:35.031
-How much is it for the night?
-Sixty thousand won.

34:47.001 --> 34:47.835
There you go.

34:50.713 --> 34:52.381
All right, Mask Girl,

34:52.924 --> 34:55.051
um, I'll go buy some beers, okay?

34:55.134 --> 34:56.719
You can wait in the room. Here.

35:04.393 --> 35:07.313
Oh, I spent so much fucking money,
I'm so bummed out.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.231
Fuck!

35:08.314 --> 35:10.983
Man, she could've offered
to buy the beers. Shit.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.197
So fucking annoying.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.377
ASSOCIATE MANAGER JU OH-NAM
EIGHT MISSED CALLS

36:11.460 --> 36:13.546
MO-MI, WHERE ARE YOU?
PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS

36:13.629 --> 36:15.006
What's up with him?

36:21.262 --> 36:23.097
You know, um, I don't…

36:23.181 --> 36:25.349
I don't think
we should drink here, though.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.684
Is it even allowed?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.354
You said it was fine. What's wrong? Hmm?

36:31.355 --> 36:33.357
-What's going on all of a sudden?
-Hold on.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.110
I just think it's weird

36:36.861 --> 36:37.695
to be here.

36:40.823 --> 36:43.993
Mask Girl. Come here.
Just come here, sit for a moment.

36:44.076 --> 36:47.788
Whoa, what? Hey, this is a water bed!
Wow, I've never seen this before.

36:49.749 --> 36:53.127
Mask Girl, look!
Just sit down for a moment, hmm?

36:58.090 --> 37:00.635
Okay. Let's cozy up, what do you say?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.763
We could just drink beer here and, uh,

37:04.263 --> 37:06.974
watch a show and have a chat. Casually.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.060
I still don't…

37:10.019 --> 37:10.853
um…

37:14.857 --> 37:15.900
You're so beautiful.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.736
Stop it! No!

37:20.446 --> 37:22.990
Wait. Are you making me
the bad guy here, huh?

37:25.952 --> 37:28.996
We had a really good time, remember? Hmm.

37:34.669 --> 37:35.878
I'm outta here!

37:36.837 --> 37:39.715
If you weren't gonna do it,
you should've told me earlier.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.300
What a fucking waste of money!

37:46.514 --> 37:47.515
I'll refund it.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.393
What?

37:51.894 --> 37:55.439
What are you doing playing hard to get
when you're that fucking ugly?

38:02.905 --> 38:03.948
What did you

38:04.907 --> 38:05.741
just say to me?

38:05.825 --> 38:08.494
When you're that fucking ugly,
why are you playing hard to get?

38:08.577 --> 38:11.247
You practically showed everything
on your live streams.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.499
So what's with this arrogant bullshit?

38:14.125 --> 38:17.795
If you were attractive, I'd let it go,
you know? But you're fucking ugly.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.922
Fucking bullshit.

38:23.217 --> 38:25.177
Shit, are you fucking crazy?

38:27.179 --> 38:29.432
You're fucking pissing me off,
you fucking bitch!

38:29.515 --> 38:33.060
Let go, you fucking bastard!

38:40.192 --> 38:41.694
You!

38:41.777 --> 38:44.238
-Come here, you filthy bitch!
-Let go, you son of a bitch!

38:44.322 --> 38:45.156
Argh!

38:45.239 --> 38:46.741
-Ah! Fuck!
-Hey, wait a second!

38:46.824 --> 38:47.950
You fucking bastard!

38:48.034 --> 38:51.245
-Wait!
-Die! You fucking bastard!

38:51.329 --> 38:54.373
You fucking lied
about coming from America, didn't you?

38:54.457 --> 38:55.791
You son of a bitch!

38:55.875 --> 38:57.835
-Fucking die, you son of a bitch!
-Hey! Stop!

38:57.918 --> 39:00.588
Die, you son of a bitch.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.301
Argh! Let go!

39:10.848 --> 39:11.849
For fuck's sake.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.269
-Fuck you.
-You psychotic bitch.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.438
You bastard.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.274
Die!

39:42.171 --> 39:43.923
Oh shi--

41:01.083 --> 41:03.586
Ambulance.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.004
Ambulance.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.185
GET OUT OF THERE!

41:19.268 --> 41:21.896
HE'S GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU!

41:29.695 --> 41:32.156
ASSOCIATE MANAGER JU OH-NAM

41:41.123 --> 41:43.000
Hello? Hello?!

41:44.001 --> 41:44.877
Mo-mi!

41:51.717 --> 41:52.843
Mo-mi?

41:53.427 --> 41:54.428
Are you all right?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.363
Ugh.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.865
Hmm--

42:20.621 --> 42:21.622
Is…

42:21.705 --> 42:22.915
Is he dead?

42:26.919 --> 42:29.421
I don't know, I…

42:31.298 --> 42:36.053
Uh, this bastard tried to jump me
and force himself on me, so…

42:37.555 --> 42:40.266
I said no, I didn't want to,
but he… didn't…

42:41.016 --> 42:41.892
Kept pushing.

42:57.783 --> 43:00.160
I should report it.
Call the police, right?

43:08.377 --> 43:10.796
If you report it like this,
you might go to jail.

43:12.756 --> 43:15.593
If I say that it was self-defense,
they will understand.

43:16.677 --> 43:17.636
They might…

43:19.722 --> 43:21.181
Wouldn't it work out?

43:22.266 --> 43:25.519
You came to the motel with this bastard
of your own free will, though.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.190
Even if it turns out
to be manslaughter,

43:30.274 --> 43:32.693
you'll have to serve
at least a few years in prison.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.163
Then, what do I do, huh?

44:07.978 --> 44:10.689
You should go home, Mo-mi.
I'll take care of this here.

44:20.282 --> 44:22.785
-Wh-- What do you mean?
-I can take care of it.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.913
You need… to go now.

44:25.996 --> 44:27.998
No, I can't just leave.

44:28.707 --> 44:31.126
-How can I--
-Yes, you can. I'm begging you.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.586
Please go home now.

44:33.545 --> 44:34.838
I don't think that's right.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.800
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please!

44:43.180 --> 44:44.473
Please leave. Just go.

48:37.414 --> 48:40.417
Ms. Sang-sun.
What happened to Ms. Mo-mi? Huh?

48:40.918 --> 48:42.002
-Mo-mi?
-Yeah.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.504
-I'm not sure.
-My goodness.

48:45.005 --> 48:47.341
No, because earlier this morning,

48:47.424 --> 48:49.635
I got a message from HR
letting me know she'd called.

48:49.718 --> 48:51.637
Apparently, she said she's quitting.

48:51.720 --> 48:52.554
What?

48:52.638 --> 48:56.224
I mean, it's incredible.
You just quit by phone these days? Huh?

48:56.308 --> 48:57.476
Can't believe this.

48:57.976 --> 49:01.313
Back in my day,
this was simply unthinkable. Right?

49:01.396 --> 49:04.858
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable. Please leave a--

49:04.942 --> 49:07.694
She's even turned off her phone.
What's goin' on?

49:07.778 --> 49:10.238
…they're on
an entirely different level.

49:10.322 --> 49:12.115
MISSING PERSON CASES

49:12.199 --> 49:13.533
90-YEAR-OLD WITH DEMENTIA MISSING

49:13.617 --> 49:14.993
YONGHAK SISTERS MISSING

49:15.077 --> 49:17.245
LOOKING FOR A MISSING CHILD

49:21.500 --> 49:23.085
MASK GIRL

49:25.045 --> 49:27.923
STREAMER SUSPENDED DUE TO VIOLATION
OF RULES AND CONDUCT DURING LIVE STREAM

49:29.257 --> 49:30.926
Um…

49:32.886 --> 49:37.307
could I get Ms. Mo-mi Kim's home address?
She's from Sales Management.

49:38.058 --> 49:39.226
For what reason?

49:39.309 --> 49:40.227
It's just

49:41.019 --> 49:43.939
that Ms. Mo-mi quit today,
and I think she's

49:45.107 --> 49:46.566
not picking up her phone.

49:48.610 --> 49:52.280
We have to send her stuff to her,
but I don't know her address.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.699
Oh, sure. Hold on, please.

50:22.769 --> 50:25.147
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable.

50:25.230 --> 50:27.024
Please leave a me--

50:55.260 --> 50:57.387
It's been a while, everyone.

50:57.471 --> 50:59.931
Today's my last live stream.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.893
Thank you for everything.

51:17.616 --> 51:19.618
SOMETHING'S OFF ABOUT HER AGAIN
IS SHE DRUNK?

51:36.510 --> 51:39.638
Mo-mi, open the door, please.
I know you're inside.

51:39.721 --> 51:41.723
Come on, open the door right now, Mo-mi!

51:54.194 --> 51:55.028
Come in.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.274
So are you going somewhere?

52:36.027 --> 52:37.696
Why did you leave the company?

52:39.948 --> 52:41.575
I can't go back to work.

52:43.326 --> 52:46.079
Acting like nothing happened
that night in that motel.

52:47.080 --> 52:48.331
Mo-mi, please…

52:49.457 --> 52:51.793
You have to forget
about what happened.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.754
Just disregard it as if it never happened.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.799
You and I both know he deserved to die.

52:58.550 --> 52:59.426
He was

52:59.926 --> 53:01.970
nothing more than just a cockroach.

53:04.556 --> 53:06.057
You're him, aren't you?

53:08.143 --> 53:11.479
Once Upon A Prince.

53:17.235 --> 53:19.196
I thought it was strange…

53:21.573 --> 53:23.783
how you knew that I was meeting with him.

53:25.827 --> 53:28.455
Once I gathered my thoughts,
it became clear.

53:30.665 --> 53:31.917
It's you, isn't it?

53:33.501 --> 53:36.755
You're also the one
who sent me that strange email.

53:39.424 --> 53:40.550
Why did you do that?

53:42.802 --> 53:43.970
Why did you do it?

53:45.555 --> 53:47.307
I didn't do it on purpose.

53:48.266 --> 53:52.437
When I saw you go into a motel with Park,
a burst of anger came over me.

53:56.441 --> 54:00.028
It was the first time I had feelings
like this towards another person.

54:13.959 --> 54:14.918
I'm sorry.

54:23.051 --> 54:24.135
You're right.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.014
You're right, Mr. Oh-nam.

54:28.765 --> 54:29.975
I'm going to…

54:31.810 --> 54:34.271
erase what happened from my memory.

54:37.941 --> 54:38.858
Like you said,

54:40.568 --> 54:43.238
I'm just going to believe
that a cockroach died.

54:44.698 --> 54:45.824
I'm gonna start over.

54:46.658 --> 54:48.493
Now the Mo-mi Kim of the past

54:48.994 --> 54:49.828
is dead.

54:52.497 --> 54:53.873
I'm gonna start anew.

54:55.000 --> 54:55.875
Completely

54:56.835 --> 54:57.669
fresh.

55:00.547 --> 55:01.715
What about me, then?

55:08.763 --> 55:10.557
Are you gonna erase me too, huh?

55:17.188 --> 55:18.231
Mr. Oh-nam…

55:21.818 --> 55:23.653
what do you want me to do for you?

55:26.406 --> 55:27.282
Hmm?

55:34.414 --> 55:36.333
You're the same.

55:44.007 --> 55:45.508
Stop!

55:50.722 --> 55:52.390
Let go! Damn it!

56:19.584 --> 56:21.669
I have to protect you, Mo-mi, okay?

56:22.462 --> 56:23.963
That day, I made the decision

56:24.589 --> 56:25.423
to, uh…

56:26.091 --> 56:28.718
…always protect you from now on.

56:31.763 --> 56:33.264
I love you, Mo-mi!

57:06.005 --> 57:07.966
What the hell did you do?

57:20.311 --> 57:21.521
Son of a bitch.
