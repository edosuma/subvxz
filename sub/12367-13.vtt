00:03.002 --> 00:04.254
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i> IS RECORDED

00:04.337 --> 00:06.005
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.216
HAPPY SHARED FAKE BIRTHDAY,
EVERYONE.

00:08.299 --> 00:09.634
both: HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.677
- SO WHAT
ARE WE GETTING EACH OTHER

00:10.760 --> 00:11.970
FOR OUR FAKE BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR?

00:12.053 --> 00:14.055
- WE'RE GETTING EACH OTHER
DATES,

00:14.139 --> 00:15.098
JUST LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.225
- BUT LAST YEAR WAS A DISASTER.

00:17.308 --> 00:19.894
- I STILL HAVEN'T RECOVERED
FROM MY FIX-UP WITH CHESTER.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.313
YOU KNOW, WITH THE MAN BOOBS.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.442
- I HEAR HE'S MARRIED NOW

00:25.525 --> 00:27.235
AND HAS A BABY.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.612
- HMM.
I WONDER WHO'S FEEDING IT.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.322
- WE'RE GETTING EACH OTHER
DATES.

00:31.406 --> 00:34.117
AND HERE'S WHO I WANT.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.452
- JACK HUNTINGTON?

00:35.535 --> 00:36.494
WOW, HE'S HANDSOME.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.538
- AND RICH.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.957
I'M STEERING MY BOAT
IN A WHOLE NEW DIRECTION--

00:41.040 --> 00:44.002
HOT AND LOADED.

00:44.085 --> 00:46.129
- SO IT'S REALLY OVER
WITH MAX?

00:46.212 --> 00:48.798
- HE HOOKED UP
WITH A YOUNGER WOMAN.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.926
SOME 80-YEAR-OLD BIMBO.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.346
- APPARENTLY,
SHE FAWNS ALL OVER HIM.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.973
- WHY ARE MEN SUCH SUCKERS

00:57.056 --> 00:58.141
FOR WOMEN WHO ARE DUMB
AND ADORING?

00:58.224 --> 01:00.310
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY

01:00.393 --> 01:01.603
HOW I'M GONNA BE
TO GET JACK.

01:01.686 --> 01:04.188
SO HOOK ME UP,
BONY-MARONI.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.277
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I WANT
TO GO ANOTHER WAY TOO.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.114
CAN YOU FIND ME SOMEBODY
LAID-BACK?

01:13.198 --> 01:15.825
MAYBE WITH A BEARD,
LONG HAIR.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.951
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT BEFORE.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.703
- I KNOW JUST THE FELLA.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.539
- WELL, IF WE'RE PICKING
WHAT KIND OF MEN WE WANT,

01:21.623 --> 01:24.167
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A THING
FOR ROBERT DE NIRO.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.337
- I HEAR HE ONLY DIGS
BLACK CHICKS.

01:27.420 --> 01:31.174
- WELL, THEN, FIND ME A MAN
WHO'S LIKE DE NIRO,

01:31.257 --> 01:33.635
BUT FANCIES
PASTY, WHITE WOMEN.

01:33.718 --> 01:39.349
OH, MIX IN A BIT OF PACINO, ADD
A HINT OF SEINFELD FOR LAUGHS.

01:39.432 --> 01:43.186
OOH, AND A DASH OF SEAN CONNERY
CIRCA 1968.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.689
- DONE.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.025
- REALLY?
I MEAN, HOW ON EARTH--

01:49.108 --> 01:50.026
- BUH-BUH-BUH.

01:50.109 --> 01:52.111
DONE.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.697
AND AS FOR ME, MELANIE,
MY REQUIREMENTS ARE SIMPLE.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.991
NO MAN BOOBS.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.203
NOTHING ABNORMALLY LARGE
OR SMALL.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.663
NO THIRD ANYTHING.

02:01.746 --> 02:05.500
JUST YOUR RUN-OF-THE-MILL,
RICH, HANDSOME MAN.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.043
- SO HOW OLD
ARE WE TURNING THIS YEAR?

02:07.126 --> 02:08.877
- HOW ABOUT 42?

02:08.961 --> 02:10.880
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.550
- OH, I CAN'T PASS FOR 42.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.303
PUT ME DOWN FOR 50.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.392
- ELKA, WHAT HAVE WE SAID
ABOUT USING THE "F" WORD?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.738
{\an8}- TO REVIEW,
IF ANY ONE OF US NEEDS HELP,

02:35.822 --> 02:37.490
{\an8}WE USE OUR FAKE LAUGH.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.033
{\an8}- BUT I'M IN BIMBO MODE.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.870
{\an8}I'LL BE FAKE-LAUGHING ALL NIGHT.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.122
{\an8}[giggles]
[high-pitched] OH, JACK.

02:44.205 --> 02:46.749
{\an8}YOU'RE SO HANDSOME AND SMART.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.503
{\an8}I GOT THIS.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.755
{\an8}- HIS ASSISTANT SAID
HE WAS RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.756
{\an8}HE'S FLYING IN
FROM CINCINNATI.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.092
{\an8}PRIVATE PLANE.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.803
{\an8}- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS THAT RICH.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.223
{\an8}MAYBE I BETTER GO DUMBER.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.142
{\an8}- OH, JOY, THERE'S YOUR DATE.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
{\an8}- THAT'S HIM?

03:06.352 --> 03:10.064
{\an8}THE GUY IN THE BROWN SHIRT,
BROWN PANTS, AND BROWN SHOES?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.066
{\an8}PLEASE TELL ME
HE'S NOT AS DULL AS HE LOOKS.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.318
{\an8}- OH, KENNY, THIS IS JOY.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.569
{\an8}- HI, KENNY.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.654
{\an8}- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.656
{\an8}FUNNY THING, I DON'T USUALLY
GO OUT ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.741
{\an8}USUALLY THURSDAYS.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.452
{\an8}ALTHOUGH TODAY FEELS
SOMETHING LIKE A WEDNESDAY.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.914
{\an8}PROBABLY BECAUSE MONDAY
WAS A HOLIDAY.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.415
{\an8}I'M SORRY.
I'M BEING RUDE.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.959
{\an8}WHAT DAY DOES IT FEEL LIKE
TO YOU?

03:30.043 --> 03:33.254
{\an8}- LONGEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.839
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU FIND US A TABLE,

03:34.923 --> 03:38.134
{\an8}AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
- SURE.

03:38.217 --> 03:40.803
{\an8}- YOU WAITED UNTIL THE LAST
MINUTE AGAIN, DIDN'T YOU?

03:40.887 --> 03:42.639
{\an8}- WAITED TILL THE LAST MINUTE,
YES,

03:42.722 --> 03:44.182
{\an8}AND FOUND THE WRONG GUY,
NO.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.892
{\an8}NOW WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE

03:45.975 --> 03:47.143
{\an8}AND FIND OUT WHAT BROWN CAN DO
FOR YOU.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.980
{\an8}- OH, VICTORIA, THERE'S YOUR
DATE AT THE END OF THE BAR.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.023
{\an8}HIS NAME IS TIMOTHY.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.441
{\an8}HE'S A BENEFACTOR

03:53.524 --> 03:54.442
{\an8}AT THE MUSEUM OF MODERN ART.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.320
{\an8}AND, CHECK IT,
NO MAN CLEAVAGE.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.488
{\an8}- SOLD.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.822
{\an8}- [giggles]

03:59.906 --> 04:01.824
{\an8}- OH, HERE COMES YOUR DATE.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.827
{\an8}DR. DOUG.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.830
{\an8}- JESUS.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.374
{\an8}- CUTE, HUH?

04:09.457 --> 04:12.418
{\an8}- NO.
HE LOOKS LIKE JESUS.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.464
{\an8}ELKA, I CAN'T DATE JESUS.
THAT'S A SIN.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.132
{\an8}AND IF IT ISN'T,
IT SHOULD BE.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.134
- RELAX.
IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIM,

04:20.218 --> 04:21.719
IT'LL BE YOUR LAST SUPPER.

04:21.803 --> 04:22.845
[sputters]

04:22.929 --> 04:25.390
- HEY, ELKA.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.600
OH, YOU MUST BE MELANIE.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.519
I'M DOUG.
- HI.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.021
- HE'S A HOLISTIC VETERINARIAN.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.023
ANIMALS COME TO HIM CRIPPLED
AND SICK,

04:34.107 --> 04:35.650
AND HE HEALS 'EM ALL.

04:35.733 --> 04:40.405
- WOW, YOU SOUND
LIKE A MIRACLE WORKER.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.241
- WELL, I GUESS
I JUST HAVE THE TOUCH.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.744
UH, SHALL WE FIND A TABLE?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.538
OH, THAT ONE OVER THERE
LOOKS FREE.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.039
- SURE. GREAT.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.917
THANKS.
- OH. OKAY.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.044
- PROBABLY DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING
LIKE JESUS, RIGHT?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.212
I'M JUST FREAKING OUT
OVER NOTHING.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.762
OH, DEAR LORD.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.476
- HI, I'M ROY.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.728
YOU READY TO ORDER?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.688
- NOT JUST YET.
I'M WAITING FOR MY DATE.

05:13.771 --> 05:17.233
- OH, GOOD,
'CAUSE MY FEET ARE KILLING ME.

05:17.316 --> 05:18.860
[groans]

05:18.943 --> 05:20.570
FIRST NIGHT
ON THE JOB.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.447
I DON'T REALLY NEED THE MONEY,

05:22.530 --> 05:25.450
BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT
OF THE HOUSE, TRY SOMETHING NEW.

05:25.533 --> 05:26.743
SO WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

05:26.826 --> 05:29.245
- I'M TURNING FAKE 50 TODAY.

05:29.328 --> 05:31.456
- WHOA-HO!

05:31.539 --> 05:34.334
WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK A DAY
OVER FAKE 45.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.130
SO WHO'D KEEP A GORGEOUS
CREATURE LIKE YOU WAITING?

05:40.840 --> 05:44.385
- A GORGEOUS CREATURE
LIKE HIM.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.470
- OH.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.929
THAT'S WHAT YOU GO FOR.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.265
PRETTY BOYS.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.603
- ELKA?
- [high-pitched] JACK?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.774
- SORRY I'M LATE,
DARLING,

05:57.857 --> 05:59.400
BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF TRAFFIC.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.029
- ON THE ROAD
OR IN THE SKY?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.947
- ACTUALLY BOTH.

06:05.031 --> 06:09.285
- [giggles]

06:09.368 --> 06:12.997
OH, JACK,
YOU ARE SO SMART AND HANDSOME.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.167
- AND YOU ARE
SO DELIGHTFUL.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.462
WE'LL HAVE A BOTTLE
OF DOM PERIGNON

06:19.545 --> 06:22.256
AND SOME ZUCCHINI STICKS.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.302
- OH, YOU SPEAK
BOTH FRENCH AND ITALIAN.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.058
- AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT REALIZED

06:32.141 --> 06:33.768
THEY HUNG THE ROTHKO
UPSIDE-DOWN.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.811
- [laughs]

06:34.894 --> 06:38.689
EXCUSE ME, WOULD YOU MIND
SCOOCHING DOWN A STOOL?

06:38.773 --> 06:40.108
MY DATE AND I WOULD LIKE
TO SIT TOGETHER.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.776
- NO PROBLEM.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.037
- I'M SORRY,
I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE YOU.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.332
VICTORIA,
THIS IS MY BROTHER, RICHARD.

06:59.418 --> 07:02.088
- AN UPSIDE-DOWN ROTHKO.

07:02.171 --> 07:06.467
[fake laughs]

07:12.932 --> 07:15.852
- SIAMESE TWINS?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.186
- NO WAY.
ARE YOU SURE?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.813
- OH, I'M SURE.

07:18.896 --> 07:22.191
MY SIAMESE TWINS-DAR
HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.027
- VICTORIA, I HAD NO IDEA.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.363
I MET TIMOTHY AT A BENEFIT
AT THE ART MUSEUM,

07:27.446 --> 07:28.489
AND IT WAS SUPER CROWDED.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.032
WE WERE PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.827
I MEAN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A CONVENTION OF SIAMESE TWINS

07:32.910 --> 07:35.705
FOR ALL I KNEW.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.498
- AT LEAST YOU GOT A SHOT
AT ONE OF YOUR DATES

07:37.582 --> 07:38.583
BEING INTERESTING.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.127
- MAYBE MY DATE
COULD PART THEM.

07:42.503 --> 07:46.007
- HE'S JESUS,
NOT MOSES.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.051
- ALL RIGHT, MELANIE, I DON'T
CARE HOW CROWDED IT WAS.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.928
HOW COULD YOU
NOT HAVE NOTICED THIS?

07:51.012 --> 07:54.515
- I WAS A LITTLE BUSY LOOKING
FOR MEN WITHOUT BREASTS.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.853
IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK
IN CLEVELAND.

07:58.936 --> 08:03.566
- OH, WELL, I GUESS
I BETTER GET UP.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.402
THIS GUY'S A RIOT.
- THIS GUY?

08:06.485 --> 08:09.071
- I TOLD HIM SOMEONE JUST TOOK
THE LAST ORDER OF SALMON.

08:09.155 --> 08:09.947
LISTEN TO THIS.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.908
- [as Al Pacino]
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER,

08:11.991 --> 08:13.576
I'M OUT OF ORDER.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.787
THIS WHOLE RESTAURANT'S
OUT OF ORDER.

08:16.871 --> 08:20.791
- [laughing] AL PACINO.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.751
- [as Sean Connery]
DO YOU MEAN IT, MONEYPENNY?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.920
OR ARE YOU JUST BLOWING SMOKE
UP MY KILT?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.922
[laughter]

08:26.005 --> 08:29.300
- NOW HE'S JAMES BOND.
THIS GUY.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.427
- MY GOD, YOU'RE AMAZING.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.761
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DOING IMPRESSIONS?

08:32.845 --> 08:35.932
- WELL, I STARTED
WHEN I WAS 10 OR 11.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.226
NO, NO, NO, I WAS 10.
SEE, THIS IS EASY,

08:38.308 --> 08:39.227
BECAUSE I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE,

08:39.309 --> 08:40.269
AND WHEN YOU'RE IN KINDERGARTEN,

08:40.352 --> 08:41.270
YOU'RE FIVE.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.270
AND THEN YOU ADD FIVE.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.148
YEAH, THAT'S 10.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.233
AND THAT'S WHEN I STARTED

08:45.316 --> 08:46.734
DOING IMPRESSIONS

08:46.817 --> 08:49.237
AND MONSTER MODEL MAKING.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.739
MY BEST ONE'S FRANKENSTEIN.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.824
- HEY, KENNY,

08:53.908 --> 08:58.788
WHAT IF ROBERT DE NIRO LIKED
TO BUILD MODELS OF FRANKENSTEIN?

08:58.871 --> 09:01.749
- [as Robert De Niro]
LOOK AT ME, HUH?

09:01.832 --> 09:03.793
I AM THE FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER,
HUH?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.294
I HAVE BOLTS
IN MY LITTLE NECK.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.796
I AM ELECTRIC AND SCARY.
WHOA.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.756
- [giggles]

09:08.839 --> 09:10.675
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.094
WHAT IF DE NIRO, PACINO,
AND SEAN CONNERY

09:13.177 --> 09:14.929
WERE ALL FIGHTING OVER
WHO GOT TO MARRY ME?

09:15.012 --> 09:16.889
- [as Connery]
LET'S DO THIS THE CHICAGO WAY.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.641
[as Pacino]
NO, WE'RE GONNA DO IT MY WAY.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.851
YOU'RE GONNA MARRY ME, JOY.
HOO-AH!

09:20.935 --> 09:22.645
[as De Niro]
HEY, ARE YOU GONNA MARRY ME?

09:22.728 --> 09:24.105
'CAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE,

09:24.188 --> 09:26.774
SO YOU MUST BE MARRYING ME.

09:29.777 --> 09:32.655
- I WAS BORN IN A SMALL TOWN
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.323
YOU'VE PROBABLY NEVER HEARD
OF IT.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.827
- BETHLEHEM?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.328
- LATROBE.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.332
CAN I REFILL YOUR WINE?
- YES, PLEASE.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.001
- OH, IT SEEMS
WE'RE OUT OF WINE.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.962
- THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.840
- OF COURSE THERE IS.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.010
- IT IS SO EXCITING
FOR A GIRL LIKE I

09:54.093 --> 09:57.430
TO BE OUT WITH SOMEONE
IN THE TIRE BUSINESS.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.307
- WELL, IT'S EXCITING FOR ME
TO BE OUT

09:59.390 --> 10:02.143
WITH SOMEONE WHO GETS
HOW EXCITING IT IS.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.353
- IT'S EXCITING
FOR A WAITER LIKE I

10:04.437 --> 10:07.356
TO BE DELIVERING
YOUR BREAD.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.361
- OOH, WHAT A BIG WATCH.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.365
YOU MUST HAVE
VERY STRONG WRISTS.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.201
- YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, THERE'S
A STORY THAT GOES WITH THIS.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.579
THIS IS--
IT'S A ROLEX PRESIDENT.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.039
IT WAS A GIFT
FROM JACK KENNEDY.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.876
YEAH, THERE WAS A TIME
WE WERE KNOWN AS THE TWO JACKS

10:26.959 --> 10:29.003
AT CERTAIN WATERING HOLES
ON THE CAPE.

10:29.086 --> 10:32.048
- I BET ALL THE GIRLS
LIKED YOU BEST.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.217
- WELL, HE DID HAVE
THE BAD BACK, THOUGH.

10:35.301 --> 10:39.388
- I KNOW.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.724
- SO MELANIE
REALLY NEVER MENTIONED

10:41.807 --> 10:43.392
THAT RICHARD AND I
ARE CONJOINED?

10:43.476 --> 10:48.856
- YOU KNOW, SHE PROBABLY DID,
AND I JUST FORGOT.

10:48.939 --> 10:52.276
- WELL, I WATCH YOUR SHOW,
<i>OH, HI! OHIO!</i> ALL THE TIME.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.029
I LOVE THE WAY YOU ALWAYS SAY
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.240
- OH, NOT ALWAYS.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.244
- YOU KNOW, RICHARD AND I HAVE
A PRETTY COMPELLING STORY.

11:02.328 --> 11:05.414
- OH, REALLY,
WHAT IS IT?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.084
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.877
- I'VE BEEN DIVORCED TWICE,

11:09.960 --> 11:11.921
NO KIDS.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.424
SHOOTING BLANKS.
IT'S A SPERM THING.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.885
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.137
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WONDER--

11:20.221 --> 11:24.433
HOW JERRY SEINFELD MIGHT FEEL
ABOUT HAVING A LOW SPERM COUNT.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.143
- [as Jerry Seinfeld]
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS THIS,

11:26.227 --> 11:28.062
WHO'S ACTUALLY COUNTING
THE SPERM?

11:28.145 --> 11:29.480
THIS IS NOT A GOOD JOB.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.357
YOUR MOTHER CAN'T BRAG
TO HER FRIENDS ABOUT IT.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.109
"FELLAS, HAVE YOU MET MY SON?

11:33.192 --> 11:34.276
"HE COUNTS SPERM.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.486
WE'RE VERY PROUD."

11:35.569 --> 11:37.571
- [laughs]

11:37.655 --> 11:38.906
NOW DO ROBIN WILLIAMS
WITHOUT SPERM.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.950
- [as Robin Williams]
OH, MY GOODNESS.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.576
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE--
OH, THEY'RE GONE.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.245
HELP ME.
OKAY.

11:44.328 --> 11:48.124
- [laughs]

11:48.207 --> 11:50.584
- LOOK, I COULDN'T HELP
OVERHEARING YOU TWO

11:50.668 --> 11:54.171
AS I WAS TAKING A BREAK
WITH THIS NICE COUPLE

11:54.255 --> 11:55.589
WHO OBVIOUSLY BELONG TOGETHER,

11:55.673 --> 11:59.218
AS OPPOSED TO YOU TWO,
WHO I WOULD CALL A BAD FIT.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.929
- AREN'T YOU OUR WAITER?

12:02.012 --> 12:03.806
- I WAS ALSO
A GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

12:03.889 --> 12:05.641
FOR MANY YEARS.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.644
SON, SHE'S ONLY AFTER YOU
FOR YOUR IMPRESSIONS.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.146
- HOW DARE YOU.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.023
TELL HIM OFF.
AS WILLIAM SHATNER.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.651
- AS I USED TO TELL MY STUDENTS,

12:15.734 --> 12:18.112
YOU GOT TO APPLY TO THE SCHOOL
THAT'S GONNA LET YOU IN.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.447
- BUT SHE'S SO PRETTY.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.115
- OH, SHE'S A DOLL.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.451
BUT THE GIRL AT THE BAR
ISN'T BAD EITHER,

12:23.534 --> 12:28.330
AND SHE APPEARS TO HAVE
A VERY LOOSE ADMISSIONS POLICY.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.042
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T TAKE
MY DATE AWAY FROM ME.

12:32.126 --> 12:33.836
- CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HIM?

12:33.919 --> 12:37.673
- YES, I FIND HIM CHARMING
AND ATTRACTIVE.

12:37.756 --> 12:42.386
- WHEN HE'S HIM?
- NO.

12:42.470 --> 12:43.929
OH, FINE, GO.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.350
- COME ON.
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU TO HER.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.938
- [as William Shatner]
WHY MUST LOVE BE SO COMPLICATED?

12:53.022 --> 12:55.024
WHY MUST OUR PLANET BE FILLED
WITH BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

12:55.107 --> 12:58.986
WHO EXIST SIMPLY
TO BREAK OUR HEARTS?

13:01.071 --> 13:05.367
- WAIT!
WAIT, NOW I WANT YOU BACK!

13:05.451 --> 13:08.204
WELL, NOW I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A DATE.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.623
THE WAITER FIXED HIM UP
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.541
- I WISH HE'D BREAK UP MY DATE
WITH JESUS.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.084
I'D BREAK UP WITH HIM MYSELF,

13:14.168 --> 13:15.794
BUT HE'D JUST SHOW UP
THREE DAYS LATER.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.217
- DO WE REALLY WANT TO PLAY
WHO HAS THE WORST DATE?

13:21.300 --> 13:25.387
BECAUSE I AM ON A DATE
WITH CONJOINED TWINS.

13:25.471 --> 13:29.058
- I'LL BET MAN BOOBS ARE LOOKING
PRETTY GOOD TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.562
- LOOK, IF I CAN SUCK IT UP
WITH JESUS--

13:33.646 --> 13:36.565
OH, GOD,
THAT JUST SOUNDS SO WRONG--

13:36.649 --> 13:38.400
CAN'T YOU JUST STICK IT OUT
WITH TIMOTHY?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.736
- I AM ON A DATE
WITH CONJOINED TWINS.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.363
- BUT HE'S A REALLY NICE GUY.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.782
- I AM ON A DATE
WITH CONJOINED TWINS.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.742
- I KNOW.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.744
BUT STILL THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.579
- ARE THEY HUMAN BEINGS

13:50.663 --> 13:51.914
OR HUMAN BEING?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.500
'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.254
- MY DATE'S GOING GREAT.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.422
HE THINKS I'M AN IDIOT.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.592
- I'M GOING HOME.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.094
- OH, NO, NO, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, NO.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.096
YOU'RE DATELESS,
AND I HAVE TWO DATES.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.806
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE,
COME AND SIT WITH ME.

14:08.889 --> 14:10.766
YOU CAN BE THE FOURTH WHEEL

14:10.849 --> 14:12.268
OR THE THIRD AND A HALF WHEEL.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.853
I JUST--
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.280
- SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE NOT
GOING TO BE HAVING DINNER HERE,

14:24.363 --> 14:27.116
HOW ABOUT WE TAKE A DRIVE
UP TO MY LAKE HOUSE?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.951
I'LL HAVE MY PRIVATE CHEF
WHIP US UP

14:29.034 --> 14:30.119
A LITTLE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

14:30.202 --> 14:35.165
- EVERYTHING YOU SAY
IS SO INTERESTING.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.294
- OH, BOY,
YOU GUYS MUST BE STARVING.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.296
- NEVER MIND.
JUST BRING US THE CHECK, PLEASE.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.964
WE'RE GOING BACK TO MY PLACE.

14:42.047 --> 14:46.635
- OH. MIGHT WANT
TO FIX YOUR HAIR FIRST.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.803
- WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.305
- LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.

14:49.388 --> 14:54.393
THE 'DO'S GETTING
A LITTLE BIT TRUMPY.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.734
- ELKA, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMETHING.

15:03.193 --> 15:06.447
NOBODY LOOK.
NOBODY LOOK, PLEASE.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.494
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:12.578 --> 15:16.290
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN GIRLS
LIKE YOU PLAYING DUMB

15:16.373 --> 15:17.875
TO GET THE BOY,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.502
YOU END UP PREGNANT,

15:20.586 --> 15:24.006
AND THERE'S NO GRADUATION GOWN
IN THE WORLD CAN COVER IT.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.468
- YOU KNOW,
IN SOME WAYS,

15:27.551 --> 15:29.928
THIS ISN'T ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

15:30.929 --> 15:34.475
- WELL, IN SOME WAY,
IT IS.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.311
I SEE A SADNESS
BEHIND YOUR EYES.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.480
AND I KNOW
BECAUSE I SEE THE SAME THING

15:39.563 --> 15:40.731
WHEN I LOOK INTO A MIRROR.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.777
I LOST MY WIFE RECENTLY.

15:44.860 --> 15:48.656
THAT'S WHY I'M OUT
DOING THIS THING.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.823
WHAT DID YOU LOSE?

15:49.907 --> 15:53.369
- I LOST MY MAX.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.703
- CANCER?

15:54.787 --> 15:58.082
- WORSE.
FLORIDA.

15:59.750 --> 16:03.504
YOU KNOW, MAX AND I MET
RIGHT AT THIS EXACT SPOT

16:03.587 --> 16:04.713
A YEAR AGO.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.256
- I KNOW IT HURTS,

16:06.340 --> 16:07.549
BUT JUMPING TO THE NEXT GUY

16:07.633 --> 16:09.259
ISN'T GONNA MAKE IT
ANY BETTER.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.221
SOMETIMES YOU GOT
TO SIT WITH THE PAIN.

16:14.473 --> 16:17.851
- SO YOU CAN NEVER FLY
FIRST CLASS?

16:17.935 --> 16:22.356
- NO, THE ARM RESTS ONLY GO UP
IN COACH.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.734
- OH, THAT IS SO SAD.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.194
- I LOVE ENGLAND.

16:27.277 --> 16:30.322
I GET TO DRIVE THERE.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.910
- OH, RIGHT.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.746
YOU'RE READING YEATS.
- MM.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.289
"NOW THAT MY LADDER IS GONE,

16:39.373 --> 16:42.251
I MUST LIE DOWN
WHERE ALL LADDERS START."

16:42.334 --> 16:44.920
- "IN THE FOUL
RAG-AND-BONE SHOP OF THE HEART."

16:45.003 --> 16:46.588
- OH.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.134
- SO ON FACEBOOK,
ONE PAGE OR TWO?

16:52.302 --> 16:54.763
- I'M REALLY ENJOYING
BEING WITH YOU.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.975
- AND ALSO WITH YOU.

16:58.058 --> 17:01.437
I MEAN, I'M ENJOYING YOU TOO.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.815
- REALLY? BECAUSE YOU SEEM
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.275
- SHE'S COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT

17:06.358 --> 17:09.194
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
YOU LOOK LIKE JESUS.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.490
- YEAH.
WELL, THERE IS THAT.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.117
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT BUMBLING WAITER

17:16.201 --> 17:18.829
WAS TALKING ABOUT.
MY HAIR IS PERFECT.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.291
WELL, LIKE THEY SAY
IN THE RUBBER BUSINESS,

17:23.375 --> 17:25.252
LET'S BOUNCE.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.296
- I DON'T THINK SO.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.172
- WHY NOT?

17:28.255 --> 17:30.132
I THOUGHT WE WERE HAVING
A GREAT TIME.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.677
BESIDES, I HAVE NEVER ENJOYED
CHATTING WITH A WOMAN MORE.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.137
- TELL YOU WHAT,

17:35.220 --> 17:36.764
I'LL GO WITH YOU

17:36.847 --> 17:38.682
IF YOU CAN TELL ME ONE THING

17:38.766 --> 17:39.808
YOU LEARNED ABOUT ME TONIGHT.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.145
- WELL...

17:43.228 --> 17:46.565
[laughs]
WHEN...

17:49.359 --> 17:50.819
- EXACTLY.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.489
I'M SORRY
IF I LED YOU ON.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.324
- ME TOO.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.326
- GOOD NIGHT, JACK.

17:57.409 --> 18:01.163
- GOOD NIGHT, ELKA.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.957
IT WASN'T THE HAIR,
WAS IT?

18:06.543 --> 18:11.131
'CAUSE IF IT WAS,
IT WOULD--IT WOULD HAUNT ME.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.348
- WHY DO MEN
LIKE DUMB WOMEN?

18:19.431 --> 18:22.392
- WELL, NOT ALL MEN.
I LIKE SMART WOMEN.

18:22.476 --> 18:26.146
- MAYBE YOU AND I...

18:26.230 --> 18:29.483
- OH, WELL,
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.737
LET ME JUST ADD
A COUPLE OF ZEROS TO MY TIP

18:33.821 --> 18:36.323
AND DINNER'S ON ME.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.703
- WELL, WHEN IT COMES
TO FRENCH MOVIES,

18:41.787 --> 18:45.749
I GO FOR THE PRETENTIOUSNESS
BUT I STAY FOR THE SEX.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.543
- HEY, THERE'S A TRUFFAUT
DOUBLE FEATURE AT THE ART HOUSE

18:47.626 --> 18:50.212
AROUND THE CORNER.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO SOMETIME.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.714
- WHY DON'T THE TWO OF US
SNEAK OUT NOW?

18:55.092 --> 18:57.719
OH.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.721
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT SEPARATING?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.181
- WE LOOKED INTO IT.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.308
BUT IT'S JUST TOO RISKY
MEDICALLY.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.561
- IS THIS A DEAL BREAKER
FOR YOU?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.896
- TO BE HONEST,
I'M NOT SURE.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.897
- HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.232
BUT OUR DATES ARE OVER,

19:10.315 --> 19:11.358
SO WE WERE
JUST GONNA HEAD ON HOME.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.026
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S GETTING LATE,

19:13.110 --> 19:15.571
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD SAY
GOOD NIGHT AS WELL.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.739
- NO.
YOU GO AHEAD.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.740
I'M STAYING.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.201
- REALLY?

19:21.285 --> 19:23.120
- YES.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.372
I'M SO QUICK
TO REJECT ANY MAN

19:25.455 --> 19:27.040
WHO DOESN'T FALL
INTO SOME NARROW VIEW

19:27.124 --> 19:28.876
OF WHAT I THINK
IS THE RIGHT GUY.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.752
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.755
I SEE GOODNESS AND HONESTY
WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.593
- RICHARD, YOU LYING,
CHEATING RAT BASTARD!

19:37.676 --> 19:39.761
GET YOUR HANDS
OFF MY HUSBAND.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.764
- YOU'RE MARRIED,
AND YOU WERE HITTING ON ME?

19:42.848 --> 19:45.225
- I'M CONJOINED.
I'M NOT DEAD.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.442
{\an3}- SO IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
WITH THAT OTHER WOMAN EITHER?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.110
{\an3}- [as Bill Clinton]
I DID NOT HAVE SEXUAL FEELINGS

19:55.193 --> 19:58.655
{\an3}FOR THAT WOMAN.
[laughter]

19:58.739 --> 20:00.782
{\an3}- HOW WOULD GEORGE BUSH FEEL
ABOUT THAT WOMAN?

20:00.866 --> 20:02.159
{\an3}- [as George W. Bush]
WELL, I DECIDED SHE WASN'T

20:02.242 --> 20:04.453
{\an3}RIGHT FOR ME,
'CAUSE I'M THE DECIDER.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.788
{\an3}AND THESE ARE
THE DECIDER HOUSE RULES.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.792
[laughter]

20:10.876 --> 20:13.462
{\an3}- HE JUST PICKED UP.
DO IT.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.797
