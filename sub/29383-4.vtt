WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:06.307
(exhales)

00:06.340 --> 00:08.276
(sniffs) Ah!

00:08.309 --> 00:10.411
MONTANA:
Let's hit it, boys.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.880
-("Rebel Yell" by Billy Idol
playing)
-(grunts)

00:12.913 --> 00:14.115
Come on.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.151
Shut up and dance.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.519
Kick. And jump.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.654
Two, three.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.123
And other side.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.857
Thrust. And thrust.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.159
Hips, and roll it.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.627
And touch that hair.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.996
And roll that pussy.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.134
(grunts)
Come on, yeah.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.268
* Last night a little dancer *

00:34.302 --> 00:37.071
* Came dancin' to my door *

00:37.105 --> 00:38.472
Two, three.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.473
* Last night a little angel *

00:39.507 --> 00:42.042
Pas de bourrÃ©e,
and thrust that ball...

00:43.844 --> 00:46.414
* She said, "Come on, baby *

00:46.447 --> 00:50.050
* "I got a license for love *

00:50.084 --> 00:52.120
* "And if it expires *

00:52.153 --> 00:54.388
* Pray help from above" *

00:54.422 --> 00:57.991
* Because in the midnight hour *

00:58.025 --> 01:00.060
* She cried more, more, more *

01:00.094 --> 01:01.195
And thrust.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.531
* With a rebel yell *

01:03.564 --> 01:07.468
* She cried
more, more, more, wow! *

01:07.501 --> 01:09.870
-* In the midnight hour, babe *
-(grunts)

01:09.903 --> 01:12.005
-* More, more, more *
-And punch.

01:12.039 --> 01:15.376
* With a rebel yell *

01:15.409 --> 01:20.047
* More, more, more,
more, more, more *

01:23.016 --> 01:24.752
(grunts)

01:24.785 --> 01:26.520
* She don't like slavery *

01:26.554 --> 01:30.324
* She won't sit and beg *

01:30.358 --> 01:33.927
* But when I'm tired
and lonely... *

01:34.962 --> 01:36.564
(grunts)

01:36.597 --> 01:39.032
Keep it going, boys.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.971
Hey, Rambo.

01:44.004 --> 01:45.406
My class isn't for posers.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.575
This is aerobics; it's serious.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.710
Billy Idol's the truth, man.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.046
Grapevining in full combat gear,
that's a choice.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.682
I'm training.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.384
You gotta stay ready.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.152
The world's a shit place.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.788
-And everyone's gone soft.
-Look.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.056
I'm just saying, if you're
really trying to make a move,

02:03.090 --> 02:06.194
you'd have something more studly
than a Buck 119 in your holster.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.996
Bubble Gum Barbie's into blades?

02:10.798 --> 02:12.600
ROD:
Montana,
what's with this metal shit?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.368
I'm trying to get shredded,
okay?

02:14.402 --> 02:17.205
Why can't you play something
fun, like Cyndi Lauper?

02:17.238 --> 02:19.106
* With a rebel yell *

02:19.139 --> 02:21.975
-* She cried more, more, more *
-(gasps)

02:22.009 --> 02:23.211
-* In the midnight hour *
-(music gets louder)

02:23.244 --> 02:26.113
-Suck it, Rod, hard.
-ROD: Wow.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.481
Suck it hard.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.082
Everybody else down!

02:29.116 --> 02:30.851
Wow. You know what?
I'm-I'm telling Rudy.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.820
-Rock and roll is dead.
-MONTANA: Get on the floor!

02:32.853 --> 02:34.188
-Bitch! (groans)
-Fuck you!

02:34.222 --> 02:36.257
(echoing):
* More, more. *

02:48.035 --> 02:51.138
MONTANA:
Love you, too, baby!

03:05.919 --> 03:07.955
(liquid dripping)

03:11.359 --> 03:13.227
ROD:
You know what?
I'm-I'm telling Rudy.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.329
MONTANA:
Suck it, Rod, suck it hard.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.930
RAMIREZ:
You like my surprise?

03:17.998 --> 03:20.668
You did this?

03:22.002 --> 03:25.072
RAMIREZ:
I didn't like
how he talked to you.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.309
Or his lack of appreciation
for Billy.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.911
And rock and roll in general.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.717
(grunts)

03:38.986 --> 03:42.390
That's the most fucked up thing
anyone's ever done for me.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.560
That's... so...

03:49.129 --> 03:51.131
hot.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.400
(grunts)

04:07.681 --> 04:10.584
(panting)

04:28.101 --> 04:29.437
MONTANA:
We can't leave that there.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.672
I got a class at 7:00
in the morning.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.807
Don't worry, baby.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.077
I know how to clean up messes.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.580
I was a janitor once.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.914
(chuckles)

04:40.948 --> 04:42.516
Have you killed
a lot of people?

04:42.550 --> 04:43.717
Mm.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.519
Would you kill me?

04:49.256 --> 04:50.424
No.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.364
Would you kill for me?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.799
You gotta ask?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.869
There's this girl.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.805
(screaming)

05:04.838 --> 05:07.475
She took away the only thing
I ever cared about.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.745
The only person
who ever loved me.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.048
My brother.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.385
(screaming)

05:18.419 --> 05:20.388
Sam was my everything.

05:20.421 --> 05:24.024
He was Billy Idol-cool,
but he had a heart of gold.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.694
It wasn't even his damn wedding.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.663
Joey was his roommate
in college in Florida.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.365
I never even knew the guy
or Brooke.

05:31.399 --> 05:35.068
But I know Brooke fucked
my brother and lied.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.137
And now he's dead.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.843
Why does she get to live
when he's gone?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.879
Just tell me where she is.

05:47.314 --> 05:51.251
She won't see any more sunrises
after I find her.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.991
Promise me she'll suffer.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.461
I want it to be painful.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.863
I promise.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.131
I do.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.636
(music slows, distorts)

07:15.669 --> 07:17.104
(film projector clicking,
then shuts off)

07:25.145 --> 07:27.180
Fuck.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.882
Why the hell
haven't you killed her yet?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.884
I-I almost had her.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.954
-(screaming)
-(Ramirez yells, grunts)

07:33.987 --> 07:36.189
(yelling)

07:36.223 --> 07:37.424
You need to get
your shit together.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.326
There's another killer
running around,

07:39.359 --> 07:41.194
-and if we don't get her...
-Wait. Wh-What do you mean?

07:41.228 --> 07:41.995
Jingles.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.031
The Mr. Jingles?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.899
He sliced up two guys
right in front of me.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.635
We need to get to Brooke first,

07:47.668 --> 07:49.469
kill her,
and get the hell out of here.

07:49.503 --> 07:53.206
Two guys? At the same time?
Is he a ninja?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.709
Ricky, you need to focus.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.378
I need this, babe.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.014
That bitch has got to pay
for what she's done.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.658
(groaning)

08:12.359 --> 08:15.162
-You're gonna be okay.
-(coughing)

08:15.195 --> 08:16.797
TREVOR:
Here. Careful.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.003
(coughing)
I don't feel so good.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.838
Is this what dying feels like?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.006
(groaning)

08:26.039 --> 08:27.440
XAVIER:
You're gonna be okay.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.476
-Yeah.
-Trevor knows what he's doing.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.515
Oh, shit.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.450
Chet. Chet. Chet.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.587
-God, he's lost a lot of blood.
-He's dead.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.657
TREVOR:
Not quite.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.693
XAVIER:
Hey.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.098
-Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?
-Whoa, wh-wh-whoa.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.133
It's epinephrine for, like,
peanut allergies and shit.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.102
It-It's, like, pure adrenaline.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.536
You sure it's gonna work?

08:56.570 --> 08:58.872
It's not gonna make him worse.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.747
(crickets chirping)

09:09.482 --> 09:10.651
(Trevor grunts)

09:13.186 --> 09:14.521
It didn't work.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.124
-(all screaming)
-Oh, my God!

09:17.157 --> 09:18.992
-(panting)
-XAVIER: What the fuck?

09:19.026 --> 09:20.560
What just happened?

09:20.594 --> 09:23.030
Feels like my heart's
beating out of my chest.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.031
(Trevor groans)

09:24.064 --> 09:25.999
(Chet groaning)

09:26.033 --> 09:26.934
At least it's beating there.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.535
-(coughing)
-Oh, God.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.404
We need Ray and Montana
to get here with the cops now.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.572
Ray's a choad.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.207
He left me to die.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.743
The cops are looking for him.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.944
He told me he killed someone
in college.

09:36.977 --> 09:40.013
I thought making porn was bad.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.215
-What?
-What?

09:42.249 --> 09:43.550
Nothing.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.552
Oh, my God!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.420
Porn! Blake!

09:47.454 --> 09:49.857
The guy with the spike
through his eye.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.625
He-he drove here
in his Cadillac.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.994
The keys are still in the car.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.328
It's parked right by
the showers.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.797
We have a way out!

09:56.830 --> 09:58.165
Okay. Okay. Let's grab Margaret
and Bertie,

09:58.198 --> 10:00.067
a-and then
we'll head to the car.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.202
What if we're too late?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.871
-All right, let's go.
-Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.272
-No.
-(coughing)

10:07.374 --> 10:09.242
Here.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.746
Don't be an idiot.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.283
You're way too messed up.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.151
You lie low.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.057
I'll go get Bertie.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.425
I'll get Margaret.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.861
Then we'll circle back around
for you, okay?

10:27.895 --> 10:29.329
We'll all meet at the car.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.334
For protection.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.832
(screaming)

11:06.466 --> 11:08.101
Margaret.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.037
They're dead.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.638
(panting):
Jingles killed them.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.673
He's here.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.008
Jingles did this?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.844
Come on. We have to get the fuck
out of here.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.478
-Language.
-Fuck that.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.949
This place is a killing field,
Margaret. I mean, look.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.183
Who knows
how many more dead bodies

11:23.216 --> 11:24.684
are out here in this camp?

11:24.718 --> 11:26.019
Come on.
There's a car by the showers.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.287
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.622
Did you hear what I just said?

11:29.656 --> 11:32.025
There is a school bus full
of eager campers

11:32.059 --> 11:34.928
coming here at sunrise,

11:34.962 --> 11:36.997
and they will be perfectly safe,

11:37.030 --> 11:40.000
because I have a gun.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.268
(laughs)

11:41.301 --> 11:43.070
Okay. Okay, Margaret.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.639
You know, I-I'm gonna go back
to the real world now.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.213
(insects chirping)

12:09.396 --> 12:11.899
(Stevie Nicks'
"Leather and Lace" playing)

12:11.932 --> 12:13.934
(keys jingling)

12:20.974 --> 12:22.442
Bertie.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.177
Kitchen's closed, hon.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.779
Unless you're looking

12:25.813 --> 12:26.947
for a little midnight snack.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.548
(growls)

12:28.581 --> 12:30.583
Do you have any idea
what's happening here?

12:30.617 --> 12:32.285
Yeah. I'm making sandwiches.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.487
Kids'll be here
in a couple of hours.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.723
They're gonna be suffering
from acute homesickness.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.191
And nothing cures
acute homesickness

12:38.225 --> 12:40.794
-like a bologna sandwich.
-You don't understand!

12:40.828 --> 12:42.095
We're all gonna die.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.997
He's slaughtering everyone
like dogs.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.899
(laughs)

12:45.933 --> 12:47.167
What is it about this place

12:47.200 --> 12:49.069
that makes everybody see
the bogeyman?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.538
Calm down, take a breath.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.173
I am gonna heat you up
some Swiss Miss.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.541
No, Bertie. Jesus Christ.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.676
-You got to listen to me, okay?
-(keys jingling)

12:58.045 --> 12:59.112
It's him.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.015
* Still I carry this feeling *

13:02.049 --> 13:03.884
-(keys jingling)
-* When you walked *

13:03.917 --> 13:06.119
* Into my house *

13:06.153 --> 13:09.122
* That you won't be walking
out the door *

13:11.624 --> 13:14.995
* Still I carry this feeling *

13:15.028 --> 13:16.864
* When you walked
into my house... *

13:16.897 --> 13:18.765
Benjamin.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.267
Well, what are you doing here?

13:20.300 --> 13:22.469
I-I didn't know
they let you out.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.237
They didn't.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.406
Hmm. All the same,

13:26.439 --> 13:29.843
it's... nice to see you
in my canteen again.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.313
* My city, your mountains *

13:33.346 --> 13:35.182
* Stay with me... *

13:35.215 --> 13:36.984
I'll bet you're hungry.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.418
Why don't you sit down?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.153
I'll fix you something.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.055
Peanut butter and jelly, right?

13:42.089 --> 13:45.158
I was just about
to start making those.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.660
I never forget a sandwich order.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.063
* My lace. *

14:09.516 --> 14:11.151
Why'd you come back?

14:14.054 --> 14:16.489
When Margaret told me
she was reopening this place,

14:16.523 --> 14:17.991
I thought she'd lost her mind.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.460
I mean, who the hell wants
to relive that night?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.698
And then it hit me.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.700
She was still living it.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.503
That horrible past
was her prison.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.341
And if coming back here
is what she needs

14:34.374 --> 14:37.544
to finally turn the page,
I wanted to be there for her.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.480
She was a weird kid, but...

14:40.513 --> 14:42.449
she always meant well,
far as I could tell.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.920
We can't fix
what's already done.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.827
But we always got a say
in what happens next.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.066
-(loud thud)
-(gasps)

15:00.000 --> 15:01.401
(Bertie gasps)

15:05.038 --> 15:07.240
You always hated the crust.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.745
Mmm.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.384
(click)

15:32.765 --> 15:34.767
(grunting)

15:38.138 --> 15:39.139
-Aah!
-(grunts)

15:46.879 --> 15:48.581
(Mr. Jingles shouts)

16:03.230 --> 16:06.099
(clattering)

16:06.133 --> 16:07.200
(sizzling)

16:07.234 --> 16:08.168
(knocking)

16:08.201 --> 16:10.070
XAVIER:
Hello?

16:10.103 --> 16:12.639
(clattering)

16:14.841 --> 16:17.177
(sizzling)

16:19.612 --> 16:21.614
Hey. Hey!

16:23.850 --> 16:26.653
Ah. Hey-- hey!

16:42.735 --> 16:44.771
(panting)

16:48.941 --> 16:50.077
(screaming)

16:56.149 --> 16:58.251
-(groans)
-(bangs on door)

16:58.285 --> 17:00.520
(panting)

17:00.553 --> 17:02.089
Hello?

17:02.122 --> 17:03.690
Hello!

17:05.692 --> 17:06.993
(sighs)

17:30.583 --> 17:32.919
(panting)

17:43.163 --> 17:44.897
(screams)

17:46.933 --> 17:49.102
(grunting)

17:51.971 --> 17:53.840
(screaming)

17:55.842 --> 17:58.711
Help! Help!

17:58.745 --> 18:01.848
(screaming)

18:03.850 --> 18:05.252
Help!

18:05.285 --> 18:07.154
(grunting)

18:09.156 --> 18:10.757
RITA:
I knew you'd go left.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.125
(Brooke gasps)

18:13.226 --> 18:15.695
Textbook victim mentality,

18:15.728 --> 18:17.697
seeking safety in numbers.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.032
The other path would have led
to the road.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.601
You'd have been home free.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.170
(clicks tongue)
Actually, no.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.105
I set bear traps there, too,
so, same result.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.341
-Rita, why?!
-Not my name.

18:28.375 --> 18:29.876
I told you.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.411
I'm not the nurse.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.580
I'm a psychologist.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.782
After I set Jingles free,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.684
I took Nurse Rita's place

18:37.717 --> 18:39.552
-so I could be with him here.
-(grunts)

18:39.586 --> 18:41.854
-Oh.
-You brought Jingles here?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.223
It's not what you think.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.358
I'm doing this for science.

18:45.392 --> 18:49.862
I've spent my life studying what
makes men like Benjamin kill.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.130
But there's only so much

18:51.164 --> 18:53.099
that you can learn
from a caged animal.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.403
I needed to study
an apex predator in the wild.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.137
(Rita chuckles)

18:58.171 --> 19:00.673
Will Jingles take up a life

19:00.707 --> 19:03.643
that's served up to him
on a silver platter?

19:03.676 --> 19:07.914
Or does he need the thrill
of the hunt before he kills?

19:07.947 --> 19:10.883
You're hanging up here to answer
that very important question.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.885
Fuck your research!

19:12.919 --> 19:15.087
You're nothing more
than a killer, just like him!

19:15.121 --> 19:18.625
I'm a scientist,
and you're my lab rat.

19:18.658 --> 19:23.463
Victims of serial killers
are overwhelmingly female.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.998
Thank you for your sacrifice.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.569
I promise you'll be remembered
as a feminist hero.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.137
(screams)

19:31.170 --> 19:33.306
(sizzling)

19:37.176 --> 19:39.512
-(screaming)
-(sizzling)

19:39.546 --> 19:41.047
(groans)

19:41.080 --> 19:43.683
(grunting)

19:49.956 --> 19:50.990
Bertie.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.026
Bertie.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.362
Bertie!

19:58.765 --> 19:59.732
(gasps)

19:59.766 --> 20:02.001
(Bertie wheezing)

20:02.034 --> 20:03.670
Bertie.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.339
I'm gonna go get help.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.341
(wheezes)

20:08.375 --> 20:10.076
What is it?

20:10.109 --> 20:12.044
(panting)

20:16.249 --> 20:18.351
(gasps)

20:24.824 --> 20:26.826
No.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.035
I, I can't.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.870
Please.

20:53.553 --> 20:56.122
(both screaming)

21:08.601 --> 21:10.603
(groans)

21:46.406 --> 21:48.741
Brooke?

21:48.775 --> 21:51.378
Brooke, are you out here?

21:55.181 --> 21:56.315
BROOKE (in distance):
Guys!

21:57.450 --> 21:59.018
Help!

22:00.186 --> 22:02.989
Oh. Oh, Brooke.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.323
BROOKE:
Help!

22:09.328 --> 22:11.431
MONTANA:
Brooke, are you out there?

22:11.464 --> 22:12.665
Montana!

22:12.699 --> 22:14.467
I'm over here! Help!

22:14.501 --> 22:15.968
MONTANA:
Brooke!

22:16.002 --> 22:17.303
Montana.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.905
-Oh, Montana!
-How-how the...

22:18.938 --> 22:20.272
did you get up here?

22:20.306 --> 22:23.142
God, please, just get me down
from here. Please!

22:23.175 --> 22:25.011
Don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.680
-Fuck.
-Hurry.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.115
And look out for Rita.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.717
Rita?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.352
She's with Jingles.
She set this whole thing up.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.388
I mean, she's insane.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.491
(grunts)

22:38.525 --> 22:39.859
Damn it!

22:41.528 --> 22:43.696
(Montana grunting)

22:43.730 --> 22:45.364
It won't give.
What should I do?

22:45.398 --> 22:47.400
Go get something sharp,
something to cut this down.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.001
I shouldn't leave you.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.003
No, it's fine. Just go.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.705
Brooke,

22:52.739 --> 22:54.006
you're so brave.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.609
I just want this to be over.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.310
It will be, soon.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.513
I promise.
(exhales)

23:03.416 --> 23:05.652
(whispers):
Okay.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.486
What are you making, Benji?
(chuckles)

23:39.519 --> 23:41.187
A present.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.523
For me?

23:45.391 --> 23:47.794
Just something
to watch over you.

23:48.861 --> 23:49.962
It's a bear.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.532
They're strong, loyal.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.301
They mate for life.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.372
EDDIE:
Oh, my God.

24:00.406 --> 24:01.608
-It's true love.
-(laughs)

24:01.641 --> 24:03.042
-MIDGE: Aw.
-HELEN: Aw, looks like

24:03.075 --> 24:04.544
the two freaks found each other.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.678
(Midge laughing)

24:05.712 --> 24:07.480
-So cute.
-(laughing)

24:11.150 --> 24:13.720
I hate them so much.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.858
They don't deserve
to be here with you.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.693
-(inhales sharply, grunts)
-(Margaret gasps)

24:34.841 --> 24:37.076
Are you my bear, Benji?

24:37.109 --> 24:40.012
I'd do anything to protect you.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.172
(grunts)

25:08.174 --> 25:10.743
VOICES (echoing):
Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.682
MONTANA:
What the hell are you doing?

25:17.149 --> 25:19.018
Seeking guidance from the master

25:19.051 --> 25:20.252
to point me towards the girl.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.254
Your prayers have been answered.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.292
-You found her?
-She's fully helpless.

25:26.325 --> 25:27.860
Good to go.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.429
I need room to work.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.799
There's no way
I'm not watching her die.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.205
Montana?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.140
(grunts)

25:42.875 --> 25:44.176
(footsteps approaching)

25:45.244 --> 25:47.279
(whispers):
Montana?

25:47.313 --> 25:48.981
Montana.

25:57.523 --> 26:00.827
(exhales)
You, little girl,

26:00.860 --> 26:03.763
are as slippery
as a handful of water.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.767
(keys jingling)

26:12.639 --> 26:14.140
RAMIREZ:
Shit. (chuckles)

26:14.173 --> 26:16.175
You really shouldn't have
crashed this party, man.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.543
(Ramirez laughs)

26:17.576 --> 26:19.011
Now I'm gonna have to kill you.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.226
(Ramirez laughs)

26:35.695 --> 26:37.029
A campfire legend

26:37.063 --> 26:38.731
in the goddamn flesh!

26:38.765 --> 26:40.032
(Ramirez panting)

26:40.066 --> 26:42.034
You don't want to do this.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.070
Oh, but I do.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.540
I-I do.
(chuckles)

26:48.574 --> 26:51.377
The blood you've spilled
at this place--

26:51.410 --> 26:52.544
it's eternal.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.546
See, that-that's the thing.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.048
(chuckles softly)

26:56.082 --> 26:57.283
Your reputation's solid.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.118
Set in stone.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.121
And I'm still trying
to build something here.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.723
No matter which way

27:03.756 --> 27:05.257
you slice it,
Mr. Jingles lives forever.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.596
Now it's my turn.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.931
(yells)

27:11.964 --> 27:12.999
(both grunting)

27:14.066 --> 27:16.068
(screams)

27:24.143 --> 27:26.445
I don't know
who the hell you are,

27:26.478 --> 27:28.147
but you sure as shit ain't Rita.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.249
I saw that nurse--
the one you hog-tied

27:30.282 --> 27:32.018
and left in the boathouse.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.487
(both grunting)

27:35.521 --> 27:37.990
(Brooke screaming, whimpering)

27:38.024 --> 27:40.626
(Mr. Jingles
and Ramirez grunting)

27:40.659 --> 27:41.694
Help!

27:42.862 --> 27:44.163
(screaming)

28:08.054 --> 28:11.690
(Brooke screams, whimpers)

28:11.724 --> 28:13.159
-(snarls)
-Aah!

28:13.192 --> 28:14.526
(growls)

28:14.560 --> 28:16.162
(screams)

28:16.195 --> 28:17.563
(whimpers)

28:25.571 --> 28:27.273
You fucking bitch!

28:27.306 --> 28:29.308
(both screaming, grunting)

28:51.898 --> 28:54.666
-(Ramirez grunts)
-(Mr. Jingles screams, groans)

28:54.700 --> 28:56.002
(grunting)

29:00.372 --> 29:01.440
(screams)

29:15.154 --> 29:17.056
(gasps)

29:22.528 --> 29:25.231
(groans)

29:25.264 --> 29:27.699
(keys jingling)

29:33.439 --> 29:34.773
(wood creaking)

29:37.043 --> 29:38.177
MARGARET:
Almighty God,

29:38.210 --> 29:40.847
I am no stranger to your mercy.

29:40.880 --> 29:41.981
14 years ago

29:42.014 --> 29:45.151
I vowed in a baptism of blood

29:45.184 --> 29:47.153
to give you my devotion

29:47.186 --> 29:50.422
and follow
wherever you may lead.

29:50.456 --> 29:51.991
I reopened this camp

29:52.024 --> 29:55.761
to revel in the glory
of your light.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.129
To walk

29:57.163 --> 30:00.466
the straight and narrow path.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.902
But darkness has descended.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.104
Give me the strength

30:05.137 --> 30:07.139
-to do thy will.
-(keys jingling)

30:15.114 --> 30:17.583
Benji?

30:17.616 --> 30:20.619
You're the answer to my prayer.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.397
Why did you come back here?

30:31.430 --> 30:33.032
Finish what I started.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.905
What you started?

30:38.938 --> 30:42.074
Aw, you poor man.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.775
You never had a chance.

30:43.809 --> 30:45.177
MR. JINGLES:
I-It wasn't me.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.578
I didn't hurt them.
(grunts)

30:46.612 --> 30:47.813
Ow!

30:56.989 --> 30:59.025
(whimpering)

31:02.161 --> 31:04.296
(muffled):
It wasn't me.

31:04.330 --> 31:07.033
Of course it was.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.535
You're delusional, Benjamin.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.137
You've lost your sense
of reality.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.704
The things

31:12.738 --> 31:15.307
that you were exposed to
in the jungle...

31:19.745 --> 31:22.248
Your memory can't be trusted.

31:22.281 --> 31:24.416
(machine whirrs)

31:24.450 --> 31:26.452
You may not know what you are...

31:28.087 --> 31:29.521
...but I do.

31:29.555 --> 31:30.822
(whimpers)

31:32.524 --> 31:34.526
-(buzzing)
-(grunting)

31:37.529 --> 31:39.631
(whimpering)

31:42.534 --> 31:44.770
-(buzzing)
-(grunting)

31:47.206 --> 31:50.476
Whatever they did to you,
it made you forget.

31:50.509 --> 31:53.112
No.
You were there.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.114
You saw me.
You told 'em.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.715
I was the killer.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.186
You've forgotten everything,
haven't you?

32:01.787 --> 32:03.990
Like you forgot your promise.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.993
You told me you'd stop them.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.927
You were going to protect me,

32:08.961 --> 32:11.163
but you were too weak.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.732
-(counselors laughing)
-You didn't do a thing.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.201
-(coughing)
-(laughing)

32:15.234 --> 32:17.203
MARGARET:
And they kept at it.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.105
Every day.

32:19.138 --> 32:20.706
-Bullying me.
-(coughing)

32:20.739 --> 32:23.109
Making my life miserable.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.376
Do it.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.145
Oh, no.

32:26.178 --> 32:26.979
Okay. Who am I now?

32:27.013 --> 32:28.947
(clears throat)

32:28.981 --> 32:30.716
-You guys...
-(laughing)

32:30.749 --> 32:32.084
it is 8:30.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.819
Our curfew is 8:00 p.m.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.621
You have to go to sleep.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.189
You don't understand.

32:37.223 --> 32:40.192
I'll be really tired
in the morning.

32:40.226 --> 32:43.229
MARGARET:
So I made it stop.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.775
Margaret.
(pants)

32:56.808 --> 32:57.809
No.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.416
No.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.018
It was me.

33:06.052 --> 33:07.286
The ears from the war.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.121
-That was me.
-Yes.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.423
The stories about you
in Vietnam--

33:11.457 --> 33:14.293
it was too good.
I had to use that.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.995
And I made you
keep your promise.

33:17.029 --> 33:19.498
You finally protected me

33:19.531 --> 33:22.134
when you took the fall.

33:45.991 --> 33:48.827
Do you understand now, Benji?

33:48.860 --> 33:49.828
What happened

33:49.861 --> 33:51.963
in 1970--

33:51.997 --> 33:54.100
it was me.

33:55.234 --> 33:57.969
No.

33:58.003 --> 34:00.038
No, it was me.

34:00.072 --> 34:03.041
It was me.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.046
I tried to put it behind me.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.049
I thought I could come back here
and do some good.

34:11.083 --> 34:14.220
You know, maybe be an example
for the kids, but then...

34:15.487 --> 34:16.855
Well, then you showed up
and made sure

34:16.888 --> 34:18.056
that could never happen.

34:20.459 --> 34:21.760
Do you see now?

34:21.793 --> 34:24.029
Benji, we've come full circle.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.232
You did this.

34:27.699 --> 34:30.035
You told the world
that I was the killer. You...

34:30.068 --> 34:32.404
had me locked away
in that asylum.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.941
I was tortured with electricity,

34:35.974 --> 34:38.577
shot up with drugs

34:38.610 --> 34:40.679
till I believed...

34:40.712 --> 34:42.581
what you said I was.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.883
And now...

34:44.916 --> 34:46.652
you tell me

34:46.685 --> 34:49.221
that I was never that.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.759
Well, fuck you, Margaret.

34:55.894 --> 34:58.230
I am the monster
that you made me.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.708
No.
You were just a guy

35:09.741 --> 35:12.611
who was in the wrong place
at the right time.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.456
-(gunshots in distance)
-What was that?

35:24.490 --> 35:26.458
Margaret.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.060
-She said she had a gun.
-(rustling nearby)

35:29.094 --> 35:31.163
Wait. Shh.
What is that?

35:34.333 --> 35:35.601
-(shouts)
-Whoa!

35:35.634 --> 35:37.603
Oh, Jesus, Montana.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.705
You look fucking gorgeous.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.574
Where have you been?

35:42.608 --> 35:43.575
Looking for Brooke.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.110
We got separated.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.378
Did you hear those gunshots?

35:46.412 --> 35:47.646
Yeah.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.248
I think Margaret's in trouble.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.650
I got to go back for her.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.084
Take Chet.

35:53.118 --> 35:54.019
-(groans)
-He knows where a car is.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.987
I'll meet you guys there, okay?

35:57.723 --> 35:59.325
I'll miss you.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.428
-You look like shit.
-(groans)

36:02.461 --> 36:04.763
Well, I've never felt better.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.098
Okay. Here we go.

36:12.070 --> 36:16.107
You were always so sweet to me.

36:16.141 --> 36:19.878
And now I get to lay my sins
upon you one more time.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.417
(pounding)

36:25.451 --> 36:27.419
TREVOR:
Margaret!

36:27.453 --> 36:30.956
Whoa!
Thank God.

36:30.989 --> 36:33.425
You're okay.

36:36.995 --> 36:40.532
Shit. Shit, you did it.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.000
(chuckles)

36:42.033 --> 36:43.802
You actually killed him.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.971
Right after he killed you.

36:46.004 --> 36:47.205
What?

36:47.239 --> 36:49.207
(grunts)

36:51.042 --> 36:53.011
Oh, that feels so good.

36:53.044 --> 36:56.181
I haven't done that in 14 years.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.416
(grunts)

36:59.585 --> 37:03.021
-(gasping)
-Oh, it's so strange.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.391
Benjamin and I lost sight
of who we really are,

37:05.424 --> 37:08.059
but the balance is now restored.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.396
God has given me the strength

37:10.429 --> 37:12.864
to accept my true self.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.934
-(grunting)
-(chuckles softly)

37:43.128 --> 37:45.130
(keys jingling)

37:55.240 --> 37:56.642
(wheezing)

38:02.581 --> 38:04.883
(grunts)

38:06.318 --> 38:07.653
(groans)

38:10.856 --> 38:13.759
(weakly):
Please.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.628
Please.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.833
It was never me.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.274
BROOKE:
Xavier.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.376
(screams, gasps)

38:30.409 --> 38:32.277
What happened to you?

38:32.310 --> 38:35.113
It was Jingles.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.983
He was j-just here.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.018
Where?

38:41.019 --> 38:43.021
Right here.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.157
Okay, never mind.
We-we have to go.

38:46.191 --> 38:47.158
(explosion in distance)

38:47.192 --> 38:48.660
(gasps)

38:50.429 --> 38:52.431
Come on. Come on.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.535
Come on.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.256
That was our way out.

39:18.289 --> 39:19.290
Where did you go?

39:19.324 --> 39:20.626
I'm so sorry.

39:20.659 --> 39:21.993
I went back to get you,
but you were gone.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.195
Okay.
What happened?

39:25.964 --> 39:27.599
It was on fire when we got here.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.169
It was so awful.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.672
Jingles was attacking me.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.474
I thought I was dead.

39:35.507 --> 39:37.208
And Trevor...

39:37.242 --> 39:40.211
He was so brave.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.114
Jingles killed him.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.229
