16:42.167 --> 16:43.419
Man: YES!

16:43.502 --> 16:46.714
{\an1}OH, NO! IT'S THE TOUGHEST
FAIRY IN THE UNIVERSE--

16:46.797 --> 16:48.924
JORGEN VON STRANGLE!

16:49.007 --> 16:51.385
RIGHT NOW, HE'S DOING
THE VON STRANGLY PART!

16:51.468 --> 16:54.430
{\an5}YOU TWO HAVE CAUSED
A MAJOR MAGICAL
FLUCTUATION

16:54.513 --> 16:56.682
IN THE MAGIC SPACE
CONTINUUM FLUX!

16:56.765 --> 16:58.517
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.393
Jorgen: BECAUSE
OF WHAT YOU DID,

16:59.476 --> 17:01.145
EVERYONE NOW LOOKS
EXACTLY THE SAME,

17:01.228 --> 17:04.690
{\an5}AND NONE
OF THE FAIRIES
CAN FIND THEIR KIDS!

17:04.772 --> 17:07.025
{\an5}DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT'S DOING
TO THE FAIRIES?

17:07.108 --> 17:09.278
OOH! UGH!

17:09.361 --> 17:11.320
{\an1}OH, NO!
MAGICAL BACKUP!

17:11.405 --> 17:14.157
{\an4}THAT ONLY HAPPENS
WHEN FAIRIES CAN'T GRANT
WISHES FOR THEIR KIDS!

17:15.659 --> 17:19.038
HA HA HA! I MEAN--
POOR LITTLE FAIRY.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.038
WE GOT TO FIND TIMMY!

17:20.122 --> 17:24.917
BEFORE ALL
THE FAIRIES...EXPLODE!

17:25.002 --> 17:26.170
NO! YOW!

17:26.252 --> 17:27.963
OH, NO! COSMO!

17:28.047 --> 17:30.966
{\an5}HA! JUST GOOFING
WITH YOU, BABY.
LET'S GO.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.345
{\an5}HEY THERE.
WANT TO PLAY
SOME BLOB-BALL?

17:35.429 --> 17:37.055
I ONLY PLAY
TIMMY-BALL.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.015
WHAT'S A TIMMY?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.309
{\an1}MAN,
THIS WORLD REEKS.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.271
Dr. Bender:
OH, HELLO.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.773
IS THIS YOUR BALL
ON OUR LAWN

17:45.856 --> 17:48.984
AND YOUR GRAY
ON OUR GRAY?

17:49.067 --> 17:50.235
{\an1}HEY, DR. BENDER!
WENDELL!

17:50.319 --> 17:54.573
{\an1}YOU'RE BIG GRAY BLOBS
JUST LIKE ME! HA HA HA!

17:54.656 --> 17:56.825
{\an4}ACTUALLY,
WE'RE THE GRAYEST
AND THE BLOBBIEST.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.661
{\an1}BUT EVERYONE
IS EXACTLY ALIKE!

17:59.745 --> 18:00.287
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE WRONG,

18:00.370 --> 18:03.457
LITTLE NOT-THAT-GRAY BOY.

18:03.540 --> 18:07.753
{\an4}IN FACT, ONLY BLOBS
AS GRAY AND BLOBBY
AS WE ARE

18:07.836 --> 18:11.006
{\an1}CAN HAVE A GRAY BALL
AS FUN AS THIS.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.758
NOW, BEAT IT!

18:12.841 --> 18:14.134
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

18:14.218 --> 18:15.427
EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD'S
EXACTLY ALIKE,

18:15.511 --> 18:19.056
{\an4}AND THOSE CREEPS STILL
THINK THEY'RE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE!

18:19.139 --> 18:20.516
{\an1}GOT TO GET COSMO
AND WANDA TO FIND ME

18:20.599 --> 18:23.352
SO I CAN UNWISH THIS WISH!
THERE'S NO TIME TO WASTE!

18:27.856 --> 18:30.108
TIMMY?

18:27.856 --> 18:30.108
CHET.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.735
TIMMY?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.735
CHET!

18:31.819 --> 18:34.404
NOW ARE YOU TIMMY?

18:34.488 --> 18:37.115
{\an1}OH, NO!
MAGIC BUILDUP!

18:37.199 --> 18:39.701
I'M NOT FALLING
FOR THAT ONE AGAIN.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.371
{\an1}HEY!
IT'S RAINING ME!

18:42.454 --> 18:46.875
{\an5}OH, IF I EXPLODE,
WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FIND TIMMY!

18:46.959 --> 18:50.295
{\an4}Timmy: GOT TO FIND
SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE
COSMO AND WANDA NOTICE ME.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.548
GRAY, GRAY, GRAY...

18:52.631 --> 18:53.966
{\an1}WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR, SWEETIE?

18:54.049 --> 18:54.967
DO WE HAVE A MARKER
AND SOME PAPER?

18:55.050 --> 18:57.052
I NEED TO MAKE
A POSTER.

18:57.135 --> 18:58.387
OH, SURE, HON.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.766
YEAH. THAT'S VIBRANT
AND NOTICEABLE.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.561
{\an1}I'M HOME AND GRAY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY, DEAR?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.604
GRAY!

19:07.688 --> 19:08.564
BUT I HAD
JUST ENOUGH TIME

19:08.647 --> 19:12.442
{\an5}TO MAKE MY LOVELY
GRAY FLAMINGO
CASSEROLE.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.777
THAT'S GRAY--T!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.153
{\an1}HA HA HA!

19:13.861 --> 19:15.153
HA HA HA!

19:15.237 --> 19:17.406
{\an1}Timmy: JEEZ. MY PARENTS
MIGHT BE GRAY BLOBS

19:17.489 --> 19:18.490
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,

19:18.574 --> 19:19.575
{\an1}BUT THEY'RE STILL
THEIR GOOFY SELVES,

19:19.658 --> 19:22.035
WHICH MEANS...

19:23.120 --> 19:25.914
OH, NO! PINK!

19:25.998 --> 19:26.915
{\an1}HA HA HA!

19:25.998 --> 19:26.915
HA HA HA!

19:26.999 --> 19:28.166
MOM STILL CAN'T COOK!

19:28.250 --> 19:29.585
{\an1}THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE STILL GOOFY

19:29.668 --> 19:31.128
{\an1}AND BENDER
IS STILL A JERK!

19:31.211 --> 19:33.839
{\an1}I CHANGED THEIR OUTSIDES,
NOT THEIR INSIDES!

19:33.922 --> 19:35.465
{\an1}MOM, CAN I HAVE YOUR
HIDEOUS PINK CASSEROLE?

19:35.549 --> 19:37.426
SURE!

19:37.509 --> 19:38.427
{\an1}THERE'S NO TIME
TO LOSE!

19:43.056 --> 19:44.474
IF I CHANGE MY OUTSIDE,

19:44.558 --> 19:46.393
{\an1}THEN COSMO AND WANDA
CAN FIND ME.

19:46.476 --> 19:46.977
I HOPE.

19:47.060 --> 19:50.314
COSMO! WANDA! IT'S ME...

19:50.397 --> 19:53.108
{\an1}WITH MY PINK HAT!
I'M DIFFERENT!

19:53.192 --> 19:54.651
LOOK! DIFFERENT!

19:54.735 --> 19:57.613
{\an1}HEY! WHO'S THE FREAK
WITH THE PINK ON HIS HEAD?

19:57.696 --> 20:00.032
{\an1}LET'S GET HIM
AND GRAY HIM UP!

20:00.991 --> 20:03.577
I CAN'T FIND TIMMY
ANYWHERE,

20:03.660 --> 20:05.120
AND...UH-OH!

20:05.203 --> 20:07.873
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
ALL EXPLODY!

20:10.125 --> 20:13.837
COSMO! WANDA!
IT'S ME! TIMMY!

20:13.921 --> 20:15.881
{\an1}I SEE A LITTLE
PINK DOT!

20:15.964 --> 20:18.425
THAT'S OUR LITTLE
PINK DOT!

20:18.508 --> 20:18.800
YOU FOUND ME!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.886
OF COURSE.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.095
{\an1}YOU STICK OUT LIKE
A BIG, SORE, PINK THUMB.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.848
{\an1}UH, LESS TALKY,
MORE WISHY!

20:24.932 --> 20:25.807
I WISH I WAS
DIFFERENT AGAIN.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.892
I WISH THE WHOLE WORLD
WAS BACK TO THE WAY

20:26.975 --> 20:29.311
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!

20:41.907 --> 20:45.494
{\an1}MY TEETH! MY HEAD!
MY HAT! MY GOSH!

20:45.577 --> 20:46.662
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

20:46.745 --> 20:48.830
JUST MAKE
ANOTHER WISH.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.834
[ALL SIGH]

20:52.918 --> 20:54.461
{\an1}WHAT'S THE MATTER,
TIMMY?

20:54.544 --> 20:55.712
{\an1}WHY AREN'T YOU
AND YOUR FRIENDS

20:55.796 --> 20:57.798
{\an1}HITTING EACH OTHER
IN THE HEAD WITH YOUR BALL?

20:57.881 --> 20:59.257
{\an1}AW, THAT CREEP DENTIST
DOWN THE STREET

20:59.341 --> 21:00.676
WON'T GIVE ME
MY BALL BACK

21:00.759 --> 21:02.344
{\an1}BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
LIKE MY TEETH.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.512
OH, REALLY?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.555
{\an4}WELL, LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN REASON
WITH HIM.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.894
Dr. Bender: NOW GO,
OTHER BAD-TOOTHED BOY

21:10.978 --> 21:13.855
AND NEVER DARKEN
OUR DOORWAY AGAIN

21:13.939 --> 21:16.608
WITH YOUR HORRIBLE
BITE RADIUS.

21:16.692 --> 21:19.152
HERE'S YOUR NEW
BOOMERANG, WENDELL.

21:19.236 --> 21:24.199
{\an5}HA HA! THIS SURE
IS A FUN BOOMERANG
THAT'S MINE NOW!

21:24.282 --> 21:25.409
HA HA!

21:25.492 --> 21:26.827
[WHISTLE]

21:26.910 --> 21:28.453
GIVE ME BACK
MY BALL, WENDELL.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.372
WHAT'S THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?

21:30.455 --> 21:32.124
OH, YEAH.<i> NO!</i>

21:32.207 --> 21:33.959
HA HA HA!

21:32.207 --> 21:33.959
HA HA HA!

21:34.042 --> 21:35.836
YOU MUST BE
DR. BENDER,

21:35.919 --> 21:37.504
{\an1}AND THAT MUST BE
TIMMY'S BALL.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.880
MAY WE HAVE IT BACK?

21:38.964 --> 21:43.802
{\an5}IN THIS ORDER--
RIGHT, RIGHT, AND NO,
MAMA TOOTH-FACE.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.847
{\an4}WELL, YOU CLEARLY
DON'T KNOW THE RULES
OF TIMMY-BALL.

21:46.930 --> 21:48.098
OH?

21:46.930 --> 21:48.098
OH?

21:48.181 --> 21:49.891
{\an1}THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU PLAY IT LIKE THIS.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.102
[CRASH]

21:52.185 --> 21:54.688
{\an4}YOU KNOW, TIMMY.
PERFECT TEETH
MIGHT BE NICE,

21:54.771 --> 21:56.732
{\an1}BUT IF THEY'RE
IN A MOUTH THAT'S MEAN,

21:56.815 --> 21:59.609
{\an1}THEY MIGHT AS WELL
NOT BE IN THE MOUTH AT ALL.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.903
{\an4}THANKS, MOM.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU JUST SAID,

22:01.987 --> 22:03.739
{\an1}BUT IT SURE MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.325
{\an1}MY DENTURES! GIVE ME BACK
MY PERFECT TEETH!

22:07.409 --> 22:07.993
JUMP BALL. COME ON.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.787
YOU WANT IT?
WORK FOR IT.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.789
AND, DUDE, YOU LEFT
THESE AT MY HOUSE.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.000
AAH!

22:15.083 --> 22:17.753
THOSE DON'T
BELONG IN THERE!

22:17.836 --> 22:19.671
WHO WANTS TO PLAY
TIMMY-BALL?

22:19.755 --> 22:20.922
All: UH, WELL, I...

22:21.006 --> 22:23.592
{\an5}UHH!

22:21.006 --> 22:23.592
OUCH!

22:21.006 --> 22:23.592
OOH!

22:23.675 --> 22:24.968
All: AAH!

22:25.052 --> 22:27.554
{\an1}HEY, CUT IT OUT!
NO FAIR! I'M HAIRLESS!

22:27.637 --> 22:29.139
Mom: OH, COME ON,
YOU GUYS.

22:29.222 --> 22:29.931
WHERE'S YOUR
GAME FACE?

22:30.015 --> 22:31.058
BRING IT ON.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.560
IS THERE
A MESSAGE THERE?

22:33.643 --> 22:34.644
I THINK IT'S THIS.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.772
{\an1}IF YOU'RE PLAYING
TIMMY-BALL, WEAR A HELMET.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.023
WHAT ABOUT
WANDA-BALL?

22:38.106 --> 22:39.608
I KNOW THAT GAME!

22:39.691 --> 22:41.610
DID YOU KNOW I USE
A CINDER BLOCK?

22:41.693 --> 22:43.445
{\an1}DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
AAH!

22:43.528 --> 22:45.447
Wanda: COME ON.
BRING IT ON, MEAT.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.407
I GOT YOUR GAME
RIGHT HERE.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.076
OH, IS THAT ALL
YOU GOT? COME ON.
