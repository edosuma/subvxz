Who made that?

My dad.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.326
That's a lot of people to take care of.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.753
I don't know.

Fuck the glory?

38:58.128 --> 39:00.213
So what's the plan tonight, champ?

No, you did great.

56:37.185 --> 56:39.855
You were tired when you came in.
You had a long day, right?

<i>In the end,
I am responsible for my training</i>

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.631

<i>You need to sacrifice yourself
and have the desire to be a champion.</i>

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:21.676

work, work hard, work, work.

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:42.608
Right.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:46.980
This fight was meant to happen.
Know what I mean?

01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:50.734
No matter what I could have did wrong,
what I could have did right.

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:53.403
It was all supposed to happen
the way that it did.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:54.487
Right.

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:57.282
It's all part of your story.

01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:00.410
Walk out of here smiling.

01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:23.100
