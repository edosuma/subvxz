34:31.068 --> 34:35.697
- Aloha from Hawaii,
Captain Man.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.743
- Well well, Doctor Minyak.

34:38.826 --> 34:41.579
- Wh--how is he alive?!?

34:41.661 --> 34:43.080
We watched him jump outta
that cargo plane

34:43.164 --> 34:44.873
without a parachute

34:44.956 --> 34:46.167
- Cargo plane?
- Hello?!?

34:46.250 --> 34:50.045
Hello?!? Hello?!?

34:50.129 --> 34:51.464
- What do you want, Minyak?

34:51.547 --> 34:52.840
- Oh, not much.

34:52.924 --> 34:56.094
I just thought that since
I'm here, relaxing in Hawaii,

34:56.177 --> 34:59.472
I'd tell you
about my newest plan.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.182
- What plan?

35:01.265 --> 35:02.892
- Mm! Well, I'm
sure you've heard

35:02.975 --> 35:05.061
of this popular celebrity,
Double G.

35:05.144 --> 35:09.232
- Hey! That's my dad!
I'm Triple G!

35:09.315 --> 35:11.943
- Uh, I'm kinda in the middle
of a meeting right now,

35:12.026 --> 35:15.613
{\an5}with some people that want
to make a video game about me.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.740
So, you wanna tell me
about your plan or not?

35:17.824 --> 35:20.284
- Of course I do!

35:20.368 --> 35:23.329
That's why I'm
calling you from Hawaii.

35:23.412 --> 35:25.873
Oh!!!

35:25.957 --> 35:28.751
- I think your Hawaii fell down.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.380
[ humming ]

35:32.463 --> 35:35.007
- Yeah, I don't think
he's in Hawaii.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.968
- Now, perhaps you've heard

35:37.051 --> 35:39.220
that Double G's
giving a huge concert,

35:39.303 --> 35:40.388
for charity, in New York City.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.306
- Yeah, everybody
knows about that. So?

35:42.390 --> 35:45.226
- Well, that charity concert
is not going to happen!

35:45.309 --> 35:49.021
Because I,
Doctor Horatio T. Minyak,

35:49.105 --> 35:51.691
am going to stop it!
Via sabotage!

35:51.774 --> 35:54.819
And there's nothing that you
or that punk Kid Danger

35:54.902 --> 35:57.530
can do about it!
Ha!!!

35:57.613 --> 35:59.115
Mahalo!

36:00.658 --> 36:01.826
- Oh my god.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.995
- Who was that mean man?!?

36:04.078 --> 36:05.580
- Doctor Minyak.

36:07.331 --> 36:11.752
Uh, is what--
is what they called him...

36:11.836 --> 36:13.170
on the news.

36:15.339 --> 36:16.549
- Well, what's that freak
got against my dad?!?

36:16.632 --> 36:19.135
- Don't worry about Minyak.
His plans never work.

36:19.218 --> 36:23.848
- Well, what if this plan--
- Shhh.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.767
Now, this mobile game
you're going to make about me.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.937
Imagine me, Captain Man,

36:30.021 --> 36:32.023
fighting giant, moon robots

36:32.106 --> 36:35.318
with my sidekick
a female chihuahua.

36:38.195 --> 36:40.197
- I love it.
- I like it.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.616
- Yeah, great idea. Yes.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.201
- I think it'll fly
right off the shelves.

36:46.954 --> 36:50.166
- [ muttering ]

36:55.254 --> 36:56.255
- Uh, Babe
- Hm?

36:56.339 --> 36:58.674
- Are you sniffing
Henry's pillow?

36:58.758 --> 37:01.886
- Mm...yes.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.808
[ whimpering ]

37:07.892 --> 37:09.143
- Okay, Trip,

37:09.226 --> 37:11.354
I don't think you're
helping anything

37:11.437 --> 37:15.358
by walking back and forth
and going, [ whimpers ].

37:17.485 --> 37:19.487
- Well, I'm worried
about my dad!

37:19.570 --> 37:23.491
I mean, we don't know anything
about that guy, Doctor Maniac.

37:27.286 --> 37:29.872
- Minyak.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.624
- Well, whatever his name is,

37:31.707 --> 37:33.668
I don't want him messing up
my dad's concert.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.170
- Uh, you guys?

37:36.253 --> 37:38.172
You think it's cool if I have
some of Henry's bubble gum?

37:38.255 --> 37:40.758
- Yeah, whatever.
- Who really cares?

37:40.841 --> 37:41.926
- Anyway, you can relax,

37:42.009 --> 37:43.511
'cuz now we know Captain Man.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.845
{\an5}- Yeah, Captain Man's
not gonna let anything bad

37:44.929 --> 37:46.389
happen to your father.

37:46.472 --> 37:50.351
- But my dad's in New York,
not here in Swellview.

37:50.434 --> 37:52.645
I--I better go back home
and keep an eye on him.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.772
- No no no no no!
- No sir.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.440
- Nooo, the four of us came all
the way here

37:56.524 --> 38:00.277
so we could focus and
figure out a new game to make.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.696
- Yeah riiight.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.115
All you two wanna "focus" on
is "handsome Henry."

38:04.198 --> 38:06.033
- Oh what?
- Aw, seriously?

38:06.117 --> 38:07.952
- Oh you mean these two?

38:08.035 --> 38:09.662
The smitten kittens?

38:12.289 --> 38:13.374
- Hey hey.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.959
Piper said you needed towels?

38:15.042 --> 38:17.712
- Oh Henry, you're so sweet
to bring us towels.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.506
- Yeah, they look
so soft and fluffy.

38:20.589 --> 38:24.218
- We love the towels.

38:24.301 --> 38:26.470
- Well, here they are.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.747
- Noooooo!!!

39:23.319 --> 39:24.862
- I don't...
- Wha--

39:24.945 --> 39:26.530
- What?

39:26.614 --> 39:29.408
Is there gum stuck on my face?

39:29.492 --> 39:32.703
OHHH SH'WHOA!

39:32.787 --> 39:35.039
WHOA!

39:35.122 --> 39:37.541
- Okay, how did Hudson
get dressed like Kid Danger?!?

39:37.625 --> 39:40.628
- It happened when
he blew a bubble!

39:40.711 --> 39:45.591
- With Henry's
oddly glowing gum.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.135
- Whoa man.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.306
- I'm Kid Danger?!?

39:52.389 --> 39:55.810
- No!!!
Henry is Kid Danger.

39:57.895 --> 39:58.604
- Me?

39:58.687 --> 40:01.398
- And the hot get hotter.

40:03.317 --> 40:07.154
- Yeah...yeah.
Uh...hm?

40:07.238 --> 40:10.199
Oh me? Kid Da--
Uh--What?

40:10.282 --> 40:11.826
No! What?
No, I'm--

40:11.909 --> 40:13.702
{\an5}I'm just as confused
as you guys.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.496
Oh my god!
This is cra-

40:16.914 --> 40:20.584
- Hehehehe.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.006
- Oh m'god!
Oh my god!

40:26.090 --> 40:28.717
Ohh...Oh.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.469
- Okay, here are some
extra pillows--

40:33.222 --> 40:36.142
- Okay, okay.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.435
Piper did not deserve that.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.740
- Ahhhhhh!
C'mon! You guys!

40:51.824 --> 40:54.326
Put me back together!

40:54.410 --> 40:55.536
- No no, Schwoz--

40:55.619 --> 40:57.204
you wanted to show
us a magic trick,

40:57.288 --> 40:59.290
so now you gotta finish it.
Right, Bork?

40:59.373 --> 41:01.876
[ laughing ]

41:01.959 --> 41:04.920
- But I forgot how
to re-attach myself!

41:05.004 --> 41:06.505
- Henry! Help me!

41:06.589 --> 41:08.174
- No! No!
I can't, man.

41:08.257 --> 41:09.884
I got somethin'
goin' on right now.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.552
- All right, that's it.

41:11.635 --> 41:14.513
Bork, take the half of Schwoz
that has a mouth outta here.

41:17.349 --> 41:19.727
- Ahh, no.
No, no, nooo wait, wait!

41:19.810 --> 41:21.395
Wait, you have to take my feet!
No! No!

41:21.478 --> 41:26.233
Stay alive!
I will find you!

41:32.698 --> 41:34.658
- Hey, Henry, who's in the--

41:36.785 --> 41:39.830
Hey, aren't those
the Game Shaker kids?

41:39.914 --> 41:43.584
- Okay, now don't get mad.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.252
- Uh, Henry, they're waking up!

41:45.336 --> 41:48.214
- What? Oh shhh-arlotte!
Open the elevator door!

41:48.297 --> 41:50.090
- Ah geez.
- Go! C'mon! Go! Go!

42:01.268 --> 42:03.103
- Uh, what's going on?

42:03.187 --> 42:06.148
- Hey, why don't we all
go have some hot chocolate?

42:06.232 --> 42:09.109
- Could we?
- Henry!

42:09.193 --> 42:10.319
- Hey let us out!
- Hello?!?

42:10.402 --> 42:11.987
- C'mon, open up!

42:13.530 --> 42:15.157
- The...
The Hudson kid--

42:15.241 --> 42:16.533
he found my gum
and he blew a bubble!

42:16.617 --> 42:17.993
- Oh no no no!!!

42:18.077 --> 42:22.331
- Then, and then he turned into,
y'know, like me!

42:22.414 --> 42:23.707
- And everybody saw it?!?!?

42:23.791 --> 42:25.251
{\an5}- Yes yes, they all saw man,
they all saw.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.253
and then,
and then that that Kenzie girl

42:27.336 --> 42:29.463
she figured out
that I'm Kid Danger

42:29.547 --> 42:30.798
- Oh my god.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.967
- And then--and then
I-I freaked out.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.134
I freaked out, man!
I freaked out.

42:34.218 --> 42:38.138
And then...I just,
I just...

42:39.473 --> 42:40.307
- You just what?

42:40.391 --> 42:42.726
- I just started zapping.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.687
And I just, I-I couldn't stop.
I zapped everyone.

42:44.770 --> 42:48.023
And then--
then I zapped my sister!

42:50.067 --> 42:51.568
I zapped my sister man!

42:57.825 --> 42:59.076
- Ohhh.

43:04.373 --> 43:06.959
Wh-what happened?

43:08.210 --> 43:10.671
HENRY: "Piper uh,
you fell asleep,

43:10.754 --> 43:13.841
so the Game Shaker kids
decided to take a uh,

43:13.924 --> 43:18.470
a pajama hike.
Yeah. Pajama hike.

43:18.554 --> 43:20.472
And they probably
won't ever come back.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.850
Hopefully, they paid you
in advance.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.021
Believe in your dreams.
Henry."

43:27.104 --> 43:29.982
- If he only knew my dreams.

43:38.490 --> 43:41.660
- Hello!
- Open the door!

43:41.744 --> 43:42.494
- All right, Kid.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.205
Time to clean up your mess.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.292
- C'mon man--do we really have
to erase their memories?

43:48.375 --> 43:49.752
- Yes! Now turn
the elevator power back on

43:49.835 --> 43:51.086
and open the door.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.964
- Let us out!
- Don't be like this!

43:59.428 --> 44:02.514
- Ahhh, okay.
- Owww, oh that's bright

44:02.598 --> 44:06.226
- Oh, the light
- Are we in heaven?

44:09.396 --> 44:11.190
- Hey kids!

44:13.108 --> 44:15.402
- Hello, everyone.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.196
- Hey.
- Hi.

44:17.279 --> 44:18.572
- Who's?

44:18.655 --> 44:21.241
- Oh! Uh...

44:21.325 --> 44:23.869
My name is
Daenerys Targaryen.

44:26.288 --> 44:29.416
And pretend I'm not here.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.878
- I...

44:32.961 --> 44:34.922
- Wh-what happened to us?

44:35.005 --> 44:37.216
- What is this place?

44:37.299 --> 44:38.258
- Hi everyone!

44:38.342 --> 44:40.219
Welcome to The Man Cave.

44:40.302 --> 44:43.430
Uh, now if you kids'll look
this way, please toward me,

44:43.514 --> 44:46.266
I'm just gonna use this

44:46.350 --> 44:49.561
to take a pic a'you guys.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.146
- Oh yeah!
That's a great idea,

44:51.230 --> 44:53.482
c'mon everyone,
let's get in close.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.235
- All right.
Here we go.

44:56.318 --> 44:59.113
One--
- All right, stop it!

44:59.196 --> 45:01.490
If we're gonna wipe
their memories,

45:01.573 --> 45:03.075
we should at least
have the guts to tell 'em!

45:03.158 --> 45:05.119
- Wipe our memories?
- What are you- Wait, what?

45:05.202 --> 45:06.745
- Naaaahhhh, it's fine.
It's fine.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.288
It's just a camera

45:08.372 --> 45:09.873
Heh, with a trigger.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.458
Okay, everyone smile
and say "amnesia".

45:11.542 --> 45:12.835
- What?
- Amnesia???

45:12.918 --> 45:13.627
- He's gonna wipe our memories!

45:13.710 --> 45:17.589
- Wait!!!
Wait um...

45:17.673 --> 45:19.466
If-if you wipe our memories,

45:19.550 --> 45:22.302
we won't be able to make
the cool game about you.

45:22.386 --> 45:24.972
- Yeah, and we had
all those amazing ideas.

45:25.055 --> 45:26.974
- I know, too bad, right?
- Really good.

45:27.057 --> 45:30.644
- Wait, wait, like,
like what ideas?

45:30.727 --> 45:32.146
- Y'know, stuff like,

45:32.229 --> 45:33.856
{\an5}you, Captain Man,
and Kid Danger.

45:33.939 --> 45:37.234
Traveling through time,
fighting moon-moon robots

45:37.317 --> 45:39.903
- Uh, y-y-yeah, big,
scary moon robots!

45:39.987 --> 45:42.531
- And other villains
from history.

45:42.614 --> 45:44.324
- AND from the future.

45:44.408 --> 45:47.786
- Ah, so like
a time-travel angle.

45:47.870 --> 45:49.621
- Yeah, yeah!
And we'll call it um...

45:49.705 --> 45:51.582
- Uh, we'll we'll call it uh...

45:51.665 --> 45:53.250
- Crime Warp!

45:53.333 --> 45:55.127
- Yes! Crime Warp!
That's definitely the name.

45:55.210 --> 45:58.172
- Crime Warp

45:58.255 --> 45:59.882
- This game sounds
pretty sick, dude.

45:59.965 --> 46:01.633
{\an5}- Yeah, I know, shut up
shut up shut up shut up.

46:01.717 --> 46:03.010
- But...

46:03.093 --> 46:04.720
we can't make games
without our memories.

46:04.803 --> 46:07.848
- It's simple biology.

46:07.931 --> 46:10.517
- Hey, whose feet are these?

46:10.601 --> 46:13.562
- Ha ha, hey, quit that!

46:13.645 --> 46:18.567
Hahahahaaa ho ho

46:20.110 --> 46:22.029
[ alarm buzzes ]

46:22.112 --> 46:24.239
- Uh, what's that?
- Breaking news.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.992
- Go check it out.

46:27.075 --> 46:29.244
Please.
- There ya go.

46:32.664 --> 46:35.042
- There was trouble
tonight in New York City.

46:35.125 --> 46:37.377
{\an8}- Also known as: The Big Pear.
