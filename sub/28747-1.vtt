00:12.546 --> 00:16.682
( cows mooing )

00:16.684 --> 00:19.518
<i>( music playing )</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:30.195
Man: <i>There is an unholy spell
upon this village.</i>

00:33.067 --> 00:36.769
<i>Our foolish greed
has dimmed our past</i>

00:36.771 --> 00:39.238
<i>and darkened our future.</i>

00:41.175 --> 00:44.543
Yet there is nothing
to be done about it.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.180
No one marries now
in Piano.

00:48.182 --> 00:52.051
No one falls in love,

00:52.053 --> 00:54.520
or even dares to.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.592
<i>Last night,
as he lay dying,</i>

01:00.594 --> 01:03.429
the old man confessed
what he knew

01:03.431 --> 01:05.731
<i>and what he tried to do</i>

01:05.733 --> 01:08.434
<i>to rid us of this curse,</i>

01:08.436 --> 01:11.637
<i>that gypsy spell he wove.</i>

01:11.639 --> 01:16.642
I can bury a man,
but not his sins.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.210
Whoa!

01:18.212 --> 01:21.346
<i>( music playing )</i>

01:24.318 --> 01:26.752
( phone ringing )

01:26.754 --> 01:29.455
Tyler Hutton's office.
Yes, of course.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.590
I'll tell him immediately.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.594
Tyler?

01:41.435 --> 01:44.269
Hey, Tyler,
your dad wants you.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.175
Are you okay?

01:50.177 --> 01:53.879
Well, they finally came in.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.415
The divorce papers,
they're so official looking.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.549
Look.

02:01.856 --> 02:05.524
I'm really sorry, Tyler.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.793
Okay, no, I'm not.
I'm glad, actually.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.294
And you should be, too.
Megan treated you like--

02:13.234 --> 02:15.334
So did you win?

02:15.336 --> 02:19.505
She got the business,
what's left of it.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.773
And she got the car.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.676
The nice one, too.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.179
And she got the cat.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.681
To be honest,
I hated that cat.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.217
He's waiting.
Move it.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.391
Man: What do you
think of this hemline?

02:39.393 --> 02:41.193
Go for it.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.829
And this?

02:43.831 --> 02:46.465
- Good.
- Okay.

02:46.467 --> 02:50.736
Okay, everybody,
thank you. Out. Out!

02:50.738 --> 02:54.940
Bye. Sorry, guys. Sorry.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.480
- What happened to you?
- Pinched nerve.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.615
Have a seat, Tyler.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.921
I can't fly,
so I've decided to send you.

03:08.923 --> 03:13.492
To Milan. It's just a quick
check on the new spring lines.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.078
By the way,
you look like hell.

03:16.079 --> 03:18.663
- Thank you so much.
- Handbags and boots.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.832
You won't have to place
any orders. I'll do that.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.336
You leave tomorrow.
Marta has your travel arrangements.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.727
- Questions?
- Yeah.

03:25.728 --> 03:27.117
You know, you might want
to send somebody

03:27.118 --> 03:28.507
that's a little more
up to speed on handbags.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.676
Look at me, Tyler.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.911
How did a bed and breakfast
look good to you on paper?

03:32.913 --> 03:36.381
Do we have to go through this again?
I told you I made a mistake.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.584
Why do you have to keep rubbing
it in my face all the time?

03:38.586 --> 03:41.587
Because I don't want you to
forget the smell of failure.

03:41.589 --> 03:45.324
Look, Tyler, I know I'm partly
to blame for the way things are,

03:45.326 --> 03:46.592
but if your mother
hadn't poisoned--

03:46.594 --> 03:48.293
She didn't poison anything.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.495
We might've gotten
to know each other better.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.531
But that ship has sailed.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.401
What matters now is that you're
exactly where you need to be,

03:56.403 --> 03:57.736
learning how to run
this company.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.971
You just have
some catching up to do.

03:58.973 --> 04:01.640
When did I ever say

04:01.642 --> 04:03.008
that I wanted to run
this company?

04:03.010 --> 04:06.445
You had your dreams, Tyler.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.613
And what did they get you?

04:07.615 --> 04:10.649
A messy,
expensive divorce,

04:10.651 --> 04:14.019
chapter 11, and that--
that stinking cat.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.954
I didn't even get the cat.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.589
Don't piss
this chance away, son.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.559
You are gonna be very,
very successful.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.661
And when you are,
you're gonna thank me

04:22.663 --> 04:25.797
for kicking your butt
when you needed it.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.533
Just get on that plane
and hit the ground running.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.269
Got it?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.941
- Got it.
- Bravo.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.809
Gonna do it your way.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.315
What have I got to lose?

04:43.317 --> 04:45.417
( groans )

04:46.487 --> 04:48.287
You've got everything to lose.

04:48.289 --> 04:51.490
Just a couple of details,
Tyler.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.059
First, window or aisle?

05:10.477 --> 05:13.011
( chatter, laughter )

05:14.515 --> 05:17.716
( bell tolling )

05:20.487 --> 05:22.954
Paolo:
You look tired.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.023
Are you sure
you don't wish to rest?

05:25.024 --> 05:27.091
No, let's eat.
Let's talk business.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.628
I like to hit the ground
running.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.697
Driver,
Trattoria Del Vecchio.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.733
( indistinct chatter )

05:34.735 --> 05:36.768
And for you, sir?

05:36.770 --> 05:38.737
Uh, what's good here?

05:38.738 --> 05:40.705
May I suggest
the risotto Milanese

05:40.708 --> 05:43.975
or perhaps
the veal Milanese?

05:43.977 --> 05:46.111
- We'll do both.
- Yeah.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.679
Gentlemen, I'm so sorry.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.781
Traffic was
an absolute nightmare.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.882
<i>Scusami,</i> Paolo.
Mr. Hudson, I'm Hugo Galante.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.852
Nice to meet you.
Uh, Tyler. Tyler is fine.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.721
Have a seat.
So, what are we having to drink?

05:55.723 --> 05:58.657
Do you want some wine?
Red wine? It's killer.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.376
Red wine is perfect, thanks.

06:00.377 --> 06:02.094
- Yeah.
- Absolutely fine, thanks.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.997
You see this thing?
What is that? You know?

06:04.998 --> 06:07.899
- It's, like, where are we?
- It keeps making me want to go to the toilet.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.067
That's weird.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.071
Sorry.

06:18.679 --> 06:22.881
Mm, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to disagree with you guys.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.616
I think that social media
is great and all that...

06:24.618 --> 06:26.418
( belches )
but you really have to think

06:26.420 --> 06:28.620
about the full-page
magazine ads.

06:28.622 --> 06:32.023
I mean, glossy things.
That-- that's what sets fashion apart.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.658
Yet your father's approach
was quite the opp--

06:33.660 --> 06:36.995
( groans )
My father.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.598
- Was quite the opposite.
- ( chuckles )

06:39.600 --> 06:42.167
He was always very quick
to embrace new technologies,

06:42.169 --> 06:44.870
and he's done fairly well
in this billion-euro industry.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.106
Well, my father isn't here,
is he? He's not around.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.742
Look, I'll look
at your stuff tomorrow.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.779
And if I like what I see,
I'm in.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.781
Does anybody want
another round?

06:55.782 --> 06:57.782
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.153
No, it's my pleasure.
Don't worry about it.

07:01.155 --> 07:05.123
- It's not like I'm paying for it.
- ( laughing )

07:05.125 --> 07:07.793
To the old man. Pops!

07:07.795 --> 07:10.929
Mm, you know what
I really want to see?

07:10.931 --> 07:13.999
I want to see boots
with a purpose.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.969
Yeah. I'm talking about
actual boots.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.807
Riding boots, cowboy boots.
Man, I'm talking about authentic boots.

07:21.809 --> 07:25.043
That's what I want to see.
It's gotta have life, purpose.

07:25.045 --> 07:30.515
It's gotta mean something.
Am I right?

07:30.517 --> 07:32.717
- Aw, come on, hey?
- Mm-mm.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.155
Whoo.
That tastes like purpose.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.025
Can you believe this guy?

07:40.027 --> 07:44.830
( speaking Italian )

07:44.832 --> 07:47.132
Good night!

07:47.134 --> 07:50.502
- Crying out loud.
- ( laughing )

07:50.504 --> 07:54.606
Hey, man. Come on.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.775
- Door's deceptively transparent.
- No, you did that.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.109
That wasn't there
when I walked in.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.811
- It was there.
- It wasn't there.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.213
- It was--
- ( thud )

08:01.215 --> 08:04.516
- Steady, steady.
- Okay, hey.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.151
How much further is it?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.785
It's really easy.
It's just right--

08:07.788 --> 08:09.888
it's right around the corner,
I told you.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.723
So we'll talk
some business tomorrow.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.325
Come pick you up, yeah? Hmm?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.926
Maybe we should
just get him a taxi, eh?

08:14.927 --> 08:16.527
No, no. There's--
we don't need a taxi.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.614
I told you. We don't have to do that.
I'm right here.

08:18.615 --> 08:20.699
I told you it's right--
it's-- no, no, no.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.001
No, no, no.
You guys are idiots.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.936
It's over there.
( laughing )

08:24.938 --> 08:27.105
- You sure?
- Yeah, no, I'm-- I'm--

08:27.107 --> 08:29.174
It's-- I'm fine. I'm good.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.009
I'll take it from here.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.613
- Boots! Authentic boots.
- Boots.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.182
He got his dad's looks.
He didn't get the brains.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.518
There, that's him.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.988
Mr. Tyler?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.656
Come with us, please.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.191
No, I'm okay.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.193
I don't need a taxi.
Hey, hey, hey!

08:48.195 --> 08:49.561
- Come on!
- Ow!

08:49.563 --> 08:52.731
( shouting in Italian )

08:52.733 --> 08:54.900
Wait! What's going on? Help!

08:54.902 --> 08:57.602
- Hey! Hey! Help!
- Shut up!

08:57.604 --> 08:59.738
You think maybe we should
have gotten him a taxi?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.172
He'll be all right.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.208
- Faster!
- ( moaning )

09:03.210 --> 09:06.678
Shut up or you go
in the boot!

09:06.680 --> 09:09.114
- Shut!
- What is it with boots?

09:09.116 --> 09:12.751
- Bambo, take A-4.
- Do you have any idea who I am? Ow!

09:12.753 --> 09:14.686
We only know
what we need to know.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.956
That really hurt.
That hurt my face.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.191
- And it hurt my neck.
- ( grumbling )

09:20.193 --> 09:26.064
- ( speaking Italian )
- ( muffled whimpering )

09:28.802 --> 09:30.702
- ( siren chirps )
- The police!

09:32.706 --> 09:33.972
( speaking Italian )

09:36.143 --> 09:37.842
( siren blaring )

09:37.844 --> 09:40.712
( speaking Italian )

09:47.654 --> 09:49.621
Aldo: Bambo, take A-4!

09:49.623 --> 09:52.123
And do not stop
for anything except fuel.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.060
Cetto:
Any possibility of food?

09:55.062 --> 09:56.795
Aldo: No!

09:59.900 --> 10:02.985
- Bambo?
- Yeah?

10:02.986 --> 10:06.071
- Where the hell are we?
- You tell me. You got the GPS.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.875
Stupid thing doesn't work
in the rain,

10:10.877 --> 10:12.644
and never in mountains.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.780
Cetto,
what does the map say?

10:15.782 --> 10:17.816
Cetto:
We have a map?

10:17.818 --> 10:20.085
- We are lost.
- ( honks horn )

10:20.087 --> 10:22.921
Lost? What do you mean lost?
You-- you don't have a plan?

10:22.923 --> 10:26.825
Of course we do.
We got a safe house to stick you in

10:26.827 --> 10:31.830
until we find out just how
much your old man loves you.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.234
Cetto: Aldo, do you think
we should be telling him that?

10:36.236 --> 10:37.369
Aldo: Shut up.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.017
Look, there's someone.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.319
Some old hag. Pull over.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.288
You stay down. Get down!

10:57.290 --> 10:59.691
Go on, ask about rooms.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.193
<i>Mi scusi, signorina.</i>

11:02.195 --> 11:04.829
We are tired and hungry.
Mostly hungry.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.065
Can you share with us
a place to sleep?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.801
Share what?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.002
A place to sleep.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.039
( speaking Italian )

11:14.041 --> 11:17.208
I share my bed with no man,
and never three.

11:17.210 --> 11:22.113
You fool! Signorina,
a room is all we ask!

11:22.115 --> 11:24.883
A place to lay our heads,
please!

11:24.885 --> 11:27.919
Bambo, let's go.
Let's go! Get out of here.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.157
Sit up, you.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.125
Look, a village.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.863
( thunder )

11:42.936 --> 11:44.969
Bambo:
Where could we stay?

11:44.971 --> 11:49.140
There. That place.

11:51.011 --> 11:55.080
It looks empty.
Do you think we could stay here?

11:55.082 --> 11:56.981
We have no choice.

11:58.452 --> 12:02.387
We have no minibar.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.823
Get our stuff from the boot
and take it up.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.992
And take that idiot, too.
Move!

12:13.900 --> 12:17.469
Excuse me? Um...

12:24.177 --> 12:27.312
( snoring )

12:43.797 --> 12:45.096
( grunts )

12:47.801 --> 12:49.501

Mr. Hutton,
may I have a word?

- Morning, Mr. Hutton.
- Yes, you may.

17:28.615 --> 17:31.382
Milan called. Apparently,
Tyler missed his morning meeting,

17:31.384 --> 17:35.086
and he never checked in to the hotel
even though his bags are there.

17:35.088 --> 17:38.589
Ah, damn kid. He must have gone
off backpacking or something.

Stop thief!

- Not for all the treasure in the Vatican!

Get out!
Get off my land!

Oh, it is you! My friend.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.456
What are you talking about?
You guys kidnapped me!

20:25.458 --> 20:26.824
Well, we didn't mean to.
Sorry.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.659
You-- you hit me.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.863
Yeah, you. One of you did it.
It really hurt.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.333
Uh, I remember.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.336
I feel so ashamed,
now you mention it.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.470
Oh.

20:40.974 --> 20:45.276
Well, good.
I guess we're cool, right?

20:45.278 --> 20:46.811
What are we doing
just standing here?

20:46.813 --> 20:49.847
Actually, I'm trying to find
the woman I love.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.716
I, too! Sort of.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.017
That makes three of us.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.952
Where's the other guy?

20:54.954 --> 20:57.555
Don't ask. Don't ask.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.327
Why we are
just standing around?

21:03.329 --> 21:06.697
We need to talk about this,
but not here.

21:06.699 --> 21:11.335
- Let's go.
- Hey.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.337
You guys wouldn't happen to have
a spare toothbrush, would you?

21:13.339 --> 21:15.573
- Some underwear or--

Aldo:
I swear upon my family's name,

21:26.352 --> 21:29.754
I never felt like this before.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.889
What could it be?

21:31.891 --> 21:36.527
All I know is, Don Rossi will
want to see his ransom soon,

21:36.529 --> 21:41.532
or see us dead,
but I cannot leave now.

21:41.534 --> 21:45.036
But if Don Rossi
cannot find us...

21:45.038 --> 21:48.973
I like it.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.808
All in favor?

22:02.322 --> 22:04.889

22:10.997 --> 22:14.065
Ahem. Here we are.

22:14.067 --> 22:17.802
Well, you again.

22:19.439 --> 22:23.708
Very well.
Sit where you can.

22:31.884 --> 22:36.387
So, what do you mean,
you are in a travel club?

22:36.389 --> 22:38.055
What is a travel club?

22:38.057 --> 22:40.791
We are like tourists, see?

22:40.793 --> 22:43.394
But we make no plans.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.129
We just, um, pop up.

22:47.767 --> 22:48.716
Yeah.

22:48.717 --> 22:49.666
And do you like
our little town?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.635
- Piano?
- We love it.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.671
It's great,
and the wine is awesome.

- What do you call this?
- <i>Fatto in casa.</i>

22:56.809 --> 22:58.976
Only the very best.

22:58.978 --> 23:02.513
Uh, would you happen
to have milk?

23:02.515 --> 23:03.948
Milk?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.850
Cow milk?

23:05.852 --> 23:08.519
- Milk for him.
- Hmm!

23:08.521 --> 23:12.556
Can somebody, anybody,
please tell me, who is that woman?

23:13.926 --> 23:16.694
Her name is Rosalia Drago.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.430
And, like her name,
she breathes fire.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.565
( laughing )

23:21.567 --> 23:24.402
I heard that, Nonna.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.605
And I hear that you men
are planning to stay.

23:27.607 --> 23:30.174
- Why?
- We're trying to find some work.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.443
Mm-hmm.

23:32.445 --> 23:35.012
So, what kind of work
you boys do?

23:35.014 --> 23:37.782
I-- I like fieldwork,

23:37.784 --> 23:39.717
anything to do with asses.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.018

23:41.020 --> 23:46.557
You know, donkeys, mules.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.426
My name is Pio.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.594
- You can work my place, yeah.
- Hmm.

23:50.596 --> 23:56.133
But do not say nothing
about my ugly niece.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.469
- No, no, no.
- ( chuckles )

23:58.471 --> 24:01.772
Me, I like hard labor.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.041
The harder, the better.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.544
My name is Robustelli,

24:06.546 --> 24:09.747
and my son Rocco
can use some help.

24:12.185 --> 24:13.918
Cows.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.954
I mean, cow. Ju-- just one.

24:16.956 --> 24:20.124
I will let you clean, sweep,
maybe paint the barn.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.828
But you stay away
from my Nuta.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.796
Do you hear?

24:25.798 --> 24:28.999
I'm not really good
at anything.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.968
I can wash dishes

24:30.970 --> 24:32.803
for you, if you want.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.006
Wait, as a travel club,

24:36.008 --> 24:39.510
you must obtain permits
to work in this village--

24:39.512 --> 24:41.946
from me, the mayor.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.815
And it will take one month.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.484
All: One month?

24:46.486 --> 24:49.653
- Maybe two.
- Oh.

24:53.226 --> 24:55.493
Oh, God.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.732
What do you want?

25:34.734 --> 25:37.701
Impossible.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.037
Work permits are like gold,

25:40.039 --> 25:43.908
and I am just
a simple village mayor.

25:43.910 --> 25:47.211
It could take months,
as I told you.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.913
Of course, of course.

25:48.915 --> 25:53.017
But there are ways
to grease a pan, no?

25:56.923 --> 25:59.056

27:00.019 --> 27:02.219

Ooh, little puss.

27:12.298 --> 27:16.834
Do you, Aldo?

27:16.836 --> 27:19.269
I, Aldo Lupo,

27:19.271 --> 27:22.272
love everything you love.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.282
See that she gets water.

28:38.284 --> 28:41.719
Hey, she trusts you.

28:41.721 --> 28:44.455
That's good, Cetto.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.057
Tomorrow, you'll milk her.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.362
Me?

28:59.371 --> 29:01.138
Mr. Hutton,
you're in awfully early.

29:01.140 --> 29:04.108
I never left.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.477
I got a call last night
as I was leaving.

29:07.813 --> 29:08.979
Tyler's been kidnapped.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.515
Kidnapped? Are you serious?

29:11.517 --> 29:14.518
I need to send money.
They say they're gonna kill him.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.355
I can't believe this.
The sheer stupidity.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.791
Look out!

29:20.793 --> 29:25.295
( cheering, chattering )

29:52.892 --> 29:54.324
Look out below!

30:02.401 --> 30:04.401
Whoo!

30:10.476 --> 30:12.476
Well, good night, then.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.848
<i>Ciao.</i>

30:17.849 --> 30:19.849
<i>Ciao,</i> Tyler.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.486
Wait, Tyler?

30:22.488 --> 30:24.254
I wanted to say something.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.090
Um, I want to say thank you.

30:27.092 --> 30:30.294
Thank you?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.296
- Can I say something?
- Of course.

30:32.298 --> 30:35.199
I have been in love with you

30:35.201 --> 30:37.901
since the instant
that I saw you.

30:39.872 --> 30:42.306
I know that we're
working together, and, uh,

30:42.308 --> 30:44.208
I know nobody knows
what the future really holds,

30:44.210 --> 30:46.577
- but I do know--
- Give me your hand.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.550
Yeah.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.989
( chuckles )
Time for you to go home.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.958
Okay. Okay, okay.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.460
Tyler: Can I ask
you guys something?

31:03.462 --> 31:04.895
What?

31:04.897 --> 31:06.864
How much am I worth?

31:06.866 --> 31:09.299
- What do you mean?
- Ransom-wise.

31:09.301 --> 31:13.237
Like, how much does this
Don guy want? A million?

31:13.239 --> 31:15.105
Half a million euros.

31:15.107 --> 31:17.507
Don Rossi, you know,
is a very reasonable man.

31:17.509 --> 31:20.878
Shut up, cow-boy!
You know nothing.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.615
Besides, we all want
to stay here, right?

31:24.617 --> 31:27.651
So why are we even
talking of ransom?

31:27.653 --> 31:29.219
You're right.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.390
It doesn't matter.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.427
Nonna, what do you make
of that odd American?

31:37.429 --> 31:39.496
The one called Tyler?

31:39.498 --> 31:40.898
Oh.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.904
The poor stupid boy.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.640
He's under a spell.

31:49.642 --> 31:54.444
I'm sure of it.
I can feel it when he passes.

31:54.446 --> 31:59.316
So? I mean, some say that love
can be like that, no?

31:59.318 --> 32:01.351
Stupid?

32:02.688 --> 32:08.158
Rose, a spell
is nothing to fool with.

32:10.663 --> 32:13.697
<i>How would you ever know
if his love is true?</i>

32:16.135 --> 32:20.704
More than anything,
you must protect your heart.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.213
Okay, so, um,
we got off on the wrong foot.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.153
Where is he going?

32:36.155 --> 32:38.055
The cantina, I guess.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.190
He's upset about Rosalia.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.192
We had better watch him.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.227
He might try to do
something stupid.

32:44.229 --> 32:46.596
It could ruin everything.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.665
- ( knocking )
- Tyler: Hello?

32:49.668 --> 32:51.201
Hello?

32:51.203 --> 32:53.503
Oh! Oh, my gosh.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.505
Sorry.
It's a little dark in here.

32:55.507 --> 32:59.509
- I didn't see you.
- I'm saving my light bulbs.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.578
Oh, yeah.
That's a good idea.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.646
You're looking for
my Rosalia?

33:03.649 --> 33:06.350
She has no time for you.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.352
Did she say that?

33:08.354 --> 33:11.054
She's gone for firewood.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.523
Each day she must find wood.

33:13.525 --> 33:18.061
<i>I tell her to leave
this sad place, but no.</i>

33:18.063 --> 33:20.263
She does everything for me.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.702
We have little money,
yet she stays here in Piano for me.

33:25.704 --> 33:29.406
Look, she's my Rosali.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.379
- Hmm.
- I wish there was something I could do to help you.

33:35.381 --> 33:39.282
- And I for you.
- ( horn honking )

33:39.284 --> 33:42.619
Excuse me. The mayor.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.658
( horn honking )

33:48.660 --> 33:51.328
<i>Signora</i> Corvo!

33:51.330 --> 33:53.530
- Your list.
- Yes.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.401
Hmm. Medicine?

33:57.403 --> 33:59.736
- That is all?
- It is all we can afford.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.508
<i>Signora,</i>
I do not have all day.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.277
Ah, these hands.
You see why I need my medicine?

34:07.279 --> 34:10.414
- Very well. I'm off.
- ( sighs )

34:10.416 --> 34:13.417
Hey, wait. Wait!
Where are you going?

34:13.418 --> 34:14.583
To the city, the big city.

34:14.585 --> 34:16.453
What can I get for you?

34:16.454 --> 34:18.321
Uh, actually, could--
could I come, too?

34:18.322 --> 34:21.558
I'd like to pick up some,
uh, supplies and things.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.194
How-- how big is this--
um, this city?

34:24.196 --> 34:27.731
Big! The selections
are unlimited.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.699
<i>( music playing )</i>

34:29.701 --> 34:33.469
- Let's go!

35:26.325 --> 35:28.391
- Well, this is it.
- ( cow mooing )

35:30.762 --> 35:32.362
My big date.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.302

35:41.373 --> 35:44.608
- ( clanging )
- ( cow moos painfully )

35:44.610 --> 35:46.643
Cetto: Sorry!

35:52.751 --> 35:55.185
Rocco, do you believe
in spells?

35:59.658 --> 36:03.193
My friends and I, you know,

36:03.195 --> 36:05.929
we think perhaps
we are under one.

36:09.601 --> 36:12.202
Could it be?

36:12.204 --> 36:14.671
And if it could,

36:14.673 --> 36:18.241
could it be that, well...

36:18.243 --> 36:21.811
without this spell,
without <i> sarbolai,</i>

36:21.813 --> 36:26.683
you and me
would not be partners?

36:28.554 --> 36:31.721
Oh.

36:31.723 --> 36:35.425
Well, that's for you
to decide, Bambo.

36:37.930 --> 36:41.364
Each man must know
his own heart.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.283
( vibrating )

37:00.285 --> 37:00.817
Oh.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.557
( muttering )

37:11.663 --> 37:14.664
Aldo! Ah, there you are.

37:14.666 --> 37:18.902
- Yes.
- You sound funny. You catch a cold?

37:18.904 --> 37:20.670
<i>Si.</i>

37:20.672 --> 37:23.974
But, uh, no problems, right?

37:23.976 --> 37:25.842
- Pronto.
- <i>Perfetto.</i>

37:25.844 --> 37:28.445
I'll let you know when
he's ready to make the drop.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.915
<i>Si.</i>

37:31.917 --> 37:33.984
Okay, sit tight then.<i> Ciao.</i>

37:35.887 --> 37:37.454
<i>Ciao.</i>

37:37.456 --> 37:39.623
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- Funny.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.859
Usually, I cannot get that
moron Aldo to shut his mouth.

37:42.861 --> 37:46.496
<i>Something's wrong here.</i>

37:46.498 --> 37:48.798
Get the coordinates
of that phone call.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.635
<i>I want my money.</i>

37:58.810 --> 38:00.944
Hi there.
Sorry I'm late.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.314
I went into the city and,

38:04.316 --> 38:05.482
well, that's why
I wasn't here.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.350
I got some presents.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.319
I got this excellent
scrubbing pad.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.721
I use it at home--
when I'm at home.

38:11.723 --> 38:15.025
Um, I got, well,
this is a little something

38:15.027 --> 38:17.527
that I got for your nonna.

38:17.529 --> 38:22.065
Kinda lame, but who
doesn't need light bulbs?

38:22.067 --> 38:24.334
I thought they were...

38:28.807 --> 38:29.973
Are you mad at me?

38:38.083 --> 38:40.984
Well, that kinda
sums it all up.

38:40.986 --> 38:45.689
I'm just gonna take my things

38:45.691 --> 38:48.858
and, um, I'm gonna go then.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.994
So, good night.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.831
<i>Ciao.</i>

38:55.967 --> 38:58.501
I'll, um...

38:59.905 --> 39:02.505
( door opens, closes )

39:06.445 --> 39:08.712
What rhymes
with "romantic"?

39:08.714 --> 39:10.714
You are writing another poem?

39:10.716 --> 39:13.550
Yeah, for Rocco.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.852
"Gigantic"?

39:15.854 --> 39:17.620
Yeah.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.889
Yeah, I can make that work.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.562
Bambo, olive oil.

39:25.564 --> 39:29.032
- <i>Perfetto.</i>
- Where were you?

39:29.034 --> 39:32.569
Just some, uh,
travel club shopping.

39:32.571 --> 39:34.804
Here, catch.

39:34.806 --> 39:38.842
Huh. Cologne!

39:38.844 --> 39:42.045
And some hand cream
for Cetto.

39:44.783 --> 39:46.850
What's with him?

39:48.920 --> 39:52.055
Cetto, hand cream.
Just gonna leave it right there.

39:53.125 --> 39:56.126
Hey, you know what?

39:56.128 --> 39:59.763
Maybe I, Aldo Lupo,
was wrong about you.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.998
I suspected you might leave.

40:03.902 --> 40:07.904
Rosalia's not going anywhere.
Why would I?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.773
( chuckles )

40:09.775 --> 40:12.842
( muttering )
That's good.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.585
Shh.

<i>Banyo,</i> that's what I said.

41:49.384 --> 41:51.073
No,<i> banyo,</i> it's, uh, toilet.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.943
Yeah, I know. I thought
we were singing about a toilet.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.512
<i>♪ Banyo ♪</i>

41:55.514 --> 41:56.813
No.

41:58.049 --> 42:00.783
( horn honking )

42:00.785 --> 42:03.052
I just heard the big news!

42:03.054 --> 42:05.021
Your package has come!

42:05.023 --> 42:07.891
I am going now to see it!

42:07.893 --> 42:09.926
- Tell Tyler!
- ( horn honking )

42:09.928 --> 42:12.061
Wait, Mr. Mayor, wait!
Wait for me!

42:12.063 --> 42:13.630
Wait for me! Hold on!

42:15.901 --> 42:17.534
What package is this?

42:17.536 --> 42:20.136
- Huh?
- Oh.

42:20.138 --> 42:23.706
That guy.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.575
I can never really understand
what he's talking about.

42:25.577 --> 42:29.646
<i>( music playing )</i>

42:34.653 --> 42:36.052

with my boys?

42:52.003 --> 42:55.238
( speaking Italian )

42:55.240 --> 42:58.241
Okay, okay. Talk to me then.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.578
- <i>Who do you work for?</i>
- Rosalia.

43:01.580 --> 43:04.981
- A woman?
- <i>Si.</i>

43:04.983 --> 43:09.252
Well, you can tell her that I
will mount an army against her.

43:09.254 --> 43:12.855
- <i>Si.</i>
- We have your coordinates,

43:12.857 --> 43:15.358
<i>and it's only a matter of time
before I find you.</i>

43:15.360 --> 43:18.761
And when I do,
I will hurt you both!

43:18.763 --> 43:21.064
<i>You and Rosalia! Capisci?</i>

43:21.066 --> 43:24.200
- <i>I do not play games!</i>

43:44.823 --> 43:47.023
So, even though
cultivation of lavender

43:47.025 --> 43:49.392
would be new here
in the valley,

43:49.394 --> 43:51.327
it's being done elsewhere,

43:51.329 --> 43:53.296
and there is
money to be had.

43:56.401 --> 43:59.235
Everybody likes flowers, Papa.

44:02.741 --> 44:03.806
Hmm.

44:03.808 --> 44:07.010
Ah.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.278
- A partnership?
- ( chuckles )

44:12.851 --> 44:15.985
So this is why you two
are so inseparable.

44:15.987 --> 44:19.088
( both chuckle )

44:19.090 --> 44:24.694
My brother and I once,
we were like this.

44:24.696 --> 44:27.830
Living together,
farming together,

44:27.832 --> 44:31.000
until...

44:31.002 --> 44:34.771
until he tried to steal
my lady friend.

44:34.773 --> 44:38.875
That betrayer. That devil!

44:38.877 --> 44:42.078
God help me,
because I still dream

44:42.080 --> 44:45.882
of choking the life
out of that snake

44:45.884 --> 44:48.117
with these bare hands!

44:48.119 --> 44:53.056
<i>Papa! Papa!</i>

44:53.058 --> 44:56.192
It's okay, it's okay.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.367
And there will be
no lady friends

45:04.369 --> 45:07.070
to come between us.

45:07.072 --> 45:08.304
That I promise.

45:16.247 --> 45:18.848
( phone ringing )

45:23.388 --> 45:26.756
- Hello?
- Mr. Hutton,

45:26.758 --> 45:29.325
sorry to disturb you
at such an early hour,

45:29.327 --> 45:33.196
but I believe you have been
waiting for this call.

45:33.198 --> 45:35.131
Yes, I have.
It's about time.

45:35.133 --> 45:37.467
Where's my son?

45:37.468 --> 45:39.802
<i>With my men,
and perfectly safe.</i>

45:39.803 --> 45:42.137
- Let us talk about this money.
- <i>What's there to talk about?</i>

45:42.140 --> 45:44.006
I sent it just like
I was supposed to.

45:44.008 --> 45:46.909
What do you mean,
you sent it?

45:46.911 --> 45:49.479
My son's email had
very detailed instructions,

45:49.481 --> 45:51.831
and I followed them
to the letter.

45:51.832 --> 45:54.182
What email?
Where did you send it?

45:54.185 --> 45:57.153
- I don't know.
- Because I do not have it.

45:57.155 --> 45:59.388
Some place in Italy.
It's on my computer.

45:59.390 --> 46:04.193
Either you're lying
or we have both been duped.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.135
Hey, there.

46:12.137 --> 46:14.403
We are closed now.
It's Monday.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.839
I'm not really here
to do dishes.

46:16.841 --> 46:18.775
Why are you here then?

46:22.113 --> 46:23.446
Did you get my package?

46:24.816 --> 46:27.517
Money.
You brought me money?

46:27.519 --> 46:31.954
Rosalia: Your father,
he sounds so very successful.

46:31.956 --> 46:34.457
Tyler: Yeah, whatever, he is.
He's got a lot of money.

46:34.459 --> 46:37.560
You-- I don't know,

46:37.562 --> 46:40.997
you deserve
the life of a queen.

46:40.999 --> 46:43.332
Something is wrong
with my life?

46:43.334 --> 46:45.468
Well, no. No, no.

46:45.470 --> 46:50.006
No. No, It's not that.
It's just--

46:50.008 --> 46:52.341
Yes. Yeah, something is
wrong with your life.

46:52.343 --> 46:54.076
It's too difficult here.

46:54.078 --> 46:56.279
Your nonna, she can barely
afford medicine.

46:56.281 --> 46:58.481
I mean, look,
this place is beautiful.

46:58.483 --> 47:02.451
It's magical, but, come on.
Is that gonna be enough?

47:02.453 --> 47:05.388
You've really, really,
really got to think about your future.

47:05.390 --> 47:08.024
Think about all
the cool places you could go,

47:08.026 --> 47:10.026
all the things
you could see and do

47:10.028 --> 47:13.830
with-- with me.

47:13.832 --> 47:18.267
- How much?
- How much what?

47:18.269 --> 47:20.036
Money. If you're
asking to buy me,

47:20.038 --> 47:21.821
I want to know what I'm worth.

47:21.822 --> 47:23.605
No, you're taking this
the wrong way.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.909
I don't mean it like that.

47:25.910 --> 47:28.211
No, Tyler,
it is very clear.

47:28.213 --> 47:29.979
You're attracted to me, yes,

47:29.981 --> 47:32.015
and probably under a spell,

47:32.016 --> 47:34.050
but that doesn't mean
you can chain me to your money.

47:34.052 --> 47:35.218
That's not true!

47:35.220 --> 47:36.619
I'll tell you the truth.

47:36.621 --> 47:41.057
You, Tyler, cannot afford me.

47:41.059 --> 47:43.326
I have never yet
met a man who could.

47:46.097 --> 47:47.430
The church has your money.

48:14.559 --> 48:17.560
So, you were abducted?

48:17.562 --> 48:19.562
Kidnapped.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.430
And they brought you here?

48:21.432 --> 48:23.966
- By mistake.
- I understand.

48:23.968 --> 48:28.537
But if you're not being held,
why not leave?

48:28.539 --> 48:30.573
I would.

48:31.576 --> 48:34.410
I should, but...

48:36.114 --> 48:39.949
- I can't.
- No.

48:39.951 --> 48:41.584
It is because
you are condemned.

48:41.586 --> 48:44.587
- What? I'm--
- Condemned to love, Tyler.

48:49.594 --> 48:50.944
You're under a spell.

48:50.945 --> 48:52.295
- A spell?
- Believe as you like,

48:52.297 --> 48:54.597
it makes no difference.

48:54.599 --> 48:57.533
- Um...
- The spell has you.

48:57.535 --> 49:01.337
- Come on, Father. I--
- The spell has you.

49:01.339 --> 49:03.472
( thunder )

49:03.474 --> 49:06.976
Okay. Um, wow.

49:06.978 --> 49:08.978
Okay, well, why don't
we say that you're right

49:08.980 --> 49:10.680
and that I'm under a spell.

49:10.682 --> 49:13.015
Um, can you, um--

49:13.017 --> 49:17.153
can you do one of
your exorcisms or something?

49:17.155 --> 49:21.357
My son, an exorcism
can only cast out evil.

49:21.359 --> 49:23.626
( thunder )

49:23.628 --> 49:26.629
As for your money,

49:26.631 --> 49:29.632
Rosalia does not want it.

49:29.634 --> 49:31.133
She does not need it.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.477
She asked me to give it
to the poor.

49:41.479 --> 49:45.114
They are the poor.
Everybody here is poor.

49:45.116 --> 49:48.150
Take it.
Do what you must.

49:49.187 --> 49:51.087
But do not fool your heart.

49:54.192 --> 49:55.992
Love cannot be bought.

49:55.994 --> 49:59.261
Money cannot break a spell.

50:03.134 --> 50:05.167
Rosalia!

50:06.671 --> 50:10.239
Rosalia, come on!
I'm sorry, all right?

50:10.241 --> 50:12.725
I'm sorry about the money.

50:12.726 --> 50:15.210
I'm not trying got buy you!
I'm just-- it's a symbol.

50:15.213 --> 50:17.380
Look, look, look.
The money doesn't even matter.

50:17.382 --> 50:21.050
I just want to show you how much
I care about you, that's all!

50:21.052 --> 50:23.486
This is all just a stupid
misunderstanding. That's it!

50:23.488 --> 50:27.223
If you come downstairs, we--

50:27.225 --> 50:29.392
we can talk about it.

50:43.241 --> 50:46.742
( Cetto whimpering )

50:48.713 --> 50:51.714
( whimpering )

50:52.717 --> 50:54.550
Nuta.

51:03.428 --> 51:05.061
For God's sakes.

51:06.431 --> 51:09.732
It's just a cow.
It's just a cow.

51:13.604 --> 51:15.404
Cetto: Nuta.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.741
Nuta.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.745
Oh, Nuta.

51:27.118 --> 51:28.250
No.

51:30.288 --> 51:31.754
No, it's more than that.

51:33.357 --> 51:37.726
( bell tolling )

51:49.474 --> 51:50.639
What's going on?

51:56.314 --> 51:59.148
Behold your Mayor!

51:59.150 --> 52:01.283
Behold this cow!

52:02.854 --> 52:05.788
Behold the beginnings
of a new day

52:05.790 --> 52:10.126
in the greatest village
on Earth!

52:10.128 --> 52:11.627
Piano!

52:11.629 --> 52:14.163
You are drunk, you old fool.

52:14.165 --> 52:17.333
- What's the purpose?
- The purpose, my friends,

52:17.335 --> 52:20.202
will soon be
abundantly clear!

52:20.204 --> 52:24.673
Cetto, come here!
Ah, Cetto!

52:26.677 --> 52:29.812
As you know, citizens,

52:29.814 --> 52:34.817
Piano has suffered
its share of disappointment.

52:34.819 --> 52:38.354
- Get to the point.
- Eh, the point.

52:38.356 --> 52:42.525
The point is... I am rich!

52:42.527 --> 52:45.294
( cheering )

52:45.296 --> 52:49.165
And when I am rich,
Piano is rich!

52:49.167 --> 52:54.603
And when Piano is rich,
she celebrates!

52:54.605 --> 52:59.842
Let us celebrate
the greatest festival

52:59.844 --> 53:03.579
the world shall ever know!

53:03.581 --> 53:08.250
The festival of Sarbolai!

53:08.252 --> 53:11.320
Sarbolai!

53:11.322 --> 53:13.856
- Sarbolai!
- ( cheering )

53:13.858 --> 53:15.824
Sarbolai!

53:15.826 --> 53:17.860
( laughing, cheering )

53:17.862 --> 53:20.362
Sarbolai!

53:35.947 --> 53:37.980
And now for you, sir.

53:50.795 --> 53:53.429
<i>Adieu,</i> Nuta.

54:19.924 --> 54:23.592
My Fedelia, I would like
to tell you something,

54:23.594 --> 54:26.428
something that has been
bothering me.

54:28.299 --> 54:30.633
- I am not in a travel club.
- No?

54:30.635 --> 54:33.969
No, I am in another club.

54:33.971 --> 54:36.939
It's name is <i> famiglia</i> Rossi.

54:39.810 --> 54:42.645
You are <i> mafioso.</i>

54:42.647 --> 54:46.815
I was, until I met you.

54:46.817 --> 54:49.818
So, you do bad things.

54:49.820 --> 54:52.955
Like I say, not now.

54:52.957 --> 54:55.824
Not since I met you.

54:55.826 --> 54:59.962
- You changed me.
- Aldo, dear,

54:59.964 --> 55:03.632
you know I cannot love a man
who does bad things.

55:04.835 --> 55:08.337
Oh, please.

55:08.339 --> 55:10.306
I'm sorry.

55:11.842 --> 55:15.678
Do not mention this
to Uncle Pio.

55:15.680 --> 55:18.480
I will pray about it.

55:20.584 --> 55:25.487
<i>( music playing )</i>

55:26.691 --> 55:28.624
( horn honking )

55:28.626 --> 55:31.493
<i>( music continues )</i>

55:45.976 --> 55:48.677
Thank you!
Thank you, my friends!

55:53.084 --> 55:54.950
( indistinct chatter )

56:15.539 --> 56:18.907
( no audible dialogue )

56:23.447 --> 56:26.482
( all clamoring,
cheering )

56:29.887 --> 56:32.388
( cheering )

56:33.891 --> 56:35.457
That's my boy!

56:35.459 --> 56:37.760
( laughing )

56:39.930 --> 56:42.431
( speaking Italian )

56:42.433 --> 56:43.432
Have you seen Rosalia?

56:43.434 --> 56:44.700
We saw her leave.

56:44.702 --> 56:46.468
Where did she go?

56:46.470 --> 56:48.170
All we know
is what she said.

56:48.172 --> 56:49.805
Which was?

56:49.807 --> 56:52.141
All: "We know nothing
about festivals."

56:53.811 --> 56:55.661
She took her big wagon.

56:55.662 --> 56:57.512
She did not say
where to or why.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.949
Thank you.

57:00.951 --> 57:04.953
( band playing )

57:04.955 --> 57:08.090
( bells ringing )

57:24.642 --> 57:26.074
Whoa! Ho!

57:31.482 --> 57:32.848
Can I talk to you?

57:37.655 --> 57:38.887
Can I please talk to you?

57:40.658 --> 57:42.791
Rosalia, can I talk to you?

57:43.994 --> 57:46.128
Hey. Hello.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.497
As you can see, I am busy.

57:48.499 --> 57:51.133
My horses are thirsty.

57:51.135 --> 57:53.669
Um, can I pretty please
talk to you?

57:53.671 --> 57:56.839
Talk! Why talk?

57:56.841 --> 58:01.076
I know what you did.
I understand everything.

58:01.078 --> 58:04.680
You tried to buy me
like a cow.

58:04.682 --> 58:07.516
- A cow!
- Yes, yes.

58:07.518 --> 58:08.951
But that was only
for a minute,

58:08.953 --> 58:10.552
and I realize
that was wrong, and I--

58:10.554 --> 58:14.089
You know nothing
about women, do you?

58:14.091 --> 58:18.026
Or about love, do you?

58:18.028 --> 58:20.529
Obviously not.

58:20.531 --> 58:21.763
You did a nice thing
for Cetto

58:21.765 --> 58:23.699
and the people of Piano,

58:23.701 --> 58:26.535
and I would forgive you
if I could,

58:26.537 --> 58:28.804
but I cannot.

58:28.806 --> 58:32.040
Besides, you're crazy,
and you're under a spell.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.842
Go away, Tyler.

58:37.715 --> 58:39.681
Go away, Tyler.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.684
I'm not crazy!

58:48.058 --> 58:50.826
And I'm not under a spell!

59:29.800 --> 59:33.035
Signora Corvo:
Those mountains up there,

59:33.037 --> 59:38.707
once, they were covered
with cedar trees.

59:40.110 --> 59:43.078
In my time,
we called them <i> sarbolai.</i>

59:44.782 --> 59:49.251
We loved them,
but not enough.

59:49.253 --> 59:51.787
We cut them down.

59:51.789 --> 59:53.255
The very last tree

59:53.257 --> 59:56.625
was used to repair
your cottage,

59:56.627 --> 01:00:00.796
and it was then
that our misfortunes began.

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:03.732
In this life,
we make many mistakes.

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:06.101
That's for sure.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:09.771
Definitely made
a few of those.

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:15.110
But I don't think
me being here was a mistake.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.698
You know, part of me
wants to stay here forever,

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:22.116
and the other half just wants to
leave, never come back.

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.290
There is but one answer.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:32.995
You must break the spell
and find a way

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:36.999
to win the love
of she who drives you mad.

01:00:37.001 --> 01:00:41.036
Wait for a sign,
foolish boy.

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:45.073
A single kiss will tell you
all you need to know.

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:50.312
How much farther is this?

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.848
How long you figure,
Salvatore?

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.651
Uh, we are very close.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:01:00.288
( band playing )

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.039
( applause )

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.207
Aldo!

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:20.842
- Come here.
- Me?

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:23.345
- Aldo!
- You, you, you!

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:26.415
( clamoring )

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:28.850
( applause )

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:31.286
Aldo!

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:35.157
( feigns crying )

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:44.299
( growls, laughs )

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.068
( applause )

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.804
( band playing )

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.741
Come on!

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:54.776
Fedelia, come on!

01:01:56.413 --> 01:01:58.213
Jump in!

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:26.875
Yeah!

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.317
( distant cheers )

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:38.954
And now, Bambo! Ha, ha!

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.122
( band playing )

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.389
Hey, Bambo!

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:09.317
Bambo!

01:03:41.185 --> 01:03:43.552
( cheering )

01:03:43.554 --> 01:03:45.987
- He's my son!
- Thank you.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:54.496
Crowd:
Rosalia, Rosalia, Rosalia!

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:58.200
Rosalia, Rosalia, Rosalia!

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:01.837
Rosalia, Rosalia, Rosalia!

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:04.172
( chanting continues )

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.476
( thunder )

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:11.213
( chanting continues )

01:04:17.588 --> 01:04:19.454
( chanting )

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:22.224
Rosalia! Rosalia!

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.526
( chanting continues )

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.415
( thunder )

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.618
( band playing )

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:54.256
( chanting )

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:58.260
( cheers and clapping )

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:03.164
Let's go, boys!

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.685
See ya... later!

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:37.465
See ya!

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.039
( shouting )

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:00.188
All my dreams come true.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.158
Man: Come on, Rosalia!
Pick someone!

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.960
Man 2:
Me, me, me.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:08.663
Send me a love that is true.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.340
An ass?

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:21.609
This is what the gods send me
when I make a wish?

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.545
( Rosalia laughs )

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:25.213
They are so cruel with love.

01:06:25.215 --> 01:06:28.049
- Tyler: Make way.
- ( band playing )

01:06:28.051 --> 01:06:30.218
- Make way for the ass.
- Come on!

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:36.024
- Tyler: Hello.
- Rosalia: You again!

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.026
Tyler: Oh,
were you expecting someone else?

01:06:42.366 --> 01:06:45.266
Rosalia: I thought
I told you to go away!

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.603
Then why are you here?

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:55.243
Tyler:
You hit like a girl.

01:06:55.245 --> 01:06:57.379
Rosalia: What's the matter?
Can't you keep up?

01:06:57.381 --> 01:06:59.147
It's like I'm under a spell.

Tyler:
How about a kiss?

01:07:11.395 --> 01:07:13.528
Rosalia:
In your dreams.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.398

- Rosalia: You are insane!

You're not bad for a goat.

You.

You broke the spell.

All right, all right,
all right.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.509
Someone explain to me
this madness.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:08.810
Father, it's me, Tyler.

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:10.511
Remember?
The condemned one?

01:09:10.514 --> 01:09:11.845
I brought a few friends,

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:13.915
and we came here to
be married.

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:14.916
Are you drunk?

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.584
All: Yes!

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:19.287
- Rosalia?
- Yes,<i> Padre?</i>

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:22.590
- Did you break the spell?
- Yes,<i> Padre.</i>

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:26.528
- Very well.
- So do we,<i> Padre,</i>

01:09:26.529 --> 01:09:28.696
want to get married.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:32.200
<i>Padre,</i> my partner and I,

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:33.734
we deserve nothing less.

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:37.337
Wait. What about us?

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.840
Are you all mad?

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:42.710
<i>Padre.</i>
It comes from above.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.345
A wedding here tonight?

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:47.348
You mean for who?
My boy here?

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.350
All: Yes!

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:52.386
( sighs )

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.689
Why not? He's my son!

01:09:58.261 --> 01:10:00.528
- Woman: Bravo!
- And that's my son.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:08.970
And I am here for one reason.

01:10:08.972 --> 01:10:11.339
Actually, two.

01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:14.309
Money and revenge.

01:10:16.246 --> 01:10:17.996
And I came for my son.

01:10:17.997 --> 01:10:19.747
So whatever it is
you're doing,

01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:22.750
you can stop it now.

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.752
Tyler, what are you doing?

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:27.322
I'm, uh, getting married.

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:30.225
Uh, Dad, this is Rosalia.

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:33.561
I have not time for this.
Where is my money?

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.897
Okay, I hate to break it
to you, mafia man,

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:37.432
but your money's gone.

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:39.951
Seriously?

01:10:39.952 --> 01:10:41.602
Tyler, have you
lost your mind?

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:45.440
Mm-hmm. Yup.
Completely lost my mind.

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:48.360
It totally ran away.
But now it's back,

01:10:48.361 --> 01:10:51.279
and it helped me find
something else that I'd lost.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:54.549
- I found my heart.
- ( crowd murmurs )

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:57.785
So I send you on a simple
buying trip, Tyler,

01:10:57.787 --> 01:10:59.587
and this is what
you come up with?

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.388
Dad, I'm sorry
if I let you down,

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:04.325
but to tell you
the truth, really?

01:11:04.327 --> 01:11:07.629
Purses, and totes, and shoes,
and all that stuff,

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:08.963
it doesn't matter to me,
all right?

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:11.733
And boots!
Ugh! I hate boots.

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:14.269
All that stuff,
it doesn't matter to me.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:16.571
It never has.
That's your world, Pop.

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:19.374
I don't care about
any of it.

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:23.645
What do you care about then?

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:24.879
You know,
you asked me that before

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:26.481
and I didn't have an answer,

01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:28.283
but now I do.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.288
Her.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:36.324
I care about her.

01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:37.825
And you, too, Dad.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.827
Despite everything,
I care about you.

01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:47.335
Son, please,

01:11:47.337 --> 01:11:48.536
just come home.

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:51.472
We have business to run.

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:54.642
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:12:01.582
I know, I'd have everything
a guy could ever ask for.

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:04.519
But then I'd just be under
another crazy spell,

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:06.054
and I'm done with those.

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.993
I pick her.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.500
You will give it
all up for me?

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.636
In a heartbeat.

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:27.041
Then I will marry you,
Tyler Hutton.

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:29.410
Wait a second.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.947
You're both insane.

01:12:33.817 --> 01:12:35.784
Nobody move.

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:37.752
I'm taking my men
and leaving.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.725
Aldo, Bambo, Cetto.

01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:47.362
<i>Andiamo.</i>

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:49.397

- No.

We are getting married!

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.134
We are nice people now.

- What?
- <i>Si.</i>

01:12:56.973 --> 01:13:00.675

Who will give
these brides away?

01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:15.456
You must stop this.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:21.062
So, let the weddings begin!

The happy couple!
