WEBVTT

00:06.709 --> 00:07.667
Morning, Mom.

00:08.166 --> 00:10.083
- Eh.
- Tough night?

00:10.250 --> 00:14.375
I had to get up three times with the baby
and your Father was absolutely no help.

00:14.458 --> 00:15.709
Sure I was.

00:15.792 --> 00:19.583
Flicking me in the forehead
and saying "baby's crying" is not helpful.

00:20.625 --> 00:23.166
Honey, if I flicked you in the forehead
and didn't say anything,

00:23.250 --> 00:24.250
that'd just be mean.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.000
Hey, after breakfast,
can somebody watch Toby

00:28.083 --> 00:29.250
while I grab a quick shower?

00:29.333 --> 00:30.709
Oh, I can't.

00:30.792 --> 00:33.333
I have a maggot-infested rats' nest
that needs my attention.

00:33.417 --> 00:34.959
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:35.041 --> 00:37.417
Sorry, Mom. I'd love to,
but I'm going to the mall with Ivy.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.208
We're gonna shop and look for jobs.

00:39.583 --> 00:40.583
Mostly shop.

00:42.291 --> 00:43.166
See you.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.000
And I'm taking Charlie to the park.

00:46.083 --> 00:47.625
Oh, maybe you can take Toby with you.

00:47.709 --> 00:49.667
- No thank you, Mama.
- Hmm.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.959
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.208
Gabe?

00:54.250 --> 00:55.625
No thank you, Mama.

Okay, Charlie. Here we go. Have fun.

01:57.333 --> 01:58.333
Not too fast.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.208
Not too fast.

02:00.291 --> 02:01.917
She's already the fastest kid in the park.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.583
If you wanna see fast,

02:03.667 --> 02:05.583
you should see my nephew Mason
ride his trike.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.375
- You know what his friends call him?
- What?

02:07.458 --> 02:10.375
Nothing. He's so fast,
he doesn't have time to make friends.

02:11.041 --> 02:14.959
Yeah, well, Charlie's so fast,
that... that she makes friends,

02:15.041 --> 02:16.709
but then she goes so far,

02:16.792 --> 02:19.417
by the time she comes back
they've changed and moved on...

02:19.500 --> 02:21.542
And... I am really not good at this.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.500
The point is, Mason's faster.

02:25.583 --> 02:27.583
No. Charlie's faster.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.250
You know what this reminds me of?

02:29.458 --> 02:31.625
The conversation that we had
before the baby race.

02:31.709 --> 02:34.417
Oh. The baby race.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.208
Come on, Charlie, you can do it.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.709
Coming down the home stretch,
it's still Mason in the lead!

02:40.792 --> 02:43.500
Come on, Charlie. It's now or never!

02:50.083 --> 02:53.375
And the winner is Charlie!

03:02.250 --> 03:03.166
Okay.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.792
Charlie may be faster on her feet,
but on wheels?

03:07.041 --> 03:08.291
Mason's the man.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.875
Guess there's only one way to find out.

03:10.959 --> 03:12.959
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

03:13.041 --> 03:14.333
Baby race two.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.417
The empire trikes back!

03:23.375 --> 03:24.333
Hey, Dad.

03:24.417 --> 03:25.417
Teddy: Hi, Mr. Wentz.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.834
We're going to the mall
to shop and look for jobs.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.166
But mostly shop.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.458
- Wallet's over there.
- How much can I take?

03:32.542 --> 03:33.375
Doesn't matter.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.000
Nothing matters.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.250
Ivy, why is your Dad so depressed?

03:38.375 --> 03:39.417
I don't know.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.041
I think it might be
something about his job.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.583
- What does he do?
- I don't know.

03:43.792 --> 03:46.959
Ivy, you're not going to the mall
without cleaning your room, are you?

03:49.625 --> 03:52.458
Oh, Harry, honey.
I don't know why you're so down.

03:52.542 --> 03:55.083
Show Teddy the award you got last night.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.625
That's The Silver Plungie.

04:00.709 --> 04:05.041
It's in recognition of Harry's 25 years
in the plumbing supply business.

04:05.333 --> 04:08.875
Oh, congratulations, Mr. Wentz.
That is quite an honor.

04:08.959 --> 04:12.875
Well, I think so.
It even has an inscription. See?

04:13.250 --> 04:17.500
It says, "to Harry Wentz,
for 25 years of duty".

04:19.125 --> 04:20.250
Well, that's unfortunate.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.750
Oh, I'm gonna go find a place for it.

04:26.458 --> 04:28.500
Is this all I have to show..

04:29.250 --> 04:31.250
For 25 years of my life?

04:32.041 --> 04:34.792
A plunger that they spray-painted silver.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.583
It's glittery, too.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.000
I used to have dreams.

04:41.291 --> 04:42.583
Big dreams.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.750
I wanted to be a weatherman.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.208
I wanted to open a restaurant.

04:49.125 --> 04:52.291
But I'm too old for any of that now.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.375
Mr. Wentz, you are never too old
to pursue your dreams.

04:56.417 --> 04:58.000
Oh, Teddy, I don't know.

04:58.333 --> 05:00.500
Have you seen that commercial
for the new fitness centers?

05:00.583 --> 05:02.000
The one with the talking gophers?

05:02.083 --> 05:04.375
Right. The skinny gopher
says to the fat gopher,

05:04.458 --> 05:05.583
"If you wanna lose that weight,

05:05.667 --> 05:07.792
you gotta get off your butt
and 'gopher' it".

05:08.667 --> 05:10.166
Well, sure, it's a terrific commercial.

05:10.458 --> 05:11.417
But what's your point?

05:12.917 --> 05:14.750
That's what you gotta do, Mr. Wentz.

05:14.834 --> 05:17.709
You gotta follow your
dreams and "gopher" it!

05:18.208 --> 05:19.417
"Gopher" it.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.625
"Gopher" it.

05:30.583 --> 05:32.333
Why are you dressed like that?

05:32.417 --> 05:34.000
Why are you dressed like that?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.792
Because I haven't had a
chance to do the laundry.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.000
Believe it or not, this is your shirt,
your Dad's sweats,

05:39.083 --> 05:42.250
and you don't even wanna know
whose underwear I have on.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.917
- They're PJ's.
- You don't know that.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.417
I can see Batman's head on the waistband.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.542
What is that smell?

05:48.625 --> 05:50.166
That's my new body spray.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.500
Check it out.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.166
"Duude".

05:55.250 --> 05:57.458
With two Us.

05:58.667 --> 06:02.875
Body spray for cool dudes ages 12 to 13.

06:03.709 --> 06:04.917
What's all this about?

06:05.000 --> 06:05.875
Nothing.

06:07.208 --> 06:09.500
Oh, and by the way,
for the next couple of days,

06:09.583 --> 06:12.291
I'm gonna be working on a project
with a kid from summer school.

06:12.375 --> 06:16.667
Oh, I see. Is this kid a boy kid
or a girl kid?

06:16.834 --> 06:17.917
I don't remember.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.125
When I'm at school I'm all about the work.

06:20.417 --> 06:21.667
Aw.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.959
My little baby has a crush.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.417
Honey, can I give you some advice?

06:25.834 --> 06:29.333
I'm 13 now.
I don't need any help from my mommy.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.375
That's a direct quote from
the "Duude" commercial.

06:34.917 --> 06:35.750
Get out!

06:36.458 --> 06:37.750
Okay.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.500
I got all dressed up for nothing?

06:46.291 --> 06:47.333
Hi, Gabe.

06:47.417 --> 06:48.333
Hi, Jade.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.709
I like hanging out at your house.
It's always so nice and peaceful.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.959
Mary Lou: You did what?
Without even asking me?

07:12.041 --> 07:13.792
Harry, you come back here!

07:13.875 --> 07:16.583
Girls, I have some exciting news.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.959
Your father quit his job,

07:19.041 --> 07:22.166
took our life savings,
and bought a restaurant.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.083
I combined both my passions

07:24.166 --> 07:27.208
and created the world's
first weather-themed eatery.

07:27.542 --> 07:30.208
Hurricane Harry's Weather Cafe.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.166
And I owe it all to Teddy.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.083
What did I do?

07:33.166 --> 07:35.083
You did this.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.000
And we're all gonna work there.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.208
Me? What did I do?

07:41.291 --> 07:43.375
Well, you wanted jobs? Now you got them.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.500
- That's okay, Mr. Wentz..
- Oh, no, no, Teddy.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.583
You are going to be a part of this, too.

07:47.667 --> 07:51.667
Because of you, this family
is taking a ride on the crazy train.

07:51.750 --> 07:54.083
All aboard.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.667
Hmm.

08:09.917 --> 08:10.917
Ah.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.041
Okay.

08:13.291 --> 08:16.834
Charlie, I've made some adjustments.
Your trike is now much more aerodynamic.

08:16.917 --> 08:18.125
Where's my bell?

08:18.208 --> 08:20.333
Oh, you don't need a bell,
you'll be in front the whole time.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.792
Right?

08:22.333 --> 08:23.250
Yes.

08:24.333 --> 08:25.750
Well, well, well.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.208
You here to back out?

08:27.250 --> 08:29.000
No, I'm here to show you a preview

08:29.083 --> 08:31.166
of what you're gonna see
tomorrow after the race.

08:31.458 --> 08:32.625
My victory dance.

08:32.709 --> 08:34.417
Uh! You like that?

08:34.750 --> 08:35.667
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.250
- Well, I got a victory dance, too.
- Where's it at?

08:37.375 --> 08:38.709
Goes a little something like this.

08:38.792 --> 08:40.041
That's okay, you like this?

08:41.542 --> 08:43.041
Oh, yes.

08:48.375 --> 08:52.083
All right, everybody,
we open in five minutes.

08:52.583 --> 08:53.709
Where's Mother nature?

08:53.792 --> 08:55.041
Here I am.

08:56.875 --> 09:00.291
Oh, Mary Lou, you look stunning.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.041
Oh, you know what?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.834
I thought this would be silly,
but I must say,

09:04.917 --> 09:06.333
I do make it work.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.625
All right,
where are my special waitresses?

09:10.709 --> 09:12.208
Sunny and Cloudy?

09:12.250 --> 09:13.166
Ivy: Here we are.

09:26.959 --> 09:28.125
So..

09:29.458 --> 09:32.583
Kind of a bummer
having to go to summer school, right?

09:33.166 --> 09:34.417
I like summer school.

09:38.041 --> 09:38.959
Me too.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.667
When I said bummer, I meant bummer !

09:42.917 --> 09:46.041
You can't change the meaning of a word
by just saying it differently.

09:47.917 --> 09:48.625
Bummer.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.000
Um..

09:52.417 --> 09:53.333
I'll be right back.

09:57.709 --> 09:58.667
Hey.

09:59.792 --> 10:01.542
How's it going out there, tiger?

10:02.041 --> 10:04.917
Terrible. I keep saying the wrong thing.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.208
Well.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.041
I know how you can win her over
without saying a single word.

10:12.291 --> 10:14.750
The baby? How is he gonna help me?

10:14.834 --> 10:18.542
Once she sees how great you are with Toby,

10:18.625 --> 10:21.250
she is guaranteed to melt.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.166
Now...

10:23.458 --> 10:24.583
Hold him close.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.208
Cradle the head.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.291
I hope you're better with girls
than my older brother.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.709
Jade, I don't think
you've met my baby brother.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.041
This is Toby.

10:37.458 --> 10:40.166
Oh my gosh, he's so cute.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.667
And you're so good with him.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.250
The trick is to cradle the head.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.083
Here, have some more rain.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.041
That's what we call water.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.792
Isn't that fun?

11:03.542 --> 11:06.875
Martin, party of four,
your table is ready.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.333
This is Hurricane Harry
with a special bulletin.

11:16.417 --> 11:19.917
The forecast for the next few minutes
is entertaining.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.625
Ladies and gentlemen,
the musical stylings of

11:22.709 --> 11:24.542
Wentz's Weather Girls.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.250
Hit it.

11:33.041 --> 11:36.959
♪ Hurricane Harry's
Is the spot doo-dah, doo-dah ♪

11:37.041 --> 11:40.709
♪ We serve our dishes cold and hot
All the doo-dah day ♪

11:40.792 --> 11:41.709
♪ And night ♪

11:53.542 --> 11:56.834
Wentz's Weather Girls.

11:56.917 --> 12:01.166
And they'll be back to do it again
every hour on the hour.

12:02.792 --> 12:05.166
I liked it better when I didn't know
what my Dad did.

12:12.875 --> 12:15.333
Think we're dry enough to go in yet?

12:17.625 --> 12:18.667
Nope.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.417
Still squishing.

12:21.917 --> 12:22.792
Hey.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.667
What hit us during that last storm?
Was that sleet?

12:25.917 --> 12:29.125
No. Kid threw a bowl
of nachos into the fan.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.166
We gotta quit this job.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.333
We can't.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.875
Your mom would kill me
and your dad would be crushed.

12:35.959 --> 12:40.417
Well, if he adds an earthquake tomorrow,
we might actually be crushed.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.875
Wait, we can't quit.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.583
But we could get fired.

12:48.625 --> 12:49.542
Yeah.

12:50.125 --> 12:52.458
Ooh, I don't know
what you're thinking, but I like it.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.750
Hey, do you mind
if we take a break for a second?

13:01.834 --> 13:02.667
Why?

13:02.750 --> 13:05.417
There's just this thing I do
for my baby brother.

13:05.792 --> 13:08.375
I share life lessons and give him advice.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.542
I call it a video diary.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.166
That is the sweetest thing ever.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.500
I get that a lot.

13:17.583 --> 13:18.834
Hey, Char...

13:18.917 --> 13:20.041
Toby.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.709
It's your big brother Gabe here

13:24.792 --> 13:27.875
with another one
of my signature video diaries.

13:28.458 --> 13:32.750
Anyway, last night after I tucked you in
and kissed you on your head,

13:33.083 --> 13:34.625
I sang you to sleep with a song.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.041
Oh, can you sing it now?

13:37.083 --> 13:37.917
Please?

13:39.625 --> 13:40.542
Um.

13:41.875 --> 13:45.583
♪ Hush, little Toby go to sleep ♪

13:46.000 --> 13:49.583
♪ You're already asleep
So stay asleep ♪

13:51.792 --> 13:55.834
♪ La, la, la... ♪

13:55.917 --> 13:56.834
♪ Sleep ♪

13:59.500 --> 14:04.375
♪ Sleepy sleep, sleepy sleep sleep
Sleep, sleep ♪

14:07.166 --> 14:08.250
Aw.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.709
Well, that's all for now,
so, I'll just say..

14:13.500 --> 14:14.583
Good...

14:14.834 --> 14:16.291
fortune, Toby.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.417
That's sort of my trademark.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.542
Now, remember, Charlie.
Winning isn't everything.

14:27.625 --> 14:30.834
- That's the only thing.
- Yes. Yes.

14:32.625 --> 14:35.458
Okay, you know that shame
you felt for the last two years?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.166
It ends today.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.333
Or it could get worse
depending on how this goes.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.250
Okay.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.333
The race is to that lamppost and back.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.333
First trike to cross the finish line wins.

14:46.667 --> 14:47.959
Wins what?

14:49.333 --> 14:51.667
- Hey, Dad.
- What is going on?

14:51.750 --> 14:52.792
Nothing.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.917
We're just...
We're just... hanging out at the park.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.917
Then why have the kids
got numbers on them?

14:59.208 --> 15:01.500
Because we're teaching
them their ones and twos.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.667
How many times have we been over this?

15:04.750 --> 15:07.250
You cannot race children like horses.

15:07.583 --> 15:08.917
Can we race them like dogs?

15:10.250 --> 15:11.792
You can't race them at all.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.917
All right, kids, come on.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.417
Hey, who wants to go to the playground?

15:15.667 --> 15:17.083
Bob: Huh? Okay, come on.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.834
Man!

15:20.375 --> 15:21.959
I was all fired up for a race today.

15:22.041 --> 15:22.917
Yeah, me too.

15:26.250 --> 15:29.959
You know, we could still have a race.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.125
Where's Toby?

15:39.625 --> 15:40.709
Dad took him to the park.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.250
What?

15:42.333 --> 15:45.041
No, no, Jade's about to leave
and I need to make a move.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.375
So make your move.

15:46.458 --> 15:47.834
I don't have a move.

15:49.709 --> 15:50.625
I need Toby.

15:50.709 --> 15:52.375
She likes it
when I do nice things for him.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.709
Jade: Gabe, I'm leaving.

15:54.041 --> 15:54.959
Wait!

15:58.834 --> 15:59.917
Hey.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
So...

16:03.375 --> 16:04.333
Um...

16:05.208 --> 16:06.250
Uh...

16:06.667 --> 16:09.000
I was just wondering if...

16:09.959 --> 16:11.959
You wanted to go to a movie
with me sometime?

16:12.041 --> 16:13.125
Oh...

16:13.417 --> 16:14.625
Um...

16:14.709 --> 16:16.041
No, thank you.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.333
But I thought you were kinda into me?

16:19.417 --> 16:21.291
Yeah, as a friend but...

16:21.583 --> 16:23.125
I could never date you.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.750
I like bad boys.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.417
What... But I am a bad boy.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.542
I was just kidding about
all that baby stuff.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.041
Gabe, be proud of who you are.

16:34.417 --> 16:37.250
A sweet, sensitive, good boy.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.208
No. I'm not. I'm a total jerk, ask anyone.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.000
Sweetie-pie.

16:44.792 --> 16:49.458
This blanket you knit for the baby
is absolutely precious.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.542
Bye, Gabe.

17:39.875 --> 17:40.834
Whoa!

18:07.375 --> 18:09.667
Whoo! Yes! Yes!

18:09.750 --> 18:10.792
Watch this!

18:28.333 --> 18:30.625
Well, that brings us
to the top of the hour

18:30.709 --> 18:33.041
which means that it's time
to give it up again

18:33.125 --> 18:35.166
for Wentz's Weather Girls.

18:39.917 --> 18:41.333
You ready to get fired?

18:41.417 --> 18:42.375
Hit it.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.291
I guess that was a bad idea.

19:07.375 --> 19:08.959
We've ruined everything.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.959
If you have to make some tough choices,
we understand.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.875
And I'm talking about firing us.

19:20.417 --> 19:23.709
That was awesome!

19:29.792 --> 19:31.458
My weather girls.

19:31.542 --> 19:34.166
We are going to be together forever.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.250
Well, what do you know.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.750
My boys.

19:50.291 --> 19:51.333
Gabe: Yeah.

19:51.417 --> 19:53.959
He woke up from his nap
so we're just hanging out.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.291
You know who Toby reminds me of?

19:59.208 --> 20:00.166
You.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.417
Because he doesn't have a girlfriend?

20:03.291 --> 20:04.417
No.

20:05.083 --> 20:08.709
Because you both have
that sparkle in your eyes.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.041
Amy: And that's another thing girls like.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.458
A sparkle.

20:13.583 --> 20:14.375
Thanks, Mom.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.583
Well, since you're watching Toby,

20:17.667 --> 20:20.625
you don't, um, mind
if I take a nap, do you?

20:20.709 --> 20:22.959
Well, I... I guess, but if he...

20:25.041 --> 20:26.041
Mom?

20:36.166 --> 20:37.917
Hey, Toby. Gabe here.

20:38.083 --> 20:41.166
So, I wanna tell you everything
that I've learned about girls.

20:42.959 --> 20:43.959
That's it.

20:45.667 --> 20:49.291
Anyway, if you ever need
any advice in the future...

20:49.375 --> 20:51.291
Wait. What... What are you doing?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.917
Making a video diary for Toby.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.417
Well, that's kind of my thing.

20:56.625 --> 20:57.667
Not any more.

20:57.959 --> 20:58.917
So...

21:00.709 --> 21:04.792
The next time I have a crush on a girl,
wish me good fortune, Toby.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.750
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

21:09.417 --> 21:10.250
Jealous?

21:10.333 --> 21:11.834
What? No. Confused.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.792
What does "good fortune, Toby" even mean?

21:13.875 --> 21:17.625
It means that Toby has the good fortune
not to hear "good luck, Charlie".

21:19.000 --> 21:20.375
Okay, give me my camera.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.625
Good fortune, Toby.

21:21.709 --> 21:22.750
Good luck, Charlie.

21:34.166 --> 21:36.166
Whoo. What a ride.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.000
You know, after a workout like that,

21:39.083 --> 21:41.875
I don't want some kind
of kiddie bubble bath.

21:41.959 --> 21:44.208
I'm 12 to 13 now.

21:44.917 --> 21:47.750
I want a body spray
that works as hard as I do.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.125
That's why I use Duude.

21:51.041 --> 21:54.041
Duude, when you don't need help
from your Mommy any more.

21:55.542 --> 21:58.959
Announcer: Duude, from the makers
of Guy and Bro.
