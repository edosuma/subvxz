I'll tiptoe anywhere you want.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.256

I mean, there's hundreds

09:21.299 --> 09:22.779

Edgar Torres dead.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.128
- Hundreds who'd want him dead,

09:24.172 --> 09:25.565
but only a few
who would have access.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.870
And the guy was old school--
no phones,

09:26.914 --> 09:28.219
did business face to face.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.047
- That's why the DEA
never got close to him.

09:30.091 --> 09:32.136
15 years they had Torres ID'd.
They could never find a way

09:32.180 --> 09:33.921

Guy was a ghost.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.792

on the inside.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.359

in his inner circle.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.882

09:38.926 --> 09:41.842
- Yeah, people who
would never roll.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.715
Carlos Mendoza, 56 years old.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.761
Been in Chicago
for the past 30.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.676
DEA caught him up
seven years ago,

09:49.719 --> 09:51.112

09:51.155 --> 09:52.940

grilled him,

09:52.983 --> 09:54.158

absolutely nothing.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.247
Carlos never said a word.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.032
- All right,
so where's Carlos now?

09:58.075 --> 10:00.643
- Lives right here in Chicago.
Lives alone in Fuller Park.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.166
Also has two adult sons.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.038
- But we still believe
he's involved with the cartel.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.170
Gets paid every week

Pinged a tower outside
Colima, Mexico a few days ago.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.742
Matches Jane Doe's
GPS coordinates to a T.
