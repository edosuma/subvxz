02:41.452 --> 02:42.704
Yeah, apparently.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.081
It's fine. I'm ignoring her.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.501
Ask you what about keeping Pinecrest wild?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.795
The annual Davis family fundraiser.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.381
The money raised goes to preserve wildlife

02:53.464 --> 02:55.633

02:55.717 --> 02:57.802
-Except for my dad, of course.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.262
Sounds like a blast.

You like these shirts?

03:00.763 --> 03:02.682
Mandy also made us matching hats.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.100
God, she bugs me.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.685
Let's just skate.

03:06.144 --> 03:06.978
Okay.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.148
So Dasha wants us to work on the opening

03:56.069 --> 03:57.278
Thank you. I didn't realize.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.489
You need to get better
at tracking me, Kat.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.865
I'm trying, okay?

04:00.949 --> 04:01.908
I'm just...

04:01.991 --> 04:04.118
I'm used to skating alone.
I need time to adjust.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.163
I'm not trying to freak you out,
but our senior pair test is in two weeks.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.249
If we don't pass,
we don't compete at Regionals.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.376
Our whole competition season will be done.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.127
Look, just--

04:13.211 --> 04:14.087
How do I learn?

04:14.170 --> 04:17.799
I don't know. It's just instinctive.
It's about being in sync, anticipating,

04:17.882 --> 04:21.552
knowing what's in the other person's head
without them having to say anything.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.346
It's like having really great s--

04:23.429 --> 04:24.889
Okay. Yeah, I get it.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.395
Give me a second.

04:30.895 --> 04:31.896
Okay.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.526
How am I supposed to focus
with you staring at me?

04:36.609 --> 04:39.404
What are you even doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work? It's Friday.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.491
Well, I'm only working the night shift now
so I can be here for your sister.

You never did want me to watch you skate.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.960
Serena always begged for me to be here,
but you never did.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.421
You like to be alone.

What are you even saying?

[sighs] I just--

05:02.552 --> 05:04.345
I don't know
if you're a pair skater, honey.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.181
I mean, you can't even track your partner.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.433
I'm learning.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.475
I can learn.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.646
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I don't think
you can learn to connect with someone.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.898
Isn't tracking basically that?

05:18.192 --> 05:19.569
It's okay. You're a lone wolf.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.321
Just like me.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.114
What are you doing?

05:24.198 --> 05:26.242
Why are you even saying this to me?

05:26.951 --> 05:29.287
-Because I care about you.
-Bullshit!

05:29.370 --> 05:31.497
The only thing you care about is you.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.167
You always put yourself first.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.084
Always.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.256
If that's what you need to believe...

05:40.757 --> 05:41.716
Fuck this.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.843
I am gonna learn how to track.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.756
Just in case it wasn't clear,
this is stupid.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.467
You've done far stupider things.

06:24.550 --> 06:28.137

a nice, continuous rhythm.

06:43.611 --> 06:47.407
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like
being forced to emote or whatever.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.076
Now I'm annoyed that I had to say "emote."

06:50.159 --> 06:51.202
Justin,

06:51.285 --> 06:52.620
I need this to work.

06:54.038 --> 06:54.872
Please.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.916
[teacher] Okay, good.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.585
Now it's time for the Meisner technique.

06:59.669 --> 07:03.047
The next piece is for you and your partner
to connect emotionally.

07:03.131 --> 07:07.260
So one of you will start by saying
whatever's going on between you right now,

07:07.802 --> 07:10.012
and the other will repeat it.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.932
Eventually, the words are gonna fade
into the background,

07:13.015 --> 07:16.018
and the emotions will just take over.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.061
[teacher] Have a go.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.855
[both sigh]

07:18.938 --> 07:23.025
Okay, so what is happening right now is...

07:23.818 --> 07:24.819
you look unhappy.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.029
I look unhappy.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.533
Because you're having trouble tracking me.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.703
Because I'm having trouble tracking you.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.830
Or connecting on the ice.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.624
Or connecting on the ice.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.043
And I can't figure out why.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.714
You can't figure out why.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.177
'Cause usually, I connect with everyone.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.013
Everyone you fuck?

07:53.347 --> 07:56.350
-[scoffs] Everyone except you, apparently.
-Uh, okay.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.936

if you tried not to be so--

07:59.020 --> 08:00.396
-So what?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.814

08:01.898 --> 08:03.900
Shutting me out,
like you do with everybody. Like--

08:03.983 --> 08:05.359
Like I'm a lone wolf?

08:06.527 --> 08:07.528
Fuck my mother.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.280
-Fuck you!
-What?

08:09.363 --> 08:11.365
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-You're right.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.367
-This is stupid.
-Kat.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.666
-Hi, ladies.
-Hey, hey, hey.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.211
You know that digging
you asked me to do on Mitch?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.462
-Ssh!
-[coach] Greater edges!

08:24.545 --> 08:25.713
Right, sorry.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.050
Well, I talked to my source in Boise.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.053
This girl would only need one glass of cab
before she spilled state secrets.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.723
Oh, speaking of, did you see that Hutchins
finally expanded their wine section?

08:35.806 --> 08:37.475
-Now we don't have to drive--
-Focus!

08:38.142 --> 08:39.602
What's the deal with Mitch?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.479
Turns out he's a saint.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.523
His student back in Boise,
the one who dropped him,

08:43.606 --> 08:46.150
it's because she got an eating disorder
and not the good kind.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.068
I already knew that.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.111
-[coach] Strong landing!
-What else?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.947
Well, a few weeks after that,

08:51.030 --> 08:54.742
he finds out his wife's stepping out
on him with some plumber or something.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.662
So his <i>wife's </i>the cheater?

08:57.745 --> 08:58.704
Yup.

08:58.788 --> 09:02.208
In the same month,
he loses his best skater <i>and </i>his wife.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.752
Very sad. Very, very sad.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.129
Yeah, the saddest.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.132
So that's it? Nothing else?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.717
Nothing else.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.970
Why are you so interested in Mitch?

09:14.053 --> 09:14.887

09:19.308 --> 09:22.979
Holy shit! Did Serena just land
a triple flip double toe?

09:23.062 --> 09:25.231
Harley didn't even tell me
she was working on that.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.858
I guess all the money
I'm giving Mitch is paying off.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.778

09:31.862 --> 09:33.573

10:05.896 --> 10:07.690
Um, nice triple flip double toe.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.985
Yeah, wow, Serena. You're just
a little jumping bean out there.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.196

-[woman] You know, we were all worried

10:14.280 --> 10:16.198
about your artistic score
dragging you down,

10:16.282 --> 10:18.659
but those jumps of yours
will really help make up for that.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.411
See you tomorrow, honey. Come on.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.431
I promise I can make a decision.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.600
Can I just get till the end of the day,
please?

So, are you skiing in the fundraiser
this year?

11:16.842 --> 11:19.220
I raised 10K
for the ski-a-thon portion already.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.264
-I guess I'm very sponsorable.
-I believe it.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.059
And we make a pretty good team.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.396
-You think?
-I think.

11:32.024 --> 11:32.900
Hey.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.736
You wanna go to this thing with me?

11:36.320 --> 11:37.488
I can watch you ski.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.281
It could be fun.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.244
Nah, it's okay.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.163
It's okay?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.167
Kat, I've asked you
to come watch me ski before.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.877
I've asked you out before.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.213
And even when you say yes,
you don't show up.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.924
It happened again at Justin's party.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.428
I just feel like
you're gaslighting me here.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.140
Well...

12:05.766 --> 12:06.642
okay.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.479
I'm gonna go get the other sign.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.112
[Kat sighs] So my mom was right.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.406
I shut everybody out.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.616
My skating partner,

12:23.117 --> 12:24.076
my best friend,

12:25.703 --> 12:27.621
even Marcus. [sighs]

12:28.080 --> 12:29.457
I guess what I'm saying is,

12:30.249 --> 12:31.500
I'm gonna die alone.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.963
[woman] That's the kind of
all-or-nothing mentality we try to avoid.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.841
There's a middle ground, isn't there?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.050
With my mom?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.262
With bipolar? [inhales]

12:43.345 --> 12:44.597
[sighs] I don't see it.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.724
Well, let's be clear.

12:47.183 --> 12:51.520
The boundaries you set for yourself
aren't because of your bipolar disorder.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.439
Well, it certainly doesn't help.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.776
Kat, the challenge of being raised
by your mother

12:56.859 --> 12:58.778
is why you needed to protect yourself.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.404
But you're an adult.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.239
You're out of your mom's house now.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.409
You can stop shutting yourself off
from people.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.995
[woman] Yeah. I mean, she might be
out of her mom's house,

13:08.078 --> 13:10.998
but even when Carol's not there,
she's still gotta be in Kat's head.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.750
Thank you. Thanks, Alison.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.505
Now, the point that I was getting to
is that...

13:18.297 --> 13:20.508
you can't let a coping mechanism

13:20.591 --> 13:22.259
become something you hide behind.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.805
You deserve a real connection
in your life.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.390

13:28.808 --> 13:30.017

13:30.100 --> 13:31.602
[Alison] You know. Propose marriage.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.690
[therapist] Like open yourself up.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.442

13:38.901 --> 13:40.069

13:40.820 --> 13:42.363
[sighs] I tried.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.406
He turned me down.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.700
[therapist] That's probably
'cause he was scared too.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.703
You're not the only one
who's afraid of connecting.

You wouldn't understand.

15:11.702 --> 15:12.703
You're right.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.079
I'm not a skater.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.915
I don't train with you every day.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.551

15:28.385 --> 15:29.678
Mitch could leave at any minute,

15:29.762 --> 15:33.223
and if Mary-Ann is right about
my artistic scores, then I'm screwed.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.811
Mary-Ann wouldn't know artistry
if it bit her in the face.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.522
Come to think of it, it kinda looks like

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
-something bit her in her face.
-[Serena chuckles]

15:44.652 --> 15:46.362
Yeah, totally. [laughs]

15:49.490 --> 15:52.368
Honestly, I hate telling you this
because you're my fucking competition,

15:52.451 --> 15:55.537
but the only reason
Mary-Ann insulted you was...

15:56.372 --> 15:57.957
because you've become a threat.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.585
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.796
I mean, if my dad found out

25:28.443 --> 25:30.946
Seriously, I'm not sure
I can lift another ski,

25:31.029 --> 25:33.114
never mind finish the competition season.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.408
-I'm not that kind of pill guy.
-Uh-huh.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.120
Look, you don't have to keep skating.
You know that, right?

25:39.204 --> 25:40.413
Just...

25:40.497 --> 25:42.582
tell your dad. I'm sure he'll understand.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.377
Whatever. Thanks for trying to help.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.337
You know,

25:48.088 --> 25:50.674
you're not as much of an asshole
as everyone thinks.

25:59.891 --> 26:00.976
-Hey, man.
-Two beers.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.365
What are skaters still doing here?

26:15.448 --> 26:17.826
-Yeah, don't we have the ice now?
-Car pool's late.

26:18.326 --> 26:20.912
-[Reid] You're Kat's sister, right?
-Yeah.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.623
All right.
Our sister is your brother's partner.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.002
No, it's the other way around.
Justin is our brother.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.337
-[Drew] That's what I said.
-[laughing] Cool.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.257
-You don't really look like Kat.
-We have different dads.

26:32.340 --> 26:33.174
That's cool.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.426
Our mom's dead.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.678
-Why would you say that?
-Um...

26:37.220 --> 26:38.888
[Reid] Don't say stuff like that!

26:39.347 --> 26:40.640
That's my ride.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.850
Rides are cool.

26:42.767 --> 26:44.561
Hey, we should hang out sometime.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.354
Okay. Sure.

26:46.855 --> 26:47.772
Tic Tac?

26:50.108 --> 26:50.942
Thanks.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.361
[Serena giggling]

27:08.668 --> 27:10.587
You know, Serena, I really admire you

27:10.670 --> 27:13.006
for putting in all that extra work
at the ballet bar today.

27:13.089 --> 27:13.923
Mom!

27:14.007 --> 27:15.675
I know you wanted to go to that ski thing,

27:15.759 --> 27:18.678
but sometimes we need to make sacrifices

27:18.762 --> 27:21.389
when we wanna be taken seriously
during competition season.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.682
Am I right, honey?

27:24.309 --> 27:25.435
Thanks for the ride.

27:29.898 --> 27:30.899
[door slams]

27:33.610 --> 27:34.444
Oh.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.739
Your new haircut looks really cute,
by the way.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.658
Makes your face look way less puffy.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.660
Like, way less.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.338
[Kat chuckles]

27:54.005 --> 27:54.923
You want another one?

27:55.006 --> 27:56.383
Hm... I wish.

27:56.966 --> 27:57.967
Early skate tomorrow.

28:00.553 --> 28:01.763
Hey, can I ask you a question?

28:01.846 --> 28:02.764
Sure.

28:03.807 --> 28:05.100
How'd you know it was worth it?

28:05.850 --> 28:08.103
Becoming a pair skater
instead of going to London.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.646
It's a pretty big risk.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.316
I guess if you love something,
it's worth it.

28:17.862 --> 28:18.697
No.

28:20.073 --> 28:20.907
That's bullshit.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.786
It's not really about love for me.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.707
Skating's like...

28:31.000 --> 28:32.168
It's like breathing.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.421
You know?

28:35.130 --> 28:37.048
I don't particularly enjoy it,

28:38.174 --> 28:40.176
but I can't imagine not doing it.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.681
And if I stopped,

28:47.100 --> 28:48.309
it'd feel like...

28:51.855 --> 28:52.897
like drowning.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.316
Well,

28:55.817 --> 28:57.652
that metaphor got dark real fast.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.154
[laughs]

28:59.237 --> 29:00.905
I know, but...

29:03.116 --> 29:04.451
it's the truth.

29:10.665 --> 29:11.791
[Justin] Hey, man!

29:11.875 --> 29:13.334
I heard you skied really well today.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.921
And you poured a mean beer, bro.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.133
-Can I talk to you?
-I'm in the middle of something.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.217
That's cool.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.719
I can wait.

29:25.388 --> 29:26.431
It's okay. It's okay.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.433
I'll just meet up with you in a minute.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.436
Gotta make a phone call, anyway.

29:36.649 --> 29:37.650
[sighs]

29:41.237 --> 29:44.240
Look, just so you know,
I'm not an asshole.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.785
In fact, someone just told me
I wasn't a few minutes ago.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.161
[Kat] Congratulations.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.078
[Justin] Thanks.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.414
Because, to be clear,
I'm friendly as fuck.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.168
And all those girls I slept with,
the ones you brought up in acting class,

29:55.251 --> 29:58.922
I connected with all of them.
They all came back for more, so, uh...

30:00.089 --> 30:01.758
[Justin] If we're not tracking...

30:02.592 --> 30:04.260
-it's not me.
-Oh, my God!

30:04.344 --> 30:05.220
What?

30:05.303 --> 30:07.013
This isn't about skating at all, is it?

30:07.096 --> 30:09.557
-What are you talking about?
-No, this is about your pride.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.727
We slept together,
and I didn't come back for more.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.687
-That is so not it, Kat.
-It totally is!

30:14.771 --> 30:18.066
Your toxic male ego is out of control.

30:18.441 --> 30:19.526
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:21.236 --> 30:22.654
This isn't working.

30:22.737 --> 30:23.905
It's not fun anymore.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.282
-I'm out.
-What?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.452
What the fuck?

30:37.252 --> 30:38.962
I'm gonna-- Sorry.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.472
[Mandy] Justin Davis!

30:49.556 --> 30:52.058
Oh, great!
Someone else to come tell me I'm a dick.

30:53.101 --> 30:54.143
[cowbell ringing]

30:55.520 --> 30:56.479
Did you just--

30:56.563 --> 30:57.689
Did you throw that at me?

30:57.772 --> 30:59.607
-Maybe.
-What the hell?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.609
It's, like, made of brass, Mandy!

31:01.693 --> 31:02.861
I missed, didn't I?

31:02.944 --> 31:03.945
[scoffs]

31:04.571 --> 31:06.155
Why are you even here?

31:07.156 --> 31:10.034
This isn't your event.
My mom started it. It was her event.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.870
Do you think I like
trudging through the snow,

31:11.953 --> 31:13.329
handing out cowbells?

31:14.330 --> 31:15.957
I'm here because I love your father.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.333
Love is money.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.212
[sighs] It's getting real old

31:21.296 --> 31:23.756
letting your bad attitude
just roll off my back.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.509
But I guess I'm stuck with you.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.095
Kat isn't.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.140
Heard you called it off with her.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.474
It's my business.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.939
You know, your dad said that
he's finally seen the light in your eyes

31:40.023 --> 31:41.774
since you've been skating with Kat.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.486
Said he hasn't seen it
since your mom died.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.697
Feeling a country song coming on here.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.077
You can push me away all you want...

31:53.870 --> 31:55.455
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

31:56.039 --> 31:59.709
But don't let being afraid
to actually feel something again...

32:00.668 --> 32:02.879
for Kat, for skating...

32:04.255 --> 32:05.798
make you lose both.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.971
And you're not a dick, Justin,

32:12.722 --> 32:15.683
but you do a damn good job
of acting like one sometimes.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.439
[sighs]

32:24.776 --> 32:26.277
[knocking]

32:43.127 --> 32:44.128
[Kat sighs]

32:47.548 --> 32:49.175
You look like you could use him.

32:57.475 --> 32:58.601
Am I like Mom?

32:59.978 --> 33:00.895
What?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.189
God, no.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.108
You've said it before.

33:05.191 --> 33:06.985
Yeah, well, I say a lot of things.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.532
You take your meds, right?

33:13.658 --> 33:17.912
And you don't, like, sleep with every guy
who buys you a plate of chicken wings,

33:17.996 --> 33:18.871
so...

33:19.747 --> 33:20.915
you've got it together.

33:21.457 --> 33:22.375
Mostly.

33:26.295 --> 33:28.131
-[sighs]
-What'd she do this time?

33:31.384 --> 33:33.886
She didn't <i>do </i>anything.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.014
She was just right...

33:37.140 --> 33:38.141
about me.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.524
I tried to prove her wrong.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.110
To put myself out there

33:49.193 --> 33:53.781
and try to open up
and let someone in for once, and...

33:55.324 --> 33:56.909
it all just bit me in the ass.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.411
What happened?

33:59.996 --> 34:00.830
[sighs]

34:00.913 --> 34:02.165
I was on a date with Marcus.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.208
It was actually...

34:05.960 --> 34:07.086
really nice.

34:08.963 --> 34:09.797
But then,

34:10.298 --> 34:12.800
you know, I thought
I had everything under control,

34:12.884 --> 34:14.552
and suddenly, Justin just--

34:15.011 --> 34:16.012
[scoffs]

34:16.095 --> 34:17.680
I think he just broke up our partnership.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.265
[laughs]

34:22.268 --> 34:23.519
Why are you laughing?

34:23.978 --> 34:25.938
Oh, come on. Can't you see it?

34:26.773 --> 34:28.566
This is not a Mom thing.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.984
It's a guy thing.

34:30.068 --> 34:34.072
Like, two super-hot guys are into you.

34:34.155 --> 34:34.989
Boo-hoo!

34:35.073 --> 34:35.948
No, Justin's not--

34:36.032 --> 34:37.408
Justin's not what?

34:38.367 --> 34:41.204
Come on.
He's acting like a jealous boyfriend, Kat.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.251
I don't know what Justin's deal is.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.003
All I know is that...

34:50.004 --> 34:52.590
if I don't have a partner,
I can't skate anymore.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.343
And I need to skate.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.594
Really?

34:57.720 --> 34:59.430
'Cause I just want a boyfriend.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.681
[snorts]

35:04.185 --> 35:05.186
Will you stay?

35:06.813 --> 35:08.064
Just for a little bit.

35:31.504 --> 35:34.173
I told Mary-Ann she had a fat face.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.178
She probably deserved it.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.224
Thanks.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.651
Hey, have you seen Kat?

35:53.734 --> 35:54.694
Sorry, man.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.655
Stepped out to make a phone call,
and she just disappeared.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.449
Got something I need to tell her.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.203
I decided to join the ski team.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.164
Whoo! [laughs]

36:06.247 --> 36:07.081
Yeah, you did.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.084
Yup. Just turned down
Stanford Med School to do it.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.294
Wait. What?

36:11.919 --> 36:15.548
You turned down Stanford Medical School
to ski?

36:16.007 --> 36:18.426
-My parents would be so proud.
-[laughs]

36:18.509 --> 36:21.095
Well, hey. If it doesn't work out,
you can always go back.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.680
Actually, I can't.

36:23.097 --> 36:26.350
I was only supposed to take one year off
after college. It's been two.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.352
They won't let me defer anymore.

36:29.645 --> 36:30.646
Damn, bro.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.273
That was really stupid.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.274
[laughs]

36:33.357 --> 36:34.192
Yeah.

36:34.692 --> 36:35.985
But I can't imagine not skiing.

36:36.068 --> 36:38.196
-Yeah.
-Hope it's worth the risk.

36:39.447 --> 36:40.823
Hey, I'm gonna try and find Kat.

36:40.907 --> 36:44.327
Or we could celebrate you
finally joining the team?

36:44.410 --> 36:45.745
Come on. One run.

36:45.828 --> 36:46.954
I don't know.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.041
Nope, you've never said no
to night skiing before. We're doing it.

36:54.587 --> 36:55.922
[cell phone buzzing]

36:58.299 --> 36:59.550
Oh, shit!

37:09.477 --> 37:11.020
[cell phone buzzing]

37:35.878 --> 37:38.047
Jenny! Come. Have some tea.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.257
I'm good.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.092
I...

37:41.175 --> 37:43.177
was hoping I could talk to you guys
about something.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.263
Oh, uh...

37:45.680 --> 37:49.016
Actually, we have something
to tell you too.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.019
Remember that jumps coach you wanted?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.437
And a choreographer?

37:54.021 --> 37:54.855
Yeah?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.024
-Well, they start tomorrow.
-[chuckles]

37:57.108 --> 37:58.234
What do you mean?

37:58.317 --> 37:59.694
We hired them last week.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.862
[mother] They're the best, right?
That's what you said.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.323
Yeah, but you said
they were too expensive,

38:04.407 --> 38:06.284
especially with the new franchise.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.618
That's the big news, honey.

38:07.702 --> 38:11.580
We have decided
to hold off on our plan to expand.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.624
That's-- Wow! [laughs]

38:14.583 --> 38:15.543
You guys.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.838
You shouldn't have. I mean,

38:19.505 --> 38:22.508
the new store,
that's been in the works for so long...

38:22.591 --> 38:23.718
Hey.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.137
There's time for that down the road.

38:27.221 --> 38:28.556
This is your year.

38:29.140 --> 38:29.974
Hm?

38:30.891 --> 38:31.726
Pa...

38:32.476 --> 38:33.311
Ma...

38:35.104 --> 38:36.480
[speaking foreign language]

38:37.356 --> 38:39.025
We're so proud of you.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.917
-[Carol] Welcome to my humble abode.
-I love your abode.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.419
[laughing]

39:02.048 --> 39:03.883
[Carol] Hm! Oh! Ssh!

39:03.966 --> 39:05.509
-Serena's sleeping.
-Okay!

39:08.721 --> 39:11.140
-["Scheherazade" playing]
-[baby crying]

39:16.395 --> 39:18.230
[baby continues crying]

39:23.444 --> 39:25.071
[George] There you go, Katarina.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.792
[music stops]

39:37.875 --> 39:39.335
[panting]

39:42.671 --> 39:43.631
George!

39:45.925 --> 39:46.967
Stop.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.427
Okay, okay. What?

39:49.303 --> 39:50.888
-Okay.
-Sorry.

39:51.972 --> 39:52.932
I just--

39:53.933 --> 39:54.934
I'm sorry.

39:55.601 --> 39:56.894
I want to. It's just--

39:58.354 --> 39:59.230
I mean, look at you.

39:59.313 --> 40:00.147
I just--

40:00.773 --> 40:01.899
I just--

40:01.982 --> 40:02.983
I can't.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.152
Okay.

40:05.820 --> 40:06.737
I just...

40:08.239 --> 40:10.324
I guess I get into trouble
when I move too fast.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.410
I'm impulsive...

40:13.536 --> 40:14.537
Um...

40:15.204 --> 40:17.081
I just need to think about my girls.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.583
About Serena.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.254
Kat said something the other--
Just not tonight.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.631
Okay, yeah. No, it's fine. We can be--

40:26.340 --> 40:27.675
We can move slowly,

40:27.758 --> 40:29.301
-all right?
-Thank you.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.556
I had a really great time with you today.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.141
[laughs] Me too.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.060
Okay.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.688
See you tomorrow?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.200
[door opens]

40:58.080 --> 40:59.290
Thanks for coming.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.376
Why am I here?

41:05.296 --> 41:06.505
Because you were right.

41:08.549 --> 41:09.508
Sort of.

41:23.731 --> 41:24.690
Last year,

41:25.357 --> 41:26.484
when we, uh...

41:29.612 --> 41:31.447
I called you the next day, and I...

41:32.448 --> 41:33.657
I never do that.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.660
So when you didn't call me back,

41:37.203 --> 41:38.245
I...

41:39.622 --> 41:40.706
I was hurt.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.710
Not my-- Not my pride, just...

41:46.545 --> 41:48.714
I don't know.
I thought we had a connection.

41:52.551 --> 41:54.386
I guess I was wrong, but...

41:55.638 --> 41:57.681
that's on me, not you.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.978
If that's making it harder for you
to skate with me now,

42:03.854 --> 42:04.855
I get it.

42:08.442 --> 42:09.610
You should know...

42:12.863 --> 42:15.658
I wasn't really in a great place
back then.

42:20.287 --> 42:22.831
If I made things any worse for you,
I'm sorry.

42:30.422 --> 42:31.799
What I said earlier...

42:34.843 --> 42:35.886
I'm sorry too.

42:41.433 --> 42:43.477
We couldn't have done this inside?

42:43.561 --> 42:45.646
-It's fucking freezing!
-[laughing]

42:48.857 --> 42:50.276
I wanna show you something.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.591
My mom used to take me here
when I was a kid.

43:14.049 --> 43:15.259
[laughs]

43:15.342 --> 43:17.928
I've never actually been out here
with anybody else, but...

43:18.012 --> 43:20.180
I thought maybe we could just skate.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.226
[laughs] I don't know.
It's probably dumb, but...

43:25.477 --> 43:27.313
at least your mom's not here.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.440
Wanna try it again?
