40:41.339 --> 40:43.306
      We keep putting crab
          on like this,

40:43.308 --> 40:44.774
       the end is going to
         sneak up on us.

40:44.776 --> 40:50.380
   Before we know it, we'll be
   putting the happy stack on.

40:50.382 --> 40:54.117
  Jake: I have to get back out
  and fish as soon as possible.

40:54.119 --> 40:57.921
         This is a race,
  and it's a race against time.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.657
      Time is not something
          that I have.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.025
        Man: Oh, my god!

41:02.027 --> 41:03.593
            Narrator:
    The clock winding down...

41:03.595 --> 41:05.995
     The fishing has dropped
          dramatically.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.565
    Narrator: ...And the crab
    more scarce by the hour.

41:08.567 --> 41:12.168
 It's the beginning of the end.

41:12.170 --> 41:16.239
 We'll see how much mental pride
       and drive they got.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.508
            Narrator:
   Still to come this season,

41:18.510 --> 41:20.710
    the last desperate charge

41:20.712 --> 41:25.014
     to grab what's left of
 the $110 million opilio bounty.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.717
           Last trip.
         Here we go. Ha!

41:27.719 --> 41:29.853
    Man: We're going fishing.
         [ horn blares ]

41:29.855 --> 41:31.654
             holy...

41:36.061 --> 41:37.927
             -Whoa!
       -That must be bad.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.829
       Something bad must
         have happened.

41:39.831 --> 41:43.700
     Man: <i> Make sure he's not</i>
     <i> starting to bleed out.</i>

41:43.702 --> 41:45.134
              Jake:
     Bring that [bleep] up.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.003
Does the crew have enough juice?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.873
     You've got to want it,
       give up everything.

41:49.875 --> 41:52.075
You've got to struggle and fight
       to get to the top.
