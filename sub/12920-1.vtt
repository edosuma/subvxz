Mr. Harris.

Hi, hi, it's Ian from
J&J Brokerage firm.

01:47.207 --> 01:49.952
Yeah, yeah, how you doing?

Oh, me? I'm great, man.
I can't complain, man.

01:53.413 --> 01:57.159
So, um, we're just here
looking at the numbers.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.295
Did you see 'em?

01:59.319 --> 02:01.964
Uh-uh, you see? I told
you they would go up.

02:01.988 --> 02:04.133
I know, I know it was
your wife's call.

02:04.157 --> 02:08.002
That's okay, but look how
much that call cost you.

you I had another one?

You know I'm trying to
make all that money.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.488
Right.

03:11.824 --> 03:13.202
Yeah, nah.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.539
Not busy.

Okay, okay, cool.
Yeah, let's do that.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.288
Hey, Tony.

Uh, the new kid, Ian?
He's doing very well.

03:36.816 --> 03:40.629
Yeah, I was thinking
the same thing.

03:40.653 --> 03:45.692
Hey, you know, it's been a long
time since we had a promotion.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.240
Yeah, it's been kind of a tough
year for these candidates, man.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.075
Now as you know, there's a
lot of money to be made,

03:53.099 --> 03:54.810
so we need to make it.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.246
We need to put it
in my hands, okay?

03:57.270 --> 03:58.914
So what do you think, you
wanna take him to Nick?

03:58.938 --> 04:01.016
That's exactly what
I want you to do.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.843
I thought you said
he's an ass kisser.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.090
He's a moneymaker.

04:08.114 --> 04:11.493
He can kiss ass all he wants.
Kiss your ass if he wants to.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.996
As long as he's putting money
in my hands, you feel me?

04:14.020 --> 04:15.297
Are you sure?

04:15.321 --> 04:19.435
Goddammit, Tony, is
that what I said?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.536
You're always questioning me.

You will never be me,
do you understand?

04:26.132 --> 04:28.611
'Cause I don't kiss ass.

I will fuck you up.

his motherfucking mind.

- Hey, Ian.
- What's up?

05:00.166 --> 05:02.678
- Tony wants to see you.
- Did he say what about?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.346
No.

Harris account earlier,

05:06.673 --> 05:09.051

05:09.075 --> 05:11.887
Might want me to make partner

05:11.911 --> 05:13.656
Yeah, we gotta get going.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.491
- Oh, right this moment?
- Right now.

Listen, the higher-ups
wanna see you.

I'm bored.

06:01.461 --> 06:05.374
I'm going on a retreat with some
of my associates very soon.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.242
I'm gonna take you with me.
I meant to tell you that.

06:07.266 --> 06:09.278
Really? So we're really gonna
go somewhere this time?

06:09.302 --> 06:10.779
Really, yeah.

You're not afraid of
anybody seeing us?

06:12.672 --> 06:15.117
I'm not worried about anything.
You're with me now, okay?

06:15.141 --> 06:18.220
Hmm. Well, you know,
this is your business,

06:18.244 --> 06:22.291
and... all these
people work for you.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.993
That was before.
You're with me now.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.795
It's cool now, all right?

06:26.819 --> 06:29.589
Great. So I need to go shopping.

06:31.290 --> 06:34.193
Let me get some money here.
Here, is that enough?

06:35.495 --> 06:37.597
This will do just fine.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.945
So how am I gonna
get to the mall?

06:42.969 --> 06:44.947
I'll get you a car.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.982
I can drive myself.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.817
You wanna drive, really?

06:48.841 --> 06:50.619
- I do.
- Uh-huh.

06:50.643 --> 06:53.021
I need you alive, okay? I'm
gonna get you a car, okay?

06:53.045 --> 06:54.523
Oh, that's for the car?

06:54.547 --> 06:57.126
Wow.

06:57.150 --> 07:01.096
Here. That's a couple cars.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.166
Or you could maybe take the
bus and buy two outfits.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.191
I'm kidding.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.346
- Huh?
- Ain't got any other choice.

07:17.370 --> 07:21.049
- You like him? You like him?
- Yeah.

07:21.073 --> 07:25.120
Ian, we've been watching you,

07:25.144 --> 07:28.991
and, um, you've been
doing some good work.

07:29.015 --> 07:32.361
Amazing work, actually.
Wouldn't you say?

07:32.385 --> 07:34.329
Yeah, we've been very impressed.

07:34.353 --> 07:37.065
Thank you, sir. That
means a lot to me.

07:37.089 --> 07:40.969
Um, the fellas and I have been
working here in this firm

07:40.993 --> 07:45.040
together for, oh,
just some time now.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.475
To start a successful business,

07:46.499 --> 07:48.644
a very successful business,

07:48.668 --> 07:50.412
you need many things.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.748
There's intangibles, et cetera.

07:52.772 --> 07:57.486
But every enterprise,
big enterprise,

07:57.510 --> 08:00.889
has one thing in common,
one common denominator,

08:00.913 --> 08:03.950
and that is teamwork.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.930
What do you think, Ian,
would you agree with that?

08:07.954 --> 08:09.898
Yes, of course. Yes, sir.

08:09.922 --> 08:12.401
I agree with everything
you just said, 100%.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.069
As a matter of fact,

08:14.093 --> 08:17.539
I agree with everything
you said, 110%.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.508
You can't do anything 110%.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.543
You can only do 100%.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.413
And I want your best 100%, okay?

08:24.437 --> 08:26.715
So where was I?
Company, teamwork, um,

08:26.739 --> 08:27.916
how do you make a lot of money.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.418
I was talking about money,

08:29.442 --> 08:30.519
I'm always talking
about money, actually.

08:30.543 --> 08:31.920
Money or pussy.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.522
So how do you make
a lot of money?

08:33.546 --> 08:36.592
How do we make a lot of
money, more to the point.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.193
How do we make a lot of money?

08:38.217 --> 08:40.729
Company picnics, right?

08:40.753 --> 08:41.897
Did he say that?

08:41.921 --> 08:43.398
That's nice shit, Ian.

08:43.422 --> 08:44.733
- What did he say?
- He said picnics.

08:44.757 --> 08:46.702
- He talking about black people?
- Yeah.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.771
- He's black.
- Ian, come on.

08:49.795 --> 08:53.041
But picnics? Hang
on a second, Ian.

08:53.065 --> 08:57.980
Did you say picnics, really?
Fuck you, you did not.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.782
We take the gloves off in here.
This is how we are upstairs.

09:00.806 --> 09:03.118
Okay, you assholes
downstairs gotta work.

09:03.142 --> 09:06.088
We're up here kicking
it and counting money.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.325
We take the gloves
off up here, baby.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.495
Where are all the bitches? Oh,
I'm just joking. Anyway...

09:13.519 --> 09:16.064
what do you think these persons
are doing Friday night?

09:16.088 --> 09:18.433
I'll tell you. Bonding!

09:18.457 --> 09:19.935
Bonding. I was
gonna say bonding.

09:19.959 --> 09:22.971
Teamwork! How do
you become a team?

09:22.995 --> 09:24.773
You bond.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.575
You see all these great
teams in the 80's,

09:26.599 --> 09:28.744
the 70's, 70's.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.612
Teamwork!

09:30.636 --> 09:33.315
Lew Alcindor, then
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

09:33.339 --> 09:34.983
Bill Walton, Greg Lee,

09:35.007 --> 09:37.753
Marques Johnson, Walt
Hazzard, Gail Goodrich.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.022
John Wooden was the key.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.958
He made them play as a team!

09:42.982 --> 09:45.928
The Bulls! They had Michael.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.196
You gotta have a go-to guy
to win a championship,

09:48.220 --> 09:50.332
but they were a team!

09:50.356 --> 09:53.702
Steve Kerr won a championship,
so did Jim Paxson.

09:53.726 --> 09:55.604
The team.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.539
Michael Jordan doesn't win
anything without a team.

09:57.563 --> 09:59.975
Mike wasn't shit until
Scottie Pippen.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.645
Scottie? Shut up. I
said that already.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.881
Everybody's integral
to the teammates.

10:05.905 --> 10:08.350
You're right, Nick.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.485
I see what you're doing.
Okay, man, go ahead.

10:10.509 --> 10:13.488
We're gonna pause now.
We're gonna pause now.

10:13.512 --> 10:15.848
- You wanna pause?
- Yeah.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.664
One of our partners here
thinks you're a bit nervous.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.232
Do you feel a bit nervous?

10:24.256 --> 10:25.634
No, sir, not at all.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.569
It's okay. Listen, honesty is...

10:27.593 --> 10:29.371
Real men aren't
afraid of the truth.

10:29.395 --> 10:33.008
No, no, I'm... Hit a
deer before, you know.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.677
I just ran him smooth over.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.746
No. Nervous in this interview.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.149
No, no, not at all. Not at
all, not nervous at all.

10:41.173 --> 10:43.018
I'm not sure if you're
nervous or an ass kisser

10:43.042 --> 10:44.486
or a nervous ass kisser.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.926
But one thing I do know is
you're willing to learn.

10:50.950 --> 10:56.098
If you want to play hard and learn...
and listen,

10:56.122 --> 10:58.867
you can get better,
you can improve.

10:58.891 --> 11:00.902
We're not the NBA.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.505
You gotta be great. You
got to have gifts.

11:03.529 --> 11:07.209
In business, you can learn.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.769
We fuck people up.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.849
We want our competitors
to go home and cry.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.217
We want to destroy their will,

11:15.241 --> 11:17.252
go home and not feel
like you're big.

11:17.276 --> 11:21.390
I just lost $200 million.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.925
That would fuck me up.

11:23.949 --> 11:26.928
Bottom line, Ian,

11:26.952 --> 11:29.197
are you in?

11:29.221 --> 11:31.199
Me? You guys want to invite me?

11:31.223 --> 11:33.035
- It's the next phase.
- Yes, of course!

11:33.059 --> 11:34.436
Well, then come down here
and shake our hands.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.329
Yeah! Thank you, guys.
I appreciate it.

11:39.398 --> 11:40.709
You know, I'd stand up,

11:40.733 --> 11:43.078
but I'm kind of ashamed
I have on jeans.

11:43.102 --> 11:46.448
I did this interview with you...
Oh, whatever. I'll get up.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.383
Hey, you do whatever
you want, sir.

11:48.407 --> 11:49.675
- Come here.
- Thank you.

I know you're not
about to call him.

12:33.018 --> 12:36.298
No, I'm not, relax.

12:36.322 --> 12:39.101
But you know what he did.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.862
I know. I'm over it, okay? I'm
not gonna call, I promise.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.417
It's freezing!

14:02.441 --> 14:04.443
Jules, I'm over it.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.547
Jules?

14:10.950 --> 14:14.129
Jules? Oh, my God.

14:14.153 --> 14:16.565
Jules!

14:16.589 --> 14:18.157
Jules!

14:26.799 --> 14:27.900
Ready?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.103
Uh, yeah.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.274
Yeah, let's do it.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.557
When I got back from
the tech convention,

14:42.581 --> 14:44.559
she wasn't at the
airport to pick me up.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.394
Her friends didn't
know where she was at

14:46.418 --> 14:47.896
and neither did her parents.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.998
That's when we filed the report.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.834
Can you provide any
contact information

14:52.858 --> 14:54.569
on the friends you
traveled with?

14:54.593 --> 14:56.771
Sure, if you think
that's gonna help.

14:56.795 --> 14:57.997
Just covering the bases.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.010
If there's anything
else I can do to help,

15:02.034 --> 15:04.913
please just let me
know, and I'll do it.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.449
I just want her home safe.
I miss her.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.251
You're doing fine.

15:09.275 --> 15:11.253
Just keep passing out flyers and
getting out the information.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.255
That's the best
way you can help.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.358
All right, uh, just
one more question.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.961
The night you left, what
was your fight about?

15:19.985 --> 15:21.096
Fight?

15:21.120 --> 15:23.665
Yeah. One of her friends, um...

15:23.689 --> 15:25.500
- Stephanie Miller.
- Yeah.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.535
Said they went out to dinner
because you guys had a fight.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.770
What was that about?

15:28.794 --> 15:31.039
No, it was a stupid fight.

15:31.063 --> 15:34.342
She was upset that I went
to the tech convention.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.479
She wanted to go to a
concert to see some band.

15:37.503 --> 15:40.515
I went to the convention
for work, not for fun.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.350
Her argument had
no malice in it.

15:42.374 --> 15:45.720
It was just a stupid fight.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.789
Oh, shit.

15:47.813 --> 15:49.882
- Your mom again?
- Yeah.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.018
See you in the car.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.131
Hey, Mom.

15:56.155 --> 15:57.532
Hey, baby, how you doing?

15:57.556 --> 15:59.467
I'm good, Mom. I'm just working.

15:59.491 --> 16:03.672
Good. Tell me, have you found
those missing people yet?

16:03.696 --> 16:06.641
Uh, no, Mom, but we will.
Don't worry.

16:06.665 --> 16:09.411
That's good. I'm not worried.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.413
Have you talked to
your brother lately?

16:11.437 --> 16:15.850
Uh, no, Mom, but...
but I will, Mom.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.719
Call your brother.

16:17.743 --> 16:22.857
I don't want you two to be
distant and not know each other.

16:22.881 --> 16:25.860
I just don't understand how
people can be that way,

16:25.884 --> 16:27.429
treat family like that.

16:27.453 --> 16:30.999
Okay, Mom. I gotta go, Mom.
I'm working.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.359
I love you.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.277
All right, man.

16:42.301 --> 16:44.179
We're just gonna chill,

16:44.203 --> 16:46.181
but make sure you listen to
everything they say, all right?

16:46.205 --> 16:47.749
All right, all right, man.

16:47.773 --> 16:48.883
This is Nick's house right here?

16:48.907 --> 16:50.418
Yeah, man, check it out.

16:50.442 --> 16:54.089
Ooh! Man, this is nice!
Look at this boat!

16:54.113 --> 16:55.757
I even called some
broads for you,

16:55.781 --> 16:56.858
I know you like
black girls, right?

16:56.882 --> 16:58.426
- Hell yeah.
- I do too.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.563
- Hell yeah, man.
- Get something up in here.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.098
Ooh, shit.

17:03.122 --> 17:05.900
Hey, don't be kissing
no ass though.

17:05.924 --> 17:07.102
No ass. No ass kissing.

17:07.126 --> 17:08.636
All right, here we go.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.061
No ass kissing.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.545
- Dope spot, right?
- Hey, is this...

17:17.569 --> 17:19.280
Hey, Tony, man, be
honest with me.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.647
That wasn't too much
at the office, right?

17:20.672 --> 17:22.317
I don't want to
disrespect nobody...

17:22.340 --> 17:24.919
Dude, chill, chill!

17:24.943 --> 17:26.654
- Chill, bro, chill.
- Okay, okay, yeah.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.123
I'll chill, I'm good.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.624
Don't worry, man.
I got you, man.

17:29.648 --> 17:31.893
I want you to fit in.
Just have a good time.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.495
We're gonna get drunk.
We're gonna smoke.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.996
I got some bitches lined up.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.164
- Got some bitches lined up?
- Hell yeah.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.632
I know you like bitches, right?

17:37.656 --> 17:40.001
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
What kind of bitches?

17:40.025 --> 17:42.504
You're not gay? Fuck no.
Stop that, dude.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.805
Come on, I like bitches, man.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.607
- All right.
- What kinda bitches?

17:45.631 --> 17:47.275
I mean, you know,
myself, I like titties.

17:47.299 --> 17:48.676
Big-ass chocolate
titties, man, I swear.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.445
Titties like I just
turn my face up...

17:50.469 --> 17:52.447
Yeah, man, just don't
be kissing any ass.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.339
- All right, man.
- Come on.

17:56.809 --> 18:00.188
This is cool, you know?

18:00.212 --> 18:02.190
Just chill and have a good time.
Relax.

18:02.214 --> 18:06.761
Roland, so when are you going to
teach me how to shoot your gun?

18:06.785 --> 18:09.464
- Teach you how to shoot?
- Yeah!

18:09.488 --> 18:11.866
How about I plan a trip and
teach you ladies how to shoot?

18:11.890 --> 18:14.335
- How about that?
- Yeah!

18:14.359 --> 18:16.337
Well, if you're not going
to teach me how to shoot,

18:16.361 --> 18:18.139
I think we all get
to take shots.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.875
Shots! Bring me one!

18:20.899 --> 18:23.635
- You drinking with this?
- Yeah!

18:25.370 --> 18:28.516
Hey, Tony, where's Nick?

18:28.540 --> 18:30.952
Nick who? He passed out
like 10 minutes ago.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.520
I'm gonna need like ten shots.

18:32.544 --> 18:34.189
I felt like that.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.957
Yeah, thank you.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.892
I need you to pass me
out, can you do that?

18:37.916 --> 18:39.828
- I guess.
- You guess? Drink that.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.296
- All right.
- Drink that, get it!

18:41.320 --> 18:42.554
Yeah!

18:44.923 --> 18:47.168
Hey, I gotta be honest
with you fellas,

18:47.192 --> 18:50.672
I've never, ever experienced
anything like this before.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.141
Oh, what's the matter?

18:53.165 --> 18:55.176
Your girlfriend don't
let you party?

18:55.200 --> 18:57.312
Hey, tonight he doesn't
have a girlfriend.

18:57.336 --> 18:59.180
Well, you're his girlfriend, so
you could be his girlfriend,

18:59.204 --> 19:02.250
- I'll just go buy a new one.
- Wait a minute now.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.219
I just brought my girls
here to have a good time.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.378
We just trying to party.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.257
So...

19:09.281 --> 19:11.392
since I'm your girlfriend now,

19:11.416 --> 19:13.728
I'm gonna insist that
you have a good time,

19:13.752 --> 19:16.998
so go ahead and drink this shot.

19:17.022 --> 19:19.167
Man up.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.402
Shit, I guess you only
live once, right?

19:21.426 --> 19:23.705
That's right.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.650
You been so good, I didn't
have to tie you up.

20:25.857 --> 20:27.259
Where am I?

20:36.435 --> 20:39.847
Help! Somebody help me!

20:49.815 --> 20:51.450
Oh, no!

20:53.018 --> 20:54.195
Where am I?

20:54.219 --> 20:57.465
Help! Help!

20:57.489 --> 20:59.601
Somebody help me!

21:04.896 --> 21:06.507
No!

21:06.531 --> 21:07.966
Where am I?

21:11.169 --> 21:13.071
Hey, over here!

21:14.740 --> 21:16.784
Oh, God.

21:16.808 --> 21:17.809
Okay.

21:25.984 --> 21:28.863
Fuck is this?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.268
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.717
- How many points is that?
- 300.

21:49.741 --> 21:51.719
All right, let me get closer.

21:51.743 --> 21:53.721
Hey, how's the fresh
blood back there, huh?

21:53.745 --> 21:57.091
- He's taking it like a champ.
- Yeah?

21:57.115 --> 22:00.028
This the white fucking rabbit!
This is 800 points!

22:00.052 --> 22:01.429
Damn. He can win with just that.

22:01.453 --> 22:04.032
Ian, this is your
big moment, baby!

22:04.056 --> 22:06.067
You could win the Super
Bowl right now, baby!

22:06.091 --> 22:08.403
- What's it gonna be?
- No, no.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.339
- Get the fuck out the buggy.
- No, no, no, I can't.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.108
- I can't.
- Look at my face!

22:14.132 --> 22:17.345
Get your ass out the buggy!

22:21.406 --> 22:23.685
Ian. Ian!

22:23.709 --> 22:25.887
Motherfucker!

22:25.911 --> 22:27.889
Now, you told me you'd
be okay with this shit!

22:27.913 --> 22:29.857
You ain't a liar, are you?

22:29.881 --> 22:31.626
You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

22:31.650 --> 22:33.528
- No, I'm not a murderer!
- I don't give a fuck.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.964
I asked if you were a liar.
You're not a liar, are you?

22:36.988 --> 22:41.235
I can't do this! This is sick!
This is crazy!

22:41.259 --> 22:43.938
Okay, listen to me.

22:43.962 --> 22:47.041
This is how it's gonna be.

22:47.065 --> 22:51.045
This is what's going on! Okay.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.780
Shut your ass up!

22:52.804 --> 22:55.550
Roland, don't kill her yet.

22:55.574 --> 22:58.419
It's either you or it's her.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.755
It's either her or it's you.

23:00.779 --> 23:02.957
What's it gonna be?

23:02.981 --> 23:05.059
I ain't gonna give you
this gun, brother.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.762
You need to take it from me.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.664
It's either you or it's her.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.733
You gotta make a
choice right now!

23:11.757 --> 23:15.636
Oh, no, no, please, no, no.

23:15.660 --> 23:18.339
Don't be fucking stupid, Ian.

23:18.363 --> 23:19.841
Don't point that gun at me.

23:19.865 --> 23:21.409
Roland will shoot you in
the back of the head.

23:21.433 --> 23:26.581
Please, please, no!

23:26.605 --> 23:28.316
Shoot her!

23:28.340 --> 23:30.918
Please don't.

23:30.942 --> 23:33.154
Come on, man! You're
making me look bad!

23:33.178 --> 23:34.655
No, please! Don't hurt me!

23:34.679 --> 23:37.358
600 points right there. 600.
Shoot that bitch.

23:37.382 --> 23:38.459
No!

23:42.187 --> 23:45.933
That's what I'm talking about!
Get your ass back in the buggy!

23:48.360 --> 23:50.671
That-a-boy!

23:50.695 --> 23:53.040
You did it.

23:53.064 --> 23:55.343
How you feeling?

23:55.367 --> 23:58.279
I liked it.

23:58.303 --> 23:59.614
He liked it!

23:59.638 --> 24:01.382
What you thinking? Come on!

24:01.406 --> 24:04.819
- Gotta move on, motherfucker!
- Get your ass in the buggy!

24:04.843 --> 24:06.687
We're rolling out
motherfuckers, go!

24:06.711 --> 24:08.556
Go! Let's go!

24:08.580 --> 24:10.291
Fuck these motherfuckers!

24:10.315 --> 24:12.017
Let's just go!

24:15.821 --> 24:18.089
Let's go, Daddy!

24:29.501 --> 24:30.645
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:30.669 --> 24:31.913
- Morning.
- Good morning.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.648
What are you doing
up this early?

24:33.672 --> 24:36.083
Cat was being a butthead, and
he kicked me out of bed.

24:36.107 --> 24:37.485
Why didn't you just
toss him off the bed?

24:37.509 --> 24:40.388
I did. Three times.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.391
All right, all right. I
should head out to work.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.050
Come here.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.399
What time are you coming home?

24:51.423 --> 24:53.000
I'll come home
early, bring dinner.

24:53.024 --> 24:55.670
- Pizza!
- Okay, okay.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.338
- I love you.
- I love you.

24:57.362 --> 24:59.240
Try not to get into a
fistfight with him.

24:59.264 --> 25:01.066
No promises.

25:05.537 --> 25:07.682
Hey, I found a pattern between
the three missing people

25:07.706 --> 25:09.250
in the last two years.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.853
It's a small one, but
it could be something.

25:11.877 --> 25:13.754
They all played penny
stocks over at J&J.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.623
Do you want me to call over,
see if they know anything?

25:15.647 --> 25:17.816
No, I got it.

25:23.088 --> 25:27.702
J&J Financial. This is Ian.
How may I help you?

25:27.726 --> 25:29.270
Hey.

25:29.294 --> 25:32.773
Yeah, listen, um, something
came up from work,

25:32.797 --> 25:35.643
and I was wondering if you could
check out some names for me.

25:35.667 --> 25:39.780
I'm not really sure
if I'm supposed to.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.782
What's this about?

25:41.806 --> 25:46.153
Yeah, we found a connection
between a missing,

25:46.177 --> 25:49.156
and we just want to see if
there's any more information.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.892
All right, go ahead and
give me the names.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.461
Oh, yeah we got a...

25:53.485 --> 25:56.297
Debra Fields, Anthony Jefferies

25:56.321 --> 25:57.632
and Julie...

25:57.656 --> 25:59.767
- McBRIDE: Garin.
- Garin.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.303
Okay. All right. I have
them all written down.

26:02.327 --> 26:05.406
I'll go ahead and pass
these to my higher-ups.

26:05.430 --> 26:07.108
Okay, thanks.

26:07.132 --> 26:10.077
Yeah, it's the best I can
do without breaking the law

26:10.101 --> 26:12.947
or without a warrant
or anything.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.815
Listen, I really
want to help, I do,

26:14.839 --> 26:17.318
but I just don't want
to get in trouble.

26:17.342 --> 26:20.521
Um, have you talked
to Mom lately?

26:20.545 --> 26:24.258
Kinda really busy right now.

26:24.282 --> 26:27.028
You know, clients and all.
You understand right?

26:27.052 --> 26:30.598
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Me too, me too.

26:30.622 --> 26:32.524
Yeah, take it easy.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.659
We gotta go.

26:40.966 --> 26:42.176
Shit.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.512
Ballsy motherfucker, huh?

26:44.536 --> 26:46.113
Look, he doesn't have
a warrant, okay?

26:46.137 --> 26:47.715
And he really will never,
ever talk to me again

26:47.739 --> 26:50.017
and go forward with this.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.687
Look, if he does call
back, just let me know.

26:52.711 --> 26:54.188
I mean, they're all
small-time losers

26:54.212 --> 26:56.123
paid by money order or whatnot.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.059
So there's no trail. Don't
even worry about it.

26:58.083 --> 27:01.128
- So we're good?
- Yeah. Beautiful.

27:01.152 --> 27:03.054
It's all good, man.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.302
Eddie!

27:08.326 --> 27:09.637
Hey, Matteo.

27:09.661 --> 27:12.206
Steady Eddie.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.708
- Man!
- Come here.

27:13.732 --> 27:14.976
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.078
That was... Whew!

27:17.102 --> 27:19.013
You...

27:19.037 --> 27:20.982
- We got lucky.
- Hey, I don't know, man.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.650
That was all you right there.

27:22.674 --> 27:24.085
I was just doing my job.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.320
- It was.
- We got lucky. We got lucky.

27:26.344 --> 27:29.090
Nah, bro, that's all you right there.
That's all you!

27:29.114 --> 27:30.749
You're welcome. You're welcome.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.761
We got lucky.

27:33.785 --> 27:37.031
We can't expect that
kind of turnaround.

27:37.055 --> 27:40.735
But we got it, so we're
going to use it.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.738
We're gonna go long term, and
we're gonna put some money

27:43.762 --> 27:46.273
right back into your
pocket, all right?

27:46.297 --> 27:48.576
And then I'm gonna take the bulk
of it, I'm gonna reinvest it.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.946
Listen, we made a lot
of money last time.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.581
All right? A lot.

27:53.605 --> 27:57.118
So whatever it is you
want me to do, I'm in.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.186
Just tell me what you need
me to do, and we're in.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.688
This is what I needed from you.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.256
I needed the face-to-face.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.526
Now I go back in, and I
take care of all of it.

28:05.550 --> 28:08.262
I just needed the okay from you.

28:08.286 --> 28:10.765
So, hate to cut it short,
but daddy-duty calls.

28:10.789 --> 28:11.932
Before I go, you want
anything to eat?

28:11.956 --> 28:13.134
- Coffee?
- I'm good.

28:13.158 --> 28:14.235
- You sure?
- I already drank.

28:14.259 --> 28:15.569
- You sure?
- Yeah.

28:15.593 --> 28:17.238
All right, my man.
Thank you so much.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.440
- You're welcome.
- I'll see you next time.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.742
- Say hi! Say hi.
- Hi.

28:21.766 --> 28:24.412
- Hey.
- See you later.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.472
That's Daddy's friend right there.
Best friend.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.976
I'll do my best.
I'll do my best.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.626
It happened last night.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.585
He's with the sketch
artist right now.

28:46.991 --> 28:48.469
I'm Special Agent Collins,

28:48.493 --> 28:49.804
and this is Special
Agent McBride.

28:49.828 --> 28:51.505
We're with the FBI,
Missing Persons.

28:51.529 --> 28:53.998
We'd like to talk to you
about what happened.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.168
- Now?
- Just about done.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.750
That's him! That's the
motherfucker that jumped me!

29:02.774 --> 29:04.318
He jumped me from behind!

29:04.342 --> 29:06.654
Okay, Mr. Monroe, you
wanna start from the top,

29:06.678 --> 29:08.923
tell me what happened?

29:08.947 --> 29:10.758
Well, I was leaving work.

29:10.782 --> 29:16.688
♪♪

29:19.124 --> 29:21.135
And then I lit me a cigarette.

29:21.159 --> 29:23.838
I started my car first,
and I lit a cigarette.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.953
And I heard a noise over
by the garbage cans,

29:38.977 --> 29:42.380
and I walked over to
see what was going on.

29:51.689 --> 29:53.667
But I didn't see anything.

29:53.691 --> 29:56.594
So as I turned around, he
jumped me from behind!

30:09.073 --> 30:10.818
I got a copyright
match on the tattoos.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.653
It's an artist from
Fuentes County.

30:12.677 --> 30:14.488
I want you to get in touch with
the local sheriff's department,

30:14.512 --> 30:15.890
let them know we're on our way.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.758
What is it, a six-hour drive?

30:17.782 --> 30:19.584
Four and a half.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.496
You did good, Mr. Monroe.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.732
This is a big break
in our investigation.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.934
You did real good, man.
Real good.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.893
Can I go home to my family now?

30:32.797 --> 30:34.775
No, no, I believe
in this company.

30:34.799 --> 30:37.278
Listen, the market's clear.

30:37.302 --> 30:40.247
Their patents are in. It's good.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.683
I'm bringing this only
to my best customers.

30:42.707 --> 30:45.419
You're number three for the day.

30:45.443 --> 30:48.589
We can start out
small if you want.

30:48.613 --> 30:52.459
Okay, okay. Now I'll
send it over to you.

30:52.483 --> 30:55.229
Yeah. I don't know.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.933
This is gonna be great.
All right, thank you.

30:58.957 --> 31:01.202
All right, bye, Bob.

31:01.226 --> 31:04.972
Ed, my man. Look at you, man.
I don't know how you do it.

31:04.996 --> 31:06.807
I just sell it to
'em straight, man.

31:06.831 --> 31:08.943
You know, that's funny
because usually our business

31:08.967 --> 31:11.745
runs on bullshitting
as much as possible.

31:11.769 --> 31:14.081
I don't know what to say. I
guess I got the magic touch.

31:14.105 --> 31:16.050
Yeah, that's good, man.
Hey, you keep it up, okay?

31:16.074 --> 31:17.618
You're doing a great job, Ed.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.987
Hey, um, listen, so, um...

31:20.011 --> 31:22.590
I'm about to go talk to
the big boys upstairs.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.959
Usually we go on
these vacations.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.727
Hunting trips, you know,

31:26.751 --> 31:29.897
and I want to see if you're
okay with going with us.

31:29.921 --> 31:32.166
I mean, I'm not really
much of a hunter.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.134
Hey, hey, bro, look,
I understand, okay?

31:34.158 --> 31:37.137
Neither was I. I mean,
look at me, right?

31:37.161 --> 31:38.939
But there's really not
much to it, you know?

31:38.963 --> 31:40.941
But I'm telling you, man,

31:40.965 --> 31:43.110
if you get in good with
these guys on that level,

31:43.134 --> 31:45.312
it'll do wonders
for your career.

31:45.336 --> 31:47.615
I'm talking about
major money, okay?

31:47.639 --> 31:49.750
All right, man, so
how's that sound?

31:49.774 --> 31:52.753
I'll run it by my wife and
get back to you after lunch?

31:52.777 --> 31:55.189
Talk to the wife? Hey,
man, talk to the wife.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.625
Let me know. I'll go
upstairs and talk to them.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.026
- Okay.
- All right, man.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.294
I'll put in a good word for you.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.220
- Thank you.
- Keep up the good work.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.958
Look, I understand.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.729
I don't care about his kids.

32:13.197 --> 32:14.499
Fire him.

32:16.968 --> 32:18.002
Okay.

32:20.638 --> 32:22.740
What do you think
of that new guy?

32:25.476 --> 32:29.456
Nice guy, smart.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.493
I think he could make
us a lot of money.

32:32.517 --> 32:35.462
Well, any of these guys could
make us a lot of money.

32:35.486 --> 32:37.698
What makes him different?

32:37.722 --> 32:40.668
Well, I can see it in his eyes.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.537
Kinda like you.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.697
How so?

32:48.666 --> 32:52.212
Sometimes you just know.

32:52.236 --> 32:54.238
Good job with this.

32:56.441 --> 32:59.219
What makes him like me?

32:59.243 --> 33:01.322
He's ambitious.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.924
He's smart.

33:03.948 --> 33:06.617
And that's the killer inside.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.997
Well, where is he now?

33:10.021 --> 33:13.834
As a matter of fact,
he's with Ian right now.

33:13.858 --> 33:15.860
So catch up with him.

33:18.563 --> 33:20.207
You can go.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.966
All right.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.300
William, where you at?
I got groceries.

33:46.324 --> 33:49.937
Edward! Look at you.
How you doing, pal?

33:49.961 --> 33:51.638
I'm good. How about yourself?

33:51.662 --> 33:54.041
Oh, I'm strong as an ox. Do
not let the limp fool you.

33:54.065 --> 33:55.409
I believe it.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.078
You can set those down.

33:58.102 --> 33:59.713
How's Kelly doing?

33:59.737 --> 34:02.249
She's doing good. You
know, the new place,

34:02.273 --> 34:03.884
getting territorial
with the cats.

34:03.908 --> 34:06.253
Sounds about right.

34:06.277 --> 34:09.822
Hey, listen, I appreciate you
not telling her about this.

34:09.847 --> 34:13.226
It's all right, it really is.

34:13.251 --> 34:15.262
It's good.

34:15.286 --> 34:20.134
Oh, Ed, I just...

34:20.158 --> 34:23.137
I'm really sorry. I
wish I wasn't hurt.

34:23.161 --> 34:26.273
I've worked for 40
years, and here I am.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.574
This is how they treat me.

34:28.599 --> 34:31.411
My own son-in-law, you
know, sneaking me money.

34:31.436 --> 34:34.581
I don't deserve this. I
don't deserve you, Ed.

34:34.605 --> 34:37.083
It's okay, it really is.
You're family.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.010
Aw, dude, give me a hug.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.681
Good cat. Let get these here.

34:48.119 --> 34:50.797
Hey, Amagashi, I got your
stuff right over here.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.956
Yeah, I got it right here.
All your bodies, man.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.203
What do you guys need
so many bodies for?

34:56.226 --> 34:59.173
I do not talk to you, okay?

34:59.197 --> 35:01.642
Listen, listen to me.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.777
You stop right now, okay?

35:03.801 --> 35:07.214
- I don't talk to the helper.
- Helper?

35:07.238 --> 35:09.383
Answer my question: How many
American bodies do you have?

35:09.407 --> 35:11.351
Hey, I'm the one that
gets you these bodies.

35:11.375 --> 35:13.287
As many as you want, I got 'em.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.055
Male, female.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.057
I know what you like
with those females too.

35:17.081 --> 35:19.726
Are they all in
this hole-y shape?

35:19.750 --> 35:21.395
They're in great shape.

35:21.419 --> 35:23.497
So unprofessional.

35:23.521 --> 35:27.701
You put it in the trash bag,
put it in the cold. Please.

35:27.725 --> 35:29.303
It's in here, it's quick.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.539
All the other ones are
nice, nice wrapped tight.

35:32.563 --> 35:34.074
Right now I need numbers.

35:34.098 --> 35:36.210
How many American
bodies can you buy?

35:36.234 --> 35:37.911
50, 75, 100. I don't buy them.

35:37.935 --> 35:39.680
I get 'em for you. I'll
get you all of them.

35:39.704 --> 35:42.749
Okay, okay, I talk to your boss.
I do not talk to you, okay?

35:42.773 --> 35:45.219
You go talk to boss,
get him in here.

35:45.243 --> 35:47.087
Me and him, we can negotiate.

35:47.111 --> 35:49.556
Go get your boss. We talking.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.825
Yeah, all right, whatever.
Let me go get the boss, man.

35:51.849 --> 35:54.385
He'll talk to you.
I'll get the boss.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.856
Mm.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.759
Mm.

36:11.802 --> 36:14.581
So business is good, huh?

36:14.605 --> 36:16.383
Business is good.

36:16.407 --> 36:21.088
I have 40 trucks. I have
sole distributorship.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.257
None of my trucks bounce.

36:23.281 --> 36:25.359
I work hard.

36:25.383 --> 36:27.594
I work very hard.

36:27.618 --> 36:30.797
But I need consistent supply.
I need quality.

36:30.821 --> 36:32.790
So quality was good
last time, right?

36:34.258 --> 36:36.236
I'm hoping on our next shipment,

36:36.260 --> 36:41.632
we get a lower price
point, lower number.

36:43.401 --> 36:47.147
Quality should reflect
the price, no?

36:47.171 --> 36:48.916
Absolutely.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.452
So I give you good quality,
you give me good price.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.778
Mm.

36:57.582 --> 37:01.819
Human bodies should not
be that expensive.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.234
I beg to differ. I put
in a lot of work.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.937
And a human body never
goes out of style.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.195
Hmm...

37:12.997 --> 37:15.809
I like to be consistent,
and I like to be loyal,

37:15.833 --> 37:19.746
so we look forward to doing
more business, okay?

37:19.770 --> 37:22.516
- I like loyalty too.
- Hmm.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.685
Okay.

37:24.709 --> 37:25.852
Okay.

37:25.876 --> 37:27.878
Cheers.

37:44.395 --> 37:47.474
I am the last one out
of the office again.

37:47.498 --> 37:51.111
Kelly's gonna kill me
by the time I get home.

37:54.372 --> 37:57.517
Just want to snuggle up on
the couch and fall asleep.

37:57.541 --> 38:00.211
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Wait, hold up a sec.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.123
Edward!

38:03.147 --> 38:05.225
Oh, hey, Mr. McArthur!

38:05.249 --> 38:06.493
Got a minute?

38:06.517 --> 38:08.996
Uh, sure, yeah.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.365
Meet me for a drink.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.157
Yes, yeah, sure.

38:26.203 --> 38:27.981
So, Edward, do you shoot?

38:28.005 --> 38:30.817
No. Played some paintball.

38:30.841 --> 38:33.053
Well, Ian comes to me,

38:33.077 --> 38:37.257
and he tells me that you were
interested in our hunting trip.

38:37.281 --> 38:38.759
Um...

38:38.783 --> 38:40.227
Drink?

38:40.251 --> 38:42.229
Thank you. Um..,

38:42.253 --> 38:45.265
Mr. McArthur, could I
ask you a question?

38:45.289 --> 38:49.336
- Yeah, shoot.
- Are you married?

38:49.360 --> 38:52.172
Depends on the city and state.

38:52.196 --> 38:55.008
But, yeah, I am. Why do you ask?

38:55.032 --> 38:57.678
Do you have any kids?

38:57.702 --> 39:00.580
Kids. Do I have kids?

39:00.604 --> 39:03.283
No, I don't, but what does that
have to do with this trip?

39:03.307 --> 39:06.887
It's just been on my
mind a lot recently.

39:06.911 --> 39:09.089
You know, whether
I'd be a good dad,

39:09.113 --> 39:11.091
be able to provide
for my family.

39:11.115 --> 39:12.959
Look, you do very well
for yourself, Edward.

39:12.983 --> 39:16.029
28 years old, making
a lot of money.

39:16.053 --> 39:18.198
You know, you do
good for yourself.

39:18.222 --> 39:19.466
I do all right.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.068
How much do you make, actually?

39:21.092 --> 39:24.438
Um, well, I haven't even
been here quite a year,

39:24.462 --> 39:27.932
but I think I'm at 83, 84.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.712
So you don't do that well.

39:31.736 --> 39:35.649
Okay, how would you like
to double your money?

39:35.673 --> 39:38.752
You know, we could
absolutely double it.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.120
Sounds amazing.

39:40.144 --> 39:43.056
Look, you go on this
here camping trip.

39:43.080 --> 39:47.728
We camp, we hunt, we bond.

39:47.752 --> 39:50.130
That's what we do.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.399
If you're interested
in making more money,

39:52.423 --> 39:53.967
I can help with that.

39:53.991 --> 39:56.603
- Nick can help with that.
- All right.

39:56.627 --> 39:58.605
There's a lot of
money to be made.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.340
Let's go make some money.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.909
- Okay.
- All right.

40:02.933 --> 40:05.579
You are not a hunter!

40:05.603 --> 40:08.615
That's what I told
Ian, but he insisted.

40:08.639 --> 40:10.617
These are my bosses. What
was I supposed to say?

40:10.641 --> 40:12.686
Try no!

40:12.710 --> 40:14.688
Could you just support
me on this one

40:14.712 --> 40:16.590
just a little bit, please?

40:16.614 --> 40:20.127
Just this one, okay. If I
was to come home tomorrow

40:20.151 --> 40:22.095
and tell you that I
was going on vacation

40:22.119 --> 40:24.297
with a bunch of my
friends to kill animals,

40:24.321 --> 40:26.133
you would be okay with that.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.668
I'm not going to
kill any animals.

40:28.692 --> 40:30.537
I'm just going along for
the beer and the laughs.

40:30.561 --> 40:32.706
Have a good time.
It's a onetime thing.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.499
This is not okay!

40:41.539 --> 40:44.017
That's easy for you to say.
It's not your job on the line.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.977
You did not just
fucking say that!

40:50.481 --> 40:52.993
I'm the only one with
a job right now.

40:53.017 --> 40:54.961
I'm the only one
bringing in money.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.897
I'm trying to keep this
roof over our head.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.089
We just bought this house!

41:07.164 --> 41:09.533
Clean your own fucking dishes.

41:15.673 --> 41:16.673
Hello.

41:18.909 --> 41:22.556
Hey, William, it's Ed.
Am I bugging you?

41:22.580 --> 41:25.325
Nah, not at all.
Just eating chips.

41:25.349 --> 41:26.927
What is it, big guy?

41:26.951 --> 41:30.454
I just... I really need
someone to talk to.

41:33.224 --> 41:35.202
Ed, you were saying something
about a hunting trip?

41:35.226 --> 41:39.406
Yeah, it's for work, but...

41:39.430 --> 41:43.443
if it makes her this angry,
maybe I just shouldn't go.

41:43.467 --> 41:47.080
Right. Well, if it's for work,

41:47.104 --> 41:49.416
would you get fired
if you didn't go?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.585
No, no, that's not it.

41:51.609 --> 41:56.122
It's just my one chance to
get into this inner circle,

41:56.146 --> 41:58.225
to make something
for myself there,

41:58.249 --> 42:01.361
to be successful... for her.

42:01.385 --> 42:05.365
Listen, if you need
to stop helping me...

42:05.389 --> 42:06.900
No, no, that's not it.

42:06.924 --> 42:10.237
I should be able to
support my family.

42:10.261 --> 42:15.709
I should be able to take them
on vacations, pay for college.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.902
I just... That's not it at all.

42:18.969 --> 42:20.881
Does she know this?

42:20.905 --> 42:25.552
She might have her suspicions,
but I don't want to scare her.

42:25.576 --> 42:27.554
We just bought a house.

42:27.578 --> 42:30.123
She's not working.

42:30.147 --> 42:32.592
Right.

42:32.616 --> 42:34.995
Okay, go home, get some sleep.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.997
I'll come over and talk to her.

42:37.021 --> 42:39.633
Do what you need to do.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.301
Okay.

42:41.325 --> 42:44.437
All right. Thanks, William.

42:44.461 --> 42:48.141
She might be mad now,
but she loves you.

42:48.165 --> 42:49.776
It'll fade.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.435
I hope.

42:55.339 --> 42:56.917
Got a good batch here.

42:56.941 --> 43:00.186
200 points.

43:00.210 --> 43:03.189
500 points for them big
ass titties right there.

43:03.213 --> 43:05.525
I'm getting that. I'm
getting up in that.

43:05.549 --> 43:09.386
Yeah. It's a lot of
money on the table.

43:10.654 --> 43:14.100
Yeah, I'm winning this.

43:14.124 --> 43:16.169
Okay.

43:16.193 --> 43:18.696
I wanna win this.

43:22.032 --> 43:24.611
See, you care about points.

43:24.635 --> 43:26.646
I care about money.

43:26.670 --> 43:28.348
You should be coming in strong.

43:28.372 --> 43:31.151
You should be coming in fast.
You should come in hot!

43:31.175 --> 43:33.520
You're becoming a
little weak, Tony.

43:33.544 --> 43:35.689
You're thinking too much.

43:35.713 --> 43:38.315
How much is Nick giving
us to win this thing?

43:40.484 --> 43:42.562
I don't know. He said
something about a Ferrari.

43:42.586 --> 43:44.631
But what kind of
motivation do you need?

43:44.655 --> 43:46.256
I want to win.

43:48.592 --> 43:50.303
Well, let's have you win.

43:50.327 --> 43:53.573
What about the new
guy, is he in?

43:53.597 --> 43:56.209
Seems like it.

43:56.233 --> 43:57.601
All right.

44:00.537 --> 44:02.649
We good?

44:02.673 --> 44:04.250
Yeah.

44:04.274 --> 44:07.053
♪ I'm losing control
Help me, God ♪

44:07.077 --> 44:10.490
♪ Easy just to see the flames

44:50.254 --> 44:51.822
Hey, wake up!

44:55.726 --> 44:57.895
What? Where am I?

45:00.431 --> 45:03.410
I wish I knew. We got no idea.

45:03.434 --> 45:06.780
Help! Help! Help!

45:06.804 --> 45:08.882
Stop, stop yelling!

45:08.906 --> 45:11.384
Stop!

45:11.408 --> 45:14.120
We don't know where we
are, just like you,

45:14.144 --> 45:16.656
and nobody's out there
trying to find us,

45:16.680 --> 45:18.224
so what's the point?

45:18.248 --> 45:19.959
So shut the fuck
up already, yeah?

45:19.983 --> 45:23.329
Hey, she doesn't even
know what's going on.

45:23.353 --> 45:24.731
I don't give a fuck.

45:24.755 --> 45:26.356
Come on, stop cussing.

45:28.692 --> 45:33.606
Who are you people? Why
are they doing this?

45:33.630 --> 45:35.675
We have no idea, okay?

45:35.699 --> 45:38.278
We're in the same boat as you.

45:38.302 --> 45:40.080
We were kidnapped.

45:40.104 --> 45:42.515
This can't be happening.

45:42.539 --> 45:44.274
What's your name?

45:46.143 --> 45:47.821
What's your name?

45:47.845 --> 45:49.689
Uh, Maggie.

45:49.713 --> 45:52.592
Maggie, I'm Cynthia.

45:52.616 --> 45:56.262
Maggie, why don't you do
me a favor and tell us

45:56.286 --> 46:00.767
what the last thing you
remember before waking up is.

46:00.791 --> 46:04.061
I was leaving work. Um...

46:07.030 --> 46:09.476
I can't.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.645
She doesn't know. She
has been drugged.

46:12.669 --> 46:14.972
Leave her alone.

46:16.073 --> 46:19.519
I don't understand why!

46:19.543 --> 46:22.722
That's bullshit, man. Fuck.

46:22.746 --> 46:25.492
Hey, come on with the
language, please.

46:25.516 --> 46:27.026
Fuck, look how I am.

46:27.050 --> 46:29.062
You want to check my fucking language?
No way.

46:29.086 --> 46:31.297
You know, have some respect

46:31.321 --> 46:34.234
for everything that everybody
is going through in here.

46:34.258 --> 46:35.535
How dare you.

46:35.559 --> 46:37.137
Shit.

46:37.161 --> 46:39.873
How long have you
guys been here?

46:39.897 --> 46:45.211
Well, I've been
here the longest.

46:45.235 --> 46:47.747
About five days.

46:47.771 --> 46:49.983
I've been like two.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.508
Oh, God.

47:23.140 --> 47:25.618
Big Ed, what's up, man!

47:25.642 --> 47:28.521
I'm glad you could join us!
What took you so long?

47:28.545 --> 47:31.257
Gotta hit the road, man.

47:31.281 --> 47:32.926
Ready?

47:32.950 --> 47:36.462
Uh, why don't you go
ahead and do this?

47:36.486 --> 47:38.698
What's wrong with you?

47:38.722 --> 47:41.434
Nothing. It's just, you know, I
don't like needles and blood

47:41.458 --> 47:44.804
and all of that, so... I
mean, you'll be all right.

47:44.828 --> 47:47.130
- Fine.
- I'll be here if you need me.

47:50.167 --> 47:53.079
And they're all crooked like.

47:53.103 --> 47:55.215
I mean, it's obvious.

47:55.239 --> 47:56.449
What's going on?

47:56.473 --> 47:58.451
Nothing's going on. Nothing.

47:58.475 --> 48:00.453
But she knows who
Chase Thomas is.

48:00.477 --> 48:02.222
He's my ex-boyfriend.

48:02.246 --> 48:04.123
Guess he's telling me you
guys are looking for him.

48:04.147 --> 48:06.292
Would he be inside
the tattoo parlor?

48:06.316 --> 48:07.961
Man, he's not gonna be in there.

48:07.985 --> 48:10.129
- No?
- He doesn't hang in there.

48:10.153 --> 48:12.332
There's a bar down the street.
He's gonna be there.

48:12.356 --> 48:15.602
That's where you'll find him.
I can take you there.

48:15.626 --> 48:17.303
What's the name of the bar?

48:17.327 --> 48:18.327
Steak and Titties.

48:27.604 --> 48:31.985
Excuse me, we're looking for a Mr.
Chase Thomas.

48:32.009 --> 48:35.779
I don't know any Chase Thomas.
Sorry.

48:38.982 --> 48:41.351
You don't remember me, do you?

48:43.220 --> 48:47.166
Yeah, I do.

48:47.190 --> 48:50.203
Thomas Curry. His son went
missing over 2 1/2 years ago.

48:50.227 --> 48:52.229
Never found him.

48:56.633 --> 49:00.546
I don't know who she is.
How did she know all that?

49:00.570 --> 49:02.382
You know, I've been
trying to figure that out

49:02.406 --> 49:05.351
ever since she was recruited
from the academy.

49:05.375 --> 49:07.678
How are you, Mr. Curry?

49:10.047 --> 49:14.160
Shit. That's how I'm doing.
Like shit.

49:14.184 --> 49:16.253
Sorry about that.

49:18.989 --> 49:20.633
You guys,

49:20.657 --> 49:24.070
you FBI guys come in here...

49:24.094 --> 49:27.173
come in here for a drink, huh?

49:27.197 --> 49:29.709
You bring a young lady and
come here for a drink?

49:29.733 --> 49:33.179
Or should you be out
there doing your job?

49:33.203 --> 49:35.915
Doing your job
looking for my son.

49:35.939 --> 49:39.585
You go to the coffee
shops to have drinks,

49:39.609 --> 49:43.056
but you're not doing your
job looking for my son.

49:43.080 --> 49:46.559
It's been two fucking years!

49:46.583 --> 49:47.994
This is bullshit!

49:48.018 --> 49:49.429
Well, that's not fair!

49:49.453 --> 49:50.854
It's okay.

49:52.389 --> 49:55.768
Mr. Curry, we're
here chasing a lead.

49:55.792 --> 49:58.371
There was a kidnapping attempt.

49:58.395 --> 50:01.941
We want to stop that from
ever happening again.

50:01.965 --> 50:04.410
I'm sorry about your son,

50:04.434 --> 50:07.880
and in no way have we ever
given up hope of finding him

50:07.904 --> 50:09.882
or anyone, and we never will.

50:09.906 --> 50:10.906
That's him!

50:11.975 --> 50:15.955
- What?
- Hey, Mr. Thomas.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.224
We're with the FBI here,
and we need your help

50:18.248 --> 50:21.585
identifying someone who may be
wearing one of your tattoos.

50:25.055 --> 50:27.367
Oh, that dude? Yeah, I knew him.

50:27.391 --> 50:29.435
He's a ranch hand around here.

50:29.459 --> 50:32.138
I don't know which one though.
There's like 30 in the area.

50:32.162 --> 50:34.974
- Do you have a name?
- I don't.

50:34.998 --> 50:38.611
I just called him Pablo. That's
not his real name though.

50:38.635 --> 50:41.748
I just called him that 'cause
I thought it was funny.

50:41.772 --> 50:44.283
Thank you for your help, sir.

50:44.307 --> 50:47.310
- You coming?
- No, I'm gonna stay back.

50:58.088 --> 50:59.599
Contact the sheriff,

50:59.623 --> 51:02.135
have him get that sketch
to every man he's got.

51:02.159 --> 51:04.270
We need to check every
ranch in the area.

51:04.294 --> 51:06.472
We also need to
contact the Bureau.

51:06.496 --> 51:09.742
Yo! Dude, bro, what's up, man?

51:09.766 --> 51:11.844
- Oh, shit.
- You look good!

51:11.868 --> 51:13.780
- Thank you. You too.
- What are you doing here, man?

51:13.804 --> 51:16.082
Hey, Mom said you were supposed
to call her last night.

51:16.106 --> 51:17.316
Yeah, I'm working.

51:17.340 --> 51:19.419
McBride. This is my
partner McBride.

51:19.443 --> 51:21.854
- My brother.
- Nice to meet you.

51:21.878 --> 51:23.923
Uh, this is Ed from work.

51:23.947 --> 51:25.758
How you doing, Ed?
Nice to meet you.

51:25.782 --> 51:27.326
- McBride.
- Hi.

51:27.350 --> 51:29.762
So you really working, man?
Busting bad guys?

51:29.786 --> 51:33.266
Exactly. What are you doing?
I didn't expect to see you.

51:33.290 --> 51:35.034
What brings you here?

51:35.058 --> 51:37.027
Steak and titties.

51:38.962 --> 51:42.308
You guys sell insurance
or something?

51:42.332 --> 51:43.867
FBI.

51:46.336 --> 51:49.406
Pretty, Big Boy.

51:50.807 --> 51:53.820
This is for the
food and the women.

51:53.844 --> 51:55.879
Same as all the other girls.

51:57.714 --> 52:00.159
So, uh, what's going on
between you and your brother?

52:00.183 --> 52:02.028
I noticed some
tension out there.

52:02.052 --> 52:06.966
Man, we've been distant
for a while now.

52:06.990 --> 52:09.135
Since high school.

52:09.159 --> 52:11.671
I guess he's mad at me.

52:11.695 --> 52:14.340
Guess he thought I was gonna
be an FBI agent like him.

52:14.364 --> 52:16.342
Why would he think that?

52:16.366 --> 52:18.735
There's been cops in my
family for generations.

52:20.737 --> 52:22.315
Then why aren't you one?

52:22.339 --> 52:24.417
Do you know how much
cops make a year?

52:24.441 --> 52:25.685
- Yeah.
- Okay.

52:25.709 --> 52:27.687
Let me tell you something, man.

52:27.711 --> 52:31.424
I like to get money, baby, okay?

52:31.448 --> 52:33.826
And I'll do whatever
it takes to get that.

52:33.850 --> 52:36.920
Shit, I've got a
lifestyle to maintain.

52:39.222 --> 52:41.424
Could I get more, Kristen?

52:44.261 --> 52:46.839
Now how am I gonna convince you
to get one of these ladies, man?

52:46.863 --> 52:49.533
Come on, man. Come on, man.

52:50.734 --> 52:52.378
I didn't really like him before.

52:52.402 --> 52:54.714
I like him now, but I
just think he might be

52:54.738 --> 52:56.072
too much of a good guy.

52:57.641 --> 52:58.708
I think he might be right.

53:00.210 --> 53:03.689
He'll be fine. Trust me.

53:03.713 --> 53:06.025
All you gotta do is do him
like you did the others, okay?

53:06.049 --> 53:07.793
Yeah?

53:07.817 --> 53:10.096
We got lucky with Ian.

53:10.120 --> 53:13.299
He's a cool dude, but the
two guys before him,

53:13.323 --> 53:15.825
they were such good brokers
too, you know what I mean?

53:18.228 --> 53:20.630
You're both so negative, man.
Come on.

53:22.265 --> 53:25.745
Look forward to
tomorrow, all right?

53:25.769 --> 53:28.080
It'll be a good hunt.

53:28.104 --> 53:30.750
Do it or I'll kill ya.

53:30.774 --> 53:32.285
You sure you don't
want to go with us?

53:32.309 --> 53:34.420
Yeah.

53:34.444 --> 53:36.289
I'm sure I'm going on a picnic.

53:36.313 --> 53:37.390
Nah, I'm sure, man.

53:37.414 --> 53:40.393
It's a young man's game.

53:40.417 --> 53:43.129
Break in the new kid.

53:43.153 --> 53:44.654
It'll be fun.

53:47.657 --> 53:50.236
- Okay?
- You got it.

53:50.260 --> 53:52.338
Get the fuck outta here.

53:53.597 --> 53:55.441
Oh, wow, look at the 'hos!

53:55.465 --> 53:57.510
- Hello, ladies!
- Hi!

53:57.534 --> 53:59.436
Hell yeah!

54:01.838 --> 54:04.116
Look at the nice smile,
like he's been on a picnic.

54:04.140 --> 54:06.752
Oh, you're never gonna let me
live it down, will you, Nick?

54:06.776 --> 54:08.421
Look forward to tomorrow.

54:08.445 --> 54:10.213
Enjoy the hunt, okay? Be cool.

54:11.781 --> 54:13.826
I cannot believe that
he actually went

54:13.850 --> 54:15.194
after that big fight we had.

54:15.218 --> 54:17.430
He is selfish, you know that?
Selfish!

54:17.454 --> 54:19.865
He's not selfish.
He's a grown man.

54:19.889 --> 54:22.034
Him and his friends
acting like big men,

54:22.058 --> 54:23.970
killing defenseless animals.

54:23.994 --> 54:26.339
It's not that serious.
I've hunted before.

54:26.363 --> 54:28.474
Well, then you're sick too!
Get out of my house!

54:28.498 --> 54:30.476
Kell-bell, you need to calm
down and give him a break.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.311
He's your husband.

54:32.335 --> 54:35.348
He should've thought of that
before going off to play Rambo.

54:35.372 --> 54:37.383
He's not!

54:37.407 --> 54:41.287
He just wants to be
good at his new job.

54:41.311 --> 54:43.222
You let him do what
he needs to do

54:43.246 --> 54:46.859
to provide for his wife
and his future family.

54:46.883 --> 54:49.462
Excuse me? I'm not pregnant!

54:49.486 --> 54:52.632
Who the fuck told
you I was pregnant?

54:52.656 --> 54:54.190
Um...

54:56.860 --> 55:00.673
Damn girl, you know I love
you in those leather pants.

55:00.697 --> 55:02.141
You know I wore
'em just for you.

55:02.165 --> 55:03.676
You said you was coming back,

55:03.700 --> 55:05.411
so I had to take care
of that for you.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.146
And that's why I love vacation.

55:07.170 --> 55:09.248
Right? And it's a nice night.

55:09.272 --> 55:11.083
It is a beautiful night.

55:11.107 --> 55:14.153
Yeah. I know you're not looking
at the sky when you say it.

55:14.177 --> 55:18.391
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, the
sky is nice too, you know.

55:18.415 --> 55:19.992
Hey, Ed!

55:20.016 --> 55:23.229
Ed, man, come on out here
and get some of this!

55:23.253 --> 55:25.364
Oh, man.

55:25.388 --> 55:28.834
You know how it is when a
guy's on their first time.

55:28.858 --> 55:31.394
Oh, yeah, I remember yours.

55:35.632 --> 55:38.944
Hey. You're not outside
with the others.

55:38.968 --> 55:42.281
Why not? It looks like a blast.

55:42.305 --> 55:43.883
Not really my scene.

55:43.907 --> 55:45.885
I miss my wife enough as it is.

55:45.909 --> 55:47.453
I'd rather be in here.

55:47.477 --> 55:50.222
Fair enough. Understood.

55:50.246 --> 55:52.358
You're not the usual stockbroker

55:52.382 --> 55:54.427
that I've come across
in all my years.

55:54.451 --> 55:56.953
Too mild mannered.

55:58.488 --> 56:00.266
I don't know.

56:00.290 --> 56:03.569
I just see us, you know,
putting people together.

56:03.593 --> 56:06.639
People need to make money,
businesses need the investment.

56:06.663 --> 56:10.476
- Try not to bullshit anybody.
- Right.

56:10.500 --> 56:11.977
That's fair enough. Hey, oh!

56:12.001 --> 56:15.281
Ed, did you call your wife?

56:15.305 --> 56:18.651
Yeah. She didn't answer though.

56:18.675 --> 56:21.287
You don't have to come hunting
tomorrow if you don't want.

56:21.311 --> 56:23.680
You can always stay
in here and watch TV.

56:25.615 --> 56:28.594
Thanks, but I mean, that's
why I came up here, right?

56:28.618 --> 56:30.396
The bonding, the adventure.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.164
Just not the hookers.

56:32.188 --> 56:35.592
What's wrong with hookers?
I'm just kidding.

56:37.794 --> 56:42.675
Look, call your wife again
and get her on the phone.

56:42.699 --> 56:45.144
If you don't, and if she doesn't
pick up, leave a message.

56:45.168 --> 56:46.645
That's the only
advice I can give

56:46.669 --> 56:48.080
in all my years of fucking up.

56:48.104 --> 56:49.806
And cover your back.

56:52.542 --> 56:55.654
All right, I will.

56:55.678 --> 56:56.856
Thanks, Nick.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.815
Oh, hey, sure thing.

57:10.326 --> 57:13.939
Honey, it's me again.

57:13.963 --> 57:17.376
I miss you. I'm sorry.

57:17.400 --> 57:20.980
I'm sorry I came on
this stupid trip.

57:21.004 --> 57:23.182
I'm sorry for the fight.

57:23.206 --> 57:27.353
It's killing me how
angry you were.

57:27.377 --> 57:29.288
I love you.

57:29.312 --> 57:31.991
When I get back, we
need to get away.

57:32.015 --> 57:35.084
Just you and me away
from everything.

57:37.554 --> 57:39.889
Please call me
when you get this.

57:55.238 --> 57:57.583
Yeah, man, you almost got it!

57:57.607 --> 57:59.752
- You almost got it!
- I'll get it.

58:01.010 --> 58:03.055
Fucking motherfucker!

58:03.079 --> 58:05.724
What the fuck you trying to
do, you fucking little bitch!

58:05.748 --> 58:07.993
Man, who are you? Why are we here?
Stop it!

58:08.017 --> 58:10.062
Stop it, you son of a bitch!
Stop!

58:10.086 --> 58:12.998
Oh, my God!

58:13.022 --> 58:15.868
I'll fucking kill you!

58:19.729 --> 58:24.901
♪♪

59:51.287 --> 59:52.989
They don't usually
take this long.

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.512
Shit, man.

01:00:06.536 --> 01:00:08.304
They're waiting, huh?

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.786
I think that chick gave me
something last night, man.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.788
Which one? Talking
about Nick's girl?

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:17.556
Yeah, man.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.626
She was thick. I would have
taken something from her too.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.828
Wait, what you got, like
gonorrhea or something?

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.964
I don't know. It just itches.

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:27.700
Hope it's not herpes. That's
the gift that keeps on giving.

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:30.035
I know. You got it? You got it?

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:32.705
Ian, you don't see nothing?

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:35.040
Ian, anything? Ed, what's up?

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:37.509
- Nah, man.
- It's been over an hour.

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:40.145
What'd y'all do?

01:00:40.169 --> 01:00:43.048
- It's hiding.
- I don't see nothing.

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:45.084
I mean, maybe I'm not using
this thing right, but...

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.919
You put the small
thing in your eye

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.921
and the big part on the outside.

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.714
You get it? Okay.

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.397
He don't even know.
I should just...

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.398
Wanna move out?

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.499
What happened?

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.067
Wait, I think I see a guy.

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.268
Oh, okay, okay.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:04.937
He just walked out
of those trees.

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:07.339
Over there, like one o'clock.

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:10.576
- Okay, okay.
- Is he wearing loafers?

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:11.777
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.545
Hey, I got one, I got one!

01:01:13.569 --> 01:01:16.081
Let's do it, Ian, just like
I showed you, let's go!

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.974
Show him something!

01:01:20.376 --> 01:01:21.520
Whoo!

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.122
Yes! Let's go!

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:25.424
Who holds the lead now, baby?
Yeah!

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:26.925
Let's go!

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:30.262
Come on, give me that.
It's not heavy.

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:32.865
Let's go!

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:33.966
Whoo!

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.068
Slow this shit down!

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.160
Let's go!

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:43.075
That's what I'm
talking about, baby!

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:44.743
Heck yeah!

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:47.746
- 800?
- 800! 800!

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.416
He's still breathing.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.251
No, he's okay, he's okay.
I got it.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:54.953
Let me show you something.
Let me show you something.

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:57.222
See, this is what we do.
You go like this.

01:01:57.246 --> 01:01:59.958
Okay, here, take it.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:01.960
Take the fucking gun.

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:04.329
Look, you guys,
call an ambulance.

01:02:04.353 --> 01:02:06.231
Let's get fucking serious here.

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:07.433
Look, take the gun.

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:11.070
No, no. I'm not shooting anyone.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:13.772
This is what we're hunting, man.
Come on, don't embarrass me now.

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:15.674
Call a fucking ambulance.
He's still alive.

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:18.811
A fu... A fucking ambulance?

01:02:18.835 --> 01:02:21.513
- You guys are crazy.
- It's either him or you.

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.515
I'm not killing anybody.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:26.351
- You're not killing anybody?
- No.

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.844
Okay.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.690
Hey, is everything
all right in here?

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:35.260
Something... Something
is wrong with Edward.

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.596
- What are you saying?
- There's something wrong.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.864
I know. I can feel it.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:40.165
Calm down. Nothing's
wrong with Ed.

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.867
He's gonna be fine.

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.302
You're just coming down
from the big fight you had.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.336
It's okay.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.704
I want him here, Daddy.

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:47.306
I don't want him to be hurt.

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.208
He's fine. Everything's
gonna be fine.

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.009
Come here.

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:53.278
Oh, baby.

01:02:53.302 --> 01:02:54.713
Ah...

01:02:54.737 --> 01:02:56.806
So hard to be a woman.

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.550
Maggie!

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:14.023
- Chen!
- Maggie!

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:19.896
Oh, my God. This wasn't a dream.

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.012
Where is everyone?

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.881
Have you seen Cynthia?

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:30.482
No. Are you all right?

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:33.585
- Yeah.
- How long have you been here?

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:36.722
I don't know. I just woke up.
Overnight.

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:40.859
I was sleeping right over that
hill over there overnight too.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.828
Are we the only
ones that made it?

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:46.999
I guess. I don't know. I
haven't seen anyone else.

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:49.168
How long ago did you get out?

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:52.204
Right after Cynthia did.

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:54.439
I haven't seen her.

01:03:54.463 --> 01:03:56.441
Come on, they gotta be
around here somewhere.

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.676
We gotta get going
and find them.

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.369
- All right. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:04.307
Oh, God. All right, let's go.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.758
Hey, are you okay?

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:15.694
I feel a little faint,

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:18.197
like I'm gonna puke.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:20.732
Where do you think we are?

01:04:20.756 --> 01:04:22.801
We're in the middle of nowhere!

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.571
Nobody's here.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.206
We gotta keep moving.

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:29.374
We can't be too far from
civilization, right?

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.776
Do you want me to help you?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.111
No, I'm fine. What
about the others?

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.813
We don't even know if
they're alive or not.

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:37.482
We just gotta pick a
direction and go.

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:40.076
Okay, yeah, but where do we go?

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.556
Where do we go?

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.226
That's Cynthia! Cynthia!

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.894
Cynthia!

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:52.455
- Hey, we can't hear you!
- Cynthia, come here!

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.436
We can't hear you!

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.404
What?

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:02.908
What is she saying? Come here!

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.444
- Where are you going?
- Cynthia!

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:07.846
Run!

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:24.153
- Let's go.
- Did we lose them?

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.599
Time to load up!

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:30.369
We're getting a white rabbit!

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:33.796
What the fuck? I thought
we was hunting people.

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.677
You didn't see the list, Ian?

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.545
The white rabbit is the Asian
girl with big titties.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:42.347
- That's the white rabbit.
- Right.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:44.650
Get your head in the game!
All right, baby.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.118
Let's go get yours!

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.653
Let's go, let's go!

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:51.323
- I got dibs on the Asian bitch.
- We all got her.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.292
I don't know why
you're getting silent.

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:55.193
- Man, let's go!
- Spread out!

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:58.163
- You go that way.
- I got dibs on the...

01:05:58.187 --> 01:06:01.800
We'll see, we'll see, all right?
All right!

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:04.403
Hey, I already got Hajib, man.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:07.139
Money, money, money.

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:09.841
I got something already.

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:13.369
- Come on, baby, don't be shy!
- Hey, where you at, man?

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.006
Hey, where you at?

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:03.012
Hey, how you doing?

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.151
You see the gun, right?

01:08:10.486 --> 01:08:13.498
So you're not gonna run,

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:16.392
scream, nothing?

01:08:19.528 --> 01:08:21.640
When my mom passed,

01:08:21.663 --> 01:08:24.609
and she was on her deathbed,

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.779
she mentioned something to me.

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:31.349
She said your life really
does flash before your eyes

01:08:31.372 --> 01:08:33.185
when you're dying.

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:36.321
And I never understood
what she meant

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:39.415
because at that moment,
she was still alive.

01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:45.831
But when death is coming, and
you start to think about

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:50.068
all those little
moments in life,

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:52.194
that's the flash.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:58.143
Plus Jesus said in the Bible

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:01.212
that I should never fear the
one that could kill the body

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.149
because you can't
destroy my soul.

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:08.819
Instead, I should only fear
the one that has the ability

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:14.759
to destroy the mind, the
body, and the soul.

01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:19.731
Besides, I lived a happy life.

01:09:19.755 --> 01:09:24.035
So you're not gonna
run, scream or nothing?

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:28.029
Hell, you should be the
one that's afraid.

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.372
Okay.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.426
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:51.263
Whoo! I got one!

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.798
White man! 750!

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.700
Fuck you, son of a bitch!

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:58.136
Oh, come on, man, don't be
no poor sport on me, man.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:00.872
I ain't gonna play with
you no more, goddammit.

01:10:00.896 --> 01:10:03.041
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

01:10:03.065 --> 01:10:05.577
The fuck's wrong with me? What
the fuck is wrong with you?

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.212
Running and shit got
me out of breath!

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:10.749
Hey, man...

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:13.952
I really want the Asian bitch
with the big ass titties.

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:16.421
You fucking sick pig!

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:19.291
Oh, man, I heard it all before.

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:22.184
Fuck!

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:33.271
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:02.858
I hate using my hands!

01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:11.533
No, no, no, no, yeah, mm-hmm.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.998
It's okay.

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:38.637
It's okay.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:42.040
He can't hurt you anymore.

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:47.145
I got the bad guy. It's okay.

01:11:47.169 --> 01:11:49.538
Come on, let's get
you cleaned up.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.258
Damn...

01:12:00.282 --> 01:12:02.260
Oh, look at you and the Bulgari.

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:04.362
- McBRIDE: Yeah, right.
- Uh-huh.

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:08.290
- Hey, that's him!
- Freeze! Freeze! Hey!

01:12:20.436 --> 01:12:21.913
Look at you.

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:24.406
Motherfucker made me run.

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:31.856
Was it worth it, punk?
Stop resisting.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.692
We're doing this above
board, then kick his ass.

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.250
I'm gonna go call for backup.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.739
Hey, right on, man.

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:50.642
What the fuck, man? That
bitch roughed me up, dude.

01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:53.578
Go get the keys from her, man.
She's got 'em in her pocket.

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:56.271
What the fuck, man?
Go get the keys, man.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.808
Shut the fuck up.

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.244
You'll be okay.

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:06.791
I promise I wont shoot.

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:09.985
Not a pretty girl like yourself.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:20.305
You gotta be a fine bitch
if you wanna be a cop.

01:13:20.329 --> 01:13:23.132
You gotta be a fine bitch if
you wanna be a cop, right?

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:29.948
Come on.

01:13:29.972 --> 01:13:33.785
Maybe we can, you know...

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.544
work something out.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:59.377
He shot Chen!

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:03.539
He just started
bashing the head in.

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:09.578
He came up behind me and
started chocking me.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:17.152
I just want to go home.

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.824
I just want to go home.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:50.662
You saved their lives.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.088
Not really.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:57.702
I was just following you.

01:14:57.726 --> 01:15:01.439
Thought I'd go out on my own
and explore a little bit.

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.198
That's all I did.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.135
Hey, um...

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:13.084
I'm sorry about your partner.

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:14.586
Thanks.

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.378
Sorry about your son.

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:24.529
Yeah, well, at least
he didn't die in vain.

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:28.800
We stopped them. That's
what's important.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:31.035
They found a survivor out there.
Luckily he's a big guy.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:32.537
Anybody else that's
50 pounds lighter

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:33.905
would've died out there by now.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.931
- Let's go.
- I'm okay.

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.936
All right, I got an
adult male, mid 20's.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.072
He's got a gunshot wound,
upper thorax, left side.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.575
ETA is about 17 minutes.
All right.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.176
I'm alive?

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.336
Yeah, buddy, you're
alive, you're alive.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.790
I get to see my wife again.

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:30.862
I get to see her again.

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:32.487
You sure do, son.
