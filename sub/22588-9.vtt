Don't move.

00:49.481 --> 00:50.480
Escaped, gentlemen.

00:50.482 --> 00:53.517
Thanks to a bulletproof vest
escaped clean as hound's tooth.

00:53.519 --> 00:57.254
with precisely
one hundred thousand in cash.

00:57.256 --> 00:59.122
Need I tell you
what this means?

00:59.124 --> 01:00.924
The devil of an
unknown bandit.

01:00.926 --> 01:03.360
The one who strikes
every April the 1st

01:03.362 --> 01:05.095
for exactly a hundred grand.

01:05.096 --> 01:06.396
Correct, Chief O'Hara.

01:06.398 --> 01:09.032
Well, the third year running
an identical pattern.

01:09.034 --> 01:12.436
Got a call from the president of
the Gotham City League of Banks.

01:12.438 --> 01:15.639
He told me bluntly
the league is becoming uneasy.

01:15.641 --> 01:16.974
Sure and I don't blame them.

01:16.976 --> 01:19.509
A fine bunch of April fools
we're looking.

01:19.511 --> 01:21.178
Oh, don't castigate yourselves.

01:21.180 --> 01:24.882
You're tip-top officers,
all of you.

01:24.884 --> 01:26.450
But still..

01:26.452 --> 01:27.985
...two years on this case

01:27.987 --> 01:31.255
and you men haven't
turned up a single clue.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.291
Any reason to think
you'll do better this time?

01:34.293 --> 01:37.628
This one is bigger
than the lot of us.

01:37.630 --> 01:41.265
Commissioner...we need help.

01:45.571 --> 01:47.671
Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

01:47.673 --> 01:50.908
Ascend to the roof, Chief
O'Hara, turn on the Bat-signal.

01:50.910 --> 01:54.144
- Yes, sir.
- I'll try the hotline.

01:56.282 --> 01:59.216
<i> No one to answer</i>
<i> the Bat-phone.</i>

01:59.218 --> 02:02.352
<i> Because Bruce Wayne</i>
<i> and Dick Grayson</i>

02:02.354 --> 02:03.954
<i> along with Alfred the butler</i>

02:03.956 --> 02:07.190
<i> are on the roof</i>
<i> of Wayne Manor..</i>

02:07.192 --> 02:08.658
<i> ...stargazing.</i>

02:08.661 --> 02:10.627
How's that, Master Dick?

02:10.628 --> 02:12.462
Fine, thanks, Alfred.

02:12.464 --> 02:14.564
Wow, the rings of Saturn.

02:14.566 --> 02:16.466
This is sure some fun, Bruce.

02:16.468 --> 02:18.936
Astronomy is more
than mere fun, Dick.

02:18.938 --> 02:19.569
- It is?
- Yes.

02:19.571 --> 02:22.105
It helps give us
a sense of proportion.

02:22.107 --> 02:23.707
Reminds us how little
we are really.

02:23.709 --> 02:27.110
People tend to forget
that sometimes.

02:27.112 --> 02:27.978
Gosh, yes, that's right.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.615
I'll bet I'll see those rings
a little differently this time.

02:31.617 --> 02:33.417
If you boys have
finished stargazing

02:33.419 --> 02:36.987
there's a delicious rib roast
on the dining room table.

02:36.989 --> 02:40.390
Just one more minute,
Aunt Harriet.

02:48.100 --> 02:51.401
Goodness gracious,
look up at that cloud.

02:51.403 --> 02:53.704
Isn't that the
famous Bat-signal?

02:53.706 --> 02:55.539
'It sure is, Aunt Harriet.'

02:55.541 --> 02:58.508
Commissioner Gordon
must wish the services

02:58.510 --> 03:02.112
of the, ahem, Dynamic Duo.

03:02.114 --> 03:04.047
Mercy alive.

03:04.049 --> 03:06.049
Whoever that unknown Batman is

03:06.051 --> 03:07.484
I hope he sees the signal.

03:07.486 --> 03:11.388
Uh, great heavens,
what a fool I am.

03:11.390 --> 03:13.623
- Isn't today Wednesday, Alfred?
- Indeed, sir.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.058
Wednesday night,
Gotham Town hall.

03:15.060 --> 03:18.195
We have tickets to that lecture
on Latin-American affairs.

03:18.197 --> 03:19.429
Holy Venezuela, you're right.

03:19.431 --> 03:21.398
If we dash, we can
catch part of it.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.467
- Excuse us, Aunt Harriet.
- Goodnight, Aunt Harriet.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.203
Oh, and don't worry about
Dick's supper, Aunt Harriet.

03:26.205 --> 03:30.007
We'll have some good,
hot pancakes later.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.342
Dick Grayson.

03:32.344 --> 03:34.311
Running out on a rib roast

03:34.313 --> 03:36.146
for a lecture in politics?

03:36.148 --> 03:40.450
Alfred, get ready to catch me.
I think I'm gonna faint.

03:40.452 --> 03:42.119
My pleasure, madam.

03:51.363 --> 03:53.430
Sorry about the holdup.
What's the problem?

03:53.432 --> 03:55.432
You-you just said it
yourself, Batman.

03:55.434 --> 03:58.802
- "A holdup." Big.
- We're on our way.

03:58.804 --> 04:01.304

Well, one clue that
slug from the guard's pistol

05:56.589 --> 05:59.523
after it ricocheted from
the bandit's bulletproof vest.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.758
We hoped that
it might contain

06:00.760 --> 06:02.760
identifiable fibers
from the bandit's clothing.

06:02.762 --> 06:05.195
- No luck, eh?
- Our hopes were blasted.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.730
Lab report, negative.

06:06.732 --> 06:08.065
I'll take this anyway.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.067
Our own equipment
at the Bat-cave

06:10.069 --> 06:11.135
may prove more revealing.

06:11.137 --> 06:15.205
Meantime, let's ponder
the crook's motive.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.643
A hundred thousand smackers.
That's the motive.

06:19.645 --> 06:20.110
But why?

06:20.112 --> 06:23.647
Why exactly one hundred
thousand dollars?

06:23.649 --> 06:26.283
Leaving another
half million untouched.

06:26.285 --> 06:28.619
Batman's right.
That has some meaning.

06:28.621 --> 06:30.888
The same strange
pattern every year.

06:30.890 --> 06:34.291
Precisely a hundred thousand
each April 1st.

06:34.293 --> 06:36.994
Glory be, I've got it.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.629
It's to pay his income taxes.

06:38.631 --> 06:42.366
A loyal taxpayer stooping
to criminal methods?

06:42.368 --> 06:45.336
Uh, sure, when you
put it that way.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.205
I fear you're
growing cynical, Chief O'Hara.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.040
The notion
of a faithful taxpayer

06:50.042 --> 06:51.642
robbing a bank is absurd.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.011
It's this case
that's driving me mad.

06:54.013 --> 06:57.181
'We're up against
a blank wall.'

06:57.183 --> 06:58.248
Not even a single lead.

06:58.250 --> 07:02.152
Right, Robin. So what do
we do in such a case?

07:02.154 --> 07:04.922
- We make a lead.
- 'Exactly.'

07:04.924 --> 07:05.756
"Make a lead?"

07:05.758 --> 07:07.124
In heaven's name,
Boy Wonder, how?

07:07.126 --> 07:11.629
Don't worry. Batman will figure
it out. Won't you, Batman?

07:18.170 --> 07:20.037
Operator, this
is Batman speaking.

07:20.039 --> 07:22.306
Get me the editor
of the Gotham City Times.

07:22.308 --> 07:25.676
I have a scheme to throw
our enemies into confusion.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.678
I'm going to plant a story.

07:42.828 --> 07:45.396
Extra, extra.
Get your newspaper here.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.866
Read about the bandit
who stole the counterfeit money.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.135
Yes, that's what he did.
Counterfeit money.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.703
Friend, what was
counterfeit money

07:52.705 --> 07:55.072
doing in the vault of
the First National Bank?

07:55.074 --> 07:57.074
If you wanna know,
buy a paper.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.243
I ain't no special
news service.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.212
I wonder what it was
doing there?

08:02.214 --> 08:05.416
Oh, "Awaiting at
the bank for disposal."

08:05.418 --> 08:07.685
Makes sense.
Hey, paper here.

08:07.687 --> 08:11.221
Read about the bandit
who stole the counterfeit money.

08:11.223 --> 08:14.024
Here. Read about it, right now.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.863
How are you doing with
that bullet, Batman?

08:19.865 --> 08:21.832
'Amazing. Come here and look.'

08:21.834 --> 08:25.169
Any trace of what
the crook was wearing?

08:26.739 --> 08:27.171
Wow.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.806
Those are fiber
patterns, alright.

08:28.808 --> 08:32.342
Notice from left to right.
First, nylon coveralls.

08:32.344 --> 08:36.380
Next, what seems
to be...orange wool.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.347
And silk.

08:38.350 --> 08:40.150
Unless I'm crazy,
about ten layers

08:40.152 --> 08:41.184
of different colored silks.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.253
Square on the button, Robin.

08:43.255 --> 08:45.889
This bullet passed
through 13 layers

08:45.891 --> 08:48.459
of brightly-colored silk.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.326
Holy rainbow.

08:49.328 --> 08:53.831
- Who'd wear a rig like that?
- Let me show you a clue.

08:55.434 --> 08:59.169
Gosh, that's a stumper.
I think it's organic, though.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.504
Correct, the unmistakable

09:00.506 --> 09:03.974
spectrographic pattern
of ambergris.

09:03.976 --> 09:04.408
Ambergris?

09:04.410 --> 09:07.111
You mean that smelly, oily stuff
they use in making perfumes?

09:07.113 --> 09:11.081
Correct again, which leads to
only one possible conclusion.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.417
- The crook was a lady.
- Hardly a lady, Robin.

09:13.419 --> 09:16.487
- But female, yes.
- The Catwoman?

09:16.489 --> 09:19.923
No, impossible.
She's safely up the river.

09:19.925 --> 09:23.227
- Then who could she be?
- I don't know.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.463
I think...we're faced
with some new

09:26.465 --> 09:30.534
super-criminal
not in our crime file.

09:39.178 --> 09:43.247
- Yes, Batman.
- Here's a tip, commissioner.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.114
Alert the entire force.

09:44.116 --> 09:47.551
Be on the lookout for a woman
in an orange dress.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.353
Good heavens, a woman.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.121
What is the world coming to?

09:51.123 --> 09:53.791
We can't stop to
worry about that now.

09:53.793 --> 09:56.293
Our task is to fight crime.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.228
Goodbye for now.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.464
The morning newspaper, sir.
It just arrived.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.733
Ah, good. Thanks.
I want to read this.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.002
My pleasure, sir.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.640
Uh, excuse me, sir.

10:09.642 --> 10:13.077
Would you and Master Robin
be departing soon?

10:13.079 --> 10:15.813
- Oh, indeed, we will.
- Thank you, sir.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.083
Then I'll go and get
the vacuum cleaner.

10:22.722 --> 10:24.588
Looks perfect, Batman.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.757
Yep, it's all there.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.493
Just the way I dictated it.

10:29.495 --> 10:29.894
Oh, boy.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.695
I'll bet somewhere
in Gotham City

10:31.697 --> 10:34.799
there's one really
shook lady crook.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.434
I hope so, Robin.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.804
Now to make this
planted story sprout.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.044
<i> Meanwhile, behind the facade</i>

10:46.046 --> 10:49.114
<i> of this innocent-looking</i>
<i> bookstore</i>

10:49.116 --> 10:51.483
<i> there lurks the secret workshop</i>

10:51.485 --> 10:54.786
<i> of a strange</i>
<i> Albanian genius..</i>

10:54.788 --> 10:57.823
...<i> Eivol Ekdal.</i>

11:06.867 --> 11:09.067
Sorry to be late, Eivol.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.635
Counterfeit you bring me.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.473
To me, Eivol Ekdal,
worthless counterfeit.

11:14.675 --> 11:16.041
Look.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.811
How could I know, Eivol?

11:19.813 --> 11:22.514
"How could I know, Eivol?"

11:22.516 --> 11:24.049
"Zelda the Great.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.618
Even greater than Houdini."

11:26.620 --> 11:29.721
Without the marvelous
escape devices which I

11:29.723 --> 11:31.823
Eivol Ekdal made
for you each year

11:31.825 --> 11:33.091
you would be nothing.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.826
Stop taunting me.

11:34.828 --> 11:37.229
I've always paid
you well, haven't I?

11:37.231 --> 11:42.234
I've even taken up a life
of crime to pay your price.

11:43.237 --> 11:44.035
Poor Zelda.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.704
And I suppose, it offends

11:45.706 --> 11:48.507
your lofty principles, huh?

11:48.809 --> 11:51.042
But it does, Eivol.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.245
I hate robbing banks.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.881
And all I ever wanted
to be was

11:55.883 --> 11:58.783
a poor...but honest magician.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.819
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.621
Aww.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.959
I thought so.
A glycerin tear producer.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.695
And now, my conscience-stricken
little crocodile

12:10.697 --> 12:13.832
wipe away those
disgusting phony tears

12:13.834 --> 12:16.234
'and let's talk sensibly, huh?'

12:16.236 --> 12:19.137
But what am I
going to do, Eivol?

12:19.139 --> 12:20.805
Hmm, that is the question.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.141
My act's been slipping,
you know.

12:23.143 --> 12:26.044
If I don't come up
with a super-sensational escape

12:26.046 --> 12:28.713
this year...I'm finished.

12:28.715 --> 12:32.584
Such bad luck that you're
stuck with those counterfeits.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.186
Such unusually bad luck.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.322
For you see..

12:38.258 --> 12:39.057
Yes?

12:39.059 --> 12:41.826
I had it all prepared
for you, Zelda.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.928
Guaranteed without question

12:42.930 --> 12:46.965
the most super-sensational
escape device ever invented.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.734
Even by me, Eivol Ekdal.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.102
Oh, show me.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.572
Well, since you
can't pay my price

12:53.574 --> 12:54.906
of one hundred
thousand dollars

12:54.908 --> 12:57.909
I hardly see the point.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.278
Well, alright.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.654
Behold, Eivol Ekdal's

13:09.656 --> 13:11.122
inescapable doom trap.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.326
A cage constructed
of utterly unbreakable

13:14.328 --> 13:15.760
jet-age plastic.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.162
Will they believe that?

13:17.164 --> 13:17.829
Of course.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.998
Before you get inside
you will demonstrate.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.301
I'll show you.
Duck behind the trunk.

13:32.713 --> 13:33.945
Oh, it's fantastic.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.814
The plastic isn't
even scratched.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.017
Of course, I told you.
It's unbreakable.

13:41.288 --> 13:44.656
Please, come up on the stage.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.258
Examine more closely.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.198
Step inside.

13:54.635 --> 13:57.636
The hinged wall is
closed and padlocked

13:57.638 --> 13:59.070
by member of the audience.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.206
From the floor grill
is pouring

14:01.208 --> 14:02.273
a deadly-colored gas.

14:02.275 --> 14:06.344
The audience is screaming
for you to escape.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.346
How do you do it?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.248
Why, it's too simple.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.017
I lift the iron grill

14:12.019 --> 14:13.151
slip out a trapdoor.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.920
The colored gas
conceals my actions.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.991
Please...try it.

14:24.665 --> 14:26.197
- Oh!
- It's shocking, eh?

14:26.199 --> 14:28.266
Oh, the grill's electrified.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.101
Violently.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.737
Oh, it's wonderful.

14:32.739 --> 14:33.972
Oh, wonderful.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.440
Now, tell me..

14:35.442 --> 14:38.777
...what's the secret
of my getting out?

14:39.713 --> 14:44.282
My dear, you don't even
get in until I get my money.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.850
But I will give you one hint.

14:45.852 --> 14:49.354
The secret of my doom
trap involves..

14:49.356 --> 14:50.755
Guess who?

14:50.757 --> 14:54.059
The Caped Crusader, Batman.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.061
- Batman?
- Mm-hmm.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.329
Oh, but you must
be mad, Eivol.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.465
He's a sworn enemy
of crooks like us.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.901
But he's also, what you
only pretend to be

15:02.903 --> 15:06.371
the worlds greatest
escape artist.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.909
- Ah!
- Mm-hmm.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.345
Yes. Now I begin to see.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.882
In perfect
working order, Batman.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.085
All systems A-Okay.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.453
Right.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.789
Bait for the mousetrap.

15:24.791 --> 15:26.758
Let's go.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.965
Atomic batteries to power.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.133
Turbines to speed.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.803
Clear. Ready to move out.

15:49.149 --> 15:54.018
Not one more word until I get
my hundred thousand dollars.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.353
Well, how will I find it?

15:55.355 --> 15:58.189
They'll be watching
all the banks like hawks.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.426
Please. Read
the newspaper again.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.862
Please.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.207
"The Star of Samarkand."

16:16.209 --> 16:19.511
- That fabulous emerald.
- Exactly.

16:19.513 --> 16:21.880
It will be at
Stonewin's Jewelry

16:21.882 --> 16:24.315
on display one day only.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.485
Not quite
as convenient as cash

16:27.487 --> 16:30.054
but quite acceptable.

16:30.056 --> 16:32.090
Quick, let me think.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.358
I'll, uh, I'll need equipment.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.460
Oh, please,
consider the contents

16:35.462 --> 16:39.097
of my humble
secret workshop as yours.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.899
- A trick mirror.
- Yes.

16:40.901 --> 16:42.534
- A disguise.
- Hmm.

16:42.536 --> 16:44.502
And a set of..

16:44.504 --> 16:47.539
- Wait a minute.
- What is the matter?

16:47.541 --> 16:50.475
- Ha ha. Batman.
- Oh?

16:50.477 --> 16:54.112
You're a strange Albanian
genius, Eivol

16:54.114 --> 16:55.580
but you're also
bit of a fool.

16:55.582 --> 17:00.585
Don't you see, this is almost
a bit too convenient?

17:00.587 --> 17:02.387
What do you mean?

17:02.389 --> 17:04.189
My feminine intuition
tells me

17:04.191 --> 17:08.859
I better have
two strings to my bow.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.262
The Star of Samarkand..

17:11.263 --> 17:16.034
...it could be
a typical Batman trap.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.553
How does it look,
Ms. Stonewin?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.521
I beg your pardon?

17:36.523 --> 17:39.991
This emerald of ours,
does it look life-like?

17:39.993 --> 17:40.892
Oh, yes, the emerald.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.262
- Do you feel alright, ma'am?
- Hmm? Oh, yes. Certainly.

17:44.264 --> 17:48.466
It's just that I've read so
often about you and Batman

17:48.468 --> 17:49.901
in the press and well

17:49.903 --> 17:53.071
the experience of actually
viewing you in the flesh

17:53.073 --> 17:55.907
is faintly faint-making.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.243
Please, Ms. Stonewin, there's
no reason to be disturbed.

17:58.245 --> 18:02.114
That's right. Behind our mask,
we're perfectly ordinary people.

18:02.116 --> 18:03.481
This unique garb of ours

18:03.483 --> 18:05.150
is one of our weapons
in crime fighting.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.753
It shouldn't bother anyone
who abides by the law.

18:07.755 --> 18:09.488
Of course.

18:09.490 --> 18:10.622
Do forgive me.

18:10.624 --> 18:13.592
You were saying about
that synthetic emerald.

18:13.594 --> 18:14.727
Bait, Ms. Stonewin.

18:14.729 --> 18:17.529
Green cheese to trap
a dangerous female bandit.

18:17.531 --> 18:22.101
- We need your cooperation.
- Oh, just name it, Batman.

18:22.103 --> 18:23.068
I'll do it.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.170
Our scheme is to
conceal ourselves

18:25.172 --> 18:27.239
somewhere on
the premises.

18:27.241 --> 18:29.074
Just upstairs.

18:29.076 --> 18:31.577
That balcony, Batman.

18:32.413 --> 18:36.081
Perfect. When the crook strikes,
we'll pounce on our prey.

18:36.083 --> 18:39.351
Even if she eludes us,
we've still got her.

18:39.353 --> 18:40.119
Robin's right.

18:40.121 --> 18:42.354
The inside of the
Star of Samarkand

18:42.356 --> 18:43.555
is hollow, you see.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.490
It contains a tiny

18:44.492 --> 18:45.691
super-power homing transmitter.

18:45.693 --> 18:48.093
We'll pick up the beam
in our Batmobile.

18:48.095 --> 18:51.563
You're nearly
simply too much, Batman.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.065
I hope so, Ms. Stonewin.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.166
Too much for this crook anyway.

18:54.168 --> 18:56.702
Robin, run outside,
take a final check.

18:56.704 --> 18:58.670
Roger.

18:58.672 --> 19:01.306
In the street,
Ms. Stonewin. Look.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.475
'Two of Chief O'Hara's
finest patrolmen'

19:03.477 --> 19:06.512
'in the guise
of power company workers.'

19:06.514 --> 19:09.281
'And under the tent..'

19:09.283 --> 19:12.051
...our trump card.

19:12.053 --> 19:14.086
The Batmobile.

19:24.732 --> 19:27.699
As I guessed,
another Batman trap.

19:27.701 --> 19:30.469
I'll have to get my hundred
thousand somewhere else.

19:30.471 --> 19:33.572
Somewhere Batman
wouldn't even dream of.

19:33.574 --> 19:38.477
And if it's games they want,
they'll have 'em.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.384
Do you read me, Batman?

19:45.386 --> 19:46.518
Loud and clear.

19:46.520 --> 19:50.089
Emerald's working.
All systems go.

19:50.091 --> 19:51.190
Alright, come back inside.

19:51.192 --> 19:54.326
We'll hide on the balcony.
Over and out.

19:54.328 --> 19:56.195
Roger.

19:57.331 --> 19:59.531
<i> Traps and counter traps.</i>

19:59.533 --> 20:04.436
<i> Back in the front hall</i>
<i> of Stately Wayne Manor..</i>

20:15.182 --> 20:17.649
Mr. Wayne's residence.

20:18.686 --> 20:19.418
What?

20:19.420 --> 20:23.789
Dick Grayson struck in the head
with a batted ball?

20:23.791 --> 20:27.192
Oh, dear.
I'll get there at once.

20:27.194 --> 20:28.594
Which playground is it?

20:28.596 --> 20:34.533
Oh, you've already sent
a special taxi to pick me up?

20:34.535 --> 20:37.769
Why, that's very
kind of you, Ms..

20:37.771 --> 20:40.873
What did you say
your name was?

20:40.875 --> 20:42.875
Ms. Smith?

20:42.877 --> 20:46.178
Play-playground matron.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.714
Uh, thank you, Ms. Smith.

20:48.716 --> 20:52.851
Thank you so much.
I'll be waiting out in front.

21:02.463 --> 21:05.197
It's been
almost two hours.

21:05.199 --> 21:06.532
Could we have
made a mistake?

21:06.534 --> 21:08.700
- I don't see how.
- Me neither.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.803
But still
we're only human.

21:32.560 --> 21:33.692
Good morning,<i> madame.</i>

21:33.694 --> 21:35.928
Would you care to see
the Star of Samarkand?

21:35.930 --> 21:40.365
Ah, yes, I, uh,
I would indeed, young lady.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.501
This way please.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.541
- Look.
- The old lady in black.

21:51.645 --> 21:54.379
Oh! It's amazing.

21:54.381 --> 21:57.783
It looks almost real,
doesn't it?

21:57.785 --> 21:58.984
What?

22:16.470 --> 22:18.804
'Surrender!'

22:18.806 --> 22:22.007
'We've got you, bank bandit.'

22:22.610 --> 22:25.744
Holy hole in a doughnut!
What happened?

22:25.746 --> 22:27.579
She's a master illusionist.

22:27.581 --> 22:28.747
She projected
a false image

22:28.749 --> 22:31.883
with those tiny
mirrors in her hat.

22:32.753 --> 22:37.556
- The emerald's gone.
- And so are all my customers.

22:37.891 --> 22:40.459
Officer Clancy,
alert the entire force.

22:40.461 --> 22:43.428
Unwrap the Batmobile.

22:43.931 --> 22:46.898
Don't worry.
We'll get her.

22:51.505 --> 22:52.604
Batman, look, in the gutter.

22:52.606 --> 22:55.040
Fake emerald
with our homing transmitter.

22:55.042 --> 22:57.042
She threw it away.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.911
The tricky,
little she-devil.

23:00.314 --> 23:02.481
She must have smelled
our trap.

23:02.483 --> 23:04.850
She was merely
taunting us.

23:04.852 --> 23:05.851
So what's her real game?

23:05.853 --> 23:09.721
Hey, Batman,
your Bat-phone's blinking.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.761
- Batman here.
- Shocking news, Batman.

23:15.763 --> 23:19.364
Your scheme has worked, but
not quite the way you planned.

23:19.366 --> 23:21.566
- What do you mean?
- Your counterfeit story.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.968
It's driven the felon
to strike again.

23:22.970 --> 23:26.338
'Not at the Star of Samarkand.
She's pulled a kidnap.'

23:26.340 --> 23:29.441
- Who?
- A Mrs. Harriet Cooper.

23:30.344 --> 23:30.709
What?

23:30.711 --> 23:33.645
Oh, a-a clever choice
of victim, Batman.

23:33.647 --> 23:36.448
This Mrs. Cooper is the
aunt of young Dick Grayson

23:36.450 --> 23:39.351
who's the ward
of millionaire, Bruce Wayne.

23:39.353 --> 23:40.952
Great heavens!

23:40.954 --> 23:42.621
Has there been
a ransom note?

23:42.623 --> 23:43.889
That's the worst of it, Batman.

23:43.891 --> 23:45.924
We've received a note
with instructions

23:45.926 --> 23:47.993
for one hundred thousand dollars

23:47.995 --> 23:50.262
to be delivered
within one hour.

23:50.264 --> 23:51.897
One hour only.

23:51.899 --> 23:54.700
And no one can
find Bruce Wayne.

23:54.702 --> 23:58.370
Holy backfire. What have
they done to poor Aunt..

23:58.372 --> 24:01.540
What have they done
to that Mrs. Cooper?

24:06.080 --> 24:08.347
<i> Holy backfire's right!</i>

24:08.349 --> 24:11.950
<i> Aunt Harriet</i>
<i> has just one hour.</i>

24:11.952 --> 24:13.018
<i> What'll it be?</i>

24:13.020 --> 24:14.820
<i> Splash or salvation?</i>

24:14.822 --> 24:17.956
<i> Hold a hopeful breath</i>
<i> for Aunt Harriet</i>

24:17.958 --> 24:20.025
<i> until tomorrow night.</i>

24:20.027 --> 24:21.927
