00:01.401 --> 00:02.669
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:03.002 --> 00:05.672
Please, God, if he's mine,
just give me a sign.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.809
How do you forget about a wife?

00:10.076 --> 00:12.846
Did you know me and your husband
have been sleeping together?

00:12.912 --> 00:15.815
You want me to stop working
so I could chauffeur the kids around?

00:15.882 --> 00:17.917
They should come live with me full-time.

00:17.984 --> 00:18.952
All I do is work.

00:19.586 --> 00:20.653
<i>-She came to me.
- Yeah?</i>

00:20.720 --> 00:23.957
'Cause she wants to file a complaint
against you to HR

00:24.457 --> 00:25.625
for intimidation,

00:25.692 --> 00:28.294
- publicly disparaging her character...
- What? No!

00:28.361 --> 00:31.765
and accusing her of having an affair
with her superior, me.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.801
I want to win an Emmy
for producing ABC news.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.638
You have two kids by two different men.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.774
Get off of me. What is wrong with you?

00:40.840 --> 00:43.076
Ma'am, calm down. Tase her, tase her.

00:47.013 --> 00:48.148
I'm seeing someone.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.317
I just feel like I need closure.

00:51.651 --> 00:53.119
Like, if I knew why,

00:53.520 --> 00:54.921
then I could let him go.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.490
<i>He's with somebody else, that's why.</i>

00:57.791 --> 00:59.692
<i>Go out there and get your happiness.</i>

00:59.759 --> 01:01.461
And if it's not David, move on.

01:01.528 --> 01:05.031
<i>- You're not on drugs, are you, Patrick?
- A little something to help me focus.</i>

01:05.098 --> 01:07.434
It's far from coke.
I'll never do that again.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.402
You swore you'd never do any drug,

01:09.469 --> 01:10.670
and broke that promise.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.073
I've got to hear this. You are telling me
you have never,

01:14.374 --> 01:17.310
- ever been with a white boy?
- Never.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.578
- Seriously?
- Ever.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.313
All right.

01:21.314 --> 01:22.382
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:22.449 --> 01:25.452
<i>He definitely exceeded
by stereotypical expectations.</i>

01:26.386 --> 01:28.154
One stereotype that was true,

01:28.755 --> 01:30.156
they do love to chomp the box.

01:30.223 --> 01:31.958
- You should've told me.
- Yes, they do.

01:32.025 --> 01:33.593
I like black men.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.496
I want black love.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.094
Can you give me just one minute?

02:36.456 --> 02:39.058
You've never had
a successful committed relationship.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.326
That's what I'm getting.

02:40.393 --> 02:43.029
I suppose that depends
on what you consider successful.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.831
I've had a couple of men propose.

02:45.131 --> 02:47.400
One was married. I didn't know it.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.769
Why do you think
a matchmaker can help you?

02:50.270 --> 02:51.571
You're the best, right?

02:51.871 --> 02:53.239
But I'm not a miracle worker.

02:53.973 --> 02:56.709
The high-achieving professional men
and women I represent

02:56.776 --> 02:58.945
must be willing to do something
that isn't easy.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.615
They must get past the surface
and find out what's really going on.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.517
Absolutely, and I will.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.153
- You've been in New York, what?
- Two days.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.623
To start a big, high-profile new job,
no less?

03:11.024 --> 03:11.991
Yes.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.562
I suggest you wait a few months.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.399
No. This is my opportunity
for a fresh start.

03:20.199 --> 03:21.501
I mean, not just with my job,

03:22.602 --> 03:23.570
but with everything.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.209
The questionnaire and self-assessment
suggest a start.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.312
There are rules.

03:33.446 --> 03:34.547
Whatever it takes.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.816
Come on, baby. We rose from the ashes

03:36.883 --> 03:38.484
to get to where we are now.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.086
We got to acknowledge it, momma.

03:40.486 --> 03:43.890
Here's to your new kick-ass job
in the number one market in the country,

03:43.957 --> 03:45.592
New York City, baby!

03:46.192 --> 03:48.094
And to the woman who got me the job.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.663
I got you interview. You got the job.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.837
OK, looks like you have a different
kind of celebration in mind for tonight.

04:00.373 --> 04:01.741
You think he's a good lay?

04:01.808 --> 04:04.110
I know that there's not, like, a tell.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.679
- But if you have to take a guess.
- Why?

04:06.746 --> 04:08.615
This is my last chance to have sex.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.617
It could be months
before there's another.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.751
What? Wait a minute

04:11.818 --> 04:13.152
This is New York City.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.988
There's an endless supply of men here.

04:15.254 --> 04:16.356
I took a pledge.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.257
- Okay.
- Yeah, starting tomorrow,

04:19.025 --> 04:20.927
no more auditioning boys in my bed.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.430
- I signed with a professional matchmaker.
- A matchmaker?

04:24.998 --> 04:27.233
Was this one
of your white friends' suggestions?

04:27.300 --> 04:28.468
Molly, wasn't it?

04:28.534 --> 04:32.005
She caters to diverse professional women
like me.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.806
How is it different from a dating app?

04:33.873 --> 04:35.274
- It cost 20 grand.
- What?

04:35.341 --> 04:37.176
Who the hell is she introducing you to?

04:37.243 --> 04:38.645
Is Barack leaving Michelle?

04:39.145 --> 04:41.848
So, tonight's about getting your freak
out of your system?

04:41.914 --> 04:44.517
The last casual encounter
before my husband comes.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.487
If you don't find your husband,
at least you've had a few laughs.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.090
- Off the charts in bed, I'm sure.
- Hi.

04:51.724 --> 04:52.992
You're Mary Jane Paul, right?

04:53.292 --> 04:54.827
- Yeah.
- Can I buy you a drink?

04:55.194 --> 04:58.097
You know, this is more
like a girl's night thing.

04:58.164 --> 04:59.465
- Some other time then.
- Sure.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.268
I know I'm buzzed, but that boy was fine.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.671
And he also knew my name and who I was.

05:04.737 --> 05:05.805
So what?

05:05.872 --> 05:08.107
So I didn't bring
any non-disclosure agreements

05:08.174 --> 05:10.610
and I don't want to be accountable
for my actions tonight.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.478
You are so damn scandalous.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.548
This guy.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.117
Don't look now,

05:18.184 --> 05:20.353
but I'm not the only
with a potential for a scandal.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.723
Don't temp me. I'm drunk enough
to not give a damn.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.059
Go. He is primed and ready.

05:26.125 --> 05:29.262
You'll have to get him home to his mom
before the street lights come on,

05:29.328 --> 05:30.496
but he's good to go.

05:30.563 --> 05:31.531
All right.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.067
I will see you "mañana."

05:34.667 --> 05:35.735
That's my girl.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.003
Bright and early.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.474
It's like the pub, back home in London.

05:50.783 --> 05:51.951
Thank you.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.628
Hello.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.931
Did I overhear you saying
that you are from the UK?

06:05.531 --> 06:06.566
Yeah. London.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.234
Primrose Hill area.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.104
I got here three weeks ago.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.739
I'm...

06:14.407 --> 06:15.675
No names?

06:16.342 --> 06:18.177
No, I like to keep things mysterious.

06:20.346 --> 06:21.314
Are you a fugitive?

06:22.815 --> 06:23.950
You're not a wanted woman?

06:25.418 --> 06:26.385
Okay.

06:27.453 --> 06:30.356
No. I'm just searching
for a little escape

06:30.623 --> 06:32.325
before reality bites me in the morning.

06:33.793 --> 06:34.761
So,

06:35.695 --> 06:36.696
London,

06:37.897 --> 06:38.865
are you in?

06:44.837 --> 06:46.472
Can you give me just one minute?

06:52.278 --> 06:53.613
Okay.

06:54.013 --> 06:55.081
Kara.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.485
<i>- Okay.
- It's Kara.</i>

06:59.552 --> 07:01.454
<i>- Leave a message.
- Kara, hey. It's MJ.</i>

07:02.455 --> 07:05.458
I know my plan sounded really great
in theory, but...

07:06.359 --> 07:09.262
There's a strange man with a hard-on
in my hotel room right now.

07:09.695 --> 07:10.730
It's crazy, right?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.637
Look. If I happen to die tonight,
just know

07:19.005 --> 07:21.007
I made it a point of walking him past

07:21.874 --> 07:23.042
the security cameras.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.711
Pray for me.

07:33.052 --> 07:33.986
There she is.

07:42.662 --> 07:43.729
Everything okay?

07:44.997 --> 07:46.032
Fine.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.267
Can I fix you a drink?

07:49.535 --> 07:50.636
I've already had a couple,

07:51.537 --> 07:54.106
but you can slip this on.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.944
- On?
- Your wrist.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.014
Thought I'd be slipping
on something else.

08:02.381 --> 08:03.416
I have that too,

08:03.883 --> 08:05.318
but we're gonna start here.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.352
So,

08:07.253 --> 08:09.222
- when I want more...
- More?

08:11.791 --> 08:12.725
Faster.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.295
Harder.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.030
Take your clothes off.

08:38.784 --> 08:39.852
Is this not what you want?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.588
- I can stop.
- No.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.056
Don't.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.492
I can't carry on unless you tell me to.

08:48.828 --> 08:49.929
Damn it. I had a plan,

08:52.198 --> 08:53.966
fantasy I've been imagining.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.437
Probably got the idea from some movie
I saw in the '80s.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.672
What is it?

09:01.340 --> 09:02.575
I don't think I want that.

09:04.844 --> 09:05.811
What do you want?

09:12.184 --> 09:13.252
I'm just here for you.

09:13.953 --> 09:14.921
Okay?

09:15.521 --> 09:16.689
Tell me what you want.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.561
Tell me you love me.

09:32.672 --> 09:33.639
I love you.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.686
<i>Anybody have eyes on Mary Jane?
I need her out here.</i>

10:21.087 --> 10:22.021
<i>Anybody?</i>

10:26.759 --> 10:28.361
Mary Jane! Mary Jane.

10:28.627 --> 10:31.731
Good morning, momma. Come on!
Keep up. Let's go.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.899
We're gonna start with the fans outside.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.435
The floor manager's
got the whole thing going.

10:36.502 --> 10:38.170
I'll be right there. Just a minute.

10:38.237 --> 10:39.939
Ronda and Aaron are on their way in.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.275
Isn't this beautiful?
That is your future, right there.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.011
That's gonna be your desk. You hear me?

10:45.344 --> 10:47.213
I need the mic for Mary Jane, please.

10:47.513 --> 10:49.815
Let's get moving here. Thank you.
Give me that mic.

10:49.882 --> 10:50.983
Thank you. You okay?

10:51.250 --> 10:52.518
Talk to me. What's wrong?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.588
What's the matter?

10:55.654 --> 10:56.822
- Kara...
- What?

10:58.524 --> 10:59.792
There's something I...

11:01.060 --> 11:03.062
I haven't told anyone. Not even you.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.631
I tried to tell you last night
but it just...

11:06.499 --> 11:07.800
Okay. What?

11:08.067 --> 11:09.301
When I left SNC,

11:10.669 --> 11:12.004
It wasn't because I wanted to.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.440
I mean, they let me resign, but really,

11:15.608 --> 11:16.876
they fired my ass.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.211
Because of the Niecy stuff?

11:19.578 --> 11:22.214
I knew defending her
was ruffling feathers,

11:23.449 --> 11:26.352
but when I started really railing
about police brutality

11:26.419 --> 11:27.987
and racial profiling, it was...

11:28.054 --> 11:31.590
The only difference between you and me
is I left before I got to that, OK?

11:31.991 --> 11:33.292
But you're here now.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.828
That last time I was on camera,

11:36.695 --> 11:37.997
it felt like it was...

11:38.631 --> 11:40.266
That was it. Like I was done.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.868
MJ, the forced cheerfulness of morning TV

11:42.935 --> 11:44.503
is gonna strangle all those doubts.

11:45.304 --> 11:46.305
Okay?

11:47.406 --> 11:48.808
I know this is cheesy,

11:50.509 --> 11:53.045
but that is the job I wanted
when I graduated college.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.280
That!

11:54.914 --> 11:56.315
You got this. Okay?

11:56.615 --> 11:58.150
- I got this.
- You got this, trust me.

11:58.484 --> 11:59.919
Take this mic, OK?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.921
Ready? Let's go.

12:13.732 --> 12:17.136
Live from New York City,
this is "Great Day USA,"

12:17.203 --> 12:18.704
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

12:23.709 --> 12:24.977
- It's cold.
- Yes, I know.

12:25.044 --> 12:26.345
- Here.
- Thank you.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.684
I'd say you'll get used to it,
but I never did and I grew up here.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.018
The Cory Booker interview.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.421
Do you think it's possible
to get anything done in Washington?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.922
Absolutely. Bipartisanship...

12:37.690 --> 12:40.426
She's about to hit him
with the Ronda Sales surprise question.

12:41.961 --> 12:43.329
There she goes.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.531
Wait for it.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.634
She's gonna lean in.

12:50.302 --> 12:51.604
How did you know that?

12:52.404 --> 12:54.940
I spent the better part
of my first on-air job

12:55.407 --> 12:56.408
trying to imitate her.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.947
Recorded all of her news cast,
studied her delivery.

13:02.681 --> 13:05.784
I might've used a couple of her
tricks when I interviewed for this job.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.020
It worked. They'll groom you for her job.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.155
Come on, let's go near.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.925
<i>Nothing worthwhile is easy.
Sure there's challenges...</i>

13:13.726 --> 13:15.361
Mary Jane, welcome to the show.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.530
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Of course.

13:18.597 --> 13:19.865
- Look at her.
- Hello?

13:20.166 --> 13:21.734
Yes. Excuse me.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.536
<i>You're a progressive champion,</i>

13:23.602 --> 13:26.906
but you work alongside conservatives
like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.543
I can't imagine it always being easy
to find common ground.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.312
No, it's not easy,
but nothing worthwhile is easy.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.981
<i>- He's stone-walling.
- It's necessary to the work I do.</i>

13:37.783 --> 13:40.719
Tell her to ask him
about his school expulsions bill.

13:41.453 --> 13:42.588
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.089
- Do it. Trust me.
- Okay.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.927
Ronda, ask him
about his school expulsions bill.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.562
Okay. Then tell me this.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.797
Your school expulsions bill,

13:51.864 --> 13:54.066
is that an example of those challenges?

13:56.235 --> 14:00.072
Look, the Supportive School Climate Act
is an important bill

14:00.139 --> 14:02.041
<i>because kids are being expelled...</i>

14:02.107 --> 14:03.776
That was a good got-you moment.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.444
<i>What most people don't know</i>

14:05.744 --> 14:08.347
is a black kid and a white kid,
for the same infraction,

14:08.647 --> 14:11.717
the data shows the black
is more likely to be expelled

14:11.784 --> 14:13.719
- or get a more serious punishment.
- Right.

14:13.786 --> 14:16.589
Data also shows that doing
the same crime, black and white,

14:16.655 --> 14:18.991
the black person is gonna get
the longer sentence.

14:19.058 --> 14:22.728
And this makes for higher rates
of black incarceration in our country.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.096
How high is higher?

14:24.163 --> 14:25.798
Here we are in 2017.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.702
There are more African-Americans
under criminal supervision now

14:29.768 --> 14:31.470
than all the slaves in 1850.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.605
That's a scandal.

14:32.671 --> 14:35.174
We say we're a country of liberty
and justice for all.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.476
This is an injustice and it must stop.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.414
Ronda, nice job.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.883
Thank you. Kara, great feed.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.619
I have to ask, how did you know that?

14:46.919 --> 14:49.655
Actually,
that was Ms. Mary Jane Paul's idea.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.791
I've been wanting to interview him
for the longest time.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.394
I just researched like 12 layers deep.

14:56.295 --> 14:57.529
Our new correspondent.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.398
Great way to get acquainted.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.033
God, the pleasure is all mine.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.702
Sometimes it's tough
to find a connection with a subject,

15:03.769 --> 15:05.104
but you made that possible.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.273
- Happy to help.
- That's my girl.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.376
Mary Jane, you got to get touched up.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.278
- You're gonna get back on soon.
- Right.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.046
Who do they have doing her? Becky?

15:14.380 --> 15:15.447
Yeah. I think so.

15:16.548 --> 15:18.717
Becky is well meaning,
but you'll want Ty.

15:19.184 --> 15:20.886
Ty is my personal stylist.

15:21.287 --> 15:24.023
And we agreed he must do your hair too.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.725
- Thank you.
- Welcome to the show.

15:27.126 --> 15:28.260
Follow me to my lair.

15:28.327 --> 15:30.029
- Thank you, Ty.
- Take good care of her.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.097
All right.

15:32.564 --> 15:33.966
Ronda, do you have a minute?

15:34.033 --> 15:37.636
I wanna go over some ideas I have
for the Supreme Court Justice story.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.938
You should just talk to Garrett

15:40.239 --> 15:42.141
I've tried to talk to Garrett,

15:42.207 --> 15:44.343
but it's kind of hard to get in his ear.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.844
Doesn't surprise me.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.579
Still can't believe the network

15:48.113 --> 15:49.948
hired a toddler to run the show.

15:50.015 --> 15:51.517
Rick Greg's older than Garret.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.385
Will you talk to him?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.554
I'm not certain
I'm gonna cover the story.

15:56.088 --> 15:57.823
But Garrett said all hands on deck.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.558
Garrett says a lot of things.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.828
Nice work with Cory Booker.

16:03.762 --> 16:06.598
And great job getting on Ronda's
good side on your first day.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.002
Of course, now you got to interview
that hip hop artist.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.271
I know, It's not gonna mean Peab parties.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.139
Welcome to morning TV.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.408
And we're back with "Great Day USA."

16:16.709 --> 16:19.111
We're checking in
on those New Year's resolutions.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.680
A few weeks in. How are we all doing?

16:21.947 --> 16:23.549
<i>How many of us started a diet?</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:26.085
Patrick, there she is! Come on!

16:27.853 --> 16:29.488
She looks cold, baby.

16:29.555 --> 16:32.658
Of course she looks cold.
It's wintertime in New York City.

16:33.926 --> 16:34.960
<i>And back to the studio.</i>

16:35.561 --> 16:36.795
She's gone again.

16:37.062 --> 16:39.598
Patrick, what are you doing?
You missed her.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.835
The press wants a statement from Niecy
about the cop returning to work.

16:42.901 --> 16:46.705
- I'm trying to get it together.
- Niecy should write her own statement.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.474
Mary Jane always did it for her, ma.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.611
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

16:52.978 --> 16:53.946
Put this on, baby.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.414
Niecy.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.617
Niecy, can you read this?

16:58.684 --> 17:00.352
My hands are kind of full right now.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.520
This is important.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.589
I don't wanna talk about that now.

17:04.490 --> 17:06.058
I'll see you guys later, come on.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.961
- Say bye.
- Bye.

17:09.027 --> 17:10.062
See you, little man.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.631
- Bye, dad. See you later.
- All right, darling.

17:18.904 --> 17:21.540
At the top of the hour,
we've got a surprise hip hop artist

17:21.907 --> 17:24.843
who'll be dazzling the crowd
with one of his hit singles.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.378
Okay, guys. Looking good.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.747
Everything looks real good.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.520
I understand everyone here
is celebrating a birthday today.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.854
Am I right?

17:35.921 --> 17:37.790
We have someone for you to talk to.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.392
It's the guy on the left
with the broad shoulders.

17:40.726 --> 17:41.727
We all like him.

17:43.862 --> 17:46.098
Women are 72 percent of our audience.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.467
Birthday!

17:49.301 --> 17:50.903
Yes! Happy birthday!

17:51.703 --> 17:56.041
So, all of these strangers here
have one thing in common.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.277
They're all born on the same day.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.379
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

18:01.680 --> 18:03.048
Some people call me London,

18:03.348 --> 18:04.383
but my name is Lee.

18:04.817 --> 18:05.784
Lee Truitt.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.221
Is it really your birthday
or did you just wanna be on camera?

18:09.688 --> 18:11.957
It feels like my birthday
standing here with you.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.528
<i>- And how old are we turning today?
- I love it.</i>

18:16.595 --> 18:19.665
Too old to know anything
about your surprise hip hop act,

18:19.731 --> 18:21.500
but I'm gonna stick around and listen.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.236
My goodness! How adorable is he?

18:24.303 --> 18:27.272
So, to all our birthday boys
and girls here and out there,

18:28.340 --> 18:29.308
happy birthday.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.743
More to come on "Great Day USA."

18:33.579 --> 18:35.814
- So like a take shot and...
- Hey.

18:36.849 --> 18:37.816
Mary Jane.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.653
- Hey.
- I didn't wanna turn out like this,

18:42.688 --> 18:44.356
- but I was compelled to.
- Compelled?

18:44.723 --> 18:47.759
I don't usually wake up this early,
but for some reason today I did.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.928
If I wake up early,
I'm not gonna watch TV,

18:50.329 --> 18:51.463
but today I turned it on.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.666
If I turned on the TV,
I wouldn't watch this show.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.134
But there you were.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.439
A lot of coincidences just to get me
to see your face on a TV screen.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.409
I probably should've been
a little more clear.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.980
See, last night was supposed to be
like a photo on Snapchat.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.883
We have a moment and then it's gone.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.319
- You don't wanna see me?
- No. Absolutely not.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.755
- There'll be no repeat performance.
- Okay.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.790
Let me take your number,
in case you change your mind.

19:18.857 --> 19:19.791
I won't.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.094
I gotta get back to work.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.797
Look at you.

19:26.064 --> 19:29.601
Two minutes in New York and you already
got the men crawling out of the woodwork.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.602
That was him, Kara.

19:31.036 --> 19:32.871
The one I told you about from last night.

19:32.938 --> 19:34.773
The Brit guy you took to the hotel?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.074
- What?
- Yes.

19:37.376 --> 19:38.810
- Are you gonna see him again?
- No!

19:39.211 --> 19:40.879
- Why?
- Absolutely not.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.214
That was the old Mary Jane.

19:42.281 --> 19:43.248
The new Mary Jane,

19:43.649 --> 19:47.085
well, she got a 20,000 dollars matchmaker
to search for a husband.

19:47.619 --> 19:50.255
Know what? Do you really need
a 20,000 dollars matchmaker?

19:50.322 --> 19:52.224
He's got a lot of potential. He's hot.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.727
- You already know he's good in bed.
- I thought you support me in this.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.229
I am supporting you in this.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.731
- Here you are. We're ready for you.
- Thank you.

19:59.798 --> 20:02.434
I know this job is supposed
to be my primary focus,

20:03.168 --> 20:05.270
but I can't help feeling like hurdling

20:05.337 --> 20:07.706
towards the title of, like, news widow.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.442
Being anchor was supposed to be
part of the picture,

20:10.509 --> 20:14.479
and I think it's time
to sort of complete the full picture.

20:15.847 --> 20:17.549
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, I am.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.918
Listen, do what you want
with your matchmaker,

20:19.985 --> 20:21.820
spend 30,000 dollars on her if you want.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.324
All I'm saying is I better have
a wedding invitation this time next year.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.559
- Here you go.
- From your lips to God's ears.

20:29.227 --> 20:30.195
Yeah.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.665
Said hip hop artist likes and dislikes.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.601
Lemon pepper wings or barbecue?

20:36.468 --> 20:38.570
I'm over it, Dante, it's a circus.

20:38.637 --> 20:41.473
Everyone in my family wants me
to talk about what happened again.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.209
That cop going back to work
is all over the news now,

20:44.776 --> 20:45.978
but it's gonna die down.

20:46.244 --> 20:49.214
Protests are being played,
that's gonna put it out there even more.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.150
Treyvion's having nightmares.
It's a mess.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.653
- I'm ready for it to be over.
- It will be.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.289
You're getting that lawsuit money.

20:58.857 --> 20:59.925
Yeah.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.760
Once you get that paper, you'll be good.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.765
Ty. Ty!

21:07.132 --> 21:08.200
Listen.

21:08.266 --> 21:11.536
Is something up with Ronda?

21:11.603 --> 21:15.073
She's being really cagey about covering
the Supreme Court Justice story.

21:15.140 --> 21:17.809
We have more than one anchor here.
Maybe Aaron's on it.

21:18.076 --> 21:21.279
Yeah, but Ronda will be all over that.
It's a big story.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.716
All right, what's it gonna take?

21:24.783 --> 21:26.284
How about tickets to Fashion Week?

21:26.785 --> 21:28.687
First row, Kanye West collection.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.056
Come on! Wait a minute.

21:31.423 --> 21:33.125
What about a travel assignment?

21:33.592 --> 21:36.928
Miami South Beach Food And Wine Festival

21:37.529 --> 21:38.897
in February

21:39.164 --> 21:41.767
- I'm listening.
- And your husband can come, too.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.503
Yes? Yes!

21:50.842 --> 21:54.046
Ronda's acting coy 'cause she don't know
if she gonna be working here.

21:54.112 --> 21:55.247
What?

21:55.313 --> 21:58.283
She just signed a multi-huge contract
with Katie Couric money.

21:58.350 --> 21:59.584
The deal didn't close.

22:02.921 --> 22:06.758
So that means Garrick could be looking
to replace Ronda sooner than later.

22:07.526 --> 22:08.560
It's risky as hell,

22:08.827 --> 22:11.663
but this place could use a fresh face,
don't you think?

22:47.899 --> 22:51.169
Mary Jane, this is his first time
on a big morning show.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.271
He's not used
into this kind of spotlight.

22:53.572 --> 22:55.307
- Dave East.
- How you doing?

22:55.373 --> 22:58.210
Thank you for coming on this show.
Amazing performance.

22:58.276 --> 23:01.113
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- You just got signed to Def Jam.

23:01.179 --> 23:03.615
You got collaborations
with the hottest names in music.

23:03.949 --> 23:05.884
- This is a dream!
- It is dope.

23:06.651 --> 23:09.254
- Yeah.
- Do whatever you can do to draw him out.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.256
<i>A lot of our viewers don't know</i>

23:11.323 --> 23:14.192
you had a big basketball career
throughout college.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.895
Yeah, but it was just at that age,
18 to 21,

23:16.962 --> 23:19.364
I couldn't be coached or talked to.

23:19.431 --> 23:20.832
I had a hot temper.

23:20.899 --> 23:23.135
My life had to make a big transition

23:23.201 --> 23:26.671
from me doing that to that not working.
And then get into the music.

23:26.938 --> 23:29.708
- So hip-hop was your saving grace?
- Yeah, it definitely was.

23:29.775 --> 23:33.178
- You're also a new father?
- Yeah, I just had my daughter, Karisha.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.348
What of your life experiences
go into your lyrics?

23:36.648 --> 23:41.653
Everything I talk about is something
I'm aspiring to do or I've done.

23:41.953 --> 23:44.823
Do you ever rap about your relationships?

23:45.891 --> 23:48.293
Some of them.
I'm not gonna say they shaped me,

23:48.360 --> 23:50.195
but my experiences with women

23:50.262 --> 23:52.130
<i>definitely matured my thought process</i>

23:52.197 --> 23:53.598
and how to deal with women today.

23:53.899 --> 23:56.968
Is there a woman that's shaping you now?

23:57.269 --> 24:00.005
Yes! She's going in for the kill.
That's my girl.

24:00.071 --> 24:01.573
<i>My daughter's shaping me, but...</i>

24:02.174 --> 24:04.910
With the new baby, women wanna know
if he's off the market.

24:04.976 --> 24:07.212
<i>Our female audience is dying to know.</i>

24:07.479 --> 24:09.848
<i>They will get me in trouble,
even talking about this</i>

24:09.915 --> 24:11.449
but I'm single.

24:11.516 --> 24:12.751
<i>- Yes!
- You're single?</i>

24:12.818 --> 24:13.785
<i>Yeah, I'm single.</i>

24:14.386 --> 24:16.388
But I'm not really like on a hunt.

24:16.454 --> 24:20.192
I'm more focused on my daughter,
my music, my family,

24:20.258 --> 24:22.561
and where I gonna be
in the next five to ten years.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.563
That's my main focus.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.399
But I'm always down for conversation

24:27.465 --> 24:29.734
or a good movie or dinner,
that's cool with me.

24:30.068 --> 24:31.636
So you're open to dating.

24:32.671 --> 24:35.373
- This is news.
- I didn't say that, you said that.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.742
You said that! Conversation, dinner...

24:37.809 --> 24:39.110
That sounds like a date to me.

24:40.078 --> 24:41.046
<i>Yes!</i>

24:42.180 --> 24:43.481
Take that, TMZ!

24:44.015 --> 24:46.384
We'll be right back with more
from "Great Day USA."

24:47.686 --> 24:48.653
I love it!

24:51.156 --> 24:52.123
Yes!

24:53.425 --> 24:56.061
You know what, people?
It's not curing cancer,

24:56.328 --> 24:57.929
but we did scoop the tabloids.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.066
And in our world,
that is worth something!

25:01.333 --> 25:02.300
Fist pump.

25:02.701 --> 25:03.768
Nice interview.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.771
Hip-hop's not my thing,
but you had some pretty slick moves.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.939
Thanks, Aaron.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.208
That's a huge compliment coming from you.

25:10.275 --> 25:13.545
I'm Natalie. Some of the correspondents
and I are having some drinks later.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.213
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah, thanks.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.414
- Great.
- See you tonight.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.284
Mary Jane, is she liking New York?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.620
Yeah, she loves it actually.

25:23.955 --> 25:25.023
Why do you ask?

25:30.228 --> 25:31.630
- I did all right there.
- Yeah.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.798
My cheeks hurt from all the smiling
I had to do.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.100
Listen to me.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.402
- You see that poster there?
- Yeah, who's that?

25:37.469 --> 25:38.637
That could be your face.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.472
- That's why I'm here.
- No. Listen.

25:43.508 --> 25:45.810
I'm not talking about in two years,

25:46.077 --> 25:47.512
I'm talking about right now.

25:48.146 --> 25:49.214
I'm serious.

25:49.281 --> 25:53.118
Ty told me that Ronda
has been fielding offers.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.857
- She's leaving the show? When?
- Listen to me.

26:00.892 --> 26:04.729
She's not even committing to a story
a month from now, Mary Jane.

26:05.196 --> 26:06.765
I want you to focus. Listen.

26:06.831 --> 26:09.868
Garret wants to take you to lunch
to talk about your future on this show.

26:09.935 --> 26:11.703
- Okay.
- If you play your cards right,

26:12.003 --> 26:14.172
you can be in that anchor chair
by spring.

26:18.443 --> 26:19.711
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.613
Natalie invited us out for drinks,
you coming?

26:21.680 --> 26:22.747
No.

26:22.814 --> 26:24.816
Another frat boy charged with rape.

26:24.883 --> 26:26.718
I have to prepare package for tomorrow.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.354
I thought you were going to Atlanta
and see the kids tomorrow.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.691
No. I'll have to make it up
to them some other time, hopefully.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.792
Go, have fun.

26:34.459 --> 26:36.628
- Hey, Mary Jane?
- Yes.

26:36.928 --> 26:37.896
This came for you,

26:38.263 --> 26:39.531
from a guy named Lee.

26:40.365 --> 26:41.399
Thanks.

27:04.522 --> 27:05.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:06.858 --> 27:07.926
You missed your dinner.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.396
Yeah, sorry,
I just needed to clear my head.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.098
Good night.

27:13.531 --> 27:14.766
I finished the statement.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.469
Wanna hear it?

27:17.535 --> 27:19.471
I don't wanna keep reliving
getting tased.

27:20.171 --> 27:21.973
My son relives it every night, so.

27:22.407 --> 27:23.375
Niecy,

27:23.675 --> 27:24.642
sit down.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.411
You need to hear this.

27:39.290 --> 27:40.425
"As a black man,

27:41.126 --> 27:44.362
I've been stopped by the cops
countless times for no reason,

27:44.763 --> 27:46.898
but I knew the rules
and learned the drill.

27:49.367 --> 27:51.770
I never imagined my daughter,
my little girl,

27:52.103 --> 27:53.838
would have to go through the same thing.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.043
Almost every week, there's a story
about an unarmed black man

27:58.109 --> 27:59.844
being shot and killed by the police.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.415
But we don't realize it can happen
to our young women as well.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.417
Nobody in our community is safe.

28:06.684 --> 28:08.053
What happened to her that day

28:08.119 --> 28:10.388
was a first of many attacks
on our family.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.858
Afterwards, when we sought justice,
we were put on trial.

28:13.925 --> 28:16.494
Our name was scrutinized
and dragged through the mud.

28:16.561 --> 28:18.196
It was an assault on all of us.

28:18.963 --> 28:20.532
And I was to blame for a lot of it.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.070
I haven't been exactly been
a model son or father.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.305
Drug abuse,

28:27.672 --> 28:28.840
broken promises,

28:29.507 --> 28:31.042
my past hasn't always been pretty.

28:33.078 --> 28:34.312
When the incident happened,

28:34.612 --> 28:36.281
my father wasn't even talking to me.

28:37.816 --> 28:39.951
My whole family was fractured
and in disarray.

28:41.119 --> 28:44.456
But the amazing thing is
all the vicious attacks and scrutiny

28:44.956 --> 28:46.991
forced our family
to stop fighting each other.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.762
This tragedy showed us
that we're stronger together.

28:51.196 --> 28:52.497
And this goes for all of us.

28:53.598 --> 28:57.302
As a community, we have to be
a united front in the face of injustice

28:57.368 --> 28:59.137
if we ever want things to change."

29:04.542 --> 29:05.743
That was beautiful, son.

29:12.884 --> 29:14.886
Pauletta couldn't have said it better.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.962
I got the impression they were
fairly democratic,

29:24.028 --> 29:25.363
right? The story meetings?

29:25.430 --> 29:28.133
Ronda gets the first pick
on most stories, interviews too.

29:28.199 --> 29:31.202
But if it's foreign affairs or sports,
Aaron usually steps in.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.770
He's a man's man.

29:33.071 --> 29:35.440
Right, a man's man. He's gay, right?

29:35.507 --> 29:36.641
- Gay?
- Yeah.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.176
My God, no.

29:38.543 --> 29:41.346
When I first got here,
we had one drunken night.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.014
Too much tequila.

29:43.381 --> 29:46.117
Thought it'd be fun to see
what his bedroom ceiling looked like.

29:46.417 --> 29:47.418
And?

29:48.153 --> 29:50.388
Let's say that thing
about workplace romance,

29:50.455 --> 29:52.924
sometimes the most boring clichés
turn out to be true.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.426
But where else are we gonna meet people?

29:56.394 --> 29:58.062
You are a great interviewer.

29:58.396 --> 29:59.731
You heard my whole life story.

30:01.733 --> 30:02.934
This is perfect. Thank you.

30:04.502 --> 30:05.904
<i>- Hello.?
- Mary Jane?</i>

30:05.970 --> 30:07.572
<i>Felicia Batie, the matchmaker here.</i>

30:08.373 --> 30:10.608
Hi. Just a second.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.344
Yeah.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.948
I've just emailed you my self-assessment
and my dating criteria.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.917
Yes, I got everything.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.618
Listen, Mary Jane,

30:20.985 --> 30:22.987
I don't think
I can work with you after all.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.255
What?

30:24.589 --> 30:26.658
Wait. No. Why?

30:27.926 --> 30:29.928
I signed a contract. You cashed my check.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.229
You'll get a full refund.

30:31.529 --> 30:33.765
<i>No. Honestly, I don't want a refund.</i>

30:33.831 --> 30:34.933
I want your help.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.469
Look, in my line of work,
when I see red flags,

30:38.736 --> 30:40.238
<i>it's unwise for me to ignore them.</i>

30:40.505 --> 30:41.806
I'm so confused.

30:41.873 --> 30:42.907
What red flag?

30:44.209 --> 30:47.512
You got some blind spots
when it comes to self-knowledge.

30:49.013 --> 30:52.183
Maybe I rushed through the assessments,

30:52.617 --> 30:53.718
but I've been busy.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.621
I started a new job.
You know that. I told you.

30:56.921 --> 31:00.158
Yeah. I got enough to get a true sense
of what's going on.

31:00.825 --> 31:02.026
Bottom line is,

31:02.493 --> 31:03.661
for this to work,

31:04.262 --> 31:06.264
it requires more
than just writing a check.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.866
<i>You've got work to do on yourself.</i>

31:09.634 --> 31:10.802
Are you breaking up with me?

31:11.402 --> 31:13.071
I do sincerely hope you find love.

31:13.805 --> 31:14.772
Best of luck.

31:39.764 --> 31:43.067
Pop music used to be
so lovely and poetic.

31:43.468 --> 31:46.704
But there's no more metaphor in music,
because you, America,

31:47.105 --> 31:48.106
killed it.

31:48.373 --> 31:51.175
No, I'm being serious.
Take Ariana Grande for example.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.012
She's this beautiful,
cute Disney princess.

31:54.312 --> 31:57.749
She sings this ballad with The Weeknd,
called "Love Me Harder."

31:58.116 --> 32:00.385
Now, in this beautiful ballad,

32:00.451 --> 32:02.754
you think it was
this female empowerment anthem

32:02.820 --> 32:04.555
where she's pleading to her partner

32:04.822 --> 32:07.492
to open up his heart and love her more.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.061
No. No!

32:10.361 --> 32:14.565
She's literally asking him
to pound her harder.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.936
I've been Lee Truitt,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:19.003 --> 32:21.172
You've been great. Thank you.
See you next time.

32:27.979 --> 32:30.348
Let's hear it one more time
for Lee Truitt!

32:31.115 --> 32:32.083
Lee Truitt!

32:32.950 --> 32:34.218
Were the jokes that bad?

32:34.819 --> 32:37.755
No, quite the opposite actually.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.725
I honestly wasn't expecting you
to show tonight.

32:40.992 --> 32:44.128
- I honestly wasn't gonna come.
- What made you change your mind?

32:44.195 --> 32:48.099
My previous plans sort of went to hell
in a handbasket and I thought, why not?

32:49.534 --> 32:52.370
- But I really wasn't expecting...
- What?

32:53.104 --> 32:54.939
Me to be more handsome than you remember?

32:55.606 --> 32:56.874
Such complexity.

32:57.909 --> 32:58.910
Is that a bad thing?

33:00.078 --> 33:01.079
No.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.818
Makes me wish
we could have started with...

33:07.318 --> 33:08.286
I don't know...

33:08.586 --> 33:10.922
- Names being exchanged first.
- We still can.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.258
Consider this a do-over.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.168
Lee Truitt, nice to meet you.

33:25.536 --> 33:26.604
Mary Jane Paul.

33:28.773 --> 33:29.941
Listen, Mary Jane Paul,

33:30.842 --> 33:33.711
there is a nice, quiet bar
just around the corner.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.614
What d'you say we check it out?

33:37.482 --> 33:39.283
I don't normally take home strange men.

33:40.551 --> 33:41.853
What d'you normally do?

33:41.919 --> 33:43.354
I Google them

33:43.421 --> 33:45.289
and then we go out
on a date and I pretend

33:45.356 --> 33:47.392
I haven't seen
every last one of their posts.

33:47.992 --> 33:51.429
You should know I don't normally go home
with strange women either.

33:51.796 --> 33:52.897
So why did you?

33:53.598 --> 33:55.433
I'm a sucker for a damsel in distress.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.302
You think I was in distress?

33:59.937 --> 34:00.872
Weren't you?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.879
Looks like there's a party
starting without us. Come on!

34:10.648 --> 34:12.517
This is a little livelier
than I had in mind.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.386
You can dance, can't you?

34:16.354 --> 34:17.922
You watch me dance.

35:52.149 --> 35:54.552
<i>Later, we've got the psychic
who correctly predicted</i>

35:54.619 --> 35:56.220
last year's election results

35:56.287 --> 35:59.223
here, making some bold predictions
for 2017.

35:59.524 --> 36:02.360
Stay tuned for that and more.
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.262
What do you think of the link I sent you?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.297
Could be good
for a personal finance story.

36:06.864 --> 36:07.832
Where you going?

36:08.633 --> 36:11.102
- My lunch with Garrett.
- Right.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.170
You got this, remember that.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.239
Come on, rock it out!

36:16.908 --> 36:18.175
Find me when you get back.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.048
Mary Jane!

36:25.316 --> 36:26.384
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:27.184 --> 36:29.720
- Thanks for joining me today.
- No. My pleasure.

36:31.088 --> 36:32.223
Right.

36:32.757 --> 36:34.892
- Good to see you. Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

36:35.192 --> 36:38.763
So, how's New York treating you so far?

36:38.829 --> 36:40.131
- Great!
- Yeah?

36:40.197 --> 36:41.732
- Yeah, no complaints.
- Good.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.302
<i>Mary Jane, let's cut to the chase.</i>

36:44.602 --> 36:46.704
<i>It's no secret why we brought you here.</i>

36:46.771 --> 36:49.106
<i>So let's talk about the next steps.</i>

36:54.645 --> 36:55.613
How did it go?

36:57.181 --> 37:00.084
You're looking at the newest anchor
of "Great Day USA."

37:00.685 --> 37:01.719
That well?

37:02.119 --> 37:04.655
I'm pretty sure Garret's
talking to my agent as we speak.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.859
I told you this move to New York
would be great for us.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.263
Once I'm in the anchor chair,
it's just a matter of time

37:12.330 --> 37:14.632
- to move Garrett out of that office.
- Yes!

37:16.434 --> 37:18.669
Mary Jane, can I have a word with you?

37:18.736 --> 37:19.704
Of course.

37:20.771 --> 37:21.739
Come on in.

37:24.775 --> 37:26.410
I like you Mary Jane, I do.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.547
That is why I'm gonna be frank.

37:30.448 --> 37:31.716
Garrett

37:32.950 --> 37:35.152
has no intention of making you co-anchor.

37:35.987 --> 37:36.921
Excuse me?

37:37.355 --> 37:41.592
I know It probably seems he is,
given what transpired at Mary Shelley's.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.362
It was Mary Shelley's, wasn't it?

37:45.429 --> 37:46.664
Of course it was.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.568
Garrett's favorite booth in the back,
against the wall.

37:50.635 --> 37:51.602
Bottle of Pinot.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.170
Dessert.

37:54.138 --> 37:57.541
I feel the seduction started weeks ago,
when you were being interviewed.

37:58.075 --> 38:01.479
Undoubtedly, he led you to believe
you'd been groomed for my spot.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.681
He alluded to that, yeah.

38:04.582 --> 38:08.686
And now he makes it seem
that my departure is imminent.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.022
You're not fielding other offers?

38:11.589 --> 38:12.723
This is my home.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.828
So why am I being led to believe
I have a future here if I don't?

38:18.663 --> 38:20.598
Garrett tried to pit us
against each other.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.401
He's the EP, why would he do that?

38:24.769 --> 38:27.838
Telegenic rivalry
between two black women?

38:28.406 --> 38:29.674
Try to sway things.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.143
It's morning news, not a reality TV show.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.046
It's all about reality TV nowadays.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.649
I know you don't believe me.

38:39.283 --> 38:40.551
But you'll soon see I'm right.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.120
So this is all just a ploy?

38:43.954 --> 38:45.456
An act to get the rivalry going?

38:45.756 --> 38:49.593
Once sweeps are over with
and my contract gets renewed,

38:50.294 --> 38:52.730
I'll be in the anchor chair
for another five years.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.299
You'll be outside that glass

38:55.866 --> 38:56.901
in the middle of winter.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.611
- Mary Jane! Everything okay?
- Yeah. I just wanna give you a head's up.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.780
My agent is really excited
to talk to you.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.248
Yeah, I am too. So excited.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.650
There's just...

39:13.150 --> 39:14.452
I should've seen it coming.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.954
Business affairs is advising me
to slow things down.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.056
- Really?
- They wanna wait until you're out

39:19.123 --> 39:21.225
of your probationary period
on your contract.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.960
Which is totally understandable.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.795
- Of course.
- But not to worry.

39:25.062 --> 39:26.897
The offer will come, in time.

39:27.665 --> 39:28.632
Okay.

39:39.643 --> 39:42.379
Kara, they had no intention
of ever grooming me to be anchor.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.749
<i>Don't get your suitcase out just yet.</i>

39:44.815 --> 39:46.150
<i>Let's at least sleep on it.</i>

39:47.284 --> 39:48.252
<i>MJ?</i>

39:48.586 --> 39:50.054
<i>- MJ!
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

39:50.121 --> 39:52.289
<i>Promise me you won't make
any rash decisions.</i>

39:56.427 --> 39:57.561
I wanted this, Kara.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.230
<i>You can still have it.</i>

39:59.296 --> 40:01.766
<i>We just gotta be smart
and find a strategy.</i>

40:01.832 --> 40:03.067
<i>Okay? How does that sound?</i>

40:16.147 --> 40:18.482
Sounds like I'm gonna be in
for a crazy ride.
