WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.925
The FAA
is still gathering information,

00:07.925 --> 00:09.927
<i>but at this point,
stress that all evidence points</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:11.554
<i>to mechanical failure.</i>

00:11.554 --> 00:14.265
<i>Washington's recent budget cuts
will put an end</i>

00:14.265 --> 00:16.100
<i>to heightened
Coast Guard patrols</i>

00:16.100 --> 00:18.144
<i>along the Southeastern seaboard.</i>

00:18.144 --> 00:21.147
<i>Critics say the year-long
blockade has been credited</i>

00:21.147 --> 00:23.399
<i>with hundreds of successful
search-and-seizures</i>

00:23.399 --> 00:25.943
<i>of contraband, including...</i>

00:28.571 --> 00:30.573
We shouldn't have left her,

00:30.573 --> 00:32.700
just lying dead there.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.245
We called 911.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.621
Still...

00:37.705 --> 00:39.165
We couldn't stick around.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.083
Margrave PD is dirty.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.086
Who's to say that Atlanta
or Georgia State Police

00:44.170 --> 00:45.629
aren't on Kliner's payroll, too?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.174
The only way to make Molly
Beth's death mean something

00:48.174 --> 00:49.800
is by catching
whoever killed her.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.469
We can't do that
if we're shot dead

00:51.469 --> 00:53.220
by crooked cops
or rotting away in jail

00:53.304 --> 00:55.014
with her murder pinned on us.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.686
Pull over.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.029
What the hell are we doing?

01:10.029 --> 01:12.114
Long story. Be right back.

01:16.327 --> 01:18.829
It's okay.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.831
What's he doing to you?

01:23.667 --> 01:25.211
Collar's cutting him.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.714
Enough of this.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.300
What are you doing?

01:31.300 --> 01:33.969
Dog didn't do anything
to anybody.

01:34.053 --> 01:35.471
Doesn't deserve this.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.473
I told you
to stay off my property!

01:40.893 --> 01:42.853
Seriously?

01:46.565 --> 01:48.818
Let's see how <i>you</i> like it.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.531
- Let's go, boy.
- Come on.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.085
Okay.

02:06.085 --> 02:08.462
So, what are we gonna do now?

02:08.546 --> 02:10.631
Take the dog
to a no-kill shelter,

02:10.631 --> 02:12.591
then drop me off at Hubble's.

02:12.675 --> 02:14.552
Why?

02:14.552 --> 02:16.971
Last car they gave me
is full of bullet holes.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.639
Need a new one.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.686
Okay, we'll see you at
the station house parking lot.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.191
Hey. Are you okay?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.487
I never should have let her
get involved.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.567
That'll do.

04:11.835 --> 04:15.631
How come your owner's buying
you and your pals so much feed?

04:23.639 --> 04:25.683
Lot of help you are.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.025
Shit!

05:18.444 --> 05:20.362
And so...
so I'm stuffing this sucker

05:20.446 --> 05:23.741
full of M-80s, cherry bombs,
uh, ash cans...

05:23.741 --> 05:25.743
- Bottle rockets.
- ...bottle rockets.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.911
So, Dawson lights it.
We take off.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.497
Mailbox explodes.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.750
There's burning paper and metal
going everywhere, right?

05:32.750 --> 05:34.793
Six months later,
we're at the Gas 'N Such,

05:34.877 --> 05:36.336
and there's old man Slattery.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.130
He's getting arrested
in the parking lot.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.467
Bench warrant for not showing up
for jury duty.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.844
There was a jury summons
in the fuckin' mailbox.

05:50.142 --> 05:53.687
And that's what he gets for
failing my ass in English lit.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.740
Look, it's the war criminal.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.495
Hey, you're hungry,
I'll buy you a meal, man.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.538
You know, help out the homeless.

06:11.622 --> 06:15.292
This is the guy that
I was talking to you about.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.377
You know, uh,
you and my friend Emmitt here,

06:17.461 --> 06:19.379
you actually got something
in common.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.298
Both played college football.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.134
Old Emmitt here was Georgia
State's starting tight end

06:24.218 --> 06:25.761
for three years.

06:25.761 --> 06:30.265
According to your records,
you played one game for Army.

06:32.101 --> 06:34.895
What happened, man?
You couldn't hack it?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.439
- They kicked me off.
- What for?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.316
Being too violent.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.033
You're interrupting our lunch.

06:48.117 --> 06:49.868
Let me ask you something.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.329
What kind of man are you?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.666
A stupid man?

06:55.666 --> 06:57.918
A bitter man?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.003
Or are you just...

07:00.087 --> 07:03.841
an insecure, spoiled rich boy
hiding behind Daddy's money?

07:06.927 --> 07:10.055
It wasn't a rhetorical question.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.141
I really want to know
what kind of man

07:12.141 --> 07:15.477
enjoys intimidating
a woman half his size.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.604
A woman who...

07:17.688 --> 07:20.649
by the way,
is beyond intimidation.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.823
I think I know
what kind of guy you are.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.618
You're the kind of guy
that knows things.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.413
You knew I'd come after you

07:34.413 --> 07:36.957
when I saw what you did
to Roscoe.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.878
You knew I'd see your truck
right outside.

07:40.878 --> 07:44.089
A work truck whose bed's
never had anything in it

07:44.173 --> 07:45.632
other than a keg.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.219
And you knew I'd come in here
and cause a problem

07:49.303 --> 07:52.514
that would most likely
get me in trouble.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.559
But know what you don't know?

07:55.559 --> 07:57.436
Mm. What's that?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.855
What it feels like
when I hit you.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.982
'Cause if you did, you never
would have picked up

08:01.982 --> 08:03.650
that paint can.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.154
Okay.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.075
Now let me tell you something
about Roscoe Conklin.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.913
That little cocktease...

08:35.474 --> 08:37.559
- Drop it.
- Hey! I never liked you, Dawson.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.312
- Don't make me prove it.
- Drop the knife, or I drop you, KJ.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.022
Son.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.482
Put it down.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.537
This ain't over.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.207
- Anytime you want to dance.
- Since the moment this man arrived

09:00.207 --> 09:02.876
in Margrave, there's been
nothing but violence.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.711
And now he's attacked my son?

09:04.795 --> 09:06.588
That's it,
you get him out of here.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.174
Last time I checked,
you weren't my boss.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.718
Captain Finlay...

09:13.220 --> 09:15.097
...you're a city boy,

09:15.097 --> 09:17.808
so maybe you haven't heard
the expression.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.561
But if you keep digging
for water under the outhouse,

09:21.645 --> 09:23.605
you ain't gonna find nothin'
you can drink.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.941
So you stop this nonsense
already

09:25.941 --> 09:28.443
before someone gets hurt.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.071
I-I saw the whole thing.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.365
Junior and the boys were
just minding their own business,

09:33.365 --> 09:35.450
when this guy came in and
started tearing up the place.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.952
Thank you, Earl,

09:36.952 --> 09:39.663
for being a good citizen
of Margrave.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.958
Detective.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.712
Roscoe, take Reacher outside.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.966
See you soon, Junior.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.324
Molly Beth died 'cause she cared
about a Reacher.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.789
Yeah.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.878
It's Teale.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.465
Chief Teale.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.550
Yes.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.386
Uh... I wasn't aware of that.

10:37.596 --> 10:40.349
It must have been an oversight
on my part.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.227
What?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.438
Are you kidding me? No, no, no.
I just got the report mixed up

10:46.438 --> 10:48.023
with something else.
Motherfucker!

10:48.023 --> 10:49.900
- Fuck you!
- Easy. What's going on?

10:49.900 --> 10:51.693
- Teale just fired me.
- For what?

10:51.777 --> 10:53.695
When the report came in
for Joe's car,

10:53.779 --> 10:55.197
I said that the plates
matched a ride

10:55.197 --> 10:56.907
belonging to a con
that Morrison put away.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.492
Well, Teale just pulled up
the report

10:58.492 --> 11:01.078
and saw that the car was
reported as having no plates.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.162
He said that we're investigating

11:02.162 --> 11:03.413
the murder
of a goddamn police chief.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.956
He's not gonna have shoddy work
muck it up.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.041
And then he shit-canned me.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.334
You guys
have been running around,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.336
not in the office that much.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.380
He starts pulling up files
to check on your work.

11:11.380 --> 11:15.300
- He's getting suspicious.
- I'll talk to him and try to undo this.

11:15.384 --> 11:18.178
- I'm not handing in my gun.
- With all that's going on, I wouldn't want you to.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.180
Just let me talk
to the man, okay?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.765
This is bullshit!

11:21.765 --> 11:23.350
What about him?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.227
Is he going back to jail?

11:25.227 --> 11:26.520
Kliner isn't pressing charges.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.105
'Cause he doesn't want
to go to court.

11:28.105 --> 11:30.107
A lawsuit lets me ask
for discovery about KJ

11:31.525 --> 11:33.360
his employment records
at Kliner Industries,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.486
maybe Kliner's books.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.862
They don't want that.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.823
Okay, so what do we do now?
I'm not done with this

11:37.823 --> 11:38.990
just 'cause I'm not a cop
anymore.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.826
We go back to Joe's punch list.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.536
It was his blueprint;
it should be ours, too.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.787
We've been over it.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.372
The professors
are still out of the country,

11:45.372 --> 11:47.624
and your friend Neagley is
looking into the Memphis angle.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.126
There's nothing
in Jobling's garage.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.586
- So it's down to Gray's files.
- I told you,

11:51.670 --> 11:53.422
he didn't leave anything behind.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.467
Actually, he did.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.885
Not files,

11:58.969 --> 12:00.804
but he left you
his Desert Eagle.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.764
Like, a year before he died.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.516
Exactly.
People thinking about suicide

12:04.516 --> 12:06.309
normally give away
their prize possessions

12:06.393 --> 12:09.104
right before they take their
lives, not a full year prior.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.527
I want to see the box
it came in.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.154
Just be careful
with it.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.780
It means a lot to me.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.748
Empty.

12:54.900 --> 12:55.942
Fuck.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.194
Language.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.871
Was there any kind
of file cabinet or lockbox

13:07.871 --> 13:10.624
- in Gray's house when he died?
- No.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.209
- Nothing.
- Any other place

13:12.209 --> 13:13.752
he might have kept
something important?

13:13.752 --> 13:15.504
The only places

13:15.504 --> 13:19.090
Gray spent time were
the station and his house.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.926
That's not entirely accurate.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.928
When we were at the motel
in Alabama, you said

13:22.928 --> 13:25.722
- Gray used to get his hair cut once a week.
- Yeah.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.142
Why does a man with hardly
any hair need a weekly trim?

13:31.770 --> 13:35.607
Gray told me to give this
to nobody but you.

13:36.942 --> 13:40.862
Also said if you
ever came looking for it,

13:40.946 --> 13:43.114
he wanted you to know that...

13:43.198 --> 13:45.116
he was proud of his girl.

14:15.564 --> 14:19.359
He left me daisies.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.115
According to
livestock auction receipts,

14:25.115 --> 14:28.118
Kliner has 116 cattle.
All bought at once.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.203
Oh, my God. Here we go
with the cows again.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.163
It's a weird number.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.874
Who buys 116 cattle?
You'd buy a lot.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.419
- Twenty, 50, 100.
- Your point?

14:37.419 --> 14:39.254
I don't know. It's just...

14:39.254 --> 14:42.257
It was a hell of a lot
of animal feed.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.092
Well, it was.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.844
Tell me this.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.305
When does a family farm
become a commercial farm

14:48.305 --> 14:49.764
in Georgia?
How big does it have to get?

14:49.848 --> 14:51.891
This is not a lead.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.393
Humor me.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.397
I don't know. I remember

14:57.397 --> 14:59.608
when my uncle
got up to around 120 head,

14:59.608 --> 15:01.067
he had to file
with the state. Why?

15:01.151 --> 15:03.445
So, Kliner stops at 116.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.030
Just under the number
where he'd be subject

15:05.030 --> 15:06.740
to state inspectors
coming on his land,

15:06.740 --> 15:08.742
- checking out his operation.
- What operation?

15:08.742 --> 15:11.077
He has cows
and a herd that is not that big.

15:11.161 --> 15:12.662
Let it rest, Stretch.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.456
You know what was big?

15:14.456 --> 15:15.790
If you say
"the amount of animal feed,"

15:15.874 --> 15:16.791
I swear to God, you're not

15:16.875 --> 15:17.959
gonna have to worry about Kliner

15:18.043 --> 15:20.045
because I will cut
your balls off myself.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.298
Tomato and mayo.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.134
Thought you folks could use

15:26.134 --> 15:28.011
a little sustenance.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.346
Thank you, sir.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.722
Thank you.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.390
You wouldn't
happen to have

15:32.474 --> 15:34.934
any fruit or a salad,
would you, Mr. Mosley?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.895
I got tomato salad.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.772
With mayo.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.233
Between two slices of bread.
Right-right in front of you.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.861
Thank you.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.990

15:50.909 --> 15:53.536
You weren't kidding about the
quality of Gray's work, Roscoe.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.705
It is meticulous.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.124
He reviewed every tax return
for the Kliner Fund.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.377
Almost a full forensic accounting.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.420
Seem there was money
pouring out of the fund,

16:02.504 --> 16:03.797
but it doesn't match
income stream.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.340
How does a charity attract

16:05.340 --> 16:07.050
this much in donations when,

16:07.050 --> 16:09.761
from what I can see,
it's solely focused on giving

16:09.761 --> 16:11.304
to the businesses
and community groups

16:11.388 --> 16:12.806
of one tiny Georgia town?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.641
It doesn't.
Doesn't need donations

16:14.641 --> 16:17.185
- when it can just print its own cash.
- Exactly.

16:17.185 --> 16:19.229
He's been buying
everyone's silence.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.106
It's insurance.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.774
If Margrave citizens

16:22.774 --> 16:26.069
ever see anything off
with Kliner, suspect anything,

16:26.069 --> 16:28.530
if they're ever put on a jury
or even questioned,

16:28.530 --> 16:30.448
Kliner has already bought
their loyalty

16:30.532 --> 16:31.950
with the Kliner Fund.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.703
So, Kliner owns Margrave
and its citizens.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.247
This guy's
pulling all the strings.

16:37.247 --> 16:39.916
- Are these files enough to prosecute him?
- No.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.085
Tax returns
are the end of the rainbow.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.046
Dry numbers
that simply represent actions.

16:45.130 --> 16:48.299
In this case, ostensibly legal
charitable contributions.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.428
We need direct proof linking
counterfeit cash to Kliner,

16:51.428 --> 16:52.762
and we don't have it.

16:52.846 --> 16:56.182
Of all the places to do this,
why Margrave?

16:56.266 --> 16:59.269
There are dying towns all over.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.773
<i>Take today ♪</i>♪

17:03.857 --> 17:04.983
I'll show you why.

17:09.738 --> 17:11.614
What are you doing?

17:12.657 --> 17:16.453
Margrave is perfectly located
for distribution.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.121
The old state route
arterial systems

17:18.121 --> 17:19.456
cross right through here.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.833
Shipping fake cash from here,
Kliner's trucks

17:21.833 --> 17:23.877
can avoid federal interstates
for most of the trip,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.420
literally staying off the radar
of cops

17:25.420 --> 17:27.380
with a much bigger presence
on busier highways.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.215
He had a very well-oiled
and thought-out operation

17:29.299 --> 17:30.675
to protect, so he protected it.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.136
Okay. I get that.

17:33.136 --> 17:36.264
But why would he
suddenly go scorched-earth?

17:36.264 --> 17:39.017
A Secret Service agent
was investigating his operation.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.477
He eliminated that threat.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.270
So then he has
a police chief murdered?

17:42.270 --> 17:43.730
Tries to take out another cop?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.732
Then he goes after
the Secret Service agent's

17:45.732 --> 17:46.858
civilian brother?
I mean, that seems

17:46.858 --> 17:48.526
like a major overcorrection.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.201
It's the Coast Guard blockade.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.369
News has been talking about it
for days.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.079
Blockades have been going on
for a year,

18:00.163 --> 18:02.248
which means no funny money
coming into the U.S.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.958
So there's a huge backlog

18:04.042 --> 18:06.294
of counterfeit cash overseas,
making the whole outfit

18:06.294 --> 18:07.837
vulnerable to being caught.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.215
And Kliner's stateside
running low on supply.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.384
His buyers are expecting pallets
of bills he can't provide,

18:13.468 --> 18:14.928
and the kind of guys
that buy this kind of product

18:14.928 --> 18:16.471
don't respond well
to disappointment.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.056
What would you do with it all?

18:18.056 --> 18:19.974
Maybe someone wants to
buy something really dangerous

18:20.058 --> 18:21.226
that's really expensive.

18:21.226 --> 18:22.560
Think suitcase nuke.

18:22.644 --> 18:23.728
But they don't have the money

18:23.812 --> 18:25.730
to do it,
so they're printing their own.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.524
Or they want to destabilize
the U.S. economy.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.234
Or destabilize
a strategic nation

18:29.234 --> 18:30.819
that runs on U.S. currency,

18:30.819 --> 18:32.737
like Panama,
which a significant percentage

18:32.821 --> 18:34.489
of world trade
passes through each year.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.699
Bottom line, I don't care
why they want to do it.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.159
You and the FBI can
figure all that out

18:38.243 --> 18:40.078
after the people that killed Joe
are dead.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.913
Gray didn't commit suicide.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.166
They fucking murdered him.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.882
I'll talk to her.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.492
I don't want to do it.
I'm not going.

19:19.576 --> 19:21.452
You and your brother
are both getting your hair cut,

19:21.536 --> 19:22.704
putting on your Sunday best

19:22.704 --> 19:23.955
and marching yourselves
over there.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.623
Our family is not a democracy.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.292
You have no vote and no say.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.626
- But...
- Shh.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.337
Now, hold still
before Grace cuts your ear off.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.424
All done. What do you think?

19:50.023 --> 19:53.026
Sir. Ma'am.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.659
Joe.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.332
I'm very sorry
for what happened.

20:07.332 --> 20:10.126
I have no excuse for my actions.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.628
I hope you can forgive me,

20:11.628 --> 20:14.380
though I understand
if you can't.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.632
Your turn, Reacher.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.260
No.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.554
You've had nothing
but run-ins with Curtis

20:21.638 --> 20:22.805
since we arrived.

20:22.889 --> 20:23.973
Apologize.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.183
No.

20:25.183 --> 20:27.352
Look at my son.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.521
You can't even bring yourself
to say you're sorry?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.865
I'm sorry.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.576
I'm sorry

20:43.660 --> 20:46.329
the left side of his face
doesn't look like the right.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.553
- Those fucking bastards spoke at his funeral.
- Roscoe.

21:02.637 --> 21:05.264
You want to save your town?
Avenge Gray? Good.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.599
Harness that.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.434
Bad people should get
what's coming to them.

21:08.518 --> 21:09.560
No apologies.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.440
Neagley.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.445
Got it.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.824
What'd she say?

21:22.824 --> 21:24.409
She said
she wanted dinner at 10:00,

21:24.409 --> 21:26.160
but instead, she had it at 6:00.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.121
What in God's name
does that mean?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.915
Ten-six is MP radio code
for "send civilian police."

21:30.999 --> 21:33.126
Means she's found something
important enough she doesn't

21:33.126 --> 21:35.211
trust talking about it
on an unsecured line.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.506
And she's taking a shot at me
for being a civilian now.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.591
She likes to poke the bear.

21:40.675 --> 21:43.136
I just can't vanish to Memphis
for a day or two.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.513
Teale will get suspicious.
He's suspicious already.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.390
Shouldn't come anyway.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.308
- Neagley doesn't like meeting new people.
- If she can't

21:49.392 --> 21:51.728
tell you where she is, how
the hell are you gonna find her?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.438
Won't be a problem.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.609
<i>She'll avoid tourist traps
for privacy.</i>

21:58.693 --> 22:01.612
<i>That eliminates anyplace
around Beale Street.</i>

22:01.696 --> 22:04.365
<i>Also anything
around the university.</i>

22:04.449 --> 22:07.076
<i>People older than college
students would stand out.</i>

22:08.077 --> 22:09.954
<i>Neagley grew up broke,</i>

22:10.038 --> 22:12.123
<i>so she watches her money.</i>

22:12.123 --> 22:14.208
<i>Wherever she's staying
won't be five stars.</i>

22:14.292 --> 22:17.170
<i>She'll choose
a decent discount hotel.</i>

22:17.170 --> 22:18.796
<i>Something you'd find
near midtown,</i>

22:18.880 --> 22:20.631
<i>close to public transportation.</i>

22:25.261 --> 22:28.222
<i>Near a place to eat
that's reasonably priced</i>

22:28.306 --> 22:30.641
<i>and isn't a chain restaurant.</i>

22:44.155 --> 22:46.908
Thank you.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.077
How's it going, big fella?

22:49.077 --> 22:51.079
Neagley.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.039
I knew I'd track you down.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.999
You wish.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.751
I tracked you.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.045
Ten years together
in Special Investigators,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.963
I know how you think.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.591
Figured I'd come to midtown,
avoid tourists,

23:03.591 --> 23:05.635
find a serviceable hotel

23:05.635 --> 23:07.637
close to mass transit,
near a decent restaurant.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.847
And...

23:09.931 --> 23:12.308
I know after a morning flight
with no meal service,

23:12.308 --> 23:14.143
Jack The Beanstalk's

23:14.227 --> 23:15.686
going straight
for the mess hall.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.355
And you knew
I'd come to a bistro

23:17.355 --> 23:18.523
because my mother was French.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.942
It's got the biggest sign.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.944
You're not that complicated.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.987
And I wanted Cocoa Puffs.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.156
All right, so you aren't
staying across the street?

23:27.240 --> 23:29.033
Please.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.369
Four Seasons.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.412
I'm in the private sector now.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.456
I've got miles.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.750
Okay.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.585
Let's go.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.254
- I'll fill you in.
- I haven't eaten yet.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.589
I got beignets.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.508
Masticate on the move.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.721
Pretty open space.

23:50.805 --> 23:53.558
If anybody had a parabolic mic,
we'd see 'em.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.227
- Safe to speak freely.
- Fine.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.813
You need a woman in your life.

23:58.813 --> 24:01.399
Oh, you mean about the case?

24:01.399 --> 24:03.776
The "J.W." on your brother's
punch list was

24:03.860 --> 24:06.404
an EPA investigator
named Jimmy Dupree Wilks.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.698
- Was?
- Gunned down in his home.

24:08.698 --> 24:10.491
Dead fed.

24:10.575 --> 24:12.201
So FBI jumped in?

24:12.285 --> 24:14.704
Determined it was
a random burglary gone bad.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.789
You think they're wrong.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.416
Murder weapon was
a small caliber,

24:18.416 --> 24:19.750
nine millimeter, subsonic.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.128
Burglars don't use silencers.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.213
Most don't carry guns at all.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.632
Also, burglars steal things.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.342
Nothing was taken.

24:28.426 --> 24:29.844
Affirmative.

24:29.844 --> 24:31.345
One more odd detail.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.097
The body was beaten
like a pinata.

24:33.181 --> 24:34.765
Post-mortem.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.726
Don't see that every day.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.061
Happens more often
than you think.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.938
Meaning?

24:41.022 --> 24:43.316
That's what they did
to my brother.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.401
Shit.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.198
You're gonna kill a whole lot
of people, aren't you?

24:50.198 --> 24:52.575
Already started.

24:55.453 --> 24:58.331
Well, you should know, then,
I'm not the only one

24:58.331 --> 25:00.333
who thought
there was something anomalous.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.085
Memphis cop, Aucoin,
he caught the Wilks case

25:03.169 --> 25:05.421
and was looking into it
before the FBI took over.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.466
His original report noted
his suspicion.

25:08.466 --> 25:10.426
So you tracked him down.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.720
He said he's been waiting
five years for a call

25:12.720 --> 25:15.389
from someone about this.
He and his partner

25:15.473 --> 25:17.975
are gonna take us to meet
low-level hitman

25:18.059 --> 25:20.394
who might know
who was hired to kill Wilks.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.438
EPA investigators aren't
common targets.

25:22.438 --> 25:24.440
Where was he poking around?

25:24.440 --> 25:26.567
Made a FOIL request
for his records.

25:26.651 --> 25:28.778
He was looking
into toxic pollution levels

25:28.778 --> 25:30.238
in the Mississippi.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.698
- Source?
- Wish I could tell you,

25:32.782 --> 25:34.659
but the first two chapters
of Wilks' report

25:34.659 --> 25:36.577
cover the extent
of the pollution

25:36.661 --> 25:38.162
and the third chapter,

25:38.246 --> 25:40.831
the one that deals
with the source, is missing.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.792
Let me guess.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.460
The EPA can't locate it.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.212
Lost like Roanoke.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.713
Like the pages were never
written.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.340
But the pollution

25:49.340 --> 25:51.550
seemed to hit hardest
at Chester, Arkansas.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.886
So that's where we go.

25:56.639 --> 25:58.391
Reacher...

25:58.391 --> 26:01.185
they made files
disappear at a federal agency.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.979
You're not tracking
some corporal

26:02.979 --> 26:04.563
who punched his sergeant.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.316
These people are connected
and stone-cold killers.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.612
Something happens to you...

26:11.696 --> 26:13.656
it would be
like losing two friends.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.950
You know, given your size.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.209
Let me ask you something.

26:25.293 --> 26:28.045
If a guy I like for the murders
was ordering 18-wheelers full

26:28.129 --> 26:30.506
of animal feed when he doesn't
need nearly that much,

26:30.506 --> 26:32.842
would you see a connection
with what we're looking into?

26:34.552 --> 26:36.470
Not off the top of my head.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.766
Hell of a lot
of animal feed, though.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.603
That's why I like you, Neagley.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.610
Why are you so big?

26:51.694 --> 26:53.446
Genetics.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.117
Beignet?

27:00.244 --> 27:02.580
<i>♪ No, no,
ain't got no</i> ♪

27:02.580 --> 27:04.206
<i>Ain't no, no, no ♪</i>♪

27:04.290 --> 27:05.750
No, no, no, no!

27:05.750 --> 27:07.126
Darn it!

27:07.126 --> 27:08.919
Mm!

27:09.003 --> 27:10.755
- Roscoe.
- Am I interrupting?

27:10.755 --> 27:12.840
No, no, I was just
finishing, uh, finishing up

27:12.840 --> 27:15.301
some wor...
uh, medical examining...

27:15.301 --> 27:17.219
Um, what can I do for you?

27:17.303 --> 27:18.763
Don't tell me
there's been another murder.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.181
Maybe.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.974
"No" would've been better.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.769
When Officer Gray died,

27:24.769 --> 27:26.437
I remember the mortician

27:26.437 --> 27:28.189
saying that they had
to fix a cut on his head

27:28.189 --> 27:30.107
with makeup and putty 'cause...

27:30.191 --> 27:32.109
supposedly he was so drunk
that he fell trying to get up

27:32.193 --> 27:33.486
on the chair to...

27:33.486 --> 27:35.321
you know, the rope and all.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.573
Yeah. I recall there being
a severe contusion.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.033
It looked like he hit
the corner of a chair

27:39.033 --> 27:41.243
or his workbench or something.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.787
Can you... pull it up?

27:42.787 --> 27:44.872
Yeah, okay.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.128
Here it is.

28:02.932 --> 28:04.892
Would like me to go
through these for you?

28:04.892 --> 28:06.519
- Maybe I can find what you're looking for.
- No.

28:06.519 --> 28:08.604
Thank you, I'm fine.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.484
Okay.

28:15.277 --> 28:18.906
Instead of hitting his head
on something...

28:18.906 --> 28:21.617
could something have
hit his head?

28:22.660 --> 28:24.286
- Mean he was struck?
- Yeah.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.372
That is exactly what I mean.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.707
Suppose. Resulting wound would,

28:28.791 --> 28:30.376
at least superficially,
look the same.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.877
But truth be told,
I never looked

28:31.961 --> 28:32.920
at the injury that way.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.714
- Can you? Now?
- Oh... oh, okay.

28:35.798 --> 28:38.843
I can zoom in tight,
see what's there.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.806
There it is.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.476
Well, that's interesting.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.396
When you heighten contrast
on skin edema,

28:50.396 --> 28:52.314
especially around
a head wound which produces

28:52.398 --> 28:55.317
a lot of bleeding,
you pick up micro-lacerations,

28:55.401 --> 28:56.819
which can often show the shape

28:56.819 --> 28:58.279
of the object
causing the injury.

28:58.279 --> 28:59.905
- Mm-hmm.
- So if I...

28:59.989 --> 29:01.615
zoom in a little more...

29:03.951 --> 29:05.327
Huh.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.246
Kind of look like a diamond.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.540
Doesn't it?

29:11.625 --> 29:13.627
Yeah.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.132
Damn right it does.

29:27.641 --> 29:31.479
<i>In the city of the angels ♪</i>

29:35.024 --> 29:36.817
<i>♪ The pretty one goes around...</i>

29:36.901 --> 29:39.653
Mind if we ask you
some questions about the river?

29:39.737 --> 29:43.199
I ain't got a license
and I ain't payin' no fine.

29:43.199 --> 29:46.076
Not here about a license.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.914
Really? Ya look government.

29:49.914 --> 29:52.208
Good instincts,
but I don't care where you fish.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.418
Ah, good.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.634
There's an empty oil drum
right there, Pigpen.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.763
Oil drum's cleaner
than the river.

30:07.348 --> 30:08.849
That's why we're here.

30:08.933 --> 30:10.643
To find out
what happened in Chester.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.645
To the river.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.980
Clarron Chemical's
what happened.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.274
Took a big shit upstream.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.984
Shit floated downstream.

30:19.068 --> 30:20.778
Now all we got left is shit.

30:20.778 --> 30:22.613
Who's Clarron?

30:22.613 --> 30:24.740
Bunch of rich people
in business clothes

30:24.740 --> 30:26.659
who tore through our town
like locusts,

30:26.659 --> 30:28.577
not even leaving
bark on the trees.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.621
They have anything
to do with animal feed?

30:30.621 --> 30:31.997
Production of it, selling it?

30:32.081 --> 30:34.583
I said Clarron Chemical.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.961
Not Clarron Grain & Seed.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.131
Where you going?

30:41.215 --> 30:43.008
You're boring.

30:43.092 --> 30:45.135
I still have questions.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.806
You ain't the first man
come through

30:48.806 --> 30:51.100
asking about
our stretch of the river.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.935
EPA came through here years ago,

30:52.935 --> 30:55.396
talking about
how the geography makes

30:55.396 --> 30:57.022
the toxins settle here,

30:57.106 --> 30:58.983
killing all the crawdads
and catfish.

30:58.983 --> 31:00.776
Said he was gonna clean it up

31:00.776 --> 31:02.486
'cause no one could earn
on the water any more.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.488
You know what he did?

31:04.572 --> 31:06.407
Nothing. Know why?

31:06.407 --> 31:07.533
No.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.742
He was killed.

31:08.826 --> 31:11.787
Yeah, well...

31:11.787 --> 31:14.290
so was this town.

31:16.584 --> 31:19.169
If the river's ruined, why fish?

31:19.253 --> 31:22.214
What else am I gonna do
around here?

31:25.384 --> 31:27.428
So Clarron Chemical's been

31:27.428 --> 31:29.722
out of business for years.
Not bankruptcy, though.

31:29.722 --> 31:31.140
Just dissolved.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.350
But there was
a parent corporation.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.144
Kliner Industries.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.937
Looks like Kliner
destroyed Chester

31:37.021 --> 31:38.647
and moved on to Margrave.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.441
Joe wasn't the first
federal agent he had killed.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.401
He had Wilks taken out, too,

31:42.401 --> 31:44.153
before his polluting
was uncovered.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.946
Just can't prove it.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.781
Says who?

31:47.865 --> 31:49.199
Got a text from Aucoin.

31:49.283 --> 31:50.409
His CI's ready to meet.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.210
Ms. Conklin, you come
to clean out your desk?

32:00.294 --> 32:02.087
You son of a bitch!

32:02.171 --> 32:04.089
You fucking stupid fucker!

32:04.173 --> 32:06.342
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

32:06.342 --> 32:08.052
- That's assault!
- I'll fucking kill you!

32:08.052 --> 32:11.013
- Do something with her, Finlay!
- Not another word. Quiet!

32:11.013 --> 32:12.264
I'm gonna tase her,
I swear to God!

32:12.348 --> 32:13.515
You see to the mayor,
I'll take care of her.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.725
- Roscoe, let's go!
- Look at you!

32:14.725 --> 32:16.435
- Roscoe, let's go!
- Fuck you!

32:16.435 --> 32:18.437
- Here you go, boss.
- You're dead!

32:18.437 --> 32:21.065
I got my handkerchief,
you asshole.

32:21.065 --> 32:23.734
The hell is wrong with you?

32:23.734 --> 32:25.694
We've been playing
cat and mouse with 'em.

32:25.778 --> 32:27.029
They were suspicious.

32:27.029 --> 32:28.364
But now they know
you know something!

32:28.364 --> 32:30.783
I know that old bastard
killed Gray.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.452
By now Teale's calling
for your arrest.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.537
And once you're in custody,
they'll take you out

32:35.621 --> 32:38.582
like they tried to kill Reacher
when they had him locked up.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.213
You're not eight feet tall,
300 pounds

32:44.213 --> 32:46.090
like our friend.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.510
I got to get you out of town.

32:49.510 --> 32:52.179
You can't show your face
in Margrave now.

32:58.102 --> 33:01.730
Reacher, this is Officer Aucoin.

33:01.814 --> 33:04.525
This is my partner, Ribidoux.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.695
No thank you.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.197
She's not big on contact.

33:10.197 --> 33:13.283
Guy we're meeting is
a small time trigger-puller.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.494
He knows his place in the food
chain. He's not the kind

33:15.494 --> 33:17.204
to take out a fed or a cop,
but he keeps his ears open

33:17.204 --> 33:19.081
and he's happy to talk
when it suits him.

33:19.081 --> 33:21.458
- What makes you think this will suit him?
- He's been a go-to CI.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.460
- Wants to keep his seat on the gravy train.
- Hey.

33:23.544 --> 33:26.505
Why we got to do this, man?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.507
This case is closed.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.509
We got families. Let it go.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.344
I can't.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.638
This mess got a fed killed.

33:34.722 --> 33:36.932
It ain't worth our lives, too.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.726
If it was worth
my brother's life,

33:38.726 --> 33:40.394
it's sure as hell worth yours.

33:41.729 --> 33:43.814
It's...

33:45.482 --> 33:47.234
Don't worry about him.

33:47.234 --> 33:50.279
Unless he gets pissed at you,
then worry about him.

33:59.621 --> 34:02.541
I'll check in.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.210
That way, if anyone comes
looking for a crazy white lady

34:05.294 --> 34:07.212
with a mean right hand,
desk clerk won't know

34:07.296 --> 34:09.631
- she's staying here.
- For how long?

34:09.715 --> 34:11.341
Until I figure out
what to do with you.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.385
- You can't bench me.
- You benched yourself.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.596
I got fired.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.681
You're not my boss anymore,
remember?

34:17.765 --> 34:19.141
I'm not doing this as your boss.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.101
I'm doing this as your friend.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.438
Now, stay put.
I'll be back in five.

34:35.449 --> 34:37.618
Picard, what's up?

34:39.912 --> 34:41.455
<i>Up in the club ♪</i>

34:41.455 --> 34:42.664
<i>♪ And I been done
looked at them slugs</i> ♪

34:42.748 --> 34:44.374
<i>♪ Up in the club...</i>

34:44.458 --> 34:46.585
Before I say anything,
how do I know

34:46.585 --> 34:47.753
it's not gonna bite me
in the ass?

34:47.753 --> 34:48.754
This isn't part

34:48.754 --> 34:50.422
of an official investigation.

34:50.506 --> 34:53.300
As far as the MPD is concerned,
we aren't even here.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.344
I promise
I won't come after you.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.179
Yeah. What about him?

34:57.179 --> 34:59.097
I don't give a shit about you.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.267
Okay.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.812
Look, I'm the kind
of guy that bad guys

35:04.812 --> 35:07.689
call when they've got
a problem with another bad guy.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.441
I don't do anything
that's gonna make the news,

35:09.525 --> 35:12.694
and I sure as hell
do not fuck around

35:12.778 --> 35:14.822
with badges, you feel me?

35:14.822 --> 35:17.574
So if you don't kill cops,
who does?

35:17.658 --> 35:19.493
Out-of-town talent.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.370
- A name.
- Well, uh...

35:21.370 --> 35:23.747
I don't know
what his mama called him,

35:23.831 --> 35:26.500
but he goes by "the Viking."

35:26.500 --> 35:28.460
That's it?

35:28.544 --> 35:30.295
All I know.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.756
You find the Viking,
you found your shooter.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.760
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get me a lap dance,

35:36.844 --> 35:38.971
and no self-respecting
stripper's gonna come to a table

35:38.971 --> 35:40.639
with two cops, this chick

35:40.639 --> 35:42.516
and a pissed-off giant.

35:42.516 --> 35:43.851
Adios.

35:48.856 --> 35:50.148
Come on!

35:50.232 --> 35:51.275
I said no!

35:57.239 --> 35:58.407
- Hey.
- I said no.

36:04.288 --> 36:06.373
When a woman says she doesn't
want to be touched,

36:06.373 --> 36:08.333
she doesn't want to be touched.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.630
You earned it.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.551
We can go now.

36:26.977 --> 36:29.813
Some nice moves back there.

36:29.897 --> 36:32.566
Better than the guy
who taught 'em to me.

36:39.615 --> 36:40.824
Yeah?

36:40.908 --> 36:43.035
Reacher,
we've had a development.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.454
Roscoe used Teale's head
as a punching bag.

36:45.454 --> 36:47.331
<i>- Good.</i>
- Not good.

36:47.331 --> 36:48.916
Target on her back
went neon.

36:48.916 --> 36:51.043
Already got a call
from Stevenson saying

36:51.043 --> 36:53.128
Teale wants a warrant out
for Roscoe's arrest.

36:53.128 --> 36:55.047
Can't trust Stevenson.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.590
I told him she was furious
about getting fired

36:56.590 --> 36:57.883
and that she jumped
out of my car

36:57.883 --> 37:00.010
at a stop light and took off.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.136
<i>Roscoe?</i>

37:01.136 --> 37:03.013
I'm here.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.726
Sorry, I just, uh...

37:07.726 --> 37:09.728
I lost it.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.855
No apologies, remember?

37:11.939 --> 37:13.357
You got to get out of town.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.816
<i>Already did. At a motel</i>

37:14.900 --> 37:17.069
across the state line,
but we have a better option.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.238
Picard just called, said that
he's gonna lose his job

37:20.322 --> 37:21.406
if he doesn't find someone else

37:21.490 --> 37:22.908
to take care of Charlie
and the kids.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.534
<i>So I'm gonna take over.</i>

37:24.618 --> 37:26.119
What about the Tweed Tornado?

37:28.205 --> 37:30.791
Thinking we have
to kick things up a notch.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.377
Gray's files didn't
have everything we need, right?

37:33.377 --> 37:35.712
Know whose do?

37:35.796 --> 37:38.173
Kliner's. I go to the source
after hours.

37:38.173 --> 37:41.051
See if I can get evidence
that nails this thing down.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.053
<i>No security cameras, remember?</i>

37:43.053 --> 37:46.098
Boy Scout's gonna do
an illegal search?

37:46.098 --> 37:48.016
Desperate times.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.686
Besides, it's not like
I'm killing someone.

37:50.686 --> 37:52.562
<i>You'll come around.</i>

37:52.646 --> 37:54.606
How's it going over there?

37:54.690 --> 37:56.525
Got a lead
on a shooter who took out

37:56.525 --> 37:58.735
an EPA agent
digging into Kliner.

37:58.819 --> 38:01.071
<i>Just a matter of time
before I get my hands on him.</i>

38:01.071 --> 38:02.322
Hey...

38:03.657 --> 38:05.325
I need you to promise me

38:05.409 --> 38:07.202
that you're not gonna
take out Teale without me.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.997
When the time comes,
I'll hold him while you hit him.

38:13.083 --> 38:15.168
Well...

38:15.252 --> 38:17.295
guess, uh...

38:17.379 --> 38:19.548
won't be seeing you for a while.

38:19.548 --> 38:21.883
I guess not.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.887
<i>Bye, Reacher.</i>

38:25.971 --> 38:27.973
Bye, Roscoe.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.062
You like her.

38:35.731 --> 38:37.858
How'd you know Roscoe was
a woman?

38:37.858 --> 38:40.110
From how you said her name.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.446
I said her name normally.

38:42.446 --> 38:44.573
- Mm-hmm.
- I said it normally.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.533
- Yeah, yep.
- Tell me how I said it.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.036
When we get
to the precinct we'll go

38:49.036 --> 38:50.454
through the alias database,

38:50.454 --> 38:51.788
We'll look up "Viking,"
see what pops up.

38:51.872 --> 38:53.915
People behind this have reach,

38:53.999 --> 38:55.625
maybe even into Memphis PD.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.586
We can't just walk right in.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.671
- No. We can't.
- Hey, what are you doing, man?

38:59.755 --> 39:02.215
- Ribidoux, hold on.
- Shoot him, Aucoin.

39:02.299 --> 39:03.967
- Put the gun down.
- Listen to me, you got to shoot him.

39:04.051 --> 39:06.720
- Don't move! They threatened to torture my family.
- Hey, whoa, hold on!

39:06.720 --> 39:08.346
- Shoot him!
- Draw your weapon and fire!

39:08.430 --> 39:09.931
They showed me a video of them
cutting a cop's balls off!

39:10.015 --> 39:11.558
You don't have to do this.
There's no need....

39:11.558 --> 39:13.060
- Grab your gun and fire or you're gonna die!
- Shoot!

39:13.060 --> 39:14.853
- You don't have to do this!
- I'm so sorry.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.147
No, no, hold on!
Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Don't...

39:20.442 --> 39:22.569
Fuck.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.072
I'm sorry...

39:25.072 --> 39:27.449
So sorry...

39:27.449 --> 39:30.285
I'm gonna pull in the woods,

39:30.285 --> 39:31.870
and I'm gonna open the door.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.455
I'm gonna shoot you
really quick.

39:33.455 --> 39:36.792
All right?
I... I promise a clean shot.

39:36.792 --> 39:37.959
A fast death.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.470
Jesus Christ!

39:49.971 --> 39:51.973
Fuck! Okay, okay!

40:03.485 --> 40:04.569
Oh, God.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.071
Hey! Hey!

40:06.071 --> 40:08.532
Help! Get me out of here,
please! Help!

40:08.532 --> 40:11.243
- Who threatened you?!
- I-I don't know!

40:11.243 --> 40:12.744
- I need a name!
- Tell him!

40:12.828 --> 40:14.996
I don't know. They had accents.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.249
That's all I know! Please!

40:17.249 --> 40:19.668
Please...

40:19.668 --> 40:22.379
Please let me out.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.260
My friend and I are
getting out of here.

40:28.260 --> 40:30.053
I can try and take you
with us, but if I do,

40:30.137 --> 40:32.472
you're going to jail,
and they'll kill you inside.

40:34.599 --> 40:35.976
And then they'll come
for your family,

40:35.976 --> 40:37.602
and you know
what they'll do to them.

40:37.686 --> 40:39.729
It's your call.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.569
Hail Mary...

40:45.569 --> 40:47.404
full of grace,

40:47.404 --> 40:49.906
the Lord is with thee,
blessed are thou...

40:49.990 --> 40:51.992
Take a deep breath.

41:32.282 --> 41:35.952
You do not mess
with the Special Investigators.

41:36.036 --> 41:38.371
You do not mess

41:38.455 --> 41:41.082
with the Special Investigators.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.840
Try these.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.813
What now?

42:03.897 --> 42:06.316
If Kliner forced
that cop to kill us,

42:06.316 --> 42:08.818
odds are he hired
the Viking, too.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.279
Finlay's breaking
into Kliner's office tonight.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.031
Maybe when he flips
over that rock,

42:13.031 --> 42:14.783
something important
will scurry out.

42:14.783 --> 42:16.534
I'm gonna head back to Margrave.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.504
You got to be shittin' me.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.177
This turned into more
than you bargained for

42:34.261 --> 42:36.096
when you agreed to help.

42:36.096 --> 42:38.473
Do me a favor and walk away.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.392
From the guys who killed your
brother and tried to kill us?

42:40.392 --> 42:42.018
Right.

42:42.102 --> 42:43.436
It's not a request.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.480
And you're not
my commanding officer anymore.

42:46.690 --> 42:48.900
I'm going back to Memphis.

42:48.984 --> 42:50.694
See what I can find out
about The Viking.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.946
I'll call you when I know more.

42:57.742 --> 42:59.619
Be safe, boss.

42:59.703 --> 43:02.247
You, too.

45:46.828 --> 45:49.539
