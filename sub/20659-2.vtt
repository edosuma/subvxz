Our main man is back!

18:15.594 --> 18:17.554
{\an3}- Oh, thank gosh.
Let's get your samples

18:17.638 --> 18:19.139
{\an3}so none of us
lose our jobs here, okay?

18:19.223 --> 18:20.808
{\an1}- No, you're not touching me.
Get away!

18:20.891 --> 18:22.309
{\an1}I gotta get Linda back.

We don't have
any drugs here, okay?

I'm interested in

18:50.295 --> 18:53.382
{\an1}is the rush of
endorphins and dopamine

I hang out with Linda.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.512

{\an3}- Where the hell
have you been?

19:00.305 --> 19:02.683
{\an3}And why was there
a baby at your house?

19:02.766 --> 19:05.686
{\an1}- Uh, that was little Randy.
Yeah, uh.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.564
{\an1}I'm doing a--an avant-garde
baby calendar shoot at my house.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.066

a surprise, but whatever.

19:11.149 --> 19:12.401

{\an1}Still, thank you for being
so caring and sweet

19:16.697 --> 19:19.241
{\an1}I wish I could say the same
thing for you, Chet.

- Huh?
- By the way.

19:20.951 --> 19:24.413

on this fancy baby monitor

Chet?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.254
- That's out of context.

19:32.337 --> 19:33.589
- Just get out of here!

19:33.672 --> 19:34.923
You disgust me!

19:35.007 --> 19:38.302
- Oh, I'm sorry Linda.
[stifled crying]

19:38.385 --> 19:39.595

19:39.678 --> 19:40.262
I just--
- Wait.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.931
I just want to say something.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.267
I'm a stupid, stupid idiot.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.311
{\an1}I had you, the most wonderful
woman in the world,

19:47.394 --> 19:49.313
{\an1}and I threw it all away
trying to impress you

19:49.396 --> 19:52.816

and Danish furniture

19:52.900 --> 19:55.110

friend and I miss him very much.

{\an1}I was battling
a freaky old-man disease,

{\an1}which was cured, but still,
that's no excuse

20:05.412 --> 20:09.249
{\an1}for making the biggest mistake
of my life:

20:09.333 --> 20:10.250
losing you.

20:10.334 --> 20:14.087
{\an3}- Look, Jeff,
I just need some time.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.131
But you haven't lost me.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.008
We can still be friends.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.176
{\an1}- Okay.
