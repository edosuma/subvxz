00:18.643 --> 00:21.021
 <i>One of my professors once told me</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:23.481
<i>a therapist can't depend on her patients</i>

00:23.481 --> 00:26.109
<i>to be reliable narrators
of their own lives.</i>

00:27.944 --> 00:30.321
<i>Not because they intend to be deceitful,</i>

00:31.030 --> 00:32.949
<i>but because the human condition is such...</i>

00:33.950 --> 00:37.287
<i>that we can want things
to be one way so badly,</i>

00:38.538 --> 00:41.249
<i>we aren't honest
about the way they really are.</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:45.587
<i>We can't be honest with others,</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:49.507
<i>because we can't even
be honest with ourselves.</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:53.887
Hey, sleepyhead.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.599
I had fun last night.

00:58.141 --> 01:02.353
It was super unexpected,
but in like the best way possible.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.816
It was definitely unexpected.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.904
So, not to be weird or whatever,

01:10.904 --> 01:14.157
but The National is playing
Pier 27 on Saturday

01:14.157 --> 01:16.451
and some friends from NYU are going.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.869
You want to come?

01:20.288 --> 01:21.956
You go to NYU?

01:22.624 --> 01:23.833
Yeah, I'm a junior.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.418
Okay.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.922
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.972
Sweet mother of Jesus.

01:37.972 --> 01:41.017
I had no idea your brother was here.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.227
Spence, did you know?

01:42.227 --> 01:45.396
No. Who could possibly think
anyone else was here?

01:45.396 --> 01:47.106
It was so quiet all night.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.525
Mm-hm.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.444
All I heard was the sound of silence.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.657
Ah-ah-ah. All right.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.242
Hey, I'm not complaining.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.538
Sounded like you had yourself
a good old time over and over.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.624
I am complaining
because it is not at all disturbing

02:04.624 --> 02:07.127
to hear your baby brother
getting his rocks off.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.921
You have roommates.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.133
Who's your friend, Cooper?

02:13.675 --> 02:16.511
Uh, this is Summer.

02:17.595 --> 02:18.930
Actually, I'm Autumn.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.599
At least he didn't go with Spring, honey.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.394
No big. I didn't remember his name
'til you just said it.

02:24.394 --> 02:25.478
Ooh. I like her.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.646
See you, Coop.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.776
So, where did you and Autumn meet?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.488
I think she was my Uber driver.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.907
I hope you gave her a five-star rating.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.784
Cooper, what are you doing?

02:39.784 --> 02:42.203
Making up for lost time.
What does it matter to you?

02:42.203 --> 02:46.374
This is the first time you spent the night
at our house since you split from Billie.

02:46.374 --> 02:49.419
- You got a random teenager with you.
- Okay.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.503
She's in college.

02:50.503 --> 02:54.007
Shower's calling. Go easy on him, Spence.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.220
You remember Francesca,
your "alleged" girlfriend?

03:00.138 --> 03:02.724
I've never met her before
but she texted me last night repeatedly

03:02.724 --> 03:05.184
saying she hadn't heard from you in days
and was worried sick.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.562
- Shit.
- I covered for you,

03:07.562 --> 03:09.522
but you introduced her to your kids.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.857
What happened?

03:13.651 --> 03:15.028
I had a run-in with Billie.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.114
A couple, actually.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.659
Cooper, you need to take time

03:21.659 --> 03:24.037
to deal with the emotional fallout
from your split.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.955
- I am.
- No, you're not.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.499
You walked out on Billie
and ran straight to Francesca,

03:28.499 --> 03:30.919
and you jumped in with both feet
on the same night.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.295
Divorce is a huge loss.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.589
- It's like a death.
- A death I wanted.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.050
Everything I'm doing now is what I want.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.885
Maybe for the first time in my life.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.512
I did the whole
"sex is a salve for your problems" thing,

03:41.512 --> 03:44.515
it works great for 15 minutes,
you feel like the hottest guy.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.684
You forget how much
you fucking hate yourself.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.519
No, I hate her. Not me.

03:48.519 --> 03:52.023
Mm-hm. You've never hated anyone.
You've never had a reason to.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.192
Which means you've lived
a pretty charmed life.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.362
It also means now that things
aren't going exactly according to plan,

03:57.362 --> 03:58.905
you don't know how to process.

04:00.031 --> 04:04.535
I always knew some good would come out
of being a miserable, closeted gay kid

04:04.535 --> 04:06.579
in uber-heteronormative '90s Connecticut.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.331
It was fucking traumatizing.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.458
But I dealt with my shit

04:10.458 --> 04:13.253
so I could show up
for the rest of my life, including Brett.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.337
Good for you.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.548
Whatever you're going through,
just go through it.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.759
Come out the other end like I did.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.429
Try to minimize collateral damage.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.682
It's not fair
to drag Francesca down with you.

04:28.226 --> 04:33.982
Okay, honey, I am gonna miss you so much.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.692
But I hope you have fun with Daddy.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.861
Daddy said he's taking us for sledding
and hot chocolate.

04:38.861 --> 04:39.862
He did?

04:40.822 --> 04:41.823
That's great.

04:41.823 --> 04:45.952
Yoo-hoo! Carpool's arrived.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.453
Do you like my tiara?

04:47.453 --> 04:50.957
It is my birthday tiara
and I'm going to wear it all day

04:50.957 --> 04:53.126
even at my Manhattan spa party.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.544
Are you as excited as I am?

04:54.544 --> 04:58.339
Caroline, I am so sorry,
I don't think I'll be able to make it.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.925
It's been a crazy few days.

05:00.925 --> 05:04.512
Well, Hudson, why don't you
go jump in the car with Hannah,

05:04.512 --> 05:06.389
and I will be right there.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.307
Okay.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.309
- Bye.
- Bye, sweetheart.

05:14.063 --> 05:17.025
I know what happened
with Cooper and Trina.

05:17.025 --> 05:22.697
And I think that you and Trina need to
talk it out in a relaxed environment.

05:23.281 --> 05:24.657
Like a spa.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.618
- No.
- You can't avoid each other forever.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.203
Not in Greenwich, anyway.

05:29.954 --> 05:32.665
Besides... it's my birthday

05:32.665 --> 05:35.543
and I want my two besties
there to celebrate me.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.088
Pretty, pretty, pretty, please.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.298
Okay, fine.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.215
Yay!

05:41.758 --> 05:45.928
Oh, P.S., I saw the news this morning
about your sexy ex.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.181
It's so sad what's happening to him.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.515
What are you talking about?

05:49.515 --> 05:50.767
The lawsuit.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.018
What?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.227
Oh.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.693
I mean, at least it's a nice picture.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.613
He is so photogenic.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.788
Sash, what's with the getup?

06:12.538 --> 06:15.708
This is what it's like when you're
top of Twitter's 10 Most Hated.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.753
One second I'm talking
about Kam's magic penis

06:18.753 --> 06:20.505
and the next, I'm anti-feminist?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.548
It's ridiculous but it'll blow over.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.343
- It's a 60-second news cycle these days.
- Yeah.

06:25.343 --> 06:29.680
And, hey, at least
I'm not being sued for $450 million.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.973
Oh, my God. Right?

06:30.973 --> 06:32.558
I still can't believe it.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.604
I mean, I'm sure Brad's totally innocent.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.356
Of course you think that.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.692
Brad loved his artists like family.
He would never steal from them.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.779
Even that article
said it was that guy, Ron Shelby,

06:44.779 --> 06:47.156
who did the actual embezzling.
Do you remember him?

06:47.156 --> 06:50.785
I always had a bad feeling about him.
I even told Brad that when he hired him.

06:50.785 --> 06:54.747
Plus, he shaved his arms.
Never trust a man who shaves his arms.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.290
Brad must be devastated.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.376
I wish there was something I could do.

06:58.376 --> 07:01.379
Uh, yeah, that definitely falls
under the category of--

07:01.379 --> 07:03.172
Not my sink, not my dishes?

07:03.172 --> 07:05.216
I was gonna say,
not your garden, not your weeds,

07:05.216 --> 07:06.676
but same thing.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.718
I know.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.388
Maybe I should reach out to him.

07:10.388 --> 07:15.268
Do you not remember how hard it was
seeing him and his wife at Majid's party?

07:15.268 --> 07:18.813
I really think
I have to put all that stuff to the side.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.775
That business is cutthroat.
People can turn on you in a second.

07:22.775 --> 07:27.363
You know, he probably
needs a friend right now.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.073
You're gonna be his friend?

07:29.073 --> 07:30.450
He'd do it for me.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.120
And he would do it for you too, Sash.
You know that.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.413
Okay, fine.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.542
Are you sure you
aren't wanting to reach out to Brad

07:39.542 --> 07:41.461
'cause you're in a bad place with Majid?

07:42.170 --> 07:43.838
We're not in a bad place.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.090
We're in no place.

07:46.090 --> 07:49.302
He hasn't reached out since the party
and neither have I.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.387
I haven't even had time to think about it.

07:51.387 --> 07:54.307
- This is my first day back in the city.
- I know.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.517
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

07:56.517 --> 08:01.481
But me reaching out to Brad
has nothing to do with Majid.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.609
I'm gonna text him.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.824
Hey.

08:12.575 --> 08:13.618
Hey.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.620
Do you want me
to cancel my shoot and stay?

08:16.787 --> 08:19.373
I'm happy to.
I want to support you in any way I can.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.834
It'll all be fine. I'm gonna beat this.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.044
Of course you are.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.714
You're Brad Simon,
you always come out on top.

08:33.971 --> 08:34.805
What is it?

08:38.309 --> 08:39.894
It's nothing. Just...

08:40.853 --> 08:42.563
It's just one of the lawyers.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.485
Listen...

08:49.153 --> 08:51.656
I'm not just here
for the good times, okay?

08:52.281 --> 08:54.951
I want you to know
you can lean on me all the time.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.661
I'm your wife.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.086
Don't forget to eat.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.215
I won't.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.634
You have a good shoot, okay?

09:33.990 --> 09:34.824
Nothing.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.159
A least someone has good boundaries.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.747
Oh, wait. He's writing back.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.126
He wants to meet.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.460
Oh, for fuck's sake.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.920
I have to be there for him.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.839
It's the right thing to do.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.439
His loft.

10:08.149 --> 10:08.983
You know what?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.820
I have enough of a clusterfuck of my own
to deal with today.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.406
Have fun being Brad's friend.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.034
I'm sure that's gonna be
super easy for you.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.473
Thanks for coming.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.269
- For reaching out.
- Of course. Yeah.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.856
Where's, um, Gigi?

10:49.690 --> 10:50.524
She's...

10:51.859 --> 10:53.235
She's on a shoot.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.572
Do you want a coffee?

10:56.572 --> 10:57.490
- Sure.
- Yeah.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.616
Yeah.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.936
You have a new couch.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.355
It's pink.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.399
It's blush.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.859
I was assured of that.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.571
And you're a Buddhist now.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.324
Uh, Gigi got it.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.451
She's made a few changes here.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.121
I can see that.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.168
Thank you.

11:54.463 --> 11:55.339
You wanna sit?

11:55.339 --> 11:57.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:08.018 --> 12:11.105
You were the first person I wanted to call
when it all happened.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.443
You always warned me about Ron.

12:17.528 --> 12:19.238
I really fucked up. I...

12:21.073 --> 12:23.701
I wasn't overseeing the day-to-day
the way I should have.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.120
I knew Ron was tough...

12:27.913 --> 12:30.291
but I had no idea he was stealing.
I swear.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.876
Of course you didn't.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.753
I should've listened to you.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.176
You've always known what's good for me.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.761
Before I know it myself.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.266
I'm always coming around too late.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.439
I think I'm gonna lose the company.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.569
I don't know who I am without it.

12:59.778 --> 13:00.613
Brad...

13:02.448 --> 13:04.241
You are not your company.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.163
I know how much it means to you
and meant to you for your dad.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.999
But you made all that right
before he passed.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.793
There is so much more to you
than your success.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.088
I'm about to be a father, Billie.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.092
And I'm scared to death.

13:24.136 --> 13:24.970
The money...

13:25.971 --> 13:29.225
was the one thing
I knew I had going for me.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.310
You know?

13:32.353 --> 13:34.146
I knew, if nothing else, I...

13:38.859 --> 13:40.486
I could provide for my son.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.030
But now...

13:46.492 --> 13:48.577
You're gonna be a great father.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.456
I've always known that.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.169
Whether it happened with us or with Gigi.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.800
That little boy is lucky...

14:03.509 --> 14:05.052
to have you as his dad.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.306
You don't want to do this.

14:53.934 --> 14:54.810
Maybe I do.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.401
Well, I don't.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.825
I can't.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.915
You've always been right about me too.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.337
This isn't who I am, who I want to be.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.632
This is not who you are either.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.482
Hello, Mick.

15:43.692 --> 15:44.652
Oh.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.445
I'm sorry.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.864
Your assistant said you wanted to meet.

15:48.864 --> 15:49.782
Sit down.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.245
As I predicted,
your brand is bleeding out.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.457
Got a Dr. Evans problem
you got to fix, stat.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.210
I know, but I'm sure
it's all gonna blow over.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.880
It's a 60-second news cycle
these days, right?

16:04.880 --> 16:08.842
Besides, I have been
preparing some inspired

16:08.842 --> 16:12.596
hashtag "IndependentWoman4Life" posts
that are gonna slay.

16:13.555 --> 16:16.850
Not gonna cut it.
This is your personal Chernobyl.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.812
You need to put on your hazmat suit
and clean this shit up.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.357
You're writing a book called <i>Unattached.</i>
You gotta be unattached.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.525
Okay, I hear you.

16:24.525 --> 16:28.362
But here's another idea just to chew on.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.947
What if I push back,

16:29.947 --> 16:34.368
make Kam eat a little crow
so that we're reframing the issue to:

16:34.368 --> 16:37.579
"Sasha Snow has got her man in check."

16:39.289 --> 16:41.125
- It's good.
- It's shit.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.835
Independent Woman for Life

16:42.835 --> 16:47.006
rehabs some douchebag who shuts her up
in front of 4 million viewers?

16:47.006 --> 16:51.468
Okay. That hand-over-mouth thing
was taken way out of context.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.178
We were just joking around.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.014
We're done.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.982
Perception... is reality.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.236
I was just on the phone
with <i>Goop Lab's</i> executive producer

17:09.236 --> 17:11.447
pitching you for a regular segment.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.242
She was practically
creaming her panties over the idea.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.827
Oh, my God.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.039
That's amazing.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.624
Yeah, well, it's only a dress rehearsal.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.919
You could be Gwyneth's Dr. Phil...

17:26.920 --> 17:28.756
but you gotta do things my way.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.340
I'm an independent woman.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.135
Isn't it my job to question you?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.431
Sally, get me Amanda Gorman on the phone.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.310
I was just playing.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.564
I really wanna make this work.

17:46.398 --> 17:47.983
Then 86 the boyfriend.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.402
-  <i>I have Amanda.</i>
- Amanda.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.155
Poet! Renaissance woman of the century!

17:53.155 --> 17:54.656
You ever hear of Goop?

17:59.244 --> 18:00.370
Billie.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.914
I'm so sorry I'm late.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.833
I just-- I got held up at, uh, school.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.965
Well, all that matters is you're here now

18:13.258 --> 18:16.303
and I scheduled some
amazing spa treatments for us,

18:16.303 --> 18:21.266
including massages with
my favorite masseur of all time, Sven.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.477
- Oh!
- That's his real name.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.062
Wow. Can't wait.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.482
Caroline, I have your room ready.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.150
- Just how you like it.
- Great.

18:31.318 --> 18:35.739
He knows I love a warm massage table
with a couple drops of eucalyptus oil.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.242
See you later.

18:40.911 --> 18:41.745
Billie...

18:43.455 --> 18:44.665
I'm so sorry.

18:45.624 --> 18:47.459
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I know.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.464
- I just--
-  Billie and Trina?

18:52.464 --> 18:54.716
Hi. I'm Helen,

18:54.716 --> 18:58.637
and I am taking you for your
restorative couple's seaweed wrap.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.348
Oh, no, no, no, no. We're not a couple.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.853
This is a judgment free space. Follow me.

19:10.149 --> 19:10.983
Hey, Ben.

19:10.983 --> 19:16.071
Sorry, Cooper, but I have instructions
from Francesca not to let you up.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.995
Could you please call her
and let her know I'm here?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.372
Don't you want to call her yourself?

19:27.457 --> 19:29.168
I think it'll be better if you do it.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.551
Now, hand me your robes.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.431
Ladies, we're all women of the earth here

19:43.015 --> 19:46.810
and shedding our cloaks
is part of the cleansing process. Just...

19:47.436 --> 19:52.274
Good. Very good. Thank you.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.193
Now, take the seaweed.

19:54.193 --> 19:59.656
Go ahead. Take it and gently rub it
onto the front of your bodies.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.368
Very good. Yes, Just like that.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.455
And make sure to cover all the areas.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.625
Really feel the curative effects
of that seaweed

20:09.625 --> 20:12.878
as it draws out those toxins

20:12.878 --> 20:16.965
and releases all of that negative energy.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.385
Release that energy. Release!

20:25.557 --> 20:27.893
I want you to do each other's backs.

20:27.893 --> 20:28.894
That's okay.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.188
I have really long arms, I can reach.

20:31.188 --> 20:35.984
No, no, no. Open yourselves up
to each other's restorative touch.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.738
Hmm? I'll be back in a few minutes.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.205
Is it okay to use
my restorative touch on you?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.207
I hear it works wonders.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.254
Honestly, it'll help
if I don't have to look you in the eye

20:55.254 --> 20:57.130
when I say what I have to say to you.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.635
Have at it.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.518
I am so truly sorry...

21:10.477 --> 21:11.311
and...

21:12.854 --> 21:13.689
ashamed...

21:14.773 --> 21:16.441
of what happened with Cooper

21:17.109 --> 21:18.443
and especially Hudson.

21:18.443 --> 21:19.486
Is he okay?

21:21.405 --> 21:24.032
We convinced him
you two were playing a game.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.327
He's young enough that he bought it.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.372
I'm really glad.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.585
What I did was not to hurt you.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.838
I need you to know that.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.382
I've just been...

21:42.759 --> 21:47.139
so envious of you for having the guts
to go after your own happiness

21:47.139 --> 21:51.059
when I don't even have the foggiest idea
what would make me happy.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.603
What are you talking about?

21:55.897 --> 21:59.526
Turns out the sex parties
were just a distraction

21:59.526 --> 22:01.611
from what was happening in my marriage...

22:03.196 --> 22:04.865
or what wasn't happening.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.328
I tried going back to work. Like you.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.166
Honestly, I'm grasping at straws,

22:14.166 --> 22:16.335
and Cooper was one of those straws.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.545
Trina.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.257
You should not be envious of me.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.427
I don't have anything figured out.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.720
Not by a mile.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.430
You made such bold choices.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.016
You didn't just stay silent,

22:31.016 --> 22:32.642
do what we're all supposed to do,

22:32.642 --> 22:34.853
keep our mouths shut and act grateful.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.899
You can make bold choices too, you know.

22:40.484 --> 22:44.946
And I will be here
to help you in any way that I can.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.408
Okay, ladies.

22:48.408 --> 22:52.287
Are we ready to rinse
all that negative energy away?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.832
Yes, Helen. Let's rinse that shit away.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.588
Cooper.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.757
Here's your shit. We're done.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.052
What the hell is he doing here?
The receptionist's not enough for you?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.971
Got big cojones coming at me
given what you did with my wife.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.599
I called Devon after you went MIA.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.060
I called everyone
because I thought you were dead.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.772
But after the earful I got from him,
you may as well be.

23:18.772 --> 23:22.692
- Can we talk in private? Just you and me.
- No, he stays.

23:24.027 --> 23:27.489
I want you to be humiliated
the same way you humiliated me.

23:30.117 --> 23:30.951
Okay.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.203
I'm sorry.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.667
I jumped in with both feet too soon

23:38.667 --> 23:42.504
and I hadn't processed all of
the unresolved baggage with Billie and me.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.506
And I'm sorry
you got caught in the middle.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.507
In the middle?

23:48.593 --> 23:50.762
I thought we were
building a life together.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.973
I lost my job because of you.

23:52.973 --> 23:56.852
Now I'm unhireable because
you made me the whore of Wall Street.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.980
I'm so sorry, Francesca.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.654
The truth is, it wasn't just Trina.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.073
There were others.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.285
There was a woman
at the Chinese restaurant.

24:14.828 --> 24:15.912
Oh, my God.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.664
My Uber driver last night.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.291
Dude.

24:19.291 --> 24:23.378
I'm just... I'm fucked up right now. Okay?

24:23.378 --> 24:26.214
I used to think Billie was the problem
in your marriage,

24:26.214 --> 24:27.841
but maybe I had it wrong.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.385
Maybe the problem is you.

24:30.969 --> 24:34.431
- So, what can I do to make it right?
- You could've talked to me.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.309
You could've told me
any part of what was going on.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.936
But you did nothing. You said nothing.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.856
This is private property.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.193
Take your shit and get out.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.530
Francesca, wait.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.972
I feel like a new woman.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.685
How was your seaweed wrap?
You and Trina make up?

25:21.728 --> 25:22.562
Yeah.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.439
I think we did.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.774
- Yay!
- Mm-hm.

25:26.441 --> 25:29.069
I knew Helen would clear out
all of that bad energy.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.321
She is very insistent about that.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.489
Mm.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.367
So...

25:36.868 --> 25:39.162
have you talked to bad boy Brad
about the lawsuit?

25:40.288 --> 25:41.998
No. Why would I?

25:41.998 --> 25:43.750
- We're not together.
- I know.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.753
But you never said why you're not.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.047
Brad had such a pull on you.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.049
I was so excited for what might happen.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.010
I used to lie in bed thinking about
what your life was like now.

25:54.010 --> 25:56.721
- Let me tell you--
-  What the hell, Caroline.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.975
Your sick fuck of a masseur, Sven,
just tried to go down on me.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.518
- What?
- Are you serious?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.937
Yeah. I'm about to go report
his ass to management.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.940
- No, no, no, you can't.
- Why not?

26:06.940 --> 26:09.526
Did he try something on you too, Caroline?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.239
Uh...

26:14.823 --> 26:16.324
Okay, um...

26:18.201 --> 26:20.620
Yes, he did.

26:20.620 --> 26:23.164
And I let him.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.793
In fact, I let him about once a month.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.796
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.090
I didn't realize
he was doing that with everyone.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.259
I thought it was our special thing.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.637
He probably thought he was doing
you a favor like he has been for me.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.641
Okay, Caroline, I don't understand.

26:41.641 --> 26:44.352
You always seemed
so happy in your marriage.

26:44.352 --> 26:47.856
I am happy. I love Jeffrey.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.483
But you said
I need to start questioning my life.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.235
Oh, my God. So this is on me now?

26:52.235 --> 26:56.072
No. I was inspired...
to figure out why I don't like sex.

26:56.072 --> 26:59.743
Well, it turns out I do like sex.
I like sex a lot.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.412
Just not with my husband.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.874
Please don't report him.

27:06.666 --> 27:09.002
Don't ruin this for me.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.922
<i>There's a delivery here</i>

27:12.922 --> 27:14.299
<i>that requires your signature.</i>

27:15.717 --> 27:16.676
Send him in.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.641
Special delivery for Dr. Evans.

27:33.151 --> 27:37.364
<i>♪ I sit alone in dark places ♪</i>

27:37.364 --> 27:41.785
<i>♪ I speak half-truths to total strangers ♪</i>

27:41.785 --> 27:45.830
<i>♪ I fake smile through conversation ♪</i>

27:46.748 --> 27:48.875
<i>♪ Since I left you... ♪</i>

27:48.875 --> 27:51.961
I was told a signature would be required.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.007
I'm certain you'll leave your signature.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.634
All...

27:59.803 --> 28:00.678
over...

28:01.179 --> 28:02.263
me.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.413
You know these walls are paper thin.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.166
Then you better not scream too loud.

28:36.464 --> 28:38.633
Have fun being a patient, Dr. Evans.

28:47.142 --> 28:50.478
Well, the scent of eucalyptus
is forever ruined for me.

28:50.478 --> 28:53.064
Oh, he gave you the eucalyptus too?

28:54.524 --> 28:55.942
Listen, um...

28:56.651 --> 29:02.490
I know on some level
I should be... flattered.

29:02.490 --> 29:05.702
I mean, you both are making
some really big decisions

29:05.702 --> 29:09.706
based on... me and my life choices, but...

29:11.374 --> 29:13.126
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.210
Why not?

29:17.422 --> 29:19.090
I did go see Brad today.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.011
- Did something happen?
- It almost did.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.513
I wanted it to.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.099
But...

29:30.518 --> 29:32.771
- I have a boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.105
That's so exciting.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.817
Well, I mean,
things are a little weird right now.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.319
Because you still love Brad?

29:39.944 --> 29:40.904
Brad is married.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.282
He and his wife are about to have a baby.

29:44.282 --> 29:47.035
No. That's so sad.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.246
I mean, happy for them.
A child is a blessing.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.539
But sad for you...

29:53.124 --> 29:54.626
- and also me.

29:57.670 --> 29:59.923
- Oh, shit.
-  What's wrong?

29:59.923 --> 30:00.840
Who is it?

30:02.926 --> 30:04.511
Brad's wife.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.599
I know the last few days
have been rough,

30:09.599 --> 30:13.019
but I'm happy to report
you still got your swagger.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.940
But speaking of which,

30:18.233 --> 30:22.654
Mick called me in to discuss
how to stop the hemorrhaging.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.322
Like a Twitter tourniquet.

30:25.365 --> 30:29.953
Actually, we decided
I should break up with you.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.164
- Publicly.
- You're breaking up with me?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.959
No, of course not.

30:36.584 --> 30:39.796
We can keep seeing each other
just in private.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.172
In secret?

30:41.172 --> 30:45.885
Hey, secrecy... can be really hot.

30:45.885 --> 30:48.429
Oh, my God.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.016
That's why you came and seduced me.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.978
To soften me up before lowering the boom.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.563
That's not what this is.

30:56.563 --> 31:00.817
No, this is you sacrificing
your integrity for your brand.

31:03.444 --> 31:07.282
I have to do whatever it takes
to expand my platform,

31:07.282 --> 31:09.659
to teach women to fight back
against the patriarchy

31:09.659 --> 31:11.744
and live the way they want to.
You know that.

31:11.744 --> 31:12.954
Whatever it takes, huh?

31:12.954 --> 31:15.123
My next book is called <i>Unattached.</i>

31:15.123 --> 31:17.125
Your agent came up with that title,
not you.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.712
It's a good fucking title
because it describes who I am,

31:20.712 --> 31:24.549
who I've been for the last 17 years
before you showed up again.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.551
But it's not who you are now.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.095
Like it or not, you have a partner.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.138
As of last week,

31:30.138 --> 31:33.433
you were telling me how sustained you felt
by that partnership.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.227
- Why don't you tell that to your fans?
- I will.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.022
My next book can be about that.
I can be honest then.

31:40.481 --> 31:41.482
Sasha, look around.

31:41.482 --> 31:46.362
My whole career has been built
on living a life of integrity.

31:46.362 --> 31:49.616
How could you possibly expect me to cosign

31:49.616 --> 31:52.577
on selling some bullshit reality?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.953
Oh, I see.

31:53.953 --> 31:54.913
We're back to that.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.041
Your career,
which always comes before mine.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.208
Mm-mm. Stop.

32:00.376 --> 32:04.380
That is not what this is.
I'm just not gonna live a lie.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.634
I love you, Sasha Snow.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.305
But you've got a decision to make.

32:20.813 --> 32:22.482
Elongate your torso.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.818
All right. Chin up.
Yes. A little to the right.

32:25.818 --> 32:26.778
Little to the left.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.321
Beautiful. Okay.

32:28.321 --> 32:31.032
Chin down a tiny bit.
Straight into the lens.

32:31.032 --> 32:33.034
Right. Love that.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.578
All right, legs up. Arch your back.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.207
You're exquisite.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.672
Sorry, Nino, I need ten.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.589
Okay.

32:58.726 --> 33:02.605
Gigi, wow. You're gorgeous.

33:02.605 --> 33:04.857
I know you were at the loft earlier.

33:05.942 --> 33:09.320
I get notifications on my phone with
camera footage when someone buzzes up.

33:10.571 --> 33:12.281
What were you doing there?

33:12.281 --> 33:15.034
Oh, I just reached out
when I heard the news.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.828
I wanted to make sure Brad was okay.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.997
And then he asked you
to come over to our home,

33:18.997 --> 33:21.082
that I'm getting ready for our baby.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.834
As a friend.

33:29.632 --> 33:33.052
You are the ghost in our relationship
and I think you always will be.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.137
No, Gigi.

33:34.137 --> 33:36.431
I only recently put it together
but I get it now.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.183
You left your husband.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.269
But by that time,
Brad was already with me.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.897
So the only reason
you two aren't together is this baby.

33:44.897 --> 33:45.940
That's not true.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.819
Brad loves you.
That has never been a question.

33:49.819 --> 33:50.903
I'm not an idiot.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.282
I saw you both at the party.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.868
How affected you were by each other.

33:57.744 --> 34:00.121
I asked Brad not to contact you again.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.623
But he couldn't help himself.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.708
Look...

34:04.917 --> 34:06.669
Brad is going through a lot.

34:06.669 --> 34:07.754
Oh, I'm aware.

34:08.921 --> 34:10.423
And you have no idea how it feels

34:10.423 --> 34:13.217
to know that you're the one
he wants to talk to about this.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.972
Shit. I can't fuck this up,
it's a $10,000 makeup job.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.183
No, no. Okay, hold on.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.352
Here you go.

34:34.322 --> 34:35.865
You've had your chance.

34:37.950 --> 34:38.993
Now it's my turn.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.330
Please, let me have it.

35:02.475 --> 35:03.351
Hey, Olga.

35:03.351 --> 35:07.271
Hey, I was just calling to see
how much longer you're going to be.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.900
Hudson says you're going sledding
and getting hot chocolate.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.111
Oh... shit.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.153
<i>I got, um...</i>

35:14.987 --> 35:18.574
I got stuck at work
and I lost track of time.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.454
Daddy says he's so sorry.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.581
He loves you
and he'll see you in the morning.

35:25.581 --> 35:27.917
Yeah, that.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.588
Thank you, Olga.

35:40.429 --> 35:42.265
I'll take another one, please.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.475
Sorry, man. I gotta cut you off.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.685
Happy to call you a cab.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.897
I don't need a fucking cab.
I just need another drink.

35:50.815 --> 35:51.691
Not my rules.

35:56.070 --> 35:56.904
Okay.

35:59.031 --> 36:01.784
Your job is to pour.

36:01.784 --> 36:03.536
So, pour.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.539
Do your fucking job.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.293
You want me to come back there
and show you how to do it?

36:10.293 --> 36:11.711
Cooper.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.964
Emily?

36:18.676 --> 36:19.886
What are you doing here?

36:19.886 --> 36:23.890
I was getting drinks with some colleagues
and I saw you.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.183
Oh.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.019
Here, sit down.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.061
Sit down.

36:29.061 --> 36:31.439
Maybe you can get this guy
to get us a drink.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.024
I can only stay a moment.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.236
I heard you're getting divorced.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.032
Oh.

36:41.532 --> 36:42.366
Yep.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.535
That's me.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.872
- Mr. Failed Marriage.
- Don't do that to yourself.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.583
No one ever tells you
how hard this part is.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.837
For months, my standing Postmates order

36:54.837 --> 36:57.089
was an avocado toast
and a fifth of Grey Goose.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.717
Plus a straw.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.220
Classy. I know.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.101
Going through a divorce
can make you doubt yourself,

37:09.101 --> 37:10.353
your choices.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.647
You start to feel like a fraud.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.899
Yeah. Except maybe I am.

37:16.859 --> 37:17.693
The fraud.

37:19.153 --> 37:22.531
I mean, the woman I've been seeing
would definitely agree.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.367
And Billie.

37:25.076 --> 37:27.495
Maybe they're both right.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.537
Maybe...

37:31.249 --> 37:34.543
Maybe I'm not the man
that I always thought I was.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.213
No.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.467
I've known you for a long time, Cooper.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.805
Long before there ever was a Billie,
let alone this other woman.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.724
I know your heart.

37:50.184 --> 37:52.728
I know who you are. And...

37:54.605 --> 37:56.482
I've always loved that man.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.285
No. Not like this.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.666
I know you'll find your way
back to yourself, but I can't.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.419
I can't be here for this part.

38:58.294 --> 38:59.128
Billie.

39:18.314 --> 39:20.483
How'd you know
I was a sucker for amaryllis?

39:20.483 --> 39:22.568
Did you think these were for you?

39:22.568 --> 39:24.070
I'm just selling these.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.113
Sir, care to buy some flowers?

39:30.618 --> 39:32.286
What are you doing here?

39:33.913 --> 39:35.081
Yeah. So...

39:37.708 --> 39:41.629
It actually took me a few days
to work up the courage to reach out.

39:42.922 --> 39:47.218
Considered just letting the whole thing go
rather than... confessing.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.221
It was like,
if I don't tell her, we're done.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.932
If I do tell her,
we're probably done anyway.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.141
Tell me what, Maj?

39:57.269 --> 39:58.562
You were right.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.190
You have been
unflinchingly honest with me,

40:01.190 --> 40:04.068
so I know I need to just man up
and do the same.

40:05.444 --> 40:08.030
Crystal was one of my original investors.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.201
I'd been scraping pennies together,
raising money for a long time,

40:12.201 --> 40:16.038
finally thought I had enough
to put a down payment on the space.

40:16.831 --> 40:20.668
But then in the 11th hour,
the last piece of financing fell apart.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.380
I didn't want to ask my family.

40:26.799 --> 40:27.633
I couldn't.

40:28.634 --> 40:29.468
So...

40:31.303 --> 40:33.389
A buddy introduced me to Crystal

40:33.389 --> 40:36.600
and she came through,
but there was a string attached.

40:39.645 --> 40:40.855
I have sex with her.

40:43.023 --> 40:46.193
That's... been the arrangement.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.696
I haven't been with her since I met you.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.906
I've been putting her off for months.

40:50.906 --> 40:54.618
But the other night at the restaurant,
I knew I had to talk to her.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.704
I shouldn't have let it
get as far as it did.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.999
But after you left,
I spoke to her and I drew the line.

40:59.999 --> 41:03.043
She is very clear on my boundaries now.

41:06.255 --> 41:09.008
So, I was hoping maybe you
could give me another chance.

41:15.055 --> 41:15.973
It's okay.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.517
I get it.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.315
I never would have forgiven myself
if I hadn't taken the chance. So...

41:30.488 --> 41:31.363
Wait.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.620
I know what it's like...

41:38.662 --> 41:40.915
to want something so much...

41:43.375 --> 41:46.086
you'll go after it,
no matter the consequences.

41:49.465 --> 41:51.592
I saw Brad today.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.429
I reached out under the...

41:56.597 --> 41:58.724
guise of concern about the lawsuit.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.142
But the truth is...

42:02.561 --> 42:03.854
I wanted to see him.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.108
Nothing happened.

42:11.904 --> 42:12.988
But it almost did.

42:14.031 --> 42:14.865
So...

42:15.533 --> 42:17.535
Look, we're both adults.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.497
We both have pasts.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.793
And it would be naive
to pretend that we didn't.

42:33.592 --> 42:34.969
Do you want to come up?

42:37.388 --> 42:38.389
Sure.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.725
As soon as I finish selling these flowers.

42:41.725 --> 42:42.977
Give me.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.288
What is it? There's lots happening here.
I've been buried.

43:02.288 --> 43:05.082
<i>This is the labor
and delivery nurse at Mount Sinai.</i>

43:05.082 --> 43:08.335
<i>Your wife's in active labor.
She's been trying to reach you.</i>

43:08.335 --> 43:10.796
<i>You should get here as soon as possible.</i>

43:12.756 --> 43:13.882
Oh, my God.

43:22.641 --> 43:24.143
I love you, Billie.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.853
I want to be everything to you.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.438
Tell me what you want.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.399
What you've never dared to say. Or do.

43:33.527 --> 43:34.361
Anything?

43:44.663 --> 43:46.040
Sasha, hi.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.709
- Hi.
- Where's Dr. Evans?

43:48.709 --> 43:50.252
Flying solo, Sangita.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.880
Well, there's been a lot
of Internet chatter

43:52.880 --> 43:54.923
about hashtag "TalkToTheHand."

43:54.923 --> 43:56.717
What do you have to say?

43:56.717 --> 44:01.430
What I'll say is sexism and misogyny
are so prevalent in our society,

44:01.430 --> 44:05.142
so internalized,
that even someone like me fell prey.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.729
I should've never
attributed my success to a man.

44:08.729 --> 44:11.857
The only person responsible
for my success is me.
