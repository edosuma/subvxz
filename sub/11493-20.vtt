00:02.937 --> 00:04.104
Billy called.

00:04.106 --> 00:05.738
Billy Stanhope?

00:05.740 --> 00:07.891
Yeah, he said he has
a business proposition for you.

00:07.893 --> 00:10.193
How 'bout that?

00:10.195 --> 00:12.962
Billy Stanhope...
(laughs)

00:17.585 --> 00:18.585
(screaming)

00:18.587 --> 00:20.153
(screams)

00:21.488 --> 00:22.822
What went down between you two?

00:22.824 --> 00:25.425
Well, we built Eddie's software
company in Bridget's garage

00:25.427 --> 00:27.460
and then sold it
for a couple billion dollars.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.179
That son of a bitch.

00:29.181 --> 00:30.513
He didn't want to sell.

00:30.515 --> 00:32.298
You really think we can finally
build the electric suitcase?

00:32.299 --> 00:33.833
Yes, we have the technology now.

00:33.835 --> 00:36.603
I-I just need you to help me
write the code.

00:36.605 --> 00:38.805
Hey, you know, while
we're on the subject...

00:38.807 --> 00:40.557
What? Peeing?
No, sex.

00:40.559 --> 00:42.308
There's something
you should know.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.726
It's about your ex-wife.

00:43.728 --> 00:44.944
What? Bridget?

00:44.946 --> 00:46.179
Yeah, I'm, uh...

00:46.181 --> 00:48.114
kind of sleeping with her.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.616
What?!
W-Wait, hey...

00:49.618 --> 00:50.817
Mom, this is Alan.

00:50.819 --> 00:52.518
Alan, this is
my mom, Jean.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.736
Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:53.738 --> 00:55.121
You know what?
Tell you what.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.023
I will call my mom
and try to set up a dinner.

00:57.025 --> 00:59.159
Evelyn says there's a place
right down the street

00:59.161 --> 01:00.877
where they have
music and dancing.

01:00.879 --> 01:02.528
Why don't you two
fuddy-duddies run along

01:02.530 --> 01:04.797
and let Jean and I
have some fun.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.700
You think we'll find some
cute fellas to dance with?

01:07.702 --> 01:09.636
Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean...

01:09.638 --> 01:11.721
we're not going to dance.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.423
I adore your mother.

01:13.425 --> 01:15.758
That's only because
you just met her.

01:15.760 --> 01:16.843
I don't know.

01:16.845 --> 01:19.145
I think I got
to know her pretty well.

01:19.147 --> 01:21.631
Good morning, darling.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.884
Hi, Peaches.

01:30.774 --> 01:33.026
♪ Men...♪

01:33.028 --> 01:35.612
Great. I'll pick you up
at the airport.

01:35.614 --> 01:37.330
I can't wait.

01:37.332 --> 01:38.948
I love you, too.

01:38.950 --> 01:40.450
Tell Zoey I said "hi."

01:40.452 --> 01:42.502
Oh, Alan says "hi."

01:42.504 --> 01:45.088
(quietly)
Yes, he's still here.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.259
Uh-huh. I know. You're right.

01:49.261 --> 01:51.427
She says "hi" back.

01:52.596 --> 01:53.930
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

01:53.932 --> 01:55.765
Here you go.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.250
Oh, thank you.

01:57.252 --> 01:59.018
You got to be excited about
having your girlfriend back.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.054
What has it been, a month?
Three weeks.

02:01.056 --> 02:03.890
Still, that's like
a decade in penis years.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.026
Yeah.

02:08.029 --> 02:10.280
Tell you the truth, I'm actually
a little bit worried.

02:10.282 --> 02:11.364
About your relationship?

02:11.366 --> 02:13.366
Come on. Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

02:13.368 --> 02:15.034
At least for guys like you.

02:15.036 --> 02:17.370
For guys like me,
absence is more often enforced

02:17.372 --> 02:19.289
by the state of California.

02:19.291 --> 02:22.441
Zoey doesn't know that I started
a new software company

02:22.443 --> 02:23.876
with my old partner.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.662
Yeah, with Billy, I know.
What's the big deal?

02:25.664 --> 02:27.830
Well, there's
a third partner...

02:27.832 --> 02:30.116
that Zoey's
not gonna like.

02:30.118 --> 02:32.001
Walden...

02:32.003 --> 02:33.753
you made me a partner?

02:34.722 --> 02:37.674
All I did was bring
you two guys together,

02:37.676 --> 02:39.359
The third partner is Bridget.

02:39.361 --> 02:40.593
Your ex-wife?

02:40.595 --> 02:42.812
Come on, I brought
you two guys together!

02:42.814 --> 02:44.681
But she helped me design
the original code

02:44.683 --> 02:46.766
for the software;
I had to bring her in.

02:46.768 --> 02:48.134
Oh, right, right.

02:48.136 --> 02:51.237
Well, I guess that would make
a very awkward conversation

02:51.239 --> 02:52.405
with Zoey.

02:52.407 --> 02:54.140
Yeah. I think I'm just gonna try

02:54.142 --> 02:55.908
to slip it in
without her noticing.

02:55.910 --> 02:58.278
Hmm. Story of my life.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.916
(sighs)

03:03.918 --> 03:05.501
Well, listen, just remember,

03:05.503 --> 03:07.954
that love will get you
through times of no money

03:07.956 --> 03:10.723
better than money will get you
through times of no love.

03:12.209 --> 03:13.459
That's good advice.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.493
Thank you.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.162
And, uh, just to be clear...

03:16.164 --> 03:17.380
uh, I have zero stake

03:17.382 --> 03:19.515
in this potential
billion-dollar business?

03:19.517 --> 03:21.351
Well, actually, I
was gonna give you

03:21.353 --> 03:23.269
a hundred shares
of founders' stock.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.454
Wow.

03:24.456 --> 03:26.139
If this thing works,
it could be worth millions.

03:26.141 --> 03:28.057
Thank you.

03:28.059 --> 03:29.642
My problem is I still
got to figure out

03:29.644 --> 03:30.943
how to explain this to Zoey.

03:30.945 --> 03:33.846
Dump the bitch. Don't let her
screw this up for us.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.618
Once again, thank you
for the advice.

03:38.620 --> 03:40.536
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

03:40.538 --> 03:43.373
I've got my own little
relationship problem brewing.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.326
Yeah, that doesn't
make me feel better.

03:46.328 --> 03:48.911
My girlfriend's mom and my mom

03:48.913 --> 03:52.115
have become lovers.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.085
(laughs): Okay, that does
make me feel better.

If we just had sex in England,

04:33.872 --> 04:35.205
would I be lying on

you been up to?

like, very, very busy.

04:51.973 --> 04:53.973

04:53.975 --> 04:55.508
I started a new

with my old partner
Billy Stanhope.

04:58.063 --> 04:59.145

Walden!

04:59.147 --> 05:00.513
Yeah.
That's terrific!

05:00.515 --> 05:01.614
It's amazing and, and

05:01.616 --> 05:03.066
we built this
amazing product.

05:03.068 --> 05:04.784
It's called
the electric suitcase.

05:04.786 --> 05:05.952
I-It's gonna completely
revolutionize

05:05.954 --> 05:07.821
the global energy market.

05:07.823 --> 05:09.072
Whoa. Sounds big.

05:09.074 --> 05:11.491
No, it's bigger than big.
I mean, the three of us

05:11.493 --> 05:13.460
could end up splitting
billions of dollars.

05:13.462 --> 05:14.744
The three of you?

05:14.746 --> 05:15.962
What?

05:15.964 --> 05:17.630
You just said
the three of you.

05:17.632 --> 05:20.967
Y-Yes, there are
in fact three of us.

05:20.969 --> 05:22.352
Who's the third?

05:22.354 --> 05:23.503
Oh, not Alan.

05:23.505 --> 05:26.339
(laughs)
No, God, no.

05:30.361 --> 05:32.345
So, who is it?

05:34.815 --> 05:36.549
It's Bridget.

05:36.551 --> 05:37.817
Your ex-wife?

05:37.819 --> 05:39.185
There's nothing I could do.

05:39.187 --> 05:41.354
I mean, she helped write the
original code for the software

05:41.356 --> 05:43.055
so she still owns
a third of it.

05:43.057 --> 05:44.891
So you've gone into
business with a woman

05:44.893 --> 05:46.910
who drove her car
into your living room

05:46.912 --> 05:48.328
because you chose me
over her?

05:48.330 --> 05:50.229
Crazy world, huh?

05:51.332 --> 05:52.866
On the plus side...

05:52.868 --> 05:54.868
s-she's sleeping with
my ex-partner. So...

05:54.870 --> 05:56.202
Why is that a plus side?

05:56.204 --> 05:58.421
B-Because she's with him,

05:58.423 --> 06:01.407
so you don't have to worry
about me and... her.

06:01.409 --> 06:02.972
I wasn't worried
about you and her.

06:02.974 --> 06:03.694
Good.

06:03.712 --> 06:05.461
Until just now.

06:06.514 --> 06:09.081
Why didn't you tell me
about this before we had sex?

06:09.083 --> 06:10.683
Do you want to have sex now?

06:10.685 --> 06:12.268
No!
That's why!

06:12.270 --> 06:13.686
I'm going home.

06:13.688 --> 06:14.754
Oh, come on, Zoey.

06:14.756 --> 06:16.556
Don't make a big deal
out of this.

06:16.558 --> 06:19.025
If I told you I was going into
business with my ex-husband

06:19.027 --> 06:20.760
would you consider it
a big deal?

06:20.762 --> 06:21.694
No, not at all.

06:21.696 --> 06:22.929
You're a liar.

06:24.782 --> 06:26.282
(groans)

06:26.284 --> 06:29.235
Life would be so much easier
if I dated dumb chicks.

06:29.237 --> 06:30.570
I heard that.

06:30.572 --> 06:33.239
It was a compliment.

06:36.544 --> 06:38.545
Here you go.

06:38.547 --> 06:39.862
Thank you. So..

06:39.864 --> 06:42.081
have you given any thought
as to what we're gonna do

06:42.083 --> 06:44.384
about our little...
mother situation?

06:44.386 --> 06:46.118
Golden Girls Gone Wild?

06:46.120 --> 06:49.255
Hey... what can we do?
They're grown woman.

06:49.257 --> 06:51.341
They've made
a lifestyle choice.

06:51.343 --> 06:53.292
I have no problem
with the lifestyle.

06:53.294 --> 06:54.928
I've tried the lifestyle.

06:54.930 --> 06:56.062
Really?! When?

06:56.064 --> 06:58.731
Who? College? Camp?

06:58.733 --> 07:00.934
Shut up, Alan.

07:00.936 --> 07:03.152
Sorry. Go ahead.

07:03.154 --> 07:05.321
How am I supposed to have
a relationship with you

07:05.323 --> 07:08.241
when your mother is clearly
taking sexual advantage of mine?

07:08.243 --> 07:09.525
H-Hang on a second.

07:09.527 --> 07:11.911
I don't think anyone is
taking advantage of anyone.

07:11.913 --> 07:13.246
You don't?

07:13.248 --> 07:15.498
A week ago my mother was living
in a retirement community

07:15.500 --> 07:16.699
playing golf
with her girlfriends

07:16.701 --> 07:18.317
and watching reruns
of <i>Cagney & Lacey.</i>

07:18.319 --> 07:19.335
Well, I don't know.

07:19.337 --> 07:20.620
Golf, <i>Cagney & Lacey...</i>

07:20.622 --> 07:23.256
Sounds like she was
already halfway there.

07:25.659 --> 07:27.560
Shut up, Alan.

07:28.161 --> 07:29.545
(both laughing)

07:29.547 --> 07:31.464
Oh, good, you're here.

07:31.466 --> 07:32.548
Mom!

07:32.550 --> 07:34.300
What have you done
to yourself?

07:34.302 --> 07:35.969
Evelyn took me shopping.

07:35.971 --> 07:37.270
Do you like my new look?

07:37.272 --> 07:38.471
Isn't she gorgeous?

07:38.473 --> 07:40.106
Yeah, I-I guess.

07:40.108 --> 07:42.925
We also got matching tattoos.

07:44.395 --> 07:45.561
Oh, Mom, no.

07:45.563 --> 07:47.614
See? It's
a little heart.

07:47.616 --> 07:50.233
Uh, with an
"E plus J" in it.

07:50.235 --> 07:52.351
I don't see one
on your ankle, Mom.

07:52.353 --> 07:55.021
It's not on my ankle.

07:56.356 --> 07:58.157
Oh, glory-oski.

08:00.027 --> 08:01.360
Mom, you've been gone all day.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.713
I thought you and I were gonna
spend some time together

08:03.715 --> 08:05.331
before you went back
to Sunset Village.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.250
I know.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

08:07.252 --> 08:08.835
We've been so busy.

08:08.837 --> 08:10.036
But don't worry.

08:10.038 --> 08:11.971
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more of me

08:11.973 --> 08:14.273
after I move in with Evy.

08:17.377 --> 08:18.878
What?

08:18.880 --> 08:20.146
I've got this huge place.

08:20.148 --> 08:22.048
Why shouldn't she enjoy it?

08:22.050 --> 08:24.734
You're talking about
your huge house, right?

08:26.103 --> 08:28.187
We're just gonna pick up
some things here

08:28.189 --> 08:30.273
and then go close up
Jean's condo.

08:30.275 --> 08:32.241
And then we'll start
our new life,

08:32.243 --> 08:34.226
right, Peaches?
That's right, Pumpkin.

08:34.227 --> 08:35.845
Come on.

08:38.849 --> 08:41.868
This sort of makes you
brother and sister, doesn't it?

08:47.007 --> 08:50.493

All right, obviously,

Walden and I were

12:32.929 --> 12:34.195
together for many, many years,

12:34.197 --> 12:37.231
and you and he have been dating
for a few months now,

about us working together.

12:40.153 --> 12:41.102
I am not insecure.

12:41.104 --> 12:42.403
Right, and there's no reason

12:42.405 --> 12:44.155
you should be. Yes,

12:44.157 --> 12:46.074
I've known this guy
since high school,

12:46.076 --> 12:47.492
and yes, we fell in love,

12:47.494 --> 12:50.128
and yes, we spent
many happy years together,

12:50.130 --> 12:54.332
but the reality now is,
we're simply business partners.

12:54.334 --> 12:55.783
Right.

12:55.785 --> 12:58.119
And not all those years
were happy.

13:01.140 --> 13:03.341

some great times.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.393

some bad times.

13:08.264 --> 13:09.564
Also some bad times.

13:09.566 --> 13:11.682
I mean, the point is,

13:11.684 --> 13:14.986
is that our relationship now
is just strictly business.

13:14.988 --> 13:17.588
Oh, speaking of which, we need
to upgrade the ventilation

13:17.590 --> 13:18.773

13:18.775 --> 13:20.108
Oh, that's a good idea.

13:20.110 --> 13:21.993
Oh, also, I want to build
triple redundancy.

13:21.995 --> 13:24.278

talking shop

if we went our separate ways.

18:35.174 --> 18:37.308
Okay, that's one approach...

18:37.310 --> 18:39.810
which stinks.

18:39.812 --> 18:43.314
So, let me make
a counterproposal.

18:43.316 --> 18:45.632
Why don't you move in with me?

18:45.634 --> 18:48.185
What?

18:48.187 --> 18:50.020
Yeah, you and Ava
move in with me.

18:50.022 --> 18:52.440
I love you,
and I want you in my life,

18:52.442 --> 18:54.859
I want... I want
to have a future with you.

18:54.861 --> 18:57.144
Really?

18:57.146 --> 18:58.496
Really.

18:58.498 --> 19:00.948
AVA: Mummy, Mummy,
please say yes!

19:00.950 --> 19:04.118
What are you doing
out of bed?!

19:04.120 --> 19:07.121
I love you, Walden!

19:07.123 --> 19:09.156
I love you, Ava.

19:09.158 --> 19:11.825
Get back into bed!

19:11.827 --> 19:13.127
Hmm. Let's see.

19:13.129 --> 19:16.514
So, that's one vote for yes,
and I vote yes,

19:16.516 --> 19:19.216
so, the motion is passed.

19:19.218 --> 19:22.603
There is one
tiny little problem.

19:22.605 --> 19:23.604
What's that?

19:23.606 --> 19:25.973
If Ava and I move in,

19:25.975 --> 19:29.844
isn't somebody going
to have to move out?

19:30.662 --> 19:33.447
Hmm.

19:34.699 --> 19:36.233
(groans)

19:36.235 --> 19:38.352
What's the matter?
I don't know.

19:38.354 --> 19:41.539
Just felt a little shiver
go down my spine.

19:41.541 --> 19:43.707
(groans)

19:45.000 --> 19:51.074

19:53.768 --> 19:55.818
Here you go.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.653
I got to ask.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.522
What's with the tea?

19:59.524 --> 20:01.474
You make it for me.
You make it for Lyndsey.

20:01.476 --> 20:02.942
Well, I've got
a little philosophy.

20:02.944 --> 20:04.077
When someone's nice enough

20:04.079 --> 20:06.279
to let me into their home
or their pants,

20:06.281 --> 20:07.613
I like to show my appreciation.

20:07.615 --> 20:09.282
Without spending
any money.

20:09.284 --> 20:11.817
You know me so well.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.453
So, recap.

20:13.455 --> 20:14.704
How'd your dinner go?

20:14.706 --> 20:15.955
Oh, pretty well, actually.

20:15.957 --> 20:17.757
The grandmas were
on their best behavior,

20:17.759 --> 20:19.876
and the two boys--
well, let's just say,

20:19.878 --> 20:23.513
they're gonna be living with us
for a long, long time. And you?

20:23.515 --> 20:25.598
Oh, good, good.
It went really good.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.017
So, everything's okay with Zoey?
Yeah, it's fantastic.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.686
Sounds like everything's great
with you and Lyndsey, huh?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.305
Oh, yeah, more than good.

20:32.307 --> 20:34.474
Oh, forgot the honey.

20:36.477 --> 20:38.444
She owns her own home, right?

20:38.446 --> 20:39.779
Yeah.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.697
(groans)

20:41.699 --> 20:44.984
Hmm. Think I may be coming down
with something.
