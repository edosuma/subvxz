00:04.069 --> 00:05.980
At the health club,
people are working out...

00:06.149 --> 00:08.026
...and they're training,
getting in shape...

00:08.189 --> 00:12.068
...but strangely, nobody's really
getting in shape for anything.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.948
The only reason that you're
getting in shape...

00:15.109 --> 00:17.623
...is that so you can get through
the workout.

00:18.909 --> 00:20.945
So we're working out...

00:21.109 --> 00:25.421
...so that we'll be in shape
for when we have to do our exercise.

00:25.909 --> 00:27.422
This is the whole thing.

00:27.589 --> 00:30.183
The other thing I don't get
is why we're so careful...

00:30.349 --> 00:34.308
...about locking up our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

00:34.909 --> 00:40.859
What exactly is the black market
on these disgusting gym clothes?

00:41.029 --> 00:43.384
I'll give my car to any guy
in front of a restaurant...

00:43.549 --> 00:45.824
...because he's got a short
red jacket.

00:45.989 --> 00:47.388
"He must be the valet guy."

00:47.549 --> 00:49.824
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes...

00:49.989 --> 00:51.741
...I got one of these locks...

00:51.909 --> 00:54.548
...you could put a bullet through it
and it won't open.

00:54.709 --> 00:56.188
That stuff is safe.

01:01.909 --> 01:04.298
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.425
I had three inches on that guy.

01:06.589 --> 01:08.147
See, you two were hogging the ball.

01:08.309 --> 01:10.425
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

01:10.589 --> 01:11.863
All you do is dribble.

01:12.029 --> 01:15.339
I have to dribble. If I give it to you,
you just shoot. You're a chucker.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.908
- Oh, I'm a chucker.
- That's right.

01:17.069 --> 01:18.787
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

01:18.949 --> 01:20.177
I can't believe you
called me a chucker.

01:20.349 --> 01:22.783
No way I'm a chucker! I do not chuck.
Never chuck!

01:22.949 --> 01:25.668
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck! No chuck!

01:26.549 --> 01:28.062
You chuck.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.542
- Kramer, am I a chucker?
- Oh, you're a chucker.

01:32.829 --> 01:34.706
My God, I'm a chucker.

01:34.869 --> 01:39.340
- All these years, you never told me?
- It's not an easy thing to bring up.

01:40.829 --> 01:44.060
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

01:46.869 --> 01:48.621
Believe me, I didn't see anything.

01:48.789 --> 01:50.507
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

01:51.349 --> 01:53.783
- No. Did you?
- Yeah, I snuck a peek.

01:53.949 --> 01:56.144
- Why?
- Why not?

01:56.309 --> 01:57.628
What about you, George?

01:59.389 --> 02:00.708
Yeah, I...

02:01.829 --> 02:03.387
...snuck a peek.

02:03.549 --> 02:06.939
But it was so fast, I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

02:07.109 --> 02:08.701
I made a conscious effort not to look.

02:08.869 --> 02:11.099
There's certain information
I just don't wanna have.

02:11.669 --> 02:13.148
Okay...

02:13.669 --> 02:15.307
I gotta go meet Newman.

02:15.909 --> 02:18.548
- I'll see you later. Have a good one.
- All right.

02:19.349 --> 02:20.543
Yeah.

02:23.029 --> 02:24.348
Look at this guy.

02:25.029 --> 02:27.497
Does he have to stretch in here?

02:28.509 --> 02:29.737
- You know who that is?
- Who?

02:29.909 --> 02:31.422
That's Keith Hernandez.

02:32.349 --> 02:34.704
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

02:35.109 --> 02:36.940
Yeah, that's him.

02:37.109 --> 02:39.384
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

02:39.549 --> 02:42.302
Wow! Keith Hernandez!

02:42.469 --> 02:44.187
- He's such a great player.
- Yeah.

02:44.349 --> 02:46.544
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.348
Wow, I'd love to be a Civil War buff.

02:51.549 --> 02:53.904
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

02:54.709 --> 02:56.745
So Biff wants to be a buff?

02:57.269 --> 02:59.737
Well, sleeping less than 18 hours
a day would be a start.

03:03.189 --> 03:05.100
I only got two weeks left
of unemployment.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.147
I gotta prove I've been looking
for a job to get an extension.

03:08.949 --> 03:10.462
Hey, should we say something
to him?

03:10.629 --> 03:13.302
Oh, I'm sure he loves to hear
from fans in the locker room.

03:13.469 --> 03:15.664
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.226
He's Keith Hernandez.

03:18.389 --> 03:20.459
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

03:25.989 --> 03:27.820
- So?
- What, you're comparing yourself...

03:27.989 --> 03:29.308
...to Keith Hernandez?

03:29.469 --> 03:32.108
The guy's a baseball player,
Jerry, baseball!

03:32.269 --> 03:35.022
I know what he is. I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.

03:35.189 --> 03:38.067
What, you're making some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

03:39.709 --> 03:44.225
The guy was in game six, two runs
down, two outs, facing elimination!

03:44.389 --> 03:45.583
Excuse me.

03:45.749 --> 03:47.819
I don't want to disturb you.
I'm Keith Hernandez.

03:47.989 --> 03:51.106
And I just want to tell you what
a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

03:56.309 --> 03:58.459
- Really?
- I've always wanted to do what you do.

03:58.629 --> 04:01.587
Do what I do?! You're one
of my favorite ballplayers of all time!

04:01.749 --> 04:03.023
Mine too.

04:04.949 --> 04:07.907
- I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
- Really?

04:08.389 --> 04:10.027
Thank you.

04:11.109 --> 04:13.145
You know, Keith,
what I've always wondered is...

04:13.309 --> 04:15.903
...with all these ball clubs
flying around all season...

04:16.069 --> 04:18.629
...wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

04:23.789 --> 04:25.427
Are you performing in New York now?

04:25.589 --> 04:27.705
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.

04:27.869 --> 04:30.986
But think about it:
26 teams, 162 games a season.

04:31.149 --> 04:34.539
You'd think eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

04:37.829 --> 04:39.103
I live on the East Side.

04:39.269 --> 04:40.463
I'll give you my number...

04:40.629 --> 04:42.540
...and just tell me whenever
you want to go.

04:42.709 --> 04:45.348
- Or maybe just get together for coffee.
- Oh, that'd be great.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.703
Well, it's only a matter of time.

04:49.709 --> 04:51.427
Who's this chucker?

04:56.549 --> 04:59.109
It's been three days,
and he hasn't called.

04:59.389 --> 05:00.788
Well, maybe you should call him.

05:00.949 --> 05:02.541
I can't. I can't.

05:02.709 --> 05:06.224
- Why not?
- I just feel like he should call me.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.617
What's the difference?

05:07.789 --> 05:10.542
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.

05:10.709 --> 05:14.384
If he wants to see me,
he has my number. He should call.

05:16.389 --> 05:19.825
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.

05:20.589 --> 05:21.942
I can't stand these guys.

05:22.109 --> 05:24.703
You give your number to them,
and then they don't call.

05:26.069 --> 05:27.502
Why do they do that?

05:28.149 --> 05:29.787
I'm sorry, honey.

05:31.589 --> 05:34.547
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.700
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.588
- I know.
- Why did he come over to me?

05:39.749 --> 05:42.786
I mean, here I meet this great guy,
this ballplayer...

05:42.949 --> 05:44.860
...best guy I ever met.
- Yeah. I know.

05:45.029 --> 05:48.988
Well, that's it. I'm never giving
my number out to another guy again.

05:49.149 --> 05:53.142
I've given my number out to guys,
and it takes them a month to call.

05:54.389 --> 05:56.778
Good. Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month...

05:56.949 --> 05:58.780
...he's got a prayer.

06:00.829 --> 06:03.662
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.

06:03.829 --> 06:05.979
Oh, what, they don't have phones
out of town?

06:06.509 --> 06:08.943
I love how people say
they're too busy. "Too busy."

06:09.109 --> 06:11.100
Pick up a phone!

06:11.269 --> 06:13.908
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

06:14.389 --> 06:18.462
- Why don't you just go and call him?
- I can't call here. It's a coffee shop.

06:18.629 --> 06:22.144
- I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
- Just ask if he wants to get together.

06:22.629 --> 06:24.142
For what, dinner?

06:25.229 --> 06:26.708
Dinner's good.

06:27.229 --> 06:31.507
Don't you think that's coming on a little
too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff?

06:31.909 --> 06:34.218
Jerry, he's a guy.

06:36.469 --> 06:38.585
I know, but this is all very confusing.

06:38.949 --> 06:42.225
When you're in your 30s,
it's very hard to make a new friend.

06:42.389 --> 06:45.426
Whatever the group is you've got now,
that's who you're going with.

06:45.589 --> 06:48.103
You're not interviewing,
not looking at any new people.

06:48.269 --> 06:51.341
You're not interested in seeing
any applications.

06:51.509 --> 06:53.977
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.

06:54.149 --> 06:55.707
They don't know the activities.

06:55.869 --> 06:59.100
If I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
"Hey, look, I'm sure you're very nice.

06:59.269 --> 07:02.466
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now."

07:02.629 --> 07:03.744
When you're a kid...

07:03.909 --> 07:07.060
...you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid...

07:07.229 --> 07:10.301
...what are the qualifications? " If
someone's in front of my house...

07:10.469 --> 07:12.858
...that's my friend.
They're my friend. That's it.

07:13.029 --> 07:15.668
Are you a grownup?
No? Great. Come on in!

07:15.829 --> 07:19.185
Let's jump up and down on my bed!"
And if you have anything in common:

07:19.349 --> 07:22.785
"You like cherry soda? I like
cherry soda! We'll be best friends!"

07:28.389 --> 07:31.381
You only have two more weeks
before your benefits run out.

07:31.869 --> 07:34.463
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps,
to get...

07:34.629 --> 07:36.984
...a 13-week extension,
if that's possible.

07:37.349 --> 07:39.385
So where have you been looking
for work?

07:39.549 --> 07:41.301
You know what I've discovered,
Mrs. Sokol?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.546
It's not so much the looking...

07:43.709 --> 07:44.858
...as the listening.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.862
I listen for work.
As I'm looking...

07:48.029 --> 07:50.862
...and listening... I'm also looking.
You cannot discount looking.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.940
It's a combination.
It's looking. And listening.

07:53.109 --> 07:56.340
Listening. And looking.
But you must look.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.704
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

07:58.909 --> 08:00.979
Specific. Let's see...

08:01.149 --> 08:03.060
I've walked in and out
of so many buildings.

08:03.229 --> 08:04.628
They all blend in together.

08:04.789 --> 08:06.302
Just give me one name.

08:06.789 --> 08:08.302
One name. Absolutely.

08:09.229 --> 08:10.821
Let's see, there's...

08:10.989 --> 08:12.183
Vandalay Industries.

08:12.349 --> 08:14.738
I just saw them. I got very close there.
Very close.

08:14.909 --> 08:16.820
What type of company is that?

08:17.349 --> 08:19.260
Latex. Latex manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

08:19.989 --> 08:23.379
- And you interviewed there?
- Yes, for a sales position.

08:23.549 --> 08:24.902
Latex salesman.

08:25.069 --> 08:28.823
The selling of latex
and latex-related products.

08:29.989 --> 08:31.980
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!

08:32.149 --> 08:35.380
Now I'm going to need an address
and a phone number for this...

08:35.549 --> 08:36.698
...Vandalay company.

08:37.188 --> 08:38.621
You like gum?

08:38.789 --> 08:41.940
Because I have a friend in the gum
business. I got a gum guy!

08:42.109 --> 08:45.067
I make one phone call, have boxes
of gum delivered right to your door.

08:45.229 --> 08:46.821
The address?

08:48.189 --> 08:49.861
The address is...

08:52.629 --> 08:54.620
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

08:55.629 --> 08:58.507
- No.
- Jose Jimenez.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.944
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.747
The address.

09:06.269 --> 09:08.066
Vandalay is...

09:08.229 --> 09:11.778
...129 West 81 st Street.
It's a very small industry, Vandalay.

09:11.949 --> 09:13.701
It's why I wanted
to work for them.

09:13.869 --> 09:15.700
A phone number.

09:15.869 --> 09:18.463
That's... KL5...

09:19.029 --> 09:21.065
...8383. Are you planning on
calling them soon?

09:21.229 --> 09:23.379
Because they have
very strange hours.

09:23.549 --> 09:24.777
As soon as I'm done with you.

09:25.789 --> 09:27.507
Sure. Well...

09:27.669 --> 09:29.819
You know, I'll check in with you
next week.

09:29.989 --> 09:33.504
I gotta run now because
I got a full plate this afternoon.

09:33.669 --> 09:37.457
- Okay.
- All right. Really good to...

09:43.389 --> 09:44.378
He'll call you back!

09:44.549 --> 09:45.868
It's a par five.

09:46.029 --> 09:47.667
So, you know, I step up to the tee...

09:47.829 --> 09:51.139
...and I hit a beautiful drive
right down the middle of the fairway.

09:51.309 --> 09:53.664
- I mean, you know my hook, right?
- Elaine?

09:54.069 --> 09:55.582
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

10:01.149 --> 10:03.504
Jerry, he's a guy.

10:05.469 --> 10:07.937
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook.

10:08.109 --> 10:10.339
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.

10:11.429 --> 10:13.021
- Jerry! Jerry!
- George?

10:13.189 --> 10:15.578
- Kramer, put Jerry on!
- I'm in the middle of something.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.979
- Call back.
- Kramer, no...!

10:18.189 --> 10:20.657
So the ball takes off,
and I'm waiting for it to turn.

10:27.949 --> 10:29.177
Would you...!

10:31.669 --> 10:34.137
All right. Well, I'll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.

10:35.349 --> 10:36.828
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.

10:36.989 --> 10:38.866
She's wondering when
we'll go see the baby.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.987
- See the baby. Again with the baby.
- Who are they?

10:42.189 --> 10:45.261
A guy who used to live in the building
keeps calling us to see the baby.

10:45.429 --> 10:48.546
"You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?"

10:48.709 --> 10:50.188
Can't they just send us a tape?

10:50.349 --> 10:52.909
Maybe if you wait a few months,
it won't be a baby anymore.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.742
- Then you won't have to see it.
- Because he'll be all grown-up.

10:55.909 --> 10:57.183
Yeah...

10:58.549 --> 11:00.824
Hey, Kramer, what do you think
of this shirt?

11:06.349 --> 11:07.543
It's too busy.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.939
You're trying too hard
to make an impression on him.

11:10.109 --> 11:12.304
- You're not being yourself.
- What guy?

11:12.469 --> 11:15.859
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

11:16.549 --> 11:18.426
Who are you talking about?

11:19.269 --> 11:21.021
Keith... Hernandez.

11:21.189 --> 11:23.066
Keith Hernandez?

11:23.709 --> 11:25.825
Keith Hernandez!

11:27.269 --> 11:29.499
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?

11:29.669 --> 11:31.705
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.

11:31.869 --> 11:34.542
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I'm begging you.

11:34.709 --> 11:35.903
Please. Please!

11:40.989 --> 11:42.308
You know what?

11:42.909 --> 11:44.058
Bad mistake. My mistake.

11:44.229 --> 11:46.424
Go back. Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

11:46.589 --> 11:49.467
This lane stinks. Go back to your lane.
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

11:49.829 --> 11:53.299
Go! Go! Go! Make this light!
Make this light! Oh, man!

11:53.669 --> 11:55.307
That's it! Get out!

11:55.469 --> 11:57.505
- What do you mean, get out?
- Get out of the cab!

11:57.669 --> 11:59.341
What? I'm not getting out of this cab.

11:59.509 --> 12:02.387
No! No! You cannot throw me out!

12:02.549 --> 12:04.779
No! Get...

12:04.949 --> 12:06.621
Hello, Newman.

12:06.789 --> 12:08.017
I hate Keith Hernandez.

12:08.189 --> 12:10.908
- Hate him!
- I despise him.

12:11.069 --> 12:13.105
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you why.

12:13.269 --> 12:14.668
- Let me tell her.
- No, you can't...

12:14.829 --> 12:16.501
- You always tell.
- All right, tell it.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.625
- Just tell it.
- All right.

12:19.789 --> 12:23.179
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

12:23.349 --> 12:26.466
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

12:26.629 --> 12:28.824
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

12:28.989 --> 12:31.947
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

12:32.109 --> 12:34.907
Our day was ruined.

12:35.229 --> 12:38.141
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

12:38.309 --> 12:39.742
Now we're coming down the ramp.

12:39.909 --> 12:41.627
Newman was in front of me.

12:41.789 --> 12:43.745
Hernandez was coming toward us.

12:43.909 --> 12:48.858
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, "Nice game, pretty boy."

12:51.309 --> 12:53.539
Hernandez continued past us
up the ramp.

12:53.709 --> 12:56.701
Then, a second later,
something happened...

12:56.869 --> 13:00.578
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

13:00.749 --> 13:02.467
...from that day forward.

13:02.709 --> 13:04.700
- What was it?
- He spit on us!

13:07.069 --> 13:09.424
And I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

13:10.869 --> 13:15.226
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

13:18.069 --> 13:19.661
What a story.

13:19.829 --> 13:22.468
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

13:22.629 --> 13:24.859
...the whole premise of your account.

13:25.029 --> 13:27.589
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

13:27.749 --> 13:30.217
...as I've heard this story
a number of times.

13:30.389 --> 13:33.222
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

13:33.869 --> 13:35.700
According to your story...

13:35.869 --> 13:38.747
...Hernandez passes you
and starts walking up the ramp.

13:38.909 --> 13:41.139
Then you say you were struck...

13:41.869 --> 13:43.541
...on the right temple.

13:44.389 --> 13:46.983
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

13:47.149 --> 13:51.062
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the fourth rib.

13:53.669 --> 13:55.341
The spit then came off the rib...

13:55.509 --> 13:58.706
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

14:00.229 --> 14:02.538
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

14:04.509 --> 14:07.546
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

14:07.709 --> 14:09.665
...in midair, mind you...

14:10.949 --> 14:15.579
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

14:17.469 --> 14:20.506
That is one magic loogie.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.266
Well, that's the way it happened.

14:30.989 --> 14:33.219
What happened to your head
when you got hit?

14:33.389 --> 14:35.107
Well, my head...

14:35.269 --> 14:37.021
...went back, to the left.

14:37.189 --> 14:39.703
- Say that again.
- Back and to the left.

14:40.429 --> 14:42.420
Back and to the left.

14:43.429 --> 14:46.262
Back and to the left.

14:46.869 --> 14:48.188
So, what are you saying?

14:48.349 --> 14:49.987
I'm saying...

14:50.149 --> 14:53.619
...that the spit could not have
come from behind.

14:54.669 --> 14:56.978
That there had to have been
a second spitter.

15:04.749 --> 15:06.865
Behind the bushes,
on the gravelly road.

15:07.589 --> 15:09.819
If the spitter was behind you,
as you claim...

15:09.989 --> 15:13.459
...that would've caused your head
to pitch forward.

15:14.469 --> 15:18.257
So the spit could've only come
from the front and to the right.

15:18.429 --> 15:21.341
But that's not what they
would have you believe.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.022
I'm leaving.

15:24.509 --> 15:25.658
Jerry's a nut.

15:26.789 --> 15:28.188
Wait, wait, wait.

15:28.709 --> 15:31.746
The sad thing is,
we may never know the real truth.

15:38.789 --> 15:40.984
Did anybody call
asking for Vandalay Industries?

15:41.149 --> 15:43.902
- No, what happened to you?
- All right, listen closely:

15:44.069 --> 15:46.299
I was at the unemployment office.

15:46.469 --> 15:49.666
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandalay Industries...

15:49.829 --> 15:52.548
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

15:52.709 --> 15:55.098
...you have to answer,
"Vandalay Industries."

15:55.269 --> 15:57.464
- I'm Vandalay Industries?
- Right.

15:57.629 --> 15:59.745
- What is that?
- You're in latex.

15:59.909 --> 16:01.467
- Latex?
- Right.

16:01.629 --> 16:04.302
- What do I do with latex?
- I don't know! You manufacture it!

16:04.549 --> 16:08.383
- Right here in this little apartment?
- And what do I say about you?

16:08.549 --> 16:10.858
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

16:11.349 --> 16:13.863
- I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
- Right.

16:14.029 --> 16:16.543
I don't think so.

16:18.109 --> 16:19.781
Why would I do that?

16:19.949 --> 16:22.383
Because I asked you to.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.699
If you think I'm looking for someone
to just sit...

16:24.869 --> 16:27.747
...pushing papers around,
you can forget it.

16:27.909 --> 16:30.742
I've got enough headaches
just trying to manufacture the stuff.

16:33.629 --> 16:35.267
- Yeah?
- It's Keith.

16:35.429 --> 16:36.748
All right, we're coming down.

16:36.909 --> 16:38.183
Keith Hernandez?

16:38.349 --> 16:40.738
- Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go.
- Where are you going?

16:40.909 --> 16:42.467
They're giving me a ride downtown.

16:42.629 --> 16:45.348
You know, there had to have been
a second spitter. Who was it?

16:45.509 --> 16:46.658
Who had the motive?

16:46.829 --> 16:49.901
That's what I've been trying
to figure out the past five years.

16:50.069 --> 16:51.980
What the hell are you two
talking about?

16:53.669 --> 16:56.058
- That was really fun. Thanks.
- Yeah, it really was.

16:56.989 --> 16:58.661
Should I shak e his hand?

16:59.749 --> 17:01.148
Well...

17:01.309 --> 17:02.981
You want to catch a movie
this weekend?

17:03.149 --> 17:05.140
Have you seen JFK?

17:06.789 --> 17:08.381
No, I haven't.

17:09.189 --> 17:11.099
This week end. Wow!

17:11.868 --> 17:13.825
Sure. That would be great.

17:14.469 --> 17:17.983
Damn. I was too overanxious.
He must have noticed that.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.222
I mean, if you want to.

17:20.388 --> 17:23.222
- Well, how about this Friday?
- Yeah, Friday's okay.

17:24.189 --> 17:26.828
Go ahead, shak e his hand.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

17:26.989 --> 17:29.025
I've been on The Tonight Show.

17:30.229 --> 17:32.220
Well, good night.

17:32.389 --> 17:33.663
Good night.

17:33.989 --> 17:35.866
Oh, Jer, by the way...

17:36.029 --> 17:37.781
...the woman we gave
a ride to earlier...

17:37.989 --> 17:39.138
- Elaine.
- Yeah.

17:39.349 --> 17:41.943
- What's her story?
- I don't know. We used to go out.

17:42.549 --> 17:45.188
Would you mind if I gave her a call?

17:45.349 --> 17:47.704
- For a date?
- Yeah.

17:47.869 --> 17:49.461
Oh, no...

17:49.629 --> 17:51.221
Go ahead.

17:51.389 --> 17:52.868
You got a pen?

17:53.029 --> 17:54.382
You sure you don't mind?

17:56.000 --> 18:02.074

18:04.989 --> 18:06.308
So then we went to dinner.

18:06.469 --> 18:08.221
- Who paid?
- We split it.

18:08.389 --> 18:09.822
Split it. Pretty good.

18:10.109 --> 18:13.260
- Did you talk about game six?
- No. I gotta wait until it's the right time.

18:16.789 --> 18:18.063
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

18:18.229 --> 18:19.582
Come on up.

18:19.749 --> 18:21.148
So then what?

18:21.749 --> 18:23.262
Nothing. Then he took me home.

18:23.589 --> 18:25.341
Shake his hand?

18:26.629 --> 18:27.982
Yeah.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.980
What kind of a shake does he have?

18:30.469 --> 18:31.743
Good shake. Perfect shake.

18:31.909 --> 18:34.059
Single pump, not too hard.

18:34.229 --> 18:38.268
Didn't have to prove anything,
but firm enough to know he was there.

18:38.429 --> 18:40.181
So...

18:40.349 --> 18:42.305
...you're gonna see him again?

18:44.509 --> 18:46.784
He asked me if I was doing anything
Friday night.

18:47.749 --> 18:49.546
The weekend!

18:50.949 --> 18:53.258
So then, as I was getting out
of the car...

18:53.429 --> 18:54.782
- Hi!
- Oh, hi, Elaine.

18:54.949 --> 18:56.143
Hi, Elaine.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.140
So how was your date?

18:59.749 --> 19:01.899
What date? It's a guy.

19:02.069 --> 19:04.663
So you know... He called me.

19:04.909 --> 19:06.706
- Already?
- Keith called you?

19:08.989 --> 19:10.866
This guy really gets around.

19:13.989 --> 19:17.902
- Do you mind?
- No, I don't mind. Why should I mind?

19:18.389 --> 19:19.902
What did he say?

19:20.069 --> 19:21.900
He asked me out for Saturday night.

19:22.389 --> 19:23.663
- You going?
- No.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.979
- I told him I was busy.
- Oh, really?

19:26.149 --> 19:28.060
So we're going out Friday.

19:34.149 --> 19:36.219
- Friday?
- Yeah.

19:36.789 --> 19:38.302
He's going out with you on Friday?

19:39.029 --> 19:42.226
- Yeah?
- He's supposed to see me on Friday.

19:44.149 --> 19:46.538
- I didn't know.
- We made plans!

19:47.229 --> 19:49.789
- Well... I'll cancel it.
- No, don't cancel it.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.901
Well, this is a little
awkward, isn't it?

19:54.069 --> 19:55.900
Well, frankly, it is.

19:57.309 --> 19:59.584
I've never seen you jealous before.

19:59.749 --> 20:01.740
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.103
You didn't even watch it.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.021
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

20:05.189 --> 20:07.749
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

20:15.029 --> 20:17.418
Any Hennigan's around here?

20:23.509 --> 20:25.022
Vandalay Industries.

20:27.509 --> 20:29.818
Kell Varnsen speaking.

20:30.789 --> 20:32.381
May we help you?

20:32.949 --> 20:35.099
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.

20:36.429 --> 20:38.067
No, no, I don't mind at all.

20:38.229 --> 20:41.460
- No, no, no. I can cancel.
- Sure. We'll do something next week.

20:41.629 --> 20:43.381
No, it's no problem at all.

20:43.549 --> 20:45.938
Okay. Take it easy.

20:46.509 --> 20:49.069
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.227
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night?

20:51.389 --> 20:53.744
Friday night? Nothing. Now.

20:54.549 --> 20:55.868
Want to come to see the baby?

20:56.389 --> 21:00.064
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.143
If you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

21:03.309 --> 21:06.107
- All right, I'll go.
- All right. All right.

21:17.749 --> 21:19.023
I'll get it.

21:20.469 --> 21:22.027
Hello.

21:22.669 --> 21:24.068
What-delay Industries?

21:24.229 --> 21:25.548
- No!
- Vandalay!

21:25.709 --> 21:26.937
Say Vandalay!

21:27.109 --> 21:29.259
No, you're way, way, way off!

21:29.429 --> 21:31.989
Yeah, that's the right number,
but this is an apartment.

21:32.149 --> 21:34.299
- No, say...
- Vandalay! Say...

21:34.909 --> 21:36.388
Vandalay Industries!

21:37.229 --> 21:39.299
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

21:44.829 --> 21:47.184
How did you know who they wanted?!

21:54.669 --> 21:57.661
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

22:04.709 --> 22:05.983
Just sign here, please.

22:06.149 --> 22:08.902
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.

22:09.069 --> 22:11.708
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?

22:11.869 --> 22:15.259
- I could sell latex like that.
- Just sign that.

22:23.669 --> 22:26.263
- Who is this?
- It's my daughter.

22:27.349 --> 22:29.624
This is your daughter?

22:30.389 --> 22:32.220
My God!

22:32.389 --> 22:34.459
My God!

22:34.629 --> 22:37.985
I hope you don't mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.620
You think so?

22:42.789 --> 22:45.349
Would you take this picture away
from me? Just take it away.

22:45.509 --> 22:47.739
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.

22:47.909 --> 22:49.979
Let me just sign this and go.

22:50.149 --> 22:51.343
You know...

22:51.509 --> 22:53.579
...she doesn't even have a boyfriend.

22:54.469 --> 22:56.380
Okay. Okay.

22:56.829 --> 22:58.945
Who do you think you're talking to?

22:59.109 --> 23:01.418
You trying to make a joke,
Mrs. Sokol? It's not funny.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.783
I can tell you that.

23:03.269 --> 23:04.622
I'm serious. She doesn't.

23:05.309 --> 23:08.142
You know, it's one thing to not
give me the extension.

23:08.309 --> 23:11.381
But to tease and
to torture me like this...

23:11.549 --> 23:12.948
...there's no call for that.

23:13.669 --> 23:15.387
Would you like her phone number?

23:19.069 --> 23:22.220
Mrs. Sokol,
I don't know what to say.

23:22.389 --> 23:27.099
- Where should I sign this thing?
- No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it.

23:28.669 --> 23:30.148
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.

23:30.309 --> 23:33.267
Even if you get a job after
you've been unemployed...

23:33.429 --> 23:36.660
...they take unemployment out
of your check every week...

23:36.829 --> 23:39.662
...and show it to you in that little box.

23:40.509 --> 23:43.945
How good can it be for your
confidence that every paycheck...

23:44.109 --> 23:47.101
...has the word "unemployment"
on it?

23:47.789 --> 23:50.144
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!

23:50.309 --> 23:52.539
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

23:52.709 --> 23:54.540
I have a friend who's unemployed.

23:54.709 --> 23:56.427
He's collecting unemployment
insurance.

23:56.589 --> 24:02.107
This guy has never worked this hard
in his life to keep this thing going.

24:02.629 --> 24:07.419
He's down there every week waiting
on the lines and getting interviewed...

24:07.589 --> 24:10.467
...and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

24:10.629 --> 24:15.908
If they had any idea the effort
and energy that he is expending...

24:16.069 --> 24:19.186
...to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give
him a raise. I'm sure of it.

24:19.549 --> 24:22.143
The guy is doing a tremendous job...

24:22.309 --> 24:23.662
...not working.

24:26.229 --> 24:28.504
So tell me more
about this game six.

24:28.669 --> 24:31.467
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the tenth.

24:31.629 --> 24:34.268
We're one out away
from losing the series.

24:41.709 --> 24:43.779
Hello. How are you?

24:45.429 --> 24:47.863
So, what do you think?

24:48.549 --> 24:50.141
Do you love her?

24:50.309 --> 24:52.664
Yes, I do love her.

24:53.269 --> 24:56.067
You have a very nice place here.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.140
So who do you think she looks like?

24:58.309 --> 24:59.742
Lyndon Johnson.

25:00.749 --> 25:03.183
What? Lyndon Johnson?

25:03.349 --> 25:04.498
He's joking.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.979
No, I'm not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.

25:08.149 --> 25:11.459
Jerry, I can't believe it took you
so long to see the baby.

25:11.629 --> 25:14.860
I kept saying to Michael, "When is
Jerry going to see the baby?"

25:15.109 --> 25:16.542
I was saying the same thing.

25:17.189 --> 25:19.066
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.

25:19.269 --> 25:22.500
- You don't have to take a picture.
- I don't know where it is.

25:22.669 --> 25:25.467
It's in the bottom drawer
of our dresser.

25:25.629 --> 25:27.221
Hurry up!

25:28.389 --> 25:30.061
He's such an idiot.

25:31.829 --> 25:34.218
Jerry, you want to pick her up?

25:34.389 --> 25:36.141
- I better not.
- I'll pick her up.

25:36.309 --> 25:37.788
No!

25:39.109 --> 25:41.828
Thank you for a wonderful time,
George.

25:41.989 --> 25:43.183
Glad you enjoyed it.

25:43.349 --> 25:46.466
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.381
Billions and billions.

25:49.709 --> 25:51.506
Would you like to come up?

25:52.669 --> 25:54.466
Would I like to come up?

25:54.629 --> 25:57.302
I would love to come up.

25:57.469 --> 25:58.982
I'm... l'm fighting not to.

25:59.149 --> 26:00.707
Fighting.

26:01.549 --> 26:03.426
Unfortunately, I...

26:03.589 --> 26:07.901
...have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.

26:08.069 --> 26:10.629
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

26:11.749 --> 26:14.627
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

26:14.789 --> 26:17.223
I'm not saying I want to do it
for the rest of my life...

26:17.389 --> 26:19.266
...but hardware fascinates me.

26:19.429 --> 26:21.738
Wouldn't you love to make a key?

26:24.589 --> 26:26.659
Will you call me as soon
as you get home?

26:28.749 --> 26:30.865
- Tonight?
- Yes.

26:31.029 --> 26:35.420
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?

26:36.989 --> 26:39.901
You kill me. You really kill me.

26:41.589 --> 26:43.102
Well, good night.

26:48.629 --> 26:51.427
It was an accident. Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.

26:51.589 --> 26:53.978
Oh, she's gonna be all right.

26:55.029 --> 26:57.497
Here, baby. Here.
Here, baby.

26:57.669 --> 27:00.388
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?

27:00.869 --> 27:02.382
I have a friend who's got a baby.

27:03.429 --> 27:05.260
"Gotta see the baby.

27:05.509 --> 27:09.343
You've got to come over
and see the baby."

27:11.269 --> 27:14.545
Nobody ever wants you to come over
and see their grandfather, do they?

27:14.709 --> 27:17.587
"You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.

27:17.749 --> 27:19.580
He's so cute.

27:19.749 --> 27:25.187
168 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.

27:25.349 --> 27:26.702
He's 1000 months.

27:26.869 --> 27:30.544
You know, the mid-80s is such
a good time for the grand-people.

27:30.709 --> 27:32.381
The mid-80s, you gotta see them.

27:32.549 --> 27:35.188
He went to the bathroom
by himself today."

27:37.109 --> 27:40.101
You know what's tough about seeing
people when they have a baby...

27:40.269 --> 27:43.386
...is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

27:43.549 --> 27:45.619
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.302
"What do you think of him?"

27:47.469 --> 27:49.346
I'd like to meet a couple that goes:

27:49.509 --> 27:52.706
"You know, we're not that happy
with him, frankly.

27:52.869 --> 27:56.145
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.

27:56.309 --> 27:58.948
You want him? We don't even
want him. You want him?"

28:01.589 --> 28:04.547
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.

28:04.709 --> 28:06.188
Yeah, it was.

28:06.949 --> 28:09.941
Gosh, should I kiss her good night?

28:10.669 --> 28:12.978
Is he going to try and kiss me?

28:13.709 --> 28:16.507
- I love Cajun cooking.
- Really?

28:16.669 --> 28:18.466
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

28:18.629 --> 28:21.427
Oh, my father's half-drunk.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.460
Maybe they should get together.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.668
Go ahead. Kiss her.

28:28.829 --> 28:31.104
I'm a baseball player, damn it.

28:32.229 --> 28:33.787
What's he waiting for?

28:33.949 --> 28:35.826
I thought he was a cool guy.

28:37.349 --> 28:41.103
Come on. I won the MVP in '79.
I can do whatever I want to.

28:44.029 --> 28:46.304
Well, this is getting awkward.

28:47.509 --> 28:49.977
Well, good night.

28:50.149 --> 28:51.377
Good night.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.178
Who does this guy think he is?

28:59.349 --> 29:01.340
I'm Keith Hernandez.

29:04.189 --> 29:05.338
Who else?

29:06.029 --> 29:07.906
Mookie. Mookie was there.

29:08.069 --> 29:09.661
You know him?

29:10.469 --> 29:13.108
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.

29:14.069 --> 29:16.264
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.

29:16.429 --> 29:19.819
- He's the one who got that hit...
- I know. He got the hit in game six!

29:21.749 --> 29:23.068
So then what happened?

29:23.989 --> 29:25.263
Nothing. Then he took me home.

29:27.309 --> 29:29.459
So did you two...

29:31.909 --> 29:33.103
...have...?

29:34.629 --> 29:36.301
What?

29:37.669 --> 29:39.341
You know.

29:39.989 --> 29:41.104
Milk?

29:43.909 --> 29:46.867
- No.
- Cookies?

29:48.469 --> 29:50.061
Did he kiss you good night?

29:50.629 --> 29:51.982
I don't know.

29:53.149 --> 29:54.901
What do you mean, you don't know?

29:55.429 --> 29:58.501
All right. He kissed me, okay?

29:58.669 --> 30:00.148
Well, what kind of a kiss?

30:00.309 --> 30:04.302
Was it a peck? Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?

30:05.189 --> 30:07.180
Between a peck and a make-out.

30:08.549 --> 30:10.426
So you like him.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.025
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.

30:13.189 --> 30:14.542
Now you're jealous of him?

30:14.709 --> 30:17.348
I'm jealous of everybody.

30:22.629 --> 30:23.948
Hello.

30:24.109 --> 30:26.065
Oh, hi. What's happening?

30:27.189 --> 30:28.417
What?

30:31.589 --> 30:32.783
Sure.

30:34.469 --> 30:35.663
Yeah, okay.

30:35.829 --> 30:38.468
Then... I'll see you then.

30:38.629 --> 30:39.857
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

30:40.029 --> 30:41.178
Bye.

30:41.949 --> 30:44.144
- Who was that?
- That was Keith.

30:45.189 --> 30:48.306
- What's going on?
- He wants me to help him move.

30:49.309 --> 30:51.618
Help him move?

30:51.789 --> 30:53.108
Move what?

30:53.269 --> 30:55.783
You know, furniture.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.027
So, what did you say?

30:59.189 --> 31:01.544
I said, yes, but I don't feel right
about it.

31:01.709 --> 31:03.984
I mean, I hardly know the guy.

31:04.149 --> 31:06.868
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

31:07.029 --> 31:09.827
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.

31:12.509 --> 31:15.023
And you feel you're not
really ready for...

31:15.189 --> 31:16.861
Well, we went out one time.

31:17.029 --> 31:19.748
Don't you think that's coming on
a little too strong?

31:20.829 --> 31:22.467
Hey.

31:24.389 --> 31:25.902
What's going on?

31:26.549 --> 31:28.744
Keith Hernandez just asked me
to help him move.

31:29.189 --> 31:30.463
What?

31:31.349 --> 31:33.067
Well, you hardly know the guy.

31:36.349 --> 31:37.987
What a nerve!

31:38.149 --> 31:41.027
You see? Wasn't I right
about this guy? Didn't I tell you?

31:41.469 --> 31:43.346
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?

31:44.469 --> 31:47.541
- I said, yes.
- You said yes?!

31:47.989 --> 31:50.708
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

31:50.869 --> 31:54.066
I mean, how can you prostitute
yourself like this?

31:54.229 --> 31:56.299
Are you gonna start driving him
to the airport?

31:56.709 --> 31:58.540
I'm not driving him to the airport.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.427
Oh, boy. I don't know.

32:00.949 --> 32:03.258
- Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
- What?

32:03.429 --> 32:04.782
Don't mention it to anybody.

32:04.949 --> 32:07.258
I wish you never mentioned it to me.

32:18.229 --> 32:20.538
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.

32:20.709 --> 32:22.779
And I will call you
as soon as I get home.

32:22.949 --> 32:24.541
Don't bother.

32:25.549 --> 32:26.743
Bother? What kind of bother?

32:26.909 --> 32:29.264
I would prefer it if you didn't.

32:29.789 --> 32:32.940
- Why? Is anything wrong?
- It's over, buddy. Done.

32:33.109 --> 32:37.739
Finished. So long. Goodbye.
Adios. Sayonara.

32:38.789 --> 32:40.666
- Why?
- I've been thinking about it.

32:40.829 --> 32:42.865
You got no job.
You got no prospects.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.020
You're like Biff Loman.

32:47.109 --> 32:48.986
I went to the hardware store
interview.

32:49.149 --> 32:51.424
You think I'm going to spend my life
with somebody...

32:51.589 --> 32:54.581
...because he can get me a deal
on a box of nails?

32:55.549 --> 32:57.107
I thought we were a team.

32:57.749 --> 33:00.217
If I ever need a drill bit, I'll call you.

33:00.389 --> 33:02.061
Carrie, could you do me a favor?

33:02.229 --> 33:04.538
Could you not mention this
to your mother?

33:07.149 --> 33:09.344
You know, I hate to brag...

33:10.229 --> 33:13.027
...but I did win 11 straight
Gold Gloves.

33:13.189 --> 33:15.657
I wouldn't have brought it up,
but since you mentioned it.

33:16.149 --> 33:17.821
I didn't mention it.

33:18.589 --> 33:20.466
Well, I won them anyway.

33:20.989 --> 33:23.105
Well, so what? I mean...

33:23.269 --> 33:25.339
...you played first base.

33:25.509 --> 33:27.864
I mean, they always put
the worst player at first base.

33:28.029 --> 33:30.748
That's where they put me,
and I stunk.

33:31.709 --> 33:35.782
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

33:36.509 --> 33:39.899
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

33:40.069 --> 33:42.583
...and I know you'll never be there.

33:42.949 --> 33:44.860
The way I figure it,
I've already been there.

33:45.029 --> 33:48.021
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

33:49.709 --> 33:53.304
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

33:53.469 --> 33:56.381
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

34:00.109 --> 34:02.100
You know, I hate to say this...

34:02.269 --> 34:04.908
...but I really think that
we're hitting it off.

34:05.069 --> 34:07.902
- Get it? Get it?
- Clever.

34:10.789 --> 34:13.098
- What are you doing?
- What's that?

34:13.668 --> 34:15.659
- You smoke?
- Yeah.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.540
I didn't know you smoked.

34:19.829 --> 34:21.308
Is that a problem?

34:26.629 --> 34:28.665
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.

34:28.829 --> 34:30.626
- How do you know?
- Who wouldn't like him?

34:30.789 --> 34:32.141
I like him, and I'm a guy.

34:32.829 --> 34:35.184
I suppose he's an attractive man.

34:35.349 --> 34:38.306
Forget that. He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1979.

34:38.469 --> 34:42.098
I'm making wisecracks in some
nightclub. This guy was in game six.

34:42.509 --> 34:44.306
They're a perfect match.
They go together.

34:44.469 --> 34:47.108
Like one of these brother and sister
couples that look alike.

34:47.268 --> 34:50.625
I hate those couples. I could never be
one of those couples.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.507
There are no bald women around,
you know.

34:56.029 --> 34:59.066
I know this sounds a little arrogant,
but I never thought she'd find...

34:59.229 --> 35:01.697
...someone she liked better
than me. But, you know...

35:01.869 --> 35:04.144
...I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.

35:04.309 --> 35:05.981
You know what I'd like to do?

35:06.469 --> 35:09.222
I'd really like to have sex
with a tall woman.

35:09.389 --> 35:13.177
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5".

35:14.029 --> 35:15.223
Really?

35:15.389 --> 35:17.539
What was the tallest woman
you ever slept with?

35:17.709 --> 35:19.222
I don't know, 6'3".

35:19.389 --> 35:22.028
Wow! God!

35:22.949 --> 35:25.509
See, this is all I think about:
sleeping with a giant.

35:26.789 --> 35:28.541
It's my life's ambition.

35:28.709 --> 35:32.224
So I guess it's fair to say you've set
different goals for yourself than...

35:32.389 --> 35:35.108
...say, Thomas Edison, Magellan,
these type of people.

35:35.269 --> 35:37.339
Magellan? You like Magellan?

35:37.509 --> 35:40.865
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

35:41.229 --> 35:43.743
- Who do you like?
- I like de Soto.

35:44.429 --> 35:46.738
- De Soto? What did he do?
- Discovered the Mississippi.

35:46.949 --> 35:49.338
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

35:51.909 --> 35:54.218
All right. I gotta go down
to the unemployment office.

35:54.389 --> 35:56.857
- You want to take a walk?
- No, I got some stuff to do.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.907
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment
at 3. I'm helping him move.

36:00.269 --> 36:01.668
What?

36:02.549 --> 36:05.427
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!

36:05.589 --> 36:08.740
- I know. Isn't that something?
- Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

36:08.909 --> 36:12.538
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.

36:13.309 --> 36:15.345
Soon he'll have you driving him
to the airport.

36:15.509 --> 36:17.977
I'm not driving him to the airport!

36:22.509 --> 36:24.864
I gave. I gave everything I could,
Mrs. Sokol.

36:25.029 --> 36:27.748
- Nothing was good enough for her.
- Sign here, please.

36:27.909 --> 36:30.548
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.

36:30.709 --> 36:33.985
I'll tell you, she's very particular,
your daughter. Very particular.

36:34.149 --> 36:36.219
Is she looking for some
big hotshot businessman?

36:36.389 --> 36:38.823
Well, I've got my pride too.
I'm not gonna beg her.

36:38.989 --> 36:41.662
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

36:48.429 --> 36:49.623
You like baseball?

36:51.189 --> 36:52.861
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

36:53.029 --> 36:54.940
I saw every inning that year.

36:55.909 --> 36:59.982
It's funny, because I happen to be
very good friends with...

37:00.149 --> 37:02.105
...Keith Hernandez.

37:02.269 --> 37:04.829
You know Keith Hernandez.

37:04.989 --> 37:06.342
Know him?

37:07.149 --> 37:09.105
Would you... like to meet him?

37:09.549 --> 37:11.665
Oh, come on. Come on.

37:12.189 --> 37:15.022
I can produce Keith Hernandez,
right here...

37:15.669 --> 37:16.943
...within the hour.

37:17.189 --> 37:18.622
All right.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.026
You got one hour.

37:22.429 --> 37:24.499
All right, Mrs. S.

37:25.269 --> 37:29.103
I and my good pal
Keith Hernandez...

37:29.509 --> 37:31.147
...will be right back.

37:44.749 --> 37:47.388
129 West 81 st Street, and hurry.

37:50.189 --> 37:51.588
Or not.

37:56.989 --> 37:59.378
You better bring your gloves.
It's freezing out there.

37:59.549 --> 38:03.428
It shouldn't take too long.
I'd say maybe, oh, four hours.

38:05.069 --> 38:08.141
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.

38:08.309 --> 38:10.300
We got two dressers and the bed.

38:10.949 --> 38:13.747
- Is there a box spring?
- What's that?

38:13.909 --> 38:15.900
- A box spring?
- Yeah, there's a box spring.

38:16.069 --> 38:19.425
But it's attached to the headboard,
and we'll have to take that apart.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.068
Then we got the couch.

38:21.229 --> 38:24.301
- Is that a sectional?
- Yeah, 12 pieces.

38:24.469 --> 38:28.064
- A marble coffee table.
- Is that a thick marble?

38:28.709 --> 38:30.779
Three inches thick.
Got it in Italy.

38:30.949 --> 38:34.498
But the big problem is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

38:34.669 --> 38:36.341
When you move it,
it tends to open up...

38:36.509 --> 38:38.943
...so it's going to be difficult
getting it downstairs.

38:39.749 --> 38:41.421
Stairs?

38:42.069 --> 38:45.982
- There's no elevator?
- No, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

38:50.349 --> 38:52.340
- I'm sorry, I can't do this.
- What?

38:52.509 --> 38:55.069
I can't do it! I can't!
It's too soon.

38:55.229 --> 38:57.220
I don't know you.

38:57.909 --> 39:01.618
I can't help you move, I'm sorry.
I can't! I just can't.

39:10.469 --> 39:12.699
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.947
Oh, you don't remember me.

39:18.149 --> 39:20.060
- No. Should I?
- Yeah, yeah, you should...

39:20.229 --> 39:22.140
...because I certainly remember you.

39:23.349 --> 39:25.101
Let me refresh your memory.

39:25.509 --> 39:29.422
June 14th, 1987.

39:29.589 --> 39:32.706
Mets-Phillies. You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

39:32.869 --> 39:35.019
Then you're coming up
the parking lot ramp.

39:35.189 --> 39:37.578
You said, "Nice game, pretty boy."

39:38.349 --> 39:41.580
- You remember.
- And then you spit on us.

39:41.749 --> 39:43.546
- Hey, I didn't spit at you.
- Yeah, right.

39:43.709 --> 39:46.462
- No, no. Then who was it?
- Look, the way I remember it...

39:46.629 --> 39:49.541
...I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.

39:49.709 --> 39:51.586
That's when you called me
"pretty boy."

39:51.749 --> 39:54.468
Hey, that tick ed me off.
I was turning to say something...

39:54.949 --> 39:56.541
...and as I turned around...

39:56.829 --> 39:59.821
...I saw Roger McDowell
behind the bushes...

40:00.029 --> 40:02.145
...over by that gravelly road.

40:06.469 --> 40:09.586
Anyway, he was talking to someone,
and they were pointing at you.

40:09.749 --> 40:11.705
I tried to scream out,
but it was too late.

40:11.869 --> 40:13.348
It was already on its way.

40:13.589 --> 40:14.704
I told you.

40:16.869 --> 40:21.147
- It was McDowell.
- But why? Why McDowell?

40:22.389 --> 40:24.857
Maybe because we were sitting
in the right-field stands...

40:25.029 --> 40:27.304
...cursing at him in the bullpen
all game.

40:27.909 --> 40:30.787
He must have caught a glimpse of us
when I poured that beer on his head.

40:32.629 --> 40:35.268
- It was McDowell.
- Oh, boy.

40:36.229 --> 40:39.585
- Look, Keith, we're sorry.
- Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.

40:39.749 --> 40:41.785
Guys, don't worry about it.

40:41.949 --> 40:44.861
- Well, I guess I better get going.
- What are you doing?

40:45.029 --> 40:47.418
- I gotta move.
- You want any help?

40:48.229 --> 40:50.299
- I'd love some. You sure?
- I'd love to help you.

40:50.469 --> 40:51.697
Yeah, me too!

40:51.869 --> 40:53.780
Okay, guys. We got to be careful
of one thing.

40:53.949 --> 40:57.146
Some of the stuff is very fragile
We'll have to handle it like a baby.

40:57.309 --> 40:59.027
Hey, no sweat.

41:11.189 --> 41:12.383
Hello.

41:12.549 --> 41:15.109
Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on?

41:15.269 --> 41:16.861
No, he just left.

41:17.029 --> 41:18.508
You broke up with him?

41:18.669 --> 41:20.227
Me too!

41:22.029 --> 41:23.701
What happened?

41:23.869 --> 41:27.987
Oh, smoking. You know, you're like
going out with C. Everett Koop.

41:28.829 --> 41:31.104
Me? No.
I couldn't go through with it.

41:31.269 --> 41:33.305
I just didn't feel ready.

41:33.469 --> 41:35.346
So, what are you doing now?

41:35.789 --> 41:37.108
Oh, great idea. Okay.

41:37.269 --> 41:38.987
I'll meet you there in, like,
30 minutes.

41:39.149 --> 41:40.741
Okay, bye.

41:41.509 --> 41:43.579
Keith! Keith!

41:43.749 --> 41:47.105
- What happened? Where's Keith?
- You just missed him. He just left.

41:48.149 --> 41:49.980
What do you need him for?

41:50.549 --> 41:53.700
Keith! Keith! Up here!

41:53.869 --> 41:55.427
Look, could you do me a favor?

41:55.589 --> 41:57.819
I need you to go to the
unemployment office with me!

41:58.509 --> 41:59.908
l... I'm Jerry's friend!

42:00.069 --> 42:01.900
The guy from the locker room!

42:02.069 --> 42:03.627
I'm the chucker!

42:03.789 --> 42:05.780
lt'll take five minutes!

42:05.949 --> 42:08.861
Wait! Wait!

42:21.509 --> 42:22.862
Well, Biff...

42:25.349 --> 42:26.702
...what's next?

42:27.869 --> 42:29.018
I don't know.

42:31.189 --> 42:32.861
Excuse me.

42:33.029 --> 42:34.621
I was walking behind you, and you...

42:35.269 --> 42:36.941
...dropped your wallet.

42:40.389 --> 42:43.461
When you're moving,
your whole world becomes boxes.

42:43.629 --> 42:46.701
That's all you think about,
is boxes. Where are there boxes?

42:46.869 --> 42:49.747
You just wander down the street,
going in and out of stores.

42:49.909 --> 42:52.901
"Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?"

42:53.069 --> 42:56.345
I mean, you can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

42:56.509 --> 42:59.501
"Shut up! I'm looking for boxes!"

43:00.109 --> 43:03.146
So after a while, you become
really into it. You can smell them.

43:03.309 --> 43:04.822
You walk into a store:

43:04.989 --> 43:06.980
"There's boxes here.

43:07.149 --> 43:10.937
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it! I can smell them!"

43:12.029 --> 43:13.178
You become, like, obsessed.

43:13.349 --> 43:16.386
"I love the smell of cardboard
in the morning."

43:16.549 --> 43:19.666
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:

43:19.829 --> 43:21.501
"That's a nice box.

43:22.229 --> 43:25.301
Does anybody know where
that guy got that box?

43:25.469 --> 43:27.619
When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

43:27.789 --> 43:29.825
It's got some nice handles on it."

43:30.149 --> 43:34.222
And that's what death is, really.
It's the last big move of your life.

43:34.389 --> 43:35.822
The hearse is like the van.

43:35.989 --> 43:37.502
The pallbearers are close friends.

43:37.669 --> 43:40.866
The only ones you could really ask
to help you with a big move like that.

43:41.029 --> 43:43.065
And the casket is that great,
perfect box...

43:43.229 --> 43:45.026
...you've been looking for
your whole life.

43:45.229 --> 43:47.902
The only problem is
once you find it, you're in it.
