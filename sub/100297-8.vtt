00:03.762 --> 00:06.547
<i>MIKE (ON COMPUTER): Mandy, what do
you want me to do? I'm stuck here.</i>

00:06.549 --> 00:08.824
<i>I need you to help your mom
get ready for Bonnie's wedding.</i>

00:08.826 --> 00:10.543
But she's being unreasonable
and I don't know

00:10.545 --> 00:11.994
how to deal with that.

00:11.996 --> 00:14.871
Usually I'm on the other side.

00:14.873 --> 00:17.443
This blizzard has the
whole mountain shut down.

00:17.445 --> 00:19.227
I'll get to the wedding tomorrow,

00:19.229 --> 00:21.062
even if I have to
tunnel through the snow.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.565
But in the meantime, you're up.

00:23.567 --> 00:27.027
Can't Kristin do it?
She's known Mom longer.

00:27.029 --> 00:28.184
Listen, she's pregnant,

00:28.186 --> 00:29.876
she doesn't need the stress, kid.

00:29.878 --> 00:31.698
Well, what about Jen? Or the mailman?

00:31.700 --> 00:33.366
He's reliable.

00:33.368 --> 00:36.536
<i>Uh-uh. We're family, and
you're gonna do this.</i>

00:36.538 --> 00:37.871
Fine.

00:37.873 --> 00:40.724
- She's here, I have to go.
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:40.726 --> 00:43.787
... there was a kind of...
Oh, Vanessa, darling,

00:43.789 --> 00:47.574
look at your wonderful daughter,
folding wedding programs.

00:47.576 --> 00:49.034
- What a dear.
- Yeah,

00:49.036 --> 00:51.128
well, waiting until the
day before the wedding

00:51.130 --> 00:53.714
is cutting it a little
close, but yes, a dear.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.916
Have you heard from your father?

00:56.918 --> 00:59.919
I have, but I don't
think I want to tell you.

00:59.921 --> 01:02.255
He's snowed in at the cabin, isn't he?

01:02.257 --> 01:06.235
Oh, I hope he started a
fire. Nothing is cozier.

01:06.237 --> 01:10.314
Yeah, well, being where you're
supposed to be is cozier.

01:10.316 --> 01:11.949
- You spit a little.
- What... Oh.

01:14.167 --> 01:16.082
Uh, so how did it go at the caterer?

01:16.084 --> 01:18.155
Oh, everything seemed lovely.

01:18.157 --> 01:21.733
Your-your mother had an issue
with the bread baskets, which...

01:21.735 --> 01:23.313
W... No-no, no, I j-I just thought

01:23.315 --> 01:24.618
there wasn't enough variety,

01:24.620 --> 01:27.405
so I had them add a
pretzel roll and a focaccia.

01:27.407 --> 01:30.241
And I just, you know,
took a swing. (CHUCKLES)

01:30.243 --> 01:32.786
Darling, you have got to relax.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.930
This wedding is going
to be just perfect.

01:34.932 --> 01:36.457
Nothing like my first wedding,

01:36.459 --> 01:38.934
- which was pee-ew...
- Okay.

01:38.936 --> 01:42.420
Mom, Mom... you know,
that-that's like the tenth slam

01:42.422 --> 01:44.318
you've taken against your first wedding.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.208
We get it. It wasn't great.

01:46.210 --> 01:48.025
Well, it's just that
everything was so rushed.

01:48.027 --> 01:50.086
- The whole thing was...
- And now 11.

01:51.264 --> 01:55.284
Okay. Well, I am off to bed, ladies.

01:55.286 --> 01:59.196
I'm going to be dreaming
of the perfect wedding.

01:59.198 --> 02:02.440
I see focaccia plum fairies

02:02.442 --> 02:04.460
dancing in my head.

02:06.154 --> 02:09.447
Yes, she'll get the perfect wedding.

02:09.449 --> 02:10.523
You'll see.

02:10.525 --> 02:12.784
You'll all see.

02:12.786 --> 02:15.712
If you tell a crazy
person they're crazy,

02:15.714 --> 02:17.139
does it make it better or worse?

02:17.141 --> 02:18.998
Mandy, I am not crazy.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.977
I just... I just need
everything to be perfect, okay?

02:21.979 --> 02:23.795
Why? It's Grandma's second wedding,

02:23.797 --> 02:26.005
and Ed's, like, 12th.

02:26.007 --> 02:28.650
All right, you know
what? I'm gonna tell you.

02:28.652 --> 02:30.686
I'm gonna tell... I don't
want to keep things from you,

02:30.688 --> 02:32.654
the way my mom did with me.

02:32.656 --> 02:36.566
The reason this is so
important to me is because...

02:36.568 --> 02:39.736
I ruined my mother's first wedding.

02:39.738 --> 02:41.521
How? You-you weren't even born.

02:41.523 --> 02:43.148
No, but I was there. I was there.

02:43.150 --> 02:44.366
She hated her first wedding

02:44.368 --> 02:47.411
because she was pregnant, with me.

02:47.413 --> 02:50.488
- (GASPS) I can't believe this.
- Yeah.

02:50.490 --> 02:52.549
Grandma's cool? (CHUCKLES)

Oh. My. God. I know something about you

03:03.295 --> 03:04.996
nobody else in this entire family knows.

03:04.998 --> 03:06.037
I can't wait to tell them.

03:06.039 --> 03:08.524
- N... Mandy. Mandy.
- No-no-no, don't worry.

03:08.526 --> 03:11.718
I'll wait until after
you're dead. I can't wait.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.564
Okay, you know what? Telling
you was a terrible mistake.

03:14.566 --> 03:17.107
No, no, no, Mom, Mom, Mom,
Mom, I am an amazing confidant,

03:17.109 --> 03:20.018
okay? I... I know exactly
when to look concerned.

03:20.020 --> 03:22.687
I-I know how to... to
gently touch your arm,

03:22.689 --> 03:25.582
and I have got the
cutest sympathetic nod.

03:27.711 --> 03:30.045
Mandy, please, please, honey,

03:30.047 --> 03:32.180
this was not an easy
thing for me to admit.

03:33.074 --> 03:34.791
(SIGHS)

03:34.793 --> 03:38.036
I understand. How long have you known?

03:38.038 --> 03:39.112
All right, just a few weeks.

03:39.114 --> 03:41.256
I saw Grandma's wedding certificate,

03:41.258 --> 03:43.917
and was definitely pregnant
with me when she got married.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.561
Well, what did Grandma
say when you told her?

03:45.563 --> 03:49.214
No. I didn't tell her. No, wow. No.

03:49.216 --> 03:52.258
I-I feel like this explains
so much about my childhood.

03:52.260 --> 03:55.784
Look, if I can just give her
the wedding she'd always wanted,

03:55.786 --> 03:57.722
always deserved, then, I don't know,

03:57.724 --> 03:59.933
maybe it'll clean the slate between us.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.743
What? Hold on, what
do... what do you mean,

04:01.745 --> 04:04.821
clean the slate? Mom, you
didn't ruin Grandma's wedding.

04:04.823 --> 04:06.439
You were just a little thing.

04:06.441 --> 04:09.126
A little... pootie-pootie doodle head.

04:10.496 --> 04:13.088
- I want a baby so bad.
- I know.

04:13.090 --> 04:16.007
Look, it doesn't make
sense in my head, either,

04:16.010 --> 04:17.422
but it makes sense in my heart.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.500
Oh... Oh, and that was real sympathy,

04:19.503 --> 04:21.122
I swear to God, it just came out.

04:21.124 --> 04:24.741
Look, honey, I really need
your help with this wedding.

04:24.743 --> 04:26.268
Mom, every time I was in trouble,

04:26.270 --> 04:28.127
you were there for me, so
I'm gonna be there for you.

04:28.129 --> 04:29.369
What-what can I do?

04:29.371 --> 04:30.971
All right, well, I'm
putting you in charge of Ed.

04:30.973 --> 04:31.999
He cannot ruin this.

04:32.001 --> 04:33.435
Oh, he's not gonna ruin it.

04:33.437 --> 04:35.110
- He loves Grandma.
- Mm.

04:35.112 --> 04:36.416
It's so sweet, sometimes

04:36.418 --> 04:38.263
- it crosses over into icky.
- Yeah.

04:38.265 --> 04:41.617
Well, Ed has a history
of messing up weddings.

04:41.619 --> 04:43.026
He was late for his first

04:43.028 --> 04:44.848
and showed up drunk at his second,

04:44.850 --> 04:47.456
and came to his third in cargo shorts.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.459
Cargo shorts at a wedding.
This will not stand.

04:53.631 --> 04:55.154
Where have you guys been?

04:55.156 --> 04:57.040
I already finished making
all of the gift bags.

04:57.042 --> 04:59.617
Ryan made us swing by the church.

04:59.619 --> 05:02.120
We're going to be ushers. I
just wanted to check the layout.

05:02.122 --> 05:03.472
It's a bunch of benches.

05:03.474 --> 05:07.333
How can you not know
what a church looks like?

05:07.335 --> 05:09.482
Well, I didn't know
if it was a proscenium

05:09.484 --> 05:10.704
or a church in the round.

05:10.706 --> 05:13.056
I mean, the last time I ushered
was at my high school play.

05:13.058 --> 05:14.900
Which I should have been in.

05:16.636 --> 05:19.345
But we won't get into that right now.

05:19.347 --> 05:22.640
Oh, I understand. I'm not upset.

05:22.642 --> 05:24.401
No, I don't get upset.

05:24.403 --> 05:25.786
Okay, I love you, too.

05:27.164 --> 05:28.413
Jackass.

05:30.501 --> 05:31.971
Talking to Mike?

05:31.973 --> 05:33.471
No, Eve.

05:33.473 --> 05:35.153
She can't make it to
the wedding, either.

05:35.155 --> 05:37.488
Her commander thinks
tactical air training

05:37.490 --> 05:38.924
is more important than love.

05:40.118 --> 05:42.702
- Jackass.
- Yeah.

05:42.704 --> 05:44.754
I guess you'll have to return

05:44.756 --> 05:47.040
this beautiful dress.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.592
Unless you know someone

05:48.594 --> 05:50.894
her exact same size.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.097
That's a great idea, Jen.

05:54.099 --> 05:55.543
Would you like to fill in for Eve?

05:55.545 --> 05:58.360
More than anything in the world!

05:58.362 --> 06:00.612
Oh, great. Well, my
workload just doubled.

06:01.699 --> 06:04.040
I mean, I guess I'll just be,

06:04.042 --> 06:06.172
uh, ushering people to their seats

06:06.174 --> 06:08.227
while everyone else is up on stage.

06:08.229 --> 06:10.330
It's <i> Bye Bye Birdie</i> all over again.

06:16.455 --> 06:18.905
Oh, I'll-I'll call you back.
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

06:18.907 --> 06:22.703
- Hi, Ed.
- Mandy. Mandy, don't you look beautiful.

06:22.705 --> 06:26.037
All right, so, uh, so to
what do I owe the pleasure?

06:26.039 --> 06:29.248
Oh, well, uh, I hear that it's tradition

06:29.250 --> 06:31.722
for the groom to see his future...

06:31.724 --> 06:35.707
step... grand... daughter.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.900
Mm, uh. All right, I never heard that.

06:38.902 --> 06:40.885
Anyway, since I'm here,

06:40.887 --> 06:42.812
uh, I might as well give
you a ride to the church.

06:42.814 --> 06:44.555
So-so we can get you there on time.

06:44.557 --> 06:46.983
Oh, that's not necessary.

06:46.985 --> 06:49.486
Oh. Look at the tux.

06:49.488 --> 06:50.820
Oh...

06:50.822 --> 06:52.438
Lovely jacket,

06:52.440 --> 06:55.417
shirt, tie, pants.

06:55.419 --> 06:57.568
- Good for you.
- Mm-hmm.

06:57.570 --> 07:00.497
All right.

07:00.499 --> 07:01.965
What you... what you working on?

07:05.453 --> 07:07.620
I know what you're doing.

07:07.622 --> 07:09.005
You're checking up on me, right?

07:09.007 --> 07:10.915
Me? No.

07:10.917 --> 07:13.251
All right, Mandy. Cut the cute, now.

07:13.253 --> 07:14.729
Now, if Mike put you up to this,

07:14.731 --> 07:17.255
tell him I do not need a babysitter.

07:17.257 --> 07:19.054
Now, come on, I've got to
get dressed. Let's go.

07:19.056 --> 07:20.684
- Okeydoke.
- Come on, come on.

07:20.686 --> 07:23.070
Those were long pants, right?

07:24.305 --> 07:26.472
Um... all right.

07:26.474 --> 07:28.784
I wish people would stop
using my lint roller.

07:28.786 --> 07:32.529
Every time I go to use
it, the sticky's all gone.

07:32.531 --> 07:34.081
You know who you are.

07:38.128 --> 07:41.320
You know you can just
peel off that top layer.

07:41.322 --> 07:42.631
Maybe you can.

07:42.633 --> 07:43.757
Moneybags.

07:45.043 --> 07:47.649
Uh, what are you doing here?

07:47.651 --> 07:50.193
I'm on a secret mission. Follow me.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.811
You know what? Watch
what you say in here.

07:55.813 --> 07:58.221
I've always suspected
your dad bugged this place.

07:58.223 --> 08:00.223
You know why?

08:00.225 --> 08:03.276
'Cause he's a good man who works hard.

08:05.282 --> 08:08.019
Okay, listen. This wedding
is very important to my mom,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.325
- so she asked me to keep an eye on Ed.
- Why?

08:10.327 --> 08:12.556
Well, apparently, Ed has this history

08:12.558 --> 08:13.943
with ruining his past weddings,

08:13.945 --> 08:17.356
so it's my job to get him there
on time, sober, and in a tux.

08:17.358 --> 08:18.858
No-no, I meant, why did she ask you?

08:18.860 --> 08:19.909
I'm head of security.

08:19.911 --> 08:22.153
I got cameras all over Outdoor Man.

08:22.155 --> 08:23.946
If I can keep an eye on a whole store

08:23.948 --> 08:26.133
I can certainly keep
track of one old man.

08:28.253 --> 08:30.345
Hey, babe. Uh, can I get a
ride to the church with you?

08:30.347 --> 08:32.255
Why? I thought you were going with Ed.

08:32.256 --> 08:33.849
Me too. But he just left.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.958
What do you mean? Where did he go?

08:36.961 --> 08:40.230
I don't know, but he sure did
seem like he was in a hurry.

08:41.525 --> 08:42.941
I'll check the monitor.

08:47.698 --> 08:49.531
Chuck, get eyes for Ed.

08:49.533 --> 08:52.016
Uh, I think you mean "eyes on Ed".

08:52.018 --> 08:54.087
Whatever. Where are his eyes?

08:54.089 --> 08:57.038
Right now they're driving
out of the parking lot.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.565
Oh, no. Well, maybe he's
on his way to the church.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.576
Yeah, not if he's planning
on wearing his tux.

09:03.046 --> 09:06.047
Dad? If you're listening,
this is not my fault.

09:13.373 --> 09:14.747
<i>How did you lose him?</i>

09:14.749 --> 09:17.083
Well, there-there's a
lot of blame to go around,

09:17.085 --> 09:19.302
- but most fingers are pointing to Chuck.
- Hey!

09:19.304 --> 09:22.743
<i>You need to stop arguing
and start looking for him.</i>

09:22.745 --> 09:24.601
<i>He's either at home, the VFW,</i>

09:24.603 --> 09:27.260
<i>or any bar in the greater
Denver area, all right?</i>

09:27.262 --> 09:29.095
I wish you were here.

09:29.097 --> 09:30.211
<i>Listen, I'm working on it.</i>

09:30.213 --> 09:31.926
<i>I drove a snowmobile
to the airport in Vail.</i>

09:31.928 --> 09:33.747
<i>I'll be on the next flight
out of here, all right?</i>

09:33.749 --> 09:36.227
<i>Look, Ed couldn't</i> have
gone far. As long as we find him

09:36.229 --> 09:38.532
and get him to the wedding,
none of this ever happened.

09:38.534 --> 09:40.064
It's gonna be okay.

09:40.066 --> 09:42.158
(SIGHS) Thanks, Dad. You
always know what to say.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.994
Uh, Vanessa just pulled in.

09:44.996 --> 09:47.297
Run for your lives. Baxter out.

09:50.618 --> 09:53.503
<i>♪ Here comes the bridesmaids ♪</i>

09:53.505 --> 09:56.139
<i>♪ All dressed like bridesmaids ♪</i>

09:57.342 --> 10:01.460
Kristin. What the heck.

10:01.462 --> 10:04.255
I told you I'm not wearing that dress.

10:04.257 --> 10:07.466
I'm pregnant. The dress isn't.

10:07.468 --> 10:11.429
But it's tradition.

10:11.431 --> 10:13.306
Bridesmaids have to dress the same,

10:13.308 --> 10:15.617
so they can be a backdrop for the bride.

10:15.619 --> 10:19.028
The bride has to shine.

10:19.030 --> 10:22.815
She will shine. I
just won't be as itchy.

10:22.817 --> 10:25.151
(CHUCKLES) You can still wear the dress.

10:25.153 --> 10:28.112
No. This is not how it's supposed to go.

10:28.114 --> 10:30.030
What if all the bridesmaids
in the movie <i> Bridesmaids</i>

10:30.032 --> 10:31.282
didn't dress like bridesmaids?

10:31.284 --> 10:34.511
Then it would just be called
<i>Some Friends Who Show Up.</i>

10:35.600 --> 10:38.047
Oh, Jen, darling,

10:38.049 --> 10:40.333
you look lovely.

10:40.335 --> 10:42.793
Thank you. See?

10:42.795 --> 10:44.814
She wants us to wear the dresses.

10:44.816 --> 10:47.131
She'll be so mad if we don't.

10:47.133 --> 10:48.725
Oh, honestly, no, no, no.

10:48.727 --> 10:50.727
Y-You girls wear whatever you like.

10:50.729 --> 10:53.804
My first wedding, we didn't
even have bridesmaids.

10:53.806 --> 10:55.207
(CHUCKLES) See?

10:55.209 --> 10:57.141
Oh, technically, I guess we did.

10:57.143 --> 11:01.663
My mother threw dresses on
two complete strangers. Ugh.

11:02.815 --> 11:04.741
That's what you are to me.

11:04.743 --> 11:06.710
A complete stranger.

11:11.658 --> 11:15.034
Bet's to you, moneybags.

11:15.036 --> 11:17.012
Hey, Mom. 'Sup?

11:17.014 --> 11:19.635
Uh, I forgot to give Ed his boutonniere.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.357
- Where is he?
- Oh, it's okay. I will give it to him.

11:22.359 --> 11:23.434
Bye-bye.

11:24.504 --> 11:27.171
What, uh, w-what are you guys playing?

11:27.173 --> 11:30.214
- Well, uh...
- Oh, God, I can't take the pressure, okay?

11:30.216 --> 11:32.510
He's gone. Mr. Alzate is gone.

11:32.512 --> 11:33.770
What? Ed's gone?

11:33.772 --> 11:35.271
I'm sorry I cracked, Mandy.

11:35.273 --> 11:37.198
- You saw how she went after me.
- Wh...

11:37.200 --> 11:39.609
Where-where is Ed?

11:39.611 --> 11:41.785
We don't know. W-We... He's
not answering his phone.

11:41.787 --> 11:43.204
But don't worry, we'll find him.

11:43.206 --> 11:44.706
Oh, God, oh, God, I did it again.

11:44.708 --> 11:46.875
Oh, I've let my mother down.

11:46.877 --> 11:48.859
So much for a clean slate.

11:48.861 --> 11:52.029
The slate will just
stay dirty. I'll just...

11:52.031 --> 11:54.716
I'll always be dirty,
filthy-slate Vanessa.

11:54.718 --> 11:57.034
(COMPUTER RINGING)

11:57.036 --> 11:59.537
Hey, it's-it's Mike calling back.

11:59.539 --> 12:01.163
For the first time.

12:01.165 --> 12:03.582
Mike! Mike.

12:03.584 --> 12:06.085
Hey, have you heard? Ed's missing.

12:06.087 --> 12:07.920
What?

12:07.922 --> 12:10.256
Drop it, Dad. Give us what you got.

12:10.258 --> 12:12.602
<i>W-Wait. I got an idea.
Uh, Chuck, do you remember</i>

12:12.604 --> 12:14.235
<i>when we put that tracking
app on Ed's phone?</i>

12:14.237 --> 12:15.800
Oh, yeah. When he kept losing it.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.541
T-This is no time to reminisce.

12:17.543 --> 12:20.408
- We have got to find Ed.
- On it, Baxter.

12:20.410 --> 12:22.722
A-All right. They're closing
the door, so I got to go.

12:22.724 --> 12:24.487
<i>Everything's gonna be okay, Vanessa.</i>

12:24.489 --> 12:27.582
Yeah, I'm turning it off.

12:27.584 --> 12:31.086
Are you gonna be like this
for the whole half hour?

12:31.088 --> 12:33.404
H-Hey, h-hey, I-I found Ed.

12:33.406 --> 12:35.239
What... Oh, thank God.

12:35.241 --> 12:37.834
If he's in a bar, I'll kill him.

12:37.836 --> 12:40.595
He's in the hospital.

12:40.597 --> 12:42.597
What did you do?

12:50.423 --> 12:52.904
Ed? What happened?

12:52.906 --> 12:54.133
Are you okay?

12:54.135 --> 12:55.926
I'm fine.

12:55.928 --> 12:59.096
Oh, okay. I mean, you
know, I-I'm only asking

12:59.098 --> 13:01.524
because you're in a hospital
bed on your wedding day.

13:01.526 --> 13:02.859
(CHUCKLES)

13:02.861 --> 13:05.644
It's kidney stones.

13:05.646 --> 13:07.789
- Kidney stones? (SIGHS)
- Yeah.

13:07.791 --> 13:09.791
Why does everything always happen to me?

13:10.735 --> 13:12.259
Oh, y... To-to you.

13:12.261 --> 13:14.537
No, I mean, to-to you.

13:14.539 --> 13:17.242
I can usually ride them out,
but this one's different.

13:17.244 --> 13:19.283
I mean, it's been getting
worse all week. I...

13:19.285 --> 13:21.970
Damn thing feels like
the size of a meatball.

13:22.997 --> 13:24.639
Ah, well, that's one thing

13:24.641 --> 13:26.361
I'm gonna delete from the family menu.

13:27.988 --> 13:30.207
Ed, why-why didn't you tell anybody?

13:30.209 --> 13:32.981
- (MOANS) Don't.
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

13:32.983 --> 13:35.518
Yeah, I thought I could
get over here, see the doc

13:35.520 --> 13:38.561
and get some pain meds and still
make it to the wedding, and...

13:38.563 --> 13:40.488
but when he saw the size of it...

13:40.490 --> 13:41.990
- Well, here I am.
- Mm.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.566
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:43.568 --> 13:45.346
Yeah, I wish you had
said something sooner.

13:45.348 --> 13:46.811
We could have postponed the ceremony.

13:46.813 --> 13:49.164
Oh, no, no, Vanessa. I th...
did not want that to happen.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.148
This was too important to you.

13:51.150 --> 13:52.661
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Mm, well, I mean,

13:52.663 --> 13:55.336
not that it matters
now, but yeah, it-it was.

13:55.338 --> 13:58.364
I was just... I was just
trying to make up for something

13:58.366 --> 13:59.841
at her first wedding.

13:59.843 --> 14:01.584
Her first wedding?

14:01.586 --> 14:03.661
That's not something you need to do.

14:03.663 --> 14:04.921
No, trust me, it-it is.

14:04.923 --> 14:06.664
E-Ed, I don't want to talk about it.

14:06.666 --> 14:08.308
I just... I can't.

14:09.544 --> 14:12.062
Holy crap. You know.

14:13.339 --> 14:15.148
Know what?

14:16.359 --> 14:18.935
Holy crap,<i> you</i> know!

14:18.937 --> 14:21.900
- (EXCLAIMS)
- Oh, sorr... sorry. I'm sorry.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.220
Please. Oh, God...

14:23.222 --> 14:24.849
Of course I know. We're getting married.

14:24.851 --> 14:28.111
She told me all about her
past life and I told her...

14:28.113 --> 14:30.038
much of mine.

14:31.541 --> 14:35.284
Well, I mean, I'm glad
she confided in someone.

14:35.286 --> 14:37.903
When you love each other, you
don't have secrets between you.

14:37.905 --> 14:40.364
Yeah, well, you'd think, right?

14:40.366 --> 14:43.409
Yeah, but you're keeping a
secret now from her, right? Huh?

14:43.411 --> 14:45.911
Maybe it's time you two come clean.

14:45.913 --> 14:48.998
(SIGHS) I don't know, Ed.
I ju... It's too scary. I...

14:49.000 --> 14:50.762
Scary? You want scary?

14:50.764 --> 14:52.277
I'm about to become
your stepfather, so...

14:52.279 --> 14:53.469
(BOTH LAUGH)

14:53.471 --> 14:55.396
- Oh! Don't-don't...
- I'm sorry. Oh...

14:55.398 --> 14:57.107
- Don't come closer.
- So sorry.

14:58.885 --> 15:00.885
What?

15:00.887 --> 15:02.386
What happened?

15:02.388 --> 15:04.263
(SIGHS)

15:04.265 --> 15:05.890
You can tell me. I'm a Marine.

15:05.892 --> 15:07.450
I can handle bad news.

15:08.653 --> 15:10.394
I just... (SIGHS)

15:10.396 --> 15:13.606
I mean, I don't know what
I'm gonna tell my mom.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.941
(CRYING): Oh, God.

15:15.943 --> 15:18.212
I loved the guy so much.

15:18.214 --> 15:19.972
I don't know what I'm
gonna do without him.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.166
ED: Get the hell in here, Chuck.

15:23.168 --> 15:25.051
Damn.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.764
(GASPS) Oh.

15:29.766 --> 15:32.267
- How is he?
- Uh, he's fine.

15:32.269 --> 15:34.102
Did he-did he pass the stone yet?

15:34.104 --> 15:36.846
Uh, well, the-the doctor
said it could take a while.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.757
Oh. I suppose that's because

15:39.759 --> 15:41.300
it has to travel quite a...

15:41.302 --> 15:43.695
(CHUCKLES) ... distance.

15:48.476 --> 15:50.243
Oof.

15:52.989 --> 15:55.512
Mom, I-I... I-I need
to tell you something

15:55.514 --> 15:57.805
and, uh, it's-it's not easy.

15:58.795 --> 16:01.296
I saw your old marriage certificate.

16:01.298 --> 16:03.298
I did the math.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.967
Oh.

16:05.969 --> 16:07.719
Surprise.

16:09.306 --> 16:11.735
Mom, a-all those things
you've been saying

16:11.737 --> 16:12.831
about your first wedding,

16:12.833 --> 16:14.667
I mean, it's obvious you resented me.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.001
Even though

16:16.003 --> 16:18.314
I-I was just a little
pootie-pootie doodle head.

16:18.316 --> 16:21.275
Oh, darling, I... Oh, please.

16:21.277 --> 16:23.939
Oh, those barbs were not aimed at you.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.197
They were aimed at me.
I was... I was disappointed.

16:27.199 --> 16:29.014
In myself, in your father

16:29.016 --> 16:31.659
for getting us into
that situation, and...

16:31.661 --> 16:33.494
Although...

16:33.496 --> 16:36.664
we did have some fun
getting there, too. (LAUGHS)

16:36.666 --> 16:39.250
Oof.

16:40.820 --> 16:42.912
I suppose I-I should've...

16:42.914 --> 16:44.505
I should've told you the truth,

16:44.507 --> 16:46.249
but in-in my defense,

16:46.251 --> 16:48.569
I am a tightly-wound, repressed,

16:48.571 --> 16:51.254
Episcopalian control freak.

16:51.256 --> 16:54.873
I mean, apparently, not
that one night, but...

16:54.875 --> 16:58.414
Look, Mom, I'm just worried

16:58.416 --> 17:01.232
that I may have ruined more
than just your first wedding.

17:01.234 --> 17:04.174
I-I feel like I may
have ruined your life.

17:04.175 --> 17:07.103
Darling, what are you talking about?

17:07.105 --> 17:09.584
Well, I mean, you always
wanted a college education,

17:09.586 --> 17:12.942
and-and being pregnant with
me kind of stopped that.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.894
Sweetheart,

17:15.896 --> 17:19.690
I got exactly the
education that I wanted.

17:19.692 --> 17:23.920
I raised an exceptional daughter.

17:25.196 --> 17:26.696
Thank you, Mom.

17:26.699 --> 17:28.791
- (CRYING)
- Thank you.

17:28.793 --> 17:31.410
(CHUCKLES) Look what I found.

17:31.412 --> 17:33.949
A giant kidney stone attached
to a stubborn Spaniard.

17:33.951 --> 17:36.132
BONNIE: Oh. Edward, are
you all right, darling?

17:36.134 --> 17:38.134
- Oh, oh, no, no, no.
- I know, I know.

17:38.136 --> 17:40.085
All the better to see you, my dear.

17:40.087 --> 17:41.896
Wait, should-should he be up?

17:41.898 --> 17:44.056
No. But he's Ed.

17:45.476 --> 17:48.144
He said there was no way he
was gonna miss this wedding.

17:48.146 --> 17:50.980
Edward, you are not
to leave this hospital.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.634
No, no. I've waited
through four bad marriages

17:53.636 --> 17:54.984
to get to this one.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.953
I'm not gonna wait another day.

17:57.914 --> 17:59.914
You know what?

17:59.916 --> 18:01.749
Maybe you don't have to.

18:05.548 --> 18:07.554
(CHUCKLES) Don't start without us.

18:07.556 --> 18:09.832
- VANESSA: Oh, wow.
- Oh... Oh, my God!

18:09.834 --> 18:13.928
- Oh, you girls look beautiful.
- Yeah.

18:13.930 --> 18:16.121
Kristin, I didn't know
you were gonna wear it.

18:16.123 --> 18:18.266
I did.

18:18.268 --> 18:21.859
We're your bridesmaids.
We-we wanted you to shine.

18:21.861 --> 18:23.629
(CHUCKLES)

18:23.631 --> 18:25.106
She said it's coming off in a half hour,

18:25.108 --> 18:26.182
- so we should get going.
- VANESSA: Yeah, yeah. -Mm-hmm.

18:26.184 --> 18:27.591
Okay. Okay.

18:27.593 --> 18:29.968
We also brought you
something for your hair.

18:29.970 --> 18:32.896
Oh, how beautiful. Oh, darling.

18:32.898 --> 18:34.268
- Thank you. Isn't that lovely?
- Here, Mom, I'll do it.

18:34.270 --> 18:35.524
- Yes, beautiful. All right, where?
- Yeah, yeah. Stick it...

18:35.526 --> 18:36.934
- Right there? Okay, got it.
- I think the... Yeah.

18:36.936 --> 18:38.453
- Let me do it!
- Aah!

18:40.198 --> 18:42.373
There's a right way and a wrong way.

18:44.485 --> 18:47.486
Ooh, okay. (CHUCKLES)

18:47.488 --> 18:49.526
You girls really do look beautiful.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.490
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

18:51.492 --> 18:54.785
Excuse me, I'm looking for
the Alzate-Davis wedding.

18:54.787 --> 18:58.011
- Mike! Oh, my God.
- (LAUGHS) Oh, God.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.888
And minutes to spare. I
could've got myself a hot dog.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.116
Honey, honey, listen, I-I
know you had a long travel day,

19:03.118 --> 19:04.553
but I-I kind of need
you to get in there.

19:04.555 --> 19:06.222
- Yeah.
- Uh, gladly. You two look wonderful.

19:06.224 --> 19:07.673
Thanks, Dad. Mwah.

19:07.675 --> 19:08.816
- All right.
- And Mike?

19:08.818 --> 19:11.176
- Yeah?
- I'm so glad you're here.

19:11.178 --> 19:13.029
#MeToo.

19:15.516 --> 19:17.015
(CLAPPING)

19:17.017 --> 19:19.494
Okay, people. Here's
how it's going to go.

19:19.496 --> 19:22.738
Me first, because I'm shortest,
then Kristin, then Mandy.

19:22.740 --> 19:26.742
Lead with your right foot and...

19:26.744 --> 19:28.878
- (MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE)
- Okay...

19:59.518 --> 20:01.560
(MUSIC STOPS)

20:01.562 --> 20:04.396
Okay, we're gathered here
today because of the miracle

20:04.398 --> 20:06.190
of Yamaha snowmobiles

20:06.192 --> 20:09.735
and Rocky Mountain Regional Airlines.

20:09.737 --> 20:13.714
So, we stand here before God,

20:13.716 --> 20:15.199
family,

20:15.201 --> 20:17.534
friends

20:17.536 --> 20:21.222
and the afternoon staff here
at Denver General Hospital.

20:28.756 --> 20:30.974
Hey, Mike Baxter here for Outdoor Man

20:30.976 --> 20:34.092
- to tell you about a-a secret sale.
- Shh!

20:34.094 --> 20:37.723
Mm. "So, when is it?"
"What's for sale, Mike?"

20:37.725 --> 20:38.847
"How much is discounted?"

20:38.849 --> 20:41.443
Look, I'm not telling you, because...

20:41.445 --> 20:43.037
it's a secret.

20:43.039 --> 20:44.896
That's frustrating, isn't it?

20:44.898 --> 20:46.523
There are some things
you should keep secret,

20:46.525 --> 20:48.284
some things you shouldn't. (CHUCKLES)

20:48.286 --> 20:50.682
If you've ever owned a
pair of MC Hammer pants,

20:50.684 --> 20:52.582
you might want to take
that to your grave.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.583
Although they're quite comfortable.

20:54.585 --> 20:58.351
The saying goes, "Our secrets
make us sick, but be careful.

20:58.353 --> 20:59.783
Depending on what you're sharing,

20:59.785 --> 21:01.901
confessions can bite you in the ass".

21:01.903 --> 21:03.517
Now, if it's really
important to keep a secret,

21:03.519 --> 21:05.542
word of advice: don't
bug your own office.

21:05.544 --> 21:09.143
You were an odd bird, Tricky Dick. Man.

21:09.145 --> 21:11.118
Sometimes secrets weigh so heavily on us

21:11.120 --> 21:13.810
that it's hard to move forward
while carrying them around.

21:13.812 --> 21:15.335
Mm, it's like trying to paddle upriver

21:15.337 --> 21:17.410
with a canoe full of beer kegs.

21:17.412 --> 21:20.695
Trust me, it's easier coming
back upriver when they're empty.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.244
Make it so.

21:22.246 --> 21:23.819
So if something is weighing you down,

21:23.821 --> 21:25.331
maybe it's time to lighten your load.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.782
And if you need somewhere to put it,

21:27.784 --> 21:29.913
as chance would have
it, we've got 50% off

21:29.915 --> 21:31.237
hard-shell cargo carriers.

21:31.239 --> 21:33.405
Look at that... I just
told you my secret.

21:33.407 --> 21:37.242
I-I feel better. How
about you? Baxter out.
