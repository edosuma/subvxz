00:23.516 --> 00:25.984
- Watch him!
- I got him!

00:27.553 --> 00:28.986
Whoo!

00:29.055 --> 00:31.421
I got it!
I got it! Johnny!

00:39.732 --> 00:43.168
I got it! I got it!

00:43.236 --> 00:45.170
- No basket.
- What?

00:45.238 --> 00:48.503
You were out of bounds.
You stepped on the baseline.

00:48.574 --> 00:51.839
You stepped out of bounds.
I gave him a double dribble.

00:51.911 --> 00:53.469
Fine. No basket.

00:53.546 --> 00:55.377
You don't have to call
with a magnifying glass.

00:55.448 --> 00:58.975
What's a magnifying glass got to do with
it? The rule's enforced or it isn't.

00:59.051 --> 01:02.316
- Take the ball out, Larry.
- Here we go.

01:02.388 --> 01:04.355
I love that look
you give, Nathan.

01:04.423 --> 01:06.789
That big, toothy grin.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.292
- Larry, enough.
- What's that grin mean?

01:08.361 --> 01:10.329
He's white, so he's got to call it
ticky-tack to keep even?"

01:10.396 --> 01:13.160
- You said it. I didn't.
- You want Affirmative Action on the basketball court too.

01:13.232 --> 01:15.996
One set of rules for you
and one for everybody else.

01:16.068 --> 01:18.901
Larry, shut your mouth.
Take the ball out. Let's go.

01:18.971 --> 01:21.565
- What's everybody's problem today?
- Check.

01:21.641 --> 01:23.871
- Let's go.
- Your ball.

01:23.943 --> 01:26.571
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:26.646 --> 01:29.080
He ain't
got nothing.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.851
I got the jump.

01:32.919 --> 01:35.149
- Foul!
- Foul?

01:35.221 --> 01:37.746
- Oh, man!
- That was clean, Larry.

01:37.823 --> 01:39.586
Yeah, sure.

01:39.659 --> 01:41.354
Hey, Nathan.

01:41.427 --> 01:44.555
I made 130,000 bucks last year.
How much did you make deliverin' mail?

01:44.630 --> 01:47.690
I know a brother got made partner
in your firm instead of you,

01:47.767 --> 01:49.701
but that's no cause
for you to bust my balls.

01:49.769 --> 01:53.364
- You think that's what this is about?
- I don't know what this is about.

01:53.439 --> 01:55.373
Just shut our mouths
and go back to playing.

01:55.441 --> 01:57.375
Or what? Nathan will
gum up my mailbox?

01:57.443 --> 01:59.604
Get out of my face.
Don't do that, man.

01:59.679 --> 02:02.147
- Or what?
- Lay your hands on me again, and I'm gonna show you.

02:02.214 --> 02:04.944
- I ain't playing with you.
- That's all you're good for is playing.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.354
What are you doing?

02:09.422 --> 02:12.653
- You all right?
- I can't believe I did that.

02:12.725 --> 02:14.659
Larry!

02:18.464 --> 02:21.592
He's in full arrest. We need
an ambulance. My bag, there's a phone.

02:23.703 --> 02:26.001
- The red one?
- Yeah, the red one.

02:33.446 --> 02:35.971
This is Detective
John Kelly in 15 squad.

02:36.048 --> 02:39.176
I need Emergency Service and an EMS
for a possible cardiac...

02:39.251 --> 02:43.244
at the 63 Street YMCA,
second floor basketball court.

02:43.322 --> 02:45.984
Yes. Yes.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.794
What's going on?

04:03.629 --> 04:07.065
12, 13, 14, 15.

04:13.005 --> 04:14.939
Nothing.

04:16.509 --> 04:18.773
Is he dead, Jerry?

04:20.413 --> 04:22.347
He's dead,
isn't he?

04:25.485 --> 04:28.045
Yeah. He's dead.

04:29.355 --> 04:31.289
Oh, God.

04:35.194 --> 04:39.893
Kohnstam's a bachelor.
Does anyone know his folks?

04:41.768 --> 04:44.760
I do. 206.

04:44.837 --> 04:47.067
What's that?

04:48.341 --> 04:50.935
The area code.
They live in Seattle.

04:55.081 --> 04:57.845
What did he go off
on me for?

04:57.917 --> 05:01.080
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

05:01.154 --> 05:04.612
Come on. Come on.

05:04.690 --> 05:06.817
- Hejust startedjumping me.
- I know.

05:06.893 --> 05:10.056
- What was wrong with him?
- I know.

05:10.129 --> 05:13.963
I'm gonna... I'm gonna have
to take you downtown.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.796
For what?

05:15.868 --> 05:17.893
They're gonna
wanna talk to you.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.904
Talk to me about what?
You saw what happened.

05:19.972 --> 05:22.839
But you hit the guy. He went down.
They're gonna wanna talk about it.

05:22.909 --> 05:25.969
Screw you, John. I'm not going down
to that station. I'm going home.

05:26.045 --> 05:28.275
You're putting me
in a bad position here, Nathan.

05:28.347 --> 05:32.681
- What, am I under arrest?
- Put your voice down, will ya?

05:32.752 --> 05:36.017
Let's go in there
and we'll take care of it.

05:36.088 --> 05:38.215
No. You arrest me.

05:38.291 --> 05:41.454
You arrest me. You arrest me
in front of our friends.

05:43.296 --> 05:45.423
All right.
You're under arrest.

05:45.498 --> 05:47.557
You have the right
to remain silent.

05:47.633 --> 05:51.569
You have the right
to an attorney at any time.

05:51.637 --> 05:56.973
If you cannot afford one, a lawyer will
be supplied for you free of charge.

05:57.043 --> 05:58.977
Do you understand
what I just said?

06:01.380 --> 06:03.644
Do you understand me?

06:03.716 --> 06:07.743
Yeah. I understand.

06:25.671 --> 06:27.696
- Hi.
- Assistant District Attorney Craig called.

06:27.773 --> 06:29.968
- He said he'd be a few minutes late.
- Oh.

06:33.145 --> 06:35.079
Hey, hey, hey.
Look who's here.

06:35.147 --> 06:38.742
- Mr. Giardella. Alphonse.
- There you go.

06:38.818 --> 06:40.752
I was about
to fine you 25 cents...

06:40.820 --> 06:42.947
for failing
to use my first name.

06:43.022 --> 06:44.956
Fruit?

06:45.024 --> 06:48.357
Uh, no.
No, thank you.

06:48.427 --> 06:50.861
So the D.A.'s
gonna be late, huh?

06:50.930 --> 06:52.864
Did you talk
to him too?

06:52.932 --> 06:56.663
Yeah, I talk toJimmy a lot.
Why shouldn't I?

06:56.736 --> 06:59.603
I gotta make sure he makes a jump
on everybody in his office.

06:59.672 --> 07:01.537
You too, Laura.

07:01.607 --> 07:04.576
Believe me, I know enough to make sure
everybody looks good.

07:04.644 --> 07:08.944
I know Mr. Craig feels your
information's been very productive.

07:09.015 --> 07:11.540
I got another confession
I wanna make to you right now.

07:11.617 --> 07:15.451
Why don't we wait on confessions until
Mr. Craig gets here and we're on tape.

07:15.521 --> 07:18.115
This is personal.

07:18.190 --> 07:20.158
You've been showing up
in my dreams lately.

07:20.226 --> 07:23.787
Who do you belong to anyhow? You got
a husband or an old man or something?

07:23.863 --> 07:27.526
I don't think my social life is really
relevant to what's going on in this room.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.830
Believe me, what I've been
dreaming about,

07:29.902 --> 07:32.063
believe me, it's relevant.

07:32.138 --> 07:34.629
- Well...
- Good morning.

07:34.707 --> 07:36.641
Sorry I'm late.

07:36.709 --> 07:38.700
Me and Laura figured
you were early.

07:39.879 --> 07:42.074
Shall we get started?

07:42.148 --> 07:44.673
Give me a second
to powder my nose.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.684
To be continued.

07:50.556 --> 07:53.616
- Where were you?
- I got stuck in traffic.

07:53.693 --> 07:55.752
I didn't.

07:57.530 --> 08:01.091
- What does that mean?
- This is the third time this week you've been late.

08:01.167 --> 08:03.499
If you have something
on your mind, say it.

08:03.569 --> 08:07.471
I feel like I'm being dangled in front of
Alphonse Giardella like a piece of meat.

08:09.141 --> 08:13.526
Am I upset that this guy
has half a crush on you? No.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.629
But that does not mean
I am pimping you out to him.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.630
It does not mean
I am showing up late...

08:18.698 --> 08:20.893
as part of some strategy
to put your virtue at risk.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.496
And you're making another mistake
if you think I'm pleased...

08:25.572 --> 08:28.063
the two of us are standing here
arguing about this.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.369
You asked me.
I'm telling you how I feel.

08:32.445 --> 08:37.405
What? What? What? Am I sensing
a tension in the atmosphere here?

08:37.482 --> 08:41.783
We're fine.
Let's go to work.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.737
Here you go. Sit down.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.775
- What's this?
- You got a minute?

09:10.550 --> 09:13.519
I play basketball
with this guy twice a week.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.146
He's a buddy of mine.

09:16.222 --> 09:20.818
He and another guy got into a beef.
The other guy is kind of a jerk.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.293
Getting
in Nathan's face, pushing,

09:23.363 --> 09:25.388
and Nathan tried
to walk away,

09:25.465 --> 09:27.695
but the guy wouldn't
give him any room.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.702
Finally Nathan takes a slug at him
and the guy goes down, dead.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.301
- What's his story?
- He's a good citizen.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.342
He got in some trouble
when he was a kid, 18, 19...

09:36.409 --> 09:40.072
- What kind of trouble?
- It was a marijuana charge and failure to appear.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.171
He did six months.
But he's clean, Lieutenant.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.217
He's a mail carrier.
He's a good guy.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.014
A family man.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.782
So I read him his rights.
He's a little shook up.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.552
But I think somebody else
should be assigned.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.083
- Medavoy's up. I'll fill him in.
- I just need a minute with him.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.860
- I can't do this. I can't go to jail.
- I know.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.495
I'll do my best
to make it easy on you.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.301
But we gotta take a few steps here.
D.A.'s gotta look into this.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.934
- We got... What?
- This is Detective Medavoy.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.241
He's gonna handle the case
because I'm a witness.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.407
So you wanna make a statement,
you give it to him.

10:16.482 --> 10:19.042
I'm not gonna make any statement.
I'm not gonna do anything.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.712
- I have to write up a statement.
- Well, what about me, man?

10:21.788 --> 10:26.122
You're gonna be here for awhile
until the D.A. Decides what to do.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.218
I'll put you in an interview room
while we interview the witnesses.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.923
- You gonna lock me up?
- In an interview room.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.024
But he'll be able to change his clothes
in there, get coffee?

10:35.101 --> 10:36.534
Yeah.

10:36.602 --> 10:42.040
- You're gonna lock me up?
- I gotta, man. I gotta lock you up.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.611
Go ahead.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.613
- I'll talk to you later.
- Sure you will.

11:06.532 --> 11:10.366
John, we got a homicide
in F.D.R. At Pearl Street.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.370
You want me
to grab Martinez?

11:12.438 --> 11:14.463
Nah. Let mejust get
some clothes.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.998
Listen. Did you get
squared away on your buddy?

11:18.077 --> 11:20.944
Yeah.
I gave it to Medavoy.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.413
Look at this.
I'm ankle deep in water over here.

11:23.483 --> 11:28.546
It's full of hair. It's somebody's hair
keeps cloggin' up the drain.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.851
I guess that rules you out
as a suspect.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.954
Boy, that's really funny.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.963
Funny.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.334
Mr. Zimmer.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.345
I'm Detective Kelly.
This is Detective Sipowicz.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.041
- I know this is a hard time for you.
- She never hurt anyone.

11:56.115 --> 11:59.016
- Not as long as I knew her.
- You feel like answering any questions?

11:59.085 --> 12:01.280
We were just driving,
just talking.

12:01.354 --> 12:05.256
Then I heard a noise.
Must've been the gunshot.

12:05.324 --> 12:08.953
I turned around and Joan's
bleeding all over her face.

12:09.028 --> 12:11.223
Next second I lost control
and crashed the car.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.731
She say anything?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.860
No. Half
her head's gone.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.461
- You just heard the one shot?
- I think so.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.632
I don't know.
There might have been more.

12:21.707 --> 12:25.165
Did you notice any other
cars around you? Makes? Drivers?

12:25.244 --> 12:28.372
- No.
- Anybody driving erratically or anything?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.643
- No.
- Where were you headed?

12:30.716 --> 12:36.382
I was... headed to my mother-in-law's
to pick up the baby.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.481
God, what am
I gonna say to her?

12:40.259 --> 12:43.285
She have any dispute at work?
A promotion? Raise?

12:43.362 --> 12:46.456
- Something like that?
- She's on maternity leave.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.466
How about you?
Anybody mad at you?

12:48.534 --> 12:50.263
No.

12:50.336 --> 12:53.499
- What kind ofbusiness are you in?
- Electronic services.

12:53.573 --> 12:57.475
She's dead. She's dead.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.307
Let's go get your baby.
We'll get you a ride.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.347
Come on. Take your time.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.420
Crime Scene puts one bullet
in the right side of the woman's head.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.059
Pieces of a hollow point and one bullet
recovered from the seat back in front.

13:22.134 --> 13:25.831
Nine millimeter. Ballistics is
pretty sure it was a flat trajectory.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.839
The bullet's got to have come
from another car.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.967
- How does the husband check out?
- We're still pulling stuff in.

13:31.043 --> 13:34.171
The borough commander okayed a canvass of
the motorists off that exit ramp this morning.

13:34.247 --> 13:38.684
You'll have assistance from the highway
patrol cops, and you can use Martinez.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.912
The kid's making
into an okay cop.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.854
Yeah. Don't give him
any bad habits.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.893
I'm gonna meet you out there.
I'm gonna make Nathan's arraignment.

13:50.963 --> 13:54.660
- No problem.
- Kelly, it's postponed till this afternoon.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.759
The arraignment?
How come?

13:56.836 --> 14:00.033
Your friend punched out a prison guard
and then tried to run.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.041
They're filing
supplementary charges.

14:03.109 --> 14:06.272
- Is the guard hurt?
- They said some stitches next to the eye.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.307
- Thanks for keeping me posted.
- Sure.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.319
Judy.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.220
Why did they postpone
Nathan's arraignment?

14:17.290 --> 14:21.124
Well, evidently, there was some kind
of altercation with a guard.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.060
- Between Nathan and a guard?
- Yeah, evidently.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.121
I called you.
You didn't get my messages?

14:26.198 --> 14:28.792
I got them.

14:28.868 --> 14:33.066
The district attorney said that
they're gonna charge him with homicide.

14:33.139 --> 14:36.131
That's just the category they use
when they go before the grand jury.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.199
Once the medical report is in,
I can testify...

14:38.277 --> 14:40.370
Is that supposed
to reassure me?

14:40.446 --> 14:43.438
I can't be
at the late arraignment,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.848
but I will definitely
see Nathan later.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.852
If you get to talk
to him in court,

14:47.920 --> 14:51.788
please tell him to calm down
'cause it's only gonna make it worse.

14:51.857 --> 14:54.417
He left yesterday morning...

14:54.493 --> 14:56.552
to go play basketball.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.995
I know. I'm sorry.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.999
Judy...

15:09.008 --> 15:11.408
For God's sakes, let's get this moving.
I gotta make a living.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.411
Morning.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.947
Were you driving in this area
about the same time yesterday?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.949
- I'm from Phoenix.
- Okay.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.814
- Were you here yesterday?
- No. I was in Indianapolis.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.285
- Come on.
- What are you doing? Let's go!

15:22.355 --> 15:25.017
- Were you around here yesterday?
- Are you on your lunch break?

15:25.091 --> 15:27.025
- Let's go already!
- Thanks.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.994
- Move it!
- This guy with the horn's a pain in the ass.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.257
Come on!

15:32.331 --> 15:36.324
How about you just relax, pal?
Wejust wanna ask you a few questions.

15:36.402 --> 15:39.997
I heard. The answer's no, so go suck
on some doughnuts and get out of my way.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.802
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, you...

15:42.875 --> 15:45.207
- Andy, let's go.
- Come here!

15:45.277 --> 15:49.543
Let him go.
We'll radio ahead. Andy...

16:09.468 --> 16:12.130
- Hands on the wheel!
- What the hell are you chasing me for?

16:12.204 --> 16:14.866
Give me your license
and registration.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.874
- What do you want?
- Get over there.

16:16.942 --> 16:19.137
- All right.
- Your license and registration.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.873
- All right.
- Let's see your hands.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.381
Now, we're gonna talk
about that finger right there.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.783
The one in the middle that you were sticking
up in the air. What was that all about?

16:27.853 --> 16:30.117
You had traffic all screwed up.
I'm in a rush.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.657
Okay, so you were
trying to help, huh?

16:32.725 --> 16:35.717
You were pointing at something that you
thought would help clear up the traffic.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.319
- Correct?
- Something like that.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.921
Then say so.
I was trying to help."

16:39.999 --> 16:41.933
- I was trying to help.
- Okay.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.266
Now, I'm gonna ask you a few questions
about a shooting yesterday,

16:45.337 --> 16:49.774
and then maybe we'll go have some coffee
and suck on a doughnut.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.037
- I'm from Brooklyn. I never left there yesterday.
- You see?

16:52.111 --> 16:55.080
I didn't even ask you
that question yet, Harvey.

16:55.147 --> 16:57.081
Now we're gonna have
to start all over again.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.549
- You do wanna help, don't you, Harv?
- Sure.

16:59.618 --> 17:01.518
- Then say so. I want to help."
- I want to help.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.556
Good. Now, relax.

17:04.623 --> 17:07.955
This shouldn't take any more
than 10, 15 minutes.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.358
Half hour, tops.

17:15.434 --> 17:18.368
- Mr. Zimmer.
- What, you think I did it?

17:18.436 --> 17:21.736
- Hold on now. Take it easy.
- Am I a suspect or what?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.741
You've been calling
my friends, my relatives.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.175
You conduct an investigation
by eliminating things.

17:26.244 --> 17:28.645
We're looking into every possibility
and motive for how your wife got shot.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.774
- I think you'd want us to do that.
- Nobody's singling you out.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.513
We're checking cars off the highway
looking for witnesses,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.249
- checking past shootings in the area.
- Making any progress?

17:37.323 --> 17:39.553
- We'll let you know.
- I hope at least you've ruled me out.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.559
I hope you got that far.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.323
- We'll keep you posted.
- That's great.

17:44.396 --> 17:48.230
I see my wife murdered in front of me. I
got a three-month-old I got to take care of.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.895
I've got to go through getting
hounded and persecuted by you people.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.367
That's
a natural reaction, right?

17:59.445 --> 18:03.745
- So how come I make this guy a jerk?
- Kelly. Sipowicz.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.750
Give me a minute?

18:14.693 --> 18:16.786
Kelly and Sipowicz,
you know Licalsi and Lucas.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.295
How you doing?

18:18.364 --> 18:21.026
Lucas and Licalsi were working
Street Conditions.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.034
They busted a couple
a street dealers who rolled...

18:23.102 --> 18:26.299
and gave up the address of a heroin
cutting room and a scheduled drop.

18:26.372 --> 18:29.398
- We're gonna pull a search warrant and go for it.
- When would that be?

18:29.475 --> 18:32.444
The mechanics and baggers
should be there about 10:00 tonight.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.638
Can everybody make 10:00 work?

18:34.713 --> 18:38.547
- Sure. No problem.
- There goes my Wednesday Glee Club.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.188
I didn't ask for you. We just brought
the information to Lieutenant Fancy...

18:47.259 --> 18:49.625
I got no problem
working with you.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.630
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.267
Okay.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.453
Cell 804 to visitors.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.431
- You can unhook him.
- He went after one of our guys.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.131
He wears iron
as long as he's here.

19:43.382 --> 19:46.613
Here. I went
by, uh, Vitello's.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.888
What you want here, man?

19:52.958 --> 19:57.088
- I'm your friend, Nathan.
- Yeah, you've been a big help so far.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.766
I'm also a cop.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.463
So this is about the hell you've been
through, John, walking that line?

20:05.537 --> 20:08.734
This is about you and how you got
to stop acting like an asshole in here.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.741
I'm acting like an asshole?

20:10.809 --> 20:14.006
While you're sucking fresh air and
bringing me food like a monkey in a zoo,

20:14.079 --> 20:17.105
- you're talking about I'm supposed to behave?
- Somebody's got to.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.377
What was the point
of slugging this guard?

20:19.451 --> 20:22.284
- He put his hands on me.
- That is stupid.

20:22.354 --> 20:27.792
- That is acting like a con.
- Tell me the truth, John.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.794
If you had hit Larry,
would you be in here now?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.955
Better yet, if I was your brother,
would I be in here now?

20:32.031 --> 20:36.730
Nathan, I did what I thought
I had to do on the basketball court.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.362
But for the sake of argument,
let's just say I did let you down.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.736
Is that any excuse to throw away
the rest of your life?

20:41.807 --> 20:45.004
- My life has already been taken away.
- There is a lot we can do.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.477
You never meant to hurt Larry.
You were provoked.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.844
A grand jury, Nathan,
will probably see that.

20:49.915 --> 20:53.681
It's no secret Larry was a loudmouthed
douche bag, may he rest in peace.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.185
Plus, there's the guard.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.451
I'm gonna reach out to him
and maybe he will cut you some slack.

21:01.627 --> 21:04.619
- You think there's a chance of that?
- How bad was it between you two?

21:06.865 --> 21:08.992
I hit him. He got cut.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.042
You know, man,

21:19.778 --> 21:23.441
the last 13 years have been
like a dream or something, man.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.678
Judy and my babies,

21:27.753 --> 21:29.721
the steady gig.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.882
It's no dream, Nathan.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.892
I want 'em back, man.

21:38.897 --> 21:39.829
I want 'em back.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.966
Well, then you gotta stop
messing up in here.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.700
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.867
You all right?
You want the food?

21:54.646 --> 21:56.580
Um...

21:58.450 --> 22:00.577
Just do me a favor, man.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.851
Get me out of here.

22:26.879 --> 22:31.248
This is the police! We have a warrant!
You have ten seconds to open that door!

22:31.316 --> 22:34.217
Eight, nine, ten!
Hit it.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.220
Freeze! Police! Freeze!

22:43.495 --> 22:45.429
Get on the ground!

22:50.969 --> 22:52.903
Gun!

23:01.947 --> 23:03.881
On the ground!

23:20.566 --> 23:24.400
The shooting technique employed
by Detective Kelly this evening...

23:24.470 --> 23:26.768
isn't taught
on the training range.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.773
Yeah, I developed it
personally.

23:28.841 --> 23:33.175
Yeah. This technique is known
as immobilization pattering."

23:33.245 --> 23:37.238
Right? It requires complete control
and command of your weapon.

23:37.316 --> 23:40.308
The idea being
that you peg shots...

23:40.385 --> 23:42.649
around the body perimeter
of the perpetrator,

23:42.721 --> 23:44.985
causing him to freeze up
and become immobile.

23:47.459 --> 23:49.602
Yeah, it grew out
of watching hatchet-throwers...

23:49.736 --> 23:52.227
at carnivals
when I was a kid.

23:53.673 --> 23:55.607
I gotta make a trip.
My round.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.677
- I'm out, Detective.
- Yeah?

23:58.745 --> 24:01.475
My wife gets off shift at the hospital
so I'm gonna pick her up.

24:01.547 --> 24:03.981
- Next time.
- Good work tonight, man.

24:04.050 --> 24:06.348
- Thanks.
- Good work.

24:06.419 --> 24:08.353
What, you eat
a lot of spinach, huh?

24:09.822 --> 24:11.756
- Night.
- See you later.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.754
What do you say?

24:18.364 --> 24:21.333
- Two more.
- All right.

24:21.401 --> 24:23.767
Couple ofbeers
and another club soda.

24:26.472 --> 24:29.600
Well, I've been leaving you alone
like you asked me to.

24:29.676 --> 24:33.669
- And I appreciate it.
- But I've been thinking about you a lot.

24:33.746 --> 24:38.877
I've been thinking about you.
I've been thinking that we should talk.

24:38.951 --> 24:41.749
That's been my inclination
for a while too.

24:43.189 --> 24:46.556
My marriage is over, so...

24:46.626 --> 24:49.686
I've been alone too much,
and it would be nice to...

24:51.431 --> 24:54.594
- have somebody to be with and talk to.
- I know.

24:57.670 --> 25:01.106
The thing is, with Marino
and the other dead guy aside,

25:01.174 --> 25:03.108
my problem is...

25:04.844 --> 25:07.972
- You approached me because he told you to, right?
- Okay.

25:08.047 --> 25:11.574
But we wound up in bed
because I wanted to be there.

25:11.651 --> 25:14.085
- And I wanna believe that.
- Believe it.

25:16.255 --> 25:18.416
What about the two
dead guys in the car?

25:18.491 --> 25:20.425
They told me
to kill you.

25:20.493 --> 25:24.395
I didn't feel like I had any
other choice but to do what I did.

25:24.464 --> 25:27.331
I'm not saying I didn't know
that there were other ways to go.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.925
But with the situation
with my father,

25:30.002 --> 25:33.301
I didn't feel like
I could turn them in.

25:33.373 --> 25:37.639
- I've gone over and over this, and...
- Enough. All right.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.736
I hear ya. I hear ya.

25:44.384 --> 25:48.946
I guess I could take forever
to make my mind up about us, huh?

25:49.021 --> 25:51.489
Meanwhile,
our lives are going by.

25:53.826 --> 25:56.954
You take as much time
as you need, John.

25:57.029 --> 25:58.963
I'm not going anywhere.

25:59.031 --> 26:02.831
- Nice collar, Sipowicz. -
Yeah, thanks. - Hey, Andy.

26:06.372 --> 26:08.306
Bring 'em on.

26:42.375 --> 26:44.309
Oh, Lieutenant.

26:44.377 --> 26:47.141
Uh, canvass of motorists
yesterday you know about.

26:47.213 --> 26:48.874
- No progress?
- No.

26:48.948 --> 26:51.746
Follow-up canvass
of the area's completed.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.309
No witnesses
or information there either.

26:54.387 --> 26:57.686
On Gerald Zimmer, he's got decent
credit, no apparent money problems.

26:57.757 --> 26:59.987
His insurance...
If anything, he's underinsured.

27:00.059 --> 27:03.290
He had a term insurance policy
on himself for $200,000...

27:03.362 --> 27:05.489
and $35,000 on his wife.

27:05.565 --> 27:08.762
- Took those out in May.
- How would you proceed?

27:08.835 --> 27:11.531
If someone made me guess, I'd say it was
a random potshot from another vehicle.

27:11.604 --> 27:14.937
I suppose I'd work up requesting-information
flyers for the neighborhood.

27:15.007 --> 27:17.032
I don't know what else
there'd be to do.

27:17.109 --> 27:20.875
Work up the flyers. Give 'em to the
uniform force to distribute twice a week.

27:20.947 --> 27:24.781
- All right.
- You guys, put yourselves back on the wheel.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.012
- Good, kid.
- Start catching new cases.

27:29.956 --> 27:32.049
- Thanks for the help, Martinez.
- No problem, Lieutenant.

27:32.124 --> 27:34.854
I'm going over
to Nathan's grand jury hearing.

27:34.927 --> 27:37.088
- I hope all that works out.
- Thanks.

27:37.163 --> 27:40.189
Martinez, you got
that work-up on the husband?

27:40.266 --> 27:42.598
- Yeah. I'll take care of it.
- Yeah.

27:42.668 --> 27:44.727
I wanna agitate
this guy a little.

27:44.804 --> 27:49.138
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know. He rubs me the wrong way.

27:49.208 --> 27:52.200
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.313
Ah, Mr. Zimmer.

27:59.385 --> 28:01.876
Detective Sipowicz, 15 squad.

28:01.954 --> 28:04.445
Yeah, how you doing?

28:04.524 --> 28:06.822
No, I wish I could tell you
that there was a breakthrough.

28:06.893 --> 28:10.192
We're just following up
on a few things here.

28:10.263 --> 28:15.462
Listen. We saw that you recently took
out an insurance policy on your wife.

28:15.535 --> 28:18.299
I wanted to ask you
was there a particular...

28:18.371 --> 28:22.774
Hey, Mr. Zimmer,
you wanna ease off on the profanity?

28:22.842 --> 28:26.471
I didn't say that.
No one is accusing you of anything.

28:26.546 --> 28:32.075
We took notice because you took out
that policy on her pretty recently.

28:32.151 --> 28:34.085
Uh-huh.

28:34.153 --> 28:38.146
As a rider on your own policy,
virtually a freebie.

28:38.224 --> 28:43.321
I see. Well, I suppose
that might explain it.

28:43.396 --> 28:47.332
Hey, hey, Mr. Zimmer,
I'm talking to you in a respectful way,

28:47.400 --> 28:49.766
and I'm making
legitimate inquiries here,

28:49.835 --> 28:51.962
so I don't know what you're
getting so excited about.

28:52.038 --> 28:55.701
You don't have anything
to hide, now, do you?

28:55.775 --> 29:00.405
You seem to fly off the handle anytime
anybody wants to talk to you.

29:00.479 --> 29:03.073
No. I didn't say you
had anything to hide.

29:03.149 --> 29:06.880
I said if you don't,
I wonder why you're so irritable.

29:08.354 --> 29:12.188
All right, well,
I'm sorry you feel harassed.

29:12.258 --> 29:14.192
Here you go.

29:14.260 --> 29:17.696
I'll say good-bye now.
All right. Yeah. I'll be in touch.

29:22.635 --> 29:27.595
The other named witnesses and myself were
playing in a three-on-three basketball game.

29:27.673 --> 29:31.575
Most of us are close friends and
the game has been going on for years.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.909
This day there was
a dispute over some calls.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.142
The deceased began
pushing Mr. Foster...

29:37.216 --> 29:39.150
and had become
verbally abusive to him.

29:39.218 --> 29:41.743
When Mr. Foster
attempted to walk away,

29:41.821 --> 29:44.517
the decedent
continued to push.

29:44.590 --> 29:48.856
Finally, Mr. Foster
punched him in the face once.

29:48.928 --> 29:52.728
He went down to the floor
and immediately into arrest.

29:52.798 --> 29:56.495
He was pronounced officially dead
about 20 minutes later.

29:56.569 --> 29:58.867
Detective Kelly, did you
see the decedent assault...

29:58.938 --> 30:00.872
or threaten
Mr. Foster in any way...

30:00.940 --> 30:02.874
prior to Mr. Foster
striking the blow?

30:02.942 --> 30:07.311
The decedent was making racial remarks
and repeatedly pushing Mr. Foster.

30:07.380 --> 30:09.473
Did it appear to you
in your professional capacity...

30:09.548 --> 30:13.746
that Mr. Foster was at risk or felt himself
to be at risk because of this pushing?

30:13.819 --> 30:16.310
That he was attempting
to defend himself.

30:16.389 --> 30:18.482
I don't think he was at risk.

30:18.557 --> 30:20.855
I think he was attempting
to fend off Mr. Kohnstam.

30:20.926 --> 30:24.726
I didn't ask if he was attempting to
fend him off. Was he defending himself?

30:24.797 --> 30:27.994
I wanna be very clear
about what happened here...

30:28.067 --> 30:30.865
because I don't wanna cause these
families any additional undue grief.

30:30.936 --> 30:33.928
This was not a violent
or vicious confrontation.

30:34.006 --> 30:37.703
One man was being verbally provoked
and repeatedly pushed.

30:37.777 --> 30:39.836
He struck a blow
in response to that.

30:39.912 --> 30:43.245
The result was out of all
proportion with the intent.

30:43.315 --> 30:45.749
I made the arrest
because that's my job,

30:45.818 --> 30:47.752
not because I thought
I saw a homicide.

30:47.820 --> 30:51.085
But in answer
to my specific question,

30:51.157 --> 30:53.387
your professional opinion
is that the blow,

30:53.459 --> 30:55.950
while it may have been provoked
by irritation or anger,

30:56.028 --> 30:58.223
was not struck
in self-defense.

31:00.399 --> 31:02.458
Detective.

31:02.535 --> 31:07.598
- I suppose you could say that.
- You're excused, Officer.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.980
- Hey, guys.
- How'd it go in there?

31:16.048 --> 31:20.576
We'll see. You send
the wreath to Seattle?

31:20.653 --> 31:23.087
Yeah. I spoke to Kohnstam's mother.
They got it.

31:23.155 --> 31:27.148
- What was on the card?
- He always had a big mouth."

31:27.226 --> 31:29.558
No, we just put
With Sympathy" and all our names.

31:29.628 --> 31:32.153
- Where's Curly? We need him.
- He said he'd be here.

31:32.231 --> 31:35.394
- Was Nathan in there?
- He's gonna be at the arraignment for the other charge.

31:35.468 --> 31:38.437
I'm gonna find this guard he had
the beef with, but please call Curly.

31:38.504 --> 31:41.837
- We need him here.
- He'll be here, John. He'll be here.

31:43.609 --> 31:45.543
- Call him again, will you?
- All right.

31:51.751 --> 31:54.311
Mr. Zimmer.
What's going on?

31:54.386 --> 31:57.378
What's going on is you're
gonna stop badgering me.

31:57.456 --> 31:59.481
We're gonna put an end
to the persecution...

31:59.558 --> 32:01.492
and the subtle accusations
and the innuendo.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.188
That's a great vocabulary
you got there.

32:04.263 --> 32:08.597
- What's on your mind?
- I've taken a lie detector test, Detective.

32:08.667 --> 32:11.898
I'm giving you the results
and asking you to leave me alone.

32:13.906 --> 32:15.840
Norman Holmgren
gave you the test, huh?

32:15.908 --> 32:18.035
I'm told your department
uses him regularly.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.203
Yeah, we do.
He's a good examiner.

32:20.279 --> 32:24.477
Uh, why don't you come on upstairs
a minute, Mr. Zimmer.

32:24.550 --> 32:27.383
- No, I think we've finished our business, Detective.
- Ah, come on.

32:27.453 --> 32:30.911
We can have a cup of coffee
while I look this over.

32:33.793 --> 32:37.593
Come on. We'll be more
comfortable up there. All right?

32:42.601 --> 32:45.695
Boy, you answered this test
with flying colors, didn't you?

32:45.771 --> 32:48.797
- Yes, I did.
- These needles didn't even budge.

32:48.874 --> 32:52.708
Did you kill your wifeJoan?" No." Examiner's
opinion... subject answered truthfully."

32:52.778 --> 32:55.508
Did you fire a gun?"No."
Answered truthfully."

32:55.581 --> 32:58.846
Were you involved in any way
in a plan to kill your wife?"No."

32:58.918 --> 33:01.079
Did you intend to kill
your wife?"No."

33:01.153 --> 33:05.021
- Subject answered truthfully."
- Subject answered truthfully is right.

33:05.090 --> 33:09.186
- Can I go now?
- You're free to go whenever you want, Mr. Zimmer.

33:09.261 --> 33:12.958
Suppose I set up a test now
down at Police Plaza?

33:13.032 --> 33:15.262
- Could you go downtown with me?
- What kind of a test?

33:15.334 --> 33:17.268
- Another lie detector test.
- What for?

33:17.336 --> 33:20.703
Did you write out the questions
on this test you just took?

33:20.773 --> 33:24.231
This test was administered
by a reputable polygraph examiner.

33:24.310 --> 33:27.939
You still insist on questioning
my honesty? You insist on harassing me?

33:28.013 --> 33:29.981
If it was me, I'd have asked,

33:30.049 --> 33:32.381
Do you know more about your wife's
death than you've told the police?"

33:32.451 --> 33:34.385
That one I definitely
would've had on there.

33:34.453 --> 33:36.944
Read the report.
I was not involved.

33:37.022 --> 33:39.456
What is tearing you up
inside, Mr. Zimmer, huh?

33:39.525 --> 33:42.517
What are you doing here?
What do you need to tell me?

33:42.595 --> 33:44.620
I don't need
to tell you anything.

33:44.697 --> 33:48.064
Now, look, I'm not here
to judge you, Mr. Zimmer.

33:48.133 --> 33:51.125
Maybe you were fooling around on your
wife. Is that what we're talking about?

33:51.203 --> 33:53.933
Did you maybe have
a jealous mistress did this...

33:54.006 --> 33:55.940
and you didn't know anything
that she had planned?

33:56.008 --> 33:59.705
That'd give you the clear polygraph test
and that'd make you feel terrible now.

33:59.778 --> 34:01.678
- Oh, my God.
- Is that what we're talking about?

34:01.747 --> 34:03.681
I did it! I killed her!

34:03.749 --> 34:08.482
Now, I'm informing you right now
that you have a right to an attorney.

34:08.554 --> 34:10.351
- You don't understand.
- Be quiet a second.

34:10.422 --> 34:13.482
If you don't want an attorney,
I have to hear you decline.

34:13.559 --> 34:16.858
I decline an attorney.
I decline.

34:20.065 --> 34:23.626
- Tell me how you killed her.
- She begged me.

34:23.702 --> 34:25.636
She begged me to stop.

34:25.704 --> 34:28.297
- I still killed her.
- What did you do?

34:28.373 --> 34:31.969
A man passed me.
He cut me off.

34:32.043 --> 34:34.103
This is
on the F.D.R. Drive.

34:34.179 --> 34:37.637
The son of a bitch, he cut me off
and he got in front of me.

34:37.716 --> 34:41.379
So I came up on the inside
and I cut back in front of him.

34:41.453 --> 34:43.387
I cut him off
the way he cut me off.

34:43.455 --> 34:46.618
And then this
kept on for a while.

34:46.692 --> 34:50.856
He tried to pass me. I sped up
and trapped him inside of another car.

34:50.929 --> 34:54.764
I guess he got behind me and I slowed
down and trapped him again.

34:54.833 --> 34:57.529
And he's blinking his lights.
He's making obscene gestures,

34:57.603 --> 35:00.367
and she's screaming
at me to stop.

35:00.439 --> 35:03.465
But I lost my temper.

35:03.542 --> 35:07.069
And he came up on the inside, and I
sped up and tried to trap him again.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.376
And the next thing
I knew...

35:14.553 --> 35:17.954
You know the last thing
she said to me?

35:18.023 --> 35:21.823
Your wife and the mother of your child
is in this car. Will you please stop?"

35:23.595 --> 35:26.826
And then
I heard a gunshot,

35:26.899 --> 35:30.164
and my wife's face
is covered with...

35:30.235 --> 35:32.169
blood.

35:36.475 --> 35:38.409
Can you help us with the guy?

35:39.712 --> 35:41.646
Yes. I saw him.

35:43.615 --> 35:45.549
I got the license plate.

35:46.685 --> 35:48.983
I was too ashamed
to tell you.

35:57.830 --> 36:00.993
- Yeah. No.
- You got him?

36:01.066 --> 36:03.534
- Thanks a lot.
- Got him.

36:03.602 --> 36:06.799
- Is that the guy who wasted Zimmer's wife?
- And the gun.

36:06.872 --> 36:09.602
So, how'd you make out
with Nathan?

36:09.675 --> 36:11.643
Grand jury didn't indict.

36:11.710 --> 36:16.738
- Medical Examiner found a dissecting aneurysm.
- What's that in English?

36:16.815 --> 36:19.340
The poor bastard's aorta blew up
like a cheap balloon.

36:19.418 --> 36:21.772
- He could've died coughing.
- So your pal's off the hook.

36:21.906 --> 36:24.670
- Except for the assault
on the corrections officer.

36:26.343 --> 36:28.573
Kelly.

36:28.646 --> 36:31.206
Yeah. Okay.
I'll be right there.

36:31.282 --> 36:33.216
I'll be back.

36:39.723 --> 36:41.657
- You Kelly?
- Yeah.

36:41.725 --> 36:44.250
I'm Hardwick, Corrections.
What can I do for you?

36:44.328 --> 36:46.660
- How's the eye?
- Couple of stitches, headache.

36:46.730 --> 36:48.994
- I've been there before.
- I wanted to talk to you about that.

36:49.066 --> 36:52.001
Why? You don't have the paper on it.
It's in the 5th Precinct.

36:52.069 --> 36:54.799
Yeah, I know.
And I spoke to Detective Lugo...

36:54.872 --> 36:57.807
and he knows
that I reached out to you.

37:00.744 --> 37:02.609
Nathan Foster
is a friend of mine.

37:02.680 --> 37:06.377
- The guy who hit me?
- Yeah. I wanted to see if I can explain things to you.

37:06.450 --> 37:10.113
Like what? He's sorry? He didn't
mean it? He'll never do it again?

37:10.187 --> 37:13.782
He's a postal worker and a family man,
and he's living a clean life.

37:13.858 --> 37:17.055
Me too. I got all
those things too.

37:17.127 --> 37:19.186
Does that make it okay for me
to take a piece out of you?

37:19.263 --> 37:22.061
You're pissed off.
I understand that. I would be too.

37:22.132 --> 37:24.566
I looked this guy up.
He's been in jail before.

37:24.635 --> 37:27.661
- As a teenager.
- My point is, the guy was no virgin.

37:27.738 --> 37:30.571
He knew how it works.
He broke the big one.

37:30.641 --> 37:33.701
He hit the man."
And I ain't here to be hit or damaged.

37:33.777 --> 37:38.305
- I know that and he does too.
- You're sure of that, huh?

37:38.382 --> 37:40.316
You know what's
in this guy's mind?

37:40.384 --> 37:45.253
Hardwick, this guy was looking
at his whole life going down the drain.

37:45.322 --> 37:49.554
He went off for a second. The charges
that brought him in have been dismissed.

37:49.627 --> 37:52.926
Do you think you can find it
in your heart to cut him a break?

37:54.465 --> 37:57.229
See you in court.

38:05.009 --> 38:06.943
Mr. Zimmer,
whenever you're ready.

38:07.011 --> 38:10.003
If you recognize anyone,
just give us his number.

38:21.258 --> 38:24.250
Four. Number four.

38:24.328 --> 38:26.796
How do you know
this man?

38:26.864 --> 38:29.765
- That's the man that shot my wife.
- You're sure?

38:29.833 --> 38:32.028
I'm sure.

38:32.102 --> 38:34.036
Get a D.A.
Start the paperwork.

38:34.104 --> 38:37.665
Hell of a job.
Thanks for your cooperation.

38:39.710 --> 38:41.644
Mr. Zimmer, let's go.

38:41.712 --> 38:43.907
Just let me have
a minute, all right?

38:43.981 --> 38:46.711
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:46.784 --> 38:48.718
All right.

38:57.027 --> 38:59.291
- You killed my wife!
- Mr. Zimmer!

38:59.363 --> 39:03.697
- You killed my wife, you...
- Hey!

39:03.767 --> 39:07.498
- You shot her in the face.
- You should have pulled over and let me pass.

39:07.571 --> 39:10.836
- I got as much right to be on that road as you do.
- Up yours, pal.

39:10.908 --> 39:12.842
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey!

39:12.910 --> 39:16.073
You guys want me to get a couple
of those kiddie car steering wheels...

39:16.146 --> 39:19.411
and you can go
at it again, huh?

39:25.756 --> 39:29.522
- Officer, do you swear to the truth of the affidavit?
- I do.

39:29.593 --> 39:31.527
Charges are felonious
assault and escape.

39:31.595 --> 39:34.086
Your Honor, the People have agreed
to drop the charge of escape.

39:34.164 --> 39:37.224
- Motions as to the assault?
- The People wish to proceed as a felony.

39:37.301 --> 39:41.670
- Objection, Your Honor.
- I'll schedule a hearing for late next week.

39:41.739 --> 39:45.004
Bail is 20,000.
Can you make that, Mr. Foster?

39:45.075 --> 39:47.669
No, I cannot, Your Honor.

39:47.745 --> 39:50.373
Um,

39:50.447 --> 39:52.540
can I say something,
Your Honor?

39:52.616 --> 39:54.550
I'll give you
a minute's grace...

39:54.618 --> 39:57.917
and advise you and your attorney
that any statements are for the record.

39:57.988 --> 40:00.718
Thank you, Your Honor.

40:00.791 --> 40:06.696
I was involved in a fight with a friend
a few days ago, and he died.

40:06.764 --> 40:09.289
You face no charges here
but assault on a prison guard,

40:09.366 --> 40:11.596
- Mr. Foster.
- I know that, Your Honor.

40:11.669 --> 40:13.694
And as much as I would like,

40:13.771 --> 40:18.037
I can't relive that day
or bring that person back,

40:18.108 --> 40:22.306
even though the grand jury
found that it wasn't my fault.

40:22.379 --> 40:25.906
Then, uh,
this man, the guard,

40:25.983 --> 40:28.884
who was just doing his job,
I understand that...

40:28.952 --> 40:32.353
But he was putting me
back into a life...

40:32.423 --> 40:34.789
I felt I had earned
my way out of...

40:36.427 --> 40:39.988
and I got very scared,
and I tried to get away.

40:41.598 --> 40:43.828
I should've never hit him.

40:43.901 --> 40:48.338
And for that,
I am deeply sorry. I apologize.

40:52.543 --> 40:54.477
But, Your Honor,
I'm asking,

40:56.513 --> 40:58.447
can I have my family back?

41:00.584 --> 41:03.109
Can I have my life back?

41:04.621 --> 41:07.089
I've tried very hard
to make a life.

41:09.393 --> 41:11.327
Please.

41:25.309 --> 41:27.777
Your Honor, the People are willing
to reduce the charge...

41:27.845 --> 41:31.781
to misdemeanor assault, and they have
no objection to parole.

41:31.849 --> 41:35.376
Paroled, pending
a hearing or plea.

41:36.787 --> 41:39.312
- Great.
- Thanks so much for your help.

41:39.389 --> 41:41.482
Congratulations.

41:48.732 --> 41:50.666
- Thanks.
- Okay.

42:28.105 --> 42:30.096
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

42:30.174 --> 42:33.268
It's been five weeks
since my last confession.

42:33.343 --> 42:35.573
These are my sins.

42:35.646 --> 42:38.513
For your own good,
which is God's glory,

42:38.582 --> 42:43.076
I think you should try to get
in here a little more often, hmm?

42:43.153 --> 42:45.781
This situation that
you're familiar with...

42:47.024 --> 42:49.857
I'm glad it's resolved.

42:49.927 --> 42:54.159
Well, starting off with a death the way
it did, that was terrible enough.

42:54.231 --> 42:56.165
It didn't need
to get any worse.

42:57.901 --> 43:02.668
I wanted to talk to you
about something else.

43:02.739 --> 43:04.673
Uh-huh.

43:06.577 --> 43:09.637
I know the church still
regards me as married,

43:09.713 --> 43:12.705
and I've been
working on it.

43:12.783 --> 43:16.719
You know that.
But it's not gonna work out.

43:16.787 --> 43:19.415
Are you interested
in someone else?

43:19.489 --> 43:21.423
I'm not sure.

43:23.026 --> 43:24.857
I mean, yeah, I am.

43:24.928 --> 43:27.658
The doctrine is
to work on your marriage.

43:27.731 --> 43:29.665
And I have been.

43:30.834 --> 43:33.496
But Laura
and I know that...

43:33.570 --> 43:35.504
it's not gonna work.

43:36.907 --> 43:41.241
Well, your involvement with
this other woman, is it, uh...

43:41.311 --> 43:44.337
The other woman, in terms
of my romantic interest for her,

43:44.414 --> 43:46.348
I don't wanna talk
about that right now.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.350
In what terms then?

43:50.754 --> 43:52.688
Well, she's a good person.

43:53.991 --> 43:55.925
But certain events
have taken place,

43:55.993 --> 43:59.451
and she's ended up doing something
that most people would thing is wrong.

43:59.529 --> 44:01.463
Do you think it's wrong?

44:03.133 --> 44:05.499
- Yeah, I do.
- Does she?

44:06.970 --> 44:10.462
So far she seems okay with it.

44:10.540 --> 44:14.169
If she's the good person you say she is,
she can't be okay with it. You know that.

44:14.244 --> 44:18.010
- I don't know that.
- Well, I think that's why you're here.

44:18.081 --> 44:22.040
- Well, what exactly did she do?
- I don't wanna talk about that.

44:22.119 --> 44:24.815
- A venial sin? A mortal sin? What?
- I can't say.

44:24.888 --> 44:26.981
I'm your priest.
What do you mean, you can't say?

44:27.057 --> 44:28.991
- I can't say.
- Well, come back here...

44:29.059 --> 44:31.823
when you're ready to stop
acting like a tube steak.

44:38.135 --> 44:40.330
John.

44:40.404 --> 44:43.703
I, uh, expressed myself
inappropriately,

44:43.774 --> 44:45.708
and, uh, I regret it.

44:47.444 --> 44:52.313
Because you're my friend, you have
a special way of pissing me off.

44:52.382 --> 44:54.816
I know.

44:57.454 --> 44:59.581
You see, in there,

44:59.656 --> 45:02.625
I'm God's priest
and intermediary.

45:04.127 --> 45:06.618
You come
to confession with God,

45:08.165 --> 45:10.360
you come
with an open heart,

45:11.802 --> 45:14.828
which I know you can do.

45:16.773 --> 45:19.708
- I'll keep working on it.
- I know you will.

45:19.776 --> 45:21.710
Whoo.

45:23.046 --> 45:24.980
Ahh!

45:25.048 --> 45:27.175
- Hello, Father.
- Gladys, hi.

45:28.485 --> 45:32.319
I do believe I have
a special vocation for the game.

45:32.389 --> 45:37.850
Curly, I think you have a special
vocation for everything you do.

45:39.763 --> 45:42.391
We might as well start
with a little two-on-two.

45:42.466 --> 45:46.368
- Nathan won't show.
- Come on, man. Let's wait awhile.

45:46.436 --> 45:48.563
He will be here.

45:48.638 --> 45:51.869
- What makes you think so?
- Because I think so.

45:51.942 --> 45:54.001
Even if he shows up,
we'll need a sixth.

45:54.077 --> 45:56.011
We'll never find
the right guy.

45:56.079 --> 45:58.013
Doc, let me ask
you something.

45:58.081 --> 46:00.413
You ever have
a positive thought?

46:00.484 --> 46:02.679
Cancer specialists
don't tend to be optimists.

46:02.753 --> 46:04.812
Look who's here, guys.

46:04.888 --> 46:07.049
Hey, guy.

46:07.124 --> 46:09.058
- Nathan.
- Hey, how you doing?

46:09.126 --> 46:11.060
- Good to see you.
- Thanks. You too.

46:11.128 --> 46:13.062
- What's happenin'?
- Good to see you.

46:13.130 --> 46:15.598
Yeah. What's up, bub?

46:17.901 --> 46:20.836
- Who's side you on?
- Against you.

46:20.904 --> 46:23.464
For a little while anyway.

46:23.540 --> 46:25.508
We need a sixth man.

46:25.575 --> 46:27.702
Hey, fella, you play?

46:27.778 --> 46:29.712
Not very well.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.941
But that never
stopped you guys.

46:32.015 --> 46:33.949
- Oh! Come
on. - Oh! - Oh!

46:34.017 --> 46:35.951
He's gonna be hurt.

46:36.019 --> 46:38.249
We'll take him.
He'll fit right in.

46:38.321 --> 46:41.313
Check it out. Check it out.
Check it out. Check it out.

46:41.391 --> 46:43.791
Give it back.
Check it out one more time.

46:43.860 --> 46:46.294
One more check.
Give it one more check.

46:46.363 --> 46:48.297
Watch this guy.

47:16.493 --> 47:19.951
- Hey.
- Hey.
