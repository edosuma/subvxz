09:55.500 --> 09:58.125
-[footsteps approach]
-[Molly] What's going on, Mum?

09:58.208 --> 10:01.958
Why can't I go up my tree anymore?
What's this meeting about?

10:02.041 --> 10:04.125
It's nothing, Molly.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.416
It's, um, just…

10:06.500 --> 10:09.875
There's some quite big wasps
up there this year.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.666
[sighs] Really?

10:11.750 --> 10:16.083
Besides, I need someone to stay here
and look after your dad.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.333
[grunts]

10:17.416 --> 10:18.916
[yells, strains]

10:19.000 --> 10:21.291
[yelps, groans]

10:21.375 --> 10:23.375
Don't worry. I'm good.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.416
[giggles] Okay.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.708
Maybe while you're out,
he can tell me a story.

10:28.791 --> 10:29.875
Good idea.

10:30.833 --> 10:33.083
Good night, my big, brave girl.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.791
[gentle flute music playing]

10:36.875 --> 10:39.416
-[Molly giggles]
-[Rocky] Good night, Ginge. Good luck.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.333
Okay, Mollypod. What do you wanna do?

10:43.416 --> 10:49.041
Well, I thought
you could tell me about… this.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.833
Oh! [chuckles sheepishly]

10:51.916 --> 10:56.291
Uh, uh, uh, that… that is… not me.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.375
[whimsical music playing]

11:02.583 --> 11:07.625
Okay. Yes, it's me.
But it was a long time ago.

11:08.625 --> 11:09.875
And?

11:10.375 --> 11:11.375
And,

11:12.500 --> 11:13.750
actually,

11:14.666 --> 11:17.291
it's a… it's a pretty good story.

11:17.791 --> 11:19.166
[chickens chattering inside]

11:19.250 --> 11:21.083
[hen 1] It's not just eggs
they want from us.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.083
[Bunty] Ginger has that look about her.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.416
I reckon she'll have us charging
right into the fray.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.000
I don't want to charge into any frays.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.500
I… I'm fray-phobic.

11:30.583 --> 11:34.416
-All right, everyone! Please, quiet!
-[hen 2] Wait. She's starting.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.250
-[Ginger] Quiet!
-[hen 2] Shut your beak.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.750
-[chatter dies down]
-Now, we all know about the new road.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.041
-[tense music playing]
-[chickens murmuring]

11:42.125 --> 11:47.083
And the trucks taking chickens
to what looks like some kind of farm.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.333
A farm? [clucks nervously]

11:49.416 --> 11:51.916
No, it's all right, Beryl. Listen. Listen.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.208
We know from experience
what that can mean.

11:55.291 --> 11:56.125
[yelps]

11:56.208 --> 11:58.791
It's something we just can't ignore.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.958
[tense music building]

12:00.041 --> 12:02.875
We really only have one choice.

12:02.958 --> 12:05.000
[shudders] I don't want to hear it.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.708
We've got to do something.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.125
-[chickens clamoring]
-[chomps]

12:08.208 --> 12:09.541
[music stops suddenly]

12:09.625 --> 12:11.125
We have to hide.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.791
-[Babs] Ah?
-[chickens] Huh?

12:12.875 --> 12:14.083
[hen 3 gulps]

12:14.875 --> 12:15.833
Hide?

12:15.916 --> 12:17.708
Yes. Hide!

12:17.791 --> 12:20.583
-[wing pops free]
-You mean, pretend we're not here?

12:21.250 --> 12:22.166
Exactly.

12:22.666 --> 12:24.541
[uneasy string music playing]

12:27.250 --> 12:31.583
-[chickens cheering]
-[music grows triumphant]

12:31.666 --> 12:34.833
Operation Lie Low. Jolly good.

12:34.916 --> 12:38.250
Ooh! I like lilos.
Especially the stripy ones.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.500
She's right, you know.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.958
-It's really not our problem.
-[hen 4 laughs] Oh, you!

12:42.041 --> 12:43.708
Are you all right, hen?

12:44.416 --> 12:47.083
It's not like you to shy away from danger.

12:47.583 --> 12:51.000
I know, but I have Molly
to think about now.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.083
And I…

12:52.166 --> 12:54.375
We can't risk our freedom

12:54.458 --> 12:57.583
by venturing into a world
that finds chickens so…

12:59.333 --> 13:00.458
delicious.

13:02.375 --> 13:05.666
-[hens panting]
-[energetic orchestral music playing]

13:08.875 --> 13:09.958
Lift!

13:10.041 --> 13:13.125
-[hens straining]
-[pulleys squeaking]

13:13.208 --> 13:14.666
[leaves rustle]

13:14.750 --> 13:16.458
[birds singing]

13:16.541 --> 13:19.500
-[orchestral music swells, fades]
-[frog croaks]

13:19.583 --> 13:21.000
[Ginger] Right.

13:21.083 --> 13:25.333
All we have to do now is keep quiet
and not draw attention to ourselves.

13:25.416 --> 13:29.250
-[loudly] Cock-a-doodle-doo!
-[group gasps]

13:29.750 --> 13:32.000
-[joints crack]
-[Rocky grunts]

13:32.083 --> 13:33.750
-[clears throat]
-[inhales deeply]

13:33.833 --> 13:35.083
[Ginger, hushed] Rocky!

13:35.166 --> 13:41.333
Um, given our new situation,
maybe you shouldn't crow anymore.

13:41.416 --> 13:44.000
[exhales, coughs]

13:44.083 --> 13:45.791
[gasps] Don't crow?

13:45.875 --> 13:48.416
[chuckles] What?
But that's, like, my thing.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.958
Maybe you could do a different thing.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.041
A quieter one?

13:52.125 --> 13:53.875
[Molly] Wow! Look at this!

13:53.958 --> 13:55.708
Molly! Get away from that.

13:55.791 --> 13:59.333
-Ginge, can we talk about the whole…
-[Fowler] She's right, you know.

13:59.416 --> 14:00.625
[tense music plays]

14:00.708 --> 14:04.666
-[yelps]
-Careless squawks cost lives.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.458
We have to lie low.

14:06.958 --> 14:09.750
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.708
If you can find me.

14:14.583 --> 14:15.791
-[Fowler yelps]
-[hens] Ooh.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.583
[Molly] What's it for, Mum?

14:21.750 --> 14:23.583
[chickens clucking inside truck]

14:23.666 --> 14:26.166
[gasps] Oh! What is that?

14:26.250 --> 14:27.916
[chickens clucking loudly]

14:28.833 --> 14:31.500
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.333
It's doing this.

14:33.416 --> 14:35.375
[giggles] Oh, that's so funny.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.791
Uh, let's go home.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.666
[Molly sighs]

14:40.416 --> 14:41.458
[chuckles softly]

14:42.458 --> 14:45.000
Where are they going?
[gasps] Can we go with them?

14:45.083 --> 14:47.333
-It looks like a lot of fun.
-I'm sorry, Molly.

14:47.416 --> 14:49.791
-You're not ready to go off the island.
-But I…

14:49.875 --> 14:52.458
Uh, Rocky? Little help?

14:52.541 --> 14:54.916
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.375
Why am I not ready?

14:56.458 --> 14:57.750
I'm a big, brave girl.

14:57.833 --> 15:00.000
-You always say so.
-I know.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.708
But you're still a child.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.166
Says who?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.375
Says me and your dad.

15:05.458 --> 15:06.541
Right, Rocky?

15:06.625 --> 15:09.958
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom, kiddo.

15:10.041 --> 15:13.958
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

15:14.041 --> 15:15.500
Something that's a little shorter.

15:15.583 --> 15:20.833
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

15:20.916 --> 15:22.166
Like Dad was.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.166
[both gasp]

15:23.250 --> 15:24.583
I've seen his poster.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.708
Ah.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.416
He used to live over there,
and you did too.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.250
-[Ginger gasps]
-[laughs nonchalantly, clears throat]

15:31.333 --> 15:34.291
Did I say that? I don't… I don't remember.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.375
That's it.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.875
Molly, you are not leaving this island.

15:37.958 --> 15:40.833
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.083
Actually, I am.

15:43.833 --> 15:48.458
Look, Molly, you've got
everything you want right here.

15:48.541 --> 15:50.583
Except for one thing.

15:50.666 --> 15:51.958
And what's that?

15:53.833 --> 15:55.083
Freedom.

15:55.583 --> 15:56.708
[Ginger gasps]

15:56.791 --> 15:58.541
[footsteps retreat]

16:01.083 --> 16:02.083
[door slams]

16:02.166 --> 16:06.458
-[Ginger sighs]
-You know, she is a lot like you.

16:06.541 --> 16:09.708
[Ginger gasps, sighs] Mm.

16:10.875 --> 16:14.375
-[owl hooting]
-[tense music playing]

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
[vehicle approaching]

16:22.250 --> 16:23.333
[brakes screech]

16:23.416 --> 16:27.000
[chickens clucking inside truck]

16:29.583 --> 16:31.583
[tense music building]

16:32.708 --> 16:33.791
[Ginger gasps]

16:33.875 --> 16:36.625
[Mrs. Tweedy, distorted] Your daughter
is going to be delicious!

16:36.708 --> 16:39.500
-[Ginger screams]
-[yelps] Not the face! Not the face!

16:39.583 --> 16:42.166
-[groans, grunts]
-[gasps]

16:43.291 --> 16:45.625
-Huh?
-[gasps] Molly?

16:46.208 --> 16:47.666
-[gasps]
-[Rocky gasps]

16:47.750 --> 16:50.291
-[ominous music playing]
-[hens calling] Molly?

16:50.375 --> 16:51.916
-[hen 1] Come out, Molly!
-[hen 2] Molly!

16:52.000 --> 16:53.250
-[hen 3] Molly?
-[Babs] Molly?

16:53.333 --> 16:54.625
-[Bunty] Molly!
-[Fetcher] Molly!

16:54.708 --> 16:56.333
-[Ginger] Molly?
-Molly!

16:56.416 --> 16:58.000
-[Ginger gasps]
-[Fowler] Come out, Molly.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.833
-[Rocky gasps]
-[Ginger cries out]

16:59.916 --> 17:02.916
[both panting]

17:03.000 --> 17:05.041
[ominous music swells]

17:06.375 --> 17:07.208
[Ginger] No!

17:07.291 --> 17:10.500
-She's left the island.
-[crowd clamoring]

17:10.583 --> 17:13.291
-[tense music playing]
-[bird calling in distance]

17:16.000 --> 17:17.541
[Molly] This isn't so bad.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.666
Don't know what Mum was worried about.

17:19.750 --> 17:23.208
[chuckles nervously]
I'm big and I'm brave.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.708
Yeah, course I am.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.666
[shakily] I'm big… [whimpers]

17:28.750 --> 17:29.833
-And…
-[low growl]

17:29.916 --> 17:31.458
[gasps] …not very brave.

17:31.541 --> 17:33.875
-[creature snarls]
-[screams]

17:33.958 --> 17:36.791
-[sinister orchestral music playing]

-[music fades]
-[crickets chirping]

17:44.500 --> 17:45.833
[owl hoots in distance]

17:46.333 --> 17:47.333
Huh?

17:47.416 --> 17:49.083
[tense strings building]

17:50.458 --> 17:51.333
Hmm?

17:52.083 --> 17:53.541
[Molly yelps]

17:53.625 --> 17:55.000
[groans weakly]

17:55.500 --> 17:57.708
[panting, gasps]

17:57.791 --> 18:00.750
What were you doin'?
Have you got a death wish?

18:00.833 --> 18:02.083
No.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.833
Wait, what's a death wish?

18:09.208 --> 18:12.375
Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out, baby girl?

18:12.458 --> 18:14.375
I'm not a baby girl.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.750
I'm a… I'm a big, brave girl.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.333
And isn't it a bit late
for you to be out too?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.208
[chuckles] Okay, I like it.

18:25.708 --> 18:27.166
Give as good as you get, eh?

18:27.666 --> 18:29.791
Well, I'm Frizzle.

18:30.833 --> 18:32.083
And you are?

18:33.416 --> 18:34.291
Molly.

18:34.791 --> 18:36.750
[sighs] Although,
it's kind of a goofy name.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.416
So I'm thinking of changing it to…

18:38.500 --> 18:39.458
Zip it, kidda.

18:39.541 --> 18:42.625
-It's stoppin'. Now's our chance.
-[brakes screech]

18:44.208 --> 18:46.791
-Are you comin' or not?
-Coming where?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.916
To the happy chicken truck.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.791
[gasps] You've seen them too?

18:50.875 --> 18:52.333
Right.

18:52.416 --> 18:53.500
[Molly giggles]

18:53.583 --> 18:55.625
Wherever that truck's goin',

18:55.708 --> 18:58.958
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

18:59.541 --> 19:02.083
Uh, what's a toenail?

19:02.708 --> 19:04.041
What's a penguin?

19:04.125 --> 19:08.041
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.875
[sighs] Wait for me!

19:12.666 --> 19:15.916
I mean, so she found my poster,
and I told her a story.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.291
I don't think that's such a big deal.

19:18.375 --> 19:21.541
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

19:21.625 --> 19:23.375
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

19:23.458 --> 19:26.041
You know, if you had it your way,
she'd still be in her shell.

19:26.125 --> 19:29.041
Well, better in her shell
than out on the open road.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.666
So, do you live on an island too?

19:32.750 --> 19:35.833
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

19:35.916 --> 19:39.208
Then the trucks came,
and they said I was too small to go.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.750
But that's not gonna stop me.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.625
You get to sit in a bucket.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.333
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

19:45.416 --> 19:47.250
I want a bucket.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.708
The thing about us, Mol,

19:48.791 --> 19:52.458
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

19:52.541 --> 19:55.875
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.625
Me and you, kidda. All the way.

19:59.708 --> 20:00.916
[Molly chuckles]

20:01.000 --> 20:03.333
[hens clucking]

20:04.291 --> 20:05.916
Holy moly.

[yelps] Oh!

20:19.625 --> 20:21.666
What is that?

20:22.166 --> 20:24.375
You've never seen a human before?

20:26.083 --> 20:28.041
We had them back at the farm.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.083
[quietly] They're kinda stupid.

20:30.166 --> 20:33.708
They fed us and tidied up after us.
They're basically like waitin' staff.

20:33.791 --> 20:34.958
Oi!

20:35.041 --> 20:36.250
-Oi, you!
-Huh?

20:36.750 --> 20:38.625
How did you two get out here?

20:38.708 --> 20:40.750
-What do you say, Molly?
-[Molly] Uh…

20:40.833 --> 20:43.541
Do you want to come
on the adventure of a lifetime or not?

21:14.625 --> 21:15.916
I know what you're thinking.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.583
Where are the buckets?

21:18.083 --> 21:20.250
I bet they give 'em to us
when we get there.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.458
-Are we nearly there yet?
-Molly!

21:23.541 --> 21:25.291

We mustn't panic.

23:16.250 --> 23:18.083
-No. No panicking.
-I don't like it.

23:18.166 --> 23:21.625
It's a perfect time to panic.
The enemy has the upper hand.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.208
We must keep our heads!

23:23.291 --> 23:25.958
-Where should we keep them?
-[splutters] I'm trying to think here.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.583
-No panicking. No. I said no panicking!
-[Ginger sighs]

23:28.666 --> 23:31.583
-Ginger, what do you say?
-[Bunty] What did I say?

23:34.166 --> 23:38.833
I say, last time,
we broke out of a chicken farm.

23:39.333 --> 23:42.708
Well, this time, we're breaking in.

-[surf rock ends]
-[excited chatter fades]

25:15.291 --> 25:17.708
Listen, everyone. We can do this.

25:17.791 --> 25:20.458
-We just need a really clever plan.
-Ooh. Ooh.

25:20.541 --> 25:22.291
Okay. I've got this. I've got this.

25:23.291 --> 25:28.333
[slowly] I'm gonna go in there,
and I'm gonna bust Molly out.

25:28.833 --> 25:31.791
And just how the bloomin' heck
are you going to do that?

25:32.500 --> 25:37.500
Well, by, uh… uh, y'know, going in there

25:37.583 --> 25:40.000
and then… busting her out.

25:41.041 --> 25:42.958
That's not a plan.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.083
That's just saying
what you wish would happen.

25:45.166 --> 25:46.916
Aye, and 12 herrings and a bagpipe

25:47.000 --> 25:50.166
are just a pile of mince
if you havnae kent the rules.

25:50.250 --> 25:52.791
You know,
that sounded a little negative to me.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.250
Mac's right. We need more details.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.625
We only get one shot at this,
so we need to make sure

25:58.708 --> 26:02.291
that every move we make
is carefully thought through.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.000
We can't just rush in and…

What are you doing?

26:11.083 --> 26:13.916
Sometimes you just gotta take a leap,
Ginger.

26:14.791 --> 26:16.375
-You ready, Fowler?
-Ready.

Ooh, that went well.

27:41.916 --> 27:42.875
[Ginger groans]

27:42.958 --> 27:45.333
Well, one good thing.

27:45.833 --> 27:47.791
At least now we've got the details.

27:47.875 --> 27:51.416
[sighs] Right.
We're gonna need some backup.

27:51.916 --> 27:53.250
[gulls calling]

27:53.333 --> 27:57.416
No way. That place is impenetrable.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.125
Yeah, and you can't get in neither.

-[jaunty music playing]
-[scoffs]

28:01.333 --> 28:02.750
It's an impossible mission.

Uh, shouldn't it be the other way around?

28:06.000 --> 28:08.750
[sighs] Don't be a 'nana, Fetch.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.083
I know it looks
like a million-to-one shot,

28:11.166 --> 28:14.458
but we know the layout,
and Mac thinks there's a way in.

28:14.541 --> 28:16.916
This is Fun Land Farm.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.166
Oh!

28:18.250 --> 28:20.833
It's much smaller than I expected.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.000
Uh, thanks, Babs.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.250
There's a wee side door in a blind spot.

28:27.833 --> 28:29.833
With a cheeky wee trick to open it.

28:29.916 --> 28:31.125
[scanner whirs, chirps]

28:32.375 --> 28:35.375
So, only the small matter
of this electric fence.

28:35.458 --> 28:36.500
All these guards.

28:36.583 --> 28:38.750
The camera-driven gun-toting moles.

28:38.833 --> 28:41.916
And the laser-guided exploding ducks.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.583
Please. You've got to help us.
Rocky's in there.

28:45.666 --> 28:47.125
Ah, shame. I quite liked him.

28:47.208 --> 28:48.833
And so is Molly.

28:49.541 --> 28:51.541
Molly? Our little niece? [gasps]

28:51.625 --> 28:52.833
Steady, mate.

-Stay strong.

-So you're in?
-[splutters] Just tell us what you need.

-Anything for our little Molly!

29:07.541 --> 29:09.000
[resolute music playing]

29:09.083 --> 29:10.666
We can do this, everyone.

29:10.750 --> 29:15.083
Bunty, with your strength, my love,
we can move mountains.

29:15.166 --> 29:16.666
Mac, you're the brains.

29:17.666 --> 29:21.208
Babs, you're our… wool specialist.

29:21.291 --> 29:22.291
Ah.

29:22.375 --> 29:23.291
Nick and Fetch,

29:23.375 --> 29:26.500
you're the sneakiest little toerags
this side of the Dales.

29:26.583 --> 29:27.791
Oh. [sniffles]

29:27.875 --> 29:29.916
-You're too kind.
-[chuckles] Flatterer.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.458
And, Fowler, with your wisdom
and vigilance…

29:33.541 --> 29:35.541
-[music stops]
-Fowler?

29:35.625 --> 29:37.250
[snoring]

29:38.458 --> 29:43.125
Ooh. [splutters] And then the second wave
of bombers approach the target,

29:43.208 --> 29:45.083
and that's where I come in.

29:46.125 --> 29:50.375
Actually, Fowler,
we need to find something special for you.

29:50.458 --> 29:52.791
-[whimsical music playing]
-Ah, right.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.500
How about… getaway man?

29:55.583 --> 29:58.000
Getaway man, eh?

29:58.083 --> 30:01.250
Hmm. [clicks tongue] Sounds important.

30:01.750 --> 30:02.916
I like it.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.333
Right. Let's gather what we need
and hurry.

30:06.833 --> 30:09.458
Who knows what horrors
Molly is dealing with in there.

-It's the most amazin' place ever.
-[Molly sighs]

30:23.416 --> 30:25.333
And my mum said that's where we live.

30:25.416 --> 30:26.541
[scoffs] Yeah, right.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.375
Are the streets paved
with marshmallows where you live?

30:29.958 --> 30:31.791
Can ya bounce on them?

30:31.875 --> 30:35.125
-No! They're paved with dirt.
-[upbeat music playing]

30:35.208 --> 30:38.375
-[Molly grunts]
-Can you lie around doin' nothin' all day?

30:38.458 --> 30:40.250
Actually, my dad can.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.583
Well, everyone can do that here. [gasps]

30:43.666 --> 30:45.208
Wow.

30:45.958 --> 30:49.208
I've heard of this,
but I never knew it actually existed.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.166
Cool. What is it?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.791
All-you-can-eat buffet.

43:09.125 --> 43:11.333
-Whee!
-[gasps]

43:12.250 --> 43:13.125
[whimpers]

43:16.083 --> 43:18.750
-[Molly crying]
-[collared hens babbling]

43:25.333 --> 43:26.250
[Molly] No.

43:27.416 --> 43:28.666
[softly] I'm big…

43:29.375 --> 43:32.125
-[bold music playing]
-[sniffles]

43:32.208 --> 43:33.583
…and I'm brave.

43:34.083 --> 43:36.041
-[spring rider squeaks]
-[Molly] Frizzle.

43:36.125 --> 43:39.000
[quietly] Listen. I'm going to find out
what's going on here.

43:39.083 --> 43:40.666
Then I will be back.

43:40.750 --> 43:42.291
I promise.

43:43.125 --> 43:45.125
[suspenseful music playing]

43:46.416 --> 43:47.416
Huh?

43:52.666 --> 43:53.958
[grunts]

43:54.041 --> 43:55.500
[yelps, sighs]

43:55.583 --> 43:56.708
[groans]

43:56.791 --> 43:58.125
[takes a deep breath]

43:59.333 --> 44:00.458
Huh?

44:02.416 --> 44:04.333
[softly] Whoa.

44:08.166 --> 44:09.375
-[door opens]
-[gasps]

44:10.166 --> 44:12.250
-[grunts]
-[man humming]

44:16.166 --> 44:17.500
-[monitor beeps]
-[man gasps]

44:17.583 --> 44:21.000
Dr. Fry, your guest has arrived.

44:21.583 --> 44:24.541
[Fry gasps] Sir Eat-a-Lot.

44:25.541 --> 44:26.541
Right.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.833
It's showtime.

44:30.166 --> 44:32.166
[suspenseful music playing]

44:37.291 --> 44:40.666
Ah, Sir Eat-a-Lot! Welcome. [chuckles]

44:40.750 --> 44:43.416
What an honor
to have a knight of the realm with us.

44:43.500 --> 44:46.250
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant.

44:46.333 --> 44:48.416
My name is… Oh.

44:50.125 --> 44:52.000
[yelps, chuckles]

44:52.083 --> 44:53.291
[Molly gasps]

44:57.500 --> 44:58.458
Oh.

45:01.041 --> 45:03.166
[splutters] Here at Fun Land Farms,

45:03.250 --> 45:08.208
we do everything we can
to make our chickens feel right at home.

45:10.375 --> 45:14.000
Well, I must say, I've never seen
a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.

45:14.500 --> 45:16.625
Is all this security really necessary?

45:16.708 --> 45:17.750
[Fry] Oh yes.

45:17.833 --> 45:18.666
Molly.

45:18.750 --> 45:22.083
You see, behind these doors are secrets

45:22.166 --> 45:25.583
that will change
the world of poultry technology forever.

45:25.666 --> 45:26.708
Come on.

45:30.791 --> 45:32.375
[panting] No!

45:33.875 --> 45:35.916
[all grunt]

45:37.083 --> 45:39.166
Oi, what are you lot doing?

45:39.250 --> 45:40.333
[group gasps]

45:41.208 --> 45:43.458
-[whimpering]
-[Bunty grunts]

45:44.916 --> 45:47.458
-[all] Attack!
-[guard groans]

45:47.541 --> 45:49.625
This place is a maze.

45:50.125 --> 45:52.000
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?

45:52.083 --> 45:53.458
[footsteps below]

45:53.541 --> 45:55.208
-There she is.
-[Rocky] Huh?

45:56.958 --> 45:58.125
Molly?

46:00.208 --> 46:02.375
Molly! Molly!

46:02.458 --> 46:04.083
[Molly panting]

46:06.416 --> 46:09.458
[Fry] And, um,
how's the restaurant business?

46:09.541 --> 46:11.166
[Smith] Actually, a little slow.

46:11.250 --> 46:12.541
[Ginger gasps]

46:12.625 --> 46:15.458
[chuckling] Oh well,
I think we can help you with that.

46:15.541 --> 46:17.541
Molly! [yells]

46:17.625 --> 46:18.583
[Fry chuckles]

46:18.666 --> 46:20.208
No! No!

46:22.041 --> 46:24.416
Molly! Molly! Molly!

46:28.208 --> 46:29.291
[Ginger grunts]

46:32.375 --> 46:34.166
Ah. Ginger?

46:35.500 --> 46:37.083
[sighs]

46:37.166 --> 46:38.916
[ominous music playing]

46:39.000 --> 46:41.333
Right. I'm gone.

46:41.416 --> 46:43.125
Well, can't we just take the lift?

46:44.416 --> 46:45.666
[bell dings]

46:45.750 --> 46:48.541
All I can say, Dr. Fry,
is this had better be…

46:50.000 --> 46:51.375
good.

46:51.458 --> 46:52.916
[mysterious music playing]

46:53.000 --> 46:57.541
My, uh, partner
will be joining us shortly.

46:58.083 --> 47:04.166
In the meantime, we've prepared
a little presentation. [chuckles]

47:04.250 --> 47:06.208
Please, be seated.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.416
-[Fry chuckles]
-[control panel whirs, beeps]

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
[whirring]

47:18.916 --> 47:20.500
[lively flute music playing]

47:29.000 --> 47:31.791
[film projector whirring]

47:31.875 --> 47:34.416
[narrator] This is an ordinary chicken.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.875
Plain, dull, and easily frightened.

47:36.958 --> 47:38.333
-[horn honks]
-[panicked clucking]

47:38.416 --> 47:40.458
[narrator] Like any simpleminded creature,

47:40.541 --> 47:42.958
its natural instincts,
when faced with processing,

47:43.041 --> 47:45.041
is fear and panic.

47:45.125 --> 47:46.458
[frantic clucking]

47:46.541 --> 47:48.791
[grinding whir]

47:48.875 --> 47:51.541
[narrator] When this occurs,
the muscles tense,

47:51.625 --> 47:55.125
which cause the connective tissues
to form knots.

47:55.208 --> 47:56.291
[muscle whooshes]

47:56.375 --> 47:57.500
[narrator] The result?

47:57.583 --> 48:01.583
Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.

48:03.083 --> 48:06.041
Mummy, this meat is tough,
dry, and flavorless.

48:06.125 --> 48:08.250
-I hate you, Mummy.
-Oh!

48:09.875 --> 48:10.708
Molly.

48:10.791 --> 48:13.208
[narrator] Fear not,
underappreciated mother.

48:13.291 --> 48:16.208
For what if science could change all that?

48:16.291 --> 48:20.208
For what if science could alter
a chicken's response to fear?

48:20.291 --> 48:21.791
[hen exclaims]

48:21.875 --> 48:22.750
[grunts]

48:22.833 --> 48:26.750
[narrator] What if it could make
a chicken happy to be processed?

48:26.833 --> 48:27.666
[hen exclaims]

48:27.750 --> 48:28.875
[grinding whir]

48:28.958 --> 48:31.708
[narrator] Then you'd say,
"Well done, science."

48:33.208 --> 48:34.291
[Ginger grunts]

48:34.375 --> 48:36.250
[narrator] Because a happy chicken

48:36.833 --> 48:38.458
is a tasty chicken.

48:38.541 --> 48:39.625
[cooker chimes]

48:40.625 --> 48:42.166
[chimes play]

48:46.250 --> 48:49.375
This is the most delicious chicken
in the whole wide world.

48:49.458 --> 48:50.750
I love you, Mummy.

48:50.833 --> 48:52.416
Thank you, science.

48:55.500 --> 48:56.666
[whispering] Molly.

48:56.750 --> 48:57.791
[control panel beeps]

48:58.291 --> 49:01.000
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.

49:01.083 --> 49:02.708
But will you be able to do it?

49:02.791 --> 49:04.791
[woman, echoing] We already have.

49:04.875 --> 49:07.333
-[gasps] That voice.
-[footsteps approaching]

49:13.625 --> 49:14.916
[tense music playing]

49:26.958 --> 49:30.208
Allow me to introduce my wife.

49:30.291 --> 49:31.708
[tense music swells]

49:31.791 --> 49:35.208
[Fry] Melisha Tweedy.

49:37.791 --> 49:41.166
Welcome to the future.

49:41.666 --> 49:44.083
-[Ginger gasps]
-[sinister music playing]

49:45.125 --> 49:46.250
It's her.

49:46.750 --> 49:48.791
[sinister music continues]

49:48.875 --> 49:52.541
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.

49:52.625 --> 49:54.333
The name is Reginald Smith.

49:54.416 --> 49:58.208
Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant chain.

49:58.291 --> 49:59.541
[Fry chuckles nervously]

50:00.291 --> 50:02.041
Hello, Reginald.

50:02.541 --> 50:06.666
I see you've met
my current husband, Dr. Fry.

50:07.500 --> 50:11.666
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

50:12.166 --> 50:15.875
No, it was his mind.

50:15.958 --> 50:20.666
You probably can't tell
by looking at him, but he's a genius.

50:20.750 --> 50:22.375
You flatter me, darling. [chuckles]

50:22.458 --> 50:26.708
With degrees from Oxford
and Cambridge in clinical neurology,

50:26.791 --> 50:30.541
behavioral psychology,
genetic engineering…

50:30.625 --> 50:32.750
And drama!

50:34.708 --> 50:36.583
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]
-[Fry yelps, thuds]

50:37.083 --> 50:39.458
Now you've had the appetizer,

50:39.958 --> 50:42.333
time for the main course.

50:42.833 --> 50:43.666
Come.

50:43.750 --> 50:46.000
[Fry groans]

50:46.958 --> 50:48.791
[energetic music playing]

50:48.875 --> 50:51.291
Molly, no. Get back.

50:51.791 --> 50:54.000
[grunting, muffled] Let me go!

50:54.500 --> 50:56.708
Right. Try and find Molly.

50:56.791 --> 50:59.958
-[control panel beeping]
-Oh, look.

51:00.041 --> 51:02.750
Rocky and the rats are on telly.

51:02.833 --> 51:05.208
Looks like a real cliffhanger.

51:05.791 --> 51:06.958
-[Bunty grunts]
-Where is she?

51:07.041 --> 51:09.041
[ominous music playing]

51:11.750 --> 51:12.750
Oh.

51:12.833 --> 51:14.833
[hens clamoring below]

51:17.833 --> 51:19.208
[Fry] Oh, look.

51:20.166 --> 51:22.666
They like the new egg cup ride.

51:23.291 --> 51:24.791
[chuckles sheepishly]

51:25.791 --> 51:26.791
[Molly gasps]

51:27.708 --> 51:28.541
[quietly] Frizzle.

51:29.791 --> 51:31.375
[gasps] Mum?

51:31.458 --> 51:33.000
Oh, Mollypod.

51:33.083 --> 51:34.291
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

51:34.375 --> 51:36.000
Promise never to run away again.

51:36.083 --> 51:38.458
-Did they hurt you?
-I'm fine, but I think they eat…

51:38.541 --> 51:40.750
-[Mrs. Tweedy] Come on. Get on with it.
-Shh.

51:40.833 --> 51:42.625
[Fry] Right you are, pumpkin.

51:44.833 --> 51:46.708
Behold.

51:46.791 --> 51:50.208
[dramatically] The remote control.

51:50.750 --> 51:55.000
-And the other remote controls.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

51:55.083 --> 51:56.625
Why three?

51:59.750 --> 52:01.833
-Nobody knows.
-[Mrs. Tweedy grunts]

52:02.500 --> 52:04.833
Let's go with…

52:06.500 --> 52:07.541
that one.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.416
-[collars power down]
-[hens] Huh?

52:09.500 --> 52:11.375
-Why am I playing golf?
-Where am I?

52:11.458 --> 52:14.541
-What am I doing?
-Molly? Where are you, Molly?

52:14.625 --> 52:16.333
What's going on?

52:16.416 --> 52:19.083
[splutters] No, no, no.
Wrong one, my angel.

52:19.166 --> 52:21.291
-That's the off button. [chuckles]
-[remote beeps]

52:21.375 --> 52:23.416
-[collars beep]
-[hens] Ah!

52:25.458 --> 52:27.625
Allow me. [chuckles]

52:28.458 --> 52:30.041
[remote chimes]

52:30.916 --> 52:31.750
[beeps]

52:31.833 --> 52:34.041
[collar chimes]

52:34.125 --> 52:37.208
-[gasps] It's me.
-[joyful fanfare playing]

52:37.291 --> 52:39.541
[collared hens] Whoa!

52:39.625 --> 52:41.833
Ah!

52:43.625 --> 52:46.041
-Ooh!
-[escalator whirring]

52:46.625 --> 52:49.208
[hen 1] She's won the prize.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.416
Oh wow.

52:51.500 --> 52:54.166
[all] What a lucky ducky!

52:55.000 --> 52:56.250
[mountain clangs]

53:01.000 --> 53:03.041
[collared hens] Ooh!

53:03.125 --> 53:04.375
[Mrs. Tweedy chuckles]

53:04.458 --> 53:06.333
[quietly] No. Stop.

53:06.416 --> 53:08.708
-[collared chickens]
-[Ginger] Run, chicken! Run!

53:08.791 --> 53:10.333
[collared chickens] Bye!

53:10.416 --> 53:12.166
[hen 2 laughs gleefully]

53:13.833 --> 53:16.833
[collared chickens] Have a nice time!

53:16.916 --> 53:18.250
[fanfare fades]

53:18.333 --> 53:19.625
[grinding whir]

53:19.708 --> 53:22.166
[blades slicing]

53:22.916 --> 53:25.166
Look at me, and do not look away.

53:25.250 --> 53:26.750
[sinister music plays]

53:26.833 --> 53:28.916
[steam hisses]

53:29.000 --> 53:30.125
[cooker chimes]

53:32.458 --> 53:33.750
Behold,

53:34.458 --> 53:37.541
the dawn of the nugget.

53:38.625 --> 53:40.000
[meat sizzling]

53:43.958 --> 53:45.833
Mm! [swallows]

53:46.333 --> 53:48.625
[smacks lips] I love you, Mummy.

53:49.291 --> 53:52.000
Um… Um, I… I… I mean, it's delicious.

53:52.583 --> 53:53.666
Picture it.

53:53.750 --> 53:56.583
-On every street, in every town.
-[Ginger gasps]

53:56.666 --> 53:58.250
People on the go.

53:58.333 --> 54:01.125
Modern people in a modern world.

54:01.208 --> 54:04.041
They want their food,
and they want it fast.

54:04.125 --> 54:08.291
And we will give it to them
by the bucketful.

54:08.875 --> 54:11.750
[moans, inhales sharply]

54:11.833 --> 54:13.625
Fast food.

54:13.708 --> 54:15.708
I like it. This could be big.

54:16.208 --> 54:18.916
No. It will be huge.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.666
And Melisha Tweedy will have her revenge.

54:25.250 --> 54:26.208
[swallows heavily]

54:26.958 --> 54:28.125
Revenge?

54:29.416 --> 54:32.125
Revenue. That's what I meant.

54:32.625 --> 54:36.833
I'll send a truck to collect
the first batch at dawn tomorrow.

54:37.333 --> 54:41.000
With my nuggets
and your chain of restaurants,

54:41.083 --> 54:45.041
this is going to be
a beautiful partnership.

54:45.125 --> 54:46.166
Ah.

54:46.250 --> 54:48.833
[whimsical music playing]

54:48.916 --> 54:52.125
Uh, shall I see you to your car,
Your Sirness?

54:52.875 --> 54:53.833
Come on.

54:53.916 --> 54:55.125
Let's get out of here.

54:55.208 --> 54:57.541
No, wait. We can't go without Frizzle.

54:57.625 --> 55:00.125
Frizzle? Who's Frizzle?

55:00.208 --> 55:02.625
She's my friend. I can't just leave her.

55:02.708 --> 55:03.875
I promised I'd come back.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:41.666
[guard grunts]

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.541
[moans]

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.791
[grunts] Huh?

01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:48.750
Oh!

01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:51.708
-[all straining]
-Come on. We can do it this time.

01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:54.666
I can't hold this much longer.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.500
Fetcher, quickly!

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:59.041
Find a ledge or a crack to grab hold of!

01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:00.083
[Fetcher] Righto.

01:04:00.666 --> 01:04:02.500
Ooh! Not that crack.

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:03.875
[groans]

01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:05.875
-Oh!
-[Babs shrieks]

01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:07.125
[all groan]

01:04:08.666 --> 01:04:11.750
[sighs] Face the facts, duck.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:14.291
We need a miracle to get out of here.

01:04:14.375 --> 01:04:16.833
-[Rocky] Hey! Anyone down there?
-[Ginger gasps]

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.041
-[Molly] Dad!
-[Ginger] Rocky!

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:22.041
[laughs] Do not tell him he's our miracle.
There'll be no living with him.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:24.166
Rocky is on the case.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.500
[group] No! Don't jump!

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.416
-[group shouting]
-What? What's that?

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.208
I can't hear you! Wait. I'm comin' down!

01:04:31.291 --> 01:04:32.458
Don't jump!

01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:33.625
[Rocky yells]

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.708
-Oh! Family hug!
-[Molly gasps, grunts]

01:04:40.791 --> 01:04:42.625
Oh, I missed you guys.

01:04:42.708 --> 01:04:46.541
Okay. Well, let's blow this henhouse
and head home.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.458
[wind billows]

01:04:52.416 --> 01:04:53.375
Ah.

01:04:54.708 --> 01:04:56.291
That's the way out, isn't it?

01:04:57.291 --> 01:04:58.208
[Ginger chuckles]

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.125
I am so sorry.

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.708
[Molly crying]

01:05:02.791 --> 01:05:04.791
[somber orchestral music playing]

01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:10.041
[Molly sobbing]

01:05:10.125 --> 01:05:12.583
Molly, what's wrong?

01:05:12.666 --> 01:05:14.333
This is all my fault.

01:05:14.833 --> 01:05:18.666
I should have listened to you
and done what I was told.

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:20.958
Now everything is a mess.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:29.208
[sighs] Hey, where's my big, brave girl?

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.791
[sighs] That girl's stupid.

01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:34.000
You were right.

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:38.708
If we ever get home, I'll just stay there
and never leave. Ever.

01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:40.916
Hey, no. Molly.

01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:42.791
This is my fault.

01:05:43.291 --> 01:05:48.958
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:52.916
No, this is on me.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.916
I used to hate being fenced in.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:59.083
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.875
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

01:06:04.125 --> 01:06:06.333
What's wrong with being like you?

01:06:11.958 --> 01:06:13.000
Nothing.

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:15.833
-Because your mom is the best.
-[sighs]

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:19.083
And she always has a plan.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.041
Not this time.

01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:23.750
[tense music playing]

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:25.583
[sighs] He's here.

01:06:25.666 --> 01:06:27.541
[Fry murmuring nervously]

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:29.708
-Are we ready to fry, Fry?
-[buttons beeping]

01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:31.375
Five minutes, pumpkin. [chuckles]

01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:33.541
-Make it four.
-[Fry, shakily] Oh.

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:35.250
Where is she?

01:06:35.333 --> 01:06:36.583
-[bell dings]
-Hmm?

01:06:36.666 --> 01:06:41.083
Them runaway chickens, uh,
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

01:06:41.708 --> 01:06:43.708
In the silo, you say?

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:47.166
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:49.416
Production starts in three minutes.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.875
[splutters] Three? [yelps]

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:55.041
Looks like you've just run out of cluck,
little chickens.

01:06:56.833 --> 01:07:00.916
-[machine whirring]
-[menacing orchestral music playing]

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:02.958
[rumbling]

01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:04.208
[family] Huh?

01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.125
[Rocky] Huh?

01:07:05.791 --> 01:07:06.750
Huh?

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:08.166
[Babs whines]

01:07:11.208 --> 01:07:13.666
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:16.625
On the plus side, though,
we will all probably drown

01:07:16.708 --> 01:07:18.666
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:22.333
Popcorn. [chuckles nervously]

01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:25.208
Popcorn, everyone. Look.
Look, popcorn. [laughs]

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:28.250
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to…

01:07:30.625 --> 01:07:31.958
Ah.

01:07:32.041 --> 01:07:33.750
[bright music playing]

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:36.583
The answer to all life's problems.

01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:37.708
Of course.

01:07:37.791 --> 01:07:39.916
Mac, we need heat.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.625
-Lots of it.
-[Mac] Oh.

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:43.833
Will this work? [grunts]

01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:45.708
[grunts] Perfect.

01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:48.541
[grunts] Now, does anyone have a match?

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:51.000
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:53.291
-You'll blow us all to bits.
-[Molly gasps]

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:59.458
Besides, we've used the last one.

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.375
Oh no.

01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:06.333
-[gentle chimes]
-[Rocky gasps]

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:13.375
[gasps] That's my girl.

01:08:13.458 --> 01:08:15.916
[suspenseful music playing]

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.041
Um, can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

01:08:20.625 --> 01:08:21.458
What is it?

01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:23.458
[Rocky and Babs yelp]

01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:25.625
-[both] Huh?
-[rumbling and popping]

01:08:28.958 --> 01:08:30.000
All right.

01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:34.041
Oh!

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:36.666
[alarm blaring]

01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:38.541
Mm. That tastes nice.

01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:39.958
Is there any more?

01:08:40.041 --> 01:08:41.708
[all scream]

01:08:50.833 --> 01:08:52.125
[Fowler] But guess what?

01:08:52.208 --> 01:08:55.916
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.291
enemy fire at six o'clock.

01:08:58.375 --> 01:09:01.791
-[whimsical music playing]
-Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.791
Good old British weather.

01:09:03.875 --> 01:09:04.958
Unpredictable.

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:06.458
You never know what's coming.

01:09:06.958 --> 01:09:08.333
-[groans]
-[Bunty sighs]

01:09:09.083 --> 01:09:11.000
Outrageous.

01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:13.333
[laughs]

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:14.666
[Babs yelps]

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:16.875
[group groans]

01:09:16.958 --> 01:09:17.916
[Ginger sighs]

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.291
[Rocky exhales]

01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:20.750
-[groans]
-[Molly] Hmm?

01:09:20.833 --> 01:09:22.041
[laughing and cheering]

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.125
-Get in there!
-We made it.

01:09:24.208 --> 01:09:25.875
-Look.
-[Fetcher] Whoo-hoo!

01:09:25.958 --> 01:09:29.750
Fowler's only gone
and set up our escape route.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:34.375
-[bright music playing]
-Well done, you old sausage.

01:09:34.458 --> 01:09:36.791
Firm handshake will do, thank you.

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:41.708
[laughs] Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?

01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:43.208
[Babs] Oh yes.

01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:45.416
[group chattering excitedly]

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.666
[Fetcher] Oh, look, Nick.

01:09:47.583 --> 01:09:49.333
Have we got snacks for the way home?

01:09:49.416 --> 01:09:51.333
[bright music fades]

01:09:51.416 --> 01:09:52.875
[wind gusting softly]

01:09:52.958 --> 01:09:54.291
[sighs]

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:58.875
[somber music playing]

01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.708
-[brakes screech]
-[gasps]

01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:05.250
[guard] All right. On you go.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.916
[exhales deeply]

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:10.833
[sighs] Mm.

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.250
Ginger, are you coming?

01:10:17.166 --> 01:10:18.375
No, I'm not.

01:10:20.166 --> 01:10:21.291
I'm going back.

01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:22.958
[Molly gasps]

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:26.333
For Frizzle?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.250
For Frizzle and all the chickens.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.791
-Yes!
-[laughs, sighs]

01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:38.875
[tender instrumental music playing]

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:44.375
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.833
No chicken is an island.

01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:53.291
[Rocky] Hmm.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:55.166
We are with you, Ginger.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.125
Aye, me too.

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:58.583
Me four.

01:10:58.666 --> 01:10:59.708
The rats are in.

01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:02.833
Right. What's the plan, Mum?

01:11:03.708 --> 01:11:08.541
Oh, well, I didn't think you…

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:10.583
Rocky.

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:15.750
Hey, Molly, um,
are you sure you're ready for this?

01:11:15.833 --> 01:11:18.125
-I was hatched ready, Dad.
-[sighs]

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.666
She is a lot like me.

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:23.416
[reversing alarm beeping]

01:11:30.541 --> 01:11:31.750
[engine stops]

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:33.666
-[guard groans]
-Dr. Fry!

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:35.750
What was that noise up on the roof?

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.041
-[guard grunts, thuds]
-Sounded like an explosion.

01:11:38.125 --> 01:11:41.916
[gasps, yelps] Looks like one of the silos
has blown its top.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.458
-[alarm blaring]
-Oh.

01:11:43.541 --> 01:11:45.458
Maybe you shouldn't have put
those chickens

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.500
through the grinder, my love.

01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:49.208
Don't be ridiculous.

01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:51.916
[Smith] Melisha,
all ready for the big day?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.375
[Mrs. Tweedy sighs]

01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:56.333
[cheerfully] Oh yes, Reginald.

01:11:56.416 --> 01:11:58.208
Everything is tickety-boo.

01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:01.041
[Smith] Jolly good.
My truck is ready to go.

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:02.875
We've got to move fast.

01:12:02.958 --> 01:12:05.166
While Tweedy is busy
with her guest outside,

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.250
we sneak back in.

01:12:07.333 --> 01:12:10.916
Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac
to where all the chickens are.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.083
Come on.

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.375
-This way.
-[Babs] Ah.

01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:16.125
[Ginger] Stay out of sight

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:19.666
and get ready to stop
the chickens going up that staircase.

01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:22.833
Rocky, we've got
to get hold of that button.

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:25.208
-[remote beeps]
-[Ginger] And disable those collars.

01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:26.250
[hens murmur]

01:12:26.333 --> 01:12:28.125
[Ginger] As soon as the collars are off,

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:31.083
Molly's team leads the chickens
out of there.

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.208
-We bust our way out.
-[hens clamoring]

01:12:34.791 --> 01:12:36.208
Steal the truck,

01:12:36.291 --> 01:12:37.958
then we're home free.

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:40.208
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:43.375
-All right. Let's do this.
-We're doing it today, are we?

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:46.291
[Fowler] So where was I? Ah, yes.

01:12:46.375 --> 01:12:48.666
Whizzbang Charlie had lost
his undercarriage,

01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:51.458
and the old crate was catching fire…

01:12:51.541 --> 01:12:53.458
[gentle music playing]

01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:57.583
Actually, Melisha,
I have a little something for our big day.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:02.500
[sweetly] Why, Reginald,
this is all very sudden.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.958
