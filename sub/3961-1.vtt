THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO

02:17.871 --> 02:20.840
BASED ON STIEG LARSSON'S NOVEL

02:59.212 --> 03:03.171
Today the verdict was delivered
in the Wennerström case.

03:03.583 --> 03:08.953
The publisher of Millennium
Magazine, Mikael Blomkvist,

03:09.022 --> 03:11.752
has been accused of libel

03:11.958 --> 03:15.917
by successful businessman
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

03:16.029 --> 03:21.023
Blomkvist had accused Wennerström of
gun-running and other serious felonies

03:21.234 --> 03:23.998
amounting to over 60 million kroner.

03:24.070 --> 03:28.029
The Swedes have never agreed
on Mikael Blomkvist.

03:28.241 --> 03:32.041
His supporters claim
he's the last bastion

03:32.245 --> 03:34.975
of a journalism with ideals.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.608
But Blomkvist's long career

03:37.817 --> 03:40.581
as a watchdog may now be over.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.026
In the case of
Wennerström versus Millennium,

03:47.126 --> 03:53.031
the accused Mikael Blomkvist is
found guilty on 6 out of 8 counts.

03:53.633 --> 03:57.535
The accused is sentenced to
three months in jail

03:57.704 --> 04:03.040
and will pay damages of 150,000
kroner to Hans-Erik Wennerström.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.941
You have to stop people
like Kalle Blomkvist

04:13.086 --> 04:19.616
who sniff around in other people's
business due to political differences.

04:20.326 --> 04:23.557
- How will you celebrate?
- No comment.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.061
There he is.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.297
- What's it like to be found guilty?
- Wonderful.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.630
Can you continue
your work as a reporter?

04:35.675 --> 04:39.577
- Cheers, everybody. Merry Christmas.
- Cheers. Merry Christmas.

04:39.746 --> 04:42.715
- Cheers.
- How do we appeal the verdict?

04:43.149 --> 04:46.949
We support you
one hundred per cent, Micke.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.112
But we have to do something.
Our advertisers are losing trust.

04:50.290 --> 04:55.318
- We won't win it back by appealing.
- But it'll buy us some time.

04:55.695 --> 04:59.028
- No appeal. It's over.
- Millennium's future is at stake.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.068
The faster this ends,
the better for Millennium.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.666
I don't want
to play devil's advocate,

05:06.873 --> 05:11.276
but it might be a good idea
if Mikael took leave from Millennium.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.669
Till this thing's blown over.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.116
Merry Christmas.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.224
Wait, Micke.

05:30.129 --> 05:33.826
- They're in shock.
- Only Janne dares to speak the truth.

05:34.033 --> 05:38.163
- I was set up. I'm a problem.
- We just have to find a way.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.134
It's empty in here.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.768
I haven't written a single word
for months now.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.306
Do you understand?

06:37.764 --> 06:41.200
WENNERSTRÖM
KNOCKS OUT BLOMKVIST

06:48.441 --> 06:50.807
GOING TO PRISON

06:57.817 --> 06:59.717
Damn.

07:22.275 --> 07:26.439
We don't normally introduce
the researchers to our clients.

07:26.846 --> 07:31.112
But your client is special to us,
so we'll make an exception.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.219
- It's much appreciated.
- But I must warn you.

07:34.287 --> 07:40.089
- Lisbeth is a pretty odd girl.
- What do you mean by odd?

07:40.259 --> 07:44.025
Make no mistake.
She's the best researcher we have.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.159
Good morning, Lisbeth.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.302
Good morning.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.207
Dirch Frode.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.498
Transcripts of text messages.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.871
E-mails. Bank statements.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.165
How did you get access
to all this?

08:30.343 --> 08:33.312
You order the goods.
I deliver them.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.241
What can you tell me
about Blomkvist?

08:40.352 --> 08:44.380
- It's all in my report.
- The short version.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.251
Blomkvist was nicknamed after fictional
boy detective Kalle Blomkvist

08:49.362 --> 08:52.058
when he foiled
a bank robbery in the eighties.

08:52.265 --> 08:56.827
He's a public figure without any big
secrets. Read all the news clippings.

08:57.970 --> 09:02.430
- But he does have secrets?
- Everyone has secrets.

09:02.875 --> 09:07.335
To what extent is he affected by
the crisis at Millennium?

09:07.547 --> 09:11.347
- Financially, I mean.
- Why don't you just read the report?

09:11.484 --> 09:15.318
Miss Salander,
is there anything you'd like to add?

09:15.388 --> 09:18.551
What's your personal take on him?

09:20.426 --> 09:23.452
There's something fishy
about the Wennerström case.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.923
What do you mean?
There's more to the case?

09:28.134 --> 09:31.001
I'm researching Blomkvist,
not doing his job.

09:31.237 --> 09:35.435
I'd just like to hear
your personal opinion.

09:35.641 --> 09:40.135
Blomkvist's totally clean.
I didn't find anything on him.

09:40.479 --> 09:44.108
I don't think he faked any evidence
against Wennerström.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.251
I think he was set up.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.616
Why didn't you ask me?

09:51.023 --> 09:55.426
- No lawyer could save me.
- I know. I read the verdict.

09:55.628 --> 09:58.495
I didn't want to involve you.

09:58.931 --> 10:03.163
But you could've asked me.
I'm your sister.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.564
- I know.
- I'm glad.

10:05.972 --> 10:09.408
I'm already in the gutter.
Why drag the family down with me?

10:09.542 --> 10:12.636
And you're going to prison.
It's insane.

10:13.045 --> 10:19.382
The secret to good meatballs
is to wet your fingers.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.115
When you roll them,
rub your hands together.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.586
Shit. Will you answer it, please?

10:29.362 --> 10:33.298
- Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- You little rascal.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.435
- This is Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?

10:36.636 --> 10:41.300
- Yes. Who's this?
- My name's Dirch Frode.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.274
I'm a lawyer and I have
a client who'd like to see you.

10:45.444 --> 10:49.437
- It's Christmas. What is it about?
- My client will tell you himself.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.447
Call Millennium after New Year's Eve.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.452
My client doesn't like waiting

10:55.521 --> 10:58.422
- Who's your client?
- Henrik Vanger.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.085
From the Vanger Group?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.558
My client would be very grateful
if you'd come.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.330
Listen, it's Christmas,
and it's been a hell of a week.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.028
I promise
you'll find it interesting.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.254
Blomkvist!

11:43.302 --> 11:48.501
Henrik lives on the island of Hedeby,
a mile or two from Hedestad.

11:57.149 --> 12:01.108
The bridge is the only link
to the mainland.

12:12.798 --> 12:18.259
In the old days, the Swedish
business elite came here.

12:18.471 --> 12:22.237
Now it's just Henrik and his
housekeeper Anna who live here.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.709
Thank you for coming, Mikael.

12:33.452 --> 12:36.717
Frode's call was pretty unusual.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.554
- Are you hungry? It's lunchtime.
- No thanks. Let's get started.

12:42.661 --> 12:46.563
- I'm going back again today.
- Right. No lunch then.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.637
Do you remember her?

12:58.244 --> 13:02.374
It's Harriet Vanger,
my brother Gottfried's daughter.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.549
You've met her.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.481
This girl?

13:09.655 --> 13:14.615
Your father worked for me
during the summer of 1965.

13:14.794 --> 13:19.527
He was a mechanical engineer at
the plant and lived in a cottage here.

13:20.733 --> 13:24.294
You and your mother
came for visits

13:24.370 --> 13:26.395
during the weekends.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.374
Harriet looked after you.

13:29.575 --> 13:33.341
You often played
down there by the water.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.351
I remember her.

13:41.387 --> 13:45.346
- Harriet.
- I never had any children of my own.

13:46.392 --> 13:50.419
Harriet was the apple of my eye.
An incredibly smart girl.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.860
She was like a daughter to me.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.759
What happened to her?

14:01.440 --> 14:05.433
- I believe she was killed.
- Killed?

14:10.783 --> 14:16.244
This is the Vanger family, Mikael.
My family.

14:17.456 --> 14:23.258
September 22nd, 1966. On that day
the family gathered in this house

14:23.429 --> 14:26.296
for the yearly board meeting.

14:26.832 --> 14:30.893
30 small-minded
and greedy people

14:31.770 --> 14:35.399
fighting for
the biggest slice of the cake.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.572
One of these people...

14:41.413 --> 14:43.176
...killed Harriet.

14:45.517 --> 14:49.419
Harriet was 16 years old.
It was Children's Day.

14:50.389 --> 14:55.156
She'd been to Hedestad to
watch the parade in the main street.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.421
This picture
was in the local paper.

14:59.431 --> 15:02.457
She returned to the island
around two o'clock.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.434
She wanted to see me, but...

15:06.505 --> 15:09.372
...I was too busy
with the meeting

15:11.477 --> 15:13.206
How was she killed?

15:15.214 --> 15:19.480
Nobody knows.
She just disappeared.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.288
You're well prepared.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.617
I've been thinking about
that day for 40 years.

15:29.495 --> 15:32.396
That's what I call preparation.

15:33.432 --> 15:39.803
Quarter after two there was a serious
road accident on the bridge.

15:40.005 --> 15:45.466
A fuel tanker full of gas
crashed into a car.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.410
The tanker
was blocking the bridge.

15:48.514 --> 15:52.541
It spilled gasoline
all over the place.

15:52.751 --> 15:57.518
Nobody could pass the tanker.
Everyone had to stay on the island.

15:57.723 --> 16:01.420
By chance,
a photographer caught this.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.519
Look at the window.

16:06.699 --> 16:09.896
This is the last picture
taken of Harriet.

16:11.537 --> 16:16.565
Officer Morell from Hedestad Police
was in charge of the investigation.

16:16.775 --> 16:22.475
He found this film
and had the photo blown up.

16:22.548 --> 16:26.382
Since then nobody has seen her.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.254
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never turned up.

16:35.894 --> 16:38.488
- Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?

16:38.564 --> 16:41.761
- Who's this?
- It's the probation department.

16:41.967 --> 16:45.630
I'm calling to tell you
you've got a new guardian.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.532
I already have one.

16:47.740 --> 16:52.439
Your current guardian
has had a stroke

16:52.578 --> 16:55.547
so I've had to find you
a new one.

16:56.882 --> 17:00.909
I'm glad we could meet
even though it's Christmas.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.752
It's a little unfortunate

17:06.959 --> 17:12.488
that Palmgren had such a relaxed
attitude towards guardianship laws.

17:12.598 --> 17:16.590
I see you were allowed
to control your own finances.

17:16.801 --> 17:21.569
- There haven't been any problems.
- No, maybe not.

17:21.640 --> 17:26.577
But as your guardian, I'm legally
and financially responsible.

17:26.645 --> 17:32.606
So I'm to blame if you suddenly
can't come up with your rent.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.946
I work.
I earn my own money.

17:38.624 --> 17:43.584
Yes, I can see you work for
Milton Security...

17:44.663 --> 17:48.599
- What do you do?
- I make coffee and photocopies.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.335
This is what we'll do:

17:54.540 --> 17:58.601
From now on your pay will be deposited
into a new account that I administer.

17:59.645 --> 18:03.706
Each month you'll get a small amount
for personal necessities,

18:03.949 --> 18:08.716
but all other expenses have to be
approved by me. Okay?

18:14.660 --> 18:18.653
How do you look after
your personal hygiene?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.565
What do you mean?

18:21.600 --> 18:25.661
With all those rings.
Don't you get infections?

18:29.908 --> 18:31.876
Do you have a boyfriend?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.704
No.

18:35.581 --> 18:37.742
Have you ever had sex?

18:38.884 --> 18:40.647
I'm 24.

18:41.653 --> 18:46.647
I can either write down
that you are cooperating,

18:46.758 --> 18:50.558
or that you are causing problems
and being difficult.

18:51.663 --> 18:55.394
And then your life’ll get harder
very quickly.

18:57.102 --> 19:00.037
So how many people
have you had sex with?

19:03.108 --> 19:04.666
- Two.
- Two?

19:07.112 --> 19:09.774
200.
No. 2,000.

19:10.015 --> 19:14.679
- 200,000. Are we done now?
- What kind of sex do you have?

19:16.088 --> 19:18.682
Any special preferences?

19:23.729 --> 19:26.027
What if she simply ran off?

19:26.231 --> 19:30.691
You have to keep the accident in mind.
The bridge was closed for 24 hours.

19:30.903 --> 19:33.599
That's the only way off the island.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.936
So Harriet disappeared
when nobody could leave.

19:37.142 --> 19:42.444
It was only the next day we started
thinking there might be a crime.

19:42.648 --> 19:47.745
But then the bridge was open and the
killer could've disposed of the body.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.820
She could have drowned,
killed herself.

19:51.056 --> 19:56.551
We dragged for her body. We had
tracker dogs and divers everywhere.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.726
Even today,
when I go for a walk,

19:59.798 --> 20:02.733
I catch myself looking for her.

20:05.270 --> 20:09.969
When Harriet was eight,
she gave me a birthday present.

20:10.175 --> 20:13.736
A framed bluebell
from 1958.

20:13.812 --> 20:16.747
After that she gave me
a new flower each year.

20:18.116 --> 20:21.745
1966.
The year Harriet disappeared.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.720
We're going to the attic.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.132
Amazing.

20:45.544 --> 20:49.981
Every damn year, I receive
a framed flower on my birthday

20:50.182 --> 20:52.673
from some far corner
of the world.

20:53.852 --> 20:58.016
- Who do you believe sends them?
- Harriet's killer.

20:59.157 --> 21:03.617
You don't know my family. You don't
know what they're capable of.

21:06.598 --> 21:11.626
Harriet was my favorite. That made her
the ideal victim for those

21:11.803 --> 21:14.795
who wanted more power
in the Vanger Group.

21:17.142 --> 21:19.633
They wanted to crush me.

21:20.846 --> 21:25.044
I'm 82 years old.
The police gave up long ago.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.708
I'll end up going to my grave
without knowing

21:28.854 --> 21:31.823
Help me by giving it one last try.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.120
- Why me?
- I've followed your career.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.161
You're a damn good reporter.
Persistent.

21:38.363 --> 21:42.823
I'm not asking you to solve
the mystery. Just try.

21:43.035 --> 21:46.198
You've six months before
you have to serve your sentence.

21:49.207 --> 21:51.175
You've devoted 40 years to...

21:51.376 --> 21:55.210
I'll pay you handsomely.

21:55.614 --> 21:59.675
You'll be well off.
You've got nothing to lose.

22:00.752 --> 22:03.721
Nothing's waiting for you
in Stockholm.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.931
"Mikael Blomkvist resigns from
Millennium's board

22:16.134 --> 22:18.864
and will no longer
work for the magazine."

22:18.937 --> 22:22.873
Did you write this press release
without talking to me?

22:25.644 --> 22:28.807
Only I could make that decision.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.887
What now?

22:36.655 --> 22:39.624
I'll work for Henrik Vanger.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.759
Henrik Vanger?

22:42.928 --> 22:46.625
I see. So now you're working for
the big capitalists?

22:47.933 --> 22:50.766
It's not for the Vanger Group.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.906
You're gonna stay there?

22:58.443 --> 23:00.240
In Hedestad?

23:08.353 --> 23:10.082
Have a nice trip.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.826
Come on, motherfucker!

24:30.035 --> 24:32.060
What are you looking at?

24:36.007 --> 24:38.999
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing, damn bitch?

24:40.111 --> 24:42.978
That bitch is going down.

24:49.054 --> 24:51.921
- Fucking bitch!
- Get her down!

25:00.065 --> 25:03.762
- The bitch is fucking crazy.
- Come again, you cunts!

25:05.237 --> 25:07.137
Come on.

25:22.287 --> 25:23.948
Shit.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.421
What do you think?

25:29.094 --> 25:31.790
- I can save the hard drive.
- Good.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.933
And the rest?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.941
You have to go shopping

25:47.979 --> 25:51.312
- How did it happen?
- Never mind.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.520
You stink of beer.

25:57.956 --> 26:00.823
You think you smell
like you just took a shower?

26:05.997 --> 26:08.397
You can borrow my old computer.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.866
I'm using it for back-up,
so it has to stay here.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.950
Welcome to Hedeby.

26:36.127 --> 26:40.029
Wonderfully refreshing
with this icy weather.

26:40.165 --> 26:45.034
You didn't want to stay in the main
building. I hope you'll like it here.

26:51.076 --> 26:54.978
If it gets any colder,
the pipes will freeze.

26:55.146 --> 26:58.309
Then you'll have to
come to me for water.

26:58.516 --> 27:02.475
Oh, there you are.
Just leave it there.

27:05.590 --> 27:11.153
It's some of the stuff I've collected
over all these years.

27:12.130 --> 27:16.464
There are photographs.
Police reports.

27:17.502 --> 27:23.168
News articles.
Even some of Harriet's belongings.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.578
Well, it's a start.

28:18.763 --> 28:21.095
You were a beautiful babysitter.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.748
What happened to you?

29:31.569 --> 29:34.163
Keep Sweden pure!

29:34.339 --> 29:37.308
We are the Swedish
National Socialists

29:37.408 --> 29:42.243
and the Aryan race
can't do without us!

29:51.756 --> 29:55.419
All in all, the Vangers are a
pretty unpleasant bunch.

29:55.860 --> 30:00.160
Most of us hate each other,
but are forced together by business.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.326
My brother Harald lives in there.

30:05.436 --> 30:08.633
We don't get along, to put it mildly.

30:11.109 --> 30:15.341
Your brothers Richard and Harald
joined a Nazi group in the 30's.

30:16.381 --> 30:19.544
I see...
You already know about that.

30:20.718 --> 30:23.414
Gottfried was a member of
the Hitler Youth.

30:24.622 --> 30:28.251
All three were Nazis.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.255
Yes. And fanatics, at that.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.098
Richard died in the
Finnish Winter War.

30:39.604 --> 30:44.803
Harald has turned into a bitter,
old man. He never leaves the house.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.213
Harald's daughter Cecilia
is currently in Scotland.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.284
Cecilia and Harald
are not on speaking terms.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.619
Martin lives up there.
Harriet's brother.

31:07.332 --> 31:10.301
He took over
the Vanger Group after me.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.166
Hi.

31:13.371 --> 31:17.398
Well, well. If it isn't the
famous Kalle Blomkvist.

31:17.508 --> 31:20.636
Just call me Mikael.
Then I know who you're talking to.

31:20.845 --> 31:24.178
I'm eager to hear why on earth

31:24.382 --> 31:27.783
you are to spend six months
in this godforsaken place.

31:30.455 --> 31:33.481
Martin's and Harriet's father,
Gottfried,

31:33.691 --> 31:37.252
led a miserable, alcoholic life
with his wife Isabella.

31:38.796 --> 31:43.460
I've never seen a woman be as bad
a mother as Isabella was to Harriet.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.435
I stepped in and took
Harriet and Martin under my wing

31:53.478 --> 31:56.413
And that's all of the Vangers
who live here.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.450
On that day, even more joined us.

31:59.550 --> 32:03.543
Cecilia's sister Anita
who died from cancer.

32:03.788 --> 32:07.952
- Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger.
- Wait a minute.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.224
Who do you suspect?

32:13.364 --> 32:14.626
Nobody.

32:15.566 --> 32:18.763
And everybody. That's where you
come into the picture.

32:56.507 --> 33:01.308
Dear Diary. Today I got this diary
from my dear uncle Henrik.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.777
A kind, but busy, man.

33:03.948 --> 33:08.317
He's finally home from his travels
and brought me this diary.

33:09.554 --> 33:14.651
I'm by myself in my dad's cottage.
Anita will be here soon.

34:13.650 --> 34:16.916
So you're the one
sniffing around in family matters?

34:17.588 --> 34:20.556
Hell, you scared me.

34:21.592 --> 34:25.083
Cecilia Vanger.
Henrik said you'd be here.

34:25.496 --> 34:28.862
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- I recognize you from the papers.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.868
- What have you found?
- Harriet's Bible.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.540
She was often up here
with my sister.

34:37.608 --> 34:39.542
- Anita?
- Yes.

34:39.610 --> 34:42.737
The summer before she disappeared.

34:42.947 --> 34:48.112
- Odd, seeing that her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?

34:49.487 --> 34:53.924
He was drunk and fell into the lake.
They found him the next morning

34:54.125 --> 34:56.592
Just down there.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.966
It happened the year before
Harriet disappeared.

35:04.135 --> 35:06.365
Henrik said you were traveling.

35:06.571 --> 35:09.938
I had to come home
in order to hide Harriet's body.

35:12.543 --> 35:15.944
We weren't allowed to be here
when we were kids. It was off-limits.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.377
Thanks.

35:22.420 --> 35:27.653
Dear Diary. It's fall now.
The weather's getting colder.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.857
Magda 30112.

35:32.697 --> 35:35.564
Sara 32016.

35:36.167 --> 35:39.466
BJ 32027.

35:40.538 --> 35:43.564
U 31208.

35:44.175 --> 35:47.576
Mari 32018.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.875
I don't understand
why Henrik hired you.

35:52.216 --> 35:55.049
To be honest, neither do I.

35:55.453 --> 35:58.980
With all respect,
there's nothing to find.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.420
It's been nearly 40 years.

36:01.626 --> 36:04.652
You found Harriet's diary
in her dad's cottage.

36:04.762 --> 36:10.029
- The diary didn't help us one bit.
- What about the phone numbers?

36:10.234 --> 36:14.034
- They were a complete mystery to us.
- But 32 is...

36:14.238 --> 36:18.106
32 could be Hedestad.
30 is Norrbyn's area code.

36:18.543 --> 36:21.603
But the names
and the numbers don't match.

36:21.712 --> 36:25.671
- Did you call them up?
- We did. We even tried backwards.

36:25.783 --> 36:30.447
We switched them, removed numbers.
We tried everything.

36:30.655 --> 36:35.683
In the report, she's described as
withdrawn and religiously inclined.

36:35.826 --> 36:38.056
Was that your impression?

36:38.262 --> 36:42.062
Who isn't withdrawn at that age?

36:42.266 --> 36:48.227
But, yes. She kept to herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her the best.

36:48.639 --> 36:52.131
Anita is Cecilia Vanger's sister.
And Anita is dead.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.142
She died many years ago.

36:57.181 --> 37:00.014
Harriet was my first case.

37:00.184 --> 37:03.813
I've thought about it
every day for nearly 40 years now.

37:04.755 --> 37:09.021
I'm retiring this summer. It's only
now that I'm able to let it go.

37:10.761 --> 37:13.127
There is no answer.

37:13.531 --> 37:17.729
You'll only breathe life into
Henrik's obsession.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.632
Give it up before you become
obsessed yourself.

38:56.300 --> 38:58.268
What are you working on?

39:26.097 --> 39:30.295
- Who's this week's victim?
- Nobody.

39:36.774 --> 39:40.870
Still that reporter?
I thought you were done with him.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.240
Why do you keep at it?

39:45.883 --> 39:47.874
It's a bit slow.

39:53.023 --> 39:55.184
A new computer?

39:55.359 --> 40:00.888
- Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a 20,000 kroner PC?

40:01.932 --> 40:06.198
- So I can play, surf the internet.
- You often surf the internet?

40:08.305 --> 40:10.102
Do you chat?

40:20.284 --> 40:22.684
Know what, Lisbeth?

40:24.955 --> 40:27.924
I can't just hand you 20,000.

40:29.493 --> 40:32.462
- Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?

40:32.863 --> 40:35.457
Why can't I
look after my own money?

40:37.902 --> 40:40.336
Hit me. Come on.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.002
That's what you want, isn't it?
Hit me.

40:45.042 --> 40:48.944
If you give me any kind of trouble,
I'll make sure

40:49.013 --> 40:52.813
you spend the rest
of your life in a closed ward.

40:52.983 --> 40:57.283
I know all about your mental problems
and your violent background.

41:01.992 --> 41:04.324
Don't get me wrong, Lisbeth...

41:07.298 --> 41:10.199
I'm more than happy
to give you the 20,000.

41:11.936 --> 41:15.929
But, you know,
any business transaction

41:17.942 --> 41:21.469
is built on trust.
I have to feel that I can trust you.

41:23.447 --> 41:25.745
Can I trust you, baby?

41:29.053 --> 41:30.987
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.534
Can I trust you?

42:05.556 --> 42:08.024
If you're nice to me...

42:10.227 --> 42:13.958
If you're nice to me,
I'll always be nice to you.

42:58.008 --> 43:01.500
- It's only 7,000.
- More than enough for a computer.

43:22.433 --> 43:24.401
What are you looking at?

44:02.940 --> 44:07.502
You said it was a photographer
from the paper that shot the parade.

44:07.711 --> 44:11.147
Yes, he covered both the parade
and the accident.

44:11.248 --> 44:14.649
The old part of the archive
is a jumble.

44:15.052 --> 44:21.013
We haven't digitized it.
It's still kept in negative folders.

44:21.191 --> 44:23.921
20... 30...

44:25.195 --> 44:28.255
...40, 50, 60...

44:28.499 --> 44:32.128
A photographer uses
between two and ten rolls a day.

44:32.202 --> 44:35.330
Probably closer to ten
on Children's Day.

44:35.539 --> 44:38.201
Here. September 1966.

44:38.409 --> 44:41.572
I only need the hour
of the parade.

44:41.979 --> 44:45.005
- Knock yourself out.
- They're not sorted?

44:45.182 --> 44:48.674
If you're lucky,
they might be chronological.

44:49.086 --> 44:53.045
You don't happen to have
a negative scanner and a light table?

46:43.834 --> 46:47.292
This is the first lead in the case
in 39 years.

46:47.437 --> 46:49.302
It's a start.

46:52.442 --> 46:54.376
It's more than that.

46:56.313 --> 46:57.678
Look.

46:59.283 --> 47:01.217
You get my drift?

47:02.686 --> 47:06.520
Something catches her eye.
What is it that frightens her?

47:08.225 --> 47:09.749
Her killer.

47:11.361 --> 47:13.761
He was somewhere here.

47:14.198 --> 47:19.659
Harriet's killer is standing
across the street.

47:38.388 --> 47:43.348
- Coffee, Mikael?
- What have you found so far?

47:43.427 --> 47:46.692
I must've read...

47:47.931 --> 47:52.368
...several thousand pages. People
have worked on this for 40 years.

47:53.403 --> 47:57.737
To be perfectly honest,

47:59.509 --> 48:02.410
I haven't found a thing.

48:05.949 --> 48:10.477
Shouldn't you be in Stockholm
trying to appeal your verdict?

48:10.721 --> 48:13.622
- Give it a break.
- You give it a break.

48:14.458 --> 48:18.451
- Mikael's old enough to...
- I was set up.

48:20.430 --> 48:25.390
An old class-mate gave me a tip
concerning Wennerström's company.

48:25.535 --> 48:30.234
It was a good story.
Good enough to nail him.

48:30.407 --> 48:32.307
So you'd think.

48:32.442 --> 48:35.468
Yes, because suddenly there was
an even better story-

48:35.679 --> 48:39.479
about fraud and gun-running
amounting to 60 million kroner.

48:40.751 --> 48:45.415
Wennerström's name was all over it.
So far, so good.

48:46.657 --> 48:51.356
Until I wrote the story.
Then all my sources disappeared.

48:51.461 --> 48:55.522
And all of the documents and evidence
turned out to be forged.

48:55.766 --> 48:57.495
Fake?

48:57.701 --> 49:01.467
So it was an attempt to lure you away
from the real scandal?

49:01.672 --> 49:04.300
It was too good to be true.

49:06.410 --> 49:09.971
Do you want something that really is
too good to be true?

49:15.719 --> 49:19.450
Single malt. 21 years old.

49:21.491 --> 49:25.450
To hell with all the troubles
of the past. Cheers.

49:25.595 --> 49:27.995
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

49:48.518 --> 49:50.679
How about one last glass of wine?

49:56.426 --> 49:58.690
I think I've had more than enough.

50:02.432 --> 50:05.993
- Thanks for a nice evening.
- Is it because of the investigation?

50:06.403 --> 50:08.997
Because of my secretive family?

50:09.406 --> 50:13.536
- What do you mean?
- It could be me. Right?

50:13.744 --> 50:17.510
I guess I'm also
on your list of suspects.

50:42.773 --> 50:45.537
- Bjurman.
- It's Lisbeth.

50:45.675 --> 50:48.644
- What do you want?
- I need more money.

50:50.881 --> 50:53.782
- We'll talk about it.
- I need it now.

51:02.826 --> 51:04.555
Welcome.

51:07.831 --> 51:09.662
Come on in.

51:13.603 --> 51:17.801
- I just want my money.
- You'll get your money.

51:18.008 --> 51:21.569
Thanks for your last visit. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

51:21.711 --> 51:24.976
I won't give you a blowjob
every time I need money.

51:25.382 --> 51:28.909
Is that right?
Then what do you want?

51:30.854 --> 51:34.449
Do you want me to call
the probate department and say

51:34.624 --> 51:38.458
you've trespassed
and you're threatening me?

51:38.862 --> 51:42.889
Then we'll see how quickly
you're back in the psychiatric ward.

51:52.742 --> 51:53.731
So?

52:28.111 --> 52:30.045
That's much better.

52:34.718 --> 52:36.618
Like that.

52:37.721 --> 52:39.188
Come here.

52:41.725 --> 52:43.022
Come on.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.877
No!

54:02.172 --> 54:06.165
I've got... a rule for you to learn.

54:06.576 --> 54:08.942
If you put up a fight...

54:09.145 --> 54:12.876
Are you a good girl?
Are you a good girl now?

58:05.048 --> 58:06.743
NORSJÖ CARPENTERS

58:10.987 --> 58:12.784
NORSJÖ CARPENTERS

58:42.385 --> 58:46.446
My husband died many years ago.
So it's just me left.

58:48.258 --> 58:51.989
He worked there as a carpenter
for 24 years.

58:52.095 --> 58:57.032
They made everything
from clothes pegs to closets.

58:57.100 --> 59:01.059
He built that cabinet.
And the lamp, of course.

59:05.108 --> 59:06.905
More cake?

59:07.076 --> 59:11.570
Do you recall if you were in Hedestad
in September 1966?

59:11.981 --> 59:13.846
Hedestad...

59:14.050 --> 59:16.109
- In '66.
- Yes, in '66.

59:21.958 --> 59:26.588
- Oh, it was our honeymoon.
- Wonderful. Do you have snapshots?

59:26.996 --> 59:30.090
We went camping.
It was all the rage back then.

59:31.501 --> 59:35.130
It was our best holiday together.

59:36.105 --> 59:38.835
But I guess honeymoons
often are.

59:39.042 --> 59:43.411
- But do you have some snapshots?
- I sure do.

59:45.148 --> 59:49.050
Who doesn't save the photos
from their honeymoon?

59:51.654 --> 59:55.112
In the early years,
my husband and I hiked a lot.

59:55.325 --> 01:00:00.285
My husband was a skilled hiker.
We hiked for miles.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:03.624
He wasn't exactly romantic.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.434
Now, let's see.

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:09.872
Hedestad...

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:16.134
Look.
So beautiful.

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:21.080
Even if the photo
doesn't do the sunset justice.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.152
Let's see. Here's something.

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.583
- There was a parade.
- Do you?

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.577
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way out.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:55.542
You've misunderstood the rules.
You have to make an appointment.

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.113
Do you hear me?

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.723
Let me go.

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:40.220
Do you hear me? Let me go.

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:44.058
Do you like being tied up?

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:51.136
Or is your only turn-on
tying other people up?

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:12.256
It's great.

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:16.430
Did you choose it yourself?
You didn't?

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.668
I think it's perfect.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:50.632
You know that show where politicians
get busted by candid cameras?

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.301
We've got those cameras at work.

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:56.497
I had one in my bag
last time I was here.

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:59.140
Welcome.

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:04.313
I just thought you'd make me
give you a blowjob.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.711
But you're sicker
than I imagined.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:12.521
It goes on for two hours. Consider the
reaction of the police and the media.

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.186
Enjoy.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:18.816
Thanks for your last visit. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:22.356
I won't give you a blowjob
every time I need money.

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:26.194
Is that right?
Then what do you want?

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:07.140
I'll tell you how we'll do this.
You just nod.

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:13.277
I'll look after my own account.
You'll have no access.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.749
I control my own finances.

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:22.391
You got that?

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:26.827
Each month you write in your report
that my behavior is perfect.

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.823
Better than ever before.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:35.636
In exactly a year, you'll apply for
the termination of my guardianship.

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:38.272
I'll send you further instructions.

01:04:40.776 --> 01:04:42.835
You can never contact me again.

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:47.909
If you do, I'll send copies of
the video to the police and the press.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:52.287
The same thing happens,
if I'm in an accident

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:54.787
or if you break my rules.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.921
You got that? Good.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:16.277
I've never done this before.
Lie still or it'll get messy.

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.316
Lie still.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:06.892
I'M A SADIST PIG AND A RAPIST

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:40.893
...during the last year...

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:45.427
...an avid interest in religion.

01:07:50.399 --> 01:07:51.957
SEND

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:05.309
The guy in the blue sweater.
I can't get his picture sharp.

01:08:05.548 --> 01:08:08.949
I can't do a thing about it.
It's so out of focus.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:13.620
- Are you sure?
- Positive. I've tried everything.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.622
Okay, thanks for trying

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.640
Wasp...
Harriet's phone numbers.

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:46.077
Book of Leviticus...

01:09:14.015 --> 01:09:16.779
"If a woman
approaches an animal..."

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:20.455
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it,

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.590
kill both the woman and the animal."

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.660
"Their blood
will be on their own heads."

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:28.697
Mari 32018.

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:32.997
Magda 30112.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.627
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, Verse 12.

01:09:36.738 --> 01:09:40.004
"...she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons,

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:43.475
one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:45.703
BJ 32027.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:48.715
"A man or a woman...

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:52.720
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or spiritist among you

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:55.780
must be put to death.
You are to stone them."

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:01.561
Must be put to death.

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:17.109
Frode! What's going on?

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:20.505
It was Henrik.
He just collapsed.

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:24.247
- We'll keep you informed.
- Thanks.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:35.752
It's a heart attack.
He's having emergency surgery.

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:39.124
What are his odds?

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:42.163
They're talking about a bypass
so it's serious.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:48.200
- You want coffee?
- No.

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:57.175
I think you should
go on with your investigation.

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.851
- Have you assigned someone else?
- No, only you.

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:05.493
Someone by the name of Wasp
has hacked into my computer.

01:11:06.328 --> 01:11:11.027
I've received an e-mail with copies
of one of my own documents.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.900
So this person must have
gained access to my hard drive.

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:21.972
Do you know anything about this?

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:28.817
No...

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:32.217
No, but I think I've got
a good idea

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:35.215
who it might be.

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.619
Just stay in bed.

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.121
Lisbeth Salander?

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:14.728
- Who are you?
- You know. May I come in?

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:23.169
I've read your report.
Thrilling stuff.

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:28.104
Particularly that you stole my files.
The police would find that intriguing

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:33.077
They also ought to know that you
are still hacking into my computer.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:44.648
If you remove those papers,
I'll take off the chain.

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:57.801
What do you want?

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.210
- Hi.
- Everything all right?

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:15.990
- What do you want?
- You got any coffee?

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:42.879
How much do you know
about my assignment?

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.815
The 40-year-old murder
of a 16-year-old girl.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:51.826
Until today I wasn't even sure
that she was killed.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:55.158
Then you directed me to
the Biblical references

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:58.060
about women
who should be killed.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:03.000
- And?
- It's the most important clue so far.

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:09.709
- And?
- I need your help.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.211
- I'll pay good money.
- I've already got a job.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:18.818
You work as a professional hacker,

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:22.254
but send me an e-mail
I can easily trace.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.856
Why?

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:35.027
Huh?

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:13.200
So he'll live?

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:20.139
Can I visit him?

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.986
Lisbeth Salander's here.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.291
Okay, Frode.
Talk to you soon. Thanks.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:55.011
If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations...

01:15:57.052 --> 01:16:00.954
As we've been sharing files lately,
I assume you're up to date.

01:16:02.357 --> 01:16:03.949
I am.

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:12.293
You know... What if these quotes
don't have anything to do with God?

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:15.129
What if it's a code?

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:18.966
Sara Witt was found murdered
in her family's barn

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:21.905
outside Vilhelmina in 1962.

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:24.608
Sara? What else does it say?

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:28.472
"Between 2 and 3 am,
the victim was lured..."

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:36.221
"The woman's body was mutilated,
possibly in a religious ritual.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.019
The police won't disclose
any more details."

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:43.425
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Did they find the killer?

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:49.503
No. The case was never solved.

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:56.001
- It's a wild guess.
- I know.

01:16:57.045 --> 01:17:01.311
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- Too far on a motorcycle.

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:23.264
What are we waiting for?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.032
- You want to drive?
- Why?

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:32.209
- I haven't driven since my divorce.
- Then it's about time.

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:56.229
Why do female names
always bring you to porn sites?

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.167
What are you doing?

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:04.071
I'm getting the computer to search
all the newspaper databases.

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:51.122
Let's go to the barn.

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:57.222
They couldn't sell the farm
after what happened.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:19:00.299
It's been empty ever since.

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:06.699
This is where she was found?

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:11.637
Yes. Her husband found her.
It was horrific for him. Horrific.

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:16.140
She was lying right here.

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.184
In this booth.

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:24.586
Bound and tortured.

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:37.098
Were the animals also harmed?

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:40.334
How did you know?

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:46.180
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it,

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.805
kill both the woman and the animal."

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:55.550
- It might be a coincidence.
- Yes.

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:02.560
Goddamn, Lisbeth.
