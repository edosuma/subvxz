WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:02.622
ALL RIGHT,
THEN I COME DOWN HERE.

00:02.623 --> 00:04.053
FAKE. THIS SIDE.

00:04.045 --> 00:07.005
FAKE. THAT SIDE.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.179
OKAY.

00:11.182 --> 00:12.512
SCHOOL'S IN SESSION.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.523
LET'S GET YOU READY
FOR YOUR BIG GAME.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.935
READY? I'VE BEEN READY.
I WAS BORN READY.

00:16.937 --> 00:18.097
WATCH THIS.

00:21.942 --> 00:24.072
WHAT'S ALL THAT JAZZ?

00:24.065 --> 00:27.145
THAT'S TOO MUCH ENERGY
YOU'RE EXPENDING.

00:27.148 --> 00:29.028
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS DRIBBLE TWICE

00:29.029 --> 00:30.649
AND THEN SHOOT.

00:30.651 --> 00:32.701
SET SHOT. SEE THAT?
THAT WORKS.

00:32.703 --> 00:34.873
DAD, THAT'S OLD SCHOOL.
TWO DRIBBLES AND A SHOT

00:34.865 --> 00:37.035
DOESN'T GET YOU
ON "SPORTSCENTER."

00:37.037 --> 00:38.867
NO, BUT IT MAKES IT
ON THE SCOREBOARD.

00:38.869 --> 00:40.869
COME ON,
LET'S PLAY A GAME.

00:40.871 --> 00:43.081
YOU REALLY WANT TO PLAY ME
IN THAT OUTFIT?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.474
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

00:44.465 --> 00:46.875
DAD, LOOK AT YOUR SHIRT.
I CAN SEE YOUR HEART BEATING.

00:46.877 --> 00:48.967
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE SHORTS FROM, KADY?

00:48.969 --> 00:50.469
HA HA HA.

00:50.471 --> 00:53.051
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
THAT BUCKWHEAT JACKSON

00:53.053 --> 00:55.523
WORE A PAIR OF SHORTS
JUST LIKE THIS.

00:55.516 --> 00:57.726
WHO'S BUCKWHEAT JACKSON?

00:57.728 --> 01:00.478
HA! YOU DON'T REMEMBER.
THAT'S OLD SCHOOL.

01:00.481 --> 01:03.101
BACK IN '75, HE PERFECTED
THE OTAY SHOT.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.074
SEE, HE WOULD SHOOT
THE BALL --

01:05.065 --> 01:07.065
KOOM! --
AND THEN THE CROWD,

01:07.067 --> 01:10.107
INSTEAD OF DOING THE WAVE,
THEY'D ALL GO LIKE THIS...

01:10.111 --> 01:13.861
"O...TAY!"

01:13.864 --> 01:15.584
DAD, YOU DON'T WANT
NONE OF THIS,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.906
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
YOUR SAGGY BUTT CHEEKS,

01:17.908 --> 01:20.118
SIT DOWN,
AND WATCH ME GO TO WORK?

01:20.121 --> 01:22.291
JUST PLAY. COME ON.
JUST PLAY A GAME.

01:22.293 --> 01:23.793
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
OTAY.

01:23.794 --> 01:25.214
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT,
BUCKWHEAT.

01:25.206 --> 01:28.206
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

01:28.209 --> 01:31.209
O...TAY!

01:31.212 --> 01:33.052
THAT'S ONE FOR ME,
ZERO FOR YOU.

01:33.053 --> 01:34.393
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK
YOUR PANTIES,

01:34.385 --> 01:36.095
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO TAKE YOU TO THE RACK.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.216
COME ON, JUST STOP
TRASH TALKING

01:38.219 --> 01:40.219
AND LET'S GO PLAY
THIS GAME.

01:40.221 --> 01:42.101
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

01:42.102 --> 01:45.492
THAT'S 2 FOR JUNIOR,
ZERO FOR HUGGY BOY.

01:45.486 --> 01:47.686
SURE YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
JUST PLAY THE GAME.

01:47.688 --> 01:49.688
I'M TELLING YOU,
JUST PLAY THE GAME.

01:49.690 --> 01:51.530
AH, YOU AIN'T GONNA
GET BY -- HEY!

01:51.532 --> 01:52.732
THAT'S CHEATING!

01:52.733 --> 01:54.243
GET THE BALL, OLD MAN!

01:54.235 --> 01:55.495
THAT'S CHEATING.

01:55.496 --> 01:56.946
COME ON.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.330
OH!

02:12.303 --> 02:13.753
MOM, CAN YOU HELP ME?

02:13.754 --> 02:15.354
WHAT'S UP?

02:15.346 --> 02:17.426
WELL, I AM GOING
TO TRINITY'S PARTY TOMORROW,

02:17.428 --> 02:18.928
AND I NEED
SOME UNDERWEAR --

02:18.929 --> 02:20.389
LIKE SOME PANTIES
AND SOME BRAS.

02:20.391 --> 02:23.021
OKAY, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO THE MALL TOMORROW.

02:23.023 --> 02:24.363
GREAT.

02:24.355 --> 02:26.565
HEY, MOM,
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG,

02:26.567 --> 02:29.317
DID YOU EVER NOTICE
THAT THE GUYS WOULD ALWAYS

02:29.320 --> 02:32.030
DANCE WITH THE GIRLS
WHO HAD THE BIGGEST BREASTS?

02:32.032 --> 02:35.202
YEAH, FOR A WHILE,
BUT I FOUND A SOLUTION.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.986
AND WHAT'S THAT?

02:36.987 --> 02:38.987
DANCE
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.

02:38.989 --> 02:40.869
MOM, THAT IS SO GROSS.

02:40.871 --> 02:42.411
GIRLS DO NOT DANCE
WITH GIRLS.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.163
I DANCE
WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.384
THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR
GIRLFRIENDS ARE OLD AND GROSS.

02:46.377 --> 02:48.877
WHAT IS ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT BODY PARTS?

02:48.879 --> 02:51.249
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT
SOMETHING SPECIFIC?

02:51.252 --> 02:53.712
NO, I JUST DON'T WANT
TO HAVE SMALL BREASTS

02:53.714 --> 02:56.014
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
LIKE SOME FREAK.

02:56.006 --> 02:57.346
[ GASPS ]

02:57.348 --> 02:59.388
SORRY, MOM.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.010
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

03:01.011 --> 03:03.011
GUESS WHAT --
I JUST BEAT DAD.

03:03.013 --> 03:05.153
OH, I GOT TO TELL
EVERYBODY I KNOW.

03:05.145 --> 03:06.475
YOU BEAT HIM?

03:06.477 --> 03:08.187
I BEAT HIM
LIKE A DRUM, MOM.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.728
CONGRATULATIONS. YOUR FATHER
USED TO BE THE BOMB

03:10.731 --> 03:12.311
BACK IN THE DAY.

03:12.313 --> 03:14.533
YEAH, HE LET ME IN
ON ALL THAT --

03:14.525 --> 03:16.985
AND BUCKWHEAT AND ALFALFA
AND SPANKY.

03:16.987 --> 03:18.817
HE EVEN TOLD ME
ABOUT SHOWTIME.

03:18.819 --> 03:21.319
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S JUNIOR TIME NOW.

03:21.322 --> 03:23.202
JUNIOR! JUNIOR!

03:23.203 --> 03:25.213
WHERE ARE MY CHEERLEADERS?

03:25.205 --> 03:28.205
All: JUNIOR!
JUNIOR! JUNIOR!

03:28.208 --> 03:30.378
JUNIOR! JUNIOR!

03:30.381 --> 03:31.831
JUN--

03:31.832 --> 03:33.632
MICHAEL! MICHAEL!

03:33.634 --> 03:35.644
MI-- MICHAEL! WHOO!

03:35.636 --> 03:38.216
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?
IT WAS JUST ONE GAME,

03:38.218 --> 03:40.008
AND THAT WAS LUCK.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.930
DON'T FEEL BAD.

03:41.932 --> 03:44.142
I DON'T FEEL BAD
OVER NO STUPID GAME.

03:44.144 --> 03:45.984
IT'S HIS ATTITUDE
I DON'T LIKE.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.016
HE'S ACTING LIKE
A LITTLE THUG OUT THERE,

03:48.018 --> 03:49.938
SHOWBOATING
AND TRASH TALKING.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.270
I'M TRYING TO TEACH THE BOY
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE GAME,

03:53.274 --> 03:56.034
AND ALL HE CAN DO
IS MAKE JOKES ABOUT MY SHORTS.

03:56.026 --> 03:58.236
UM, BABY, THEY ARE
A LITTLE TIGHT.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.658
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:59.660 --> 04:01.280
THEY ARE.
THEY'RE A LITTLE --

04:01.282 --> 04:03.202
I THINK HE GAVE YOU
A WEDGIE, SWEETIE.

04:03.203 --> 04:05.213
YOU KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

04:05.205 --> 04:07.205
IT'S THAT WHOLE
HIP-HOP MENTALITY, YOU KNOW?

04:07.207 --> 04:09.127
THEY THINK
THEY KNOW IT ALL.

04:09.129 --> 04:10.789
YOU CAN'T TELL THEM
NOTHING.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.581
THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO HEROES
LEFT IN THE GAME.

04:12.583 --> 04:14.253
THERE'S NOBODY IN THE NBA

04:14.254 --> 04:16.474
WHO YOU WANT TO SEE
ON A BOX OF CEREAL.

04:16.466 --> 04:18.087
ALLEN IVERSON?
GOOD PLAYER,

04:18.088 --> 04:20.257
BUT YOU GOT CORNROWS
IN YOUR CORN FLAKES.

04:22.142 --> 04:23.682
LATRELL SPREWELL --

04:23.684 --> 04:26.694
HE ON THE BOX
CHOKING HIS COACH.

04:26.687 --> 04:28.977
PATRICK EWING --
WHAT ABOUT PATRICK EWING?

04:28.979 --> 04:30.389
OH, YEAH.

04:30.391 --> 04:32.481
TRY EATING YOUR WHEATIES
LOOKING AT THIS.

04:32.483 --> 04:34.103
YOU SAW THE MILK AD.

04:34.104 --> 04:36.114
HE GOT MILK,
AND I GOT SICK

04:36.106 --> 04:37.656
WATCHING HIM GET MILK.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.401
YOU KNOW
WHAT REALLY GOT TO ME?

04:42.403 --> 04:44.373
IS JUNIOR
TRYING TO INSINUATE

04:44.365 --> 04:46.865
THAT I LOST A STEP,
LIKE I'M GETTING OLD.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.407
I'M JUST AS QUICK
AS I WAS IN COLLEGE.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.460
MICHAEL, I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE

04:51.462 --> 04:53.412
THAT A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED
SINCE COLLEGE, BABY.

04:53.414 --> 04:56.684
GEE, DAD, ARE YOU OTAY?

04:56.677 --> 04:58.337
HA HA HA HA.

04:58.339 --> 05:00.259
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THAT.

05:00.260 --> 05:02.510
ALL RIGHT...GYM TEACHER.

05:02.513 --> 05:03.923
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:03.924 --> 05:05.934
OUT ON THE COURT,
YOU CAN TALK TRASH,

05:05.926 --> 05:08.346
BUT IN THIS HOUSE,
YOU TAKE OUT TRASH.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.519
AND THEN GO CLEAN
YOUR ROOM.

05:10.521 --> 05:11.731
WHAT?

05:11.732 --> 05:13.312
YOU HEARD ME.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.903
YOU'RE GOING TO QUESTION
MY AUTHORITY,

05:14.895 --> 05:16.485
WASH ALL THE WINDOWS
AROUND THE HOUSE.

05:16.487 --> 05:18.937
YEAH, WELL, I STILL
BEAT YOU, OLD MAN.

05:18.939 --> 05:20.529
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:20.531 --> 05:22.941
I WANT YOU
TO CUT THE GRASS

05:22.943 --> 05:25.753
WITH SCISSORS,
ONE BLADE AT A TIME.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.756
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR BREAKFAST?

05:38.759 --> 05:41.879
AN ADVIL OMELET
AND A SIDE OF BEN-GAY.

05:41.882 --> 05:43.342
I'M SO SORE,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.393
I CAN'T EVEN LIFT
MY ARMS UP.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.346
THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU SPENT ALL YESTERDAY

05:47.347 --> 05:48.967
PLAYING BASKETBALL
WITH JUNIOR.

05:48.969 --> 05:50.969
BUT I USED TO PLAY
ALL THE TIME.

05:50.971 --> 05:52.771
I NEVER GOT SORE.
I WAS A GYM RAT.

05:52.773 --> 05:54.063
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:54.064 --> 05:56.074
BABY, YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO FACE THE FACT

05:56.066 --> 05:57.976
THAT YOU'RE GETTING
A LITTLE OLDER.

05:57.978 --> 05:59.438
LIFE IS DIFFERENT NOW.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.860
I'M NOT GETTING OLDER.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.901
ALL I NEED TO DO
IS SOME CONDITIONING,

06:02.903 --> 06:05.583
GET BACK IN SHAPE...
AND STAY AWAY FROM YOU.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.746
ME? WHAT DID I DO?

06:07.748 --> 06:09.368
YOU KEEP ME IN THE BED

06:09.369 --> 06:12.039
AND ROB ME OF MY NATURAL
MANLY NITROGLYCERIN.

06:12.042 --> 06:14.502
YEAH, WELL, I STILL SAY
YOU'RE A SORE LOSER.

06:14.495 --> 06:16.835
YEAH? WELL, NO NITRO
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.758
FINISH YOUR ROOM?
YES, SIR!

06:20.761 --> 06:23.841
FINISH WASHING ALL THE WINDOWS
AROUND THE HOUSE?
YES, SIR!

06:23.844 --> 06:24.974
IS HE MESSING WITH ME?

06:24.965 --> 06:26.805
YES, SIR!

06:26.807 --> 06:30.967
OKAY, SO NOW I WANT YOU
TO, UM...

06:30.971 --> 06:33.891
VACUUM UP
THAT WOOD OUT THERE.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.404
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.186
I'M DONE.

06:38.188 --> 06:40.438
NO, YOU'RE DONE
WHEN I SAY YOU'RE DONE.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.231
NO, YOU'RE PUNISHING ME
FOR BEATING YOU,

06:42.232 --> 06:44.192
AND IT'S NOT RIGHT.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

06:44.194 --> 06:45.794
OH, REALLY? AND WHERE
YOU GOING TO BE STAYING

06:45.786 --> 06:48.286
WHILE YOU'RE NOT DOING IT?
WHAT'S THE NEW ADDRESS?

06:48.288 --> 06:50.158
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.830
OH, YOU A MAN NOW?

06:51.832 --> 06:53.872
YOU GOT THREE HAIRS
IN YOUR DRAWERS,

06:53.874 --> 06:56.344
AND YOU THINK
YOU'RE TOUGH?

06:56.336 --> 06:58.586
I'M MAN ENOUGH TO BEAT YOU
ONE-ON-ONE.

06:58.589 --> 07:00.589
YOU BETTER BE TALKING
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

07:00.591 --> 07:02.501
MAYBE I AM,
MAYBE I'M NOT.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.253
WHY DON'T YOU PICK WHICH
DIRECTION YOU WANT TO FALL?

07:04.254 --> 07:05.974
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT TO KNOCK YOU
ON YOUR LITTLE BEHIND.

07:05.966 --> 07:07.636
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA!

07:07.638 --> 07:09.638
THERE WILL BE
NO FIGHTING IN THIS HOUSE!

07:09.640 --> 07:11.640
THAT'S NOT HOW WE SETTLE
ARGUMENTS AROUND HERE.

07:11.642 --> 07:13.222
NOW, Y'ALL WANT
TO WORK THIS OUT,

07:13.223 --> 07:15.233
WORK IT OUT ON THE COURT,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT STARTED.

07:15.225 --> 07:16.935
THAT'S WHERE
IT'S GOING TO END.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.767
FINE.
LET THE COURTS DECIDE.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.400
I DON'T CARE WHAT COURT --
BASKETBALL COURT,

07:21.401 --> 07:23.441
TENNIS COURT,
SUPREME COURT --

07:23.443 --> 07:25.873
NEVER MIND.
WE WANT A DECISION.

07:25.866 --> 07:27.486
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

07:27.488 --> 07:29.488
NO, LET'S MAKE IT
INTERESTING.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.620
LET'S PLAY FOR SOMETHING
THIS TIME.

07:31.622 --> 07:32.952
YOU NAME IT.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.963
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL PLAY
FOR MY CHORES.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.205
IF I WIN, YOU DO THEM.
IF YOU WIN, I DO THEM,

07:37.207 --> 07:39.207
AND I DON'T COMPLAIN
FOR ONE YEAR.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.839
HA. IT'S GOING TO BE
REAL QUIET AROUND THIS HOUSE.

07:41.842 --> 07:43.582
IT'S ON.

07:43.584 --> 07:46.894
WELL, I'LL MEET YOU
OUT THERE...OLD MAN.

07:46.887 --> 07:50.797
SEE, THAT "OLD MAN" THING
AIN'T WORKING FOR ME.

08:06.316 --> 08:08.486
MICHAEL, I NEED YOU.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.411
OH, DAD.
HUH?

08:13.413 --> 08:15.423
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

08:15.415 --> 08:17.245
WHERE?

08:17.247 --> 08:19.327
GOT IT.

08:22.963 --> 08:26.633
DID HE REALLY BEAT YOU
15-ZIP?

08:26.627 --> 08:29.087
NO.
IT WAS 15 TO 2 1/2.

08:29.089 --> 08:32.969
BALL WENT IN AND CAME OUT
FIVE TIMES --

08:32.972 --> 08:34.982
THAT'S A HALF POINT.

08:34.975 --> 08:36.934
LOOK, THAT IS NOT
WHY I CALLED YOU.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.687
I FORGOT THAT I HAD
TO TAKE KADY

08:38.688 --> 08:40.099
TO TUMBLE TOTS TODAY.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.900
SHE'S LEARNING HOW
TO ROLL BACKWARDS

08:41.902 --> 08:43.732
AND I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO MISS IT.

08:43.734 --> 08:46.534
OHH. ROLLING BACKWARDS IS
A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.776
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU'RE ROLLING BACKWARDS,

08:48.779 --> 08:51.149
DO ME A FAVOR --
DON'T EMBARRASS YOUR MOMMY

08:51.151 --> 08:53.321

AND I CAN FLOAT
ABOVE THE RIM.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.661
BUT WHEN I TRY TO DO IT,
I'M MICHAEL BOLTON

20:03.663 --> 20:05.713
AND I CAN'T EVEN
GET OFF THE GROUND.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.285
I LET MY EGO GET IN THE WAY.
I FEEL STUPID.

20:08.288 --> 20:10.998
I'M TRYING TO COMPETE
AGAINST MY OWN SON.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.290
THAT'S JUST NOT A FIGHT
I'M GOING TO WIN.

20:13.293 --> 20:14.833
TIME IS ON HIS SIDE.

20:14.834 --> 20:17.434
HEY, MICHAEL, DO YOU HAVE
ANY ENERGY LEFT?

20:17.427 --> 20:18.717
FOR WHAT?

20:18.718 --> 20:22.598
WHOA!

20:22.602 --> 20:25.222
ANNA NICOLE JAY. HELLO.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.564
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEW LOOK?

20:27.557 --> 20:30.147
WELL, THE TRUTH IS I LOVE YOU
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

20:30.149 --> 20:34.059
OH, BABY, YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE THESE OFF?

20:34.063 --> 20:36.033
MM-HMM. AS SOON
AS WE'RE FINISHED.

20:36.025 --> 20:37.945
HA HA HA.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.455
AAH!

20:47.457 --> 20:49.457
THAT WAS
UNCALLED FOR!
