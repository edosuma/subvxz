WEBVTT

00:06.320 --> 00:07.799
It's fine.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.071
Everything's fine.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.355
Nothing's wrong. It's all fine.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.749
Excuse me, what day is it?

00:15.840 --> 00:19.116
- Saturday.
- Saturday. Good.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.792
Good. I like Saturdays.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.395
- So I just met Rose Tyler?
- Yeah.

00:24.480 --> 00:26.596
But she's locked away
in a parallel world.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.831
Exactly. If she can cross from her
parallel world to your parallel world

00:29.920 --> 00:32.308
then that means the walls of
the universe are breaking down,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.437
which puts everything in danger.
Everything.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.192
But how?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:08.760 --> 01:11.797
Thing is, Doctor,
no matter what's happening,

01:11.880 --> 01:14.314
and I'm sure it's bad, I get that.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.280
But Rose is coming back.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.717
Isn't that good?

01:23.160 --> 01:24.229
Yeah.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.749
- What the hell was that?
- Don't know. It came from outside.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.031
But we're in space.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.997
How did it happen?

01:41.080 --> 01:43.196
What did you do?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.355
We haven't moved. We're fixed.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.077
It can't have. No!

01:53.640 --> 01:57.189
Tardis is still in the same place,
but the Earth has gone.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.512
The entire planet!

02:00.560 --> 02:02.118
It's gone.

02:07.400 --> 02:12.030
Give me a cigarette. Right now.
Confirm all stations still online.

02:12.120 --> 02:14.998
Can anyone hear me?
Have we got contact with UNIT base...

02:15.080 --> 02:18.390
- What was that?
Emergency systems online.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.072
Was it some sort of earthquake or...

02:20.160 --> 02:22.116
Get the system operational...

02:22.200 --> 02:25.590
- Jalandra, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.477
Is anyone hurt?

02:27.560 --> 02:29.437
We've lost power.
Someone get the lights back on.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.715
DaCosta, see to it right now.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.314
Suzanne, are you okay?

02:35.240 --> 02:38.710
- Martha, look at the sky.
- Why, what is it?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.950
Just look at the sky!

02:41.840 --> 02:44.832
Whoa, what happened?

02:44.920 --> 02:48.469
Is it the rift? Gwen, lanto, you okay?

02:48.560 --> 02:51.791
No broken bones. Slight loss of dignity.
No change there, then.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.952
The whole of the city must've felt that.
The whole of South Wales.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.156
I'm gonna take a look outside.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.510
A little bit bigger than South Wales.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.233
Luke, are you all right?

03:13.400 --> 03:16.836
It felt like some sort of
cross-dimensional spatial transference.

03:16.920 --> 03:20.469
But it's night. It wasn't night.
It was 8:00 in the morning!

03:20.560 --> 03:22.118
Mr Smith, I need you!

03:25.080 --> 03:27.992
I wish you'd stop giving that fanfare
and just tell me what happened!

03:28.080 --> 03:30.958
<i>Sarah Jane, I think
you should look outside.</i>

03:31.040 --> 03:34.316
<i>I'll think you'll find
the visual evidence most conclusive.</i>

03:35.080 --> 03:39.631
It's gone dark.
It's them aliens, I'll bet my pension.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.109
What do you want this time,
you green swine?

03:42.200 --> 03:45.272
- Dad...
- Look, you get back inside, Sylvia.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.239
- They always want the women.
- No, Dad, just look. Oh, my God!

03:49.880 --> 03:51.552
Look at the sky!

03:54.240 --> 03:55.719
That's impossible.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.399
That's just impossible.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.078
It can't be.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.837
Right, now we're in trouble.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.954
And it's only just beginning.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.991
But if the Earth's been moved,
they've lost the Sun.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.197
What about my mum? And Granddad?

05:20.280 --> 05:21.759
They're dead!

05:22.800 --> 05:24.233
Are they dead?

05:24.320 --> 05:28.313
I don't know, Donna. I just don't know.
I'm sorry, I don't know.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.756
That's my family. My whole world.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.308
There's no readings. Nothing.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.356
Not a trace.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.830
Not even a whisper.
Oh, that is fearsome technology.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.832
- So what do we do?
- We've got to get help.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.319
From where?

05:46.120 --> 05:49.669
Donna, I'm taking you
to the Shadow Proclamation.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.713
Hold tight.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.755
<i>The United Nations have issued an edict</i>

06:00.840 --> 06:04.594
<i>asking the citizens of the world
not to panic.</i>

06:04.680 --> 06:08.468
<i>So far there has been
no explanation of the 26 planets</i>

06:08.560 --> 06:10.437
<i>which have appeared in the sky.</i>

06:10.880 --> 06:12.871
<i>But it's an empirical fact.</i>

06:12.960 --> 06:15.520
<i>The planets didn't come to us,
we came to them.</i>

06:15.680 --> 06:17.272
<i>Just look at the stars.</i>

06:17.360 --> 06:21.558
<i>We're in a completely different
region of space. We've travelled.</i>

06:21.840 --> 06:24.638
<i>Do you know what? I look up and
there's all these moons and things...</i>

06:24.720 --> 06:27.393
<i>Have you seen them? Do you see them?</i>

06:27.480 --> 06:30.711
<i>What was I drinking last night?
Furniture polish?</i>

06:32.200 --> 06:34.430
lanto. Time and a place.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.239
- Yeah, it's funny, though.
- Gwen, come and see.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.914
Rhys, I have no idea. Just stay indoors.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.389
Can you phone my mother? Tell her...

06:42.480 --> 06:46.439
Oh, I don't know. Just tell her
to take her pills and go to sleep.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.316
I'm gonna come home as soon as I can.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.992
I promise.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.029
I love you, you big idiot.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.714
Someone's established
an artificial atmospheric shell,

06:56.800 --> 06:58.472
keeping the air and holding in the heat.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.869
Whoever's done this
wants the human race alive.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.757
That's a plus.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.673
Twenty-seven planets,
including the Earth.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.432
No, but what's that?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.439
That's not a planet!

07:12.120 --> 07:14.759
<i>The reading seems to be
artificial in construction.</i>

07:14.840 --> 07:18.230
Some sort of space station,
sitting at the heart of the web.

07:18.320 --> 07:20.629
They're fine. Maria and her dad,
they're still in Cornwall.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.598
I told them to stay indoors.
Clyde's all right, he's with his mum.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.514
<i>Sarah Jane,
I have detected movement. Observe.</i>

07:28.160 --> 07:29.718
Spaceships.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.229
Tracking 200 objects.
Earthbound trajectory.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.470
Geneva is calling a Code Red.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.796
Everyone to battle positions.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.758
Dr Jones, if you're not too busy...

07:42.840 --> 07:45.354
- I'm trying to phone the Doctor, sir.
- And?

07:45.440 --> 07:48.750
There's no signal. This number
calls anywhere in the universe.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.116
It never breaks down.
They must be blocking it.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.679
Whoever they are.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.389
We're about to find out.
They're coming into orbit.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.072
I'll take you on! Yeah, you, mate!

08:19.720 --> 08:21.551
The end of the world, darling.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.756
End of the stinking world.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.070
Have one on me, mate.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.871
Right. You two, you can put
that stuff down or run for your lives.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.471
Do you like my gun?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.834
<i>We're now getting confirmed reports
of spaceships.</i>

08:53.920 --> 08:56.309
<i>The Pentagon has issued
an emergency report.</i>

08:56.480 --> 08:58.755
Dad, come and see.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.590
They're saying spaceships.

09:01.680 --> 09:03.557
- Did you find her?
- No.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.437
No, there's no reply.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.838
Where are you, Donna?

09:07.920 --> 09:10.593
<i>...and stay indoors.
- Where are you, sweetheart?</i>

09:11.920 --> 09:15.276
3,000 miles and closing.
But who are they?

09:18.320 --> 09:21.710
Martha Jones, voice of a nightingale.
Tell me you put something in my drink.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.115
No such luck. Have you heard
from the Doctor?

09:24.200 --> 09:26.589
<i>- Not a word. Where are you?
- New York.</i>

09:26.680 --> 09:29.240
- Oh. Nice for some.
- I've been promoted.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.311
Medical Director on Project Indigo.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.834
Did you get that thing working?

09:33.920 --> 09:36.878
Indigo's top secret.
No one's supposed to know about it.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.315
I met a soldier in a bar. Long story.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.958
- When was that?
- Strictly professional.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.874
1,500 miles, boys.
And accelerating. They're almost here.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.637
<i>I'm receiving a communication
from the Earthbound ships.</i>

09:48.720 --> 09:50.756
<i>They have a message for the human race.</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:52.592
Put it through. Let's hear it.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.436
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

09:56.920 --> 09:58.592
<i>Exterminate!</i>

09:59.120 --> 10:00.599
<i>Exterminate!</i>

10:01.200 --> 10:02.792
<i>Exterminate!</i>

10:02.880 --> 10:04.598
<i>- Exterminate!
- No.</i>

10:04.680 --> 10:06.159
<i>Exterminate!</i>

10:06.600 --> 10:08.192
<i>Exterminate!</i>

10:08.280 --> 10:09.679
<i>- Oh, no.
- Exterminate!</i>

10:09.760 --> 10:12.354
What is it? Who are they?
Do you know them, Jack?

10:12.440 --> 10:16.228
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

10:16.880 --> 10:18.438
<i>Exterminate!</i>

10:18.720 --> 10:20.517
<i>Exterminate!</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:23.036
<i>- No.
- Exterminate!</i>

10:23.120 --> 10:26.351
<i>- There's nothing I can do.
- Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

10:26.440 --> 10:29.352
<i>- I'm sorry. We're dead.
- Exterminate!</i>

10:29.440 --> 10:32.671
<i>- Exterminate!
- Oh, God, you're so young.</i>

10:32.760 --> 10:35.991
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

10:36.320 --> 10:39.710
<i>Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

10:39.800 --> 10:42.598
- Get out of here! Come on!
- This way. Come on!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.673
<i>Dalek fleet in battle formation.</i>

11:11.440 --> 11:14.159
<i>All systems locked and primed.</i>

11:14.360 --> 11:17.113
<i>Crucible at 90% efficiency.</i>

11:17.200 --> 11:19.668
<i>The human harvest will commence.</i>

11:21.840 --> 11:23.273
Battle stations!

11:23.360 --> 11:25.715
Geneva declaring ultimate Code Red.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.834
Ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.313
<i>Supreme Dalek on the bridge.</i>

11:53.080 --> 11:56.709
<i>Soon the crucible will be complete.</i>

11:56.800 --> 12:00.918
<i>We have waited long
for this ultimate destiny.</i>

12:01.000 --> 12:04.959
<i>Now the Daleks are the masters of Earth.</i>

12:05.920 --> 12:12.079
<i>Daleks are the masters of Earth!</i>

12:15.880 --> 12:19.714
So, go on, then.
What is the Shadow Proclamation anyway?

12:19.800 --> 12:23.429
Posh name for police.
Outer-space police. Here we go!

12:42.240 --> 12:45.596
Sco bo tro no flo jo ko fo to do.

12:46.080 --> 12:49.152
No bo ho sho ko ro to so.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.992
Bo-ko-do-zo-go-bo-fo-po-jo.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.588
Mo ho.

12:56.680 --> 12:59.513
Time Lords are the stuff of legend.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.319
Belong in the myths and whispers
of the higher species.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.392
You cannot possibly exist.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.313
Yeah. More to the point,
I've got a missing planet.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.153
Then you're not as wise
as the stories would say.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.071
The picture is far bigger
than you imagine.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.038
The whole universe is
in outrage, Doctor.

13:16.120 --> 13:20.193
Twenty-four worlds
have been taken from the sky.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.713
How many?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.677
Which ones? Show me!

13:25.400 --> 13:27.436
Locations range far and wide.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.478
They all disappeared at the exact
same moment, leaving no trace.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.394
Callufrax Minor. Jahoo. Shallacatop.
Woman Wept.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.111
Clom! Clom's gone! Who'd want Clom?

13:37.200 --> 13:39.316
All different sizes.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.517
Some populated, some not.
But all unconnected.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.076
- What about Pyrovillia?
- Who is the female?

13:46.160 --> 13:50.278
Donna. I'm a human being.
Maybe not the stuff of legend,

13:50.360 --> 13:53.352
but every bit as important
as Time Lords, thank you.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.433
Way back, when we were in Pompeii,
Lucius said Pyrovillia had gone missing.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.592
Pyrovillia is cold case. Not relevant.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.193
How do you mean, cold case?

14:02.280 --> 14:04.635
The planet Pyrovillia
cannot be part of this.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.712
- It disappeared over 2,000 years ago.
- Yes, yes, hang on.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.155
But there's
the Adipose Breeding Planet, too.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.552
Miss Foster said that was lost.
But that must have been a long time ago.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.108
That's it! Donna, brilliant!

14:17.200 --> 14:20.272
Planets have been taken
out of time as well as space.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.112
Put this into 3D.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.430
Now, if we add Pyrovillia

14:28.800 --> 14:30.518
and Adipose III.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.310
Something missing.
Where else, where else, where else?

14:35.400 --> 14:38.676
Lost, lost, lost, lost.
Oh! The lost moon of Poosh!

14:46.280 --> 14:48.635
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

14:49.480 --> 14:53.234
The planets rearranged themselves
into the optimum pattern. Ooh.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.398
Look at that.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.949
Twenty-seven planets in perfect balance.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.519
Come on, that is gorgeous.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.398
Oi, don't get all spaceman.
What does it mean?

15:03.480 --> 15:06.995
All those worlds fit together
like pieces of an engine.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.356
It's like a powerhouse.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.116
- What for?
- Who could design such a thing?

15:13.200 --> 15:16.112
Someone tried to move the Earth
once before.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.392
Long time ago.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.798
It can't be.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.558
<i>Maximum extermination!</i>

15:28.400 --> 15:31.073
<i>The shields are down!
There's too many of them! Abandon ship!</i>

15:31.160 --> 15:32.354
<i>The Valiant's down!</i>

15:32.440 --> 15:35.398
Air force retreating over North Africa.
Daleks landing in Japan.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.436
We've lost contact
with the Prime Minister's plane.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.432
- Jack! Manhattan!
- Martha, get out of there.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.351
I can't, Jack. I've got a job to do.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.238
They're targeting military bases,
and you're next on the list.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.993
Dr Jones, you will come with me.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.117
Project Indigo is being activated.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.713
Quick march.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.876
But we can't use Project Indigo.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.872
It hasn't been tested, sir.
We don't even know if it works.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.517
<i>Human forces will be exterminated!</i>

16:04.600 --> 16:06.909
<i>Annihilate UNIT!</i>

16:13.320 --> 16:16.073
<i>Exterminate!</i>

16:23.240 --> 16:25.754
Put it on. Fast as you can!

16:27.280 --> 16:31.034
Martha, I'm telling you.
Don't use Project Indigo. It's not safe!

16:31.120 --> 16:34.237
You take your orders from UNIT,
Dr Jones, not from Torchwood.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.197
- But why me?
- You're our only hope

16:36.280 --> 16:40.637
of finding the Doctor.
But failing that, if no help is coming,

16:40.720 --> 16:44.713
then with the power invested in me
by the Unified Intelligence Taskforce

16:44.800 --> 16:47.030
I authorise you to take this.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.837
The Osterhagen Key.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.593
I can't take that, sir.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.477
You know what to do!

16:54.560 --> 16:57.028
For the sake of the human race.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.510
<i>Dalek Attack Squad Five
reaching north corridor.</i>

17:03.600 --> 17:05.750
<i>- Dr Jones.
- Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

17:05.839 --> 17:07.637
<i>- Good luck.
- Exterminate!</i>

17:14.880 --> 17:16.393
<i>Exterminate!</i>

17:16.480 --> 17:18.596
- Bye, Jack.
- Martha, don't do it!

17:21.800 --> 17:22.949
Don't!

17:26.040 --> 17:27.712
What's Project Indigo?

17:27.800 --> 17:29.631
<i>UNITbase...</i>

17:29.720 --> 17:33.315
Experimental teleport
salvaged from the Sontarans.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.960
But they haven't got coordinates
or stabilisation!

17:36.040 --> 17:38.110
So where is she?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.031
Scattered into atoms.

17:41.600 --> 17:42.919
Martha's down.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.271
<i>Commence the landings.</i>

17:46.360 --> 17:48.555
<i>Bring the humans here.</i>

17:48.640 --> 17:50.756
<i>Prepare the crucible.</i>

17:50.840 --> 17:53.673
<i>Supreme Dalek, is there news?</i>

17:53.760 --> 17:56.354
<i>Earth has been subjugated.</i>

17:57.160 --> 18:00.550
<i>I mean, is there news of him?</i>

18:00.840 --> 18:04.674
<i>Negative. No reports of Time Lord.</i>

18:04.760 --> 18:07.558
<i>We are beyond the Doctor's reach.</i>

18:07.640 --> 18:09.153
<i>Fascinating.</i>

18:09.240 --> 18:13.199
<i>If I had not elevated you
beyond crude emotions,</i>

18:13.280 --> 18:16.989
<i>I could almost mistake that tone
for one of victory.</i>

18:17.560 --> 18:19.471
<i>Beware your pride.</i>

18:19.560 --> 18:22.120
<i>The Doctor cannot stop us.</i>

18:22.200 --> 18:26.193
<i>And yet Dalek Caan is uneasy.</i>

18:29.360 --> 18:32.272
<i>The abomination is insane!</i>

18:32.360 --> 18:37.514
<i>Show respect. Without Dalek Caan
none of this would be possible.</i>

18:37.600 --> 18:39.750
<i>And he speaks only the truth.</i>

18:39.840 --> 18:42.434
<i>He is coming.</i>

18:42.520 --> 18:44.636
<i>The three-fold man,</i>

18:44.720 --> 18:48.190
<i>he dances in the lonely places.</i>

18:48.640 --> 18:51.871
<i>Oh, creator of us all,</i>

18:51.960 --> 18:54.474
<i>the Doctor is coming!</i>

19:20.960 --> 19:22.916
You need sustenance.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.116
Take the water. It purifies.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.113
Thanks.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.589
There was something on your back.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.552
How did you know that?

19:32.640 --> 19:34.915
You are something new.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.513
Not me.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.399
I'm just a temp.
Shorthand, filing, 100 words per minute.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.995
Fat lot of good that is now.
I'm no use to anyone.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.991
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.674
Yeah.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.270
My whole planet's gone.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.920
I mean the loss that is yet to come.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.317
God save you.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.034
Donna, think, Earth. There must
have been some sort of warning.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.270
Was anything happening back in your day,

20:08.360 --> 20:11.193
like electrical storms,
freak weather, patterns in the sky?

20:11.280 --> 20:13.316
Well, how should I know?

20:13.400 --> 20:16.437
Erm, no. I don't think so. No.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.636
- Okay, never mind.
- Although...

20:21.600 --> 20:23.670
There were the bees disappearing.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.671
The bees disappearing?

20:26.160 --> 20:28.037
The bees disappearing.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.637
The bees disappearing!

20:30.720 --> 20:33.837
- How is that significant?
- On Earth, we have these insects.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.638
Some people said it was pollution
or mobile phone signals.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.871
- Or they were going back home.
- Back home where?

20:38.960 --> 20:40.837
Planet Melissa Majoria.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.469
- Are you saying bees are aliens?
- Don't be so daft. Not all of them.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.552
But if the migrant bees felt something
coming, some danger, and escaped...

20:47.640 --> 20:49.551
- Tandocca!
- The Tandocca Scale.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.232
The Tandocca Scale
is a series of wavelengths

20:51.320 --> 20:52.992
used as carrier signals by migrant bees.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.638
Infinitely small.
No wonder we didn't see it.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.278
It's like looking for
a speck of cinnamon in the Sahara.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.749
Look! There it is! The Tandocca trail!

20:58.840 --> 21:00.990
The transmat that moved the planets
was using the same wavelength.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.433
We can follow the path!

21:02.520 --> 21:04.511
And find the Earth!
Well, stop talking and do it!

21:04.600 --> 21:05.828
I am!

21:08.720 --> 21:10.756
We're a bit late.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.029
The signal's scattered but it's a start.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.636
I've got a blip! It's just a blip,
but it's definitely a blip.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.029
Then according to the strictures
of the Shadow Proclamation,

21:21.120 --> 21:23.998
I will have to seize your transport
and your technology.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.672
Oh, really? What for?

21:25.760 --> 21:28.035
The planets were stolen
with hostile intent.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.872
We are declaring war, Doctor.

21:29.960 --> 21:33.953
Right across the universe.
And you will lead us into battle!

21:34.680 --> 21:36.796
Right. Yes.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.118
Of course I will.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.230
I'll just go and get you the key.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.912
Doctor, come back!

21:56.080 --> 21:58.719
By the holy writ
of the Shadow Proclamation,

21:58.800 --> 22:01.075
I order you to stop!

22:01.680 --> 22:05.309
<i>All humans will leave their homes.</i>

22:05.400 --> 22:10.110
<i>The males, the females, the descendents,</i>

22:10.200 --> 22:12.031
<i>you will come with us!</i>

22:12.120 --> 22:14.509
<i>Resistance is useless.</i>

22:14.600 --> 22:19.037
<i>- Where are you taking us?
- Daleks do not answer human questions.</i>

22:19.120 --> 22:20.917
<i>Stand in line!</i>

22:21.000 --> 22:22.911
Dad, please, come home.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.275
- They're leaving our street alone.
- I've got a weapon.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.590
- It's a paint gun.
- Exactly.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.152
Them Dalek things,
they've only got one eye.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.674
A good splodge of paint,
they'd be blinded.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.672
We're not going! Do you hear me?

22:36.760 --> 22:39.035
Laura, get back inside the house.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.076
Simon, get inside! Go!

22:44.160 --> 22:45.752
Get back in the sky!

22:45.840 --> 22:48.957
Get back where you came from
and leave us alone!

22:50.520 --> 22:53.478
<i>Dalek attack formation seven.</i>

22:57.160 --> 22:59.879
<i>Maximum extermination!</i>

23:06.880 --> 23:10.395
- They're monsters.
- Please, Dad, come on.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.072
<i>Halt! You will come with me.</i>

23:17.160 --> 23:18.639
Will I heck!

23:22.720 --> 23:25.518
<i>My vision is not impaired!</i>

23:25.600 --> 23:27.079
I warned you, Dad.

23:27.160 --> 23:31.517
<i>Hostility will not be tolerated!
Exterminate! Exterminate!</i>

23:31.600 --> 23:32.919
<i>Exter...</i>

23:41.680 --> 23:43.557
Do you wanna swap?

23:43.640 --> 23:45.596
You're Donna Noble's family, right?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.875
I'm Rose Tyler. And I need you.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.999
Yeah, I've tried calling her,
but I can't get through.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.638
But she's still with the Doctor.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.917
I know that much.
And the last time she phoned,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.037
it was from a planet called Midnight,
made of diamonds.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.829
- What the hell are you two on about?
- Look, she's out there, sweetheart.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.638
Your daughter.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.109
She's travelling the stars
with that Doctor.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.668
- She always has been.
- Don't be ridiculous.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.830
Oh, come on, open your eyes.
Look at the sky.

24:12.920 --> 24:17.277
Look at... Look at the Daleks.
You can't start denying things now.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.998
You were my last hope.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.436
If we can't find Donna,
we can't find the Doctor.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.278
Where is he?

24:37.480 --> 24:40.358
- It's stopped.
- What do you mean?

24:41.400 --> 24:44.790
Is that good or bad? Where are we?

24:44.880 --> 24:46.552
The Medusa Cascade.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.149
I came here when I was just a kid,

24:59.240 --> 25:00.992
90 years old.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.475
It was the centre of a rift
in time and space.

25:05.560 --> 25:09.314
So, where are the 27 planets?

25:09.400 --> 25:11.391
Nowhere.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.391
The Tandocca trail stops dead.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.797
End of the line.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.398
So what do we do?

25:23.160 --> 25:25.037
Doctor, what do we do?

25:27.160 --> 25:29.151
Now, don't do this to me.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.319
No, don't.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.717
Don't do this to me.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.231
Not now.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.629
Tell me what are we going to do.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.511
You never give up.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.108
Please!

25:54.880 --> 25:58.077
<i>This is the Commander General
of the United Nations</i>

25:58.160 --> 26:00.230
<i>calling the Dalek fleet.</i>

26:00.320 --> 26:03.835
<i>We surrender. Repeat, we surrender.</i>

26:04.400 --> 26:06.550
<i>Planet Earth surrenders.</i>

26:06.640 --> 26:08.915
<i>...humans selected for testing</i>

26:09.000 --> 26:12.549
<i>will follow Dalek instructions.</i>

26:12.640 --> 26:15.313
<i>The Daleks reign supreme.</i>

26:15.400 --> 26:17.709
<i>All hail the Daleks!</i>

26:18.760 --> 26:23.197
<i>You will obey Dalek instructions
without question.</i>

26:23.280 --> 26:25.919
<i>You will obey your Dalek.</i>

26:32.240 --> 26:34.708
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

26:34.800 --> 26:39.112
<i>The Subwave Network is open.
You should be able to hear my voice.</i>

26:40.600 --> 26:42.431
<i>Is there anyone there?</i>

26:42.520 --> 26:44.192
I know that voice.

26:44.760 --> 26:48.036
- Who's that?
- Some poor soul calling for help.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.112
- There's nothing we can do.
- But look at Mr Smith.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.158
<i>Processing incoming Subwave.</i>

26:54.240 --> 26:56.629
<i>This message is of
the utmost importance.</i>

26:56.720 --> 26:58.551
<i>We haven't much time.</i>

26:59.560 --> 27:01.312
<i>Can anyone hear me?</i>

27:02.200 --> 27:04.634
Someone's trying to get in touch.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.634
The whole world's crying out.
Just leave it.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.234
<i>Captain Jack Harkness, shame on you!</i>

27:10.800 --> 27:12.870
<i>Now, stand to attention, sir.</i>

27:13.760 --> 27:15.352
What?

27:15.440 --> 27:17.271
Who is that?

27:18.720 --> 27:21.439
Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.551
Yeah, I know who you are.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.837
Harriet, it's me!
It's me! She can't hear me.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.512
Have you got a webcam?

27:28.600 --> 27:31.592
No, she wouldn't let me.
She said they're naughty.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.159
I can't speak to her then, can I?

27:33.240 --> 27:37.791
Sarah Jane Smith, 13 Bannerman Road,
are you there?

27:37.880 --> 27:39.916
Yeah, yeah, I'm here. That's me!

27:40.000 --> 27:41.228
<i>Good!</i>

27:41.320 --> 27:43.311
Now, let's see
if we can talk to each other.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.432
The fourth contact seems to be having
some trouble getting through.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.397
That's me! Harriet, that's me!

27:52.480 --> 27:54.516
<i>I'll just boost the signal.</i>

27:55.200 --> 27:56.474
<i>Hello?</i>

27:57.200 --> 27:58.519
Martha Jones!

27:58.600 --> 28:01.478
<i>- Who's she? I want to get through.
- Martha, where are you?</i>

28:01.560 --> 28:03.790
I guess Project Indigo
was more clever than we thought.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.110
One second I was in Manhattan...

28:07.160 --> 28:09.993
<i>Next second, maybe Indigo
tapped into my mind</i>

28:10.080 --> 28:13.390
<i>'cause I ended up
in the one place I wanted to be.</i>

28:15.840 --> 28:17.114
Mum?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.713
You came home.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.712
At the end of the world,
you came back to me.

28:25.880 --> 28:29.190
But then all of a sudden,
it's like the laptop turned itself on.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.589
It did. That was me.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.599
- Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.
- Yes, I know who you are.

28:36.680 --> 28:39.990
<i>I thought it was about time
we all met given the current crisis.</i>

28:40.080 --> 28:42.799
<i>Torchwood, this is Sarah Jane Smith.</i>

28:42.880 --> 28:46.236
<i>I've been following your work.
Nice job with the Slitheen.</i>

28:46.320 --> 28:48.880
Yeah, well, I've been staying away
from you lot.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.552
Too many guns.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.950
<i>All the same,
might I say, looking good, ma'am?</i>

28:54.680 --> 28:56.272
Really? Ooh!

28:56.360 --> 28:58.191
Not now, Captain.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.750
And Martha Jones,
former companion to the Doctor.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.071
- Oi, so was I!
- But how did you find me?

29:05.160 --> 29:08.391
<i>This, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the Subwave Network.</i>

29:08.600 --> 29:11.068
A sentient piece of software
programmed to seek out

29:11.160 --> 29:14.436
anyone and everyone
who can help to contact the Doctor.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.080
- What if the Daleks can here us?
- No.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.550
That's the beauty of the Subwave.
It's undetectable.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.677
- And you invented it?
- I developed it.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.194
It was created
by the Mr Copper Foundation.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.714
Yeah, but what we need right now
is a weapon.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.995
Martha, back at UNIT,
what did they give you?

29:31.080 --> 29:33.071
<i>What was that key thing?</i>

29:33.600 --> 29:34.919
The Osterhagen Key.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.230
That key is not to be used, Dr Jones.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.959
Not under any circumstances.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.871
But what is an Osterhagen Key?

29:41.960 --> 29:44.713
Forget about the key!
And that's an order!

29:44.800 --> 29:46.711
<i>All we need is the Doctor.</i>

29:46.800 --> 29:49.394
Oh, excuse me, Harriet,
but well, the thing is,

29:49.480 --> 29:51.675
if you're looking for the Doctor,
didn't he depose you?

29:51.760 --> 29:52.909
He did.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.310
And I've wondered about that
for a long time, whether I was wrong.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.436
But I stand by my actions to this day

29:58.520 --> 30:02.718
because I knew... I knew that one day,
the Earth would be in danger.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.473
And the Doctor would fail to appear.

30:05.560 --> 30:08.120
I told him so myself,
and he didn't listen.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.553
But I've been trying to find him.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.074
The Doctor's got my phone on the Tardis,
but I can't get through.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.071
Nor me. And I was here first.

30:14.160 --> 30:17.232
<i>That's why we need the Subwave.
To bring us all together.</i>

30:17.600 --> 30:20.876
Combine forces.
The Doctor's secret army.

30:21.960 --> 30:24.633
Wait a minute.
We boost the signal, that's it.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.834
We transmit that telephone number
through Torchwood itself,

30:27.920 --> 30:30.912
- using all the power of the rift...
- And we've got Mr Smith.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.674
<i>He can link up with
every telephone exchange on the Earth.</i>

30:33.760 --> 30:36.479
He can get the whole world to call
the same number all at the same time.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.755
Billions of phones
calling out all at once!

30:38.840 --> 30:41.434
Brilliant! Who's the kid?

30:41.520 --> 30:43.238
<i>That's my son.</i>

30:43.320 --> 30:44.799
Excuse me, sorry.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.836
Sorry, hello. lanto Jones.

30:46.920 --> 30:50.117
If we start transmitting,
then this Subwave Network

30:50.200 --> 30:53.112
is going to become visible,
I mean, to the Daleks.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.270
Yes, and they'll trace it back to me.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.078
But my life doesn't matter.

30:57.160 --> 30:59.116
Not if it saves the Earth.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.673
- Ma'am.
- Thank you, Captain.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.718
But there are people out there dying
on the streets.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.997
- Marvellous woman. I voted for her.
- You did not!

31:09.400 --> 31:11.994
Now, enough of words, let's begin.

31:16.280 --> 31:18.111
Grid power activated.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.916
All terminals coordinated.

31:29.440 --> 31:32.910
National Grid online,
giving you everything we've got.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.072
- Connecting you to Mr Smith.
- All telephone networks combined.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.156
Sending you the number now.

31:41.400 --> 31:46.554
Opening Subwave Network to maximum.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.398
Mr Smith?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.679
Make that call.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.399
<i>Calling the Doctor.</i>

31:53.480 --> 31:54.754
So am I.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.437
And sending!

32:21.720 --> 32:23.597
- Phone!
- Phone!

32:24.520 --> 32:26.590
Martha, is that you?

32:26.680 --> 32:29.399
- It's just a signal.
- Can we follow it?

32:29.480 --> 32:31.152
Just watch me.

32:32.680 --> 32:37.037
<i>Emergency! Unknown network detected!
Subwave frequency!</i>

32:37.120 --> 32:41.511
<i>Find the point of origin.
Find and exterminate!</i>

32:41.600 --> 32:44.239
<i>I warned you, Supreme One.</i>

32:44.320 --> 32:47.232
<i>Just as Dalek Caan foretold.</i>

32:47.320 --> 32:50.756
<i>The children of time
are moving against us.</i>

32:50.840 --> 32:54.355
<i>But everything is falling into place.</i>

33:00.760 --> 33:02.637
I think we got a fix!

33:02.720 --> 33:04.676
Mr Smith now at 200 %.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.798
Come on, Doctor!

33:21.440 --> 33:24.079
Find me, Doctor.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.912
Find me.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.751
Got it! Locking on.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.833
Harriet, a source's locked onto
your location.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.399
They found you.

33:39.480 --> 33:43.029
I know. I'm using the network
to mask your transmission. Keep going.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.599
<i>Exterminate!</i>

33:50.840 --> 33:53.354
We're travelling through time.

33:54.280 --> 33:57.590
One second in the future.
The phone call's pulling us through.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.238
Captain,

34:02.320 --> 34:05.790
I'm transferring the Subwave Network
to Torchwood.

34:05.880 --> 34:07.552
You're in charge now.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.870
And tell the Doctor from me,

34:09.960 --> 34:12.076
he chose his companions well.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.553
It's been an honour.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.795
Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister.

34:25.920 --> 34:29.310
<i>Yes, we know who you are!</i>

34:30.239 --> 34:32.594
Oh, you know nothing of any human.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.909
And that will be your downfall.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.429
<i>Exterminate!</i>

34:47.960 --> 34:51.190
Three, two, one!

35:07.600 --> 35:09.556
Twenty-seven planets.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.158
And there's the Earth.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.911
But why couldn't we see them?

35:15.000 --> 35:18.072
The entire Medusa Cascade
has been put a second out of sync

35:18.160 --> 35:19.593
with the rest of universe.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.389
Perfect hiding place. Tiny little pocket
of time, but we found them!

35:23.480 --> 35:24.959
Ooh, ooh.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.837
Ooh, what's that?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.831
Hold on, hold on.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.751
Some sort of Subwave Network.

35:33.480 --> 35:36.278
Where the hell have you been?
Doctor, it's the Daleks!

35:36.360 --> 35:38.078
Oh, he's a bit nice.
I thought he'd be older.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.354
He's not that young.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.590
<i>It's the Daleks, they're
taking people to their spaceship...</i>

35:43.640 --> 35:44.993
<i>...it's not just Dalek Caan!</i>

35:45.080 --> 35:47.674
- That's Donna!
- That's my girl!

35:47.760 --> 35:49.830
Sarah Jane! Who's that boy?

35:50.360 --> 35:52.191
That must be Torchwood.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.909
Aren't they brilliant?
Look at you all, you clever people.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.312
That's Martha. And who's he?

36:00.400 --> 36:02.789
Captain Jack. Don't. Just...

36:03.800 --> 36:04.994
Don't.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.798
Doctor, it's me.

36:07.480 --> 36:08.913
I came back.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.273
It's like
an outer space Facebook.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.032
Everyone except Rose.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.717
<i>He is here.</i>

36:23.800 --> 36:27.315
<i>The Dark Lord is come!</i>

36:27.400 --> 36:31.473
<i>Supreme One, this Subwave Network,
I will address it. Give me access.</i>

36:34.160 --> 36:36.116
- We've lost them.
- No, no, no, no.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.555
There's another signal coming through.
There's someone else out there.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.710
Hello? Can you hear me?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.028
Rose.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.588
<i>Your voice is different and yet</i>

36:46.400 --> 36:50.029
<i>its arrogance is unchanged.</i>

36:50.120 --> 36:51.394
No.

36:52.360 --> 36:53.952
But he's dead.

36:55.240 --> 36:58.710
<i>Welcome to my new empire, Doctor.</i>

36:59.680 --> 37:03.514
<i>It is only fitting that you should
bear witness to the resurrection</i>

37:03.600 --> 37:06.478
<i>and the triumph of Davros,</i>

37:06.560 --> 37:11.156
<i>lord and creator of the Dalek race.</i>

37:13.560 --> 37:14.754
Doctor.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.638
<i>Have you nothing to say?</i>

37:17.720 --> 37:19.631
Doctor, it's all right.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.231
We're in the Tardis.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.753
We're safe.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.674
But you were destroyed.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.320
In the very first year of the Time War
at the Gates of Elysium.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.870
I saw your command ship fly
into the jaws of the Nightmare Child.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.234
I tried to save you.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.039
<i>But it took one stronger than you.</i>

37:37.120 --> 37:39.475
<i>Dalek Caan himself.</i>

37:39.560 --> 37:43.314
<i>I flew into the wild and fire.</i>

37:43.400 --> 37:47.473
<i>I danced and died a thousand times.</i>

37:47.560 --> 37:52.270
<i>Emergency temporal shift took him back
into the Time War itself.</i>

37:52.360 --> 37:54.590
But that's impossible!
The entire war is time-locked!

37:54.680 --> 37:56.511
<i>And yet he succeeded.</i>

37:56.600 --> 37:59.990
<i>Oh, it cost him his mind, but imagine,</i>

38:00.080 --> 38:03.550
<i>a single simple Dalek succeeded</i>

38:03.640 --> 38:07.474
<i>where emperors and Time Lords
have failed.</i>

38:08.200 --> 38:12.910
<i>A testament, don't you think,
to my remarkable creations?</i>

38:13.440 --> 38:16.113
And you made a new race of Daleks.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.751
<i>I gave myself to them.</i>

38:19.240 --> 38:20.832
<i>Quite literally.</i>

38:21.240 --> 38:25.995
<i>Each one grown from a cell
of my own body.</i>

38:28.960 --> 38:32.589
<i>New Daleks. True Daleks.</i>

38:33.080 --> 38:35.594
<i>I have my children, Doctor.</i>

38:36.400 --> 38:39.073
<i>What do you have now?</i>

38:39.640 --> 38:43.952
After all this time,
everything we saw, everything we lost,

38:45.160 --> 38:47.310
I have only one thing to say to you.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.189
Bye!

38:52.880 --> 38:57.954
<i>Emergency!
Locate the Tardis! Find the Doctor!</i>

38:58.040 --> 39:02.192
<i>He will go to the Earth
to find his precious human allies.</i>

39:02.280 --> 39:04.396
<i>And death is coming.</i>

39:04.480 --> 39:07.233
<i>Oh, I can see it.</i>

39:07.320 --> 39:09.151
<i>Everlasting death</i>

39:09.240 --> 39:12.198
<i>for the most faithful companion.</i>

39:13.080 --> 39:17.198
<i>Subwave Network rerouted!
New location, Torchwood!</i>

39:17.280 --> 39:20.238
<i>Then exterminate them at once!</i>

39:20.320 --> 39:23.073
<i>Exterminate Torchwood!</i>

39:25.600 --> 39:27.238
Gwen.

39:27.320 --> 39:30.710
Dalek saucer heading for the Bay.
They've found us.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.189
Martha, open that Indigo device.
Listen to me.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.919
Lift the central panel, there's a string
of numbers that keep changing.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.560
<i>But the fourth number keeps oscillating
between two different digits.</i>

39:38.640 --> 39:41.518
<i>- Tell me what they are.
- It's a four and a nine.</i>

39:41.600 --> 39:45.434
- We could never work out what that was.
- Yeah! That's a teleport base code.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.592
And that's all I need
to get this thing working again.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.788
Oscillating four and nine.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.750
Thank you, Martha Jones.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.278
I gotta go. I gotta find the Doctor.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.313
I'll come back.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.070
- I'm coming back.
- Don't worry about us. Just go.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.628
- We'll be fine.
You'd better be.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.671
<i>Exterminate!</i>

40:27.760 --> 40:30.149
<i>- Exterminate!
- They're here.</i>

40:30.800 --> 40:34.076
<i>Tardis heading for vector 7.
Grid reference 6-6...</i>

40:34.160 --> 40:36.037
- There are Daleks out there.
- I know.

40:36.120 --> 40:39.749
I'm sorry, but I have got to find
the Doctor.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.910
Don't move, don't leave the house,
don't do anything.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.554
<i>I will protect the boy, Sarah Jane.</i>

40:47.360 --> 40:48.952
I love you.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.678
Remember that.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.636
Control, I need another shift.
Lock me onto the Tardis. Now.

41:09.320 --> 41:11.880
Right, I'm gonna find him.

41:12.520 --> 41:13.919
Wish me luck.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.309
- Oh, good luck!
- Yeah, good luck, sweetheart.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.112
It's like a ghost town.

41:30.200 --> 41:32.634
Sarah Jane said
they were taking the people.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.119
What for? Think, Donna.

41:34.200 --> 41:37.158
When you met Rose in that
parallel world, what did she say?

41:37.240 --> 41:39.993
Just, "The darkness is coming. "

41:40.080 --> 41:41.593
Anything else?

41:45.360 --> 41:47.749
Why don't you ask her yourself?

42:33.440 --> 42:35.032
<i>Exterminate!</i>

42:47.720 --> 42:51.793
I've got you. It missed you.
Look, it's me, Doctor.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.836
- Rose.
- Right.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.677
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.637
Been busy, you know.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.430
Don't die. No, don't die.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.438
My God, don't die.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.634
Get him into the Tardis, quick. Move!

43:13.160 --> 43:14.718
But they don't work against Daleks.

43:14.800 --> 43:20.636
Yeah? Well, I'm going out fighting.
Like Owen, like Tosh. How about you?

43:22.640 --> 43:23.914
<i>Exterminate!</i>

43:24.000 --> 43:25.513
<i>- Yes, ma'am!
- Exterminate!</i>

43:28.520 --> 43:30.556
What do we do?

43:30.640 --> 43:32.756
There must be some medicine,
or something.

43:32.840 --> 43:36.753
Just step back.
Rose, do as I say and get back!

43:36.840 --> 43:39.798
He's dying.
And you know what happens next.

43:39.880 --> 43:41.996
- What do you mean?
- He can't.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.435
Not now. I came all this way.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.954
What do you mean? What happens next?

43:52.480 --> 43:54.198
It's starting.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.799
<i>All human transport is forbidden!</i>

44:12.880 --> 44:14.791
I surrender! I'm sorry!

44:14.880 --> 44:19.192
<i>Daleks do not accept apologies!
You will be exterminated!</i>

44:19.280 --> 44:21.316
<i>- Exterminate!
- Exterminate!</i>

44:28.320 --> 44:30.151
<i>Exterminate!</i>

44:30.520 --> 44:32.078
<i>Exterminate!</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:40.156
Here we go. Good luck, Doctor!

44:40.240 --> 44:42.151
Will someone
please tell me what is going on?

44:42.240 --> 44:46.074
When he's dying, his body,
it repairs itself. It changes.

44:46.720 --> 44:48.233
But you can't!

44:48.320 --> 44:50.754
I'm sorry, it's too late.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.676
I'm regenerating.
