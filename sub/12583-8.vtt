WEBVTT

00:32.407 --> 00:33.324
Yep.

00:33.992 --> 00:34.951
Yup.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.536


00:36.619 --> 00:37.746
-What the...
-Hey, man, don't...

00:37.829 --> 00:38.747
Don't sting me!

00:38.913 --> 00:41.332
Dale, what the heck
are you doing with bees?

00:41.666 --> 00:42.709
Some guy hired me

00:42.792 --> 00:44.210
to clear them out of his attic.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.838
I was gonna kill 'em, but how could I?

00:46.921 --> 00:48.214
Just look at 'em.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.091
Aren't they adorable?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.052
I guess they are kind of cute.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.762
And they're entrepreneurs.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.346
These babies make honey.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.599
And honey is money, my friend.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.434
What do you know about beekeeping?

00:59.517 --> 01:02.479
I know how to keep them
from crawling up my nose.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.152
The clones are coming, Master Joseph.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.696
We must reach Jedi Council.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.657
Oh, no, the landing bay door is closing!

01:14.741 --> 01:15.658


01:16.743 --> 01:20.038
Oh, uh, use the Force
to roll under the door.

01:29.672 --> 01:30.548


01:30.632 --> 01:32.884
Easy now, fellas.

01:33.968 --> 01:34.928
-Nothing.

01:35.011 --> 01:35.887


01:37.305 --> 01:38.348


01:38.431 --> 01:40.350
Dangit, Bobby. You bent the track.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.144
You fix bent stuff
all the time, though, right?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.647
I can't fix this, I have to get a new one.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.233
Which means I'll have to file
an insurance claim.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.150
Really?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.653
So any time you break something,

01:51.736 --> 01:53.446
insurance gets you a new one?

01:54.739 --> 01:57.408
Hey, if you back the car into my bike,

01:57.492 --> 02:00.620
we can get a new car and a new bike.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.872
No, Bobby, it doesn't work that way.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.084
Insurance is a safety net
woven from the trust

02:06.209 --> 02:08.795
between the policyholder
and the guarantor.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.133
Insurance only covers accidents.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.051
Accident.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.261
Got ya.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.645
On our way to the outlets tomorrow,

02:25.728 --> 02:28.273
I was thinking, Luanne and I
could stop for lunch

02:28.356 --> 02:30.441
at the Shoney's off Exit-25.

02:31.734 --> 02:33.194
What, you don't like that one?

02:33.278 --> 02:35.113
No, it's a good Shoney's.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.657
I'm just so frustrated with Bobby.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.451
He thinks insurance is some magic fairy

02:40.535 --> 02:41.870
who just waves her wand

02:41.953 --> 02:44.455
and makes teenage jack-assery disappear.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.707
Her wand?

02:45.790 --> 02:48.459
Huh, I always think of insurance as a boy.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.005
Welcome to the Gribble Honey Bucket.

02:52.088 --> 02:55.717
You are about to witness
how Mother Nature turns a profit.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.386
Gentlemen, don your helmets.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.363
I'm on my way.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.990
I've struck gold.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.492
Yummy, sticky gold.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.872
Okay, Dad, the ladies
are finally out of our hair.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.833
What's first, a matinee or putt-putt golf?

03:28.917 --> 03:31.878
I thought we'd have
a talk about responsibility.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.213
Oh.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.298
Now, since you were horsing around

03:35.381 --> 03:36.633
and broke the garage door,

03:36.716 --> 03:38.968
-you're gonna have to take care of it.
-Wait...

03:39.052 --> 03:41.721
You said insurance was taking care of it.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.515
The claim settlement
won't just come down the chimney

03:44.599 --> 03:45.892
like Santa Claus.

03:45.975 --> 03:49.062
Someone has to make the calls
and file the papers.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.730
That's me, right?

03:50.813 --> 03:53.858
I want you to know
our policy inside and out

03:53.942 --> 03:57.403
before you call Mitch Watson
down at the insurance agency.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.822
Don't waste his time,
he'll hang up on you.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.670
How much are you gonna charge
for your honey, Dale?

04:13.753 --> 04:14.712
Uh, these people

04:14.796 --> 04:17.715
pay five dollars
for a carton of filthy mushrooms,

04:17.799 --> 04:20.343
so what do you think, $100? $150?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.220
So where do you want me?

04:22.303 --> 04:23.137
Gone.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.391
The ladies with their trendy scarves
and fancy coffees

04:26.474 --> 04:28.810
won't come near this place
with you hanging around.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.687
You're absolutely right.

04:32.230 --> 04:35.275
Come and get your freshly secreted honey!

04:35.441 --> 04:38.444
Don't be put off
by Irwin Allen's <i>The Swarm</i>

04:38.528 --> 04:42.657
or the tedious Peter Fonda film
<i>Ulee's Gold.</i>

04:42.740 --> 04:44.450
Look, Alison, bees.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.245
I heard Jenna Elfman
on <i>Access Hollywood</i> talking about

04:47.328 --> 04:49.789
how you can cure anything
with the venom from bee stings.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.040
Bee stings?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.542
Yeah, bee stings?

04:52.625 --> 04:53.960
My nutritionist says

04:54.043 --> 04:56.379
it stimulates your body's
natural healing response.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.464
A friend of mine used it during childbirth

04:58.548 --> 05:00.133
instead of an epidural.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.719
How many stings do I get for $150?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.846
Uh, mm...

05:04.929 --> 05:08.516
Um, well, the going rate is, uh... 12?

05:08.599 --> 05:09.976
That's a really good deal.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.769
Mm-hmm, it really is.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.438
Oh, okay.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.859
Okay, so, do you wanna
get up on the table?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.736
Or would you rather have me shake it up

05:19.819 --> 05:21.404
and dump some out on you?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.447
Mmm.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.823
I'm still hungry.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.158
You wanna do another lap?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.160
Interest you fellas
in a fried banana?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.621
You... you can fry a banana?

05:30.705 --> 05:32.248
But it's fruit.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.252
Here, just try one.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.506
-Mm-hm...
-Mmm.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.550
Oh, this banana's delicious.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.261
The monkeys must never find out.

05:46.054 --> 05:46.888
<i>Okay,</i>

05:46.971 --> 05:48.014
last question.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.808
Our policy is an HO-A Plus.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.185
What does it cover?

05:52.268 --> 05:54.687
All major perils except sinkhole,

05:54.771 --> 05:56.606
nuclear accident, and war.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.316
I think you're ready for Mitch.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.442
I'll listen in.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.320
If Mitch asks,
tell him this call is being monitored

06:02.403 --> 06:03.780
for quality assurance.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.786
<i>Hello, this is Plainsman Insurance.</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:12.121
<i>This call may be monitored
for quality assurance.</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:14.082
Good afternoon.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.750
My name is Robert Hill,

06:15.833 --> 06:19.087
policy number G-75-658.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.339
May I please speak to Mitch?

06:21.422 --> 06:22.465
<i>Mitch is not here.</i>

06:22.548 --> 06:24.342
Okay, then. Thanks.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.095
Uh, this is Hank Hill, policyholder.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.554
When will Mitch be back?

06:28.638 --> 06:30.973
<i>Uh, he is in the 'loo.
Bathroom. Bathroom.</i>

06:31.057 --> 06:32.433
<i>And according to our records,</i>

06:32.517 --> 06:34.477
<i>your policy has been canceled
for non-payment.</i>

06:34.560 --> 06:36.020
Canceled? Listen here,

06:36.104 --> 06:37.897
I have never missed a payment.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.900
I'm coming down there right now
so I can straighten this out.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.527
Tell Mitch I'm on my way.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.529
<i>Uh, Plainsman's customer
service operations</i>

06:44.612 --> 06:46.322
<i>have been moved to a central call center</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:48.116
<i>so we may serve you more efficiently.</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:49.242
<i>I'll be happy to help you.</i>

06:49.325 --> 06:51.077
Just give me your new address.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.246
And remember,
we're all being monitored here.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.582
<i>Actually, Mr. Hill,
uh, we are in Bangalore, India.</i>

06:56.666 --> 06:57.667
India?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.752
No wonder you guys lost my payment.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.130
I demand to speak to your supervisor.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.214
<i>Please hold.</i>

07:03.297 --> 07:04.507
Bobby, grab my checkbook.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.093
I'm gonna kick this guy's ass
over the phone.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.846
<i>Hello,
am I speaking to the gentleman</i>

07:09.929 --> 07:11.097
<i>with the delinquent account?</i>

07:11.180 --> 07:13.599
No, listen, there's been a mistake.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.144
I sent you my payment on...

07:16.602 --> 07:17.812
on, uh...

07:20.356 --> 07:22.108
<i>I'm sorry, could you repeat that?</i>

07:26.028 --> 07:29.031
Dad, if we go to India
to straighten this out,

07:29.115 --> 07:30.908
can I ride an elephant?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.743
Just, just give me a second.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.747
Bobby, sit down.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.625
All right, here's where we're at.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.295
I made a big...

07:42.378 --> 07:43.671
big mistake.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.633
We've got no insurance.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.510
Okay.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.388
Bobby, don't you realize
how important this is?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.765
All our policies have lapsed.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.351
Our house, everything in it,
our vehicles...

07:57.435 --> 07:58.978
Nothing is protected.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.355
The safety net's gone... gone.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.108
I hear the words you're saying.

08:04.192 --> 08:07.487
And I believe you believe
it's important...

08:07.570 --> 08:09.071
Dangit, don't you get it?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.364
We've...

08:10.448 --> 08:11.741
Okay, okay...

08:11.824 --> 08:14.327
Nothing good happens
when a homeowner panics.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.912
Now, we need a plan.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.997
I'll overnight a check to Plainsman.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.708
That way, we'll be covered again
as of Monday morning.

08:20.791 --> 08:24.045
But we've still got to make it
through the next 36 hours.

08:24.128 --> 08:27.590
Hey, we could go to Six Flags
and get a two-day pass.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.842
Ooh, I think they call it a Twicket.

08:29.926 --> 08:33.054
No. We have to stay home
and keep an eye on the house.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.514
Here's what we're gonna do.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.725
I'll inspect and secure
the house's vital systems

08:37.808 --> 08:38.893
starting with the plumbing,

08:38.976 --> 08:40.770
while you test all the smoke alarms.

08:40.853 --> 08:43.272
All right. Just let me make some toast.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.232
No toast.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.900
Not until I check the circuitry.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.861
Now, I'd better call your mother
and tell her to stay put.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.988
While I'm gone, don't cook anything,

08:51.072 --> 08:53.658
flush anything or turn anything on.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.869
Not insured?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.037
That's terrible.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.498
No, you're right, we can't risk it.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.958
Okay, we won't drive.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.001
Are you serious?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.295
I promise we won't drive.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.382
Well, Luanne, it turns out
we are uninsured,

09:09.465 --> 09:13.344
so your Uncle Hank wants us to stay here
until everything's straightened out.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.555
But I don't wanna stay here.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.848
Oh, what if we just drive home

09:17.932 --> 09:19.350
really, really, really, really fast?

09:19.433 --> 09:21.310
That way we won't be on the road as long.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.187
No, Luanne. If something happened,

09:23.271 --> 09:24.647
we couldn't afford another car.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.983
So we'll just stay here
and make the best of it.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.610
We just have to be creative.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.861
From now on...

09:30.945 --> 09:33.698
...let's talk like this!

09:35.575 --> 09:37.076
It's true.

09:37.159 --> 09:41.330
Bee venom is the penicillin
of the 21st century.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.625
It cures everything
from toothaches to ADD.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.877
Isn't that right, young Joseph?

09:47.211 --> 09:50.798
Uh, my head hurt, but now it doesn't.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.926
Step right up and tell me what ails you.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.303
My neck's kind of stiff.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.388
Eight bee stings. You?

09:57.471 --> 09:58.389
I feel fine.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.433
Six bee stings. You?

10:00.516 --> 10:01.517
Planter's wart.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.560
Ew!

10:02.643 --> 10:03.978
Thirteen bee stings.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.149
How come Mom's not allowed to come home?

10:08.232 --> 10:09.650
Weren't you listening, Bobby?

10:09.734 --> 10:10.985
This is serious.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.653
We've all got to do our part

10:12.737 --> 10:14.238
to get through this weekend.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.198
Have you checked
the smoke alarm in the hallway?

10:16.282 --> 10:18.117
No, but it's just a hallway.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.244
There's nothing there to catch on fire.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.205
A hallway is the expressway flames use

10:23.289 --> 10:24.874
to spread to the rest of the house.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.918
Maybe that's just something
the guy at Mega-Lo-Mart told you

10:28.002 --> 10:29.962
so you'd buy more smoke detectors?

10:30.046 --> 10:33.007
Dang it, Bobby, this isn't
about some sales pitch.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.551
Fire can burn down a house like that,

10:35.635 --> 10:37.553
and our equity's gone.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.222
Fifteen years
of house payments for nothing,

10:40.306 --> 10:43.142
because without insurance
we couldn't afford to rebuild.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.143
Huh?

10:44.226 --> 10:46.520
We'd have to set up a tent on the ashes

10:46.604 --> 10:48.147
of what used to be this house.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.148
A tent?

10:49.231 --> 10:51.651
Where would I put
all my clothes in a tent?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.778
Oh, your clothes would be gone, Bobby.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.071
You'd have to wear the clothes

10:55.154 --> 10:56.614
that Reverend Stroup collects

10:56.697 --> 10:58.449
for poor people at the church.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.950
Toughskins?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.119
Yep. And it's not just fire,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.663
it's tornadoes, lightning,

11:03.746 --> 11:05.414
golf ball-sized hail

11:05.498 --> 11:07.667
that can destroy everything we've got.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.627
Now, why don't you go
and check the strapping

11:09.710 --> 11:10.670
on the water heater?

11:10.753 --> 11:14.382
Texas hasn't had
a major earthquake in 165 years.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.466
We're due.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.930
It's so much better frying at home.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.431
I can eat fried bananas

11:22.515 --> 11:23.933
while looking at Hank's house.

11:32.817 --> 11:33.776
Really?

11:33.859 --> 11:35.319
Fry a candy bar?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.029
That's crazy. Okay!

11:42.118 --> 11:43.619
Take it out! Take it out!

11:44.537 --> 11:45.371
Ooh!

11:45.454 --> 11:46.622
Hot. Hot.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.790
So good. Burning!

11:47.873 --> 11:50.042
Oh! Chocolate... choc...

11:50.126 --> 11:51.794
Mmm...

11:51.877 --> 11:53.879
If we can fry a candy bar,

11:53.963 --> 11:55.548
we can fry anything!

11:58.551 --> 12:01.971
Isn't it a beautiful night, Aunt Peggy?

12:02.054 --> 12:03.597
Luanne, just stop it!

12:03.681 --> 12:05.391
Well, I'm getting hungry,

12:05.474 --> 12:07.393
and unless you want to go hunt a squirrel,

12:07.476 --> 12:09.729
I guess we are eating
at the vending machine.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.440
I only have 20s.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.899
Do you have anything smaller?

12:14.483 --> 12:16.277
I only have nothing.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.919
Yeah, I got this box of bees
for Dale Gribble,

12:34.003 --> 12:34.879
but no one's home.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.130
Mind if I leave it with you?

12:36.630 --> 12:37.465
Dad?

12:37.548 --> 12:39.884
Situation at the front door.

12:39.967 --> 12:40.801
Coming!

12:41.302 --> 12:42.219
Can I help you?

12:42.303 --> 12:45.473
Yeah, your neighbor, he bought these
ten pounds of bees from me.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.851
I was gonna leave it over there,
but ain't no one home,

12:48.934 --> 12:50.436
so I was hoping I could
leave it over here.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.021
Mind I leave it here?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.107
You're gonna have to go.

12:56.025 --> 12:56.984
This, too.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.528
Okay, good job calling me, Bobby,

12:59.612 --> 13:01.989
but the next time,
don't even open the door.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.824
It's our last line of defense.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.368
I know the mat says "Welcome," but...

13:06.452 --> 13:07.912
Actually, I better pick that up.

13:21.592 --> 13:24.303
If everybody fried their food,
there would be no war.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.262
Mm-hmm.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.139
What shall we try next, Boomhauer?

13:27.223 --> 13:29.850
Tell you what, man, talkin' 'bout
dang ol' fried fried chicken, man.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.019
Fried chicken refried?

13:32.102 --> 13:33.103
Damn.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.606
So hot and good.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.650
I wonder if more heat
would make it more good?

13:37.733 --> 13:41.028
Tell you what, man, talkin' 'bout,
dang ol' more hotter, more better, man.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.115
Whatcha doing?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.075
Frying.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.163
My favorite arm!

13:51.247 --> 13:52.623
It looks pretty bad, Dale.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.166
Do you need to go to the doctor?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.459
One doctor?

13:55.543 --> 13:58.838
I'm gonna go to about 2,000 buzzing ones.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.928
Stop it, stomach!

14:06.011 --> 14:07.263
You're scaring me!

14:07.346 --> 14:09.849
Aunt Peggy, did you find change?

14:09.932 --> 14:13.477
No. But it's been 18 hours,
and we need to eat.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.563
Now, pick up the back end of this branch.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.856
We're going in.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.151
Three, two, one.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.487
Soup's on!

14:33.080 --> 14:33.998
Yes!

14:37.209 --> 14:38.919
We buried the needle, Boomhauer!

14:39.003 --> 14:41.672
We're frying where no man
has fried before!

14:42.006 --> 14:42.923
Mm!

14:43.007 --> 14:45.050
A cold beer is going to taste so good

14:45.134 --> 14:46.510
with this scalding hot fish.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.679
Ooh! Oh!

14:53.100 --> 14:54.768
Ooh...

15:05.321 --> 15:07.281
I want insurance!

15:08.365 --> 15:09.491
How's your shoulder?

15:09.575 --> 15:10.951
I could use a Coke.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.124
Root beer?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.879
One more sting and my treatment
will be complete.

15:22.546 --> 15:23.839
And...

15:24.548 --> 15:25.799
cured.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.510
Okay, Joseph, take that stick and poke me

15:28.594 --> 15:30.888
in my once-again robust arm.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.601
See, I don't feel a thing.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.561
Wait a minute.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.104
I don't feel a thing!

15:39.188 --> 15:40.981
Your venom did nothing!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.399
You betrayed me!

15:42.483 --> 15:44.276
Well, you may have destroyed my arm,

15:44.360 --> 15:46.737
but my legs are
still feeble yet functional!

15:49.448 --> 15:50.282
Oh.

16:00.876 --> 16:01.794
Bobby, open the door!

16:01.877 --> 16:03.212
The bees are coming!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.214
Dad! Situation!

16:05.297 --> 16:07.424
Bobby, quick! Help me!

16:07.508 --> 16:09.134
Sorry, Mr. Gribble!

16:09.218 --> 16:11.679
You're a potential property hazard!

16:11.762 --> 16:13.347
Come back Monday!

16:14.807 --> 16:16.058
Open up!

16:24.525 --> 16:27.194
Bobby, why the heck's the radio so loud?

16:27.277 --> 16:30.239
Mr. Gribble ran over, screaming for help!

16:32.074 --> 16:35.327
For the love of God, Bobby,
have mercy!

16:40.124 --> 16:41.250
Oh, God!

16:41.333 --> 16:42.960
Bobby, why didn't you help him?

16:43.043 --> 16:44.837
Why didn't you call 911?

16:44.920 --> 16:47.131
I was securing the perimeter!

16:47.214 --> 16:49.216
Yeah, I'd like to report
a man being chased

16:49.299 --> 16:50.843
by a swarm of bees.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.012
I see.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.597
The emergency vehicles are all tied up.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.391
Good. The last thing we need

16:57.474 --> 17:00.310
are fire trucks and ambulances
racing over here.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.604
They'd probably take
that corner too fast and bam!

17:02.688 --> 17:03.731
Right in the living room.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.527
Come on.

17:08.610 --> 17:10.237
Dale's in trouble.
We need to go out there.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.697
Out there? With the bees

17:11.780 --> 17:13.657
and the hail and the A-bombs?

17:13.741 --> 17:16.493
Bobby, I think you're getting
a little carried away.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.959
And I guess I pushed you there.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.086
I didn't mean to scare you, son.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.172
Sure, I wish we had insurance.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.424
Because there is a chance
something bad could happen

17:30.507 --> 17:31.633
to the house if we leave it.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.469
But something bad
is definitely gonna happen

17:33.552 --> 17:34.511
to Dale if we don't.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.644
If we go outside,
are you sure everything will be okay?

17:42.728 --> 17:44.813
There's nothing out there we can't handle.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.398
I promise.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.736
Okay, Dad.

17:58.035 --> 17:58.869
Goddang, man.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.165
Good lord.

18:09.588 --> 18:10.714
Where are you going, Bobby?

18:10.798 --> 18:12.299
This is not a big deal.

18:12.382 --> 18:13.842
It's just a little fire.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.386
And more bees than I remembered.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.058
Hey, Dale! Run to your van!

18:28.690 --> 18:30.317
There, no problem.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.236
Now, Dale's arm looked pretty bad,

18:32.319 --> 18:33.946
so we should make sure he's okay.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.618
Fire!

18:39.701 --> 18:40.828
Good eye, Bobby.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.331
We can easily put that out
with some potting soil.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.586
Heh, did you ever think
you'd see a fire in the alley?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.797
Kind of funny when you think
about it, isn't it?

18:53.882 --> 18:55.467
Yeah, funny.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.430
Hey, hey, man, what...

19:00.514 --> 19:02.474
Goddang ol', man!

19:04.184 --> 19:05.853
Ah...

19:08.647 --> 19:09.773
Hot, hot...

19:11.650 --> 19:14.027
Mr. Dauterive's on fire!

19:14.111 --> 19:15.112
That'll happen.

19:15.195 --> 19:16.697
Roll, Bill, roll!

19:21.785 --> 19:23.996
Just flaming potatoes, Bobby.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.330
Why don't we put those out?

19:35.090 --> 19:38.886
Joseph, I'm having some sort of reaction.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.055
But I'm only allergic to shellfish and...

19:43.098 --> 19:44.224
bees.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.934
Joseph, I...

19:46.602 --> 19:47.519
Huh.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.438
You never were here, were you?

19:50.063 --> 19:51.190
This could be bad.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.484
Mouth is so dry.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.828
Hank, I don't feel so good.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.164
That's why we're gonna take you
to the hospital.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.415
Come on. Let's go.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.002
Boomhauer, Bill's flared up again!

20:12.085 --> 20:13.462
Kick some dirt on him!

20:13.545 --> 20:15.297
Yeah, man. I dang ol' got it, man.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.508
Stupid bees.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.803
Look at that big purple one
trying to get in.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.435
Okay, let's get you to the hospital.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.738
That wasn't so bad.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.116
But I'll feel a lot better
when our coverage kicks in.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.119
Yep, you're gonna make
a great homeowner someday.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.497
Hey, how'd you like to help adjust

20:48.580 --> 20:50.540
the deductible on our umbrella policy?

20:50.624 --> 20:51.875
Would I?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.877
We'll call India in the morning.
