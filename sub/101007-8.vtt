00:06.320 --> 00:08.240
<i>I don't love you any more.</i>

00:08.320 --> 00:09.480
<i>But I didn't kill anyone.</i>

00:09.560 --> 00:11.680
I moved...
I moved the body.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.720
<i>That's been affecting me.</i>

00:15.640 --> 00:19.040
<i>Dad's busy at work right now.</i>
<i>Has he met someone else?</i>

00:19.120 --> 00:20.360
No.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.560
<i>So he just had enough.</i>

00:21.640 --> 00:23.280
Have you ever been
replaced, Marcella?

00:23.360 --> 00:25.120
<i>The victim was having</i>
<i>an affair with your husband.</i>

00:25.200 --> 00:26.200
<i>Giving someone everything,</i>

00:26.280 --> 00:28.400
<i>only to find out that</i>
<i>someone else can do it better,</i>

00:28.480 --> 00:30.760
<i>so they just throw you away.</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:34.720
<i>No! Come on, Juliet.</i>

00:35.280 --> 00:37.440
<i>I moved a body. I didn't...</i>

01:29.440 --> 01:30.680
Morning.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.200
Why are you doing this?

02:22.160 --> 02:23.280
I'm your friend.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.320
Your best friend.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.880
Whatever you've done, we can fix it,
I can help you.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.360
Do you remember when I said
I needed to succeed at something?

02:45.560 --> 02:48.040
I showed Sylvie Grace Tower last night.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.520
-She loved it.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.080
Hi.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.920
-Sure, come in.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.760
Have you heard anything
from Matthew?

03:26.680 --> 03:29.120
No. I'd call you if I had.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.440
You don't know if he's got any
friends or relatives in France, do you?

03:33.520 --> 03:36.080
This is the second time
you've come to talk to me about Matthew.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.840
Yep. Does he know anyone in France?

03:37.920 --> 03:39.520
No, not that I know of.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.080
This is my best friend.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.120
Please. Can you please tell me
what you think is going on?

03:47.200 --> 03:48.720
I think he killed your sister.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.800
-And the others...
-No.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.960
No. Matthew? Are you--
There's no way.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.480
What is it?
What about Yann?

03:59.560 --> 04:00.640
You... you arrested Yann?

04:00.720 --> 04:02.880
Yes. We found some evidence
on our latest victim,

04:02.960 --> 04:04.360
and Yann may be involved.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.360
-We don't know.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.560
Erm...

04:09.200 --> 04:10.440
Sorry, could you...

04:27.640 --> 04:29.120
Liz Harper.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.920
Did Matthew ever mention a Liz Harper?

04:32.760 --> 04:33.760
No.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.080
Sinnr

04:36.160 --> 04:37.240
What's that?

04:37.320 --> 04:39.840
It's an app, for casual sexual encounters.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.960
No. Matthew would never be unfaithful.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.640
What do I know? Maybe...

04:50.960 --> 04:53.680
I don't know him at all, do I?

05:10.240 --> 05:12.000
Did he have relationships with women?

05:12.080 --> 05:15.240
No, no, no.
Matthew... Matthew has always been gay.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.600
Yann on the other hand...

05:20.680 --> 05:23.120
Matthew said that Yann suggested that
they have a threesome,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.120
at one point with some woman he found.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.240
But Matthew said no.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.000
Yann, Matthew and another woman?

05:29.080 --> 05:30.400
It didn't happen.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.280
Great. Thank you.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.440
Do you know why he moved Grace's body?

05:44.360 --> 05:45.760
Not yet, no.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.840
Just find him.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.560
Promise me you'll find him.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.200
We will.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.840
Thanks.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.040
This is supposed to help me Best friend!

06:36.320 --> 06:39.000
They weren't meant to arrest Yann.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.640
-There was a plan, Matthew.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.320
A perfect plan. -Where you didn't get hurt.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.920
But you share the same fucking hairbrush,
you boys, don't you?

06:55.360 --> 06:58.880
So now they finally believe it's you.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.360
They think you're in France.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.480
But they're not going to find you.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.440
Plan was to set me up.

07:11.120 --> 07:16.040
Be a loyal friend.
Visit me in jail.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.080
Not to kill me.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.360
You can't kill me.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.440
Not me.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.320
DNA under Yann.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.960
It could have been from
Matthew's clothes, though.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.840
Matthew's got connections
to all the victims, apart from Liz Harper.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.200
To be fair, it's only half
a connection with one of them.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.800
Carol Fincher was in Yann's AA-group.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.280
Yes, but he could have met her.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.320
I guess. We do have a moved body,
that's not Matthew.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.960
So, are we back to thinking
they both could've done this together?

07:48.040 --> 07:51.360
Why move Grace?
Why move just one of the victims?

07:54.760 --> 07:58.160
That's the last thing Henry Gibson asked.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.360
Why did Matthew move Grace's body?

08:01.440 --> 08:02.800
Well, he couldn't have done.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.240
Exactly. But if they were
like brothers, as he says,

08:05.320 --> 08:06.720
he would have known
about the back problems.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.400
But the point is, he asked
why did Matthew move the body, not how.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.160
If he really wanted to clear him,

08:14.240 --> 08:17.280
then surely that's the first thing
he would've thought of, no?

08:18.480 --> 08:19.840
Laura?

08:20.960 --> 08:23.000
Look, we've got all this, okay?

08:23.080 --> 08:26.320
You've got a guy that's saying
"why" instead of "how."

08:26.400 --> 08:29.480
No. We focus on these two only.
Is that understood?

08:32.720 --> 08:33.840
Thank you.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.520
-Thanks very much. Yeah, cheers, bye.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.000
-Hey.
-Hi.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.320
You talked to Henry Gibson
the night Grace disappeared.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.880
Er, yeah, I did. Yeah.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.080
Do you remember what he said?

08:50.160 --> 08:52.320
Erm... well,
I gave everything to you guys.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
I know.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.680
Do you remember what he said?

08:57.280 --> 08:58.520
Right, erm...

09:01.160 --> 09:02.560
In here somewhere...

09:05.000 --> 09:07.360
-I'm fine.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.840
Good. Yeah, me too.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.200
Right, here it is. Er, yeah.
He was at a pub in Queen's Park.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.280
The Four Spades.
He was there till late.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.000
-Landlord confirmed.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.400
Er, the pub closed at 11:00.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.400
Great, thanks.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.040
You fancy dinner tonight?

09:27.120 --> 09:28.360
We'll see.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.640
<i>The Four Spades closed at 11:00.</i>

09:33.720 --> 09:36.600
If Henry drove fast, he could get to
Grace's house in the 20 minutes.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.680
And the murder could have happened
at any time up until 11:30.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.280
I need you to trace where
Henry's phone was that night.

09:43.360 --> 09:47.680
Now, listen, you know I can,
but I'm not sure I should.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.480
Rav told me not to.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.200
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.640
I'll see what I can do.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.560
Have you spoke to Matthew?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.120
No. Are you on Sinnr?

10:11.200 --> 10:12.400
What's that?

10:12.480 --> 10:15.280
Did you ever suggest a threesome
to Matthew with a woman?

10:15.360 --> 10:17.960
Well, we're both gay.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.720
You... you know that, right?

10:27.680 --> 10:30.320
Why would Matthew steal a key card
from a Premier Lodge?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.840
Ask him.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.800
We can't.
We can't find him.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.400
You can't find him, why?

10:37.480 --> 10:39.080
What has happened?
Where is he?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.320
The key card.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.840
He's just saving money.
You know, when he's...

10:45.920 --> 10:48.800
Instead of sleeping...
in a cheap hotel

10:48.880 --> 10:50.640
when he's working out of town,
he sleeps in his car,

10:50.720 --> 10:53.680
and then he sneaks in
to use their bathroom in the morning.

10:54.680 --> 10:55.720
Why?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.200
Thank you.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.080
Why

11:03.920 --> 11:05.760
Come on.
Where is Matthew?

11:11.880 --> 11:12.880
Mrs Gibson?

11:14.080 --> 11:15.360
Thank you, Jessica.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.800
I thought you were supposed
to go through the lawyers in future.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.520
They can't help me with this.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.000
Who is that?

11:23.800 --> 11:26.480
-I don't know.
-He was at your daughter's funeral.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.360
We had a photographer there. Yes, he was there to meet Jason.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.840
He's an informant of some kind.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.400
Might work at Daughtons. Daughtons

11:37.000 --> 11:41.360
It's a company we rely on
for information about our competitors.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.160
Entirely legally.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.480
Daughtons. Thank you.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.280
I see the police were here again.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.200
Who was that man
you spoke to at the funeral?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.960
Oh, I told you, an informant.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.440
And he works for Daughtons?

12:20.520 --> 12:22.000
Yes. Stuart Callaghan.

12:23.640 --> 12:26.520
He was responsible for the information
we got on Andrew Barnes.

12:29.400 --> 12:34.400
If there's anything you should tell me,
do it now.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.960
What could that be?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.400
Something's not right.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.560
What?

12:55.360 --> 12:58.880
Something's not right.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.120
You said the Four Spades shut at 11:00.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.280
Yes.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.280
Well, Henry Gibson's phone was there
until ten to 12:00 that night.

13:08.360 --> 13:11.200
-I know. It's weird.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.240
You're welcome.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.920
<i>Are you absolutely sure he was here?</i>

13:23.000 --> 13:24.800
Yeah, yeah, he was here.
He comes here quite a lot.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.120
And what time did you close that night?

13:26.200 --> 13:29.040
11:00. It was the first week
of our new opening hours.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.120
Are you sure you can't have
made a mistake about the date?

13:31.200 --> 13:33.280
No, I remember 'cause
we had a burglary later that night.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.800
-Or vandals more like.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.320
Well, me window got smashed.
Nothing got stolen, but, er,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.480
the alarm went off
a little before 12:00.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.800
-Yeah, about that.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.960
Thank you.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.800
So you're saying
he broke in and got his phone.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.000
Yes. He went to Grace's, came back,

13:52.080 --> 13:54.440
expecting the pub to be open
until its usual 1:00 a.m.,

13:54.520 --> 13:55.520
but it was closed at 11:00.

13:58.320 --> 14:02.800
Laura, he left his phone in the pub
so he'd have an alibi if we traced it.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.560
Well, can we go after him now?

14:04.640 --> 14:05.840
This is Rav's investigation.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.520
He doesn't want to pursue this,
I can't make him.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.480
-Yes, you can.
-But I won't.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.040
It's not enough.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.640
I need your help.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.160
And why should I help you?
We're nothing.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.160
Because I'm still investigating
the murder of your girlfriend.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
Are you free?

14:46.280 --> 14:49.960
Sylvie wanted to see us about something,
a new development.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.320
The... Grace Tower?

14:53.160 --> 14:55.560
-Yeah, in a year or two, maybe.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.000
It's, erm...

14:58.720 --> 15:00.160
We're very excited about it.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.920
We're supposed to meet her
in the restaurant.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.720
Oh.

15:04.800 --> 15:05.960
Okay.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.960
You want to see these?
No.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.080
Sylvie loves it.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.920
Of course she loved it.
She loves Grace.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.200
Sorry, what's that supposed to mean?

15:46.360 --> 15:49.240
Change the name of that development
and you'll find out.

15:59.320 --> 16:00.760
Sorry, where is Sylvie?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.080
-I'll give her a call.
-Do it.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.280
-No answer.
-Okay, well, she knows where to find me.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.440
Er...

16:31.960 --> 16:33.120
Shit.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.080
Come on, come on!

17:33.280 --> 17:35.040
You wanted to see me?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.760
Yes, erm...

17:38.840 --> 17:42.880
We've been thinking about
the Andrew Barnes situation.

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
Yes?

17:44.680 --> 17:46.840
Well, with all the police interest...

17:48.080 --> 17:51.200
we need to distance ourselves
from you for a while.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.120
You know that's like saying
you think I'm guilty, right?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.680
We've discussed it.
It's what's best for the company.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.880
-Don't take this personally.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.200
Do you know how I found out
about the Lambeth problems?

18:09.280 --> 18:10.440
Jason...

18:10.520 --> 18:15.520
I found him crying on Grace's bed,
hugging one of her dresses.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.120
So I blackmailed him.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.440
Maybe I'm not the only person
you should distance yourself from.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.080
Have you got a minute?

18:41.160 --> 18:42.800
Now is not a good time.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.280
Well, I've got a theory.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.760
I think you went to Daughtons
to get dirt on Andrew Barnes.

18:46.840 --> 18:50.280
But you didn't get any, so then
you paid this man, Stuart Callaghan,

18:50.360 --> 18:53.000
ex-military, dodgy character, to kill him.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.080
Now, Callaghan's tenant, Bendek Krol,
well, he finds out about it somehow,

18:58.160 --> 19:02.080
he tries to squeeze you, or both of you,
with money, but...

19:03.080 --> 19:05.880
then he dies in an autoerotic accident.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.800
Or what seems to be
an autoerotic accident.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.000
Are you out of your fucking mind?

19:09.080 --> 19:11.280
No, I'm just telling you which way
the evidence is pointing.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.360
No, you're not.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.280
Because if it was pointing anywhere,
we wouldn't be here.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.840
That's is speculation
and verging on harassment.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.200
You remember saying
it was all about Marcella?

19:21.320 --> 19:23.840
-If it was, it's not, any longer.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.720
I'm just saying,
if there ever was a competition.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.920
I think I won it, last night.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.000
What are you looking at?

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
What are you doing?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.080
Have you got anything?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.040
There must have been something on there.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.840
It's nothing you're going to like.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.240
I started with the diary you downloaded.

20:00.320 --> 20:01.320
See for yourself,

20:01.400 --> 20:04.840
but if he was at all the places listed,
that pretty much rules him out.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.440
Hmm.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.240
That's not his.
That's Matthew's diary.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.680
Henry knew exactly
when he was out of town.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.960
-I'm telling you, he's framing him.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.840
-Sorry, I've got to get this.
-Yeah, go on.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.160
Thank you.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.880
-Hello.

20:30.960 --> 20:31.960
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

20:32.040 --> 20:33.560
<i>Tim! Did you sleep with him?</i>

20:33.640 --> 20:36.000
What? That's none of your business.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.040
Oh, fuck!
You did, didn't you?

20:39.720 --> 20:41.000
Now why are you fucking
looking into Henry?

20:41.080 --> 20:42.120
<i>Now don't lie to me, Marcella.</i>

20:42.200 --> 20:44.280
-You know that I can't tell you that.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.480
-Jason--
<i></i>

20:46.560 --> 20:48.760
<i></i>

20:48.840 --> 20:50.920
If you think he killed Grace,
why haven't you arrested him?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Why is he still out there?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.720
Because we haven't
got enough on him yet.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.120
Well, I'll get you enough.
I'll get you a fucking confession!

20:57.440 --> 20:58.840
-Shit!

21:49.600 --> 21:52.600
Jason, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing here?

21:52.680 --> 21:54.560
-You killed her!

22:21.160 --> 22:22.440
Oh, God!

22:22.520 --> 22:23.560
Jason?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.440
Jason!

22:40.840 --> 22:41.840
Jason?

22:42.680 --> 22:44.600
It's okay, it's all right.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.360
-Jason, look at me.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.680
Look at me.
It's going to be okay.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.280
-Oh, God.
It was self-defence.

22:53.560 --> 22:55.240
Put the knife down.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.680
Put the knife.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.400
I thought...
I thought he was a burglar.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.600
So, what are you gonna
do about me... huh?

23:02.680 --> 23:03.920
Nothing.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.840
So why don't you drop the knife?

23:08.960 --> 23:10.120
Don't.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.120
All right. All right.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.880
Come on, you're not very good
at improvising, are you?

23:19.960 --> 23:21.120
It's not your strong suit.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.560
-I'm talking about May.

23:24.480 --> 23:25.560
What are you gonna do?

23:26.600 --> 23:28.800
Are you going to kill me
and try to pin it on Matthew?

23:29.960 --> 23:32.080
Who... who's May?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.960
It was a good plan.

23:34.040 --> 23:37.320
It was a great plan
until someone moved the body and...

23:37.400 --> 23:38.840
fucked it all up.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.680
See, I know who did that.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.120
I know who moved Grace's body.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.720
It was a perfect plan.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.480
Oh, no. Oh!

26:01.280 --> 26:04.320
You are so screwed.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.480
You are so screwed.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.160
Jason?

26:15.840 --> 26:19.800
Jason? Oh, Jason, baby, it's okay.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.680
Jason?

26:22.760 --> 26:24.680
It's okay, it's okay, baby.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.680
This is Marcella Backland requesting
urgent backup and an ambulance.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.080
...police officer.
I was attacked in my own home...

26:44.160 --> 26:46.480
Mr Gibson,
we'll see you at the police station, okay?

26:46.560 --> 26:48.720
-Just calm down.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.720
Hitting him

26:53.800 --> 26:56.520
-He's lying.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.880
You just compromised
the entire investigation.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.520
He confessed, Laura.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.480
All you had was circumstantial
and it still is.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.960
We've got nothing to charge him with.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.080
-We have. He stabbed Jason!
-Go home.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.680
-We'll talk about this tomorrow.
-No.

27:06.760 --> 27:07.880
Go home.

27:10.720 --> 27:14.520
You've got to question him about the pub.
It doesn't add up, Laura.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.200
I know it's him!

27:56.920 --> 28:00.120
You do realise that
they broke into my house?

28:00.200 --> 28:01.920
Right? Both of them.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.120
This was... this was self-defence.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.960
Okay, Henry,
so tell us what happened.

28:06.040 --> 28:07.760
I was in my wine cellar, cleaning up.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.840
One of the shelves
had fallen down.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.680
Yeah, we noticed that.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.400
And I heard glass shatter.

28:15.480 --> 28:17.000
-I get a knife.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.800
Because I was alone.
And because I was scared.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.000
Okay, so you took the knife
and then what happens?

28:22.080 --> 28:26.280
I go upstairs
and he came at me from behind.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.120
I turned, and I...
I mean, I...

28:29.200 --> 28:31.920
I had no idea that it was Jason.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.840
I mean,
what the fuck was he doing there?

28:33.920 --> 28:35.080
Alex...

28:39.960 --> 28:43.880
So, Henry,
you stabbed him in the stomach.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.960
Twice.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.440
Now, I find it very hard to believe
that you didn't recognise him.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.320
It was just instinct.
It happened so fast.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.400
The night your half-sister was murdered,
were you at a pub?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.280
So what is happening
with Marcella Backland, please?

28:57.360 --> 28:59.280
We understand
the seriousness of the allegations.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.360
We're looking into it.

29:00.440 --> 29:04.560
Do you? She broke into my house.
She assaulted me in my own home.

29:04.640 --> 29:08.080
She put a plastic bag
over my head in the same...

29:08.160 --> 29:09.600
As I said, we're looking into it.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.800
So, the pub?

29:13.880 --> 29:15.320
Yes, I was at the Four Spades.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.640
Well, it closed at 11:00,

29:16.720 --> 29:18.880
but we traced your phone there
until ten to 12:00.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.320
Why are you asking my client about this?

29:21.400 --> 29:23.240
No, no, that's okay.

29:23.320 --> 29:27.520
The phone was in my car
which was parked right next to the pub.

29:27.600 --> 29:32.000
I don't know, maybe your tracing equipment
is not pin

29:33.200 --> 29:35.240
Okay, so going back to the house.

29:35.320 --> 29:40.440
Right, so I'm going to call an ambulance
and then she comes in and she attacks me.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.360
Is she--

29:46.440 --> 29:48.480
Not on this case, no.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.240
But she is still a police officer?

29:50.320 --> 29:51.440
Yes, I am.
Yes.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.600
After she tried to kill me?

29:52.680 --> 29:54.360
And we don't yet know
what occurred at your house.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.080
Jason Backland
and Marcella Backland assaulted me!

29:57.160 --> 29:58.960
That is what happened in my house.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.000
I mean,
she's clearly out of her bloody mind!

30:01.080 --> 30:04.760
Would you mind telling me
where you were on these dates?

30:04.840 --> 30:07.800
Oh, no.
No. Of course not.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.160
He's made sure he has alibis.
We've got to find new evidence.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.640
You're not meant to be here.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.360
What, you think you can do
better off without me?

30:21.440 --> 30:23.360
-It's not that, Marcella.
-Good.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.600
<i>It was a perfect plan.</i>

31:06.240 --> 31:08.840
Hi. I heard about Jason,
are you okay?

31:08.920 --> 31:11.360
-Yeah, I'm fine. Erm...

31:11.440 --> 31:13.000
He's fine, he'll be out of surgery soon.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.000
Did you, erm...

31:15.080 --> 31:16.760
Did you tell him about us?

31:16.840 --> 31:18.400
No, no, of course not.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.680
Well, he called and asked
if we were sleeping together.
-I don't know.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.240
I mean,
he's been pretty jealous

31:24.320 --> 31:26.480
since that night
when he saw me over at your house.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.200
Every time we talk,
he brings it up.

31:28.280 --> 31:29.360
Did he do that?

31:29.440 --> 31:30.920
Oh, erm, no.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.520
Wife beater tried picking
on someone his own size.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.720
What do you and Jason talk about?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.800
Take a look at this
when you get a moment.

31:48.800 --> 31:49.920
Hey, Marcella...

31:55.600 --> 31:57.240
You had Matthew Neil's diary
on your computer.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.880
How did you get hold of the contents
of my client's computer?

31:59.960 --> 32:03.240
Marcella Backland
broke into my office and stole it.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.320
Actually, yes,
I got Matthew a job at DTG.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.840
Therefore, it's very useful for me
to know when he's away.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.080
Where is Matthew?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.440
You thought France
if I remember correctly.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.480
-Let's take a break.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.080
What is the problem with...

32:20.440 --> 32:22.760
Marcella, you really messed up.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.120
Everything's ruined.
He's gonna get bail.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.040
What do you mean he's gonna get bail?
He stabbed Jason.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.640
Yeah, and when we check the phone records,

32:28.720 --> 32:32.040
we're going to see that you spoke to Jason
right before he got there, aren't we?

32:32.120 --> 32:34.640
There's evidence of two break-ins
at Henry's house

32:34.720 --> 32:36.480
-and he's clearly been assaulted.
-I don't believe this.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.480
You stole information from his office.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.680
-It's him! He confessed!
-It doesn't matter!

32:41.760 --> 32:43.840
He looks like the victim
of a personal vendetta.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.360
He's gonna get bail.

32:45.440 --> 32:48.280
-Oh. No, you've got to give me 24 hours.
-You're not even on this case.

32:48.360 --> 32:51.040
Twelve. Give me 12 hours,
Laura, please.

32:55.560 --> 32:58.560
You've got until tomorrow morning.
Then we've got to let him go.

33:30.840 --> 33:34.800
<i>No, don't think so.</i>
<i>But you can ask someone in a half an hour.</i>

33:36.320 --> 33:37.760
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

33:37.840 --> 33:39.400
<i>Weird.</i>

33:39.480 --> 33:41.680
<i>Well... want a drink?</i>

33:41.760 --> 33:43.120
Coffee.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.520
-Thanks.
-Okay.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.720
Look, you were right,
all his alibis hold up.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.080
Of course they do.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.880
<i>They haven't got much longer.</i>

35:55.800 --> 35:56.960
Thank you.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.800
-I want to see your shoulder.
Marcella.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.680
Sorry...
She's not allowed to be in here.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.440
Show me your fucking shoulder!
I want to see his shoulder!

36:05.520 --> 36:07.880
I have to insist on her removal.
Calm down!

36:07.960 --> 36:09.440
-Absolutely.
Stop it!

36:09.520 --> 36:12.200
Calm down, Marcella!
Calm down!

36:15.600 --> 36:18.240
-And we will be leaving.
-You know. You fucking know!

36:18.320 --> 36:19.520
Think she should
still be a police officer? -No, Mr Gibson.
Now, hold on...

36:20.880 --> 36:22.240
No! Rav.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.480
What? You are kidding me.
This is ridiculous.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.560
-Emma, could you possibly...

36:26.640 --> 36:28.440
-Get the hell off me!
-Just show me your...

36:30.760 --> 36:34.080
You are not listening to a mad woman!
A vicious monster!

36:34.160 --> 36:35.560
Emma, do something!

36:49.680 --> 36:50.800
May bit him.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.840
She was missing a front tooth,
and she had a crooked molar.

36:57.680 --> 36:59.640
-She bit him.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.320
Grace is the only person
connected to you.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.600
So she was the real target.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.960
But you had
to kill seven innocent people

37:55.040 --> 37:56.680
to conceal that fact.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.800
Where is he?
Where's Matthew?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.720
He's on my boat
in the South Dock Marina.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.200
Is he alive?

38:08.800 --> 38:09.960
Of course.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.800
He's my best friend.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.360
Why him?

38:15.440 --> 38:18.560
He's the only person
I know well enough to frame.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.560
And you couldn't kill him, could you?

38:23.840 --> 38:26.840
But you could kill a six-year-old child,
couldn't you?

38:26.920 --> 38:28.000
You could kill a six-year-old girl.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.320
I was not planning to do that.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.880
In fact, I was trying to find any way
I could to avoid doing that,

38:32.960 --> 38:35.080
but then she bit me, and...

38:37.800 --> 38:39.120
I snapped.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.440
I'm genuinely really very sorry
about that.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.320
I don't believe you.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.560
I think you killed all of them easily.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.120
It's not easy.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.720
The first one, Carol Fincher, I...

39:05.320 --> 39:07.160
almost couldn't do it.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.280
But it's all about crossing that line.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.640
Well, you know.

39:48.080 --> 39:51.320
We found Matthew...
and released Yann.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.840
We got him, Marcella.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.400
Hmm, but at what cost?

40:01.400 --> 40:03.280
I don't know what I've become.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.600
I was a married, stay-at-home mum,
and now...

40:22.880 --> 40:26.040
Am I ever going to know
what happened at Henry Gibson's house?

40:28.520 --> 40:30.120
Not at any of the houses.

41:04.160 --> 41:06.720
This is the last time that you'll see us.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.800
Wasn't Grace's fault, you know...

41:09.640 --> 41:11.920
that you couldn't see anybody else.

41:13.480 --> 41:16.160
You know why I came back, hmm?

41:17.480 --> 41:19.960
I just wanted to be part of something.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.840
A family, a business, just...

41:24.160 --> 41:25.440
something.

41:26.520 --> 41:28.600
But you couldn't do it, could you?

41:30.400 --> 41:32.120
You could never let me in.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.200
You couldn't let me in...

41:37.000 --> 41:38.040
until I killed her.

41:38.120 --> 41:42.200
Shut up, Henry.
We're not interested in you passing blame.

41:42.280 --> 41:47.560
We're here to tell you that one day,
tomorrow, next week, next year...

41:48.800 --> 41:50.600
you're going to die.

41:54.960 --> 41:58.040
And it will happen so slowly...

41:58.120 --> 42:03.240
that you'll have time to realise
that we were the ones that did it.

42:36.600 --> 42:37.880
Hi.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.280
Did you read the material I gave you?

42:48.200 --> 42:49.320
Yep.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.520
-I expected to hear from you.
-Well, I thought it was a joke.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.000
You honestly think
Jason has killed someone?

42:56.080 --> 42:58.000
Paid to get someone killed.
Yeah.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.560
And I was hoping that
you would help me prove it.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.200
Well, that's not going to happen.

43:03.280 --> 43:05.120
What did you expect?
We nearly lost him.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.200
You know, I read the transcripts
from Henry Gibson's interviews.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.600
He confessed to everything, didn't he?

43:15.920 --> 43:18.960
Except he never confessed
to moving his sister's body.

43:19.960 --> 43:24.760
And then I remembered Laura saying
that you watched the CCTV

43:24.840 --> 43:25.960
from outside Grace's house...

43:26.920 --> 43:28.720
before her body was found.

43:43.080 --> 43:47.200
That's you leaving Grace Gibson's house
on the night of the murder.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.080
It's nicely edited out
in the working copy,

43:50.160 --> 43:52.360
but that's from the original.

43:54.120 --> 43:58.120
Now, I can... erase that altogether...

44:00.360 --> 44:01.600
or not.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.960
You do what you think's right.

44:08.760 --> 44:09.760
Marcella?

44:11.600 --> 44:13.000
Marcella.
