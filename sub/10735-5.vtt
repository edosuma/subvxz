<b>1x15 - Malefactor</b>

00:02.810 --> 00:05.312
The Olde Belwood Days
festival is the first personal

00:05.380 --> 00:07.681
appearance I've done in months.

00:07.749 --> 00:10.684
I can't find my name on here anywhere.

00:10.752 --> 00:14.655
Ben, I know you are
famous through much of the universe,

00:14.656 --> 00:18.559
but it does not seem right for a
Plumber to seek personal celebrity.

00:18.475 --> 00:20.642
Rook, Plumber.
Ben, heroic dude.

00:20.710 --> 00:22.323
If people want to shower me with

00:22.358 --> 00:24.571
attention, who am I
to stand in their way?

00:24.640 --> 00:26.542
<i>Ben Tennyson.</i>

00:27.610 --> 00:30.159
Natalie Alvarez, deputy
director, Belwood parks and

00:30.195 --> 00:33.314
recreation, and the event
organizer for this little shindig.

00:33.349 --> 00:34.744
We spoke on the phone.

00:34.780 --> 00:38.133
I'm glad you and your sidekick
could join us here today.

00:38.169 --> 00:40.130
- Sidekick?
- I wanted to get

00:40.165 --> 00:42.396
Kangaroo commando for
this year's festival.

00:42.432 --> 00:45.861
But the kids were all
"Ben 10, Ben 10," don't you know?

00:45.896 --> 00:48.395
Oh, man. Kangaroo
commando would've been sweet!

00:48.431 --> 00:50.361
Oh, I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:50.397 --> 00:54.963
We're on a tight schedule,
so if you'll just follow me...

00:56.699 --> 01:00.997
- That, of course, is the bell.
- The bell?

01:01.032 --> 01:03.765
<i>The world's largest wooden
sleigh bell to commemorate</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:06.031
<i>the laplanders who
founded Belwood in 1638.</i>

01:06.100 --> 01:10.832
Hand-carved from solid walnut,
it weighs over 3,000 pounds.

01:10.867 --> 01:14.665
- Bell. Wood.
- So, Ms. Alvarez, I know

01:14.734 --> 01:18.533
it's probably just some huge
typo or something, but I can't

01:18.568 --> 01:20.201
seem to find my name on here.

01:20.237 --> 01:23.936
- Hmm? Oh, yes.
- I mean, it's kind of

01:23.971 --> 01:27.206
weird, since I'm the
guest of honor and all.

01:28.841 --> 01:31.640
There's got to be some
kind of mistake, lady.

01:31.676 --> 01:33.442
I'm Ben Tennyson, superhero.

01:33.477 --> 01:36.010
Saved the world, like, a billion times.

01:36.045 --> 01:38.745
And the kids want a chance to dunk you.

01:38.814 --> 01:41.480
All proceeds go to charity.
Thanks again.

01:41.515 --> 01:43.848
This is ridiculous.
I'm out of here.

01:43.883 --> 01:46.450
Whoa!

01:50.554 --> 01:52.688
It is for charity.

You're probably just some
loser in a cheap costume.

03:35.233 --> 03:39.335
Dude,
you just saw me transform.

03:39.403 --> 03:42.237
Lame. I'm out of here.

03:46.876 --> 03:50.411
Rook, where've you been?
I'm getting killed here.

03:50.479 --> 03:53.047
I was purchasing more tickets.

03:53.082 --> 03:56.783
- Seriously not cool, man.
- It is for a good cause.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.119
You already paid for the tickets.

03:59.154 --> 04:02.255
The charity still gets the money
even if you don't dunk me.

04:02.324 --> 04:03.957
But where is the fun in that?

04:11.732 --> 04:15.702
<i>The bell!
Save the bell!</i>

04:17.738 --> 04:19.769
I think I got its attention.

04:19.805 --> 04:22.973
Aw, man. I thought we
sent this puppy to the pound.

04:23.009 --> 04:24.175
You go find the huntsman.

04:24.243 --> 04:26.811
He's got to be around here
somewhere, controlling it.

04:26.846 --> 04:28.979
I'll teach this old dog some new tricks.

04:29.015 --> 04:32.683
This is no time to be
teaching tricks to a...

04:32.719 --> 04:35.786
I'm just going to assume from
now on that everything you ever

04:35.822 --> 04:38.924
say is just some weird expression.

04:39.559 --> 04:42.495
Hey, ugly. Over here.

04:44.264 --> 04:47.999
The bell!

04:48.034 --> 04:48.733
<i>Giant bell!</i>

04:48.801 --> 04:50.601
<i>- Look out!
- Run!</i>

04:52.138 --> 04:54.338
Oh, come on.
I have to save that kid?

04:54.373 --> 04:58.808
It would be so fitting if you
gave me Humungousaur.

04:58.844 --> 05:00.643
Heatblast?

05:06.050 --> 05:08.018
Whoa!

05:18.130 --> 05:20.196
Aw, man, that was a close ...

05:26.571 --> 05:31.542
Can't really fight fire with
fire in this case.

05:39.618 --> 05:42.236
You should've learned by now,

05:42.237 --> 05:44.855
no one gets the drop
on Khyber the Huntsman.

05:44.891 --> 05:47.291
There's a first time
for everything.

05:47.327 --> 05:49.594
This is between me and Tennyson.

05:49.662 --> 05:52.196
When you let your pet
run rampant, threatening

05:52.232 --> 05:54.866
innocent civilians,
I make it my concern.

05:58.338 --> 06:03.675
The bell!
Save the bell!

06:03.710 --> 06:07.045
Yeah, kind of busy right now.

06:10.117 --> 06:13.218
Now to really shake things up.

06:22.195 --> 06:23.966
Slamworm?

06:28.001 --> 06:30.135
<i>Rook, you've got to find Khyber.</i>

06:30.170 --> 06:34.705
<i>And make him stop whistling
commands at the dog.</i>

06:34.741 --> 06:38.878
Your partner's having
a little problem, is he?

06:40.913 --> 06:43.213
Khyber is not whistling.

06:43.249 --> 06:47.051
He has to be. His creature
is changing as fast as I ...

06:47.086 --> 06:50.955
- Save the bell!
- Lady, if it's okay

06:50.990 --> 06:54.224
with you, how about
I save the people from the bell.

07:13.142 --> 07:16.747
Hey, no snacking on the superhero.

07:19.816 --> 07:21.382
<i>Whoa!</i>

07:37.000 --> 07:40.302
This thing can instantly match
me, alien-for-alien now.

07:40.371 --> 07:44.306
But what about an alien
you've never seen before?

08:11.969 --> 08:15.371
Never thought I'd see
one of you guys again.

08:23.247 --> 08:27.150
<i>Whoa, the holographic
presidents' heads look totally real.</i>

08:27.218 --> 08:28.885
Yeah, you can hardly

08:28.954 --> 08:31.587
tell that some doofus
wrecked the real ones.

08:31.623 --> 08:32.755
Wasn't my fault.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.890
The Forever King stole the
sub-energy and ...

08:34.958 --> 08:38.260
And you turned into Upchuck
and belched away half a mountain.

08:38.328 --> 08:42.530
Not to mention a national
monument. Good job, hero.

08:42.599 --> 08:46.234
Is that what happened?
I thought you looked at it.

08:46.269 --> 08:48.169
That's enough, you two.

08:48.238 --> 08:50.672
<i>Mount Rushmore is a working
Plumber base now.</i>

08:50.707 --> 08:54.709
<i>So I want you both to
be on your best behavior.</i>

09:05.786 --> 09:08.888
You still haven't told us
what we're doing here, Grandpa.

09:08.957 --> 09:10.090
What's the big surprise?

09:10.125 --> 09:13.260
If I told you, it
wouldn't be a surprise.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.007
<i>Whoa.</i>

09:27.076 --> 09:30.911
So you're back in the Plumbing
business, huh, Grandpa?

09:30.947 --> 09:33.914
No way.
I'm strictly retired.

09:33.983 --> 09:39.821
M-Magister Tennyson, sir.
It's an honor.

09:39.889 --> 09:47.461
- As you were, Plumber.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

09:47.497 --> 09:51.466
- Magister? What's that?
- This way.

10:04.712 --> 10:08.446
There it is, kids.
A real, live Psycholeopteran.

10:08.482 --> 10:12.717
The Plumbers confiscated this one
from some interstellar smugglers.

10:12.752 --> 10:14.118
It's being kept here until it

10:14.154 --> 10:18.490
can be moved off-world
to a wildlife preserve.

10:21.962 --> 10:24.763
- Gross.
- Take a good look.

10:24.831 --> 10:28.633
They're almost extinct. This might
be your last chance to see one.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.135
I don't get it.

10:30.204 --> 10:33.038
Why would anybody smuggle
some big, ugly bug?

10:33.074 --> 10:37.042
- And what do I need thee glasses for?
- To hide your ugly face.

10:37.111 --> 10:40.045
- Pbht.
- Pbht.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.315
Psycholeopterans hunt by
hypnotizing their prey.

10:43.384 --> 10:45.752
Those patterns on their wings directly

10:45.753 --> 10:48.120
stimulate the reward
centers of the brain.

10:48.155 --> 10:49.855
Reward centers?

10:49.891 --> 10:53.192
So whatever you want most,
that's what you see?

10:53.228 --> 10:58.864
- Smart girl.
- So cool.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.133
- Ben.
- Whoa!

11:01.168 --> 11:03.235
And that's why people
smuggle them.

11:03.304 --> 11:08.473
- Staring at them is addictive.
- If they don't bite your face off.

11:08.509 --> 11:11.777
That... was... awesome!

11:11.846 --> 11:14.413
I was the most famous
superhero in the universe.

11:14.482 --> 11:16.950
There were people cheering
wherever I went.

11:16.985 --> 11:20.319
That's what you want most?
Lame.

11:20.355 --> 11:22.689
And you had to clean my room.

11:22.757 --> 11:24.524
Keep dreaming.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.227
Strange that it would go
after you, Ben.

11:27.262 --> 11:29.746
Psycholeopterans usually hunt creatures

11:29.747 --> 11:32.231
that can phase through solid matter.

11:32.267 --> 11:35.434
You mean Ectonurites,
like Ghostfreak?

11:35.503 --> 11:38.437
Close.
They're called Necrofriggians.

11:38.473 --> 11:41.108
<i>Red alert!
Security breach at main entrance.</i>

11:41.743 --> 11:44.310
<i>Red alert.
Security breach at main entrance.</i>

11:44.346 --> 11:46.980
You kids stay here while
I check this out.

11:48.116 --> 11:51.518
No way.
Red alert means hero time.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.058
Awesome!
What do you think it is?

11:58.094 --> 12:00.628
Giant robot?
Monster-tentacle thing?

12:00.696 --> 12:07.803
Big trouble if Grandpa
Max catches us.

12:08.705 --> 12:14.009
Malware.
What's he doing here?

12:14.077 --> 12:15.643
- What?
- Huh?

12:15.679 --> 12:18.446
Mine.

12:25.322 --> 12:27.288
Don't.
Grandpa Max said ...

12:27.324 --> 12:30.559
Let Malware destroy the
whole base and everyone in it?

12:30.594 --> 12:33.629
I don't think so.
It's hero time.

12:35.599 --> 12:39.535
Ben, no!

12:39.570 --> 12:44.274
Forcis nebuli!

12:44.342 --> 12:47.710
Ben Tennyson,
the bane of very existence.

12:47.746 --> 12:50.481
I should've known you'd be here.

12:51.516 --> 12:54.356
What can I say?
I get around.

12:59.391 --> 13:01.358
That's it, Ben.
Keep him busy.

13:01.393 --> 13:03.193
Is that the best you can do?

13:03.262 --> 13:06.765
Wow, dude, you really are defective.

13:10.202 --> 13:16.473
I am superior.

13:16.541 --> 13:22.045
- Ben, are you okay?
- Okay?

13:22.114 --> 13:24.181
I am awesome!
Whoo-hoo!

13:24.216 --> 13:27.017
Another victory for team Tennyson.

13:27.052 --> 13:29.752
The tachyon cannon is a
weapon of last resort.

13:29.821 --> 13:33.223
It keys into the target's
biosignature, then disrupts

13:33.291 --> 13:35.959
every individual
cell with matching DNA.

13:36.028 --> 13:39.095
<i>It took Malware apart
on a subcellular level.</i>

13:40.766 --> 13:46.970
<i>You'd like to think that,
wouldn't you?</i>

13:47.005 --> 13:51.574
<i>Too slow, old man.
It's mine now.</i>

13:51.610 --> 13:53.476
What a shame your weapon

13:53.512 --> 13:58.516
couldn't properly disrupt my
mutated genetic code.

13:58.551 --> 14:02.587
I wonder what effect it will
have on human DNA.

14:02.623 --> 14:05.694
Let's find out, shall we?

14:19.826 --> 14:24.528
Don't do this, Malware.
Human DNA has less than 1% variation.

14:24.563 --> 14:28.531
You could wipe out every human
within 100 miles, maybe more.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.071
A bonus.

14:35.107 --> 14:40.243
Now how'd you like a little feedback?

14:57.395 --> 14:59.562
You insolent brat!

14:59.597 --> 15:02.732
You...
also something bad.

15:02.767 --> 15:06.302
But what's this? Tennyson
once again gets the upper hand.

15:06.338 --> 15:09.440
He goes in for the winning move.

15:12.444 --> 15:16.179
I'd like nothing better than to
drain you to an empty shell.

15:16.214 --> 15:19.582
But I've gotten what I came for.
You've already lost,

15:19.618 --> 15:22.952
Ben Tennyson, and you
don't even know it.

15:27.959 --> 15:31.027
Aw, I was all ready to
blast him into atoms.

15:31.096 --> 15:34.830
He said he got what he
came for. That big alien gun?

15:34.865 --> 15:38.033
There are easier
ways to get a tachyon cannon.

15:38.102 --> 15:41.670
It had to be something
he could only get here.

15:48.043 --> 15:49.877
Phew.
It's still here.

15:49.946 --> 15:54.849
But Malware or someone who
works for him was here, too. Look.

15:57.121 --> 15:58.587
Why would someone sneak

15:58.622 --> 16:02.324
in to grab the galaxy's rarest
creature but then just leave it?

16:02.393 --> 16:06.061
He didn't.
He said he had what he came for.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.414
But what?

16:08.415 --> 16:11.943
<i>Khyber and his buddies have been</i>

16:12.344 --> 16:15.972
collecting alien predator
DNA for the last five years.

16:24.049 --> 16:27.251
But if this is
about taking me out, how come

16:27.287 --> 16:29.421
Khyber isn't here for his big moment?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.724
He wouldn't let his
dog hog all the glory.

16:52.712 --> 16:56.982
Splat like a bug on a windshield.

16:57.050 --> 17:00.719
Duh. Of course it can
go intangible, too.

17:00.788 --> 17:03.822
It's my... natural...
predator.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.261
<i> Ben! Ben!</i>

17:08.296 --> 17:10.896
<i>Ben! Ben!
We love you, Ben!</i>

17:10.933 --> 17:15.068
<i>Yeah! Thank you.
I love you all, too.</i>

17:15.103 --> 17:18.105
<i>But not as much as you love me.</i>

17:19.140 --> 17:27.378
No. This isn't
what it's about. I'm a hero.

17:27.448 --> 17:29.647
<i>Being a hero isn't about fame.</i>

17:29.716 --> 17:33.385
<i>It's about putting other people
before yourself or what you want.</i>

17:33.453 --> 17:36.183
<i>It's about doing the right thing
just because it's </i>

17:36.273 --> 17:41.161
<i>the right thing to do.
It's about making a difference.</i>

17:46.166 --> 17:47.032
<i>Whoa!</i>

17:56.609 --> 18:01.647
Dude, are you ever gonna fight
or just keep wasting my time?

18:01.683 --> 18:05.854
Or maybe you are
just wasting my time...

18:16.599 --> 18:20.001
<i>Rook, I think this is all just
a diversion to keep us busy.</i>

18:20.036 --> 18:22.504
<i>He's after something else here.</i>

18:22.539 --> 18:26.675
Smart boy.
And with that, we're done.

18:26.744 --> 18:29.512
Oh, you've got bigger
fish to fry, my friend.

18:29.580 --> 18:32.514
You might start at your
quaint little Plumber craft.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.418
Why would you tell me
what you are after?

18:35.486 --> 18:38.688
I have my reasons.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.861
<i>Ben! It is my truck!</i>

18:59.777 --> 19:03.346
No.

19:03.381 --> 19:06.048
You can't be here.
It's not possible.

19:06.084 --> 19:08.684
Come now, Ben Tennyson.

19:08.720 --> 19:12.422
You didn't think a child could
get rid of me that easily, did you?

19:12.490 --> 19:15.224
Stay away from me.
I'm warning you.

19:15.260 --> 19:18.428
You're warning me?

19:18.497 --> 19:22.365
No, I'm warning you.
Do not try to follow me.

19:22.434 --> 19:24.767
You know what I'm capable of.

19:24.803 --> 19:27.440
<i>Ben!</i>

19:30.475 --> 19:33.076
Check inside.
He took something.

19:33.145 --> 19:37.281
I'm going to stop Malware...
once and for all.

19:46.526 --> 19:48.158
I told you to stay put.

19:48.194 --> 19:51.428
I was never
very good at following orders.

20:10.114 --> 20:15.118
<i>Your choice, hero.
Me or the little ones down there?</i>

20:15.153 --> 20:16.753
Coward.

20:28.967 --> 20:30.934
You kids okay?

20:38.342 --> 20:41.278
- What did he take?
- Difficult to determine.

20:41.313 --> 20:43.480
He did not take any
weapons or equipment.

20:43.549 --> 20:46.583
But a section of the main memory
core was destroyed, along with

20:46.652 --> 20:48.586
some of the auxiliary power systems.

20:48.621 --> 20:51.756
You're lucky he didn't
turn your whole truck into dust.

20:51.791 --> 20:55.226
Who is this Malware?
I would check his Plumber file, but...

20:55.261 --> 20:57.862
Short answer ...
he's a Galvanic mechamorph

20:57.863 --> 21:00.464
and a total psychopath.
Long answer ...

21:00.500 --> 21:04.002
<i>He, um, I was being kind of a jerk to</i>

21:04.003 --> 21:07.505
you before, but you
saved my life anyways.

21:07.541 --> 21:11.765
I, um, I just want to say, you know...

21:11.766 --> 21:13.878
thanks and stuff.

21:13.947 --> 21:16.751
Don't mention it.
It's what I do.

21:19.786 --> 21:24.322
Mr. Tennyson, I can't thank you
enough for what you've done here today.

21:24.357 --> 21:27.025
I guess I made the
right choice after all.

21:27.061 --> 21:30.062
Me too.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have

21:30.097 --> 21:33.131
to give the people what they want.

21:33.167 --> 21:38.439
All right, folks, who wants to try
and dunk Four Arms? Step right up.

21:41.475 --> 21:44.509
Anybody?
Anyone at all?
