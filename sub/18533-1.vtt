01:35.840 --> 01:37.671
Stop the car, Chad!
I need to get out!

01:37.760 --> 01:39.696
- You all right, Norm?
- You said we were going home!

01:39.720 --> 01:41.438
I'm in fucking pain, Chad, please!

01:41.520 --> 01:42.839
Catch this fucker

01:45.120 --> 01:46.599
Down there! Down there!

01:56.040 --> 01:58.759
It's burning!
It's not fucking funny!

01:58.840 --> 02:00.671
Shut up, Norman.
You're putting the dog off.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.751
Fuck the dog!

02:02.840 --> 02:04.296
- Give it some, Chad.
- Yeah.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.515
- Come on, Ty. Yeah!
- That's it, Ty!

02:06.600 --> 02:09.068
- He can't drive!
- Keep her straight, mush.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.230
I think I'm gonna die!

02:17.640 --> 02:18.709
Broadside it!

02:18.800 --> 02:20.760
That's it, Ty.
Kick the back end out, mush.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.273

02:25.360 --> 02:27.396
That's it! That's it, Ty!

02:30.440 --> 02:31.873
That was mint, mate.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.136
I mean it, I'm having you, Tyson.
I'm fucking having you!

02:34.160 --> 02:36.276
- Get it!
- Down there, down there!

02:39.960 --> 02:42.315
Fuck's sake, Norman!
You made me fucking crash.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.153
- Up yours, Tyson.
- All right, let's have a look at you.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.512
Good little bitch, ain't you?
Gotta get you fit, though.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.994
What's up, Norm?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.911
Don't fucking touch me, Chad!

02:57.000 --> 03:00.072
- It's all right. It's only a poxy cut.
- It's fucking broke, innit?

03:00.200 --> 03:02.416
Well, what you doing
falling out the car, then, you dinny?

03:02.440 --> 03:05.591
- Got pushed, didn't I?
- Shut up, Norman, you little snout.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.272
I swear
on the mother's cunt, Chad.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.589
Come on, let's gel.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.839
Fuck off!

03:55.280 --> 03:56.713
Have that.

03:59.760 --> 04:02.149
Oi!

04:02.240 --> 04:04.231
Not over there, you div!

04:04.320 --> 04:07.437
Right, tens on the gavva's nose.

04:11.480 --> 04:15.189
One fucking go, I said.
Right, my turn.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.159
Yeah, take a load of that.

04:18.240 --> 04:21.277
Right, that's it. Tens each.
Come on, ten.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.351
- I weren't playin' in that one.
- Yes, you were.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.510
- All right, once more?
- It's now 30.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Have that.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.616
You fat joey.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.278
Fuck's sake, Norman.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.736
- It's well gammy, Kel.
- Gammy dodger more like.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.149
All right, maggot?

04:41.240 --> 04:42.856
I think
it's definitely fractious.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.871
All right?

04:44.960 --> 04:47.110
Stop your flapping, Norman!

04:47.200 --> 04:49.430
I'm not looking after you
like this, no way.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.192
You're meant to be working for me.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.555
He's broken his leg,
you have, Chad.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.518
- I've gotta go to hospital, Kel.
- You know you can't do that.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.352
Hypochondrio.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.954
Ain't much use now 'round here,
are you, you dinny?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.473
Hardly a joey now.

05:03.560 --> 05:05.437
Do you want me
to get you some painkillers?

05:05.520 --> 05:09.274
Oi, Chad, you've seriously
gone and broke his leg now.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.157
Weren't me, love.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.798
Fucking goat, Chad.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.156
You know you've gotta keep him
out the trailer, Mini.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.718
Make us a cup of tea, then, Kel.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.159
You do it.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.471
And make sure Tyson
does his schoolwork.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.471
Where are you going?

05:27.560 --> 05:31.030
Told you, I'm taking Mini
to the pet shop.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.315
- She wants a terrapin.
- Terra fucking who?

05:33.400 --> 05:35.072
Turtles, Dad.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.831

05:41.120 --> 05:43.111
Always wedging me, ent she, Ty?

05:45.800 --> 05:48.030
Give us a kiss.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.674

- Gel on.

05:56.680 --> 06:00.036
Make your dad a tea, then.
All right, Ty, where you going?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.030
You got tiddles? Go on.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.475

06:08.560 --> 06:10.516
- Where d'you think you're going?
- To the dog.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.517
- Ain't you got homeworks?
- No.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.995
You never had to do homework.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.877
I never went to school.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.396
Yeah, and look at you now!
Let him go play.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.676
Go on, then, son.
Piss off.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.748
Make us a tea, then.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.077
Got something to show you.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.390
About what?

06:47.480 --> 06:49.471
We're gonna protest
about your brother.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.992
Huh? Huh?

07:15.120 --> 07:17.953
Tyson. Tyson!

07:21.080 --> 07:22.308
Knobhead!

07:23.320 --> 07:25.356
Bennett!

07:25.440 --> 07:26.668
Bennett!

07:33.720 --> 07:35.472
Bennett!

07:39.640 --> 07:41.358
Go get the paint
you chored, mush.

07:41.480 --> 07:44.392
Get some fucking clothes on
whilst you're at it.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.074
Your joey's
a fucking animal, Colby.

07:47.160 --> 07:49.549
So what's the plan with the motor?

07:49.640 --> 07:51.915
Gonna make a complaint for Bryan.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.878
Too late for him, mush.
Ten's a ten.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.359
I ain't having it.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.908
Can't. He were innocence.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.395
Besides, he's your brother.
He don't like prison.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.755
Well, this ain't gonna
get him out, is it?

08:03.840 --> 08:06.513
Just you wait
'till it's your turn.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.397
Water.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.550
Water, doggy.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.876
I got some brushes for you, Chaddy.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.880
What d'you want me
to do with them?

08:26.920 --> 08:29.195
Well, you're the artist, Chad.
You tell me.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.513
You need a window, Chad.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.750
Worzel here can sort that out.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.988
Fuck happened? Mush?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.354
What is it?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.280
What have I done now, eh?

08:50.320 --> 08:53.471
Let's look at you.
Let's look at you.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.835
- What happened, mush?
- Dog's dead.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.718
- What do you mean, the dog's dead?
- Dog's dead, Dad.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.552
Worzel's fire exploded.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.108
- What the fuck?
- Don't ask me, Chad.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.760
You could have killed Tyson,
you dumb gummidgey fuck!

09:05.840 --> 09:07.159
He's gotta go, Col.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.640
I don't care if he's a jubby dinlo.
He's a fucking liability.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.517
What do you want me
to do 'bout it?

09:11.600 --> 09:14.273
- He's gonna kill one of the kids.
- Don't be a fanny, Chad.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.793
There's nothing fanny about it.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.677
All right, calm down, calm down.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.671
All right, Tyson?
Cushty, son?

09:19.760 --> 09:22.718
It's all right, mush, weren't your fault.
We'll get you a news one.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.233
You owe me a new dog, Worzel.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.072
Can I keep that one then, eh, Chad?

09:26.160 --> 09:29.709
You can fuckin' eat it for all I care.
I've had enough of his shit, Col.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.633
Blessed are the cracked, Chad.
Karl Marx said that.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.994
Karl fucking who?

09:51.080 --> 09:54.038
Can I cremate the dog,
then, eh, Col?

09:54.120 --> 09:55.439
Huh?

10:44.760 --> 10:47.718
You gonna sleep up there?

10:47.800 --> 10:49.199
No.

10:50.840 --> 10:55.436
Look, he were a good dog, mush.
But your dad'll get you another one.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.557
Come on,
let's go get some warm.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.952
That's them pills you're on, Les.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.634
I'm running 'round the fire, look.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.536
I'm going 'round and 'round.
I'm going 'round and 'round.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.518
'Round and 'round!

11:25.720 --> 11:29.349
My dad once told me
the world were flat.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.317
"From where I'm looking, son,"
he said,

11:31.400 --> 11:34.437
"from where I'm looking,
the world is flat."

11:34.520 --> 11:36.590
I believed him. I still do.

11:36.680 --> 11:39.558
- It's a fucking ball.
- Now, before you start,

11:39.640 --> 11:42.950
I don't give a fuck about outer space
or the view from up there.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.268
Where's Chad?

11:44.360 --> 11:46.794
And I've told Chad
the same. You ask him.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.440
Where is he? You ask him,
he'd tell ya.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.039
It's flat.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.959
Get you a pond, mush.
Innit, terrapin?

12:00.280 --> 12:02.874
God said you pass it down
from father to son.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.873
- From father, son, grandson.
- Hallelujah!

12:06.960 --> 12:10.191
What right-thinking man
would say wrong?

12:10.280 --> 12:13.955
As it were in the beginning,
is now, ever shall be,

12:14.040 --> 12:16.156
so help me God.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.696
- Amen!
- Fucksake, Bennett!

12:17.720 --> 12:19.915
Fucking hell, Gummidge.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.399
Kenny's a fucking idiot.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.519
I've stood up top the highest hill,
climbed up the highest tree,

12:25.640 --> 12:29.315
looked as far as my eyeballs'll stretch.
You know what, Tyson?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.994
- It was still flat.
- Flat, flat.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.976
What about the moon, then?
How do you explain that?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.912
I never did care for anything
any gorgie did say,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.594
nor His Majesty the Queen,
nor the army.

12:39.680 --> 12:43.593
What my dad said were the truth
and I'd fight any fucker who says else.

12:44.600 --> 12:45.828
Your bloody dad

12:45.920 --> 12:49.708
telling the same... bloody story
every bloody night.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.032
I mean, does he actually believe
we buy all that bollocks?

12:54.120 --> 12:56.190
Tyson actually does.

12:56.280 --> 13:00.068
Next thing is you being born in a manger
to a bloody Virgin Mary.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.390
You used to think him funny.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.438
Yeah, until he got Bryan
sent down.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.272
Tell you something, love.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.591
You get lalled, I'm not sticking 'round
here listening to him harp on.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.113
No chance.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.715
You did say we weren't living
with your dad forever, Chad.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.756
Where are the kids?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.796
Did you hear what I'm saying?

13:19.880 --> 13:23.953
I'm not asking you
to move into an house.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.553
Come on, Kelly Cutler.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.279
It's the weekend.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.352
You did promise.
You know that, Chad?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.511
I do promise.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.437
You know it's compilated.

14:00.560 --> 14:04.348
You can't stand up to your dad,
that's your problem.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.431
I'll show you my problem.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.790
You woke me up for this?

15:06.880 --> 15:08.438
I wanna talk to you.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.957
- What's happening, then, Chad?
- I'm tired.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.156
Come on, talk to me, boy.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.160
Nothing going on.
Sleep, that's all.

15:21.480 --> 15:25.393
So why the fuck did you behave
like such a little twat yesterday?

15:27.680 --> 15:30.990
Worse than the kids, you was.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.877
Fucking ignore me!

15:32.960 --> 15:34.916
What the fuck
you done that for?

15:35.000 --> 15:36.672
You got no idea, Chad.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.435
No idea the troubles I've had
putting all this together.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.478
And here you are, my eldest,
acting like the prize div.

15:43.560 --> 15:44.896
You know what my dad
once said to me?

15:44.920 --> 15:46.558
Yeah, I do.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.496
What the fuck is
the matter with you, then?

15:50.520 --> 15:52.988
I'm just trying
to look after my family, Col.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.719
What you say?

15:59.800 --> 16:02.439
I'm your family.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.476
You're forgetting who you are, boy.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.393
I swear to God, I will fucking smash
your puny little fucking skull

16:09.480 --> 16:14.713
and then I will pluck every little
pubic hair out of your bollocks

16:14.800 --> 16:17.109
if I think you're getting
anywhere close

16:17.200 --> 16:19.509
- to being a fucking gorgie.
- Come here.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.279
Give your dad a kiss.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.191
All right, then, Tyson?

16:25.280 --> 16:28.989
All right? Morning.
Glad you're here, me boy.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.548
Just saying,
we got a job for you, we have.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.039
Spell "Free Bryan."

16:34.040 --> 16:37.271
Fuh, fuh, eh...

16:37.360 --> 16:39.669
Right, come on, you do it.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.508
Right, there you go,
right there.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.750
Spell it.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.833
There we go, that's it.
Now we're a proper crew.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.749
You in with me and Ty,
then, Chad?

16:57.320 --> 16:58.548
That's it.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.433
There you are.
A little bit more.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.953
That's it, you've got it.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.234
- "Free Bryan"?
- Yeah.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.951
Just the tip of the brush,
that's it.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.994
Write "Fuck gavvas", Tyson.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.516
Could've at least chored a decent car.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.797
- First car I ever chored was a 6R4.
- No, you never.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.791
Have that!

19:09.240 --> 19:11.800
Let's go again.
Let's go to St. Paul's and find Johnson.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.536
No, man,
let's keep on at Lovage.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.176
- The motherfucker needs baiting.
- We've been at him all day long.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.416
I'm gonna gel.
You lot carry on.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.496
- Right, I'm driving.
- I'm driving.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.136
No, I'm fucking driving.
I'm driving. I'm driving.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.832
- Let me drive.
- I'm driving.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.399
How am I gonna get home?

19:23.480 --> 19:24.754
In that.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.353
Ah, great.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.237
The hottest car
in Gloucestershire.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.153
Every gavva in town
looking for us!

19:32.240 --> 19:33.559
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, mush.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.634
All right there, Chad?

20:10.720 --> 20:12.278
You know where he is.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.558
Let's see him, then.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.870
Six minutes.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.235
A clear winner.
Should improve, too.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.596
A beauty.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.514
You serious about this, then?

20:35.600 --> 20:39.513
Needs a bit of clearing up,
but with a bit of work...

20:39.600 --> 20:42.592
Never mind about that, Noah.
It's all right, innit?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.228
Got potentials.

20:46.320 --> 20:50.757
Thing is, Chad, you and your Kelly
and the kids are welcome up here.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.912
But we can't be having your old man
and his whole lot pitching up.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.675
We're a settled community, no troubles,
and I wanna keep it that way.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.352
It's all I want too.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.271
Somewhere near school
for Kelly and the kids.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.396
Good.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.756
There is one other thing, Chad.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.831
I'm not doing this
behind your Colby's back.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.514
I can't be on the wrong side
of your dad.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.151
Listen, I wanna take it.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.039
It's yours unless I hear otherwise.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.951
Means what I said, though.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.077
Give me a few days
to sort my shit out, okay?

21:24.160 --> 21:26.720
Cushty?

21:26.800 --> 21:28.791
Thanks, Noah.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.676
All right, Chad?

22:21.400 --> 22:23.231
Nice little stunt
you pulled earlier.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.829
Do you think I give a shit
about some driving misdemeanor?

22:26.920 --> 22:29.957
That was very original, Chad.
Well done.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.271
Was it Daddy's idea?
Did Daddy tell you to do it, did he?

22:34.280 --> 22:35.838
Don't know
what you're on about.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.879
How's Kelly?

22:41.880 --> 22:43.677
Getting old, ain't he,
your bitch?

22:43.760 --> 22:46.558
All right, Trousers.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.637
Richard Cutler, you're under arrest
on suspicion of driving a stolen car.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.120
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

22:54.160 --> 22:55.656
if you do not mention,
when questioned,

22:55.680 --> 22:58.035
anything you later rely on in court.

22:58.120 --> 23:00.714
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.311
Could've fucking murdered you.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.398
What were you doing
up there anyway?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.477
- Up where?
- You know where.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.357
I know his poxy site.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.668
Just having a mooch.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.439
A mooch? Stroll on.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.514
Gotta buy Tyson a bitch, ent I?
It's his birthday next week.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.115
Hadn't even got up there. Lovage
just come out of nowhere, prick.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.270
Stood no chances.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.674
Right.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.272
Got a job for you tonight,
all right?

24:33.840 --> 24:34.875
Fuck that.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.632
Some fatements in this one.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.600
Can't be doing with all that,
not tonight, mush.

24:38.640 --> 24:42.758
Oh, well, that's tough.
It's all set for tonight.

24:46.960 --> 24:48.359
What's the matter with you?

24:48.440 --> 24:50.670
- What?
- You heard.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.376
It's Sunday.
Why has it gotta be tonight?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.118
'Cause I fucking said so!

25:02.000 --> 25:04.514
Can we turn
this fuckin' music off?

25:16.040 --> 25:17.519
Mama.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.110
Mama!

25:24.120 --> 25:27.635
And we actually removed
a bay window and we found it under there

25:27.720 --> 25:28.994
and I've had it ever since,

25:29.080 --> 25:31.056
but my husband just keeps saying
it's a bit of old tat.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.435
But I just thought, well,
I'll bring it along.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.876
Bit of old tat. Have you worn
this bit of old tat?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.996
What does that say, Ty?

25:39.080 --> 25:40.798
Ha ha, you can't read!

25:40.880 --> 25:43.189
- Read it to him, Tyson.
- You little div.

25:47.360 --> 25:49.794
Oi, that hurts.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.472
Um, no, I just liked it,

25:51.560 --> 25:53.551
and I just-I just kept it.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.834
Are you coming, then, or what?

25:55.920 --> 25:58.514
- I'm coming.
- You're not going anywhere.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.115
...a collier de chien, a dog's collar
ornament, in diamonds...

26:02.200 --> 26:03.918
Eight grand.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.554
Eight grand for that?
Fuck off.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.393
...eight or nine thousand pounds.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.799
Pff.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.990
Oh, my God.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.355
Come on, then, Chad.
Let's gel.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.159
Listen, Kenny, I don't know
anything what Colby's on about.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.596
I never worked a Sunday in my life.
Calls himself Christian.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.636
You wants to do it,
you go and do it.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.836
Me, I'm not into that shit
no more.

26:25.920 --> 26:29.435
Just want a quiet life, me.
No troubles.

26:29.520 --> 26:31.909
What the fuck you on about?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.752
You can't sit 'round here
all night.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.673
Come on, Chad.
Sort it out, mush.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.753
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.668
- Just says it.
- Might as well go.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.469
I know you wanna go anyway.
Just fucking go.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.189
I'm staying here
with my family tonight.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.914
It's our anniversary.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.960
That's bollocks. I know it's not
your anniversary.

27:00.040 --> 27:03.032
- It is now.
- Ty, your dad's flapping.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.873
- What's happened to him, mush?
- Fuck off, Kenny.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.951
I know what you're doing.
Just fuck off.

27:15.560 --> 27:19.439
Sampson says you're on strike.
You a fucking miner now or what?

27:19.520 --> 27:21.875
Kenny's jobbing this one, Col.
He just said so.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.656
- What the fuck are you on about?
- I never.

27:23.680 --> 27:27.150
- Kenny's on it, Col.
- Is he fuck.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.595
Tyson's got more chance
of bossing it.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.956
What do you say, then, Ty?

27:36.720 --> 27:39.154
Wanna go on a job?

27:39.240 --> 27:42.949
- Yeah? Bit of driving?
- Yeah.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.000
Can I have a fag
for our mum, please?

27:57.840 --> 28:00.229
Go on, piss off.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.799
Where's fat cunt Norman?

28:01.880 --> 28:04.075
- Norman!
- Leave him alone, mush.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.475
- Where's Windows?
- Choring us a motor.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.634
- You been drinking, mush?
- I might have had a few ciders.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.056
You're off your head,
you are, Samp.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.594
Shut up flapping, Lest.
On and on.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.433
- He's got slippers on, Chad.
- "He's got slippers on, Chad."

28:19.200 --> 28:21.430
Ty, you little fucking devil.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.110
Stop being a dinlo, Sampson.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.816
All right,
who's gonna get the petrol?

29:05.840 --> 29:07.068
Not me.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.596
Right, Lest, get me 40 fags
as well.

29:10.680 --> 29:12.557
Why is it me
who's gotta get his face on TV?

29:12.640 --> 29:14.153
'Cause you's the most good-looking.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.438
For fuck's sake, Chad.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.348
Just 'cause Norman ain't here.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.238
- Bye, Lest.
- Fuck off.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.392
I swear on the mother's cunt,
them pills Lester's on,

29:27.480 --> 29:28.800
they're no good for no one, mush.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.916
Made him worser if anything.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.195
I took one once.
Dreamt I sucked off a dog.

29:33.280 --> 29:36.511
Spunk an' all.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.955
- What were it?
- Were antidepressives.

29:39.040 --> 29:40.473
No, what were the dog?

29:40.560 --> 29:43.870
Oh, it were a Labrador.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.554
- It was a nice blonde retriever.
- You sick son of a cunt.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.353
You're a sick fucking bastard,
you know that, Sampson?

29:55.880 --> 29:57.199
All right?

29:57.280 --> 29:59.236
- I've got keys, Chad.
- Gel, gel!

30:02.440 --> 30:04.078
Gel, gel.

30:06.280 --> 30:08.236
Lalled choring the petrol.
Quick, Chad, gel.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.520
What the fuck you done that for?
I gave you the scrilla.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.357
I told you, I'm not getting my face on TV.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.557
You fucking div. You don't think got
cameras at the pumps?

30:15.640 --> 30:17.596
- What?
- Mongs of petrol in here now.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.796
If we get in a chase
and I ain't got no fags,

30:19.920 --> 30:23.151
I'm having you, Lester,
I'm fucking having you.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.590
Is it true we come from fishes?

31:07.600 --> 31:10.398
- What'd you say?
- It's what they said at school.

31:13.040 --> 31:15.873
You just listen to me, me boy,
and listen good.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.428
No one is about to tell me
I come from the arse of an ape.

31:22.440 --> 31:25.512
Or that your granddaddy
were a goldfish. Really.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.151
What a load of bollocks.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.474
You really think God made us
from a fish?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.232
Teacher said.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.709
Well, they're fannies, then.
Great big fannies.

31:39.800 --> 31:44.510
Don't you listen to 'em, Ty.
Don't listen to 'em.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.989
From fishes. Yeah, well,
maybe her ancestors.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.638
Not mine, not yours.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.440
I thought school was supposed
to teach you common senses.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.869
I don't like it there.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.997
Fucking waste of time,
if you ask me.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.071
They're trying
to control your mind.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.516
That's why I never
did send Chad to school.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.319
You've gotta stand up
against these cunts, Tyson.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.388
So they don't trespass
against us.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.295
Yeah, it were
like a fucking museum!

34:12.320 --> 34:13.911
That were some fate, that.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.400
Did you see
all them regal outgowns?

34:15.480 --> 34:18.790
I chored one of his wigs,
wrapped it all in his gown.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.952
He were a judge.
He were a fucking judge!

34:26.080 --> 34:29.231
- First little stretch I done...
- Oi! Tyson!

34:29.320 --> 34:33.871
Chad would have been a bit younger
than you... About five he was, I think.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.757
Yeah.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.877
Everyone does a bit of time,
you know, sooner or later.

34:40.560 --> 34:44.599
Can be God's medicine,
prison can be, Tyson.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.318
Teaches you what's important.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.755
Evening, Kelly.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.840
Ty's gotta go to bed now.
He's got school tomorrow.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.518
Could I just finish my story?

34:52.600 --> 34:54.670
Don't go filling his head
with all this jank, Col.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.478
We was talking about his dog.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.438
Don't ignore me, Tyson Cutler.
Get your skinny little arse out.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.776
I tell you, that school's been
rokkering him some right wrongs.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.756
Say what you like.
He's still going.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.354
All right, then.
Listen to your ma.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.749
- Don't want to.
- I know. No one does.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.474
But I say so.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.471
I'm not bloody having this, Col.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.834
Kel.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.553
Dogs can only play with cats so long
before it's the dog that gets scratched.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.795
That's rapid response,
that is, Chad.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.394
I'll deal with them.
Just get everything in the van.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.976
I'm fucking
coming with you, Chad.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.256
- I'm not staying with the fatements.
- What about you, Samps?

35:56.280 --> 35:58.600
Well, I'm not missing a fucking chase.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.312
All right, who we got, then?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.896
- We got Carlin.
- And that fuckhead Roberts.

36:08.920 --> 36:11.559
- Roberts is a fucking awesome driver.
- Is he fuck.

36:15.360 --> 36:16.793
Stop touching me, Sampson!

36:25.240 --> 36:27.616
Do your drunk driving, Chad.
Do your drunk driving.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.696
- All right, get the fire thingy.
- On it, mush.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.896
- Oi, what you doing, Sampson?
- Time to get off-road.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.273
Not my fire extinguisher!

36:39.360 --> 36:41.271
I chored that.
Oi, Chad, tell him to let me...

36:41.360 --> 36:42.976
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Lester?

36:46.880 --> 36:48.552
On Ricky's corner, mush.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.953
All right, let it rip, Samps.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.076
Fucking have that!

36:58.200 --> 36:59.872
Jesus fucking Christ!

37:07.040 --> 37:09.076
Let me bail out, Chad.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.639
I know a bird
who lives 'round here.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.360
Gavvas are still
right behind us.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.038
Who gives a fuck?

37:16.240 --> 37:18.834
He's a proper dirty sex pest,
he is.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.992
Didn't have to jump.
I was just about to stop.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.314
Fuck you doing, Chad?

37:24.400 --> 37:27.472
Told you, I fucking hate
chases without fags.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.836
You forgot 'em, Lester.
You go get 'em.

37:30.920 --> 37:33.309
Fucking not going in there.
You'll leave me behind.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.152
Off your fucking head,
you are, Chad.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.715
I got the money.
I got the money.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.711
20 Denmans.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.589
No, 40.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.158
And a pack of Maltesers.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.348
Keep the change.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.256
- Cushty, mush.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.389
I think you should actually
stop smoking, Chad.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.556
You sure, Chad?

41:39.160 --> 41:40.798
No, no. Fuck!

41:42.360 --> 41:44.396
Oh, f...

41:44.520 --> 41:45.748
Oh, no...

41:46.800 --> 41:48.074
Fuck.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.912
Oh, fuck.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.714
You fucking bastard!

43:37.480 --> 43:39.118
You could have
fucking picked me up.

43:40.120 --> 43:44.636
Four hours I walked back.
I were waiting for you at the tree.

43:45.880 --> 43:48.917
What happened, then, son?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.639
Rabid response,
that's what happened.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.957
Start at the beginning.

43:55.040 --> 43:57.110
I fucking killed Trousers.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.988
- Who?
- Trousers. Lovage's bitch.

44:01.080 --> 44:03.878
Oh, right. Yeah.

44:03.960 --> 44:05.234
Who was they in the house?

44:07.480 --> 44:09.391
Who gives a fuck?
Come on, sit down.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.189
Have an Amaretto,
a little father and sonly.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.271
Tell me what happened.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.798
Well, fuck ya.

45:09.720 --> 45:11.256
...ever be able to.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.271
A huge haul of antiques has been stolen

45:13.360 --> 45:16.557
in what could turn out to be one of
Britain's biggest domestic robberies.

45:16.640 --> 45:19.757
Thieves targeted the Lord Lieutenant
of Gloucestershire's home in Purgrove,

45:19.840 --> 45:21.558
just outside Cheltenham.

45:21.640 --> 45:25.519
The private art collection at the manor
was valued at tens of millions of pounds.

45:25.600 --> 45:28.990
The loss has not yet been assessed,
but is believed to be considerable.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.376
The Lord Lieutenant arrived
back at his house this morning,

45:31.400 --> 45:32.879
but was unavailable for comment.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.992
Chad. Chad, wake up.
You're on the news.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.914
This follows a series
of identical burglaries in the area.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.070
We have good reason
to believe it was carried out

45:42.160 --> 45:43.639
by the same
highly professional gang.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.399
National news.
For fuck's sake, Chad.

45:48.320 --> 45:51.710
They're gonna come after you now,
you know they will.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.189
- I need to go back to sleep, Kel.
- No way.

45:54.280 --> 45:57.750
You're doing the school run.
I'm taking Norman to the hospital.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.390
- He's under warrant, Kel.
- I know he is.

46:02.480 --> 46:04.675
That's your fucking fault as well.

46:04.760 --> 46:07.399
And Worzel bloody burnt
the kids' slippers.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.675
I can't be living with the pissy arse
much longer.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.591
All right, monkey.

46:13.680 --> 46:15.477
Leave your Dad alone.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.677
What time did you get back?

46:18.760 --> 46:21.035
Never you mind.
You ready for school?

46:21.120 --> 46:23.509
Don't want to.
I want to go to the fair with Colby.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.478
You've got three minutes to make it
to the car. You hear me, Ty?

46:26.560 --> 46:27.993
Tyson?

46:45.600 --> 46:48.478
All right, Tyson,
let your granddad in.

46:51.240 --> 46:53.196
Out the car, Worzel.

46:53.280 --> 46:56.795
Aw! Leave him alone, Chad.

46:56.880 --> 46:59.792
You heard. Out the car, Gummidge.

47:04.640 --> 47:06.437
I ain't moving
whilst he's in here.

47:06.520 --> 47:09.478
Don't be childish.
Worse than the kids.

47:12.520 --> 47:15.080
All right, out.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.832
No chickens at school today.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.434
Fucking national news, Dad.

47:32.520 --> 47:35.273
- Weren't you in the news, son.
- Might as well have been.

47:35.360 --> 47:39.114
Your dad's a legend, Tyson.

47:39.200 --> 47:40.519
Hiding under cows.

47:40.600 --> 47:42.636
Don't teach you that at school,
do they?

47:45.320 --> 47:47.336
Don't you ever think
what actually happens in there?

47:47.360 --> 47:48.952
You know what I reckon of it,
don't ya?

47:49.040 --> 47:51.554
You two'd be better off coming
to the fair with your granddad.

47:51.680 --> 47:54.956
Oi, they're my fucking kids, Col, and I do
what I like with 'em. Give us a kiss.

47:57.120 --> 48:00.476
No swearing, not at school.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.676
No swearing?
What's that about?

48:02.760 --> 48:05.228
God given right to swear.

48:05.360 --> 48:08.875
Oi, Tyson, tell your teachers
to go fuck their mothers!

48:12.800 --> 48:14.631
They ain't gonna airlift you,
is they, Norman?

48:14.720 --> 48:16.736
- All right, Kel.
- Get your fat arse ready.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.034
I'm coming!

48:18.120 --> 48:20.554
Kelly, Chad has sent me
to protect you.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.278
You stay away from me,
Bennett, you hear?

48:22.360 --> 48:24.635
- I got a chicken for you, Kel.
- Stuff it.

48:35.920 --> 48:37.148
Shh.

48:43.240 --> 48:47.279
He's a wrong 'un.
Don't want him around my kids.

48:47.400 --> 48:51.518
Can't be held responsibles
if it carries on playing up.

48:51.600 --> 48:56.196
Love thy neighbor, Chad,
that's one of the ten.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.713
I'll tell you an eleventh.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.153
It's one of me own
and I mean it.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.708
Stop whinging like a fanny
about Gordon.

49:01.800 --> 49:05.873
The man's ill, got problems.
I'm looking after him.

49:05.960 --> 49:07.188
Leave it.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.396
You got something to tell me,
then, or what?

49:18.480 --> 49:20.789
Chored a small fortune
out of that house, Chad.

49:20.880 --> 49:24.350
I don't give a fuck, Col.
Not about any of it.

49:24.480 --> 49:26.198
Who the fuck
cares about clocks?

49:26.280 --> 49:28.589
I'm telling you,
fuck this country house malarkey.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.955
Not worth the cars, mush.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.951
The future's
in the intraweb, Col.

49:33.040 --> 49:36.237
That's where it's all going.
The wise world business.

49:36.320 --> 49:39.949
No son of mine is about to start
with any of that crap.

49:40.080 --> 49:43.550
What the fuck you know about computers?
You can't even read.

49:43.640 --> 49:47.269
Can't be plotting dreams
of another life now, son.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.477
Gonna come down hard on you.
You killed Trousers.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.392
You just need to concentrate
on what's coming down the road at you.

49:54.480 --> 49:56.198
Kingdom fucking come,
if you ask me.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.909
Fuck all to do with Trousers, Col.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.070
Poxy house was your idea.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.513
I gotta go back to bed.

50:37.520 --> 50:38.794
- Chad.
- Mm?

50:40.440 --> 50:41.953
Chad!

50:42.040 --> 50:44.952
Where's the kids?

50:45.040 --> 50:48.510
What do you mean?
They're at school.

50:48.600 --> 50:52.070
They never went to school, Chad.

50:52.160 --> 50:55.277
- I took 'em there.
- You never.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.193
I fucking did, you know.
Ask me dad.

50:58.280 --> 51:01.431
Are you fucking joking me?

51:01.520 --> 51:03.317
Don't wind me up, Chad.
I've just been there.

51:03.400 --> 51:05.994
They ain't been at school
all fucking day!

51:06.080 --> 51:09.152
They're in enough trouble as it is.
Come on, get up.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.072
Little bastards.

51:14.040 --> 51:17.510
Little div. I'm gonna rip him up
when I see him.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.376
I tell you what, Kelly,
I fucking dropped them off.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.868
- You've gotta walk 'em in.
- I hadn't fucking slept.

51:21.960 --> 51:25.316
They'd better be with your dad. I tell you
what, Chad, they better fucking had be.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.914
I can't live like this no more.
Can't do it, I've had enough.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.150
I've found us somewhere already.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.912
Everything's done.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.309
- We stop up at Noah's.
- Since when?

51:35.600 --> 51:37.875
Does Colby know?

51:37.960 --> 51:42.397
Let's just find the kids.
We can talk all of this later.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.119
You should have told me, Chad.

51:47.120 --> 51:50.271
I suppose if you ain't told your dad,
it don't count for shit anyway.

52:16.200 --> 52:17.519
Have you seen Colby?

52:43.520 --> 52:46.478
Seen Tyson? Mini?

52:52.280 --> 52:54.840
Walter, have you seen Colby?

52:54.920 --> 52:57.070
Yeah, he's gone down there
by the wagons, of course.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.598
Colby!

53:01.680 --> 53:04.240
Here he is. Look at this.
My son and heir!

53:04.320 --> 53:06.788
Your ears must be burning.

53:06.880 --> 53:09.440
- Are the kids here with you?
- You're my kid, Chad.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.432
I'm not messing. Are they here?
They've been missing all day.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.273
They're kids.
That's what they do.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.828
- I thought they were here with you.
- Well, they ent.

53:17.920 --> 53:19.353
Should be here.

53:19.440 --> 53:21.496
Sorry, but that's what happens
when you send them to school.

53:21.520 --> 53:23.376
- Keep trying to tell you.
- I haven't got time for this.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.435
We gotta go find 'em.

53:24.520 --> 53:26.750
Just put a wager on, Chad.
Just getting good.

54:56.280 --> 54:58.999
Can I ask where
the children's father is?

54:59.080 --> 55:02.038
Please, I'm here
about my babbies.

55:02.120 --> 55:06.910
We're here to help you.
I hope you know that.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.231
But you need to help us now, Kelly.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.392
You need to tell us where your husband
was last night,

55:13.480 --> 55:16.313
and I promise that we will make
your life a lot easier...

55:16.400 --> 55:17.958
Are you fucking joking me?

55:18.040 --> 55:21.157
No, I'm not fucking joking you, Kelly.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.390
You need to help us
to help you.

55:23.480 --> 55:26.153
Not too late to get out,
you know.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.755
Before it all comes on top.

55:29.840 --> 55:32.149
Are your mum and dad
still not speaking to you?

55:32.240 --> 55:34.959
Well, you can talk to us.
You know that, don't you?

55:35.040 --> 55:37.349
And we'll take you straight
into protective custody,

55:37.440 --> 55:39.192
right now, you and the kids.

55:39.280 --> 55:44.229
My babbies have been missing 12 hours
and you want me to go gammy?

55:44.360 --> 55:45.759
Heartless bastards, ain't you?

55:45.840 --> 55:48.832
No, no, we're not
heartless bastards, sweetheart.

55:51.360 --> 55:54.591
Actually, I've been thinking
about you all day, as it happens.

55:54.680 --> 55:58.116
I've been thinking, what is it like
being Kelly Cutler?

56:00.080 --> 56:05.359
Sitting up there by yourself every night
thinking, "Where is he?

56:05.440 --> 56:08.910
Is he coming home
or is tonight the night?" Hmm?

56:10.160 --> 56:14.199
I mean, what does go through
your little brain when he's out thieving?

56:18.080 --> 56:21.675
Don't know
what you're on about.

56:21.760 --> 56:25.116
Please... my kids are missing.

56:31.240 --> 56:33.576
It's Noah. Leave a message if you want.

56:33.600 --> 56:37.149
Noah, it's Chad.

56:37.240 --> 56:40.038
Give me a call back, mush,
on this number.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.558
We dropped them off at school
this morning.

56:52.640 --> 56:55.871
The headmistress said
they never went in.

56:55.960 --> 56:58.315
Yeah, well...

56:58.400 --> 57:00.994
Your kids have told us everything
we wanna know already.

57:03.120 --> 57:05.475
They're here with us right now.

57:05.560 --> 57:08.154
Oh! Oh, my God!

57:08.240 --> 57:11.437
Picked them up this morning.

57:11.520 --> 57:13.715
- What, this morning?
- Mm-hmm.

57:14.720 --> 57:16.736
What, you fucking kidnapped
my kids and not told me?

57:16.760 --> 57:18.193
Shut your filthy gob.

57:18.280 --> 57:20.350
See, Chad's done us a favor this time.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.237
Have you any idea
who he robbed last night?

57:22.320 --> 57:25.676
- I don't give a fuck.
- We will get him, Kelly.

57:25.760 --> 57:29.196
We will get your Chad,
and you know it, too.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.709
You'll never be able
to go coursing ever again.

57:36.800 --> 57:40.952
I'm never gonna
take you hunting, ever.

57:41.040 --> 57:42.792
Do you understand?

57:42.880 --> 57:44.576
You'll never be able
to ride the quad again.

57:44.600 --> 57:47.068
I'm getting rid of it,
smashing that bike up.

57:47.160 --> 57:50.197
I'm gonna give it to Worzel.
He's burning your bike tonight.

57:50.320 --> 57:53.790
- Wanted to chore a dog.
- No more dogs, not for you.

57:53.880 --> 57:56.394
You took your sister
and then went and got arrested.

57:56.480 --> 57:59.517
You are in trouble forever.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.876
Do you understand?
In trouble forever.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.233
Me, I've never been arrested.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.517
- Bloody have, Chad. All the bloody time.
- No, I haven't.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.591
I've never been charged.

58:14.520 --> 58:17.990
You, though, Ty, are in trouble
forever with them lot now.

58:18.080 --> 58:19.991
They'll be out to get you now, Ty.

58:53.520 --> 58:55.336
Armed police.
Don't you fucking move.

58:55.360 --> 58:57.715
Over on your front, nice and slow.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.840
- Do what they says, kids.
- Get the fuck...

58:59.880 --> 59:01.438
Tyson.

59:01.520 --> 59:02.839
Tyson, it's all right.

59:04.080 --> 59:06.336
- Don't you touch my fucking kids.
- Get down! Don't move!

59:06.360 --> 59:08.715
- I want my dad!
- Get down!

59:08.800 --> 59:10.995
Stop pointing
that fucking thing at my kids!

59:13.080 --> 59:14.576
- All right, Mini!
- Get him outside now.

59:14.600 --> 59:17.273
- Fuck yourself. Where are your numbers?
- Shut your mouth.

59:17.360 --> 59:18.475
Come on.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.496
- Shoot me in front of my own family?
- Get outside now!

59:20.520 --> 59:23.353
Where are your numbers?
Where are your numbers?

59:23.440 --> 59:25.431
Where are your numbers?

59:27.880 --> 59:29.632
Get your fucking hands off me!

59:41.320 --> 59:42.992
You got a warrant?

59:43.080 --> 59:44.672
My kids gotta go to school.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.079
Get down!

59:47.640 --> 59:49.995
Let me speak
to my fucking kids!

59:50.080 --> 59:52.878
It's all right, Ty.
It's all right, Mini.

59:52.960 --> 59:56.430
- It's all right, my babbies.
- Up, up, up, up.

59:56.520 --> 59:59.114
- Come on.
- You filthy pig dog gavvas.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.357
What you call policing, is it,
traumatizing my kids?

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.352
- Get in.
- I'm having you!

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.912
I love you, Kelly!

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.156
Love you, Ty, Mini!

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.876
Shh...

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.198
Let's get these
wet trousers off, eh?

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.477
Let's get 'em off.
Let's take 'em off.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.516
Wet trousers.
Put them over there.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.390
It's all right, Mini.
It's all right.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:46.029
You did good, you know?
You did real good today.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.429
Never seen that money in my life.
You must have put it there.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:34.671
Grow up, Chad.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.034
It's not mine.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.393
Oh...

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.237
Oh, I get it.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.639
That's funny.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.792
Is it Kelly's little stash?

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.793
Oh, that cracks me up.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.553
You're all at it, aren't you?
'Course you are.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.878
It just makes me think
why, though, hm?

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.110
Why's Kelly hiding money
from you?

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.751
Money were mine, all right?

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.912
Make your mind up, Chad.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.312
Poxy few grand.
A man's allowed to have a stash.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.440
If that's all you got me on,
I'm walking in no time.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.988
You're not going anywhere.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.550
So you say you spent the whole
evening with your son, Chad Cutler.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.155
We have spent the whole of every day
of his life together.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.677
So, tell me, in as much detail
as you can, what you did.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.991
Told you already.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.868
After I'd given him a bath,
I put his jimjams on him

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.112
and read him a bedtime story
about how fucking stupid you lot are,

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.633
and tucked him up in bed.

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.393
Now, and this is
none of your fucking business,

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.189
but as he were nodding off
to travel at will in his sleep...

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.672
I told him
that he were a fucking legend,

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.998
and that he were my son and heir,
and that I love him.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:16.194
I just... I can't work this one out,
though.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.714
A lord lieutenant, hm?

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.280
It's a very odd choice,
given what he does.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.870
You did do your homework,
didn't you, Chad?

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.111
You do know
what a lord lieutenant is, don't you?

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:37.438
Well...

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.833
Well, Chad, my friend, my little friend,
a lord lieutenant...

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.833
is the one up there
who swears in all the judges.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.037
Do you know what that means, Chad?
Mm? Do you?

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.398
It means that every single policeman,
magistrate,

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.114
every traffic warden in this county

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.192
will not rest until you're in jail.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.070
No, no, hear me out.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:13.154
Jesus died on the cross
because of people like you.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.435
Well, I ain't
letting it happen again.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.318
Just 'cause one of His Majesty
the Queen's little chavvies

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.392
wants to make me and my family
into the escape goats.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.959
That's what it feels like.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:26.430
I feel like some stupid...
some sac...

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.875
no, sacrificial goat,
that's it.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.838
I feel like a sacrificial goat.

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:34.388
Well, let me tell you,
them goats

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:38.029
can kick, and bite,
and scream, and scratch,

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:42.193
and poke your eyes out too,
and they can start fires.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.636
The horns are sharper
than yours.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:49.918
Them goats can turn
into super-goats.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.116
And you can lock
them super-goats up,

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.310
but what I have heard is this.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.597
Hell hath no fury
like a locked-up super-goat.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.194
You got no rights to be keeping me here,
no rights whatsoever.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.669
I've got every right.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.509
I know it was you, Chad.
I know it was.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:24.919
"Your Honor, I know it was him.
You see, I just know."

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.671
You're a dumb fuck, you are.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.271
You got nothing on me,
have you?

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.351
Dumb, motherless fuck.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.555
Fuck off home
to look after your mutt.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.711
You gonna fucking charge me
or what?

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.554
Wait here.
I'll get you your scrilla.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.720
Don't worry, mate.
I'm not gonna do you.

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.314
- Where are you from, anyway?
- Iraq.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.356
So you know what this is like, then.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.557
All right, my little shithead?
All right?

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.754
- Where's Ty?
- With Granddad.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.591
Fucking nightmare, Chad.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.956
They've trashed everything,
taken all the animals.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.230
And Norman's been lalled.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.790
Got any money, Kel?
Think you might have.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.239
Would have given it, you know.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.511
At least I would have hided it better.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.518
It's all right, Kel.
We're all getting out of here now.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.598
Taking us all up to Noah's.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.955
Just pay the driver
and I'll make us a brew.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.476
Get out the car.
Get out the fucking car.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.596
You got a ticket parking there?

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:37.035
Huh?

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.478
Huh?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.278
I'll chew your balls
and spit 'em out.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.759
Oi, Worzel!

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:49.119
Are you fucking deaf?
Huh? Deaf? Deaf?

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.998
It's fuckin' 35 quid
to fucking park here.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.193
That's King Cutler's plot!
Now, go on, fuck off!

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.038
Where's all the dogs gone, Chad?
Tyson loved my dogs.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.076
They ain't your dogs.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.799
I miss my dogs, Chad.
The dogs are my babbies.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.518
Shut up about the fucking dogs.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.068
Wearing my trousers?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.113
Where'd you get my boots?

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.475
Where'd you get my boots,
you thieving little prick?

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:32.997
Ah!

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.520
Kenny, come here
and give us an hand!

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:36.548
Fuck off, Kenny.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.870
Sorry, Gummidge,
but I feels like hurtin' you.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.595
Get me one of the catapults.
Get me Colby's catapult!

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.358
They all long gone, Chad,
long gone.

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:47.032
Anything you fucking like, Ken.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.270
Shut up, Bennett.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:51.316
You can have 'em back.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.832
Can't wear 'em now, eh?

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:55.639
I don't want them. Ah!

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.950
- Who's the fucking dog now?
- I am, Chad.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.270
Who's the doggy?
Come on, doggy.

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:01.587
Come on, doggy.

01:09:03.279 --> 01:09:05.395
Come on, doggy.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.120
What the fuck you want me
to do with that?

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.116
I don't wanna kill him, mush.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.111
Pass that.

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.736
- Who's the dog now?
- I am, Chad.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.095
Who's the dog now?
Who's the doggy now?

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.758
I am, Chad. I'm the doggy.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.676
I'm the doggy, Chad.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.511
Rip him pants down.

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.399
Hold that.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.438
What d'you say, then?

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:54.270
Fuck you done, Chad?

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.670
After everything,
you took it out on Gordon?

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.352
No better than they are.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.596
- Call yourself a Cutler?
- Fuck being a Cutler.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.948
Son...

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.479
It's all right.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.989
It's all right.
It's all right now.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.956
I'm glad you're home.
I'm glad you're home.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.391
Got a lot to talk about,
haven't we?

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.312
Here's the truth.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.153
No one out there loves you more...

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:34.435
than this man here.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.238
Hold that.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.631
Now, I were also thinking...

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.719
that when Jesus was being executed
by the police,

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.358
he never did give up.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.635
Came back to life, didn't he?

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.349
He came back
and he turned to his 12.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.232
You know what he said?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.313
He turned to his lot
and he said... "Travel."

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.112
Stop laughing, Sampson.
I'm not joking.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.674
He said, "Gel on."

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.591
Now, you hear this.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.432
Everyone out there,

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.832
from his royal high-arse,
MI5, CID...

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.591
They all wanna do us in now.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.956
They wanna kill the lot of us,
kill our seed.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.073
But they ent beaten us yet.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.038
We're still together.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.270
Together we'll be strong, ent it?

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.269
It's gonna start raining down
on all of us pretty soon.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:44.756
Mark my words.
It's gonna come down hard.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.235
And they will break you
on your own, you know that.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.311
But not if we stay tight.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.236
That's why I say let's fuck off to Kent,
all of us.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.278
I'm not stopping in Kent.
No fucking way.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.278
Travel and conquer, Chad.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:10.193
No, you go to Kent
if you want to, Col.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.795
The kids have got school here
and I got plans of me own.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.154
Come on.

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:20.513
I'm telling you...
travel and conquer.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.439
You'll see.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.112
All right, Chad?

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.834
- Where's Noah?
- He's not here. He's out.

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.639
Why don't he ever call me back?

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.154
- Hallelujah. Say hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.318

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.951
He feels bad, I feel bad,
but we had no choice.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.598
You spoke to Colby.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.399
Your dad was up here
same day you came.

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.919
- Same day?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.718
He weren't having it.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:42.588
Threatened to burn the loft.
Threatened that, Chad.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:48.910
Tell Noah thanks for nothing.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.878
That's not so bad, eh?

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.869
Colby!

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.951
Colby, where the fuck are you?!

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.870
You fucked me.
You fucked me.

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.416
Could have murdered you
for less, Chad.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.431
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.957
See what you made me done now.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.752
It's all over, Chad.
We're finished 'round here.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.229
Fucking getting away from you, Col.

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:32.590
- All right, birthday boy?
- Happy birthday, Tyson!

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.671
Happy birthday, mush.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.798
All right, my babby?

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.950
You can do
whatever you like today, Ty.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.678
You can both
have the day off school.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.239
They fucking cannot, Chad.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.038
We've all gotta go down there
this morning.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.112
What? It's his birthday.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.816
Still gotta go to school
on your birthday.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.229
Anyway, Mrs Crawley wants to speak to us
about something.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.037
Well, why don'ts me and you get up
and have a go at them rabbits first?

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.315
- You can drive, Ty.
- Up you get, mush.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.436
Fucking sleeping, all right?

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.916
Suit yourself,
you little maggot.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.393
Fuck off.

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.436
I reckon, Kelly,
if I tickle him here...

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.953
Fuck off!

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.036
Fucking doesn't matter,
does it, Ty?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.554
It's all right.
It's all right, love.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.318
Mr. Cutler?

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.834
Hello, I'm Diane Crawley.
I'm Ty's class teacher.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.036
I don't think
we've met properly.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.111
Hello. Do you want
to come through, both of you?

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:00.551
So, um...

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.679
I'm sorry to have asked you
to come here this morning, but...

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.911
I felt that it was important
to talk to you in person

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.560
about the best interests
of Ty and Mini.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.553
I think they've made
tremendous progress here.

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.950
They're very happy here,
ain't they, Chad?

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.750
Um... however, as...
as I think you know,

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:27.356
they have both fallen considerably behind
the rest of their class.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.399
Now, this is partly because
of their continued absences,

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.076
which really go well beyond
what would normally be acceptable.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:40.118
Well, we are...
we are really sorry about that.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.599
Things have been...

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.151
Things have been...
tough recently,

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.832
especially for the kids.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.959
Yes. What I...
What I'm trying to s...

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.238
Mr. and Mrs. Cutler,

01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:00.108
I don't think that Ty
and Mini's best interests

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.749
are served at Churtle
Primary School anymore.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.152
I've really done everything
I can to keep them here,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:14.588
but, after recent events,
it's been decided that it's for the best.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.638
Who says?

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:26.158
There have been
several complaints.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.038
There are other schools
that I can refer you to

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.031
that might be better suited
to their needs.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.588
There ain't nothing wrong
with my kids!

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.238
Mrs. Cutler, please.

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:37.959
Chad...

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.473
This is a very small school

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.075
and we rely on the support
of the local community.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:48.029
No one has the right to stop my
kids from learning an education, no one.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.958
Why? Cause of something
that has got nothing to do with them!

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.640
- No way! Fuck that!
- Mrs. Cutler, please.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.280
- Let's just get out of here.
- No, you fucking stay out of this.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.388
Oh, walk away, Chad.
That's it, you walk away.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.755
This is your fucking fault,
you know that?

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.035
I wanted them an education, Kel.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:09.998
- I wanted them one.
- Yeah...

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.310
So they wouldn't turn out like you.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.875
I thought I heard someone
out here.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.428
- You must be Norman.
- Yeah, I'm Norman.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.714
I got the money.

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:02.395
Right, well, come on in, lad.
Come in.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.436
It was a litter of seven,

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.432
but there's just a bitch
and two males left now.

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.397
Lovely mother.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.118
You're not from round here,
are you?

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.519
No.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.672
It's funny, I could have sworn
I recognize you from somewhere.

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.599
This one.
I'll have this one.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:36.750
Right. Give him to me.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.072
You just need to finish off the paperwork.
It won't take long.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.513
What's this?

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.909
Well, it's for the pedigree license.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.639
And for our records too.
We like to know where they all end up.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.792
You understand.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.510
- I'm not sure about that.
- What do you mean, son?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.239
Me hand written's terrible.
Could you write it for me?

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:03.512
I do know you, don't I?

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:06.672
Bloody hell. I'm not selling
my dogs to a bloody...

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.797
To a bloody what?

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.996
What were you gonna say?

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:14.953
I don't want any trouble, son.

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.673
Nor do I.

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.116
I just wanna buy a dog.
All right?

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.997
I've got the money.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.310
Go on.
It's for me son.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.275
- I can't do it. It wouldn't be fair on...
- On who? The dog?

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.510
What's that supposed to mean?

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.477
This is prejudices,
you know that?

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.152
I'll call the police.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.435
Mavis!
Mavis, call the police!

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:43.071
There ain't no need for that, right?
Fuck you, you fucking gorgie cunt.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.756
I don't want your fucking gorgie dogs
out your fucking gorgie house. Fuck off!

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:19.038
Keep the change, you cunt.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.994
- Move.
- Excuse?

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:28.308
Move.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.190
Come on, mush. Jump in.
I ain't gonna leave you in this shithole.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.555
Here, look after me juk.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.400
I knew I shouldn't have
come with you again.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.239
Stop flapping, Jail, mate.
I'll pay you for the car.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.072
Tell me, why you driving
through a field?

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.550
It's good, a bit of cross-country.
Just for the views.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.235
You know, Jammy, if I could have done
anything, I would have been a painter.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.788
You know, an artist.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.472
There's big money in art, mush.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.715
It's my kid's birthday today,
you know.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.588
Fucking seven years old.
Can't believe that.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.035
It flies, don't it?

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.633
You got kids, Jail?

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.598
Hard, ent it?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.910
To do all right by 'em,
teach 'em, you know.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.519
Helicopter.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.111
Fuck's sake, Jammy.
It's me who's gonna be lalled.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.599
You haven't done nothing wrong.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.032
Listen, Jammy, listen,
I need to use your phone.

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:32.033
What?

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.833
All right?

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:39.798
What you done that for?

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.113
I'm still your dad, ent I?

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.632
We'll be there.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.033
Chad's been lalled.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:16.315
He wants me to bring Tyson.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.631
He's heading to the oak tree
by the old site.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.554
Are you coming?

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.917
Dogs and cats, Kel.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:34.076
Tyson! Ty!

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.438
- Cushty, mush.
- Good luck, Chad.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.235
- Have that!
- Have that!

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.999
- Charlie Bravo, this is PC1267.
- Go ahead, 1267.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.871
Suspect Richard Cutler
is now up a tree.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.280
Roger that.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:10.029
Yeah, we got him.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.593
You make yourself comfortable
up there, Chad.

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:42.113
Have that.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.356
Foxtrot Alpha requesting
backup for tree extraction.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.631
Oh, for fuck...

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.192
Right, Cutler, I'm warning you,

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.716
if any of you so much as step out
of this vehicle, I promise you...

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.080
- Oi, Gordon...
- Chad!

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:22.031
Gordon...
Gordon, get back in the car.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.856
Gordon, you heard
what the officer said.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.110
- Gordon. Cutler.
- ...back in the car.

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.296
He's out of control.
I don't know what to do with him.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.390
What's going on here?
He's not listening.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.936
- Cutler, get back.
- What's happenin'?

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.234
We're arresting him.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.630
Aggravated trespass, breaking
and entering, actual bodily harm,

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.915
theft of property.
The list goes on.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.871
It's all over now,
so just fuck off.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.672
Chad, what you doing up there?

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:45.718
I ain't coming down.
Fuck that.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.149
Think I don't have my own problems

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.231
without you playing
cat and dog with this lot?

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.595
What you doing?

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.269
Gordon.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.715
Gordon!
Gordon, get back here!

01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.030
- Fuck off, Lovage!
- Gordon, don't be an idiot!

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.998
- I am an idiot!
- Get back! Fuck's sake!

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.629
Gordon, get back in the car!
Gordon!

01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.279
For fuck's sake!

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:12.112
Boy's got a right to climb a tree.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.668
All right, you little maggot?

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.474
What sort of a man
puts a boy up in a tree now?

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.233
It's his dad,
for Holy Trinity's sake.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.118
I fucking love you, Kel!

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.590
Fucking love you, Cutler.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:33.199
Love you, Mini.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.554
That's it, Ty.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.710
Nice one, Gordon.
Well done.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:46.028
Thanks.

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.595
Think you dropped your hat.

01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.677
That's it.
That's my boy.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:04.675
Should be having you, you little cunt.
You knows I love you, Ty.

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.479
What's that?

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.039
Your birthday, innit, mush?

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.959
Come here.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:17.114
Here.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.199
Think of a name.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:23.669
- Can't.
- Yeah, you can, Ty.

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:26.115
- Fishes?
- Fishes?

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.952
What sort of name is that?

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:30.952
Fishes, Dad.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:33.759
All right, then,
we'll call him Fishes.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.276
Not a very good name,
though, that, Fishes.

01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.874
You're gonna have
to look after him, now.

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:43.710
Mrs. Crawley, she likes you.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.030
Thinks you're a fucking good 'un.
She said so.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.390
Tell you summat, Ty,
I wish I did go to school.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.798
I really do.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.038
Dad...

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.509
Is the world really flat?

01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:12.920
I don't fucking know
is the truth, mush.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.231
Gotta work this out
for yourself.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:25.399
I'm not gonna see you for a while.
I want you to be strong.

01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:29.032
This is for you, okay?

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:35.479
You keep this.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.710
Things are gonna
be different now, Ty.

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:40.633
You understand?
Yeah?

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:42.790
Look after your mammy...

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.836
and do what she says.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.433
And you look after your sister.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:50.149
I'm relying on you now, Ty.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:51.992
I always knew I could.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.390
It's all right, Ty.
It's all right.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.517
No crying,
not in front of them.

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:00.954
Look at me.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.677
I'm sorry, Ty.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.591
I love you so much.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.678
You're gonna have to be a man now.

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:13.908
You hear me?

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.191
You're the king now,
my son.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.551
Now, Tyson...

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.598
We're Cutlers.
We gelling.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.593
You ready?

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.436
You ready?

01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.717
The gavvas can't think
they've beaten us, no way.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:41.319
Don't be scared, mush.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:44.517
I've got you, all right?
All right?

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.955
- We're gonna do this?
- Yeah.

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.518
On three, okay?

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.598
No, no!

01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:55.908
One...

01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.908
two...

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:02.108
...three!
