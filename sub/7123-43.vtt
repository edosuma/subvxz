<i>Yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo yoo</i>

00:47.297 --> 00:51.848
Wow. That was really something.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.530
Really something.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.733
- Sure, I'll hold.
- Thank you for your time.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.776
Hello? I'd like to take a
few minutes of your time

01:07.818 --> 01:10.571
to tell you about an amazing
vitamin supplement.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.577
But first, just let me ask you,

01:12.656 --> 01:15.250
do you ever feel that
no matter what you eat,

01:15.325 --> 01:17.828
you're still tired
and sluggish and...

01:19.204 --> 01:21.502
Filled with nagging
anxiety and doubt and...

01:22.916 --> 01:26.716
Root Beer Guy, get your
head back in the game!

01:26.795 --> 01:29.969
Hello, ma'am. I'd like to take
a few minutes of your time...

01:30.048 --> 01:31.595
Hello?

01:31.675 --> 01:34.144
What we need is to cut
out the middle man.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.062
- Hey, Root Beer Guy.
- Hey.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.982
Dude, we should start
our own place.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.274
Next stop, Lollipop
Park Estates.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.076
This is good. What is this?

01:53.155 --> 01:54.452
Candy.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.750
Hmm.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.955
Oh, I've got a closing argument
tomorrow, Root Beer Guy.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.761
<i>I knew there was trouble,.</i>

02:11.840 --> 02:13.638
<i>I could smell it on the
hot evening breeze.</i>

02:13.717 --> 02:16.641
<i>Fortunately for me, trouble
is my favorite thing</i>

02:16.720 --> 02:18.848
<i>because I'm Joe Milkshake.</i>

02:18.930 --> 02:22.150
<i>I kicked down the door with
one swift, decisive motion.</i>

02:22.225 --> 02:24.569
No.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.238
<i>With one swift and
decisive motion,</i>

02:26.313 --> 02:27.986
<i>I kicked down the door.</i>

02:28.065 --> 02:29.362
No.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.489
<i>"The door was kicked
down by me swiftly</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:33.491
<i>with not many motions</i>

02:33.570 --> 02:37.245
<i>but a whole lot of
decisiveness was used by me</i>

02:37.324 --> 02:38.826
<i>that was apparent to everybody."</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:41.332
Ugh.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.000
Aaaaaaaaaah!

02:46.083 --> 02:47.926
Hmm.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.924
What are you doing?!

02:50.003 --> 02:51.801
Let me go!

02:51.880 --> 02:54.178
No!

02:54.257 --> 02:56.055
Yeah!

03:04.476 --> 03:06.854
- Hey. Hey, are you awake?
- Not really.

03:06.937 --> 03:08.735
Well, this is gonna sound crazy,

03:08.814 --> 03:11.408
but I think I saw Princess
Bubblegum get kidnapped,

03:11.483 --> 03:14.362
and the perpetrators
were that Finn and Jake.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.661
Okay, sweetie.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.956
That sounds like an
interesting dream.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.875
But it <i>did</i> happen.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.332
You need to eat something
before you go to work,

03:27.416 --> 03:29.669
and you can't keep falling
asleep at your typewriter.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.298
It's bad for your back.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.257
Besides, I miss you at night.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.716
I'm sorry, sweetie.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.676
I couldn't stop thinking
about that weird stuff

03:37.759 --> 03:40.888
I saw last night when I was
peeking through the bushes.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.848
Ugh! Peeking through
the bushes?!

03:42.931 --> 03:45.855
You've been warping your mind
with all this mystery stuff.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.312
I swear, sometimes I think
you love that novel of yours

03:48.395 --> 03:49.863
more than you love me.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.440
You've been working on it

03:51.523 --> 03:53.196
every night for 10
years, and for what?!

03:53.275 --> 03:55.277
Look at me, Root Beer Guy!

03:55.360 --> 03:57.328
I'm a cherry cream soda,

03:57.404 --> 04:00.749
and I have the same needs as
any other cherry cream soda

04:00.824 --> 04:05.000
or even diet cream soda!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.001
<i>I didn't know what to say,</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:10.209
<i>but Joe Milkshake never
was a talky guy.</i>

04:10.292 --> 04:11.919
<i>On my way to work that morning,</i>

04:12.002 --> 04:15.097
<i>I decided to lake a second
look at the crime scene.</i>

04:17.382 --> 04:18.382
Hmm.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.110
Lake Butterscotch? Hmm.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.439
Root Beer Guy! Root Beer Guy!

04:31.521 --> 04:32.613
Root Beer Guy!

04:32.689 --> 04:34.612
How many bottles of product
you sell this month?

04:34.691 --> 04:35.613
Zero.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.490
Great! Least you
can count to zero!

04:37.569 --> 04:39.338
You know, maybe if you'd
give me the new leads...

04:39.362 --> 04:41.831
You haven't earned
the new leads.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.973
It's easy to do when you
have all the leads.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.465
- Exactly.
- Hey, Root Beer Guy.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.292
It's all about the leads.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.383
See? I told you!
It's candy stucco.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.055
Stucco feels great.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.224
Hmm. When you're
right, you're right.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.551
All right, you two.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.612
What were you doing last night
with Princess Bubblegum?

05:02.636 --> 05:04.058
- Uh...
- Hmm...

05:04.137 --> 05:05.889
We were home last night. - Yeah.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.724
We were doing that... thing.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.936
That was a great thing
we were doing at home

05:10.018 --> 05:11.361
with no other witnesses.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.063
But we're each
other's witnesses.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.774
- Yeah!
- But I saw you.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.235
Look, man, you
didn't see nothin'.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.159
Hmph!

05:30.455 --> 05:33.004
Mr. Banana Guard, you've
got to arrest those guys!

05:33.083 --> 05:34.175
Come on!

05:34.251 --> 05:36.174
These are the guys!
They're kidnappers!

05:36.253 --> 05:38.005
You have to arrest
them and find out

05:38.088 --> 05:39.715
where they're hiding
Princess Bubblegum.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.051
Princess Bubblegum? She's
right around the corner!

05:42.133 --> 05:43.555
Oh, Princess Bubblegum!

05:43.635 --> 05:45.103
Yes?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.555
I think some banana guards

05:46.638 --> 05:47.981
wish to speak with you.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.854
Where are those banana guards?

05:49.933 --> 05:53.312
- Your highness!
- Greetings, your majesty!

05:53.395 --> 05:56.114
Your skin is looking
lovely today.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.566
Oh, thanks!

05:57.649 --> 05:59.401
It's really, really orange!

05:59.484 --> 06:00.781
Ugh!

06:00.861 --> 06:04.286
I've been using this new,
uh, marmalade spray-on tan.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.364
Yeah. Cinnamon Bun...

06:05.407 --> 06:07.705
<i>Bingo-bango.</i>

06:07.784 --> 06:09.707
<i>This was my lucky break.</i>

06:12.289 --> 06:17.170
<i>With one decisive motion,
I kicked down the door.</i>

06:17.252 --> 06:20.131
So, uh, being tan
is my thing now.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.432
Quickly, I scanned
the room for the...

06:22.507 --> 06:24.225
Oh, man.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.306
"Caramel Court,"

06:26.386 --> 06:27.512
"Cotton Candy Crescent."

06:29.180 --> 06:32.059
"Lollipop Park Estates"...
Bingo-bang...

06:32.142 --> 06:34.236
Aha! Huh?

06:39.441 --> 06:42.069
<i>Bingo-bango.</i>

06:46.615 --> 06:47.867
Bonsoir, monsieur.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.747
Would you like me to
turn down the bed?

06:49.826 --> 06:51.499
Uh, look what I've got.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.330
The security tape will show

06:53.413 --> 06:55.757
that Finn and Jake kidnapped
Princess Bubblegum.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.426
Finn and Jake would
never do that!

06:58.501 --> 07:01.129
Oh, yeah? Prepare to
have your mind blown...

07:01.212 --> 07:03.135
after I put this
tape in the VCR,

07:03.214 --> 07:05.262
just to make sure I
got the right one.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.595
I'm pretty sure I did!

07:09.471 --> 07:10.643
Hey, yes! This is it!

07:10.722 --> 07:13.271
- Aaaaaaaaaah!
- Bingo-bango!

07:13.350 --> 07:15.478
I've got to get to the...

07:15.560 --> 07:19.030
Are you in the tub, sweetie?
I'm going out!

07:19.105 --> 07:21.483
I've got to get this tape
to the banana guards

07:21.566 --> 07:24.661
or the newspaper or maybe the D.A.
or something.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.955
Hey, Root Beer Guy.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.954
You were not supposed
to view this tape.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.956
But... but how did
you guys know'?

07:32.035 --> 07:33.537
I told them.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.964
That's right. I did it for us!

07:36.039 --> 07:39.213
Oh, this thing is eating
you alive, Root Beer Guy!

07:39.292 --> 07:40.919
But it's all I've got.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.764
Hey, this looks
kind of personal.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.307
Hmph.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.820
Mr. Pudding...

08:06.903 --> 08:08.496
Oh, you can just call me "Buck."

08:08.571 --> 08:09.823
Uh, Buck, those...

08:09.906 --> 08:11.704
No need to be formal here, son.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.160
Those guys who were
just in here...

08:13.243 --> 08:14.745
Can you tell me
what they bought?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.751
Well, let's see...

08:16.830 --> 08:19.709
A shovel, a saw,
some plastic bags,

08:19.791 --> 08:24.171
some duct tape, a bludgeon,
a mop, rubber gloves.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.302
Say, Mr.... Buck, do
you know anything

08:26.381 --> 08:28.304
about this Lake Butterscotch?

08:28.383 --> 08:31.182
Right nice spot,
Lake Butterscotch...

08:31.261 --> 08:33.639
Miles from where anyone
could hear a person scream,

08:33.722 --> 08:36.145
if a person were screaming
for some reason.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.976
Creepy now that I
think about it.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.312
Nothing up there these days
but some abandoned cabins.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.318
Nice place to hide a body

08:42.397 --> 08:44.445
if you were into
that sort of thing.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.027
Son, now, what are you
doing in my pickup truck'?

09:09.382 --> 09:11.009
- Yeah?
- Don't hang up!

09:11.092 --> 09:12.514
I'm Root Beer Guy.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.155
I'm the guy who kidnapped
Princess Bubblegum.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.990
Yeah, yeah. I wrapped her
in a carpet... yeah...

09:16.014 --> 09:17.734
And I'm gonna dump her
in Lake Butterscotch!

09:17.766 --> 09:19.313
I'm completely insane!

09:20.769 --> 09:22.612
But you still have
time to stop me.

09:22.687 --> 09:26.692
Get up to Lake Butterscotch
right now, Banana Guard.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.244
And I took a boat
out after 8:00.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.867
Emergency!

09:31.946 --> 09:35.075
- Quickly, to Lake Butterscotch!
- Wee-ooo! Wee...

09:36.701 --> 09:39.375
Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!

09:39.454 --> 09:41.081
Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!

09:41.164 --> 09:42.541
Ugh!

09:42.624 --> 09:44.501
Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo! Wee-ooo!

09:44.584 --> 09:47.212
Use the licorice lace lasso!

09:48.755 --> 09:50.928
Whoa!

09:51.007 --> 09:52.805
Oh, my word! Get those guys!

09:52.884 --> 09:54.511
They're my accomplices!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.722
- Oh. Okay.
- I got it!

09:58.098 --> 09:59.771
Busted, you boat crimer.

10:01.976 --> 10:02.898
It's...

10:02.977 --> 10:04.570
Finn and Jake?!

10:04.646 --> 10:06.364
Well, guys...

10:06.439 --> 10:08.692
it looks like you caught us.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.244
Okay, Princess. You
can come out now.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.705
Princess!

10:17.784 --> 10:21.334
Oh, yeah. It is the princess.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.129
Congratulations!

10:25.208 --> 10:26.630
Whee! Whee!

10:26.709 --> 10:29.508
You were so good at
solving the case.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.134
Um, what case'?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.887
The fake kidnapping.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.344
To test the Candy Kingdom's
security system?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.099
We didn't solve that case.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.682
But if you weren't following
the clues I left, who was?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.859
Um... it's Root Beer Guy.

10:42.934 --> 10:46.029
Then why the Jumping Jay
is he in handcuffs?!

10:46.104 --> 10:47.777
Uh, he went boating.
