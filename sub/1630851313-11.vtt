MIGUEL:
Ah, relax, baby.

00:17.518 --> 00:18.592
It's gonna be great.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.702
Yeah, but where is she?

00:20.763 --> 00:22.429
Her entire court is waiting.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.582
Well, you know your daughter.
She likes to make an entrance.

00:25.601 --> 00:28.101
(sighs) Right.
And I know her<i> papi,</i> too,

00:28.195 --> 00:30.487
who likes to make a big show
out of everything.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.367
Miguel, What did you do?

00:44.361 --> 00:47.621
-(speaks Spanish)
-(both laugh)

00:47.773 --> 00:48.939
(sighs)

and a little me.

MIGUEL:
Baby, it's fine. Look.

01:12.298 --> 01:16.224
There's four ropes, and, no,
nothing's gonna happen.

01:16.318 --> 01:18.285
Ay...

01:20.397 --> 01:21.580
(sighs)

01:21.807 --> 01:23.749
She looks beautiful.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.900
Lourdes!<i> Mija!</i>

01:25.994 --> 01:28.736
You look beautiful.

01:28.831 --> 01:30.831
MIGUEL:

01:30.999 --> 01:32.332
You really do.

-Hey.

02:03.940 --> 02:05.031
The country club said

02:05.126 --> 02:06.291
the building's
been vacant for repairs.

02:06.443 --> 02:08.018
That's why nobody
heard him hit the roof.

02:08.187 --> 02:09.277
-Do you know when this happened?
-No.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.796
I saw a crew up there
this morning.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.189
So, no more than a few hours.
All right.

02:12.282 --> 02:14.967
-Keep everybody back.
-(speaks Spanish)

02:16.528 --> 02:18.428
Got your med kit?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.515
Not my first rodeo.

02:24.703 --> 02:26.812
<i> Mija,</i> this is terrible.
The party's ruined.

02:26.963 --> 02:28.129
Are you kidding, Mom?

02:28.149 --> 02:29.964
This is awesome.

02:30.042 --> 02:31.132
JUDITH: Really?

02:31.226 --> 02:32.818
Jonah, Hen, you take the roof.

02:32.969 --> 02:34.060
Buck, we're gonna come at him
on the inside.

02:34.213 --> 02:36.062
Ericson, you're up top
on the assist.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.732
All right. Up we go, Monday.

02:38.884 --> 02:41.051
Name's Jonah, and you know that.

02:41.144 --> 02:42.995
Why do you keep
calling me Monday?

02:43.222 --> 02:45.647
'Cause there's a new one of you
every shift.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.908
To me, you're Monday.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.318
He went clear through the roof.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.580
Sir? Sir? Can you hear me?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.323
-(groaning)
-I got a pulse.

02:55.401 --> 02:56.491
Please...

02:56.585 --> 02:58.177
-help me.
-Easy. Don't move.
You don't want

02:58.253 --> 03:00.070
-to exacerbate your injuries.
-What's your name?

03:00.163 --> 03:02.330
-Lenny.
-JONAH: Paragliding?
What happened?

03:02.349 --> 03:05.017
LENNY: Wind picked up.
Tried to avoid some...

03:05.244 --> 03:06.910
power lines and lost control.

03:06.929 --> 03:10.171
Pulse is 130. BP's 105/60.

03:11.266 --> 03:13.099
Breathing is fast,
but his lungs sound clear.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.251
JONAH:
Opening a line.

03:14.269 --> 03:16.195
Pushing ten of morphine.

03:16.422 --> 03:18.680
Hang in there, Lenny. I'm giving
you some of the good stuff.

03:18.774 --> 03:21.258
-Pretty soon,
you won't feel a thing.
-Already can't feel my legs.

03:21.351 --> 03:24.578
Lenny, can you wiggle
your fingers for me.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.690
-How about this?
Can-can you feel that? Okay.
-Yeah.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.116
JONAH:
Lumbar injury?

03:30.269 --> 03:32.026
-Spinal compression?
-HEN: Possibly.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.287
What if my legs
are completely gone?

03:34.440 --> 03:36.106
Don't worry. Don't think
you'd be talking to us at all.

03:36.199 --> 03:38.442
We'll have a visual
soon enough, okay? Cap.

03:38.535 --> 03:41.428
-How we looking down there?
-Almost in position.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.875
Uh, hey, Cap, I don't want
to be insensitive, but, uh,

03:47.970 --> 03:50.395
do his legs look really short?

03:51.398 --> 03:53.398
Oh...

03:57.296 --> 03:59.988
Hen, Jonah,
get down here right now.

04:03.986 --> 04:06.245
HEN:
Bilateral open knee dislocation.

04:06.472 --> 04:08.914
The impact forced the femurs
down through the knee.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.732
Landed on his feet,

04:10.826 --> 04:12.066
and his upper legs kept going.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.752
Thinking it's better now
that he can't feel them.

04:13.903 --> 04:16.313
Blood loss isn't that bad,
considering.

04:16.331 --> 04:18.315
Lucky he didn't sever
his femoral arteries.

04:18.408 --> 04:19.816
-Do we reset them here?
-HEN: Absolutely not.

04:19.909 --> 04:21.485
You know better
than to attempt that

04:21.503 --> 04:23.929
-out in the field.
-I heard you like
to push the envelope.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.672
Something about having
your hand inside of a guy's

04:25.766 --> 04:29.083
-torso for two hours?
-That's an entirely
different envelope. Grab

04:29.103 --> 04:30.602
the splints.

04:30.754 --> 04:31.995
<i> Ready for extraction, Cap.</i>

04:32.014 --> 04:33.847
All right, Lenny, you stay calm.

04:33.999 --> 04:36.316
Things are gonna
get a little noisy.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.648
Ah, it should be ready soon.
How'd it go?

05:16.800 --> 05:18.058
Well, not too bad for me.

05:18.210 --> 05:19.392
The 153 is the target
of choice this time around.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.320
HARRY: I don't understand
why they make you go

05:21.471 --> 05:23.730
to those meetings.
Don't you write down everything

05:23.824 --> 05:25.139
that happens
while you're at work?

05:25.159 --> 05:27.141
Well, they like to ask
follow-up questions like,

05:27.161 --> 05:28.885
"Why did it take you
nine minutes

05:28.978 --> 05:30.162
to respond to that call?"

05:30.313 --> 05:31.905
Or, "Why'd you stay
at the scene so long?"

05:31.999 --> 05:33.557
Or, "Why have you
still not filled

05:33.575 --> 05:35.149
those empty slots
in your company roster?"

05:35.243 --> 05:36.743
HARRY: Sounds like your bosses

05:36.837 --> 05:38.170
get you all dressed up
to meet up with you

05:38.321 --> 05:39.896
so they can tell you
that you suck.

05:39.915 --> 05:41.298
Pretty much.

05:42.234 --> 05:43.083
You do those, too, Mom?

05:43.235 --> 05:45.326
No. For which I am grateful

05:45.346 --> 05:47.829
because I have seen grown men
throwing up

05:47.848 --> 05:49.014
in trash cans after coming out

05:49.165 --> 05:51.091

05:54.930 --> 05:56.763
Eddie's slots.
Turns out I've put it off

05:56.915 --> 05:57.747
for as long as I can.

05:57.766 --> 05:59.507
Well, you know the rules.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.917
No homework at the table.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.194
Well, I have to change anyways,
so I'll just put them

06:02.345 --> 06:03.845
in the bedroom
and read them later.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.680
Well, so much
for a relaxing bedtime.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.092
-Sorry I'm late.
-You're not late.

06:09.261 --> 06:10.685
We're gonna sit down
as soon as I change.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.019
Oh, great.

06:12.114 --> 06:14.021
I want to hear
all about work over dinner.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.541

-Me, too.

when I was Fire Marshal Buck.

10:24.273 --> 10:27.274

-Buck,

Huh...

10:54.303 --> 10:56.303
-You're back.
-Cap asked me to fill in again.

of a "Tuesday," don't you?

11:01.903 --> 11:04.311

wh-what are you doing?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.331
Uh, making room

11:10.504 --> 11:12.912
After 13 years in the same
firehouse, why would I know

11:13.064 --> 11:15.840
-what supplies we need?
-I'm just doing
what Cap asked me.

11:15.992 --> 11:18.826
You keep calling him Cap.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.904
Why? What do you call him?

11:20.997 --> 11:22.922
Do you have daily nicknames
for him, too?

11:23.074 --> 11:24.908
Is it what he makes for lunch?
Today he's gazpacho?

11:24.926 --> 11:27.168
He's not your cap.

into today's roster.

11:41.017 --> 11:42.200
Well, I-I didn't agree to that.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.927
And yet it happened anyway.

11:43.945 --> 11:45.352
That's what I'm here
to talk about.

-W...

not coming back to the 118?

11:53.621 --> 11:56.122
-I suspected as much
when he asked for a transfer.
-I know,

31:15.933 --> 31:17.857
You're a terrible liar.

31:17.935 --> 31:19.784
She's gonna
figure it out anyway.

31:19.937 --> 31:21.786
Okay, you're making me nauseous.

31:21.939 --> 31:23.196
I'm gonna need you
to pick a side.

31:23.290 --> 31:26.942
Honesty.
Honesty is the best policy.

31:26.960 --> 31:31.346
Also, it's the easiest
to remember.

31:35.802 --> 31:38.211
What are you doing?

31:38.230 --> 31:42.107
Hey, buddy.
Sorry. Did I wake you?

31:42.884 --> 31:44.884
I don't know.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.811
Why are you awake?

31:46.888 --> 31:50.649
I guess I'm just not used
to the nine-to-five life yet.

31:50.801 --> 31:54.302
Body's still on
the 24-hour shifts now and then.

31:54.471 --> 31:57.748
That doesn't make any sense.

31:57.899 --> 32:00.158
Hmm.

32:00.310 --> 32:01.826
No?

32:01.921 --> 32:04.028
All right then, Doctor,

32:04.181 --> 32:06.089
what's your diagnosis?

32:06.316 --> 32:09.718
You miss being a firefighter.

32:11.004 --> 32:13.347
You're right.

32:16.009 --> 32:17.676
I guess I do.

32:17.828 --> 32:19.844
So why'd you stop?

32:19.997 --> 32:21.513
I thought you wanted me to stop.

32:21.665 --> 32:23.014
I never said that.

32:23.167 --> 32:25.758
You said it was scary
for you, Chris.

32:25.852 --> 32:27.836
It is, sometimes.

32:27.929 --> 32:30.188
But you are really brave,

32:30.340 --> 32:33.158
and I can be brave, too.

32:40.534 --> 32:42.459
-You don't belong here!
-I lived here first! I didn't

32:42.536 --> 32:44.444
-ask you to show up.
-WILLIAMS: Let's just...
Everyone, just

32:44.463 --> 32:46.296
-calm down. Sir. I...
-MAN 2: Calm down? You don't

32:46.448 --> 32:48.523
have to live here. You don't
have to see this every day.

32:48.542 --> 32:51.193
-Sergeant Grant!
-What's the disturbance?

32:51.211 --> 32:53.195
-He is. Look at all this crap.
-It's not...

32:53.288 --> 32:55.864
-He won't clean it up.
-It's not crap.
It's my property.

32:55.882 --> 32:58.291
Every morning I look out
my window, and this is my view.

32:58.385 --> 33:00.385
It's unsanitary
and it's unsightly.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.312
-Those words are subjective,
right?
-(laughs) Oh.

33:02.464 --> 33:04.889
Huh. That family just listed
way below comps

33:04.984 --> 33:06.984
to get away
from this creep's junkyard.

33:07.135 --> 33:10.212
That's not subjective.
He's hurting my wallet.

33:10.305 --> 33:12.731
So far, what I'm hearing
is a complaint to the city,

33:12.883 --> 33:14.232
not a reason to call 911.

33:14.326 --> 33:16.568
They didn't call. I did. Okay,

33:16.662 --> 33:17.828
these people are trespassing.

33:17.904 --> 33:19.145
They've been stealing
my property.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.980
-They are harassing me.
-Your property?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.649
You fished half this junk
out of our trash!

33:23.669 --> 33:25.151
No! Oh! (gasps)

33:25.245 --> 33:27.562
It's only junk if it's not
useful, which all of this is.

33:27.655 --> 33:28.897
Okay, do you have any idea

33:28.990 --> 33:30.823
how hard it is
to find diodes like these?

33:30.992 --> 33:32.342
Oh, I'll put 'em somewhere

33:32.569 --> 33:34.402
-you'll be able to find 'em!
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

33:34.404 --> 33:35.846
-Hey.
-ATHENA: All right,
all right. Enough.

33:36.073 --> 33:37.389
-Get back.
-Both of you, to your corners.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.408
-I'm watching you.
-Oh,

33:40.427 --> 33:41.926
is that a threat?
He threatened me. That's right.

33:42.079 --> 33:43.186
-All right, we...
-You heard him.

33:43.338 --> 33:45.004
-He threatened me.
-We have plenty of room

33:45.024 --> 33:46.189
in the back of that car
for the both of you.

33:46.382 --> 33:47.916
I...

33:48.009 --> 33:49.693
Williams,
start taking statements.

33:49.770 --> 33:52.195
-I'll be right back.
-What? No. Where are you...?

33:52.364 --> 33:54.013
-Where's she going?
-WILLIAMS: She'll be back.

33:54.107 --> 33:55.924
-Just stay right there.
-Sergeant Grant.

33:55.926 --> 33:57.701
I heard you're
moving in a hurry.

33:57.928 --> 33:59.519
Is that because
of the car bomber?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.780
That man knew where we lived.
He's still out there.

34:01.932 --> 34:04.766
We'll just feel safer
someplace else.

34:04.859 --> 34:06.618
Even if it is
at my mother-in-law's.

34:06.770 --> 34:08.770
Oh. On her invitation?

34:08.863 --> 34:10.438
I took your advice.

34:10.532 --> 34:13.275
All I needed to do was just
reach out and ask her for help,

34:13.293 --> 34:16.970
and... now she loves me.

34:18.131 --> 34:19.556
You're here for Trashcan Kurt?

34:19.725 --> 34:24.119
Well, he doesn't seems to be too
well-liked around these parts.

34:24.137 --> 34:26.546
We have tried.
We've even offered to clean up,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.306
but he just refuses.

34:28.458 --> 34:30.883
My husband even filed
for a court order

34:30.903 --> 34:32.961
to force him to clean up.

34:32.979 --> 34:34.554
ATHENA:
Oh, yeah? How'd that go?

34:34.573 --> 34:36.464
We didn't even make it to court.
I just...

34:36.483 --> 34:38.909
With everything
that's gone on, it's...

34:39.136 --> 34:40.726
It just didn't
feel important anymore.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.304
So you dropped the court order?

34:42.397 --> 34:45.898
The man who called you
about the bomb--

34:45.992 --> 34:48.234
you said he knew things
about you.

34:48.253 --> 34:52.738
Yeah. He said
he knew our kids' names,

34:52.833 --> 34:55.150
what my husband did
for a living.

34:55.168 --> 34:59.245
It was like he was watching us
the whole time.

34:59.339 --> 35:03.007
Like he was right outside
your house, looking in?

35:03.160 --> 35:06.269
ERICA:
That's what he said--
"I'm watching you."

35:07.331 --> 35:11.441
Go inside
and lock all the doors, now.

35:12.260 --> 35:16.004
This is 727-L-30
requesting immediate backup

35:16.022 --> 35:17.689
at 573 Dunham Lane.

35:17.783 --> 35:21.100
Possible bombing suspect.
Pursuing him into his home.

35:21.194 --> 35:23.436
You two! Get inside.
Williams,

35:23.455 --> 35:26.123
go around back,
keep an eye out for trip wires.

35:26.350 --> 35:28.792
Who knows what
he's got cooked up in there.

35:28.943 --> 35:31.503
Everyone, back in your homes!

35:36.135 --> 35:37.359
Sir!

35:37.469 --> 35:39.878
This is the LAPD.
If you do not open this door,

35:39.972 --> 35:42.347
we are coming in.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.294
(sighs)

36:24.349 --> 36:26.057
(gasps)

36:29.855 --> 36:32.397
(rat squeaking)

36:53.712 --> 36:55.337
-(grunts)
-(grunts)

36:59.867 --> 37:03.278
Dispatch, this is 727-L-30.

37:03.371 --> 37:06.556
We need a RA unit. He may have
sustained minor injuries.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.726
Bomber suspect is in custody.

37:16.884 --> 37:19.027
<i> (doorbell rings)</i>

37:20.722 --> 37:22.054
-Eddie.
-Hey, Bobby.

37:22.074 --> 37:23.798
Sorry for showing up
out of the blue.

37:23.817 --> 37:25.817
I wanted to talk to you
before you started your shift.

37:25.969 --> 37:29.895
Always happy to see you.
Come on in.

37:30.064 --> 37:32.898
All right.
What did you want to talk about?

37:33.067 --> 37:36.419
My request to transfer back
to the 118.

37:39.741 --> 37:41.073
Okay, what's going on?

37:41.167 --> 37:44.910
Nothing. I realized
I made a mistake,

37:44.930 --> 37:46.912
and I want to fix that.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.506
I'm ready to come home.

37:48.658 --> 37:51.751
We talked about this
before you left.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.252
(laughs)
I know, I know.

37:53.346 --> 37:55.921
You tried to talk me out of it.
Uh, you were right.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.348
It isn't about
being right, Eddie.

37:57.501 --> 37:59.109
I just want to understand
what's changed.

37:59.278 --> 38:01.260
It wasn't three months ago
you asked to transfer out,

38:01.280 --> 38:02.687
now you want back in.

38:02.764 --> 38:03.838
Christopher was struggling.

38:03.857 --> 38:05.840
He wasn't the only one.

38:05.859 --> 38:07.859
You said that.

38:08.011 --> 38:09.286
I agreed to a transfer,

38:09.513 --> 38:11.195
we found you a spot at dispatch,
but you don't seem better.

38:11.348 --> 38:12.289
Are you sleeping at all?

38:12.440 --> 38:14.958
(sighs)
It's been a rough few months.

38:15.109 --> 38:18.878
I don't think I...
gelled there, yeah.

38:20.114 --> 38:22.281
I remember when I first
went on medical leave.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.542
It was like
all the noise outside stopped,

38:24.694 --> 38:27.211
but the noise
inside my head got louder.

38:27.364 --> 38:30.289
I think, sometimes,
the life we lead,

38:30.458 --> 38:33.810
the hours we keep, our focus
on other's well-being--

38:33.961 --> 38:36.204
we wind up ignoring our own.

38:36.222 --> 38:38.464
That's not
what's happening here.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.650
I... I'll be fine.

38:40.802 --> 38:42.727
Once I'm back on the job.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.364
I think that might need
to wait a little while.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.237
You're saying no?

38:53.390 --> 38:55.147
-Is this punishment for leaving?
-No.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.316
This is concern.
I'm not saying never.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.077
But for your sake
and the sake of the team,

38:59.229 --> 39:00.986
I can't have you back
the way you are right now.

39:01.006 --> 39:04.824
You need to go talk to someone,
work out whatever's going on.

39:04.843 --> 39:05.675
I don't need
a mental health check.

39:05.902 --> 39:08.828
Just need my job back.

39:08.922 --> 39:11.014
You've known me
long enough to know

39:11.165 --> 39:13.224
those things go hand in hand.

39:17.672 --> 39:19.581
I can go to another house.

39:20.341 --> 39:23.101
Well, you better hope they don't
call me for a recommendation.

39:23.195 --> 39:27.179
(sighs) You know, when the brass
was coming for you,

39:27.273 --> 39:29.849
when they were trying
to fire you, I had your back.

39:29.943 --> 39:31.517
I supported you, and now
you're trying to turn on me?

39:31.536 --> 39:33.111
Eddie, that's not
what's going on here.

39:33.263 --> 39:34.871
-I'm looking out for you.
-You're gonna stand there

39:35.098 --> 39:36.873
with a hundred-something
bodies on you

39:37.100 --> 39:39.459
and tell me
I'm not fit for duty?

39:41.529 --> 39:42.712
Go to hell, Bobby.

39:42.939 --> 39:45.048
(door opens)

39:45.199 --> 39:47.258
(door closes)

39:55.894 --> 39:58.636
(Taylor humming)

39:58.730 --> 40:01.472
Uh, hey.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.716
Hey.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.384
Can we talk?

40:05.478 --> 40:07.570
Okay. Yeah.

40:07.722 --> 40:10.055
Just, um, give me one minute.

40:10.191 --> 40:12.242
It's, uh, it's-it's important.

40:12.393 --> 40:14.285
Okay.

40:15.062 --> 40:17.229
Everything all right?

40:17.307 --> 40:20.125
You look like
you're about to throw up.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.812
Oh.

40:24.906 --> 40:28.149
Uh, um...

40:28.168 --> 40:32.320
th-things have-have been great

40:32.338 --> 40:33.596
with us.

40:33.823 --> 40:34.914
Or real-really great.

40:35.008 --> 40:37.325
Uh, this is easily the most

40:37.343 --> 40:40.770
functional relationship
I-I've ever been in.

40:40.922 --> 40:42.755
Well, careful
with the sweet talk.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.107
It might go to my head.

40:44.258 --> 40:47.593
I-I just... I-I want to say
that I-I love you.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.612
And-and I do,

40:49.764 --> 40:52.097
and I-I would never

40:52.192 --> 40:56.268
intentionally do anything
to hurt you.

40:56.346 --> 40:59.164
Spit it out, Buckley.

41:02.869 --> 41:05.211
Uh...

41:07.207 --> 41:10.783
I-I think-I think
you should move in with me.

41:10.877 --> 41:12.635
(laughs)
<i> -HEN: You did</i>

41:12.787 --> 41:15.788
what?!
-I know, okay?
I-I... I panicked.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.884
I was gonna tell her,
but she looked so... pre-hurt.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.644
I had to say something else.

41:21.796 --> 41:23.204
And what did she say?

41:23.297 --> 41:25.815
Well, she was surprised,
and, uh...

41:25.967 --> 41:27.299
and then, she-she said yes.

41:27.393 --> 41:29.711
And now the two of you
are living together?

41:29.729 --> 41:31.379
Well, not for a few weeks.

41:31.397 --> 41:34.306
Uh, she-she's got to pack
and get out of her lease.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.734
Are you familiar with the term
"out of the frying pan

41:36.828 --> 41:38.219
and into the fire"?

41:38.238 --> 41:39.737
Come on. It's-it's
gonna be fine, all right?

41:39.889 --> 41:41.981
Taylor and I already
spend all our time together.

41:42.075 --> 41:43.500
What's the difference?

41:43.651 --> 41:46.227
Buck, a relationship changes
when suddenly neither of you has

41:46.246 --> 41:48.320
your own place
to run to, especially

41:48.414 --> 41:50.173
when there's something
you're running from.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.658
I'm not running
from anything, okay?

41:52.677 --> 41:56.571
I... I love Taylor.

41:56.589 --> 41:57.997
And Lucy?

41:58.016 --> 42:00.183
I don't ever have
to see her again.

42:00.334 --> 42:02.185
Everybody upstairs.
Rundown in five.

42:02.336 --> 42:04.503
I've got some
announcements to make.

42:05.339 --> 42:06.764
RAVI:
Hey, what was the deal
with Eddie

42:06.858 --> 42:09.359
-at the bar the other night?
-He was there? I didn't see him.

42:09.586 --> 42:11.269
I texted him. I just...
I thought he was a no-show.

42:11.421 --> 42:13.029
Well, I saw him
in the parking lot,

42:13.214 --> 42:15.681
-and he just kind of
blew me off.
-Weird.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.200
-Yeah.
-Wonder what's going on.

42:17.351 --> 42:21.112
Why do I get the feeling that
man is one of the announcements?

42:21.264 --> 42:24.207
BOBBY:
Morning, everyone.
As you all know,

42:24.434 --> 42:26.525
we've been two people light
these last few months.

42:26.619 --> 42:28.102
We've had some great people
fill in, but I think

42:28.121 --> 42:29.937
it's time
to stop the revolving door.

42:30.031 --> 42:32.031
You all know Jonah.
He's been with us

42:32.125 --> 42:33.883
for a few shifts.
He's done an excellent job.

42:34.035 --> 42:36.368
And he'll be our new paramedic.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.946
(quietly): Damn it.
-JONAH: Thanks, Captain.

42:38.965 --> 42:40.448
I'm really happy to be here

42:40.466 --> 42:41.891
-and be a part of the team.
-Doesn't seem so bad.

42:42.118 --> 42:43.801
He'll probably be
a good partner.

42:43.953 --> 42:46.287
What are you doing right now?

42:46.380 --> 42:48.306
BUCK:
I-I'm looking
on the bright side,

42:48.400 --> 42:50.108
trying to be a better Buck.

42:51.052 --> 42:53.127
Well, stop it.

42:53.146 --> 42:54.645
Who's gonna be the other one?

42:54.739 --> 42:57.315
Someone you also know,
just not as well.
