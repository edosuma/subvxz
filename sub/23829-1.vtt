[Gunshots]

01:22.531 --> 01:24.064
I can't thank you enough

01:24.066 --> 01:27.001
for getting us
the rent money in advance.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.636
It's for the best,
you know.

01:29.638 --> 01:31.204
We're going to be
with my mother

01:31.206 --> 01:33.339
for the last couple
of weeks of her life,

01:33.341 --> 01:36.510
and then she's gonna
be at peace.

01:36.512 --> 01:38.511
I just wish there was
more I could do,

01:38.513 --> 01:40.648
but you know how it is
with graduation right now.

01:40.650 --> 01:43.183
No, no, no. You've done more
than enough for us here.

01:43.185 --> 01:46.020
You've been like
a daughter to me

01:46.022 --> 01:48.121
the last couple of years
that you lived here,

01:48.123 --> 01:51.525
especially since Bill and I
have no children of our own.

01:51.527 --> 01:53.359
Everything's ready.

01:53.361 --> 01:55.094
Do you need me
to get anything else?

01:55.096 --> 01:57.665
Yeah, could you go out back
and get that cooler

01:57.667 --> 01:59.400
and fill it with ice
before we leave?

01:59.402 --> 02:00.668
I already packed that up.

02:00.670 --> 02:02.568
I guess that's
everything we need, then.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.539
Okay.

02:06.676 --> 02:09.542
Okay, now, the number
to my mother's house

02:09.544 --> 02:11.044
is up on the refrigerator

02:11.045 --> 02:12.613
just in case you need
anything at all.

02:12.615 --> 02:14.681
- Okay, thanks.
- And we're going to try

02:14.683 --> 02:16.215
to get back
for your graduation,

02:16.217 --> 02:17.550
- I promise.
- Really?

02:17.552 --> 02:19.386
I'd love that so much.

02:19.388 --> 02:21.054
All right, you take care.

02:21.056 --> 02:24.391
You, too.
Drive safely.

02:24.393 --> 02:25.562
Bye!

02:34.402 --> 02:37.306
[Woman] Oh, Bill, you
just killed that tree.

03:57.686 --> 03:59.153
It's a 13 page essay?

03:59.155 --> 04:01.488
Yeah, no more
than 15 pages, Rachel.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.489
Okay. Thanks, Professor.

04:03.491 --> 04:05.491
- Oh, no problem. Have a good day.
- Thanks.

04:05.493 --> 04:07.293
- See you in class tomorrow.
- Thank you.

04:07.295 --> 04:08.364
See you tomorrow.

04:15.570 --> 04:16.803
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.505
How did you do
on the exam today?

04:18.507 --> 04:20.339
Finished early.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.642
Figured we'd get a head start
on our next mock case.

04:22.644 --> 04:24.777
Still trying to wrap my head
around the last one.

04:24.779 --> 04:26.346
I know. We only have
two weeks.

04:26.348 --> 04:28.248
[Man]
A slave named Deborah.

04:28.250 --> 04:32.185
See, here's the thing,
good buddy.

04:32.187 --> 04:34.687
I, A, need your story
on the record.

04:34.689 --> 04:36.223
Since you're just
one case away

04:36.225 --> 04:37.356
from being kicked off,

04:37.358 --> 04:39.192
your story
has to be massaged

04:39.194 --> 04:40.726
to fit within
certain parameters,

04:40.728 --> 04:42.829
are you with me?

04:42.831 --> 04:44.498
Law is the law,

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
and the fact is even
child-molesting murderers

04:46.502 --> 04:48.502
have the right to hospital
care and a lawyer,

04:48.504 --> 04:50.370
neither of which he got,

04:50.372 --> 04:54.173
because he arrived D.O.A.
thank you very much.

04:54.175 --> 04:56.375
We'll see it probably
in the news.

04:56.377 --> 04:57.711
But as of now, my friend,

04:57.713 --> 05:00.647
you... you are a hero.

05:00.649 --> 05:03.552
So do me a favor.
Let's keep it that way.

05:05.855 --> 05:07.424
Get out of here.

05:29.879 --> 05:33.747
Hi. I think there's
someone in my house.

05:33.749 --> 05:36.686
Shit.

06:47.322 --> 06:51.260
[Police radio chatter]

06:53.295 --> 06:54.695
No signs of forced entry.

06:54.697 --> 06:56.796
You certain the turners
didn't stop on by?

06:56.798 --> 06:58.832
Yeah, I'm sure.
Molly would have called me

06:58.834 --> 07:00.500
or left me a voicemail
or something.

07:00.502 --> 07:03.836
I searched the entire area.
The house is clean.

07:03.838 --> 07:07.341
I'm telling you guys,
there was someone in there.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.909
We'll have the prints
run for testing,

07:08.911 --> 07:11.445
see if there's anything
in our database that matches.

07:11.447 --> 07:13.615
We'll keep you posted.
That's all for now.

07:15.516 --> 07:17.351
Thank you.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.517
Let's get out of here.

07:18.519 --> 07:21.257
Come on, let's go.

07:31.634 --> 07:34.000
You know, Beth,

07:34.002 --> 07:37.639
when I finally...

07:40.942 --> 07:45.814
...found the guy
that took away our Abby...

07:49.517 --> 07:53.019
I was sure things
would go back to normal.

07:53.021 --> 07:55.555
Like, even though
she was dead,

07:55.557 --> 08:00.327
I figured you'd
find closure,

08:00.329 --> 08:01.527
that I would.

08:01.529 --> 08:04.967
But I don't know...

08:08.737 --> 08:11.904
I don't know
what to say to that.

08:11.906 --> 08:13.673
You found him,
but you're never going

08:13.675 --> 08:16.776
to be able to bring me back
my little girl alive.

08:16.778 --> 08:19.579
There are no more birthdays,

08:19.581 --> 08:22.819
graduation, no wedding
to look forward to.

08:23.918 --> 08:25.520
All that was taken.

08:35.596 --> 08:37.366
Is that why you left?

08:42.071 --> 08:45.372
Part of it was anger,

08:45.374 --> 08:48.711
and your obsession
with the case at the time.

08:50.611 --> 08:53.079
That's when I needed
you the most.

08:53.081 --> 08:57.450
You were so cold.

08:57.452 --> 08:59.956
Mostly because
she was her daddy's girl.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.962
She had your face

09:08.964 --> 09:11.401
and your heart.

09:13.969 --> 09:16.469
I just couldn't...

09:16.471 --> 09:18.740
I couldn't keep waking up
to that anymore.

09:22.644 --> 09:23.779
Hey.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.051
It's all right.
It's okay.

09:35.823 --> 09:37.059
I miss her.

09:39.861 --> 09:41.828

[Static continues]

11:14.923 --> 11:16.756
Hey.

11:16.758 --> 11:18.224
You don't look so good.

11:18.226 --> 11:20.759
- Barely sleeping.
- Why?

11:20.761 --> 11:23.597
I think there was someone
in the house again last night.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.598
- I don't...
- Should have called me.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.099
I mean, the police.
Did you call the police?

11:27.101 --> 11:28.701
Nothing in the house
was working,

11:28.703 --> 11:29.802
not the phones, nothing.

11:29.804 --> 11:31.771
I ended up back
at Anna's again.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.940
- Oh, wow.
- I know.

11:33.942 --> 11:35.742
The Turners have any
guns in the house?

11:35.744 --> 11:37.009
What am I gonna
do with a gun?

11:37.011 --> 11:38.612
I don't know.
I'm just saying.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.113
I wouldn't even know
how to use it.

11:40.115 --> 11:42.616
I'll keep the phone
and the bat close by.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.184
Cool.

11:44.186 --> 11:46.786
Hey, you got fitted
for your cap and gown yet?

11:46.788 --> 11:48.787
No, I haven't.
Want to go after class?

11:48.789 --> 11:50.956
- Yeah.
- All right. See you later?

11:50.958 --> 11:53.195
- Yeah. See you later.
- Yeah, okay. Bye.

11:56.965 --> 11:58.797
Just need to know
how it happened,

11:58.799 --> 12:00.068
what you can recall.

12:04.139 --> 12:06.640
This car appears
out of nowhere.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.608
I mean, things like this
just don't happen.

12:08.610 --> 12:11.143
What do you mean by that?

12:11.145 --> 12:13.813
I go to a gas station
to fill up

12:13.815 --> 12:16.282
and right in front of me
is a cutlass, okay?

12:16.284 --> 12:20.653
So the suspect hops back into
his vehicle at this point.

12:20.655 --> 12:21.820
Mm-hmm.

12:21.822 --> 12:24.690
And I followed him.

12:24.692 --> 12:26.194
So why didn't you
just take him then?

12:28.330 --> 12:30.030
And risk losing the girl?

12:30.032 --> 12:32.165
Do you think
there was a chance

12:32.167 --> 12:34.099
he would disclose her
whereabouts?

12:34.101 --> 12:36.002
I mean...

12:36.004 --> 12:38.003
All right.

12:38.005 --> 12:39.104
So you trailed him.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.743
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

12:46.648 --> 12:48.884
At what point
did you call for backup?

12:52.321 --> 12:54.257
As soon as I was sure
it was him.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.242
On the ground now!

13:49.244 --> 13:51.911
Get on the ground!

13:51.913 --> 13:54.381
- It's cool, man. I didn't do anything.
- Get on your knees.

13:54.383 --> 13:55.915
On the ground, now!

13:55.917 --> 13:58.251
- Just calm down.
- On the ground.

13:58.253 --> 13:59.819
It's all cool, all right?

13:59.821 --> 14:02.024
Hands behind your head.

14:12.134 --> 14:14.202
Take it easy, man.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.278
Hey, man!

14:26.280 --> 14:28.717
I'm not resisting.
Just chill the fuck out!

14:33.788 --> 14:35.954
- Where is she?
- Where is who?

14:35.956 --> 14:38.123
- Where's the girl?
- I don't know anything about...

14:38.125 --> 14:39.758
Tell me where
the girl is right now.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.893
I said I don't know anything
about any girl!

14:40.895 --> 14:42.728
Tell me where she is!

14:42.730 --> 14:46.936
- Where is she?
- She's over there.

15:09.990 --> 15:14.326
At what point
did he draw his gun?

15:14.328 --> 15:16.329
He spotted me
as soon as I moved in,

15:16.331 --> 15:18.334
and then he fired off
immediately.

15:27.241 --> 15:29.175
[Gunshot]

15:29.177 --> 15:30.743
Right.

15:30.745 --> 15:32.478
And you called the ambulance
shortly after,

15:32.480 --> 15:34.283
is that correct?

16:00.375 --> 16:02.278
[Gunshots]

16:10.051 --> 16:11.754

Sounds about right.

[Faint giggling]

17:46.615 --> 17:49.315
- Here you go.
- Thank you, but you know what?

17:49.317 --> 17:51.086
I'm not drinking
these days.

17:52.621 --> 17:56.525
This is a good picture.

17:58.326 --> 18:00.492
That's the last one
she ever took.

18:00.494 --> 18:04.330
This law student renting out
a room at the Turners'

18:04.332 --> 18:09.102
stumbled upon something I think
you might find interesting.

18:09.104 --> 18:10.636
It's too soon
to say exactly,

18:10.638 --> 18:12.071
but the bones she found

18:12.073 --> 18:15.642
appear to belong
to a small child.

18:15.644 --> 18:17.643
Yeah, they're being
tested now.

18:17.645 --> 18:20.646
Could be tied into one of
your earlier cases, pal.

18:20.648 --> 18:24.249
Hey.

18:24.251 --> 18:26.588
I'll understand if you're
not ready to come back.

to your case.

I'm Rachel.

19:48.536 --> 19:51.206
Please, come in.

19:58.445 --> 20:00.113
Sorry for the intrusion.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.614
No, not at all.
Thanks for coming out.

20:02.616 --> 20:04.750
I've been a little uneasy
the past few nights.

20:04.752 --> 20:06.651
Hopefully we can put
an end to that soon.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.086
Where are my manners?

20:08.088 --> 20:09.555
Would you like
something to drink?

20:09.557 --> 20:13.492
- Lemonade? Water?
- No thanks. I'm okay.

20:13.494 --> 20:16.629
Can you show me where
you found the remains?

20:16.631 --> 20:18.600
Yeah. Right this way.

20:24.772 --> 20:27.076
It's just over there.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.447
How much longer
do you think this will take?

20:34.449 --> 20:36.082
Because I have to get
to class.

20:36.084 --> 20:39.317
Here, just give me a call
at your convenience.

20:39.319 --> 20:40.686
- Okay.
- You don't mind

20:40.688 --> 20:42.587
if I stick around here
for awhile, do you?

20:42.589 --> 20:44.323
No, not at all.

20:44.325 --> 20:45.658
Stay as long
as you need to.

20:45.660 --> 20:46.996
Okay.

- Rachel.
- Hi. Rachel.

- Nice to meet you.
- He was just leaving.

Bye. How'd you do?

22:05.874 --> 22:07.675
You don't want to know.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.881
Damn. Damn.

22:14.883 --> 22:16.582
You studied
all week for this.

22:16.584 --> 22:18.884
- I know.
- You suck.

22:18.886 --> 22:22.755
Thank you.

22:22.757 --> 22:24.190
I think it drops me

22:24.192 --> 22:25.857
a full letter grade
in that class.

22:25.859 --> 22:27.392
That's all right.

22:27.394 --> 22:29.228
You still got
that mock case to work on.

22:29.230 --> 22:30.363
You can bring it up then.

22:30.365 --> 22:32.534
- I hope so.
- Easy.

22:35.435 --> 22:36.838
Got any plans tonight?

You want to work
on that case?

Do I have a choice now?

22:44.913 --> 22:47.613
I guess not.

22:47.615 --> 22:50.283
Let's see. Do you want to stop
by my place around seven?

22:50.285 --> 22:51.854
I should be home by then.

22:53.788 --> 22:56.288
Yeah, yeah.
Seven is great, yeah.

22:56.290 --> 22:59.292
Okay. Well, I got to head back
to class right now, so...

22:59.294 --> 23:01.826
- Have fun.
- Thank you. I will.

23:01.828 --> 23:03.731
You be good.

23:05.465 --> 23:07.632
- Seven o'clock.
- Seven.

23:07.634 --> 23:08.804
It's a date.

23:12.406 --> 23:15.274
Deborah, a slave working
at the Ferguson Sugar Factory,

23:15.276 --> 23:16.709
clubbed a man
as he approached her

23:16.711 --> 23:17.977
in her cabin.

23:17.979 --> 23:21.479
The man turned out
to be her master...

23:21.481 --> 23:23.548
Deborah was tried for murder
shortly thereafter,

23:23.550 --> 23:25.351
she would stand trial
and be sentenced

23:25.353 --> 23:27.319
to death by noose.

23:27.321 --> 23:28.353
Ouch.

23:28.355 --> 23:29.622
Man.

23:29.624 --> 23:31.492
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.668
All right, so...

23:42.670 --> 23:44.503
are we approaching this
with the intent

23:44.505 --> 23:46.372
to get our would-be
client set free

23:46.374 --> 23:48.908
or are we going to try
and get him a lesser charge?

23:48.910 --> 23:50.676
I just don't think
it's realistic

23:50.678 --> 23:53.482
for her to be set free
when we're talking murder here.

23:55.450 --> 23:57.549
Why don't we just
approach it in a way

23:57.551 --> 24:00.952
trying to avoid her from
getting hung for the crimes?

24:00.954 --> 24:02.854
Okay, yeah,
we can do that.

24:02.856 --> 24:05.790
- [Crashing]
- Oh, shit.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.695
Oh, no.

24:12.567 --> 24:14.366
Molly really
loved this vase too.

24:14.368 --> 24:16.901
Oh, man, it's all right.
We'll get her another one.

24:16.903 --> 24:19.942
No, you don't understand.
Her mom made this for her.

24:22.676 --> 24:24.809
How did it fall?

24:24.811 --> 24:27.380
It was probably just too close
to the edge of the table,

24:27.382 --> 24:28.483
I'm guessing.

24:30.951 --> 24:33.552
Do you have a broom?

24:33.554 --> 24:35.757
- Yeah, let me grab it.
- Okay.

24:56.711 --> 24:59.844
[Phone ringing]

24:59.846 --> 25:01.583
Hello.

25:41.556 --> 25:44.757
Okay.

25:44.759 --> 25:47.093
All right, so after
killing her master

25:47.095 --> 25:49.694
Deborah dragged the body
into a raging fire

25:49.696 --> 25:51.831
that she and a few other
slaves had built.

25:51.833 --> 25:53.966
Then early the next morning
she gathered up

25:53.968 --> 25:56.469
the remaining bone fragments
and spread them

25:56.471 --> 25:58.973
- throughout the fields.
- Hmm.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.808
Hey. Huh?

26:03.810 --> 26:05.745
- Wake up.
- I'm awake.

26:05.747 --> 26:07.849
- No, you're not.
- Violent.

26:10.751 --> 26:14.853
Huh. The ashes would then be
placed into ground up coffee

26:14.855 --> 26:16.721
and then served to the rest
of the slaves

26:16.723 --> 26:18.591
believing that that would
give them power

26:18.593 --> 26:21.160
- over their masters.
- What?

26:21.162 --> 26:24.796
Yeah, to the ground up coffee.

26:24.798 --> 26:27.565
Just kidding, I made up
the last part.

26:27.567 --> 26:28.700
- Humph.
- Hmm.

26:28.702 --> 26:29.969
You're so funny.

26:29.971 --> 26:31.136
I'm gonna call it a night.

26:31.138 --> 26:32.705
- I'm tired.
- Really?

26:32.707 --> 26:34.440
Yeah.

26:34.442 --> 26:36.074
Okay, well, fine,

26:36.076 --> 26:38.043
I'll just start building
our case, then.

26:38.045 --> 26:39.711
Okay, cool, then.
I'll just...

26:39.713 --> 26:41.680
I'll just see you
at school tomorrow, okay?

26:41.682 --> 26:43.082
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:43.084 --> 26:45.049
Oh, actually do you think
you could stop by

26:45.051 --> 26:46.619
and pick me up
in the morning?

26:46.621 --> 26:48.554
I haven't had a chance
to fix my bike yet.

26:48.556 --> 26:50.655
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

26:50.657 --> 26:53.191
Yeah, no problem.

26:53.193 --> 26:55.594
Okay, I'll see you
in the morning.

26:55.596 --> 26:57.028
All right.
See you in the morning.

26:57.030 --> 26:59.565
- Drive safely.
- Okay, bye.

26:59.567 --> 27:00.902
Bye.

27:36.471 --> 27:38.406
[Doorbell rings]

27:50.017 --> 27:51.920

27:55.056 --> 27:57.222
Rachel?

27:57.224 --> 27:59.794
We gotta go!
I don't wanna be late.

Hey! Is somebody
out there?

[Patrick] Do you need anything else?
Do you have my number?

31:21.194 --> 31:22.760
- [Woman] I got it right here.
- [Patrick] And my address?

31:22.762 --> 31:24.363
- [Woman] We're good.
- [Patrick] Yeah?

31:24.365 --> 31:26.131
- I'll be in tomorrow.
- Anytime you wanna call just...

31:26.133 --> 31:27.999
- All right, we'll find her.
- Okay, thank you, Officer.

31:28.001 --> 31:29.434
- You're welcome.
- Thank you very much.

31:29.436 --> 31:31.069
- Afternoon.
- Hi.

31:31.071 --> 31:33.706
- Deputy Forster.
- Detective Silva.

31:33.708 --> 31:36.475
Yeah, no sign of the girl,
or anyone for that matter.

31:36.477 --> 31:37.843
Did you talk to any
of these neighbors?

31:37.845 --> 31:40.045
Yeah, no one heard
or saw anything.

31:40.047 --> 31:43.047
It's Patrick.

31:43.049 --> 31:46.751
No, it's Rachel,
she's gone missing.

31:46.753 --> 31:47.986
Was anybody else here when
she disappeared?

31:47.988 --> 31:49.854
No. Patrick came by
this morning

31:49.856 --> 31:52.891
to give her a ride to school,
but she was already gone.

31:52.893 --> 31:55.059
Rachel's cell phone's
still here,

31:55.061 --> 31:56.728
books, keys.

31:56.730 --> 31:59.264
I don't know.
I... I came over...

31:59.266 --> 32:01.333
No, I came over earlier
and the door was open,

32:01.335 --> 32:02.468
but she's not here,

32:02.470 --> 32:04.169
and the cops
are here right now.

32:04.171 --> 32:06.071
I'd like to have a few words
with this guy.

32:06.073 --> 32:08.940
- Well, be my guest. I'm finished here.
- Thank you.

32:08.942 --> 32:10.742
Yeah, and the cops
are here right now.

32:10.744 --> 32:12.076
I... I gotta go.
All right?

32:12.078 --> 32:13.845
I'll talk...
I'll call you later. Bye.

- Hey.
- Hey.

How's it going?

32:16.416 --> 32:18.851
It's a nice area, man.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.753
Yeah.

32:20.755 --> 32:22.353
You're gonna
find her, right?

32:22.355 --> 32:26.357
That's what I intend
to do, yeah.

32:26.359 --> 32:29.795
You all right, here, I...

32:29.797 --> 32:31.764
- Nervous?
- Yeah, I am.

Sorry, I don't got a light.
I just... I'm trying to quit.

32:34.401 --> 32:36.270
I got one.

32:40.039 --> 32:44.977
Patrick, how long
have you known Rachel?

32:44.979 --> 32:48.180
I don't know.
A couple of months.

32:48.182 --> 32:50.882
You guys are just
classmates?

32:50.884 --> 32:53.454
Yeah, yeah, we're just...
just good friends.

32:56.390 --> 32:59.060
Would you like to be more
than just classmates?

33:01.428 --> 33:03.428
- Yeah.
- Hey, I don't blame you.

33:03.430 --> 33:05.296
She's a very
attractive girl.

33:05.298 --> 33:08.199
I'm sure she would have guys
lining up around this block

33:08.201 --> 33:10.401
to take her on a date.

33:10.403 --> 33:11.937
So what?

33:11.939 --> 33:13.538
What does that got
to do with anything?

33:13.540 --> 33:15.407
Well, it could be nothing.

33:15.409 --> 33:17.809
Patrick, you know how
little kids get

33:17.811 --> 33:20.879
when they want something
really bad

33:20.881 --> 33:24.283
and they don't get it?

33:24.285 --> 33:28.821
They, um,
they feel rejected.

33:28.823 --> 33:33.257
They start to act out.

33:33.259 --> 33:35.126
Throw a tantrum.

33:35.128 --> 33:37.129
Get violent.

33:37.131 --> 33:40.431
See what I'm getting at?

33:40.433 --> 33:41.970
Yeah.

33:43.903 --> 33:45.370
Something about that guy.

33:45.372 --> 33:47.573
That's not setting right
in my stomach though.

33:47.575 --> 33:49.173
Get a car on him?

33:49.175 --> 33:51.442
I got somebody out
on him, tailing him.

33:51.444 --> 33:53.312
Every move he makes.

33:53.314 --> 33:55.279
- All right, you take care.
- Yeah, thanks.

33:55.281 --> 33:57.216
- Don't tell him nothin'.
- I won't.

party out for Rachel.

on Weistheimer tonight.

be owning this town

on top of my station.

34:24.110 --> 34:25.943
Well, it's not for sale,
otherwise...

34:25.945 --> 34:28.914
Ooh, now back up.

34:28.916 --> 34:33.318
Well, what me and my son,
Junior, come down here for?

34:33.320 --> 34:35.152
I heard there's
a search party out

34:35.155 --> 34:36.954
looking for a girl
who's gone missing.

34:36.956 --> 34:38.623
Now, is there
any truth to that?

34:38.626 --> 34:40.324
There's some truth to it.

34:40.327 --> 34:42.661
I got a small army
that works for me.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.594
Now between the builders,
contractors,

34:44.597 --> 34:46.197
and even real estate agents,

34:46.199 --> 34:48.099
I got about a hundred people
that can help.

34:48.101 --> 34:49.635
Well, if you can spare them.

34:49.637 --> 34:51.168
Well, I'll send them
in shifts.

34:51.170 --> 34:52.938
How'd that be?

34:52.940 --> 34:54.972
Appreciate it.
We start one tonight.

34:54.974 --> 34:57.476
All right, well,
then it's settled.

34:57.478 --> 35:00.612
I'll get Junior
on the horn.

35:00.614 --> 35:02.951
- Ya'll have a good day.
- Thank you so much.

[Rumbling]

36:18.759 --> 36:23.260
I've known Patrick
since grade school.

36:23.262 --> 36:25.197
He was several years
ahead of me,

36:25.199 --> 36:28.633
but we just clicked.

36:28.635 --> 36:30.469
You know?

36:30.471 --> 36:32.436
Oh, we both met Rachel
around the same time

36:32.438 --> 36:33.704
when she started
school here.

36:33.706 --> 36:36.374
Just friends?

36:36.376 --> 36:37.675
Me and Patrick?

36:37.677 --> 36:39.378
Yeah.

36:39.380 --> 36:42.613
Just friends?

36:42.615 --> 36:46.351
We've fooled around
here and there.

36:46.353 --> 36:49.356
But, yeah,
friends mostly.

36:52.760 --> 36:57.561
Patrick's always been
into Rachel.

36:57.563 --> 36:58.764
How?

36:58.766 --> 37:01.465
Totally obsessed with her.

37:01.467 --> 37:05.037
How do you mean?

37:05.039 --> 37:08.340
He can't stop
talking about her.

37:08.342 --> 37:12.447
He's tried, but Rachel's never
shown any interest in him.

37:14.081 --> 37:18.383
You know, has he ever
shown aggression

37:18.385 --> 37:19.717
towards her?

37:19.719 --> 37:21.720
[Chuckles]
No.

37:21.722 --> 37:24.789
No.

37:24.791 --> 37:27.592
At least, not around me.

37:27.594 --> 37:30.362
How about you?

37:30.364 --> 37:34.132
- About me what?
- Been aggressive with you, or...

37:34.134 --> 37:35.400
- No.
- Did they get physical?

37:35.402 --> 37:37.202
- God, no.
- No?

37:37.204 --> 37:38.336
- What?
- You sure?

37:38.338 --> 37:39.537
- Yes.
- You sure about that?

37:39.539 --> 37:41.139
Yes.

37:41.141 --> 37:43.374
Why do you want to know
so much about Patrick?

37:43.376 --> 37:46.110
We have an open case that he
may or may not be involved in.

37:46.112 --> 37:48.746
You understand?

37:48.748 --> 37:50.217
- Yeah.
- Okay.

in there?

someone in here.

38:33.327 --> 38:34.796
Just hang on.

38:43.836 --> 38:45.836

- No, no, please don't leave me.

Please don't
leave me in here.

leave you in there.

39:17.538 --> 39:18.802
Hey, uh, pardon me,

39:18.804 --> 39:20.804
but, uh, you're
that superstar cop

39:20.806 --> 39:22.574
from the papers, right?

39:22.576 --> 39:23.909
Detective Silva.

39:23.911 --> 39:25.844
That's me.

39:25.846 --> 39:29.347
Listen, I just wanna thank you
for the job you're doin'.

39:29.349 --> 39:33.918
We all appreciate it
around here.

39:33.920 --> 39:37.389
Hey, Suzy, anything
Detective Silva has...

39:37.391 --> 39:38.789
- No...
- No.

39:38.791 --> 39:41.193
- All right.
- It's on my tab.

39:41.195 --> 39:45.197
All right? Give him one
of them Creamsicle sodas.

39:45.199 --> 39:47.532
Keep up the good work.

39:47.534 --> 39:49.269
Thank you.

39:51.204 --> 39:53.306
Thanks.

40:04.650 --> 40:07.385
Hey, you got a second?

40:07.387 --> 40:09.688
About as long as
it takes me to finish this.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.523
Great.

40:11.525 --> 40:12.856
How did you find me here?

40:12.858 --> 40:15.360
Uh, Lubbock informed me
you have breakfast

40:15.362 --> 40:17.362
here at least
four times a week.

40:17.364 --> 40:21.633
Mmm, well, hmm.

40:21.635 --> 40:25.537
Well, we're not friends and the only
time we speak is about the case,

40:25.539 --> 40:28.539
so I'm assuming that's why
you're here?

40:28.541 --> 40:30.575
Right.

40:30.577 --> 40:31.842
It's about the case.

40:31.844 --> 40:33.644
Welcome to Another Time
Soda Fountain.

40:33.646 --> 40:35.313
Would you like a menu?

40:35.315 --> 40:36.851
Oh, I'm fine.

40:40.253 --> 40:41.885
Phones still work.

40:41.887 --> 40:44.956
Well, I figured you'd want
the new passed on in person.

40:44.958 --> 40:46.758
You could email.

40:46.760 --> 40:49.594
- Well, I'll give you the short version.
- Please.

40:49.596 --> 40:51.630
You cleared.

40:51.632 --> 40:54.499
I submitted my report, you acted
in the victim's best interest.

40:54.501 --> 40:57.034
Moving in on the suspect
when he began firing on you,

40:57.036 --> 41:00.671
believing that the little
girl was still alive.

41:00.673 --> 41:03.874
Now, you told me
that for three days

41:03.876 --> 41:05.577
you're cleared of
of any negligence.

41:05.579 --> 41:07.545
However you will be under
careful observation

41:07.547 --> 41:08.947
for the next six months.

41:08.949 --> 41:10.949
It's not even a slap
on the hand, really,

41:10.951 --> 41:14.853
we had to deal out
something.

41:14.855 --> 41:17.521
- Do I owe you anything?
- Nope.

41:17.523 --> 41:19.023
Not for now anyway.

41:19.025 --> 41:20.691
Look, Lubbock's
vouching for you

41:20.693 --> 41:22.626
and that's all we need.

41:22.628 --> 41:24.896
You did a bad thing
for a good reason.

41:24.898 --> 41:27.365
Or at least, you did something
that needed to be done

41:27.367 --> 41:30.635
that goes against
what we deem acceptable.

41:30.637 --> 41:34.039
A man will hang one day
for his sins anyway.

41:34.041 --> 41:37.441
Food any good here?

41:37.443 --> 41:38.677
You can have
the rest of it.

41:38.679 --> 41:41.378
Egg whites?

41:41.380 --> 41:44.516
- You're not from around here, are you?
- No, sir.

41:44.518 --> 41:45.653
Enjoy.

42:15.548 --> 42:17.349
You're not being
charged with anything,

42:17.351 --> 42:18.983
so talk to us, pal.

42:18.985 --> 42:20.584
Then why are you here?

42:20.586 --> 42:22.554
I mean, you guys found
Rachel alive, right?

42:22.556 --> 42:26.293
You were the last person
to see her before she vanished.

42:28.027 --> 42:30.595
Yeah.

42:30.597 --> 42:32.429
We wanna catch
the people that did this.

42:32.431 --> 42:33.764
Maybe you missed something.

42:33.766 --> 42:35.833
Maybe you saw something,
but you don't remember.

42:35.835 --> 42:39.570
Think about it, pal.
Think about it.

42:39.572 --> 42:41.139
Can you not do that, please?

42:41.141 --> 42:42.574
- What?
- That.

42:42.576 --> 42:43.943
- What?
- [Patrick] That.

42:45.112 --> 42:48.579
That's a pretty rare box.

42:48.581 --> 42:51.883
Can I have it back, please?

42:51.885 --> 42:53.584
Thank you.

42:53.586 --> 42:57.588
Look, guys, like I told
you before, all right,

42:57.590 --> 42:59.824
I was at her house
studying that night,

42:59.826 --> 43:03.128
then I went home for the night,
I came back the next day,

43:03.130 --> 43:04.999
she was already gone.

43:07.099 --> 43:10.068
Rachel's doctor isn't letting
us talk to her right now,

43:10.070 --> 43:12.604
but as soon as we can,
I'm telling you, pal,

43:12.606 --> 43:14.572
we're gonna crack
this thing.

43:14.574 --> 43:18.041
Good, good,
I really hope you do.

43:18.043 --> 43:20.512
And then you better get
your story together,

43:20.514 --> 43:22.817
'cause you're gonna
need it real soon.

43:27.554 --> 43:28.887
He ain't breaking.

43:28.889 --> 43:30.688
He's either one hell
of an actor,

43:30.690 --> 43:33.724
- or he is telling the truth.
- When can I speak to Rachel?

43:33.726 --> 43:36.427
Her doc says first thing tomorrow
morning she'll be cleared.

43:36.429 --> 43:38.762
I'm going to speak with the
caretaker that found her.

43:38.764 --> 43:39.833
Good thinking, pal.

43:48.909 --> 43:52.010
I usually come down here
every Thursday,

43:52.012 --> 43:54.878
do maintenance
on the sugar factory,

43:54.880 --> 43:59.083
keep transients out
from breaking in.

43:59.085 --> 44:03.021
Keep the place tip top,
as much as I can.

44:03.023 --> 44:04.155
Anyway.

44:04.157 --> 44:08.059
- Ferguson's own it?
- Yeah.

44:08.061 --> 44:10.461
Joe and Junior.

44:10.463 --> 44:12.664
Matter of fact,

44:12.666 --> 44:15.769
they own all the surrounding
land around it.

44:21.041 --> 44:25.075
Don't look
like much now.

44:25.077 --> 44:28.782
This place was full
of life at one time.

44:30.550 --> 44:32.883
Although some say
it still is.

44:32.885 --> 44:35.787
If you get my meaning.

44:35.789 --> 44:38.856
I get paid to believe
in what I see.

44:38.858 --> 44:42.159
Facts, George, facts.

44:42.161 --> 44:44.662
Don't matter much.

44:44.664 --> 44:49.266
What's in here, don't
care which way you think,

44:49.268 --> 44:52.637
but it's always around.

44:52.639 --> 44:57.508
[Chuckles] What are they
gonna do with this place?

44:57.510 --> 45:00.244
I haven't
the darndest idea,

45:00.246 --> 45:04.548
although there's some talk
about Junior

45:04.550 --> 45:07.519
reopening the place
back up.

45:07.521 --> 45:10.822
Picking up where
his granddad left off.

45:10.824 --> 45:12.956
I'm all right, Molly.

45:12.958 --> 45:15.260
No, I really am.
Thank you for asking.

45:15.262 --> 45:18.530
You don't have
to worry about me, okay?

45:18.532 --> 45:22.133
[Sighs] Besides, graduation's
practically in a few days,

45:22.135 --> 45:24.672
I have a lot to concentrate
on before then.

45:26.273 --> 45:27.675
[Doorbell rings]

45:29.608 --> 45:31.208
Besides... Uh-huh,

45:31.210 --> 45:35.079
but you need to be
there for your mother.

45:35.081 --> 45:37.916
- [Knocking]
- Oh, I know you do, Molly.

45:37.918 --> 45:41.151
I know you do,
and I appreciate it.

45:41.153 --> 45:44.155
I know, but you really don't
have to worry about me anymore.

45:44.157 --> 45:46.291
Everything's fine now.

45:46.293 --> 45:48.726
Mm-hmm.

45:48.728 --> 45:50.295
Yes, I will.

45:50.297 --> 45:52.764
Actually, Molly, you know
what, look, can I call you

45:52.766 --> 45:55.166
back a little bit later,
the police just got here?

45:55.168 --> 45:58.769
Okay, tell Bill I say hi and I
hope your mom feels better.

45:58.771 --> 46:00.106
Okay?

46:06.079 --> 46:08.912
Thanks for stopping by.

46:08.914 --> 46:10.213
Would you like some water?

46:10.215 --> 46:11.652
Sure.

46:13.954 --> 46:18.255
So, how are you holding up?

46:18.257 --> 46:19.626
I'm not.

46:25.898 --> 46:28.999
But, my friend, Anna's going to
check on me from time to time,

46:29.001 --> 46:31.702
or at least until
the Turners get back.

46:31.704 --> 46:35.775
[Sighs] But, after graduation
I'm moving back to New York.

46:38.978 --> 46:41.878
Rachel, I want you
to think real hard,

46:41.880 --> 46:45.916
and tell me everything
about that night.

46:45.918 --> 46:49.854
The night
of your disappearance.

46:49.856 --> 46:52.023
It's okay.

46:52.025 --> 46:53.961
Take your time.

47:48.414 --> 47:50.817
[Thumps]

48:17.876 --> 48:20.213
Hey, I'm gonna
call the cops.

48:22.949 --> 48:26.086
[Rustling]

48:49.041 --> 48:50.777
[Knocking]

48:56.315 --> 48:58.418
[Rachel screaming]

49:02.755 --> 49:06.057
In all your years
as a homicide detective,

49:06.059 --> 49:08.825
have you ever experienced
something like this?

49:08.827 --> 49:10.264
No.

49:12.297 --> 49:14.233
There has to be something.

49:17.269 --> 49:19.537
So you're saying what happened
to me the other night,

49:19.539 --> 49:21.271
there's no
explanation for it?

49:21.273 --> 49:24.978
And that maybe
there never will be.

49:28.882 --> 49:31.018
Did you go back to the place
where I was found?

49:35.288 --> 49:36.954
There's nothing there.

49:36.956 --> 49:38.255
Just an old derelict
building

49:38.257 --> 49:40.126
waiting to be torn
to the ground.

49:45.798 --> 49:48.101
We found this next to you.

49:49.835 --> 49:51.936
It belongs
to a Melissa Ward.

49:51.938 --> 49:54.304
She's a law student that went
missing a few years ago.

49:54.306 --> 49:56.743
She went to your school.

50:00.213 --> 50:02.079
A few days after
she went missing

50:02.081 --> 50:04.014
her bloodstained clothes

50:04.016 --> 50:07.952
was found in a dumpster
near her home.

50:07.954 --> 50:10.822
Her husband, Clayton Ward, is
still the main suspect at large.

50:10.824 --> 50:14.559
- Would you know them?
- No.

50:14.561 --> 50:18.195
They must have been
a few years ahead of me.

50:18.197 --> 50:21.100
We're hoping
he's back in town.

50:23.302 --> 50:24.969
[Sighs]

50:24.971 --> 50:29.574
Detective Silva, look,

50:29.576 --> 50:32.976
I really think this thing

50:32.978 --> 50:37.180
wants me to go back.

50:37.182 --> 50:39.916
I'm guessing there
has to be a reason

50:39.918 --> 50:42.288
for why I ended up
in that place.

50:45.557 --> 50:48.494
Well, whoever killed
Melissa Ward

50:51.264 --> 50:53.099
had the same plans
for you.

50:57.436 --> 50:59.936
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:59.938 --> 51:01.505
Hey, I missed you.

51:01.507 --> 51:04.175
I mean... I mean I missed you
in class today.

51:04.177 --> 51:05.476
Yeah.

51:05.478 --> 51:07.411
I wasn't feeling well.

51:07.413 --> 51:09.045
Yeah.

51:09.047 --> 51:11.215
Well, Professor Martinez,
he gave us an extension

51:11.217 --> 51:12.950
on that mock case
we were working on.

51:12.952 --> 51:15.019
Oh, really? Well, how much
longer do we have?

51:15.021 --> 51:17.655
[Chuckles]
Till graduation.

51:17.657 --> 51:20.958
- I mean, it's not that much longer.
- Yeah.

51:20.960 --> 51:22.293
That's good though.

51:22.295 --> 51:24.128
So, are you, what?
You ready to get back

51:24.130 --> 51:25.195
on this thing, or what?

51:25.197 --> 51:27.097
Yeah, I think so.

51:27.099 --> 51:29.666
Hey, do you remember that
abandoned factory I was found at?

51:29.668 --> 51:31.204
Yeah.

51:33.472 --> 51:35.472
I found these
drawings there.

51:35.474 --> 51:37.411
I think they're related
to our case somehow.

51:44.583 --> 51:46.619
Oh, wow.

52:05.271 --> 52:07.304
Any luck on your end?

52:07.306 --> 52:09.005
The case we were
assigned to,

52:09.007 --> 52:11.409
it's an old murder case
from the Slave Era, right?

52:11.411 --> 52:14.345
Ten points, Rach, we got
that part down already.

52:14.347 --> 52:17.648
[Sighs] The factory
she used to work at

52:17.650 --> 52:19.316
is the same one
I was found in.

52:19.318 --> 52:21.151
It's owned by Junior
and Joe Ferguson.

52:21.153 --> 52:24.021
It's been in their family
since 1838 when it first opened.

52:24.023 --> 52:26.523
Families around here go back
several generations.

52:26.525 --> 52:28.291
I mean, you can't blame
the Fergusons

52:28.293 --> 52:30.695
for atrocities committed
by their ancestors.

52:30.697 --> 52:33.697
How does it relate
to our case, anyway?

52:33.699 --> 52:36.200
I don't know.
Maybe it doesn't.

52:36.202 --> 52:37.969
I just think Clayton
and Melissa

52:37.971 --> 52:41.074
were discovering something
even beyond the case.

52:43.108 --> 52:45.376
Slave labor,
prison labor?

52:45.378 --> 52:48.311
See for yourself.
It's all here.

52:48.313 --> 52:52.615
A lot of people died under the
Ferguson name to build this town.

52:52.617 --> 52:54.517
There has to be
more to this, right?

52:54.519 --> 52:57.588
Think about it, why else was
I drawn to that factory?

52:57.590 --> 52:59.992
Something wanted me
to see it.

53:10.168 --> 53:13.137
Hi.

53:13.139 --> 53:16.106
Well, never thought
I'd see you anymore

53:16.108 --> 53:18.742
in this place again.

53:18.744 --> 53:20.744
That makes two of us.

53:20.746 --> 53:25.115
I, uh, I never got a chance
to thank you for finding me.

53:25.117 --> 53:28.686
Things could have been
a lot worse if you hadn't.

53:28.688 --> 53:32.523
Well, I just happened
to be passing by

53:32.525 --> 53:34.758
at the right time.

53:34.760 --> 53:38.128
I've always had
a knack for that.

53:38.130 --> 53:40.463
I would offer you
a chair if I had one.

53:40.465 --> 53:42.633
Oh, don't worry about it,
I don't want to take up

53:42.635 --> 53:44.334
too much of your time.

53:44.336 --> 53:46.637
I, um, I just wanted
to stop by, also,

53:46.639 --> 53:48.472
to ask you something.

53:48.474 --> 53:51.441
Do you remember a law student
by the name of Clayton Ward?

53:51.443 --> 53:54.211
He and his wife, Melissa, had
done an interview with you here

53:54.213 --> 53:56.246
regarding this place
several years ago?

53:56.248 --> 54:00.784
It's all here in this
mock case we're working on.

54:00.786 --> 54:02.753
Hmm.

54:02.755 --> 54:05.655
I remember them.

54:05.657 --> 54:08.592
Clayton was a quiet man.

54:08.594 --> 54:11.729
Kept to his self a lot.

54:11.731 --> 54:14.664
Watched his words
very carefully.

54:14.666 --> 54:16.367
You're required
to disclose the fact

54:16.369 --> 54:18.269
that these new tract homes

54:18.271 --> 54:21.271
are being built
on a former slave plantation.

54:21.273 --> 54:23.673
And in certain cases,
burial grounds.

54:23.675 --> 54:25.376
I see none of that there.

54:25.378 --> 54:26.644
Is it there?

54:26.646 --> 54:28.579
No.

54:28.581 --> 54:32.148
- How much are you looking for exactly?
- What now?

54:32.150 --> 54:34.851
No one comes barging in here
not looking for something.

54:34.853 --> 54:36.720
Mm-hmm.

54:36.722 --> 54:38.722
We're not looking
for anything,

54:38.724 --> 54:40.291
we just wanna
run this by you

54:40.293 --> 54:41.791
before we take it
any further.

54:41.793 --> 54:44.195
A lot of this can
be resolved easily

54:44.197 --> 54:46.296
outside the courts
with no fuss.

54:46.298 --> 54:47.565
Hmm.

54:47.567 --> 54:49.365
You damn right about that.

54:49.367 --> 54:51.534
Yeah, I'll tell you what,

54:51.536 --> 54:54.104
when you're ready
to talk again,

54:54.106 --> 54:55.840
give me a call.

54:55.842 --> 54:57.575
[Rachel] Did they
ever find her body?

54:57.577 --> 55:02.345
Oh, no, but it's just
a matter of time, though.

55:02.347 --> 55:05.583
It's a shame
when youth is taken

55:05.585 --> 55:08.121
so quickly like that.

55:11.623 --> 55:14.557
She brought me here.

55:14.559 --> 55:18.229
What's you talking about?

55:18.231 --> 55:20.231
I think she was trying
to tell me something.

55:20.233 --> 55:23.666
She, uh, she's the one
who led me to this place.

55:23.668 --> 55:26.470
Hmm.

55:26.472 --> 55:29.206
How much you believe
in the afterlife?

55:29.208 --> 55:33.344
Spirits and things
like that?

55:33.346 --> 55:36.313
To be honest with you,
I never used to,

55:36.315 --> 55:39.916
but lately...

55:39.918 --> 55:42.887
lately that's
been changing.

55:42.889 --> 55:47.258
Well, you've been tapped
on the shoulder

55:47.260 --> 55:51.798
and it wasn't by accident,
it's for a reason.

55:54.867 --> 55:58.536
My father always told us

55:58.538 --> 56:02.409
the dead speak
and you can summons the dead

56:03.643 --> 56:05.512
without even realizing it.

56:09.648 --> 56:12.650
You just keep listening,

56:12.652 --> 56:16.322
you'll find out
what you looking for.

56:17.389 --> 56:19.358
What do you think she wants?

56:26.965 --> 56:30.269
For you to find out
who killed her.

56:32.938 --> 56:34.273
[Doorbell rings]

56:40.713 --> 56:43.150
- You got a minute?
- Of course. Come in.

56:49.588 --> 56:53.490
This is a very
interesting case, Rachel.

56:53.492 --> 56:55.992
- Any new developments?
- A lot of new developments.

56:55.994 --> 56:58.595
Actually, Forensics came back
and they found the results

56:58.597 --> 57:00.331
on the remains you found.

57:00.333 --> 57:04.767
Well, they claim it's
at least a hundred years old.

57:04.769 --> 57:07.338
You know, in these parts,
especially around Sugar Land,

57:07.340 --> 57:10.907
and it's not uncommon
for cemeteries to be shifted

57:10.909 --> 57:13.978
once a new development
comes in.

57:13.980 --> 57:18.414
Sometimes the dead
get left behind.

57:18.416 --> 57:20.450
- So that's it?
- That's it.

57:20.452 --> 57:23.820
They belong to a woman that
passed away in the 1800s.

57:23.822 --> 57:25.588
Died of natural causes.

57:25.590 --> 57:28.358
Truthfully, I was hoping
it was Melissa Ward belongings

57:28.360 --> 57:30.293
it's because I'm really
tired of this case.

57:30.295 --> 57:32.665
Well, then I found something
that could be useful to you.

57:38.670 --> 57:40.336
I found this.

57:40.338 --> 57:42.740
Okay, it was an old mock case
that Clayton Ward

57:42.742 --> 57:44.608
and his wife
were putting together.

57:44.610 --> 57:46.010
It talks about
Sugar Land's past.

57:46.012 --> 57:48.612
It hasn't been
exposed yet.

57:48.614 --> 57:51.581
It's interesting.

57:51.583 --> 57:54.885
We already got a copy.

57:54.887 --> 57:59.623
Okay, well, then, any idea on why
they would have disappeared?

57:59.625 --> 58:02.458
Nothing I can tell you.

58:02.460 --> 58:05.362
Still an open case and Clayton
Ward is still our main suspect.

58:05.364 --> 58:08.032
We have Melissa's
disappearance,

58:08.034 --> 58:10.300
the bloody clothes
right next to her house.

58:10.302 --> 58:12.672
Doesn't take a genius
to figure this one out.

58:15.440 --> 58:19.742
- Did you believe me?
- About what?

58:19.744 --> 58:22.313
The other day when I told you
about what happened to me

58:22.315 --> 58:24.380
the night I was taken,
did you even believe me?

58:24.382 --> 58:27.483
No.
Absolutely not.

58:27.485 --> 58:29.485
There's a logical explanation
for everything

58:29.487 --> 58:31.621
we just have
to look closer.

58:31.623 --> 58:35.958
What did you say,
the something spirit

58:35.960 --> 58:38.762
took you back
to the sugar factory?

58:38.764 --> 58:42.333
Well, that's ridiculous.

58:42.335 --> 58:44.934
Who then?

58:44.936 --> 58:47.773
I don't know. Still trying
to figure that out.

01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:45.992
[Thumps]

01:01:23.996 --> 01:01:28.635
[Faint whispering]
Rachel. Rachel.

01:02:57.755 --> 01:03:00.259
- Here you go.
- No, thank you.

01:03:03.862 --> 01:03:06.028
Well,

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:09.633
what can I help you out
there with, little lady?

01:03:09.635 --> 01:03:11.767
Does the name Clayton Ward
mean anything to you?

01:03:11.769 --> 01:03:15.771
Yeah, he's a wanted man,
if I'm not mistaken.

01:03:15.773 --> 01:03:18.041
You're also one of the last
people to speak with him

01:03:18.043 --> 01:03:20.242
before he vanished.

01:03:20.244 --> 01:03:22.945
I have some notes here
regarding a conversation.

01:03:22.947 --> 01:03:25.882
It looks like it was you,
Junior Ferguson,

01:03:25.884 --> 01:03:28.385
and Clayton Ward
about three years ago.

01:03:28.387 --> 01:03:30.086
- Do you remember that?
- Crystal.

01:03:30.088 --> 01:03:32.789
Like it was yesterday.
What about it?

01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:37.661
- What can you tell me?
- Not a whole lot.

01:03:37.663 --> 01:03:40.396
He and his wife were working
an old case regarding a slave

01:03:40.398 --> 01:03:42.932
who had murdered her master.

01:03:42.934 --> 01:03:46.072
Now, the man shared a name
and a bloodline with me.

01:03:47.706 --> 01:03:49.905
Daddy, we got a meeting
in about five minutes.

01:03:49.907 --> 01:03:52.876
This won't take that long.
You got three minutes.

01:03:52.878 --> 01:03:55.012
[Clear throat] Well, it
also says in this report

01:03:55.014 --> 01:03:56.979
that you've been
failing to disclose

01:03:56.981 --> 01:03:58.749
certain information
to the public,

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.916
especially regarding the land
you've been building

01:04:00.918 --> 01:04:02.753
your tract homes on.

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:05.155
Now, I'm still not catching
what you're getting at here.

01:04:05.157 --> 01:04:06.956
I own that land.

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:09.191
I'm not doing anything
illegal by it. Never have.

01:04:09.193 --> 01:04:11.961
You're building on land
that was worked on

01:04:11.963 --> 01:04:16.800
by prisoners and slaves.

01:04:16.802 --> 01:04:19.001
Look, I mean,
some of the land

01:04:19.003 --> 01:04:21.206
is also the burial sites
for some slaves.

01:04:23.141 --> 01:04:24.910
Hmm.

01:04:28.447 --> 01:04:32.782
Listen, we turn
a blind eye sometimes

01:04:32.784 --> 01:04:34.784
because it's necessary.

01:04:34.786 --> 01:04:37.820
Makes us feel
all warm and fuzzy.

01:04:37.822 --> 01:04:39.956
We go any further
than that,

01:04:39.958 --> 01:04:41.894
people start to get
a bad feeling.

01:04:44.697 --> 01:04:47.296
You're worried.

01:04:47.298 --> 01:04:50.133
You're worried that people
would stop buying from you

01:04:50.135 --> 01:04:53.003
if they knew the full
truth, is that it?

01:04:53.005 --> 01:04:54.641
Daddy, we gotta go.

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.976
You know, you're acting
like you're providing

01:05:00.978 --> 01:05:04.113
brand new information.

01:05:04.115 --> 01:05:07.918
Clayton Ward believed
the same thing.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:09.119
Then why not disclose it?

01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:10.454
Isn't what you're doing
illegal?

01:05:10.456 --> 01:05:13.356
[Chuckling]
You're the lawyer.

01:05:13.358 --> 01:05:15.891
You tell me.

01:05:15.893 --> 01:05:19.162
Now listen, we can
continue this conversation

01:05:19.164 --> 01:05:22.132
at a later date
if you'd like,

01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:26.336
but right now, I've got a
meeting with some grown-ups.

01:05:26.338 --> 01:05:28.173
Bye-bye.

01:05:32.177 --> 01:05:34.447
[Junior]
You should frame these.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.416
Ooh.

01:05:40.085 --> 01:05:42.918
- Cute kids.
- Yeah, they are.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.854
A little pain in the ass,
but they're good.

01:05:44.856 --> 01:05:46.789
I like them.

01:05:46.791 --> 01:05:49.793
Hey, before we go in, I haven't
had a chance to pick up.

01:05:49.795 --> 01:05:51.260
So it's gonna be
a little messy.

01:05:51.262 --> 01:05:52.829
Don't worry about it, okay?

01:05:52.831 --> 01:05:54.166
I warned you.

01:05:57.235 --> 01:05:58.704
Come on in.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.175
Okay, so, uh, I'm gonna
go get my laptop

01:06:06.177 --> 01:06:07.846
from the other room.

01:06:10.081 --> 01:06:12.184
- Make yourself at home here.
- Cool.

01:06:14.018 --> 01:06:16.787
Mi casa, su casa.

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:20.891
You want anything to drink?
Some water, some wine?

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:22.858
- No, I'm good.
- You sure?

01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:24.528
Mm-hmm.
Nice place.

01:06:24.530 --> 01:06:27.066
Okay, thanks, yeah.
I'll be right back.

01:06:59.164 --> 01:07:02.164
[Patrick] Hey! You hear
from the Fergusons?

01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:06.369
Yeah, yeah, I just...

01:07:06.371 --> 01:07:08.405
I was just over there.

01:07:08.407 --> 01:07:12.041
Couldn't get anything
out of them though.

01:07:12.043 --> 01:07:15.110
- You all right?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

01:07:15.112 --> 01:07:18.849
I'm just thinking I've been
feeling kinda sick lately.

01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:21.351
- Oh.
- Like everything I'm going through.

01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:22.885
I'm not feeling well.

01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:24.521
I can get you some
medication and stuff.

01:07:24.523 --> 01:07:26.021
An aspirin?
No, you know what,

01:07:26.023 --> 01:07:27.557
don't even worry
about it, I'm fine.

01:07:27.559 --> 01:07:28.992
I'm just gonna go,
but... Oh!

01:07:28.994 --> 01:07:30.961
Rachel.
It's all right, Rachel.

01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:32.298
It's okay, I got it.

01:07:36.134 --> 01:07:38.869
Probably excited.

01:07:38.871 --> 01:07:40.302
You don't look
so good.

01:07:40.304 --> 01:07:43.974
Oh, I'll be fine.
I'm fine, thank you.

01:07:43.976 --> 01:07:48.144
Sorry. I just...
I think I'm still shaken,

01:07:48.146 --> 01:07:50.079
that's all.

01:07:50.081 --> 01:07:51.514
I thought I was over it.
Shaken up.

01:07:51.516 --> 01:07:53.249
What about the assignment
and stuff?

01:07:53.251 --> 01:07:55.552
You know what? I'll call you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:07:55.554 --> 01:07:57.454
I'm just...

01:07:57.456 --> 01:07:59.425
I just thought
I was over it.

01:08:04.429 --> 01:08:07.630
Sorry, Rach... I... Sorry,
I... I have the keys.

01:08:07.632 --> 01:08:09.065
The keys...
It's a habit.

01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:11.166
I just... Sorry.

01:08:11.168 --> 01:08:13.103
It's a habit of locking
the door behind me.

01:08:13.105 --> 01:08:16.639
So, um, tomorrow. I'll just keep working.
Is that cool?

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.908
And then tomorrow,
we'll just meet up in class

01:08:18.911 --> 01:08:21.277
and then, I don't know,
compare notes or something.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:22.546
- Cool.
- Yeah?

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:25.214
Bye.

01:08:25.216 --> 01:08:28.285
[Rachel]
I just need to know.

01:08:28.287 --> 01:08:32.321
Was Patrick ever a suspect
in the Melissa Ward case?

01:08:32.323 --> 01:08:34.323
Nope.

01:08:34.326 --> 01:08:37.626
He's still a suspect
for your disappearance though.

01:08:37.627 --> 01:08:41.464
Just trying to pin a reason
to bring him in again.

01:08:41.466 --> 01:08:43.666
He knew
Clayton and Melissa.

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:46.669
Look, I know this probably doesn't
make any sense to you right now,

01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:50.205
but I'm telling you, it's like she was
trying to lead me to her and Clayton.

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:52.575
Yeah, the case we were working
on just so happened to be

01:08:52.577 --> 01:08:55.678
the exact same case that they were
working on before they disappeared.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.113
The fact that he knows them
is clearly circumstance.

01:08:58.115 --> 01:09:00.482
It doesn't automatically
make him a suspect.

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:03.455
They lead me to that factory,
and there was a reason for it.

01:09:27.145 --> 01:09:30.682
Patty, boy!
Are you in there?

01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:36.188
Hello?

01:09:37.721 --> 01:09:40.926
Come to see if that
plumbing issue got resolved.

01:09:51.036 --> 01:09:53.270
Hang back.
Don't get in the way.

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:00.677
Ah, man.

01:10:00.679 --> 01:10:04.113
I'll get on the radio
and start a search for him.

01:10:04.115 --> 01:10:06.648
Lubbock.

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:08.751
What the hell is this?

01:10:08.753 --> 01:10:10.419
You're fucked, Patty boy.

01:10:10.421 --> 01:10:12.524
Go home, Junior.

01:10:15.761 --> 01:10:17.727
You guys can't be in here
without a warrant.

01:10:17.729 --> 01:10:19.062
We have probable cause.

01:10:19.064 --> 01:10:20.362
Oh, you do?

01:10:20.364 --> 01:10:22.665
- Have a seat.
- I don't wanna sit.

01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.704
Make it easy
on yourself, pal.

01:10:32.778 --> 01:10:34.713
Right here would be good.

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:41.518
[Sighs]

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.553
So you two still think
I'm wanna hurt Rachel?

01:10:43.555 --> 01:10:45.455
We're not here
about Rachel.

01:10:45.457 --> 01:10:47.790
Clayton and Melissa Ward.

01:10:47.792 --> 01:10:50.593
When's the last time
you saw them?

01:10:50.595 --> 01:10:52.528
I don't know.

01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:54.397
What, maybe,
three years ago.

01:10:54.399 --> 01:10:55.464
Why?

01:10:55.466 --> 01:10:56.633
You guys were close, right?

01:10:56.635 --> 01:10:58.401
Friends, classmates.

01:10:58.403 --> 01:11:01.437
You don't seem too worked up
over their disappearance.

01:11:01.439 --> 01:11:02.839
It was a long time ago.

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:06.709
You know, Clayton is still
the final suspect.

01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:09.711
I think you know
where he is.

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:11.313
No.

01:11:11.315 --> 01:11:13.215
You're lying.

01:11:13.217 --> 01:11:15.151
Why would I lie
about something like that?

01:11:15.153 --> 01:11:18.821
I don't know, buddy,
you tell me.

01:11:18.823 --> 01:11:20.290
I told you
when we first met

01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:21.691
I'd find out the truth.

01:11:21.693 --> 01:11:25.195
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:27.763
I'm gonna go get
a burger.

01:11:27.765 --> 01:11:29.398
You guys want anything?

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.666
I'm a vegetarian.

01:11:30.668 --> 01:11:33.635
Healthy man,
good for you.

01:11:33.637 --> 01:11:35.671
[Whispers]
Your loss.

01:11:35.673 --> 01:11:37.510
[Lubbock]
Be smart.

01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:44.113
So, you know the old
sugar factory on Six?

01:11:44.115 --> 01:11:47.217
Yeah, it's where
Rachel was found.

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:49.885
Okay, so, do you
wanna tell me

01:11:49.887 --> 01:11:52.155
what you were doing there
the other day?

01:11:52.157 --> 01:11:54.624
What are you
talking about?

01:11:54.626 --> 01:11:58.894
You were there
the other day.

01:11:58.896 --> 01:12:02.365
Come on.

01:12:02.367 --> 01:12:05.401
Yeah, well, I wasn't there,
I was like...

01:12:05.403 --> 01:12:10.440
I go for walks behind the
building to clear my head.

01:12:10.442 --> 01:12:11.641
You clear your head?

01:12:11.643 --> 01:12:14.210
At an abandoned
sugar factory?

01:12:14.212 --> 01:12:18.414
No, I go for walks behind the
building there. So what?

01:12:18.416 --> 01:12:21.317
- You walk behind the building?
- Yeah, to clear my head.

01:12:21.319 --> 01:12:24.190
- Then, to clear your head.
- That's what I said.

01:12:27.158 --> 01:12:30.226
Is that where you
buried the body?

01:12:30.228 --> 01:12:32.762
- What?
- Yeah, is that how... is what it is?

01:12:32.764 --> 01:12:36.398
What about Clayton's wife? And you
buried her at the sugar factory.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.836
That's what happened.

01:12:40.171 --> 01:12:44.273
Listen, if you're gonna
accuse me of something,

01:12:44.275 --> 01:12:46.241
then bring me in.

01:12:46.243 --> 01:12:49.614
If not, this conversation,
it's over.

01:13:22.948 --> 01:13:26.281
Hi.

01:13:26.283 --> 01:13:28.250
Howdy.

01:13:28.252 --> 01:13:31.353
Hi, I'm Rachel. I don't think
we've officially met.

01:13:31.355 --> 01:13:33.690
Yeah, oh, pardon
my poor manners.

01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:35.424
My hands are dirty.

01:13:35.426 --> 01:13:37.960
That's okay.

01:13:37.962 --> 01:13:40.429
That's a nice watch.

01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:43.633
Oh, that's kind
of you to say.

01:13:43.635 --> 01:13:45.604
It's been in the family
for generations.

01:13:47.505 --> 01:13:50.540
You're showing a lot
of interest around here.

01:13:50.542 --> 01:13:52.775
What exactly are you
doing out here anyhow?

01:13:52.777 --> 01:13:56.979
Oh, an old murder case
about a slave from the 1800s.

01:13:56.981 --> 01:13:58.714
Well, partly, anyway.

01:13:58.716 --> 01:14:02.684
It's why I went
to visit your dad.

01:14:02.686 --> 01:14:05.687
What do you care
about some slave been dead

01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:08.023
for over a century
and a half for?

01:14:08.025 --> 01:14:10.526
Because nobody
even knows about it,

01:14:10.528 --> 01:14:12.594
and they don't even
know about the slave labor

01:14:12.596 --> 01:14:14.830
that's used
in the factories.

01:14:14.832 --> 01:14:18.835
I still can't quite get
what you're aiming at.

01:14:18.837 --> 01:14:20.669
It's just for school.

01:14:20.671 --> 01:14:23.705
Hey, you stay in that
Turner house, don't you?

01:14:23.707 --> 01:14:25.375
How do you know that?

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:28.644
It's my first deal,
actually.

01:14:28.646 --> 01:14:32.014
Daddy let me do
the entire deal by myself.

01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:34.519
Mm-hmm. It's a nice
place, isn't it?

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:37.786
Yep.

01:14:37.788 --> 01:14:41.624
You're the one that found
there were remains, right?

01:14:41.626 --> 01:14:44.527
Yeah, you missed something
when you built the house.

01:14:44.529 --> 01:14:47.030
Well, it happens.

01:14:47.032 --> 01:14:49.668
It's old.
What do you expect?

01:14:52.337 --> 01:14:53.936
I, actually, would like
to schedule another interview

01:14:53.938 --> 01:14:55.871
with you and your dad,

01:14:55.873 --> 01:14:58.875
if that's all right?

01:14:58.877 --> 01:15:00.713
I'll set something up.

01:15:12.923 --> 01:15:15.590
You should come in sometimes.

01:15:15.592 --> 01:15:18.960
Maybe next time.

01:15:18.962 --> 01:15:22.764
I'll save a seat for you.

01:15:22.766 --> 01:15:25.637
You'll find the answers
you're looking for.

01:15:28.472 --> 01:15:32.674
And what might those be?

01:15:32.676 --> 01:15:37.412
Look, son, the entire town
loves your Abby.

01:15:37.414 --> 01:15:40.883
We all still miss her.

01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:43.052
We're not asking you
to forget about her.

01:15:43.054 --> 01:15:45.455
That's impossible,

01:15:45.457 --> 01:15:49.595
but just come in,
it will help.

01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:56.499
I don't know.

01:15:56.501 --> 01:15:58.904
The place never
helped me before.

01:16:01.472 --> 01:16:04.040
It takes time.

01:16:04.042 --> 01:16:07.546
I know you didn't come all
this way to talk about church.

01:16:10.849 --> 01:16:11.984
Yeah.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:19.358
I got a warrant to search
the sugar factory.

01:16:22.627 --> 01:16:26.896
Can you help me get in?

01:16:26.898 --> 01:16:28.464
Sure thing.

01:16:28.466 --> 01:16:31.770
I got spare keys
you can use.

01:19:19.002 --> 01:19:20.303
- [Rachel] Hi.
- [Junior] Hi.

01:19:20.305 --> 01:19:22.071
Come on in and make
yourself at home.

01:19:22.073 --> 01:19:23.642
I just have
to turn off the oven.

01:19:32.884 --> 01:19:36.788
Wow. The place looks
just like I remembered it.

01:19:40.091 --> 01:19:41.991
Say, Bill and Molly around?

01:19:41.993 --> 01:19:43.326
No, they're still
out of town,

01:19:43.328 --> 01:19:45.995
they'll be back
tomorrow afternoon.

01:19:45.997 --> 01:19:48.100
I'll have to catch up
with old bill.

01:19:55.672 --> 01:20:00.009
You know, Daddy's
a little worried

01:20:00.011 --> 01:20:02.848
about all this talk.

01:20:07.819 --> 01:20:09.988
I thought we buried
all that.

01:22:09.306 --> 01:22:11.941
Why do you think he wanted us
to meet him here, anyways?

01:22:11.943 --> 01:22:15.443
I don't know.
It's pretty run down.

01:22:15.445 --> 01:22:17.112
Yeah, it looks deserted.

01:22:17.114 --> 01:22:20.148
Yeah, maybe he wants
to offer us a bribe.

01:22:20.150 --> 01:22:23.085
- I'm not gonna take it.
- What was that?

01:22:23.087 --> 01:22:24.152
What was what?

01:22:24.154 --> 01:22:26.955
- Did you hear that?
- No.

01:22:26.957 --> 01:22:28.424
I think you're too worried.

01:22:28.426 --> 01:22:30.092
[Melissa]
This place creeps me out.

01:22:30.094 --> 01:22:31.427
[Clayton]
No, it'll be fine.

01:22:31.429 --> 01:22:33.998
- In. Out.
- [Gun cocks]

01:22:36.067 --> 01:22:38.768
Get down
on your fuckin' knees.

01:22:38.770 --> 01:22:40.072
[Melissa]
Okay.

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:46.776
What were you planning
on doing, Clayton?

01:22:46.778 --> 01:22:47.977
Nothing.
We just wanna go.

01:22:47.979 --> 01:22:49.277
We can forget everything.

01:22:49.279 --> 01:22:51.147
Please, just let us go.

01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:55.020
They say there's
dead slaves... Property.

01:22:56.554 --> 01:22:59.155
How you gonna feel
when you meet them

01:22:59.157 --> 01:23:01.055
on the other side?

01:23:01.057 --> 01:23:02.958
- Huh?
- [Gun shot]

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:05.329
It's a beautiful place,
isn't it?

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.336
I aim to keep it
that way.

01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:19.441
- You killed them?
- Had to.

01:23:19.443 --> 01:23:23.379
Couldn't done ruin an empire
I'd eventually inherit.
