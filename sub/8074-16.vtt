WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.642
[theme music]

00:09.643 --> 00:11.612
[doorbell rings]

00:11.645 --> 00:13.847
I'll be there in a second.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.583
Why do people always
interrupt us whenever

00:15.616 --> 00:16.817
we start to fool around?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.686
Well, it's all
part of my plot.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.755
Fred, I am trying to die without
ever having another orgasm.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.124
[doorbell rings]

00:25.626 --> 00:27.961
Well, look who's up
before the cartoons.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.197
Is the baby up yet?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.964
Up, shaved, showered,
and gone to work.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.934
He's in the nursery.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.636
That kid is always here!

00:35.669 --> 00:37.371
Well, he likes his cousin.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.407
He should be playing
with his friends.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.209
Every day, that kid
comes over here,

00:41.242 --> 00:44.278
and every day he's a little
stranger than the day before.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.280
Hey, you guys,
look what I did!

00:46.314 --> 00:50.584
JACKIE: [giggling]
Look at that, Fred.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.786
Oh-ho, what a clever boy.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.325
He's got our only
child in a cooking pot.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.227
Just let me have my pot.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.628
[laughing]

01:00.661 --> 01:03.231
Um, can I have that box?

01:03.264 --> 01:04.165
Why?

01:04.198 --> 01:05.399
Well, because
this kid at school

01:05.433 --> 01:06.734
taught me to eat cardboard.
Wanna see?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.402
I can eat the whole
box in, like, an hour.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.904
Oh, well, DJ, if you're
hungry, just go in the kitchen

01:10.938 --> 01:13.107
and get some of those
rice cakes in there.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.143
They taste just like
cardboard, and they

01:15.176 --> 01:16.177
won't bind you up so bad.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.010
OK.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.184
I think there is something
really wrong with that kid.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.619
No, I-- I can't
keep him from coming

01:25.653 --> 01:27.955
here without hurting Roseanne.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.022
Oh, yeah.

01:29.056 --> 01:31.225
At least you got your
priorities straight.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.527
After all, Roseanne is
the father of your child.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.396
Oh, Fred, fine.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.665
If you're going to make a
federal case out of it, I--

01:37.698 --> 01:38.866
I will talk to her.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.834
Let me just think of a
very gentle way of telling

01:40.868 --> 01:42.270
Roseanne that you hate her son.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.937
I don't hate him.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.639
I just think he's
a little weird.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.041
Well, why do you have
to think of it that way.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.444
I don't know why you
can't appreciate him

01:50.478 --> 01:52.213
the way my family always has.

01:58.852 --> 01:59.887
You have a headache, DJ?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.322
Huh, not yet!

02:04.892 --> 02:08.296
[theme music]

02:48.302 --> 02:50.204
[laughs]

02:55.309 --> 02:56.844
(MOUTH FULL) Hold on!

02:56.877 --> 02:58.712
Mark's out of town and
Darlene is coming home.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.781
It's the perfect time for
me to visit Aunt Jackie.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.049
It's your mother's
birthday, Sunday.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.284
You're not going anywhere.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.184
Bye.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.353
Sit down, Becky.

03:08.289 --> 03:12.293
Now, look, your mom doesn't
want much for her birthday--

03:12.326 --> 03:16.830
a new pair of shoes, dinner in
a nice restaurant, daughters who

03:16.864 --> 03:19.400
get along, because let's
be honest, the first two

03:19.433 --> 03:21.569
are a pipe dream.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.903
Look, I meant what I told her.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.605
I think she's a cold-hearted
brat who doesn't

03:24.638 --> 03:27.107
care about anyone but herself.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.977
Look, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

03:30.010 --> 03:31.779
but when I was talking to
Darlene about coming home

03:31.812 --> 03:35.983
this weekend, she
was actually crying.

03:36.016 --> 03:38.419
She thinks you hate her.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.987
Really?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.522
Darlene was crying?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.624
And not just a little.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.125
Remember that time
when she was 10

03:45.158 --> 03:48.596
and we told her that
she wasn't adopted?

03:48.629 --> 03:49.430
Like that.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.502
Wow, I didn't know.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.437
Hey, dad, is the
box the refrigerator

03:56.470 --> 03:57.738
came in still in the garage?

03:57.771 --> 04:00.474
DJ, do me a favor and don't
eat the refrigerator box.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.276
Why don't you go
upstairs and unpack?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.110
OK.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.881
Hey, what's that
suitcase made out of?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.284
Go.

04:10.318 --> 04:13.220
Why can't I eat the box
the refrigerator came in?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.056
Because eating cardboard
can ruin your life.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.626
You could end up in the
street living in a box.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.160
Then you'll eat the box,
and you'll be homeless.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.731
I'm home.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.472
Oh, dad, I just feel so bad.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.706
It's OK, little girl.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.675
We'll get through it.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.978
I just couldn't believe
it when I got your message.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.547
How did Nana Mary die?

04:39.580 --> 04:42.616
Oh, it was just
something fatal.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.185
I'm just so glad you're home.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.987
Dad, well, of course I'm home.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.389
I mean, what do you think of me?

04:48.422 --> 04:49.289
Oh.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.924
Well, I didn't know.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.726
I mean, you wouldn't come
home for your mom's birthday

04:52.760 --> 04:53.927
because you were
so mad at Becky.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.630
Yeah, but this is like
a whole different thing.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.832
I mean, my great
grandmother's dead.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.902
Darlene, I've got
some happy news.

05:01.935 --> 05:02.970
Nana Mary's alive!

05:06.006 --> 05:06.940
What?

05:06.974 --> 05:07.841
She's not even sick.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.978
Isn't that great?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.446
Wait.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.848
I-- I can't believe that you
faked my great grandmother's

05:14.882 --> 05:17.250
death just to get me home.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.252
That's horrible.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.188
That's disgusting.

05:21.221 --> 05:24.257
That's like something
mom would do.

05:24.291 --> 05:27.027
Yeah, thanks.

05:27.060 --> 05:31.031
Actually, I kind of thought
of it as a present for her.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.167
Look, Darlene, it's
good to have you home.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.369
No matter what I
said to you before,

05:35.403 --> 05:37.337
I'm still your big sister.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.540
Actually, Becky, I think
of you more as a big cyst.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.612
You told me she
came home to make up.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.713
Oh, I did.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.348
I came home to make
up the list of losers.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.617
Let's see.

05:49.650 --> 05:54.287
There's you, and your
husband, and well, that's it.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.726
That's enough, both of you.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.061
Now, I want you two
to make and get along.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.430
Oh, forget this.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.598
I'm not staying here
if no one's dead.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.634
And brain dead doesn't count.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.569
You're not going anywhere.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.439
Now, look, I can't make you two
guys really like each other,

06:11.472 --> 06:13.240
but it's your mom's birthday.

06:13.273 --> 06:15.409
And I can damn sure make
you fake it for her.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.844
Oh, this is insane.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.311
Yeah, maybe so, but
get your coats on.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.313
We have a little show to
put on for your mother.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.082
Fine, bitch.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.216
Skag.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.384
Nice hair.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.719
Nice life.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.620
Go to hell.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.122
Go to the mall.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.190
We can rehearse
more in the car.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.602
Hey, honey, look who came
home to celebrate your birthday.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.336
Aw, isn't that great?

06:43.370 --> 06:46.173
How did you keep them from
fighting on the way over?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.976
You used that old trick where
you put one in the front seat

06:49.009 --> 06:51.845
and one in the trunk.

06:51.879 --> 06:52.746
Fighting?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.782
Oh, no, not these two angels.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.116
Watch this, honey.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.453
Becky, don't you have
something to say to Darlene?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.288
I love you.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.592
Darlene, don't you have
something to say to Becky?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.425
I love you more.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.730
That's so wonderful, Dan.

07:09.763 --> 07:14.101
You've gotten our
two daughters stoned.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.538
Nope, just sat 'em down and
gave 'em a good talking to.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.039
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to hurry.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.941
The Lobo's only open
for another seven hours.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.078
I'm not buying it, you guys.

07:25.112 --> 07:29.983
Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie
look more in love than you.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.118
Well, that's it.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.521
You can stop pretending
that you don't hate me.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.223
Well, it's not that
I hate you, Becky.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.626
I just hate all vegetables.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.993
You're the vegetarian.

07:40.027 --> 07:40.828
Eat me.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.499
OK, so that's enough.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.168
Now, we have a
wonderful, loving family.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.604
And you two little bitches
are not going to ruin it.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.908
You're going to be
loving, caring sisters

07:54.942 --> 07:56.577
just like me and Jackie.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.845
Fine.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.246
I'll sleep with
every guy in town,

07:59.279 --> 08:00.480
and you can gain 400 pounds.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.620
You know, Roseanne,
that reminds me.

08:06.654 --> 08:10.390
Could you, um, tell
DJ to stop hanging

08:10.423 --> 08:11.959
around my place so much?

08:11.992 --> 08:12.960
Why?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.762
Well, the baby
could catch something.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.397
DJ must pick up a lot
of germs at school.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.832
Germs can't live on DJ.

08:18.866 --> 08:21.368
The lice eat 'em right up.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.435
No, I'm serious.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.271
Just tell him not to come by.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.876
- What's going on, Jackie?
- Nothing.

08:28.909 --> 08:33.246
It's-- uh, it's just DJ
sometimes gets on my nerves.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.447
Yeah?
So?

08:34.481 --> 08:35.783
Well, he gets on my nerves too.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.051
That's why I send him
over to your house.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.821
Well, he has been doing
some odd things lately,

08:40.854 --> 08:44.124
and I would just like
if you kept him away.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.960
Yeah, could you keep
him away from me too?

08:46.994 --> 08:48.295
Don't get me wrong.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.565
I like DJ, I just like him
more when I'm not around him.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.701
Hey, you like
him more than I do.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.668
So what?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.670
You don't like
your little nephew?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.005
You know, just
because you didn't

08:58.038 --> 09:01.875
meet him in a bar doesn't
mean that he's not a good guy?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.677
What are you getting
so defensive about?

09:03.711 --> 09:06.947
Well, you did just call her
son a mentally defective freak.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.249
I (LAUGHING) said
he was annoying.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.085
And now you're harping on it.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.086
Don't worry about it, Jackie.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.655
You won't ever have
to see DJ again.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.789
Roseanne!

09:15.823 --> 09:17.424
No, I'm not taking
the chance that you

09:17.457 --> 09:19.559
could hurt his feelings.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.728
It's going to be
bad enough when I

09:20.761 --> 09:23.163
tell him all the terrible
things you've said.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.064
Fine.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.866
Just-- ugh, I give up.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.868
I never meant to hurt DJ.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.402
Oh, you think
your kid's so great.

09:29.436 --> 09:32.072
Well, at least my kid
doesn't crap in his pants.

09:43.216 --> 09:48.188
You know, Leon, uh,
I'd be happy to drop

09:48.221 --> 09:50.257
that off at the bank for you and
you know, you could close up.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.060
[scoffs] Right.

09:53.093 --> 09:56.630
That's just what I should do--
give Roseanne's daughter all

09:56.664 --> 09:58.498
the money to the restaurant.
[register chimes]

09:58.531 --> 10:00.868
And then later I'll
ask your mother

10:00.901 --> 10:03.036
if she'll guard my pork for me.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.041
Hey, Darlene.

10:08.075 --> 10:08.876
Hey.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.414
Do you mind if I sit here?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.615
I don't know.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.117
It might be a little
easier for me to ignore you

10:17.150 --> 10:17.951
if you stayed over there.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.756
Uh, listen, last
time you were home, I--

10:22.790 --> 10:26.126
I said some things that were
kind of harsh about, uh,

10:26.159 --> 10:29.029
how you and I never connected.

10:29.062 --> 10:29.963
That's OK, David.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.966
I mean, I kind of
agreed with you.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.867
Oh.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.535
Really?

10:35.568 --> 10:36.870
Well, still, I
mean, I might have

10:36.904 --> 10:41.008
gone a little overboard when
I called you cold and mean.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.209
Well, don't worry
about it, David.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.944
I mean, let's face
it, our relationship

10:43.977 --> 10:44.812
was a bit of a joke.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.717
Well, I don't know
if I would go that far.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.119
Well, it's not like we ever
really talked, or opened up,

10:52.152 --> 10:53.586
or anything.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.588
God knows the sex was
pretty pathetic, huh?

10:59.059 --> 11:00.427
Well, I held back
a lot because I

11:00.460 --> 11:01.494
didn't want to intimidate you.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.399
God, when I think of how
hot the sex is with Jimmy,

11:06.433 --> 11:07.801
it really makes me laugh.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.202
[laughs]

11:09.236 --> 11:12.139
[chuckles] Got to go.

11:12.172 --> 11:16.643
Uh, I'll see you later, OK?

11:16.676 --> 11:19.279
Listen, Darlene, I-- I really
am glad that you found somebody

11:19.312 --> 11:20.180
that you can get close to.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.388
[sighs]

11:31.859 --> 11:33.727
Oh, hey.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.195
I thought you left early.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.831
No, I just stayed
to cut some onions,

11:37.865 --> 11:41.401
and I just started thinking
about all the people

11:41.434 --> 11:42.402
that don't have onions.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.373
Oh, come on, Jackie.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.309
Mom's going to forgive
you for calling DJ weird.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.210
No way.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.579
You can't help me.

11:52.612 --> 11:54.247
Yeah, that's right,
I can't help you.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.184
I'd be a terrible person
for anyone to confide in.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.485
What?

11:58.518 --> 12:00.821
Well, I'm a cold
and unfeeling person

12:00.854 --> 12:02.856
who can't get close to anybody.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.157
Darlene, that's
not what I'm saying.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.225
Oh, yeah, right.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.360
Darlene, what do
you-- what do you mean

12:07.394 --> 12:09.096
you can't get close to anybody?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.664
You've been seeing
Jimmy for months.

12:11.698 --> 12:12.800
Yeah, we broke up.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.967
Oh-oh.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.636
I lied.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.171
He dumped me.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.974
Apparently, he couldn't
get close to me either.

12:21.008 --> 12:25.445
Well, did you ever have a dog?

12:28.782 --> 12:30.350
Yeah, thanks, Aunt Jackie.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.988
Darlene, I was crying because
I lied to your mother about DJ.

12:35.022 --> 12:35.856
What?

12:35.889 --> 12:36.790
Yes.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.125
(SOBBING) I do like DJ.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.629
Uh, yeah.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.866
I mean, that would upset me too.

12:45.899 --> 12:51.271
(SOBBING) It's Fred who
thinks that DJ is weird.

12:51.304 --> 12:52.439
Wait.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.441
So then why are you
taking the blame for Fred?

12:54.474 --> 12:57.110
Because Fred and
your mother both

12:57.144 --> 12:59.246
want to be the most
important person in my life.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.448
If your mother knew
that Fred wanted this,

13:01.481 --> 13:03.984
then she would want me
to choose her over him.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.285
Oh.

13:05.318 --> 13:10.190
But now she hates me, and
I hate it when she hates me.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.493
I'm sorry.

13:13.526 --> 13:18.398
So do you feel better
that I confided in you?

13:18.431 --> 13:21.401
Yeah, I do.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.402
'Cause I feel better too.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.236
Oh-oh-oh.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.376
Uh, would you stop
if I gave you a hug?

13:29.409 --> 13:31.778
[whimpering]

13:45.725 --> 13:46.693
[door opens]

13:47.560 --> 13:48.428
I'm sorry.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.163
I know, I better hurry up.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.365
Dinner out with Jackie and Fred.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.168
Where's my fancy eatin' pants?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.237
No, we're not going to
go out with those two.

13:57.270 --> 14:01.041
I just had a big fight with
Jackie about DJ being weird.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.743
Which side did you take?

14:03.776 --> 14:05.712
Which side do you think?

14:05.745 --> 14:08.715
You said he wasn't?

14:08.748 --> 14:11.018
She thinks that he's so weird
that she doesn't even want

14:11.051 --> 14:12.285
him around her house anymore.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.354
Oh, my god, this
is serious, Roseanne.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.456
We got to do something.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.457
I know.

14:17.490 --> 14:20.227
He won't go around
her house anymore.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.262
[sighs] DJ, come down here.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.330
Well, fine.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.465
Then you sit your
teenage son down here,

14:25.498 --> 14:27.034
and you tell him that
his aunt just doesn't

14:27.067 --> 14:28.068
want him around anymore.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.402
And while you're at
it, why don't you

14:29.436 --> 14:33.073
just tell him that there's
no such thing as Santa Claus?

14:33.106 --> 14:33.974
Yeah?

14:34.007 --> 14:34.975
Sit down, son.

14:38.345 --> 14:42.082
Listen, Deej, we think
you should spend more

14:42.115 --> 14:44.084
time here and less at Jackie's.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.852
How come?

14:45.885 --> 14:49.322
Well, uh, because your Aunt
Jackie's been real busy lately,

14:49.356 --> 14:53.626
cooking, and cleaning,
and hating the innocent.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.695
Doesn't Aunt Jackie
want me to come over?

14:55.728 --> 15:00.367
Oh, well, sometimes grown-ups
like your Aunt Jackie--

15:04.304 --> 15:07.474
we just miss you around here!

15:07.507 --> 15:11.211
What do you want to go
over there for anyway?

15:11.244 --> 15:12.946
Well, I have to go over there.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.481
Why?

15:14.514 --> 15:17.550
Well, you see, Becky
and Darlene are sisters,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.786
and mom and Aunt
Jackie are sisters,

15:19.819 --> 15:23.356
and Mark and David are
brothers, and mom's

15:23.390 --> 15:25.125
new baby's going to be a girl.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.427
So I'm the only one who
can be Andy's brother.

15:27.460 --> 15:30.130
He needs me.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.965
Oh.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.467
Well, go on, big guy.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.436
Why don't you just
take Tiny Tim's crutch

15:36.469 --> 15:39.939
and beat him over
the head with it?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.609
No, I'm going to go find
the other kids and tell them

15:42.642 --> 15:45.812
DJ's my favorite.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.647
Doesn't Aunt Jackie
like me anymore?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.016
Yeah, of course she likes you.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.251
She likes you a lot.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.820
In fact, she's worried
that Andy might

15:53.853 --> 15:55.488
even get jealous about it.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.724
So you know, next time you're
there playing with Andy,

15:57.757 --> 16:01.328
if Aunt Jackie tells you that
you're hanging around too much,

16:01.361 --> 16:02.862
just play along with it.

16:02.895 --> 16:06.166
You know, tell her to shut
up, and then wink at her.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.901
OK!

16:08.935 --> 16:11.838
Mom, you shouldn't have told
DJ he could play with Andy.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.406
Well, Jackie's just
being a big idiot.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.841
Andy's not going to get hurt.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.477
Well, it's not Aunt Jackie's
fault. She doesn't mind DJ.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.379
What are you talking about?

16:19.412 --> 16:20.947
Well, Jackie told
me that it's Fred

16:20.980 --> 16:22.315
that doesn't want DJ around.

16:22.349 --> 16:25.018
She's just going along with him.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.753
She is dead.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.188
What, you're going
to go over there

16:28.221 --> 16:30.857
and yell at her for taking
Fred's side over yours?

16:30.890 --> 16:33.260
No, I'm going to yell
at her for lying to me.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.327
Bull.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.795
For the first time
in her life, Jackie's

16:35.828 --> 16:38.298
putting Fred before you,
and you can't stand that.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.134
You think she should always
put you before her own husband.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.235
I do not.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.671
I wouldn't even think
anything like that.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.972
Actually, mom,
Darlene's right.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.376
I mean, you always want me
to put you in front of Mark.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.677
That is not true.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.713
What I said was we should
put Mark in front of a bus.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.818
Mark getting hit by a bus.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.553
Doesn't she have any feelings?

17:00.587 --> 17:03.390
Doesn't she realize how many
people would be late for work?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.560
Fine, Darlene.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.663
I'm sorry I tried to help you.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.965
Wait.

17:12.999 --> 17:16.836
Um, never mind.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.737
Keep going.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.571
Wait.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.643
You're welcome.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.644
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Thank you.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.887
What are you doing here?

17:34.921 --> 17:36.223
Oh.

17:36.256 --> 17:41.261
Well, there's just this question
that's been bothering me.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.664
OK, if me and Fred were
in a terrible accident,

17:44.697 --> 17:46.566
and we both needed
a kidney, and you

17:46.599 --> 17:52.405
had the kidney to give, where
would you want Fred buried?

17:52.439 --> 17:54.374
Did Darlene talk to you?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.942
Yes.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.610
I can't believe that
you really think

17:57.644 --> 17:59.346
that I would expect to
be more important to you

17:59.379 --> 18:00.247
than your own husband.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.514
I'd never do that.

18:01.548 --> 18:06.119
Roseanne, you wanted to
stand between us at the altar.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.987
Well, that was a joke!

18:08.020 --> 18:10.390
I know you have to put
your husband before me.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.259
I don't like it,
but I accept it.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.726
All right, thanks.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.395
[groans]

18:15.428 --> 18:16.296
[sighs]

18:16.329 --> 18:17.197
All right.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.331
Come on, we're all right.

18:18.365 --> 18:19.732
Cheer up.

18:19.766 --> 18:24.271
Hey, hey, mom's got a mole that
changed colors twice this week.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.073
It's not us that
I'm worried about.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.475
I'm worried about me and Fred.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.376
Why?

18:29.409 --> 18:30.710
What do you mean?

18:30.743 --> 18:34.046
[sighs] Whenever I have to
choose between you and Fred,

18:34.080 --> 18:36.649
I always want to choose you.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.920
That's terrible.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.190
It It's terrible, Roseanne.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.858
Fred thinks that I always put
you before him, and he's right.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.395
What does that say
about my marriage?

18:48.428 --> 18:50.096
I know you always put Dan first.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.331
That's not true, Jackie.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.300
I'm just as bad as you.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.802
I put me first too.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.737
I'm in big trouble, Roseanne.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.639
Fred thinks that he should
be the most important person

18:59.672 --> 19:01.841
in the world to
me, and until I can

19:01.874 --> 19:05.845
give him that, things aren't
going to be OK between us.

19:05.878 --> 19:06.979
Hey, Roseanne.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.715
You parked in my spot.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.518
Hi, Fred.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.787
I suppose you want me to
move it for him, right, Jackie?

19:14.821 --> 19:15.788
What?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.524
Of course I'll
move my car for him.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.726
And I'll keep my kid
out of here for him.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.028
Anything else I can
do for him, Jackie?

19:22.061 --> 19:25.832
Well, Roseanne, I
have to put him first.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.500
He is my husband.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.468
But Jackie.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.938
No, no, I took vows.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.173
Thanks, Jackie.

19:34.207 --> 19:39.111
Roseanne, I'm sorry, but
this was bound to happen.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.214
I know.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.950
But you've got to understand,
Fred, she's not just my sister,

19:43.983 --> 19:46.353
she's my best friend.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.088
This hurts.

19:49.121 --> 19:53.360
Man, I didn't
want to hurt you.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.994
That's OK, Fred.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.298
I still have my work.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.333
W-- w-- well, wait a minute.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.636
You know, Jackie,
maybe DJ can come over.

20:03.670 --> 20:04.537
No, no.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.705
Fred, you don't want him.

20:05.738 --> 20:06.673
End of story.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.441
No, no, no, no,
no, he's a good kid.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.578
He could come over
every once in a while.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.679
Thank you, Fred.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.747
Four or five times a week tops.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.215
I promise.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.117
Oh, great.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.287
Hey, why don't we go out
to dinner like we planned?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.689
No, Roseanne, Fred
really doesn't want to!

20:25.958 --> 20:28.060
OK.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.096
Well, I guess I'll just go
home and spend some quality

20:30.129 --> 20:32.799
time with my husband,
though I'm not

20:32.832 --> 20:35.568
sure our marriage can take it.

20:35.602 --> 20:36.936
Oh, wait a minute, no, no.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.771
It's not that I didn't want
to go out with you and Dan.

20:38.805 --> 20:41.641
It's just that I
didn't want to go out.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.009
Well, maybe we
could just eat here.

20:43.042 --> 20:46.379
If that's OK with you, Fred.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.647
OK.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.048
Well, great.
I'll tell you what.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.317
Why don't you give Dan a call?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.518
And tell him to bring DJ too.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.490
Wow.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.501

21:08.535 --> 21:11.504
Hey, how you doing?

21:11.538 --> 21:12.405
I'm DJ.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.506
What's your name?

21:13.540 --> 21:14.507
[laughs]

21:15.708 --> 21:18.010
Well, I know I may
not look like much now,

21:18.044 --> 21:21.381
but in a few years, I'm
gonna look like this.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.585
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Hi, DJ.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.454
I'm Jennifer.

21:27.487 --> 21:29.589
Cardboard, it
does a body good.
