NEWS ANCHOR: Breaking news from California,

00:24.372 --> 00:27.766
at the Metropolitan Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.507
A now familiar scene,

00:29.551 --> 00:31.379
an officer accused
of the shooting

00:31.422 --> 00:33.729
of an unarmed
African-American male

00:33.772 --> 00:37.863
in the Southwest Division
last August has been
found not guilty.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.169
The officer involved

00:39.213 --> 00:41.693
fatally shot
a 19-year-old victim...

00:41.737 --> 00:43.086
Hey, Pops.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.696
...after a chase
over a suspected drug deal.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.176
The officer claimed he thought

00:46.220 --> 00:47.830
the victim was reaching
for a gun in his car...

00:47.873 --> 00:49.658
Can I get a coffee?

00:49.701 --> 00:50.963
It's not working, man.
...which turned out
to be his wallet.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.227
What?

00:53.270 --> 00:54.576
Prosecutors accused
the officers of entering
into a conspiracy...

00:54.619 --> 00:56.099
Then let me get
a medium Coke.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.058
...with other officers
to plant misleading evidence

00:58.101 --> 01:00.190
at the scene,
including a weapon.

01:00.234 --> 01:04.151
All across the city
and the nation,
including Swinton,

01:04.194 --> 01:05.761
spontaneous protests

01:05.804 --> 01:07.763
have erupted to decry
the verdict,

01:07.806 --> 01:10.809
as well as to protest
police violence.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.247
At the courthouse,
activists gathered outside

01:13.290 --> 01:15.771
and marched through downtown.

01:15.814 --> 01:20.384
Various peaceful protests
escalated, as objects
were thrown at City Hall,

01:20.428 --> 01:23.126
as well as several
police vehicles.

01:23.170 --> 01:25.911
At least 14 people
were arrested.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.827
Three officers have been
treated for wounds,
including one...

01:28.871 --> 01:30.394
POPS: You're not welcome
here today, Kevin.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.267
Not today, man.

01:41.753 --> 01:42.885
KEVIN: Was she amazing?

01:42.928 --> 01:46.193
Oh, that's my baby.
That's my princess.

01:46.236 --> 01:49.935
Was it the blue dress?
I know.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.155
I know. I know.
I wish I could be there, too.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.549
There's a lot going on,
all right? You know.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.986
I'm doing this for us.
It'll all be over soon enough.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.597
I won't miss anything else.

02:01.164 --> 02:03.079
Okay, I love you,
too, baby.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.474
Hey, baby. I gotta go.
All right? Bye.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.134
Dispatch, this is
18-Lincoln-4. Over.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.787
DISPATCHER:
18-Lincoln-4, go ahead.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.007
Central, show me
with a car pull-over

02:18.050 --> 02:20.270
at East 11th
and South Dakota.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.882
I have a green Chevy van
with left tail light out.

02:23.926 --> 02:26.320
No tags.
DISPATCHER:
10-4, 18-Lincoln-4.

03:18.459 --> 03:20.809
KEVIN: Ma'am, can you roll
your window down, please?

03:22.071 --> 03:24.247
Ma'am, roll your
window down now.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.954
Ma'am,
place your hands
on the steering wheel.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.434
Right now!

03:38.957 --> 03:41.612
Step out of the van!

03:41.656 --> 03:44.136
Exit the vehicle!
Get out of your vehicle now!

03:45.921 --> 03:48.097
Turn around! Turn around!

03:48.140 --> 03:50.926
Get your hands on the vehicle.
Put your hands in the air now.

03:50.969 --> 03:53.407
Put your hands
on the vehicle now!

03:53.450 --> 03:55.017
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

03:55.060 --> 03:56.453
Turn around now!

03:56.497 --> 03:58.542
Don't make me
hurt you, please.
Are you on...

03:58.586 --> 04:00.196
Get on the ground.
What is wrong...

04:55.382 --> 04:57.297
MAN: Some of this
may sound redundant.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.386
I appreciate your patience

04:59.429 --> 05:01.997
as we hammer through
these questions again, Renee.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.259
Please bear with me

05:03.303 --> 05:05.479
as the standard review questions are cursory.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.437
I just wanna dig in
one more time

05:07.481 --> 05:09.570
to what we've been
talking about over the week.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.877
Okay? Have you had any
trouble sleeping?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.053
RENEE: No.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.275
MAN: Any trouble
relating to people?

05:19.319 --> 05:20.320
RENEE: No.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.845
MAN: Have you had
violent impulses?

05:23.888 --> 05:25.194
RENEE: As we talked about,

05:25.237 --> 05:27.327
it was
a complicated situation.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.590
Renee, you struck
a civilian.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.766
People can say
whatever they want
about what happened.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.463
The administration
and the public

05:33.507 --> 05:35.117
saw your body cam
footage, Renee.

05:36.074 --> 05:37.772
They saw how you
handled that.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.774
Look, I gotta be
on point.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.036
I have to walk up
to strangers.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.038
Some of them are hostile.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.561
Can you handle
that stress?

05:49.174 --> 05:50.959
Have you moved on
from your son's death?

05:54.528 --> 05:59.402
I need to work.
I really need to work.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.235
Okay.

06:07.671 --> 06:08.933
I'm going to recommend you

06:08.977 --> 06:11.893
return to active duty
on nights again, okay?

06:11.936 --> 06:13.808
Yes. Thank you, sir.
Appreciate it.

06:13.851 --> 06:16.724
You can start the next shift.
Watch commander will pair you.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.831
KESPER: We had
an alley dump last night.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.093
Female, Latina, 20s.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.704
No ID, no suspects
at this time.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.053
So be on the lookout.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.534
Check with your CIs.
See if you can get anything.

06:44.578 --> 06:48.320
Also, with the acquittal
of our brother officers
yesterday,

06:48.364 --> 06:50.061
Mr. and Mrs. Public
are gonna be

06:50.105 --> 06:54.022
all out of sorts,
so be gracious. Courteous.

06:54.631 --> 06:55.719
Don't start shit.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.678
Good to see you.
KESPER: Stay poised.

06:57.721 --> 07:01.116
Also, let's welcome back
Officer Lomito.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.728
She is officially
back in the badge.

07:04.772 --> 07:05.947
And according to my notes,

07:05.990 --> 07:08.079
she's buying everybody
a beer after watch.

07:10.691 --> 07:13.868
Okay, that's it. Let's go
do work. Stay safe.

07:22.311 --> 07:25.967
RENEE: Sarge, you put me
with a rookie. Really?

07:26.010 --> 07:27.751
I get it. Help me out.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.495
Hey, come here.
Welcome back, lady.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.279
Thanks, Sarge.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.153
KESPER:
Don't slap anyone today.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.206
OFFICER 1: All right.
Here you go.

07:49.643 --> 07:50.992
OFFICER 2: Here you go.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.128
It might be crazy
out there tonight.

07:58.739 --> 07:59.783
Yes.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.393
I didn't know that
you scuba dived.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.831
KEVIN: I don't,
but I will.

08:08.357 --> 08:09.706
Just been itching
to get back on the job.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.881
Yeah.

08:10.925 --> 08:13.536
How's everything? Okay.
It's good.

08:15.886 --> 08:16.887
What up?

08:19.411 --> 08:21.109
What up?

08:21.152 --> 08:22.893
Danny Holledge?
Yeah. Officer Lomito?

08:22.937 --> 08:25.722
Yeah. We're partnering
together.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.638
Danny, this is Penda, Ganning,
Birke and Roberts.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.075
Oh, yeah. We know
this fuck-face.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.297
Ganning was his first CO.
Tried his best to break him.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.820
Holledge, you got yourself
a good babysitter.

08:38.605 --> 08:41.303
You got yourself squared?
Yep.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.349
All right, y'all be safe.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.874
PENDA: You be safe, Renee.
Thanks, guys.

08:46.917 --> 08:50.878
Hey, Danny.
Public's got no love
for us right now.

08:50.921 --> 08:51.966
Your head down,
your eyes open.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.184
Stay close to Renee.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.664
All right. Got it.
Head down, eyes open.

08:54.708 --> 08:55.926
But not too close.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.237
Can I go?
Yeah.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.546
If you're looking to make
a little extra cash, Danny,

09:06.589 --> 09:08.286
I could use somebody
to mow my lawn on Sunday.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.331
Fuck you.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.166
Fuck you, guys.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.646
You're welcome.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.212
BIRKE: Pink is your color.
PENDA: Can't be too careful.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.040
BIRKE: I mean, she punched
somebody in the face.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.389
ROBERTS:
Watch that right hook.

10:17.181 --> 10:18.443
DANNY: You know,
those guys back there,

10:18.487 --> 10:19.923
they're just, you know,
fucking around.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.492
They do really respect me.
They don't actually...

10:23.535 --> 10:27.104
You know, I'm not a baby,
I've been doing this
for a good minute.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.410
RENEE: Hmm...

10:31.065 --> 10:32.414
Should we put on some music,

10:32.457 --> 10:35.635
or are we just gonna
sit here in total silence?

10:37.375 --> 10:39.682
Hey, looks
like a kid.Yeah.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.459
What's up, little guy?

11:19.722 --> 11:23.726
Hey. Hi there.
It's okay, sweetie.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.249
DANNY:
What you doing out here?

11:25.293 --> 11:26.381
Just wanna
make sure you're okay.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.601
Calm down. It's okay.

11:29.645 --> 11:32.561
Hey. Take it easy.
We're good, we're good.

11:32.604 --> 11:35.303
Hey. Get away from him.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.652
WOMAN 2:
Come on, come inside.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.480
Sorry, ma'am. Just trying to
make sure he's okay.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.438
Mind your own damn business.
Come on, baby.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.918
DANNY: You got yourself
a little boy in the middle
of the...

11:41.962 --> 11:43.485
Hey, back up, back up.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.922
Back up, back up. Back up now.
MAN: What's happening here?

11:45.966 --> 11:48.098
RENEE: Everything's all right.
Everything's all right.

11:48.142 --> 11:51.406
Calm down. Just trying to
make sure the kid's all right.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.017
He was in the street.
Go back to your homes, okay?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.586
Hey.
Just relax.
Everything's good.

11:57.629 --> 11:58.674
Come on.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.026
The police, man
Useless, man.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.376
RENEE: Go back to your homes.
Everything is okay.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.769
Have a good night.

12:20.217 --> 12:22.176
That was good,
how you handled that, though.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.178
RENEE: Thanks.

12:24.221 --> 12:27.094
DISPATCHER: Dispatch to
18-Adam-7, come in. Over.Go for 18-Adam-7.

12:27.137 --> 12:31.272
18-Adam-7, code two,
East 11th and South Dakota,
18-Lincoln-4.

12:31.315 --> 12:33.578
Failure to respond.
We're code six.

12:33.622 --> 12:34.666
That's Ganning.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.407
Yeah.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.932
Dispatch, 18-Adam-7
en route to location.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.891
DISPATCHER: 18-Adam-7,
proceed with caution.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.981
RENEE: 18-Adam-7, responding. ETA, three minutes.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.557
He's probably
just fucking around.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.211
No, it's not like him.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.397
What the hell happened
to the street lights?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.095
Dispatch, this is 18-Adam-7.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.881
Spotted 18-Lincoln-4
on East 11th and South Dakota.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.273
The cruiser is down.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.493
DISPATCHER:
10-4, 18-Adam-7.
Rolling backup.

13:19.450 --> 13:20.451
18-Adam-9...

13:49.437 --> 13:50.438
Shit.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.445
Danny.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.449
Oh, shit.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.847
Fucking teeth?

14:30.913 --> 14:33.307
Not working.
Fucking thing is shot.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.091
Grab the big light,
check the north side.

14:38.703 --> 14:39.922
Send me more units.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.664
Still trying to locate
18-Lincoln-4. Over.

14:42.707 --> 14:43.883
DISPATCHER:
Copy, 18-Adam-7.

14:51.020 --> 14:51.978
KEVIN: Hey.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.420
Hey. Hey.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.335
Holledge.
KEVIN: Hands on
the steering wheel.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.293
Put your hands
on the steering wheel.

15:03.337 --> 15:04.773
Get out
of the vehicle now.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.994
Ma'am, get out
of your vehicle now.

15:09.560 --> 15:10.953
Green van, no plates.

16:05.529 --> 16:06.704
Oh, my God. Kevin.

16:42.871 --> 16:43.872
Danny.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.052
DANNY: You got something?

16:54.100 --> 16:55.318
RENEE: There's gotta be
a way in here.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.850
What the hell? Shit.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.727
So what do we got?

18:39.770 --> 18:41.816
Green Chevy van.
No plates.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.035
Ganning pulled
the vehicle over.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.255
Pulls his weapon on
a female, black, 30s.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.214
Whoa, whoa,
the driver?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.303
RENEE: I'm not sure.
The footage cut out.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.131
The footage
doesn't exist, Renee.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.610
IT said that
the card got fried

18:53.654 --> 18:55.046
when Ganning's car
got hit.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.483
I saw that footage, sir.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.966
So who hit his car?
The green van?

19:03.751 --> 19:07.668
Ganning's body cam
got fried, too. It's blank.

19:07.711 --> 19:12.194
Kesper, so these two
were the primary unit
that took the call?

19:12.238 --> 19:13.935
We saw a black female, 30s.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.503
So one woman did all this?

19:16.546 --> 19:18.853
Is that why you screwed
around with the dash cam?

19:18.896 --> 19:21.682
You know protocol.
It's evidence, Officer.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.553
By touching it,
you're interfering
with the crime scene.

19:23.597 --> 19:24.728
Sarge...

19:24.772 --> 19:27.035
Okay, okay.
I'll meet you back there.

19:27.078 --> 19:28.602
HAYES:
If you wanna help Ganning,

19:28.645 --> 19:30.473
write up what you saw
while it's still fresh
in your mind.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.519
DANNY:
This is fucking bullshit.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.348
RENEE: Come on, man.
Let's go. Let's get a drink.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.239
DANNY: Thank you, hon.

20:04.855 --> 20:05.900
Bourbon, rocks.

20:07.118 --> 20:10.470
Thanks, man.
What you drinking?

20:10.513 --> 20:11.471
Club soda.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.257
Shit. Ganning was
my first partner.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.957
I can't fucking believe
that he's dead. It's crazy.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.176
I mean, who the fuck
would do

20:21.220 --> 20:23.134
something like that
to him? It's bullshit.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.658
And it doesn't make
any sense.

20:24.701 --> 20:25.789
No, it doesn't make
any sense.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.008
Doesn't give you
any faith in humanity.

20:28.749 --> 20:29.880
And that fucking detective

20:29.924 --> 20:31.491
telling us that
we can go home?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.623
Yeah, I know. How could
I tell her what I saw?

20:35.625 --> 20:38.237
The whole department's
just waiting for me
to fuck up again.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.021
Why?

20:40.804 --> 20:42.371
'Cause I hit a guy.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.373
Yeah, I saw
that video, too.

20:44.765 --> 20:45.766
Shit.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.639
Everybody's seen
that video.Yeah.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.212
That guy, he just
wouldn't shut up.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.781
He just kept talking
and talking.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.480
Just being disrespectful,
you know?

21:04.524 --> 21:05.916
What was he saying?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.179
He said some shit like,
"You black bitch."

21:10.051 --> 21:11.052
And I blacked out.

21:12.749 --> 21:13.750
Lost it.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.492
Body cam footage
was all they needed

21:16.536 --> 21:18.146
to take me off the street
for eight months.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.541
I mean, listen,
I'm not unstable.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.934
I was going through
a lot. I lost my son.

21:26.154 --> 21:27.155
Shit.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.118
He drowned
in our neighbor's pool.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.520
I'm sorry about that.

21:55.531 --> 21:58.229
GARY: Hey, my queen.
RENEE: Hey.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.018
You're home early.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.806
What happened? What?

22:09.850 --> 22:12.592
Ganning.
He was killed.

22:15.769 --> 22:16.987
Oh, my God.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.388
I'm so sorry.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.391
Are you okay?
No.

22:33.221 --> 22:37.921
I feel almost
out of touch with reality.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.532
I can't even explain
what I saw.

22:42.012 --> 22:45.799
Something terrible happened,
and I have to find out why.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.802
Wait. It's your
first day back.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.806
Can't they put
someone else on it?

22:54.851 --> 22:58.855
This man was
like my brother.

23:01.684 --> 23:06.210
You're too close to Ganning,
or Christopher.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.824
It's all just too much.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.087
I can't have another person
close to me die,

23:14.915 --> 23:16.525
without trying
to do something.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.573
I felt so helpless
with Christopher.

23:20.616 --> 23:21.878
I still feel helpless.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.750
I've got to
do something.Hey.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.931
Don't worry.
You're not alone.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.426
CHRISTOPHER: Mom!

23:48.296 --> 23:49.863
Mom!

23:49.906 --> 23:52.692
KEVIN: Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!

23:52.735 --> 23:55.825
Place your hands on the wheel. Step out of the van!

23:57.261 --> 23:58.654
Will you roll
your window down?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.049
Ma'am, get out
of the vehicle now!

25:00.411 --> 25:02.326
Dispatch, this is
18-Adam-7.

25:02.370 --> 25:05.852
Need a DMV check on
a Taneesha Branz. Age, 34.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.637
DISPATCHER: Copy that.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.944
That woman on
Ganning's dash cam,
I might know who she is.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.164
This was on her scrubs.

25:14.208 --> 25:16.819
DANNY: What is it?
It's Swinton Hospital.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.386
I remember it when
I had my son there.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.736
Checked the staff website.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.999
She hasn't worked there
in six months.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.653
DISPATCHER:
18-Adam-7, Taneesha Branz,

25:24.697 --> 25:27.526
1733 North Dorgenois.
No wants. No warrants.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.398
RENEE: Copy that.

25:49.765 --> 25:50.723
Lomito.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.292
No, leave it off for now.
It's my business.

26:27.281 --> 26:29.239
RENEE: For Taneesha Branz.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.371
This was sent
like a month ago.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.858
RENEE: Taneesha Branz?

26:49.303 --> 26:51.958
There's gotta be
another way in.
Let's try the side.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.163
DANNY: You see anything?

27:23.206 --> 27:24.164
RENEE:
Just a bunch of clothes.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.031
Lomito?

28:06.336 --> 28:08.034
RENEE: It's open.
Come on.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.918
Oh, shit.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.190
There's nothing.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.298
RENEE: Look for any evidence

28:55.342 --> 28:57.126
linking her
to Ganning's murder.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.127
DANNY: Okay.

29:20.280 --> 29:21.585
This must be her son.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.532
RENEE: What the hell?

31:37.896 --> 31:38.897
RENEE: You hear that?

31:52.432 --> 31:53.824
DANNY: We need to
get out of here, Renee.

31:55.870 --> 31:56.915
RENEE:
Someone's in here.

33:31.922 --> 33:32.923
Fuck!

33:37.841 --> 33:41.106
All right, Lomito,
I'm out of here. Fuck this.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.813
Holledge, is that you
running around upstairs?

33:56.599 --> 33:57.948
DANNY:
I'm outside.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.733
There's nobody in there. I don't see anybody in there.

34:06.957 --> 34:08.002
Police officer.
Who's there?

34:54.788 --> 34:56.137
RENEE: See anyone?

34:56.181 --> 34:57.573
DANNY: No,
I didn't see anybody.

34:57.617 --> 35:00.489
I just had like 1000
fucking cockroaches

35:00.533 --> 35:02.796
fly at me.
I'm feeling like...

35:02.839 --> 35:04.363
What?
Crazy.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.018
I don't know
how I feel about this.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.324
You know,
you checking out
your own leads.

35:09.368 --> 35:12.197
I don't know really if I can
do this. It's like...

35:12.240 --> 35:14.590
I think it's kind of
freaking me out.

35:14.634 --> 35:18.116
RENEE: You gotta
trust me. Okay?

35:21.684 --> 35:23.382
Okay,
I trust you.

35:23.425 --> 35:24.861
Okay?
Let's go.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.779
Fucking roaches, man.
I'd rather get shot at.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.155
MAN 1: Yeah, I want
my fucking money.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.330
I want my fucking money.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.984
I'm telling you,
I want my money.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.073
You stupid ass.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.379
How you gonna steal
a stick-shift when
you can't drive?

36:48.162 --> 36:49.250
You wanna ride people.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.991
You can't do that, dude.

36:51.034 --> 36:52.819
MAN 2:
Thinking for everybody.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.560

what kind of phone I got.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.257
Hey, buddy.

37:40.562 --> 37:43.043
Come on, man.
It's a neighborhood store.
Come on.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.786
I don't have
a charger, sir.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.570

I don't have any.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.007

Huh?

38:17.469 --> 38:19.166
Yo. Leave her alone.

47:32.327 --> 47:34.416
HAYES: So, apparently,
the security cameras

47:34.460 --> 47:36.462
in this place are
completely cosmetic,

47:36.505 --> 47:38.725
because there's nothing
on the cards. They're blank.

47:40.901 --> 47:43.773
I'd put out an APB
on a black woman, mid 30s.

47:43.817 --> 47:45.427
Someone you saw
on the scene?

47:45.471 --> 47:47.647
RENEE: I'm thinking
it's the same woman
from Ganning's dash cam.

47:49.214 --> 47:50.389
Did you see a woman here?

47:52.739 --> 47:53.914
Um...

47:54.480 --> 47:56.003
No.

47:56.047 --> 47:59.224
Okay, listen. This is
what we've got so far.

47:59.267 --> 48:01.400
We ran the VIN number
on the van.

48:01.443 --> 48:04.446
It's the property
of the pastor of
a church on Gaskell.

48:04.490 --> 48:06.187
We questioned him
after Ganning's murder,

48:06.231 --> 48:09.669
and he said that his van
completely disappeared.

48:09.712 --> 48:12.150
We figure that the perps
that were in there got it,

48:12.193 --> 48:15.153
Ganning tried to bust them,
and they killed him.

48:15.196 --> 48:19.113
It appears that Roberts
and Birke found these guys.

48:19.157 --> 48:20.810
Did they say
how they were killed?

48:20.854 --> 48:22.377
Uh, no. We're still
working on it.

48:22.421 --> 48:23.596
We'll take it
from here.

48:27.730 --> 48:29.515
Renee.

48:29.558 --> 48:31.821
They're gonna try to pin
Ganning's murder on these two.

48:31.865 --> 48:33.127
That's good, right?

48:33.171 --> 48:34.302
Yeah, but they
weren't the ones

48:34.346 --> 48:36.435
driving the van
when he pulled it over.

48:36.478 --> 48:38.350
Taneesha Branz was.

48:38.393 --> 48:39.481
What are you talking about?

48:40.830 --> 48:42.615
Come on.

48:52.016 --> 48:55.497
What are you doing?
Did you take that?
Is that evidence?

48:55.541 --> 48:57.673
What are they
gonna say when you...

48:57.717 --> 48:58.979
What the fuck
are they gonna say

48:59.023 --> 49:00.546
when they find that
you're stealing evidence?

49:00.589 --> 49:02.504
You're the only one
that knows.No, I'm not doing this.

49:02.548 --> 49:03.810
Relax.
No, Renee.

49:03.853 --> 49:04.985
All right? You're
on your own trip.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.682
Fuck you.
No, fuck you.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.293
I think you're a mother
who lost her kid,

49:08.336 --> 49:10.121
and you've become obsessed
with some woman who lost hers.

49:10.164 --> 49:11.470
And now you're saying
a bunch of crazy shit.

49:11.513 --> 49:12.906
All this stuff
with this lady.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.909
They found their guys.
You need to fucking let it go.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.389
What the fuck
do you mean, "let it go"?

49:18.477 --> 49:19.652
Okay? Just leave it alone.

50:02.825 --> 50:05.524
Oh, hey, Renee.
How are you doing?

50:05.567 --> 50:06.742
I've been better.

50:06.786 --> 50:09.267
I hear that.
What can I do for you?

50:09.310 --> 50:11.965
You processed a couple
of bodies that came in.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.880
Couple of special ones.

50:13.923 --> 50:15.447
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

50:16.883 --> 50:18.015
Are you wanting
to see them?

50:19.668 --> 50:22.106
I can't do it.
It's not protocol.
I'll get in trouble.

50:24.847 --> 50:26.893
You can give me those
brown eyes all you want,

50:26.936 --> 50:28.329
but I'm telling you,
I just can't do it.

50:29.896 --> 50:32.638
Weren't you the one
that found them?Yeah.

50:32.681 --> 50:35.336
If I get in trouble,
I'm coming after you.

50:37.773 --> 50:38.861
Quite a mess.

50:42.648 --> 50:44.171
Well, here he is.

50:47.957 --> 50:51.265
You can see
how he's mangled.

50:51.309 --> 50:53.050
You can see
right around there,

50:53.093 --> 50:56.401
just teeth coming through
a cheek there, I think.
I don't know.

50:57.837 --> 50:59.621
But his associate
over here,

50:59.665 --> 51:01.580
that's a different story
altogether.

51:01.623 --> 51:02.972
Get a load of this shit.

51:05.192 --> 51:08.630
I get scalps coming in
in all kinds of conditions,

51:08.674 --> 51:10.545
but I've never had
anything come in
looking like this.

51:11.807 --> 51:13.722
Did they put in
what the official cause was?

51:13.766 --> 51:15.246
There's no official cause.

51:15.289 --> 51:17.944
They're gonna fly
a medical examiner in
from Chicago

51:17.987 --> 51:19.511
to look at these two guys,

51:19.554 --> 51:21.556
because everybody's pretty
fucked up about what happened.

51:22.905 --> 51:24.124
Mind if I get
a moment alone?

51:24.168 --> 51:25.125
Uh...

51:27.301 --> 51:32.132
Renee, this is my job,
and I love it for what it is.

51:32.176 --> 51:33.873
Look, I understand.

51:33.916 --> 51:35.918
I'm gonna give you
five minutes.

51:35.962 --> 51:38.921
But please don't
fuck anything up.
Don't take anything.

51:40.836 --> 51:42.011
And cut the lights off
when you leave.

51:42.055 --> 51:43.056
Cool.

51:46.625 --> 51:47.626
Hurry up.

52:25.403 --> 52:26.534
MAN 1: You think it's a game?

52:26.578 --> 52:27.927
You think
I won't kill her, huh?

52:27.970 --> 52:30.495
Let us out. Let me
and my boy out of here.

52:30.538 --> 52:31.583
You think it's a game?

52:31.626 --> 52:32.888
You think
I won't kill her, huh?

52:32.932 --> 52:36.457
Let us out. Let me
and my boy out of here.

52:49.427 --> 52:51.733
Let me and my boy out of here. You think it's a game?

52:51.777 --> 52:53.561
You think
I won't kill her, huh?
Let us out.

53:00.916 --> 53:02.788
You think
I won't kill her, huh?
Let us out.

53:09.011 --> 53:10.535
GARY: Babe?

53:10.578 --> 53:12.145
You coming up to bed?

53:12.189 --> 53:13.494
Yeah. I'll be up
in a minute.

53:13.538 --> 53:14.539
All right.

53:23.809 --> 53:24.810
RENEE: What the...

53:50.009 --> 53:52.185
CHRISTOPHER: No, you're
the coolest mom ever.

53:52.229 --> 53:54.622
I just really want
you to be safe, you know?

53:54.666 --> 53:58.104
You're always out there, and, you know, you have a gun,

53:58.147 --> 54:02.239
and people might hurt you. I don't want them to hurt you.

54:02.282 --> 54:05.024
Mom, I just wanna protect you, no matter what.

54:05.067 --> 54:08.114
I just wanna protect you,
but I can't.

54:09.507 --> 54:10.725
Nor can Dad.

54:13.119 --> 54:16.905
No one can. No one can.

54:16.949 --> 54:20.126
KESPER: In this job,
what matters is what
we do and how we do it.

54:21.736 --> 54:24.652
We're never gonna
get the respect we deserve,

54:24.696 --> 54:27.568
because nobody
outside this room knows
how hard this job is.

54:29.657 --> 54:31.790
Respect doesn't come
from out there.

54:32.921 --> 54:34.096
It comes from in here.

54:35.576 --> 54:38.623
This week, we lost
two more of our own.

54:38.666 --> 54:41.147
Officer Gabe Roberts
and Maria Birke.

54:43.323 --> 54:45.194
I know some of you
may despair,

54:45.238 --> 54:46.413
but let me remind you

54:47.893 --> 54:51.288
that when we're attacked,
we stand tall.

54:52.680 --> 54:56.162
We stand together.
And we are strong.

54:57.772 --> 54:59.600
Just a reminder that

54:59.644 --> 55:01.733
this weekend we have
the wake for Gabe and Maria,

55:03.561 --> 55:04.823
so I know
I'll see you all there.

55:08.696 --> 55:10.524
Okay, that's it.
Let's go. Be safe.

55:19.272 --> 55:22.623
KESPER: I'm sorry.
I know you've been
going through a lot.

55:24.321 --> 55:25.626
I got a lot of respect
for you.

55:28.237 --> 55:30.631
Mm-hmm.
I'm glad you're back.

55:34.113 --> 55:36.202
These times, we need
all of us together.

55:36.245 --> 55:38.335
You know, we're like a family.

55:38.378 --> 55:42.208
Whenever you need
an ear, I'm here. Okay?

55:46.473 --> 55:47.735
Excuse me.
Sure.

56:02.924 --> 56:03.882
RENEE: Hey, Penda.

56:05.536 --> 56:06.624
Hey, Renee.

56:08.408 --> 56:12.543
It's sad, huh?
Yeah. Everything all right?

56:12.586 --> 56:15.937
Remember the killing of a kid
named DeMarco Branz?

56:17.286 --> 56:19.767
Taneesha Branz
was his mother's name.

56:19.811 --> 56:21.465
That was a kid
in an empty lot.

56:22.988 --> 56:25.425
Looked like
a drive-by gang thing.

56:26.383 --> 56:27.688
We found him bled out.

56:29.473 --> 56:32.301
Pretty obvious
what happened.Right.

56:37.611 --> 56:38.569
Thank you.

56:42.486 --> 56:44.401
Danny.
Renee.

56:46.881 --> 56:50.189
Renee. You have
the best name, Renee.

56:50.232 --> 56:51.756
Did you know that
your name, Renee,

56:51.799 --> 56:55.281
is Kermit the Frog
in Spanish?

56:55.324 --> 56:56.804
So, they don't even have
a Kermit.

56:56.848 --> 56:58.458
They just have
a Renee the Frog.

57:01.026 --> 57:05.465
Ganning has a good name, too.
Ganning, Roberts, Birke.

57:09.251 --> 57:10.252
RENEE: Danny.

57:14.866 --> 57:17.129
Hey, hey, hey.
I wasn't ready for this.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.262
I wasn't ready
for any of this shit.

57:23.309 --> 57:25.267
I thought that
I was ready, but I wasn't.

57:26.921 --> 57:29.054
There's a lot going on
right now. Just...

57:29.097 --> 57:30.447
What's going on
with you?

57:32.144 --> 57:33.580
What happened
to the club soda?

57:34.581 --> 57:36.148
No more alcohol.
Okay.

57:38.716 --> 57:39.717
Okay?

57:44.025 --> 57:45.331
MAN 1: Let me and
my boy out of here.

57:45.374 --> 57:46.680
You think it's a game?

57:46.724 --> 57:48.639
You think
I won't kill her, huh?
Let us out.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.732
Let me and my boy out of here.
You think it's a game?

57:54.775 --> 57:56.603
You think
I won't kill her, huh?
Let us out.

58:00.868 --> 58:02.435
Let me and my boy out of here.
You think it's a game?

58:02.479 --> 58:03.871
You think
I won't kill her, huh?

58:03.915 --> 58:05.003
Let us out.

59:15.639 --> 59:16.596
GARY: You okay, baby?

59:19.860 --> 59:21.862
RENEE:
Look, I'm sorry, Gary.

59:21.906 --> 59:23.037
I don't wanna stress you out

59:23.081 --> 59:24.778
with everything
that's happening to me.

59:37.399 --> 59:38.705
Let's just take care
of us right now.

59:40.011 --> 59:43.144
Go someplace peaceful,
a vacation or something.

59:44.842 --> 59:45.799
You know?

59:50.978 --> 59:52.806
Share the weight
with me, please.

59:56.636 --> 59:59.334
I feel like there's
a different reality
that only I can see.

1:00:02.990 --> 1:00:06.907
There's only one reality.
We share it.

1:00:11.346 --> 1:00:13.174
For all we know it,
could be stress.

1:00:14.567 --> 1:00:16.700
It's not stress.

1:00:16.743 --> 1:00:18.049
Yeah, after what
we went through,

1:00:18.092 --> 1:00:20.268
nobody expects us to be
rational through this.

1:00:23.968 --> 1:00:25.230
And I wanna help.

1:00:26.753 --> 1:00:27.885
You can't help.

1:00:29.669 --> 1:00:31.671
I gotta figure
this out on my own.

1:00:45.990 --> 1:00:49.646
DANNY: People are
talking about you.
They think you're losing it.

1:00:49.689 --> 1:00:52.649
And I'm scared for you.

1:00:54.781 --> 1:00:56.304
Everybody keeps saying,
you know,

1:00:56.348 --> 1:00:59.438
"She's chasing her own leads.
She's playing detective."

1:00:59.481 --> 1:01:02.920
Look, all these things
that keep happening,
they mean something.

1:01:02.963 --> 1:01:04.356
I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

1:01:04.399 --> 1:01:06.358
So am I. All right?

1:01:07.968 --> 1:01:10.405
Lomito, I'm just trying
to get through training,

1:01:10.449 --> 1:01:12.799
and keep my head down,
and not fuck anything up.

1:01:12.843 --> 1:01:14.322
And I'm trying to help you
save your job

1:01:14.366 --> 1:01:15.846
because I care about you.

1:01:15.889 --> 1:01:17.804
Okay?
Okay.

1:01:23.941 --> 1:01:24.942
Danny.

1:01:24.985 --> 1:01:25.986
Yeah.

1:01:27.205 --> 1:01:28.206
Look, I need you.

1:01:30.338 --> 1:01:31.862
In or out?

1:01:50.619 --> 1:01:53.100
Pierce, I need info.

1:01:55.233 --> 1:01:56.843
I need an address
from a detective's report

1:01:56.887 --> 1:01:59.454
that was filed from
Ganning's case.

1:01:59.498 --> 1:02:02.066
A church Hayes mentioned.
Can you help me out?

1:02:02.109 --> 1:02:03.284
The lou asked me
to do a follow-up.

1:02:03.328 --> 1:02:04.546
Just a couple
of questions.

1:02:04.590 --> 1:02:05.591
Okay.

1:02:06.940 --> 1:02:10.639
Ask me 'cause
I know everything.

1:02:10.683 --> 1:02:14.774
Thomas Cozzalio Jackson.
Over on East Adams.

1:02:30.442 --> 1:02:32.313
Officer,
how can I help you?

1:02:33.837 --> 1:02:35.360
You told our detectives
that a green van

1:02:35.403 --> 1:02:37.188
disappeared
off your property.

1:02:37.231 --> 1:02:38.667
It wasn't stolen, was it?

1:02:40.104 --> 1:02:41.583
You lent it
to Taneesha Branz.

1:02:44.021 --> 1:02:45.500
If you impede
an investigation,

1:02:45.544 --> 1:02:46.893
that's obstruction
of justice.

1:02:48.852 --> 1:02:51.680
Come to the back,
and we can speak properly.

1:02:54.074 --> 1:02:57.643
We've got about
20 kids in the program.

1:02:57.686 --> 1:02:59.384
This is the activity room.

1:03:07.392 --> 1:03:09.089
And this is the room

1:03:09.133 --> 1:03:11.439
where Taneesha used to take
her son, DeMarco.

1:03:16.618 --> 1:03:18.359
DeMarco was one
of the smartest kids

1:03:18.403 --> 1:03:20.709
we'd ever worked with.
Intense.

1:03:22.537 --> 1:03:24.801
Devoted to his mom,
who was maybe a little
too protective of him.

1:03:26.106 --> 1:03:27.064
They were close.

1:03:29.718 --> 1:03:30.719
Look at this.

1:03:37.248 --> 1:03:39.772
DeMarco couldn't hear.

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:42.775
But he was a resourceful child
who found ways to communicate.

1:03:43.776 --> 1:03:45.822
Fourteen years old,

1:03:45.865 --> 1:03:48.563
but there wasn't a day
he wasn't out
in this city somewhere,

1:03:48.607 --> 1:03:50.783
doing volunteer work
or community service.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:53.655
That's the kind of boy
that he was.

1:03:53.699 --> 1:03:56.267
Then he gets killed
by senseless violence.

1:03:57.877 --> 1:03:59.966
What do you think
that kind of loss
does to a mother?

1:04:03.100 --> 1:04:04.231
Where's Taneesha?

1:04:06.277 --> 1:04:07.756
She needs to get
off the street

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:09.280
before somebody else dies.

1:04:10.281 --> 1:04:11.456
And you'll help her?

1:04:12.152 --> 1:04:13.240
I'll do what I can.

1:05:44.810 --> 1:05:45.898
RENEE: Taneesha?

1:08:43.771 --> 1:08:45.904
KESPER:
This is Kesper.
Leave a message.

1:08:48.472 --> 1:08:51.866
Sarge, I need your help.
This is Renee. Hit me back.

1:09:01.311 --> 1:09:04.227
Hey, Renee. Hi.

1:09:04.270 --> 1:09:05.576
RENEE: Holledge.

1:09:06.838 --> 1:09:09.536
Listen to me. I need
to see you right now.

1:09:09.580 --> 1:09:11.625
Why?
RENEE: Not over the phone.

1:09:11.669 --> 1:09:13.758
I tracked down Taneesha.

1:09:13.801 --> 1:09:15.455
Penda may be involved
in some bad shit.

1:09:18.719 --> 1:09:19.764
Holledge.

1:09:19.807 --> 1:09:21.983
Okay. Okay.

1:09:22.549 --> 1:09:23.594
Give me an hour.

1:09:23.637 --> 1:09:25.204
All right.
Thanks, Danny.

1:10:11.903 --> 1:10:12.991
Danny!

1:10:21.913 --> 1:10:23.001
Danny.

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:39.817
RENEE: Oh, no, no, no.

1:11:48.608 --> 1:11:49.566
Fuck.

1:13:27.881 --> 1:13:31.668
DANNY: It's the police!
It's the police!

1:13:31.711 --> 1:13:33.365
KEVIN: Suspect spotted.
Let's go.

1:13:34.061 --> 1:13:35.672
DANNY: It's the police!

1:13:35.715 --> 1:13:37.717
KEVIN: Yeah, that's him.
He fits the description.

1:13:37.761 --> 1:13:40.111
DANNY: Hey, stop!
Stop where you are!

1:13:40.851 --> 1:13:42.374
Right now!

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:44.420
KEVIN: Stop!
ROBERTS: Hey!
Hey, turn around!

1:13:44.463 --> 1:13:46.030
PENDA: Suspect is resisting.

1:13:46.073 --> 1:13:48.032
KEVIN: Get on your knees now!
DANNY: On your knees!

1:13:48.075 --> 1:13:49.294
KEVIN: On your knees!

1:13:53.211 --> 1:13:55.735
DANNY: Fuck!
KEVIN: Wait. Everybody,
wait. Just stop.

1:13:55.779 --> 1:13:57.302
He's down.

1:13:57.345 --> 1:13:59.130
DANNY: Penda, what's the move?
PENDA: Hold it, hold it.

1:13:59.173 --> 1:14:00.436
DANNY: What's the play?
PENDA: All right, Roberts,
get in there.

1:14:00.479 --> 1:14:02.046
ROBERTS: What?
PENDA: Get in there. Move.

1:14:02.089 --> 1:14:03.787
Clear. Clear.
KEVIN:
I got you, I got you.

1:14:03.830 --> 1:14:06.529
C over.
PENDA: Ganning, stay back.

1:14:06.572 --> 1:14:08.705
Danny, follow me.
Come on, Danny.

1:14:09.967 --> 1:14:13.579
Danny, you were there.

1:14:13.623 --> 1:14:16.234
PENDA: We saw him.
We told him to stop.DANNY: Yeah.

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:23.546
DANNY: Fuck. He's a kid.

1:14:23.589 --> 1:14:24.808
PENDA: Hey, we told him
to stop.

1:14:26.505 --> 1:14:27.724
He didn't even
turn around.

1:14:37.603 --> 1:14:38.648
PENDA: What's in there?

1:14:49.572 --> 1:14:53.010
PENDA: What the fuck? Shit.

1:14:55.752 --> 1:14:57.405
He's deaf.

1:14:57.449 --> 1:14:58.885
DANNY: What?
The kid's deaf.

1:15:00.278 --> 1:15:01.584
That's why he didn't respond to us.

1:15:01.627 --> 1:15:03.063
He can't fucking hear.

1:15:03.107 --> 1:15:04.282
Oh, fuck me.

1:15:10.941 --> 1:15:11.985
Who saw this?

1:15:14.118 --> 1:15:15.511
Hey, did anyone
see this?

1:15:17.338 --> 1:15:19.645
Ganning, come here.

1:15:23.431 --> 1:15:24.476
KEVIN: Okay.

1:15:26.739 --> 1:15:27.697
PENDA: All right,
you with me?

1:15:28.828 --> 1:15:29.960
Take a look at him.

1:15:35.269 --> 1:15:36.836
DANNY: Oh, shit, his teeth.

1:15:40.231 --> 1:15:42.015
DANNY: Oh, shit.
KEVIN: Wait up, here you go.

1:15:42.059 --> 1:15:43.843
DANNY: Hey, we really
need to get him a bus.

1:15:46.498 --> 1:15:47.586
DANNY: We need to
get him a bus.

1:15:47.630 --> 1:15:48.587
PENDA:
He's not gonna make it.

1:15:55.376 --> 1:15:56.377
PENDA: Danny?

1:15:58.641 --> 1:16:00.164
Lookit, man.

1:16:00.207 --> 1:16:02.470
DANNY: Yeah?
The optics on this
look real bad.

1:16:02.514 --> 1:16:03.820
DANNY: Yeah.
You understand me?

1:16:03.863 --> 1:16:06.083
DANNY: Uh-huh.
It gets out we shot a kid,

1:16:06.126 --> 1:16:07.650
and the public,
and the administration,

1:16:07.693 --> 1:16:10.304
and everybody's gonna
ream our ass, okay?

1:16:10.348 --> 1:16:12.742
So, I'd appreciate it...
We'd appreciate it

1:16:12.785 --> 1:16:15.005
if you cooperate and
let's just keep this
between us.

1:16:15.048 --> 1:16:16.572
DANNY:
The kid's bleeding out.

1:16:16.615 --> 1:16:20.140
Look at me. Can I
trust you? Danny?

1:16:21.794 --> 1:16:23.317
You want a future, right?
DANNY: Yeah.

1:16:23.361 --> 1:16:25.450
Can I trust you?
DANNY: Yeah.

1:16:25.493 --> 1:16:26.625
Yeah, you can trust me.
PENDA: Good.

1:16:28.061 --> 1:16:29.280
We don't want
any more gunfire.

1:16:38.245 --> 1:16:39.203
DANNY: What are you doing?

1:16:43.033 --> 1:16:44.338
DANNY: What the fuck
are you doing?

1:16:52.216 --> 1:16:54.479
PENDA: Easy.

1:17:53.146 --> 1:17:54.234
Damn, Danny.

1:18:12.731 --> 1:18:15.429
CHRISTOPHER: Mom, you have
such a dangerous job.

1:18:15.473 --> 1:18:16.692
You could have picked
so many other ones,

1:18:16.735 --> 1:18:18.694
but you picked
to be a police.

1:18:18.737 --> 1:18:22.610
Why can't you be a doctor,
or a fireman or something?

1:18:22.654 --> 1:18:24.134
Daddy can't even help you.

1:18:25.352 --> 1:18:26.702
I wish I could help, though.

1:18:27.833 --> 1:18:28.878
No one can.

1:18:35.014 --> 1:18:38.191
KESPER:
This is Kesper.
Leave a message.

1:18:38.235 --> 1:18:40.846
RENEE: Sarge,
Danny Holledge is dead.

1:18:40.890 --> 1:18:42.761
He was holding evidence.

1:18:42.805 --> 1:18:46.286
I'm headed to the old plant
on 53rd and 3rd.

1:18:46.330 --> 1:18:47.723
I need to show
you what I have.

1:19:13.096 --> 1:19:14.053
Taneesha?

1:19:16.926 --> 1:19:19.755
Taneesha, I know
what happened to your son.

1:19:56.226 --> 1:19:58.097
RENEE:
Sarge, come upstairs.Renee.

1:20:02.754 --> 1:20:04.321
Hey.
Hey.

1:20:06.149 --> 1:20:08.542
What's the evidence
that you have?

1:20:08.586 --> 1:20:11.241
Body cam footage of
the night of the murder.

1:20:11.284 --> 1:20:13.765
Kind of shit that
starts riots. It's really...

1:20:21.033 --> 1:20:23.209
We need to stay unified
about what happened.

1:20:24.602 --> 1:20:25.777
Let's talk inside.

1:20:52.586 --> 1:20:55.285
Sarge, you saw
that footage, too?

1:20:55.328 --> 1:20:56.764
I don't need
to see it.

1:20:56.808 --> 1:20:58.462
I just need to
get rid of it.

1:20:58.505 --> 1:20:59.985
Letting the public
see the record

1:21:00.029 --> 1:21:03.249
would do nothing but
weaken our department.

1:21:07.166 --> 1:21:09.603
Holledge kept a copy
of that video?

1:21:09.647 --> 1:21:11.083
Where the hell is it?

1:21:11.127 --> 1:21:14.739
Danny's dead.
He died because of you.

1:21:14.782 --> 1:21:16.567
You know, I always thought
you were a cop first.

1:21:16.610 --> 1:21:18.221
I am a cop first, bitch.

1:21:27.970 --> 1:21:29.623
Give me that video, Renee.

1:21:32.888 --> 1:21:36.065
Or the next one goes
in your head
instead of your vest.

1:21:41.113 --> 1:21:42.071
KESPER: What is it?

1:21:47.903 --> 1:21:49.165
You killed my son.

1:21:51.907 --> 1:21:53.647
Who the fuck are you?

1:21:53.691 --> 1:21:55.519
DeMarco.
PENDA: What?

1:21:55.562 --> 1:21:56.650
You remember him?

1:22:00.176 --> 1:22:01.655
'Cause he remembers you.

1:22:07.357 --> 1:22:08.314
KESPER: Enough of this shit.

1:22:12.971 --> 1:22:13.929
What the fuck is that?

1:22:17.671 --> 1:22:19.151
Did you see that?

1:22:19.195 --> 1:22:21.327
Behind you.
What?

1:22:26.202 --> 1:22:28.769
Kesper. Kesper!

1:22:30.946 --> 1:22:32.948
Help me.
What the fuck?

1:22:54.012 --> 1:22:55.405
RENEE: Come on.

1:22:55.448 --> 1:22:57.885
KESPER: Please, help.

1:23:20.952 --> 1:23:23.041
You need to leave.
It's DeMarco.

1:23:23.085 --> 1:23:24.521
Can't control him.
You need to leave.

1:23:24.564 --> 1:23:25.652
No.

1:23:25.696 --> 1:23:27.089
You need to leave.

1:23:27.132 --> 1:23:28.960
No, no, no. Listen,
this ends here.

1:23:30.179 --> 1:23:31.745
Let me handle this
the right way.

1:23:50.068 --> 1:23:51.200
Stay here.

1:23:51.243 --> 1:23:52.940
Okay. Okay.

1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:02.733
PENDA: Look, Renee.
I just wanna get out of here.

1:24:37.072 --> 1:24:38.290
Fuck.

1:25:25.642 --> 1:25:26.643
Drop it, Penda.

1:25:32.649 --> 1:25:34.303
Or the next one's
in your head.

1:26:53.991 --> 1:26:56.733
Don't worry. He knows
you're with me now.

1:29:14.087 --> 1:29:17.134
NEWS ANCHOR: In the end to a stunning trial that riveted the public

1:29:17.177 --> 1:29:20.267

1:29:35.413 --> 1:29:38.590
revealing involvement of fellow officers Kevin Ganning,

1:29:38.634 --> 1:29:41.245
Gabe Roberts and Dario Penda.

1:29:41.288 --> 1:29:43.029
In brief comments
after the trial,

1:29:43.073 --> 1:29:46.598
