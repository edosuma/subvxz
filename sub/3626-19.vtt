Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:03.960 --> 00:05.527
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.614 --> 00:06.919
Yale has rescinded
your acceptance

00:07.007 --> 00:08.486
and given the spot to nelly.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.836
Doesn't hurt nearly as bad
as waking up that morning

00:10.923 --> 00:12.925
in Santorini and finding
you jumped on a boat.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.624
That night wasn't exactly
what I signed up for either.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.321
When your father escaped
to Dominica, he could only get

00:17.408 --> 00:19.019
his hands on enough money
to get himself set up.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.021
- We-we don't have any money.
- The Van Der Bilts do.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.153
But why would my grandparents
pay us to go live with him

00:23.240 --> 00:24.415
when they can't even
help us out here?

00:24.502 --> 00:26.461
Isn't it just breathtaking?

00:26.548 --> 00:28.071
[Serena]
'Mom, your art consultant
has exquisite taste.'

00:28.158 --> 00:29.507
You've got a good heart.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.900
'You should give it
to somebody who cares.'

00:30.987 --> 00:33.337
- Miss Blair is out, Mr. Chuck.
- I'll wait.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.600
Carter, what are you doing here?

00:35.687 --> 00:36.775
Buying you a drink.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.651
And who am I?

00:42.738 --> 00:44.609
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.786
You know you love me.

00:47.873 --> 00:51.268
XOXO, Gossip Girl.

00:51.355 --> 00:52.748
[instrumental music]

00:52.835 --> 00:55.229
Springtime on
the Upper East Side

00:55.316 --> 00:59.059
where the winter chill is
supposed to be so last season.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.931
But when mittens and scarves
are still all the rage

01:02.018 --> 01:04.064
the best thing you can do
is just button up

01:04.151 --> 01:06.675
and hope for warmer days.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.590
Budapest, Bucharest,
Dubrovnik..

01:08.677 --> 01:11.245
Oh, there's nothing like summer
in the eastern bloc.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.985
Just a Eurail pass
and a backpack

01:13.073 --> 01:15.031
full of failed
socialist policies.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.467
[laughs]

01:16.554 --> 01:19.122
And Nate, the Vienna State Opera
one day

01:19.209 --> 01:20.471
'pierogies in Poland the next.'

01:20.558 --> 01:22.430
No map, no reservations,
just total freedom

01:22.517 --> 01:23.996
and Nate is
super excited too.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.563
'Probably not as excited
as he is about'

01:25.650 --> 01:27.522

[Trip]
I know your mom's out of town,
but if you came--

01:29.393 --> 01:31.743
Hey, guys.
Hey, this is my cousin Trip.

01:31.830 --> 01:32.962
- Hi
- This is my girlfriend Vanessa.

01:33.049 --> 01:34.572
- Hi.
- 'This is Dan.'

01:34.659 --> 01:36.008
- Hi. Dan. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.575
I'm trying to convince
Nate here to make

01:37.662 --> 01:39.708
an appearance at the family
hoodoo this weekend.

01:39.795 --> 01:42.493
Lunch today,
cocktail party tomorrow.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.234
Hey, Maureen will be there.

01:44.321 --> 01:45.975
- We're engaged now.
- I didn't know that.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.282
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, well, you missed a lot.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.674
[instrumental music]

01:49.761 --> 01:52.547
Ah, hey, why don't you drop by?

01:52.634 --> 01:55.115
Grandfather would love
to see you too.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.942
[sighs]

01:57.029 --> 01:59.162
I know, I..
Look, I appreciate it, Trip.

01:59.249 --> 02:01.773
I do. There's just
a lot of stuff going on.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.253
Okay, I can take a hint.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.341
Call me if you change
your mind, alright?

02:04.428 --> 02:06.343
I will. I will.
Congratulations.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.128
Thanks, man.
It was nice meeting you.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.781
- Bye.
- Nice to meeting you, Trip.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.916
You-you're gonna skip out
on your family reunion?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.526
I appreciate the commitment
to the game--

02:15.613 --> 02:17.615
No, listen, man, I'm not
gonna go pretend to bond

02:17.702 --> 02:19.226
with the people who
shut me and my mom out

02:19.313 --> 02:21.271
when my dad got busted.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.794
Let's go inside.
The game's starting.

[cell phone vibrates]

02:24.840 --> 02:27.451
Hello, sweetheart.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.236
Chuck, I have been looking
for my phone all morning.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.412
I was checking to see
if Blair changed her number.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.153
Well, if she's not
calling you back

02:33.240 --> 02:34.719
you should probably
take the hint.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.113
I went to see her last week.
She never came home.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.028
It's not like our girl
to be out all night.

02:39.115 --> 02:40.943
I know something's
going on.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.684
This is more than her having
her dirty laundry

02:42.771 --> 02:43.859
aired on "Gossip Girl."

02:47.341 --> 02:48.429
She, um..

02:50.257 --> 02:51.388
She got rejected by Yale.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.045
The only thing she wanted
more than me.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.613
That would be painful.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.484
Chuck, she's embarrassed,
so we just need

03:00.571 --> 03:02.094
to give her some time
to lick her wounds.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.532
Maybe I can lick them for her.

03:04.619 --> 03:05.576
Ugh.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.840
[music continues]

03:13.149 --> 03:16.587

Blair, hey, it's me.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.589
Now here's an extraordinary
new piece

03:18.676 --> 03:20.504
I can get from
a private collector--

03:20.591 --> 03:22.245
'I thought perhaps
for the bedroom.'

03:22.332 --> 03:25.683
Oh, I agree. It's perfect.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.512

03:32.299 --> 03:33.691
Oh, I wish I could talk,
my darling,

03:33.778 --> 03:35.084
but I'm right in the middle
of something.

Okay. Bye.

03:40.524 --> 03:43.832

want to thank you

03:43.919 --> 03:45.616

so gracefully.

The whole Rufus thing.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.884

used to date" thing?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.541
Oh, God.

03:57.628 --> 03:58.977
Please tell me
that I'm not putting

03:59.064 --> 04:02.372
an enormous foot
in my mouth.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.809
- He told you, right?
- Well, of course he did.

04:05.636 --> 04:06.724
It's fine.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.773
So you were thinking
above the bed?

04:11.860 --> 04:14.515
I think it'll
look fantastic there.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.821
I figured out
the split screen.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.607
Alright. Now we can watch
all four games at once.

indistinctly on TV]

04:24.829 --> 04:27.354

talking about?

Are you sure you don't wanna
go to your family reunion?

04:29.573 --> 04:31.836
We know they weren't cool to you
and your mom, but, I mean

04:31.923 --> 04:33.534
it seems like your cousin
is trying to make up for it.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.492
Yeah, well, unless he's armed
with an engraved apology

04:35.579 --> 04:37.364
from my grandfather,
I do not care.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.453
Nate, they're making an effort.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.845
Yeah, sure they're making
an effort now.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.892
But where were they
when we needed them?

04:43.979 --> 04:45.676
You've told me about your
summers with your cousins

04:45.763 --> 04:47.896
about your grandfather
teaching you to sail

04:47.983 --> 04:49.985
how much you used to look
forward to Christmas.

really don't wanna go, fine.'

a few times.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.258
You might have
mentioned that

05:02.345 --> 05:03.912
considering
that she works for me.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.741
It was humiliating.

Well, I've been meaning
to tell you.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.746
You know, it's a shame
we never see each other.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.182
Are there any other exes

05:13.269 --> 05:14.966
I should know about
my trainer, my accountant--

05:15.053 --> 05:16.707
I'm sorry. But it's not
like I ever asked you

05:16.794 --> 05:18.056
to make a list of everyone
you've dated.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.536
Yes, well, I'd be happy
to make one.

05:19.623 --> 05:21.451
- Sure.
- Do you think I wouldn't?

05:21.538 --> 05:23.018
I don't think about it.
I think we should just drop it.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.412
- Let's make lists.
- Lily.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.544
Look, you clearly have
some idea about my past

05:27.631 --> 05:29.416
that I'd prefer to dispel,
and this way I won't be

of course, there's something

this was his idea.
