In a twist, a Florida man
broke into the Orange County Jail today.

00:36.161 --> 00:39.914
The suspect, out on bail
on charges of robbing a jewelry store,

00:39.914 --> 00:43.043
<i>wanted to retrieve his cell phone
from the effects locker</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:46.171

00:48.381 --> 00:49.632
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

00:49.632 --> 00:51.009
- Shit.
- Run!

00:53.303 --> 00:54.554
Shit, shit, shit.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.933
Get the hell back here!

00:58.933 --> 01:01.102
Get back there, now!

How you gals doing here?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.380
Pretty good, thanks.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.014
Yeah? Okay.

01:38.848 --> 01:39.891
Where's Sonny?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.815
You must be the girl who wasn't murdered.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.108
Not yet anyway.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.236
What are you drinking?

01:52.570 --> 01:53.780
What will this get me?

01:55.698 --> 01:57.951
That will probably get you
most of that top shelf

01:57.951 --> 01:59.536
and this entire building.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.038
There's more.

02:03.164 --> 02:03.998
Where?

02:04.666 --> 02:05.708
I don't know.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.418
Might be where you come in.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.755
Your son said
you're a man of many talents.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.967
Mike said that about me?

02:13.967 --> 02:15.301
I'm paraphrasing.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.139
He doesn't know you're here.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.725
He doesn't think it's true.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.104
I'm guessing, uh...

02:28.439 --> 02:29.399
bourbon.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.318
See? Already solving mysteries.

02:36.906 --> 02:40.076
So Mike said I was good
at finding things, huh?

02:41.870 --> 02:42.704
Yeah.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.957
- Mike said "acquiring."
- This acquisition...

02:47.500 --> 02:49.836
- how many figures we talking?
- Nine.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.466
But to be honest,
eight of those are zeros.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.429
One second.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.272
- Hey.
<i>I know where the truck is.</i>

03:12.025 --> 03:13.401
That is very good news.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.319
<i>I agree.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:15.862
<i>Where are you?</i>

03:16.404 --> 03:18.573
Uh, I got hungry.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.574
I'll come back.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.242
We'll celebrate.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.081
Pfft.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.876
Fuck. This is awkward.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.670
Mike.

03:33.671 --> 03:34.505
Yeah.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.215
Seems he found it.

03:37.675 --> 03:39.052
- So...
- Ah.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.060
Well... in case you two need any help...

03:51.022 --> 03:53.233
now we know where to find each other.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.779
To Moss.

03:58.279 --> 04:02.075
May he fuck-- and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart--off.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.956
- So how heavy is the gold?
- Very.

04:08.539 --> 04:09.916
And how far down is the truck?

04:10.416 --> 04:14.420
Well, the sinkhole
is no more than 70 feet deep.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.007
I'll rent some scuba gear
and tomorrow night we can see.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.050
Uh-huh.

04:19.717 --> 04:22.470
Right, but where I was going in this,

04:22.470 --> 04:25.765
- I don't dive. I don't lift things.
- Mm-hm.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.686
I'm sorry if that wasn't
on my LinkedIn profile. We need help.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.438
Yeah, but I'm not sure
who I'd want to involve, so...

04:32.438 --> 04:33.481
I don't know.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.732
- Family?
- No.

04:34.732 --> 04:37.151
Patsy's checking
on your ambulance driver's chances

04:37.151 --> 04:39.195
to see if he's good for your murder,
so no.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.074
- Who, Dad?
- No.

04:43.074 --> 04:43.992
No?

04:43.992 --> 04:45.660
Sorry. I meant, fuck no.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.163
Right. You said you guys
don't get along so well,

04:49.163 --> 04:52.292
- but I figured for, like, $100 million--
- Fuck no. He's a criminal.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.210
- We're criminals.
- We're not criminals.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.838
- We're being criminals.
- We're not doing anything wrong.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.800
Sometimes you do certain things
and it doesn't mean you are that thing.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.594
- Oh, my God. You're hearing this, right?
- It's simple.

05:03.594 --> 05:06.764
If he finds out about the gold,
he'll take it. Okay?

05:10.101 --> 05:10.935
Fine.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.479
Fuck no, it is.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.442
Forty bucks.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.360
Forty bucks.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.278
Rich man.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.364
Oh, God.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.578
Okay,
but there must be something we can do.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.165
I'm afraid
we've done all we can medically.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.835
As far as any end-of-life wishes
like organ donation,

05:35.835 --> 05:38.755
someone from here
will come by to discuss that with you.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.590
I'm so sorry.

06:06.699 --> 06:07.909
Where are you going?

06:07.909 --> 06:10.787
I wanna know how long we have
to get that truck out of there.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.498
So I changed my mind about asking family.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.791
Your dad?

06:15.458 --> 06:17.043
Nope, my brother-in-law.

06:18.336 --> 06:22.090
He does survey work at the sinkhole.
I think he'll be good for information.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.508
He loves to talk.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.720
Who's that?

06:27.720 --> 06:29.597
- Moss.
- No. No. Okay, wait--

06:29.597 --> 06:31.933
No, no, don't stop me, I wanna hear.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.814
Moss. Let me call you back.
I may have a line on Delly's killer.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.441
<i>Shut up, shut up.
Let me ask you something.</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:42.151
When you discovered her...

06:43.861 --> 06:45.655
was there anything on her?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.407
Well, just a sheet.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.411
- But I couldn't see anything--
- In her possession. Jesus.

06:52.912 --> 06:56.165
<i>When she left,
she took some cash from my safe</i>

06:56.165 --> 06:59.460
and a little computer thingy.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.338
Whoo! Yes!

07:04.257 --> 07:06.175
You gave her your safe combination?

07:06.175 --> 07:07.343
<i>Fuck you.</i>

07:07.343 --> 07:09.053
It's M-O-S-S, isn't it?

07:09.846 --> 07:10.763
<i>Did she or not?</i>

07:11.472 --> 07:13.599
Just some keys and her phone.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.226
<i>Just go check again.</i>

07:15.226 --> 07:17.103
Personal effects, whatever.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.479
And call me back.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.274
But... not until after 2:00.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.318
I'm trying samples from the caterers.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.112
What caterers?

07:26.654 --> 07:30.867
<i>For the memorial I'm having tomorrow
because my girlfriend was murdered,</i>

07:30.867 --> 07:34.328
<i>which makes me sad
because I sent some dickless prick</i>

07:34.328 --> 07:37.623
<i>to find her killer
and he hasn't done shit,</i>

07:37.623 --> 07:39.667
which makes me mad.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.008
What computer thingy?

07:51.095 --> 07:51.929
No idea.

07:54.432 --> 07:55.266
Okay.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.977
I'll be back. Stay here.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.579
Shit.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.666
Hi, Dave. You didn't get back to me.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.001
You're one coffee up on me.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.045
Can this wait
until after the staff meeting?

08:24.045 --> 08:27.298
Oh, it's herbal tea.
I don't drink caffeine because it's aging.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.635
As I said in my e-mail you ignored,
I am doing that fast in this job.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.346
By the time he was my age, Jesus was dead.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.557
That's still better than Orlando.
So if I'm gonna make it out of here,

08:36.557 --> 08:38.684
you need
to let me do investigative journalism

08:38.684 --> 08:41.145
like I was trained for
at the University of Georgia.

08:41.145 --> 08:42.271
Trained?

08:42.271 --> 08:44.273
It's a real program. Shut up.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.151
Okay. Here's my reply.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.821
"Dear Kaitlin, thank you for your e-mail.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.741
Unfortunately,
you are not an investigative journalist

08:53.741 --> 08:56.452
until you fucking investigate something.

08:56.452 --> 08:59.914
Until then, read what rolls
on the goddamn teleprompter.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.123
LOL."

09:01.123 --> 09:02.041
Send.

09:05.127 --> 09:05.962
Asshole.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.302
<i>Hi, this is Mike. Leave a message.</i>

09:15.263 --> 09:17.848
Hey, Mike, Kaitlin Fox.

09:17.848 --> 09:18.766
Again.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.164
Oh, yeah.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.293
- Oh, yeah.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.225
Seriously? You're still following me?

10:01.225 --> 10:05.438
Following you? No. We just happen
to be headed to the same place.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.606
Except we're not.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.281
Oh, very fucking funny.
- Be careful getting out.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.868
You used to be smart.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.954
I know because I signed your report cards.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.999
But this thing you're gonna do?
You'll fuck it up.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.460
So, I tell you what I'll do,
I'll run this operation.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.503
I'm gonna cut you in at 10%.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.590
You're gonna cut me in for 10%?

10:32.590 --> 10:34.133
The number's negotiable.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.302
Tip from an ex-gambler,

10:36.302 --> 10:38.888
don't bluff if you don't know
what you're holding, okay?

10:38.888 --> 10:42.224
Well, I know whatever it is was enough
for that girl to fake her own death.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.478
Andy saw her.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.188
At your motel.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.732
Nice obituary.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.195
It's ironic how somebody's obituary
can get them killed.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.953
If you think I'm bluffing...

11:04.080 --> 11:06.666
you're an even shittier gambler
than I thought.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.171
- No.
- No?

11:12.171 --> 11:15.424
You don't have anything.
You're a lot, but you're not a murderer.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.303
Thanks. Should save that
for a Father's Day card.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.640
- Did you get my e-mail?

11:23.307 --> 11:26.394
There's more on the drive of Moss,
his sister, and--

11:27.061 --> 11:28.270
No, Mike's not here.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.566
By tomorrow, I hope.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.152
If everything goes okay,
I'll see you soon.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.739
Yeah, I love you too.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.757
I assume you saw this.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.262
Thought you should know
Moss Yankov's alibi is dead.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.432
- Memorial's tomorrow.
- Mm-hm. Moss' house.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.642
I'm thinking, in lieu of flowers,

12:06.642 --> 12:09.895
we send someone
from the Organized Crime Task Force.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.896
- Good idea.
- Mm-hm.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.442
But not you,
because you're not on the case anymore.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.154
- Thank you, though.
- Yep.

12:21.615 --> 12:24.285
What's the plan with all of this?
Do you know?

12:24.285 --> 12:28.080
Oh, I know. The other night,
you said you had no idea what I do.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.875
- Well, I think I do now.
- I'm a futurist.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.210
- I-- No. I was wrong.
- Look out there.

12:33.752 --> 12:37.089
Most people see a muddy hole in the ground
filled with busted up concrete

12:37.089 --> 12:39.175
and a lumberjack head.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.135
Surveyors see the future.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.054
I look out there, I see,
in no time at all, a beautiful lake.

12:44.054 --> 12:47.516
When you say, "In no time at all,"
how much time is that?

12:47.516 --> 12:49.268
We'll get going in four days

12:49.268 --> 12:51.896
when they shoot gunite into the hole
to seal it up.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.774
Four days? And what about
this stuff still in the water?

12:55.774 --> 12:59.778
Anything still down there will get
sealed up in two feet of concrete.

12:59.778 --> 13:03.115
You got any bodies that need burying,
now's your chance.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.533
I'll let you know.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.119
Well, it's not like anyone would stop me.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.206
I walked right in here.
There's not much security.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.333
Well, county paid for the fences,

13:12.333 --> 13:15.878
and that church there pays for a guard
to circle the place at night,

13:16.587 --> 13:18.923
but, I mean, you can only do so much.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.760
Tell me about your fancy toilet.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.470
What?

13:25.095 --> 13:27.181
Remember that guy who over-ordered?

13:28.265 --> 13:31.685
Steve Hubley, the foreman.
That's his trailer over there.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.812
- But he's at "lunch" right now.
- Mm.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.525
I don't know why I said lunch like that.
He really is at lunch.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.819
- And what if I wanted one?
- Why? Are you moving here?

13:40.819 --> 13:43.405
That is so exciting!
You play softball? I'm in a league.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.158
It's for Sonny. A surprise.
Don't say anything.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.578
Okay. You know, I got excited.
For-- For Patsy, you know?

13:50.162 --> 13:51.080
She misses you.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.582
I just can't be here, in Florida, Deacon.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.044
How about dinner,
you and Sonny tomorrow night? For Patsy.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.382
Not tomorrow,
but I can come the night after.

14:02.716 --> 14:03.926
But you knew that, right?

14:04.718 --> 14:07.555
- As a futurist, I know your every move.
- Oh. Let's hope not.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.406
Steve? Deacon said I would be stopping by.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.950
- About the toilet?
- Oh.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.704
Hell of an upgrade.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.833
- Um, Mike, was it?
- Yeah. Yeah. Mike.

14:35.833 --> 14:39.753
Yeah. I'm not sure I can get you the same,
but give me a few days.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.174
I don't need a toilet.

14:47.219 --> 14:53.475
What I need is somebody who can work
an hour of unauthorized overtime,

14:54.351 --> 14:55.769
and who can run a crane.

14:56.478 --> 14:59.189
Maybe for a fee,
you can point me in the right direction.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.359
You don't think I can run a crane?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.279
Not what I said.

15:05.779 --> 15:06.614
Can you?

15:08.073 --> 15:10.659
One hour. For say, 500 bucks?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.916
By which I mean 700.

15:21.712 --> 15:22.546
A thousand.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.849
I had a question
on what I should say,

15:34.642 --> 15:38.103
in regards to when people ask me about
the events surrounding Delly's demise?

15:38.103 --> 15:39.772
You say the truth.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.859
Which is, I gave her a new BMW
which she took on vacation to Florida,

15:43.859 --> 15:47.404
where she became one of the millions
tragically murdered there every year.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.323
Gotcha. Gotcha. Got it. Got it.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.327
Last time you were in my office,
did you see that...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.288
That computer thingy?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.707
You always keep it in your safe.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.209
Well, it's not in the fucking safe,

16:00.209 --> 16:03.170
which might be a clue
as to why I'm asking if you've seen it.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.422
What's on it?

16:10.260 --> 16:13.806
Uh, just-- Just, you know, business stuff.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.600
You know, records of... everything.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.561
Oh, okay.
I'll tell you what, I'll look for it.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.271
- All right, good.
- Hey. Hey.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.565
Did my sister get back to you?

16:24.149 --> 16:27.361
She said she'll try to make it,
but she has meetings with the governor.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.613
- I bet she will.
- She could just say "meetings."

16:29.613 --> 16:31.657
She doesn't have to say
"with the governor."

16:31.657 --> 16:36.078
Hey, when she does,
don't mention the computer thingy.

16:36.078 --> 16:39.331
- Okay, you got it.
- Yeah, and move my table!

16:39.331 --> 16:43.043
The table, got it. You got it.
Moving it right now, all right.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.630
I meant to tell you
to rest in peace.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.133
Thanks. I was so young.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.302
It is weird, I'm just gone.

16:52.302 --> 16:56.849
On the other hand, all the stupid shit
I did in my life till now? Also gone.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.100
That was somebody else.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.979
- Don't worry. You'll do new stupid shit.
- Aw. Thanks.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.441
Son of a bitch.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.407
Unbelievable.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.041
Fuck.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.334
Who is it?

17:25.836 --> 17:29.381
The one in the middle's my dad.
Those two flying monkeys are ex-cops.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.633
My dad saw your obituary,

17:31.633 --> 17:34.344
and said if I cut him in,
he wouldn't rat you out to Moss.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.139
Oh, okay, so you brought him in?

17:37.848 --> 17:40.100
Fuck no. I told him no.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.270
What-- ? Mike, you did what now? Fuck.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.022
Fuck.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.985
I didn't tell you about this place.
So which one of you followed me?

17:49.985 --> 17:52.571
What matters is we're here to join forces.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.241
Delly, my dad, Sonny.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.244
Ray-Ray, Buzz. This is Delly.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.207
Nice to meet you.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.794
Okay, so that we're clear
right from the start,

18:06.794 --> 18:09.338
I'm running this show. Okay?
This is not a partnership.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.839
You're running the show?

18:12.257 --> 18:15.260
- Well, I don't mean it like that.
- Oh, so the split?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.679
Five people, five ways.

18:17.679 --> 18:20.974
Nuh-uh, I came down here for all of it.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.560
- Now I get, what, 20 percent? No.
- Yeah.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.563
These guys are on your payroll.
I don't need them.

18:27.481 --> 18:32.319
No, son. I don't think now is the time
to figure out who is or is not expendable.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.490
What are we looking at
in terms of legal exposure?

18:37.116 --> 18:40.577
Minimal. Trespassing,
series of misdemeanors.

18:40.577 --> 18:44.373
The State of Florida's claim
on gold or treasure found in it

18:44.373 --> 18:46.083
hasn't held up in court so far.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.253
So we're not even stealing from them.

18:50.546 --> 18:53.924
This is all assuming
the truck is even down there.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.342
It'll be there.

18:55.342 --> 18:56.844
"It'll be there."

18:57.469 --> 18:58.303
It's there.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.430
You've seen it?

19:03.642 --> 19:06.395
I made a reasonable deduction
that it's there.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.438
So you deduced that
with your big detective brain?

19:08.438 --> 19:11.066
I brought scuba gear to find out.
All we need to do is--

19:16.488 --> 19:18.532
Whoo!

19:30.544 --> 19:32.629
So... the split.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.674
I don't think it's fair for us to decide.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.427
We should listen
to what the lady suggests.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.432
Here's what the lady suggests.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.351
You two play out your personal shit
on your own time,

19:46.351 --> 19:49.688
and now we make a plan
about how and when we do this.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.441
The split is half to Mike and me...

19:53.567 --> 19:55.527
and you three can figure out
how to be happy

19:55.527 --> 19:58.906
with $50 million between you that
you didn't have when you woke up today.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.910
What we're all gonna do is stop with
the sideways-ass, "aw, shucks" threats,

20:02.910 --> 20:06.538
because every one of us
can fuck things up for everyone else.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.123
Okay?

20:13.545 --> 20:17.466
Woo-hoo!
There's a brand-new Porsche down there

20:17.466 --> 20:20.427
with not a scratch on it, and I call dibs.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.471
What about the truck?

20:22.471 --> 20:24.014
Oh, yeah.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.016
It's next to a big yellow truck.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.744
What?

20:47.996 --> 20:48.830
What?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.457
How did Buzz know there was gold?

20:53.335 --> 20:54.336
What do you mean?

20:55.170 --> 20:59.758
Well, he mentioned the State of Florida
pursuing claims of gold.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.428
I never told my dad
there was any gold. So...

21:05.973 --> 21:08.267
Fine. What was I supposed to do?

21:09.268 --> 21:11.228
How much clearer could I be
than "fuck no"?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.980
I had already talked to him.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.899
- Gone behind my back, you mean.
- I didn't go behind your back.

21:15.899 --> 21:19.069
Hard as it is to imagine,
my actions were unrelated to you.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.946
He is literally related to me.

21:20.946 --> 21:25.367
You said he steals things.
So I went to someone who can steal things.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.285
From us.

21:27.244 --> 21:31.581
You were out! I had to figure out
how not to get murdered by Moss.

21:31.581 --> 21:35.210
Now, thanks to you, I have to cut
my fucking father in on my gold.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.505
Your gold? You wouldn't even know
there was gold if it wasn't for me.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.466
No. You wouldn't even know
there was gold if it wasn't for me.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.343
- What?
- I told Gil Franco.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.679
In confidence, in a meeting.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.597
Fuck him. I'm glad he's dead.

21:47.597 --> 21:51.101
And then he told Moss
and now you're here. So me, me, mine!

21:53.061 --> 21:54.062
That's it!

21:54.646 --> 21:56.815
- Where are you going?
- I'm not riding with you!

21:56.815 --> 22:00.861
What are you gonna tell your Uber driver?
"Pick me up where the gold is"?

22:00.861 --> 22:04.489
If you told a room of gambling addicts
about the world's biggest score,

22:04.489 --> 22:06.033
that's your fuck-up!

22:06.033 --> 22:11.038
It was not my first choice to get stuck
in your father-son fucking psychodrama!

22:11.038 --> 22:14.082
My hope is you take some of that money
and you get some therapy,

22:14.082 --> 22:16.793
because I trust him more than I trust you.

22:16.793 --> 22:20.589
- He's honest about being a criminal.
- I am not a criminal!

22:20.589 --> 22:22.716
- Oh...
- I am doing this just to get out!

22:22.716 --> 22:23.884
Just to get clear.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.928
Fuck! I don't care!

22:26.928 --> 22:28.180
Jesus.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.932
Just drive!

22:38.065 --> 22:40.233
I figure we dive in two teams of two.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.194
Take a couple, two, three nights.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.363
No. One night. Tomorrow.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.950
I'm not staying here
a minute longer than I have to.

22:50.077 --> 22:54.498
There's a crane sitting on site.
I paid Deacon's toilet buddy to run it.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.375
Slap a chain around the truck axle,
yank it out like a marlin,

22:57.375 --> 22:58.835
45 minutes, we're out.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.005
- You involved Deacon?
- No, I didn't say that.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.966
I said I involved a crane operator.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.845
For a guy who likes to work alone,
you talk to a lot of people.

23:08.845 --> 23:12.307
- How much does the crane guy know?
- Doesn't know anything.

23:12.307 --> 23:14.267
Very good. So he's like you.

23:14.267 --> 23:18.021
I'm not the bad guy.
He's the one who was gonna get you killed.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.398
You're acting like
this is some kind of movie heist

23:20.398 --> 23:23.610
and you're gonna use your special skills
to pull off one last score.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.695
You don't have any special skills.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.033
You don't leave things to chance.
When we pull that truck out of the water,

23:30.033 --> 23:32.911
how are we gonna get it somewhere
to remove the goods?

23:32.911 --> 23:36.873
- I can borrow my cousin's tow truck.
- Great. What about security?

23:36.873 --> 23:40.043
Buzz is there
staking out the church guard situation.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.795
You realize what he's doing.

23:43.547 --> 23:47.134
<i>♪ She's a chick with a wet... ♪</i>

23:49.302 --> 23:52.389
Okay, we need to know how long the guard's
inside the church in-between circuits

23:52.389 --> 23:53.390
<i>and that's our window.</i>

23:54.015 --> 23:59.688
Well, if it's a long window, we can take
care of the guy until we get the job done.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.483
Well, anyone good at lying and deception?

24:06.862 --> 24:07.988
- Anyone?
- Fuck.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.783
I might join Buzz
and get eyes on the situation myself,

24:11.783 --> 24:15.704
because I prefer it to the company here.
You, let's go for a ride.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.836
She's, uh...

24:23.712 --> 24:25.881
She is a real firecracker.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.968
A man could get his fingers blown off.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.021
Hurry up! My teeth are floating!

24:41.021 --> 24:43.732
I said a minute, Buzz. God.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.235
What will you do with your share?

24:48.361 --> 24:49.196
Leave.

24:50.822 --> 24:51.990
You should go to Vegas.

24:52.616 --> 24:53.450
Swear to God,

24:53.450 --> 24:56.411
the most beautiful city in the world,
bar none.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.538
Yeah, you been?
- Me? No.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.999
Buzz, don't make me
come out there, now.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.542
I'm buying new boots.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.920
Alligator.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.129
And an airboat.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.256
To hunt pythons with.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.925
Ow. Son of a bitch!

25:09.925 --> 25:11.009
- Oh!
- Score!

25:11.676 --> 25:14.054
Buzz, goddamn it.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.980
He's almost back to the church.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.275
The intervals are too short.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.823
We gotta find a way
to keep him inside for 45 minutes.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.450
"We"?

25:37.786 --> 25:38.828
Probably you.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.622
Yeah.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.294
Uh, what the fuck is up with Buzz?

25:47.754 --> 25:49.839
It happened when Sonny was chief.

25:50.423 --> 25:53.551
We were on a night raid,
a no-knock situation.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.846
<i>Buzz was supposed to
cut the power to the house,</i>

25:56.846 --> 26:00.433
but with all the illegal wiring,
he grabbed a bare 220 line.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.730
He kind of got rebooted.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.360
His ability to concentrate is attenuated.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.698
But Sonny kept him on,
so he got his pension.

26:15.740 --> 26:19.452
Didn't get to carry a sidearm afterwards,
which was a good call.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.539
His wife left him.

26:22.539 --> 26:23.540
Hmm.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.084
But statistically,
cop marriages don't last anyway.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.419
Mm-hm.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.005
Even with this group,
there's Buzz, Mike...

26:30.755 --> 26:31.673
Mike?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.717
And with Iris also being a cop...

26:34.843 --> 26:36.678
I guess Mike counts as two.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.360
Seriously?

26:53.445 --> 26:56.281
- What the hell?
Why don't you ask your cop wife?

27:17.469 --> 27:21.014
<i>♪ She used to be my girl ♪</i>

27:21.014 --> 27:24.601
<i>♪ She had a charming personality... ♪</i>

27:26.269 --> 27:29.272
Is it weird to cut it?
I mean, if she was stabbed?

27:30.231 --> 27:32.442
I think she was shot, so it's fine.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.159
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

27:41.701 --> 27:44.954
<i>How do you know the departed?</i>
<i>High school friends.</i>

27:44.954 --> 27:46.706
<i>Oh. Locally?</i>

27:46.706 --> 27:48.583
<i>No, Chicago.</i>

27:49.793 --> 27:53.922
I didn't even know she was in Philly
until I saw it in the... you know.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.467
I'm not even sure why I came.

27:58.009 --> 28:01.805
Maybe it's because she's the first person
I know my age who died.

28:02.305 --> 28:03.598
Oh, yeah.

28:04.849 --> 28:05.934
Been there before.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.353
A few times.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.731
Jimmy, associate of the bereaved.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.274
Leah. Yeah.

28:14.484 --> 28:17.946
So how did it happen?
I mean, the newspaper didn't say.

28:17.946 --> 28:21.741
Oh, her boyfriend Moss gave her a new car,

28:22.575 --> 28:24.494
which she drove down to Florida,

28:24.494 --> 28:28.456
only to become one of the many BMW drivers
tragically murdered there every year.

28:28.456 --> 28:30.041
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.835
And Moss, is he okay?

28:34.087 --> 28:38.383
He blames himself mostly, you know?
Because he gave her the car, one.

28:38.383 --> 28:42.303
He also thinks if he had just sent Mike
a day earlier after her...

28:43.054 --> 28:46.015
That kind of thinking,
it just leads to madness.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.560
- Mike?
- The one who found her.

28:49.978 --> 28:53.356
We had people at the memorial.
You were told not to go.

28:53.356 --> 28:55.275
Yes, you had people outside the memorial

28:55.275 --> 28:59.446
because the people inside know
every cop on the task force, except me.

29:00.029 --> 29:02.741
So was this stunt worth risking your job?

29:03.450 --> 29:04.451
Not sure yet.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.662
But now we know
that Moss' girlfriend went to Florida,

29:07.662 --> 29:11.458
she was killed in Florida, and we already
knew Gil Franco had a boat in Florida.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.626
And was Mike at the memorial?

29:13.626 --> 29:15.336
Of course not. Mike is in--

29:16.171 --> 29:17.005
Where?

29:19.174 --> 29:20.008
Florida.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.385
Iris...
- I know.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.429
That's why I need to go there.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.638
I'm sorry, what?

29:25.638 --> 29:27.766
Hear me out. I know his family.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.184
They'll talk to me.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.352
If Mike is involved at all,
I'll know about it.

29:31.352 --> 29:32.771
Then you'll do what?

29:32.771 --> 29:34.397
- Arrest him?
- Yes!

29:35.064 --> 29:37.400
If you had a chance to arrest your ex,
wouldn't you?

29:37.400 --> 29:38.693
- I did.
- You did?

29:39.861 --> 29:42.572
Twice. Not the same guy, two times.
Two guys, once.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.657
And both times, it was hard.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.368
Ma'am, I know what people here think.

29:48.203 --> 29:52.040
"What kind of detective wouldn't know
her own husband is crooked?"

29:52.832 --> 29:56.586
That doesn't make me a bad cop.
It makes him a shitty husband.

29:58.296 --> 30:00.381
And I don't have a husband anymore.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.842
Let this go, Iris.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.596
The worst choice you can make
is a bad choice twice.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.266
Somebody gave me that
printed on a rock once.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.018
It's in the evidence locker now.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.513
Nice you could make it.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.476
I'm so sorry.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.315
You should have come. Everyone was here.

30:59.315 --> 31:02.777
- Exactly why I couldn't come.
- Yeah, optics. I know.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.863
You taught me that word.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.156
Yeah, so you understand
why the governor's office

31:07.156 --> 31:10.618
can't exactly be represented
at a party full of criminals?

31:10.618 --> 31:11.870
Memorial.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.164
And the governor's office
<i>is</i> a party full of criminals.

31:15.164 --> 31:18.793
Which I'm working my ass off
to get us invited to. So...

31:18.793 --> 31:20.920
I'm working here too, Dori.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.549
I'm doing the work we do
that Dad put me in charge of.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.217
Your thing is not better than my thing.

31:26.217 --> 31:30.263
My thing is the same as yours
except on an infinitely larger scale,

31:30.263 --> 31:32.223
if you don't fuck it up for us.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.725
And how would I do that?

31:34.392 --> 31:37.145
- Did you know the cops were here today?
- Yes.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.606
I saw them sitting in their shitbox car.

31:39.606 --> 31:42.150
I'm talking about the one
you invited into the house.

31:43.109 --> 31:46.529
From the task force
that's literally investigating you now.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.410
So what? I hope he liked the cake.
That's all he would've gotten.

31:52.410 --> 31:56.372
She. And Dad would have
never let her past the front door.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.962
I really am sorry about Delly.

32:05.048 --> 32:05.882
I liked her.

32:07.425 --> 32:08.593
I should go.

32:09.093 --> 32:13.056
Gotta drive back to Harrisburg so I can
make some calls with the governor.

32:14.474 --> 32:15.683
Sorry for your loss.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.026
He was the gambler, the liar.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.736
Did I punish him for that? No.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.113
Now my very first case,
he gets me kicked off?

32:29.113 --> 32:32.617
I'm in the same exact place I was,
still dragging him along everywhere I go.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.122
Why...

32:39.540 --> 32:40.416
Do...

32:41.501 --> 32:42.794
You...

32:43.878 --> 32:44.921
Still...

32:45.380 --> 32:47.632
- Care about him?
- Care? No, I don't-- I'm talking about me.

32:47.632 --> 32:48.716
I don't care about Mike.

32:50.551 --> 32:51.970
- Liar.
- Shut up. Fine.

32:51.970 --> 32:56.474
I care, but the reason
it took so long for me to make detective

32:56.474 --> 33:01.688
is because if he was lying to me
that much all the time and I didn't know,

33:02.230 --> 33:04.440
how could I be some detective?

33:05.525 --> 33:08.069
Cut to Delgado asks, "Is Mike a murderer?"

33:08.069 --> 33:09.529
I say "Of course not."

33:09.529 --> 33:13.658
But how would I know?
Can I even trust my own instincts anymore?

33:13.658 --> 33:16.536
I think I need to know what he's doing.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.205
What do you think?

33:20.581 --> 33:24.168
I think this is
a very one-sided relationship.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.191
Here, let me give you a hand with that.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.614
We're almost done.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.241
How's our girl?

34:14.886 --> 34:15.720
Hello?

34:17.221 --> 34:18.181
Who is it?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.600
- Security. This is--
- Go away!

34:20.600 --> 34:21.976
This is private property.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.144
Stay away from me!

34:23.144 --> 34:26.230
Okay, just-- Just-- Just-- Just step back.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.232
- I said, stay away!
- Okay, okay.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.651
I'm right here. I'm not moving.

34:31.986 --> 34:34.197
I thought it would be a longer drop.

34:34.697 --> 34:36.532
- God.
- Maybe...

34:37.700 --> 34:40.453
Maybe you wanna come in
for a minute first.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.538
Right? Yeah.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.166
I think the kitchen has cookies.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.086
- Cookies?
- Yeah.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.842
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:54.842 --> 34:59.472
Okay, just-- Yeah, just watch your step.
Those shoes look very uncomfortable.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.602
You can stay here as long as you want.
It's warm in here.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.938
She's got him. They're going inside.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.440
We've got 45 minutes starting now.
Let's get cracking.

35:22.411 --> 35:26.040
Careful how fast you feed the chain.
Match the rate with Rob's

35:26.040 --> 35:28.292
so that you can support
the weight from up here.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.294
Buzz?

35:30.920 --> 35:33.089
- Buzz.

35:37.927 --> 35:38.761
Buzz!

35:39.512 --> 35:40.805
Yeah. On it.

35:50.148 --> 35:50.982
Here you go.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.443
Thank you.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.124
Can I ask your name?

36:11.294 --> 36:12.128
Kit.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.590
Short for Katherine?

36:16.132 --> 36:16.966
Yeah.

36:17.466 --> 36:18.384
I like it.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.765
I know I don't know your situation--

36:24.765 --> 36:28.352
No offense, Eric, but I don't need you
telling me all I have to live for.

36:28.352 --> 36:31.397
"You're young, have everything.
Your life's just getting started."

36:31.397 --> 36:36.736
Reminding me that I'm staring at four
or five more decades of feeling this way

36:36.736 --> 36:38.487
is some shitty salesmanship.

36:43.117 --> 36:46.746
I mean,
having everything isn't everything.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.665
And you don't, do you?

36:54.670 --> 36:56.380
I don't really have anything.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.609

in the world.

37:19.904 --> 37:23.449
A little boy, Alex, just smart as a whip.

37:24.492 --> 37:28.329
Volunteer coach for the girls soccer team.
I was allowed to be around kids back then.

37:31.290 --> 37:33.084
But when it all went away--

37:33.084 --> 37:34.001
No.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.631
No, Eric, when you made it all go away
because of the choices you made.

37:40.925 --> 37:44.929
Well, I learned the difference
in what I want and what I need.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.890
