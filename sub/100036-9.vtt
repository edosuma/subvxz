00:01.369 --> 00:02.412
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.436 --> 00:05.073
My nephew came back
into my life.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.640
No matter how much
I told him to scram.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.976
You should come
to Philly with me.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.379
For Thanksgiving.

00:11.412 --> 00:15.015
Deja, I'm sorry we haven't
taken you to see Shauna.

00:15.049 --> 00:17.485
I'd actually like
to invite her here.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
For Thanksgiving.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.055
Aw, open up.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.357
- There you go.
- Oh, my, this is...

00:23.391 --> 00:25.326
Well, this is terrible timing.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.995
Kate, you did it.
He's eating it.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.264
First solid food, buddy.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.899
I'm not gonna go see some doctor

00:31.932 --> 00:33.867
just because
you're overreacting.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.545
- I'm just worried that there could be...
- I said I'm fine.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.338
- Mom.
- Randall!

00:37.371 --> 00:39.107
Enough.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.848
- I hate Thanksgiving.
- Shh. Nicky.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.059
And Layne finishes it out,

00:49.083 --> 00:50.851
hitting the 101 mark

00:50.884 --> 00:53.621
in touchdown passes
for a Lions win, 28 to 24.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.689
- Yes.
- Dang it.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.891
Pay up, daddy-O.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.528
Jack!

01:00.561 --> 01:03.664
Nicky! Where the hell are you?

01:06.834 --> 01:08.836
It's okay.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.778 --> 01:21.915
What, too much thankfulness
going on in there?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.993
Huh. Grandpa's three sheets
to the wind and won't stop

01:24.017 --> 01:26.654
asking me if I'm scared
of being drafted next week.

01:26.687 --> 01:30.057
Mom burned the bird
and Dad's about to blow.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.892
And it's only 11:00.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.637
Well, it's the best day
of the year, every single year,

01:33.661 --> 01:34.795
like clockwork, isn't it?

01:34.828 --> 01:36.029
Oh, yeah.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.932
You want to split?

01:38.966 --> 01:41.469
And just ditch Thanksgiving?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.514
Shoot.

01:56.684 --> 01:57.851
Yo. Ready to, uh,

01:57.885 --> 01:59.353
hit the road to Philly?

01:59.387 --> 02:01.355
Wow, well, look at you.
You look sharp.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.657
- I look like I'm in a Viagra commercial.
- You do not.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.594
You look very, uh,
you know, newly sober chic.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.330
I'm not sure about this, Kevin.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.764
I'm telling you.
I'm 100% on this.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.342
Pleated pants are in.
GQ did a whole spread.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.702
I'm not talking about
pleated pants, you nitwit.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.146
Uh, coming to your brother's
for Thanksgiving,

02:16.170 --> 02:18.639
you know,
with your whole family.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.642
- Nicky, everyone's really excited to see you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.977
They are... It's gonna be
perfect, trust me. Okay?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.455
What are you gonna
do about that monstrosity

02:25.479 --> 02:27.215
of a trailer out there?

02:27.248 --> 02:30.818
Uh, I don't... I haven't, you
know, called to return it yet.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.653
I don't...

02:32.686 --> 02:34.464
I-I was thinking, you know,
after Thanksgiving,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.056
I'd drive you back here

02:36.089 --> 02:37.958
and maybe spend
a little more time in Bradford.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.161
- Really? Hmm.
- Maybe.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
All right.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.839
Good morning, my turkeys.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.674
Good morning, my giblets.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.819
This would be easier to do
if you had two hands, you know?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.821
Hey, why are we setting up
a card table in the foyer?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.847
'Cause our dining table
only seats eight,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.425
and we've expecting 13 guests...

03:01.449 --> 03:03.651
with all the birth moms
and long-lost uncles.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.985
Yeah.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.920
- Just lean in, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.056
Hey, Deja. You look nice.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.858
Uh, you sure it's not too fancy?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.860
- I think your mom will love it.
- Thanks.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.396
Um, I don't know.
I'm still gonna change.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.197
I'm not feeling it.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.233
Oh, dear God,

03:19.267 --> 03:21.168
please let Shauna be okay.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.605
Deja is so nervous. I just want
today to go well for her.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.607
Amen.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.279
Just go talk to her.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.247
It's Thanksgiving.

03:33.281 --> 03:37.084
She probably wants to make up
as much as you do.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.021
Hey.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.257
You guys are up
and cooking already, huh?

03:43.291 --> 03:46.026
Mm-hmm.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.263
So, Randall, I'm putting, uh,
chorizo in the stuffing.

03:49.297 --> 03:52.099
- Barefoot Contessa-style.
- Nice.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.569
Mom, Kevin and Uncle Nicky are
en route and Kate just texted.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.272
- Their flight is on time.
- Great.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.107
Okay, so I'm gonna go set up

04:00.140 --> 04:01.975
the VCR for Police Academy 3,

04:02.009 --> 04:04.044
and let you guys have
an opportunity to talk.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.679
Cool.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.952
I got all
the traditional staples.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.589
The saltines, the hot dogs,
the Kraft Singles.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.504
Randall, I did not forget.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.740
I was just gonna
make myself some tea.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.942
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.953
You know, I also managed to make
the cranberry sauce this morning

04:36.977 --> 04:40.280
- without blowing up the house.
- Of course you did.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.586
Mom, I didn't mean
to overstep last night.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.488
- I'm sorry if I...
- Yeah, you know, I-I...

04:47.521 --> 04:49.857
really want to try
and put last night behind us.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.792
I know. Me, too.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.427
But at some point,
we need to talk about

04:53.461 --> 04:54.838
what's going on with you.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.673
- If we think this...
- Okay. I need some space.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.699
I need to get out of here
for a minute.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.534
- Where are you going, Mom?
- I don't know.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.170
I'm gonna go get dressed
and just take a walk,

05:03.203 --> 05:06.874
clear my head, I don't kn...
Maybe I'll go see a movie.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.909
I'll be back in time for dinner.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.546
And I would, um, appreciate it

05:12.580 --> 05:17.250
if you kept this little argument
of ours between us.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.656
- Of course.
- Okay.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.559
I will pick up a pie
on the way back.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.497
Dad, I can't find
the Thanksgiving box.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.365
The Pilgrim Rick hat is in it.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.747
Oh, and there's this really
funny hat that your Grandpa Jack

05:37.771 --> 05:39.540
used to wear.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.842
Oh, and we'll be listening
to Police Academy 3.

05:41.875 --> 05:46.146
Which is kind of like PAW Patrol
but with humans and swearing.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.048
My CrossFit group text

05:48.081 --> 05:51.318
is going crazy for Jack's
first solid food video.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.020
They love it, buddy. Huh?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.355
And-and my Insta is-is,
like, blowing up.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.059
The likes just keep rolling in.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.996
- Toby, I have to tell you something.
- Okay.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.434
Um, and listen,
I am, I am so, so sorry.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.368
It was a total accident.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.004
But, um...

06:11.038 --> 06:13.016
Jack's first avocado was
actually at Gregory's house

06:13.040 --> 06:14.608
when you weren't home.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.244
What?

06:17.277 --> 06:20.013
Yeah, he just, he wasn't
taking food that morning,

06:20.047 --> 06:22.850
and-and when he went...
When Gregory went to feed him,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.518
I just, I didn't stop him
and then...

06:24.552 --> 06:26.954
Wow. This is...

06:26.987 --> 06:29.723
So-so, you've just been lying
to me for the last 24 hours?

06:29.757 --> 06:31.559
Tobe.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.394
You feeding Jack was still
a real beautiful moment.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.064
Was it, Kate?
'Cause thinking back on it now,

06:37.097 --> 06:39.132
it seems kind of humiliating.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.603
Okay... Toby, I'm home alone
all day with Jack.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.605
Okay? And things
are gonna happen.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.607
So what if he takes
his-his first steps

06:46.640 --> 06:47.984
when you're at CrossFit?
What am I gonna do?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.385
Should I, should I
just knock him down?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.211
Yeah, okay, no, so it's my fault

06:51.244 --> 06:53.781
that you fed him an avocado
and then lied to me about it.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.415
Because I was at the gym.
Okay, got it.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.084
I did not say it was your fault.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.386
I meant that... You know what?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.089
I'm sorry,

07:02.122 --> 07:05.058
a-and I'm just, I'm tired.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.660
Yeah.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.672
- It's okay.
- You know what? It's okay.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.799
It's okay.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.400
We're all tire...
We're all tired.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.603
It's probably why
I am overreacting

07:15.636 --> 07:19.306
to AvocadoGate here.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.277
There will be plenty
of firsts, right?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.579
Right.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.982
Like his first Thanksgiving.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.184
- Yeah.
- This is your first one, buddy.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.655
It's gonna be awesome. Yeah.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.446
You know, I can't believe
you bet against Dallas

07:50.470 --> 07:52.472
just because Dad
loves the Cowboys.

07:52.506 --> 07:53.541
And with Jonny?

07:55.042 --> 07:57.277
- Yeah.
- Touchdown Cowboys.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.547
The extra point will tie it up.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.981
Hey, how much did you bet,

08:01.014 --> 08:04.818
- anyhow?
- Mm. 200 bucks.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.521
- 200? Jesus...
- It's not like I can bring it with me.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.557
You know what, stop.
You're not going to Vietnam.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.125
You are not gonna get
your number called next week.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.962
And the kick is good.

08:14.995 --> 08:19.299
The Cowboys are going to
escape with a 24-24 tie.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.004
Oh, co... What are you
grinning about? I-It...

08:24.037 --> 08:25.973
ended in a tie.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.741
All right? You got lucky.
It's a push.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.743
No, it's not.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.313
What do you got, points?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.248
Jonny gave you points?

08:35.282 --> 08:37.250
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.986
Thanks, Jonny.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.559
- How much money is that?
- It's a lot.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.238
It's really nice

08:58.271 --> 09:00.440
- to finally meet you, Nicky.
- Oh.

09:00.473 --> 09:03.176
Hey, this place is amazing.
You call this downsizing?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.779
Don't test me, brother-in-law.
And, uh, what fell on your face?

09:05.813 --> 09:07.581
Uh, walked into a wall.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.593
- All good.
- Uh, it would be in the attic.

09:09.617 --> 09:12.085
Yeah, the cardboard box labeled
"Thanksgiving" or "Holidays."

09:12.119 --> 09:14.955
- Thank you so much for checking.
- Come on. My brother.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.399
Happy Thanksgiving.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.891
What happened to your face?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.292
Eh, fly ball to the face.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.695
Yeah. Nicky.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.131
You look amazing.
Kevin Queer Eyed you, huh?

09:24.164 --> 09:26.433
I don't know what that means.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.935
- He does.
- Uncle Kevin!

09:27.968 --> 09:30.503
Hey! There she is.
Happy Thanksgiving.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.475
Thank you

09:35.508 --> 09:37.645
so much, yes. I'll see you soon.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.379
Great news.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.790
The new owners of our old house
found the box

09:40.814 --> 09:43.116
- of holiday stuff in the attic.
- Randall...

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
- Yes.
- You are really not gonna drive

09:44.952 --> 09:46.553
all that way just to get a box

09:46.586 --> 09:48.155
of our old Thanksgiving
tradition stuff?

09:48.188 --> 09:49.957
I'll go get my coat.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.625
That's my girl!

09:51.659 --> 09:52.836
All right, well,
hurry your ass up,

09:52.860 --> 09:54.470
because Shauna's
gonna be here at 2:00 and

09:54.494 --> 09:56.472
I don't want to be here alone
if she shows up in a bad way.

09:56.496 --> 09:59.432
- Understood.
- Uh, think I could ride along?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.568
You... They're going to Jersey.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.271
I don't mind. Gives me time
to get to know Russell.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.973
- It's Randall.
- See?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.641
Uh...

10:07.675 --> 10:11.511
It's fine, Kev.
Annie, you're driving.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.352
Where's my mom?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.210
William?

10:48.015 --> 10:50.283
Hey.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.895
You know, I've been here for,
like, ten minutes.

10:51.919 --> 10:52.996
You didn't come down and say hi?

10:53.020 --> 10:56.389
Hey, Uncle Kev.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.625
That is not my niece's
beautiful smile.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.393
What's wrong? Tell me.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.362
Testify! Get it?

11:02.395 --> 11:04.664
Tess-tify.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.666
I don't really want
to talk about it.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.235
Oh, come on.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.046
Besides, I need something
to get my mind off of

11:10.070 --> 11:11.638
worrying about my uncle so much.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.073
Fine.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.342
There's this stupid meme
going around school

11:15.375 --> 11:17.711
that everybody's posting
on Instagram.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.549
"Post a pic of your number one
celebrity crush." Oh.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.218
So what's going on?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.821
I haven't come out
at school yet.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.691
So I could post nothing
and be left out.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.027
Or I can post the truth.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.929
I have a crush on Zendaya.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.899
Yeah?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.100
That's my choice, too.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.403
But your life won't
completely explode

11:43.436 --> 11:45.538
if you say it.

11:47.941 --> 11:50.410
Hey, let's get out of here.
Let's get a bite.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.055
- There's so much food here.
- Yeah, but I need air.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.413
You know? I need air.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.648
- Let's go get some air. Come on.
- Okay.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.587
All right, we're off to get
a pre-turkey snack.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.092
And then there was Beth.

12:06.827 --> 12:10.130
Uh, what am I, chopped liver?

12:10.163 --> 12:13.033
Aw, Migs...

12:13.066 --> 12:14.902
You know I love you.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.275
Shauna, hi.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.377
I know I'm crazy early...

12:24.411 --> 12:26.546
Oh, that's no problem.
Come on in.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.781
How you doing?

12:27.815 --> 12:31.051
Good, Beth. Really, really good.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.787
Good. Deja told me
you got a new job.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.555
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.625
I'm working the front desk
at Delaware General Hospital.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.728
The hours are long but
the benefits are really good.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.764
Wow. That's fantastic.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.400
This is a pineapple
upside down cake.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.102
It's Deja's favorite, so...

12:49.136 --> 12:50.413
Oh, she's gonna love that.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.439
You're early.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.644
Tater Tot. Oh! Mm...

12:57.677 --> 13:00.247
My God, you are so grown.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.516
And you're so beautiful.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.453
You look better than ever, baby.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.488
You, too, Mom.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.424
Um, you want to help me
make cookies?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.693
Lead the way.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.270
William?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.906
Excuse me, William, it's...

13:27.407 --> 13:29.709
Can I help you with something?

13:29.742 --> 13:33.380
I'm sorry, I thought...

13:33.413 --> 13:35.815
I thought you were someone else.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.051
Oh, well,

13:38.085 --> 13:40.087
sorry to disappoint.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.791
Uh, are you all right?

13:44.824 --> 13:49.162
I'm... I am, I'm just
not from around here.

13:54.434 --> 13:58.305
Actually, um, could you tell me
if there's a bakery nearby,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.874
because I need to
pick something up.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.010
- Hmm, a bakery?
- Mm-hmm.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.213
Well, there is a nice grocery
store around the corner.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.916
Fresh-made whipped cream cakes.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
Yes. Yes.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.652
That's what I'm looking for.
Perfect.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.122
Thank you very much.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.582
Thank you to Dad
for loving the Cowboys,

14:33.606 --> 14:35.275
and thank you to me
for hating Dad.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.619
Could you just... Could you
put it away, all right?

14:36.643 --> 14:38.946
- Look, people are gonna start watching.
- Let them watch.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.223
It's probably more dough
than they've seen

14:40.247 --> 14:41.548
in their entire life.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.551
Well, it's more money than we've
seen in our entire life.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.286
Here's to that. Whoa, hey.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.554
Oh, here we go.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.888
Here we go.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.799
You realize this is
five pounds of shrimp?

14:50.823 --> 14:54.027
- Oh, we realize. Mm-hmm.
- Good luck.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.862
Don't need luck.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.132
This is a Thanksgiving
dinner, huh?

14:59.166 --> 15:01.935
Cheers.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.810
Good job.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.412
Hey, Deja, check this out.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.381
Whiskey Business.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.216
- You get it?
- What?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.550
Come on.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.155
You don't know that?
You're too young.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.291
Oh, Deja, come here, come here.

15:24.324 --> 15:27.927
Look what just popped up
on my Facebook timeline.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.963
Nine years ago today.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.100
- My first Cupid Shuffle.
- Oh, look at your little feet go.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.802
I remember that night.
Mrs. Henderson was so pissed.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.971
Hey, Beth. You okay?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.011
All right.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.246
Here's the thing about AA, okay?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.681
A big part of it is
sort of taking things

15:48.715 --> 15:50.650
one day at a time, okay?

15:50.683 --> 15:53.586
One step at a time,
one person at a time.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.654
Okay.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.189
Okay, so it got me thinking

15:56.223 --> 15:58.625
instead of coming out
to everyone all at once, right,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.693
well, what if you just
come out to one person?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.429
Just a complete stranger.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.007
Someone you don't even have
to look in the eye. Right?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.132
Just to see how it feels.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.535
You want me to come out to...

16:08.568 --> 16:11.504
The drive-through speaker. Yeah.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.506
Yeah. No pressure, though.
Okay? No pressure.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.008
Only if you want.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.876
But, I mean, think about it.
All right?

16:16.909 --> 16:18.221
What could be less scary
than coming out

16:18.245 --> 16:20.080
to a-a plastic clown head?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.815
Oh, here we go.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.125
Welcome to Happy Burger.
What can I get you?

16:32.159 --> 16:34.527
Tell you what, I'm gonna do
a number four

16:34.561 --> 16:37.230
and a chocolate shake.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.036
I'm Tess Pearson, and I'm gay.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.174
Uh, cool.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.143
You want fries or onion rings
with that number four?

16:50.177 --> 16:51.711
Fries, please.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.524
- Hey, happy Thanksgiving.
- It's so good to be here.

16:55.548 --> 16:59.219
Oh, my gosh, guys,
he's so beautiful.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.488
Must be all the avocado.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.923
I'm on the Gram now.
BigMig45. You should follow me.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.996
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, our boy loves avocado.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.529
Hey, do you guys have room
for this in your fridge?

17:09.561 --> 17:12.199
It's, uh, it's my tempeh.
I'm on a special diet.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.067
- We travel with tempeh now.
- Oh. Yeah.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.421
- I'll find some room in the fridge for it.
- Yeah, thanks.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.839
Oh, my God, this apartment...
This is downsizing?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.675
- Yeah.
- Come on.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.577
Wait, where is everyone?

17:27.280 --> 17:30.283
And every year, someone wears it

17:30.317 --> 17:32.452
and pretends to be Pilgrim Rick.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.054
Wait, you're Grandpa Jack's
brother, right?

17:35.088 --> 17:36.556
Yes.

17:36.589 --> 17:40.059
So why haven't we met before?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.395
Because your grandfather
erased me.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.209
Hey, Annie, why don't you
go ring the doorbell?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.202
We'll be right there. Nicky...

17:49.236 --> 17:50.370
are you okay?

17:50.403 --> 17:51.571
Yeah. I'm sorry.

17:51.604 --> 17:52.939
I...

17:54.741 --> 17:57.444
I thought I could handle this,
but it's too much.

17:57.477 --> 18:01.781
I mean, his own granddaughter
has never even heard of me.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.459
I knew he'd never talked
about me that much,

18:03.483 --> 18:04.884
but I don't know...

18:06.819 --> 18:08.888
- Hello?
- Yeah.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.989
You must be Randall.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.591
- I am.
- Come on in.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.925
Thank you.

18:12.959 --> 18:17.130
Whoa. Everything is different.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.574
But I love what
you've done with the place.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.500
Thank you.
It's such a beautiful house.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.336
It really was... is.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.238
It really is.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.574
- Here's your holiday box.
- Thank you.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.342
Grandpa Jack's hat!

18:29.376 --> 18:32.979
- Now we're talking.
- Yes.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.915
Oh, I also found these.
Uh, are these yours?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.150
Um...

18:39.986 --> 18:43.156
Yeah.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.092
Sorry, my mom gave me these
as a housewarming gift

18:46.125 --> 18:48.127
when we first moved in here.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.130
Nobody loves music like my mom.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.110
Excuse me. Hi.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.845
Could you tell me where
the bakery is?

19:05.878 --> 19:07.122
Yeah, it's just straight
down there

19:07.146 --> 19:08.791
past the checkout aisles,
you can't miss it.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.750
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.776
Ooh, so pretty.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.044
That'll be $16.05.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.880
Okay.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.017
These...

20:18.050 --> 20:19.786
bottomless purses,
I tell you what,

20:19.819 --> 20:23.122
they're all the rage, but you
can never find anything in them.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.092
Sorry. Okay.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.065
I haven't eaten anything today.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.368
I think that's why
my brain's a little fuzzy.

20:35.402 --> 20:38.070
Good Chinese place
down the street.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.807
Oh, that does sound good.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.277
Okay. Thank you very much.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.514
Thank you.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.260
Wait, so there's
no dairy in this?

21:01.294 --> 21:03.396
- 100% cashew, m'lady.
- Wow.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.298
This is some
damn good nut cheese.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.975
- Right? That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, best I've ever had.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.001
That whole tray is nut-based.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.771
- What?
- Look, you get in the box with me for one week,

21:11.804 --> 21:14.240
come meet my trainer KJ,
we'll get you on a meal plan,

21:14.273 --> 21:17.276
you'll lose five pounds...
Bang... like that.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.478
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:18.511 --> 21:22.615
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.085
Not a bunch of weight, just...

21:26.118 --> 21:28.455
Are you okay?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.790
Yeah.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.994
I'm ashamed. It's evil.
I'm evil, you know.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.929
I can't even say it out loud.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.798
OKAY, WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS:

21:38.831 --> 21:41.568
you tell me your evil feeling
and I'll tell you mine.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.176
I hate that Shauna's
doing so well.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.145
Okay, that is bad.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.547
I know, I know.

21:54.581 --> 21:57.283
I was praying for her
last night.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.285
Like, praying on my knees

21:59.318 --> 22:02.054
that she would show up here
today in a good place,

22:02.088 --> 22:06.225
but then... I see them
together watching

22:06.258 --> 22:09.696
home videos, or busting out
inside jokes, and I don't know.

22:09.729 --> 22:13.065
It's just simpler for Randall.

22:13.099 --> 22:15.134
He's the only father
she's ever known,

22:15.167 --> 22:18.805
but she already has a mom,

22:18.838 --> 22:20.740
you know?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.109
Where does that leave me?

22:27.947 --> 22:31.618
Okay, I said my terrible thing,
you say yours.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.389
I hate CrossFit Toby.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.226
I do, I do.

22:40.259 --> 22:42.862
I hate his food charts,
his "fat blocks,"

22:42.895 --> 22:44.697
his CrossFit acronyms.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.599
- What?
- Yeah.

22:46.633 --> 22:49.101
You know, the first thing
I said to him when we met

22:49.135 --> 22:51.003
was that I couldn't fall
for a fat person

22:51.037 --> 22:52.415
'cause I was determined
to lose the weight,

22:52.439 --> 22:54.040
I don't want anyone
to get in my way,

22:54.073 --> 22:56.242
- and we-we broke up over it.
- Yeah.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.445
And then we committed
to losing the weight together,

22:58.478 --> 23:00.913
but we didn't.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.452
And then we had a baby,

23:05.485 --> 23:08.688
a baby with special needs,

23:08.721 --> 23:11.791
and I have never been
more stressed, more tired,

23:11.824 --> 23:15.294
more overwhelmed
in my entire life.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.564
And then he goes
and loses the weight,

23:17.597 --> 23:21.434
which is amazing,
but all I can think is he did it

23:21.468 --> 23:24.236
without me.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.406
You sh... you should tell him
how you feel.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.042
N... I wouldn't even
know how to.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.378
Honey, just figure it out

23:32.411 --> 23:34.246
'cause if you're only going
to other people

23:34.280 --> 23:37.116
about what's happening
in your marriage, it's...

23:37.149 --> 23:39.919
it can be dangerous territory.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.526
Why don't you pick one of those
and pop it in, Uncle Nicky?

23:57.036 --> 23:59.171
Leonard Cohen?

23:59.205 --> 24:03.275
Oh, man, my dad
used to love this song.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.678
"So Long Marianne."

24:05.712 --> 24:07.947
Loved listening to it.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.517
Loved explaining it to us
even more.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.519
Over and over...

24:12.552 --> 24:14.630
This next song
was requested via mail from one of

24:14.654 --> 24:16.155
our brave troops in Vietnam.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.467
Hoping you're having some kind
of Thanksgiving there, boys.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.459
Your loved ones
sure are missing you here.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.697
No, no, no, no. Leave it.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.033
It's Leonard Cohen. He's a poet.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.768
Nicky, if I wanted a poem,
I'd read a book.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.870
No, you wouldn't.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.172
Just listen.

24:33.205 --> 24:34.941
He's singing about

24:34.974 --> 24:38.611
the love of his life
moving on from him,

24:38.645 --> 24:41.313
but there's no bitterness
in him.

24:41.347 --> 24:44.884
He's just grateful
to have loved her.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.356
He was lost before he met her

24:50.389 --> 24:52.859
and then she became his home.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.894
And in the chorus, listen,
he's saying goodbye,

24:54.927 --> 24:57.296
but he can't quite let go.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.580
He's sending her away
and calling her back

25:13.613 --> 25:15.982
in the same breath.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.988
I just hope that
she came back to him

25:22.021 --> 25:23.823
and that they laughed again.

25:51.117 --> 25:56.055
I hope she went back to him
and they laughed together again.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.590
Something my dad
would always say

25:57.624 --> 25:59.626
whenever he listened
to this song.

25:59.659 --> 26:03.630
Uh, nope, he called it a poem.

26:03.663 --> 26:07.734
He'd give us all kind of hell
if we called it a song.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.414
Can we, uh, make a quick stop

26:22.448 --> 26:24.617
on the way home?

26:24.651 --> 26:26.986
Sure.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.229
- Everything good?
- It was delicious.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.266
Thank you very much.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.109
I just had it.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.316
Come on.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.352
Um, ma'am? Hi. Sorry.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.254
Um, I need to call my son,

27:02.288 --> 27:04.256
and I can't find my phone.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.358
Um, uh, do you,
do you have a phone

27:06.392 --> 27:07.694
that I can use?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.595
A telephone?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.964
- To call... Yeah.
- Oh.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.465
Uh, great.

27:16.035 --> 27:17.503
God.

27:17.536 --> 27:20.006
I don't know his number.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.141
I can't...
His number is in my phone,

27:22.174 --> 27:24.010
and I need my phone to call him.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.879
I need to call my son.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.481
You're not helping me right now.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.183
I need to call my...

27:42.194 --> 27:43.371
You found it.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.563
- There it is.
- Hey, Tobe.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.032
- Yeah?
- Talk to you for a minute?

27:46.065 --> 27:47.700
Yeah, of course.
Just give me one sec.

27:47.734 --> 27:52.471
These are sweet potatoes.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.673
They are orange.

27:54.707 --> 27:58.410
They're like the regular
potato's sassy aunt.

28:03.615 --> 28:04.851
What's up?

28:07.586 --> 28:09.621
Happy Thanksgiving.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.692
Happy Thanksgiving.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.594
All right.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.341
Oh, come on,
that was pass interference.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.601
Hey, you like football now?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.703
Oh, Dej,
I'm a die-hard Eagles fan.

28:24.737 --> 28:27.706
- I bleed green and white.
- Since when?

28:27.740 --> 28:29.608
Well, some friends
from work get together

28:29.641 --> 28:31.510
every Sunday
and watch the games.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.279
We all bring different dishes,
do a potluck.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.381
I've gotten really into it.

28:39.285 --> 28:42.221
Sounds like fun.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.223
Um, excuse me a second.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.360
After you.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.262
Hey. Shauna.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.698
You're early.
It's good to see you.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.466
You look great.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.603
Uh, Nicky, this is Shauna.
She's our, uh,

28:57.636 --> 29:01.307
- adopted daughter's biological mother.
- Okay.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.576
- Yeah.
- Um, I need a platter.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.478
Oh, it's in the pantry.
Right here.

29:06.512 --> 29:07.823
- Oh, got it.
- I'll be right with you, Shauna.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.616
I can't wait to catch up.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.218
Is my mom here?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.586
- Not yet, baby.
- Huh.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.823
- How's Shauna?
- She's good.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.657
She has a job and an apartment,

29:18.690 --> 29:20.827
and, um, made
an upside down cake.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.061
That's a good thing?

29:22.094 --> 29:24.496
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I'll be right back, okay?

29:24.530 --> 29:28.134
Okay. Hey, guys. One sec.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.745
You're reached
Rebecca Pearson. Please leave a message.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.405
Hey, Mom. Uh, you haven't
returned any of my texts

29:33.439 --> 29:35.074
and now your phone's off.

29:35.107 --> 29:38.577
Trying not to worry, but, um,
it's almost time to eat,

29:38.610 --> 29:42.748
so hope you're close.
Please come home.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.451
Bye. What's up, sis?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.854
- Hi.
- How're you doing?

29:47.887 --> 29:50.789
Hey.

29:50.823 --> 29:54.260
We're gonna sit down to dinner
as soon as Rebecca gets back.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.561
Cool.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.765
Your mom seems like
she's doing pretty great.

30:01.467 --> 30:05.437
She is. She-she loves
her new job,

30:05.471 --> 30:08.875
and she has a whole bunch
of friends.

30:08.908 --> 30:13.445
She has a new apartment
and it sounds real nice, too,

30:13.479 --> 30:16.715
um, even has a fireplace.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.153
When I was growing up,

30:21.187 --> 30:25.124
we'd always say one day
that we'd have a fireplace.

30:25.157 --> 30:29.395
Now... she finally has one.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.736
Why couldn't she
be like this for me?

30:37.769 --> 30:40.639
Oh, honey.

30:47.713 --> 30:49.215
Hey,

30:49.248 --> 30:53.319
tell me the story
about that video.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.154
What?

30:55.187 --> 30:57.089
With you and your mom
and the dancing.

30:57.123 --> 31:00.359
- Oh.
- Tell me about that day.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.761
Um...

31:02.794 --> 31:04.696
Yeah, I got it.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.067
Our downstairs neighbor,
Mrs. Henderson,

31:08.100 --> 31:11.737
um, she was as mean
as they come,

31:11.770 --> 31:14.941
and... on that morning,

31:14.974 --> 31:18.410
she was out front and
she asked me what we were doing

31:18.444 --> 31:19.845
for Thanksgiving and I told her

31:19.878 --> 31:22.714
we were bringing in takeout.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.883
And then she said something

31:24.917 --> 31:29.221
about how my mama
wasn't raising me right

31:29.255 --> 31:31.723
and how maybe
if she knew how to cook,

31:31.757 --> 31:33.692
she'd be able
to keep a man around.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.095
- Ugh, Mrs. Henderson.
- Right?

31:36.128 --> 31:41.067
And my mom knew Mrs. Henderson
hated when we made noise,

31:41.100 --> 31:44.570
so there was no better revenge
in her mind

31:44.603 --> 31:47.706
than teaching me
the Cupid Shuffle.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.277
I mean, music cranked
all the way up,

31:51.310 --> 31:53.412
feet stomping as loud
as we could stomp.

31:53.445 --> 31:56.382
- Genius.
- It was... it was perfect.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.819
Hey.

32:00.852 --> 32:05.091
You may not have gotten
the fireplace, but...

32:05.124 --> 32:07.126
don't let yourself
forget all the times

32:07.159 --> 32:10.596
you had with her
when she was absolutely perfect.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.534
Yeah.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.322
Thank you for the
ride, Officers, but this is all

32:27.346 --> 32:29.015
really unnecessary.

32:29.048 --> 32:32.584
You're a long way
from Los Angeles.

32:32.618 --> 32:37.123
Yeah. I'm out here
visiting family.

32:37.156 --> 32:40.026
We always get together
for special occasions.

32:57.909 --> 32:59.645
- Hey, hey.
- So...

32:59.678 --> 33:01.356
Tell me, how did... you know,
how'd it go with Uncle Nicky?

33:01.380 --> 33:02.648
Dude, it went great.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.559
- Really?
- He's in the kitchen fixing something

33:04.583 --> 33:08.787
to add to our dinner. Been very
secretive about it. It's cute.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.057
- He is cute.
- Yeah.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.125
- And still no Mom?
- No.

33:13.159 --> 33:15.994
Why would she go off by herself
on Thanksgiving?

33:16.028 --> 33:18.297
She must've really wanted to see
that new De Niro movie.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.367
- Do you know who Steve Guttenberg is?
- Yeah.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.840
He is one of my
top three favorite...

33:25.704 --> 33:27.339
What about Michael Winslow?

33:27.373 --> 33:30.209
- Excuse me.
- A sound effects genius.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.744
Excuse me. Uh...

33:34.780 --> 33:37.849
Well, I've learned that, uh...

33:37.883 --> 33:40.052
traditions inspired
by Jack Pearson

33:40.086 --> 33:42.088
are sort of the backbone
of this shindig.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.556
So...

33:44.590 --> 33:47.193
So, uh... here goes.

33:47.226 --> 33:49.161
Uh...

33:49.195 --> 33:51.530
Thanksgivings growing up

33:51.563 --> 33:54.266
weren't... you know, jolly

33:54.300 --> 33:56.435
like this.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.606
But... we made do.

34:02.374 --> 34:06.845
So how bent you think
the old man's gonna be?

34:06.878 --> 34:09.114
I think this one's
gonna be a doozy.

34:15.721 --> 34:19.190
It was actually
the best Thanksgiving ever.

34:19.225 --> 34:23.395
Okay, so then,
we'll do it again next year.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.864
And the year after that.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.068
And then again,
the year after that.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.942
And we would've
kept that promise.

34:36.975 --> 34:39.277
And we would've kept
that tradition.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.281
But life, you know?

34:42.313 --> 34:45.117
Got in the way.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.289
So...

34:51.357 --> 34:54.960
Here is five pounds
of Thanksgiving shrimp.

34:56.995 --> 34:59.631
Yeah.

35:01.967 --> 35:03.369
It's for Jack.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.007
My brother. And, uh...

35:10.709 --> 35:14.713
Yeah, to new...
family traditions, so...

35:15.781 --> 35:18.784
- Enjoy.
- Hear, hear.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.857
Jack, five-minute warning.
Everyone'll be here soon.

35:25.891 --> 35:28.294
- Those hot dogs smell amazing.
- I know.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.197
Our baby and I
need to eat them stat.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.999
Have some shrimp.
There's five pounds.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.150
It was really beautiful,
Uncle Nicky.

35:52.184 --> 35:54.820
Eh... Hey, kid.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.057
I think it's time for you
to get back to L.A.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.359
Live your own life.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.061
I'm gonna be just fine, Kevin.

36:03.094 --> 36:06.565
And if I need you,
I'll call you.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.235
If you need me, you call me.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.574
- Okay.
- Good.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.075
Okay. Yeah.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.224
Feel like you disappeared on me.

36:46.605 --> 36:48.325
- Look at this Pilgrim Rick.
- Pilgrim Rick.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.419
I know, I know, I know.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.521
Kate, will you grab my phone
real quick before he melts down?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.747
- I got it.
- This is a special moment, Jack.

36:55.781 --> 36:58.917
- Oh...
- There we...

36:58.950 --> 37:00.428
That's what
you call full circle.

37:00.452 --> 37:02.297
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.955
Hey, Kate?

37:05.924 --> 37:09.561
Can you say shrimp? Can you say
five pounds of shrimp?

37:09.595 --> 37:13.098
- Kate? Photo? Huh? Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.076
- We don't want to miss this; he's gonna melt down.
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.568
Okay. Okay.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.036
Okay, ready?

37:18.069 --> 37:20.105
- Say "shrimp."
- Got it.

37:20.138 --> 37:21.373
Kevin!

37:21.407 --> 37:24.376
Yo. What do we got?

37:24.410 --> 37:25.811
How we doing?

37:25.844 --> 37:27.479
The comments.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.824
- That's what's up! See, this is great.
- I know.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.917
Look at this.
These are great... oh.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.552
- I sense joy here.
- Yes.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.621
- I could use some. What's happening?
- Well...

37:35.654 --> 37:36.931
Yeah, you can tell him.

37:36.955 --> 37:40.258
Your daughter
came out on Instagram today.

37:40.292 --> 37:41.860
- What?
- Yeah.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.063
Wow, Tess.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.599
- This is huge.
- Yeah. -Thanks. My phone is,

37:47.633 --> 37:49.411
like, blowing up.
I've got to go deal with this.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.236
- Yes.
- Yeah, of course, no.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.971
My goodness.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.140
- Well, look at you, Ray Donovan.
- Yeah.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.413
- Just fixing everybody.
- Well, I don't know about that.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.646
Brother. What's next for you?

38:00.679 --> 38:03.682
Uh, next is, um...

38:07.886 --> 38:09.187
I don't know, man.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.790
You know, I-I spent two months
in that small town.

38:11.823 --> 38:15.093
You know, spent every day
with-with two virtual strangers,

38:15.126 --> 38:17.496
and, uh... I got to tell you,

38:17.529 --> 38:19.106
I haven't had that feeling
since I was a kid.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.032
You know? Just...

38:21.066 --> 38:24.536
a feeling of, um...

38:24.570 --> 38:27.339
just being responsible
for other people. You know?

38:27.373 --> 38:30.609
Sense of a family. So...

38:30.642 --> 38:33.779
I liked it. You know?

38:33.812 --> 38:36.948
I liked it, so I think, um...

38:36.982 --> 38:38.717
I think that's what's next
for me.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.219
Yeah. For sure.

38:41.252 --> 38:42.621
Absolutely. By the time I'm 40,

38:42.654 --> 38:44.366
I'm gonna have a wife,
I'm gonna have a kid,

38:44.390 --> 38:47.225
- the whole shebang.
- You should probably date somebody first.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.695
You know, it's only nine months
till our birthday.

38:49.728 --> 38:52.030
Why you always got to be a buzzkill? Huh?

38:52.063 --> 38:54.533
By the way, where is Mom?
I'm starving.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.067
Are you starving? I'm starving.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.369
Uh...

39:05.544 --> 39:08.013
All right, ma'am, you're home.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.448
Everything's gonna be okay.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.875
- Mom. Come on in. Hi.
- Hi.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.244
Thank you very much
for bringing her home.

39:39.277 --> 39:41.179
Thank God.
Mom, we've been, you know,

39:41.212 --> 39:44.683
- calling nonstop.
- I'm sorry, I-I went out

39:44.716 --> 39:47.285
to try and get you
a birthday cake to surprise you,

39:47.318 --> 39:49.120
and then I got all...
turned around.

39:49.154 --> 39:52.924
- I hope I didn't ruin your whole party.
- No.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.994
- Happy 40th, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom. Thank you.

39:58.263 --> 40:01.567
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, Mom.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.503
- Here, I got you this.
- Thank you.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.774
You came back.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.375
I was getting worried.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.910
Of course I came back.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.045
That movie was
three and a half hours long,

40:14.079 --> 40:16.214
and then the line at the store
was huge.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.216
I left you a bunch of messages.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.319
Oh. I turned off my cell phone
for the movie.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.321
I must've forgotten
to turn it back on.

40:23.354 --> 40:25.457
I'm sorry.

40:25.491 --> 40:28.560
Hi, everyone.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.608
All right, thanks.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.109
Oh, how's she doing back there?

40:44.142 --> 40:46.111
Uh, she's laying down.
She's a little nauseous.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.013
My fiancée's

40:48.046 --> 40:51.950
got morning sickness
at all hours of the day, so...

40:51.983 --> 40:53.418
Oh, try ginger tea.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.953
- That always worked for me.
- Yeah?

40:54.986 --> 40:57.422
- Yeah.
- Ginger tea. Good tip. Thank you.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.258
And, um, thank you very much
for bringing my mom home.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.494
Yes, thank you.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.163
Good luck with that.

41:05.196 --> 41:07.098
Thank you.

41:07.132 --> 41:10.636
Kevin, is Randall here yet?

41:11.670 --> 41:14.005
No, Mom. Randall's not coming.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.241
We're not speaking, remember?

41:20.546 --> 41:23.181
Mmm, looks delicious.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.016
Hey.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.786
- And I'll just take that off your hands.
- Don't... Now...

41:27.819 --> 41:30.188
Stop. Hey.

41:30.221 --> 41:31.990
- Hmm?
- Um...

41:32.023 --> 41:34.526
I'm really sorry, Mom.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.894
About last night.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.329
I was probably overreacting
and...

41:38.363 --> 41:40.365
you know.

41:44.002 --> 41:48.406
I was halfway through
the trailer of Cats...

41:48.439 --> 41:52.410
when I couldn't remember
what movie I went to go see.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.451
I think I need to see a doctor.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.556
Okay.
