WEBVTT

02:02.187 --> 02:04.198
>> What are you thinking about?

02:05.828 --> 02:07.630
>> The interview.

02:12.274 --> 02:13.834
>> What about it?

02:16.036 --> 02:18.245
>> I'm nervous.

02:18.280 --> 02:21.171
>> What about it
makes you nervous?

02:21.206 --> 02:23.074
I won't be able to prove
that I can run Tempest

02:23.109 --> 02:24.647
and I'll lose my company.

02:24.682 --> 02:26.649
>> What do we do
when we're getting to that

02:26.684 --> 02:28.684
uncontrollable state?

02:35.220 --> 02:37.297
Very good.

02:37.332 --> 02:40.091
What is the worst
that can happen?

02:47.133 --> 02:50.035
>> I've been calling you.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.037
>> I didn't hear.

02:54.679 --> 02:57.284
>> I call you answer.

02:57.319 --> 03:01.046
That's how this works.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.454
>> I can handle this.

03:02.489 --> 03:04.214
>> Great.

03:04.249 --> 03:07.261
So we're not going to
fuck this up then are we?

03:08.462 --> 03:09.659
>> I have it under control.

03:09.694 --> 03:11.331
>> Hey, again, I

03:11.366 --> 03:14.158
just wanted to pop in and say
hi before we get started.

03:17.937 --> 03:19.438
Okay, all righty, um,

03:19.473 --> 03:22.067
looking forward to it
and see you out there.

03:25.512 --> 03:27.743
>> She's going to be trouble.

03:32.750 --> 03:36.884
Tense is never good.

03:36.919 --> 03:39.326
Never good.

03:39.361 --> 03:43.528
Smile. Act natural.

03:43.563 --> 03:46.190
Don't bring up the offer price,
and if she brings it up,

03:46.225 --> 03:47.928
just tell her
it's still being finalized.

03:47.963 --> 03:51.261
You can talk about India,
just no specifics.

03:51.296 --> 03:54.902
Clayton, don't fuck this up.

03:54.937 --> 03:56.937
They're watching.

03:58.776 --> 04:01.040
You know, you're my favorite.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.978
You know that,
always and forever.

04:09.314 --> 04:11.556
>> Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to Tech Weekly.

04:11.591 --> 04:13.525
I'm your host Anna Reid.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.725
Here with us today
is Clay Amani,

04:15.760 --> 04:19.223
the brilliant mind and
visionary behind Tempest Tech.

04:19.258 --> 04:21.060
Thanks for
coming in today, Clay.

04:22.329 --> 04:27.165
So Tempest has had the fastest
growth in the last 18 months.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.266
You must be proud?

04:29.972 --> 04:31.741
>> Yes, it's very exciting.

04:31.776 --> 04:33.380
We work very hard and

04:33.415 --> 04:35.943
we're very close to
achieving our goals.

04:35.978 --> 04:39.386
>> There seems to be a trend
with young tech entrepreneurs of

04:39.421 --> 04:41.586
promising the Moon and
pushing for aggressive growth

04:41.621 --> 04:45.183
in a short span
with minimal to show for it.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.823
Is that the case with Tempest?

04:47.858 --> 04:51.156
>> We've been able to manage
our growth conservatively.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.993
Yet effectively.

04:53.864 --> 04:55.666
>> What sets you apart?

04:59.265 --> 05:02.442
>> Well, our expansions
have been more timely,

05:02.477 --> 05:06.776
and we've been able to manage
our hires and our facilities

05:06.811 --> 05:09.416
to meet our requirements
and product output rather...

05:09.451 --> 05:12.177
>> Rather than showcase
nominal value.

05:16.821 --> 05:20.185
>> No, no, no.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.791
Not nominal,

05:21.826 --> 05:25.795
actual value with correct
figures to back the growth.

05:25.830 --> 05:27.830
>> Speaking of growth,

05:27.865 --> 05:29.997
there has been a ton of
speculation surrounding

05:30.032 --> 05:32.472
Tempest's expansion
and specifically,

05:32.507 --> 05:36.839
what are your strategic plans
for expanding into India?

05:37.675 --> 05:39.369
>> We feel our
expansion into India

05:39.404 --> 05:42.372
will provide opportunities
for us to grow

05:42.407 --> 05:44.484
while still allowing Tempest

05:44.519 --> 05:46.816
to bring better health care
systems to parts of the world

05:46.851 --> 05:49.016
that, obviously need it.

05:49.051 --> 05:53.053
>> Well, obviously it's also
a cost effective investment.

05:53.088 --> 05:55.121
Now would you say,
the lower offer price

05:55.156 --> 05:57.431
is a way to entice investors to

05:57.466 --> 05:59.466
overlook a depressed
last quarter.

06:02.262 --> 06:06.132
>> No, no, no,
not depressed,

06:06.167 --> 06:08.167
not depressed at all.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.401
Prices would decrease to garner
attention from investors

06:11.436 --> 06:14.712
willing to take a bet on
Tempest, long term.

06:14.747 --> 06:16.714
We're excited
about our technologies,

06:16.749 --> 06:19.519
product and growth.

06:19.554 --> 06:23.886
>> Prices weren't increased,
though, correct?

06:28.090 --> 06:30.497
How about this, sources, say

06:30.532 --> 06:35.095
that, Tempest's management is
undergoing massive change,

06:35.931 --> 06:39.330
specifically that your board
is looking to replace

06:39.365 --> 06:41.706
you as acting CEO.

06:42.544 --> 06:44.544
Is there any truth to that?

06:49.947 --> 06:52.211
We can skip to the next
question, if you'd like.

06:54.589 --> 06:56.281
Okay.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.557
Let's go back to...

06:57.592 --> 07:00.087
>> No more questions.

07:00.122 --> 07:01.924
Shut that off.

07:12.937 --> 07:14.508
>> Are you okay?

07:15.940 --> 07:17.973
Was I too much?

07:18.008 --> 07:20.580
I'm just, it's my job.

07:22.177 --> 07:23.583
>> You're trying to ruin me.

07:23.618 --> 07:25.376
>> I'm not trying to
do anything.

07:25.411 --> 07:28.313
>> You're trying to
make me look inept.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.558
You, succeeded.

07:31.593 --> 07:33.021
>> Clay.

07:33.958 --> 07:36.156
May I?

07:36.191 --> 07:38.565
You're talented.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.161
Everyone recognizes that.

07:41.830 --> 07:45.572
That brain of yours
is, incredible.

07:45.607 --> 07:47.739
It's extraordinary.

07:47.774 --> 07:53.613
Building software
and technology.

07:53.648 --> 07:56.374
What you went through
was tragic.

07:58.620 --> 08:02.589
But eventually, you'll set
yourself free otherwise.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.421
Good luck
with everything, Clay.

08:26.571 --> 08:28.846
>> Oh you sure handled that.

08:30.817 --> 08:35.248
That was the one time
you had to do it alone, Clayton.

08:35.617 --> 08:38.383
That was the one time

08:38.418 --> 08:41.386
that you needed to prove

08:41.421 --> 08:43.190
that you could
handle the stresses

08:43.225 --> 08:47.227
that come with being
a CEO of your own company.

08:48.063 --> 08:49.669
That you can handle
the tough questions,

08:49.704 --> 08:54.234
the scrutiny, that you could
handle your destiny

08:54.269 --> 08:57.270
and you failed.

08:57.639 --> 08:58.909
You failed.

09:00.682 --> 09:03.573
You'll always need me.

09:03.608 --> 09:07.445
>> No, I don't.

09:08.481 --> 09:12.824
>> Round and round
and round, you go,

09:12.859 --> 09:16.025
into the shadows,
Clayton must go.

09:16.060 --> 09:20.667
Round and round
and round you go.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.266
>> I can't do it.

09:26.701 --> 09:28.939
>> You don't need that
here, Clay.

09:35.145 --> 09:36.716
Thank you.

09:37.884 --> 09:40.280
What can't you do?

09:40.315 --> 09:42.315
>> Run, Tempest.

09:43.651 --> 09:47.617
I can't run Tempest.
>> Just stay with me
just for a moment, Clay.

09:52.393 --> 09:55.394
Clay. Sit down, please.

09:56.936 --> 09:59.167
Please Clay, sit down.

10:02.106 --> 10:03.567
Thank you.

10:04.306 --> 10:05.503
Now.

10:06.748 --> 10:08.638
Do you need to
run Tempest to be happy

10:08.673 --> 10:12.543
with what you've created?

10:12.578 --> 10:15.282
>> Tempest is all I have left.

10:15.317 --> 10:17.515
It's all that's been
keeping me going.

10:19.794 --> 10:24.390
>> Are you having
dark thoughts, Clay?

10:24.425 --> 10:25.490
>> No.

10:28.935 --> 10:32.398
>> We can't move forward and
deal with our present issues

10:32.433 --> 10:35.137
until we deal with our past.

10:35.172 --> 10:38.668
I think it's time
we deal with the traumas

10:38.703 --> 10:41.781
we talked about what
needed to happen eventually.

10:41.816 --> 10:43.541
And now it's time.

10:45.820 --> 10:49.613
It is time you
reconnect with them.

10:54.587 --> 10:58.391
You must and you will.

11:05.807 --> 11:08.566
Okay. Okay. Okay.

11:13.012 --> 11:17.245
Good. Now just
close your eyes.

11:18.853 --> 11:21.183
Allow yourself to relax.

11:40.875 --> 11:42.666
>> Clay Amani of Tempest Tech

11:42.701 --> 11:45.812
has gone off the grid
with little explanation.

11:45.847 --> 11:47.077
And so close to IPO,

11:47.112 --> 11:49.739
the company stands
on the verge of collapsing.

11:49.774 --> 11:51.741
His ability to operate and lead

11:51.776 --> 11:54.678
has come into question
for quite some time now.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.581
How will Tempest recover?

11:56.616 --> 11:58.825
Who will replace
the once revolutionary

11:58.860 --> 12:00.794
health care tech genius?

12:02.864 --> 12:06.591
>> Hello Anna, it's been
a really long time,

12:06.626 --> 12:08.868
and I just thought,
I would call,

12:08.903 --> 12:13.873
because, because I thought maybe

12:13.908 --> 12:17.701
I could take the family
back to India.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.892
>> Well, well, if it ain't
the tech genius himself.

12:32.927 --> 12:35.620
>> James. James.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.830
>> We see you got
your stut, stutter

12:36.865 --> 12:39.866
when you're nervous, huh.

12:39.901 --> 12:42.528
Still like physical
contact too right.

12:42.563 --> 12:45.432
Damn, you did good bro.
>> Yeah.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.467
>> You did real good.

12:48.303 --> 12:51.636
>> Hi, thanks for
having us, Clay.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.473
This place is beautiful.

12:54.674 --> 12:58.247
Blair baby, come say hi
to your, uncle.

12:58.282 --> 13:02.284
>> Hi. It's uh, nice to
see you again.

13:03.485 --> 13:06.860
>> Again, when did you see him?

13:06.895 --> 13:10.655
>> Oh, honey, he's a famous
tech guy on TV.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.096
>> Yeah.

13:12.131 --> 13:14.934
>> Oh, right, right.

13:15.970 --> 13:18.938
All right, well,
this is all, peachy.

13:18.973 --> 13:21.138
Can we go inside?

13:21.173 --> 13:22.700
>> Yes, yes.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.878
Why don't I show you to
rooms and get you settled?

13:24.913 --> 13:26.704
>> Um-hmm!

13:26.739 --> 13:28.948
James, come and grab
our shit.

13:28.983 --> 13:30.477
>> No, no, no, that's okay.

13:30.512 --> 13:32.776
The housekeepers will be
able to bring you bags

13:32.811 --> 13:33.843
up to your rooms for you.

13:33.878 --> 13:35.086
>> Housekeepers.

13:35.121 --> 13:37.924
That's uh, that's what I wanted,

13:37.959 --> 13:39.288
I like that, I like that a lot.

13:39.323 --> 13:41.521
You got uh, you got to
have a few of those.

13:41.556 --> 13:44.359
>> James, you're so annoying,
let's go Blair.

13:46.792 --> 13:47.791
>> You good?

14:12.191 --> 14:15.159
>> This, this is
the living room?

14:15.194 --> 14:16.721
>> Yeah, no shit.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.526
>> This place looks old.

14:19.561 --> 14:22.100
>> It is, it was built
in the 20s.

14:22.135 --> 14:23.937
>> Furniture's from the 20s too?

14:23.972 --> 14:26.731
>> Some, yes.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.370
>> Antiques.

14:29.241 --> 14:30.735
>> That's right.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.803
>> Yeah, you got any booze?

14:32.838 --> 14:34.838
>> Yes.
>> Really. So soon.

14:38.019 --> 14:42.747
>> Here's the bar, it's full,
so please help yourself.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.816
>> Antique bar to go with
antique furniture

14:45.851 --> 14:50.623
and an antique house,
it's amazing.

14:55.696 --> 14:57.465
>> No don't.

14:59.403 --> 15:01.832
There's a bottle opener
in the drawer James?

15:01.867 --> 15:04.406
>> There's no need bro,
I'm simple.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.376
>> Whoops!
>> No, no, no.

15:07.411 --> 15:09.048
>> Guys.

15:09.083 --> 15:12.843
>> Please be careful
because this rug...

15:12.878 --> 15:15.582
>> It's antique.

15:15.617 --> 15:16.814
>> Yes.

15:18.455 --> 15:20.158
That's the kitchen.

15:20.193 --> 15:22.226
>> Let me guess,
let me guess, umm,

15:22.261 --> 15:24.393
personal chef.

15:24.428 --> 15:28.793
>> No, but there's lots of food

15:28.828 --> 15:31.400
and you can help yourself.
>> Thank you.

15:31.435 --> 15:33.963
>> You have housekeepers,
but no chef.

15:33.998 --> 15:37.274
Okay, I got to teach you how to
run a mother fuckin mansion.
>> James. Shut up man.

15:37.309 --> 15:38.869
>> What?

15:38.904 --> 15:40.640
We're bonding.

15:40.675 --> 15:41.806
>> Uh.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.841
I'll, I'll show you
to your rooms.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.893
This is your room.

16:06.140 --> 16:09.075
>> Check out the lighting.

16:09.110 --> 16:11.308
It's just like the club, huh.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.907
>> This one's yours, James.

16:19.483 --> 16:22.715
>> Money for the money, man.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.321
Well I dig it.

16:24.356 --> 16:25.454
>> Hmm.

16:25.489 --> 16:27.126
>> Yeah, we'll work on that.

16:27.161 --> 16:28.523
Yeah, when did
the housekeepers bring this up?

16:28.558 --> 16:31.460
I didn't see no one.

16:31.495 --> 16:33.264
Stealth employees, I like it.

16:33.299 --> 16:35.464
>> No, no, no, no,
no shoes on the bed.

16:35.499 --> 16:39.105
Take them off bro.
>> Just chill.

16:39.140 --> 16:44.539
Oh, this feels good.

16:44.574 --> 16:49.874
>> This one's yours.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.876
>> Wow.

16:51.911 --> 16:52.910
Oh, this is beautiful.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.683
>> This isn't yours.

16:56.718 --> 16:59.686
>> Don't worry kid, won't make
too much noise, all right.

16:59.721 --> 17:01.721
>> No, please.

17:02.190 --> 17:03.987
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

17:05.199 --> 17:09.168
My house, my rules,
everybody gets their own rooms.

17:09.203 --> 17:13.997
>> Hey, that's, that's cool,
that's cool, right?

17:14.032 --> 17:15.339
>> Yeah, sure.

17:30.224 --> 17:32.587
>> Dinner will be at- 00 p.m..

17:32.622 --> 17:34.556
Please don't be late.

17:34.591 --> 17:36.954
>> What's upstairs?

17:36.989 --> 17:38.362
>> It's off limits.

17:38.397 --> 17:40.958
>> What else
is off limits, hotshot?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.368
>> Housekeepers
live on the estate

17:44.403 --> 17:47.404
and they prefer their privacy.

17:52.444 --> 17:55.214
Okay. We'll see you at dinner.

17:55.249 --> 17:57.040
Please don't be late.

18:02.652 --> 18:04.982
- 00 p.m.

18:10.429 --> 18:11.956
>> Why?

18:17.799 --> 18:20.602
My house, my rules, Benny.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.218
>> How joyful.

18:32.253 --> 18:34.649
Family reunions Clayton,

18:34.684 --> 18:37.685
are always just joyful.

18:39.183 --> 18:42.690
Clarissa's still very easy to
look at, isn't she?

18:45.629 --> 18:49.092
We're still fond of your
brother's wife, aren't we?

18:52.933 --> 18:55.164
Nothing like a little
incestuous reunion.

18:55.199 --> 18:57.441
Just spice things up.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.413
I want it noted
that I don't think

19:02.448 --> 19:06.010
this is going to pan out
exactly the way you think

19:06.045 --> 19:08.045
it's going to happen.

19:09.653 --> 19:11.147
>> Noted.

19:14.856 --> 19:17.186
>> Very well then sire,

19:17.221 --> 19:19.463
you're in control now.

20:00.341 --> 20:01.274
>> Hello.

20:04.268 --> 20:07.478
Sorry, hope
I didn't scare you.

20:07.513 --> 20:09.513
What have you got there?

20:10.516 --> 20:13.319
Oh, it's a magpie.

20:13.354 --> 20:16.080
One means sorrow.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.324
It's a superstition.

20:18.359 --> 20:21.327
May, may I?

20:21.362 --> 20:26.123
Here little guy, here little guy
it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

20:30.734 --> 20:32.734
You need to set him free.

20:57.596 --> 21:01.290
♪ You made me
you trust me ♪

21:01.325 --> 21:05.195
♪ It's all over the country ♪

21:05.230 --> 21:09.133
♪ Of taking matters
to join me ♪

21:09.168 --> 21:11.377
♪ I'm having none of that
dispel me♪

21:17.418 --> 21:19.418
>> You're the fuckin wolf.

21:19.453 --> 21:21.145
Yeah that's right baby

21:21.180 --> 21:24.181
you're the motherfucking wolf.

21:25.426 --> 21:27.393
You're going to
get what's yours.

21:29.430 --> 21:30.363
Tonight.

21:31.256 --> 21:32.827
So are you.

21:50.484 --> 21:52.484
>> What are you doing?

21:56.380 --> 22:00.624
>> We're going to take a shower,
but it's taken.

22:02.463 --> 22:03.858
>> Dinner's almost ready, James.

22:03.893 --> 22:05.893
>> Yeah, I'll be right there.

22:19.909 --> 22:22.613
>> I think I got a business
proposition for you.

22:22.648 --> 22:26.881
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, I think it's time
that you diversify a bit.

22:26.916 --> 22:29.213
Maybe we become partners.

22:30.722 --> 22:32.458
>> In what?

22:32.493 --> 22:34.625
>> The club, obviously.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.858
>> Oh obviously.

22:36.893 --> 22:39.025
>> Look, man, I'm serious,
I'm looking to expand,

22:39.060 --> 22:40.466
and I know you do
a little bit of this

22:40.501 --> 22:41.665
and a little bit of that.

22:41.700 --> 22:45.295
>> Wow, Clay, this looks
absolutely amazing.

22:45.330 --> 22:46.505
Oh.

22:46.540 --> 22:48.474
>> Who made all this?

22:48.509 --> 22:50.476
>> My chef.

22:50.511 --> 22:52.137
>> I thought you said
you didn't actually,

22:52.172 --> 22:54.513
actually let me guess, umm.

22:54.548 --> 22:58.044
You hired one
because I'm a genius.

22:58.079 --> 23:00.079
See, we make great partners.

23:00.114 --> 23:01.718
James, I honestly think
you get dumber

23:01.753 --> 23:03.049
by the minute, dude.

23:03.084 --> 23:06.250
>> Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.527
>> So we good.
>> Mm-Hmm. Yes.

23:08.562 --> 23:10.661
>> I'm starved.
Lets have a leg.

23:10.696 --> 23:13.664
>> Wait, wait, could
you start with the salad.

23:13.699 --> 23:14.929
Salad first.

23:14.964 --> 23:18.504
>> Okay. Yeah, okay..

23:18.539 --> 23:19.901
>> Yeah, I don't eat salad.

23:19.936 --> 23:21.540
>> You can use
some veggies, bro.

23:21.575 --> 23:23.267
>> What does that
even mean, man?

23:23.302 --> 23:25.907
>> Just please
shut up, man. All right.

23:26.943 --> 23:28.338
>> Here you go.
>> I'm just saying.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.549
>> You got it.

23:30.584 --> 23:32.375
>> Well, there's a carrot.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.114
>> Why did you
stop eating meat?

23:37.591 --> 23:40.086
>> I never liked meat Benny.

23:40.121 --> 23:41.692
>> What are you talking about?

23:41.727 --> 23:44.156
We ate meat our whole lives.

23:44.191 --> 23:47.533
>> We were forced to eat meat
our whole lives, James

23:47.568 --> 23:50.503
But I didn't like it.

23:50.538 --> 23:52.329
>> Why didn't you
just say something?

24:02.506 --> 24:06.783
>> Well you've, you've done
good for yourself, Clay.

24:06.818 --> 24:08.719
I never really
thought you'd make it.

24:08.754 --> 24:13.119
Never mind,
never mind all this.

24:13.154 --> 24:16.628
>> Rags to riches
like, literally.

24:17.464 --> 24:20.159
Speaking of which, back to my
proposition about the clubs.

24:20.194 --> 24:24.603
>> James, shut the fuck up about
your business ventures, man.

24:24.638 --> 24:29.938
No one's going to invest in a,
in a chunky club rat.

24:29.973 --> 24:32.171
>> Fuck you, man.

24:32.206 --> 24:33.777
I'm a legitimate businessman.

24:33.812 --> 24:36.780
I am.

24:36.815 --> 24:39.618
>> Hm-Mmm.
>> Fuck all you guys.

24:39.653 --> 24:41.587
>> What I was getting at

24:41.622 --> 24:44.953
what I was getting at
is this kid

24:44.988 --> 24:47.791
couldn't keep himself
from wetting his own bed.

24:47.826 --> 24:51.388
Now he's the owner of a,
of a giant company.

24:57.869 --> 25:02.399
>> So I hear you might lose
your job in your own company.

25:03.006 --> 25:04.038
How does that work?

25:04.073 --> 25:05.611
>> Can I please go to my room?

25:05.646 --> 25:06.777
>> Yes.
>> No.

25:06.812 --> 25:08.779
>> Benny.
>> I said no.

25:10.013 --> 25:12.013
Honey finish your food.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.379
>> Okay.

25:16.316 --> 25:17.854
>> Is that true?

25:19.583 --> 25:22.056
>> Losing your marbles, bro?

25:22.091 --> 25:23.552
Whatever's left of them.

25:23.587 --> 25:27.391
>> Please um, I don't want to
talk about work.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.295
Why, why don't we have dessert?

25:30.330 --> 25:32.396
>> Mommy, I don't really
feel like dessert.

25:32.431 --> 25:35.003
>> Yes. Yes, you do, honey.

25:35.038 --> 25:38.039
>> Dad.

25:38.074 --> 25:41.240
>> She doesn't have to
have dessert.

25:41.275 --> 25:43.440
>> What did you say?

25:43.475 --> 25:45.211
>> I'm sorry.

25:45.246 --> 25:48.852
>> She's not
your daughter, Clay.

25:48.887 --> 25:50.887
Honey,

25:50.922 --> 25:53.659
why don't you have
some of the cake,

25:53.694 --> 25:57.487
you're incredible,
super smart,

25:57.522 --> 26:01.029
super giving uncle
made for you, okay.

26:01.064 --> 26:07.706
>> Okay.

26:07.741 --> 26:09.466
>> Why are we here bro?

26:13.637 --> 26:17.474
We don't see you for what
ten years maybe?

26:18.642 --> 26:20.609
James, you've seen him.

26:20.644 --> 26:23.447
James hasn't seen you.

26:23.482 --> 26:25.691
I haven't seen you.

26:25.726 --> 26:27.451
They haven't seen you.

26:28.762 --> 26:30.729
Not a call.

26:30.764 --> 26:32.522
Not a visit.

26:33.658 --> 26:40.068
Not even help bailing me out
when I needed it the most.

26:40.103 --> 26:42.301
So why are we here Clay?

26:43.370 --> 26:44.941
Why now?

26:49.981 --> 26:52.641
Am I too dumb for you, Clay?

26:52.676 --> 26:53.917
Hm-mmh.
>> No.

26:53.952 --> 26:57.690
>> Not worth responding.

26:57.725 --> 27:00.990
>> I just want to
spend some time together.

27:01.692 --> 27:06.094
Have, be a family,
you know, like,

27:06.129 --> 27:07.293
you know, move past all of this.

27:07.328 --> 27:10.131
>> Move pass what exactly?

27:11.365 --> 27:13.662
The fact that you abandoned us.

27:13.697 --> 27:15.136
>> I didn't.

27:15.171 --> 27:18.502
>> You think I forgot that
you abandoned us Clay.

27:23.344 --> 27:24.915
Is it fucking with your,

27:24.950 --> 27:28.952
with your techie zen bullshit,
is that it, bro, hmm?

27:31.792 --> 27:36.553
Or maybe, just maybe
you're going a little, you know?

27:38.557 --> 27:42.229
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

27:42.731 --> 27:46.233
A little cuckoo, hmm.

27:47.632 --> 27:49.632
Please, please.

27:58.643 --> 28:00.412
>> I'm sorry.

28:05.859 --> 28:09.718
Thank you for a lovely evening.

28:09.753 --> 28:11.258
Goodnight.

28:14.835 --> 28:16.164
>> Can I please be excused?

28:16.199 --> 28:18.661
>> Yes. Yes, of course, baby.

28:27.672 --> 28:30.211
>> So we're doing shots?
>> Yes.

28:47.296 --> 28:49.395
>> inhale, exhale.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.232
Where are we Clay?

28:53.302 --> 28:55.302
Breathe, where are we?

29:01.640 --> 29:06.115
>> Round, round and round
and round you go.

29:09.087 --> 29:12.682
Round and round
and round and round.

29:12.717 --> 29:14.992
You will always need me Clay

29:15.027 --> 29:19.260
you will always live in
other people's shadows.

29:20.263 --> 29:24.837
You need to deal with
your problems like a man.

29:28.909 --> 29:31.877
Your company is plummeting.

29:31.912 --> 29:35.078
And yes, always
you are incapable

29:35.113 --> 29:37.278
of doing anything about it.

29:37.313 --> 29:41.249
And I'll step in
to save the day and I will.

29:41.284 --> 29:43.647
Because you're my favourite.

29:43.682 --> 29:46.155
Always, my favourite.

29:47.752 --> 29:50.456
I am a man.

29:50.491 --> 29:53.690
and I don't
need your help anymore.

29:56.530 --> 29:59.663
>> Whose help don't you
need anymore Clay?

30:01.700 --> 30:04.877
>> I'm doing the best I can.

30:04.912 --> 30:08.738
>> Well, your best is as always,
nowhere near good enough.

30:08.773 --> 30:10.344
>> What's happening Clay?

30:12.810 --> 30:14.579
>> I'm telling you,
I'm telling you.
>> I know.

30:14.614 --> 30:16.922
>> This kid's losing his shit.
>> No.

30:16.957 --> 30:19.287
Any day now.

30:19.322 --> 30:21.289
>> Hopefully we're in his will.

30:21.324 --> 30:22.752
>> Okay, really, really.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.490
Is James thinking about others?

30:24.525 --> 30:26.129
>> I better be in that will.

30:26.164 --> 30:27.691
I didn't come up here
for nothing.

30:28.826 --> 30:32.597
>> Aah. I'm going to
go take a piss.

30:32.632 --> 30:36.403
If I can find a bathroom
in this shithole.

30:38.143 --> 30:39.373
>> Hurry back.
>> No problem.

30:39.408 --> 30:40.704
>> Thank you.

30:46.987 --> 30:47.920
Aah.

30:50.188 --> 30:54.322
>> So how have you been?
>>Really.

30:54.357 --> 30:57.556
>> Come on.
It'll be fun.

30:58.856 --> 31:00.163
Just one.

31:01.001 --> 31:03.199
>> Just once.

31:03.234 --> 31:06.334
Oh, well, you feel
me on top of you.

31:06.369 --> 31:07.797
You want to feel my tongue?

31:07.832 --> 31:09.975
>> Yeah.

31:10.010 --> 31:12.142
>> Are you my wolf?
>> Oh yeah.

31:12.177 --> 31:15.739
>> Are you my big,
bad fucking wolf?
>> Yeah, baby.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.840
>> Oh, you want to howl for me?
>> Yeah.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.545
>> How bad?
>> Really bad.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.779
>> Keep dreaming.
Get the fuck away from me.

31:28.391 --> 31:30.996
Well, I think I've had
enough for tonight.

31:31.031 --> 31:32.261
I'm a...

31:34.265 --> 31:36.859
I'm going to head upstairs.

31:36.894 --> 31:39.664
Would you like to join me?
>> Mm-hmm.

31:39.699 --> 31:41.765
>> Goodnight James.

31:45.804 --> 31:46.770
>> What?

31:48.873 --> 31:50.642
>> I didn't say anything.

32:15.273 --> 32:16.833
>> Fuck.

32:18.672 --> 32:20.738
Fucking bullshit.

32:24.051 --> 32:26.282
>> There's something
weird about all this shit.

32:27.450 --> 32:29.285
>> He's always been odd, okay.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.616
You of all people know this.

32:30.651 --> 32:34.257
Yeah, but not like this.
Never like this.

32:37.064 --> 32:39.328
>> He probably has
cancer or something.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.662
>> I don't know, I'm just
getting a bad vibe somehow.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.962
I just don't know
why we're here.

32:49.109 --> 32:50.834
>> Hey, babe. Hey.

32:53.938 --> 32:55.113
Fuck.

32:55.148 --> 32:57.676
>> You haven't seen him
in a long time.

32:59.548 --> 33:00.877
He's always been
good to us though.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.648
>> Yeah, yeah.

33:02.683 --> 33:05.255
The little creep has
always been good to you.

33:05.290 --> 33:07.917
He's never been good to us.

33:07.952 --> 33:09.853
>> Hello.

33:09.888 --> 33:12.493
>> He's acted like,
like I never existed,

33:12.528 --> 33:14.528
the minute he left for college.

33:14.563 --> 33:16.662
>> Benny you never
made it easy for him.

33:16.697 --> 33:17.927
>> What is that
supposed to mean?

33:17.962 --> 33:19.137
>> You know what it means?

33:19.172 --> 33:21.766
He was your
literal punching bag.

33:21.801 --> 33:23.339
>> He had it easy.

33:25.277 --> 33:26.936
Not me.

33:26.971 --> 33:28.509
And not, James.

33:30.150 --> 33:33.349
We took the beatings
every time he fucked up.

33:34.715 --> 33:37.716
We got licked,
fucking literally, always,

33:37.751 --> 33:40.488
so that Clay
could learn a lesson.

33:40.523 --> 33:42.985
And why, hmm?

33:44.395 --> 33:47.693
Why, what did he have
that we didn't?

33:47.728 --> 33:49.926
That I deserved...
>> Okay.

33:52.535 --> 33:58.506
>> Baby you're so, so special.

33:58.541 --> 34:00.541
You're my favourite.

34:18.330 --> 34:20.363
>> Housekeepers?

34:28.967 --> 34:30.571
No, no, I'm coming.

34:33.642 --> 34:35.444
Fuck me.

35:49.487 --> 35:51.454
>> Good morning.

35:51.489 --> 35:53.720
>> Oh, good morning.

35:59.222 --> 36:01.057
You're up early.

36:22.487 --> 36:25.257
>> Is that true
what Benny said last night?

36:28.559 --> 36:30.086
>> About what?

36:32.156 --> 36:33.727
>> Are you going crazy?

36:33.762 --> 36:38.226
>> Oh, no.

36:38.261 --> 36:40.965
I don't think so.

36:45.774 --> 36:47.741
>> Are you sick?

36:47.776 --> 36:49.105
>> No.

36:52.517 --> 36:55.485
Well. Maybe.

37:02.153 --> 37:03.251
Just joking.

37:03.286 --> 37:06.562
>> Oh, good joke.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.937
>> Do you read a lot?

37:19.775 --> 37:21.775
>> Yeah, I find it soothing.

37:22.976 --> 37:24.976
>> You and I both.

37:27.310 --> 37:30.179
>> Astrology,
>> Sorry.

37:30.214 --> 37:32.522
>> It's on astrology.
>> Hm-mmh!

37:32.557 --> 37:35.184
>> Our birthdays give us
our meaning to life.

37:35.219 --> 37:37.758
Sometimes our purpose
in life too.

37:40.763 --> 37:44.732
>> So what's the meaning
to your life?

37:44.767 --> 37:47.735
>> Well, I'm born April 7th,

37:47.770 --> 37:49.935
which makes me an Aries.

37:49.970 --> 37:51.970
So that means uh.

37:55.811 --> 37:57.239
I don't actually
believe in this shit,

37:57.274 --> 38:01.177
I just find it interesting.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.783
>> You're funny.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.790
>> Do you know what
the meaning to your life is?

38:18.438 --> 38:21.406
Are you at least
happy with your life?

38:26.369 --> 38:30.206
>> I, don't know.

38:33.849 --> 38:35.849
>> Me neither.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.822
>> What would you change?

38:46.466 --> 38:47.894
>> Love.

38:49.865 --> 38:51.194
>> Love.

38:53.473 --> 38:56.034
>> I wish I had parents
that loved me.

39:01.679 --> 39:03.679
>> They do.

39:06.046 --> 39:08.486
>> They're not parents.

39:08.521 --> 39:11.214
Parents protect their kids.

39:11.249 --> 39:14.052
Or actually take care of them.

39:14.087 --> 39:17.858
Take them to after school
programs, events.

39:17.893 --> 39:20.630
And teach them things.

39:20.665 --> 39:22.830
Mine are just

39:22.865 --> 39:24.865
adult kids.

39:27.507 --> 39:29.474
>> What are
you two nerds, doing?

39:29.509 --> 39:31.234
>> Good morning.

39:33.876 --> 39:36.679
Hey, have you guys,
have you guys seen James?

39:36.714 --> 39:40.045
>> Ah knowing Jay he's probably
passed out under a tree?

39:40.080 --> 39:42.685
>> I mean,
you're probably right.

39:47.384 --> 39:50.253
Hey, Clay,
do you have rackets?

39:50.288 --> 39:51.859
>> I ain't playing tennis.

39:51.894 --> 39:53.355
>> Yes, you are.
>> Uh-uh.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.664
>> Yes, you are.
>> No.

39:54.699 --> 39:57.469
>> Come on, please,
please, please, please.

40:00.199 --> 40:02.540
Blair baby,
we're playing tennis.

40:02.575 --> 40:03.431
I am.
>> Okay.

40:03.466 --> 40:05.070
>> And please keep it that way.

40:05.105 --> 40:07.303
>> Yeah you too.
You're dead anyway.

40:18.118 --> 40:21.086
>> Aren't you, uh cold?

40:21.121 --> 40:23.352
>> No.

40:26.929 --> 40:29.567
What were you guys
talking about?

40:29.602 --> 40:30.700
>> Who?

40:30.735 --> 40:33.164
>> You and Clay.

40:33.199 --> 40:35.771
>> Oh, books.

40:36.573 --> 40:40.204
>> Ah. You guys
got that in common, huh?

40:40.239 --> 40:42.206
>> Yeah, I guess.

40:47.620 --> 40:51.380
>> Do you have any book
recommendations for me?

40:53.417 --> 40:54.724
>> What?
>> No.

40:54.759 --> 40:56.561
>> You know, your dad
can read, right?

40:56.596 --> 40:59.597
>> I don't have any
recommendations.

40:59.632 --> 41:03.601
>> I'm just saying we can,
maybe we can do uh,

41:03.636 --> 41:07.396
you know, like a,
like a dad daughter,

41:08.399 --> 41:12.203
like a, like a father
daughter, kind of,

41:13.646 --> 41:16.647
you know, like a
mutual hobby kind of thing.

41:21.984 --> 41:23.984
Yeah, that's not
really my thing, huh.

41:27.055 --> 41:28.857
>> Come on.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.010
>> Hello.

41:51.618 --> 41:55.279
James, I swear to God,
if you were just.

41:55.314 --> 41:58.546
Clay you scared,
the shit out of me.

41:58.581 --> 42:01.054
>> I'm, I'm sorry.

42:01.089 --> 42:04.189
Oh, I got this one for you.

42:04.224 --> 42:05.696
>> Thank you.

42:07.227 --> 42:08.490
>> What?

42:10.835 --> 42:12.802
>> We really missed you.

42:21.439 --> 42:24.781
>> I missed you guys a lot,
and I should've been there.

42:24.816 --> 42:28.686
I just I can't, I can't.
>> Clay, It's okay.

42:28.721 --> 42:32.481
Just forget it.
Don't worry.

42:38.830 --> 42:41.094
>> You got to
warm up first, okay.
>> Okay.

42:41.129 --> 42:42.425
>> There you go.

42:42.460 --> 42:45.329
Yeah. Get those
knees up, up, up.

42:45.364 --> 42:47.331
Get your cardio up hon.

42:48.873 --> 42:52.039
You know,
I used to play a little.

42:52.074 --> 42:54.679
>> Oh, okay.
>> I was really good.

42:54.714 --> 42:57.473
Ready. Watch out
it's going to be fast.

43:06.693 --> 43:08.154
That was good, right?

43:15.900 --> 43:19.363
>> Dad, dad, dad, are you okay?
>> Aah.

43:20.597 --> 43:23.598
>> Sorry, sorry.
>> Don't yell.

43:24.304 --> 43:25.677
I'm fine.

43:25.712 --> 43:27.305
>> I won't do that again.

43:30.112 --> 43:32.277
>> Shall we start?

43:32.312 --> 43:34.147
>> What, what are the teams?

43:34.182 --> 43:35.720
>> You're on my team.

43:35.755 --> 43:37.887
>> Where do I go, here?

43:37.922 --> 43:39.152
>> Yeah.

43:42.421 --> 43:45.587
>> Oh.
>> Here you go.

43:45.622 --> 43:48.931
>> Oh, hehehe. Yes.
>> See.

43:50.627 --> 43:52.627
>> Sorry. My ball.
>> Okay.

43:53.429 --> 43:55.971
>> Nice and low, nice and low.
>> Okay.

43:58.536 --> 44:01.339
>> Um, shhh. Sorry.
>> Bend your knees.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.178
It's okay.

44:11.582 --> 44:14.121
There you go.
>> Aah.

44:14.156 --> 44:16.156
>> Hehehe, yes.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.359
>> It's two for them.
>> Sorry, sorry.

44:32.779 --> 44:34.746
>> There you go. Yes.

44:35.573 --> 44:38.816
>> A winner, yes.

44:41.216 --> 44:42.952
>> Fuck you, that was in.

44:42.987 --> 44:45.383
>> Benny, sometimes
you win, sometimes you lose.

44:45.418 --> 44:49.156
>> That was in.
>> Benny. Come on.

44:49.191 --> 44:51.422
>> Dude, that was in.

44:59.762 --> 45:01.267
>> Benny.

45:02.270 --> 45:03.841
Really?

45:03.876 --> 45:06.635
>> You're a cheating a little
scrawny, fuck, you know that.

45:06.670 --> 45:07.669
>> Benny, come on.

45:07.704 --> 45:09.737
>> No, fuck this.

45:09.772 --> 45:11.244
>> Benny.

45:11.884 --> 45:13.884
No, no, no. Benny stop.

45:16.284 --> 45:19.021
>> Stay the fuck away
from my girl, you creep.

45:19.056 --> 45:20.649
You didn't think I knew
you were seeing her

45:20.684 --> 45:21.991
when I was on the inside.

45:22.026 --> 45:23.586
>> Benny. Huh?

45:30.430 --> 45:31.660
>> Don't.

46:07.907 --> 46:11.667
>> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:15.838 --> 46:21.809
What to do, what to do
what to do?

46:21.844 --> 46:24.647
I was only playing,

46:24.682 --> 46:26.814
I just, I was just trying to
play tennis.

46:26.849 --> 46:29.091
I was just trying to
play tennis.

46:30.930 --> 46:32.358
I'm sorry.

48:03.781 --> 48:04.747
>> I'm sorry,

48:05.618 --> 48:06.848
I'm sorry.

48:06.883 --> 48:09.422
>> Round and round
and round you go.

48:09.457 --> 48:12.458
Beyond the shadows
you must go.

48:20.963 --> 48:23.975
Round and round
and round and round.

48:47.495 --> 48:48.791
>> What is this?

49:37.116 --> 49:40.678
>> Tell me what's happening.

49:40.713 --> 49:42.911
>> Please just stop it,
stop, stop.

49:42.946 --> 49:46.123
>> Clay, just breathe.
>> Stop it.

49:46.158 --> 49:48.092
>> Where are we Clay?

49:48.127 --> 49:50.017
>> Why does he always hurt me?

49:50.052 --> 49:51.689
>> Who's hurting you?

49:51.724 --> 49:54.065
>> It was my brother.

49:54.100 --> 49:55.099
>> Why does he hate me?

49:55.134 --> 49:57.662
>> You need to
let him go, Clay.

49:57.697 --> 49:59.301
You need to set him free.

49:59.336 --> 50:02.337
>> When will we stop this Clay?

50:11.975 --> 50:15.251
You can't be fixed.

50:15.286 --> 50:19.255
You shake, you, you tremble

50:19.290 --> 50:20.553
you can't be fixed.

50:20.588 --> 50:23.490
You, you left me alone.
>> No.

50:23.525 --> 50:24.689
>> You ran away.

50:24.724 --> 50:27.527
You abandoned
the family Clayton.

50:29.927 --> 50:34.171
>> She can't help you,
but I can.

50:34.206 --> 50:37.207
>> Could you?
>> Please.

50:38.606 --> 50:42.971
Please what,
please what?

50:43.006 --> 50:46.513
You're so weak,
so pathetic.

50:46.548 --> 50:50.011
>> It's okay Clay,
Clay I got you.

50:52.158 --> 50:56.127
Just breathe.
Tell me what's happening.

50:56.162 --> 50:58.954
Clay, stay right here.

51:17.216 --> 51:18.974
>> Rough day.

51:21.044 --> 51:24.386
>> And who are you
supposed to be?

51:24.421 --> 51:26.388
>> Denver Kane.

51:26.423 --> 51:29.193
>> And when did you get here
Mr. Kane?

51:29.228 --> 51:32.163
>> Denver please.
>> Right.

51:32.198 --> 51:35.430
>> May I?
>> Please.

51:43.242 --> 51:47.772
>> It's such a weak
man's characteristic to

51:47.807 --> 51:50.577
actually strike a woman,

51:50.612 --> 51:53.844
such a beautiful way
to mock you.

51:54.813 --> 51:57.815
>> And you're, you're what,
you're a strongman.

52:05.660 --> 52:09.431
>> A truly strong man.

52:09.466 --> 52:15.371
Who knows exactly what to do
with his hands for a woman.

52:15.406 --> 52:17.406
>> Is that right?

52:17.441 --> 52:20.838
>> Yes.
>> Hmm!

52:20.873 --> 52:23.005
How so?

52:23.040 --> 52:24.380
>> Depends.

52:24.415 --> 52:29.220
It really does, depend.

52:30.487 --> 52:33.719
>> And it depends on what?

52:53.906 --> 52:55.906
Oh, yes.

53:08.921 --> 53:10.921
What the heck?

53:18.304 --> 53:21.305
>> Round and round and
round and round

53:21.340 --> 53:25.672
and round and round and round

53:25.707 --> 53:28.873
round and round, round.

53:28.908 --> 53:30.479
>> James.

53:57.574 --> 54:02.137
>> Round and round
and round and round and round.

54:04.581 --> 54:06.108
>> James.

54:50.187 --> 54:51.956
>> Really, he's doing
much better.

54:51.991 --> 54:53.221
>> Oh, that's good news.

54:53.256 --> 54:55.223
>> However, the damage to
the frontal lobe,

54:55.258 --> 54:56.994
that's going to be challenging.

54:57.029 --> 54:58.259
>> Okay.

54:58.294 --> 55:00.404
You've said he's doing
better though, correct?

55:00.439 --> 55:02.571
>> Well, we won't know the
full extent of his mental state

55:02.606 --> 55:04.232
until he's recovered from
the current state

55:04.267 --> 55:05.772
that he's in right now.

55:05.807 --> 55:07.972
His motor controls are
completely diminished,

55:08.007 --> 55:10.480
except for some
sensory feelings.

55:11.373 --> 55:12.977
>> So when can
I take him home?

55:13.012 --> 55:16.079
>> We'll have to take that day
by day as the court ordered.

55:16.114 --> 55:17.212
He's still a threat to
his own life

55:17.247 --> 55:19.819
and perhaps those around him,

55:19.854 --> 55:21.656
>> He can't move,
how can he be violent?

55:21.691 --> 55:24.659
>> I know this is difficult
for you, sweetheart,

55:24.694 --> 55:26.463
but until I can assess
his mental state,

55:26.498 --> 55:28.861
I cannot advise
that he'd be released.

55:28.896 --> 55:30.698
Okay, please understand.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.438
Now your visits are very good
for him and I'd recommend

55:34.473 --> 55:37.804
you continue to see him
as much as possible, okay.

55:37.839 --> 55:39.839
>> Of course.
>> Okay.

55:49.488 --> 55:51.246
Hey, baby.

55:58.629 --> 56:00.057
We need to get you a haircut.

56:04.701 --> 56:06.701
Maybe also a beard trim.

56:08.100 --> 56:10.672
You are looking
rather distinguished.

56:12.940 --> 56:15.237
Sorry Blair couldn't be here.

56:17.681 --> 56:21.243
She is on her way to
her future mother in laws.

56:23.115 --> 56:25.115
For a wedding outfitting.

56:29.528 --> 56:31.957
So strange that she's
getting married so soon.

56:42.970 --> 56:44.772
Can you hear me?

56:48.580 --> 56:51.339
Please, please, just say
something baby.

57:00.559 --> 57:02.284
>> Sorry, to interrupt ma'am.

57:03.562 --> 57:04.286
>> Oh.

57:10.701 --> 57:12.294
I got to get going anyway.

57:43.998 --> 57:48.363
>> I wonder what's going through
that head of yours?

57:48.398 --> 57:52.136
Honestly, I can't imagine

57:52.171 --> 57:54.743
what it'd be like to be
trapped in my own mind.

57:55.779 --> 58:00.210
Not being able to move or
control anything in my life.

58:03.820 --> 58:05.787
Do I bother you,
Mr. Amani?

58:07.450 --> 58:11.221
You don't like me washing
your balls and your armpits?

58:13.192 --> 58:16.523
Maybe too much.

58:16.558 --> 58:19.031
Fuck you.

58:19.666 --> 58:22.573
I mean, do you think I
want to fucking be here.

58:22.608 --> 58:26.368
I mean, you, it's your
own fault that you're here.

58:28.504 --> 58:30.273
You're weak.

58:32.013 --> 58:33.782
You know what?

58:35.082 --> 58:39.623
Immobile patients
drown, all the time.

58:40.626 --> 58:42.659
Accidents happen, right?

58:44.025 --> 58:46.289
And come,
come to think of it,

58:46.324 --> 58:49.457
you were in
an accident, right, Clay?

58:49.492 --> 58:52.031
That's how you
ended up adopted.

58:55.465 --> 58:58.840
That brain of yours
is incredible.

58:59.469 --> 59:02.008
It's extraordinary even.

59:02.043 --> 59:04.472
Building software technology.

59:05.541 --> 59:07.882
But now,

59:07.917 --> 59:10.687
round and round, you go

59:10.722 --> 59:14.416
into the shadows,
you will go.

59:17.696 --> 59:19.894
Hey, hey.

59:19.929 --> 59:22.930
It's okay, it's okay.

59:24.329 --> 59:26.329
It'll be quick.

59:26.364 --> 59:29.596
I know, I know,
you don't want to go, I know.

59:29.631 --> 59:32.434
It's time for you to go.

59:32.469 --> 59:34.469
I'm going to set you free.

59:54.733 --> 59:55.622
What did you do?

59:55.657 --> 59:57.668
What did you do?
What did you do?

1:00:20.759 --> 1:00:21.692
>> Clay.

1:00:23.619 --> 1:00:25.388
Where is everyone?

1:00:39.778 --> 1:00:41.503
>> What'd you do,
what'd you do, what did you do?

1:00:49.755 --> 1:00:50.985
Clarissa.

1:01:04.561 --> 1:01:05.527
Oh my.

1:01:19.741 --> 1:01:23.017
>> Oh.

1:01:29.652 --> 1:01:31.993
>> What the hell happened?

1:01:32.028 --> 1:01:34.259
>> I found the tequila
bottle out there.

1:01:38.232 --> 1:01:40.463
>> I saw James.

1:01:40.498 --> 1:01:42.465
I fucking saw James.

1:01:43.401 --> 1:01:46.975
First, there was a shed
and it was purple and...

1:01:48.770 --> 1:01:52.783
Oh my God, oh my God.

1:01:52.818 --> 1:01:54.576
James is dead.

1:01:54.611 --> 1:01:55.819
James is fucking dead.

1:01:58.384 --> 1:02:00.186
Where, where's, where's Benny
and where's Blair

1:02:00.221 --> 1:02:03.453
and, and, and where we're at?

1:02:03.488 --> 1:02:05.389
I don't know. I don't know,

1:02:05.424 --> 1:02:06.863
I just I...

1:02:06.898 --> 1:02:10.691
>> Stop, stop, you're fine,
you're fine, you're fine.

1:02:10.726 --> 1:02:12.627
I just saw them.
>> No.

1:02:12.662 --> 1:02:13.837
>> I just saw them.
>> No.

1:02:13.872 --> 1:02:16.631
James's body is in
a purple shed.

1:02:17.799 --> 1:02:19.601
I. I.

1:02:29.085 --> 1:02:32.680
>> Clarissa listen,
stay with me, breathe okay.

1:02:32.715 --> 1:02:35.023
Look at me, look at me,
look at me.

1:02:37.258 --> 1:02:38.895
You're going to be okay.

1:02:38.930 --> 1:02:40.721
I'll take care of you.

1:02:42.824 --> 1:02:44.230
I believe you.

1:02:44.265 --> 1:02:46.430
We just need to
get back home

1:02:46.465 --> 1:02:48.267
and sort things out.

1:02:48.769 --> 1:02:51.303
And make things right, okay.

1:03:24.338 --> 1:03:26.877
>> Round and round
and round, you go

1:03:26.912 --> 1:03:29.704
into the shadows
you must go.

1:03:30.872 --> 1:03:33.840
Round and round,
round and round

1:03:33.875 --> 1:03:36.678
into the shadows you go.

1:03:37.747 --> 1:03:39.780
Hello, Benny.

1:03:40.354 --> 1:03:43.685
>> Fuck. Fuck you.

1:03:44.721 --> 1:03:46.490
>> It's time, Benny.

1:03:46.525 --> 1:03:48.294
I know, I know,

1:03:48.329 --> 1:03:51.935
I know, I know you
don't want to go,

1:03:51.970 --> 1:03:53.904
but it's time.

1:03:53.939 --> 1:03:54.971
>> I can't take it.

1:03:55.006 --> 1:03:58.535
>> You need to set him free.

1:03:58.970 --> 1:04:01.703
You're scared,
you're scared, you're sorry.

1:04:01.738 --> 1:04:04.871
For what were you
scared of sorry?

1:04:04.906 --> 1:04:07.148
>> I'm sorry.

1:04:07.183 --> 1:04:09.183
>> Are you sorry?
Are you sorry?

1:04:09.218 --> 1:04:10.778
>> I'm sorry.
>> Are you scared?

1:04:10.813 --> 1:04:12.351
I said, I'm sorry.

1:04:12.386 --> 1:04:14.782
>> Say it louder.
>> I'm sorry.

1:04:14.817 --> 1:04:16.993
>> You lie.
>> I'm sorry.

1:04:17.028 --> 1:04:18.929
>> Lies.
>> I'm sorry.

1:04:18.964 --> 1:04:20.931
>> I'm sorry.

1:04:29.205 --> 1:04:33.207
>> You will be shot.

1:04:35.805 --> 1:04:39.807
>> I didn't do anything,
I, I made mistakes.

1:04:40.381 --> 1:04:42.018
I made mistakes.

1:04:42.053 --> 1:04:45.747
I, I tried really.

1:04:45.782 --> 1:04:46.957
>> Goodbye Benny.
>> No.

1:05:06.407 --> 1:05:07.868
Goodbye.

1:05:22.819 --> 1:05:24.093
>> Hey, baby.

1:05:25.294 --> 1:05:26.821
You okay?

1:05:28.990 --> 1:05:30.462
>> Benny's gone.

1:05:30.497 --> 1:05:32.794
>> Wait, what
do you mean, gone?

1:05:35.106 --> 1:05:36.633
Blair.

1:05:38.901 --> 1:05:40.868
What is she talking about Clay?

1:05:42.674 --> 1:05:44.674
What is she talking about?

1:05:45.677 --> 1:05:47.215
>> They're gone.

1:05:48.119 --> 1:05:49.877
>> What did you say?

1:05:51.122 --> 1:05:52.451
>> They're gone.

1:05:55.126 --> 1:05:57.918
>> I need you to speak up.

1:05:57.953 --> 1:06:00.723
And I need you to
be a fucking man.

1:06:07.666 --> 1:06:08.995
>> I am a man.

1:06:11.670 --> 1:06:13.901
No, I am a man.

1:06:15.542 --> 1:06:16.673
Clarissa.

1:06:16.708 --> 1:06:18.048
>> Blair.

1:06:22.318 --> 1:06:23.878
Benny.

1:06:25.046 --> 1:06:26.551
Benny.

1:06:28.489 --> 1:06:32.524
Ben, where did...

1:06:32.559 --> 1:06:34.064
Where are they?

1:06:34.099 --> 1:06:35.131
Where are they Clay?

1:06:35.166 --> 1:06:39.498
>> Stop. Stop it.

1:06:44.340 --> 1:06:46.868
I won't ever hurt you again.

1:06:46.903 --> 1:06:50.179
We can finally be together,
we can be a family.

1:06:51.578 --> 1:06:52.973
>> You won't hurt me?

1:06:53.008 --> 1:06:54.150
>> Mom.

1:06:54.185 --> 1:06:56.284
>> Baby it's okay, it's okay.

1:06:56.319 --> 1:07:00.013
Don't be scared, okay,
everything's, everything's fine.

1:07:07.165 --> 1:07:09.132
>> I've been good to everyone.

1:07:10.828 --> 1:07:13.994
Haven't I?
>> Yes.

1:07:14.029 --> 1:07:16.139
>> Haven't I?
>> Yes. Yes.

1:07:22.010 --> 1:07:23.575
Dinner will be ready soon.

1:07:23.610 --> 1:07:25.577
You should both
get cleaned up.

1:07:25.612 --> 1:07:27.414
You're filthy.

1:07:28.846 --> 1:07:33.189
Oh it's your favourite dishes.

1:07:33.224 --> 1:07:35.752
I'm so excited.

1:07:38.427 --> 1:07:41.395
Oh, and,

1:07:41.430 --> 1:07:44.761
please don't be late.

1:08:03.188 --> 1:08:04.979
>> I've been calling.

1:08:06.587 --> 1:08:09.951
I call you answer.

1:08:09.986 --> 1:08:11.788
That's how this works.

1:08:12.989 --> 1:08:16.958
What do you think you're doing,
Clayton playing house?

1:08:16.993 --> 1:08:18.993
While, I take out the trash.

1:08:20.667 --> 1:08:22.964
Need I remind you?

1:08:25.243 --> 1:08:29.443
That I raised you,
I raised you.

1:08:30.446 --> 1:08:34.041
I made you,
and you were my favourite.

1:08:34.076 --> 1:08:36.417
You had such promise.

1:08:36.452 --> 1:08:38.221
Then you ran away.

1:08:38.256 --> 1:08:40.982
You ran away.

1:08:41.017 --> 1:08:42.225
You ripped us apart.

1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:44.458
You are spitting
on my sacrifices

1:08:44.493 --> 1:08:46.460
and continue to do so.

1:08:46.495 --> 1:08:50.156
I want you to come back to
what is important,

1:08:50.191 --> 1:08:52.631
us, and our company.

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:55.161
You need to
come back to me.

1:08:55.196 --> 1:08:59.704
To me, boy, boy, boy.

1:09:02.445 --> 1:09:04.137
It ends tonight?

1:09:09.287 --> 1:09:11.485
No Denver, please.

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:15.324
Please Denver. Denver.

1:10:38.376 --> 1:10:40.937
>> Would you like
some salad Clay?

1:10:42.237 --> 1:10:56.359
>> Yes, darling, I would.

1:10:56.394 --> 1:10:58.394
Oh let me help you.

1:11:02.565 --> 1:11:07.128
Can you get that?

1:11:07.163 --> 1:11:08.437
Thank you.

1:11:18.845 --> 1:11:20.141
>> Thank you.

1:11:20.176 --> 1:11:21.648
>> Of course.

1:11:30.791 --> 1:11:32.791
>> It's the outside fork.

1:11:45.300 --> 1:11:52.448
I was thinking you should take
up coding, sweetheart.

1:11:52.483 --> 1:11:54.274
I'm talking to you.

1:11:56.817 --> 1:11:58.817
>> Like computer coding.

1:12:00.887 --> 1:12:02.183
>> Mm-hmm.

1:12:04.121 --> 1:12:13.799
>> I'm not really into that.

1:12:13.834 --> 1:12:18.001
>> You'll learn
to be into it, like me.

1:12:18.036 --> 1:12:20.234
We'll start a company
together someday.

1:12:54.072 --> 1:12:55.676
Why aren't you eating?

1:13:00.342 --> 1:13:02.408
I asked a question.

1:13:02.443 --> 1:13:05.246
I ask and you answer,
that's how this works.

1:13:07.723 --> 1:13:10.152
>> What is this?

1:13:10.187 --> 1:13:12.253
What are we doing Clay?

1:13:12.288 --> 1:13:14.288
And why are
we dressed like this?

1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:24.936
>> I'm trying to
have a nice family dinner.

1:13:27.545 --> 1:13:28.940
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:13:28.975 --> 1:13:31.074
I just really, will you stop.
>> We're going.

1:13:31.109 --> 1:13:33.516
Blair, baby, get up.
We're going.

1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:36.519
>> Sit right there
and don't move.
>> Blair Baby, get up.

1:13:36.554 --> 1:13:38.521
We're going home.

1:13:39.722 --> 1:13:42.525
>> Can you please
come back to the table?

1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:45.792
We're having a dinner.
>> Get up, baby.

1:13:47.488 --> 1:13:53.360
>> No.

1:13:53.395 --> 1:13:55.164
Please sit down.

1:13:55.738 --> 1:13:58.464
Sit down.

1:13:58.499 --> 1:14:01.544
You're ruining dinner.

1:14:02.503 --> 1:14:05.240
Eat your food.
>> I can't.

1:14:07.981 --> 1:14:10.982
>> Baby let's go, let's go.

1:14:12.590 --> 1:14:15.756
>> Why are you being
so ungrateful

1:14:15.791 --> 1:14:17.560
after everything
I've done for you,

1:14:17.595 --> 1:14:21.729
you are spitting
on my sacrifices.

1:14:21.764 --> 1:14:23.423
>> Where's James, Clay

1:14:23.458 --> 1:14:24.765
and where's Benny?

1:14:28.166 --> 1:14:32.333
Stop, asking for him.

1:14:32.368 --> 1:14:34.973
I've done everything for you,
haven't I?

1:14:36.273 --> 1:14:38.779
I've been good to you,
haven't I?

1:14:38.814 --> 1:14:41.342
>> Please.

1:14:42.378 --> 1:14:43.784
>> Do you want to know?

1:14:43.819 --> 1:14:46.589
>> Please, Clay
where is Benny?

1:14:46.624 --> 1:14:48.591
>> He's gone.

1:14:49.550 --> 1:14:51.022
Gone.

1:14:55.996 --> 1:14:58.458
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:15:05.203 --> 1:15:07.203
I'm trying to protect you.

1:15:07.238 --> 1:15:09.502
Trying to protect
both of you.

1:15:14.476 --> 1:15:16.784
>> No, get away from me,
get away from me.

1:15:16.819 --> 1:15:19.380
>> Don't say that,
don't say that.

1:15:26.092 --> 1:15:28.389
>> Are you ready
to face the traumas?

1:15:35.596 --> 1:15:37.068
>> Yes.

1:15:38.676 --> 1:15:39.873
>> Good.

1:15:42.042 --> 1:15:46.044
Why don't you start with the
earliest memory of your father?

1:15:54.692 --> 1:15:58.584
>> Okay. My father's name
was Denver Kane.

1:16:01.127 --> 1:16:03.864
He took me in
at the age of four.

1:16:03.899 --> 1:16:06.064
>> Okay.

1:16:06.099 --> 1:16:07.703
It's okay, stay with me, Clay,

1:16:07.738 --> 1:16:09.705
stay with me, what else?

1:16:09.740 --> 1:16:12.070
>> No.
>> Clay.

1:16:12.908 --> 1:16:13.874
>> No.

1:16:13.909 --> 1:16:15.370
I should've been there

1:16:15.405 --> 1:16:18.879
I could have protected them
I, I could have saved them.

1:16:19.548 --> 1:16:24.346
>> You need to get rid of
the guilt and the fears.

1:16:24.381 --> 1:16:26.689
You need to let them go, Clay.

1:16:46.942 --> 1:16:49.503
>> You need to
kill off the guilt.

1:16:57.414 --> 1:16:59.084
>> I should have been there.

1:16:59.119 --> 1:17:00.580
I should have been there.

1:17:05.125 --> 1:17:06.652
I should have been there.

1:17:06.687 --> 1:17:09.523
I could have saved them.

1:17:10.130 --> 1:17:11.591
>> End this.

1:17:18.743 --> 1:17:20.908
>> What did you do Clay?

1:17:20.943 --> 1:17:23.504
>> What did you do,
what did you do, Clay?

1:17:26.146 --> 1:17:28.509
>> This must end tonight, Clay.

1:17:28.544 --> 1:17:32.348
They must all be gone.
>> No.

1:17:32.955 --> 1:17:35.582
>> She must go.

1:17:35.617 --> 1:17:40.521
They all must go.
>> No.

1:17:40.556 --> 1:17:43.128
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

1:17:43.163 --> 1:17:44.657
You're okay.

1:17:45.770 --> 1:17:48.694
It's OK, come out.

1:17:48.729 --> 1:17:50.773
>> You just, kill me,
kill me, kill me.

1:17:50.808 --> 1:17:51.741
>> No.

1:18:18.033 --> 1:18:19.835
Didn't mean to hurt you.

1:18:31.849 --> 1:18:33.783
Please. It's okay, come out.

1:18:39.615 --> 1:18:40.581
Blair.

1:18:46.061 --> 1:18:48.589
>> This is all your fault.

1:18:48.624 --> 1:18:50.624
>> I'm sorry.

1:18:51.792 --> 1:18:53.297
>> Blair.

1:18:55.433 --> 1:18:57.235
>> It's too late, Clay.

1:18:57.270 --> 1:18:58.764
You couldn't save us.

1:18:58.799 --> 1:19:00.634
You can save her.

1:19:03.804 --> 1:19:05.639
>> I'm sorry.

1:19:08.644 --> 1:19:10.710
>> You were his favourite.

1:19:10.745 --> 1:19:13.823
He did this for you,
for you, for you, for you.

1:19:28.103 --> 1:19:31.907
>> Blair, I'll protect you now.

1:19:33.735 --> 1:19:35.735
>> Stay away from me.

1:19:37.079 --> 1:19:38.771
Stay away from me.

1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:43.853
>> Blair.

1:19:44.284 --> 1:19:45.481
Blair.

1:19:50.092 --> 1:19:51.322
Blair.

1:19:51.753 --> 1:19:52.895
Blair.

1:19:57.858 --> 1:20:00.661
>> Help! Help! Help!

1:20:00.696 --> 1:20:02.168
>> Ahh!

1:20:29.725 --> 1:20:32.198
>> It all ends tonight.

1:20:39.405 --> 1:20:41.702
>> No, no, no.

1:20:41.737 --> 1:20:43.913
You just stay with me,
stay with me, stay with me.

1:20:43.948 --> 1:20:45.310
Stay with me, stay with me.

1:20:45.345 --> 1:20:47.147
Oh my god,
oh my God, oh my God.

1:20:47.182 --> 1:20:48.874
No, no.

1:20:48.909 --> 1:20:52.185
Oh God.

1:21:28.949 --> 1:21:30.784
I'm sorry.

1:21:32.392 --> 1:21:34.590
I should have protected you.

1:21:35.225 --> 1:21:37.967
I should have protected you.

1:21:38.002 --> 1:21:42.565
>> Round and round
and round you go.

1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:45.865
Into the shadows,
Clay must go.

1:21:49.046 --> 1:21:51.178
I did this for us, Clay.

1:21:51.213 --> 1:21:53.642
>> It needs to
end tonight, Clay.

1:21:54.876 --> 1:21:57.778
You must
move past all the guilt.

1:21:57.813 --> 1:22:02.420
You must kill
all of the trauma.

1:22:03.654 --> 1:22:06.226
You must finish this.

1:22:06.261 --> 1:22:08.888
>> You've always been
my favourite.

1:22:08.923 --> 1:22:12.034
I did this, so you would
come back to me

1:22:12.069 --> 1:22:14.696
and I could
keep you to myself.

1:22:14.731 --> 1:22:18.733
Keep you all to myself forever.

1:22:30.285 --> 1:22:34.089
I've always been
good to you, Clayton, haven't I?

1:22:37.457 --> 1:22:40.920
I've always been
good to you, haven't I?

1:22:46.103 --> 1:22:50.072
It must end tonight, Clay.

1:22:50.107 --> 1:22:52.338
You must set yourself free.

1:22:56.938 --> 1:22:59.279
>> I forgive you father.

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:04.845
>> My favourite.

1:23:05.518 --> 1:23:08.057
>> Always and forever.

1:24:57.663 --> 1:24:58.959
Sorry.

1:26:05.126 --> 1:26:07.896
>> Where are we
right now, Clay?

1:26:10.736 --> 1:26:13.066
Clay, where are we
right now?

1:26:14.872 --> 1:26:16.872
>> It's done.

1:26:18.546 --> 1:26:20.073
>> What's done?

1:26:24.354 --> 1:26:26.145
>> I set them free.

1:26:27.082 --> 1:26:30.886
I set myself free.

1:26:32.527 --> 1:26:36.298
>> How do you feel about that?

1:26:41.536 --> 1:26:43.536
>> The best that I can.

1:26:47.377 --> 1:26:48.904
>> Good.

1:26:54.912 --> 1:27:00.487
I am so proud of you Clay.

1:27:00.522 --> 1:27:03.017
You had a breakthrough
here today.

1:27:05.285 --> 1:27:08.693
You dealt with a lot.

1:27:08.728 --> 1:27:11.465
You were
able to kill off a lot

1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:15.535
of the pain and the agony.

1:27:17.572 --> 1:27:20.573
You were able to
kill off the guilts.

1:27:21.378 --> 1:27:23.906
You faced the ones you loved

1:27:23.941 --> 1:27:26.205
and the ones who lost.

1:27:28.517 --> 1:27:31.551
This will help you find
the peace within you.

1:27:33.984 --> 1:27:35.324
>> Thank you.

1:27:38.021 --> 1:27:42.188
>> Be kind to yourself
for these next few days.

1:27:42.223 --> 1:27:44.223
Take things slow.

1:28:09.987 --> 1:28:12.394
>> I'll see you next week.

1:28:12.429 --> 1:28:15.430
>> If you need to
you know where to find me.

1:28:38.455 --> 1:28:39.388
>> Hey.

1:29:55.125 --> 1:29:56.465
>> Sir.

1:30:00.097 --> 1:30:02.768
>> To the office, please.

1:30:03.331 --> 1:30:04.704
>> Very well, sir.
