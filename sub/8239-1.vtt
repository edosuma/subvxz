[ clears throat ]

00:25.389 --> 00:29.491
Matthew 5:17 begins,

00:29.493 --> 00:33.528
"do not think that I came to
destroy the law of the prophets."

00:33.530 --> 00:37.064
I did not come to destroy them,
but to fulfill them.

00:37.066 --> 00:39.132
Because I tell all of you
with certainty

00:39.134 --> 00:41.534
that until heaven and earth
disappear,

00:41.536 --> 00:43.802
not one letter
or one stroke of a letter

00:43.804 --> 00:45.703
will disappear from the law

00:45.705 --> 00:48.706
"until everything
has been accomplished."

01:02.488 --> 01:05.589
Hell... Fire.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.761
Those two words...
"hell fire"...

01:11.763 --> 01:14.663
came from Jesus's lips directly.

01:14.665 --> 01:16.331
The son of God spoke them,

01:16.333 --> 01:18.366
and there is no
misunderstanding him.

01:18.368 --> 01:23.604
He spoke them as two words...
"hell fire."

01:23.606 --> 01:27.074
So as to be perfectly
crystal clear on what he means,

01:27.076 --> 01:30.644
he is describing the place,
hell.

01:38.553 --> 01:42.287
But there is a problem
at work today, a mortal problem,

01:42.289 --> 01:44.022
and we are not talking about it.

01:44.024 --> 01:48.025
Jesus spoke those two words...
"hell fire"...

01:48.027 --> 01:49.860
and nobody
wants to hear about it.

01:49.862 --> 01:53.463
We are comforted by Jesus
the savior, Jesus the healer.

01:53.465 --> 01:55.398
God who sent his only son

01:55.400 --> 01:58.367
down to earth itself
to sacrifice himself for us,

01:58.369 --> 02:01.203
and we feel good
when we repeat those stories.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.871
We fold our hands in thanks

02:02.873 --> 02:05.940
and then move about our lives
as though all is fine,

02:05.942 --> 02:11.879
but we do not want to think
about those actual words.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.280
You can walk this earth

02:13.282 --> 02:14.814
and claim
he is in you all you want,

02:14.816 --> 02:20.318
but you will be judged
on your actions.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.421
Hell is real. It does exist.

02:23.423 --> 02:27.758
Hell fire... simply spoken,
and praise be to God for it.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.559

to think about that,

02:29.561 --> 02:30.793

02:35.465 --> 02:37.498
Could be
right outside those doors.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.899
It does not matter.

02:38.901 --> 02:41.868
We all stand before him
for our judgment.

02:44.305 --> 02:47.739

where you are going to wake up.

[ grunts ]

22:58.749 --> 23:01.282
My farmer the other day.
He's telling me,

23:01.284 --> 23:02.983
got to do this with the margins,
got to do that with...

23:02.985 --> 23:04.684
what the hell
are you talking about?

23:04.686 --> 23:07.520
- Got to be kidding.
- Isn't he 12?

23:07.522 --> 23:08.921
Fellas.

23:08.923 --> 23:10.789
John.

23:10.791 --> 23:13.925
Say, where did you mention Dale
was getting his nutrients now?

23:13.927 --> 23:16.127
Some new formula
that's cheaper or something?

23:16.129 --> 23:17.361
Cheaper? No.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.363
Better, yes.

23:19.365 --> 23:22.699
It's the research
they're pitching, anyway.

23:22.701 --> 23:25.702
I don't know... he's got
some new rep coming by.

23:25.704 --> 23:27.336
Why?

23:27.338 --> 23:29.504
My margins are shit.
I got to do something different.

23:29.506 --> 23:31.939
Thanks, franny.

23:31.941 --> 23:34.141
Well, bend Dale's ear.

23:34.143 --> 23:36.476
He's deep into something.

23:36.478 --> 23:39.946
[ Groans ]
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.

23:39.948 --> 23:42.848
Afternoon. What's blowing
up your skirt today?

23:42.850 --> 23:45.217
Uh, no, nothing like that.

23:45.219 --> 23:47.519
There is a bit of commotion
this morning, though.

23:47.521 --> 23:49.988
Franny?

23:49.990 --> 23:53.124
Sheriff just got back from up
by the dam there.

23:53.126 --> 23:55.993
They found Dutch Miller's
rowboat spinning around up there

23:55.995 --> 23:59.296
this morning, full of gear,
but no Dutch.

23:59.298 --> 24:01.531
Damn fool probably got drunk
and fell in.

24:01.533 --> 24:04.066
No, not anymore... not
with his new holy roller thing.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.835
The charlatan just probably
skipped town.

24:06.837 --> 24:09.571
Oh, well, look, I don't know.
I don't know about that.

24:09.573 --> 24:11.406
But his old lady
put in her report, too.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.875
Apparently hasn't been home
in three days,

24:13.877 --> 24:15.977
so they're dragging the lake
right now.

24:15.979 --> 24:17.845
Hell, that's...

24:17.847 --> 24:19.479
well, that's too bad.

24:21.483 --> 24:23.583
He burned down Merlin's barn.

24:26.054 --> 24:27.753
What?

24:27.755 --> 24:29.554
15 years ago.

24:29.556 --> 24:32.757
Yeah, 15 years ago, he got drunk
and burned down Merlin's barn.

24:32.759 --> 24:34.892
Carl, what in the hell
are you talking about?

24:34.894 --> 24:36.493
He burned down
your brother's barn?

24:36.495 --> 24:37.727
Yeah, yeah.

24:37.729 --> 24:39.428
I drove by the other day
to tell him.

24:39.430 --> 24:41.229
Said he was real sorry and all.

24:41.231 --> 24:42.897
Said he saw hell,

24:42.899 --> 24:44.598
and he was real sorry
and all now.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.400
Jesus Christ, Carl,
when will you...

24:47.402 --> 24:49.568
I mean, that's a pretty God
damn big one, don't you think?

24:49.570 --> 24:51.336
Yeah, yeah, a big one.

24:51.338 --> 24:54.172
Well, I know he was talking
to damn near everyone.

24:54.174 --> 24:55.406
Surprised you
didn't know that one.

24:55.408 --> 24:56.740
Well, I heard some of it.

24:56.742 --> 24:59.008
I mean,
but not the whole God damn barn.

24:59.010 --> 25:00.676
Ah, he was out to ray Reynolds

25:00.678 --> 25:02.244
about the money
he stole from him.

25:02.246 --> 25:04.045
Just the other night,
he was down in the bar

25:04.047 --> 25:08.281
pulling damn near everyone aside
on a real mission, apparently.

25:08.283 --> 25:11.284
He come out to see you, John?

25:11.286 --> 25:13.586
No.

25:13.588 --> 25:16.922
No, I haven't, uh...

25:16.924 --> 25:19.557
I haven't talked to Dutch
in years now.

25:19.559 --> 25:24.394
Well, I imagine he will be
or would be or would have been.

25:24.396 --> 25:25.762
Oh, you know.

25:25.764 --> 25:28.431
Oh, you know,
all the stories with...

25:28.433 --> 25:30.566
well, you know.

25:30.568 --> 25:33.835
People always said
he was with dede, you know?

25:37.073 --> 25:38.739
- You know.
- Yeah, well, I...

25:38.741 --> 25:40.240
I heard plenty.

25:40.242 --> 25:44.610
Most of that,
just not about the barn.

25:44.612 --> 25:46.478
Danny, you know,
ain't none too happy

25:46.480 --> 25:48.546
about these Dutch confessions.

25:48.548 --> 25:50.214
He, uh, hasn't seen the light

25:50.216 --> 25:52.382
or whatever like his brother,
you know?

25:52.384 --> 25:55.486
Danny maybe killed Dutch
himself, huh... to shut him up?

25:55.488 --> 25:56.720
- No.
- That right, ace?

25:56.722 --> 25:59.989
No, I'm just...
I'm just saying.

25:59.991 --> 26:02.423
At least he didn't burn down
your barn.

26:05.060 --> 26:08.561
God damn it, Carl, you...

26:08.563 --> 26:11.597
Jesus.

26:11.599 --> 26:13.432
And, um... and so...

26:13.434 --> 26:15.233
so if I just have something
that he can tug on with.

26:15.235 --> 26:16.834
If he's acting aggressively,

26:16.836 --> 26:18.569
we'll just... he'll just
take it out on the tugging.

26:18.571 --> 26:21.672
You know, when I look
in his eyes in those moments,

26:21.674 --> 26:24.408
his eyes are not
the "I want to kill you"

26:24.410 --> 26:26.743
sort of eyes of a creature
that's trying to hurt you.

26:26.745 --> 26:28.911
His eyes are sort of
in the kind of like...

26:28.913 --> 26:30.612
- hi. Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

26:30.614 --> 26:32.213
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, man, no.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.548
- Hey, flip that shit over, man.
- That's my bad.

26:34.550 --> 26:36.716
- There you go.
- Ooh, that's a lot of coffee.

26:36.718 --> 26:39.085
It's okay, it's my bad. Fuck.

26:39.087 --> 26:41.687
Do you have paper towels?
Here you go.

26:41.689 --> 26:43.355
That should be good.
Thanks a lot, Teddy.

26:43.357 --> 26:45.590
- I got this.
- Perfect.

26:45.592 --> 26:48.426
All right, yep.
That's all we need is that.

26:48.428 --> 26:49.860
- Here, take a little bit more.
- Yeah, maybe.

26:49.862 --> 26:51.094
Time is of the essence here.

26:51.096 --> 26:52.929
- Okay, I got this.
- There you go.

26:52.931 --> 26:55.298
Here, you got that end?
I'll be the skewers.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.432
Go for it, yeah.

26:56.434 --> 26:57.800
Oh, yeah, got to double it.

26:57.802 --> 26:59.301
Triple it!

26:59.303 --> 27:01.102
Yeah. Yo, hustle.

27:01.104 --> 27:03.037
- This is enough.
- No, no, no, no.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.706
- This is good.
- This is not nearly enough.

27:05.708 --> 27:09.109
Need more, Mike.
Got to have it.

27:09.111 --> 27:10.877
I'm proud of you. Keep going.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.979
He came to work really high,
so I have to fuck with him.

27:12.981 --> 27:16.115
- That's mean.
- I don't know about mean, but...

27:16.117 --> 27:19.318
I'm moving, man.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.487
Okay.

- Uh, just Kate.

27:24.557 --> 27:26.056

here, right, man?

27:27.659 --> 27:28.924
- Yeah!
- That's about it?

27:28.926 --> 27:32.594
Let go, we're done.

27:32.596 --> 27:35.063
All right, that should do it.

27:35.065 --> 27:36.631
I think so.

27:36.633 --> 27:38.766
Well done, sir.
Thank you very much.

27:38.768 --> 27:40.634
- Yeah, I do what I can.
- Just save that for later.

27:40.636 --> 27:42.636
- That's a lot of paper.
- Yeah, a lot of paper.

27:42.638 --> 27:45.438
We'll maybe use it next time.

- I'm the quicker.

for the barrage of e-mails

28:09.759 --> 28:11.492

with the latest details, then.

- You sure?

29:07.838 --> 29:09.070
Yeah, yeah.

going all right, though?

Is Ben planning
on coming up real soon?

29:15.877 --> 29:19.011
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't know.

29:19.013 --> 29:20.412
Nothing planned.

29:20.414 --> 29:23.081
I talked to him the other day.

29:23.083 --> 29:25.049
It seems like everything's
going real good.

29:25.051 --> 29:26.517
Great.

29:26.519 --> 29:28.552
Still does that computer stuff
down there?

29:28.554 --> 29:31.221
Yeah, he's doing
some commercials and stuff.

29:31.223 --> 29:33.389
I seen a couple
on TV the other day.

doing okay in it.

He's doing well.

Oh.

Dale said it looked like you got
cut up pretty good on something.

29:51.072 --> 29:54.239
Yeah? Oh, no, no.
I got a couple scratches.

29:54.241 --> 29:58.042
I took a bit of a tumble getting
some of the bushes up there.

29:58.044 --> 29:59.610
A tumble? What kind of tumble?

29:59.612 --> 30:01.912
You okay?
Well, you know, it wasn't -

30:01.914 --> 30:03.413
wasn't really a tumble.

30:03.415 --> 30:04.847
It was kind of... - geez, John.

30:04.849 --> 30:06.682
You know we're nearly always
around over here

30:06.684 --> 30:09.184

30:09.186 --> 30:10.618
You can pretend
you don't want these

31:34.669 --> 31:36.568
Hey, Danny.

31:39.139 --> 31:42.173
All right.

Hey, uh...

I'm sorry to hear
about your brother.

32:01.356 --> 32:05.524
Uh, listen, I'll, uh...

32:05.526 --> 32:08.193
I'll... I'll just let you be.

32:08.195 --> 32:12.997
Sheriff seems to think
he got drunk and just fell in.

32:12.999 --> 32:16.833
They've been dragging that
God damn lake all afternoon.

32:16.835 --> 32:19.969
No body yet.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.870
Yeah.

32:21.872 --> 32:24.339
I heard.

32:24.341 --> 32:25.973
I doubt that, though.

32:28.177 --> 32:31.978
No way Dutch drowns in there.

32:31.980 --> 32:36.882
Well, let's hope not.

32:36.884 --> 32:40.485
They're just, you know,
doing what they can.

32:50.897 --> 32:53.898
You know, maybe, uh...

32:53.900 --> 32:57.601
maybe he just took off
for a bit, you know.

32:57.603 --> 33:00.337
Dodging somebody or something?

33:02.174 --> 33:03.740
Yeah.

33:03.742 --> 33:05.942
Plenty of reason for that,
lately.

33:09.514 --> 33:13.749
I've never seen a guy
so upset in my entire life.

33:13.751 --> 33:20.121
That vision or whatever
just scared the shit out of him.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.756
Yeah, I know.
I heard about that.

33:22.758 --> 33:24.624
You know, he had quite a bit
to say to a few people

33:24.626 --> 33:27.927
in particular.

33:27.929 --> 33:31.897
Did he come see
you the other evening?

33:31.899 --> 33:36.134
I haven't talked to Dutch in...
in a long time.

33:39.772 --> 33:42.105
To be honest, you know,
there's a lot of people in town

33:42.107 --> 33:46.609
have been pretty worried about
him for the last few weeks.

33:53.484 --> 33:55.984
Well...

33:55.986 --> 34:00.388
Like I said, I'll, uh...

34:00.390 --> 34:02.156
I'll just let you be.
You know, I'm sitting here

34:02.158 --> 34:05.125
because this is
where they found his truck.

34:05.127 --> 34:09.962
So, I figure,
this is where he bought it.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.097
And they say from time to time
that the killer

34:12.099 --> 34:16.967
will come on back to the scene
of the crime, you know.

34:16.969 --> 34:19.704
Oh... Yeah.

34:23.176 --> 34:24.775
So, the past few evenings,

34:24.777 --> 34:26.777
I've just been sitting here
having a few smokes

34:26.779 --> 34:29.612
and seeing who drives by.

34:29.614 --> 34:33.350
Well, pretty...

34:33.351 --> 34:35.284
pretty busy road, Danny,
you know?

34:35.286 --> 34:39.522
You must have seen a lot
of people passing by.

34:39.524 --> 34:42.157
Oh, yeah, quite a few.

34:48.498 --> 34:50.364
Oh, boy. More changes?

34:50.366 --> 34:51.764
Yes, correct, correct.

34:51.766 --> 34:54.434
- Are you filling him in?
