- Yeah. Work it out.
- ED: Oh, my. Go, go, go!

03:07.439 --> 03:10.275
MADELINE: I should have never googled him,
or stirred you up like that.

03:10.359 --> 03:12.986
This is my problem in life,
I can never let dead dogs lie.

03:13.111 --> 03:16.114
Well, but that's the problem, he's not dead.

03:16.782 --> 03:19.242
For all we know,
he's out there right now assaulting women.

03:19.326 --> 03:22.871
Can I ask you,
when you went on this little road trip,

03:22.954 --> 03:24.289
did you take your gun?

03:26.958 --> 03:27.959
No.

03:28.043 --> 03:30.128
- You don't sound sure.
- I didn't take my gun.

03:30.212 --> 03:33.840
And had this Saxon Baker been the guy,
what would you have done?

03:33.965 --> 03:35.884
Were there others?

03:35.967 --> 03:38.512
Other Saxons in your Internet search?

03:39.179 --> 03:42.099
Listen, you moved to Monterey to start over.
To build a future.

03:42.182 --> 03:45.060
I suggest you focus on that. Not the past.

But it's the play and it's opening night.

04:13.046 --> 04:14.423
Oh...

04:16.382 --> 04:19.344
Well, well. I'll see it when I get back.

04:21.846 --> 04:24.224
It's opening night.

04:24.349 --> 04:30.105
Madeline's gonna be so disappointed.
It's a whole big thing.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.315
I don't want you going to the premiere either.

04:32.399 --> 04:33.525
What?

04:34.359 --> 04:36.278
Come to Phoenix with me.

Baby, I can't...

04:38.530 --> 04:42.451
Look I know "Come to Phoenix with me" isn't
the most romantic thing you've ever heard,

-but we can...
-(LAUGHING)

04:44.619 --> 04:46.496
We can sneak off to Sedona, for a night...

04:46.580 --> 04:49.124
- No, I can't do that.
- Why?

04:49.207 --> 04:52.502
Because she will never speak to me again.
It's a big thing for her.

04:52.586 --> 04:55.130
- Madeline's beginning to piss me off.
- Oh...

04:57.215 --> 05:01.011
How often do we get a chance to sneak away,
just the two of us?

05:01.094 --> 05:03.555
- Look what you're doing! Look at it...
- What, what?

05:04.473 --> 05:09.060
You're the one who suddenly has to leave,
and I am the one who disappoints... (SCOFFS)

05:13.565 --> 05:14.566
Huh?

05:15.150 --> 05:17.027
Just a little romantic here.

to be ugly sometimes.

05:36.087 --> 05:37.964
That's like life.

05:38.089 --> 05:42.344

Yeah, well, it won't be
a secret for much longer.

06:02.989 --> 06:06.159
- My official unveiling is on Wednesday.
- Wow.

06:06.493 --> 06:08.119
You've been working really hard on this.

06:08.203 --> 06:10.413
Well, colleges look for
passion projects now, you know.

06:10.497 --> 06:14.042
It's not just about, like, your GPA,
and being captain of volleyball.

thank you for having the dinner on Tuesday.

I know you and Mom really don't get along,
or necessarily want to,

06:27.681 --> 06:31.142
but the idea that we could all be together
sometimes like we used to,

06:32.394 --> 06:33.645
it's kind of cool.

<i>What could you possibly say?</i>

07:11.558 --> 07:12.601
Excuse me?

07:12.684 --> 07:14.394
Well, I mean,
she can hardly relate to my life.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.229
What on Earth is she gonna do
to identify with yours?

07:16.354 --> 07:18.356
Which is just a tick north of perfect.

08:34.265 --> 08:35.308
Yeah.

08:35.600 --> 08:40.270
There is evidently a petition circulating,

08:40.355 --> 08:43.274
calling for Ziggy's suspension.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.567
His suspension?

08:44.651 --> 08:48.446
I am furious about it, as is Mr. Nippal,
and we will get it stopped.

08:49.864 --> 08:53.368
- But in the meantime...
- Are people actually signing this?

08:53.451 --> 08:55.203

Even Amabella plays with him.

This is about the parents,

A lot of parents are probably
applauding you right now.

There's more than one person
in this town who wants to deck Renata Klein,

yours truly included.

10:46.231 --> 10:48.149
I actually think this is a good thing.

10:48.233 --> 10:50.777
It's high time that people know
they shouldn't fuck with Jane Chapman,

10:51.236 --> 10:53.321
and they're not gonna mess
with your kid, either.

10:53.404 --> 10:55.073
I had my gun.

10:55.156 --> 10:56.449
What?

10:57.242 --> 10:59.994
I had my gun, in my purse
when I went to San Luis Obispo.

11:00.078 --> 11:02.747
I don't think I would have shot him,
but I had it.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.416
Okay.

11:06.918 --> 11:10.880
Well I'm not gonna lie, that gives me pause.

11:10.964 --> 11:13.174
Yeah, it gives me pause, too.

11:14.843 --> 11:16.594
Like I think I'm going insane.

that whoever he is, is a nice guy.

That like, maybe that night
was just a bad misunderstanding,

11:26.437 --> 11:28.106
or a night gone wrong,

11:29.482 --> 11:32.277
or he had a bad day,
or his parents got in a car crash.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.112
And like, I make up these crazy excuses

11:34.195 --> 11:38.616
because I'm so desperate to believe
that Ziggy's father is actually a good person.

11:49.544 --> 11:54.841
Well he's been very, um...

11:54.966 --> 11:57.969

11:58.052 --> 12:02.473
Which usually means
he's feeling insecure, or...

12:03.641 --> 12:05.310
Or what?

12:05.393 --> 12:07.645
Or it means I have the power.

12:09.981 --> 12:13.818
Sometimes he has it. Sometimes I have it.
It's like a seesaw.

12:15.695 --> 12:17.739
When do you get the power?

12:18.865 --> 12:20.825
After he hits you?

12:22.827 --> 12:25.747
Yeah, when he hurts me I get the upper hand.

12:28.416 --> 12:32.503
The more he hurts me,
the higher I go, the longer I stay. Until...

12:36.341 --> 12:42.055
He's been, um, ahem,
very loving the last few days.

12:42.180 --> 12:46.017
- But at some point he gets the power back.
- Mmm.

12:49.187 --> 12:52.106
Usually when my bruises fade,

12:54.192 --> 12:56.027
and he doesn't feel as guilty.

12:56.110 --> 12:59.948
He feels insecure,
and then it all happens again.

13:00.031 --> 13:01.324
Where is he now?

13:01.407 --> 13:04.118
He is in Phoenix. He left this morning.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.709
When are you going to leave him, Celeste?

13:12.627 --> 13:15.838
-(SCOFFS)
- When he hurts you badly enough?

13:15.922 --> 13:18.549
When he hurts the children?

13:18.633 --> 13:19.801
He will never hurt the children...

13:19.884 --> 13:22.553
You need to rent an apartment.

13:23.388 --> 13:27.392
Locally, if you don't wanna
disrupt the boys' school.

13:27.475 --> 13:30.728
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves here.

13:30.812 --> 13:32.480
No, I don't think so.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.066
Stock the refrigerator,

13:35.149 --> 13:38.778
make sure the utilities are paid for,
have the beds set up for the kids.

13:38.903 --> 13:40.989
Get it all ready,

13:42.407 --> 13:45.493
so we can at least remove, "Where on
God's Earth would I go?" from the equation.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.286
You'll have a place,

13:47.745 --> 13:52.166
a mind-set, another life
standing by should you need it,

13:52.250 --> 13:55.169
which we both know you will.

13:55.586 --> 13:59.340
I don't think a therapist should be this, um...

13:59.424 --> 14:01.134
I don't think you should be behaving like this.

14:01.259 --> 14:03.761
I'll get you the number of the
Better Business Bureau, you can report me.

14:03.845 --> 14:07.098
In the meantime,
start documenting the abuse.

14:07.932 --> 14:09.892
Write everything down,

14:09.976 --> 14:13.146
photograph your injuries,
keep doctor reports.

14:13.271 --> 14:15.273
That could be important in a custody battle

14:16.357 --> 14:18.818
and men like your husband
typically do go for custody.

14:18.943 --> 14:23.364
He has the resources,
the money, the contacts,

14:23.448 --> 14:26.534
most importantly,

14:26.617 --> 14:30.538
he has the ego to see this through.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.166
I don't understand why
you're being such an alarmist right now.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.626
- Nothing's...
- Because I'm alarmed.

14:38.337 --> 14:41.299
Have you told anybody else about the abuse?

14:43.468 --> 14:44.469
No.

14:45.470 --> 14:46.929
- Why not?
- I don't know.

14:47.013 --> 14:48.514
If you were to guess...

14:51.976 --> 14:52.977
(SCOFFS)

14:55.354 --> 15:00.485
Perhaps my self-worth is made up
of how other people see me.

15:01.486 --> 15:02.528
(CHUCKLES)

15:03.988 --> 15:05.114
I'm sorry.

15:05.198 --> 15:09.911
I'm just amazed by patients who can harbor
such profound self-awareness

15:09.994 --> 15:12.413
underneath the hard shell of denial.

15:12.497 --> 15:15.166
Find a friend to confide in. Do it today.

15:16.167 --> 15:17.210
(SIGHS) Because...

15:17.335 --> 15:21.506
Because if there is a custody battle,
you know what Perry's lawyer will be asking.

15:21.589 --> 15:25.301
"Did you ever tell anybody, Mrs. Wright?"

15:25.384 --> 15:26.427
Hmm?

15:27.345 --> 15:29.430
"Really, you told nobody at all?

15:29.514 --> 15:31.933
"Is that because it never really happened,

15:32.016 --> 15:34.936
"and you're just making all this up
to win custody?

15:36.562 --> 15:41.901
"In fact, you've repeatedly maintained
what a wonderful husband and father Perry is.

15:42.026 --> 15:43.277
"Haven't you, Mrs. Wright?

15:44.695 --> 15:49.117
"Nobody's ever witnessed this
alleged abuse, ever.

You're a lawyer.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.972
You know how important it is
to have a witness.

16:14.559 --> 16:15.643
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:15.726 --> 16:18.229
- Juliette? Right?
- RENATA: What do you want?

16:24.569 --> 16:25.611
Uh...

16:28.990 --> 16:32.618
I just wanted to say that I'm so sorry.

16:34.078 --> 16:36.497
I completely lost control,
and I stepped out of line,

16:36.581 --> 16:39.250
and I should've never shoved you like that,
there are no excuses.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.793
And I'm so sorry.

16:41.252 --> 16:43.254
Yeah. (SCOFFS)

16:51.929 --> 16:57.685
The truth is, is I finally realized that I've been
feeling exactly what you must be feeling.

16:57.768 --> 17:01.230
There's nothing worse than your child
being victimized, right?

17:03.774 --> 17:07.737
So, I understand and completely empathize
with what you're going through.

17:09.070 --> 17:12.909
I am as sure as any parent can be
that Ziggy is innocent.

17:12.992 --> 17:14.410
I took him to a child psychologist.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.038
And she examined him and tested him,

17:17.121 --> 17:19.207
and said that he was a gentle young boy

17:19.290 --> 17:22.460
who's completely incapable
of doing what he's been accused of.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.630
Renata, I am at my wit's end.

17:26.422 --> 17:28.841
I don't know what to do anymore.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.260
Does Amabella still say that he's hurting her?

17:32.970 --> 17:37.141
No. She says he's a sweet boy.

17:37.975 --> 17:40.311
And orientation?

17:41.646 --> 17:43.856
Well, she hasn't taken back the accusation.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.486
But she refuses to talk to us
about anything further.

17:50.613 --> 17:53.366
You think you're at your wits' end,

17:53.491 --> 17:57.495
my daughter's the one getting hurt,
and I can't stop it.

17:59.497 --> 18:01.123
(SOFTLY) I'm so sorry.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.335
Me, too.

18:09.548 --> 18:10.883
Thank you.

18:12.343 --> 18:13.678
Thank you.

18:17.306 --> 18:19.600
Yeah. My baby lost another baby tooth.

18:19.684 --> 18:21.811
- I put it under my pillow.
- Good.

18:21.894 --> 18:24.981
There is no Tooth Fairy, idiot.
It's Mom and Dad.

18:25.064 --> 18:26.983
Would you please get me a tissue?

18:27.066 --> 18:29.193
- Is it bleeding?
- No, not a lot.

18:29.735 --> 18:31.487
(GROWLING)

18:31.570 --> 18:33.489
- Are there any bad teenagers in here?
- Dad!

18:33.572 --> 18:35.116
What are you doing here?

18:35.199 --> 18:36.575
Hey, boys.

18:37.535 --> 18:40.204
Don't we have a premiere to attend tonight?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.999
You made it back for the play?

18:43.082 --> 18:44.667
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.002
They're gonna kiss.

18:46.085 --> 18:47.128
You did that for me?

Yeah, of course.

Wow! Kazowie.

Did you say, "Kazowie"?

18:58.389 --> 19:00.933
I did. You look fantastic.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.184
Thank you, honey.

19:02.268 --> 19:03.352
What, you got a big date or something?

19:03.436 --> 19:05.896
As a matter of fact I do. A very big date.

19:06.063 --> 19:10.192
Oh. Congrats on your opening night!

19:10.276 --> 19:12.611
Thank you, honey.

19:12.737 --> 19:14.947
I don't really have
anything to do with it anymore.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.741
You have a huge amount to do with it.

19:16.866 --> 19:19.910
It wouldn't even be happening, but for you.
Are you kidding?

19:23.247 --> 19:25.082
- Let's go.
- Okay.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.768
Remember you're not
allowed to sing that one.

19:43.893 --> 19:46.479
- Okay.
- You can play it, but you can't sing it.

19:46.604 --> 19:47.938
Why can't I go to the play?

19:48.064 --> 19:49.357
It's not really for kids.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.816
I like puppets.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.651
I know you do.

19:52.777 --> 19:55.071
Is it because the puppets have sex?

19:55.821 --> 19:57.448
- Who told you that?
- Chloe.

19:57.573 --> 20:01.160
She said the boy puppet
puts his penis in the girl puppet.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.497

26:25.127 --> 26:27.171
Sorry, maybe I am envious.

26:29.173 --> 26:32.676
What, Perry walks through the door
and“.VVhoosh.

26:34.052 --> 26:35.512
Wish we had that kind of desire.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.890
(SCOFFS) Well, by "we" you mean me.

26:38.015 --> 26:40.184
Okay, you're a fiery person.

26:42.853 --> 26:48.484
Which makes your tepidness for me
more conspicuous.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.446
I don't mean to punish you.

26:52.529 --> 26:53.906
Well, I mean, it feels like you are.

26:54.031 --> 26:55.032
I tell myself all the time,

26:55.157 --> 26:57.159
like married people, you know,

26:57.242 --> 27:02.539
after a while, they reach this sexual plateau
and that's the norm.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.753
I hear about other couples,
you know, breaking urethras and...

27:09.213 --> 27:11.882
Well, it's hardly like you're
some sort of raging bull, Ed.

27:12.007 --> 27:15.177
The only time you touch me is when you're
reaching across me to get the Visine for...

27:15.260 --> 27:17.930
That's because you don't want it, Madeline.

27:18.055 --> 27:22.059
And we never talk about that
because that would make it harder to pretend.

27:23.393 --> 27:26.980
And sometimes that's the essence
of a happy marriage, isn't it?

27:27.064 --> 27:29.233
The ability to pretend.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.963
In the days leading up to Trivia Night,

27:51.088 --> 27:53.715
it just seemed more and more people
wanted to kill each other.

27:53.799 --> 27:55.259
It was hard to keep track.

28:26.498 --> 28:29.251
Abby told me that
Chloe said that Ed was rehearsing.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.962
They say he's pretty good,
so, I'm gonna kick his ass.

28:33.463 --> 28:35.424
I was just...
What, I'm inspired by the whole play thing.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.509
And besides I'm sick and tired
of his little fucking digs,

28:37.634 --> 28:39.845
like he's the cultural shit or something.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.263
I'm gonna show him who's evolved.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.764

28:47.644 --> 28:48.645
If you're looking for trouble...

28:48.770 --> 28:51.523
Baby, the whole point of this dinner
is to try and reduce the friction

28:51.648 --> 28:55.152
that contributes to an unhealthy environment.

28:55.277 --> 28:56.278
...came to the right place.

28:56.361 --> 28:57.738
Yeah, between Madeline and I.

28:57.821 --> 28:59.448
But friction between Ed and I is fine.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.910
First of all,
I'm very disappointed in your attitude.

29:02.993 --> 29:07.372
And second, and more importantly,
we have a bigger problem.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.500
Abigail's secret project.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.211
Yeah, what about it?

ED: Just for tonight.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.868
It's been 15 years. Why not?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.632
So you think our marriage is pretend?

29:58.715 --> 30:03.220
No. I said that in every marriage
there is pretending.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.890
Even the best ones.

30:09.101 --> 30:12.521
You said it was the essence,
if I heard you correctly.

30:13.897 --> 30:16.274
I mean, I don't pretend to love you.

30:16.400 --> 30:18.402
I know you don't pretend to love me.

30:20.237 --> 30:23.073
But what I do like to pretend, as do you,

30:24.616 --> 30:27.202
is that I'm all that.

30:28.745 --> 30:33.208
So is this back to the "Steady Eddie" theme?
Is that what we're talking about?

30:33.291 --> 30:36.044
No, Madeline. I'm the lucky one.

30:36.128 --> 30:41.049
I get to wake up every day
next to the girl of my dreams.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.844
That makes me the winner.

30:43.927 --> 30:47.597
I just feel like the loser sometimes.

30:53.562 --> 30:55.731
I know I haven't always been the best wife.

30:59.443 --> 31:01.445
I'm really sorry.

31:01.611 --> 31:06.283
I get angry sometimes, and I made a mistake...

31:06.408 --> 31:07.451
Uh-uh. (SHUSHING)

31:07.576 --> 31:08.994
(SOFTLY) I made a terrible mistake.

31:26.136 --> 31:27.471
You're selling your virginity?

31:31.641 --> 31:33.185
I thought you'd be proud of me.

31:33.310 --> 31:34.311
Proud of you?

31:35.020 --> 31:37.564
Yeah, a lot of girls lose their virginity
for a lot less...

31:37.647 --> 31:38.815
So you're selling yourself?

31:38.940 --> 31:41.276
- At a worthy price! For a worthy cause!
- Okay, gentle tones, please.

31:41.359 --> 31:43.153
- Don't try and tell me...
- You know that is prostitution!

31:43.278 --> 31:45.030
- Women are exploited all the time!
- Hey let's just make sure

31:45.113 --> 31:46.990

Let's have a conversation.

- Dad.
- Come on!

- Where is it?
- You're being crazy!

31:58.835 --> 32:01.088
- No, you're not taking that.
- Are you serious?

32:01.171 --> 32:02.255
You're not taking that!

32:02.339 --> 32:04.091
- No, until you tell me or you shut it down.
- You two are...

Stop!

32:05.300 --> 32:07.427
- Stop it! Abby... Get off me.
- I'm not shutting it down!

Good night.

I'm going to get you some ice.

33:01.815 --> 33:03.567
You're lucky I didn't kill you.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.237
What did you say?

33:07.362 --> 33:09.156
You could've done permanent damage.

33:18.874 --> 33:21.251
So the spermatozoa fertilizes the egg.

33:21.334 --> 33:22.836
Women lay eggs?

33:22.919 --> 33:28.008
(CHUCKLES) No, women have eggs
inside of them, in their bellies.

33:28.091 --> 33:33.096
So the sperm fertilize the egg in there,
then out of that comes the baby.

33:33.221 --> 33:37.601
So you want a baby,
and my dad ferlitized you?

33:37.684 --> 33:39.895
-"Fertilize."
- Fertilized you?

33:41.104 --> 33:42.731
Something like that, yeah.

33:44.733 --> 33:47.194
What do you mean, "something like that"?

33:47.277 --> 33:50.238
Exactly like that. You're too smart for me.

Um, it'll just take a second. Please.

Listen, I think the idea
behind what you're doing,

34:58.014 --> 34:59.849

other ways to accomplish your goals.

Dad, come on.

A 16-year-old white girl from Monterey
selling her virginity online?

35:16.032 --> 35:17.867
Wolf Blitzer would saddle that up for weeks.

to care about everything.

40:19.502 --> 40:20.837
-(CHUCKLES)
-it feels so special, doesn't it?

40:20.962 --> 40:22.672
I just want to use all of them.

40:22.797 --> 40:24.674
The little ones are for the oysters.

40:24.757 --> 40:27.677
And I love these really creative little cups.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.262
- They're clay. I think they're from Mexico.
- Yeah.

40:29.345 --> 40:30.346
MADELINE: That's so nice.

40:30.471 --> 40:36.185
Ed prefers more traditional
glass cups for wine, but these are...

40:36.269 --> 40:38.104
I'm actually more kind of a beer guy, but...

40:38.187 --> 40:39.188
Oh, do you want some beer?

40:39.314 --> 40:40.356
- Oh, no, no, no.
- We have some.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.524
- Are you sure?
- Sit down.

40:41.649 --> 40:43.610
- You've done enough.
- And since we're talking about wineglasses,

40:43.693 --> 40:44.944
-let's have a toast!
- A toast.

40:45.028 --> 40:46.195
- Yes, toast.
- Toast.

40:46.988 --> 40:48.031
The, uh...

40:48.656 --> 40:49.949
To, um... For...

40:50.033 --> 40:53.202
- I should make a toast.
- BONNIE: Please.

40:53.328 --> 40:56.372
To Nathan and Bonnie.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.625
- Because I heard...
- And none of us killing each other.

40:58.708 --> 41:00.335
(LAUGHS) Yeah, right.

41:00.710 --> 41:02.879
-(LAUGHTER)
- I'm just kidding.

41:06.007 --> 41:07.634
This is yummy wine.

41:07.717 --> 41:09.719
- BONNIE: Mmm, is it?
-It's really good.

41:11.012 --> 41:12.972
Uh, is Abigail going to join us for dinner?

41:13.056 --> 41:14.807
She'll be down for dessert.

41:14.891 --> 41:17.560
She says she can only be stuck
with the grown-ups for so long.

41:17.644 --> 41:18.728
Yeah.

41:19.228 --> 41:21.397
I think she's just wanting us
to have some bonding time.

41:21.522 --> 41:24.567
Teenagers. Oh, she's probably working
on her secret project.

41:24.692 --> 41:25.902
Mmm.

41:26.027 --> 41:27.737
MADELINE: I'm so curious.

41:27.820 --> 41:30.073
- Do you guys know what that is?
- Mmm-hmm.

41:30.156 --> 41:31.866
Yeah, we just found out, what it is. Yeah.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.744
- No way.
- Do tell.

41:36.412 --> 41:38.081
Baby? (CLEARS THROAT)

41:38.331 --> 41:41.042
It's unconventional. It's even a little radical.

41:41.668 --> 41:42.919
Good.

41:43.044 --> 41:45.421
Listen, when I first heard about it,
I overreacted,

41:45.505 --> 41:49.258
and I just got to caution you guys
to take a breath, process it,

41:49.342 --> 41:51.260
before jumping to a judgment.

41:51.344 --> 41:53.262
MADELINE:
Okay, can you just tell us what it is?

41:53.388 --> 41:54.597
(CLEARS THROAT)

41:55.223 --> 41:56.349
us... (LAUGHS)

41:56.432 --> 41:58.768
Well, she's attempting to raise money
for Amnesty International.

41:58.893 --> 42:00.603
- All right.
- So she showed me her website.

42:00.728 --> 42:02.772
- It's like very professionally done.
- Website...

42:07.568 --> 42:08.611
L.-

42:08.736 --> 42:13.616
Abigail is auctioning off her virginity

42:13.741 --> 42:16.452
in order to raise money
to protest sex slavery.

42:17.370 --> 42:19.038
- What?
- Yes.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.248
(SCOFFS)

42:20.415 --> 42:21.791
- Very funny.
- No, I'm being serious.

42:22.750 --> 42:25.044
She said if a seven-year-old
can be sold into sex slavery,

42:25.128 --> 42:26.713
then no one would bat an eye

42:26.796 --> 42:29.966
if a white, rich American girl
would sell hers online.

42:31.300 --> 42:32.719
This is for real?

42:32.802 --> 42:34.470
Look, it's not gone live yet,

42:34.554 --> 42:36.639
and we have no intention
of letting that happen, obviously.

42:36.723 --> 42:39.726
You know, Nathan,
if this is some sort ofjoke...

42:39.809 --> 42:41.728
This is not funny, Nathan.

42:41.811 --> 42:47.316
Okay, it's shocking, and a bit disturbing,

42:47.442 --> 42:51.821
but I think it is important that we separate
the nobility of the cause

42:51.946 --> 42:54.323
from the misguided means
of pursuing it, you know?

42:55.283 --> 42:57.994
We champion the former
and dissuade her from the latter, right?

42:58.244 --> 42:59.996
-(RETCHES)
- ED: Oh, honey!

43:00.121 --> 43:02.248
- Are you okay?
- That's okay. That's okay. That's okay.

43:02.331 --> 43:03.499
I got it. I got it.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.169
That's a human reaction. That's completely...
Baby, get a...

43:06.294 --> 43:07.336
You okay, honey?

43:07.462 --> 43:09.005
No, I'm not.

43:09.130 --> 43:11.257
- Oh, my God.
- ED: Oh, honey.

43:11.340 --> 43:13.426
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

43:13.509 --> 43:14.844
That's all right. Here.

43:14.969 --> 43:16.179
That's all right.

43:16.304 --> 43:18.014
This is how you parent, Nathan?

43:18.097 --> 43:21.100
She's been under your roof for two minutes
and now she's some sort of prostitute?

43:21.184 --> 43:22.185
Did <i>I</i> tell you?

43:22.310 --> 43:24.687
- Great parenting!
- All right, let's all just settle for a minute.

43:24.771 --> 43:26.481
Okay? Please. Let's just settle.

43:27.607 --> 43:32.028
Let's remember that we are living in the time
of Facebook, and reality...

43:32.111 --> 43:33.362
Ugh... God damn it!

43:33.696 --> 43:35.615
- Oh, my...
- Shit.

43:35.698 --> 43:37.200
It's the shrimp.

43:37.283 --> 43:39.535
I'd heard that Abigail was a little slutty.

43:39.660 --> 43:41.871
Knowing the mother, I wouldn't be surprised.

43:42.038 --> 43:43.790
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

43:48.044 --> 43:49.837
'BYe,guys.
- Bye.

43:49.921 --> 43:50.963
Where are you going?

43:51.047 --> 43:52.882
Out for dinner with Jane.

43:53.257 --> 43:54.300
(SIGHS)

44:09.732 --> 44:11.067
That's enough.

44:12.485 --> 44:13.694
Abigail!

44:21.035 --> 44:22.286
You're done with dinner already?

44:22.370 --> 44:24.413
Look, I don't even know
where to begin about this,

44:24.497 --> 44:26.165
so I'm just going to go straight to the end.

44:26.249 --> 44:29.752
This is wrong, Abigail. Completely wrong.

44:30.211 --> 44:32.630
And I salute your cause. I really do.

44:32.713 --> 44:33.798
But what?

44:33.881 --> 44:36.300
Saluting a cause?
Recognizing a problem isn't enough.

44:36.384 --> 44:37.718
A person has to do something.

44:37.802 --> 44:40.221
Well, this something is not that, honey.

44:40.304 --> 44:41.430
What about your play?

44:41.514 --> 44:42.723
What about my play?

44:42.807 --> 44:45.226
You said it spoke to you
because it was about finding a purpose in life,

44:45.309 --> 44:46.352
which I get.

44:46.435 --> 44:48.437
Making your mark. I get that.

44:48.521 --> 44:51.315
You're the one who always said
a person's life needs to matter.

44:51.399 --> 44:52.984
- Okay.
- Was it all just bullshit?

44:53.067 --> 44:54.402
No, it's not.

44:54.485 --> 44:56.821
And I'm not going to give you
some long song-and-dance

44:56.904 --> 44:59.574
about how precious and sacred
your beautiful body is.

44:59.657 --> 45:03.327
- Mmm-hmm.
- But it is not for sale, Abigail. Not ever.

45:03.411 --> 45:06.330
No matter what cause, no matter what cost.

45:06.414 --> 45:08.249
And one day,
you're going to look back at this,

45:08.332 --> 45:10.001
probably pretty soon, and think,

45:10.084 --> 45:11.627
"What the fuck was I thinking?

45:11.711 --> 45:14.088
"Why was I going to fuck up my life like that?"

45:14.297 --> 45:16.757
(SCOFFS) Must be nice to be so right.

45:16.841 --> 45:19.010
- I'm not right!
- And so perfect.

45:19.093 --> 45:21.053
I'm not fucking perfect!

45:22.263 --> 45:25.141
You think you know me so well?
I fuck up, too!

45:26.058 --> 45:29.437
I make mistakes.
I've made mistakes bigger than this.

45:30.897 --> 45:31.939
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

45:35.776 --> 45:38.029
Last year I cheated on Ed.

45:40.114 --> 45:41.449
I ended it very quickly.

45:47.455 --> 45:52.835
And the two things I value most in this life
are my kids and my marriage,

45:52.919 --> 45:55.671
and I risked destroying both of them.

45:57.465 --> 46:02.136
Just because I was selfish, or...

46:03.804 --> 46:07.683
So tell me...
Don't tell me I'm perfect, okay?

46:09.101 --> 46:11.062
I know about fucking up.

46:13.648 --> 46:16.817
And fucking up doesn't make
your dad and I get back together.

46:18.736 --> 46:23.783
Fucking up doesn't fix your life, okay?

46:25.701 --> 46:29.580
At least what you were going to do
was for a good cause, and...

46:32.041 --> 46:34.251
I was just being selfish.

46:36.504 --> 46:37.880
Do you still love Ed?

47:00.987 --> 47:02.655
(TV PLAYING)

47:28.222 --> 47:30.725
