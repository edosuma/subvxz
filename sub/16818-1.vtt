02:50.000 --> 02:53.360
Try to imagine:
Colonel Gray's secretary.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.800
Unbelievable. A real Hoover.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.400
She's wanted my ass for months.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.200
Jody called in sick.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.360
- You're on desk duty.
- My ass.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.160
Stay on the radio.
The fog's a bitch tonight.

03:17.480 --> 03:20.960
I saw some activity at Fort Point.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.760
Patti Jean, give me a call
if you get cold.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.360
I got a jacket.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.960
- It's not the same as a man.
- Neither are you.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.720
Unit One Foxtrot is 10-8.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.960
Unit One Foxtrot to Dispatch 297.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.680
Scared away a couple of lovebirds.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.680
Judging by the car,
they could afford a motel room.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.600
- 10-4. Stay on the handset.
- Yes, Daddy.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.280
One Foxtrot to Dispatch 297.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.760
Checking an open door
at Officers' Club.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.040
Wait for Unit Two Bravo
to back you up.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.000
Stay where you are, Patti Jean.
Bud's leaving right now.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.240
Freeze!

06:17.560 --> 06:21.040
Presidio, this is Unit One Bravo.
I've had an accident.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.640
Suspect vehicle,
light-coloured Lincoln

06:23.680 --> 06:26.160
heading southbound
on Bernard from Presidio.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.360
He ran me off the road!
Sonofabitch!

06:30.600 --> 06:32.840
Shit! Hang on.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.640
We've got him! He's heading
for the Arguello Gate.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.840
Stay on the base, Zeke.
Don't pursue off base.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.640
SFPD will be notified.
They will respond.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.880
Do you read me?

06:48.080 --> 06:50.320
Zeke, answer me, damn it!

06:54.520 --> 06:55.960
We'll cut him off!

07:41.960 --> 07:45.160
- You all right?
- Yeah.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.600
Hey, scuzzball.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.840
What's this, plant food?

07:49.880 --> 07:53.160
Come on, Ace. That's not my stuff.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.680
- No?
- No.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.960
I borrowed this vest from a friend,
and it belongs to him.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.400
That's what it is.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.800
Is that right?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.720
All units. Possible 459.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.600
Lincoln eastbound on Lombard.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.720
Come on, Schmitty. Let's move.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.320
Hang in there, Leroy.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.760
Save this for me till we get back.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.040
- Gentlemen, this isn't legal.
- So sue us!

08:29.560 --> 08:33.919
We are in pursuit southbound
on Arguello from California,

08:33.960 --> 08:36.200
at speeds of over 70mph.

08:36.240 --> 08:40.200
Roger, Edward Five. All units
in the area, please respond.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.520
Edward Five, eastbound California.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.600
Roger, Edward Five.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.880
Austin.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.720
Yeah. Be right there.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.600
Howard, I'll give you
one more chance.

10:19.640 --> 10:23.120
- Who were you with?
- I don't know shit.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.400
You're too dumb
to have done this by yourself.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.600
Come in. When you were in the army,

10:29.640 --> 10:31.920
weren't you stationed
at the Presidio?

10:31.960 --> 10:32.960
Why?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.800
You're going to handle a shooting.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.520
Colonel Caldwell's in charge.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.120
Yeah. I know him. I don't like him.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.080
So? Don't take any shit.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.680
This doesn't look good for you.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.160
This'll be your third time down.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.280
Third time. Ooh. That's the big one.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.080
- Eat shit!
- You're wrong.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.840
I'm gonna be eating in restaurants.

10:56.880 --> 10:59.200
You'll be in the slam forever.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.640
Shit is what you'll be eating.
It's their best entrÃ©e!

11:05.560 --> 11:07.920
Howard is beginning to see the light.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.720
- You'll be OK. I'll get help.
- My heart!

11:15.760 --> 11:18.240
- Priest.
- What?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.320
Right there!

11:24.360 --> 11:27.320
You move, and I'll kill the cop!

11:27.360 --> 11:31.200
Take your gun out.
Drop it and kick it to me.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.520
Do it,
or I'll fucking blow him away!

11:36.560 --> 11:40.040
- Don't give him your gun.
- You want to die, cop?

11:40.080 --> 11:42.160
Nope. Do you?

11:43.800 --> 11:47.240
- Put the gun away.
- Give me the gun!

11:47.280 --> 11:49.200
Think about it, pal.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.520
You shoot me,
he's going to shoot you.

11:52.560 --> 11:56.320
No. Keep your eyes on me,
or I'll kill you.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.880
I'll do it!

11:57.920 --> 11:59.400
Either way, you're dead.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.600
- I'll shoot!
- You keep saying.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.520
You're not gonna do it.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.080
He's got his hand on his gun.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.680
It's not quite
working out right, huh?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.520
Live or die. Your choice.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.040
I need some help in here now!

12:37.640 --> 12:41.480
OK, everybody. Let's go.
Move back. Let's go.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.960
It doesn't concern you. Let's go.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
The show's over. Come on. Back.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.920
Zeke, how's it hanging?

12:52.960 --> 12:56.240
Austin. What in the hell
are you doing here?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.200
- No shit?
- No shit.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.520
You didn't steal that?

13:01.560 --> 13:05.320
What happened, some officer
shoot himself in the foot?

13:05.360 --> 13:09.040
It's Patti Jean.
She never had a chance.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.440
- I'm sorry, Jay.
- Is the old man inside?

13:13.320 --> 13:15.680
If there's anything I can do...?

13:32.680 --> 13:35.200
It's a kentia palm, sir.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.440
I don't care what it's called.
When did you last water it?

13:45.040 --> 13:48.080
Excuse me, Colonel,
should I type up my report?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.520
Who are you?

13:49.560 --> 13:52.400
John Mueller.
I manage the Officers' Club.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.840
You checked the inventory?

13:53.880 --> 13:57.200
Yes, but there's nothing
to steal, just supplies.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.560
No? Somebody wanted something
because they killed that girl.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.200
- Yes, sir.
- Don't call me sir.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.400
Anything missing?

14:05.440 --> 14:08.920
No, sir... I mean, no. Nothing.

14:08.960 --> 14:12.960
- The rear door's been jimmied.
- Yeah, I noticed that.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.120
My people will handle this now.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.400
- Don't you guys touch anything.
- Oh, really?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.760
Listen to me.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.400
We've got a multi-jurisdictional
investigation involving the army

14:29.440 --> 14:31.920
and the San Francisco Police
Department. That's me.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.480
CID still handles felonies,
don't they?

14:34.520 --> 14:36.840
So, unless I miss my guess,

14:36.880 --> 14:38.760
you're still the provost marshal.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.360
Sir.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.040
- Are you done?
- Maybe.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.640
Listen, boy.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.280
I was prepared to cut you some
slack because of Patti Jean.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.520
Well, your time's up,
so listen real good.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.840
This is my command here.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.360
You watch your mouth
when you're here.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.560
Or I might cut off your balls
and serve them for breakfast.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.120
- Do you understand me?
- Oh, yes, sir.

15:08.160 --> 15:09.920
Good.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.160
Mueller, did you water this plant?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.520
Say something.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.560
- What?
- That's a start.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.120
I'm Inspector Jay Austin,
San Francisco Police Department.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.560
- Who are you?
- You didn't do that right.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.120
You're supposed to show me your ID.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.600
Close the door.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.400
- What?
- Close the door.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.400
Hello. Inspector Austin,
San Francisco Police Department.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.160
I'm looking for Colonel Caldwell.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.120
He lives here.
He works somewhere else.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.920
I figured that.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.800
You wanna wait
on the porch, Inspector?

16:34.840 --> 16:36.760
No, I wanna come in.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.680
Donna Caldwell,
the colonel's daughter.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.640
You here about the MP
killed last night?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.640
The phone hasn't stopped ringing.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.040
Such a small post. No excitement.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.840
I know. I was an MP
under your father's command.

16:57.880 --> 17:02.920
- I never knew he had a daughter.
- Why did you leave the army?

17:02.960 --> 17:07.040
- I had my reasons.
- Was my father one of them?

17:07.079 --> 17:10.599
- Yeah.
- You're very pretty.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.000
- Is it hard?
- Is what hard?

17:18.720 --> 17:21.920
- Being a policeman.
- Oh, yeah.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.440
Inspector Austin,
are you flirting with me?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.280
I thought
it was the other way around.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.200
Your father will
tell you things about me.

17:32.240 --> 17:35.040
- What things?
- Nothing good.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.160
Are they true?

17:37.200 --> 17:40.040
Find out for yourself.
Want to have dinner tonight?

17:40.080 --> 17:44.600
- You don't waste time.
- How do I get hold of you?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.960
I should have made decaf.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.320
He'll be here any minute.
He's an intelligent guy.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.120
He'll see us talking
and figure out what's going on.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.760
- What?
- You're attracted to me.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.240
He'll be climbing the walls.
Later, when you're alone,

18:00.280 --> 18:03.760
he'll order you
to stay away from me.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.280
He won't. We have an agreement.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.440
- He'll break it.
- No. We made it when I was seven.

18:10.480 --> 18:15.120
- You were never seven. Free tonight?
- I'm a free woman.

18:15.160 --> 18:19.720
My card. My home address is on it.
Here's my phone number.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.000
Call me.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.280
You remember Jay Austin?

18:28.320 --> 18:30.880
Yeah. I remember.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
He remembers you.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.080
What are you doing in my house?

18:42.120 --> 18:45.320
Ballistics matched the weapon
used to kill the patrolman -

18:45.360 --> 18:48.200
the slugs match
the ones in Patti Jean.

18:48.240 --> 18:52.120
- So?
- They're from a Tokarev 33.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
So it's Russian.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.320
It's still a long way
to come for coffee.

18:58.360 --> 19:02.160
- What do you want?
- I thought you could help.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.040
My instincts tell me
it belongs to someone on the base.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.800
Your instincts suck.

19:08.840 --> 19:12.720
It could belong to a Russian.
They have a consulate, remember?

19:12.760 --> 19:16.240
Or it could be
a Vietnam veteran's war trophy.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.880
I'll ask you once more.
What do you want?

19:21.840 --> 19:25.240
I asked Sergeant Garfield
at the pistol range

19:25.280 --> 19:28.000
if anyone owned
a Tokarev on the base.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.000
He said there might be.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.920
When I asked for more information,

19:31.960 --> 19:36.200
he suddenly got amnesia
and threw red tape in my face.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.080
And you want me to talk to Garfield.

19:39.120 --> 19:42.440
You said you only
wanted to go through CID,

19:42.480 --> 19:45.240
and I was just a provost marshal.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.440
Tell you what. Forget it.

19:53.240 --> 19:54.240
Wait!

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Let's go.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.480
- Afternoon, sir.
- At ease, Sergeant.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.200
This is Inspector Austin,
San Francisco police.

20:21.240 --> 20:25.640
- I phoned about a Tokarev 33.
- Yeah.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.600
- You got one stored here?
- Nope.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.200
When we spoke, you mentioned
you might have some information.

20:33.240 --> 20:36.440
That's right, but you didn't ask
about information.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.640
You asked if the weapon
was stored here.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.280
This is fun.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.880
Yeah, I'm having fun.
Are you having fun?

20:43.920 --> 20:48.720
All right, what information
do you have about a Tokarev 33?

20:51.680 --> 20:55.320
I worked on one
for an officer, as a favour.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.400
It had a busted firing pin.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.960
I made him a new one
from tooled steel...

21:01.000 --> 21:02.360
His name?

21:04.960 --> 21:08.120
Godammit, forget him.
Face me. The name.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.600
- Colonel Lawrence.
- Paul Lawrence?

21:12.200 --> 21:13.760
You knew.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.720
You goddamn knew.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.960
That's all, Sergeant.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.320
Did I say something I shouldn't?

21:21.360 --> 21:24.160
- Let's talk to him.
- No way.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.760
I'll get a warrant.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.840
Just try to serve it
on a federal reservation.

21:29.880 --> 21:33.960
Since you got back here,
you've pissed on me like I'm a tree.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.320
You thought you didn't need me.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.960
So, suddenly it's different... No.

21:39.000 --> 21:43.880
If you want to talk to Colonel
Lawrence, you do it my way. OK?

21:43.920 --> 21:46.920
What happened between you two
was long ago.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.640
You were wrong then,
and you're wrong now.

21:49.680 --> 21:53.720
And if you want
to do anything with my help,

21:53.760 --> 21:56.200
you're going to do it the proper way.

21:56.240 --> 22:00.880
- You coming?
- I'll walk.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.400
.. Air Force academy as a freshman

22:11.440 --> 22:13.320
and decided to become a civilian.

22:13.360 --> 22:16.520
The bears on the one. Gilbert.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.800
There's MacDougal, going in motion.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.360
There's a hand-off,
a dive, and he doesn't get in.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.840
Who's winning?

22:28.880 --> 22:32.560
The bad guys, probably.
You're going out dressed like that?

22:32.600 --> 22:35.640
- Like what?
- You can see through that dress.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.720
- Why bother wearing one?
- There's a thought.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.520
Good night.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.120
You're going to see Austin,
aren't you?

22:45.720 --> 22:47.720
That's not a good idea.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.240
- He said you'd say that.
- Did he say why?

22:53.280 --> 22:56.680
- That's between you two.
- Don't get in the middle.

22:56.720 --> 23:01.440
- I don't tell you who to see.
- Of course you don't!

23:01.480 --> 23:03.520
I don't think I'd choose Myra,

23:03.560 --> 23:07.120
the redhead who makes you
breakfast on Thursday mornings.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.280
That's different.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.720
There are things you don't know.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.680
- He was an MP, I was his CO.
- He said.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.840
- He said a lot.
- Some.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.320
Don't be fooled.
He doesn't respect women.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.600
And you respect Myra enormously.
I certainly do!

23:25.640 --> 23:27.960
He'll use you to get at me.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.680
Gonna fight again?

23:33.240 --> 23:36.800
Look. I care what happens to you.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.960
I know that.
What is with you two anyway, huh?

23:41.000 --> 23:45.080
It happened two years ago.
You were away at school.

23:45.120 --> 23:49.480
- He and Patti were patrolling.
- The girl who was shot?

23:49.520 --> 23:53.520
They pulled over Paul Lawrence,
who was drunk, words were exchanged,

23:53.560 --> 23:55.600
- and Austin blew up.
- Blew up?

23:55.640 --> 23:58.280
He said Lawrence insulted the girl,

23:58.320 --> 24:01.000
so he beat him and put him in jail.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.840
And you went down
and took Lawrence home.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.720
Even if Lawrence had
insulted the girl,

24:06.760 --> 24:09.040
he can't justify beating him up.

24:09.080 --> 24:13.680
- Depends on the insult.
- He was out of line for an MP.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.760
You're defending someone
you don't know!

24:15.800 --> 24:20.040
- I'll find out about him.
- I don't want you seeing him.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.360
- Is that an order?
- Yes, it is.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.080
And what about our agreement?

24:30.680 --> 24:33.800
Yeah. He told me
you'd break that, too.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.640
Don't wait up for me. I'll be late.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.520
Shit on a stick.

24:55.440 --> 24:56.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.920
- Am I late?
- 10 minutes.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.720
10 minutes isn't late.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.880
In my house,
they'd call out a search party.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.760
You look great.

25:06.800 --> 25:11.600
- People say I look like my father.
- Christ, what a thought!

25:11.640 --> 25:14.760
- He knows where you are?
- Yeah.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.720
I got a question,
I need a straight answer.

25:17.760 --> 25:21.400
- It's all I got.
- Why'd you ask me to dinner?

25:21.440 --> 25:23.160
Why do you think?

25:23.200 --> 25:26.440
My father thinks you're using me.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.560
- And you?
- I'm not sure.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.440
Your father and I don't like
each other. That's no secret.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.000
There was an incident
at the Presidio.

25:35.040 --> 25:39.000
I busted a Colonel Lawrence, who
was drunk. I threw him in the tank.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.240
Did you beat him up first?

25:41.280 --> 25:45.840
Yeah, I told you your father
would tell you a lot of garbage.

25:45.880 --> 25:49.160
You also told me
to find out for myself.

25:49.200 --> 25:53.480
He resisted arrest,
then started on my partner, a woman.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.560
Oh. Were you involved
with your partner?

25:56.600 --> 26:00.240
She was my partner.
Lawrence took a swing at me, missed.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.080
I hit him - once.

26:02.120 --> 26:06.440
- Were you out of line?
- No way. He deserved it.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.480
And the sonofabitch demanded
they courtmartial me.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.640
So in walked your father.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.800
What a sight - not a wrinkle on him.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.080
He didn't want to know why.
He didn't care.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.800
"Why?" isn't in his book,
just "how much? When? What?"

26:22.840 --> 26:24.960
There was an officer involved.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.320
That's all that mattered,
not my word.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.880
I was just one of his men.

26:29.920 --> 26:33.080
You want to know
what the colonel did?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.560
Backed Lawrence.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.040
He walked. I lost a stripe.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.960
That's it. So I got out.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.400
I'm interested in you,
not your father.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.320
- Prove it.
- What?

26:51.360 --> 26:55.680
The way I see it,
we can do this two ways -

26:55.720 --> 27:00.320
we sit here and wonder
about being alone together...

27:01.720 --> 27:04.400
or just cut to the chase.

27:14.480 --> 27:18.400
- Pull across the street. Follow me.
- No. You follow me.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.600
You don't know where you're going.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.520
What are you doing?

28:56.120 --> 28:58.240
Gave me your address, remember?

29:55.880 --> 29:58.360
Oh, God.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.520
Come on.

32:02.840 --> 32:08.360
After school, I thought I'd move back
home until I figured out what I'd do.

32:08.400 --> 32:13.720
My father would be happy if I married
an officer and had a million kids.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.720
Would it make you happy?

32:18.480 --> 32:23.120
How about your mom?
She and your father get divorced?

32:25.800 --> 32:27.400
No.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.880
My mother killed herself
when I was two.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.160
I'm sorry.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.080
Where you going?

32:46.120 --> 32:48.320
I've gotta get back.

32:51.200 --> 32:55.160
- I want to see you again.
- I'll call you.

33:22.240 --> 33:26.040
You take it easy.
I'll do the talking, OK?

33:28.280 --> 33:31.160
Good morning, sir.
Colonel Lawrence is expecting you.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.640
Thank you.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.240
- Good to see you, Alan.
- Paul.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.600
What's he doing here?

33:38.640 --> 33:41.120
- What is this?
- It's official.

33:41.160 --> 33:44.640
- Where's the gun, asshole?
- You really are smooth.

33:44.680 --> 33:47.160
- Where's the Tokarev?
- Up yours!

33:47.200 --> 33:50.080
The gun is part
of a homicide investigation.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.040
I don't have to answer
his dipshit questions.

33:53.080 --> 33:57.320
Listen to me, Paul.
He can get a federal judge.

33:57.360 --> 34:00.720
- Let him.
- I don't want that.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.960
I'll check the gun
against those slugs.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.280
When they don't match I'll return it,
and this guy's gone forever.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.520
- I don't have it.
- Where is it?

34:11.560 --> 34:14.440
I lost it at poker two weeks ago.

34:16.040 --> 34:19.960
- To who?
- None of your business.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.239
- I'm making it my business.
- Get out of my office!

34:24.280 --> 34:27.000
Come on. I said come on.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.920
When you leave the Presidio
you'll be on my turf,

34:30.960 --> 34:33.040
and I'll haul your ass.

34:36.239 --> 34:40.760
I won't let you protect him again.
You understand what I'm saying?

34:40.800 --> 34:43.920
I'm impressed. You handled that
really professionally!

34:43.960 --> 34:47.239
You keep covering for him,
we'll have serious problems.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.520
Even with a head as empty as yours,

34:49.560 --> 34:54.000
an occasional thought
must creep in sometimes.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.800
Like maybe we don't need the gun.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.960
Maybe we already have a bullet.

35:04.640 --> 35:08.200
Careful, don't try too much.
You might pull something.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.880
- Afternoon, sir.
- At ease, Sergeant.

35:11.920 --> 35:16.320
When you repaired Colonel Lawrence's
Tokarev, did you test it?

35:16.360 --> 35:19.320
Yes, sir. I capped it
several times, Colonel.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.960
Any chance you'd have the slugs?

35:22.000 --> 35:25.520
They should be in the bottom
of that barrel.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.200
It should be easy to spot.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.760
A Tokarev's only a 7.62 millimetre.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.000
Should stick out like a sore thumb

35:34.040 --> 35:37.920
against all these.45s
and 9 millimetres.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.960
Here's one here.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.040
This came from
Colonel Lawrence's Tokarev.

35:47.640 --> 35:49.640
Thank you, Sergeant.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.560
If this matches the slug
taken from my MP and your cop,

35:53.600 --> 35:56.360
I want your word
that you'll go through me.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.800
- Sure.
- There's more.

35:58.840 --> 36:03.680
If it doesn't match, get off
Lawrence's back and stay off it.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.680
Take it or leave it.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.600
Deal.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.720
Guy named Peale called yesterday,
reported his Lincoln stolen.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.080
Tough guy to see. Heavy money.

36:16.120 --> 36:19.720
- So?
- I won't ask you to come.

36:19.760 --> 36:24.120
Probably wouldn't like it if you did.
But if you want to, it's OK.

36:25.120 --> 36:28.000
You're all charm and grace, boy.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.200
Pick me up at the museum.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.600
More American soldiers died
in the civil war than any other.

36:39.640 --> 36:43.120
- How come?
- Both sides were American.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.160
That's kind of lame.

36:45.200 --> 36:49.520
This flag was at Fort Sumter
when the war started.

36:49.560 --> 36:53.320
- What's this?
- Never mind. Come back over here.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.800
Get him to tell you what it is.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.960
Don't listen.
He's mentally incompetent.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.880
That's the medal of honour,
our highest award.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.320
Did you let that man in?

37:03.360 --> 37:06.240
Look closely at that photograph.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.200
That man is Lyndon Johnson.
He was President.

37:09.240 --> 37:11.320
That soldier won that medal.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.360
Doesn't this place have security?

37:13.400 --> 37:17.440
- Just anyone can walk in here?
- Doesn't that soldier look familiar?

37:17.480 --> 37:20.400
He wasn't nearly as ugly then.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.400
Holy shit!

37:22.440 --> 37:25.240
That relic there
is Sergeant Major Maclure.

37:25.280 --> 37:29.520
- Ask how he won the medal.
- How old are you?

37:29.560 --> 37:31.320
- Eight.
- Wanna be nine?

37:31.360 --> 37:36.720
It wasn't for charm.
He won it in Vietnam. In the jungle.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.280
When he was separated from his unit,

37:39.320 --> 37:43.360
he found this wounded officer
who was close to dying,

37:43.400 --> 37:45.040
so he picked him up.

37:45.080 --> 37:48.280
As he carried him towards
the American lines,

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
he met an enemy group.

37:50.360 --> 37:54.000
They were set up to ambush
an American patrol,

37:54.040 --> 37:56.480
so he put down the officer,

37:56.520 --> 38:01.960
and with one M-16 and a few hand
grenades, he attacked them.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.040
He was one man against 50.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.520
- 50?
- He wiped them out.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.520
And despite being wounded,

38:09.560 --> 38:12.640
he got the officer,
and carried him to safety.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.600
- What's that gun?
- A.45

38:15.640 --> 38:18.320
The officer gave him it
for saving his life.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.360
- What's Vietnam?
- A place where we fought a war.

38:22.880 --> 38:26.280
- I never heard of it.
- Well, it happened.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.080
Did we kick ass?

38:28.120 --> 38:33.120
I want you all to thank the Sergeant
Major for giving us this tour.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.760
Thank you, Sergeant Major.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.560
You guys come back anytime, huh?

38:44.840 --> 38:47.000
Did we kick ass?

38:47.040 --> 38:50.640
- Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.120
I should've left
your Scotch ass there.

38:53.160 --> 38:57.120
Scotch is a drink. A man born
in Scotland is a Scotsman.

38:57.160 --> 39:01.080
Next time you're dying
in the boonies, call a cab.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.240
Still worried about Donna?

39:03.280 --> 39:06.680
We can't have a conversation
without blowing our tops.

39:06.720 --> 39:11.400
She's not a little girl any more.
Maybe you don't want her to grow up.

39:11.440 --> 39:14.760
She's seeing Jay Austin.
Remember him?

39:14.800 --> 39:17.600
The MP who threw Lawrence
into the pokey?

39:17.640 --> 39:21.200
I never did like Lawrence.
He's a monkey dick.

39:21.240 --> 39:25.160
You're a big help.
Austin's a cop now.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.040
That female MP that was killed?

39:28.120 --> 39:31.680
She was with Austin
when they busted Lawrence.

39:31.720 --> 39:35.680
The thought of bringing down Lawrence
is giving Austin a hard-on.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.520
- Is Lawrence involved?
- I don't know.

39:38.560 --> 39:42.440
The weapon was a Tokarev.
Lawrence says he lost his at poker.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.440
Did he?

39:44.480 --> 39:48.920
- Lawrence isn't talking.
- So maybe Austin's right.

39:48.960 --> 39:52.920
- I don't want her seeing him.
- It ain't up to you.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.640
She's only seeing him
because I don't want her to.

39:56.680 --> 40:01.560
- Say you like him. she might stop.
- He's wrong for her.

40:01.600 --> 40:05.680
Would you listen if someone
told you not to see somebody?

40:05.720 --> 40:07.520
That's different.

40:07.560 --> 40:11.520
Sure. Maybe you see a little
of yourself in him.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.360
What do you mean?

40:13.400 --> 40:17.840
I remember seeing this 90-day wonder
with an order manual in his pocket.

40:17.880 --> 40:22.760
I said to myself, "The Army's
finally found a way to screw me."

40:22.800 --> 40:27.120
But you didn't turn out so bad.
It took a little time.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.520
Maybe Austin needs a little time.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.200
- Anybody home?
- Yeah. Over here.

40:32.240 --> 40:36.320
- Hey, top. How you doing?
- Oh, still kicking.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.920
- Still got a big mouth?
- I guess so.

40:39.960 --> 40:41.840
Figures.

40:41.880 --> 40:42.840
Just a little time.

40:49.880 --> 40:51.840
Mr Peale will see you.

40:53.840 --> 40:57.880
- This is Inspector Austin, Mr Peale.
- Jay Austin.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.040
Colonel Caldwell,
Presidio Provost Marshal.

41:00.080 --> 41:01.600
I'm Arthur Peale.

41:01.640 --> 41:03.920
Can I get you guys something?
Beer, coffee?

41:03.960 --> 41:07.280
- No, thanks.
- This is my assistant Mark Wallach.

41:07.320 --> 41:10.560
- Pleasure.
- Coffee for me, Mark.

41:10.600 --> 41:13.200
How can I help you?

41:13.240 --> 41:15.840
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

41:15.880 --> 41:19.640
I assume it's about my car.
Have you located it?

41:19.680 --> 41:23.800
Your Lincoln was involved
in a homicide Tuesday morning.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.160
The one
on the Chronicle's front page?

41:26.200 --> 41:29.520
- Afraid so.
- Mark, did you hear that?

41:29.560 --> 41:32.040
The Lincoln was involved
in a shooting.

41:32.080 --> 41:35.600
- You're kidding.
- When did you last use the car?

41:35.640 --> 41:39.440
It's my wife's.
We went out to dinner.

41:39.480 --> 41:43.440
I left it here and drove home.
Next morning, it was gone.

41:43.480 --> 41:46.440
- What is Transcorp?
- We're a holding company.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.440
Fairly diversified at the moment.

41:48.480 --> 41:52.480
Jewellery stores,
shopping centres, that sort of thing.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.640
Which restaurant did you visit?

41:54.680 --> 41:57.920
Jake's. Seafood place on Broadway.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.960
- How far away?
- Thanks, Mr Peale.

42:02.040 --> 42:06.240
Your car's being printed
and processed.

42:06.280 --> 42:09.080
You'll probably get it back
inside 90 days.

42:09.120 --> 42:13.040
Forget it, I just hope you find
whoever shot those people.

42:13.080 --> 42:15.000
Thank you.

42:16.160 --> 42:20.600
Why were you in such a hurry?
Late for a hairdressing appointment?

42:20.640 --> 42:23.600
You're the one who's real big
on jurisdictions.

42:23.640 --> 42:27.880
This is my jurisdiction.
I was conducting an investigation.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.640
That was an investigation?!
"Sorry to trouble you,

42:31.680 --> 42:36.000
"but your car was used in a homicide.
We're really sorry."

42:36.040 --> 42:39.080
This may be hard
for you to understand.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.520
You're not in command.

42:40.560 --> 42:44.120
You were in such a rush
you didn't see what was on the table.

42:44.160 --> 42:48.480
I put Peale through R&I,
checked him up, down, sideways...

42:48.520 --> 42:51.080
I don't like him, but he's clean.

42:54.760 --> 42:58.160
OK. Where's the report
on the Tokarev slug?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.720
- Couple of hours.
- Good.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.440
Come on. I'll buy you some coffee.

43:03.480 --> 43:05.520
Are you kidding?

43:06.560 --> 43:09.040
No. No, I'm not kidding.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.200
I want to talk to you about Donna.

43:28.240 --> 43:31.520
Are you going to ask me
my intentions?

43:31.560 --> 43:34.080
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

43:34.120 --> 43:38.200
- You really are a piece of work.
- What's so funny?

43:38.240 --> 43:40.320
How's it hanging, Major?

43:43.000 --> 43:46.880
- Wanna leave?
- No. After my coffee.

43:46.920 --> 43:49.600
- So...
- Come on, Major.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.600
I'm talking to you.

43:53.240 --> 43:57.240
- Let it alone, boy.
- Excuse me, Major?

43:58.280 --> 44:02.320
- I said let it alone.
- Did I hear the Major right?

44:03.320 --> 44:06.040
Did he give ME an order?

44:08.600 --> 44:10.640
You stink, Major.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.440
What is that smell anyway, mothballs?

44:20.240 --> 44:22.760
What are you going to do now, Major?

44:27.280 --> 44:31.280
Are you sure you want a fight?
I'll only use my thumb.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.880
- Thumb?
- My right thumb.

44:33.920 --> 44:36.160
Left one's too powerful for you.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.000
Come on!

44:43.760 --> 44:44.760
Guys...

44:45.840 --> 44:47.800
Keep it fair.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.120
- Get up, man!
- Come on!

45:08.040 --> 45:10.280
I'll get him!

45:33.320 --> 45:36.720
You see these little oak leaves?
They're silver.

45:36.760 --> 45:39.080
That means I'm a lieutenant colonel.

45:39.120 --> 45:42.720
If they were gold,
I'd be a major, understand?

45:42.760 --> 45:45.680
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.

45:45.720 --> 45:50.920
Next time you see an army officer,
you'll recognise his rank,

45:50.960 --> 45:53.720
and he won't accidentally hurt you.

45:53.760 --> 45:56.360
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.720
- Thank you.
- About your daughter, sir,

46:06.760 --> 46:10.120
I want you to know my intentions
are strictly honourable.

46:13.960 --> 46:15.440
I love this place.

46:15.480 --> 46:18.240
Soldiers from all wars
trade lies with each other.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.560
Soldiers should rest together.
They earned their peace.

46:21.600 --> 46:24.800
I got a spot picked out for myself.

46:24.840 --> 46:29.040
They closed the cemetery in 1962,
but I've got special permission.

46:29.080 --> 46:32.440
I'm next to a corporal
from the Spanish-American war.

46:32.480 --> 46:34.800
Boy, are we gonna trade stories.

46:34.840 --> 46:39.800
I'm going to say, "Listen, Corporal,
"stop telling me about those cannons.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.880
"In 'Nam, we had Claymores, AK-47s.

46:42.920 --> 46:45.240
"Now, they were real weapons."

46:46.000 --> 46:50.480
- Dad told you to talk to me.
- No. It was my idea.

46:50.520 --> 46:53.840
You two been going
15 rounds every day?

46:53.880 --> 46:56.800
Yeah. It's like talking
to a brick wall.

46:56.840 --> 47:01.720
He can be a stubborn son of a bitch.
You can't, right?!

47:01.760 --> 47:05.680
- You like this kid Austin?
- Yeah, I do.

47:05.720 --> 47:08.080
We've been seeing each other a lot.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.960
Not just to piss your old man off?

47:11.000 --> 47:15.560
Maybe in the beginning.
He wants me to marry Captain Gordon.

47:15.600 --> 47:17.920
- That what you want?
- No!

47:17.960 --> 47:22.480
- Let HIM marry Captain Gordon.
- That's what I told him.

47:22.520 --> 47:27.120
This guy's different, though.
He's just...scares me.

47:27.160 --> 47:29.720
- Why?
- I don't know.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.120
He just...gets too close.

47:32.160 --> 47:35.840
You're not afraid of HIM,
you're afraid of YOU.

47:35.880 --> 47:40.000
- I'm ugly, but I'm not stupid.
- I think you're gorgeous.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.960
Afternoon, Colonel.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.080
- You have the storeroom key?
- Yes, sir.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.120
Yeah.

49:05.480 --> 49:08.560
Is this about what I think,
you sonofabitch?

49:08.600 --> 49:10.720
That package you wanted located?

49:10.760 --> 49:15.000
I found it. It's in Chinatown,
1412 Washington.

49:15.040 --> 49:18.440
- Hurry. It won't be there long.
- Thanks.

49:49.760 --> 49:52.080
- Surprise!
- You can't arrest me.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.280
Wrong. You're in the real world.

49:54.320 --> 49:58.120
You're not a colonel,
asshole, and I own you.

49:58.160 --> 50:03.000
- You can't do it.
- Guess what? I got a warrant.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.600
I got a slug from your Tokarev,
a ballistics match,

50:06.640 --> 50:09.640
saying it's the one
that killed Patti Jean.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.760
You know what I'd like?

50:11.800 --> 50:16.200
I'd like you to resist arrest...
just a little.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.720
God, I'd really like that.

50:17.760 --> 50:20.160
You have the right
to remain silent...

50:40.040 --> 50:41.840
Get out of here!

52:25.560 --> 52:27.160
Shit!

52:56.200 --> 52:59.040
You were supposed to go through me.
You gave me your word.

52:59.080 --> 53:02.640
- He ran. I chased him.
- You gave me your word.

53:02.680 --> 53:06.640
I got a ballistics match
and a clean bust. He did it.

53:06.680 --> 53:10.200
- You realise what you've done?
- Caught the killer.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.600
Can you prove he pulled the trigger?

53:12.640 --> 53:14.600
He proved it...by running.

53:14.640 --> 53:18.040
Can you tell me why he broke
into the Officers' Club?

53:18.080 --> 53:20.040
Lawrence sure as shit can't!

53:20.080 --> 53:24.160
You made a clean bust all right!
You're a real prize.

53:24.200 --> 53:27.960
You're wrong about Lawrence.
He's part of all this.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.720
I wasn't wrong about him.
The truth is, I never liked him.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.400
Then why didn't you back me?

53:35.440 --> 53:39.280
You broke the law!
You're the cop, he's the bad guy.

53:39.320 --> 53:42.040
You still don't get it, do you?

53:42.640 --> 53:47.440
Do you think Lawrence is the
only one involved in all this?

53:47.480 --> 53:51.240
I tried to tell you
after we left Peale's office -

53:51.280 --> 53:54.080
about the coasters on his table?

53:54.120 --> 53:55.880
Coasters?

53:55.920 --> 53:58.960
Yeah. From the Caravelle Bar
in Saigon.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.840
- You checked him.
- He was clean.

54:01.880 --> 54:06.080
If there's no conviction, he's clean!
Did you check his service record?

54:06.120 --> 54:09.640
- He never served.
- He's got Vietnam souvenirs.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.240
No, he collects coasters!

54:11.280 --> 54:14.440
I ran a check myself
through my people.

54:14.480 --> 54:19.000
Peale was CIA. He was
a province advisor in Long Binh

54:19.040 --> 54:21.960
at the same time
as Lawrence was there.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.400
- They knew each other?
- What do you think?

54:25.440 --> 54:26.920
How would I know?

54:26.960 --> 54:30.680
That's classified military shit!
How could I find that out?

54:35.080 --> 54:39.320
All I know is whoever broke into
the storeroom wanted something bad.

54:46.240 --> 54:48.720
Oh, Christ! The water.

54:49.480 --> 54:52.160
One plant had water.
The rest were dry.

54:52.200 --> 54:55.520
There was an empty bottle
that Mueller never opened.

54:55.560 --> 54:58.800
- What about Mueller?
- He's got an alibi.

54:58.840 --> 55:01.760
Anyway, why break in? He's got a key.

55:01.800 --> 55:05.480
I have the address
of the water company.

55:05.520 --> 55:09.440
- They open at 0900.
- Pick you up at your quarters, 8:30.

55:14.120 --> 55:16.040
Listen, I was...

55:33.200 --> 55:36.360
- Follow my lead, OK?
- No, it's not OK.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.320
How are you handling it?

55:38.360 --> 55:41.280
We don't want to tip anybody off.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.560
Hey, I'm good at this.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.600
- Hi.
- All right!

55:51.640 --> 55:53.520
I'm looking for the dispatcher.

55:53.560 --> 55:56.440
You found her, man.
Her name is Gloria.

55:56.480 --> 55:57.640
Gloria.

55:57.680 --> 56:02.560
- You follow the Dead?
- Everywhere, man. You, too?

56:02.600 --> 56:05.480
Yeah. First time I saw them
was '73 at Winterland.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.520
Flipped me right out.
Been a fan ever since.

56:08.560 --> 56:12.360
- Intense!
- Did you do Oakland, New Year?

56:12.400 --> 56:15.680
All six shows.
I slept in the parking lot.

56:15.720 --> 56:18.680
- It was mellow.
- How many you seen?

56:18.720 --> 56:20.440
Anaheim was 179.

56:20.480 --> 56:23.240
My boyfriend hasn't missed one
for four years.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.240
I can't do that because of work.

56:25.280 --> 56:29.360
His old man's got money.
Work's such a drag, you know?

56:30.480 --> 56:32.640
Who's General Washington?

56:32.680 --> 56:35.200
- My father.
- Bummer!

56:35.240 --> 56:38.040
- Tell me!
- He into elevator music?

56:38.080 --> 56:40.280
What do you think?

56:40.320 --> 56:43.240
Gloria, this is kind
of embarrassing, you know,

56:43.280 --> 56:46.080
but last week I borrowed
my father's car.

56:46.120 --> 56:49.480
Parked it outside the
Officers' Club at the Presidio,

56:49.520 --> 56:51.480
and someone banged into it.

56:51.520 --> 56:55.680
I remembered seeing one of your
delivery trucks making a delivery.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.680
Maybe the driver saw something?

56:57.720 --> 57:01.320
He doesn't believe me.
He thinks I did it.

57:01.360 --> 57:05.080
- He never believes you, right?
- Yours any different?

57:05.120 --> 57:07.400
You never heard it from me.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.840
Officers' Club at the Presidio?

57:12.960 --> 57:17.320
Deliveries are every Tuesday.
Driver's name is Spota.

57:17.360 --> 57:21.480
- He working today?
- Day off. He's in tomorrow, 8:30.

57:21.520 --> 57:23.040
- First name?
- You?

57:23.080 --> 57:26.480
- Jay.
- First name George.

57:26.520 --> 57:28.960
I like yours better.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.960
Do you think you could give me
his home address?

57:33.000 --> 57:35.760
- No hassles.
- I don't know, man.

57:35.800 --> 57:39.800
Look at him. Does he look like
he'd wait until tomorrow?

57:43.440 --> 57:47.240
732 Vermont.
You never heard it from me.

57:47.280 --> 57:49.960
God, thanks.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.560
- Can I send you something here?
- Sure.

57:53.600 --> 57:59.120
I've got a bootleg copy
of the Dylan concert at Meadowlands.

57:59.160 --> 58:00.920
I'll send you a copy.

58:00.960 --> 58:05.040
- I don't know what to say, man.
- Just say thanks.

58:05.080 --> 58:08.040
Us Deadheads got to stick together.

58:08.080 --> 58:10.280
Later.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.200
- Hey, General.
- Colonel!

58:12.240 --> 58:14.520
You really ought to lighten up.

58:17.480 --> 58:19.480
I'll try.

58:24.480 --> 58:29.400
The guy who delivers water
to the Officers' Club is named Spota.

58:29.440 --> 58:32.880
- George Spota?
- Yeah. How did you know that?

58:32.920 --> 58:37.160
A Master Sergeant Spota
served under Lawrence in Long Binh.

58:37.200 --> 58:38.680
Maybe the same guy.

58:38.720 --> 58:42.800
Anyway, he's off today,
but he's back on tomorrow at 8:30.

58:42.840 --> 58:47.560
Water was delivered to the Presidio
the same day Patti Jean was killed.

58:47.600 --> 58:51.440
- What in the hell's the Dead?
- You wouldn't understand.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.120
Try me.

58:54.440 --> 58:57.240
- The Grateful Dead.
- The Grateful Dead?

58:57.280 --> 58:59.960
- Grateful Dead.
- I don't understand.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.080
That's a surprise.

59:01.120 --> 59:04.680
There's something
I want to check out.

59:04.720 --> 59:07.120
- What?
- I'll tell you tomorrow.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.720
There's something
I need to check, too.

59:09.760 --> 59:11.040
Tomorrow.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.960
I hated it, though.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.960
Whenever I'd make a friend,

59:17.000 --> 59:21.000
Dad would get orders
to leave and I'd say goodbye.

59:21.040 --> 59:24.160
I got to see a lot of great places.

59:24.200 --> 59:26.080
Leavenworth, Kansas.

59:26.120 --> 59:28.520
Always so special
during the summer.

59:28.560 --> 59:31.320
And who could forget
Christmas at Fort Bragg?

59:32.960 --> 59:36.960
What is going on in there?
What are you thinking about?

59:40.120 --> 59:43.320
Is what we've been doing
enough for you, Donna?

59:43.360 --> 59:45.880
What do you mean?

59:45.920 --> 59:50.360
I don't know how to say this
so I'll just say it.

59:50.400 --> 59:54.400
What we've been doing
has been...great.

59:54.440 --> 59:58.120
It's been...games?

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.640
It's crazy 'cause
this should be perfect for me.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.800
What I'm trying to tell you is,
I really care about you.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.600
I'm just having trouble
saying it, that's all.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.480
Gareth Wooten, please.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.080
Wooten. Alan Caldwell here.

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.920
Fine. How are things at Langley?

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.680
Careful, you'll get a sore ass
sitting at a desk.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.200
I need a favour.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.120
There's a holding company
out here called Transcorp.

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.760
T-R-A-N... I know you can spell!

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.000
Push one of your buttons and
tell me what companies they own.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.440
Thank you. I do appreciate it.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.880
Oh, and give my love to Linda.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.920
No. No, we're not even.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.640
Just tell her she made a mistake.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.640
I'm still much better-looking!
Goodbye.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.720
- Can we leave now?
- I just ordered this drink.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.240
- Please can we go?
- May I have this dance?

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.840
Give it a rest.

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.000
Captain Gordon...
Inspector Austin. He's a policeman.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.600
- You're being very impolite, Jay.
- You don't like it here?

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.000
- No, I don't, dickhead.
- What did you say?

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.640
Why are you doing this?

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.280
- I won't do this.
- I asked you a question!

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.720
Yeah, I heard you.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.400
You push it, don't you?
Right up to the edge.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.400
Let's step outside.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.640
You want me to fight this jerk
for your hand?

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.640
You want to settle this
like gentlemen?

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.760
- However you like.
- Marquis of Queensberry rules.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.680
There! That what you wanted to see?

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.160
Easy, Colonel. I'm done.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.280
Whatever my intentions were,
you can forget them.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.080
She's dangerous.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.640
You really are something.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.160
Why did you bring him there
in the first place?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.160
Why not just throw in a hand grenade?
It's quicker.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.400
- Leave me alone.
- Are you proud of yourself?

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.040
Ask yourself that question.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.200
- What?
- You set it up, not me.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.200
What are you talking about?

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.400
Who I can or can't see.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.000
You probably have
it all written down.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.200
You never ask me what I want.
You always tell me.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.800
I've news for you,
I didn't enlist in your army.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.040
- I decide what I do.
- You're doing a wonderful job.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.600
Without help from you, sir,
just rules.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.720
You decide what's fair or foul.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.640
- This is ridiculous.
- Don't turn your back.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.320
- I won't stand your rubbish.
- That's perfect.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.920
You're done talking
so there's nothing else to say.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.560
- Right.
- You coward.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:25.040
- That's enough.
- No, it's never enough.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.000
What are you afraid of?

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.680
- You think I'm like her?
- Stop.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.680
You turned your back on her,
didn't you?

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.520
- Stop!
- Bastard, it was your fault!

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.120
Do it.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:22.520
Colonel... Jesus!
What the hell are you doing?

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.040
Getting drunk.
What does it look like?

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.520
- Looks like you've done that.
- I'm going to get drunker.

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.960
I'm going up on the roof.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.160
- Why?
- Your windowsill hurts.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.160
- Why not come inside?
- Because I'm outside.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:42.480
- You know what time it is?
- Who cares?

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.600
Well, I sure don't.

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:01.720
- Drink this all by yourself?
- Yeah.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.760
- You can keep that one.
- Thanks.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.280
- I've lost her.
- Who?

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.200
Donna.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.360
You didn't lose her.
She's just grown up.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.800
- You got to accept that.
- Oh, yeah? She hates me.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.720
No, she's trying
to measure up to you.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:31.000
Sometimes that ain't easy.
You want perfection in people.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.800
There's not a lot of perfect around.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:38.240
- You know how much I love her?
- Yeah, I know.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.520
But it's important what SHE knows.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.400
When was the last time you told her?

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.960
She knows.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.280
I've known buildings
easier to talk to than you.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.920
Hey, was that my gun
you pointed at me?

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.120
Yeah. I took it out of the museum.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.640
- Why?
- Just wanted to hold it for a while.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.440
Well, what for?

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.680
I had my reasons.
Give me some of that.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.840
Sometimes I think it was easier
winning that medal than wearing it.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.720
Think anyone gives a shit about us?

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:27.640
We give a shit about them.
That's what matters.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.359
You know what I think?

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:35.240
I think America is like a big,
fancy house...

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.359
and we're the Doberman pinschers.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.680
- Doberman pinschers?
- A guy hears a noise downstairs,

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.600
he's really happy
to have his big, ugly dog, huh?

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.000
But...

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:55.600
the next day when his friends
come around, he locks up the dog.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:59.560
Why? 'Cause he's embarrassed.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:05.359
But that night, he unlocks the dog
to protect his fancy house.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:08.600
If some guy comes
and the dog doesn't bite his ass,

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.960
he's gonna smack him
in the fucking mouth.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.680
Yeah, it's like that.

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:21.600
I'll tell you something else -

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:25.279
and I remember this
like it was yesterday -

01:09:25.319 --> 01:09:30.439
when I was 10, my old man was laid
off again, comes home and says,

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:33.840
"We're leaving Scotland.
We're going to America,"

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.680
and gives me this book
by Thomas Jefferson.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.800
I read it all. Next thing,
I'm on the deck of this ship.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:46.240
My old man shouts,
"Look, there she is."

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:50.640
I could just see over the guard rail.
It's the Statue of Liberty.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:55.200
And I look, and that green
colour on her face.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:59.600
You know,
she really is that beautiful.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.480
Anyway, that's how I see America.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.360
Yeah. And that's why I'm a soldier.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.920
We don't have to have thanks
from anybody,

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.000
because it's... That's not important.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:20.960
Or this.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.680
Sergeant Major...

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.280
- I'm really drunk.
- As a skunk!

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.520
The look on his face
said he was scared.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.840
I never saw that before.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.800
My whole life, he's taught me

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.360
to never say too much.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.360
Don't show too much.
Never lose control.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.400
That works,

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.800
because nobody can hurt you
if you don't let anybody in.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:03.360
I have to give him credit.
He really taught me that well.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:08.120
He even tries to keep me away,
and that is what hurts.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.920
And that's what
I've been doing to you.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.960
Go on.

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.240
So I've been trying
not to lose control.

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:25.800
I could sleep with you,
as long as it was on my terms.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.560
I was doing OK that way,
I really was.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.360
Except the more time
I spent with you...

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.080
the scarier it got.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.960
That's why I behaved that way
at the Officers' Club.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.720
I couldn't run away
from you any more.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.680
I wanted you to run away from me.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.360
I don't want to hurt you
like that any more.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.720
Because...

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.440
because I love you.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.240
You're 10 minutes late.

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.960
Got some good news and some bad news.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.280
- Oh. What's the good news?
- Donna's with me.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:57.680
That's good news?

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.600
- The bad news is, I love her.
- So do I.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.000
Shall we discuss
my personal life all morning?

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.000
- Nope.
- Good.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.160
The car that killed Lawrence
is registered to Spota.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.160
Arthur Peale owns
the Black Mountain Water Company.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.600
He's in the second truck. Number 68.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:10.400
- Recognise him?
- Yeah. That's Sergeant Spota.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.720
In front of everybody.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:11.760
Always the most successful way.
None of that covert shit.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:20.520
Captain, where did you
just come in from?

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.600
A contract flight from Clark, sir.

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:24.200
The Philippines?

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.360
Yeah. Clark Air Force base, Colonel.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.560
- Come on. He's leaving.
- Thank you.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.600
- What's with the Philippines?
- I don't know. Something.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.680
Why water from the Philippines?

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.880
There's something in that bottle
worth killing for.

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.800
Water from the Philippines
is delivered to Spota.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.720
Spota delivers it
to the bottling company.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.760
Except he makes a mistake.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.960
He delivers the wrong bottle
to the Officers' Club.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
When he realises what he's done
he comes back here.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.920
Patti Jean surprises him,
and he smokes her.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.880
I wanna know what's in that bottle.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.880
What's with you?

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.360
Nah, there's a piece missing.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:31.120
Something about the Philippines.
There's another hand in this.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.760
There's a piece missing.

01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.760
Peale, Lawrence, Spota...
they knew each other in Vietnam.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.160
They're all in it. What's missing?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:31.560
Oh, shit!

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.560
He served with Lawrence in Vietnam.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.960
They'd have to use him
or somebody like him.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.760
He knows every maintenance man
in the Orient.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.440
Everybody's gone. We're secure.

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.560
These are good quality.
Our friend in Manila's done well.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.840
Tell him he's stopping now.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.320
- Why are you here?
- You said no one would be hurt.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.200
- No one was supposed to.
- What about the girl?

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.800
- Lawrence has been dealt with.
- That's not enough. It's over.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.360
Too late for a conscience.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.880
- It's over.
- Who are you?

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.080
The infantry.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:39.080
The war's long over, old man.
Nobody cares.

01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:42.840
Go back to your museum
and play soldier.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:47.280
You open your mouth again,
I'll shove your head up your ass.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.360
Where are you going?

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.640
Goddammit! Sonofabitch!

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.200
This is ridiculous.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:01.240
I'm sure that we can reach
some understanding.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:04.800
Look, Sergeant, we're already
sorry for what's happened,

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.320
but there's nothing
we can do about it.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.600
You don't seem to understand.
It's over.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.280
Just what will you accomplish?

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.600
I'm going to make it right.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.960
You want to set off
the goddamn alarm?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.720
Here. You'll need this.
We'll get our asses shot off!

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.680
- He wants more money.
- I don't like you. Tell him.

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.560
Oh, come on. Open it.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.000
I know you didn't want
to be a part of this.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.920
I know that you're a man of honour,

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.640
but Lawrence had something
on you from Vietnam,

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.720
something about the black
market, I don't know what.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.600
You made a mistake a long time ago.

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.360
You didn't want your name ruined,
so you looked away.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.200
I can sympathise with that.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:57.520
But there's no reason
to ruin everything now -

01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:00.200
your name along with it.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.320
You'll only do yourself harm
and everybody else.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.960
I don't give a shit.
I'm going to do what's right.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.640
Somebody's inside.
Let's get out of here.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.560
Wrong!

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.400
We're back in the shit again,
Colonel.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.800
Maclure - Christ, why?

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.280
It doesn't matter.

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:44.480
They screwed up.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.760
I'm going to make things right.

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:52.160
Don't.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.520
Don't!

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.000
I want you to do something for me.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.520
What?

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:26.760
Delay your report for 48 hours.

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.360
That'll give me time
to bury him with his name.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.960
He deserves that.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:39.480
- Please?
- OK.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.320
Thanks.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:49.920
None of us who knew
Sergeant Major Ross Maclure

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:53.960
could ever accuse him
of being perfect.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.560
However, only God can judge him now,
and I won't...

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.880
and I won't apologise for him.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.320
He was my friend.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.160
He was a soldier.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.040
We used to joke
that being in the army

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.880
is not a matter of life and death.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.920
It's more important than that.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:22.520
We first met in Vietnam.

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:25.400
He was my sergeant.
I was his lieutenant.

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:28.800
To this day, I don't know
who served under who.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.920
And it was his luck to be a hero
in a war nobody liked.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:37.920
He said to me the other day
that winning his medal

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.160
was a lot easier than wearing it.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.160
This is the second time

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.840
I've lost someone
who meant everything.

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.600
Whenever I've come
to visit this place,

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.840
I only hear the silence,
the sense of loss.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.000
Maclure heard something else.
For him, I hope it was right.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.880
There were so many things
that I wished...

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.800
I could have said to him...

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.840
and to others.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.560
And now that he's gone,
I realise that...

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.960
nothing should be left unsaid...

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.560
even between people
who don't say things easily.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.880
So, here we are...

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.920
in this place that he loved so much.

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:49.160
Here to say goodbye.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.880
If I know Maclure...

01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:58.600
he would be impatient
to be on his way.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.520
Ready...

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.480
Aim.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.800
Fire.

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.160
Fire.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.200
Fire.

01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:22.960
Take colours.

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.160
I'd like you to have this.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:32.280
Do you want to go for a walk?

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.760
Yeah. I'd like that very much.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:40.720
Come on.
