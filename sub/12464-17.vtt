WEBVTT

00:05.105 --> 00:08.107
OKAY.
TAKE A SIP.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.509
YOU WILL NEVER GUESS
WHAT'S IN THIS ONE.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.781
SKIM MILK,

00:15.783 --> 00:17.716
AVOCADO,

00:17.718 --> 00:19.118
PEANUT BUTTER,

00:19.120 --> 00:21.520
A HINT OF ZIT PUSS,

00:23.790 --> 00:25.257
CELERY JUICE

00:25.259 --> 00:29.028
AND HALF A CHEWED-UP
CHICKEN NUGGET.

00:30.296 --> 00:33.232
I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE,
AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.833
AMAZING.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.902
BOYS BOYS BOYS
BOYS BOYS BOYS.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.103
( squeals )

00:38.105 --> 00:40.305
SET YOUR PHASERS
TO EXCITEMENT.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.041
OKAY.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.109
THE PRODUCERS OF
"SPACE WEREWOLVES" JUST CALLED.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.778
THERE ARE APPARENTLY
ONLY THREE ACTORS

00:45.780 --> 00:47.780
STILL IN THE RUNNING
FOR THE LEAD,

00:47.782 --> 00:49.114
AND I'M ONE OF THEM!

00:49.116 --> 00:50.249
Both: WHOO!

00:50.251 --> 00:52.651
( all shout )

00:52.653 --> 00:54.053
"SPACE WEREWOLVES"

00:54.055 --> 00:58.123
IS THE GREATEST SCI-FI
GRAPHIC NOVEL EVER.

00:58.125 --> 01:01.260
IT IS THE EPIC TALE
OF TRISTAN LYCANTH,

01:01.262 --> 01:03.128
HALF-WOLF, HALF-HUMAN,

01:03.130 --> 01:05.798
AND HIS BATTLE
TO SAVE HIS PLANET.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.234
IT IS LIKE "STAR WARS"
AND "LORD OF THE RINGS"
HAD A BABY,

01:09.236 --> 01:13.105
AND THEN "THE AVENGERS"
ADOPTED IT.

01:13.107 --> 01:16.775
TRISTAN IS THE BADDEST
DUDE IN THE GALAXY.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.243
BUT IF LIV GETS THE PART,

01:18.245 --> 01:19.912
THEY'RE GONNA CHANGE HIM
TO A HER.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.114
AND THEN THE BADDEST
DUDE IN THE GALAXY

01:22.116 --> 01:23.248
WILL BE...

01:23.250 --> 01:24.850
MY SISTER.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.252
GUYS, MY FINAL AUDITION
IS IN A WEEK.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.721
THIS IS THE PART THAT COULD
MAKE ME A MOVIE STAR.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.790
UNBELIEVABLE.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.793
MY SISTER IS GONNA
BE TRISTAN LYCANTH.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.596
WHO ARE THE TWO LOSERS
YOU'RE UP AGAINST?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.797
RYAN GOSLING
AND VIN DIESEL.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.865
Both: OHH!

01:39.867 --> 01:43.235

02:35.389 --> 02:36.421
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU KEEP SAYING

02:36.423 --> 02:39.925
NOW THAT WE'RE
OFFICIALLY IN LIKE?

02:39.927 --> 02:41.927
WELL, IT'S MOSTLY
BEEN YOU THAT'S
BEEN SAYING THAT,

02:41.929 --> 02:44.296
BUT YOU'RE REALLY CUTE
WHEN YOU TALK, SO CONTINUE.

02:44.298 --> 02:47.933
WELL, I SIGNED US UP
FOR DANCE LESSONS.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.268
OOH.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.402
THAT COULD BE
ROMANTIC.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.305
WHAT KIND?
SALSA, TANGO, WALTZ?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.340
BREAKDANCING!

02:55.342 --> 02:57.276
( laughs )

02:57.278 --> 02:59.111
( snorts )
BREAKDANCING?

02:59.113 --> 03:00.345
- YEAH.
- ( chuckles )

03:00.347 --> 03:03.182
UM, DIGGIE,
THAT'S NOT COUPLE-Y.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.750
OH, MADS,
YOU'RE SO WRONG.

03:04.752 --> 03:08.120
MY WAVE COULD CONNECT
RIGHT TO YOUR WAVE.

03:09.289 --> 03:10.355
WHAT!

03:11.925 --> 03:13.458
AH, CHAIN WAVE.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.328
GIVE ME SOME OF THAT.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.197
( whooshing )

03:22.101 --> 03:25.137
SORRY, GUYS.
BREAKING'S JUST
NOT REALLY MY THING.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.940
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
WE'RE EVEN RELATED.

03:29.809 --> 03:31.276
UM, WELL--

03:31.278 --> 03:32.744
HEY, HERE'S AN IDEA.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.814
YOU GUYS BOTH SEEM
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS,

03:35.816 --> 03:38.350
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
THE LESSONS TOGETHER?

03:38.352 --> 03:40.285
AND THEN DIGGIE,
YOU AND I CAN FIGURE OUT

03:40.287 --> 03:42.454
SOMETHING THAT
WE BOTH WANT TO DO.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.456
- YOU HEARD THE LADY.
- OH!

03:46.159 --> 03:48.827
WE ARE BREAKING BROS NOW.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.962
CHAIN WAVE.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.965
( both whooshing )

03:57.904 --> 03:59.805
YEAH YEAH,
THAT WAS NICE.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.206
NOW LET ME
SHOW YOU MY WAVE.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.441
BUH-BYE.

04:06.779 --> 04:08.780
READY?

04:13.152 --> 04:14.820
RYE BREAD,

04:14.822 --> 04:16.955
MARMALADE,

04:16.957 --> 04:19.758
PUREED CAULIFLOWER,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.295
THE GOOD BOLOGNA

04:23.297 --> 04:27.466
AND JUST A HINT
OF TOENAIL.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.969
LEFT FOOT,
BIG TOE.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.838
( laughs )

04:32.840 --> 04:34.306
NAILED IT.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.277
OKAY.  SO BOYS, YOU GOT ME
A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS

04:38.279 --> 04:40.145
ABOUT MY "SPACE WEREWOLVES"
AUDITION,

04:40.147 --> 04:43.148
SO I DECIDED TO
GET MY WOLF ON WITH THIS:

04:43.150 --> 04:46.351
"THE WAY OF THE WOLF"
BY EMMY "FANGS" WOLFERT.

04:47.820 --> 04:49.354
"FANGS" IS A TEENAGE WOLF GIRL.

04:49.356 --> 04:51.223
WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE,
SHE WANDERED OFF ON
A CAMPING TRIP

04:51.225 --> 04:53.425
AND SPENT THE NEXT
10 YEARS OF HER LIFE

04:53.427 --> 04:55.294
IN THE WILD BEING
RAISED BY WOLVES.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.296
( chuckles )

04:57.298 --> 04:59.298
I WONDER IF THAT'S HOW
MADDIE BECAME MADDIE.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.033
( laughs )

05:01.035 --> 05:02.901
SHE LIKES WOLVES.
BIG WHOOP.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.836
I HEARD DIESEL
WANTS THE PART SO BAD,

05:04.838 --> 05:07.806
HE HAD WOLF FANGS
SURGICALLY IMPLANTED.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.341
WHAT?

05:09.343 --> 05:10.976
AND FOR THE PAST
TWO MONTHS,

05:10.978 --> 05:14.846
GOSLING'S BEEN EATING
NOTHING BUT ROADKILL.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.947
( stammers )

05:15.949 --> 05:17.316
THEY'RE GONNA CRUSH ME.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.984
OKAY,
I NEED YOUR HELP.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.153
HOW DO I FIGURE OUT TRISTAN?
WHAT'S HIS THING?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.355
NO BRAINER.
IT'S HIS HOWL.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.157
OKAY, YEAH.
I GOT THIS.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.291
( clears throat )

05:26.293 --> 05:29.094
( howls, scats )

05:33.966 --> 05:36.935
IT'S LIKE 50% WOLF,
50% LIV.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.404
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

05:39.406 --> 05:41.540
- DIESEL.
- GOSLING.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.911
<i>( dance music playing )</i>

05:49.849 --> 05:51.249
WHOA.

06:00.159 --> 06:02.361
-  <i>( dance music stops )</i>
<i>- THAT WAS AWESOME, Q-POP.</i>

06:02.363 --> 06:05.364
YEAH, Q-POP DON'T STOP.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.065
OH.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.333
( beats )

06:18.411 --> 06:21.380
MC J-TOWN IN DA HOUSE.

06:24.250 --> 06:27.185
MC J-TOWN
BE HIS OWN BOY.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.253
RESPECT!

06:31.657 --> 06:32.991
JOEY, THIS IS Q-POP.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.428
OH, WELL, IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU, MR. POP.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.296
MY MISSION IS
TO GET FRESH,

06:38.298 --> 06:40.899
STAY FRESH,
THEN REFRESH.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.103
I JUST DROPPED
MY MOTTO

06:45.105 --> 06:46.304
ON THIS GROTTO.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.906
( grunts )

06:47.908 --> 06:49.508
THIS IS SO COOL.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.176
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MADDIE BAILED.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.511
I FEEL SO ALIVE.

06:53.646 --> 06:57.115
HER LOSS IS
THE BREAKING BROS' GAIN.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.683
PLUS, WHO KNEW
I LIVED IN A GROTTO.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.252
RIGHT?

07:00.254 --> 07:02.454
ALL RIGHT.  LET'S SEE WHAT
Y'ALL ARE WORKING WITH.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.755
TIME TO GET FRESH, Y'ALL.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.692
WHEN I DROP THE BEAT,
I WANT TO SEE YOU ROBOT.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.563
<i>( dance music playing )</i>

07:13.399 --> 07:16.501
OH... NO.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.642
GENTLEMEN, ARE Y'ALL TRYING
TO MAKE Q-POP CRY?

07:25.645 --> 07:27.312
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TRY TO BACK IT UP

07:27.314 --> 07:29.648
TO A SIMPLER MOVE,
OKAY?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.384
THIS ONE IS CALLED
"FINDING THE BEAT!"

07:35.655 --> 07:37.722
( snaps fingers )

07:43.062 --> 07:45.464
OKAY, WAIT.
SLOW DOWN.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.200
HOW ARE YOU MAKING THAT
NOISE WITH YOUR FINGERS?

07:52.038 --> 07:54.539
OKAY,
HERE WE GO.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.711
OKAY, THIS IS JUST
FROZEN MUSTARD.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.482
BUT FROM WHERE?

08:06.652 --> 08:08.320
A LIGHT YELLOW DIJON

08:08.322 --> 08:10.322
ORIGINALLY
CRAFTED IN FRANCE

08:10.324 --> 08:14.659
BUT NOW MANUFACTURED
IN KENTUCKY...

08:14.661 --> 08:15.694
DIPPED ONCE--

08:15.696 --> 08:17.329
NO.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.199
TWICE!

08:21.201 --> 08:23.368
IN HOT DOG WATER.

08:25.304 --> 08:26.304
AH.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.373
INSPIRING.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.674
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:32.277
FANGS IS HERE!
FANGS IS HERE.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.478
OOH, THE GIRL
FROM THE BOOK?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.347
YEAH.
YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.481
I'VE REALIZED THAT
IF I WANT THIS PART

08:36.483 --> 08:38.350
I HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING REALLY BIG,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.685
SO I HIRED FANGS
TO HELP ME TAP INTO

08:40.687 --> 08:42.721
MY INNER WOLF.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.323
DELIVERY FOR LIV ROONEY?

08:45.325 --> 08:47.425
- SIGN HERE.
- OKAY.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.327
OH.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.464
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
MAYBE FANGS HAD ALL
HER BAGS SHIPPED HERE?

08:52.466 --> 08:54.332
( chuckles )

08:56.335 --> 08:57.402
( growls )

08:59.672 --> 09:01.740
IS THAT FANGS?

09:01.742 --> 09:05.377
NO, MUNCH, IT'S A DIFFERENT
GIRL WHO WAS RAISED BY WOLVES.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.813
HELLO, FANGS!

09:08.815 --> 09:10.382
ME LIV!

09:12.218 --> 09:13.418
( sniffs )

09:13.420 --> 09:15.220
I READ THIS
IN HER BOOK.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.188
SHE HAS TO GET USED TO
THE SMELL OF NEW PEOPLE.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.293
YOUR SCENT IS ACCEPTABLE.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.664
( sighs )

09:25.666 --> 09:27.699
SORRY ABOUT THE CAGE.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.668
MY WOLF INSTINCTS ARE STRONG,

09:29.670 --> 09:32.404
AND I DON'T TRUST MYSELF
AROUND NEW HUMANS.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.541
PLUS, IT'S CHEAPER TO
TRAVEL IN CARGO.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.745
WELL, FANGS,
THESE ARE MY BROTHERS.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.747
( yelps )

09:42.749 --> 09:44.349
( sniffs )

09:48.220 --> 09:49.287
( squeals )

09:51.157 --> 09:52.757
NOT GONNA LIE,
I'M INTO THIS.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.363
GLAD YOU CALLED,
ROONEY.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.365
I NEVER MISS A CHANCE
TO MAKE SURE WOLVES

10:00.367 --> 10:03.401
ARE ACCURATELY
PORTRAYED IN THE MEDIA.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.337
WELL, THEN,
IF ANYONE ASKS,

10:05.339 --> 10:07.205
I WILL PROUDLY
STATE FOR THE RECORD

10:07.207 --> 10:08.340
THAT YOU DID NOT
EAT MY GRANDMA

10:08.342 --> 10:10.342
OR BLOW MY HOUSE DOWN.
( chuckles )

10:10.344 --> 10:11.676
SEE, THAT RIGHT THERE?

10:11.678 --> 10:12.777
OFFENSIVE.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.348
LET'S BEGIN.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.516
TRISTAN LYCANTH
IS HALF-WOLF.

10:18.518 --> 10:23.288
WOLVES ARE MAJESTIC,
FIERCE CREATURES.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.489
YOU GOT ANY WOLF
IN YOU, ROONEY?

10:24.491 --> 10:27.659
UM, NO.
NO, SHE DOES NOT.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.161
LIVE SHE
SNIFFED MY PITS.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.197
I CAN'T LIE TO HER.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.698
HOWL FOR ME.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.234
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART ABOUT BEING A WOLF.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.336
IT ASSERTS
YOUR DOMINANCE.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.572
WELL, MY HOWL IS

10:40.574 --> 10:42.407
DOM-ALICIOUS.

10:44.543 --> 10:45.677
( growls )

10:45.679 --> 10:48.747
( howls, vocalizes )

10:54.620 --> 10:56.521
ROONEY, WE HAVE
WORK TO DO.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.189
WHAT?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.357
YOU'RE GONNA
LIVE LIKE A WOLF,

10:59.359 --> 11:01.493
HUNT LIKE A WOLF,
EAT LIKE A WOLF

11:01.495 --> 11:03.428
AND POOP LIKE A WOLF.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.463
OH, I CAN SHOW HER
THE LAST ONE.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.235
YEAH, I CAN IMITATE
THE POOPING STYLES

11:10.237 --> 11:13.705
OF 84 DIFFERENT
ANIMAL SPECIES.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.409
YOUR OFFER OF A POOP DEMO
IS APPRECIATED, LITTLE MAN.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.511
BUT LIV'S MY STUDENT NOW.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.880
WELCOME TO MY WOLF PACK.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.182
( gasps )

11:24.184 --> 11:27.185
THIS IS GONNA BE
SO AWESOME.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.424
AND IF YOU
NEED THE RESTROOM,

11:32.426 --> 11:33.658
IT'S JUST BACK
THAT WAY.

11:33.660 --> 11:34.959
NAH.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.494
MARKED MY TERRITORY
ON YOUR PORCH

11:36.496 --> 11:37.696
BEFORE I CAME IN.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.365
OOH, GOT AN ITCH.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.900
CAN'T GET IT.
CAN'T GET IT.

11:41.902 --> 11:42.901
- CAN'T GET IT.
- OKAY.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.602
HELP A WOLF OUT!

11:44.604 --> 11:46.237
OH!

11:46.239 --> 11:48.406
- ( murmurs )
- ( chuckles )

11:48.408 --> 11:49.908
AHH, THAT'S THE STUFF.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.376
YEAH?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.245
WOLF GIRL IS CRAY CRAY.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.581
BUT SHE IS GOING
TO GIVE ME THE FOREST CRED

11:56.583 --> 11:58.516
THAT I NEED TO REALLY
NAIL THIS AUDITION.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.385
( chuckles )
SCRAPE THAT OFF THE ROAD

12:00.387 --> 12:01.653
AND EAT IT, GOSLING.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.324
THIS IS FROM THE FOREST
WHERE MY WOLF FAMILY RAISED ME.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.960
LOTS OF GOOD STINK
TO ROLL AROUND IN.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.228
OH!

12:12.364 --> 12:13.898
AH.

12:13.900 --> 12:15.767
( gasps )

12:19.705 --> 12:21.406
AHH.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.843
YOUR TURN, WOLF PUP.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.478
GET UP IN IT.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.779
( clears throat )
OKAY.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.414
( chuckles )

12:30.716 --> 12:32.717
WHOO.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.253
LOOK AT ME.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.389
SCOOTING AROUND
IN THE FILTH.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.924
WHOO.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.259
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.460
I AM WILD!

12:44.430 --> 12:46.397
- ROONEY...
- YEAH?

12:46.399 --> 12:48.366
- CAN I GET REAL
FOR A MINUTE?
- MM-HMM?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.034
IF YOU WANT TO ACE
THIS AUDITION,

12:50.036 --> 12:51.836
YOU HAVE TO GO
FULL WOLF.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.705
WOLVES ARE
TERRITORIAL ANIMALS.

12:53.707 --> 12:54.839
- YEAH.
- THEY TAKE WHAT'S THEIRS,

12:54.841 --> 12:56.908
- AND THEY DON'T BACK DOWN.
- YEAH.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.443
LET'S TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.844
WHAT?

13:01.781 --> 13:02.914
YOU WANT IT?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.082
TAKE IT.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.584
- OKAY.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.720

13:08.722 --> 13:10.388
( growls )

13:10.390 --> 13:11.456

13:12.391 --> 13:14.325

13:26.705 --> 13:28.406
I'M GONNA GO

13:28.408 --> 13:30.408
( both growl )

13:32.378 --> 13:35.079
- SICK BEAT.
- SUPER TIGHT.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.317
SO...

13:39.319 --> 13:40.852
THE TWO OF YOU HAVE
GONE FROM BREAKDANCING

13:40.854 --> 13:42.720
TO SHARING EAR BUDS.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.622
( snorts )
THAT IS SO CUTE.

13:47.393 --> 13:51.029
Q-POP SAYS YOU GOTTA
DARE TO SHARE.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.397
YEAH.
SPEAKING OF SHARING,

13:52.399 --> 13:53.932
I HAVEN'T REALLY
SEEN YOU MUCH LATELY.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.834
DO YOU WANT TO GO
GRAB SOME FRO-YO
AFTER SCHOOL?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.402
OH, I'D LOVE TO,

13:57.404 --> 13:59.404
BUT WE HAVE A BREAKING
LESSON TONIGHT.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.640
CHECK OUT THESE
FUNKY FRESH MOVES.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.410
- READY, JOSEPH?
- SO READY, DIGS.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.945
( exhales )
FIVE, SIX,

14:06.947 --> 14:08.079
Both: SEVEN, EIGHT.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.747
WHAT?  YEAH!

14:09.749 --> 14:11.416

OH, OH!

14:11.418 --> 14:12.817
Both:
<i>AND DOWN TO THE GROUND.</i>

14:14.386 --> 14:15.386
UH!

14:15.388 --> 14:16.554
BEAM ME UP!

14:16.556 --> 14:17.856
( imitates whirring )

14:19.725 --> 14:20.859
( grunts )

14:20.861 --> 14:22.460
- WHAT UP?
- FIST BUMP.

14:23.395 --> 14:25.129
Both: GOOD SESH.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.839
( both growl, sniff )

14:39.678 --> 14:42.413
GREAT TRAINING SESH
THIS MORNING, FANGS.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.482
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN
CHASING DUCKS.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.417
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.820
THEY'VE HAD IT
TOO GOOD FOR TOO LONG.

14:50.522 --> 14:51.823
I THINK WE'VE
EARNED LUNCH.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.696
( both growl )

15:03.869 --> 15:05.169
( gasps )
EATING OFF THE FLOOR.

15:05.171 --> 15:08.039
WERE YOU
RAISED BY WOLVES?

15:08.041 --> 15:09.707
MOM.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.042
OH, SORRY SORRY.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.111
SORRY SORRY SORRY.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.417
THANKS FOR TRAINING
WITH ME SO HARD
THIS WEEK, FANGS.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.753
I AM GOING TO
NAIL THIS AUDITION.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.022
THAT PART IS SO MINE,
AM I RIGHT?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.890
( growls )

15:29.094 --> 15:30.094
WHEN THE WOLF
IS SILENT,

15:30.096 --> 15:31.629
THE WOLF DISAPPROVES.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.664
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:32.666 --> 15:35.199
AS GOOD AS YOU'RE DOING,

15:35.201 --> 15:37.635
THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
GONNA NAIL THAT AUDITION

15:37.637 --> 15:39.604
IS IF YOU
NAIL YOUR HOWL.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.706
IT IS THE HEART
AND SOUL OF ANY WOLF.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.044
( howls )

15:46.046 --> 15:48.479
-  <i>( dogs barking )</i>
<i>- WOW, I...</i>

15:48.481 --> 15:51.816
THINK YOU SCARED EVERY
DOG IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.084
NO.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.218
THERE'S A DOBERMAN
ON THE NEXT BLOCK

15:54.220 --> 15:55.987
WHO DIDN'T REPLY.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.556
( howls )

15:58.558 --> 16:00.024
<i>( dog barks )</i>

16:00.026 --> 16:02.593
THERE HE IS.

16:02.595 --> 16:03.795
HE APOLOGIZED.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.664
YOU CAN'T PEE AND BARK
AT THE SAME TIME.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.100
OKAY, ROONEY.
YOUR TURN.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.501
OKAY.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.103
( growls )

16:12.105 --> 16:14.238
( howls )

16:14.240 --> 16:17.175
( vocalizes "Amazing Grace" )

16:21.246 --> 16:23.214
QUIT GOOFING AROUND.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.783
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
YOUR HOWL SERIOUSLY.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.552
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:27.554 --> 16:28.619
I'M OUT.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.088
WHAT?

16:30.090 --> 16:32.757
YOU CAN'T BE OUT.
WE'RE IN A PACK.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.625
YOU LICKED MY FACE.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.228
I'M SORRY, ROONEY.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.763
WE'VE GONE AS FAR
AS WE CAN GO.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.499
PLUS, I'M ITCHY
AND YOUR MOM WON'T LET ME

16:41.501 --> 16:42.967
DRAG MY BUTT
ON YOUR CARPET.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.237
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FINE.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.774
I AM GOING TO BE
AN AWESOME TRISTAN
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.242
OH, YOU WANT THIS?

16:51.244 --> 16:52.777
MMM.  YEAH?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.112
YEAH,
I KNOW YOU WANT IT.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.847
YUM YUM, RIGHT?

16:55.849 --> 16:57.081
GO GET IT!

16:57.083 --> 16:58.282
( panting )

17:04.289 --> 17:06.824
( sighs )
STUPID WOLF.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.827
( whimpers )

17:16.235 --> 17:19.103
YES, YES, NO,

17:19.105 --> 17:23.307
BOOK IT, HATE IT,
ORANGE-- WHO IS THIS?!

17:23.309 --> 17:26.577
- LIV ROONEY, SUPERSTAR.
- HI.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.312
BEEN DYING TO MEET
THE GIRL WHO'S GOT
THE NERVE

17:28.314 --> 17:31.215
TO GO UP AGAINST
RYAN GOSLING AND
VIN DIESEL.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.084
WE ARE DYING TO SEE
WHAT YOU HAVE FOR US TODAY.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.685
<i>( bell rings )</i>

17:34.687 --> 17:36.054
NOW REMEMBER,
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

17:36.056 --> 17:38.056
IS THAT BIG HOWL AT
THE END OF YOUR SPEECH.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.290
REALLY LET LOOSE.

17:39.292 --> 17:40.758
TAKE ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED TO GET READY.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.126
I DON'T WANT
TO RUSH YOU.

17:42.128 --> 17:43.227
AND ACTION!

17:44.764 --> 17:48.900
THIS WAS MY CHANCE
TO BECOME A MOVIE STAR.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.570
BY THE STING
OF MY PROTON WHIP,

17:52.572 --> 17:55.173
I WILL BRING YOU
TO YOUR KNEES,

17:55.175 --> 17:57.308
FOR I AM YOUR DOOM.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.310
<i>I AM WOLF.</i>

17:59.312 --> 18:02.680
I AM TRISTAN LYCANTH.

18:04.316 --> 18:05.316
AND?!

18:07.252 --> 18:09.587
OH, RIGHT.  AND SCENE.
( giggles )

18:09.589 --> 18:11.789
NO, WHERE WAS MY HOWL?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.591
I NEED TO
HEAR A HOWL.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.726
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN
FROM THE TOP.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.296
OKAY.
( clears throat )

18:18.298 --> 18:20.364
UM, JUST TO BE CLEAR, THOUGH,

18:20.366 --> 18:22.233
THIS IS GONNA BE
WITHOUT THE HOWL?

18:22.235 --> 18:24.235
WITH THE HOWL.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.937
RIGHT.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.941
WHEN YOU TWO MARSHMALLOWS
FIRST STEPPED UP TO THE MAT,

18:29.943 --> 18:32.610
I WAS LIKE "BREAKDANCING
IS GONNA ROAST THEM ALIVE."

18:32.612 --> 18:34.278
( both scoff )

18:34.280 --> 18:36.781
BUT I'VE BEEN SPITTING
A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE TO YOU TWO,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.649
AND YOU ALL HAVE
SOAKED IT UP.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.792
MIX MASTER MADDIE
IN THE HOUSE!

18:47.794 --> 18:49.727
Joey:  <i>YEAH.</i>

18:49.729 --> 18:51.229
MADDIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.331
DIGGIE,
I REALIZED THAT...

18:53.333 --> 18:56.934
MEANS SOMETIMES DOING THINGS
THAT THE OTHER PERSON LIKES.

18:56.936 --> 18:59.270
SO I MET UP WITH
Q-POP EARLIER,

18:59.272 --> 19:00.838
AND HE TAUGHT ME
A COUPLE MOVES.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.841
I FIGURE IF I CAN'T BEAT 'EM,

19:03.843 --> 19:05.109
BREAK 'EM.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.777
OH, AND IF YOU CAN'T
BREAK 'EM,

19:06.779 --> 19:08.179
BREAKDANCE.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.247
( mouthing )

19:10.282 --> 19:11.249
SERIOUSLY, MADDIE,

19:11.251 --> 19:13.918
BREAKDANCING
IS MC J-TOWN

19:13.920 --> 19:15.186
AND DIG-DOG'S THING--

19:15.188 --> 19:17.355
WHOA!

19:17.357 --> 19:18.256
( clears throat )

19:18.258 --> 19:19.323
CUE IT, POP.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.225
OH, THAT'S HOW I DO!

19:21.227 --> 19:22.760
<i>( dance music playing )</i>

19:45.117 --> 19:47.185
AND THAT IS HOW I DO.

19:49.788 --> 19:51.189
YEAH, OKAY.
BEAT IT, JOEY.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.325
( beatboxing )

19:57.296 --> 19:59.330
THE OTHER "BEAT IT."

19:59.332 --> 20:00.331
I KNOW.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.335
( mouthing )

20:05.270 --> 20:06.270
OKAY.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.140
GET READY FOR A HOWL

20:09.142 --> 20:11.442
THAT IS GOING TO
CHANGE YOUR LIFE.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.211
<i>( chuckles )</i>
<i>OKAY, GET READY.</i>

20:13.213 --> 20:16.814
IT'S COMING.
( clears throat )

20:19.818 --> 20:22.820
JUST SORT OF LIKE
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD,

20:22.822 --> 20:24.255
WHAT IF IT WAS
SORT OF LESS OF A HOWL

20:24.257 --> 20:26.257
AND MORE OF A WHISTLE?

20:26.259 --> 20:28.259
YEAH, YEAH.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.161
'CAUSE I MEAN,
THE AUDIENCE TOTALLY--

20:30.163 --> 20:31.429
JUST HOWL!

20:33.131 --> 20:34.232

20:35.801 --> 20:38.402

20:40.339 --> 20:42.406
MY NAME IS FANGS WOLFERT,

20:42.408 --> 20:44.041
AND I'M HERE TO TRY OUT
FOR THE PART OF TRISTAN.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.044

20:47.046 --> 20:49.247
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.148
( chuckles )

20:51.150 --> 20:53.484
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND
TO TALK TO MY WOLF COACH
REAL QUICK.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.752
GET OUT.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.289
A WOLF TAKES
WHAT IT WANTS.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.157
AND I'M TAKING
THIS PART.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.425
OH.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.427
WE ARE ON
A SOUNDSTAGE

21:03.429 --> 21:04.895
RIGHT NOW, FANGS.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.265
THIS IS  <i>MY </i> TERRITORY.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.333
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.368

21:10.370 --> 21:11.802
( growls )

21:11.804 --> 21:13.471
I AM TRISTAN LYCANTH.

21:13.473 --> 21:17.375
NO, I AM TRISTAN LYCANTH.

WOW.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.525
LET US DISCUSS
AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.827
FIND OUT WHO STYLES
THE BRUNETTE'S HAIR.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.928
I LOVE IT.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.432
FANGS!

21:41.434 --> 21:44.168
ALL PART OF MY PLAN.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.836
( chuckles )

21:45.838 --> 21:47.271
OH-HO...

21:47.273 --> 21:49.473
YOU ARE GOOD.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.010
I KNEW THAT IF
I THREATENED YOUR TERRITORY,

21:53.012 --> 21:54.478
ALL OUR HARD WORK
WOULD PAY OFF

21:54.480 --> 21:56.314
AND YOUR INNER WOLF
WOULD EMERGE.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.482
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D BEAT GOSLING
OR DIESEL,

21:58.484 --> 22:01.886
BUT I DID IT, FANGS.
I HOWLED.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.220
I HEARD.

22:03.222 --> 22:05.523
IT SOUNDED
LIKE MY MOTHER.

22:12.431 --> 22:14.498
( both howl )

22:18.303 --> 22:20.304
OH, THIS TENSION
IS KILLING ME.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.474
OUR LITTLE BABY
COULD BE A MOVIE STAR.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.376
NOT COULD BE.
WILL BE.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.178
GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.146
SHE JUST PULLED UP.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.350
OKAY, EVERYBODY
JUST ACT NORMAL.

22:35.620 --> 22:37.288
OKAY...

22:37.290 --> 22:38.622
MORE NORMAL THAN THAT.

22:43.161 --> 22:45.363
HEY, GUYS.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.365
OH, NO.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.866
OH WELL.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.434
WHO CAN BEAT
GOSLING AND DIESEL?

22:50.436 --> 22:52.002

22:52.004 --> 22:54.305

23:06.519 --> 23:08.452

23:08.454 --> 23:10.388
I REALLY REALLY REALLY
APPRECIATE THAT,

23:10.390 --> 23:13.157
BUT I'M PRETTY WIPED OUT
FROM THE AUDITION,

23:13.159 --> 23:15.226

23:15.228 --> 23:16.360
