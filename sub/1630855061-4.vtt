WEBVTT

00:04.265 --> 00:07.137
The key to a gigantic
afternoon cocktail

00:07.137 --> 00:09.226
is a well-balanced skewer.

00:09.226 --> 00:10.619
You can't go wrong.

00:10.619 --> 00:12.751
Yes, Klaus, ya can.

00:12.751 --> 00:15.145
I like my olive holes
clean as a whistle.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.324
Dang, you straight-up
inhaled that blue cheese!

00:20.324 --> 00:22.370
I don't think your esophagus
even opened!

00:22.370 --> 00:25.242
I prefer to let my lungs
digest the useless stuff.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.810
Klaus, my good man!

00:27.810 --> 00:29.246
Jeffrey, my good sir!

00:29.246 --> 00:32.075
To what do I owe
this great pleasure?

00:32.075 --> 00:36.036
I'm here to invite you
on a pleasant afternoon!

00:36.036 --> 00:38.560
A pleasant afternoon,
you say?

00:38.560 --> 00:40.431
That sounds delightful!

00:40.431 --> 00:43.782
Ugh. Every day with
the pleasant afternoons.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.871
You're like an old
retired couple.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.570
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:48.570 --> 00:53.009
<i>♪ Ooh, that's why I'm easy ♪</i>

00:56.491 --> 00:58.580
<i>♪ I'm easy like Sunday morning ♪</i>

00:59.842 --> 01:01.974
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

01:04.368 --> 01:11.071
<i>♪ That's why I'm easy ♪</i>

01:11.071 --> 01:18.208
<i>♪ I'm easy like Sunday morning ♪</i>

01:18.208 --> 01:21.559
Hey Klaus, what's your
greatest dream?

01:21.559 --> 01:25.215
Probably renting
a lake house together.

01:25.215 --> 01:28.131
Imagine
the pleasant afternoons

01:28.131 --> 01:29.785
we could have there together!

01:29.785 --> 01:31.482
What's your
greatest dream?

01:33.267 --> 01:35.617
I think
this might be it...

01:53.896 --> 01:55.811
Klaus, my good man!

01:55.811 --> 01:57.334
Jeffrey, my good sir!

01:57.334 --> 01:59.162
They're still doing
pleasant afternoons?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.729
Yep.

02:00.729 --> 02:03.732
Today is actually
quite pleasant, Stan!

02:03.732 --> 02:05.603
We're going to an estate sale!

02:05.603 --> 02:08.432
The sellers make up
the craziest stories

02:08.432 --> 02:10.739
to unload
some dead guy's junk.

02:10.739 --> 02:14.960
Every sword is Excalibur
and all the guns killed Kennedy.

02:17.093 --> 02:18.268
Headed to Sub Hub.

02:18.268 --> 02:19.965
Might be
my last shift ever, though.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.663
Everyone's freaking out
about a new sandwich shop

02:21.663 --> 02:23.055
opening tomorrow.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.493
The owners are some hot shots
from Albuquerque.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.930
Did you say... Albuquerque?

02:27.930 --> 02:30.498
- Yeah.
- The ABQ is home

02:30.498 --> 02:32.761
to the world's foremost
sandwich innovators!

02:32.761 --> 02:35.242
It's a proving ground
for sandwich artists, Hayley!

02:35.242 --> 02:37.113
Yeah, whatever.
I'm leaving now.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.943
I heard in Albuquerque

02:40.943 --> 02:43.293
they shave the meat so thin

02:43.293 --> 02:45.252
you can hold it up to the light
and look through it

02:45.252 --> 02:47.732
to see the exact moment
of your death.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.169
Yum.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.088
Hey, it's the Pleasant Boys!

02:56.088 --> 02:57.916
Looking good!

02:57.916 --> 03:00.223
Principal Lewis,
shouldn't you be in school?

03:00.223 --> 03:01.877
Shh, I'm playing hooky.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.661
I never miss an estate sale.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.751
They're treasure troves
for vintage pornography.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.579
- Oh?
- Oh.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.320
Very much "oh."

03:10.320 --> 03:12.366
Last month, I found
a poor-condition

03:12.366 --> 03:14.194
<i>Penthouse</i> number one!

03:14.194 --> 03:16.674
It tells the vagina's
origin story.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.808
Welcome, everyone!

03:19.808 --> 03:22.202
Here comes the crazy backstory.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.942
I bet she'll say
an astronaut lived here.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.380
No!
A disgraced sea captain!

03:26.380 --> 03:27.598
Bet you a slice of pie.

03:27.598 --> 03:30.210
You're on!

03:30.210 --> 03:33.213
The items in this house
are very special,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.389
because the owner
was very unique.

03:35.389 --> 03:38.130
The house was owned by...

03:38.130 --> 03:40.785
Come on,
disgraced sea captain...

03:40.785 --> 03:42.222
...a wizard!

03:42.222 --> 03:43.440
- Damn!
- Pie!

03:43.440 --> 03:45.094
Better get your checkbooks out,

03:45.094 --> 03:46.791
because you pathetic mortals

03:46.791 --> 03:49.577
can own a dead wizard's
air fryer!

03:49.577 --> 03:52.101
I'll pay
fifty dollars for it!

03:52.101 --> 03:54.277
Rolex Gordini,
and I'm my own boss.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.323
Reselling random stuff on eBay

03:56.323 --> 03:58.890
is one of my many side gigs
in the new economy.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.370
Okay.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.763
How much for this fancy comb?

04:01.763 --> 04:03.721
Ahh, yes.

04:03.721 --> 04:07.116
- The enchanted hair comb.
- Save it, lady.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.291
- Five bucks?
- Sold.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.685
Is this a first
generation Sonicare?

04:10.685 --> 04:12.426
I'll give you ten dollars
for it.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.384
Two hundred if it comes
with the gunky base.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.430
Three hundred if it comes
with a funky vase.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.824
That comb gives me the creeps.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.174
What's with all the weird
writing on the side?

04:22.174 --> 04:24.220
Whatever, man, it's gonna
look sick in my alcove.

04:24.220 --> 04:25.961
Let's boogie.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.271
Ooh.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.883
Get in line, those are
the hottest boys in town.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.581
Anyhoo, I'll be taking this
turn o' the century strap-on.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.540
That's a Civil War telescope.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.846
Right...

04:45.415 --> 04:47.417
Albuquerque has been
on warp speed

04:47.417 --> 04:50.028
with sandwich development
for years, Francine!

04:50.028 --> 04:52.727
Who would've thought we'd see
jalapeño ciabatta

04:52.727 --> 04:54.642
in our lifetime?

04:56.992 --> 04:59.081
Is this joker serious?

04:59.081 --> 05:01.475
Think ya could use
headphones, pal?

05:01.475 --> 05:03.651
Nah.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.479
This [bleep] guy, Stan!

05:05.479 --> 05:07.959
The nerve! And so ugly!

05:07.959 --> 05:09.657
Please,
let's not do anything rash--

05:09.657 --> 05:12.007
Especially his face is ugly!

05:17.621 --> 05:20.015
Okay, sure, that was
my black cherry Zevia--

05:27.544 --> 05:29.198
What was that?

05:31.418 --> 05:34.246
Little chilly.

05:35.509 --> 05:38.468
Jesus, Stan. It's cold
as a mummy's popsicle in here.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.165
Stan?

05:41.079 --> 05:42.080
Who's there?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.648
Who's down there?

05:44.648 --> 05:45.693
Jeff?

05:45.693 --> 05:47.347
Hayley?

05:47.347 --> 05:50.262
Jurgen?

06:02.057 --> 06:04.755
You saw a ghost?
Are you okay?

06:04.755 --> 06:06.235
This is gonna sound weird,

06:06.235 --> 06:08.019
but I'm actually
better than okay.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.457
I want you to meet my...

06:12.154 --> 06:13.460
- G-g-g-g--
- Yes!

06:13.460 --> 06:14.939
My new girlfriend!

06:14.939 --> 06:16.811
She's a wraith, bro!

06:21.859 --> 06:23.252
I get it, man.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.949
I passed out last night, too.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.211
From exhaustion.

06:26.211 --> 06:29.040
From all the lovemaking.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.870
Jeff, wake up,
you're being rude right now.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.135
As I was saying,

06:37.135 --> 06:38.789
making love to a wraith

06:38.789 --> 06:41.488
is like boning a fine mist.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.750
Is that good?

06:42.750 --> 06:45.796
Oh, yes.

06:45.796 --> 06:48.408
Oh, my God!
There's a ghost doing sudoku!

06:48.408 --> 06:50.061
She's my new girlfriend!

06:50.061 --> 06:51.454
How?

06:51.454 --> 06:53.238
Love is a mystery, Hayley.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.806
I was just explaining that
to these jabronis.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.895
- Pull up a seat.
- Definitely not.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.289
Hey, don't you have a pickleball
match against the Debs?

07:03.771 --> 07:06.077
Don't be jealous,
you can come.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.428
I'm actually a bit
of an athlete.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.691
Feel my bicep.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.823
I'm not even flexing.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.390
Waddup, Debs?

07:14.390 --> 07:16.087
Ready to get your shit
rocked again?

07:21.528 --> 07:23.965
Is the wraith gonna sit there
the whole time?

07:23.965 --> 07:25.445
Of course, she's my girlfriend.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.881
Head in the game.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.797
It's just-- I didn't
want to say anything before,

07:29.797 --> 07:33.496
but it kinda feels like
she's staring through my soul.

07:33.496 --> 07:34.845
You wish, bro.

07:34.845 --> 07:36.064
Head in the game!

07:36.064 --> 07:37.282
Okay!

07:39.546 --> 07:41.286
Fault! Heh!

07:41.286 --> 07:44.333
Looks like your ace server's
having an off day, Klaus!

07:44.333 --> 07:48.206
Classic Deb,
always with the razzing!

07:48.206 --> 07:50.165
this bitch up.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.176
Aah!

08:01.176 --> 08:03.744
I'm so sorry!
I'll bring water!

08:03.744 --> 08:05.746
And a beer!

08:09.837 --> 08:11.012
Oh, good, you're awake.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.404
I have terrible news.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.537
Stan, your jaw
is completely shattered.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.365
Need sandwiches.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.149
Sandwiches? Oh, hell no.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.848
Your life is headed
in another direction right now.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.851
You're entering the straw phase.

08:29.247 --> 08:31.162
Um, Klaus?
You missed the part

08:31.162 --> 08:32.860
where you bang
coconuts together.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.515
Let's talk about the creative
direction of this band.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.474
This song sounds too,
I dunno, happy?

08:38.474 --> 08:41.259
But good music isn't happy, right?

08:41.259 --> 08:45.568
I think our songs
should be darker, wraithier.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.570
Our songs should be wraithier?

08:47.570 --> 08:48.571
Exactly.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.747
And this is your idea?

08:50.747 --> 08:53.620
Yes. I've been wrestling with it
for weeks.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.752
Really?
You wanted our music

08:55.752 --> 08:58.842
to be wraithier
even before you two met?

08:58.842 --> 09:02.019
We should be experimenting
with new kinds of instruments.

09:02.019 --> 09:04.065
Like instead of coconuts,

09:04.065 --> 09:06.676
I could shake this coffee tin
filled with old teeth.

09:08.939 --> 09:10.593
Sounds great, right?

09:10.593 --> 09:13.030
- Klaus--
- Or I could rattle chains.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.294
Klaus?

09:18.949 --> 09:20.995
Sorry, sometimes
she hijacks my brain

09:20.995 --> 09:22.823
and shows me hilarious visions.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.912
- She's so funny.
- Ugh.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.478
Jeff, where are you going?

09:26.478 --> 09:28.263
Damn, he's gone.

09:28.263 --> 09:31.179
Show me the cat video again.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.883
How's your lasagna, Stan?

09:39.883 --> 09:41.581
Smooth enough for ya?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.670
Let me guess. Mom pissed off
another beefy dude

09:43.670 --> 09:45.585
and Dad got caught
in the crossfire.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.587
Sorry we're late.
We were making love.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.546
Well...?

09:50.546 --> 09:51.765
You're too kind.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.854
Now, I have an announcement!

09:53.854 --> 09:57.597
The wraith and I are going
to rent a lake house together!

09:57.597 --> 10:01.339
What? You're taking that thing
to our lake house?

10:01.339 --> 10:05.343
I'm sorry, did we talk about
renting a lake house together?

10:05.343 --> 10:08.085
Yeah! You said it was
your greatest dream!

10:08.085 --> 10:09.957
Really? Huh.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.960
I don't even remember
thinking that.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.005
May I be excused?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.093
Who are you asking?

10:16.093 --> 10:17.617
Permission!

10:20.315 --> 10:22.752
I need advice, Roger.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.406
You caught me at a bad time.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.843
I'm freelance graphic
designing a new Apple logo.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.587
It's on spec, so I won't get
paid until Tim Cook buys it.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.764
I can't stand
Klaus's girlfriend.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.419
She ruined
our pleasant afternoons!

10:37.419 --> 10:39.813
Sounds like a textbook
comb wraith.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.379
A what?

10:41.379 --> 10:42.685
I'll explain in the car.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.382
I'm also a Lyft driver.

10:44.382 --> 10:46.646
If I can design a couple
of logos on the way,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.561
bring Greg his Pad Thai,
and build a shed,

10:49.561 --> 10:52.129
I'll make
forty-five dollars today.

10:54.131 --> 10:57.221
This is the last surviving
Lyft mustache.

10:57.221 --> 10:59.528
They don't want people
to use these anymore.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.661
Go ahead, try it on.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.316
Ugh, I wish Klaus's wraith
would disappear forever.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.144
Are you being selfish, Jeff?

11:07.144 --> 11:09.712
- No.
- Okay, then I will help.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.279
Klaus's wraith is tethered

11:11.279 --> 11:13.716
to the comb
he bought at the estate sale.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.544
Wherever the comb goes,
the wraith goes.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.981
Steal the comb
and give it to someone else.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.722
It's the only way
to break them up.

11:19.722 --> 11:20.897
Oh, I got a hit

11:20.897 --> 11:22.725
on My Sweet Chef.

11:22.725 --> 11:25.119
It's this app where the angry
chef at a mediocre restaurant

11:25.119 --> 11:28.688
lets out his frustrations on me
instead of the waitresses.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.742
Bingo.

11:44.399 --> 11:47.184
Aah! I'm pooing,
I'm pooing myself!

11:51.798 --> 11:53.930
This is exceptional work, Jeffrey.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.715
Outstanding!

11:55.715 --> 11:57.629
Bravo!

11:58.674 --> 12:00.197
You're quiet today.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.503
Oh, it's nothing.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.723
Hey, did you see my wraith
this morning?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.855
When I woke up, she was gone.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.901
Gone, you say?

12:07.901 --> 12:10.381
And she took all her stuff,
even her comb.

12:10.381 --> 12:12.470
She did leave some shitty
underwear on the floor,

12:12.470 --> 12:14.951
so I guess that's a good sign.

12:23.917 --> 12:26.615
We get it, Tuttle.
You're in a good mood.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.835
Oh, I'm better than good.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
I don't want
to speak out of turn,

12:30.793 --> 12:34.014
but last night I got
la-la-la-la-la-laid

12:34.014 --> 12:35.493
by a wra-wra-
wra-wra-wra-wraith!

12:38.975 --> 12:41.238
That's how I looked last night,

12:41.238 --> 12:42.500
for like an hour.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.155
After the sex
that lasted thirty seconds.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.941
I was doing what I do every
night-- getting my reps in.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.945
Three hundred ninety-six...

12:51.945 --> 12:53.555
Three hundred ninety-seven...

12:58.821 --> 13:01.737
Oh, hello.

13:01.737 --> 13:03.652
And now we're in love!

13:08.178 --> 13:11.442
She left me... for Tuttle.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.449
Klaus, this isn't
the place to do this.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.538
Would you like me
to walk you to Chili's?

13:23.454 --> 13:27.241
Do you ever feel lonely
during the day?

13:27.241 --> 13:29.634
God, no.
I have the TV,

13:29.634 --> 13:31.854
a handful of imaginary friends.

13:31.854 --> 13:34.814
This right here
is the good life.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.598
My good man!

13:36.598 --> 13:39.035
Care for a pleasant afternoon?

13:39.035 --> 13:41.342
Sorry, but I'm too depressed

13:41.342 --> 13:43.561
about losing
the love of my life.

13:43.561 --> 13:46.086
Well, then
a pleasant afternoon

13:46.086 --> 13:48.479
may be just
what the doctor ordered.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.655
I'm just gonna stay here
and watch <i>CoComelon</i>

13:50.655 --> 13:52.788
until I understand it.

13:52.788 --> 13:55.530
This is effing horse crap!

13:55.530 --> 13:58.054
We're going to have
a pleasant afternoon

13:58.054 --> 13:59.795
whether you like it or not!

13:59.795 --> 14:01.710
You can't make me.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.365
I guess you can.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.150
Stan! Where are you?

14:07.150 --> 14:10.937
Your banana-ribeye smoothie
is starting to look nasty.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.547
Stan?

14:26.778 --> 14:29.564
Eating a sandwich in your
condition would be suicide.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.252
Let's go, son.
There's nothing to see here.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.209
This is the lake house
I rented for my ex-wraith!

15:49.209 --> 15:50.645
Why would you take me here?

15:50.645 --> 15:53.561
Because before it was
your guys's dream,

15:53.561 --> 15:56.085
it was our guys's dream.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.783
I already set up Scrabble,

15:58.783 --> 16:00.960
the most pleasant board game.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.842
Uh, let's play something else.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.365
Just stop, Jeff!

16:15.365 --> 16:19.369
Leave me alone so I can die
in heartbroken agony.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.633
Or a blood infection from
scooting along this cabin floor.

16:28.639 --> 16:32.426
Roger, I need you to steal
the comb back from Tuttle.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.862
I'm delivering grub tonight.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.038
Log onto the app, order a
Mediterranean platter,

16:36.038 --> 16:37.344
and write "comb" in the notes.

16:39.172 --> 16:41.478
My cheek must've grazed
the screen

16:41.478 --> 16:44.046
because I accepted
a housecleaning job in Chimdale.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.919
Oh, I hit a deer!

16:47.919 --> 16:50.009
Never mind, it's just a guy.

16:54.274 --> 16:56.363
Well, look who it is.

16:56.363 --> 16:59.757
Stan Smith,
star of the local newspaper!

16:59.757 --> 17:03.109
"Amazing Man Eats Sandwich"
was the headline, I believe.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.763
I don't think
I like your tone, Doctor.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.157
My husband is a hero.

17:08.157 --> 17:11.334
Your husband broke expensive
medical equipment.

17:11.334 --> 17:14.076
That's not considered
very "heroic" where I come from.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.078
That's odd, Doctor.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.081
I could've sworn you came
from up your own ass.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.301
Excuse me?

17:21.301 --> 17:24.130
Oh, I must be mistaken.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.523
That's where
yo mama came from!

17:27.916 --> 17:30.092
Oh, now you're
starting with me?

17:31.963 --> 17:33.835
You call those punches?

17:33.835 --> 17:35.489
If you're gonna
give him a massage,

17:35.489 --> 17:37.795
I'm gonna go to the cafeteria.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.194
Thanks, Roger.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.415
Whoa, what's up
with this cucumber salad?

17:48.415 --> 17:51.070
It's all sloshed around
with the hummus--

17:51.070 --> 17:53.463
These mountain roads
are extremely winding,

17:53.463 --> 17:55.944
but that twenty percent tip
is gonna go a long way

17:55.944 --> 17:58.686
towards the repairs
the car needs.

17:58.686 --> 17:59.861
Okay.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.129
Awwww, shucks.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.697
Still depressed.
Just taking a leak.

18:12.352 --> 18:14.528
I'm sorry, Klaus.

18:14.528 --> 18:15.833
The wraith's comb?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.313
Why do you have this?

18:17.313 --> 18:19.707
The wraith never
left you for Tuttle.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.492
She is forced to go
wherever the comb goes...

18:22.492 --> 18:25.495
so I stole it
while you were sleeping

18:25.495 --> 18:27.410
- and gave it to him.
- What?

18:27.410 --> 18:30.196
I thought she was ruining
pleasant afternoons,

18:30.196 --> 18:32.459
but I was the real problem.

18:32.459 --> 18:33.677
Are you kidding me?

18:33.677 --> 18:35.244
You sabotaged my relationship

18:35.244 --> 18:37.638
to save pleasant afternoons!?

18:37.638 --> 18:38.769
I did.

18:38.769 --> 18:42.077
That's...
the most beautiful thing

18:42.077 --> 18:44.514
that anyone has ever done
for me.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.561
- Huh?
- You fought for me, bro!

18:47.561 --> 18:49.780
No one's ever done that before.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.086
What about the wraith?

18:51.086 --> 18:53.132
I really thought I loved her,

18:53.132 --> 18:55.221
but I guess
she never had a choice.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.788
She had to go
where the comb told her.

18:57.788 --> 18:58.833
You know what?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.051
I'm gonna do the right thing

19:00.051 --> 19:02.576
and set this bad bitch free!

19:11.889 --> 19:16.155
That comb was my [bleep] home!

19:16.155 --> 19:18.592
Now I destroyed your home!

19:18.592 --> 19:20.637
How does that feel?

19:20.637 --> 19:23.118
- Technically, it's a VRBO.
- Klaus!

19:23.118 --> 19:26.904
How about I destroy
your bodies instead?

19:26.904 --> 19:28.384
How about you don't!

19:28.384 --> 19:31.561
Klaus just set you free.
He's a good guy.

19:31.561 --> 19:34.651
You'd be lucky
to have a guy like Klaus!

19:34.651 --> 19:39.090
He told everyone we had sex,
which is not true.

19:39.090 --> 19:42.616
- You didn't?
- Easy now, we did some stuff.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.183
No, we didn't.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.880
Do you want to... now?

19:51.015 --> 19:55.281
<i>♪ He goes by the name
of Old Ulysses ♪</i>

19:55.281 --> 19:57.718
<i>♪ Old Ulysses ♪</i>

19:57.718 --> 19:59.937
Stop! You're free now!

19:59.937 --> 20:01.635
Do you really want to kill us?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.289
I...

20:03.289 --> 20:06.814
I don't know what I want.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.208
No one has ever
asked me before.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.906
Well, what do you want?

20:11.906 --> 20:15.388
No, I'm too embarrassed to say.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.520
Christ, girl! Just say it!

20:17.520 --> 20:22.133
Well, I guess
I always wanted to, um...

20:22.133 --> 20:24.701
visit every Major League
baseball stadium

20:24.701 --> 20:27.487
over one unforgettable summer.

20:28.357 --> 20:32.100
That sounds... pleasant.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.672
<i>And that's how
a pleasant afternoon</i>

20:38.672 --> 20:41.762
<i>turned into the greatest
summer of our lives.</i>

20:46.288 --> 20:49.335
Wraithy, I'm home!

20:49.335 --> 20:50.336
Belinda?

20:51.380 --> 20:52.903
Ohh!

20:52.903 --> 20:55.297
She's gone!

20:56.298 --> 20:57.473
Bye-bye! See you soon!
