WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:03.737
Oh, shoot!

00:03.804 --> 00:04.905
What?

00:04.972 --> 00:07.141
Oh, the new armoire
is being delivered today,

00:07.208 --> 00:08.609
and someone
has to be home

00:08.676 --> 00:11.645
between noon and 3:00
to sign for it.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.481
No, Mom, I can't.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.949
I have class
and then work.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.319
Oh! You know what? Maybe
Jenny could cover my shift.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.091
No, what am I thinking?
She's still in Rhode Island.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.158
Sorry, Mom.

00:25.959 --> 00:26.960
I'll do it
for 10 bucks.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.729
( Scoffs )
Get to school!

00:28.796 --> 00:31.399
I love you guys.
Bye, guys.
Kendra: Love you.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.966
Good morning,
everybody. Hey.
Good morning!

00:33.033 --> 00:35.569
Oh! Chale, you're gonna
be home today, right?

00:35.636 --> 00:38.539
Well, as you know,
I am here every day.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.409
And I would do anything
to help out my future
mother-in-law.

00:41.475 --> 00:42.910
But not today.
( Chuckles )

00:42.976 --> 00:44.178
I'm heading into the city.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.979
There's
an investors conference

00:46.046 --> 00:47.948
that could lead to --
hope, hope --

00:48.015 --> 00:49.583
some startup funds,
which would mean

00:49.650 --> 00:51.452
I would be allowed
to start paying you rent

00:51.519 --> 00:52.520
for living in the garage.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.355
But, once again,
no guarantees.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.456
Oh.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.024
( Chuckles )

00:58.092 --> 00:59.493
Oh! Honey!
Hey, babe!

00:59.560 --> 01:01.895
Oh, I'm so glad
I caught you.
Yeah?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.097
Hey, listen,
I have a delivery coming,

01:03.164 --> 01:04.298
and I need you
to be home

01:04.365 --> 01:06.066
between noon and 3:00 today
to sign for it.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.136
Oh, you know I would love
to help you out there,

01:08.202 --> 01:10.371
but no can do, 'cause I, uh --
I got an appointment.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.206
An appointment?
Yeah.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.775
Uh, at 11:00,
I got a light lunch,

01:14.842 --> 01:16.877
and then, uh...

01:16.944 --> 01:19.513
little pigskin on the gridiron
at noon, so...

01:19.580 --> 01:20.681
Football? No!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.250
No, you're retired now,

01:22.316 --> 01:23.917
and you can help me
with these kind of things.
Oh, come on.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.687
You're asking me to sit around
all day and do nothing here?

01:26.754 --> 01:30.224
That's what you do
every other day.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.360
It's by choice, though, Donna.
It's a big difference.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.727
Come on.
I'm playing football.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.863
No! No.
I need you here, okay?

01:35.929 --> 01:38.266
Plus, you and your buddies
tackling each other in a field

01:38.332 --> 01:39.467
is a terrible idea.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.068
You always wind up injured
and laying around

01:41.135 --> 01:42.703
and complaining about it
for a week.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.738
Okay, that is
a crazy exaggeration.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.974
There might have been, like,
a couple bumps and bruises.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.109
You threw your back out,
Duffy lost a tooth,

01:49.177 --> 01:50.778
and didn't Mott
get a concussion?

01:50.844 --> 01:52.146
No, it wasn't
a concussion.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.947
It was after the game,
he drank a soda,

01:54.014 --> 01:56.550
and he just stood up too fast,
that's all.

01:57.985 --> 02:02.990
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:03.056 --> 02:05.326
You got to go home
and wait for a delivery?

02:05.393 --> 02:07.228
Man, we challenged these guys
months ago.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.796
We can't back out now.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.564
I heard those rookie cops
have been talking
a lot of smack

02:10.631 --> 02:11.865
about us being retired.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.602
Yeah. "Oh, we're young.
We can do a pull-up.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.605
Our prostates
are normal-sized."

02:17.671 --> 02:19.207
Come on, man,
we got to shut them up!

02:19.273 --> 02:20.574
I know.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.310
Believe me, I've been training
for this for six months.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.077
( Scoffs )

02:24.144 --> 02:26.747
Mentally, guy -- mentally.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.749
( As Howard Cosell )
2016.

02:28.816 --> 02:33.086
The setting --
Mansfield Park, Massapequa.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.656
These gladiators
right here --

02:35.723 --> 02:37.691
Uhh...
we're not playing.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.826
What?!

02:38.892 --> 02:39.960
Donna's making your brother
stay at home

02:40.027 --> 02:41.429
to wait for an armoire.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.397
Okay, she's not making me,
all right? She works hard.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.366
She asked me
to do her a favor, you know.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.201
I'm doing it 'cause
it's the right thing to do.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.702
Why don't you get
a Chore Weasel to do it?

02:51.239 --> 02:52.273
A Chore Weasel?

02:52.340 --> 02:53.574
Yeah,
I heard of that.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.175
It -- It's an app,
like Uber,

02:55.243 --> 02:57.445
except people come over
and do stuff for you.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.947
Yeah, we used one last week.
17 bucks an hour.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.583
He stood in line
for tickets to "Aladdin."

03:02.650 --> 03:04.485
Not for me -- for another guy
down at the firehouse.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.622
It was me.
Huh.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.792
Great show.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.026
I don't know, man.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.695
Paying a stranger
to sit at the house all day

03:14.762 --> 03:16.930
while I'm playing football?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.098
What do I tell Donna?

03:18.165 --> 03:20.000
You don't.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.735
Well, that solves that.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.807
Okay, so,
I'll sign for the delivery,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.041
lock up when I leave,

03:28.108 --> 03:29.677
and you'll get the invoice
sent to your phone.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.778
Uh, listen, about that --

03:30.844 --> 03:32.012
and it's not a big deal
or anything,

03:32.079 --> 03:33.614
but is there any way
the charge can come up

03:33.681 --> 03:36.950
as "Long Island CrossFit,"
you know?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.486
I'm not sure
I could swing that,

03:38.552 --> 03:40.288
but you will be billed
discreetly.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.189
You'll hear
our Chore Weasel tone...

03:42.256 --> 03:45.526
( Cellphone chimes
melodically )

03:45.593 --> 03:46.694
...and you're all set.
Great.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.028
I mean, not that I'm doing
anything wrong.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.497
It's just that I don't want
my wife to be part of --

03:49.563 --> 03:52.466
Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry, Mr. Gable.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.468
I've had my share
of married men.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.340
( Rock music plays )

04:11.151 --> 04:13.020
( Indistinct talking )

04:13.086 --> 04:14.154
Come on!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.332
( Indistinct talking )

04:28.869 --> 04:30.003
Ten-hut!

04:30.070 --> 04:31.505
( All grunting )

04:49.189 --> 04:50.491
Ohhh!

05:19.019 --> 05:21.121
( Exhaling sharply )

05:22.856 --> 05:24.024
( Groans )

05:27.294 --> 05:29.430
( Groans )

05:29.497 --> 05:31.432
Blake? You still here?

05:31.499 --> 05:32.633
Hey, Mr. Gable.
Hey.

05:32.700 --> 05:33.934
How was the game?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.604
Whoa! Look a little banged up.
Must have been sick!

05:37.605 --> 05:38.872
It was.
We don't play to lose.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.141
You guys won?
We did not.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.512
But it was sick.
Yeah.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.646
Whoa. You okay?

05:45.713 --> 05:47.381
Uh, yeah.
I just hurt the ankle playing.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.282
Hurt a lot more if the wife
finds out about it.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.418
Yeah. I get it.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.252
I had an ex-girlfriend
was the same way.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.121
Yeah, she would just
lose her mind

05:54.187 --> 05:56.056
every time
I went BASE jumping.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.026
Yeah,
this is just like that.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.297
( Sighs )

06:04.364 --> 06:07.234
You, uh...
you put the thing together.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.636
Yeah.
Is that a problem?

06:08.702 --> 06:11.539
I don't know if my wife's
gonna believe I did this.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.173
Really?
Yeah.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.477
I mean, I fought her
pretty hard on just
waiting for it, so...

06:16.544 --> 06:17.645
then I put it together?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.647
It just doesn't sound
like me, you know?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.815
Okay, well, I can
take 'er apart, chop-chop.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.350
No, you know what?

06:23.417 --> 06:25.385
Look, I-I'm a good guy.
I do a lot of stuff
around here.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.521
Let -- Let's roll the dice
on it. It's fine.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.623
All right, that's the spirit,
Mr. Gable.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.124
Wow.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.325
Sturdy, too, huh?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.994
( Laughs )
I do nice work.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.463
Yeah, you do.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.098
I just can't believe I didn't
bring it upstairs. ( Laughs )

06:40.133 --> 06:41.635
Upstairs?

06:41.702 --> 06:42.936
I think you did.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.104
Yeah!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.675
Donna: ( Gasps )

06:47.741 --> 06:49.710
You put the armoire
together?!

06:51.445 --> 06:53.447
It didn't
put itself together.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.184
Awwwww!

06:57.250 --> 06:58.819
You are amazing!

06:58.886 --> 07:00.721
I did nothing.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.490
No, you went
the extra mile.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.458
And I really appreciate it.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.760
Now, you come over here
and you give me a kiss.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.296
You get over here
and you give me a kiss.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.565
Okay.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.800
Aw, honey.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.502
I just want you to know
I'm really impressed.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.904
Well, you know what it is?
I like working with my hands.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.105
Oh?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.107
And that's the problem
with society now --

07:20.173 --> 07:21.842
nobody wants to work.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.976
Oh.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.245
Well, as long
as you have that attitude,

07:25.312 --> 07:27.781
how about putting up
the new spice rack, hmm?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.116
And could you take a look
at the gutters?

07:29.182 --> 07:32.385
I look at them every day.
They're up there.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.588
No, come on, please.
I mean, they really need
to be cleaned out.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.923
It's supposed to rain
this weekend.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.825
Really? I-I'm just -- I'm just
saying, I heard cloudy

07:37.891 --> 07:40.227
with, like, the sun
peeking through, you know?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.629
I just would hate
to do all the work

07:41.695 --> 07:42.830
and find out
it never rained.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.198
Ah! I get it.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.134
You act like
you don't want to do it,

07:47.200 --> 07:49.402
you're not gonna do it,
and then -- surprise!

07:49.469 --> 07:50.771
I come home,
and you did it.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.473
( Laughs )
You are so good. You are.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.775
Uh-huh.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.710
I guess you know
this one's a surprise now,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.411
so I probably
shouldn't do it, right?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.647
No. You should.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.149
Okay, I'm gonna do it.
I'll do it, yeah. Okay.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.689
( Sighs )

08:08.756 --> 08:10.423
Boy, you had a lot of leaves
up there.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.792
When's the last time
you cleaned those?

08:11.859 --> 08:12.893
Oh...

08:12.960 --> 08:15.162
Let's see. Jack is 10.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.364
We didn't have him yet.

08:17.430 --> 08:21.368
I'm gonna say somewhere
in the neighborhood of '03?

08:21.434 --> 08:23.470
I'm gonna get us some drinks.
You want a juice, soda?

08:23.537 --> 08:24.572
Surprise me.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.140
Beer it is.
Okay.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.578
( Door closes )

08:31.945 --> 08:33.914
Oh, Chale.
You're, uh, here.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.216
I thought
you were going to the city.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.720
Oh, uh, Mr. Gable,
do you think you could
have your handyman

08:39.787 --> 08:41.755
put a shim
under my air conditioner?

08:41.822 --> 08:43.023
It's rattling.

08:43.090 --> 08:46.760
Handyman? Uh... What --
What --- What handyman?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.162
The one on the roof,
cleaning the leaves.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.032
I believe
you call him Blake.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.003
Okay, um...

08:56.069 --> 08:58.205
This is serious,
and I need you
to listen to me, all right?

08:59.506 --> 09:02.542
There is no handyman.
There's no Blake.

09:02.610 --> 09:06.346
And if Donna asks, it was me
cleaning the gutters.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.414
You with me?

09:09.449 --> 09:11.384
Yes. Yes.
Okay.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.687
I am with you.
All right.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.723
So would you...
( Chuckles )

09:15.789 --> 09:19.559
...be able to put a shim
under my air conditioner?

09:19.627 --> 09:22.029
I can't
because I'm on the ladder,

09:22.095 --> 09:23.130
clearing the gutters.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.833
You remember?
We just -- just...

09:25.899 --> 09:27.868
The art of deception.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.402
I find this intoxicating.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.138
( Laughs )

09:33.741 --> 09:35.075
( Groans )

09:35.142 --> 09:36.409
Whoa!

09:36.476 --> 09:38.378
Your ankle's really blowing up
on you, huh?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.781
Oh, yeah, she's, uh, turning
some pretty wild colors.

09:40.848 --> 09:41.915
( Laughs )

09:41.982 --> 09:43.383
Well, Mr. Gable,
remember this.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.219
Pain is just weakness
leaving the body.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.423
That's a lot of weakness
right there.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.059
I think
the wife was right.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.762
My football days
are kind of behind me.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.765
What?! No. Mr. Gable,
I -- I'm -- I'm sorry.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.266
I respectfully disagree.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.701
I mean, you were a cop,

10:00.768 --> 10:04.271
out there, on the street --
danger around every corner.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.474
Adrenaline pumping
through your veins every day.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.211
Not every day.
Some days, we had to file.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.546
But the point is,
you don't just turn that off.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.482
I mean, I love
that you're out there,

10:15.548 --> 10:16.984
getting crazy
with your boys.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.787
I hope I'm that active
when I'm --

10:19.853 --> 10:21.989
What are you, 38?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.257
Give or take.
I mean, you know...

10:24.324 --> 10:26.093
Why don't you sit down,
have a beer,

10:26.159 --> 10:27.661
just relax
for a second, man?

10:27.728 --> 10:30.063
Thanks.
Yeah.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.464
So, uh,
tell me about you.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.400
Where'd you, uh --
Where'd you grow up?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.135
Where didn't I grow up?

10:35.202 --> 10:36.336
( Chuckles )

10:36.403 --> 10:37.437
My dad was
a career Marine.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.571
Wow.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.740
He, uh,
he lost his leg --

10:39.807 --> 10:40.874
My wife's here!
Get out of here!

10:40.941 --> 10:42.175
What?
Get down, get down!

10:42.242 --> 10:43.877
What?
Get down, quick! Lower.
Get out of here.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.345
Stay low, stay low.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.380
Do me a favor -- just grab
the garbage on the way out.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.782
That's be great.
Okay.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.453
Donna: Babe?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.388
Yeah, honey,
in the back.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.890
( Groans )

10:56.957 --> 10:58.158
( Gasps )

10:58.225 --> 10:59.259
( Groans )

10:59.326 --> 11:01.361
Ohhhh!

11:01.428 --> 11:03.797
Look at you go!
My man!

11:03.864 --> 11:05.298
Yeah!

11:05.365 --> 11:07.467
Oh, wow.
Was all that crap up there?

11:07.534 --> 11:09.336
Yeah, it was jammed in there
pretty tight.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.404
( Cellphone chimes
melodically )

11:12.906 --> 11:14.007
What's that?
Oh, it's a --

11:14.074 --> 11:16.676
Yeah, it's a Silver Alert.
Silver Alert?

11:16.744 --> 11:19.847
Yeah. You know,
it's like an Amber Alert,
but for old people.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.148
Oh.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.682
Some grandma is just --
she's lost in Ronkonkoma.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.817
She's gonna be fine.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.085
You don't get those
on your phone?

11:25.152 --> 11:26.954
No.
Oh, honey,
you should sign up for it.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.188
Yeah,
it takes a village.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.589
I got to go wash up.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.764
So, let me
get this straight.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.833
My face doesn't feel like
it's wrapped in barbed wire.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.236
It's just weakness
leaving my body?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.405
Yes! You're getting it now.
All right.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.440
My doctor took X-rays
and said

11:47.507 --> 11:51.812
that the jelly that goes
between my top
two vertebrae is gone.

11:51.879 --> 11:55.715
It's not the jelly
that's gone, guy.
it's weakness.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.818
No, he showed it to me --
it's jelly.

11:59.519 --> 12:00.788
You believe this?

12:00.854 --> 12:03.256
Don't worry.
I'm gonna be fine.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.159
I got what they call
a floating elbow.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.828
A lot of the top athletes
get it.

12:07.895 --> 12:09.797
( Sighs )

12:09.863 --> 12:11.932
Guys, all right, come on,
we can't let this
slow us down.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.000
We got to stay the course.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
Next week,
we're renting dirt bikes.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.736
No, no!
Mnh-mnh!
Yes!

12:16.804 --> 12:18.605
You guys
are killing me here.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.041
I hope you like truth
on your pizza,

12:21.108 --> 12:23.010
'cause you're about to get
a big bite.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.612
In life,
if you're not moving forward,

12:25.678 --> 12:26.713
you're moving backwards.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.615
There is no neutral.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.484
You watching Tony Robbins
commercials again?

12:31.551 --> 12:34.087
No, I'm telling you, even my
Chore Weasel, Blake, says it.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.089
You're still using
that guy?
Yeah. He's awesome.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.426
He's got an unbelievable view
on life, on living it, man!

12:39.492 --> 12:41.628
I mean, look at Enzo.
You know how
he stays so young?

12:41.694 --> 12:43.496
This -- hustling.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.965
He could be at home all day,
watching the Weather Channel,

12:45.032 --> 12:46.233
but he's not.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.734
He's out in the world.
He's making things happen.

12:47.801 --> 12:48.836
Enzo, how old are you?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.737
I'm 41.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.277
( Wheezing ) Really?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.348
That's got to be the heat from
the pizza ovens right there.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.953
I tell you what --
I'm getting Islander tickets
tonight, okay?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.754
Yeah, come on. A little
fighting, a little hockey.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.856
Who's with me?

13:08.922 --> 13:10.123
I'm not.
Kevin: What?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.558
Guy,
Google "floating elbow,"

13:11.624 --> 13:14.227
and you'll realize what
a stupid question that is.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.296
Yeah, I'm watching from
the safety of my mom's couch.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.198
All right, fine, but
I'm taking my Chore Weasel.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.567
If any of you guys
want to join us,
you're more than welcome.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.170
I would, but every time
I turn my head to the left,

13:23.236 --> 13:24.604
I smell toast.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.144
Hey, my clothes
didn't get soaked coming in.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.880
Did somebody fix
the sprinklers?

13:32.946 --> 13:35.115
Yeah -- your father.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.349
Wow. Really?
Yeah.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.450
Good for him.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.919
Yep,
he's been great lately.

13:38.986 --> 13:43.423
I ask him to do something,
and he just...does it.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.093
Huh.
That's weird.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.961
Wait, no complaining,
nothing?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.663
No. I mean, look.
He even put up the spice rack.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.765
Although, do you notice
anything strange?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.435
Yeah --
He put up a spice rack.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
Hello, ladies.
Donna: Oh!

13:57.237 --> 13:58.505
Chale,
you're here every day.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.140
Have you noticed
anything unusual --

14:00.207 --> 14:01.942
No, nothing.
No, nothing.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.243
Hmm.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.611
Wow. Good cover.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.979
Mom,
he knows something.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.048
No, I don't. I...going
back to the garage now.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.550
Nah.
Chale, sit down.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.519
Honey,
my mom said "Sit."

14:12.585 --> 14:13.820
You'd best sit.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.825
So,
what do you know?

14:18.892 --> 14:21.728
I know you have no right
to question me like this.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.265
You know what?
Mom, can you just give me
a second with him?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.399
Yeah.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.568
Hey, babe,
you want something to drink?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.003
I'd like that very --

14:30.070 --> 14:32.672
Are you doing
Good Cop, Bad Cop to me?

14:32.739 --> 14:33.941
Okay, listen.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.143
We know that you're keeping
a secret for my dad,

14:36.209 --> 14:37.945
so why don't you
just tell us?

14:38.011 --> 14:39.579
I've got nothing
to say.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.615
Oh, for crying out loud,
Chale, what do you know?!

14:42.682 --> 14:46.719
Now, I know Mr. Gable is
a big, scary man,

14:46.786 --> 14:49.822
but he ain't got nothin'
on this.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.992
His name's Blake.
The Weasel, the gutters.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.927
He wouldn't do the shim.
( Whimpers )

14:53.994 --> 14:55.595
Shh, shh.
Relax, relax.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.697
You have another sip
of water.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.569
Kevin:
Just right up here is fine.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.903
Are you sure? I can
take you to your driveway?

15:03.971 --> 15:06.539
No. No, no.
Here's fine. Here's good.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.308
Well, I got to say,
Mr. Gable,

15:08.375 --> 15:10.477
I-I've been an Islander fan
all my life

15:10.543 --> 15:12.345
and never sat
center ice before.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.680
It's the least I can do.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.216
I was, uh...I was pretty rough
on you the other day.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.152
And I can't believe
you got the puck!

15:19.219 --> 15:21.754
There must have been, what,
15 people fighting for it?

15:21.821 --> 15:24.124
You know, when I want
something, I gets it!

15:24.191 --> 15:26.159
( Both laugh )

15:26.226 --> 15:29.762
Yeah, and that one older lady,
she just did not
want to let go.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.165
You know what I learned
tonight about women over 60?

15:32.232 --> 15:33.766
They are ticklish!
Yeah.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.368
One little hit
in the ribs there,

15:35.435 --> 15:36.869
they cough it up
immediately.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.238
( Both laugh )

15:38.305 --> 15:39.906
Anyway,
I should, uh...

15:39.973 --> 15:41.041
I should probably
get going.
All right.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.942
Oh, hey, uh,
don't forget your puck.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.979
I think you mean
your puck.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.547
No.
Yeah.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.082
No!
Yes!

15:49.149 --> 15:51.184
( Both laughing )

15:51.251 --> 15:53.453
Wow! Oh. Ooh.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.488
I don't even know
what to say.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.657
You are awesome,
Mr. Gable.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.693
If you ever need anything,
you call me.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.496
Hey, guys.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.201
Probably not
gonna be calling you.

16:09.202 --> 16:11.704
What up, girlfriend?!

16:11.771 --> 16:14.441
Hang tight, 'kay?

16:17.910 --> 16:18.978
So, who's that?

16:19.046 --> 16:20.547
That would be
my friend Blake.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.382
Oh.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.451
He's not
your Chore Weasel?

16:24.517 --> 16:26.353
I don't know.
I don't label people.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.954
Hmm.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.657
Okay, it's not
what you think.

16:30.723 --> 16:34.027
I think you've been paying
this guy to do all the chores,

16:34.094 --> 16:35.862
and then you turn around
and take all the credit.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.164
Okay, it's exactly
what you think.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.431
Mm-hmm.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.500
I hired the guy the one time,
and you know what?

16:40.567 --> 16:42.502
You were just loving
all the work I was doing.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.904
Uh, I think you mean the work
the Chore Weasel was doing.

16:44.971 --> 16:47.974
Okay, from now on,
when I say "me,"
I mean "him," okay?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.214
So, the other day,
the gutters --

16:54.281 --> 16:55.515
did you actually do

16:55.582 --> 16:57.317
the whole fake "getting down
off the ladder" thing?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.886
I had to sell it.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.722
And when you were selling it,
how many rungs did you go up?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.557
Just the one.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.126
Mm-hmm.

17:06.193 --> 17:10.097
Okay, look,
I know it's stupid,
and I'm sorry, okay? I --

17:10.163 --> 17:12.499
I just don't understand
why you didn't do
the stuff yourself.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.900
I really
didn't give you anything

17:13.966 --> 17:15.235
that you couldn't handle.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.137
All of this is gonna become
crystal clear tomorrow,

17:17.204 --> 17:18.905
when you take me
to the orthopedic specialist.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.640
( Gasps )
You got hurt playing football!

17:20.707 --> 17:22.509
Okay, for someone
who knows all the answers,

17:22.575 --> 17:23.610
you ask
a lot of questions.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.078
Yes, I got hurt
playing football!

17:25.145 --> 17:26.813
I can't believe you.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.615
Look, I need the edge,
Donna, all right?

17:28.681 --> 17:29.782
It keeps me alive.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.251
Did you know Blake --
he thought I was 38?

17:31.318 --> 17:32.819
Oh, how much
are you paying him?

17:32.885 --> 17:33.953
Not that much.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.955
Oh, by the way,
did you know Enzo is 41?

17:36.022 --> 17:37.257
Really?!

17:37.324 --> 17:38.625
Yes.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.361
( Laughing ) Oh.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.629
Oh, look, babe,

17:42.695 --> 17:45.064
I know that you're just trying
to make me happy,

17:45.132 --> 17:46.199
and that's great.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.035
But, I mean, next time,
just talk to me.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.870
You got it. I will.
All right.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.373
Well, say good night
to your Weasel friend,

17:53.440 --> 17:55.308
and we'll see you inside,
okay?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.643
I love you.
I love you.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.777
All right.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.380
( Sighs )

18:00.447 --> 18:01.714
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.683
I just, uh,
had to set her straight.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.752
She doesn't get
how guys like us roll.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.754
Good. ( Laughs )

18:07.820 --> 18:10.590
Well, listen, thanks again
for the hockey game.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.991
You know,
most of my clients,

18:12.058 --> 18:13.826
they don't even give me
a thank-you,

18:13.893 --> 18:15.762
much less a magical evening
like this.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.063
I'm not most clients.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.998
No, you are not.
( Laughs )

18:19.065 --> 18:20.767
You have an awesome night,
Mr. Gable.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.968
All right, you too.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.804
( Cellphone
chimes melodically )

18:24.871 --> 18:26.373
Blake?
Hmm?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.540
What's going on there,
bud?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.509
Oh, that's just your receipt
for tonight,

18:29.576 --> 18:30.677
plus fuel both ways.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.212
Is there a problem
with the amount?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.380
Oh, gee, let me check.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.282
Yeah, it should be
a big, fat zero

18:35.348 --> 18:36.783
with a smiley face
next to it

18:36.849 --> 18:39.552
for showing you,
as you just said,
"a magical evening."

18:39.619 --> 18:41.454
Kevin,
I'm a Chore Weasel.

18:41.521 --> 18:43.856
So whether I'm waiting
on a delivery

18:43.923 --> 18:46.726
or escorting a lonely dude
to a hockey game,

18:46.793 --> 18:48.728
it's all $17 an hour.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.930
Lonely dude? I could have
taken a bunch of guys.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.899
You know --
Give me my puck back.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.701
Oh, hey, that's not cool.
You gave this to me.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.503
Fine. You know what?
Keep your puck if you want it.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.571
You know what -- As long as
it's about money for you,

18:58.638 --> 18:59.872
here's your tip anyway.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.140
Okay?
Keep that, as well.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.909
You know, I treated you
like a friend.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.744
I never treated you
like a Chore Weasel.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.546
You just did.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.250
( Cellphone
chimes melodically )

19:10.317 --> 19:12.919
You're charging me
for this argument?!

19:12.985 --> 19:15.488
What part of this process
are you not understanding?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.294
Hey.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.762
Are you okay?

19:22.829 --> 19:25.332
Yeah, no, I'm...

19:25.398 --> 19:27.099
I'm fine.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.568
You want
to talk about it?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.470
It's just...

19:30.537 --> 19:32.205
It's his birthday.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.941
Chore Weasel?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.976
Yeah.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.946
You know, you've forgotten
my birthday more than once.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.749
Okay, can we not make this
about you, please?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.551
I'm just going through some
stuff right now. That's all.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.085
Okay.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.854
Well, why don't you guys
just be friends on Facebook?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.088
I tried, okay?

19:49.155 --> 19:53.293
I sent him a request
to be friends, and just...

19:53.360 --> 19:55.595
nothing.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.730
( Cellphone chimes )

19:57.797 --> 19:58.965
Hey?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.706
Well, honey,
you'll find someone else.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.209
I will not
find someone else!

20:10.277 --> 20:12.612
I'm telling you --
You just don't understand!

20:15.047 --> 20:18.351
* Don't want
no sweet perfume *

20:18.418 --> 20:21.888
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move *

20:21.954 --> 20:24.090
* Do, do, do, do, do

20:24.156 --> 20:25.625
* Do, do, do, do

20:25.692 --> 20:29.228
* Ohhhhhh, yeah

20:29.296 --> 20:32.299
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes *

20:32.365 --> 20:34.934
* I just don't want no...
