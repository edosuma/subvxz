Alice:
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"Good Trouble"...</i>

00:02.252 --> 00:05.672
I just can't imagine us
not all sitting around
this table together.

00:05.672 --> 00:07.424
We are here today to witness

00:07.424 --> 00:10.761
the vows that Brandon
and Eliza will share
with each other.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.804
Callie:
<i>I took the job in L. A.</i>

00:12.804 --> 00:14.348
Lena:
<i>What about our house?</i>
<i>Our home?</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:16.016
Stef:
<i>It's a new chapter</i>
<i>for us, too.</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:19.019
<i>Hey, guys. It's Mariana.</i>
<i>We just made it to L. A.</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:22.356
Callie:
<i>The Coterie at the Palace</i>
<i>is an intentional community.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:24.191
Alice:
This is our communal bathroom.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.068
‐Please, I can explain.
‐Raj: I'm sure you can.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.903
You're the best
con artist I know.

00:27.903 --> 00:30.656
If Jazmin is
no longer your child
because she's trans,

00:30.656 --> 00:33.408
then I guess you have
no children at all,
because I'm bisexual.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.577
(speaking Spanish)

00:38.205 --> 00:40.249
I don't have a family
like yours.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.376
I can't be whatever
I want to be.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.044
Hey. Hey, whoa.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.463
(sobs)
I'm so messed up.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.174
They took us away
because she was strung out,

00:49.174 --> 00:50.968
and unfit to take care of us.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.052
I am not sorry!

00:52.052 --> 00:54.179
You remember her
dragging us to church
every Sunday

00:54.179 --> 00:56.390
no matter what shape
she was in?

00:56.390 --> 00:59.184
I had a son.
We lost him
when he was six.

<i>Drove out to this cliff</i>

01:01.353 --> 01:02.854

01:02.854 --> 01:04.690
Davia, I appreciate everything
you are trying to do,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.149
but you are suffocating me!

01:06.149 --> 01:08.443
‐What are you talking about?
‐You're my sister, Mariana.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.153
You're supposed to have my back.

So the, the Coterie's doing,
like, a crafts and...

03:30.168 --> 03:33.463
Cookie decorating booth,
as part of our community
service project.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.216
And I volunteered
to be in charge of it.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.468
And I got Speckulate
to sponsor us.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.137
And they're gonna
get us a Santa Claus,

03:40.137 --> 03:42.931
and toys, and a bunch
of other stuff.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.766
Wow, I'm... I'm impressed.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.018
You sound surprised.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
You know, contrary to what
some people might think,

03:49.020 --> 03:51.273
I'm not a manipulative
con artist who only
thinks of herself.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.941
Who said you're a con artist?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.317
Raj broke up with Mariana,

03:54.317 --> 03:56.695
because he thinks that she
went on a date with her boss

03:56.695 --> 03:58.071
behind his back.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.073
‐Did you?
‐No!

04:00.073 --> 04:01.366
Okay, well,
I went out with him,

04:01.366 --> 04:03.368
but it wasn't a date.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.245
And Raj did not
break up with me.
He just...

04:05.245 --> 04:07.539
left for India without
speaking to me.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.082
Well, as Anonymous said,

04:09.082 --> 04:11.460
"Be a good person.
Don't waste your time
proving it."

04:11.460 --> 04:13.628
I'm not trying
to prove anything.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.214
Here. Take a picture of me
for my Insta story.

04:19.176 --> 04:21.470
‐(camera shutter clicks)
‐There.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.890
Has Raj liked
any of your posts yet?

04:24.890 --> 04:25.974
No.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.810
Jesus is in Nepal?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.103
I thought he was in Tibet.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.938
Well, he should be here.
It's Christmas.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.274
‐I have to use the bathroom.
‐What, no quote for that?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.318
Ha, ha, ha.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.445
(phone chimes)

04:38.445 --> 04:40.071
Ugh, seriously?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.157
People keep bailing
on their shifts.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.617
I'm gonna need you
all day tomorrow.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.702
Do you think Moms'll
mind helping?
‐Oh, I'm sure they won't.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.871
If they ever get
their asses up here.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.539
Okay, you need to chill.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.042
They said they'd be here early,
and I need time to tell them

04:52.042 --> 04:54.169
I quit my clerkship
before we have to leave
for Jamie's.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.796
I don't know why
you haven't told them
already.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.048
‐It's not like they
can ground you.
‐You didn't tell them, did you?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.090
No.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.593
No, I did not tell them.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.512
I just, I wanted to explain

05:03.512 --> 05:05.639
my reasons
for quitting in person.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.766
'Cause I don't think
I was being impulsive.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.519
Okay, well, I'm sure we can
be a little late to Jamie's.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.604
No. We cannot.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.066
So my mom wants to
start the party at 4:00,

05:16.066 --> 05:18.652
so she and my dad can make
their early Christmas Eve
service in Newport.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.529
Mm. Can't wait.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.989
‐It'll be fine.
‐Mm.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.826
As long as we don't talk
politics or religion.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.203
Please don't tell my moms
you're a Republican.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.081
‐Okay. Please don't be late.
‐I'm never late.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.209
Your family tends to be
a little more flexible
about arrival times.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.378
And since this is the first time
my parents are meeting you...

05:36.378 --> 05:39.130
‐They've met me.
‐As my girlfriend.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.092
I just don't wanna
start the night off
on the wrong foot.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.178

33:07.485 --> 33:11.114
Oh, just that they
go together like,
like me and Jim.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.743
‐(both chuckling)
‐Oh, and Carter is
a Sigma‐Sigma Pi, too.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.411
Go, Sigs.

33:16.411 --> 33:20.040
So, uh, Jude,
did you join
a fraternity?

33:20.040 --> 33:23.585
Um, "the individual
has always had to struggle

33:23.585 --> 33:26.296
to keep from being
overwhelmed by the tribe."

33:26.296 --> 33:28.006
Nietzsche.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.969
It's hard enough
to own yourself

33:32.969 --> 33:36.723
without having to submit
to some group identity.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.560
‐Hmm.
‐Hmm.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.271
Well, she just got promoted

33:43.271 --> 33:45.315
to Associate Investment Analyst

33:45.315 --> 33:47.192
at Merrill Lynch
after only a year.

33:47.192 --> 33:48.652
I mean, of course
she's brilliant.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.278
She got her MBA at Stanford.

33:50.278 --> 33:53.073
‐Hmm.
‐And anyway, she wanted
to say hello.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.158
‐Who?
‐Callie and Diane:
Heather.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.246
(inhales)
So, uh, Callie,

33:59.246 --> 34:01.289
how is that clerkship going?

34:07.379 --> 34:10.173
She quit her clerkship? Why?

34:10.173 --> 34:12.550
I'm not sure,
but my moms don't know,

34:12.550 --> 34:15.303
so please, just,
don't say anything.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.850
Uh, it's going very well.
Thank you.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.479
Good, good.
It's a year deal, right?

34:24.479 --> 34:27.190
How much time
do you have left?

34:27.190 --> 34:29.442
About eight more months.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.569
And then the world
is your oyster.

34:31.569 --> 34:34.281
You know, I've heard
that once you've clerked
for a federal judge,

34:34.281 --> 34:36.241
‐you can pretty much
write your own ticket.
‐Aah.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.326
Yeah, that's what they say.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.331
What time is your,
uh, your church service?

34:43.331 --> 34:46.042
‐It's, um, oh.
This is your phone.
‐Lena: That's mine.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.045
Do not get identical phones.
We're always taking
each other's phones.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.256
‐So...
‐Shit.

34:51.256 --> 34:53.300
What? Is everything okay?

34:53.300 --> 34:55.635
They're cancelling
the Christmas festival.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.221
(sighs)

34:58.221 --> 34:59.431
‐(jingle bells on TV)
‐Santa on TV:
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.</i>

34:59.431 --> 35:02.309
This is like the saddest
Christmas ever.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.353
♪ Deck the halls
with bowels‐‐ ♪
Bowels.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.564
Bowels and poop.

35:07.564 --> 35:09.357
This is a shit Christmas.

35:11.276 --> 35:14.321
Okay. I think maybe
you've had enough <i>coquito.</i>

35:14.321 --> 35:16.573
Mariana:
<i>Has anyone seen Alice?</i>

35:17.907 --> 35:20.285
Okay, there you are.

35:20.285 --> 35:24.039
Okay. We need to have
the Christmas festival
at the Coterie.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.082
What? You mean our booth?

35:26.082 --> 35:28.043
No. The whole thing.
They lost their permit,

35:28.043 --> 35:29.961
and they're gonna cancel
unless we can save the day.

35:31.171 --> 35:34.049
‐I don't know.
‐Think about all of
the homeless people.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.011
And the kids whose mommies
and daddies are in jail.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.555
They're gonna be
so disappointed.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.476
Please. I have made so many
pipe‐cleaner reindeer,

35:44.476 --> 35:46.394
and this is my‐‐
our‐‐

35:46.394 --> 35:49.272
our chance to show that
we are good people,

35:49.272 --> 35:51.650
who are not manipulative
or selfish.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.238
Yes. L‐let's do it.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.532
‐Let's do it.
‐Thank you.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.493
(laughing)

36:01.493 --> 36:04.245
I mean, what do we‐‐
What do we have to lose,
anyway?

36:04.245 --> 36:06.039
Well, possibly our lease.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.750
(door opens)

36:09.417 --> 36:11.628
(truck beeping outside)

36:12.587 --> 36:14.422
Uh, can I help you?

36:14.422 --> 36:16.508
Yeah, I work
for the owner of
the building.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.634
Is the manager around?

36:17.634 --> 36:19.386
I'm the manager.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.221
You're Claudette Bourguinon?

36:23.098 --> 36:24.307
<i>Oui.</i>

36:24.307 --> 36:26.267
Uh, <i>oui, oui.</i>
Clau‐‐

36:26.267 --> 36:28.228
(chuckles)
Uh, uh, <i>pardon?</i>

36:28.228 --> 36:29.771
<i>Bonjour.</i>

36:31.231 --> 36:33.274
‐Uh. Oh.
‐(kissing)

36:33.274 --> 36:35.193
Whoa. (laughs)

36:35.193 --> 36:38.321
Ooh. <i>Ferrero rocher.</i>
(laughs)

36:38.321 --> 36:41.449
<i>‐Lumiere. Chocolat.</i>
‐Yeah, uh...

36:41.449 --> 36:43.034
Oh. Oh. (laughs)

36:43.034 --> 36:44.285
Oh.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.704
Uh, <i>charcuterie.</i>

36:45.704 --> 36:48.248
Uh, well, your lease is up.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.798
I'm kidding.
But this is gonna be

36:56.798 --> 36:58.883
the best Coterie Christmas ever.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.552
Thank you.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.143
‐(groans)
‐(kisses)

37:08.143 --> 37:10.437
‐Joey: There, there.
‐(Alice sniffles)

37:12.105 --> 37:14.065
(indistinct chatter)

37:17.235 --> 37:19.279
You can't just
walk out like that.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.156
You had no business
bringing him.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.532
<i>Abuelo</i> would have
wanted her here.

37:22.532 --> 37:24.826
Dad, do you know
he came to her <i>quince</i>

37:24.826 --> 37:26.077
and brought her dog tags?

37:26.995 --> 37:28.288
Mr. Martinez?

37:28.663 --> 37:31.541
‐What's happening?
‐We can confirm your father's
had a stroke,

37:31.541 --> 37:33.960
but we won't know how severe
any complications may be

37:33.960 --> 37:35.128
until he wakes up.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.505
What kind of complications?

37:37.505 --> 37:40.175
Well, there can be paralysis,
or loss of movement,

37:40.175 --> 37:43.845
speech.
Again, we won't know
until he wakes up.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.765
Is there a chance
that he won't wake up?

37:46.765 --> 37:49.768
Well, we're not anticipating
a worst‐case scenario, but...

37:49.768 --> 37:52.103
given his age,
I need to ask.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.897
‐Does he have a DNR?
‐What's that?

37:53.897 --> 37:57.233
An order not to resuscitate
in case he goes into
cardiac arrest.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.610
He doesn't have one.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.571
Then as next of kin,
the decision goes to you.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.825
I'll sign it.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.161
Excuse me.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.247
<i>Papi,</i> you can't do that.

38:11.247 --> 38:14.751
No.
(speaking Spanish)

38:14.751 --> 38:16.336
If he doesn't wake up,

38:16.336 --> 38:18.755
or isn't himself,
we have to let him go.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.176
<i>Papi's</i> right.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.303
He wouldn't want
to live like that.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.062
‐(Don and Kathleen
groaning)
‐Don: Oh, you're so hot.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.272
Kathleen:
Shh. Don't talk.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.774
‐Not so fast.
‐Don: Okay.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.484
‐Kathleen: Slower.
‐Don: Oh, sorry.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.736
‐Kathleen: Not so slow.
‐Don: I'll go faster.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.280
‐Kathleen: Oh, yes.
That's it. Right there.
‐(Don groaning)

38:44.280 --> 38:46.449
Kathleen:
Yes, yes, yes! Wait!

38:47.742 --> 38:50.537
I want my first orgasm
in this house to be
in our bedroom.

38:50.537 --> 38:53.373
‐(whimpers) Come on.
‐Don: Okay. Okay.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.295
(Don and Kathleen moaning
and groaning)

39:00.713 --> 39:02.090
Kathleen:
Don!

39:03.925 --> 39:06.261
‐(Kathleen moaning)
‐Wait, wait, wait.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.971
‐(Kathleen yells)
‐Okay.

39:08.888 --> 39:12.100
‐Kathleen: Oh! Oh!
‐(oven dings)

39:14.644 --> 39:17.313
Kathleen:
Oh! Like that.
Just like that.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.357
Oh! Oh! Oh!

39:23.945 --> 39:26.364
‐Shit.
‐Davia: We need 200.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.908
‐(cookies clattering)
‐(Kathleen moaning)

39:28.908 --> 39:30.326
(whispers):
What are you doing?

39:32.036 --> 39:34.163
‐(beeps)
‐Dennis: Davia.
Hurry it up.

39:34.163 --> 39:36.082
‐Davia: Hurry.
‐Dennis: Come on.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.834
‐Come on.
What are you doing?
‐(moaning continues)

39:37.834 --> 39:40.545
‐Dennis, they're gonna
be hungry after all that.
‐Kathleen: Oh! Oh!

39:40.545 --> 39:43.298
‐Go, go, go, go.
‐(door slides open)

39:43.298 --> 39:46.009
‐Kathleen: Oh! Oh!
‐Thank you for your home.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.804
I need to talk to you.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.723
I, I know I lied, all right?
I just...

39:51.723 --> 39:54.142
I couldn't tell Jamie's parents
I quit my clerkship.

39:54.142 --> 39:56.603
Yeah, that was lame.
But that's not what
I need to talk to you about.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.606
You might want to
sit down for this.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.317
‐(distant car honking)
‐Trust me.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.070
(clears throat)

40:08.156 --> 40:10.867
(exhales sharply)
Um,

40:10.867 --> 40:12.327
I was in Jamie's closet,

40:12.327 --> 40:15.163
‐and I was looking
through his drawers‐‐
‐You were what?

40:15.163 --> 40:16.789
‐It doesn't matter.
‐I think it does matter.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.124
Why were you going
through his drawers?

40:18.124 --> 40:20.335
That's not the point.
The point is...

40:21.711 --> 40:24.213
I found something.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.423
What did you find?

40:30.386 --> 40:32.055
Oh, my God.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.188
Oh, my God!

40:42.732 --> 40:45.026
Jamie's gonna ask you
to marry him.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.946
‐No.
‐Yes.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.283
Why would he even think
that we're ready to be...

40:52.283 --> 40:54.744
‐Engaged?
‐It's crazy.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.829
Okay, well,
he's crazy in love
with you.

40:56.829 --> 40:59.791
And holiday proposals
are very romantic.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.584
(exhales)

41:02.543 --> 41:04.462
What am I gonna say?

41:05.797 --> 41:08.800
Well, maybe you'll
surprise yourself
and say yes.
