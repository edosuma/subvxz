00:04.438 --> 00:06.171
(soft music)

00:08.942 --> 00:12.444
- Mr. Cuthbert,
do you know where she's headed?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.114
- The orphanage.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.117
(whistle blowing)

00:24.658 --> 00:26.792
(background chatter)
(woman): There she is.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.127
(man): Make way, make way!
(woman): Hi!

00:29.162 --> 00:30.996
(indistinct chatter)

00:42.509 --> 00:44.142
<i>- Did she run away?</i>

00:44.177 --> 00:45.777
<i>- No.</i>

00:45.812 --> 00:47.479
- How did she seem?

00:47.514 --> 00:48.980
- Quiet.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.349
She was real quiet.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.619
Didn't say a word.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.829
(indistinct chatter)

01:06.700 --> 01:09.134
- Miss. Miss.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.036
Right this way, miss.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.637
- Who are you?

01:12.672 --> 01:14.406
- I'm supposed to fetch you,
miss.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.208
- I don't understand.
Who sent you?

01:16.243 --> 01:19.411
- Why, your family, of course.
Now right this way, little lady.

01:19.446 --> 01:21.179
- My family?
- They sent me to collect you

01:21.214 --> 01:23.648
and bring you straight home.
We'll be there in a jiff.

01:23.683 --> 01:26.051
- Let go of me.
- Quickly now. Let's hurry up.

01:26.086 --> 01:30.055
I've got some lovely sweets in my carriage
for the ride. - Get away from me!

01:38.231 --> 01:40.298
- Ahem. Uh...
hello, young masters.

01:40.333 --> 01:43.235
I've been sent to take you home.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.608
(panting)

01:49.643 --> 01:51.543
(neighing)

01:51.578 --> 01:54.212
(background chatter)
- Oh, good evening.

01:54.247 --> 01:57.716
I was wondering if you
could spare a fresh horse?

01:57.751 --> 02:00.252
- Sorry, sir,
don't have one to lend.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.688
- Mine's dead beat and I need
to get to Charlottetown.

02:03.723 --> 02:06.324
Please! Any horse will do.

02:06.359 --> 02:08.960
- Sorry,
but I can't oblige you, sir.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.596
- I'm good for it. I'll bring
the money when I return.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.498
- Sir-- - I live in
Avonlea at Green Gables--

02:13.533 --> 02:15.700
- Money or not,
I'm afraid I can't help you.

02:15.735 --> 02:18.603
These here belong to the guests and the
hotels are spoken for this evening.

02:18.638 --> 02:22.474
You're welcome to rest yours here
for a spell, though. - Sam! Sam!

02:22.509 --> 02:24.309
Sam! Sam!

02:24.344 --> 02:26.545
Sam! Vessel?
- Whoa. Whoa there.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.614
Matthew Cuthbert, whatever's
got you all twisted up?

02:29.649 --> 02:31.983
- Are you heading to the vessel?

02:32.018 --> 02:34.653
- Yes, we're riding to the port overnight.
Be there by daybreak.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.689
- Can I hitch a ride?
I need to get to Charlottetown!

02:37.724 --> 02:40.859
- I'm not riding in back.
- No worries at all.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.794
Much obliged.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.098
Mare!

03:26.673 --> 03:28.506
<i>- Or I'll send you right back</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:30.575

03:30.610 --> 03:33.278

Quick!

Cuthbert, I was not quite finished.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.859
- Oh, please hurry!
Continue with the barn work.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.796
Stack some wood
in the kitchen. I have to go!

06:52.078 --> 06:53.478
- Marilla!

06:57.217 --> 06:58.683
Marilla!

06:58.718 --> 07:00.218
- I have to go!

07:00.253 --> 07:02.086
- Wait! Wait!

07:02.121 --> 07:03.621
Wait.

07:03.656 --> 07:06.558
Thomas rode out at first light.
I came to tell you.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.660
- Where is he going?
- Why, to look for them.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.930
Only reason I could see for Matthew
tearing off yesterday was to fetch Anne.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.299
When we didn't see them return,
I was so worried--

07:14.334 --> 07:15.834
- Please step aside, Rachel.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.837
- I knew you'd be beside yourself.
- I need to go! I must go now!

07:18.872 --> 07:21.673
- No, listen, dear. Thomas will ride
all the way to the train station.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.241
He'll check the road as he goes.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.043
- What if he's lying dead
in a ditch?!

07:25.078 --> 07:26.845
- Marilla-- - What if they both are?
- Enough now!

07:26.880 --> 07:29.080
- What if something horrible
has happened and it's my fault--

07:29.115 --> 07:31.917
- Stop it, Marilla.
Boy!

07:34.721 --> 07:39.624
Thomas is miles ahead of you. Now the
only thing to do now is to wait.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.827
Take the rig back in.
- Yes, ma'am.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.729
(whinnying)

07:46.733 --> 07:48.233
- Give me your hand.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.869
Watch your step.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.537
Careful now.

07:52.572 --> 07:54.206
Be careful.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.209
Now...

07:58.244 --> 08:00.078
come along inside.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.348
We'll put the kettle on.

08:32.579 --> 08:34.579

09:16.322 --> 09:18.657
(whinnying)

09:34.007 --> 09:37.809
- Hello, Mr. Avery.
- Oh, goodness! (laughter)

09:37.844 --> 09:40.712
My word! Do I know you?
- Not yet, but I know you.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.147
And I'm sure we'll become
better acquainted on the ride.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.083
- The ride?

09:45.118 --> 09:46.756
The matron was wondering
if you wouldn't

09:46.782 --> 09:48.553
mind taking me to the
nearest train station.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.522
I'm going home to Halifax, you see.
That's where I was born.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.092
- Ah.... I-I don't know
if I can take ya--

09:54.127 --> 09:57.195
- It seems a wealthy aunt was
just discovered and sent for me.

09:57.230 --> 09:58.763
Isn't that wonderful?

09:58.798 --> 10:01.599
- Yes, it is, but I've got
several deliveries to make--

10:01.634 --> 10:04.135
- My years of torment
and uncertainty are behind me.

10:04.170 --> 10:08.706
And I'll have to learn all manner of
comportment, but I feel equal to the task.

10:08.741 --> 10:10.875
- Certainly sounds like you're
moving up in the world.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.277
- I am. I am indeed.
So if you wouldn't mind

10:13.312 --> 10:14.712
conveying me
towards my new life?

10:14.747 --> 10:16.614
- It's not that I mind,
but trouble is,

10:16.649 --> 10:18.282
I've got several stops
along the way.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.118
It'll be a few hours,
I'm afraid.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.988
If you're in a hurry, you might find a
better mode. Shall we ask the matron?

10:24.023 --> 10:25.923
- No, no, no,
this will be perfect.

10:25.958 --> 10:30.695
And I'm sorry I don't have any money
to pay you, but I'll be happy to help.

10:32.799 --> 10:37.035
- Well, uh... well, al-alright.
Alright.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.970
Off me go.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.806

(whinnying)

11:26.486 --> 11:28.153
(bell clanging)

11:36.863 --> 11:39.163
- So, now, what do you think?

11:39.198 --> 11:43.234
- Don't know how much I can get
for it, with this here monogram.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.069
- I... I don't need much.

11:45.104 --> 11:47.072
- Then we are well met.
(chuckling)

11:47.874 --> 11:49.407
- It's a family heirloom.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.677
- Show me something in here
that ain't.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.612
I don't know.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.347
I'll think about it.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.717
Why don't you come back
tomorrow?

12:02.021 --> 12:04.756
- All I need is train fare
for two up-island

12:04.791 --> 12:07.291
and ferry rides back and forth
to the mainland.

12:07.326 --> 12:10.128
Any idea how much
that would come to?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.697
- I'll see what I can do.
Alright?

12:13.699 --> 12:15.800
- Extra, extra!

12:15.835 --> 12:18.136
Scientist predicts
greenhouse effect!

12:18.171 --> 12:21.672
Extra, extra! Scientist
predicts greenhouse effect!

12:21.707 --> 12:24.175
- What time does the ferry
to Nova Scotia go?

12:24.210 --> 12:25.843
- 'Round about 5:00.

12:25.878 --> 12:29.046
Local boy loses life
by drowning!

12:29.081 --> 12:31.549

(indistinct chatter)

12:31.584 --> 12:33.685
(soft music)

12:45.097 --> 12:46.964
(bicycle bell ringing)

12:46.999 --> 12:49.100
- Out of the way, mister!

12:50.636 --> 12:52.703
- Ah!

12:52.738 --> 12:54.539
(woman screaming)

12:54.574 --> 12:56.374
(people shouting)

12:56.409 --> 12:58.443
(neighing)
(barking)

13:05.885 --> 13:09.587
- And I believe my parents traveled
to India and many faraway lands

13:09.622 --> 13:12.723
before they were killed tragically
in service of the queen.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.325
- You don't say.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.061
- I imagine
they were ever so noble.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.564
Easy. Easy. Whoa.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.899
Alright, off you go.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.768
- Going!

13:25.271 --> 13:27.572
I'm told I'm fleet of foot.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.373
- Oh, yes?

13:29.408 --> 13:33.945
- Now, I'd rather be beautiful, but
you can't have everything. (laughter)

13:36.949 --> 13:39.250
- Alright.
(sighing)

13:39.285 --> 13:42.653
- Hop!
- Ah...

13:42.688 --> 13:44.188
(sighing)

13:44.223 --> 13:47.558
Mm. My missus sure can bake.
- Huh.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.293
I was going to learn.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.130
The lady at my last household in
Avonlea said she would teach me.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.632
- Hmm.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.334
- Doesn't matter.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.638
(sighing)
- Hungry?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.907
- No, no,
I couldn't deprive you.

14:02.942 --> 14:05.243
- Oh, help yourself.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.778
Got plenty.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.580
- Well...

14:09.615 --> 14:11.082
much obliged.

14:11.117 --> 14:13.284
- Walk on.
(horse snorting)

14:14.387 --> 14:17.588
- I'm famished, actually.
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.991
- Matron trying to starve you?
- What?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.460
- They didn't feed you
this morning?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.929
- Well...
I was too preoccupied to eat.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.798
What with my life
starting over and all.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.968
- Uh-huh.
What were they doing for her?

14:31.003 --> 14:33.304
- Who?
- Your parents, for the queen.

14:33.339 --> 14:35.139
- Oh, right.

14:35.174 --> 14:37.342
Espionage.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.947
- There. That's the best I can
do until the doctor comes.

14:42.982 --> 14:46.284
- It's been hours. I hope bringing
him here was the right thing to do.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.119
- Anne...
- He's waking up.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.987
- Fetch him some water.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.656
- Anne...
- It's alright.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.458
You're going to be fine.
- What? Where...?

14:54.493 --> 14:56.894
- You had an accident.
My carriage.

14:56.929 --> 15:00.231
- Oh, no, no, no, no...
I can't be late.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.500
- Don't get up. You're injured.
- No.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.470
The ferry. I can't miss it.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.439
Where am I?!

15:08.474 --> 15:10.875
Where's the ferry from here?

15:25.624 --> 15:27.525
(crickets chirring)

15:27.994 --> 15:30.194
(soft, dramatic music)

15:34.533 --> 15:36.367
Hello?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.570
Hello?

15:46.045 --> 15:47.545
Someone?!

15:56.355 --> 15:58.523
Hello?! Hello?!

16:22.882 --> 16:24.716
(groaning softly)

16:40.933 --> 16:43.101
(rooster crowing)

16:45.604 --> 16:47.171
Oh...

16:47.206 --> 16:48.706
- Oh, my word!

16:48.741 --> 16:50.941
- Please...
No, d-d-don't be frightened.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.877
- Get away!
You can't loiter here!

16:52.912 --> 16:55.880
- I must speak with the matron.
- The matron? She's not even awake.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.915
- It's an emergency.
- You'll have to come ba--

16:57.950 --> 17:01.118
- No, there's been a mistake!
My girl.

17:01.153 --> 17:04.221
My little girl, she's here.

17:04.256 --> 17:06.891
I came to fetch her.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.626
Please.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.565
- Come inside. I'll see
if I can rouse the matron.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.233
- Thank you.

17:16.268 --> 17:18.603
- Were you out there all night?

17:20.339 --> 17:22.239
What happened anyways?

17:22.274 --> 17:25.076
- There was a misunderstanding.
- Looks like it.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.744
(woman): Hurry up.
- I... What?

17:26.779 --> 17:30.081
- You've been fighting.
And at your age. Men!

17:30.116 --> 17:32.683
Kitchen's this way. Dora, please
tell Matron there's an emergency,

17:32.718 --> 17:34.518
someone needs to see her
right away.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.421
I'll give you a bit of hot water
for washing up,

17:37.456 --> 17:40.624
and we'll take a look at that
bandage before you see Matron.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.461
- Oh, no, there's no need.
- Have you seen you?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.663
- Uh... much obliged.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.266
(rooster crowing)

17:48.301 --> 17:50.169
(clucking)

17:56.643 --> 17:59.010
(cattle lowing)
- 'Morning, Miss Cuthbert.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.646
Do you need something?

18:04.818 --> 18:06.285
For me?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.663
<i>Merci.</i>

18:18.865 --> 18:20.532
- There's plenty more.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.035
- Thank you.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.441
- Yes? What is the nature
of your emergency?

18:29.476 --> 18:31.176
- Yes, good morning.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.411
I need
to take Anne Shirley home.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.014
- She was adopted.
She's no longer in residence.

18:36.049 --> 18:39.217
- But she... she came back here
yesterday, did she not?

18:39.252 --> 18:41.519
- She did not.
Now please excuse me.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.388
- But... she has to be here.

18:43.423 --> 18:46.825
The ferry master said
that he'd seen her,

18:46.860 --> 18:49.027
said she come across...
yesterday.

18:49.062 --> 18:50.562
Red braids!

18:50.597 --> 18:53.732
- Oh, I remember her distinctly,
but the girl is not here.

18:53.767 --> 18:55.567
Tsk. Emergency!

18:55.602 --> 18:57.602
(shouting in distance)

18:59.773 --> 19:01.339
- Oh!
(chuckling)

19:01.374 --> 19:03.174
Gave me a start.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.677
- Beg your pardon.
- Same thing happened yesterday,

19:05.712 --> 19:08.046
only that time
it was a little girl.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.255
<i>- "Where Hope and Fear</i>
<i>maintain eternal strife;</i>

19:17.290 --> 19:21.326
And fleeting joy
does lasting doubt inspire;

19:21.361 --> 19:26.598
And most we question,
what we most desire!"

19:27.934 --> 19:29.434
Thank you!

19:44.517 --> 19:47.119
(man): Ladies and gentlemen,
the express...

19:49.823 --> 19:51.456
- Excuse me.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.959
May I interest you
in a poetic recitation

19:54.994 --> 19:57.162
spoken aloud
with dignified emotion?

19:58.998 --> 20:00.632
It's only a dollar.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.500
Fifty cents?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.804
I need a train fare to Halifax.
I promise you'll like it.

20:05.839 --> 20:07.372
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

20:07.407 --> 20:10.875
May I interest you in a
rousing tale of heroic deeds

20:10.910 --> 20:12.644
and acts of bravery?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.514
It'll pass the time.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.850
(indistinct announcement)

20:22.155 --> 20:24.022
Pardon me.

20:24.057 --> 20:27.091
May I transport you
for a few minutes

20:27.126 --> 20:29.694
with a romantical recitation

20:29.729 --> 20:33.031
replete with the tragedy
of a love unrequited?

20:36.936 --> 20:39.103
"If thou must love me,

20:39.138 --> 20:42.607
let it be for nought
Except for love's sake only.

20:44.444 --> 20:48.046
Do not say,
'I love her for her smile -

20:48.081 --> 20:49.614
her look -

20:49.649 --> 20:51.883
her way
of speaking gently,-

20:51.918 --> 20:54.285
for a trick of thought
that falls in well

20:54.320 --> 20:57.755
with mine, and certes brought...
- Anne! Anne!

20:57.790 --> 21:01.192
- ...a sense of pleasant ease
on such a day--"

21:01.227 --> 21:02.961
- Anne!!

21:07.734 --> 21:09.834
- "For these things in
themselves may

21:09.869 --> 21:12.303
be changed,
or change for thee,-

21:12.338 --> 21:15.640
and love, so wrought,
may be un-wrought--"

21:15.675 --> 21:19.410
- Anne, thank goodness I found you.
(chuckling)

21:19.445 --> 21:22.380
- So Marilla must've found
the brooch, then,

21:22.415 --> 21:24.516
because I am not a thief.

21:24.551 --> 21:28.286
Now, if you'll please excuse me, I'm
in the middle of earning some wages.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.154
I've got a train to catch.

21:30.189 --> 21:33.758
"Thy love dear
wiping my cheeks dry--"

21:33.793 --> 21:37.095
- Please, Anne-- - "A creature
might forget to weep--"

21:37.130 --> 21:38.963
- It was a terrible
misunderstanding--

21:38.998 --> 21:41.399
- Thank you anyways.
It was very nice.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.801
- But I'm not finished.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.503
- We've heard quite enough.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.072
- Do you want your money back?

21:48.107 --> 21:50.108
- Anne, please...

21:50.143 --> 21:51.943
listen to me.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.946
I've come to take you home
to Green Gables.

21:54.981 --> 21:58.416
- Why?! So you can banish me
whenever you feel like it?!

21:58.451 --> 22:00.051
I am my own family now.

22:00.086 --> 22:01.886
And I am all I need!

22:01.921 --> 22:04.389
- Anne--
- Poems! Poems for sale!

22:04.424 --> 22:06.925
- No, wait, wait. Anne, listen.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.427
I-I've come for you.
I came all this way--

22:09.462 --> 22:13.431
- Oh, bully for you. Because so did I!
And not by choice.

22:13.466 --> 22:17.302
I had to come all this way
because you didn't want me!

22:17.337 --> 22:19.571
- I do want you, Anne.
We do.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.440
- I would appreciate it
if you would leave me alone.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.777
- Please.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.445
Please.
- Please?

22:27.480 --> 22:29.314
Oh, I'll give you a "please."

22:29.349 --> 22:31.650
Please have the decency
to let me be!!!

22:32.485 --> 22:34.486
- Is there a problem here?

22:35.655 --> 22:38.489
- Yes, there is.
- Is this man bothering you?

22:38.524 --> 22:40.091
- No, no...

22:40.126 --> 22:41.693
we're fine.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.828
- This man
is indeed bothering me.

22:43.863 --> 22:47.198
- That so.
- We're fine. She's my daughter.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.699
(soft music)

23:53.266 --> 23:55.100
(sniffling)
(sobbing)

24:36.776 --> 24:38.409
Whoa...

24:38.444 --> 24:39.978
(horse chuffing)

24:41.180 --> 24:43.114
(groaning)

24:43.149 --> 24:46.651
- Well, it certainly took you
long enough to fetch her!

24:46.686 --> 24:48.920
- Oh, sorry to...

24:48.955 --> 24:51.022
cause you worry, Marilla.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.126
- Hello, Miss Cuthbert.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.961
- Hello, Anne.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.263
It's nice to see you back.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.434
Please take your things up to your room.
I'll get supper on.

26:45.638 --> 26:48.539
We're having a simple supper.
I won't need your help.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.308
Just come down
when you're ready.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.012
- Yes, Miss Cuthbert.

26:55.047 --> 26:57.582
- Well, I'll see you downstairs.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.397
(birdsong)

27:14.734 --> 27:17.034
- You'll be wanting
the egg cups?

27:17.069 --> 27:19.036
- Yes, please.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.706
Did you bring your laundry down?

27:21.741 --> 27:23.741
- Yes, Miss Cuthbert.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.544
- Please attend to the toast.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.053
- Excuse me.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.589
- Of course.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.977
On the table, thank you.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.666
- I'll be out, uh...

28:55.701 --> 28:58.202
by the potato barns today.

29:05.478 --> 29:09.113
I might send Jerry to the
smithy with the bay for shoes.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.749
- I'll pack him a lunch.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.318
Alright.

29:14.887 --> 29:16.487
Alright, then.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.700
(birdsong)
(rooster crowing)

29:29.435 --> 29:31.703
- It was so awful, Belle.

29:32.705 --> 29:36.541
When I saw the orphanage again,
you can't imagine my dread.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.511
And now I'm back,

29:40.546 --> 29:43.014
but I'm not so sure...

29:43.049 --> 29:44.549
- You're back?

29:45.351 --> 29:48.953
- How dare you sneak around listening
to my private conversation?

29:48.988 --> 29:50.755
- I wasn't listening,
I was sleeping.

29:50.790 --> 29:55.359
- So you're lazy and a snoop.
- It was too late to go home last night.

29:55.394 --> 29:59.063
There was so much work, because Mr.
Cuthbert was away. Looking for you.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.665
- What all did you hear me say?

30:01.700 --> 30:04.935
- Why would I care
what you say to a horse?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.571
I need coffee.
I'm going in to ask.

30:07.606 --> 30:10.174
- Why do you have that plate?
- I--

30:10.209 --> 30:12.810
- Careful.
They'll call you a thief too.

30:12.845 --> 30:16.747
- No, no, the lady brought it to me
yesterday, when she was<i> distraite.</i>

30:16.782 --> 30:20.218
Why anyone would worry over you
is a mystery for sure.

30:32.631 --> 30:35.366
(soft music)
(panting)

30:36.502 --> 30:38.336
- Ah!
(laughter)

30:39.338 --> 30:40.971
Hey.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.808
- Ah... You're so smart, Anne.

30:43.843 --> 30:48.045
I never would've thought
to sell poems for train fare.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.548
And you're home in time
for the church picnic.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.817
Did they tell you
we're hosting it here?

30:52.852 --> 30:54.618
I'm really glad you're back,
Anne.

30:54.653 --> 30:58.189
- Well, you're the only one.
Well, Matthew seems to be,

30:58.224 --> 31:00.691
but he must've
talked her into it.

31:00.726 --> 31:03.494
- Oh, don't say that, Anne.
I'm sure it's not true.

31:03.529 --> 31:07.431
- Miss Cuthbert wasn't happy to see
me at all. She didn't care a whit.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.200
- But... Rachel Lynde
told Mother

31:09.235 --> 31:12.403
that Miss Cuthbert
was torn asunder after you left.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.573
- Not possible.
- Miss Cuthbert was so upset,

31:15.608 --> 31:18.309
Rachel Lynde feared
she'd take sick.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.344
- Not possible.

31:21.847 --> 31:24.315
- Well,
that's what she told Mother.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.150
- Then why doesn't she show it?

31:26.185 --> 31:28.052
It's hard to believe
she was sorrowful

31:28.087 --> 31:30.521
when she doesn't seem
to like me at all.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.723
- At least you're home.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.064
I've missed you.

31:43.736 --> 31:46.137
- And I don't mean
to seem ungrateful.

31:46.172 --> 31:51.041
And it did fill my heart with
joy to be back at Green Gables.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.210
(laughter)

31:53.245 --> 31:55.246
(sighing)

31:57.416 --> 32:00.918
But I feel they could send me
away at any moment.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.523
- But now that it's all settled,
why would they?

32:07.793 --> 32:10.227
- I just don't want
to get too attached.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.396
Not if it's all going
to disappear.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.401
- Catch.

32:18.571 --> 32:20.404
(laughter)

32:33.085 --> 32:36.253
- "If all the world hated you,
and believed you wicked,

32:36.288 --> 32:40.758
while your own conscience approved
of you and absolved you from guilt,

32:40.793 --> 32:43.528
you would not be
without friends."

32:51.637 --> 32:53.471
(soft music)

33:04.416 --> 33:06.250
(distant chatter)

33:07.353 --> 33:08.920
(laughter)

33:11.423 --> 33:13.057
- It's quite confounding.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.759
Why send her away
just to retrieve her?

33:15.794 --> 33:17.761
- Confounding indeed.

33:17.796 --> 33:20.764
I hope those old Cuthberts
aren't losing their marbles.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.767
- What do you mean? Stop it.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.404
- Stop it! - I mean, I hope
they aren't becoming addled,

33:27.439 --> 33:29.940
dear,
as seniors are wont to do.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.775
- They hardly want to, darling.

33:31.810 --> 33:33.877
- I don't like this biscuit.

33:33.912 --> 33:35.613
- Then don't eat it.

33:35.648 --> 33:38.449
Well, it can't be a peaceable
household, it simply can't.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.484
The girl is an orphan,
after all.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.319
How does one know
what one is really getting?

33:42.354 --> 33:44.088
- One doesn't.
- Exactly.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.757
- It's not like she wanted
to be an orphan.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.826
- Of course not, dear.
But she is.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.701
Ah-ah.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.813
Hello!

34:09.682 --> 34:12.383
- Rachel. Thomas.

34:13.986 --> 34:17.989
- Here we are, here we all are.
Glad to see you, Matthew.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.691
Welcome home, Anne.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.427
- Thank you, Mrs. Lynde.
How do you do, Mr. Lynde?

34:23.462 --> 34:26.163
- Glad we didn't find you
in a ditch.

34:26.198 --> 34:28.565
- Yes, yes, dear, everyone
appreciates your gallantry.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.100
- Well, we aim to please.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.736
- Marilla, I hope you're feeling
better now, dear.

34:32.771 --> 34:36.173
- Were you poorly, Marilla?
- She was just worried sick, that's what.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.776
- All is well, thank you.
- I'm sure it is,

34:38.811 --> 34:41.378
now that you're all reunited.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.514
One big happy family.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.182
- My, my.

34:45.217 --> 34:48.185
Looks like the Cuthberts
have picked up a stray.

34:48.220 --> 34:50.187
- Stray dog. Ruff-ruff!

34:50.222 --> 34:51.922
- No need to be uncharitable.

34:51.957 --> 34:54.958
Do you suppose they mean for her
to be a daughter or a servant?

34:54.993 --> 34:56.593
- Doesn't she have
awful red hair?

34:56.628 --> 34:58.662
I wonder
if she'll be attending school.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.798
- What is the world coming to?

35:00.833 --> 35:05.035
(man): I hear they plucked her
from an asylum in Nova Scotia.

35:05.070 --> 35:07.171
- A lunatic asylum?
- Orphanage.

35:07.206 --> 35:11.442
Of course, it could turn out
to be one and the same.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.177
(woman): Oh, dear.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.513
- We'll just have to...
persevere.

35:16.548 --> 35:21.318
(singsong): You're a little orphan!
You lived in a trash can!

35:21.353 --> 35:24.021
(giggling)
Garbage girl! Garbage girl!

35:24.056 --> 35:25.956
(laughter)

35:25.991 --> 35:27.758
- Anne?

35:29.928 --> 35:31.495
I'll go.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.002
(soft music)
(crying)

35:39.037 --> 35:40.938
(panting)

35:57.456 --> 35:59.457
(Anne sobbing)

36:08.267 --> 36:09.900
Anne?

36:09.935 --> 36:12.269
(tearfully): Leave me alone.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.204
- Anne...

36:14.239 --> 36:16.740
- Did you feel a sense
of obligation?

36:16.775 --> 36:18.308
Is that it?

36:18.343 --> 36:20.744
Because I would've been fine
on my own!

36:20.779 --> 36:22.613
Better than here!

36:22.648 --> 36:27.317
Why would you send for me
if you didn't even want me?

36:27.352 --> 36:29.753
- But we do want you, Anne.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.422
- It's obvious you don't!

36:32.458 --> 36:34.792
I don't know what to do.

36:41.834 --> 36:44.502
- I have a question for you.

36:45.838 --> 36:47.805
I wonder...

36:47.840 --> 36:50.040
will you forgive me?

36:52.311 --> 36:56.080
I am very sorry, Anne.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.951
When the brooch went missing,
I was quick to judge.

37:00.986 --> 37:05.055
But what's worse
is that I pushed you to fib.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.291
What else were you to do?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.162
Makes me shudder
to think of it.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.066
And of course, I know now
that you were telling the truth.

37:16.101 --> 37:20.838
You are a truthful girl, Anne,
even now,

37:20.873 --> 37:23.674
and that
is an admirable quality.

37:33.185 --> 37:34.985
(sighing)

37:35.020 --> 37:36.687
This was my fault.

37:36.722 --> 37:40.390
And all that you went through
because of it.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.562
It's a wonder you came back to
Green Gables at all. (sniffling)

37:46.899 --> 37:48.566
(sniffling)

37:59.711 --> 38:01.412
(sniffling)

38:07.185 --> 38:08.853
(birdsong)

38:10.188 --> 38:11.956
(soft music)

38:19.231 --> 38:23.033
If you could...
find it in your heart to...

38:23.068 --> 38:25.035
believe me...

38:25.070 --> 38:26.703
and...

38:26.738 --> 38:28.372
forgive me...

38:30.409 --> 38:33.744
...then we can start anew.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.638
(seagulls cawing)

39:00.673 --> 39:03.207
<i>- Anne?!</i>
<i>- Yes, Miss Cuthbert?</i>

39:03.242 --> 39:05.577
- Please come down
to the parlour.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.380
And "Marilla" is just fine.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.049
- What do you mean?

39:11.084 --> 39:13.051
- You may call me Marilla.

39:13.086 --> 39:15.887
- Oh.
May I call you Aunt Marilla?

39:15.922 --> 39:17.455
- You may not.

39:17.490 --> 39:19.991
- But I'd love
to call you Aunt Marilla.

39:20.026 --> 39:23.328
It would make me seem
as if I really belonged to you.

39:23.363 --> 39:25.830
- Well, I'm not your aunt
and I don't believe

39:25.865 --> 39:28.333
in calling people names
that don't belong to them.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.835
- Well, we could imagine you're my aunt.
- I couldn't.

39:30.870 --> 39:34.205
- Do you never imagine things
are different than they are?

39:34.240 --> 39:36.274
- I do not.

39:36.309 --> 39:39.010
- Oh, Marilla,
how much you miss.

39:40.146 --> 39:41.980
- Well, speaking of names,

39:42.015 --> 39:46.318
we'd like you to sign this
and take ours.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.487
If the idea appeals to you.

39:51.324 --> 39:54.492
- I've got the pen.
It's all ready for you.

39:54.527 --> 39:57.028
- This is your family Bible.

40:00.033 --> 40:02.333
You want me to be a Cuthbert?

40:02.368 --> 40:04.402
A real Cuthbert?

40:04.437 --> 40:08.039
- We do. We want our name
to belong to you.

40:09.142 --> 40:14.212
- I'm going to belong? - We hope you
like the sound of Anne Shirley Cuthbert.

40:15.448 --> 40:17.315
Anne?

40:17.350 --> 40:20.018
- I do. I do very much.

40:20.053 --> 40:22.520
But... I just sign?

40:22.555 --> 40:24.255
That's it?

40:24.290 --> 40:25.857
- Of course.

40:25.892 --> 40:27.592
What's the matter?

40:27.627 --> 40:31.162
- Well... seems a little
perfunctory, don't you think?

40:31.197 --> 40:32.664
- Perfunctory?

40:34.100 --> 40:37.935
- Shouldn't we... shouldn't we
hold hands over a running stream

40:37.970 --> 40:41.472
and pledge ourselves to each
other as Cuthberts forever?

40:41.507 --> 40:44.142
Or prick our fingers
and mingle our blood

40:44.177 --> 40:46.511
as a symbol
of our lasting devotion?

40:48.881 --> 40:52.550
Well, surely there needs
to be a ceremony of some kind

40:52.585 --> 40:54.919
in honour
of such an auspicious moment.

40:54.954 --> 40:58.656
As someone who has
never belonged to anyone before,

40:58.691 --> 41:02.894
I believe that this is a matter
of much solemnity.

41:02.929 --> 41:04.562
Don't you?

41:09.936 --> 41:12.236
- What say you, Marilla?

41:12.271 --> 41:16.841
- Well... I've got some raspberry
cordial in the pantry.

41:16.876 --> 41:19.911
Perhaps we could all have
a small glass to celebrate

41:19.946 --> 41:22.013
without any danger to anyone.

41:22.048 --> 41:23.915
- Oh, Miss Cuth...

41:23.950 --> 41:25.583
Thank you, Marilla.

41:25.618 --> 41:27.452
That would do nicely.

41:28.221 --> 41:29.854
Well, then...

41:29.889 --> 41:31.789
to the Cuthberts.

41:31.824 --> 41:35.126
- The Cuthberts.
- And the Shirley-Cuthberts.

41:39.165 --> 41:40.798
Oh...

41:40.833 --> 41:43.501
I could develop a fondness
for this.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.872
- It's time for you to sign now,
Anne.

41:58.017 --> 41:59.684
- Oh my.

42:01.788 --> 42:04.489
I can't believe
this is really happening.

42:05.458 --> 42:07.792
- Calm yourself, Anne.
You're overexcited.

42:07.827 --> 42:09.327
- Yes, I am.

42:11.531 --> 42:15.600
I don't think I've ever been
so excited in my whole life.

42:16.636 --> 42:19.237
(sniffling)
Oh...

42:19.272 --> 42:21.072
my hands are shaking.

42:22.175 --> 42:24.475
Hoo.

42:24.510 --> 42:26.344
With this pen...

42:27.346 --> 42:29.147
...I take you...

42:29.182 --> 42:32.016
Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert...

42:33.686 --> 42:36.020
...to be my family forever.

42:38.858 --> 42:41.125
To call you mine...

42:41.160 --> 42:43.427
and to be yours.

42:43.462 --> 42:45.029
For always.

42:47.066 --> 42:49.233
(Anne sighing)

42:49.268 --> 42:51.269
(sniffling)

42:52.405 --> 42:54.072
Anne...

42:56.909 --> 42:58.743
...Cuthbert.

43:00.246 --> 43:03.414
(sniffling)
Oh, I should add the Shirley.

43:03.449 --> 43:05.416
I'll do it over.

43:05.451 --> 43:07.652
Anne...

43:07.687 --> 43:10.154
Shirley...
(laughing)

43:10.189 --> 43:12.357
...Cuthbert.

43:15.595 --> 43:18.296
It should be hyphenated,
don't you agree?

43:18.331 --> 43:21.966
I'll add that in, too.
And since it's official,

43:22.001 --> 43:26.871
it should probably be Anne Shirley-Cuthbert
of Green Gables née Halifax.

43:26.906 --> 43:29.941
- Anne.
- Could I add Cordelia, too?

43:29.976 --> 43:33.010
I've always wanted
to be a Cordelia.

43:33.045 --> 43:34.612
Anne...

43:34.647 --> 43:36.214
Cordelia--

43:36.249 --> 43:38.683
- Alright, that's enough now.

44:01.774 --> 44:03.741
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal

44:03.776 --> 44:05.743
(grunting)
- Ah!
