00:10.958 --> 00:14.000
"I paint what I see" is a painter's maxim,

00:14.083 --> 00:18.041
and one that reveals to us
the many layers of our world.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.500
Because behind everything beautiful
lies the dark.

00:36.583 --> 00:40.416
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
but what about the horror?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.541
We ascribe these visions
to a feverish imagination.

00:45.041 --> 00:47.166
A whim, a folly.

00:47.666 --> 00:49.333
But what if they are not?

00:49.416 --> 00:51.708
What if they are a careful record,

00:52.208 --> 00:53.083
a warning,

00:53.750 --> 00:55.166
or a family album?

00:55.666 --> 00:58.583
Our tale tonight is "Pickman's Model,"

00:58.666 --> 01:01.125
and its director, Keith Thomas.

02:16.666 --> 02:19.416
How much longer
must I keep my neck like this?

02:19.500 --> 02:21.125
You can't rush perfection.

02:23.208 --> 02:26.166
And you wouldn't wanna end up
with one hill bigger than the other.

02:28.458 --> 02:29.500
You wouldn't dare.

02:35.666 --> 02:37.583
Thought you gave the girl the morning off.

02:37.666 --> 02:38.500
Rebecca?

02:40.333 --> 02:41.500
Don't you dare.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.625
Mmm…

02:43.708 --> 02:45.250
Rebecca, where are you?

02:45.750 --> 02:47.625
Up here, Papa!

02:52.708 --> 02:53.916
Mm-hmm.

03:31.625 --> 03:32.833
Thurber, Thurber.

03:32.916 --> 03:35.583
Thank God. Save me from these philistines.

03:35.666 --> 03:36.916
Oh, come now.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.916
We were just discussing
the Impressionists.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.250
Smithfield here was busy
railing against Cézanne.

03:41.333 --> 03:43.958
All I said is
I don't see what the fuss is about.

03:44.041 --> 03:46.458
My father saw his exhibition
in Paris two summers ago.

03:46.541 --> 03:47.875
He said it was rotten.

03:49.166 --> 03:53.000
Do you see what I'm dealing with? Rotten?!

04:03.791 --> 04:06.666
Places, gentlemen. You are on my time now.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.125
Before we begin,
I have some announcements.

04:14.375 --> 04:18.791
The deadline for this year's
student art prize approaches.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.791
For those of you
unaware of its importance,

04:21.875 --> 04:25.291
the work judged to be the best
by the committee

04:25.375 --> 04:28.625
will be put on display at Arkham Gallery

04:29.791 --> 04:33.541
to be seen by critics and patrons alike.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.500
This kind of opportunity
can be the making of a young artist,

04:40.208 --> 04:42.791
as I am sure
last year's winner can attest.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.500
Mr. Thurber?

04:45.375 --> 04:46.250
Quite, sir.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.291
Also,

04:52.291 --> 04:55.583
starting today,
we have a new addition to our class.

04:57.291 --> 04:59.041
Mr. Pickman,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.083
if you'll find an empty space.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.666
If you are all ready.

05:29.583 --> 05:32.083
Our 15 minutes begins…

05:32.791 --> 05:33.625
now.

05:46.541 --> 05:48.416
Draw what you see.

05:57.125 --> 06:00.708
Be aware of the empty space
near the bicep.

06:04.166 --> 06:05.958
Remember your basic shapes.

06:09.083 --> 06:12.208
Construct, don't shade.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.541
Remember, the neck is a limb.

06:24.916 --> 06:26.583
Four minutes remaining.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.375
My time, Mr. Thurber.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.291
Or have we finished already?

07:33.125 --> 07:36.208
I just fail to see
what's so interesting about them.

07:36.291 --> 07:39.125
That's because you lack imagination.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.000
It's why Thurber here
keeps taking your money at cards.

07:44.375 --> 07:45.291
Full house.

07:47.333 --> 07:51.041
I'd say you fellas could use
a little of the new kid's imagination.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.000
New kid?

07:52.666 --> 07:53.791
Pickman?

07:53.875 --> 07:56.625
That guy's got to be
at least 80 years old.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.041
And from what I hear, he's a wet fish.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.375
Old New England money.

08:00.458 --> 08:03.958
-Not that you'd be able to tell.
-I heard his mother's from Arkham.

08:04.041 --> 08:04.875
Mm!

08:04.958 --> 08:09.208
A friend has it that she died
of a grizzly suicide when he was a boy.

08:09.958 --> 08:12.000
His father went mad shortly after.

08:13.541 --> 08:14.750
Thanks to his inheritance,

08:14.833 --> 08:17.416
he's been rambling around Europe
for the past decade.

08:20.083 --> 08:20.958
Well!

08:21.625 --> 08:25.708
If his piece today was any indication,
he won't make it at Miskatonic.

08:25.791 --> 08:28.666
I mean, the entire point of the class
is to draw what you see,

08:28.750 --> 08:30.291
not rotting flesh.

08:30.375 --> 08:34.333
-Perhaps that is what he saw.
-The man does draw in the cemetery.

08:45.958 --> 08:48.375
Early in the evening to be grave-robbing.

08:49.583 --> 08:50.791
It's Pickman, right?

08:54.125 --> 08:54.958
Richard.

08:56.083 --> 08:56.916
Well,

08:58.166 --> 08:59.000
Dickie…

09:01.750 --> 09:03.125
what do you have there?

09:07.875 --> 09:10.166
I think the rats got to her.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.166
Well, something certainly did.

09:15.583 --> 09:16.500
Eugh.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.625
So do you do this kind of thing a lot?

09:24.416 --> 09:26.791
Haunt cemeteries in the dead of night?

09:28.041 --> 09:29.791
'Cause your imagination is…

09:33.333 --> 09:36.000
I saw the piece
you did in Bosworth's class.

09:38.458 --> 09:39.458
You're very good.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.125
Well, I'm not sure he'd agree.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.625
If there's one thing
Bosworth can't abide in his students,

09:45.708 --> 09:47.000
it's talent.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.875
He seems to like your work.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.125
You thinking about entering the art prize?

09:57.625 --> 10:00.458
You, uh… You really should. It's, uh…

10:01.875 --> 10:03.250
quite the opportunity.

10:03.833 --> 10:07.375
Oh, I'm not very interested in prizes.

10:08.625 --> 10:11.833
Then what are you interested in, Dickie?

10:37.875 --> 10:38.958
These are…

10:42.875 --> 10:43.708
powerful.

10:47.541 --> 10:51.250
The darkness, the ugliness,

10:51.333 --> 10:52.666
the corruption.

10:54.666 --> 10:56.875
Suffering is living.

10:57.458 --> 11:00.000
We cannot let sympathy

11:00.500 --> 11:02.291
or altruism

11:02.375 --> 11:06.000
shield us from finding
the truths of this world.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.375
Oh, come on now.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.791
Don't keep it a secret.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.833
Where does one find these, uh,

11:19.916 --> 11:21.291
elusive truths?

11:34.583 --> 11:36.166
Where fear lives.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.541
Ah, I see you're tardy as usual.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.958
What, you're not submitting?

12:18.041 --> 12:21.166
I decided to give the rest of you guys
a chance to impress.

12:23.166 --> 12:26.541
-So how goes it?
-Oh, brutally of course.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.791
Smithfield is proclaiming
he has it in the bag.

12:31.958 --> 12:33.125
Any sign of Pickman?

12:33.208 --> 12:34.583
-He's in with them now.

13:07.458 --> 13:08.291
Dickie?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.041
It's the wrong audience for my work.

13:16.416 --> 13:17.541
Sorry.

13:17.625 --> 13:23.916
I'm beginning to doubt
these people truly have anything to teach.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.333
We have a…

13:29.375 --> 13:31.375
well, sort of a ritual,

13:31.458 --> 13:34.041
me and some of the others,
after a brutal critique.

13:34.541 --> 13:36.916
A little… fun.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.208
-Would you…
-You should join us.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.041
…like to see my paintings?

13:43.666 --> 13:44.500
I would.

14:15.750 --> 14:16.666
You, uh…

14:18.166 --> 14:19.583
You never showed these.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.750
Yeah. Come.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.125
This work's a little stronger
than what you've seen.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.333
My family have been
in New England for generations,

14:38.416 --> 14:40.291
since before the witch trials.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.875
My mother told me stories as a boy.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.500
Family stories.

14:49.083 --> 14:52.500
My great-grandmother's great-grandmother,

14:52.583 --> 14:53.708
Lavinia.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.750
She was branded a hex.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.500
A sorceress.

15:02.625 --> 15:04.250
Burned at the stake.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.458
The family gossip claims

15:14.541 --> 15:18.500
Lavinia killed her husband during a rite,

15:19.625 --> 15:25.416
then served his still-warm flesh
to members of her coven.

15:33.958 --> 15:37.625
Sometimes, when I'd wake in the night…

15:41.083 --> 15:43.041
…I'd hear them through the floor.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.791
Sounds of their party.

15:53.875 --> 15:55.833
-Do you hear that?

15:59.625 --> 16:00.958
Do you hear them, Will?

16:01.541 --> 16:04.750
-I…
-Beneath us, in the earth, my kin…

18:20.958 --> 18:22.125
Tough night, Will?

18:23.583 --> 18:25.500
You do realize it's afternoon?

18:27.250 --> 18:28.125
Oh, shit.

18:28.916 --> 18:30.916
Oh, sh… shit!

18:35.875 --> 18:36.708
Excuse me.

18:39.166 --> 18:41.708
-So lovely to see you!

18:44.750 --> 18:47.375
-The party's almost over.
-I know. I'm… I'm sorry.

18:48.416 --> 18:49.375
I'm here now.

18:49.458 --> 18:52.208
-Everything okay?
-Of course. Why?

18:52.875 --> 18:54.416
Whiskey. Whatever you got.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.291
What? I'm just
getting into the swing of it.

19:00.375 --> 19:01.875
Come. We've been waiting.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.291
Will, this is my aunt, Mrs. Creighton.

19:07.375 --> 19:10.875
Aunt Lizzy, this is my friend
William Thurber.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.541
My dear niece Rebecca
swears you're quite the artist.

19:17.208 --> 19:20.125
Would you excuse me for a moment?
I'm just gonna go find Papa.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.250
Of course.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.958
She's a remarkable young woman.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.666
So, William, tell me about your art.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.291
Rebecca says you specialize in portraits,
which I happen to adore.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.666
I've sat for many a portrait in my…

19:36.791 --> 19:38.708
Oh. Are you all right?

19:44.833 --> 19:45.666
Excuse me.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.458
-Will.
-Ah! Uh…

19:59.125 --> 20:00.250
I'm sor….

20:00.916 --> 20:01.833
Uh…

20:02.416 --> 20:04.958
I'd… I'd like you
to meet my father Charles.

20:05.625 --> 20:08.125
-Hello, William.
-Pleasure to meet you, sir.

20:20.416 --> 20:21.500
-Ah!

20:25.333 --> 20:26.541
Excuse me, sir.

20:27.541 --> 20:29.958
-Steady on!
-Are you all right?

20:37.208 --> 20:38.041
Will?

20:39.416 --> 20:40.250
Will!

20:42.083 --> 20:43.500
Will, stop!

20:44.166 --> 20:45.333
-What is wrong?
-I just…

20:45.416 --> 20:46.333
I…

20:47.666 --> 20:49.500
-What?
-That… That woman.

20:49.583 --> 20:52.250
The woman with… with…
with your father, she…

20:56.250 --> 20:59.291
No, see, she's not…

21:08.625 --> 21:09.458
How di…

21:13.166 --> 21:16.625
What is <i>happening </i>to me?

21:16.708 --> 21:18.500
Last night, the… the painting…

21:27.333 --> 21:28.625
I'm s… I'm sorry.

21:28.708 --> 21:31.250
I'm… I'm… I'm so sorry.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.500
Are you? I mean,

21:38.625 --> 21:40.750
you knew how important this was to me.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.291
-You show up drunk.
-I'm not--

21:43.375 --> 21:45.708
That's my father! That's my father!

21:47.958 --> 21:48.916
I know.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.375
You should go.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.916
Please. Please, please don't.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.375
This was such a mistake.

22:02.583 --> 22:04.750
I don't even recognize you anymore.

22:19.625 --> 22:20.458
Dickie.

22:23.833 --> 22:24.666
Dickie!

23:19.916 --> 23:24.375
Joe, it undermines the very traditions
of European craftsmanship.

23:24.458 --> 23:27.791
If you ask me, I think people
are rather tired of that crazy stuff.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.375
What people is that?

23:30.208 --> 23:34.625
You can't just decry the entire
Modernist movement as worthless.

23:34.708 --> 23:36.291
Samuel's work, perhaps.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.791
Tell me, what does
our resident tastemaker think?

23:47.708 --> 23:50.958
I think the two of you enjoy
your arguments even more than your art.

23:51.958 --> 23:54.416
And… you're both right.

23:56.916 --> 23:59.416
Tradition is important.

24:00.666 --> 24:01.708
It endures.

24:02.791 --> 24:06.958
But what is art
in this modern world without truth?

24:08.083 --> 24:09.125
A little risk?

24:11.583 --> 24:12.541
Who's this?

24:13.041 --> 24:15.125
Uh… Clown!

24:15.833 --> 24:17.041
What's his name?

24:17.875 --> 24:19.375
He doesn't have a name.

24:21.291 --> 24:23.666
I think we need
to give them some names.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.291
I think they deserve that.

24:25.375 --> 24:28.583
-What should we call him?
-I don't know.

24:30.416 --> 24:32.041
And this one, who's this?

24:33.125 --> 24:35.208
He's Mr. Green Mouth.

24:35.833 --> 24:38.375
Mr. Green Mouth?

24:39.041 --> 24:42.458
-Why is he Mr. Green Mouth?
-That's why drew him with a green mouth.

24:42.541 --> 24:44.750
Someone's up awfully late this evening.

24:44.833 --> 24:45.958
Papa!

24:46.041 --> 24:47.750
Hi.

24:48.666 --> 24:51.375
-He wanted to show you his pictures.
-Did he?

24:53.291 --> 24:54.916
I like this.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.958
Very interesting use of color.

24:58.458 --> 25:02.208
Tell you what, I will take all these
to my office so I can see them every day.

25:03.041 --> 25:04.541
-Right?
-All right.

25:04.625 --> 25:05.666
Mm-hmm.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.791
Time for bed. Go brush your teeth.

25:09.458 --> 25:10.916
Papa will tuck you in.

25:11.750 --> 25:12.750
Good boy.

25:31.875 --> 25:32.916
Are you tired?

25:33.458 --> 25:34.625
Exhausted.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.375
How exhausted?

25:50.875 --> 25:51.875
Don't worry.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.333
I'll be quick.

26:15.583 --> 26:16.666
Ow!

26:49.708 --> 26:51.583
Excuse me. Hello?

26:52.583 --> 26:53.416
Hey!

28:25.958 --> 28:26.958
Mm?

29:43.708 --> 29:44.791
-Will?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.416
-Will?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.375
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.333
Nothing, sorry. I was just…

29:58.916 --> 29:59.916
I couldn't sleep.

30:03.833 --> 30:05.333
-You want some tea?
-Sure.

30:06.208 --> 30:07.291
Sure, thank you.

30:15.416 --> 30:19.416
Sweetheart, you didn't meet
whoever sent this, did you?

30:20.708 --> 30:22.541
The man said you know him.

30:23.041 --> 30:26.083
Said his name is Pickman.
He's back in town again.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.000
Mr. Thurber.

30:51.958 --> 30:53.041
You're in early.

30:54.416 --> 30:57.000
This is to be returned to the artist
along with the check.

30:57.666 --> 31:00.583
-I'd like it gone today.
-Of course. Is there an address?

31:00.666 --> 31:01.875
Just get it done!

31:06.458 --> 31:07.583
Please.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.625
Thurber, my boy, you look tired.

31:19.333 --> 31:20.166
My, uh…

31:20.916 --> 31:23.833
My son, he, uh… he isn't sleeping much.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.458
Ah, yes.

31:26.458 --> 31:27.291
Children.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.500
Who are we waiting on?

31:34.625 --> 31:35.500
Apologies.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.833
Yes, yes, let's begin, shall we?
I call the committee to order.

31:39.916 --> 31:43.250
Now, we have a few items
to get through today,

31:43.750 --> 31:48.375
but first, Joe, you look positively
like the cat that ate the canary.

31:48.458 --> 31:50.166
Would you care to enlighten us?

31:52.833 --> 31:55.208
I've invited a special guest to join us.

31:55.291 --> 31:58.458
I'd like the group to consider his work
for this year's exhibition.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.166
Well, now I'm curious.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.666
Gentlemen,

32:03.750 --> 32:06.416
this is Richard Upton Pickman.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.833
Richard and I were at Miskatonic together.

32:10.916 --> 32:13.333
You remember William Thurber, of course.

32:13.416 --> 32:15.291
Ah, of course.

32:17.458 --> 32:20.791
Well,
Richard was a startling talent, even then,

32:20.875 --> 32:24.208
and unlike the rest of us,
only seems to have gotten better with age.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.500
Now, I'm aware it's out of the ordinary,

32:27.583 --> 32:30.083
but I've asked for him
to bring along a few paintings.

32:32.833 --> 32:36.000
If my fellow committee members
will indulge me,

32:36.083 --> 32:39.250
I'll ask for you to head
through to the gallery for a viewing.

32:41.875 --> 32:44.250
I trust you'll find it worth your while.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.625
I suppose we can play along.

32:47.708 --> 32:51.208
-Dr. Reid, I don't think this--
-You'll get your turn.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.125
Joe. Joe!

33:00.916 --> 33:02.166
This is not a good idea.

33:03.208 --> 33:05.500
Aw, are you afraid
of a little competition, Thurber?

33:05.583 --> 33:07.458
I know Pickman. I know his work.

33:07.541 --> 33:09.625
You can't show it at an exhibition.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.250
Huh. Funny.

33:12.333 --> 33:14.541
I never thought of you as a bad sport.

33:15.041 --> 33:18.291
…suffering
from the most terrible…

34:08.041 --> 34:09.041
Will?

34:24.708 --> 34:25.916
Where have you been?

34:28.291 --> 34:30.375
There are some things
I wanna talk to you about,

34:31.250 --> 34:33.583
but I have a monstrous headache, so…

34:33.666 --> 34:34.833
We have a guest.

34:56.583 --> 34:58.958
I hope you don't mind my dropping in.

34:59.833 --> 35:02.500
It's my business…

35:04.500 --> 35:08.000
to catch the undertones of the soul.

35:09.333 --> 35:13.041
You won't find those
on artificial streets,

35:13.125 --> 35:15.458
on man-made lands.

35:17.458 --> 35:19.916
If there are any ghosts round here,

35:21.375 --> 35:27.000
they're the tame ghosts of a salt marsh

35:27.083 --> 35:29.791
and a shallow cove.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.208
My art…

35:37.708 --> 35:38.541
Well…

35:42.250 --> 35:43.958
My art…

35:46.166 --> 35:47.416
…is about the ancient.

35:51.791 --> 35:52.750
Fascinating.

35:55.041 --> 35:58.583
During university,
Will and I and the Miskatonic boys,

35:59.333 --> 36:01.625
we had a little spiritualism phase.

36:03.041 --> 36:04.666
We liked to hold séances.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.291
We liked to call up the dead.

36:11.916 --> 36:17.500
We were just playing games,
but… it was very thrilling.

36:19.541 --> 36:21.333
It felt dangerous.

36:21.416 --> 36:25.083
I truly doubt that Dickie
wants to hear these childish stories.

36:29.875 --> 36:32.500
There was one night when it wasn't a game.

36:37.416 --> 36:38.875
It got very quiet.

36:42.291 --> 36:43.166
And dark.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.458
I…

36:48.375 --> 36:50.916
couldn't see anything anymore.
I felt like…

36:53.458 --> 36:55.625
I felt like I was… like I was blind.

36:57.666 --> 36:58.666
And

36:59.833 --> 37:00.958
the others, I mean…

37:06.250 --> 37:08.666
I never told the others anything, but…

37:11.875 --> 37:12.875
I felt like…

37:14.250 --> 37:16.166
I felt like I was floating.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.166
And then I have this…

37:28.291 --> 37:30.916
this funny feeling in my head.
It's like a…

37:32.750 --> 37:35.291
Sort of a… buzzing?

37:42.791 --> 37:43.625
Yes.

37:46.541 --> 37:47.500
It was a thing.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.833
All those years ago.

37:55.208 --> 37:59.625
Tell me, Richard, you must be
so excited to debut the exhibition.

38:04.583 --> 38:08.416
More than your lovely husband, I fear.

38:09.500 --> 38:13.791
I worry he's grown
more sensitive with age.

38:14.916 --> 38:16.750
Well, that's a word for it.

38:17.875 --> 38:20.708
Well, on that note,
why don't we call it a night?

38:23.791 --> 38:25.541
It's time for James to be put to bed.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.541
Come to my house.

38:35.416 --> 38:36.750
See the work.

38:40.458 --> 38:42.375
Perhaps you should invite Minot.

38:45.166 --> 38:46.916
Minot would never understand!

38:59.375 --> 39:00.791
Just think on it.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.083
Please.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.041
Do thank your wife for dinner.

39:17.041 --> 39:20.125
And tell James I enjoyed our chat.

39:20.208 --> 39:25.166
He's a special boy.
Reminds me a little of myself.

40:01.458 --> 40:02.791
You were rude tonight.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.291
I was embarrassed.

40:06.208 --> 40:07.458
You were embarrassed?

40:08.375 --> 40:10.958
You were fawning over him
like a schoolgirl.

40:13.166 --> 40:16.416
Richard is the only friend of yours
who's succeeded as an artist, and…

40:17.166 --> 40:18.666
the way you treat him…

40:25.500 --> 40:27.000
People are talking, Will.

40:28.583 --> 40:30.541
At the gallery, at the committee.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.875
You are acting strange,
and it's not just with me.

40:34.958 --> 40:36.708
You're coming home late. You…

40:38.333 --> 40:41.750
You're barely home anymore,
and when you are home…

40:45.333 --> 40:47.250
it's like… it's like a…

40:48.166 --> 40:50.791
I feel like…
I feel like you're disappearing from me.

40:54.291 --> 40:56.458
I need to know if you're drinking again.

41:05.583 --> 41:06.416
I…

41:10.958 --> 41:13.500
I have always

41:14.875 --> 41:17.666
tried to look for the… the joy

41:19.166 --> 41:20.958
and the beauty in everything.

41:22.041 --> 41:25.208
But around this man and his work, I just…

41:32.583 --> 41:36.333
The darkness has a way of… catching me.

41:37.916 --> 41:39.958
Life can't always be beautiful.

42:01.125 --> 42:02.500
Ah!

42:02.583 --> 42:03.958
<i>Yog…</i>

42:05.250 --> 42:07.666
No, no… Come…

42:09.333 --> 42:11.125
<i>Ng'ngah.</i>

42:11.583 --> 42:14.541
<i>Yog-sothoth.</i>

42:14.625 --> 42:16.958
<i>Y'ai'ng'ngah.</i>

42:21.000 --> 42:22.041
Ah, ahh!

42:22.125 --> 42:23.416
Ah! No!

42:23.500 --> 42:25.791
Ahh!

42:25.875 --> 42:27.666
Ng-ahh!

42:29.541 --> 42:31.416
-Ah!

42:42.416 --> 42:45.083
-No! No!

42:45.166 --> 42:46.000
No!

42:48.583 --> 42:50.375
Their mouths… Their mouths…

42:50.875 --> 42:52.875
-Sh, sh, sh, sh.

42:53.916 --> 42:55.166
Hey, buddy. You okay?

43:42.666 --> 43:44.666
Will. This is a surprise.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.375
What did you say to my son?

43:49.250 --> 43:50.083
Answer me.

43:51.583 --> 43:52.791
Is he unwell?

43:52.875 --> 43:55.875
He woke screaming in terror.

43:59.500 --> 44:01.166
I'm only gonna say this once.

44:02.333 --> 44:04.791
You stay away from my family.

44:04.875 --> 44:06.500
I thought we were friends.

44:06.583 --> 44:07.750
Friends?

44:07.833 --> 44:11.500
As far as I'm concerned,
the balance of our friendship is paid.

44:13.375 --> 44:15.458
I'm sorry you feel that way,

44:16.458 --> 44:18.291
but it was never about the money.

44:19.958 --> 44:21.833
I value your judgment.

44:21.916 --> 44:23.541
I always have.

44:23.625 --> 44:27.708
Please, Will, you've come all this way.

44:28.250 --> 44:31.041
I know you want to see my new paintings.

44:31.125 --> 44:32.958
The finest I done.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.500
I need you to see 'em.

44:37.666 --> 44:38.500
No.

44:43.000 --> 44:43.875
No, Dickie.

44:50.458 --> 44:54.250
And if… if I was to agree
to stay away from your family?

44:55.250 --> 44:57.583
And also to offer
to pull out of the exhibition,

44:57.666 --> 45:00.375
to destroy my paintings,
should you still think them unsuitable,

45:00.458 --> 45:02.666
and stay out of your life forever?

45:05.375 --> 45:06.541
You would do that?

45:10.583 --> 45:13.458
If you come to my house now.

45:34.791 --> 45:38.666
It must be shocking
to see the state of things here.

45:45.000 --> 45:45.833
But, uh…

45:47.458 --> 45:48.833
my work, Will,

45:49.708 --> 45:51.416
it is paramount.

45:54.625 --> 45:57.041
Electricity went out several months back.

46:02.166 --> 46:03.000
This way.

46:15.875 --> 46:18.125
Welcome to my work.

46:32.166 --> 46:33.583
Do you feel it, Will?

46:36.583 --> 46:37.833
The fear.

46:45.125 --> 46:46.875
Cursed rats.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.666
The hill's infested with them.

46:52.500 --> 46:54.666
<i>Deus</i> knows what they eat.

46:55.291 --> 46:57.166
They must've run short.

47:01.916 --> 47:02.958
One moment.

47:19.541 --> 47:20.458
Back.

47:21.958 --> 47:23.000
Whoa!

47:26.041 --> 47:28.416
No! He's my friend.

47:33.625 --> 47:35.000
No, get down!

47:40.875 --> 47:41.708
Back.

47:55.166 --> 47:56.166
Dickie?

48:39.958 --> 48:42.458
<i>Ng'ngah.</i>

48:42.541 --> 48:45.416
<i>Yog-sothoth.</i>

49:03.708 --> 49:06.250
-Will.
-Somebody has to stop you, Dickie!

49:07.250 --> 49:11.166
If I'm the one, I have to stop you!
Your paintings infect my mind.

49:11.250 --> 49:12.333
It's only art.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.750
No. No!

49:14.458 --> 49:17.083
No, see, see, I thought that it was me.

49:17.166 --> 49:21.166
That I was… I was drunk or… or delirious,

49:22.166 --> 49:26.583
shell-shocked and… and… and broken,
but it was these, these paintings.

49:26.666 --> 49:29.041
This whole time it was the paintings!

49:29.125 --> 49:31.166
What… What you make, it… it…

49:31.250 --> 49:35.208
crawls behind the eyes,
and it… it ma… it makes you crazy.

49:35.291 --> 49:39.583
Dickie, Dickie, it causes madness, and I…

49:39.666 --> 49:42.250
It's the world that's mad, Will.

49:42.916 --> 49:45.250
That's what breeds fear.

49:45.333 --> 49:48.125
Knowing what lurks in the darkness.

49:48.208 --> 49:52.500
-Stop it, stop it, stop it.
-Knowing where fear…

49:52.583 --> 49:54.083
-Stop it, stop it!
-…lives. Here.

49:54.166 --> 49:56.083
-Let me show you.
-Stop it, stop it, stop it.

49:56.166 --> 49:57.750
Make it stop please!

49:59.458 --> 50:00.500
Stop, Dickie!

50:01.000 --> 50:03.291
Dickie, you stop it! What are you doing?!

50:04.958 --> 50:06.333
Dickie, I swear to God!

50:17.750 --> 50:20.625
Paint what you see,

50:21.791 --> 50:24.125
what is familiar to you.

50:26.666 --> 50:28.291
These entities

50:29.375 --> 50:30.500
are real.

50:31.458 --> 50:33.333
Close to me.

50:35.041 --> 50:36.750
Family portraits.

50:38.958 --> 50:41.500
The paintings don't come from my head.

50:47.791 --> 50:49.666
They come from my life.

51:12.083 --> 51:14.833
Now it's time
for you to meet them.

51:20.541 --> 51:23.416
Time to see what awaits us all…

51:25.750 --> 51:27.208
in the darkness.

51:29.541 --> 51:30.375
Dickie.

51:36.958 --> 51:38.375
-Dickie, I'm…

51:57.916 --> 51:59.041
Dear God.

53:12.333 --> 53:14.333
It's all in your mind.

53:21.250 --> 53:22.750
It's extraordinary, Will.

53:23.416 --> 53:26.500
Reid did much of the heavy lifting
before I stepped in.

53:27.458 --> 53:28.875
Go, explore.

53:30.458 --> 53:32.458
I want you to be the first to see it.

53:33.750 --> 53:35.666
-Come on.
-That's my good boy.

53:39.916 --> 53:42.625
You seen Joe?
He was supposed to be here this morning.

53:42.708 --> 53:45.416
Uh, Mr. Minot came in last night,

53:45.500 --> 53:49.291
uh, saying he had
some final adjustments to make.

53:49.375 --> 53:50.791
I think he's still here.

53:52.708 --> 53:53.791
You're sure?

53:54.541 --> 53:55.375
Yes.

54:05.083 --> 54:05.916
Joe?

54:19.708 --> 54:20.541
Joe?

54:25.500 --> 54:28.125
I watched that painting burn, Joe. How d…

<i>Y'ai'ng'ngah</i>.

54:33.958 --> 54:35.041

54:36.833 --> 54:38.333
-Joe.
-<i>Y'ai'ng'ngah…</i>

54:38.416 --> 54:39.250
Joe.

54:40.458 --> 54:41.791
<i>S'ai…</i>

54:42.541 --> 54:43.541
Joe.

54:44.333 --> 54:45.166
It's me.

54:49.041 --> 54:50.500
What have you done, Joe?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.458
He is coming from the other side.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.750
It's okay. It's okay. I'm g… I'm gonna…

54:55.833 --> 54:57.666
He is coming for the feast.

54:58.375 --> 55:02.083
He is coming from the darkness
to show us all the beauty…

55:02.166 --> 55:03.625
-Gabriel!
-…of fear!

55:03.708 --> 55:04.666
Gabriel!

55:15.458 --> 55:18.416
Hey, you all right?
Why don't you go see Gabriel?

55:20.625 --> 55:22.166
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

55:22.250 --> 55:24.750
-You sure?
-Of course I'm fine. What…

55:24.833 --> 55:27.000
There's been an accident. It's… It's Joe.

55:27.083 --> 55:29.583
-An accident?
-I need you to take James home right now.

55:29.666 --> 55:31.291
-What kind of--
-Now, Rebecca.

55:37.666 --> 55:38.958
-Joe's hurt.
-What?

55:40.291 --> 55:41.416
I'm gonna go get him help.

55:41.500 --> 55:44.791
I want you to take
all of Pickman's works out immediately.

55:44.875 --> 55:45.958
Do you understand?

55:46.833 --> 55:50.750
-Take them? Where? What's happening?
-Just get them out of here. Destroy them.

55:53.791 --> 55:56.083
And, Gabriel…

56:01.125 --> 56:02.666
Do not look at them.

56:08.083 --> 56:09.291
You burn them!

56:09.791 --> 56:11.333
Joe, look away!

57:09.708 --> 57:11.208
It smells delicious.

57:16.083 --> 57:16.958
I, uh…

57:19.541 --> 57:22.416
I want to apologize to you, my love,

57:24.625 --> 57:25.833
for how I've been.

57:28.916 --> 57:31.416
I want you to know
that it's… it's all over now.

57:36.125 --> 57:37.500
Everything is gonna be…

57:38.250 --> 57:39.666
it's gonna be better. I'm…

57:41.375 --> 57:42.458
I'm going to be better.

57:44.083 --> 57:45.000
I promise you.

57:48.041 --> 57:48.875
It's all over.

57:52.208 --> 57:53.333
It's… It's over.

57:55.166 --> 57:56.875
I know where it lives, Will.

57:58.916 --> 57:59.750
What?

58:00.250 --> 58:01.958
Where what lives, sweetheart?

58:02.041 --> 58:03.416
I know where fear lives.

58:15.333 --> 58:16.708
No. No.

58:18.750 --> 58:20.500
Please, please, please, God!

58:20.583 --> 58:22.166
No, no, not…

58:22.250 --> 58:23.291
Not you!

58:23.375 --> 58:25.041
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

58:25.125 --> 58:27.416
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please.

58:28.458 --> 58:31.208
Please. I… I… I tried. I did try.

58:31.791 --> 58:33.250
Sh.

58:37.041 --> 58:38.416
You'll spoil the meal.

58:55.333 --> 58:56.625
Where is James?

58:57.458 --> 58:58.291
Rebecca.

59:02.291 --> 59:05.083
Where's… Where's James?
Where… Where is our son?

59:05.750 --> 59:07.166
Where's our son?!

59:10.291 --> 59:12.000
Soon we will feast.

59:13.666 --> 59:15.333
And it will be glorious, my love.

59:22.041 --> 59:23.000
You'll see.
