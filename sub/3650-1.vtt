01:22.450 --> 01:24.118
I could not reach you!
Where were you?

01:24.218 --> 01:25.418
What happened, Mom?

01:25.453 --> 01:26.754
Your father ...

01:26.854 --> 01:28.922
The doctor thinks he has a stroke

01:30.506 --> 01:33.417
Well, obviously. We're going to find out.
Come on.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.211
I'm gonna get us coffee.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.872
We have a cat scan
and requested an MRI.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.308
And what we see so far,
based on his current situation,

01:47.408 --> 01:49.343
and in the reporting of his last visit

01:49.443 --> 01:50.978
we just want to rule out some things.

01:51.078 --> 01:53.347
We have a better image
if the tests are initiated.

01:53.447 --> 01:57.616
We'll keep you all informed.
- Thank you, Dr. Fenton.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.254
Can we see him please?

02:00.354 --> 02:02.757
Of course.
Follow me.

02:02.857 --> 02:04.089
Come on.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.893
Mr. Dadon?
- Yes?

02:08.458 --> 02:10.826
Go ahead. I'll be right there.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.902
I'm sorry, but how are you insured?

02:18.004 --> 02:20.141
No insurance.

02:22.543 --> 02:23.978

02:26.394 --> 02:29.183
Do me a favor and say nothing
accounts and money.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.819
All of it. You do ..
You'll find me, okay?

02:31.919 --> 02:33.287
Sir, I know it
difficult times ...

02:33.387 --> 02:35.796
You understand what I'm saying, right?

02:36.659 --> 02:38.128
Obviously.

02:38.229 --> 02:40.564
I go to him. So come
back and we'll talk, okay?

02:40.665 --> 02:42.190
Okay. Thanks.

02:50.553 --> 02:52.400
Someone called from a pickup.

02:53.916 --> 02:56.986
Now, okay.

02:57.101 --> 02:58.716
Did you write the address?

03:04.714 --> 03:06.420
And, baby ..

03:07.406 --> 03:08.651
Yes?

03:09.789 --> 03:12.690
I know it's not your responsibility.

03:17.187 --> 03:19.285
Yes, give them table 12.

03:20.167 --> 03:24.271
Do not worry about that.
Say Jerome girls have already come.

03:24.371 --> 03:29.308
Yes, I said it. 5,000 minimal.
He is 20 and Jerome is working on it.

03:30.056 --> 03:32.746
He's what?
He's not there?

03:32.846 --> 03:35.422
Okay, clearly,
I'm on my way.

03:47.335 --> 03:48.635
Thanks.

03:49.662 --> 03:50.942
Excuse me.

03:51.181 --> 03:52.482
What is this place?

03:52.684 --> 03:54.987
My club Venue.
It is the most popular club in the city.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.747
Come along if you want.
Say that you know me.

03:57.989 --> 03:59.189

Calm down dear, do not worry.
Eventually, we'll get in.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.026
But the line does not move.

06:32.126 --> 06:35.629
I know, but I think
they wait until people leave.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.798
Good. Wait here, okay?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.434
Where are you going?
Moment.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.469
Excuse me.
Hi. Listen.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.838
I do not want ...
I do not want to go out,

06:44.938 --> 06:47.675
but I need to be inside.
Friends with the owner.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.443
I'm here with my girl
and her friends.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.079
We just want to have some fun.
Their feet hurt man, literally.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.815
What's the problem?
- Nothing.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.784
Wants to see the owner?
- Yes, he's here for him.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.950
You know the owner?
- Yes.

07:00.050 --> 07:00.451
What does he look like?

07:00.551 --> 07:04.692
Same height as me, has a beard,
looks like Pacino in Serpico.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.960
That guy, the egg ...
Okay. Yes we ...

07:07.060 --> 07:10.664
Anton! Anton Get Al Pacino.
- Yes Boss.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.399
Thanks.
He'll straighten everything.

07:12.499 --> 07:16.337
Here comes the owner grid.
Here he is. This is ...

07:16.437 --> 07:18.706
a friend of yours.
- I could always come, remember?

07:18.806 --> 07:20.174
Yes Yes.
Who are you with?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.843
My girlfriend and some friends of hers.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.811
Good. Joe, let him inside.
- Honey!

07:45.365 --> 07:47.434
Mark! Mark!
What the hell is going on?

07:47.534 --> 07:50.104
Looks best in show there.
Where are the girls?

07:50.204 --> 07:53.040
You can find better in girls
sector 21, near the cash register, Mark.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.042
I know.
- Where is Jerome?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.878
Food poisoning, probably.
- Poisoning, my ass!

07:57.978 --> 08:01.215
Tell that stupid dick, that if he
next appears in the club,

08:01.315 --> 08:03.217
I put an end to that
gay modeling career.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.552
I put his foot in his ass.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.821
Good promoters are difficult
to find, you know that.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.324
He had one stupid mission.
An assignment!

08:10.424 --> 08:13.794
Bring pretty girls to the club.
Where are they?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.430
Look. Look at Mr. Hyman there, okay?

08:16.530 --> 08:21.101
50,000 waiting.
Besides who is he? Besides which, Mark?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.568
Arrange it.
Adjust this fucking problem now!

08:36.616 --> 08:37.817
I see you.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.091
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.194
Thank you to bring me in.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.563
You bouncer's an asshole.
He thought I made sense-clearances.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.298
Yes, everyone says that.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.367
I take him. How does someone
if you so many pretty girls?

08:53.467 --> 08:54.935
How do you mean?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.737
Given my experience,
unless you have 10 million or a big cock.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.838
Do you understand what I mean?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.773
Well ..
- Does he have?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.876
My girlfriend. We celebrate their success

09:02.976 --> 09:06.576
And this is just like friends and friends

09:06.647 --> 09:08.649
Wait, who's your girlfriend?
- She here.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.750
Hi.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.655
Nice to meet you.
- You too.

09:11.706 --> 09:15.872
Do you want to V.I.P room?
Free drinks all night.

09:16.883 --> 09:20.185
What do you think about it?
Okay. Come on.

09:20.512 --> 09:23.505
Here's my phone number. Call me
if you want something.

09:23.556 --> 09:27.447
Okay no problem. Follow me.
Come on, people.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.871
Mr. Hyman, how are you?
This is Johnny. Johnny, this is Mr. Hyman.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.842
How are you?
Thank you to receive us here.

09:58.955 --> 10:02.762
I have no idea how you did that.
Good salvation, Mark.

10:03.004 --> 10:03.971
Thank you.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.106
Okay, who is this guy?
- He's a limousine driver.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.541
Remember the guy who ever came?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.543
Remember when you stopped him?
Said I to Al Pacino corpse?

10:09.643 --> 10:13.814
Yes, yes, the owner.
Once this is all yours.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.516
You keep saying it.
- I love you.

10:15.623 --> 10:18.634
You get something extra tomorrow.
- Thank you, Bobby.

10:52.949 --> 10:54.852
Come here!

10:55.086 --> 10:57.709
You fell asleep on me, you know?

11:03.953 --> 11:07.558
What? What is it?
- My God, I've got a hangover.

11:07.612 --> 11:08.981
Me too.

11:10.404 --> 11:13.672
Is everything alright?
- Yes, I have promised to make breakfast.

11:15.595 --> 11:17.096
I'll meet you downstairs?

11:19.317 --> 11:20.517
Really?

11:20.608 --> 11:23.411
I'm hungry.
- Yeah, me too .... in something else.

11:23.541 --> 11:25.076
Stop.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.120
I'm so down.
- Okay.

11:27.171 --> 11:29.438
I'm going to get dressed.

11:30.351 --> 11:31.596
Do not do that.

11:39.412 --> 11:41.115
Do you need help?

11:41.535 --> 11:44.626
"Need help"?
Yes, I need help.

11:44.726 --> 11:46.504
Look what I found in his pajama jacket.

11:47.104 --> 11:48.504
Can you believe this?

11:53.079 --> 11:54.512
Good.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.614
Stupid thing.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.953
Okay, come on.
- Yeah, come on

12:06.796 --> 12:09.265
I got him.
Come on.

12:12.394 --> 12:13.594
Hi.

12:15.675 --> 12:17.811
Doctor, he is conscious?

12:17.957 --> 12:20.760
Yeah, still is.

12:21.090 --> 12:25.895
Look, I do not know how long
he remains unconscious.

12:25.946 --> 12:29.280
I very much appreciate that you
there are, but would not stay too long,

12:29.316 --> 12:31.385
because he has his full energy needs.

12:31.485 --> 12:34.354
Can he hear me?
- Yes, he can hear you.

12:34.405 --> 12:38.374
As I said, not too long.
- Okay. Thank You.

12:39.774 --> 12:41.207
David.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.117
David.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.507
'Dadon limos, my favorite
limousine company.

12:53.607 --> 12:56.266
Just stay down, stay down.

13:01.847 --> 13:06.062
Where are you from "limo driver"?
- Brooklyn.

13:06.753 --> 13:10.090
I am a tourist? Where in Brooklyn?
- "Midwood."

13:10.190 --> 13:14.659
Are always specific, Johnny.
God is the details, remember.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.031
Like my nice suit?
- What?

13:18.131 --> 13:21.141
My suit. I asked you something.
Like what?

13:21.935 --> 13:25.972
Yes, nice. Such a beautiful thing, see
you are not in this environment.

13:26.072 --> 13:30.577
You have to pretend it's real
Have you ever heard of that?

13:30.677 --> 13:33.613
You should do at all times or you
have power, even though you do not have it,

13:33.713 --> 13:36.450
because by the time that they
through have been too late.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.684
Fuck, I have power.
What do you want to do next?

13:39.685 --> 13:41.553
Stop here on the right.

13:45.756 --> 13:47.644
Johnny, you've been here ever?

13:48.577 --> 13:50.863
No. You want me to wait?

13:50.931 --> 13:54.601
No, I really want you to come,
I want you to meet someone.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.502
Wait what?
Guest? What guy?

13:59.454 --> 14:00.756
Good evening, gentlemen.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.642
Can I record something for you,
the kitchen about to close.

14:02.742 --> 14:06.847
Yes, we would like to order something.
Johnny, are you a vegetarian?

14:06.947 --> 14:09.084
What?
- Whether you're a vegetarian?

14:09.184 --> 14:12.119
Do you cry at Thanksgiving?
- No.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.820
Two fillets, please.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.289
How should it be cooked?
- Well done for me.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.326
No. He does not get it
well done, this is not Denny's.

14:19.377 --> 14:21.479
Food must be in the correct manner
be prepared, right?

14:21.628 --> 14:25.332
I would say medium.
- Two fillets medium.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.534
Okay.
- Thank You.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.902
I like my steak well prepared.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.714
You do not get steak but filet mignon.

14:33.059 --> 14:35.963
Johnny, I want you to come work for me.

14:36.376 --> 14:40.947
Okay, you do not fall in, but what do you do?
Do you work for the man with the hat?

14:40.998 --> 14:43.367
Bobby, yes.
I promote parties.

14:43.467 --> 14:47.171
As an event planner?
- Do I look like a planner?

14:47.222 --> 14:49.958
Okay, you're selling parties.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.859
I sell relevance.

14:52.076 --> 14:54.678
Ask yourself why the
people standing in line at a nightclub,

14:54.794 --> 14:57.197
in the freezing cold?
Do you know why?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.966
They have to dance.
- They must be seen.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.026
You know the old saying,
"If a tree falls in the forest,"

15:03.077 --> 15:04.887
and no one is there to
To hear him fall,

15:04.938 --> 15:08.721
Did it make a sound? "
And that goes for New York.

15:08.772 --> 15:10.440
If you go to a nightclub,

15:10.491 --> 15:13.561
and nobody knows you
are there, you exist then?

15:13.980 --> 15:16.948
And people are ready for it
to pay and find out.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.395
I have ...
I have everyone in my pocket.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.956
I have the people with money,
famous people, everyone.

15:23.056 --> 15:26.724
Really. But I can best
someone like you use.

15:27.742 --> 15:30.279
Okay, where is this all about?

15:30.349 --> 15:33.719
Girls, Johnny,
It's all about girls.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.704
It is legal. It's everywhere.

15:37.804 --> 15:41.241
How bloter better.
Actually, models.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.386
Have you ever seen a table
bought in a nightclub?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.512
No, I do not have the money for?

15:45.563 --> 15:47.644
Not yet, but they will.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.274
Bottles for models?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.699
Sounds weird, right?
And I have a little bit of everything.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.737
Where do I start?

15:54.788 --> 15:57.958
You're good with girls that looked
I that night you were there.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.170
They trust you, and believe it or
but that's not hard to find

16:01.227 --> 16:04.064
So you want me to go to models
look at the club? That will work.

16:04.164 --> 16:07.734
No, nice try.
I want you to come with girls.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.736
You start with the ones you already know.

16:09.787 --> 16:13.691
Then you come with any models.
I'll help you.

16:13.742 --> 16:17.644
This is an issue of a
Models apartment.

16:19.949 --> 16:22.031
There's no name, to
Who should I ask?

16:22.082 --> 16:25.752
How do I know? I've got it
from someone who was drunk.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.456
Listen, I have tomorrow
a dinner arranged here.

16:29.507 --> 16:30.842
And then we go to the district.

16:30.893 --> 16:34.027
If you bring me 6 girls,
I'll give you $ 1,500 cash.

16:35.212 --> 16:37.582
That's it?
Only beautiful girls?

16:37.877 --> 16:39.345
Sounds easy, right?

16:39.532 --> 16:41.835
Do not come with your girlfriend.
- Why?

16:41.935 --> 16:45.739
Because you have a way
worn where it is not so happy.

16:45.839 --> 16:48.208
I mean, it's just business.
What are you going to do?

16:48.308 --> 16:51.940
This is more like a nightclub or
work I try to give you.

16:51.991 --> 16:53.960
This is a culture flow.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.549
<I> The richest people in the world, </ i>

16:56.649 --> 17:00.186
<I> dancing to a local guest
they have never met. </ i>

17:00.286 --> 17:05.392
<I> And who sings about the local guest
things he sees in the club. </ i>

17:05.492 --> 17:08.762
<I> You know Jay Z? If he says, "six
models, six bottles of Christ "? </ i>

17:08.862 --> 17:10.297
Where do you think he sees?

17:10.396 --> 17:11.998
My club.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.669
Johnny, this is bigger than you and me.
Bigger than all those people.

17:15.769 --> 17:18.838
They will be made much money.
These are the real issues.

17:18.938 --> 17:22.075
If you do it right
We go straight to the top.

17:22.175 --> 17:24.844
As Tony Montana said.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.979
Trust me, think about it.

17:45.966 --> 17:47.332
Shit.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.541
How many miles are on it?

17:54.592 --> 17:56.148
I can not remember.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.145
Do you look for a moment, I have to take this.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.449
<I> How are you?
- Do you regularly girls </ i>?

18:02.500 --> 18:06.602
I'm working on it.
- Johnny, 1,500 dollars. Come on.

18:08.256 --> 18:10.493
Hey, I'll give you $ 3,000.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.236
How many?

18:12.297 --> 18:13.598
- Yes.

18:13.846 --> 18:15.815
Get out of here. Do not waste my time.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.740
No, wait.
How much you want for it?

18:17.797 --> 18:20.800
You know that things are on wheels, right?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.469
It is a business.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.338
Yes. But I ...
I need something to drive, you know?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.773
5,000 dollars?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.524
Give me $ 5,000 and you
may look again.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.876
Fuck ... no, man.
You're wasting ...

18:29.976 --> 18:31.937
You are not serious. As
you can call to me.

18:31.988 --> 18:34.391
Because you looks serious.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.747
Get lost.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.478
<I> Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, can you come here </ i>?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.267
I do not think you want tonight.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.817
Your mother and sister are with your father.
- Look ...

19:10.917 --> 19:13.686
I try some things out to
look, can you help me?

19:13.786 --> 19:17.037
And you think the club
as the right place for it?

19:17.088 --> 19:19.188
Tanya, can you help me?

19:21.477 --> 19:22.709
Okay.

19:23.419 --> 19:25.451
I tend some calls.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.681
Johnny! How are you?
- Everything okay?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.694
Only you two?
- Yes.

19:54.794 --> 19:58.598
My people are over 20
minutes so need to plan B.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.935
Hey baby, nice to see you.
What was your name again?

20:02.035 --> 20:04.270
Tanya.
- You look beautiful.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.304
Johnny, your girlfriend looks beautiful.
You understand that, right?

20:07.373 --> 20:10.176
True, I am a perfectionist.
- Is ridiculous.

20:10.276 --> 20:12.979
Welcome, sit down and
Give me your coat.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.782
These are my friends Tanya and Johnny.
- Sam.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.917
How was the ride?
- Good.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.787
Do you want something to drink?
- No, thank you.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.222
Come on, take something.
- No.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.523
Do you want to drink something?
- Yes.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.315
OK nice.

20:25.837 --> 20:27.704
Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:30.263 --> 20:34.031
What was with those girls, mark.
You have said nothing about strippers.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.205
I had to go to plan B, what would you have done?
- Plan B.

20:39.305 --> 20:43.521
This is Plan B? It's getting a bit
strange now, what should I tell Tanya?

20:43.584 --> 20:45.193
Tell her to stop with a bitch.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.247
Hey ...
- I'm just a joke.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.915
Hey, Marky-Mark.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.650
How are you?
- How is my jungle girl?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.085
I'm alright.
- Yes?

20:52.185 --> 20:53.753
Yes.
- Okay.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.083
He is the best promoter in the city,
if you fall bothering him lose.

20:57.150 --> 20:58.874
You know Johnny D yet?

20:58.925 --> 21:01.194
He was the driver who helped us
hyman with gold, remember?

21:01.294 --> 21:03.163
When he bought all those bottles?
- Johnny D!

21:03.263 --> 21:07.100
Johnny, you stay with
him and make dreams come true.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.623
Thank you, Bobby.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.740
Johnny D?
- How about tonight?

21:13.840 --> 21:17.810
I invited her friends and if they
do not come, I can not send her away.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.914
Johnny, listen to me. If you do this
work can not now tell me.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.316
I waste no further time, place
that soft side of you aside.

21:23.416 --> 21:27.654
Mark, hey.
- Shit, Jerome.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.989
Do yourself a favor
and do not do it here.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.424
Back. Go back!
- Hey.

21:31.524 --> 21:33.359
Jerome.
- Mark, what's going on?

21:33.459 --> 21:36.462
You let me out of here
stand as one or other rat.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.031
Jerome, do me a favor and go.

21:38.131 --> 21:41.367
Fuck you, Mark. I make
always the party for you.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.170
I try to
protect, believe me. Go!

21:44.270 --> 21:47.207
Jerome!
- Bobby, he's just leave.

21:47.307 --> 21:52.011
Calm down, what's the matter?
Jerome! Jerome!

21:52.111 --> 21:54.280
Bobby?
- Jerome, he's a good kid.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.950
Mark, what are you doing?
Are you all right?

21:57.050 --> 21:58.585

21:58.685 --> 22:01.254
How is modeling?

22:01.354 --> 22:04.123
Is it good on the catwalk?
I love this guy.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.725
Shit.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
Take the guy away and leave
him taste the shoe leather.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.729
Bobby, Bobby, go inside.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.965
I do not see him here.
- He's not coming back.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.132
I'd never see him again.

22:13.232 --> 22:14.877
Do me a favor and go inside.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.303
What is this?
- I do not see him here.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.739
Listen to me.
Johnny, go home.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.208
Take your girlfriend and go home.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.042
I'll call you Thursday
there is still someone.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.445
I'm sorry net.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.480
There she is!

22:27.580 --> 22:30.016
Johnny, I'll call you!

22:30.116 --> 22:32.917
Damn, that girl is pretty.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.224
You let me in only
stand, make a joke?

22:38.324 --> 22:39.826
Want to work in clubs?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.861
Those girls were so disgusting, Johnny.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.564
I know, sorry.
I did not expect that.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.232
But Mark's a good guest.

22:46.332 --> 22:49.135
Good people do not sit
with whores and criminals.

22:49.235 --> 22:50.536
And with whom you surrounded ...

22:50.636 --> 22:52.839
I do not want a sermon, Tanya.
Not really.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.240
You do not know under what pressure I stand.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.476
I'm just saying you better
are than Johnny.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.488
I'm just trying to make some money.

23:01.012 --> 23:02.301
Wait ...

23:02.714 --> 23:05.018
Take it easy.

23:05.118 --> 23:08.318
If you continue with that Mark

30:38.137 --> 30:41.974

30:42.074 --> 30:44.276
You're going to be mad. $ 3,000.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.846
You'll get compliments from our
Saudi friend who will find you great.

30:46.946 --> 30:50.546
Is this just for tonight?
This is only the beginning, believe me.

30:50.815 --> 30:52.384
I think I understand it all.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.354
You think you understand it.
You understand everything.

30:55.454 --> 30:58.689

Well done Johnny.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.992
Some sleep.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.600
Did you see that girl?

31:07.700 --> 31:09.902
She was beautiful, right?
She was just perfect.

31:10.002 --> 31:15.841
<I> Johnny, listen. modeling, pick
Girls from all over the world. </ i>

31:15.941 --> 31:20.980
They are small
put apartments without money

31:21.080 --> 31:25.551
The only problem is., If they have their
do not work well lie them out.

31:25.651 --> 31:28.053
Therefore, they need guys like us so.

31:28.153 --> 31:32.525
To take them out for free food
Free entry to clubs, plus drink.

31:32.625 --> 31:36.662
The only thing we must do is ensure that
our bouncer not let anyone inside,

31:36.762 --> 31:40.332
<I> keep his eyes open for our
models, VIPs and famous people. </ i>

31:40.432 --> 31:43.135
We have people that their
brings to the table,

31:43.235 --> 31:47.506
but we must always ensure that
The bar is stocked for energy.

31:47.606 --> 31:51.710
Then we hire a DJ and
take care of our customers.

31:51.810 --> 31:55.381
The guests who do 1,000, 2,000 dollars.
But, Johnny,

32:12.665 --> 32:14.133
<I> Are you listening to me? </ I>

32:14.233 --> 32:16.402
People, We have a large
night tonight, okay?

32:16.502 --> 32:18.904
I want to clean tables,
and you do not leave the table.

32:19.004 --> 32:20.782
You do everything for that table.
You look ...

32:26.679 --> 32:29.682
Meet the next 10 years
Every evening a beautiful girl,

32:29.782 --> 32:34.186
and blow you all
off your shoes.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.554
All you have to do is control yourself.

32:42.861 --> 32:46.298
You want them to come to a party. As
you have sex the first night, it's over.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.700
She's not coming.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.635
You let her feel that they want you.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.047
You keep removing its me again and again.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.572
And finally grab your hair,

32:53.672 --> 32:55.973
because she goes back to Nebraska
or where she came from.

32:55.974 --> 33:00.077
And then never again?
- They may come after the summer.

33:47.892 --> 33:49.270
People.

33:49.684 --> 33:50.887
What is it?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.929
Where have you been, Johnny?

33:56.041 --> 33:58.111
Listen.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.805
I thought how I you
tell this was so,

34:02.750 --> 34:04.953
I give parties in town.

34:05.004 --> 34:06.740
Festivities?
Is this a joke?

34:06.842 --> 34:11.146
It's nothing bad, right?
It's like a job and pays well ...

34:11.268 --> 34:15.638
Well, not for another family disappear.

34:17.288 --> 34:20.726
Look, ma,
you have no idea what I'm trying to do.

34:20.777 --> 34:24.313
Indeed, I have no idea!
What do you think now?

34:24.463 --> 34:26.899
If you're doing something illegal should
you tell me that now.

34:26.998 --> 34:30.101
Everything I do is for you two, right?

34:30.251 --> 34:33.987
I do what I can ... What do you want from me, ma?

34:34.039 --> 34:36.809
All I am trying to say
is that your father did not want ...

34:36.909 --> 34:38.978
I am doing something he does not understand?

34:39.078 --> 34:40.980
Pa did not understand many things, okay?

34:41.031 --> 34:43.699
Dad never took a chance in his
life and what has it brought him?

34:43.751 --> 34:46.717
Lying in a hospital bed.

34:47.174 --> 34:48.943
That has brought him.

34:49.190 --> 34:52.027
Who are you to talk like that about your father?

34:52.190 --> 34:54.693
Who do you think the
pay bills here, ma?

34:54.744 --> 34:57.447
Who do you think the phone,
electricity,

34:57.498 --> 34:59.600
car insurance and all
others pay bills?

34:59.698 --> 35:02.143
Watch your words,
You do not talk to me.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.303
You're not sure how things
rule? Sorry but it breaks my heart,

35:05.304 --> 35:08.207
But someone has to ensure that there
pays word and you know why?

35:08.307 --> 35:11.744
Because you do not have a pension when people
30 years riding around in a limo.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.111
You will have no health insurance
or medical things.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.248
You have not.
- Johnny, what's wrong with you?

35:16.348 --> 35:18.948
Why, what's wrong with me?
- What is wrong with you?

35:18.999 --> 35:21.301
Tell me.
- Let it go.

35:21.469 --> 35:25.707
It goes well with me.
But I'm gone, sorry.

35:26.058 --> 35:28.752
Come back.
Come back!

35:33.026 --> 35:34.895
What do you think?

35:35.386 --> 35:39.755
Beautiful ..
- Thank You.

35:40.286 --> 35:42.255
Johnny D in person.

35:42.565 --> 35:46.836
With all the things that have to play there
I say you do have guts.

35:46.887 --> 35:49.123
Yes, I want to apologize for

35:49.174 --> 35:50.542
I feel bad.
- Come on.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.152
You do not have to apologize,
I loved it.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.521
Come on, I'm not crazy,
I know what you did.

35:55.572 --> 35:58.583
How do you think I got Stephanie?
I've been told that I was a photographer.

35:58.634 --> 35:59.968
What's wrong with actor?

36:00.052 --> 36:02.789
Not so good the first time.
Do you understand what I mean?

36:02.895 --> 36:05.431
And I've tried it, but ...

36:05.531 --> 36:08.600
I always ended up to
bringing home the drunken girls

36:08.700 --> 36:09.735
which challenged me.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.537
That is beautiful.

36:11.588 --> 36:14.758
I leave and go some girls
meet, you coming?

36:14.907 --> 36:17.528
Yes, where?
- Friend, it's fashion week.

36:17.579 --> 36:20.182
Do not say you've never been there.
- I've never been there.

36:20.371 --> 36:23.205
You're going to like this.
- Okay.

36:50.042 --> 36:54.746
What do you think? Dance a little
and eat with the girls here?

36:54.846 --> 36:56.180
That sounds good.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.150
Not bad?
- Not bad.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.539
Honey, almost ready?
- Yeah, give me 10 minutes?

37:01.553 --> 37:04.523
Are you hungry?
- We are starving.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.891
Nevertheless, girls?
- Yes.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.794
Everyone is invited at my expense.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.894
Beautiful.
- Perfect.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.365
Steven!
- How are you?

37:16.734 --> 37:18.201
I want you to meet someone.

37:18.270 --> 37:21.338
This is Johnny D. Johnny D, Sebastian.
Sebastian, Johnny D.

37:21.839 --> 37:24.042
Good to meet you.

37:24.142 --> 37:27.613
So you're the prodigy
where Mark is talking about.

37:28.951 --> 37:32.153
I have an after after party
in my suit tomorrow.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.320
Tomorrow I'm going to drink wine,

37:35.420 --> 37:38.724
and beautiful girls stalking
in the streets of Paris.

37:38.824 --> 37:42.761
Because it's fashion week in Paris.
I really have no choice.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.731
I should have known. You
should really come, Johnny.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.100
It's true, you should go.

37:48.151 --> 37:49.351
Sounds good.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.638
Okay.
- We'll see you later, OK

37:52.738 --> 37:53.938
Yes.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.027
Sorry, I did not want to be rude
but have a lot on my mind.

38:17.691 --> 38:20.726
No excuses. It is beautiful.

38:21.712 --> 38:22.914
What is beautiful?

38:23.335 --> 38:27.380
It's nice once someone
To see something that feels.

38:33.625 --> 38:34.961
No, I take that.

38:35.012 --> 38:36.546
No, Johnny, which do
to not do that.

38:36.597 --> 38:38.132
No, come on.
- That's ridiculous.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.383
I pay.

38:39.434 --> 38:41.835
Let him do it.

38:44.389 --> 38:47.593
Thank you, Johnny.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.225
Do you know?

38:54.298 --> 38:56.400
This way, girls.

38:56.477 --> 38:59.278
I'm coming, I gotta take this.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.141
You really going home?

39:03.241 --> 39:04.943
I have early tomorrow.

39:05.434 --> 39:07.768
So let's not there yet.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.853
Michelle, come on.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.356
Another time?
- Let's do just that.

39:17.456 --> 39:18.656
Yes.

39:19.590 --> 39:20.924
Come on.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.896
Johnny!
- Yes.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.065
Come on.

39:27.165 --> 39:30.557
Do you drink water, she drinks tequila.
Always works, believe me.

39:34.438 --> 39:38.777
Ellen, Ellen, this is Johnny.
- How are you?

39:38.828 --> 39:40.396
I would like to overflow a few things.

39:40.447 --> 39:43.760
Please, because I come here
a very big day, right?

39:43.811 --> 39:45.380
First,

39:45.725 --> 39:47.393
let the bottles on the table.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.956
What we drink, just leave it alone.
Nothing clearing.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.291
Okay.

39:52.391 --> 39:55.160
Second, some come every 15 to
20 minutes along the table and say,

39:55.260 --> 39:58.397
"Hey, Johnny, there is an important
call for you. "

39:58.497 --> 40:00.213
But do it about
every 15 to 20 minutes.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.533
I will send you away,
but keep coming back.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.470
Thirdly,
if I do this ...

40:05.521 --> 40:07.390
you bring us two glasses of tequila.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.041
If I do this ...
one finger,

40:09.148 --> 40:12.785
apply one glass of Tequila for her
and one glass of water for me.

40:12.878 --> 40:15.781
I know it seems strange,
just follow me, you know?

40:15.918 --> 40:18.020
- Okay.
- Here, this is for you.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.786
- That I manage it I think.
- Marky, the devil.

40:20.837 --> 40:24.469
- So, I'll see you in a few hours.
- I'll see you tonight.

40:29.794 --> 40:33.231
Thank you.
Let us do this first.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.531
You're crazy!

40:34.533 --> 40:35.528
- Ready?
- Cheers.

40:35.579 --> 40:39.624
Look in the eyes.
Here we go.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.709
- Johnny?
- Yes?

40:43.809 --> 40:45.344
There is a call for you.

40:45.444 --> 40:49.081
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm actually ...

40:49.181 --> 40:51.740
with a friend where I
impress me choose.

40:51.813 --> 40:55.115
So, no phones tonight.
No business. Okay.

40:56.266 --> 40:57.953
Someone calls you here?

40:58.117 --> 41:01.160
Sometimes they try to call me here
when my phone is off and ...

41:01.211 --> 41:03.362
That's strange!

41:03.462 --> 41:06.131
- Are you sure it's not important?
- No, this is important.

41:06.231 --> 41:09.734
This is important.
No business tonight.

41:09.785 --> 41:11.119
Okay, you know what?
I'm going to ...

41:11.169 --> 41:13.572
I'm going to the toilet, very fast.
When I come back,

41:13.672 --> 41:15.707
a real conversation, right?
- All right, we do.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.407
Well, get ready.

41:21.245 --> 41:24.414
What is your fucking problem?
It's only a girl.

41:31.559 --> 41:33.645
No towels.
Super.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.673
I do not know ...
Is this a lot?

41:53.477 --> 41:56.014
Sorry about that,
sorry about that.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.150
Okay. Ready
for a real conversation? Okay.

41:58.201 --> 41:59.502
Ready.

41:59.553 --> 42:03.805
I never, never in my life
about you masturbated in the catalog.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.357
Okay, are you ready for the question?

42:05.457 --> 42:06.792
This can be a bit offensive,
I know.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.093
We do not know each other really well, but ...

42:08.193 --> 42:10.061
This sounds good.
Start!

42:10.161 --> 42:16.161
Why let you guys ...
in this environment ... you use?

42:16.270 --> 42:18.603
Let us take a minute appointment.

42:19.394 --> 42:21.697
We get free dinners.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.775
Free drinks all night.

42:23.875 --> 42:28.780
Direct access to the best
places around the world, right?

42:28.880 --> 42:33.385
We can hang out with the most
interesting, funny, dynamic people

42:33.485 --> 42:35.821
where we throughout our lives
looked upon it.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.989
I am treated like a princess.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.682
Who is using whom?

42:40.858 --> 42:43.161
- Are not you agree?
- Yes.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.730
Johnny,
they keep calling you.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.500
- No, no, no. Tell them ...
- They urge real.

42:48.600 --> 42:52.571
No damn phones. Jesus!
God! Enough with you!

42:52.671 --> 42:54.039
Let us not hesitate.

42:54.139 --> 42:58.341
Would you still want me to play along,
which is more than 300.

42:59.843 --> 43:03.014
And baby,
as you know,

43:03.114 --> 43:06.401
he pours your full Tequila
while he drinks water.

43:07.411 --> 43:08.611
That's a lot of bullshit.

43:08.662 --> 43:10.397
- Wow. Really?
- Smell it.

43:10.755 --> 43:15.093
- You're a real bastard, right?
- No, Michelle, I'm not.

43:15.193 --> 43:17.796
Come on, Michelle, stop.
I'm not a bastard, right?

43:17.896 --> 43:20.131
- I'm a little nervous ...
- Honey ...

43:20.231 --> 43:23.329
I guess you do not know
with whom you are dealing.

43:41.585 --> 43:42.821
Thank you.

43:42.921 --> 43:45.223
That is the most ridiculous I
ever heard. Who does that?

43:45.323 --> 43:47.225
In my head it sounded like
a good idea.

43:47.325 --> 43:49.060
It sounded like a
James Bond thing, you know?

43:49.160 --> 43:52.831
Not at all, just like James Bond
had a very retarded brother.

43:52.931 --> 43:55.934
Fuck you, right?
Johnny Bond?

43:56.034 --> 43:58.201
So stupid.
And I do not even such things.

43:59.737 --> 44:01.273
You know what, though?

44:01.373 --> 44:04.276
You have to be man enough
to admit openly as a blunder.

44:04.376 --> 44:07.345
Well, there is at least one
bright side to all of this, right?

44:07.396 --> 44:10.967
No, I mean it. I feel
if I can trust you.

44:11.116 --> 44:14.019
Someone who is not willing to itself
to laugh, which you can not trust.

44:14.119 --> 44:17.808
Because when push comes to shove, they will
lie to save face.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.734
In this business, it
crazy and unstable

44:19.758 --> 44:23.061
to have people around you that you
only can trust in calm water.

44:23.161 --> 44:25.630
Because you want that
bring in big fish,

44:25.730 --> 44:29.100
then you have to go deep. And there
outside, you just have your crew.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.715
It sounds like
you really love sailing.

44:33.570 --> 44:36.739
I go get some balls to
what my father always said.

44:37.525 --> 44:39.504
Will you well with your dad?

44:39.644 --> 44:42.679
It's the only one I have.
As best as it can, right?

44:43.056 --> 44:44.479
Do you?

44:45.640 --> 44:47.824
What the guys talk out here?

44:48.053 --> 44:49.754
Fathers.

44:49.805 --> 44:52.828
- Okay, I'm going back inside.
- Why, you do not want to talk about fathers?

44:52.891 --> 44:54.793
I do not want two adult
men should talk about their fathers.

44:54.893 --> 44:58.430
You stand there in 5 minutes each
hand to hold and weep.

44:58.530 --> 45:00.131
Have you ever had a fist fight
had with your father?

45:00.231 --> 45:01.965
You mean like taken a beating?

45:01.966 --> 45:05.704
No no no. As man to man.
See who is the best.

45:05.755 --> 45:08.758
- Up to the last man.
- God, that's so boyish.

45:08.956 --> 45:12.326
Hey, you still. This is men talking
we are talking about here.

45:12.377 --> 45:15.914
How much would you have to have about our fathers here
now have? We admit to them, not an inch.

45:16.014 --> 45:20.652
Fucking "fuck you to me my whole life
to let want to impress on you, "

45:20.703 --> 45:23.573
- It would not be a fair fight.
- I mean well.

45:23.624 --> 45:24.824
That's the right idea!

45:24.956 --> 45:28.793
Especially since my father in the clinic
hangs on a ventilator.

45:28.893 --> 45:31.721
So yes.

45:33.597 --> 45:35.531
Shit, man.

45:35.833 --> 45:37.135
Johnny?

45:37.235 --> 45:39.602
No no. Fuck that.

45:40.904 --> 45:43.409
Fuck it, right?
Let us fight.

45:44.988 --> 45:48.612
Here he is.
Dad, I introduce you to my friends.

45:48.838 --> 45:52.117
Look, tell them how much
You're limo driver, you know.

45:52.217 --> 45:53.752
Your whole damn life.

45:53.852 --> 45:56.154
You know, those faceless guy in
the driver's seat which nobody knows

45:56.254 --> 45:59.724
where no one gives a shit about.
Tell them something about it.

45:59.824 --> 46:03.361
Lust you? Are you like the weakest
man in the whole damn street?

46:03.461 --> 46:05.506
You know, half
my life he was ill.

46:05.597 --> 46:07.399
Why do not you tell them about that?

46:07.499 --> 46:09.832
- You Lust it?
- Johnny ...

46:11.602 --> 46:13.538
Tell me about them all the
beautiful sermons that you gave your children.

46:13.638 --> 46:15.573
Give the best of yourself, you know?

46:15.673 --> 46:18.643
While you nothing with your life
have done except survive.

46:18.743 --> 46:20.979
I told you to quit smoking anyway, right?
I told you to quit smoking.

46:21.079 --> 46:23.381
You listen to anyone?
You listen to anyone!

46:23.481 --> 46:26.351
And now see where you are, you idiot!

46:26.451 --> 46:28.618
You do not fucking listen.

46:30.921 --> 46:32.121
Fuck.

46:40.125 --> 46:43.096
Hey, man, look,
you have to go home man.

46:43.180 --> 46:44.882
They're not going to take some X-ray.

46:44.933 --> 46:48.267
Really, take your girlfriend and go.
I feel so miserable enough already.

46:50.817 --> 46:52.251
Were you ever in Vegas?

46:53.912 --> 46:55.249
Yes.

46:55.300 --> 46:59.773
My father owns a few hotels there
and we're going to open one within 6 months.

46:59.984 --> 47:03.955
And I got the opportunity
this itself to exploit.

47:04.055 --> 47:08.126
How wonderful it would be the most
popular club in Vegas have?

47:08.226 --> 47:12.130
You know, something new,
something exciting,
something personal.

47:12.230 --> 47:14.564
Something to be remembered, you know?

47:15.631 --> 47:16.831
Sounds good.

47:17.488 --> 47:19.458
Really?

47:19.871 --> 47:24.524
Because I'm someone with real talent need,
I can trust to manage the business.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.909
- What about Mark.
What about Mark?

47:28.912 --> 47:31.282
Guys like Mark,Leaving New York is not.

47:31.382 --> 47:33.251
They have too much history.

47:33.351 --> 47:36.221
And a corporate history is much harder behind
let then any hope friends or family.

47:36.321 --> 47:40.410
Because you have to take it off at the root. The
Most men have the balls for it.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.195
I appreciate Sebastian.

47:44.295 --> 47:47.807
Really. But I have not the foggiest idea
how to run a club.

47:47.830 --> 47:50.599
- Never done it.
- Me neither.

47:50.731 --> 47:53.912
That sounds as though we had the whole thing
it will help to soap.

47:54.314 --> 47:55.779
I'm good at.

47:59.777 --> 48:02.563
It's just that my life is now complete
loggerheads, you know?

48:02.614 --> 48:05.517
I do not entrust all my problems.

48:05.617 --> 48:08.995
And I can not go anywhere,
with my father in this state, you know.

48:09.046 --> 48:10.313
It's just an idea.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.722
Excuse
Johnny Dadon?

48:13.657 --> 48:14.857
Yes.

48:15.592 --> 48:18.396
Okay man.
Thanks for coming.

48:18.496 --> 48:21.785
You did not have to do. I
appreciate it. I'm sorry for ...

48:22.566 --> 48:25.134
everything.
Good night.

48:27.905 --> 48:31.239
Do not ever driver Johnny.

48:31.608 --> 48:35.342
It is an honor to be a driver.
Really.

48:35.407 --> 48:38.919
But I think your future
somewhere beyond the glass is.

48:38.989 --> 48:40.256
I really do.

48:45.326 --> 48:47.091
Thanks again.

49:14.558 --> 49:16.394
Try sleeping mother.

49:18.822 --> 49:21.105
I'm worried.

49:25.205 --> 49:26.472
Me too.

49:27.196 --> 49:28.930
Well?
Me too.

49:29.828 --> 49:31.028
Johnny ...

49:35.786 --> 49:37.053
I can ...

49:42.322 --> 49:43.522
What?

49:45.082 --> 49:47.768
I can not lose your father.

49:48.007 --> 49:50.495
And you also lose.

49:52.437 --> 49:54.518
You're not going to lose my mother.

49:54.569 --> 49:56.347
- Promise?
Promised.

49:59.282 --> 50:01.979
Yes, I would like that.

50:03.406 --> 50:05.315
Ben, I'd like that.

50:05.649 --> 50:07.252
Yes, think about it.

50:07.672 --> 50:10.906
Okay, well, call me back.
Good day.

50:11.975 --> 50:14.512
That was this guy, Ben, who
Love that new club opened.

50:14.612 --> 50:17.248
We might even get
a night to benefit from.

50:17.299 --> 50:19.101
We might get a night to benefit from.

50:19.152 --> 50:20.987
- Yes.
- Fuck that, man.

50:21.038 --> 50:25.216
Forget to work for those guys.
We must make ourselves partners.

50:25.455 --> 50:27.825
- Partners with whom?
- In these clubs, with that guy.

50:27.925 --> 50:30.192
Which ... Which of the night
week is that club closed?

50:30.228 --> 50:33.031
- What? This club?
- Yes, that night which is closed?

50:33.131 --> 50:36.301
Monday and Tuesday,
why?

50:36.401 --> 50:37.957
Tell him we'll Tuesdays.

50:38.002 --> 50:40.536
Look, it's been closed.
Everything he earns extra.

50:40.605 --> 50:42.339
That guy does not even out of bed.

50:42.407 --> 50:44.776
If you want him more at ease
ask, tell him the guarantee.

50:44.876 --> 50:47.979
Ten thousand in beverage sales, right?
Everything we earn more, superb.

50:48.079 --> 50:49.914
Everything we lack
we fit.

50:50.014 --> 50:52.650
If there are eight thousand deserves,
we'll give him two out of our pocket.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.285
And how can we make money?

50:54.385 --> 50:56.587
We take a percentage of the entrance.
A good percentage.

50:56.687 --> 50:58.256
Most people pay to get in.

50:58.356 --> 51:00.992
Especially when we nicely dressed.

51:01.092 --> 51:04.395
I'm talking about tables, VIP
territories and drink bottles.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.431
We make it great. We have to think big.

51:06.531 --> 51:08.099
We'll make it the best day
of the week to go out.

51:08.199 --> 51:10.950
Make something of what people
will remember, you know?

51:11.035 --> 51:12.918
I think it's a good idea.

51:13.137 --> 51:14.185
No really.

51:14.286 --> 51:16.039
I do not know if he accepts a
will be but it is a good idea.

51:16.140 --> 51:20.718
Okay, if he agrees, you and
I now partners, right? In all.

51:20.845 --> 51:23.544
Half-Half.
- What did you say?

51:23.645 --> 51:24.913
Half-half.

51:25.388 --> 51:28.011
Johnny, do not get confused now.
I think it's a good idea.

51:28.052 --> 51:30.621
No chance that you
half-half gets. Not really.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.690
Okay, but listen. This is a new business.

51:32.790 --> 51:34.258
As if we start a new business.

51:34.358 --> 51:35.960
Without talent you can not do this.

51:36.060 --> 51:38.596
I can not do this without the stock.
We need each other.

51:38.696 --> 51:41.566
Half-half. It is an agreement.
It is a business.

51:41.666 --> 51:43.134
I was thinking only
Girls bring.

51:43.234 --> 51:45.837
Well are you Mr. Businessman.
I like it.

51:45.937 --> 51:48.439
I try. I'm just
was to make these people rich.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.341
You're good at what you are doing.
I'm good at what I do.

51:50.441 --> 51:51.809
So let's do it for ourselves.

51:51.909 --> 51:53.711
Okay, you know what? I go for it.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.947
I'll call him. But you can
better have a plan.

51:56.047 --> 51:58.282
It is very difficult to
Tuesday nice to dress.

51:58.382 --> 52:00.827
Do not worry, I have a plan.

52:01.047 --> 52:02.470
It's a good plan.

52:05.654 --> 52:08.392
<I> Stephanie got it right with yourself. </ I>

52:08.860 --> 52:10.294
It is one of the best
girls we

52:10.394 --> 52:13.506
What is obvious otherwise
You never are in this room.

52:13.888 --> 52:15.393
So ...

52:16.267 --> 52:19.301
You've piqued my interest.
Put it out.

52:20.202 --> 52:25.475
Okay, you hold one of the largest
modeling agencies in New York City ...

52:25.526 --> 52:26.961
Wrong opening.

52:27.111 --> 52:29.514
You owe me things to the
tell that I already know.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.483
Okay, again. Do you know where
your girls at night?

52:32.583 --> 52:35.820
Hopefully they are in the
rooms before we hire them.

52:35.920 --> 52:39.223
Right, right, right. Thinks
you think they stay there?

52:39.323 --> 52:41.726
Probably not. Girls stay girls.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.694
Yes, they go out.

52:43.794 --> 52:46.449
Probably. Are you going to make a point?

52:46.550 --> 52:49.220
Listen a little longer. Do you know where they go?

52:49.310 --> 52:51.017
Are you at all with who they are?

52:51.068 --> 52:54.865
Are you sometimes a detection device sir ...

52:54.964 --> 52:56.365
Johnny D.

52:56.433 --> 52:58.722
What?
- They call me Johnny D.

52:58.773 --> 53:01.509
Who?
- Your girls will call me so.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.859
- Oh Yeah?
- Yeah, you too.

53:03.918 --> 53:05.220
Yes?

53:05.562 --> 53:07.430
I do not think so.

53:07.481 --> 53:09.636
I think you will call me Johnny D.

53:09.687 --> 53:13.758
When you call me because you want to know
where and with whom you are girls

53:13.858 --> 53:15.860
What they are doing. And the
what they are not doing.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.295
You know what? I think you will call me

53:17.395 --> 53:20.131
because you want to know if they come home safely.

53:20.231 --> 53:23.568
And be ready to wake up and you a
lot of money to deliver the next morning.

53:23.668 --> 53:25.357
I brought you something.

53:27.070 --> 53:30.074
That's the number of this phone

53:30.174 --> 53:31.092
I always have with me.

53:31.143 --> 53:34.966
And I will not hesitate. 24 hours a day,
seven days per week. What then happens.

53:35.046 --> 53:36.747
You see? I am a detection device vendor,

53:36.847 --> 53:38.950
And the machine what I sell
is very reliable.

53:39.050 --> 53:41.185
And very good at what he does.

53:41.285 --> 53:44.720
And it gives you peace of mind a lot.

53:45.198 --> 53:47.465
Is not that what we all want?

53:51.628 --> 53:53.698
Sorry. Johnny D, How are you? Look ...

53:53.798 --> 53:56.767
Come. We start a new party
called Tuesday, honey, Tuesday.

53:56.867 --> 53:59.268
Hey, sorry. This is my business.
Hey, sorry, hello.

55:07.538 --> 55:10.026
You came, I knew you would come.
- All right, brother?

55:10.077 --> 55:12.772
Come on, follow me. I have a
great table for you.

55:13.021 --> 55:14.221
It starts.

55:16.946 --> 55:19.081
You all know what will happen

55:20.685 --> 55:23.485
Hey! Hey! Hey!

55:28.326 --> 55:32.296
That's what I mean. We hold
Tuesday, honey, Tuesday.

55:32.396 --> 55:35.566
We did it ourselves.
If you are to your liking,

55:35.666 --> 55:38.233
Let's hear it!

55:45.810 --> 55:47.011
Tuesday, honey, Tuesday.

55:47.111 --> 55:49.413
That's my secret weapon!
- Hey.

55:49.513 --> 55:52.717
We succeeded. We have
something special done tonight.

55:52.817 --> 55:54.719
It will only grow.
- We did it.

55:54.819 --> 55:56.354
Please.

55:56.454 --> 55:58.954
What is this?
- Your income.

55:59.923 --> 56:03.258
This is six to seven thousand dollars.
- It's $ 8,000.

56:04.494 --> 56:06.631
I do not get it. Midway
the evening I spoke with Ben,

56:06.731 --> 56:09.020
He said we were about 25 thousand.

56:09.378 --> 56:10.981
- Bobby has 15.
- Bobby?

56:11.121 --> 56:12.091
Yes.

56:12.214 --> 56:13.681
What Bobby has to do with this?

56:13.700 --> 56:16.336
Bobby holds a part of this tent.
You knew that.

56:16.640 --> 56:19.310
Why did not you tell me that
we have to deal with Bobby?

56:19.410 --> 56:22.480
Ben has never said anything about
take a portion of our revenue.

56:22.531 --> 56:24.132
Bobby'm not, okay?

56:24.281 --> 56:26.550
Okay. So you just packed up my money?

56:26.650 --> 56:29.165
Johnny, you're doing this now for five months.

56:29.282 --> 56:31.956
I'm doing this for 10 years. You need somewhere
pay your contribution. You know that.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.525
Fuck you, okay?
Do not do this, kid.

56:34.576 --> 56:36.043
Well not ruined something beautiful.

56:36.093 --> 56:37.795
No, fuck off!
You're a coward, you know?

56:37.846 --> 56:40.749
In what universe do you think the
okay is if I get only 25%?

56:40.800 --> 56:44.736
This whole plan was my idea and now
trying to buy me off so cheap?

56:44.814 --> 56:48.392
Wow, wow, wow. Take it easy. Take it easy.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.900
Is this a trap?
- I did not even know he was coming.

56:50.975 --> 56:52.710
Wait a second.
Let's go back.

56:52.810 --> 56:57.815
I want to understand this, what was his idea who?
I heard ... What was his idea who?

56:57.915 --> 57:01.485
You think this was your idea?

57:01.585 --> 57:04.386
There are no original ideas in this industry.

57:05.094 --> 57:06.363
Do you understand?

57:06.690 --> 57:08.157
What was your idea?

57:08.797 --> 57:10.064
The club?

57:10.358 --> 57:11.558
Mine.

57:11.609 --> 57:14.043
Patrons? Mine.

57:15.131 --> 57:17.702
And the music?
Busta Rhymes.

57:17.802 --> 57:19.437
Do you think he has come to you?

57:19.537 --> 57:23.797
I know him from Flatbush, Uniondale, idiot.
Ever since he was a child.

57:25.141 --> 57:27.378
It's the girls. That's it.

57:27.478 --> 57:29.972
Do you think you deserve more from the girls.

57:30.073 --> 57:32.616
We do that as since the
origin of humanity,

57:32.716 --> 57:35.353
And now you've decided because
you do it on a Tuesday?

57:35.453 --> 57:37.088
- Is that it?
- Bobby, he's just drunk.

57:37.188 --> 57:39.023
Stay out there, Mark?
Mind you just leave it alone.

57:39.123 --> 57:41.292
I do not care that he was drunk.

57:41.392 --> 57:43.294
Is that it? Do you think you deserve more than me?

57:43.394 --> 57:45.928
- Yeah, I think so.
- You think you deserve more than me?

57:46.247 --> 57:47.450
You stupid bitch!

57:47.976 --> 57:49.247
I love you.

57:49.388 --> 57:51.934
I love you bitch. Do you understand?

57:53.102 --> 57:55.237
You made me proud today.

57:55.805 --> 57:57.005
I'm happy.

57:57.178 --> 58:01.001
Look at me.
I'm very proud of you.

58:04.588 --> 58:06.022
You get this part.

58:07.217 --> 58:09.754
We are going to take over this city.

58:09.854 --> 58:13.810
Once you become my partner. Mark my words.

58:18.194 --> 58:21.232
Come on. What is it?
Come on. Are you jealous?

58:21.332 --> 58:25.102
Come on,
do not be jealous. Do not be jealous.

58:25.202 --> 58:27.605
Sometimes that. Learner
sometimes surpasses the master.

58:27.705 --> 58:28.443
That happens sometimes.

58:28.544 --> 58:31.295
That means you have to work harder.

58:32.041 --> 58:33.308
This child has talent.

58:35.345 --> 58:38.013
Well, both, from my club.

58:38.815 --> 58:40.282
Let yourself nice pipes.

58:41.284 --> 58:43.254
Hopefully not mix.

58:43.354 --> 58:47.691
- You'll feel very well about yourself.
- Now it is.

58:47.791 --> 58:51.128
You know why I'm still in this job?
Because I'm smart.

58:51.228 --> 58:53.264
I have met people who 10
times smarter than I was

58:53.364 --> 58:55.966
But all of them
could think was that money.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.168
And they thought that they meant something.

58:57.268 --> 58:58.836
Nobody does not matter here!

58:58.936 --> 59:00.838
Not me, Bobby, no one.

59:00.938 --> 59:02.373
Certainly not a stupid boy

59:02.473 --> 59:05.776
who throughout his career at the
play sets for $ 4,000.

59:05.876 --> 59:07.745
What's your problem, Mark?

59:07.845 --> 59:10.481
Want the rest of your life
of other people's leftovers life?

59:10.581 --> 59:12.378
Would you like to help everyone
to impress his customers?

59:12.479 --> 59:13.370
They should be our customers.

59:13.510 --> 59:16.081
Guys like Bobby would this game
must lead. We must do that.

59:16.282 --> 59:19.155
Especially after what we achieved tonight.
You just have to have some guts.

59:19.256 --> 59:21.323
Do not be afraid to take risks.

59:22.528 --> 59:24.395
- Risk taking?
- Yes, take risks.

59:25.575 --> 59:28.444
There is no us.
We are ready together.

59:29.620 --> 59:30.820
Crazy huh?

59:31.201 --> 59:33.370
In a second, you do not matter anymore.

59:33.470 --> 59:35.306
Tomorrow I meet another Johnny D.

59:35.406 --> 59:38.275
You will never meet anyone like me.

59:38.375 --> 59:40.722
Stay with me away and
Stay away from Bobby.

59:40.823 --> 59:43.681
- Get your finger out of my face.
- Stay with me away.

59:43.781 --> 59:46.682
- You are a coward.
- You are an asshole.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.174
Tanya?

01:00:43.147 --> 01:00:45.547
You have five minutes, okay?
But you must not tell anyone.

01:00:45.648 --> 01:00:47.749
- I could lose my job if they see you.
- Good.

01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:50.881
Me and my girl?
Just for drinks. I ...

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.583
I can no problems
have the door you know?

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:55.052
You're not in trouble.
You're worth gold. Thank You.

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:56.886
- Oke, it's fine ..
- Thank You.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:07.296
Hey, Dad.

01:01:10.994 --> 01:01:14.170
I hate the sound that these machines.

01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:18.373
You will be fixed crazy. I
know they help you anyway.

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:23.912
You know what it is, Dad.

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:28.059
I've really needed now.

01:01:28.983 --> 01:01:30.951
I'm really distraught.

01:01:32.187 --> 01:01:34.899
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:01:36.277 --> 01:01:39.700
I tried to do something good. Really.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:44.385
It just feels like everything I do

01:01:44.436 --> 01:01:47.385
Slips through my fingers.

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:51.805
Tanya is gone. You were right.

01:01:51.856 --> 01:01:54.323
She's smart and she has gone away from me.

01:01:56.101 --> 01:02:01.140
Mommy ...
Mama and Sarah think I'm crazy.

01:02:01.498 --> 01:02:06.303
You just gotta be strong this once porridge.
Why could not you be strong?

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.393
I've had enough of always
having to take care of you.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:12.463
I can not take care of them.
I'm not ready.

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:15.052
I can not even take care of myself.

01:02:16.049 --> 01:02:17.449
Fuck, Dad.

01:02:18.654 --> 01:02:20.155
Jesus!

01:02:25.327 --> 01:02:27.460
Somebody help!

01:02:39.082 --> 01:02:41.850
Thank you for everything you've done.

01:02:55.595 --> 01:02:56.795
How you doing, Mom?

01:03:04.591 --> 01:03:06.014
It's been better.

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:11.019
Yes, I'll be back.

01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:16.940
Sebastian, hold on.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:25.144
We do it.
The Vegas deal. I participate.

01:03:25.212 --> 01:03:26.780
I'll leave you alone.

01:03:26.932 --> 01:03:29.243
Thanks a lot, man.
- Sorry.

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:31.942
We do it.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:33.677
Well, here's the plan.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.273
My father is next Tuesday in New York.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.155
It is perfect, it can not
wait to get a look.

01:03:39.255 --> 01:03:41.150
Tuesday, honey, Tuesday.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:45.622
My father does not know you, let's see
how Johnny D night expires.

01:03:45.722 --> 01:03:49.259
All right, man. We do it.
We let him see it.

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:51.628
I'll let you know more tomorrow.

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:54.932
Thanks, I appreciate that you're here.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:57.299
Be strong.
- I go for it.

01:03:57.512 --> 01:03:58.712
We go there for.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.724
Bobby, listen,
There comes Tuesday a major customer.

01:04:09.084 --> 01:04:11.248
That I understand that but if it's there for.

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:14.810
One moment you're in.
The next minute you let them lie left

01:04:15.719 --> 01:04:18.645
Never Bite the hand that feeds them.

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:21.158
Mark let everyone look at you out.

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:23.689
At this time no one would be yours.

01:04:23.827 --> 01:04:26.230
Earlier we had
here to say.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.869
Or was that a lot of nonsense?
"You and I are partners,"

01:04:30.883 --> 01:04:33.036
I was drunk that night well, buddy.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:34.858
<I> I said as much. </ I>

01:04:34.909 --> 01:04:38.606
I would my 17 year old niece in her
ass fucking in the name of love

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.257
You take me to blame?

01:04:40.329 --> 01:04:41.745
Good luck.

01:04:41.845 --> 01:04:44.515
That you do not believe,
nobody believes that.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:47.885
Good luck is another way
to say "Fuck it", right?

01:04:47.985 --> 01:04:50.518
I'm glad that I can learn something.

01:04:51.284 --> 01:04:52.517
Get lost.

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:05.867
Not yet. So Pop's doing it?

01:05:08.591 --> 01:05:09.893
Shit.

01:05:10.008 --> 01:05:13.075
If we change the plan
your dad will then join?

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:17.014
Tell him yet
that the plan change, okay?

01:05:17.065 --> 01:05:19.465
The less we share the plan with people
that belong to Mark of Bobby, the better.

01:05:19.466 --> 01:05:21.267
I have a great here
party on Tuesday night.

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:24.341
I take everyone here, and guarantee
You revenues of $ 20,000.

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:26.890
There is a chance that it might
it is $ 25,000.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.557
At this time can
we do not.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:31.660
I'm actually looking for
space for Tuesday.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:36.798
No, I would not say we're at
it compete on Tuesday.

01:05:45.943 --> 01:05:49.713
Tell me that we have a place?
- We're getting close.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:52.716
Tuesday is over 3 days, Johnny.
- It'll be fine.

01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:55.128
I must tell him tonight
we swap places.

01:05:55.152 --> 01:05:58.481
I hear you, it's time to
thinking outside your comfort zone.

01:05:58.536 --> 01:06:01.525
What are you doing?
- I try to find a place.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:03.181
I'll call you later.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.768
Why should I help you?

01:06:10.819 --> 01:06:13.288
We share the same enemy.
- Yeah, what did you do?

01:06:13.409 --> 01:06:15.011
Do you sucked mark?

01:06:15.175 --> 01:06:16.589
You let Bobby fuck you?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.575
How to steal someone I have
never heard of,

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.744
and just emerges my show?

01:06:20.844 --> 01:06:23.413
Will you play it, Jerome?

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:27.303
I did not steal your show, I
do not even know what I was doing.

01:06:27.543 --> 01:06:29.188
And let's be honest,

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:32.222
they arrange everything for you
because you yourself can not.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:36.091
Dude, fuck off!
See this scar?

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.128
Yes.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.564
This is not a game, Johnny.
They screwed up my life.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:43.932
We'll get them, okay?
Let's strike back.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.737
Think about it.

01:06:46.788 --> 01:06:49.323
Mark, why would I want with you
work, you have no talent?

01:06:49.374 --> 01:06:51.851
I have the plan but have
just need a place.

01:06:51.902 --> 01:06:53.672
When?
- Tuesday.

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:56.046
A Tuesday?
- Why is that funny?

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.849
Because you're taking on the
your own problems.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.835
You turn long enough
with because viz.

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:03.420
You deal Tuesday
and pushing everyone away.

01:07:03.471 --> 01:07:05.973
I push one way that
is not my tactics.

01:07:06.025 --> 01:07:08.849
Their marks, they are doing this for years.

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.735
He wants to wipe a club card,

01:07:10.786 --> 01:07:13.689
He calls the police and become the club
evacuated because of underage girls.

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.809
They lose their license
and then it's over.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.772
So he does it on Tuesday
in order to make his point.

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.739
Now you're here and you ask again?

01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:24.875
It is a very big party.

01:07:24.975 --> 01:07:27.444
A celebration where we both
a lot of money to earn.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.479
And you can put it back on the map.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:31.097
I do not need your help.

01:07:31.708 --> 01:07:32.743
Yes.

01:07:32.865 --> 01:07:35.267
You can trust me, Jerome.

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.688
You can trust me.

01:07:37.788 --> 01:07:39.756
I dedicate this to Simon,

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:43.593
and it is the only decent
club that wants to talk to me.

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:45.039
Okay.

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:47.693
They really are the dick as Mark
the club late storm.

01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:51.891
If you know something pulls it
he is known for.

01:07:51.942 --> 01:07:53.687
Succeeds for Tuesday?

01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:55.730
Probably.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:08:00.911
Someone once said you have power
radiate even though you do not have.

01:08:01.011 --> 01:08:03.460
For the time that they discover
you do not you get it.

01:08:03.511 --> 01:08:07.115
I know and that person is a jerk.

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.433
Do you know him?

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:11.587
We'll keep in touch.

01:08:12.623 --> 01:08:13.823
Where are you going?

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.225
I need some help.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.725
Jerome is back!

01:08:27.553 --> 01:08:28.752
Hey, Johnny.

01:08:29.006 --> 01:08:29.951
Hi.

01:08:30.002 --> 01:08:32.636
I'll wait downstairs.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.367
Sorry.

01:08:37.716 --> 01:08:39.828
Tanya, I'm sorry.

01:08:41.595 --> 01:08:42.919
For what?

01:08:43.629 --> 01:08:46.729
You do not make it easy on me?
- No.

01:08:49.314 --> 01:08:52.419
Look, I was in a bad position.

01:08:52.691 --> 01:08:55.192
My father and ...
- Stop!

01:08:56.710 --> 01:09:00.948
Do not blame him, he
has nothing to do with it.

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.740
This is all your fault, Johnny.

01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:06.995
As if you wanted to escape us.

01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:10.832
You act like you make the world a
pleasure doing to live here.

01:09:10.884 --> 01:09:13.912
As if we all weights
that pull you down.

01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:15.750
I know, I ...

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.755
I think that it's true
I was always afraid.

01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:21.412
I never figured out where I came from.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:28.216
You always wanted away, since you were 10.

01:09:28.267 --> 01:09:30.819
I had forgotten that we
knew each other for so long.

01:09:31.629 --> 01:09:32.828
Me too.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:39.955
How's your new friend?

01:09:40.126 --> 01:09:43.995
It's your business, but it
has been out since last week.

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:48.390
Sorry.
- I'm not you.

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:50.703
No.

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:53.756
Is there something I
can do for you, Johnny?

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:55.992
Look, this is not the reason
why I'm here,

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:58.728
but I need your help.

01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:01.549
You do have guts.

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.501
You do not do it,

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:06.603
but I'm doing something.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.506
I have a very smart, talented,

01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:12.695
and a very sexy designer needed.

01:10:13.045 --> 01:10:15.223
You're the only one who agrees.

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:18.390
And below you will never
talk to me. You can,

01:10:18.441 --> 01:10:20.650
something beginning with that guy,

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.351
and can leave for
which you want.

01:10:24.616 --> 01:10:27.741
You're crazy.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:28.992
Okay?

01:10:40.237 --> 01:10:41.799
Bring me good news.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:47.275
Beautiful! That's good news.

01:10:58.454 --> 01:11:01.158
Hello?
- How is my princess Stephanie?

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:04.060
Johnny.
- I need you on Tuesday.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.472
I really need and want
everyone you can.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:08.899
The only thing is that we
do on Tuesday.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:10.467
We try something else, okay?

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:13.170
Anything you want, Johnny.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:16.106
Ready for a party?
- I know you will anyway.

01:11:16.206 --> 01:11:17.264
Of course.

01:11:17.315 --> 01:11:20.600
My dad comes around 21:00
he wants to go out around 23:00.

01:11:21.429 --> 01:11:22.932
Enough time.
- Do you think?

01:11:22.983 --> 01:11:24.783
No.

01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:34.389
I love it.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.806
I'll take it.
- We have a deal.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:56.588
Here we go, man.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.615
Are you ready? It's time.

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:02.485
Ask soon as it's over.
- I could not have done it without you

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:05.019
See you there.
- Okay.

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.668
Mark.

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:21.746
I do not get it. Why do we go
not to "Tuesday, baby, Tuesday"?

01:12:21.789 --> 01:12:23.656
I've heard a lot about.

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:26.977
As my friend, Johnny, who
"Tuesday, baby, Tuesday" has devised,

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:29.212
has something else.

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:31.224
You taught me always
to follow the source.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:35.085
Everything I've heard is that
Mark Cohen was the creator.

01:12:35.185 --> 01:12:37.687
Mark was involved ...
- Seb,

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.789
there's something you need to learn.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:44.033
People always try the credits
someone's hard work to pick at.

01:12:44.084 --> 01:12:45.895
It is a parasitic world.

01:12:45.995 --> 01:12:48.231
Mark has long been my husband.

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:49.766
Loyalty is also important.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.030
Not if it's the wrong guest.

01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:55.765
Let's face it.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.110
But first I want to see
where Mark is capable.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:04.112
Frank, drive us please to Love club.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.547
We will see.

01:13:10.808 --> 01:13:13.590
Big Willie!
- Mark, how are you?

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:16.226
How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:13:16.326 --> 01:13:17.560
Good to see you.

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:19.329
What do you do, still
all over the world?

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.931
I do my best, this is
my son Sebastian.

01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:23.500
Good to see you.
- Mark.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.935
Why did not you say you were coming?
- Change at the last minute.

01:13:26.021 --> 01:13:29.125
Welcome, sit down.
- Thank you.

01:13:30.356 --> 01:13:33.629
I hear a lot about this place,

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.528
and was wondering what you made of it.

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:40.083
And it's very beautiful, magnificent.

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:44.187
But I must say that this is not,

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:48.325
which is where the people
talk, what's going on?

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:52.625
The economy takes its toll
about this whole business.

01:13:52.676 --> 01:13:54.344
Everybody get hit, believe me.

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:58.601
I want to ask you something about Johnny.

01:13:58.701 --> 01:14:00.836
I've heard you him
have taken under your care,

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:04.540
and Sebastian says he
your secret weapon.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:07.632
That word asserted there.
- Really? Secret weapon?

01:14:07.796 --> 01:14:11.213
No secret weapon, that boy
was a huge disappointment,

01:14:11.264 --> 01:14:13.164
these are all talk.

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:14.415
Really?
- Yes.

01:14:14.502 --> 01:14:17.930
You can not believe everything you hear.
- Boys in blue?

01:14:19.555 --> 01:14:23.094
I want to see how he perished
go, give me a minute.

01:14:23.145 --> 01:14:24.469
Okay.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:27.097
I'm sorry, but I really should go.

01:14:27.148 --> 01:14:29.884
Something has intervened,
about 15 minutes, I am back.

01:14:29.935 --> 01:14:31.624
Do not worry, do what you gotta do.

01:14:31.768 --> 01:14:34.003
I will make sure that
you have a good time.

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.640
I think Cathy's here somewhere,
which will come say hello.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:40.143
Nice to see you, Sebastian.
- You too.

01:14:40.194 --> 01:14:43.197
Cathy, I want you to meet my friends.

01:14:43.295 --> 01:14:46.007
Amuse you but you Cathy,
Chris will provide drinks.

01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:47.230
Hi, Cathy.

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:50.787
Johnny, there is an outside issue.
- What problem?

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:53.094
Police.
- Police?

01:14:53.145 --> 01:14:55.445
Police.
- Stay here.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.065
<I> So you're saying that there are no
underage girls? </ i>

01:15:02.165 --> 01:15:05.101
I'm not the bouncer
but in my not knowing.

01:15:05.152 --> 01:15:07.755
I'm going to lock you up if it is so, understand?

01:15:07.895 --> 01:15:09.374
Aside.

01:15:12.011 --> 01:15:14.272
Hey, open it.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.584
Maybe we do not get
the evening as promised ,.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:25.555
But we can not blame Mark
Giving the poor economy.

01:15:25.655 --> 01:15:29.893
Of course, I attack him
about his attitude and vision.

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:31.325
That you should do also.

01:15:32.451 --> 01:15:34.853
Are there problems, buddy?

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.346
Do you really think the party
would go unnoticed?

01:15:39.419 --> 01:15:40.619
Really?

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:43.293
I've always said that I
The king was in the jungle.

01:15:43.339 --> 01:15:45.306
Nothing happens here without I know.

01:15:46.074 --> 01:15:47.777
That was you forget, right?

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:52.782
Where Johnny is going,
He can not blame the people.

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.018
He forces them and run them.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:58.688
You just heard what
Mark said about this Johnny.

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:02.625
This is the city of me and Bobby,
I have always told you.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:06.227
No child like you
it takes ever.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.949
I think you are no longer a coward.

01:16:10.099 --> 01:16:14.103
You're a coward if you're worth
and you're not sure to enter.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.673
I think you're exactly
are where you should be.

01:16:16.773 --> 01:16:18.007
We shall see.

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:20.474
Mark! Come here,

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.779
are you kidding me?

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:25.342
Will you show us look like morons?

01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:29.830
Call Bobby and tell that
jerk that he is not wise.

01:16:30.119 --> 01:16:32.822
I understand you should not
a misunderstanding.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:36.125
Misunderstanding? Do they look like
underage girls?

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:37.534
Dork.

01:16:37.585 --> 01:16:40.519
What is wrong with you? Would you like us
elderly club dropped inside?

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:43.299
If you ever again
gives wrong information,

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:44.985
it will allow you dearly.

01:16:45.036 --> 01:16:46.905
Do you hear me? Now fuck off.

01:16:46.956 --> 01:16:49.258
Understood?
- Sorry. I ...

01:16:49.457 --> 01:16:52.160
Why do not you smile at the camera, Marky?

01:16:52.268 --> 01:16:54.671
What are you doing?
- Come here.

01:16:54.722 --> 01:16:56.662
I love to see you there.

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:58.381
Listen!

01:16:58.481 --> 01:17:00.793
Good work, make sure you
send to anyone, okay?

01:17:00.883 --> 01:17:03.586
I think you have to pack hit,
Call me if you need anything.

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:08.124
Mark, this is for you and you can
also give Bobby. Good luck.

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:10.894
Rot here.
- Okay.

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.962
Get out of here or I'll lock you up.

01:17:13.062 --> 01:17:14.764
I'll kill you.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:17.502
You two, also gone.

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:30.242
Sebastian, are you sure
this is the right place?

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:32.577
I think so.

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.622
This is fun.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.828
Sebastian, this is my
only day in New York.

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:50.922
My idea of â€‹â€‹fun is not
Looking to move to any party.

01:17:52.994 --> 01:17:55.094
Have a little faith, Dad.

01:18:01.403 --> 01:18:04.139
Tyler men, we
expect you already.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.716
Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:18:06.816 --> 01:18:08.783
Welcome. Follow me.

01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:15.770
The great Johnny did this?

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:20.751
I've had a lot of help.

01:18:21.722 --> 01:18:24.827
Dad, my friend, my magician.

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:29.570
The man I'm going to learn a great deal
to close next year, Johnny D.

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.645
My evening is not complete,

01:18:35.745 --> 01:18:37.946
until I you the best night
I worried of your life.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:40.525
Ginger! We have a
nice table for you.

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:43.561
You know where to find me.
- Thank You.

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:44.819
Lots of fun.

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:51.337
Thanks, man.
Thank you for believing in me.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.431
You made it easy.

01:18:54.895 --> 01:18:56.497
This is just the beginning.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:19:00.800
The beginning, a lot of fun tonight.

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:13.116
Not bad for a girl
in Midwood, Brooklyn?

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:14.982
This is for anyone bad.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:19.022
You look beautiful.
- Thank You.

01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:20.723
You've done well tonight.

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:24.327
We.
- We.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:27.428
I love you, you know that?

01:20:50.245 --> 01:20:51.814
People.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:21:00.523
My design team
table 15 needs me.

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:02.191
Tomorrow slow
are to day.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.694
You may need to take time off.
- That's good news.

01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:08.064
Sebastian has signed for the lamps.
- Beautiful.

01:21:08.164 --> 01:21:11.320
And your mother I have to make
make sure you're there tomorrow.

01:21:11.334 --> 01:21:13.402
I'll be there.

01:21:13.502 --> 01:21:16.939
I should get back to
my drunken guests there.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.374
Not too much fun, okay?

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:21.453
I'm going to have fun, love you.
- I love you.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.253
It is universal.

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:27.757
The adrenaline rush you get when
you come across the Brooklyn Bridge,

01:25:27.857 --> 01:25:30.159
and the skyline comes into view.

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:34.130
The fog which comes from
Niagara Falls,

01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:36.332
I love NY.

01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:39.201
Families who pick apples in
Hudson Valley,

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.104
or speedboat
along the thousands of islands.

01:25:42.204 --> 01:25:45.508
But there is another reason
why I love New York.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:49.645
New York is a constant
form of discovery.

01:25:49.745 --> 01:25:53.482
You want to see what's around the
angle is, over the hill,

01:25:53.582 --> 01:25:57.720
