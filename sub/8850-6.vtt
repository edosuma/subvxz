WHAT DID YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAID
GENERAL GRANT'S MEN

11:44.838 --> 11:47.941
MURDERED YOUR FAMILY?

11:47.975 --> 11:49.142
LOOK, IF I'M GONNA WRITE
THE TRUTH, I'M GONNA NEED YOUR--

11:49.176 --> 11:50.811

12:05.392 --> 12:08.929

I PROVIDED YOU WITH INFORMATION,
YOU'D PROTECT ME.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.375

DID YOU KNOW THAT?

12:22.409 --> 12:25.445
- [sighs]

12:25.478 --> 12:29.216
- THERE IS NOTHING
IN MY HERITAGE, MY PEOPLE,

12:29.249 --> 12:30.918
WHERE THEY CAME FROM,

12:30.951 --> 12:33.553
THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD,
TO GIVE ME EVEN

12:33.586 --> 12:39.559
THE SLIGHTEST LEG UP
ON WHAT IS TO BE MY DESTINY.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.495
THE SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKS
WAS MY TEACHER.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.897
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I LEARNED?

12:43.931 --> 12:46.199
- IF MR. BOHANNON FINDS OUT THAT

12:46.233 --> 12:47.835
I'VE BEEN FEEDING YOU INFOR--
- THAT A MAN WHO IS ENCUMBERED

12:47.868 --> 12:49.402
BY WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG

12:49.436 --> 12:51.071

12:51.104 --> 12:53.106

- I AM NOT ENCUMBERED
BY WHAT ENCUMBERS MOST MEN

12:56.443 --> 13:00.247
BECAUSE I AM NOT MOST MEN.

13:00.280 --> 13:04.217
I THOUGHT I SAW
THE SAME POTENTIAL IN YOU.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.254
IF I WAS MISTAKEN...

13:07.287 --> 13:10.290
YOU'LL HAVE NO ONE
TO BLAME BUT YOURSELF.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.395
I WILL REMIND YOU, MISS ELLISON,
THAT YOU ARE

13:15.428 --> 13:18.265
UNDER A MORAL OBLIGATION

13:18.298 --> 13:22.435
AS YOU KNOW IT, FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.438
- I UNDERSTAND.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.408
- YOU HAVE WRITTEN NUMEROUS
ARTICLES ABOUT MR. BOHANNON

13:28.441 --> 13:30.844
FOR THE NEW-YORK TRIBUNE
SINCE YOUR ASSIGNMENT

13:30.878 --> 13:34.147

- YES.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.949
- YOU KNOW HIM WELL?

13:35.983 --> 13:39.552
- I-I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
KNOWS HIM WELL.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.622
- AH, WELL, KEEPS TO HIMSELF,
DOES HE?

13:42.655 --> 13:46.593
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
- WHAT DID YOU MEAN?

13:46.626 --> 13:52.065
- WELL, HE'S NOT
THE CHATTIEST PERSON, AND HE'S--

13:52.099 --> 13:54.601
- A BULLY.
- NO, I WAS GOING TO SAY--

13:54.634 --> 13:57.204
- DIDN'T YOU WRITE A STORY
ABOUT MR. BOHANNON'S DECISION

13:57.237 --> 13:59.206
TO HANG THE HATCH BOY?

13:59.239 --> 14:00.507
- YES.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.275
- YOU DESCRIBED HELL ON WHEELS

14:02.309 --> 14:07.047
AS A SODOM AND GOMORRAH
OF THE NEBRASKA PLAINS,

14:07.080 --> 14:10.383
WITH MR. BOHANNON AS ITS LOT.
HMM.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.419
WELL, SURELY YOU DON'T CONDEMN
THE CHIEF ENGINEER

14:12.452 --> 14:15.422
OF THE UNION PACIFIC
FOR PERFORMING HIS DUTY

14:15.455 --> 14:18.458
AND PUNISHING THE MURDERER
OF HIS CHIEF OF POLICE?

14:18.491 --> 14:21.661
- YOU CAN, AND YOU MUST,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.630
IF YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN
THAT THE MAN

14:23.663 --> 14:26.199
HE LYNCHED COMMITTED THE CRIMES
FOR WHICH HE WAS HUNG.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.369
- ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT MR. BOHANNON,

14:29.402 --> 14:32.105
IN THE NAME
OF THE UNION PACIFIC,

14:32.139 --> 14:34.107
HANGED AN INNOCENT MAN?

14:34.141 --> 14:38.946
- THE BOY IN QUESTION WAS
SUSPECTED OF THE TRANSGRESSION,

14:38.979 --> 14:41.114
BUT NO ONE WAS ABLE TO SAY,

14:41.148 --> 14:44.051
DEFINITIVELY,
THAT HE HAD DONE IT.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.619
I MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXAMINED
HIS SKULL IN THE AFTERMATH

14:46.653 --> 14:50.357
AND FOUND NOTHING TO SUGGEST
CRIMINAL TENDENCIES.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.127
- AND THE BOY WAS, WHAT, 17?

14:54.161 --> 14:56.463
AND QUITE DEVOUT,
I UNDERSTAND.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.598
- MR. BOHANNON ASKED ME
IF I'D HAD OCCASION

14:58.631 --> 15:01.634
TO KNOW WHAT THE MORMONS
ARE LIKE, AS A PEOPLE.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.907
HOW THEY MIGHT REACT
TO BEING FORCED OFF THEIR LAND.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.048
HE ASKED ME IF I THOUGHT
THEY WOULD FIGHT.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.518
- HMM, SOUNDS LIKE
HE WAS LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.989
- NOT A FIGHT.
IT WAS A BABY.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.424
ALONG WITH MR. FERGUSON, SIR.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.460
- AND YET, IT WAS MR. BOHANNON

15:27.494 --> 15:29.196
WHO GAVE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE,

15:29.229 --> 15:33.433
YOUR EMPLOYEE
AND HER HAPLESS SUITOR, A PISTOL

15:33.466 --> 15:38.071
AND BULLETS AND LEFT THEM
TO DIE IN THE WILDERNESS.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.040
- HE HANDED THEM A GUN, YEAH.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.410
- DID YOU WITNESS
THIS INHUMANITY?

15:43.443 --> 15:48.681
- NO, SIR, UM, BUT MR. BOHANNON
TOLD ME ABOUT IT, YEAH.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.518
- AH.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.686
BRAGGING, NO DOUBT.
- BULLSHIT.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.455
- AGAIN, SIR,
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.224
- AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

15:57.257 --> 15:58.525
- WHAT, MR. BOHANNON?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.693
- A TOTAL MIS-RETELLING
OF EVENTS.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.095
DECISIONS HAD TO BE MADE,

16:02.129 --> 16:03.296
IT FELL TO ME TO MAKE THEM,

16:03.330 --> 16:04.664
THE RAILROAD
HAD TO MOVE FORWARD.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.400
- YOU'RE TWO WEEKS BEHIND,
ARE YOU NOT?

16:07.434 --> 16:09.269
OVER THE DECISION YOU MADE

16:09.302 --> 16:13.706
NOT TO MOVE CAMP WHILE YOU
SEARCHED FOR A WHORE'S BABY.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.276
OR AM I MIS-RETELLING THAT?

16:18.378 --> 16:22.082
- THESE ARE COMPLICATED ISSUES,
MR. BOHANNON,

16:22.115 --> 16:25.218
WITH SERIOUS PUBLIC
AND FIDUCIARY RAMIFICATIONS.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.254
AND AS STOCKHOLDERS
OF THIS COMPANY,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.456
WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO EXPLORE THEM,

16:29.489 --> 16:31.991
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.615
- HMM.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.288
SO YOU WAS A SOLDIER, HUH?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.523
WHERE'D YOU FIGHT?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.592
- I MARCHED WITH SHERMAN.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.661
- IN MISSISSIPPI?

17:08.695 --> 17:12.332
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

17:12.365 --> 17:16.236
- LOOKING FOR RAILROAD WORK.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.406
[gasps]

17:19.439 --> 17:21.541
- YOU AIN'T NEVER DID
NO RAILROAD WORK.

17:25.445 --> 17:29.549
WAS YOU WITH THEM BOYS
THAT KILLED BOHANNON FAMILY?

17:29.582 --> 17:32.585
YOU COME HERE FOR REVENGE?

17:35.688 --> 17:37.190
- MY BROTHER WAS MURDERED,

17:37.224 --> 17:41.828
IN A CHURCH,
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.534
THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECKONING.
- AIN'T GONNA BE NONE!

17:47.567 --> 17:50.470
'CAUSE YOU GONNA BE GONE.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.387
[train whistle blows]

18:16.329 --> 18:20.567
[train whistle blows]

18:20.600 --> 18:22.335
- MR. FERGUSON...

18:22.369 --> 18:25.538
IS MR. BOHANNON,
FORMERLY A KILLER--

18:25.572 --> 18:29.342
UH, PARDONED, BY LAW,
FOR THOSE SINS--

18:29.376 --> 18:34.447
STILL, IN YOUR OPINION,
CAPABLE OF KILLING A MAN?

18:38.218 --> 18:41.154
- I SUPPOSE HE WOULD KILL

18:41.188 --> 18:43.323
IF ANOTHER MAN TRIED
TO KILL HIM.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.326
- THAT WAS NOT THE QUESTION.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.729
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM KILL A MAN?

18:55.268 --> 18:57.270
YES OR NO?

19:01.541 --> 19:04.277
- YES.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.681
- HOW RECENTLY, MR. FERGUSON?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.722
- RECENT.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.192
- RECENT.

19:21.394 --> 19:24.897
EH, NO MORE QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU, MR. FERGUSON.

19:24.931 --> 19:28.835
- I MOVE WE CLEAR THE ROOM,
GO INTO EXECUTIVE SESSION,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.638
AND VOTE ON WHETHER TO RETAIN

19:31.671 --> 19:35.408
OR RELIEVE MR. BOHANNON
OF HIS POSITION.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.610
ALL IN FAVOR OF THE MOTION?

19:37.644 --> 19:40.947
both: AYE.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.583
- AYE.

19:59.666 --> 20:03.002
- HERE.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.504
- WHAT IS THAT?

20:04.537 --> 20:05.772
- A CONTRACT, BINDING YOU
TO THE RAILROAD,

20:05.805 --> 20:09.709
WHETHER I'M HERE OR NOT.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.744
- BOHANNON.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.387
[train whistle blows]

20:37.337 --> 20:38.738
- [sighs]

20:38.771 --> 20:41.841
- WE'RE ALWAYS
THE FIRST TO GO.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.912
THE SALOON AND THE...WHOREHOUSE,
THE LAST.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.948
WHY DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT IS,
MR. BOHANNON?

20:51.017 --> 20:54.020
- SIN TAKES LONGER TO PACK.

20:56.523 --> 20:59.359
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED?

20:59.392 --> 21:00.827
- I'M SORRY FOR MY PART
IN WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.363
- NO, YOU SPOKE HONEST.
- NO, BUT I FAILED TO TELL--

21:03.396 --> 21:07.400
- I AM WHO THEY SAY I AM, RUTH.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.706
I DONE EVERY DAMN THING
THEY SAY I DONE.

21:24.684 --> 21:29.822
- MY FATHER ONCE TOLD ME...

21:29.856 --> 21:31.958
TO PUT THE PAST BEHIND YOU,

21:31.991 --> 21:34.694
YOU MUST ACCEPT THAT
YOU'VE MOVED BEYOND IT.

21:37.464 --> 21:39.366
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE,
MR. BOHANNON.

21:39.399 --> 21:42.402
THE TRUTH IS,
UNTIL YOU DO...

21:45.071 --> 21:48.408
I'M NOT SURE THE RAILROAD
CAN SAVE YOU.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.597
- THE POINT OF THIS
WAS TO GET BOHANNON OUT

22:10.630 --> 22:12.732
AND MY SON-IN-LAW IN.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.502
YOU SAID AMES WOULD GO ALONG
ONCE HE HEARD THE EVIDENCE.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.104
HE DIDN'T.
SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIX THIS?

22:18.137 --> 22:20.106
- I AM FIXING IT NOW!

22:20.139 --> 22:21.574
- IF DELANEY ISN'T RUNNING
THIS ROAD

22:21.608 --> 22:22.909
BY THE TIME GRANT IS ELECTED,

22:22.942 --> 22:24.877
WE'LL BOTH END UP
IN HUDSON PRISON.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.813
- I SWEAR TO GOD, IF YOUR FAMILY

22:26.846 --> 22:29.782
DID NOT OWN HALF
THE BOSTON WATERFRONT,

22:29.816 --> 22:32.084
YOU WOULD BE WORKING
IN A FISH SHOP!

22:32.118 --> 22:34.086
HERE!

22:34.120 --> 22:35.788
- WHAT IS THIS?

22:35.822 --> 22:37.023
- A BACKUP PLAN.

22:37.056 --> 22:41.528
AND, IF I MAY SAY,
A BRILLIANT ONE.

22:41.561 --> 22:47.534
YOUR SON-IN-LAW WILL BE CHIEF
ENGINEER BY THE END OF THE DAY,

22:47.567 --> 22:49.902
BECAUSE BOHANNON WILL RESIGN.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.971
- ARE YOU SURE BOHANNON
WON'T SIGN THIS?

22:52.004 --> 22:53.172
- [chuckles]

22:53.205 --> 22:55.442
SO SURE THAT I GUARANTEE THAT

22:55.475 --> 22:57.143
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW AFTERNOON,

22:57.176 --> 23:02.114
YOU AND I WILL ONCE AGAIN BE
SUCKLING ON THE RAILROAD'S TEAT!

23:02.148 --> 23:04.150
- WE'D BETTER BE.

23:09.922 --> 23:12.659
- [sighs]

23:12.692 --> 23:16.529
SO YOU WANT ME TO SIGN
THIS PIECE OF PAPER,

23:16.563 --> 23:17.930
DENYING THE THINGS I DONE,

23:17.964 --> 23:20.633
WHICH YOU PARDONED ME OF,

23:20.667 --> 23:23.936
SO YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE
I AIN'T DONE 'EM.

23:23.970 --> 23:27.974
AND IF I SIGN IT,
I GET TO KEEP MY JOB?

23:38.217 --> 23:41.420
KILLING AIN'T THAT EASY
TO PUT BEHIND.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.793
I DON'T EXPECT MEN LIKE THESE,

23:46.826 --> 23:48.495
WHO BOUGHT THEMSELVES
OUT OF THE DRAFT,

23:48.528 --> 23:49.696
TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, GENERAL,

23:49.729 --> 23:53.466
BUT I RECKON YOU DO.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.503
KILLING AIN'T SOMETHING
ANYONE IS BORN TO.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.974
IT'S SOMETHING WE LEARN.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.912
AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS
TO LIVE WITH IT WHEN IT'S DONE.

24:07.547 --> 24:11.183
HMM.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.521
I DONE A LOT OF KILLING,

24:14.554 --> 24:18.257
BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE WAR.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.992
MR. DURANT
AND SENATOR METCALF HERE,

24:20.026 --> 24:23.596
THEY'LL CALL ME A MURDERER
AS IT SUITS THEM.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.533
BUT NO MATTER
WHAT THEY CALL IT,

24:26.566 --> 24:30.236
IT WON'T BRING BACK THOSE MEN
OR MY FAMILY.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.644
DAMN SURE WON'T CHANGE
WHO I AM.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.278
- YOU'RE REFUSING
TO SIGN THE STATEMENT?

24:39.311 --> 24:42.715
- I WON'T SIGN IT
BECAUSE IT AIN'T TRUE.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.517
I'M A KILLER
AND A RAILROAD MAN.

24:44.551 --> 24:47.720
YOU CAN'T PICK ONE
WITHOUT CHOOSING THE OTHER.

24:47.754 --> 24:52.091
LIKE I SAID, I MAKE NO APOLOGIES
FOR MY TEMPERAMENT.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.568
- MICKEY.
- EVERYTHING OKAY, MR. BOHANNON?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.936
- I HAVE NEVER BEEN BETTER.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.838
THE GOOD STUFF.

25:05.872 --> 25:09.108
NO, FROM UNDERNEATH THE BAR.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.877
- YES, SIR, BOSS MAN, SIR.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.846
- AIN'T NOBODY'S BOSS NO MORE,
MICKEY.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.083
DURANT IS.
- THEY FIRED YOU?

25:17.116 --> 25:18.985
- I QUIT.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.620
- WHAT ABOUT THE RAILROAD?

25:20.653 --> 25:23.055
- DURANT WILL FINISH IT.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.091
SHIT, HE STARTED IT.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.063
- DID YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU FED ME THE STORY

25:31.097 --> 25:34.601
ABOUT MR. BOHANNON'S INVOLVEMENT
IN THOSE KILLINGS

25:34.634 --> 25:37.336
THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO THIS?

25:37.369 --> 25:39.572
- JUSTICE?

25:39.606 --> 25:43.009
- YOU GETTING
YOUR RAILROAD BACK.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.812
- HISTORY IS NEVER KIND
TO MEN LIKE BOHANNON.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.181
THOUGH THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH MEN LIKE ME.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.820
- SO WHAT'S LEFT
FOR A MAN LIKE YOU?

25:56.022 --> 25:59.626
- THE ONE AND ONLY THING
I EVER TRULY WANTED.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.861
[chuckles]

26:01.894 --> 26:07.199
TO BE KNOWN AS THE MAN WHO BUILT
THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.603
[chuckles]
- THAT'S ALL?

26:10.637 --> 26:12.739
- [laughs] WELL...

26:12.772 --> 26:15.775
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH,
THANK YOU.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.752
TELL ME SOMETHING,
MISS ELLISON.

26:29.388 --> 26:32.725
WHY AREN'T YOU FURTHER AHEAD?

26:32.759 --> 26:35.662
YOU ARE THE MOST
WIDELY READ JOURNALIST,

26:35.695 --> 26:38.931
MALE OR FEMALE,
IN THE COUNTRY.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

26:41.300 --> 26:45.237
- I GO WHERE THE STORY
TAKES ME.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.206
- NO.

26:47.239 --> 26:53.212
YOU DID SOMETHING
TO GET YOURSELF EXCOMMUNICATED.

26:53.245 --> 26:56.716
WHAT WAS IT?

26:56.749 --> 26:59.051
INVOLVED WITH THE WRONG MAN?

27:03.690 --> 27:07.359
- I'M HERE,
AS YOU ALREADY SEEM TO KNOW,

27:07.393 --> 27:12.331
BECAUSE OF ONE SMALL,
UNREQUITED INDISCRETION,

27:12.364 --> 27:14.400
THE SORT OF THING
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE WARRANTED

27:14.433 --> 27:17.169
AN AFTERTHOUGHT
WERE I A MAN.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.271
- HMM, WELL...

27:19.305 --> 27:23.375
I BELIEVE THAT, MY DEAR,
IS THE CRUX OF YOUR PROBLEM.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.878
HEH.

27:25.912 --> 27:30.382
I HAVE MET MISS IDA GREELEY.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.952
SHE'S VERY FETCHING.

27:34.854 --> 27:38.024
WERE YOU A MAN,
I AM SURE THAT MR. GREELEY

27:38.057 --> 27:42.261
WOULD WELCOME WHATEVER AFFECTION
YOU FELT TOWARD HIS DAUGHTER.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.000
- I WROTE A STORY,
MR. DURANT.

27:48.034 --> 27:52.872
AS A RESULT,
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.474
PERHAPS YOU COULD TELL
A STORY FOR ME NOW,

27:55.507 --> 27:58.745
THAT WOULD HASTEN MY RETURN
BACK TO NEW YORK.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.112
- TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MY RELATIONSHIP

28:00.146 --> 28:03.750
WITH MR. GREELEY, YOU MEAN?

28:03.783 --> 28:05.952
OH.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.153
WOULD THAT I COULD,
MISS ELLISON.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.089
WOULD THAT I COULD.

28:10.122 --> 28:13.092
[cheerful folk music]

28:13.125 --> 28:21.133
*

28:23.803 --> 28:25.304
- WHISKEY, PLEASE.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.474
- WE'RE CLOSED.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.409
- CLOSED?

28:32.144 --> 28:33.913
- WHATEVER SHE WANTS, MICKEY,
ON ME.

28:33.946 --> 28:35.181
- NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S FINE.

28:35.214 --> 28:38.150
- NO, NO, NO, NO,

38:10.522 --> 38:11.890

38:11.923 --> 38:13.825

38:13.859 --> 38:15.361
300,000 IN ALL.

38:15.394 --> 38:21.066
MEN, FATHERS, SONS, BROTHERS.
ALL DEAD.

38:21.099 --> 38:24.603
THANKS TO ME.

PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY,
FOR WINNING THEIR UGLY WAR
