(GROWLING)

00:16.225 --> 00:18.394
We're here tonight

00:18.395 --> 00:20.562
to kick off Camp Kikiwaka's

00:16.225 --> 00:20.561
bestest tradition,

00:20.562 --> 00:22.335
the ceremony

00:22.336 --> 00:24.107
to pick the Guardian

00:20.562 --> 00:24.106
of the Spirit Stick!

00:24.107 --> 00:25.525
(ALL GROANING)

00:26.944 --> 00:30.696
Respect the Stick, people!

00:30.697 --> 00:32.095
Or, I'll take away

00:32.095 --> 00:33.491
your bathroom privileges

00:33.492 --> 00:34.597
and the woods will

00:34.598 --> 00:35.701
be your toilet.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.996
That would be an upgrade.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.250
Our camp founder,

00:41.251 --> 00:43.502
Jedediah Swearengen,

00:38.997 --> 00:43.501
whittled this sacred Stick

00:43.502 --> 00:44.879
from an ancient pine

00:44.880 --> 00:46.255
that was struck

00:43.502 --> 00:46.254
by lightning.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.153
As was Jedediah,

00:48.154 --> 00:50.050
whose wife left him

00:46.255 --> 00:50.049
shortly thereafter.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.760
- Because he was hit
- by lightning?

00:51.763 --> 00:52.929
No, he was just

00:52.930 --> 00:54.096
emotionally distant.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.955
Since then,

00:57.956 --> 00:59.685
we've honored the Stick

00:56.223 --> 00:59.684
out of respect to the woods

00:59.685 --> 01:01.686
and its spirits.

01:01.687 --> 01:02.981
Because of this,

01:02.982 --> 01:04.272
the camp and the forest

01:01.687 --> 01:04.272
have lived in harmony.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.941
I guess the forest turns

01:05.942 --> 01:07.609
a blind eye to Gladys'

01:04.272 --> 01:07.609
daily raw sewage dump.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.990
Guys, being

01:11.991 --> 01:14.283
Guardian of the Stick

01:09.695 --> 01:14.282
gets you mad respect.

01:14.283 --> 01:15.868
But, if the Guardian

01:15.869 --> 01:17.451
loses the Stick,

01:17.452 --> 01:18.517
the wood spirits

01:18.518 --> 01:19.579
will flip out!

01:19.580 --> 01:21.686
And the Guardian's

01:21.687 --> 01:23.792
entire cabin will

01:19.580 --> 01:23.791
be cursed with bad luck!

01:23.792 --> 01:25.294
That's ridiculous.

01:25.295 --> 01:26.795
There's no such thing

01:23.792 --> 01:26.794
as bad luck.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.818
If that's true,

01:27.819 --> 01:28.839
how did I end up here?

01:30.382 --> 01:31.799
And now,

01:31.800 --> 01:32.864
we will toss the

01:32.865 --> 01:33.926
Stick up in the air,

01:33.927 --> 01:35.742

- I'm everywhere.
- Get used to it.

03:18.408 --> 03:19.824
to steal the Spirit Stick.

She does it every year so

Xander, you might wanna

03:37.552 --> 03:38.801
invest in some curtains.

03:38.802 --> 03:39.845
And a taser.

03:42.681 --> 03:43.889
Hey, Ravi,

03:43.890 --> 03:45.476
let's go on the roof

03:45.477 --> 03:47.060

03:43.890 --> 03:47.059

I'm betting she melts.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.947
While I do believe Hazel

03:57.948 --> 03:59.155
is a witch,

03:59.156 --> 04:00.720
my problem is

04:00.721 --> 04:02.284
in order to remain

03:59.156 --> 04:02.283
a Counselor in Training,

04:02.284 --> 04:03.619
I must be certified as

04:03.620 --> 04:04.952
a swim instructor.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.037
And my test is on Thursday.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.082
And you're scared

04:08.083 --> 04:09.124
of Thursdays?

04:11.168 --> 04:13.043
No, of swimming!

04:13.044 --> 04:14.837
I never learned how!

04:14.838 --> 04:16.255
And they still let you

04:16.257 --> 04:17.673
be a CIT?

04:17.673 --> 04:18.843
Well, I may have fudged

04:18.844 --> 04:20.009
the paperwork,

04:20.010 --> 04:21.574
and by that I mean

04:21.575 --> 04:23.138
I dropped fudge on

04:20.010 --> 04:23.138
the "Yes, I can swim" box.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.808
Dude, I can teach you how

04:25.809 --> 04:27.266
to swim.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.143
My abuela was a dolphin.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.292
I very much doubt

04:30.293 --> 04:31.437
that is true,

04:31.438 --> 04:33.107
but desperate times call

04:33.108 --> 04:34.775
for desperate measures.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.774
Please teach me.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.840
You got it!

04:36.841 --> 04:38.904
And don't worry,

04:34.775 --> 04:38.903
lots of people can't swim.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.198
Like babies

04:40.199 --> 04:41.490
and slightly older babies.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.526
Here's the most

05:17.527 --> 05:18.944
important thing

05:16.107 --> 05:18.943
about learning to swim,

05:18.944 --> 05:20.487
you need to find

05:20.488 --> 05:22.030
the bathing suit

05:18.944 --> 05:22.030
that makes you look hot!

05:24.074 --> 05:26.076
Okay, that's the craziest

05:26.077 --> 05:28.077
thing you've ever said.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.559
And I once heard you ask

05:29.560 --> 05:31.039
what an apple was made of.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.041
Did you really ask that?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.940
Yes, and I'll keep asking

05:35.941 --> 05:37.837
until I get an answer!

05:39.548 --> 05:41.590
I'll teach you to swim.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.135
But you should always

05:43.136 --> 05:44.678
research something

05:41.591 --> 05:44.677
before you attempt it.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.136
So, let's hit the books!

05:46.137 --> 05:47.848
No, you should hit the water,

05:47.849 --> 05:49.557
with me.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.726
Ah, I do not care

05:50.727 --> 05:51.892
who teaches me.

05:51.893 --> 05:52.957
I just need to learn

05:52.958 --> 05:54.019
by Thursday.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.876
Who are you gonna trust,

05:55.877 --> 05:57.731
Miss "I know how to read,"

05:57.732 --> 05:58.984
or your best bud

05:58.985 --> 06:00.234
in the whole wide world?

06:00.235 --> 06:01.486
Yesterday,

06:01.487 --> 06:02.736
you threw dirt in my oatmeal.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.322
I'm a complex guy!

06:06.283 --> 06:07.659
That's the last time I play

06:07.660 --> 06:09.034
basketball with a lizard.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.308
Mrs. Kipling is such

06:10.309 --> 06:11.579
a sore loser.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.956
Yeah, it's bad enough

06:12.957 --> 06:14.331
she popped our ball,

06:14.332 --> 06:15.480
she didn't have to pee

06:15.481 --> 06:16.626
in our water bottles.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.963
Guess what?

06:20.964 --> 06:22.716
- I gave the Spirit Stick
- to Xander!

06:22.719 --> 06:24.072
(BOTH GASPING)

06:24.073 --> 06:25.426
Oh, no, you didn't!

06:25.427 --> 06:26.721
Giving the Stick away means

06:26.722 --> 06:28.012
you've failed as Guardian!

06:28.013 --> 06:29.973
Now, all of Woodchuck cabin

06:29.974 --> 06:31.933
is gonna be knee deep

06:28.013 --> 06:31.932
in bad luck!

06:31.933 --> 06:33.434
That's not gonna happen.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.187
The only thing we're

06:35.188 --> 06:36.938
knee deep in around here

06:33.435 --> 06:36.938
is pond scum and body odor.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.859
And hormones.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.777

06:47.574 --> 06:50.473
Great, Emma, you give away

06:50.474 --> 06:53.371
the Stick and suddenly I can

06:47.574 --> 06:53.370
guide Santa's sleigh at night.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.811
Look, Xander wants to be

06:54.812 --> 06:56.248
the Guardian of the Stick,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.168
- and I wanna be
- the Guardian of Xander.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.463
Oh, I see how it is.

07:01.464 --> 07:02.839
Sticks before chicks.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.448
You guys

07:07.449 --> 07:09.095
are just being superstitious.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.094
Bad luck is not real.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.262
ALL: Hey!

07:10.263 --> 07:11.347
Oh!

07:11.348 --> 07:13.015
(GROANS)

07:13.016 --> 07:14.768
- That was just - a coincidence!
- (BACK CRACKING)

07:14.771 --> 07:16.311
- A really painful
- coincidence.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.816
So, let's review

07:21.817 --> 07:23.818
the assigned reading

07:19.814 --> 07:23.817
about swimming.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.049
The ideal rate

07:25.050 --> 07:26.278
of strokes per minute is?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.155
Oh! Uh, 60!

07:28.156 --> 07:29.596
Quick question, does

07:29.597 --> 07:31.033
frantically flailing your arms

07:31.034 --> 07:32.577
to flag down a lifeguard,

07:32.578 --> 07:34.119
count as a stroke?

07:34.120 --> 07:36.040
You'll be fine, Ravi.

07:36.041 --> 07:37.958
And, no, it does not count.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.211
- Here's something
- that will help you.

07:41.214 --> 07:43.420
Remember this mnemonic device,

07:43.421 --> 07:45.340
breathe, acclimate,

07:45.341 --> 07:47.257
relax, focus.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.719
Oh, so, the acronym would

07:48.720 --> 07:50.178
be... BARF?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.390
Exactly.

07:53.391 --> 07:54.474
It's crude, but memorable.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.498
Now, before you even get

07:57.499 --> 07:58.852
in the water,

07:58.853 --> 08:00.168
you should be aware

08:00.169 --> 08:01.481
of the native flora

07:58.853 --> 08:01.480
and fauna of the lake.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.441
- Most notably,
- the Northern Water Snakes.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.193
Snakes?

08:06.194 --> 08:07.780
Don't worry,

08:07.781 --> 08:09.364
they'll only bite you

08:06.194 --> 08:09.363
if you're swimming near them.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.199
- How will I know
- if I am near them?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
If they bite you.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.996
Okay, Tiffany,

08:15.997 --> 08:17.579
my turn to teach Ravi.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.041
No! We're making

08:19.042 --> 08:20.499
progress here.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.043
Please. The closest he's come

08:22.044 --> 08:23.585
to getting wet

08:23.586 --> 08:25.255
is when he licked his finger

08:25.256 --> 08:26.923
to turn the next page.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.927
He's not ready

08:30.928 --> 08:33.304
to get in the water yet.

08:28.550 --> 08:33.303
We have to take baby steps.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.097
Exactly!

08:35.099 --> 08:36.890
Which is why I got this.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.226
Well, this is embarrassing.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.688
On the other hand,

08:40.688 --> 08:42.145
my swimming test is tomorrow.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.190
Quick question,

08:43.191 --> 08:44.232
which is the shallow end?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.610
Just jump in, big guy.

08:56.286 --> 08:57.953
Ha!

08:57.954 --> 09:00.080
This is not so bad.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.082
(CHUCKLES) Wait, wait,

09:01.083 --> 09:02.083
what is that?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.087
(SCREAMING)

09:05.088 --> 09:06.754
The snakes are biting!

09:06.755 --> 09:09.966
(SCREAMING)

09:11.176 --> 09:13.219
(LAUGHS) That's just the hose!

09:16.222 --> 09:17.848
Hey, Emma,

09:17.849 --> 09:19.018
I saw you get wiped out

09:19.019 --> 09:20.184
by that wakeboard.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.083
When I replay it in my head,

09:22.084 --> 09:23.980
it just gets better

09:20.185 --> 09:23.979
and better!

09:23.980 --> 09:27.191
(LAUGHING)

09:27.192 --> 09:28.589
We need to get

09:28.590 --> 09:29.986
that Spirit Stick

09:27.192 --> 09:29.985
back from Xander

09:29.986 --> 09:31.634
before any more wakeboards

09:31.635 --> 09:33.281
take out the rest

09:29.986 --> 09:33.280
of us Woodchucks.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.763
Yes, and before my pimple

09:35.764 --> 09:38.244
erupts like Mount Vesuvius

09:33.281 --> 09:38.243
and wipes out half the camp.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.767
(SCOFFS) For the last time,

09:39.768 --> 09:41.289
there's no such thing

09:38.244 --> 09:41.289
as bad luck.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.584
(GASPING)

09:47.879 --> 09:48.880
(GASPING)

09:53.218 --> 09:55.012
Oh, I should've read

09:55.013 --> 09:56.805
this sign before I took it

09:53.218 --> 09:56.805
off the bench.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.809
Okay, the bad luck is real!

10:00.810 --> 10:02.352
Let's get that Stick back!

10:05.855 --> 10:07.649
Ooh, if you see

10:07.650 --> 10:09.442
that cute guy Duke

10:05.855 --> 10:09.441
from Eagle cabin,

10:09.442 --> 10:11.402
- just sit down
- and play it cool.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.573
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

10:16.574 --> 10:18.367
Xander, it's Emma!

10:18.368 --> 10:20.203
- Are you there?
- Oh, Emma!

10:20.206 --> 10:21.308
Hey, thank you so much

10:21.309 --> 10:22.413
for the... (SCREAMS)

10:24.207 --> 10:25.667
- That must have been
- one big bird.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.607
Right, it's blueberry

10:28.608 --> 10:30.295
bird poop.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.382
Anyway, thanks so much

10:32.383 --> 10:34.467
for giving me this.

10:30.296 --> 10:34.466
Being the Guardian is awesome.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.573
Do I look taller?

10:35.574 --> 10:36.678
I feel taller.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.555
Yeah, about the Stick...

10:39.556 --> 10:40.932
- (THUDS)
- Ow!

10:40.935 --> 10:42.224
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

10:42.225 --> 10:43.519
I was trying to cover.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.810
No, no, we're one.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.354
Stop it, stop it,

10:46.355 --> 10:47.896
you're walking too fast.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.816
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey!

10:49.819 --> 10:51.191
What happened to you guys?

10:51.192 --> 10:52.901
Bad luck happened,

10:52.902 --> 10:54.279
because Emma gave you

10:54.280 --> 10:55.655
the Spirit Stick,

10:52.902 --> 10:55.654
we got bench butt!

10:55.655 --> 10:56.970
And my face looks

10:56.971 --> 10:58.282
like pepperoni pizza!

10:58.283 --> 11:00.450
I said I'd do the talking!

11:00.451 --> 11:01.994
(SIGHING) Xander,

11:01.995 --> 11:03.246
we would really appreciate it

11:03.247 --> 11:04.497
if you could give

11:01.995 --> 11:04.496
the Stick back.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.542
But you gave it to me.

11:06.543 --> 11:08.585
With a nice note. Did you

11:04.497 --> 11:08.584
not mean all those XO's?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.608
(GASPING) Of course I did.

11:10.609 --> 11:12.629
I'll get you something else.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.466
Do you like baseball?

11:14.467 --> 11:16.301
I'll buy you season tickets.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.300
Or a team!

11:16.301 --> 11:18.596
You realize if I give

11:18.597 --> 11:20.889
the Spirit Stick back, then

11:16.301 --> 11:20.888
my cabin will have bad luck?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.411
Yes! So, we're agreed.

11:22.412 --> 11:23.933
How do you feel

11:20.889 --> 11:23.932
about the Yankees?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.893
(INDISTINCT ARGUING)

11:25.894 --> 11:27.395
- XANDER: No way!
- For absolutely nothing.

11:27.398 --> 11:28.562
(SCREAMING)

11:28.563 --> 11:30.689
(GROANING)

11:30.690 --> 11:32.650
- You know we have
- to move in sync!

11:32.653 --> 11:33.965
Didn't you learn nothing

11:33.966 --> 11:35.278
in the bathroom?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.325
Look, I am swimming.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.619
I think he's improving.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.746
Remember to synchronize your

11:44.747 --> 11:45.871
arms and legs

11:45.872 --> 11:47.539
like the book said. (CHUCKLES)

11:47.540 --> 11:49.500
- Your books
- were no help at all!

11:49.503 --> 11:50.731
That's why my motto

11:50.732 --> 11:51.961
is, "Never read."

11:53.463 --> 11:54.881
That explains

11:54.882 --> 11:56.299
so much about you.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.427
JORGE: Hey!

12:00.428 --> 12:01.471
I know how to get him

12:01.472 --> 12:02.512
in the water.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.786
But we might have to do

12:03.787 --> 12:05.057
something a little loco.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.227
(GASPING) You mean,

12:07.228 --> 12:09.395
like sneaking out of the camp

12:05.058 --> 12:09.394
and going to the town library?

12:09.395 --> 12:11.189
I've been mapping that out

12:11.190 --> 12:12.982
since day one.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.981
No.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.067
We need to get physical.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.527
I don't like you like that.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.260
I meant, if I pretended

12:19.261 --> 12:20.489
to get a cramp,

12:20.490 --> 12:21.804
Ravi will jump in,

12:21.805 --> 12:23.116
and swim to save me!

12:23.117 --> 12:25.245
That is a horrible idea!

12:25.246 --> 12:27.371
I do not condone lying...

12:27.372 --> 12:29.437
Unless it's doctoring your age

12:29.438 --> 12:31.501
to get into the high school

12:27.372 --> 12:31.500
spelling bee.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.294
- Stand back.
- You're in the splash zone.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.176
Help!

12:41.177 --> 12:42.469
Ravi!

12:42.470 --> 12:43.931
Do not worry, Jorge,

12:43.932 --> 12:45.390
I will save you!

12:48.226 --> 12:49.269
(THUDS)

12:49.270 --> 12:50.310
Ouch!

12:50.311 --> 12:51.312
(GROANING)

12:53.231 --> 12:55.108
Good afternoon, ladies.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.818
Don't worry, I'm okay.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.779
I am not. Could you

12:59.780 --> 13:01.739
possibly paddle me over

12:57.819 --> 13:01.739
to the infirmary?

13:05.576 --> 13:07.183
Xander's gonna be back soon.

13:07.184 --> 13:08.788
We've got to find

13:05.576 --> 13:08.787
the Spirit Stick!

13:08.788 --> 13:10.352
Remember, they can't

13:10.353 --> 13:11.916
know we were here.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.916
So, don't disturb anything.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.508
What? Jorge's a slob.

13:19.509 --> 13:21.426
If anything,

13:17.588 --> 13:21.426
I'm making it look nicer.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.763
- Hey, I think
- I found a hiding place!

13:36.482 --> 13:38.338
Oh, please, please let these

13:38.339 --> 13:40.193
not be Xander's.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.426
Argh! Where is

13:42.427 --> 13:44.657
that stupid Spirit Stick?

13:40.194 --> 13:44.656
We've looked everywhere!

13:44.657 --> 13:46.117
- (DOOR UNLOCKING)
- (GASPING) Hide!

- (CHUCKLES) You know I can
- see you all, right?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.714
Heya, slugger...

14:01.174 --> 14:02.947
Hey... You're trying

14:02.948 --> 14:04.718
to steal the Spirit Stick.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.367
(SCOFFS) Well, we wouldn't

14:06.368 --> 14:08.014
have to, if you'd given

14:04.719 --> 14:08.013
it back like a gentleman.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.620
It was a gift!

14:09.621 --> 14:11.225
What kind of person asks

14:08.014 --> 14:11.224
for a gift back?

14:11.225 --> 14:12.289
Someone whose tush

14:12.290 --> 14:13.352
is full of splinters!

14:14.520 --> 14:16.002
Meanwhile,

14:16.003 --> 14:17.481
we haven't found it.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.380
Although, we found

14:19.381 --> 14:21.277
a lot of weird stuff

14:17.482 --> 14:21.276
in that hole in the wall.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.945
- You did?
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

14:22.948 --> 14:24.488
Yeah, that stuff's Jorge's!

14:24.489 --> 14:26.531
Oh, thank goodness.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.617
Mmm-hmm.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.622
We even checked

14:31.623 --> 14:33.498
Jorge's dirty laundry.

14:29.744 --> 14:33.498
I can never unsmell that.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.751
But I hid it in his laundry.

14:36.752 --> 14:37.960
It has to be there.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.506
It's not here!

14:42.507 --> 14:44.280
Well, if we didn't find it,

14:44.281 --> 14:46.052
and you didn't move it,

14:42.507 --> 14:46.052
then who has it?

14:47.553 --> 14:48.784
ALL: Hazel!

14:48.785 --> 14:50.013
Duke!

14:50.014 --> 14:51.370
Sorry, I just can't get him

14:51.371 --> 14:52.725
out of my mind.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.061
I'm gonna get that Stick!

14:56.062 --> 14:57.605
- No way!
- LOU: Get him!

14:57.608 --> 14:58.981
(SHRIEKING)

15:01.692 --> 15:03.194
I've had dreams like this,

15:03.195 --> 15:04.695
but I was much happier.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.614
Hey!

15:06.615 --> 15:08.949
Get off my man!

15:08.950 --> 15:09.972
I don't want him.

15:09.973 --> 15:10.992
You can have him.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.661
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.394
Don't just give him away.

15:14.395 --> 15:16.124
Trade him for the

15:12.662 --> 15:16.123
Spirit Stick!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.646
If I had the Stick,

15:17.647 --> 15:19.168
I wouldn't keep it

15:16.124 --> 15:19.167
a secret.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.338
I'd be waving it

15:21.339 --> 15:23.506
in front of your face going,

15:19.168 --> 15:23.505
"Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah."

15:23.506 --> 15:26.843
Wow, I thought she was

15:26.844 --> 15:30.179
annoying before

15:23.506 --> 15:30.178
the "Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah."

15:30.179 --> 15:31.410
Well, if none of us has

15:31.411 --> 15:32.640
the Stick, then we better

15:30.179 --> 15:32.639
figure out where it is,

15:32.640 --> 15:33.892
or we are in a world

15:33.893 --> 15:35.142
of trouble.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.686
What happens if the Spirit

15:36.687 --> 15:38.228
Stick is completely lost?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.147
The entire camp gets bad luck.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.275
The last time

15:42.276 --> 15:44.402
it happened was 1958.

15:40.148 --> 15:44.401
Poison ivy got into the food.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.196
The kids itched so bad

15:46.197 --> 15:47.989
they had to eat sandpaper

15:44.402 --> 15:47.989
to scratch their insides.

So, if we can't find

15:52.391 --> 15:54.162

15:50.616 --> 15:54.161
we're all cursed!

Quick question, where's

15:58.271 --> 15:59.500
the nearest bus stop?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.740
I should be the one

16:09.741 --> 16:11.679
to talk to him.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.678
He looks up to me.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.911
You mean, down at you.

On account of you

16:21.690 --> 16:23.815
please do not fight.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.692
I know I let you both down.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.924
I'm not the Michael Phelps

16:26.925 --> 16:28.153
you thought I would be.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.864
Ravi, the only person

16:29.865 --> 16:31.574
you're letting down

16:28.154 --> 16:31.574
is yourself.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.286
Wow, that was deep!

16:37.288 --> 16:39.395
As your CIT,

16:39.396 --> 16:41.501
I should be teaching you,

16:37.288 --> 16:41.501
not the other way around.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.483
I am a failure

16:43.484 --> 16:44.504
on so many levels.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.755
You are not!

16:46.756 --> 16:48.237
Ravi, you know everything

16:48.238 --> 16:49.716
you need to know to swim.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.344
- You just have
- to jump in the water.

16:51.347 --> 16:52.574
And you almost did when

16:52.575 --> 16:53.803
you tried to save Jorge.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.307
But instead I landed

16:56.308 --> 16:58.809
in a canoe, broke one oar,

16:53.804 --> 16:58.808
and at least two ribs.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.269
Neither of which were mine.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.648
- Dude, you have
- to believe in yourself.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.880
Again, that was super deep.

17:06.881 --> 17:08.569
I am on fire!

17:11.071 --> 17:12.656
Perhaps you are right!

17:12.656 --> 17:14.054
I will do my darndest

17:14.055 --> 17:15.450
to pass that swimming test!

17:15.451 --> 17:16.557
Great! Now go out there

17:16.558 --> 17:17.661
and BARF.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.018
I feel confident

17:19.019 --> 17:20.373
that will happen

17:17.662 --> 17:20.373
one way or another.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.416
Did you find the Spirit Stick?

17:24.417 --> 17:26.108
No, just a horde of fire ants.

Now, the bad luck is biting.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.529

I'll imagine...

(THUNDER CRASHING)

17:33.219 --> 17:35.409
We came up empty-handed, too.

Meese? Mice? Nope.

17:50.091 --> 17:51.320
we lost the Stick

17:48.859 --> 17:51.319
and they are peeved!

17:51.320 --> 17:52.489
They're gonna have

17:52.490 --> 17:53.655
to shut down the camp.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.179
I never should've given

17:55.180 --> 17:56.701
the Stick away.

This is all my fault.

Uh, well, technically

well, Hazel.

Great wood spirits,

21:22.948 --> 21:25.200
didn't work!

to keep the Stick
