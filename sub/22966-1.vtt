00:22.089 --> 00:25.457
I just love this time of year,

00:25.493 --> 00:28.360
and I love it even more
shopping at Maven

00:28.396 --> 00:32.965
because the prices are so low,
it's like every day is Christmas!

00:35.536 --> 00:38.237
Good? Wanna see
anything else?

00:38.272 --> 00:40.239
No, no,
I think that's okay.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.976
Next?
Right this way.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.353
- Charlotte?
- Yes?

00:54.388 --> 00:57.122
Sorry, different
Charlotte.

00:57.158 --> 01:00.192
Right.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.480
Every day is Christmas!

01:21.515 --> 01:24.516
Every <i> day</i> is Christmas.

01:24.552 --> 01:28.120
Every day is Christmas!

01:31.992 --> 01:34.126
You know what? I've had
a lot of first days.

01:34.161 --> 01:38.130
I would actually like a second.
Thank you.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.740
Hey, Mom!

01:48.776 --> 01:51.710
Yeah, actually just got out
of an audition.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.046
I know I'm not supposed to ask
you this, but how did it go?

01:54.081 --> 01:56.815
Well, we'll see. And just
as a rule of thumb,

01:56.851 --> 01:59.384
you can always ask
how it went, just never...

01:59.420 --> 02:01.186
"Did you get the part?"

02:01.222 --> 02:04.256
So, how was your Thanksgiving?

02:07.194 --> 02:10.162
when your cereal commercial is
gonna air again, and Grandma

02:10.197 --> 02:13.999
wants me to tell you that
Brad Pitt is single. Again.

02:14.034 --> 02:18.203
Well, I'll be sure to put
his number in my speed dial.

02:18.239 --> 02:22.174
Mom, I'm sorry I didn't make it home
for Thanksgiving. I know, sweetie,

02:22.209 --> 02:24.409
but like you keep saying,

02:24.445 --> 02:26.845
you're just one audition away
from the big one.

02:26.881 --> 02:31.183
Thanks, Mom.

02:31.218 --> 02:34.353
And maybe you'll be able to
come home for Christmas, right?

02:36.223 --> 02:38.924
Well, a girl can hope, right?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.160
Anyway, right now I have
to go meet Rachel, though.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.429
She's in town for the holiday.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.366
I always liked that girl. Such
a good head on her shoulders,

02:47.401 --> 02:49.735
very... pragmatic.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.871
Right, and who doesn't love
a hopeless pragmatic?

02:52.907 --> 02:56.375
OK, I love you, hon.

02:56.410 --> 02:59.211
OK, bye.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.313
Hey, have you seen
the remote?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.049
Should be
on the coffee table.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.252
'K, found it!

03:07.288 --> 03:12.791
<i>Julian Walker</i>
<i>stars in</i> Thick or Thin.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.394
<i>Tune in tonight at 8 o'clock.</i>

03:21.001 --> 03:23.235
<i>Stop!</i>

03:23.270 --> 03:25.604
I cannot believe
you watch this.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.940
It is so overrated.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.909
You're joking, right?
I love <i> Thick or Thin.</i>

03:30.945 --> 03:33.312
Julian Walker sure is
easy on the eyes.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.214
Not so easy
on the ears.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.183
They should give him a knife,
the way he chews that scenery.

03:38.219 --> 03:42.821
Wait, didn't you take an acting
class with him back in the day?

03:42.856 --> 03:46.592
Back in the day? Thanks.
It wasn't that long ago.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.127
Actually it was
an acting workshop,

03:49.163 --> 03:51.997
which is sort of a place
where actors gather

03:52.032 --> 03:55.434
and work out. Did you work
out with anyone else famous?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.603
You know what?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.871
Maybe you should stop watching
these boring reruns

03:59.907 --> 04:02.274
and get out the rest
of the Christmas decorations.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.409
Bah...

04:04.445 --> 04:07.212
humbug!
Great.

04:07.248 --> 04:10.182
- Bye!
- Bye!

04:17.324 --> 04:19.858
Hey! Hi!

04:22.563 --> 04:26.064
- Hey!
- You're a sight for sore eyes!

04:26.100 --> 04:29.635
It's so nice to see you.
How's it going?

04:29.670 --> 04:34.206
It feels like 100 years
between drinks.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.341
Speaking of, how's the eggnog?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.477
- It was perfect.
- So,

04:38.512 --> 04:42.047
you didn't come home again this
year for Thanksgiving. No,

04:42.082 --> 04:45.217
my roommate and I had a Friendsgiving,
you know, everyone brings

04:45.252 --> 04:47.219
a special dish...
I know, silly.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.821
I'm the one who started those for
us back in college, remember?

04:49.857 --> 04:52.190
Gosh, how quickly
time flies.

04:52.226 --> 04:56.361
Alright, I know you must
loathe the question,

04:56.397 --> 04:58.664
but how is it going?

04:58.699 --> 05:02.067
Well, I am up for
a big commercial.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.335
That's good!

05:03.370 --> 05:06.171
And? You're happy?

05:06.206 --> 05:10.008
I choose to believe happiness
is a journey, not a destination.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.944
You are still collecting
all those corny sayings.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.381
Don't make fun. They keep me
believing anything is possible.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.351
Even if lately I feel like I'm
spinning my wheels waiting

05:19.386 --> 05:21.586
to become the next big whatever.
Don't say that!

05:21.622 --> 05:25.590
Weren't you this close to landing the
lead in <i> Thick or Thin</i> a few years back?

05:25.626 --> 05:28.193
The big fish that got
away, don't remind me.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.929
I was so confident,
and then they paired me

05:30.964 --> 05:33.365
with the one and only
Julian Walker.

05:33.400 --> 05:37.936
I can't imagine it's easy putting yourself out
there all the time. The ups, the downs...

05:37.971 --> 05:40.305
Yeah, the constant
cloud of rejection

05:40.341 --> 05:43.542
mixed with the occasional rays
of hope and sunshine.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.712
Well, then maybe
it's time for a change.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.115
OK, I wasn't gonna
mention this, but...

05:50.150 --> 05:53.285
they're looking for a new
coordinator in employee events

05:53.320 --> 05:56.955
at my company. Please!
I am so not qualified.

05:56.990 --> 06:01.727
Says who? You know, the last woman in the
job, she actually had a degree in theatre.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.395
- Seriously?
- Yes!

06:03.430 --> 06:07.065
Face it, Charlotte, acting is
just a different form of sales

06:07.101 --> 06:09.735
or public relations.
I suppose. And you,

06:09.770 --> 06:13.004
with your boundless energy? You're a
natural born corporate cheerleader.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.307
- You really think so?
- Totally.

06:15.342 --> 06:19.244
And just think of it...
Terrific salary, with benefits,

06:19.279 --> 06:22.347
and you get to be
in Chicago with me!

06:22.383 --> 06:24.483
I mean...

06:24.518 --> 06:27.419
Wouldn't that be fun? OK.

06:27.454 --> 06:32.357
OK, you don't have to decide this
minute. Just... think about it.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.860
Please?
I'm thinking...

06:34.895 --> 06:37.996
I need to get to work
and put a pin in this reunion.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.432
I'll take that
as a maybe.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.168
OK.

06:43.203 --> 06:46.271
It was so good
to see you, Rachel.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.773
It was. You too.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.442
OK, we'll talk soon?
Yes, please.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.444
- Alright, bye.
- Bye.

06:52.479 --> 06:56.448
- I love you.
- Love you.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.483
Livin' the dream.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.395
Don't you read that same book
every Christmas?

07:10.431 --> 07:14.833
Yep. I consider <i> Scrooge</i>
a personal literary hero.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.469
- Is that so?
- Absolutely.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.474
Table for one?
Thanks,

07:22.509 --> 07:25.310
but I'm looking to take it to
go. I'm heading for a potluck

07:25.345 --> 07:27.979
and I've got to bring
the dessert.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.148
Any recommendations?
Absolutely.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.318
Yeah, the ginger spice pumpkin
bread, always a solid choice.

07:33.353 --> 07:37.389
The peppermint cupcakes,
to die for. Or to diet for.

07:37.424 --> 07:41.092
I think I'll
take a half dozen of both.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.494
Hey, like it.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.996
Gary, can you help me with
a takeout order? Yep.

07:45.032 --> 07:49.334
Half a dozen of the ginger spice pumpkin bread
and a half dozen of peppermint cupcakes.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.503
- Got it.
- Here you go. -.

07:51.538 --> 07:54.573
- Thanks, Charlotte.
- How did you know my name?

07:54.608 --> 07:57.342
Right.

07:57.377 --> 08:01.613
- Sid. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Sid.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.116
And a potluck? That sounds
fun. What's the occasion?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.285
I'm working on a new
production at the Grand.

08:07.321 --> 08:10.255
It's their annual Christmas dinner.
Is that so?

08:10.290 --> 08:13.024
Well, Charlotte is quite the actress.
That I am.

08:13.060 --> 08:16.027
And tonight, I will be
acting as your waitress.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.130
Have you been in any theatre
productions I might have seen?

08:19.166 --> 08:21.500
No, no. I mean,
not since college.

08:21.535 --> 08:25.036
I've done some commercials
and some guest roles. Nice.

08:25.072 --> 08:29.040
But if you ever get the chance,
there's nothing like theatre.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.543
True. You can't beat the
thrill of a live audience.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.544
OK, I'm sorry,

08:33.580 --> 08:36.548
when were you in front of a live
audience? Third grade production

08:36.582 --> 08:40.552
of the Christmas nativity.
I played one of the Wise Men.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.822
Yeah, you did.
OK, here you go.

08:43.857 --> 08:48.059
- Hope to see you around.
- And I'm looking forward to being seen.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.695
- Good night.
Good night.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.966
You ever thought about trying out for the
live theatre? I bet you'd be great on stage.

08:55.002 --> 08:58.770
My friend is trying to convince me to
take this party planning job in Chicago.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.840
- And?
- And I am considering it.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.509
I can't keep living
paycheck to paycheck.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.811
I'm getting kind of tired
of chasing the dream.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.347
I've seen this before.
You're just in a funk.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.784
And it's like you're always telling
me... you're only one audition away...

09:12.819 --> 09:16.521
- From the big one. I know.
- That's my Charlotte.

09:18.492 --> 09:22.861
Mind closing the café tonight? My wife is
hoping that we'll put up the Christmas tree.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.797
Of course. Go have fun.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.333
- Thanks.
- Bye.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.751
<i>To the Grand
repertory company.</i>

09:46.787 --> 09:49.621
I wanna thank each one of you
for welcoming me back.

09:49.656 --> 09:54.526
It means... Who's that? 
And enter dessert!

09:54.561 --> 09:56.895
Dessert, fashionably late.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.131
As always, Sid,
your timing is impeccable.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.702
Everybody, this is Sid, our
set designer.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.739
I'm so glad you decided
to join us again this year.

10:07.774 --> 10:12.177
I wouldn't miss working with the
finest seamstress in theatre.

10:12.212 --> 10:16.214
- Flattery will get you everywhere.
- Sid, hey!!

10:16.249 --> 10:19.517
How you doin', buddy? The
real star of this production.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.787
America's favorite awardwinning TV star.
Come on.

10:22.823 --> 10:26.324
- How's the series going?
- It was great, we did 5 years. Onto the next, right?

10:26.360 --> 10:29.928
I told Sid to check out the
entire <i>Thick and Thin</i> experience.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.964
OK, I'm sure you did.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.335
Well, you know me and TV. I have to
confess, I didn't see a single episode.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.738
You know who you're starting
to sound like? My dad.

10:39.773 --> 10:43.008
Yeah, he didn't like TV much.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.343
And even before he became
the artistic director

10:45.379 --> 10:47.679
of this theatre.
This place was his home.

10:47.714 --> 10:51.282
But he did have a little
disdain for TV actors.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.518
Hey now, don't say that.
Your father would be very proud

10:53.553 --> 10:55.687
of all of your accomplishments,
especially the fact

10:55.722 --> 10:58.256
that you're running the company
and directing our Christmas show

10:58.291 --> 11:00.592
this year.
The prodigal son following

11:00.627 --> 11:03.294
in his father's footsteps. OK,
let's not get ahead of ourselves.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.764
Those are huge shoes
to fill, OK?

11:05.799 --> 11:09.134
You know,<i> A Christmas Carol</i>
is a big chestnut to crack.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.736
Particularly for
a first-time director.

11:11.772 --> 11:15.874
You're nervous?
Come on. Me?

11:15.909 --> 11:19.911
I'm a TV star. Not to mention I was
nominated for People's Choice awards.

11:19.946 --> 11:22.313
Nervous? Come on,
that's for kids!

11:22.349 --> 11:24.315
No, I'm...

11:24.351 --> 11:27.285
utterly terrified.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.156
OK, there's a glass here
that's empty.

11:58.185 --> 12:02.353
- What? You started decorating without me?
- Sorry,

12:02.389 --> 12:05.657
we sort of got carried away.
This is my friend Liz.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.525
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:07.561 --> 12:11.763
What started out as a decoration
party turned into a celebration.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.598
Liz just booked
another acting gig.

12:13.633 --> 12:17.035
She's killing it right now.
No, it's...

12:17.070 --> 12:19.104
just a silly commercial.
Go on, Liz,

12:19.139 --> 12:21.206
do the line from it.
No! It's so good!

12:21.241 --> 12:24.109
- No!
- Yes, do it! - OK. OK.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.377
Shopping at Maven's,

12:26.413 --> 12:28.780
it's like every day
is Christmas!

12:28.815 --> 12:30.815
So good!

12:30.851 --> 12:32.951
It's amazing.

12:32.986 --> 12:36.121
We're gonna go celebrate, have a glass
of champagne. Do you wanna come with?

12:36.156 --> 12:39.624
No. Um, no, I mean, I'm...

12:39.659 --> 12:42.193
I am just exhausted.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.963
But you guys should go.
Yeah, you should celebrate.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.166
- OK.
- Yeah.

12:48.201 --> 12:51.836
OK, Rach, I'm ready to take a stab
at that job if it's still available.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.005
Really? Are you serious?

12:54.040 --> 12:56.007
Serious as a broken dream.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.743
Yay, Charlotte!
That's amazing!

13:01.915 --> 13:04.115
<i>Julian,</i>

13:04.151 --> 13:07.118
have you thought about the design
aesthetic for this year's production?

13:07.154 --> 13:10.088
We could save a lot of money by
repurposing the set from last year.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.724
- Costumes as well.
- Yeah, see, right there,

13:12.759 --> 13:15.126
that's my worry. That's the same
thing that's happening all the time.

13:15.162 --> 13:18.229
The tried and true. People see that
millions and millions of times, guys.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.865
Maybe, there is
a comfort in familiarity.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.535
Besides, we don't have time
to start something new.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.770
Look, I know
that's comforting,

13:25.806 --> 13:28.573
but we need to do something
inspiring, not comforting.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.843
Something exciting, something
refreshing, something real.

13:31.878 --> 13:35.680
Something from, hey... here, OK?

13:37.918 --> 13:40.852
Do you wanna know why
I came back here?

13:40.887 --> 13:43.855
Because I believe
in everybody at this table.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.924
I believe in your talent

13:45.959 --> 13:49.861
and I believe if we work together
we can create something amazing.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.897
Let's give
our audience

13:52.933 --> 13:55.700
a Scrooge they'll
never forget.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.538
Who's with me?

14:00.574 --> 14:02.440
I'm in.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.276
- Me too.
- Let's do it.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.112
To the Grand Company players.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.914
Let's create something

14:09.950 --> 14:12.483
beautiful.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.164
<i>Table for two?</i>

14:26.199 --> 14:28.600
Absolutely.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.172
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thank you. - Appreciate it, thanks.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.845
You've got two live ones

14:40.881 --> 14:44.749
in your station.
OK. Happy holidays.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.652
Happy holidays!

14:47.687 --> 14:49.921
Julian?

14:49.956 --> 14:52.257
Julian Walker?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.959
Hello,
Charlotte.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.664
You know, I thought
that was you.

14:59.699 --> 15:03.635
I just saw you
over here from my table

15:03.670 --> 15:06.938
over there and I just
came over to say hello.

15:06.973 --> 15:11.109
- Hello. This is my friend Franny.
- Nice to meet you.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.978
Charlotte and I auditioned
for <i> Thick and Thin</i> together

15:14.014 --> 15:16.447
and we did some workshops back in the day
when we were starting out, didn't we?

15:16.483 --> 15:19.550
- Yeah, good times, good times.
- Yeah.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.854
Rock solid actress. Fantastic.
Well,

15:22.889 --> 15:25.990
you are too kind.
I don't wanna keep you.

15:26.026 --> 15:29.994
I just, you know, was coming to say hello,
so I'm gonna... Excuse me. Charlotte,

15:30.030 --> 15:32.030
I need you to take
these to table 7.

15:32.065 --> 15:36.334
A party of 9, I need to set up for it.
Um, OK, I'll do it.

15:36.369 --> 15:40.338
Anyway, well,
I better get going.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.908
I'm just here, you know,
researching a part.

15:43.944 --> 15:45.476
Right.

15:45.512 --> 15:49.180
A part I seem born to play
for the rest of my life.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.889
Hey, Charlotte.
I just got back to Chicago.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.993
Just four more blocks, sir.
Thanks. No problem.

16:06.700 --> 16:10.001
OK, I like the sound of that,
but what exactly does it mean?

16:13.340 --> 16:15.907
three jobs sometimes to pursue
your dream of being an actress.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.343
She actually considered
that an asset?

16:18.378 --> 16:20.011
Definitely.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.847
Shows her you're goal-oriented.
Now you just have to show her

16:22.882 --> 16:26.851
In a phone interview?

16:26.886 --> 16:29.587
No. My boss is coming
to New York

16:29.622 --> 16:31.923
and plans on seeing if
everything I've said about you

16:34.494 --> 16:38.029
OK. I'm scared.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.797
Just be you.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.700
That's all I sold and that's
all you need to deliver.

16:42.736 --> 16:45.870
OK, I will be the best version
of me that I can muster,

16:45.905 --> 16:48.139
and if that doesn't work,
I'll fake it.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.142
OK. Bye!

16:51.177 --> 16:53.978
- Bye.
- What was that about?

16:54.014 --> 16:57.382
I have a job interview
next week.

16:57.417 --> 17:01.085
- What's the part?
- It's not an acting gig.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.154
It's a real job.

17:03.189 --> 17:07.090
Like, in the real world. Uhoh.
I heard about those ones.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.228
Entirely
overrated.

17:15.435 --> 17:19.237
So, Gary, I'm gonna need to keep my
schedule loose over the next week,

17:19.271 --> 17:23.074
but I should know about the interview in
a couple days. Got it. What's the part?

17:23.108 --> 17:25.576
Party planning coordinator.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.112
You're not seriously considering
taking a job, are you?

17:28.147 --> 17:31.082
I am seriously considering all
of my options at this point,

17:31.117 --> 17:33.051
and this is most
certainly an option.

17:33.086 --> 17:37.021
- Fair enough.
- And look, if fate's plan is for me to stay in this town,

17:37.057 --> 17:40.091
it needs to give me a sign. And
that sign needs to have, like,

17:40.126 --> 17:42.927
big flashing lights
and a sparkler on it.

17:42.962 --> 17:46.864
But until then...
happy holidays.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.201
Happy holidays.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.953
Sorry.

18:08.988 --> 18:12.023
Hey, do me a favor, OK?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.030
Looks great, guys, I love it!

18:19.065 --> 18:22.900
We get a lot of inquiries,
I'll give you that.

18:24.571 --> 18:27.138
No, no, no, hey,
I'll get that. No, no.

18:27.173 --> 18:30.475
- I'm not exactly sure what to expect.
- What to expect, Naomi,

18:30.510 --> 18:34.946
is that we're gonna make sure that the
actors only have one minute per audition.

18:34.981 --> 18:38.049
That way, we'll be moving
at a quicker clip.

18:38.084 --> 18:41.786
'Cause all we're looking for
is a little Christmas magic.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.188
Just be prepared to sit
through a lot of cold.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.990
You know, that's why
we love you, Naomi.

18:46.025 --> 18:49.460
You always see the glass half
empty. Let me make you a deal.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.063
You give me till tomorrow
afternoon, I promise to both of you

18:52.098 --> 18:55.066
I will have a decision on
the direction of the play, OK?

18:57.904 --> 19:01.038
Alright, I'm going inside to get warm.
I'll say this

19:01.074 --> 19:04.308
about our Julian, he definitely thinks
outside of the box. Well, hopefully

19:04.344 --> 19:07.044
this little exercise in futility
will put him back inside

19:07.080 --> 19:10.081
the box. To be honest, I
find his spirit refreshing.

19:10.116 --> 19:14.452
I think we've all been working on
autopilot a little too long around here.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.989
We'll see.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.058
<i>Hey, Charlotte,</i>

19:21.094 --> 19:23.094
it's Sandy, your tireless agent.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.496
Calling you tired clients.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.568
coming down the pipe for you.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.271
What? Lady at the counter?
Woman in the background?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.810
and the company's
holding open calls.

19:44.050 --> 19:47.018
I thought you loved the book. I mean,
how many times have you read it?

19:47.053 --> 19:49.754
Yeah, more times
than I'd care to admit.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.259
Plus, the director
requested you personally.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.129
Really? Who's the director?

20:00.133 --> 20:02.767
all you need to do is come up
with a killer monologue

20:02.802 --> 20:05.369
and go in there and knock
their socks off tomorrow.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.105
OK, yeah.

20:08.141 --> 20:10.308
Wish me luck.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.632
<i>The fact is they just don't have
any parts for me in this play.</i>

20:34.667 --> 20:37.635
I'm too old for Belle,
I'm too young for Mrs. Fezziwig,

20:37.670 --> 20:41.005
and all the other parts are for men.
Who says?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.874
Your agent told you they wanted a whole
new take on the Christmas classic.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.177
That's right. Why settle
for a bit part?

20:46.212 --> 20:48.145
Right.

20:48.181 --> 20:51.916
I mean, if I'm gonna go for broke, I may
as well put it all on the line, right?

20:51.951 --> 20:56.220
- What are you thinking?
- Where's my computer?

20:56.256 --> 21:00.091
Computer... no, no, no.
Computer!

21:00.126 --> 21:01.993
OK.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.228
Enter...

21:04.264 --> 21:08.065
Erlinda... Scrooge.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.437
Yes!

21:13.473 --> 21:16.173
That's right.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.881
<i>God bless us,</i>

21:23.916 --> 21:25.950
every one.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.488
That was great. Thank you.

21:30.523 --> 21:34.292
That was probably the most mature
version of Tiny Tim I've ever seen.

21:34.327 --> 21:38.129
OK, we'll be in touch.
You're not serious! I'm not. That was terrible.

21:38.164 --> 21:42.199
- I told you we'd end up with a mixed bag with these open calls.
- I know.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.368
I'm getting a coffee.

21:44.404 --> 21:47.371
- Who's next?
- Um...

21:47.407 --> 21:50.474
Charlotte, is that you?

21:50.510 --> 21:53.878
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I can't...

21:53.913 --> 21:56.981
- It's me.
- Sid, hi!

21:57.016 --> 21:59.216
You're here to
audition, I hope.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.252
Yes. Yes, I am.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.822
- That's great.
- Who is the director?

22:04.857 --> 22:07.058
Hi, Charlotte.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.163
Um...

22:13.333 --> 22:17.468
You know what, I'm sorry.
I knew this was a big mistake.

22:20.306 --> 22:23.507
Short and pithy,
I'll give her that much.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.243
Charlotte, wait!

22:32.719 --> 22:34.785
Charlotte! Charlotte, wait.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.288
Please, come on, hey. Listen.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.256
Please tell me this is not about
the <i> Thick or Thin</i> audition.

22:39.292 --> 22:41.392
No, I just changed my mind.
I don't wanna do this anymore.

22:41.427 --> 22:45.296
And by the way, that wasn't just an audition,
that was a network test and you decided

22:45.331 --> 22:48.799
to go rogue and improvise. Don't
blame me because you play it safe.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.369
I blame you because
you didn't warn me.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.105
I just took a chance.
And it paid off.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.608
Yeah, paid off for you,
but it totally threw me off.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.643
OK,

22:59.679 --> 23:02.279
if that's what I did,
I'm sorry.

23:02.315 --> 23:05.182
- Well, a lot of good that does me now.
- Look, I believe in you.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.418
I've seen you audition.
You are a very talented actress

23:07.453 --> 23:10.121
and I know you've got something
prepared. We're in there waiting

23:10.156 --> 23:12.790
and excited for you to go in
there and blow us away. Come on!

23:12.825 --> 23:14.859
Well, thank you, coach,

23:14.894 --> 23:17.161
but I'll see you
at the next one.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.464
Charlotte, this is
the next one.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.201
What are you afraid of?

24:05.945 --> 24:09.280
What are you so afraid of?

24:28.734 --> 24:31.368
<i>Thank you. We'll be in touch.</i>

24:31.404 --> 24:34.138
Alright, boss,

24:34.173 --> 24:37.708
that was the final audition.
Any of these stick?

24:39.612 --> 24:42.313
No. 'Fraid not.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.583
I give each one of them
credit for trying.

24:45.618 --> 24:48.586
Franny, what's that saying?

24:48.621 --> 24:52.389
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained?

24:52.425 --> 24:55.559
Excuse me! Hi, sorry.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.428
Am I too late?

24:57.463 --> 24:59.730
- Yes, I'm sorry, we're...
- No, no, no, no.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.233
You're not
too late at all,

25:02.268 --> 25:05.402
Charlotte. Welcome back.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.404
Thanks.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.441
Please, the stage is yours.

25:10.476 --> 25:13.477
Well, first I'll just say...

25:13.513 --> 25:17.515
So, my idea
is a modern retelling

25:17.550 --> 25:19.917
of the classic tale,

25:19.952 --> 25:23.687
told from a female perspective.
Erlinda Scrooge.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.590
Like most of us,

25:26.626 --> 25:29.760
I think she is wondering
how she got here,

25:29.795 --> 25:33.430
what she's doing, and
maybe the most troubling,

25:33.466 --> 25:35.933
where she's headed,

25:35.968 --> 25:39.203
which I think is something
that most of us,

25:39.238 --> 25:41.438
I anyway, can relate to.

25:41.474 --> 25:43.941
Interesting.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.411
Well, we all look forward
to seeing what you've got.

25:47.446 --> 25:52.116
- Great. Um, is it OK to use...
- You can use the whole stage.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.855
- What's her name?
- Charlotte.

26:15.541 --> 26:19.243
Am I really the woman...

26:19.278 --> 26:21.478
who's still at work,

26:21.514 --> 26:25.983
head buried in a laptop
on Christmas Eve,

26:26.018 --> 26:27.851
surrounded

26:27.887 --> 26:31.422
by leftover excuses
of how I got here,

26:31.457 --> 26:34.325
wondering what went wrong,

26:34.360 --> 26:36.493
or worse,

26:36.529 --> 26:39.330
if my best years are behind me?

26:39.365 --> 26:42.499
Please.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.501
I thought my name

26:44.537 --> 26:48.539
would be in bright lights
on big marquees,

26:48.574 --> 26:52.843
not posted to the side of
a cubicle that no one sees.

26:52.878 --> 26:56.013
From now on, I vow
to heed my past

26:56.048 --> 27:00.384
and honor my present while keeping
hope alight for a bright future,

27:00.419 --> 27:03.554
knowing that deep down,
none of that matters.

27:03.589 --> 27:07.558
All that matters
is what is in here.

27:07.593 --> 27:11.629
And I promise to keep
all three spirits alive

27:11.664 --> 27:14.198
within me

27:14.233 --> 27:17.101
forever.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.541
That was great.

27:24.577 --> 27:26.944
Um...

27:26.979 --> 27:29.546
could you wait in the lobby to give
us about ten minutes to discuss?

27:29.582 --> 27:34.451
- Yeah, for sure. Thank you for your time.
- Thank you for your time.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.889
Guys, come on, that...

27:38.924 --> 27:42.326
was amazing. It's a classic tale
told with a real point of view,

27:42.361 --> 27:45.429
with a modern-day twist.
It could work.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.432
It just feels really ambitious.
Come on, Franny, ambitious is good.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.001
Not when you're
on a time crunch.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.570
Plus, Charlotte's
an unknown quantity.

27:53.606 --> 27:57.574
True, but it's a breath of fresh air.
I think that's a good thing.

27:57.610 --> 28:00.911
- It could be a recipe for disaster.
- OK, I know you're scared.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.580
I get it, we're all
scared, right?

28:03.616 --> 28:07.818
But when you see something like that
that's inspiring, you jump on it. Right?

28:09.655 --> 28:12.022
What do you guys say?

28:23.469 --> 28:25.636
Charlotte...

28:25.671 --> 28:27.604
I, um, I have some news.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.542
Now, it wasn't unanimous
by any means,

28:31.577 --> 28:34.778
but we all got together and
thought about it long and hard

28:34.814 --> 28:37.481
and came to a consensus.
It's OK.

28:37.516 --> 28:40.050
I understand.
You're our new Scrooge.

28:40.086 --> 28:42.619
What?

28:42.655 --> 28:44.555
Yeah.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.957
What? No, there must be
some misunderstanding.

28:46.992 --> 28:50.494
No, there's no misunderstanding.
You are our new lead.

28:51.630 --> 28:55.532
Welcome to the company!
We love your idea.

28:55.568 --> 28:59.236
- Now, look, I know we got a lot of work to do before Christmas...
- I understand.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.705
But you, you, Charlotte, are
exactly what we're looking for.

29:01.741 --> 29:05.642
- Seriously?
- Yes! Yes, seriously!

29:05.678 --> 29:07.644
Seriously!

29:10.249 --> 29:13.217
Group hug!
Thank you!

29:13.252 --> 29:15.819
My goodness!
Congratulations.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.255
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.430
I got this!

29:35.307 --> 29:37.841
Hi.

29:42.648 --> 29:45.415
Hello?

29:45.451 --> 29:47.918
I'm sorry it's so late,
but it's just, I couldn't wait

29:47.953 --> 29:49.920
OK.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.590
I just landed a part

29:53.626 --> 29:57.761
in the new production of
<i>A Christmas Carol</i> at the Grand.

29:59.465 --> 30:03.534
Sweetheart!
That is... incredible!

30:03.569 --> 30:06.603
I know. I know. I still can't
believe it's happening.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.539
Well, what...
What is your part?

30:11.677 --> 30:15.212
and I am playing
Erlinda Scrooge.

30:15.247 --> 30:18.048
- I love it already.
- Thanks, Mom.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.684
I guess that means you won't
be able to come home

30:20.719 --> 30:23.787
for Christmas... but that is

30:28.394 --> 30:30.661
And I'm just...

30:30.696 --> 30:33.230
I'm just so proud of you.

30:35.334 --> 30:39.203
And we can just see each other
in the new year, to celebrate

30:39.238 --> 30:41.672
Yes, that we will.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.674
Alright, I love you, Mom.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.742
I love you, baby.

30:45.778 --> 30:48.846
OK, goodnight.

30:50.683 --> 30:53.650
Yes!

30:53.686 --> 30:56.386
Yes! Yes!

30:56.422 --> 30:59.556
Yes! Yes!

31:12.838 --> 31:15.806
- Samantha.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

31:15.841 --> 31:19.910
I was just hoping to surprise you so
we can finally do some catching up.

31:19.945 --> 31:23.280
That's, um, that's
very kind of you, but I...

31:23.315 --> 31:26.617
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

31:26.652 --> 31:28.352
It's our favorite
Cabernet

31:28.387 --> 31:31.688
and it's not exactly
pouring itself.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.224
Samantha, look, I have a very
important dinner meeting

31:34.260 --> 31:37.527
with the Christmas production
directing, so... I can't.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.430
Can't you reschedule? I'd
really love it if we could talk.

31:40.466 --> 31:44.701
You know, co-star to co-star.
Yeah, I will, 100%,

31:44.737 --> 31:47.037
but unfortunately,
this is not the time.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.473
Can I take a rain check?

31:51.577 --> 31:53.277
Sorry.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.712
It's OK.
I just have to go.

31:55.748 --> 31:58.482
They're waiting for me.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.618
We'll, I'll call you
and we'll try to reschedule

32:01.654 --> 32:05.122
when the play is over, you
know what I mean? Yeah.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.736
Julian!

32:19.772 --> 32:22.839
- Hey.
- Hi! How long have you been here?

32:22.875 --> 32:25.776
Since the place opened, I
guess. Yeah, I had lots of work

32:25.811 --> 32:28.245
to get done and I didn't know
when your shift started, so...

32:28.280 --> 32:32.349
- Not for ten minutes.
- Well then, great, have a seat.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.418
This is the rehearsal
schedule, not to mention

32:34.453 --> 32:36.586
some preliminary production
designs, and this...

32:36.622 --> 32:40.257
We need to work on this, OK? This
is gonna be our little opus.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.193
Yes, but I do need to work.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.762
Right. You gotta work.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.298
Um, fine. You work here

32:48.334 --> 32:50.667
and I'll work here.
OK. I like it.

32:50.703 --> 32:54.137
I'll be right here.
OK. Morning, Charlotte.

32:54.173 --> 32:58.442
- Good morning, Gary.
- I haven't seen you wearing that smile in a while.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.777
So I guess
you heard the good news.

33:00.813 --> 33:04.214
- Congratulations. I couldn't be more thrilled for you.
- Thank you.

33:04.249 --> 33:07.351
But I do need to talk to you about
my schedule for the next few weeks.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.486
Don't worry, me and your
director already got that

33:09.521 --> 33:11.788
ironed and put away.
Do you now?

33:11.824 --> 33:13.056
Yes.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.892
Actors have
a way of being

33:15.928 --> 33:19.796
awfully persuasive when they wanna be.
I've heard.

33:29.408 --> 33:33.043
<i>And what I love the most</i>

33:33.078 --> 33:35.479
is that what's happening
to Erlinda's character

33:35.514 --> 33:37.848
is that she's not sounding
anything like Ebenezer.

33:37.883 --> 33:40.951
Exactly. And did you notice, in the entire
script, there isn't a single "humbug"?

33:40.986 --> 33:43.887
'Cause it's real and it's
contemporary and it's modern,

33:43.922 --> 33:46.390
right? Which is exactly the way
we discussed it. I love the idea.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.558
Hey,
you creative folks,

33:48.594 --> 33:51.161
I wish I could let you stay,
but I gotta close up.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.863
Gary, cone on, are you
sure we can't stay?

33:52.898 --> 33:54.965
Just give us a little more time.
Sorry. Gary!

33:55.000 --> 33:59.102
No, he's actually right. People are gonna
keep walking by and seeing the light on,

33:59.138 --> 34:01.838
they're gonna think we're open.
We're not gonna get any work done.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.674
Right. Alright, I have an idea.
Let's go to an all-night diner.

34:04.710 --> 34:08.678
Actually, I think
I have a better idea.

34:08.714 --> 34:11.882
OK?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.920
You're a real
triple threat,

34:16.955 --> 34:19.688
you know that?
You can act,

34:19.725 --> 34:22.292
you can write, and obviously,
you can bake.

34:22.327 --> 34:25.695
Well, don't speak too soon.
You haven't tried one yet.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.632
My mom was the real
baker in the house.

34:28.667 --> 34:33.136
There was nothing like her
famous icebox snowball cookies.

34:33.172 --> 34:36.639
Um,
I'm not an expert,

34:36.675 --> 34:38.842
Charlotte, but that doesn't
look like a snowball cookie.

34:38.877 --> 34:43.112
- I said my mom was the baker.
- OK.

34:43.148 --> 34:46.216
OK, so, back to our story.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.717
Where do you see Erlinda

34:48.754 --> 34:50.786
at the end of the play?
Yeah, well,

34:50.822 --> 34:53.857
I was thinking about that,
and... you know how Scrooge

34:53.891 --> 34:57.127
looks back on his youth as,
like, a missed opportunity?

34:57.162 --> 34:59.229
Well, I was thinking

34:59.264 --> 35:03.467
that Erlinda could maybe see it
as a second chance.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.671
And who wouldn't
want that, right?

35:07.706 --> 35:11.308
- Well, that's the point.
- I like that. OK.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.644
To second chances.
To second chances.

35:17.049 --> 35:19.916
So, what made you
want to direct?

35:19.952 --> 35:22.853
Um... I suppose
I'm...

35:22.888 --> 35:26.256
I'm looking for
my second chance too.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.592
Yeah, my dad, um...

35:28.627 --> 35:31.528
huge influence on me in the
theatre. You know, growing up,

35:31.563 --> 35:36.433
Christmas was never about being around Christmas
trees or presents or anything like that.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.802
It was about being around him
and being on stage.

35:38.837 --> 35:42.105
So you really
are a theatre rat.

35:42.141 --> 35:45.709
I was, yeah.
And then came TV,

35:45.744 --> 35:49.045
and my agents are dying for me
to go back to it, but...

35:49.081 --> 35:51.281
when this play came to me,

35:51.316 --> 35:55.785
I just... I just
couldn't turn it down.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.722
And...

35:58.757 --> 36:01.992
I didn't want to miss
this opportunity.

36:02.027 --> 36:05.962
Well, that makes two of us.

36:09.701 --> 36:12.369
Alright, let's get back to work.
Yeah.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.372
- OK.
- OK. Opening, Act III.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.644
Good morning, Grand Company.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.647
Hand those out for me? Thank
you. You know, in the wee hours

36:23.682 --> 36:27.217
of the morning, Charlotte and I
were working furiously

36:27.252 --> 36:31.321
to get to the final touches on our little
production here. You must be running

36:31.356 --> 36:34.090
on pure adrenaline. That and
plenty of Christmas cookies.

36:34.126 --> 36:38.495
OK, I gotta ask, somebody answer me this:
how is my cohort in crime look brighter

36:38.530 --> 36:40.530
and bushier than I do
this morning?

36:40.566 --> 36:43.033
Lots of hair and makeup.
Beneath it all, I'm half asleep.

36:43.068 --> 36:46.036
That makes two of us.
Here you go.

36:46.071 --> 36:49.706
- Think we can talk casting?
- Yes, good point, Naomi.

36:49.741 --> 36:53.009
Casting. So listen, I was
thinking that the Ghost

36:53.045 --> 36:56.680
of Christmas Past should be
our youngest member.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.916
- That would be me, sir.
- Yes, it would, Brady. You up for the challenge?

36:59.952 --> 37:02.852
Can you handle that?
We'll find out soon enough. Yes, we will.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.022
And the Ghost
of Christmas Present...

37:06.058 --> 37:08.358
is going to... What
are you looking at?

37:12.898 --> 37:15.699
Speaking of the present.

37:15.734 --> 37:19.102
Dennis Hayes, to what
do we owe the pleasure?

37:19.137 --> 37:22.372
I was hoping we might
have a word.

37:22.407 --> 37:25.942
- Up there?
- Please.

37:28.113 --> 37:31.481
Let's take five, OK?

37:33.151 --> 37:37.721
OK, everybody,
we are back at 11:53.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.225
If you don't mind, I'd love
to take your measurements.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.394
Of course, yeah.
Who is Dennis Hayes?

37:44.429 --> 37:47.230
The real
company Scrooge.

37:47.266 --> 37:49.833
He owns the place.
Inherited it from his father,

37:49.868 --> 37:52.135
who is a real
arts' lover.

37:52.170 --> 37:55.572
- I see. And his son?
- Not so much.

37:55.607 --> 37:58.742
I'll meet you over there.
OK, sure.

38:17.129 --> 38:21.097
Mr. Hayes. I assume you're not
here for season tickets.

38:21.133 --> 38:23.433
I'm afraid not.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.770
But I don't want to beat
around the bush.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.041
What is this?

38:37.215 --> 38:40.817
Now you're planning
on mowing it down.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.620
Your lease ends this year.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.989
It was hard for me
to make this decision,

38:46.024 --> 38:48.725
but I'm putting this place
on the market come January.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.896
What about the theatre company?
We've been here for 50 years.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.532
Unfortunately,
that's not my concern.

38:55.567 --> 38:59.969
Property in this city is far
more valuable than sentiment.

39:11.083 --> 39:14.317
Um, everybody, if...

39:14.353 --> 39:17.320
I could just have everybody's
attention for a second.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.823
Guys, can I have your attention?

39:19.858 --> 39:23.360
Um, I have a short
announcement to make.

39:23.395 --> 39:26.863
Um...

39:26.898 --> 39:30.233
Production of <i> Christmas Carol</i>
this season is gonna be...

39:30.268 --> 39:32.836
this theatre company's
final performance. What?

39:32.871 --> 39:36.906
I don't understand. This theatre
has been around for...

39:36.942 --> 39:38.908
Generations.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.778
I know. Trust me.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.680
I grew up here.

39:43.715 --> 39:48.351
Its owner supported our vision.
Unfortunately, this guy...

39:48.387 --> 39:51.855
Only supports
the bottom line.

39:51.890 --> 39:55.291
Well, so...
what can we do?

39:55.327 --> 39:58.795
I say we give this
little theatre of ours

39:58.830 --> 40:00.563
the greatest send-off ever.

40:00.599 --> 40:04.868
We put together the best
holiday show ever.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.873
That's it?

40:09.908 --> 40:11.841
And then what, we shut our doors

40:11.877 --> 40:15.912
and go our separate ways,
pretending this was just a job?

40:15.947 --> 40:18.715
Julian, I don't...
I don't need to tell you,

40:18.750 --> 40:22.886
this theatre company
has been my family!

40:30.262 --> 40:32.228
Guys, I'm sorry.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.998
Well, I guess our company
will have to find another space

40:35.033 --> 40:38.234
to perform in
next year.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.905
I don't
believe this.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.974
I can't believe

40:45.010 --> 40:48.077
that fate would give us

40:48.113 --> 40:50.914
this incredible opportunity

40:50.949 --> 40:53.583
only to, what, let it slip away?

40:53.618 --> 40:56.920
Charlotte, we're not
gonna let it slip away.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.989
It's just that none of us...

41:00.025 --> 41:02.258
know what to do at the moment.

41:02.294 --> 41:05.428
Sounds a lot like my life.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.034
You know what we need?

41:11.069 --> 41:13.002
What?

41:13.038 --> 41:17.273
A Christmas miracle.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.847
Well, in that case,
I guess it's...

41:23.882 --> 41:26.449
'tis the season to find one.

41:37.062 --> 41:39.696
Excuse me.

41:40.765 --> 41:43.399
- Hi.
- Hi!

41:43.435 --> 41:46.469
- Sucker punch table for one, please.
- Yeah...

41:46.505 --> 41:48.738
I take it you didn't see that coming.
Did you?

41:48.773 --> 41:52.809
I don't think any of us saw it
coming. That is the business.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.411
Yeah, I know.
This whole thing

41:55.447 --> 41:57.981
feels like a replay of my
career. I can't tell you

41:58.016 --> 42:00.383
how many times I have landed
roles only to discover

42:00.418 --> 42:02.652
they ended up on
the cutting room floor.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.721
How do we even have
the stomach for this?

42:04.756 --> 42:09.192
Sometimes I think the only
reason I'm still doing this

42:09.227 --> 42:12.128
is because I can hear my dad
whispering in my ear.

42:12.163 --> 42:16.432
- Is he the one that encouraged you to be an actress?
- Yeah. He was a dreamer,

42:16.468 --> 42:19.168
trapped in the body of
an ad salesman from Ohio

42:19.204 --> 42:21.604
trying to support his family.

42:21.640 --> 42:25.675
He passed when I was in college,
so it's just me and my mom now.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.410
I'm sorry.

42:27.445 --> 42:30.013
But I'm sure he's very proud
that the dream lives on.

42:30.048 --> 42:33.683
Lives on...
on life support.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.953
- Come on.
- I have a friend

42:36.988 --> 42:39.556
who put me up for
a job in Chicago.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.858
Really?

42:41.893 --> 42:46.429
A job. Not a gig, but a job. - Yeah.

42:46.464 --> 42:48.865
Yeah, I gotta tell you,

42:48.900 --> 42:51.067
Charlotte, I don't know
if I like the sound of that.

42:51.102 --> 42:54.737
Well, I think we have
bigger fish to fry.

42:54.773 --> 42:56.873
True. No doubt. OK,

42:56.908 --> 42:59.876
what's the priority, then? Mount
the play or save the theatre?

42:59.911 --> 43:02.712
- Both.
- I knew you would say that.

43:02.747 --> 43:05.315
- Yeah. You thirsty?
- Yeah.

43:05.350 --> 43:08.885
And I'm hungry, too.
That's good.

43:08.920 --> 43:13.323
Menu. Great.

43:17.696 --> 43:21.097
<i>OK, people, we have to show
Mr. Hayes that the Grand</i>

43:21.132 --> 43:24.067
is worth keeping before the new
year. I was up all night,

43:24.102 --> 43:27.337
and this is my conclusion. The only
way we're gonna save the Grand

43:27.372 --> 43:30.707
is getting people interested in what we're
saying, right? Right, and right now,

43:30.742 --> 43:33.009
what we know is we have a show
opening in a week and a half

43:33.044 --> 43:36.179
and a website that is so ancient it
can't even take online purchases.

43:36.214 --> 43:39.015
I think I helped
design that in 1997.

43:39.050 --> 43:41.851
Well, that's an easy fix, but it's
not gonna turn this place around.

43:41.886 --> 43:44.187
No, no, no, that's where you're wrong.
It's a good start. It's a good start.

43:44.222 --> 43:48.024
We need buzz for the Grand. We gotta get people
knowing what we're doing for the community,

43:48.059 --> 43:51.628
you know? You know how many careers
were launched from this theatre?

43:51.663 --> 43:54.163
I've seen quite a few.
Stars of stage <i> and</i> screen.

43:54.199 --> 43:58.534
See? That's the kind of information we need
to get out there. Right now, this theatre

43:58.570 --> 44:01.037
is New York's best-kept secret.
But we're gonna change that,

44:01.072 --> 44:05.608
because we're gonna give this theatre the
buzz and publicity it deserves, right?

44:05.644 --> 44:09.078
Even if it means drawing
on your celebrity?

44:09.114 --> 44:12.081
Naomi, whatever it takes.

44:12.117 --> 44:14.250
And what it takes right now...

44:14.285 --> 44:16.619
is a selfie.

44:20.425 --> 44:22.492
- Charlotte, hold up.
- Um?

44:22.527 --> 44:24.394
You know, you have a way
of motivating a crowd

44:24.429 --> 44:27.597
that's really inspiring.
Even when the outcome

44:27.632 --> 44:29.799
is seemingly,
you know, bleak.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.801
Well, I guess it's all
those years of rejection

44:31.836 --> 44:34.070
really strengthening
the bounce back instinct.

44:34.105 --> 44:37.674
I get it. It really think
this time is gonna be different.

44:37.709 --> 44:42.111
You know what? This time,
it is gonna be different.

44:42.147 --> 44:44.414
- My scarf.
- Hey!

44:44.449 --> 44:46.849
Forgot something?
Yes, thank you.

44:46.885 --> 44:49.852
Hey, listen, you were
fantastic up there tonight.

44:49.888 --> 44:53.489
- Thank you. You too.
- Thank you. Um...

44:53.525 --> 44:55.491
Tomorrow's your day off, right?
Yeah.

44:55.527 --> 44:58.027
I was thinking maybe we
hang out. You know, regroup.

44:58.063 --> 44:59.696
- Regroup?
- Yeah.

44:59.731 --> 45:02.031
- What did you have in mind?
- I can't tell you, it's a surprise.

45:02.067 --> 45:05.334
But what I will tell you
is I'll swing by around noon.

45:05.370 --> 45:07.370
How is that?
That sounds great.

45:07.405 --> 45:09.672
I'm game.
Great! See you then.

45:09.708 --> 45:12.041
- See you then.
- Alright.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.849
It is so not a date!

45:19.884 --> 45:22.785
Think of it as a
working field trip.

45:22.821 --> 45:25.788
Then why are you
wearing your good earrings?

45:25.824 --> 45:28.291
Because I lost one
of my bad earrings.

45:28.326 --> 45:30.560
I just don't want you
getting your hopes up.

45:30.595 --> 45:33.362
- For what?
- Julian Walker.

45:33.398 --> 45:36.199
According to this,
he's unavailable.

45:36.234 --> 45:39.135
- Well, I see.
- It's true.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.871
There's pictures of him here
all over Manhattan

45:41.906 --> 45:43.973
with his former co-star,
Samantha Cross.

45:44.008 --> 45:47.310
- Um...
- It just don't want you getting your heart broken.

45:47.345 --> 45:49.712
Well, don't worry.
This is totally safe.

45:49.748 --> 45:51.714
Remember my rule
about not dating actors?

45:51.750 --> 45:54.016
Right. I guess
I confused you with me

45:54.052 --> 45:56.753
and my "really want
to date an actor" rule.

45:58.857 --> 46:02.992
Behave.

46:10.034 --> 46:12.335
Hi!

46:12.370 --> 46:14.537
Hi.

46:14.572 --> 46:17.607
Morgan, Julian.
Julian, Morgan.

46:17.642 --> 46:19.742
Nice to meet you.

46:21.546 --> 46:24.380
Not funny.
Okay... Bye.

46:24.415 --> 46:26.415
- Bye.
- Have a great day.

46:26.451 --> 46:29.352
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

46:34.259 --> 46:37.527
To tell the truth,
there's nothing like Christmas

46:37.562 --> 46:41.898
in Manhattan!
The energy! The sounds!

46:41.933 --> 46:44.133
The people, the smells! It's
the best thing in the world!

46:44.169 --> 46:46.135
You know, you're right.
You're right.

46:46.171 --> 46:48.237
This town does come alive
like no other.

46:48.273 --> 46:50.139
Yeah, well that's...
Alright, see?

46:50.175 --> 46:52.141
- Yeah.
- Tough town to walk away from!

46:52.177 --> 46:54.210
You are about
as subtle as a dump truck

46:54.245 --> 46:56.045
in a dinnerware factory.

46:56.080 --> 46:58.214
- What does that even mean?
- I don't even know.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.216
Remember this place?

47:00.251 --> 47:03.619
Yeah. Come one.

47:15.366 --> 47:17.834
Our old acting studio.

47:17.869 --> 47:19.569
Let's go in.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.337
Julian, we don't even know
if it still exists.

47:21.372 --> 47:24.173
So what? There's only one way
to find out. Come on, let's go.

47:24.209 --> 47:26.509
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

47:32.383 --> 47:35.084
Okay.

47:40.291 --> 47:43.025
This place?

47:43.061 --> 47:45.695
It's like we never left.

47:45.730 --> 47:47.763
If the walls could talk...

47:47.799 --> 47:50.533
They would say
there is no failing,

47:50.568 --> 47:52.668
only bold choices.

47:52.704 --> 47:55.538
Bold, right?
We were so bold!

47:55.573 --> 47:58.207
And you...

47:58.243 --> 48:00.676
You were so good at the improv!
What?

48:00.712 --> 48:04.280
Yes! Me, that wasn't my thing.
I wasn't so great at that.

48:04.315 --> 48:07.116
What? No, seriously?
It's not what came across.

48:07.151 --> 48:09.118
Well, that's 'cause I took
my mom's advice, right?

48:09.153 --> 48:11.120
"Fake it till you make it."

48:11.155 --> 48:14.123
Remember that, um,
that Santa reindeer thing

48:14.158 --> 48:16.259
that we did?
The fear of flying seminar.

48:16.294 --> 48:19.061
Yes!

48:19.097 --> 48:21.330
that was so much fun. You know,
we were really good together.

48:21.366 --> 48:23.332
We were.

48:23.368 --> 48:26.202
Gosh, I felt so alive then.

48:26.237 --> 48:29.639
So free.

48:32.277 --> 48:33.910
Wait...

48:33.945 --> 48:36.245
Is that why
you brought me here?

48:36.281 --> 48:38.180
Yeah.

48:43.187 --> 48:45.755
You know, I don't know
what happened

48:45.790 --> 48:48.691
the day of that
<i>Thick of Thin</i> audition.

48:48.726 --> 48:52.561
I thought you said
I threw you.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.497
Well, you did.

48:54.532 --> 48:57.366
But that was me.

48:57.402 --> 49:00.236
I was afraid
to take a chance.

49:00.271 --> 49:04.573
Yeah, I understand
why I didn't get that part.

49:04.609 --> 49:06.342
- Um...
- But to be honest,

49:06.377 --> 49:08.711
the worst part about the whole
thing was that I didn't get

49:08.746 --> 49:13.516
the opportunity to work
with you. We could have had fun.

49:18.589 --> 49:22.625
Okay, so... First real
professional acting gig?

49:22.660 --> 49:25.761
That would be
a fast-food commercial.

49:25.797 --> 49:27.763
Yes.

49:27.799 --> 49:29.899
I had so many French fries
that day, I got sick.

49:29.934 --> 49:31.867
What about you?

49:31.903 --> 49:34.570
Um... I was
an extra on a soap.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.539
Yeah. I remember I got paid

49:36.574 --> 49:38.474
for sitting around all day
and I thought, Woah!

49:38.509 --> 49:40.543
The worst thing that you
can be doing to get paid.

49:40.578 --> 49:42.545
This is true.
Alright, subject change.

49:42.580 --> 49:44.547
Favorite Christmas memory?

49:44.582 --> 49:46.582
Um... You first.

49:46.617 --> 49:48.718
Well that's easy.
It was one of the times

49:48.753 --> 49:50.786
my mom came to visit,
and I got a legit job.

49:50.822 --> 49:53.122
So I took her
to see the carolers

49:53.157 --> 49:55.124
at Rockefeller Center.
Really?

49:55.159 --> 49:57.126
And then we went
and had a Christmas dinner

49:57.161 --> 49:59.295
at Tavern on the Green
with the money I'd made.

49:59.330 --> 50:01.897
- Sounds really special.
- It was, for both of us.

50:01.933 --> 50:04.967
I can tell
you really miss her.

50:05.003 --> 50:07.603
Yeah, well
after my dad passed,

50:07.638 --> 50:09.739
it was just the two of us.

50:09.774 --> 50:13.476
I haven't seen since...
I can't even remember.

50:13.511 --> 50:16.245
What's your favorite
Christmas memory?

50:16.280 --> 50:19.415
It would have
to be here.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.584
Yeah, in New York.

50:21.619 --> 50:23.386
Yeah, I was ten

50:23.421 --> 50:25.921
and there was this crazy
snowstorm, and afterwards,

50:25.957 --> 50:28.958
my dad took me and my brothers
out to a snowball fight.

50:28.993 --> 50:30.726
What, you've never done
a snowball fight before?

50:30.762 --> 50:33.662
- Nope. And I plan on keeping it that way.
- Why? It's fun!

50:33.698 --> 50:36.665
I've got a great idea.
We'll do a duel. One snowball,

50:36.701 --> 50:38.667
three steps.
A duel? No.

50:38.703 --> 50:42.338
What are you afraid of?
What's wrong?

50:42.373 --> 50:44.607
Alright.

50:44.642 --> 50:46.475
There! See,

50:46.511 --> 50:49.211
there's the fire
in your eyes. Okay, good!

50:49.247 --> 50:52.181
Alright, you're on!
Okay, now it's three steps.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.183
- Okay. Is that a rule?
- That's a rule,

50:54.218 --> 50:56.452
but you've got to turn around.
It's the rule.

50:56.487 --> 50:58.454
- Okay.
- Okay, now don't cheat.

50:58.489 --> 51:01.223
Okay, ready?
Yeah.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.492
One...
Two... Three!

51:03.528 --> 51:06.896
My gosh! My gosh!

51:06.931 --> 51:08.898
Are you okay?

51:08.933 --> 51:11.467
Geez!
Whoops.

51:11.502 --> 51:14.470
Man!

51:14.505 --> 51:16.806
So, I guess
you can scratch that

51:16.841 --> 51:19.008
off your bucket list.
Your first snowball fight.

51:19.043 --> 51:21.010
And for the kids
watching at home,

51:21.045 --> 51:23.479
that would be
Charlotte 1, Julian 0.

51:23.514 --> 51:26.849
- No, I don't think so. I think you jumped on too.
- Spoken like true sore loser.

51:26.884 --> 51:29.318
- I'm not a sore loser.
- Really?

51:29.353 --> 51:32.822
Yeah. Now we're tied.

51:34.459 --> 51:37.226
I had a really good time.
I had a great time.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.328
Alright.

51:41.532 --> 51:44.500
Okay...

51:44.535 --> 51:46.836
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

52:04.422 --> 52:07.189
Ellen,
thanks for coming to New York

52:07.225 --> 52:09.191
for this interview.
It's no problem.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.494
I had some business in town.
By the way,

52:11.529 --> 52:13.496
how is it that New York City
is the only place on Earth

52:13.531 --> 52:15.397
that can make crème brûlée
this scrumptious?

52:15.433 --> 52:17.833
People say the same thing
about the pizza.

52:17.869 --> 52:20.436
There's something about
this city that must be magic.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.671
So how do you feel
about a move to Chicago?

52:22.707 --> 52:24.507
To be honest,

52:24.542 --> 52:27.343
I've been trying to open up
my mind to new possibilities,

52:27.378 --> 52:30.079
and I'm liking the idea
of a new adventure.

52:30.114 --> 52:33.616
What a refreshing way to look
at life. Change can be good.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.551
Change can be good.

52:35.586 --> 52:39.288
Well... You've certainly
given me a lot to think about.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.690
I do have other
candidates to consider,

52:41.726 --> 52:43.792
but you're definitely
in the mix.

52:43.828 --> 52:47.096
I'm so happy Rachel
recommended you.

52:52.603 --> 52:55.571
Really?

53:00.578 --> 53:02.478
Hey...

53:02.513 --> 53:05.548
Sorry, is it just me or did
our apartment get smaller?

53:05.583 --> 53:07.716
- Liz is homeless.
- I'm not homeless,

53:07.752 --> 53:10.152
I'm just domicile-deprived.

53:10.188 --> 53:13.389
I don't think that's
even a word. What happened?

53:13.424 --> 53:16.325
I was subletting from this girl
who, turns out, was subletting

53:16.360 --> 53:18.394
from this guy who moved
upstate but didn't like it,

53:18.429 --> 53:20.896
'cause it was like too quiet.
Not like it usually is here.

53:20.932 --> 53:23.632
He showed up yesterday
wanting his place back.

53:23.668 --> 53:25.601
I'm so sorry, Charlotte.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.903
I had no place to go.
It's fine. Totally fine.

53:27.939 --> 53:29.905
You can stay here.

53:29.941 --> 53:32.641
You know, if you're
still considering

53:32.677 --> 53:36.579
that move to Chicago, I'd be
happy to take over your lease.

53:36.614 --> 53:38.747
Really? You would
do that for me?

53:38.783 --> 53:41.083
You're such a lamb.

53:41.118 --> 53:44.486
Real subtle. Why don't
you ask to help her pack?

53:44.522 --> 53:47.189
What are you looking for?

53:47.225 --> 53:49.458
Costume change. I need
to go back to the theatre

53:49.493 --> 53:51.460
wearing something festive.

53:51.495 --> 53:53.762
Okay, how about...

53:53.798 --> 53:56.599
this?
That's perfect.

53:56.634 --> 53:58.601
Absolutely perfect.

53:58.636 --> 54:00.603
Thank you.

54:00.638 --> 54:03.772
Another outing
with Julian Walker?

54:03.808 --> 54:07.443
Something like that.

54:07.478 --> 54:10.512
Okay, I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a reaction.

54:25.096 --> 54:27.062
Um... So when
the Grand Company

54:27.098 --> 54:29.064
actually asked me to direct
this season's production

54:29.100 --> 54:30.966
of <i> Christmas Carol,</i>
I must say I was thrilled.

54:31.002 --> 54:32.835
But not because of what
the play meant to me.

54:32.870 --> 54:36.739
<i>I truly believe that theme
is even more relevant today</i>

54:36.774 --> 54:38.807
<i>than ever, right?</i>
Not bad there, mister.

54:38.843 --> 54:42.077
<i>Yeah, and this theatre has
such a long past with this city</i>

54:42.113 --> 54:44.713
<i>and an incredible present
with this show. And we're hoping</i>

54:44.749 --> 54:46.815
<i>for a bright future, and that
community will get involved</i>

54:46.851 --> 54:48.884
<i>and support us.
Come and support us!</i>

54:48.919 --> 54:51.220
<i>- Please!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

54:51.255 --> 54:54.690
Well said! Now,
what do you guys think?

54:54.725 --> 54:57.326
Talk to me.

54:57.361 --> 55:00.229
Well, I won't lie.
We'll definitely help.

55:00.264 --> 55:03.832
- I'm sensing a "but"...
- I'm sure we'll sell the run,

55:03.868 --> 55:05.834
yes, but I'm not sure

55:05.870 --> 55:07.836
this publicity's enough
to save the theatre.

55:07.872 --> 55:11.674
We need to cast
a wider net.

55:11.709 --> 55:14.710
Julian?

55:14.745 --> 55:18.013
- Yeah, what's up?
- Um...

55:18.049 --> 55:20.949
I don't mean to pry
into your personal life,

55:20.985 --> 55:22.951
but I'm sure I don't
have to tell you

55:22.987 --> 55:24.953
that your former co-star
Samantha Cross

55:24.989 --> 55:27.423
is somewhat of a
social media phenomenon.

55:27.458 --> 55:30.192
With over three million
followers, her endorsement

55:30.227 --> 55:32.361
could really go a long way
towards our cause.

55:32.396 --> 55:35.798
So you're
asking me to talk to Samantha?

55:35.833 --> 55:39.702
- I think that would be amazing!
- I'll see what I can do.

55:39.737 --> 55:42.905
Good idea.

55:53.250 --> 55:56.318
There's a Throwback
Thursday for you.

55:56.354 --> 55:58.721
That's Julian's father
standing outside the theatre

55:58.756 --> 56:02.624
with Peter Hayes.
Who's the little boy?

56:02.660 --> 56:04.760
Our current owner,

56:04.795 --> 56:07.463
Dennis Hayes.

56:07.498 --> 56:10.399
The times were more
innocent back then.

56:10.434 --> 56:13.335
Hey, I think
they're pretty great now.

56:15.005 --> 56:17.906
Hey, we looked pretty good
out there?

56:17.942 --> 56:21.243
Yeah, I know.
We're a pretty good team.

56:21.278 --> 56:23.178
I think it looks great,
you guys.

56:23.214 --> 56:25.514
Let's light it up.
Yeah.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.516
I got it, I got it!

56:29.520 --> 56:32.121
- Okay, Sid, fire it up.
- Here we go!

56:34.825 --> 56:37.426
That certainly
lights up

56:37.461 --> 56:39.762
this old lobby!
It certainly does!

56:39.797 --> 56:42.631
You know, I can't remember
the last time I actually...

56:42.666 --> 56:45.434
put up a Christmas tree.
You're kidding!

56:45.469 --> 56:47.503
No. At this time of year, I'm
usually traveling and working.

56:47.538 --> 56:50.706
You really
are a scrooge.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.342
That hurt.

56:53.377 --> 56:56.545
Okay... You got it?

56:56.580 --> 56:58.881
Yup. Come on.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.749
There we go. Lights.

57:00.785 --> 57:03.819
Okay... You just had to get
the biggest tree in the lot,

57:03.854 --> 57:05.821
did you?
Yup!

57:05.856 --> 57:08.390
Woah...

57:08.426 --> 57:10.726
I think your place
can handle it, though.

57:10.761 --> 57:14.129
Yeah, well I am kind of
a minimalist, aren't I?

57:15.833 --> 57:18.133
You know, they say
a person's décor

57:18.169 --> 57:20.135
is a reflection
of what they want

57:20.171 --> 57:22.538
the world to see.

57:22.573 --> 57:25.808
I'm getting a hiding
in plain sight kind of vibe.

57:25.843 --> 57:27.876
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:27.912 --> 57:31.246
Well, if this acting thing doesn't work
out, you'd make a great therapist.

57:31.282 --> 57:33.816
- Nice deflection.
- You got to psychoanalyse me,

57:33.851 --> 57:35.551
now help me
with this thing.

57:35.586 --> 57:38.787
You know what? I think
it should go right here.

57:38.823 --> 57:41.390
It'd be the first thing people
see when they walk in the door.

57:41.425 --> 57:44.059
Okay. Well,
I can see a method

57:44.094 --> 57:46.061
to your madness.
Yeah?

57:46.096 --> 57:48.697
Perfect.

57:48.732 --> 57:52.000
Now the fun begins.
Yeah. Decorations, right?

57:52.036 --> 57:54.503
- Um-um.
- It's been a while.

57:54.538 --> 57:56.505
I don't know how many
decorations I have.

57:56.540 --> 57:58.841
- I can make anything work.
- Really? Okay,

57:58.876 --> 58:00.843
I'll see what I got.
Okay.

58:00.878 --> 58:02.611
Lucky for you,

58:02.646 --> 58:05.581
I am a master
at Christmas decorating.

58:05.616 --> 58:07.583
- Really?
- Yep! I don't know what it is,

58:07.618 --> 58:09.585
something about
this time of year.

58:09.620 --> 58:12.788
I just get this special feeling,
like finding the right guy

58:12.823 --> 58:14.857
to put the star on top
of the Christmas tree.

58:16.894 --> 58:19.528
I can handle it.

58:19.563 --> 58:21.296
I've got this.

58:21.332 --> 58:24.600
So listen... What are
your plans for the New Year?

58:24.635 --> 58:27.703
I'm still trying to figure that out. I
think I'm just gonna play it by ear.

58:27.738 --> 58:30.639
So there is no one
special in your life?

58:30.674 --> 58:32.641
No. I think
that's why I'm willing

58:32.676 --> 58:35.544
to take some risks right now.
You know, shake things up.

58:35.579 --> 58:37.913
I think I'm on the same boat.
My agents think that

58:37.948 --> 58:42.718
this theatre gig is my way
of hiding from the spotlight.

58:42.753 --> 58:44.453
Is it?

58:44.488 --> 58:46.822
I mean, I can't imagine this
whole fame thing being easy.

58:46.857 --> 58:49.458
I mean, I don't want
to complain, but yeah.

58:49.493 --> 58:52.895
You get caught up in it
once in a while.

58:54.598 --> 58:56.565
I just know what my roommate
reads in the tabloids.

58:56.600 --> 58:59.334
Okay.
About Samantha and I?

58:59.370 --> 59:01.336
- Not my business.
- That's okay.

59:01.372 --> 59:03.906
It's not my business.
But one of the reasons

59:03.941 --> 59:05.807
I will never date an actor.

59:05.843 --> 59:07.809
You... Okay, hold on a sec.
You're not gonna date an actor?

59:07.845 --> 59:10.279
No, hard-and-fast rule.
Never ends well.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.581
I think I would do better with,
like, an accountant type.

59:12.616 --> 59:14.316
No-no-no.

59:14.351 --> 59:16.685
Boring. Way too safe.
Safe? Don't knock safe.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.687
Safe is good.
Safe is dependable,

59:18.722 --> 59:21.189
especially when you're living
paycheck to paycheck.

59:21.225 --> 59:23.926
Alright.
Still boring, though.

59:23.961 --> 59:25.994
Let's light this thing up.
What do you think? Ready?

59:26.030 --> 59:28.030
- Yeah.
- Three... Two...

59:31.001 --> 59:32.935
- Looks great.
- It's so great.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.937
I gotta hand it
to you, Charlotte,

59:34.972 --> 59:37.606
you really know how to
bring life to a room.

59:39.243 --> 59:41.209
Okay... Toast!

59:41.245 --> 59:43.979
Yeah. Thank you.

59:44.014 --> 59:45.714
- To...
- The most perfect tree.

59:45.749 --> 59:48.450
- The most perfect tree.
- Like, ever.

59:51.522 --> 59:53.922
No, Mom, I already told you
I'm not gonna make it home

59:53.958 --> 59:56.692
for Christmas. Okay...

59:56.727 --> 59:58.961
I have to figure out a way
to nail this McMann account

59:58.996 --> 01:00:01.029
so I can get that promotion
that I deserve.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:04.266
Are you kidding me?

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:06.602
Who's phone is that?

01:00:06.637 --> 01:00:10.839
Who's phone is that?
Come on, anyone?

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:16.612
You know what, I'm sorry.

01:00:16.647 --> 01:00:19.848
I think it's mine.
I thought I turned it off.

01:00:19.883 --> 01:00:21.717
Okay, um...

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:24.219
It's fine, Charlotte.
Let's take five.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:29.024
Rach?

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.460
Hi! Yeah,

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:33.462
I know I owe you a phone call.
I've just been so busy.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:36.932
I know! I see.
Looks like you

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.167
and your almost <i> Thick or Thin</i>
co-star have become quite thick!

01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:40.969
<i>- Please!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:43.338
I am actually at rehearsal
right now, so can I please

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:45.407
call you tonight?

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.976
I'm just calling
with some huge news.

01:00:48.012 --> 01:00:49.978
You got the job!

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:57.085
That is great news.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:01:01.156
Um... But I'm
at rehearsal right now,

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:03.325
so I'll call you tonight, okay?

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.028
In the meantime, I'm going
to pick out your office.

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:08.330
Okay, bye.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.869
Well... It looks like Julian
finally dialed up the heat.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:17.673
He must have contacted
that Samantha Cross

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:20.709
because our theatre's
Twitter feed is buzzing.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:24.279
- So that's good?
- Yes, very good!

01:01:24.314 --> 01:01:26.281
The story of our
theatre's plight

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.884
is going out to millions
of Samantha's followers.

01:01:28.919 --> 01:01:32.621
- Woah...
- This is just the shot in the arm we need.

01:01:32.656 --> 01:01:34.623
I don't understand.
Why did it take Julian

01:01:34.658 --> 01:01:36.958
so long to ask Samantha
to get involved?

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.194
Well...

01:01:39.229 --> 01:01:41.930
I think their
relationship status

01:01:41.965 --> 01:01:44.199
is complicated.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:52.374
- Everything okay?
- Great, yeah.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:55.377
I put my phone on silent.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:58.280
Thanks.
Okay, let's get back at it.

01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:01.717
Um... Charlotte,
let's try this again.

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:09.758
Hey, Char, be honest.
What do you think?

01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:12.494
Really nice. You're
going to a Christmas party?

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:14.830
Yeah, an ugly
Christmas sweater party.

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:17.232
Well,
then you look perfect.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:23.105
What's going on with you?

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.107
You've been in a funk ever since
you got back from rehearsal.

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:28.410
I'm fine. I'm just, you know,
burning it at all ends.

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:30.679
I have an extra sweater
if you want to join.

01:02:30.714 --> 01:02:32.214
I would,

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.117
but I still have another shift I
have to cover before Christmas.

01:02:35.152 --> 01:02:38.754
Right. But you must be
getting pretty excited, right?

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:41.089
- For what?
- Your show!

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:43.825
- Right!
- We should go.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:46.161
- Yes, I'd love to go.
- We'll get our tickets...

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:49.097
We could reserve
tickets ahead of time!

01:03:33.577 --> 01:03:36.378
Excuse me, can we get
the check, please?

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:41.650
You've been staring at that tree
half the night. What's up?

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.887
I think this might be one of
my last shifts at the bistro.

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:49.758
- You mean for the year?
- I mean for forever.

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:53.161
I got offered
that job in Chicago.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:55.197
So you're gonna take it?

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:57.833
I don't see how
I can turn it down.

01:03:59.536 --> 01:04:01.670
It's a great salary,
plus a moving bonus.

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:03.672
My friend Rachel lives there,
my mom lives there.

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:07.843
Are you trying to sell me
or sell yourself?

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:12.180
I said I needed a change.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:14.516
And change is never easy.

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:18.086
And as much fun as
I'm having doing this play...

01:04:19.723 --> 01:04:21.957
I just can't keep
living like this.

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:26.761
Yeah.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:56.391
Coming!

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.664
Merry early Christmas!

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.400
You didn't have
to bring me this.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:07.402
I know. I wanted to.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.404
Let's see...

01:05:09.439 --> 01:05:12.607
Where can we put
a little more Christmas?

01:05:12.643 --> 01:05:14.809
How about right here?
Sure.

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:18.446
- Perfect.
- Yeah, looks great.

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:20.515
So...

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:22.584
I got your message.

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:24.920
What's going on?
Are you okay?

01:05:24.955 --> 01:05:28.823
Well, let's start with the...
the good news, shall we?

01:05:28.859 --> 01:05:31.927
The place looking spectacular,
thanks largely due to you.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:35.530
And you. And the
entire Grand Company.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.099
- Yes.
- What else?

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:42.037
I just got offered
another TV series in LA.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:48.310
That's... great, right?
That's exciting.

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:52.280
Sure, it's exciting, until
you open up and read the script.

01:05:52.316 --> 01:05:54.883
It's just another watered down
version of the same thing

01:05:54.918 --> 01:05:57.652
I've been playing
for the last five years.

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:59.654
I'm grateful I'm working,
but I don't...

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:02.390
I don't want to spend the next
five years doing the same thing.

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:04.392
I get it.

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.895
We're kind of in
a similar situation.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.865
I got offered
that job in Chicago.

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:16.338
Congratulations.
That's exciting.

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:19.140
Do you maybe want
to say that again,

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:21.142
but this time with
a little more feeling?

01:06:21.178 --> 01:06:23.812
You know, congratulations!
That's exciting!

01:06:23.847 --> 01:06:27.315
- It is!
- Man...

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:29.684
Can I ask you something?

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:33.655
How did we get here?

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:38.259
I don't think it's about
how we got here.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:41.329
I think the real question is,

01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:43.431
Where are we headed?

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:49.738
It's like Grand
Central Station.

01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:53.375
Um... Hold that thought.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.544
Merry Christmas, Julian.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.347
Samantha. Hi.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:02.684
What a surprise.

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:05.854
Um... Samantha,
this is Charlotte.

01:07:05.889 --> 01:07:08.390
She's the star of the Broadway
show we're doing tomorrow night.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:11.693
Yeah, our holiday play.
This is our star.

01:07:11.728 --> 01:07:13.495
Yeah, that's me.
And this is my exit.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.865
- Wait, I wanted to talk to...
- No, have a good night.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:22.871
Do you want to come in,
Samantha?

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:28.576
Are you okay?

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.578
Yeah, I'm good.
Come on in.

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:32.947
Come on,
let me fix you a drink.

01:07:42.359 --> 01:07:46.494
And all three spirits
will live inside forever.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:51.833
Perfect. Love it!
Good work, everyone.

01:07:51.868 --> 01:07:53.668
It was great.
Yeah?

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:55.537
You sure you don't want me to...
No, no, no.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.572
Come on, I don't want to over
rehearse. Let's keep it fresh.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.707
It was wonderful!
Fresh, right. Fresh is good.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:02.277
Yes! Everyone, listen up!
We're going to be doing

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:04.512
curtain calls before
the show tonight. Naomi.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:06.514
Thanks, Julian.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:10.185
Everyone has a call sheet. Hair
and makeup for feature players

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.121
is 5pm, sharp.
And before you leave,

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:16.024
please, everyone, I'll need
all costumes on the rack

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:18.693
to be accounted for,
please. Thank you.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.528
Thank you.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:22.697
So, listen... How are you
feeling about the show tonight?

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:26.201
I guess as good
as I can, right?

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:28.937
I mean, the butterflies are
definitely starting to flutter.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.939
Well, it's okay. Just relax.
If you're half as good

01:08:30.974 --> 01:08:34.542
as you were in the rehearsal,
I'm wrapped on your finger.

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:36.411
Listen...

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.214
- You go.
- No, you go.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:40.948
Okay, um...

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:43.551
I wanted to talk to you
about last night.

01:08:43.587 --> 01:08:45.319
Samantha and I,

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:48.323
we're not...
Julian, it's fine.

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.558
Really. It's not even
any of my business.

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:52.560
No, I understand that,
but it got a little awkward

01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:55.162
when you left, and I didn't
want you to get the wrong idea.

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:57.564
I'm taking the job
in Chicago.

01:09:00.036 --> 01:09:03.671
- You are?
- Yes. Yes.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.939
I am.

01:09:07.611 --> 01:09:09.810
I don't understand.
Why the change of heart?

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:12.613
I just...

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:16.151
really don't feel like there's
anything left for me here.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:20.488
I mean, hey,

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.758
if that's what you want to do,
I'm happy for you.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.660
Thanks.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:28.696
Okay, well,
I should get changed.

01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:31.866
Yeah.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:50.118
No, I understand the boardroom
being in the center.

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.720
I don't understand it
being as small as...

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:55.123
Mr. Hayes? Hi.

01:09:55.158 --> 01:09:58.293
Hi. Charlotte Miller.
Thank you for coming.

01:09:58.328 --> 01:10:00.795
I had meetings scheduled.
So, you're one of the players

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.830
of the soon-to-be
defunct theatre group,

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.832
I assume?
One of the visiting members,

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.968
yes.
I really hope

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:09.504
you didn't ask me here
to give me a piece of your mind.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.674
Not exactly.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.310
I discovered this inside
the theatre and I thought

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:17.679
you should have it.
What is this?

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.547
A photo of the old gang?

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.549
Hoping to pull at my
heartstrings, are we?

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:25.253
Actually, it's a photo
of you and your father,

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:27.822
and Julian's father
in front of the Grand Theatre.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.664
- Innocent times?
- Yes.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.566
Yes, they were.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:41.269
I understand your father
was a big supporter of the arts.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:44.572
He called
this his folly.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:47.842
He had a head for business, but
the heart of a starving artist.

01:10:47.877 --> 01:10:50.778
Maybe he sensed
there was room for both.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:53.181
Miss Miller,

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:56.184
I'm honestly not trying
to be the bad guy here.

01:10:56.219 --> 01:10:58.453
This is just
about good business.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:00.221
I understand.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:03.291
But your father did find a way
for arts and business

01:11:03.326 --> 01:11:06.894
to coexist and turn a profit.
True,

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.697
but at a time when this was
a thriving art district.

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:11.699
Hey, have you checked
your social media?

01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:14.269
Our little show is gonna be
the next big thing!

01:11:16.406 --> 01:11:19.274
Alright, well...
Merry Christmas.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:24.212
Merry Christmas.
Thank you.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.053
Listen, I need you to
make sure the crew double-checks

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:34.389
all the spots, okay?
I'm not it.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:35.857
Great.

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:39.661
By the way, thanks to you, our
social media has been on fire.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:41.963
Ever since that girlfriend
of yours took to Twitter...

01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:44.599
Okay, hold on.
Sorry, um...

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:47.669
That person is not
my girlfriend.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:50.238
I'm sorry.

01:11:50.273 --> 01:11:52.340
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to assume.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.575
- No problem.
- But with any luck,

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.411
she might just help us
save the place.

01:11:58.048 --> 01:12:01.816
Hi there, Julian.
I got one here for you.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:04.986
And here's yours.
What's this?

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:06.988
That's a crew gift.
Charlotte got us one.

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:09.457
That's nice of her.
Alright, thanks.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:11.759
Hey, break a leg.
I'm proud of you.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:46.027
You know, your dad
would really be proud.

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:48.796
Thanks, Franny.

01:12:48.832 --> 01:12:52.133
I'd like to think so too.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.837
So, tell me something.

01:12:55.872 --> 01:12:57.905
Are you really gonna
let her get away?

01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:01.409
- Franny...
- I've been in the business

01:13:01.444 --> 01:13:04.045
long enough to know
when I see true chemistry.

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.982
Unfortunately,
I think I'm too late.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:11.853
Charlotte's already
made up her mind, so...

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:14.021
Maybe.

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:17.325
Have you made up yours?

01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.441
Okay, guys, break a leg.

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.843
Keep the energy up
in the first act, okay?

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.464
Hey, Mom!

01:13:56.499 --> 01:13:58.599
I tried you earlier,
I guess you're not around.

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:02.103
Um... I miss you. I will
try you after the show, okay?

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:04.739
I love you.
Merry Christmas.

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:30.364
Look at the ceiling!

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.916
Check.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.419
Alright, here we go,
everybody.

01:14:53.957 --> 01:14:57.225
I'm so sorry.
I think I just pulled too hard.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.428
No harm. Maybe it's
a good omen. Good as new.

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:02.797
- Thank you.
- Break a leg.

01:15:04.467 --> 01:15:07.034
- Have a good show!
- Thank you!

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.570
- How are you doing?
- Me? I'm great.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.806
I should be asking
you that question.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.242
- I'm... surprisingly calm.
- Good.

01:15:14.277 --> 01:15:16.310
Good to hear. Um...

01:15:16.346 --> 01:15:19.213
I also wanted to...
give you this.

01:15:19.249 --> 01:15:22.550
It's... just for insurance.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:25.386
It's, um... It's a prop
from my dad's first performance

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:27.788
in <i> Merchant of Venice.</i>
A Shakespearian part.

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:32.393
I used to take it with me
on auditions for good luck.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:36.631
Thank you.

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:40.234
Hey, just be you.
You'll be great.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:42.236
I love it.

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:46.807
Okay...
Yeah, um... Yes?

01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:49.744
I just want to say
thank you for everything.

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:51.746
- Yeah, great.
- We have a seat out there

01:15:51.781 --> 01:15:53.748
for you, okay?
You want me out there?

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.750
- Enjoy the show!
- Okay, thank you.

01:15:55.785 --> 01:15:58.119
Alright, everybody,
here we go!

01:15:58.154 --> 01:16:00.421
Break legs.
Have a great show, everybody.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:04.692
Are you ready?

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.331
<i>I learned to heed
the past, honor my present</i>

01:16:10.366 --> 01:16:12.867
<i>and maybe, most of all,
keep hope alive</i>

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:15.603
<i>towards a bright future.
And so,</i>

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:19.774
<i>God bless us, everyone.</i>

01:16:34.057 --> 01:16:37.892
Thank you.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:40.294
Woo-oo!

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.224
Hey, it's my mom!

01:17:10.259 --> 01:17:12.226
You deserve it.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:35.483
- Sweetheart! Sweetheart!
- Mom!

01:17:35.518 --> 01:17:37.985
- You were incredible!
- You were amazing!

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:40.988
Thank you! I'm so glad
you got to see it!

01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:43.290
How did you get here?
I wouldn't have missed it

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.726
for the world! At least
that's what I kept telling

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:49.330
that Julian fellow when he
offered to fly me out here.

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:52.400
- He did?
- You crushed it!

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:54.602
- You guys!
- Best show ever!

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:56.971
Thank you, guys!
Thank you so much!

01:17:57.006 --> 01:18:00.007
Charlotte, honestly. I mean,
I knew you were good, but...

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:02.810
- Gary!
- You were so amazing!

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:04.845
- Thank you!
- I'll say,

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:07.415
you came alive out there
on that stage.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.517
Rachel, I can't take

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:11.519
that job in Chicago.
Please.

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:13.821
I figured that out
by the end of the first act.

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:16.357
Really?
You're not mad?

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:18.192
No!

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:21.028
Guys, can you turn down
the music, please? Thanks.

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:25.433
Um... Everybody obviously knows
Mr. Dennis Hayes here,

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:28.169
our landlord and
owner of the Grand.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:31.372
If you can give him a moment of
your time, he has a few words.

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:37.211
Um, everyone, please.
Just give him a chance, okay?

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:39.947
I know this might be
impossible to believe,

01:18:39.982 --> 01:18:42.183
but Mr. Hayes is actually
seeing the lights

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:45.886
about what this theatre
means to the community.

01:18:45.922 --> 01:18:47.888
I'm a businessman first,

01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:51.392
and have holdings in
many properties in the area.

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:54.195
Now, due to the exposure

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:57.231
all that social media
has generated,

01:18:57.266 --> 01:19:01.335
developers are clamoring to
revive the old theatre district.

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:03.137
And...

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:05.406
you can't have
an old theatre district

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:07.408
without an old theatre.

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.344
It appears keeping
you people in business

01:19:10.379 --> 01:19:12.480
<i>is</i> good business.

01:19:12.515 --> 01:19:14.482
So what you're
saying, Mr. Hayes,

01:19:14.517 --> 01:19:17.885
is that the Grand
Theatre Company lives on?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.887
I think our fathers
would be proud.

01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:23.424
It's a Christmas miracle!

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:25.993
Woo! Awesome!

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:28.095
Come on!

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:33.434
Okay, a toast!
A toast!

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:36.437
- Yes.
- To the Grand Company!

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:38.706
The Grand Company!

01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:42.910
Woo!

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:46.580
You were wonderful tonight.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:48.916
Play me out, Gary!

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:52.453
Cheers,
you guys!

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:54.455
- Cheers!
- Julian, you really know

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.124
how to throw a surprise party.
You guys, anytime!

01:19:57.160 --> 01:19:59.293
Hey! Cheers, you guys.
Cheers!

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:01.629
Congratulations!
You guys were wonderful!

01:20:03.666 --> 01:20:05.800
This one is for you.
Thank you!

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:08.569
And thank you
for all of this.

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:10.571
It's a special night.

01:20:10.606 --> 01:20:12.473
So listen,<i> you</i> were the one,

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:14.775
weren't you, who convinced
Hayes to keep us going?

01:20:14.811 --> 01:20:17.812
His bark
is worse than his bite.

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:20.481
Actually, no,
they're both really bad.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:25.119
But we did find a common ground.
You're amazing, really.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.887
Thanks.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:29.557
Yeah, for the first
time like, ever,

01:20:29.592 --> 01:20:32.760
I'm actually starting
to believe that.

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:34.628
Good. You should.

01:20:34.664 --> 01:20:37.097
So where's Samantha?

01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:41.135
Last time I heard,
she was on her way to Greece

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.003
for a holiday with
her new boyfriend.

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.005
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:47.575
You assumed I was
still dating her?

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.510
I didn't know!
It's not my business.

01:20:49.545 --> 01:20:51.512
Speaking of business,
what's going on

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:53.681
with this trip to Chicago
to start a new career?

01:20:53.716 --> 01:20:55.649
Um...

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:58.519
I'm passing on that job.
Okay.

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:00.588
Yeah. No risk,
no reward, right?

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:02.790
I think I'm gonna stay
around New York and,

01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:05.492
I don't know,
see where that leads me.

01:21:07.163 --> 01:21:09.530
Well, that certainly
could pose a problem.

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:13.534
Some problems?

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:17.872
- No!
- Let's get out of here.

01:21:17.907 --> 01:21:20.107
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go outside.

01:21:20.142 --> 01:21:22.977
I don't want to leave,
so I decided, you know what?

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.312
I'm gonna pass
on that gig out in LA,

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:27.548
so I can devote
more of my time here

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:30.317
as the new artistic director.

01:21:31.988 --> 01:21:34.321
That's fantastic!

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:38.292
- Thank you.
- So, what's the problem?

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:40.027
Well, come on,

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.563
you have this hard-and-fast rule
about never dating an actor.

01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:53.641
Well, you know what they say
about rules, right?

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:55.743
What's that?
