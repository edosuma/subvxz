00:34.680 --> 00:39.037
Born is a baby, gentle as may be

00:39.240 --> 00:45.110
Son of the eternal, Father supernal

00:45.320 --> 00:49.996
Past three o'clock
and a cold, frosty morning

00:50.200 --> 00:55.593
Past three o'clock,
good morrow, masters, all

00:55.800 --> 00:57.552
Past three o'clock

01:00.720 --> 01:05.271
Past three o'clock,
good morrow, masters, all

01:05.480 --> 01:11.316
Seraph quire singeth,
angel bell ringeth...

01:24.280 --> 01:28.068
- Is she here yet?
- Not yet. Calm down, Dad.

01:30.480 --> 01:35.031
- What do you want, boy or girl?
- I don't want to know, I'm old fashioned.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.360
- So why's she coming?
- I don't wanna know, but I'm dying to know.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.916
- Elaine is here, Michael.
- At the office?

01:53.320 --> 01:56.198
I might have news for you tomorrow, kids.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.756
Look, here, this is for the kid.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.713
- What is it?
- An ounce of solid gold.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.718
He's not born and you want him in banking!

02:05.920 --> 02:12.598
By the time he's 21, he can buy a car
with it, or pay for a college education.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.916
It's sweet, Tommy, thanks.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.032
It's always there for you when you need it.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.195
Well, what's it gonna be? A little Matthew?

02:23.400 --> 02:29.748
I gotta admit that's my choice. Matt,
cowardly and nervous, just like his dad!

02:31.600 --> 02:35.036
Wait, what if it's a girl? Mathilda!

02:35.240 --> 02:41.475
Your choice. I could get used to it.
Sweet Mathilda of the Lowlands!

02:41.680 --> 02:46.196
I know it's your mother's name,
but have you considered...

02:48.200 --> 02:51.590
- Are you all right? Is the baby?
- Mmm.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.269
What is this?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.869
It's a test I had done.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.751
- A genetic test.
- Why would you have that done?

03:08.960 --> 03:10.837
I had a reason.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.433
Tommy?

03:24.080 --> 03:26.355
It's not yours, Michael.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.036
She's not yours.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.873
Well... this'll be nice
in the memory box, won't it?

05:27.640 --> 05:30.359
The bogey man! Come on!

06:23.680 --> 06:28.071
That is nice work. Put it just there.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.991
Feel the top.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.433
Nice.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.279
Well, there he goes again.
Every week, like clockwork.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.516
It's not our business. Where?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.915
Must be pay day.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.318
Met this school teacher guy
who knew him about five years ago.

07:01.520 --> 07:06.958
Said he had a personality. Must've hocked it
at Miss Simon's store. Ain't got one now.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.313
Nice coin, huh?
I wasn't kidding about the grade.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.876
You should get it. What do you think of this?

07:18.080 --> 07:23.552
Won't be here long once the weather balloon
people get to hear about it!

07:23.760 --> 07:27.196
Guess they're like
the moose head collectors.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.674
Huh?

07:29.720 --> 07:33.554
Never mind, I don't understand
half of what you say anyway.

07:33.760 --> 07:37.230
- Hey, Mom.
- There you are. Will you watch the store?

07:37.440 --> 07:39.431
Hey, c'mere.

07:54.920 --> 07:58.310
There's a guy on line
with some Milwaukee Liberties.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.954
He's in California, so no sales tax.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.549
I'm not interested in silver.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.910
Sorry, just getting some quotes.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.751
- You can do all that from there?
- I could flush the Vatican toilet.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.754
Silver's good, why just gold?

08:17.960 --> 08:25.071
It's always there for you when you need it.
I'll take the coin. Thank you, Mrs Simon.

08:25.280 --> 08:28.272
You could call me April after five years!

08:28.480 --> 08:30.789
Joe, where's my lucky scratchcard?

08:31.000 --> 08:35.471
When I hit this thing, there will be
some changes made around here!

08:35.679 --> 08:38.477
- Yeah, you're gonna do that!
- Why not?

08:41.360 --> 08:44.591
Gimme $20.
I wanna continue my lucky streak.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.519
How long has that been going on, Tanny?

08:47.720 --> 08:50.712
Since birth, boys... since birth.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.359
This McCann guy, he pays y'all rent,
don't he?

08:56.440 --> 09:00.399
So I guess you know
what goes on up there, right?

09:01.480 --> 09:05.951
Jodie down at the bank, she says
McCann ain't got no bank account,

09:06.160 --> 09:08.071
never even cashes a cheque.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.397
- I think he keeps it at home.
- Good for him.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.957
Mine's at Morgan Stanley. I dole it out
to my big brother when I see fit.

09:16.160 --> 09:20.995
Daddy's plan, not mine.
I'd give it all to him right now.

09:21.200 --> 09:25.159
Hey now, there we go!
Gimme five bucks, my man!

11:11.920 --> 11:16.471
...from the outside.
Oh, a tremendous hit down the field.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.148
That ball went 100 yards, probably!

11:21.600 --> 11:25.513
Down towards the goal.
0-0 in the first chukka.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.951
Newland scores! Goal for John Newland.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.788
Soon to be our representative
in Washington,

11:33.040 --> 11:35.429
if his money means anything at all.

11:35.680 --> 11:40.595
Tell them that if they vote for me,
not only do I promise world peace,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.837
but I'll fix all the pot holes
in Stuart Street!

11:46.200 --> 11:48.270
Your brother is so great.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.758
- You looked good out there.
- Campaigning or polo playing?

11:59.960 --> 12:06.035
If we're going to put party money behind you,
we want to know that you are clean.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.755
What about... your brother?

12:10.960 --> 12:14.669
He was a bit embarrassing
after your state campaign.

12:14.880 --> 12:18.668
We all know that brothers
don't lose elections, don't we?

12:18.880 --> 12:22.509
- Can you control him?
- Always.

12:25.480 --> 12:31.271
Do me a favour, don't tell any jokes.
They don't mix with politics.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.029
I will be decidedly... unfunny.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.680
Still need me, don't ya?

12:45.880 --> 12:50.635
I'll be going out afterwards,
so can I please use your car?

12:50.840 --> 12:52.114
No.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.153
Predictable answer.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.872
I said no. Take the Plymouth.

13:01.080 --> 13:05.995
"Say, girls, wanna ride in my '66 Plymouth?"
I don't think so.

13:06.200 --> 13:11.035
You'll be too high to notice the car,
and so will the trash you're with!

13:11.240 --> 13:15.199
You get sober and now you think
you're Jesus, is that it?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.311
Daddy's boy!

13:17.520 --> 13:23.117
You wouldn't be so wonderful if everybody
knew what I knew, would you?

13:26.080 --> 13:28.799
Listen to me! If I lose, you lose!

13:30.360 --> 13:35.036
Go get drunk, get stoned, get laid,
just do it in a Plymouth!

13:35.240 --> 13:37.276
Do you hear me?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.070
Pennies from heaven.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.070
Pennies is right.

14:23.840 --> 14:29.836
Tell him we need more.
Tell him his little girl needs more.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.794
I do tell him, but it doesn't help.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.431
- Don't! That's all I've got!
- I'll bring it back.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.918
I promise. The two of you deserve
a lot more than all this.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.999
All he wants is to keep you high
so you'll be quiet.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.356
Invest it wisely.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.073
That ought to warm your heart, Daddy.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.792
Just save your dying soul

16:11.680 --> 16:18.028
Baby, please give me one more chance

16:20.440 --> 16:26.754
I'll do anything for you

16:28.840 --> 16:35.393
Baby, please give me one more chance

16:37.080 --> 16:43.997
I'll do anything for you

16:45.960 --> 16:52.229
You are old enough to know...

17:09.160 --> 17:10.512
Slow down!

17:12.000 --> 17:13.512
Shit!

17:16.280 --> 17:18.271
- Dammit!
- Shut up!

17:19.400 --> 17:21.435
Shut up!

17:21.640 --> 17:23.232
No!

18:02.360 --> 18:05.033
Jeez, what a night!

18:15.240 --> 18:17.151
Oh, my God!

18:22.040 --> 18:23.598
Shit!

18:37.600 --> 18:40.433
Well, well, Mr McCann...

20:57.720 --> 20:59.233
No!

21:07.600 --> 21:09.113
Nothing.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.835
There was a stranger in town last week
hanging round the bar.

21:17.040 --> 21:23.388
We'll check him out, but I think it's someone
who knew the area, the way they vanished.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.229
Have you... er... have you got insurance?

21:36.120 --> 21:39.635
Mr Newland, what about your brother's
disappearance?

21:39.840 --> 21:44.630
Why, Nancy Lambert,
so... how did y'all vote?

21:44.840 --> 21:47.832
Well, I just couldn't make up my mind.

21:48.040 --> 21:53.160
- Is your brother in South America?
- Any information on Tanny?

22:00.320 --> 22:06.111
The police say that Tanny left her for dead.
I've left that out of the story for now.

22:06.320 --> 22:11.952
He robbed McCann and left town, probably
uninjured because of the driver's air bag,

22:12.160 --> 22:16.995
and there was no blood around McCann's
house, plus he made a quick getaway.

22:17.200 --> 22:22.672
Tanny wouldn't hurt himself, as you know,
Cal. He just likes to hurt others.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.356
When I take my sugar to tea

22:48.560 --> 22:51.552
I'm a rowdy-dowdy, that's me...

22:51.760 --> 22:56.038
- Hello, Judge Marcus. I'm Nancy Lambert.
- You know my name?

22:56.240 --> 22:59.755
I studied Jones vs Dobson in college.
You made our town.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.758
- Thank you.
- Hello, Dr Roberts.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.793
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. Hello.

23:08.960 --> 23:14.512
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz
with those millionaires...

23:15.880 --> 23:17.836
Where is the money man?

23:24.880 --> 23:27.235
That's your father.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.635
Do you wanna see your father?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.319
Baby.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.590
He'd like that, wouldn't he?

23:36.680 --> 23:41.595
What's he doing tonight, honey?
What's your daddy doing tonight?

23:41.800 --> 23:44.075
He's forgot about you.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.556
He shouldn't have forgot
about his little girl.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.076
You wanna see your father?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.236
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes.

25:15.920 --> 25:17.797
Mommy.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.956
Come on, baby.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.476
C'mere, sweetie.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.114
Jesus!

28:33.280 --> 28:35.396
Mommy!

28:36.560 --> 28:40.109
"Mommy"? Boy, are you off.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.276
Mommy!

28:45.680 --> 28:48.274
Stay! Stay... sit!

28:48.480 --> 28:49.799
Sit.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.510
- Does anyone know this child?
- What is it, McCann?

29:55.720 --> 29:59.156
- I want the doctor.
- OK. Let me take it upstairs.

29:59.360 --> 30:04.673
There's a woman lying in the snow
outside my house. She's dead, I think.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.668
Somebody get the doctor.

30:12.240 --> 30:16.518
Mrs Simon, would you take care of the child?
I'll get the truck.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.236
Take us to the spot.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.034
- Sure.
- It's all right. It's all right.

30:41.840 --> 30:48.757
Heroin user.
That kid is probably damaged goods.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.476
Do you know who she is?

30:54.680 --> 30:56.910
I've never seen her before.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.391
Anyone want a mint?

32:22.600 --> 32:25.319
You're not damaged goods, are you, kid?

32:38.080 --> 32:39.911
She likes you the most.

32:40.120 --> 32:44.591
I think we should get her
to Elderfield welfare department.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.270
- Where would she end up?
- No way of knowing.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.315
- Far away most likely.
- She's alone and I'm alone.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.272
What do you mean?

32:56.400 --> 32:59.710
She came to replace my money, you know.

33:01.520 --> 33:05.832
- What if I kept her?
- You mean, kept her here in town?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.270
Just be yourself.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.189
I don't have a self.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.753
- You live alone?
- I am divorced.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.592
Do you think you'd make a good father?

33:51.720 --> 33:53.278
Yes, I do.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.193
- Do you own any property?
- No.

33:58.440 --> 34:02.752
I did. I had it stolen.
I mean, it was stolen from me.

34:02.960 --> 34:07.715
"I had it stolen"
sounds like I asked someone to steal it.

34:07.920 --> 34:12.789
I didn't. I had it taken... you know.

34:13.440 --> 34:17.149
- Are you a homosexual?
- Not that I know of.

34:17.360 --> 34:23.549
I mean, I'm not. I just don't have
any interest in that... area.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.512
He is.

34:25.719 --> 34:29.395
How could you, a single man,
take care of this child?

34:30.600 --> 34:33.353
Well... I would wake up...

34:33.560 --> 34:39.590
and then I would... take care of the child
and then I would go to bed.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.395
What about when you go to work?

34:43.600 --> 34:49.311
I wouldn't go to work. I work at home.
I make furniture.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.795
In fact, I could offer you both
a nice armoire.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.831
Forgive me.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.237
It's not that easy to raise a child.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.954
Nothing is easy.

35:03.160 --> 35:09.429
Look, I'm not good at interviews, so you have
to overlook everything you see right now,

35:09.640 --> 35:15.510
much as when you get served jell-o, it might
not look appetising quivering in a bowl,

35:15.720 --> 35:18.188
but it actually tastes quite good.

35:18.400 --> 35:23.599
If you gave me this child, I'm sure
that if you came back in a year,

35:23.800 --> 35:26.519
you would be very impressed.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.030
I believe this child belongs with me.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.397
She walked into my house.

35:38.120 --> 35:44.389
Mr Newland, I think we can discuss
the McCann adoption.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.479
If we can't fix that, we can't fix anything.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.591
Shall we go upstairs?

36:22.280 --> 36:24.510
Hello, Momma!

36:35.600 --> 36:40.833
I said to Dr Roberts, "How did this
happen?" He said, "Don't ask." So I didn't.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.838
I think it was favour outside the system!

36:44.040 --> 36:49.273
Finally, corruption for the good guy.
I've got tons of Lawrence's baby stuff.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.630
Hey, test that on your wrist.

36:51.840 --> 36:53.114
Why?

36:53.320 --> 36:54.958
Jesus!

36:55.160 --> 36:57.116
That's why.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.556
What about a name for her?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.756
I want to call her Mathilda.

37:08.160 --> 37:12.119
I will give you the deed to my house
not to call her Mathilda.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.950
She'll have to spell it all the time,
people will call her Tilly. No, no.

37:17.160 --> 37:19.071
It's what I've decided.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.477
If anyone calls her Tilly,
you'll have to kill them.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.238
Hey... Mathilda.

37:24.440 --> 37:25.714
Hi.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.913
April...

38:32.600 --> 38:36.912
This is the first time I've seen you
buying something for someone else.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.676
This is for me.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.439
- Why?
- I was kidding.

38:43.640 --> 38:47.997
Another first,
if you don't mind me saying so.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.518
Two cents.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.239
Daddy.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.557
Hello, Michael.

39:54.680 --> 39:56.636
Now, let's see.

39:56.840 --> 40:00.310
If I were your age, what would I like to eat?

40:02.280 --> 40:05.397
What about... baby food?

40:05.600 --> 40:09.115
That sounds delicious! And I have some.

40:09.320 --> 40:13.711
What better time of life than your age
to enjoy baby food?

40:13.920 --> 40:18.630
Somehow, as one gets older,
one loses one's taste for unsalted carrots,

40:18.840 --> 40:22.753
although I've heard that Paris restaurants
are now serving it.

40:22.960 --> 40:27.795
So, just give me a little taste,
just a little taste.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.198
Doesn't that look good?
Open up just a little bit.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.789
Hey, look at me. I'm eating it.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.872
I'll make you some oatmeal.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.997
Mathilda...

40:48.800 --> 40:50.950
Mathilda

40:51.160 --> 40:55.438
Mathilda, you take-a my money
and run Venezuela

40:55.640 --> 40:58.438
Once again now! Mathilda...

40:58.640 --> 41:01.108
Baby, baby, baby! Mathilda

41:03.680 --> 41:05.955
You take-a my money
and run Venezuela!

41:11.400 --> 41:12.958
Hey, there.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.474
Mathilda?

41:31.320 --> 41:32.958
Mathilda?

41:49.240 --> 41:52.869
You think that's hilarious?
You think that's hilarious?!

41:53.080 --> 41:56.516
You're naughty, naughty, naughty!
Nice, nice, nice!

42:13.920 --> 42:15.956
He'll be back, baby.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.799
I need something
to amuse a three-year-old.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.715
- My pay cheque.
- Very funny.

42:27.960 --> 42:31.635
You've had this weather balloon a long time.
How much is it?

42:31.840 --> 42:33.193
100 bucks?

42:35.800 --> 42:38.109
- Would you take five?
- Sold!

42:38.320 --> 42:40.515
Where can I get gas?

42:40.720 --> 42:42.472
Diner across the street?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.868
Here we go! Up, up and away!

42:54.360 --> 42:55.998
Hello, Mathilda!

42:58.600 --> 43:00.955
Hey, Lawrence, come here!

43:01.160 --> 43:02.479
C'mere!

43:02.680 --> 43:05.319
Wave goodbye, just in case.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.358
Nice day for a swim!

43:28.200 --> 43:30.714
Here I come, here I come!

43:36.520 --> 43:38.875
My turn now! You had your turn!

43:40.360 --> 43:42.396
Hey, Mathilda! Whoa!

43:44.320 --> 43:47.392
We're coming in for a perfect four-pointer!

43:53.200 --> 43:54.553
That one hurt!

43:56.600 --> 43:58.830
Go, Tilly!

44:31.880 --> 44:33.518
Nancy?

44:35.680 --> 44:36.999
What?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.479
What?

45:04.560 --> 45:06.710
Esther, I don't think we...

45:07.760 --> 45:11.150
...have enough salmon.
Why don't we send for some more?

45:11.360 --> 45:13.669
I think there's enough, Mrs Newland.

45:13.880 --> 45:19.671
You've got six guests and two large salmon.
You'll have leftovers for a week!

45:28.920 --> 45:32.037
Call the doctor! Somebody call the doctor!

45:32.920 --> 45:35.036
We can try again.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.639
Hmm?

45:37.840 --> 45:40.638
Think of the fun we'll have.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.956
I'm sorry.

45:46.280 --> 45:51.274
I don't want you ever to say that to me
again, you hear me?

45:54.440 --> 45:56.635
You will have a child.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.675
We will.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.592
Mathilda?

46:37.960 --> 46:40.633
Mathilda! Mathilda, honey?

46:44.200 --> 46:46.475
Mathilda!

47:36.240 --> 47:38.595
Mathilda!

47:51.720 --> 47:54.359
You're killing me! You're killing me!

47:54.560 --> 47:58.872
They gotta get a fence around this place,
or someone's gonna fall in!

48:03.720 --> 48:05.915
We're coming down! Oh!

48:15.240 --> 48:17.390
There you go!

48:17.600 --> 48:21.070
Don't do that to Daddy any more.
Don't do it to Daddy.

48:24.240 --> 48:27.869
You have to punish her or she'll never learn.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.833
- I can't do that.
- Do it again!

48:31.040 --> 48:34.157
- I can't spank her.
- Nobody says to spank her.

48:34.360 --> 48:38.433
- What do I do? Behead her teddy?
- I'd have to report you for that.

48:38.640 --> 48:42.235
With Lawrence, I used to put him
in the corner for an hour.

48:42.440 --> 48:45.238
Don't do it. Look what it's done to me.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.118
I did it!

49:31.200 --> 49:33.316
OK, you are free.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.390
All right, what do you want to do today?

50:10.880 --> 50:13.838
This is school! You'll finally meet
someone younger than me!

50:14.040 --> 50:18.238
- Are you her father?
- She adopted me, yeah.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.431
Can I talk to you?

50:42.680 --> 50:45.274
It is used for many things.

50:45.480 --> 50:52.511
You use it to write on and draw on.
What is it?

51:03.960 --> 51:07.191
You getting your degree yet, Mr McCann?

51:20.280 --> 51:24.239
Don't twist the puppy's head.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.114
Mathilda?

51:51.120 --> 51:55.875
- What's going on?
- Mouse burial. We found a dead mouse.

52:02.640 --> 52:04.710
Do you like... do you like horses?

52:05.880 --> 52:07.279
How did your mouse die?

52:07.480 --> 52:11.837
It was run over by a car.
That's why we're burying it in a pizza box.

52:12.040 --> 52:13.393
I see.

52:13.600 --> 52:15.431
I'm kidding.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.431
Oh, I see.

52:18.640 --> 52:23.395
Cat got it. Nobody's fault really,
just one of those things.

52:24.200 --> 52:26.873
Well... have a nice burial.

52:27.080 --> 52:29.799
We're trying, but it's hard.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.797
- Bye.
- Bye.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.753
What's wrong?

53:34.080 --> 53:35.638
What's the matter?

53:38.640 --> 53:40.471
I can write really small.

53:40.680 --> 53:42.272
What do you mean?

53:49.080 --> 53:53.471
- What is it?
- It's the 23rd Psalm.

53:53.680 --> 53:55.716
Holy smokes!

53:55.920 --> 53:58.878
I guess "Why?" would be inappropriate.

53:59.080 --> 54:00.593
Cool, huh?

54:01.800 --> 54:04.997
- Are you suffering from ennui?
- Huh?

54:05.200 --> 54:06.519
Come on.

54:17.960 --> 54:21.316
On the banks of the river

54:21.520 --> 54:25.593
Stood Running Bear,
young Indian brave

54:25.800 --> 54:29.429
On the other side of the river

54:29.640 --> 54:33.349
Stood his lovely Indian maid

54:33.560 --> 54:36.950
Sweet Little White Dove was her name

54:37.160 --> 54:40.709
Such a lovely sight to see

54:40.920 --> 54:44.549
But their tribes fought with each other

54:44.760 --> 54:48.435
So their love could never be

54:48.640 --> 54:52.428
Running Bear dove in the water

54:52.640 --> 54:56.349
Little White Dove did the same

54:56.560 --> 55:00.314
And they swam out to each other

55:00.520 --> 55:04.069
Through the swirling stream they came

55:04.280 --> 55:07.590
As their hands touched
and their lips met

55:07.800 --> 55:11.429
The raging river pulled them down

55:11.640 --> 55:15.474
Now they'll always be together

55:15.680 --> 55:19.309
In that Happy Hunting Ground

55:19.520 --> 55:23.399
Running Bear loved Little White Dove

55:23.600 --> 55:27.149
With a love that couldn't die!

55:35.800 --> 55:38.473
Dad, we gotta get out more.

56:28.320 --> 56:33.110
Come on, hit the ball. That's a baseball bat,
not a rolling pin. Go do cookery!

56:33.320 --> 56:37.871
Come on, sissy, you can't play baseball!
Don't waste our time.

56:39.280 --> 56:42.033
Pitch. She can't hit, she's a girl!

56:44.080 --> 56:45.991
OK, strike one!

56:46.200 --> 56:49.192
- Boy, are we losing!
- Shut up, Janet!

56:50.560 --> 56:52.551
Go get in a cooking class!

56:52.760 --> 56:55.911
She's a sissy! Hurry up and get it over with.

56:57.640 --> 57:00.632
- Strike two!
- Come on, Mathilda!

57:00.840 --> 57:06.358
Lawrence is crazy about her,
but she won't give him the time of day.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.120
She's not thinking of that stuff yet.

57:09.320 --> 57:11.151
Here we go, girl!

57:22.560 --> 57:25.996
Go back! You're going the wrong way!

57:26.200 --> 57:28.031
Dang!

57:28.240 --> 57:31.550
The other way, not that way!

57:42.960 --> 57:45.520
Yes, Mathilda! We lost, we lost!

57:55.280 --> 57:58.556
- Good game, kid.
- Good spectatoring, Pops.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.320
I'm taking this to the Newlands tomorrow.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.437
Can I go? I'm dying to see inside.
They have gold salt shakers!

58:06.640 --> 58:09.757
Just 'cause ours are linoleum,
don't put them down.

58:09.960 --> 58:13.270
- And they have a butler!
- And he's English.

58:13.480 --> 58:16.472
Mr Newland rings a bell and the butler goes,

58:16.680 --> 58:19.717
"Tea, suh? Tea?"

58:21.240 --> 58:24.152
- OK, you can go.
- Thanks, Pop!

58:27.680 --> 58:34.518
We'll let them manipulate Fred, swap his
vote later down the line on the tax credit.

58:34.720 --> 58:38.872
- We want a yes vote from you, right?
- All right.

58:39.080 --> 58:44.393
You'll get a call from that son of a bitch
Ballards on your vote on the farm thing.

58:44.600 --> 58:49.469
Play along, say anything.
You'll flip-flop at the last minute.

58:49.680 --> 58:52.433
He won't have enough votes if you wait.

58:52.640 --> 58:58.875
John, we're having difficulty getting
permission to divert water from the quarry.

58:59.080 --> 59:01.640
- No, you're not.
- Yes, we are.

59:01.840 --> 59:06.516
You don't understand. We are not.
Not if you want the yes vote.

59:28.080 --> 59:32.710
We're going to divert the water
from the quarry here.

59:34.280 --> 59:37.716
It'll go down through the valley
to form a lake.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.753
We'll sell the property for development.

59:40.960 --> 59:45.795
But there's a beautiful spot here
that I thought would be a real nice place

59:46.000 --> 59:48.673
for you and me... to build a little house.

59:48.880 --> 59:52.077
So we can go live next to a bunch of ducks?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.919
John?

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.396
You gotta snap out of this.
You're sleepwalking.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.957
- Mr McCann is here with the delivery.
- Thank you, Esther.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.318
Hello, Michael. Hi, Mathilda.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.308
- Hello, Mrs Newland.
- I hope you don't mind me bringing her.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.956
No problem.
Mathilda, would you like to come in?

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.276
Thank you, Mrs Newland.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.399
- Are you thirsty?
- No, Ma'am.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.874
OK.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.030
- That's by Andrew Wyatt!
- Yes, it is.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.316
Have you seen this picture?

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.512
That's how the house
used to look in the old days.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:13.349
That man there - that's my grandfather.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.836
And that little boy beside him -
that's my father.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.156
Dad, books on horses!

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.074
- Would you like to see the real horses?
- Yes, sir!

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.068
- If it's not too much trouble.
- No, of course it's not.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.719
Tea, suh?

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.719
Dad, look!

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.595
- Sit straight. Hold the reins.
- OK.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.439
Here she comes! Annie Oakley!

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.234
- I'll get the camera.
- Fastest gal this town's ever seen!

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.634
Michael...

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:11.994
she is having such a great time out there.
She has a real passion for horses.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.593
I was thinking of inviting her up here
for some lessons, if that's OK with you?

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.155
- She'd love that.
- Can I tell her?

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.272
Be my guest, and... thank you.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.550
Dad, it's time!

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.318
OK, take off.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.040
Remind me to cut that hole bigger.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.636
You... are... done.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.671
Let's see. Yes!

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.872
That looks good! Food coming
out of your mouth, that looks good!

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:16.153
Look at me, Mr Newland!

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.113
I'm sorry.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.359
- Sorry for what?
- Sorry I couldn't give you what you want.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.950
When you look at her,
I know how you feel.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.833
I'm sorry I couldn't give you this.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:44.190
Look, Nancy, it's all done.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.595
No, it's not.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.475
We can have a family.
Why don't you think about adopting?

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:53.752
This isn't something I want to discuss now.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.952
Don't turn away. Excuse us, please!

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:05.354
Adopted children, they... they become
your own children.

01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:09.437
Look at the Greens.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.399
- Look at Michael McCann.
- He has her because of me.

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:20.550
I know! You helped him. Why you won't
help yourself, I'll never know!

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.274
That's not what I mean, Nancy.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:30.030
Michael McCann has her because of me.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.430
What are you saying?

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:48.030
Are you saying Mathilda is your daughter?!

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.393
I thought I could be strong.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.755
Just having her in the house, I...

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:00.116
Nancy, the woman who died
in the snow was her mother...

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:06.873
I thought it was strange how you seemed
so close to Mathilda. Now I understand!

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:09.552
- Nancy!
- Don't.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.233
Don't!

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.313
Mathilda...

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.794
Hi.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.319
Did you have fun?

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.519
I did.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.152
- Do you like it here?
- I love it.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.114
Good.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.477
- Well... bye.
- Bye.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.190
There have been times
when I have wanted to leave.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:12.079
After we lost the second child, I thought
I was bringing you too much pain.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:19.275
But then I thought that someone else
might bring you children,

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.153
but pain in some other way.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:28.475
If I had told anybody back then,
I would have been ruined politically.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.229
And if I had told you...

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.278
I know that you would not
have stayed with me.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.508
If you had taken her, she would
have known me as her mother!

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.158
And you... you would have been
happier with me!

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:55.116
Our lives would have been more
like we thought they would be!

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.029
I see it all now...

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.675
...ten years too late.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.352
What?

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.519
I chose the wrong door.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:26.072
You are her natural father.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.159
You are her father!

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:55.388
What you are doing is very good.
Ask her over as much as possible.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.956
Let her get used to first-class.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.754
Have you given it any thought?

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.669
This is how we get everyone behind us.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.668
They all want to win the lottery
and this kid can.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:14.795
If she goes from beggar to princess,
we'll even have McCann believing it.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.198
So all our money
may finally have some use.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.470
- Hey, how're you doing?
- Hi.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.117
- Are you... are you ready to ride?
- Oh, yeah.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:43.158
Now, which of these guys
do you like the best?

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.875
- The grey one.
- Well, you can have him.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.028
- Huh?
- He's yours.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.796
Holy smokes!

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.312
You can come up here
and ride him any time you want,

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.353
and you can call him whatever you want.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.630
Do you have a name in mind?

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:17.073
I'll have to do some research,
but Sparkle immediately comes to mind.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:19.475
Whatever you want, he's yours.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:26.073
Oh, by the way, I think maybe
we should keep this to ourselves.

01:09:26.279 --> 01:09:28.635
- How come?
- Just as our secret.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.627
- Why?
- Tell your dad if you want,

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.960
but parents can be kinda funny
about things like this.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.957
Really?

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:47.747
- Hey, just in time for nachos.
- I'm full.

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:55.880
I think we should talk.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.555
Already I don't like it.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:04.435
I think maybe you shouldn't go
to the Newlands so much.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.679
- Why?
- Well... you live here.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.111
And, you can overstay your welcome.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.276
- But they invite me.
- I know,

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.349
but it is possible to abuse a situation
without realising it.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:23.553
- I wanna go. It's not hurting anyone.
- Not so much or so often!

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.671
I'm going!

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.475
- Look, just don't be greedy!
- Look who's talking!

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.831
What do you mean?

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.793
Judy's dad said that you were a miser.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.949
That you loved money so much you kept it
in your own house so you could look at it!

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.550
It was stolen
because you wouldn't put it in the bank!

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.150
- You're not going up there again!
- Yes, I am!

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.559
Couldn't have written it better yourself.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.796
I did write it myself.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.994
- She's definitely good.
- She's fine.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.675
- She's good.
- Real good.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.429
She hates me right now,
but she'll get over it.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.952
Sure, five, six years, therapy,
Prozac shaped like Flintstones.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.151
She doesn't mean it.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:36.114
I think she's being scouted. See this guy?

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.551
He's been around.
I think he's a sports scout.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.274
He is coming this way.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.518
- That your daughter?
- Quite a talent, eh?

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:53.032
- You're Michael McCann?
- And I represent her.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.596
You are served.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.073
Problem.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.193
I thought I was the victim
of my own greed and ambition.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.914
You are not getting her!

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.157
I'd have thought you'd want
what was best for her!

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.635
You are not getting her!

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.072
She is my child.
That is profoundly unchangeable.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.115
If you love her so much, why did you
turn your back on her ten years ago?!

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:44.831
It's inevitable! You can fight this
or you can accept it,

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.999
but given time, she'll prefer
her real father and this family!

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.034
It's me she's been calling Daddy
ever since she could speak!

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.196
Oh, God!

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.510
Hello, Mathilda.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.832
Mr Newland is my real father?

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.758
Yes, he is.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:12.309
Would you like to come
and live here with us, Mathilda?

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.318
I don't know what I'm supposed to say!

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.158
When you turn a gift away from your door,

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:45.717
it... it goes to the one that takes it in.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.999
Dad?

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.313
Where was my mother buried?

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.551
I don't know. We never knew
where she was taken.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.990
Why not?!

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.476
I was afraid.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:41.516
I was afraid that they might find a relative
or your father,

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:44.314
someone who might take you away from me.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.593
- One day I'd like to know where she is.
- We could do that.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.951
Mrs Simon can find anything
on her computer.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.157
Just a minute.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:34.235
This... was your mother's
and you should have it.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.914
I mean, it's you and her, isn't it?

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:54.989
You're my parents, you and Mom,
not the Newlands!

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.510
I'll fix you a drink...
I'll make you some juice.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:14.717
Do you know what it means
that he's your real father?

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:18.674
Do you... you know,
understand how babies are made?

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:35.115
This fairy tale story of the little match girl
who discovered she's a princess.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.878
Let's get some opinions.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.640
How can he take care of her like them?

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.678
She'll see him,
but she'll live in a better house.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.269
Kinda like me and my ex-husband.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.870
So that's six for and four against.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.878
Cast your vote on 9-10-REALDAD.

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.039
This is WAPB. We bring you
Other People's Business.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.238
Mrs Latham, you're principal
at Gardner's School,

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.079
- where Mathilda Newland attends?
- Yes.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.716
- Mathilda Newland?
- He's trying to get your goat.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:14.995
As a teacher, has this child the potential
to attend a college like Harvard or Yale?

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.634
Mathilda has unlimited potential.

01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:20.673
Do you know what it costs to attend them?

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.677
Lots, I suppose.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:27.715
Wait till he gets me up there.
Thinks he's getting little Aunt Mildred.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.229
He's getting Aunt Attila the Hun!

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.715
The court calls Mrs April Simon.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.435
Please raise your right hand.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.676
Do you swear to tell the truth,

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.793
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.389
You bet your boots.

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:59.309
He's a great father. He's caring.
He thinks of nothing but that child.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.230
And he's no ordinary father.
He's original, he's creative.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.150
- He's very unconventional.
- Unconventional? How?

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.716
- What?
- How is he unconventional?

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:17.152
Well, when Mathilda was a toddler,
to keep an eye on her,

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.874
he'd tie her up with a red ribbon.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.789
- That was hilarious.
- What? Tie her up?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.118
Not tie her up. Just tie her to a table leg
so he could watch her.

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.950
To a table leg. Could the ribbon have
become entangled round her neck?

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.991
No, it was tied round here.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.558
- Not exactly the latest in parenting?
- No, but that's my point...

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.595
Perhaps you could tell us other things
Mr McCann does that are different?

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.756
When she was learning to read,

01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:52.192
he told her not to read the school books,
but to read adult books.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:57.110
- He wouldn't let her read school books?
- Because she didn't want to.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.198
So, he let her read adult books?

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.995
Yes, right. No, not adult books!

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.115
May I be excused, please?

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.392
Thank you, Mrs Simon. That's all.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.676
- I'm sorry!
- It's OK.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:23.839
- Mrs Simon, you're not done yet.
- Oh, shit!

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.632
Excuse me.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.399
- No questions.
- I don't blame you.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.393
Stone Lake!

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.352
Stone Lake!

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.950
That'll sure quench your thirst!

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:44.472
- Can I talk to you?
- I'd like nothing more.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.196
Who are you?!

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:04.713
That's the best question anybody has
thought to ask me since this thing started.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:12.229
I'm your real father.
Not the best father, I know that.

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:18.515
Not as good a father as Michael has been
to you up till now, but I know I can be.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.035
See, I made a mistake a long time ago,

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.994
which I will regret for the rest of my life.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.191
That's why I'm fighting for you.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:33.154
I know you think I'm hateful,
but I have to take that chance.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.158
What was my mother like?

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.920
Your mother loved you, Mathilda.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.676
And I love you, too.

01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.719
- How did you treat my mother?
- As best I could. I never hurt her.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.036
I respected her.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.754
We just weren't meant for each other.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.829
But she took drugs.
You've heard how bad that can be.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.314
Mmm.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.596
Do you think that...

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:14.874
...you could ever live here?

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.558
Sometimes.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:41.394
Mr Newland, will you read the signature

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.912
at the bottom of this hospital
admittance form for a Marsha Swanson?

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.395
Marsha Swanson.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.194
- Mr Henry Swanson.
- Who is Henry Swanson?

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.518
I am. I mean, I signed this paper
using a different name.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.517
- It's your writing?
- Yes.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:02.430
I came to an arrangement with the mother
to pay her a monthly sum of money

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.278
and it would be our secret.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.357
Why did she agree?

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:11.111
- Because she was a drug addict.
- And you? What were you?

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.879
I was young, foolish and... I was afraid.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.753
Looking back, you see how foolish you were?

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.632
I do.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.798
No further questions. Your witness.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.073
The night the child walked
into Mr McCann's house, you were there?

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.669
- Yes, I was.
- Yet you said nothing?

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.431
- I felt the child needed...
- Answer the question. You said nothing?

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.392
Yes.

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.114
By failing to claim your daughter then,

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.312
- you did not fulfil your rights.
- Objection.

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.512
- Assumes facts not of evidence.
- Sustained.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.313
Mr Newland, you did not act as a father?
You did not comfort her or hold her?

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.034
- Things a father might do.
- No.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.519
So, your feelings for your future wife
and career mattered more than your child?

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:10.236
Yes, but since that time I have made sure
she was safe in this community

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:13.591
where I could make sure
she was taken care of.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.155
Oh, you're breaking our hearts!

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.471
- Why did you see the mother secretly?
- I think it's obvious.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.990
Obvious to you, maybe,
but why don't you tell us.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.557
At the time, she was not someone
I was proud to be seen with.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.433
- Because you were in politics?
- Yes.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:36.837
- Better to lie to the public?
- That's not it.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.996
I made a mistake, I admit that!

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.556
You have to admit it
to look like a man with remorse.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.799
So, you paid her off to get
this embarrassment out of your life?

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.232
She was out of control!
Addicts only care about themselves!

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.229
Thank you, Mr Newland.

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:58.000
The witness may step down.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.430
Call Michael McCann to the stand.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.436
I've had enough of these stories!

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.996
My only hope is that the two dads
murder each other.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.998
May I ask what you earn a year?

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.509
Around $15,000.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.837
How did you plan to send her to school?

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.998
There are scholarships. I can borrow.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.512
I've always been there for her in the past
and I believe I will be then.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.840
I have a belief, too. I believe that if she
were the responsibility of Mr Newland,

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.396
she would without a doubt
attend the best schools,

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:38.068
without a doubt be able to travel,

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.431
be given the opportunities
she deserves!

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.474
- Objection! Where's the question?
- Sustained. Get to the verb.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.514
- You feel John Newland abandoned her?
- Yes.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:57.635
It sounds terrible when you leave out
the details, the circumstances.

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.515
I admit it sounds bad
when you leave out the details.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.314
You were married once, weren't you?

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.759
Yes.

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:12.715
And you left that marriage
while your wife was pregnant.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.959
She...

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.435
Please answer the question only.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.235
- There were special circumstances...
- Yes or no?

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:23.998
Objection!

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.994
Yes.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.398
In fairness, Mr McCann,
there were circumstances

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.275
that made you guiltless
when you abandoned that child.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.554
Just as, in Mr Newland's case,
any reasonable person would understand

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.910
why he did what he did.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.918
That is why we have to understand what
kind of a man John Newland was then.

01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:01.240
And it makes me wonder
what kind of a man you were then.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.594
Mr McCann, I'm going to say some words.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:12.558
If you feel these words inaccurately describe
you at times in your life, please stop me.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.273
Poor...

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.798
...reclusive...

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.679
...unfriendly...

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.438
...miserly...

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:25.792
...angry...

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.319
...lonely...

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.237
Lonely.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:37.149
Were you lonely enough to seize a child
to ease your selfish pain?

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.635
Lonely enough to bend the law,

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:45.039
to collaborate in stopping the process
of finding a suitable home for this child?

01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:49.313
- I wonder how much you were in on this!
- Objection!

01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:51.636
I've finished, Your Honour!

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.636
And so is he.

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.353
Stand down.

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.152
- Hi, Mathilda.
- Hi.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.556
- How are you?
- Not so good.

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.479
How is your horse?

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:37.476
How's Sparkle?

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:40.673
I don't know.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.791
Tell us how you got Sparkle.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.790
Mr Newland gave him to me.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.468
And you accepted it?

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:51.999
Yes.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:54.760
- Did you tell your dad?
- No.

01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:00.952
So you had a secret gift from your real
father and you didn't tell Mr McCann?

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.639
Yes.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:07.231
So, you might say you had a special
relationship with your real father

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:10.591
you were afraid to tell Mr McCann about?

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.631
I wasn't afraid.

01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:16.355
But you didn't tell him
about your real dad's gift?

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.959
No.

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.396
Thank you, Mathilda.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.478
I have no further questions, Your Honour.

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.356
- Do you like being called Mathilda Newland?
- It's not me.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:33.711
- How would you like to be known?
- Mathilda McCann!

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:36.992
Point to the man you think of
as your father.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.275
And what is Mr Newland to you?

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.835
I used to think of him as a nice man.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.519
How do you see him now?

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:51.110
As someone trying
to take me away from my father.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:56.553
How would you feel, Mathilda, if you were
separated from your father?

01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.994
I... l...

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.999
I could never be separated from him!

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.317
He's the one who has taken care of me!

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.873
He's the one who has inspired me!

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.200
Now I'm entering my years of womanhood,
I'll need his guidance even more!

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.075
I could never be anything
without my loving Daddy!

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.671
I wanna be an actress!

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.154
Ssh!

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.874
You'd better go to school.

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.719
Too good, Pops, you and me!

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.592
You and me.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.074
I didn't tell you about the horse.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.511
I should have, but I wanted it.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.836
I know you did.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.953
- There's a problem, though.
- What's that?

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.958
I still want it.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:52.038
I've got a headache!

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.151
So you should!

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:58.239
I can't believe I have to give it
to that son of a bitch!

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:02.069
Baloney! You'd sell your mother for cat food.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.832
- Do something right for once.
- I can't go against Newland.

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:14.397
There's too much, father to father
and now son to son.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.034
How can I ask her to live in squalor?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.959
I can't give her to McCann
without a powerful reason.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.148
A powerful reason.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.276
Court will come to order.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.390
I have come to a decision.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:51.312
But first, I'll explain my thinking and
you'll see what a difficult decision it was.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:56.632
We have a man who has raised a child
as if she were his own.

01:32:56.840 --> 01:32:59.798
Generously and lovingly.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.597
The child has been well brought up, not
something easy to do in today's world.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:10.669
I would like to explain what it was
that tipped the balance.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:16.398
That something was not concerning her
happiness. That's impossible to quantify.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.628
I'm very clearly directed to look
at the welfare of the child,

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.755
which can be very coldly calculated
in terms of money.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.794
She will need money
for her education and protection.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:40.998
It would be irresponsible of me
to deny this child her natural claim

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.998
to the wealth which is offered to her.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.350
If it were...

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:52.476
otherwise so, believe me, not only
would I be inclined to go the other way,

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.877
but my heart would want it that way.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.188
What is going on out there?!

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:07.155
Come here, boy!

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.316
Come here!

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.917
Let's go and see.
Court is recessed for one hour.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.236
- All rise.
- To hell with that. Go.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:29.517
Apparently, we were waiting for a verdict,
when a young boy... Here he is!

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.517
Young man...

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:37.880
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.553
Bingo!

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.672
As a judge, I'm always interested
in the exact moment

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.997
when someone's argument falls apart.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.076
Sorry about what happened
to your brother, Mr Newland.

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:33.838
Thank you.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:37.873
Mathilda?

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:49.756
I'll see you around.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.878
We get a few folks like you each year,

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:28.071
looking for someone.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.669
Everybody's looking for someone.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.075
And this is the last place they look.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.791
That's for sure.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.434
The last place they look.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.440
Right over there, folks.
