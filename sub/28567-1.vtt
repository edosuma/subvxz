03:52.542 --> 03:54.026
Good morning, babe.

03:54.061 --> 03:55.061
Mm.

03:56.719 --> 03:57.823
Morning darling.

03:57.858 --> 03:59.584
Daddy!

03:59.618 --> 04:02.380
Oh!

04:02.414 --> 04:05.624
Momma said that when
my tooth falls out,

04:05.659 --> 04:07.350
the tooth fairy will
give me some money.

04:07.385 --> 04:08.696
What?

04:08.731 --> 04:10.491
Is that true?

04:10.526 --> 04:11.492
Really, Momma said that?

04:11.527 --> 04:12.804
Mm-hmm.

04:12.838 --> 04:14.046
Yes, it is true.

04:14.081 --> 04:18.913
I want to help you buy
the house in Thailand.

04:19.776 --> 04:21.399
Oh, you want to help me?

04:21.433 --> 04:23.090
You hear that?
- I do hear that.

04:23.124 --> 04:24.723
I think that's a good deal.

04:24.747 --> 04:25.989
I do, too.

04:26.024 --> 04:28.440
Alright, let me
take a look at it.

04:28.475 --> 04:29.924
Hello?

04:29.959 --> 04:30.994
Oh.

04:31.029 --> 04:32.029
Hello?

04:33.652 --> 04:34.550
Hello?

04:34.584 --> 04:36.483
Oh, it's very unstable.

04:39.555 --> 04:42.454
But it's worth a few bucks.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.090
That was the fourth
time this morning.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.886
Okay, what does
your day look like?

05:00.921 --> 05:02.474
I have a class this morning.

05:02.509 --> 05:04.718
Then meetings all day long.

05:06.513 --> 05:09.585
Okay, I'm taking Sophie
to school in a bit,

05:09.619 --> 05:13.071
and then I'm going grocery
shopping, and then Sophie has...

05:13.105 --> 05:15.522
Yes, yes, ballet tonight.

05:15.556 --> 05:17.662
I'm guessing I'm the
one picking her up too.

05:19.940 --> 05:21.148
Please?

05:21.182 --> 05:23.495
Don't
give me that face.

05:23.530 --> 05:25.083
- Please.
- Stop it.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.465
You're dirty, you're dirty.

05:28.569 --> 05:29.743
Thank you.

05:29.777 --> 05:30.777
Thank you.

06:19.517 --> 06:23.417
Honey, I need
money for groceries.

06:34.704 --> 06:37.742
Are you gonna play
tooth fairy tonight?

06:38.708 --> 06:39.708
I'll try.

06:40.710 --> 06:42.574
. Make sure you have
a good day, okay?

06:51.790 --> 06:53.999
And remember who loves you.

07:13.674 --> 07:16.125
Greetings and salutations.

07:16.159 --> 07:17.159
Greetings.

07:18.127 --> 07:19.922
Hello.

07:19.956 --> 07:21.233
You must be Mr. McQueen.

07:23.132 --> 07:24.271
Mrs. Hanson?

07:24.305 --> 07:25.790
Please, call me Lizzy.

08:04.242 --> 08:07.935
Ellis Construction's
assets in part use of value.

08:07.970 --> 08:11.663
Well, after
reading the report,

08:11.698 --> 08:13.803
I say we dismantle the
rest of those products,

08:15.356 --> 08:17.566
but we keep the parts
of Ellis Construction

08:17.600 --> 08:20.292
that can excel our growth
and make us profitable.

08:22.709 --> 08:23.882
Micro fiber chips.

08:28.956 --> 08:29.956
Sir?

08:32.304 --> 08:33.202
Sir?

08:36.274 --> 08:37.274
Yeah, sorry.

08:39.139 --> 08:41.106
Run that, that last
part by me again

08:41.140 --> 08:43.073
the part about growth.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.660
Satnam.

09:29.223 --> 09:30.742
Satnam.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.789
Satnam.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.729
If any of you would like
some private classes,

09:51.763 --> 09:53.869
please make sure that you put

09:53.903 --> 09:54.697
on the form.
- Hot yoga?

09:54.732 --> 09:55.767
Hot yoga as well.

09:55.802 --> 09:56.951
I wrote my number on the form.

09:56.975 --> 09:58.977
Do you do also
more intense classes?

09:59.012 --> 10:01.186
It depends on the need
of the person, you know.

10:01.221 --> 10:02.360
Whatever you need, you know,

10:02.394 --> 10:03.682
I can provide.
- Thank you so much.

10:03.706 --> 10:04.983
- Thank you.
- I appreciate you.

10:05.018 --> 10:06.236
Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.365
- Thank you.
- Saturday.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.746
Okay, thank you.

10:08.780 --> 10:09.885
Thank you.

10:09.919 --> 10:10.713
Thank you very much.

10:10.748 --> 10:11.714
Okay, my Instagram.

10:11.749 --> 10:12.819
Your Instagram is there?

10:12.853 --> 10:14.303
- Yeah.
- Okay, beautiful.

10:14.337 --> 10:16.892
Alright, everybody put
their email address, yeah?

10:16.926 --> 10:18.238
- Yeah.
- And their numbers?

10:18.272 --> 10:20.654
- Right there.
- Okay, I appreciate you.

10:20.689 --> 10:21.310
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

10:21.344 --> 10:22.311
Thank you so much.

10:22.345 --> 10:23.968
Thank you again.
- We'll see you.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.901
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you, yes.

10:39.224 --> 10:41.399
Would you
like some water?

10:41.433 --> 10:42.433
Yes, please.

10:44.402 --> 10:46.715
These pictures are beautiful.

10:46.749 --> 10:48.820
You have a good eye.

10:48.855 --> 10:49.856
Thank you.

10:49.890 --> 10:52.306
It's been a while since
I picked the camera up.

10:54.481 --> 10:55.931
Haven't really been inspired.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.970
Did you
do this one as well?

11:03.835 --> 11:04.835
I did.

11:05.872 --> 11:07.252
It's not my usual style though.

11:09.807 --> 11:10.842
Interesting.

11:40.561 --> 11:41.561
Yeah?

11:43.012 --> 11:45.359
Sir, you have a
Mr. Plaxton here to see you.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.054
Okay, send him in, Marsha.

12:00.167 --> 12:01.341
Mr. Hanson.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.825
I have another
meeting in a minute,

12:02.860 --> 12:04.931
so can we keep this brief?

12:04.965 --> 12:06.967
Yes sir, no problem.

12:09.936 --> 12:13.491
Mea Culpa Apartments,
Apartment 111, two days ago.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.261
Again, Apartment 111.

12:26.228 --> 12:27.505
Same two days every week.

12:29.956 --> 12:32.234
She block booked the place.

12:32.268 --> 12:34.823
She's at it for a
couple of months now.

12:34.857 --> 12:35.857
Paid cash.

12:38.965 --> 12:41.346
They should be meeting tonight.

12:48.595 --> 12:49.734
Alright.

12:49.769 --> 12:54.118
Well, as I said I do have
another meeting in a minute,

12:54.152 --> 12:57.915
so thank you, Mr. Plaxton,
we'll be in touch.

13:00.987 --> 13:03.127
Everything's on
that pen drive.

13:03.161 --> 13:06.337
I also got the photos you
requested of the other two women.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.205
Great, thank you.

13:26.322 --> 13:27.876
Hey, dear.

13:27.910 --> 13:28.910
McQueen.

13:31.534 --> 13:32.950
- So good to see you.
- You too.

13:32.984 --> 13:34.917
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

13:38.472 --> 13:41.993
No, not now later, thank you.

13:42.028 --> 13:43.926
Hello, Mr. McQueen.

14:00.011 --> 14:01.116
How you feeling?

14:01.150 --> 14:02.358
On top of the world.

14:02.393 --> 14:04.119
Like I always am
when I'm with you.

14:04.153 --> 14:06.535
You're gonna see
me Tuesday, right?

14:06.569 --> 14:07.985
Like I just told you today,

14:08.019 --> 14:10.470
you have to give
it three months.

14:10.504 --> 14:11.930
So, you don't
wanna see me anymore?

14:11.954 --> 14:16.441
No, listen you're
in a positive place.

14:16.476 --> 14:18.340
This is the best
you've ever been.

14:18.374 --> 14:20.204
What if I regress?

14:20.238 --> 14:21.550
Remember to yourself.

14:22.723 --> 14:25.140
Beauty and age are
only in the mind?

14:26.037 --> 14:27.073
Correct.

14:41.087 --> 14:45.022
Why don't we start
with the painting?

14:45.056 --> 14:46.092
The painting?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.510
The painting is just a painting.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.178
You know, every
beautiful thing

14:53.202 --> 14:56.240
has some kind of hidden pain.

14:57.724 --> 14:58.724
What's yours?

15:00.106 --> 15:01.141
Well, there's none.

15:03.178 --> 15:04.213
It's just a painting.

15:05.594 --> 15:07.216
Is it how you see yourself?

15:09.218 --> 15:11.117
Hidden in plain sight?

15:46.083 --> 15:47.256
Yeah?

15:47.291 --> 15:49.189
You see those
pictures of Esther?

15:50.190 --> 15:51.226
Yeah.

15:52.261 --> 15:54.643
Well, I know where
he'll be tonight.

15:54.677 --> 15:55.677
You still down?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.650
Family should stick together.

16:05.274 --> 16:06.448
Fine, count me in.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.175
You're sure?

16:09.209 --> 16:10.209
Yeah.

16:11.246 --> 16:12.246
Good.

16:13.213 --> 16:14.352
Then we're on for tonight.

16:25.122 --> 16:27.158
Good afternoon,
Ellis Construction.

16:27.193 --> 16:28.401
It's me did you get it?

16:31.162 --> 16:33.233
Yeah, give me a minute.

16:43.657 --> 16:44.796
You satisfied?

16:57.223 --> 16:58.810
I gotta go call you right back.

17:01.227 --> 17:02.538
Shit!

17:02.573 --> 17:04.126
Fuck!

17:11.202 --> 17:13.204
665 grand?

17:13.239 --> 17:16.276
That's
right, sir, $665,000.

17:16.310 --> 17:17.346
Thank you.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.590
She withdrew that
this afternoon?

17:20.625 --> 17:22.281
Yes, Mr.
Hanson, in cash.

17:22.317 --> 17:23.594
Uh-huh.

17:23.627 --> 17:27.218
Alright, well, thanks
for keeping me informed.

17:27.252 --> 17:28.392
I appreciate it.

17:28.425 --> 17:29.817
Is there anything
else I can help you with?

17:29.841 --> 17:32.327
No, that's
it for now, thank you.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.167
Thank you for banking
with First American Bank,

17:34.191 --> 17:36.848
Mr. Hanson, make sure
you have a very good day.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.683
My doctor thinks the reason

17:43.717 --> 17:46.065
I can't conceive
is psychological.

17:50.517 --> 17:53.486
Your mind has to
arrive at its destination

17:54.866 --> 17:56.696
before your body does.

17:59.630 --> 18:01.770
My husband wants a child now.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.258
And you what do you want?

18:12.850 --> 18:16.336
A child with someone
I can connect with.

18:36.874 --> 18:37.874
Lizzy.

18:40.981 --> 18:41.981
Lizzy.

18:47.885 --> 18:48.885
Lizzy.

18:50.612 --> 18:52.786
Sweetheart, is that you?

18:55.513 --> 18:57.205
You're home early.

18:58.689 --> 19:01.312
Yeah, I had to come
back and get a few things.

19:01.347 --> 19:02.624
You having a little bath?

19:02.658 --> 19:04.902
I had a class at the gym.

19:09.424 --> 19:11.253
Okay, enjoy.

21:32.601 --> 21:33.601
You okay?

21:35.155 --> 21:36.155
Yeah.

21:37.537 --> 21:39.677
You know, I never
realized before how

21:41.438 --> 21:43.094
clearly you can see
things from here.

22:26.103 --> 22:27.898
You look beautiful, Mrs. Hanson.

22:31.522 --> 22:36.527
Hey, why don't we
go out tonight, huh?

22:37.735 --> 22:39.415
Go do something or go
dancing at the Grand?

22:40.980 --> 22:45.950
Come back here afterwards
and maybe we can try again?

22:47.814 --> 22:50.576
Most fertile the
next few days, right?

22:54.614 --> 22:55.822
It's girls' night tonight.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.725
Maybe we can do
that tomorrow night,

23:02.898 --> 23:04.186
and then come back
here and try again.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.210
Sure.

23:11.769 --> 23:15.117
I left a plate of food
in the fridge for you.

23:15.152 --> 23:17.741
I'll probably just grab
something on the way home.

23:23.022 --> 23:24.748
I've gotta go.

23:24.782 --> 23:25.782
Okay.

23:26.681 --> 23:27.923
I'll see you.

23:48.737 --> 23:50.567
I love you, Lizzy Hanson.

23:55.917 --> 23:58.229
I love you, Richie Hanson.

25:18.102 --> 25:20.864
Hey, hey, hey, my queens.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.210
Hey babe.

25:22.244 --> 25:24.143
Sophie just got into bed,

25:24.177 --> 25:26.041
and she wanted to
tell you goodnight.

25:27.629 --> 25:28.906
- Alright.
- Daddy.

25:28.941 --> 25:31.046
My tooth just fell out.

25:31.081 --> 25:32.841
I was a brave girl.

25:33.739 --> 25:34.947
She was.

25:36.707 --> 25:37.846
That's my girl.

25:37.881 --> 25:41.678
When is the tooth fairy
gonna come with my money?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.680
When you go to bed.

25:43.714 --> 25:45.682
You have to fall
asleep first, okay?

25:45.716 --> 25:46.821
So, now go to bed.

25:48.063 --> 25:49.996
Goodnight, love you.

25:50.031 --> 25:52.033
Goodnight, I love you.

25:53.413 --> 25:54.413
Mm-hmm.

25:55.864 --> 25:57.763
So, how's the
schedule looking?

25:57.797 --> 26:00.282
I'm down to my
last client now,

26:00.317 --> 26:04.666
so I might come home early
in three or four hours.

26:04.701 --> 26:06.323
I'll see you then.

26:56.442 --> 26:57.685
So.

27:02.413 --> 27:03.932
Here's the plan.

28:57.597 --> 28:59.772
Reported
that the old fire hall

28:59.807 --> 29:00.956
is still burning out of control.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.982
There are no
reports of injuries,

29:03.017 --> 29:05.295
but a three block area
has been evacuated.

29:06.468 --> 29:08.229
And to business the stock market

29:08.263 --> 29:09.989
fell through the floor today.

29:10.024 --> 29:11.439
No one seems to
have predicted this,

29:11.473 --> 29:13.855
so it's hard to know
where it's heading.

29:21.967 --> 29:23.831
Stay in the moment.

29:30.389 --> 29:31.389
Breathe.

29:51.928 --> 29:55.552
That's it.

29:55.586 --> 29:56.586
That's it.

30:00.108 --> 30:01.108
And drink.

30:38.698 --> 30:40.159
Police in
Canada have smashed up

30:40.183 --> 30:42.599
a multi-million dollar
drug smuggling ring.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.635
Police say the raid was
centered in Columbia

30:44.670 --> 30:47.466
with drugs finding their
way into large city centers.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.641
25 people have been arrested,
and face charges ranging from

30:50.676 --> 30:51.998
distributing to possession

30:52.022 --> 30:54.507
for the purpose of trafficking.

31:05.691 --> 31:07.935
His
legs, get his legs!

31:07.969 --> 31:08.969
Shit!

31:17.427 --> 31:18.359
Hey!

31:46.352 --> 31:47.940
When we have our answers,

31:47.975 --> 31:49.355
we will have our revenge.

31:49.390 --> 31:51.357
I want this guy in a grave.

31:51.392 --> 31:52.634
Mm.

31:52.669 --> 31:54.222
He's
awake sit him up.

32:08.064 --> 32:09.962
Who are you?

32:11.343 --> 32:13.414
What do you want from me?

32:25.564 --> 32:27.255
Where's the bag?

32:28.360 --> 32:30.224
I'll get it.

32:34.228 --> 32:35.229
Here you go.

32:39.785 --> 32:42.339
What do
you want from me?

32:42.374 --> 32:43.616
Huh?

32:43.651 --> 32:44.963
Oh, yeah.

32:50.175 --> 32:51.970
No, no, no.

32:54.317 --> 32:55.318
Who are you?

32:59.598 --> 33:01.117
Who are you?

33:03.843 --> 33:06.156
No, no, no, no., no, no.

33:08.641 --> 33:11.161
Why are you doing this, huh?

33:17.650 --> 33:19.549
Ha, ha!

33:21.171 --> 33:23.070
You know what even
this piece of shit

33:23.104 --> 33:24.416
doesn't deserve to be punched.

33:26.142 --> 33:27.488
You little fuck!

33:30.663 --> 33:33.149
How you feeling
now asshole, huh?

33:40.604 --> 33:44.574
I wanna see his dick.

33:46.369 --> 33:47.369
What?

33:49.682 --> 33:51.029
Yeah, I wanna.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.724
I wanna see his dick.

34:09.737 --> 34:12.498
Shit.

34:12.533 --> 34:13.533
Oh, shit.

34:14.672 --> 34:16.399
You know what, here.

34:16.433 --> 34:17.676
Take a look at mine.

34:28.273 --> 34:30.170
Alright,
that's enough!

34:57.647 --> 34:59.545
I want your PIN number.

35:01.340 --> 35:02.514
I'm gonna remove the tape,

35:03.963 --> 35:06.759
and you're gonna tell me your
PIN number, you understand?

35:13.352 --> 35:15.192
My patience are
running thin with you.

35:15.216 --> 35:16.390
What's that fucking PIN?

35:16.424 --> 35:17.425
Take it easy.

35:22.327 --> 35:26.296
You gonna behave and
tell me your PIN number?

35:42.726 --> 35:43.726
So,

35:46.282 --> 35:47.593
what is the PIN number?

35:53.461 --> 35:55.325
What do you want from me?

35:56.361 --> 35:58.328
This is a felony, you know that.

36:01.366 --> 36:03.402
Let me go, and I
won't press charges.

36:03.437 --> 36:08.407
What is the
fucking PIN number?

36:15.449 --> 36:16.760
69-11-69.

36:56.352 --> 36:57.974
You
waiting for someone?

37:11.470 --> 37:13.679
You're sleeping with my wife?

37:19.858 --> 37:21.515
No, I'm not.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.521
Hey!

37:28.798 --> 37:30.386
He's figured out who I am.

37:32.526 --> 37:33.768
And now I want the truth.

37:39.498 --> 37:41.500
Are you fucking my wife?

37:50.647 --> 37:52.097
Grab his head.

37:52.131 --> 37:53.857
What?

37:53.892 --> 37:54.824
Grab his head!

37:54.858 --> 37:55.858
What?

37:58.483 --> 37:59.587
No, no, no, no!

37:59.622 --> 38:01.348
No, no!

38:05.386 --> 38:06.801
No!

38:06.836 --> 38:08.389
Stop it, stop it!

38:09.770 --> 38:10.633
Stop, stop, stop!

38:10.667 --> 38:11.565
No!

38:11.599 --> 38:13.049
Alright, that's enough!

38:14.499 --> 38:16.501
- We agreed.
- It's answers first.

38:27.028 --> 38:28.651
Are you fucking my wife?

38:39.593 --> 38:41.491
He thinks we're assholes.

38:41.526 --> 38:42.665
I say we fuck him up.

38:42.699 --> 38:43.873
What are we waiting for?

38:43.907 --> 38:46.979
Are you sleeping with my wife?

38:54.884 --> 38:55.884
No.

38:56.920 --> 38:57.920
I'm a therapist.

39:05.066 --> 39:07.103
I feel we have danced like this

39:07.137 --> 39:09.001
a thousand lifetimes before.

39:13.558 --> 39:14.697
Fucking liar!

39:14.731 --> 39:16.630
I am not gonna have
this smug little prick

39:16.664 --> 39:18.114
play fucking mind games with me.

39:19.874 --> 39:21.566
I'm a therapist.

39:21.600 --> 39:22.981
I'm treating her.

39:23.015 --> 39:24.015
For what?

39:24.983 --> 39:27.468
We are bound by
patient-client confidentiality.

39:27.503 --> 39:30.402
Well, right now you're
bound by duct tape, asshole.

39:34.613 --> 39:36.132
I treat people
who have problem:

39:37.029 --> 39:38.030
mental problems,

39:39.204 --> 39:40.550
physical problems,

39:42.034 --> 39:43.588
spiritual problems.

39:43.622 --> 39:45.969
We know all about your
fucking little immigrant hustle.

39:46.004 --> 39:47.108
You're an escort.

39:47.143 --> 39:49.110
I say we fuck him up.

39:49.145 --> 39:51.596
No, I am a therapist.

39:51.630 --> 39:55.979
In a rented apartment in the
middle of the fucking night?

39:56.014 --> 39:57.015
In your car?

40:02.572 --> 40:05.713
Yeah, he's all
fucking class, this guy.

40:14.964 --> 40:15.964
I can explain.

40:20.590 --> 40:21.626
I treat them.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.457
I treat all your wives.

40:27.597 --> 40:28.736
Lizzy Hanson,

40:29.944 --> 40:30.944
Esther Jarret,

40:32.602 --> 40:33.914
Susie Ellis.

40:35.122 --> 40:37.020
Check in my pants
you will see my ID.

40:40.645 --> 40:41.749
I'm legally licensed.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.588
Holy shit
he's not lying.

40:53.727 --> 40:56.281
So, you're a licensed
therapist who fucks his clients?

40:56.315 --> 40:59.077
No, I help them
with their problems.

40:59.111 --> 41:00.734
Are you listening to this?

41:00.768 --> 41:02.159
Where do you get your
fucking balls big enough?

41:02.183 --> 41:04.013
You see the clothes
this guy has on?

41:04.047 --> 41:05.635
Look at that shirt he's wearing.

41:05.670 --> 41:07.603
How much of my money
paid for that shirt?

41:07.637 --> 41:09.087
How much?
- Alright, calm down.

41:10.537 --> 41:12.815
How much do they pay
for your treatments?

41:12.849 --> 41:14.264
Depends on their problems.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.820
Each case is different.

41:17.854 --> 41:19.684
How much did my wife pay?

41:19.718 --> 41:20.892
Per hour!

41:20.926 --> 41:23.653
Admit it you fucked
my little Susie, didn't you?

41:23.688 --> 41:26.276
Satisfaction guaranteed
or your money back.

41:26.311 --> 41:28.140
How much did she pay you?

41:32.179 --> 41:34.975
$275 an hour.

41:35.009 --> 41:36.666
What?

41:36.701 --> 41:38.668
$275 per hour?

41:40.118 --> 41:42.051
Does she owe you money?

41:42.085 --> 41:43.259
No, she doesn't.

41:44.950 --> 41:46.203
Do you know
how much fucking money?

41:46.227 --> 41:47.677
Do you know how
much money I make?

41:54.097 --> 41:56.755
How long have you
slept with Susie?

41:57.825 --> 42:01.691
Like I said I treat her.

42:01.726 --> 42:02.899
How long?

42:02.934 --> 42:03.935
Answer him!

42:05.626 --> 42:06.696
About five months.

42:08.146 --> 42:09.699
And Lizzy?

42:09.734 --> 42:10.734
Maybe six.

42:12.737 --> 42:15.774
How did it all start?

42:15.809 --> 42:17.569
Through referrals.

42:17.604 --> 42:18.777
- Referrals?
- Referrals?

42:18.812 --> 42:19.744
What?

42:19.778 --> 42:20.641
Yeah, I'm a therapist.

42:20.676 --> 42:21.780
I have a business.

42:22.850 --> 42:24.369
I have a list of
private clients.

42:24.403 --> 42:25.957
I'm very selective.

42:25.991 --> 42:28.787
So, who referred Susie?

42:28.822 --> 42:31.790
I said I cannot tell you.

42:33.033 --> 42:35.138
So, it's just a business.

42:35.173 --> 42:36.623
You pay taxes.

42:36.657 --> 42:38.659
You provide insurance?

42:38.694 --> 42:39.971
I'm not out to hurt anyone.

42:42.974 --> 42:44.700
I'm just there to save them.

42:44.734 --> 42:45.735
Save them?

42:45.770 --> 42:47.357
Yes, save them
from themselves.

42:47.392 --> 42:49.774
You just manipulate
women, don't you?

42:53.847 --> 42:55.055
I am not the bad guy here.

42:55.987 --> 42:57.126
So, who is?

42:58.679 --> 42:59.887
You tell me, I mean.

42:59.922 --> 43:01.613
Don't you get smart with me.

43:02.752 --> 43:06.411
Then why did she pay you?

43:06.445 --> 43:07.274
You don't wanna know.

43:07.308 --> 43:08.862
- Why?
- Answer him!

43:08.896 --> 43:09.966
Fucking answer him!

43:12.003 --> 43:13.970
Why do you think
she comes to see me?

43:15.765 --> 43:18.147
Why do you think all your
wives come to see me?

43:21.875 --> 43:23.083
You better be careful.

43:24.912 --> 43:29.917
I wanna know why Lizzy lied
about bridge night on Tuesday

43:30.849 --> 43:32.129
and girls' night
out on Thursday.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.716
I'm gonna find out,

43:38.892 --> 43:41.032
and if I don't get a
satisfactory answer,

43:41.066 --> 43:43.172
we are gonna fuck
this bastard up.

44:00.016 --> 44:03.019
Listen, they trust me,
and I'm just there for them.

44:04.780 --> 44:06.091
They want to talk,

44:06.126 --> 44:11.131
and I listen to understand
them to help them,

44:13.340 --> 44:15.687
to help them become wives again,

44:17.137 --> 44:20.036
to help them become
better women.

44:20.071 --> 44:24.385
How dare you sit there and
talk about my woman like that?

44:24.420 --> 44:25.835
You don't know her.

44:25.870 --> 44:30.012
"My woman," you see
that's the problem.

44:30.046 --> 44:32.877
She is someone's
daughter or sister.

44:33.981 --> 44:36.846
My wife she's not a thing.

44:37.951 --> 44:39.849
She's not a piece of meat.

44:39.884 --> 44:41.989
There are a few
things she deserves.

44:43.232 --> 44:45.234
She wants to be respected.

44:45.268 --> 44:47.961
She wants to be loved.

44:47.995 --> 44:51.896
So, you make 'em feel loved.

44:53.173 --> 44:54.899
Make 'em feel wanted?

44:54.933 --> 44:57.177
You see, we connect.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.800
We talk.

44:59.835 --> 45:00.525
We sit.

45:00.559 --> 45:01.559
We watch TV.

45:02.872 --> 45:06.013
Sometimes I read to them
and they fall asleep.

45:08.429 --> 45:10.777
I give them what
they're missing.

45:23.513 --> 45:25.101
It's not about sex.

45:27.172 --> 45:29.968
Well, then what are
you talking about,

45:30.003 --> 45:32.937
fucking respect, making
them feel special?

45:32.971 --> 45:35.422
I'm not here to
break your marriages.

45:35.456 --> 45:37.562
I'm actually helping them.

45:37.596 --> 45:39.046
I should cut your cock off.

45:40.220 --> 45:41.991
Then we'd see how you'd
be there to help them.

45:42.015 --> 45:44.017
I am happily married myself.

45:44.051 --> 45:46.571
Married you're a fucking liar.

45:46.605 --> 45:49.781
Look at my phone
I have pictures.

45:49.816 --> 45:54.130
69-11-69.

45:54.165 --> 45:55.787
I even have a
beautiful daughter.

45:55.822 --> 45:57.858
You're all a drain on society.

45:59.066 --> 46:03.105
So, how does your wife
feel about what you do?

46:04.969 --> 46:07.419
She understand that
I'm helping people.

46:07.454 --> 46:09.111
It's not personal.

46:09.145 --> 46:11.078
Oh, hold on.

46:11.113 --> 46:12.355
Let me get this straight.

46:13.253 --> 46:16.497
You fuck my wife and I pay you,

46:16.532 --> 46:18.258
and it's not personal.

46:18.292 --> 46:20.087
I'm simply feeding my family.

46:20.122 --> 46:24.298
Oh, you know, I'd feed her.

46:24.333 --> 46:26.438
Yeah, she's not bad.

46:26.473 --> 46:29.372
Actually, you know what
I'd fuck her.

46:29.407 --> 46:30.615
How would you like that?

46:30.649 --> 46:32.449
How would you like if
I'd fuck your wife, huh?

46:33.514 --> 46:35.447
I'd give her the
ride of her life.

46:37.346 --> 46:39.866
Susie was right about you.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.315
What did you say?

46:42.523 --> 46:45.872
I said that Susie
was right about you.

46:47.011 --> 46:49.047
Why do you think
she comes to see me?

46:50.462 --> 46:52.016
Because you sleep with her.

46:52.050 --> 46:53.050
No, wrong answer.

46:54.570 --> 46:56.020
Why?

46:56.054 --> 46:58.919
Because I work
hard and I work late?

46:59.886 --> 47:00.886
No.

47:01.473 --> 47:02.473
Then why?

47:04.304 --> 47:05.892
Because you are in denial.

47:09.067 --> 47:10.966
You're losing your business.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.933
Close to bankruptcy.
- Shut up!

47:14.210 --> 47:16.040
You can't repay
your creditors.

47:19.526 --> 47:21.114
You're one of his
creditors, right?

47:21.148 --> 47:22.598
I said shut up.

47:22.632 --> 47:24.048
Unless you know about this.

47:30.054 --> 47:31.124
You know what

47:33.333 --> 47:35.059
you have no backbone.

47:40.236 --> 47:41.582
You are gutless.

47:43.136 --> 47:44.482
It's okay.

47:44.516 --> 47:48.072
- You're yella!
- I said shut the fuck up.

47:49.556 --> 47:51.454
Fucking my wife.

47:53.042 --> 47:54.561
Giving her the ride of her life.

47:56.045 --> 47:57.150
How you gonna do that?

47:59.393 --> 48:00.636
You can't even get it up.

48:04.502 --> 48:06.021
You're impotent.

48:11.164 --> 48:13.028
She called you Viagra.

48:14.201 --> 48:15.547
Get it?

48:15.582 --> 48:17.101
Can't get it up?

48:21.277 --> 48:23.176
The thing is your
wife needs sex.

48:24.660 --> 48:26.524
She's not had sex for years.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.030
Well, good morning, sunshine.

48:50.065 --> 48:51.480
Tell me about my money.

48:54.621 --> 48:56.071
Go get that hammer.

48:57.210 --> 48:58.556
You can still let me go.

49:00.178 --> 49:02.491
I'm not gonna say
anything to the police.

49:02.525 --> 49:04.148
No one needs to know.

49:04.182 --> 49:06.046
Tell me what you and Lizzy

49:06.081 --> 49:08.048
were planning to
do with my money.

49:08.083 --> 49:09.567
I said go get that hammer!

49:14.261 --> 49:18.024
If you tell me about the
money, I can make this stop.

49:18.058 --> 49:19.058
It's up to you.

49:20.543 --> 49:22.097
No, no!

49:24.133 --> 49:25.317
What are you doing?
- I'm gonna enjoy this

49:25.341 --> 49:26.801
more than you enjoyed
fucking my wife.

49:26.825 --> 49:28.379
Where's that hammer?

49:28.413 --> 49:30.415
Get it in here.

49:30.450 --> 49:32.107
To that hands.
- No, don't do this.

49:32.141 --> 49:33.349
Give it to him!

49:33.384 --> 49:35.731
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

49:35.765 --> 49:37.329
- Give it to him!
- No, no, don't do this!

49:37.353 --> 49:39.159
No, don't do it, don't do it!
- Give it to him!

49:39.183 --> 49:41.150
- You are not like him.
- Give it to him!

49:41.185 --> 49:42.255
You're better than him.

49:42.289 --> 49:43.335
Come on, you pussy!

49:43.359 --> 49:44.429
You know it.

49:44.464 --> 49:46.052
Don't, don't!

49:47.260 --> 49:48.192
No, don't it.
- Do it!

49:48.226 --> 49:49.296
Do it!

49:51.126 --> 49:52.817
- You are not like him!
- Shit.

50:05.312 --> 50:07.142
Hey, you alright?

50:09.627 --> 50:11.284
I'm sorry, I just...

50:11.318 --> 50:12.733
I couldn't.

50:12.768 --> 50:14.125
It's alright, it's alright
don't worry about it.

50:14.149 --> 50:15.471
We just gotta get
back inside let's go.

50:15.495 --> 50:17.324
No, I can't do this.

50:19.188 --> 50:20.293
I'm sorry.

50:20.327 --> 50:22.847
No, listen we all agreed.

50:22.881 --> 50:25.298
We agreed we were gonna
strip him, beat him,

50:25.332 --> 50:27.507
throw him in the grave to
scare the shit out of him,

50:27.541 --> 50:29.519
you know and then send him
home with a final warning,

50:29.543 --> 50:31.062
but not this.

50:31.097 --> 50:32.408
I know, I know.

50:32.443 --> 50:33.685
This is way out of hand.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.273
I know Jarret's
out of control.

50:39.760 --> 50:42.798
I know, you know that I know.

50:48.838 --> 50:50.116
I don't like you.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.086
Listen, I'm sorry
about the business.

50:55.121 --> 50:56.684
I was gonna tell you I
just didn't know how.

50:56.708 --> 50:57.927
I don't give a shit
about the business.

50:57.951 --> 51:02.162
No, I was trying to fix it,
but then I just it got worse.

51:02.197 --> 51:03.819
I'm fucked.

51:03.853 --> 51:04.751
I fucked up.

51:04.785 --> 51:07.271
I understand, it's okay.

51:07.305 --> 51:09.169
But I swear to you,
you're gonna get paid.

51:09.204 --> 51:10.481
Everyone's gonna get paid.

51:10.515 --> 51:12.217
I'm gonna pay you back.
- It's okay, listen.

51:12.241 --> 51:13.425
Everybody is
gonna get paid back!

51:13.449 --> 51:14.761
I've already taken care of it!

51:14.795 --> 51:15.795
Do you understand?

51:19.731 --> 51:21.285
What do you mean?

51:24.702 --> 51:28.395
What do you mean you've
taken care of it?

51:32.710 --> 51:34.298
You're not taking my business.

51:34.332 --> 51:36.127
Lizzy's gonna be
here any second.

51:36.162 --> 51:38.198
Come on, let's go.
- No, I'm not going back!

51:38.233 --> 51:40.407
Okay, then get out
of here, alright, go!

51:46.310 --> 51:49.520
This night he said he
was ready not to report it.

51:49.554 --> 51:50.935
We can all walk away from this.

51:50.969 --> 51:52.109
I'm gonna handle it, okay?

51:52.143 --> 51:54.421
I'm gonna fucking handle it
like I handled everything.

51:56.872 --> 51:58.529
Now get out of here!

52:00.255 --> 52:02.291
I'm telling you, you're
not taking my business.

52:02.326 --> 52:04.431
Over the fence
same way you came in.

52:06.330 --> 52:07.410
You're not taking my business.

52:07.434 --> 52:08.642
Don't let 'em see you.

52:13.578 --> 52:14.855
Don't you dare, don't!

52:14.890 --> 52:15.925
No, no!
- Oh yeah!

52:48.303 --> 52:49.235
No!

52:51.927 --> 52:52.927
Stop!

52:54.447 --> 52:55.447
Enough!

52:57.277 --> 52:58.277
Fuck!

52:59.245 --> 52:59.900
He had it coming.

52:59.935 --> 53:01.005
Look, we agreed.

53:01.039 --> 53:02.569
We're gonna humiliate him,
scare him a little bit

53:02.593 --> 53:03.594
and then cut him loose.

53:06.424 --> 53:07.736
- Where's Ellis?
- He's gone.

53:08.771 --> 53:10.290
That fucking coward.

53:13.259 --> 53:14.546
What is it with you
and these questions?

53:14.570 --> 53:17.332
He's got answers I want 'em!

53:23.579 --> 53:25.547
Lizzy's gonna
be here at 11:30.

53:25.581 --> 53:27.342
- That's right.
- Yeah.

53:27.376 --> 53:28.964
I feel sorry for her.

53:28.998 --> 53:32.347
What the fuck are you
mumbling about, huh?

53:32.381 --> 53:34.556
I feel sorry for Esther.

53:36.937 --> 53:38.939
She used to pay me
just to cry over you.

53:41.701 --> 53:44.980
That psychoanalysis
bullshit don't work with me.

53:45.014 --> 53:47.327
Why you don't wanna
hear about the truth?

53:49.364 --> 53:50.399
About her secrets?

53:51.504 --> 53:52.504
Jamie Jarret.

53:53.954 --> 53:55.749
You think the entire
world owes you.

53:56.612 --> 53:57.786
That's not true.

53:57.820 --> 54:00.651
Nobody gives a fuck,
and that's killing you.

54:02.377 --> 54:05.414
That's why you drink,
you fucking drunk!

54:10.316 --> 54:11.558
Oh, boy.

54:12.766 --> 54:14.423
- Watch your head.
- Okay, okay, okay.

54:14.458 --> 54:16.391
Thank you, thank you.

54:19.497 --> 54:21.465
Come on, for Christ
sakes where's my dinner?

54:21.499 --> 54:23.052
I asked for it,
like, 10 minutes ago!

54:23.087 --> 54:25.917
- It's coming, it's coming.
- Yeah, well come on please!

54:26.780 --> 54:28.472
Just what the?

54:28.506 --> 54:30.681
Clean that up!

54:30.715 --> 54:33.546
You bring salad to the table
that's got no dressing on it!

54:33.580 --> 54:34.961
Clean it up!

54:34.995 --> 54:37.757
You know, I feel bad for her.

54:37.791 --> 54:41.899
I feel bad for your sister
'cause she loves him.

54:41.933 --> 54:45.005
What the fuck have you
been doing all day, huh?

54:45.040 --> 54:47.594
What the fuck have you
been doing all day?

54:47.629 --> 54:49.734
Get me another beer, now!

54:51.840 --> 54:52.840
She loves you,

54:57.086 --> 54:58.398
and that's killing her.

55:14.828 --> 55:19.833
The truth is without
her you you're nothing.

55:21.387 --> 55:24.390
Just fucking lost, you fucking
moron, and you know it.

55:25.977 --> 55:28.463
You just keep
talking shit, boy.

55:28.497 --> 55:30.982
I'm gonna knock that
fucking smile off your face.

55:31.017 --> 55:32.017
Oh, yeah?

55:33.191 --> 55:35.642
What about the headaches, huh?

55:35.677 --> 55:37.403
Let's talk about the headaches.

55:53.764 --> 55:55.662
Wait a minute.

55:55.697 --> 55:57.388
What about her headaches?

55:57.423 --> 55:59.746
Why do you think she goes in
the hospital every week, huh?

55:59.770 --> 56:02.151
Why do you think, what
causes the imbalance?

56:02.186 --> 56:03.474
What the fuck is
he talking about?

56:03.498 --> 56:05.189
How can you do
that to a woman?

56:05.223 --> 56:06.718
Your sister what are
you gonna do about it?

56:06.742 --> 56:07.985
Shut your lying filthy!

56:08.019 --> 56:08.917
Why
would you do that?

56:08.951 --> 56:10.090
Why would you do that?

56:11.782 --> 56:13.853
Stop, you're gonna kill him!

56:13.887 --> 56:15.164
You'll kill him!

56:15.199 --> 56:16.199
Stop!

56:18.582 --> 56:19.893
Fuck him!

56:25.761 --> 56:27.418
He's been beating your sister.

56:27.453 --> 56:29.040
- This is it!
- No, I'm sorry!

56:29.075 --> 56:31.491
No, I'm sorry!
- This is how rude!

56:50.268 --> 56:51.718
Is that true?

56:52.892 --> 56:55.515
Yeah, I have
pictures on my phone.

56:56.205 --> 56:59.174
69-11-69.

56:59.208 --> 57:01.176
He's a fucking liar.

57:01.210 --> 57:02.660
You've been beating Esther?

57:03.696 --> 57:05.629
- He's lying!
- You marinate yourself

57:05.663 --> 57:07.527
in vodka and you beat my sister!

57:07.562 --> 57:08.677
Fuck you, Richie, what
have you ever done for me?

57:08.701 --> 57:10.081
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:10.116 --> 57:11.704
I've been carrying
you for years.

57:11.738 --> 57:13.878
Oh, you employ me
so now you own me?

57:15.811 --> 57:19.746
All she does is take care
of you and you beat her?

57:19.781 --> 57:21.714
You abuse her like a punk?

57:22.956 --> 57:23.956
Fuck you!

57:48.879 --> 57:50.570
Fuck.

57:50.605 --> 57:51.640
Fuck.

57:55.195 --> 57:57.197
I never hit her.
- Ah.

57:58.889 --> 57:59.889
She's dying.

58:04.101 --> 58:06.759
She's dying from a brain tumor.

58:11.764 --> 58:13.662
She wanted you to be
the last one to know.

58:15.181 --> 58:17.148
She wanted you to feel guilty,

58:18.322 --> 58:23.120
to feel pain the way
she's felt for years,

58:23.845 --> 58:24.845
every single day.

58:30.748 --> 58:31.748
Dead.

58:33.855 --> 58:35.719
Dead but smiling,

58:40.862 --> 58:45.867
because then she'll be free.

58:54.841 --> 58:56.049
Esther's dying?

59:08.924 --> 59:11.927
You ever touch my sister
again and I'll kill you.

59:11.962 --> 59:13.135
You understand me?

59:13.170 --> 59:15.310
What you're gonna
take his word over mine?

59:16.380 --> 59:18.140
Do you want me to look?

59:18.175 --> 59:19.832
You said family
should stick together.

59:19.866 --> 59:21.661
You're not my family.

59:21.696 --> 59:23.836
You don't work for
me you're fired.

59:23.870 --> 59:26.286
This is over get the
fuck out of here.

59:35.813 --> 59:37.332
You know what,
Richie, fuck you.

01:00:29.211 --> 01:00:30.211
I'm sorry.

01:00:31.455 --> 01:00:33.768
We never should've
done this to you,

01:00:33.802 --> 01:00:34.802
and that's my fault.

01:00:38.117 --> 01:00:42.777
So, how about I
just cut you loose,

01:00:42.811 --> 01:00:45.055
and we forget this whole
thing ever happened?

01:00:50.336 --> 01:00:51.336
Okay.

01:01:31.308 --> 01:01:33.034
My fingers are broken.

01:01:33.068 --> 01:01:34.114
I'll take you to the hospital.

01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:35.138
I'll pay for it.

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:40.005
Here.

01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:45.321
It's okay.

01:01:49.429 --> 01:01:50.441
I wouldn't
blame you if you wanted

01:01:50.465 --> 01:01:51.846
to press charges.

01:02:05.894 --> 01:02:07.516
Press charges against who?

01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:10.278
You guys or your wife, Lizzy?

01:02:11.279 --> 01:02:12.279
My wife?

01:02:13.212 --> 01:02:14.212
Yeah.

01:02:16.008 --> 01:02:17.008
She scares me.

01:02:17.561 --> 01:02:19.183
She scares you?

01:02:19.218 --> 01:02:21.496
All my other clients
understand that

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.050
I have a family, a wife
and a beautiful daughter.

01:02:25.983 --> 01:02:29.021
But Lizzy she would
not leave me alone.

01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:31.989
That scares me.

01:02:33.094 --> 01:02:34.440
You're sleeping with my wife,

01:02:34.474 --> 01:02:35.786
and my wife scares you?

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.857
I have not slept
with your wife.

01:02:37.892 --> 01:02:39.065
Don't bullshit me!

01:02:41.033 --> 01:02:43.380
I have never slept
with your wife.

01:02:43.414 --> 01:02:47.073
All that is just a
big misunderstanding.

01:02:53.908 --> 01:02:56.945
Your wife she will
not leave me alone.

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.084
She calls me all the time,

01:03:00.915 --> 01:03:05.264
calling me, calling
my cell, my house.

01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:08.888
She even call me sometimes
when she's in bed with you.

01:03:08.923 --> 01:03:10.176
I've known my
wife for five years.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.615
We've been married for four.

01:03:11.649 --> 01:03:15.377
You do not know
your wife, believe me.

01:03:15.412 --> 01:03:16.896
The other day she
sent me a video

01:03:16.931 --> 01:03:19.347
of my wife shopping with my kid.

01:03:28.045 --> 01:03:30.013
How does she know my wife, huh?

01:03:35.087 --> 01:03:36.951
Maybe you're
telling the truth,

01:03:36.985 --> 01:03:39.919
but maybe you're not and
maybe you deserve this.

01:03:39.954 --> 01:03:41.300
Maybe this is karma.

01:03:57.005 --> 01:03:58.524
Do you know your
wife has a gun?

01:04:00.698 --> 01:04:01.698
- A gun?
- Yeah.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.051
She says she will kill me.

01:04:09.984 --> 01:04:10.985
She will kill my family,

01:04:12.193 --> 01:04:13.401
and then she'll kill herself.

01:04:13.435 --> 01:04:14.678
This is bullshit!

01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:16.104
You're telling me I
don't know my wife?

01:04:16.128 --> 01:04:17.060
I don't think you
do know your wife.

01:04:17.094 --> 01:04:19.614
You have to understand that.

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:21.547
She's not who you think she is.

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:24.170
Your wife is...

01:04:26.414 --> 01:04:27.414
For me she's crazy.

01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:30.659
Please check yourself.

01:04:58.204 --> 01:04:59.447
You're right.

01:05:04.107 --> 01:05:06.350
I don't know my wife Lizzy.

01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:11.045
Lizzy doesn't love me anymore.

01:05:14.531 --> 01:05:17.189
All I ever wanted was to
have a child with her.

01:05:22.263 --> 01:05:26.129
I think you need to
hear her for yourself.

01:05:30.098 --> 01:05:32.066
You need to understand
what's going on.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:36.449
Why don't you go to the
closet, wait for her to come,

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:43.698
then you'll hear and
then you will understand.

01:05:55.434 --> 01:05:56.434
Karma.

01:05:58.195 --> 01:05:59.576
That's Her Majesty.

01:06:01.716 --> 01:06:02.716
Answer it.

01:06:05.547 --> 01:06:06.547
On speaker.

01:06:11.174 --> 01:06:12.278
Hi.

01:06:14.211 --> 01:06:15.316
Are you there?
- Hi.

01:06:16.558 --> 01:06:17.570
Is there a problem?

01:06:17.594 --> 01:06:19.699
No, all is well here.

01:06:19.734 --> 01:06:21.115
Waiting for you.

01:06:21.149 --> 01:06:22.116
Okay.

01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:23.462
How long before you get here?

01:06:23.496 --> 01:06:24.739
Five to 10 minutes.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:28.294
Okay, five to 10
minutes I'll be here.

01:06:29.675 --> 01:06:31.263
I'll be there soon.

01:06:31.297 --> 01:06:32.297
See you shortly.

01:06:38.442 --> 01:06:42.136
And also, I know
about the money.

01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:48.659
There's something she's going
to do regarding your business.

01:06:48.694 --> 01:06:50.144
What, what is she planning?

01:06:51.593 --> 01:06:55.183
It's not very clear, but
I'm sure I can find out.

01:06:58.152 --> 01:07:00.119
How do I know
this isn't a setup?

01:07:36.569 --> 01:07:37.639
Oh, my god.

01:07:39.848 --> 01:07:40.848
Oh, my god.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.888
Oh, my god.
- Watch out.

01:07:44.922 --> 01:07:45.889
Fuck, what happened to you?

01:07:45.923 --> 01:07:47.132
I'm okay.

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:48.340
What happened to you god?

01:07:49.513 --> 01:07:51.826
I was attacked by a
bunch of drunk guys.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:55.347
Oh, sweetheart, you okay?

01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:56.693
Are you okay?

01:07:56.727 --> 01:07:58.246
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:08:00.283 --> 01:08:02.630
I'm never gonna let
anybody hurt you, sweetheart.

01:08:02.664 --> 01:08:06.737
I know.

01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:08.153
Are you okay?

01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:10.189
Yeah, can you get
me some water please?

01:08:35.765 --> 01:08:38.216
I'm never gonna
let anybody hurt you.

01:08:39.356 --> 01:08:40.564
Oh, my god.

01:08:40.599 --> 01:08:42.187
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:45.430
It's okay.

01:08:45.466 --> 01:08:46.466
It's okay.

01:08:50.435 --> 01:08:51.435
I love you.

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.990
I love you.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.514
Do you remember
the beautiful day

01:09:00.721 --> 01:09:02.828
at the beach, beautiful sunset?

01:09:06.002 --> 01:09:07.350
Dance with me.

01:09:07.384 --> 01:09:08.420
Yeah.

01:09:09.973 --> 01:09:14.252
Dance like we have danced
a thousand lifetimes.

01:09:14.287 --> 01:09:15.805
Yeah, that's it.

01:09:19.776 --> 01:09:21.363
Oh, sweetheart.

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:28.163
Sweetheart.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:35.688
In all my dreams,

01:09:40.245 --> 01:09:43.662
I never imagined that
this day would come.

01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:46.319
I mean you and me right here,

01:09:48.701 --> 01:09:50.876
right now, just like this.

01:09:56.468 --> 01:09:57.779
You fixed me.

01:09:59.367 --> 01:10:00.367
You made me strong.

01:10:03.268 --> 01:10:06.340
You put me back together again.

01:10:06.374 --> 01:10:07.479
You saved me.

01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:09.481
You saved me.

01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:11.552
You fixed my heart.

01:10:13.795 --> 01:10:14.795
I know it.

01:10:16.281 --> 01:10:19.387
You know, now it's our time.

01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:27.326
You know what?

01:10:35.507 --> 01:10:37.233
Look, look at this.

01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:40.614
I got it.

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:44.032
It's everything.

01:10:44.067 --> 01:10:46.345
It's everything that we need

01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:50.522
for the house in
Thailand to get set up.

01:10:50.556 --> 01:10:53.697
Everything we need for
a new life together.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.630
It's just you and me.

01:11:00.497 --> 01:11:01.567
We've got it!

01:11:07.849 --> 01:11:10.783
I can't do this
anymore, I can't.

01:11:10.818 --> 01:11:12.060
- Huh?
- Listen.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.583
I just can't do this anymore.

01:11:19.447 --> 01:11:20.379
Listen.

01:11:20.414 --> 01:11:21.622
What?

01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:22.976
I'm never gonna
leave my family.

01:11:24.487 --> 01:11:27.421
This is a beautiful dream,

01:11:27.455 --> 01:11:30.424
but let's get back to reality.

01:11:31.528 --> 01:11:34.531
I'm sorry I don't
understand what you're saying.

01:11:34.566 --> 01:11:39.398
That story of soulmates
and all that crap.

01:11:40.744 --> 01:11:44.507
I think your imagination
just went wild.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.336
What about your wrist?

01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:50.927
Lizzy, I was
just doing my job.

01:11:52.584 --> 01:11:53.619
I don't understand.

01:11:55.725 --> 01:11:58.831
So, you don't wanna be with me?

01:12:05.148 --> 01:12:07.599
You said that you loved me.

01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:11.741
You said that you wanted
to be with me forever.

01:12:17.471 --> 01:12:19.507
I was just doing
my job, alright?

01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:22.959
I was doing my job.

01:12:48.502 --> 01:12:49.502
Lizzy.

01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:53.541
Get off of me!

01:12:54.818 --> 01:12:55.818
Get off!

01:12:58.615 --> 01:13:01.584
- Lizzy.
- Go away from me!

01:13:01.618 --> 01:13:03.620
Please stop it
don't do that again.

01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:05.898
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:13:05.933 --> 01:13:06.933
Go away!

01:13:09.626 --> 01:13:10.741
- You're scaring me.
- What the fuck

01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:11.973
is your problem?

01:13:12.008 --> 01:13:14.217
- You are scaring me.
- What about soulmates?

01:13:14.251 --> 01:13:15.977
What about our parents?

01:13:16.012 --> 01:13:17.634
What about our parents?

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:22.501
You said that our parents
both died to same way!

01:13:22.536 --> 01:13:23.675
You said that!

01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:24.952
Is that true?

01:13:24.986 --> 01:13:26.574
Is that true?

01:13:26.609 --> 01:13:28.196
Is that true?

01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:29.128
No.

01:13:29.163 --> 01:13:31.061
You said we were soulmates!

01:13:31.096 --> 01:13:32.649
What have you done to my life?

01:13:32.684 --> 01:13:35.514
You said that we were
fucking soulmates!

01:13:35.549 --> 01:13:37.551
What is your problem?

01:13:37.585 --> 01:13:39.449
What is your problem?
- Stop, stop.

01:13:39.484 --> 01:13:41.727
- What is your problem?
- Stop, don't do that!

01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:42.980
- What is your problem?
- Lizzy, don't!

01:13:43.004 --> 01:13:45.006
You said that
we were together!

01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:46.560
You said that we
were together forever

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:49.597
and you wanted to be with
me forever no matter what!

01:13:49.632 --> 01:13:51.057
- What about your husband?
- What do you mean,

01:13:51.081 --> 01:13:52.842
what about my husband?

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:53.774
Don't you love him?

01:13:53.808 --> 01:13:54.982
What are you talking about?

01:13:55.016 --> 01:13:56.880
We've talked about
this a thousand times!

01:13:56.915 --> 01:13:59.158
You know what that was about!

01:13:59.193 --> 01:14:01.229
What are we about?
- You're gonna break his...

01:14:01.264 --> 01:14:02.748
- No!
- He needs you.

01:14:02.783 --> 01:14:03.991
You love me!

01:14:04.025 --> 01:14:06.476
What are you fucking doing?

01:14:06.511 --> 01:14:07.891
I don't understand!

01:14:07.926 --> 01:14:09.099
It's not about me.

01:14:09.134 --> 01:14:10.480
No, it's not.

01:14:10.515 --> 01:14:13.138
It's about me now,
and I don't need you.

01:14:13.172 --> 01:14:14.622
I don't need you!

01:14:14.657 --> 01:14:17.280
I don't need you anymore!

01:14:17.314 --> 01:14:18.695
I don't need you!
- You're crazy!

01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:19.558
I have got everything

01:14:19.593 --> 01:14:20.742
that I need!
- Lizzy, you're crazy!

01:14:20.766 --> 01:14:21.802
- No!
- I mean, stop it!

01:14:21.836 --> 01:14:23.217
- You stop it!
- Stop it!

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.712
You're the one
that's fucking crazy.

01:14:24.736 --> 01:14:26.116
You're just a fucking hustler.

01:14:26.151 --> 01:14:27.670
Oh, it's not about the sex!

01:14:27.704 --> 01:14:29.534
It's not about the sex!

01:14:29.568 --> 01:14:30.707
Oh, we're just playing.

01:14:30.742 --> 01:14:32.053
It is not about the sex.

01:14:32.088 --> 01:14:32.916
You're just playing.

01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:34.608
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:14:34.642 --> 01:14:36.299
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:38.025
Oh, I'm just here
to help you, baby.

01:14:38.059 --> 01:14:41.580
I just want to make everyone
so fucking happy, baby!

01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:43.099
You're just a bullshitter!

01:14:43.133 --> 01:14:44.790
You're a fucking bullshitter!

01:14:51.763 --> 01:14:53.040
Look at me!

01:14:53.074 --> 01:14:55.629
You think I'm a fucking fool?

01:14:55.663 --> 01:14:57.665
Do you think I'm
a fucking idiot?

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:01.635
Clearly, you have mistook
my kindness for weakness,

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:03.809
but I see right through you!

01:15:03.844 --> 01:15:06.294
You told me that you
wanted to have my baby.

01:15:06.329 --> 01:15:08.642
You told me to get
rid of his baby.

01:15:08.676 --> 01:15:09.677
I did that.

01:15:09.712 --> 01:15:11.714
I got rid of his baby for you,

01:15:11.748 --> 01:15:14.579
so I could have your baby!

01:15:14.613 --> 01:15:16.581
I'm having your baby!

01:15:16.615 --> 01:15:18.790
What are you talking about?

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.727
Help me.

01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:35.451
Help me.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.800
Help me.

01:16:43.668 --> 01:16:46.153
In another lifetime,
Lizzy Hanson,

01:16:46.187 --> 01:16:48.880
maybe things will be different.

01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:30.784
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:32.924
I know you feel the same.

01:17:34.201 --> 01:17:35.340
Come on, admit it.

01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:37.583
I can't
leave my husband.

01:17:37.618 --> 01:17:39.862
We are
soulmates, Lizzy.

01:17:39.896 --> 01:17:41.139
What about Richie?

01:17:41.173 --> 01:17:42.772
He doesn't understand,
doesn't connect with you.

01:17:42.796 --> 01:17:43.807
- No, stop it.
- I need you.

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:45.177
Just stop it!

01:17:45.212 --> 01:17:48.111
We can
be together, Lizzy.

01:17:48.146 --> 01:17:50.389
A child with
someone I can connect with.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.254
You're right.
- I love you.

01:17:53.289 --> 01:17:55.118
We're soulmates.

01:17:55.153 --> 01:17:56.153
I love you.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.917
We need the gun for
security, for our security.

01:18:00.952 --> 01:18:02.263
How did you find me?

01:18:03.437 --> 01:18:05.853
You just tell me what
you want I'll do it.

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:10.030
I feel we
have danced like this

01:18:10.064 --> 01:18:13.102
a thousand lifetimes before.

01:18:13.136 --> 01:18:14.828
That's it.
- Stop it.

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:15.932
That's it.

01:18:15.967 --> 01:18:17.244
Oh god, I love you.

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:37.885
Hey, darling.

01:18:41.233 --> 01:18:44.858
This tooth fairy's on his way
to his daughter with a tooth.

01:18:44.892 --> 01:18:45.962
Rough day?

01:18:45.997 --> 01:18:47.032
Mm.

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:49.171
Kind of.

01:18:50.242 --> 01:18:51.865
Did she bring the money?

01:18:51.899 --> 01:18:53.936
Yeah, she brought the money.

01:18:55.869 --> 01:18:56.880
On the need of the person.

01:18:56.904 --> 01:18:58.492
Whatever you need, you know,

01:18:58.526 --> 01:18:59.814
I can provide.
- Thank you so much.

01:18:59.838 --> 01:19:02.116
- Thank you.
- I appreciate you.

01:19:19.824 --> 01:19:21.342
I think this
one's really good.

01:19:22.965 --> 01:19:24.069
Yeah, it could work.

01:19:25.312 --> 01:19:29.178
Look at that married 24 years,

01:19:29.212 --> 01:19:31.007
He travels.

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:33.182
She spends her days at the club.

01:19:35.943 --> 01:19:38.843
- Perfect client.
- Perfect client.

01:19:42.363 --> 01:19:44.089
But it's a long story.

01:19:44.124 --> 01:19:46.402
I'll have to explain later.

01:19:46.436 --> 01:19:48.438
I had to let her go though.

01:19:48.473 --> 01:19:49.473
Don't worry.

01:19:50.371 --> 01:19:52.063
I have other
potentials lined up.

01:19:53.202 --> 01:19:54.202
Good.

01:19:56.067 --> 01:19:57.378
How much longer?

01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:01.382
In about half an hour.

01:20:05.007 --> 01:20:06.007
I love you.

01:20:07.112 --> 01:20:08.251
Love you more.
