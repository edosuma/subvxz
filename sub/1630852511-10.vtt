- Right?</b>

17:42.529 --> 17:44.464

17:44.531 --> 17:47.367

Is it all of the above?</b>

17:47.434 --> 17:49.069

17:59.846 --> 18:01.982

give some tips.</b>

18:02.049 --> 18:05.919
<b>- I consider myself a sexpert,
so maybe this person,</b>

18:05.986 --> 18:08.288
<b>I guess, is considered,
like, a colleague.</b>

18:09.890 --> 18:11.992
<b>But I definitely
don't need that.</b>

18:12.125 --> 18:13.360

<b>- No.
- They better-they better--</b>

18:32.613 --> 18:33.647
<b>- Well, we're not really
doing counseling anymore.</b>

18:33.714 --> 18:34.915
<b>Since the new move, we decided</b>

18:34.982 --> 18:36.550
<b>that we're just gonna be
more private,</b>

18:36.617 --> 18:37.918
<b>so I'm not gonna go into
every little detail.</b>

18:37.985 --> 18:39.319
<b>We told you we had sex...
- Oh, damn.</b>

18:39.386 --> 18:40.320
<b>- But we're not gonna start
going into our past</b>

18:40.387 --> 18:41.555
<b>and being, like...
- Oh!</b>

18:41.622 --> 18:43.190
<b>- "Oh, we had problems,"
and this and that.</b>

18:43.257 --> 18:46.159

it's just gonna be, you know...</b>

18:46.226 --> 18:47.661

18:49.663 --> 18:51.031
<b>- Flip the table.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.767
<b>- Chris and Ang do not like
the idea of a sex expert.</b>

18:53.834 --> 18:55.602
<b> </b><b><i>But it's not, like,</i></b><b>
</b><b><i>just for them.</i></b>

18:55.669 --> 18:58.205

</b><b><i>it would be such a fun idea</i></b>

37:05.493 --> 37:07.429
