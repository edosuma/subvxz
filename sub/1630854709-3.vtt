00:12.199 --> 00:14.595
Every year, students from all over Spain

00:14.679 --> 00:16.729
come to Cuenca
for their driver's license.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.359
Their destination:
Babieca driving school.

00:20.679 --> 00:23.036
With our patented
"Made in Cuenca" method,

00:23.120 --> 00:26.155
a full five days course,
you'll walk away license-in-hand.

00:26.239 --> 00:29.315
Here we won't tie you down
to do several classes a day.

00:29.399 --> 00:33.600
So that's why,
for "wheel", you'll be driving.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.516
We have over 50 tablets equipped
with the latest technology

00:37.600 --> 00:39.876
and we offer arranged accommodation.

00:39.960 --> 00:43.995
Future drivers from Valencia,
Madrid, Sevilla and vice versa

00:44.079 --> 00:45.879
come here for their driver's license

00:46.640 --> 00:50.315
and choose the best driving school:
Babieca driving school.

00:50.399 --> 00:51.916
Don't give it another thought.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.476
The more you think on it,
the longer it'll take.

00:54.560 --> 00:57.595
Babieca driving school,
we're the wheel deal.

00:57.679 --> 01:00.275
Did he say "We're the wheel deal"?

01:00.359 --> 01:01.320
Yes.

01:02.439 --> 01:04.400
Lopetegui, you've got to see this.

01:05.959 --> 01:09.396
- You're a student here?
- No, I'm just hanging with Yoli.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.879
And you're not studying?
Meaning in general.

01:12.959 --> 01:17.275
Boom! Again, deadpan humor.
Nicely done, Lopetegui.

01:17.359 --> 01:20.196
Did you know Lorenzo's brother
has a driving school in Cuenca?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.316
He's saying everyone there passes.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.515
Can you imagine Lorenzo saying that?
No, of course you can't.

01:25.599 --> 01:27.515
It's the celebs driving school.

01:27.599 --> 01:30.476
We saw some TV presenters,
some pop stars.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.280
They go there for their license:
five days and home with your "L".

01:34.840 --> 01:36.515
What do you mean five days later?

01:36.599 --> 01:38.756
Yes, he says he's
a full intensive course.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.140
Double lessons, in the morning
theoretical and afternoon practical.

01:42.439 --> 01:46.036
That's false advertisement.
Everyone passing, it can't be true, right?

01:46.120 --> 01:47.956
Don't tell Lorenzo, OK? He told me

01:48.040 --> 01:51.075
he can't stand his brother.
Literally not even in a picture.

01:51.159 --> 01:54.155
But it's impossible.
Who gets their license in five days?

01:54.239 --> 01:57.120
If it's where celebrities go,
it's a scam, trust me.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.875
- What's the name of the driving school?
- Babieca!

02:01.959 --> 02:03.359
Babieca.

02:03.799 --> 02:05.200
Lopetegui!

02:05.519 --> 02:07.996
Lopetegui, it's a scam. Can't you see?

02:08.080 --> 02:09.960
He wheely doesn't care.

02:12.840 --> 02:19.000
I DON'T LIKE DRIVING

02:19.919 --> 02:22.276
With our patented
"Made in Cuenca" method,

02:22.360 --> 02:25.555
a full five days course,
you'll walk away license-in-hand.

02:25.639 --> 02:28.876
Here we won't tie you down
to do several classes a day.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.156
So that's why,
for "wheel" you'll be driving.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.890
Do you know why nobody
grabs coffee from this machine?

02:33.879 --> 02:35.560
Yes, because it's disgusting.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.599
Most people prefer the cafeteria.
The coffee is better there.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.919
Yes, but the cafeteria has its drawbacks.

02:43.599 --> 02:45.400
- Such as?
- It's full of people.

02:46.840 --> 02:50.555
Well there's always the faculty lounge,
I'm sure it's not as busy.

02:50.639 --> 02:53.319
Forget it, it's full.
To top it off with professors.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.560
- Well here you're talking to me.
- I know.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.400
But you're not like the other professors.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.996
If you're shy enough to order coffee
from the staff, I'll order

03:05.080 --> 03:07.560
and you can wait for me
at the table, isolated.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.596
If I can avoid talking
to anyone, fantastic.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.400
- Yes?
- Yes, I like that, yes.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.479
Iria?

03:25.919 --> 03:27.276
Hello.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.000
- Made plans, did we?
- I have. You?

03:30.400 --> 03:32.276
I mean, did you and I make any plans?

03:32.360 --> 03:34.960
I've made plans close by with a person.

03:35.319 --> 03:37.520
You? Do you have a euro?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.759
No, I've also made plans.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.635
Not right now but... yes I've made plans.

03:43.719 --> 03:46.280
- That's great.
- I haven't fooled around since 98.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.080
But... Is yours very serious?

03:49.800 --> 03:53.199
I'm not dating anyone. I've got an
appointment with my psychologist.

03:57.759 --> 04:01.080
- Since when are you seeing a psychologist?
- For a while now.

04:01.639 --> 04:04.635
We lived together,
his office is right around the corner.

04:04.719 --> 04:06.019
- You didn't tell me.
- No.

04:06.919 --> 04:08.759
When can I give him my version?

04:15.159 --> 04:17.836
You're probably talking about me, no?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.516
- There's always two sides, Iria.
- Of course.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.875
Funnily enough, I was thinking today
"what do I tell him".

04:23.959 --> 04:27.115
Your failed novel,
about your driving license,

04:27.199 --> 04:29.499
or how you think
the world revolves around you?

04:30.920 --> 04:33.370
That last topic covers
a lot of ground, didn't it?

04:34.560 --> 04:35.959
You're an idiot.

04:36.879 --> 04:38.279
But you're being very funny.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.079
I'll take that, right?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.800
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:00.360 --> 05:01.600
Hello?

05:04.199 --> 05:07.199
THE MAP OF WHAT YOU ONCE WERE WILL BURN

05:25.120 --> 05:26.839
What are you reading, Lopetegui?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.839
- What are you doing here?
- I've a lesson with Lorenzo now. Any good?

05:32.399 --> 05:35.716
- At what time do you have class?
- I haven't read it yet.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.516
But they say it's minor work.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.879
But don't tell my dad that, of course.

05:40.519 --> 05:41.439
Hello, Yoli.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.396
Thanks for the book.
I'm really enjoying it.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.130
What are you doing here?
Your lesson's not till 17:30.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.156
- No. My lessons now.
- No, it's not.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.360
- Yes it is, check.
- I already have.

05:53.759 --> 05:57.596
What are you doing here professor?
You don't have class until 17:30.

05:57.680 --> 06:00.156
Let's see, I had it down as four.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.315
Had it down where?

06:01.399 --> 06:04.115
I didn't write it down anywhere,
I made a mental note.

06:04.199 --> 06:06.349
I write things down
like you're supposed to.

06:06.839 --> 06:09.995
Like I have always. With a pen and paper.

06:10.079 --> 06:14.480
Look. 16.00, Yolanda Macías.
17:30, Pablo Lopetegui.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.916
Are you Arturo Macías daughter?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.956
If you'd check the students list,
you might have guessed.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.836
Go ahead Pablo,
grab a magazine while you're waiting,

06:22.920 --> 06:24.639
because the book's not yours.

06:25.079 --> 06:27.315
I don't mind waiting.
He can go before me.

06:27.399 --> 06:30.516
No. This is a solomonic decision.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.319
Will do a joint class.

06:33.439 --> 06:35.399
No, that's not a solomonic decision.

06:36.199 --> 06:39.755
Come on, two birds with one stone.
Well, not at the same time though.

06:39.839 --> 06:42.560
One after the other.
Shaken but not stirred. Let's go.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.315
Why didn't you tell me?

06:47.399 --> 06:50.195
Giving me extra credit because
my dad is Arturo Macías?

06:50.279 --> 06:54.076
No, but handy to know your student's
the daughter of a language scholar.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.675
It's not like he helps me
with my homework.

06:56.759 --> 06:58.396
That's a shame, your father's...

06:58.480 --> 07:01.130
- My father what?
- He is something of an institution.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.195
This was a great idea. This way
we can pretend it's like an exam.

07:06.279 --> 07:09.276
One drives and one in the back.
Just missing the examiner.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.199
It's great practice for Yoli
as it's almost time for her driving exam.

07:15.399 --> 07:16.675
When?

07:16.759 --> 07:19.559
- In the next batch, I think.
- And you would be correct.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.115
Do you think you're all set
to take the test?

07:23.199 --> 07:25.516
- Not sure. I'll give it a go.
- It's good,

07:25.600 --> 07:28.160
to try it to have
an idea of what the exam is like.

07:29.279 --> 07:31.355
Maybe, I can try too.

07:31.439 --> 07:34.516
Easy cowboy.
You're not doing too badly professor,

07:34.600 --> 07:36.920
you still need more lessons
and for mechanics.

07:38.079 --> 07:40.079
- You've already done that?
- Yes.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.516
Listen professor, if you want
to give it a go, knock yourself out.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.355
Are you going to flunk? Most likely.

07:47.439 --> 07:50.276
When you're behind the wheel,
this thing does not exist.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.716
Same thing when you're teaching.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.516
Yoli, avanti tutti.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.036
OK, forget me taking the test,

07:58.120 --> 08:00.820
but maybe taking longer classes
like they do in Cuenca.

08:06.279 --> 08:07.720
What about Cuenca?

08:08.720 --> 08:12.439
- Nothing.
- You said Cuenca. What about Cuenca?

08:12.879 --> 08:17.036
We were watching the commercial for
that driving school... of your brothers.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.555
That's not a commercial, it's fake news.

08:19.639 --> 08:21.800
No one learns to drive in Cuenca.

08:22.839 --> 08:26.315
- Your brother says he has a method.
- He has a method my ass.

08:26.399 --> 08:28.839
He runs a raffle house
that gives licenses away.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.636
And the whole
"We're the wheel deal" idea was mine!

08:33.720 --> 08:37.356
He wanted to use
"come on, get wheel!" That's way worse.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.000
That's way more aggressive,
just like him. Of course.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.996
Lorenzo, answer it,
it might be important.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.080
Excuse me.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.835
You're not thinking of going
to Cuenca, are you?

08:50.919 --> 08:51.996
No, no.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.795
So why even bring it up? I told you,
Lorenzo can't stand his brother.

08:55.879 --> 08:57.996
Fuck, you're going to take the exam soon.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.315
How many lessons do I still have?
Six, twelve, twenty lessons.

09:01.399 --> 09:03.876
You're not going
to study for it ad eternum.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.480
Ad eternum? Ad eternum, Yolanda?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.516
Is that the way you talk at home?
Of course,

09:09.600 --> 09:12.360
your father is Arturo Macías.
Ad eternum, ad eternum.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.036
Is something wrong? Is it serious?

09:21.120 --> 09:24.320
My boy's having
an altercation with the taxi.

09:24.919 --> 09:27.955
Better I go sort it.
The taxi license is under my name.

09:28.039 --> 09:31.675
- We can make up the lesson another time.
- No, I'm a professional

09:31.759 --> 09:34.356
and I'm not going
to allow a private matter

09:34.440 --> 09:36.516
to get in the way of a scheduled lesson.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.759
So jump back in the car immediately.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.120
Let's go.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.595
I've never missed
a single day of driving school.

09:45.679 --> 09:49.236
I've taught with 39-degrees of
fever. That said not the best idea

09:49.320 --> 09:51.516
because the student caught the flu.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.360
But this is different.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.679
What happened?

10:13.759 --> 10:15.835
Lorenzo's son is a thug.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.200
No, he's not a thug. He's a cab driver.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.876
You, in the car.
Leave him. Get in the car!

10:23.960 --> 10:26.080
Get in the car!

10:28.120 --> 10:30.320
Careful, here he comes.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.955
Unbelievable! Un-fucking-believable!

10:34.039 --> 10:36.675
Can you believe this?
No need to generalize.

10:36.759 --> 10:38.675
Not all taxi drivers are like this.

10:38.759 --> 10:40.955
But some of my co-workers are...

10:41.039 --> 10:44.120
I call them frienemies. Frienemies!

10:44.440 --> 10:45.690
Look at Garrido, dipshit.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.980
Once back don't mention
"frienemy" isn't in the dictionary.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.200
Right back at you, you're the daughter
of a language scholar.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.080
What are you doing here?

11:03.360 --> 11:05.876
Get in the car! In the car!

11:05.960 --> 11:07.475
Run along, go blow your nose.

11:07.559 --> 11:11.080
Get in the car!
Rest and a balanced diet! Let's go!

11:18.240 --> 11:20.396
I've told you to not provoke Garrido,

11:20.480 --> 11:22.396
he's like a loose canon.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.475
But do you know what this dipshit did?

11:24.559 --> 11:26.916
He put an 8 year old girl
in a size 2 car seat.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.156
- Come on, please.
- Maybe the girl was a little short.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.475
Maybe a size 3 chair was too big.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.715
No, no. The girl was average weight.

11:34.799 --> 11:36.276
Normal percentage, dad.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.916
Twenty-six kilos.
A standard group 3 chair. End of story.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.075
- We'll be leaving now.
- No, no, no the lessons not over.

11:44.159 --> 11:46.876
Do they ask about
kids seat sizes in the test?

11:46.960 --> 11:50.000
It's one of the most important tests,
Yoli. The test of life.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.955
The altercation was because
a fellow taxi coworker...

11:57.039 --> 11:59.036
- Frienemy.
- OK, well...

11:59.120 --> 12:01.595
Who accepted a fare
to take a family with a girl

12:01.679 --> 12:04.075
and apparently
Garrido's kids seat is a size 2.

12:04.159 --> 12:07.236
And the girl was a size 3 all the way.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.075
Hang on, where were they headed?

12:09.159 --> 12:13.036
Within city limits
kids car seat's aren't mandatory.

12:13.120 --> 12:15.435
They're going to the airport.
And to go there

12:15.519 --> 12:18.080
you have to take the highway,
like it or not.

12:20.399 --> 12:22.499
- And that's why he messed up.
- Of course.

12:24.799 --> 12:27.675
No need to carry on
with this lesson. I'll grab a cab.

12:27.759 --> 12:30.195
Let's see professor, you're too old

12:30.279 --> 12:33.756
to be riding in a kid's car seat
size zero, one or infinite.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.290
The lesson's not over and it's your turn
to drive. Come on, you're up.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.080
Let's go.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.279
Move it.

12:56.200 --> 12:59.396
Put everything in place
and let's get out of here.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.835
We're going to go via General Lacy
and then on to the highway.

13:02.919 --> 13:04.916
Let's make the most of it and work on

13:05.000 --> 13:07.715
gear changes, that will be good
for you to work on

13:07.799 --> 13:10.795
and to start gaining
a little confidence on the wheel,

13:10.879 --> 13:13.715
with the change of lanes and all that,
hey, professor?

13:13.799 --> 13:16.916
- There is still...
- You're shamming our profession!

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Your fucking mother!

13:21.080 --> 13:23.195
Start! Start, start, start professor!

13:23.279 --> 13:25.276
Start her up! Start her up at once!

13:25.360 --> 13:26.876
Don't leave, you bastard!

13:26.960 --> 13:28.200
- Let's go!
- Come on!

13:29.919 --> 13:32.356
- I don't have my belt on.
- Non ti preocupare.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.390
I'll turn a blind eye this time,
sometimes you just have to.

13:36.279 --> 13:38.876
I am stickler for the rules,

13:38.960 --> 13:40.876
but you're acting like a State Trooper.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.010
We complain about
cab drivers reputations.

13:43.879 --> 13:46.080
The perfect cab driver doesn't exist.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.430
If it doesn't exist then we invent one.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.555
OK, now! Let's take it easy,

14:01.639 --> 14:04.876
because we have to drive the car.
Good enough,

14:04.960 --> 14:07.675
we've reached the red light, good.
Put your belt on,

14:07.759 --> 14:09.996
fix your chair, position your wing mirrors

14:10.080 --> 14:13.480
and that's good enough,
we can calmly start the class now.

14:16.879 --> 14:17.955
Look, we're going to turn right here,
because we have... Holy shit, Garrido!

14:18.039 --> 14:20.876
Look, we're going to turn right here,
because we have... Holy shit, Garrido!

14:20.960 --> 14:21.919
Was he tailing us?

14:23.480 --> 14:26.036
- What's he doing?
- Nothing, he's provoking you.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.595
I'll drive it's my problem.

14:27.679 --> 14:30.356
Not with your hand like that,
it's probably hurting.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.315
Plaguing of cabbies is what hurts.

14:32.399 --> 14:34.435
- What do I do now?
- Nothing, what!

14:34.519 --> 14:36.636
Start a drag race in Arganzuela?

14:36.720 --> 14:39.516
Let the girl drive,
she's probably better at driving.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.879
- Me? No way!
- Put a cork in it, Dieguito!

14:43.440 --> 14:46.919
Professor, just accelerate,
slowly, like the song.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.120
Hi there. Avenida de America, please.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.200
- What? Shall we drive professor?
- I can't...

15:45.320 --> 15:47.960
I can't seem to
let go of the steering wheel.

15:49.279 --> 15:52.795
No need to get nervouth,
it's all come to nothing in the end.

15:52.879 --> 15:54.116
I know.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.600
Let go, let go. Relax.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.435
Look, professor turn to the right

16:02.519 --> 16:04.715
and stop I'm going into this pharmacy,

16:04.799 --> 16:07.159
to see if we can patch
that iron fist of his.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.675
And how's my dad as an instructor?
Any good?

16:24.759 --> 16:27.200
- Didn't he teach you?
- My dad's like a doctor.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.236
If a surgeon isn't allowed
to operate on family,

16:30.320 --> 16:32.420
he's not allowed
to teach his son to drive.

16:32.799 --> 16:35.960
- But you're a taxi driver, right?
- So?

16:36.399 --> 16:38.396
He probably gave you a few pointers.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.720
My dad being a taxi driver
hasn't made things easier for me.

16:42.399 --> 16:44.099
But you're using his taxi license.

16:44.399 --> 16:47.720
I get it. Following in
one's footsteps isn't always easy.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.279
No.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.276
My dad was a salesman.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.116
You think he took me serious
enough to be a writer?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.759
So, you wanted to be a writer?

16:57.639 --> 16:58.840
No.

16:59.559 --> 17:00.720
So, then?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.600
It doesn't matter.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.995
- That lady wants to get out.
- Well, she's going to have to wait.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.480
We aren't allowed
to drive this thing on our own.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.680
Come on, just move up a few feet.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.235
No we can't, right?

17:18.319 --> 17:21.480
Move it, professor.
No need to get nervouth.

17:34.559 --> 17:35.519
Well then...

17:45.039 --> 17:46.839
No, no! That's our spot!

17:47.480 --> 17:48.880
Our spot?!

17:52.440 --> 17:53.799
I'm not going to park, huh?

17:54.559 --> 17:56.440
Don't worry, I'll help you.

17:56.839 --> 17:59.089
Your dad said,
you can't drive with that hand.

18:00.839 --> 18:03.279
We drive with our feet, not our hands.

18:05.599 --> 18:06.720
Let's go.

18:08.720 --> 18:12.396
- Do you see the end of the other car?
- Yes. I crank it to the right, no?

18:12.480 --> 18:13.440
That's it.

18:15.279 --> 18:16.440
Very good.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.480
Very good, good, good, very good.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.799
Very good. Tire to the curb,
license in your pocket.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.359
Nailed it! See? Easy peasy.

18:33.799 --> 18:35.519
Easy and for the entire family.

18:36.079 --> 18:38.955
Nice job parking, Lopetegui.
Better than me.

18:39.039 --> 18:43.515
But you're taking the test and you've
already taken the mechanics class...

18:43.599 --> 18:47.156
The mechanics class
isn't what you think. It's bullshit.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.435
It's not like you have to repair a car.

18:49.519 --> 18:52.916
At most, they'll ask you where
to find the reflective vest

18:53.000 --> 18:54.680
or where the oil rod goes.

18:55.119 --> 18:57.279
And where is the reflective vest?

18:58.759 --> 19:01.039
I would need a car to explain it to you.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.275
If we had car in front of us right now

19:05.359 --> 19:07.759
would you be able
to give me a mechanics class?

19:08.519 --> 19:11.880
Yes, of course.
But where are we supposed to find a car?

19:12.920 --> 19:13.880
Hello, Ramón.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.836
Hello, Pablo.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.970
I don't have my keys. Do you have a copy?

19:19.480 --> 19:21.880
- Yes, of course.
- Thanks.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.079
- Here you go.
- Fantastic.

19:24.519 --> 19:26.759
Pablo. Just one thing.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.316
I'm not one to pry
into other people's business, but

19:30.400 --> 19:31.920
isn't she a little young?

19:33.119 --> 19:35.480
- Who?
- Her?

19:36.319 --> 19:39.116
- She's my student from the university.
- Even worse.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.715
- You're a married man, Pablo.
- No, not any more.

19:41.799 --> 19:44.559
You don't say. Poor Iria.

19:45.599 --> 19:48.359
Such a fine woman, so pretty.

19:49.319 --> 19:50.759
Same age as you too.

19:51.759 --> 19:53.319
See you later, Ramón.

20:00.319 --> 20:02.200
Why do you have this car?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.559
It was my father's.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.480
And he passed it down
to you who doesn't drive.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.400
The only thing
my father bought for himself.

20:14.759 --> 20:17.799
This car.
And it's the only thing I inherited.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.240
It's like new.

20:23.119 --> 20:26.039
It was his pride and joy,
he was very proud of it.

20:29.480 --> 20:33.240
When I turned 18 my father
took it hard me not getting my license.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.240
And that's why you're doing it now.

20:39.519 --> 20:41.755
Where did you say
the reflective vest goes?

20:41.839 --> 20:44.475
The reflective vest goes in here.

20:44.559 --> 20:46.955
And Lorenzo told me they always

20:47.039 --> 20:50.475
quiz you about the vest
and the triangles,

20:50.559 --> 20:52.319
they go in the trunk.

20:59.000 --> 20:59.960
What's wrong?

21:00.559 --> 21:03.880
- You don't know what's in here?
- The emergency triangles?

21:07.319 --> 21:09.076
So it's yours?

21:09.160 --> 21:10.759
Why did you tell me it wasn't?

21:11.240 --> 21:12.599
What's that doing there?

21:15.119 --> 21:16.839
Can I keep one?

21:17.680 --> 21:19.039
What do you mean one?

21:19.519 --> 21:21.559
There must be like 200.

21:31.799 --> 21:34.640
THE CHANCES OF THE LIVING

21:40.519 --> 21:42.759
Your father was clearly a fan.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.359
I gave him a copy of the book
and he used it to steady the table.

21:49.279 --> 21:51.440
Maybe not as a writer,

21:52.279 --> 21:55.759
but as a son... he really loved you.

22:15.599 --> 22:18.116
- Sign me up.
- To what?

22:18.200 --> 22:19.960
To the next driving test.
