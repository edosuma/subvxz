crawled or slithered or grew

00:08.576 --> 00:10.043
like a fungus.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.445
Something that started small,

00:12.446 --> 00:14.981
got bigger, lurched like a swamp

00:14.982 --> 00:17.050
thing out of the mud and moist

00:17.051 --> 00:19.152
earth and humid
nights of the delta.

00:19.153 --> 00:22.289
Then it took over the world.

00:22.290 --> 00:30.290
So next time some smartass
horrified by our ham-fisted

00:31.399 --> 00:32.598
is America, well, you can always

00:32.600 --> 00:34.934
pipe up that the blues, rock and

01:38.666 --> 01:44.671

middle of downtown Jackson.

01:44.672 --> 01:45.072
Parrish street.

01:45.073 --> 01:46.173
A lot of history.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.840
What did it used to be
like back in the day?

01:47.841 --> 01:49.242
The street was
packed with folks.

01:49.243 --> 01:49.910
Folks all over.

01:49.911 --> 01:52.812
They had their own restaurants,

01:52.813 --> 01:55.882
grocery stores, joints, I mean,

01:55.883 --> 01:56.550
everything happened here that

01:56.551 --> 01:58.685
happened in Jackson for the
African-American community.

01:58.686 --> 02:00.753
The state capital of Jackson,

02:00.754 --> 02:04.691
Mississippi, located along
interstate highway 55, just

02:04.692 --> 02:07.527
outside what's known as
the Mississippi delta.

02:07.528 --> 02:08.761
It's the kind of place that

02:08.762 --> 02:12.499
makes you wonder why did
they make it the capital.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.904
Until you grab hold of what
used to be around here.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.105
Farris street used to be the hub

02:19.106 --> 02:21.007
of African-American
life in this city.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.075
Its black commercial cultural

02:23.076 --> 02:27.947
center, when Dr. King came
to town he came here.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.849
Everybody did.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.885
Medger Evers had a
house upstairs here.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.054
Musicians like Tommy Johnson,

02:35.055 --> 02:37.089
Sonny boy Williamson, too, and

02:37.090 --> 02:38.191
Elmore James all played here and

02:38.192 --> 02:41.794
the likes of Duke Ellington, cab

02:41.795 --> 02:44.464
Callaway, count Basie and Louie

02:44.465 --> 02:45.366
Armstrong took the stage at

02:45.367 --> 02:47.200
places like the crystal palace

02:47.201 --> 02:50.870
ballroom and the Alamo
on Farris street.

02:50.871 --> 02:51.372
What happened?

02:51.373 --> 02:53.039
Where did it all go?

02:53.040 --> 02:57.977
What killed it was immigration.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.546
Once we were able to break out

02:59.547 --> 03:00.147
of our indigenous black owned

03:00.147 --> 03:00.948
businesses, the businesses died.

03:00.949 --> 03:01.949
Great for the black race but

03:01.950 --> 03:03.216
terrible for the black business.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.618
In fact, the only reason you're

03:05.619 --> 03:06.886
coming here right now is you

03:06.887 --> 03:08.821
have two churches, two funeral

03:08.822 --> 03:10.056
homes and the big apple inn.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.758
You will either die, worship or

03:11.759 --> 03:12.925
come to my place to eat.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.628
That's the only... or all three.

03:15.629 --> 03:22.902
Not in that order.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.504
How you doing today?

03:24.505 --> 03:30.910
Back when things were
hopping, Geno Lee's great

03:30.911 --> 03:31.545
grandfather moved to Mississippi

03:31.546 --> 03:33.246
from Mexico City, started a

03:33.247 --> 03:34.681
family with an African-American
woman in Jackson.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.517
He sold hot tamales out of a
steel drum on the corner.

03:37.518 --> 03:42.188
In 1939, he moved the
operation inside, right here.

03:42.189 --> 03:48.127
Now, the last restaurant
on the street.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.829
Lurking inside, waiting for us,

03:49.830 --> 03:52.599
is John T. Edge, who leads the

03:52.600 --> 03:53.467
Southern food ways alliance.

03:53.468 --> 03:55.001
Mr. Edge, how you doing?

03:55.002 --> 03:56.869
Who makes a point, a mission,

03:56.870 --> 03:58.505
out of knowing and teaching as

03:58.506 --> 04:00.206
much as he can about the real

04:00.207 --> 04:01.808
culinary traditions of the

04:01.809 --> 04:04.010
south, and doing what he can to

04:04.011 --> 04:10.717
keep them alive and unmolested.

04:10.718 --> 04:11.718
Look at that.

04:11.719 --> 04:12.353
Awesome.

04:12.354 --> 04:14.621
It's like a cream sandwich.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.190
What you go for here are smokes,

04:18.190 --> 04:20.192
smoked sausage sandwiches and

04:20.192 --> 04:22.228
these magnificent beauties, pig

04:22.229 --> 04:23.496
ear sandwiches called ears, both

04:23.497 --> 04:26.165
pretty much served with the same

04:26.166 --> 04:29.402
garnish of slaw, mustard,
home-made hot sauce on a soft

04:29.403 --> 04:29.970
bun.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.804
As I understand it, originally

04:30.805 --> 04:32.739
this is one of those nobody

04:32.740 --> 04:34.341
wants these things,
they're dirt cheap.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.708
Exactly right.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.644
In fact, by dirt cheap, the ears

04:37.645 --> 04:39.879
were actually free when my great

04:39.880 --> 04:40.814
grandfather started getting the

04:40.815 --> 04:42.181
pig ears, the butcher was giving

04:42.182 --> 04:45.385
them to him because he would
just throw them away.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.986
So everything we love about

04:46.987 --> 04:48.921
pig, the texture, the mix of

04:48.922 --> 04:51.558
fatty and lean, all
that, all that's good.

04:51.559 --> 04:51.725
Mm.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.494
Man.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.562
That is hard to beat.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.497
Isn't it good?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.030
Um-hum.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.399
It's a good sandwich.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.401
Of course, some hot tamales

05:01.402 --> 05:03.169
which at this point in history

05:03.170 --> 05:05.071
are about as Mississippi
as they are Mexican.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.406
Like the blues, they came out of

05:06.407 --> 05:08.207
Mississippi in the early 20th

05:08.208 --> 05:11.678
century as Mexican migrant
workers came in to replace

05:11.679 --> 05:14.013
African-Americans, who were
headed to work in the great

05:14.014 --> 05:17.684
factories and stockyards
of Chicago and Detroit.

05:17.685 --> 05:21.354
Sitting down here, eating

05:21.355 --> 05:23.856
tamales, we can sketch a
history of Mississippi.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.425
That's kind of what I'm most

05:25.426 --> 05:27.193
interested in doing, helping

05:27.194 --> 05:28.061
southerners understand that

05:28.062 --> 05:29.462
their foods are as African as

05:29.463 --> 05:32.865
they are western European.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.967
And hopefully... if not largely,

05:34.968 --> 05:36.569
you know, music and all the

05:36.570 --> 05:38.204
other cultural expressions
of the south.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.772
I think food is a sneaky way of

05:39.773 --> 05:40.907
getting at some of the serious

05:40.908 --> 05:42.809
stuff we've been talking about.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.043
I told you before, I didn't know

05:44.044 --> 05:45.578
what a cool job or what a cool

05:45.579 --> 05:48.481
restaurant I had until
you showed it to me.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.916
I'm just making a living.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.784
Just like a lot of folks
around Mississippi.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.453
We're not trying
to make history.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.488
We're not trying to
increase tourism.

05:55.489 --> 06:00.059
All we're doing is
doing what we do.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.729
There is a discomfort level

06:02.730 --> 06:04.797
about exploring Southern food

06:04.798 --> 06:06.332
race or particularly Mississippi

06:06.333 --> 06:07.234
food race when you're talking

06:07.235 --> 06:08.300
about high end traditional

06:08.301 --> 06:10.069
Southern cooking, you're talking

06:10.070 --> 06:12.071
plantation slavery cooking
because that's where these

06:12.072 --> 06:12.773
recipes came from.

06:12.774 --> 06:14.607
So to revel in that, you don't

06:14.608 --> 06:17.910
want to tumble into nostalgia.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.414
The potential for awkwardness
and offense is enormous.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.482
I want to be careful.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.684
I'm not saying that's what
I want the south to be.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.085
I'm saying that's what people

06:26.086 --> 06:26.687
come to the south looking for.

06:26.688 --> 06:28.421
Right.

06:28.422 --> 06:32.258
They come to the south looking
for the past preserved

06:32.259 --> 06:38.097
but the reality is
something different.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.832
I want it to
progress and change.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.100
I want to document the change

06:41.101 --> 06:44.136
along the way and
celebrate that change.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.606
The burden of race is upon
us and we must shake it.

06:46.607 --> 06:54.607
That can make us better.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.185
I'm a Yankee, so for me, it's

06:59.186 --> 07:01.621
kind of shocking
to see this flag.

07:01.622 --> 07:05.124
It means a lot of things
to a lot of people.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.292
First and foremost meaning I'm

07:06.293 --> 07:11.464
not a Yankee and I don't
much care what you think.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.132
There's no doubt that much of

07:13.133 --> 07:14.701
Mississippi history is ugly,

07:14.702 --> 07:17.470
from slavery which was pretty
much the backbone, the

07:17.471 --> 07:18.638
foundation of industry here from

07:18.639 --> 07:25.244
the get-go, to Jim crow,
lynchings to church burnings.

federal agents, national

07:47.334 --> 07:48.701
guardsmen and military police

07:48.702 --> 07:52.071

07:52.707 --> 07:53.840
A notion that was, shall we say,

07:53.841 --> 07:55.174
less than popular here.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.576
To be honest, that was about all

I had for an image of the
state of Mississippi.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.947

musicians is being able to

10:46.613 --> 10:48.247
really speak truthfully about

10:48.248 --> 10:51.684
what's going on without
fear of reprisal.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.385
It allows the audience to then

10:53.386 --> 10:54.787
say you know what, you're right.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.723
Now that you've put it to a nice

10:56.724 --> 10:58.357
melody or a nice beat or you say

10:58.358 --> 11:01.260
it in that way and hopefully

11:01.261 --> 11:04.931
then that engages them more
and allows them to move.

11:04.932 --> 11:05.866
I don't think any movement in

11:05.867 --> 11:07.433
the world has not had
a sound track, right?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.368
Regardless of what it is.

11:09.369 --> 11:15.074
So that's our job.

11:15.075 --> 11:23.075
♪

11:37.731 --> 11:40.066
Depending on what metrics

11:40.067 --> 11:41.467
you're using, the Mississippi is

11:41.468 --> 11:42.501
somewhere between the tenth and

11:42.502 --> 11:45.171
the fourth largest
river in the world.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.173
One thing for sure, it's big.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.607
And it's freaking strong.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.809
Also, you really got to put your

11:49.810 --> 11:51.010
back into it if you're crazy

11:51.011 --> 11:53.179
enough to want to paddle a canoe

11:53.180 --> 11:55.114
around in its
fast-moving waters.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.649
What's the source
of the Mississippi?

11:57.650 --> 12:05.650
Well, anywhere a raindrop
falls in 44% of America.

12:05.658 --> 12:06.826
If you follow the volume of

12:06.827 --> 12:09.295
water, two-thirds comes down the

12:09.296 --> 12:12.498
Ohio river, but most people will

12:12.499 --> 12:14.333
say a lake in Minnesota.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.837
John Rutski is I guess what
you would call a river rat.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.506
He started the Quawpaw canoe

12:20.507 --> 12:21.707
company, a custom outfit that

12:21.708 --> 12:22.975
leads guided expeditions on the

12:22.976 --> 12:25.111
Mississippi river and
its tributaries.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.846
As a central part of his

12:26.847 --> 12:29.148
operations, he trains local kids

12:29.149 --> 12:30.482
from Mississippi and across the

12:30.483 --> 12:32.018
river in neighboring Arkansas

12:32.019 --> 12:36.288
under an apprentice program,
teaching skills like hand

12:36.289 --> 12:38.190
carving canoes, outdoor survival

12:38.191 --> 12:40.492
and the ins and outs of guiding

12:40.493 --> 12:42.895
and the history of the river.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.798
Most of these kids come from

12:45.799 --> 12:46.533
pretty distressed neighborhoods

12:46.534 --> 12:48.500
and the hope, the intent, is

12:48.501 --> 12:56.501
that once trained up, they
will stay with the company.

12:56.977 --> 13:00.646
Nice paddling, Tony.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.514
You got it down.

13:01.514 --> 13:01.849
Thank you.

Buck island.

13:05.419 --> 13:07.386

13:07.387 --> 13:09.388

13:09.389 --> 13:11.323
river water from April to June

13:11.324 --> 13:15.895

melt and rainstorms.

13:15.896 --> 13:21.067
We do a lot of cooking out here.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.902
Multi-purpose and
indestructible?

13:22.903 --> 13:25.737
Um-hum.

13:25.738 --> 13:26.906
The next step in this thing is

13:26.907 --> 13:29.041
here are the Greens and we

13:29.042 --> 13:30.742
should stuff as many Greens
as we can into that.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.578
This right here?

13:31.578 --> 13:31.879
Yeah.

13:31.880 --> 13:36.883
All right.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.384
So how does your program work?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.585
Around what age are they

13:39.586 --> 13:40.619
generally when they first start?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.888
Teenagers.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.355
As soon as they can
hold a paddle.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.092
The only thing we ask is
interest and commitment.

13:46.093 --> 13:50.196
What does that mean, commitment?

13:50.197 --> 13:51.931
We had respect of yourself,

13:51.932 --> 13:53.432
getting good sleep, eating good

13:53.433 --> 13:54.766
food, especially before
we go on a trip.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.768
Second one is respect of other

13:56.769 --> 13:59.771
people, other paddlers and
of course, the clients.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.608
And the third thing is
taking care of the river.

14:02.609 --> 14:03.943
You know, they have been told by

14:03.944 --> 14:05.811
their parents don't get
on the Mississippi river.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.413
Maybe they don't even
know how to swim.

14:07.414 --> 14:10.382
You know, for a young man or

14:10.383 --> 14:11.284
woman, overcoming a feeling like

14:11.285 --> 14:12.885
that of getting in the canoe and

14:12.886 --> 14:14.253
then to have people come and

14:14.254 --> 14:16.822
appreciate what you're doing is

14:16.823 --> 14:20.292
life-changing experience.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.795
Within that is this incredible

14:23.796 --> 14:26.465
and beautiful spirit that
is intact in the delta.

14:26.466 --> 14:30.169
Sweet potatoes, Greens,

14:30.170 --> 14:33.272
Throw on the corn,
we're getting close.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.941
Finally on the wet logs on top

14:34.942 --> 14:39.245
of glowing coals lay some
steaks, pork loin and pork

14:39.246 --> 14:39.779
tenderloin right on there.

14:39.780 --> 14:45.351

14:57.197 --> 15:01.367

much food for two people.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.303
And yes, that is a whole
hell of a lot of meat.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.306
And I know it would be awful to

15:07.307 --> 15:15.307
waste all that extra
but don't worry.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.019

are tired and hungry.

good, but I'm good.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.733
you had to have enough money to

make it work, so it took
some sort of gamblers.

infuses the place.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.742

21:14.342 --> 21:19.745
It's supposed to look like this.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.179
I moved here from Georgia and

21:21.180 --> 21:22.481
the thing that struck me when I

21:22.482 --> 21:23.749
moved here, driving through the

21:23.750 --> 21:26.418
delta the first time, was
just how empty it was.

21:26.419 --> 21:29.821
Like it's like everybody left.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.256
The great migration.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.858
Three factors.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.526
Automation, the invention of

21:34.527 --> 21:36.562
mechanical means to pick cotton,

21:36.563 --> 21:37.929
the call of better-paying jobs

21:37.930 --> 21:42.167
in the industries of the
north, and of course, freedom.

21:42.168 --> 21:44.770
People think about the
blues as a lament.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.773
A lot of blues songs are about

21:47.774 --> 21:51.009
freedom, about getting the
hell out of Mississippi.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.711
And there were a lot of reasons
to get the hell out of

21:52.712 --> 21:55.080
Mississippi.

21:55.081 --> 21:55.948
For a long time.

21:55.949 --> 21:59.050
Now there's a return migration.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.019
There's that whole period late

22:00.020 --> 22:02.454
'60s, early '70s, where kids are

22:02.455 --> 22:03.789
bugging out of brown university

22:03.790 --> 22:05.624
to come sit at the foot of an

22:05.625 --> 22:07.258
aging blues man in Mississippi.

22:07.259 --> 22:10.362
There's a cyclical
pattern to that.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.430
Now you see people kind of doing

22:11.431 --> 22:12.864
the same thing with food, like

22:12.865 --> 22:13.865
there's a whole generation that

22:13.866 --> 22:16.468
wants to come down here and sit

22:16.469 --> 22:22.207
at the foot of an aged cook.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.775
State senator Willie Simmons

22:23.776 --> 22:25.043
has been an elected official of

22:25.044 --> 22:28.213
the Mississippi
delta for 20 years.

22:28.214 --> 22:35.220
He's been running this place,
senator's place, for 11.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.989
What's the difference between
soul food and Southern,

22:37.990 --> 22:38.558
traditional Southern food?

22:38.559 --> 22:41.159
It depends on the culture and

22:41.160 --> 22:42.160
what neighborhood you were in.

22:42.161 --> 22:46.465
If you were in the black
neighborhood, it became soul.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.333
We probably put a little bit

22:47.334 --> 22:50.602
more of the throwaway in our

22:50.603 --> 22:53.405
cooking, the pig feet, the pig

22:53.406 --> 22:55.974
tail, the neck bones and
all of that's fatty.

22:55.975 --> 23:03.975
Now you're making me hungry.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.353
So Greens... collard Greens.

23:08.354 --> 23:09.821
Have some of that, for sure.

23:09.822 --> 23:10.922
Is that fried okra there?

23:10.923 --> 23:13.959
I'll have a little of that.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.194
Might need more than one
plate at this rate.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.164
Let me get some Mac and cheese.

23:19.165 --> 23:22.100
What's that, Lima beans?

23:22.101 --> 23:22.869
The red bean.

23:22.870 --> 23:24.503
Oh, man, that looks
kind of good, too.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.337
Yeah, little bit of that.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.206
Neck bones floating
around somewhere?

23:28.207 --> 23:28.441
Okay.

23:28.442 --> 23:30.175
Yeah, I'll have some of those.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.043
Little rice and gravy
on there, yeah.

23:31.044 --> 23:35.881
Thanks.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.183
And oh, a piece of
fried chicken there.

23:38.184 --> 23:41.319
If you got a thigh,
that would be great.

23:41.320 --> 23:41.688
Okra's perfect.

23:41.689 --> 23:44.289
Yeah, it is.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.624
Man, that's good.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.626
Now here in the south, if you

23:47.627 --> 23:50.896
want to, you can throw
your fork away and...

23:50.897 --> 23:55.534
I'll be working on that.

23:55.535 --> 23:59.404
We forgive you and don't
hold it against you.

23:59.405 --> 24:03.141
Could eat this okra
all day long, man.

24:03.142 --> 24:03.576
It's good.

24:03.577 --> 24:05.911
I don't know what you
think about those Greens.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.079
They're nice.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.015
That's tasty.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.182
This is the way people get the

24:11.183 --> 24:13.251
credit for Southern
cooking as we know it.

24:13.252 --> 24:13.820
I do.

24:13.821 --> 24:16.254
You think the right
people get the credit?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.255
People know.

24:17.256 --> 24:18.423
People know who's behind this

24:18.424 --> 24:19.491
food, whether it's called soul

24:19.492 --> 24:22.861
food or whether it's
called country cooking.

24:22.862 --> 24:27.032
How is the detail, the mindset
of the delta, different

24:27.033 --> 24:28.166
than the rest of the state?

24:28.167 --> 24:33.404
Nobody else can compare with us.

24:33.405 --> 24:34.773
They have no one who can sit on

24:34.774 --> 24:39.611
top of you and tell you they

24:39.612 --> 24:43.348
represent dockery plantation
where the blues were born.

24:43.349 --> 24:44.283
There's no one else that can

24:44.284 --> 24:49.287
tell you his district is the

24:49.288 --> 24:55.694
home of B.B. King, where
Jared Butler was born.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.228
Or the staples singers.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.130
When we talk about the heritage

24:59.131 --> 25:00.298
and the culture and what comes

25:00.299 --> 25:03.101
out of the delta, that's all

25:03.102 --> 25:06.805
within this district
that I represent.

25:06.806 --> 25:14.806
So Mississippi delta
has that pride.

25:16.816 --> 25:21.486
46 miles southeast is
greenwood, a town with a lot of

25:21.487 --> 25:25.791
history, most of it of
the not good variety.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.560
Known unfortunately as much for

25:28.561 --> 25:30.095
Tom Brady's infamous speech

25:30.096 --> 25:31.429
after brown versus the board of

25:31.430 --> 25:32.998
education as anything else,

25:32.999 --> 25:36.467
fairly or not, it's
hard to get past that.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.503
During all the years of cruelty

25:38.504 --> 25:41.573
and struggle from 1933 on,

25:41.574 --> 25:44.409
through it all, and until today,

25:44.410 --> 25:48.680
this place, Lusco's, was
a beloved institution.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.181
Once a grocery store it turned

25:50.182 --> 25:53.685
restaurant to the moneyed class,

25:53.686 --> 25:54.986
served them in discreet quarters

25:54.987 --> 25:56.755
in the pack where one could

25:56.756 --> 25:57.756
enjoy an alcoholic beverage in

25:57.757 --> 25:59.257
what was then a dry state.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.861
Still going after all
these years, unchanged.

26:02.862 --> 26:03.029
Why?

26:03.030 --> 26:08.466
This place is like a rel
quarter of indiscretions past,

26:08.467 --> 26:09.101
you know?

26:09.102 --> 26:10.969
But maybe to really tell the

26:10.970 --> 26:12.437
story of this place, you have to

26:12.438 --> 26:15.040
start with a story of its most

26:15.041 --> 26:16.541
famous employee, Booker Wright.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.611
He had been working at Lusco's

26:19.612 --> 26:24.783
as a waiter since he
was 14 years old.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.017
I'll be glad to tell you what

26:26.018 --> 26:26.986
they're going to serve tonight.

26:26.987 --> 26:31.723
In 1965, NBC news came to
town, making a documentary on

26:31.724 --> 26:33.558
race relations.

26:33.559 --> 26:34.660
Booker's entertaining recitation

26:34.661 --> 26:37.062
of the menu at Lusco's was

26:37.063 --> 26:38.229
famous around town so they asked

26:38.230 --> 26:45.237
him to do his usual
routine for the camera.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.074
But at the end of his usual

26:49.075 --> 26:50.241
litany is where he dropped the

26:50.242 --> 26:55.546
truth bomb that
nobody was ready for.

26:55.547 --> 27:00.853
Right here.

27:07.994 --> 27:08.661
You have to smile.

27:08.662 --> 27:10.729
If you don't, what's
wrong with you?

27:10.730 --> 27:13.198
The meaner the man be,
the more you smile.

27:13.199 --> 27:16.768
Although you're
crying on the inside.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.203
You don't look for no tips.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.537
Yes, sir, thank you.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.272
What did you say?

27:21.273 --> 27:21.941
Thank you, sir.

27:21.942 --> 27:23.441
That's what you have to go

27:23.442 --> 27:29.114
through here but
remember, keep smiling.

27:29.115 --> 27:33.618
Telling the truth was still
risky business in 1966

27:33.619 --> 27:34.786
Mississippi and Booker Wright

27:34.787 --> 27:37.756
was not rewarded for his candor.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.958
It was not a good
experience for him.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.359
It did not make him a star.

27:41.360 --> 27:48.433
Not within the white community
but even though black

27:48.434 --> 27:49.467
power was first chanted here,

27:49.468 --> 27:50.568
that was less important to the

27:50.569 --> 27:51.437
black community here than what

27:51.437 --> 27:52.138
Booker said on the NBC news.

27:52.139 --> 27:55.640
Yeah.

27:55.641 --> 27:58.543
The private dining rooms
at Lusco's is still here.

27:58.544 --> 28:02.247
The menu, much the same.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.949
Steaks, fish.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.216
The famous broiled shrimp.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.118
The Lusco special salad with the

28:07.119 --> 28:08.954
house Italian vinaigrette

28:08.955 --> 28:14.926
dressing and a healthy dose
of anchovie, onion rings.

28:14.927 --> 28:15.994
Salad makes me happy.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.929
Me, too.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.598
Mostly anchovies make me happy.

28:20.599 --> 28:21.833
Yeah, yeah, love those.

28:21.834 --> 28:26.237
Catfish for Mr. Edge, the
famous pompano for me.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.338
It's kind of the Mark of

28:27.339 --> 28:29.507
being a great restaurant in the

28:29.508 --> 28:31.176
delta if you have pompano.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.078
Big damn fish.

28:32.079 --> 28:34.813
No way I'm finishing this.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.749
Sitting here, the booth, the

28:37.750 --> 28:39.084
curtains, the whole ring bell

28:39.085 --> 28:42.687
for service thing, it
seems lost in time.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.455
We got a long ugly history

28:44.456 --> 28:45.656
but that's one of the things I

28:45.657 --> 28:46.792
love about this place, you can't

28:46.793 --> 28:48.193
deny the burden of the past.

28:48.194 --> 28:48.761
It gets on your shoulder.

28:48.762 --> 28:51.129
It's right there.

28:51.130 --> 28:57.769
America chooses to deny its
problems in many ways.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.206
It declares itself a
post-racial society.

29:11.117 --> 29:19.117
Oxford, Mississippi is a
lovely, eccentric island, a

29:20.126 --> 29:22.227
magnet for writers, thinkers and

29:22.228 --> 29:23.862
oddballs, drawn perhaps by its

29:23.863 --> 29:25.864
rich literary tradition as the

29:25.865 --> 29:29.500
home of one of our greatest
authors, William Faulkner.

29:29.501 --> 29:33.571
Faulkner was a Mississippi
native, a former postman, an

29:33.572 --> 29:34.572
outdoorsman and eventual winner

29:34.573 --> 29:39.077
of the Nobel prize in literature

29:39.078 --> 29:42.881
and two Pulitzer
prizes for fiction.

29:42.882 --> 29:43.850
He never graduated high school.

29:43.851 --> 29:46.051
This was his house, Roanoke.

29:46.052 --> 29:48.186
Faulkner wrote such American

29:48.187 --> 29:48.988
classics as the sound and the

29:48.989 --> 29:52.223
fury, as I lay dying, light in

29:52.224 --> 29:55.593
August and many of his works
took place in a fictional

29:55.594 --> 29:56.694
county, a place very much like

29:56.695 --> 29:58.930
this place, in Mississippi.

29:58.931 --> 30:02.500
This is where Faulkner started
his writing career, in

30:02.501 --> 30:04.269
this room here.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.737
For the past ten years, bill

30:06.738 --> 30:10.675
Griffith has been curator
at Faulkner’s estate.

30:10.676 --> 30:12.844
After he won the Nobel prize,

30:12.845 --> 30:17.715
on the wall here is an outline
of one of his novels.

30:17.716 --> 30:19.350
That was his greatest book.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.920
Faulkner thought that
was his masterpiece.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.122
Jack Pendarvis is the author

30:24.123 --> 30:26.858
of your body is changing, the
mysterious secret of the

30:26.859 --> 30:28.126
valuable treasure and awesome as

30:28.127 --> 30:30.028
well as a staff writer for the

30:30.029 --> 30:32.630
game-changing animated
series adventure time.

30:32.631 --> 30:36.534
All works of which
I am a huge fan.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.568
He wrote right on the wall?

30:37.569 --> 30:38.470
He wrote on it.

30:38.471 --> 30:40.071
It's his man-cave.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.606
It's his version.

30:41.607 --> 30:42.974
He said houses in Mississippi

30:42.975 --> 30:44.375
who have a family business have

30:44.376 --> 30:45.743
one room dedicated to the family

30:45.744 --> 30:48.379
business and this family's
business is writing.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.048
From as early as 1919 through

30:50.049 --> 30:52.583
the early '60s, Faulkner wrote

30:52.584 --> 30:54.552
extensively about the
post-civil war south.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.821
He was the first author to do

30:56.822 --> 30:58.289
so, at a time when most writers

30:58.290 --> 31:02.627
were writing about anything but.

31:02.628 --> 31:06.097
He always said that he wrote
about a south torn between

31:06.098 --> 31:07.298
itself, torn between the old

31:07.299 --> 31:11.002
ways, the old traditional
ways and modern.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.504
He said he would break
the code and he did.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.240
But?

31:15.241 --> 31:17.842
He did.

31:17.843 --> 31:20.345
Yet he had those hobbies and

31:20.346 --> 31:21.013
interests that were definitely

31:21.014 --> 31:25.316
of a gentry class
and gentry nature.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.152
His portrait.

31:26.153 --> 31:27.252
Great example.

31:27.253 --> 31:27.753
And his writing habit.

31:27.754 --> 31:29.454
That's a great example.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.856
You do get to a certain level

31:31.857 --> 31:33.358
of success and all of a sudden,

31:33.359 --> 31:35.826
this seems like a good idea and

31:35.827 --> 31:37.862
it's never a good
idea at that age.

31:37.863 --> 31:38.197
At any age.

31:38.198 --> 31:41.266
Exactly.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.868
Was he politically
active at all?

31:43.869 --> 31:45.503
He was a middle of
the road democrat.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.006
That's what he said.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.508
He said you have to bring
black education up with white

31:50.509 --> 31:52.343
education and since the state of

31:52.344 --> 31:53.544
Mississippi will not invest in

31:53.545 --> 31:57.815
black education it's up
to its citizens to do so.

31:57.816 --> 31:59.217
He said that segregation wasn't

31:59.218 --> 32:00.718
about being right or wrong.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.221
He said any sane, sober
southerner knows that it's

32:03.222 --> 32:03.455
wrong.

32:03.456 --> 32:06.224
It's about wanting
to change or not.

32:06.225 --> 32:09.294
But people don't want
to give up power.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.196
Fear is still alive and
well in Mississippi.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.563
I think racism is one of those

32:12.564 --> 32:14.465
great things in the world that

32:14.466 --> 32:15.866
you'll never solve and that's

32:15.867 --> 32:22.507
why Faulkner wrote about it.

32:22.508 --> 32:26.978
Writers as I know from looking
in my own dark heart,

32:26.979 --> 32:27.713
are generally terrible people.

32:27.714 --> 32:28.714
Put ten of them together and

32:28.715 --> 32:32.750
it's like putting your head
in a bag full of snakes.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.419
I meet a bunch of them above

32:34.420 --> 32:36.921
city grocery, John currant's
place on the square.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.756
There's the brilliant author Tom

32:38.757 --> 32:43.894
Franklin and his wife, the
poet Beth Ann Fennely.

32:43.895 --> 32:46.431
Grisham writers in residence,

32:46.432 --> 32:54.432
Megan Abbott, Pendarvis, a
senior writer for ESPN,

32:56.942 --> 32:58.943
novelist, Ace Atkins.

32:58.944 --> 33:02.713
Poet, Derek Harell is
originally from Milwaukee.

33:02.714 --> 33:08.619
Crime novelist Billy
Boyle from Brooklyn.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.954
Downstairs, currant's restaurant

33:09.955 --> 33:13.124
city grocery cranks out
many delicious things.

33:13.125 --> 33:16.227
The man known as big bad chef,

33:16.228 --> 33:17.628
aka Johnny snack, is sending

33:17.629 --> 33:19.297
some of those goodies upstairs

33:19.298 --> 33:20.531
as there's nothing professional

33:20.532 --> 33:26.737
writers like more
than free food.

33:26.738 --> 33:27.872
Usually you put five writers

33:27.873 --> 33:32.210
in a room, it's an ugly hell
broth of envy, hatred...

33:32.211 --> 33:32.978
We all hate Tommy.

33:32.979 --> 33:35.446
That goes without saying.

33:35.447 --> 33:39.317
I hate me worst of all.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.320
The writers are really
supportive of each other.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.888
For writers to argue would be

33:43.889 --> 33:46.757
like arguing over
a piece of dirt.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.159
What are we fighting about?

33:48.160 --> 33:50.128
The stakes are so low, why would

33:50.129 --> 33:53.098
you be a jerk about it?

33:53.099 --> 33:54.099
If Mississippi were a country

33:54.100 --> 33:57.268
and there were a national hero,

33:57.269 --> 34:00.004
dead or alive, by consensus,

34:00.005 --> 34:00.972
state-wide, who would
the statue be of?

34:00.972 --> 34:01.473
Elvis.

34:01.474 --> 34:07.078
Really?

34:07.079 --> 34:08.146
It wouldn't even be him.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.981
It should be B.B. King.

34:10.982 --> 34:11.350
Yeah.

34:11.350 --> 34:11.983
But it would be Elvis.

34:11.984 --> 34:14.418
It would be Elvis.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.353
Mississippi I you know, the

34:15.355 --> 34:17.355
joke is that it's not a state,

34:17.356 --> 34:20.358
it's a club, that it's so small

34:20.359 --> 34:21.859
that everybody knows everybody.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.862
In the middle of Mississippi,

34:24.862 --> 34:31.202
Oxford is an oasis of thought

34:31.203 --> 34:34.205
and literature and feeling.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.206
The velvet ditch.

34:35.206 --> 34:36.774
Why the velvet ditch?

34:36.775 --> 34:38.943
It's pretty freaking
comfortable.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.846
You don't care much
about getting out.

34:41.847 --> 34:42.148
Right?

34:42.148 --> 34:42.514
Right?

34:42.514 --> 34:43.382
Am I right?

34:43.382 --> 34:45.049
No one here seems too
bitter about that.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.650
It's a place that needs help

34:46.652 --> 34:47.952
but it's a really great place.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.255
We're never leaving.

35:07.473 --> 35:11.242
Is there a distinctive
barbecue style in the state of

35:11.243 --> 35:11.543
Mississippi?

35:11.544 --> 35:12.743
No.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.912
Not that we can really
discern at all.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.682
And it's part of the reason
that we wanted to do this.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.350
We got our hands on this place

35:19.351 --> 35:22.853
and sort of been puzzled for
years of what Mississippi

35:22.854 --> 35:23.555
barbecue is all about.

35:23.556 --> 35:27.658
The more I dug into it, the
less and less I could find.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.394
So what we wanted to do is sort

35:29.395 --> 35:32.062
of take a look at barbecue that

35:32.063 --> 35:33.831
surrounds us and see if we could

35:33.832 --> 35:39.170
sort of Frankenstein barbecue.

35:39.171 --> 35:43.040
Isn't really any fixed idea
of Mississippi barbecue and

35:43.041 --> 35:46.076
other than this place, Lamar

35:46.077 --> 35:49.079
lounge, John currant's not for

35:49.080 --> 35:50.048
profit bar/restaurant, there's

35:50.049 --> 35:55.052
no other pit-smoked barbecue
in the entire state.

35:55.053 --> 35:59.390
A 175 pound pig will
feed many mouths.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.226
About 250 people eat here a day.

36:01.227 --> 36:04.629
This is a not for
profit establishment?

36:04.630 --> 36:04.963
Yeah.

36:04.963 --> 36:05.697
Is that right?

36:05.698 --> 36:07.265
Yeah, it sure is.

36:07.266 --> 36:11.569
What sort of communist
socialist are you up to?

36:11.570 --> 36:11.970
What's going on?

36:11.971 --> 36:13.738
This is the state
of Mississippi.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.105
Just a feel-good type of guy.

36:15.106 --> 36:20.144
Me, too.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.446
I've been here only a week and

36:21.447 --> 36:24.282
my sentences are starting to

36:24.283 --> 36:25.251
change already, because there's

36:25.252 --> 36:26.751
not just a physical rhythm to

36:26.752 --> 36:29.420
the speech, but the way I'm
organizing my thoughts is

36:29.421 --> 36:32.089
starting to change.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.091
Some of the Oxford writers from

36:34.092 --> 36:35.426
last night managed to make it

36:35.427 --> 36:37.262
out of bed, heads pounding no

36:37.263 --> 36:39.464
doubt, filled with the shame and

36:39.465 --> 36:42.333
self-loathing surely
familiar for writers.

36:42.334 --> 36:45.236
But like such greats of the past

36:45.237 --> 36:50.107
as Malcolm Lowery, F. Scott
Fitzgerald, they too have

36:50.108 --> 36:51.276
learned that more alcohol first

36:51.277 --> 36:55.346
thing will often make you
feel better about the world.

36:55.347 --> 36:59.317
Particularly if accompanied
by freshly baked cornbread,

36:59.318 --> 37:00.951
biscuits, pulled pork off that

37:00.952 --> 37:05.790
whole hog, sweet jerk
chicken and brisket.

37:05.791 --> 37:09.960
Hell, I feel better already.

37:09.961 --> 37:10.961
The Mississippi I perceived

37:10.962 --> 37:12.797
is not the Mississippi
I had in my head.

37:12.798 --> 37:15.800
I was surprised how
sold I was off the bat.

37:15.801 --> 37:18.769
If you want to write,
come to Oxford.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.605
You think that's true?

37:20.606 --> 37:21.507
Apparently, yes.

37:21.508 --> 37:25.543
Like that line you can't throw
a rock without hitting a

37:25.544 --> 37:25.811
writer.

37:25.812 --> 37:29.146
Do me a favor, throw it hard.

37:29.147 --> 37:33.484
It's easy to look at
Mississippi and go that just

37:33.485 --> 37:34.719
happens down there
so we're good.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.321
Our hands are clean.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.623
It's a totally
misperceived place.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.991
When I came, I fell in
love with the place.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.493
I never thought that I would.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.661
There's something to it but you

37:43.662 --> 37:49.500
can't put your finger
on what it is.

37:49.501 --> 37:53.037
What it is can be found in
the dark spaces across the

37:53.038 --> 37:56.140
tracks and on the
other side of town.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.910
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.347
Welcome to the lounge
right by the cemetery.

38:02.348 --> 38:10.348
♪

39:27.566 --> 39:30.668
What is a juke joint?

39:30.669 --> 39:32.770
You heard reference to them,
no doubt, but what is it?

39:32.771 --> 39:33.938
I guess the first thing you've

39:33.939 --> 39:39.309
got to know is it's
pronounced juk joint.

39:39.310 --> 39:43.414
And this one is a real good one.

39:43.415 --> 39:47.785
Scholars suggested juk came from

39:47.786 --> 39:50.655
enslaved Africans and it meant

39:50.656 --> 39:57.294
wicked or disorderly, to
dance, or a place of shelter.

39:57.295 --> 40:02.199
Juke joints started in the
plantation community rooms

40:02.200 --> 40:02.668
during slavery times.

40:02.669 --> 40:03.834
They went on to become the

40:03.835 --> 40:05.970
small, private African-American

40:05.971 --> 40:07.304
bars, clubs and lounges.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.974
First in rural areas, then in

40:09.975 --> 40:12.477
towns and cities where workers

40:12.478 --> 40:14.679
could dance, drink, party and

40:14.680 --> 40:16.681
gamble as respite from the hard

40:16.682 --> 40:18.883
labor of sharecropping, tenant

40:18.884 --> 40:21.619
farming, house service
and segregation.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.220
They were often condemned by

40:23.221 --> 40:29.393
church leaders as
houses of the devil.

40:29.394 --> 40:31.829
William runs this place, as he

40:31.830 --> 40:35.833
has since 1963, and
he makes the rules.

40:35.834 --> 40:42.808
How long has this
been in business?

40:42.974 --> 40:45.476
How did you get
into this business?

40:45.477 --> 40:46.911
Something I like to do.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.246
Everybody come in and enjoy
themselves, no problem.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.882
Please explain this policy.

40:51.883 --> 40:58.188
No hats backwards and
no .pants hanging down.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.625
If you don't like the
rules, don't come.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.192
No rap music.

41:02.193 --> 41:08.933
Give me a headache.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.001
I love blues.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.369
Good R&B?

41:12.370 --> 41:13.204
That's right.

41:13.205 --> 41:15.205
But no rap?

41:15.206 --> 41:19.877
If Kanye West wants to rent out

41:19.878 --> 41:21.378
the place you'll rent it to him?

41:21.379 --> 41:27.552
I'll rent it to him.

41:27.553 --> 41:27.953
Thank you, sir.

41:27.954 --> 41:29.954
I love your place and
thank you for having us.

41:29.955 --> 41:31.722
Got to come back again.

41:31.723 --> 41:32.890
I surely will.

41:32.891 --> 41:35.192
I'll find somebody to
get naked with you.

41:35.193 --> 41:38.863
Uh-oh.

41:38.864 --> 41:46.864
Okay, you can kick it back off.

41:48.740 --> 41:52.943
Thursday night is family
night at Po monkeys.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.412
Mostly locals, mixed bag.

41:55.413 --> 42:03.413
The music is classic
R&B and predisco soul.

42:03.789 --> 42:04.656
Attitude, loose.

42:04.657 --> 42:07.725
Just familiarize with those
rules and there won't be a

42:07.726 --> 42:13.130
problem.

42:13.131 --> 42:16.400
In the cities of the north

42:16.401 --> 42:17.434
where I come from, in some ways

42:17.435 --> 42:21.639
we've been able to buy
ourselves free from our past.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.909
New arrivals pour in with no

42:24.910 --> 42:27.845
member of the ugly
parts of our history.

42:27.846 --> 42:30.414
We can afford the
luxury of the new.

42:30.415 --> 42:33.117
We can live in comfortable

42:33.118 --> 42:36.286
bubbles, our apartments
high in the sky.

42:36.287 --> 42:39.323
In many way, more separate
than at anytime in history.

42:39.324 --> 42:43.961
But for Mississippi, the
past is right there to see.

42:43.962 --> 42:48.132
Still present, and coming to
terms with it, not through

42:48.133 --> 42:53.304
abstract discussion, but the
daily business of life.
