Well, on the whole,
I enjoy my job as a pharmacist.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.790
In fact, many of my customers
are your mommies and daddies.

00:39.873 --> 00:43.293
Jimmy Hopkins, your mother had
awful postpartum depression

00:43.377 --> 00:44.378
after you were born.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.463
And Danielle,
your father had bad

00:46.547 --> 00:49.466
very bad hemorrhoids
that stung him unmerciful.

00:49.550 --> 00:50.884
Oh, they were awful.

00:50.968 --> 00:54.137
They were like
stinky little balloons. Oh!

00:54.221 --> 00:56.849
And I gave him
some special ointment

00:56.932 --> 00:58.684
and he hurt so bad

00:58.767 --> 01:01.895
that he had to apply it
in the car with his sock.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.273
Thank you.

01:04.356 --> 01:05.649
Cool! I want to be
a pharmacist.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.900
Oh, yeah!

01:06.984 --> 01:08.151
Thank you, Mr. Goldman.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.195
And our final speaker
is Mr. Peter Griffin.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.321
Yay!

01:11.405 --> 01:12.739
Hey, kids!

01:12.823 --> 01:14.449
Hey, hey, you know what I do?

01:14.533 --> 01:17.327
I work in a toy factory,
and you know what I do there?

01:17.411 --> 01:20.581
I bet you're just one of those
low-level assembly line guys

01:20.664 --> 01:23.125
who stand there all day,
screwing heads on dolls!

01:23.208 --> 01:24.251
"Ooh, is it on straight?

01:24.334 --> 01:25.335
I don't know."

01:25.460 --> 01:26.712
Boo!

01:26.795 --> 01:28.046
Why you little
snot-nosed...!

01:28.130 --> 01:29.965
Mr. Griffin!

01:30.048 --> 01:32.092
( quietly ): He plays kickball in
the park after school.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.302
Get him there.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.761
So does anyone
have any question?

01:34.845 --> 01:37.347
Yeah. Can we listen
to the claims adjuster again?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.932
( cheering )

01:42.769 --> 01:44.897
MAN ( over TV ): Welcome back
to Quahog Five News.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.190
And now,
here's Ollie Williams

01:46.273 --> 01:48.192
with the Blaccu-Weather
forecast. Ollie?

01:48.275 --> 01:49.401
It's going to rain!

01:49.484 --> 01:50.485
Thanks, Ollie.

01:50.569 --> 01:51.820
And finally, we go live

01:51.904 --> 01:53.280
to Asian reporter,
Tricia Takanawa

01:53.363 --> 01:55.490
interviewing a guy from
the upcoming Renaissance Faire.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.575
Tricia?

01:56.658 --> 01:57.910
Thanks, Tom.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.203
Sir, for those viewers

01:59.286 --> 02:01.121
who aren't familiar
with the tradition

02:01.205 --> 02:03.332
can you tell us about
the Renaissance Faire?

02:03.415 --> 02:05.334
Yea, but first,
bride of Ghengis

02:05.417 --> 02:06.919
thou must explainest to me

02:07.002 --> 02:09.129
thy very peculiar
electronic wand.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.840
( eerily ):
Ooh!

02:11.924 --> 02:14.551
All right, Rupert, are you ready
to hear our Mad Lib?

02:14.635 --> 02:15.969
( clears throat )

02:16.053 --> 02:19.181
"Cinderella had three wicked
stepwatermelons

02:19.264 --> 02:21.475
who were very smelly
to her

02:21.558 --> 02:25.604
so her fairy god toilet
turned a pumpkin into a fanny..

02:25.687 --> 02:27.731
and sent her off to the poop.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.775
( laughing )

02:29.858 --> 02:32.528
Oh, my, how ruthlessly absurd!

02:32.611 --> 02:34.238
LOIS:
Peter!

02:34.321 --> 02:36.323
How was your big presentation
at Chris' class?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.116
Oh, it was a huge waste of time.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.535
Well, it couldn't
have been that bad.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.203
Oh, it was terrible.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.121
Everyone else there had
some big, important job

02:43.205 --> 02:44.915
and was way more successful
than me.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.500
Hey, come on,
y-y-you have...

02:46.583 --> 02:48.001
you have a great job.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.587
Yeah. You-You're doing...
you're doing...

02:50.671 --> 02:51.797
you're doing good.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.465
Peter, if you're
not satisfied

02:53.549 --> 02:54.758
then be more assertive.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.260
Invite Mr. Weed
over for dinner

02:56.343 --> 02:58.595
and show him what
you have to offer the company.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.680
Yeah, I guess I could.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.181
I just hope it goes okay.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.016
We've had some bad luck
with dinner guests.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.810
You remember when Margot Kidder
was here?

03:04.893 --> 03:07.646
Oh, we loved you
in the Superman movies.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.398
You were just wonderful!

03:09.481 --> 03:11.692
( hysterical screaming )

03:17.072 --> 03:19.783
( continues screaming )

03:22.119 --> 03:24.746
Mr. Weed, I, uh, was wondering
if maybe you'd like

03:24.830 --> 03:27.416
to come over to my house
for dinner Friday night.

03:27.499 --> 03:28.792
Huh. That wasn't so hard.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.002
WEED:
Well, what time?

03:30.085 --> 03:31.420
Uh, I don't know.
7:30, 8:00?

03:31.503 --> 03:32.629
Fabulous!

03:32.713 --> 03:33.714
What shall I bring?

03:34.965 --> 03:35.966
Peter, calm down.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.384
Everything's going to be fine.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.011
Ah, I hope so,
'cause if I blow this

03:39.094 --> 03:40.762
I'm going to have to go back
to my old job

03:40.846 --> 03:41.930
at the "Electric Company."

03:42.014 --> 03:44.641
( simple, rhythmic tune )

03:48.103 --> 03:49.229
Bet. I-I knew that.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.439
Slow it down,
will you?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.234
Pit. Come on, pal,
it's my first day.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.613
Oh, that's it, buddy!

03:57.696 --> 03:58.822
( grunting )

03:58.906 --> 04:00.532
( choking )

04:00.616 --> 04:01.617
( doorbell rings )

04:01.700 --> 04:02.951
That must be him.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.536
Oh, God! I hope that thing
doesn't happen

04:04.620 --> 04:05.954
where I get nervous

04:06.038 --> 04:07.539
and I can't control
the volume of my voice.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.333
Hello, Peter.
How are you?

04:09.416 --> 04:10.542
( yelling :
Fine!

04:10.626 --> 04:11.752
( softly ):
Please come in.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.505
It's so nice to have
you over, Mr. Weed.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.256
Thank you,
Mrs. Griffin.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.634
I understand that you have
a beautiful family.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.595
Yes, we do, but the children
won't be joining us for dinner.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.804
It's almost
their bedtime.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.140
( blows tuning whistle )

04:27.559 --> 04:28.560
State your names.

04:28.644 --> 04:29.686
Meg.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.771
Chris.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.064
And I'm Liesl.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.774
Mr. Weed, the
Griffin children

04:33.857 --> 04:35.692
would like to say
good night to you.

would also have
the culinary skills

06:05.240 --> 06:06.408
of Emeril Lagasse?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.993
Oh, well, thank you.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.161
Bam!

06:09.244 --> 06:10.245
( laughing )

06:10.329 --> 06:11.330
Oh...

06:11.413 --> 06:12.414
( clears throat )

06:12.497 --> 06:14.541
Peter, don't you
have something to say to Mr. Weed?

06:14.625 --> 06:15.751
Oh, yeah.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.211
Uh, Mr. Weed

06:17.294 --> 06:18.962
I don't care what
the guys at work say.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.380
I never thought

06:20.464 --> 06:21.882
you were an
effeminate weirdo.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.510
Uh-uh, so, uh, wh-what kind
of a name is "Weed"?

06:24.593 --> 06:27.095
They gave it to my grandfather
on Ellis Island.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.389
Our original name was
Bermudagrass.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.684
Peter, being here
with your wonderful family

06:32.768 --> 06:36.063
your beautiful home
and your funny-talking dog

06:36.146 --> 06:37.231
well, I'm impressed.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.941
In fact, starting Monday

06:39.024 --> 06:40.609
I would like to promote you
to Head of Toy Development.

06:40.692 --> 06:41.693
( coughs )

06:41.777 --> 06:42.903
Holy crap!

06:42.986 --> 06:44.780
Ah, thanks, Mr. Weed!
Oh, you won't be sorry!

06:44.863 --> 06:46.406
( gasping )

06:46.490 --> 06:48.408
Brian, quit it.
You're embarrassing me here.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.160
Peter, Brian's choking!

06:50.244 --> 06:52.412
Do the Heimlich maneuver!
Quick!

06:52.496 --> 06:53.539
( spits )

06:53.622 --> 06:54.998
( choking )

06:55.082 --> 06:56.792
( yells )

06:58.085 --> 06:59.253
He's dead!

06:59.336 --> 07:00.921
( both gasp )

07:01.004 --> 07:02.714
( screaming )

07:02.798 --> 07:04.216
Forgot my purse.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.134
( continues screaming )

07:08.470 --> 07:11.682
Let's not panic!
Nobody even knows yet.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.850
MAN:
Police!

07:12.933 --> 07:14.017
Random Dead Body Search!

07:14.101 --> 07:15.686
Oh, my God,
Lois, stall them!

07:15.769 --> 07:17.020
Peter, what are you doing?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.648
Just-just stall them, Lois!

07:19.731 --> 07:21.859
( flushing )

07:21.942 --> 07:23.861
Ha, ha! Gotcha!

07:23.944 --> 07:24.945
It's just me, Death.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.029
I'm here for the body.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.865
Oh, Peter, it's okay.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.949
It's just Death.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.492
Ah, thank God!

07:30.576 --> 07:32.369
Uh, hey, did someone choke
on a roll in here?

07:32.452 --> 07:33.829
Oh, no, no, no,
I-I-I spit it up.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.248
Oh.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.457
Recapping our top story:

07:37.541 --> 07:39.209
Doreen,
I lost your phone number.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.878
We met at the Sky Lounge
last night.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.254
Please call me.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.631
In other news,
toy industrialist, Jonathan Weed

07:44.715 --> 07:47.134
was found dead last night
in the home of an employee

07:47.217 --> 07:49.094
who claims Weed choked
on a dinner roll.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.388
No charges will be filed
against the employee

07:51.471 --> 07:53.849
but the dinner roll has been
taken into police custody.

08:00.522 --> 08:03.275
I'd do her, do her,
wouldn't do her...

08:03.358 --> 08:05.194
uh, who hasn't done her!

08:05.277 --> 08:08.238
Do her, lose the pigtails
and we'll talk.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.573
Do her, do her...

08:09.656 --> 08:12.284
And now, the last man to
see Jonathan Weed alive

08:12.367 --> 08:14.036
has offered to say
a few words.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.954
Good afternoon, everyone.

08:16.038 --> 08:18.457
As you know,
we of the Christian faith

08:18.540 --> 08:21.126
believe that Jesus
is not really dead

08:21.210 --> 08:24.880
but that he must let the world
think that he is dead...

08:24.963 --> 08:28.342
until he can find a way
to control the raging spirit

08:28.425 --> 08:29.885
that dwells within him.

08:29.968 --> 08:33.013
( humming ominous tune )

08:35.140 --> 08:36.808
Anyway, right before he died

08:36.892 --> 08:39.686
uh, Mr. Weed promoted me
to Head of Toy Development

08:39.770 --> 08:42.272
and I've brought along
my attorney who confirms

08:42.356 --> 08:44.608
that this constitutes
a verbal contract.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.776
Isn't that right, Saul?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.528
Yes, sir.
Verbal contract.

08:47.611 --> 08:48.612
Thank you.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.741
Glad to see you all
found your way over from the cemetery.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.743
I'm Leonard Hale,
Mr. Weed's lawyer.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.287
We found this tape among
Mr. Weed's personal effects

08:57.371 --> 08:59.164
with instructions
that it be screened

08:59.248 --> 09:00.916
immediately following
his funeral.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.417
Enjoy.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.544
MAN ( singsong ):
Good morning!

09:03.627 --> 09:05.170
Camera time.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.172
Turn that off. I don't have
my face on yet. I'm ugly.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.632
You want to tell
us a little something

09:08.715 --> 09:09.967
about what you're
making there?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.927
I will tell you,
it's just a couple of eggs

09:12.010 --> 09:13.679
with the peppers left over
from last night.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.972
( both chuckle mischievously)

09:15.055 --> 09:16.598
Yes. Okay, now playtime is over.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.975
Turn it off, monkey, okay?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.602
( clears throat )

09:20.686 --> 09:21.854
Hello, friends.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.814
If you are watching this,
I am dead

09:23.897 --> 09:25.566
and I bet you're pretty bummed.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.693
But I have good news.
Yeah?

09:27.776 --> 09:31.321
The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory
shall be torn down to make way

09:31.405 --> 09:33.782
for the Happy-Go-Lucky
Terminal Disease Institute.

09:33.866 --> 09:34.908
What?!

09:34.992 --> 09:35.993
The demolition

09:36.076 --> 09:37.411
will begin in... now.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.835
Okay, we've got
your typing test here

09:44.918 --> 09:48.172
and all the pertinent data
about your, um...

09:48.255 --> 09:51.592
um, you know,
your background and-and, um...

09:51.675 --> 09:52.801
uh, skills...

09:52.885 --> 09:55.012
and...

09:55.095 --> 09:56.555
And?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.849
You know, I-I got
to be honest with you.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.018
I-I only have
another week and a half here

10:01.101 --> 10:03.061
and I-I have completely
checked out.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.146
Oh.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.772
Yeah.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.691
Well, what should I do?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.235
Um...

10:10.319 --> 10:12.237
( blowing softly )

10:12.321 --> 10:14.156
Chef?

10:20.037 --> 10:21.663
Oh, sorry, we're
out of towels.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.457
Uh, l-let me get
that for you, sir.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.042
( blowing loud)

10:28.921 --> 10:30.672
( gasping )

10:42.643 --> 10:44.603
What, I'm supposed to pay
two bucks for stickers

10:44.686 --> 10:45.687
'cause this guy can't hear?!

10:45.771 --> 10:47.105
Come on!

10:47.189 --> 10:48.524
Hey, I might be deaf,
but I have feelings!

10:48.607 --> 10:51.109
Oh, uh, I-I mean...

10:51.193 --> 10:53.153
What?

10:53.237 --> 10:55.405
Has Dad found
a permanent job yet?

10:55.489 --> 10:58.742
Meg, your father's going through
a bit of a career transition.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.410
He's just sampling
a few things

11:00.494 --> 11:03.247
searching for something
that fits him just right.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.041
Well, clearly it's
not that tube top.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.418
Hey, looking for a good time,
sweet cheeks?

11:08.502 --> 11:09.878
Oh, my God!

11:09.962 --> 11:11.630
Peter, get in the car!

11:11.713 --> 11:14.716
Okay, but it'll cost you.
You want a Cleveland Steamer?

11:14.800 --> 11:17.469
I said, get in the ca...
What's a Cleveland Steamer?

11:17.553 --> 11:19.388
-It means that he'll...
-Whoa, whoa. Be cool. Be cool.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.808
Yes, you go to Maple Street
and then take a left

11:22.891 --> 11:24.935
and then, uh...
you go, uh...

11:25.018 --> 11:26.311
Okay, so you want a party
or what?

11:26.395 --> 11:27.688
Get in this car right now!

11:30.816 --> 11:32.401
It's eerie, isn't it?

11:32.484 --> 11:34.278
Like looking into the future.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.780
MAN: Forgetful Freddy

11:36.864 --> 11:37.948
was so forgetful...

11:38.031 --> 11:39.533
AUDIENCE:
How forgetful was he?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.201
He was so forgetful

11:41.285 --> 11:43.120
whenever he tried
to remember someone's name

11:43.203 --> 11:44.997
he drew a... blank.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.543
Oh, God, this
is all my fault.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.003
If I hadn't
pushed you so hard

11:51.086 --> 11:52.546
to invite Mr. Weed
to dinner

11:52.629 --> 11:53.672
he'd still be alive

11:53.755 --> 11:55.048
and you'd still
have your job.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.009
Don't worry, Lois,
we'll get through this.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.011
We-we just have to scrimp
a little, that's all.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.013
You know, sell some stuff
we don't really need.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.556
This will bring in
a couple of bucks.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.183
Peter, please,
listen to me!

12:04.266 --> 12:05.601
When we got married

12:05.684 --> 12:07.311
you always talked
about your one dream job.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.896
Remember?

12:08.979 --> 12:10.522
And you put that
dream aside

12:10.606 --> 12:12.107
in order to provide
for this family.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.317
Yeah?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.526
Well, I've saved
some money

12:14.610 --> 12:15.986
from teaching piano

12:16.069 --> 12:17.738
and I say, this is
the perfect time

12:17.821 --> 12:19.114
for you to pursue
that dream.

12:19.198 --> 12:20.407
-Really?
-Yes!

12:20.532 --> 12:22.910
Wow. You know,
s-since money's getting tight

12:22.993 --> 12:24.703
I was going to suggest
that we eat the kids.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.288
You know, I mean,
like jokingly at first

12:26.371 --> 12:28.040
but then I was going
to gauge your reaction

12:28.123 --> 12:29.416
and-and if you
were cool with it

12:29.499 --> 12:31.126
then, uh, you know,
we could go from there

12:31.210 --> 12:32.461
but this is
a much better idea.

12:32.544 --> 12:33.879
I'm going to do it, Lois!

12:33.962 --> 12:35.380
I'm going to realize my dream!

12:35.464 --> 12:38.550
I am going to be
a Renaissance Faire jouster.

12:38.634 --> 12:40.969
Oh, Peter!

12:41.053 --> 12:42.804
( screams )

12:46.558 --> 12:48.101
LOIS:
Oh, this is so exciting!

12:48.185 --> 12:49.895
My little jousters
first day.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.146
Here's your lunch.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.523
Thanks, honey.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.982
Oh, egg salad?!

12:54.066 --> 12:55.234
Have a good time.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.777
Yeah, I'll try.

12:58.862 --> 12:59.988
Hey, Mort!

13:00.072 --> 13:01.573
Oh God, don't hurt me!

13:01.657 --> 13:03.242
Oh, hi, Peter.

13:03.325 --> 13:05.118
Hey, you're going to
be a jouster, too?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.621
Yes, I'm trying to overcome
my fear of swords

13:07.704 --> 13:10.457
because a man in a pirate suit
stabbed me in the ear

13:10.541 --> 13:11.708
when I was five.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.627
And then again when I was 30.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.003
What about you, the same?

13:15.087 --> 13:16.255
Nah, not really.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.258
It kind of all goes back
to when I was 18.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.468
I was going through that
rebellious phase and, uh...

13:21.552 --> 13:23.762
I was hanging out
with a bad crowd.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.556
Here, Peter.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.807
Try one of these.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.975
What is it?

13:28.058 --> 13:30.143
It's a cheeseburger.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.896
( laughter )

13:32.980 --> 13:35.107
Of course, now I know
it wasn't a cheeseburger.

13:35.190 --> 13:39.611
But at that time, I was ready
to believe anything.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.864
I didn't know what the hell
was going on.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.365
I wandered around for hours

13:43.448 --> 13:45.158
and somehow ended up
at the Renaissance Faire.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.160
I can fly!

13:47.244 --> 13:48.537
Oh my God!

13:52.249 --> 13:55.210
I was saved by the one
and only Black Knight

13:55.294 --> 13:57.296
of the Quahog Renaissance
Faire.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.839
A word of advice:

13:58.922 --> 14:01.300
the path to knighthood is paved
with strength and nobility

14:01.383 --> 14:05.053
not LSD and sideburns.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.264
And from that moment on,
I knew someday

14:07.347 --> 14:10.309
I wanted to be a knight
like him.

14:10.392 --> 14:14.229
Ah, mercy, I was once addicted
to antihistamines.

14:14.313 --> 14:17.608
I took so many I thought
I was Mr. Peanut.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.610
Ah, that's a
great story, too.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.613
So, you all think you got
what it takes to be jousters?!

14:22.696 --> 14:24.907
If you're going to joust,
you got to want it!

14:24.990 --> 14:26.533
Let me hear your war cry!

14:26.617 --> 14:28.160
Ehhhh, uhhhh...

14:28.243 --> 14:30.329
Is that the best you got,
you pile of crap?!

14:30.412 --> 14:32.080
Yes.

14:32.164 --> 14:34.708
From an early age, my parents
discouraged loud noises...

14:34.791 --> 14:35.959
You know what you are?

14:36.043 --> 14:37.044
You're a candy-assed
maggot!

14:37.127 --> 14:38.504
( chuckling )

14:38.587 --> 14:40.130
-You find something funny, maggot?!
-Sir, no sir!

14:40.214 --> 14:42.257
You love the Middle Ages,
don't you?!

14:42.341 --> 14:43.383
Sir, yes, sir!

14:43.467 --> 14:45.469
The concept of a
geocentric universe

14:45.552 --> 14:47.513
gets you sexually
excited, doesn't it!

14:47.596 --> 14:48.680
Sir, yes, sir!

14:48.764 --> 14:50.224
You want to make

14:50.307 --> 14:51.934
16th Century mathematician
Johannes Kepler

14:52.017 --> 14:53.227
your bitch,
don't you!

14:53.310 --> 14:54.561
Sir, yes, sir!

14:54.686 --> 14:55.687
Welcome, apprentices!

14:55.771 --> 14:56.897
( gasps )

14:56.980 --> 14:57.981
It's him!

14:58.065 --> 14:59.399
Look alive, ladies.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.568
Allow me to introduce
the best of the best:

15:01.652 --> 15:03.195
the Black Knight himself!

15:04.655 --> 15:07.199
And this is his trophy wench,
Maid Madeline!

15:14.581 --> 15:15.874
Ding.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.922
Uh, excuse me, uh,
Mister Black Knight?

15:22.005 --> 15:23.507
I'm busy.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.133
Oh, well, uh, I-I just wanted
to thank you.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.385
I, I don't know
if you remember

15:26.468 --> 15:28.095
but, uh, when I was a kid
you helped me

15:28.178 --> 15:29.763
get my life back
on the right path.

15:29.847 --> 15:31.056
Ah!

15:31.139 --> 15:32.307
Damn it!

15:32.391 --> 15:33.684
Look, I'm busy, all right?!

15:33.767 --> 15:34.852
Oh, okay, I'll
come back later.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.436
Damn rookies.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.439
Are all the other men out of
the shower yet?

15:42.901 --> 15:44.111
Hey, you, Porker.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.071
Yes, I'm calling you a porker

15:46.154 --> 15:47.865
and there's nothing
you can do about it

15:47.948 --> 15:49.032
because I'm protected

15:49.116 --> 15:50.826
by my impenetrable
cereal box fort.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.286
( evil laugh )

15:52.411 --> 15:53.453
Hey, you, Drunky.

15:53.537 --> 15:54.538
Yes, that's right.

15:54.663 --> 15:55.789
I'm calling you Drunky

15:55.873 --> 15:57.082
and there's nothing
you can do about it

15:57.165 --> 15:58.208
because I'm protect...

15:58.292 --> 15:59.293
Ah!

15:59.376 --> 16:01.545
Oh, the toast is ready.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.796
PETER:
I'll get it, Lois.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.135
There you go.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.929
Uh, Peter, maybe you shouldn't
bring your lance to the table.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.514
Lois, if I'm going
to get good enough

16:12.598 --> 16:13.932
to impress the
Black Knight

16:14.016 --> 16:15.475
my lance must be
with me at all times.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.102
Aw, you guys are
going to be so proud

16:17.186 --> 16:18.812
when you see me
out on that field.

16:18.896 --> 16:20.898
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go practice.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.858
( screaming in pain )

16:22.941 --> 16:23.984
Ow, Dad, my earring!

16:24.067 --> 16:26.445
Stop! Ah!

16:27.779 --> 16:30.032
Uh, yeah, two mutton joints,
please.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.867
Oh, thou wishest to feast

16:31.950 --> 16:34.286
on the appendage
of the humble ovine.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.830
Listen, you freak, we don't
all watch Frasier, okay?

16:36.914 --> 16:39.166
Now give me two mutton joints.

16:39.249 --> 16:40.667
Thank you!

16:53.889 --> 16:57.142
'Tis a glorious afternoon,
wouldst thou not agree?

16:57.226 --> 16:59.978
Uh, uh, uh...
yea, kind shrew.

17:00.062 --> 17:05.484
Uh, I... before...
thee... except after C."

17:05.567 --> 17:08.779
Wouldst thou take a gander
underneath my frock?

17:08.862 --> 17:10.572
Uh... uh, sure.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.115
Whatever floats
your boat.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.579
There you go.

17:17.663 --> 17:18.872
Geez, freaking perverts.

17:18.956 --> 17:20.123
Madeline!

17:20.207 --> 17:22.042
Go wait in the Hyundai!

17:22.125 --> 17:23.752
What were you doing
with my girl?!

17:23.836 --> 17:25.754
Huh? Oh, oh, geez.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.923
She walks over here and asks me
to put a bird in her panties.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.633
I'm standing here going,
"What the hell?"

17:29.716 --> 17:30.717
( grunts ) Oh, God!

17:30.801 --> 17:31.885
Peter, play dead!

17:31.969 --> 17:33.178
Curl up in an ass-ball
or something!

17:33.262 --> 17:34.888
What-what's the problem, B.K.?

17:34.972 --> 17:35.973
I don't like you.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.432
I don't like your face

17:37.516 --> 17:39.268
and I don't like you
hanging around my girl.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.270
I don't ever want to see you
here again.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.563
Oh.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.356
Okay, so we, but we
can see each other

17:44.439 --> 17:45.983
outside the
fair, right?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.651
I'm just trying to understand
the rules here.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.945
If I see you again,
I'll kill you.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.321
Okay, that's much clearer.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.701
Oh God, I think
I just miscarried!

17:58.370 --> 18:00.205
Peter, what
are you doing?

18:00.289 --> 18:03.000
I spent hours soldering that
costume for you.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.626
I don't need it anymore, Lois.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.711
I quit the team.

18:05.794 --> 18:07.004
Quit the team?

18:07.087 --> 18:08.630
But you can't
quit jousting.

18:08.714 --> 18:09.882
The big meet is today

18:09.965 --> 18:10.966
and I thought you were..

18:11.049 --> 18:12.050
( laughing )

18:12.134 --> 18:13.135
Did you just say "big meet?"

18:13.218 --> 18:14.636
( giggling )

18:14.720 --> 18:15.888
Oh my God,
I did.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.097
( laughter )

18:17.181 --> 18:19.766
Oh, we almost
missed that one.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.143
I know, that was a close one.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.187
But I'm being
serious here, Peter.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.272
We were all set
to come see you joust today.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.607
You were so excited

18:26.690 --> 18:28.692
to be on the same field
as the Black Knight.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.653
Well, I'm going to be watching
it from the stands, Lois.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.072
Because the Black Knight is just
a big jerk.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.991
Just like that guy
who fixed our vacuum.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.951
There you go,
all fixed.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.537
Turns out a half-eaten meatball
was clogging up the intake.

18:40.621 --> 18:41.997
Oh.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.624
Well, did you save it?

18:43.707 --> 18:44.833
Uh, no.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.127
You bastard.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.716
DIANE: Well, it's
an exciting day for all

18:52.799 --> 18:54.259
here at the Renaissance Faire
jousting meet.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.469
Wouldn't you
say, Tom?

18:55.552 --> 18:57.095
Diane, I'd say
it was a perfect day

18:57.179 --> 18:59.723
if you weren't reminding us all
of our grandmothers' cleavage.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.099
Now let's go live to the field

19:01.183 --> 19:02.559
where the Black Knight is
preparing

19:02.643 --> 19:03.852
to challenge his next opponent.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.314
( bugles blowing )

19:11.818 --> 19:13.695
( cheering )

19:13.779 --> 19:16.240
( chanting ):
♪♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪♪

19:16.323 --> 19:17.449
♪♪ Hey! ♪♪

19:17.533 --> 19:20.994
♪♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪♪

19:21.078 --> 19:22.454
♪♪ Hey! ♪♪

19:22.538 --> 19:24.164
Hey.

19:24.248 --> 19:27.000
How you doing there, big guy?

19:27.084 --> 19:29.670
You holding up all right?

19:29.753 --> 19:32.798
You want a soda?

19:35.592 --> 19:37.094
Ah, screw it, I tried.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.887
The Black Knight's
next challenger will be

19:39.096 --> 19:40.389
Sir Mort Goldman.

19:44.852 --> 19:46.061
( whimpering )

19:50.148 --> 19:51.692
Oh God, I forfeit!

19:52.150 --> 19:53.652
TOM:
Well, that's it, folks.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.988
It looks like the Black Knight
is out of challengers

19:56.071 --> 19:57.781
and is once again undefeated.

19:57.865 --> 20:00.075
Hey, what's your fat ass
doing here?

20:00.158 --> 20:02.202
He's my only means
of conveyance.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.705
But I guess I do spoil him.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.956
Clearly, you do.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.958
And what are you doing here,
Griffin?

20:08.041 --> 20:10.502
I thought I told you never
to show your face here again!

20:10.586 --> 20:11.587
Hey, we're just watching.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.005
I don't want any trouble.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.756
Well, you got trouble
if you don't beat it.

20:14.840 --> 20:15.841
Listen, buddy...

20:15.924 --> 20:17.426
I said, get lost!

20:18.302 --> 20:19.303
Where's he going?

20:19.386 --> 20:20.554
Dad!

20:20.637 --> 20:21.763
Let him go, kids.

20:21.847 --> 20:22.931
You see that, kids?

20:23.015 --> 20:24.975
Your father's nothing
but a fizzle!

20:25.058 --> 20:27.895
Nobody calls me a fizzle
and gets away with it!

20:29.146 --> 20:30.147
( crowd gasps )

20:30.230 --> 20:31.231
Except that one guy

20:31.315 --> 20:32.357
who called me a fizzle

20:32.441 --> 20:33.483
and-and then ran off.

20:33.567 --> 20:34.568
He got away with it.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.903
But most people

20:35.986 --> 20:37.738
who call me a fizzle don't
get away with it!

20:37.821 --> 20:40.240
Well, actually, that guy
who got away with it was

20:40.324 --> 20:42.034
the only one
who ever called me a fizzle.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.785
After today,
only half the people

20:43.869 --> 20:46.622
who ever called me a fizzle will
have gotten away with it!

20:46.705 --> 20:49.041
It appears a new challenger has
entered the field.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.751
The crowd has fallen
deathly ill.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.169
Silent. Sorry.

21:06.642 --> 21:08.393
Oh my God, I'm going to die!

21:08.477 --> 21:10.687
Oh, ah, ah, to the owner
of a yellow Hyundai--

21:10.771 --> 21:11.855
your car is being towed.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.774
What?!

21:15.108 --> 21:16.527
I won!

21:16.610 --> 21:17.611
( cheering )

21:17.694 --> 21:19.988
Oh, Peter, that was amazing!

21:20.072 --> 21:21.823
You were so brave!

21:21.907 --> 21:23.450
Nice going, Dad!

21:23.534 --> 21:25.827
Oh, boy, that was lucky
about the car, huh?

21:25.911 --> 21:27.663
Take that, you bastard!

21:27.746 --> 21:30.123
Nobody makes a fool
out of Mort Goldman!

21:30.207 --> 21:32.751
Spectacular
performance, maggot!

21:32.835 --> 21:34.753
How would you like
to come on the road with us

21:34.837 --> 21:35.879
as our lead jouster?

21:35.963 --> 21:37.589
Thanks, but no thanks, Coach.

21:37.673 --> 21:38.966
I've lived my dream.

21:39.049 --> 21:42.177
And besides,
my life is here with my family.

21:42.261 --> 21:43.971
But, Mom, what's Dad going
to do for a job?

21:44.054 --> 21:45.389
LOIS:
Oh, it'll be okay, Chris.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.182
Remember that episode
of The Honeymooners

21:47.266 --> 21:48.684
when Ralph lost his job

21:48.767 --> 21:50.894
but at the end of the show
he didn't get it back?

21:50.978 --> 21:52.813
PETER: Yeah, what was
up with that?

21:52.896 --> 21:54.773
That bugged
the crap out of me.
