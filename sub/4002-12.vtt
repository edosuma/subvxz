50:09.333 --> 50:10.959
WHO I AM.

50:10.959 --> 50:13.041
QUESTION IS,
WHAT DO I BECOME?

50:13.041 --> 50:16.041
THERE ARE SO MANY BLANKS
LEFT TO FILL IN.

50:16.041 --> 50:19.917
BUT RIGHT NOW, AT THIS MOMENT,
I'M CONTENT.

50:19.917 --> 50:22.250
MAYBE EVEN...

50:22.250 --> 50:24.083
HAPPY.

50:24.083 --> 50:28.917
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,
WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE...

50:28.917 --> 50:32.000
LIFE IS GOOD.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
