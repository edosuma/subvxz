<i>About what happened with the wolf and the mushroom.</i>

19:55.973 --> 19:59.054
<i>Once upon a time, the weather was rough.</i>

20:01.115 --> 20:05.421
<i>The sky was full of smoke and stunk like the smell of sulphur.</i>

20:05.486 --> 20:10.676
<i>And all the animals had starved and fled.</i>

20:10.743 --> 20:14.091
<i>The wolf was all alone.</i>

20:14.157 --> 20:18.847
<i>Sick and alone.</i>

20:21.406 --> 20:24.295
<i>He leaves and goes to the forest.</i>

20:25.590 --> 20:29.588
<i>As he's walking around, he sees a tree.</i>

20:33.796 --> 20:36.609
<i>He begins to hallucinate.</i>

20:37.939 --> 20:43.897
<i>Mi'gmaq children are hanging from the tree.</i>

20:43.925 --> 20:47.616
<i>The wolf, so hungry, blacks-out</i>

20:49.254 --> 20:51.799
<i>and shakes the tree really hard.</i>

20:51.864 --> 20:56.824
<i>Until the children begin to fall.</i>

20:56.851 --> 21:01.696
<i>He sees them as though their heads have become</i>

21:01.953 --> 21:08.676
<i>mushroom caps and their bones as stalks.</i>

21:10.929 --> 21:13.818
<i>He begins to eat, and eat.</i>

21:14.996 --> 21:18.689
<i>Until finally, he's eaten all the children.</i>

21:18.755 --> 21:21.566
<i>When he comes back to reality,</i>

21:22.668 --> 21:24.482
<i>he looks around at the woeld.</i>

21:24.509 --> 21:27.398
<i>He feels so sorry for what he has done.</i>

21:28.461 --> 21:33.341
<i>Not knowing what to do, he continues to eat.</i>

21:33.368 --> 21:36.909
<i>As he sits there, he begins to eat his tail,</i>

21:36.976 --> 21:41.781
<i>he gets to his stomach, and begins to eat his stomach.</i>

21:43.727 --> 21:48.610
<i>He finishes his stomach,</i>

21:48.676 --> 21:52.100
<i>then gets to his heart and eats his heart.</i>

21:52.166 --> 21:54.248
<i>He has inished his heart completely,</i>

21:54.315 --> 21:56.781
<i>and then has finished eating himself.</i>

22:03.444 --> 22:05.910
<i>Where did you hear that story?</i>

22:10.618 --> 22:15.960
<i>Before they took me off to school, my mother told it to me.</i>

22:21.089 --> 22:23.133
<i>Your mother is telling it to you too.</i>

22:28.916 --> 22:31.418
<i>I'm going to steal back that money.</i>

22:33.633 --> 22:39.322
For you, new boys,
the rules are simple.

22:39.388 --> 22:44.730
You get caught out of your beds,
you catch a beating, you mend in isolation

22:44.796 --> 22:47.647
You get caught talking to eatch other,
you get beat.

22:47.712 --> 22:52.440
You get caught coughing,
crying, sneezing, pissing,

22:52.507 --> 22:54.741
Breathing too fucking loud,

22:56.380 --> 22:59.191
You get beat
and put in isolation.

23:01.558 --> 23:07.171
Now, habitually fuck with these rules

23:09.039 --> 23:10.929

it's the queen fucking english.

23:21.430 --> 23:22.628
Relish it.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.800
I think everybody will be
too wasted to recognize you, Juj.

23:45.749 --> 23:47.372
Should be good for the night.

23:53.460 --> 23:57.115
And you are sure this will

23:57.180 --> 23:59.609

Let me worry about that.

24:07.921 --> 24:09.350
Time to get ready.

24:15.325 --> 24:18.522

24:25.951 --> 24:29.682

24:34.465 --> 24:37.201
Hey, I asked you not

24:41.371 --> 24:43.876
All you wanna do is cut this
fucking asshole slack.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.867
When I told you you should
have (?)eliminado a long time ago.

24:47.815 --> 24:48.977
Who's to say he

24:49.004 --> 24:51.700
Didn't steal the fucking money
or smoke all the fucking the dope?

24:51.767 --> 24:55.921
He wouldn't do something like that.
Now how much of this you wanna do?

24:55.948 --> 24:58.644
Oh fuck.

25:03.236 --> 25:07.390

26:31.616 --> 26:33.738
All right, but don't you worry

26:33.765 --> 26:37.114
Now we will celebrate your return
to the Crow Kingdom.

26:37.180 --> 26:42.023
With song, dance, booze, dope.
The gods shine down on us tonight.

26:42.050 --> 26:44.901
Maybe a sacrificial virgin or two.

26:48.534 --> 26:50.195
See you later boys.

26:52.792 --> 26:54.759
That car is scary.

27:01.154 --> 27:02.969
It's because it eats little kid.

27:05.413 --> 27:08.759
<i>If you are good at one thing,
apply it to everything.</i>

27:11.126 --> 27:14.169
<i>You can turn anything
into an art form.</i>

27:16.383 --> 27:18.350
<i>I have been doing this for years.</i>

27:21.179 --> 27:24.334
<i>You have whiskey, wine, cognac
tip cigar (?)blends.</i>

27:25.282 --> 27:28.324
<i>For of us princes and princesses
that wouldn't lower themself to smoke.</i>

27:28.351 --> 27:32.122
<i>On the (?)thought of doing some thing
that no one else can afford.</i>

27:36.292 --> 27:38.682
Well,
what do you want, fool?

27:39.936 --> 27:41.634
Zombi.

27:45.806 --> 27:49.039
<i>You have honey dip (?)blends
for the drum and feather Indians</i>

27:49.105 --> 27:51.031
<i>That like to keep it all natural.</i>

27:51.098 --> 27:55.175
<i>To smoke down close to the root spiriter
Whatever.</i>

27:59.729 --> 28:02.156
<i>And then you have
Broken (?)resurex</i>

28:02.183 --> 28:05.915
<i>Want nothing more to get fucked-up
for bottom dollar.</i>

28:05.982 --> 28:11.516
<i>This, is what (?)bond my people together,
the art of forgetfulness.</i>

28:16.033 --> 28:17.999
Batter up.

28:34.099 --> 28:37.986
- What?
- I said this is Tiffany.

28:40.006 --> 28:42.089
No, it's Tammy.

28:42.116 --> 28:44.852
Get the fuck off.
Fuck.

28:52.895 --> 28:55.976
- Still like woman, right?
- Fuck off, Burner.

28:57.615 --> 28:59.737
I don't know.
Just got out of prison.

29:03.483 --> 29:05.566
Where did she learn how to do all that?

29:09.124 --> 29:12.509
You were supposed to take care of her,
Burner, not her take care of you.

29:12.574 --> 29:14.157
You even know your daughter, man?

29:16.103 --> 29:17.610
Eh, Joe?

29:18.559 --> 29:23.402
She is a coupling of Anna, Ceres
and your fucking hard head.

29:23.468 --> 29:26.281
She gonna eat people
after the apocalypse.

29:27.995 --> 29:29.962
What make you think
any of this was my idee?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.420
What I think is little girls

29:31.486 --> 29:34.603
Should be slinging dops to a bush
of fucking red tarsh Indians.

29:34.669 --> 29:37.865
Little girl?
You been gone a long time, Joe.

29:37.893 --> 29:40.435
That ain't no little girl no more.

29:41.921 --> 29:46.151
- Fucking asshole.
- Hey man, I didn't mean...

29:48.710 --> 29:50.179
Fuck.

30:04.704 --> 30:06.021
What's the count?

30:09.425 --> 30:10.661
Fucking bingo money.

30:12.761 --> 30:15.955
Aila, why won't you call it a night
go hang with your dad?

30:16.021 --> 30:18.910
- I'll (?)wrap it up for the night.
- You can't roll for shit.

30:24.805 --> 30:26.735
I don't thing these guys are gonna notice.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.336
Move it, shitbird.

31:39.453 --> 31:41.344
Now I'm home!

32:07.571 --> 32:08.849
Mom?

32:31.546 --> 32:33.169
Aila.

32:40.369 --> 32:43.757
<i>Vengeance.</i>

33:11.288 --> 03:14.482
Come one(?), get up.
Fuck off.

33:15.698 --> 33:18.741
Get up, man.
Get the fuck off my porch.

33:22.259 --> 33:24.495
Hey, get up.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.100
Come one, man, let's go.
Get the fuck off.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.704
Morning, dad.

33:37.027 --> 33:39.608
They have to stay here, man
Sleep it off.

33:39.636 --> 33:41.372
Ho yeah.
All of them?

33:48.995 --> 33:50.235
This fucking tast like weed.

33:55.363 --> 33:59.977
- How long you guys been doing this?
- About seven years.

34:00.043 --> 34:01.895
Hey, Aila.

34:01.961 --> 34:05.348
Ho yeah? This fucking
hillbilery stop today.

34:05.414 --> 34:09.719
You know big brother, I appreciate
You coming on the white horse,

34:09.746 --> 34:12.748
But the fucking thing is
this shit here, it's intricate.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.896
You can't just go around pulling on thread
with your good intentions

34:15.922 --> 34:17.469
especting shit
to work itself out.

34:17.534 --> 34:20.884
We need that money
To re-up from the old witch.

34:20.911 --> 34:22.802
Don't call her that.

34:22.829 --> 34:25.793
The old lady, Ceres,
whatever.

34:25.859 --> 34:28.746
All right.
So who does the pick up?

34:30.271 --> 34:31.547
Aila does them.

34:32.496 --> 34:35.231
One the off chance a (?)tony cop roll through
She is underage

34:35.295 --> 34:37.570
And they can't do anything to her
For taking(?) that much dope.

34:37.636 --> 34:40.141
And they find me here
At the garage.

34:41.242 --> 34:43.937
jesus left in fucking crist.

34:44.004 --> 34:46.009
Looks at your face.
Looks at her face.

34:46.036 --> 34:48.733
A dick drug fox pop
stumbling around.

34:48.799 --> 34:51.838
- My name is Tammy.
- Shut the fuck up.

34:52.864 --> 34:54.446
You guys are asshole.

34:55.741 --> 35:00.202
Fucking bunch of stupid hangover indians
laying all over the place.

35:01.687 --> 35:05.803
- I'm taking over on the runs.
- Fuck, Joseph. Did you not just hear me?

35:05.868 --> 35:08.373
You've got paper on you too.
Your name still ring out.

35:08.629 --> 35:10.789
You don't thing that Tony
know that you are here?

35:10.855 --> 35:13.590
Damn, didn't they teach you
anything in prison?

35:13.617 --> 35:15.929
This ain't the life
I wanted for you, Aila.

35:21.403 --> 35:24.560
Better(?) get himself in order
before bringing this shit down, Aila...

35:24.587 --> 35:27.859
- Popper is already looking at him.
- Take it easy.

35:27.886 --> 35:31.926
I can do a dry run with him today,
Just let him know what it is we do.

35:33.680 --> 35:36.681
Yeah.
I know my brother.

35:40.315 --> 35:43.357
<i>My father is not what anyone
would call a good man.</i>

35:43.423 --> 35:46.195
<i>More like a man who did
good thing for wrong reasons</i>

35:46.222 --> 35:48.572
<i>And wrong thing for good reasons.</i>

35:48.638 --> 35:51.067
<i>Joseph like to fight.</i>

35:53.128 --> 35:56.744
<i>The history goes that my father
pity the white boy and intervened.</i>

35:56.810 --> 36:01.080
<i>But the truth, really
He just wanted to (?)recon this brawling.</i>

36:24.967 --> 36:27.662
<i>My father offered
his hand to Popper.</i>

36:28.686 --> 36:31.191
<i>But there was already
hate in the boy heart.</i>

36:31.258 --> 36:32.840
<i>He gave my father up to the priest</i>

36:32.906 --> 36:35.065
<i>As with of the rest of the boys that beat him.</i>

36:36.128 --> 36:39.094
Would you please teach it to Joseph here?

36:39.159 --> 36:43.237
<i>And in showing such diligence
begin his asshole training in earnest.</i>

36:44.644 --> 36:46.613
Vespers is the evening prayer.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.832
<i>And it when on like this.</i>

37:11.191 --> 37:12.926
This place changed.

37:14.412 --> 37:16.072
Same shit, different pile.

37:20.434 --> 37:23.284
Do you want to come with me, dad?
Come to see what I do?

37:23.350 --> 37:26.966
I'm gonna go see the old man.
See if I can get down on the water.

37:27.494 --> 37:29.843
You are not allowed
on the water this time of year.

37:29.909 --> 37:34.254
- It's why there are no boats.
- There are no fish in the water anyway.

37:34.282 --> 37:36.979
What, you are not allowed to fish
with no fish in the water?

37:37.045 --> 37:38.513
It's not allowed.

37:39.883 --> 37:43.920
Heay well, I'm going to see
the old man anyways.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.529
I'm gonna get my boat back,
one way or another.

37:46.595 --> 37:50.903
- Dad. Dad!
- What, Aila?

37:50.968 --> 37:52.553
It's the other way.

38:02.553 --> 38:04.982
Think the joint might have broke that man.

38:06.467 --> 38:10.350
You know, after they found Tyler dead and
my mother killed herself,

38:11.337 --> 38:13.995
He called the police
to come and get him.

38:14.062 --> 38:16.528
Said:
"I just killed a boy".

38:16.555 --> 38:20.747
- Yeah, that was a accident, that was...
- The jail didn't break him.

38:21.811 --> 38:23.047
<i>We did.</i>

38:59.020 --> 39:01.063
Fuck you were doing,
shaving your legs?

39:01.090 --> 39:02.522
Fucking hell, Aila.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.471
Sure, come on in.

39:39.604 --> 39:42.376
So we are gonna break into
saint D's and rob Popper.

39:42.442 --> 39:44.909
What?
Say what now?

39:45.127 --> 39:49.511
We are gonna break into
saint D's and rob Popper.

39:49.539 --> 39:51.851
Oh man.

39:53.374 --> 39:56.146
You wanna go into that fucking place?
Fuck that.

39:57.019 --> 39:59.715
I don't get a shit
if I don't do my re-up.

39:59.742 --> 40:02.094
Aila, if I get caught
going in there,

40:02.160 --> 40:06.773
Those fucking (?)religiosos there
are gonna fucking take turn Superman in me.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.769
I don't even know what that means.

40:08.796 --> 40:11.300
It's when you come up someone's back
and stick a piece off...

40:11.327 --> 40:12.989
Fuck up, man.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.514
And what make you think that
Popper ain't gonna do this anyway?

40:17.733 --> 40:21.811
Fuck it, man. I'm too hangover
to be doing all this thinking.

40:23.756 --> 40:25.609
Me and Jujijj droped
late last night.

40:25.635 --> 40:27.910
We were going over how
he gets out of there

40:27.976 --> 40:31.593
Without anybody seen him
or knowing he's gone.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.545
I drew this.

40:38.370 --> 40:41.757
They know he's gone.
Ain't gonna trust a kid.

40:41.785 --> 40:45.861
- A little kid?
- Yeah, a little kid.

40:45.927 --> 40:48.124
What is this shit, Aila?

40:49.572 --> 40:50.427
We draw a map.

40:51.490 --> 40:55.682
Jujijj said that Popper and his (?)sturdy
go through the same routine every night.

40:55.709 --> 41:00.017
They do the rounds, they do a head count,
they get their grope on.

41:00.082 --> 41:02.895
Then Popper hit the bathroom
to wash off his shame.

41:02.960 --> 41:06.001
The bathroom is right next to his office.

41:06.067 --> 41:09.684
If he catches us, we are fucking doomed.

41:09.749 --> 41:13.634
So when he is out of his office,
we are gonna need to keep him out.

41:15.962 --> 41:19.809
- This is totaly fucking retarded.
- I'm in.

41:19.837 --> 41:21.767
It's the last day of the month.

41:22.715 --> 41:25.526
We gotta take from his collection too.

41:28.314 --> 41:30.819
I think we gonna need more help.

41:36.600 --> 41:38.530
All you want to do is take this guy's money?

41:38.557 --> 41:41.291
Our money.

41:41.358 --> 41:44.169
So much shit I want to do to that fucking OP.

41:50.372 --> 41:52.033
So why stop at robing him?

41:52.060 --> 41:56.712
All I saying is if we are going to the trouble,
then at least fuck this man up.

41:56.777 --> 41:58.208
Yeah.

42:35.216 --> 42:36.605
He miss me.

42:41.275 --> 42:42.782
We all miss you.

42:46.032 --> 42:48.114
You don't come see me no more.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.640
I don't need to come here to see you.

42:54.202 --> 42:55.557
You are everwh...

42:56.889 --> 42:58.510
Who are you talking to?

43:00.187 --> 43:01.272
Nobody.

43:05.787 --> 43:08.254
What do you think he is doing down there?

43:09.776 --> 43:11.706
Looking for mom's grave.

43:12.807 --> 43:14.814
he's gonna be wandering for a while.

43:17.911 --> 43:21.180
- Wanna me go get him?
- No.

43:22.358 --> 43:23.483
I'll get him.

43:43.189 --> 43:43.813
Dad?

44:01.714 --> 44:03.759
I ain't never see a grave before.

44:05.436 --> 44:07.902
I just wanted to come down here to look at it.

44:10.195 --> 44:13.081
It's just a bunch of cross with no names.

44:21.318 --> 44:23.784
They don't mark the grave of suicides.

44:26.688 --> 44:29.691
<i>I dreamt her walking down the beach,</i>

44:31.406 --> 44:33.374
<i>she was a rotting dead person.</i>

44:33.440 --> 44:35.446
Just walking.

45:00.176 --> 45:05.060
<i>Because they buried her without a name, she walks around.</i>

45:06.698 --> 45:09.011
It's why she still walk around.

45:21.121 --> 45:23.356
<i>Why would they bury her?</i>

45:23.423 --> 45:26.538
Where she can still fucking walk around?

45:29.329 --> 45:30.951
<i>Why would they bury her?</i>

45:35.851 --> 45:37.895
Dad?

45:39.572 --> 45:40.502
Dad.

45:41.873 --> 45:44.225
Dad.
Stop.

46:46.203 --> 46:48.056
It's almost done now, Tyler.

47:41.632 --> 47:42.756
Out of milk.

47:45.278 --> 47:47.206
Made you sandwich.

47:48.230 --> 47:51.118
- Where is dad?
- He went out.

47:51.145 --> 47:54.034
Said he gonna steal himself a boat.

47:54.061 --> 47:56.758
What?
And you didn't stop him?

47:57.897 --> 47:59.250
Why would I?

47:59.509 --> 48:02.089
He's been a pain in the fucking ass
since he got out.

48:02.116 --> 48:05.005
Figured he got himself busted,
throw back in the clink,

48:05.224 --> 48:07.229
killing all kind of birds.

48:07.296 --> 48:11.680
And no Popper up on our ass.
No more jiminy the cricket fucking speeches.

48:13.126 --> 48:15.207
Popper's goons already got
Jujijj last night.

48:19.109 --> 48:20.118
Enter.

48:23.561 --> 48:24.184
Hey.

48:26.437 --> 48:27.983
You need to come get your dad.

48:40.439 --> 48:44.399
<i>Because no one knew his age,
the kingdom only refer to him as the old man.</i>

48:44.619 --> 48:47.661
<i>He had lied to fight in world war two.</i>

48:47.688 --> 48:50.997
<i>Left a teenager and
come back a thousand years old.</i>

48:51.908 --> 48:54.221
<i>Not even the dogs recognized him.</i>

48:56.702 --> 49:00.164
I ever tell you your grandfather
saved my life during the war?

49:02.034 --> 49:05.191
Yeah.
In a place called Tarawa.

49:05.218 --> 49:08.645
First time we went up again
them Japanese boys.

49:08.710 --> 49:10.101
What happen?

49:11.048 --> 49:15.663
Your grandfather used to be fishman
before he left to put up steel.

49:15.690 --> 49:17.351
He used to know the tides.

49:17.379 --> 49:20.841
He told them those Higgins boats
wouldn't clear the reefs that time of year.

49:21.060 --> 49:22.723
there's going to be a dog tide.

49:23.631 --> 49:26.556
Even trough we drop bomb for
all of two days on that island,

49:26.622 --> 49:30.242
Those japaneses boys still came on to us.
Light us up

49:30.307 --> 49:33.193
Burn down every boat
we had on that water.

49:38.017 --> 49:40.060
So how did granpa save you?

49:41.621 --> 49:47.119
Soon as the Higgins hit the sand,
Your grandpa just started pulling man out.

49:49.026 --> 49:55.212
Some of us just kept moving,
dead piling up out on our feet.

50:24.046 --> 50:26.553
Why did you tell me that story
about my grandfather?

50:26.618 --> 50:32.153
Sometimes courage, Aila, it's mean
grinding your teeth and moving forward,

50:32.219 --> 50:34.416
not paying attention to the consequences.

50:49.519 --> 50:50.412
Hey.

50:53.699 --> 50:55.589
Come here, I'm gonna help you.

51:08.199 --> 51:12.698
Your mother loved it out here.
It was her favorite place to be.

51:15.336 --> 51:16.765
So peaceful.

51:22.392 --> 51:24.130
No fish in the water.

51:42.303 --> 51:43.848
It's been a long time, Joseph.

51:51.355 --> 51:56.582
You know, ever since you arrived
in my fair hamlet, we had ruckus partys,

51:56.648 --> 52:02.951
drunk indians, a car blow up,
a grave desecrated.

52:03.017 --> 52:07.246
Now we find you out here on the water
were you are not supposed to be.

52:07.311 --> 52:09.472
Aila, go on up to the house,
I will be right there.

52:09.499 --> 52:11.083
I'm not going anywhere.

52:12.952 --> 52:16.223
The law of the land decrees
that I take you back into custody.

52:16.251 --> 52:19.024
That your ass back in jail.

52:19.089 --> 52:21.632
You must enjoy the company of men.

52:21.659 --> 52:23.166
You hear the man?

52:23.194 --> 52:26.120
See, he says you like
to get fucked in your ass.

52:26.377 --> 52:30.606
<i>Rule number four, don't act like
a badass if you can't fight.</i>

52:31.746 --> 52:36.438
<i>Someone (?)curse you and you don't showdown,
people will look at you as pussy.</i>

52:39.419 --> 52:42.768
<i>This apply to every animal
in the Kingdom of the Crow.</i>

52:42.834 --> 52:45.299
<i>Ain't nobody above an ass kicking.</i>

52:45.557 --> 52:46.528
come on.

52:49.623 --> 52:51.053
Watch this, sweetheart.

52:59.136 --> 53:00.643
All right, enough.

53:17.317 --> 53:19.362
Almost feel bad about this.

53:20.772 --> 53:23.468
Fucking indians,
bring out the worst in me.

53:25.451 --> 53:26.536
You see?

53:53.108 --> 53:54.078
Aila.

53:55.986 --> 53:59.563
Not only did Burner tell us
you where down here,

53:59.628 --> 54:04.320
not only did he tell us about
your little helper and where he was at last night,

54:05.958 --> 54:09.691
but he let us in on your little plan to
break into the school.

54:12.979 --> 54:16.213
Congratulations,
you are in.

54:18.849 --> 54:21.543
You are getting fitted for Dymphna's grace.

54:23.451 --> 54:26.646
And put down into the darkest
deepest hole we got.

54:50.379 --> 54:52.614
Do you know what we do

54:52.681 --> 54:57.143
with all the priest little
miss (?)forgotten children here?

54:58.091 --> 55:00.672
They are tossed in the fire and burn.

55:00.929 --> 55:04.852
We thought Aila was doomed.
Another transgression set for the flames.

55:05.839 --> 55:09.264
Then you step up
and took responsibility.

55:11.785 --> 55:15.325
Here we are, all of us, damned.

55:50.222 --> 55:53.913
I want you to read something with me,
Joseph.

55:55.055 --> 55:57.176
For old times sake.

55:57.203 --> 56:02.354
This passage kept me warm for the past seven years.

56:04.873 --> 56:08.530
"Vengeance and retribution are mine.

56:08.558 --> 56:14.858
In due time my enemy foot will slip,
for the day of their calamity is near,

56:14.925 --> 56:20.805
And the impending sorrows and ruined nation
are falling fast upon them".

58:28.263 --> 58:29.617
Sorry it took so long, boss.

58:29.682 --> 58:32.610
<i>I wonder how many ghost wander
around down in this hole.</i>

58:36.089 --> 58:38.094
<i>And the devil doesn't let them go.</i>

58:45.027 --> 58:47.914
<i>Or how many got out that 
where ruined all the same.</i>

58:52.391 --> 58:55.203
It's better be enough because
it's all the one we could find.

58:55.269 --> 58:57.735
- It will be enough.
- If it work at all.

58:57.800 --> 58:59.921
That's the thought that count, I think.

59:00.983 --> 59:02.145
Just put it in the van.

59:04.244 --> 59:05.905
Did you bring all your gear?

59:10.880 --> 59:12.772
Last but not least.

59:12.838 --> 59:15.879
It's funny how many people
willing to donate to the cause.

59:15.907 --> 59:17.836
It's like passing a beer (?)head around.

59:46.593 --> 59:49.520
- You guys want to smoke a joint first?
- yes.

01:00:21.577 --> 01:00:22.778
Let's suit up.

01:00:36.539 --> 01:00:39.388
- What are you supposed to be?
- An old lady.

01:00:39.454 --> 01:00:43.185
- That's kind of lame.
- Your fucking face is lame.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.218
Nice to have you back, Aila.

01:00:45.284 --> 01:00:46.755
Where is your costume?

01:00:47.932 --> 01:00:49.093
I'm a rabbit.

01:00:50.578 --> 01:00:53.811
Hey,
Are we doing this or what?

01:00:53.878 --> 01:00:55.690
(?)We are going to amuse.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:10.152
We need to find the utility room.

01:01:14.822 --> 01:01:15.752
Come on.

01:01:39.486 --> 01:01:40.802
Fuck, it's locked.

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:48.127
(?)Leave me to take the gloves out of my ass.

01:01:54.754 --> 01:01:55.954
I've got the shit.

01:02:05.493 --> 01:02:07.847
This is so fucking crazy.

01:02:08.832 --> 01:02:10.722
Can you guys shut the fuck up?

01:02:11.709 --> 01:02:13.447
I talk when I'm nervous.

01:02:14.203 --> 01:02:16.477
We need to get upstairs.
How long is this gonna take?

01:02:16.735 --> 01:02:21.041
Fifteen minutes.
To pour in the rest of this shit
and pressurize it.

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:25.604
In order for that shit to go
into the first faucet that he opens.

01:02:48.957 --> 01:02:53.418
Milch is just beating on my dad.
I don't know where the other one are.

01:02:53.483 --> 01:02:55.222
Should make this easy, then.

01:02:56.283 --> 01:02:59.171
All right.
Let's do this.

01:03:03.456 --> 01:03:05.923
Trick or treat, cocksucker.

01:03:07.292 --> 01:03:09.221
What the fuck?

01:03:09.287 --> 01:03:12.904
I'm gonna nail you,
cunt little brad, to your beds.

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.667
Not to night, you ain't.

01:03:20.679 --> 01:03:23.108
Enough.
Give me the keys.

01:03:27.278 --> 01:03:28.745
Come on.

01:03:36.716 --> 01:03:39.910
Get him to Maytag's house.
We are gonna take care of it from here and on.

01:03:42.584 --> 01:03:43.744
What is going on?

01:03:50.025 --> 01:03:53.258
They cut the braids
on your bottom half too?

01:03:54.207 --> 01:03:56.059
Lights out, motherfucker.

01:04:09.972 --> 01:04:11.172
Lock it behind us.

01:04:16.723 --> 01:04:17.464
Come on.

01:04:23.476 --> 01:04:25.404
- It's fucking locked.
- Well, crack it.

01:04:25.431 --> 01:04:29.469
I can't open this. If we were
to my place then maybe I could open it.

01:04:31.415 --> 01:04:33.114
Hide.
Hide. Hide.

01:05:16.757 --> 01:05:18.840
Fuck this.
He's gone.

01:05:24.274 --> 01:05:26.396
He fucking locked it.
He locked the safe.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:29.312
Who give a shit?
We gotta get the fuck out of here.

01:05:29.339 --> 01:05:33.838
No way. You gonna grab your balls
and we are gonna finish this. Come on.

01:06:41.839 --> 01:06:44.189
- Which on is it?
- The old one.

01:06:44.216 --> 01:06:45.838
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

01:06:48.398 --> 01:06:50.980
Fucking horror show.
He's gonna know it was us.

01:06:51.045 --> 01:06:52.630
He's gonna know it was us anyways.

01:06:58.603 --> 01:07:01.029
I'll kill you!

01:07:10.686 --> 01:07:11.770
Where is my dad?

01:07:13.409 --> 01:07:17.333
He didn't want to come here.
Said to bring him home.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:18.713
Left him at Burner's.

01:07:20.121 --> 01:07:21.207
Left him at Burner's?

01:07:21.272 --> 01:07:23.355
He said he wanted to keep a eye on Jujijj.

01:07:23.421 --> 01:07:25.158
And I ain't arguing with your dad, Aila.

01:07:25.224 --> 01:07:27.076
Beat up or not.

01:07:27.141 --> 01:07:29.300
Anybody fucking count this yet?

01:07:31.168 --> 01:07:34.825
- I don't think I can count that high.
- Almost twenty grand.

01:07:34.889 --> 01:07:37.624
The fuck are we gonna do
with twenty grand?

01:07:38.573 --> 01:07:39.965
We all need to run away.

01:07:41.488 --> 01:07:45.219
I need to pay back the old lady.
Let's split it up.

01:07:45.285 --> 01:07:48.865
They are gonna know it was us.
And they are gonna come for us.

01:07:48.929 --> 01:07:52.125
You need to run.
Run.

01:08:18.122 --> 01:08:19.321
<i>Grandma?</i>

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:57.441
He is not gonna make it
to fun not with that (?) on.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.155
Suppose he isn't.

01:11:06.022 --> 01:11:06.993
Come here.

01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:10.025
I want you to help me do the rest of it.

01:11:12.389 --> 01:11:15.469
Star part is finish.
I want you to do the hard part.

01:11:15.498 --> 01:11:18.384
I though you said the Mi'gmaq
didn't wear the headdress?

01:11:18.450 --> 01:11:20.265
They don't.

01:11:20.292 --> 01:11:23.027
Then why are you make me put one on yet?

01:11:23.093 --> 01:11:27.820
- I don't think this kinds (?)worked on.
- Yeah, I didn't.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:33.959
Keep a eye on what you are doing.
Then use the brush for the detail works.

01:11:36.863 --> 01:11:38.678
Ok then,
how did he get one?

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:45.582
Because, I don't know,
there are some people who think it look powerful.

01:11:45.647 --> 01:11:50.032
- Why do they think that?
- Because they're dumbass.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.950
Dumbass.

01:11:55.736 --> 01:12:00.428
No, that's not how I teach you to do lines.
You are better than that.

01:12:10.504 --> 01:12:14.428
Why are we doing all the detail
work in the dark anyway?

01:12:14.494 --> 01:12:21.064
Well, drawing of an Indian on some
piece of wood isn't that big of a deal.

01:12:21.131 --> 01:12:23.826
Two Indians drawing an Indian yes,

01:12:23.892 --> 01:12:28.468
For some people that's scary
and we can get in trouble for it.

01:12:28.534 --> 01:12:31.347
Then why do we keep doing it?

01:12:31.412 --> 01:12:35.948
Christ, Aila, I never meet a person
who ask so many question about everything.

01:12:38.239 --> 01:12:42.700
If you must know,
it's because it's important to your dad.

01:12:42.766 --> 01:12:46.152
- Why is it important to him?
- I don't know.

01:12:48.789 --> 01:12:49.913
Ask him.

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.213
What are you doing, Aila?

01:13:09.617 --> 01:13:10.855
Final rule.

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:15.343
Don't show weakness
or let your emotional barrier down.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.139
What are you talking about?

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.206
It's all my fault.

01:13:28.798 --> 01:13:29.921
All of it.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:36.479
- Ceres, you...
- Jesus, Aila.

01:13:39.613 --> 01:13:41.160
All you just needed to do is ask

01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:43.653
I would have done anything
you needed me to.

01:13:44.717 --> 01:13:46.530
I didn't needed you, dad.

01:13:47.632 --> 01:13:49.828
Just not the way either of us wanted.

01:13:57.567 --> 01:14:02.717
I don't know if you know this but,
you're just a little girl.

01:14:04.395 --> 01:14:06.363
I was never a little girl, dad.

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:12.002
It doesn't matter. We are the one
that is supposed to take care of you.

01:14:14.178 --> 01:14:18.060
Your mother was broken way before what happened
and it had nothing to do with you.

01:14:18.126 --> 01:14:19.059
- That was on...
- Dad!

01:14:24.956 --> 01:14:28.650
It felt good,
what we did to Ceres.

01:14:30.556 --> 01:14:35.439
Sholo, he sold you out
by the third tooth.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.796
You want to run? Go ahead.
Leave me here with him. Run.

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:52.548
Come closer.

01:14:53.726 --> 01:14:55.234
Closer!

01:15:06.652 --> 01:15:07.355
It's ok.

01:15:34.082 --> 01:15:39.041
Now, normally
I wouldn't do this,

01:15:39.259 --> 01:15:44.103
but you left such a impression

01:15:44.168 --> 01:15:48.514
that I gonna make a exception,
just for you.

01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:00.790
Now,
you put that gun down or I'm gonna...

01:16:38.103 --> 01:16:40.454
May not see him for a while.

01:16:40.711 --> 01:16:44.136
Took the fall for the drug op
and the dead OP.

01:16:58.932 --> 01:17:03.048
Come on, Joe, Let's call it a day.
Come on.

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.810
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:17:46.576 --> 01:17:51.956
We caught Milch out at Ceres's place,
trying to clean out the greenhouse.

01:17:54.093 --> 01:17:58.019
- You know anything about that?
- No.

01:18:00.077 --> 01:18:02.774
I'm not gonna let you continue
to run that drug op.

01:18:04.756 --> 01:18:05.728
Good.

01:18:11.165 --> 01:18:15.011
Ho, yeh.
Someone here that want to see you.

01:18:38.476 --> 01:18:39.369
You coming?

01:18:50.444 --> 01:18:52.259
What do we do now, boss?
