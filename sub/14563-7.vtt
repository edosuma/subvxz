WEBVTT

00:31.573 --> 00:34.243
Guys, I think we could use
another phone jack over here.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.121
Cabracadabra.
We wanna reach out and grab you.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.749
-No, we're a cab company.
-Can you toss me the thing?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.795
- Sorry. The other thing.
- Okay. Watch the couch.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.923
Hey. Goddammit!

00:48.006 --> 00:49.841
I apologize for... I understand.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.802
Mind if I put you on hold one second?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.845
Don't put me on hold.
Do you know who I am?

00:53.929 --> 00:56.473
I just won a Baby's Choice Award,
the winner of which

00:56.557 --> 00:59.685
has gone to take home the Oscar
seven of the last 15 years.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.187
So, yeah, <i>that </i>BoJack Horseman.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.856
Otherwise known as the guy you keep
sending your dumb newspaper to

01:04.940 --> 01:06.525
even though I never subscribed to it.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.068
I'm putting you on hold.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.078
-We have a situation, sir.
-Talk to me.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.789
Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.
He's pretty steamed.

01:20.872 --> 01:24.126
I've tried everything, but we might need
to bring the Closer in on this one.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.504
Calm down. We can sort this out
without having to get the Closer involved.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.299
Did you offer 26 weeks
at 50 percent off the newsstand price?

01:30.382 --> 01:33.635
I went through the entire checklist, sir.
Even offered him a free tote bag.

01:33.719 --> 01:37.055
What kind of monster says no
to a tote bag? Good work, rep.

01:37.139 --> 01:40.559
You've done all that could be
expected of you. I'll take it from here.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.689
Yeah, Got it. Right.
I understand. I'll take it from here.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.649
God help us...

01:47.733 --> 01:51.194
Is what I'd say if we needed God's help.
Fortunately, we got one better.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.031
Morning. Good morning.
How was your weekend? How are you?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.658
Good work yesterday.
Get out of my way, please.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.914
We have a situation on line two.
Name's Horseman. BoJack Horseman.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.625
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

02:06.376 --> 02:10.005
Hello, good morning, and I say this
with 100 percent sincerity...

02:10.088 --> 02:12.549
<i>How can I help you?</i>

02:14.343 --> 02:21.016
<i>♪♪</i>

03:07.062 --> 03:10.649
I never subscribed to the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>
I do not read the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

03:10.732 --> 03:14.111
I have called this number so many times
to stop sending it to me.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.531
Yet every morning, I open my door
on a new edition of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

03:17.614 --> 03:20.075
It's like I'm in a boring episode
of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

03:20.158 --> 03:22.369
Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.373
But before we dig in,
is there anything I can get you?

03:26.456 --> 03:28.333
A glass of ice water perhaps?

03:28.417 --> 03:30.836
Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.

03:30.919 --> 03:35.257
Fabulous. Johnny will get that to you
in three, two, one...

03:35.340 --> 03:38.760
Uh... huh.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.139
I see you've been receiving
our paper for six months,

03:42.222 --> 03:46.184
but there's no record of you
ever registering a complaint.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.687
From whence the hostility, counselor?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.773
It wasn't a problem until recently,
because up until a week ago

03:51.857 --> 03:55.193
the boy who lives with me used the paper
to make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.738
-What was that?
-I live with my best friend, Todd.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.157
Good kid, but sometimes
he gets ideas to do things.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.247
-Pretty scary, right?
-Yes. What the hell is that?

04:07.330 --> 04:08.749
Giant Todd Head, of course.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.126
I've been working on him
for the last six months.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.169
What? Why?

04:12.252 --> 04:15.213
It all started
when a rustling from the kitchen

04:15.297 --> 04:17.799
jostled me from tender slumber.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.262
Uh...

04:25.432 --> 04:26.391
What was that?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.399
If there's a ghost present,
please do not scream

04:34.483 --> 04:39.070
or have a skull face or be wearing
a tattered white satin gown.

04:42.157 --> 04:46.912
Someone or something is stealing our food.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.999
I made a giant papier-mâché Todd head
to scare it away. Think it'll work?

04:51.082 --> 04:54.002
If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,
would you stop eating my food?

04:54.085 --> 04:56.671
You should take this seriously.
We might have an infestation.

04:56.755 --> 05:00.634
We do have an infestation, of Todds.
Look at that, they're getting bigger.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.805
And? Did the head help to ameliorate
your pest peccadillo?

05:04.888 --> 05:08.475
No. Todd abandoned the project as soon
as he started working on Cabracadabra.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.644
<i>-What's Cabracadabra?</i>
-That's what I said.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.063
-What's Cabracadabra?
-That's what I said.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.274
-What's Cabracadabra?
-That's what we want you to say.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.736
If I didn't know any better,
you were about to pitch an idea.

05:19.820 --> 05:24.407
-We <i>are </i>about to pitch you an idea.
-I did not know better.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.994
Has this ever happened to you?
Hey, where you headed?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.956
Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.917
-We're not at the main part yet.
-I'm so sorry. Please continue.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.253
-To the opera, good sir.
-Okay.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.047
Am I watching to see if the whole thing
has happened to me?

05:39.130 --> 05:41.633
-Or looking for one specific thing?
-Kind of both.

05:41.716 --> 05:46.471
So I just keep watching until I see
something that has happened to me?

05:46.555 --> 05:48.014
-Yes.
-What if we get to the end,

05:48.098 --> 05:49.808
none of it has ever happened to me?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.477
Maybe just try to put yourself
in Emily's shoes right now.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.563
Got it. Sorry for the interruption.
Please continue.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.274
-So, is this where you live?
-Yes, it is.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.903
-Alone or are you in a relationship?
-This hardly seems appropriate.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.990
Driver, you're starting
to make me feel uncomfortable.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.575
Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?

06:08.368 --> 06:11.496
Has a creepy driver
ever given you his number

06:11.580 --> 06:15.083
or told you that you reminded him
of his dead girlfriend?

06:15.166 --> 06:18.837
Or repeated your address slowly,
like he was trying to memorize it?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.923
-No, never.
-Unfortunately, if you are a woman

06:22.007 --> 06:25.760
all those things
would happen to you every day.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.346
That's right, Todd.
According to my own research,

06:28.430 --> 06:32.142
nine out of ten men
are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.395
But what if there was a ride-share service
that could guarantee

06:35.478 --> 06:40.025
no creepy men drivers
because there are no men drivers at all?

06:40.108 --> 06:41.693
What are you saying, robot drivers?

06:41.776 --> 06:45.155
What if they become sentient
and try to murder us, or unionize?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.615
That could be a real headache.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.951
No, not murderous robots. Women.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.287
Todd, you have done it again.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.956
Actually, Emily and I
came up with it together.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.835
Todd and Emily,
you've done it again for the first time.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.339
And that's why we're setting up shop
at your house.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.007
Why does it have to be my house?

07:04.090 --> 07:06.176
There's no room
at Mr. Peanutbutter's house.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.178
It's full of spaghetti strainers.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.096
-Why?
-Who can recall?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.724
I figure the longer they're there,
the bigger the payoff.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.060
And they've been sitting there
for months now.

07:15.143 --> 07:19.064
So you can bet
the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.859
<i>So, why did you let them use your house?</i>

07:22.943 --> 07:24.611
Hey, Todd, where do you want this...?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.029
Uh...

07:26.112 --> 07:27.739
<i>- I felt guilty.</i>
<i>- About what?</i>

07:27.822 --> 07:31.201
<i>Todd had this old girlfriend.</i>
<i>I met her a couple weeks back.</i>

07:31.284 --> 07:33.745
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.086
-What are you still doing up?
-I got thirsty.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.254
Then you came to the right place.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.508
Should we call Todd,
see if he wants to join us?

07:46.591 --> 07:49.469
I'm tired of trying to figure out
what Todd wants.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.554
And what do you want?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.349
-I'll start with a whiskey.
-My kind of girl.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.685
-So then we had sex.
-What? Why?

07:56.768 --> 08:00.021
I was lonely? She was there?
Why does anyone have sex with anyone?

08:00.105 --> 08:04.818
<i>Intimacy, affection, a deep need</i>
<i>to connect to the world at large.</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:08.488
The same reasons three million people
subscribe to the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

08:08.571 --> 08:10.490
-What?
<i>-I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

08:10.573 --> 08:12.409
<i>Please, continue your story.</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:14.786
-You should go.
-Yeah.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.037
That was a mistake.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.416
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake
for you and a regular mistake for me.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.835
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.921
-What are we gonna tell Todd?
-Nothing, obviously.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.257
-I don't want to hurt him.
-Neither do I.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.301
-That's why we won't tell him.
-I feel like we should tell him.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.846
That feeling is you selfishly
trying to assuage your guilt.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.724
If you cared about Todd,
you would keep this a secret forever.

08:35.807 --> 08:36.975
I'm not good at lying.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.146
Ask me if when I was a little girl,
did I ever used to put a stuffed animal

08:41.229 --> 08:43.231
in my underpants
and rock back and forth on it.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.900
When you were a little girl,
did you ever do that thing you said?

08:45.984 --> 08:48.486
What? Get-- No!

08:49.362 --> 08:52.240
I think it's gonna be fine.
Why would it even come up?

08:52.323 --> 08:54.367
Not like there's any reason
the three of us

08:54.451 --> 08:56.327
would ever be in a room together again.

08:56.411 --> 08:58.288
BoJack, you remember Emily, right?

08:58.371 --> 09:01.249
-I've never seen you before in my life.
-No.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.085
-You don't remember BoJack?
-Oh, yeah. BoJack.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.338
What... why... What are you here?
Why are you doing at Todd's house?

09:07.422 --> 09:08.923
Todd's house? This is my house.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.594
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?
That's not gonna be weird?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.220
What? Why would that be weird?

09:14.304 --> 09:16.222
-What are you implying?
-Nothing.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.309
It's not weird for me either,
if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.688
-Okay, what is going on here?
-Why would you? I don't even--

09:23.772 --> 09:25.982
-Literally nothing going on.
-No, something's going on.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.650
I've got a nose for news.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.528
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter
representing the variable

09:30.612 --> 09:31.946
for "What Is Going On?"

09:32.030 --> 09:34.240
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?

09:34.324 --> 09:39.079
I think someone's not saying something
to someone else about something.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.457
-That's crazy.
-I know what it is.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.334
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.462
No one wants to say it out loud
because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.006
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.675
Yes. Your stupid business
is gonna be very successful.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.260
-Yes.
-Glad that's out in the open.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.888
We all know what everyone was thinking,
we don't need to ask

09:56.971 --> 09:59.099
any more questions
or do any wondering about mysteries.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.016
Nope.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.228
If you'll excuse me,
I need to go watch a sport.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.479
Great idea.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.649
The worst part is things have actually
been going really well with Todd.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.734
Our friendship is in a really good place.

10:09.818 --> 10:10.777
Last week he said,

10:10.860 --> 10:13.613
"Did you know the wiener dog
is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

10:13.696 --> 10:16.574
Instead of saying,
"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."

10:16.658 --> 10:18.827
<i>So, why did you</i>
<i>sleep with Emily?</i>

10:18.910 --> 10:22.747
<i>Do you think that part of you was getting</i>
<i>uncomfortable with that closeness?</i>

10:22.831 --> 10:25.500
<i>You felt like you didn't deserve</i>
<i>Todd's friendship</i>

10:25.583 --> 10:29.546
<i>and you wanted to somehow</i>
<i>externalize that feeling into action?</i>

10:29.629 --> 10:33.174
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.
Can't it just be that?

10:33.258 --> 10:34.717
When you do bad things,

10:34.801 --> 10:38.471
you have something you can point to
when people eventually leave you.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.308
It's not you, you tell yourself,
it's that bad thing you did.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.727
<i>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</i>

10:44.811 --> 10:48.523
<i>Are you afraid of being known</i>
<i>and knowing others?</i>

10:48.606 --> 10:51.484
Yeah, you know, I think that you're
definitely hitting on something real

10:51.568 --> 10:53.570
that I would love to drill down into,

10:53.653 --> 10:56.030
but I gotta go
to this marketing meeting now.

10:56.114 --> 10:59.200
Which is so annoying
because I totally want to keep talking

10:59.284 --> 11:00.952
about that thing you're talking about.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.537
But marketing meetings, right?

11:02.620 --> 11:05.290
I mean, they're so important.
Can I call you back tomorrow?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.208
<i>-Of course.</i>
-Great. Bye.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.255
<i>-So, how was your marketing meeting?</i>
-Weird.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.466
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. We're just getting started.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.093
I had the worst morning.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.845
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.263
So I drove here, right?

11:20.346 --> 11:24.350
<i>I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage</i>
<i>when I realize I don't have my key card.</i>

11:24.434 --> 11:26.519
<i>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</i>

11:26.603 --> 11:29.272
<i>When I got there,</i>
<i>I couldn't find it anywhere.</i>

11:29.355 --> 11:32.525
<i>Suddenly, I remember:</i>
<i>I put it in the glove compartment.</i>

11:32.609 --> 11:34.652
<i>It was in my car the entire time.</i>

11:34.736 --> 11:35.904
Okay.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.198
Because I was driving back and forth
so much, I ran out of gas.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.742
I pulled into a 76.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.870
I was about to pump the gas,
I realized I didn't have my credit card,

11:43.953 --> 11:46.122
when I remembered
it was on my desk at home

11:46.205 --> 11:48.708
because I used it to contribute to
my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.626
Diane...

11:49.709 --> 11:52.337
Have you donated
to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.340
-Oh, shit.
-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.051
Yeah, but I don't like feeling
like I have to, Roxy.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.386
Does the world need
a stop-motion short film

12:00.470 --> 12:02.263
about a pig who goes to circus school?

12:02.347 --> 12:05.141
Think of it like you're doing
a nice thing for your friend.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.643
Mmm... okay.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.562
<i>I called a cab to take me home</i>
<i>to get my credit card.</i>

12:09.646 --> 12:13.066
Then back to the gas station, get my car,
fill it up and come here.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.193
So that's why I'm late.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.154
-Why did you tell us that whole story?
-I don't know.

12:18.237 --> 12:22.325
-Why did you tell me that whole story?
-I don't know.

12:22.408 --> 12:27.038
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up
some options for the new <i>Secretariat </i>ads.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.041
Good news is the movie
is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.669
If everyone loves it,
why do we need a new ad campaign?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.046
These are
the "For Your Consideration" ads.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.841
They're a reminder to the Academy,
"Have you considered this yet?"

12:38.925 --> 12:41.427
The Academy doesn't always
consider everything.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.972
So they need constant
consideration reminders.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.182
-That's very considerate.
-This one tested the best.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.434
That's a good one.
The rest of these suck.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.812
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.939
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.608
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.694
-I am really good at this.
-Huh.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.823
-I kind of like this one.
-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.074
We ruled that one out.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.575
It's actually really powerful.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.537
<i>What spoke to you</i>
<i>about </i>that <i>particular ad?</i>

13:07.620 --> 13:08.913
<i>I don't know.</i>

13:08.997 --> 13:11.582
<i>All the pictures of me,</i>
<i>they looked backwards.</i>

13:11.666 --> 13:15.211
<i>When I looked at the mirror ad,</i>
<i>I was seeing me as I see myself</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:17.797
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>there was something beautiful about that.</i>

13:17.880 --> 13:19.382
<i>Intimate, almost.</i>

13:19.465 --> 13:21.634
Of course you like this ad.
When you look at it

13:21.718 --> 13:23.678
you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.098
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?
No? You're just some old turtle?

13:27.181 --> 13:30.935
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."
-But you've got the heart of a champion.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.396
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars
who say different.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.190
Isn't that the point of the movie,
that anybody could be Secretariat?

13:36.274 --> 13:39.527
The point of the movie is to make
a lot of money and win awards.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.779
If anyone who looks at this ad
is Secretariat,

13:41.863 --> 13:43.406
why should you win the Oscar?

13:43.489 --> 13:47.869
He's right, BoJack. Why don't you
leave this to the experts, okay?

13:49.162 --> 13:53.082
Yes. You're a star.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.252
<i>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</i>

13:56.335 --> 13:58.921
<i>Yeah, couple times.</i>
<i>We have a very complicated relationship.</i>

13:59.005 --> 14:00.214
It's complicated.

14:00.298 --> 14:04.093
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep
movie, it would be <i>Doubt.</i>

14:04.177 --> 14:06.888
Don't forget, you have <i>Ellen</i> tomorrow.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.514
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.350
Yes. You're in charge.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.979
Okay, you know, I gotta say
I don't feel like I'm in charge.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.648
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,
forget the whole thing.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.610
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we
having sex in my car?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.196
-Can we at least go back to your place?
-No, BoJack.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.864
I don't know where you live.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.992
You control every part of my life,
I don't know anything about you.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.621
-You don't want to know me, BoJack.
-No, I do.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.457
-I want to be known and know others.
-You don't.

14:34.540 --> 14:40.004
I know you and I know what you want.
This is exactly what you want.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.465
<i>What do you think she meant by that?</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:45.259
Better question:
Why am I still getting the <i>L.A. Gazette?</i>

14:45.343 --> 14:50.431
Do you think getting the paper every day
is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?

14:50.515 --> 14:54.352
<i>The project he abandoned</i>
<i>to make time for the old girlfriend</i>

14:54.435 --> 14:56.562
<i>you spent an intimate night with?</i>

14:56.646 --> 15:00.066
Could that be why you want
to cancel your subscription?

15:00.149 --> 15:03.528
No. I want to cancel my subscription
because newspapers are dumb.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.446
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.740
Every morning,
someone knocks on my door and says,

15:07.824 --> 15:09.367
"Throw away this garbage for me."

15:09.450 --> 15:12.453
So you don't feel any guilt
about your tryst with Emily?

15:12.537 --> 15:15.289
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.459
- You're silly.
- No, you're silly.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.460
Oh, God.

15:19.544 --> 15:22.380
-Okay, your turn, truth or dare.
-Truth.

15:22.463 --> 15:27.093
What is the worst recent thing you did
to someone who cared about you?

15:27.176 --> 15:30.805
-The worst thing? Or the most recent?
-Both.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.641
Can you keep it down, please?
Some people are trying to sleep.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.852
-We are keeping it down.
-We've been really quiet.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.395
-You're basically shouting.
-Sorry.

15:37.478 --> 15:41.858
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?
-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.068
No, because then I'll hear the
"psst, psst, psst."

15:44.152 --> 15:46.779
And I'll be up all night
wondering what you're talking about.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.615
-Uh, what would we be talking about?
-Yeah, BoJack.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.659
What would we be talking about?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.327
I don't know. Dumb stuff.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.205
Forget it. Can't sleep here.
I'm gonna go sleep in my boat.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.181
Freeze, candy ass.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.766
-Character Actress Margo Mart--?
-I said, "Freeze."

16:15.850 --> 16:19.145
<i>Hold on. Are you telling me</i>
<i>esteemed character actress</i>

16:19.228 --> 16:23.983
<i>and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale</i>
<i>has been living in your boat?</i>

16:24.066 --> 16:27.236
Is this one of those situations where
everything we discuss is confidential,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.155
due to customer
service rep-client privilege?

16:29.238 --> 16:30.531
Of course.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.700
Then yes,
Margo Martindale is living in my boat.

16:33.201 --> 16:37.705
-How long have you been in here?
-Well, after the incident in Yorba Linda.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.338
Eh...

16:45.421 --> 16:46.881
Well, Margo, old gal,

16:46.964 --> 16:49.258
looks like you've bought yourself
another day of freedom.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.177
But at what cost?

16:51.260 --> 16:54.430
I knew I had to lay low.
Go off the grid, disappear.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.182
I know what "lay low" means.

16:56.265 --> 16:59.310
<i>So, I disappeared for a little bit.</i>

17:01.270 --> 17:02.104
Mm-hmm.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.691
<i>Somewhere I knew I had no chance</i>
<i>of being discovered--</i>

17:05.775 --> 17:07.985
<i>regional theater.</i>

17:08.069 --> 17:12.573
<i>I did a run at the La Jolla Playhouse</i>
<i>in an obscure Tennessee Williams play.</i>

17:12.657 --> 17:14.742
I have ambition, sir.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.871
Dreams that don't incorporate
the concerns of cynics like you.

17:18.955 --> 17:22.291
Cynic.
Always laughing that terrible laugh.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.585
-Ramona...
-Well, go ahead and laugh.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.296
Laugh your life away. I can laugh, too.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.133
Ramona, I'm telling you...

17:43.479 --> 17:45.856
She's dead.

17:48.859 --> 17:51.028
<i>I was good. Too good.</i>

17:51.112 --> 17:54.448
<i>The </i>San Diego Union-Tribune
<i>called me, "A talent to watch."</i>

17:54.532 --> 17:56.367
<i>I knew I had to get out of there.</i>

17:56.450 --> 17:58.536
And you've been living here ever since?

17:58.619 --> 18:01.080
That's right. I also did an arc
on <i>The Good Wife.</i>

18:01.163 --> 18:03.791
-Other than that, laying low.
-<i>The Good Wife?</i>

18:03.874 --> 18:07.044
How did you go on a nationally broadcast
TV show with no one catching you?

18:07.128 --> 18:11.424
I disappeared into the role, BoJack.
It's called acting. Try it sometime.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.634
And you're the one
who's been stealing our food.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.344
You already know too much.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.762
Smoke bomb.
Hi-yah!

18:18.681 --> 18:21.809
-Why did you throw a plum on the floor?
-Thought it was a smoke bomb.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.227
Where are my smoke bombs?

18:23.311 --> 18:25.187
I'm gonna go sleep by the pool.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.733
-Hey. BoJack's back.
-Yup.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.944
My two favorite people
in a room together with me.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.071
-You bet.
-Isn't this great, BoJack?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.990
-The three of us under one roof?
-Yeah.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.034
It's like <i>Three Men and a Baby.</i>

18:38.117 --> 18:41.454
But there's only two men,
and the baby's a lady.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.788
Uh-huh.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.600
<i>With all this turmoil and upheaval,</i>

19:02.683 --> 19:05.394
sure would be nice to have
something you can depend on.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.230
Something that arrives every day
at your doorstep,

19:08.314 --> 19:09.732
with a robust arts section.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.984
Let me tell you something
about the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

19:12.068 --> 19:14.695
<i>I don't think you finished the story</i>
<i>about your publicist.</i>

19:14.779 --> 19:18.115
What happened when you told her
you wanted to know her?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.367
Oh, right. Well...

19:19.450 --> 19:22.536
If we're gonna work together
and also have weird kinky car sex,

19:22.620 --> 19:24.080
I wanna know something about you.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.247
What do you wanna know?

19:25.331 --> 19:28.209
I was married once.
I have a son I'm not allowed to see.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.087
-My favorite fruit is honeydew.
-Gross, is that true?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.046
Does it matter?

19:32.129 --> 19:34.131
Listen, I've been
with guys like you before,

19:34.215 --> 19:37.468
and I know this thing works better
if we keep a little distance.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.511
And...

19:38.594 --> 19:41.806
- Well, that worked.
- Okay, we're done. I'll see you tomorrow.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.850
<i>So, that's how you left things?</i>

19:44.934 --> 19:47.687
<i>That's how she left things.</i>
<i>But then I followed her home.</i>

19:47.770 --> 19:49.063
<i>You did what?</i>

19:49.146 --> 19:51.607
<i>She lives in this</i>
<i>tiny apartment in the Valley.</i>

19:51.691 --> 19:56.070
<i>I could see her through the window</i>
<i>and I just watched her being... normal.</i>

19:56.153 --> 19:58.364
Oh!

19:58.447 --> 19:59.740
<i>There's something very intimate</i>

19:59.824 --> 20:02.201
<i>about watching a person be herself.</i>

20:02.284 --> 20:05.079
<i>But it wasn't good intimate,</i>
<i>like when you see your mom cry.</i>

20:05.162 --> 20:06.247
<i>It was bad intimate,</i>

20:06.330 --> 20:08.457
<i>like when your dad writes a poem</i>
<i>about Lena Horne's nipples,</i>

20:08.541 --> 20:11.085
<i>makes you read it out loud</i>
<i>so he can hear if it scans.</i>

20:11.168 --> 20:13.546
<i>She warned you</i>
<i>that you wouldn't want to know her.</i>

20:13.629 --> 20:14.714
<i>Yeah. She was right.</i>

20:14.797 --> 20:19.885
<i>It's so sad that when you see someone</i>
<i>as they really are, it ruins them.</i>

20:20.553 --> 20:23.097
-Do you have someone you can talk to?
-About what?

20:23.180 --> 20:27.226
<i>These feelings you have,</i>
<i>your self-destructive behavior.</i>

20:27.309 --> 20:30.104
You know that old joke
about how many psychiatrists

20:30.187 --> 20:33.399
does it take to screw in a light bulb?
The answer is just one,

20:33.482 --> 20:35.860
but the light bulb has to want to change?

20:35.943 --> 20:38.988
-I don't know that joke.
-That's it. That's the whole joke.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.073
The light bulb has to want to change.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.744
Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.829
<i>That's actually not the point of the joke.</i>

20:46.912 --> 20:49.415
-Hey. I need to talk to you.
-What the... I'm on the phone.

20:49.498 --> 20:54.003
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award
from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.546
Oh, it's too much heat.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.673
I'm taking your boat out
to international waters.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.341
You never saw me.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.801
On the phone.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.553
I don't want to talk to anybody.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.889
What I want is to have control
over my own life.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.479
Which is why I'm begging you

21:11.562 --> 21:13.981
to please cancel my delivery
of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

21:14.064 --> 21:16.692
-I don't think you want to do that.
-I promise you I do.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.319
No, because that's just theater.

21:18.402 --> 21:23.532
It allows you to think you're in control,
but the whole idea of control is a myth.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.951
The universe is a wild beast.

21:26.035 --> 21:30.706
<i>You can't tame it.</i>
<i>All you can do is try to live inside it.</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:33.042
Live inside the beast?
That's a mixed metaphor.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.795
-But... you're right.
<i>-Great.</i>

21:35.878 --> 21:38.380
I'm going to sign you up
for another six months.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.343
Since you've been such a sport,
I'm throwing in a tote bag.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.054
Thanks.
You've given me a lot to think about.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.183
Okay, so I'm a passenger.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.978
Remember the three D's:
drive safely, drive efficiently,

21:53.062 --> 21:55.105
and don't harass the passenger.

21:55.189 --> 21:59.527
-Todd, can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure. Driver, pull over, please.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.491
-Can I talk to you alone?
-Of course.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.910
Driver, put up the partition, please.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.583
I've been thinking,
and you should do this without me.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.127
What? But the whole point
is we're doing it together.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.879
But you don't need me anymore.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.631
You have a whole team of coders,

22:20.714 --> 22:23.717
and I don't think that I can work
in this house.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.636
-What's wrong with the house?
-Todd, I just--

22:25.719 --> 22:27.888
I need to go.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.598
I don't understand.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.892
Did I do something
to make you feel uncomfortable?

22:31.976 --> 22:36.230
No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.233
BoJack?
What did he do this time?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.905
I don't think
I've been a very good friend to you.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.366
Things happened and...

22:47.825 --> 22:51.287
I don't think BoJack's been
a very good friend to you either.

22:52.663 --> 22:56.208
-Oh, okay.
-You should buy me out of the company.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.210
No, no, no, keep your share.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.462
Who knows?
It might be worth something someday.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.755
You're sweet, Todd.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.341
You shouldn't waste that on people
who don't deserve it.

23:04.425 --> 23:07.970
Hey, you want this plum?
I found it in the kitchen.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.013
Sure.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.598
Whoa!

23:13.142 --> 23:14.435
Weird plum.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.648
How did you know where I live?

23:19.732 --> 23:20.983
-Ana...
-You need to leave.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.777
No, I know that it's exciting
to remain mysterious and in control,

23:23.861 --> 23:25.112
but control is a myth.

23:25.195 --> 23:27.656
That's a conclusion
I came to recently by myself.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.824
I can't do this now.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.702
I don't want to go home tonight.
I want to sleep in your bed,

23:31.785 --> 23:33.787
I wanna see what
you look like waking up.

23:33.871 --> 23:37.249
You are a beautiful,
sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.085
And I want to know you.
I'm not afraid of that.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.920
And you don't have to be, either.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.299
Okay.

23:45.382 --> 23:49.011
And I want to go with the mirror ads
for <i>Secretariat.</i>

23:49.094 --> 23:50.387
-BoJack, no, listen.
-Ana.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.389
This is my campaign,
I know what I'm doing.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.434
Call up Turteltaub and tell him
I won't be pushed around on this.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.394
I'm the star and what I say goes.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.189
Okay.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.193
Hmm...

24:04.276 --> 24:06.945
It kind of just looks like
a billboard for the sky.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.114
-I didn't think this part through.
-No kidding.

24:09.198 --> 24:12.910
The sky is Secretariat? The sky
wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.828
It is eerily beautiful.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.456
Like an art piece
that resists interpretation.

24:17.539 --> 24:21.126
Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad
for my movie to be interpretable.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.628
If you stand where I'm standing,

24:22.711 --> 24:25.089
you see a reflection
of the KIIS-FM billboard.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.634
Beautiful. So we spent half a million
dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.427
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.097
When the sun goes down
and hits that billboard,

24:33.180 --> 24:36.809
that's gonna--
That's gonna be a real problem.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.978
Well, the good news is
BoJack got what he wanted.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.067
