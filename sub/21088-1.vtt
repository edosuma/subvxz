00:19.728 --> 00:21.446
<i>That's Italian.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:23.406
<i>You can go pump or auto.</i>

00:24.483 --> 00:27.453
<i>The .45 Long Slide
with Lazer sighting.</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:29.321
<i>These are brand new,
we just got them in.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:30.789
<i>That's a good gun.</i>

00:31.657 --> 00:33.751
<i>Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on...</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:36.791
Yeah, I remember after
shooting this scene

00:36.995 --> 00:40.750
thinking, that guy is good.
He outta run for Governor.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.551
Schwarzenegger?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.887
What Schwarzenegger?
Me!

00:47.464 --> 00:49.967
Friend of mine was working
for Roger Corman.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.062
And he had to go drop something off
and I said "Can I go with ya?"

00:53.053 --> 00:56.557
Dick Miller was an essential part
of those early Corman films,

00:56.557 --> 00:57.934
he's in quite a number of them.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.937
<i>You got a thought, or do you want to
sit there and play with your blocks?</i>

01:00.936 --> 01:02.859
<i>I'll play with your blocks,
give him this.</i>

01:02.854 --> 01:06.404
Sometimes he has a small part,
sometimes one of the leads.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.495
Bucket of Blood was probably
Dick's best role,

01:10.487 --> 01:12.364
he played Walter Paisley.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.412
<i>Oh Walter, I want to be with you.</i>

01:14.658 --> 01:16.706
Let's call the character Walter!

01:16.868 --> 01:19.917
<i>- Yo, Walter!
- Hey, Walter, its your wife.</i>

01:19.913 --> 01:24.259
It's just one of those things,
it sort of got attached to him.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.879
<i>Walter Paisley is born!</i>

01:26.878 --> 01:29.597
But you did shoot with naked ladies.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.263
No, I don't remember naked ladies.

01:31.258 --> 01:35.388
Dick did his share of gangsters and he did
policemen. You know, working stiff parts.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.561
I don't know an actor
who has been in the business

01:38.557 --> 01:43.654
as long as Dick has been in the business
who isn't hiding a million wounds.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.491
Dick came out here as a writer
and that's what he wanted to do.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.110
Our childhood was probably
like everybody else's.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.034
Who knows, you know, you hear stories,
you don't hear stories.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.624
I've been mistaken for him
several times

01:55.616 --> 01:57.664
and I always thought
I was better lookin' than him.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.003
<i>Sorry, pal, you're over
the limit on this card.</i>

01:59.995 --> 02:02.498
He's that guy. He's the guy
that when you're watching

02:02.497 --> 02:04.625
a movie and you see him you say

02:04.625 --> 02:06.753
"There's that guy!
He's in everything."

02:06.752 --> 02:09.005
He's like the Washington
Monument of actors.

02:09.003 --> 02:11.598
You can't turn on the TV
or go to the movies

02:11.590 --> 02:14.969
without seeing this man's career
spill out before you.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.767
<i>Listen, punk, I've handled jaywalkers
who were tougher than you.</i>

02:17.763 --> 02:19.231
<i>I do hope you'll write my book.</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:22.442
I grew up with Dick Miller.
I mean I really did.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.687
- Ever flub a line?
- No.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.609
<i>I take Master Charge,
American</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:29.654
<i>Express...
I blew the fuckin line!</i>

02:29.650 --> 02:31.527
Yeah, maybe once or twice.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.029
Dick Miller is the quintessential
character actor.

02:34.029 --> 02:36.782
<i>Lets get outta here.
I hate cul de sacs.</i>

02:36.782 --> 02:39.035
<i>There's only one way out
and the people are weird.</i>

02:39.034 --> 02:41.287
He's in every Joe Dante movie, isn't he?

02:41.953 --> 02:43.500
What was he in "Innerspace"?

02:43.497 --> 02:45.670
<i>Would you shut up,
get back in your cab!</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:48.215
I never thought of being a filmmaker,
I was going to be a cartoonist,

02:48.210 --> 02:51.760
I was just a film fan. But then when finally
I got a chance to make a movie

02:51.755 --> 02:54.850
I couldn't do it without Dick Miller.
I had to have Dick Miller in it.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.344
Joe seems to adore Dick,

02:57.344 --> 02:59.472
they seem to get along fantastically.

02:59.471 --> 03:03.647
What's so great about Dick is,
it's the fact that he's so Dick Miller.

03:03.642 --> 03:07.363
He's so himself.
Completely, 100 percent,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.777
undiluted pure Dick Miller.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.151
He's so completely authentic.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.073
You're never going to steal
a scene from him.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.618
Because how can you steal a scene
from somebody who's so real?

03:16.613 --> 03:19.082
You're never going to steal
a scene from reality.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.667
<i>- No, that's what I said.
- No that's what I said.</i>

03:20.659 --> 03:22.912
<i>- No, I said forget it.
- I forgot about it already.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:50.401
We're in New York
because Dick is doing a film.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.149
I'm so excited.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.110
Back in New York,
this is my stomping ground,

03:55.110 --> 03:58.455
I started out here - a Bronx boy.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.200
I haven't been here in a
couple of years. It's nice.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.958
This one is with Abe Vigoda

04:05.245 --> 04:07.293
and its called "Cutaways".

04:07.289 --> 04:08.962
I've never worked with him before.

04:08.957 --> 04:12.803
He's a nice, quite old gentleman.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.263
My friends are still amazed
and the people that I work with

04:15.255 --> 04:18.428
that my brother's an actor
and he's been in so many films

04:18.425 --> 04:21.769
and he's such a well known face.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.481
You look at him and you say:
"I know that guy."

04:24.473 --> 04:26.441
But he made so many films,
someone once told me

04:26.433 --> 04:29.232
he made about 300
which is an awful lot.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.729
<i>Can we have the check?</i>

04:30.729 --> 04:32.197
<i>It's on the house.</i>

04:32.189 --> 04:33.657
<i>- Really?
- Sure, what the hell.</i>

04:33.648 --> 04:35.491
<i>Different rules apply when it
gets this late,</i>

04:35.484 --> 04:38.078
<i>it's like after hours.</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:41.282
I love having him around.
I just love working with him.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.034
Cause Dick's got a New York accent.
You feel at home.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.662
Dick is a dyed in the wool
kind of New Yorker,

04:46.661 --> 04:50.165
he's a super authentic guy,
he's a no bullshit guy.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.753
This is my first professional picture.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.222
"Sorority Girl".

04:57.672 --> 05:00.767
Featuring Dick Miller.
Here's some more junk.

05:01.468 --> 05:06.099
This is from "Gremlins".
This is a Walter Paisley sign.

05:06.097 --> 05:09.192
I've got Walter Paisley signs
all over the house.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.900
- "The Undead".
- You played a leper in that movie, right?

05:12.896 --> 05:15.115
Yeah, he cleared up my skin nice.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.529
This is "War of the Satellites".

05:17.526 --> 05:19.153
"Rock All Night".

05:19.152 --> 05:21.325
How many movies did you do
for Roger, do you remember?

05:22.489 --> 05:25.993
I've been associated with him
in about 49.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.960
49 pictures.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.914
That's he's either directed or produced,

05:30.914 --> 05:32.757
or something or the other.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.919
The first film Dick and I
worked on together

05:35.919 --> 05:37.466
was "Apache Woman".

05:37.462 --> 05:41.467
A two week western.
It was my third or fourth picture.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.060
I was just learning
how to be a director.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.560
I was five when he made his first movie

05:50.976 --> 05:54.401
"Apache Woman"
where he plays Tall Tree.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.070
<i>I would've made a great
Apache Chief I.</i>

05:57.774 --> 05:59.617
<i>Wouldn't I have, Tall Tree?</i>

06:00.193 --> 06:02.287
<i>Good Chief.
You Chief now</i>

06:02.279 --> 06:05.783
And I think really that's the secret
to his longevity in the film industry

06:05.782 --> 06:08.581
is his height. Because there's always
room for somebody

06:08.577 --> 06:10.329
who is that small.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.831
You'll have to ask Dick
about his secret.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.129
I have no idea what his secret is.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.719
I was playing an Indian
in my first picture,

06:17.711 --> 06:21.215
and I felt good about it. He says:
"When you finish your work here,

06:21.214 --> 06:24.593
how would you like to play
a Homesteader for me?"

06:24.593 --> 06:26.812
I said: "Yeah, sure.
When does that start?"

06:26.803 --> 06:28.305
He says: "Tomorrow! ".

06:28.305 --> 06:31.275
So I played a Cowboy
and an Indian in my first movie.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.361
I think, part of the success of Corman,

06:34.352 --> 06:36.775
was that everything was well
planned in advance.

06:36.771 --> 06:40.651
Roger Corman was a well-educated
young man

06:40.650 --> 06:43.324
who sort of stumbled into
the movie business.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.199
Corman was his own director
and producer and he knew

06:46.197 --> 06:49.167
how to make these films,
quickly and efficiently

06:49.159 --> 06:52.288
and had no pre-tense about
them being great art.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.460
<i>Won't know when they're laying
that track for two weeks yet.</i>

06:54.456 --> 06:57.585
<i>- We're all waiting for that big letter.
- Yeah, and I'm waiting to carry it.</i>

06:57.584 --> 06:59.962
Roger was on a Western kick then.

06:59.961 --> 07:04.011
I played cowboys for him,
I played a Pony Express rider for him.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.135
I was making a buck.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.762
Dick came out as an actor
from New York

07:08.762 --> 07:11.185
and started getting cast
in all those movies

07:11.181 --> 07:13.604
and became this presence.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.774
Frankly, at the time of those movies,
I wasn't aware of Dick.

07:16.770 --> 07:21.071
But looking at it in retrospect, he's the thread
that you see throughout those movies.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.659
He's like the everyman.

07:22.651 --> 07:27.532
Jonathan Haze, by the way, is the one
who introduced me to Roger the first time.

07:27.530 --> 07:31.251
<i>- What do you do, kid?
- I'm here to keep Mr. Johnson healthy.</i>

07:32.702 --> 07:34.875
I don't even think we had
each other's phone numbers.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.965
- No, who had telephones?
- Right.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.301
- <i>How about I go rustle some cows?
- Ah, don't be stupid.</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:41.545
- <i>Who s stupid?
- You! Whose got any cows out here?</i>

07:41.544 --> 07:43.638
<i>Alright, I'll go rustle some chickens.</i>

07:43.630 --> 07:45.678
That was all pretty much ad-Iibed.

07:45.674 --> 07:49.724
But it was the first time that Dick and I
got to work together as a comedy team.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.813
<i>- It's not here?
- Si, way back in there.</i>

07:51.805 --> 07:53.648
<i>It's too big for this little squad,
I think.</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:57.486
And it gave Roger some ideas
about us playing comedy

07:57.477 --> 08:01.402
that paid off later on with "Bucket of Blood"
and "Little Shop of Horrors".

08:01.398 --> 08:04.277
Jonathan Haze,
Dick calls him Jackie.

08:04.275 --> 08:09.076
But, he's Jonathan Haze. They've been
together as friends since New York.

08:09.072 --> 08:12.201
They're known each other longer
than Dick knows me.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.418
When Jonathan Haze said he was
going to introduce me to Roger,

08:17.414 --> 08:20.759
I thought, I'm gonna sell him some
Science Fiction if I could.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.297
Didn't happen.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.671
Roger at that time,
he said: "What do you do?"

08:24.671 --> 08:26.924
I said I'm a writer.
He said: "We don't need writers,

08:26.923 --> 08:28.766
we need actors."
I said: "I'm an actor!"

08:28.758 --> 08:30.556
The State Theater in Boonton,
New Jersey.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.600
That's where I saw my first
Dick Miller movie

08:32.595 --> 08:34.438
which was "Not of this Earth".

08:38.268 --> 08:41.020
<i>Mornin'. I represent the Air Wave
Vacuum Cleaning Company.</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:43.570
<i>- You the gentlemen of the house?
- This is my house.</i>

08:43.565 --> 08:45.283
<i>Crazy. I'd like to show you
the product.</i>

08:45.275 --> 08:47.698
I didn't know Dick, because I hadn't
seen any of his other movies.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.164
But the vacuum cleaner salesman
definitely made an impression on me

08:51.156 --> 08:53.955
so that when I saw him again,
in another AIP picture,

08:53.950 --> 08:56.294
"Oh, that's the guy!
That's the vacuum cleaner guy."

08:56.286 --> 08:58.664
<i>I know that better than you do, sergeant.
How well are you doing?</i>

08:58.663 --> 09:00.882
<i>Half my men are dead.
Nothing can stop that thing.</i>

09:01.249 --> 09:04.970
In "Not of this Earth" Dick plays
a door-to-door salesman.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.759
<i>This, as they say in the vernacular,</i>

09:06.755 --> 09:08.757
<i>is the darling of the
vacuum cleaning world.</i>

09:08.757 --> 09:10.976
And it was really one
of the high-points,

09:10.967 --> 09:13.390
if not THE high-point of the picture.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.764
It's a vacuum cleaner. You purchase,
you don't wanna purchase.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.266
You wanna purchase, you purchase.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.018
<i>I don't want ya to purchase, mister.
I just wanna give you a free demonstration.</i>

09:20.018 --> 09:22.612
<i>You wanna purchase, you purchase.
You don't wanna purchase, you don't purchase.</i>

09:22.604 --> 09:23.981
<i>I ain't gonna force you to purchase.</i>

09:23.980 --> 09:26.199
It was a well-written scene,

09:26.191 --> 09:30.947
but Dick re-wrote it just slightly,
just changed a little bit of the dialoge.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.164
<i>Crazy.</i>
I said: "Wait a second.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.705
Among my many occupations,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.953
I was also a door-to-door salesman."

09:37.952 --> 09:42.048
I said: "And I didn't have a spiel,
I just spoke naturally."

09:42.290 --> 09:44.384
<i>It's a very simple operation.</i>

09:44.375 --> 09:48.221
You know, when people try to do
homages to these B-movies,

09:48.213 --> 09:52.468
they do it sometimes with a wink. The actors
who worked for Corman, never did that.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.847
There's no condescending to the material.
Its done with conviction.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.974
<i>I must have met a thousand cops</i>

09:58.973 --> 10:01.897
<i>and everyone of them is stupid!</i>

10:01.893 --> 10:03.895
<i>Tangling with punks like you
for the kind of money they draw,</i>

10:03.895 --> 10:05.397
<i>maybe they are.</i>

10:05.396 --> 10:08.115
Got a picture here,
it's called "Rock All Night".

10:08.108 --> 10:11.908
I said: "What do I do in it?"
He said: "You're the lead."

10:11.903 --> 10:16.784
In "Rock All Night", Dick played what we
used to refer to as The Little Guy.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.376
<i>Let go of me, you big ape!</i>

10:21.663 --> 10:23.836
You know Dick is a very real guy.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.834
He doesn't cut you any slack.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.919
<i>Fill it, will ya?</i>

10:27.919 --> 10:32.345
And he's got that kinda New York
attitude, in his performances.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.843
<i>Say somethin' nice or I'm gonna
bounce you right off that wall.</i>

10:34.843 --> 10:38.143
- <i>Now start talkin!
- I'm talkin; you Iistenin'?</i>

10:38.138 --> 10:40.766
What he was,
was the underdog

10:40.765 --> 10:44.565
who rises to the occasion
and conquers.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.232
Roger started his career.

10:48.231 --> 10:52.077
All of the people who grew up
in the Corman camp,

10:52.068 --> 10:56.699
wouldn't be using Dick if Dick hadn't been
an actor for Roger Corman.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.957
I grew up in New Jersey
and was a big fan of Roger Corman's.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.626
I went to see
"Attack of the Crab Monsters"

11:03.621 --> 11:05.965
and "Not of this Earth"
when I was eight years old

11:05.957 --> 11:08.301
and I don't think I've ever been
as scared since.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.046
He was able to get the money
to make those little movies.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.844
I guess little by little
he got better at it.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.477
People liked them.
Which surprised the hell out of me.

11:17.468 --> 11:21.098
But in High School I learned
to appreciate Dick Miller.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.475
I learned to appreciate
how he could bring

11:23.474 --> 11:26.273
life to even the smallest of roles.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.613
<i>- We don't have that much time, Dave.
- We've got plenty of time,</i>

11:28.605 --> 11:31.950
<i>- they're just calling for Rocket 1.
- I'm going on Rocket 1.</i>

11:31.941 --> 11:36.993
Dick Miller's first ten feature film
acting jobs were all for Roger.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.700
Dick is top billed in
"War of the Satellites"

11:39.699 --> 11:43.203
and he tries hard to suppress
his Bronx accent

11:43.203 --> 11:45.205
and is pretty successful with it.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.958
<i>Is it fantastic that there's an
intelligent life out there that stops</i>

11:47.957 --> 11:50.255
<i>at nothing to keep us quarantined
on our own planet?</i>

11:50.251 --> 11:52.219
<i>Is the Sigma Barrier fantastic?</i>

11:52.212 --> 11:54.590
But he plays it more like
a leading man,

11:54.589 --> 11:57.138
then the character actor that he is.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.603
And manages,
I think quite convinsingly,

12:00.595 --> 12:04.475
to play against his blue collar persona
and portray a scientist.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.318
<i>It's harder then anything we have
yet been able to devise.</i>

12:07.310 --> 12:09.904
<i>And it has a fantastic
thermal resistance.</i>

12:10.521 --> 12:11.568
<i>Well, I didn't know that.</i>

12:11.564 --> 12:15.694
I think the first movie I saw, was
"War of the Satellites".

12:15.693 --> 12:18.367
I remember years after that
my brother Gene said:

12:18.363 --> 12:20.832
"You know, where did Dick learn
all those big words?"

12:20.823 --> 12:23.793
<i>Have the gentlemen here ask
themselves why these aliens</i>

12:23.785 --> 12:26.163
<i>are so concerned that we do not
penetrate the Sigma Barrier?</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:29.666
If Lenny Bruce could've acted,
he would've been Dick Miller.

12:29.666 --> 12:36.265
Especially the young Dick Miller, cause Dick
had this kind of hipster quality about him.

12:36.255 --> 12:39.054
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Sybill? This is Dave.</i>

12:39.050 --> 12:43.772
One of my absolute favorite moments
in the Dick Miller filmography

12:43.763 --> 12:45.515
is in "War of the Satellites",

12:45.515 --> 12:49.110
where he plays this absolute
hipster scientist.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.321
They never identify him as a hipster,

12:51.312 --> 12:55.192
but you know he's off
boppin' at night, smokin' reefer.

12:55.191 --> 12:58.786
And there's one moment when he
comes in to see Richard Devon.

12:58.778 --> 13:03.249
<i>- Can I ask you a question, personally?
- Certainly.</i>

13:03.241 --> 13:06.211
Dick sits down and does
this little thing with his head

13:06.202 --> 13:08.250
that he sometimes does.

13:08.955 --> 13:13.335
Which is the exact same thing
that Lenny Bruce used to do in his act.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.054
That's the coolest guy in movies, guys!

13:17.046 --> 13:19.970
So that's why when he gets to
play Walter Paisley

13:19.966 --> 13:25.393
people use that as a reference
to who Dick Miller is.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.561
That's not Dick Miller at all.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.688
For a while I was writing
in New York.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.987
So I came out here
with a bunch of stories.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.484
Science Fiction things.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.487
I knew he was writing,
but I really thought that

13:40.486 --> 13:42.784
what was going to happen
in the end would be his acting,

13:42.780 --> 13:47.832
because he's gone to a theatrical school
and he seemed to have a lot of talent.

13:48.202 --> 13:52.423
But I knew he'd been writing, but I didn't
know if he was successful with that or not.

13:52.415 --> 13:56.170
I got out of the service, so I went to
an upholstery school.

13:56.169 --> 14:01.141
I went there and filled out all of the papers,
but there wasn't any night classes anymore,

14:01.132 --> 14:05.182
just the clay classes,
start at 8 o'clock in the morning.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.479
I said: "That's no good, I don't go to sleep
until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning."

14:09.474 --> 14:13.274
Right next to the New York
School of Upholstery,

14:13.269 --> 14:16.193
was the New York Theatre School
of Dramatic Arts.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.159
I called them up and asked
"What time do your classes start?"

14:19.150 --> 14:21.653
He was on his own at a young age.

14:21.652 --> 14:26.203
He always learned to rely on himself
and I think that's good.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.078
I really didn't know much
about acting.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.000
I didn't care to be an actor.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.710
I had fooled around a little,
played drums, sang a little.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.884
So maybe the formative years
and the separation from the parents,

14:39.879 --> 14:43.679
had more of an affect on him than,
psychologically,

14:43.675 --> 14:45.302
he wants to admit.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.689
My mother.
She was an opera star.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.274
She was soprano and very good.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.486
And we were raised really
on that type of music.

14:55.478 --> 14:58.152
But she was very talented,
quite talented.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.860
I was about 8 or 9 years old, I guess.

15:01.859 --> 15:05.409
I came home to just one
of the usual arguments.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.999
Of course my mother
and father divorved.

15:07.990 --> 15:13.668
I think all of his interest in show
business stemmed from his mother.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.212
My mother was prepared
to give up everything.

15:17.834 --> 15:22.305
He just couldn't understand why she wanted
to sing and wanted to be happy.

15:22.296 --> 15:26.642
It had a big affect upon Dick
and I think Dick, over all felt,

15:26.634 --> 15:29.683
my father wasn't fair to his mother.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.354
I didn't know why the got divorced.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.195
My father was living someplace else,
and that was it.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.816
So he went out to California
sort of alone.

15:41.482 --> 15:45.862
You know Gene was going his own way
and we had a large family in California

15:45.862 --> 15:48.706
and they took care of him
to a large extent,

15:48.698 --> 15:50.951
but mostly he took care of himself.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.203
I was busy living life.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.710
And I came out to California

15:56.706 --> 15:59.710
and unfortunately

15:59.709 --> 16:01.632
my mom died

16:01.627 --> 16:05.677
before she could see any of my films.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.638
<i>I will talk to you of art.</i>

16:11.637 --> 16:14.231
<i>For there is nothing else to talk about.</i>

16:14.474 --> 16:16.727
<i>For there is nothing else.</i>

16:17.059 --> 16:19.482
<i>Life is an obscure hobo,</i>

16:19.479 --> 16:22.608
<i>bumming a ride on the omnibus of art.</i>

16:23.065 --> 16:28.196
<i>Burn gas buggies and whip your
sour cream of circumstance.</i>

16:28.196 --> 16:29.789
<i>And hope.</i>

16:29.780 --> 16:33.080
<i>And go ahead and sleep
your bloody heads ofif.</i>

16:33.701 --> 16:36.170
When you talk about
quintessential Dick Miller roles,

16:36.162 --> 16:40.212
the common agreement is that its
Walter Paisley in "Bucket of Blood".

16:40.208 --> 16:43.257
- <i>Yes man, yes!
- Hi.</i>

16:43.252 --> 16:47.473
The image we have of Dick Miller
was created in "Bucket of Blood".

16:47.465 --> 16:51.265
"Bucket of Blood" I think is maybe
my favorite Roger Corman movie.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.934
<i>Hey, that? a pretty far out
name for a statue.</i>

16:53.930 --> 16:55.932
<i>I saw a statue once it was called</i>

16:55.932 --> 16:58.526
<i>"The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me
She Exploded".</i>

16:58.518 --> 17:01.772
It's a role where he does play
kind of an idiot,

17:01.771 --> 17:04.615
even though he's kind of good natured.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.280
<i>You alright, Franky?</i>

17:06.483 --> 17:10.660
Dick is in no sense
like that character in life.

17:10.655 --> 17:15.661
He was much more like the
character in "Rock All Night".

17:15.660 --> 17:18.960
<i>Thought you believed that life was
an obscure hobo, bumming a ride...</i>

17:18.954 --> 17:21.959
<i>I do believe in that, Walter,
but I also believe in creative living.</i>

17:21.958 --> 17:24.176
He could play a comedy role

17:24.167 --> 17:28.048
and bring a depth to it,
and a seriousness to it,

17:28.047 --> 17:30.220
that gave it an added dimension.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.469
<i>The artist is,
all others are not.</i>

17:32.468 --> 17:36.063
<i>That's most intriguing.
Are you an painter?</i>

17:36.055 --> 17:39.275
His ambition is to be an artist.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.486
<i>- What's it called?
- Dead Cat.</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:44.777
He takes the cat and he covers it
with plaster and he shows it to people

17:44.772 --> 17:46.820
and they think it's a great sculpture.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.444
- <i>Man, you are in!
- Oh, Walter...</i>

17:49.443 --> 17:52.538
Then he has to do more
and he kills a man.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.831
So there's interesting levels
of one killing for the sake of beauty

17:57.827 --> 18:02.503
and is that the right thing to do,
is that fraudulent, is it not art?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.466
<i>Yeah, you're a real artist now.</i>

18:04.458 --> 18:07.177
I think people do relate
to Walter Paisley.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.092
We've all been through that;

18:09.088 --> 18:12.342
trying to break in,
trying to get started.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.311
<i>A canvas is a canvas
or a painting.</i>

18:16.053 --> 18:18.647
<i>A rock is a rock or a statue.</i>

18:18.639 --> 18:20.767
Like in all other parts of life

18:20.766 --> 18:23.189
and in social settings,
there's a hierarchy.

18:23.185 --> 18:27.907
People respond to hierarchy, whether its
professional sports and you're the quarterback

18:27.899 --> 18:32.405
or in the this case,
you're the poet or the artist

18:32.403 --> 18:35.407
who is the center of beatnik life
in the coffee shop.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.700
<i>Bring me an Espresso, Walter.</i>

18:37.700 --> 18:40.704
Walter is on the fringe.
He's got no artistic talent,

18:40.703 --> 18:43.627
he's got nothing going for him
and he can't get girls

18:43.623 --> 18:45.967
which is kind of a big motivating
factor for him.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.631
<i>Crazy, what did he say?</i>

18:47.627 --> 18:50.050
<i>- Didn't you hear him?
- No man, I'm too far out.</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:52.014
"Bucket of Blood" is a whoot.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.476
It sort of takes, what would be
a generic, drive-in picture

18:55.468 --> 18:57.687
and all of a sudden gives it
an odd spin.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.188
It's really a sophisticated,
brilliant little satire

19:02.183 --> 19:04.982
for a low-budget, quickie, B-movie.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.071
For some reason,
Chuck Griffith's writing

19:07.063 --> 19:09.862
which could be very dark and funny
at the same time,

19:09.857 --> 19:11.450
was the perfect match for Dick.

19:11.442 --> 19:15.948
Chuck Griffith and I went out and had
dinner and I said to Chuck:

19:15.947 --> 19:20.703
"Let's spend the night going from
beatnik house, to beatnik coffee house

19:20.701 --> 19:26.424
and we will put together and outline
from which you'll do the treatment."

19:26.415 --> 19:30.170
<i>I don't want you to do anymore
statues. Do you understand?</i>

19:30.169 --> 19:32.388
- <i>No more statues.
- Why not?</i>

19:32.380 --> 19:34.508
If you do the lead in the picture,
you do the lead in the picture.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.475
They're all pretty much the same.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.936
But that's the one I like the best.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.977
It really is I think his best performance

19:41.973 --> 19:45.898
and he's been known for it
in sort of a cult way.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.567
<i>Watch, you little</i>

19:49.605 --> 19:51.778
<i>- Did you call me Mr. Mushnik?
- No!</i>

19:51.774 --> 19:56.245
<i>I was calling John D. Rockefeller
for to make a loan on my Rolls Royce!</i>

19:56.237 --> 19:57.955
Oh, I'll tell you something.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.450
But it's the first time I really saw Dick.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.827
He was in a movie called
"Bucket of Blood".

20:03.119 --> 20:04.996
And I knew Antony Carbone

20:04.996 --> 20:07.499
who was in it,
we went to school together.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.751
So naturally I went to see the movie

20:09.750 --> 20:11.752
and Dick was the star.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.927
So, that's how I felt on the set.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.799
<i>Look, here I got a new customer.</i>

20:16.799 --> 20:21.726
When Dick stepped on the set,
you just know that he's somebody special.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.600
- <i>What can I do for you, sir?
- My name is Burston Fouch.</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:26.521
<i>Excellent, I'm Gravis Mushnik.</i>

20:26.517 --> 20:29.191
<i>- Oh, that's a good one.
- Whose gonna get my roses?</i>

20:29.186 --> 20:32.030
"Little Shop of Horrors"
went so fast

20:32.023 --> 20:35.277
nobody had time to have
small talk really,

20:35.276 --> 20:38.871
cause you're running from scene to scene.
It was a two-day movie.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.365
<i>Feed me!</i>

20:41.157 --> 20:45.754
We had to shoot it fast. And a lot of times
we would just have to ad lib

20:45.745 --> 20:48.624
because we'd lose ourselves,
we didn't know where we were.

20:48.622 --> 20:52.718
"Little Shop of Horrors" was the next
picture after "Bucket of Blood".

20:52.710 --> 20:56.465
By the time Roger was getting ready
to do "Little Shop of Horrors",

20:56.464 --> 21:00.810
I'd heard that he had Chuck Griffith
writing a comedy for Dick Miller.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.270
Now came "Little Shop of Horrors".

21:03.262 --> 21:05.264
I said: "What is this?
This is the same character."

21:05.264 --> 21:07.767
Dick read it and decided
that he didn't want to do it

21:07.767 --> 21:10.236
because it was similar to
"Bucket of Blood".

21:10.227 --> 21:12.980
In those clays,
there weren't any sequels.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.984
I resented doing the part.
I said: "I don't wanna do this.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.860
Give it to Jonathan Haze."

21:17.860 --> 21:20.909
I said: "Well, I'll do anything in it
to be working."

21:20.905 --> 21:23.124
- <i>Are you crazy? - You, you!
- Who, Who?</i>

21:23.115 --> 21:26.619
So I felt that it was a good
payback time

21:26.619 --> 21:28.997
by giving him a lead in this picture.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.170
Dick was in scenes with me,
cause I worked in the Flower Shop

21:32.166 --> 21:34.260
and he came in and ate the flowers.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.128
<i>Of course, what else?</i>

21:36.128 --> 21:38.256
I said "Get me clean flowers."

21:39.423 --> 21:41.642
I think he got them from a funeral
house or something,

21:41.634 --> 21:43.853
cause they tasted terrible.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.771
<i>You didn't mean it.</i>

21:45.763 --> 21:49.813
I did have to a certain extent a stock
company, as much as you can.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.278
Dick was one of my favorite actors.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.146
I always thought he was
a brilliant actor.

21:54.146 --> 21:58.697
One of his best friends, Jonathan Haze,
was among them as well.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.786
Well, I mean I've heard that story.

22:00.778 --> 22:06.501
All about stock companies and the Corman
Acting School and all that stuff.

22:06.492 --> 22:10.463
There wasn't any kind of any of that.
There was no stock company,

22:10.454 --> 22:14.300
there was no unified group of actors
that were his group.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.090
If you worked for him and he liked you,
he'd use you again.

22:17.086 --> 22:21.307
Except for Jackie and Jack Nicholson,
we'd all worked together before.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.426
<i>Is this Doctor Forbes office?</i>

22:24.510 --> 22:29.812
Dick's performance in "Bucket of Blood",
was every bit as good

22:29.807 --> 22:32.686
as Jack Nicholson's in
"Little Shop of Horrors".

22:33.769 --> 22:36.648
<i>Oh my God, don't stop now!</i>

22:36.647 --> 22:40.151
Hollywood is not based on talent,
it's not based on anything other

22:40.151 --> 22:42.279
than being in the right place
at the right time

22:42.278 --> 22:45.657
and having within you whatever
that is that somebody wants.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.909
It's all a matter of luck.

22:48.409 --> 22:53.290
"Little Shop of Horrors" is interesting
because, originally Roger wanted

22:53.289 --> 22:56.463
Dick to play the lead character
and he felt, I've already done that,

22:56.458 --> 22:59.007
let Jonathan play it, give me
something else to do.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.880
In a way it seemed like a
missed opportunity

23:00.880 --> 23:03.975
but maybe it sort of,
in some peculiar way,

23:03.966 --> 23:06.640
confirmed his decision that being
the star of the movie

23:06.635 --> 23:09.104
isn't necessarily always
the best thing to be.

23:09.763 --> 23:15.270
There wasn't a large pool
of actors that were

23:15.269 --> 23:19.615
ready to work for Roger Corman.
He worked like lightening.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.905
The only reason Roger
did a second take,

23:21.901 --> 23:23.949
was if the camera fell over.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.499
He did his best work
in casting his pictures.

23:28.490 --> 23:33.712
I think that when a newcomer coming along,
did a good job for him,

23:33.704 --> 23:36.548
he'd say: "Lets use him again."

23:36.540 --> 23:38.793
<i>In the name of the government of France</i>

23:38.792 --> 23:41.420
<i>I order you to open this door!</i>

23:44.673 --> 23:47.347
<i>You'll pardon young sir,
I was up by devotion.</i>

23:47.343 --> 23:48.845
<i>I did not hear you.</i>

23:48.844 --> 23:53.395
<i>I'm sorry, sir. But surely I made
enough noise to awaken the dead.</i>

23:53.390 --> 23:57.236
I don't know what Jack really
wanted to do at the beginning.

23:57.228 --> 24:01.108
- <i>Yes, Baron?
- Cognac, for our guest.</i>

24:01.690 --> 24:03.237
<i>Yes, Baron.</i>

24:03.233 --> 24:05.827
He was ill-suited for the part.

24:05.819 --> 24:09.540
Right after that he did some other
pictures he was marvelous in.

24:10.074 --> 24:13.544
The legend goes that Roger wrapped
"The Raven" three days early.

24:13.535 --> 24:18.382
So he still had Karloff under contract
and the sets were still standing.

24:18.374 --> 24:21.173
So he just decided to shoot another
movie right then and there.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.263
Even as a kid I had no clue
what that movie was about.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.976
He really didn't have a script, so they would
just scribble down a bunch of stuff.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.891
You know, Roger would Boris
walk across the room;

24:30.886 --> 24:32.934
change his jacket and walk back.

24:32.930 --> 24:36.275
Karloff just walks through this
movie in smoking jackets.

24:36.267 --> 24:40.613
"Where do you want me, Roger?
Three days is much, too much time."

24:40.604 --> 24:42.698
None of this was cutting together.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.658
When Karloff did "The Terror"he said:

24:44.650 --> 24:47.324
"I never want to hear that
man's name again."

24:47.319 --> 24:50.163
And I always thought that was funny
because Vincent Price said:

24:50.155 --> 24:54.752
"I hear it all the time and don't have a problem
with it, but Boris was kind of cranky."

24:54.743 --> 24:58.793
Plus he had guys like Monte Hellman
and Francis Coppola and Jack Hill

24:58.789 --> 25:00.291
out shooting second unit stuff.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.134
<i>Allow me to show you something.</i>

25:02.126 --> 25:04.845
Well, one of the problems
with the movie also was

25:04.837 --> 25:08.842
that, for a horror movie it didn't
really have the kind of scenes

25:08.841 --> 25:11.264
you really want for a horror movie.
So I added in a scene

25:11.260 --> 25:15.515
where the Jonathan Haze character
is up on top of a cliff.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.267
Somehow I got the role
of a deaf mute!

25:18.267 --> 25:20.770
This falcon comes down
out of the sky,

25:20.769 --> 25:23.192
flies into his face
and tears his eyes out.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.534
So Jack Nicholson grabs Dick.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.700
"Alright! Tell me everything
that's going on around here!"

25:30.696 --> 25:33.950
<i>The Baron did return that night to find
Eric with the Baroness and he did kill her.</i>

25:33.949 --> 25:36.122
And then Dick spends the next minute
and a half or so,

25:36.118 --> 25:39.668
literally summarizing the entire
plot up to that point,

25:39.663 --> 25:42.462
including things he could not
possibly have known!

25:42.458 --> 25:44.677
But it got the audience up to speed

25:44.668 --> 25:47.171
and made the picture
half-way sensible.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.476
I like that picture. I liked wearing
all the weird costumes

25:52.468 --> 25:56.223
and being crazy. And it was good
working with Boris Karloff

25:56.221 --> 25:58.770
who was an old hero of mine.

25:58.766 --> 26:02.737
My thrill of a lifetime,
was working with Boris Karloff.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.481
I think Karloff, Gable and Cagney

26:05.481 --> 26:09.111
were the three big giants
that I met in this business.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.989
The actors today, they're nice guys,
but they're not giants.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.082
As much film history as he's seen.

26:15.073 --> 26:19.123
And given where he started with
Jack Nicholson and that whole gang.

26:19.119 --> 26:22.168
You would expect to see some
bitterness or something in him,

26:22.164 --> 26:25.259
that a lot of the people around him
went on to make it big.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.130
And Dick is still playing
the smaller roles.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.757
<i>Write your thoughts down here
and he will read them to you.</i>

26:31.757 --> 26:33.930
<i>Just by pressing them
against his forehead.</i>

26:33.926 --> 26:36.395
<i>Anything you want to write,
anything at all.</i>

26:36.387 --> 26:38.481
<i>How about my mother-in-laws will?</i>

26:38.472 --> 26:41.942
He's a throwback to the studio
system actors, you know?

26:41.934 --> 26:44.608
I knew about whatever he
was doing at the time,

26:44.603 --> 26:49.154
but we were so involved
in starting our relationship,

26:49.149 --> 26:54.747
I didn't really get involved in
knowing about his work.

26:57.408 --> 27:00.787
I saw my husband in
"War of the Satellites".

27:00.786 --> 27:04.791
I was in the movie theater
with a fella I was dating.

27:04.790 --> 27:08.010
I made one of those unforgivable,

27:08.001 --> 27:11.346
embarrassing, glib remarks
at the time. I said:

27:11.338 --> 27:14.968
"That guy could put his shoes
under my bed, any time."

27:14.967 --> 27:19.313
When I was sixteen,
I runned up in California.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.557
And Dick came a little bit later

27:21.557 --> 27:24.436
and started working on his own career.

27:24.435 --> 27:27.689
Then he met Elaine.
And he got outta my house.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.111
<i>Carla...</i>

27:31.775 --> 27:33.698
<i>I don't wanna make statues anymore.</i>

27:33.694 --> 27:36.072
<i>I wanna get married.
To you.</i>

27:36.071 --> 27:39.291
I came here when I was
seventeen-and-a-half.

27:39.283 --> 27:43.504
Another actor introduced me
to Dick in Schwab's.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.125
I almost fell flat on my face.
That I was meeting this guy,

27:47.124 --> 27:53.632
that I had seen a couple of years
earlier in a picture.

27:53.630 --> 27:57.806
I met Dick in May 1959

27:57.801 --> 28:01.305
and we got married
the following October.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.266
Five months.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.894
It's a terribly good relationship.

28:06.894 --> 28:10.239
Its shown over the years.
She was in show business at the time.

28:10.230 --> 28:14.485
I'm trying to remember
when I met Lainie.

28:14.485 --> 28:18.115
I think I knew Lainie was in
"The Graduate", before I met her.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.458
I think Dick had told me,
that that was her.

28:21.450 --> 28:24.169
Well, what do you want to know
about "The Graduate"?

28:24.161 --> 28:28.007
I mean I'm not Mike Nichols so I can't
answer from his perspective.

28:27.998 --> 28:30.467
He had seen something I did

28:30.459 --> 28:32.712
where I played a Voodoo Witch.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.841
He asked his Production Coordinator,
who that was

28:36.840 --> 28:39.218
and she looked and said:
"Oh my God, that's my neighbor."

28:39.217 --> 28:42.562
And the next thing I know,
she's knocking on my door

28:42.554 --> 28:45.307
saying "Mike Nichols wants you
for The Graduate."

28:49.937 --> 28:51.280
<i>Sit down.</i>

28:55.150 --> 28:57.027
That's how it happened,
I asked Dick

28:57.027 --> 29:00.782
"Do you mind if I play a stripper?"

29:00.781 --> 29:07.335
It seems that I've gotten known for this
itty bitty role I did in "The Graduate".

29:07.329 --> 29:10.959
Because for its time,
I suppose it was rather racy.

29:10.958 --> 29:15.429
But by today's standard,
it's just another dancer.

29:19.133 --> 29:24.310
This is a portrait that I did
of Dick in 1966.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.897
What inspired you to do it?

29:25.889 --> 29:28.563
Me! Who do you think?

29:29.142 --> 29:32.646
They love being with each other.
They love bickering with each other,

29:32.646 --> 29:34.523
they can have their own radio show.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.525
- What do you mean?
- I don't know what it is.

29:36.525 --> 29:40.621
That's what the trouble is
for fifty-five years or whatever.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.786
- What was our first argument?
- That's what I'm trying to argue about.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.956
Of course I understand that these
two would be together.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.250
You didn't like what I made
you for dinner.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.250
I wouldn't even call it bickering,
it's a sort of...

29:52.249 --> 29:56.470
- Pork chops!
- Pork chops, alright. No, it wasn't.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.761
It's very funny in a sort of sitcom way.

30:00.757 --> 30:03.306
She's never cooked anything since then.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.350
- And you deserve it!
- She has trouble

30:06.346 --> 30:08.189
boiling water.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.775
She doesn't know what
temperature it boils at.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.779
- What temperature does it?
- I don't know.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.245
As all actors can tell you,

30:26.241 --> 30:29.745
it's not a gravy train
all the way through.

30:29.745 --> 30:33.045
The foibles of being an actor,
you just don't get that much work.

30:33.415 --> 30:36.168
The first film I actually worked on,

30:36.168 --> 30:38.091
was in fact "The Wild Angels",

30:38.086 --> 30:41.761
and that I believe was the first
time that I saw Dick Miller.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.931
<i>Hey, what's the matter with you guys?
You're supposed to work around here.</i>

30:44.926 --> 30:46.599
<i>Cool it, I'm just talking to my buddy.</i>

30:46.595 --> 30:48.689
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

30:48.680 --> 30:51.058
<i>What's with the Iron Cross,
you one of those dumb angels?</i>

30:52.476 --> 30:56.697
<i>Their intimacies;
a rape of decency!</i>

30:56.688 --> 30:58.565
Defience of authority.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.533
Not trusting people over thirty.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.119
I think Roger responded to that,

31:03.111 --> 31:07.241
because even though he didn't hang out
in the counter-culture really

31:07.240 --> 31:08.787
except for purposes of research.

31:08.784 --> 31:12.288
I think he had some at least
instinctive sympathy

31:12.287 --> 31:15.257
with the idea of mistrust of authority,

31:15.248 --> 31:17.671
which was something that
he had very strongly.

31:17.667 --> 31:21.137
<i>Their emblems, those of the defeated.
The despised.</i>

31:21.129 --> 31:23.302
I didn't see it happening.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.343
To me a job was a job.

31:26.343 --> 31:28.846
<i>- Cash. Cash, this is Paul.
- How you doing?</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:33.601
At that particular point, he was more
playing the establishment roles

31:33.600 --> 31:36.945
and they were playing the
anti-establishment roles.

31:36.937 --> 31:40.908
I don't know whether it amused him,
I don't know if interested him at all

31:40.899 --> 31:43.652
but he definitely wasn't part of of it,
I never felt.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.121
Listen, I'll tell you something now.

31:46.488 --> 31:50.709
The pay in those clays was I think
300 or 350 dollars a week.

31:50.701 --> 31:53.329
I remember telling my daughter once,

31:53.328 --> 31:56.298
we were talking about money
and I said:

31:56.289 --> 31:59.168
"I got by on fifteen for the year!"

31:59.167 --> 32:02.171
And she said: "Fifteen thousand dollars
is a lot of money."

32:02.170 --> 32:06.016
"Wait a second, wait a second,
fifteen hundred dollars!"

32:07.134 --> 32:09.557
She said:
"You made five pictures."

32:09.553 --> 32:11.430
"That's right."

32:11.430 --> 32:13.774
There just wasn't any money.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.938
There were a couple of years

32:15.934 --> 32:21.191
when so little came into the
house from Dick's acting

32:21.189 --> 32:24.068
and from me going to school.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.116
I remember in those clays
when I first went out to California,

32:27.112 --> 32:29.160
Dick never wanted to leave the house.

32:29.156 --> 32:32.831
I had a lot of agents.
They didn't do a thing for me.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.205
And he wouldn't even wanted to go
ten or fifteen minutes away,

32:36.204 --> 32:38.627
because he was afraid
he'd miss a call.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.505
When I got a call,
I got a part.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.427
<i>Tell us Miss Campbell, did you ever
dream of being a star in those days?</i>

32:47.007 --> 32:50.637
<i>I used to dream about getting away
from Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire.</i>

32:50.635 --> 32:54.765
I remember, maybe forty years ago,
thirty-five years ago

32:54.765 --> 32:58.360
he wasn't getting as many
parts as he deserved.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.775
Gene was the coroner of Orange County

33:00.771 --> 33:02.773
and he got him some interviews.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.072
Dick resisted it in the worst way.

33:06.067 --> 33:09.116
Eventually he said:
"Alright, I'll go to the interviews."

33:09.112 --> 33:12.912
And they set up the interviews
and Dick just never showed up.

33:14.201 --> 33:16.249
I don't know whether I should
laugh at that or not.

33:16.244 --> 33:20.920
Dick is the type of person that does not
want to do, what he doesn't want to do.

33:20.916 --> 33:24.261
Not that he didn't do what he didn't want to do,
but he knew what he did want to do.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.254
And he wanted to be an actor.

33:26.254 --> 33:29.007
And he didn't care if he was
going through a dry spot

33:29.007 --> 33:31.977
or he wasn't getting called
upon in those days,

33:31.968 --> 33:34.892
he was just going to wait it out
and do what he wanted to do,

33:34.888 --> 33:37.232
cause he knew what was
best for himself.

33:37.224 --> 33:41.104
I know and it wasn't easy.
And it never is, I think.

33:41.102 --> 33:44.948
I think the fact that he was liked by
producers and directors helped though.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.285
We couldn't afford vacations,
the truth is.

33:48.276 --> 33:53.954
The very first time we did anything
that resembled a vacation

33:53.949 --> 33:57.499
was when he making
"The Long Ride Home" and I came

33:57.494 --> 34:01.965
You've hurt yourself more than once
on a picture, doing stunts.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.006
I get hurt.
On "The Long Ride Home",

34:05.001 --> 34:07.925
I busted my tailbone

34:07.921 --> 34:09.547
early in the picture.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.178
Did some very, very fancy
riding after that.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.391
Roger had a deal at Columbia

34:19.391 --> 34:22.645
and was preparing to shoot a western,

34:22.643 --> 34:25.568
with Robert Towne re-writing the script.

34:26.815 --> 34:29.739
This script was not
"The Magnificent Seven".

34:34.155 --> 34:38.284
It soon turned out that there were
some very serious people

34:38.284 --> 34:40.913
who thought they were
doing Shakespeare.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.217
The company broke into two camps.

34:46.208 --> 34:50.134
There were The Union soldiers
and The Rebs.

34:50.130 --> 34:53.929
And that's why to this day
I'm friends with Dick Miller.

34:54.801 --> 34:58.681
We stayed in town that had
as many churches as bars

34:58.680 --> 35:01.274
and there were about
twenty shootings every weekend.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.978
The experience was,

35:03.977 --> 35:07.231
how many things on a movie
can be made difficult.

35:10.025 --> 35:14.496
One of the things that may have
been a sign early on,

35:14.487 --> 35:19.789
every day, there would be memos sent around
from Columbia Production Department

35:19.784 --> 35:23.914
such things as the equipment
that would be sent.

35:24.789 --> 35:27.338
And Roger would study these
lists very carefully

35:27.334 --> 35:30.884
and he would instruct me sometimes
to strike things off.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.756
"Two generators?"

35:32.756 --> 35:37.887
"I assume if they send a generator
to location it's going to work."

35:38.720 --> 35:41.269
I remember all the suits came out

35:41.264 --> 35:43.813
and I said: "Whats going on?"
and they said

35:43.808 --> 35:46.652
"He's getting chewed out up there."

35:48.480 --> 35:50.232
Roger wanted some freedom.

35:50.232 --> 35:54.533
He didn't want to move thirty pieces
of equipment to get the shot he wanted.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.450
It was a new way to make a picture

35:56.446 --> 35:58.824
and frankly, I agreed with him.

35:58.823 --> 36:02.293
The Columbia guys were worried
that Roger,

36:02.285 --> 36:06.586
from his AIP, low budget,
exploitation background

36:06.581 --> 36:10.381
was going to make a cheap
looking movie.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.797
"Don't go up there."

36:13.797 --> 36:17.472
"You're gonna pass these guys in the suits
and they'll remember you."

36:17.467 --> 36:19.811
And all kinds of panic
and I said: "Ah, that is bull."

36:19.803 --> 36:21.851
And I did pass a guy on the stairs.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.942
"Are you on this picture?"
I said: "Yeah, I think so."

36:28.478 --> 36:30.822
And we had the directorial change,

36:30.814 --> 36:34.694
the sudden and abrupt dismissal
of Roger Corman.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.787
Which I didn't support then
and I still argue to this clay,

36:37.779 --> 36:40.498
he was going to make a better
picture than we deserved.

36:40.490 --> 36:44.711
He was bent on bringing in the
movie on time and on budget,

36:44.703 --> 36:46.296
even under budget,

36:46.288 --> 36:50.213
and he simply assumed that they
would like it if he did that.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.969
He went off and did another picture.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.056
<i>Hello boys, something I can do for you?</i>

36:56.047 --> 36:58.095
<i>Yeah, you can shut up!</i>

36:58.091 --> 36:59.638
He didn't miss a beat.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.110
I was writing,
I wasn't selling too much.

37:16.109 --> 37:21.707
And at that point, becoming an actor,
I just gave up the writing.

37:22.157 --> 37:24.376
Not entirely, but I decided,

37:24.367 --> 37:26.790
I'm concentrating on something else now.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.164
I sold a couple of scripts.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.713
I remember
"Which Way to the Front?",

37:31.708 --> 37:35.838
with Jerry Lewis. One of the sore
spots of my career.

37:35.837 --> 37:40.138
One of my first movie going experiences
was being taken to see a movie called

37:40.133 --> 37:42.602
"Which Way to the Front?"
with Jerry Lewis

37:42.594 --> 37:45.518
It might be actually Jerry Lewis'
last studio picture.

37:45.513 --> 37:46.981
<i>You're right!</i>

37:46.973 --> 37:50.193
It has a great plot
an this really weird execution.

37:52.479 --> 37:55.278
An acquaintance of mine
who was an actor,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.197
he had worked for Jerry, I guess,
and he bought my script.

37:58.193 --> 38:00.662
And little by little I started
hearing about it.

38:00.653 --> 38:03.156
The studio bought it and all of a
sudden they announced it

38:03.156 --> 38:07.127
and it was in the trades, and I saw
my name's not on there.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.622
And I took it to the guild
and we had a hearing

38:10.622 --> 38:12.124
and I got my credit for it.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.091
<i>I love it! I love it!</i>

38:14.084 --> 38:17.554
What they did was,
they had a re-write on it

38:17.545 --> 38:23.097
and they changed the battle
from the Pacific Islands to Germany.

38:29.265 --> 38:32.815
I like to forgive Jerry Lewis only
because I find like it's so watchable,

38:32.811 --> 38:35.064
even when it's a car crash
it's really watchable.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.116
It was funny for a Jerry Lewis picture.

38:40.777 --> 38:45.624
It's a tough business and its full of hopes
and dreams and disappointments.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.960
I think Dick has gone through a lot

38:48.952 --> 38:53.924
and because of that, I don't think he
allows himself to be totally accessible.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.044
He had a couch and a Murphy Bed.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.546
When we got married,
we just kept all of that stuff,

38:59.546 --> 39:01.844
because I came from Canada,
what did I have?

39:01.840 --> 39:05.811
He had his typewriter.
That was his main possession.

39:06.261 --> 39:09.765
I was just staying alive,
making movies.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.892
I think I must have made
four or five pictures

39:11.891 --> 39:14.394
before I realized I was a movie actor.

39:14.394 --> 39:17.864
I'm still trying to sell scripts,
wasn't selling.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.700
He seems to have come out
here to be a writer

39:20.692 --> 39:25.072
and sort of ignored it completely until
for some reason around 1970.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.073
Which he gets two writing credits.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.292
He gets a writing credit
on a western called

39:29.284 --> 39:31.912
"Four Rode Out" with Sue Lyon.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.960
And he does that and the
Jerry Lewis movie back-to-back.

39:34.956 --> 39:38.881
Maybe working for Jerry Lewis
makes you give it up completely.

39:40.962 --> 39:46.765
It didn't really hit me until the first time
that I was invited to Dick and Lainie's house.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.978
And the two things
that I discovered there

39:48.970 --> 39:53.692
were the photos of Dick
with the big lions and the cats

39:53.683 --> 39:56.357
and I realized how much
they loves animals.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.650
And then there was this art.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.200
That is kind of a strange little face.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.868
What's this?

40:08.990 --> 40:10.583
Here's an interesting thing.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.495
- <i>What have you got?
- It's a thing I made!</i>

40:15.997 --> 40:19.376
They're all made about fifty
years ago, really.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.595
- And did you draw a lot?
- I drew constantly.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.098
I drew thousands of pictures.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.309
These are the few that are left.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.603
'The Family of Man'.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.480
They seem sexual.

40:32.472 --> 40:35.271
I believe all my pictures are sexual.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.644
I just like life that way.

40:37.644 --> 40:40.818
If I drew girls, they loved it
when I drew them

40:40.813 --> 40:44.067
or else it was just strictly
from my imagination.

40:48.738 --> 40:52.333
Was there a particular part of the
anatomy that you liked drawing?

40:52.325 --> 40:54.419
Well God, no!

40:54.410 --> 40:56.333
I guess as I got working as an actor,

40:56.329 --> 40:58.798
the need to draw disappeared.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.631
I got a job once,
"The Andersonville Trial"

41:02.627 --> 41:04.595
because I could draw.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.517
Oh God, there.
That was the set.

41:09.509 --> 41:13.605
<i>Hello, I'm George C. Scott.
It's my happy job this evening to</i>

41:13.888 --> 41:15.856
<i>give you an improvisational introduction</i>

41:15.848 --> 41:17.976
<i>to "The Andersonville Trial".</i>

41:17.976 --> 41:19.899
<i>A play by Saul Levitt.</i>

41:19.894 --> 41:23.489
I asked George C. Scott,
he was the director at the time,

41:23.481 --> 41:25.779
I think it one of the first
things he directed.

41:25.775 --> 41:29.496
I asked him: "Were there many lines?"
He said: "Not too many at all."

41:29.487 --> 41:31.455
"You're playing a court reporter."

41:31.447 --> 41:35.372
And I drew a picture of him,
in about 2 seconds flat.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.497
I said: "You mean, like this?"
"Oh yeah, that's good."

41:42.458 --> 41:47.760
I remember when I was a kid. A guy came
over from Disney, to my mother.

41:47.755 --> 41:50.599
Wanted to stick me in pictures.
I didn't know that,

41:50.592 --> 41:53.141
I thought he was going to make
me an animator.

41:53.136 --> 41:55.230
I said: "Yeah, I wanna do that!"

41:55.221 --> 41:58.646
And then: "You're gonna be an actor."
I said: "Nah, I don't wanna do that."

41:58.641 --> 42:00.268
Who knew...

42:00.268 --> 42:04.739
You want a portrait of yourself?
He'll make it in Pen and Ink in ten minutes.

42:04.731 --> 42:08.326
Dick and my father had a little bit
of an interesting relationship.

42:08.318 --> 42:10.787
If you ask Gene about the
early childhood

42:10.778 --> 42:14.874
"Oh, it was perfectly fine!"
It was perfectly fine, so.

42:16.034 --> 42:19.584
He was a nice guy, but very much
involved in his own life,

42:19.579 --> 42:21.502
his own affairs.

42:21.497 --> 42:26.094
Both Dick and I would see him occasionally
and go to lunch with him or something

42:26.085 --> 42:27.928
and that was really about it.

42:27.920 --> 42:34.804
When I was about 17, 18 years old.
My father put me on an airplane with him

42:34.802 --> 42:37.521
and we were going to California
and he said:

42:37.513 --> 42:41.393
"You're gonna meet some people
who are gonna call me dad."

42:41.392 --> 42:44.362
And I met Dick and Gene.

42:45.188 --> 42:48.192
My father had a drawer in his apartment.

42:48.191 --> 42:51.616
And he had some pictures of Dick
in a movie called "Rock All Night"

42:51.611 --> 42:55.787
where he was on the back of Variety.
And there was pictures of Gene in the Navy.

42:55.782 --> 42:59.127
You know, these guys look so
much like my father

42:59.118 --> 43:02.213
that even as a young kid, I said:

43:02.205 --> 43:06.176
"Something weird here."
But you know, Brooklyn has its own vibe.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.341
I knew about Bill from
the very beginning.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.635
I didn't know that Bill
didn't know about me.

43:11.631 --> 43:14.976
Well, I first saw Bill when I
got out of the Navy

43:14.967 --> 43:16.765
and went home to see my
mother and Dick.

43:16.761 --> 43:19.105
And I went up to see my father

43:19.097 --> 43:22.271
and Bill was his child,

43:22.266 --> 43:24.439
sitting in a high chair.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.021
But Dick will never admit it.

43:27.021 --> 43:31.276
He doesn't have the most positive
thoughts about my father.

43:32.193 --> 43:35.914
My father. Our relationship was,
I just didn't see him that much.

43:35.905 --> 43:38.533
Me? I was the perpetual bum.

43:38.533 --> 43:43.960
He really didn't have any respect for
show business whatsoever, his father.

43:44.664 --> 43:46.666
He was born in Russia in the 1890s

43:46.666 --> 43:48.964
and he came during World War I.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.588
I don't know if he was a Socialist,

43:51.587 --> 43:53.760
but times were different then.

43:53.756 --> 43:57.727
My father was a fighter,
a little bit like Dick, you know?

43:58.469 --> 44:02.349
My father had a temper and he
didn't suffer fools gladly

44:02.348 --> 44:05.852
and Dick doesn't suffer fools gladly.

44:05.852 --> 44:08.822
Sometimes when people have
a lot in common,

44:08.813 --> 44:10.986
there's certain more issues
between them.

44:10.982 --> 44:13.861
But God forbid, if Dick thought
I was psychoanalysing him,

44:13.860 --> 44:16.704
he'd think I was completely crazy.

44:16.696 --> 44:20.166
My father I know was very proud of Dick.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.786
He really was very proud of Dick.

44:23.536 --> 44:26.415
You know, if Dick came from
the perfect family,

44:26.414 --> 44:28.758
I don't know, maybe he would
have been an accountant.

44:29.292 --> 44:31.294
Though that's hard to believe, right?

44:32.503 --> 44:34.722
When Roger started New World Pictures,

44:34.714 --> 44:38.139
he sort of updated the
exploitation formula

44:38.134 --> 44:41.479
that he first worked with
at AIP in the 50s.

44:41.471 --> 44:43.189
And this is now the 70s.

44:43.181 --> 44:46.651
So now things were a little grittier,
the screen was a little freer.

44:46.642 --> 44:50.067
The marvel of all this is that,
the young guys

44:50.063 --> 44:54.284
that Roger hired, they all were fans
of the early Corman films.

44:54.275 --> 44:57.245
They'd grown up on those films
and now they were working for him.

44:57.236 --> 45:01.491
Dick Miller had somehow fallen
out of the Corman Universe.

45:02.575 --> 45:06.125
He hadn't been in a Corman picture
for about four years

45:06.120 --> 45:08.214
and he'd never been in
a New World picture.

45:08.206 --> 45:10.755
I think it was because Roger
had stopped directing

45:10.750 --> 45:12.468
and so he wasn't casting.

45:12.460 --> 45:15.088
I thought it was really wonderful,

45:15.087 --> 45:19.388
that the new young directors
who came in recognized the guys

45:19.383 --> 45:22.933
who had been working with me
and they continued working with them

45:22.929 --> 45:25.728
and Dick was probably
the most important.

45:25.723 --> 45:30.775
I first became very clearly aware
of Dick Miller as a presence

45:30.770 --> 45:33.740
when I started making films
with New World.

45:33.731 --> 45:38.032
In fact I used to read a treatment
or a script and say:

45:38.027 --> 45:39.745
"Wait, where's the Dick Miller part?"

45:39.737 --> 45:43.287
You know Dick is sort of a laid
back guy in the sense that

45:43.282 --> 45:46.627
he never went out to seek work.

45:46.619 --> 45:51.250
It either came to him
or he didn't get work.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.672
I went to film school with Jon,
at NYU.

45:53.668 --> 45:57.468
And I knew of Joe because
Joe and Jon were very good friends.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.682
Jon and I not only went to
film school together,

45:59.674 --> 46:03.474
but we worked at a Rock n Roll theater
together, along with Jonathan Kaplan.

46:03.469 --> 46:07.849
And when Jonathan and Jon came out
to L.A. to work for Roger Corman,

46:07.848 --> 46:10.943
I came out eventually and lived
in their houses for free

46:10.935 --> 46:14.690
and slept in their garage and all that kind
of stuff you did when you were broke.

46:14.689 --> 46:18.785
Jonathan cast Dick in,
I guess it was "Night Call Nurses".

46:18.776 --> 46:22.121
<i>Come and spend the night with
The Night Call Nurses.</i>

46:22.113 --> 46:25.413
<i>They nurse patients the way
no doctor can.</i>

46:25.408 --> 46:27.126
<i>From New World Pictures.</i>

46:27.118 --> 46:30.497
But essentially Jonathan got the first job
and brought everyone else along.

46:30.496 --> 46:33.090
When Jonathan Kaplan gave me
the chance to

46:33.082 --> 46:35.380
write "Night Call Nurses"
with Dan Opatashu,

46:35.376 --> 46:38.676
I was thrilled, I mean that was
the biggest break of my life.

46:38.671 --> 46:41.675
And I said: "Do me a favor,
hire Dick Miller."

46:41.674 --> 46:43.722
"I'll write him a part for the picture."

46:48.598 --> 46:51.852
<i>I don't know how smart it is for a young
lady to be hitchhiking alone at night.</i>

46:51.851 --> 46:56.402
When Dick walked in the room,
it was like: "Oh! I know this guy."

46:56.397 --> 47:00.072
So when he came in to audition,
he was a little put off.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.489
I don't audition good.

47:01.485 --> 47:04.409
He said: "I don't audition.
I read terribly. I'm a terrible reader."

47:04.405 --> 47:06.703
I didn't know who Jonathan Kaplan
was at the time.

47:06.699 --> 47:09.919
"I'm gonna read this and you're gonna say
to me when I'm done, that was terrible."

47:09.911 --> 47:12.084
- Good director.
- He was right!

47:12.079 --> 47:15.299
He can't audition.
"But, you got the part anyway."

47:15.291 --> 47:17.919
Everybody from the Corman camp,
they said:

47:17.919 --> 47:21.219
"If Dick worked for Roger,
he can work for us!"

47:21.464 --> 47:22.886
<i>MY ass!</i>

47:22.882 --> 47:25.101
<i>Hey Gallager, kiss my jolly!</i>

47:25.676 --> 47:28.225
Dick Miller became their
good luck charm.

47:28.221 --> 47:31.725
He's definitely a good luck charm, they used
him in every movie they ever did.

47:32.016 --> 47:35.190
<i>If you're talking about, what I think you're
talking about, I ain't gonna talk about it!</i>

47:35.186 --> 47:36.733
They prayed and hoped

47:36.729 --> 47:40.324
that he would, once again,
pull them through a crappy movie.

47:40.316 --> 47:43.616
He has a Jimmy Cagney
kind of rhythm to his delivery.

47:43.611 --> 47:45.158
<i>He had a gun.</i>

47:45.154 --> 47:47.282
<i>He said he was going to shoot
my ear off. That ain't nice.</i>

47:47.281 --> 47:48.498
<i>Sheriff.</i>

47:48.741 --> 47:51.460
Most good directors,
the first thing they do is

47:51.452 --> 47:53.625
see what the actors are going to do.
Because they may do something

47:53.621 --> 47:55.168
that the director hadn't thought of.

47:55.164 --> 47:57.667
<i>- He's dumb enough to get married.
- Twice.</i>

47:57.667 --> 47:59.169
<i>Well, you saw the first one.</i>

48:02.421 --> 48:06.767
I think Roger has a genuine
affection for Dick,

48:06.759 --> 48:09.683
as much as he has an
affection for anybody.

48:09.679 --> 48:12.683
Especially, if Dick works for scale.

48:12.682 --> 48:14.810
Then definitely the affection is there.

48:14.809 --> 48:16.777
When I came out to Hollywood,

48:16.769 --> 48:20.194
Jon Davison was the head
of publicity for New World Pictures

48:20.189 --> 48:22.908
and he had raided the NYU group

48:22.900 --> 48:24.698
and brought them out to work for Roger.

48:24.694 --> 48:28.119
And so Allan and I became the trailer
department at New World Pictures.

48:28.114 --> 48:31.914
They were just kind of wild men
who came up with these crazy ideas.

48:31.909 --> 48:34.378
<i>Flying out of the sky and onto your lap.</i>

48:34.370 --> 48:37.419
<i>They battle the flying feet
of kung-fu killers!</i>

48:38.916 --> 48:41.760
One of the first trailers that we did
was for "Big Bad Mama".

48:41.752 --> 48:43.299
<i>Angie Dickinson is</i>

48:46.882 --> 48:48.725
<i>Wilma gave her daughters everything.</i>

48:49.468 --> 48:54.019
Dick is in it and I thought, this is a kind
of rough and tough gangster picture

48:54.015 --> 48:56.859
and Dick's got that kinda voice. Maybe we
should get him to do the narration?

48:59.145 --> 49:01.739
Working at New World Pictures
was a lot of fun.

49:07.528 --> 49:10.156
There was definitely structure,
but it was very free wheeling

49:10.156 --> 49:12.705
because everybody was quite young
and just getting started.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.577
It was a very exciting time.

49:15.327 --> 49:18.957
I met Dick Miller in
Griffith Park in 1975.

49:18.956 --> 49:21.880
I got a job from Jonathan Demme,
"Crazy Mama".

49:21.876 --> 49:23.674
It was produced by Julie Corman.

49:23.669 --> 49:27.970
He brought more than his performance
which was always wonderful to look at.

49:27.965 --> 49:30.309
I mean Dick Miller arrives
in whatever scene.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.724
And he brought a certain
presence to the film.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.768
"He's coming tomorrow,
he's gonna work tomorrow!"

49:34.764 --> 49:37.563
And people who weren't even working that
day would show up to see Dick Miller.

49:37.558 --> 49:39.151
The main thing is the film.

49:39.143 --> 49:40.986
You know, you're all there
to make a good film.

49:40.978 --> 49:44.323
Did you do good, were you articulate?
Did you tell the story in a good way,

49:44.315 --> 49:46.738
is it new, did it extend the tradition?

49:46.734 --> 49:48.907
Every part counts.

49:48.903 --> 49:52.282
You know, its like poetry,
each thing adds up to the whole.

49:53.908 --> 49:56.752
There were very few film schools
in those clays,

49:56.744 --> 50:01.250
so for us this was our way of
really learning our trade.

50:01.957 --> 50:07.339
I realized that these first time directors,
it was very important for them

50:07.338 --> 50:09.511
to have an actor on the set

50:09.507 --> 50:11.805
who was good and who they admired

50:11.801 --> 50:14.771
and that they could absolutely rely on.

50:15.638 --> 50:19.108
I found myself not having
to direct him a lot.

50:19.600 --> 50:23.730
There was no need to do other takes.
He made the scenes work.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.824
When he walked in,
I started smiling.

50:26.815 --> 50:29.944
I mean, here was a guy
that I never met before,

50:29.944 --> 50:33.198
and yet I felt like I knew him for years.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.998
When I really had more to do
with Dick Miller,

50:37.993 --> 50:42.749
was when Roger hired him to write
the script for "TNT Jackson".

50:42.748 --> 50:44.250
The thing was a stinker.

50:51.799 --> 50:54.268
I think Roger and I had
a slight argument.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.012
Go into meet with Roger.

50:56.012 --> 50:57.434
It just fell apart.

50:57.429 --> 51:00.433
"Dick, this all just dialogue"

51:00.432 --> 51:02.150
"This is terrible!"

51:02.143 --> 51:05.693
<i>I'll pay you hard cash for raw heroine
any clay at those prices.</i>

51:05.688 --> 51:07.736
And I was supposed to do
the lead in it.

51:07.731 --> 51:11.656
When we wrote "dialogue, dialogue!",
it was with the understanding

51:11.652 --> 51:14.701
that you may not need all of it.
But you may need some.

51:14.697 --> 51:16.995
The re-write was about 90%
of the picture.

51:16.991 --> 51:20.086
The reader needs some dialogue
sometimes to understand

51:20.077 --> 51:23.206
why TNT Jackson is kicking ass.

51:25.749 --> 51:30.550
I don't know, I really literally don't know
what happened after that meeting.

51:30.546 --> 51:34.426
Except I know that, of course I did know
that the script was re-written.

51:34.425 --> 51:37.019
It was probably re-written
on location or so.

51:39.180 --> 51:42.104
He was a brilliant dialogue writer.

51:42.099 --> 51:45.353
Absolutely brilliant,
the humor and the timing.

51:45.352 --> 51:48.196
It was that rhythm that he got.

51:48.189 --> 51:54.037
I would call it, it was so working class,
ordinary Joe American.

51:54.028 --> 51:56.030
It was perfect!

51:56.781 --> 51:58.499
Why did you stop writing?

52:00.159 --> 52:01.581
I don't know.

52:01.577 --> 52:04.922
OK, I have several scripts here.

52:04.914 --> 52:06.507
This is...

52:07.124 --> 52:09.843
"ROCk'n'ROll Killer",

52:09.835 --> 52:12.384
"Help, there's a spy in my bed",

52:12.380 --> 52:16.305
"Rancho Bikini",
"The Assassination"...

52:16.842 --> 52:18.560
Did you ever think you would go back?

52:18.552 --> 52:21.271
Yeah, continuously.

52:21.263 --> 52:24.608
But each time I did,
something else would come up.

52:24.600 --> 52:29.322
Usually my projects, whatever they were,
were always interfered with pictures.

52:29.688 --> 52:30.985
They came first.

52:30.981 --> 52:36.579
I would think that there was more
satisfaction and enjoyment to be had,

52:36.570 --> 52:40.165
if you were as good an actor
as Dick Miller

52:40.157 --> 52:43.206
to do that. Rather than sit
and sweat by yourself

52:43.202 --> 52:46.752
and have your work torn up
by other people.

52:48.082 --> 52:51.928
Paul Bartel is a friend of mine and he made
"Death Race 2000" which was a huge hit.

52:51.919 --> 52:54.342
And he did this picture
"Cannonball",

52:54.338 --> 52:56.386
which was based on a
cross-country road race,

52:56.382 --> 52:59.636
made for an independent producer named
Sam Gelfman and Run Run Shaw.

52:59.635 --> 53:01.854
<i>- They're doing it again.
- They're in for a surprise.</i>

53:01.845 --> 53:04.519
<i>If they're racing anywhere,
they're gonna race to the impound lot.</i>

53:04.515 --> 53:06.233
<i>Get me the Highway Patrol!</i>

53:07.643 --> 53:09.645
Paul was viciously unhappy.

53:11.939 --> 53:15.569
He thought: "Oh God, I have to work
with cars for the rest of my life."

53:17.528 --> 53:19.246
<i>You're the outlaw racer!</i>

53:19.989 --> 53:23.744
<i>Geez, it's a real pleasure,
Mr. Cannonball, a real pleasure.</i>

53:25.202 --> 53:27.921
Allan and I were pursuaded

53:27.913 --> 53:29.915
to appear as actors in the movie.

53:29.915 --> 53:32.543
<i>If Cannonball Buckman wins
a Trans-American Grand Prix</i>

53:32.543 --> 53:35.672
<i>in our car, we're gonna be
two heavy dudes.</i>

53:35.671 --> 53:38.424
Dick had a part as
David Carradine's brother.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.597
<i>Hey Bennie, where you been?
I thought you weren't gonna show up.</i>

53:40.592 --> 53:41.935
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

53:41.927 --> 53:44.396
<i>You think I'm gonna miss my kid brothers
first big race after he got out?</i>

53:44.388 --> 53:46.356
Dick is really good in this movie.

53:46.348 --> 53:49.272
It's actually one of the best
performances I think he ever gave.

53:49.268 --> 53:50.815
<i>This is important to me.</i>

53:50.811 --> 53:52.779
<i>It's not just the money,
my life is on the line.</i>

53:52.771 --> 53:54.773
And I was privileged
to look at the dailies.

53:54.773 --> 53:58.494
I was just really impressed with Dick,
at how good he was in this part.

53:58.485 --> 54:01.534
And I thought, you know, this guy
doesn't get enough big parts.

54:01.530 --> 54:04.704
Joe says to me:
"You and I did a picture together."

54:04.700 --> 54:07.203
If you don't start with Roger
I don't know where you end up?

54:07.202 --> 54:11.673
I thought Joe was either
a production assistant

54:11.665 --> 54:14.214
or a producer,
I wasn't quite clear.

54:14.210 --> 54:16.178
And Dick was in that movie as well.

54:16.170 --> 54:19.470
I think we may have met during
the screening of it.

54:19.465 --> 54:23.015
I'd say: "Hey, Dick!" - I don't think
he knew who I was frankly.

54:24.261 --> 54:27.481
I think I may have known Allan
when I was in New York.

54:27.472 --> 54:29.349
We formed a very close
working relationship

54:29.349 --> 54:31.898
to the point that we first got
a chance to do a movie

54:31.894 --> 54:35.319
It was the trailer department's movie
basically, "Hollywood Boulevard"

54:35.314 --> 54:39.911
which was made up of sequences from a zillion
other pictures that we had done trailers for.

54:39.902 --> 54:42.781
<i>Hollywood Boulevard, the street
where starlets are made.</i>

54:42.780 --> 54:44.703
<i>On Monday, Candy came to Hollywood.</i>

54:44.698 --> 54:46.666
<i>On Tuesday, she lost her blouse!</i>

54:46.659 --> 54:49.333
<i>On Thursday, she massacred
three hundred rebel soldiers.</i>

54:49.328 --> 54:52.457
You know, there they were
and they were the directors.

54:52.456 --> 54:55.460
And we were told that they were a team

54:55.459 --> 54:58.588
and we were told that this was
a spoof on a Corman movie.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.136
I don't think they told Corman that.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.259
<i>You fucking fly!</i>

55:04.051 --> 55:06.099
I kept seeing Dick Miller everywhere.

55:06.095 --> 55:09.690
I saw him in "Big Bad Mama", in all the
"Nurses" movies that he was in.

55:09.682 --> 55:13.482
He was just a friend of Roger's who kept
getting hired over and over again.

55:13.477 --> 55:16.777
I guess I met him and worked
with him on "Hollywood Boulevard".

55:16.772 --> 55:19.616
I may have met him in
passing before that,

55:19.608 --> 55:23.408
but "Hollywood Boulevard",
where he plays Walter Paisley,

55:23.404 --> 55:24.906
that's where I spent time with him.

55:24.905 --> 55:27.203
<i>It's a nudie picture with
a two thousand dollar budget.</i>

55:27.199 --> 55:28.951
<i>No script, a ten-hour
shooting schedule</i>

55:28.951 --> 55:32.296
<i>and it opens in 22 cities at the end
of the week. You want it or don't ya?</i>

55:32.287 --> 55:33.960
I was signed to do this part.

55:33.956 --> 55:37.256
And the character was named something
or the other and the guys said:

55:37.251 --> 55:41.176
"We change the name to Walter Paisley."
I said: "That's the same name!"

55:41.171 --> 55:43.173
<i>What did you want to talk
to me about, Walter?</i>

55:43.173 --> 55:46.723
I believe Joe Dante said:
"Yeah, let's use it. Inside gag."

55:46.718 --> 55:50.018
And that seemed to be a good idea.
It's not the same character.

55:50.013 --> 55:53.813
People say that's the same character.
No, it's not the same character.

55:53.809 --> 55:55.231
Just the name is the same.

55:55.227 --> 55:59.323
So I think it was out of
the Walter Paisley role

55:59.314 --> 56:03.660
that most of the affection these young
film makers had for Dick Miller came.

56:03.652 --> 56:08.123
You know, and we saw ourselves as giving a
leg-up to the Walter Paisley's of the world.

56:09.950 --> 56:13.955
They were so busy doing things
that they'd never done before like

56:13.954 --> 56:16.002
you know, looking at sunlight,

56:15.998 --> 56:19.969
that they didn't pay any attention to me,
and Paul and I have a habit of ad-libbing.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.383
<i>- Your money or your life.
- No, feeling, Mary,</i>

56:22.379 --> 56:24.222
<i>your money or your life.</i>

56:24.214 --> 56:26.216
<i>- Terrible, Mary.
- Your money or your life!</i>

56:26.216 --> 56:28.685
<i>- Magnificent! Wonderful!
- Eric, Eric!</i>

56:28.677 --> 56:30.850
The first time I saw Dick Miller,

56:30.846 --> 56:33.395
was when we shot the big party scene

56:33.390 --> 56:36.189
which takes place at the end
of "Hollywood Boulevard".

56:36.602 --> 56:38.149
<i>You really handle that tray nice.</i>

56:38.145 --> 56:42.275
<i>Thank you. Actually, I'm not
a waiter, I'm a robot.</i>

56:42.274 --> 56:44.276
I was a production assistant,

56:44.276 --> 56:48.281
this was my first legitimate
Hollywood feature job.

56:48.280 --> 56:51.079
So I saw Dick Miler in a scene
with Robby The Robot.

56:51.075 --> 56:53.077
<i>500 a piece, be reasonable.</i>

56:53.076 --> 56:55.499
<i>Say man, who you tryin' to jive?</i>

56:55.496 --> 56:58.340
There was a period in the 70s where he
was wearing a pink jacket all the time.

56:58.332 --> 57:00.755
So clearly he's bringing his own
clothing to the movie.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.755
"It's the guy with the pink jacket!"
But I don't know if that would really help.

57:05.923 --> 57:08.972
<i>Hi there. I'm Joe Littman
and welcome to Guess Word.</i>

57:08.967 --> 57:12.312
We had him for a clay.
His wardrobe was a sports jacket,

57:12.304 --> 57:16.354
a pink one that I guess he owned.
This is how he showed up.

57:16.350 --> 57:19.695
<i>Number 7, Karen, that's really
very good for your first spin.</i>

57:19.687 --> 57:23.408
<i>Hi Joe, ready for the question
behind the Magic Hole Board?</i>

57:23.399 --> 57:24.946
<i>We certainly are.</i>

57:24.942 --> 57:28.162
This has been in about ten pictures.

57:28.153 --> 57:31.498
Ancd there was a wit there.
There was an intrinsic wit.

57:31.490 --> 57:33.492
And probably still is.

57:33.492 --> 57:36.166
That says
"Death Before Dishoner."

57:36.662 --> 57:40.712
Oh, I didn't have
"Death Before Dishoner" put on it.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.426
I figured, it's too much to pay.

57:44.419 --> 57:45.887
<i>Those Ramones are peculiar.</i>

57:45.879 --> 57:49.725
<i>They're ugly, ugly, ugly people.</i>

57:49.716 --> 57:52.060
- Did you ad-lib your line?
- Yes.

57:52.052 --> 57:54.020
I had a long speech there.

57:54.012 --> 57:57.482
About "Where are they" and something,
I forget what it was.

57:57.474 --> 58:00.148
But I looked at these guys and thought

58:00.143 --> 58:01.861
they're ugly people.

58:02.646 --> 58:05.115
That's funny.
I'm sure he ad-Iibbed it.

58:07.776 --> 58:10.199
And I was actually there the night
they blew up the high school.

58:10.195 --> 58:13.495
And Dick was there of course,
and Mary Woronov and everybody.

58:13.490 --> 58:16.243
That's probably the first time
I met Dick, actually.

58:16.243 --> 58:19.087
It was like 2:00 in the morning
in South Central LA.

58:19.079 --> 58:20.752
They gave me the uniform and said:

58:20.748 --> 58:23.797
"Leave your jacket off until
we're ready to shoot."

58:23.792 --> 58:25.920
I said, why?
They said: "You may get killed."

58:25.919 --> 58:28.388
Whenever there's a part
that I can fit Dick in,

58:28.380 --> 58:30.132
I try and find a place for him.

58:30.132 --> 58:33.261
You know, "Piranha"
was written by John Sayles

58:33.260 --> 58:36.890
and he was stuck in the role
of Buck Gardner.

58:36.889 --> 58:39.358
There were two pictures:
"Rock'n'Roll High School" and "Piranha".

58:39.349 --> 58:42.148
"Rock'n'Roll High School" was a much
more interesting subject I thought,

58:42.144 --> 58:44.943
but Allan had been living his whole
life waiting to do this picture.

58:44.938 --> 58:47.691
So he got that one and I got "Piranha".
The fish story.

58:47.983 --> 58:50.953
<i>- Excuse me, I'm on the phone.
- But the piranhas.</i>

58:50.944 --> 58:52.537
<i>I thought I told you not to even
say that word!</i>

58:52.529 --> 58:55.248
<i>- But the piranhas.
- What about the Goddamn piranhas?</i>

58:55.240 --> 58:57.083
<i>They're eating the guests, sir.</i>

58:58.285 --> 59:01.129
And I just remember
Dick playing this guy

59:01.121 --> 59:03.249
who's trying to run the whole show

59:03.248 --> 59:06.252
and the stupid piranhas come
and start eating the guests

59:06.251 --> 59:08.504
and mess up all his plans.

59:08.504 --> 59:10.632
I met Dick in Austin, Texas,

59:10.631 --> 59:12.850
when they were filming the big
scene in "Piranha".

59:12.841 --> 59:15.765
Joe said: "You gotta watch this guy,
he's just great."

59:15.760 --> 59:19.105
<i>Look, I want all incoming calls
switched directly to me.</i>

59:19.097 --> 59:21.725
<i>I blew that. I know it.
It stinks</i>

59:21.725 --> 59:24.979
He's so fast and he's so furious
and he's so delicious.

59:24.978 --> 59:28.107
In a lot of his roles he has
something like that,

59:28.106 --> 59:30.700
which is basically a straight
part in a way.

59:30.692 --> 59:33.491
But he understands the tone
of the movie

59:33.487 --> 59:36.991
and so it ends up being very funny.
He doesn't have punch lines per se,

59:36.990 --> 59:39.243
but it ends up being a
funny performance.

59:39.785 --> 59:41.287
<i>Schmuck.</i>

59:41.286 --> 59:42.663
Joe was a great mentor to me.

59:42.663 --> 59:45.257
I noticed that both of us
and some of our friends

59:45.248 --> 59:47.296
like Jon Davison, Allan Arkush,

59:47.292 --> 59:50.922
also loved genre pictures.
And Dick was right there.

59:50.921 --> 59:53.015
<i>Piranhas! Jeez.</i>

59:53.006 --> 59:57.432
Dick made the movies that we were watching
that were driving us insane with delight.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:01.728
Actually, all of these kids
that came up with Roger Corman,

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:05.023
when they grew beyond that
and when to the studio level,

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:08.363
they gave Dick his third career.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:15.954
Well, the thing most people don't know,
certainly I didn't know when I started,

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:20.452
was that there are this many of us
and that many jobs.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:24.667
Everyone one of those jobs
is politically given.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:27.132
You don't have a batting average,
you can't walk in

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:30.128
and say: "Look I bat three-fifty,
put me in the line-up."

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.755
No, no, no. Somebody
who likes you gotta say

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:38.136
"Dick Miller is the right guy for this one.
Or Bob Forster. We want him."

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.637
<i>We return now to Divorce Court.</i>

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:43.641
<i>Being sworn in is Jim Breen, testifying
on the behalf of Walter Higgins.</i>

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:47.645
<i>Well, Walter and me used to be partners
and friends for forty years now.</i>

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:51.236
I think maybe I first became
aware of Dick Miller at breakfast

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:53.654
There was a breakfast place
that I went to.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:58.872
And Dick Miller, if he wasn't working,
he was sitting there every single day.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:02.914
We all met at this place
about 10:30 in the morning.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:06.129
We had a pretty good group of people.

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.874
Robert Forster, Dick and I.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.876
Every day, he would eat the same thing.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:14.926
It would either be a scoop of tuna with
chopped up onions on it or egg salad.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.298
Harry was a part of the group.

01:01:16.298 --> 01:01:20.394
I know a lot of stories about him, I don't
know if he's told any of these stories?

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:22.638
There was a picture called
"White Dog".

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:26.437
They said Sam Fuller is gonna direct,
and I said: "Gee, I'd like to get on that."

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.151
Jon Davison was the producer.

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.272
He says: "You go down there,
the guy's got a monkey for you."

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:34.366
"He's your monkey, he's a nice little guy,
weighs about thirty pounds."

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:37.201
"In the event that he starts
to bite you..."

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:39.492
I said: "What?"
He says: "No, no, it's not bad."

01:01:39.487 --> 01:01:42.787
"He'll just nibble on you." I ain't gonna
work with no monkey that nibbles.

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:46.663
He says: "No, just listen to me,
it works. Bite the monkey."

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.335
<i>Up this road, on the right
is the arena.</i>

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:51.254
The monkey starts nibbling on me.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:54.753
I said: "Stop it! Cut that out!
Don't do that! Stop it!"

01:01:54.753 --> 01:01:56.847
The monkey looks up at me like that.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:02:00.012
I got it whipped. Leave it up to me,
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:03.228
"Alright, get ready for the retakes."
I said: "What retakes?"

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.315
He says: "Look at you,
the monkey peed all over you!"

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.435
We get into it, I changed my clothes
by the way.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.567
All of a sudden the monkey is biting
on my wrist, he's tearing me up.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:16.191
"Will you do what I say,
just bite the monkey."

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.489
"We're gonna do this scene once more,
go change your clothes."

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.659
I said: "What?!" The monkey,
you should pardon the expression,

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.623
crapped on me!

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.953
The monkey starts nibbling,
the guys in the background going:

01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:29.829
"Bite the monkey!"

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:32.670
And I bite the monkey on the neck.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.715
We finished the scene, the monkey
never laid a hand on me.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.678
I go outside to find Jon Davison.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:40.675
"You fixed me up good,
I got a monkey that pees on me,

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:44.679
that craps on me",
and he says: "The legend lives."

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:49.525
So, there's two things I learned
about this business.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.770
One: The legend which is me, lives.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:55.648
And two: Whenever you think
you know something,

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:59.618
there's always somebody who knows
a little bit more about it than you.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.452
Bite the monkey.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.868
Well, as the years went by

01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:06.583
and Dick took on this sort
of iconic status,

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:09.954
his mere presence sort of
became self-referential.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:13.674
And I think probably, the key person
responsible for this is Joe Dante

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:16.043
who put him in every one
of his pictures.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:17.965
<i>Please, you gonna purchase, purchase.</i>

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.088
<i>Now leave 'em alone,
you'll get 'em greasy.</i>

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:23.592
The first clay on "The Howling" was
when we did Dick's scene in the shop

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:25.265
where he has the silver bullets.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.809
And I just thought it was
a magical scene.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.398
<i>Your classic werewolf can change
shape any time it wants.</i>

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.939
<i>Whenever it takes a notion to 'em.
That's why they call 'em shape shifters.</i>

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.277
<i>I got a dozen books on it.</i>

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:38.649
I love the book store scene because
to me, this is like a packed scene.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:42.323
How to survive a packed scene,
that's a whole other issue.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:44.321
He's the perfect person to own

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.369
a store that sells curios
and odd ball things,

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.959
because he doesn't really believe
any of it. But he'll sell anything.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.921
<i>What am I, an idiot? I'm making a buck
here, you want books, I got books.</i>

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.664
I didn't write it specifically
for Dick,

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:58.635
but in Joe's mind it was a Dick Miller-type
guy and I know I can get Dick.

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:00.220
They say he steals every scene.

01:04:00.211 --> 01:04:04.011
<i>The Manson people used to hang around
here and shoplift. Bunch of deadbeats.</i>

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:07.637
So I think it's a good thing it was
only one scene we had together.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:10.606
I have no idea how much of
the dialog is John Sayles

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.020
or how much of it is
embroidered by Dick.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:17.647
You just know that no one can pack
3O seconds with as many words as he can.

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:20.946
<i>I take Bank of America, American Express,
Visa. You gonna buy that or what?</i>

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:24.991
In the early 1980s,
Joe Dante was a guy

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:27.455
that we really looked up to.
And I think that during the 80s,

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:31.042
particularly the Spielberg years
where everything was sort of sweet

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.628
and then Joe came in there
particularly with "Gremlins".

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.920
He just really took that archetype
and really twisted it.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:40.795
When I first saw "Gremlins",
the movie,

01:04:40.794 --> 01:04:44.094
Phoebe and I, I think we were both like
"What did we just see?"

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:49.602
You never know whats gonna
hit and whats not,

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:53.019
you never know whats gonna be a
success in this business and whats not,

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:56.484
what will have sustainability and a life
after and all that sort of thing.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:57.728
With "Gremlins", we knew.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:01.152
All of "Gremlins" for me
was madness.

01:05:01.148 --> 01:05:04.027
We had a tremendous amount
of technical challenges on stuff

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:06.778
that I had never clone before.

01:05:06.778 --> 01:05:08.997
The puppet part was really,
really hard.

01:05:08.989 --> 01:05:10.957
It was a nightmare working
with these puppets.

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:12.951
Everything about it was insane.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.045
Everything about it was wrong.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:18.631
Just staring at these puppets,

01:05:18.623 --> 01:05:22.594
that was the most tedious,

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.007
boring!

01:05:24.004 --> 01:05:27.258
Vile footage I have ever lived with.

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:31.228
On an hourly basis, I just kept
questioning my sanity

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:33.187
for taking the project
in the first place.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:38.644
If ever there was a movie that
brought the "Wizard of Oz" vibe

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:40.190
to a movie, it was "Gremlins".

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:43.656
It was a Christmas movie.
It had a wicked witch.

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:45.195
<i>Deposit it this to my account.</i>

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.818
And there was Dick Miller.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:53.205
There was someone who anchored
the movie in our childhood nostalgia.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:54.917
<i>WW II</i>

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:56.582
When we made"Gremlins",

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:59.627
I didn't know there were any
difficulties at all making this.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.216
<i>See that plow?</i>

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.756
<i>Fifteen years old, hasn't given me
a days trouble in fifteen years.</i>

01:06:03.752 --> 01:06:05.425
<i>You know Why?
Kentucky Harvester.</i>

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.889
I think I was brought in

01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:11.636
and they just said: "Hello, we'd love
to have you in our picture."

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.888
<i>You have the thingy.</i>

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.640
Jackie Joseph was my wife
in so many things,

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.733
I thought I was married to her.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.817
Knowing I was working with Dick,

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:26.737
I think these wonderful producers
and director just thought

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:30.783
wouldn't it be funny to work with those
people from "Little Shop of Horrors".

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.748
<i>Murray, did you hear from
the noodle factory?</i>

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:37.290
<i>Sheila, the noodle factory
is not gonna re-open.</i>

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:41.131
I really like The Futtermans.
They're totally believable.

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.591
And limited as they are,
I understand them.

01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.177
Are you at all like Murray Futterman?

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:50.640
No. Murray Futterman is a man
who makes mistakes.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.761
Errors. I'm perfect.

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.264
But he's a guy who's set in his ways.

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:00.900
Well, maybe.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:03.778
I'm set in some ways.
What?

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.523
See, the dog knows.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.275
The critical reaction was
surprisingly good.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.823
I mean, it really put me on the map.
Suddenly I was like this person

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:13.493
who made a movie that got pretty
good reviews because it was weird

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:15.365
and also made a lot of money.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:18.084
So it was like,
OK, put him on that list.

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:20.875
I stayed on that list until my
next picture came out.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.622
Then I went off that list.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:28.754
- <i>Look out! Behind you!
- It came out of the screen!</i>

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:33.259
What I see in his films is this
quality that I call density.

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:36.102
It's different from a lot of
people's work.

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:40.144
One of the things about Joe Dante's
movies that's pretty consistent

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:45.237
is that his movies are all love
letters to movies.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.273
I don't know,
somehow he just manages

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:53.153
to capture the love of and the fun
of these genre movies

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.995
in a way that nobody else really can.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:59.084
One of my favorite my favorite Dick Miller
scenes in the Joe Dante oeuvre

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.999
is his scene in "Explorers".

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:04.248
<i>Look man, I've been having
dreams about this lately.</i>

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:06.421
<i>Yes, really.</i>

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.253
<i>The weird thing is,</i>

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.797
<i>I haven't had dreams like this
since I was a kid.</i>

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:16.346
You know, he's the helicopter pilot
and when he discovers

01:08:16.343 --> 01:08:18.937
what the kids have done
and you get the sense

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:22.353
that this was a childhood dream
of his that they have realized.

01:08:22.348 --> 01:08:25.227
In all of his movies that center
on young characters,

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:27.319
there's always a feeling

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:30.907
that the movie is also gratifying
for an adult looking back

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:34.198
and remembering that part
of their own life.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.953
<i>No way Wednesday night;
I'm on a league.</i>

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.951
<i>This seminar can change
your life, Vic.</i>

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:44.295
<i>The man is a great healer.</i>

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:45.755
<i>And I'm a great bowler.</i>

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.751
There was a lot of ad-libbing
in "The Burbs".

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:51.048
Joe would just let the camera
keep running

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.923
and when the actors finished
their scripted lines,

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.469
they would just kind of go.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:59.640
It had a wonderful cast with
Tom Hanks and Carrie Fischer

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:03.435
and then the scene with Dick
was just hilarious.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.183
<i>What the hell is wrong
with these people?</i>

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.776
<i>He has a right to know, Vic.</i>

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:08.520
<i>Don't start up with me!</i>

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:13.026
It was the type of scene where he
could control the situation.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:17.370
I think Joe Dante gave him a lot of
leeway as to how he would go with it.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.956
When I first met Dick, I really
didn't know anything about him

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:23.872
other than that he was an actor
that Joe really loved to work with.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.121
The irony is, for all the movies
that we're together,

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.715
we really only share the screen
in "The Burbs" .

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:32.086
<i>Look, I don't Want to hear
any of your bullshit either.</i>

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.759
<i>The question here is garbage,
and who cleans up this mess!</i>

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:38.930
I was pretty reckless by that point.
I know that I smoked weed on the set.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:42.930
I remember being in my trailer and I
was friends with Sam Kinison, the comedian.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.773
I'd open the door and there would
just be weed bellowing out of it.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.233
He was a smart ass kid.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.398
<i>What else could you do
with those whose?</i>

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:52.273
<i>Shut the fuck up kid,
we're trying to do some acting.</i>

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:54.569
I don't have a problem.
I'm good.

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:56.660
I'm fine, what are you talking about?

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:59.700
It was shot during a writer's strike,
so I decided

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:01.664
that we would shoot it on the
Universal backlot

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:04.125
where it would be a little stylized
and wouldn't look too real.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.419
And that we could shoot in sequence.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.005
And then if people wanted to improv,
that it would be OK

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:12.217
because we wouldn't be affecting the ending
because we'd be doing it in sequence.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.631
<i>All of you, go to hell!</i>

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:20.050
It's odd, but that picture got the worst
reviews of any picture I ever did.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.768
Yet, I'd go to dentists offices
and people would say

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.309
"You made the The Burbs?
Oh, I love that movie."

01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:29.230
<i>They're playing this thing on Saturday,
unless you people stop them.</i>

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.977
<i>Ask the people that run this theater.</i>

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.821
<i>Ask 'em why they're sailing this
town's kids - your kids...</i>

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:36.532
I think my favorite Dick Miller role,

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:40.074
of the movies I've worked on
was in "Matinee".

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:43.285
<i>I'm Lawrence Woolsey,
who are you fellas?</i>

01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.909
<i>We're from Citizens for Decent
Entertainment, Mr. Woolsey.</i>

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.537
He was teamed up with John Sayles.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:51.380
I don't know, you'd have
to ask Joe about this.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:55.669
I think he was thinking that I'm
6 foot 4, and Dick's not.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.796
And they played the two hucksters

01:10:57.795 --> 01:11:01.595
that have been hired covertly
by Lawrence Woolsey

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:06.267
to drum up controversy
over Woolsey's movies.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.435
Well, this was a movie that
was close my heart

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:12.311
in that I was the age of the kids in the movie
when The Cuban Missile Crisis happened.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:18.946
And if you weren't there,
It’s hard to explain to people

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:21.035
how tense an atmosphere it was.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:29.628
I think of all the things that are
probably autobiographical for Joe

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:32.463
that's the moment.
I can see Joe as a kid,

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:35.925
watching these Corman movies,
and going home

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:39.763
and thumbing through his Famous
Monsters of Filmland Magazines

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:43.258
and figuring out
"Oh wait a minute! This guy!"

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:46.477
It may be, out of all the movies
that Dick Miller's been in,

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:50.975
I think that may be the only time
he actually played an actor.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.852
I think if you look back at all directors
and you look at their filmographies,

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:56.149
you see the same actors
popping up in all the movies.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.773
And so I did end up with a somewhat

01:11:58.773 --> 01:12:02.698
Preston Sturges-Ingmar Bergman-
John Ford-type group of people

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:05.789
that appear incessantly in my movies.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.499
Sometimes in smaller parts,
sometimes in big parts.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:11.540
The great thing about Dick is
that he comes from this tradition

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:15.541
where you can be memorable
in one scene in a movie,

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.635
or you can have the second
or third lead.

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.720
Either one is OK.

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:23.261
It's always a pleasure to work
with someone like that, editorially.

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:26.510
Because you don't have to look for
choices to make something work.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:28.182
He's just right there.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.768
<i>Lobby!</i>

01:12:33.141 --> 01:12:35.064
<i>Don't mess with
Murray Futterman.</i>

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:44.278
Many people who know Dick through
Roger and who know Dick through Joe,

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:48.498
call up and ask if Dick will be
in their movies.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:50.412
<i>- Hi, Walt.
- Well, well, well,</i>

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:53.127
<i>Detective Ray Cameron,
son of a gun. Is that really you?</i>

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.338
<i>Yeah, it's me alright, Walt.
How's about you?</i>

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:58.129
<i>Hey, can't complain.
Cannot complain, Raymond.</i>

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.842
I never considered anybody else.

01:12:59.834 --> 01:13:03.589
I wrote this police armorer character
and said, that's gonna be Dick Miller.

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:06.216
<i>Flamethrower? Flamethrower! ?</i>

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:09.389
<i>- Yeah!
- Flamethrower, Jesus.</i>

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.104
I think it plays to a general
audience, but it helps

01:13:12.096 --> 01:13:14.519
if you're a movie buff.

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:19.112
Most of the people who really love
this movie and revisit it,

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.071
particularly in the last couple of years,

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:23.487
know who he is and instantly see him.

01:13:23.483 --> 01:13:26.783
He generally gets a round of applause
just for being in the Goddamn thing.

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:28.779
<i>By the way, you gotta watch out
for this baby</i>

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.001
<i>Once you light the pilot, it goes out
and it plays hard to get like a son of a bitch.</i>

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:34.744
<i>You looking for somethin'?</i>

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:38.336
<i>Yeah, I wanted to use the phone.</i>

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:44.463
We had a cop car. We used to go out
on weekends with the cop car,

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.265
pull over crew members
who were driving drunk.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:52.262
Not because Dick wanted to be in character,
but just because it was hilarious.

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:57.984
Having someone like that on set
who you can ask questions to

01:13:57.975 --> 01:14:01.024
or they'll just give you a wink
and say "try that".

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.696
Because a lot of the time you don't want
to let actors tell you how to direct.

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:11.119
Once you open that door, they're all
over you with their suggestions.

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.831
Could you talk to us about some
of the TV episodes

01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:17.750
that Dick has directed?

01:14:17.745 --> 01:14:20.965
You know, IMDb has it wrong.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:25.925
He has not directed anything. There was
somebody with the same name who has.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:30.096
He hasn't directed anything on an
official basis, let me just put it that way.

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:32.389
- I forgot the name.
- It's dusty, Dick!

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.478
You remember him?

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.222
- Do I?
- Yes.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.101
I'm lucky I remember
who you are.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:43.989
Dick is a working actor.
That equalizes out to all of the films

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:46.574
that you may say here or there
are questionable choices.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:49.285
<i>Oh my God!</i>

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:52.075
He didn't like the way he died
in "Evil Toons".

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.914
He said it was very humiliating.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.120
<i>You clumsy son of a bitch!</i>

01:14:58.453 --> 01:15:01.081
<i>Look what ya did, I outta turn you
into scrap metal for this.</i>

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:05.460
Whenever any of these young directors
reference nostalgia,

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:07.086
they get Dick Miller.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:09.889
And "Chopping Mall" is no different.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.976
<i>Thank you, have a nice day.</i>

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:23.604
In the past few years we've been
doing a few of the conventions.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.033
Do you have fun going to
these conventions?

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:31.278
- Sometimes.
- Seeing your friends.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.620
What friends?

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:42.046
It's so funny because you have people
coming with kids in strollers:

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:47.090
"Remember, that's the guy that the
Gremlins ran over with the snow plow!

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:51.847
<i>You wouldn't happen to know of a place around
here where I can bed down for the night?</i>

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:53.637
<i>Well, it just so happens I do.</i>

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:57.058
That's one of my favorite parts,
was "Demon Knight".

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:03.352
I was extremely pleased
when he was cast in that movie,

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:06.355
because now was an opportunity

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:09.107
to work yet with a different
group of people.

01:16:09.106 --> 01:16:10.949
You know, the character of Uncle Willy...

01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:13.821
I'm trying to figure
who can I get to play this?

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:16.035
Can we get Dick Miller?

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:19.079
<i>Jeryline,</i>

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:21.624
<i>You wouldn't hurt your old Uncle Willy
now wouldya, baby?</i>

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:24.122
It was a movie that we did of
"Tales From the Crypt".

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:26.624
I think it was the first one that we did?
We were all worried about it

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:32.051
being a feature movie and if it would hold
up and Dick was one of our performers.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:33.514
It did very well.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.351
I found myself in a situation
to work with people

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:40.313
whose work I grew up with.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:44.275
Ernest Dickerson was very collaborative.
We worked very closely on the script.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:46.941
We worked very closely on the casting.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.189
I was next to him every clay,
shot by shot.

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:51.111
<i>Get that pussy off the table!</i>

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:57.405
The great secret it seems to me
to the craft of acting,

01:16:57.405 --> 01:17:00.625
is to work and work with the best
people that you can.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.914
It was just a really good ensemble

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.459
and they felt very much at ease
with each other.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:10.960
Whenever you kill an actor in a movie, you seem
to kind of know them a little differently.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.678
Yeah, he was a pain in the neck.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:15.048
We tried to cut off his head,
he wouldn't let us do it.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.633
<i>Oh man!</i>

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.760
So there was a lot of
togetherness on the set,

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:21.558
it was sort of like every scene
involved the whole group

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:24.603
running frightened by Billy Zane
and company.

01:17:24.599 --> 01:17:27.853
<i>You fuckin ho dunk, po dunk,
well-them-there mother fuckers!</i>

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:30.734
<i>Holy shit!</i>

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:35.069
<i>Hi, Uncle Willy.
Poor Uncle Willy.</i>

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.946
"Demon Knight", those ladies,
they didn't have any clothes on.

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:41.370
We shot seventeen
or eighteen takes on that.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:44.118
What else could Dick do?
I mean, really?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.917
It was kinda like a dairy farm.

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:51.217
You know, he's always been Dick.
I think it is his personality.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:55.258
- Who is that?
- That's my wife.

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:58.554
Lainie!
Lookin' at your picture!

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:01.849
No matter what role he plays,
who he is always comes out.

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:05.314
I was looking at his old school tats.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:08.276
I was asking him about it and he
talked about how he got them,

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.736
he was a sailor and he was young.

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.822
And he looked at me

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:15.236
and he said, really serious,

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:17.235
with a twinkle but serious:

01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:21.489
"If I ever find out that you
get a tattoo,

01:18:21.489 --> 01:18:23.366
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:26.210
Because what's cool at 20,

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.543
is an embarrassment at 50."

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.255
It is wisdom.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.423
When I met Dick,

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:39.515
I thought I'd get a whole bunch
of things from him,

01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:41.475
but I never really thought
about wisdom.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:44.721
You don't think about wisdom
with actors necessarily.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.267
<i>You don't have any ID.</i>

01:18:46.263 --> 01:18:47.890
<i>You don't have any money.</i>

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:50.860
<i>You're both dressed like clowns.
You figure it out.</i>

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:52.649
By the time I was running
"Deep Space",

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:55.148
I thought OK, I really wanted
something special.

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:58.572
We had this part of this camp guard

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:01.696
who could have been played
by a thirty-year old,

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:04.825
tall muscular guy.

01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:07.623
And I thought, no, no, no,
this is the part for Dick.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:10.872
<i>Now sit down, shut up,
fill out the forms</i>

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:13.340
<i>and if you have any problems,
don't come to me with them.</i>

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:17.303
The guy carrying this big-ass
futuristic rife,

01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:22.391
is not maybe your first thought
for a Dick Miller role.

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:24.511
But he plays it.

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:26.854
You know, you never question it.

01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:32.148
And I wish that more people had
cast him in that kind of thing,

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:37.694
because he just had chops
to do a wider range of parts.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:41.277
Dick used to go to "Theodore's"
for breakfast.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:46.659
Quentin Tarantino comes in,
he told Dick what a fan he was of his

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:49.831
and low and behold, the next clay
our phone rings at home

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:52.876
and they're calling for "Pulp Fiction".

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:57.343
He played Monster Joe.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:02.090
Monster Joe was a guy
who had a junkyard.

01:20:02.089 --> 01:20:06.094
But that's what he did
and that whole scene cut out.

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.392
<i>Tell you what.
If you ever need it,</i>

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.685
<i>I'll dispose of a body part for free.</i>

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:12.354
<i>How about an upgrade?</i>

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:14.397
"Pulp Fiction" got me a little bugged.

01:20:14.393 --> 01:20:19.024
If you make enough pictures,
you're gonna hit the stops in the road.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:22.576
Not that he hadn't been cut out
of things before.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:26.493
In an actor's life, I can't tell you how
many times the averages is

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:29.958
that somebody is that somebody gets cut
out of something that they've shot.

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.703
But, this was a big deal for him.

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:36.253
<i>I could take out an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Nah, I gotta run that past my account.</i>

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:44.303
"Cutaways" was a short

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:49.270
that is directed by a lady
named Agnieszka Kurant.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:52.811
She is actually an artist
and a sculptor.

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:56.186
But she wrote and directed this short

01:20:56.185 --> 01:21:00.110
about people who were
cut out of movies.

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:03.700
Abe Vigoda who was in
"The Conversation".

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.786
And Dick, with "Pulp Fiction".

01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:09.703
So, her premise in using these people,

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:12.918
is they meet somewhere again
in the Netherworld

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.921
and it's really quite interesting.

01:21:15.913 --> 01:21:17.961
You know, I didn't know
what to expect.

01:21:17.957 --> 01:21:21.507
It has been a long time since
"Pulp Fiction" came out.

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:25.973
And all of a sudden,
when the director yells "Action",

01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:30.436
all of the years peel off of Dick
and there he is again.

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:34.982
That's one of the great about Dick

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:38.695
is that he loves,
loves being an actor.

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:40.654
If you're lucky enough,

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.490
and I say this about what I do
to a certain extent,

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:46.986
but if you can have a job,
or do something,

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:49.408
that's you're so committed to,
that you love so much,

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:54.252
I think that really is the most
important thing in life.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:57.921
There were so many years we would
have loved to have a vacation.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.166
We never could put the money
together to have a vacation.

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:02.464
We didn't even really have
a honeymoon

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:06.464
until he went to do
"The Long Ride Home".

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:10.014
And when I showed up,
we called that our honeymoon.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:12.637
Since then, things have changed.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:16.140
And we've gone to Hawaii
a number of times.

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.794
He's always so committed
to being an actor,

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.913
he's just so focused on being an actor.

01:22:38.913 --> 01:22:40.881
I wouldn't say it's an important
part of his life,

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:46.676
I would say being an actor, I guess.
Elaine and being an actor is his whole life.

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:50.265
And I think the two of them have
gotten along absolutely famously.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:53.636
I know that he regards her very highly
and I know she loves him,

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.637
I don't have any doubts about that.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:59.267
Because, although I was really not
in show business myself,

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:02.361
I worked in the film studios and getting
to know some of the people

01:23:02.353 --> 01:23:04.447
who were there all the time,

01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:06.440
I'm proud of the fact that he made it.

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.165
Every role is special.

01:23:15.157 --> 01:23:19.879
He just looks at each role,
that there is nothing else

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.623
and it doesn't matter if the picture
is a big picture,

01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:25.001
or if the picture is a small picture,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.970
whatever it is, and I think
that's his secret

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:31.135
because he gives everything,
his all.

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:34.476
I think, one of the words
he uses a lot that...

01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:39.520
I understand why he uses it but personally,
it's like a little bit of a knife to me.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:42.109
It goes: "Oh yeah, that was
a nice little part."

01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:45.480
"That was a nice little part."
That's what he says a lot.

01:23:45.479 --> 01:23:47.777
And I hate the 'little' of it, you know?

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:49.366
Dick did an "ER".

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:52.362
I don't know if you saw that clip,
that's one of his best too.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:57.166
<i>Mr. Ackerman, can't take you
outside to smoke marihuana.</i>

01:23:57.157 --> 01:24:00.832
<i>I'm probably not able
to inhale anyway.</i>

01:24:00.828 --> 01:24:04.253
"Now this thing, they're not gonna cut.
This is gonna be on the air, right?"

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:07.468
I said: "Yes, it's gonna be. You're damn
right it's gonna be on the air."

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:10.838
"Because she's in it!"
"Yeah, because she's in it"

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:14.308
If you're on screen for a very
short period of time,

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.679
you don't have a lot of time to establish
a character or any quirks,

01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:20.101
so you work in slightly bolder strokes.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:23.897
I think that's one of the things that a good
day player, a good character does.

01:24:23.893 --> 01:24:25.987
No matter what size of the part,

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:28.777
they embody the character
so much, you feel like

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:32.572
when the camera leaves that shop or
wherever you encountered that character,

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.536
the character is still there
doing business.

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:36.405
And you could have stayed

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:38.658
and that would have been an interesting
person to hang around with.

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.284
I've always been delighted

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:43.584
when guys who started
with me move on

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.674
and I'm proud of what Dick has done.

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:50.587
We love going on cruises
and traveling.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.805
We like to see new places.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:55.762
We like to meet new people.

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:59.353
We really love to meet up again
with old friends

01:24:59.345 --> 01:25:01.723
that we haven't seen for a long time.

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:04.854
We'll go anywhere to dance,

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:07.899
especially, if its got good music.

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:12.946
How do you like that?

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.236
Like what?

01:25:16.236 --> 01:25:18.614
Those boating things.
I could do that.

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.881
Dick is one of my treasured
friends and colleagues.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:31.548
I would think that my work over the years
wouldn't have been quite as much fun,

01:25:31.543 --> 01:25:33.671
for me or for the people who watch it,

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.638
if Dick wasn't involved.

01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:41.391
That's it, that's the end
of the picture.

01:25:42.930 --> 01:25:45.024
Unfortunately,
I think it's my last one,

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:47.234
I really do, I'm tired.

01:25:48.685 --> 01:25:50.232
It's time to retire.

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:51.981
- Dick, you got a phone call.
- Just a second.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.654
And I've had it.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.744
I don't think I'll do anymore,
that's the end of it.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.863
I'm through, really.

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:00.409
Hello?

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:03.913
Yeah, I'm available.
