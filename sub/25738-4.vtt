WEBVTT

00:14.285 --> 00:16.845
Unprofessional behaviour,
using the public forum

00:16.925 --> 00:18.685
of the Lawyer Of The Year Awards

00:18.765 --> 00:22.245
to call your colleagues
"a shower of shithouses".

00:22.325 --> 00:24.125
My partners, ladies and gentlemen.

00:24.205 --> 00:27.045
I move that we suspend Ken Thompson
from the firm

00:27.125 --> 00:28.525
for a period of one month.

00:28.605 --> 00:30.925
Imagine having to keep it
from your whole family

00:31.005 --> 00:33.205
-you've been suspended from work.
-Chief Ken!

00:33.285 --> 00:35.605
If you tell Lorna,
I won't be your friend any more.

00:35.685 --> 00:38.525
Chief Ken's been suspended from work
and he's been hiding it from Lorna

00:38.605 --> 00:40.645
-this whole time.
-What? Ken!

00:40.725 --> 00:42.445
Find somewhere else to spend the night.

00:49.285 --> 00:51.045
[shooting and zapping]

00:51.125 --> 00:53.005
[Dylan] Clear the runway,
it's an emergency!

00:53.765 --> 00:55.845
[Rachel] Dylan! Eurgh, you animal!

00:57.565 --> 00:59.925
Can we please put a lock
on that bathroom door?

01:00.005 --> 01:01.445
It's on your dad's to-do list.

01:01.805 --> 01:04.485
Along with being honest
to his wife of 25 years.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.485
[gunfire and groaning]

01:06.365 --> 01:08.125
Are you still making Dad
sleep at Steve's bar?

01:08.205 --> 01:10.485
Well, until he apologises.
Also, with your dad gone,

01:10.565 --> 01:12.165
I get the chance to blast a few Nazis.

01:13.285 --> 01:15.725
-Dad would love a bit of this.
-[snorts] No!

01:15.805 --> 01:18.165
He gets furious
at the historical inaccuracies.

01:18.765 --> 01:21.045
"World War II was won by strategy, Lorn,

01:21.125 --> 01:22.645
not one American with a bayonet."

01:23.285 --> 01:24.805
-Sniper!
-Got him!

01:24.885 --> 01:26.125
[groaning]

01:26.445 --> 01:28.525
I don't think Dad meant to lie
about being suspended, Mum.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.325
I think he was just too embarrassed
to tell you.

01:32.405 --> 01:35.285
-Like when he applied for Mastermind.
-[they laugh]

01:35.365 --> 01:38.685
"But then the handsome prince
slayed the evil dragon,

01:38.765 --> 01:40.405
and saved all the villagers!"

01:40.485 --> 01:42.325
Phew, that was tense!

01:42.405 --> 01:45.045
I think we both need a nappy changing
after that one. [chuckles]

01:45.125 --> 01:49.325
"And so the prince and his beautiful
princess lived happily ever after."

01:49.405 --> 01:50.405
And then...

01:51.885 --> 01:53.165
-That's the end.
-No.

01:53.245 --> 01:55.565
What? That can't be the end.

01:55.645 --> 01:57.285
What happens after happily ever after?

01:58.565 --> 02:01.485
Sid, hey, have you been
eating the pages again?

02:01.565 --> 02:05.125
Sid? You are such a bad
nephew-cousin!

02:05.485 --> 02:07.965
Dad probably had a better night's
sleep over there anyway.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.085
Yeah. Dylan was a bit noisy last night.

02:10.165 --> 02:11.885
-All that rutting.
-Mum!

02:11.965 --> 02:14.445
It's healthy, Rach. It means he likes her.

02:14.845 --> 02:16.245
Maybe we'll hear the pitter-patter

02:16.325 --> 02:17.685
-of tiny Dylans.
-Yeah.

02:19.805 --> 02:22.085
It's funny you should say that, actually,
Mum, because...

02:22.165 --> 02:24.445
-You're pregnant!
-Shh! Dale might hear.

02:24.525 --> 02:26.565
-You're pregnant! You're pregnant!
-Mum! Stop that!

02:28.085 --> 02:29.245
He doesn't know?

02:31.205 --> 02:34.405
Well, I'm probably not.
I'm only couple of weeks late, so...

02:34.485 --> 02:38.645
Sid, I know what comes next
for the prince and princess.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.805
I'm so excited to be a dad!

02:40.885 --> 02:43.365
I'm going to do all the things
I could never do with<i> my</i> dad.

02:43.445 --> 02:44.685
Like meet him!

02:45.965 --> 02:47.565
[whirring and drilling]

02:51.925 --> 02:53.005
[groans]

02:56.125 --> 02:57.245
Sausage...

03:05.365 --> 03:06.725
What the f... ?

03:08.205 --> 03:09.325
Steve?

03:09.885 --> 03:11.245
[shouting] Steve!

03:12.645 --> 03:14.885
Steve? Steve!

03:15.885 --> 03:17.765
[screaming] Steve!

03:18.405 --> 03:20.765
Yeah, yeah! [chuckles]

03:21.445 --> 03:25.085
Here's my little stud-muffin!
So, is she a keeper?

03:25.685 --> 03:27.445
Er... Well, she's a goer.

03:27.525 --> 03:29.645
Come on, Dylan, give me
a little bit more information.

03:29.725 --> 03:31.525
Er, she's not my usual type.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.085
-Do you like her?
-She's all right.

03:34.645 --> 03:36.205
Dylan, that's so romantic, love!

03:36.285 --> 03:38.325
Mum, I wouldn't get too excited.

03:38.405 --> 03:40.565
If you like her,
I'm sure I'll like her too.

03:41.405 --> 03:43.565
Oh! Hi, Lorna!

03:44.445 --> 03:46.685
Connie! Oh, hi!

03:47.965 --> 03:50.445
Dylan, no.
Have you got back with Zoe?

03:50.525 --> 03:52.685
-Not exactly.
-Oh, thank God!

03:52.765 --> 03:55.245
For a minute there, I thought
you'd made a terrible mistake.

04:00.725 --> 04:02.125
Well, I'm fine.

04:02.885 --> 04:06.125
I'm fine! I can't complain.
The weather's getting nice again.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.765
Where's Pepe? Why are you having sex
with my son?

04:07.845 --> 04:09.125
Mum, don't be a knob.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.605
I know this must be a shock,

04:10.685 --> 04:13.605
but we bumped into each other
last night and--

04:13.685 --> 04:16.485
It's lovely to see you, Connie.
Why are you having sex with my son?

04:16.565 --> 04:18.205
Please, God, you're using contraception.

04:18.285 --> 04:20.005
-Do we need to?
-Sometimes.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.805
I'm making tea now. Tea.

04:22.485 --> 04:24.084
Tea. Goodbye.

04:27.845 --> 04:29.325
You want some tea?

04:30.085 --> 04:31.525
I'm not thirsty.

04:32.165 --> 04:33.605
I'm hungry.

04:34.325 --> 04:35.445
Rach!

04:35.965 --> 04:39.205
It's Connie! Dylan's girlfriend is Connie!

04:39.285 --> 04:41.445
-Which Connie?
-Connie Connie.

04:41.525 --> 04:42.845
-Your friend Connie?
-Yes!

04:42.925 --> 04:44.365
Steve's ex-wife Connie?

04:44.445 --> 04:45.645
Yes, Connie!

04:45.725 --> 04:47.365
Dylan's ex-girlfriend's mum Connie?

04:47.445 --> 04:49.325
-Hi, Rach.
-Hi.

04:54.885 --> 04:57.645
-Do you mind?
-No, that's fine.

04:57.725 --> 05:00.245
Cheers, my love. Bye, Rach!

05:01.605 --> 05:04.525
<i>-That</i> Connie?
-Yes, that Connie.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.365
But she used to babysit him!

05:06.445 --> 05:08.965
Let's not judge. I mean, she's obviously
been through a rough time.

05:09.045 --> 05:10.925
And being married to Steve for years
is enough to drive anyone...

05:11.005 --> 05:13.565
-Into Dylan's bedroom?
-Oh, Christ.

05:14.245 --> 05:15.765
I haven't even hoovered in there.

05:15.845 --> 05:17.445
[door opens]

05:18.485 --> 05:20.605
-Oh! Hi.
-Hi.

05:20.685 --> 05:22.685
Um, don't go into our room,

05:22.765 --> 05:24.525
because there's no surprise
in there for you.

05:24.605 --> 05:25.525
OK.

05:27.605 --> 05:29.165
50 quid it's a sofa fort.

05:29.485 --> 05:32.365
[Connie] Dylan, ooh!
[she squeals with pleasure]

05:37.525 --> 05:40.525
-Why didn't they put a bloody door in?
-I don't know, Ken.

05:40.605 --> 05:43.325
Domestic construction is one of two skills
I haven't mastered.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.565
-The other one is whist.
-Steve, when are they coming back?

05:46.645 --> 05:49.445
It's supposed to be next week,
but I'll give them a ring now.

05:50.085 --> 05:51.685
In the meantime...

05:51.765 --> 05:53.365
try and enjoy yourself.

05:53.445 --> 05:57.805
Try... Try and enjoy myself?
Enjoy what? Suffocation?

05:58.525 --> 06:00.525
Well, some people say
it heightens sensitivity.

06:00.605 --> 06:03.365
-Just call the builders.
-Will do.

06:03.925 --> 06:06.565
If you get bored, there's a couple
of tinnies left back there.

06:06.645 --> 06:08.365
And a newish copy of<i> AutoTrader.</i>

06:08.445 --> 06:11.245
Steve, I'm actually
a bit funny about small spaces.

06:11.325 --> 06:12.525
Ken, it's quite a big space.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.685
It is small for me.

06:14.765 --> 06:17.365
Ken... I will not leave your side.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.365
I'll be your Greyfriars Bobby,

06:19.925 --> 06:21.325
Chewbacca to Han Solo.

06:21.405 --> 06:23.925
In both those cases, the other guy died.

06:24.565 --> 06:26.565
Let's be Jack and Rose from<i> Titanic.</i>

06:26.645 --> 06:29.285
Just call the bloody builders! Fuck it.

06:33.165 --> 06:36.765
Wow! I wouldn't know how
to even search for that online.

06:37.325 --> 06:38.965
Oh, there's a whole subreddit.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.405
Well, I fucking enjoyed it,
whatever it was.

06:42.085 --> 06:44.005
I don't know what Zoe
was complaining about.

06:44.085 --> 06:45.685
Zoe complained about me?

06:45.765 --> 06:48.405
Oh, not about you... just about the sex.

06:48.485 --> 06:50.805
But Mum knows best.

06:53.365 --> 06:57.805
Dylan... I know we said this was
just supposed a bit of fun,

06:57.885 --> 06:59.365
but it's sort of working, right?

06:59.445 --> 07:01.325
Yeah! I beat my record.

07:04.765 --> 07:07.165
-What you doing?
-Putting a picture on Facebook.

07:07.245 --> 07:10.325
"Chilling with my bae.
Hashtag pinot, hashtag what am I like?"

07:10.405 --> 07:12.725
-Hey, hold on...
-There! We're official.

07:13.325 --> 07:15.085
God, that feels liberating.

07:21.765 --> 07:23.845
Er... breakfast in bed?

07:23.925 --> 07:26.925
God. None of my ex-husbands
ever brought me breakfast in bed.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.805
Well, Steve brought Weetabix once,

07:29.885 --> 07:31.125
but not to eat.

07:32.005 --> 07:33.365
[phone beeps]

07:33.765 --> 07:35.205
Oh! Our first like.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.205
From Zoe!

07:45.525 --> 07:47.285
Holy shit!

07:47.925 --> 07:51.965
I didn't want to get involved, but did
you think things were moving a bit fast?

07:52.045 --> 07:53.565
I just saw this on Facebook...

07:53.645 --> 07:55.205
Why did you like it?

07:55.285 --> 07:57.645
Oh, I like everything my son does
on Facebook.

07:57.725 --> 07:59.445
Well, ignore it. It's over.

08:00.245 --> 08:01.205
That was quick.

08:01.285 --> 08:03.765
Yeah. So quick that
she doesn't even know about it yet.

08:03.845 --> 08:07.205
-Dylan?
-Mum, could you do me a small favour,

08:07.285 --> 08:08.445
seeing as she's your friend?

08:08.525 --> 08:10.005
Could you tell her that it's over too?

08:10.085 --> 08:11.445
-I forgot to mention it.
-What?

08:11.525 --> 08:13.125
No rush, I won't be back
for a couple of hours.

08:13.205 --> 08:15.405
Oh, by the way,
she's expecting breakfast in bed.

08:15.485 --> 08:18.645
-Cheers, Mum. Bye!
-Dylan! Don't you dare! Come back here!

08:18.725 --> 08:21.325
Lorna? Is the shower free?

08:21.405 --> 08:23.485
-Yeah! Help yourself.
-Thanks.

08:31.605 --> 08:34.005
I can't believe
she actually kicked me out.

08:34.085 --> 08:36.165
I mean, all I did was lose my job,

08:36.245 --> 08:37.445
pretend to go to work

08:37.525 --> 08:39.965
and then lie about it to my wife's face
every day

08:40.044 --> 08:41.645
for the best part of a month.

08:41.725 --> 08:44.005
Well, bitches be crazy.

08:44.085 --> 08:46.325
They're not bitches, Steve, they're women.

08:46.845 --> 08:48.845
But, yes, broadly speaking,

08:48.924 --> 08:50.885
some of them be crazy.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.205
You wouldn't believe the mind games
Connie used to play.

08:53.285 --> 08:55.325
"Toilet seat down, Steve.

08:55.405 --> 08:58.285
Plastic sheets for skinning squirrels,
Steve."

08:58.365 --> 08:59.525
Skinning squirrels?

08:59.605 --> 09:02.485
You have to skin them, Ken,
or the fur bungs up the slow cooker.

09:02.565 --> 09:05.565
[sighs] You are a weird little creature,
Steve,

09:05.645 --> 09:07.845
but it's nice to have someone to talk to.

09:11.525 --> 09:12.885
[thud]

09:14.045 --> 09:16.085
Shh! Go, go! Go!

09:22.445 --> 09:24.485
It's really nice to talk to you too, Ken.

09:26.005 --> 09:27.125
Very nice.

09:29.085 --> 09:31.205
[she chuckles]

09:31.685 --> 09:32.925
Oh!

09:34.325 --> 09:36.965
Connie, can we have a little chat?

09:37.045 --> 09:39.405
I know what you're going to say, Lorn.
It's a rebound.

09:39.485 --> 09:43.205
Well, actually, a double rebound.
Not sure what you call that.

09:43.285 --> 09:44.685
Return volley?

09:44.765 --> 09:49.365
Listen, I really shouldn't be
the one telling you this, but...

09:49.445 --> 09:53.405
Can I just say how much it means to me
that you're OK with, er...

09:53.485 --> 09:54.605
You sleeping with my son?

09:54.685 --> 09:56.125
The last thing I need is any more drama.

09:56.205 --> 09:57.165
Drama? [laughs]

09:58.045 --> 09:59.485
No, no drama.

09:59.565 --> 10:02.405
I mean, it's not as if you're going to
become my daughter-in-law.

10:03.405 --> 10:05.925
-Is it?
-The year I've had, Lorn.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.005
Tearing the family apart
to run off with Pepe,

10:08.085 --> 10:10.045
then as soon as we get engaged,
Pepe gets drafted

10:10.125 --> 10:12.725
into the Israeli army and is never allowed
to contact me again!

10:13.845 --> 10:16.685
There comes a time, Lorn,
when you look at your life and you think,

10:17.125 --> 10:18.885
"Am I ever going to be happy again?"

10:19.565 --> 10:23.845
And then one Tuesday night in Walkabout,
up dances Dylan

10:23.925 --> 10:28.325
with a couple of tequilas and you think,
"Oh, why the fuck not?"

10:29.685 --> 10:31.805
I was in such a dark place.

10:31.885 --> 10:34.445
I can honestly say,
and this is no exaggeration,

10:34.525 --> 10:37.045
your son pulled me back from the brink.

10:38.285 --> 10:40.445
But I'm rabbiting on.
What was it you wanted to say?

10:41.005 --> 10:43.165
Oh... doesn't matter.

10:43.765 --> 10:45.325
It seemed very urgent a minute ago.

10:45.405 --> 10:46.685
And it's not now.

10:47.165 --> 10:48.645
Life's funny like that.

10:48.725 --> 10:50.685
No, spit it out, Lorn.

10:51.645 --> 10:52.565
Just...

10:53.765 --> 10:54.805
the thing is...

10:56.685 --> 10:58.165
Ken's left me.

10:58.845 --> 11:00.205
Really?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.685
Yeah, for an... air stewardess.

11:02.765 --> 11:05.085
Does a lot of travelling, then,
for his work?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.925
No. He met her in a taxi.

11:07.005 --> 11:09.165
-He met an air stewardess in a taxi?
-Yep.

11:09.245 --> 11:11.085
And now he's left me for her.

11:11.165 --> 11:13.885
-The... bitch.
-Oh, Lorna.

11:14.845 --> 11:17.005
-All men are shits.
-Yeah.

11:17.085 --> 11:20.285
Oh, sod the tea. Let's open some wine.

11:20.365 --> 11:22.205
Yeah, I think I need some.

11:24.165 --> 11:25.245
Wine!

11:26.045 --> 11:27.125
Woo! [laughs]

11:31.645 --> 11:34.125
-Dale!
-Whoa! Can't go in there.

11:34.205 --> 11:35.645
The prince hasn't finished yet!

11:35.725 --> 11:38.525
Prince? Dale, what's going on in there?

11:38.605 --> 11:40.485
You don't worry about that...

11:40.565 --> 11:41.725
baby. [chuckles]

11:41.805 --> 11:44.165
-Why do you say that?
-Say what?

11:44.245 --> 11:47.005
"Baby", in that weird way.
And then laugh.

11:47.085 --> 11:48.605
I can't keep it in any longer.

11:48.685 --> 11:49.765
Oh!

11:49.845 --> 11:52.125
-I'm so excited for us!
-OK, calm down.

11:52.205 --> 11:56.005
I just want to dance and sing
and shout from the rooftops.

11:56.085 --> 11:59.285
Rachel's pregnant!
[yelling] Rachel's pregnant!

11:59.365 --> 12:02.725
[electro pop music plays]

12:08.485 --> 12:10.285
-[music stops abruptly]
-Stop that.

12:10.365 --> 12:14.005
I don't know if I can! Rach, all that
corny stuff they say in movies, it's true!

12:14.085 --> 12:16.445
I feel like I'm made of clouds!

12:16.525 --> 12:17.645
Well, you're not.

12:17.725 --> 12:20.925
I don't know if I definitely am pregnant
yet. I still haven't done a test.

12:21.005 --> 12:22.165
Oh! I'll do one right now.

12:22.245 --> 12:24.885
Hey there, little guy.
Give me a high five.

12:25.605 --> 12:28.205
Yep! I felt him. We're pregnant.

12:28.285 --> 12:29.845
-OK, I'm not sure that's conclusive.
-Oh.

12:29.925 --> 12:32.205
-We need to do a real test.
-OK.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.485
OK, come on.

12:36.605 --> 12:40.165
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with D.

12:40.725 --> 12:43.005
-Well, it's not a bloody door, is it?
-So you concede?

12:43.085 --> 12:45.405
Well, given that I can't see anything
your side of the wall,

12:45.485 --> 12:47.125
yes, I concede.

12:47.205 --> 12:49.005
[chuckles] It's devotion.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.325
To my best friend Ken.

12:51.405 --> 12:52.565
God.

12:53.005 --> 12:54.645
I can't wait to go home.

12:54.725 --> 12:56.885
You're not going home, Ken.
Your marriage is in tatters.

12:56.965 --> 12:58.645
There's nothing wrong with my marriage.

12:59.485 --> 13:02.885
All we need is a weekend away in a B&B
and maybe a visit to a castle.

13:02.965 --> 13:06.245
That's what I thought with me and Connie,
but it's a sticking plaster.

13:06.765 --> 13:09.285
First it's the mini-breaks,
then before you know it,

13:09.365 --> 13:12.085
you're knocking on doors at Center Parcs
asking people to join in.

13:13.485 --> 13:15.085
Oh, God, that is bleak.

13:15.165 --> 13:17.045
Not as bleak
as when we first split up, Ken.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.045
[Ken sobs]

13:18.125 --> 13:20.645
Some mornings I would drink
a whole bottle of limoncello.

13:20.725 --> 13:23.125
Do you know what I needed most
in those darkest hours?

13:23.205 --> 13:24.605
A packet of Rennies?

13:24.685 --> 13:26.885
Bloody hell, I went through
so many Rennies, Ken.

13:27.485 --> 13:28.805
So many Rennies.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.845
No, I'm talking about... companionship.

13:32.925 --> 13:35.925
I don't mean the wishy-washy love
of a treacherous woman.

13:36.005 --> 13:39.925
I'm talking about real, male,
BFF companionship.

13:40.925 --> 13:42.405
And you were there for me, Ken.

13:42.485 --> 13:44.925
Was I? I don't think I was.

13:45.005 --> 13:48.085
We don't need women.
We need each other, forever.

13:49.725 --> 13:52.165
I'm putting my hand against the wall, Ken.

13:52.845 --> 13:55.085
It's about 1.61 metres from the floor.

13:55.165 --> 13:56.885
I suggest you do the same.

13:57.845 --> 13:59.165
[sighs despairingly]

14:00.925 --> 14:03.165
Do you know what a best friend
would do for me now?

14:03.245 --> 14:04.285
Sing you a lullaby?

14:04.365 --> 14:05.725
Go and see Lorna.

14:05.805 --> 14:07.965
Go and see Lorna and tell her I'm sorry,

14:08.045 --> 14:11.685
and that I'll be back as soon as
the bloody builders arrive.

14:12.645 --> 14:15.605
OK. Yeah, I'll do that right now, Ken.

14:16.885 --> 14:20.565
So I'm just going, Ken, to speak to Lorna,
like you asked.

14:21.405 --> 14:22.685
So, er...

14:24.085 --> 14:25.205
Bye.

14:25.885 --> 14:26.885
[clattering]

14:26.965 --> 14:29.565
Oh, my God, you are a weird little goblin.

14:29.645 --> 14:31.205
Which you'll come to love.

14:31.285 --> 14:32.445
Steve?

14:32.525 --> 14:33.645
Fuck.

14:35.605 --> 14:37.605
[dance music playing]

14:37.685 --> 14:39.445
You're better off
without him anyway, Lorn.

14:39.885 --> 14:41.725
He always was a funny-looking thing.

14:41.805 --> 14:44.405
What? Ken's bloody gorgeous.

14:44.485 --> 14:47.685
Oh, don't defend him, Lorn, not while
he's out there stowing his tray table

14:47.765 --> 14:50.645
and putting his seat-back
in the upright position.

14:50.725 --> 14:53.285
-What?!
-With the air stewardess.

14:53.365 --> 14:55.085
Right, forgot that.

14:55.965 --> 14:57.285
Yeah, screw him!

14:57.365 --> 14:59.165
You could do a lot better, Lorna.

15:00.245 --> 15:03.765
Maybe we should double date?
Me and Dylan, you and...

15:03.845 --> 15:06.645
-Listen, Connie...
-Hello, baby!

15:06.725 --> 15:07.725
Where have you been?

15:08.765 --> 15:09.885
Come and dance with me.

15:09.965 --> 15:13.205
Yeah, in a minute. Mum, quick word?

15:14.645 --> 15:16.005
[Connie squeals]

15:16.645 --> 15:17.925
What's she still doing here?

15:18.645 --> 15:21.645
I couldn't do it, Dylan. You should be
dumping your own girlfriends.

15:21.725 --> 15:23.565
-But she's<i> your</i> friend!
-Exactly!

15:23.645 --> 15:24.885
And I want to keep it that way,

15:24.965 --> 15:27.445
so you better grow a pair
and do the right thing,

15:27.525 --> 15:30.245
because I don't have much wine left
and I am not opening the good bottles.

15:30.325 --> 15:32.485
-Well, can't Dad dump her for me?
-No, he's left me.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.005
-Has he?
-No. Sorry, Dylly,

15:35.085 --> 15:37.085
I'm getting a bit mixed up.
I've had some wine.

15:37.685 --> 15:40.605
Look, let me teach you
how to properly dump a woman.

15:40.685 --> 15:42.845
First of all, be honest with her.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.245
[Connie squealing]

15:47.925 --> 15:50.765
So you mean, tell her
that she's absolutely fucking mental?

15:50.845 --> 15:52.125
No. Not that!

15:53.045 --> 15:55.685
Look, let me write it down for you.

15:55.765 --> 15:57.365
[Connie] Oh, yeah!

15:58.005 --> 15:59.845
Oh, my God.

16:03.325 --> 16:05.405
If it's a boy, we should definitely
call him Ken.

16:06.005 --> 16:07.205
And if it's a girl...

16:08.045 --> 16:09.045
Kenneth.

16:09.125 --> 16:12.445
I dunno, I was thinking something
more cool and Scandi.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.725
What's the name of the woman
from<i> The Killing?</i>

16:14.805 --> 16:15.805
Sarah.

16:16.965 --> 16:18.005
[both] No...

16:19.445 --> 16:21.165
God, it's crazy, isn't it?

16:21.245 --> 16:23.645
Just one drop of wee
will decide our entire future.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.005
Well, that is how
we got here in the first place.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.445
Dale, you do know it's not wee that... ?

16:28.525 --> 16:29.525
Whoa!

16:29.605 --> 16:32.005
Oh, it's a baby! [giggling]

16:32.405 --> 16:33.685
[he whispers] It's a baby.

16:34.165 --> 16:37.965
No, that line means it's negative.
I'm not pregnant.

16:43.565 --> 16:45.245
Are you OK?

16:46.565 --> 16:49.685
Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually kind of relieved.

16:49.765 --> 16:51.885
Kind of massively relieved.

16:53.085 --> 16:55.565
Oh, it's just hitting me now, actually.

16:55.645 --> 16:57.645
-Can you imagine us with a baby?
-Yeah!

16:57.725 --> 16:59.925
-And still living with my parents?
-No!

17:00.005 --> 17:03.685
Fucking hell, Dale, I think we've just
dodged a massive bullet here.

17:03.765 --> 17:04.725
Yeah!

17:04.805 --> 17:07.205
It's like I've been given a last-minute
pardon from the governor

17:07.285 --> 17:09.765
and he's not going to strap me to a chair
and inject me with motherhood.

17:09.844 --> 17:12.124
No! He's not.

17:12.205 --> 17:13.324
[both laugh awkwardly]

17:13.405 --> 17:15.445
What are we talking about?

17:19.445 --> 17:22.445
Three, two, one.

17:24.525 --> 17:27.165
Bad news, Ken. It's over.

17:27.245 --> 17:28.885
-What?
-She was like a woman possessed.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.685
Clothes all over the lawn,
your history books on fire,

17:31.765 --> 17:33.045
screaming that she never wanted to see

17:33.124 --> 17:34.765
your genetically perfect arse ever again.

17:35.325 --> 17:36.845
That doesn't sound like Lorna.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.285
-There was a man there too.
-A man?

17:40.245 --> 17:41.285
What man?

17:41.365 --> 17:44.125
Didn't catch his name.
But he was squeezing her bottom.

17:44.205 --> 17:45.605
What did he look like?

17:45.685 --> 17:48.685
Like Wolf from<i> Gladiators.</i> But stronger.

17:48.765 --> 17:51.045
Right, call Lorna.
I want to speak to her now.

17:51.125 --> 17:53.245
No, I think that would
just make matters worse.

17:53.325 --> 17:54.445
[yelling] Call her!

17:56.485 --> 17:57.805
OK.

18:00.005 --> 18:02.445
Lorna! Steve Chance.

18:02.525 --> 18:04.605
I've got Ken here, um...

18:05.525 --> 18:06.845
What?

18:06.925 --> 18:08.365
Whoa, slow down!

18:08.445 --> 18:10.045
Oh, she's angry, Ken.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.165
Tell her I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

18:12.245 --> 18:13.845
Ken says he's sorry.

18:15.005 --> 18:17.205
What? What? What?

18:17.285 --> 18:19.085
No, that's madness, Lorna!

18:19.165 --> 18:21.165
What's madness? What's madness?

18:21.245 --> 18:22.725
You're not going to believe this, Ken.

18:22.805 --> 18:24.685
She's saying you should move in with me.
Forever.

18:24.765 --> 18:26.445
Right, well, that's not going to happen.

18:26.525 --> 18:28.525
Well, I don't think
you've got much choice, Ken.

18:29.765 --> 18:32.685
What's that, Lorna? Ah, yeah.
She's reminding me I've got a hot tub

18:32.765 --> 18:34.125
which I often fill with stout.

18:34.205 --> 18:36.205
OK. Put her on speakerphone now!

18:36.285 --> 18:39.245
-No. No, I...
-[yelling] Put her on speakerphone!

18:41.045 --> 18:42.005
Fuck!

18:43.045 --> 18:45.685
[imitates Lorna's voice]
It's over, Ken, and I'm taking the kids!

18:46.805 --> 18:49.205
I could never love you the way Steve does!

18:49.805 --> 18:52.525
[in own voice] Don't be hard
on yourself, Lorna.

18:53.285 --> 18:54.485
[in Lorna's voice] No.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.205
No, it's true!

18:56.285 --> 18:58.965
He would make a much better partner
than I ever would.

18:59.045 --> 19:00.765
I don't mean sexually.

19:01.365 --> 19:03.765
First it would develop naturally...

19:03.845 --> 19:05.805
[Ken roars]

19:08.325 --> 19:10.245
Sorry, Ken. I got carried away.

19:10.325 --> 19:11.925
Did you even speak to Lorna?

19:12.005 --> 19:13.965
No. It's not my finest hour.

19:14.805 --> 19:15.805
Did you want to speak to her?

19:17.645 --> 19:19.485
-I'm going home.
-[Steve groans]

19:26.685 --> 19:27.965
He'll call you back.

19:29.445 --> 19:30.885
I'm so pleased you understand.

19:30.965 --> 19:33.205
I mean, when you think about it,
having a baby,

19:33.285 --> 19:35.045
I mean, that is a massive responsibility.

19:35.125 --> 19:37.525
Yeah, you're right.
And I wasn't prepared at all.

19:37.605 --> 19:40.605
I mean, all I've been doing for
the past two years is looking after Sid.

19:40.685 --> 19:41.805
Yeah.

19:43.405 --> 19:45.045
So how about this for a plan?

19:45.125 --> 19:46.245
We go back to normal,

19:46.325 --> 19:49.285
clock up some epic nights out
to use up all our FOMO,

19:49.365 --> 19:52.005
and we'll try for a baby some time
in the future, you know,

19:52.085 --> 19:53.605
when... when we're both ready.

19:54.205 --> 19:55.485
-Agreed.
-Yeah.

19:59.485 --> 20:01.045
So... tonight?

20:01.125 --> 20:03.085
-Tonight?
-Sorry.

20:03.165 --> 20:05.605
Yeah, my bad. Epic nights out first.

20:05.685 --> 20:07.645
I mean, it could be next year.

20:07.725 --> 20:09.445
-Or, you know, a few.
-Right.

20:09.525 --> 20:10.685
But within five.

20:10.765 --> 20:12.085
Let's just live our lives,

20:12.165 --> 20:15.765
be spontaneous
and it'll happen when we're ready.

20:16.605 --> 20:18.205
OK. Got it.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.885
I should probably take this down, then.

20:22.885 --> 20:25.205
Oh, my God. Dale.

20:26.645 --> 20:28.245
I am so sorry.

20:28.805 --> 20:31.565
-I had no idea you were this ready.
-Yeah.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.525
I was not this ready.

20:36.125 --> 20:38.285
And actually, this is a little intense.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.765
And this is my room

20:39.845 --> 20:41.805
and I have to sleep in here.
Where's my bed gone?

20:41.885 --> 20:44.125
Oh, my! This is so beautiful.

20:45.165 --> 20:47.085
-Does this mean that--
-I need some space.

20:49.245 --> 20:50.525
I should...

20:51.245 --> 20:53.085
Rachel, I'm sorry.

21:00.325 --> 21:04.925
Lorna, no offence,
but your son is a total shit.

21:05.005 --> 21:06.205
Just like his father.

21:06.285 --> 21:08.525
Oh, that's a shame. Did it not work out?

21:09.085 --> 21:11.085
Not only has he just dumped me,

21:11.165 --> 21:13.085
but it was the most pathetic dumping ever.

21:13.165 --> 21:17.085
Pathetic? Don't you mean
thoughtful and sensitive?

21:17.165 --> 21:19.125
No. I bloody don't!

21:19.205 --> 21:21.725
He said he wants to stay friends!

21:21.805 --> 21:23.685
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

21:23.765 --> 21:25.805
What do I want to be friends
with a teenager for?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.925
He's, like, seven!

21:28.005 --> 21:29.445
And the worst part of it is,

21:29.525 --> 21:31.525
he was reading it all
off a little bit of paper!

21:31.605 --> 21:34.365
Right, well, he wasn't supposed
to actually read it off the paper...

21:35.485 --> 21:36.885
Christ!

21:37.885 --> 21:42.125
Your family is toxic. I don't ever want to
see a Thompson man again.

21:43.285 --> 21:44.685
Connie, wait.

21:44.765 --> 21:47.445
Lorna, I... Connie?

21:48.765 --> 21:49.885
[yells]

21:49.965 --> 21:51.845
-Connie!
-One in the Thompsons!

21:51.925 --> 21:53.405
-[Ken groans]
-I'll go get some ice.

21:53.485 --> 21:54.685
Connie?

21:55.565 --> 21:57.165
-Steve.
-Connie.

21:58.325 --> 22:00.605
-Steve.
-Connie!

22:00.685 --> 22:02.125
[Lorna] Why did you have to
come back now?

22:02.205 --> 22:03.765
[groaning]

22:05.725 --> 22:08.125
-[Ken] Lorna!
-[Connie] Oh, I missed this!

22:08.205 --> 22:10.125
[Lorna] Here, shove this on them!

22:10.205 --> 22:11.845
Yeah. [groans in agony]

22:12.485 --> 22:14.245
-Oh Christ!
-Is it too hot?

22:15.245 --> 22:18.125
-[Lorna] Just there!
-[Ken] Why, Lorna, why?

22:19.525 --> 22:22.965
"...but then the handsome prince
slayed the evil dragon

22:23.045 --> 22:24.525
and saved all the villagers!

22:25.205 --> 22:29.205
And so the prince and his beautiful
princess lived happily ever after."

22:30.405 --> 22:34.205
Well, until the princess had a pregnancy
scare and needed some space.

22:35.325 --> 22:36.725
But don't worry, Sid.

22:37.205 --> 22:40.125
The handsome prince
knew exactly what to do.

22:43.845 --> 22:44.845
[Sid gurgles]
