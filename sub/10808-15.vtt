00:03.070 --> 00:06.062
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.958
(man humming softly)

01:12.506 --> 01:14.770
(soft humming continues)

01:24.418 --> 01:26.520
WOMAN:
Charlie?

01:26.520 --> 01:29.045
Charlie, I'm calling you!

01:31.325 --> 01:34.294
I'm not getting
a decent picture.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.964
Do you hear me, Charlie?

01:36.964 --> 01:40.200
I'm losing my eyesight
squinting at this thing.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.935
Clarissa Sanderson has

01:41.935 --> 01:47.274
a great big, brand-new
27-inch Zenith.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.909
Clarissa can change channels

01:48.909 --> 01:50.778
while she talks
on the damn phone.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.546
CHARLIE (quietly):
Mm-hmm...

01:52.546 --> 01:54.882
Mama always said
you'd never amount to anything.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.917
Did I listen to her?
Oh, no.

01:56.917 --> 02:00.521
"Charlie sells insurance.
Charlie has a future."

02:00.521 --> 02:03.590
Only, Charlie went and quit
his job 35 years ago,

02:03.590 --> 02:05.526
and look where we are today.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.760
(door opens)

02:06.760 --> 02:11.129
What is this piece ofjunk that
I found on my kitchen counter?

02:12.499 --> 02:16.036
Would you please look at me
when I am speaking to you?

02:16.036 --> 02:18.472
Oh, good, I need that.
Thank you, Ruth.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.708
I'm working on
a great new invention:

02:20.708 --> 02:22.776
a universal fastener.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.611
You see,
with a flick of a wrist,

02:24.611 --> 02:28.048
any door, drawer, or what have
you can be instantly secured.

02:28.048 --> 02:31.218
Needs no bolts,
screws or hinges.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.486
Can be applied to anything.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.922
And it's so simple,
even a child can use it.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.224
Charlie, wake up
and smell the coffee.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.826
Your inventions have
never worked,

02:38.826 --> 02:40.294
and they never will.

02:40.294 --> 02:43.931
All you're good for is
repairing broken-down junk.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.967
I want new things
that I can break myself.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.036
Something that comes
with a tag on it.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.404
Something that comes in a box.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.506
When was the last time
we had anything around here

02:52.506 --> 02:53.768
that came in a box?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.910
"Do not open this box."
Why?

02:56.910 --> 02:57.911
I don't know, dear,

02:57.911 --> 03:00.347
but we better leave
it alone; it's not mine.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.416
lt mu... it must've been
delivered by mistake.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.077
Give me the box.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.589
0h, Ruth, please,
there must be a reason why

03:08.589 --> 03:10.257
it says not to open it.

03:10.257 --> 03:12.392
0h, leave it alone, dear.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.528
It's only a box.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.130
You are pathetic.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.565
If Medicare wrote you
a letter ordering you

03:18.565 --> 03:20.328
to kill yourself, you'd do it.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.739
Oh, God,
I should've married Richmond.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.741
He wasn't afraid
to take chances.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.744
Dear, Richmond's been dead
for 20 years.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.447
Yes, and when he died,
he was a millionaire.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.982
And who got his money?

03:34.982 --> 03:36.683
Clarissa Sanderson.

03:36.683 --> 03:38.310
Don't you dare!

03:39.520 --> 03:41.722
Honey, there may be
a bomb in there.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.723
Shut up!

03:42.723 --> 03:44.190
(gasps)

03:50.130 --> 03:51.999
A piece ofjunk.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.125
(dog barks outside)

04:01.909 --> 04:03.243
Oh, good morning.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.244
CHARLIE:
Good morning.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.379
Excuse me.

04:05.379 --> 04:08.482
Um, is this the home
of Mister... Oh, dear...

04:08.482 --> 04:11.151
Oh, oh, Mr. Charles Pennywell?

04:11.151 --> 04:12.352
-Yes.
-Why?

04:12.352 --> 04:15.322
I'm afraid
I've lost something.

04:15.322 --> 04:17.191
It's of
considerable value to me,

04:17.191 --> 04:18.992
and it may have
been delivered

04:18.992 --> 04:20.527
to you by mistake.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.629
Uh, I, uh,

04:22.629 --> 04:25.699
you-you're certainly not on
my delivery list.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.901
But see, I have a nephew--

04:27.901 --> 04:30.170
uh, well, he's an
assistant, really, I...

04:30.170 --> 04:31.572
Well, he's not a bad sort,

04:31.572 --> 04:34.541
but, but young people
just can't...

04:34.541 --> 04:36.210
There's been a terrible mix-up.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.778
And I... Well, you have no...

04:37.778 --> 04:39.847
Well, anyway,
maybe you've seen it.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.582
It's a, it's a small box.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.683
It's about this...

04:42.683 --> 04:44.484
Oh! About this high.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.788
It has little brass
corners on it, and...

04:47.788 --> 04:51.892
and it has little letters
on it that say,

04:51.892 --> 04:55.095
"Do not open this box."

04:55.095 --> 04:58.265
Uh, you haven't seen it?

04:58.265 --> 05:00.534
Or have you?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.668
Maybe.

05:01.668 --> 05:05.239
Uh, well, l have
to deliver it this Friday.

05:05.239 --> 05:07.441
And you have no idea
the trouble I'll be into

05:07.441 --> 05:08.775
if I don't retrieve that box.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.844
Unopened, of course.
That goes without saying. I...

05:10.844 --> 05:12.012
I didn't mean to infer...

05:12.012 --> 05:14.681
Would you excuse us,
just for a minute?

05:14.681 --> 05:16.617
Certainly.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.719
-Don't you think...?
-Shh!

05:18.719 --> 05:19.853
Don't you think

05:19.853 --> 05:21.855
we ought to give him
his box back, Ruth?

05:21.855 --> 05:23.156
Certainly not!

05:23.156 --> 05:24.258
There must have been

05:24.258 --> 05:25.792
something very valuable
in that box.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.694
And somebody must have
stolen it.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.297
Now, we don't want him to know
that we even have it.

05:30.297 --> 05:33.133
You just let me handle this.

05:33.133 --> 05:37.537
Um, my husband thinks,
uh, that he, uh, may have,

05:37.537 --> 05:39.006
uh, seen your box.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.440
And I stress the word "may."

05:40.440 --> 05:43.110
Oh, good.
Very, very good!

05:43.110 --> 05:45.012
And, of course,
he would be happy

05:45.012 --> 05:47.581
to return it to you, uh,
if he could locate it.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.916
That's wonderful.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.550
-Ruth, we...
-Well, you see, but this is...

05:50.550 --> 05:52.152
my husband's busy season,

05:52.152 --> 05:55.289
and itjust might be
extremely, uh, inconvenient

05:55.289 --> 05:57.357
for him to take
the time right now

05:57.357 --> 05:59.426
to locate the box.

05:59.426 --> 06:02.429
And I thought, well, maybe,
if there were some, um--

06:02.429 --> 06:03.997
well, how shall I put that--

06:03.997 --> 06:06.199
-if there were some, um...
-Oh, Ruth.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.035
Reward?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.671
You-You feel
there should be a reward.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.139
-No!
-Yes.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.173
What?

06:13.173 --> 06:15.609
Yes, of course. Well...

06:15.609 --> 06:17.344
I'm a very fair man. I...

06:17.344 --> 06:20.580
I believe in payment rendered
for payment due.

06:20.580 --> 06:24.117
Uh, well...
and I must have that box back.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.253
Must, must, must.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.021
Unopened, of course.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.692
Of course, that goes
without saying, as I said, uh...

06:31.692 --> 06:36.830
Well, I'd...
I'd give anything.

06:36.830 --> 06:41.335
Absolutely anything.

06:41.335 --> 06:45.931
What exactly do you mean
by "anything"?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.375
(humming)

06:55.315 --> 06:57.818
RUTH:
Charlie?

06:57.818 --> 06:59.886
Charlie,
are you down there?

06:59.886 --> 07:03.190
Oh, my God, Charlie!

07:03.190 --> 07:04.558
It's almost 7:00.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.093
Here, put this on.

07:06.093 --> 07:10.831
Oh, the living room looks
absolutely gorgeous!

07:10.831 --> 07:13.533
Clarissa Sanderson is going
to have a hemorrhage

07:13.533 --> 07:15.569
when she sees this dress.
(chuckles)

07:15.569 --> 07:17.404
That's lovely, dear.

07:17.404 --> 07:20.140
0h, l've-l've-l've been
wondering about the color.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.342
Do-Do you think it's too limey?

07:22.342 --> 07:23.343
Charlie?

07:23.343 --> 07:24.478
No, it's lovely.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.013
-lt's great.
-Yes, dear.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.014
It is great.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.015
Oh!

07:28.015 --> 07:29.016
(dog barking outside)

07:29.016 --> 07:31.883
You're right. It's great.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.188
I look ten years younger.

07:35.188 --> 07:39.393
(gasps) 0h, Charlie,
who would have thought?

07:39.393 --> 07:41.528
Who would have thought?!

07:41.528 --> 07:42.629
Uh-huh.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.498
Oh, I can't wait

07:44.498 --> 07:46.767
to get my hands
on this basement.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.268
Dear, I'm really
quite comfortable

07:48.268 --> 07:49.970
down here, just the way it is.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.104
Oh, no.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.973
When he comes back,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.708
we are going to get him

07:54.708 --> 07:57.177
to change this
into a media center.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.946
We'll have
a big TV projection camera

07:59.946 --> 08:01.815
and lots
of stereo equipment...

08:01.815 --> 08:04.151
Don't you think we're being
a little bit greedy?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.519
I mean, after all,

08:05.519 --> 08:08.622
we haven't even given him
his box back yet, dear.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.524
Is that fair, Ruth?

08:10.524 --> 08:14.694
Charlie, there are two kinds
of people in this world.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.363
Now, lam a winner.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.265
I think you know what you are.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.466
Yes, dear.

08:19.466 --> 08:20.567
Charlie, please

08:20.567 --> 08:22.436
do not embarrass me tonight.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.204
This is my big night.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.440
Don't sit around and talk
about your inventions

08:26.440 --> 08:28.108
-(Char|ie mutters)
-or what you're working on now

08:28.108 --> 08:29.376
or what you would have done

08:29.376 --> 08:30.944
if somebody else hadn't
done it first.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.846
-Yes, dear.
-Nobody cares, Charlie.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.950
Charlie, my darling, we've got
to start living in the present!

08:36.950 --> 08:38.318
-Yes, dear.
-And clean your fingernails.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.320
-Yes, dear.
-And put on a suit.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.222
-Uh-huh.
-I don't care which one.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.825
Jus... Not that charcoal--
you look so seedy in that.

08:44.825 --> 08:45.951
CHARLIE:
Uh-huh.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.988
-(Char|ie humming softly)
-RUTH: Charlie?

08:54.234 --> 08:55.535
Charlie?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.536
(door opens)

08:56.536 --> 08:58.561
(footsteps approaching)

09:00.574 --> 09:02.509
I knew I'd find you down here.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.510
Yes, dear.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.546
Charlie, we have to get you out
of the junk business.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.548
But I love my inventions, dear.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.317
They're notjunk to me.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.453
Yes, I heard you boring
Mr. Jenkins with it.

09:13.453 --> 09:14.988
You seem upset, Ruth.

09:14.988 --> 09:19.259
Clarissa Sanderson said that
my bracelet was ostentatious.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.794
Now, do you think
that's ostentatious?

09:20.794 --> 09:23.497
Oh, how would you know?
You don't have any taste.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.232
I think everyone loved
your bracelet, dear.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.801
And did you see
the way she looked at me

09:27.801 --> 09:29.169
when I passed the caviar?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.837
Who the hell does she think
she is?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.639
It's definitely ostentatious.

09:32.639 --> 09:34.207
She's probably jealous.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.709
Well, of course she's jealous.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.811
Oh, my God,
my feet are killing me.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.045
(sirens wailing in distance)

09:39.045 --> 09:40.247
Dumb, vicious woman.

09:40.247 --> 09:43.884
I don't think she meant
to be vicious, dear.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.753
Are you defending
Clarissa Sanderson?

09:46.753 --> 09:50.223
No, dear.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.827
You never stick up for me,
do you, Charlie?

09:53.827 --> 09:56.997
Is that because you're
a weak-willed man,

09:56.997 --> 09:58.465
or do you hate me?

09:58.465 --> 10:00.600
I don't hate you, Ruth.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.769
Does Clarissa know

10:02.769 --> 10:04.204
that you're not any fun?

10:04.204 --> 10:05.939
Does she know that
you never want

10:05.939 --> 10:07.174
to go out dancing

10:07.174 --> 10:09.543
or that you don't like
meeting new people?

10:09.543 --> 10:12.045
I'm gonna tell you
something, Charlie.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.947
If you don't start shaping up,

10:13.947 --> 10:16.016
I may have to leave you.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.317
Now, that is not a threat.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.086
That is just a cold
fact of life.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.189
So you just remember that
the next time

10:22.189 --> 10:25.158
you stick up for
Clarissa Sanderson.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.093
(dogs barking,
knocking at door)

10:27.093 --> 10:28.461
That's right.

10:28.461 --> 10:32.399
Just walk away from me
while I'm still talking to you.

10:32.399 --> 10:36.436
(dog barking)

10:36.436 --> 10:38.004
I've come for my box.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.107
I hope I haven't come
at a bad time.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.677
He came for his box, Charlie.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.811
I know, dear.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.214
Have you found his box, Charlie?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.049
Not yet, dear.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.817
Louder, please.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.986
(slightly louder):
Not yet, dear.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.554
He's still looking.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.457
Oh, well, I don't mind waiting.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.660
Uh, go ahead, look away.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.430
Just pretend I'm not here.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.664
It shouldn't be hard to find.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.732
It's a little box.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.634
It has, uh, brass corners.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.636
And letters on it that say,
"Do not..."

11:09.636 --> 11:11.805
RUTH: Why don't you
come back next week?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.506
Next week? Oh, no, no, no.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.141
Next week won't do at all.

11:15.141 --> 11:18.578
If I don't get that box back
by midnight tomorrow night--

11:18.578 --> 11:21.648
unopened, of course,
that goes without saying--

11:21.648 --> 11:23.783
there'll be...
you-know-what to pay.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.151
RUTH:
In the meantime,

11:25.151 --> 11:26.720
I'm sure you won't mind
discussing

11:26.720 --> 11:28.822
-a few little problems.
-Problems?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.824
Let's start with the bracelet.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.826
I mean, it's big enough,

11:32.826 --> 11:35.693
but it's a little ostentatious,
don't you think?

11:36.863 --> 11:40.000
Ma'am, this bracelet belonged
to Marie Antoinette.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.302
Used jewelry?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.004
Well, no wonder.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.739
I only wear new.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.274
And there are nicks

11:47.274 --> 11:48.675
in that silver service upstairs.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.377
Is that secondhand, too?

11:50.377 --> 11:53.413
POSTMAN: That's been in Henry
Vlll's family for generations.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.016
Well, I am certainly not
going to eat

11:56.016 --> 11:58.184
off a dead person's silverware.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.655
This is highly irregular.

12:01.655 --> 12:05.525
I'm a fair man, but you
must realize there is a limit.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.127
Now, and about the sable--

12:07.127 --> 12:08.728
I don't have my monogram inside.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.463
I mean, Clarissa Sanderson--

12:10.463 --> 12:14.167
she has her monogram embroidered
right inside the lining.

12:14.167 --> 12:19.105
Oh, that makes it so much
more special, don't you think?

12:19.105 --> 12:21.374
Now, we don't have to talk
about it right this minute,

12:21.374 --> 12:24.036
but we sort of had in mind
a media center...

12:29.049 --> 12:31.210
(hissing)

12:40.960 --> 12:43.129
(alarm ringing)

12:43.129 --> 12:44.197
Ah.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.131
-Coffee?
-POSTMAN: Yes, thanks.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.570
N0 cream or Sugar.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.972
Uh, I'm watching the weight.

12:52.972 --> 12:55.809
This machine
has been chugging along

12:55.809 --> 12:59.145
for 35 years
without a single complaint.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.214
Sort of like me, you might say.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.749
Careful, now. It's hot.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.343
Oh. It's never bothered me.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.057
Isn't there something
you need, Charlie?

13:11.057 --> 13:13.226
Your wife has had
a lot of requests,

13:13.226 --> 13:15.995
but I don't remember you asking
for anything.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.664
Oh, I don't need anything.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.034
Oh, we all need something.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.904
Wouldn't you like to be young?

13:24.904 --> 13:27.140
-I mean, a lot younger.
-(Char|ie chuckles)

13:27.140 --> 13:30.043
You know, pretty girls,
fast cars.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.511
Yeah?

13:31.511 --> 13:35.749
I'd like to invent something
that could be useful to others.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.251
That's sort of my dream,
you might say.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.819
Nice.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.254
Very nice.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.556
RUTH:
Charlie!

13:43.556 --> 13:45.558
I'm sorry about your box.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.160
I don't even know where it is.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.262
-My wife won't tell me.
-(approaching footsteps)

13:49.262 --> 13:51.097
I'd give it back to you.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.032
-I really would.
-(door opening)

13:53.032 --> 13:55.702
Oh, I...

13:55.702 --> 13:57.137
Well, well, well.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.805
Look who's here.

13:58.805 --> 14:01.040
Hello, dear.
We've been waiting for you.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.075
Everything's here.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.343
I hope you approve.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.744
We try to be fair.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.146
What-What is this?

14:06.146 --> 14:07.781
It's an electric drill.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.916
Every craftsman's dream.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.018
(chuckles)
That's sweet of you, I'm sure,

14:12.018 --> 14:13.553
but I don't think we'll need it.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.054
What else is...?

14:15.054 --> 14:16.556
Oh.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.024
(gasps)

14:18.024 --> 14:20.660
I hope you like it.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.460
Well, I'm not sure.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.370
I think I'll have
to live with it a while.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.571
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.506
We don't have much time.

14:33.506 --> 14:37.277
I'm not very happy
with the Formica in the kitchen.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.879
There are ugly seams
around the joints.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.183
Clarissa Sanderson
has that ColorCore Formica.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.484
I'm sorry.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.419
This won't do at all.

14:46.419 --> 14:50.056
I've been a fair man
and a patient man,

14:50.056 --> 14:54.360
but I would like that box,
and I would like that box now.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.030
And I would like you
out of my house.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.465
Charlie, call the police.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.333
If you're going to be
that way about it,

15:00.333 --> 15:03.996
I suppose you leave me
no choice.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.372
Out of my house-- now!

15:11.311 --> 15:13.546
You weren't very nice
to him, Ruth.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.281
Charlie, you make me sick.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.816
What is that?

15:16.816 --> 15:19.486
It's a notice
of repossession, Ruth.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.621
He's taking back everything.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.057
You believe everything you read?

15:24.057 --> 15:27.494
This isn't worth the paper
that it's written on.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.195
He's nothing but a bluffer.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.631
I knew that the minute
I laid eyes on him.

15:31.631 --> 15:32.966
(sizzling)

15:32.966 --> 15:34.434
(explosion booms)

15:34.434 --> 15:37.062
(rumbling)

15:38.204 --> 15:39.606
RUTH:
What is it?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.665
What's happening up there?

15:50.016 --> 15:51.918
I did try to be fair, Charlie.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.486
I want you to know that.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.956
(door opens,
approaching footsteps)

15:56.956 --> 15:58.958
RUTH:
Charlie.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.427
There's nothing left.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.263
It's all gone.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.632
All our beautiful new couches
and the p...

16:05.632 --> 16:07.433
and the paneling
in the kitchen--

16:07.433 --> 16:10.303
it's all back
the way it used to be.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.238
Take a look in the mirror, Ruth.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.412
Oh, my God, it's not fair.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.215
My hair, my clothes...

16:22.215 --> 16:23.883
my bracelet.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.249
My elegant bracelet.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.579
Where is that box?

16:30.623 --> 16:34.360
Where is that box?

16:34.360 --> 16:35.628
Here.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.063
Here's your box.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.332
Now, we kept our end
of the bargain.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.357
I trust that you'll keep yours.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.072
This box has been opened.

16:46.072 --> 16:49.576
Well, I took one little,
tiny peek.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.777
I mean, it only took a second.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.713
I looked inside, and I-I-I saw
that it was... was empty.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.015
I don't know what all the fuss
is about.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.585
There was something
in it, all right.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.354
A thing more valuable
than any possession on earth.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.323
A human soul,

17:03.323 --> 17:06.826
delivered to you through
some strange quirk of fate.

17:06.826 --> 17:10.196
And you want to know
what all the fuss is about.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.198
MV: my, my.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.933
We're really very sorry.

17:13.933 --> 17:16.069
I'm afraid "sorry" won't do.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.104
I'm afraid...

17:18.104 --> 17:21.808
you'll have to supply
a replacement.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.844
Proper payment for payment due,
of course.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.846
Replacement for what?

17:26.846 --> 17:30.111
CHARLIE: I think he means
our souls, dear.

17:31.451 --> 17:34.520
You want our souls?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.522
One will suffice.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.358
We're not greedy.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.194
Let me see-- I have to be
in Washington at 3:00.

17:41.194 --> 17:44.030
There are always a lot
of pickups in Washington.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.065
And then Moscow at 4:00.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
Moscow's always a backbreaker.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.536
And Tripoli, Tehran...

17:50.536 --> 17:52.939
Uh, why don't I put
you good pe...

17:52.939 --> 17:56.306
you people down for midnight?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.817
(dog barking in distance)

18:04.817 --> 18:06.808
(knock at door)

18:10.657 --> 18:13.393
Charlie,
if you ever in your life

18:13.393 --> 18:16.262
did anything right,
do it tonight.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.526
(knocking on glass)

18:22.335 --> 18:24.326
(dog continues barking)

18:27.707 --> 18:29.475
Well, it's all straightened out,

18:29.475 --> 18:31.444
and you're not
going to believe this.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.912
You remember
I couldn't understand

18:32.912 --> 18:35.114
why you weren't
on my delivery list?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.783
Well, my nephew checked.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.752
You're on my list, all right,
but you're a pickup,

18:39.752 --> 18:42.188
not a delivery.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.179
(humming)

18:51.464 --> 18:53.199
Go.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.467
(ticking)

18:54.467 --> 18:57.203
(continues humming)

18:57.203 --> 18:59.728
I can't, Ruth.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.342
-(squishing thud)
-POSTMAN: Oh!

19:03.342 --> 19:04.777
Of course.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.547
Thou shalt not take the name
of the Lord in vain.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.916
Thou shall not covet
thy neighbor's possessions.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.317
Thou shall not kill.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.752
Of course, you were a pickup.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.753
It makes sense.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.288
Oh, I feel so much better.

19:15.288 --> 19:18.024
Now, hold still,
and you won't feel this a bit.

19:18.024 --> 19:22.120
-(Postman chanting)
-(Ruth sobbing, whimpering)

19:23.529 --> 19:25.520
(screaming)

19:30.470 --> 19:32.472
(Charlie humming)

19:32.472 --> 19:34.574
Oh, you'll be so pleased, dear.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.275
It finally works.

19:36.275 --> 19:39.011
RUTH: If it's working now,
it'll break, Charlie.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.948
And if it doesn't break,
nobody'll want it.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.016
And if somebody wants it,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.486
somebody else
will already own the...

19:46.486 --> 19:48.421
What are you doing?

19:48.421 --> 19:49.789
(continues humming)

19:49.789 --> 19:52.485
Stay away from me
with that thing...

19:53.960 --> 19:55.428
No!

19:55.428 --> 19:57.063
No, Charlie!

19:57.063 --> 19:58.531
Charlie, please!

19:58.531 --> 19:59.532
Stay away from me!

19:59.532 --> 20:00.600
(lid creaking)

20:00.600 --> 20:02.735
Oh, God!

20:02.735 --> 20:07.240
(echoing, fading):
No...!

20:07.240 --> 20:08.875
POSTMAN:
And it can't be opened?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.811
You'd have to destroy that box
before you could open it.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.579
(chuckling):
The boss'll love this.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.570
(knock at door)

20:20.486 --> 20:22.188
Good-bye, Charlie.

20:22.188 --> 20:26.522
(wind whistling)

20:38.404 --> 20:41.340
Oh, I hope you don't mind
my dropping in at you

20:41.340 --> 20:43.409
at this hour,
but as I was taking

20:43.409 --> 20:46.012
this lovely devil's food cake
out of the oven,

20:46.012 --> 20:49.415
a little voice said,
"Take this right up to Charlie."

20:49.415 --> 20:52.819
Why, Clarissa Sanderson,
you come right in here.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.320
Oh, my.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.789
But this is a cozy room.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.058
And so,
this is your workroom.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.159
Uh-huh.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.595
I love a room
that looks lived-in.

21:02.595 --> 21:06.432
Is this the desk where you
do all your work, Charlie?

21:06.432 --> 21:09.890
And, oh, my,

21:18.578 --> 21:22.381
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.917
Waiting for us to enter.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.721
Waiting to enter us.

21:28.721 --> 21:34.887
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
