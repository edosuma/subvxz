00:23.441 --> 00:24.484
Do you like it?

00:26.778 --> 00:27.779
It's fine.

00:28.029 --> 00:29.239
Fine?

00:31.616 --> 00:34.244
I didn't marry you for your cooking.

01:25.795 --> 01:27.338
Where is it?

01:37.682 --> 01:39.267
It's a miracle!

01:40.310 --> 01:42.145
Praise God!

01:52.030 --> 01:53.865
Move.

02:22.393 --> 02:23.436
Shit.

03:30.336 --> 03:32.255
This one's for you, Charlie.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.304
Oh, crap.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.980
Time is running out!

03:49.063 --> 03:50.899
It won't be long now!

03:52.150 --> 03:53.610
Y'all can try to ignore it.

03:54.485 --> 03:58.823
But it's gonna be hard to ignore
when your face is on fire!

04:03.161 --> 04:06.915
It's all about to be over! Over!

04:08.666 --> 04:10.001
Over!

04:11.961 --> 04:15.340
Look for the signs,
you sorry sons of bitches.

04:16.007 --> 04:18.718
'Cause shit is about to get real!

04:21.721 --> 04:26.684
So, no God,
no men in white suits, no nothing.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.020
Maybe I was wrong about this place.

04:31.064 --> 04:32.482
Maybe it was a bad idea.

04:32.565 --> 04:35.526
Nope. New Orleans is never
a bad idea, all right?

04:36.027 --> 04:39.906
Look, there's more to the city
than bloody jazz and almost getting killed.

04:39.989 --> 04:44.035
I think we should just take a break,
have some fun. Yeah?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.789
I know Denis knows what I'm talking about.
Isn't that right, Denis?

04:54.170 --> 04:55.254
What do you think?

04:55.880 --> 04:56.881
Mmm?

04:57.465 --> 04:59.717
Me? Yeah. I'm up for whatever.

05:02.971 --> 05:04.555
I know just the place.

05:10.478 --> 05:16.025
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five,

05:16.109 --> 05:19.821
four, three, two, one!

05:24.158 --> 05:25.910
Yeah!

05:31.541 --> 05:32.917
Yeah!

05:33.001 --> 05:35.712
Hold up, hold up.
Excuse me, excuse me.

05:36.254 --> 05:39.674
All you gotta do is get shot and stand up?

05:40.550 --> 05:42.135
Heck, my boyfriend will do that!

05:42.218 --> 05:45.138
What? No. I'm not sure I wanna try.

05:45.221 --> 05:48.891
Oh, come on.
It's like a what? Like a bee sting, right?

05:49.267 --> 05:50.268
Yeah.

05:50.351 --> 05:53.688
Yeah. Like a bee sting.

05:55.565 --> 05:59.444
Excuse me. Hold on now, hold on.

05:59.736 --> 06:02.655
What do you think
the good Lord would say about this?

06:04.949 --> 06:06.784
I think He'd say, "Go back to your choirboys,

06:06.868 --> 06:09.203
"and mind your own business, Preacher."

06:09.454 --> 06:11.414
Listen to your hearts, men.

06:11.998 --> 06:13.541
Ask yourselves.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.586
Is this really the right thing to do?

06:18.963 --> 06:22.592
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was ladies' night.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.386
Now, I got a bunch of money.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.263
You got a bunch of guns.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.475
So, why don't y'all stop being a bunch of
bitches and shoot my boyfriend?

06:33.269 --> 06:34.645
What's your pleasure?

06:35.063 --> 06:36.981
Oh! Um...

06:38.983 --> 06:41.402
The big ones pay more, right?

06:41.486 --> 06:44.697
Okay. So, in that case...

06:44.781 --> 06:45.990
Why not choose the biggest one?

06:47.950 --> 06:48.951
The big one.

06:49.827 --> 06:52.914
- The biggest?
- If you have such a love for money,

06:52.997 --> 06:54.582
and so little love for life,

06:55.500 --> 06:57.126
why not pick the biggest one they got?

06:59.504 --> 07:01.422
Or maybe it's ladies' night, after all?

07:02.048 --> 07:03.216
I think one of the smaller...

07:03.299 --> 07:06.052
All right. Biggest one it is.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.304
You got it.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.020
Oh, dear God.

07:21.776 --> 07:23.653
You got this, okay?

07:24.028 --> 07:28.032
Remember. Just hold your breath.
And I love you.

07:29.367 --> 07:31.035
I love you, too.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.843
<i>Parli d'amore...</i>

07:46.926 --> 07:48.594
Uh...

07:48.678 --> 07:49.679
All right, gentlemen...

07:57.019 --> 07:59.856
Sweetie? Sweetie? Honey?

08:05.069 --> 08:06.154
He's gone.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.738
What?

08:09.657 --> 08:12.285
No!

08:13.953 --> 08:15.413
Someone call the police!

08:15.913 --> 08:17.832
You're all witnesses.

08:17.915 --> 08:23.087
I call upon your Christian sense of decency
to stand up and give your account.

08:28.593 --> 08:29.594
Here.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.139
You okay?

08:33.222 --> 08:37.643
You kidding me? Open bar.

08:41.439 --> 08:44.275
<i>In new footage
from the Nghe An province of Vietnam,</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:47.069
<i>we're witnessing
what some are referring to as a miracle,</i>

08:47.153 --> 08:50.072
<i>and what others are dismissing
as a simple hoax.</i>

08:50.156 --> 08:51.532
<i>As a local pig has achieved
what appears to be...</i>

08:53.075 --> 08:56.621
<i>...a form of levitation or "floating."
Currently, experts...</i>

09:03.836 --> 09:04.962
Home.

09:07.798 --> 09:10.134
I am having fun.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.639
Yeah, that kiss with Cass looked pretty fun.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.058
Very convincing.

09:18.434 --> 09:19.644
Yeah.

09:20.937 --> 09:22.605
Come on. You'll sleep tonight.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.690
I don't wanna sleep, Jesse.

09:25.316 --> 09:26.901
How many times do I have tell you?

09:26.984 --> 09:28.277
What is your problem?

09:29.987 --> 09:31.113
Ever since the Saint, you've been...

09:31.197 --> 09:32.740
What's your problem, huh?

09:37.161 --> 09:39.497
- Let's go.
- Let's just go yourself.

09:41.457 --> 09:43.292
- You can't just...
- "You can't just..."

09:43.376 --> 09:45.253
- Repeat everything...
- "Repeat everything..."

09:46.170 --> 09:47.338
- I say.
- "I say."

09:48.673 --> 09:50.466
That's not a comeback...

09:59.684 --> 10:01.310
He's gone, right?

10:04.272 --> 10:05.773
You sent him back to Hell?

10:10.528 --> 10:11.862
He's gone.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.161
Come on. Let's go home.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:26.377 --> 10:29.422
Where you going? The night's still young.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.883
We haven't even drank the Armagnac yet.

10:35.553 --> 10:38.306
Bollocks. Sorry about that, Denis.
Go on. You were sayin'?

10:50.943 --> 10:53.446
- Yeah.
- I'm happy, too.

10:53.738 --> 10:54.739
All right.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.533
Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.495
This man has been trying to tell you
that he's very unhappy.

11:01.579 --> 11:03.622
Yeah? And what the hell
would you know about it?

11:03.914 --> 11:05.666
I'm a French professor from Tulane.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.793
Oh, right. Could you...

11:08.586 --> 11:10.296
Would you mind, Professor?

11:12.340 --> 11:13.341
Mmm-hmm.

11:14.675 --> 11:19.430
He, and my condolences,
says that he is dying.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.641
What?

11:23.392 --> 11:25.436
Congestive heart disease.

11:26.145 --> 11:27.646
He's been telling you that

11:27.730 --> 11:32.068
you've been an awful, selfish, absent father.

11:33.444 --> 11:36.530
He keeps repeating
that there's something you could do, though,

11:36.614 --> 11:38.532
that would make it all up to him.

11:38.616 --> 11:41.285
Yeah.
What is it? I'll do anything.

11:42.203 --> 11:44.789
He says that he wants to live forever.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.504
And he thinks that you can help him do that.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.090
What?

11:54.799 --> 11:57.927
No, no, no. No.

11:58.010 --> 12:01.555
Absolutely, absolutely not.

12:05.059 --> 12:06.394
Do you hear me?

12:07.103 --> 12:08.145
No.

12:21.158 --> 12:24.078
He said then, he will die hating you.

12:26.664 --> 12:28.499
Yeah, most people do.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.593
<i>...or, yes, pig.</i>

12:39.677 --> 12:43.347
<i>Meanwhile, media specialists
speculate that this may simply be</i>

12:43.431 --> 12:48.144
<i>a viral marketing ploy
publicizing an, as yet, unrevealed film</i>

12:48.227 --> 12:50.938
<i>or, perhaps, a weight loss drug.</i>

12:56.777 --> 12:58.404
Yes, it's serious.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.992
They're praying to a pig.

13:03.826 --> 13:07.621
This will require resources.
Prep the invalid scientist.

13:14.712 --> 13:15.713
Mmm.

13:21.552 --> 13:24.972
No, no. I expect we'll need
an extra 30 operatives

13:25.055 --> 13:27.725
all fully equipped with, uh...

13:29.852 --> 13:32.730
Second thought, never mind.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.235
I have the situation under control.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.409
You missed a spot.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.747
I'm so sorry.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.502
Don't worry, little boy.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.880
I was young and careless.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.257
Once.

14:05.304 --> 14:08.933
Klaus Helmut Starr.
Born in Hamburg, Germany.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.852
Only child of parents killed in a plane crash,

14:11.936 --> 14:13.521
orphaned at age four.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.022
Currently, Lieutenant Colonel

14:15.105 --> 14:19.360
of Germany's GSG-Nine
Elite Anti-Terrorism unit,

14:19.443 --> 14:21.529
where your exploits were...

14:23.113 --> 14:24.365
Numerous.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.617
How was your flight?

14:27.660 --> 14:29.912
I hope you found the hotel accommodating.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.581
I was told there'd be women.

14:33.624 --> 14:34.625
Women?

14:34.708 --> 14:38.754
A high-end brothel
staffed entirely by Ukrainian runaways.

14:39.797 --> 14:43.968
There will be women. In time.
If that's your desire.

14:44.760 --> 14:48.347
But it's my impression, <i>Herr</i> Starr,

14:48.722 --> 14:50.307
that what you really want

14:51.100 --> 14:56.855
is "to sweep the streets clean
of the parasites that befoul our society,

14:56.939 --> 15:00.568
"and create a civilization
based on the principles of absolute order

15:00.651 --> 15:02.820
"and uncompromising discipline."

15:05.155 --> 15:06.490
Your words, I believe.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.289
What if I told you

15:14.039 --> 15:17.793
that our organization
feels exactly the same way you do?

15:18.836 --> 15:23.090
Like a 10-inch dick,
I'd need to see it to believe it.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.883
And maybe you shall.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.177
Tell me...

15:30.764 --> 15:34.018
Are you Christian, <i>Herr</i> Starr?

15:35.728 --> 15:37.813
Does it make a difference?

15:37.896 --> 15:39.481
This is just the first step

15:39.565 --> 15:42.067
in our organization's
rigorous screening process.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.194
Only the most deserving

15:44.278 --> 15:47.865
and, yes, pious candidates
will be considered.

15:53.287 --> 15:57.291
Then I am very much a Christian.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.065
He's one of mine.

21:51.853 --> 21:53.605
Shit. Shit.

21:53.855 --> 21:54.898
Shit. Shit.

22:01.363 --> 22:02.406
Time's up.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.251
<i>Hear me and tremble.</i>

22:15.002 --> 22:18.255
<i>And know the signs of the world to come!</i>

22:18.547 --> 22:20.882
<i>Look for the changes,</i>

22:21.216 --> 22:23.468
<i>for things impossible.</i>

22:24.094 --> 22:28.265
<i>The dying land, the falling sky,</i>

22:28.348 --> 22:32.144
<i>the beasts of the field
thrown into confusion...</i>

22:32.227 --> 22:34.604
Hey. How'd you sleep?

22:36.189 --> 22:37.983
I dreamt about him again.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.403
And Cassidy's fingers

22:42.821 --> 22:45.490
falling like French fries on TV.

22:53.623 --> 22:54.624
I'm sorry.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.460
You were late.

23:00.047 --> 23:01.631
I almost didn't make it.

23:02.507 --> 23:05.969
- I know, I...
- I mean, if it hadn't been for Cassidy...

23:10.807 --> 23:13.226
I had my hands pretty full myself.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.104
I got back, I stopped him. That's it.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.815
Can't you feel it, Jesse?

23:20.233 --> 23:21.234
Hmm?

23:22.110 --> 23:23.320
That...

23:24.279 --> 23:26.323
That "something's not right" feeling?

23:26.406 --> 23:27.866
No, I can't.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.538
Don't know what to tell you, Tulip.

23:40.504 --> 23:41.588
Where are you goin'?

23:41.671 --> 23:44.216
I'm gonna go and talk to a man
about the end of the world.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.094
You wanna come?

23:50.180 --> 23:51.556
'Course you don't.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.686
- Where's Cassidy?
- I don't know.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.332
Hello?

24:18.667 --> 24:20.210
Hello?

24:23.338 --> 24:26.424
Oh, bollocks. Not again.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.389
Today,

24:32.472 --> 24:36.685
you will compete in a series of trials
designed to test your abilities.

24:38.228 --> 24:42.732
You have all been selected
because you are, simply put, the best.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.318
The strongest,

24:46.027 --> 24:47.487
the smartest,

24:48.572 --> 24:50.073
the most able.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.577
And yet, only one of you

24:54.327 --> 24:58.123
will prove worthy enough to join our ranks.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.837
But before we begin,
are there any questions?

25:04.129 --> 25:05.589
Do you validate parking?

25:12.262 --> 25:13.763
No, we do not.

25:14.014 --> 25:17.767
£12 an hour, and you don't validate.

25:18.185 --> 25:19.352
It's standard policy.

25:19.436 --> 25:23.023
Then it should have been clearly stated,
as such, beforehand.

25:23.857 --> 25:26.443
So that I may have found street parking.

25:27.110 --> 25:31.448
Or, more likely, given
the failure of this organization to, in any way,

25:31.531 --> 25:35.577
convenience me, not come at all.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.290
Validate his car.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.793
But, Starr,

25:43.877 --> 25:46.630
from here on out, we do the testing.

25:53.553 --> 25:55.931
<i>He was just a rookie trooper</i>

25:56.014 --> 25:58.516
<i>And he surely shook with fright</i>

25:58.600 --> 26:00.518
<i>He checked all his equipment</i>

26:00.602 --> 26:03.230
<i>And made sure his pack was tight</i>

26:03.313 --> 26:07.567
<i>He had to sit and listen
to the awful engines roar</i>

26:07.651 --> 26:11.863
<i>You ain't gonna jump no more...</i>

26:11.947 --> 26:14.741
We've come a long way
when it comes to weapons of warfare.

26:14.824 --> 26:18.119
But sometimes, there is no substitution

26:18.453 --> 26:20.038
for hand-to-hand violence.

26:21.831 --> 26:25.627
<i>Gory, gory
What a hell of a way to die...</i>

26:26.836 --> 26:30.507
<i>Gory, gory
What a hell of a way to die</i>

26:30.840 --> 26:35.011
<i>Gory, gory
What a hell of a way to die</i>

26:35.095 --> 26:36.930
<i>He ain't gonna jump no more</i>

26:39.641 --> 26:44.104
<i>"Is everybody happy?"
cried the sergeant looking up...</i>

26:44.396 --> 26:45.939
Starr, you're up.

26:49.025 --> 26:53.196
<i>He jumped into the icy blast
His static line unhooked...</i>

26:53.405 --> 26:57.492
I want everyone to know
that what is about to transpire,

26:57.575 --> 26:59.411
I take no pleasure in it.

27:01.329 --> 27:02.706
And...

27:12.173 --> 27:13.717
What the hell are you doing?

27:13.800 --> 27:16.594
What does it look like?
I'm self-consummating.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.644
Very good.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.399
Please, take note that a distraction,

27:29.858 --> 27:31.484
no matter how unseemly,

27:31.568 --> 27:34.821
can very often be the thing
that turns the tide in your favor.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.747
Since the days of Cleopatra,

27:44.080 --> 27:48.710
sexuality has been a weapon
deployed to gain leverage.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.838
This is the art of seduction.

27:55.175 --> 27:57.927
I know we come from different sides.

27:58.511 --> 28:03.433
But I think... No, I know,
we can put all that behind us.

28:04.434 --> 28:08.605
We can make something beautiful and new.

28:14.277 --> 28:15.737
All you have to do

28:15.820 --> 28:19.616
is meet me at the train station
with the microfiche.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.744
And time.

28:25.622 --> 28:26.790
Ooh. Um...

28:27.290 --> 28:29.584
Anyone know where I can get
a copy of that microfiche?

28:30.001 --> 28:31.002
Yes.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.629
Very good indeed.

28:32.754 --> 28:33.922
Starr.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.892
And, go.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.729
I told you already, Mr. Peterson.

28:49.813 --> 28:50.855
The answer is no.

28:52.690 --> 28:55.151
I shouldn't even be meeting you right now.

28:57.654 --> 29:01.533
Give me the microfiche, you bitch,
or I'll kill you and your family.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.992
Two final candidates.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.245
One last opportunity to prove your worth.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.040
Proceed.

29:54.377 --> 29:58.631
<i>Gory, gory
What a hell of a way to die</i>

29:58.715 --> 30:03.428
<i>He ain't gonna jump no more...</i>

30:04.095 --> 30:05.138
Good luck.

30:05.305 --> 30:10.810
<i>Gory, gory
What a hell of a way to die</i>

30:12.270 --> 30:15.023
<i>Gory, gory
What a hell of a way to die</i>

30:17.942 --> 30:24.741
<i>He ain't gonna jump no more</i>

30:26.743 --> 30:29.162
Welcome to the Grail.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.289
The Grail?

30:31.372 --> 30:33.583
Please, <i>Herr</i> Starr, have a seat.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.173
For over 2,000 years,

30:40.256 --> 30:44.010
this organization has been
at the very heart of world affairs.

30:45.261 --> 30:49.140
What do you think
is the source of our enduring power?

30:49.432 --> 30:52.810
I would imagine
a combination of economic influence

30:52.894 --> 30:54.604
and sexual blackmail.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.689
Some, of course.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.859
But the true inspiration

31:00.610 --> 31:04.489
of our authority is...

31:08.785 --> 31:10.161
Christ.

31:10.245 --> 31:11.246
Hmm.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.332
You seem disappointed.

31:14.916 --> 31:19.295
I was hoping for something more
in the vein of atomic warfare.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.340
Not myths and legends.

31:22.423 --> 31:25.385
This is no myth. Christ lives on.

31:25.468 --> 31:27.679
Yes, yes. He lives in our hearts.

31:27.762 --> 31:28.972
No, <i>Herr</i> Starr.

31:29.222 --> 31:34.561
Christ lives in a top secret location
guarded by machine guns.

31:38.439 --> 31:39.524
Does he?

31:39.607 --> 31:40.608
Yes.

31:41.526 --> 31:46.114
You see, before
he sacrificed himself for our sins,

31:46.197 --> 31:47.949
our Lord

31:48.032 --> 31:51.160
gave a final gift to humanity.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.497
He fathered a child.

31:59.544 --> 32:02.755
For generations,
the Grail has protected this holy lineage

32:02.839 --> 32:05.633
in preparation for one event.

32:06.509 --> 32:08.011
The end of the world.

32:09.012 --> 32:12.390
Only God knows exactly when,
but it will be soon.

32:12.473 --> 32:15.852
We have been assured
from sources at the highest levels.

32:16.686 --> 32:19.981
And the Grail will be ready.

32:20.857 --> 32:25.153
And at the exact moment
that hope is abandoned,

32:25.862 --> 32:30.575
our savior will reveal himself
to the frightened masses.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.454
Ingenious.

32:34.537 --> 32:37.624
The world on its knees,
begging for direction,

32:37.707 --> 32:40.793
like the ugly girl at a gangbang.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.132
Your uniform.

32:51.596 --> 32:56.225
Some of the men find it a bit flamboyant.

32:58.936 --> 33:02.398
It's spectacular.

33:06.069 --> 33:11.407
May I ask, what would be
my specific role in all this?

33:11.824 --> 33:15.495
The Samson unit of the Grail
handles the false prophets.

33:15.995 --> 33:18.039
Contenders to Christ's throne.

33:18.706 --> 33:21.834
Our job is to rid the world
of their competing narratives.

33:22.418 --> 33:27.090
Charlemagne, Lincoln, Belushi, you name it.

33:28.549 --> 33:32.345
You will be my right-hand man.

33:35.765 --> 33:39.060
- The Grail killed Abraham Lincoln?
- Mmm.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.895
Yes, we did.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.815
And why did we do that?

33:44.565 --> 33:46.275
He preserved the union,

33:47.276 --> 33:50.822
won the war, sense of humor.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.658
His polling was probably through the roof.

33:55.576 --> 33:56.703
Something tells me

33:56.786 --> 34:00.123
you're going to do
great things here, <i>Herr</i> Starr.

34:02.959 --> 34:06.379
Thank you for this opportunity.

34:55.261 --> 34:58.431
Blood, people! Blood and brains!

34:58.514 --> 35:01.893
And people screaming until their lungs hurt!

35:01.976 --> 35:05.688
That's how bad it's gonna be.
That is what's comin'!

35:07.190 --> 35:09.317
So, watch your asses.

35:09.400 --> 35:12.278
I'm takin' five. Don't forget the beer bucket.

35:17.867 --> 35:21.162
Ah, Father, I noticed you standing there.

35:22.455 --> 35:25.458
Always good to see
a fellow soldier for the Lord.

35:27.126 --> 35:28.252
Question for you.

35:28.336 --> 35:29.378
Hit me.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.717
Are you crazy or just a con man?

35:35.843 --> 35:37.303
Are those my only two choices?

35:37.386 --> 35:39.597
'Cause I normally describe myself

35:39.680 --> 35:43.851
as a left-handed,
alcoholic, sinner child of God.

35:47.063 --> 35:48.397
I don't mean to insult you.

35:48.981 --> 35:52.735
It's just... I've been wondering
about the end of the world.

35:55.238 --> 35:56.572
Well...

35:58.199 --> 36:00.201
Buy me a beer. We'll wonder together.

36:01.244 --> 36:03.538
Sorry again about the confusion.

36:03.621 --> 36:06.916
Ever since the carts
started operating in tandem,

36:06.999 --> 36:09.335
- you'd be surprised how much this happens.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:09.627 --> 36:10.795
I'm used to it.

36:10.878 --> 36:13.923
Alcohol and a lack of vital signs
will do it to you every time.

36:20.096 --> 36:21.097
Oh...

36:22.640 --> 36:23.850
Poor people.

36:25.268 --> 36:28.396
I'd rather be them than him.

36:32.149 --> 36:33.442
Yeah.

37:05.057 --> 37:08.644
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

37:08.728 --> 37:10.062
six, five, four...

37:26.203 --> 37:29.832
I'm real sorry about your boyfriend, ma'am.
Terrible loss.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.045
Y'all should be sorry.

37:36.130 --> 37:38.633
We robbed you assholes blind.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.137
That wasn't my boyfriend,
and he wasn't dead.

37:44.931 --> 37:49.018
We came in here,
played y'all for the idiots y'all are,

37:50.186 --> 37:52.521
took your money, and drank your beer.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.816
So, put your goddamn hats back on.

37:56.817 --> 38:01.489
And tell me which one of you
banjo diddlin' little bitches

38:01.572 --> 38:05.534
has got the balls to earn your money back?

38:38.401 --> 38:42.238
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

38:42.321 --> 38:45.032
six, five, four...

38:53.958 --> 38:55.209
Again.

39:02.925 --> 39:06.595
So, the world's ending, huh?

39:06.929 --> 39:07.930
Mmm-hmm.

39:09.932 --> 39:11.017
Why?

39:11.809 --> 39:13.477
What makes you say that?

39:15.271 --> 39:16.731
Common sense.

39:16.814 --> 39:18.524
Science.

39:18.607 --> 39:20.526
The world's been ending since it started.

39:21.235 --> 39:22.653
That's not an answer.

39:23.112 --> 39:24.447
What's the question?

39:25.865 --> 39:28.284
What are you looking for? Proof?

39:28.951 --> 39:30.828
Well, that's what
you're advertising here, right?

39:30.911 --> 39:32.997
Signs of the apocalypse and all that.

39:33.122 --> 39:35.082
Ah...

39:36.584 --> 39:38.711
That's mostly just metaphor.

39:40.796 --> 39:44.300
I hear things, I see things.

39:45.342 --> 39:49.805
People come up to me,
they say all sorts of crazy stuff.

39:50.556 --> 39:53.517
And there has been an uptake
ever since Tom Cruise exploded.

39:53.601 --> 39:54.977
No question.

39:56.979 --> 39:58.773
The Cubs winning. Trump.

40:01.484 --> 40:02.735
This flying pig.

40:02.818 --> 40:05.237
That's real Wrath of God stuff, right?

40:06.864 --> 40:09.950
But sooner or later,
there's always an explanation.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.620
Strong pitchin',

40:13.662 --> 40:15.706
KGB interference, whatever.

40:18.292 --> 40:21.837
In the end, there's always a good reason.

40:23.422 --> 40:27.426
So, you're just out here
scarin' people. For money.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.136
They are already scared.

40:29.762 --> 40:32.264
They come listen to me
talk about the end of the world,

40:32.348 --> 40:35.267
so they can worry about that
instead of what really scares 'em.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.061
Which is what?

40:39.688 --> 40:40.898
Themselves.

40:43.109 --> 40:47.696
What is more frightening
than who we are and what we done?

40:52.034 --> 40:55.788
Well, I have got car payments,
and a drinking problem.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.873
So, I should probably get back to it.

40:58.833 --> 40:59.875
Hey.

41:03.129 --> 41:07.258
You hear about this whole
fractional soul-selling thing?

41:08.217 --> 41:09.385
The Japanese, sure.

41:09.635 --> 41:12.930
This parishioner came to me about it.

41:15.391 --> 41:18.477
Just thinkin' about
selling a small amount of his, you know?

41:18.561 --> 41:20.646
Of course I said, "No way."

41:21.730 --> 41:23.899
This guy was in quite a tough situation,

41:24.817 --> 41:26.861
friends were in trouble, needed help.

41:27.486 --> 41:30.865
So, by selling off this small part of his soul,

41:30.948 --> 41:34.910
and I mean, just tiny, like, 1%.

41:37.246 --> 41:42.835
I thought, maybe it was a sacrifice
worth making, you know?

41:49.592 --> 41:54.430
I would tell your parishioner
that if he wants to help his friends,

41:55.306 --> 41:57.141
he should give a kidney.

42:04.315 --> 42:07.193
And if you're looking
for signs of the apocalypse,

42:08.068 --> 42:11.488
I would start with men selling off their souls.

42:31.467 --> 42:33.594
The situation has been handled.

42:35.721 --> 42:36.972
Where to next?

42:37.056 --> 42:38.641
<i>New Orleans, sir.</i>

42:38.724 --> 42:40.392
And the target?

42:40.476 --> 42:43.062
<i>A preacher, Jesse Custer.</i>

42:43.145 --> 42:44.772
I'm on my way.

43:09.713 --> 43:12.508
<i>The water was highly toxic.</i>

43:12.591 --> 43:15.594
<i>I'm sorry,
but would you mind explaining it again?</i>

43:15.678 --> 43:19.932
<i>The water killed
the whole village, made the pig float.</i>

43:20.474 --> 43:22.685
<i>The water made the pig float?</i>

43:23.602 --> 43:27.731
<i>How could contaminated water
produce such an unusual effect?</i>

43:28.315 --> 43:31.193
<i>It was saturated
with hydrogen atoms,</i>

43:31.277 --> 43:33.362
<i>permeated the pig's tissue,</i>

43:33.445 --> 43:37.658
<i>resulted in limited levitation,
like a meat balloon.</i>

43:37.741 --> 43:38.867
<i>Meat balloon?</i>

43:38.951 --> 43:40.286
<i>Meat balloon.</i>

43:40.369 --> 43:42.454
<i>It just seems so incredible...</i>

43:42.538 --> 43:44.999
<i>Remind me. Are you a scientist?</i>

43:45.666 --> 43:46.709
<i>No.</i>

43:47.501 --> 43:49.211
<i>Well, then shut up.</i>
