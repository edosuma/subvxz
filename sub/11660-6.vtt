00:53.967 --> 00:57.533
Girls! Girls, it's here! I am so excited.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.100
It's my letter from
the Elvis Presley fan club.

01:00.533 --> 01:03.233
My hands are shaking.
Dorothy, you read it.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.467
"Dear Rose Nylund,

01:04.533 --> 01:08.934
your application to start an unauthorized
chapter of the Elvis Presley

01:09.000 --> 01:11.567
hunk-a hunk-a burning love fan club...

01:12.000 --> 01:15.367
in your neighborhood and/or trailer park
has been accepted."

01:15.433 --> 01:18.567
This is the most
fulfilling day of my life.

01:19.033 --> 01:22.033
Which makes you the most pathetic human
being on this planet.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.667
(telephone rings)

01:25.734 --> 01:27.934
Well, I love Elvis.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.734
Would you be the first member

01:30.800 --> 01:32.934
of the hunk-a hunk-a
burning love fan club?

01:33.000 --> 01:37.300
I graciously accept and promise to do
a good job as president.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.867
Why should you be president?

01:40.934 --> 01:45.533
-I saw Elvis in <i>Harem Scarem</i> 50 times.
-So did I.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.900
I have every album he recorded.

01:47.967 --> 01:50.567
So have I... and every single.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.266
I slept with him in a motel 6
outside of Chattanooga.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.367
Congratulations, madam president.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.567
Why did you say that? You didn't really
sleep with Elvis Presley.

02:05.633 --> 02:08.700
Where I'm from,
there were a lot hillbilly boys

02:08.767 --> 02:11.300
with muttonchop sideburns named Elvis.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.500
The light was bad in the bayou.
It could have happened.

02:15.667 --> 02:18.166
Blanche, you never slept
with Elvis Presley.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.700
Oh, all right, all right.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.867
But I once did make love
to an unattractive boy

02:22.934 --> 02:25.467
named Ernest, and in the middle
of it I cried out Elvis' name.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.367
Technically, I think that counts.

02:31.367 --> 02:32.500
Ma, what's the matter?

02:33.533 --> 02:35.233
Esther Weinstock is dead.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.100
We grew up together.
She was my best friend.

02:38.166 --> 02:42.166
I'm so sorry. What happened?

02:42.233 --> 02:46.533
She was fighting an oil rig fire
in the Gulf of Mexico. She was 88.

02:48.266 --> 02:51.467
It's great that she was able to work
right up to the end.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.033
-When is the funeral?
-Wednesday.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.667
I'll go to Brooklyn with you.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.867
I'm not going. You know why.

03:05.867 --> 03:08.200
I guess the body was lost at sea.

03:12.133 --> 03:15.567
Ma doesn't want to go to the funeral
because Esther's husband--

03:15.633 --> 03:17.200
Max Weinstock will be there.

03:17.266 --> 03:20.133
I won't stand under the same roof
with that miserable botchagaloop

03:20.200 --> 03:21.333
and you know why.

03:22.266 --> 03:26.567
Years ago, Max and my father
were business partners.

03:26.633 --> 03:29.467
They ran a pizza-knish stand
in Coney island.

03:30.767 --> 03:31.967
One day pop came home

03:32.033 --> 03:35.367
and said that Max had
gambled away the profits.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.667
Well, they went broke.
Ma never forgave him.

03:38.734 --> 03:41.533
Max and Salvadore were business partners.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.834
-They already know.
-That's what I figured.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.567
I got my heel caught in the carpet.

03:47.567 --> 03:51.867
Are you sure you
don't want to go to her funeral?

03:51.934 --> 03:54.667
I swore a Sicilian oath

03:54.734 --> 03:57.300
I would never cast eyes
on Max Weinstock again.

03:57.367 --> 04:01.200
-Nothing will change my mind.
-I'll buy both tickets.

04:01.266 --> 04:04.800
Book business class. If I watch the<i> Three</i>
<i>Amigos,</i> I'll need champagne.

04:06.200 --> 04:12.033
(serene music playing)

04:29.767 --> 04:31.400
All right, Dorothy, let's get out of here!

04:32.633 --> 04:35.300
We have to pay our respects to the family.

04:35.367 --> 04:39.967
If you see Max, don't make another scene
like at the funeral.

04:40.266 --> 04:43.467
It's not my fault the klutz tripped
over my foot

04:43.533 --> 04:45.266
and nearly fell into an open grave.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.367
You didn't have to yell, "Start
shoveling, boys," as he tried to get up.

04:54.667 --> 04:55.800
Sophia?

04:56.467 --> 04:58.433
Dorothy, do you hear a dog howling?

04:59.033 --> 05:01.533
Behave yourself. Hello, Mr. Weinstock.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.300
Oh, my goodness.
As I live and breathe.

05:04.367 --> 05:05.767
Unfortunately.

05:06.867 --> 05:09.200
-You're little Dorothy Petrillo.
-That's right.

05:09.266 --> 05:11.000
You haven't changed a bit.

05:11.367 --> 05:15.100
Same gorgeous smile, pretty eyes,
beautiful figure,

05:15.166 --> 05:16.767
long, golden-blonde hair.

05:16.834 --> 05:19.233
You have cataracts, don't you,
Mr. Weinstock?

05:21.033 --> 05:23.667
-Since 1967.
-Let's go.

05:24.800 --> 05:25.934
Sophia,

05:26.000 --> 05:28.166
Esther would have appreciated
you being here.

05:30.300 --> 05:32.200
I loved that woman. She was the best.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.333
She deserved a better husband

05:34.400 --> 05:38.133
instead of a miserable,
no-good, lowlife sleaze ball.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.467
Sophia, if you knew now
what I knew then...

05:42.266 --> 05:44.000
ah! So what.

05:44.633 --> 05:47.233
If you've got something to say,
spit it out.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.700
Don't push me, or I will.

05:51.233 --> 05:53.900
There, I pushed. Too bad you
weren't around a flight of stairs.

05:53.967 --> 05:56.633
You're creating a scene.

05:56.700 --> 05:59.033
That was a long time ago. Forget it.

05:59.100 --> 06:04.166
He stole money from us.
Because of him, our family went hungry.

06:04.233 --> 06:07.767
-We never went hungry.
-Some nights I felt like dessert.

06:11.033 --> 06:16.600
Sophia, I kept a secret for 40 years
because I didn't want to break your heart.

06:16.667 --> 06:20.300
Now that I know it's made of stone,
I'll tell the truth.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.867
Brooklyn 1949...

06:23.734 --> 06:27.400
We were sitting at this table
playing a spirited game of...

06:27.700 --> 06:29.133
-Gin.
-Aw.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.934
-That's four in a row.
-I hope that'll continue once we get home.

06:35.934 --> 06:39.934
The man buys a new t-shirt, trims his ear
hair, suddenly he's Charles Boyer.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.600
How was business today?

06:42.667 --> 06:46.467
There wasn't a pizza or knish
left on the shelf.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.633
I'd love some coffee.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.567
-I'll get everybody some.
-I'll help.

06:54.633 --> 06:57.433
Max, there's something
I have to tell you.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.834
What's wrong?

06:58.900 --> 07:01.734
I lost the week's receipts on a horse.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.667
-You what?
-It was a sure thing.

07:05.734 --> 07:09.600
I don't believe it.
That means we're out of business.

07:09.667 --> 07:12.166
-We're through.
-So's my marriage.

07:12.233 --> 07:15.500
If Sophia finds out, she'll put me out.
Max, I'm sorry.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.433
Coffee will be ready in a minute!

07:18.734 --> 07:23.934
-Sophia, I have something to tell you.
-Wait, wait. Let me tell her.

07:24.367 --> 07:28.266
Sophia, we're out of business.
I gambled the money away.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.333
-That's not true.
-I wish it wasn't.

07:30.700 --> 07:35.500
-That's what happened. I'm sorry.
-Unbelievable! This is insane.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.433
-Calm down.
-Calm down?

07:37.500 --> 07:40.667
Did you hear what he just said?

07:41.266 --> 07:43.700
Salvadore wanted to tell you.
I wouldn't let him.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.500
I cared for you both too much
to let your marriage break up.

07:48.033 --> 07:52.367
Sal felt so guilty,
he never gambled again. It was worth it.

07:52.433 --> 07:56.734
That was a lovely thing you did.
Wasn't it, Ma?

07:56.800 --> 08:00.000
-Wasn't it, Ma?
-Ah, forget it.

08:00.066 --> 08:01.567
It's ancient history.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.400
-Say something.
-I can't.

08:04.467 --> 08:06.700
Sicilians have a hard time with apologies.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.066
They also have a hard time
passing wet cement

08:10.133 --> 08:11.800
without putting someone in it.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.400
They manage. Go on.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.633
Uh...

08:20.100 --> 08:23.000
Max... there's something I got to say
to you.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.633
What?

08:26.233 --> 08:27.300
The knishes...

08:28.433 --> 08:29.467
they're pretty good.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.467
Apology accepted.

08:33.700 --> 08:37.767
(calm music playing)

08:41.900 --> 08:44.667
Well, that about concludes
the first meeting

08:44.734 --> 08:47.133
of the hunk-a hunk-a
burnin' love fan club.

08:47.200 --> 08:52.500
But before we adjourn, our secretary
has a real special surprise...

08:53.000 --> 08:56.200
a genuine Elvis artifact.

08:56.266 --> 09:00.066
(everybody gasps)

09:00.133 --> 09:02.400
It's a partially-eaten pork chop.

09:06.066 --> 09:08.100
He had beautiful teeth, didn't he?

09:08.166 --> 09:09.500
Wonderful.

09:15.633 --> 09:17.934
This has to be a fake.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.266
Elvis would never have
left this much meat on a pork chop.

09:21.333 --> 09:27.834
(laughing)

09:32.967 --> 09:34.567
Dorothy, you're out of the club.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.266
Meeting is adjourned. Thank you, ladies.

09:37.333 --> 09:40.233
See you next week. Thank you for coming.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.934
Well, I hope you're not
too upset over this, Dorothy.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.700
I've just been thrown out
of an unauthorized Elvis fan club.

09:51.066 --> 09:54.467
I'll try to pick up the pieces
and go on with my life.

09:57.834 --> 10:00.567
I mean, there must be a support group
for people like me.

10:05.433 --> 10:08.567
We're sorry, Dorothy,
but the bylaws clearly state

10:08.633 --> 10:13.133
that any derogatory remarks about the king
are grounds for immediate expulsion.

10:13.967 --> 10:16.367
Maybe you ought to join an organization

10:16.433 --> 10:18.700
that is a little less
fanatical in its devotion.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.834
Like what, Blanche? The PLO?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.467
Know what I hate doing most after a party?

10:28.533 --> 10:31.033
Trying to find your underwear
in the big pile?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.333
(dishes clattering)

10:40.400 --> 10:43.066
Cleaning up the dirty dishes...

10:43.467 --> 10:44.633
you twit.

10:46.934 --> 10:50.533
Listen, let's leave this mess
and go out and get something to eat.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.767
I'll ask ma if she'd like to come.
She needs to get out.

10:54.834 --> 10:59.967
-She's been depressed since she returned.
-She lost her oldest friend.

11:00.033 --> 11:03.967
Even though she made up with Max,
she'll never see him again.

11:04.033 --> 11:09.333
We'll try to cheer her up.
We don't want her getting sick.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.834
No.

11:11.133 --> 11:14.200
-(Dorothy shouting) Ma! Oh, my God!
-Dorothy, what is it?

11:14.266 --> 11:15.266
What, honey?

11:16.433 --> 11:19.600
Oh! Good lord.

11:31.934 --> 11:34.200
Ma, what is going on here?

11:34.867 --> 11:36.066
Afterglow.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.967
-Nice to see you again.
-You, too. When did you get in?

11:51.333 --> 11:54.133
Oh, you mean in town. Yesterday.

11:54.934 --> 11:58.066
If you'd called,
I could've made you dinner

11:58.133 --> 12:01.233
-before you slept with mother!
-Dorothy.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.333
It's the most upsetting thing
you've ever done.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.867
I'm shocked. I'm disappointed.
I am speechless.

12:07.934 --> 12:10.266
-We're getting married.
-I'm very light-headed.

12:11.667 --> 12:16.166
(serene music playing)

12:17.567 --> 12:20.100
Dorothy. Dorothy!

12:20.600 --> 12:24.533
-Good. I think she's waking up.
-Oh, honey. Come on.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.834
-Are you all right?
-Oh.

12:27.367 --> 12:29.033
Oh, I'm fine, Rose.

12:29.767 --> 12:34.333
Oh, that was strange.
I've never fainted before.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.467
Me, neither.
What does it feel like afterward?

12:37.533 --> 12:38.767
Like this, Rose.

12:44.900 --> 12:49.333
It's time you explained
all this nonsense about getting married.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.567
-It's not nonsense.
-We're doing it right away.

12:52.633 --> 12:57.233
Look, Dorothy, I know you'll probably find
it hard to understand,

12:57.300 --> 13:01.500
but when I saw your mother again...
something happened.

13:01.567 --> 13:05.333
We talked, laughed, held hands...
we fell in love.

13:05.834 --> 13:08.333
Actually, we got a hot dog
before falling in love.

13:09.100 --> 13:12.100
The point is,
we're crazy about each other.

13:12.166 --> 13:17.367
If this turns out to be a mistake,
we'll probably be dead before we find out.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.266
Kiss me, you poet.

13:21.166 --> 13:25.000
-They are so cute together.
-Isn't it romantic?

13:25.066 --> 13:27.233
No, it isn't. It's ridiculous.

13:27.300 --> 13:31.500
This is the biggest mistake
you've ever made in your life.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.300
Fine.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.133
Don't come to the wedding.
Who wants you?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.800
Just remember one thing...

13:38.133 --> 13:41.133
if you want to send us a gift,
we're registered at Jordan marsh.

13:42.700 --> 13:48.867
(mellow music playing)

13:52.867 --> 13:55.900
-What are you doing?
-I'm sending Sophia's wedding invitations.

13:55.967 --> 13:59.066
Listen, forget about that.
Do you know what we need?

13:59.367 --> 14:01.100
An Elvis impersonator.

14:03.533 --> 14:04.834
Well, that sounds great.

14:04.900 --> 14:08.734
I thought we'd get a new dishwasher first.
This could probably come in just as handy.

14:10.867 --> 14:14.333
I mean for our next club meeting, Rose.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.533
Membership has been waning. Maybe this
will generate a little interest.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.667
-Oh, Blanche, that's a terrific idea.
-What's a terrific idea?

14:22.734 --> 14:25.367
Hiring an Elvis impersonator
for our next meeting.

14:25.433 --> 14:29.000
How would you pick
a good Elvis impersonator?

14:29.066 --> 14:31.734
Thump on his belly and see if he's ripe.

14:34.667 --> 14:37.367
How the hell should I know?
Why the hell should I care?

14:37.433 --> 14:39.533
You threw me out.

14:40.367 --> 14:45.133
I'll work on it after finishing the
invitations for you-know-who's wedding.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.900
Rose, I'd rather not
talk about ma's wedding.

14:49.166 --> 14:52.400
Don't you think it's time
you gave her your blessing?

14:52.467 --> 14:56.567
We've hired a caterer, ordered flowers,
we're even sending out invitations.

14:56.633 --> 15:00.867
I can't give my blessing.
She's hated him for 40 years.

15:00.934 --> 15:05.166
Suddenly, after a three-day weekend,
she decides to get married.

15:05.233 --> 15:08.133
I can't believe someone
falls in love that quickly.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.467
My Charlie proposed to me
10 minutes after we met.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.433
Of course, we were only 7.

15:16.066 --> 15:21.166
My mother was so cute when I told her.
She said, "You're just a little girl.

15:21.233 --> 15:24.667
You have your entire life before you
and the world to see.

15:24.734 --> 15:27.900
Wait until you grow up
and get sophisticated

15:27.967 --> 15:30.800
and marry at 15 like your sisters."

15:32.834 --> 15:33.967
But you didn't.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.734
No. I was always kind of
the gypsy of the family.

15:38.233 --> 15:39.400
The rebel.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.867
I wanted to see the world,

15:44.934 --> 15:49.000
so after high school, I went to St. Gustav
university to study Latin.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.166
I didn't know you studied Latin.

15:53.667 --> 15:56.700
First in my class, orothy-day.

16:05.700 --> 16:09.500
-Well, what do you think?
-Sophia, that looks beautiful.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.500
It's absolutely gorgeous.

16:11.567 --> 16:14.467
Don't you have to be a virgin
to wear a white dress?

16:14.967 --> 16:18.934
The last time I was virgin,
the Louisiana purchase was in escrow.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.467
It doesn't matter anyway.
Nobody will see this.

16:24.533 --> 16:27.000
-What do you mean?
-According to Sicilian custom,

16:27.066 --> 16:29.734
I can't marry unless I have
you-know-who's blessing.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.667
-Who?
-Dick Clark.

16:34.266 --> 16:35.567
Dorothy, you idiot.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.400
Dorothy, your mother's talking to you.

16:41.934 --> 16:45.567
I spoke to your aunt Regina
in Sicily this morning

16:45.633 --> 16:46.800
to tell her about the wedding.

16:46.867 --> 16:51.967
She said I'll have bad luck unless
I have the blessing of my eldest daughter

16:52.033 --> 16:56.133
or my child with the most facial hair.
All arrows point to you.

16:59.066 --> 17:02.300
You know how I feel.
I cannot give you my blessing.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.900
I love you, but if
you ruin my happiness,

17:05.967 --> 17:09.934
I'll put a Sicilian curse
on you that's hell on earth.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.433
Ma, you can't put a Sicilian curse
on your eldest daughter

17:14.500 --> 17:18.467
if the mother is marrying a man
under 5'7".

17:20.734 --> 17:23.433
You're not the only one
with aunt Regina's phone number.

17:26.700 --> 17:27.900
Damn MCI!

17:29.133 --> 17:36.033
(serene music playing)

17:36.900 --> 17:40.600
-Sophia? Sophia?
-Sophia?

17:42.700 --> 17:45.033
Where did she go?
The wedding's about to start.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.300
(toilet flushes)

17:47.700 --> 17:50.200
-Is that you, Sophia?
-No. It's Merlin Olsen.

17:50.266 --> 17:52.300
I'm watering my forget-me-not bouquet.

17:53.533 --> 17:55.600
Honey, we've come to help you get ready.

17:56.066 --> 17:57.233
The wedding is off.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.633
-What's going on? Where's Sophia?
-She's locked herself in.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.433
She has prewedding jitters.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.266
Sophia? It's me, Max.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.567
Now, what's all this nonsense
about not wanting to get married?

18:11.133 --> 18:14.166
Max, I love you with all my heart.

18:14.433 --> 18:18.433
The time we've spent together
has been wonderful.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.633
But Dorothy might be right.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.633
Maybe it's not possible
to fall in love quickly.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.633
Maybe it's not possible at all at our age.

18:27.133 --> 18:31.800
But it felt like it the other night
when we walked along the beach

18:31.867 --> 18:36.333
and you said, "Look up
at that beautiful moon.

18:36.800 --> 18:42.433
I'd like to throw a lasso around it
and give it to you. I love you so."

18:42.500 --> 18:46.967
-And I said, "Darling--"
-Ma, stop. Stop.

18:48.133 --> 18:49.967
Ma, listen, I have to talk to you.

18:50.033 --> 18:53.934
-Who's in charge here?
-Well, what's the problem?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.867
I'm the caterer. It's 2:00.
The guests are waiting.

18:56.934 --> 18:58.667
What's wrong?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.967
-I know you're there.
-The wedding's off.

19:02.033 --> 19:05.433
-She doesn't approve.
-She doesn't approve?

19:05.834 --> 19:07.333
Now, look here, stretch.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.066
I have 100 cheese puffs
and a sensitive assistant

19:14.133 --> 19:16.333
both on the verge of collapse.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.867
Whatever the problem is, overlook it.

19:19.934 --> 19:21.400
My mother did with my marriage.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.467
Say something smart,
and I'll slap you silly.

19:30.433 --> 19:34.567
Listen, this is a private moment,
so butt out, Rambo.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.934
Ma, I have a confession to make.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.433
I came here to beg you not to get married.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.400
I didn't want you and Max together.
It looked like you were cheating on pop.

19:49.467 --> 19:54.300
It doesn't make any sense,
but I still think of you two as married.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.100
I didn't want Max taking pop's place.

19:57.166 --> 20:03.333
But now that I see you're so much in love,
I realize I was being selfish.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.033
Ma, I want you to be happy.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.033
And I know pop would, too.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.200
I love you, pussycat.

20:29.333 --> 20:34.667
This is more moving than Susan Hayward's
climactic speech in <i>I Want to Live.</i>

20:36.400 --> 20:39.000
You're ready to fly right out of here,
aren't you?

20:42.467 --> 20:45.333
Well, excuse me for living, Anita Bryant.

20:48.467 --> 20:51.934
Couldn't we get married
so I can start hugging?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.967
-Places!
-Sophia, honey, I want to wish you

20:55.033 --> 20:58.533
-all the happiness in the world.
-Thank you, Blanche.

20:58.600 --> 21:03.967
And, Sophia, I want to offer you a
traditional Scandinavian wedding blessing.

21:04.667 --> 21:07.633
<i>Geflectaflauffin. Fleffin fluffin.</i>

21:08.467 --> 21:11.233
<i>Feffeta flingin. Fuflaffen.</i>

21:13.066 --> 21:14.133
I'm really touched.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.700
I'm also soaking wet.

21:19.867 --> 21:23.200
All right, one group hug,
and let's hit the road.

21:23.266 --> 21:26.066
Oh, sweetie. Honey.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.600
-Ohh.
-Oh.

21:29.633 --> 21:36.233
(wedding march plays)

21:56.900 --> 21:58.166
Uh-oh.

21:59.133 --> 22:01.867
Either I mixed the Elvis list
with the wedding list,

22:01.934 --> 22:05.367
or everyone in Max's family
appeared on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

22:07.934 --> 22:10.000
Who cares, already? Let's just do it.

22:13.100 --> 22:17.266
We are gathered here today to join this
man and this woman in matrimony.

22:17.333 --> 22:20.433
-I just love weddings.
-Me, too.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.567
Think you'll ever marry again?

22:22.867 --> 22:25.734
-Oh, I don't know. I don't think so.
-Me, neither.

22:26.133 --> 22:28.533
-How about you, Blanche?
-Oh, absolutely.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.166
If the right man ever came along.

22:31.233 --> 22:36.033
He'd have to have the body of Mel Gibson,
the personality of Johnny Carson,

22:36.100 --> 22:38.567
and the financial resources
of Donald Trump.

22:39.367 --> 22:43.633
I think the three of us
will be together a long time.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.433
And do you, Max, take Sophia
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

22:47.800 --> 22:48.867
I do.

22:49.166 --> 22:52.533
If no Elvis in this room
objects to this union...

22:52.967 --> 22:56.100
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
