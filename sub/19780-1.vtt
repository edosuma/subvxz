00:03.037 --> 00:03.717
Charlie, come back to me.

00:03.767 --> 00:05.257
One more time. All clear.

00:05.259 --> 00:07.192
Alex, please!

00:07.194 --> 00:08.893
I will stay away from him,
I swear.

00:08.895 --> 00:11.729
Just please, please, please,
please, let him live.

00:11.731 --> 00:14.666
'Cause you've brought me
back to life. Twice now, right?

00:14.716 --> 00:16.300
They're probably at
the Fellowship Awards.

00:17.269 --> 00:17.769
Tonight, we honor two of our own.

00:17.771 --> 00:20.504
Doctors Maggie Lin and Alex Reid.

00:20.506 --> 00:23.107
Nothing bad is gonna happen,
because I've got your back.

00:23.109 --> 00:25.777
Hey. You broke your promise.

00:25.779 --> 00:28.011
It's time to pay up.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:37.022 --> 00:39.590
- Can you tell me your name?
- Alex Reid.

00:39.592 --> 00:41.858
And where you?
What happened tonight?

00:41.860 --> 00:45.195
It was an award ceremony
for surgeons, and I'm...

00:45.197 --> 00:47.965
A man tried to shoot my... I...

00:47.967 --> 00:49.332
I have to go. I...

00:49.334 --> 00:51.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
You took a fall.

00:51.269 --> 00:53.203
Repeat these numbers for me,
please. 7...

00:53.205 --> 00:55.538
No, no, no.
I have to find him.

01:00.278 --> 01:03.113
Alex? Alex?

01:03.115 --> 01:04.313
Hey. Charlie...
have you seen him?

01:04.316 --> 01:05.548
- No.
- No. Are you okay?

01:05.550 --> 01:07.850
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:10.088 --> 01:11.454
Zach, have you seen him?

01:11.456 --> 01:13.423
Yeah, yeah. He's over there.
He's back there.

01:13.425 --> 01:16.291
Oh, my God. Charlie?

01:16.293 --> 01:17.793
- Charlie?
- Alex.

01:17.795 --> 01:20.562
Oh, my God.

01:22.533 --> 01:24.233
How come nobody's with you?

01:24.235 --> 01:25.835
Oh, I sent Zach away.

01:25.837 --> 01:27.870
It's okay. I'm okay.
The bullet went right through.

01:27.872 --> 01:29.304
And Crenshaw?

01:29.306 --> 01:31.440
He's, uh, he's dead, Alex.
Cops got him.

01:31.442 --> 01:33.475
- Oh, my God.
- He's gone.

01:33.477 --> 01:35.377
This is not how I imagined
the night going.

01:35.379 --> 01:37.112
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:37.114 --> 01:40.549
I had some...some big plans
for after the dinner.

01:40.551 --> 01:42.951
Oh, yeah?
What are you talkin' about?

01:42.953 --> 01:45.254
Well, let's just say the, uh,

01:45.256 --> 01:47.322
rose petal-covered suite
at the Fairmont's

01:47.324 --> 01:50.591
gonna make someone from
housekeeping very, very angry.

01:50.593 --> 01:52.627
Charlie.

01:52.629 --> 01:55.664
Surprise.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.398
Oh...

01:57.400 --> 02:00.802
You know what?
I was gonna...

02:00.804 --> 02:02.303
do this another time,

02:02.305 --> 02:04.072
- but it's been quite a night.
- What are you doing?

02:04.074 --> 02:07.107
And, uh, why not?

02:07.109 --> 02:10.610
Can you, uh,
can you hold that for me?

02:10.613 --> 02:13.347
Here.

02:13.349 --> 02:15.216
You know, I've been...

02:15.218 --> 02:17.552
wanting to do this
for a long time, Alex.

02:24.493 --> 02:26.493
You're all I've ever wanted.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.934
Doctor? I am so sorry, excuse me.

02:33.936 --> 02:37.171
My name's Grace. I was working and...

02:37.173 --> 02:40.006
I saw you win your award. Congratulations.

02:40.008 --> 02:42.075
Thank you. Um...

02:42.077 --> 02:43.410
Aren't you... are you okay?

02:43.412 --> 02:45.579
Yeah, yeah, I'm freaked...
I'm a little freaked out.

02:45.581 --> 02:48.848
Yeah, no.
Well, you know, maybe.

02:48.850 --> 02:50.149
I need a subway.

02:50.151 --> 02:51.818
If you could just point me
towards the subway.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.521
Sure. Um, Grace are you sure
that you're okay?

02:54.523 --> 02:56.689
- I just wanna go home.
- You seem like...

02:56.691 --> 02:58.024
I don't feel great.

02:58.026 --> 02:59.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

03:00.661 --> 03:02.228
Okay, okay, Grace.
Just lay down, all right?

03:02.230 --> 03:03.763
- All right, Grace?
- I don't feel great. I wanna go home.

03:03.765 --> 03:06.432
Okay, Grace. Okay.

03:06.434 --> 03:07.900
Gunshot wound!

03:07.902 --> 03:09.401
We need some help over here!

03:09.403 --> 03:11.604
Oh, this is good. I'll just stay here.

03:11.606 --> 03:13.672
Stay with us, stay with us.

03:13.674 --> 03:15.040
Left side, lower rib cage.

03:15.042 --> 03:16.275
9th, maybe 10th interspace.

03:16.277 --> 03:17.643
Probably hit the intercostal artery.

03:17.645 --> 03:18.977
We gotta stop this bleed.

03:18.979 --> 03:20.412
This'll have to do. Sorry, Grace.

03:20.414 --> 03:22.715
Let's get her in the bus!

03:22.717 --> 03:24.383
Here we go, Grace.

03:24.385 --> 03:25.984
Oh, please don't leave me.

03:25.986 --> 03:30.421
That's not really a possibility
right now. Let's go, let's go!

03:30.423 --> 03:31.790
Charlie?

03:31.792 --> 03:33.524
I'll be fine. Get out of here. Go.

03:33.526 --> 03:34.926
Let's go, let's go!

03:39.099 --> 03:40.832
Stay with me, Grace.
All right, honey?

03:40.834 --> 03:43.201
Listen to my voice. We're gonna
take good care of you.

03:43.203 --> 03:45.737
- Pressure's dropping. Push ringers.
- I'm on it.

03:45.739 --> 03:48.273
When people said that catering
was a shitty job,

03:48.275 --> 03:49.907
they weren't kidding.

03:49.909 --> 03:52.076
Okay, oxygen. Come on, where is it?

03:52.078 --> 03:54.812
Grace, I need you to stop
talking and breathe, all right?

03:54.814 --> 03:57.415
Just breathe for me.
That's all you gotta go.

03:57.417 --> 04:00.485
You know, this is funny.
My mother...

04:00.487 --> 04:02.253
All right, all right,
we'll contact her right away.

04:02.255 --> 04:04.488
Just keep this on, all right?
That's all you have to do.

04:04.490 --> 04:06.523
Just breathe and listen to my voice.

04:06.525 --> 04:07.724
How we doing?

04:07.726 --> 04:09.593
Seriously. I am so unlucky.

04:09.595 --> 04:11.796
Grace, look at me.
Look at me, honey. Look at me.

04:11.798 --> 04:14.431
I don't believe in luck. Okay?

04:15.567 --> 04:16.934
Okay, Grace, we're here.

04:16.935 --> 04:18.233
We're gonna lower you down, all right?

04:18.236 --> 04:19.935
Everything is going to be okay.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.741
Come on, let's go! There's no time.

04:24.743 --> 04:27.311
You're gonna be all right, okay?
We've got you.

04:28.781 --> 04:30.146
Mag. That was quick.

04:30.148 --> 04:32.248
We were right behind you.
What's going on?

04:32.250 --> 04:34.851
28-year-old female, GSW,
left axillary line.

04:34.853 --> 04:36.519
- Can you run a FAST?
- Yeah.

04:36.521 --> 04:38.288
How's Charlie?

04:38.290 --> 04:41.557
He's okay. I can't think about
that right now.

04:41.559 --> 04:43.827
All right, Grace, I'm gonna need
you to calm down, all right?

04:43.829 --> 04:45.361
Calm down for me. Take a breath.

04:45.363 --> 04:47.396
I'm gonna take my finger out
and put a stitch in this.

04:47.398 --> 04:49.866
3, 2, 1... go.

04:49.868 --> 04:52.802
Extraocular movement is normal.
Reflexes are brisk.

04:52.804 --> 04:57.172
Okay, fluid in the pericardial
and peritoneal cavity.

04:57.174 --> 05:01.877
There it is. Bullet is resting
right by the aorta.

05:01.879 --> 05:05.314
Grace, honey, focus on me, okay?
Look at me.

05:05.316 --> 05:06.816
There you go.

05:06.818 --> 05:08.483
I like that tattoo. Tell me about it.

05:08.485 --> 05:12.520
What is so special about
February 7th, huh?

05:12.522 --> 05:14.422
That's the first time I got shot.

05:14.424 --> 05:19.995
That's why it's so funny.

05:28.559 --> 05:31.324
"February 7, 2014."

05:31.326 --> 05:34.760
"Rival gang members open fire
in a busy commuter walkway."

05:34.762 --> 05:36.796
I know, and almost killed
Charlie and I in the process.

05:36.798 --> 05:39.765
Alex, you and Grace were
at the same random shootings

05:39.767 --> 05:41.234
two years apart.

05:41.236 --> 05:42.868
Talk about a connection.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.770
It's actually... It's creepy.

05:44.772 --> 05:46.672
Let's prep her for an emergency lap

05:46.674 --> 05:48.307
and hope like hell there's
no damage to her colon.

05:48.309 --> 05:51.343
Yeah, not to mention her spleen,
pancreas, and stomach...

05:51.345 --> 05:54.747
Holy hell. Is that a ring?

05:54.749 --> 05:56.315
Uh, yes. Another time, my friend.

05:56.317 --> 05:59.418
Can you prep her for surgery?
I gotta talk to the mother.

06:04.158 --> 06:05.924
Mrs. Summerville?

06:05.926 --> 06:07.826
- Yes. Are you the doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

06:07.828 --> 06:09.094
Where's my daughter?

06:09.096 --> 06:10.562
She's been brought up
to an operating room.

06:10.564 --> 06:12.631
She's okay, right? I mean,
she's going to be okay?

06:12.633 --> 06:14.500
Well, she is in serious condition.

06:14.502 --> 06:15.734
Why don't you have a seat?

06:15.736 --> 06:17.869
No, I'm good. I just... just tell me.

06:17.871 --> 06:19.871
Okay, well, Grace has suffered
a gunshot wound.

06:19.873 --> 06:21.873
And the bullet has caused
damage in her abdomen.

06:21.875 --> 06:24.009
The bullet. Another bullet.

06:25.646 --> 06:27.145
You know, honestly, when I got the call,

06:27.147 --> 06:28.880
I thought it was some kind of sick joke.

06:28.882 --> 06:31.149
You and your daughter seem to
have the same sense of humor.

06:31.151 --> 06:34.552
Um...

06:34.554 --> 06:36.554
I need a priest.

06:36.556 --> 06:38.088
- A priest?
- Yeah. A priest.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.690
I mean, I can't go through this again.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.259
There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...

06:41.261 --> 06:42.726
Yes, of course. I'll find someone.

06:42.728 --> 06:44.328
She didn't deserve this, okay?

06:44.330 --> 06:46.130
- Any of it. She's...
- No. No. No one does.

06:46.132 --> 06:47.632
As soon as we know anything, all right?

06:47.634 --> 06:48.999
Okay.

06:49.001 --> 06:51.101
If you'll excuse me. How's he doing?

06:51.103 --> 06:53.570
If glass is made from sand,
how come you can see through it?

06:53.572 --> 06:55.405
How much morphine did you give him?

06:55.407 --> 06:57.407
- All of it.
- Hey, baby.

06:57.409 --> 06:58.575
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:58.577 --> 07:00.077
I've got Sekara running triage.

07:00.079 --> 07:01.411
It's not really filling me with confidence.

07:01.413 --> 07:03.647
- You got him?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah. We're good.

07:03.649 --> 07:05.115
Okay, as soon as imaging opens up,

07:05.117 --> 07:07.084
- we'll get him right in there.
- See if I have any fractures.

07:07.086 --> 07:08.618
I'm more worried about your spirits.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.086
Oh, when the spirits are willing, maybe,

07:10.088 --> 07:11.221
but the flesh is weak.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.855
Charlie, seriously, is there anybody here

07:12.857 --> 07:14.324
that we need to worry about?

07:14.326 --> 07:16.959
No. No, uh, no Crenshaws in the house.

07:16.961 --> 07:19.028
But, um, I'm okay, 'cause I got
a morphine drip.

07:19.030 --> 07:20.530
I got my ex-wife waiting on me hand and foot.

07:20.532 --> 07:22.131
And Jackson's bringing me nachos.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.234
I'm all good. You go save that girl.

07:24.236 --> 07:26.435
Right. Crap, it's the sitter.

07:26.437 --> 07:28.071
She saw the news and she's freaking out.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.839
- I'll... I'll call her.
- No, no, no, no, I'll do it.

07:29.841 --> 07:31.407
You just try to stay in
this dimension, okay?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.608
Okay, before you do anything,

07:32.610 --> 07:33.976
I want you to stop by the lab and make sure

07:33.978 --> 07:35.778
those Fellowship cocktails are
out of your system, okay?

07:35.780 --> 07:37.914
Of course.

07:37.916 --> 07:41.350
Call the sitter, pee in a cup, find a priest.

07:43.887 --> 07:44.986
- Williams.
- Hey.

07:44.988 --> 07:46.655
- Oh, you came back in.
- Oh.

07:46.657 --> 07:47.823
Oh, great, great.

07:47.825 --> 07:49.091
I came back in as soon as I heard.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.126
Yeah. Oh, good. You know, hey.

07:51.128 --> 07:52.961
You get to stand around with the rest of us

07:52.963 --> 07:54.230
worried schmucks, right?

07:54.232 --> 07:55.631
You know, human component aside,

07:55.633 --> 07:58.133
would've been helpful if a few
more people got shot.

07:58.135 --> 08:00.268
What? No. I'm not talking
about a bloodbath...

08:00.270 --> 08:02.204
- Dr. Kinney.
- No, I just...

08:02.206 --> 08:04.672
God, I was kidding. Right? Joking.

08:04.674 --> 08:06.608
It was just that we all came
running back in to help

08:06.610 --> 08:08.110
and there's nothing to do.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.378
Bed 3. Guy's been waiting
for a plastics consult

08:10.380 --> 08:12.480
- for over an hour.
- Thank you, Storms,

08:12.482 --> 08:13.982
for being the slowest surgeon
on the planet.

08:13.984 --> 08:15.983
Come on, let's go. We're up.

08:15.985 --> 08:19.387
25-year-old Dustin... Meyer.

08:19.389 --> 08:21.289
Hey, Dustin.

08:21.291 --> 08:24.024
You can call me Dr. Dustiny.

08:24.026 --> 08:26.994
Um... yeah, that's not gonna happen.

08:26.996 --> 08:29.264
You wanna tell us what you did?

08:29.266 --> 08:31.165
Fell off the stage.

08:31.167 --> 08:33.500
Oh. Ow. Um...

08:33.501 --> 08:36.503
let's take a look here, shall we?

08:40.042 --> 08:42.076
So, Dustin, you're a...

08:42.078 --> 08:43.443
dancer?

08:43.445 --> 08:45.880
Stripper. Yeah. Down at Lumberjaxxx.

08:45.882 --> 08:48.081
And that's with, uh, three X's.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.650
Yeah.

08:49.652 --> 08:51.752
Looks like a subcutaneous

08:51.754 --> 08:53.887
extrusion of an implant through the fascia.

08:53.889 --> 08:55.255
What does that mean?

08:55.257 --> 08:56.923
What-what happened to my ass?

08:56.925 --> 09:00.260
Um, the force of the impact
caused a fascial tear,

09:00.262 --> 09:03.630
and your gluteal implant herniated.

09:03.632 --> 09:06.732
Your, uh, your-your fake butt flipped.

09:06.734 --> 09:11.337
So, just... unflip it.

09:13.909 --> 09:16.976
What? You-you guys can fix this, right?

09:16.978 --> 09:19.378
Blood work all checks out.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.913
Looks like you dodged a bullet.

09:22.583 --> 09:25.117
You know what I mean. You're gonna be fine.

09:25.119 --> 09:27.420
It's not me I'm worried about. It's that girl.

09:29.123 --> 09:30.756
Could you get that for me?
That could be the sitter.

09:35.396 --> 09:36.662
Other pocket.

09:38.165 --> 09:40.098
Other pocket.

09:45.072 --> 09:47.906
Charlie Harris' phone.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.475
You won a cruise.

09:50.477 --> 09:52.177
Hang up.

09:52.179 --> 09:54.312
What? It could be a great honeymoon.

09:54.314 --> 09:56.314
Better than that disastrous one

09:56.316 --> 09:58.082
that we spent at Niagara Falls

09:58.084 --> 10:01.653
with that heart-shaped bed
that wouldn't stop vibrating.

10:03.890 --> 10:06.858
Well, I guess it did distract us
from the ant problem.

10:09.830 --> 10:12.563
So the suspense is killing me.
What did she say?

10:12.565 --> 10:15.566
We didn't get that far.

10:20.039 --> 10:23.241
You're worried she's gonna say no.

10:23.243 --> 10:25.276
You are such a guy, Charlie...

10:25.278 --> 10:27.210
in a good way.

10:27.212 --> 10:29.346
She's gonna say yes.

10:29.348 --> 10:32.182
Yeah, what makes you say that?

10:32.184 --> 10:35.519
Because I've seen the way
that she looks at you and...

10:35.521 --> 10:37.120
I know that look.

10:37.122 --> 10:39.356
Dawn?

10:39.358 --> 10:41.958
What?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.460
I can't feel my hand.

10:53.505 --> 10:55.372
Oh, come on.

10:55.374 --> 10:57.908
"Back in 20"? Damn it!

10:57.910 --> 11:00.643
Hey, hey. Excuse me.

11:00.645 --> 11:02.678
You do know you're in a chapel, right?

11:02.680 --> 11:05.214
Yeah, sorry. I was looking
for the hospital chaplain.

11:05.216 --> 11:06.682
Have you seen him?

11:06.684 --> 11:09.819
Uh, no. And good luck with that,
'cause I'm here all the time

11:09.821 --> 11:11.554
and I've yet to meet the man, so...

11:11.556 --> 11:13.923
- Great.
- What was your name?

11:13.925 --> 11:15.691
Alex Reid.

11:15.693 --> 11:17.893
Emmanuel Palmer.

11:17.895 --> 11:20.762
Vascular. Endovascular.
Interventional radiology.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.132
I heard about the shooting, so I...

11:23.134 --> 11:24.666
So you came here to pray.

11:24.668 --> 11:27.869
But before I became a doctor
I was, uh, in the seminary.

11:27.871 --> 11:29.504
So you're a priest?

11:29.506 --> 11:32.641
Uh, a failed one. I dropped out.

11:32.643 --> 11:33.875
Close enough. Come with me.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.577
Why'd you drop out of the seminary?

11:35.579 --> 11:37.846
Uh, long story.

11:37.848 --> 11:39.915
Whose pee is that?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.884
That's her.

11:42.886 --> 11:46.254
Yeah. Can kinda tell by
the thousand-yard stare.

11:46.256 --> 11:49.123
Oh, Jackson. You headed to the lab?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.358
With bells on, Dr. Reid.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.160
- Put a rush on this for me.
- Okay.

11:52.162 --> 11:53.828
Mrs. Summerville: I just need her to be okay.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.830
I'll sit with her, do what I can.

11:55.832 --> 11:57.432
She's in good hands, okay?

11:57.434 --> 11:59.167
So it doesn't matter if she's awake, right?

11:59.169 --> 12:01.535
I mean, it still counts? She'll be absolved?

12:01.537 --> 12:03.637
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

12:03.639 --> 12:05.340
Uh, Ruth here has asked me

12:05.342 --> 12:07.107
to deliver Last Rites to her daughter.

12:07.109 --> 12:09.944
Ruth, why do you think she's gonna die?

12:09.946 --> 12:12.913
Because she's cursed, and I-I wanna be sure.

12:12.915 --> 12:15.649
- You're gonna do it, right?
- We're not there yet, Ruth.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.150
- Okay, you don't understand...
- I promise you.

12:17.152 --> 12:19.520
If things don't go well in that surgery,

12:19.522 --> 12:21.121
there will be time for that.

12:21.123 --> 12:22.522
But right now I'm gonna go in that room,

12:22.524 --> 12:24.458
and I'm gonna save your daughter's life.

12:27.429 --> 12:29.696
So your implant is hidden
in the gluteal crust.

12:29.698 --> 12:31.798
Sounds like something you get at Pizza Hut.

12:32.744 --> 12:35.067
Which means, unfortunately,
until the swelling goes down,

12:35.070 --> 12:37.371
we're not able to operate
on you, Dustin, so...

12:37.373 --> 12:39.572
No. Nobody calls me Dustin.

12:39.574 --> 12:42.408
Well, I'm not calling you "Doctor."

12:42.410 --> 12:44.076
Look, why don't you go home, sit on some ice?

12:44.078 --> 12:46.012
When everything settles, you come back in,

12:46.014 --> 12:47.346
we'll repair the implant.

12:47.348 --> 12:49.281
Yeah, but how long until I get my butt back?

12:49.283 --> 12:51.083
It could be several weeks.

12:51.085 --> 12:54.286
- No dancing, obviously.
- Dude.

12:54.288 --> 12:55.821
Guys...

12:55.823 --> 12:58.124
Dancing's all I've got.

12:58.126 --> 13:00.326
No show, no dough. You have
no idea what it's gonna be like

13:00.328 --> 13:02.094
to be sidelined for so long.

13:02.096 --> 13:03.462
No, actually, Dr. Kinney is coming off

13:03.464 --> 13:05.998
of a leave of absence herself, so...

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Sorry. Not in your stars.

13:09.337 --> 13:12.871
Hey. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Just, um...

13:12.873 --> 13:14.205
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

13:14.207 --> 13:15.641
Um, Dr. Kinney...

13:15.643 --> 13:18.476
I have never understood
the appeal of strip clubs, you?

13:18.752 --> 13:20.286
- I...
- You know, apparently,

13:20.336 --> 13:21.779
some of them actually serve food.

13:21.782 --> 13:24.182
Can you imagine? I mean,
$10.99 for a steak sandwich

13:24.184 --> 13:25.717
and a face dance?

13:25.719 --> 13:29.354
There is not enough
hand sanitizer in the world.

13:29.356 --> 13:32.323
Uh... What? Everything-everything okay?

13:32.325 --> 13:34.592
Yeah. Yeah.

13:34.594 --> 13:36.428
No. Were we thorough enough in there?

13:36.430 --> 13:38.896
We didn't exactly run through
the checklist manifesto.

13:38.898 --> 13:41.533
Keep it in your pants, Williams.

13:43.403 --> 13:47.137
Book him a follow-up in
three weeks and discharge him.

13:47.139 --> 13:49.473
And, you know, next time
you get the urge to share

13:49.475 --> 13:51.442
a personal tidbit of mine
with a patient,

13:51.444 --> 13:54.645
do me a favor... don't.

13:58.384 --> 14:00.517
Can I get more suction?
I could really use my eyes here.

14:00.519 --> 14:02.386
More suction here, too.

14:02.388 --> 14:04.721
Amazing she was walking around after being shot.

14:04.723 --> 14:06.856
Bullet must've only grazed the aorta.

14:06.858 --> 14:09.025
There's just minor bleeding
from the gastrocolic vessels.

14:09.027 --> 14:10.694
First bit of luck this girl's had.

14:10.696 --> 14:13.097
Yeah. Long Metz.

14:13.099 --> 14:15.232
I'm gonna incise the reptroperitoneum

14:15.234 --> 14:16.500
and find that bullet.

14:18.070 --> 14:20.070
Whoa! Bleeder!

14:20.072 --> 14:22.238
Spoke too soon. There must be
a tear in the aorta.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.407
Reptroperitoneum must've been
tamponading the injury.

14:24.409 --> 14:25.609
Until we opened her up.

14:25.611 --> 14:26.843
- Doctor Sharpe!
- Already on it.

14:26.845 --> 14:28.011
Pushing more blood.

14:28.013 --> 14:29.879
Can somebody get that?

14:29.881 --> 14:33.382
I'll need an aortic clamp and a 4-0.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.151
- - Dr. Reid?
What?

14:35.153 --> 14:36.752
The lab. You're clear to operate.

14:36.754 --> 14:38.321
- Oh, good thing.
- Screw that bullet.

14:38.323 --> 14:40.289
I'm gonna cross clamp
the aorta at the diaphragm.

14:40.291 --> 14:41.790
Give us more time to find the tear.

14:41.792 --> 14:43.326
And then suture it closed.
But once I cut off

14:43.328 --> 14:44.760
the blood supply,
she's got maybe five minutes

14:44.762 --> 14:46.162
before her other organs
shut down.

14:46.164 --> 14:48.531
- Five minutes?
- Clamp.

14:56.753 --> 14:58.848
Three minutes since the aorta's been clamped.

14:58.850 --> 15:00.216
No other bleeds that I can see.

15:00.218 --> 15:02.584
That's what I like to hear.
Where is it?

15:02.586 --> 15:04.887
Come on.

15:04.889 --> 15:06.355
Come on!

15:06.357 --> 15:08.590
There it is above the left renal artery.

15:08.592 --> 15:10.359
Needle driver.

15:10.361 --> 15:12.761
Ready for the surgical version
of the 100-meter dash?

15:12.763 --> 15:14.496
- Whew.
- 1 minute 40 seconds left.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.431
So... about that ring.

15:16.433 --> 15:17.733
Not really a good time, Maggs.

15:17.735 --> 15:19.601
1 minute 34 seconds.

15:19.603 --> 15:20.902
Really not helping.

15:20.904 --> 15:22.971
Ah...

15:22.973 --> 15:25.940
And... we are done.

15:25.942 --> 15:29.210
With several seconds that I am
no longer counting to spare.

15:29.212 --> 15:30.912
Sutures look good from here.

15:30.914 --> 15:32.580
Let's get ready to ease off that clamp.

15:32.582 --> 15:34.448
Keep an eye out for any other bleeders.

15:34.450 --> 15:36.117
Preparing to remove clamp.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.521
Let's hold our breath, everyone.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.256
She may still have a leak.

15:42.258 --> 15:44.191
Come on, Grace.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.360
Holding.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.928
Oozing a bit, though.

15:47.930 --> 15:50.264
Dr. Sharpe, what's her Pro Time?

15:50.266 --> 15:51.932
Twice normal.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.501
That liver does look cirrhotic.

15:53.503 --> 15:55.436
She's at major risk for bleeding out.

15:55.438 --> 15:57.137
I need to go talk to the mother.

15:57.139 --> 15:59.539
Okay, I'll push clotting factors
and FFP like crazy.

15:59.541 --> 16:03.143
And when you get back, we're
gonna talk about that ring.

16:12.821 --> 16:15.388
Ruth?

16:15.390 --> 16:16.656
Grace is alive.

16:17.793 --> 16:19.292
But she is having trouble clotting.

16:19.294 --> 16:21.994
Does she have a liver disease
that you're aware of?

16:23.264 --> 16:25.732
She was born Hep C positive.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.133
It was because of me.

16:30.439 --> 16:33.539
I had her when I was 17.

16:33.541 --> 16:35.874
I was using whatever
I could get my hands on.

16:35.876 --> 16:38.411
You know, dirty needles.

16:40.148 --> 16:42.281
I gave her up.

16:42.283 --> 16:44.383
She had a good family.
They were good to her.

16:44.385 --> 16:45.952
They took care of her.

16:47.588 --> 16:48.754
And then I came back into her life,

16:48.756 --> 16:51.389
and I ruined everything.

16:51.391 --> 16:53.391
I'm sure that's not true.

16:54.628 --> 16:56.829
She found me a couple years ago.

16:56.831 --> 17:00.766
You know, one of
those agencies, and, uh...

17:00.768 --> 17:04.635
Right after we reconnected, she was shot.

17:04.637 --> 17:06.537
For the first time.

17:06.539 --> 17:09.906
Hey. Hey, that's just a coincidence.

17:09.909 --> 17:13.411
Every time. Every time we get close,

17:13.413 --> 17:14.945
something bad happens.

17:14.948 --> 17:16.982
Ruth, listen to me.

17:16.983 --> 17:19.483
Luck's not in charge here.

17:19.486 --> 17:22.353
I am.

17:22.355 --> 17:24.088
Next few hours are critical, and we're doing

17:24.089 --> 17:26.323
everything we can to manage her bleeding.

17:26.325 --> 17:28.993
Just hang in there
and you will see her, all right?

17:39.005 --> 17:41.438
Dr. Dustiny?

17:41.440 --> 17:43.573
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you?

17:43.575 --> 17:46.977
No, dude, it's cool. I was
just, uh, just resting my ass.

17:46.979 --> 17:48.612
Little drowsy, I guess.

17:48.614 --> 17:50.214
Your discharge papers.

17:50.216 --> 17:52.916
Ah, you're kicking me out of here already,

17:52.918 --> 17:54.551
with an ass like the Elephant Man.

17:54.553 --> 17:56.720
- Just until the...
- Swelling goes down.

17:56.722 --> 17:59.122
Yeah. I know. I know.

17:59.124 --> 18:01.057
I'll get you some crutches
before you head out.

18:02.961 --> 18:05.762
Dustin, have you been
using cocaine?

18:05.764 --> 18:08.899
What? Like recently?

18:08.901 --> 18:12.001
I'm not judging. Everything you
say in here is privileged.

18:13.271 --> 18:15.971
I just celebrated
five years sober.

18:15.973 --> 18:17.440
Never dance without it.

18:17.442 --> 18:19.675
It reminds me of messier times.

18:19.677 --> 18:21.177
Right.

18:21.179 --> 18:23.413
Could you have a cold, maybe?

18:23.415 --> 18:25.281
No. Strike two, Doc.

18:25.283 --> 18:27.650
In my line of work,
you become immune to everything.

18:27.652 --> 18:29.818
I'm like a kindergarten teacher.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.254
Except my classroom
is full of horny housewives

18:32.256 --> 18:34.423
- pelting money at me.
- Charming.

18:34.425 --> 18:35.524
Yeah.

18:35.526 --> 18:36.792
You don't ever feel exploited?

18:36.794 --> 18:39.494
No. Men can't be exploited.

18:39.496 --> 18:41.697
It's a scientific fact.

18:43.034 --> 18:46.435
You know, it's not just about the money.

18:46.437 --> 18:49.538
I like making people happy, always have.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.339
I think I'm pretty good at it, too.

18:51.341 --> 18:53.108
Oh.

18:53.110 --> 18:55.077
See?

18:56.346 --> 18:57.579
All right, I should boogie.

18:57.581 --> 18:59.114
I know what it's like
when someone's hogging

18:59.116 --> 19:00.615
the champagne room.

19:02.686 --> 19:04.285
Thanks.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.592
Oh. Ah...

19:10.594 --> 19:12.393
Dustin?

19:12.395 --> 19:14.929
Sorry, can you walk back towards me?

19:17.833 --> 19:20.334
You're zig-zagging.

19:20.336 --> 19:23.104
Okay, I need you to lay down
and, uh, tell me again

19:23.106 --> 19:26.107
exactly how you fell.

19:31.314 --> 19:34.648
Dr. Kinney? Your patient in 3,
can you move him out?

19:34.650 --> 19:35.949
I could use the bed.

19:35.951 --> 19:37.818
And by "I," I mean Dr. Miller.

19:37.820 --> 19:41.254
I would love to, but I don't
have a patient in 3.

19:41.256 --> 19:44.124
Your, uh, Magic Mike?

19:45.728 --> 19:47.694
I told Williams to discharge him.

19:47.696 --> 19:50.330
You did? Of course you did.

19:50.332 --> 19:51.998
Yes, 'cause, uh, she told me,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.066
and, uh, so I'll just go check...

19:54.068 --> 19:56.369
- I'll get back...
- Sekara, why are you walking backwards?

19:56.371 --> 19:58.804
Is your ass broken, too?

19:58.806 --> 20:00.473
- Hey. What's going on?
- I can explain.

20:00.475 --> 20:01.807
- Please.
- I was following a hunch,

20:01.809 --> 20:04.410
and I think Dr. Dustiny... I mean, Dustiny...

20:04.412 --> 20:07.613
Dustin... I think he has a skull fracture.

20:07.615 --> 20:09.749
When he fell off the stage,
he also fell onto his right ear,

20:09.751 --> 20:11.250
and his gait was affected.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.186
And the clear liquid coming from
his nose wasn't from drug use.

20:14.188 --> 20:16.588
- Brain fluid?
- Good catch, Cass.

20:16.590 --> 20:20.059
Well, I need to check with
Dr. Hamza to confirm, obviously.

20:20.061 --> 20:22.994
So? What are you waiting for?
Go follow your hunch.

20:29.303 --> 20:31.002
All right, Charlie.

20:31.004 --> 20:33.172
You have a bleed that is
increasing the pressure,

20:33.174 --> 20:34.540
cutting off the circulation to your arm.

20:34.542 --> 20:35.940
So what I'm going to have to do...

20:35.942 --> 20:37.276
You're going to thread the balloon

20:37.278 --> 20:38.710
through the catheter into my arm.

20:38.712 --> 20:41.146
Once you find the bleed,
you'll inflate the balloon,

20:41.148 --> 20:43.581
hope like hell the bleeding
stops... any questions?

20:43.583 --> 20:47.218
- Tough crowd.
- Forgot my audience for a second.

20:47.220 --> 20:49.287
Um, you know, you guys
need to top me up.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.122
This thing's really
starting to kill.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.792
Unfortunately, you are
maxed out, my friend.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.327
- I'd like a second opinion.
- He's right. No more meds.

20:56.329 --> 20:59.129
Well, you're no fun.
And you're not my friend.

20:59.131 --> 21:01.065
Charlie doesn't have
any friends.

21:01.067 --> 21:02.433
Thank you, Dawn.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.034
No, seriously, you guys,

21:04.036 --> 21:05.603
I'm-I'm in a lot of pain here.

21:05.605 --> 21:08.539
Have you tried mindful breathing, Charlie?

21:08.541 --> 21:11.342
Charlie's more of a old school kind of guy.

21:11.344 --> 21:13.510
Old school kind of guy?

21:14.613 --> 21:16.513
Well, old school, meet new school.

21:16.515 --> 21:19.549
This is what I call Zen surgery.

21:19.551 --> 21:20.884
Dawn.

21:20.886 --> 21:22.586
You won't even know I was here, Charlie.

21:22.588 --> 21:25.655
Like I was a-a ghost.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.761
The lights are getting brighter
and I don't know what to do.

21:31.763 --> 21:36.099
Well... well, don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

21:37.536 --> 21:39.269
Surgically speaking.

21:39.271 --> 21:41.471
Well, do I go towards them or run like hell?

21:41.473 --> 21:44.040
You stay away.

21:44.042 --> 21:46.642
Stay away from the carotid artery.

21:48.846 --> 21:51.647
Oh, God. Uh, Doc...

21:51.649 --> 21:53.349
Dr. Palmer?

21:53.351 --> 21:55.551
I'm having trouble
controlling the artery.

21:55.553 --> 21:57.319
I need to go towards the light.

21:57.321 --> 21:58.887
The bleed must be bigger
than we thought.

21:58.889 --> 22:00.556
We need to get him to the O.R. now.

22:00.558 --> 22:02.458
- You wait.
- No, I can't, Charlie.

22:02.460 --> 22:05.593
We don't get you to the O.R.
now, you may lose that arm.

22:11.849 --> 22:14.249
Doc.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.851
I'm a cardiac surgeon.

22:15.853 --> 22:18.186
I don't need a babysitter
for an arterial repair.

22:18.188 --> 22:19.454
I wouldn't dream of it.

22:19.456 --> 22:21.156
But another set of hands
and eyes never hurts, right?

22:21.158 --> 22:23.125
And why should those hands
and eyes belong to you?

22:23.127 --> 22:25.794
Just consider me your vascular parachute.

22:25.796 --> 22:27.595
Oh. No wonder I have you on nights.

22:27.597 --> 22:30.865
All right, so what's the plan?

22:30.867 --> 22:34.569
We find the bleed, sew it up,
save Charlie's arm.

22:34.571 --> 22:36.604
- And Plan "B"?
- There is no Plan "B."

22:36.606 --> 22:38.973
Plan "C" is you get too frisky
in there, I turf you.

22:40.977 --> 22:43.077
But how is there a Plan "C"
if there's no Plan "B"?

22:43.079 --> 22:44.679
Well, you've obviously never operated

22:44.681 --> 22:47.048
with the Chief of Surgery before.

22:47.050 --> 22:49.350
So was Nancy Drew right?

22:49.352 --> 22:52.519
No, you mean... Dr. Williams?

22:52.521 --> 22:54.188
- Yeah.
- Well, looks like you owe your resident

22:54.190 --> 22:55.389
a steak dinner.

22:55.391 --> 22:57.158
Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

22:57.160 --> 23:00.561
Oh. Then an expensive chickpea salad.

23:00.563 --> 23:02.830
Look, the fracture runs along
the anterior skull base

23:02.832 --> 23:05.499
- through his cribriform plate.
- And if I'd sent him home?

23:05.501 --> 23:07.734
He probably wouldn't have made
it to work Monday morning.

23:07.736 --> 23:09.736
Well, he doesn't work mornings.

23:09.738 --> 23:12.739
What? Just saying, he's a stripper.

23:12.741 --> 23:14.174
This scan is from Bed 3?

23:14.176 --> 23:15.776
Your-your patient in Bed 3?

23:15.778 --> 23:17.711
No, no. He needs an O.R. right away.

23:17.713 --> 23:20.146
Yeah, that's why we're here.
When can you operate?

23:20.148 --> 23:22.983
Me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

23:22.985 --> 23:26.719
My colleague, Dr. James...
he'll do the procedure.

23:26.721 --> 23:28.021
Mm-hmm.

23:29.824 --> 23:31.891
You know him.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.696
Well... back in the day,

23:36.698 --> 23:39.732
after Victor, before Jonathan,

23:39.734 --> 23:43.435
I was a committed patron
at his place of business.

23:43.437 --> 23:45.104
I just... I-I never had you pegged

23:45.106 --> 23:48.273
for a-a Lumberjaxxx kind of guy, Shahir.

23:48.275 --> 23:51.276
Hmm. Yeah. Dr. Dustiny.

23:51.278 --> 23:53.813
Due to his obvious assets...

23:53.815 --> 23:56.081
- and the whole doctor thing, that was...
- Mm-hmm.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.682
He was one of my favorites.

23:57.684 --> 23:59.618
You can still operate on him.

23:59.620 --> 24:02.521
No, no. No, I'm too close to this one.

24:02.523 --> 24:04.923
You operated on Charlie twice.

24:04.925 --> 24:06.425
Yeah, but that's different.

24:06.427 --> 24:09.361
What I got up to at Jaxxx,
it's not physically possible

24:09.363 --> 24:12.398
- to get any closer...
- O-okay, yeah. Just stop.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.700
Shahir, you're the right man for this job.

24:17.203 --> 24:21.406
Be his Shahiro, Dr. Hamza.

24:23.877 --> 24:27.278
Yes. Yes, I will do it.

24:27.280 --> 24:30.381
But, Dana, I'll fix his head,

24:30.383 --> 24:33.051
but you better save that ass.

24:33.053 --> 24:35.053
- Shahir.
- Hmm.

24:35.055 --> 24:36.654
You're hurting me.

24:39.092 --> 24:41.492
Okay, everybody get ready.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

24:41.494 --> 24:44.095
Should I, uh, be standing by with a mop?

24:46.299 --> 24:48.298
- Oh!
- Oh, okay!

24:48.300 --> 24:50.500
Uh, I wasn't commenting
on your technique,

24:50.502 --> 24:52.069
just the amount of blood loss.

24:52.071 --> 24:54.905
It's not that. It's-it's this arm.

24:58.978 --> 25:00.711
Okay, it's not a bigger bleed.

25:00.713 --> 25:04.247
It's a different pulsatile
bleed altogether. Sponges.

25:05.517 --> 25:07.584
More, more.

25:10.255 --> 25:13.056
I, uh, probably don't
want to see this.

25:13.058 --> 25:15.092
Yeah, me neither.

25:19.631 --> 25:22.364
There. Nice tux.

25:22.366 --> 25:25.802
Yeah. Guess I could say
the same thing for you.

25:25.804 --> 25:29.038
Mm. Clever Concoctions.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.473
Sorry?

25:30.475 --> 25:32.174
It's the catering company. They own it.

25:32.176 --> 25:33.309
Right.

25:33.311 --> 25:34.611
I can help you with that bow tie.

25:34.613 --> 25:36.345
Uh, you can't, actually.

25:36.347 --> 25:38.814
Trust me, I've tried. It's one of the many...

25:38.816 --> 25:41.016
...mysteries.

25:41.018 --> 25:43.586
Well, it looks cool like that, too.

25:43.588 --> 25:45.854
- It's very Clooney.
- Hmm.

25:45.856 --> 25:48.290
Like you're at the end
of a long wedding night.

25:48.292 --> 25:51.327
Well, that's funny.
I actually proposed tonight.

25:51.329 --> 25:53.428
It's to my doctor, isn't it?

25:53.430 --> 25:55.030
I saw you two at the dinner.

25:58.368 --> 26:00.468
You know, the first time we
were supposed to get married,

26:00.470 --> 26:04.673
I, um... well,
we got into a car accident,

26:04.675 --> 26:07.075
and I ended up in a coma
for eight months.

26:07.077 --> 26:10.778
And when I woke up,
I could talk to, um...

26:10.780 --> 26:12.947
Dead people?

26:12.949 --> 26:14.149
Spirits.

26:16.052 --> 26:17.585
And because of that,

26:17.587 --> 26:19.720
the second time we were
supposed to get married,

26:19.722 --> 26:22.423
I didn't show up.

26:22.425 --> 26:24.159
Well, you know what they say.

26:24.161 --> 26:25.926
Third time's a charm?

26:25.928 --> 26:28.462
- You should show up.
- Right.

26:30.099 --> 26:34.101
Anyway, things haven't been,
uh, all that great lately.

26:34.103 --> 26:37.004
So, you decided to double down.

26:37.006 --> 26:38.639
Put a ring on it.

26:38.641 --> 26:41.108
Yeah, apparently I do that.

26:41.110 --> 26:43.177
Well, can I see it?

26:43.179 --> 26:44.444
What?

26:44.446 --> 26:46.079
The ring.

26:46.081 --> 26:47.881
Well, actually,
she's got the hardware.

26:47.883 --> 26:50.717
I just... I just have the fancy box.

27:10.969 --> 27:14.404
Oh, Dr. Kinney, I wanted you
to know that Dustin's surgery

27:14.406 --> 27:16.472
went off without a hitch.

27:16.474 --> 27:18.741
And you what? You wanna gloat?

27:18.743 --> 27:20.810
It's not really my style.

27:20.812 --> 27:24.847
I prefer a quiet,
self-congratulatory smugness.

27:24.849 --> 27:27.716
I wanted to apologize.

27:27.718 --> 27:29.718
For what?

27:29.720 --> 27:32.220
Saving a patient's life?

27:36.893 --> 27:39.061
I'm the one who should apologize.

27:39.063 --> 27:41.229
Oh, no. No, there's no need.

27:41.231 --> 27:43.665
Really. I can't imagine what
you've been through, Dr. Kinney.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.134
Yeah, too much to take
an ass implant seriously

27:46.136 --> 27:47.469
anymore, apparently.

27:51.908 --> 27:55.109
Getting sick and-and...

27:55.111 --> 27:58.613
coming back, I...

27:58.615 --> 28:01.349
I'm having a hard time.

28:01.351 --> 28:03.084
A hard time what?

28:06.456 --> 28:09.490
Believing in anything.

28:11.127 --> 28:15.062
I just... Everything has
changed, and I, um...

28:20.536 --> 28:23.737
It's just, it's scaring the hell out of me.

28:32.447 --> 28:35.482
And, um, seeing how
your hunches have been

28:35.484 --> 28:39.619
bang on today, Williams,

28:39.621 --> 28:41.554
tell me, what should I do?

28:44.026 --> 28:46.459
I don't know.

28:48.663 --> 28:51.131
Right.

28:53.868 --> 28:56.836
Thanks, kiddo. Good talk.

29:01.843 --> 29:03.643
Ruth? Where you going?

29:03.645 --> 29:05.377
Um, just gonna go get some air.

29:05.379 --> 29:07.346
Don't leave.

29:07.348 --> 29:09.615
I have to.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.950
If the next few hours are critical,

29:11.952 --> 29:13.519
I shouldn't be here.

29:13.521 --> 29:16.455
Yes, you should. Grace needs you.

29:16.457 --> 29:18.123
She needs me to do what's right,

29:18.125 --> 29:20.926
and for the first time in my
life, that's what I'm gonna do.

29:20.928 --> 29:22.627
But you can't possibly think

29:22.629 --> 29:24.663
that this is the right thing to do.

29:24.665 --> 29:27.331
So, what, you'd rather I just
stay here and wait

29:27.333 --> 29:29.634
for something bad to happen again?

29:29.636 --> 29:31.135
Because I'm not gonna let it.

29:31.137 --> 29:34.673
Ruth, none of this is your fault.

29:34.675 --> 29:37.375
Yes, it is.

29:37.377 --> 29:39.878
I can't explain it.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.213
Some people, you put them together,

29:42.215 --> 29:44.415
and no matter how much
they love each other,

29:44.417 --> 29:46.284
they just don't work.

29:46.286 --> 29:48.252
They just don't.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.821
And if you deny that, it's dangerous.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.591
I don't believe that.

29:53.593 --> 29:57.228
You have a child who needs you,
and nothing else matters.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.330
If you walk out that door,
you're gonna regret it.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.299
Don't do it.

30:07.473 --> 30:08.739
Is it...

30:08.741 --> 30:12.109
No. No, no. Uh, it's another patient.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.944
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.

30:17.382 --> 30:20.850
Dawn. What's wrong?

30:20.852 --> 30:23.720
The arm has been bleeding for hours.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.656
If I could just restore perfusion...

30:26.658 --> 30:28.791
The arm may be too far gone already.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.928
You wanna amputate?

30:31.930 --> 30:33.930
Is that what you're telling me?

30:33.932 --> 30:36.933
No. That's not an option.

30:49.947 --> 30:52.348
All right, let's see where we're at.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.551
Removing the clamps.

31:00.958 --> 31:03.559
Come on, Charlie.

31:09.633 --> 31:12.100
We have perfusion.

31:12.102 --> 31:13.501
It's gonna be okay.

31:13.503 --> 31:15.871
We may have saved the arm, but like I said,

31:15.873 --> 31:17.438
it's been bleeding for a while.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.942
So you're saying you may not be
able to operate again.

31:20.944 --> 31:22.910
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

31:22.912 --> 31:25.613
Okay, let's tidy up and prepare to close.

31:25.615 --> 31:26.881
Thank you.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.627
How many more times can we do this?

31:59.548 --> 32:02.449
Well, look who's here.

32:04.286 --> 32:06.720
You had us scared, Charlie.

32:10.959 --> 32:15.628
I, um, I would've thought you'd
have been used to that by now.

32:17.465 --> 32:18.698
You in pain?

32:18.700 --> 32:21.034
Not anymore.

32:25.907 --> 32:27.673
You know, I've been trying
to put this hunk of junk

32:27.675 --> 32:31.210
on your finger for years.

32:31.212 --> 32:34.513
You didn't think I'd forget?

32:34.515 --> 32:36.815
No.

32:40.788 --> 32:42.255
Charlie?

32:42.257 --> 32:44.257
The light's too bright.

32:44.259 --> 32:46.158
- Charlie, what's going on?
- Oh, no.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.227
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- What? What is it?

32:48.229 --> 32:49.995
Alex, where's Grace?

32:49.997 --> 32:51.596
She's in recovery. Her mother's with her.

32:51.598 --> 32:53.132
- No, she's not.
- She's fine.

32:53.134 --> 32:54.633
No. You need to go to her now.

32:54.635 --> 32:56.101
- Charlie. Charlie, I was just with her.
- Alex...

32:56.103 --> 32:57.369
- She's fine!
- Go to her.

32:57.371 --> 32:58.670
I'm really scared.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.305
Go now.

33:33.139 --> 33:35.673
Ruth.

33:35.675 --> 33:39.176
I should've gone. You made me stay.

33:41.213 --> 33:44.014
She's gone.

33:44.016 --> 33:46.550
My baby's gone.

33:47.687 --> 33:49.553
I am sorry.

33:49.555 --> 33:52.522
I am so sorry.

33:54.326 --> 33:58.228
I killed her.

34:05.904 --> 34:09.938
No!

34:15.841 --> 34:17.373
So can we officially call this

34:17.376 --> 34:21.378
the calm after the storm and make out?

34:21.380 --> 34:24.614
Well, we have been up for 36 hours, so...

34:24.617 --> 34:27.150
that might be the only way
we can stay awake.

34:37.562 --> 34:39.896
Hey, whoa. Oh, jeez.

34:43.735 --> 34:46.168
Come in!

34:49.206 --> 34:51.007
Am I interrupting?

34:51.009 --> 34:53.175
- No, no.
- Kind of.

34:53.177 --> 34:57.112
Dawn, um...
I need a minute.

34:59.316 --> 35:03.018
All right, well, I should
probably get to the E.R.

35:04.555 --> 35:07.789
You know, emergencies and whatnot.

35:11.628 --> 35:14.096
This seems serious.

35:14.098 --> 35:17.366
Look, uh...

35:17.368 --> 35:21.436
you have been amazing to me
through my entire illness.

35:21.438 --> 35:23.504
Are you quitting?

35:23.506 --> 35:25.506
No.

35:25.508 --> 35:26.942
Thank God.

35:26.944 --> 35:29.377
But...

35:29.379 --> 35:32.581
Dawn, I have changed.

35:32.583 --> 35:37.718
And-and I need to be
the doctor to fit that change.

35:37.720 --> 35:40.221
I'm not following.

35:40.223 --> 35:43.757
I'm not really sure myself.

35:43.759 --> 35:47.061
But I-I need to...

35:50.133 --> 35:53.667
In the time that I have left,

35:53.669 --> 35:56.236
I need to make it count.

35:58.273 --> 36:01.308
I want to re-certify...

36:01.310 --> 36:04.444
as a trauma surgeon.

36:04.446 --> 36:07.614
I want to save lives, not bums.

36:07.616 --> 36:09.983
You wanna go back to school at your age?

36:09.985 --> 36:13.520
Careful, careful. Watch the ageism, Chief.

36:13.522 --> 36:15.322
Dana, residency.

36:15.324 --> 36:17.724
You-you would be rounding with the newbies,

36:17.726 --> 36:19.426
covering call every other night.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.528
- Think about it.
- I'm up for all of it.

36:21.530 --> 36:23.896
So what? You expect me to just
let you jump the queue?

36:23.898 --> 36:26.766
I think I've earned that right, yes.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.936
Dana, with all due respect,

36:29.938 --> 36:32.105
you wouldn't last a month as a resident.

36:34.275 --> 36:36.943
You wanna bet?

36:36.945 --> 36:40.113
Hmm? Come on.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.481
Really? You're so sure?

36:42.483 --> 36:44.517
Put your money where
your mouth is, Chief.

36:49.857 --> 36:51.657
Name your stakes.

36:53.761 --> 36:56.529
Give me a consult. Anything.

36:56.531 --> 36:58.429
I don't have anything.

36:58.431 --> 37:00.899
What about that guy?

37:00.901 --> 37:04.536
He has an STI that he didn't
get from his wife.

37:04.538 --> 37:06.938
Mm, he's clutching his abdomen.

37:06.940 --> 37:09.207
That's because she slugged him there.

37:09.209 --> 37:11.677
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Why?

37:11.679 --> 37:15.246
- Fellowship Award.
- I'd completely forgotten.

37:15.248 --> 37:18.316
Yeah, the night did take a turn.

37:18.318 --> 37:21.386
When I woke up this morning, I thought,

37:21.388 --> 37:23.087
"Maggie, you've arrived."

37:23.089 --> 37:24.855
"You're accepting your Fellowship Award,"

37:24.857 --> 37:27.692
"and your cancer study is
gonna save the world."

37:27.694 --> 37:31.295
And then Charlie got shot,
and that poor girl's...

37:31.297 --> 37:33.297
And I don't get to care about any of it.

37:33.299 --> 37:35.833
Okay, what you just said,
all of that's still true,

37:35.835 --> 37:38.368
no matter what happened today.

37:40.106 --> 37:44.075
The man I might be in love with is happy.

37:44.077 --> 37:46.077
Genuinely happy.

37:46.079 --> 37:49.446
With a woman that I really like.

37:49.448 --> 37:51.648
And I lost a patient today...

37:51.650 --> 37:54.651
a sweet girl whose luck ran out.

37:54.653 --> 37:57.221
This isn't what arrived
is supposed to feel like.

37:59.425 --> 38:00.824
Good night.

38:04.863 --> 38:07.330
Without a doubt, craziest night of my life.

38:07.332 --> 38:09.065
I'm still buzzing.

38:09.067 --> 38:10.767
Yeah, well, saving lives will do that.

38:10.769 --> 38:12.202
Mm.

38:12.204 --> 38:15.438
News travels fast.

38:16.808 --> 38:19.642
Yeah, sorry, I'm not exactly Jaxxx material.

38:19.644 --> 38:21.577
Says who?

38:21.579 --> 38:23.346
You know, Jaxxx isn't
the only club in the world.

38:27.084 --> 38:29.084
Cassie, what are you doing?

38:29.086 --> 38:31.554
Somebody told me that men
can't be exploited.

38:33.424 --> 38:34.724
Oh!

38:34.726 --> 38:36.491
I wanna test that theory.

38:55.011 --> 38:56.611
Maggie, hold on. Just...

39:03.953 --> 39:06.988
I paid one of the medics
to go back and grab it.

39:06.990 --> 39:10.291
Congratulations, Maggie Lin.
You have arrived.

39:10.293 --> 39:12.493
Thank you.

39:15.665 --> 39:18.632
- Good night.
- Yeah.

39:32.881 --> 39:35.816
Hey, beautiful.

39:35.818 --> 39:37.584
Congratulations, by the way.

39:46.695 --> 39:49.196
"The fault, Dear Brutus,
is not in our stars,"

39:49.198 --> 39:50.630
"but in ourselves."

39:53.235 --> 39:55.568
Think Joel used to say that
before he, uh,

39:55.570 --> 39:57.003
went into surgery.

39:57.005 --> 39:59.939
Joel loved him some Shakespeare.

39:59.941 --> 40:01.941
Yes, he did.

40:01.943 --> 40:05.110
Pretentious little... whoo!

40:09.951 --> 40:12.418
Grace didn't make it, did she?

40:12.420 --> 40:14.654
No.

40:14.656 --> 40:16.255
Must've thrown an embolus.

40:16.257 --> 40:19.725
She was dead by the time I got there.

40:19.727 --> 40:22.194
But you knew that already, didn't you?

40:24.165 --> 40:25.965
I just spent the better part of the night

40:25.967 --> 40:28.000
trying to convince a mother
that she wasn't

40:28.002 --> 40:31.703
bad for her daughter, and I was...

40:31.705 --> 40:33.271
I was wrong.

40:36.577 --> 40:40.278
How many times can you end up
in a hospital bed?

40:40.280 --> 40:42.247
How many more miracles?

40:43.950 --> 40:47.719
One of these times you're not
gonna wake up, and I...

40:47.721 --> 40:50.488
I can't... I can't bear that.

40:53.260 --> 40:55.193
What are you saying?

40:57.063 --> 40:59.063
You think we're cursed?

41:01.935 --> 41:04.602
Alex, that's crazy.

41:04.604 --> 41:06.637
Charlie...

41:06.639 --> 41:09.273
you talk to ghosts.

41:09.275 --> 41:11.442
Don't talk to me about crazy.

41:13.979 --> 41:17.247
And I... I love you.

41:17.249 --> 41:22.419
I love you more than I've loved
anyone in my entire life, but...

41:22.421 --> 41:26.356
But this? Us?

41:26.358 --> 41:28.725
We can't keep ignoring the signs.

41:33.432 --> 41:36.533
There's a little boy...

41:36.535 --> 41:38.735
in his crib at home.

41:41.005 --> 41:42.605
That's a sign.

41:43.809 --> 41:47.310
And that ring on your finger,

41:47.312 --> 41:49.312
that's a sign, too.

41:50.982 --> 41:52.615
Yeah.

42:18.108 --> 42:20.041
I can't.
