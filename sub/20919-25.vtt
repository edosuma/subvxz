WEBVTT

00:03.395 --> 00:04.003
[Doctor Strange]
We've defeated the Beyonder.

00:04.078 --> 00:08.080
Well done. But now, Loki,

00:08.157 --> 00:10.509
I need you to return
the Eye of Agamotto to me.

00:10.586 --> 00:12.919
About that, Doctor Strange...

00:12.996 --> 00:14.421
No.

00:14.498 --> 00:16.331
Loki...

00:16.408 --> 00:19.667
I really had you
this time, didn't I?

00:19.745 --> 00:21.928
Gaining your trust,
fighting the Beyonder,

00:22.005 --> 00:23.597
allowing me
to join the Avengers,

00:23.673 --> 00:25.766
winning the Secret Wars,

00:25.842 --> 00:28.343
giving me the Eye of Agamotto.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.938
[chuckles] By Odin's
beard, I am evil.

00:32.015 --> 00:34.182
How did Loki take
the Eye of Agamotto?

00:34.260 --> 00:35.926
The Eye cannot be taken.

00:35.928 --> 00:38.203
It must be given.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.688
To stop The Beyonder,
I had to give it to him.

00:40.766 --> 00:42.690
But now that the Eye is mine,

00:42.768 --> 00:48.939
I am the most powerful wielder
of magic in the universe.

00:48.941 --> 00:51.699
Let's make it official,
shall we?

00:51.777 --> 00:54.778
With a sad heart,
I resign from the Avengers.

00:54.780 --> 00:59.892
I'm leaving to explore other
exciting new opportunities,

00:59.968 --> 01:03.378
a universe full
of strings to pull.

01:03.455 --> 01:07.048
Not going to let that
happen, Loki.

01:07.126 --> 01:08.809
Don't worry your little heads.

01:08.885 --> 01:10.294
I'll get to you
and yours soon enough.

01:10.296 --> 01:12.220
[all grunt]

01:12.298 --> 01:13.572
Uhh! Aah!

01:15.968 --> 01:17.801
Except you, brother.

01:17.803 --> 01:21.238
I have plans for you.

01:25.994 --> 01:28.161
Back home on planet Earth.

01:28.238 --> 01:29.421
Too bad we can't stay.

01:29.498 --> 01:30.923
You got that right.

01:30.999 --> 01:32.424
We need to get back at Loki.

01:32.501 --> 01:34.220
[Captain America] We're
going to do more than that.

01:34.244 --> 01:36.837
We're gonna plan.
We're gonna fight.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.097
We're going to avenge.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:51.670 --> 01:53.094
[Black Panther] We are here.

01:53.172 --> 01:55.280
The Avengers have assembled.

01:55.357 --> 01:57.282
[Ant-Man] So do we
have one of those...

01:57.359 --> 01:59.009
What do the kids call them
nowadays? Plans?

01:59.011 --> 02:00.677
'Cause we can't just wait here

02:00.679 --> 02:01.436
for Loki to make the next move.

02:01.513 --> 02:02.955
Ant-Man's right.

02:03.031 --> 02:05.015
Aw. Thank you, Hulk.

02:05.017 --> 02:05.457
It means a lot
to have your support.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.609
[growling]

02:07.686 --> 02:08.943
I'll shut up now.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.130
When do we leave for Asgard?

02:11.206 --> 02:13.707
I'm trying, but Loki's sealed
all the magical pathways

02:13.783 --> 02:16.209
and portals between
the Nine Realms.

02:16.286 --> 02:17.861
There's no way through.

02:17.863 --> 02:20.622
So even if we possessed
Thor's hammer,

02:20.699 --> 02:22.866
we could not get back to Asgard.

02:22.868 --> 02:25.035
Even if we had Thor's hammer,

02:25.037 --> 02:26.397
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.725
Dr. Foster?

02:31.801 --> 02:32.801
I'm here.

02:35.047 --> 02:36.655
We were a little worried

02:36.732 --> 02:38.306
the way you ran off like that.

02:38.384 --> 02:40.975
Sorry. I had to step back.

02:41.053 --> 02:42.327
It's all so overwhelming.

02:42.404 --> 02:44.979
I'm supposed to be a scientist,

02:45.057 --> 02:46.497
not an Asgardian-whatever
of Thunder.

02:46.558 --> 02:49.242
I don't know if I can do this.

02:49.319 --> 02:50.555
Hey, look at what
you've already done.

02:50.579 --> 02:52.746
You found the missing Avengers,

02:52.822 --> 02:54.656
sent us across dimensions,

02:54.733 --> 02:56.658
stopped Ragnarok,
became a sheriff,

02:56.735 --> 02:58.752
rode dinosaurs.

02:58.828 --> 03:01.663
Asgardian-whatever
should be a cakewalk.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.516
No one knows what they
can do until they try.

03:04.593 --> 03:05.851
Trust your instincts, Jane.

03:05.928 --> 03:08.511
You know more about being
an Avenger than you think.

03:11.083 --> 03:14.809
I don't know capes,
but I know science.

03:22.428 --> 03:23.351
[Odin] Loki!

03:23.429 --> 03:26.854
I should have foreseen
this betrayal.

03:26.932 --> 03:28.031
[grunting]

03:30.769 --> 03:33.361
[roaring]

03:33.439 --> 03:37.549
Your misguided ambitions
will come to naught!

03:37.626 --> 03:39.776
This is a momentous
occasion in history.

03:39.778 --> 03:43.538
All-Father Odin's defeat,

03:43.615 --> 03:46.007
falling at the hands of his son.

03:47.953 --> 03:49.970
Deluded boy!

03:50.046 --> 03:51.972
Many would-be conquerors

03:52.048 --> 03:54.291
have tried to usurp me
and failed.

03:54.293 --> 03:57.477
You are an arrogant whelp, Loki,

03:57.554 --> 04:00.297
with neither the magic nor
the fortitude to defeat me.

04:00.299 --> 04:02.741
Oh, I beg to differ.

04:02.818 --> 04:04.243
I have power,

04:04.319 --> 04:06.820
and I know how to use it.

04:09.065 --> 04:10.365
Aah!

04:12.494 --> 04:13.494
[groans]

04:15.347 --> 04:20.091
[laughing]

04:20.168 --> 04:22.243
What are you supposed to do

04:22.321 --> 04:24.263
when all your dreams come true?

04:24.339 --> 04:25.931
Rhetorical question.

04:26.008 --> 04:27.393
I know exactly
what I'm going to do.

04:27.417 --> 04:30.552
But I'll grant you a chance
to beg for mercy anyway.

04:32.255 --> 04:33.997
You have no right

04:33.999 --> 04:34.999
to our father's throne!

04:36.668 --> 04:37.668
Aah!

04:40.689 --> 04:43.431
Oh, it seems he doesn't
need his throne anymore,

04:43.509 --> 04:44.949
since he'll be staying
in the dungeon

04:45.010 --> 04:46.843
for the foreseeable future.

04:46.845 --> 04:49.012
Everything that belonged to him

04:49.014 --> 04:51.515
belongs to me.

04:51.517 --> 04:53.125
And this is just the beginning.

04:53.201 --> 04:57.287
You have no idea the things
that belong to me now.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.712
[chuckling]

05:05.789 --> 05:09.049
The Casket of Darkness?

05:09.125 --> 05:12.052
One of the most dangerous
artifacts

05:12.128 --> 05:13.887
that belonged to Odin,

05:13.963 --> 05:16.964
filled with mystical All-Dark,

05:17.042 --> 05:19.209
and it's all mine.

05:19.211 --> 05:20.485
Loki.

05:22.214 --> 05:24.714
Oh. Hoo! Ho ho ho ho!

05:24.716 --> 05:27.492
The All-Dark ends life.

05:27.569 --> 05:30.236
Even you must respect
its danger.

05:30.313 --> 05:33.573
I am the Sorcerer Supreme now,

05:33.650 --> 05:36.818
so maybe the All-Dark
needs to respect me.

05:36.895 --> 05:38.562
Oh.

05:38.564 --> 05:41.006
[chuckles] Maybe later.

05:41.083 --> 05:43.083
I have something different
in mind for now.

05:49.666 --> 05:52.576
Take your hammer, Thor.
I offer it to you.

05:52.578 --> 05:55.512
All you have to do is call it.

06:01.587 --> 06:02.587
[grunting]

06:08.093 --> 06:11.203
[laughing] Oh, no.

06:11.279 --> 06:14.206
You have no hammer.

06:14.282 --> 06:15.865
What are you going to do?

06:17.786 --> 06:19.452
Ehh.

06:19.529 --> 06:22.288
Hitting someone
when they're not looking?

06:22.365 --> 06:24.441
Ooh, that's really
more my thing.

06:24.443 --> 06:25.443
Naah!

06:27.704 --> 06:29.446
[grunting]

06:29.448 --> 06:30.448
Hyah!

06:33.118 --> 06:35.209
I could use magic,

06:35.287 --> 06:37.120
but I have a sneaking suspicion

06:37.122 --> 06:38.972
that this way
is more humiliating!

06:39.048 --> 06:40.974
Aah!

06:41.050 --> 06:42.401
I am not worthy

06:42.477 --> 06:44.051
to lift Mjolnir like you are,

06:44.129 --> 06:46.479
but I am the Sorcerer Supreme.

06:46.556 --> 06:48.073
And with Father imprisoned,

06:48.150 --> 06:49.732
I'm also now the All-Father.

06:52.304 --> 06:56.139
Which means I can do anything.

06:56.141 --> 06:58.308
I'll take that.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.326
No!

07:00.403 --> 07:02.570
I used the power
of the All-Father

07:02.648 --> 07:04.497
to seal the pathways
between Asgard and Earth.

07:04.574 --> 07:07.092
No one gets through
unless I will it.

07:07.169 --> 07:08.501
Technology work-around.

07:08.578 --> 07:11.913
I'm mortal and not under
the power of the All-Father,

07:11.990 --> 07:13.823
so you have no power over me.

07:13.825 --> 07:15.434
Or us!

07:16.845 --> 07:20.922
Ho ho ho ho! How angry.

07:20.999 --> 07:23.683
But if your mightiest are here,

07:23.760 --> 07:25.727
oh, who's protecting
your precious Earth?

07:28.674 --> 07:32.692
While I was one of you,
fighting in your Secret War,

07:32.769 --> 07:34.619
I discovered
that your greatest strength

07:34.696 --> 07:36.270
is your greatest weakness.

07:36.348 --> 07:38.198
Your strength is your focus

07:38.274 --> 07:40.350
and ability to protect others.

07:40.352 --> 07:42.352
But your weakness is
that you'll never be able

07:42.354 --> 07:44.129
to protect everyone.

07:47.192 --> 07:48.416
The Bifrost!

07:50.787 --> 07:52.629
[growling]

07:56.702 --> 07:57.792
I have unlimited magic,

07:57.869 --> 07:59.644
unlimited beasts,

07:59.721 --> 08:01.813
so go do what you always do...

08:01.890 --> 08:05.299
Save your Earth.

08:05.377 --> 08:07.227
Uh, Cap, if you ever wanted

08:07.303 --> 08:08.878
to say one of those bad words
I taught you,

08:08.880 --> 08:10.000
now would be a perfect time.

08:12.475 --> 08:13.883
[Loki]
You think you can stop me,

08:13.885 --> 08:17.829
stop my army, save the
people of Earth, [clamoring]

08:17.906 --> 08:19.033
Be the heroes.
[tires screeching]

08:19.057 --> 08:21.074
[scoffs] Predictable.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.059
But whatever you decide to do,

08:23.061 --> 08:25.578
it will all be for nothing.

08:25.655 --> 08:28.081
Thors, Doctor Strange,
your team has Loki.

08:28.157 --> 08:29.841
The rest of you, with me.

08:32.904 --> 08:34.495
Ho-hmm.

08:34.573 --> 08:36.664
I'm finished toying with you.

08:36.741 --> 08:38.517
I will see you fall...

08:38.592 --> 08:42.169
In tears, then in death.

08:42.246 --> 08:43.522
If this is the end,

08:43.597 --> 08:46.173
then how better than in battle,

08:46.251 --> 08:47.675
standing with my friends
next to me?

08:47.753 --> 08:50.195
For Asgard!

08:50.272 --> 08:51.530
[Jane Foster Thor] For Midgard!

08:51.606 --> 08:53.198
[Loki] For myself!

08:53.275 --> 08:54.849
[laughing]

08:54.926 --> 08:55.926
Hyah!

09:00.023 --> 09:01.039
[screaming]

09:06.104 --> 09:07.104
I have you!

09:08.197 --> 09:10.123
Ha ha ha ha!

09:10.199 --> 09:12.125
Can't leave so soon.

09:12.201 --> 09:14.627
I'm not through with you yet!

09:14.704 --> 09:16.296
Give me the Eye, Loki.

09:16.372 --> 09:19.799
Its power is wasted
on the likes of you.

09:19.876 --> 09:22.877
Petty insults are so
unbecoming of a doctor.

09:22.954 --> 09:24.378
Raah!

09:24.456 --> 09:25.897
My insults and my magic

09:25.974 --> 09:27.548
are stronger than yours.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.902
By the Crimson Bands
of Cyttorak!

09:30.979 --> 09:32.895
Uhh! Uhh. Oh. Ohh!

09:35.984 --> 09:36.741
[grunts]

09:36.818 --> 09:39.077
Excuse me, Doctor.

09:39.154 --> 09:40.281
It's been fun mingling with you,

09:40.305 --> 09:42.138
but I see some people

09:42.140 --> 09:44.082
who I'm dying
to get reacquainted with.

09:44.159 --> 09:45.825
Loki, no!

09:47.145 --> 09:48.753
[both] Aah!

09:52.667 --> 09:55.760
Crushing the Avengers
has been my goal,

09:55.837 --> 09:59.580
but crushing the two of you
has been my dream.

09:59.658 --> 10:02.325
[laughing]

10:02.327 --> 10:04.585
If you had any idea

10:04.663 --> 10:06.512
the power flowing through me...

10:06.589 --> 10:08.089
Uhh!

10:08.166 --> 10:09.590
Aah! Uhh!

10:09.668 --> 10:12.101
I think you're starting
to get the idea.

10:16.099 --> 10:17.765
[Captain America]
Avengers, this is it!

10:17.843 --> 10:19.767
We cannot allow Loki's army

10:19.845 --> 10:21.245
to create a beachhead
here on Earth.

10:21.270 --> 10:25.123
Whatever happens in Asgard
right now is out of our hands.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.108
But we control
what happens here.

10:27.185 --> 10:28.185
Ready.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.955
Set.

10:36.862 --> 10:38.136
And go!

10:42.033 --> 10:43.353
[Iron Man]
Hit 'em hard, Avengers.

11:06.074 --> 11:07.074
Wait!

11:08.727 --> 11:09.727
Okay, go!

11:17.827 --> 11:19.230
These guys are
even weirder up close.

11:19.254 --> 11:22.338
Although now I see why they
call them "mindless ones."

11:29.080 --> 11:30.522
Yep. Not too bright.

11:40.258 --> 11:41.258
[groans]

11:50.693 --> 11:51.768
Aah!

11:51.770 --> 11:53.211
[grunts]

11:53.288 --> 11:55.455
Loki! I'm sorry, brother,

11:55.531 --> 11:57.440
but you give me no choice!

11:57.442 --> 11:59.050
Don't apologize.

11:59.127 --> 12:00.201
Ever.

12:00.278 --> 12:02.962
[grunting]

12:03.039 --> 12:06.373
Oh, brother. You look awful.

12:06.451 --> 12:08.375
I should put you
out of your misery,

12:08.453 --> 12:09.802
and indeed I will,

12:09.879 --> 12:12.397
when you perish among
the branches of Yggdrasil,

12:12.474 --> 12:14.566
the Tree of Life!

12:14.642 --> 12:15.642
Aah!

12:19.297 --> 12:20.554
Ohh! Uhh.

12:20.632 --> 12:23.316
[grunting]

12:23.392 --> 12:24.801
Ohh.

12:24.803 --> 12:26.077
[panting]

12:26.154 --> 12:28.154
I must keep fighting.

12:28.231 --> 12:30.656
But by Odin's beard,

12:30.733 --> 12:32.976
I know not
if I have the strength.

12:32.978 --> 12:36.329
But perhaps I can find help

12:36.405 --> 12:38.206
amongst the ruins
of this ancient battle.

12:44.506 --> 12:45.506
Uhh!

12:52.922 --> 12:54.922
They just keep coming!

12:55.000 --> 12:58.167
We can't fail.
We have to hold the line!

12:58.169 --> 12:59.727
Special delivery!

13:02.857 --> 13:04.617
We're slowing them down.
But it's not enough.

13:07.846 --> 13:08.861
Loki!

13:13.018 --> 13:14.951
Now where did you find the ax?

13:17.522 --> 13:19.188
Not that it will matter
in the end.

13:19.190 --> 13:20.373
[growling]

13:23.528 --> 13:24.585
Aah!

13:27.365 --> 13:28.698
We have him!

13:28.700 --> 13:30.975
You have nothing.

13:38.543 --> 13:41.135
[all grunt]

13:41.212 --> 13:42.614
I hadn't figured out
how best to slay you.

13:42.638 --> 13:44.814
I hoped an idea
would just come to me.

13:46.718 --> 13:48.401
And it has.

13:48.477 --> 13:50.386
The All-Dark!

13:50.388 --> 13:53.331
Farewell, Avengers.

13:53.408 --> 13:55.992
[laughing]

14:08.497 --> 14:10.590
[laughing]

14:10.666 --> 14:12.575
Ooh, you and your little
magic tricks.

14:12.577 --> 14:17.013
But only Asgardian magic
can block the All-Dark. Hyah!

14:18.766 --> 14:20.841
[grunting]

14:20.919 --> 14:22.193
No!

14:24.939 --> 14:28.257
That tar is burning
through the tree.

14:28.259 --> 14:31.277
We must get the All-Dark
off the Tree of Life.

14:31.354 --> 14:34.113
If the tree dies,
the universe dies with it.

14:37.026 --> 14:39.043
By the blinding blades
of Eldredim!

14:41.272 --> 14:42.529
[Jane Foster Thor] It's no use.

14:42.607 --> 14:43.956
It's consuming the whole tree!

14:52.375 --> 14:54.058
Ah! Naah!

15:04.796 --> 15:05.853
Uhh! Aah!

15:08.391 --> 15:09.890
Almost out of
rainbow real estate.

15:09.968 --> 15:13.069
Lousy mindless jerks!

15:14.139 --> 15:16.822
Hulk, you seem angry.

15:16.899 --> 15:19.492
Of course I'm angry!
Now get big and get fighting!

15:19.568 --> 15:22.311
Uhh! Oh.

15:22.313 --> 15:25.089
Oh, ho ho! Hulk,
you just gave me an idea.

15:25.166 --> 15:26.385
You're really gonna hate me
after this one,

15:26.409 --> 15:29.260
but, uh, trust me,
the drooling is normal.

15:29.337 --> 15:31.320
Scott, you know
Hulk is gonna kill you

15:31.322 --> 15:32.746
when this is over, right?

15:32.824 --> 15:35.249
If this works,
it'll be worth it.

15:35.326 --> 15:36.434
Ant-man!

15:36.511 --> 15:39.512
Raah!

16:02.036 --> 16:03.703
Raah!

16:05.373 --> 16:07.298
Oh, Thor, don't you see?

16:07.375 --> 16:11.085
You and all life
in the universe are doomed.

16:14.123 --> 16:16.365
But before the universe goes,

16:16.367 --> 16:18.217
you go first!

16:19.704 --> 16:21.554
Uhh! Keep working
on the All-Dark.

16:21.630 --> 16:23.648
Loki's mine.

16:23.725 --> 16:26.317
Huhh... uh!

16:28.546 --> 16:30.880
Hyah!

16:30.882 --> 16:32.982
You've been a thorn
in my side for too long.

16:36.054 --> 16:38.496
You may be stronger
than you were before, Loki,

16:38.573 --> 16:39.822
but so am I! [Grunts]

16:43.228 --> 16:45.911
Loki's magic
has enchanted the All-Dark.

16:45.988 --> 16:47.897
The only way to stop it
is through Loki himself.

16:47.899 --> 16:49.565
But how?

16:49.567 --> 16:51.009
He's your brother.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.960
You must make him see the truth.

16:54.572 --> 16:56.347
Aah!

16:59.577 --> 17:00.501
Yaah!

17:00.578 --> 17:01.578
Uhh!

17:04.749 --> 17:07.191
Come to join the party, brother?

17:07.268 --> 17:10.419
Listen to me, Loki.

17:10.421 --> 17:11.921
If the Tree of Life dies,

17:11.923 --> 17:13.355
you will not survive.

17:17.019 --> 17:19.762
Bah! I'm the All-Father

17:19.763 --> 17:22.431
and the Sorcerer Supreme
of the universe.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.784
I can survive anything.

17:24.859 --> 17:26.527
Not this you can't!

17:26.604 --> 17:30.273
If you don't believe me,
use the Eye of Agamotto.

17:30.275 --> 17:31.791
It sees all.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.367
What are you up to?

17:33.444 --> 17:35.294
Is this your idea of a trick?

17:36.781 --> 17:39.390
No. No tricks.

17:39.467 --> 17:41.300
This is the truth, brother.

17:50.628 --> 17:51.628
[gasps]

18:02.974 --> 18:05.157
[roaring]

18:07.995 --> 18:09.587
[whimpering]

18:09.664 --> 18:11.572
Ahh. Aah!

18:11.649 --> 18:16.752
[screaming]

18:19.324 --> 18:20.324
[gasps]

18:23.995 --> 18:26.662
I cannot be defeated!

18:26.664 --> 18:28.922
This Eye doesn't reveal truth.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
It lies!

18:32.670 --> 18:34.670
Now's our chance!

18:34.672 --> 18:36.021
[growling]

18:43.014 --> 18:45.790
I am Loki,
the winner and the truth!

18:45.867 --> 18:48.517
Everyone here is a liar
except me!

18:48.519 --> 18:50.202
You've gone mad, brother!

18:50.279 --> 18:52.705
[groans]

18:52.781 --> 18:56.692
I'm not mad. You're mad!
Because I have won!

18:56.694 --> 18:58.694
Loki, shut up!

18:58.696 --> 18:59.696
Oof!

19:11.709 --> 19:12.633
[panting]

19:12.710 --> 19:14.986
But I won.

19:15.062 --> 19:17.563
Anyone who tells you different

19:17.640 --> 19:19.398
is a liar!

19:21.386 --> 19:22.885
I've removed Loki's enchantment

19:22.887 --> 19:23.903
on the All-Dark.

19:23.979 --> 19:25.388
It's now or never.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.056
Are you ready?

19:27.058 --> 19:28.449
Oh, I am so ready.

19:46.168 --> 19:49.745
No! Get away from the All-Dark!

19:49.747 --> 19:51.931
It's not yours to command!
[grunts]

19:52.007 --> 19:53.916
It belongs to me!

19:53.918 --> 19:56.419
All-powerful...

19:56.421 --> 19:57.421
Loki...

19:58.756 --> 20:00.531
Oh, no.

20:00.608 --> 20:03.534
[grunting]

20:07.022 --> 20:08.781
[grunting]

20:11.285 --> 20:13.044
Thor! [Gasps]

20:13.120 --> 20:15.862
Brother. [Muffled grunting]

20:15.940 --> 20:18.049
[muffled screaming]

20:21.279 --> 20:23.779
[Odin] Heroes are not
designed nor produced.

20:23.781 --> 20:26.724
Heroes rise.

20:26.801 --> 20:29.134
Jane Foster,

20:29.211 --> 20:32.212
having fought to restore
the throne of Asgard,

20:32.290 --> 20:35.215
you have proven yourself worthy.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.643
I dub thee Thunderstrike,

20:37.720 --> 20:40.905
and with it, a weapon worthy.

20:40.982 --> 20:42.907
May you continue
to fight valiantly

20:42.984 --> 20:44.733
to the end of your days.

20:47.805 --> 20:48.805
[camera shutter clicks]

20:49.991 --> 20:51.974
My best friend's an android,

20:51.976 --> 20:54.067
my hero is my teammate,

20:54.145 --> 20:56.236
and that over there is Asgard.

20:56.314 --> 20:59.815
It doesn't seem real sometimes.

20:59.817 --> 21:01.984
[sighs] I so didn't think I was
gonna make it as an Avenger.

21:01.986 --> 21:03.319
I would've quit on my first day

21:03.321 --> 21:05.321
if you hadn't stopped me.

21:05.323 --> 21:07.098
I thought you'd be
a good Avenger,

21:07.174 --> 21:08.507
and I was right.

21:08.584 --> 21:10.493
Saving the universe...

21:10.495 --> 21:11.844
Never gets old, does it?

21:11.920 --> 21:13.271
Nope. Even still,

21:13.347 --> 21:14.513
I could go for some vacation.

21:14.590 --> 21:16.440
But you know the moment I try,

21:16.517 --> 21:17.661
the world's gonna need us again.

21:17.685 --> 21:18.667
Alas,

21:18.669 --> 21:20.611
time is unpredictable,

21:20.688 --> 21:22.095
and the future is unknowable.

21:22.173 --> 21:25.766
Well, I know the future
will be better than the past,

21:25.843 --> 21:26.784
because heroes
will make it that way.

21:26.861 --> 21:30.029
Heroes like the Avengers.

21:30.105 --> 21:38.105
[all] Avengers Assemble!
