[Deena] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:02.417 --> 00:04.417
You could sell these
and make a fortune.

00:04.417 --> 00:05.917
Do you think I could do it?

00:05.917 --> 00:08.417
Hi, I have a delivery
for Natasha Drew.

00:08.417 --> 00:11.375
I wasn't expecting a package.

00:11.375 --> 00:15.083
I'm sorry to hear
about your divorce. Not
that I couldn't see it coming.

this week. Will you
be my "plus one"?

00:29.625 --> 00:31.583
Laura. I got them.

00:31.583 --> 00:34.250
Let me see. Cheesy magazines,
they make me so happy.

00:34.250 --> 00:35.917
I know. Me too.

00:35.917 --> 00:37.417
Especially when I'm in them.

00:37.417 --> 00:40.000
OK, I'll take these,
you take these.

00:43.417 --> 00:44.750
Oh, my God!

00:47.583 --> 00:51.125
This one has a poll
with me and someone else
in the same dress and I won.

00:51.125 --> 00:55.291
Seventy-six percent
of the people say that
I look better than Lisa Rinna.

00:56.125 --> 00:57.667
Did you guys steal my paper?

00:57.667 --> 00:59.875
And then rob a newsstand?

00:59.875 --> 01:00.959
What's going on here?

01:00.959 --> 01:02.959
We're looking
for Stephanie pictures.

01:02.959 --> 01:04.166
How's my butt?

01:04.166 --> 01:06.250
Can I have
my sports section now?

01:06.250 --> 01:08.458
And a hello would be nice.

01:08.458 --> 01:09.959
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.125
- Thank you.
- [gasps]

01:18.417 --> 01:19.458
What?

01:19.458 --> 01:21.500
Is that a picture of me
in skinny jeans?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.125
I knew they were
on the way out.

01:26.458 --> 01:29.166
- It can't be that bad.
- It's nothing.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.625
It's a picture
of us. Forget it.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.709
- Oh, come on.
- [laughing]

01:32.709 --> 01:34.542
Give it to me. All right.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.959
What does this even mean?
"Worst accessory"?

01:44.959 --> 01:47.208
It's nothing.
Just forget about it.

01:47.208 --> 01:50.083
It's one of those things they do
with red carpet pictures.

01:50.083 --> 01:52.583
When someone has an ugly purse
or bad jewelry.

01:52.583 --> 01:54.709
No, they mean me.
I'm the worst accessory.

01:54.709 --> 01:57.709
No. Maybe they just
mean the white socks
with the black suit.

01:57.709 --> 01:58.750
No, they mean him.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.834
What? It's no big deal.

02:01.834 --> 02:03.834
Look, Ben Affleck
has worst sunglasses.

02:03.834 --> 02:07.834
I have those sunglasses.
And second of all, I am those
sunglasses now.

02:07.834 --> 02:11.208
Do you have any idea
what kind of crap
I'm going to get for this?

02:11.208 --> 02:15.417
For the rest of my life?
We have to contain this.
Do not tell a soul. No one.

Mm-hm.

Wait, I'll call you back.

02:44.041 --> 02:48.792
- Dave, where are you?
- Getting a coffee and a muffin.

02:48.792 --> 02:51.500
Hey, do you guys get
Celebrity Beat magazine?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.750
No. Why, do you?
And if so, why?

02:53.750 --> 02:57.083

- Hey, we get Celebrity Beat
magazine?
- Why?

03:13.917 --> 03:16.583

Adam told me to get it.
- We don't get it.

You can wear it tomorrow,

03:26.542 --> 03:28.417
This is fantastic, Deen.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.959
Buy me one. I'm dropping
the girls off at school.

03:30.959 --> 03:32.083
OK. Whose school?

03:32.083 --> 03:35.250
Their school.
What is the matter with you?

03:35.250 --> 03:36.750
Me? Nothing's
wrong with me.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.917
I just think you should get in
and get out as fast as possible.

03:39.917 --> 03:42.291
OK.

03:42.291 --> 03:47.333
Oh, hey. Sharon. Is Tracey still
on for our play date
at our house today?

03:47.333 --> 03:49.959
Maybe Geneva should
come to our house instead.

03:49.959 --> 03:53.166
- Really?
- Or maybe we
should just re-schedule.

03:53.166 --> 03:58.083
Hi. There is Larissa's
permission slip
for the field trip.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.250
- Thanks for volunteering.
- No problem.

04:00.250 --> 04:01.709
I'm looking forward to it.

04:01.709 --> 04:06.750
I think I was Geneva's chaperone
to the La Brea Tar Pits as well.

04:10.625 --> 04:14.667
OK, uh, is something going on?
Something wrong?

04:14.667 --> 04:17.333
Did Larissa bite someone again?
We talked to her...

04:17.333 --> 04:20.834
Mrs. Greco, it's not your
daughter, it's your husband.

04:20.834 --> 04:23.583
Dave? What did he do?

04:23.583 --> 04:26.542
Your husband attacked Richard
Rovich on school property

04:26.542 --> 04:28.041
in front of all the kids.

04:28.041 --> 04:31.792
They were wrestling
on the ground like
two little... kids.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.542
- Yeah?
- Hello.

04:39.542 --> 04:43.959
Ronnie said I could come in.
I have the, uh... the documents.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.000
Hi.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.542
- I got to lock the door.
- There's no lock on the door.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.542
- Oh, really?
- Ronnie keeps them out.

04:56.542 --> 04:59.000
She's a pit bull.

legs like a bicycle.

Bella always gets cranky
when I... when I have
to wake her up from her nap.

05:10.709 --> 05:14.875
- You should never
wake a sleeping baby.
- Yes, we'll get to that.

05:14.875 --> 05:18.375
Right now, Nicole,
Cynthia was telling us
about Dylan's diaper rash.

05:18.375 --> 05:23.000
It's not going away and I call
the pediatrician every day

05:23.000 --> 05:25.542
and she just says to put
more diaper rash cream on.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.542
I'm thinking of just switching.

05:27.542 --> 05:30.208
- Creams?
- No, doctors.

05:30.208 --> 05:34.917
I'm sure it will be OK.
It's just a diaper rash, right?
Don't all babies get it?

05:34.917 --> 05:37.750
Everyone has their
own problems, Nicole.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.458

this class a judge-free zone.

- Maybe you'd like
to share something?

05:43.291 --> 05:47.250
Well, actually,
there is something that
I'd like some advice on. Yeah.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.417
And since we're
all strangers here,
maybe this is a safe place.

05:50.417 --> 05:51.917
OK.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.792
I slept with
my brother's friend Adam.

05:53.792 --> 05:56.417
And keeping this
secret is killing me.

05:56.417 --> 05:58.625
You haven't told him
he's the father?

05:58.625 --> 06:01.291
He's not the father.
This happened the other night.

06:01.291 --> 06:05.166
The point is that it's
just keeping a secret from
everyone... our friends.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.250
And, you know, Brian...
That's my brother...

06:08.250 --> 06:12.208
I don't know what he
would do if he found out
and I'm feeling so guilty.

06:12.208 --> 06:16.625
And I'm just wondering does
anyone think that I should tell?

06:18.834 --> 06:23.250

quite what mommy
and baby classes are about.

Just a six month lease.
We just thought we'd
give it a shot.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.208
What?

12:48.208 --> 12:52.000
- Oh.
- What "Oh, what"? What is it?

12:53.375 --> 12:55.291
It's a notice from the court.

12:58.792 --> 13:03.500
We have to file our divorce
paperwork next week or start
the process all over.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.458
- Divorce paperwork. That's fun.
- Yes.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.750
So, what are we going to do?
Nothing, right?

13:10.375 --> 13:11.834
Yes. Nothing.

13:11.834 --> 13:16.458
Just... keep doing
what we're doing.

13:16.458 --> 13:19.375
Right. What is it
that we're doing again?

13:19.375 --> 13:21.166
- Dating.
- Yeah.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.750
Secretly. We're moving forward.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.834
And as long as we're moving
forward then that's good, right?

13:26.834 --> 13:30.625
- Yeah, right. It's great.
- Yeah, it's great. It's good.

13:32.583 --> 13:35.250
So, can we talk about
this cupcake store for a second?

13:35.250 --> 13:39.083
[electronic music plays]

13:42.125 --> 13:46.041
I hate to say this,
but we're going to be late
if we don't go.

13:46.041 --> 13:49.792
Wouldn't you rather
just stay here than go
to that stupid restaurant?

13:49.792 --> 13:53.375
I thought you were the one
that wanted to go.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.917
- Well, this could work.
- [phone ringing]

13:59.667 --> 14:03.792
- It's my manager.
I have to get this.
- Yeah.

14:05.709 --> 14:06.750
Hello.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.125
What do you want
on your pizza?

14:08.125 --> 14:10.208
Actually, we're
going out to eat.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.083
- What's that face?
- Just my regular face.

14:14.083 --> 14:19.333
- I'll let Stephanie tell you.
- Tell me what? You ready?

14:19.333 --> 14:22.625
- I thought we were staying in?
- We have a reservation.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.458
This has nothing to do
with the way I feel about you.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.375
So don't take it personally
because I really like you.

14:28.375 --> 14:31.500
Are you breaking up with me?
Because we're not even a couple.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.750
- We haven't even had sex yet.
- Whoa. Too much information.

14:34.750 --> 14:40.583
It's my manager.
She's kind of suggesting
that I re-accessorize.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.583
Sorry, ignore me.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.959
You're taking dating advice
from your manager?

14:45.959 --> 14:48.583
No, not at all.
It's career advice,

14:48.583 --> 14:51.417
and I can't be seen with you
in public for a little while.

14:51.417 --> 14:53.834
Yeah. Why would
I take that personally?

14:53.834 --> 14:56.291
It's not going to be forever.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.083
Sausage OK?

15:05.792 --> 15:09.333
- You're going
to kill your eyes.
- Fluorescent lights depress me.

15:09.333 --> 15:13.917
So buy some better lamps.
We'll even pay for them. Perks.

15:13.917 --> 15:15.667
Speaking of which...

15:15.667 --> 15:19.792
One of our clients owns the
Atheneum Hotel in Beverly Hills.

15:19.792 --> 15:22.208
Figured you could
use a little fun.

15:22.208 --> 15:24.959
Free dinner, suite,
five-star hotel.

15:24.959 --> 15:28.125
You think you can scare
someone up to go with you?

15:28.125 --> 15:29.166
I think I can.

15:29.166 --> 15:33.500
Good. Have fun, relax.
One other thing.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.625
A Guy Rowland is going
to be in town for a few days.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.959
He works for Coopertan
Manufacturing.

15:38.959 --> 15:40.500
So you need me
to talk to him?

15:40.500 --> 15:43.333
He knows a lot about the car
locks that Coopertan makes.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.959
- Like what?
- Like whether
they're faulty or not.

15:45.959 --> 15:49.583
We need him to sign this
statement saying
that they're not.

15:52.959 --> 15:56.000
It's already written. Do I need
a witness to authenticate it?

15:56.000 --> 16:00.583
- There's no need for that.
- We already wrote this for him
without his knowledge.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.417
What if he doesn't
agree to sign it?

16:02.417 --> 16:06.041
That's what you're there for,
Hillman. Don't leave
without a signature.

16:06.041 --> 16:10.041
You're authorized
to do whatever it takes.
I have faith in you.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.458
Enjoy the hotel.

16:19.959 --> 16:22.250
[woman] This is
my very own recipe.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.917
I call it Cynthia's
Carrot Concoction.

16:25.917 --> 16:29.625
I'm so sorry. I could've sworn
that I made enough for everyone.

16:31.375 --> 16:33.375
You make your own baby food?

16:33.375 --> 16:37.542
Do you know how many
preservatives are
in processed baby food?

16:37.542 --> 16:40.333
I'm sorry about
what I said the other day.

16:40.333 --> 16:44.125
I was nervous
and I wanted to fit in.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.750
Well, that's OK.
It must be hard
for you at your age.

16:48.917 --> 16:53.000
OK, ladies, time to gather
your babies. Playtime is over.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.709
Wait.

16:59.709 --> 17:01.875
- How much would
you pay for a cupcake?
- What?

17:01.875 --> 17:05.083
My friend and I are opening
a cupcake store right over there

17:05.083 --> 17:09.625
and I'm wondering how
much you would pay for a
top-of-the-line cupcake.

17:09.625 --> 17:13.083
Probably nothing.
We don't really give
the kids sugar.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.959
[rock music plays]

17:14.959 --> 17:17.667
Oh, yeah.
Look at that, baby.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.500
"Icing on the Cupcake."

17:19.500 --> 17:22.291
So, let me get this right...
you didn't hit him?

17:22.291 --> 17:25.500
No, I tried to hit him, OK?
But he moved.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.166
I don't know.
This guy's weird.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.959
He's like a boxer.
He slipped it.

17:28.959 --> 17:30.750
I'm sure that's what it was.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.291
- This is the guy
that Deena slept...
- Don't say it.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.291
Don't say it, but yes.

17:35.291 --> 17:38.250
This guy's just a pompous ass.
I just wanted to hit him.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.458
One good shot. Like you with
Brian about the Marjorie thing.

17:41.458 --> 17:44.083
I didn't do anything
with Marjorie.

17:44.083 --> 17:46.625
What I did was wrong.
I shouldn't have hit Brian.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.417
I mean,
people sleep with people.

17:48.417 --> 17:52.291
I think we get all
worked up about the sex
thing of it all, you know?

17:52.291 --> 17:55.125
I mean, can't we all just...
I don't know, be?

17:55.125 --> 17:58.083
- Dude, you're freaking me out.
- Let me ask you something.

17:58.083 --> 18:01.500
Speaking of sex, if you guys
were going out with a hot
girl... You know,

18:01.500 --> 18:05.166
the best ass in two counties.
And she didn't want
to be seen with you.

18:05.166 --> 18:08.792
But... Hey, shut up...
But she did want to lay
around your apartment,

18:08.792 --> 18:11.333
make out and eventually
have sex, would you do it?

18:11.333 --> 18:13.208
Yeah! What,
are you kidding me?

18:13.208 --> 18:14.625
Is this some kind of joke?

18:14.625 --> 18:16.458
You're the luckiest guy
on the planet.

18:16.458 --> 18:17.625
You don't have to go out.

18:17.625 --> 18:19.667
Who wants to go out?
It's expensive.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.834
You don't have to go out
and you get sex?

18:21.834 --> 18:24.166
- That's fantastic!
- Come on, Brian. Have fun.

18:24.166 --> 18:27.959
So what if you wear
really bad socks. Who cares?

18:27.959 --> 18:29.792
You don't want
to get serious.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.041
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys.

18:31.041 --> 18:33.083
Deena's article is out. Come on.

18:33.083 --> 18:37.375
"Single and successful
Deena Greco has been
named LA's hottest cupcake."

18:37.375 --> 18:40.875
When people see this picture
they're not going
to know if they're

18:40.875 --> 18:43.500
talking about you
or the actual cupcakes.

18:43.500 --> 18:47.083
Good. As long as people
buy something. Sex sells, right?

18:47.083 --> 18:49.542
- OK, stop.
- But, I have to say,

18:49.542 --> 18:53.250
this is my second favorite
magazine of the day.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.542
Look. [laughs]

18:56.875 --> 18:58.709
- Oh, my.
- And here it comes.

18:58.709 --> 19:02.083
OK, Brian, white socks? Really?

19:02.083 --> 19:06.875
That reminds me, man.
We all got you something.
You know, it's a gift.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.875
You know, from all of us.
We all kind of chipped in.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.333
If you're going to be
the worst accessory,

19:12.333 --> 19:14.500
then you should have
the worst accessory.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.375
- They're socks.
- Wow. You guys are the best.

19:17.375 --> 19:20.208
I'm going to go out to my car
and get the rest of the stuff.

19:20.208 --> 19:23.792
You know, while I'm gone,
continue to make fun of me, OK?

19:23.792 --> 19:27.250
- Have no fear.
That will happen.
- High-five. All right.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.166
It's funny how all of a sudden
our friends are celebrities?

19:30.166 --> 19:36.125
We got Brian and Deena and...
Stephanie and Lil' Tammy.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.375
- OK.
- [laughter]

19:38.375 --> 19:41.375
OK. No. No, that's enough.

19:41.375 --> 19:43.583
What did you say
on the Lil' Tammy Show?

19:43.583 --> 19:46.083
You do not want to go there.
She gets like the Hulk.

19:46.083 --> 19:48.333
Tell us. Come on,
we're all friends.

19:48.333 --> 19:52.625
What is it? Oh, oh, oh!
I got it! I got it!
It was... it was...

19:52.625 --> 19:53.959
- Don't.
- Wowsers!

19:53.959 --> 19:55.750
- OK, that's it.
- Why don't you do one for us?

19:55.750 --> 19:58.917
Please. You owe us one
for keeping it a secret.

19:58.917 --> 20:00.000
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.208
I'm not the only
who keeps secrets.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.750
You didn't tell us
that you had sex with Nicole.

20:06.917 --> 20:10.333
- Wowsers.
- You weren't supposed
to tell anyone.

20:10.333 --> 20:14.291
Maybe if you didn't
insult me to the girls
or to Deena's lesbian mother.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.625
And you.
You weren't supposed

20:17.625 --> 20:19.583
to tell anyone either.
It was a secret.

20:19.583 --> 20:22.083
- Did you know?
- Do you think
I could keep this?

20:22.083 --> 20:27.792
So, Adam is the
"nothing special" guy?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.625
- Well, yeah.
- No!

20:30.625 --> 20:33.041
- No, no, no!
- I was something special,
I was.

20:33.041 --> 20:36.041
That's it. Enough.
Brian doesn't know, all right?

20:36.041 --> 20:41.959
And I'd like to keep it
that way. So please,
let's not tell him, OK?

20:41.959 --> 20:45.875
Things are back to normal
between us, and I'd like
to keep it that way.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.333
What? What did I miss?

20:58.000 --> 21:01.917
If you're going to blame
someone, you should blame
yourself for telling me.

21:01.917 --> 21:04.041
It's hard to look
in the mirror, isn't it?

21:04.041 --> 21:06.959
If it were a secret and you told
me, then you're just as bad.

21:06.959 --> 21:10.208
No. No, no, I'm not. Haven't you
ever heard of the marriage code?

21:10.208 --> 21:11.959
- No.
- The marriage code, woman.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.875
A husband and wife
are one unit.

21:13.875 --> 21:17.500
If you tell one something,
the other one automatically
finds out about it.

21:17.500 --> 21:21.458
If that's true, then it
is no big deal. Adam
should have known that I knew.

21:21.458 --> 21:25.500
Ivy, you have a problem.
Just admit it.
Just admit it for me.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.667
No! You never told me
it was a secret.

21:27.667 --> 21:30.333
So I think we've learned
a valuable lesson here.

21:30.333 --> 21:33.667
- Next time you
should be more clear.
- You've lost your mind!

21:33.667 --> 21:35.834
- Wowsers.
- I hate you.

21:40.625 --> 21:42.792
Can you believe this
Nic and Adam thing?

21:42.792 --> 21:48.375
- I know. It's crazy.
Or perfect.
- Yeah.

21:50.250 --> 21:54.208
I'm going to be up
all night making these.

21:55.208 --> 21:57.208
"Single and successful
Deena Greco."

21:58.542 --> 22:00.083
Did you tell them
that you were single?

22:00.083 --> 22:02.500
Did you make a point of it?

22:02.500 --> 22:04.542
I don't know, Dave. Probably.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.917
I mean, I was,
you know, at the time.

22:07.917 --> 22:10.583
People are going to think
that we're divorced.

22:10.583 --> 22:12.125
Dave, it was a while ago.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.250
I don't want to think
about you as single.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.750
And I am not single.

22:16.750 --> 22:20.083
- I am dating secretly.
- Oh, yeah.

22:20.083 --> 22:22.750
- Remember?
- Oh, yeah. How could I forget?

22:26.542 --> 22:30.166
- You also remember
the field trip?
- How could I forget?

22:31.709 --> 22:33.583
It's going to be great.

22:33.583 --> 22:37.083
- Pick up the pace,
we're going to be late.
- Daddy, I can't go any faster.

22:37.083 --> 22:40.667
You can go a little bit faster.
Just go. Hey, sorry about that.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.500
So glad I took
the day off for this.

22:51.208 --> 22:55.375
My dad said that man hit that
man and he hits like a girl.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.709
There are ten, Nic.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.125
The same amount as when
we started this morning

23:07.125 --> 23:10.125
because we've only sold five
all day and no red velvets.

23:10.125 --> 23:14.125
What are we going to do?
I mean, we are going under
and we were never even over.

23:14.125 --> 23:17.083
- Just breathe. Have a cupcake.
- I can't.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.917
- Customer.
- Oh, hi! How are you?

23:19.917 --> 23:23.250
- Hi.
- Can I offer you a free sample?

23:23.250 --> 23:28.041
Wow. Mm! Mm!
Wow, this is amazing.

23:30.333 --> 23:33.417
I'm sorry. I came in here to get
some change to feed my meter.

23:41.709 --> 23:43.250
That's enough samples.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.792
[doorbell rings]

23:47.792 --> 23:50.375
You know that won't
be a problem, Mr. Green.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.709
Yeah, I get it. I will.

23:52.709 --> 23:57.333
Yes, I understand. I will.
All right, see you soon.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.458
- Hey, what's up?
- Hi.

24:02.834 --> 24:06.458
Hey, listen, I need
to take a rain check
on our little play date.

24:06.458 --> 24:09.709
I got a lot on my mind.
Not that I'm going
to talk to you about it.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.250
Well, that's good.

24:12.166 --> 24:15.000
OK. Um,
I'm going to go to work.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.500
Yeah, OK. Great. Hey, look.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.375
I've got a free room and dinner
at the Atheneum Hotel.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.917
If you wanted to join me
tonight, that'd be great.

24:22.917 --> 24:27.000
To the room? Yes. To dinner?
