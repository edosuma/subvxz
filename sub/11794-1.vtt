( music plays )

01:13.740 --> 01:16.076
   Hey everybody,
   attention please!

01:17.811 --> 01:19.612
 ( music stops,
 kids groan )

01:19.646 --> 01:23.650
No, no, no.
I just got a telegram.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.789
 All:
 Ooh!

01:31.491 --> 01:33.093
'''Dance Party'
has selected 'The Max'

01:33.093 --> 01:34.761
 for a televised dance contest

01:34.794 --> 01:37.897
 with all those great kids
 from Bayside, next Saturday.''

01:37.931 --> 01:40.100
  And it's signed...

01:40.133 --> 01:41.835
   ( mimicking voice )
   ''Casey Kasem!''

01:44.471 --> 01:48.775
   - Let me see that.
   - Cool, a dance contest!

01:48.808 --> 01:50.610
 How about you and I
 enter in the contest?

01:50.643 --> 01:53.113
 We could win it all.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.649
   Win? With you?
   Your feet need
   training wheels.

01:56.683 --> 01:59.786
 Winning, losing?
 Dancing is supposed to be fun.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.922
   Well, it will be fun...
   If Kelly dances with me.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.426
  Well,
  gee, guys, I'd love to be
  partners with both of you.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.895
 Why don't you just go
 with the best dancer?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.064
Hit it.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.066
( music plays )

02:28.081 --> 02:30.450
 ( cheering )

02:32.686 --> 02:35.155
  Wow, Slater, that was hot.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.756
   Are you kidding?

02:36.790 --> 02:40.794
 I moved better last summer
 when a bee flew in my shorts.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.930
I'm waiting, ''Preppie.''
Let's see what you got.

02:43.963 --> 02:47.801
   Move back, give him room.
   Hot feet coming through!

02:53.773 --> 02:57.143
 Slater, I could beat you
 now with three toes tied
  behind my back.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.746
   You think you're
   a better dancer than me?

02:59.779 --> 03:03.450
   Go practice first,
   then we'll have
   a real dance-off.

03:03.483 --> 03:06.386
 Wow, a dancing duel.
 How exciting!

03:10.724 --> 03:14.427
Hey Lisa, my horoscope says
we're destined
to dance together.

03:14.461 --> 03:17.130
 My horoscope says,
 ''Beware of dorks.''

03:19.599 --> 03:21.501
 Well, I'll protect you
 from them!

03:23.203 --> 03:26.439
 Hey Jessie, you want to be
 my partner for
 the dance contest?

03:26.473 --> 03:30.076
Gee Danny, I'd love to.

03:30.076 --> 03:32.712
  Actually, no. I don't believe
  in dance contests.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.781
  Then why don't we just
  skip the contest
  and kiss all night?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.083
  Bye, Danny.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.888
Hmm...

03:41.921 --> 03:44.524
Skip the date and start
with a goodnight kiss?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.626
  That Danny has good ideas.

03:50.096 --> 03:51.898
 Jessie:
 This cannot be right.

03:51.931 --> 03:55.568
 Tell me something is
 wrong with this scale before
 I hyperventilate.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.104
   The only thing
   wrong with that scale
   is the flake who's on it.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.510
I have grown an inch taller
since lunch.
I feel like a giant.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.679
 You are not a giant.

04:05.712 --> 04:08.515
You're a bright, sensitive,
popular girl.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.883
  Everyone ''looks up''
  to you.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.953
 Thanks a lot.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.055
   I mean,
   what's going to happen to me
   if I keep growing?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.957
 Stand tall. Be proud.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.559
 And practice your slam dunk.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.564
  Before I begin I have to make
  a very sad announcement.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.801
  Beethoven's alive?

04:27.834 --> 04:31.571
  Very amusing, Mr. Morris.
  Ha-ha ha-ha.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.076
   No, unfortunately
   I have to conduct

04:36.076 --> 04:39.579
   two music classes today,
   simultaneously.

04:39.612 --> 04:43.683
  Poor Mrs. Wickham slipped
  and got her head
  stuck in a tuba.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.786
 Well maybe they should get
 ''Fat Tommy'' to blow her out.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.288
   Good suggestion.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.091
  All right, people, today,
  we're going to play a piece

04:51.091 --> 04:54.094
   by Johann Sebastian Bach.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.096
   A piece?

04:56.096 --> 04:58.164
   Why can't we play
   the whole thing?

04:58.198 --> 05:02.535
 All right people,
 instruments up!
 One bar for nothing.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.905
   One, and two, and three,
   and...

05:05.939 --> 05:08.708
( playing out of tune )

05:11.911 --> 05:14.614
Oh! Thrilling!

05:15.915 --> 05:18.585
 Bach always gives me chills.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.823
 Keep playing my little
 wunderkind,

05:23.857 --> 05:25.892
 I'll be right Bach...
 I mean, back.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.065
 ( playing
 rock and roll style )

05:42.242 --> 05:45.945
( playing out of tune )

05:45.979 --> 05:50.116
  Beautiful, beautiful!
  I'm getting chills.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.318
   Are you feeling
   what I'm feeling?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.955
   Yes sir, it was
   the fish sticks at lunch.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.625
  You are what you eat,
  Powers.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.727
 All right, let me hear
 the horns!

06:00.760 --> 06:04.030
  ( plays sour note )

06:04.030 --> 06:06.666
   No chewing gum in class,
   Mr. Morris.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.769
   All right, piano!

06:09.803 --> 06:12.038
  ( off-key )

06:15.709 --> 06:18.878
 Elegantly played, Powers.
 Let's hear strings and flute!

06:18.912 --> 06:21.047
( strings out of tune )

06:21.081 --> 06:22.782
   You're moving me,
   you're moving me.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.754
( resuming rock style )

06:27.787 --> 06:29.622
  Slater:
  All right, move it, Jessie!

06:29.656 --> 06:31.658
 Kelly:
 Whoo! Shake it, girl!

06:40.300 --> 06:43.069
 Zack, why don't you show Kelly
 what a great dancer you are?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.604
   Not now, Screech.

06:44.637 --> 06:47.073
  Go ahead, Zack,
  I'm dying to see you dance.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.609
   Yeah, dazzle us,
   Preppie.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.915
   ( resuming
   off-key playing )

06:55.949 --> 06:58.218
 Wonderful. This is why
 I went into teaching.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.154
  Wonderful, wonderful.
  Now a little faster tempo.

07:01.187 --> 07:04.090
   <i>Aiiegro con moito.</i>
   <i>Poco, poco.</i> Yes.

07:04.124 --> 07:07.027
   Nice. A little brighter.
   Yes, nice.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.763
There you are.
Lovely.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.598
   ( playing fast )

07:11.631 --> 07:15.869
 Huh? Wait a minute.
 People, it's a little too...

07:15.902 --> 07:18.304
  Cut it back.
  That's a little
  too bright, people.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.241
 - Where are you taking me?
 - ( playing faster )

07:21.274 --> 07:23.810
Slow down, people!
It's too fast!

07:24.944 --> 07:26.880
People, please!

07:27.947 --> 07:30.116
   Surcease!

07:30.150 --> 07:33.119
   ( music stops abruptly )

07:33.153 --> 07:36.189
  Jessie, I'm in big trouble.

07:36.222 --> 07:39.859
  What'd you do? Try to sell
  your parents' house again?

07:39.893 --> 07:43.129
 I can't dance.
 I've been faking it for years.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.432
  lf you can't dance,
  why'd you challenge Slater?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.335
 If Kelly and Slater enter
 that contest,
 they're going to win.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.304
 That means their names
 are going to be on the trophy.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.841
 Together... touching.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.410
 - So?
 - So, I've got to stop them.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.279
   I can't allow them
   to ''name-neck.''

08:00.246 --> 08:02.349
 Ugh.

08:02.382 --> 08:05.318
 Jessie, you're a terrific
 dancer. Come on,
 you've got to help me.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.654
  Sure I'll help.
  Let's see a few
  of your best moves.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.022
   Come on.

08:11.424 --> 08:14.027
 ( snaps fingers
 off-rhythm )

08:18.198 --> 08:19.866
So, what do you think?

08:19.899 --> 08:21.701
 I think you should go
 with Screech.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.411
  - ( knocking )
  - Come in.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.148
Mr. Belding?
My name's Casey Kasem.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.057
  I'm here to talk about
  the dance party at The Max.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.126
''Details coming up,
right after I return.''

08:50.063 --> 08:52.065
 Just kidding.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.635
 Casey Kasem!
 Wow.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.170
I heard
about the dance party.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.139
   Is there anything
   I can do to help?

08:59.172 --> 09:01.474
 I'm the ''Big Bopper''
 around here.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.810
  Well actually,
  there is one thing.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.812
 Well, sit down
 and lay it upon me,
 ''Big 'C.'''

09:08.014 --> 09:11.685
 At ''Dance Party'' we try
 to get the support of
 the local schools.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.488
  Say no more. You want me
  to help you host the event.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.923
  That hadn't occurred to me.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.026
I know.

09:20.026 --> 09:24.164
 You heard about me winning
 the 1963 ''Chubby
 Checker Twist-Off.''

09:25.098 --> 09:26.866
Here's a little taste.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.570
Let's twist again,
like we did last summer

09:30.603 --> 09:34.507
Yeah, let's twist again,
like we did last year.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.549
  You want me to recreate
  that moment, right?

09:42.582 --> 09:47.053
Well actually, I was hoping
I could borrow
a school banner.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.122
  A banner?
  That's all?

09:50.056 --> 09:52.192
That's all, ''Bopper.''

09:52.225 --> 09:55.862
 Well okay, I'll present it
 to you on the show.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.764
 Gee, that'd be great.
 But I can take it right now.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.132
  ( snaps )
  I don't have one right now.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.268
 I'll bring it to you.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.673
 Oh, Zack, when are you
 going to have the dance-off?

10:06.706 --> 10:08.775
  I need to know
  who my partner is.

10:08.808 --> 10:12.078
Well,
Slater will be humiliated
the day after tomorrow.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.647
  Are you really
  that much better than him?

10:14.681 --> 10:17.751
Every summer
while the other kids
were playing baseball,

10:17.784 --> 10:19.519
 I was at dance camp.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.221
  Wow, I can't wait.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.925
  Why did I say that?

10:33.133 --> 10:35.135
 Zack:
 Whatever you're doing, don't.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.608
My darling, be my partner,
and this could be you.

10:51.618 --> 10:53.353
So what do you say?
Pick you up, seven-ish?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.955
 Forget it, Screech.
 She's already going with me.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.391
  Lisa, is that true?

10:58.425 --> 11:01.561
Sorry Screech, he asked me
this morning. Come on.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.700
  It's all your fault.
  I told you to let me lead.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.273
 ( dance music plays )

11:13.306 --> 11:16.109
- Whoo! You're doing great.
- I am?

11:16.943 --> 11:18.678
 Hey, I am, aren't I?

11:20.080 --> 11:22.115
Okay now, here's a new step
I just invented.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.222
   - Awesome.
   - Come on. Do it with me.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.191
Slater's going to freak out
when he sees this.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.292
 Whoo!

11:40.166 --> 11:41.835
   Let's take five.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.104
  Yeah, let's cool down.
  You're new at this.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.006
( music stops )

11:49.342 --> 11:50.877
Thanks.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.147
   You're a terrific dancer.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.117
 Yeah,
 well, I went to dance camp
 when I was a kid.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.184
   They actually have those?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.756
 I can't believe
 you're not
 entering the contest.

12:02.789 --> 12:04.391
 No big deal.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.726
  You're not into some
  strange religion, are you?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.829
  - No.
  - Then what's the problem?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.065
Zack, I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

12:15.802 --> 12:17.404
 Would you like to
 dance with me?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.872
 I can't.
 I'm bigger than you.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.074
 And I'm still growing
 at this very moment.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.214
  Too bad.
  Maybe I should have asked
  10 minutes ago.

12:30.216 --> 12:32.085
   Hey Jessie, let's dance.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.259
   I'm too big for you.
   I'm too big for everyone.

12:42.829 --> 12:46.199
- Jessie,
is that you up there?
- Yes, it's me.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.968
   You don't want
   to dance with me, do you?

12:49.002 --> 12:51.204
  I can't.
  Everybody will laugh at us.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.344
   Zack, I do have a problem...
   I'm too tall.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.746
 Well, I haven't noticed
 anyone measuring you lately.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.215
 That's because
 they can't reach me.

13:02.248 --> 13:06.152
  Zack, you don't know
  what it's like to
  be ''the freak''...

13:06.186 --> 13:10.190
   Taller than all the boys...
   The jokes,
   the looks, the whispers.

13:10.223 --> 13:14.060
  - Stop looking up at me!
  - Look at the bright side.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.096
  At least you're the first one
  to know when it rains.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.131
 Zack!

13:18.164 --> 13:20.767
 I'm sorry. Come on, there's
 lots of guys taller than you.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.801
   Name one.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.738
 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

13:38.418 --> 13:42.455
Come on, Screech, cheer up.
It can't be that bad.

13:42.489 --> 13:47.093
  It's no use trying
  to look stud-like anymore.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.929
 I think this time
 it's really over
 between me and Lisa.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.865
   Look, you can't give up.

13:51.898 --> 13:56.236
 I heard if Byron hadn't
 asked Lisa first,
 she'd have gone with you.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.304
 I know.
 I started that rumor.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.109
 Well then maybe you should
 start looking
 for someone else.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.779
  I can't.
  I've been crazy about her
  since kindergarten,

14:05.812 --> 14:09.082
  when I glued my face
  to the back of her sweater.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.851
   So you've been
   ''stuck on her''
   a long time, huh?

14:11.885 --> 14:16.056
   But what's the use?
   The story never changes.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.825
   There's
   the beautiful princess,
   the dashing frog,

14:18.858 --> 14:22.328
 and the wart he left behind.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.298
  Come on, Screech, I think
  you're being too
  hard on yourself.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.375
 - ( knocking )
 - Who is it?

14:36.976 --> 14:40.780
- Can I come in?
- Zack?

14:40.814 --> 14:44.417
 This is the first
 time in 11 years
 you've come through the door.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.753
   Well,
   there's a special reason.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.455
  Here.
  These are for you.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.523
Oh, they're beautiful.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.359
 We have the same kind
 growing in our yard.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.428
 Not anymore.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.266
 Well,
 this is just to say thanks
 for helping me.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.069
 We're not finished yet.
 We still have one more lesson.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.341
 - ( music plays )
 - Pretend I'm Kelly.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.378
   ''Oh Zack. Help me choose
   between you and Slater.''

15:23.089 --> 15:24.424
Voila!

15:51.551 --> 15:53.953
Lisa, what happened
to you?

15:53.987 --> 15:56.089
I kicked the TV
and sprained my ankle.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.224
 Why?

15:58.258 --> 16:01.428
 Watching the new
 Revlon commercial, they
 discontinued my nail polish.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.830
  That was a dumb thing
  to do.

16:03.863 --> 16:06.533
  Where were you
  ''Miss Pretty Pants,''
  when I needed that advice?

16:06.566 --> 16:09.836
Lisa, this is terrible.
I feel awful.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.072
   Don't worry about it, Byron.
   I'll be okay.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.907
Yeah, but can you dance
on that ankle?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.809
   Well, the doctor said
   there's a chance.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.445
 ''A chance''?

16:18.478 --> 16:22.382
 Well, I can't take
 that chance. I really want to
 win this contest.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.818
  Byron, what are you saying?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.419
I'm going to have to go
with my back-up,
Didi Garrison.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.091
  How could you do that
  to me?

16:31.124 --> 16:33.159
   Hey, let's ''pants'' him.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.830
 Better start running now,
 punk, or there's going to
be a ''full moon.''

16:36.863 --> 16:39.566
 Yeah, and don't show your face
 around here again!

16:39.599 --> 16:43.103
Hold me back, Slater!
Hold me back!
No one hurts my woman!

16:45.472 --> 16:48.375
  He's a fool, Lisa.
  You're hot no matter what.

16:48.408 --> 16:51.077
 You're strange,
 but thanks, Screech.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.380
 If you like strange,
 I'm your man.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.319
   - Well guys,
   it's the big moment.
   - What?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.789
 Zack, dance for me and help me
 choose between you and Slater.

17:08.595 --> 17:13.366
Kelly, do yourself a favor,
go with Slater.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.836
 - Zack, what are you saying?
 - Yeah,
 what are you up to, Preppie?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.372
Well, nothing.
I've decided to
go with Jessie.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.041
Jessie?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.511
  If that's what you
  really want, Zack.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.179
  Come on, Slater.
  Let's go practice.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.518
 - Will you go with me?
 - I'd love to be your partner.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.890
 Didn't your mother
 ever tell you not to slouch?

17:36.923 --> 17:39.325
  You're much prettier
  when you stand up straight.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.062
 - Thanks.
 - Oh, and one other thing...

17:42.062 --> 17:44.531
  Don't forget your high heels.
  You might need them.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.069
Can I have
your attention, please?

17:49.069 --> 17:51.271
( music stops )

17:51.304 --> 17:55.442
 It's now my
 pleasure to introduce
 the star of ''Dance Party.''

17:55.475 --> 17:58.945
  Let's give him
  a... ''Big hand.''

17:58.978 --> 18:01.681
   The golden voice
   from the Golden State...

18:01.715 --> 18:03.483
 ( mimicking voice )
 Casey Kasem!

18:03.516 --> 18:06.286
 ( applause )

18:06.319 --> 18:09.122
 Max, thank you.
 And thank you for letting us

18:09.155 --> 18:11.024
  use this great hangout
  for our dance
  contest this week.

18:11.057 --> 18:14.094
- Now, is everybody ready?
- ( cheers, applause )

18:16.196 --> 18:18.231
 You know, through the years,
 I've been to a lot of schools.

18:18.264 --> 18:22.202
  I've met a lot of principals,
  but I have never
  met a principal

18:22.235 --> 18:25.472
 who is so caring, so involved,
 and so hip,

18:25.505 --> 18:29.042
as your own
''Big Bopper'' Belding.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.044
 ( cheers, applause )

18:31.044 --> 18:33.146
Thank you, ''Caseman.''

18:33.179 --> 18:36.549
   - Now can I have the banner?
   - Of course.

18:36.583 --> 18:40.687
 One minute, everybody.
 Stand by and enjoy yourselves.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.290
  - I could twist and sing.
  - Let go of the microphone.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.162
   And now,
   the big moment...

18:49.195 --> 18:50.563
The announcement
of our three finalists

18:50.597 --> 18:53.233
 who will all dance for you
 one more time,

18:53.266 --> 18:55.402
  and then we'll
  pick the big winner
  with your applause.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.204
- Ready with
the applause meter?
- Ready, Casey.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.243
 Our first finalists,
 the exciting
 ''Spandex Twins''...

19:03.276 --> 19:06.012
Kelly Kapowski
and AC Slater.

19:06.046 --> 19:07.681
 ( applause,
 music plays )

19:14.054 --> 19:16.022
   ( crowd claps in rhythm )

19:36.509 --> 19:38.645
 All right, very good.

19:38.678 --> 19:42.349
 Now for finalists number two,
 the ''Powerhouse Preppies,''

19:42.382 --> 19:44.751
   welcome Zack Morris
   and Jessie Spano.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.619
 ( applause,
 music plays )

20:13.747 --> 20:16.716
   All right,
   now for our final couple,

20:16.750 --> 20:20.387
with a new dance
they've invented
called ''The Sprain,''

20:20.420 --> 20:23.289
 Screech Powers
 and Lisa Turtle.
 Bring 'em on.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.325
 ( applause,
 music plays )

21:10.637 --> 21:13.173
  ( applause rises )

21:15.675 --> 21:18.478
 Hey, there is no doubt
 about it.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.348
We have a winner.
It is Screech and Lisa!

21:21.381 --> 21:23.316
  ( cheers )

21:23.350 --> 21:25.352
  All right.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.421
 Well, that's a ''good night''
 from us here at ''Dance
 Party,'' everybody.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.490
  Till next time,
  this is Casey Kasem saying,

21:30.523 --> 21:33.560
 ''Keep your feet on the ground
 and keep reaching
 for the stars.''

21:33.593 --> 21:37.464
Come on,
everybody, let's do...
''The Sprain''!

21:38.932 --> 21:41.234
  ( music continues )

21:41.267 --> 21:42.669
Boy: Work, Casey!

21:46.840 --> 21:49.309
  ( Instrumental
  theme music plays )
