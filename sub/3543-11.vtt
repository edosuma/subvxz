WEBVTT

00:00.685 --> 00:03.756
My name is Elena Gilbert,
and I'm a vampire.

00:03.778 --> 00:07.346
I'm learning how to survive,
but there are complications.

00:07.348 --> 00:09.281
I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.

00:09.283 --> 00:10.449
You know what would make me happy?

00:10.451 --> 00:13.469
That what you actually
felt for me was real.

00:13.471 --> 00:15.788
How together are they?

00:18.708 --> 00:20.008
But there's hope now.

00:20.010 --> 00:21.910
Tell him what the hunter
told you the tattoo leads to.

00:21.912 --> 00:23.595
He said there was a cure.

00:23.597 --> 00:25.764
And we're not
the only ones who want it...

00:25.766 --> 00:27.766
I want to ram it down Niklaus' throat.

00:27.768 --> 00:29.268
But uncovering it comes with a price.

00:29.270 --> 00:30.686
What do you know about Silas?

00:30.688 --> 00:32.470
He's the world's first immortal being,

00:32.473 --> 00:34.857
who just happens to be
imprisoned with the cure.

00:34.859 --> 00:36.275
You said it yourself, right?

00:36.277 --> 00:38.110
Whoever finds the cure first
gets to decide

00:38.112 --> 00:39.228
what to do with it.

00:39.230 --> 00:40.696
So what do you say, partners?

00:40.698 --> 00:42.648
The race for the cure has begun,

00:42.650 --> 00:44.616
but how far will we
have to go to find it?

00:44.618 --> 00:47.786
I was beginning to worry you
boys wouldn't find the place.

00:47.788 --> 00:48.937
Did you kill all these people?

00:48.939 --> 00:51.039
Killing them is your job.

01:13.646 --> 01:14.963
Unh!

01:14.965 --> 01:16.464
Agh!

01:21.304 --> 01:23.489
No way.
I'm not doing it.

01:23.491 --> 01:25.357
What makes you think you have a choice?

01:25.359 --> 01:28.310
You have to kill vampires to
complete the hunter's mark.

01:28.312 --> 01:29.811
Mark equals cure.

01:29.813 --> 01:31.947
You're in a bar full
of almost vampires,

01:31.949 --> 01:33.648
so get your hunt on.

01:33.650 --> 01:35.751
Screw you. You said I
wouldn't have to kill

01:35.753 --> 01:36.919
any innocent people.

01:36.921 --> 01:39.004
Jeremy, they're not people.

01:39.006 --> 01:41.123
Enough! Have at it,
or else.

01:41.125 --> 01:44.343
I don't take orders from you, dick.

01:44.345 --> 01:46.879
Hunters can't be compelled.

01:50.183 --> 01:53.001
You're right.
I can't compel you,

01:53.003 --> 01:54.887
but if your conscience
is getting in the way,

01:54.889 --> 01:57.306
then allow me to make this easy for you

01:57.308 --> 01:59.641
because I can compel them.

02:03.062 --> 02:04.863
I'm gonna give you a
two-minute head start.

02:04.865 --> 02:07.499
Then I'm gonna send every
vampire in here after you.

02:07.501 --> 02:12.070
You kill them, or they
kill your friend... Matt.

02:12.072 --> 02:13.121
Wait a second.

02:13.123 --> 02:15.707
No, no. You turn them,
he kills them.

02:15.709 --> 02:16.992
That was the deal, Klaus.

02:16.994 --> 02:18.877
I'm taking artistic license.

02:18.879 --> 02:21.196
You know he can't take them
all on at the same time.

02:21.198 --> 02:23.415
With you as his coach, he'll be fine.

02:23.417 --> 02:26.418
It's Matt I'm worried about.

02:26.420 --> 02:29.304
Ehh.

02:29.306 --> 02:30.889
Jeremy, go get
the weapons out of the car.

02:30.891 --> 02:32.724
I'll be right behind you.

02:34.093 --> 02:35.510
Go with him.

02:36.896 --> 02:38.564
If I hear an engine start,

02:38.566 --> 02:40.482
I'll kill Matt myself!

02:44.237 --> 02:46.054
Are you ok?

02:46.056 --> 02:47.389
Yeah. I just
need a second.

02:47.391 --> 02:48.824
We don't have a second.

02:48.826 --> 02:50.943
They can smell your blood.
We need to go.

02:53.864 --> 02:56.031
Don't hesitate.
You're lucky it was me.

02:56.033 --> 02:57.866
Otherwise, you two would be dead.

02:57.868 --> 02:59.034
You set us up.

02:59.036 --> 03:00.335
I'm was trying to get
this thing over with.

03:00.337 --> 03:01.837
You're the one that pissed off Klaus.

03:01.839 --> 03:04.039
Now you have to fight
your way out of it.

03:04.041 --> 03:05.757
Where are the other vampires?

03:05.759 --> 03:07.259
They're newbies. They're still
trying to figure out how to track,

03:07.261 --> 03:10.545
which means you have two
seconds to get ready to fight.

03:10.547 --> 03:11.930
The lake house is this way.

03:11.932 --> 03:13.849
If we can get there, they
won't be able to get inside.

03:13.851 --> 03:16.551
Wait. You want to run?

03:16.553 --> 03:19.754
They're gonna kill Matt.

03:19.756 --> 03:22.474
Fine. Get out of here.
I'll slow them down.

03:38.074 --> 03:39.825
Jeremy, where are you?

03:39.827 --> 03:41.793
Keep going.
We're almost there.

03:54.507 --> 03:56.124
Are you ok?

03:57.510 --> 03:59.061
Oh, my God.

03:59.063 --> 04:01.063
Get to the house!
Hurry!

04:08.071 --> 04:09.821
Jeremy, what's going on?

04:09.823 --> 04:11.306
They're coming.

04:17.940 --> 04:23.234
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

04:28.958 --> 04:30.792
Sun's up.

04:30.794 --> 04:32.260
They're long gone.

04:34.347 --> 04:36.765
What the hell were you thinking?

04:36.767 --> 04:39.167
All I asked you to do was
to teach him how to fight.

04:39.169 --> 04:40.769
He's not the best student in the world.

04:40.771 --> 04:42.304
Wait. Now this is
my fault?

04:42.306 --> 04:44.723
Stop talking.

04:44.725 --> 04:46.858
Look. I know
you're angry,

04:46.860 --> 04:48.727
but my way was the easiest, fastest,

04:48.729 --> 04:51.313
and safest way to complete his mark

04:51.315 --> 04:52.514
to get you the cure.

04:52.516 --> 04:54.566
I don't care about the cure, Damon,

04:54.568 --> 04:57.352
not if it means putting the
people that I love in danger.

04:57.354 --> 04:59.488
Hey. There would
have been no danger

04:59.490 --> 05:01.306
if he hadn't gone all bleeding heart.

05:01.308 --> 05:03.158
He killed someone.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.043
These were innocent people.

05:05.045 --> 05:07.295
But the mark grew, didn't it?

05:10.216 --> 05:12.417
Ok. Look.
We need a plan.

05:12.419 --> 05:14.302
There's a group of compelled
vampires out there,

05:14.304 --> 05:16.088
and as soon as the sun goes down,

05:16.090 --> 05:17.339
they're gonna come after Matt,

05:17.341 --> 05:19.091
so we have to find
a away to protect him.

05:19.093 --> 05:22.177
Yes, I know, but there
will be no problem

05:22.179 --> 05:25.814
when big Jer and I here go
on a hunting expedition.

05:25.816 --> 05:30.268
Elena, I know it's tragic, I get it,

05:30.270 --> 05:32.387
but we also agree
that he had to kill them.

05:32.389 --> 05:34.189
Now we have added incentive,

05:34.191 --> 05:36.775
so you take the least
most valuable player home,

05:36.777 --> 05:39.244
and Jeremy and I will finish this.

05:39.246 --> 05:40.445
I'm sorry. Are you
saying that I should

05:40.447 --> 05:41.947
leave him here with you?

05:41.949 --> 05:44.366
Trust me.

05:44.368 --> 05:47.753
I will keep him safe, ok?

05:57.630 --> 06:01.082
Ahem. I know you were, uh,
daggered for a little while,

06:01.084 --> 06:04.436
but, uh, knocking is still a thing.

06:04.438 --> 06:07.355
So is writing in your diary apparently.

06:07.357 --> 06:09.024
I'm just checking for doubts.

06:09.026 --> 06:11.143
You can never be too cautious
when it comes to love.

06:11.145 --> 06:12.760
One minute, you're begging me

06:12.762 --> 06:14.029
to compel Elena from your mind,

06:14.031 --> 06:15.930
and the next, I'm up coffin creek

06:15.932 --> 06:17.098
with a dagger in my back.

06:17.100 --> 06:20.118
Right. Well, you can
read it all you want.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.453
I'm done with her.

06:21.455 --> 06:25.273
Until we find the cure, right?

06:25.275 --> 06:26.708
Hey. I'm talking
to you.

06:26.710 --> 06:29.277
Oh, I know you are.
I'm ignoring you.

06:29.279 --> 06:30.945
Look. We're at a bit
of a disadvantage

06:30.947 --> 06:32.414
in this whole race for the cure.

06:32.416 --> 06:34.166
Team Klaus has Jeremy the hunter,

06:34.168 --> 06:36.051
team Shane has Bonnie the witch.

06:36.053 --> 06:38.086
If you're here to remind me
of our last place status,

06:38.088 --> 06:39.304
I'm very well aware.

06:39.306 --> 06:41.122
Actually I have a plan.

06:41.124 --> 06:42.674
The cure is buried with Silas,

06:42.676 --> 06:45.627
that ancient evil guy my
brother Kol is afraid of.

06:45.629 --> 06:48.146
Shane was so eager
to prove his existence

06:48.148 --> 06:51.399
that he gave away that he has on
of the keys to resurrecting him,

06:51.401 --> 06:52.967
his headstone.

06:52.969 --> 06:55.437
I see. You want to
steal it.

06:55.439 --> 06:59.191
Yes. And then team Shane will
have to join team Rebekah,

06:59.193 --> 07:00.992
and team Klaus will be
left out in the cold

07:00.994 --> 07:02.577
where he belongs.

07:11.170 --> 07:12.387
You know, just because
your eyes are closed

07:12.389 --> 07:13.622
doesn't mean you're meditating.

07:13.624 --> 07:15.507
Come on.
Use your breath.

07:15.509 --> 07:17.792
Use your breath to calm your nerves.

07:17.794 --> 07:19.494
Great.

07:19.496 --> 07:21.379
So now I can't even meditate right?

07:21.381 --> 07:22.881
What else can I fail?

07:22.883 --> 07:24.299
Bonnie, you didn't fail.

07:24.301 --> 07:26.234
I did an expression spell
that almost killed April.

07:26.236 --> 07:27.936
Exactly. Almost.

07:27.938 --> 07:29.137
Failing would have been
actually killing her.

07:29.139 --> 07:31.690
You got, like,
a d-minus.

07:31.692 --> 07:33.191
It's not funny.

07:33.193 --> 07:34.526
I have all this power now,
and I'm worried

07:34.528 --> 07:37.863
I won't be able to control it.

07:37.865 --> 07:40.782
Bonnie, look at me.

07:43.569 --> 07:46.187
I'm here with you.

07:46.189 --> 07:48.623
You don't have anything to worry about.

07:48.625 --> 07:52.527
You are strong, you are focused.

07:52.529 --> 07:55.914
You are in complete control.

07:55.916 --> 07:59.000
You're here with me.

07:59.002 --> 08:02.370
I'm in complete control.

08:04.708 --> 08:05.757
Sheriff?

08:05.759 --> 08:06.925
Bonnie, I'm gonna need you to go.

08:06.927 --> 08:08.093
What the hell are you doing?

08:08.095 --> 08:10.011
We need to ask you a few questions.

08:10.013 --> 08:11.313
Are you serious? I'm
sure I can answer

08:11.315 --> 08:12.731
without the handcuffs.

08:12.733 --> 08:14.232
Come on. This isn't
even your jurisdiction.

08:14.234 --> 08:16.184
Well, then I guess we better
get you to Mystic Falls asap.

08:16.186 --> 08:17.435
Wait. Why are you
doing this?

08:17.437 --> 08:19.104
That's something you
should ask your dad.

08:23.075 --> 08:24.892
You really think they
went back to the bar?

08:24.894 --> 08:26.561
Where else are they gonna go?

08:26.563 --> 08:28.029
It's all cabins and vacation homes.

08:28.031 --> 08:29.698
They can't get in anywhere.

08:33.235 --> 08:36.504
All right.
There you go.

08:36.506 --> 08:41.543
Fine. Let's get this
over with.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.077
Listen. Just go
one at a time,

08:43.078 --> 08:45.046
only shoot for the heart,

08:45.048 --> 08:46.765
don't hesitate,

08:46.767 --> 08:48.300
and don't miss.

08:48.302 --> 08:49.517
Save the teaching moment.

08:49.519 --> 08:50.936
Elena's not here.

08:50.938 --> 08:53.087
You don't have to pretend like
you give a damn about me.

08:53.089 --> 08:56.591
I'm trying to keep you alive, dumbass.

08:56.593 --> 08:57.859
Come on.

09:24.887 --> 09:26.638
Something's not right.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.191
Ahh.

09:51.146 --> 09:54.315
Looks like we're gonna have
to find some new vampires.

09:54.317 --> 09:56.150
What a waste.

09:56.152 --> 09:57.585
What the hell happened?

09:57.587 --> 09:59.487
I confess.

09:59.489 --> 10:02.040
I did it.

10:02.042 --> 10:03.825
Kol.

10:03.827 --> 10:05.176
Jeremy, good to see you, mate.

10:05.178 --> 10:06.845
Sorry about the mess.

10:06.847 --> 10:08.380
It was a little crowded when I arrived,

10:08.382 --> 10:12.384
and I prefer more intimate gatherings.

10:12.386 --> 10:14.686
We 3 need to have a little chat.

10:23.594 --> 10:24.911
Care for a drink?

10:24.913 --> 10:27.935
He's underage, and I don't like you,

10:27.962 --> 10:29.628
so let's just cut to it.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.898
My brother bragged about his plan

10:31.900 --> 10:33.716
to complete Jeremy's hunter's mark.

10:33.718 --> 10:35.468
It was easy enough
to track this lot down.

10:35.470 --> 10:37.737
They were all hiding in the shadows.

10:37.739 --> 10:40.106
Now killing young vampires is easy

10:40.108 --> 10:42.575
or old ones for that matter.

10:42.577 --> 10:44.243
Why? What's it to you
either way?

10:44.245 --> 10:46.078
Because, you fools, in your
zeal to find the cure,

10:46.080 --> 10:48.531
you risk waking someone very dangerous.

10:48.533 --> 10:52.535
Oh. You must be talking
about Silas.

10:52.537 --> 10:53.819
What do you know of him?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.421
Nothing. Don't want to.
Not our problem.

10:55.423 --> 10:57.757
Isn't it?

10:57.759 --> 10:59.842
A few hundred years back,
I came across a group

10:59.844 --> 11:01.093
that worshiped Silas.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.162
His followers told me
that he would rise again,

11:03.164 --> 11:06.215
and when he did, he would
trigger the end of all time.

11:06.217 --> 11:07.884
You know, being an immortal,
you can see why I'm opposed

11:07.886 --> 11:10.269
to time's ending.

11:10.271 --> 11:12.288
I murdered all of them,

11:12.290 --> 11:15.391
and now here you are
willing to risk raising him

11:15.393 --> 11:17.143
in your search for the cure.

11:17.145 --> 11:19.345
I can't exactly sit back
and let that happen, can I?

11:19.347 --> 11:20.980
We're not gonna back off the
cure because you were told

11:20.982 --> 11:23.682
one too many scary
bedtime stories, you idiot.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.319
Jeremy, we were mates in Colorado.

11:26.321 --> 11:27.737
You're a smart lad.

11:27.739 --> 11:30.189
Why don't you call off this
imbecilic treasure hunt?

11:30.191 --> 11:33.709
I'm not calling anything off, mate.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.997
Well, I could kill you,

11:37.999 --> 11:40.583
but then I'd have to deal
with the hunter's curse,

11:40.585 --> 11:43.219
and I... I don't particularly
feel like being haunted

11:43.221 --> 11:45.871
for the next century.

11:47.058 --> 11:48.174
Better idea.

11:48.176 --> 11:49.642
I'll just rip off your arms.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.680
Jeremy, run!

12:07.411 --> 12:10.930
Well... Headstone's
not here.

12:10.932 --> 12:12.131
Don't ripper out on me.

12:12.133 --> 12:14.500
We'll find it.

12:14.502 --> 12:17.236
Oh, you're all bottled up.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.171
You need a release.
Maybe we can find you

12:19.173 --> 12:21.541
a voodoo doll or something.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.295
Ah. This should
do the trick.

12:26.297 --> 12:28.097
Exactly what you need.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.603
The Professor's stash of herbs.

12:33.605 --> 12:35.588
Not interested.

12:35.590 --> 12:38.975
What happened to you? You were
so much fun in the twenties.

12:38.977 --> 12:43.596
I was a psychotic killer with
no emotions in the 1920s.

12:43.598 --> 12:44.930
You may have been a killer,

12:44.932 --> 12:47.766
but you were far from
emotionless, Stefan.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.269
You had a blast.
I know you remember.

12:50.271 --> 12:54.440
The jazz, the booze, our
little table at Gloria's.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.328
Don't make me compel it out of you.

13:02.799 --> 13:06.285
All right. Um...

13:06.287 --> 13:07.920
I guess we had a little bit of fun.

13:07.922 --> 13:10.423
Thank you. So now that
we've established

13:10.425 --> 13:12.925
that fun is, in fact, possible,

13:12.927 --> 13:17.496
maybe you'd like to start having some.

13:17.498 --> 13:19.298
Don't worry about the Professor.

13:19.300 --> 13:22.134
He won't be back any time soon.
I made sure of that.

13:29.610 --> 13:32.695
You're accusing me of
orchestrating a mass murder?

13:32.697 --> 13:34.647
Do you know how ridiculous that sounds.

13:34.649 --> 13:36.749
It's Mystic Falls.

13:36.751 --> 13:38.784
It's actually one of the least
ridiculous things I've heard.

13:38.786 --> 13:41.153
He already explained this, dad.

13:41.155 --> 13:43.506
Pastor young came to him for help.
He was crazy.

13:43.508 --> 13:44.990
No. Hew was
grief-stricken,

13:44.992 --> 13:46.509
and Shane took advantage of it.

13:46.511 --> 13:48.377
And somehow talked him into
killing a house full of people.

13:48.379 --> 13:49.962
It doesn't make any sense.

13:49.964 --> 13:51.764
I've met people like this, Bonnie.

13:51.766 --> 13:53.466
They're fast-talking, they're
charismatic, they're manipulators.

13:53.468 --> 13:55.267
They prey
on the weak-minded.

13:55.269 --> 14:00.606
Mmm. And you're worried
that's what he's doing to me.

14:00.608 --> 14:02.508
That's why you brought
him in, isn't it?

14:02.510 --> 14:05.861
No. We brought him in because
April young told us what he did.

14:05.863 --> 14:07.513
Rebekah Mikaelson confirmed it.

14:07.515 --> 14:09.649
He confessed to her.

14:09.651 --> 14:10.783
I'm going in there.

14:10.785 --> 14:12.034
Bonnie, no, you're not.

14:12.036 --> 14:17.123
If he's gonna tell anyone
what he did, it's me.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.525
Unless of course you think
I'm too weak-minded.

14:27.217 --> 14:30.252
Bonnie, now is not the time.

14:30.254 --> 14:31.921
Let her talk.

14:36.093 --> 14:37.560
I think your dad's
confused about the format

14:37.562 --> 14:39.345
of the parent-teacher
conference.

14:39.347 --> 14:40.879
I'm so sorry.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.516
Rebekah told them you confessed.

14:43.518 --> 14:45.217
I know she's lying.

14:47.654 --> 14:51.824
You know, the truth is, she's not.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.331
I'm so sorry. Listen.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.117
When I asked you to stay to
Jeremy, I never thought...

15:01.119 --> 15:03.586
what did you expect, Elena?

15:03.588 --> 15:04.837
It's Damon.

15:04.839 --> 15:06.238
I never wanted anyone to get hurt.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.741
Well, then you shouldn't
have left him in charge.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.180
Look. I'm sorry. I know you
didn't have a choice...

15:14.182 --> 15:15.681
sire bond and all.

15:15.683 --> 15:17.633
Sire bond doesn't work like that.

15:17.635 --> 15:20.469
All I know, Elena, is that the old you

15:20.471 --> 15:22.588
would have never left
Jeremy with Damon,

15:22.590 --> 15:25.808
especially after
what happened last night.

15:30.947 --> 15:32.097
Jeremy?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.265
Elena, we're in trouble.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

15:36.037 --> 15:37.269
Where's Damon?

15:37.271 --> 15:38.704
Listen to me.
Kol attacked us.

15:38.706 --> 15:42.208
I barely got away, but he's got Damon.

15:42.210 --> 15:46.445
A bit ironic you coming to me for help.

15:46.447 --> 15:50.833
Weren't your friends just trying
to bury me in a cement tomb?

15:50.835 --> 15:52.635
This is your fault.

15:52.637 --> 15:55.254
You started this when you forced
Jeremy to kill those vampires.

15:55.256 --> 15:58.224
And my little brat of a brother
has gone and made things worse.

15:58.226 --> 16:00.826
Well, he never did like Damon.

16:00.828 --> 16:04.764
I suppose I should do
something, shouldn't I?

16:04.766 --> 16:05.965
Call him off, Klaus.

16:05.967 --> 16:10.402
You are in no position
to make demands, love.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.856
Whilst I'd like to cure you
to make more hybrids,

16:13.858 --> 16:15.908
I do have other reasons
for finding the cure,

16:15.910 --> 16:17.927
not the least of which is destroying it

16:17.929 --> 16:20.529
so you lot can't use it against me.

16:20.531 --> 16:23.482
Whatever our differences,

16:23.484 --> 16:26.819
we want the same thing.

16:26.821 --> 16:30.256
Please. Klaus,
I'm begging you.

16:41.218 --> 16:43.035
Little brother.

16:43.037 --> 16:45.471
Just two days home, and I'm
told you've already gone

16:45.473 --> 16:47.022
and made a mess.

16:47.024 --> 16:49.191
Come on, Nik. I was
only having some fun.

16:49.193 --> 16:51.727
Those vampires were for my hunter.

16:51.729 --> 16:53.529
I'll make some more. There's
no shortage of people.

16:53.531 --> 16:56.365
Where's Damon Salvatore.

16:56.367 --> 16:58.067
I gave him a good and proper beating

16:58.069 --> 16:59.735
just for old time's sake.

16:59.737 --> 17:01.570
Yes. Well, you've had
your fun.

17:01.572 --> 17:03.839
Now let him go and come home.

17:03.841 --> 17:06.992
Avoid any more trouble, or you'll
find yourself back in a box.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.993
Hey. No need to be
nasty about it.

17:08.996 --> 17:11.079
On the contrary, I find
nastiness to be essential

17:11.082 --> 17:14.465
whenever my siblings
try to sabotage me.

17:14.468 --> 17:17.303
Listen closely, Kol.

17:17.305 --> 17:20.172
Stay away from the Gilbert boy.

17:20.174 --> 17:21.924
Understand?

17:21.925 --> 17:24.393
Fine.
I won't touch him.

17:24.395 --> 17:25.877
You have my word.

17:30.684 --> 17:32.184
Very good, darling.

17:32.186 --> 17:34.320
Now stab yourself a little bit further.

17:40.660 --> 17:44.113
If you're gonna kill me,
do it like a man.

17:44.115 --> 17:45.497
I don't want to kill you.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.199
I just wanted to make sure
you could be compelled.

17:47.201 --> 17:49.668
I'm gonna rip out your spleen.

17:49.670 --> 17:52.037
You ought to be thanking me.

17:52.039 --> 17:54.256
You don't really want the cure found.

17:54.258 --> 17:57.593
You fancy Elena. I mean, even
more now that she's a vampire.

17:57.595 --> 17:59.845
Admit it.

17:59.847 --> 18:01.630
The last vestige of her humanity

18:01.632 --> 18:05.751
is her annoying little brother Jeremy,

18:05.753 --> 18:09.939
and deep, deep down, I bet you
want him dead, don't you?

18:09.941 --> 18:14.143
Nope.

18:14.145 --> 18:15.861
You're lying.

18:15.863 --> 18:18.364
I bet you'd love to rip
his head right off...

18:20.233 --> 18:22.201
And I'm gonna give you your wish.

18:27.824 --> 18:29.808
You're not gonna remember what I say,

18:29.810 --> 18:32.628
but you're going to
find Jeremy Gilbert,

18:32.630 --> 18:34.914
and when you do,

18:34.916 --> 18:36.632
you're going to kill him.

18:45.836 --> 18:47.870
Jeremy, it's over.

18:47.872 --> 18:49.172
You can put all this away.

18:49.174 --> 18:50.757
Klaus still wants me
to finish the mark.

18:50.759 --> 18:52.225
He's not gonna stop.

18:52.227 --> 18:54.060
Ok. Well, Damon's
gonna be back soon,

18:54.062 --> 18:55.478
and then we can figure something out.

18:55.480 --> 18:56.846
Seriously?
You still trust Damon?

18:56.848 --> 18:58.264
He saved your life.

18:58.266 --> 18:59.766
He saved the map to the cure.

18:59.768 --> 19:01.550
He couldn't care less about me.

19:01.552 --> 19:03.102
I care about you.

19:03.104 --> 19:04.654
Don't.

19:04.656 --> 19:06.439
Whatever's inside of me
that makes me want to hunt,

19:06.441 --> 19:09.492
right now it's on overdrive.

19:09.494 --> 19:11.160
Jeremy.

19:16.366 --> 19:20.419
I'm sorry.

19:20.421 --> 19:23.089
I know what I have to do, Elena.

19:23.091 --> 19:24.791
I really want to get that cure for you,

19:24.793 --> 19:26.909
but...

19:26.911 --> 19:30.546
I just... I don't how
I'm gonna do this.

19:36.371 --> 19:39.138
So much random crap in here.

19:39.140 --> 19:41.774
Crap, maybe.
Random, no.

19:41.776 --> 19:44.777
Looks like Shane has
a bit of an afterlife fetish.

19:44.779 --> 19:48.648
Hopi prayer feathers, the
han dynasty soul vase,

19:48.650 --> 19:51.484
and that is a polynesian
sacrificial knife.

19:51.486 --> 19:54.153
Brutal way to die, but at
least you appease the gods.

19:54.155 --> 19:56.622
Since when did you become
such an artifact expert?

19:56.624 --> 19:59.292
I enjoy other cultures, Stefan.

19:59.294 --> 20:01.160
I know that might be hard
for you to understand

20:01.162 --> 20:04.881
considering you dated a child
who only thinks about herself.

20:08.886 --> 20:12.655
Still a sensitive subject, I see.

20:12.657 --> 20:15.291
Do you know why I wouldn't
compel Elena from your memory?

20:15.293 --> 20:17.059
Because you wanted me to suffer.

20:17.061 --> 20:20.429
I did. It's the only
way you'll learn.

20:20.431 --> 20:22.431
It took me a thousand years

20:22.433 --> 20:24.066
and hundreds of betrayals to realize

20:24.068 --> 20:28.487
that love, caring ruins you.

20:28.489 --> 20:30.323
Hmm.

20:30.325 --> 20:31.974
That's awfully bleak.

20:31.976 --> 20:34.410
Quite the opposite.

20:34.412 --> 20:36.979
It's liberating actually.

20:36.981 --> 20:41.167
You know why we had so much
fun in the twenties, Stefan?

20:41.169 --> 20:43.002
Because we didn't care.

20:43.004 --> 20:46.488
We just did what felt good...

20:46.490 --> 20:52.661
drinking, feeding, sex.

20:52.663 --> 20:56.382
The sex wasn't good
because we didn't care.

20:56.384 --> 20:59.602
It was good because you're crazy.

20:59.604 --> 21:03.356
Crazy sex is always good.

21:03.358 --> 21:05.775
You were hardly the model of sanity.

21:10.397 --> 21:13.649
Stop... Caring.

21:43.046 --> 21:45.547
Good. You found it.

21:45.549 --> 21:47.483
Question is who are you?

21:53.023 --> 21:55.691
What happened?
Are you ok?

21:55.693 --> 21:58.861
Kol happened.

21:58.863 --> 22:00.229
Thank God you both got away.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.064
If Kol had taken Jeremy.

22:02.066 --> 22:04.033
Is here? I just want to
talk to him really fast.

22:04.035 --> 22:07.069
He's at the grill. He
wanted to check on Matt.

22:07.071 --> 22:08.237
Well, I should go apologize to him.

22:08.239 --> 22:11.740
I was... I was pretty
tough on him today.

22:18.849 --> 22:23.102
Told my dad to give us a minute.

22:23.104 --> 22:26.605
Camera's off.

22:26.607 --> 22:29.308
You can talk.

22:29.310 --> 22:30.609
Are you sure about that?

22:30.611 --> 22:33.195
Yeah. I don't lie.
I'm not you.

22:33.197 --> 22:34.981
Look. I always gonna tell you the truth.
I just kept putting it off

22:34.983 --> 22:36.365
because I was worried how you'd react.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.234
Bad. That's how
I react to murder.

22:38.236 --> 22:42.321
I'm not a killer, Bonnie.

22:42.323 --> 22:43.656
Pastor young was depressed...

22:43.658 --> 22:44.991
I've heard this.
Skip to the part

22:44.993 --> 22:47.243
where you convince him
to massacre 11 people.

22:47.245 --> 22:49.245
It wasn't a massacre.
It was a ritual.

22:49.247 --> 22:51.080
It was something
necessary to raise Silas

22:51.082 --> 22:53.615
and get the cure that your
friends so desperately want.

22:53.617 --> 22:55.501
If they knew people had to die...

22:55.503 --> 22:56.719
it doesn't matter if they die.

22:56.721 --> 23:00.639
Silas will bring them back.

23:00.641 --> 23:02.258
You're crazy.

23:02.260 --> 23:03.509
I'm not crazy.

23:03.511 --> 23:05.261
I'm just passionate.

23:05.263 --> 23:08.481
You're full on crazy.

23:11.985 --> 23:15.404
Do you remember our first session?

23:15.406 --> 23:17.356
It was about your grams, right?

23:17.358 --> 23:20.393
You thought every time you did
magic you were causing her pain.

23:24.164 --> 23:26.999
Aren't you curious
what's happening to her now?

23:29.286 --> 23:31.470
Wouldn't you like to see her again?

23:47.971 --> 23:50.439
Don't you ever take a night off?

23:50.441 --> 23:52.308
I took two days off to help you out

23:52.310 --> 23:53.976
at the lake house, remember?

23:53.978 --> 23:55.344
I almost got killed.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.812
Where's Jeremy?

23:56.814 --> 23:58.364
He's in the back I think.

23:58.366 --> 23:59.865
Hmm.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.153
Are you doing ok?

24:04.155 --> 24:06.872
Yeah. All things
considered.

24:23.873 --> 24:25.207
Damon.

24:28.545 --> 24:30.546
Are you all right?

24:30.548 --> 24:32.181
What's going on?

24:58.675 --> 25:00.593
Damon, what is wrong with you?

25:00.595 --> 25:02.261
It was Kol.

25:02.263 --> 25:04.746
He must have compelled me.

25:04.748 --> 25:07.933
If I find Jeremy...

25:07.935 --> 25:09.751
I might kill him.

25:27.472 --> 25:28.921
Jeremy...

25:29.655 --> 25:30.922
Get out of here!

25:30.924 --> 25:33.842
Do you hear me?
Don't stop.

25:33.844 --> 25:35.760
Kol compelled me.

25:35.762 --> 25:38.713
There's nothing I can do!

25:38.715 --> 25:40.432
You can't hide in here, Jer.

25:40.434 --> 25:42.517
If I find you, you're dead.

25:42.519 --> 25:44.386
Jeremy, are you listening to me?

25:44.388 --> 25:46.671
You better run!

25:46.673 --> 25:48.339
I am coming to kill you.

25:48.341 --> 25:50.559
You need to go now!

25:55.281 --> 25:58.182
All you have to do to make it stop

25:58.184 --> 26:00.202
is tell me who sent you.

26:04.373 --> 26:05.657
You're full of vervain,

26:05.659 --> 26:06.908
so I know you haven't been compelled.

26:06.910 --> 26:09.661
Or maybe somebody compelled him

26:09.663 --> 26:11.046
before he ingested it.

26:11.048 --> 26:12.447
He was after the headstone.

26:12.449 --> 26:13.882
We need to know who sent him.

26:13.884 --> 26:16.117
Ok. Fine. So we
take him home,

26:16.119 --> 26:18.220
wait till the vervain
is out of his system,

26:18.222 --> 26:21.172
and then compel him and get
whatever information we want.

26:21.174 --> 26:22.424
That's not a bad idea.

26:29.749 --> 26:31.316
He just bit off his own tongue.

26:31.318 --> 26:33.151
So he does know something.

26:43.696 --> 26:45.163
I guess he was compelled.

26:45.165 --> 26:47.032
Was it my bastard brother or yours?

26:47.034 --> 26:50.535
Maybe it's option number 3.

26:50.537 --> 26:52.403
There's another team in the race.

26:55.074 --> 26:56.458
You're saying if I help you

26:56.460 --> 26:59.844
raise Silas you can
bring my grams back?

26:59.846 --> 27:01.613
Don't play on my guilt, Shane.

27:01.615 --> 27:04.516
I'm not playing on anything.

27:04.518 --> 27:07.251
This is the truth.
You told me what happened.

27:07.253 --> 27:08.603
Your reckless use
of magic is the reason...

27:08.605 --> 27:09.854
don't.

27:09.856 --> 27:11.422
Is the reason those spirits

27:11.424 --> 27:13.391
are torturing her on the other side.
Don't.

27:13.393 --> 27:16.311
Hurting her again and again and again.

27:16.313 --> 27:17.979
I said don't!

27:17.981 --> 27:21.199
Unh!

27:21.201 --> 27:22.400
My hand!

27:25.105 --> 27:28.290
You can't stop, can you?

27:28.292 --> 27:31.275
All this power that you're feeling,

27:31.277 --> 27:34.329
you actually like it, don't you?

27:34.331 --> 27:38.282
Aah! Aah! Ugh.

27:38.284 --> 27:41.136
Look at yourself, Bonnie.
Look at yourself, Bonnie.

27:41.138 --> 27:43.454
Bonnie, what are you doing?

27:43.456 --> 27:45.623
Get out.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.842
Get out of here.
Bonnie, stop!

27:47.844 --> 27:49.394
You can't reason with her, mayor.
She's lost control.

27:49.396 --> 27:54.465
Bonnie, baby, baby.
Please.

27:54.467 --> 27:57.385
Do something!

27:57.387 --> 27:59.020
Bonnie...

27:59.022 --> 28:01.973
Bonnie, look at me!

28:01.975 --> 28:03.775
Now take a deep breath.

28:03.777 --> 28:07.078
I'm right here with you.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.031
You are in complete control.

28:13.085 --> 28:14.619
That's it.

28:32.605 --> 28:37.308
Your daughter...
Is a prodigy.

28:37.310 --> 28:40.729
With my guidance...

28:40.731 --> 28:43.848
She'll be one of the most
powerful witches in the world...

28:45.451 --> 28:49.788
But without it...
whew...

28:49.790 --> 28:52.073
she's a time bomb.

29:00.966 --> 29:04.586
Hello, Elena.

29:04.588 --> 29:06.204
What did you to Stefan?

29:06.206 --> 29:08.256
Rescued him from his old, dull life,

29:08.258 --> 29:09.557
but it keeps calling.

29:09.559 --> 29:11.375
Stefan's not in the
mood to talk right now.

29:11.377 --> 29:12.977
Then he can listen.

29:12.979 --> 29:14.846
I know might not care
about me right now, Stefan,

29:14.848 --> 29:17.232
but Kol compelled Damon to kill Jeremy.

29:17.234 --> 29:19.234
They're somewhere in
the tunnels, and I...

29:19.236 --> 29:20.652
it's one giant maze down here,

29:20.654 --> 29:23.822
and I can't find them, so if
you still care about the cure

29:23.824 --> 29:27.175
or about Jeremy, then
maybe you can come help.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.068
Ok.

29:39.622 --> 29:41.239
That is an interesting predicament

29:41.241 --> 29:42.841
for both of us.

29:45.511 --> 29:48.913
Did you miss the part
where I said I'm compelled?

29:48.915 --> 29:50.882
Don't stop!

29:52.718 --> 29:53.968
Seriously?

29:53.970 --> 29:55.470
You're being hunted by a vampire,

29:55.472 --> 29:57.255
and now you're bleeding?

30:06.782 --> 30:08.983
Aah!

30:08.985 --> 30:11.069
Dumb move, Jer.

30:11.071 --> 30:12.904
You can't fight me in closed quarters.

30:12.906 --> 30:14.105
It was worth a shot.

30:14.107 --> 30:15.824
Aah!

30:15.826 --> 30:17.792
Ugh.

30:17.794 --> 30:21.880
You're gonna have to shoot
me, Jeremy, in the heart.

30:21.882 --> 30:24.132
I'm not gonna be able to stop myself.

30:24.134 --> 30:27.285
Jeremy, you are a hunter.

30:27.287 --> 30:29.471
You know what to do.

30:29.473 --> 30:31.556
Do it.

30:31.558 --> 30:32.957
Do it!

30:44.238 --> 30:46.188
Ow.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.707
Ugh.

30:59.636 --> 31:03.372
He shot me in the head.

31:03.374 --> 31:06.642
Stupid idiot...

31:06.644 --> 31:09.829
Borderline brain-dead moron!

31:15.969 --> 31:18.721
That was dumb, Jeremy.

31:18.723 --> 31:21.657
Eh.

31:21.659 --> 31:24.026
Should have killed me
when you had the chance.

31:33.420 --> 31:34.787
Going somewhere?

31:34.789 --> 31:36.172
I would if I were you.

31:36.174 --> 31:37.406
If Damon kills the hunter,

31:37.408 --> 31:38.608
Nik will not be pleased.

31:38.610 --> 31:41.010
I told Nik I wouldn't touch the kid.

31:41.012 --> 31:42.128
I didn't.

31:42.130 --> 31:43.262
Oh. Well,
that was clever.

31:43.264 --> 31:45.548
I'm sure he'll really appreciate it.

31:50.437 --> 31:51.971
You'd really dagger me?

31:51.973 --> 31:56.309
If I do, Damon's compulsion
ends and this is all over.

31:56.311 --> 31:58.060
And then you're no better than Niklaus.

31:58.062 --> 32:00.529
Daggering siblings when
you disagree with them...

32:00.531 --> 32:02.565
look at what this family has become.

32:02.567 --> 32:04.900
I mean, Elijah won't even show his face

32:04.902 --> 32:07.386
he's so disgusted by our bickering.

32:09.573 --> 32:11.741
This cure has ruined us,

32:11.743 --> 32:15.110
and it hasn't even been found yet.

32:15.112 --> 32:18.047
Just imagine what would
happen if it is.

32:18.049 --> 32:22.251
This family was ruined long
before we knew about the cure.

32:24.254 --> 32:25.454
Kol!

32:25.456 --> 32:27.473
I won't let you raise Silas.

32:28.842 --> 32:30.810
Enough of this foolishness.

32:30.812 --> 32:32.311
Put it down, Kol.

32:36.233 --> 32:37.633
He was going to kill me.

32:38.935 --> 32:41.570
Well, then, I think you need a lesson

32:41.572 --> 32:44.106
in how to properly dagger a sibling.

32:47.477 --> 32:49.362
Burn in hell.

32:58.755 --> 33:00.256
Unh!

33:11.935 --> 33:13.836
Damon, stop!

33:16.023 --> 33:19.842
I know that you don't
want to hurt Jeremy,

33:19.844 --> 33:24.363
so please stop.

33:24.365 --> 33:25.815
I can't.

33:25.817 --> 33:27.316
Yes, you can.

33:27.318 --> 33:29.017
You're strong enough
to resist the compulsion.

33:29.019 --> 33:31.070
I know that you are.

33:31.072 --> 33:32.655
Why, because Stefan did?

33:32.657 --> 33:36.709
Because I love you,
because you love me.

33:39.713 --> 33:43.916
You'd do anything for me, so please...

33:43.918 --> 33:45.968
Do this for me.

34:00.317 --> 34:02.351
I'm sorry, Elena.

34:02.353 --> 34:03.819
Damon!

34:06.490 --> 34:07.773
Jeremy.

34:10.025 --> 34:11.444
Shoot now.

34:13.947 --> 34:16.449
Hey, brother.
Long time, no see.

34:25.292 --> 34:26.458
You're welcome.

34:43.221 --> 34:46.356
Easy there, buddy.

34:46.358 --> 34:48.525
You lost a lot of blood.

34:51.846 --> 34:54.681
So you bled me out?

34:54.683 --> 34:56.815
Yeah. I didn't really
have much of a choice.

34:56.818 --> 34:58.618
Kol's compulsion is still in effect,

34:58.620 --> 35:00.620
so you need to stay locked up.

35:00.622 --> 35:03.523
We don't have any vervain, so...

35:03.525 --> 35:05.825
This was the only way
I could weaken you.

35:05.827 --> 35:09.663
You sound real torn up about it.

35:09.665 --> 35:12.582
Shouldn't we be going after Kol,

35:12.584 --> 35:14.868
make him decompel me.

35:14.870 --> 35:17.070
Yeah, yeah, sure. That
sounds easy enough, Damon.

35:17.072 --> 35:18.538
I'll get right on that.

35:23.395 --> 35:24.844
At least let me see Elena.

35:24.846 --> 35:27.263
Come on. You know
you can't do that.

35:27.265 --> 35:28.765
With the sire bond, all you have to do

35:28.767 --> 35:30.350
is tell her to let you out of here.

35:30.352 --> 35:33.019
It's too risky.

35:33.021 --> 35:34.988
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you?

35:34.990 --> 35:36.906
It's better for Elena if
you stay in here for now,

35:36.908 --> 35:38.558
at least until we find the cure,

35:38.560 --> 35:40.493
and then once she's no longer sired

35:40.495 --> 35:43.580
and you're no longer compelled,

35:43.582 --> 35:46.533
you can both do whatever
the hell you want.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.952
Stefan, wait. Stefan!

35:54.376 --> 35:55.742
Stef...

36:08.105 --> 36:09.922
Going to see Damon?

36:09.924 --> 36:11.524
I need to talk to him.

36:11.526 --> 36:13.827
Well, you can't. He'll just
ask you to let him out.

36:13.829 --> 36:15.061
I won't let him out.

36:15.063 --> 36:17.030
You won't have a choice.

36:17.032 --> 36:18.615
You're sired.

36:23.170 --> 36:24.738
That all?

36:24.740 --> 36:27.791
Stefan, what are you
doing with Rebekah?

36:27.793 --> 36:29.459
She tried to kill me.

36:29.461 --> 36:31.044
And this will be the second time that

36:31.046 --> 36:33.747
Damon tried to kill Jeremy.

36:33.749 --> 36:36.499
So I guess nobody's perfect, right?

36:39.086 --> 36:42.005
Are you trying to punish me?

36:42.007 --> 36:44.340
I don't know how many times
I can apologize.

36:44.342 --> 36:46.309
I never asked you to.

36:46.311 --> 36:47.460
You can do whatever you want, Elena.

36:47.462 --> 36:49.629
I really don't care.

36:54.318 --> 36:57.520
You're hurt.
You're hurt,

36:57.522 --> 36:59.939
and you're acting out, Stefan.

36:59.941 --> 37:00.990
This isn't you.

37:00.992 --> 37:02.242
Sure it is.

37:02.244 --> 37:07.030
You've just never seen me like this.

37:07.032 --> 37:08.581
You don't know what I look like

37:08.583 --> 37:11.000
when I'm not in love with you.

37:18.042 --> 37:20.343
I'll let Damon know you stopped by.

37:36.644 --> 37:39.679
I owe you an apology.

37:39.681 --> 37:41.231
You don't owe me anything.

37:41.233 --> 37:45.552
I'm not happy to be right.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.687
I'm gonna get you some help.

37:47.689 --> 37:50.690
Help? Dad, I'm ok.

37:50.692 --> 37:51.858
Are you kidding me?

37:51.860 --> 37:54.027
I got angry I admit,

37:54.029 --> 37:55.495
but I knew what I was doing.

37:55.497 --> 37:59.198
You lost control, and Shane said...

37:59.200 --> 38:03.553
didn't we just establish
that we couldn't trust him?

38:03.555 --> 38:04.921
He's trying to get under your skin.

38:04.923 --> 38:07.590
The only thing that got under
my skin is what I saw,

38:07.592 --> 38:11.261
which is my daughter
using dangerous magic!

38:11.263 --> 38:12.762
And the fact that you
don't think you need help

38:12.764 --> 38:14.931
means you need it even more.

38:29.730 --> 38:31.781
Good evening, Gilbert clan.

38:31.783 --> 38:32.999
What do you want, Klaus?

38:33.001 --> 38:35.251
I've come to fetch my hunter.

38:35.253 --> 38:36.603
Seeing as how my brother's
become a liability,

38:36.605 --> 38:39.789
Jeremy will be safer with me.

38:39.791 --> 38:41.174
I think I'll pass.

38:41.176 --> 38:43.076
I've killed enough
people for you today.

38:43.078 --> 38:46.396
You think you're
safer here? Hmm.

38:46.398 --> 38:47.997
Clearly you don't know Kol.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.382
He'll stop at nothing
to get what he wants,

38:49.384 --> 38:51.584
so strange as it may seem,
I'm your best bet.

38:51.586 --> 38:55.271
Sorry, but I think we'd
rather take our chances.

39:00.311 --> 39:02.729
Fine, but when Kol does come...

39:02.731 --> 39:04.898
and he will come...

39:04.900 --> 39:06.699
be sure to let me know,

39:06.701 --> 39:09.235
preferably before he burns
your nice little home

39:09.237 --> 39:10.954
to the ground.

39:12.573 --> 39:15.408
And as for you, hunter,

39:15.410 --> 39:17.243
there's no shortage of people to turn

39:17.245 --> 39:20.613
and loved ones to
threaten, so sleep well.

39:20.615 --> 39:23.283
We'll plan on finishing
our work tomorrow.

39:39.684 --> 39:41.133
Sure. Just barge
right in.

39:41.135 --> 39:45.137
Oh. I thought not
knocking was our thing.

39:45.139 --> 39:46.823
You didn't dagger Kol.

39:46.825 --> 39:49.275
Well, the white oak stake
pointed at my heart

39:49.277 --> 39:51.244
made things a little difficult.

39:51.246 --> 39:55.281
I do believe my brother Kol
has finally lost his mind.

39:55.283 --> 39:57.333
That's all right.
Jeremy's still alive,

39:57.335 --> 40:00.987
and I took care of Damon.

40:00.989 --> 40:04.123
So where'd you put it?

40:04.125 --> 40:05.992
The headstone?
Mm-hmm.

40:05.994 --> 40:07.176
Some place safe.

40:07.178 --> 40:08.511
Wasn't really our deal.

40:08.513 --> 40:11.130
Well, considering that
you've betrayed me twice

40:11.132 --> 40:13.850
and I've betrayed you never,

40:13.852 --> 40:15.501
I think I'm acting brilliantly,

40:15.503 --> 40:18.972
especially since we have no idea
why that guy was looking for it.

40:20.941 --> 40:22.976
Did you work things out with Elena?

40:22.978 --> 40:24.343
Do you care?

40:24.345 --> 40:27.513
Nope. Just trying to figure
out why you're here.

40:27.515 --> 40:29.482
Do you even have to ask?

40:32.486 --> 40:36.873
No feelings, no attachments.

40:36.875 --> 40:39.492
None...

40:39.494 --> 40:41.210
Whatsoever.

40:52.923 --> 40:55.058
This is never gonna end.

40:55.060 --> 40:56.542
If Kol doesn't kill me first,

40:56.544 --> 40:59.796
then Klaus is just gonna force
me to kill more innocent people.

40:59.798 --> 41:03.232
How many is it gonna take, 10, 100?

41:07.488 --> 41:10.323
If you kill one original vampire,

41:10.325 --> 41:13.225
their entire sire line
will die with them.

41:13.227 --> 41:14.494
That's thousands,

41:14.496 --> 41:19.248
maybe tens of thousands of vampires.

41:19.250 --> 41:22.902
Kol compelled Damon to kill you.

41:22.904 --> 41:25.054
You're gonna kill Kol instead.

41:30.592 --> 41:36.159
