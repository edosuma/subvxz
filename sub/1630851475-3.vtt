WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:08.967
I see it!

00:09.050 --> 00:11.219
Lodged in the trachea,
just like we suspected.

00:11.302 --> 00:12.595
Applying countertraction

00:12.679 --> 00:14.806
to the surrounding tissue
to facilitate release.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.643
How does a fish bone
even get so stuck in there?

00:18.727 --> 00:22.022
Hmm. Patient recalled chugging
a bowl of fish head soup

00:22.105 --> 00:23.815
in a drunken state two nights ago.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.151
-Tourists.
-Tourists?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.737
Last week, you said "Manolo"
instead of "Mahalo".

00:30.321 --> 00:31.698
Successful removal, complete.

00:34.617 --> 00:35.785
There's bleeding at the wound.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.329
The bone must've initially
penetrated the vessel wall.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.372
He's desatting.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.082
Get the resuscitation team on standby.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.667
-Right away.
-I need ice-cold saline.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.752
Yes, doctor.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.558
-We have hemostasis.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.685
Great work, Dr. Kamealoha.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.187
That was a helluva fishing trip.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.906
-Mad props driving that scope today.
-Thanks.

01:12.989 --> 01:16.284
I worked hard for these swift fingers.
Took years of Insta scrolling.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.285
-Hmm.
-Hey, Doogie,

01:17.368 --> 01:19.746
I heard you killed it today
by not killing your patient.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.915
What? I was being sincere.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.376
Hey, anybody up for a little
post-op celebration?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.170
-Some fried mandu at TJ's?
-Sure.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.047
-That separate checks, right?
-Can we?

01:29.130 --> 01:33.384
We would love to,
but we have leftover meatloaf at home.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.096
All right. Next time, Doog.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.388
I drive alone.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.769
Let's go.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.444
Hey, um, can I borrow the car
when we get home

01:51.528 --> 01:53.446
so Steph and I can grab a quick Starbucks?

01:54.364 --> 01:56.950
-Maybe some other time.
-Come on, Mom.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.661
I just performed a very complicated
medical procedure.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.246
I think I can handle your Malibu.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.999
This is an Impala, by the way.
It's the Rolls Royce of Chevys.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.210
You know, when you were a resident

02:07.293 --> 02:10.255
and wanted to celebrate
after nailing a tough procedure,

02:10.338 --> 02:13.341
I'm pretty sure you didn't have to ask
your mom for permission.

02:13.424 --> 02:16.928
No, I didn't.
Because when I was a resident, I was 27.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.388
I was a grown woman.

02:18.888 --> 02:21.891
I had the Rachel haircut and a PalmPilot.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.187
Aren't both those things from the '90s?
You were 27 in 2005.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.148
I'm not an early adopter!

02:28.231 --> 02:31.568
And you don't need to be doing
so much math all the time.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.154
But the point is, when you're older,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.656
you'll be able to celebrate
as much as you want.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.616
But I'm a doctor now.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.661
And it's not fair
that I get all that pressure,

02:41.744 --> 02:42.704
but none of the fun.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.080
Life isn't fair.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.001
I once met Cyndi Lauper
and forgot my camera.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.669
What?

02:50.795 --> 02:52.797
Girls didn't have fun that night.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.876
-Hey, Dad, uh...
-We're not getting a pet stingray.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.170
I'm over that. Too much of a flex.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.464
I wanted to take <i>hula</i> lessons.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.465
Really?

03:37.508 --> 03:40.553
That makes me so happy!

03:40.637 --> 03:42.847
Wow, was not expecting this much energy.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.935
Sorry, guess I'm excited to hear
you're taking an interest

03:47.018 --> 03:48.144
in Hawaiian culture.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.522
Hey, did you know that <i>hula</i> was started

03:51.606 --> 03:54.609
as a way to pass down stories
from generation to generation?

03:54.692 --> 03:58.029
No. But I sense
you're gonna tell me all about it.

03:58.529 --> 04:02.200
King Kalākaua called "hula"
the language of the heart,

04:02.700 --> 04:04.619
the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.623
Which means every proud Hawaiian man
must learn to communicate

04:08.706 --> 04:11.960
not only with his mouth
but also with his hips.

04:13.002 --> 04:14.003
Like this.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.634
Don't be shy. <i>Kaholo</i> with me.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.430
You need someone to drive you
to those classes, don't you?

04:24.931 --> 04:28.184
<i>Kaholo. Kaholo. Kaholo.</i>

04:28.268 --> 04:31.646
<i>Kaholo. Kaholo. Kaholo.</i>

04:31.729 --> 04:36.693
<i>-Kaholo. Kaholo. Kaholo.</i>

04:36.776 --> 04:39.279
Hula-ing over
with grilled pineapple.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.614
This is exactly what my parents envisioned

04:41.698 --> 04:43.908
when I told them
I was marrying a Hawaiian.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.535
Grilled pineapple's not Hawaiian.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.538
-I used an Applebee copycat recipe.
-Ah.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.164
Hey, Dad, I don't know if you knew,

04:50.248 --> 04:52.417
but Mr. Kahala
is getting rid of his old Vespa.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.586
It doesn't run and we'd have to fix it up,
but he said that we could have it.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.256
-For free.
-Free junk removal.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.050
I've seen that thing, it's rust on wheels.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.885
Oh, come on, honey.
It's a vintage scooter.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.220
That rust is character.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.514
Yeah. Didn't you use to have one?

05:06.973 --> 05:11.978
Oh, a 1967 Vespa Sprint in Capri Blue.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.522
Swallowed my first wasp on that thing.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.274
Then I learned to ride with my mouth shut.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.402
Oh, I'd thought
it would be a cool father-son project.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.281
It would be nice to do something together.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.492
Yeah, like when we spent a week building
that volcano for my science class.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.828
We failed that project together, son.

05:32.957 --> 05:36.127
It's not fair. My mom won't let me
take the car to Starbucks.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.671
Damn. Your mom's out of control.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.008
All I want is to be out
on the open road with you.

05:42.091 --> 05:46.012
Wind in my hair and a Starbucks
Strawberry Açaí Refresher in my hand.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.472
That's the dream.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.474
Get a Strawb Açaí Refresher
and a cake pop,

05:49.557 --> 05:51.768
pick up some hot hitchhikers,
take them to make out point,

05:51.851 --> 05:52.894
and pray they're good guys.

05:54.896 --> 05:59.609
Rip Tide here,
reporting live with Tide in the Sky!

06:00.651 --> 06:03.029
Oh, my god, it's that crazy weather guy.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.031
There's been some budget cuts
at Channel Six.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.409
As you can see, I no longer have
my hair and make-up team,

06:08.493 --> 06:10.703
or my chopper, or even my van.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.206
But that's not gonna stop Rip Tide
from taking to the skies

06:13.289 --> 06:15.375
to deliver the mid-morning surf report!

06:15.458 --> 06:18.211
Borrowed the neighbor's
power company truck

06:18.795 --> 06:20.505
and looking out from way up here,

06:20.963 --> 06:24.717
I assure you, man, the waves are electric!

06:30.473 --> 06:31.891
I'm just kidding, dude!

06:31.974 --> 06:34.102
Whoa!

06:34.185 --> 06:35.561
-- Hey!
-- Don't move.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.524
Out of the way!
You two, keep everyone back!

06:39.607 --> 06:41.526
No. Hold on. Who are you?
We're lifeguards.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.902
Congratulations, I'm a doctor.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.405
Mr. Tide, can you hear me?
I'm here to help you.

06:48.825 --> 06:49.909
His heart's racing.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.830
I can't hear any breath sounds.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.375
Subcutaneous emphysema,
tracheal deviation...

06:57.458 --> 06:58.876
This looks like a tension pneumothorax.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.378
-We'll get him to the hospital.
-There's no time.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.587
His lung's collapsing.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.923
We're making the ER right here.
Don't let him move.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.633
I need to find a needle
to decompress his lung.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.802
Otherwise, this man's
going into cardiac arrest.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.221
That'll have to do.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.600
I'm sorry, I need to borrow this.
I'm a doctor, I swear.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.893
It looks better down anyway.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.062
Bongos, you got a lighter?

07:21.357 --> 07:22.650
Sorry.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.534
Whoa. You're gonna stab him?

07:31.617 --> 07:32.618
I'm gonna save his life.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.711
He's breathing, you saved him.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.006
Let the paramedics know
he's gonna need a chest tube stat.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.722
Who is that girl?

07:52.805 --> 07:56.976
She's Doogie Kamealoha, hot MD.
And I'm her best friend.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.023
Yeaow.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.949
Ah, looks like your class is all girls.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.785
So which one did you sign up for?

08:15.828 --> 08:19.248
Mele. She's in my gym class.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.543
Climbs the rope without the beads,
four-minute wall sit.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.421
She's a straight-up Earth angel.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.133
Well, if I were you,
the way I'd approach it is...

08:32.136 --> 08:34.931
You're right. You got this.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.850
Hey, Brian Patrick.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.728
Nice shirt.
Orange is my favorite color. And flavor.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.272
Oh, I know, girl. I do my research.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.484
Dude, your rescue at the beach
totally went viral.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.694
They made a remix song of you
stabbing Rip Tide's chest!

08:48.778 --> 08:50.029
<i>I'm gonna save his life.</i>

08:50.112 --> 08:52.615
<i>He's breathing, you saved him!</i>

08:56.536 --> 08:57.662
I know that song.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.956
My dad listens to it in the garage
when he gets sad.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.292
You gotta milk this.
You gotta hot froth milk this.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.377
You're, like, famous now.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.504
There's no way your parents
aren't gonna give you the keys to the car.

09:06.587 --> 09:09.799
-They let Justin Bieber buy a house.
-And Bieber saved no lives.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.926
-You deserve those keys.
-I deserve those keys!

09:12.009 --> 09:13.010
I'm going in!

09:13.511 --> 09:15.763
I mean, you are.
You're going in, you live here.

09:16.764 --> 09:18.599
And your mom's still salty
I ate all her hummus.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.897
<i>...at which point he fell from
a Honolulu Power and Light cherry picker.</i>

09:24.981 --> 09:27.191
<i>But luckily, local teen prodigy
Dr. Lahela Kamealoha...</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:30.403
-Yes!
-Oh, it's on the news now?

09:30.486 --> 09:31.988
-Lahela.
-The internet, the news.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.448
Everywhere I look,
I'm saving this man's life.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.742
-Great job.
-Yeah, honey. Way to go.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.495
You know where I would love to go?

09:39.870 --> 09:44.166
Starbucks with Steph.
For a little post-life save celebration?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.545
That sounds fun, a little girl time.
Come on, I'll drive you.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.799
Actually, I was kind of picturing it
just me, Steph, and your car.

09:51.882 --> 09:56.220
-Hey, guys. I brought cookie cake.
-Whoa. Where'd that come from?

09:56.304 --> 09:58.556
I baked it during Home Ec
and totally aced my midterm.

09:58.639 --> 09:59.765
Teacher gave me a B-plus.

09:59.849 --> 10:00.725
-Yeah.
-You made this?

10:00.808 --> 10:02.768
-Ya.
-Good work, buddy.

10:02.852 --> 10:06.397
-So, can I please borrow the car?
-Brian Patrick, get some plates.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.357
I'm not sleeping on this cookie cake.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.943
-Mm-mm.
-Already on it.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.946
-Oh, yeah. Okay, great.
-Mm-mm!

10:14.030 --> 10:14.989
Yeah.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.911
-Mmm, How is it so good?
-I put jam in it.

10:20.995 --> 10:24.290
-Jam?
-Go off, king.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.834
Oh, by the way, I just saw Mr. Kahala

10:26.917 --> 10:29.420
and he said that if we want the scooter,
then we have to take it today.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.797
He needs the room in his garage,
so I said he could bring it by.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.841
You know,
so I could learn how to fix it up.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.593
That's cool, right?

10:35.676 --> 10:36.969
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Yeah, fine.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.890
What? Kai's getting the Vespa?

10:40.973 --> 10:43.476
No, he's simply keeping it
in the garage to work on it.

10:43.559 --> 10:47.396
What a day. My one son does the hula
and my other son makes a cookie cake.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.066
-No Phil Collins in the garage tonight.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.360
I saved a man's life!

10:52.443 --> 10:55.488
-MR.Kai!
-Oh, that must be Mr. Kahala. Let's go.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.246
<i>Aloha!</i> Fun time delivery for Kai.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.794
-Look at that thing.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.462
-Wow.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.300
So, Famous Amos remembers
to put chocolate chips in his homework

11:16.384 --> 11:17.510
and gets a Vespa.

11:17.593 --> 11:21.430
I bust my butt, save a man's life,
and you won't even let me take the car.

11:21.514 --> 11:26.394
Look, Lahela. 60 percent of teenage
accidents happen with a friend in the car.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.980
So, there's no way I'm letting you
get in the car with that hummus thief.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.739
-There you are. <i>Mahalo.</i>
-<i>Mahalo.</i>

11:40.491 --> 11:44.829
Your finest <i>lei,</i> please.
Full disclosure, I have no money.

11:45.538 --> 11:49.250
It's for Mele. We're doing a performance
and I wanna give her a special <i>lei.</i>

11:49.333 --> 11:50.584
Of course.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.880
Uh, let's go orange flowers.
That's her favorite color.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.007
You know,
I had a crush on a hula girl once.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.175
Back in high school.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.137
Things were great until
this giant fire-dancing dude showed up

12:01.220 --> 12:02.680
to perform at our class one day.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.557
The minute she saw Clint Ribeiro...

12:05.766 --> 12:06.851
it was over for me.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.519
Why?

12:08.602 --> 12:10.730
Girls can't resist
a buff dude throwing fire.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.442
Especially one that drives an El Camino.

12:14.525 --> 12:18.654
-Yeah, fire dancers are pretty cool.
-Yeah, they're cool.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.531
But how hard is it to steal a guy's girl

12:20.614 --> 12:22.491
when you're dancing
with fire in your hands?

12:22.575 --> 12:25.244
Try doing it with just your hips
and a grass skirt.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.204
Like a man.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.591
Lahela, look. I got it working.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.967
I can't believe you fixed it.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.510
I thought it was
pretty much beyond repair.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.722
Yeah, just changed the little cable
and then this pluggy thing and...

12:45.222 --> 12:48.517
-I'm like a doctor, but for scooters.
-Good job, Kai.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.561
Hey, why don't you take it
for a little spin around the block?

12:50.644 --> 12:51.687
-Yeah.
-You earned it.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.646
Tight!

12:53.355 --> 12:55.483
-Be safe!

12:55.566 --> 12:56.442
So zippy.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.028
Okay, earned it? How?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.739
If he gets to ride that thing,
I should get to borrow the car.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.240
And I should get something.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.368
I feel like we keep
coming back to stingray.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.372
You see, you just got your license.
You need more practice.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.542
I'm a doctor, I'm not some twerpy kid.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.253
I held a man's heart in my hand yesterday.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.757
Honey, you've been preparing for surgery
since you were eight.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.468
You've had your license for three weeks.

13:22.551 --> 13:26.222
Doctor skills don't magically
translate into other skills.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.599
Look at my eyeliner.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.894
Oh, and remember,
we're not gonna be home later.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.021
We have Brian Patrick's hula show.

13:34.688 --> 13:38.234
I bet this is how dads in Texas feel
before their sons' football games.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.401
Hmm.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.408
-Are you crazy?
-Close. I'm Rip Tide.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.995
All right, everyone out. Get out!

13:50.621 --> 13:54.083
-Charles, you? You're a doctor.
-Sorry, I just really admire him.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.043
I've always wanted to be
the bad boy, you know?

14:00.297 --> 14:01.549
<i>Manolo.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:05.010
-All right, let's get you down.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.721
You are in recovery, still.

14:07.805 --> 14:10.766
Your lung collapsed.
You barely survived that stunt.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.978
Stunt? That was journalism.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.940
And I've barely survived lots of things.
It's the only way to live.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.610
Oh, come on, you're a teenager,
you must do wild things all the time.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.989
I wish. My parents are total fun killers.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.200
They won't even let me borrow the car
to drive to Starbucks with my best friend.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.244
They're making you wait
till you get your license?

14:30.327 --> 14:32.580
-That's so messed up.
-I have my license.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.541
You have your license?
Then what's stopping you?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.377
Little advice?

14:38.961 --> 14:40.629
You gotta make your own rules
in this world.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.132
Life's too short
to be asking for permission.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.093
Just do you and apologize later.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.512
Yeah, that's not really my thing.

14:48.596 --> 14:53.142
Oh, did you ask permission when you jabbed
that hairpin into my chest?

14:54.476 --> 14:57.062
You need to take risks. Have confidence.

14:57.646 --> 15:02.192
I do. When I'm being a doctor.
Other stuff's just different.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.070
No, it's not. This is life, baby.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.739
You gotta find your "Yeaow!"

15:08.991 --> 15:10.242
You're only a teenager once.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.371
You can't just sit around
and wait for lightning to strike you.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.166
Sometimes you gotta open an umbrella,

15:17.458 --> 15:20.336
slap a colander on your head,
and go get it.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.714
Get behind the wheel of your own life.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.553
-Freedom!
-We are golden goddesses!

15:29.637 --> 15:31.597
I love being bad! And safe.

15:36.810 --> 15:37.978
What was that?

15:38.187 --> 15:40.272
You popped a tire, slowpokes.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.152
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! No!

15:45.235 --> 15:46.654
My mom is gonna kill me.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.490
I never should've listened to a guy
with a massive concussion.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.493
It's fine. I'll just go down to the beach
and try to find some help.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.663
If I don't make it back,
tell your brother I love him.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.082
-Your older brother.
-Just go!

16:00.084 --> 16:01.502
I know what brother.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.470
-Wish me luck, I hope she likes it.
-She's gonna love it.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.013
Tell her your dad made it.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.099
It's definitely not what you should say.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.648
Hi, Mele, excited for the show?

16:22.731 --> 16:24.733
Yeah! But more excited to see you.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.903
So, I got you a little something.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.660
-Wait.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.704
What?

16:37.788 --> 16:40.791
I know that smell. Kerosene.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.837
-Coconut oil.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.216
The heck did this fool come from?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.302
Oh, no.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.513
Not again.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.434
Mele?

16:59.059 --> 17:00.185
Mele?

17:06.066 --> 17:07.192
I got you this <i>lei.</i>

17:16.160 --> 17:20.080
Oh, what a cutie! I love a fire dancer.

17:20.622 --> 17:23.417
That guy sucks. They're all chumps.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.102
-Whoa. Did you steal Mom's Malibu?
-Impala.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.022
And then I got a flat tire
and I'm stranded.

17:45.105 --> 17:48.484
So, go ahead, make fun of me all you want.

17:49.151 --> 17:52.029
Why would I make fun of you?
This is impressive.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.407
-Really?
-Yeah. You need help?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.743
No, not from you.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.370
Okay. Why are you so mad at me?

18:00.454 --> 18:03.540
Because I work so hard and get nothing,

18:03.624 --> 18:05.626
and Mom and Dad just give you everything.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.920
Yeah, you work hard, but I work smart.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.048
Actually, you work dumb.

18:11.131 --> 18:12.049
Excuse me?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.635
Okay. You know how I got this?

18:15.302 --> 18:19.473
I started small.
A chill mention about Mr. Kahala.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.309
Next, I brought home a cookie cake.

18:22.392 --> 18:25.646
Why? Because Mom and Dad
have a major sweet tooth.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.148
The perfect in to tell them
that Mr. Kahala said

18:28.232 --> 18:29.608
it was now or never with the Vespa.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.694
Mom and Dad
were so crunked on cookie cake,

18:32.778 --> 18:34.655
that they gave in without a fight.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.284
And that, my dude,
is how you get things out of our parents.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.748
-By plying them with sugar?
-By greasing the wheels.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.459
You know, Mr. Kahala never said
that he needed room in his garage.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.752
I made that part up.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.463
You lied?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.299
Hmm.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.635
I underestimated you.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.097
You're, like, a mastermind
at being a teenager.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.517
-And you could be one, too.
-Oh, yeah, right.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.935
I'm gonna be grounded for life

19:05.018 --> 19:07.020
when I have to tell Mom and Dad
that I took the car.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.022
Oh, my god, why would you tell them?

19:09.606 --> 19:11.316
Okay, I'm gonna full-on school you.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.442
I'm gonna change this tire,

19:12.526 --> 19:15.070
and we're gonna get back
before they get home from the hula thing.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.115
-So, lie to them?
-It's not lying.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.244
Ugh. My little doctor sister
has so much to learn.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.121
Come on.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.881
Sorry, man.
There was nothing you could do.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.550
He beat you with the ultimate orange.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.510
-Fire.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.555
It's okay. I may have signed up for Mele,

19:41.638 --> 19:44.349
but now I also like Luna,
Alison, and Anani.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.774
That's Luna. She likes blue,
so I'm thinking about dyeing my hair.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.619
Oh, hi.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.621
-Hi. Mm-hmm.
-You're Brian Patrick's mom?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.372
And Lahela's? The child prodigy?

20:07.456 --> 20:09.374
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, yeah, we saw her rescue on the news.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.627
Yes, I'm Clara. It's nice to meet you.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.253
We're such big fans of Lahela.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.589
I mean, the way that she saved
that weatherman's life.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.924
Such a hero.

20:17.007 --> 20:19.426
Thank you. She is pretty amazing.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.470
The way she just jumped in
to help, I mean...

20:21.553 --> 20:23.847
I'm sure your kid
would've done the same thing.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.433
My 16-year-old has a booger wall.

20:26.975 --> 20:27.893
Hmm.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.853
Your daughter is
responsible, accomplished,

20:29.937 --> 20:31.438
and already giving back to the world.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.273
You won the lottery of kids.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.525
Oh, trust me, when it comes to Lahela,

20:35.609 --> 20:38.070
I know I won the kid lottery.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.531
But maybe I should let her know that.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.660
Come on, hurry.
Mom and Dad are gonna be home soon.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.412
Okay, I'm trying.
These lug nuts are so small.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.414
-Pass me the other wrench.
-I got it.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.917
If I can drive a bronchoscope
down a trachea,

20:52.000 --> 20:53.669
I'm pretty sure I can handle a lug nut.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.089
Kai, I survived!
You won't have to marry anybody else.

20:57.172 --> 21:00.384
Not now, Steph. We have to hustle.
My parents are gonna be home any minute.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.803
-Wait, aren't they at the hula show?
-What are you implying?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.605
Whoo!

21:15.023 --> 21:17.109
That we have a little bit of time,
but not much.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.193
-Okay.
-Come on.

21:24.491 --> 21:25.867
Okay, there we go. I got it!

21:25.951 --> 21:27.619
-Okay, let's go! Let's go!
-Let's go!

21:27.703 --> 21:28.996
-Come on, come on!
-Get in the car! See you at home!

21:29.079 --> 21:29.913
All right.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.623
-Get in, get in, get in!
-Yeah!

21:38.380 --> 21:41.633
-We did it! We did it! We did it!

21:54.021 --> 21:55.480
Just, just a little faster.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.275
I am obeying the rules of the road, okay?

21:58.567 --> 22:00.193
A good driver is a safe driver.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.820
Five miles an hour?

22:01.903 --> 22:03.405
-Six!

22:34.728 --> 22:36.021
-Go!
-Okay.

22:37.647 --> 22:40.400
I mean,
it's really all about timing, isn't it?

22:40.484 --> 22:44.404
I mean, you just have to have
really good rhythm, you know?

22:44.488 --> 22:47.282
With all of those drums? You were amazing.

22:48.408 --> 22:51.453
-Hey, guys. Welcome home.
-How was the hula show?

22:51.536 --> 22:53.413
Good. What you guys been up to?

22:53.497 --> 22:54.664
Nothing.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.209
Just... watching this...

22:57.292 --> 22:58.585
nature documentary.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.503
Together?

23:01.129 --> 23:03.423
NARRATOR
<i>The blue-tongued lizard can lie in wait,</i>

23:03.507 --> 23:07.469
<i>motionless, for hours waiting
for its prey. Let's watch.</i>

23:09.304 --> 23:10.555
That's nice.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.101
NARRATOR <i>At last,
the unsuspecting cricket wanders</i>

23:14.184 --> 23:18.688
<i>-a bit too close and lunch is served.</i>

23:18.772 --> 23:21.191
-We pulled it off.
-I told you we would.

23:22.609 --> 23:23.819
Are you making popcorn?

23:23.902 --> 23:25.904
This documentary
actually looks pretty good.

23:25.987 --> 23:29.241
I'm on to my next scam. Later, loser.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.368
Hey, Kai.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.745
Thanks.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.497
No problem.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.542
Wait, what's the scam?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.588
I am gonna butter Mom and Dad up
for some gas money with...

23:44.172 --> 23:46.508
some hand-sized cookie cakes.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.218
You mean cookies?

23:49.177 --> 23:51.638
Uh, you just... You don't get it.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.598
Stick to medicine.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.311
-Another great surgery, Lahela.
-Girl, you did that man a favor.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.772
He got his gall bladder out
and a better-looking belly button.

24:00.856 --> 24:04.484
-Made that out of your ninny.
-Excellent handling of the laparoscope.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.487
-I'm very proud of you, Lahela.
-Should we celebrate at TJ's?

24:07.571 --> 24:10.407
Dr. Lee, did I hear you say
something about you're buying this time?

24:10.490 --> 24:12.242
Yeah, right. You know what,

24:12.325 --> 24:15.871
-I'll buy some fries for the table.
-Woah! Don't break the bank now!

24:16.121 --> 24:17.372
Have fun, guys.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.712
Hey, how about we go to TJ's?

24:24.296 --> 24:27.174
And then after,
you can drop me off at home

24:27.257 --> 24:28.842
and take Steph to Starbucks.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.137
Wait, are you serious?

24:32.220 --> 24:33.680
As long as you get me a venti

24:33.763 --> 24:36.308
Very Berry Hibiscus Refresher
with six sugars.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.727
-You know I have that sweet tooth.
-Sure!

24:40.270 --> 24:43.440
And for the record, I'm not always
running around saying you can't drive

24:43.523 --> 24:46.151
because I don't think you can do it.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.905
You are the most capable
16-year-old in the world.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.408
I know I won the kid lottery.

24:54.576 --> 24:55.494
Thanks, Mom.

24:56.703 --> 25:00.790
Honestly, the reason I'm so hesitant
about you driving is because I...

25:01.750 --> 25:03.126
I'm not ready.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.547
You're already so grown up.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.884
I worry the minute
you start driving yourself,

25:10.967 --> 25:13.720
you're gonna get in the car
and never come back.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.349
Mom, I will always come back.

25:18.975 --> 25:22.771
You better,
because you're my only baby girl.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.320
Besides, we live on an island.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.405
So, even if I did just take off,

25:32.489 --> 25:34.783
it's only about an hour and ten tops
around the whole thing.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.869
-Plus, I don't know how to do gas yet.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.877
-Does my one tire look different to you?
-I...

25:46.795 --> 25:51.633
Mom, they have these
new donut cake pops at Starbucks.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.760
Oh, really?

25:53.843 --> 25:59.599
Yeah, it's a mini donut-shaped cake
dipped in frosting with sprinkles.

25:59.683 --> 26:00.642
Ooh.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.520
Steph goes way too hard with them.
It's a problem.

26:03.603 --> 26:07.482
-I'll bring you back one.
-Oh, that sounds good. Yeah.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.910
People have called me
a child prodigy my whole life.

26:18.994 --> 26:23.081
And sure, being a 16-year-old doctor
is pretty exceptional.

26:23.164 --> 26:24.874
But my big brother,

26:24.958 --> 26:29.212
the first-born with the great hair
who mostly skateboards through life,

26:29.921 --> 26:31.965
he's exceptional at being a teenager.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.676
Guess our family has two prodigies.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.722
No wonder it's so hard for my mom
to let go of us.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.932
We're both pretty awesome.
