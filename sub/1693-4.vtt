01:51.069 --> 01:53.279
Come on, you gotta help me move these barrels.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.364
- Here we go.
- You can barely move in here.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.784
You've got your friends at the Coast Guard to thank for that.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.704
Three ships' worth of booze. The Nina, the Pinta and the Canadian Club.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.290
Bill McCoy's probably still crying his eyes out.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.000
On Nucky Thompson's shoulder.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.919
What happened with you and Nucky anyway?

02:09.003 --> 02:12.215
I guess that's between me and Nucky, isn't it?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.884
We need more space, Mickey.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.053
Ain't an empty garage in 10 miles.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.013
Then try 11. Pay cash.

02:19.932 --> 02:23.851
End of next summer, we'll be the biggest distributors in the northeast.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.895
From the tiny acorn

02:25.979 --> 02:27.730
grows the mighty elk.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.401
If you had a brain,

02:33.612 --> 02:35.404
you'd be dangerous.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.911
Yo, be careful with that.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.273
Don't like not knowing what's going on.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.941
That's what makes it exciting.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.119
What the hell is that?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.371
The Pipes of Pan.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.164
Goddamn cat in a rain barrel.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.709
Open your eyes,

03:30.669 --> 03:32.295
if thou darest.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.138
Ain't you the humdinger?

03:42.306 --> 03:43.723
Silence, mortal.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.058
I am Diana,

03:46.935 --> 03:48.686
daughter of Jupiter.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.148
And no man may look upon my nakedness

03:52.774 --> 03:54.191
as I bathe.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.694
This is one of your little performances.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.156
You should have come, dear, at least once.

04:03.327 --> 04:07.914
I never liked the idea of you parading around in front of other men.

04:08.665 --> 04:09.999
You could have married me.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.752
I had a city to run.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.378
I understand.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.007
I always have.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.720
But I did have a boy to raise.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.264
We're all here now, aren't we?

04:25.349 --> 04:27.350
He has so much to learn from you.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.646
I can't tell you what it means to us,

04:31.730 --> 04:33.356
after all this time.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.028
And you're going to take care of him,

04:40.113 --> 04:41.113
aren't you?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.449
Come here with that mouth.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.577
Do you know what happened to the shepherd

04:46.662 --> 04:48.913
who spied on the virginal Diana?

04:49.873 --> 04:51.999
She turned him into a stag.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.712
He tried to run away, but his own hounds

04:57.297 --> 04:59.256
tore him

04:59.341 --> 05:01.300
to pieces.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.928
Get your ass over here.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.904
Prepare for the righteous punishment

05:22.406 --> 05:24.115
of the gods.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.372
Louis?

05:35.794 --> 05:36.919
Louis!

05:37.212 --> 05:39.338
Louis!

05:40.298 --> 05:41.298
Louis!

05:43.552 --> 05:47.054
What does the bee do? Bring home honey.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.517
What does Father do? Bring home money.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.395
What does Mother do?

05:54.479 --> 05:56.022
Lay out the money.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.900
What do children do? Eat up the honey!

06:00.444 --> 06:01.944
Lovely, dear.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.613
- Very nice.
- Good morning.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.535
- Munchkins.
- Good morning, Uncle Nucky.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.953
Could you not sleep?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.371
I have a busy day.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.498
Will you be breakfasting, Mr. Thompson?

06:14.583 --> 06:17.251
I will not. Nor will I be dinnering.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.421
It's Ed Bader's birthday.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.672
Did I not mention that?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.009
I take it there will be a party?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.094
Something small, make him feel important.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.263
A meal in his honor, maybe.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.600
Be sure not to overindulge.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.143
Mr. Sleater.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.188
Good day, everyone.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.648
Top of the mornin'.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.276
Isn't that what your people say?

06:42.360 --> 06:45.237
And we also fix shoes if you leave them outside your door.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.451
- Surely it isn't that funny.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.162
Mr. Sleater will be driving me now.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.539
It's all I can do to stick to the correct side of the road.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.126
- I'll be right out.
- Sir, ma'am.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.253
Katy.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.009
Please ask Lilian to get the children dressed

07:07.344 --> 07:09.762
and to drill Teddy in his catechism.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.263
Come, dears.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.022
A bit cheeky, isn't he?

07:20.524 --> 07:23.150
- What's that mean again?
- Impertinent.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.152
He's serving a purpose.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.197
- And may I ask what that is?
- You may,

07:28.949 --> 07:29.949
and I may not answer.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.952
The weekly expenses.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.246
There's a little extra for the staff.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.207
- What for?
- To let them know they're appreciated.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.876
This is no time to be frivolous with money.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.212
It's two dollars extra apiece.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.382
It makes no difference to us, but to them it's a windfall.

07:47.092 --> 07:51.053
You do realize they steal from us. It's what servants do.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.221
It's what everyone does.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.431
And we pretend not to know and life goes on.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.144
No one gave me a bonus when I was in service.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.313
All the more reason to be generous now.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.942
I'm nearly out of shaving soap.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.492
Any more of them eggs?

08:13.577 --> 08:16.203
You've had nearly half a dozen already, Albert.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.831
Tell them chickens to work overtime.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.667
- Daddy!
- There's my sweet pea.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.671
- When did you get home?
- Last night,

08:25.755 --> 08:29.592
past your bedtime. Crept in like the sandman.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.428
Will you check my homework?

08:32.636 --> 08:34.013
You're asking Daddy?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.265
Your mama'll do that for you.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.268
Your brother know I'm too strict.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.352
If you say so.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.854
Stop toying with your father.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.356
He know who bring home the bacon.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.194
How my princess doin'?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.696
Did you ask him, Mother?

08:50.780 --> 08:52.156
Ask me what?

08:52.949 --> 08:54.783
Mama invited Samuel over for dinner tomorrow night.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.786
Did she now?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.163
We did discuss this.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.959
If a young lady is being courted, it needs to be in a respectable manner.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.253
He's planning to study medicine.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.421
Hmm.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.341
An educated buck.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.305
I suppose it'd be all right.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.266
Dinner with all the fixings.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.938
I been craving Hoppin' John since the moon was blue.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.838
- Richard.
- Good morning.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.424
I'm here for Jimmy.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.885
I thought he was with you.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.763
His mother called late last night.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.848
He left and I assumed...

10:01.559 --> 10:03.560
Was everything all right?

10:04.980 --> 10:07.147
He doesn't tell me anything.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.276
This business with Nucky...

10:11.403 --> 10:13.612
I saw him on the Boardwalk, he wouldn't even look at me.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.174
Very bold.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.554
My feeble attempt at expressionism.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.392
There was an artist I saw in Paris.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.894
He does cityscapes.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.148
Very stark, no people.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.233
De Chirico.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.986
I don't know.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.449
He also did figures who look like mannequins.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.081
Have you ever posed for an artist?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.419
Mmm. No.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.422
Sorry.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.967
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.263
I used to draw when I was a child.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.933
It was very relaxing.

11:27.562 --> 11:28.896
It can be.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.982
It can also be maddening.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.445
It took me years to be able to draw hands.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.999
It's apoplexy.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.252
A stroke. His entire right side is paralyzed.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.631
He can eat, but so far he's been unable to speak.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.926
Was he agitated? Overexcited in any way?

11:59.427 --> 12:01.470
As I said, I found him like this.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.721
Shouldn't he be in a hospital?

12:02.806 --> 12:03.889
No.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.352
No one can care for him like his family.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.732
Commodore.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.860
What do you want to say?

12:27.705 --> 12:28.705
Cock.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.046
Cock!

12:36.840 --> 12:38.298
Yeah, I...

12:44.806 --> 12:48.100
- Cock, fuck!
- That's enough for now.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.226
He needs to rest.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.438
Jesus Christ, he's a fucking vegetable!

12:52.522 --> 12:54.565
Keep your voice down, please.

12:54.649 --> 12:57.276
- What are we gonna do now?
- He's going to be fine, dear.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.445
- That's not what Dr. Surran says.
- Without him running this thing,

12:59.529 --> 13:02.865
- his political connections, Nucky'll...
- Stop it right now! The both of you!

13:02.949 --> 13:04.116
Now, you listen to me.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.743
I didn't spend my life getting groped by a bunch of drunks

13:06.828 --> 13:08.370
to wind up in a goddamn poorhouse.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.580
I've got eight kids, Gillian.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.248
Jimmy and I are well aware of that.

13:11.374 --> 13:14.126
"Jimmy and you." That's exactly... The two of you,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.295
and him?

13:16.379 --> 13:17.754
None of that's normal. It never was.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.549
It's normal to me and to my son

13:21.217 --> 13:22.384
and his father.

13:22.677 --> 13:26.263
And it suited you, didn't it? Up till this morning.

13:26.347 --> 13:30.642
Up till this morning, the man with the clout wasn't drooling into his pajamas.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.728
You have a cruel streak, Eli.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.771
That's never an attractive quality.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.941
- He can't even talk.
- Louis is unwell.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.818
He's going to recover.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.236
You need to calm down.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.821
It's all going to work out.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.657
- How the fuck would you know?
- Because Jimmy will handle it.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.744
We're in for 70 grand to his cronies.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.580
They'll get paid back when we unload the booze.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.082
- What are you waiting for?
- The town's flush, Eli.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.417
Then sell it out of town.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.294
New York, Philadelphia.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.339
You wanna give me names and addresses, or should I just go door to door?

14:01.424 --> 14:02.883
Why ask me?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.594
You both got it all worked out, right?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.187
Maybe this wasn't the best idea,

14:15.855 --> 14:18.106
letting Eli see him like that.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.783
I'm sorry if I seemed heated, baby.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.994
It's a difficult time for both of us.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.087
I want ice cream!

14:40.296 --> 14:44.007
Alcohol and cake. Call it for 9:00 so nobody's expecting a full dinner.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.468
Hors d'oeuvres only. Dancing girls?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.428
Wouldn't be much of a party otherwise, would it?

14:48.513 --> 14:52.015
- Fine, then, you handle that.
- How old is Mayor Bader?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.059
The fuck do I know? What's the difference?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.521
- The candles for the cake.
- Don't make a production out of it.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.023
He is the mayor of Atlantic City.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.317
And not the Prince of Wales.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.283
Tell them to send up some eggs Florentine.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.202
- And get me Arnold Rothstein on the phone.
- Ja.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.337
Arnold?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.381
A Nucky Thompson on the telephone.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.717
I'll take it in here, darling.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.845
How's our stomach?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.639
It's still a little tentative.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.141
So much apple bread.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.604
It has a binding effect.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.189
Is that the best thing right now?

15:41.691 --> 15:44.526
Sound elimination is the basis of good health.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.492
Mr. Thompson.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.370
Mr. Thompson, to what do I owe the pleasure?

15:55.622 --> 15:59.583
A change in my circumstances, as I'm sure you've already heard.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.836
And are we discussing a problem or a proposition?

16:03.504 --> 16:05.922
That depends which side of the phone you're on.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.758
I need a port to land some cargo.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.511
I was under the impression Atlantic City was aptly named.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.807
The Coast Guard's locked me down. I can't land a mackerel.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.102
I have an import operation in Montauk.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.897
- Long Island.
- Mmm-mmm.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.651
Too far. What about Philadelphia?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.235
We'd have to cut in Waxey Gordon.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.281
I'm listening.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.492
There's my 20%

16:33.576 --> 16:37.412
and I'll convince Waxey that 20% for him is a fair price also.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.586
- That's a pretty penny, Arnold.
- Of course,

16:45.088 --> 16:48.548
my cut includes men to oversee the operation.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.593
You remember Mr. Luciano.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.472
- I do.
- Then it's settled.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.434
Direct your ships to Philly and let me know the details.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.940
You've got a new port of call.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.652
I can already feel the brotherly love.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.782
I'd like to thank Mr. White for joining us here today.

17:14.951 --> 17:19.079
We know how busy he is and how hard he works for our community.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.789
Ain't no matter, Wilfred.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.582
Yes, sir.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.710
Now, this is an informal gathering

17:24.794 --> 17:28.255
so we will not adhere to strict parliamentary rule,

17:29.006 --> 17:31.717
but if you could just raise your hands...

17:34.595 --> 17:36.805
I give the floor to Mr. White.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.186
Now I know y'all got your beefs and various complaints.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.231
I hear an earful over the past weeks I've been in jail.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.361
But I'm back now, and everybody know my door always open.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.658
- Mr. White.
- Yeah?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.368
I don't mean to trouble you.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.371
You ain't never no trouble, Mrs. Mayhew.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.498
There's this couple next door to me.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.501
They are habituated to late-night rent parties.

18:07.837 --> 18:11.715
There's no end to rag music being played,

18:11.799 --> 18:15.302
and unseemly behavior on public view.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.972
You ain't gonna be bothered by none of that from now on.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.892
Bless you, Mr. White.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.274
Travis Elkins, sir.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.526
I remember you fine, Travis.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.156
Mr. White, I been six months in the kitchen there at the Ritz?

18:36.240 --> 18:39.910
Near 40 of us on second shift. 12 hours on our feet.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.286
Uh-huh.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.746
Wash our aprons,

18:42.997 --> 18:44.873
that come out your pay.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.501
Break a cup, that come out your pay.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.378
Give us the one meal, if you call it that,

18:50.880 --> 18:52.672
it come out your pay, too.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.051
What they serve us, Mr. White, ain't fit for a dog tied to a stake post,

18:56.135 --> 18:57.886
and we working men.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.264
- I'll look into that, Travis.
- Thank you, sir.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.185
It's true.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.609
Everybody, enjoy the refreshments.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.569
- Mr. White.
- And remember,

19:14.654 --> 19:17.239
- come July 4th, all y'all...
- What about my husband?

19:22.286 --> 19:24.663
- How's that?
- Those white men cut his throat

19:24.747 --> 19:27.249
while he loading your trucks with your illegal liquor...

19:27.333 --> 19:30.043
Sister, moderation in the Lord's house.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.003
What bein' done about that?

19:32.964 --> 19:34.965
You'll be looked after, I promise.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.717
You promise. You promise.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.512
- My son is dead.
- I buried the father of my three children.

19:40.763 --> 19:43.932
They bring my man home rolled up in a wash bucket.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.768
- Ladies, ladies.
- It's true.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.606
I said it'll be taken care of.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.692
When? How?

19:53.776 --> 19:55.110
Order, ladies, please.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.736
Ain't nobody put you in charge.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.990
You walk around, take a bite off everyone else's plate,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.034
don't give nothing back except a summer clambake

20:03.119 --> 20:04.619
and a Christmas turkey.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.626
Continental Tea Garden, $422.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.590
Morgan's Oyster House, $216.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.385
- Shall I tag them with currency straps?
- I'll do it.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.555
- I don't mind, sir, I have...
- Johnny-on-the-spot, are you?

20:23.639 --> 20:26.182
Have you finished the affidavits for tomorrow's search warrants?

20:26.267 --> 20:28.393
- I was in the process...
- Concern yourself with your own duties,

20:28.477 --> 20:29.811
Agent Clarkson.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.522
Yes, sir.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.169
I'll be in the W.C.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.092
- According to the New York Herald...
- Do not start with that.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.011
...half of all prohibition agents accept bribes...

21:03.095 --> 21:04.888
- I'm not interested in discussing... ...or engage

21:04.972 --> 21:07.766
in some other form of illegal activity.

21:10.353 --> 21:13.772
- Just because you saw in the paper...
- Come on, Stan.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.066
You don't notice anything strange about him?

21:16.150 --> 21:19.319
- Where do I start?
- I'm not talking personal habits.

21:21.072 --> 21:24.282
A few weeks back, I'm down on Pacific, coming from the podiatrist.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.702
I spot him driving with another fella in a derby.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.121
It was suspicious.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.832
He didn't see me, so I tailed him.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.961
I did some snooping.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.087
You tailed our boss?

21:37.171 --> 21:39.798
They went to a barn. Trucks were coming and going,

21:39.882 --> 21:44.219
the smell of alcohol was in the air. It was a bootlegging operation.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.721
- I'll tell the world.
- So he's sitting on it,

21:46.847 --> 21:48.598
waiting for the right time for us to make our move.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.600
It was over a month ago.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.783
Heads will roll, gentlemen.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.245
- "Van Asshole."
- Sir?

22:11.622 --> 22:15.125
Someone scribbled an obscenity on the water closet wall.

22:21.924 --> 22:24.759
Due to recent events, it has become necessary

22:24.844 --> 22:27.887
that we scale back in an effort to conserve financially.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.848
- Are we being sacked, ma'am?
- No.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.476
Though I'm considering suggesting a wage cut

22:33.561 --> 22:35.729
- across the board.
- If I may?

22:36.230 --> 22:38.440
My husband has been unable to find employment...

22:38.524 --> 22:41.651
- I support a crippled brother...
- I'm sure you all have hardships,

22:41.736 --> 22:44.320
which we've taken into consideration.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.700
You'll each find an extra $2 in your pay this week.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.539
This week only, ma'am?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.958
Yes. As a bonus.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.881
I believe it's customary to say, "Thank you."

23:03.090 --> 23:05.216
Yes, of course. Thank you.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.472
What is it, ladies?

23:10.931 --> 23:12.140
Speak your minds.

23:16.312 --> 23:19.814
Actually, ma'am, we were expecting a raise in pay.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.650
- Whatever for?
- Mr. Thompson,

23:23.402 --> 23:26.321
a few weeks back, he came in one night in...

23:26.405 --> 23:27.697
A rather jolly mood.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.492
He told us he was raising our salaries.

23:31.702 --> 23:33.119
Forgive me, ma'am,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.331
but he may have been drinking.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.337
Well...

23:43.631 --> 23:47.801
It's a special kind of fool who relies on the promise of a drunkard.

23:51.013 --> 23:53.431
Now, if there's nothing else?

23:53.516 --> 23:55.433
- No, ma'am. Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.227
To your tasks, then.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.823
You talked to him about the cash up front, right?

24:15.704 --> 24:17.455
Munya!

24:17.540 --> 24:19.207
We made it.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.750
Manny Horvitz,

24:20.835 --> 24:22.961
this is the fella I called you about. Jimmy Darmody.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.254
Mr. Horvitz.

24:25.214 --> 24:26.840
You're Darmody?

24:27.383 --> 24:28.550
He's just a baby.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.301
I thought you liked em' young, Manny.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.637
If we're talking veal, yes.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.347
But when it comes to business...

24:35.891 --> 24:37.559
It's nice to meet you.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.727
- You speak Yiddish?
- That's all I know.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.063
Still, you make an effort. I'm impressed.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.607
Already I feel this is going well.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.401
This man looks interesting.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.902
My associate, Mr. Harrow.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.612
What happened to you?

24:49.947 --> 24:52.115
I put my nose where it didn't belong.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.829
You're funny. He's a sweetheart,

24:57.913 --> 24:59.914
and Mickey is a gonif from way back.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.332
Chayem.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.084
Introduce yourself.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.922
- Herman Kaufman.
- All right, Herman.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.675
First in his class at Eastern State...

25:10.759 --> 25:14.137
...Penitentiary.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.432
I'm kidding. Herman only did county time.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.267
Can I get you fellas something to eat?

25:19.727 --> 25:21.769
- No, but thank you.
- Ah!

25:22.271 --> 25:25.982
You're gonna smell the cooking and you're gonna get hungry.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.277
Avram, fry this up with some onions.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.906
So what's your pleasure, Mr. Horvitz?

25:33.157 --> 25:35.200
Munya, or Manny.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.702
My pleasure? I got a daughter.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.913
She's an angel. And my wife?

25:40.456 --> 25:41.706
Ankles got thick,

25:41.957 --> 25:43.499
but I love her anyway.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.003
And Waxey Gordon is a cocksucking piece of shit.

25:47.421 --> 25:49.297
- Why is that?
- He's a greedy prick,

25:49.632 --> 25:52.133
with his hand in my ass pocket where my wallet should be.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.718
Fuckin' khazer.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.762
Eight years I work with the man.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.764
Promises made and now where am I?

25:58.140 --> 26:00.225
Talking to a baby in a butcher shop.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.853
I like you, boychik.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.647
Nice warm feeling.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.565
We hear you're flush with hooch.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.151
- You heard right.
- How'd you like to make some dough?

26:10.361 --> 26:12.278
We didn't come to Philly for the brisket.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.031
You got liquor.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.325
We got money.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.285
You see where I'm driving?

26:19.828 --> 26:21.037
I need cash up front.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.164
First consider I got restaurants,

26:23.499 --> 26:25.208
30, 40 speaks,

26:25.668 --> 26:28.169
about 10 blocks or so in Jew town...

26:28.254 --> 26:31.381
Weikel off Somerset. It's a nice opportunity.

26:31.465 --> 26:34.968
We do 100 cases a week, build our business from there.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.470
And stick it right up Waxey's tuchus.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.431
Still has to be in advance.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.309
Five grand, we can make delivery anytime.

26:43.394 --> 26:44.686
That's a lot of green.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.522
You could always say no.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.654
We got a deal. But just so we're clear,

26:54.989 --> 26:59.617
my icebox is filled with pieces of fellas who tried to fuck me over.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.328
I just got creamsicles in mine.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.252
Mr. Harrow will be in touch.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.171
Gentlemen.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.012
Mr. Dempsey, Mr. Dempsey. Mr. Dempsey!

27:20.889 --> 27:22.682
Champ! Hey, champ!

27:22.766 --> 27:24.642
Mr. Dempsey, please!

27:28.814 --> 27:30.648
- Come on, Jack. Gotta go.
- All right, all right.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.484
That's it, all right. Thank you, thank you.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.570
- It's worse than being in the ring.
- Yeah, I know.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.660
There we go. There we go. That's my lawyer over there.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.413
- In a while you'll see his briefs.
- He's got his hands full.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.060
Ow!

28:08.479 --> 28:11.105
That's it, girls. Bring him in.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.364
Ow! Ow!

28:46.308 --> 28:49.227
Oink, oink, oink, oink!

28:53.107 --> 28:55.108
- Happy birthday, Ed.
- Make a wish.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.360
This was my wish.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.243
I'm sorry. I didn't realize

29:05.327 --> 29:07.370
you were in the middle of a city council meeting.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.789
Jesus, is that who I think it is?

29:09.873 --> 29:11.999
Jesus wouldn't last a round.

29:13.127 --> 29:16.462
Jack Dempsey, say hello to our esteemed Mayor Edward Bader.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.672
Happy birthday, sir.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.425
I usually keep my trousers on for visiting dignitaries.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.970
Hell, most of the fellas I meet are in their boxing trunks anyhow.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.848
He could have used you a minute ago when they were beating the tar out of him.

29:28.183 --> 29:32.061
I wouldn't tangle with these girls. That's for sure.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.063
And if you would, you'd be doin' it in Jersey City.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.731
Come here to gloat, Mr. Hague?

29:36.150 --> 29:38.484
That, and for some cake.

29:38.819 --> 29:41.237
- How you feeling about Carpentier, champ?
- Are you kiddin'?

29:42.739 --> 29:44.365
I'm gonna knock his block off.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.242
In a brand new arena I built for the occasion.

29:46.869 --> 29:49.036
Jersey City in July, what's that like?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.371
Once you get past the smell...

29:50.831 --> 29:52.748
Can't say he's lying there.

29:52.833 --> 29:55.501
I tell you, sometimes I gotta hold my breath running past that sewage plant.

29:55.586 --> 29:58.212
So train here. Fresh sea air,

29:58.297 --> 29:59.755
early morning runs on the beach,

29:59.882 --> 30:02.133
not to mention our other natural resources.

30:02.259 --> 30:05.136
- Sorry, hon, but we ain't homegrown.
- Philadelphia imports.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.263
I was wondering why I hadn't seen you around.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.098
We been here since November, sweetie.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.101
These are the girls we had trucked in during the election.

30:12.186 --> 30:16.564
She was responsible for 1,000 Republican votes single-handed.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.774
Except it wasn't my hands I was usin'.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.028
Wait a minute.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.406
Did you say you girls are from Philadelphia?

30:25.782 --> 30:26.782
What of it?

30:27.784 --> 30:31.078
My friend, you need to have a chat with your lawyer.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.125
- Cake?
- Yeah, a slice.

30:36.210 --> 30:37.460
- Cake?
- Slice of cake?

30:40.881 --> 30:42.381
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

30:42.799 --> 30:45.510
I just figured a way to get your case dismissed.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.596
Moving whores across state lines?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.640
That's a federal charge.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.659
Bureau of Internal Revenue. Special Agent Van Alden speaking.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.285
Nelson, are you all right?

31:11.620 --> 31:14.163
Rose. Yes. I'm fine, dear. What's wrong?

31:14.289 --> 31:17.542
I called your boardinghouse five times last night.

31:17.626 --> 31:18.751
That seems excessive.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.087
They said you no longer lived there.

31:21.171 --> 31:24.215
What? That's ridiculous.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.509
Who did you speak with?

31:26.593 --> 31:29.512
A Greek gentleman. I didn't get his name.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.682
Well, that's preposterous. I'll get to the bottom of this immediately.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.600
I was very frightened, Nelson.

31:36.270 --> 31:37.937
I thought something happened.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.524
No, of course not. There's nothing for you to worry about.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.278
The mice in the attic?

31:46.572 --> 31:48.906
They've been very active lately.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.617
I'll set traps next time I'm home.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.412
- When will that be?
- Soon.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.913
We're very busy, dear.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.628
I'm lonely, Nelson.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.632
And I don't like the way you sound.

32:08.760 --> 32:12.847
There are some very important matters I need to attend to.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.975
Please try to get some rest.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.936
I will. Take care and God bless.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.861
We're making progress. It's slow but sure.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.905
Slow don't cut it with four of my boys in an unmarked grave.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.325
Their families will be compensated.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.660
This ain't about money, Nucky.

32:35.245 --> 32:37.413
It's about revenge

32:37.497 --> 32:39.790
on them ghost-ridin' motherfuckers.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.542
You need to sit tight with that.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.545
I been sittin' tight. My ass sore.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.548
Those silk cushions ought to help.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.676
- You keep makin' this about money.
- It's always about money.

32:51.053 --> 32:54.513
It took a lot of cash for my lawyer to get you out, Chalky.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.098
That fella you have is inept.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.643
Did I not say thank you?

32:58.894 --> 33:01.228
You can thank me by being a good boy.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.732
I gave you my word.

33:08.654 --> 33:12.198
Now save your strength and enjoy your family.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.950
How am I supposed to do that?

33:16.787 --> 33:20.998
I got four other families waitin' on me for justice.

33:21.917 --> 33:25.086
You're not the only one looking to settle scores.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.385
These are your sworn depositions

33:32.469 --> 33:36.013
stating that Enoch Thompson brought you to Atlantic City last November

33:36.098 --> 33:40.476
with the express purpose of performing sexual favors

33:40.560 --> 33:42.269
for certain gentlemen in order to

33:43.605 --> 33:45.398
influence their voting blocs.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.570
You fucked people to sway their votes.

33:52.197 --> 33:53.197
Sure we did.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.492
A couple factory owners, some union reps.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.746
Then this accurately reflects your understanding of events as they occurred?

34:03.709 --> 34:04.917
Sure, I suppose.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.004
And the charges keep piling up.

34:09.089 --> 34:11.799
It's not like he doesn't have it coming.

34:34.781 --> 34:35.989
He loves you.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.495
There's love,

34:43.081 --> 34:44.831
and then there's everything else.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.001
I'm sorry.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.627
Am I allowed to talk?

34:49.713 --> 34:51.505
It doesn't hinder me.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.103
Have you ever been in love?

35:11.902 --> 35:13.694
Not the way you mean.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.489
Someone you care about?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.699
I have a sister.

35:20.994 --> 35:22.203
A twin.

35:23.705 --> 35:25.247
Her name is Emma.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.500
Where does she live?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.627
Plover, Wisconsin.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.881
We grew up on the farm.

35:35.717 --> 35:38.677
There were no other children of our age.

35:39.763 --> 35:42.056
We spent every moment together.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.725
- Inseparable.
- Yeah.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.854
We milked cows,

35:49.439 --> 35:52.024
baled hay, fished.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.402
She taught me how to cook.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.031
That's sweet.

36:00.534 --> 36:01.951
Whatever love is,

36:03.078 --> 36:06.664
that's what I felt for Emma.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.084
Do you visit her often?

36:15.507 --> 36:17.591
When I came back

36:19.052 --> 36:20.511
from the war,

36:21.263 --> 36:24.515
she nursed me, and gave me morphine

36:25.225 --> 36:27.184
to keep the pain at bay.

36:29.437 --> 36:33.899
Despite my injuries, she treated me no different.

36:34.985 --> 36:39.280
I was her brother, the closest person in her life.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.448
But suddenly,

36:44.536 --> 36:47.121
I felt different toward her.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.668
I would stare at her

36:54.796 --> 36:56.422
and feel nothing.

36:59.467 --> 37:03.137
I lost whatever I thought love was.

37:07.642 --> 37:12.521
When my wounds healed, I moved to Chicago to get lost there.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.695
I haven't spoken to her since.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.048
It was a constable station in Tipperary.

38:22.592 --> 38:26.387
They pulled the bodies of 12 Black and Tans from the rubble.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.055
One had no head.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.224
For the cause?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.267
A message for the Crown.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.687
And after that,

38:35.730 --> 38:38.607
it was our mission to execute a bombing a week.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.819
Lorries, sentries, British quarters, post offices,

38:42.362 --> 38:43.904
even a rectory.

38:44.614 --> 38:45.948
The wire.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.620
- This is what you used?
- Uh-huh.

38:51.788 --> 38:52.788
Gelignite.

38:54.040 --> 38:58.544
Blasting gelatin used in quarries for mining.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.629
You see, it doesn't sweat.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.965
Like you are now.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.010
What does "sweat" mean?

39:06.094 --> 39:09.138
That it won't leak nitroglycerine like dynamite.

39:09.222 --> 39:12.057
It's more stable and easier to transport.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.059
Detonators.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.275
They won't bite.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.985
What is it?

39:23.069 --> 39:27.865
Blasting caps filled with mercury and chlorate of potash.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.380
Someone's goin' out of business.

39:43.465 --> 39:44.548
Mickey Doyle.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.429
Here you go.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.147
There's another 50 in the car. They're Ingersolls.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.940
I wish you would stop with this.

40:02.025 --> 40:05.819
You schlep around with a box of watches, what do we look like?

40:05.904 --> 40:07.821
Fellas who know what time it is.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.364
Might as well set up a pushcart.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.619
Arnold Rothstein's here.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.662
We're talking, Benny.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.790
Oh, so I should tell him go fuck a duck?

40:17.874 --> 40:19.208
Enough with the crazy shit already.

40:26.216 --> 40:28.926
- What the fuck?
- Bring him in before he breaks the house.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.472
Mr. Rothstein.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.224
Put the bag away.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.688
A.R.,

40:41.815 --> 40:43.148
did you come to sit in?

40:43.233 --> 40:44.399
You know you're always welcome.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.862
I'm afraid those sharpers out there would fleece me.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.923
Owing to his present difficulties, I've made a deal with Nucky Thompson.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.301
He'll be offloading his liquor shipments in Philadelphia.

41:11.636 --> 41:14.263
Waxey Gordon will ensure safe arrival.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.058
The route to Atlantic City will be my responsibility.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.060
And you'd like us to recruit the muscle?

41:20.186 --> 41:22.229
I would like you to be the muscle.

41:26.401 --> 41:27.609
A.R.,

41:28.862 --> 41:30.821
we got some business going on just now.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.406
I can see that.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.493
But Mr. Thompson is paying me a premium.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.079
Anybody could ride shotgun.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.582
Until you encounter Indians.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.543
We're honored by your trust, A.R.,

41:45.545 --> 41:48.172
and flattered that you would come below 14th Street

41:48.256 --> 41:51.216
to discuss it personally. Aren't we, Charlie?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.302
- Sure.
- As it happens,

41:53.386 --> 41:55.637
I was down here having dinner with Joe Masseria,

41:55.889 --> 41:58.056
who left me with the distinct impression

41:58.558 --> 42:00.517
he'd still like both of you dead.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.603
You broke bread with that prick?

42:02.687 --> 42:07.274
We were served a native dish of tripe, which I cannot abide.

42:08.484 --> 42:13.363
But I ate it anyway, to keep the peace.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.368
Some things, Charlie, you just have to swallow.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.182
Adeline, can you bring the biscuits, please?

42:40.266 --> 42:41.308
Coming.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.062
Everyone take your places, please.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.070
I want to welcome Samuel to our table.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.697
Thank you, Mrs. White and Mr. White.

42:55.990 --> 42:58.867
And ask that he lead us in the saying of grace.

42:58.952 --> 43:00.577
I'd be honored, ma'am.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.584
- Lord, we...
- Is that a duck?

43:09.254 --> 43:11.463
Yes, Albert. Of course it is.

43:12.924 --> 43:13.966
Please, Mr. Crawford.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.511
- Lord, we thank you...
- I thought I asked for Hoppin' John.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.180
There's duck,

43:21.057 --> 43:23.475
peas, carrots, fresh-baked biscuits.

43:23.685 --> 43:26.311
I made chocolate pudding for dessert.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.023
- We'd like to thank you for the gifts...
- I asked a question.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.025
Albert, please.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.154
She made that pudding all by herself.

43:36.239 --> 43:39.116
- That's very nice.
- Where the damn Hoppin' John?

43:39.200 --> 43:43.036
Albert, you know that's not proper food for a guest.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.497
Now, let's allow Samuel to finish.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.919
- Lord, we come...
- Maybe our guest would've liked some.

43:51.129 --> 43:54.131
I have always enjoyed that type of food, sir.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.300
What type of food?

44:00.722 --> 44:02.723
My grandma would make it.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.731
I say something funny, son?

44:12.692 --> 44:14.735
- Beg your pardon?
- You laughing.

44:15.236 --> 44:17.988
- What the joke?
- Hoppin' John, Albert.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.114
You're being ridiculous.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.909
I been eatin' rice and beans all my life.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.288
Tell me it ain't good enough.

44:28.541 --> 44:30.876
You'll have to forgive my husband's country ways.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.336
I completely understand, ma'am.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.256
This is my house!

44:36.632 --> 44:40.677
And my country ways put the food on this goddamn table!

44:40.762 --> 44:41.928
Albert!

44:42.847 --> 44:44.014
You're drunk.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.651
Sir,

44:57.236 --> 44:58.570
I apologize.

44:58.988 --> 45:02.157
- I'll leave...
- You stay right where you are, son.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.118
Right there.

45:06.788 --> 45:08.789
Inside the house.

45:12.752 --> 45:15.629
Pretty clear who the field nigger is.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.024
Almost finished.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.629
This is what I look like?

45:58.047 --> 45:59.131
Yes.

46:00.383 --> 46:03.009
Hmm. Is it expensive?

46:03.636 --> 46:05.220
The drawing?

46:05.304 --> 46:06.972
I can pay for it.

46:07.306 --> 46:08.682
No. No.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.772
It's yours, if you want it.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.027
Ange?

46:22.155 --> 46:23.488
Ange, you home?

46:23.573 --> 46:24.823
In here.

46:30.037 --> 46:31.413
What are you doing?

46:31.706 --> 46:33.039
I was sketching Richard.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.460
I'll put him to bed.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.467
Thank you.

46:53.895 --> 46:55.562
He's tuckered out.

46:56.022 --> 46:58.899
We rode the Ferris wheel after my mother's.

47:01.903 --> 47:07.115
Tomorrow we're gonna need to go to Philly for that delivery.

47:08.951 --> 47:10.076
Okay.

47:13.623 --> 47:14.998
Good night.

47:20.713 --> 47:22.214
He sat for you?

47:24.592 --> 47:26.468
Is that so surprising?

47:30.723 --> 47:32.182
I don't know.

47:34.352 --> 47:37.187
I'm never sure what's going on inside him.

47:43.319 --> 47:45.237
I gotta hand it to Icky. This was a great idea.

47:46.155 --> 47:48.281
The whole thing was a setup.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.826
I mean, Fleming helped, too, of course.

47:55.456 --> 47:57.457
It was a means to an end.

47:58.918 --> 48:00.794
Surely nothing to be proud of.

48:02.171 --> 48:04.172
It's not pride, it's happiness.

48:04.257 --> 48:06.091
I violated the Mann Act.

48:06.425 --> 48:10.971
It prohibits the interstate transportation of females for immoral purposes.

48:11.806 --> 48:13.098
It's a federal law,

48:13.182 --> 48:16.601
which means the entire election case can be rolled into a federal indictment.

48:16.686 --> 48:19.980
- So the attorney general can help?
- Exactly.

48:22.358 --> 48:25.402
This is how things work, Margaret. You know that.

48:30.116 --> 48:33.493
I had no relations with any of these women, if that's what you're worried about.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.371
I believe you.

48:43.045 --> 48:46.715
The tide's turning, I'll tell you that much. I'd love to see the look on the Commodore's...

48:46.799 --> 48:49.175
I need $100.

48:51.512 --> 48:53.513
Clothes for the children.

48:55.683 --> 48:56.975
Very well.

49:14.910 --> 49:15.952
Where are you going?

49:16.037 --> 49:17.412
Off to bed.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.123
I'll be up in a while.

49:25.046 --> 49:28.006
It's owned by a widow, but ran by a fella named Mickey Doyle.

49:28.090 --> 49:30.467
Van Alden arrested him last year for bootlegging.

49:30.551 --> 49:32.177
This is the place?

49:32.261 --> 49:33.803
This is it.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.890
It looks deserted.

49:37.266 --> 49:40.352
You don't smell that?

49:41.729 --> 49:43.355
There's a still in there.

49:43.439 --> 49:45.690
I don't see the point of this.

49:45.941 --> 49:47.692
We're prohis, Stan.

49:48.402 --> 49:50.612
We're going to make an arrest.

49:50.905 --> 49:54.866
But if it is what you think it is, Van Alden will have our heads.

49:56.661 --> 49:58.787
Then we'll arrest him, too.

50:01.332 --> 50:02.332
Go check around back.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.467
Oh, God.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.988
That's it, one last bite.

52:39.073 --> 52:42.575
Louis, dear. You need nourishment.

53:10.271 --> 53:12.438
Do you remember when we met?

53:14.316 --> 53:16.526
I'll never forget your smile.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.778
Jimmy sometimes,

53:19.572 --> 53:20.905
he has it.

53:22.950 --> 53:25.118
I look at him and I see you.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.673
That first night,

53:41.051 --> 53:43.720
how you plied me with wine.

53:47.600 --> 53:50.184
Why, I'd never felt such a sensation.

53:50.936 --> 53:52.645
We were downstairs.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.733
And I'd fallen asleep on the divan.

53:59.653 --> 54:02.322
You carried me to the bedroom,

54:03.115 --> 54:05.742
went to say good night to your guests.

54:08.370 --> 54:10.371
And I lay there in bed,

54:13.167 --> 54:15.043
dreaming of the waves.

54:17.713 --> 54:20.006
I'd been on the beach that day.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.680
Suddenly, I felt

54:28.933 --> 54:30.683
a crushing feeling,

54:31.852 --> 54:33.561
I couldn't breathe.

54:34.188 --> 54:39.067
I opened my eyes to find you atop me.

54:42.279 --> 54:46.199
Your breath smelling of whiskey and tobacco.

54:48.911 --> 54:52.205
One hand covering my mouth,

54:55.250 --> 54:57.377
and the other groping at me.

55:02.675 --> 55:04.467
Do you remember that?

55:17.731 --> 55:18.982
Still,

55:20.985 --> 55:24.028
sometimes when I sleep,

55:25.781 --> 55:27.156
it wakes me

55:28.492 --> 55:29.951
with a start.

55:34.623 --> 55:36.749
Do you remember that night?

55:37.376 --> 55:38.418
I...

55:46.593 --> 55:48.469
I asked you a question.

55:49.305 --> 55:55.209
