WEBVTT

00:21.080 --> 00:24.600
Pigsy, my love, you're so good to me.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.000
-Is he the real deal?
-[Pigsy] Looks like it.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.040
[Locke] Five hundred years,
stuck in a rock.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.200
[chuckles] I thought
it was a made up story.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.240
-Do you know who I am?
-Looks like you're dying to tell me.

00:36.320 --> 00:37.480
I'm the Monkey King.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.040
And I've been freed from my rock prison
by this little monk. And--

00:40.120 --> 00:42.440
Anyway! Hey, handsome.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.800
I have received a figure
in exchange for the captured gods.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.600
Tell your boss to double it,
and we'll talk.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.840
No. Here is half the payment.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.560
The rest on delivery.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.640
My men will be here at sunset
to make the exchange.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.800
[Locke] Boom!

01:07.880 --> 01:10.040
You filthy demonic slime ball!

01:10.120 --> 01:13.920
I will release on you
a tsunami of rage and fire so furious

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
that nothing but your stupid shoes
will be left smoking

01:17.080 --> 01:19.440
on a barren plain of your lost dreams.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.040
Ooh! Bold god! I like it.

01:23.680 --> 01:26.480
We have plans for you, O Monkey King.

01:26.560 --> 01:31.600
So sit back, relax, shut up,
and enjoy my hospitality.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.000
-[Locke laughing]
-[prisoners coughing]

01:40.280 --> 01:41.560
What about the monk?

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
Kill him.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.000
There's a stream over that ridge.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.000
Follow it,
and don't ever return to this town.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.600
Locke told you to kill me.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.560
Well, you just caught a break, so take it.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.960
I don't understand.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.280
Go, before I change my mind.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.240
What are you doing?

02:31.560 --> 02:32.800
I'm Tripitaka.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.320
That's nice. But at this point,
you should be running for your life.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.040
What's stopping you from killing me?

02:38.120 --> 02:40.200
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.600
-What's your real name?
-One...

02:41.680 --> 02:43.360
-I don't think you're a demon.
-Two...

02:43.440 --> 02:45.320
-And you're not a human.
-Three...

02:45.400 --> 02:46.320
So who are you?

02:49.240 --> 02:53.400
[grunts] Seriously, three.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.600
Don't let me see you again.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.040
[Monkey] Where's my staff?

03:19.120 --> 03:21.400
They took the weapons.
And they took Tripitaka.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.520
[sighs] You let them?

03:24.120 --> 03:25.360
We were asleep.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.320
You were having a nightmare.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.800
Very bad. Awful. Twitching, moaning.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.360
[panting] Why did they take the monk?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.280
I don't know. How would I know?

03:37.360 --> 03:38.840
[gasps] Is this a guessing game?

03:40.280 --> 03:41.280
Can I borrow that?

03:42.040 --> 03:45.560
Sure. You can keep it if you like.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.760
Symbol of friendship.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.320
Can you please stop talking?
I can't do things when you're talking.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.240
-It'll never work, you know?
-[grunts]

03:55.440 --> 03:56.920
-Sorry.
-[grunts]

03:58.920 --> 04:00.960
[huffing]

04:01.040 --> 04:03.400
-[Sandy] I wouldn't take it personally.
-[grunts]

04:03.480 --> 04:06.560
This prison was built to hold gods.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.800
Only a god can build a prison
strong enough to hold a god.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
Exactly.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.360
[Pigsy] Mmm.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Mmm. [sighs heavily]

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
Mmm.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.120
[Monica] You should feel
ashamed of yourself.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.600
[slurps] Thanks. I am, most days.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.600
How do you tuck yourself up
into bed each night

04:44.680 --> 04:46.920
and feel anything but deep self-hatred?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.720
Mmm.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.400
How do you wake up every morning
and not want to go to the beach,

04:52.480 --> 04:54.720
dig yourself a hole up to your chin,

04:54.800 --> 04:59.760
and wait for the tide to come in
and wash you clean?

05:00.600 --> 05:03.960
If it wasn't me, some other strong-arm
would step up and take my place.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.640
That was a monk.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.560
We all do what we have to do
to survive, Monica.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.000
Killing monks is a whole new level of low
for you, sunshine.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.360
I didn't kill the monk.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.080
I don't kill humans.

05:17.160 --> 05:21.200
So then... where...
Where is she? Um, he?

05:24.040 --> 05:26.920
[sighs heavily] Far from here, I hope.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.440
[indistinct chatter]

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
-[grunts]
-[lock clatters]

06:05.920 --> 06:07.720
-[Sandy] Monkey.
-Huh?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.960
Look. Over there.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.040
[grunts]

06:14.560 --> 06:16.920
-What are we looking at?
-Do you see a fissure?

06:18.680 --> 06:21.120
-A what?
-A crack in the wall.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.640
Here's what's going to happen.
Have you got a pencil?

06:25.200 --> 06:27.120
Sorry, of course. [clears throat]

06:28.960 --> 06:31.760
All right, behind Locke's palace
is a waterfall.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.480
That's how she controls
the town's water supply.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.520
Can you skip to the end?

06:35.400 --> 06:38.200
I was gifted with the elemental power
to control water.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.880
Now, we may not be able to
break out of here from the inside,

06:43.960 --> 06:47.680
but if I can direct
pressure of the waterfall

06:47.760 --> 06:51.160
through that fissure from the outside...

06:51.240 --> 06:54.640
And here I was thinking
you were dead weight. Let's do it.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.280
[exhales heavily]

07:12.240 --> 07:13.920
[grunting]

07:18.120 --> 07:19.520
[grunting]

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
[sniffles]

07:22.800 --> 07:24.040
You said waterfall.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.120
Oh, yeah, it smells more
like a sewage pipe, doesn't it?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.240
[grunts]

07:30.760 --> 07:32.760
[indistinct chatter]

08:21.000 --> 08:23.280
You have got to be kidding me.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.600
[exhales heavily]

08:29.480 --> 08:30.680
Damn!

08:39.880 --> 08:41.400
[men groaning]

08:44.159 --> 08:45.840
[panting]

08:48.720 --> 08:49.560
[gasps]

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
[sighs]

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Thank you.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.080
I should send you
flying over the town wall.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.600
You've caused me more trouble
than you know and half my lunch.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.920
I am sorry.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.000
You can't be seen here.
Do you understand that?

09:24.560 --> 09:27.040
Really? That's working for you?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.000
[Monkey grunting]

09:33.120 --> 09:35.160
There must be a way out of here.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.800
You really don't like being in here,
do you?

09:38.880 --> 09:42.240
[panting] I have been stuck in a rock
for 500 years.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.560
You can see how
this might be slightly depressing.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.320
I can. I can see that.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.880
I know. Let's play a game.

09:53.080 --> 09:55.440
Ask me anything. About me. Anything.

09:55.520 --> 09:56.520
[sighs]

09:58.200 --> 09:59.440
Why didn't you leave the town?

10:00.480 --> 10:03.880
You're a god. You could have left anytime.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.640
Okay. Didn't think it'd be
something quite so personal.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.680
You said "anything."

10:13.000 --> 10:16.160
I was born into a world
where there were no gods.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.840
All I could do was hide.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.640
I got used to hiding. I felt safe hiding.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.640
I did it so long,
I couldn't see any other way.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.080
My turn.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.320
Have you ever been in love?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.760
I don't wanna talk anymore about anything.

10:35.840 --> 10:36.880
That means "yes."

10:36.960 --> 10:39.360
No, it doesn't.

10:39.440 --> 10:43.000
It means, I am more focused
on our present situation.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.560
Getting us out of here.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.480
I'm sure Tripitaka
will think of something.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.320
Hate to break it you,
but that monk is dead.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.240
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.080
Thank you for saving me,
but I'm not leaving.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.080
What?

11:04.160 --> 11:05.840
I'm going back to save my friends.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.280
No, you're not. You're going back
to wherever it is you came from.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.440
Go back to your monastery.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.440
No, I won't. This is where I have to be.

11:13.520 --> 11:17.640
Look, Pigsy, I know you're a god.
That's why you didn't kill me,

11:17.720 --> 11:19.480
and that's why you saved me
from that demon.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.640
You can't help your true nature.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.200
I do a pretty good job of it most days.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.280
I sell gods to demons.
I evict families from their homes.

11:26.360 --> 11:28.560
-I do what a demon tells me to.
-To get by.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.400
But you don't kill people,
and you won't kill me.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.320
Well, we're in a pickle, then.
Because I told Locke you were dead,

11:34.400 --> 11:38.720
and if she sees you, I will be a liar
and my life will not be worth living.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.520
There's a solution for both of us.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.120
Yes, you walk away
and I go back to my ribs.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.120
You can help yourself, too, you know?
We can defeat Locke together.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.760
Locke is stronger than you think.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.200
She has an army of highly trained guards
and come sunset,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.400
the demon sentinels
will descend on this town like thunder.

11:56.240 --> 12:00.280
I'm sorry, Pigsy.
There's no other path for me to take.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.760
[metal clanging]

12:14.520 --> 12:16.360
[groaning and thumping]

12:27.120 --> 12:29.040
-Tripitaka--
-I'll explain later.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.040
What is this?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.760
This is Pigsy.
He's gonna help us get out of here.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.800
I want to hear it from him.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.320
I know, it's hard to believe.
I'm not even sure I believe it.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.800
But this is happening. Apparently.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.200
[Locke] You're all useless!

12:47.280 --> 12:50.040
[Pigsy groans] This way.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.240
Come on.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.680
Wait, what are you doing?
I thought you were breaking us out.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.800
Through here.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.840
[Locke] Do I have to do everything myself?

12:58.920 --> 13:00.640
-[man yelling indistinctly]
-[Locke] Right!

13:02.840 --> 13:04.080
Hurry up!

13:08.360 --> 13:09.560
Open it!

13:10.760 --> 13:12.560
Do none of you have a key?

13:13.560 --> 13:14.960
Go get me a key!

13:16.120 --> 13:17.480
Wait. What about you?

13:17.560 --> 13:20.120
I'll meet you at the town gate.
I have unfinished business.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.800
[Locke grunts]

13:27.360 --> 13:29.840
Find them. And quickly!

13:54.080 --> 13:55.080
That's the lot.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.320
Everything you've ever given me.
I'm leaving.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.160
Someone's having a moment.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.760
How about we forget this happened?

14:06.760 --> 14:07.960
Pick up your jewels.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.600
Round up the gods.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.600
We'll collect the rest of the money,

14:12.680 --> 14:14.880
get a curry in,
and I'll tickle your feet for you.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.040
No. No! No more curry nights!

14:18.120 --> 14:19.880
There will be no god delivery today.

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
[sighs]

14:21.600 --> 14:23.080
What do you think will happen

14:23.160 --> 14:24.880
when they show up
and the gods aren't here?

14:24.960 --> 14:26.960
They'll destroy everything.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.080
They'll kill everyone in the village,
and they'll take all my stuff.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.320
They won't. It's the gods they want.

14:32.400 --> 14:35.240
And what about me, huh?
Who will take care of me?

14:35.320 --> 14:36.640
You can take care of yourself!

14:36.720 --> 14:38.440
But I don't want to.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.520
[grunts]

14:40.600 --> 14:42.000
[chuckles]

14:44.080 --> 14:48.480
Why would you give all this away?
You're no good for anything else.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.520
I'm not entirely sure.

14:52.640 --> 14:56.560
You did it, Tripitaka.
You found a way to rescue us.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.600
I had a little help.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.880
But it was you who convinced him
to change his ways.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.920
Can we clam the sticky reunion
until we're actually safe?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.600
That might take a while.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.320
[clamoring]

15:11.760 --> 15:14.040
We can take these cream puffs.
There's only three of them.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.320
Oh. Tripitaka, any idea when your
new friend might be joining us again?

15:20.400 --> 15:21.880
[Pigsy screams]

15:22.640 --> 15:23.880
[groaning]

15:26.120 --> 15:27.120
[Tripitaka] Are you okay?

15:27.200 --> 15:29.400
[grunts] I'm fine.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.880
It's not the first time a woman's
thrown me off a four-storey balcony.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.680
[Locke exclaiming]

15:40.280 --> 15:41.600
[grunts]

15:42.720 --> 15:45.720
Can someone tell me what the plan is?
I think I've got a mild concussion.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.800
You take your crazy ex-girlfriend.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.600
We'll take the rest.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.040
You gods think you're so damn smart.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.560
[all grunting]

16:52.440 --> 16:53.960
[exhales heavily]

16:59.160 --> 17:01.160
[grunting]

17:04.359 --> 17:05.640
[grunts]

17:05.720 --> 17:08.599
We had a good thing going. Stop this now!

17:08.680 --> 17:10.359
I can't. I've been living a lie.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.440
Oh, really?
You think your hands aren't dirty?

17:13.520 --> 17:16.240
[laughs] You're rolling in it,
you poor husky sod.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.800
Ah, husky's just a polite word for fat!

17:18.880 --> 17:19.880
[Locke groans]

17:20.560 --> 17:22.079
-[Pigsy grunts]
-[groans]

17:31.400 --> 17:32.360
[exclaiming]

17:40.560 --> 17:41.920
[grunting]

17:48.840 --> 17:49.840
[groans]

17:53.520 --> 17:57.080
[pants] You knock me down,
and five more will take my place.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.520
[panting] Look forward to it.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.480
[Locke grunts]

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800
Guards!

18:10.840 --> 18:12.680
I said, "Guards!"

18:12.760 --> 18:13.760
[Sandy coughs]

18:16.280 --> 18:17.720
[indistinct chatter]

18:24.320 --> 18:26.080
Good people of Palawa...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.760
hear me now.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.280
For years, you have suffered
under the sickly sweet oppression

18:33.360 --> 18:36.680
of this princess demon.

18:37.760 --> 18:42.520
But on this day, my friends and I
are willing to offer you your freedom.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.120
On this day, we will rid the town

18:47.200 --> 18:49.960
of this perfumed pestilence
once and for all.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.960
Should anyone have a problem with that...

18:55.000 --> 18:56.400
[thunder rumbling]

18:57.880 --> 18:59.520
...feel free to come and have a chat.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
[sighs]

19:12.400 --> 19:14.080
[Locke] This is not the end of this.

19:14.160 --> 19:16.440
Demon forces are stronger
than ever before.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.400
You have no idea what you're walking into.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.720
Everything he sees is coming true.
He knows everything, you moron!

19:26.920 --> 19:28.360
I bought this many years ago.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.760
It blesses the journey of the gods.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.960
It promises them good spirits,
courage, luck and fortitude.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.200
Well, that's what it says
on the label, anyway.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.040
[chuckles] Thank you
for everything, Monica.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.880
You're a good girl. Take care of yourself.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.880
Sure you haven't left anything behind?

19:57.480 --> 20:00.360
Well, if I have I can buy it on the road.
It's too late now.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.280
[Sandy] "And so our heroes
set off on their journey west.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.160
United not only by their quest
to vanquish the demons

20:07.240 --> 20:09.560
and find the sacred scrolls,

20:09.640 --> 20:12.360
but through the bonds of friendship
and an unspoken desire

20:12.440 --> 20:15.600
to become the family
that they themselves never had."

20:18.960 --> 20:20.400
Too presumptuous?

20:21.920 --> 20:23.920
[crowd cheering]

20:38.000 --> 20:40.840
[Tripitaka] I feel
my master's spirit smile.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.360
Perhaps he can rest easy
knowing that we four,

20:44.920 --> 20:46.640
though not the four he imagined,

20:46.720 --> 20:50.440
take the first steps
towards fulfilling his hopes.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.720
He believed in the Monkey King
and Tripitaka.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.320
I believe in us, too.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.440
[Davari] What are we to make
of these new friends?

21:03.400 --> 21:07.440
You know you can't trust
anyone but yourself.

21:08.240 --> 21:14.360
That's why the only friends I keep
are the ones I make by my own hand.

21:19.000 --> 21:23.200
Amazing what you can create
with the hair of a god.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.520
[laughing maniacally]

21:36.400 --> 21:38.400
[theme music playing]
