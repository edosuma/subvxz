00:00.967 --> 00:02.628
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.669 --> 00:05.103
I'm really digging your new look.

00:05.238 --> 00:06.967
I really like your haircut.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.099
You love him.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.267
Please.

00:09.309 --> 00:12.972
<i>I gave my son up for adoption.
I want to find him now.</i>

00:13.013 --> 00:14.310
What are you doing here?

00:14.347 --> 00:16.042
I think I'm in trouble.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.777
The print belongs to your daughter.

00:17.817 --> 00:18.909
I think she killed him.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.852
Are you actually trying
to blackmail me?

00:20.887 --> 00:22.752
I mean,
try losing somebody your own age.

00:22.789 --> 00:24.723
- Yeah.
- You, too?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.419
<i>I lost my wife.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:30.025
I've been going to hear this guy
give these inspirational talks.

00:30.063 --> 00:31.928
"The Community
of the Phoenix. "

00:31.965 --> 00:33.933
It's time for you to go to Level Five.

00:33.967 --> 00:35.525
Bennett, what is Level Five?

00:35.568 --> 00:37.729
It's where you're reunited with Molly.

00:37.771 --> 00:41.502
Remember when Bennett was talking
about people who create drama?

00:41.541 --> 00:43.031
Daniel, your mom needs you right now.

00:43.076 --> 00:45.636
I don't need this drama in my life.

00:47.447 --> 00:50.143
Please be prepared
for what you're about to see.

00:50.183 --> 00:53.209
This footage was sent to us
by our viewers.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.087
It appears that Wilhelmina Slater

00:56.122 --> 00:58.454
has been struck blind
by the fashion gods.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.958
<i>Since the Mode diva's former lover
Connor Owens bolted</i>

01:03.997 --> 01:05.294
with the Meade millions,

01:05.331 --> 01:09.165
<i>rumors have been swirling that
la Slater is off her game.</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:10.669
Well, first came
the sudden announcement

01:10.703 --> 01:12.933
<i>that, gasp, she's leaving Mode.</i>

01:12.972 --> 01:17.068
And now with reports that
Willie's hunk of Great Barrier Beef

01:17.110 --> 01:19.135
has met an untimely demise,

01:19.179 --> 01:23.616
it appears the former fashion icon
has gone Salvation Barmy!

01:24.084 --> 01:25.551
Oh!

01:25.585 --> 01:26.677
Yikes.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.886
What is going on?

01:32.459 --> 01:34.450
<i>To answer that question,
I'm going to put Mode</i>

01:34.494 --> 01:38.191
co-editor-in-chief Daniel Meade
in The Haute Seat!

01:39.099 --> 01:41.465
Daniel, it's time to dish.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.264
Has Willie come undone?

01:43.303 --> 01:44.395
Or do you feel her pain,

01:44.437 --> 01:47.270
after having gone through
your own recent tragedy?

01:47.307 --> 01:50.071
Tragedy is not in my vocabulary,
Suzuki.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.807
To be honest with you, I feel that
Molly's with me every step of the way.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.610
Supporting me, guiding my decisions.

01:55.648 --> 01:58.378
Did she pick last month's cover?
Because it was heaven-sent!

01:59.652 --> 02:00.949
That's really funny.

02:00.987 --> 02:03.319
Seriously, just, you know,
I'd really like to take a second

02:03.356 --> 02:05.688
to talk about something
I am really pumped about.

02:05.725 --> 02:09.286
It's just this amazing organization
called the Community of the Phoenix.

02:09.329 --> 02:11.593
Okay, not doing an infomercial here.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.962
The Community teaches us

02:12.999 --> 02:15.661
to break down the barriers
between life and death.

02:15.702 --> 02:16.828
We never have to say goodbye.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.030
Or do we?

02:18.071 --> 02:19.902
- This has been The Haute Seat, with...
- See, with the wings

02:19.939 --> 02:22.737
of the Phoenix on our backs
we can accomplish anything, Suzuki.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.209
- Mmm-hmm.
- Both of us! Stand up, stand up.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.769
- Come on, stand up. Say it.
- I don't want to.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.371
- Anything. Anything.
- What is he doing?

02:28.414 --> 02:30.348
<i>- Come on, say it. Anything.
- What is he...</i>

02:30.383 --> 02:31.850
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

02:31.885 --> 02:33.819
<i>You're stretching
my turtleneck!</i>

02:38.158 --> 02:40.126
- Hey, Natalie! Is Daniel around?
- Nope.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.027
Okay, well, I just want to talk to him
about the interview he did this morning.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.530
He's super busy today,
but I'll be sure to let him know, okay?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.430
- Bye!
- Okay, thanks.

02:51.804 --> 02:54.830
Clogs, Willie? You were wearing clogs!

02:54.874 --> 02:57.001
- They're very comfortable.
- Stop it! Stop it!

02:57.043 --> 03:00.706
I am sorry about Connor,
but have you lost your mind?

03:00.747 --> 03:03.739
Listen to you!
You're talking about comfortable shoes!

03:03.783 --> 03:05.080
Has the world gone mad?

03:05.118 --> 03:07.348
Everything is not about fashion, Marc.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.095
I will let that slide
because we both know I deserved it.

03:18.131 --> 03:22.898
Willie, our futures are tied together.
Think of us.

03:22.936 --> 03:27.100
You're never gonna get another job
wearing synthetic gardening footwear.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.301
Marc, do you think I haven't tried?

03:29.342 --> 03:32.209
I've already prostrated myself
before the mummified remains

03:32.245 --> 03:34.975
of Claire Meade
and begged for my job back.

03:35.014 --> 03:36.709
- And?
- She said no.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.574
At least I think she said no.

03:38.618 --> 03:41.280
When she opened her mouth
a cloud of dust came out.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.788
So, if you'll excuse me,

03:42.822 --> 03:45.882
I need to find another way
to save my daughter's ass.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.297
Oh, hey, Mandy.
- No time.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.392
Have to get to the big editors' powwow.

03:55.435 --> 03:58.097
Matt asked me to take notes
so he doesn't miss anything.

03:58.137 --> 04:00.935
Again? Where has he been all week?

04:00.974 --> 04:03.272
Location scouting in the Bahamas.

04:03.309 --> 04:05.675
But now he's back, but he had to go
to the doctor this morning.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.737
He strained something during tennis.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.179
Hope it wasn't a groin muscle.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.479
Put some ice on it, woman.

04:11.517 --> 04:12.984
Marc, he respects me.

04:13.019 --> 04:16.216
He asked me to stay late every day
last week to go over fashion layouts.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.483
Mandy, that's not respect.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.957
It's called "I'm out of my league,
I don't know what the hell I'm doing,

04:19.993 --> 04:21.392
"please do my job for me. "

04:21.427 --> 04:23.258
You say potato.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.493
Anyway, I've decided to ask Matt out.

04:26.532 --> 04:27.556
Really? What about Betty?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.692
Shh!

04:29.302 --> 04:31.361
I thought you weren't going
the full Hartley

04:31.404 --> 04:33.634
because the furry one
still had feelings for him.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.107
Well, I wasn't.
But then I talked to Betty about it,

04:36.142 --> 04:40.511
and she said she's totally over him,
so I got the green light.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.480
And in case that conversation
happened in my head,

04:42.515 --> 04:45.484
Betty's not gonna know about it
because I'm gonna date him in secret.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.587
- Hi, furry.
- Hi, Marc.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.486
Daniel.

04:57.530 --> 05:03.059
So, I saw the Suzuki interview
and I really don't think it was that bad.

05:03.102 --> 05:06.128
- The beard's working for you.
- Oh, thank you, Betty.

05:06.172 --> 05:09.005
But maybe we can tell them
you were on allergy medication.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.942
- You know, find a way to spin it.
- Spin it?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.878
Why would we need to spin it?
You were great.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.143
I was so proud of you.

05:16.182 --> 05:18.207
Spreading the word
about the Community.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.014
You were awesome.

05:20.753 --> 05:23.449
I don't think "awesome" is the word
most people are gonna use when...

05:23.489 --> 05:25.923
Isn't it time to get the meeting started?

05:25.958 --> 05:29.018
Absolutely. Let's rock and roll!
And you can sit right next to me.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.393
Ah. Hmm.

05:32.198 --> 05:34.564
Daniel, he's staying?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.626
Yeah, of course.
And he brought some friends.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.274
Okay, people. We're shooting
this issue in the Bahamas,

05:42.308 --> 05:44.708
so let's not hold anything back, okay?

05:44.744 --> 05:46.268
Let's keep our minds focused

05:46.312 --> 05:49.543
and our pitches free
of any negatronic energy.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.478
Betty, please, kick it off for us,
would you?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.514
Sure. Um...

06:01.928 --> 06:04.192
Okay, fun fact,

06:04.230 --> 06:09.532
the Bahamas used to be
a notorious pirate haven.

06:10.069 --> 06:14.199
In fact, they were home to two of
the only known female pirates,

06:14.240 --> 06:16.538
Anne Bonny and Mary Read.

06:16.576 --> 06:20.137
So, since this is the fearless issue,

06:20.179 --> 06:21.441
I was thinking we could...

06:21.481 --> 06:23.574
Daniel, no, this is not working out.

06:23.616 --> 06:26.050
...shoot the models dressed like pirates,

06:26.085 --> 06:30.681
plundering booty,
but also showing booty.

06:32.592 --> 06:36.790
Betty, didn't pirates kill people?

06:37.330 --> 06:40.959
Well, yeah, they also had scurvy,
but I didn't think we'd focus on that.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.562
You know, more so the bandanas
and the hoop earrings.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.836
I am getting a lot of
negative energy off this idea.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.901
And we wouldn't want it
to toxify this whole meeting.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.174
So, what else have you got? Hmm?

06:55.481 --> 06:57.176
Come on, Betty.

06:58.217 --> 07:00.981
I think we can find it all together.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.686
Daniel! Daniel!

07:11.964 --> 07:15.559
I assumed it was just me
he was cutting out of his life.

07:17.904 --> 07:22.307
It all started when he hired
that girl Natalie to be his assistant.

07:22.341 --> 07:26.903
Then came the Community meetings,
the counseling sessions, the phasing.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.379
And now they're telling him
what he can

07:28.414 --> 07:30.575
and cannot put in his own magazine.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.050
Well, there's a name for people
who take over your life that way.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.212
Who make all your decisions for you,

07:35.254 --> 07:39.247
who cut you off from all the people
who care about you. It's called a cult.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.725
I need to talk to him.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.560
I don't care that I'm not
in the right phase or whatever.

07:44.997 --> 07:47.693
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.496
Mrs. Meade!

07:55.074 --> 07:57.099
Big fat package for you.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.507
Thank you, Amanda.

08:29.308 --> 08:32.505
Oh, poor baby. Let me help you.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.705
Does it hurt?

08:33.746 --> 08:37.078
It's nothing.
I just went for it diving after a serve.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.583
Were you super sweaty and panting?

08:40.753 --> 08:42.948
Not really.
Actually, it was video-game tennis.

08:42.989 --> 08:44.650
You know,
where you stand in front of the screen

08:44.690 --> 08:46.783
and wave the thing around.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.722
It's actually a really good workout.
You should try it sometime.

08:49.762 --> 08:53.254
- I'm game. Tomorrow night? My place?
- What?

08:53.833 --> 08:58.896
I just figured, since you're recuperating,
maybe I could make you dinner.

08:59.772 --> 09:03.640
- Are you asking me on a date?
- Who said anything about a date?

09:03.676 --> 09:06.543
We are just two single,
attractive people having dinner

09:06.579 --> 09:10.208
who may or may not have to get up
early in the morning.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.550
Friendly dinner sounds nice.
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.394
Daniel.

09:28.701 --> 09:31.329
Betty?
What the hell are you doing here?

09:31.370 --> 09:34.533
I didn't have a choice.
I've been trying to talk to you all day,

09:34.574 --> 09:37.566
but Natalie and Bennett
won't let me anywhere near you.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.875
Okay, look, maybe
they're a little overprotective of me.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.778
It's only because
they're looking out for me.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.615
Looking out for you?
As in running your editorial meetings?

09:46.652 --> 09:51.089
And cutting you off from your family
and everybody who cares about you?

09:51.357 --> 09:54.622
Bennett was right.
You'll never understand.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.355
I'm trying to understand, Daniel.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.363
Do you think I'd be
staking out the men's room

09:58.397 --> 10:01.332
listening to strange guys
go to the bathroom

10:01.367 --> 10:03.232
if I didn't want to understand?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.363
The copier repair guy
was in here for 20 minutes.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.531
Ugh.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.234
Betty, please.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.368
Daniel, we're friends.

10:11.410 --> 10:14.208
Why can't you just tell me
what you're going through?

10:14.246 --> 10:17.010
Look, I'm sorry.

10:17.350 --> 10:20.376
It's just something
you have to experience.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.320
You're right. I haven't experienced it.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.750
So, it's not fair for me
to judge something

10:29.795 --> 10:31.990
that seems to be helping you.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.431
What if I did an article on it?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.564
- An article?
- Why not?

10:36.602 --> 10:38.866
I could do a profile on Bennett
and the Community,

10:38.904 --> 10:40.735
get an insider's perspective.

10:40.773 --> 10:44.231
Then I could understand
why this is so important to you.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.573
Everybody could.

10:45.611 --> 10:48.637
It would be great exposure
for the Community.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.080
I spoke to Daniel.
- And?

10:53.119 --> 10:55.553
He called Bennett.
He's giving me total access.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.955
<i>A Mode exclusive
inside the Community of the Phoenix.</i>

10:58.991 --> 11:00.322
We're in.

11:28.387 --> 11:33.120
Hi, I'm Betty Suarez.
I'm here to see Bennett Wallis.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.626
Miss Suarez.

11:38.297 --> 11:40.162
We've been expecting you.

11:45.538 --> 11:46.903
Thank you.

11:48.274 --> 11:52.540
Hi. Thank you for agreeing
to do the story.

11:52.578 --> 11:57.072
Miss Suarez, you are being given
an extraordinary opportunity.

11:57.116 --> 12:01.951
No outsider has ever seen
what you are about to see.

12:02.521 --> 12:07.686
And once you do, I can't be
responsible for what may happen.

12:12.832 --> 12:16.563
I'm just messing with you. I'm sorry.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.528
People think
we're into all kinds of crazy stuff.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.973
Come on up. Let me show you around.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.943
Come on.
Can I get you some Phoenix water?

12:25.978 --> 12:27.377
No, thanks.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.206
I've already made
your travel arrangements.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.978
Coach, I'm afraid,

12:32.017 --> 12:34.952
but I'm sure you'll understand,
given the circumstances.

12:34.987 --> 12:36.955
You're sending me to Venezuela?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.684
I know people there
that'll keep you safe.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.192
What the hell am I supposed to do
in Venezuela?

12:41.227 --> 12:42.922
I don't know, Nico.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.691
Work on your tan,

12:44.730 --> 12:49.724
hone your socialist manifesto,
stay out of prison.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.567
But we had a plan. Pay off Castelar...

12:52.605 --> 12:56.473
Pay him off with what? Connor is dead.
There is no money.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.439
But I can't leave you.

12:59.478 --> 13:02.641
Okay, even if I go,
they'll still come after you.

13:02.681 --> 13:06.378
- I'll be fine, sweetheart.
- Please, Mother.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.682
Maybe I can talk to him,
work something out.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.054
I am not gonna set up
a payment plan with a blackmailer.

13:12.091 --> 13:13.456
So, unless you have another idea,

13:13.492 --> 13:16.256
I suggest you go home
and start packing.

13:16.328 --> 13:19.456
Your flight leaves first thing
in the morning.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.638
We appreciate the opportunity
to set the record straight.

13:31.677 --> 13:35.340
Most people hear about the Community
and they think we're some kind of cult.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.281
Well, isn't that understandable?

13:37.316 --> 13:40.217
I mean, a lot of what you say
is really very...

13:40.252 --> 13:41.719
- Kooky?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:42.087 --> 13:45.488
Is it kooky to help people get off drugs?
Get off the streets?

13:45.524 --> 13:48.459
Turn their lives around? No.

13:52.731 --> 13:56.963
- What's going on over here?
- Just more of our good work.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.095
Great, I'd love to see it.
I want to see all of it.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.537
And I wish you could.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.542
But that room is for
Level Seven members only.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.771
No one else can enter.
I'm sure you understand.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.143
Well, I'm trying to understand.
That's why I'm here.

14:08.180 --> 14:12.207
I'm trying to help everyone understand
more about the Community.

14:13.652 --> 14:14.880
Really?

14:15.554 --> 14:18.648
I thought it was because
you're afraid you're losing Daniel.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.717
That we're taking
your friend away from you.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.996
Nope. I assure you I am here
for the article.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.522
Please. I understand.

14:27.566 --> 14:31.593
It's painful to lose someone
you're close to, like your mother.

14:32.071 --> 14:35.438
- Excuse me?
- Your mother. You lost her, didn't you?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.538
- How do you know about my mother?
- It must have been devastating for you.

14:39.578 --> 14:42.240
Of course it was devastating.
How do you know about my mother?

14:42.281 --> 14:47.082
I can tell you miss her so much.
You think about her every...

14:47.753 --> 14:51.553
- Well, no, not every day.
- Okay, I think that's enough.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.390
Maybe you're at work
or riding the subway,

14:55.427 --> 14:59.056
suddenly you realize
you can't even remember

14:59.098 --> 15:01.794
the last time you thought about her.

15:04.503 --> 15:08.872
Every day, she's becoming more
and more difficult to see.

15:09.475 --> 15:13.241
And you hate yourself for
letting that happen, don't you?

15:13.279 --> 15:15.474
Just letting her slip away.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.014
We don't let that happen here.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.247
Ah.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.921
I'll be right there.
I'm terribly sorry, Miss Suarez.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.551
We're gonna have to reschedule.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.392
Colin here will show you the way out.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.695
I've enjoyed this immensely.

15:49.915 --> 15:53.351
Derisive laughter. I'm intrigued.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.350
Give me that!

16:02.828 --> 16:04.193
Shame!

16:07.232 --> 16:08.426
What's his problem?

16:11.670 --> 16:14.036
Laundry day!

16:32.491 --> 16:34.049
Prada help me.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.166
Oh, my God.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.471
I don't want to know this!

16:52.945 --> 16:54.879
Look, I've tried everything.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.543
- She says there's no money.
- You believe that?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.779
She's just trying to get my price down.

17:00.819 --> 17:05.188
- She's a tough bitch. You know that.
- I think she means it.

17:05.557 --> 17:10.324
- You want this to work out, don't you?
- Of course I do,

17:11.497 --> 17:13.294
Detective Castelar.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.494
Come on.

17:41.060 --> 17:45.656
- Betty? Well, what did you find out?
- Not much.

17:46.165 --> 17:50.602
Bennett was answering my questions
and telling me about their programs.

17:50.636 --> 17:52.467
- That's good.
- Well, that's what I thought.

17:52.504 --> 17:57.737
Until he started talking about me
and that I had lost my mother.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.802
Well, that's what con men do, Betty.
They prey on the vulnerable.

18:00.846 --> 18:04.407
- You think he's a con man?
- Come with me. I need your help.

18:07.686 --> 18:10.382
- You said you knew Daniel's password.
- And I do.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.823
But I don't know if I'm comfortable
hacking into his bank account.

18:13.859 --> 18:16.327
Betty, this man Bennett
wants something,

18:16.361 --> 18:19.421
and I guarantee you
it's not Daniel's soul.

18:22.968 --> 18:24.196
Okay.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.705
We're in.

18:31.243 --> 18:33.575
- Wow.
- What'd you find?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.739
Nothing. You guys have a lot of money.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.045
Would you just see
if there are any large transfers?

18:38.083 --> 18:39.277
Okay.

18:41.487 --> 18:44.684
Well, I'm not an accountant,
but this all looks really normal.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.418
What's going on?

18:47.459 --> 18:51.520
- Nothing.
- What are you doing in my office?

18:54.066 --> 18:55.931
Okay, and swing!

18:57.035 --> 18:58.229
<i>Fifteen love.
- Shoot.</i>

18:58.270 --> 18:59.430
No, no. Don't worry, you're doing great.

18:59.471 --> 19:03.430
Okay, we need to get you
in a little better position here.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.103
Just move your hips
more towards the TV.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.840
- Higher.
- What?

19:07.880 --> 19:11.008
Or you could go lower.
Either way works for me.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.451
I think this is fine.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.578
And, swing!

19:16.054 --> 19:17.544
Okay, keep your eye on the ball.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.819
Oh, oh, by the way, thanks for covering
for me in the meeting this morning.

19:20.859 --> 19:24.522
No problem.
Although, it got kind of crazy.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.054
Daniel invited all his
Flight of the Phoenix friends.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.691
Really? To the meeting?

19:28.734 --> 19:32.534
Yeah, it was all about phasing this
and phasing that.

19:32.571 --> 19:35.267
<i>It was a little too Star Trek for me.</i>

19:35.807 --> 19:38.139
Come on! Okay, that was on the line.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.940
- This thing's a liar.
- Wait, "phasing"?

19:39.978 --> 19:42.538
- Who was talking about phasing?
- Daniel.

19:42.581 --> 19:45.948
Oh, and Bennett.
He's the head guy. The big bird.

19:45.984 --> 19:50.114
- Bennett? Bennett Wallis?
- Yeah, do you know him?

19:51.790 --> 19:53.883
I mean, this is really...
This is unbelievable.

19:53.926 --> 19:57.384
You're actually breaking into my office,
going through my files.

19:57.429 --> 20:00.592
What choice did you give me?
You're cutting me out of your life.

20:00.632 --> 20:03.658
You cut me out of yours.
Sleeping with Hartley behind my back?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.101
Cal is trying to save this company,

20:05.137 --> 20:07.071
not hand it over
to a bunch of crackpots.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.766
These crackpots have helped me

20:08.807 --> 20:11.071
through the most difficult time
in my life.

20:11.109 --> 20:14.510
Daniel, if they're helping you,
then we're happy.

20:15.380 --> 20:20.374
But don't forget that we're here for you.
We just don't want you to shut us out.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.119
<i>Hello?
- Bennett, it's Natalie.</i>

20:24.590 --> 20:26.080
I'm worried about Daniel.

20:26.124 --> 20:29.992
Molly and I were barely getting started,
and she was taken away from me.

20:30.028 --> 20:33.020
And at Level Five
I caught a glimpse of her.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.758
Now, tonight I'm going to Level Seven,
and when I do,

20:36.802 --> 20:40.738
Bennett says I can be with her
whenever I want, for as long as I want.

20:40.772 --> 20:42.967
I know you think we don't understand
what you're going through,

20:43.008 --> 20:44.134
and you're probably right.

20:44.176 --> 20:47.873
But listen to yourself.
You're gonna be with Molly?

20:48.814 --> 20:51.044
That doesn't make any sense.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.659
You know what, you're right. This is
something we need to talk through.

21:02.694 --> 21:06.460
I'm gonna go get a drink of water
and we can discuss this.

21:10.669 --> 21:14.901
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.101
- Yes?
- Hi, Mrs. Meade. It's Matt Hartley.

21:21.146 --> 21:23.080
I need to speak with Daniel
about this man

21:23.115 --> 21:25.379
he's been talking to, Bennett Wallis.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.783
- What about him?
- Oh. Hi, Betty.

21:30.355 --> 21:34.018
Remember the time I told you
that I moved to Canada?

21:34.059 --> 21:36.459
Yeah, you wanted to be a Mountie.
What's that got to do with Bennett?

21:36.495 --> 21:39.464
Well, when I was up there, I got
hooked up with this self-help group,

21:39.498 --> 21:42.831
the Brotherhood of the Northern Lights.
It was run by Bennett Wallis.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.098
What exactly did this Brotherhood do?

21:45.137 --> 21:47.298
<i>Some pretty crazy stuff,</i>

21:47.906 --> 21:50.374
but their big thing is that
they promised people

21:50.409 --> 21:52.309
that they could talk
to their dead loved ones.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.209
I mean, they'd give them
this special tea

21:54.246 --> 21:58.512
that they said helped bring down the
veil between this world and the next.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.279
They drugged you?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.184
No, not me. I only made it to Level Two.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.120
But by the time you make it
to Level Seven

22:04.156 --> 22:06.420
they have you on
some pretty strong stuff.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.222
It got pretty scary. Someone died.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.720
Oh, my God.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.592
Where's Daniel?

22:17.002 --> 22:19.232
Daniel! We need to talk!

22:19.271 --> 22:21.171
Daniel?
- Daniel!

22:31.650 --> 22:33.049
You're sure he's in there?

22:33.085 --> 22:34.712
Yeah, he's one of their
celebrity members.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.779
- They're gonna close ranks around him.
- Celebrity members?

22:37.823 --> 22:39.757
Bennett was always looking
for high-profile people

22:39.791 --> 22:40.849
that he could rope in.

22:40.892 --> 22:41.950
I mean, that's why he wanted me,

22:41.993 --> 22:44.325
he was basically trying
to get to my dad.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.160
They're getting everything
they want from Daniel.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.495
People are probably
joining the Community

22:47.532 --> 22:49.762
in droves because of him.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.004
What?

22:54.039 --> 22:58.499
Not that I don't appreciate the help,
Amanda, but what are you doing here?

22:58.543 --> 23:00.773
I was in that cult for like
five minutes last week,

23:00.812 --> 23:02.006
so I know how they operate.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.173
And when the shirt hits the flan,

23:03.215 --> 23:04.648
you're gonna want me
on your team, Suarez!

23:04.683 --> 23:07.618
Can we focus, please?

23:07.652 --> 23:09.813
How are we going to get
Daniel out of there?

23:09.855 --> 23:11.914
Well, I'm sorry,
I don't know if I'm gonna be much help.

23:11.957 --> 23:16.018
Bennett and I left on pretty bad terms.
I was banished for life.

23:16.061 --> 23:20.191
Do you know what would happen
if I even showed my face in there?

23:23.368 --> 23:24.426
What?

23:25.570 --> 23:27.868
Hey! Hey! Get your hands off me!

23:27.906 --> 23:29.931
Do you know who I am?

23:31.610 --> 23:33.373
Okay, whoa!

23:34.146 --> 23:35.636
Watch the thumb, watch the thumb. Oh!

23:37.549 --> 23:40.541
Willie! Willie!
I have to tell you something!

23:40.585 --> 23:43.611
- What is it, Marc?
- Nico and Castelar...

23:44.923 --> 23:47.118
For God's sake, spit it out.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.726
Are you wearing my shoes?

24:04.209 --> 24:06.439
Mother, what's going on?

24:06.478 --> 24:09.970
Marc just brought me
some rather troubling information.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.508
- I saw you.
- What?

24:12.551 --> 24:15.520
On the street, canoodling with Castelar.

24:16.755 --> 24:19.280
Tell me this is not true, Nico.

24:21.159 --> 24:22.683
- It's true.
- Ha!

24:23.195 --> 24:25.220
You were going to send me away.

24:25.263 --> 24:27.629
To live with cousins
I've never even met.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.463
And I had to come up
with some other way.

24:29.501 --> 24:31.969
So, yes, I went to Castelar.

24:32.404 --> 24:35.430
I tried to bargain with him,
get him to take less.

24:35.674 --> 24:39.041
What I saw looked awfully cozy
for a negotiation.

24:43.114 --> 24:45.582
He said he would take less,

24:45.617 --> 24:49.246
but only if I was willing

24:49.721 --> 24:52.781
to offer him something
to sweeten the deal.

24:54.125 --> 24:58.755
I tried to go through with it, Mother,
because I didn't want to leave you.

24:59.097 --> 25:02.794
But I couldn't. I'm so sorry.

25:09.074 --> 25:14.239
Ha! You don't actually believe
this load of horse apples? Willie?

25:16.248 --> 25:17.579
- Get out.
- Willie, you can't possibly...

25:17.616 --> 25:19.846
Get out of my house, Marc.

25:37.836 --> 25:40.304
Let's go.
I said watch the thumb!

25:40.338 --> 25:43.671
Place is a labyrinth.
Are you sure this is the right way?

25:43.708 --> 25:45.699
I think it's just right up here.
Level Seven.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.371
The smell of crazy's getting stronger.

25:49.247 --> 25:51.340
Come on, come on, come on.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.214
Go.

26:09.367 --> 26:10.834
Here we are.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.168
Are you here for the session?

26:16.641 --> 26:18.040
Absolutely.

26:18.977 --> 26:22.504
- And we're really pumped to be here.
- That's good.

26:22.547 --> 26:26.847
Though most people aren't really
pumped to be in grief counseling.

26:27.485 --> 26:30.113
What she means by "pumped" is,

26:30.155 --> 26:35.024
pumped full of emotion that she has
no idea how to deal with, as am I.

26:35.060 --> 26:40.396
That seems like a good place to start.
Why don't you tell us about your loss?

26:41.666 --> 26:43.896
- Amanda, we should be going.
- My mother died.

26:43.935 --> 26:46.335
- Amanda.
- I never even knew her.

26:46.371 --> 26:48.168
She put me up for adoption.

26:48.206 --> 26:52.700
Just when I figured out who she was,
she was gone.

26:53.311 --> 26:54.471
How did it happen?

26:54.512 --> 26:57.276
- A terrible accident.
- She murdered her.

27:10.662 --> 27:15.759
Not everyone who starts this journey
is strong enough to finish it.

27:17.402 --> 27:20.599
You two have proven that you are.

27:41.393 --> 27:44.123
- Do you want to be with Robbie?
- Yeah.

27:45.930 --> 27:49.798
- Are you ready to be with Molly?
- I am.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.468
Oh!

27:56.808 --> 28:00.539
- It's a lot stronger than before, huh?
- You said you were ready.

28:00.578 --> 28:03.342
I hope I haven't
misplaced my faith in you.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.330
Daniel!

28:28.406 --> 28:31.807
- No, you have the wrong address.
Sorry.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.370
It's okay. Continue.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.856
I always knew
that I was born to fashion.

28:49.894 --> 28:55.594
I mean, this is not just some
off-the-rack sperm and egg collision.

28:55.633 --> 28:58.898
You know, it's destined, it's genetical.

28:58.937 --> 29:04.000
So when I found out that Fey Sommers
was my mother, this fashion icon,

29:04.509 --> 29:08.377
my life finally made sense.
But then it was all taken away.

29:09.447 --> 29:11.381
I'm so very sorry.

29:14.452 --> 29:18.616
I think Fey would be very proud of your

29:19.924 --> 29:21.653
fashion sense.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.719
I'm not mad that you murdered her.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.128
I'm just mad that you murdered her

29:26.164 --> 29:29.099
before I had a chance
to get to know her.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.629
Oh.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.070
Guys, we've got to go.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.181
You're sure he wasn't there?

29:45.216 --> 29:47.241
I checked every other room on the floor.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.343
We have to think.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.580
Where would they have taken him?

29:49.621 --> 29:52.613
- Hey, Matt. Where are you?
- I'm in jail.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.522
Trespassing and disturbing the peace.

29:54.559 --> 29:57.357
- Wait, jail?
- Here. Matt, he wasn't in there.

29:57.395 --> 29:59.124
Wait, what?
What do you mean he wasn't there?

29:59.164 --> 30:00.597
- Where else could he be?
- I don't know!

30:00.632 --> 30:03.192
I'm not the cult expert, you are.
You tell me.

30:03.234 --> 30:04.667
Okay, okay.

30:04.702 --> 30:08.229
Well, the whole point
of Level Seven is that

30:08.273 --> 30:10.400
you make this total connection

30:10.441 --> 30:11.703
with the person
that you're trying to reach.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.576
So you surround yourself
with their things.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.239
Touch their clothes,
smell their perfume.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.771
He never packed up Molly's apartment.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.512
Molly's apartment!
He's at Molly's apartment!

30:20.552 --> 30:22.611
You guys are just
gonna leave Matt in jail?

30:22.654 --> 30:24.588
We don't have time.
We've got to get to Daniel. Come on.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.455
On my team,
you never leave a man behind.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.226
Whatever. Brooklyn, please.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.165
Could either of you spare
some bail money?

30:40.271 --> 30:41.829
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.000
I never should have tried
to send you away.

30:44.042 --> 30:48.138
But what are we going to do now?
You said we were out of options.

30:48.580 --> 30:49.945
Maybe not.

30:53.785 --> 30:58.518
36, 24, 36.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.586
My measurements.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.169
It's a family heirloom.

31:12.570 --> 31:16.267
I think it's worth more than enough
to satisfy Castelar.

31:17.041 --> 31:20.442
You've had this all along?
Why didn't you say anything before?

31:20.478 --> 31:23.345
It's the one thing I vowed I'd never sell.

31:23.781 --> 31:27.717
And there's only one thing
more important to me in this world.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.558
I have a few loose ends to tie up
at the office tomorrow morning,

31:34.592 --> 31:37.322
but I'll be back by 10:00,

31:37.362 --> 31:40.627
and then we'll take the necklace
and head straight to the airport.

31:40.665 --> 31:43.031
We'll stick together
and get through this.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.796
No matter what.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.439
Can you feel her, Daniel?

31:58.583 --> 32:00.813
Can you feel Molly's presence?

32:00.852 --> 32:03.286
No, I'm not sure.

32:04.689 --> 32:07.817
Focus. Feel their energy.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.356
Draw them to you.

32:10.395 --> 32:13.796
I'm trying, I just, I really...
I don't think it's...

32:14.198 --> 32:15.426
Daniel.

32:23.141 --> 32:24.369
Molly.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.514
- You're here.
- Yes, Daniel, I'm here.

32:30.581 --> 32:33.914
I can't believe this is you.
This is amazing!

32:35.486 --> 32:38.478
Daniel!
- I can't allow you in here.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.218
They're in a very delicate state.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.692
You'll be in a delicate state
if you don't step aside.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.662
I am onto you. I know who you are.

32:45.697 --> 32:47.927
And if you've done
anything to harm my son,

32:47.966 --> 32:51.697
I will sue your ass
right out of this world.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.330
Yeah!

32:54.505 --> 32:57.133
- Now...
- Don't even think about it.

32:58.343 --> 33:01.471
Molly, I missed you so much.

33:01.512 --> 33:05.209
- I know. I've missed you, too.
- Well, we can be together now.

33:05.249 --> 33:08.150
I mean, we can be together forever.
That's all I ever wanted.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.448
Me, too.

33:09.854 --> 33:12.084
Oh, I can't believe you're here.

33:12.123 --> 33:17.618
Daniel, remember when I told you
I never wanted you to forget me?

33:17.662 --> 33:20.290
And I never ever will.

33:20.331 --> 33:23.528
But you have to, just a little bit.

33:24.268 --> 33:28.261
- What are you talking about?
- This isn't real, Daniel. I'm gone.

33:28.773 --> 33:32.265
And you can't live your life
pretending that I'm not.

33:36.547 --> 33:39.573
You have to let her go.

33:39.617 --> 33:41.949
Daniel, you have to let her go.

33:41.986 --> 33:46.082
Wait, who's her?
Molly, I did this for you.

33:46.124 --> 33:50.424
- To be with you.
- Daniel, let Molly go.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.994
Why are you calling yourself Molly?
Stop! Okay?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.966
- Let her go.
- I can't.

33:57.935 --> 34:00.062
I never got to say goodbye.

34:02.440 --> 34:05.102
Then say it now. I'm right here.

34:07.678 --> 34:09.440
Say goodbye to me.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.074
Goodbye, Molly.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.364
Daniel.

34:35.473 --> 34:36.871
Betty?

34:39.643 --> 34:40.940
Mom?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.710
Darling, are you all right?

34:45.949 --> 34:47.007
Oh!

34:47.051 --> 34:48.143
Are you okay?

34:48.186 --> 34:50.620
Daniel, stay with us.
Son, are you all right?

34:50.655 --> 34:51.849
Can you hear me, Daniel?

34:56.994 --> 35:00.953
- Daniel, are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

35:01.466 --> 35:04.401
I still think we should go to the hospital.

35:07.605 --> 35:11.974
Natalie, wait.
Look, you don't have to go with him.

35:12.944 --> 35:16.107
Just because you're giving up,
don't expect me to.

35:16.147 --> 35:19.480
- Listen to me.
- We were supposed to do this together.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.747
- I know.
- I can't see Robbie

35:21.786 --> 35:25.244
unless you are with me. Bennett said.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.053
Bennett has been using you
to get to me.

35:30.394 --> 35:31.884
So, it's all about you?

35:31.929 --> 35:33.829
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Robbie was there!

35:33.865 --> 35:35.560
That's not real.

35:37.168 --> 35:38.430
Bennett's been drugging us.

35:38.469 --> 35:42.735
I saw your face, how happy you were.

35:45.042 --> 35:48.409
- Tell me that wasn't real.
- Natalie, please.

35:48.913 --> 35:53.577
You have to say goodbye to Robbie.
You can get on with your life.

35:53.618 --> 35:57.076
I thought it was you that was
gonna help me get there,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.753
but I guess it has to be someone else.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.619
Here, let me help you.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.457
- Thank you.
- Open.

36:37.495 --> 36:40.555
You don't have to feed me, it's... Okay.

36:40.798 --> 36:41.992
Mmm.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.258
- I feel like a dork.
- Why?

36:44.302 --> 36:47.533
Because I'm feeding you like a baby?
Big bite.

36:48.573 --> 36:51.303
No. Because I got thrown in jail
and you had to bail me out.

36:51.342 --> 36:53.469
Whatever. You totally saved the day.

36:53.511 --> 36:56.173
We never would have found
Daniel without you.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.011
You're kind of my hero.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.243
Incoming.

36:59.283 --> 37:00.545
Mmm.

37:01.018 --> 37:05.148
But we never got to finish our date.
Dinner, friendly dinner.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.516
Can I make it up to you?

37:09.860 --> 37:12.124
I think I can squeeze you in.

37:14.765 --> 37:16.392
Amanda.
- Hi.

37:17.568 --> 37:21.095
I just wanted to say how glad I am

37:21.138 --> 37:24.596
we were able to clear
some things up last night.

37:24.642 --> 37:25.768
Me, too.

37:25.810 --> 37:28.802
I took, "You've reached the office
of the murderer," off your voicemail.

37:28.846 --> 37:31.076
Well, I appreciate that.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.910
He was a beautiful baby.

37:40.324 --> 37:42.383
- Excuse me?
- Your son.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.227
The one you put up for adoption.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.993
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.065
You think a personal
and confidential letter

37:50.101 --> 37:52.035
from the South Dakota
Department of Child Services

37:52.069 --> 37:55.561
crosses my desk
and I'm not going to steam it open?

37:57.775 --> 37:59.140
Call him.

38:13.324 --> 38:15.224
This is Claire Meade.

38:15.259 --> 38:20.458
I'd like to book a flight from New York
to Rapid City, South Dakota.

38:37.715 --> 38:40.115
- I prayed I wouldn't find you here.
- I was just getting everything

38:40.151 --> 38:42.210
- ready for our trip.
- Please, don't.

38:42.253 --> 38:44.517
Do me that one final courtesy.

38:47.858 --> 38:51.157
- All right.
- There never was a murder, was there?

38:51.195 --> 38:53.095
No blackmailing detective.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.997
Just like there wasn't any plan
for us to run away together.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.694
Yes, there was a plan.

38:57.735 --> 39:00.203
You just showed up an hour early.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.268
So, who's your partner in crime, Nico?

39:03.808 --> 39:06.242
Wait, let me guess, Castelar?

39:06.677 --> 39:10.943
Oh, no. Castelar is really your dead
boyfriend Jonathan, isn't he?

39:11.515 --> 39:15.110
Why, Nico?
What did I do to deserve this?

39:15.152 --> 39:16.915
What did you do?

39:18.522 --> 39:20.490
Where do I even start?

39:20.925 --> 39:23.359
How about sending me away

39:23.394 --> 39:26.955
because you were too busy with your
career to even give a damn about me.

39:26.997 --> 39:30.057
How many times did I even
see you growing up, Mother?

39:30.101 --> 39:32.865
How many holidays
did we spend together?

39:33.504 --> 39:35.768
Are you surprised? Really?

39:36.707 --> 39:39.642
I mean, I thought you'd be proud of me.

39:39.677 --> 39:42.976
Because after all you did
to screw me up,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.448
I'm still my mother's daughter.

39:48.352 --> 39:49.717
Get out.

39:51.422 --> 39:54.482
I never want to see you again.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.662
You'll get what you want, Mom.

40:03.267 --> 40:04.894
You always do.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.020
Donate or a keeper?

40:29.860 --> 40:31.020
Oh.

40:31.328 --> 40:33.853
<i>That was actually Molly's
Sunday morning New York Times,</i>

40:33.898 --> 40:36.924
coffee and a croissant T-shirt.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.592
So, it's a keeper.

40:39.637 --> 40:41.901
No, you can pitch it out, it's fine.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.600
You know, Daniel,
just because you're saying goodbye

40:43.641 --> 40:45.905
doesn't mean you have to
get rid of everything.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.036
Well, yeah.
I can't hang on to everything either.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.171
It's just a crappy old T-shirt.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.648
Well, it doesn't matter if it's valuable.

40:52.683 --> 40:56.016
It's about what it means to you,
like my necklace.

40:57.254 --> 40:59.188
The pearls aren't real.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.623
It doesn't go with everything I wear,

41:01.659 --> 41:04.787
but my mom gave it to me,
so it was a keeper.

41:10.935 --> 41:13.904
All right, I'll put it in the keep pile.

41:15.806 --> 41:18.798
You know, I meant to ask you
something about the other night.

41:18.843 --> 41:23.212
Remember when I was kind of
off in Level Seven Land,

41:23.247 --> 41:26.080
and I thought I was
kissing Molly goodbye

41:26.116 --> 41:30.712
and kind of woke up
and you were standing right there,

41:30.754 --> 41:32.881
sort of in front of me?

41:36.093 --> 41:38.186
Did... Did we...

41:39.230 --> 41:41.892
Yeah. Sort of.

41:41.932 --> 41:43.832
I mean, you kissed me
around the eyebrow.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.961
I'm a lot shorter than Molly.

41:46.003 --> 41:49.996
Okay. Right, okay. All right.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.732
Ugh. What about these?

41:54.345 --> 41:57.371
- Get rid of them, please.
- Thank you.

41:58.382 --> 42:00.577
I never trusted Natalie.

42:01.018 --> 42:05.546
- I told you that from the beginning.
- Yes, you did. You're always right.
