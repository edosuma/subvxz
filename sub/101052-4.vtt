Jasmine Delancey.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.864
(phone clicking)

13:01.947 --> 13:02.990
(chimes)

13:06.118 --> 13:07.369
(Jasmine chuckles)

13:11.790 --> 13:14.084
<i>JASMINE:</i>
<i>Hi. I'm Jasmine Delancey.</i>

13:17.630 --> 13:19.215
(sighs)
You know,

13:19.298 --> 13:21.884
I first learned how to play
the guitar from my mom.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.886
You know? She taught me
how to play at our lake house

13:23.969 --> 13:26.722
on her old guitar,
which I still have.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.890
(chuckles)

13:27.973 --> 13:30.226
{\an8}And my sister Zara and I would

13:30.309 --> 13:32.561
{\an8}sit by the fire
and make up songs.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.564
<i>When my mom passed away, I was</i>
<i>asked to sing at her funeral.</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:38.567
<i>I sang a song that Zara and I</i>
<i>had wrote for her.</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:41.570
<i>Everyone was looking back</i>
<i>at me, and they weren't crying.</i>

13:41.654 --> 13:43.405
Like my music had stopped them
from crying.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.408
I'll never forget
thinking, "Wow.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.118
(laughs)
I did that."

13:48.202 --> 13:50.079
My music did that.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.834
Hey, Jasmine!

13:55.918 --> 13:57.253
I'm rooting for you.
(whoops)

13:57.336 --> 13:58.712
JASMINE:
Hey, thanks.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.382
{\an5}-Who was that?
-I don't know, it's just...
weird.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.009
(panting)

14:04.093 --> 14:06.887
Oh, wait. Come on.
I need a break.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.264
-ZARA: Are you serious?
-Yeah.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.140
-What...?
-Let me get one of them, man.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.269
-Oh, very heart-healthy.
-You got any cash?

14:14.311 --> 14:16.605
Here you go.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.649
It's on the house. Big fan.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.775
-Of mine?
-Yeah.

14:19.858 --> 14:21.986
I mean, if you feel like
following me on social media...

14:22.069 --> 14:23.904
Hi. Excuse me.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.573
I'm so sorry to bother you.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.449
Can I get a picture?
I'm a huge fan.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.493
(laughs)
Sure.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.292
Perfect. I hope you win.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.626
Thank you.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.753
ZARA:
What is all this?

14:41.338 --> 14:42.840
I sing pretty good.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.592
I... Not that good.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.343

<i>Zara!</i>

14:57.563 --> 14:59.315
(both laugh)

14:59.398 --> 15:01.984
I mean, she looks pretty great,
doesn't she?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.820
She looks... chilly.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.489
-Hmm?
-Is that the front of the dress?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.659
-Yeah.
-Oh. Okay.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.786
No, it's, um...

15:12.870 --> 15:16.498
It is...<i> blah.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:18.500
-It's called fashion, Zara.
-No, it just, it doesn't...

15:18.584 --> 15:20.336
It doesn't seem
like your style is all.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.671
You're cool. You should be you.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.590
The hell are you talking about?
I am me.

15:24.673 --> 15:28.344
Imagine if I wore this
to surgery. Right?

15:28.427 --> 15:31.680
Yeah, I'm just saying, like,
you should look like yourself.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.098
I am myself.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.058
Ooh.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.225
I'm Jasmine.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.394
Okay, Jasmine.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.981
You doing one-name status now?
You like Prince or Beyoncé?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.650
{\an8}I just, I mean, look at those.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.151
{\an8}I-I just think
you should wear something

15:44.234 --> 15:45.361
{\an8}that makes you feel comfortable.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.196
{\an8}The hell are you talking
about, Z?

15:47.279 --> 15:50.032
{\an8}Comfortable? I'm not trying
to be comfortable up there.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.700
{\an8}Nobody's comfortable.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.327
{\an8}You're standing
in front of hundreds of people

15:53.410 --> 15:55.371
{\an8}who are just staring at you.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.873
{\an8}Millions more on TV
watching you.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.708
{\an8}(quietly): I'm wasting my breath
trying to explain this to you.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.920
-You're just a doctor.
-I'm <i> just</i> a doctor?

16:03.003 --> 16:05.381
Yeah, you're a doctor.
I'm the artist.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.383
Yeah, I save lives.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.344
-I make life worth living.
-How exactly do you do that?

16:10.427 --> 16:13.055
By singing from my soul.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.683
Cool. Um, well,
that's not only pretentious,

16:15.766 --> 16:18.686
it's also
scientifically impossible.

16:18.769 --> 16:20.312
(sighs)
All right, Jas.

16:20.396 --> 16:24.316
Well, uh, can't wait
to see how far you get

16:24.400 --> 16:26.568
{\an5}-on your meaningless
little singing show here.
-Meaningless?

16:26.652 --> 16:29.488
Okay, yeah. 12 million people
watch this meaningless show.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.573
I'm just saying that
at some point, you're gonna have

16:31.657 --> 16:34.118
to come back down to Earth
and figure your shit out.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.412
You sound real jealous, Z.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.081
Why would I be jealous of you?
You're broke.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.999
I'm broke? What the fuck
is wrong with you?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.626
-I'm sorry, I...
-Shit.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.753
You know what? Y-You don't have
to come tonight, okay?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.089
Just stay home.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.716
{\an5}-Jasmine, that's not
what I meant...
-No, I think...

16:48.799 --> 16:49.925
I think that's best.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.927
Don't come. Just stay.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.054
It's fine.

16:54.138 --> 16:58.142
Hell, just gonna be more nervous
having you there anyways.

Hey. Peace offering.

I missed it last night.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.833
Clearly, you were amazing.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.544
Yeah, no, I wasn't.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.129
I was actually pretty awful.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.549
-No.
-I <i> was,</i> Z. I-I sang off-key,

20:59.633 --> 21:02.469
I forgot the frickin' chords,
and-and yet they clapped.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.013
I mean, even <i> Dad</i> clapped.
That man's got perfect pitch.

21:05.097 --> 21:09.309
Well, you must have done good,
'cause you won, right?

21:09.393 --> 21:12.187

21:12.270 --> 21:14.481
Okay, I'm gonna say something,

21:17.401 --> 21:19.695

21:19.778 --> 21:22.197
But I just need you
to stay open, you know,

21:22.280 --> 21:24.032
and not give me any of that,

"Well, this is scientifically
impossible" bullshit

21:26.368 --> 21:28.495
-that you like to say.
-Okay.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.540
Fiji gave me this coin
right before she died,

21:31.623 --> 21:34.835
and ever since then...
I don't know, man.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.170
I-I-I-I, I mean, like,

21:37.254 --> 21:40.215

They hear me.

21:40.298 --> 21:43.927
And even, like, I'm wondering,
you know, is it this coin?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.887
Is there something
in this coin that's, like,

21:45.971 --> 21:46.888
making all this happen?

21:46.972 --> 21:48.432
Because prior to this,

or even paid attention to me.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.235
'Cause I sucked last night.

22:00.318 --> 22:02.571
I don't know.
Is there something in this coin

22:02.654 --> 22:03.947
that's making all this happen?

22:04.990 --> 22:07.534
Yeah. No, I mean...

22:07.617 --> 22:09.369
it actually makes
a lot of sense.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.954
Yeah, right?

22:11.038 --> 22:13.457
Yeah, like, why would
all these people

22:13.540 --> 22:16.209
be clapping for someone
who just won

22:16.293 --> 22:18.086
the world's biggest
singing competition?

22:18.170 --> 22:21.548
Yeah, no, why, why?
Why would they like that?

22:21.631 --> 22:24.342

a very popular program.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.554

22:27.637 --> 22:28.972

all superstitious

underwear at the World Series?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.313

25:13.803 --> 25:16.139
I just want you to know.
(chuckles)

25:16.223 --> 25:18.433
Are people clapping at home?

25:21.436 --> 25:24.105
-Right, right. (laughs)
-I think

25:24.189 --> 25:26.233
there might be a little bit
of talking.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.109
The-the first question
I have to ask you:

25:28.193 --> 25:31.529
What was the inspiration
for your famous song?

25:31.613 --> 25:34.324
Ah, you know,

25:34.407 --> 25:36.785
Fiji inspired "Fire Lady."

25:36.868 --> 25:39.579
I wouldn't be here
without her, you know?

25:39.663 --> 25:41.915
(cheering, applause)

25:41.998 --> 25:43.458
JASMINE:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.668
Yeah. No, Fiji was special.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.503
-She was... she really was.
-(cheering, applause continue)

25:46.586 --> 25:48.296
I think they're saying
<i>you're</i> special.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.590
This is...

25:50.674 --> 25:52.259
This isn't
every guest gets this, you know.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.178
These-these people love you.

25:55.262 --> 25:57.597
-Wow. Wow.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.932

26:00.558 --> 26:02.143
we're riding a wave here.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.478
I got an idea.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.230
Would you sing your song
for us?

26:05.313 --> 26:06.356
