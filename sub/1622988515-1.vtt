01:40.458 --> 01:41.833
Smile for the selfie!

01:45.083 --> 01:48.125
Not my phone!

01:56.375 --> 01:58.167
I got it.

02:07.667 --> 02:08.625
A birdie!

02:43.210 --> 02:46.028
Zoom, zoom,

02:46.228 --> 02:47.628
Zip!

02:47.828 --> 02:51.180
Zoom, zook,

02:51.380 --> 02:54.131
zoom, zoom, za!

03:14.083 --> 03:16.750
Hey Alex, you wanna play ball?

03:18.083 --> 03:20.208
- Get back here!
- Woops!

03:22.375 --> 03:24.375
Ah geez! What'd you do that for, Kid?

03:24.458 --> 03:26.792
I'm doing something important.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.292
Can't you play a little?

03:29.375 --> 03:32.000
- Pretty please?
- I don't have time today.

03:32.292 --> 03:35.000
We'll have lots of time to
play at Grandpa's house.

03:35.125 --> 03:36.667
How does that sound?

03:38.208 --> 03:39.417
Okay then.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.333
Game Over, unveiling...

03:42.625 --> 03:44.875
Rosie. Rosie!

03:45.625 --> 03:47.000
You wanna play?

03:47.208 --> 03:49.900
♪ You're never comin' back,
yeah, Cupid's arrow, ♪

03:50.100 --> 03:51.495
♪ gave me a heart attack. ♪

03:51.567 --> 03:53.216
♪ Hey, hey, don't you
leave me this way ♪

03:53.416 --> 03:56.293
♪ Stay, stay, be a good dog and stay ♪

03:56.667 --> 03:57.542
Yeah!

04:04.958 --> 04:05.625
Kid!

04:08.500 --> 04:10.369
What d'you want?
I'm tryin' to dance here.

04:10.569 --> 04:11.791
<i>That's what you were doing?</i>

04:12.091 --> 04:13.833
I thought you had
fleas in your pants.

04:13.917 --> 04:16.458
- Come play with me!
- No, no, no, no.

04:16.541 --> 04:17.541
Not right now.

04:17.666 --> 04:20.541
I'm busy perfecting my moves for
Pomeraniums Got Talent.

04:20.833 --> 04:22.792
Later. We'll play at Grandpa's.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.542
Look, I'm glowing.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.583
That's the face of a queen!

04:30.750 --> 04:33.208
Or maybe... a celebrity!

04:33.333 --> 04:35.083
The next Kim Kakapo!

04:35.167 --> 04:36.500
Hey, listen up!

04:36.583 --> 04:38.763
I need tea, now!

04:38.963 --> 04:40.877
Lisa, who're you bossing around?

04:41.208 --> 04:43.833
I'm just practicing for when
I have assistants.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.792
Do you wanna play with me?

04:45.875 --> 04:49.625
All appointment requests must
go through my secretary.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.625
Get ready!

05:01.750 --> 05:04.208
'Cause it's time... for fun!

05:08.500 --> 05:10.000
Let's see what we got.

05:12.042 --> 05:14.833
Not a single new subscriber yet.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.167
Looks like I need ideas.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.000
What else can I do?

05:21.167 --> 05:23.208
I thought people loved dumb gags.

05:23.292 --> 05:24.083
Hello!

05:24.167 --> 05:25.583
- Wanna play?
- Kid.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.000
I need your help.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.333
Whaddya think?
Help me become famous.

05:29.417 --> 05:31.083
I need more views.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.208
He's famous!

05:35.500 --> 05:37.500
You could be like Super Dog!

05:43.750 --> 05:45.833
That's it! You're a genius!

05:46.250 --> 05:48.292
- Oh, yeah!
- Hurray!

05:48.500 --> 05:51.167
- So that means you can play now?
- Nope.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.072
Ooh.

05:57.875 --> 05:59.750
Hi! I'm Kid Barker.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.583
And I've never made
a video before, but...

06:02.750 --> 06:04.667
Let me tell you about something I love.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.958
I have the best siblings in the world.

06:07.125 --> 06:08.583
It's gonna be summer soon,

06:08.708 --> 06:11.583
- and then we're gonna play all the time.
- Hey!

06:12.000 --> 06:14.458
Paws off the vlogging
equipment, little buddy.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.000
- That stuff's for big kids only.
- Okay, sorry.

06:17.083 --> 06:20.083
- Just trying to get views.
- That's real nice.

06:20.333 --> 06:21.917
Next time, just turn it on.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.083
Oh, brother!

06:24.500 --> 06:26.250
I know. Here!

06:26.333 --> 06:28.167
You can borrow this for a while.

06:33.208 --> 06:34.750
Hey, hey hey!

06:34.833 --> 06:37.042
Welcome back to my channel, everybody!

06:37.250 --> 06:39.625
Back again with your favourite vlog.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.250
And, get ready guys!

06:41.333 --> 06:43.917
'Cause your boy's got something
super crazy planned!

06:44.125 --> 06:46.000
Or more like, Super Dog!

06:46.083 --> 06:47.833
Well... You know what I mean.

06:47.917 --> 06:48.583
Yeah.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.869
With strength, power,

06:52.069 --> 06:53.669
and smarts too.

06:53.708 --> 06:54.833
Still watching?

06:55.042 --> 06:57.500
Well that's good, 'cause there's
just one thing I still need.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.875
A Jetpack.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.125
Where can I find one?

07:01.333 --> 07:02.667
I know where to go.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.292
Don't click away!

07:04.417 --> 07:07.208
This nerd here, is my brother, Alex.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.208
He's real smart at that science stuff.

07:09.292 --> 07:10.250
Watch!

07:10.583 --> 07:13.042
- Hey, make me a Jetpack.
- Can it wait?

07:13.167 --> 07:14.208
This is important.

07:14.292 --> 07:16.906
It's the culmination of my
whole life's work.

07:17.106 --> 07:18.206
Yeah, sure dude.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.542
You haven't even lived that long.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.000
What's this thing? Does it move?

07:21.083 --> 07:22.250
How 'bout this? I'ma poke it.

07:22.333 --> 07:23.917
- Poke!
- No! Don't touch that!

07:26.417 --> 07:27.958
What did you do?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.542
That's mine!

07:33.250 --> 07:36.250
Got the grabby thing,
lets play grab the scientist!

07:36.500 --> 07:38.583
Okay, fine. I'll make it for you.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.042
A Jetpack. Just leave me alone.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.042
Gimme that.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.833
You heard it here first.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.708
He's really gonna make me a Jetpack!

07:46.792 --> 07:48.917
Stay tuned for more
super cool updates!

07:49.042 --> 07:52.000
Maybe my next vlog will be two
thousand feet in the air!

07:52.083 --> 07:53.208
Better hit subscribe.

07:53.292 --> 07:56.792
Peace out, super vlogger Max,
up, and away!

07:56.917 --> 07:57.958
Catch you next time!

08:08.667 --> 08:11.292
- We're here!
- I can't believe it!

08:14.417 --> 08:16.455
I forgot how huge it is!

08:16.655 --> 08:18.371
I feel like a pop star!

08:21.500 --> 08:25.250
Seven, eight, nine...

08:25.667 --> 08:26.542
Rosie!

08:26.833 --> 08:29.167
Our time capsule is still here.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.583
Lisa!

08:30.708 --> 08:32.332
Look! I found our dolls.

08:32.707 --> 08:35.000
I forgot how cute they are!

08:39.750 --> 08:42.082
My very own laboratory!

08:42.500 --> 08:45.333
Now I can finally work in peace.

08:55.083 --> 08:55.917
Hey!

08:56.083 --> 08:58.583
Don't start without me!
I'm coming!

09:03.292 --> 09:04.875
Hey! Watch it!

09:04.958 --> 09:07.417
- Quit that shakin'.
- Sorry.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.125
- I'm trying!
- Then try harder.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.292
It's this hill.

09:10.542 --> 09:14.333
- It's so... huge!
- I never said it'd be easy.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.292
That's good.

09:24.167 --> 09:25.333
Relax.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.333
This was a first test.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.417
That look on your face. Priceless!

09:47.500 --> 09:49.417
It was just a trick. Got ya!

09:49.583 --> 09:51.333
The hill, the boat.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.000
I planned all of it. Get it?

09:54.208 --> 09:55.583
Good one!

09:56.542 --> 09:59.000
- But who put the boat here?
- Good point.

09:59.417 --> 10:02.125
<i>- How did it get here?
- I remember!</i>

10:02.208 --> 10:03.458
Granny told me.

10:03.542 --> 10:07.125
The old sailor who lives there
takes his grandkids on boat rides.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.458
- It's got to be his.
- I don't like it.

10:09.667 --> 10:12.125
This is our place. We're the
only ones that swim here.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.083
- Oh, this is a public dock.
- What'd you just say?

10:17.833 --> 10:20.708
- But, they should know better.
- Exactly.

10:20.792 --> 10:22.875
We don't want visitors. No way.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.792
Let's get to our field.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.833
Yay!

10:30.917 --> 10:34.583
Now that we're here,
everyone will play with me!

10:39.583 --> 10:42.333
- Grandpa! You first!
- First for what?

10:42.458 --> 10:44.875
Well, I'm gonna play
with everyone here,

10:44.958 --> 10:46.708
but you're up first.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.917
So. What're we playing?

10:51.917 --> 10:53.250
Umm, how about Laser Wag?

10:53.458 --> 10:57.208
- Or World of Woofcraft?
- World of...What?

10:57.417 --> 10:59.000
Of Woofcraft.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.917
Can't say I know it.

11:01.000 --> 11:05.292
Now when I was a kid, we played
like we were brave Warriors.

11:05.375 --> 11:07.792
- How'd you do it?
- Come on, I'll show you.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.083
It's been a long time.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.833
But they must be around
here somewhere.

11:18.417 --> 11:19.833
The slingshot.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.625
The special kite.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.292
And look!

11:26.542 --> 11:28.500
This bow belonged to your dad.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.792
So cool. How do you play Warriors?

12:29.750 --> 12:30.833
Oh, I get it!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.625
Can we play now?

12:41.375 --> 12:42.750
What on earth?

12:43.167 --> 12:46.583
- What is this?
- It's a swing!

12:46.917 --> 12:48.792
I'm not blind, I'm just sayin'.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.417
- This place used to be our lookout.
- Well...

12:51.583 --> 12:54.833
I guess someone else must've
found it while we were gone.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.708
Someone else?

12:57.000 --> 13:00.500
I bet my whiskers it's that
old hound's yippy grandkids.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.167
- Granny told me they're called the Barkers.
- Ahh, the Barkers.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.958
- Good to know.
- Maybe they didn't know this was our spot?

13:10.083 --> 13:11.375
Of course they did.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.458
This was a direct attack on us.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.708
Now quit stalling, and help me.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.083
Now first, we're gonna counter attack,

13:19.333 --> 13:21.667
by sabotaging their little swing set.

13:25.667 --> 13:28.042
- And second?
- And second...

13:29.000 --> 13:31.708
Gotta learn more about
these shaggy dogs.

13:31.958 --> 13:34.750
Let's see. We've got Barkes, Barcos.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.000
Aha! Got 'em.

13:36.125 --> 13:39.083
It appears one of these Barkers has a vlog.

13:39.458 --> 13:40.292
Hey, friends!

13:40.458 --> 13:42.500
Just hold out a little bit longer.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.083
Barker's Jetbelt is on it's way!

13:45.167 --> 13:49.000
And any day now, we're gonna
start running our first test flights.

13:49.208 --> 13:52.333
For now, hit me up with some likes,
and stay tuned.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.333
Max Barker out.

13:56.042 --> 13:58.175
- What on earth is a Jetbelt?
- I dunno.

14:23.076 --> 14:24.147
Huh.

14:24.648 --> 14:25.648
Hmm.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.167
Sure looks like someone's been busy.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.125
So it's done?

14:36.126 --> 14:37.126
Huh?

14:37.042 --> 14:38.542
My Jetpack.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.917
Not just yet.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.292
It's like I said, there's something...

14:43.375 --> 14:46.667
- Something that I have to finish up first.
- What do you have to finish up?

14:46.917 --> 14:48.000
You promised!

14:48.500 --> 14:51.500
- I know I did, but first...
- There's no "but first".

14:51.583 --> 14:52.583
You promised.

14:52.667 --> 14:53.833
First the Jetpack,

14:53.917 --> 14:56.000
- then you work on this.
- Come on!

14:56.083 --> 14:58.000
Just let me... have it!

15:00.750 --> 15:02.583
Fine, you win.

15:02.708 --> 15:05.583
- I'll work on it now.
- Now you're talking.

15:05.708 --> 15:06.583
Here you go.

15:06.833 --> 15:09.417
- I know you'll keep your word.
- That's right, Max.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.792
I'll take care of it.

15:15.417 --> 15:18.917
- You mean you'll take care of it first.
- Yes.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.458
Now, go!

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Well? How's it going?

15:46.250 --> 15:47.542
So, is it ready?

16:02.708 --> 16:04.167
Surprise!

16:06.042 --> 16:08.667
But where... Where's my device?

16:08.750 --> 16:09.833
Where'd you put it?

16:10.833 --> 16:12.000
Trashcan.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.042
<i>What?</i>

16:15.667 --> 16:18.000
Celebrity gossip.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.542
I don't believe it!

16:19.750 --> 16:22.417
Brad Pitbull is getting divorced!

16:23.208 --> 16:25.625
Prince Hawrry is looking for a fiance!

16:27.583 --> 16:29.250
Should I send him <i>my picture?</i>

16:29.375 --> 16:30.375
I wonder...

16:30.500 --> 16:32.625
He'd have to wait 'til I grow up,
of course.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.667
I can picture it now.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.125
Prince Hawrry arrives,

16:36.208 --> 16:38.750
He's just dashing, and he... asks me!

16:38.833 --> 16:40.750
Well, Lisa, you ready?

16:43.332 --> 16:44.332
Eww.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.125
It's you.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.625
- What d'you want?
- I want to play Warriors with you!

16:49.000 --> 16:50.583
I don't have enough to do?

16:50.667 --> 16:53.042
I have to peel these potatoes for dinner!

16:54.917 --> 16:57.333
- Can I be in charge?
- <i>I will be the leader.</i>

16:57.583 --> 17:00.667
- And you will tend to the hearth.
- I'm tending the hearth now.

17:00.750 --> 17:01.917
No deal.

17:02.292 --> 17:03.167
I know...

17:03.583 --> 17:05.708
How about this?
You're the Princess,

17:05.750 --> 17:07.790
and you can even wear a tiara!

17:09.165 --> 17:11.958
I'll do it, but you'll have to peel
all the potatoes while I...

17:12.040 --> 17:15.250
Hooray! I'll go round up
everyone else!

17:16.000 --> 17:18.333
Hey! You forgot these!

17:18.958 --> 17:21.040
Well in that case, our deal is off.

17:23.458 --> 17:24.415
Hey!

17:24.790 --> 17:26.250
Alex and Max!

17:26.500 --> 17:27.915
What're you doing?

17:29.542 --> 17:31.000
- Come on, let's go.
- Where're you going?

17:31.125 --> 17:33.833
Just you wait. Just you wait!

17:35.500 --> 17:37.875
- What now?
- Hey Max, just quit your game.

17:37.958 --> 17:39.917
Let's all play Warriors.

17:43.375 --> 17:47.667
- Lisa says she wants to play too.
- Hey, how about taking a break?

17:47.750 --> 17:49.583
Let's all play Warriors!

17:50.125 --> 17:52.083
Oh, I'll show you "Warriors".

17:52.417 --> 17:53.375
Let me have that.

17:54.167 --> 17:54.917
And that.

18:00.042 --> 18:03.000
- Give up now, Max.
- Which trashcan did you put it in?

18:03.125 --> 18:04.458
I never threw it away.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.292
It's behind the greenhouse.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.958
Behind the greenhouse.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.375
- What about playing our game?
- Tough luck.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.875
No Warriors.

18:14.042 --> 18:15.708
Alex won't play with us.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.583
Hey, how's it going?

18:28.125 --> 18:29.750
Close call.

18:32.417 --> 18:35.333
How do you expect me to work
under these conditions?

18:35.417 --> 18:39.083
It's impossible to concentrate
with all these interruptions.

18:39.167 --> 18:39.917
What?

18:40.042 --> 18:42.958
Who's interrupting you?
I'll take care of them.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.375
- Tim, it's Tim!
- Yes! He made it!

18:46.750 --> 18:49.708
- Up here, Tim.
- Hey, Max. What's up?

18:49.792 --> 18:52.667
- Are you on break?
- For the whole week!

18:52.875 --> 18:54.458
- Awesome!
- Can you believe it?

18:54.542 --> 18:56.208
Tim's here for the whole week!

18:57.875 --> 19:01.167
Don't worry Alex.
I won't let anybody else bother you.

19:02.167 --> 19:03.500
Yelp if you need me!

19:04.208 --> 19:06.583
No-one will bug you as long as I'm here.

19:10.542 --> 19:11.375
Grandpa!

19:12.083 --> 19:15.333
- Have you seen Tim?
- No.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.792
He was just here.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.625
Where could he have gone to?

19:20.417 --> 19:21.917
Have you seen Tim?

19:22.750 --> 19:24.958
- I haven't.
- That's weird.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.333
Look! Suddenly everyone wants Tim.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.750
Yes, Lisa said she'd play Warriors.

19:30.875 --> 19:34.000
- Now I have to find Tim and Rosie.
- Oh, now I see.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.542
Well, keep searching then.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.042
You have a mission.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.625
Okay, now you go.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.250
How was that?

19:55.083 --> 19:57.958
Awesome! You'll be like
Napalmeranian in no time!

19:58.042 --> 20:00.708
That fits right in with my superstar plan.

20:20.417 --> 20:21.375
Rosie...

20:21.542 --> 20:23.625
Rosie, you're the best dancer ever!

20:23.750 --> 20:26.042
And I wanted to... to say that...

20:28.750 --> 20:31.708
That I... Well, I...

20:31.958 --> 20:33.208
That you... what?

20:34.167 --> 20:37.500
Nothing. It's just something
I wanted to say to you.

20:37.583 --> 20:39.000
Well, just say it then.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.083
You can say anything to me.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.333
- I mean, Bob from school...
- What?

20:44.417 --> 20:46.958
- Who is this Bob?
- Hey!

20:47.125 --> 20:50.083
Finally, I found you guys. Yay!

20:50.417 --> 20:55.250
And now the great Warrior Kid Barker
has captured you both!

20:56.417 --> 20:58.500
I was just going to say that he...

20:59.167 --> 21:03.417
- is a good dancer. Okay?
- Who is a good dancer?

21:04.250 --> 21:06.125
- Nobody.
- Okay.

21:06.208 --> 21:08.250
So, you guys aren't captured.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.625
But, I'd still like you
to play my game.

21:10.708 --> 21:13.500
- Tim, let's pretend to be Warriors.
- Kid!

21:13.833 --> 21:16.244
What're you even doing here?
All by yourself?

21:16.444 --> 21:18.244
I'm not all by myself.
I'm with you.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.809
And you know you promised
that you would play with me

21:20.809 --> 21:22.109
when we got to Grandpa's house.

21:22.208 --> 21:24.792
- Go home now!
- What?

21:30.167 --> 21:32.163
So, what about Bob?

21:32.363 --> 21:34.735
Bob, schmob. It doesn't matter.

21:35.083 --> 21:38.208
It's just sort of cool that
he knows how to dance.

21:38.292 --> 21:39.417
That's all.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.375
Well, it's true!

21:55.167 --> 21:56.667
Bob from school!

21:56.792 --> 21:58.167
Well, excuse me!

21:58.458 --> 21:59.917
I'm outa here.

22:02.583 --> 22:03.792
I knew it.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.167
No-ones gonna play with me.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.000
All hopes and plans ruined.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.000
A failure.

22:24.792 --> 22:26.625
A six letter word...

22:27.542 --> 22:29.417
- Fiasco
- That's it!

22:29.500 --> 22:30.750
And now down...

22:30.917 --> 22:33.250
A state of the abscence of light...

22:33.458 --> 22:34.167
Four letters...

22:34.292 --> 22:37.708
- The second letter is 'A'.
- Dark.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.708
- Are you done peeling potatoes?
- Of course.

22:41.792 --> 22:42.708
- Are you hungry?
- Uhuh.

22:42.792 --> 22:43.833
We'll eat soon.

22:43.958 --> 22:45.000
Go eat an apple.

22:45.083 --> 22:48.000
- Can we play Warriors?
- What about Warriors?

22:48.083 --> 22:49.417
Why don't you go play?

22:49.667 --> 22:51.208
Can't you see I'm busy?

22:51.458 --> 22:54.500
- Fine, I won't play with you either.
- What?

22:55.292 --> 22:57.250
I won't play with anyone.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.000
You all lied to me.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.958
Well, I don't see anyone flyin'.

23:07.167 --> 23:08.292
Somethin's up.

23:09.792 --> 23:12.417
There's barely a cloud, but no flying.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.792
What if they do start flying?

23:15.917 --> 23:17.250
What do we do then?

23:18.292 --> 23:19.708
Shoot 'em down.

23:21.958 --> 23:25.208
How about we just throw some
slimy toads in their yard?

23:25.458 --> 23:26.667
Somethin' like that.

23:26.792 --> 23:30.333
Fluffy, did your Granny give
you any grub to munch on?

23:30.708 --> 23:32.167
I'm famished.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.667
I've got a donut.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.167
Okay. Stop your lazin'.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.042
We've got a job to do.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.167
Why d'you have all
these ropes in here.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.042
Oh! It isn't rope.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.083
It's Macrame. Check this out.

23:47.375 --> 23:49.000
My Granny taught me.

23:52.292 --> 23:55.375
- It's a little bunny.
- It's makin' me sick.

23:55.542 --> 23:58.000
Bunny's are lame. Everybody knows that.

23:59.042 --> 24:01.542
Huh. What a stupid word, 'Macrame'.

24:01.625 --> 24:03.417
Who comes up with this stuff?

24:05.333 --> 24:06.708
<i>Mac-rame!</i>

24:13.333 --> 24:14.925
They promised and promised,

24:15.125 --> 24:18.112
and still... I'm alone.

24:18.312 --> 24:20.917
Well, they're gonna be sorry.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.667
I'm going to have so much
fun without them.

24:23.792 --> 24:26.083
I'll play all by myself!

24:26.583 --> 24:30.000
I don't need anyone to be
the king of the Warriors!

24:31.833 --> 24:34.167
They'll all beg to play with me.

24:34.667 --> 24:36.750
But I'm not going to let them!

24:37.708 --> 24:38.958
Yeah!

25:16.917 --> 25:18.958
Hey pups. What's your name?

25:20.458 --> 25:24.250
- I am the great Warrior Kid Barker!
- Oh, hello Kid.

25:24.375 --> 25:25.875
You're pullin' my paw!

25:25.958 --> 25:27.250
Great Warrior!

25:31.500 --> 25:32.917
Hey Kid, wait up.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.542
Did you say... Barker?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.833
- As in Max Barker?
- Yes, he's my brother.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.250
But, who cares about him?

25:39.375 --> 25:42.833
- What're you doing here, anyway?
- We're here on a secret mission!

25:45.667 --> 25:46.750
It's a game.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.875
We've been playing... spies.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.958
Like you've been playing Warriors.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.228
We just happen to <i>love</i> Warriors.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.648
But, nobody will play with me.

25:55.948 --> 25:57.667
They all promised that they would.

25:57.792 --> 26:00.208
- But they won't.
- I've got an idea.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.875
Why don't we play with you?

26:18.583 --> 26:19.667
Giddyup!

26:19.967 --> 26:21.013
Wahoo!

26:25.625 --> 26:26.333
Yeah!

26:28.083 --> 26:29.250
Yay!

26:31.250 --> 26:34.000
By the way, your brother's
working on a fancy gadget.

26:34.042 --> 26:35.208
He calls it a Jetbelt.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.000
D'you know anything about that?

26:37.458 --> 26:40.000
Yeah, I think Alex is making
something like that.

26:40.208 --> 26:41.200
Giddyup! Whoo!

26:47.708 --> 26:50.083
I, the great Warrior, Kid Barker

26:50.333 --> 26:52.333
take you as my prisoner.

26:52.542 --> 26:53.625
Okay, okay.

26:53.833 --> 26:56.525
Now it's time for you to play
our game, called...err...

26:57.083 --> 26:59.000
Super Spies!

26:59.875 --> 27:01.954
But I don't know how
to play that game.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.654
How to explain it to you? Hmm.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.000
Okay, look.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.875
It's all about carrying out
secret missions.

27:09.958 --> 27:11.000
For example...

27:11.250 --> 27:14.333
You find out everything about,
say, the Jetbelt.

27:18.708 --> 27:19.833
You know...

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
Like - when it's gonna fly.

27:21.042 --> 27:24.000
- Let's just play... Warriors
- First the mission,

27:24.167 --> 27:27.042
and then... more Warriors.

27:27.458 --> 27:30.208
So go on, and complete your
mission, and come on back.

27:30.292 --> 27:32.958
But Grandpa won't let me
back out again today.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.333
Not 'til tomorrow.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.042
Not 'til tomorrow?

27:37.250 --> 27:39.167
Well, tomorrow it is.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.274
And tomorrow,
the great Warriors will play.

27:42.274 --> 27:44.274
Do you have any slingshots,
and bows?

27:44.292 --> 27:46.583
Of course we do. We're pros.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.625
Well, see you tomorrow then.

27:49.792 --> 27:52.833
But don't say a word
about this to anyone.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.792
Remember, our mission is top secret.

27:56.125 --> 27:58.125
- Get it?
- Got it.

27:58.750 --> 27:59.542
Good.

27:59.750 --> 28:01.958
- 'Til tomorrow.
- Bye bye!

28:04.375 --> 28:05.708
And you, Fluffy...

28:06.000 --> 28:07.667
have your own secret mission.

28:07.875 --> 28:11.583
- I believe your Granny had a rooster.
- I already gave you a donut!

28:11.750 --> 28:14.000
Not to eat, now go get him.

28:14.167 --> 28:15.500
We need his feathers.

28:15.833 --> 28:18.708
How else do you expect
us to become Warriors?

28:51.583 --> 28:55.167
- Good morning, sir.
- And good morning to you.

28:55.417 --> 28:56.583
Nice weather, eh?

28:57.417 --> 28:59.000
Where are you off to, Tim?

29:00.792 --> 29:01.875
I'm leaving.

29:02.042 --> 29:03.500
I have to.

29:04.292 --> 29:07.417
To be a superhero, or a biochemist.

29:07.500 --> 29:08.792
Or whatever.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.042
Timothy...

29:15.833 --> 29:17.458

29:18.658 --> 29:19.778

31:04.375 --> 31:06.708
And they're going to play with me!

31:09.042 --> 31:10.417
Morning, Grandpa!

31:10.542 --> 31:12.917
- I'm off to play.
- Hey, Kid.

31:13.125 --> 31:17.042
- Where're you going?
- I have a super top secret mission!

31:17.500 --> 31:18.708
Sounds important.

31:18.917 --> 31:21.458
But later, let's build a wigwam.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.792
Oh, there's Max.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.750
Just the one I'm looking for.

31:27.875 --> 31:31.458
- I need some top secret information.
- Hey! Keep it down.

31:31.792 --> 31:35.292
I'm trying to do the same thing you are,
but Alex is totally off his leash.

31:35.417 --> 31:38.667
I need information for my livestream,
but he won't let me in.

31:38.875 --> 31:39.708
Check it out.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.875
Alex! Hey, Alex!

31:47.792 --> 31:49.000
Hey, let it go!

31:49.750 --> 31:50.833
It's gone!

31:54.375 --> 31:56.583
Oh no, that's Grandpa's.

31:57.167 --> 31:58.583
Alex won't let me in

31:58.708 --> 32:01.542
- but maybe he'll talk to you.
- It's worth a try.

32:01.792 --> 32:04.917
But play it cool, and take your time,
or he'll get nervous.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.333
So, talk about the weather,

32:06.417 --> 32:08.000
and get me my info.

32:12.750 --> 32:15.208
Alex, I'm just here to talk
about the weather.

32:15.292 --> 32:16.583
Can I come up?

32:20.042 --> 32:21.583
Lisa!

32:23.417 --> 32:24.833
Right here.

32:25.417 --> 32:27.958
Oh no! Not potatoes again.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.292
Are you for real? You didn't
even peel them yesterday.

32:31.417 --> 32:34.167
So we all had to eat left-over
macaroni again!

32:34.333 --> 32:36.958
- And I'm sick of it.
- But I can't right now.

32:37.167 --> 32:40.542
I'm writing to a certain
high profile individual.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.833
Did you know they have
Dogstagram profiles too?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.542
Just peel these already!

32:45.750 --> 32:47.833
Write your fanmail later!

32:51.833 --> 32:54.708
I know you're just mad
because Tim left.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.792
Wait! Where did he go?
- Where do you think? He went home.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.542
I saw him this morning.

33:01.625 --> 33:03.936
He was making a beeline
for the train station.

33:04.036 --> 33:04.636
But...

33:04.667 --> 33:06.542
That doesn't mean that
he's going home.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.583
He probably just went to
get me some flowers.

33:09.708 --> 33:10.917
Yeah, that's it.

33:10.917 --> 33:11.517
Uhuh.

33:11.600 --> 33:12.558
With all his stuff?

33:12.642 --> 33:15.167
There's a whole field of daisies
on the way to the station,

33:15.250 --> 33:16.792
so maybe...

33:17.583 --> 33:21.333

33:21.417 --> 33:24.583

anyone you want to.

33:32.875 --> 33:35.875
Check this out! Here's Justin Beagle.

33:36.292 --> 33:38.375
And here's Prince Hawrry Dog

33:53.292 --> 33:55.587
It's a useless energy draining toy

33:55.587 --> 33:57.587
that someone else will invent,
soon enough.

33:57.625 --> 34:00.208
- It's not a big deal.
- But are you making it?

34:00.667 --> 34:02.583
And when is it gonna fly?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.167
Kid, what's up with you?

34:05.250 --> 34:07.583
Aren't you old enough to
know better by now?

34:07.708 --> 34:10.625
Look, a whole cabinet
full of useless toys,

34:10.708 --> 34:12.375
just like this Jetbelt.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.292
I made them for fun.

34:14.375 --> 34:17.292
Or perhaps, out of the
deep love for my craft.

34:17.417 --> 34:20.042
The self-watering can,
ascension firecrackers,

34:20.125 --> 34:21.625
the alarm clock massager.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.333
This one was actually interesting,

34:23.458 --> 34:25.458
but that's a story for another time.

34:27.042 --> 34:29.083
Oh, the ball that bounces by itself!

34:32.958 --> 34:35.250
Yeah yeah. A ball, who cares?

34:35.375 --> 34:37.661
Now, let me show you something that will

34:37.761 --> 34:39.650
change the world of science forever.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.250
The Exoskeleton!

34:42.333 --> 34:46.000
Surely the most important
invention created by cat or dog.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.000
It'll replace all kinds of machines.

34:48.083 --> 34:50.167
Production, construction,

34:50.250 --> 34:52.083
even stuff in outer-space!

34:52.167 --> 34:54.833
- Can you imagine?
- I <i>can</i> imagine!

34:55.000 --> 34:58.750
Now what about the Jetbelt? Come on,
tell me when it's gonna fly!

34:59.042 --> 35:02.208
No! No-one will ever understand me.

35:03.458 --> 35:06.500
Alright. I'll build the stupid
Jetbelt right now!

35:06.583 --> 35:09.375
You can't fool me.
I know Max sent you.

35:19.042 --> 35:19.958
Voila!

35:20.042 --> 35:22.125
- Like it?
- Yeah!

35:22.333 --> 35:24.667
- Go call Max.
- Max!

35:25.250 --> 35:27.083
Oh! I just happened to
be right here and...

35:27.250 --> 35:29.750
Woah! Are you finished?
- Yup.

35:29.958 --> 35:30.875
Put it on.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.500
Woah!

35:39.500 --> 35:41.458
Something's buzzing.
I feel buzzing!

35:41.542 --> 35:44.042
Alex, you did it! Yeah!

35:44.750 --> 35:47.083
Kid! You head outside and
film me when I fly out.

35:47.250 --> 35:50.583
- Alex, do you think it'll fly?
- Lower your visor.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.292
Lowering...

35:52.375 --> 35:54.125
Up, up and away!

35:57.875 --> 35:59.792
Alex, I'm really flying!

36:00.000 --> 36:02.500
Yelpin' Yorkies, I'm flying!

36:05.458 --> 36:06.875
How did you ever do it?

36:07.958 --> 36:10.375
Max, come on this way.

36:10.458 --> 36:11.833
Fly over here.

36:14.208 --> 36:16.125
Alex, somethings wrong.

36:16.208 --> 36:19.083
- Why am I not flying outside?
- It's too soon.

36:19.167 --> 36:20.667
It's not finished yet.

36:20.833 --> 36:23.250
Right now, it can only be
controlled remotely,

36:23.333 --> 36:25.292
and the signal might not reach.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.375
Well, when will you be finished with it?

36:28.875 --> 36:30.833
- Tomorrow.
- That's awesome!

36:30.917 --> 36:33.542
Alex, you're a rock star.
I knew you could do it!

36:37.000 --> 36:39.875
Now I can finally get
back to my real work.

36:44.625 --> 36:47.000
What's up? Hey, hey, hey!

36:47.833 --> 36:50.208
Wait until you see what's coming!

36:51.000 --> 36:53.125
Stay tuned for the premier video

36:53.375 --> 36:56.000
of my first ever test flight!

36:56.458 --> 36:58.125
And, if you tune in tomorrow,

36:58.250 --> 37:00.458
you're gonna see a real demonstration

37:00.542 --> 37:03.708
of the one and only Barker Jetbelt!

37:03.792 --> 37:06.625
What does he mean, 'demonstration'?

37:06.833 --> 37:08.875
And who was he talking to?

37:09.750 --> 37:12.417
Does this mean I set him up to fail?

37:18.708 --> 37:19.667
Kid!

37:19.750 --> 37:21.500
Where are you, Kid?

37:24.208 --> 37:25.625
There you are.

37:27.708 --> 37:31.333
- Hi Grandpa. Did you call me?
- I was indeed calling you.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.875
Everything is ready.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.333
Let's build a tent.

37:34.458 --> 37:37.292
- I've gathered all we'll need.
- Hey, Grandpa.

37:37.417 --> 37:39.458
Think we could build it later?

37:40.375 --> 37:43.542
- Later?
- Yeah, it's just... Well...

37:43.625 --> 37:45.375
You know my secret mission?

37:45.500 --> 37:47.000
I haven't finished it.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.917
Sure. Later, then.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.625
Hey, wait up! Grandpa!

38:10.792 --> 38:13.667
I'll go run and ask Lisa to
help me with something.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.958
And then you and me can build the tent.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.542
Yeah? Alright then.

38:19.625 --> 38:22.250
I thought maybe you didn't want
to play with me anymore.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.333
That's crazy! You're lots of fun.

38:24.417 --> 38:25.542
I'll be right back.

38:29.042 --> 38:30.167
Lisa!

38:30.833 --> 38:32.958
Lisa, I need your help with something.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.833
It's really important.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.958
It has to do with Grandpa.

38:37.458 --> 38:40.500
I hurt Grandpa's feelings and
I have to make it up to him.

38:42.167 --> 38:43.333
I've got to play with him,

38:43.417 --> 38:46.167
so can you give a message to
my friends in the forest?

38:46.333 --> 38:49.083
- Please help.
- What friends in the forest, huh?

38:49.208 --> 38:51.417
- And why come to me?
- Pretty please?

38:51.583 --> 38:53.500
Over by the swings in the big lawn.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.125
There will be two kids there.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.000
Amazing! We finally have
real kids in our forest.

38:59.542 --> 39:02.833
Lisa, I really need you to
give them a message. Please?

39:02.917 --> 39:05.125
Everyone wants me to help
them with something.

39:05.208 --> 39:08.250
- But no-one will help me!
- I'll help you...

39:08.958 --> 39:10.917
With the potatoes?

39:11.750 --> 39:15.458
Well, I guess all queens and
celebrities do things,

39:15.542 --> 39:19.333
like visiting heads of foreign
states and things like that.

39:20.167 --> 39:21.958
I need to get used to this.

39:22.250 --> 39:25.375
- I'll visit your friends.
- Thankyou so much.

39:25.542 --> 39:27.042
So what's your message?

39:27.917 --> 39:31.083
Tell them I can't come today.
I'll come tomorrow.

39:31.167 --> 39:33.208
And the Jetpack. It works!

39:33.417 --> 39:35.667
- Got it all?
- It's not poetry.

39:35.750 --> 39:36.708
No problem.

39:42.042 --> 39:43.500
Why am I dressed like a turkey?

39:43.625 --> 39:45.917
- And what's keeping that mutt?
- He's just a kid.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.542
He probably forgot.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.208
Or maybe it's lunchtime.

39:49.333 --> 39:52.667
- Speaking of which, I'm hungry.
- Oh no you don't.

39:53.917 --> 39:55.417
Come on. Get up.

39:56.750 --> 39:57.625
Look sharp.

39:58.042 --> 39:59.292
Stick out your jaw.

39:59.375 --> 40:02.375
- This feels weird.
- We've gotta make you look more menacing.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.792
Lesson one - always be ready.

40:08.250 --> 40:09.542
Suck in that gut.

40:10.417 --> 40:11.292
Like this?

40:12.167 --> 40:13.542
Well, it's a start.

40:13.750 --> 40:16.083
You go practice.
I'll take care of lunch.

40:16.792 --> 40:19.417
Especially if it's another donut.

40:27.667 --> 40:31.333
Just tighten it here,
and it's finished.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.292
Grandpa.

40:32.750 --> 40:35.792
- Can I go inside?
- Of course, that's what it's for.

40:36.375 --> 40:38.167
Oh, and I grabbed a couple
of things for you.

40:38.292 --> 40:40.792
Now you can go set up
your new home, young Warrior.

40:40.917 --> 40:42.083
Thanks, Grandpa.

40:43.833 --> 40:44.833
Grandpa?

40:45.583 --> 40:47.125
I need some advice.

40:47.667 --> 40:50.875
You see, I've made a mess of things.

40:51.292 --> 40:53.375
I promised I'd make Max a Jetbelt.

40:53.542 --> 40:55.875
- And?
- I didn't do it.

41:00.875 --> 41:01.917
Yes!

41:02.250 --> 41:05.625
This is so cool and mysterious.

41:07.917 --> 41:11.583
I think I might sleep here
the whole night.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.958
Home sweet home!

41:14.375 --> 41:17.708
And also, the Warriors' hideout.

41:17.917 --> 41:20.708
Sounds like it was really important to Max.

41:20.792 --> 41:23.042
But Grandpa, my invention!

41:23.125 --> 41:26.958
Isn't my great masterpiece
just as important?

41:27.667 --> 41:28.542
Oh, Alex!

41:28.708 --> 41:30.208
It's time that you learned

41:30.375 --> 41:33.542
what matters most is family.

41:34.292 --> 41:37.625
And we must all try our best
to be there for each other.

41:38.458 --> 41:40.625
Sometimes it can be hard to remember.

41:41.042 --> 41:43.500
But we're all on the same team here.

41:44.125 --> 41:45.208
Do you hear me?

41:46.375 --> 41:48.625
- I hear you.
- Okay.

41:49.542 --> 41:52.000
Then maybe you should
tell Max the truth.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.458
Hey Alex. Look!

41:54.583 --> 41:56.250
What do you think of our wigwam?

41:56.333 --> 41:57.833
It's the Warriors hideout.

41:57.917 --> 42:01.250
- Come look inside.
- I'm sorry Kid, but I have to...

42:01.958 --> 42:03.667
I gotta do a thing.

42:04.208 --> 42:05.458
Oh! I almost forgot.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.333
I also brought you some rope.

42:07.750 --> 42:09.750
- Do you know why?
- No.

42:10.042 --> 42:12.917
So you can make a real Warrior trap.

42:13.042 --> 42:13.917
A trap?

42:14.167 --> 42:14.875
Yes.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.667
- All Warriors make these.
- What for?

42:18.125 --> 42:21.125
As protection, from your enemies.

42:28.125 --> 42:29.083
Not yet.

42:29.583 --> 42:31.125
I'll tell him later.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.208
Let's see...

42:36.292 --> 42:38.417
Better, effective, but painless.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.083
Hey!

43:02.875 --> 43:05.625
- What's goin' on here?
- Wow!

43:06.333 --> 43:10.000
Are you two like,
actual real life Warriors?

43:10.083 --> 43:12.167
None of your beeswax, now scram!

43:12.667 --> 43:16.292
Well I never. You don't deserve
to hear what I have to tell you.

43:16.375 --> 43:19.083
Not that you care, but I have a
message from my brother, Kid.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.375
But there's no way I'll tell you now.

43:22.500 --> 43:23.875
Uhh, Kid sent you?

43:24.083 --> 43:25.958
Why didn't you say so?

43:26.375 --> 43:28.042
He's our leader.

43:28.417 --> 43:30.917
Oh please. Accept our sincerest apologies

43:31.000 --> 43:32.792
- and tell us we're forgiven.
- No!

43:33.208 --> 43:36.167
- I couldn't possibly.
- Oh, pretty please?

43:36.250 --> 43:40.208
- Kid's message is so very important to us.
- So what.

43:41.708 --> 43:42.792
How about this?

43:42.875 --> 43:45.542
If you give us the message,
then we'll let you play with us.

43:45.708 --> 43:47.333
You can be a Warrior too.

43:48.258 --> 43:49.625
Umm, nope.

43:49.750 --> 43:50.625
What else you got?

43:51.208 --> 43:52.666
Did you know that Warriors

43:52.766 --> 43:56.386
treat their high profile
individuals like royalty?

43:56.686 --> 43:58.125
And, since you're the Chief's sister

43:58.208 --> 44:00.625
- you would be on the 'A' list for sure.
- What?

44:00.750 --> 44:02.125
The Chief's sister?

44:02.292 --> 44:04.792
He is the Chief's brother.
You get it?

44:04.958 --> 44:07.000
So I guess, I'm your Chief now.

44:07.083 --> 44:10.875
No, your Queen. And a Queen always
forgives her servants.

44:11.333 --> 44:13.792
Okay. Let my reign begin.

45:38.542 --> 45:40.625
Who knew ruling was so hard?

45:40.875 --> 45:41.875
I need a nap.

45:41.958 --> 45:44.833
- Okay. Bye now!
- Hey! What about the message?

45:45.083 --> 45:45.958
Oh yeah.

45:46.167 --> 45:48.958
Kid says he's sorry,
but he can't meet you today.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.125
- Not 'til tommorrow
- That's it?

45:51.333 --> 45:53.625
- Anything else?
- Oh yeah.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.625
There was something else.

45:55.708 --> 45:58.458
Something about a jet thing, flying.

45:58.542 --> 45:59.500
Okay, bye.

45:59.833 --> 46:00.833
This was fun.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.625
There really is something
regal about her.

46:17.833 --> 46:19.000
My Queen!

46:19.833 --> 46:22.333
Not to mention, she likes my bunny.

46:23.292 --> 46:24.500
Enough with the bunnies.

46:24.625 --> 46:27.000
- Look. It really does fly.
- Look! I'm actually flying!

46:27.958 --> 46:29.667
So, change of plans.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.677
We're gonna take that Jetbelt
for ourselves.

46:32.777 --> 46:33.777
But why?

46:33.792 --> 46:36.958
So we can fly over fences
and spy through windows.

46:37.083 --> 46:40.792
- You mean, you wanna steal it?
- Get your head in the game.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.125
It's time that we take
these Barkers down,

46:44.542 --> 46:46.792
and show them who's
King of this place.

46:47.042 --> 46:49.792
- But stealing's bad.
- We'll give it back.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.958
We're just gonna borrow it for a bit.
And then we'll return it.

46:53.083 --> 46:54.625
Maybe in slightly worse shape.

46:54.750 --> 46:57.917
After all, we don't want
any of them spying on us.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
This doesn't feel right. You know,

47:00.042 --> 47:01.954
we're already
sort of friends with them.

47:02.154 --> 47:03.787
Will you get a hold of yourself?

47:04.167 --> 47:06.250
Now we're gonna meet here
at ten on the dot.

47:06.417 --> 47:09.792
Then we'll make our way to
their place and grab that Jetbelt.

47:22.167 --> 47:23.083
Lisa!

47:24.292 --> 47:25.250
Over here.

47:25.958 --> 47:27.875
Come give our potatoes a try.

47:28.625 --> 47:30.083
We baked them over the coals,

47:30.167 --> 47:32.083
just like ancient Warriors.

47:33.292 --> 47:34.167
There.

47:34.500 --> 47:36.458
- Careful now, it's hot.
- Got it.

47:36.542 --> 47:38.750
- And you don't have to peel them.
- There you go Kid.

47:38.833 --> 47:40.667
And we'll set the other ones aside.

47:55.542 --> 47:58.000
- I said ten on the dot.
- I know.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.083
But Granny wouldn't fall asleep.

48:18.167 --> 48:20.000
Look! They have a bunny too.

48:31.333 --> 48:32.333
You chump!

48:32.542 --> 48:33.958
It's just a toy.

49:39.792 --> 49:40.792
Hey furball!

49:42.625 --> 49:45.250
- What're you doing down there?
- I got lost.

49:45.792 --> 49:48.125
Last I checked, the attic
was up here.

50:49.167 --> 50:50.667
Good work, Fluffy.

51:10.667 --> 51:13.417
- Hey! Where'd you go?
- I'm up here.

51:14.292 --> 51:17.500
You dope! Next time watch where
you're walkin'. You always...

51:20.833 --> 51:21.625
Not to worry.

51:21.833 --> 51:23.167
We'll get out of this.

51:29.375 --> 51:31.583
- That's the Grandpa.
- We're done for!

51:31.875 --> 51:32.708
We need...

51:33.000 --> 51:34.583
We need to come up with a plan.

51:36.542 --> 51:37.958
Wait wait. I've got it!

51:45.958 --> 51:47.333
A nightingale!

51:57.292 --> 51:59.417
It's putting on quite a show!

51:59.583 --> 52:00.750
Are you out of your mind?

52:00.833 --> 52:02.625
He'll sit there 'til morning!

52:03.917 --> 52:06.167
I can't just cut off the
song halfway through.

52:10.875 --> 52:14.500
Ah! My goodness. I sure would
love to get a look at you.

52:15.208 --> 52:17.750
Stop, stop. He's heading this way.

52:19.125 --> 52:20.667
I scared it off.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.167
Too bad.

52:26.125 --> 52:28.792
Ah well. Guess I'll head off to bed, then.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.833
What do we have here?

52:34.917 --> 52:37.042
Oh dear. Absent minded Alex.

52:37.875 --> 52:39.250
Are you happy now?

52:43.500 --> 52:44.500
What?

52:46.500 --> 52:49.250
Somebody took my fishing rod.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.875
Folks these days!

52:59.875 --> 53:01.333
Now we're trapped.

53:01.792 --> 53:03.708
And they'll catch us in the morning!

53:10.000 --> 53:11.417
They won't catch us.

53:42.625 --> 53:44.250
Not bad at all, Fluffy.

53:44.333 --> 53:46.958
- What's with all the ropes?
- It's Macrame.

53:50.375 --> 53:51.667
Macrame!

53:52.208 --> 53:54.208
Not such a stupid word after all.

53:55.208 --> 53:56.042
Alright.

53:56.833 --> 53:58.833
It's time to get out of here.
Let's go.

54:03.708 --> 54:05.542
Hold on. I've got an idea.

54:05.792 --> 54:06.958
Wait for me here.

54:11.667 --> 54:13.708
Here's your fishing rod, Gramps.

54:17.708 --> 54:19.917
- Why, Smokey?
- Okay, we're off.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.375
- But what'd you do?
- I put a plan in action.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.500
You'll see in the morning.

54:35.417 --> 54:36.583
Now what's your excuse?

54:36.667 --> 54:38.375
Gonna blame it on Granny again?

54:38.625 --> 54:41.375
No, I was waiting for her
to make donuts.

54:41.458 --> 54:42.208
You hungry?

54:42.292 --> 54:43.292
Want a donut?

54:43.958 --> 54:45.708
What do you think, Fluffy?

54:45.792 --> 54:47.375
Yeah, I want a donut.

54:47.542 --> 54:50.000
A do... a do...

54:51.417 --> 54:54.333
Okay, okay, okay.

54:57.333 --> 54:58.875
This is no time for donuts.

54:59.167 --> 55:01.625
It worked! My plan worked!

55:03.292 --> 55:04.417
Can you believe it?

55:04.542 --> 55:06.167
I found my fishing rod!

55:06.417 --> 55:08.458
Yesterday it was gone.

55:09.292 --> 55:11.208
And then suddenly, just...

55:11.625 --> 55:15.542
So I guess I'm off to the river.
I intend to bring back dinner.

55:15.708 --> 55:17.875
You kids behave yourselves.

55:20.917 --> 55:23.083
Yesterday that fishing rod nearly got me.

55:23.208 --> 55:24.833
Someone left it on the roof.

55:24.958 --> 55:27.625
I tripped on it, and darn near
lost one of my lives.

55:27.708 --> 55:29.750
So I tackled it, and
almost broke it in two.

55:29.875 --> 55:31.375
But I chucked it off the roof.

55:31.875 --> 55:33.250
- And then?
- And then...

55:33.417 --> 55:37.125
I sneaked back in and put the
fishing rod right under Grampy's nose.

55:37.250 --> 55:38.958
And he... He took it!

55:39.125 --> 55:42.000
And now, he's gone fishing.

55:42.842 --> 55:43.842
Nah na na na na nah!

55:44.042 --> 55:45.875
Now, time for... Plan B

55:46.500 --> 55:49.417
Alright. Show me your Macrame-me.

55:51.633 --> 55:52.633
Uhuh.

55:52.833 --> 55:53.958
That'll do fine.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.333
And now, time to get ourselves
in some knots.

55:57.292 --> 55:59.333
- Enough jokes. We don't have much time.
- And the donuts?

55:59.417 --> 56:00.750
You and your donuts.

56:00.833 --> 56:01.667
Give 'em here.

56:03.958 --> 56:05.375
Well go on. You take one.

56:05.458 --> 56:06.708
We'll leave the rest here.

56:06.792 --> 56:07.792
They won't go anywhere.

56:07.958 --> 56:10.125
On second thought,
just one more for the road.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.042
I learned how to build a wigwam!

56:29.083 --> 56:30.583
I wonder where they are.

56:53.075 --> 56:54.333
Hi Granny.

56:54.750 --> 56:56.500
No, I'm not that hungry yet.

56:56.708 --> 56:58.208
Yeah, I have the donuts.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.250
Are you out of your bent mind?

57:00.333 --> 57:01.542
Wrap it up.

57:03.333 --> 57:05.625
Uh, Granny? Sorry, I gotta call you back.

57:05.708 --> 57:06.667
Yeah, I will.

57:15.667 --> 57:16.542
So...

57:17.000 --> 57:18.375
First we finish weeding,

57:18.500 --> 57:20.000
and then we should all play with Kid.

57:20.083 --> 57:21.875
Warriors. Or, whatever.

57:22.208 --> 57:24.458
- You got it?
- Or what if you go and play with Kid

57:24.542 --> 57:26.000
and I play with Alex.

57:27.458 --> 57:29.125
- What?
- No, no.

57:29.208 --> 57:30.375
We should play with Kid.

57:30.583 --> 57:33.875
- I think Rosie has the right idea.
- Of course I do.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.917
Yesterday not one of
us played with him.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.833
He was walking all alone,
in the forest.

57:39.833 --> 57:40.875
Don't worry.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.488
Turns out he found himself
some fine company there.

57:43.588 --> 57:44.488
Company?

57:44.542 --> 57:45.750
Well, yeah. Company.

57:45.875 --> 57:47.667
- What's the big deal?
- What kind of company?

57:47.750 --> 57:48.875
No. We should ask him.

57:48.958 --> 57:50.000
Kid, where are you?

57:50.083 --> 57:51.750
- Rosie, don't worry so much.
- Kid!

57:51.833 --> 57:53.083
They're very nice.

57:54.792 --> 57:56.625
- Let them go!
- They're my brothers!

57:56.708 --> 57:58.208
Don't even think about it.

58:00.250 --> 58:01.542
What's going on?

58:01.708 --> 58:02.958
I'm your Queen!

58:03.000 --> 58:06.375
- You untie me right this minute!
- Put a sock in it, Barker!

58:07.875 --> 58:10.667
The time has come for
y'all to pay the piper.

58:10.750 --> 58:12.542
- Pay what?
- Hush!

58:12.625 --> 58:13.917
And don't interrupt me.

58:15.083 --> 58:16.417
What was I sayin'?

58:16.800 --> 58:17.500
Ah!

58:17.500 --> 58:19.292
Okay, so you've gone too far.

58:19.500 --> 58:23.000
And now it's time for you...
to pay the price.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.708
Now don't get excited.

58:25.042 --> 58:27.167
We're not gonna hurt you... much.

58:28.667 --> 58:31.708
But for payment, we are gonna
take somthing off of your hands.

58:32.208 --> 58:34.583
Now where's that famous
Jetbelt of yours?

58:34.750 --> 58:37.375
- Who do you think you are?
- Hold your horses.

58:37.458 --> 58:38.750
I'm the one in charge.

58:38.917 --> 58:40.208
Now where is it?

58:40.917 --> 58:43.458
It's in my laboratory.
In the attic.

58:45.125 --> 58:48.042
Fluffy! Guard the jailbirds!

58:49.000 --> 58:50.418
Alex, how could you?

58:50.618 --> 58:53.287
It's best if they just take it and go.

58:53.667 --> 58:55.958
It's not even real, anyway.

58:56.542 --> 58:57.392
What?

58:57.592 --> 59:00.088
Yeah, I've been trying to
tell you for a while now.

59:00.500 --> 59:02.583
It was a misunderstanding.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
No where could they
have run off to?

59:12.167 --> 59:13.500
What's going on?

59:20.042 --> 59:21.375
But they're my friends!

59:22.875 --> 59:25.833
- Now it's time for you to play our game.
- We're here on a secret mission.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.625
Don't say a word to anyone.

59:28.583 --> 59:31.250
That means... my family's in danger!

01:00:09.175 --> 01:00:10.175
Uhh...

01:00:10.375 --> 01:00:11.792
You doing okay?

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.417
Can I bring you some water?

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:16.792
Alex, as soon as I cut through this rope

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.083
hurl yourself at him

01:00:18.208 --> 01:00:21.042
- and I'll take care of the girls.
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:24.792
But would you mind terribly if
I take that spade?

01:00:25.425 --> 01:00:26.425
Uhh...

01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:27.833
Thanks so much.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.542
You... You don't have to be mean.

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:34.292
- I'm sure we'll untie you in no time.
- What?

01:00:34.375 --> 01:00:36.125
Get over here right now!

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:38.250
Here I come.

01:00:38.583 --> 01:00:41.500
Have you forgotten that
I am your Queen and ruler?

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:44.083
Is this how you treat royalty?
Is it?

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:46.667
Whatever happened to respect, and...

01:00:57.583 --> 01:01:01.458
- So you untie this rope right now!
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:04.333
Lisa, that was brilliant.

01:01:04.708 --> 01:01:07.875
Fluffy! I've got the Jetbelt!

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:12.250
What're you doing?
Have you gone mad?

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:16.500
I don't know.
Maybe I... blacked out?

01:01:16.833 --> 01:01:17.833
Blacked out?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.375
I was gone for five minutes.

01:01:19.667 --> 01:01:21.917
Whatever. Let's check the
gadget and beat it.

01:01:23.833 --> 01:01:27.000
I'm flying!

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.375
Jump a little higher!

01:01:47.792 --> 01:01:49.458
We just want to fly like you did.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:51.042
Stop laughing at me!

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.033
That's... That's just rude.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.000
Yoo-hoo!

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.208
I'm up here!

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:57.042
- Kid!
- Looky what I have here!

01:01:57.125 --> 01:01:59.500
- Kid! Be careful.
- How d'you think you're gonna use the Jetbelt

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:01.750
- when I've got the remote control?
- Kid! Run and hide!

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:03.333
Oh, Kid! You're the best.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:04.750
Come on, toss it here.

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:07.458
Nope. You come get it.

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:20.625
You know what, Rosie?

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:24.375
No, that's not it.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.208
I've been thinking...

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:30.250
And, well, Rosie... here.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:35.458
But it's possible, she won't see me.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:37.917
So then, how will I give
her the flowers?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.333
Stop. Enough.

01:02:39.542 --> 01:02:42.667
You've gotta be decisive. Charming.

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:44.583
And then just say it.

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:46.792
These are for you, Rosie.

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:58.792
Hey, Warrior!

01:02:58.958 --> 01:03:00.542
Where are you?

01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:06.250
Nice try.

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:13.125
Come out, wherever you are.

01:03:19.025 --> 01:03:20.319
Aha!

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300
Hah!

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.833
There you are!

01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:36.000
You wanna play?

01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:39.250
- Okay, Kid.
- Okay then. Catch!

01:03:49.208 --> 01:03:51.083
Meet the self bouncing ball.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.292
- My brother invented it.
- Wait.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:56.250
- Gimme that remote.
- Here it is.

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:01.542
Stop it!

01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:02.458
Turn it off!

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:05.250
And here's the ticking tickler!

01:04:11.542 --> 01:04:14.875
I welcome you,
to my playground!

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:18.625
Where we have, sail car races,

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:20.917
and then a little shower.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.958
Then, to top it off,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.750
we take your picture.

01:04:29.167 --> 01:04:30.500
Okay, I'm off.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:33.000
But you can stay here
and keep on playing.

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:40.458
Come on Kiddo.

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:42.292
I just want the remote control.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:44.583
I've gotcha, now hand it over.

01:04:44.875 --> 01:04:46.792
Nope, I've got <i>you</i>.

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.708
You're holding my brother's
super sticky vest.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.458
Enough!

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.750
You're gonna give me
that remote, right now!

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.250
I'm counting to three.

01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:25.792
One.

01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:29.208
Two.

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.042
Three.

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:33.458
What is that?

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:53.125
- Alex, what <i>is</i> that?
- It's my Exoskeleton.

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:04.042
Oh no!

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.500
Catch!

01:06:29.167 --> 01:06:32.167
My greatest invention!

01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.750
Look what you've done!

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.917
- But he was chasing us.
- Serves you right!

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:42.708
What's happening?

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:47.833
How's it doing that?

01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:49.792
I made sure that each module

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:52.167
had its own individual lithium battery.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:28.792
- Kid! You saved us!
- Max! Alex!

01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:30.833
- We did it!
- Thanks, Kid.

01:07:30.917 --> 01:07:32.083
Yeah!

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:55.216
You okay?

01:07:55.416 --> 01:07:57.316
Yeah, as long as I get away
from those Barkers.

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:08.333
- Kid, you saved the day!
- I'm proud of you, Kid!

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:09.708
You're so awesome!

01:08:09.833 --> 01:08:13.083
- Kid, you're my hero!
- That was some sharp thinkin', little brother.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.125
- A real Warrior.
- We'll play anything you want.

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:23.875
- Rosie!
- It's Tim!

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.917
There's no need to say anything.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:35.917
I know.

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:38.792
I know why you told me about
Bob from school.

01:08:42.332 --> 01:08:43.832
Hey!

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:46.375
Hey Barkers! Where a ya?

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.457
Timothy?

01:08:51.832 --> 01:08:53.792
We were just playing, Grandpa.

01:08:54.841 --> 01:08:55.841
Ahh!

01:08:56.042 --> 01:08:58.792
Well, I ran into our neighbour
over at the lake.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:01.207
She invited me for tea.

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:04.082
As a matter of fact,
she invited all of us.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.667
Eat up, everybody.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.375
Help yourselves.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:12.167
- And where's your grandson?
- He should be here any minute now

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.582
with his little friend.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:16.000
Probably stopped for some ice cream.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.500
Oh.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.875
There they are.

01:09:22.667 --> 01:09:25.707
Meet my grandson, Fluffy.

01:09:25.792 --> 01:09:27.792
And this is our neighbour, Smokey.

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:29.375
He's Ignes' nephew.

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:31.667
Come now, say hello boys.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:36.707
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:50.832
The prototype of my supreme masterpiece!

01:09:51.292 --> 01:09:53.000
Utterly destroyed!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Oh well.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.292
Batteries can't last forever.

01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:19.625
We meant you no harm.

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.792
We just really wanted to
take a ride in your Jetbelt.

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.083
Who cares about flying!

01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:30.667
This Exoskeleton is cooler
than a Jetpack anyday!

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Alex, can you fix it?

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:39.667
- Maybe we could help?
- Please say you'll let us.

01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:42.958
Alex, I think we should.

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.250
Let's go!

01:10:49.167 --> 01:10:51.917
Okay. Let's all be careful now.
Lift 'er up.

01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:10.017
But, what about the donuts?

01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:12.532
Don't worry. They'll be just fine.

01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:14.583
Look how quickly they all made up.

01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:18.417
Here's the thing...

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.267
I used to think,
that if they didn't play with me,

01:11:21.467 --> 01:11:22.767
they didn't love me.

01:11:22.875 --> 01:11:26.625
But now I know that they will
always love me for who I am.

01:11:26.917 --> 01:11:28.167
They're family.

01:11:28.625 --> 01:11:30.292
And that means that..

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.000
It means...

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:35.417
Well, I'm just so lucky to have them.
All of them!

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.375
- My two sisters, and my broth...
- Kid! What're you doing?

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.583
Give me my phone!

01:11:39.667 --> 01:11:41.583
It's time for my livestream.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.708
What's up, friends!

01:11:43.792 --> 01:11:45.417
You can forget about the Jetbelt.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.167
That's so last week.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.375
Today we present

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.208
the one and only, Barker Exoskeleton!
