01:17.203 --> 01:18.871
There's a Mustang '66.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.499
We could turn that into
a '65 with no trouble.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.918
There's a Volkswagen.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.085
Hey.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.004
Hey, let's do
a dune buggy!

01:27.171 --> 01:29.799
Hey, no foreign cars,
huh, man?

01:30.424 --> 01:31.504
<i>There's a Chrysler
imperial.</i>

01:31.550 --> 01:32.760
<i>Look at the fins.</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:33.843
<i>You like it?</i>

01:33.844 --> 01:34.970
<i>I love it.</i>

01:35.429 --> 01:36.262
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:37.097
<i>No way.</i>

01:37.098 --> 01:39.433
<i>O.K., keep your eyes
peeled for a Packard.</i>

01:42.394 --> 01:43.687
<i>You guys want to
do a Camaro?</i>

01:43.854 --> 01:44.939
<i>Whoa.</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:05.291
Don't get me wrong.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.961
I got nothing
against Ford products.

02:07.878 --> 02:08.878
Climb under and tell me

02:09.045 --> 02:10.840
if that cross member's
straight.

02:11.257 --> 02:12.466
Come on. Cut that out.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.135
<i>Yeah, it's straight,</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:15.553
<i>but there's
no Springs.</i>

02:15.719 --> 02:17.930
No! No! Wait!

02:18.097 --> 02:19.723
Dantley,
where you going?

02:19.890 --> 02:20.891
Can't you see?

02:21.058 --> 02:22.935
It's a Corvette!
A stingray!

02:23.144 --> 02:24.353
Hey, stop this machine!

02:24.728 --> 02:25.980
This is it!

02:26.272 --> 02:27.606
We found our car!

02:27.773 --> 02:29.024
Can you believe
your eyes?

02:29.525 --> 02:30.651
It's a Corvette!

02:32.444 --> 02:33.445
Hey!

02:34.363 --> 02:35.573
Hey, mister!

02:36.240 --> 02:37.533
Please stop it!

02:37.992 --> 02:38.992
Stop it!

02:39.577 --> 02:42.246
Stop the crane,
for Christ's sake, will ya?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.672
Wait!

02:52.006 --> 02:53.006
Hey!

02:55.801 --> 02:57.303
Hey, hold it!

02:58.429 --> 02:59.262
Hold it!

02:59.263 --> 03:01.098
Hey, stop the machine!

03:03.851 --> 03:04.894
Hey, somebody...

03:27.791 --> 03:28.918
Easy...

03:29.084 --> 03:30.711
Easy.
Keep it coming.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.087
Keep it coming...

03:32.296 --> 03:33.339
Whoa! Hold it.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.444
Kenny?

03:55.653 --> 03:56.653
Hi, Mom.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.029
What happened?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.323
Did you forget
your key?

03:59.490 --> 04:00.490
Yeah.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.532
Don't you remember?

04:01.533 --> 04:02.573
There's one
in the mailbox.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.953
Uh-oh.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.330
I guess I took it.

04:06.664 --> 04:08.916
I left my key ring
at the lounge.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.668
It's late, isn't it?
What time is it?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.002
Late.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.714
Who you out with
tonight?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.257
Oh...

04:18.759 --> 04:20.552
That's Mr. Borodino.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.221
He's in real estate.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.930
Why?

04:23.931 --> 04:24.931
I don't know.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.434
Thought I heard
his water pump going.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.978
He ought to look
at that.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.437
Got the key?

04:30.896 --> 04:31.896
Have fun
tonight?

04:32.022 --> 04:33.315
<i>Did you have
a date?</i>

04:33.774 --> 04:34.774
Not really.

04:37.903 --> 04:38.903
<i>Say...</i>

04:39.822 --> 04:41.532
Aren't you going to
give me a kiss, huh?

04:42.324 --> 04:43.241
Come on.

04:43.242 --> 04:44.535
Give your old mother
a kiss.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.412
I haven't seen you
all day.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.210
<i>Hi, Bernie.</i>

04:54.586 --> 04:56.297
<i>Naw,
it's not late.</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:57.881
<i>Come on over.</i>

05:13.522 --> 05:15.274
<i>Dave?
It's Ed McGrath.</i>

05:15.733 --> 05:17.693
<i>Yes, I am passing
the hat again,</i>

05:18.861 --> 05:19.879
<i>only this time,
I was wondering</i>

05:19.903 --> 05:23.532
<i>if you folks could contribute
a set of bf GTAs.</i>

05:24.616 --> 05:26.535
Yeah, I know, but it's
for a good cause...

05:27.036 --> 05:29.330
I'm pleased to see
my efforts this past quarter

05:29.496 --> 05:31.332
haven't entirely
been in vain.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.543

Hey, Mr. McGrath.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.889
You a dance monitor?

08:34.556 --> 08:35.472
You look like
something off

08:35.474 --> 08:36.474
<i>the Lawrence Welk show.</i>

08:36.517 --> 08:38.644
Knock it off, Ken.
I'm enjoying myself.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.563
What are you doing
in here, anyway?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.150
I don't know.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.818
I was thinking,

08:47.819 --> 08:50.113
maybe we should've
lowered that spoiler,

08:50.531 --> 08:53.825
maybe even gone for
a wing or a fastback.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.078
What are you giving me?
It's perfect.

08:56.245 --> 08:57.663
Be proud of it.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.749
Yeah, you're right.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.835
It is perfect.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.380
Listen, Dantley...

09:07.297 --> 09:08.882
Don't you go bad on me.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.217
I don't want to read

you're sticking up

better in your classes.

the difference?

09:21.478 --> 09:22.478
I'm out, aren't I?

09:22.938 --> 09:24.523
O.K., comedian.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.066
You joke about it.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.987
But I had high hopes.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.781
Better attitude,
better grades...

09:33.907 --> 09:35.227
Couple of years

09:36.535 --> 09:38.704

break them, fix them...

10:07.899 --> 10:08.899

I bet he slopped the
drinks on the seat

14:25.657 --> 14:27.742
and he's too scared
to face us.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.672
Come in, Kootz.
Come in, Kootz.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.716
Stingray,
do you read me?

14:45.051 --> 14:46.177
There he is!

14:46.344 --> 14:47.888
No, that's not him.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.265
<i>Oh, yes, it is.</i>

14:59.316 --> 15:02.027
You said to get cokes.
They're right here.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.570
The keys are in my pocket.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.239
I was only in there
a minute.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.533
They never started it.
I would have heard.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.035
They must've
towed it.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.786
Are you towing
cars tonight?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.830
No, and this is
legal parking.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.749
<i>Did you leave
it running?</i>

15:15.916 --> 15:18.460
<i>Of course I didn't.
The keys are right here.</i>

15:18.627 --> 15:20.378
<i>You said get cokes.</i>

15:23.048 --> 15:24.841
I didn't want
no cokes.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.968
Who said
I was thirsty?

15:28.345 --> 15:29.930
I want my car.

15:30.722 --> 15:31.722
Kootz...

15:32.891 --> 15:34.476
You little shit,
you lost it!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.901
Dantley, don't we have
enough trouble here?

15:43.902 --> 15:44.902
Don't worry, son.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.196
We'll get
your car back.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.823
Unfortunately,
your car was a Corvette.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.868
They are the favorite target
of your professional car ring...

15:52.160 --> 15:54.788
Corvette, Porsche,
'67 Impala,

15:54.955 --> 15:57.040
Buick Riviera,
Dune buggies...

15:57.207 --> 15:58.875
and now they're
getting into your RVS.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.794
What about
your Toronado?

16:00.961 --> 16:02.420
Oh, that's right, sir.

16:02.837 --> 16:04.881
Your principal's car
was taken two years ago,

16:05.048 --> 16:06.257
<i>and it was
never recovered.</i>

16:06.967 --> 16:07.967
<i>Frankly,</i>

16:08.009 --> 16:11.262
<i>we feel there's a ring
working right in this area.</i>

16:11.596 --> 16:13.682
<i>No matter what you've
heard in math class,</i>

16:13.932 --> 16:16.893
<i>some things are worth more
than the sum of their parts.</i>

16:17.060 --> 16:18.103
<i>Stingray front clip...</i>

16:18.269 --> 16:20.814
<i>we're talking about
$750 right there.</i>

16:21.481 --> 16:23.191
<i>No, I'm sorry to say so,</i>

16:23.483 --> 16:25.110
<i>but that's it
for your machine.</i>

16:25.443 --> 16:27.612
<i>It's out of state,
and it's in pieces.</i>

16:28.405 --> 16:30.281
<i>I understand
you have insurance.</i>

16:30.991 --> 16:32.075
That's it?

16:33.118 --> 16:35.829
It's a kiss-off,
after all the work we did?

16:35.996 --> 16:37.497
You ought to be out looking.

16:37.664 --> 16:38.957
Sit down, Dantley.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.090
Look, I know
how you feel.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.925
<i>Might as well
resign yourselves.</i>

16:49.092 --> 16:50.844
<i>You'll never see
that car again.</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:53.013
No one's going to
break that car up.

16:54.055 --> 16:56.599
I don't buy that
"sum of the parts" crap.

16:56.766 --> 16:57.766
You guys have seen...

16:57.892 --> 16:58.995
it's the best-looking
street machine

16:59.019 --> 17:00.562
on the west coast.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.358
No one's going to
lay a finger on it.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.451
Fill 'er up?

17:15.535 --> 17:16.535
Nope.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.248
Gonna fill you up.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.500
Promise 'em anything...

17:24.252 --> 17:25.377
But give 'em Arpege.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.796
Oh.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.548
Here you go.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.115
Yeah.

18:00.914 --> 18:01.914
Yeah.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.291
Beg your pardon?

18:03.458 --> 18:04.876
I sure as hell have.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.043
Have what?

18:06.169 --> 18:07.044
Kid...

18:07.045 --> 18:08.797
This car is
in Las Vegas.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.442
What are you talking about?
You've seen it?

18:11.466 --> 18:12.509
Sure, I saw it.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.761
It was in one of
those big casinos

18:14.928 --> 18:16.721
on a mirror
going round.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.264
It's on display.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.264
Where?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.265
Yeah...

18:20.600 --> 18:21.768
Where?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.020
Hell,
I can't remember.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.523
I was with a client
on the strip.

18:26.689 --> 18:27.689
Wait, wait.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.442
This was a Corvette,
right?

18:29.609 --> 18:30.609
Candy-apple?

18:30.735 --> 18:32.821
Candy-apple
metal flake.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.782
Superior mags, Mercury
tubes, Gabriel shocks?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.451
Kid, this is the car
you're looking for, right?

18:38.660 --> 18:39.535
Yeah.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.662
This is the car
I saw.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.294
Hey, where you
going, Las Vegas?

19:29.627 --> 19:30.544
Yeah.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.922
Far out. We take you the
whole way. Jump in.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.148
Wow...

19:50.732 --> 19:53.526
What's this supposed
to be, anyway, a hearse?

19:53.776 --> 19:55.445
You don't like cars?

19:55.737 --> 19:57.989
Sure, I like cars.
I... I love 'em.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.283
Yeah, you like cars.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.869
What kind of ride you like,
charger, Camaro?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.453
Nah.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.747
<i>Corvette, huh?</i>

20:09.459 --> 20:11.002
Yeah. You got it.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.838
Sure, I got it.
Corvette, Anglo.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.423
Anglo, Corvette.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.050
What's wrong
with a Corvette?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.593
It's all gm.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.095
What's gm
have to do with it?

20:25.975 --> 20:27.185
Excuse me, uh...

20:27.810 --> 20:29.562
17 miles an hour?

20:29.729 --> 20:30.772
15.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.775
<i>On the interstate? You looking
for a contact lens?</i>

20:33.942 --> 20:36.402
<i>Ha. You paddies
crack me up.</i>

20:36.569 --> 20:37.987
<i>Still doing
your speed, huh?</i>

20:38.154 --> 20:40.114
What are you into,
miles per gallon?

20:40.281 --> 20:43.117
Class.
We're into class.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.746
O.K. I got to
get out now.

20:46.913 --> 20:47.913
No.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.375
We're going to
<i>Los Huevos,</i> remember?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.085
Friend,
just let me out.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.753
You don't even
have to stop.

21:00.510 --> 21:01.970
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

21:55.064 --> 21:56.941
Oh. Wait a minute.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.318
Huh?

21:58.693 --> 21:59.777
Thanks for
picking me up.

21:59.944 --> 22:00.944
Oh, yeah.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.655
I <i>thought</i> you were
hitchhiking,

22:02.822 --> 22:04.490
only you didn't have
your thumb out.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.658
You wanna hitchhike,

22:05.825 --> 22:07.410
you gotta stick
something out.

22:08.119 --> 22:09.162
Where you from?

22:10.830 --> 22:11.998
Newhall.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.167
You go to
MacArthur High?

22:16.419 --> 22:17.837
Yeah.
I just graduated.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.172
No kidding.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.965
I go to
San Fernando.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.132
Huh.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.843
What are you going
to Vegas for?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.013
I'm looking for my car.

22:27.638 --> 22:28.973
Somebody stole
my stingray.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.808
Word's out
it's in Vegas.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.811
<i>You've</i> got
a Corvette?

22:34.771 --> 22:35.771
Oh, sure.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.149
Nice Van you got here.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.317
Yeah, really,

22:39.484 --> 22:41.235
but you can't tell
from up front.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.489
Go on back and,
uh, check it out.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.371
Nice.

22:52.997 --> 22:53.998
Who did the work?

22:54.290 --> 22:56.000
Some friends of mine...

22:56.167 --> 23:00.588
You know, in exchange
for services rendered.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.006
Services?

23:02.340 --> 23:03.674
What kind
of services?

23:03.841 --> 23:05.176
You know
what I mean.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.887
Hey, bring up
a couple cold ones.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.555
We'll talk about it.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.056
So...

23:11.557 --> 23:13.601
What are you going
to Vegas for, a summer job?

23:14.143 --> 23:15.143
Uh-uh.

23:15.144 --> 23:18.606
Full-time, sugar,
from now on.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.568
Hey, how old
are you?

23:23.027 --> 23:24.487
You know what
I'm talking about.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.739
You've met girls
like me.

23:27.782 --> 23:28.825
I guess.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.870
I'm a hooker,
for Christ's sake.

23:33.704 --> 23:34.831
A what?

23:35.206 --> 23:37.083
What, you mean
like a prostitute?

23:37.458 --> 23:40.962
Well, you know, like
a trainee, anyway.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.421
I mean,
there comes a time

23:42.505 --> 23:44.966
when every
amateur goes pro.

24:04.152 --> 24:05.152
Take it!

24:06.362 --> 24:07.738
What are you doing?

24:08.489 --> 24:10.116
I got to get ready.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.243
<i>I'm pulling over.</i>

24:25.631 --> 24:28.551
Ho-ly smoke.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.303
Hi.

24:30.553 --> 24:31.804
Yeah. Hi.

24:32.597 --> 24:33.639
Tell you what.

24:33.973 --> 24:37.727
You can be
my first customer.

24:38.769 --> 24:39.769
Oh...

24:40.021 --> 24:41.898
Boy, you got to
be kidding.

24:42.356 --> 24:43.356
No.

24:43.399 --> 24:44.442
No, I'm not.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.027
What do you think
I'm worth?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.488
Oh, I... I... I
wouldn't know that.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.699
Check it out.
Look what I got here.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.993
Name a figure.
Make me an offer.

24:55.786 --> 24:57.205
$15?

24:57.413 --> 25:00.875
$15? What you think I am,
an old prune?

25:01.042 --> 25:03.002
Wait a minute.
What did you just say?

25:03.252 --> 25:06.130
Did you just say
15 or 50?

25:06.672 --> 25:08.883
50! Oh, I said 50.

25:09.217 --> 25:10.718
That's what I said.
50.

25:11.302 --> 25:12.302
That's more like it.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.639
You got yourself a deal.
Let's jump in the back.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.266
I wasn't
making a bid.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.893
I know. I know.

25:19.060 --> 25:22.271
You never paid for it
before in your life.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.023
But then again...

25:25.107 --> 25:26.984
You never had me.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.820
Look, this is my stop.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.447
Really nice
riding with you,

25:31.656 --> 25:33.366
but will you hand me
my gear, please?

25:33.533 --> 25:35.952
Don't be like that.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.120
O.K. Come on.

25:38.788 --> 25:39.788
Here's the thing.

25:39.914 --> 25:40.789
I didn't want to...

25:40.790 --> 25:41.916
give me my gear!

25:44.126 --> 25:46.754
My final offer. $20.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.673
Maybe some other time.

25:50.341 --> 25:53.135
Hey, wait.
What's your name, anyway?

25:53.344 --> 25:55.012
You can read,
can't you?

25:57.098 --> 25:58.849
"Van... essa."

26:35.595 --> 26:36.804
Excuse me, uh, sir?

26:36.971 --> 26:38.014
Yes, sir?

26:38.723 --> 26:39.723
A room?

26:39.932 --> 26:40.932
A name, please?

26:40.975 --> 26:42.101
N-no. No room.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.311
I'm looking
for a car.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.979
The garage
is one floor down.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.187
Elevator to your right.

26:47.064 --> 26:48.608
No. No, wait. See,

26:49.066 --> 26:51.777
you got a car in
the lobby on a mirror?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.613
We sure don't, sir.
Yes, sir?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.114
Thank you.

26:55.573 --> 26:56.616
Excuse me.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.620
Please, sir, it's
a stingray, a '73.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.455
Yes, I heard.
A car on a mirror.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.707
That's one thing
we don't have.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.477
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.021
You look like a winner.
You really do.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.440
I got something
I'd like you to see.

27:29.607 --> 27:30.983
Just something
right here.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.277
Huh? Come here.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.321
My friend and I,

27:35.488 --> 27:36.906
we're a little
short on cash.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.324
You got 70 bucks
on you?

27:38.491 --> 27:41.077
Hey, most of these
are real diamonds.

27:41.827 --> 27:42.827
Well, I...

27:42.995 --> 27:44.914
hey, 100 bucks.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.666
You gonna say no
to a Bulova?

27:46.957 --> 27:48.918
I'm from out of town.
I don't want anything.

27:49.085 --> 27:51.545
All right, I gotcha.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.214
We'll catch you
later, champ.

27:59.804 --> 28:00.804
Excuse me, sir?

28:00.888 --> 28:01.888
Yes, sir.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.808
I know
this sounds crazy,

28:03.974 --> 28:05.976
but you don't have
a car in there, do you?

28:06.143 --> 28:08.521
Inside to your left,
near the lounge.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.440
I'm talking about
a full-sized automobile.

28:11.774 --> 28:12.732
Call it what you want.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.443
It's just
a goddamn Hotrod.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.526
A Datsun?

28:56.569 --> 28:57.945
It's a Datsun!

29:00.156 --> 29:00.989
Yeah, I know.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.367
You'd think they'd at
least have a Cadillac.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.412
I was told
it was a Corvette.

29:06.996 --> 29:08.789
Don't take it
so hard.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.250
Why don't we try
someplace else?

29:17.631 --> 29:18.924
$4.80.

29:21.594 --> 29:22.845
Good god.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.889
My wallet's gone.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.143
"Most of them
are real diamonds."

29:30.186 --> 29:31.866
What'd you have in mind,
double or nothing?

29:32.021 --> 29:34.690
I got to eat. Let me
wash dishes for it.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.984
It's all paper.
Beat it!

29:37.151 --> 29:38.319
Give the kid his food!

29:38.903 --> 29:40.029
Are you good for it?

29:40.738 --> 29:42.948
I'm not only
good for it,

29:43.115 --> 29:44.283
I'll make it
interesting.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.660
How about 4 to 1?
How about 10 to 1?

29:46.827 --> 29:47.995
Huh? Huh?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.127
Heads.

29:58.172 --> 29:59.465
I love it!

30:00.049 --> 30:01.049
Go ahead, kid.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.053
What's the catch?

30:04.386 --> 30:05.513
There's no catch.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.265
Boy, are you dirty.

30:09.225 --> 30:11.060
Hey, just call me
Gladstone duck.

30:11.227 --> 30:12.436
It is
the damnedest thing.

30:12.603 --> 30:13.979
I cannot lose
for trying.

30:14.188 --> 30:17.817
I been in this town
18 hours. I made $18,000.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.583
I've heard of it
happening to other guys,

30:19.610 --> 30:21.362
but to think
it could happen to me...

30:22.947 --> 30:24.448
Makes you believe
in the almighty.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.911
Well, it's time for me
to go, and I know it.

30:29.078 --> 30:30.358
Let me give you
some advice, kid.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.206
Quit while you're ahead.
Get out of Vegas.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.543
You're not going to
Los Angeles, by any chance.

30:35.709 --> 30:39.004
No. I'm going to run
this baby back to Avis

30:39.171 --> 30:40.651
and catch the first
plane to Portland.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.925
O.K. See ya.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.260
Hey, kid.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.221
You're in a bad way.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.337
I tell you what
I'm going to do.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.350
I'm going to pass my
lucky streak on to you.

30:53.853 --> 30:54.937
Here.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.023
A $2.00 bill?

30:58.566 --> 31:00.192
That's what
I started with.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.259
Morning.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.356
Climb in. Hi.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.900
Hey, hey!

32:29.365 --> 32:30.365
Wait!

32:38.999 --> 32:40.376
Hey! Stop!

32:56.976 --> 32:57.976
Wait!

33:46.442 --> 33:48.360
Hey. That's quite a car.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.998
We shouldn't have
any trouble picking it up.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.531
You got a license number?

33:52.948 --> 33:53.781
No problem.

33:53.782 --> 33:54.942
One-of-a-kind.
Totally unique.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.910
I'm sure it is
to your eyes,

33:57.161 --> 33:59.496
but there's a lot
of fancy cars here.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.331
Are you positive
you weren't running after

34:01.498 --> 34:02.578
somebody else's automobile?

34:02.666 --> 34:04.626
No way. Look.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.422
See what I did with
the steering wheel?

34:08.589 --> 34:09.840
Yeah, what about it?

34:10.007 --> 34:11.382
It's right-hand drive.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.469
Ha! So it is.

34:13.677 --> 34:14.678
What do you know?

34:15.679 --> 34:18.139
Maybe you can let me
ride with a patrolman.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.184
I could really
help spot it.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.061
The Las Vegas
police department

34:22.226 --> 34:24.188
is one of the finest
in the country.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.688
We can handle it.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.150
<i>Dear Mr. McGrath,</i>

34:28.442 --> 34:32.446
<i>I've tracked the Corvette
to Las Vegas, Nevada.</i>

34:32.821 --> 34:34.864
<i>It's here.
I saw it.</i>

34:35.657 --> 34:38.118
<i>Someone probably won it
in a card game.</i>

34:39.244 --> 34:40.954
<i>Bet you 4 to 1
I find it.</i>

34:41.288 --> 34:42.331
<i>Get it?</i>

34:42.790 --> 34:43.956
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

34:44.541 --> 34:45.667
<i>I won't gamble.</i>

34:45.833 --> 34:47.418
<i>I don't have
the money for it.</i>

34:48.212 --> 34:49.505
<i>Goodbye for now.</i>

34:49.797 --> 34:51.422
<i>Sincerely,</i>

34:52.091 --> 34:53.300
<i>Kenny Dantley.</i>

35:00.140 --> 35:04.770
<i>P.S. Lots of incredible
cars here.</i>

35:44.393 --> 35:45.811
Shit.

35:47.271 --> 35:48.438
Goddamn it.

35:48.939 --> 35:49.939
Hi.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.026
Jesus Christ.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.112
Sorry I scared you.

35:55.279 --> 35:56.989
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

36:04.204 --> 36:05.664
Oh, yeah.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.792
Love your shawl.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.336
The men's room's open.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.672
Do I look like a man?

36:13.964 --> 36:15.465
Who's gonna
bother you?

36:52.419 --> 36:54.713
<i>What are you
doing here, anyway?</i>

36:54.880 --> 36:56.673
I got a place nearby.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.008
Rent's right.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.053
Oh, you're sleeping
in a u-haul, huh?

37:01.637 --> 37:02.638
Forget it.

37:03.096 --> 37:06.225
<i>Get in my Van and make
yourself comfortable.</i>

37:06.808 --> 37:08.477
I'm all right
where I am.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.229
How you doing?

37:10.479 --> 37:12.606
<i>Life on the street
kind of rough, huh?</i>

37:13.065 --> 37:14.650
I seen rougher.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.320
I just got started on
the wrong foot, that's all.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.155
Blue jeans.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.532
Kiss of death.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.621
<i>You ever seen those
$100 models work the hotels?</i>

37:27.788 --> 37:28.956
<i>See the way they dress,</i>

37:29.248 --> 37:30.749
<i>how they look?</i>

37:31.166 --> 37:33.085
You look cheap,
you are cheap,

37:33.252 --> 37:35.921
and it's all downhill
from there.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.423
No, I gotta get me
an outfit.

37:38.799 --> 37:39.800
You know?

37:40.133 --> 37:41.843
Something sophisticated.

37:42.219 --> 37:45.472
Black velvet with
a little choker ribbon.

37:52.729 --> 37:55.482
So what are you doing
out here freezing to death?

37:55.983 --> 37:56.983
Hmm?

37:57.734 --> 37:59.486
Get in the Van.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.739
There's food
in the fridge.

38:29.599 --> 38:32.436
How do you like
that ocean motion?

38:34.646 --> 38:37.024
Oh, it's great.
Really great.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.276
You know, uh,

38:39.985 --> 38:42.404
I hear some people
keep fish in them.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.657
You got a girlfriend?

38:46.116 --> 38:48.618
No. No.
Well, no one special.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.287
You ever go out?

38:50.454 --> 38:51.788
Yeah, sure.

38:53.874 --> 38:56.043
Anybody ever tell you
you're cute?

38:57.336 --> 38:58.628
Well, you are.

39:03.592 --> 39:04.760
Hey...

39:06.303 --> 39:08.347
You know what I got on
under here?

39:09.639 --> 39:10.932
Paper towels?

39:12.851 --> 39:13.977
Nothin'.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.271
My streaker suit.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.399
If you're going
to spend the night,

39:20.859 --> 39:22.694
you're going to
spend it with me.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.404
<i>Comprende, amigo?</i>

39:24.905 --> 39:28.116
Oh, uh, sure.
You know, I-I'm cool.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.829
So... peel off
them duds, sailor,

39:32.996 --> 39:34.623
and let me see
what you got.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.461
Fine. Fine.

39:40.253 --> 39:43.590
Do, uh, do you mind
if I close the curtains?

39:43.882 --> 39:44.925
Go ahead.

39:48.512 --> 39:49.554
O.K.

39:50.764 --> 39:51.807
Got it.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.558
There's one.

40:08.115 --> 40:09.115
Here.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.283
Take my towel,
would you,

40:11.368 --> 40:12.953
and hang it
on something.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.253
O.K. Yeah.

40:31.972 --> 40:32.972
Are you O.K.?

40:33.223 --> 40:36.268
Oh, yeah. I just...
Got a little knot

40:36.435 --> 40:38.770
in one of my shoelaces.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.606
Just do a little...

40:42.482 --> 40:44.359
Wait a minute.

40:46.987 --> 40:50.115
This is a real honor.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.576
What do you mean?

40:54.161 --> 40:57.122
I'm going to be
your first woman.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.000
Oh, no. No, no.

41:00.167 --> 41:02.252
Hey, I've been
through this a lot.

41:02.419 --> 41:03.920
A whole lot.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.130
No, you haven't.

41:05.338 --> 41:06.506
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

41:06.673 --> 41:08.049
Come here.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.469
Mama help.

41:11.845 --> 41:15.056
I know just
how you feel.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.435
As a matter of fact,

41:19.603 --> 41:21.438
there are
a lot of moves

41:21.771 --> 41:23.940
that I haven't
tried yet.

41:25.275 --> 41:26.401
Moves?

41:27.110 --> 41:28.110
Yeah.

41:28.236 --> 41:29.529
Maneuvers...

41:30.113 --> 41:32.282
Which are going to be
very important

41:32.449 --> 41:33.992
in my line of work.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.577
You don't mind, do you?

41:36.953 --> 41:39.206
Hey.
Where are you going?

41:39.498 --> 41:40.624
Oh, nowhere.

41:40.790 --> 41:42.751
I just thought things
might work out better

41:42.918 --> 41:43.960
if I slept over here.

41:44.127 --> 41:47.589
<i>This sure is warmer
than that old u-haul.</i>

41:49.424 --> 41:51.134
Are you putting me on?

41:52.677 --> 41:54.262
Oh, no. No, no, no.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.641
It's just...
I got to get some sleep.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.018
I'm really out
on my feet.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.898
<i>Hey, come on.
What are you doing?</i>

42:05.065 --> 42:07.692
<i>Nothing. Where's
your wallet, anyway?</i>

42:07.901 --> 42:10.362
<i>Let go of that, and
stay out of my pockets!</i>

42:10.529 --> 42:13.615
<i>Look, we got to have
some rules around here.</i>

42:13.782 --> 42:16.201
<i>You spend the night,
you get charged!</i>

42:16.785 --> 42:18.161
<i>I never laid a hand
on you!</i>

42:18.328 --> 42:21.540
<i>I don't care! You've
got a lot of nerve.</i>

42:21.706 --> 42:23.124
<i>What are you so mad at?</i>

42:23.291 --> 42:25.627
<i>You had your chance.
That'll be 20 bucks!</i>

42:25.794 --> 42:27.128
<i>Stop the hooker stuff!</i>

42:27.295 --> 42:29.422
<i>Cough it up! You spent
the whole night!</i>

42:29.589 --> 42:30.590
<i>It ought to be 40!</i>

42:30.757 --> 42:32.551
No way! I didn't do anything!

42:32.759 --> 42:33.759
You stink!

42:34.302 --> 42:36.137
Boy, do I
need a pimp!

42:36.304 --> 42:39.766
Everything I got
I give to you!

42:40.433 --> 42:42.978
<i>Full payment
for services rendered!</i>

42:43.228 --> 42:46.398
Oh! I hate you!

42:47.649 --> 42:48.984
Oh, yeah?

42:52.362 --> 42:53.613
That's telling her, kid.

42:54.698 --> 42:55.740
What do you want?

42:56.408 --> 42:57.867
This is my gas station.

42:58.702 --> 42:59.744
I like your style.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.333
You ever pumped gas?

43:09.671 --> 43:10.671
Quiet down.

43:35.530 --> 43:36.698
It's me.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.076
I was just
going over my mail.

43:41.328 --> 43:43.455
I got a postcard here
from Kenny Dantley.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.416
He's in Las Vegas.

43:49.711 --> 43:50.795
That's the idea.

43:53.006 --> 43:54.591
Looks just like
a new one, don't it?

43:55.258 --> 43:57.761
You know something, kid?
You catch on fast.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.094
As of today,

43:59.179 --> 44:00.972
I am promoting you
to salesman.

44:03.058 --> 44:05.644
I have just seen
your first needy motorist.

44:06.936 --> 44:08.188
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

44:09.189 --> 44:10.315
Take these...

44:11.524 --> 44:13.777
And drop them
in her battery.

44:14.194 --> 44:15.027
What?

44:15.028 --> 44:16.321
Alka seltzer.

44:16.488 --> 44:17.404
Yeah.

44:17.405 --> 44:18.448
Plop plop.

44:18.615 --> 44:19.949
Fizz fizz?

44:20.575 --> 44:21.575
Can you handle it?

44:23.036 --> 44:23.952
Yeah. Sure.

44:32.671 --> 44:33.671
Fill her up?

44:33.755 --> 44:35.090
Yes, please.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.802
And may I check
under your hood, ma'am?

44:41.721 --> 44:43.431
And, uh,

44:43.765 --> 44:45.892
what, shall I look
under your hood?

44:46.393 --> 44:47.393
Yeah. O.K.

44:51.356 --> 44:53.775
Uh-oh.
What have we here?

44:54.234 --> 44:55.234
Foam.

44:56.778 --> 44:57.987
Battery problems.

44:58.196 --> 44:59.489
<i>Are you traveling far?</i>

45:00.824 --> 45:02.283
<i>Across the desert.</i>

45:02.659 --> 45:05.370
Well, fortunately for you,

45:06.162 --> 45:11.459
we have a special sale
on new batteries.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.670
Say, Gil,
I was wondering...

45:13.837 --> 45:15.338
you're doing great, kid.
Now, listen.

45:15.505 --> 45:17.132
I want you to cut
her fan belt.

45:17.298 --> 45:18.508
This is my magic ring.

45:19.592 --> 45:20.719
Just a flick, a snip.

45:22.137 --> 45:23.138
Just a Nick, that's all.

45:23.304 --> 45:24.514
Here. Take this battery.

45:24.806 --> 45:27.225
<i>She doesn't have
any cash.</i>

45:27.392 --> 45:29.018
<i>She lost it all
playing Blackjack.</i>

45:29.185 --> 45:30.395
That's what
they all say!

45:30.562 --> 45:34.733
She can't pay for the gas.
Her credit card's expired.

45:37.152 --> 45:38.152
Hey!

45:38.194 --> 45:39.194
<i>Stop!</i>

45:39.612 --> 45:41.364
Stop! Crook!

45:41.573 --> 45:44.075
Maybe we could
mail her the bill.

45:46.536 --> 45:47.954
Hello, cheapskate.

45:48.121 --> 45:49.121
Hi.

45:49.122 --> 45:50.957
Looks like I lost
a quart of Quaker State,

45:51.124 --> 45:52.417
two sets
of wiper blades...

45:52.584 --> 45:54.586
I got some hot news.
Get in.

45:54.753 --> 45:56.087
<i>Where's my STP?</i>

45:56.379 --> 45:58.506
They even took
my credit card machine!

45:58.882 --> 45:59.924
And my anteater.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.217
<i>Dantley, you're
in trouble!</i>

46:01.384 --> 46:03.052
I'm working now.
I'll see you.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.805
The job can wait.
It's important. Get in.

46:06.639 --> 46:07.514
Can I maybe...

46:07.515 --> 46:08.975
Oh, no, you don't,
Dantley.

46:09.142 --> 46:09.975
You're
working overtime

46:09.976 --> 46:11.895
because this is
all your fault.

46:12.145 --> 46:13.145
Don't listen to him.

46:13.188 --> 46:15.023
He can take a ride
if he wants to.

46:15.190 --> 46:16.983
Are you running
a prison farm?

46:17.525 --> 46:18.525
<i>Vámonos.</i>

46:18.985 --> 46:20.153
So, what's
the hot news?

46:20.737 --> 46:21.821
You're unemployed.

46:22.155 --> 46:23.448
Very funny.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.367
What are you supposed
to be now, a nurse?

46:26.534 --> 46:29.788
A beautician. I got a job in a
hotel beauty shop.

46:29.954 --> 46:31.831
Did you notice
I frosted my tips?

46:31.998 --> 46:32.998
It's neat, huh?

46:33.124 --> 46:35.752
Wonderful. Is that
what you came to tell me?

46:35.919 --> 46:37.921
I lost a job because
you frosted your tips?

46:38.213 --> 46:39.964
Take it easy.

46:40.673 --> 46:41.548
What about
the hooker number?

46:41.549 --> 46:42.549
What happened to that?

46:42.592 --> 46:44.803
Nothing.
This just gives me

46:44.969 --> 46:46.638
a chance to get
my act together.

46:46.805 --> 46:48.473
Hey, can I tell you something?

46:48.640 --> 46:50.642
You're never going
to be a prostitute.

46:51.142 --> 46:53.019
You haven't
got it in you.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.396
You're right.

46:56.147 --> 46:57.147
You're right.

46:57.273 --> 46:58.775
As a matter of fact,

46:59.234 --> 47:02.821
there are no prostitutes
in Las Vegas.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.156
Look at this.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.450
"Good company escorts..."
oh, god.

47:07.951 --> 47:09.911
What do you think
of the name Rosalind?

47:10.161 --> 47:12.288
Rosalind? What's wrong
with Vanessa?

47:12.455 --> 47:14.249
First of all,
it's not my name.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.668
My real name's Eleanor.

47:17.126 --> 47:18.419
Eleanor?

47:18.586 --> 47:20.171
Second of all,
I'm not sure

47:20.338 --> 47:22.632
that Vanessa's got
the right tone to it.

47:22.799 --> 47:24.884
It might be
a mistake for me.

47:26.261 --> 47:27.595
Rosalind.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.683
Oh, no!

47:34.519 --> 47:35.519
Hey!

47:35.770 --> 47:37.230
That's my car!

47:49.033 --> 47:50.285
How about a lift?

47:52.662 --> 47:53.872
Come on in.

48:00.753 --> 48:02.297
There he is. Tromp it!

48:11.598 --> 48:13.600
What the...
are you out of your mind?

48:13.766 --> 48:15.351
Kenny, it's a red light!

48:15.518 --> 48:17.478
Go through it.
That's my car!

48:17.645 --> 48:19.355
I can't move!
It's illegal!

48:19.522 --> 48:21.900
What do you call
auto theft?

48:22.108 --> 48:23.735
Sit down and shut up.

48:23.902 --> 48:24.902
Don't be such a...

48:24.986 --> 48:26.946
Oh, god.
God, we're losing him!

48:28.281 --> 48:29.281
Ow!

48:29.324 --> 48:31.618
Kenny, c-o-p,
c-o-p.

48:33.995 --> 48:34.995
Oh, perfect!

48:35.038 --> 48:37.165
That's a stolen car!

48:37.332 --> 48:38.666
What's the problem here?

48:38.833 --> 48:41.085
You, uh, take
the wrong pill this morning?

48:42.128 --> 48:44.005
This is what
I'm talking about.

48:44.172 --> 48:46.299
We still got
a good chance.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.468
This Dodge has the
performance package, right?

48:50.219 --> 48:52.055
Are you
kidding me?

48:52.597 --> 48:54.223
It's not even
his car.

48:54.390 --> 48:56.017
It belongs
to the school.

48:56.184 --> 48:57.602
What a nut!

48:57.977 --> 49:00.605
It's not even your car!

49:00.772 --> 49:02.523
So what? I built it.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.609
Can we discuss this
after we catch him?

49:04.901 --> 49:05.985
Slow down, friend.

49:06.402 --> 49:08.655
Radio... even faster
than rubber.

49:09.030 --> 49:10.531
You did get the license
number, right?

49:11.282 --> 49:12.533
License number?

49:13.201 --> 49:14.827
Right. It was, uh...

49:14.994 --> 49:16.329
It was, uh...

49:17.622 --> 49:18.622
Oh, god.

49:19.248 --> 49:20.249
Nevada.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.752
P-r-b-2-3.

49:22.919 --> 49:24.087
<i>Thank you, miss.</i>

49:26.506 --> 49:27.866
<i>On your vehicle
I.D. Check,</i>

49:28.424 --> 49:30.927
<i>stolen Nevada p-r-b-2-3,</i>

49:31.302 --> 49:33.513
<i>we show no such
Nevada registration.</i>

49:33.763 --> 49:36.766
<i>Repeat. No such
Nevada registration.</i>

49:39.644 --> 49:41.229
It's a forgery.

49:42.605 --> 49:43.940
They forged it.

49:48.528 --> 49:50.154
<i>Dear Mr. McGrath,</i>

49:50.363 --> 49:52.156
<i>I saw the car again,</i>

49:52.323 --> 49:55.785
<i>but it eluded my grasp.</i>

49:55.994 --> 49:58.079
<i>I know the world
is full of crooks,</i>

49:58.371 --> 49:59.789
<i>but jail is too good</i>

49:59.956 --> 50:01.874
<i>for the guy
who's driving it.</i>

50:02.792 --> 50:05.169
<i>Well, at least
he's kept it waxed.</i>

50:07.755 --> 50:09.090
<i>Would you believe it?</i>

50:09.257 --> 50:10.717
<i>I met a girl</i>

50:11.342 --> 50:12.969
<i>with this Van.</i>

50:13.678 --> 50:15.388
<i>I think she likes me.</i>

50:16.723 --> 50:18.391
<i>Well, that's
all for now.</i>

50:18.558 --> 50:19.558
<i>Sincerely...</i>

50:20.059 --> 50:21.352
Kenny?

50:22.854 --> 50:24.147
What are you writing?

50:25.231 --> 50:26.315
<i>P.S.</i>

50:27.108 --> 50:29.861
<i>The spoiler still looks
kind of high to me.</i>

50:31.320 --> 50:32.697
What is that?

50:33.656 --> 50:35.533
A letter to mommy?

50:35.700 --> 50:37.201
No. It's to
a friend of mine,

50:37.368 --> 50:38.745
one of my teachers.

50:39.537 --> 50:42.040
Teachers... they're
worse than parents.

50:42.206 --> 50:43.624
I hate them all.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.918
There's teachers
and there's teachers.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.503
This one's different.

50:47.670 --> 50:49.130
He helped me
with the car.

50:49.297 --> 50:51.257
Oh, the car.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.593
The car, the car.

50:53.760 --> 50:54.760
I should've guessed.

50:54.886 --> 50:57.472
Hey, hey, I got
a terrific idea.

50:58.264 --> 50:59.640
Why don't you
write a letter

50:59.849 --> 51:01.017
to the car?

51:01.809 --> 51:02.977
Dear car...

51:05.438 --> 51:09.150
I miss you so much.

51:09.317 --> 51:10.568
What are you doing?

51:11.027 --> 51:12.945
Mixing screwdrivers.

51:14.197 --> 51:15.239
Want some?

51:15.406 --> 51:16.616
No, thanks.

51:17.784 --> 51:18.784
Come on.

51:19.160 --> 51:20.536
Vitamin C.

51:21.079 --> 51:22.455
Not for me.

51:23.581 --> 51:25.291
Well, I got to do this.

51:25.958 --> 51:27.251
I'm in training.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.253
If a girl can't
hold her liquor,

51:29.420 --> 51:30.880
falls asleep
with her trick,

51:31.047 --> 51:33.674
and then where is she?

51:37.428 --> 51:38.930
Asleep on her trick.

51:40.890 --> 51:42.183
Is that a fact?

51:43.684 --> 51:46.938
What do you drink...
Motor oil?

51:47.897 --> 51:50.066
You can make jokes
about a lot of things.

51:50.233 --> 51:53.027
I don't want to hear any jokes
about my car till I get it back.

51:53.444 --> 51:54.361
I'm sorry.

51:54.362 --> 51:55.362
Yeah, you're sorry.

51:55.404 --> 51:57.865
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

51:58.032 --> 52:00.326
The trouble is, you don't
know what a Corvette is.

52:01.077 --> 52:02.495
Hand me a washcloth,
would you?

52:02.662 --> 52:05.373
It's not... oh...
an ordinary car.

52:05.540 --> 52:06.958
It's a...

52:07.708 --> 52:08.708
I mean...

52:09.502 --> 52:12.088
Families don't buy them
to go... go... go

52:12.255 --> 52:13.756
to the supermarket in.

52:14.465 --> 52:15.842
Corvette's a man's car.

52:19.679 --> 52:20.679
I mean...

52:21.597 --> 52:24.392
Uh, a woman
might buy one,

52:24.559 --> 52:27.436
but that's only
to get noticed in.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.148
A man drives a Corvette
because that's what it is...

52:30.314 --> 52:31.357
it's a Corvette.

52:31.524 --> 52:33.526
Where are
my pajamas, huh?

52:33.693 --> 52:35.194
Will you
give them to me?

52:42.243 --> 52:44.453
It's fast and powerful.

52:45.371 --> 52:46.873
It handles.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.876
It's beautiful.

52:51.919 --> 52:54.714
It's the only sports car
made in America

52:54.881 --> 52:56.883
and happens to be very...

52:57.049 --> 52:58.426
Important to me.

53:00.845 --> 53:02.138
I know.

53:02.972 --> 53:04.891
It's a terrific car.

53:12.690 --> 53:13.900
What's that?

53:19.071 --> 53:20.740
It was a kiss.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.368
I... I was kissing you.

53:24.577 --> 53:26.370
What do you want
to kiss for?

53:26.871 --> 53:28.372
Let's screw.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.295
Yeah, sure.

54:03.074 --> 54:06.160
You didn't say a word
about my souvenir.

54:11.123 --> 54:12.792
You gave it to me.

54:16.587 --> 54:18.839
My first cash sale.

54:19.590 --> 54:21.300
Some souvenir.

54:23.803 --> 54:25.805
Come on, Kenny.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.780
You want to kiss?

54:49.578 --> 54:51.539
I can kiss.

55:45.551 --> 55:46.594
Oh, she's right

Oh, yes. I've heard
so much about you.

56:07.281 --> 56:08.156
Excuse me.

56:08.157 --> 56:09.450
Uh, I was wondering

56:09.617 --> 56:11.369
if you've got Kenny's
current address.

56:11.535 --> 56:14.372
<i>I haven't heard from him
since school let out.</i>

56:14.538 --> 56:15.538
<i>Look out, Fifi.</i>

56:15.664 --> 56:17.333
He's in Las Vegas.
Did you know that?

56:18.918 --> 56:21.754
Hey, Fred,
did you hear that?

56:21.921 --> 56:23.798
Kenny went to Las Vegas!

56:24.173 --> 56:26.258
Who does he think he is...
Nick the Greek?

56:26.801 --> 56:28.010
He's not in any trouble,
is he?

56:28.177 --> 56:30.137
No. No trouble.
He's fine.

56:30.304 --> 56:32.848
Oh, what a relief.
Thank goodness.

56:33.516 --> 56:35.810
We're moving, and
I have a lot on my mind.

56:36.185 --> 56:37.853
Uh, you going far?

56:38.396 --> 56:40.231
No. Del mar.

56:40.773 --> 56:41.982
What about Kenny?

56:42.900 --> 56:44.985
Oh, don't worry.
He'll find me.

56:45.528 --> 56:47.405
Say, maybe
you could tell him.

56:47.571 --> 56:48.823
That would simplify things.

56:49.698 --> 56:51.534
Oh. Oh.
Fine. Sure.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.993
When I see him,
I'll, uh...

56:53.411 --> 56:55.496
Tell him his mother
moved to Del Mar.

57:24.066 --> 57:26.944
<i>Dear Mr. McGrath,</i>

57:27.570 --> 57:28.696
<i>guess what?</i>

57:29.405 --> 57:32.616
<i>I'm going steady with a girl
from Los Angeles.</i>

57:32.783 --> 57:36.203
<i>Wait till you meet her.
Don't get me wrong.</i>

57:36.370 --> 57:38.205
<i>I still like cars.</i>

57:39.707 --> 57:42.793
<i>I will find that Corvette
sooner or later.</i>

57:43.627 --> 57:44.712
<i>I'm not worried</i>

57:44.879 --> 57:47.381
<i>because Las Vegas
isn't all that big.</i>

57:48.048 --> 57:49.383
<i>Yours truly,</i>

57:50.092 --> 57:51.218
<i>Kenny.</i>

57:53.137 --> 57:54.137
Nice.

57:54.680 --> 57:55.890
Mighty nice.

57:56.098 --> 57:57.056
You like it?

57:57.057 --> 57:58.057
I'll say.

57:58.058 --> 57:59.059
What can I do for you?

57:59.477 --> 58:00.978
I'm looking for a car.

58:07.818 --> 58:08.861
Not bad.

58:09.653 --> 58:10.738
Nice little car.

58:11.697 --> 58:14.033
You kidding me?
Nicer than this one.

58:14.575 --> 58:16.160
Bad guys came,
took it away from me.

58:16.911 --> 58:17.995
Sorry to hear that.

58:18.287 --> 58:19.622
You ever see it around?

58:20.039 --> 58:21.039
Nope.

58:21.415 --> 58:22.415
Too bad.

58:28.964 --> 58:30.049
Hey, kid!

58:30.925 --> 58:32.259
You ought to be careful.

58:32.927 --> 58:34.127
You run up against
a car thief,

58:34.261 --> 58:36.347
you're liable to wind up
at the bottom of lake mead.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.432
I'll remember that.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.252
Hey, stop
what you're doing.

59:07.127 --> 59:08.086
What's up?

59:08.087 --> 59:09.672
Get the Corvette.
Prepare it.

59:10.005 --> 59:11.005
We're going to paint it.

59:18.681 --> 59:21.392
"Working. Back late."

59:28.816 --> 59:30.776
Oh, boy.

59:31.235 --> 59:32.653
Working late.

59:33.362 --> 59:34.863
I'll bet you are.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.431
<i>He said it was
a lipstick commercial,</i>

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:01.849
<i>so naturally
I believed him.</i>

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:05.686
Honey, when they say movie,
you just move on.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:10.399
You really make me sick,
you know that?

01:00:23.704 --> 01:00:25.372
<i>Order, please.</i>

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:26.624
Yeah, uh, give me, uh,

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.710
an everything dog, uh...

01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:31.503
A Danny's diamond dog,

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.214
<i>large order of fries,
and a cherry-lime Rickey.</i>

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.548
<i>Kenny?</i>

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:44.933
You really
take the cake,

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.310
you know that?

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:49.271
What's the matter?
Didn't you get my note?

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:51.649
It's Friday night.
I got to work late weekends.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.651
What happened
to the beauty parlor?

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:57.946
I quit. Nobody accuses me
of petty theft.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:01.659
Anyway, you're going to be
real glad I got this job.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.285
What, free food
from now on?

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:06.246
Yeah, but that's not all.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:09.208
Every car in this city

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:13.295
either comes through
or goes by here.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.630
So?

01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:18.050
I'm helping you, dope.

01:01:18.217 --> 01:01:20.636
I'm helping you
find your car.

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:26.392
Batter up, girl.

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.353
That's, uh, 14 even.

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.190
That's mine.

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:36.443
Hey,
take your mitt off!

01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:45.202
Were you worried about me?

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.080
A little bit.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:53.085
Relax.

Hey, man, I smell
a big tip coming.

01:03:08.327 --> 01:03:11.079
Get the hell out.
I'm taking it.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.499
You're going

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.209
There's enough
for everybody.

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:16.751
Here you go.

01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:18.420
This is your car?

01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:19.462
Yeah.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.589
You brought this
in here?

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.164
Then you're not
going anywhere.

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.258
Whoa.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:24.802
Why not?

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:26.887
Because you stole
this car.

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.054
Hey, I'm out
of this.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.932
I mean, y'all do what you
wanna do, man. I...

01:03:30.265 --> 01:03:31.767
Bye-bye, little buddy.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.671
Aah!

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.301
Hey, sorry, man.
I didn't see you.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.385
Are you all right?

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:08.637
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:04:12.558 --> 01:04:13.558
Hey!

01:04:14.226 --> 01:04:15.226
My bike!

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:56.745
What the hell
are you doing?

01:05:56.912 --> 01:05:57.912
Pull over!

01:05:57.996 --> 01:06:00.207
Get off this car!

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.292
I'm calling the cops.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:03.960
You want to play?

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:04.961
Pull over!

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:08.423
You want me
to pull over?

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:12.594
Get back here, you...

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:23.604
Hey, Wayne!

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:24.731
Get out here!

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.336
This kid ran into me
in the street.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.153
I was at the car wash.
This kid came up.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.532
He said I stole the car.
I'm driving down the street.

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:35.117
He comes up to me
on a bicycle.

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:43.750
Aah!

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:54.386
<i>Pick him up.</i>

01:07:03.145 --> 01:07:04.896
Hi, kid.
Remember me?

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:06.857
You're in a lot
of trouble, boy.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.402
<i>Lock him up.</i>

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.124
Hey, what's
the matter, kid,

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:25.584
you forget your key?

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:34.402
Damn.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.328
O.K., O.K., you got me.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.495
No chain!

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:28.516
Kenny?

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.939
<i>Buenas noches,</i> doll.

01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:36.191
What do you want?

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:37.776
You Vanessa?

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.569
Maybe.

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:43.698
We got your friend.

01:10:43.949 --> 01:10:46.701
Where is he?
What did you do to him?

01:10:48.036 --> 01:10:49.287
Kenny?

01:10:51.373 --> 01:10:52.373
Yecch!

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.712
They're not getting
away with this.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.131
You went to the cops,
right?

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:02.509
No?

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:05.053
Boy, are you stupid.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.180
Well, as soon as we get
you cleaned up,

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.015
that's where you're going.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:10.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:11.725
Set it on wax.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:12.852
Just a minute.

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:16.106
Come here,
let me get your front.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.487
And don't look
so goddamn depressed.

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:26.116
You got them.
And you found your car.

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:28.785
You're a big winner,

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.496
you lucky
son of a bitch.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.508
Kenny.

01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:46.720
Kenny, you did it...

01:11:47.595 --> 01:11:49.806
All by yourself.

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.065
<i>Hey!</i>

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.110
<i>Over here!</i>

01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:13.163
Ha ha ha!

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:14.914
Mr. McGrath!

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.624
Far out!

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.418
Kenny, how you doing?

01:12:18.585 --> 01:12:19.585
Fantastic. Terri...

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:20.795
I've been
looking for you.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:23.798
Great. Just in time.
I found the car.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:26.259
I knew you would. I want to talk
to you about that.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:29.596
You should see these guys.
You talk about bad news...

01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:32.307
mean, stupid,
vicious bastards.

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:34.601
I think they were
getting ready to kill me.

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:35.977
I know they were.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.605
They got some kind
of operation going.

01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:40.940
They work out
of a body shop.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:44.110
I know...
Silverado auto body.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:47.113
Y-yeah.

01:12:47.781 --> 01:12:50.950
Oh, you've been doing
a little spade work, too.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.786
Oh, aren't we something?

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:54.579
We got 'em.

01:12:55.163 --> 01:12:56.307
I even know
the name of the guy

01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.374
that runs the show.

01:12:57.916 --> 01:12:58.958
You do?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.418
Name's Wayne Lowry...

01:13:01.086 --> 01:13:02.879
talented body man,
designer,

01:13:03.171 --> 01:13:04.214
good business head,

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:06.341
very aggressive.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:07.801
Yeah?

01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:09.552
He's a former
student of mine,

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.137
class of '71.

01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:13.890
No shit.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:03.355
Kenny...

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:06.609
You've been
to my house, huh?

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:09.070
You met Marsha.
You know what I got...

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:11.072
pool, orange trees,

01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:12.699
a couple of great kids,
huh?

01:14:13.158 --> 01:14:14.158
Yeah.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:16.786
You know how much
I make a year?

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.998
It must be
kind of rough, huh?

01:14:20.498 --> 01:14:22.250
$13,000.

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:26.379
13,000 lousy dollars.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:31.551
Mr. McGrath,
don't you think

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.553
we ought to go to
the police right away?

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:35.472
I mean, you know,

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.056
if we give 'em
too much time,

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.683
they could get away.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:40.977
This truck...

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.605
Paying monthly for it.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.499
The mortgage payments
on the house,

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:46.774
they were killing me.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.735
They upped the taxes 100%.

01:14:48.902 --> 01:14:50.862
I'm just a little guy,
Kenny, a teacher,

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.530
<i>and I'm getting killed.</i>

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.429
Everyone has to answer
the question...

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:57.702
am I a sucker or what?

01:14:57.869 --> 01:14:59.329
We all play the game,

01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:01.206
but who makes up the rules?

01:15:01.915 --> 01:15:03.750
Oh, Mr. McGrath.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:08.087
One day a fellow comes to me
with a proposition,

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:09.464
a former student of mine

01:15:09.756 --> 01:15:11.257
doing very well
for himself.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.885
You mean...

01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:17.555
You stole the Corvette?

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:23.895
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:25.479
Jesus.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.191
<i>I'm sorry. You got to see that
car for what it is.</i>

01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:30.276
It's a commodity
to be bought and sold

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.570
just like everything
on this earth.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.366
So you go to the police.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:38.201
You know what happens?

01:15:39.077 --> 01:15:40.203
I go to jail.

01:15:41.204 --> 01:15:42.539
My wife loses the house...

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:43.915
Probably her mind.

01:15:44.374 --> 01:15:45.750
Kids are disgraced.

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.545
<i>Is that what you want
to do to my family?</i>

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.881
We're talking about
a victimless crime here.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.550
Who got hurt?

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.427
The insurance company
pays off.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:58.471
What the hell?
They can afford it.

01:15:59.806 --> 01:16:01.516
So you go to the police?

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:03.183
No.

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:05.250
<i>You got a good head
on your shoulders</i>

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:06.854
<i>and a hell of a touch.</i>

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.400
<i>There's no reason
we can't put you to work.</i>

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.735
<i>I'm not talking about
pumping gas.</i>

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:16.239
I'm talking about
$700 a week,

01:16:16.614 --> 01:16:18.575
and you get to do
what you were born to do.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.660
How many people
get that chance?

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:24.831
How come you never
said anything?

01:16:25.123 --> 01:16:27.333
We laid up all that
fiberglass together.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.500
You never sa...

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:29.459
how was I to know

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.629
you'd fall in love
with a pile of junk?

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:36.843
Are you worried about
living in Las Vegas?

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:37.926
No.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:38.946
You worried about
your mother?

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:39.845
No.

01:16:39.846 --> 01:16:43.182
Good, because
Mom has gone to Del Mar.

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:44.725
Del mar?

01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:46.352
<i>Yeah. She's got
a boyfriend.</i>

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.439
Look, Kenny,
I'm offering you a job.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.109
Tell me, please,
you'll take it.

01:16:55.028 --> 01:16:56.028
I don't know.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.239
You got to know!
You got to know right now!

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.950
Why are you doing this?

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.578
You don't owe me
anything.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:06.372
Look behind me.

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:15.381
<i>I don't like him
any more than you do,</i>

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:18.426
but if I don't
hit my lights here

01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:20.595
in just about a minute,

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.723
he'll come over here
and handle it his way.

01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:26.684
<i>He calls the shots,
Kenny. I don't.</i>

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:29.187
<i>Come on.</i>

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.397
<i>Say yes, huh?</i>

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:33.941
<i>Come on.</i>

01:17:35.026 --> 01:17:36.277
<i>Come on. Please.</i>

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:48.915
Was a hell of a car.

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:55.672
We should've lowered
the spoiler, huh?

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:40.007
<i>It's 9:30.</i>

01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:42.885
He's coming. He's coming.
He'll be here.

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:44.469
<i>I'm not worried.</i>

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:47.765
I'm just saying it's 9:30,
and you been had.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.244
Something tells me
this little Turkey

01:18:50.268 --> 01:18:52.061
is smarter than
you thought he was.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.563
Keep your shirt on.

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:00.403
I see him.

01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:09.912
Morning, Kenny.
How you feeling?

01:19:10.997 --> 01:19:11.997
Fine.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:14.333
I want you to meet the man
you're gonna work for.

01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:18.337
Wayne Lowry.

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:23.342
Hey, Jeff, Tony.
Get over here.

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:25.470
<i>Meet a guy
who knows about cars.</i>

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:26.511
Alright.

01:19:26.512 --> 01:19:29.098
Listen, I'm really sorry
about that chain.

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.266
I'm sorry
about that.

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:31.558
Hello, again.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.270
No hard feelings,
right?

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.522
<i>We're starting
from scratch, right?</i>

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:38.273
Wrong.

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:40.943
<i>That 700 a week?</i>

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.488
<i>Not enough.</i>

01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:45.155
<i>850.</i>

01:19:45.156 --> 01:19:46.156
Now, wait a minute.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.659
First week in advance.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:52.996
There you go.

01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:55.166
I see what you're doing.

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.460
I'd do the same thing.

01:19:58.336 --> 01:20:00.713
<i>Make 'em pay you what
you're worth, right?</i>

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.366
Come on.

01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:33.830
Gee, Mr. Sinatra,

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:35.790
I didn't know
you were in town.

01:20:36.207 --> 01:20:38.543
I could go for you
in a big way.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:42.588
That one.

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:48.094
What are you
trying to pull?

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.807
Oh, I love it.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:02.733
Kenny...
Did you sell your car?

01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:04.277
<i>No, no.</i>

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.112
That wasn't your car
to sell.

01:21:06.279 --> 01:21:07.506
That belonged
to the high school.

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.156
<i>I never sold it.</i>

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.117
So, uh...

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:15.329
Where did all this money
come from, Mr. Dantley?

01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:18.583
You didn't pay for this
with a $2.00 bill.

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:21.252
I got a job.

01:21:21.419 --> 01:21:22.962
<i>Pays 850 a week.</i>

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:26.883
850 a week?

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:28.968
We do custom work.

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:31.679
Special cars
for special people.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:34.724
Oh, I get it.

01:21:35.683 --> 01:21:37.226
You're going to make it
an inside job.

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.395
Steal your own car back.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:42.023
<i>You think
you can pull it off?</i>

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.401
What are you
talking about?

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:48.446
850 a week. That's
what I'm pulling off.

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:50.865
Well, what about your car?

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.538
You've got to see it
for what it is.

01:21:57.914 --> 01:21:59.707
It's a commodity
to be bought and sold

01:21:59.874 --> 01:22:01.709
like anything else
on this earth.

01:22:04.754 --> 01:22:05.963
<i>Don't laugh.</i>

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:09.300
I'm not telling you
anything new.

01:22:12.136 --> 01:22:13.346
Thing is...

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:17.433
I can have
any car I want now...

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:22.605
A Corvette...

01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:25.358
A Cadillac...

01:22:29.904 --> 01:22:31.489
A Lamborghini.

01:22:32.031 --> 01:22:33.616
Lamborghini.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:36.577
What's the matter?

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:40.957
Oh, it's... it's great,
I guess.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.249
Um...

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:44.835
Wait a minute.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.798
I got something
that'll cheer you up.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.637
I'm a paying customer.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:56.931
Oh, Jesus.

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:02.770
What am I doing?

01:23:03.354 --> 01:23:05.147
You're worth a lot more
than 20 bucks.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:06.857
Here's another 50.

01:23:08.025 --> 01:23:10.611
And you're worth
a lot more than that.

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:17.451
You keep your money.

01:23:19.996 --> 01:23:21.956
This one's on the house.

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:34.552
O.K. Hold it
right there.

01:23:44.562 --> 01:23:47.523
Hi there. Looking for
some paint for my wheels.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:48.858
Sorry, man.
We don't do vans.

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:50.651
I just want
to get rid of this.

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:53.279
I want it to say
"Pete's pulsator."

01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:56.157
Really classy. Try
Orlando's down the street.

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:59.660
Hey, where'd
you get this?

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:01.829
It's my new Van.
I just bought it.

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:03.456
Bullshit.

01:24:03.831 --> 01:24:05.541
You're a car thief.

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:07.960
Look at that back window

01:24:08.127 --> 01:24:10.671
and tell me how much
bullshit you want to eat.

01:24:12.173 --> 01:24:13.758
Got it from Alslip's
this morning.

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.093
Had a waterbed
in the back.

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.845
Wasn't nothing
but a boff buggy.

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:19.388
Orlando's your man.

01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:20.764
Thank you.

01:24:25.019 --> 01:24:26.228
What's so
goddamn funny?

01:24:26.896 --> 01:24:29.565
You, man, calling that guy
a car thief.

01:24:30.066 --> 01:24:31.484
Jesus.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:38.156
Vanessa?

01:24:38.491 --> 01:24:39.492
<i>Who?</i>

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:42.036
Come on, already.
Will you talk to me?

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:44.538
<i>Sorry, pal.
She missed two days' work,</i>

01:24:44.705 --> 01:24:46.540
<i>and she owes me
for some meals.</i>

01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:47.917
<i>Hey, stay right there!</i>

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:16.070
<i>Is that you?</i>

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:18.030
I beg your pardon?

01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:21.700
I mean, wow!

01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.371
No wonder you're not
slingin' hamburgers anymore.

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.206
Have we met?

01:25:27.373 --> 01:25:29.291
I don't believe
I know you.

01:25:30.084 --> 01:25:31.084
What?

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:32.378
Here you go,
Rosalind.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:33.586
Play with these.

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:37.216
Oh, Mr. Blanchard,
I'm losing all your money.

01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:38.926
How about
another drink?

01:25:42.388 --> 01:25:45.558
Rosalind? Oh, that's
the Rosalind crap again.

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:47.601
Where did you
get that dress?

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:48.978
Would you shut up?

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:50.247
If you think...
just because...

01:25:50.271 --> 01:25:51.522
let's take a walk.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.235
Great, great, great.
Just terrific.

01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:57.528
You finally
went and did it.

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:58.863
A hooker.
The real thing.

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:00.948
Where do you get off?

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:04.493
I'm getting 100 bucks a shot,
and you know what I'm doing?

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:07.454
Body work... just like you.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.432
Rosalind,
where'd you go?

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:10.916
Oh, coming.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:16.088
Creep. $100. $100.
I'll give you $200. 1,000.

01:26:16.255 --> 01:26:17.339
You don't have
to do this.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:18.507
Come on, Kenny.

01:26:18.674 --> 01:26:20.467
It's not your money
I'm after.

01:26:20.968 --> 01:26:22.303
Here you go, gin-gin.

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:23.386
Who's your friend?

01:26:23.387 --> 01:26:27.141
Oh, this is just
my cousin homer.

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:28.642
Goodbye, homer.

01:26:28.893 --> 01:26:30.311
Call me tomorrow.

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:33.314
Say, you wouldn't want
to get in on the action.

01:26:33.606 --> 01:26:35.107
I got some friends
coming by.

01:26:35.274 --> 01:26:37.276
Its gonna be
a hell of a party.

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:39.445
I'd make it
worth your while.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.430
Hey, enough
is enough.

01:27:06.597 --> 01:27:08.098
Beer time.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:14.103
O.K.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:26.325
<i>Hey, don't forget to turn off
the lights and lock up.</i>

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:50.034
What is that?

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:55.039
Wow.

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:01.170
What the hell happened?

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:02.421
Look out!

01:29:04.673 --> 01:29:06.884
Oh, you son of a...

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:08.135
Ow!

01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:10.846
That's it.

01:29:11.472 --> 01:29:12.472
Yeah!

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:15.351
Give him to me, baby.
Come on, now.

01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:16.894
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:20.105
This time I got you. Ha!

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:21.564
Yeah.

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:22.566
Now!

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:29.490
Ow!

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.969
Sir, the keys?

01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:00.979
<i>I'll get it.</i>

01:30:03.774 --> 01:30:04.900
Hello, old buddy.

01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:06.610
I'm glad you made it.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.991
Take it easy, pal.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:14.493
I don't want
any trouble.

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.453
I've got expensive
equipment here.

01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:21.375
Kenny Dantley, get your ass
out of here!

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:23.335
I'm going to
call the cops.

01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:24.670
Oh, no!
Don't do that.

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:26.338
You in the tub...

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:31.135
You're checking out.

01:30:33.137 --> 01:30:34.137
I'm not coming!

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.682
Who do you think
you are, anyway?

01:30:36.849 --> 01:30:39.309
You have no right
to take me anywhere.

01:30:45.107 --> 01:30:47.985
I just want to get
my flipper off.

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:49.319
Oh!

01:30:50.571 --> 01:30:53.907
I don't want to go!
You're embarrassing me!

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.287
Oh! Let me go!

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:00.873
Oh! I'm going
to smack you!

01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:02.958
Oh, and what's this?

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:05.502
Where's your
Lamborghini, big shot?

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.187
I'm not gonna forget
what I saw.

01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:24.980
You were making
a dirty movie.

01:31:25.147 --> 01:31:26.565
I was not!

01:31:26.732 --> 01:31:28.233
Yeah? What do you
call it, a pg?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.654
It was not a movie.
It was a short.

01:32:27.793 --> 01:32:28.793
Oh!

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:02.202
Stop this car!
I'm getting out!

01:33:02.369 --> 01:33:03.620
Oh, no, you're not!

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:22.514
We're going
the wrong way!

01:33:22.681 --> 01:33:25.517
I know. I'm trying
to get us on the freeway.

01:33:27.436 --> 01:33:29.438
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:32.024
That was it, dumbo.
You missed it.

01:33:33.066 --> 01:33:34.359
I got it. Hold on.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.120
What are you doing?
Where's the freeway?

01:33:45.329 --> 01:33:48.040
I got it. Look for
a place to turn around.

01:33:49.249 --> 01:33:50.876
Are you doing this
on purpose?

01:33:52.044 --> 01:33:54.463
Oh, I see
what's happening,

01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:57.257
and you don't
fool me a bit.

01:33:57.424 --> 01:33:58.424
Look out!

01:34:25.202 --> 01:34:27.913
You had this planned
the whole time.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.956
Trying to scare me,
huh, you little creep?

01:34:30.123 --> 01:34:33.001
Well, it's not gonna work.
I'm enjoying it, see?

01:34:33.293 --> 01:34:34.753
I love this.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.881
Boy, are you a nut.
Where's that freeway?

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:42.636
Uh-oh.

01:34:45.722 --> 01:34:48.475
What's he supposed to be
doing, shooting at us?

01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:53.814
Bang, bang,
yourself, Mac.

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:55.524
Get down!
What are you doing?

01:35:57.419 --> 01:35:58.587
That's it.

01:35:58.795 --> 01:36:01.006
That's it!
I knew I'd find it!

01:36:01.506 --> 01:36:03.091
The freeway!

01:36:20.567 --> 01:36:22.486
End of the line, folks.

01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:24.404
So what happens now,

01:36:24.571 --> 01:36:26.948
you turn around
and take me home?

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:30.076
Looks like I have to.

01:36:51.765 --> 01:36:52.765
Aah!

01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:54.226
You're insane!

01:36:58.855 --> 01:37:01.107
Kenny! Kenny!
Kenny, stop!

01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:02.818
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

01:37:06.822 --> 01:37:08.490
Aah!

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:17.123
Whoa!

01:38:26.318 --> 01:38:27.318
He's back!

01:38:27.319 --> 01:38:28.319
I don't believe it!

01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:31.031
Wow! Amy,
come here and look!

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:36.453
Isn't it great?

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.288
Hot!

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:43.376
You wait right here.

01:38:44.127 --> 01:38:45.629
This won't take long.

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:57.390
<i>- Uh-oh. Look out.
- Oh, brother.</i>

01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:04.856
Alright, now.
No running.

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:06.858
Stay single file.

01:39:08.568 --> 01:39:09.569
Hey, look!

01:39:09.736 --> 01:39:10.779
The car! It's back!

01:39:10.946 --> 01:39:11.947
Hey, come on!

01:39:12.322 --> 01:39:13.406
<i>It's back!</i>

01:39:18.954 --> 01:39:20.330
What happened to it?

01:39:27.170 --> 01:39:29.506
Who is responsible for this?

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:31.383
Who set off that alarm?

01:39:34.636 --> 01:39:35.762
Good lord.

01:39:39.975 --> 01:39:41.184
<i>Is this our car?</i>

01:39:41.518 --> 01:39:43.478
<i>Yes, sir. It is.</i>

01:39:43.645 --> 01:39:45.522
You! Young lady!

01:39:46.856 --> 01:39:49.150
Do you have
an explanation to offer?

01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:52.028
Sure don't, Jack.

01:39:52.904 --> 01:39:53.947
Excuse me.

01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:56.491
Well, who does?

01:39:56.908 --> 01:39:58.410
Ask bozo.

01:40:00.412 --> 01:40:01.579
Bozo?

01:40:03.456 --> 01:40:04.456
<i>Dantley!</i>

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:08.044
How did you
get it back?

01:40:09.379 --> 01:40:10.547
<i>Let's just say...</i>

01:40:12.257 --> 01:40:13.258
I found it.

01:40:14.259 --> 01:40:15.427
And what about
the police?

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:16.678
You've talked
to them?

01:40:16.845 --> 01:40:18.179
<i>They are
aware of this?</i>

01:40:18.596 --> 01:40:19.596
No.

01:40:20.557 --> 01:40:21.641
They don't know a thing.

01:40:22.267 --> 01:40:24.185
<i>You should have.
They should be informed.</i>

01:40:26.563 --> 01:40:27.981
What's the difference?

01:40:29.441 --> 01:40:30.942
You got the car back,
didn't you?

01:40:35.739 --> 01:40:36.948
Alright,
everybody.

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:38.950
Back inside.

01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:41.828
The fire drill
is over.

01:40:45.206 --> 01:40:46.206
Uh, Mr. Bacon?

01:40:46.416 --> 01:40:47.500
Yes, Dantley?

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:49.544
There is one thing.

01:40:49.878 --> 01:40:50.962
<i>What is it?</i>

01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:54.007
I'd like my diploma.

01:40:54.174 --> 01:40:55.174
Yes, of course.

01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:56.676
It's in my office.

01:40:57.635 --> 01:40:59.220
Kenny,
can I talk to you?

01:40:59.387 --> 01:41:00.597
What do you want?

01:41:00.889 --> 01:41:01.890
What happened?

01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:03.057
Money wasn't
good enough?

01:41:03.141 --> 01:41:04.517
Couldn't get along
with Wayne?

01:41:04.684 --> 01:41:05.810
Should have
called me.

01:41:06.019 --> 01:41:07.604
Kenny, listen to me,
please.

01:41:08.021 --> 01:41:11.900
You need money,
another car, a job.

01:41:12.358 --> 01:41:14.444
Give you my best
recommendation.

01:41:20.283 --> 01:41:22.243
I got it! Ta-da!

01:41:30.043 --> 01:41:31.669
Congratulations.

01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:34.870
Where you going
with my Diplo...

01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:37.550
Kenny, tell me what
I got to hear. Please.

01:41:39.052 --> 01:41:40.720
So long, Mr. McGrath.

01:41:41.387 --> 01:41:43.807
<i>Kenny. Kenny, please.</i>

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:45.975
Hey, Kenny,
where you going?

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:47.685
Stick around.
Meet me after school.

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:48.852
Nah.

01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:50.563
What about the car?
Going to buy it?

01:41:50.939 --> 01:41:51.940
Nope.

01:41:52.315 --> 01:41:54.442
What?
It's a terrific car.

01:41:54.859 --> 01:41:57.570
Superior mags,
Mercury tubes,

01:41:57.737 --> 01:41:59.239
Gabriel shocks.

01:42:00.907 --> 01:42:03.034
Why don't you
buy it, Kootz.

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:06.496
Hey, Kenny.
Where you going?

01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:08.206
Hey, Kenny?

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:10.416
Hey, you
with the funny walk.

01:42:10.959 --> 01:42:13.253
Come on. You're not
all that tough.

01:42:13.419 --> 01:42:14.253
Give me my diploma.

01:42:14.254 --> 01:42:16.673
You think I spent five years
here for an empty envelope?

01:42:16.965 --> 01:42:20.802
Oh... danger!

01:42:21.136 --> 01:42:22.679
You mad because
I gave the car back?

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.060
Ha ha!

01:42:31.354 --> 01:42:33.398
Ah, I see what it is.

01:42:35.275 --> 01:42:36.317
Any guy...

01:42:37.569 --> 01:42:38.945
That doesn't own a Corvette

01:42:39.112 --> 01:42:41.656
just doesn't get a kiss
from you.
