I HA\/EN'T DATED A GIRL, READ A BOOK

06:54.247 --> 06:56.488
BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE
TIME AWAY FROM THE GAME.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.415

NOTHING ELSE.

06:58.501 --> 07:02.836

BOTH MEN FACED DEATH DAILY
AND BOTH ARE LEGENDS.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.985
YOU NEVER MAKE THE GRADE AT
ANYTHING BY PLAYING IT SAFE.

IN THE CORNER.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.566
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, JESSE?

17:46.649 --> 17:49.061
THERE'S MORE TO LIFE
THAN THIS POOL HALL.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.319
IT ISN'T RIGHT YOUR BEING ALL
COOPED UP IN HERE LIKE THIS.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.897
YOU OUGHT TO GET OUT A
LITTLE, SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.608
YOU DIDN'T GET TO BE THE BEST
SITTING ON A PARK BENCH.

17:57.702 --> 18:00.160
YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME VVITH
THAT OUE IN YOUR HANDS.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.614
<i>OF COURSE I DID. BUT I TOOK
TIME OUT TO LIVE, TOO.</i>

18:03.708 --> 18:06.416

<i>BUT I MADE LOVE, WALKED
UPHILL, SWAM IN THE OCEAN.</i>

18:15.595 --> 18:19.930
VVHEN I THINK OF THE VVONDERFUL THINGS
THERE ARE TO SEE AND TO DO, IT HURTS ME.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.098
YEAH.

18:22.184 --> 18:26.269
TO SEE YOU ROTTING YOUR LIFE AVVAY
IN THIS MISERABLE, DARK HALL.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.521
YOU'RE LYING. YOU'RE
TRYING TO DISTRACT ME.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.441
THAT'S A LOUSY
THING TO DO.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.689

YOU MADE ME DO THAT!
YOU MADE ME MISS!

18:50.630 --> 18:54.874
AVV, COME ON, A LITTLE GAMESMANSHIP,
A LITTLE FUN AND YOU COME APART.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.631
KID STUFF TO MAKE YOU BREAK YOUR
CONCENTRATION AND YOU GET VVILD.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.666
THERE IT IS.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.578
THE GAME BALL.

19:33.673 --> 19:38.634
ALL MY LIFE I'\/E BEEN VVAITING FOR
THIS, lT'S- IT'S A POCKET HANGER.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.922
I SINK THAT, I
BECOME THE GREATEST.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.929
<i>IF YOU SINK IT.</i>

19:47.019 --> 19:49.181
<i>YOU'RE SWEATING.
WHY YOU SO NERVOUS?</i>

19:49.230 --> 19:53.098
OH, FOR REASONS I'M AFRAID
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.524
OH, NO, NO, I
UNDERSTAND ALL RIGHT.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.776
IT MEANS A LOT, DOESN'T IT?
E\/EN AS A DEAD MAN.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.527
HAVE YOUR NAME UP THERE. "THE
UNBEATABLE CHAMP OF ALL TIMES!"

20:01.575 --> 20:03.566
CARRIES CERTAIN
SATISFACTIONS, YES.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.743
"I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE
AT MY CROWN, JESSE,

20:05.830 --> 20:08.538
BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE VVILLING TO
STAKE YOUR LIFE ON THE GAME!"

20:08.582 --> 20:10.994
COULDN'T BE A NICE FRIENDLY,
LITTLE GAME, HUH?

20:11.085 --> 20:15.955
I TAKE THEM AS I FIND THEM. TO YOU,
POOL IS NOT A NIOE, FRIENDLY GAME.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.882
IT'S A VVIN-AT- ANY-PRICE AFFAIR.
I ACTED ACCORDINGLY.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.256
IT DIDN'T DO
YOU ANY GOOD.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.963
YOU KNOVV, JESSE, THERE'S
STILL ONE BALL ON THE TABLE

20:25.057 --> 20:30.393
AND IT'S TAKING YOU A MIGHTY
LONG TIME TO GET AT IT. VVHY?

20:30.479 --> 20:32.311
YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE THIS, JESSE,

20:32.398 --> 20:35.231
BUT PERSONALLY, I'D
LIKE TO SEE YOU WIN.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.978
YEAH.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.312
BELIEVE ME, I'VE ONLY
BEEN DOING MY JOB.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.898
SOMEONE HAS
TO KEEP THE FLAME.

20:42.950 --> 20:46.909
SOMEONE HAS TO VVEED OUT THOSE
VVHO HAVEN'T GOT VVHAT IT TAKES.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.163
YOU SEE, THE CHAMPIONS,
THE LEGENDS,

20:50.249 --> 20:52.115
THEY SERVE
AS A PURPOSE,

20:52.209 --> 20:55.247
<i>A CHALLENGE,
AN INCENTIVE.</i>

20:55.296 --> 20:56.752
I DON'T NEED
A CHALLENGE.

20:56.839 --> 21:00.082
EVERYONE NEEDS
A CHALLENGE, JESSE.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.294
SOMEONE GREAT OUT
OF THE PAST TO SAY,

21:03.387 --> 21:06.129
"MATCH VVHAT I'\/E DONE,
BOY, AND MAKE IT BETTER."

21:06.223 --> 21:08.089
THAT'S TRUE IN
ALL WALKS OF LIFE.

21:08.142 --> 21:11.851
MUSIC, POLITICS,
SPORTS, YOU NAME IT.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.931
ME, I'M ONLY
A POOL PLAYER,

21:16.025 --> 21:17.265
BUT I'M THE BEST.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.067
YOU <i>WERE</i> THE BEST.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.439
WAIT A MINUTE, JESSE.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.992
BEFORE YOU SHOOT, THINK
OF THIS. SHOOT THAT BALL,

21:28.078 --> 21:30.285
AND YOU MAY WIN MORE
THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.785
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN
SAY THAT WILL STOP ME.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.336
NOTHING.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.537
I'M SORRY. I WAS
REQUIRED TO SAY THAT.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.733

BARGAINED FOR, HUH?

22:00.820 --> 22:05.735

I'M THE BEST
AT SOMETHING.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.825
THANKS.

I BEAT YOU, I'M THE BEST,
AND I'M GONNA Ll\/E.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.582
OF COURSE YOU ARE,
THOSE WERE THE STAKES.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.005

THE THANKS, FAT BOY?

22:23.050 --> 22:26.759
