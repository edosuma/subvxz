00:00.934 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk
like you always do.

Catch all-new episodes Sundays

our other Fox programs--

00:08.509 --> 00:11.610
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,
Bob's Burgers <i>and</i> Family Guy.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.480
What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.482 --> 00:15.714
Only on Fox.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.691
WIGGUM:
Yeah, I know <i>Ralphie's birthday</i>
<i>is coming up.</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:27.693
Of course
I'm gonna get him a present.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.963
I'm at the...
at the toy store right now.

00:30.965 --> 00:33.032
Let's see,
present for Ralph,

00:33.034 --> 00:34.800
present for Ralph...

00:34.802 --> 00:36.502
Ooh, what do we have here?

00:36.504 --> 00:39.471
Boy, Ralph would kill himself
with this in two seconds.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.373
And somehow it'd be <i>my</i> fault.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.875
Mm!

00:43.977 --> 00:46.645
This money has been sitting here
since 1998,

00:46.647 --> 00:48.847
not doing anybody any good.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.883
I want to get Ralphie
something nice.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.752
Yeah, a few thousand should do.
Hm-mm.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.990
(whistling a tune)

00:57.992 --> 00:59.491
Uh, you heard me
whistling there, right?

00:59.493 --> 01:01.360
That indicates innocence.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.196
Uh, proclaiming your innocence
indicates guilt.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.898
Uh, yeah?
Well, what does this mean?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.699
♪ Skiddily bop and bah!

01:07.701 --> 01:09.501
(whooping)

01:09.503 --> 01:12.004
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

01:12.006 --> 01:13.705
(kids shouting playfully,
noisemaker honking)

01:13.707 --> 01:16.341
Okay, so, at a Ralph party,
always get to the cake before...

01:16.343 --> 01:17.176
Too late.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.644
(both gasp)

01:20.080 --> 01:23.248
HOMER: That's the best damn
treehouse I've ever seen!

01:24.851 --> 01:27.553
(heavenly music plays)

01:27.555 --> 01:29.955
Fine. I'll rub my eyes
the other way.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.192
(inspiring orchestral
fanfare plays)

01:33.194 --> 01:34.259
D'oh!

01:34.261 --> 01:36.829
(lively chatter, laughing)

01:38.932 --> 01:40.532
Whee!

01:40.534 --> 01:42.101
Whee...!

01:43.069 --> 01:44.103

01:44.105 --> 01:46.004
The September issue!

01:50.076 --> 01:52.978

02:02.422 --> 02:04.957
Whoo! Free wood!

02:06.059 --> 02:07.059

02:07.061 --> 02:10.129

my treehouse sucks.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.263
Haw-haw!

02:11.265 --> 02:13.398
(singsongy):
You have class envy!

02:13.400 --> 02:14.299
(slurring):
Nelson, honey,

02:14.301 --> 02:17.069
I told you to stop
sayin' "haw-haw."

02:17.071 --> 02:19.071
Give me a dollar
and I'll stop.

02:19.073 --> 02:20.806
I don't got a dollar.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.141
Haw-haw!

02:22.143 --> 02:23.609
(Homer hums happily)

02:23.611 --> 02:25.911
Do you want to practice
your speech on me?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.746
(chuckles)
No need, honey.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.414
Same speech
I give every year.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.618
The opening joke about
Lenny's grandma always kills.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.086
You can't joke about her--

02:34.088 --> 02:35.988
they just put her
on life support.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.257
What?! No!
She's the linchpin!

02:38.259 --> 02:40.259
It's okay, it's okay.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.595
Everyone is terrified
of public speaking.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.265
But just in case, I'll
defrost a failure ham.

02:46.267 --> 02:50.169
(dramatic musical stinger)

02:50.171 --> 02:52.804
You don't have faith in me!
I have savers.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.574
If I get heckled, I'll say,
"Get a half-life!"

02:57.177 --> 02:59.978
I'm sure that'll
be funny to them.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.446
Mm! (kisses)

03:01.448 --> 03:02.814
(whimpers)

03:02.816 --> 03:04.783
Calm down, Homer.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.385
Just leave your body.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.087
Oh, no!

03:12.458 --> 03:14.960
What the hell is this?!

03:14.962 --> 03:16.795
(humming happily)

03:16.797 --> 03:18.130
(startled grunt)

03:18.132 --> 03:20.999
Ooh, throwing away
your "No Girls" sign?

03:21.001 --> 03:24.136
Is it time for you to have
"the talk" with your dad?

03:24.138 --> 03:27.206
Because he's gonna have
to read a few things first.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.874
No. I'm tearing it down.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.310
Ralph has a cool treehouse,
and mine sucks.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.712
Well, Bart, your
father built it,

03:33.714 --> 03:36.148
and he did the
very best he could.

03:36.150 --> 03:37.649
(grunting)

03:37.651 --> 03:40.185
I did <i>my</i> job.
Now it's your turn, tree.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.321
Get growing.

03:42.323 --> 03:46.058
I'll tell you what, why don't
I spruce it up for you. Huh?

03:46.060 --> 03:48.060
But you're
an inside grown-up.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.062
Moms can't build
treehouses.

03:50.064 --> 03:54.233
You realize that saying
that is gonna make this
mom work her keister off

03:54.235 --> 03:57.736
to make you the best darn
treehouse you ever saw!

03:58.871 --> 04:00.706
Sounds good.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.040
(Marge screams)

04:02.042 --> 04:02.908
Don't worry.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.876
You forget, most of that's hair.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.044
BURNS (chuckles):
<i>So I said,</i>

04:06.046 --> 04:07.713
"Get a half-life!"

04:07.715 --> 04:08.814
(laughter)

04:13.720 --> 04:15.020
(chuckles)

04:15.022 --> 04:16.255
Funny and handsome.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.023
And I hear he's loaded.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.358
(chuckles):
Yes.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.927
Now, to end this perfect
day on the perfect note,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.096
Mr. Homer Simpson.

04:25.064 --> 04:28.433
(footsteps echoing)

04:32.372 --> 04:34.773
(footsteps echoing louder)

04:37.377 --> 04:38.910
(man coughs)

04:38.912 --> 04:40.612
You're gonna do great, Homer.
You're gonna kill.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.682
You're gonna-- oh, where did
all these people come from?!

04:45.051 --> 04:46.551
(gunshot)
Aah!

04:46.553 --> 04:48.120
Uh, uh...

04:48.122 --> 04:51.290
Webster's Dictionary
defines... a speech

04:51.292 --> 04:55.927
as a... series of words that...

04:55.929 --> 04:58.463
(murmuring)
elo... quently...

04:58.465 --> 05:00.399
I've never seen anyone
bomb like that.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.934
Yeah. I really feel
badly for the guy.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.403
Boo!
Boo!

05:04.405 --> 05:06.872
(audience booing)

05:08.741 --> 05:10.309
(whimpering, shuddering)

05:10.311 --> 05:11.943
I'm a failure.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.578
Shall I release
the hounds, sir?

05:13.580 --> 05:16.548
Mm, the therapy hounds.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.088
Oh, oh, I feel a little better.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.923
Now release the real hounds.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.491
(dogs barking)

05:26.493 --> 05:27.926
(Homer screaming)

05:27.928 --> 05:29.161
It's a pretty good
seminar this year.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.468
Dad, what's wrong?
Did your speech go badly?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.003
How do you know
something's wrong?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.971
You're drinking
from a can of corn.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.840
Hmm? Eh.

05:44.644 --> 05:46.511
Aw, Dad, do you know
Barbra Streisand

05:46.513 --> 05:48.814
once forgot
the words to a song

05:48.816 --> 05:52.117
and didn't perform in public
again for nearly three decades?

05:52.119 --> 05:54.953
Yeah, but she still had
James Brolin to cuddle.

05:54.955 --> 05:58.123
So, on a scale of
ten to ten, how'd you do?

05:58.125 --> 05:59.791
Um...

05:59.793 --> 06:01.693
(water dripping)

06:04.130 --> 06:06.198
♪ Drip drop, you flop

06:06.200 --> 06:08.300

is your problem, idiot!

06:16.009 --> 06:18.009
(kettle whistling,
Homer gasping)

06:18.011 --> 06:18.877
I don't know!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.413
(sobbing):
I don't know!

06:24.150 --> 06:25.984
(Homer whimpers)

06:25.986 --> 06:27.819
I know what will cheer you up.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.055
We'll go to the comedy club
downtown.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.325
Downtown? With all
those desperate addicts?

06:33.327 --> 06:36.161
Oh, the city cleaned them up
and made them comics.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.496
Cool!

06:37.498 --> 06:40.365
Homie, you're gonna chuckle
your blues away.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.534
This is the best
kind of comedy.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.569
No writers.
Amen to that, Marge.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.538
And I appreciate this,
but I really resent

06:46.540 --> 06:47.906
the two-drink minimum!

06:47.908 --> 06:50.008
You always drink more
than two drinks.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.910
But no one <i>makes</i> me.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.613
Three Long Island
iced teas, please.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.083
Okay, we're gonna perform
a little improv.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.851
First we need a location.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.053
Uh, 40.7 degrees
north latitude,

07:02.055 --> 07:04.523
74 degrees
west longitude.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.058
Ah, yes, New York City.
Now we need a relationship

07:07.060 --> 07:08.260
for me and Cathy here.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.728
Loveless marriage!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.863
(laughs):
Okay, I heard loveless marriage.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.198
These guys are pros.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.434
All they did was ask
for two premises.

07:15.436 --> 07:18.103
That's two more
than <i>you've</i> asked for.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.871
(sighs):
Oh, boy.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.073
All right, all we need now
is an object.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.175
Anyone.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.878
(quietly):
Fear of public speaking

07:26.880 --> 07:28.046
Sorry, didn't hear that.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.049
Oh... fear of public speaking.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.051
Maybe he has trouble
talking in the dark.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.053
Hey, Jerry,
bring up number seven.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.921
(shrieks)

07:35.923 --> 07:37.222
No! Jerry, no!

07:37.224 --> 07:39.090
Aah! No! Aah!

07:39.092 --> 07:40.392
Jerry, stop it! No!

07:40.394 --> 07:41.726
Don't... Aah!

07:41.728 --> 07:44.396
Oh, no! Oh-ho-ho! Aah! Oh!

07:44.398 --> 07:47.399
Okay, okay, okay, um...
fear of public speaking.

07:47.401 --> 07:49.067
Well, that's
not really an object,

07:49.069 --> 07:50.402
but we'll make it work.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.103
New York City,
loveless marriage,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.072
fear of public speaking.

07:54.074 --> 07:57.576
They've pulled back the bow--
now let the arrow take flight.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.811
You know, I'm gonna
move over a seat.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.447
We now take you to an apartment

08:02.449 --> 08:05.450
on 68th and
Columbus Avenue.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.587

Oh... eeh...

08:08.589 --> 08:11.256
aah... aah... ooh...

08:11.258 --> 08:13.124
What? What?
Cathy, what's wrong?

08:13.126 --> 08:14.659
I-I... I-I...

08:14.661 --> 08:17.662
I... ah-ah-ah... ah...

08:17.664 --> 08:19.931
Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy,
when we got married,

08:19.933 --> 08:21.666
you used to speak for hours.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.935
But since we moved
to New York City, nothing!

08:23.937 --> 08:26.471
(audience laughing)
Wow. It all magically fits.

08:26.473 --> 08:29.274
Come on, Cathy,
say something! Anything!

08:29.276 --> 08:31.476
(Italian accent):
Fuggedaboutit!

08:31.478 --> 08:33.345

08:34.947 --> 08:37.282
And scene!

08:37.284 --> 08:40.018
<i>I</i> said "fear of

08:40.020 --> 08:42.988
Yes, you did. Very nice.
Return to your seat immediately.

08:42.990 --> 08:46.124
Wow. Wow. These guys
do everything I can't.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.659
Maybe they can teach me.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.961
I don't know that
they're interested in that.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.963
$500 for the first
eight classes.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.865
That's kind of expensive.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.801
Couldn't people just form
their own groups for free?

08:56.803 --> 08:58.703

<i>Don't you get it?</i>
<i>The secret to life</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:58.363
<i>has been right in front of you</i>
<i>all along:</i>

09:58.365 --> 10:00.899
<i>Don't be yourself!</i>

10:00.901 --> 10:02.901
Uh, uh, okay.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.903
What am I bid for this noose?

10:04.905 --> 10:05.904
Do hear $100?

10:05.906 --> 10:06.905
No?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.273
Going... going...

10:08.275 --> 10:09.374
(chokes)

10:09.376 --> 10:11.943
(laughter)

10:11.945 --> 10:15.113
That's great! Really took
my mind off my sick grandmother.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.615
(electronic chime)
Oh.

10:16.617 --> 10:19.017
Looks like the hospital
left a message.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.120
(voice breaking):
Gotta go.
HOMER: See ya!

10:22.122 --> 10:23.888
(laughing):
It made me laugh.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.590
So, then, you pay me?
No, never!

10:25.592 --> 10:28.226
And if you open your own school,
we'll break your legs!

10:28.228 --> 10:31.096
You want to give him the
one we can never crack?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.798
Queen of Norway buying a car.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.603
(high-pitched):
Oh, dear! I can't a-fjord it!

10:38.605 --> 10:40.905
A star is born.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.309
(grunting)

10:44.311 --> 10:45.944
Excuse me.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.979
I'm from the city.
Are you aware that you live

10:47.981 --> 10:50.281
in a historical treehouse
preservation district?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.484
♪

10:58.758 --> 11:00.425
May I see your permits?

11:00.427 --> 11:01.993
I don't have permits.

11:01.995 --> 11:02.927
(screams)

11:02.929 --> 11:03.928
Don't worry.

11:03.930 --> 11:04.929
D-Don't worry.

11:04.931 --> 11:05.930
I'll take care of it.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.033
(grunting)

11:11.003 --> 11:12.804
I've got to hand it
to you, Dad.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.773
You went from
fear of public speaking

11:14.775 --> 11:17.475
to starting
your own improv troupe.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.977
Improv is exciting,

11:18.979 --> 11:20.979
but totally safe.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.814
Like driving a helicopter
on the ground.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.015
Um, that's not safe.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.350
Don't deny the premise.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.851
That's anti-improv.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.621
Note for new character,
"Auntie Improv."

11:29.623 --> 11:32.157
(high-pitched):
May I hear a suggestion?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.459
People, don't freak out,

11:34.461 --> 11:37.462
but the improv critic from the
<i>Springfield Shopper</i>

11:37.464 --> 11:39.130
is in the audience.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.132
(gasps)
Steve Thurlson?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.501
No, Thurlson is
their improv reporter.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.036
Grant Hood is
their improv critic.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.138
Then who's Jennifer Whitehead?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.840
Oh, she writes
improv think pieces.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.308
You know, trends,
big picture stuff.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.810
Who does the top ten list

11:51.812 --> 11:53.812
at end-of-year
"Best of Improv" issue?

11:53.814 --> 11:54.879
They each write their own.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.381
(all murmuring assent)
Oh, yeah.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.982
I forgot about that.
That's true.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.051
Huh!

12:00.053 --> 12:01.386
(piano riff playing)

12:01.388 --> 12:03.054
(applause)

12:03.056 --> 12:04.823
Hi, everybody.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.658
We are "Premises, Premises."

12:06.660 --> 12:10.895
Yes, it says on Google that
there are 5,012 improv groups

12:10.897 --> 12:12.997
with that name.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.232
LENNY:
Take it, Homer.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.902
(nervously):
Uh, okay, I need a location.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.572
Uh, Jackson Square
in New Orleans.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.374
And a type of person
that might be there.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.343
Someone with confidence.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.078
Mm, I...

12:27.080 --> 12:29.013
(Cajun accent):
I ga-ron-tee it!

12:29.015 --> 12:32.083
(applause and cheering)

12:33.185 --> 12:34.853
So, Tuesday is the
treehouse warming.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.721
Nelson's gonna
show us his mom's bra.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.056
(gasps)

12:38.058 --> 12:39.891
That's the thing
that boobs touch.

12:39.893 --> 12:43.428
Whoa, automatic blinds.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.029
Yeah, I think my
mom put those in.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.030
No need to thank her.

12:46.032 --> 12:46.998
She's just doing her job.

12:48.567 --> 12:49.934
(grunts)

12:53.539 --> 12:55.940
The Keebler Elves are real!

12:56.442 --> 12:58.243
Pass the gravy, Bart.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.544
Yo.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.879
Thank you.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.547
Geez, who ordered the crab?

13:02.549 --> 13:03.882
(gasps)
There's crab?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.049
There's no crab.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.752
There's no "thank you's",
no appreciation.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.154
Nothing.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.391
Uh, who was that directed at?

13:13.393 --> 13:14.559
Bart!

13:14.561 --> 13:16.628
Whew!
Pass the gravy, please.

13:17.897 --> 13:18.963
(phone chimes)

13:18.965 --> 13:21.733
(gasps)
Dad! Dad!

13:21.735 --> 13:25.069
The Springfield Fringe Festival
just invited us to perform.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.238
Huh? What's a "Fringe Festival"?

13:27.240 --> 13:29.941
My guess would be it's a
three-day series of performances

13:29.943 --> 13:31.810
by alternative
comedy and music acts,

13:31.812 --> 13:33.311
including, but not limited to,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.947
improv, stand-up, light circus
work and ironic burlesque.

13:35.949 --> 13:39.250
We're gonna be on the
main stage on closing night!

13:39.252 --> 13:40.752
This is going in my log.

13:40.754 --> 13:41.753
Yay!

13:41.755 --> 13:43.922
(chuckles)
More crab for me.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.824
MARGE:
There's no crab!

13:45.826 --> 13:47.091
Mm!

13:47.093 --> 13:48.827
(humming happily)

13:48.829 --> 13:49.594
(grunts, slurps)

13:49.596 --> 13:51.596
Mmm!

13:51.598 --> 13:55.300
(Marge grunting)

13:55.302 --> 13:57.168
Aw, Marge,
don't take it to heart.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.470
Kids are ungrateful,
that's their job.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.273
You can cheer up watching me
at the Fringe Festival.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.808
Good for you.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.811
The main stage, closing night,
all eyes on you.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.313
Wh-Wh-Wh-What...
what are you saying?

14:08.315 --> 14:11.182
<i>Oh, she's making me</i>
<i>nervous again.</i>

14:11.184 --> 14:12.984
<i>But now I'm a trained</i>
<i>comedy amateur.</i>

14:12.986 --> 14:14.452
<i>No one can get in my head.</i>

14:14.454 --> 14:16.321
<i>Marge Simpson,</i>

14:16.323 --> 14:19.958
<i>you don't want to accidentally</i>
<i>undermine him like last time.</i>

14:19.960 --> 14:22.493
<i>Oh, thank God he doesn't know</i>
<i>what I'm thinking.</i>

14:22.495 --> 14:24.495
<i>I know exactly</i>
<i>what she's thinking.</i>

14:24.497 --> 14:27.298
<i>That if I mess this up,</i>
<i>I'll be worse off than ever.</i>

14:27.300 --> 14:28.299
<i>He does know.</i>

14:28.301 --> 14:29.534
<i>She knows I know!</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:30.201
<i>(Homer and Marge scream)</i>

14:35.808 --> 14:37.041
Homer?
(muffled):
Aw, what?

14:37.043 --> 14:39.143
I slept on it, and
I'm madder than ever.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.211
Go get Bart.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.512
Oh my God, Marge,

14:41.514 --> 14:43.481
you woke up with
morning-would-be-mad.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.984
Okay, I'll put this
in your new language.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.886
Location: Bart's room.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.054
Action: bring him here.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.222
Can I get
a character, please?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.657
Fine. Um...

14:52.659 --> 14:54.893
A near-sighted Frankenstein.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.227
Okay.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.898
(growling)

14:59.900 --> 15:02.667
Bride! Bride!

15:02.669 --> 15:05.169
I do not look like
the Bride of Frankenstein.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.171
(as monster):
Don't deny premise.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.339
(growls)

15:08.341 --> 15:11.743
(knocking on door)

15:11.745 --> 15:12.844
(grunts)

15:12.846 --> 15:15.413
BART:
Mom, can I come in?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.016
You like your eggs
a little runny don't you?
What?

15:18.018 --> 15:20.518
And your toast set at four,
with a little bit of butter?

15:20.520 --> 15:21.853
Yeah!

15:21.855 --> 15:24.355
Hash browns might
be a little burnt.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.258
I like 'em however
you make 'em, sweetie.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.893
I just wanted to say

15:28.895 --> 15:30.361
I'm sorry.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.864
We all forget just how many
wonderful things you do.

15:32.866 --> 15:33.865
Oh...

15:33.867 --> 15:35.066
(gasps)

15:35.068 --> 15:38.036
(voice-breaking):
Y-You're making me cry.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.203
(sobs)
And best of all,

15:39.205 --> 15:42.040
you're as hot
as the day I met you.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.041
(sobs)

15:43.043 --> 15:44.776
Thank you!

15:44.778 --> 15:48.579
That apology speech you wrote
worked like a charm, Pop.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.581
Your mother can't resist
an apology

15:50.583 --> 15:52.617
that comes
straight from the heart...

15:52.619 --> 15:53.952
of this box.

15:57.056 --> 15:58.589
Oh, dear God,

15:58.591 --> 16:01.559
this is not a
Renaissance Faire, is it?

16:01.561 --> 16:02.894
Uh, that's in two weeks,

16:02.896 --> 16:05.063
Henry the Weight Problem. Ha!

16:05.065 --> 16:08.733
Gee, I don't know if I belong
here with all this talent.

16:08.735 --> 16:09.968
(in goofy voice):
Hey, Reverend.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.103
Why didn't the dinosaurs
make it on Noah's Ark?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.571
(in normal voice):
Ooh, I give up.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.473
(in goofy voice):
Because they didn't exist.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.841
(laughter)

16:22.614 --> 16:25.917
Dad, this festival
encourages experimentation.

16:25.919 --> 16:26.985
Even failure.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.953
Oh, what if I don't fail?

16:28.955 --> 16:30.989
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.657
I am getting a helium balloon.

16:32.659 --> 16:33.992
That makes anyone funny.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.094
(in high helium voice):
Be right back!

16:36.096 --> 16:38.496
(Homer retching)

16:38.498 --> 16:40.932
Homer, are you okay?

16:40.934 --> 16:44.268
You look exactly like
Barbara Streisand did in 1967.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.437
I can't think of anything funny.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.506
Homer, Homer, relax,
you're a riot.

16:48.508 --> 16:52.110
Remember how funny you was when
you was the confident Cajun?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.178
Look, just let me
feed you the prompt.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.647
Wait, you mean cheat at improv?

16:56.649 --> 16:58.182
What would Del Close say?

16:58.184 --> 17:01.285
He would say, "Do like Moe
says, and shut the hell up."

17:01.287 --> 17:03.121
Who's Del Close?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.624
Only the author of the best book
I intend to read someday.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.127
Homer, the cemeteries
are filled with people

17:09.129 --> 17:10.962
who <i>didn't</i> cheat at improv.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.730
Hmm...

17:19.004 --> 17:21.639
Okay, let's go over what you're
gonna call out one more time.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.474
Uh, ethnicity: Cajun.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.143
Location: back alley.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.477
Good, good.

17:26.479 --> 17:27.979
The back alley Cajun bit.

17:27.981 --> 17:29.313
LISA:
Dad!

17:29.315 --> 17:32.316
Are you cheating by
planting suggestions?

17:32.318 --> 17:32.984
Maybe.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.685
(stunned gasp)

17:34.687 --> 17:37.021
Have you learned nothing
from owning an unread copy

17:37.023 --> 17:38.556
of <i>Truth in Comedy?</i>

17:38.558 --> 17:40.491
It's either that
or quit the show.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.493
You can't let
your troupe down.

17:42.495 --> 17:45.229
They need your space work,
your strong choices,

17:45.231 --> 17:47.065
and scene-building skills.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.900
Hey, lay off your dad, huh?

17:48.902 --> 17:51.002
Everything that's
supposedly spontaneous

17:51.004 --> 17:52.570
has already been planned, okay?

17:52.572 --> 17:55.706
Reality shows, uh,
lip-sync singing, even...

17:55.708 --> 17:57.175
(in dramatic voice):
awards shows.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.376
No!

17:58.378 --> 18:01.012
Yes, that's why the losers
don't show up.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.014
B-b-b-but they have
scheduling conflicts.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.082
Yeah, right.

18:04.084 --> 18:07.018
Dave Franco has a
scheduling conflict.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.553
No, no, I've heard enough.

18:08.555 --> 18:12.090
I refuse to use
performance enhancing "sugs."

18:14.026 --> 18:15.093
AUDIENCE (muttering):
It's Homer Simpson.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.694
Homer Simpson's here.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.563
(audience continues to
mutter in excitement)

18:18.565 --> 18:20.865
Okay, everyone,
I'm Homer Simpson

18:20.867 --> 18:22.700
and I need an occupation.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.035
Cadaver salesman?

18:24.037 --> 18:26.037
Drive-thru cashier.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.738
Uh, frog gigger.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.040
Finger kisser! Mwah!

18:29.042 --> 18:30.041
Nurse.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.876
You'll have to be more specific.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.878
I need a nurse!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.379
Back alley Cajun!

18:35.381 --> 18:36.380
Mm-hmm!

18:36.382 --> 18:37.748
Ah...

18:37.750 --> 18:40.051
A father I can look up to.

18:40.053 --> 18:43.054
Oh. Um, uh...

18:43.056 --> 18:45.957
I hear... drive-thru cashier!

18:45.959 --> 18:47.758
BOTH:
You wha... ?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.128
Hello, welcome to
"Down and Out Burger"

18:50.130 --> 18:51.095
Would you like fries with that?

18:51.097 --> 18:52.563
(laughter)
A thousand?

18:52.565 --> 18:54.966
Sure thing, Mr. Brando.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.268
By the way, this is 1992.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.803
(Homer chuckles,
audience laughs)

19:04.143 --> 19:06.244
And now we're gonna do
something a little special.

19:06.246 --> 19:10.081
Our father is going to improv
live answers to questions

19:10.083 --> 19:11.582
from the TV audience.

19:11.584 --> 19:16.087
It only took us 27 years to do
what they could do in 1954.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.989
Homer, time to bomb.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.758
Hello!
I've gathered you here

19:20.760 --> 19:22.326
because I have
an important announcement.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.596
This is the last episode
of   <i>The Simpsons.</i>

19:25.598 --> 19:26.931
It's been a good run--

19:26.933 --> 19:28.132
Ah, just kidding!

19:28.134 --> 19:29.834
<i>The Simpsons</i> will never end!

19:29.836 --> 19:31.269
But I do have bad news.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.670
If you're seeing this,

19:32.672 --> 19:35.173
something has gone
horribly, horribly wrong.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.341
Or you're watching
the international version.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.444
In either case,
I have three minutes to fill,

19:40.446 --> 19:43.114
and I can think of no better way
to fill that time

19:43.116 --> 19:47.118
than to throw my hat into
the ring for U.S. president.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.786
I have no previous experience,

19:48.788 --> 19:50.121
no endorsements,

19:50.123 --> 19:52.123
and no idea
when the election is.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.458
That makes me
the most qualified.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.127
By far.

19:56.129 --> 19:58.963
I can beat Trump and Clinton
and Sanders.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.966
Stupid Sanders.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.367
I will make America great again,

20:03.369 --> 20:05.036
then not so great.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.638
I will keep you on your toes.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.340
I will not run
for a second term.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.142
I will walk.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.476
I will drill, baby drill,

20:12.478 --> 20:15.146
until I find
the river of chocolate

20:15.148 --> 20:17.982
that lies beneath
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.985
I will not only
leave Gitmo open,

20:20.987 --> 20:23.821
I will open Gitmo's tavern.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.692
I believe that no one,
whatever his or her gender,

20:27.694 --> 20:30.828
should have to use
the bathroom after I do.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.663
I am a winner!

20:32.665 --> 20:34.865
If the superdelegates
oppose me,

20:34.867 --> 20:37.535
I will destroy them
with kryptonite.

20:37.537 --> 20:41.339
I plan to win on the first,
second and third ballots.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.907
Maybe take a breather
on the fourth,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.843
and come back strong
on the fifth.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.046
And I'll get rid of
the boring Olympic events...

20:49.048 --> 20:51.015
like all of them.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.251
I will increase
American exports,

20:53.253 --> 20:55.886
(Bart belches)
starting with my two stupid
sister-in-laws.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.421
Uh...

20:57.423 --> 20:59.557
sister-in-laws...?

20:59.559 --> 21:02.860
Let's just call 'em
"American Uglies."

21:02.862 --> 21:05.029
Soon to be "Canadian Sevens."

21:05.031 --> 21:06.931
I would also like to apologize

21:06.933 --> 21:10.034
for the horrible thing
I just said about Canada.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.103
And so, I withdraw.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.739
I throw my endorsement
to Jeb Bush,

21:14.741 --> 21:16.540
and I trust it's not too late.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.708
In conclusion,

21:17.710 --> 21:19.043
God bless America,

21:19.045 --> 21:20.945
and God bless Springfield,

21:20.947 --> 21:22.246

21:22.248 --> 21:24.282
