00:27.960 --> 00:29.610
JUNE 1905, -

00:29.611 --> 00:34.027
THE PARLIAMENT DISSOLVES THE UNION
BETWEEN SWEDEN AND NORWAY.

00:34.028 --> 00:38.731
THAT SAME YEAR, THE PEOPLE DECIDE
FOR THE CONTINUITY OF THE MONARCHY.

00:38.732 --> 00:43.484
PRINCE CARL, OF DENMARK,
IS CHOSEN AS KING OF NORWAY.

00:45.701 --> 00:50.397
THE POLITICAL POWER WILL RESIDE WITH
THE GOVERNMENT AND PARLIAMENT.

00:50.398 --> 00:54.519
THE KING WILL JUST HAVE
A REPRESENTATIVE ROLE.

00:55.900 --> 00:57.650
NOVEMBER 1905,

00:57.651 --> 01:01.910
THE YOUNG PRINCE ARRIVES
AS KING HAAKON VII, OF NORWAY,

01:01.911 --> 01:04.992
TOGETHER WITH HIS ENGLISH
WIFE, QUEEN MAUD.

01:04.992 --> 01:08.073
IN HIS ARMS, HE CARRIES
THEIR ONLY SON,

01:08.074 --> 01:10.349
CROWN PRINCE OLAV.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.620
Got you!

04:44.300 --> 04:46.689
Grandpa, let go!

04:47.230 --> 04:50.892
Can you help me?
Could you find the girls?

04:55.650 --> 04:58.575
- Here they are!
- You cheated!

04:59.230 --> 05:02.755
- You got caught first. You're it.
- He was only helping an old man.

05:02.756 --> 05:06.537
- I want to hide again.
- That's not the rule.

05:06.538 --> 05:12.463
- Rules are stupid.
- Listen... I'm it again. Ok?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.411
Ten!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.471
- Ragnhild, come quickly!
- Nine!

05:18.190 --> 05:22.447
- Father... are you here?
- Eight!

05:25.210 --> 05:26.985
Seven!

05:26.986 --> 05:31.169
- Has anything happen?
- I just wanted to see the kids.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.900
- So you haven't heard?

05:34.901 --> 05:38.305
The ship that was torpedoed
outside Lillesand this morning.

05:39.270 --> 05:44.309
A dozen people rescued.
All are German soldiers.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.479
They're here, dad.
They are here now.

05:50.130 --> 05:52.536
And the Prime Minister
does not want to go against -

05:52.537 --> 05:54.757
- his own Foreign Minister.

05:54.758 --> 05:56.725
- Nygaardsvold is strong enough.

05:56.726 --> 06:00.504
He won't negotiate with anyone.

06:00.505 --> 06:03.445
There is no mobilization,
everything depends on Koth.

06:03.446 --> 06:08.948
And what do you want me to do?
Say "The King commands"?

06:08.949 --> 06:11.102
Show them how far we
are willing to go.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.705
Five!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.765
And how far is that?

06:16.620 --> 06:19.779
How far are you willing to go?

06:19.780 --> 06:23.129
Our opinions should
mean something.

06:23.130 --> 06:27.291
Let's watch it all without
lifting a finger. Is it the plan?

06:32.150 --> 06:34.383
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.738
Nico is on the phone.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.133
Are you freezing? Won't you
come in and get warm?

06:49.240 --> 06:53.024
The children wanted to be out...
Four!

06:53.210 --> 06:56.679
And you need to go see the
doctor about your back soon.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.565
- What do you mean?
- Your back.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.499
With all that's happening.

07:06.100 --> 07:10.120
We can't be on the
wrong side in this war.

07:28.685 --> 07:33.189
THE KING'S CHOICE

07:47.207 --> 07:51.116
APRIL 8, 22:00
THE GERMAN EMBASSY, OSLO

07:57.120 --> 08:02.371
- News from Norsk Telegrambyrå.
- Anneliese, the news!

08:03.100 --> 08:05.280
She's asleep soon.
The news...

08:05.281 --> 08:10.389
As announced by British
broadcasting this morning, -

08:10.390 --> 08:12.595
- French and English warships -

08:12.596 --> 08:17.189
- have laid three minefields
in Norwegian waters, -

08:17.190 --> 08:22.023
- at Stad, Bud by Hustadvika
and in Vestfjorden.

08:22.024 --> 08:25.115
Reuters have it confirmed
from London today, -

08:25.116 --> 08:29.079
that the operation was
completed in one hour.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.684
- What is he saying?

08:34.409 --> 08:37.453
- That France and England
have mined the coast -

08:37.453 --> 08:40.229
- to prevent shipping of ore.

08:41.110 --> 08:43.821
Only that? I can not
imagine the Norwegians...

08:45.760 --> 08:50.100
- 90 to 100 German warships
were spotted -

08:50.101 --> 08:54.488
- in Storebælt and Kattegat,
heading north.

08:55.140 --> 08:58.400
- Mostly armed trawlers
and defence ships,

08:58.401 --> 09:01.080
- but also large warships.

09:01.081 --> 09:04.925
- Reports from Stockholm
state around 50 warships.

09:04.926 --> 09:09.093
APRIL 8, 23:30
FORTRESS OSCARSBORG - 28KM SOUTH OF OSLO

09:22.080 --> 09:26.060
Colonel, foreign ships
are pushing through Færder.

09:26.061 --> 09:29.180
Rauøy and Bolærne are reporting
they are fighting.

09:29.181 --> 09:31.362
Turn off all lights at the fort.

09:32.430 --> 09:35.862
Ask the Superintendent in Drøbak -

09:35.863 --> 09:39.019
- to evacuate everybody from
Hallangspollen to Hvidsten.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.639
- We only have crew enough
for cannon 1.

09:41.640 --> 09:46.150
- Spread them across both cannons,
and call all non-combatants.

09:46.151 --> 09:49.443
- We have not heard from Oslo.

09:49.444 --> 09:52.169
- Nobody has made any decision.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.150
- We don't have orders
to shoot, Colonel.

09:58.180 --> 10:03.110
- I want everyone available and
ready to fight. Now.

10:07.190 --> 10:11.391
- So here we are, in Oslo. No war.

10:12.080 --> 10:17.040
- I have my post and get my orders
from Berlin, but we are here.

10:17.041 --> 10:20.120
- I don't know what else I can...

10:31.150 --> 10:33.428
- Heil Hitler!

10:34.300 --> 10:35.935
Ambassador...

10:37.530 --> 10:41.230
- The time has come.
- For what?

10:43.729 --> 10:49.405
APRIL 9, 00:00
ROYAL PALACE, OSLO.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.665
I'm waiting to speak with
my brother, King Christian.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.877
Yes... but then you
need to find him!

11:06.700 --> 11:11.675
Yes, I'll wait! I've
been waiting for 15 minutes.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.293
Your Majesty,
Minister Koht phoned.

11:17.294 --> 11:21.573
He asked me to inform you that foreign
warships have entered the Oslo fjord.

11:23.130 --> 11:26.609
Your Majesty, we should
go to the basement.

11:27.190 --> 11:31.106
No... I will not be a
prisoner in my own home.

11:35.230 --> 11:38.875
Larsen! Binoculars for Eriksen.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.569
The only thing you will do is
to give them this pen,

12:15.570 --> 12:19.119
- so they can sign the agreement
of voluntary cooperation.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.219
Keep it.

12:21.220 --> 12:24.436
They will see this
as an aggression.

12:26.060 --> 12:29.179
Then you need to convince
them that it is not.

12:29.180 --> 12:32.419
They have sacrificed a lot
to maintain neutrality.

12:32.420 --> 12:38.110
Norway is the main target,
because of the shoreline.

12:38.111 --> 12:40.544
And not least because
of of iron ore.

12:41.190 --> 12:45.536
The resources we can get by
occupying of Norway are immeasurable.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.429
Prepare to load!

13:01.100 --> 13:03.081
Come on, push it.

13:05.130 --> 13:08.317
Load it in the barrel. Faster!

13:10.520 --> 13:13.248
Colonel,
cannons 1 and 2 are both ready.

13:13.249 --> 13:14.549
Good.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.934
Filtvet is reporting a
ship with its lights off.

13:24.935 --> 13:27.229
They think it was German.

13:27.230 --> 13:31.933
They couldn't see that.
Not even on a clear night.

13:33.190 --> 13:36.739
Getting the spotlight up
is urgent, Sødem!

13:40.640 --> 13:42.226
Good.

14:06.306 --> 14:11.030
APRIL 9, 04:20
MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, OSLO.

14:26.180 --> 14:28.856
Good evening, Minister Koht.

14:29.775 --> 14:31.153
Mr. Bräuer.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.502
On behalf of the German leader,

14:34.503 --> 14:39.170
I bring this offer to the
Norwegian government.

14:55.110 --> 14:57.689
What is this, Ambassador?

14:57.690 --> 15:02.929
We have come to defend Norway
against a British invasion.

15:02.930 --> 15:07.704
And expect in return
that there is no resistance.

15:08.920 --> 15:13.939
I know that a Foreign Affairs
Minister and an Ambassador -

15:13.940 --> 15:16.618
- can make that deal,
here and now.

15:20.230 --> 15:22.904
I need to discuss this
with the government.

15:22.905 --> 15:24.723
Then I will wait.

15:26.140 --> 15:28.966
The government is here,
next door.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.085
Commander Andersen wants
a categorical order -

16:12.086 --> 16:17.409
- about whether to fire torpedoes
at the approaching ships.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.963
Kopås is reporting silhouettes
of several large ships.

16:29.210 --> 16:30.903
Colonel?

16:33.210 --> 16:35.794
- Færder and Bolærne is
reporting fighting.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.562
- The ships are approaching at low
speed, with no lights.

16:39.563 --> 16:43.284
They are warships,
so damn right we will shoot!

16:43.285 --> 16:46.370
All ready!

16:51.080 --> 16:52.757
This war...

16:54.240 --> 16:56.989
- between Germany and England.

16:59.130 --> 17:03.006
It will become the most
meaningless war you can imagine.

17:05.730 --> 17:08.977
It can only end in
mutual destruction.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.196
Sødem! The distance!

18:11.080 --> 18:14.891
- Sødem?
- The orograph says 1800 meters.

18:14.892 --> 18:18.371
Too far! They are just
passing Småskjær.

18:18.372 --> 18:20.226
- Let's wait for
confirmation from Kopås.

18:20.227 --> 18:22.537
- No time. Set to 1,200 meters!

18:22.538 --> 18:26.356
- 1,200 meters and decreasing!

18:28.230 --> 18:32.354
- Warning shots?
- No warning. They are enemies.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.180
- 1,200 meters!

18:37.230 --> 18:39.552
- Cannon 2 is following the target!

18:42.140 --> 18:45.309
- But Colonel... What
if we make a mistake?

18:47.060 --> 18:48.819
- At my command!

18:50.240 --> 18:53.359
- Fire!
- Cannon 1, fire!

19:01.060 --> 19:04.385
- Fire!
- Cannon 2, fire!

19:34.990 --> 19:37.347
Where are the torpedoes, Sødem?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.993
Torpedo battery, quick!

20:12.240 --> 20:15.427
Norway is an
independent nation.

20:16.130 --> 20:20.978
It would cease to be if we
accepted the German demands.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.509
Therefore, our answer is "no".

20:27.240 --> 20:29.713
They know what this entails...

20:32.130 --> 20:35.019
Your own leader have said:

20:35.020 --> 20:38.947
"A people surrendering
to a foreign attack,"

20:38.948 --> 20:41.205
"does not deserve to live."

20:42.220 --> 20:46.197
We will not bow
down voluntarily.

20:55.230 --> 21:00.332
Your Majesty, pardon. The Prime
Minister on the telephone.

21:01.190 --> 21:03.101
Thank you.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.140
The power is back, Thank God.

21:14.597 --> 21:16.732
Speak louder, Nygaardsvold.

21:16.733 --> 21:21.233
We have been invaded!
An attack was repelled, but -

21:21.234 --> 21:26.000
- President of Parliament Hambro
thinks it's best to leave the city.

21:26.001 --> 21:29.490
A special train will depart
from Østbanen at 07:00.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.397
APRIL 9, 06:20. OSLO.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.141
Are you ready?

21:58.020 --> 22:00.352
The cars are waiting, dad.
We have to go.

22:03.150 --> 22:06.872
- Is there more?
- Yes, yes!

22:13.070 --> 22:14.488
Come on.

22:29.090 --> 22:30.985
The Lord Chamberlain,
Wedel Jarlsberg -

22:30.986 --> 22:33.374
- will join Your
Majesty on the train.

22:34.711 --> 22:36.263
Are you not coming?

22:36.264 --> 22:38.998
I'll stay until
Your Majesty leaves.

22:38.999 --> 22:42.310
- Then I'll report for service.
- That's good.

22:43.530 --> 22:47.799
- Where are the children?
- In the car. Everyone is here.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.629
I forgot my glasses.

22:49.630 --> 22:52.462
I put them in your
suitcase, Your Majesty.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.181
I forgot my diary, too.

22:55.182 --> 22:58.256
Also in the suitcase,
Your Majesty.

22:59.060 --> 23:00.743
Father...

23:02.170 --> 23:04.267
I have to go to the toilet.

23:39.110 --> 23:42.245
Just because we leave now,
doesn't mean we won't be back.

24:33.060 --> 24:36.437
- Good morning, Torp.
- Your Majesty.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.525
Although not actually
a good morning.

24:40.190 --> 24:45.766
Due to the situation, an
extra train is set up at Hamar.

24:50.190 --> 24:55.521
- Grandpa!
- Hey, little buddy, you came!

24:58.020 --> 25:02.742
Let's move.
It's the second carriage.

25:38.110 --> 25:41.979
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Peder. It's good to see you.

25:41.980 --> 25:43.541
Likewise.

25:45.090 --> 25:48.946
- Peder, how's it going?
- Your Highness, glad you came.

25:50.170 --> 25:54.907
- Dad, why did not Ording come?
- He wants to join the service.

25:56.170 --> 25:59.295
- Hi, Peder.
- Your Highness.

26:00.110 --> 26:02.537
Looks like children are ok.

26:02.538 --> 26:04.940
Yes, they think we're going
to the cabin.

26:04.941 --> 26:07.755
The important thing is that
the family is together.

26:07.756 --> 26:09.238
Did you hear anything, Peder?

26:09.239 --> 26:13.029
I spoke to the Foreign Minister.

26:13.030 --> 26:17.203
German ships have been reported
in all major ports.

26:17.204 --> 26:19.139
Across the country.

26:19.140 --> 26:24.163
Is there any diplomatic contact?
Is it possible to negotiate?

26:24.164 --> 26:26.004
I think we should trust that -

26:26.005 --> 26:29.996
this will be solved by Koht
and the Government, Olav.

26:29.997 --> 26:32.675
I agree.

26:32.676 --> 26:37.635
Your Majesty and family
must not lose your freedom.

26:37.636 --> 26:40.647
But do we know that
this is an occupation?

26:40.648 --> 26:42.631
The Government is holding
a special meeting -

26:42.632 --> 26:44.599
- as soon as we get to Hamar.

26:44.600 --> 26:49.022
Everyone is on the way, some by
car, others here on the train.

26:49.023 --> 26:53.020
The President of Parliament
is controlling everything.

26:53.021 --> 26:58.256
I suggest we trust him.
Hambro knows what he's doing.

26:58.257 --> 27:01.509
He seems to be the only one with
the head on right at this moment.

27:05.240 --> 27:10.200
Away from the windows! On the floor!
Everyone, please.

27:10.201 --> 27:13.054
- What's happening?
- Quickly. Air planes.

27:13.055 --> 27:17.180
- Together, on the floor.
- Children! Olav...

27:20.060 --> 27:21.829
Where are they?

27:21.830 --> 27:23.865
There...

27:40.160 --> 27:42.504
The kids are ok.

27:44.110 --> 27:46.195
Everyone off the train. Now.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.359
- All right.
- Straight away, come on.

27:53.390 --> 27:56.160
- Here, Your Majesty.
- The children?

27:56.161 --> 27:58.108
I'll take that ...

28:13.100 --> 28:16.499
- Run! Run!
- That way!

28:18.010 --> 28:21.281
Everyone to the underground!

28:32.100 --> 28:34.225
Your Majesty, come on.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.223
Calm... everything is fine.

29:33.140 --> 29:36.761
Diana, contact Minister Koht.

29:37.180 --> 29:40.999
Say we need to talk
about further negotiations.

29:42.200 --> 29:46.271
No one thought to tell
me about this plan?

29:46.272 --> 29:50.014
There is nothing wrong with the plan.
It's from Führer himself!

29:57.190 --> 30:01.318
- How did it go?
- Good. Why?

30:02.130 --> 30:05.035
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

30:05.036 --> 30:07.734
Diana, what about Koth?

30:11.050 --> 30:13.205
He wasn't there.
The Government has left.

30:13.206 --> 30:16.555
- What? Where?
- They did not say.

30:27.140 --> 30:28.961
Wait here.

30:33.090 --> 30:38.349
Please don't touch this.
Excuse me. Don't go up.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.551
Glad you got the piglet.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.733
I can't hear.
What is he saying?

30:58.180 --> 31:02.904
He says he wants to go home.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.584
I want that also.

31:08.585 --> 31:12.404
Tell him we'll be home soon.

31:12.405 --> 31:15.270
We'll get home soon...

31:18.210 --> 31:22.256
- Did he say anything?
- He said "Yes, sir!".

31:24.800 --> 31:26.665
Does he speak another language?

31:27.881 --> 31:30.841
Dooes he speak other
languages or only English?

31:31.230 --> 31:35.673
He speaks Danish, Swedish, -

31:35.674 --> 31:38.009
- English and Norwegian.

31:38.010 --> 31:40.172
Danish, Swedish,
English and Norwegian?

31:40.173 --> 31:41.673
And the language of the pigs.

31:41.674 --> 31:47.151
Language of the pigs too?
I didn't think he would.

32:10.969 --> 32:14.523
APRIL 9, 23:10. HAMAR STATION.
126KM NORTH OF OSLO.

32:21.060 --> 32:25.639
Nygaardsvold!
Can I take a picture?

32:28.140 --> 32:30.285
Your Majesty, welcome to Hamar.

32:30.286 --> 32:34.637
Thank you. Prime Minister.
Hambro.

32:34.638 --> 32:37.492
- Your Majesty, I heard that
the trip was troubled.

32:37.493 --> 32:39.558
- You can say that yes.

32:39.559 --> 32:42.448
- President. The trip
was well organized.

32:42.449 --> 32:46.220
- Thank you, welcome.
- Any news?

32:47.000 --> 32:50.136
The Germans control most
of the large cities.

32:50.137 --> 32:52.230
Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.598
The ministry is evacuated.

32:54.599 --> 32:58.049
Most are sent home,
others are coming here.

32:58.050 --> 33:02.150
We're trying to take control.
I'll know more soon.

33:02.953 --> 33:06.353
Did Oscarsborg sink a big war
ship on its way to Oslo?

33:06.354 --> 33:11.322
Yes, they saved us, but the
fort is under air raid.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.116
We have to accept
that Oslo is lost.

33:15.140 --> 33:17.291
Where do we stand with the army?

33:17.292 --> 33:20.425
We have sent orders
for mobilization.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.347
- How?
- By letter.

33:24.348 --> 33:28.245
- By letter?
- We were caught by surprise.

33:28.246 --> 33:33.220
Surprise?
You think this is surprising?

33:34.000 --> 33:39.429
I want to emphasize that our
belief in neutrality remains clear.

33:39.430 --> 33:43.229
We are confident that new
negotiations will come.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.593
What if they don't come?

33:44.594 --> 33:48.540
- They will come.
I'm gathering the Parliament.

33:50.170 --> 33:53.763
I know the German
Ambassador, Curt Bräuer.

33:53.764 --> 33:58.020
He is a supporter of
Norwegian neutrality.

33:58.021 --> 34:02.621
- And we want to trade?
- The Parliament will discuss this now.

34:02.622 --> 34:05.910
We're staying in the city,
at the theatre.

34:12.219 --> 34:17.239
I have other news that
might be heavy for you.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.320
Your brother, King Christian, -

34:20.321 --> 34:22.768
- surrendered Denmark
at 05:00 this morning.

34:27.070 --> 34:30.190
If it helps, he did
not have much choice.

34:30.192 --> 34:32.784
No, he probably didn't.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.330
- "Surprised", did you hear that?

34:57.331 --> 35:01.607
Our negotiation cards are terrible -

35:02.110 --> 35:06.266
- because they did not mobilize,
like I've asked for for ages.

35:06.267 --> 35:10.050
- Let the Government make
their proposal.

35:10.051 --> 35:13.819
- But we have to be able to
negotiate on our own terms!

35:17.240 --> 35:19.779
Let me speak with General Laake.

35:19.780 --> 35:23.819
- Or Ruge.
Speed things up a little bit!

35:23.820 --> 35:25.762
- Have you gone crazy?

35:25.763 --> 35:29.986
- The Royal House trading
behind the Government's back?

35:33.150 --> 35:37.167
- Someo of the army
still listens to us.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.572
- We don't need a discord now.

35:40.160 --> 35:44.693
There are people in Parliament
who wants to get rid of us.

35:45.755 --> 35:49.209
So why are we here if they
don't want us -

35:49.210 --> 35:51.837
- and disagree with
everything they do?

35:51.838 --> 35:53.701
- Don't you understand anything?

35:54.240 --> 35:56.862
- You do everything so complicated!

36:45.200 --> 36:50.441
- Your Majesty. Sigrid Sælid.
Welcome to Sælid farm.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.765
- Thank you for receiving
us on such short notice.

36:52.766 --> 36:58.667
I need to get some rest. Can
I get a radio in the room?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.585
We'll arrange that.

37:20.020 --> 37:21.571
At ease!

37:35.730 --> 37:37.949
We've taken Oslo.

37:37.950 --> 37:41.472
All roads in and out.

37:41.473 --> 37:43.725
With less than 50 men.

37:43.726 --> 37:46.756
Good. It all went well?

37:50.190 --> 37:53.668
It was a massacre, ambassador.

37:56.230 --> 38:01.835
For our comrades on board
"Blücher", the pride of the Führer.

38:02.772 --> 38:05.670
The Government
escaped, do you know?

38:06.070 --> 38:10.391
We've come to protect the Norwegians,
and this is the way we are received.

38:10.392 --> 38:15.514
They would fight anyone.
To them, we are invaders.

38:15.515 --> 38:19.644
Let me negotiate. Contact the
Government before further lives are lost.

38:19.645 --> 38:23.160
When General Falkenhorst
arrives tomorrow, -

38:23.161 --> 38:27.281
- Norway must be in our hands, from
the King to the smallest farmer.

38:29.220 --> 38:32.073
I have the parachute troops ready.

38:32.074 --> 38:37.118
If today's negotiation fail, -

38:37.119 --> 38:39.099
- I'll put them in to action.

38:39.100 --> 38:42.372
Today? The Government
is in hiding...

38:42.373 --> 38:45.525
Then find them.
Or else we will find.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.220
Today, a state of emergency
was declared in Oslo.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.190
A total evacuation will occur
in Oslo and Aker, -

39:03.191 --> 39:05.660
- but no one should
travel to the areas -

39:05.661 --> 39:07.832
- around the Oslo fjord.

39:10.140 --> 39:15.220
Those who were notified ...

39:42.020 --> 39:45.888
Luggage: Only carry-on -

39:45.889 --> 39:51.180
- that will fits on top
or under the vehicle.

39:53.800 --> 39:57.264
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.

39:59.150 --> 40:01.985
Has the Government
made a decision?

40:02.750 --> 40:04.220
No.

40:05.230 --> 40:09.540
But I've made a personal
decision, Your Majesty.

40:42.050 --> 40:45.574
Your Majesty. President.

40:46.130 --> 40:48.713
A few moments ago -

40:49.731 --> 40:53.286
I handed over to His
Majesty, King Haakon VII, -

40:54.240 --> 40:59.060
- my resignation as Prime Minister, -

40:59.061 --> 41:03.180
- and at the same time, the
renouncement of this Government.

41:11.140 --> 41:15.080
I'll be brief, because
we have a lot to do.

41:15.081 --> 41:18.589
As the King of Norway, I
can do nothing more -

41:18.590 --> 41:23.110
- than to accept the resignation
of the Government.

41:26.020 --> 41:27.763
But not now.

41:28.432 --> 41:32.497
President of Parliament,
Hambro, has decided -

41:32.498 --> 41:37.468
- not to accept the resignation,
a decision that I support.

41:37.469 --> 41:42.229
This is not the time for negotiations
behind closed doors -

41:42.230 --> 41:46.150
- or agreements between
small groups.

41:46.151 --> 41:50.200
It's time to be open
with each other, -

41:50.201 --> 41:52.955
- and I will be totally
open with you.

41:55.050 --> 42:00.347
People chose you to lead them,

42:00.382 --> 42:04.180
both in light, and
in times of darkness.

42:04.181 --> 42:09.100
Therefore, the resignation of the
Government will not be accepted,

42:09.101 --> 42:12.328
- not when people so strongly -

42:12.329 --> 42:15.485
- need someone to lead them.

42:30.110 --> 42:34.919
Your Majesty, honourable
house, we will continue.

42:37.160 --> 42:41.750
The German envoy asked
to resume negotiations, -

42:41.751 --> 42:44.170
- based on documents sent
to us this morning,

42:44.171 --> 42:46.839
- to which we already said "no".

42:50.090 --> 42:55.295
It seems like more people are
convinced that the situation has changed.

42:55.296 --> 43:01.010
With the uncertainty that has spread,
misconceptions with the mobilization, -

43:01.011 --> 43:04.789
- and German forces in Oslo,
Bergen, Stavanger and Narvik, -

43:04.790 --> 43:08.628
- many think it's looking bleak.

43:11.090 --> 43:14.020
- I don't share this opinion.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.489
Despite this,
a majority still wants -

43:17.490 --> 43:21.029
- us to resume
negotiations immediately.

43:21.030 --> 43:24.382
- Negotiations about what?
- Your Highness?

43:26.000 --> 43:29.860
- I'm sorry, President. But what
has changed since last night?

43:31.080 --> 43:33.460
- I share the Parliament's opinion.

43:33.461 --> 43:37.129
- I am a man of trading.

43:37.130 --> 43:41.180
- But I must ask the
Government or Prime Minister:

43:41.181 --> 43:44.523
- What do you think has
changed since last night?

43:46.130 --> 43:50.095
- What do we have to offer?
- Minister Koht.

43:50.096 --> 43:52.457
- Your Highness. President.

43:52.458 --> 43:55.617
- Much have changed in
the last few hours.

43:56.510 --> 43:59.262
- We've lost control of large
part of the country.

43:59.263 --> 44:01.299
- We are under attack.

44:02.190 --> 44:04.861
- But we still have our freedom.

44:06.030 --> 44:09.789
- We have an independent Government
and the support of the people.

44:11.010 --> 44:14.209
- The Government wants to
continue negotiations,

44:14.800 --> 44:18.190
- in the hope of a cease fire.

44:18.191 --> 44:20.953
- If we get a solution, -

44:20.954 --> 44:24.700
- not unlike the one
Denmark said "yes" to,

44:25.240 --> 44:28.522
- then this Government
will be in favour of it.

44:28.523 --> 44:31.261
- It would save many lives.

44:42.080 --> 44:47.811
- If the Government wants to negotiate,
I will be happy to support.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.701
- The Prime Ministers resignation
was a gift from above.

45:03.702 --> 45:06.160
- Hambro could have lead us!

45:06.161 --> 45:10.090
- Instead we're sitting down with
a Government in dissolution.

45:10.091 --> 45:14.860
- Instead of criticizing all the time,
try to listen and learn something.

45:15.490 --> 45:19.998
- We have to stay together. We
have to support the Government.

45:20.370 --> 45:23.572
- This isn't about
your personal desire.

45:28.230 --> 45:30.581
- What do you actually need me for?

45:31.210 --> 45:35.789
- You will be the next King of Norway.
I need to behave as such.

45:35.790 --> 45:39.942
- We told them that
we needed to mobilize.

45:39.943 --> 45:43.129
- That the war would reach us.
And look now!

45:43.130 --> 45:48.000
- Don't be afraid to stand for something.
- Don't call me afraid -

45:48.001 --> 45:51.922
- just because I don't embark
on all your capricious plans.

45:53.090 --> 45:56.602
- We can't risk everything like this.
Don't you understand that?

45:58.230 --> 46:00.068
- Olav!

46:04.265 --> 46:07.633
APRIL 9, 18:40
MIDTSKOGEN - 27KM EAST OF HAMAR.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.966
Guys, unload!

46:31.180 --> 46:33.475
Line up!

46:46.200 --> 46:48.411
Here it is!

46:49.020 --> 46:52.184
- When you need something it's
always in the back.

47:01.210 --> 47:06.042
- Where is Spiller going?
- I don't know.

47:08.100 --> 47:10.606
And who is the Captain?

47:18.200 --> 47:22.986
Can I ask where Spiller is going,
and who the Captain is?

47:23.562 --> 47:24.943
To Hamar.

47:26.050 --> 47:31.330
- That was Captain Walther.
Excellent soldier. Parachutist.

47:31.331 --> 47:35.010
- What are you going to do in Hamar?
- What do you think?

47:35.011 --> 47:39.190
- You know I'm expecting an
answer from Minister Koht.

47:39.191 --> 47:42.131
- You have your orders,
and I have mine.

47:42.132 --> 47:45.999
- I get my orders straight from Berlin.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.056
- Oslo Police Superintendent,
Kristian Welhaven, is here.

47:52.090 --> 47:55.617
- Good afternoon, Superintendent.
- Ambassador.

47:55.618 --> 47:58.495
- The Norwegian
Government is reporting -

47:58.496 --> 48:02.129
- that they intend to
continue the negotiations.

48:02.130 --> 48:07.174
- But all hostilities
must cease immediately.

48:07.175 --> 48:09.581
- One moment, Superintendent.

48:11.060 --> 48:15.379
- Did you hear? Stop
the action against Hamar now.

48:15.380 --> 48:18.657
- Can't do. They
received the order and left.

48:18.658 --> 48:20.098
- Then hold them.

48:20.099 --> 48:23.083
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?

48:36.060 --> 48:37.784
Stop!

48:40.100 --> 48:43.325
Stop! Stop the car!

48:53.090 --> 48:56.460
- Superintendent! Wait!

48:57.200 --> 48:59.670
Wait, Superintendent!

49:01.270 --> 49:07.231
- I can't stop every single soldier,
but I want to negotiate.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.196
- Please highlight this
to the Government.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.348
- Will you do this?

49:20.220 --> 49:23.370
- Please wait! Superintendent!

49:23.371 --> 49:29.275
- I have a car.
I can meet anywhere, any time.

49:29.276 --> 49:30.971
Do you understand?

49:36.962 --> 49:40.394
APRIL 9, 19:30
SÆLID FARM, HAMAR.

49:43.090 --> 49:46.518
We saw you!
You threw the snowball!

49:48.240 --> 49:54.062
What did I do? Have I not
been sitting here the whole time?

49:54.063 --> 49:56.270
No, you haven't!

49:56.271 --> 50:00.196
No, he wasn't sitting
here all the time.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.150
Vidkun Quisling, the new leader of
the Norwegian government...

50:05.958 --> 50:07.438
Quiet, Harald.

50:12.110 --> 50:14.969
Women and men of Norway!

50:18.090 --> 50:20.941
Proclamation to the
Norwegian people:

50:23.240 --> 50:27.725
After England broke
Norway's neutrality -

50:27.726 --> 50:31.589
by mining the waters of the
Norwegian territory -

50:31.590 --> 50:34.052
- without anything but
meaningless protests -

50:34.053 --> 50:38.109
from the Government, -

50:38.110 --> 50:43.199
- the German Government offered aid
to the Norwegian Government,

50:43.200 --> 50:46.484
- accompanied by a solemn commitment -

50:46.485 --> 50:50.429
- out of respect for our independence.

50:50.430 --> 50:53.482
- Sorry. German forces
are on their way.

50:53.483 --> 50:55.521
- The Government have abandoned Hamar.

50:55.522 --> 51:00.010
- In response to this offer of solution
to this unsustainable situation,

51:00.011 --> 51:04.030
- the Government implemented a
general mobilization -

51:04.031 --> 51:08.544
- and gave the absurd orders to
the Norwegian army -

51:08.545 --> 51:11.815
- to oppose the German aid by force.

51:12.686 --> 51:14.614
- The Government have run away,

51:14.615 --> 51:20.256
- after risking
the fate of the country.

51:21.051 --> 51:26.404
- Under these circumstances, it is
the duty of the National Union Party -

51:26.405 --> 51:31.576
- to assume power to protect the
interests of the people -

51:31.577 --> 51:35.080
- and the safety and
the independence of Norway.

51:35.081 --> 51:40.219
- We are the only ones, by virtue
of our national goals, -

51:40.220 --> 51:45.060
- who can do this and save the
country of the despair -

51:45.061 --> 51:49.030
- in which the party politicians
have left our people in.

51:49.031 --> 51:52.200
- The Nygaardsvold Government
have stepped back.

51:52.201 --> 51:56.220
- I will add that such that
the situation has developed -

51:56.800 --> 52:00.590
- any resistance, will
not only be futile,

52:00.591 --> 52:06.000
- but will amount to criminal
destruction of life and property.

52:06.001 --> 52:10.749
- Every Government official
or municipalities,

52:10.750 --> 52:13.427
- especially army officers,

52:13.428 --> 52:17.199
- navy, coast guard and air force,

52:17.200 --> 52:22.616
- is obliged to obey orders of the
new National Government.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.453
Any defamation will result -

52:25.454 --> 52:30.229
- in severe punishment to
those responsible.

52:30.230 --> 52:35.679
On the other hand, every
good citizen -

52:35.680 --> 52:37.772
- will be treated fairly
and with consideration.

52:38.540 --> 52:42.139
- The National Government
has taken over,

52:42.140 --> 52:47.522
- with Vidkun Quisling as
Prime and Foreign Minister.

52:47.523 --> 52:51.051
- Superintendent Jonas Lie:
Minister of Justice.

52:51.052 --> 52:54.050
- Dr. Gulbrand Lunde:
Minister for Social Affairs.

52:57.010 --> 53:01.446
- Vidkun Quisling has just
performed a coup d'etat.

53:02.090 --> 53:03.896
- Norway is at war.

53:04.797 --> 53:08.077
- The King and the Government
are on the run.

53:08.510 --> 53:10.882
- They will pass through here.

53:13.180 --> 53:16.328
- Behind them the are German
paratroopers.

53:18.130 --> 53:21.767
- The Germans have one one target,
to capture the King.

53:23.040 --> 53:26.496
- Our task is to stop the Germans.

53:27.070 --> 53:31.792
- We'll defend a line from
the farm to the forest.

53:33.180 --> 53:37.270
- We'll have a road block here.
It will be a critical point.

53:37.271 --> 53:40.864
- When the Germans
get there, we'll take them.

53:43.550 --> 53:49.480
- I want a machine gun in the middle
of the path, east of the sty,

53:49.481 --> 53:55.070
- and a local shooting team
at the forest line.

53:58.630 --> 54:01.056
- Tonight we will be at war.

54:01.057 --> 54:04.042
- Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant.

54:04.043 --> 54:06.360
- Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant!

54:07.020 --> 54:12.300
- Get to it. Groups of three,
build the first position up there.

54:12.301 --> 54:15.080
- Next three, next position.

54:15.081 --> 54:18.533
- Find boards and
spades back there.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.076
- Seeberg!
- Yes, Sergeant.

54:21.077 --> 54:25.219
- I need help to
control the road block.

54:25.687 --> 54:28.269
- But Sergeant, I'm
ready to fight!

54:29.216 --> 54:33.042
- Good. But I need
help to direct traffic there.

54:33.043 --> 54:37.270
- But, Sergeant...
- Seeberg, this is an order.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.180
Diana! Call Berlin.
Minister Ribbentrop.

54:46.755 --> 54:50.434
He can at least get rid of Quisling.

54:50.435 --> 54:54.809
- I know Quisling. An amateur
without any support from the people.

54:54.810 --> 54:58.400
- Talk to him. He doesn't
live far from here.

54:58.401 --> 55:00.670
- Who?
- Quisling.

55:00.671 --> 55:04.461
- I can not!
He performed a coup d'etat!

55:04.462 --> 55:08.130
- It would ruin all my
diplomatic efforts.

55:08.131 --> 55:11.272
- You are a diplomat,
not a soldier.

55:11.273 --> 55:13.778
- Don't try to do their work.

55:22.110 --> 55:26.444
- Seeberg! Stop the
traffic for a moment!

55:28.010 --> 55:29.380
Stop!

55:32.260 --> 55:37.294
Good evening, soldier! I
think it's time to salute.

55:42.240 --> 55:44.664
- Good evening, Sergeant.
- Your Highness.

55:45.130 --> 55:46.548
- What's the plan?

55:54.130 --> 55:56.083
- Good evening, soldier.

55:57.040 --> 56:00.500
- Good evening ... King.

56:01.060 --> 56:05.516
- I've felt like a hare all day.
It's good to see the farm.

56:05.517 --> 56:07.039
- What's your name, soldier?

56:07.040 --> 56:09.699
- Private Fredrik Seeberg, Your Majesty.

56:09.700 --> 56:15.290
- Please know that I am grateful for
what you are doing. All of you.

56:15.291 --> 56:16.954
Everything for the King, Your Majesty.

56:16.955 --> 56:18.426
No, Seeberg.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.696
Everything for Norway.

56:32.000 --> 56:35.536
This is more my taste.
This is good.

56:50.140 --> 56:53.446
Yes? Foreign Minister?

56:58.050 --> 57:03.630
In a few hours the Government
surely will accept the terms.

57:04.000 --> 57:08.190
- Excellent!
- Yes, but...

57:08.191 --> 57:13.073
- This Quisling will never be accepted
as a leader of the Government.

57:13.074 --> 57:17.686
- We like Mr. Quisling.
- We all do.

57:17.687 --> 57:20.757
- But unfortunately he has no support,

57:20.758 --> 57:23.688
- neither of the people,
nor of the King.

57:25.090 --> 57:28.693
Hello? Foreign Minister?

57:29.130 --> 57:31.545
- Hold the line, Bräuer.

57:32.180 --> 57:34.486
- Yes, I'll wait.

57:40.060 --> 57:41.947
- Foreign Minister?

57:46.230 --> 57:48.627
Heil Hitler, mein Führer!

57:48.628 --> 57:51.275
- This is Ambassador Curt Bräuer, Oslo.

57:51.276 --> 57:54.345
- We are very satisfied with the
situation in the north.

57:55.070 --> 57:58.337
- Operation Weserübung was a success.

57:59.030 --> 58:04.099
- Mein Führer. Question regarding
this Quisling...

58:04.100 --> 58:09.070
- Quisling is a good man. He's the
right man in the right place.

58:09.071 --> 58:10.681
- All right, mein Führer.

58:10.682 --> 58:15.797
- What about the Norwegian Government?
They want to negotiate.

58:15.798 --> 58:19.632
- But it will be difficult if
we insist on Quisling...

58:19.633 --> 58:23.130
- Why negotiate with a Government
that attacked us -

58:23.131 --> 58:27.150
- when we came to save them
from the British imperialists?

58:27.151 --> 58:30.170
- Can you explain this, Ambassador?

58:30.171 --> 58:34.050
- No, mein Führer. Only
thought the Government...

58:34.051 --> 58:38.210
- Forget the Government. You must
negotiate directly with the King.

58:38.211 --> 58:41.221
- Insist on talking to him alone.

58:41.222 --> 58:44.219
- Then he will understand the
seriousness of the situation.

58:44.220 --> 58:47.880
- But inland they are
preparing for war...

58:47.881 --> 58:52.156
- You have my confidence and
the authority to act on my behalf.

58:52.157 --> 58:55.161
- Forget the Government.
Talk to the King.

58:55.162 --> 58:58.248
- Good luck. We trust in you.

59:00.170 --> 59:01.936
- Thank you, mein Führer.

59:03.130 --> 59:05.072
- Heil Hitler!

59:18.820 --> 59:21.867
- King Haakon will never
accept Quisling.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.060
- If I arrive with Quisling,
everything is over.

59:27.061 --> 59:29.718
- The King is in hiding!

59:30.544 --> 59:34.535
- Quisling lives nearby.
Talk to him!

59:34.536 --> 59:36.571
- What am I going to tell him?

59:36.572 --> 59:42.230
- Should I beg on my knees?

59:43.000 --> 59:46.891
- If you think it's that easy
we can change jobs!

59:46.892 --> 59:49.803
- I'm a diplomat.
I work for peace!

59:49.804 --> 59:55.000
- What diplomacy? What peace?
Stop calling yourself a diplomat!

59:55.001 --> 59:59.200
- You work for Hitler.
You are just a soldier.

59:59.201 --> 01:00:02.337
- Anyone can be a diplomat -

01:00:02.338 --> 01:00:05.945
- with a gun pointed at
the other guys head!

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.603
Anne...

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.107
- Everything in order?

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:35.847
- What did Berlin say?

01:00:39.438 --> 01:00:42.545
APRIL 9, 21:25
GAARDER FARM

01:00:42.546 --> 01:00:45.515
ELVERUM, 30KM EAST OF HAMAR.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.606
- I will register for service.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.870
- I'll be more useful in
the field than here.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:28.742
- How can I exhort people
to fight if I don't?

01:01:29.206 --> 01:01:30.855
If I don't have the courage myself?

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:37.920
- That soldier that stopped us in Midtskogen.
What was the name?

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:42.010
- Seeberg.
- Yes, he spoke to father.

01:01:42.011 --> 01:01:45.863
- A young boy with a
huge helmet and a huge weapon.

01:01:46.542 --> 01:01:47.987
- Much too young!

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:55.170
How can I look him in the eyes,
take his hand, salute him, -

01:01:55.171 --> 01:02:00.038
- if I'm not prepared to offer
the same as him?

01:02:00.039 --> 01:02:01.339
- For our country!

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:09.770
- Märtha, I need to be able to look myself
in the eyes and say I tried everything.

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:17.378
- It's just a bit sudden.

01:02:18.136 --> 01:02:21.142
- We talked about it last winter.

01:02:21.143 --> 01:02:25.160
- Yes, we... I know.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.237
- But a lot has happened
since last winter.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.030
- What about us?

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.226
- You will stay together.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:57.404
- What about you? What
do you think of this?

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:06.389
- Your Majesty,
can I ask for a word...

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:16.219
- Our main goal should be
to keep the children safe.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:20.645
They, the Crown Prince and
Prince Harald under one roof -

01:03:20.646 --> 01:03:22.516
is not safe.

01:03:22.517 --> 01:03:25.087
- We can't separate them now!

01:03:25.088 --> 01:03:28.065
- Your Majesty, we have to take
the children across the border.

01:03:28.066 --> 01:03:29.872
- I can not leave Norway.

01:03:30.594 --> 01:03:33.069
- We can not leave Norway!
Not now.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.736
- We will not do this.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.606
- Peder is right.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:44.958
- Harald is important.

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:50.766
- And you will be less vulnerable.
Both of you.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:08.900
- We need to separate.
You two stay together.

01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:13.569
- I'll take the children to Sweden.

01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:25.170
- Dad?

01:04:25.796 --> 01:04:28.908
- Look who's coming there.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.556
- Listen...

01:04:31.929 --> 01:04:36.185
- Should we go out and see if there
are any animals on the farm?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.417
- Has piglet ever tried
to ride horses?

01:04:51.913 --> 01:04:56.289
- Have you seen these before?
Not as big as "real" horses.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:03.306
- You'll sit comfortably here
whilst riding, right?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.075
- What is it?
- Grandpa, when are we going home?

01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:16.729
- I don't know.
- Dad!

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:19.674
- Märtha and the kids need to go.
The Germans are coming.

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.930
- We have to go. Come on,
Harald, let's get to the car.

01:05:23.931 --> 01:05:26.939
- What happened?
- Quickly. They are many.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.487
- Where are we going?
- You're going to travel with Mom.

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:34.324
- The German forces have passed Hamar.

01:05:34.325 --> 01:05:37.289
- They are many more than we thought.

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:41.045
- They will be arriving at the
blockade soon, 3 km from here.

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:48.659
- We leave as soon as the princess
and the children are the car.

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.290
- Your Majesty, they are
closer than we thought.

01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:55.363
- My kitty!

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.079
- Grandpa...
- Get in the car.

01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:48.757
- Protect Harald, understood?

01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:54.320
- What did he say?
- He said "Yes, sir!".

01:07:01.941 --> 01:07:05.893
- I love you.
- Be careful...

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.332
- See you soon...

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.356
- Go... no, stop!

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:31.809
- Now go!

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.568
- Your Majesty!

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.953
- I swore this would never happen.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.308
- I would never leave
them like this.

01:09:05.029 --> 01:09:07.340
- You never did.

01:09:12.090 --> 01:09:13.680
- No...

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.345
- No, I know that.

01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:24.586
- Contrary to others...
- Leave your mother alone.

01:09:24.587 --> 01:09:26.532
- She did her best.

01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:30.210
- You have to stop.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:35.367
- I beg your pardon?
- You have to stop saying that.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.645
- That she did the best she could.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:42.590
- That she was there for you, that she tried.
She didn't.

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:46.929
- Fled on horseback to England
as fast as she could.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.322
- She was alway missing!

01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:59.219
- And don't say she was
there for me, because...

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.900
- You were the one!
You were there.

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:07.531
- You and the nannys.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.810
- And now I'm here, -

01:10:12.811 --> 01:10:15.485
- while Märtha and the
children are going to Sweden.

01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:25.704
- On that day, in 1905,
when we came here...

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.792
- We arrived by ship.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:38.863
- We suddenly become King and Queen.
And Crown Prince.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.816
- There were people everywhere.
They waved, greeted us and were happy.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:57.136
- You were not much older
than Harald is now.

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:03.284
- You wore a white dress
that your mother had picked.

01:11:03.285 --> 01:11:05.524
- Looked like a little girl.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.308
- And I carried you all the time.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.207
- Because you were afraid.
And angry.

01:11:17.208 --> 01:11:22.746
- You said all the time:
"Dad, I want to go home."

01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.297
- And I...

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:30.297
- I had decided.
I had a choice.

01:11:30.298 --> 01:11:32.049
- You had no choice.

01:11:32.050 --> 01:11:34.429
- I chose for you.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.291
- And I'm still sorry for that.

01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:47.110
- If you want something different now.
- No, I...

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.381
- Dad, I never said I wanted
something different.

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:55.459
- I just don't want to be
the King that you are.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.476
- They want us to stop in Nybergsund.

01:12:19.477 --> 01:12:21.559
- We can spend the night there.

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:26.920
- It's close to the Swedish border.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.401
- Is anyone here?

01:12:57.170 --> 01:12:58.877
- Good evening.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:01.654
- Do you speak German?

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:04.737
- Yes.

01:13:05.238 --> 01:13:08.090
- I'm Ambassador Curt Bräuer.
Who are you?

01:13:08.091 --> 01:13:10.880
- Waldemar Johansen, office manager.

01:13:10.881 --> 01:13:12.686
- Good. You can help me.

01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:16.267
- I have an important
message for King Haakon.

01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:21.287
- I can't contact the King.
Talk to someone in the palace.

01:13:21.288 --> 01:13:25.039
- I'm the top German
diplomatic representative.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:27.873
- Get in touch with the
King and the Government.

01:13:27.874 --> 01:13:29.299
- It's a matter of life or death!

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:34.125
- Is it not a little late?
You are shooting us.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.546
- I'm alone here.

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:46.330
- You dare to talk about negotiations,
after making it impossible!

01:13:46.331 --> 01:13:50.452
- Believe me, I just want to
help your country.

01:13:50.453 --> 01:13:56.170
- I will do anything to prevent
war and negotiate a solution.

01:13:56.171 --> 01:14:01.080
- I have the permission from the
Führer to to suspend hostilities,

01:14:01.081 --> 01:14:03.744
- but I need to find King Haakon.

01:14:03.745 --> 01:14:06.289
- So, please help me do this!

01:14:24.535 --> 01:14:30.467
APRIL 10, 00:30. MIDTSKOGEN.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.017
- I heard you speak German...
- Yes.

01:14:55.100 --> 01:15:00.173
- That's good. It might be nice
to have you around, if...

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:08.214
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.631
- Don't light that up in here.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.343
- Good evening.
- See you later.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:56.431
- They accepted.
- Really?

01:15:56.432 --> 01:16:01.271
- I'll meet the King at noon.
On one condition.

01:16:01.272 --> 01:16:06.205
- That the advances stop immediately.
I promised them that.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.861
- This will not happen.
- I'm sorry?

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:15.404
- Walther and Spiller have passed Hamar.
Soon they will be at Elverum.

01:16:15.405 --> 01:16:20.214
- Did you not hear me? I have an
audience with the King of Norway.

01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:24.090
We have reached our diplomatic
goal, Lieutenant Colonel.

01:16:24.091 --> 01:16:27.582
I have my orders, Ambassador.

01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:33.318
The Führer personally ordered
to arrange this meeting.

01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:35.278
Are you going to stop me?

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:40.541
Do your work. If you
succeed, my congratulations.

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:43.980
But don't tell me how to do my job!

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.230
Good...

01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:07.074
Anneliese?

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.933
Anneliese, it's me!

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:16.268
Anneliese, open!

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.873
Look at the little one!

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.385
In position! To your stations!

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:03.399
Vestli, do you see anything?

01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:07.799
No. Nothing.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:40.398
Follow me.

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.255
Please be quiet.

01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:25.195
Come on, let's get them...

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:46.060
- What are we waiting for?
- We have to wait for the order.

01:21:46.061 --> 01:21:47.910
No conversation.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.831
What are they doing?

01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:02.839
- Can I shoot?
- Wait for the order!

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.130
Fire! Fire!

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.367
My God, they are
many more than us!

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:47.962
- Seeberg! This way!
- Seeberg, your position is there!

01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:14.748
Damn! Jammed!

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.531
Pass!

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:28.859
Germans!

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:34.924
Take cover!

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.908
Come back, Seeberg!

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:04.408
Seeberg! Come back! Seeberg...

01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:21.445
APRIL 10, 02:50

01:24:21.446 --> 01:24:24.312
NYBERGSUND, TRYSIL
60KM EAST OF ELVERUM

01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:28.472
Your Majesty. Your Highness.

01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:31.802
I don't know if you
know already, but...

01:24:31.803 --> 01:24:34.189
- The Germans have passed Hamar.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.793
- We saw the blockade in Midtskogen.

01:24:37.794 --> 01:24:40.736
- The battle may already have begun.

01:24:40.737 --> 01:24:44.235
- Okay... thank you.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.844
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
Around here.

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.736
- Wake up, Seeberg!

01:25:50.050 --> 01:25:51.888
- We need help here!

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.401
- Pull back!
- Wait, wait...

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:03.020
- What about Seeberg!

01:26:05.335 --> 01:26:07.253
- We can't leave him alone!

01:26:07.254 --> 01:26:11.036
- Vestli, let's go back!
- I'm staying here with Seeberg!

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:16.252
- Vestli, fall back!
- I'll stay here with Seeberg!

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:20.009
- You are a civilian!
Can you stay?

01:26:20.808 --> 01:26:23.616
- Say "Ich bin Zivilist!" Say it!

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:29.535
- Say this when they get here!
Vestli, let's go back.

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.241
- No!
- Vestli, fall back!

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.248
- Wait... his name is Fredrik.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:42.548
- Don't leave him behind!

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:24.650
- Hands Up!

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.528
- Make space. Move it!

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.732
- Do you speak German?

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.900
- Answer me.

01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:10.097
- Where were you going?

01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:18.513
- Do you have armoured vehicles?
Machine guns?

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.900
- Where is the King?

01:28:23.100 --> 01:28:24.828
- And the Government?

01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:29.641
- We have little ammunition
and many casualties.

01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:34.799
- We won't find anything here.
We need reinforcements.

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.513
- Battalions...

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.044
- Two hundred... and more...
- What did you say?

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.956
- Machine guns.
- Battalions?

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.652
- Let's go.

01:29:03.130 --> 01:29:06.436
- To the cars! Draw back!

01:29:06.437 --> 01:29:08.167
- Battalions?

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.159
- But surely there are
no more of you up here?

01:29:22.716 --> 01:29:27.635
APRIL 10, 08:10
NYBERGSUND, TRYSIL

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.730
No, we can't accept this!

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.408
- Only a few hours ago they
tried to get us -

01:29:52.409 --> 01:29:54.550
- and His Majesty the King.

01:29:54.551 --> 01:29:58.374
- And now you want to send my
father back to meet the German!

01:29:58.375 --> 01:29:59.950
- Alone!

01:29:59.951 --> 01:30:03.057
- I don't understand how you
still need to discuss this!

01:30:03.584 --> 01:30:05.172
- And with Quisling in Oslo...

01:30:05.173 --> 01:30:08.951
- Maybe they want to discuss
about a new Government,

01:30:08.952 --> 01:30:10.689
- and Quisling's resignation.

01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:14.434
- Forgive me, Prime Minister,
but these are just empty words.

01:30:14.435 --> 01:30:19.829
- I would never ask this of the
King if it wasn't necessary.

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:25.807
- But the Government and I believe
that negotiation is the only option.

01:30:25.808 --> 01:30:27.758
- I would like to agree with you, -

01:30:27.759 --> 01:30:30.200
- but we have done everything we
can to negotiate.

01:30:30.201 --> 01:30:33.467
- And what was the answer?
Violence! They attacked us!

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.722
- No...

01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:39.417
- Send me.

01:30:39.418 --> 01:30:42.577
- They requested the King in person.
Alone.

01:30:42.578 --> 01:30:44.312
- They broke their own ceasefire, -

01:30:44.313 --> 01:30:47.709
- and you want to send my father
straight into the lions' lair!

01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:52.260
- This is madness!
We must stand for something!

01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:55.200
We have to put an end
to this nightmare!

01:30:57.010 --> 01:30:59.891
- It might calm the situation
if we say that -

01:30:59.892 --> 01:31:01.848
- the King will meet the Germans.

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.815
- If we do nothing, I fear
an even worse bloodbath.

01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:12.314
- Your Majesty...

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.491
- Dad, there must be another option.
Surely.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:40.254
- I think we'll avoid more
bloodshed if we negotiate.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.767
- Can I talk to my
father alone, please?

01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:49.696
- Yes, of course.
- Gentlemen, let's get out.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.589
- All right?

01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:17.447
- Dad?

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.184
- Everything in order?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.180
- If I can avoid more casualties
by meeting the German, -

01:32:31.181 --> 01:32:33.415
- then I have to do it.

01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:39.522
- But father...
- Then I have to go there.

01:32:39.523 --> 01:32:43.010
- We can ask him to come here.

01:32:43.011 --> 01:32:47.032
- We agree a neutral location
and have him brought to us.

01:32:47.033 --> 01:32:50.200
- They can't ask you to go
to Elverum. It's not safe.

01:32:50.201 --> 01:32:54.160
- Even if Koht promised,
you don't have to go.

01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:59.041
- I strongly advise you not to go.
It could be a trap.

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:04.041
- You said you wanted to
fulfil your duty.

01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:09.104
- This is my duty.

01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:14.545
- If this is how it
should be, if...

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:22.721
- If I'm the last
card, then so be it.

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:28.868
- I have to try at least.
- There must be other solutions.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:32.304
- Yes, always. There are
always other solutions.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.749
- But are they the right ones?

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.806
- You should not be like me.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.661
- You must be yourself.

01:33:53.662 --> 01:33:57.713
- And with time you'll become
the King you want to be.

01:34:04.050 --> 01:34:07.993
- Dad, if you go, at least
I should come with you.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.321
- You know you can not.

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:24.443
- Be ready, just in case
something happens.

01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:36.130
- Yes...

01:34:44.150 --> 01:34:47.033
- What do you hope to
accomplish with this?

01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:53.169
- Do you really think the King will
accept Quisling after yesterday?

01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:55.419
- I don't take responsibility for yesterday.

01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:57.999
- Somebody else will have
to answer for that.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:01.941
- Think about your family.
Have they not suffered enough?

01:35:03.150 --> 01:35:05.441
- Let me fetch the King.

01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:13.335
- Just tell me where he is hidden.
- Keep your men away.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:17.623
- Let's play by my rules
for a few hours.

01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:23.512
- What do we have to lose?
- We don't negotiate. We take.

01:35:23.513 --> 01:35:26.845
- You are not the only
one going to Elverum.

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:31.368
- Keep an eye on the sky.

01:35:31.369 --> 01:35:34.729
- You never know when it will
fall on top of your head.

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:46.406
- I'm leaving now. All going well,
I'll be back tonight.

01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:53.341
What are you doing?

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.588
I'm going.

01:35:56.850 --> 01:35:58.906
And I'm taking Clara with me.

01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:01.757
Where to?

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.661
Home.

01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:13.756
I have no words to say how
sorry I am, Anneliese.

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.581
Please forgive me.

01:36:20.010 --> 01:36:22.784
Could you forgive me again?

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:25.429
- Ambassador
- I'm coming.

01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.738
- The car...
- I'm coming, I said!

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:38.294
- I'm so sorry for what happened.

01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:44.446
- Please forgive me.

01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:48.918
- Forgive me.

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.764
- Who do we have here?

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:09.108
- See you soon, my dear.

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:32.880
- Your Majesty, we don't have to
leave for another half an hour.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.807
- I can't stay here any longer.

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:42.255
- Can I ask you to enter
the car, for safety?

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:45.392
- Let's just drive.
- As you wish.

01:37:45.393 --> 01:37:47.264
- Øyvind, we're ready!

01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:54.136
- Dad! You don't have
to leave yet?

01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:02.433
- If something happens...

01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:07.441
- there are a number of practical
things you need to know.

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:11.012
- Peder knows everything.
- I know all that.

01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:36.828
- Never be alone.
Always keep Märtha by your side.

01:38:40.190 --> 01:38:44.164
- If something happens, you need
someone to trust, to love.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.783
- Protect the children.

01:38:57.110 --> 01:39:01.263
- Everything for Norway... right?

GERMAN-NORWEGIAN DICTIONARY

01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:50.781
- "Your Majesty..."

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:56.141
- "Your Majesty, it's an honour."

APRIL 10, 12:30
ELVERUM PUBLIC SCHOOL

01:40:18.130 --> 01:40:21.029
- Your Majesty.
- Mr. Koht.

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:25.306
- Mowinckel. Sundby...

01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:31.205
- So, this is where it will happen.
- What?

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.029
- This is where it will happen.
- One can say that...

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.659
- We can arrange a room for you -

01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:42.388
- and let you know when the
Ambassador arrives.

01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.357
- Very well.

01:40:47.090 --> 01:40:48.749
See.

01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:59.098
- Out. Get out of the car.
- What is he saying?

01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:02.154
- Get him out
- Ask him what he wants.

01:41:02.155 --> 01:41:04.059
- Only him!

01:41:04.060 --> 01:41:08.347
- Come back inside.
- I'll fix this.

01:41:08.348 --> 01:41:10.230
- Only you.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.219
- Sorry, the time is running out.
If you please...

01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:18.929
- Shut up!
- Sorry, is this really ...

01:41:19.984 --> 01:41:22.199
- I'm sorry...

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.142
- Do you understand German?

01:41:24.143 --> 01:41:28.605
- No!
- I'm the German Ambassador...

01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:44.709
- Yes?

01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:50.117
- More coffee?
- No, I think it's enough.

01:41:50.118 --> 01:41:52.449
- Your Majesty,
something is wrong.

01:41:52.450 --> 01:41:53.983
- He's just delayed.

01:41:53.984 --> 01:41:56.329
- Are you sure?

01:41:56.330 --> 01:42:00.534
- As sure as you were that the
Germans would not invade us?

01:42:01.050 --> 01:42:04.498
- I think we have to break up.
- Take it easy.

01:42:04.499 --> 01:42:06.328
- Your Majesty, let's leave now.

01:42:07.190 --> 01:42:09.916
- I can't open it.
- Look...

01:42:11.454 --> 01:42:12.918
- Your Majesty.

01:42:12.919 --> 01:42:17.220
- I need some air.
- Here. This will open.

01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:24.401
- There he is. Are You ready?
- Yes, let's go.

01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:27.417
- I'll go down and receive him.

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:47.300
- Minister Koht.
- Dr. Bräuer.

01:42:47.301 --> 01:42:49.133
- Pleasure.
- Welcome.

01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.735
- Your Majesty, it's an honor.

01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:06.927
- My Lord.
- Thank you.

01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:16.103
- Mr. Lykke and Mowinckel.
- Good morning.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:29.032
- I've heard that His Majesty
understands German.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.239
- If allowed, I would appreciate
if we could continue in German.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:39.402
- Unfortunately, my Norwegian
is not great.

01:43:45.110 --> 01:43:50.050
- Well... after confering
with the German Führer, -

01:43:50.051 --> 01:43:53.952
- I have the authority to
negotiate directly with Your Majesty.

01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:57.525
- With all due respect, -

01:43:57.526 --> 01:44:01.230
- the conversation was scheduled
between me and His Majesty.

01:44:01.231 --> 01:44:04.782
- Is that correct?
- He misunderstood.

01:44:04.783 --> 01:44:06.913
- This will be resolved.

01:44:06.914 --> 01:44:12.026
- This issue will be discussed
only with the Government present.

01:44:12.027 --> 01:44:16.753
- I wish that these gentlemen
are present as witnesses.

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:22.329
- Unfortunately, I must insist.
My orders are from the Führer.

01:44:22.330 --> 01:44:25.031
Just Your Majesty and my humble person.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:30.799
- It's important that the
Government is represented.

01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:34.410
- He wants us to leave...

01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:38.528
- Then we quit.

01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:44.234
- Your Majesty.

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:52.834
- Mr. Bräuer! We will
do as you wish.

01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.578
- Yes. Gentlemen, let's get out.

01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:13.000
- I've had the pleasure to meet Your
Majesty on an earlier occasion.

01:45:13.001 --> 01:45:16.525
- Can Your Majesty remember?

01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:24.011
- For me, at least,
it was a great day.

01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:37.210
- You should know that the Führer
holds great esteem for Your Majesty.

01:45:37.961 --> 01:45:39.529
- And Your brother.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.273
- I nurture great respect
for the kingdom of Norway -

01:45:45.859 --> 01:45:49.996
- and for the monarchy,
as an institution.

01:45:51.010 --> 01:45:54.750
- But, currently, we have
control of the country.

01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:59.073
- The official Government has no power.
Quisling has.

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:02.409
- And it's the Führer's
wish that it remains so.

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.600
- The agreement the Führer wishes
to sign with Your Majesty -

01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:16.289
- remains the same, but with
Quisling as Prime Minister.

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:21.868
- Your Majesty, may
I speak frankly?

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.279
- I fully understand
that a solution -

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:29.129
- so comprehensive can
not be so filed.

01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:34.869
- I have great respect for Your
Majesty, but not for Quisling.

01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:38.849
- Instead, I share of
Your disdain for him.

01:46:38.850 --> 01:46:44.205
- He is a miserable creature that has
interfered with the negotiations.

01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:49.633
- But he has a reputation in Berlin.
Even Hitler knows who he is.

01:46:49.634 --> 01:46:53.353
- That's why I asked for this
meeting, eye to eye.

01:46:53.354 --> 01:46:57.369
- I am ready to submit an
alternative proposal.

01:46:58.050 --> 01:47:02.135
- The agreement remains the same,
but without Quisling.

01:47:03.810 --> 01:47:06.135
- I give you my word, Your Majesty.

01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:11.931
- If Your Majesty signs
here and now, -

01:47:11.932 --> 01:47:14.715
- Quisling will be gone.

01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.801
- I'm running a big risk.

01:47:19.802 --> 01:47:23.315
- Hitler wants Quisling, but You rather.

01:47:23.316 --> 01:47:28.702
- I'm so convinced of this
that I'm risking my career.

01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:32.618
- Does Your Majesty understand
what I'm saying?

01:47:32.619 --> 01:47:34.908
- I mean, my German?

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:43.005
- Do they expect a yes or no?
Here and now?

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:46.597
- Well...

01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:52.692
- The offer will not be repeated.
You can save Norway.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.495
- Become a hero of the country!
The King of the People!

01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:02.709
- Did you know that in the
whole history of Norway, -

01:48:02.710 --> 01:48:06.529
- I was the first King to be
elected by the people?

01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:10.541
- Norway is a democracy.

01:48:10.542 --> 01:48:15.351
- The people choose. The people
are heard and respected.

01:48:15.352 --> 01:48:21.188
- I would neglect all this if
I gave you an answer now.

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:26.747
- The destination of our country
is not decided in a room,

01:48:26.748 --> 01:48:29.575
- eye in the eye.

01:48:29.576 --> 01:48:33.220
- The decision must be
made by the whole people.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:40.047
- I have a lot of respect for
Your Majesty's attitude.

01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:45.263
- But if you say "no," people will die.
It's that simple.

01:48:45.264 --> 01:48:49.802
- Young Norwegians will lose
their life in a meaningless war.

01:48:49.803 --> 01:48:53.190
- Do You want this on Your conscience?

01:48:53.191 --> 01:48:57.296
- To have the blood of Norwegian
men and women on Your hands?

01:48:58.110 --> 01:48:59.960
- Your Majesty...

01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:05.448
- I have a 5 month old
daughter, born in Norway.

01:49:05.449 --> 01:49:10.110
- The last thing I want is for
her to grow up amid the war.

01:49:10.111 --> 01:49:14.185
- Please sign, here and now.

01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:16.794
- Save Norway.

01:49:17.706 --> 01:49:21.089
- Do like your brother. In Denmark
barely a shot was fired.

01:49:21.090 --> 01:49:24.315
- You dare to teach me
about my own brother!

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.755
- About my own family!

01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:31.842
- Who do you think you are?

01:49:31.843 --> 01:49:34.201
- A messenger, Your Majesty, -

01:49:34.202 --> 01:49:39.080
- who wants the best for Norway and
who believes in a peaceful solution.

01:49:39.081 --> 01:49:42.200
- A nice little peace dove,
that's what you are!

01:49:42.201 --> 01:49:46.344
- A negotiator amongst
all the war merchants.

01:49:47.190 --> 01:49:53.160
- But a peace dove wouldn't
demand to surrender our country.

01:49:53.161 --> 01:49:54.582
- This offer...

01:49:54.583 --> 01:49:57.625
- You're not any better than Hitler!

01:49:57.626 --> 01:50:02.614
- Majesty, this agreement
is valid just here and now.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.690
- Let's bring in the
Foreign Minister again.

01:50:06.691 --> 01:50:12.040
- Towards the Government we will not
be so lenient, if you understand me...

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.079
- I don't know what you talked
about while we were outside, -

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.080
- but the Government of Norway
is ready to negotiate, -

01:50:25.081 --> 01:50:29.180
- as soon as we know
the conditions.

01:50:29.181 --> 01:50:32.608
- It will not happen without
the signature of the...

01:50:32.609 --> 01:50:37.160
- Koht, what is this?
- I'm saying we can negotiate.

01:50:37.161 --> 01:50:40.267
- Please sit down.

01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:46.643
- Dr. Bräuer, could we
continue in English?

01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:51.145
- Firstly: You can negotiate with us.

01:50:51.146 --> 01:50:55.193
- I can't negotiate. I have clear
orders from the Führer.

01:50:55.194 --> 01:50:59.784
- I've exceeded them already.
The law will be invalidated.

01:50:59.785 --> 01:51:03.089
Please, Mr. Bräuer, we have authority.

01:51:03.090 --> 01:51:06.639
- We are the Government.
- I have to say good afternoon.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:09.264
- Dr. Bräuer, we need
to continue to talk.

01:51:09.265 --> 01:51:10.886
- No. I'm sorry.

01:51:10.887 --> 01:51:12.869
- Dr. Bräuer, please...

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:16.265
- I expect the Government's
response by this evening.

01:51:16.266 --> 01:51:18.946
- Mr. Koht, I'm sorry.

01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:01.590
- It has left a great
impression on me -

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:09.039
- that the responsibility for what
will happen to the people and the country -

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:14.703
- if the German demands are rejected,
is put on me.

01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:21.459
- It's a heavy responsibility.

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:27.103
- So heavy that I dread to bear it.

01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:36.160
- It's the Government that
has the decision, -

01:52:36.161 --> 01:52:39.034
- but my position is clear:

01:52:41.190 --> 01:52:45.369
- I can not accept the German demands.

01:52:47.050 --> 01:52:52.642
- It would be contrary to everything
I think is my duty as a King -

01:52:52.643 --> 01:52:56.659
- since I arrived to this country,
almost 35 years ago.

01:52:56.660 --> 01:52:59.512
- I can not cross that line.

01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:03.799
I don't want to cross that line.

01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:10.774
- I don't want this to be the
deciding factor for the Government.

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.157
- But I have carefully
tested myself...

01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.933
- and weighted my position.

01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:43.240
- And I can not name Quisling,

01:53:43.241 --> 01:53:47.116
- that I know not to have any
support from the people.

01:53:50.230 --> 01:53:54.516
- Should the Government
decide to accept -

01:53:54.517 --> 01:53:56.392
- the German demands, -

01:53:57.190 --> 01:53:59.881
- and I totally understand -

01:53:59.882 --> 01:54:04.585
- the reasons to do so,

01:54:04.586 --> 01:54:10.381
- in view of the imminent
danger in which we are in, -

01:54:11.130 --> 01:54:14.169
- and because of the large
number of young Norwegians -

01:54:14.170 --> 01:54:18.656
- that will have to sacrifice
their lives in the fight.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:25.836
- Should you choose to
accept these demands, -

01:54:32.110 --> 01:54:37.564
- then there is no
other way for me...

01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:41.244
- but to abdicate.

01:54:46.150 --> 01:54:50.396
- For me and for my house.

01:55:18.150 --> 01:55:21.350
- I understand. Thank you.
