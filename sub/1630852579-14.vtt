BRIAN:
"Well, all I can tell you
is they’re not ours."

00:07.382 --> 00:09.552
"Not ours?
What are you talking about?"

00:09.635 --> 00:13.105
NARRATOR:
A mysterious material
not of this world.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.682
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
As I understand, it is...

00:15.766 --> 00:18.726
pure aluminum, 99.5%.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.810
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
As far as I know,

00:19.895 --> 00:23.945
we can’t produce 99.5%.

00:24.066 --> 00:27.776
NARRATOR:
Leaked government footage
of a strange craft.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.573
I’ve never seen anything
like this in my life.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.117
NARRATOR:
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

00:33.242 --> 00:35.872
we’ve traveled
to mysterious sites,

00:35.953 --> 00:37.833
met with eyewitnesses

00:37.913 --> 00:39.373
and closely examined evidence

00:39.456 --> 00:42.206
of unidentified flying objects.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.050
Now we take a look back

00:45.128 --> 00:49.048
at some of the most incredible
reports we’ve investigated.

00:49.132 --> 00:53.222
Reports that, according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

00:53.303 --> 00:57.813
provide undeniable proof
of extraterrestrial visitation.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.733
♪ ♪

01:14.783 --> 01:16.533
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

01:16.618 --> 01:18.908
we’ve investigated
not only evidence

01:18.996 --> 01:22.536
of extraterrestrial contact
in the distant past

01:22.624 --> 01:25.004
but incredible
modern-day sightings

01:25.127 --> 01:27.417
of unidentified flying objects

01:27.504 --> 01:30.094
that suggest
these visitors never left.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.473
In recent years,
the United States Navy

01:33.594 --> 01:36.644
has released
extraordinary UFO videos

01:36.763 --> 01:39.813
that even they admit
they cannot explain.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.483
What could be more convincing
than that?

01:42.561 --> 01:44.691
Well, in 2019,

01:44.813 --> 01:48.073
investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe showed me

01:48.150 --> 01:53.490
what she believes are remnants
of an actual alien craft.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.205
NARRATOR:
Pahrump, Nevada.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.407
1996.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.205
Art Bell,

02:02.331 --> 02:06.461
founder and original host of the
paranormal-themed radio program

02:06.543 --> 02:08.803
<i>Coast to Coast AM</i>

02:08.879 --> 02:10.709
begins receiving shipments
in the mail

02:10.839 --> 02:14.429
of mysterious
metallic fragments.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.679
HOWE:
Art Bell started getting

02:16.762 --> 02:18.512
two shipments

02:18.597 --> 02:21.097
coming from a man
who identified himself

02:21.183 --> 02:23.983
in a series
of five typed letters.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.271
And it said
he was an Army sergeant,

02:26.355 --> 02:29.575
that his grandfather
had died in 1974

02:29.691 --> 02:34.491
and had left a box
that had a diary and metals.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.281
In the diary, it said

02:37.366 --> 02:38.826
that the grandfather,

02:38.909 --> 02:41.409
with a group of security people,

02:41.536 --> 02:44.536
saw a wedge-shaped craft

02:44.623 --> 02:48.213
that was on what was then called
in the ’40s

02:48.335 --> 02:51.465
White Sands Proving Ground
in southern New Mexico.

02:51.546 --> 02:56.426
The grandfather saw the bottom
of it glow for three hours

02:56.551 --> 02:58.141
while they stood around it,

02:58.220 --> 03:01.060
and he pulled off scrapings--

03:01.139 --> 03:03.139
he called them scrapings--

03:03.225 --> 03:05.985
from the bottom
of the wedge-shaped craft

03:06.061 --> 03:07.351
where it had glowed.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.605
NARRATOR:
Art Bell turned over these
mysterious fragments and letters

03:11.733 --> 03:14.443
to investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

03:14.569 --> 03:16.449
for further study.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.617
In June of 1996,

03:19.741 --> 03:21.871
Linda commissioned University
of Michigan researchers

03:21.952 --> 03:25.462
to use
a scanning electron microscope

03:25.580 --> 03:29.040
and a technique known as
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry

03:29.126 --> 03:32.496
to analyze the samples
and determine their makeup.

03:32.587 --> 03:36.377
HOWE:
It was made out of bismuth,
almost pure,

03:36.466 --> 03:38.376
one to four microns,

03:38.468 --> 03:40.968
and that was the black layer.

03:41.096 --> 03:46.056
The next layer
was 97.6% magnesium,

03:46.143 --> 03:48.443
2.4% zinc,

03:48.520 --> 03:50.730
and that layering

03:50.814 --> 03:52.824
was alternating like that.

03:52.941 --> 03:58.741
So, I went to an exotic metals
manufacturer in New Jersey,

03:58.822 --> 04:02.082
and I said,
"How would you make this?"

04:02.159 --> 04:07.159
He said nobody can put
bismuth and magnesium together.

04:07.289 --> 04:10.119
It will automatically
come apart.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.380
This had to have
been manufactured

04:14.463 --> 04:19.343
by some kind
of an advanced technology,

04:19.468 --> 04:21.718
and he didn’t know
what that would be either.

04:23.305 --> 04:26.475
GEORGE KNAPP:
I think we’ve got technology
that we didn’t make.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.058
A lot of people
have come forward

04:28.143 --> 04:30.603
with bits and pieces
of the same tale.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.267
We are presently analyzing
metamaterials

04:33.356 --> 04:34.726
that we did not make

04:34.816 --> 04:36.066
that’s created in a way

04:36.151 --> 04:38.031
that is beyond our technology.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.447
Hey, Linda.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.620
-Hey, it’s good to see you!
-Good to see you.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.539
NARRATOR:
To learn more about these
strange metallic fragments,

04:45.660 --> 04:50.290
in 2019, ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

04:50.373 --> 04:54.383
met up with Linda Moulton Howe
at a secure storage facility

04:54.503 --> 04:56.883
in Los Angeles, California.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.585
-Man, this is some door.
-(beep)

04:58.673 --> 04:59.843
(chuckles)

04:59.925 --> 05:01.555
Okay.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.386
Well, over the years,
I’ve learned

05:04.513 --> 05:06.723
that this is
really pretty valuable.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.928
-Right.
-And I better keep it
in something

05:09.017 --> 05:11.477
-like a safety deposit box.
-Right.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.941
NARRATOR:
Earlier in 2019,

05:15.023 --> 05:17.323
the United States Army
took an interest

05:17.400 --> 05:20.610
in doing its own examination
of these materials.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.065
Linda is eager to show Giorgio
just what it is

05:24.199 --> 05:27.199
that has caught
the Army’s attention.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.327
Here is where the magic

05:30.413 --> 05:32.583
-bismuth-magnesium-zinc resides.
-There it is,

05:32.707 --> 05:35.207
-inside the magic box.
-Yeah. Here,

05:35.293 --> 05:37.633
-I’ll take it over here
and show it to you.
-’Kay.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.046
I have found,

05:45.136 --> 05:48.256
since having this in 1996

05:48.390 --> 05:51.430
and evolving with research,

05:51.560 --> 05:53.940
that it has become now
so valuable.

06:00.944 --> 06:05.624
-What am I looking at, Linda?
What is this?
-Well, here is...

06:05.740 --> 06:08.530
-See all these layers?
-Yeah.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.958
-HOWE: When you go to a scanning
electron microscope...
-Huh.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.501
...and you see that the black,
the black side,

06:16.585 --> 06:18.345
it’s pure bismuth,

06:18.420 --> 06:20.630
and it’s one to four microns,

06:20.755 --> 06:22.835
which is about half the size
of a blood cell,

06:22.924 --> 06:26.054
and then it’s alternating
just like a torte cake.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.296
-TSOUKALOS: Yeah.
-And the top silver,

06:28.430 --> 06:30.060
that’s the magnesium-zinc alloy.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.980
-Okay.
-So, layer by layer
by layer in microns.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.272
TSOUKALOS:
It’s almost as if
it’s reflective, too.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.114
HOWE:
Yes, and when you get it
in the sun,

06:38.189 --> 06:40.689
it looks like a snowfield.

06:40.775 --> 06:43.735
And that’s the magnesium zinc.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.990
NARRATOR:
In addition
to this layered material,

06:46.114 --> 06:50.084
Linda also has
an unusual piece of aluminum.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.250
HOWE:
As I understand,
from a physicist,

06:53.330 --> 06:55.210
it is this--

06:55.290 --> 06:56.210
pure aluminum,

06:56.291 --> 06:59.461
99.5% pure aluminum.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.344
TSOUKALOS:
As far as I know,
we can’t produce 99-point...

07:02.464 --> 07:05.804
I mean, this is incredibly pure.

07:05.884 --> 07:08.764
So where were these pieces
allegedly found?

07:08.845 --> 07:11.305
HOWE:
These came out of White Sands

07:11.389 --> 07:13.979
in New Mexico,
outside of Roswell.

07:14.059 --> 07:17.849
Is there a connection
to Roswell with this piece?

07:20.023 --> 07:22.403
NARRATOR:
In July of 1947,

07:22.484 --> 07:25.864
an unidentified flying object
crashed to Earth

07:25.987 --> 07:29.947
in the desert just outside
Roswell, New Mexico.

07:30.033 --> 07:34.623
It is today the most famous
UFO event on record,

07:34.704 --> 07:36.624
in part
because it was the Army itself

07:36.706 --> 07:40.246
that reported the craft
as a flying disc.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.465
BILL BIRNES:
July 8 and 9,

07:42.545 --> 07:44.085
the newspaper headlines--

07:44.172 --> 07:47.592
"Army Captures Flying Disc
Outside of Roswell."

07:47.676 --> 07:50.636
How did the newspaper get
that story? Walter Haut.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.310
He was the official
public information officer

07:53.390 --> 07:54.890
at the Roswell 509th

07:55.016 --> 07:56.596
who gave the story
to the newspaper.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.021
NARRATOR:
But the military
quickly walked back its story.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.073
Within days,
the mysterious Roswell UFO

08:05.193 --> 08:07.533
was given an earthly origin

08:07.654 --> 08:10.284
when the government claimed
that the downed craft

08:10.365 --> 08:12.785
was merely a weather balloon.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.704
DAVID CHILDRESS: When you look
at the whole Roswell incident,

08:16.830 --> 08:18.870
it seems to be a recovery

08:18.957 --> 08:21.877
that was very much
a scrambled ad hoc thing.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.762
And, in fact, witnesses
had been to the crash site

08:25.880 --> 08:27.380
before the military got there.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.677
In the chaos of trying
to clean up this crash site,

08:31.761 --> 08:35.471
you have to wonder that whether
they would really get it all.

08:35.557 --> 08:39.137
Where would this material
actually go?

08:39.227 --> 08:42.017
And would they have left
some of it behind,

08:42.105 --> 08:43.365
just by accident?

08:44.566 --> 08:47.106
NARRATOR:
In April 2011,

08:47.235 --> 08:49.485
the FBI released
thousands of files

08:49.571 --> 08:52.621
as part of its online FBI vault,

08:52.741 --> 08:57.331
including a 1950 briefing
to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover

08:57.412 --> 09:01.672
regarding informant information
about three "flying saucers"

09:01.750 --> 09:04.340
that were recovered
in New Mexico.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.379
Many researchers believe

09:06.463 --> 09:08.803
this corroborates
long-standing rumors

09:08.923 --> 09:12.223
that the Roswell incident
involved not one

09:12.302 --> 09:14.802
but three crashed UFOs.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.180
And there were numerous
other incidents reported

09:18.266 --> 09:21.136
during that time period
in the area of Roswell

09:21.269 --> 09:25.439
and White Sands Proving Ground
that remain mostly unknown.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.941
TSOUKALOS:
Are there more pieces
of these items?

09:30.028 --> 09:32.908
Well, for the last,
uh, 15 years,

09:32.989 --> 09:36.199
I had a combination
of another piece

09:36.284 --> 09:37.914
of the bismuth-magnesium-zinc

09:37.994 --> 09:41.544
and another smaller piece
of the aluminum.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.673
So, the pair that I had before

09:44.793 --> 09:47.173
is now involved
with military testing.

09:49.881 --> 09:52.431
NARRATOR:
In 2019,

09:52.509 --> 09:56.139
Linda handed over additional
samples of the exotic metals

09:56.262 --> 09:59.062
for examination
by the United States Army.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.430
If multiple flying discs crashed

10:01.518 --> 10:04.898
in the New Mexico desert
in 1947,

10:04.979 --> 10:08.229
was all the debris recovered
long ago?

10:08.316 --> 10:11.396
Many believe there are
still remnants to be found.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.276
And at a unique
sky watch facility

10:14.364 --> 10:16.034
in the Pacific Northwest,

10:16.157 --> 10:18.117
researchers suggest

10:18.201 --> 10:20.751
they have
even more compelling evidence--

10:20.829 --> 10:24.499
a glimpse inside an alien craft.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.920
We’ve covered all kinds
of UFO investigations

10:31.005 --> 10:32.335
on <i>Ancient Aliens.</i>

10:32.423 --> 10:35.183
But at ECETI Ranch
in Washington State,

10:35.260 --> 10:38.510
a team of investigators
have taken UFO hunting

10:38.596 --> 10:40.346
to a whole new level,

10:40.431 --> 10:43.521
because they’re watching the
skies not only with telescopes

10:43.601 --> 10:46.981
and the naked eye
but also with remote viewers.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.523
In 2019,
Nick Pope traveled to the ranch

10:50.608 --> 10:52.358
to see this for himself,

10:52.443 --> 10:57.663
and what he experienced was
nothing short of mind-blowing.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.622
NARRATOR:
In May 2019,

11:01.703 --> 11:04.663
former British intelligence
officer Nick Pope

11:04.747 --> 11:08.327
visited the ECETI Ranch
in the Pacific Northwest.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.878
ECETI is home
to the Enlightened Contact

11:11.963 --> 11:15.223
with Extraterrestrial
Intelligence organization.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.550
UFO hunters consider it
a major hot spot

11:18.678 --> 11:20.888
for unexplained
aerial phenomena.

11:21.890 --> 11:24.310
Over the past 33 years,

11:24.392 --> 11:28.562
scientists from Boeing, NASA
and Lockheed Skunk Works

11:28.688 --> 11:33.028
have come to ECETI to research
the activity in the sky.

11:33.109 --> 11:37.489
But what sets ECETI apart from
other UFO watch organizations

11:37.572 --> 11:40.702
is that their most powerful
observational tool

11:40.783 --> 11:42.703
is not a telescope--

11:42.785 --> 11:44.695
it’s remote viewers.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.417
NICK POPE:
Remote viewing is essentially

11:47.498 --> 11:52.088
taking people who have
or believe they have

11:52.212 --> 11:55.052
the ability to see things
not with their eyes

11:55.131 --> 11:56.881
but with their mind

11:56.966 --> 12:00.886
and putting them to work
gathering intelligence.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.890
My first exposure
to remote viewing came

12:03.973 --> 12:07.233
when I ran the U.K. government’s
UFO program.

12:07.310 --> 12:11.270
We looked at UFOs,
crop circles, alien abductions.

12:11.356 --> 12:15.106
Anything mysterious
and unexplained, I did it.

12:15.235 --> 12:21.415
Remote viewing might be tapping
into unknown dimensions.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.911
I know this sounds
like science fiction,

12:22.992 --> 12:24.292
but, actually, it isn’t.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.749
Some of the work being done
at places

12:25.828 --> 12:27.658
like the Large Hadron Collider

12:27.789 --> 12:31.129
are now quite seriously looking
at the concept

12:31.209 --> 12:33.089
of other dimensions.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.875
NARRATOR:
At ECETI, ex-government
remote viewing expert,

12:36.965 --> 12:38.975
-John Vivanco...
-Hi there.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.970
NARRATOR:
and UFO sky-watcher,
Peter Slattery

12:42.053 --> 12:43.763
lead a team of remote viewers.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.136
Today, they are working
on an experiment

12:47.267 --> 12:49.477
that will combine
human observation

12:49.602 --> 12:50.812
and remote viewing

12:50.937 --> 12:53.187
in an attempt
to better understand

12:53.314 --> 12:55.114
what has become
a recent increase

12:55.191 --> 12:58.901
in UFO sightings over
Washington state’s Mount Adams.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.491
So, let me know, please,

13:01.572 --> 13:03.912
what are your respective
backgrounds with this?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.622
I am a remote viewer.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.332
I’ve been doing this
professionally

13:07.412 --> 13:09.412
for 20 years--
over 20 years now.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.037
And I run a team
of remote viewers,

13:11.165 --> 13:13.665
and we work operational type
projects for clients,

13:13.751 --> 13:15.881
and we look at

13:16.004 --> 13:17.514
different types
of phenomena that can’t

13:17.630 --> 13:19.840
be explained through
conventional means.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.676
I’m known as an experiencer
slash contactee,

13:22.760 --> 13:24.350
but also, I hold
sky watch events.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.929
So, we’re gonna do
a sky watch and just

13:26.014 --> 13:27.644
-see what happens.
-Where are we gonna do that?

13:27.724 --> 13:29.854
Just gonna go to the sky watch
field here. So, let’s go

13:29.976 --> 13:31.936
-and check it out.
-Okay, great.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.860
NARRATOR:
As Nick joins Peter to conduct
field surveillance,

13:34.939 --> 13:39.359
John has stationed two remote
viewers in a windowless room,

13:39.485 --> 13:43.195
armed with nothing more
than a pencil and a drawing pad.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.371
The way it works is that

13:45.491 --> 13:49.041
a remote viewer is given
a random, eight-digit number

13:49.120 --> 13:51.710
connected to what
they’re supposed to remote view.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.711
Now, they don’t get
what they’re supposed to

13:54.834 --> 13:57.214
remote view,
only the number, that’s it.

13:57.295 --> 14:01.135
They’re gonna be at
the location of whatever it is,

14:01.215 --> 14:02.965
through the mind describing

14:03.051 --> 14:04.391
exactly what that is.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.258
So, what
are these remote viewers

14:08.389 --> 14:09.349
actually gonna
be doing in there?

14:09.432 --> 14:11.182
It’s not so much viewing,

14:11.267 --> 14:12.517
we get visual snippets

14:12.602 --> 14:14.482
and a lot of body sensations.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.612
Basically, they’re gonna be
drawing and writing

14:16.731 --> 14:18.401
a lot on paper.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.154
And afterwards,

14:20.234 --> 14:21.784
once we’ve got the data,

14:21.903 --> 14:23.493
how are we actually
going to analyze it?

14:23.571 --> 14:26.491
So, I will collect
that information

14:26.574 --> 14:29.204
from them when they’re done,
and then, in the morning,

14:29.285 --> 14:31.285
we can meet up
and see if we can come up

14:31.412 --> 14:33.372
with some explanation
for what went on.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.706
Well, great, that sounds good.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.292
I hope that we’re gonna have

14:37.418 --> 14:39.998
some interesting
and meaningful results.

14:41.422 --> 14:44.762
NARRATOR:
After discussing the details
of the evening’s plans,

14:44.842 --> 14:47.182
Peter and Nick part ways
with John

14:47.261 --> 14:50.101
and join the rest of
the sky watch team in the field.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.681
Pete, I see the team
has grown somewhat.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.767
PETER:
We’ve got Adam here with us.
He’s gonna be helping out

14:55.853 --> 14:58.153
with the satellite tracker
and monitoring the gear.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.572
It’s just very important
to be very quick off

14:59.649 --> 15:01.359
the mark, knowing what’s what.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.782
Sometimes,
we can have two things

15:02.902 --> 15:04.492
in the sky at the same time,

15:04.612 --> 15:06.242
and one of them could be
a satellite, the other not,

15:06.322 --> 15:07.782
people can mix it up.
So, when we’re focused

15:07.907 --> 15:09.157
on the sky, it’s great that

15:09.283 --> 15:10.913
somebody’s focused
on the satellite tracker.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.043
Great. So, we’re essentially
making sure

15:13.121 --> 15:14.751
-we don’t miss anything?
-Oh, definitely, yeah.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.121
We don’t want
to muddle things up.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.079
NARRATOR:
The team gets to work

15:18.167 --> 15:19.457
setting up the watch station

15:19.544 --> 15:22.804
before the sun goes down
for the evening.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.050
They will be using
various technology,

15:25.133 --> 15:28.143
including infrared cameras
in order to capture

15:28.219 --> 15:30.549
any anomalies in the sky.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.852
The location for their watch
overlooks Mount Adams,

15:34.976 --> 15:37.096
the largest active volcano

15:37.186 --> 15:39.226
in Washington state
and a hot spot

15:39.313 --> 15:41.403
for UFO sightings.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.942
In fact,

15:43.025 --> 15:46.605
Mount Adams is associated
with the first UFO case

15:46.696 --> 15:49.776
to ever make
nationwide headlines.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.752
In June of 1947,

15:54.829 --> 15:58.169
aviator and businessman
Kenneth Arnold

15:58.291 --> 16:01.291
claimed to have witnessed
nine UFOs flying in tandem

16:01.377 --> 16:04.837
from Mount Rainier
at incredible speeds.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.431
He reported that they
performed a number of unusual

16:10.511 --> 16:13.561
maneuvers and then disappeared

16:13.681 --> 16:15.931
into Mount Adams.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.347
As night sets in,

16:17.435 --> 16:20.155
the team has all eyes
glued to the sky

16:20.229 --> 16:21.939
and on the lookout
for any objects

16:22.023 --> 16:24.533
that might cross their path.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.028
Utilizing real-time
satellite tracking data,

16:29.113 --> 16:30.783
they can anticipate the arrival

16:30.865 --> 16:32.285
of all manmade traffic

16:32.366 --> 16:34.026
passing over their airspace.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.578
-PETER: Hey, is that
a satellite?
-ADAM: Yep.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.544
NARRATOR: Including the
International Space Station,

16:39.624 --> 16:41.384
-or ISS.
-NICK: Adam,

16:41.459 --> 16:43.879
how are we
on the timing with the ISS?

16:43.961 --> 16:45.421
ADAM:
Uh, one more minute.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.546
NICK:
And which direction? West?

16:47.632 --> 16:50.762
Uh, it’s gonna be coming from
the west moving to the east.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.055
Look at how bright
this thing is.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.348
Whoa! Oh, there it is there.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.180
See?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.845
That’s the space station.
Can you see that?

16:57.934 --> 17:00.734
-ADAM: That is the ISS, yep.
-NICK: Okay.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.570
NARRATOR: While the
field team watches the sky,

17:04.649 --> 17:07.229
the remote viewers are sketching

17:07.318 --> 17:10.108
visual representations
of whatever comes to them.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.738
Incredibly, as
the International Space Station

17:13.866 --> 17:15.326
passes overhead,

17:15.409 --> 17:17.289
both women begin to draw

17:17.411 --> 17:20.661
virtually identical
rectangular objects.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.172
Well, it’s not a UFO,
but it’s still

17:24.252 --> 17:26.212
a pretty spectacular thing.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.125
Yeah, it’s pretty epic to see.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.513
NARRATOR:
After spotting a few other
satellites in the sky,

17:32.593 --> 17:35.053
Nick and Peter
notice a mysterious,

17:35.137 --> 17:37.057
fast-moving object,

17:37.139 --> 17:39.219
one that does not appear
to be a satellite.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.808
PETER: There’s one
right there right now.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.686
Look how quick it is.
Is that a satellite?

17:44.772 --> 17:46.692
I’ve got it on camera.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.034
-ADAM: Where you at?
-PETER: East,

17:49.110 --> 17:51.280
southeast.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.069
ADAM:
I see nothing on the tracker.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.447
PETER:
Can you see it up here, guys?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.577
Okay, I definitely saw it
up in that section

18:00.663 --> 18:02.623
of the sky with my naked eye.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.247
It-it just caught my attention
out of the corner of my eye.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.375
I turned around,
saw it for a few seconds,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.763
-and then it faded.
-That’s exactly what I saw.

18:11.841 --> 18:15.091
And there was nothing
on the monitor at all?

18:15.177 --> 18:17.467
Nope, nothing at all. That
section of the sky was clear.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.560
NICK:
And that’s, uh, satellites.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.642
What about aircraft
and flight paths?

18:23.728 --> 18:26.808
-Nope, everything was clear.
-NICK: Okay.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.569
Well, it was something.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.980
NARRATOR:
Did Nick Pope

18:31.068 --> 18:33.648
and the ECETI team spot

18:33.779 --> 18:37.159
an extraterrestrial object
in the night sky?

18:37.283 --> 18:40.163
One that inexplicably
disappeared?

18:40.286 --> 18:44.406
Perhaps the answer lies
with the remote viewing team,

18:44.498 --> 18:47.958
who not only detected
an object in the sky,

18:48.044 --> 18:49.464
but even got a glimpse

18:49.545 --> 18:52.125
of what was inside it.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.638
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

18:59.722 --> 19:02.102
we’ve investigated some pretty
extraordinary UFO reports,

19:02.183 --> 19:05.563
and during a trip Nick Pope
made to the ECETI Ranch in

19:05.686 --> 19:09.936
Washington state, we actually
caught a UFO on camera.

19:10.024 --> 19:13.694
And while Nick and the team
were watching this strange craft

19:13.819 --> 19:17.529
move across the night sky,
two remote viewers were

19:17.615 --> 19:21.915
stationed in a windowless room
drawing what they saw as well.

19:22.036 --> 19:26.536
The results
were absolutely amazing.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.675
NARRATOR: ECETI Ranch.
Trout Lake, Washington.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.344
The morning after
successfully capturing

19:34.423 --> 19:35.843
an anomalous object

19:35.925 --> 19:37.595
during their evening
sky watch session...

19:37.718 --> 19:40.048
-John, good to see you again.
-Good to see you, Nick.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.467
NARRATOR:
...Nick Pope meets up
with John Vivanco

19:42.556 --> 19:46.636
to see how the remote viewing
portion of the experiment went.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.347
Nick is eager to discover

19:48.437 --> 19:50.227
if the remote viewers picked up

19:50.314 --> 19:51.904
the same objects in the sky

19:51.982 --> 19:53.902
that he witnessed
with his own eyes,

19:53.984 --> 19:56.704
and perhaps even perceived

19:56.779 --> 20:00.119
additional details.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.531
So, the remote viewers

20:02.618 --> 20:04.698
were tasked

20:04.787 --> 20:06.747
on two different things
last night, and

20:06.872 --> 20:08.672
I wanted them to describe

20:08.749 --> 20:11.339
the first object
on the sky watch

20:11.419 --> 20:13.459
that was determined
to be a satellite.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.007
Right, so they have no idea

20:16.090 --> 20:18.590
that you are asking them
to look at a satellite...

20:18.718 --> 20:19.968
-No.
-...and that the satellite

20:20.094 --> 20:21.804
-is the target?
-Exactly.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.309
So, are you ready to go
through the first one?

20:23.431 --> 20:24.811
-Yes.
-Okay.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.271
So, this right here is energy.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.235
This is determined to be energy
by this remote viewer

20:32.314 --> 20:34.524
and talking about
how it’s crackling,

20:34.608 --> 20:36.898
hits and bounces of burst.
It’s like static.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.946
So, this is a mixture,
essentially, of

20:40.030 --> 20:42.160
almost like a
stream of consciousness,

20:42.283 --> 20:45.083
-what they are describing
here in words.
-JOHN: Right, exactly, right.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.541
-NICK: And then a visual
representation of it.
-JOHN: Right.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.911
Let me show you the next scan.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.828
This subject is talking about

20:51.959 --> 20:54.379
a dense material, thick gray,

20:54.462 --> 20:56.052
cylindrical object.

20:56.130 --> 21:00.010
Now, this different viewer is

21:00.134 --> 21:02.394
getting the same type of box.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.850
-It’s got lights blinking.
-NICK: And these are

21:04.972 --> 21:07.222
-completely independent
from each other?
-Right.

21:07.308 --> 21:10.018
NICK:
Wow. One, two,
pretty much the same.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.444
JOHN:
Pretty much the same.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.690
NICK:
Wow. Impressive.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.734
So, but let me
show you this here.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.816
There’s a burst of communication
is what I find interesting.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.743
And you have these, uh,
almost looks like

21:21.822 --> 21:22.912
solar panels on it.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.070
NICK:
Now, we actually saw

21:24.158 --> 21:25.578
the International Space Station

21:25.659 --> 21:27.999
last night,
and it actually has those

21:28.078 --> 21:29.658
two separate light panels,

21:29.789 --> 21:31.619
like, what makes it
different from most

21:31.707 --> 21:32.917
conventional satellites.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.880
Could this be what we’re
looking at here?

21:35.002 --> 21:36.922
JOHN:
Absolutely. If what you saw

21:37.004 --> 21:38.514
first identified as a satellite,

21:38.589 --> 21:40.129
-then, yeah, absolutely.
-NICK: Wow.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.626
NARRATOR:
Two separate remote viewers,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.428
both depicting objects

21:44.512 --> 21:46.222
that are consistent
with the makeup

21:46.347 --> 21:49.307
of the International
Space Station.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.561
It is an impressive coincidence,

21:51.685 --> 21:54.435
but not as impressive
as what John Vivanco

21:54.522 --> 21:57.772
is about to reveal to Nick Pope

21:57.858 --> 22:00.438
as concerns the mysterious UFO

22:00.528 --> 22:02.608
they spotted in the night sky.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.776
So, that’s a bona fide UFO.
We can’t explain that.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.196
And it blinked out,
it completely disappeared.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.458
What was the
first thing you saw?

22:11.539 --> 22:13.709
Well, the first anomalous thing

22:13.791 --> 22:15.921
we saw was a flash of light

22:16.043 --> 22:18.423
in the sky.
I saw it myself. We had

22:18.546 --> 22:20.256
a satellite tracker
up and running.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.841
We eliminated that possibility.
There was no satellite.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.185
So, this was anomalous.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.800
JOHN:
That’s interesting.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.846
So, we get to this page here.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.810
Now, they’re getting
an energy and a structure.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.480
It’s this reflective, metallic,
the feeling thing,

22:33.561 --> 22:35.311
almost like a mirage.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.686
Uh, glowing blue color,

22:37.773 --> 22:40.283
and very faint pinging sound.
That’s interesting.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.111
NICK:
This is a visual representation?

22:42.236 --> 22:43.646
This is...
visual representation.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.487
-So...
-And it says energy, so....

22:45.573 --> 22:46.493
JOHN:
Energy, right.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.284
Energy seems to be moving

22:48.409 --> 22:49.789
outward in many directions.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.330
So, I think what
they’re trying to do here is

22:51.412 --> 22:54.162
-display the energy, the ball.
-NICK: Right.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.168
All right,

22:56.250 --> 22:58.880
you prepared
to be weirded out here.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.751
NICK:
Okay.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.050
JOHN:
This subject is described,

23:03.132 --> 23:04.802
as a crystal blue color.

23:04.925 --> 23:08.095
It’s angelic and floaty.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.510
Wow.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.097
So, is this a person?
What is this?

23:13.183 --> 23:15.313
JOHN:
I’m not sure what this is.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.346
NICK:
This subject here, I mean, uh,

23:17.438 --> 23:20.358
this-this is clearly
some sort of person,

23:20.441 --> 23:22.481
I mean, or-or is it? I mean...

23:22.610 --> 23:24.360
-Well, this is...
-If we’re talking about
something anomalous,

23:24.445 --> 23:26.415
is the possibility here
that, if this

23:26.488 --> 23:29.068
was a UFO, that this is
some sort of occupant?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.078
JOHN:
There is that possibility.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.580
NARRATOR:
An occupant?

23:33.662 --> 23:35.412
Did this remote viewer

23:35.497 --> 23:37.917
actually see inside the object

23:38.000 --> 23:41.170
that the field team
witnessed from the ground?

23:41.295 --> 23:43.675
And if so,
could this confirm that

23:43.797 --> 23:47.677
what they saw was
an extraterrestrial spacecraft?

23:47.801 --> 23:50.261
JOHN:
This remote viewer

23:50.346 --> 23:52.966
is also getting a subject here,

23:53.098 --> 23:55.178
and they are calling
this flash of light

23:55.309 --> 23:58.099
a subject, which is curious.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.397
And when you see this,

23:59.480 --> 24:01.730
uppercase P and a lowercase P,

24:01.815 --> 24:04.355
they mean that subject
is a paraphysical,

24:04.485 --> 24:07.325
which means, in remote viewing,
it is something

24:07.404 --> 24:09.074
outside of our 3D reality.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.736
So, this subject,
according to this remote viewer,

24:11.825 --> 24:14.575
is a flash of light
on the mountain,

24:14.662 --> 24:17.712
and this subject exists
outside of our 3D reality.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.371
-That is spooky.
-Yeah.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.500
I mean, we saw a flash of light
on the mountain.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.125
Are we saying here that this

24:24.213 --> 24:26.473
flashing light on the mountain,
and that these

24:26.548 --> 24:29.838
sessions suggest that this is,
like, something to do with

24:29.927 --> 24:31.677
-extraterrestrials?
-You know,

24:31.804 --> 24:34.564
all I can say is

24:34.682 --> 24:36.482
what the remote viewers got, and

24:36.558 --> 24:39.138
from my perspective,

24:39.228 --> 24:41.188
I think you’ve got
a true anomaly there.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.443
Wow.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.025
NARRATOR:
Could the visions
described and illustrated

24:48.153 --> 24:50.953
by the remote viewers confirm
that what Nick Pope

24:51.031 --> 24:53.951
and the rest of the sky watch
investigators witnessed

24:54.034 --> 24:57.914
was, in fact,
an extraterrestrial craft?

24:58.038 --> 25:00.958
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

25:01.041 --> 25:04.751
and suggest further evidence
of an otherworldly

25:04.878 --> 25:08.128
presence visiting Earth
can be found by examining

25:08.215 --> 25:10.505
Chilean Navy footage of a UFO

25:10.592 --> 25:13.222
that defies explanation.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.139
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

25:20.227 --> 25:21.307
we have closely examined
UFO reports

25:21.395 --> 25:23.195
from around the globe.

25:23.272 --> 25:26.532
Reports that most governments
try to discredit.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.938
But in the South American
country of Chile,

25:29.069 --> 25:33.239
they’ve been openly
investigating UFOs for decades.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.953
In 2014,
the Chilean Navy captured

25:37.077 --> 25:40.997
footage of one of the most
incredible UFOs I’ve ever seen,

25:41.081 --> 25:45.131
and Dr. Travis Taylor
set out to investigate it.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.971
NARRATOR:
Just outside of Santiago,

25:54.094 --> 25:57.894
Chilean Navy officers aboard
an Airbus Cougar helicopter

25:57.973 --> 26:01.273
are testing a forward
looking infrared, or FLIR,

26:01.351 --> 26:02.981
high-definition camera.

26:03.103 --> 26:07.523
Suddenly, the camera
captures a strange object

26:07.608 --> 26:09.778
flying alongside them
at an altitude

26:09.860 --> 26:12.450
of 4,500 feet.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.449
After tracking it for
several minutes, they witness

26:15.532 --> 26:18.032
what appears to be
some sort of discharge

26:18.118 --> 26:21.198
coming from the craft.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.958
Cougar case
was a military helicopter

26:24.083 --> 26:25.503
back in 2014 that produced

26:25.626 --> 26:28.296
footage in an infrared camera.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.090
And we’re talking
about military equipment,

26:31.173 --> 26:34.683
we’re talking about millions
of dollars in equipment.

26:34.802 --> 26:37.512
It’s nine minutes long
that they have continuous

26:37.638 --> 26:39.178
infrared footage
of this phenomena.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.016
That’s really unprecedented.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.811
And if this phenomena
is going on for nine minutes,

26:43.894 --> 26:46.654
we can do analysis on it.

26:46.772 --> 26:50.482
NARRATOR:
On November 25, 2019,

26:50.609 --> 26:53.609
astrophysicist
Dr. Travis Taylor,

26:53.695 --> 26:55.155
traveled to Los Angeles,

26:55.239 --> 26:57.909
California to review
this incredible video

26:57.991 --> 27:01.621
with image analyst
Michael Bradbury.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.623
For more than a decade,
Bradbury has examined

27:04.706 --> 27:07.326
videos of alleged UFOs, looking

27:07.459 --> 27:09.669
for any signs that they
could be something

27:09.753 --> 27:11.463
other than manmade aircraft.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.047
The Chilean
helicopter video is really

27:14.174 --> 27:16.554
intriguing
and fascinating because

27:16.677 --> 27:20.137
you have this vehicle
or phenomena, whatever it is,

27:20.222 --> 27:24.142
and then it starts releasing
some type of material behind it.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.306
So, we absolutely need
to understand

27:26.395 --> 27:27.815
what this phenomena is.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.476
All right, here we go.

27:32.151 --> 27:35.611
So, this is from the, uh,
helicopter not far

27:35.696 --> 27:37.316
-from Santiago.
-Not far.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.316
-Uh, November of 2014.
-Okay.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.158
There’s the object,
and it’s only visible

27:42.244 --> 27:43.704
in infrared format.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.329
That’s really intriguing.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.294
The hi-def video.
It’s like it’s not even there.

27:47.374 --> 27:49.714
MICHAEL:
Two ground radar didn’t see it.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.133
The radar on the helicopter
could not pick it up.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.762
So, super unique
circumstances here.

27:55.883 --> 27:58.093
You got two hot spots,
and they’re separated.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.928
You know, that’s intriguing.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.513
I’ve never seen anything
like this in my life.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.808
NARRATOR:
Michael inverts the image

28:05.893 --> 28:09.103
so they can examine
the object’s shape more closely.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.609
MICHAEL:
What I’ve done here

28:10.731 --> 28:12.401
is taken the basic infrared,

28:12.482 --> 28:15.782
and I’ve just kind of flipped it
and adjusted it a little better

28:15.903 --> 28:17.863
for clarity purposes.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.236
-TRAVIS: You can clearly see
the shape of the...
-MICHAEL: Right.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.073
...vehicle,
or whatever the thing is.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.618
It’s peanut-shaped.
Why is it peanut-shaped?

28:23.744 --> 28:26.584
The pilot, his description was

28:26.663 --> 28:28.923
it had a flat body with

28:29.041 --> 28:31.421
these two, like,

28:31.501 --> 28:33.591
bright lenses or something.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.510
You know,
it kind of does look like two

28:35.589 --> 28:37.799
jet engines if you’re
looking at it from the back.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.095
But the motion on it looks
like it’s moving side to side,

28:41.220 --> 28:44.470
and the aspect ratio
doesn’t change on the circles.

28:44.598 --> 28:47.018
-It’s not going into the page,
as it should be.
-MICHAEL: No.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.440
TRAVIS:
There’s no other structure.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.519
-That’s the thing, if...
-No.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.314
You would see

28:52.439 --> 28:54.019
wings, a nose cone.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.777
-You wouldn’t
just see the engine.
-Right.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.399
TRAVIS:
You can look at a aircraft

28:57.486 --> 28:59.356
with a infrared camera,
and you see the structure

28:59.446 --> 29:01.406
-because it’s hot.
-MICHAEL: Right.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.780
-You got sun shining on it.
You go, you know...
-Exactly.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.946
the engine, the mechanics of it,
make it hot.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.287
That’s what I’m looking for here
is reflectivity off of

29:07.371 --> 29:09.331
-the physical structure,
and it’s not there.
-TRAVIS: There’s nothing.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.576
That kind of
throws that idea out.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.417
NARRATOR:
After isolating the object,

29:14.503 --> 29:17.883
Michael applies color filters
to better define

29:17.965 --> 29:20.845
the object’s unique heat
signature for closer analysis.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.678
TRAVIS:
Now, this one
is really interesting.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.394
MICHAEL:
This is adjusted, not altered.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.182
Sure. I got it. So, you’ve got
black is hot here.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.308
-Green is ambient
temperature I’m assuming.
-Yes.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.725
-Then white is cold.
-Correct.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.692
So here’s the thing,
there’s clearly

29:33.814 --> 29:36.404
a field of cold air around

29:36.483 --> 29:37.983
this thing that’s, um...

29:38.110 --> 29:39.610
that’s baffling.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.405
This thing, it’s hot, and then

29:41.488 --> 29:43.658
-instantly... it’s cold.
-Instantly cold.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.450
-And in nature,
that’s not how things work.
-No.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.245
There is a different
temperature bubble

29:48.328 --> 29:50.538
around the vehicle than there is

29:50.664 --> 29:52.424
-around normal vehicles.
-MICHAEL: Exactly.

29:52.499 --> 29:55.379
TRAVIS:
Which suggests
some type of-of field,

29:55.502 --> 29:56.842
whatever that means. Could be,

29:56.920 --> 29:59.510
you know, electrical,
magnetic, gravitational.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.881
We just don’t know,
but there is some sort of

30:02.009 --> 30:06.049
clear anomaly and some sort of
field around this craft.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.599
So, when does it start, uh,

30:08.682 --> 30:11.272
releasing the, uh, particulates?

30:11.351 --> 30:14.981
It does at about five minutes
into the video.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.233
TRAVIS:
So, right there,
now that’s really interesting.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.897
So, it’s very hot, right?
It’s saturated black.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.317
MICHAEL:
Very hot.

30:21.403 --> 30:23.743
So, again, in hi-def
you can’t see it.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.034
TRAVIS:
That means
it’s a temperature plume.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.906
It’s not necessarily
a particulate plume.

30:29.036 --> 30:32.746
Like, if you spray out jet fuel
from the back of a plane,

30:32.873 --> 30:34.833
it starts cooling off
almost immediately,

30:34.916 --> 30:36.536
and you even get
ice crystals in it, right?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.626
Absolutely, because it’s
affected by the atmosphere.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.882
This thing stays hot.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.265
MICHAEL:
And it holds its shape,

30:41.381 --> 30:42.801
which in itself,
is highly unusual.

30:42.883 --> 30:46.093
It doesn’t follow
standard fluid mechanics.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.509
-No. (laughs)
-You can try to debunk this
as just an earthly vehicle

30:49.598 --> 30:51.178
all you want to,
but I’ve never seen

30:51.266 --> 30:54.436
any earthly vehicle
that is explained this way.

30:55.729 --> 30:57.809
What on earth
could this thing be?

30:57.898 --> 31:00.018
One thing the analysis
has done for us is it--

31:00.108 --> 31:02.028
it’s allowed us
to sort of rule out,

31:02.110 --> 31:03.780
well, it’s not’s
a commercial airliner.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.414
Well, we didn’t have,
uh, radar tracks

31:05.530 --> 31:07.320
and transponder tracks,
so we know it wasn’t that.

31:07.407 --> 31:10.487
And then,
this wasn’t water or jet fuel

31:10.577 --> 31:12.117
or something of substance that,

31:12.245 --> 31:13.955
uh, the radar
would’ve picked up.

31:14.081 --> 31:16.671
So, this is something
that we’ve never seen before.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.498
NARRATOR:
Could the Chilean Navy
have captured footage

31:20.587 --> 31:23.337
of an extraterrestrial aircraft?

31:23.423 --> 31:27.053
Recently, military
whistleblowers have come forward

31:27.135 --> 31:30.755
to claim that, while
governments around the world

31:30.847 --> 31:34.927
may have become more transparent
about their UFO investigations,

31:35.018 --> 31:38.438
many are hiding even more
sensational evidence.

31:44.653 --> 31:48.203
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i> we’ve
examined dozens of eyewitness

31:48.281 --> 31:50.451
UFO reports from retired
military personnel, scientists,

31:50.534 --> 31:53.754
and whistleblowers who all claim
that the government is

31:53.829 --> 31:57.619
hiding the truth about
an alien presence on Earth.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.209
And in 2019,
investigative journalist

32:00.293 --> 32:02.713
Linda Moulton Howe
convinced a former

32:02.796 --> 32:06.256
Navy flight engineer to share
an incredible encounter

32:06.341 --> 32:09.551
that happened in the last place
you might expect,

32:09.636 --> 32:12.136
Antarctica.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.720
NARRATOR:
Scottsdale, Arizona,

32:14.808 --> 32:17.558
February 2019.

32:17.644 --> 32:21.024
Investigative journalist
Linda Moulton Howe

32:21.148 --> 32:23.608
arrives to conduct
an interview with a former

32:23.692 --> 32:26.862
Navy flight engineer who has
come forward with information

32:26.987 --> 32:29.067
about strange events
he witnessed

32:29.156 --> 32:31.696
during his time in Antarctica.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.454
(distorted):
I knew things that

32:34.536 --> 32:37.616
I-I felt needed to be

32:37.706 --> 32:39.666
put out in the mainstream.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.921
NARRATOR:
"Brian," as he prefers
to be called,

32:43.003 --> 32:44.713
requested that his face

32:44.838 --> 32:47.628
and voice be obscured
to protect his identity.

32:47.716 --> 32:51.006
His unit was based
on the southern tip

32:51.094 --> 32:53.474
of Ross Island at the
U.S. McMurdo Station,

32:53.555 --> 32:57.315
the main logistics hub
that services nearly all of

32:57.392 --> 33:00.062
the scientific outposts
on the continent.

33:00.187 --> 33:03.557
Brian, when did you
get into the Navy,

33:03.690 --> 33:06.360
and how did you get
to Antarctica?

33:06.443 --> 33:10.413
I enlisted in July of 1976.

33:10.530 --> 33:13.990
In order to go to Antarctica,

33:14.075 --> 33:15.985
you have to volunteer.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.787
It’s not a, uh, duty station
where you are ordered to go.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.633
I was able to get orders to, um,

33:22.709 --> 33:24.589
Antarctica Development
Squadron Six,

33:24.711 --> 33:28.051
which is referred to as VXE-6.

33:28.131 --> 33:31.511
And its mission would be
described as what, generally?

33:31.593 --> 33:34.973
BRIAN: The mission,
basically, was supplying

33:35.055 --> 33:37.815
to out-camps, uh,
science parties from

33:37.891 --> 33:41.351
McMurdo Station to South Pole,
back and forth.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.436
Talk about sort of the route,

33:44.564 --> 33:47.154
and what you guys began to see

33:47.234 --> 33:49.944
on a repeated basis.

33:50.070 --> 33:53.740
During our ’95, ’96 season,

33:53.865 --> 33:57.825
my crew was doing a lot
of back and forth to Pole.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.371
Mainly, it was cargo resupply,

34:00.455 --> 34:02.995
personnel exchanges.

34:03.083 --> 34:05.923
That season,
prior to us doing missions,

34:06.002 --> 34:11.052
we were told by some of
our officers that, if we saw

34:11.132 --> 34:12.842
something flying,

34:12.926 --> 34:14.716
that we weren’t
supposed to say anything.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.263
Oh, so you knew that...

34:17.347 --> 34:18.887
-BRIAN: Well...
-People had-- were already

34:18.974 --> 34:20.524
-warning about...
-BRIAN: Yeah.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.600
-...but you had not seen it.
-Right, so somewhere

34:21.726 --> 34:23.136
around December,

34:23.270 --> 34:25.980
uh, we were flying
a mission from McMurdo,

34:26.106 --> 34:28.436
and my loadmaster in the back,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.777
he gets on the intercom on
the ICS and he says, "Hey,

34:31.861 --> 34:33.201
"there’s something off
to the left here,

34:33.280 --> 34:34.660
kind of shimmering."

34:34.781 --> 34:36.411
So, I went up
to the flight deck,

34:36.491 --> 34:38.081
and I’m looking out
the big windows,

34:38.159 --> 34:41.289
and I see these little
disc-shaped objects.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.961
There was probably
four or five of them,

34:44.082 --> 34:46.712
and they were, at first,
when I first saw them,

34:46.793 --> 34:50.383
they were just stationary
over one mountain peak.

34:50.463 --> 34:53.263
And then, all of a sudden,
I’m looking at them,

34:53.341 --> 34:56.431
and one of them takes off
by itself and flies

34:56.511 --> 35:00.311
at incredible speed to the next
mountaintop and stops.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.432
And then another one
in the group takes off

35:02.517 --> 35:05.387
and heads toward
where the first one went.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.688
What did the pilot say?

35:07.814 --> 35:09.234
BRIAN:
(laughs) That was kind of funny.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.356
My pilot gets on the intercom,

35:11.484 --> 35:13.074
and he-he kind of jokingly goes,

35:13.153 --> 35:15.953
"Well, all I can tell you
is they’re not ours."

35:16.031 --> 35:18.281
Not ours?
What are you talking about?

35:18.366 --> 35:21.576
And then I think back
to the little brief we got

35:21.661 --> 35:24.371
about if we see something
down there, don’t say anything,

35:24.497 --> 35:27.167
if we see something else
flying around.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.542
So, now this all comes--
rings true, it’s like,

35:29.669 --> 35:32.089
so they weren’t just pulling
our leg and joking with us,

35:32.172 --> 35:34.722
there’s actually
something going on here.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.261
And it kept happening?

35:36.343 --> 35:38.893
Yes, it happened
at least two other times.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.098
NARRATOR:
Could Brian’s incredible story

35:43.183 --> 35:46.313
reveal that there are government
and military personnel

35:46.394 --> 35:48.654
who are aware of

35:48.730 --> 35:51.150
an extraterrestrial presence
on Earth?

35:51.232 --> 35:54.822
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

35:54.903 --> 35:56.613
and suggest

35:56.696 --> 35:59.866
even more compelling evidence
of otherworldly visitation

35:59.949 --> 36:01.829
may be found by examining

36:01.910 --> 36:04.500
alleged alien abductees

36:04.579 --> 36:08.039
and what might be hidden
beneath their skin.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.182
When it comes
to UFO investigations,

36:17.258 --> 36:19.548
no matter how many
sightings are reported,

36:19.636 --> 36:20.676
everyone wants the same thing:
physical evidence.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.392
A few years back,
I was invited to see

36:23.473 --> 36:25.433
a very bizarre and very

36:25.558 --> 36:30.308
intriguing collection of
what might be alien artifacts.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.902
NARRATOR:
Former law enforcement officer

36:36.986 --> 36:38.856
and investigator Derrel Sims

36:38.947 --> 36:42.407
has spent three decades
collecting evidence left behind

36:42.492 --> 36:45.372
at abduction scenes
throughout the country.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.293
DERREL:
I treat it as a crime scene.

36:48.415 --> 36:51.045
And to do that, you need to know
what to look for.

36:51.126 --> 36:53.536
In some of these cases,
we’ll find a burn mark,

36:53.628 --> 36:56.798
and in rare cases, radiation
traces where a UFO has landed.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.473
People will come back
with a scar like

37:00.593 --> 37:02.183
a dermatological scoop mark.

37:02.262 --> 37:05.012
And, sometimes, we find
some type of implant.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.848
Thank you for coming by,
Giorgio.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.443
NARRATOR:
In April 2016,

37:09.519 --> 37:11.519
Giorgio Tsoukalos met with

37:11.604 --> 37:13.654
Derrel Sims to get a closer look

37:13.773 --> 37:16.153
at some of the hard evidence
that Sims has collected

37:16.276 --> 37:18.526
through the years.

37:18.611 --> 37:22.911
One of the things
we found on these abductees

37:22.991 --> 37:24.951
is the alien leaves, like,

37:25.076 --> 37:26.156
-a fingerprint on them.
-Really?

37:26.286 --> 37:28.326
And when they touch them,
it leaves

37:28.455 --> 37:30.415
a subdermal mark
on you in the form of

37:30.498 --> 37:32.078
-fingerprints, or long fingers.
-Mm-hmm.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.577
And here’s an example.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.015
-It impacts the body
subdermally.
-TSOUKALOS: This is amazing.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.051
DERREL:
It literally goes into the skin,

37:40.133 --> 37:41.883
and you can’t wash it off,
you can’t get it off with

37:41.968 --> 37:43.798
any kind of, um,
solvent or anything.

37:47.474 --> 37:50.354
And here’s another good example.

37:50.477 --> 37:51.807
Here are some other handprints

37:51.895 --> 37:53.815
that we’ve found
around the world.

37:53.897 --> 37:54.977
This is in Chile.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.734
The lady got touched by this

37:56.816 --> 37:59.526
entity with huge prints
on both front and back

37:59.652 --> 38:01.402
and left caustic burns
on her body.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.608
-So, this was visible light.
-TSOUKALOS: Okay.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.278
This same handprint
literally shows up

38:05.366 --> 38:06.776
in several other cases as well.

38:06.868 --> 38:10.198
A little girl shows
the same exact hand.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.210
-This was fluorescence.
-TSOUKALOS: Mm-hmm.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.883
A police officer gets abducted.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.961
The entity actually comes
through the glass window

38:17.045 --> 38:20.765
and left the holographic
imagery in the glass.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.130
TSOUKALOS:
Very odd.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.967
DERREL:
Here’s one that fascinates me.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.392
This is a print

38:25.512 --> 38:27.602
that came off a wall
in Pennsylvania.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.890
The entire family are abductees,

38:29.015 --> 38:30.465
with the exception
of one person,

38:30.558 --> 38:32.728
and this one touched the wall,
and you can see

38:32.852 --> 38:35.692
the fluorescence there
where we lit it up.

38:35.772 --> 38:39.782
This is the case of a-a lady
that this is our

38:39.859 --> 38:41.649
long fingers-- you can see
the huge, long fingerprints

38:41.736 --> 38:44.776
and the suction cups
on these forefingers.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.824
And this is on her headboard.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.370
That’s fantastic.

38:50.495 --> 38:53.965
You’ve now spent many years
studying this.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.540
And you see
fingerprints like that,

38:57.627 --> 39:00.167
handprints and,
you know, residue,

39:00.255 --> 39:03.515
what is your theory
what we’re looking at here?

39:03.591 --> 39:05.971
DARREL: My estimation
as a former police officer

39:06.052 --> 39:09.012
is that there was
an oil-like substance

39:09.097 --> 39:12.307
that apparently exudes
from the body of the entity.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.892
TSOUKALOS:
That’s bizarre.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.024
NARRATOR:
Perhaps the most
intriguing evidence

39:18.106 --> 39:19.516
in Sims’ collection

39:19.607 --> 39:21.647
are the alleged
extraterrestrial implants

39:21.734 --> 39:24.904
retrieved from various victims.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.871
I want to show you
something rather remarkable.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.459
You can see
the little objects here.

39:34.581 --> 39:36.581
The perfect T,
and the one off to the side.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.958
TSOUKALOS:
Yes. Mm-hmm.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.591
So, we had them
surgically excised,

39:43.715 --> 39:45.805
and here’s what we found.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.795
-There’s a good look at them...
-Oh, wow.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.297
-Okay.
-...after they’re taken out.

39:51.014 --> 39:55.604
There was a biological cocoon
surrounding these originally.

39:55.685 --> 39:59.485
TSOUKALOS:
This is bizarre. And-and
what did they determine this is?

39:59.606 --> 40:01.266
We had this done
in a blinded study,

40:01.357 --> 40:02.897
Los Alamos, New Mexico Tech.

40:02.984 --> 40:05.114
They did a qualitative
and quantitative analysis.

40:05.194 --> 40:08.664
And they found, Giorgio,
you’re not gonna believe this.

40:08.781 --> 40:12.581
It turns out that the objects
are meteoric in origin.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.078
What’s your opinion then?

40:18.166 --> 40:20.286
And how did it get
into the woman’s body?

40:20.376 --> 40:22.336
In my opinion,

40:22.462 --> 40:23.802
what we’re looking at
are objects

40:23.880 --> 40:25.880
that have been installed
inside these people.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.255
Someone is doing this.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.104
This is entity related.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.061
So, in my opinion,
we’re looking at real,

40:35.141 --> 40:37.351
actual evidence of these cases.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.227
TSOUKALOS:
Well, this is amazing.

40:39.312 --> 40:42.192
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the implants

40:42.315 --> 40:45.075
collected from the bodies
of alleged abductees

40:45.151 --> 40:47.531
are of extraterrestrial origin?

40:47.654 --> 40:51.074
If the UFOs reported
in our skies

40:51.157 --> 40:54.327
belong to alien beings,
could it be

40:54.452 --> 40:56.702
that they are not
merely visitors to Earth,

40:56.829 --> 40:59.499
but have an agenda

40:59.582 --> 41:01.922
for humankind?

41:02.001 --> 41:05.381
The evidence that these
incredible encounters

41:05.505 --> 41:08.725
and sightings are real
can no longer be denied.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.301
And as governments
around the world

41:11.386 --> 41:14.846
begin to publicly acknowledge
the existence of UFOs,

41:14.931 --> 41:16.891
the truth will be revealed

41:17.016 --> 41:20.096
that, not only have we
been visited in the past,

41:20.186 --> 41:22.976
but that our
extraterrestrial teachers

41:23.064 --> 41:25.404
are still here today.
