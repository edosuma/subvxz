(Thomas) JANET, BELIEVE ME.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.792
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.224
BECAUSE HE'S OLD.
HE'S VERY, VERY OLD.

08:14.224 --> 08:15.966
DON'T MISTAKE
DR. YANG'S DISRESPECT

08:15.966 --> 08:17.728
FOR A SENSE OF HUMOR.

08:17.728 --> 08:18.799
SHE HASN'T GOT ONE.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.070
(laughs)
OH, NO, NO, NO.

08:20.070 --> 08:21.271
I-I RESPECT YOU.

08:21.271 --> 08:22.973
YOU'RE A HISTORICAL LANDMARK.

08:22.973 --> 08:23.934
CASE IN POINT.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.105
LIKE THE GRAND CANYON.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.276
KEEP IT UP.

08:26.276 --> 08:27.638
ONLY--ONLY OLDER.

08:27.638 --> 08:28.809
OH, ALL RIGHT. (chuckles)
ENOUGH.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.940
JUST A SMIDGE.
OH, MY GOD.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.082
A SMIDGE OLDER THAN THAT.
(laughs)

08:33.914 --> 08:35.586
(voice breaking)
I WORK OUT ALL THE TIME.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.087
I READ "MEN'S HEALTH."

08:37.087 --> 08:40.791
AND I DON'T EAT ANYTHING
I ACTUALLY WANT.

08:40.791 --> 08:43.123
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
I'M GONNA DIE?

08:43.123 --> 08:45.926
THIS TUMOR IS DIFFICULT
TO RESECT. IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
(crying)

08:47.928 --> 08:50.661
ROB, YOU'RE
IN PRIVATE SECURITY, RIGHT?

08:50.661 --> 08:52.132
YEAH, I'M A BODYGUARD.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.134
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT'S MY JOB, TOO.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.666
I HAVE YOUR BACK.

08:55.666 --> 08:57.708
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:57.708 --> 09:00.070
THIS TUMOR
IS JUST A LITTLE PUNK.

09:00.070 --> 09:02.172
(continues crying)

09:02.172 --> 09:03.714
(chokes back sob)

09:03.714 --> 09:05.015
(exhales)

09:05.015 --> 09:06.617
CAN I HAVE SOME TISSUE,
PLEASE?

09:08.579 --> 09:10.581
(tissues rustle)

09:10.581 --> 09:12.783
ANY QUESTIONS?

09:12.783 --> 09:14.024
WHEN YOU PERFORMED

09:14.024 --> 09:17.187
THAT TRANSCRANIAL RESECTION
OF CLIVAL CHORDOMA IN 2003,

09:17.187 --> 09:19.089
DID YOU REALIZE YOU'D BECOME
A MAJOR INFLUENCE

09:19.089 --> 09:20.861
ON SURGEONS AROUND THE WORLD?

09:20.861 --> 09:22.893
ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT CENTRAL LINES?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.638
OKAY, LOOK, I GET THAT YOU
WENT OVER THIS IN MED SCHOOL,

09:27.638 --> 09:29.640
BUT AS INTERNS,
YOU'RE GONNA BE ASKED

09:29.640 --> 09:31.041
TO INSERT CENTRAL LINES
EVERY DAY.

09:31.041 --> 09:33.143
DO IT INCORRECTLY,
AND THE PATIENT COULD DIE.

09:33.143 --> 09:34.845
I COULD BE WATCHING
A WHIPPLE RIGHT NOW.

09:34.845 --> 09:36.176
I HEARD THAT DR. WEBBER'S
HAS A PATIENT

09:36.176 --> 09:37.748
WITH SCROTAL LYMPHEDEMA.

09:37.748 --> 09:39.079
SCROTAL LYPHEDEMA?
STOP.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.951
LADIES.
(Shane) UH, DR. SHEPHERD.

09:40.951 --> 09:42.182
I HAVE A QUESTION
ABOUT CENTRAL LINES.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.353
GREAT. GO AHEAD.

09:43.353 --> 09:45.085
IN LEARNING TO INSERT
YOUR FIRST CENTRAL LINE,

09:45.085 --> 09:47.087
DID YOU DEVELOP ANY OF
THE SKILLS THAT CONTRIBUTED

09:47.087 --> 09:49.089
TO YOUR INFLUENTIAL
CLIVAL CHORDOMA RESECTION

09:49.089 --> 09:50.120
IN 2003?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.222
(interns moan
and speak indistinctly)

09:52.222 --> 09:54.064
DR. YANG, CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE?

09:54.064 --> 09:57.027
YOU KNOW,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:57.027 --> 09:58.368
(sighs)

09:58.368 --> 10:00.000
IS THIS GONNA TAKE LONG?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.131
JUST A QUICK QUESTION.

10:01.131 --> 10:03.934
DID YOU EVEN TRY TO SUGGEST
A LESS INVASIVE APPROACH?

10:03.934 --> 10:07.077
UH, YEAH. OF COURSE I DID.
A HYBRID SURGERY.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.378
ONLY ONE INCISION,
DONE IN HALF THE TIME.

10:08.378 --> 10:10.681
WHEN?
WHEN DID YOU SUGGEST IT?

10:10.681 --> 10:11.842
I DON'T KNOW. YESTERDAY.

10:11.842 --> 10:13.013
WHAT DID HE SAY?

10:13.013 --> 10:14.144
UH, AH, HE SAID,

10:14.144 --> 10:16.947
"ARE WE A HOSPITAL
OR A PIZZA DELIVERY SERVICE?"

10:16.947 --> 10:18.919
HE ASKED IF WE NEEDED IT DONE
IN 30 MINUTES OR LESS.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.121
(laughs)
HE IS SO STUBBORN.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.193
YEAH. UH, BUT HE'S NOT WRONG.

10:23.193 --> 10:25.625
I MEAN, HIS WAY MINIMIZES
THE RISK OF RECURRENT SHUNT.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.858
I MEAN, IT'S OLD-SCHOOL,
BUT I NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT--

10:27.858 --> 10:29.760
GOT IT. SOUNDS GREAT.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.101
OKAY. SO I CAN GO BACK?

10:31.101 --> 10:33.203
YEAH, GO, GO.
ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN.

10:33.203 --> 10:35.205
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:35.205 --> 10:37.037
WILL I BE OFF PROBATION SOON?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.168
JUST GO.

10:41.111 --> 10:43.974
(Catherine) MOST MEN WOULD JUST
BRING A GIRL FLOWERS.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.175
(elevator bell dings)

10:45.175 --> 10:49.149
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A VERY
DANGEROUS GAME WE'RE PLAYING.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
I'VE DONE MY BEST
TO KEEP JACKSON IN THE DARK

10:51.151 --> 10:54.324
ABOUT THE FURTHER ADVENTURES
OF CATHERINE AND RICHARD.

10:54.324 --> 10:56.386
WHICH IS WHY I MADE SURE
TO GRAB DR. QUAID

10:56.386 --> 10:58.228
FOR THE SKIN FLAP.

10:58.228 --> 11:00.791
THERE'S NO REASON JACKSON NEEDS
TO BE IN THAT O.R.

11:00.791 --> 11:02.232
MAYBE THAT'S A MISTAKE.

11:02.232 --> 11:04.234
I COME INTO TOWN
TO WORK ON A CASE

11:04.234 --> 11:06.296
THAT HAS
A LARGE PLASTICS COMPONENT

11:06.296 --> 11:08.899
AND DON'T BRING HIM IN?

11:08.899 --> 11:11.802
YOU SAYING,
IT SEEMS SUSPICIOUS?

11:11.802 --> 11:13.343
MAYBE.

11:13.343 --> 11:15.045
OH, MAYBE NOT.

11:15.045 --> 11:16.977
(chuckles)
IT'S JUST LIKE HIGH SCHOOL.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.408
(laughs) I KNOW.

11:18.408 --> 11:21.151
ISN'T IT FUN?

11:21.151 --> 11:24.114
(Miranda) OOH, WHEN YOU SAID YOU
WERE BUSY, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING.

11:24.114 --> 11:26.386
DR. BAILEY,
HOW NICE TO SEE YOU.
(chuckles) HI.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.059
UH, WHAT HAPPENED TO
YOUR SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION?

11:29.059 --> 11:30.220
CLEARED UP.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.361
HEY, YOU WOULDN'T NEED
AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS

11:31.361 --> 11:32.793
ON THOSE PUPPIES,
WOULD YOU?

11:32.793 --> 11:35.195
UM, W-WELL, ACTUALLY,
I WAS, UH,

11:35.195 --> 11:38.268
HOPING, UH, THAT APRIL KEPNER
COULD COME ABOARD.

11:38.268 --> 11:39.930
KEPNER?

11:39.930 --> 11:42.102
YEAH, I'M, YOU KNOW, I'M--
I'M TAKING HER UNDER MY WING.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.975
SHE'S FRAGILE.
Y-YOU UNDERSTAND.

11:44.975 --> 11:48.138
THAT IS A GIANT SCROTUM.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

11:48.138 --> 11:49.279
I'M SORRY, BAILEY.

11:49.279 --> 11:51.411
UM, N-NEXT TIME.

11:55.986 --> 11:58.248
(laughs)

11:58.248 --> 11:59.349
HEY.

11:59.349 --> 12:00.921
YOU'RE THE PROSTHETIST?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.252
YEAH.

12:02.252 --> 12:04.124
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT'D MAKE
A GOOD TITLE FOR A MOVIE.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.125
HEY, DAVID MOORE.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.296
ALEX KAREV, PEDS.

12:06.296 --> 12:07.998
UM, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR DR. ROBBINS,

12:07.998 --> 12:09.229
SHE'S OVER IN THE CLINIC.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.301
WE'RE ABOUT TO DO A PLASTER CAST
OF HER RESIDUAL LIMB.

12:11.301 --> 12:12.462
BUT YOU'VE GOT
A FEW MINUTES.

12:12.462 --> 12:13.834
OH, NO, THAT'S COOL.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.005
I WAS, UH, I WAS JUST HOPING

12:15.005 --> 12:16.166
THAT YOU COULD TELL ME
HOW SHE'S DOING.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.839
ANY SCAR TISSUE
OR CONTRACTURES?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.210
NO. SO FAR, SO GOOD.

12:20.210 --> 12:21.912
ALL RIGHT.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.914
HOW SOON BEFORE
SHE'S BACK UP ON HER FEET?

12:23.914 --> 12:25.215
THAT'S A LITTLE HARDER
TO SAY.

12:25.215 --> 12:27.417
I SHOULD HAVE A BETTER IDEA
AFTER TOMORROW, THOUGH.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.279
TELL HER YOU STOPPED BY?

12:29.279 --> 12:31.181
NO, NO, DON'T,
BECAUSE, UH, I DIDN'T.

12:31.181 --> 12:34.184
(people speaking indistinctly)

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
ALL RIGHT.
KEEP TRYING, FOLKS.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.860
NOBODY GETS IT THE FIRST TIME.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.033
OR THE 40th TIME,
APPARENTLY.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.394
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO LOCATE THE VEIN.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.296
OKAY, GIVE IT TO ME.

12:46.296 --> 12:48.939
I, UH...

12:48.939 --> 12:52.202
(indistinct conversations)

12:52.202 --> 12:54.044
UM...

12:54.044 --> 12:55.806
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

12:55.806 --> 12:58.208
VISUALIZE THE ANATOMY.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.280
SUBLCAVIAN VEIN
IS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.781
OKAY,
WALK IT UP THE CLAVICLE.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.954
OKAY. WATCH ON THE ANGLE.
NOT TOO DEEP.

13:03.954 --> 13:05.315
I SEE IT.

13:05.315 --> 13:07.487
MM. WATCH YOUR ANGLE.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.359
BOOM.

13:09.359 --> 13:10.821
THAT'S ARTERIAL BLOOD.

13:10.821 --> 13:12.492
HE'S GONNA BLEED TO DEATH.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.364
SO NOT BOOM?

13:14.364 --> 13:16.196
NO.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.128
NOT BOOM.

13:24.935 --> 13:26.036
(sighs) YOU'VE GOTTA
WORK AROUND THE AZYGOS

13:26.036 --> 13:28.108
AND THE HEMIAZYGOS VEINS.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.941
THERE'S FATTY TISSUE,
LYMPH NODES, LYMPHATIC TISSUE,

13:30.941 --> 13:33.013
AND THE SYMPATHETIC CHAINS,

13:33.013 --> 13:34.514
NOT TO MENTION THE FACT

13:34.514 --> 13:38.849
THAT THE TUMOR HAS LIFTED UP
THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA

13:38.849 --> 13:41.451
AND IS ADHERENT
TO THE AORTA.

13:41.451 --> 13:44.154
THIS IS A MESS.

13:44.154 --> 13:45.325
I KNOW.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.427
SO HOW DO WE GET
THE ENTIRE MASS

13:47.427 --> 13:50.000
WITHOUT HAVING TO RESECT
THE AORTA?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.301
I HAVE NO IDEA.

13:51.301 --> 13:53.003
YEAH, I'M HAPPY TO TAKE
THIS OFF YOUR HANDS.

13:53.003 --> 13:56.366
I CALLED YOU FOR AN OPINION,
NOT TO STEAL MY SURGERY.

13:56.366 --> 13:59.910
N-NO FIRST-YEAR ATTENDING
IN HER RIGHT MIND

13:59.910 --> 14:02.272
IS GONNA WANT TO TAKE ON
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.574
I MEAN, NOT WHEN
FULL RESPONSIBILITY

14:04.574 --> 14:06.576
FOR EVERY DECISION
MADE IN THE O.R.

14:06.576 --> 14:08.548
FALLS ON HER SHOULDERS.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.920
MINE.

14:11.982 --> 14:13.123
DON'T COME CRYING TO ME

14:13.123 --> 14:14.624
WHEN A MAN'S BLEEDING OUT
ON YOUR TABLE

14:14.624 --> 14:16.226
JUST 'CAUSE
YOU THINK YOU BAD.

14:16.226 --> 14:17.958
OH, SHE'S BAD.
(elevator bell dings)

14:17.958 --> 14:20.360
YEAH, WE'LL SEE.
(sighs)

14:20.360 --> 14:24.394
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS I'M LOOKING AT.

14:24.394 --> 14:26.997
THOSE ARE TESTICLES,
DR. KEPNER.
(beeping)

14:26.997 --> 14:29.069
(chuckles) DON'T WORRY,
SWEETHEART.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.440
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LOOK LIKE THAT.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.942
(laughs) I KNOW
WHAT TESTICLES ARE S--

14:31.942 --> 14:33.944
(beeps)

14:33.944 --> 14:35.946
JACKSON DIDN'T MENTION
THAT YOU WERE COMING.

14:35.946 --> 14:37.147
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

14:37.147 --> 14:38.979
HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR,
HE WOULD LIKE ME

14:38.979 --> 14:41.151
TO STAY OUT
OF HIS PERSONAL BUSINESS,

14:41.151 --> 14:43.253
SO I AM DOING MY BEST.

14:43.253 --> 14:44.915
WELL, I THINK THAT'S GREAT.

14:44.915 --> 14:46.987
I'VE MADE NO SUCH PROMISES
TO YOU.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.390
YOU NEED TO START PREPPING
FOR NEXT YEAR'S BOARDS.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.492
THERE'S A FELLOW
IN OUR GYNECOLOGY DEPARTMENT

14:52.492 --> 14:54.364
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT TUTOR.

14:54.364 --> 14:56.466
AND HE'S CUTE.

14:56.466 --> 14:57.998
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT REALLY
EVEN NEC--

14:57.998 --> 15:00.200
I SAID IT BEFORE,
AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.901
YOU'RE JUST TOO UPTIGHT,
BABY.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.534
YOU NEED TO GET L-A-I-D.

15:04.534 --> 15:05.905
DR. AVERY.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.007
LOOK AT ME.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.908
LOOK AT ME.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.412
I AM HAVING THE BEST SEX
I HAVE HAD IN YEARS.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.583
(elevator bell dings)
MM-HMM.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.685
AND IT'S JUST OPENED ME UP
LIKE A FLOWER,

15:15.685 --> 15:18.088
BLOSSOMING TOWARDS THE SUN.

15:18.088 --> 15:19.219
MM.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.191
THAT'S A POWERFUL IMAGE.

15:21.191 --> 15:23.523
I BET THAT FELLOW KNOWS
HIS WAY AROUND A WOMAN.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.654
(chuckles)

15:24.654 --> 15:26.526
OH, RELAX. I'M KIDDING.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.697
(laughs)

15:27.697 --> 15:29.659
SEE THAT?
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

15:29.659 --> 15:31.261
UPTIGHT.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.063
BUT I WILL
GIVE YOU HIS NUMBER,

15:33.063 --> 15:35.035
JUST IN CASE.

15:37.007 --> 15:38.508
(indistinct conversations)

15:38.508 --> 15:40.210
(siren wailing)

15:40.210 --> 15:41.541
(clears throat)

15:41.541 --> 15:43.073
(Jackson) HEY, DR. WEBBER.
(door opens)

15:43.073 --> 15:44.214
DR. WEBBER.

15:44.214 --> 15:45.545
UM, YES, SIR.

15:45.545 --> 15:48.118
WHY IS MY NAME ON
TOMORROW'S O.R. SCHEDULE

15:48.118 --> 15:50.050
FOR A SCROTAL LYMPHEDEMA SURGERY
WITH YOU?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.651
UH, GOT THE WRONG AVERY.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.124
I'M DOING THE SURGERY
WITH YOUR--YOUR MOTHER.

15:54.124 --> 15:55.185
MY MOTHER'S HERE

15:55.185 --> 15:56.956
PERFORMING A SURGERY

15:56.956 --> 15:58.188
WITH YOU?

15:58.188 --> 16:01.031
B-BUT WE WERE HOPING
THAT YOU'D BE AVAILABLE

16:01.031 --> 16:02.362
TO DO A SKIN FLAP.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.995
ACTUALLY, SHE SENT ME
TO FIND YOU FOR A CONSULT.

16:04.995 --> 16:07.067
O-OKAY, SURE.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.438
YEAH, I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

16:08.438 --> 16:09.669
GREAT.

16:09.669 --> 16:12.602
(indistinct conversations
continue)

16:12.602 --> 16:15.075
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES, OKAY?

16:15.075 --> 16:16.706
IT'S FINE.

16:16.706 --> 16:18.608
(footsteps approach)

16:18.608 --> 16:20.180
OH.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.052
UH...

16:22.052 --> 16:24.484
SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE READY.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.157
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
CHECK YOUR VOICE MAIL.

16:27.157 --> 16:28.688
YOU JUST LOOKED
TO SEE WHO CALLED.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.091
IF YOU HAD CHECKED
YOUR FREAKIN' VOICE MAIL,

16:31.091 --> 16:33.063
THEN YOU WOULD KNOW THAT I WAS
STILL GONNA BE HERE A WHILE,

16:33.063 --> 16:37.167
BECAUSE YOU WOULD'VE GOTTEN
THE FREAKIN' MESSAGE!

16:37.167 --> 16:39.069
I'LL COME BACK.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.472
(door opens)

16:42.472 --> 16:45.135
(door closes)

16:45.135 --> 16:46.476
YOU KNOW, MY--MY BROTHER,

16:46.476 --> 16:49.679
HE NEVER CHECKS
HIS VOICE MAIL EITHER.

16:49.679 --> 16:52.182
IT'S MADDENING.

16:54.284 --> 16:55.585
DEREK MUST BE SO PROUD.

16:55.585 --> 16:58.288
YOU'LL BE, LIKE,
MR. AND MRS. IMPOSSIBLE TUMOR.

16:58.288 --> 16:59.549
BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

16:59.549 --> 17:01.151
I MEAN, HE'S NOT
MR. IMPOSSIBLE TUMOR ANYMORE.

17:01.151 --> 17:03.022
And I don't want to rub
his nose in it.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.754
He's trying to be
so cheery about teaching.

17:04.754 --> 17:06.656
AW. THAT'S SO SAD.

17:06.656 --> 17:08.228
IT'S NOT SAD.
IT'S JUST AN ADJUSTMENT.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.400
Can you imagine
never doing surgery again?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.561
I CAN. I DO.

17:11.561 --> 17:13.163
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T
SEE THIS COMING.

17:13.163 --> 17:15.735
So I just try to enjoy it
while I can.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.508
OH, MY GOD.
HE DOESN'T SEE IT COMING.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.570
OH, MY GOD. THANKS, MER.
I GOTTA GO.

17:20.570 --> 17:22.572
OKAY.
(beeps)

17:22.572 --> 17:24.074
(sighs)

17:25.345 --> 17:27.777
OH, I HATE TEACHING.

17:27.777 --> 17:29.119
YOU LOVE TEACHING.

17:29.119 --> 17:31.050
I JUST NEVER REALIZED
HOW MUCH I RELY ON

17:31.050 --> 17:32.422
JUST HAVING THEM BE ABLE
TO WATCH ME DO THE THING.

17:32.422 --> 17:34.654
WELL, I USED TO LOVE IT
WHEN YOU STOOD BEHIND ME

17:34.654 --> 17:36.126
AND WHISPERED INSTRUCTIONS
IN MY EAR.

17:36.126 --> 17:37.757
WELL, I CAN'T DO THAT
WITH ALL THE KIDS.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.129
(laughs)

17:39.129 --> 17:40.630
HOW ARE YOU?
(babbling)

17:40.630 --> 17:42.462
YES, I KNOW.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.134
SO I'M GUESSING YOUR INTERN
DIDN'T LIKE FINDING OUT

17:44.134 --> 17:46.196
SHE WAS WRONG
ABOUT THE TUMOR.

17:46.196 --> 17:48.698
NO, SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT
AT ALL.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.405
(exhales)

17:55.405 --> 17:56.576
THIS IS THE LAST TIME.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.747
THE LAST TIME
WAS THE LAST TIME.

17:57.747 --> 17:59.409
YEAH, BUT THIS IS THE LAST
LAST TIME.

17:59.409 --> 18:01.181
I HAVE TO BE IN THE O.R.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.213
ALL DAY TOMORROW
WITH YOUR MOM.

18:03.213 --> 18:04.614
YOU'RE IN THAT SURGERY, TOO?

18:04.614 --> 18:07.257
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, TOO?
WAIT. YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE?

18:07.257 --> 18:09.119
YEAH.
NO, NO, NO.

18:09.119 --> 18:10.590
WE CANNOT BOTH BE
IN THAT O.R.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.522
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

18:12.522 --> 18:15.165
SHE IS OBSESSED
WITH MY SEX LIFE.

18:15.165 --> 18:17.197
SHE'S HAVING AMAZING SEX,
SO I HAVE TO, TOO.

18:17.197 --> 18:18.528
GA--WH--

18:18.528 --> 18:20.330
SORRY. SORRY.
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.132
WEBBER'S STILL BANGING
MY MOM.

18:22.132 --> 18:23.733
THAT'S WHO SHE CALLED
THE BEST SEX OF HER LIFE?

18:23.733 --> 18:25.805
OHH.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.438
AND WE'RE DONE HERE.

18:28.438 --> 18:29.609
(bell on door jingles)

18:29.609 --> 18:30.780
(indistinct conversations)

18:30.780 --> 18:32.142
WHITE WINE.

18:32.142 --> 18:33.313
(man) WHAT KIND?

18:33.313 --> 18:34.284
THE BIG KIND?

18:34.284 --> 18:35.885
TORRES, IT'S LATE.

18:35.885 --> 18:37.447
YEAH. (exhales)

18:37.447 --> 18:39.149
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY

18:39.149 --> 18:41.721
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS
COUPLES FIGHT ABOUT IS MONEY?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.253
TURNS OUT MONEY FIGHTS

18:43.253 --> 18:44.654
AIN'T GOT NOTHING
ON AN AMPUTATION FIGHT.

18:44.654 --> 18:46.196
I CAN IMAGINE.

18:46.196 --> 18:47.657
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T GET MAD
OR YELL,

18:47.657 --> 18:50.460
BECAUSE THEN I'M THE WOMAN
YELLING AT HER ONE-LEGGED WIFE.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.631
SO I'VE BEEN SLEEPING
AT MARK'S,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.163
BUT... (inhales deeply)

18:53.163 --> 18:55.205
I DON'T THINK I CAN TAKE
ANOTHER NIGHT

18:55.205 --> 18:56.806
IN MY DEAD BEST FRIEND'S BED.

18:56.806 --> 18:58.508
IT JUST REMINDS ME
THAT HE'S GONE,

18:58.508 --> 19:00.670
AND I END UP HAVING
THE WORST DREAMS.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.512
IT'S GETTING SO BAD, I EVEN
CONSIDERED ASKING SHEPHERD

19:02.512 --> 19:04.344
IF I COULD CRASH IN HIS TRAILER
IN THE WOODS.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.176
MM. THAT'S PRETTY BAD.

19:06.176 --> 19:09.148
YEP.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.750
SORRY. THAT WAS A LOT.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.282
OH, I ASKED.

19:12.282 --> 19:13.583
I'M NOT SURE YOU DID.
(chuckles)

19:13.583 --> 19:15.185
IT'S FINE.

19:15.185 --> 19:16.586
(sighs)

19:16.586 --> 19:19.158
(sighs) HONESTLY...

19:19.158 --> 19:21.561
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING
TOO WELL, EITHER.

19:21.561 --> 19:22.932
(bell on door jingles)

19:22.932 --> 19:24.294
(sighs)

19:24.294 --> 19:25.435
WANT ANOTHER?

19:25.435 --> 19:26.596
UH, YEAH.

19:26.596 --> 19:27.767
YEAH?

19:27.767 --> 19:28.938
(laughs) YEAH.

19:28.938 --> 19:30.670
HE'LL HAVE ANOTHER.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.372
NOT TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY,

19:32.372 --> 19:34.704
BUT THAT'S THE WORST TIE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

19:34.704 --> 19:35.875
(laughs)

19:35.875 --> 19:39.209
I'M SORRY. (laughs)

19:39.209 --> 19:41.211
(sighs)
(chuckles)

19:41.211 --> 19:43.213
(knock on door)

19:43.213 --> 19:46.416
YEAH, COMING. (pants)

19:48.418 --> 19:50.690
WELL, HEY THERE.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.363
UH, I DIDN'T KNOW WE, UH--

19:53.363 --> 19:56.326
WE'RE NOT. WHAT'S YOUR DEAL
WITH DR. THOMAS?

19:56.326 --> 19:58.868
YOU CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT
CRAIG THOMAS?

19:58.868 --> 20:00.700
WELL, COLOR ME DISAPPOINTED.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.532
YOU SAID, "ENJOY HIM
WHILE YOU CAN."

20:02.532 --> 20:04.304
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:04.304 --> 20:05.775
UM...

20:05.775 --> 20:06.976
COME ON IN.

20:06.976 --> 20:08.778
IT'S COLD.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.541
ARE YOU FIRING HIM?

20:14.344 --> 20:16.486
WE CAN'T FIRE HIM.

20:16.486 --> 20:18.217
WE CAN...

20:18.217 --> 20:19.919
FORCE HIM TO RETIRE,
THOUGH.

20:21.751 --> 20:23.693
LISTEN, TELLING YOU THIS

20:23.693 --> 20:26.556
BREAKS A WHOLE BUSHEL
OF BOARD REGULATIONS.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.398
TELL ME ONE MISTAKE
HE'S MADE.

20:28.398 --> 20:30.630
HE HASN'T. NOT YET.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.432
BUT WHEN HE DOES,

20:32.432 --> 20:34.764
HIS AGE WILL MAKE IT
AN INSTANT MALPRACTICE SUIT

20:34.764 --> 20:36.436
THAT WE WILL LOSE.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.438
HE'S YEARS BEHIND
THE MEDICAL EDUCATION CURVE.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.510
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

20:40.510 --> 20:43.242
HE REFUSED TO TRY
A MINIMALLY INVASIVE TECHNIQUE.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.374
WHY,

20:44.374 --> 20:46.376
BECAUSE HE'S STUBBORN

20:46.376 --> 20:49.018
OR BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW?

20:49.018 --> 20:52.382
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE HAD ME
WORKING WITH HIM.

20:52.382 --> 20:54.624
WELL, YEAH, YOU REPRESENT
EVERYTHING THAT IS

20:54.624 --> 20:58.257
NEW AND SMART AND ADVANCED
IN OUR FIELD.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.329
YOU'RE HIS OPPOSITE.

20:59.329 --> 21:01.731
AND WHEN THE TIME COMES
TO MAKE A CASE,

21:01.731 --> 21:03.733
IT WON'T HURT TO HAVE YOU
HELP US DO IT.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.395
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.

21:05.395 --> 21:06.896
ETHICALLY, NO.

21:06.896 --> 21:08.638
ETHICALLY, YES.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.841
YOU SHOULD HAVE.

21:11.841 --> 21:13.373
HONESTLY,
I NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT

21:13.373 --> 21:14.604
YOU'D HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.883
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

21:23.883 --> 21:24.854
YOU DESCRIBED THEM AS,

21:24.854 --> 21:26.916
"SO BIG, A SHEET
COULDN'T COVER THEM."

21:26.916 --> 21:28.988
I MAY HAVE EXAGGERATED.

21:28.988 --> 21:33.022
OKAY, LADIES,
THIS ISN'T A SIDESHOW.

21:34.063 --> 21:36.496
GENTLEMEN, STEP RIGHT UP.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.898
(people speaking indistinctly)

21:38.898 --> 21:39.869
THAT'S IT?

21:41.631 --> 21:42.632
(elevator bell dings)

21:42.632 --> 21:44.574
OKAY.
THAT'S NOT OKAY.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.608
OH, GREAT. KAREV'S HERE.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.580
HERE TO MAKE US ALL LAUGH
WITH FUNNY JOKES

21:50.580 --> 21:52.682
ABOUT MY HANDS
ON A MAN'S PARTS.

21:52.682 --> 21:54.043
THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

21:54.043 --> 21:56.646
THAT POOR GUY.

21:56.646 --> 21:58.618
I KNOW.

21:58.618 --> 22:01.691
CAN YOU IMAGINE
BECOMING SO SWOLLEN

22:01.691 --> 22:03.953
THAT A SURGEON
NEEDS TO USE A SCALPEL

22:03.953 --> 22:06.055
TO DIG OUT
ALL THAT EXCESS TISSUE

22:06.055 --> 22:09.028
UNTIL THE TESTICLES AND CORDS
HIT THE OPEN AIR?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.360
I MEAN, WHO EVEN KNOWS

22:10.360 --> 22:11.931
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS PENIS
IN ALL THAT MESS?

22:11.931 --> 22:14.934
THAT'S NOT OKAY.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.766
(laughs) NICE.

22:16.766 --> 22:18.107
(lowered voice) YOUR MOTHER

22:18.107 --> 22:20.640
WON'T STOP ASKING ME
WHY I LOOK SO TIRED.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.071
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO TIRED?

22:22.071 --> 22:25.745
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

22:25.745 --> 22:28.047
THEY LOOK SO CUTE TOGETHER.
SHUT UP.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.018
THINK THEY LOOK TIRED?

22:29.018 --> 22:30.380
GO TO HELL.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.482
(laughs)

22:32.482 --> 22:34.023
THE HYBRID SURGERY
WAS A GOOD PITCH.

22:34.023 --> 22:35.354
YES, IT WAS.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.926
SO WHY AREN'T WE DOING IT?

22:36.926 --> 22:38.928
BECAUSE WE HAVE
A SURGICAL PLAN.

22:38.928 --> 22:40.089
MM.

22:40.089 --> 22:41.591
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
DR. YANG?

22:41.591 --> 22:43.092
NOPE.
BUT I THINK YOU DO.

22:43.092 --> 22:46.095
I THINK YOU REJECT MY PITCHES
BECAUSE THEY SCARE YOU.

22:46.095 --> 22:48.097
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
LEARNING SOMETHING FROM ME.

22:48.097 --> 22:49.499
I HAVE.

22:49.499 --> 22:51.901
I HAVE LEARNED THAT MORTALITY
IS BREATHING DOWN YOUR NECK,

22:51.901 --> 22:53.142
AND YOU ARE
RUNNING FROM THE FUTURE

22:53.142 --> 22:54.674
LIKE A SCARED OLD CHICKEN.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.005
I WON'T CHANGE MY PLAN
JUST BECAUSE--

22:56.005 --> 22:57.477
WON'T OR CAN'T?

22:57.477 --> 22:58.978
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE

22:58.978 --> 23:01.110
OF THREADING A CATHETER,
DR. YANG.

23:01.110 --> 23:03.713
PROVE IT.
PROVE ME WRONG.

23:03.713 --> 23:06.986
(indistinct conversations)

23:09.519 --> 23:11.691
TAKE A DEEP BREATH
FOR ME, BRYAN.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.063
GOOD.
AND LET IT OUT.

23:14.063 --> 23:17.527
(exhales)

23:17.527 --> 23:19.028
UM...

23:19.028 --> 23:21.070
WH-WHAT ABOUT
MY RECOVERY TIME?

23:21.070 --> 23:23.072
I MEAN, IS THERE ANY CHANCE

23:23.072 --> 23:25.505
I WON'T BE ABLE
TO WALK FOR A WHILE?

23:25.505 --> 23:26.676
GOD, BRYAN.

23:26.676 --> 23:28.508
STOP HIDING
FROM AMY MILLER.

23:28.508 --> 23:29.679
I'M NOT. (scoffs)

23:29.679 --> 23:31.010
SHE PROBABLY WON'T EVEN
BE AT THE REUNION.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.942
SHE WILL. SHERYL THOMPSON
TOLD ME SO.

23:32.942 --> 23:34.584
ALSO SAID SHE'S SINGLE.

23:34.584 --> 23:37.447
YOU'RE NOT THAT SKINNY KID
FROM ROCKETRY CLUB ANYMORE.

23:37.447 --> 23:40.620
YOU'RE SMART. YOU'RE FUNNY.
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH FOR AMY.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.091
ACTUALLY,
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR AMY.

23:42.091 --> 23:43.993
YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT GUY
EXCEPT--

23:43.993 --> 23:45.755
EXCEPT I'VE GOT GIANT BALLS?

23:45.755 --> 23:47.627
NO!

23:47.627 --> 23:50.129
EXCEPT THAT YOU DON'T.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.533
(Miranda)
IT'S A GOOD TRADE, GREY.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.705
MY TWO
LEISURELY ABDOMINAL SURGERIES

23:55.705 --> 23:58.137
FOR JUST
ONE RETROCRURAL TUMOR.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.869
THIS IS
GETTING A LITTLE SAD.

23:59.869 --> 24:01.170
NO, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S SAD.

24:01.170 --> 24:02.712
MEREDITH GREY FLAMING OUT
'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW

24:02.712 --> 24:03.873
A GOOD BARGAIN
WHEN SHE SEES ONE.

24:03.873 --> 24:05.014
(door opens)
(Brooks) STOP, MR. MAYS.

24:05.014 --> 24:07.016
MR. MAYS!

24:07.016 --> 24:09.018
MR. MAYS, STOP!

24:09.018 --> 24:11.050
SHOULD'VE MADE
THE TRADE.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.682
(April) UH, DR. BAILEY.

24:12.682 --> 24:15.154
HEY, UM, I MIGHT BE
INTERESTED IN A TRADE.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.155
(elevator bell dings)

24:16.155 --> 24:18.488
HE'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

24:18.488 --> 24:20.089
I MEAN, DO I CALL FOR BACKUP?
DO I GET A NET OR WHAT?

24:20.089 --> 24:21.631
FORGET IT.

24:21.631 --> 24:25.134
(Rob panting)

24:25.134 --> 24:28.067
I WOULD OPERATE OUT HERE,

24:28.067 --> 24:29.699
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S PARTICULARLY STERILE.

24:29.699 --> 24:31.000
YOU LIED TO ME.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.171
I DIDN'T.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.142
THAT INTERN WAS IN THE HALLWAY

24:33.142 --> 24:34.574
BRAGGING TO
ALL HER LITTLE FRIENDS

24:34.574 --> 24:36.546
ABOUT
MY ONCE-IN-A-CAREER TUMOR.

24:36.546 --> 24:39.509
SHE SAID YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE GONNA START.

24:39.509 --> 24:42.512
(siren wailing)

24:44.253 --> 24:46.085
(exhales deeply)

24:46.085 --> 24:48.758
WITH A TUMOR LIKE THIS,
NO SURGEON WOULD

24:48.758 --> 24:50.790
UNTIL YOU'RE OPEN
AND ON THE TABLE

24:50.790 --> 24:53.062
AND I CAN GET A LOOK
AT THE THING.

24:53.062 --> 24:54.994
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S TERRIFYING.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.495
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.827
YOU'RE AN EMOTIONAL GUY.

24:57.827 --> 25:00.129
(exhales)

25:00.129 --> 25:02.171
(laughs)

25:02.171 --> 25:03.973
NOT USUALLY.

25:03.973 --> 25:05.134
I MEAN, AT WORK,

25:05.134 --> 25:07.006
I'M IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS
ALL THE TIME.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.008
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE CLIENT.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.940
SO I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO FREAK OUT.

25:10.940 --> 25:13.242
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M FREAKING OUT.

25:13.242 --> 25:15.585
OKAY. WELL, TODAY YOU'RE
ALLOWED, BECAUSE I WON'T.

25:17.747 --> 25:20.249
TH-THAT INTERN'S GOT
A BIG MOUTH.

25:20.249 --> 25:22.892
YEAH. TELL ME ABOUT IT.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.196
(sighs)

25:27.196 --> 25:28.698
DR. TORRES.

25:28.698 --> 25:31.260
UM, DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
ABOUT ROBBINS' FITTING?

25:31.260 --> 25:32.932
I MEAN, UH, MOORE SAID--

25:32.932 --> 25:34.263
YOU SPOKE TO MOORE?

25:34.263 --> 25:36.265
I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THAT.
IF SHE'D SEEN YOU--

25:36.265 --> 25:38.267
LOOK, I'M THE ONE
WHO CUT OFF HER LEG.

25:38.267 --> 25:39.869
IF SHE HAS A PROBLEM
ADJUSTING TO THE PROSTHETIC

25:39.869 --> 25:41.210
OR IF TURNS OUT SHE'S GOTTA
HAVE MORE SURGERY...

25:41.210 --> 25:43.142
(elevator bell dings)
I MEAN,
WHAT IF I SCREWED IT UP?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.273
SHE EVEN BLAMES ME
FOR BEING ON THE PLANE.

25:44.273 --> 25:45.975
SHE DOESN'T BLAME YOU, KAREV.

25:45.975 --> 25:47.316
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU MADE THE CUT.

25:47.316 --> 25:49.619
I MADE THE CALL, OKAY?
I WAS SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER.

25:49.619 --> 25:51.080
I'M THE BAD DOCTOR,
THE BAD PERSON.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.722
YOUR NAME NEVER COMES UP.

25:57.757 --> 25:58.928
(squeaks)

25:58.928 --> 26:00.259
NOW IF THIS
DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,

26:00.259 --> 26:01.230
I CAN ADJUST IT

26:01.230 --> 26:02.862
OR--OR WE CAN TRY
A WHOLE NEW CAST.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.033
IT'S FINE.

26:04.033 --> 26:06.596
DON'T RUSH THIS.

26:06.596 --> 26:08.137
IF IT'S NOT RIGHT,
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SUFFERS,

26:08.137 --> 26:09.298
NOT ME.

26:09.298 --> 26:10.269
(tool thuds)

26:10.269 --> 26:12.141
OKAY, LET'S GET YOU UP
ON YOUR FEET.

26:12.141 --> 26:13.272
NO, THAT'S FINE.
I DON'T NEED TO--

26:13.272 --> 26:15.174
I NEED TO SEE YOU TAKE
A FEW STEPS.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.706
LET'S SEE HOW IT FEELS
WHEN YOU PUT SOME WEIGHT ON IT,

26:16.706 --> 26:17.907
ALL RIGHT?

26:17.907 --> 26:20.209
NO. HEY, LET GO!

26:22.181 --> 26:24.814
ARIZONA, YOU--YOU CAN'T
DO THIS ON YOUR OWN.

26:24.814 --> 26:26.215
YOU NEED HELP.

26:26.215 --> 26:27.356
IF WE DO THIS RIGHT AND WE--

26:27.356 --> 26:29.058
AND WE GET YOU
ON A PROSTHETIC THAT FITS,

26:29.058 --> 26:30.219
YOU'LL NEED LESS,

26:30.219 --> 26:31.721
BUT YOU ARE NOT THERE YET.

26:31.721 --> 26:33.292
AND, YOU KNOW,

26:33.292 --> 26:35.725
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE PEOPLE
IN YOUR CORNER THAT CARE.

26:35.725 --> 26:37.667
YOU SHOULD LET THEM HELP.

26:37.667 --> 26:40.069
YOU'RE LIKE A GIFT FROM GOD.

26:40.069 --> 26:42.902
I-I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.
I BARELY KNOW YOU.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.904
I'M HERE BECAUSE THIS--
THIS IS MY JOB.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.677
I HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS
I COULD BE DOING RIGHT NOW.

26:47.677 --> 26:50.309
YEAH? WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
GO DO THEM?

26:50.309 --> 26:52.141
YOU KNOW,
I THINK I WILL.

26:52.141 --> 26:54.644
(stool wheels clatter)

26:56.315 --> 26:58.918
(door opens)

27:02.852 --> 27:05.855
OKAY, FOLKS.
LET'S GET STARTED.

27:05.855 --> 27:08.057
UM... (clears throat)
DR. SHEPHERD.

27:08.057 --> 27:09.258
YEAH.

27:09.258 --> 27:11.260
WE WERE WONDERING IF,
INSTEAD OF A LECTURE,

27:11.260 --> 27:13.833
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WATCH
DR. GREY REMOVE THAT RARE TUMOR.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.935
DR. GREY IS NOT REMOVING
A RARE TUMOR.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.837
YEAH, SHE IS.
NO, SHE'S NOT.

27:17.837 --> 27:20.770
BUT SHE AND DR. BROOKS
ARE IN O.R. ONE RIGHT NOW.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.052
(exhales)
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

27:33.052 --> 27:34.353
WHO?

27:34.353 --> 27:35.785
THOMAS.

27:35.785 --> 27:37.286
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, LEGALLY,

27:37.286 --> 27:39.258
I COULD GET
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE

27:39.258 --> 27:40.259
FOR TELLING YOU ABOUT THE--

27:40.259 --> 27:41.791
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
IT WAS HIS IDEA.

27:41.791 --> 27:43.062
REALLY?

27:43.062 --> 27:44.734
HE JUST SUDDENLY CHANGES
HIS MIND

27:44.734 --> 27:47.266
AND GOES WITH AN APPROACH
HE REJECTED TWO DAYS AGO?

27:47.266 --> 27:48.898
I KNOW. I WAS SURPRISED, TOO.

27:48.898 --> 27:51.070
I WAS, LIKE, "WHOA,
WHAT A SURPRISE."

27:52.241 --> 27:53.402
(soap thuds)

27:53.402 --> 27:54.774
(turns on water)

27:54.774 --> 27:55.975
OKAY.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.206
(water running)

27:57.206 --> 27:59.308
NO, ACTUALLY,
MAYBE WE LUCKED OUT.

27:59.308 --> 28:01.380
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
USE ONE OF THOSE.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.351
I WOULDN'T EVEN ALLOW IT

28:02.351 --> 28:03.883
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE IN THERE

28:03.883 --> 28:06.215
TO TAKE OVER
WHEN HE CRAPS OUT.

28:06.215 --> 28:07.286
(pager chimes)

28:07.286 --> 28:09.688
WHEN HE DOES, IT MIGHT JUST
BE ALL THE BOARD NEEDS

28:09.688 --> 28:13.092
TO PROCEED WITH HIS DISMISSAL.

28:15.064 --> 28:16.265
Dr. Yang.

28:24.974 --> 28:26.305
SUCTION.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.037
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE JUST SUCH A BADASS.

28:28.037 --> 28:29.879
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN BRAGGING,

28:29.879 --> 28:31.781
BUT I-I LIKED
FEELING LIKE ONE, TOO.

28:31.781 --> 28:32.942
IF I WAS A REAL BADASS,

28:32.942 --> 28:34.113
I WOULD'VE
JUST KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT,

28:34.113 --> 28:35.344
BEEN STOIC, SILENT.

28:35.344 --> 28:36.986
YEAH.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THAT?

28:36.986 --> 28:39.118
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:42.191 --> 28:43.953
(Meredith) MORE SUCTION,
PLEASE.

28:43.953 --> 28:45.795
MM.

28:45.795 --> 28:47.196
(sighs) HEY.

28:47.196 --> 28:49.799
I CAN'T GET
GOOD VISUALIZATION.

28:49.799 --> 28:51.160
THAT'S A BIG TUMOR.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.132
YEAH, IT IS.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.164
SHE DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME
ABOUT IT.

28:55.164 --> 28:57.036
I FOUND OUT
THROUGH ONE OF MY INTERNS.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.107
HUH.

28:58.107 --> 29:00.139
MY WIFE
IS BUBBLE WRAPPING ME.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.071
(exhales)

29:02.071 --> 29:04.173
SHEPHERD,
YOU HAVE A REPUTATION

29:04.173 --> 29:06.315
FOR NEEDING
TO BE BUBBLE WRAPPED.

29:06.315 --> 29:08.417
EXCUSE ME?

29:08.417 --> 29:12.151
YOU FIGHT FOR YOUR PATIENTS
AGAINST THE WORST POSSIBLE ODDS,

29:12.151 --> 29:13.823
BUT WHEN THINGS
GET MESSY PERSONALLY,

29:13.823 --> 29:15.224
YOU'RE GONE...

29:15.224 --> 29:18.327
OFF TO THE WOODS TO DRINK
AND GROW A BEARD.

29:18.327 --> 29:19.859
AND WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED

29:19.859 --> 29:21.991
AND THIS LAWSUIT
KEEPING IT ALL ALIVE,

29:21.991 --> 29:23.132
MAYBE SHE JUST...

29:23.132 --> 29:25.194
WORRIED THAT
THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE THING

29:25.194 --> 29:26.996
IS GONNA MAKE YOU RUN OFF
TO THAT TRAILER

29:26.996 --> 29:28.437
AND LEAVE HER ALONE

29:28.437 --> 29:30.139
IN THE HOUSE YOU GAVE HER,

29:30.139 --> 29:33.142
NOT SLEEPING AT NIGHT BECAUSE
WHICHEVER ROOM SHE LAYS DOWN IN,

29:33.142 --> 29:35.144
SHE JUST CAN'T
GET AWAY FROM THE FACT

29:35.144 --> 29:37.206
THAT YOU'RE JUST NOT THERE.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.111
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD THAT
ALL TEED UP AND READY TO GO.

29:42.111 --> 29:43.282
(chuckles)

29:43.282 --> 29:45.184
YEAH. YEAH, WELL,
A VERSION OF IT.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.016
IT'S MEANT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE,
YOU KNOW,

29:47.016 --> 29:49.158
BUT, UH,
IT KIND OF WORKS HERE, TOO.

29:49.158 --> 29:52.091
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S COMING BACK.

29:52.091 --> 29:53.192
NO.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.994
NO, I DON'T.

29:54.994 --> 29:56.195
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:56.195 --> 29:57.796
HERE IT IS.

30:00.469 --> 30:01.901
WHERE DO WE START?

30:01.901 --> 30:05.875
(suction gurgles)

30:05.875 --> 30:07.336
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:07.336 --> 30:10.009
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY
THE TESTICLES AND THE CORDS.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.011
DON'T WANT TO DAMAGE THEM.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.182
(Miranda) YES, MA'AM.

30:13.182 --> 30:14.914
I'LL KEEP MY EYES PEELED.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.486
(chuckles) I'M HAVING
THE BEST TIME.

30:17.486 --> 30:19.188
(Richard) FORCEPS.

30:19.188 --> 30:21.350
WHAT'S WITH THE FACE?
I'M NOT MAKING A FACE.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.392
I'VE SPENT A FEW THOUSAND HOURS
LOOKING AT YOU WITH A MASK ON.

30:23.392 --> 30:24.593
I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE MAKING
A FACE.

30:24.593 --> 30:26.095
BAILEY, I'M NOT MAKING
A FACE.

30:26.095 --> 30:29.228
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I DID NOT BULLY APRIL KEPNER

30:29.228 --> 30:30.199
INTO GIVING UP THIS SURGERY.

30:30.199 --> 30:31.260
SHE APPROACHED ME.

30:31.260 --> 30:33.562
SO... NUTS TO HER.

30:33.562 --> 30:35.034
(laughs) GET IT?

30:35.034 --> 30:38.607
NUTS TO HER? (laughs)

30:38.607 --> 30:40.539
OH, COME ON.
YOU GET IT.

30:40.539 --> 30:44.243
I'M A UROLOGIST, DR. BAILEY.
OF COURSE I GET IT.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.275
HEY, I SPEND MOST OF MY DAY
IN A BOWEL.

30:46.275 --> 30:48.948
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T LAUGH
AT A FART.

30:48.948 --> 30:52.251
(laughs)

30:52.251 --> 30:55.024
OH, TOUGH ROOM.

30:55.024 --> 30:56.585
OH, HEY, AVERY,
KNOCK, KNOCK.

30:56.585 --> 30:58.587
I THINK I JUST LOCATED
THE LEFT TESTICLE.

30:58.587 --> 31:00.289
YES, YOU HAVE.

31:00.289 --> 31:02.992
I WILL CONTINUE TO EXCISE
THE SURROUNDING TISSUE.

31:02.992 --> 31:06.065
IF SOMEONE CAN JUST GET
A HAND UNDERNEATH...

31:06.065 --> 31:08.067
YEAH. OH.
UH, SORRY.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.438
NO, NO, NO. PLEASE.
GO AHEAD.
NO, I INSIST.

31:09.438 --> 31:11.200
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE TESTICLE.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.342
SOMEBODY GET UP IN THERE.

31:13.342 --> 31:14.503
(sighs)

31:14.503 --> 31:16.175
OF ALL THE ORGANS
IN THE BODY,

31:16.175 --> 31:17.947
OF COURSE
IT HAD TO BE THIS ONE.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.449
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

31:20.449 --> 31:21.951
DAMN.

31:21.951 --> 31:23.212
DAMN IT.

31:23.212 --> 31:25.384
YOU KNOW, I'M PRETTY SURE
NO ONE'S EVER CLOSED A P.D.A.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.186
BY SWEARING AT THE CATHETER.

31:27.186 --> 31:29.258
I DON'T NEED
ANY TIPS, THANK YOU.

31:29.258 --> 31:31.260
I'VE USED
A GUIDE WIRE BEFORE.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.221
REALLY?

31:32.221 --> 31:33.923
WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER

31:33.923 --> 31:36.025
YOU LEARNED TO USE SHEEP'S BLOOD
TO LIFT A WITCH'S CURSE?

31:36.025 --> 31:37.296
WOULD YOU BE QUIET?

31:37.296 --> 31:39.898
(beeping continues)

31:39.898 --> 31:41.070
DAMN.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.371
JUST RELAX.

31:42.371 --> 31:44.173
AHH.

31:48.207 --> 31:51.510
I CAN'T PASS THE WIRE.
YOU--YOU BETTER TAKE OVER.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.083
HERE.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.544
YOUR--YOUR RIGHT WRIST.

31:55.544 --> 31:56.915
WHAT ABOUT IT?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.087
JUST TURN IT IN,
LIKE THIS.

31:58.087 --> 31:59.248
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

31:59.248 --> 32:00.389
JUST--JUST TRY IT. TRY IT.

32:00.389 --> 32:02.321
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.625
OH.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.998
THAT'S ALL, HUH?

32:08.998 --> 32:10.299
THAT'S PRETTY NEAT.

32:10.299 --> 32:12.131
IF YOU'D LIKE, I CAN
ADVANCE THE BALLOON FOR YOU--

32:12.131 --> 32:14.133
BACK OFF, SISTER.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.565
EYES ON YOUR OWN WORK.
(chuckles)

32:16.565 --> 32:19.408
(hums)

32:19.408 --> 32:21.310
(indistinct conversations)

32:35.224 --> 32:37.286
(exhales)

32:50.969 --> 32:52.241
OH.
