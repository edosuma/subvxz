00:30.875 --> 00:32.791
[Valeska] I thought
you called it.

00:32.875 --> 00:35.583
[Telly] I thought
Perez called it.

00:35.666 --> 00:38.166
[Santiago] Why the fuck
would I wanna see
any of you?

00:39.083 --> 00:40.291
Especially tonight.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.916
You hear anything, Valeska?

00:44.708 --> 00:46.958
I've heard plenty.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.250
My guy says he cracked
the Joker's head in two.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.750
One swing,
and the man's brains
spilled out like wedding soup.

00:52.833 --> 00:54.583
It wasn't him.

00:54.666 --> 00:57.291
We all know
the Bat doesn't do murder.

00:59.250 --> 01:00.416
He does now.

01:04.458 --> 01:09.541
Well, let's do this again
when one of you dies.

01:09.625 --> 01:10.666
[knocks on table]

01:12.625 --> 01:13.666
[guns cocking]

01:13.750 --> 01:14.791
What the fuck?

01:16.666 --> 01:17.625
[man] Open it.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.125
Jimmy.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.333
Like I said,
until the next time.

01:44.416 --> 01:45.916
[man] Open the bag!

01:49.833 --> 01:51.666
[gunshot]

01:51.750 --> 01:53.708
Shit, where the fuck
is this guy?

01:57.625 --> 01:58.833
[projectile fires]

01:58.916 --> 01:59.958
[grunts, screams]

02:26.666 --> 02:27.666
The bag.

02:43.708 --> 02:44.750
[man 2] Oh, shit.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.250
Fuck me.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.916
That's Danny.
That's my sister's kid!

02:52.000 --> 02:53.708
All your number-twos
are in there.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.625
Who the fuck are you?

02:58.708 --> 03:01.041
I'm the guy you want
on your side.

03:01.125 --> 03:02.416
I can protect you.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.083
-From the Bat?
-Batman's gone. I retired him.

03:06.166 --> 03:10.583
Check the sky every night.
No more Bat Signals.
The nightmare's over.

03:10.666 --> 03:13.166
Any problems with cops
or other masks,

03:13.250 --> 03:15.416
I take care of it
from now on.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.958
It'll cost you 40%
of what you make.

03:18.041 --> 03:19.833
And trust me,

03:19.916 --> 03:21.875
you're about to make
a lot more.

03:23.708 --> 03:24.583
Fuck this...

03:30.125 --> 03:31.166
[thudding]

03:43.958 --> 03:45.166
Any more questions?

03:46.666 --> 03:48.750
[theme music playing]

04:25.458 --> 04:28.375
They said you were undercover
before this.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah.

04:32.416 --> 04:33.416
Vice?

04:35.041 --> 04:35.916
Gangs?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.500
Narcotics?

04:38.583 --> 04:40.791
-A little bit of everything.
-Wow.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.250
How long you been
on the force?

04:42.333 --> 04:45.875
You ask a lot of questions,
Tod-with-one-D.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.875
No, I...
It's just funny, you know.

04:48.958 --> 04:56.583
You show up a few months ago,
nobody knows from where,
people are whispering... IA?

04:56.666 --> 04:58.208
I'm not IA.

04:58.291 --> 05:01.791
I was with a special branch
of law enforcement before this.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.041
Like Secret Service?

05:05.666 --> 05:07.583
I was a bird, Tod.

05:07.666 --> 05:13.583
A big, red bird
with latex talons and
a composite beak-like helmet.

05:13.666 --> 05:18.208
Okay, Mr. Mystery.
[clicks tongue]
Have it your way.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.250
[policeman on radio]
<i>20th & Grand. Shots fired.</i>

05:20.333 --> 05:22.291
-I'll take the tunnel.
-Yeah, I'll take 20th.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.375
[bicycle bell ringing]

05:26.458 --> 05:27.583
[Hank] Stop running!

05:29.166 --> 05:30.125
[grunting]

05:32.541 --> 05:35.000
-[Hank] That was fast.
-[Dove] Yeah.

05:35.083 --> 05:36.250
[man grunts]

05:36.333 --> 05:38.291
Practically delivered himself
to me.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.708
[Hank] Wanna grab a coffee?

05:41.291 --> 05:43.250
I... I have a lunch.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.333
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Boat salesman.

05:47.000 --> 05:47.875
The broker.

05:49.875 --> 05:52.583
Um, I'll be around
if you need me.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.166
We still got it.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.333
[Dove] Always will.

06:02.583 --> 06:05.166

I'm Dick Grayson.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.541
Yeah, I know.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.708
You picked a nice time

06:51.791 --> 06:52.791
And you are?

06:53.916 --> 06:55.000
[Gordon] Thanks, Vee.

07:04.916 --> 07:09.541
11:20 last night,
Bruce's jet took off.
Changed IFR in mid-air.

07:09.625 --> 07:11.000
Nobody knows
where he touched down.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.791
-Except maybe you?
-[scoffs] I wish I did.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.000
-What happened?
-I was asleep.

07:16.083 --> 07:19.166
Bruce came into my room
and dropped a bloody crowbar
on the floor.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.625
Said it was over
with him and the Joker.
That he ended it.

07:21.708 --> 07:25.833
Then he said
he was done with Gotham,
the Bat, all of it.

07:25.916 --> 07:28.833
So that's it? No note?
Marching orders?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.666
He said be a better Batman.

07:30.750 --> 07:33.875

fucked-up parent jiu-jitsu.

07:45.791 --> 07:46.958
You're not serious.

07:48.541 --> 07:50.416
I can't leave now, can I?

07:50.500 --> 07:52.500
You know
how crazy that is, right?

07:52.583 --> 07:54.250
Trying to step into
your father's shoes?

07:54.333 --> 07:55.708
I do, Commissioner Gordon.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.958
"Be a better Batman," huh?

08:05.750 --> 08:09.250
[Dick] Bruce wasn't perfect,
okay? He got sloppy.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.041
Let it get personal
with the Joker.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.041
What happens when Gotham
takes one of yours, Dick?

08:13.125 --> 08:15.250
I'm not gonna go around Gotham
swinging a fucking crowbar,
am I?

08:16.833 --> 08:18.041
I'm sorry.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.583
We'll see.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.041
Any other headlines?

08:26.125 --> 08:27.416
I'm bringing in the Titans.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.583
Are you sure about that?

08:32.166 --> 08:33.666
[male reporter]

08:49.666 --> 08:52.250
[Dick] Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.041
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.916
[Kory scoffs] Nobody calls us
under better circumstances.

08:59.291 --> 09:05.625
I appreciate you for coming,
but I should warn you,
you're not in San Francisco.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.833
This city breeds
a special class of criminal.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.291
People die here.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.791
Not just regular people.
People like us.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.458
I don't wanna lose
anybody else.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.916
We know
what we're up against.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.708
You're family.
We'd never let you
do this alone.

09:24.291 --> 09:25.416
Can we see the Batsuit?

09:26.708 --> 09:27.500
No.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.625
The Batmobile?

09:28.708 --> 09:30.625
-Guys!
-What? He made me ask.

09:30.708 --> 09:33.166
I did not. Dick!

09:33.250 --> 09:34.833
There'll be enough time
for all of that,

09:34.916 --> 09:36.958
but right now
we need to focus
on the task at hand.

09:37.041 --> 09:41.000
Word's out in Gotham
that Batman's gone.
News like that travels fast.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.708
So we'll have our hands full.

09:42.791 --> 09:46.958
Get some food.
Get some rest.
Could be a long night.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.291

Yeah, go ahead.

09:59.375 --> 10:02.750
Her name's Ann Williams.
She's a 34-year-old
marketing consultant.

10:02.833 --> 10:06.750
No record,
no religious groups,
no terrorist affiliations.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.500

10:08.583 --> 10:10.041
She's a widow.
She has a 7-year-old daughter.

10:10.125 --> 10:12.166
-Where's she?
-We're looking.

10:13.791 --> 10:15.666
She ask for a lawyer?

10:15.750 --> 10:18.541
She hasn't said a word
since we brought her in.
She just brought this note.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.291
Asking to talk to Nightwing.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.833
Looks like it was written
on the back of a textbook page
or something.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.625
Play it.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.041
She's terrified.

10:51.875 --> 10:52.750
Red hood.

10:54.333 --> 10:57.125
Joker started out his career
wearing one.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.333
Think it might be related?

11:00.041 --> 11:01.083
I hope not.

11:14.416 --> 11:15.375

in green pastures.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.041
[whimpers]

11:43.250 --> 11:44.958
-You asked to speak to me?
-[gasps]

11:56.291 --> 11:58.541
-Can you speak?
-Mmm-mmm.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.375
The red hood
you were wearing...

12:02.458 --> 12:04.083
Was that something to do
with the Joker?

12:08.875 --> 12:10.416
Why do you wanna
talk to me?

12:19.375 --> 12:20.458
Who did that to you?

12:22.833 --> 12:24.291
Am I supposed to call that?

12:28.458 --> 12:29.625
7-3-5...

12:31.250 --> 12:32.375

12:47.166 --> 12:48.291
-Hey.

13:05.375 --> 13:06.375
[gasps]

13:39.041 --> 13:42.750
We found Ann's daughter
wandering around
the bus station an hour ago.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.041
Also wearing a red hood.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.416
She said
some strange man in a mask
snatched her out of bed.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.333
So Ann wasn't working alone.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.250
Or he used the kid
to coerce her.

13:56.250 --> 13:59.041
No money,
no political manifestos.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.208
Doesn't sound like
a Joker copycat to me.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.291
So what does he want?

14:04.291 --> 14:05.875
What's any terrorist want?

14:05.958 --> 14:10.916
Create chaos, paranoia, fear.
The noisy kind.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.625
Toxicology came back.

14:12.708 --> 14:15.416
The woman had a subdermal
drug delivery system
in her arm.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.666
Our guy said it was
some sort of Flakka derivation.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.958
Like nuclear bath salts.

14:21.041 --> 14:24.625
He juiced her with
some serious chemical strength.

14:24.708 --> 14:29.458
A bomb and pharmacology.
Points to a science background,
maybe military.

14:29.541 --> 14:31.625
Well, that narrows it down
a few hundred thousand.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.583
Probably with
a mental health issue, too.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.250
Might help narrow the profile.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.208
I wasn't gonna mention this,

14:42.291 --> 14:45.833
but for cases like these,
we've been using a consultant,
a profiler.

14:45.916 --> 14:49.125
And we've gotten good results,
but you're not gonna like it.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.458
Okay.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.208
You're really
not gonna like it.

14:55.958 --> 14:57.291
Scarecrow.

14:57.375 --> 14:58.333
What?

14:58.416 --> 14:59.458
Told you
you wouldn't like it.

15:01.208 --> 15:05.333
You know,
Batman put him in Arkham
years ago for a reason.

15:05.416 --> 15:06.541
Oh, he's still there.

15:06.625 --> 15:08.458
He's just helping us out
on the side.

15:08.541 --> 15:12.000
This is nuts.
You're taking advice
from a fucking crazy person.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.416
It was Bruce's idea.

15:18.291 --> 15:19.916
He thought that
Crane had value.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.791
And so far,
he's been right.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.833
When it comes to profiling
the criminally insane,

15:24.916 --> 15:28.541
I hate to admit it,
but he's the best
that we've got.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.791
And after
what happened today,

15:30.875 --> 15:32.166
I think that
we need the best.

15:37.541 --> 15:39.208
[sighs]

15:39.291 --> 15:41.625
I'll call ahead,
make an introduction.

16:46.125 --> 16:49.958

16:50.041 --> 16:52.375

nor love, nor loneliness,

16:52.458 --> 16:54.750
will ever give comfort
to fear."

16:57.541 --> 16:59.666
Welcome to
Camp Cruel and Unusual.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.500
[gasping]

17:18.625 --> 17:24.958
This is insane.
Batman's actual books!
[chuckles]

17:25.041 --> 17:29.416
<i>The Red Book</i> by Carl Jung.
Original 1959
estate manuscript.

17:29.500 --> 17:33.541
<i>Meditations of the Emperor</i>
<i>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.</i>

17:34.791 --> 17:36.625
-What are you doing?
-What?

17:36.708 --> 17:38.541
Don't put food
on his books, man.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.041
Were you raised in a barn?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.125
Mmm. Test tube, actually.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.958
Hey, does Superman
have a library?

17:46.750 --> 17:48.375
Mmm, I don't know.

17:48.458 --> 17:52.291
I feel like he's got
a whole bunch of
space rocks and shit.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.666
[Kory speaking Tamaranian]

17:55.791 --> 17:58.041
Oh, hey Kory, you gotta
check this out. It's...

17:58.125 --> 17:59.250
[continues speaking Tamaranian]

18:07.333 --> 18:08.791
Uh, Kory?

18:08.875 --> 18:10.000
[continues speaking Tamaranian]

18:18.166 --> 18:19.291
[continues speaking Tamaranian]

18:24.958 --> 18:26.000
Kory, talk to me.

18:32.583 --> 18:33.625
[gasps]

18:44.916 --> 18:46.833
Please tell me
that was a grease fire.

18:47.958 --> 18:49.000
[panting]

18:53.250 --> 18:54.291
[cell phone ringing]

19:00.583 --> 19:03.666
The famous Starfire
finally returns a call.

19:03.750 --> 19:08.208
-[Kory on phone]
<i>Sorry, Justin. I've been a rat.</i>
-That's okay.

19:08.291 --> 19:11.125
Been busy
saving San Francisco,
now Gotham.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.125
-What's going on?
<i>-Um...</i>

19:14.208 --> 19:16.458
We had a death
in the family.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19:18.083 --> 19:21.416
Jesus. Is there anything
I can do?

19:21.500 --> 19:22.666
Actually, there is.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.708
I had a couple of
strange episodes.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.083
I didn't know
who else to call.

19:30.166 --> 19:32.125
I don't know
what to make of them.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.708
<i>Well, grief can do that.</i>

19:35.958 --> 19:37.083
Yeah?

19:37.166 --> 19:39.416
<i>Crying, laughing, drinking.</i>

19:40.250 --> 19:41.583
Sleeping with strangers.

19:41.666 --> 19:44.291
<i>I wish it was that kind.</i>
<i>It's not.</i>

19:44.375 --> 19:47.125
This is more of a...

19:47.208 --> 19:51.625
"Blacking out in the middle of
the day and torching the walls"
kind of episode.

19:53.416 --> 19:55.458
Ah. That kind.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.791
<i>You've heard of that?</i>

19:58.875 --> 20:02.791
What you described sounds like
a violent parasomnia episode.

20:02.875 --> 20:04.750
That's usually when
our subconscious is knocking,

20:04.833 --> 20:07.875
saying, "Yo, something's
not right down here."

20:07.958 --> 20:09.750
So, I'm nuts.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.250
Yup. Like the rest of us.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.583
If it happens again, call me.
Maybe I can
prescribe something.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.083
Thanks.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.250
And if it doesn't happen again,
you can call me anyway.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.208
I will.

20:54.458 --> 20:55.541
What cell?

20:55.625 --> 20:57.708
He's on the end.
Only one down here.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.541
Dr. Crane?

21:20.416 --> 21:21.458
[duct tape ripping]

21:26.291 --> 21:27.333
[Crane] Weed?

21:29.666 --> 21:32.375
Look, if you want my help,
and you do,

21:32.458 --> 21:34.708
then I'm gonna need
some high-quality flower.

21:34.791 --> 21:38.875
I'm talking 70-30 sativa.
Lemon Lyric is my favorite,
but I'm not a name-brand whore.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.708
Just get me in the ballpark.

21:40.791 --> 21:44.416
Anything above 25% THC,
we can have
our little tete-a-tete.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.500
[soft thudding]

21:48.875 --> 21:50.458
[Dick] You're doing
the stoner act, huh?

21:55.625 --> 21:58.291
It's not an act.
It helps my brain slow down.

22:00.333 --> 22:03.958
Arkham isn't really
a venue for depressants.

22:04.041 --> 22:06.208
Gotham PD actually has you
on the payroll?

22:09.083 --> 22:11.541
[exhales] No.

22:11.625 --> 22:15.208
But when I am
a good little doggie,
they give me my treats.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.250
A woman killed herself
today, Doctor.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.458
Very strange case.

22:18.541 --> 22:19.583
[chuckles]

22:20.166 --> 22:21.583
I heard.

22:21.666 --> 22:24.375
She asked for
a new guy, Nightwing.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.416
Poor Batman.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.541
I mean, the dude has
one little murdering spree

22:28.625 --> 22:31.125
and all of a sudden
he's yesterday's news, right?

22:31.208 --> 22:32.625
[chuckles]

22:32.708 --> 22:34.000
You got rolling papers?

22:38.666 --> 22:41.791
Ah. Love you, brother.
Love ya.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.083
[Crane exhales]

22:44.166 --> 22:46.125
Somebody installed
a subdermal drug pump
in her arm.

22:46.208 --> 22:48.083
Yeah, Barb sent over
a cheat sheet.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.916
He's a vicious little fucker,
this one.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Although,
if we're being honest,

22:52.083 --> 22:54.708
I mean, a subcutaneous
drug pump? [chuckles]
That's too clever by half.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.708
Gotta give him an A+
for originality, though.

22:56.791 --> 22:59.958
The victim was a mother.
Afraid of losing her child.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.291
So afraid, in fact,
she murdered four strangers.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.875
Wait, wait, wait.
You know, when Barb...

23:03.958 --> 23:05.541
When she said
your name, it, uh...

23:05.625 --> 23:07.375
it rung a little bell
in my head.

23:07.458 --> 23:11.458
The carney kid that
Bruce Wayne took in for PR?

23:12.250 --> 23:13.541
You're that Dick Grayson?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.625
You know who I am.

23:16.708 --> 23:18.791
And your story's
biblical, brother.

23:18.875 --> 23:24.416
I mean, really, you ditched
the family safety net,
you flee swinging Wayne Manor.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.416
And then, years later,

23:27.708 --> 23:29.958
like the motherfucking
prodigal son,

23:30.041 --> 23:33.125
home again, home again,
jiggety jig.

23:33.208 --> 23:35.375
I didn't come here
to talk about myself.

23:35.458 --> 23:38.083
If you've read the file,
maybe you have a few ideas?

23:38.166 --> 23:40.791
Well, do you have a light?

23:41.708 --> 23:42.708
No, sorry.

23:45.708 --> 23:48.708
That's okay.
I got connections.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.625
Yes. The file.

23:51.541 --> 23:54.041
Now... [clears throat] Um...

23:56.041 --> 23:59.500
My best guess,
and it's just a guess,
is that, uh,

23:59.583 --> 24:01.666
he somehow knows who this
Nightwing character really is

24:01.750 --> 24:04.333
and he has some sort of
jealousy complex.

24:06.625 --> 24:08.416
-That's it?
-That's it.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.041
Maybe he has a background
in explosives,
military, construction.

24:12.125 --> 24:14.125
Maybe just an Internet moog.

24:14.208 --> 24:18.000
Okay, it's nice to see
that higher learning
wasn't wasted on you, Doctor.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.125
Thanks for your help.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.250
It's the Bird's Opening.

24:24.791 --> 24:26.125
What?

24:26.208 --> 24:28.291
It's the Bird's Opening.

24:28.375 --> 24:31.541
It's one of the oldest known
openings in chess.

24:31.625 --> 24:35.125
It was made famous in 1855
by Henry Edward Bird.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.250
It's a classic
king-pawn opening.

24:40.541 --> 24:44.208
The two are connected,
relying on each other.

24:44.291 --> 24:47.750
The King moves stealthily
in the shadows,

24:47.833 --> 24:52.041
while the pawns are sent
into the teeth of destruction
so that he may advance.

24:52.125 --> 24:56.250
-You got all that
from the police cheat sheet?
-Yeah.

24:56.333 --> 25:01.458
The note, it's written
on the back of a page
torn from a chess manual.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.916
It's just his opening move.

25:06.541 --> 25:10.125
[Dick] f4 d5, Knight f3 g6,

25:10.208 --> 25:13.541
e3 Bishop g7,
Bishop e2,

25:13.625 --> 25:16.458
Knight f6, castles, castles.

25:16.541 --> 25:18.250
Is it some kind of code?

25:18.333 --> 25:20.250
That's the Bird's Opening,
chess moves.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.458
I've been running
the piece and board numbers
through the computer.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.083
-Looking at
all the combinations.
-For what?

25:25.166 --> 25:28.458
A telephone number,
bank accounts...
[breathes deeply]

25:29.583 --> 25:30.875
Needle in a haystack.

25:36.291 --> 25:37.291
[beeping]

25:38.416 --> 25:39.500
"Robin."

25:39.583 --> 25:41.125
The Bird's Opening, Robin.

25:42.250 --> 25:43.416
That can't be random.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.166
Ann lived at
2289 Blue Bird Way.

25:47.791 --> 25:48.875
[keyboard clacking]

25:53.375 --> 25:55.833
Let's get a list
of all the Gotham streets
with bird names.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.250
There's five in Gotham.

26:00.333 --> 26:04.500
Blue Bird, Condor Court,
Finch Street, Falcon Way
and Eagle Crest.

26:04.583 --> 26:06.458
I'll see
if the numbers correlate
to the actual addresses

26:06.541 --> 26:09.083
-and the addresses
of the next victims.
-[whooshing]

26:10.500 --> 26:12.000
I pedaled
as fast as I could.

26:12.083 --> 26:14.958
-[laughs] Hank!
-How are you doing, Kory?

26:15.041 --> 26:16.541
-Hi. Oh!
-Good to see you.

26:16.625 --> 26:18.916
-About time.
-Hey, buddy.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.208
So, are we suiting up?

26:22.208 --> 26:23.250
[laughing]

26:25.916 --> 26:28.083
What the fuck?
You just show up.

26:28.166 --> 26:30.000
-No phone call.
-Phone call?

26:30.083 --> 26:33.000
You left me a message
saying you were
going out of town.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.541
Then I see the news.

26:34.625 --> 26:36.708
-You weren't gonna tell me
you were here?
-[scoffs]

26:36.791 --> 26:38.458
I don't have to tell you
my every move.

26:38.541 --> 26:40.958
Oh, I guess I'm a little fuzzy
on the rules.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.000
The rules are
you do your thing,
I do mine.

26:43.083 --> 26:46.041
Okay. Well, this is
kind of my thing, too.

26:46.125 --> 26:47.500
[scoffs]

26:47.583 --> 26:50.666
Look, when Donna died,
I let you follow me to D.C.

26:50.750 --> 26:53.833
because we both
had roots there.
It made sense.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.458
It still does.

26:55.541 --> 26:58.000
Except, I still wanna suit up,
answer the call, you don't!

26:58.083 --> 26:59.791
It's not that simple.

26:59.875 --> 27:03.291
Putting on the Hawk suit
and not being together
kind of sucked.

27:09.541 --> 27:11.666
Are you planning on
going back to D.C.?

27:15.583 --> 27:16.625
I don't know.

27:17.458 --> 27:18.291
[exhales]

27:19.500 --> 27:21.333
That doesn't look like
an overnight bag.

27:26.875 --> 27:28.083
This is Gotham.

27:29.458 --> 27:32.375
If you're gonna Dove,
I'm gonna Hawk.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.125
[groans softly]

27:39.166 --> 27:42.583
Let's go.
We have work to do.

27:42.666 --> 27:44.083
Next time send a text.

27:51.666 --> 27:53.791
[sirens wailing in distance]

27:57.166 --> 27:59.083
Nobody in the back.

27:59.166 --> 28:02.583
Hey. We cleared Finch Street.
Any luck on Eagle Crest?

28:02.666 --> 28:06.875
Nothing. Conner called,
he and Gar came up empty.

28:06.958 --> 28:08.583
-We're too late.
-[line beeping]

28:09.125 --> 28:09.958
Hold on.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.791
Talk to me.

28:12.875 --> 28:15.291
<i>Dick. It's Barb.</i>
<i>We've got a problem.</i>
<i>Bank robbery in progress.</i>

28:15.375 --> 28:18.833
<i>Four armed men and hostages,</i>
<i>we don't know how many.</i>

28:18.916 --> 28:21.916
<i>I wasn't gonna call you,</i>
<i>but they're all wearing</i>
<i>red hoods.</i>

28:23.500 --> 28:24.541
Let's go.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.916
[sirens wailing]

28:31.166 --> 28:32.291
[policeman shouts indistinctly]

28:41.166 --> 28:42.916
Hey.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.416
They have hostages,
but they won't talk to us.
Issued no demands.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.833
It's not a bank robbery.
Tell your men to pull back.

28:48.916 --> 28:50.166
Pull back?

28:50.250 --> 28:52.250
It's a setup,
just like with Ann Williams.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.541
They've been forced into this.
I think it's the same person
behind it.

28:55.625 --> 28:58.625
So what? We just pull back,
wait for the mayhem to start?

28:58.708 --> 29:00.791
No, I can go in there
and talk to them.

29:00.875 --> 29:02.458
They're not criminals,
they're parents.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.541
They think their children
are in danger.

29:04.625 --> 29:06.875
Gar and Conner are searching
for the kids right now.

29:06.958 --> 29:10.125
That's the leverage.
We find them,
this all goes away.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.000
Call your men off
and let us handle it.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.708
If you're wrong,
this is gonna be a bloodbath.

29:18.916 --> 29:19.958
We got this.

29:29.083 --> 29:30.833
Stand down!

29:30.916 --> 29:32.000
[policemen clamoring]

29:38.625 --> 29:41.375
[Nightwing] All right.
Each of us has
a gunman to contain.

29:41.458 --> 29:43.333
But remember,
they're not professionals.

29:43.416 --> 29:45.458
They're scared,
may be on drugs,

29:45.541 --> 29:47.541
so don't be surprised
if they're irrational.

29:47.625 --> 29:50.791
No sudden moves.
No loud voices.
The calmer the better.

29:55.416 --> 29:57.041
[woman whimpers] Please...

29:57.125 --> 29:59.583
[gunman 1] Come on, come on.
Give me the bag.

30:01.291 --> 30:02.833
Please don't...

30:07.000 --> 30:08.416
[gunman 2] It's time.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.583
Do it. He has my son.

30:12.666 --> 30:14.000
He has our kids.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.250
[Nightwing] Wait.

30:22.375 --> 30:23.666
Stay back!

30:23.750 --> 30:26.416
Easy. Everyone, just relax.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.250
