<i>You're watching</i>
The Last Man On Earth.

00:02.837 --> 00:06.138
We were known as KWA,
Knitters with Attitude.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.308
<i>Catch all-new episodes Sunday.</i>
<i>And check out</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:12.478

00:12.480 --> 00:14.513
I'm a grand--
I'm a grandfather?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.485 --> 00:20.019
<i>Previously on</i>
The Last Man on Earth...

00:20.021 --> 00:21.320
Let's have Todd put
my baby in you.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.122
No friggin' way.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.025
Mike Shelby Miller,
will you be our sperm?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.393
I-I'd be honored.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.228
Friggin' ridiculous.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.696
(laughs) I'm pregnant!

00:30.698 --> 00:31.997
(squeals, laughs)

00:31.999 --> 00:33.098
Oh!

00:35.068 --> 00:36.602
(buzzing quietly)

00:40.407 --> 00:42.474
I still can't believe
I'm not sterile.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.575
(both chuckle)

00:43.577 --> 00:46.712
You didn't masturbate
too much, after all.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.147
Yeah, it was just
the right amount.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.248
Thank you.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.251
I am so proud
of your sperm.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.585
I am, too.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.587
Guys, guys.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.190
Gail, Carol is pregnant.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.691
Yeah? Okay, good.
Whatever. Good for you.

00:59.693 --> 01:01.660
You're not gonna
believe the crazy thing

01:01.662 --> 01:03.762
I just saw out there.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.531
It was a flying record player!

01:05.533 --> 01:08.100
It just came out of the sky,
came right at me!

01:08.102 --> 01:09.701
It was like... (yells)

01:09.703 --> 01:11.904
Like when you go to, um,

01:11.906 --> 01:13.872
you know, Waffle House.
It was like...

01:13.874 --> 01:15.707
it was flying skillets.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.242
It was, uh, no.
It was like...

01:17.244 --> 01:20.212
two hovering griddles.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.848
Gail, honey, how much have
you had to drink today?

01:22.850 --> 01:24.716
A lady never tells.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.851
Gail, I think
everybody's just saying

01:25.853 --> 01:27.386
that sometimes
you drink a little bit.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.054
A lot a bit.

01:29.056 --> 01:31.190
Well, maybe you're just a little
confused about what you saw.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.858
I know exactly
what I saw out there!

01:32.860 --> 01:35.928
It was a whole mess
of-of floating hair dryers,

01:35.930 --> 01:37.996
and they were
staring right at me!

01:39.933 --> 01:42.868
(slurring): Do y'all really
think I "mrink" too much?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.236
Well, I think
you might have answered

01:44.238 --> 01:45.471
your own question there.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.212
Oh, farts.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.093
TANDY:
Mmm.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.561
(laughs)

02:09.563 --> 02:12.231
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.233
Mmm.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.469
TODD: What the hell's
going on in here?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.441
Nothing.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.510
Really?

02:26.746 --> 02:30.482
'Cause it doesn't
smell like nothing.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.519
Mike farted.

02:33.521 --> 02:34.653
Yeah.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.021
Yeah, I-I farted.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.157
(laughs) Oh.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.828
That's funny.

02:42.830 --> 02:48.634
'Cause your farts smell like
freshly cooked bacon.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.303
Thank you.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.338
TANDY:
Todd, we're adults here,

02:53.340 --> 02:56.108
and I'm gonna be
honest with you about this.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.177
Mike and I just
finished off the bacon.

02:59.879 --> 03:03.315
Uh, but I-I did fart.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.684
You guys finished the bacon.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.319
MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.887
That's cool.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.023
Thank you, Todd.

03:12.992 --> 03:15.127
You want, uh,
any cracklins, braheem?

03:15.129 --> 03:19.765
(shouting): No, I don't want
any friggin' cracklins, braheem!

03:21.167 --> 03:25.804
You know, I was wondering
if it ever crossed your mind

03:25.806 --> 03:28.507
to consult with me first.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.043
You know, I'm guessing
it didn't, Tandy.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.312
Did it? (chuckles softly)

03:33.314 --> 03:34.379
Did it?!

03:36.482 --> 03:40.686
I found this bacon.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.255
We ran this
by the group...
Yeah.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.856
...and everyone agreed

03:44.858 --> 03:47.025
that Mike should get
to finish off the bacon,

03:47.027 --> 03:48.660
'cause he hasn't
had any yet.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.095
Everyone?

03:50.097 --> 03:51.897
That's funny,
'cause last time I checked,

03:51.899 --> 03:54.866
I was part and parcel
of "everyone."

03:54.868 --> 03:56.902
We looked for
you everywhere,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.437
and we couldn't
find you, bud.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.006
Well, you didn't
look hard enough, bud.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.782
So where are you from
in Australia?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.684
All over. Yeah.
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.553
I've actually, um,
I've been to Adelaide. Yeah.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.456
Yeah, yeah, I actually spent
a bit of time in Adelaide.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.425
Oh, well, then, yeah, you know.
Wh-What were you doing there?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.027
Okay, um...

04:22.029 --> 04:23.462
(chuckles)

04:23.464 --> 04:28.133
I should say that I<i> did</i>
a bit of time in Adelaide.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.236
I was in jail.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.771
Wow.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.742
I somehow got arrested,
uh, for leaving a bank

04:36.744 --> 04:38.377
with some money
that wasn't mine.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.645
Uh-huh.
And then a man

04:39.647 --> 04:42.214
in a uniform
found a gun on me

04:42.216 --> 04:44.316
that turned out
to be mine.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.551
So you're talking about
armed robbery.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.720
Oh, more like an armed
misunderstanding.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.255
And how did that
go over in court?

04:50.257 --> 04:53.425
Well, as I said, I did a bit
of time in Adelaide. (laughs)

04:53.427 --> 04:54.760
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.
(laughs)

04:54.762 --> 04:56.261
Yeah.
So, well,

04:56.263 --> 04:57.829
then how'd you end up,
you know, here in the States?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.498
Oh, I got a job at
the State Department.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.433
They hired you
with a criminal record?

05:01.435 --> 05:02.801
They didn't hire me.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.770
(American accent):
They hired Amanda Williams

05:04.772 --> 05:06.772
from Cleveland, Ohio.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.273
Majored in
political science

05:08.275 --> 05:10.642
at<i> the</i> Ohio State University.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.077
Go Pi Phi!

05:12.079 --> 05:13.078
Go! Whoo!

05:13.080 --> 05:14.613
That's amaz... you know,

05:14.615 --> 05:17.516
you're like the most
interesting person alive.
Nah.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.017
Yeah, does everybody
else know about this?
Hell no.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.585
What are you talk...
Why not?

05:20.587 --> 05:21.987
They've never asked me.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.922
It's like they just latched
onto the Australia thing

05:23.924 --> 05:25.324
and stopped right there.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.326
(Australian accent): Cheers,
Erica! Dingoes ate my baby!

05:27.328 --> 05:28.360
Didgeridoo!

05:28.362 --> 05:29.761
(normal voice):
What's up, Mike?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.296
Hey, Phil. G'day.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.497
Yep.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.270
Hey, bud.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.172
Thinking about
going out

05:40.174 --> 05:41.940
and burning down
the Santa Monica Pier.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.308
You want to come with?

05:43.310 --> 05:46.044
Yeah, what,
was your bacon brother busy?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.479
(sighs)

05:47.481 --> 05:49.047
Come on, T.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.283
You're my original
bacon brother.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.984
I'm talking OBB.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.854
And you want to hazard a guess
as to who's down with OBB?

05:55.856 --> 05:56.922
Huh?

05:58.324 --> 05:59.991
Every last Tandy.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.226
Oh, come on.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.494
Tandy, ever since
Mike showed up,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.062
you don't have time
for me anymore.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.230
Oh, don't you dare.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.998
Uh, every time I try
to hang out with you,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.567
you're always either
with Gail or Melissa.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.802
That is not true!
Oh, yes, it is.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.971
You're just like
one of those guys who as soon

06:12.973 --> 06:14.806
as they get two girlfriends,
they just disappear.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.007
No, you know what?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.242
I'm your backup plan.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.477
Your number two.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.312
And it's totally
appropriate, Tandy,

06:20.314 --> 06:23.248
because that's exactly
how you make me feel.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.650
Like a big old number two.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.753
And you know where
you dropped that stinky?

06:27.755 --> 06:30.889
Right here.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.891
On my heart.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.168
Yes, yes.
Here we are. Okay.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.837
You still waiting
on your date there, ma'am?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.606
Oh, I lied about that
to keep the creeps away.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.673
Really?

06:48.675 --> 06:50.242
Would you mind
if I joined you, then?

06:50.244 --> 06:51.543
I don't know. Are you a creep?

06:51.545 --> 06:52.744
Yeah, I think so.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.113
(laughs):
Well, in that case, sit down.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.849
All right,
let that be there.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.017
Yeah.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.052
Although, I feel like
I should tell you,

07:01.054 --> 07:02.754
I am carrying
another man's baby.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.189
You are? Wow.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.390
Well, that's complicated.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.925
On the plus side,

07:06.927 --> 07:09.060
I am the only single woman
left on the planet.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.695
Ah. Okay.
See, I can work with that.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.063
That's nice, yeah.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.698
Well, I guess, if we're being
honest with each other,

07:13.700 --> 07:15.467
I should let you know
that I'm, uh, married.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.369
Chef Miyagi!
Mm-hmm.

07:17.371 --> 07:18.703
Yeah, but it's okay.
I'm getting a divorce soon.

07:18.705 --> 07:21.106
Yeah, my brother's actually
sleeping with my wife.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.607
(laughs)

07:30.149 --> 07:32.451
(groans)
Water.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.152
It burns my throat.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.954
I just don't like it.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.622
You'll get used to it.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.424
Maybe I'll try putting
an olive in it.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.126
Transition into
it, you know?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.594
(groans)
Hello.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.430
Oh, Geez of Nazareth!

07:45.432 --> 07:47.265
Man, you got to stop

07:47.267 --> 07:49.801
coming up on me
like that, Carol.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.404
I'm gonna start making people
wear bells around their necks.

07:52.406 --> 07:55.807
Uh, Gail's trying to stop
drinking, so she's a little...

07:55.809 --> 07:58.243
Well, you saw her.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.412
Well, good
for you, Gail.

08:00.414 --> 08:03.148
And as a show of solidarity,
I'm gonna join you.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.783
I can't drink, anyway.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.685
Baby on board. Beep, beep!

08:06.687 --> 08:07.819
Out of my way!

08:07.821 --> 08:09.688
(laughs) Yeah.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.156
Not drinking for two now.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.924
Well, good luck with that.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.726
Looks like I'm drinking
for four now.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.137
Hey, this is
actually pretty easy.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.007
Yeah, that motion seems to
come to you pretty naturally.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.308
(laughs)

08:30.310 --> 08:31.810
(coughing)

08:31.812 --> 08:33.445
Doing okay?

08:33.447 --> 08:34.446
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

08:34.448 --> 08:35.647
Just a little tuckered out,
is all.

08:35.649 --> 08:36.948
You're a little tuckered out?

08:36.950 --> 08:38.617
That's funny, I thought
your name was Mike. Boom.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.784
Solid.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.052
(chuckles):
I know.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.254
Hey, bud.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.356
I just want to thank you

08:44.358 --> 08:45.690
for having sex
with Carol and stuff.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.459
It-it meant a lot to me.

08:47.461 --> 08:49.828
To be honest with you, I'm
really excited to be an uncle.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.830
Well, you're gonna be
a godfather, too.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.132
Well, I guess that's better than
being a godfather three. Boom.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.133
Solid.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.735
I know.
(chuckles)

08:56.737 --> 08:58.036
So what do you say?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.338
You want to be our godfather?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.474
(imitating Vito Corleone):
It's an offer I can't refuse.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.809
I don't underst...
Why are you talking like that?

09:04.811 --> 09:05.577
TODD:
Well, well, well.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.145
Oh, hey, bud.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.380
How hangs it?

09:08.382 --> 09:10.015
I was just coming by
to get some milk,

09:10.017 --> 09:12.517
but you guys probably already
dried her out, didn't you?

09:12.519 --> 09:14.486
Oh, come on, Toddler.

09:14.488 --> 09:15.987
I'm not a toddler.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.188
I'm a man.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.690
Hey, Mike is my brother,
(coughing)

09:18.692 --> 09:20.559
and I'm going to spend time
with him,

09:20.561 --> 09:22.394
and I will not
apologize for that.

09:22.396 --> 09:23.762
I'm sorry.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.897
Oh, yeah, make me seem
like the crazy one, huh?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.198
(coughing)
"Todd's upset at Tandy

09:27.200 --> 09:28.867
for hanging out
with his brother."

09:28.869 --> 09:30.535
Huh? Is that how
you're gonna spin this?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.003
I'm not spinning it.
(coughing continues)

09:32.005 --> 09:34.506
If anything,
I'm keeping it firmly in place!

09:34.508 --> 09:36.908
Okay, you know what?
It's time to face facts, Tandy.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.044
Here's the thing,
ever since he showed up,

09:39.046 --> 09:40.845
you don't have any time...

09:42.114 --> 09:44.082
Good God.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.797
It's just a cold, okay?
Or allergies.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.865
But Todd said he
coughed up blood!

10:00.867 --> 10:02.634
You know what? Uh, Todd's
just spreading rumors.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.069
Yeah, that's right.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.404
You know where he works?
At the rumor mill.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.973
Yeah, and, uh, you
know what his name

10:07.975 --> 10:09.708
would be if Bruce Willis
was his dad?

10:10.576 --> 10:13.078
Rumer.
It's not a rumor.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.913
Yes, it is. I mean,
this is clearly revenge

10:14.915 --> 10:16.548
'cause you're so jealous
of me and Mike.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.050
And that, my friend,
is what's not a rumor.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.585
No, that's a
Tallulah and Scout.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.621
Bruce Willis's
other kids.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.222
Tandy, whatever is
going on between us,

10:24.224 --> 10:25.423
this is bigger.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.158
Now, I saw it. It was blood.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.593
You need to tell the truth.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.161
Okay, okay.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.796
There might have been,
uh, just a teeny,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.131
tiny little bit of blood.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.066
(groans)
But I've coughed
up blood,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.101
like, a million times,

10:36.103 --> 10:37.168
and that doesn't mean

10:37.170 --> 10:38.570
that I have the virus, right?

10:38.572 --> 10:39.904
He's fine.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.406
But does he have the rash?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.307
Not on his genitals.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.309
Sorry, Tandy.
Just trying to help.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.510
(Mike coughing)

10:45.512 --> 10:47.412
Oh.
Where are you going?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.580
Away from him.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.582
Why are you all panicking?

10:50.584 --> 10:52.283
We're immune, remember?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.752
We're all safe.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.688
Not all of us.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.023
Oh, my God.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.824
What about our babies?

10:59.826 --> 11:01.760
TODD: There is no guarantee
that those babies

11:01.762 --> 11:03.595
will be immune to the virus.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.930
Yeah, Tandy. Do you want to give
the virus to the babies,

11:05.932 --> 11:07.098
you dumb son of a bitch?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.267
Oh, Gail, have a drink!

11:09.269 --> 11:10.769
(throwing her voice):
I agree with Erica.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.270
Who said that? Todd?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.773
Thank you for seconding
Erica's statement.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.108
I agree with Todd and Erica.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.278
Look, I am telling you,
Mike is fine.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.380
I'm out of here.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.051
On your tail.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.519
Wait for me.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.021
Takes me a little longer
to get up these days.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.557
Already on the second trimester
of my first week.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.825
You're going, too?

11:33.827 --> 11:35.160
Sorry, Tandy,
but I don't think

11:35.162 --> 11:37.529
we can afford
to take a chance here.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.468
So we're just gonna
leave him, huh?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.403
We're just gonna let him
wake up all alone

11:45.405 --> 11:47.839
and try to piece together
what the hell happened?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.308
We can't be
stupid about this.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.810
Well, maybe there's a way to be

11:51.812 --> 11:54.379
smart and stupid
at the same time.

11:54.381 --> 11:58.249
(coughing)

12:18.370 --> 12:19.738
Sup, dawg?

12:19.740 --> 12:20.872
Don't be alarmed.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.508
Why on earth would I be alarmed?

12:23.510 --> 12:25.510
(chuckles)
That's the spirit.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.278
Hey, why don't you come
on into the living room

12:27.280 --> 12:28.847
and have a seat, huh?

12:36.522 --> 12:38.723
ERICA:
Oh, Jenga!

12:38.725 --> 12:40.892
(Tandy clears throat)

12:40.894 --> 12:43.128
Look who I found, huh?

12:43.130 --> 12:46.364
What do you say we go
join the group, huh?

12:46.366 --> 12:47.565
Right this way.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.567
Don't be shy.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.202
If you guys could
make a little room.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.273
Nice of Melissa to clear
you a little spot there.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.476
Hey, Mike.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.246
Hi.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.947
So how was your
little nappy-poo?

13:05.584 --> 13:07.585
Do I have the virus?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.120
Well, I mean,
you know...

13:09.122 --> 13:10.889
Maybe.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.123
Okay, yeah.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.391
Look, l-look.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.226
These guys think that
there's, uh, you know,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.595
just a-a small possibility
that you might just have,

13:17.597 --> 13:19.430
like, a-a teeny-tiny
touch of the virus.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.332
Just-just a
smidgen, really.
Okay.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.234
Okay, okay.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.803
I mean, we're
not worried.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.137
I mean, not one bit.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.807
Yeah, you guys reek
of confidence.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.510
So I assume
that thing's for me, huh?

13:35.147 --> 13:38.416
Hey, look, we're doing this
'cause we care about you.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.319
We just have to be
careful, you know?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.188
So why don't you
just pop in there,

13:43.190 --> 13:45.824
ride out this cold,

13:45.826 --> 13:49.093
and one day, we'll all
laugh at this like hyenas.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.762
(chuckles)

13:50.764 --> 13:53.131
Where do I go to the bathroom?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.533
Oh, don't worry.
We got that all taken care of.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.968
(quietly):
Todd, go get me a bucket.

13:56.970 --> 14:00.271
This is gonna be great, bud.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.173
Yeah, we're just gonna have
a nice normal night.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.675
And who knows?

14:03.677 --> 14:06.945
Maybe you'll even have
a little fun along the way.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.346
TODD:<i> Miley Cyrus!</i>
MELISSA:<i> Yes!</i>

14:08.348 --> 14:10.715
Uh, okay, this guy's dead
from the virus.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.884
Lead singer of U2.
Uh, Bono!

14:12.886 --> 14:14.018
Yes! Okay.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.621
Um, this guy's regular dead.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.690
Uh, "Frankly, Scarlett,
I don't give a damn."

14:18.692 --> 14:19.858
Uh, Clark Gable!
Yes.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.492
Five seconds!
Okay, okay, okay, um...

14:21.494 --> 14:22.727
Dead New England
Patriots quarterback,

14:22.729 --> 14:24.729
married to the dead model,
both from the virus.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.197
Tom Brady!
Yes!

14:26.199 --> 14:27.999
TANDY: Time!
Yes!

14:28.001 --> 14:31.302
Guys, do we have to say that the
person's dead every single time?

14:31.304 --> 14:33.238
You know, it just seems like
a major buzz kill.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.706
Well, an even bigger buzz kill

14:34.708 --> 14:37.308
is losing the game
due to lack of clarity.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.543
You want to go, Mike?

14:38.545 --> 14:39.978
Uh, no, no, I'm fine.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.546
Aw, come on, Chef Miyagi.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.481
Come on, come on.
Mike, Mike...

14:43.483 --> 14:44.883
ALL (chanting):
Mike, Mike, Mike...

14:44.885 --> 14:46.851
O... Okay, okay, okay,
all right.

14:46.853 --> 14:48.353
Ready, go.
Okay.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.988
Um, I'm not sure how to
describe this person.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.823
Enrique Iglesias!
No.

14:51.825 --> 14:52.824
Julio Iglesias!

14:52.826 --> 14:54.325
Let him get a clue out.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.760
I got a method!

14:55.762 --> 14:57.262
Uh, just pass.
Pass on this one. Pass.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.663
(coughs)

14:58.665 --> 15:00.832
Okay, uh, this person
was on<i> Seinfeld.</i>

15:00.834 --> 15:01.933
Seinfeld!

15:01.935 --> 15:03.735
No, close.
Glenn Close!

15:03.737 --> 15:05.670
No, I-I don't know if
you're gonna get this one.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.105
It just says, um,

15:07.107 --> 15:09.340
"The dead guy who
played Newman."

15:09.342 --> 15:11.276
I don't know, um...

15:11.278 --> 15:12.777
Hey, can we maybe do
something else, maybe? Just...

15:12.779 --> 15:14.579
What's wrong, Mike?

15:14.581 --> 15:18.116
It's just a little weird,
you know, just...

15:18.118 --> 15:19.450
The suits.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.885
It's the friggin' suits.
I knew it.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.387
Well, you know what?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.454
Tandy, no!

15:23.456 --> 15:26.124
No. Look, it's fine, okay?

15:26.126 --> 15:27.392
He has a cold.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.093
That's it.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.862
Now, look at this.

15:30.864 --> 15:34.899
I'm taking my friggin' suit off,
and the world is still turning.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.234
All right?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.069
So what do you say?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.972
Does anybody else
want to join me?

15:46.645 --> 15:48.446
So this is actually
a pretty typical

15:48.448 --> 15:49.914
second date for me, you know.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.582
(chuckles)
Yeah.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.751
You know,
first date, always hibachi,

15:53.753 --> 15:56.287
and then the second date,
I like to invite a lady

15:56.289 --> 15:58.456
back to my quarantine bubble,
and, you know...

15:58.458 --> 15:59.724
Mm. (chuckles)

15:59.726 --> 16:02.627
Yeah, you're a real
smooth operator, Mike.

16:02.629 --> 16:03.628
(both laugh)

16:03.630 --> 16:06.230
(coughs)

16:09.101 --> 16:10.501
(sniffles)

16:10.503 --> 16:11.769
(clears throat)

16:11.771 --> 16:15.907
Sorry my sickness is,
uh, you know, scaring you.

16:15.909 --> 16:17.575
I'm not worried.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.478
Yeah, I think I'm coming
around to Tandy's theory.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.146
It's just a cold.

16:26.018 --> 16:28.453
Would it be okay if I, uh...

16:28.455 --> 16:30.555
It would.

16:37.129 --> 16:40.531
Hang on, let's...
let's do this right.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.838
(chuckles)

16:51.677 --> 16:52.944
TANDY:
Ooh!

16:52.946 --> 16:54.512
(all oohing)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.514
(whooping)

16:56.516 --> 16:57.782
Oh, my God,
you guys, hurry!

16:57.784 --> 16:59.751
Come quick!

17:09.028 --> 17:11.095
Oh, farts.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.668
Oh, you poor little thing.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.171
Your mama's gone,
but you still got us.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.206
Has Mike been around this cow?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.741
He was milking it today.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.209
He has to go, now.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.845
There's no way the virus
could take down a cow

17:27.847 --> 17:29.313
in, like, six hours.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.748
Then how else do you explain it?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.150
Uh, you know, uh, uh...

17:32.152 --> 17:33.518
It could have been old age.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.019
Uh, the cow could
have had, like,

17:35.021 --> 17:37.021
some congenital hoof disorder.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.556
Uh, hell, could have
been this little guy!

17:38.558 --> 17:41.359
I mean, look at him
and those demon eyes.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.027
No, Tandy.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.196
That cow survived the virus
just like us,

17:45.198 --> 17:46.531
and now look at her.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.732
I'm with Melissa.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.900
Three strikes, you're out.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.168
Let's do this.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.270
But you...
Oh, wait!

17:52.272 --> 17:54.205
You forgot your
friggin' pitchforks

17:54.207 --> 17:56.207
and your torches!

17:56.209 --> 17:58.042
Hey, whoa! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! What's going on?!

17:58.044 --> 18:00.211
I'm sorry, bud.
We're moving you, all right?

18:00.213 --> 18:01.712
What? What? Why? What happened?!
We got him.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.181
Get out of here!
Come on, guys...

18:03.183 --> 18:05.583
Get away from him!
What are you doing?!

18:05.585 --> 18:08.719
If you move him, you're gonna
have to move me, too.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.021
Great. Todd, move Tandy.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.222
Todd!

18:11.224 --> 18:13.257
I friggin' love you, man.

18:13.259 --> 18:17.395
But if you take one more step,
I will friggin' rip you apart.

18:17.397 --> 18:20.465
Phil, if they want me to go,
I'll just go.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.935
No! Mike, you're staying
right here.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.904
This is my brother.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.907
Okay? My own flesh and blood.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.110
Until two weeks ago,

18:32.112 --> 18:34.779
I thought I had
lost him forever.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.115
What are the chances?

18:37.117 --> 18:40.751
The entire world dies--
there's seven of us--

18:40.753 --> 18:44.255
and my brother shows up.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.157
That is not a coincidence.

18:47.993 --> 18:51.162
I said good-bye to him once.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.966
I am not gonna do it again.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.736
He has a friggin' cold.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.171
(coughing)

19:00.173 --> 19:03.975
Come on, we got to find
a house for the night.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.122
You mind if I stay
with Mike tonight?

19:18.124 --> 19:19.123
All right?

19:19.125 --> 19:20.958
Okay, it's fine.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.293
Just be careful.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.395
You're the best.
You're the best.

19:28.534 --> 19:29.700
CAROL:
Okay, Mike.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.935
Good night.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.703
Night.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.208
Phil, come on.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.043
Maybe I should just go away
for a while, all right?

19:39.045 --> 19:42.180
It's a cold, Mike.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.182
It's a cold.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.983
Yeah.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.486
All right, you want
to get some sleep?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.054
Sure.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.562
What do you think, 69 or 11?

19:57.564 --> 20:00.698
Why don't we start with 11
and go from there.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.733
Sure.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.469
(sniffles)

20:05.471 --> 20:06.537

20:12.211 --> 20:15.580
You want to do one
