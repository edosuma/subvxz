up to management,

12:21.283 --> 12:23.490
I know you...
I know you lied about
the involvement of the gang.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.201
| just stretched the truth.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.363
It's what friends do, right?

12:31.126 --> 12:32.332
Yeah.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.589
Alicia Fuentes was
trying to fabricate dirt
on my campaign finances.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.086
But she found nothing
that was illegal.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.760
So you weren't taking
money from management

12:43.847 --> 12:45.428
and selling your
constituents down the river?

12:45.515 --> 12:48.257
Contributions come
into my campaign
fund from all over.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.718
But I answer
only to my members
when it comes to voting.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.933
I wasn't the only one
Miss Fuentes
was investigating.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.309
You should check
out my opponent.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.106
I heard Jim Martin
runs a clean campaign.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.269
Nobody slides up
the political ranks
without a little grease.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.693
Are you speaking
from experience,
Mr. Barnes?

13:07.579 --> 13:10.912
with the kind of funds
that grassroots
can't provide.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.913
Jim is selling
himself as the candidate
that can't be bought,

13:15.003 --> 13:17.961
so there's a story
there somewhere.
At least there was.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.547
Oh, and I'm sure she got that
from a reputable source.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.584
Mr. Barnes, where
were you last night?

13:25.097 --> 13:28.055
Campaign rally,
lots of witnesses.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.303
But a man in your position,

13:30.435 --> 13:32.391
you must know
people that can
get things done.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.183
Make people go away.

13:37.442 --> 13:40.024
My assistant will get you
that list of witnesses.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.406
Thank you, sir.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.359
SADLER: So, I’ve been
trying to figure out

13:48.453 --> 13:50.034
how to repair
the injured circuits.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.112
I'm just gonna cut
out the damaged parts.

13:52.207 --> 13:54.698
Don't cut it!
lt'll only make it worse.

13:55.419 --> 13:57.000
Shoot
What?

14:00.132 --> 14:02.088
(GASPS) Holy moly.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.167
Oh, God. Alec,
what did you do?

14:05.262 --> 14:08.925
So I know that Carlos said
he wanted to see
footage after 2:00 am,

14:09.016 --> 14:10.847
but I was thinking,
what if someone

14:10.934 --> 14:12.674
was waiting for her
or followed her home?

14:12.769 --> 14:14.509
Can this wait for
just one minute?

14:14.604 --> 14:16.265
Just watch.
Okay.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.018
I couldn't find anything
on the CCTV feeds,

14:19.109 --> 14:22.897
but then I realized
Alicia's apartment
was on a bus route.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.942
Buses have cameras
on them and voila!

14:26.033 --> 14:27.318
We've got something.

14:29.619 --> 14:33.362
There's Alicia and her car.
Someone drove her home.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.954
Maybe it's her murderer.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.414
Are you getting this?

14:36.501 --> 14:37.581
SADLER: Yeah.
What?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.456
Are you getting
a better resolution?

14:40.714 --> 14:43.376
Yeah, I'm waiting
on a hi-res download
from the bus company

14:43.467 --> 14:45.423
which they promised
to have to me
by 10:00 tonight.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.133
So I should have
it in the morning.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.419
Thanks.

14:51.183 --> 14:53.595
Alec?
Normally I'd be in
the same boat as Betty.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.050
But?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.476
But since / hooked
your suit up to the system

14:56.563 --> 14:58.019
it's become super charged.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.680
Houston, we have an upgrade.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.769
I can give you
a clear-res image in...

15:01.860 --> 15:05.227
Three, two, one.

15:07.491 --> 15:08.606
Crap.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.278
How can you be so
sure Carlos isn't guilty?

15:15.373 --> 15:16.874
I mean, you've only known
him for a few months.

15:18.126 --> 15:19.582
It's the same amount
of time I've known you.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.668
Yes, but, I'm different.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.129
For all we know,
Carlos dropped
her off at the door,

15:24.216 --> 15:26.332
he may not even have come
in here last night.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.250
It ain ’t just
a river in Egypt!

15:29.679 --> 15:30.714
Denial, get it?

15:30.847 --> 15:31.927
No.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.351
Oh, that's trippy.
What did you do?

15:38.480 --> 15:41.847
| used a bio-enhancement mist,
it interacts with DNA.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.225
It helps my HUD
lD fingerprints.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.269
Each color represents
a different
individual's prints

15:47.364 --> 15:49.525
and the intensity

15:50.534 --> 15:52.775
tells me how recently
those prints were made.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.365
First thing we do
is cancel out prints
older than a week

15:57.207 --> 15:58.993
and then we cancel
out the victim's prints.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.247
Well, he's definitely
been in there.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.292
We were both in
here this morning.
Let me just...

16:16.184 --> 16:17.344
(BEEPING)

16:18.937 --> 16:20.598
I'm guessing that
leads to the bedroom?

16:30.949 --> 16:33.315
Oh, man, it doesn't
take too much to imagine

16:33.410 --> 16:35.275
how those prints
got there. (CHUCKLES)

16:48.925 --> 16:51.416
Alec, I've got
prints with no lD.

16:52.554 --> 16:53.839
Well, you're connected
to the national database.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.261
Whoever it was
doesn't have a record.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.055
You think there
was a three-way?

16:57.184 --> 16:58.549
I think that's
enough for today.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.097
What? It's just
getting good!
Goodbye, Alec!

17:04.733 --> 17:06.519
(ELECTRONIC WHIRRING)

17:15.160 --> 17:16.275
(GASPS)

17:17.454 --> 17:20.196
Come on, baby,
show me what you can do.

17:35.639 --> 17:36.845
(BEEPS)

17:48.318 --> 17:50.479
You saw the union
candidate last night.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.782
Can I talk to you?

18:02.791 --> 18:04.656
Why didn't you tell me
you were at Jim
Martin's place,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.288
or that you went to
see Alicia Fuentes
after that?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.748
Who told you that?

18:09.839 --> 18:10.828
You just did.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.966
How'd you find out?
That is not the point.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.965
You lied about sleeping
with a woman on the
night she was murdered.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.592
I had nothing to do
with Alicia's murder.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.675
You were the last person
to see her alive and that
makes you a suspect.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.600
Plus, it is definitely
a conflict of interest

18:24.729 --> 18:26.560
since you are
the primary on this case!

18:26.648 --> 18:28.513
Listen to me, if I admit
to being with Alicia,

18:28.608 --> 18:31.020
then the focus of
the investigation
immediately turns on me.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.727
They stop looking
for the real killer.
You know that!

18:34.197 --> 18:35.357
That's your excuse?

18:36.908 --> 18:39.069
What about Jim Martin?
You didn't tell
me you knew him.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.661
What is it that
you are covering up?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.904
Jim is an old friend, okay?
He grew up with
Alicia and l...

18:43.999 --> 18:45.079
That is not
enough of a reason.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.867
Okay, he called me up,
he said he was
arguing with Alicia.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.329
What were they arguing about?

18:52.674 --> 18:54.005
It doesn't matter, okay?

18:54.092 --> 18:55.628
Whatever happened
between Alicia and Jim

18:55.719 --> 18:57.550
had nothing to do
with her murder.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.339
He's a good guy, okay?

18:59.431 --> 19:02.298
He'sjust in the middle of
an important union election.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.012
So important that
you are willing to

19:05.103 --> 19:07.219
put your own
career on the line?

19:08.315 --> 19:09.725
You don't understand.

19:09.983 --> 19:13.271
Jim is a reformer in
one of the most corrupt
locals in the country.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.148
He will fight that corruption
and make it better
for the members.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.948
There's a lot of
people in management
who won't like that.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.031
Besides, he's a friend.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.077
And you trust him?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.328
Yes, with my life.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.214
Okay.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.084
(SIGHS)

19:41.097 --> 19:44.885
So someone could've
framed Jim to sabotage
his chances at this election?

19:45.185 --> 19:48.848
He has made a lot of enemies
in the old boys club,
including Barnes.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.137
ljust need
a little bit more time.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.395
I don't know how
much I can give you.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.519
Betty found footage
of you and Alicia.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.987
It's too grainy to
make out your face,

20:00.075 --> 20:01.565
but she's working on
resolving the image.

20:01.659 --> 20:02.739
And when she does, she'll...

20:02.827 --> 20:04.237
Okay, I'll handle it. Okay?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.364
I need to know
that I can rely on you

20:08.458 --> 20:09.698
to keep me and
Jim out of this.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.203
Okay? Just for now.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.001
Fine. Jim is off-limits.

for Jim Martin.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.351

his campaign manager.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.320
Uh, let me see if
Jim has a minute.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.235
Sara, get in here
and tell Heather
she has to...

20:43.326 --> 20:46.443
Jim, this is Agent Cameron.
She has some questions.

20:47.372 --> 20:48.452
How can I help you?

20:49.207 --> 20:50.913
I'd like to talk
about Alicia Fuentes.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.827
Yes. I heard
about the murder.

20:55.046 --> 20:56.422
I don't know,
I don't trust him.

20:57.215 --> 20:58.204
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:58.299 --> 21:00.836
Uh, this is
my wife, Heather.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.508
Agent Cameron.

21:03.555 --> 21:04.761
I don't trust her, either.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.266
I heard about Alicia.
lt's horrible.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.799
What can we do to help?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.388
When was the last time
you saw her, Mr. Martin?

21:13.273 --> 21:15.480
I don't remember
how long itwas, um...

21:16.818 --> 21:19.275
Sara?
One, two months ago.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.651
Are you sure?

21:21.239 --> 21:23.776
I know she was writing
an article about you.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.530
Well, we've, um, talked
on the phone a few times.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.027
Really?

21:29.456 --> 21:31.287
I also happen to
know that she was
here last night

21:31.416 --> 21:33.281
and that you spoke with her.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.286
It was only for
a brief moment.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.834
She came here about
an article that
she was writing

21:40.925 --> 21:42.881
with accusations
of financial fraud.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.881
What she had was all fiction,
but she wouldn't leave.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.932
Mrs. Martin, did
you witness this?

21:52.645 --> 21:55.057
Actually, no,
l was at a fundraiser,

21:55.148 --> 21:57.981
helping legitimate donors
give to Jim's campaign.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.772
Sara was there with me,
she can confirm that.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.071
(DOOR CLOSING)
Greg sent me to
see if you were okay.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.236
What happened to the painting?

22:13.958 --> 22:15.459
Rikki, I don't know
how to do this.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.285
We've been friends with
you and Trevor for so long.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.795
I know he was drunk, but...

22:21.716 --> 22:23.502
Trevor came in here
and made a pass at me.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.928
Oh! What an ass!

22:26.679 --> 22:27.794
lfeel terrible.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.925
Oh, you shouldn't.
It was just a pass.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.306
Besides, you never let
what happened
with Greg and l

22:32.393 --> 22:33.644
affect our friendship,

22:33.728 --> 22:35.639
and I'm not gonna let
a little pass
affect it either.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.311
What are you talking about?

22:37.398 --> 22:39.138
When Greg and I
had a little fling

22:40.235 --> 22:41.600
before your wedding?

22:43.821 --> 22:46.153
Kiera! I thought...

22:50.245 --> 22:51.530
Greg never told me.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.112
He never said a word.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.287
Because it meant nothing!

22:55.375 --> 22:57.991
He was just sowing his oats
before the marriage.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.164
He loves you,
you know that.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.043
I'm surprised you
never found out.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.465
I mean, you're
a CPS officer,

23:07.428 --> 23:09.384
you have access
to all the records.

23:10.348 --> 23:12.384
Why would I spy on Greg?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.385
I never had a reason
not to trust him.

23:17.188 --> 23:21.431
lfl had your tech,
I'd be scanning to see
what Trevor was up to

23:21.526 --> 23:23.266
every minute of the day.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.400
Do you need me
here for this?

23:28.658 --> 23:30.944
I need to get back to,
uh, getting ready for
the rally tonight.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.528
Yes, actually I have
some questions
for you as well.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.239
Agent Cameron,
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.079
lfyou have any
further questions,

23:40.169 --> 23:42.751
you're gonna have to contact
Mr. Martin's attorney.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.790
I'll show myself out.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.134
You think this Jim guy knows
something about the murder?

23:54.434 --> 23:57.301
I think he had
an affair with Alicia,
I think his wife knows.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.805
How’d you figure that out?

23:59.731 --> 24:00.891
ljust know.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.522
I need you to get me
everything you can
on Heather Martin,

24:03.610 --> 24:06.272
including her whereabouts
for the last 36 hours.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.316
I may have a suspect
to exonerate Carlos.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.179
Kiera, do you know
what your suit can do?

24:35.600 --> 24:37.556
lt's online,
it's accessing
every single visual

24:37.727 --> 24:39.683
and audio feed within
a 100-kilometer radius

24:39.812 --> 24:41.848
on its own. It's like it's
taking its own bearings,

24:42.357 --> 24:43.847
its own sensory
proprioception.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.890
Thanks, Alec. Good work.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.522
But, uh, did you
find anything on
Heather Martin?

24:48.655 --> 24:52.239
Her maiden name
is Heather Axe/rod,
a real jock in high school.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.107
Gymnastics, women's lacrosse,

24:54.202 --> 24:56.363
went to University of Alberta
on a sports scholarship.

24:56.954 --> 25:00.082
Uh, married to Jim Martin
for 13 years, no children.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.245
Oh! And did I mention
she also made several
calls to your victim

25:03.336 --> 25:04.371
in the past two weeks?

25:04.462 --> 25:05.793
Most of them hang-ups.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.340
Where was she last night?

25:08.424 --> 25:11.006
At a fundraiser
until 10:30 pm,
just like she said.

25:11.386 --> 25:12.501
Election money.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.466
lf Alicia was writing
an article about
campaign contributions,

25:15.556 --> 25:17.888
we need to look into
both candidates' finances.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.685
I'll follow the cash.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.898
Damn it!
What?

25:29.070 --> 25:32.437
The piece of the time
travel device is missing.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.280
What, someone took it?

25:35.618 --> 25:37.950
There's only one person
that could've done this.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.194
Kellog.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.080
What's he gonna do,
sell it to the gang?
No.

25:43.793 --> 25:45.704
He's gonna use it as
leverage against me.

25:47.296 --> 25:49.002
Now what?
Now?

25:50.633 --> 25:52.248
I'll just have to get it back.

25:59.976 --> 26:02.558
That's not what it
looks like, okay?
I didn't kill her.

26:02.687 --> 26:03.767
I know that.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.771
I can say there was
an internal glitch
in my computer,

26:07.859 --> 26:08.939
that the information
was lost...

26:09.026 --> 26:10.152
No.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.896
l have to take care of this.

26:14.991 --> 26:16.071
Yeah, you do.

26:29.547 --> 26:30.707
Yeah?

that murder case?

I looking at?

26:50.485 --> 26:53.022
I knew the victim,
Alicia Fuentes.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.527
Excuse me?
I was with her that night.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.649
I met her for dinner,
I took her back
to her place.

27:01.412 --> 27:04.529
I had sex with her
and then I left
about 1:30 am.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.121
Sir, I didn't kill her.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.787
You have any idea
what you've done?

27:09.128 --> 27:10.413
Taking primary
on a murder case

27:10.546 --> 27:11.877
where you just had
sex with the victim?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.341

27:43.788 --> 27:45.870
There ’3 no security
footage, no nothing.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.660
So no way to see what went
on inside the building?

27:49.544 --> 27:51.159
What, do they
do that in 2077?

27:51.254 --> 27:52.289
Sort of.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.831
Alec, if I could get you
a complete spectrum analysis

27:55.925 --> 27:59.042
of the cellular array
from the night of the murder,

27:59.136 --> 28:01.343
would you be
able to analyze it
for wavelength and strength?

28:01.931 --> 28:03.091
That's a fixed
point near the scene?

28:04.225 --> 28:07.217
There's a cellular array
on the top of
Alicia's building.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.844
It's perfect.
Those towers pump out
a strong, steady signal

28:09.939 --> 28:11.304
like a waterfall.

28:11.399 --> 28:14.391
Any people in the
building might register as
a disruption in the field,

28:14.485 --> 28:15.816
like putting your hand
under a running tap.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.651
I could, theoretically,
map out the areas

28:17.780 --> 28:19.395
where the signal's
interfered with by humans

28:21.784 --> 28:24.366
Then you could
feed the information
through my CMR

28:24.453 --> 28:26.489
and we can simulate
the LlDAR function
on my suit.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.446
Yeah, it might paint
a perfect picture for you

28:28.583 --> 28:30.164
but it's a ton of
data to sift through.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.120
But you'd have my suit
to process the data.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.421
Sure. That should work.

28:37.758 --> 28:38.793
Great, so then all
you have to do

28:38.885 --> 28:40.500
is hack the cell phone
company’s servers.

28:40.595 --> 28:43.086
No, I need raw data streams
from the night in question.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.425

was the extra
financing to get there,

refused to deal with
any large contributor,

37:18.028 --> 37:19.609
so I did it for you.

37:22.116 --> 37:23.481

ruin your reputation

much to lose as you did

you the money?

I say anything else,
they're gonna kill me, too.

to my attorney.

to come down to the station,

from the two of you.

have to wait a little longer.

I'll return the money.
I didn't know.

38:21.175 --> 38:23.086

and you lied

to me about Alicia,
about everything.

38:25.262 --> 38:27.628
It was politics, okay?

38:28.098 --> 38:29.258
It wasn't personal.

(SCOFFS) We're done.

38:37.608 --> 38:40.224
So did Sara give up
the source of the
illegal contributions yet?

38:40.986 --> 38:43.352
No, and my guess is she won't.

38:44.156 --> 38:46.112
She knows we don’t have
any physical evidence

38:46.200 --> 38:48.191
tying her directly
to the murder.

38:48.535 --> 38:51.948
She'll admit to
the financial fraud,
she'll make a plea deal...

38:52.456 --> 38:54.242
Her political
career will be over,

38:55.167 --> 38:56.703
but / doubt she’ll
see anyjai/ time.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.454
At least you got
Carlos off the hook.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.960
Yeah.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.087
Uh, I gotta go.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.925
(EXHALES) They dropped
the obstruction
ofjustice charges.

39:07.888 --> 39:08.968
That's great.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.171
(PHONE RINGING)

39:18.524 --> 39:19.639
(CARLOS EXHALES)

39:19.900 --> 39:20.980
Are you okay?

39:21.818 --> 39:24.730
Yeah. Jim won the election.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.317
This whole thing
has been one big lie.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.700
Man, how could I
have been so stupid?

39:40.754 --> 39:42.745
Rikki told me
about the affair.

39:50.556 --> 39:54.265
Look, it was a long time ago,
it was before we were married,

39:54.351 --> 39:56.933
and as soon as it happened
I realized it was a mistake.

39:57.938 --> 40:00.145
What other secrets
are you keeping from me?

40:00.566 --> 40:02.397
Do I need to pull
all of your digital files?

40:02.568 --> 40:03.774
Kiera...

40:03.902 --> 40:05.108
We have this technology

40:05.320 --> 40:07.732
scanning our every move,

40:07.823 --> 40:10.860
keeping us honest
so we don't have any secrets.

40:15.205 --> 40:19.574
But I always
thought that if you
really loved someone,

40:21.169 --> 40:24.036
yourhusband,
yourbestfnend,

40:26.633 --> 40:29.545
that you wouldn't
have to rely on tech.

40:32.973 --> 40:34.509
How naive is that?

40:34.641 --> 40:36.177
No, that's not naive.

40:36.310 --> 40:39.222
That's how it should be.

40:42.149 --> 40:43.639
Look”.

40:45.027 --> 40:47.939
I was afraid that
if I told you,

40:48.030 --> 40:49.486
you'd never agree
to marry me.

40:51.033 --> 40:53.024
I don't think I
could risk losing you.

40:54.870 --> 40:57.532
You can always come up with
an excuse to justify lying.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.739
Kiera, I love you.

41:04.212 --> 41:06.168
What can I do to
make this right?

41:07.633 --> 41:10.966
I swear I will never keep
a secret from you again.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.727
and you think they'll
never betray you...

41:22.898 --> 41:25.435
You were just
being a good friend.

41:25.859 --> 41:27.190
(CHEERING)

41:27.277 --> 41:29.393
Speaks highly of you
and poorly of them.

41:36.453 --> 41:38.364
(SIGHS) Yeah, I guess.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.247
Look, I'm sorry that
I kept information
from you on the case.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.080
I'm sorry that
I went to Jim
behind your back.

41:45.587 --> 41:46.793
(SCOFFS)

41:47.464 --> 41:48.749
(CHUCKLES)

41:50.467 --> 41:53.129
Lets,uhu.
Let's make a pact, huh?

41:54.262 --> 41:56.799
No more secrets
from each other,
100% honesty.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.596
What do you think?

41:59.810 --> 42:02.677
I think that's where
we get into trouble.

42:04.231 --> 42:06.643
Sometimes you have
to do the wrong thing
for the right reason,

42:07.651 --> 42:11.690
and Iwould rather
keep a secret from you
than break a promise to you.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.646
I get it.

42:15.701 --> 42:17.737
We do have a loose end.

42:18.912 --> 42:19.992
Our killer.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.250
We know she was a woman.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.792
Strong, agile.

42:33.427 --> 42:34.883
She was quite a fighter.

42:37.431 --> 42:41.299
And your friend Jim,
now that he's
won the election...

42:43.478 --> 42:47.187
He controls everything
that goes in and
out of the ports.

42:48.316 --> 42:51.183
And from there it's just
a quickjump to mayor.

42:52.195 --> 42:55.187
This is the gentleman
I told you about.

42:57.617 --> 42:59.869
Congratulations
on your win.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.245
Now let's talk
about the future.

43:10.714 --> 43:12.625
This just got
a lot more complicated.
