ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:36.411 --> 00:38.622
welcome to the Redneck
Comedy Tour!

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165
Featuring Stink Fleaman!

00:40.249 --> 00:41.542
You know you're a redneck

00:41.625 --> 00:44.628
if you come from a rural area
and behave as such.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.963
(audience laughs)

00:46.046 --> 00:47.464
Mike Drunkbeater.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.174
Oh, that dog of mine!

00:49.258 --> 00:50.676
(audience laughs)

00:50.759 --> 00:53.136
Walt "Coffee & Pie"
Abernathy.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.388
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:54.471 --> 00:56.223
(audience laughs)

00:56.306 --> 01:00.102
And Larry, the guy who works
for the department of water and power.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.813
You tell me how
that got in there!

01:02.896 --> 01:05.524
Whoo!

01:05.607 --> 01:06.608
(laughing)

01:06.692 --> 01:07.693
He's right.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.611
Who knows how that got in there?

01:09.695 --> 01:10.946
Peter, can we
please go now?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.030
This is excruciating.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.532
Are you kidding, Brian?

01:13.615 --> 01:16.118
These men and their redneck
lifestyle really speak to me.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.245
This is the greatest show
I've seen in years.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.622
Not like the last time
I was at a comedy club.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.124
I hear this guy's hilarious.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.250
He played Kramer,
you know.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.878
Oh, this is
gonna be fun!

01:29.047 --> 01:32.217
(car horn playing "Dixie")

01:36.096 --> 01:38.932
Peter, wh-what the hell are you
doing with a pickup truck?

01:39.016 --> 01:40.434
Wait. Let me guess.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.686
This is because of the Redneck
Comedy Festival, isn't it?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.229
(Southern accent):
Oh, that dog of mine.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.231
Peter, you can't suddenly decide
to be a redneck

01:46.315 --> 01:47.733
just because of some show.

01:47.816 --> 01:48.984
Some show?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.069
Lois, those men showed me
the way to an identity

01:51.153 --> 01:53.155
I've been searching for
my whole life.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.949
I am going to do everything
a redneck is supposed to do.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.951
Ugh! This is going
to be more painful to watch

01:58.035 --> 02:00.370
than when he ate
half a Fudgesicle in one bite.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.748
Oh, boy! A Fudgesicle!

02:05.042 --> 02:06.335
(shuddering)

02:06.418 --> 02:09.296
(screaming)

02:09.379 --> 02:10.839
(explosion)

02:13.008 --> 02:14.801
Chris, what happened
to the couch?

02:14.885 --> 02:16.261
Dad dragged it out on the lawn,

02:16.345 --> 02:19.181
'cause he said
that's what rednecks do.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.435
Hey, Meg, come here.
Have a seat.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.355
(yawns)

02:26.438 --> 02:28.899
Dad, what
are you doing?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.234
Meg, I'm a redneck,

02:30.317 --> 02:32.486
which means I am about
to do something to you

02:32.569 --> 02:35.113
that you will not remember
until you're 40.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.074
(screaming)

02:37.157 --> 02:39.826
Meg, come back here!
I meant sex!

02:42.746 --> 02:45.707
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to Carl Sagan's Cosmos,

02:45.791 --> 02:47.251
edited for rednecks.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.002
I'm Carl Sagan.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.629
Just how old is our planet?

02:50.712 --> 02:52.673
Scientists believe
it's four bil...

02:52.756 --> 02:55.008
MAN: ...hundreds and hundreds
of years old.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.136
SAGAN: Scientists have determined that
the universe was created by...

02:58.220 --> 03:01.473
MAN:
God!

03:01.557 --> 03:03.517
SAGAN: ...big bang.
If you look at the bones of a...

03:03.600 --> 03:05.227
MAN:
Jesus.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.188
SAGAN: ...aurus Rex, it's clear, by the
use of carbon-dating that...

03:08.272 --> 03:11.316
MAN: Mountain Dew
is the best soda ever made.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.985
Peter, do we have
to watch this?

03:13.068 --> 03:14.862
This is what
rednecks watch, Brian.

03:18.282 --> 03:21.243
Peter, that's disgusting.
Here. Spit in this cup instead.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.372
Oh, there's
my apple juice.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.623
Stewie, wait. Don't...

03:26.707 --> 03:28.000
(groaning)

03:28.083 --> 03:30.294
Where's my money?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.087
You going to
give me my money?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.338
Aw, never mind.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.341
(screaming)

03:37.342 --> 03:39.344
(screaming)

03:45.684 --> 03:47.311
Hey, Brian, check it out!

03:47.394 --> 03:49.229
Peter, you
painted over the back window.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.314
Isn't that dangerous?

03:50.397 --> 03:51.440
I'm a redneck, Brian.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.025
We like people
driving behind us

03:53.108 --> 03:54.693
to know what
our beliefs are.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.488
(tires squealing)

04:00.949 --> 04:03.035
Peter, what the hell?!
My car!

04:03.118 --> 04:04.786
(girls yelling in Thai)

04:04.870 --> 04:06.246
Aw, damn it!
Hey! Hey, come back!

04:06.330 --> 04:08.123
(yelling in Thai) Huy! Ja pai nai?
Ma nee! Eee dok!

04:08.207 --> 04:11.168
Koo j ignun pai laew! Kee
kohng! Koo tok lohng gahp paw!

04:11.251 --> 04:12.794
Tamai mai tum tam?

04:12.878 --> 04:14.171
Oh, sorry, Quagmire.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.048
How the hell am I supposed
to get to the airport?!

04:16.131 --> 04:17.966
I got to fly a plane
in 20 minutes.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.718
Oh, I can drive you.
I got a pickup truck. See?

04:19.801 --> 04:20.802
Well, come on!

04:20.886 --> 04:23.055
(tires squealing)

04:23.138 --> 04:25.140
(yelling in Thai)

04:25.224 --> 04:26.892
Quagmire, I am so sorry.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.560
Don't worry about it.
We can go after them.

04:28.644 --> 04:30.187
Don't worry about it.
They're tagged! They're tagged!

04:30.270 --> 04:31.647
Just get me
to the airport.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.858
(tires squealing)

04:41.532 --> 04:42.950
All right.
Thanks a lot, Peter.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.799
(romantic music plays)

04:58.882 --> 05:00.926
(jet engine whooshing)

05:15.440 --> 05:18.986
That's all the motivation I need
to actually do this.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.495
Did we finish fueling?

05:28.579 --> 05:30.914
Do you see the hose in the plane?
No.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.125
Well, then, I guess we're finished.
Thanks, George.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.711
You want to say that one more
time without the sarcasm?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.256
QUAGMIRE: Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.258
This is your captain,
Glenn Quagmire.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.260
Uh... we're looking at about

05:43.343 --> 05:45.137
a four-and-a-half-hour
flight time today.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.599
Uh... we've got clear skies,
good visibility.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.560
The temperature in Atlanta
is 64 degrees.

05:51.643 --> 05:55.272
Uh... the flight's going
to be a little longer

05:55.355 --> 05:56.815
than we've expected.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.318
Uh, we've got some very
strong headwinds... giggety.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.695
Uh, flight attendants,
please prepare for takeoff.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.492
(beeping)

06:07.576 --> 06:08.619
What the hell?!

06:10.579 --> 06:12.247
Oh, my God! We're going down!

06:12.331 --> 06:13.749
(all screaming)

06:16.126 --> 06:18.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Secure your own mask first,

06:18.879 --> 06:20.255
and then assist the child!

06:20.339 --> 06:21.840
But the bag's
not inflating!

06:21.924 --> 06:24.301
It's all right!
Even though oxygen is flowing,

06:24.384 --> 06:25.844
the bag may not inflate!

06:25.928 --> 06:28.180
(engines whooshing)

06:35.312 --> 06:37.689
(hissing)

06:37.773 --> 06:39.149
(sighs)

06:39.233 --> 06:40.776
That was too close.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.027
(chuckling)

06:42.110 --> 06:43.695
Sir, we have
a confirmed crash.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.239
Flight 37 is down.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.907
Well, we'd better
alert the mayor.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.909
I'll have to interrupt
his photo op.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.830
My Pet Goat. Page one.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.707
"'You know,' said my pet goat,

06:55.791 --> 06:58.919
"'I'm sure, if I watched
Grey's Anatomy, I'd like it,

06:59.002 --> 07:01.380
but I just
don't have the time.'"

07:01.463 --> 07:03.882
(whispering)

07:13.225 --> 07:16.270
"'You should make the time,'
said the farmer."

07:22.109 --> 07:23.235
Our top story:

07:23.318 --> 07:25.696
There was drama in the
skies of Quahog today,

07:25.779 --> 07:28.699
as a Trans National
767 was forced to make a crash-landing.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.075
That's right, Diane.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.327
As if the world weren't
already scary enough,

07:32.411 --> 07:35.414
it seems you can't even get
on a plane safely these days.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.916
Channel 5 has
the spectacular footage.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.339
Fortunately, no one was injured.

07:44.423 --> 07:45.757
However, using state-of-the-art

07:45.841 --> 07:47.342
Channel 5
computer technology,

07:47.426 --> 07:50.095
we'll show you how disastrous
it could have been.

07:50.179 --> 07:51.263
Here's how it would have looked

07:51.346 --> 07:53.473
if the plane had crashed
into a school.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.147
(children screaming)

08:00.230 --> 08:01.732
Now here's how
it would've looked

08:01.815 --> 08:04.234
if the plane had crashed
into a school for bunnies.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.741
(bunnies shrieking)

08:10.824 --> 08:12.075
Now here's how
it would've looked

08:12.159 --> 08:13.785
if the plane had crashed
into a school for bunnies

08:13.869 --> 08:15.871
but one passenger had survived,
gone home,

08:15.954 --> 08:18.081
and mercilessly beat his wife.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.545
(bunnies shrieking)

08:24.546 --> 08:26.089
I'm alive!

08:26.173 --> 08:27.758
But boy, am I angry!

08:27.841 --> 08:29.843
Someone's gonna have
to pay for this!

08:30.928 --> 08:33.472
(crying):
Why! Why!

08:33.555 --> 08:37.267
Is this because I
overcooked the roast?!

08:37.351 --> 08:39.937
Powerful stuff-- you'd
have to be made of stone

08:40.020 --> 08:41.438
not to feel saddened by that.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.066
Boy, Quagmire, I'm really
sorry they fired you.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.360
I feel like this is
partially my fault.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.529
No, Peter, it's perfectly
normal to siphon jet fuel

08:48.612 --> 08:51.240
from an active runway with the intention
of flying a pickup truck.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.826
Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble,
but my redneck days are over.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.454
No more crotch shots
of me getting out of a car.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.125
Well, what are you
gonna do now, Quagmire?

09:02.209 --> 09:04.753
Hey, it-it's all right.
I got enough in my savings

09:04.837 --> 09:07.339
until I find another job--
I'll be fine.

09:07.422 --> 09:10.676
(squeaky voices):
Three weeks later.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.388
(screams)

09:14.471 --> 09:15.681
Mom! Dad!

09:15.764 --> 09:17.349
There's somebody
in my tree house!

09:17.432 --> 09:20.143
Yeah, and there's an annoying little homo
screaming in my kitchen.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.479
Which one do you think
I'm more pissed about?

09:22.563 --> 09:23.730
I'll remind you

09:23.814 --> 09:25.440
that I was invited here!

09:25.524 --> 09:27.442
All right, who's up there?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.361
Oh, hey, Peter.
Hey, Lois.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.113
Glenn, what are you
doing up there?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.490
Oh, I kind of moved in,
if that's okay.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.742
No airline'll hire me
after the accident.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.619
I'm broke and jobless.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.454
Quagmire, you belong
in a tree.

09:39.538 --> 09:40.998
You're a nut.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.335
(laughing)

09:45.419 --> 09:47.045
What?!

09:47.129 --> 09:50.591
(continues laughing)

09:50.674 --> 09:52.926
Come on down, Quagmire--
you're staying with us.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.887
Oh, great--
this is gonna be worse

09:54.970 --> 09:57.181
than the time I lived
with Marlee Matlin.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.433
(flatulating repeatedly)
Hi, Stewie.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.019
Oh, come on, Marlee, I
know you can't hear them,

10:02.102 --> 10:05.147
but you got to feel those
things slapping out of there!

10:08.984 --> 10:11.111
Hey, listen, I really
want to thank you guys

10:11.195 --> 10:12.988
for taking me in
in my time of need.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.115
Aw, forget it, Quagmire--
it's the least we could do

10:15.199 --> 10:16.992
after what happened.
(phone rings)

10:18.619 --> 10:20.120
H-Hello?

10:20.204 --> 10:22.080
Oh, you must have
a wrong number.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.209
There's no one here by the name
of Longrod Von Hugendong.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.668
Uh-uh-uh-uh...

10:26.752 --> 10:28.921
(mumbling)

10:31.256 --> 10:33.175
Okay, now add 20.
Okay.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.719
Now multiply it by four.
Okay.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.096
And what do you got?
8,008.

10:38.180 --> 10:41.141
And what does 8,008 look
like on a calculator?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.186
Oh, "boob"!

10:44.269 --> 10:45.395
Boob! Yeah!

10:45.479 --> 10:47.439
All right! All right!
All right! Boob!

10:47.523 --> 10:49.316
What if we had
two calculators

10:49.399 --> 10:50.984
and we put them
next to each other?

10:51.068 --> 10:52.069
(gasps)

10:52.152 --> 10:53.987
Yes, yes, yes,

10:54.071 --> 10:55.697
find one, yes!

10:57.866 --> 11:00.786
(snoring softly)

11:08.669 --> 11:10.212
(brief snort)

11:10.295 --> 11:12.714
QUAGMIRE (whispers):
Didn't mean to wake ya.

11:17.553 --> 11:19.888
Peter, you and I need
to talk about Quagmire.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.266
He's been living with
us for over a month,

11:22.349 --> 11:23.851
and I-I think
it's enough now.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.937
Lois, I'm the whole reason
he lost his job and his house.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.439
Besides, I can't throw
my best friend out on the street

11:29.523 --> 11:31.316
like a prom night
Dumpster baby.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.445
Hey, what are you
doing out here?

11:35.529 --> 11:37.656
Don't you want to dance?
Sure!

11:38.657 --> 11:40.909

(song ends)

12:46.975 --> 12:49.478
Besides, Quagmire
doesn't even have a job.

12:49.561 --> 12:51.021
Well, you're gonna have
to help him find one,

12:51.104 --> 12:53.148
because I've had enough of
him living in this house.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.900
Eh, you're
overreacting, Lois.

12:54.983 --> 12:57.569
And you can't spell "overreacting"
without "ovary."

12:57.653 --> 13:00.781
'Cause you're a girl.
I'm not overreacting!

13:00.864 --> 13:02.991
Hey, uh, just an FYI,
really no reason

13:03.075 --> 13:04.868
to go into any greater
detail than this.

13:04.952 --> 13:09.623
Uh, Stewie should probably
never use this pacifier again.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.334
Okay, so I'll talk
to him tomorrow?

13:12.417 --> 13:13.585
(canned audience laughter)

13:13.669 --> 13:16.630
(upbeat sitcom music playing)

13:24.721 --> 13:26.890
So how's the
job hunt going?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.058
It's awful, Cleveland.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.102
Quagmire blew every gig
we got him.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.937
It's too bad.
I really liked that job

13:32.020 --> 13:33.730
working on the
Starship Enterprise.

13:35.107 --> 13:39.194
Dude, you got to introduce
me to that black chick.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.989
Guys, the only thing I know
how to do is fly a plane.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.949
That's what
I was born for.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.326
And I'll never be happy
unless I can do it again.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.161
Then that's the only answer.

13:48.245 --> 13:51.039
Somehow we've got to get
Quagmire his job back.

13:51.123 --> 13:54.126
Fellas, I think I have an idea.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.257
Okay, guys, let's go over
the plan one more time.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.926
Quagmire will pose
as an airline passenger

14:03.010 --> 14:04.845
on the 6:00 flight to New York.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.848
Then Joe and I will sneak into
the flight attendants' lounge

14:07.931 --> 14:10.350
while Cleveland distracts
the security personnel.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.602
(playing bluegrass tune)

14:11.685 --> 14:13.687
Once we have the uniforms
and credentials,

14:13.770 --> 14:16.064
Cleveland, Joe and I
will board the plane

14:16.148 --> 14:18.275
posing as flight attendants.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.736
Once we're in the air,
we drug the pilots.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.905
At which point,
Quagmire is forced

14:22.988 --> 14:26.033
to step in and land the plane
safely, making him a hero.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.493
Everybody clear?

14:28.577 --> 14:30.412
Boy, this sounds
like more trouble

14:30.495 --> 14:32.039
than a moose
on the interstate.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.586
Hey, can you
help me out?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.171
I'm trying to get
a couple of bucks

14:39.254 --> 14:40.255
for something to eat.

14:40.339 --> 14:41.423
What's "moose stuff"?

14:41.507 --> 14:43.050
Whatever you
want it to be.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.259
I could have
sex with you

14:44.343 --> 14:45.511
or I could just
stand over there

14:45.594 --> 14:46.595
and drink from the lake.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.847
And everything
in between.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.140
Get in.

14:55.187 --> 14:57.356
(plane engine humming)

14:57.439 --> 15:00.692
(dramatic music plays)

15:11.078 --> 15:13.664
All right, I'm gonna go bring
the pilots their coffee.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.124
Hang on to something, 'cause
this ride's about to get rougher

15:16.208 --> 15:18.794
than dating a hot girl
with a bad laugh.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.963
I really
like you, Sandy.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.965
I really like you,
too, Peter.

15:23.048 --> 15:26.134
Yeah? You like it
when I kiss you here?

15:26.218 --> 15:27.469
Yeah.

15:27.553 --> 15:28.929
How about here?

15:29.012 --> 15:32.641
(deep cackling)

15:32.724 --> 15:34.643
Oh, stop, I'm tick...

15:34.726 --> 15:37.271
(deep cackling)

15:38.397 --> 15:40.399
Ma'am, I hate
to be a nuisance,

15:40.482 --> 15:44.987
but your son stopped kicking
the back of my chair.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.446
Hmm...

15:46.530 --> 15:47.906
Thank you.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.537
(screaming)

15:53.620 --> 15:54.997
Oh, no!

15:55.080 --> 15:57.833
Both the pilots are unconscious,
and we're in a nosedive.

15:57.916 --> 16:01.170
If only there was someone
on board who could save us.

16:03.005 --> 16:07.593
I said if only there was someone
on board who could save us.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.804
Uh, Peter,
I don't see Quagmire.

16:10.888 --> 16:13.432
Oh, that was great.
Thanks.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.475
I know you have a
choice in airport sex,

16:15.559 --> 16:17.186
and I appreciate
your choosing Quagmire.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.354
Please exercise caution
when standing up,

16:19.438 --> 16:20.898
as the contents
of your panties

16:20.981 --> 16:22.149
may have shifted
during coitus.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.026
All right, I got
a plane to catch.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.360
Say, which gate
is flight 209?

16:25.444 --> 16:27.905
209? That flight left
half an hour ago.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.615
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

16:29.698 --> 16:30.866
That plane's
going down!

16:30.949 --> 16:31.950
My friends are
on that plane!

16:32.034 --> 16:33.035
They're all gonna die!

16:33.118 --> 16:34.453
What?! Oh, no!

16:34.536 --> 16:35.913
And that's not
the worst part.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.456
Here's the condom
I said I put on.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.916
(gasps)
(chuckling)

16:38.999 --> 16:40.918
Aren't I just the worst?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.044
Good evening,
I'm Tom Tucker.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.587
And I'm Diane Simmons.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.797
More trouble in the skies
over Quahog tonight,

16:45.881 --> 16:48.967
as a Trans National jet is
apparently out of control.

Channel 5 has this
exclusive recording

16:50.928 --> 16:52.888
of a Mayday communication
from the cockpit.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.964
Hey, there, son.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.048
Mind if I have a seat?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.591
Hugh Hefner?!

17:29.675 --> 17:31.552
You look like you got
something on your mind.

17:31.635 --> 17:33.303
Ah, who the hell
am I kidding?

17:33.387 --> 17:34.888
I don't deserve
to be a pilot.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.640
I've let everybody down.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.058
Did you do the best
you could?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.309
No. I was gonna,

17:39.393 --> 17:41.478
but I ended up
getting laid instead.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.939
That reminds me of a guy
you might've heard of.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.899
(poignant music plays)
John Holmes.

17:45.983 --> 17:48.193
Greatest porn star
who ever lived.

17:48.277 --> 17:49.987
You know what he once said?

17:50.070 --> 17:53.156
He said, "You know,
I've got a 13-inch member...

17:53.240 --> 17:57.619
and Glenn Quagmire is the best
damn pilot I've ever seen."

17:57.703 --> 17:59.079
John Holmes said that?

17:59.162 --> 18:00.539
You bet he did...

18:00.622 --> 18:03.959
right before he died a very
painful, AIDS-related death

18:04.042 --> 18:07.045
from having unprotected sex
with so many people.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.130
(stirring march playing)

18:08.213 --> 18:10.424
Excuse me, Hef.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.926

18:25.189 --> 18:27.065

this is happening!

18:30.611 --> 18:31.820
PETER:
Help us!

18:31.904 --> 18:32.988
(screaming)
Help!

18:33.071 --> 18:34.907
Men, we're doing
everything in our power

18:34.990 --> 18:36.116
to get you down.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.826
Stand aside, sir.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.119
I'll take it from here.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.495
Peter, this is Quagmire.

18:40.579 --> 18:42.289
Now I want you to listen
very carefully

18:42.372 --> 18:44.041
and do exactly as I tell you.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.751
Take a firm hold
of the throttle,

18:45.834 --> 18:48.086
and pull the red mixture knob
out slowly.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.088
Okay.
All right, now do you see a button

18:50.172 --> 18:51.798
that looks like
a drunken gay guy

18:51.882 --> 18:53.258
eyeing you from across the bar?

18:53.342 --> 18:54.801
Um...

18:54.885 --> 18:55.928
uh...

18:56.011 --> 18:57.137
yeah, I see it.

right above it.

is apparently talking
the plane down.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.273
Ollie Williams has
the story. Ollie?

19:08.357 --> 19:09.691
I'm at the wrong airport.

After this.

19:21.662 --> 19:24.456
QUAGMIRE: All right, Peter, slide
the red knob all the way out.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.416
And the second those wheels
touch the ground,

19:26.500 --> 19:27.960
you hit the emergency brake.

19:48.313 --> 19:50.065
Well, guess there's
nothing left to do

19:50.148 --> 19:52.150
but watch the end
of Last Holiday.

Yes, she did.

20:07.749 --> 20:08.792
No, she di-in't.

20:08.876 --> 20:09.960
Yes, she did, Peter!

20:10.043 --> 20:11.044
I just saw it!

20:11.128 --> 20:12.129
All right,
take it easy.

20:16.341 --> 20:19.094
Ah, Glenn, we are
so thrilled for you.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.637
Yeah, guess it didn't
take too much

20:20.721 --> 20:22.556
for you to get your job back,
now that you're a hero.

20:22.639 --> 20:24.141
Yeah, and I'm so happy for you,

raped in a federal prison

after I was arrested
for hijacking.

Well, I couldn't have
done it without you guys.

You put yourselves on the line
and you gave me my life back.
