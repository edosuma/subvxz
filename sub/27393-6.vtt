WEBVTT

00:12.846 --> 00:14.055
Any sign of Alexa yet?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.473
No, she's still upstairs.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.935
Ahh, poor thing. Her first breakup.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.104
She's gonna be upset,
so I made her comfort food.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.856
[Dave] Looks amazing, honey!

00:23.398 --> 00:26.693
Alexa might be sad,
but at least she'll be uncomfortably full.

00:27.944 --> 00:29.571
Waffles, bacon...

00:30.780 --> 00:31.823
and lasagna?

00:33.074 --> 00:34.451
[sniffles] This is for me.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.164
-Wow, this has been really hard on you!
-[sighs]

00:39.497 --> 00:41.416
You're usually such a rock for Alexa.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.462
Yeah, but her first breakup is regular
mom crying with her daughter stuff.

00:45.962 --> 00:49.299
You know, so when Alexa comes down,
she and I will have a good cry.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.552
And it'll be nice. And sad. [cries]

00:54.220 --> 00:56.806
Well, you look beautiful when you cry.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.475
Really? [sighs]

00:58.725 --> 00:59.768
Sure.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.896
I... I'm gonna miss Dylan.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.066
But, but I am definitely Team Alexa.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.194
Honey, we're her parents.
Of course we're Team Alexa.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.529
Yeah, but I'm the captain.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.991
When I talked to Dylan,
he was a wreck.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.578
I'd be a wreck
if Gwenny broke up with me.

01:18.661 --> 01:19.954
I guess I'm Team Lucas.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.960
Good morning. How's it going?

01:26.336 --> 01:28.129
[excitedly] Ooh, waffles!

01:28.254 --> 01:30.256
[somberly] Ooh... waffles.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.135
-Waffle?
-Oh, I'm too upset.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.431
Uh, when Alexa does come down,
I brought this for her.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.767
Oh, the sad sweater!

01:40.975 --> 01:42.644
I haven't seen that in a while.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.772
I brought Alexa the Halloween candy
that I don't want.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.484
Oh, wait a minute, Twizzlers?
You're not going anywhere.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.612
Oh, poor Alexa.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.699
I guess we're not going shopping
for dresses for her Sweet 16 today.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.702
I know she was really looking forward to
a girls' day out.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.788
I know I was.

02:03.790 --> 02:07.627
Me too, but who can enjoy dress shopping
after what happened?

02:07.877 --> 02:11.131
-Oh, hon.
-Oh, thanks. [sniffles]

02:11.297 --> 02:13.216
But this is not about me. [chuckles]

02:13.466 --> 02:15.135
[shouts] Dave, will you hug me or not?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.847
It's gonna be okay.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.183
We're all here for her.
No matter how bad it is.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.602
I mean, she could be in her room
all day.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.939
I wonder what she's thinking,
right now.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.235
She's wondering where the syrup is.

enough for you?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.481
Or do you need lasagna?

03:11.441 --> 03:14.402
No, thanks. Is there a hole in the table?

03:15.486 --> 03:17.113
Wow! There is.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.240
I like it. [chuckles]

03:24.662 --> 03:26.581
So, how... how are you doing?

03:26.998 --> 03:29.000
-I'm actually fine.
-Wait, what?

03:29.459 --> 03:33.338
I know. Last night I was upset, but
when I woke up this morning, I was fine.

03:33.838 --> 03:37.467
I was so worried about you.
You're sure you're not upset?

03:38.092 --> 03:39.177
I'm not.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.763
Okay, okay, well that's great! [chuckles]

03:42.180 --> 03:44.807
-Hey, when are we going dress shopping?
-You still wanna go?

03:44.891 --> 03:45.725
Yes!

03:45.850 --> 03:49.562
My Sweet 16 is only a couple months away.
I'm focusing on what's ahead.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.357
I won't let some breakup get in
the way of finding the perfect dress.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.443
Yes! We are going dress shopping.
[chuckles]

03:55.526 --> 03:57.820
Uh, but first, I should get out
of these pajamas.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.573
Guess you won't be needing this.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.243
Or this. [giggles]

04:05.703 --> 04:07.789
Honey, are you sure you're not upset?

04:08.498 --> 04:11.334
I guess, with everything I've been through
the past two years,

04:11.459 --> 04:13.127
a breakup is just a breakup.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.338
I'm okay, Mom. I mean it.

04:15.922 --> 04:16.756
Okay.

04:16.881 --> 04:20.969
All right. Well if you don't need to cry,
then I don't need to cry. [chuckles]

04:21.177 --> 04:22.512
I'm just gonna...

04:23.012 --> 04:24.639
look in the fridge for a moment.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.558
[knock on door]

04:32.355 --> 04:34.357
-Gwenny!
-Move! [sighs]

04:34.607 --> 04:37.527
Heartbroken bifflsis. [sighs]

04:38.987 --> 04:41.114
Last night must have been
so awful for you.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.658
It's one thing to break up, but...
at a party?

04:44.200 --> 04:47.412
-Yeah, no need to--
-And that costume... horrible.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.374
I mean, the breakup.
So devastating and unflattering.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.418
I mean the costume. [chuckles]

04:55.211 --> 04:57.547
-Lucas, can you take her somewhere?
-Gwenny, you wanna--

04:57.630 --> 04:59.215
Shh! The women are talking!

05:01.301 --> 05:03.636
I get it. Guys do dumb things.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.263
[scoffs] Been there.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.308
Most of the time they don't even know
what they did wrong,

05:08.474 --> 05:10.351
then they're all surprised
when you end it.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.315
I lost my appetite.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.072
Now, what dress says "Sweet 16"?

05:24.365 --> 05:27.535
This one says,
"Distant auntie with something to prove."

05:30.913 --> 05:32.915
Alexa is really acting okay.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.753
Well, that's how we Mendoza women roll.
We are strong! [chuckles]

05:37.628 --> 05:38.629
And full of it.

05:39.922 --> 05:42.300
On the way here
you claimed to have allergies.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.802
Thought there was an onion nearby,

05:45.094 --> 05:48.139
and I didn't hear the third excuse
because you dove into the bushes.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.932
I'm fine. Okay?

05:50.183 --> 05:51.059
Just like Alexa.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.479
It takes more than a breakup
from a sweet boy who...

05:55.021 --> 05:57.023
also brought flowers on my birthday...

05:57.732 --> 05:58.816
to bring us down.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.278
[quavers] I'm gonna go try on this tiara.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.367
This is turning out to be a nice day.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.702
-[Katie chuckles]
-This is a train wreck.

06:10.119 --> 06:10.953
Mom.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.123
Alexa is in denial about her feelings,
and it is not healthy.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.751
She doesn't deal with it,
it's all gonna blow up.

06:17.126 --> 06:19.670
Kaboom. That's all I'm gonna say.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.297
Hmm. Good.

06:21.547 --> 06:25.176
You are not helping matters
by encouraging Alexa to deny her feelings

06:25.259 --> 06:26.844
just because you want her to be okay.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.473
Yeah, yeah. I do want her to be okay.
And she is.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.100
She thinks she is.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.811
She's just tucked her sadness away.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.649
When she gets triggered, grab the Kleenex.
I'm telling you she's miserable.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.151
Hahaha! This place is fun!

06:42.527 --> 06:43.361
Kaboom.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.120
Since dress shopping didn't get canceled,

06:52.537 --> 06:55.123
looks like we can still play
the video game I picked up.

06:55.289 --> 06:56.749
[video game tone]

06:57.041 --> 06:58.209
"Flight Simulator"?

06:58.292 --> 07:00.711
But you're a real pilot,
you're gonna crush me.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.712
Not true.

07:02.046 --> 07:05.716
You play video games all day.
You can just as easily crush me.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.803
[giggles]

07:10.012 --> 07:11.806
Ah, I'm glad Alexa's okay.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.225
I thought today might get
pretty emotional.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.145
Yet here we are. [sighs]
Wheels up in three, two--

07:17.270 --> 07:18.896
I'm so emotional! [sighs]

07:20.731 --> 07:24.068
-We have to talk about Gwenny.
-Uh, right now?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.654
It's just...
[grunts] Ugh! Never mind.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.740
[Dave]
Could you "never mind" somewhere else?

07:31.826 --> 07:35.079
Ugh! I can't stop thinking
about what Gwenny said,

07:35.496 --> 07:38.583
about breaking up with guys who do
dumb things and don't know it.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.586
I do dumb things all day,
and I don't know it.

07:43.087 --> 07:43.963
Well, we know it.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.800
She could break up with me
at any moment.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.677
Dad, what do I do?

07:50.386 --> 07:54.140
[sighs] Well, for starters,
when she's here,

07:54.557 --> 07:55.766
don't talk to your dad.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.060
Dude, you are bringing the wisdom!

07:58.853 --> 08:01.105
Lucas, we should go
if we're gonna make the movie.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.941
I need an extra ten minutes
to Febreze our seats.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.697
-What?
-I'm breaking up with you.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.199
-What?
-Oh boy!

08:11.782 --> 08:13.117
Excuse me?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.786
-I'm breaking up with you.
-Seriously?

08:16.287 --> 08:19.624
I'm the after photo
at my dad's dental office. Your loss.

08:19.957 --> 08:20.833
[Gwenny huffs]

08:23.669 --> 08:24.795
What was that?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.048
That was me not getting broken up with.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.299
Team Lucas.

08:30.384 --> 08:33.221
[male voice on TV] Welcome to Singapore,
Captain. Perfect landing.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.723
I didn't know flying was so easy.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.016
[video game beeps]

08:39.810 --> 08:40.770
Oh, love it.

08:40.937 --> 08:41.771
It's perfect.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.899
I wish it were less pink
and didn't have this weird extra fabric.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.526
-It's terrible.
-I hate it.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.572
[''This Town'' by Niall Horan playing]

08:56.661 --> 08:58.704
[sighs] This is Alexa and Dylan's song.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.041
Oh. They danced to this
at the Winter formal.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.126
But that's old news.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.379
I'm gonna go check the meter.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.884
-[sighs] You know, this song was--
-A song? [chuckles]

09:12.301 --> 09:15.054
I don't hear a song! I... but I,

09:15.137 --> 09:17.932
you know, I love sharing happy time
with my best friend.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.394
[chuckles] Katie, I told you, I'm fine.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.396
Yeah, yeah, I know.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.107
You know, it was just a simple,
impulsive hug.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.901
I'm gonna try this one on.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.487
Hi!

09:33.030 --> 09:35.533
How's it going in here, huh?
Everybody okay?

09:35.658 --> 09:39.078
Did you see the free bottles of water,
Mom? [chuckles]

09:39.203 --> 09:40.580
-I already nabbed a bunch.
-Uh-huh.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.748
[sighs]

09:43.040 --> 09:45.543
Sorry about my mom.
She just doesn't know when to quit.

09:45.626 --> 09:46.460
[both sigh]

09:46.544 --> 09:47.378
You know...

09:48.713 --> 09:53.384
sometimes you have to take Sad Street
in order to get to Happy Town.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.427
Thanks, Jennifer,

09:54.510 --> 09:57.263
but I'm already hanging out
and doing just Fineville.

09:57.346 --> 10:00.141
Yeah. Doing just Fineville.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.101
Yeah. Population: two.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.769
Go find your own town, Mom.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.945
[male voice from video game]
Turn left heading 230, over.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.031
Roger that, tower. I'm coming...

10:16.198 --> 10:18.993
Fog. How is there suddenly fog?

10:19.201 --> 10:20.578
You're flying into Newfoundland.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.414
The North Atlantic Drift
must be coming up from the south.

10:25.374 --> 10:26.876
I know where I am, Jack.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.629
I've actually flown into Newfoundland
in real... [grunts] Whoa!

10:29.712 --> 10:31.213
-Head for left!
-I don't need help!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.299
[rapid beeping from video game]

10:34.008 --> 10:35.801
Dad, I made a big mistake!

10:35.885 --> 10:37.845
[grunts]
Urgh, why did I break up with Gwenny?

10:38.429 --> 10:39.347
[beeping stops]

10:39.430 --> 10:41.891
You quit the game
right before you crashed.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.059
My son needs me.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.898
What if she already found
somebody else,

10:48.981 --> 10:50.024
and is telling him

10:50.107 --> 10:52.652
that his shoes are stupid
and he smells like ham?

10:54.028 --> 10:56.572
-I'm going to get her back.
-Yeah, you should.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.366
[sighs] Big mistake.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.076
So sorry.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.663
You need to show her how you feel!
A text isn't enough.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.830
[notification tone]

11:04.914 --> 11:06.207
She says a text isn't enough.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.335
I wonder what she wants.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.380
Do something big
that shows how much she means to you.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.673
What does she like?

11:14.090 --> 11:18.761
Um, basketball, uh, abbreviating words...
herself.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.930
Uh, cooking.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.808
A cooking class!
I'll bake her something.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.478
[male voice from video game]
Another perfect landing, Captain.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.897
A courageous descent into Courchevel.

11:30.898 --> 11:31.816
Courchevel?

11:33.651 --> 11:34.902
You landed on a mountain?

11:36.195 --> 11:37.780
[excited] With zero visibility!

11:41.992 --> 11:44.161
Hmm. What about this one?

11:44.787 --> 11:46.831
Yas Queen! [chuckles]

11:48.582 --> 11:51.293
Sorry, I just...
I've always wanted to say that.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.294
How was it?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.004
A little embarrassing.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.091
I wonder where my mom went.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.428
I've had to be strong all day.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.556
So I appreciate being able to be
vulnerable with you.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.933
It's what I'm here for.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.561
He just was so great, you know?

12:08.686 --> 12:12.523
I can't help but think it was something
that I did. Or something I didn't do.

12:12.857 --> 12:17.653
No. You are a lovely, kind,
talkative woman.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.156
If your husband couldn't see that,
that is his loss.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.117
Oh, I was talking about my daughter
and her boyfriend.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.161
[choking up] Ex-boyfriend.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.247
Yeah.
I'm gonna take my lunch break.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.709
I thought you just came
from your lunch break!

12:32.877 --> 12:34.211
None of these are right.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.130
Trigger.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.802
Alexa, sweetie, uh, maybe it's not
the dresses that aren't turning out

12:41.886 --> 12:42.803
the way you hoped.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.807
Um, uh, what about this dress, Alexa?
[chuckles]

12:47.808 --> 12:48.934
It's a garment bag.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.479
But... I was talking to Alexa.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.899
You look so beautiful.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.359
Aww, thanks.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.612
Let's go look for jewelry.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.657
Well, I wish I could pull off that color.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.954
Um, okay. Alexa. I'm just gonna...

13:09.038 --> 13:10.456
run this up the old flagpole.

13:10.748 --> 13:11.957
Um... [clears throat]

13:12.166 --> 13:13.834
Feelings are like...

13:14.376 --> 13:16.086
fruit at the bottom of the yogurt.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.172
You have to stir up that fruit.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.466
Or else, one day,
when you finish the yogurt,

13:20.549 --> 13:24.970
all that's left is just a sad bottom
of Boysenberry globs.

13:26.931 --> 13:30.017
Or, yeah, you just eat plain yogurt.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.811
No stirring required.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.271
Something to think about.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.984
I know what your mom's trying to do.
But I'm not upset.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.778
Huh! What do you think of this one?

13:41.695 --> 13:44.490
[Alexa] Or, how about those?

13:44.865 --> 13:47.409
-[Lori] Those are, um...
-Wow! [chuckles]

13:47.660 --> 13:49.954
I know, right? Let's try 'em on.
It'll be hilarious.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.705
[employee clears throat]

13:52.164 --> 13:54.625
And something
we'll seriously consider buying.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.382
Ha-ha! Check it out, Jack.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.301
A real captain is about to show you
how it's done.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.470
Throttle back...

14:06.554 --> 14:07.680
[ cell-phone beeping]

14:09.390 --> 14:12.101
Oh no, Gwenny's gonna be here
in less than an hour!

14:12.476 --> 14:13.769
Dad, I need help!

14:13.853 --> 14:16.313
-Uh, in a minute.
-[trembles] Dad!

14:17.773 --> 14:19.358
I'm so close!

14:19.984 --> 14:21.193
Your son needs you.

14:25.155 --> 14:28.826
[male voice from video game]
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! [explosion]

14:36.959 --> 14:39.295
-What do you think of the cake?
-Impressive!

14:40.921 --> 14:42.256
Yet oddly unsettling.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.382
[knock on door]

14:44.049 --> 14:46.594
-That's her. How do I look?
-You look good.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.888
Thanks. Oh, can you change your shirt?

14:49.179 --> 14:51.432
-Answer the door.
-Grab the cake.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.021
-Hi, Gwenny.
-I just came by to drop these off.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.482
You printed out our selfies?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.276
I was gonna delete them from my phone,

15:02.401 --> 15:05.613
then I thought, tearing you out of
each one would feel more satisfying.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.530
It did.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.327
I don't want pictures without you.
Oh, maybe this one.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.329
-[Gwenny sighs]
-Oh. Don't go.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.581
Not until you've seen
what I've done for you.

15:19.668 --> 15:23.005
It's something to show you how sorry I am
for breaking up with you.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.929
Is... that me?

15:30.429 --> 15:31.764
[Lucas] It's your head.

15:31.847 --> 15:32.723
Unh-unh.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.351
I messed up and I shouldn't have said
those dumb things.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.645
You'll have to be more specific.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.774
I was so scared you'd break up with me,
I broke up with you first.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.401
-I'm sorry.
-You're scared of me?

15:45.402 --> 15:47.947
-No, I was scared that--
-No, I love that you're scared of me!

15:48.113 --> 15:50.032
-It was more about--
-Oh, boyfriend! [sighs]

15:50.115 --> 15:52.034
-I'm petrified.
-[Gwenny laughs]

15:52.868 --> 15:54.453
Wanna go take some new selfies?

15:54.536 --> 15:56.830
-Great idea! I'll bring the cake.
-No.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.710
Jack.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.796
What, you only fed me lunch!

16:07.883 --> 16:09.301
[Alexa] Okay, ready!

16:11.512 --> 16:13.889
-[all giggle]
-Wait.

16:14.223 --> 16:18.018
[Alexa chortles]
Mom, you look like a parade float!

16:18.185 --> 16:19.144
[laughter]

16:19.228 --> 16:21.355
You look like Grandma's
toilet paper cover.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.023
[laughter]

16:23.107 --> 16:25.109
Let's go see, let's go see.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.113
-[Alexa] Oh! Haha.
-[Lori] Oh!

16:29.196 --> 16:31.865
Don't make me laugh!
I had a lot of free waters.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.493
It's gonna take me 10 minutes
to get out of this dress.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.414
Okay, let's take a selfie
before your mom has to buy that dress.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.333
-Okay. Say...
-[Lori] Girls' day out!

16:41.458 --> 16:43.585
Okay, uh, I'm playing with fire.
Gotta go.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.171
[Alexa chuckles]

16:46.255 --> 16:49.800
Oh, it's even worse in a picture.
I've gotta text these to Dylan.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.680
Oh, right.
I guess I don't have to do that anymore.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.057
[music playing]

16:58.017 --> 16:59.601
Let's go try something else on.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.353
Wait.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.063
[sighs]

17:04.481 --> 17:06.650
You got to stop pretending you're okay.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.028
But I am okay.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.698
My mom is right.
You are never going to get past it...

17:13.323 --> 17:14.742
unless you feel it.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.079
I can't feel something I'm not feeling.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.664
[Alexa sighs]

17:20.789 --> 17:23.584
-Come on, let's go find you a tiara.
-No!

17:24.168 --> 17:27.379
Look, I know how much Dylan meant to you.

17:28.881 --> 17:33.093
How big you smiled
when he left notes in your locker.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.346
Or made that silly face
that you pretended to hate.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.725
Or how he always texted you,
"good night."

17:40.225 --> 17:41.351
[Alexa gulps]

17:42.186 --> 17:43.562
And now it's over.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.858
And there is no way that,
that does not hurt.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.444
[Katie sighs]

17:50.903 --> 17:52.905
[Alexa takes a deep breath]

17:54.073 --> 17:56.200
I need to get out of this dress. [sighs]

17:56.492 --> 17:57.367
[Katie scoffs]

17:59.203 --> 18:00.579
[huffs] Oh, come on.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.751
Stupid zipper, this is really annoying.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.961
[quavers] Let me help you.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.090
[yells] What is wrong with this stupid,
stupid zipper?

18:11.215 --> 18:13.217
[Alexa crying]

18:20.516 --> 18:21.475
Okay, okay.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.480
[Lory] It's okay, it's okay.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.861
I don't wanna be sad, Mom.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.031
I can't believe it's really over.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.367
Sweetie, I know.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.994
It's okay to be sad.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.080
[all whimpering]

18:47.501 --> 18:49.128
[crying] I knew I was right.

18:56.677 --> 19:00.013
Extra pillow.
Playlist of your favorite fail videos.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.306
Box of Kleenex.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.475
Backup box of Kleenex.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.687
Thanks, Katie.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.063
Tsk.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.817
Hey, I'm sorry I made you exit
onto Sad Street.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.282
Oh! Forgot the sad socks.

19:18.532 --> 19:19.449
Ugh.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.370
Hey.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.040
You know, you're going to be really mad
you missed dinner.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.543
Lucas dropped his chicken
through the hole.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.591
Honey. [sighs]

19:41.180 --> 19:43.140
How long am I going to feel like this?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.018
For a while.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.564
But then it's going to get better.
I promise.

19:53.066 --> 19:53.942
But you know...

19:55.777 --> 19:56.987
it makes me remember

19:57.070 --> 19:59.406
that you're one of the strongest people
I know.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.245
Anybody in here want some cake?

20:06.121 --> 20:07.206
No, thanks.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.666
This one's going to cheer you up.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.132
-Maybe I do want cake.
-[Dave chuckles]

20:18.550 --> 20:19.676
[sighs]

20:20.969 --> 20:22.012
We love you, kiddo.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.058
I love you guys too.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.229
[Lori inhales then clears throat]

20:30.979 --> 20:32.105
[forks clinking]

20:32.522 --> 20:35.108
Mmm, Gwenny's sweet! That's ironic.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.693
[Dave chuckles]

20:36.777 --> 20:39.363
Umm, can we turn her this way?

20:40.489 --> 20:43.825
Kind of having a hard time enjoying her
when she's looking at me.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.744
I don't mind it.
