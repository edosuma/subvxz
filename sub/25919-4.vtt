-[Pru] Morning, pals.
-Ka-blam!

01:04.563 --> 01:06.316
[Pru] Aah! Whoa!

01:06.983 --> 01:10.070
Congratulations, my intrepid explorers.

01:10.153 --> 01:14.282
After journeying hundreds
of millions of miles,

01:14.365 --> 01:17.786
we're all coming to the end
of a trip around the sun

01:17.869 --> 01:19.079
and the start of another.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.040
-Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
-[clamoring]

01:22.123 --> 01:25.126
Remember last year,
you wrote down a New Year's resolution?

01:25.210 --> 01:28.505
Well, I saved them,
and now we can open them up

01:28.588 --> 01:30.089
and see how you all did.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.175
[students grumbling]

01:32.258 --> 01:35.512
My resolution was not
to make a resolution.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.514
Why fix what ain't broke?

01:37.597 --> 01:41.309
But resolving not to make a resolution
is a resolution.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.312
Wait.

01:44.395 --> 01:45.939
My brains hurt.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.943
I think we were just supposed
to make one resolution.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.945
Guess I was feeling ambitious.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.948
My mom said I should express my feelings,

01:55.031 --> 01:57.117
and I guess I do have a lot to say,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.953
so my resolution was to write a haiku,

02:00.036 --> 02:03.289
and I did it, and maybe now
I'll be a poet when I grow up.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.668
"Inside, I have thoughts,
thoughts and some feelings also.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.627
Mom, I don't like beets."

02:10.045 --> 02:12.757
Oh. Thank you, Frank.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.138
My resolution was to say "yes" to life.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.765
And did I have a great year? Yes.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.143
Wait, what does saying "yes" even mean?

02:23.226 --> 02:26.771
Resolutions need to be clear goals.
How else would you know you did them?

02:26.855 --> 02:30.775
Well, I said "yes" to joining the circus
and delivering a baby horse

02:30.859 --> 02:32.610
and eating those berries from that bush,

02:32.694 --> 02:34.737
although I wish I had said "no"
to that one.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.157
You also said "yes"
to wearing that shirt today.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.159
Was that part of your resolution?

02:39.242 --> 02:41.411
Yes! Ooh, another one!

02:41.494 --> 02:42.370
[sighs]

02:42.453 --> 02:44.998
Pru, it seems like you have
strong thoughts on this subject.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.791
What was your resolution?

02:46.875 --> 02:50.420
I wanted to keep getting better at riding,
so I resolved to take gold in a show.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.588
On January second,

02:51.671 --> 02:55.717
Chica Linda and I competed
at the Penna Junior Classic, and we won!

02:55.800 --> 02:57.468
Resolution, check.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.139
What was yours, Lucky?

03:02.098 --> 03:04.517
I guess I couldn't pick
just one resolution,

03:04.601 --> 03:06.477
so I made a whole list.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.562
"Learn to cook,

03:07.645 --> 03:09.856
catch the sunset
from the top of Pioneer Peak,

03:09.939 --> 03:11.816
get in touch with my mom's heritage."

03:11.900 --> 03:13.818
There's all kinds of great things on here.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.029
Very admirable, Lucky.

03:16.112 --> 03:19.115
-Tell us what it was like to do them all.
-Uh...

03:19.198 --> 03:22.702
I guess I sort of forgot about my list
after I turned it in.

03:23.494 --> 03:27.040
And I'm sorry I did.
These resolutions are great.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.416
Fail her, Teacher!

03:28.499 --> 03:30.793
She gets an "F" for the whole year!

03:30.877 --> 03:32.629
Hey, the year isn't over yet!

03:32.712 --> 03:35.089
I still have plenty of time
to do my resolutions.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.341
Hmm...

03:36.424 --> 03:39.427
You know, these were just for fun,
so you don't need to--

03:39.510 --> 03:41.137
You're right, Miss Flores!

03:41.221 --> 03:43.640
I said I would do these things,
and I will!

03:43.723 --> 03:45.892
My word is my bond.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.477
I accept your challenge

03:47.560 --> 03:50.438
to accept the challenge
I set myself a year ago.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.440
Tomorrow is New Year's Eve,

03:52.523 --> 03:55.526
and by midnight,
all my resolutions will be complete.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.863
No way you can do all
of these in a day.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.074
Sure I can! It'll be a breeze.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.327
Most are just fun things I wanted
to remember to do.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.287
-[neighs]
-I already checked one off--

04:06.371 --> 04:08.456
"invent a new game."

04:08.539 --> 04:11.668
This is Apple... Grapple?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.461
Ten points to me!

04:13.544 --> 04:15.463
What about "learn to lose gracefully"?

04:15.546 --> 04:16.673
What does that mean?

04:16.755 --> 04:19.259
I don't know, but it's something
people should do.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.885
[Lucky] Ha! Sorry, Abigail.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.345
Minus five points.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.680
Aw.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.516
Some of these are pretty big.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.686
The trick to a good resolution is
to make it an achievable goal.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.688
Like "learn to cook."

04:31.771 --> 04:34.274
Maybe you just learn one specific recipe.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.193
-Yeah, that's a great idea!
-Of course.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.028
It's a good thing
you've got me here to help.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.823
-I'm an expert resolution keeper.
-[Abigail] Me too!

04:41.906 --> 04:44.284
I'll get a jump on my resolution
for this coming year--

04:44.367 --> 04:47.245
-to be more helpful.
-[Javier] ¡Amigas! ¿Están aquí?

04:50.164 --> 04:51.374
Hola, amigas.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.710
Javier! I didn't know
you were coming to town.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.128
I wanted to surprise you.

04:55.211 --> 04:59.757
-It is good to see you again.
-You too. Your leg looks good.

04:59.841 --> 05:00.967
[gasps]

05:01.050 --> 05:02.135
I mean healed.

05:02.218 --> 05:03.594
Not good.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.014
But you do look--

05:06.973 --> 05:09.142
-You're walking.
-Sí, thanks to you.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.519
Now I am the best rider around again.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.730
Oh, yeah? We'll see about that.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.940
-Let's go, pals.
-[Pru] Now?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.817
What about your resolutions?

05:17.900 --> 05:20.737
We have all day tomorrow.
We'll just knock 'em out then.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.156
Ooh! It'll be the best day ever.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.033
What a way to end the year.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.869
[Javier] I have another surprise.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.204
I am not in town just
for the New Year's party.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.748
The mayor asked me to lead the parade!

05:31.831 --> 05:33.333
-[girls gasp]
-Congratulations!

05:33.416 --> 05:34.542
-Wow.
-That's great!

05:34.625 --> 05:35.960
It is a great honor.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.462
It will be a charro dance.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.881
Hacheta and I have been working
for months on it.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.549
Mira esto.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.800
[Lucky] Whoo-hoo!

05:42.884 --> 05:44.969
-[Abigail] Awesome!
-[girls cheer]

05:45.053 --> 05:46.512
-[Pru] Yeah.
-[Lucky] Whoo!

05:46.596 --> 05:48.556
I thought last year's parade was great,

05:48.639 --> 05:50.975
except for when Snips swallowed
the drum major's whistle,

05:51.059 --> 05:53.061
but a horse dance sounds way better.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.687
It would be perfect...

05:54.771 --> 05:56.773
if only we had a few more riders.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.066
Qué lástima.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.901
Ooh, ooh, ooh! We can help you!

05:59.984 --> 06:02.236
Oh, you want to be in the parade?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.237
-[Pru] Of course!
-[Lucky] Yes!

06:03.321 --> 06:05.364
-[Abigail] Definitely!
-[Chica Linda neighs]

06:05.448 --> 06:08.785
¡Excelente!
Now the parade will be perfecto.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.787
I will come tomorrow
and teach you the steps.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.955
-Vamos.
-[Hacheta neighs]

06:13.039 --> 06:15.374
This is great. I'll finish my resolutions,

06:15.458 --> 06:17.794
then we'll celebrate with the parade
and the party.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.796
It really will be the best day ever.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.721
[cheering and laughing]

06:28.805 --> 06:30.681
I may be the best trick rider around,

06:30.765 --> 06:33.601
but you and Spirit
might just be the fastest.

06:33.684 --> 06:36.229
You hear that, Spirit? He admits it.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.730
-Hyah!
-¡Vamos!

06:37.814 --> 06:40.691
-[Lucky] Whoo-hoo!
-[Javier] Whoo! [laughs]

06:42.568 --> 06:44.904
I can't wait to do the parade tomorrow.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.949
Yes, it will be fun being together.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.036
Uh, but there is much practice
we must do first.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.037
Many steps.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.622
Muy complicado.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.959
Hey, I'm not afraid of hard work.
Let's do this!

06:58.042 --> 06:59.418
[laughs] Tomorrow.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.420
Dulces sueños, Fortuna.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.633
-[Javier grunts]
-Good night.

07:05.716 --> 07:07.802
-Hmm...

07:13.516 --> 07:14.851
You're still asleep?

07:15.518 --> 07:16.853
Come on, Lucky!

07:16.936 --> 07:18.563
-Time to wake up!
-[both gasp]

07:18.646 --> 07:22.275
Ugh, not again. I just got
the circus glitter out of my clothes.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.860
[Lucky giggles]

07:25.528 --> 07:27.613
Oh, you're up early.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.575
"Watch the sunrise." Check.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.452
And I know what I want to do next.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.162
"Go swimming with Spirit."

07:34.954 --> 07:38.291
[shivering] Come on, Spirit.
It'll be... fun.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.376

07:58.811 --> 08:01.314
[Lucky shivering]

08:01.397 --> 08:03.316
This is so great.

08:03.399 --> 08:05.443
J-just like I imagined.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.904
Only five more resolutions to go.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.655
[breathing heavily]

08:09.739 --> 08:11.449
-Aah!
-[chuffs]

08:11.532 --> 08:14.327

-[firework whistles, pops]

08:14.410 --> 08:15.912

08:15.995 --> 08:18.706
Jumping jackalopes! That was a good one.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.124
[laughs]

08:20.208 --> 08:23.127
Girls, wait till you see the show
we're cooking up for tonight.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.962
The sky's gonna be purple for a week!

08:25.046 --> 08:26.214
Ooh! Let me help you!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.341
Whoa, little lady. Now, don't touch those.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.468
Fireworks are for dads only.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.636
[laughs] Especially this one.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.638
Hey!

08:33.721 --> 08:37.015
-[Al] I called dibs on that one!
-[Jim laughs]

08:38.226 --> 08:41.354
[Pru] "Try every type of candy
in the General Store."

08:41.437 --> 08:43.523
See? That's a good, clear resolution.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.025
Good? It's wonderful!

08:46.108 --> 08:48.528
Lucky, I'd be honored
to help you eat it all.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.738
I always get the sarsaparilla stick.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.740
I thought it was time I branch out.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.998
[laughing]

09:07.255 --> 09:09.173
[Lucky] I appreciate
you playing with me, Turo.

09:09.257 --> 09:11.050
I know sometimes I can get competitive,

09:11.133 --> 09:13.886
but I've resolved to learn how
to lose gracefully.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.388
Good for you, Lucky.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.767
Oh, big mistake, buddy!

09:19.850 --> 09:21.561
Ha! Got you!

09:21.644 --> 09:24.021
Yes! Yeah! [laughs]

09:24.105 --> 09:26.691
Whoo! [laughs]

09:29.485 --> 09:32.989
Are you also working
on winning gracefully or...

09:33.072 --> 09:35.658
[laughs nervously] Try again?

09:38.494 --> 09:40.204
Mm...

09:40.288 --> 09:41.581
-[Lucky] Ugh!
-[yells]

09:41.664 --> 09:46.127
This isn't gonna work unless I lose, Turo,
so really focus, okay?

09:46.210 --> 09:48.212
U-um, l-let's see...

09:50.131 --> 09:51.549
Give me a minute.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.177
I'll give you 20.
Aunt Cora's waiting for me back home.

09:57.972 --> 10:02.018
Oh, I'm so pleased that you're taking
an interest in cooking, Lucky.

10:02.101 --> 10:06.439
You are about to enter a world
of culinary adventure!

10:06.522 --> 10:09.609
We'll start
with a traditional beef Wellington.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.235
[mouth full] Sounds good.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.404
[chewing loudly]

10:13.487 --> 10:14.614
Sorry. Caramel.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.033
Let's see. We'll need eggs...

10:17.116 --> 10:18.743
-Got it!
-flour...

10:18.826 --> 10:20.119
-Yes, ma'am.
-milk...

10:20.202 --> 10:21.871
-Here you go.
-beef, of course.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.497
-Sure!
-Hey.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.458
What if we learn a Mexican recipe?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.460
-Yum!
-That would cover cooking

10:27.543 --> 10:29.253
and getting in touch with my heritage.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.756
Now you're thinking
like an ace resolution keeper.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.508
Oh, here!

10:34.592 --> 10:35.801
Tamales.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.055
Hmm. We don't have any corn husks.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.640
That's okay! I'll go get some!

10:40.723 --> 10:41.641
And I'll help!

10:41.724 --> 10:44.477
There's no need
to make more work for yourself.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.855
We already have beef for beef Wellington.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.566
Come on, Aunt Cora, it'll be fun!

10:51.108 --> 10:53.486
[sighs] Well, hurry back, then.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.904
Tamales take time,

10:54.987 --> 10:57.365
and we all have to get ready
for the party tonight.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.159
Spirit's the fastest horse around.
Be back in a jiff.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.162
[mouth full] Thanks, Abigail!

11:06.082 --> 11:07.041
Ha.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.796
[gasps] Impossible!

11:11.879 --> 11:13.297
Try again, Turo.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.758
I can't lose gracefully if I don't lose.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.094
[sighs]

11:23.182 --> 11:24.892
Okay, I've got the corn!

11:24.975 --> 11:26.227
Let's get cooking!

11:26.310 --> 11:28.312
Ready for practice, Fortuna?

11:28.396 --> 11:29.563
Uh, yes!

11:29.647 --> 11:30.689
Of course.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.899
Practice.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.819
You are still wanting
to be in the parade. ¿Sí?

11:34.902 --> 11:36.195
Wouldn't miss it.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.534
And left, back, right,
and then we do this.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.411
-[Hacheta neighs]
-Down the line.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.996
[girls cheering]

11:46.080 --> 11:46.914
Your turn.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.586
-[girls giggling]
-[Lucky] Whoa!

11:52.670 --> 11:54.714
-[grunts]
-You will get it.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.758
You, uh, just need practice.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.927
Vamos. Let's try again.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.721
Lucky, I've been waiting for you.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.141
Do you want to cook these tamales or not?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.142
Be right there!

12:06.225 --> 12:09.562
Uh, sorry. I got to go take care of this.
I'll be right back.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.730
-Uh, but--
-Five minutes! That's it.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.983
Está bien, but if you want
to be in the parade,

12:14.066 --> 12:15.359
you really must practice.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.278
I do. I really do.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.573
And I will-- practice, I mean.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.991
[Cora] Lucky!

12:22.074 --> 12:23.909
Back in a minute, I promise.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.078
-[Abigail] Lucky, catch!
-Oh!

12:26.162 --> 12:27.997
Mmm. Is that raspberry?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.832
Not sure. Swallowed it whole.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.337
[grunting]

12:44.472 --> 12:46.724
[sighs]

12:47.266 --> 12:48.601
Ah, good.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.768
Now we can begin.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.270
Begin?

12:51.353 --> 12:53.230
Um, be right back!

12:53.314 --> 12:54.732
[door opens, slams]

12:57.276 --> 12:59.403
Fortuna, you are not leaving again?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.572
You really need to learn this with us.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.657
No time. But I got it.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.744
Left, right, left, back, left,
be right back!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.370
[sighs]

13:10.998 --> 13:11.832
[gasps]

13:14.502 --> 13:16.712
-Aunt Cora, I'm done!
-[Cora] Good.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.048
Now we can start on the pork.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.009
How can something so small
have so many steps?

13:29.058 --> 13:31.810
-[Pru] All right! We've got it.
-[Abigail] We're doing it!

13:31.894 --> 13:33.854
-[horses neigh]
-[Pru] Almost perfect.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.778
[sighs]

13:41.278 --> 13:42.363
The last piece.

13:42.446 --> 13:46.283
[groans, gulps]

13:46.367 --> 13:47.826
I did it.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.828
I tried every candy.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.497
-Hooray.
-[stomach grumbles]

13:51.580 --> 13:53.582
-[Pru] Try all the candy, check.
-[gasps]

13:54.124 --> 13:57.711
But I don't know if it was a good idea
to eat it all in one day.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.880
-Seemed so fun this morning.
-[stomach grumbles]

13:59.964 --> 14:02.383
It's a great idea!
Best idea anyone's ever had!

14:02.466 --> 14:04.677
I feel like a million bucks!
It must be all the helping!

14:04.760 --> 14:06.971
Come on,
let's run circles around the house!

14:07.054 --> 14:09.265
[laughs]

14:09.348 --> 14:13.227
At least it's another resolution down.
Only four more to go.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.729
And the tamales should be done by now.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.481
Great, so we have time to practice.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.150
-[Cora] Lucky Prescott!
-[gasps]

14:22.611 --> 14:24.280
[gasps] My tamales!

14:24.363 --> 14:25.489
What happened?

14:25.573 --> 14:28.701
Well, you let them burn, is what happened.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.828
Cooking requires focus.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.497
Perhaps you should've spent more time
in the kitchen

14:33.581 --> 14:35.583
instead of flitting about all day.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.211
I was just-- I have so much to do!

14:39.295 --> 14:41.130
And whose fault is that?

14:41.213 --> 14:44.258
-[door opens, closes]
-Lucky. You ready to go over the steps?

14:44.341 --> 14:47.636
Left, right, back,
and then rear up down the line...

14:47.720 --> 14:49.889
No time. I've got to start over.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.724
I should've finished all these already

14:51.807 --> 14:54.894
so I could go watch the sunset
over Pioneer Peak and be done!

14:54.977 --> 14:58.105
[sighs] But I still have plenty of time
before midnight.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.149
No problem. Let's do this.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.159
Is it...

15:10.242 --> 15:13.120
-It's perfect.
-[sighs]

15:13.203 --> 15:16.749
And now you get to enjoy
the best part of cooking--

15:16.832 --> 15:18.542
eating the fruits of your labor.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.920
Ugh, no, thank you.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.839
After all that candy,
I won't be hungry until next year.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.633
Well, that's a shame.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.135
You know, Lucky,

15:28.218 --> 15:32.348
burning the candle at both ends
just makes the light go out faster.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.349
Huh?

15:33.432 --> 15:36.352
You may have bitten off
more than you can chew today.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.938
Maybe, but I can't stop now.

15:39.021 --> 15:40.981
I'm so close to getting everything done!

15:41.065 --> 15:42.858
-I-I can't just quit!
-Hmm...

15:43.442 --> 15:45.778
I said I would do it, so I will.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.280
See? Just two resolutions to go,

15:48.364 --> 15:50.574
and I even have time
to practice my dance moves

15:50.658 --> 15:51.909
-for the parade--
-[Abigail] Come on, Lucky.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.870
-It's parade time!
-What? Already?

15:55.746 --> 15:58.374
[Lucky] But-- but I need more time.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.377
[Pru] Javier said we'd do
a run-through before the parade.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.045
[Abigail] Yeah, we'll be fine.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.134
[Lucky] Back, left. No, wait. Right?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.512
[sighs] Come on, Spirit. We've got this.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.974
I expect great things
for the parade, my boy.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.977
I want our fair citizens to be dazzled!

16:18.060 --> 16:21.230
"Why, the mayor is a visionary!"
they'll say.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.816
Sí, Señor Gutierrez.
I will not let you down.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.110
We're about to practice. I will show you.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.406
-[Javier] Line 'em up!
-Oh, boy.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.075
I hope you were paying
more attention than I was.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.912
[Javier] Ready? Uno, dos, tres.

16:36.996 --> 16:37.913
[Lucky] Oops.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.417
-[Lucky] Spirit, wrong way!
-[Abigail] Lucky, forward!

16:41.500 --> 16:43.293
-[Pru] This way.
-[Abigail] Forward!

16:44.461 --> 16:46.088
-[Lucky] Sorry!
-[Abigail] What is she doing?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.423
-Huh?
-[Pru] Watch where you're going.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.841
[Lucky] I'm so sorry.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.510
[Abigail] Lucky. Lucky!

16:51.593 --> 16:53.345
-[Abigail] Come over here!
-Aah!

16:53.429 --> 16:56.265
[Pru] Come on, this way.
Watch where you're going.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.434
-[horses neigh]
-[growls]

16:58.517 --> 16:59.393
Sorry.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.769
Ah, ah, whoa, wh--

17:00.853 --> 17:02.646
-[Abigail] Careful, Lucky.
-[Pru] Back up.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.272
No pusieron atención.

17:05.523 --> 17:06.900
[Lucky] Sorry!

17:07.483 --> 17:09.403
Uh... Ah...

17:09.486 --> 17:10.863
[Javier] Line 'em up!

17:12.906 --> 17:14.032
-[Abigail] Lucky...
-Aah!

17:20.914 --> 17:22.499
-[Abigail] Lucky!
-Aah!

17:22.583 --> 17:23.584
-Oof!
-Aah!

17:23.666 --> 17:24.960
-[gasps]
-[horses neighing]

17:25.044 --> 17:26.420
Oh, oh! Aah!

17:26.502 --> 17:28.422
-[Pru] Oh, the pies!
-[Abigail] Whoa!

17:29.089 --> 17:30.132
Whoa!

17:31.759 --> 17:33.552
[grunts, sighs]

17:33.635 --> 17:35.054
[both grunt]

17:35.137 --> 17:37.097
Uh, from the top?

17:37.181 --> 17:38.932
¡Es un desastre!

17:39.016 --> 17:39.892
Sorry.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.186
I swear, I meant to practice more.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.605
I was really busy
with these resolutions, and--

17:44.688 --> 17:47.066
If you did not have time,
you should have said this.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.818
The others, they are working very hard.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.196
-This was important to me, Fortuna.
-I know.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.198
I'm so sorry.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.158
[neighs]

17:56.992 --> 18:00.704
Listen, I--
I've got these resolutions to finish.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.790
Maybe I should just...

18:02.873 --> 18:04.374
skip the parade.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.461
[groans]

18:07.920 --> 18:09.463
I'm really sorry.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.635
Just two more resolutions left, boy.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.720
-Let's finish this.
-[chuffs]

18:19.223 --> 18:20.516
Lucky, where are you going?

18:20.599 --> 18:23.727
Spirit and I are gonna go watch the sunset
over Pioneer Peak.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.605
What about the parade?
You were so excited about it.

18:26.688 --> 18:30.109
The parade'll be great,
but I've got to finish my resolutions.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.693
I'm so close.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.445
Well, it's a shame you'll miss out.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.532
But I won't be missing out
on that perfect sunset!

18:36.615 --> 18:38.450
[sighs] Got to go.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.036
-Hyah!
-[Spirit neighs]

18:43.288 --> 18:45.624
Oh, daughters.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.752
[both chuckle]

18:48.836 --> 18:50.420
[Lucky] Here we go, Spirit.

18:50.879 --> 18:53.132
One sunset coming up.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.467
See? I knew I could do everything
in a day.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.427
[Spirit neighs]

18:57.511 --> 18:59.763
Well, not everything, I guess.

19:02.516 --> 19:05.769
But, uh, watching the sunset
is just as fun as a parade.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.020
And then I'll be done,

19:07.104 --> 19:10.357
and I can go to the party knowing
that I completed all my resolutions,

19:10.440 --> 19:12.276
and I'm a better, happier person.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.610
[neighs]

19:13.694 --> 19:14.903
[sighs] Come on.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.113
We've got to hurry.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.245
What?

19:23.704 --> 19:24.955
Wait! No!

19:26.456 --> 19:29.376
I-- I missed it.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.669
But...

19:30.752 --> 19:33.172
this was the last sunset of the year.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.591
I can't finish my resolutions.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.301
[neighs]

19:38.093 --> 19:40.679
And I messed up things with Javier.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.639
[sighs] It's over.

19:42.723 --> 19:43.682
[chuffs]

19:44.474 --> 19:46.268
[neighs]

19:51.440 --> 19:53.108
[sighs]

19:55.194 --> 19:58.822
But... I can still learn
to lose gracefully.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.657
-[neighs]
-Come on, Spirit!

20:00.741 --> 20:02.409
We've got to get to that New Year's party.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.619
[chuffs]

20:03.702 --> 20:05.162
[neighs]

20:05.913 --> 20:08.415
[Mayor] Ah, my fine constituents!

20:08.498 --> 20:12.085
Thank you, thank you for coming
to this wonderful occasion!

20:12.169 --> 20:14.171
Lovely to see you all.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.757
Think they're going to serve cake?
We should be eating cake.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.760
What's a celebration without cake?
I can't stop saying "cake."

20:19.843 --> 20:21.887
I think you've had enough sugar.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.639
Can I talk to you?

20:23.722 --> 20:24.723
Sure, Lucky.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.058
Is this about earlier?

20:26.141 --> 20:28.644
It's okay. I know you get riled up
when you play--

20:28.727 --> 20:29.895
Hey!

20:29.978 --> 20:32.439
I'm sorry I messed up your parade, Javier.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.775
Lucky, it is okay.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.735
I thought I had time
to do everything today--

20:36.818 --> 20:38.779
a whole year's worth of resolutions--

20:38.862 --> 20:42.199
and it'd be great, but I didn't,
and it wasn't great.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.451
I nearly froze,
I didn't get to eat my tamale,

20:44.534 --> 20:46.286
I won't be able to look
at candy for months.

20:46.370 --> 20:50.082
-And then I knocked you over, and--
-Lucky, está bien.

20:50.165 --> 20:53.043
But why did you not just tell me
you did not have time?

20:53.752 --> 20:55.963
Because I didn't want to disappoint you.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.048
Because...

20:58.924 --> 21:00.884
-[crowd] Ten...
-Because...

21:00.968 --> 21:03.470
I like you a lot.

21:03.553 --> 21:04.680
[crowd] seven...

21:04.763 --> 21:06.473
Fortuna...

21:06.556 --> 21:08.267
I like you, too.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.687
You are loca, but... I like you.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
[crowd] ...two... one!

21:13.981 --> 21:16.108
Happy New Year!

21:29.997 --> 21:31.707
Happy New Year.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.543
Happy New Year.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.796
[crowd cheering]

21:46.388 --> 21:49.933
[Lucky] Javier said the parade was a hit.
I'm sorry I missed seeing it.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.727
Yeah, we were great.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.520
Maybe you'll get to do it
with us next year.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.523
[gasps]
Maybe I'll get to lead it next year.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.735
I think I just figured out
my new New Year's resolution.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.321
Sorry you couldn't do
all your resolutions, Lucky.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.740
It's okay. Thanks for trying to help.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.075
I hope I didn't mess up
your resolution, too.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.201
Are you kidding?

22:08.285 --> 22:09.745
I didn't help you finish your list,

22:09.828 --> 22:12.331
but that gave you the courage
to tell Javier how you feel.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.750
So, in a way, I helped you do that!

22:14.833 --> 22:17.961
Well, I've already got
my new resolutions for this year.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.340
Wait. These are just
your old resolutions again.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.466
Exactly.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.761
But this year I'm going to do them right,
starting right now.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.929
Let's watch the sunset over Pioneer Peak.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.183
Sounds great,
except the sun isn't setting for hours.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.770
That's okay.
I've got 364 more days to do the rest.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.022
