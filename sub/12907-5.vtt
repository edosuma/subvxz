WEBVTT

00:01.732 --> 00:04.299
Jeremy and I have
really started talking about

00:04.334 --> 00:06.438
leaving the business and getting out.

00:06.438 --> 00:07.369
Really?

00:07.404 --> 00:08.670
Don't go running off with Jeremy

00:08.705 --> 00:10.524
because he's the only person who asked.

00:10.524 --> 00:11.706
Run away with me.

00:11.741 --> 00:13.475
I know, Rach, about Adam.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.109
How many times are you gonna
make me look like a fool

00:15.145 --> 00:16.645
in front of these people?

00:16.680 --> 00:17.912
- Oh, my God.
- Don't do it.

00:17.947 --> 00:19.681
That's, uh... That's Hot Rachel.

00:19.716 --> 00:21.649
- So, this is the party truck, huh?
- You found it.

00:21.684 --> 00:23.384
Why don't you give me a tour?

00:23.419 --> 00:25.586
This season, our
suitor is more well-known.

00:25.621 --> 00:28.422
Ladies, are you ready? Darius Beck!

00:28.457 --> 00:30.991
Oh, my God. You like him.

00:31.026 --> 00:33.260
I went on a paleolithic
lifestyle retreat.

00:33.296 --> 00:35.492
And, uh, this show is my kingdom.

00:35.492 --> 00:37.030
"Everlasting" was my idea.

00:37.066 --> 00:38.065
Who's in charge here?

00:38.100 --> 00:39.432
- I am.
- I am.

00:39.467 --> 00:41.267
My two bosses are at
each other's throats.

00:41.303 --> 00:42.602
Coleman Wasserman.

00:42.637 --> 00:44.337
He is the one in charge now.

00:44.372 --> 00:47.607
You gave me the showrunner job
and essentially took it away.

00:47.642 --> 00:49.242
So you stabbed me in the back.

00:49.277 --> 00:50.743
Between you and me, we can make shows

00:50.778 --> 00:51.911
that actually mean something.

00:52.947 --> 00:54.214
You're the love of my life.

00:54.249 --> 00:56.047
I have a baby now. I'm responsible now.

00:56.083 --> 00:57.449
You're under arrest for kidnapping

00:57.484 --> 00:59.184
and child endangerment.

01:04.891 --> 01:07.092
Okay, what part about, "Let
me out before we get here"

01:07.127 --> 01:08.727
did you have a hard time understanding?

01:08.762 --> 01:10.229
What? You don't want to drive
to work with the boss

01:10.264 --> 01:12.263
in his new, totally unearned,

01:12.298 --> 01:14.699
utterly gauche, and
offensive British sports car?

01:14.734 --> 01:16.536
- No, I didn't.
- Hey, come on.

01:16.536 --> 01:17.768
We run the mother ship of this network.

01:17.803 --> 01:19.403
I'm saying you got to own it.

01:19.439 --> 01:20.438
Stake your flag.

01:22.174 --> 01:23.241
Don't do this again.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.785 --> 01:35.652
Riding to work with the boss.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.293
Only four episodes deep.

01:38.293 --> 01:39.651
Oh, Rach, I think you got

01:39.651 --> 01:41.221
a little bit of Quinn on your shoe.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.095
Okay, I was running the show for Quinn.

01:47.130 --> 01:48.464
I'm running it for Coleman.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.548
Goldberg, you're sleeping
with the showrunner.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.632
Own it.

01:51.668 --> 01:53.401
Oh, my God.

01:53.437 --> 01:55.704
Babe, did you actually
shoot this with a gun?

01:55.704 --> 01:57.158
This is hilarious.

01:57.263 --> 01:58.740
You're sleeping with a contestant.

01:58.741 --> 02:00.595
And you could get kicked off for
this, by the way, young lady.

02:00.595 --> 02:01.090
Right.

02:01.090 --> 02:03.431
After you slept with the
suitor all last season?

02:03.780 --> 02:05.712
You did what?

02:05.747 --> 02:07.414
What's behind your back?

02:07.450 --> 02:08.824
Should I come take a look at it?

02:08.824 --> 02:11.151
I think I should. Let me see it.

02:11.187 --> 02:13.520
Hand it to me right now.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.025
Ah.

02:19.061 --> 02:21.794
Yep, right through my eye. That's nice.

02:21.829 --> 02:23.696
Okay. Go. Hair and makeup.

02:23.731 --> 02:24.386
Skedaddle.

02:24.386 --> 02:26.556
See you later, sweetie. Go ahead.

02:31.872 --> 02:33.193
This is wrong, okay?

02:33.193 --> 02:35.879
I'm not a 19-year-old Instagram bimbo.

02:35.879 --> 02:38.247
I am a boss. This is not what it...

02:40.181 --> 02:41.880
My God.

02:41.916 --> 02:43.048
You are a vision.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.184
And you're back.

02:45.219 --> 02:47.552
- Who bailed you out?
- Oh. Jeremy.

02:47.587 --> 02:50.255
Oh. Well, he clearly knows
where his bread is buttered.

02:50.291 --> 02:51.356
How was jail?

02:55.028 --> 02:57.361
Uh, it was hard, really hard.

02:57.396 --> 03:01.899
A lot of drunks, losers...
a lot of puke.

03:01.935 --> 03:04.668
Those are your people,
Chet, so get used to it.

03:06.372 --> 03:09.073
Um, I just wanted to say...

03:09.108 --> 03:10.741
What? You want to apologize?

03:10.776 --> 03:12.108
Beg for my forgiveness?

03:12.144 --> 03:15.045
Commit hari-kari on my rug? Go for it.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.247
I-I wanted to say that...

03:17.282 --> 03:19.615
That everything I said
before the cops came...

03:19.651 --> 03:21.184
That was... that was the truth.

03:21.220 --> 03:22.719
Well, other than the whole
"I stole my baby" thing?

03:22.754 --> 03:23.720
Yeah. Other than that.

03:24.574 --> 03:25.239
Take it off.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.260
I meant it, Quinn.

03:27.912 --> 03:29.243
You're the love of my life.

03:29.279 --> 03:30.745
Chet, stop.

03:30.781 --> 03:32.714
You're embarrassing yourself, okay?

03:32.749 --> 03:34.849
If you haven't noticed, I'm busy.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.617
I have the Impact Awards tonight, okay?

03:36.653 --> 03:39.453
I'm gonna corner John Booth,
and I'm going to produce him

03:39.489 --> 03:43.224
into letting me run one of his networks.

03:43.259 --> 03:45.193
Quinn TV.

03:45.228 --> 03:46.560
Please. John Booth.

03:46.595 --> 03:48.128
Why is it that everybody who makes

03:48.164 --> 03:49.963
a billion dollars in some other industry

03:49.999 --> 03:51.098
thinks they can run ours?

03:51.133 --> 03:52.265
He's a douche.

03:52.301 --> 03:53.701
Well, he could be.

03:53.736 --> 03:57.104
On the plus side, he's not you, Chet.

03:57.139 --> 04:00.808
And, uh, that's the
best thing about him.

04:00.843 --> 04:02.576
Ugh.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.149
Take it off.

04:10.185 --> 04:13.219
Come on, America. It's sexy time.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.987
It is your chance to
be a part of the action

04:15.023 --> 04:16.822
here on "Everlasting."

04:16.858 --> 04:20.158
Now, tonight, Darius is gonna
take things to the next level

04:20.194 --> 04:23.595
with one lucky lady
who you get to choose.

04:23.630 --> 04:24.930
Of course, we'll be
tabulating your votes

04:24.965 --> 04:26.497
as they come in throughout the show.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.166
Call, text, tweet,

04:28.202 --> 04:30.301
Snapchat, if you will, your votes

04:30.337 --> 04:33.004
for the first overnight
date of the season.

04:33.040 --> 04:37.808
And remember... America, it's
time for your voice to be heard.

04:42.014 --> 04:43.114
Oh, that's garbage.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.882
Jay, what is that crap?

04:44.917 --> 04:47.184
I mean, come on. I wanted
Perrier-Jouet or above.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.652
This is... And that's a cut.

04:50.022 --> 04:52.489
Mm.

04:52.524 --> 04:54.023
I didn't think you'd be in here.

04:54.059 --> 04:55.458
I kind of like this bunking together.

04:55.493 --> 04:58.128
If you want me to find
somewhere else to work...

04:58.163 --> 05:00.296
What is that?

05:00.331 --> 05:01.397
Oh, nothing.

05:01.432 --> 05:03.733
What is this? Not nothing.

05:03.769 --> 05:05.468
Holy shit, Rachel.

05:06.704 --> 05:08.238
Where did you find this?

05:08.273 --> 05:10.306
I found that in the camera truck.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.741
In the camera... Jeremy?

05:12.777 --> 05:15.410
That's a fire-able offense right there.

05:15.445 --> 05:18.914
You can't fire him because
he's good, and he's very fast.

05:18.949 --> 05:21.416
Did you guys have a thing toge...

05:21.451 --> 05:24.052
I'm not judging you, but
this is cr... I mean...

05:25.856 --> 05:28.722
On a happier note,

05:28.758 --> 05:30.057
you're gonna need a ball gown,

05:30.093 --> 05:31.725
and we're leaving work at 6:00 tonight.

05:31.761 --> 05:34.495
The Impact Awards. That's Quinn's thing.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.397
It's our thing.
Tickets go to the showrunner.

05:37.934 --> 05:39.500
I can't. It feels weird.

05:39.535 --> 05:40.835
More like great and overdue, right?

05:40.870 --> 05:42.270
Do you know who else is gonna be there?

05:42.305 --> 05:43.504
Who?

05:43.539 --> 05:45.105
The rest of television,

05:45.140 --> 05:48.074
everyone we're ever gonna want
to work with in our careers.

05:48.110 --> 05:50.510
It's a great opportunity, Rach.

05:50.545 --> 05:51.611
Let's take it.

05:54.116 --> 05:56.783
Welcome back to "Everlasting."

05:56.819 --> 05:58.384
We're at the midway point of the season,

05:58.420 --> 06:00.086
only seven ladies left.

06:00.122 --> 06:04.790
But we have narrowed it down
to your two fan favorites.

06:04.826 --> 06:06.692
Now, of course, Darius
will share a drink with each

06:06.727 --> 06:10.229
and then choose one with
whom he will spend the night.

06:10.264 --> 06:13.432
We have tallied your
millions of votes, America,

06:13.467 --> 06:15.367
and the winners are...

06:18.405 --> 06:19.938
Yael and Dominique.

06:19.973 --> 06:21.206
Oh!

06:25.511 --> 06:26.945
This is so good!

06:28.414 --> 06:29.747
Thank you.

06:29.782 --> 06:32.050
Oh, wow. Ah!

06:32.085 --> 06:34.052
Where are these people?

06:35.521 --> 06:37.287
What do you want, Rachel?

06:37.323 --> 06:39.656
You're trying to sell Yael and Dominique

06:39.691 --> 06:40.924
as the fan favorites?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.625
Well, yeah, anything's possible

06:42.661 --> 06:45.595
since we don't actually
tally those votes.

06:45.630 --> 06:48.465
I mean, I don't even really know
where that phone number goes.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.267
Okay, but, like, why Dominique?

06:50.302 --> 06:53.135
So Hot Rachel gets the overnight.

06:53.171 --> 06:55.271
I mean, if I gave
Darius an actual choice,

06:55.306 --> 06:57.139
then I wouldn't get what I want.

06:57.175 --> 06:59.008
Okay, well, Darius wants Ruby, FYI.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.777
Of course he does. Madison!

07:01.812 --> 07:04.981
Why are we doing overnights
before the final two?

07:05.016 --> 07:06.682
Uh, because I felt that the show needed

07:06.717 --> 07:08.150
a little more spice...

07:08.186 --> 07:11.452
unless you and Coleman
have a different idea.

07:11.488 --> 07:13.188
Maybe you want to give me some notes?

07:15.558 --> 07:17.025
Where's my stylist?

07:17.060 --> 07:18.459
I don't know.

07:18.495 --> 07:19.961
And where are the Impact tickets?

07:19.997 --> 07:22.430
- I don't have them.
- Well, go get them.

07:22.465 --> 07:23.798
I can't.

07:23.833 --> 07:26.234
- Madison...
- No, actually, she can't.

07:27.569 --> 07:29.169
And why is that?

07:29.205 --> 07:30.337
Because I have them.

07:30.373 --> 07:32.172
See, they're for the showrunner,

07:32.208 --> 07:34.474
and Coleman's the showrunner, so...

07:36.145 --> 07:37.144
Get out.

07:41.583 --> 07:42.917
- Quinn
- Out!

07:48.987 --> 07:51.155
Yeah, that's perfect. That's good.

07:51.190 --> 07:53.224
Hey, Jeremy, you got a second?

07:53.259 --> 07:54.069
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's up?

07:54.069 --> 07:56.492
- Guys, could you give us a minute?
- Yeah, you bet.

07:56.527 --> 07:58.361
Um, so, I got some
feedback from the network

07:58.396 --> 07:59.174
about our look this year,

07:59.198 --> 08:00.564
- and they have some concerns.
- Really?

08:00.565 --> 08:01.260
Well, what did they say?

08:01.260 --> 08:02.244
Well, they used words

08:02.244 --> 08:05.735
like "flat," "undynamic,"
"not evolving."

08:05.771 --> 08:07.737
What does that even mean?

08:07.773 --> 08:10.039
Did they mention specific
episodes or scenes or anything?

08:10.075 --> 08:12.690
No, nothing specific. More
of a global discussion.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.076
Anyway, I'm gonna bring
on a visual consultant

08:14.111 --> 08:15.878
to kind of course-correct
the department.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.913
- A visual consultant.
- Mm-hmm.

08:17.948 --> 08:22.151
That sounds... That sounds
a lot like a new D.P.

08:22.186 --> 08:22.820
Am I getting fired?

08:22.820 --> 08:25.220
Absolutely not.

08:25.256 --> 08:27.256
In the meantime, though,
for a little while at least,

08:27.291 --> 08:29.023
I'm gonna have you
move to the insert unit.

08:29.058 --> 08:30.401
The...

08:30.401 --> 08:32.726
I started on the insert unit.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.397
Rachel put you up to this?

08:36.432 --> 08:39.500
My relationship with Rachel
is none of your business.

08:39.534 --> 08:41.735
Well, maybe I should quit.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.038
Yeah, well, you always
have that option, don't you?

08:47.876 --> 08:49.776
Hey.

08:49.812 --> 08:51.938
- You look great.
- Hi.

08:51.938 --> 08:54.028
Um, are you sure about this dress?

08:54.028 --> 08:55.048
It's not too revealing?

08:55.048 --> 08:55.948
I don't think so.

08:55.948 --> 08:57.449
I mean, this is the first overnight.

08:57.449 --> 09:01.271
It's a really big deal, and...
your competition...

09:02.156 --> 09:03.956
Uh, yeah, that's kind of
what I'm talking about.

09:03.991 --> 09:05.590
I don't want Darius to think
I'm trying too hard.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.526
Okay, well, you better try something.

09:07.561 --> 09:09.094
What are you talking about?

09:09.130 --> 09:10.462
They voted for me.

09:10.497 --> 09:12.064
Right.

09:12.099 --> 09:13.532
Yeah, well, tonight's about Darius,

09:13.567 --> 09:15.567
and, honestly, the
guy hasn't noticed you.

09:15.602 --> 09:17.303
What? I'm a basketball player.

09:17.338 --> 09:18.737
I'm a foot taller than everyone.

09:18.772 --> 09:21.072
For better or for worse,
Yael made herself known,

09:21.107 --> 09:23.041
so if you really want to stick around...

09:23.076 --> 09:25.409
What should I do?

09:31.617 --> 09:33.784
America has done the difficult work

09:33.820 --> 09:37.221
and narrowed the field
down to Yael and Dominique.

09:37.256 --> 09:39.923
So, what do you say, Darius?

09:39.959 --> 09:41.424
Thank you, America.

09:41.460 --> 09:42.726
Now, obviously,

09:42.761 --> 09:44.594
the final decision is yours, of course,

09:44.629 --> 09:47.797
but to help you, we have
asked Yael and Dominique

09:47.833 --> 09:50.667
to come up with their
very own specialty drink

09:50.702 --> 09:52.302
to give you a little
insight on what an evening

09:52.338 --> 09:54.070
with each one of these
beauties might have in store.

09:54.105 --> 09:55.804
It should be Ruby, and you know it,

09:55.840 --> 09:57.173
after last's week's, like,

09:57.208 --> 09:59.308
beautiful, Nubian
lovefest that I captured.

09:59.344 --> 09:59.961
- Jay...
- No.

09:59.985 --> 10:01.979
You brought her
here for the wrong reasons.

10:01.980 --> 10:04.254
Rach, you thought she'd be gone
in two episodes, but guess what?

10:04.515 --> 10:07.150
What's happening between them is real,

10:07.185 --> 10:09.818
and that in itself is a
beautiful story worth telling.

10:09.853 --> 10:11.753
Okay. So maybe it'll be her.

10:11.789 --> 10:13.121
- How?
- Will you stop?

10:13.157 --> 10:15.057
Seriously, shut up.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.758
Have some faith.

10:16.794 --> 10:20.162
A splash of lime juice, just
a kiss of orange blossom,

10:20.197 --> 10:21.897
three ounces of Cuervo.

10:21.932 --> 10:23.665
There it is...

10:23.701 --> 10:25.266
with raspberries and mint.

10:25.302 --> 10:27.902
I mean, she really is
sex on a stick, isn't she?

10:27.937 --> 10:29.503
- Not bad.

10:29.538 --> 10:31.772
I call it an Uncharted Depth...

10:31.808 --> 10:33.240
Uncharted Depth.

10:33.275 --> 10:35.409
A drink which reveals itself over time.

10:35.444 --> 10:36.510
I'm that way, too.

10:36.545 --> 10:38.079
People often get

10:38.114 --> 10:39.580
the wrong impression
'cause of the way I look,

10:39.615 --> 10:40.981
but I never spend the night with someone

10:41.017 --> 10:42.316
unless I'm truly serious about them.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.283
"America, welcome to my boobs."

10:44.319 --> 10:45.383
- Dominique.
- I don't have

10:45.407 --> 10:47.221
a fancy cocktail for you

10:47.222 --> 10:49.455
because I'm all about
honesty, integrity,

10:49.490 --> 10:51.091
and knowing what you're gonna get.

10:51.126 --> 10:54.127
Ugh! In other words,
a snoozefest in bed.

10:54.162 --> 10:55.695
She looks like a magician.

10:55.731 --> 10:58.965
Simple glass of red wine...
and the truth.

11:00.668 --> 11:02.935
If you're gonna be spending
the night with one of us,

11:02.970 --> 11:04.336
it should probably be the one

11:04.371 --> 11:05.971
who's not sleeping with the crew.

11:06.006 --> 11:08.807
What? What? Wait.

11:08.843 --> 11:10.342
What did she just say? Um...

11:10.377 --> 11:11.710
Excuse me?

11:11.746 --> 11:12.945
- Are you saying she...
- Darius.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.279
You deserve someone who's here

11:14.314 --> 11:15.547
just for you, Darius.

11:15.582 --> 11:16.782
I am here for him.

11:16.817 --> 11:18.315
You got a funny way of showing it.

11:18.351 --> 11:19.784
- Don't listen to this.
- She lied to your face.

11:19.819 --> 11:21.185
- Are you kidding me?
- She's been lying to you.

11:21.221 --> 11:22.787
- Quit this.
- How do you get the nerve...

11:26.926 --> 11:29.360
Jeremy, what are you doing?

11:29.395 --> 11:30.628
What, are you drunk?

11:30.663 --> 11:32.130
Getting there.

11:32.165 --> 11:33.397
This prick demoted me,

11:33.432 --> 11:35.431
so I'm filing a formal complaint.

11:36.701 --> 11:38.068
I'm not sure that's the protocol.

11:38.103 --> 11:40.336
I'm not going back to insert unit, Chet.

11:40.372 --> 11:42.705
I'm not starting over.
It's been five years.

11:42.741 --> 11:44.707
I think I have a way to help us both.

11:44.743 --> 11:46.209
Really?

11:46.245 --> 11:48.344
Did you talk to the
network or talk to him or...

11:48.380 --> 11:50.546
No, no. No more shortcuts. Follow me.

11:52.884 --> 11:55.384
I'd be lying if I
said I wasn't disappointed.

11:55.419 --> 11:57.653
Yael, I was really looking forward

11:57.688 --> 12:00.189
to getting a chance to know
you a little better tonight.

12:00.224 --> 12:03.893
But considering what
I've just learned...

12:03.928 --> 12:05.928
I'm pretty sure my
heart wouldn't be in it.

12:05.963 --> 12:07.930
Can I just say, in my defense...

12:07.965 --> 12:10.298
I'm afraid Darius'
decision is final, Yael.

12:13.369 --> 12:15.336
Dominique, I'm sorry,

12:15.371 --> 12:17.071
but it's not going to be you, either.

12:17.107 --> 12:18.873
While I value monogamy and trust,

12:18.909 --> 12:21.709
I'm a big fan of
discretion and fair play,

12:21.744 --> 12:23.744
and you showed neither of those today.

12:23.780 --> 12:26.613
Who the hell is Hot
Rachel sleeping with?

12:26.648 --> 12:29.416
That said, it would be a shame

12:29.451 --> 12:31.251
to let the dream suite go to waste.

12:31.287 --> 12:35.122
I hope America won't mind
if I pick a wild card.

12:35.157 --> 12:37.357
I hate it when they go rogue.

12:37.392 --> 12:39.626
Okay.

12:39.661 --> 12:42.262
Okay, there you go. Yeah. Yeah.

12:42.298 --> 12:44.063
Stop there.

12:44.098 --> 12:46.199
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

12:46.234 --> 12:48.400
- Don't pick her.
- Ruby...

12:48.436 --> 12:49.768
No. Unh-unh.

12:49.804 --> 12:51.370
Do you have plans this evening?

12:51.405 --> 12:53.372
No! No, no, no. Okay,
this is not happening.

12:53.407 --> 12:56.408
Madison, go get Rachel.
Bring her here right now. Go.

12:56.444 --> 12:58.544
No, Madison, don't worry about Rachel.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.214
Hey, uh, could you guys...

13:02.249 --> 13:03.548
Could you guys step outside for one sec?

13:03.583 --> 13:04.950
Everyone, Madison.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.757
Thank you.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.759
Can you put these ladies to bed?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.828
Bitch, please. In my sleep.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.097
I'm going to a gala.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.166
Have fun, Cinderella.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.935
A Darius/Ruby overnight?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.503
I mean, please tell me

13:26.538 --> 13:29.473
that you're the dumb-dumb
who made that happen.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.508
That was all Rachel.

13:31.543 --> 13:33.477
- It was a good idea, too.
- Yeah, okay.

13:33.512 --> 13:34.744
Look, I get that you're upset.

13:34.779 --> 13:35.979
Why don't you go home?

13:36.014 --> 13:37.947
Just take a couple of days, like a week.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.682
You've suffered a loss.

13:39.717 --> 13:43.253
If you had met my father,
you wouldn't call it a loss.

13:43.288 --> 13:44.921
I'm not talking about your father.

13:44.956 --> 13:46.489
She outgrew you.

13:49.227 --> 13:50.459
It happens.

13:50.495 --> 13:52.094
You had to know it eventually would.

13:52.129 --> 13:53.695
You know what? You can just
get out of my control room.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.999
You're pulling all of this
crap just to mess with Rachel.

13:57.034 --> 13:58.934
Be bigger than that. Trust me.

13:58.969 --> 14:00.335
You're gonna get your show
back at the end of the season.

14:00.371 --> 14:02.304
I don't plan on putting down roots here.

14:02.339 --> 14:04.273
So, you got big plans, do you,

14:04.308 --> 14:06.041
for you and your little Chia Pet?

14:06.076 --> 14:07.509
You know, tell me...

14:07.544 --> 14:10.111
If you want to get rid of me so bad,

14:10.146 --> 14:12.213
why don't you just call the network

14:12.248 --> 14:13.614
and have them remove me?

14:13.649 --> 14:16.350
Is it because you
don't have enough juice

14:16.386 --> 14:18.485
or you don't have the balls to do that?

14:18.521 --> 14:20.654
You know, you're awfully
obsessed with my balls.

14:20.689 --> 14:22.323
You should probably look into that.

14:22.358 --> 14:25.158
Featuring Ruby again
after last week's ratings,

14:25.193 --> 14:26.893
- which were crap...
- Right.

14:26.929 --> 14:29.996
Oh, unless you don't know
how to read those e-mails,

14:30.032 --> 14:32.465
you know, the ones with all
the numbers on them and stuff.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.201
10 years from now, maybe 5,

14:35.237 --> 14:37.070
no one's even gonna know
what a broadcast network is.

14:37.105 --> 14:39.705
They won't. We'll be
watching everything online.

14:39.741 --> 14:41.474
So the only thing that matters is,

14:41.509 --> 14:43.142
can you make some noise?

14:43.177 --> 14:46.845
You've been doing the same
thing you've done for 14 seasons.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.880
It's just...

14:48.916 --> 14:50.849
It's not noisy anymore.

14:50.884 --> 14:53.085
I'm sorry, Quinn.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.855
Have a good night.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.657
Madison!

15:00.927 --> 15:02.427
Find me Wagerstein.

15:02.462 --> 15:05.696
I want Ruby's files in
my hands 10 seconds go.

15:05.731 --> 15:06.730
Go!

15:11.071 --> 15:14.572
Oh... I can make some noise.

15:19.876 --> 15:21.943
Okay, that's perfect. So, this
is as far as we're gonna go.

15:21.978 --> 15:23.978
So, I'll come get you in the morning.

15:24.014 --> 15:25.213
We'll do a champagne brunch
and a quick little debrief.

15:25.248 --> 15:26.480
- Sound good?
- Mm-hmm.

15:26.516 --> 15:27.682
All right, cool.

15:27.717 --> 15:28.882
So you want to give us a kiss

15:28.918 --> 15:31.151
before we shut the door?

15:33.523 --> 15:36.156
Oh, my God, that is so beautiful!

15:36.192 --> 15:38.125
Ruby.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.384
Win this bitch.

15:40.384 --> 15:41.362
- You got this.
- Okay.

15:41.397 --> 15:43.229
Okay?

15:48.036 --> 15:50.002
Okay, no pressure.

15:50.038 --> 15:51.771
Hey, just get me a quick shot of this,

15:51.807 --> 15:53.906
and then we're done, okay?

15:53.942 --> 15:55.508
We don't have to do anything.

15:55.544 --> 15:57.043
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

15:58.580 --> 16:00.879
- But I am going to open that.
- Yes, please.

16:00.914 --> 16:03.515
Please do that.

16:05.152 --> 16:07.853
Wait. Hang on.

16:10.090 --> 16:11.757
Just in case.

16:11.792 --> 16:16.094
Oh, you think you're so smart.

16:16.129 --> 16:17.762
But guess who's smarter?

16:21.634 --> 16:25.069
Boom!

16:25.104 --> 16:27.137
Look, I want to make sure
we're off the grid.

16:38.851 --> 16:40.617
I'm sorry. Um...

16:42.421 --> 16:43.620
Weird shit, right?

16:43.655 --> 16:44.721
Uh-huh.

16:44.757 --> 16:47.657
Fine. Forget romance.

16:47.693 --> 16:48.825
If Ruby could do

16:48.861 --> 16:50.459
anything she wanted for once

16:50.495 --> 16:52.294
and nobody was watching,

16:52.329 --> 16:53.662
what would it be?

16:53.698 --> 16:55.063
Hmm.

16:55.099 --> 16:56.965
What?

16:57.001 --> 16:58.667
Whoo!

16:58.703 --> 16:59.935
Okay.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.270
Look, girl, they're gonna think

17:01.305 --> 17:02.471
we're having wild, crazy sex in here.

17:02.507 --> 17:03.739
Oh! Do you really care? Come on.

17:03.775 --> 17:05.073
Just come jump with me.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.675
- Jump.
- Wait. Ah. Um...

17:07.711 --> 17:11.012
I would rather just watch you.

17:11.047 --> 17:13.615
Okay. Your loss.

17:13.650 --> 17:15.683
Whoo! Ooh! I know. I know.

17:15.719 --> 17:17.452
Wait. What the hell, Quinn?

17:17.487 --> 17:20.454
How do you even have
audio in the suitor's room?

17:20.490 --> 17:24.125
Oh, I, uh... I put up four new cameras,

17:24.160 --> 17:27.359
and they seem to be
working pretty damn well.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.162
Yeah, but this is the overnight.

17:29.197 --> 17:30.363
You're breaking the rules.

17:30.399 --> 17:32.165
Actually, those are my rules.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.835
I made them, so I can
break them anytime I want.

17:34.870 --> 17:36.937
What are you trying to do?

17:36.972 --> 17:39.773
Capture this love story.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.475
Right? It's gold, Jay.

17:42.510 --> 17:46.479
You did some really nice
work, so why waste it?

17:46.514 --> 17:48.614
'Cause we can never use any of this.

17:48.650 --> 17:53.986
Well, I mean, our first
black couple falling in love,

17:54.021 --> 17:56.355
making "Everlasting" history?

17:56.390 --> 17:58.957
I don't know, Quinn.

17:58.992 --> 18:01.392
You know, I... I mean, I promised Ruby.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.027
You know, she thinks no one's watching.

18:03.063 --> 18:04.830
You know, you didn't seem
to have a problem last week.

18:04.865 --> 18:06.998
And now it seems like
she might go all the way,

18:07.033 --> 18:08.800
and you're suddenly feeling skittish?

18:08.836 --> 18:09.801
No. That was different.

18:09.837 --> 18:10.902
Oh, okay.

18:10.938 --> 18:12.537
You know, fine.

18:12.573 --> 18:16.640
You can turn the
cameras off if you want.

18:18.744 --> 18:21.311
But, you know, don't blame me

18:21.347 --> 18:23.848
when you're still
wrangling anorexic bimbos

18:23.883 --> 18:28.085
because nobody got
to see your best work.

18:31.290 --> 18:35.525
♪ I'll take you up, up
to where we belong ♪

18:40.064 --> 18:43.700
♪ I'll take you up, up
to where we belong ♪

18:43.735 --> 18:45.434
- Okay. You ready for this?
- Totally.

18:45.470 --> 18:47.069
Wait. Do you know all these people?

18:47.105 --> 18:48.605
Some of them.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.338
The pair in the power glasses there...

18:50.374 --> 18:51.707
They're the head of HBO docs.

18:51.742 --> 18:53.408
- I'm gonna introduce you.
- I love it!

18:53.443 --> 18:55.176
- Middle-aged hottie at the bar...
- Yeah.

18:55.212 --> 18:56.444
She runs scripted at PBS.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.581
And there is John Booth.

19:00.885 --> 19:02.954
Oh, boy. The guy that
just bought our network?

19:02.954 --> 19:04.553
- No, no, no.
- He didn't just buy our network.

19:04.588 --> 19:06.754
He went on a shopping
spree, bought a whole empire.

19:06.789 --> 19:08.956
- Let's go sell him something.
- What are you talking about?

19:08.992 --> 19:10.424
We can't just sell him something.

19:10.459 --> 19:11.792
- We don't have anything to...
- Yes, we can.

19:11.828 --> 19:13.193
That's what I'm talking about.

19:13.229 --> 19:14.629
We put on fancy clothes,
and we just go and...

19:14.664 --> 19:16.230
And what... Lie our ass off?

19:16.265 --> 19:17.865
I was gonna say sell.

19:17.901 --> 19:19.700
These guys... they don't
they don't buy shows.

19:19.736 --> 19:21.101
They buy the people behind the shows,

19:21.137 --> 19:22.937
so we're selling ourselves.

19:24.272 --> 19:26.540
Let's go.

19:28.343 --> 19:30.443
John Booth?

19:30.478 --> 19:32.646
Coleman Wasserman. I'm the
showrunner at "Everlasting."

19:32.681 --> 19:34.414
This is my producing
partner, Rachel Goldberg.

19:34.449 --> 19:35.448
Hi.

19:35.483 --> 19:37.450
Really?

19:37.485 --> 19:39.385
Well, I've got a question for you.

19:40.522 --> 19:42.254
Is Beth Ann going all the way?

19:42.289 --> 19:43.722
'Cause I'd like nothing more

19:43.758 --> 19:45.624
than to see Little Miss
Sweet Home Alabama

19:45.660 --> 19:46.992
bring home a black suitor.

19:47.028 --> 19:49.428
I'm "Everlasting's" biggest fan.

19:51.799 --> 19:55.067
This should really be a...
a sweat lodge.

19:55.102 --> 19:57.002
That's the way we did it at my retreat.

19:57.038 --> 19:58.369
What are you trying to do here, Chet?

19:59.839 --> 20:01.405
Get to the truth.

20:01.441 --> 20:02.406
About what?

20:02.442 --> 20:03.908
Sit down.

20:06.212 --> 20:10.014
We lie to ourselves... all the time.

20:10.050 --> 20:12.817
We're men, so we have
trouble asking for help,

20:12.852 --> 20:16.119
but tonight, we're
gonna help each other.

20:16.154 --> 20:20.190
And it's gonna hurt, but
we're gonna get clarity.

20:20.225 --> 20:22.125
You want to start?

20:22.160 --> 20:24.661
No, you... you... You lead it off.

20:24.697 --> 20:26.362
You show me how it's done.

20:26.398 --> 20:28.999
Okay.

20:31.403 --> 20:32.702
Cynthia was right.

20:32.737 --> 20:35.137
I stole my kid. I did.

20:35.172 --> 20:37.439
It wasn't a mistake.
It wasn't an accident.

20:37.475 --> 20:40.375
It was my fault, and I got to...

20:40.411 --> 20:44.614
I got to take responsibility
for what I did.

20:44.649 --> 20:47.650
Especially with Quinn.

20:49.052 --> 20:50.418
God, that's intense.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.056
Okay.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.830
Uh... I got demoted today.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.566
Fired.

21:05.602 --> 21:08.068
I got fired, actually,

21:08.104 --> 21:09.737
by a network douche bag

21:09.772 --> 21:13.040
who has no idea how
talented I am at my job.

21:13.075 --> 21:14.108
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

21:15.778 --> 21:18.478
That's blame. It's not the truth.

21:18.514 --> 21:20.413
I told you this was gonna hurt.

21:20.449 --> 21:21.481
Try it again.

21:23.752 --> 21:26.157
What J.J. is doing for "Star Wars,"

21:26.157 --> 21:27.086
that's what we're
doing for "Everlasting."

21:27.122 --> 21:29.188
We're rebuilding this franchise

21:29.223 --> 21:30.589
so it can live up to its own headlines.

21:30.625 --> 21:32.091
And we're really hoping just to have,

21:32.127 --> 21:34.761
um, huge ratings with
some social relevance.

21:34.796 --> 21:36.095
The first step black suitor.

21:36.131 --> 21:37.163
That was all Rachel's idea.

21:37.198 --> 21:38.531
I don't want you to think

21:38.566 --> 21:40.165
that it was, like,
some crass ratings grab.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.500
No, no, no, no, no.
It's explosive, timely.

21:42.536 --> 21:43.902
This kind of stuff matters.

21:43.937 --> 21:46.504
You see, to me, television
is a land rush,

21:46.540 --> 21:48.707
and I'm looking for
pioneers who aren't afraid

21:48.742 --> 21:50.108
to go out into the wilderness,

21:50.144 --> 21:51.910
stake a claim to a new
piece of territory,

21:51.945 --> 21:53.679
and then bring in the masses.

21:53.714 --> 21:57.381
If you're looking for pioneers,
why are you talking to them?

21:59.952 --> 22:03.120
By the time they came to town,
the whorehouse had a bidet,

22:03.156 --> 22:05.422
and the saloon had recessed lighting.

22:05.457 --> 22:07.024
John Booth, Quinn King.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.659
Well, well, it's true.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.796
You do fill a room.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.564
Oh, is that what these two
have been saying about me?

22:14.599 --> 22:16.700
Oh, actually, they
haven't mentioned you once.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.301
I did my due diligence.

22:18.336 --> 22:21.571
Mm. Should I be worried?

22:21.606 --> 22:23.439
On the contrary.

22:23.474 --> 22:24.908
Everyone here knows

22:24.943 --> 22:27.060
that you're the true
creator of "Everlasting,"

22:27.060 --> 22:30.913
and in a roomful of
legends, you're a legend.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.993
I can't believe she just showed up here.

22:37.028 --> 22:38.395
Ah.

22:38.430 --> 22:40.070
Ah, we impressed him earlier.

22:40.398 --> 22:42.031
Don't undo all of that good work by...

22:42.066 --> 22:44.233
I literally want to stab her
in the eyes with lobster forks.

22:44.268 --> 22:45.734
Doing something like that.

22:45.769 --> 22:47.403
Just relax and have a drink. Come on.

22:47.438 --> 22:48.504
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

22:48.539 --> 22:49.838
Two champagnes.

22:49.874 --> 22:53.008
Well, I hope my trolls
didn't harass you.

22:53.043 --> 22:54.609
They don't get out that much.

22:54.644 --> 22:56.677
I'm not easily harassed.

22:56.713 --> 22:58.579
Tell me... What is it like

22:58.615 --> 23:00.681
to be able to buy anything you want?

23:00.717 --> 23:04.152
Well, not... anything.

23:05.922 --> 23:07.888
No, look, it's it's exciting.

23:07.923 --> 23:10.690
It takes the whole concept of fear away.

23:10.726 --> 23:14.128
Look, I really am a
true fan of the show.

23:14.163 --> 23:16.430
I get so much grief about
it down at the cigar club,

23:16.465 --> 23:18.965
but honestly, I've
never missed an episode.

23:19.001 --> 23:21.268
Hmm. Who knew?

23:21.303 --> 23:23.270
So, tell me. What's the
What's the secret?

23:23.305 --> 23:25.271
How do you get that much
crazy into one house?

23:25.306 --> 23:26.739
Well...

23:26.774 --> 23:28.974
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

23:29.010 --> 23:30.376
Hold that thought.

23:30.412 --> 23:31.877
Hello?

23:31.913 --> 23:33.312
The Eagle has landed.

23:33.348 --> 23:35.415
I repeat... the Eagle has landed.

23:35.450 --> 23:36.815
Um, that just means

23:36.851 --> 23:38.384
that the thing that
you asked me to do...

23:38.420 --> 23:39.585
He landed at the airport.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.153
Okay, I got it, all right?

23:41.188 --> 23:43.621
Just take him to the mansion right away.

23:43.657 --> 23:44.889
Yes, I will be there.

23:46.193 --> 23:47.926
Oh. Here's a fearless idea.

23:47.961 --> 23:50.228
How would you like to come
see the crazy for yourself?

23:50.264 --> 23:51.463
Now?

23:51.498 --> 23:53.465
- Yeah.
- I-I'm in.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.300
Shall we?

23:58.137 --> 23:59.970
You know, I didn't even tell my family

24:00.005 --> 24:02.639
that I was dropping out of
school and coming on this show.

24:02.675 --> 24:03.941
You're kidding.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.509
No. I was going to.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.611
I had my little speech
planned and everything.

24:08.647 --> 24:09.813
But I just chickened out.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.015
Well, I'm sure they know now.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.251
Yeah.

24:14.287 --> 24:17.454
I came on this show to make a point.

24:17.489 --> 24:19.855
I never really expected any of this.

24:19.891 --> 24:23.659
Who you are makes a point, Ruby.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.697
I have been going to protests

24:27.732 --> 24:29.665
with my dad since I was 6 years old.

24:29.701 --> 24:33.102
Tiny, little Ruby with a
tiny, little picket sign?

24:33.137 --> 24:34.436
Yeah, but, like, really.

24:34.472 --> 24:35.770
Snaggletooth, Black Power fist,

24:35.806 --> 24:36.771
up on his shoulders.

24:39.009 --> 24:40.675
He's kind of like my hero.

24:40.711 --> 24:41.943
I just don't want to let him down.

24:41.979 --> 24:42.978
I get that.

24:43.013 --> 24:45.447
I do. I get that.

24:46.984 --> 24:50.384
You know, when I go out
there every Sunday and play,

24:50.420 --> 24:52.286
I'm not playing for myself.

24:52.322 --> 24:55.723
I'm playing for my mom, my cousin,

24:55.758 --> 24:57.125
my nieces I'm putting through college,

24:57.160 --> 24:59.026
my nephew I've got working for me now.

24:59.061 --> 25:00.861
That's a lot of pressure.

25:00.896 --> 25:02.330
And sometimes I think,

25:02.365 --> 25:06.033
"What if I didn't play football anymore?

25:06.068 --> 25:09.402
You know, what if... What if I couldn't?

25:09.438 --> 25:12.172
What if I was just a normal guy?"

25:12.207 --> 25:13.806
Can I be totally honest with you?

25:13.842 --> 25:15.575
You better.

25:15.611 --> 25:19.513
I would like that guy even more.

25:20.949 --> 25:23.549
Come here.

25:48.041 --> 25:50.542
Rach, hey, you are never
gonna believe this.

25:50.577 --> 25:52.910
Jay, please tell me that Ruby didn't
back out and cause a total scene.

25:52.945 --> 25:54.745
No, no, no. It's all cool.

25:54.781 --> 25:56.047
It's good. She's doing amazing.

25:56.082 --> 25:57.714
It's like "The Notebook"
for black people.

25:57.749 --> 25:59.916
What? How do you even know that?

25:59.951 --> 26:02.186
Because Quinn put four new cameras

26:02.221 --> 26:03.587
in the suitor's suite.

26:03.622 --> 26:04.688
What?

26:04.723 --> 26:06.190
No. It's all good. Trust me.

26:06.225 --> 26:08.091
It's like... The stuff
between them, Rach...

26:08.126 --> 26:09.793
It's like a miracle.

26:09.828 --> 26:11.261
Not the sex stuff, obviously.

26:11.297 --> 26:13.197
Jay, just lis... Listen to me, okay?

26:13.232 --> 26:14.397
This has nothing to do with sex.

26:14.432 --> 26:15.598
If Quinn put cameras in there,

26:15.633 --> 26:16.799
she is up to something.

26:16.834 --> 26:18.934
No. No, she's not even...

26:18.969 --> 26:21.270
Something is about to happen.
Find out what it is.

26:21.306 --> 26:23.772
♪ That you take control,
that you take control of me ♪

26:23.808 --> 26:25.107
- We have to go.
- Mm.

26:25.142 --> 26:26.609
We have to go. I'm not even kidding.

26:26.644 --> 26:28.811
- What happened?
- I sw... Jay just called me.

26:28.846 --> 26:30.213
Stop doing that!

26:30.248 --> 26:32.280
Then stop taking shortcuts!

26:32.316 --> 26:33.748
What did I tell you?
This was gonna hurt.

26:33.783 --> 26:36.084
You have to do the work.
Own your failings!

26:36.119 --> 26:38.386
- What do you want me to say?!
- Say your damage!

26:38.422 --> 26:41.323
♪ That you take control,
that you take control of me ♪

26:41.358 --> 26:42.990
- Rachel!
- There you go.

26:43.026 --> 26:44.559
My damage is Rachel.

26:44.595 --> 26:46.494
She's a... She's a black hole.
She's a cancer.

26:46.530 --> 26:48.229
- Whose fault is that?
- It's mine.

26:48.264 --> 26:49.796
- Why?
- 'Cause I loved her!

26:52.635 --> 26:53.834
I love her.

26:55.015 --> 26:56.271
Clarity.

26:57.707 --> 26:59.806
Feels good, doesn't it?

26:59.842 --> 27:02.309
It feels like shit.

27:06.314 --> 27:06.986
Where is Ruby?

27:06.986 --> 27:08.848
I want to see my daughter right now.

27:08.883 --> 27:10.516
I'm taking you to my boss... Quinn.

27:10.552 --> 27:12.252
Madison, where are you?

27:12.287 --> 27:13.953
- I can't right now, Jay.
- Right.

27:13.988 --> 27:16.188
What the hell are you doing?
Is something going on?

27:16.224 --> 27:18.758
Ah. Welcome to the inner sanctum.

27:18.793 --> 27:20.685
Mm. Feels like I just
stepped inside your brain.

27:21.363 --> 27:22.994
Quinn, this is a closed set.
What are you doing?

27:23.029 --> 27:26.265
Well, well, well, hello.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.133
Oh, good girl.

27:29.903 --> 27:32.471
Quinn, he's here.

27:32.506 --> 27:33.705
Mm. Oh, buckle up.

27:33.741 --> 27:35.574
- What, it gets better?
- Mm-hmm.

27:35.609 --> 27:37.476
Dr. Carter, welcome.

27:37.511 --> 27:39.310
No, no, no, no. You can't be here.

27:39.345 --> 27:42.079
I have been trying to reach
you people for weeks.

27:42.114 --> 27:44.214
Where's Ruby?

27:44.250 --> 27:45.650
Where's my daughter?

27:45.685 --> 27:49.520
Uh, this is a little awkward, but, um...

27:49.555 --> 27:50.988
What is this?

27:55.361 --> 27:56.726
Oh, my God.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.928
No.

28:01.791 --> 28:03.915
What the hell are you people doing?

28:04.387 --> 28:05.651
This is pornography.

28:05.687 --> 28:07.653
We're never gonna air any of this.

28:07.689 --> 28:09.622
- I mean, there's always a chance.
- Damn it.

28:09.657 --> 28:11.458
- How do I get these things off?
- Where's my daughter?

28:11.493 --> 28:12.825
Tell me now, or I call the police.

28:12.861 --> 28:14.527
Okay, calm down, Dr. Carter.

28:14.562 --> 28:15.962
I'll take you to her right away, okay?

28:15.998 --> 28:17.763
Sit tight. Make us some drinks.

28:17.799 --> 28:20.133
Madison, cameras up
outside my office now.

28:20.168 --> 28:22.767
Cameras up outside of
Quinn's office right now.

28:24.838 --> 28:25.971
Where are you?

28:26.007 --> 28:27.601
It's right this way.

28:27.601 --> 28:28.243
Rach.

28:28.267 --> 28:30.209
Honestly, you couldn't
keep him out of there?

28:30.211 --> 28:31.543
He was already here before I knew.

28:31.578 --> 28:34.179
What was I... No. No, no, no, no, no.

28:34.215 --> 28:36.348
No, no, no, no. Hey, guys, cameras down.

28:36.384 --> 28:38.350
Guys, let's keep those cameras
down. Guys, cameras down!

28:38.386 --> 28:39.550
- Mr. Carter, stop. Stop. Stop.
- Seriously.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.119
Please stop.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.554
- Ruby. Oh.
- Dad?

28:43.589 --> 28:44.788
Oh, my God.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.290
Please, let's get out of here.

28:46.326 --> 28:48.493
- Your dad?
- What are you doing here?

28:48.528 --> 28:49.105
Honestly?

28:49.129 --> 28:50.062
- What are you doing?
- Get in there. Get in there.

28:50.063 --> 28:51.695
No, don't go in... Don't get in there.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.364
Don't go anywhere. No,
no, no. Stay right there.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.166
Don't go in there. Don't.
Seriously. Yeah, sit there.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.192
You can't help yourself,
can you, Quinn, huh?

28:56.192 --> 28:56.914
I want security down here.

28:56.914 --> 28:58.218
- I want Ruby's dad out of here.
- Fine.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.604
You can shut this down.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.307
And you can produce a sad,
boring little NPR morality play.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.325
Or you can let this be the
great piece of television

29:07.325 --> 29:08.771
- that you know that it is.
- What are you doing?

29:08.771 --> 29:10.781
You know you want to tell that story.

29:10.816 --> 29:14.651
This is who you are, Rachel,
and this is what we love to do.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.119
You're coming with me.

29:16.154 --> 29:17.353
Mr. Carter, step outside, please.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.688
How could you let him in here?

29:18.723 --> 29:20.422
Somebody do something.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.991
I will carry you out of
here on my back if I have to.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.826
- Please.
- Do you have any idea

29:23.862 --> 29:26.462
of the impact this will
have on our foundation?

29:28.800 --> 29:29.765
All right, come on. Let's go.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.367
Rachel, no. No.

29:32.402 --> 29:34.536
Rach, no.

29:34.571 --> 29:37.605
No, no, no, no, no. I said
get that camera out of here!

29:37.641 --> 29:39.374
No. Get out. Get out. Get
that camera out of here.

29:39.409 --> 29:41.276
17 million people will be watching this.

29:41.311 --> 29:43.645
- Keep this cool. Keep it cool, okay?
- Get them out of here.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.881
You go ahead. Tell your daughter
what you want her to hear.

29:54.824 --> 29:57.624
You've worked so hard... MENSA at 16,

29:57.660 --> 29:59.160
Phi Beta Kappa for this?

29:59.195 --> 30:00.895
- None of that's changed.
- It's all changed.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.863
Whenever someone Googles you now,

30:02.899 --> 30:04.630
the first thing that'll
come up is this show.

30:04.666 --> 30:06.199
Daddy, I came on this show to have

30:06.234 --> 30:08.334
a wider platform for
what we're trying to say.

30:08.369 --> 30:10.103
Then how did you end up here?

30:11.239 --> 30:12.605
I fell in love.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.474
Oh, my God.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.243
Love after four weeks on a reality show?

30:17.278 --> 30:18.745
What the hell's gotten into you?

30:18.780 --> 30:21.046
He's a pro football player, Ruby.

30:21.082 --> 30:23.048
- I make $40 million a year.
- Dad, you don't even know him.

30:23.084 --> 30:25.517
I know all I need to know.
Bitch, please.

30:25.552 --> 30:26.819
Dad, you're making a fool of yourself.

30:26.854 --> 30:28.587
No, he is!

30:28.622 --> 30:32.024
To be where he is, in his position,

30:32.059 --> 30:34.226
and not doing more for his people.

30:34.261 --> 30:36.261
- Dr. Carter...
- Please, can we just talk?

30:36.296 --> 30:37.762
Once you leave here, sweetheart,

30:37.797 --> 30:39.197
you'll see how you
were deluded, all right?

30:39.232 --> 30:40.198
Come on.

30:40.233 --> 30:42.100
I'm taking you home.

30:42.135 --> 30:42.967
No, you're not.

30:46.206 --> 30:49.207
I'm sorry, Dad, but I'm staying here.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.850
I'm so ashamed of you.

31:23.741 --> 31:25.540
Wow. Hell of a show.

31:25.576 --> 31:26.742
You don't mess around.

31:26.778 --> 31:28.477
Sometimes you just get lucky.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.279
Mm. I don't believe that for a second.

31:31.314 --> 31:33.248
I think you're just like me.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.750
We make our own luck.

31:35.786 --> 31:39.420
Now, I always thought this
was scripted or made up.

31:39.455 --> 31:42.490
Oh, we don't make it up.
We make it happen.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.425
Well, to the master of disaster.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.327
Ah. Hmm.

31:47.362 --> 31:51.631
Uh, Jay, Madison, wake the girls up.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.233
We're having an elimination ceremony.

31:54.837 --> 31:56.103
Quinn, it's almost midnight.

31:56.138 --> 31:57.905
I don't care how late it is.

31:57.940 --> 32:00.740
And if I see one
droopy eye or saggy tit,

32:00.776 --> 32:02.276
someone's getting fired.

32:05.446 --> 32:07.680
Why don't you go outside
and meet the girls

32:07.715 --> 32:09.415
while I get this thing ready?

32:09.450 --> 32:11.517
- Can I meet Beth Ann?
- Sure.

32:11.552 --> 32:13.085
She might even say the "N" word for you.

32:13.121 --> 32:15.587
The set's right around the corner.

32:24.865 --> 32:25.931
What the hell is wrong with you?

32:25.966 --> 32:27.432
You sent in her father?

32:27.467 --> 32:30.297
Yeah, and you sent in
the camera after him.

32:30.297 --> 32:30.601
But can you just admit

32:30.637 --> 32:32.304
that this has nothing
to do with the show?

32:32.339 --> 32:33.671
This is all about you being upset

32:33.707 --> 32:35.273
that you weren't invited to the party,

32:35.309 --> 32:36.774
and so you're taking it out on Ruby.

32:36.810 --> 32:38.375
Oh, don't kid yourself, Rachel.

32:38.410 --> 32:40.110
I am always invited to the party.

32:40.146 --> 32:41.478
The only reason why you went

32:41.513 --> 32:43.113
is because you're banging the boss.

32:43.149 --> 32:44.614
Well, I learned from the best.

32:44.650 --> 32:46.683
You think Coleman's
your ticket out of here?

32:46.719 --> 32:47.223
Please.

32:47.223 --> 32:49.686
You could run circles around
that snot-nosed little brat.

32:49.722 --> 32:51.188
You're just too scared to.

32:51.224 --> 32:52.789
You know something? I am not scared.

32:52.825 --> 32:55.225
For the first time in my life,
I actually have a partner.

32:55.260 --> 32:56.692
Wha... He's not your partner.

32:56.728 --> 32:58.828
He's your Chet, okay?

32:58.864 --> 33:01.759
He's gonna steal all of your
ideas and take the credit.

33:01.759 --> 33:03.032
Nope. Coleman is not Chet.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.034
Yes, he is, but you're not me.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.036
You're not gonna survive it, okay?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.571
You're gonna be right back
to sleeping in your car

33:08.606 --> 33:10.006
and snorting cold
medicine for breakfast.

33:10.041 --> 33:13.075
Okay, let me paint you
a very different picture.

33:13.110 --> 33:14.509
In three years,

33:14.544 --> 33:16.778
I will have my own show
and a man that loves me.

33:17.748 --> 33:20.082
Okay, I am just trying
to protect you, Rachel.

33:20.117 --> 33:22.851
From what, the beautiful
life that you never had?

33:22.887 --> 33:24.019
No, thanks.

33:24.054 --> 33:25.387
He's a user.

33:25.422 --> 33:29.690
Just... be careful, okay?

33:41.748 --> 33:43.747
Hey.

33:44.283 --> 33:47.850
I am so sorry about my father.

33:47.886 --> 33:50.420
Hey, not the first time a
girl's dad walked in on me.

33:50.455 --> 33:54.090
Well, first time since
high school maybe.

34:00.932 --> 34:03.098
I know he's your dad, okay, but...

34:03.133 --> 34:04.933
He can be an ass.

34:04.968 --> 34:09.804
Mnh. Not quite the word
I was gonna use, but...

34:09.840 --> 34:11.540
The things he said...

34:11.576 --> 34:13.542
He was just surprised and angry and...

34:13.578 --> 34:17.079
Yeah, but he wasn't wrong,
not about all of it.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.281
This might sound crazy to you,

34:20.317 --> 34:23.384
but I know that I was put on
this earth to make a difference,

34:23.420 --> 34:24.918
to be heard, and...

34:24.954 --> 34:27.589
And not to fall for a
dumb-ass football player.

34:27.623 --> 34:28.755
But you're more than that.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.407
I don't know, Ruby.

34:30.407 --> 34:31.246
Yeah, but
you said...

34:33.496 --> 34:35.661
Well, don't you want to be?

34:35.697 --> 34:38.498
You can do more.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.766
You could speak up.

34:39.801 --> 34:41.967
I could teach you.

34:42.003 --> 34:45.438
You can be everything my
father says that you're not.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.574
You know that, right?

34:47.610 --> 34:49.943
Yeah.

34:49.978 --> 34:51.445
I know that.

35:17.170 --> 35:21.172
Ladies, obviously it's, uh...
It's been a very long night.

35:21.207 --> 35:23.708
But for one of you, it is about to end.

35:23.744 --> 35:27.144
If your candle is extinguished,
it is time to say goodbye.

35:27.179 --> 35:31.882
Darius, before you say anything...

35:31.917 --> 35:33.550
I need to apologize

35:33.586 --> 35:36.587
for the dirty, disgusting
mistakes I've made.

35:36.622 --> 35:40.824
"Mistakes." You hear that?
That's plural.

35:40.859 --> 35:42.326
I did something beneath me.

35:42.361 --> 35:45.861
Yael, stop.

35:45.897 --> 35:47.430
I'm not here to judge anybody.

35:47.465 --> 35:50.833
Um... actually, yes, you...
You are here to judge us.

35:50.868 --> 35:52.669
We are all human.

35:52.704 --> 35:54.537
We all make mistakes.

35:54.572 --> 35:56.539
The best we can do is learn from them.

35:56.574 --> 35:58.675
You're safe tonight, Yael.

36:00.377 --> 36:02.377
Oh, my...

36:04.080 --> 36:06.014
Dominique.

36:06.049 --> 36:08.550
Seriously? Me?

36:08.585 --> 36:10.218
All I did was to tell you the truth.

36:10.253 --> 36:11.720
So that you could bring
somebody else down.

36:11.755 --> 36:14.222
Come on! Is this a joke?

36:14.257 --> 36:15.557
You can't do this.

36:15.592 --> 36:17.891
You know, I'm getting a little tired

36:17.927 --> 36:20.060
of being told what I can and can't do.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.437
Camera A, follow her.

36:29.472 --> 36:31.104
Wow. Tough night, huh?

36:31.140 --> 36:32.807
I'm not done. I got one more.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.608
He's going off book, ladies.
Darius is calling an audible.

36:35.644 --> 36:38.211
No. No. No, no, no.

36:38.246 --> 36:39.646
What are you doing?

36:39.681 --> 36:41.314
No, no, no, no.

36:41.350 --> 36:44.784
I'm sorry, Ruby, but your dad was right.

36:44.820 --> 36:48.087
You've got a lot of important
work ahead of you.

36:48.122 --> 36:49.489
Please don't do this.

36:49.524 --> 36:52.924
Look. Whoever it is
you think I could be...

36:52.960 --> 36:54.493
you should go be with that guy.

36:54.528 --> 36:55.661
No.

36:55.696 --> 36:57.128
Darius, that's not what I meant.

36:57.164 --> 36:59.264
Okay. Maybe I could do more.

36:59.299 --> 37:01.115
I'm not saying you're wrong.

37:01.115 --> 37:01.767
I'm just saying

37:01.802 --> 37:06.137
I don't feel like I'm
enough for you or your dad.

37:08.208 --> 37:09.974
And I don't like how that feels.

37:10.009 --> 37:12.243
Darius, please.

37:12.278 --> 37:13.911
It's gonna be too much work

37:13.946 --> 37:16.313
disappointing you every day, Ruby.

37:30.562 --> 37:32.161
I can't believe I trusted you.

37:32.197 --> 37:33.930
Jay, I did everything I could.

37:37.503 --> 37:39.202
Ladies, uh, that concludes

37:39.237 --> 37:41.438
our elimination ceremony this evening.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.440
Good night.

37:46.644 --> 37:52.180
Well, did you, uh, see
everything you needed to see?

37:52.216 --> 37:53.916
Not quite.

37:57.388 --> 37:59.621
Oh.

38:04.494 --> 38:06.795
You, uh... You want
to come home with me?

38:08.932 --> 38:10.364
Uh, which home?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.199
Don't you have three or four?

38:12.235 --> 38:14.469
Six. No, seven.

38:14.504 --> 38:15.804
You can choose.

38:15.839 --> 38:21.341
I would, but I have this thing tomorrow.

38:21.376 --> 38:23.143
Well, that sounds incredibly vague.

38:24.613 --> 38:27.180
My dad died.

38:27.215 --> 38:28.549
Funeral's tomorrow.

38:28.584 --> 38:30.183
I still need a coffin.

38:31.620 --> 38:33.019
Costco's open late.

38:34.055 --> 38:35.187
Not many people know this,

38:35.222 --> 38:37.056
but Costco sells coffins.

38:37.091 --> 38:39.391
They have a full mortuary
services department.

38:39.427 --> 38:41.093
And how would you know that?

38:41.128 --> 38:43.295
Well, that's a billionaire
becomes a billionaire.

38:45.099 --> 38:47.467
Uh, then to Costco it is.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.750
Do you want to talk about...

39:05.786 --> 39:08.752
About Ruby? What's to talk about?

39:08.788 --> 39:10.521
- I mean, I feel like...
- Hmm.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.189
The footage is probably
gonna be amazing.

39:12.224 --> 39:14.091
That's just how we make the show.

39:14.126 --> 39:15.457
You know, we're just, like,
following the stories.

39:15.481 --> 39:16.301
Yeah.

39:17.014 --> 39:18.230
I guess I'm just a little surprised

39:18.230 --> 39:19.363
you let Quinn get between us.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.098
She's not.

39:21.133 --> 39:22.232
She's not between us.

39:22.267 --> 39:23.834
Good.

39:25.403 --> 39:27.103
Look, it's been a long night.

39:27.138 --> 39:29.772
I think I'm just gonna
head home right now.

39:31.409 --> 39:32.876
Sounds great. I'm gonna...

39:32.911 --> 39:34.210
Yeah, I'm gonna return my dress.

39:34.245 --> 39:37.213
You looked really beautiful tonight.

39:37.248 --> 39:38.447
Thank you.

39:42.753 --> 39:45.286
Good night, Wasserman.

39:45.322 --> 39:46.488
See you, "Vassar."

40:08.144 --> 40:09.810
You're working overtime.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.814
No, I'm just, uh... I'm
just changing my clothes.

40:13.850 --> 40:15.349
We got to talk, Rach.

40:15.384 --> 40:17.516
I really don't feel
like talking right now.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.318
Why did you send your douche bag

40:19.354 --> 40:22.656
little lackey of a
boyfriend to demote me?

40:22.691 --> 40:25.508
I, like, honestly don't even
know what you're talking about.

40:25.532 --> 40:25.826
Bullshit.

40:25.827 --> 40:27.427
Dude, you're drunk, and
you're being an ass right now.

40:27.462 --> 40:28.828
I'm being an ass?

40:28.864 --> 40:30.597
Well, I guess we're
the perfect pair, then,

40:30.632 --> 40:34.600
because you're a selfish,
manipulative little bitch.

40:34.635 --> 40:35.868
- No. No.
- Jeremy, you...

40:35.903 --> 40:37.670
- No. No.
- You want to demote me?

40:37.705 --> 40:39.640
You demote me to my face.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.196
You want to fire me,

40:41.196 --> 40:42.371
you fire me to my face.

40:42.371 --> 40:45.747
Money, dick, power, right? Right?

40:45.747 --> 40:47.546
You know what you need?

40:47.582 --> 40:48.814
You don't need a boyfriend.

40:48.849 --> 40:50.481
You don't need a boyfriend, Rachel.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.450
What you need is a zoo keeper

40:52.485 --> 40:55.853
'cause you're a wild animal who
if is let go... I am a wild...

41:00.093 --> 41:02.259
That's not what a man does.

41:05.331 --> 41:06.964
I tried to help you.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.665
You're fired.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.210
You okay?

41:21.680 --> 41:24.146
Yeah. I just have to change my clothes.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.418
Okay.
