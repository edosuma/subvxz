01:24.900 --> 01:26.480
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.610
This is crazy. What did I do?

01:28.690 --> 01:30.150
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.660
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

01:32.740 --> 01:33.950
We can talk, sir.

01:34.030 --> 01:37.830
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

01:37.910 --> 01:41.080
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.630
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

01:43.710 --> 01:46.500
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

01:46.590 --> 01:48.340
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

01:48.420 --> 01:51.170
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

01:51.260 --> 01:54.090
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

01:54.470 --> 01:56.970
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

01:57.060 --> 02:00.730
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

02:00.810 --> 02:02.980
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

02:03.060 --> 02:04.520
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

02:04.600 --> 02:07.520
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

02:07.610 --> 02:10.490
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

02:10.570 --> 02:14.450
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.370
All right.

02:19.450 --> 02:21.540
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.210
Please, no gang signs.

02:23.290 --> 02:24.880
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.960
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

02:28.130 --> 02:32.130
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.770
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

02:39.850 --> 02:41.560
What have we got?

02:42.810 --> 02:44.900
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

02:44.980 --> 02:46.020
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.900
Son of a bitch!

02:55.530 --> 02:58.370
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

03:27.600 --> 03:28.980
Whoa!

04:18.450 --> 04:19.740
Tony Stark.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.660
Visionary. Genius.

04:24.490 --> 04:26.370
American patriot.

04:26.450 --> 04:27.620
Even from an early age,

04:27.710 --> 04:30.170
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

04:30.250 --> 04:33.800
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.340
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.590
At age six, his first engine.

04:40.180 --> 04:44.100
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

04:45.060 --> 04:47.430
Then, the passing of a titan.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.940
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

04:52.020 --> 04:55.440
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

04:55.650 --> 04:58.990
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

04:59.070 --> 05:02.450
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

05:02.530 --> 05:03.870
With the keys to the kingdom,

05:03.950 --> 05:06.750
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

05:06.830 --> 05:10.870
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.840
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

05:14.920 --> 05:17.710
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

05:17.800 --> 05:20.380
and her interests around the globe.

05:28.730 --> 05:31.060
As liaison to Stark Industries,

05:31.650 --> 05:35.400
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

05:35.570 --> 05:39.240
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

05:39.690 --> 05:41.910
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

05:41.990 --> 05:46.330
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

05:53.540 --> 05:54.830
Tony?

06:07.140 --> 06:09.720
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

06:09.810 --> 06:13.480
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.020
This is wonderful.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.900
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

06:20.780 --> 06:25.910
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

06:26.240 --> 06:31.000
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

06:31.410 --> 06:32.830
Tony, you know...

06:32.910 --> 06:36.840
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.340
He's always working.

06:40.420 --> 06:43.840
Work it! Come on!

06:47.390 --> 06:50.930
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

06:51.020 --> 06:54.310
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

06:54.390 --> 06:55.350
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

06:55.440 --> 06:58.320
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.320
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.110
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

07:02.190 --> 07:04.320
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.780
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

07:05.860 --> 07:08.160
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.830
I don't have any of those
floating around.

07:09.910 --> 07:12.040
We're gonna let it ride!

07:13.120 --> 07:15.250
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.460
Okay, you, too.

07:16.540 --> 07:18.420
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

07:18.500 --> 07:21.000
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

07:21.090 --> 07:22.340
Two craps. Line away.

07:22.420 --> 07:24.260
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.760
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

07:26.300 --> 07:27.340
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

07:27.430 --> 07:28.390
Tomorrow, don't be late.

07:28.470 --> 07:29.720
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

07:29.800 --> 07:31.100
I know, I know.

07:31.180 --> 07:34.730
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.400
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

07:41.730 --> 07:43.990
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.150
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

07:45.240 --> 07:46.740
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

07:46.860 --> 07:47.860
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:47.950 --> 07:49.870
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

07:49.950 --> 07:51.790
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.700
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.370
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

07:56.460 --> 07:57.670
"The Merchant of Death"?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.290
That's not bad.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.170
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

08:03.420 --> 08:05.800
Well, Ms. Brown,

08:06.380 --> 08:08.340
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

08:08.430 --> 08:11.140
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

08:11.220 --> 08:13.390
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

08:13.470 --> 08:14.560
Rehearse that much?

08:14.640 --> 08:16.310
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

08:16.390 --> 08:18.730
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.060
All I want is a serious answer.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.400
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

08:23.480 --> 08:25.900
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

08:25.990 --> 08:28.240
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.120
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.789
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

08:33.870 --> 08:35.080
would call that being a hero.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.330
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.580
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

08:39.669 --> 08:41.419
by advancing medical technology

08:41.500 --> 08:43.840
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

08:43.919 --> 08:47.170
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.680
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

08:50.760 --> 08:52.680
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.530
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

09:08.610 --> 09:12.280
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

09:12.490 --> 09:15.790
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

09:15.870 --> 09:18.330
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

09:35.350 --> 09:36.640
Tony?

09:38.060 --> 09:39.390
Hey, Tony?

10:01.160 --> 10:03.460
You are not authorized
to access this area.

10:03.580 --> 10:06.290
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

10:06.790 --> 10:09.420
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

10:09.510 --> 10:11.260
and there's a car waiting for you outside

10:11.340 --> 10:13.640
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

10:13.970 --> 10:17.470
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

10:19.060 --> 10:22.980
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

10:23.060 --> 10:26.400
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

10:26.480 --> 10:29.280
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.440
Will that be all?

10:47.420 --> 10:49.000
Give me an exploded view.

10:49.090 --> 10:52.340
The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.970
Log that.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.810
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

10:59.890 --> 11:00.890
I'll keep you posted.

11:00.970 --> 11:02.730
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

11:02.810 --> 11:05.190
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.810
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.610
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

11:08.690 --> 11:10.820
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

11:10.900 --> 11:12.440
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

11:12.530 --> 11:14.280
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

11:14.360 --> 11:15.450
before I get you out of the door.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.780
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

11:17.870 --> 11:19.080
if it departs before you arrive?

11:19.160 --> 11:22.540
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.250
Do you want it? Yes or no.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.420
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

11:27.210 --> 11:29.710
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

11:29.790 --> 11:31.050
where he lived and worked,

11:31.130 --> 11:32.630
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

11:32.710 --> 11:37.090
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

11:37.970 --> 11:40.560
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.890
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

11:43.980 --> 11:46.770
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

11:46.850 --> 11:49.270
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.860
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.280
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.280
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

11:54.360 --> 11:56.900
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.030
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.620
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.160
I knew that. Already?

12:02.240 --> 12:05.830
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

12:06.710 --> 12:09.290
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.840
- And?
- It was very nice.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.380
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

12:16.050 --> 12:18.180
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

12:21.350 --> 12:22.350
Okay.

12:40.740 --> 12:44.330
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

12:44.950 --> 12:48.920
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.540
I got you. I got you.

12:50.630 --> 12:52.040
What's wrong with you?

12:52.130 --> 12:53.670
- What?
- Three hours.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.880
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.970
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

12:58.050 --> 13:00.590
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.220
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

13:11.270 --> 13:13.860
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.150
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.950
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

13:19.030 --> 13:20.490
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

13:20.570 --> 13:21.700
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

13:21.780 --> 13:22.820
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

13:22.910 --> 13:24.280
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

13:24.370 --> 13:25.580
You don't respect yourself,

13:25.660 --> 13:27.040
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.450
I'm just your babysitter.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.040
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.330
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

13:33.420 --> 13:35.040
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

13:35.130 --> 13:36.550
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

13:36.630 --> 13:38.380
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.880
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

13:40.970 --> 13:42.550
incapable of being responsible.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.180
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

13:45.260 --> 13:46.310
Hot sake?

13:46.390 --> 13:49.730
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

13:49.810 --> 13:51.140
That's what I'm talking about.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.270
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

13:54.360 --> 13:56.150
you know what I recognize?

13:56.230 --> 14:01.450
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

14:01.530 --> 14:04.240
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

14:04.320 --> 14:07.410
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

14:07.490 --> 14:09.330
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

14:09.410 --> 14:12.500
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

14:29.180 --> 14:30.140
General.

14:30.220 --> 14:33.810
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.900
Thanks.

14:36.810 --> 14:39.690
Is it better to be feared or respected?

14:39.860 --> 14:42.950
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

14:43.860 --> 14:46.780
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

14:46.870 --> 14:48.660
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

14:48.740 --> 14:49.790
It's the first missile system

14:49.870 --> 14:52.750
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

14:52.830 --> 14:56.790
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.840
I respectfully disagree.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.970
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

15:03.220 --> 15:06.430
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.350
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.770
Find an excuse

15:10.850 --> 15:14.140
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

15:14.230 --> 15:17.770
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

15:36.250 --> 15:40.040
For your consideration, the Jericho.

15:51.640 --> 15:52.640
I'll be throwing one of these in

15:52.720 --> 15:54.730
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

15:54.810 --> 15:55.850
To peace!

15:57.600 --> 15:59.650
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

15:59.730 --> 16:02.190
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.110
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

16:04.190 --> 16:08.070
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

16:08.160 --> 16:09.620
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.280
Good night, Tony.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.160
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

16:15.250 --> 16:17.210
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

16:17.290 --> 16:20.000
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.150
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

18:05.730 --> 18:07.530
What the hell did you do to me?

18:08.360 --> 18:09.900
What I did?

18:11.150 --> 18:12.950
What I did is to save your life.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.830
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

18:16.910 --> 18:18.740
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

18:19.450 --> 18:21.250
Here, want to see?

18:21.910 --> 18:24.750
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.630
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

18:29.710 --> 18:32.130
We call them the walking dead

18:32.220 --> 18:35.390
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

18:35.470 --> 18:38.260
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

18:39.060 --> 18:41.180
hooked up to a car battery,

18:41.270 --> 18:44.190
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.530
That's right. Smile.

18:56.240 --> 19:00.370
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

19:00.910 --> 19:03.460
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

19:03.790 --> 19:06.880
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

19:06.960 --> 19:10.130
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

19:10.210 --> 19:11.550
Where are we?

19:13.470 --> 19:15.380
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

19:16.340 --> 19:18.390
Just do as I do.

19:19.060 --> 19:21.140
Come on, put your hands up.

19:22.890 --> 19:24.350
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.810
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

19:47.290 --> 19:51.500
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

19:51.590 --> 19:53.420
"in the history of America."

19:56.840 --> 19:58.390
He is honored.

20:00.850 --> 20:02.680
He wants you to build the missile.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.390
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.150
This one.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.200
I refuse.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Tony!

21:19.010 --> 21:21.340
He wants to know what you think.

21:22.300 --> 21:24.100
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

21:33.060 --> 21:37.190
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

21:37.820 --> 21:39.950
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

21:43.160 --> 21:45.780
He says for you
to start working immediately,

21:45.870 --> 21:49.120
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

21:52.630 --> 21:55.170
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

22:08.770 --> 22:11.350
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

22:11.440 --> 22:14.520
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

22:16.150 --> 22:19.900
Look, what you just saw,

22:20.690 --> 22:22.820
that is your legacy, Stark.

22:24.410 --> 22:27.790
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

22:27.870 --> 22:30.160
Is that how you want to go out?

22:30.700 --> 22:35.670
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

22:36.380 --> 22:37.960
Or are you going to
do something about it?

22:38.050 --> 22:43.180
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

22:43.260 --> 22:46.510
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.970
Well, then,

22:48.560 --> 22:51.680
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

22:54.480 --> 22:57.980
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

22:58.230 --> 23:01.280
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.530
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

23:03.610 --> 23:06.660
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

23:20.050 --> 23:22.460
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

23:22.550 --> 23:25.260
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

23:25.340 --> 23:27.390
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

23:27.470 --> 23:30.890
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

23:32.060 --> 23:36.350
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.060
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

23:48.450 --> 23:49.910
You know, we might be more productive

23:49.990 --> 23:52.790
if you include me
in the planning process.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.590
Okay, we don't need this.

24:05.550 --> 24:07.010
What is that?

24:08.510 --> 24:10.850
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

24:11.470 --> 24:14.930
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

24:17.600 --> 24:19.520
What's he doing?

24:20.060 --> 24:21.440
Working.

24:31.490 --> 24:34.450
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

24:34.540 --> 24:37.250
Relax. I have steady hands.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.750
Why do you think you're still alive?

24:47.010 --> 24:50.390
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.310
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.020
Nice to meet you, too.

25:36.060 --> 25:38.350
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.900
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

25:42.230 --> 25:45.020
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.110
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.860
But what could it generate?

25:49.950 --> 25:54.530
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

25:54.990 --> 25:57.450
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

25:57.540 --> 26:00.620
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

26:09.590 --> 26:12.970
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

26:14.470 --> 26:16.050
Flatten them out and look.

26:18.600 --> 26:19.600
Oh, wow.

26:22.690 --> 26:24.270
Impressive.

26:50.340 --> 26:52.260
Good.

26:52.340 --> 26:55.010
Good roll. Good roll.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.680
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.600
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.100
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

27:04.440 --> 27:08.820
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

27:09.610 --> 27:11.240
And you, Stark?

27:15.320 --> 27:17.530
- No.
- No?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.910
So you're a man who has everything

27:22.620 --> 27:23.960
and nothing.

28:09.590 --> 28:12.670
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.340
Maybe it's been modified.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.470
The tail is wrong.

28:15.550 --> 28:16.550
It's just backwards.

29:02.390 --> 29:03.560
Relax.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.860
The bow and arrow

29:14.940 --> 29:17.820
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.780
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

29:23.580 --> 29:26.580
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.920
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

29:32.040 --> 29:35.590
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

29:39.220 --> 29:40.550
But today,

29:41.390 --> 29:44.760
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

29:45.810 --> 29:47.680
rules these lands.

29:50.020 --> 29:51.400
And soon,

29:54.360 --> 29:56.110
it will be my turn.

30:09.290 --> 30:10.790
Why have you failed me?

30:11.620 --> 30:13.290
We're working.

30:13.790 --> 30:14.960
Diligently.

30:15.210 --> 30:16.960
I let you live.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.170
This is how you repay me?

30:21.840 --> 30:24.180
It's very complex.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.930
He's trying very hard.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.310
On his knees.

30:32.980 --> 30:34.650
You think I'm a fool?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.690
I'll get the truth.

30:37.440 --> 30:38.780
We're both working.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.370
Open your mouth.

30:47.700 --> 30:48.740
What does he want?

30:48.990 --> 30:51.120
You think I'm a fool?

30:54.960 --> 30:56.500
What's going on?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.500
Tell me the truth.

30:59.670 --> 31:01.170
He's building your Jericho.

31:04.220 --> 31:06.680
What do you want? A delivery date?

31:13.940 --> 31:15.310
I need him.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.980
Good assistant.

31:23.780 --> 31:27.780
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.930
Okay? Can you move?

32:35.430 --> 32:37.270
Okay, say it again.

32:37.350 --> 32:39.860
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

32:39.940 --> 32:43.440
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.370
Where is Stark?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.620
He was here a moment ago.

32:54.740 --> 32:55.830
Go look for him.

33:11.260 --> 33:14.140
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

33:14.640 --> 33:16.270
Say something.
Say something back to him.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.730
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

33:18.810 --> 33:21.310
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

33:44.590 --> 33:46.710
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

33:47.130 --> 33:48.760
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.470
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

33:51.840 --> 33:52.840
Okay.

33:53.890 --> 33:55.100
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

33:55.180 --> 33:58.810
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

33:59.180 --> 34:00.440
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

34:00.520 --> 34:01.650
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

34:01.730 --> 34:03.270
- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

34:03.360 --> 34:05.770
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

34:05.860 --> 34:07.610
Come over here and button me up.

34:10.650 --> 34:11.820
Okay. All right.

34:11.909 --> 34:13.239
Every other hex bolt.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.449
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

34:15.530 --> 34:16.909
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

34:19.370 --> 34:21.620
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

34:21.710 --> 34:23.460
We need more time.

34:24.670 --> 34:25.670
Hey,

34:26.460 --> 34:29.760
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

34:30.469 --> 34:31.880
Stick to the plan!

34:33.800 --> 34:35.050
Yinsen!

37:27.730 --> 37:30.190
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

37:45.240 --> 37:46.410
Stark.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.830
Come on. We got to go.

37:50.580 --> 37:53.460
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

37:53.540 --> 37:55.460
This was always the plan, Stark.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.090
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

37:59.590 --> 38:01.510
My family is dead.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.600
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

38:07.060 --> 38:08.470
It's okay.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.560
I want this. I want this.

38:19.570 --> 38:21.490
Thank you for saving me.

38:22.950 --> 38:26.950
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

39:05.990 --> 39:06.990
My turn.

40:50.600 --> 40:51.600
Not bad.

41:23.590 --> 41:24.920
Hey!

41:47.490 --> 41:49.400
How was the "fun-vee"?

41:51.700 --> 41:54.120
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

42:25.190 --> 42:26.940
Watch it, coming up here.

42:28.900 --> 42:32.030
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

42:40.290 --> 42:43.670
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

42:43.750 --> 42:48.380
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

42:50.090 --> 42:51.220
Where to, sir?

42:51.300 --> 42:52.930
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

42:53.010 --> 42:54.090
No? Tony, you have to

42:54.180 --> 42:55.180
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

42:55.260 --> 42:57.010
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.760
I've been in captivity for three months.

42:58.850 --> 43:02.600
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

43:02.690 --> 43:03.640
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

43:03.730 --> 43:06.150
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

43:06.230 --> 43:07.480
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

43:07.570 --> 43:10.110
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

43:22.580 --> 43:24.330
Look at this!

43:26.210 --> 43:27.420
Tony.

43:29.750 --> 43:32.590
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

43:32.670 --> 43:34.090
Look at you!

43:34.840 --> 43:37.220
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

43:37.300 --> 43:39.760
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

43:42.770 --> 43:45.560
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

43:50.940 --> 43:52.400
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

43:52.490 --> 43:53.740
Can I speak to you for a moment?

43:53.820 --> 43:57.450
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

43:57.530 --> 43:58.870
I'm not a reporter.

43:58.950 --> 44:00.370
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

44:00.450 --> 44:02.200
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

44:02.290 --> 44:03.870
and Logistics Division.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.710
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

44:06.790 --> 44:11.210
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

44:11.300 --> 44:14.970
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

44:15.050 --> 44:18.720
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

44:18.800 --> 44:22.100
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.480
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

44:29.560 --> 44:32.980
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

44:33.190 --> 44:35.280
A little less formal and...

44:40.120 --> 44:42.830
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

44:42.910 --> 44:44.950
I don't know what he's up to.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.460
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

44:47.540 --> 44:50.000
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

44:50.210 --> 44:52.960
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.050
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

44:58.130 --> 45:01.180
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

45:02.680 --> 45:05.560
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

45:06.480 --> 45:10.770
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

45:15.110 --> 45:17.240
I saw young Americans killed

45:18.110 --> 45:22.160
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

45:23.580 --> 45:24.950
And I saw

45:26.160 --> 45:30.960
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

45:31.040 --> 45:33.040
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

45:33.750 --> 45:35.760
What happened over there?

45:36.630 --> 45:40.300
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

45:40.380 --> 45:44.760
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

45:44.850 --> 45:48.310
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

45:48.390 --> 45:52.060
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

45:52.150 --> 45:56.150
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

45:56.230 --> 45:57.820
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

45:57.900 --> 45:59.650
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

45:59.740 --> 46:03.780
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

46:05.120 --> 46:09.910
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

46:10.370 --> 46:12.710
And he's healthier than ever.

46:13.080 --> 46:16.170
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

46:16.250 --> 46:18.670
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.140
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

46:34.060 --> 46:36.860
Well, that... That went well.

46:36.940 --> 46:39.360
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

46:39.440 --> 46:41.780
Your head? What about my head?

46:41.860 --> 46:44.910
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

46:45.030 --> 46:48.080
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

46:48.450 --> 46:49.450
Yep.

46:49.790 --> 46:53.040
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.790
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

46:55.880 --> 46:58.500
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

46:58.590 --> 46:59.710
It's my name on the side of the building.

46:59.800 --> 47:02.430
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

47:02.510 --> 47:04.470
Not based on what I saw.

47:05.720 --> 47:06.720
We're not doing a good enough job.

47:06.800 --> 47:08.060
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

47:08.140 --> 47:11.020
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

47:12.020 --> 47:15.270
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

47:15.350 --> 47:19.690
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

47:20.030 --> 47:23.150
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

47:23.240 --> 47:26.370
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

47:26.820 --> 47:30.120
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

47:30.200 --> 47:33.370
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

47:33.460 --> 47:34.620
Maybe.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.630
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

47:37.710 --> 47:40.250
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

47:42.880 --> 47:45.090
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

47:45.180 --> 47:48.430
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

47:48.510 --> 47:50.850
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

47:59.230 --> 48:00.730
- Okay.
- Okay?

48:04.030 --> 48:05.280
It works.

48:09.330 --> 48:13.500
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

48:13.580 --> 48:16.830
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

48:16.920 --> 48:18.330
like your father and I.

48:18.420 --> 48:20.210
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

48:20.290 --> 48:21.880
- But if I had...
- Tony.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.970
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

48:25.050 --> 48:27.800
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

48:28.390 --> 48:30.550
You gotta let me handle this.

48:30.640 --> 48:33.060
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

48:33.140 --> 48:34.980
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

48:35.060 --> 48:38.310
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.310
Stark Industries!

48:40.400 --> 48:43.280
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

48:43.360 --> 48:44.530
Sell, sell, sell!

48:44.740 --> 48:46.700
Abandon ship!

48:46.780 --> 48:50.160
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

48:51.530 --> 48:56.460
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

48:58.080 --> 49:02.040
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

49:02.590 --> 49:05.420
Pepper. How big are your hands?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.130
- What?
- How big are your hands?

49:08.220 --> 49:11.100
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

49:18.480 --> 49:19.560
Hey.

49:21.610 --> 49:24.110
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

49:24.190 --> 49:25.190
Let's see them.

49:25.570 --> 49:27.610
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

49:28.570 --> 49:31.120
I just need your help for a sec.

49:31.910 --> 49:34.080
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

49:34.160 --> 49:36.750
It was. It is now an antique.

49:37.540 --> 49:40.330
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

49:40.420 --> 49:45.050
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.050
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

49:48.130 --> 49:51.510
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

49:51.590 --> 49:54.720
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

49:54.810 --> 49:56.470
It's fine.

49:57.350 --> 49:59.270
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

49:59.350 --> 50:01.150
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

50:01.230 --> 50:05.520
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.400
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

50:08.490 --> 50:10.110
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

50:10.200 --> 50:11.570
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

50:11.660 --> 50:14.120
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

50:14.200 --> 50:18.250
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.580
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

50:22.670 --> 50:26.710
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

50:26.800 --> 50:30.340
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

50:31.590 --> 50:33.550
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

50:33.640 --> 50:36.310
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

50:36.390 --> 50:37.510
Okay.

50:41.850 --> 50:43.440
Oh, there's pus!

50:43.520 --> 50:48.150
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

50:48.230 --> 50:50.150
- not from my body.
- It smells!

50:50.240 --> 50:51.780
Yeah, it does.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.820
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

50:54.910 --> 50:56.030
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

50:56.120 --> 50:59.040
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

50:59.120 --> 51:00.120
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:00.200 --> 51:01.540
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

51:01.620 --> 51:03.790
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

51:03.870 --> 51:06.790
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

51:06.880 --> 51:08.050
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

51:08.130 --> 51:10.300
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

51:10.380 --> 51:11.380
What's wrong?

51:11.470 --> 51:12.840
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

51:12.930 --> 51:14.220
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

51:14.300 --> 51:17.050
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

51:17.140 --> 51:19.140
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

51:19.430 --> 51:21.270
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

51:21.350 --> 51:22.310
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

51:22.390 --> 51:25.060
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

51:25.560 --> 51:29.730
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

51:33.780 --> 51:37.320
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

51:38.490 --> 51:39.540
Nice.

51:39.620 --> 51:41.870
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

51:41.950 --> 51:43.250
You okay?

51:44.670 --> 51:47.540
Don't ever, ever, ever,

51:47.630 --> 51:50.630
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

51:50.710 --> 51:52.840
I don't have anyone but you.

51:58.470 --> 51:59.470
Anyway...

52:05.350 --> 52:08.270
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

52:09.110 --> 52:10.440
Destroy it.

52:10.980 --> 52:12.480
Incinerate it.

52:13.150 --> 52:14.780
You don't want to keep it?

52:14.860 --> 52:19.030
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

52:19.580 --> 52:23.290
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

52:23.950 --> 52:25.710
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

52:25.790 --> 52:27.710
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

52:27.790 --> 52:31.000
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

52:31.090 --> 52:34.010
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

52:40.180 --> 52:44.480
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

52:44.770 --> 52:46.890
I'll tell you, in my experience,

52:46.980 --> 52:51.730
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

52:52.110 --> 52:53.360
his insight,

52:53.440 --> 52:56.450
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

52:56.530 --> 53:00.160
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.240
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

53:03.330 --> 53:05.330
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

53:05.410 --> 53:07.330
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

53:07.410 --> 53:09.250
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

53:09.330 --> 53:11.960
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.340
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

53:13.420 --> 53:14.800
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

53:14.880 --> 53:15.960
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

53:16.050 --> 53:17.300
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

53:17.380 --> 53:18.550
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

53:18.630 --> 53:21.600
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

53:24.520 --> 53:26.180
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

53:26.270 --> 53:29.020
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

53:29.140 --> 53:30.940
I'm doing a little better than walking.

53:31.020 --> 53:32.520
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:33.190 --> 53:35.860
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

53:36.030 --> 53:38.950
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

53:40.200 --> 53:42.660
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

53:42.740 --> 53:45.740
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

53:45.830 --> 53:47.410
that was a doozy.

53:47.790 --> 53:52.290
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

53:52.380 --> 53:55.050
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

53:55.130 --> 53:56.550
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

53:56.630 --> 54:00.550
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

54:02.390 --> 54:03.970
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

54:06.930 --> 54:09.100
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

54:09.180 --> 54:10.390
Thanks.

54:18.610 --> 54:22.030
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.200
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark II.

54:27.370 --> 54:31.080
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

54:31.370 --> 54:33.750
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

54:33.830 --> 54:36.670
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

54:36.750 --> 54:39.460
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

54:43.430 --> 54:46.510
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

54:48.640 --> 54:51.140
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

55:34.390 --> 55:37.150
Next. Up.

55:37.770 --> 55:40.650
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

55:40.730 --> 55:42.820
Stay put. Nice.

55:44.660 --> 55:48.490
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

55:48.950 --> 55:51.120
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

55:58.000 --> 55:59.170
Up.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.840
Screw it. Don't even move.

56:01.920 --> 56:05.010
You are a tragedy.

56:14.850 --> 56:17.440
Okay, let's do this right.

56:18.110 --> 56:20.940
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

56:23.690 --> 56:25.900
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

56:25.990 --> 56:27.410
You, roll it.

56:29.740 --> 56:33.290
Okay. Activate hand controls.

56:37.620 --> 56:38.790
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

56:38.880 --> 56:42.050
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

56:42.130 --> 56:43.510
And three,

56:44.340 --> 56:45.380
two,

56:46.170 --> 56:47.300
one.

57:24.380 --> 57:26.670
Up two. All right, set that.

57:26.760 --> 57:29.180
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

57:29.260 --> 57:31.090
Yeah, everything's... What?

57:31.180 --> 57:32.350
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

57:32.430 --> 57:34.430
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

57:34.930 --> 57:36.140
Okay.

57:36.930 --> 57:38.730
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

57:38.810 --> 57:39.810
It is.

57:40.310 --> 57:43.900
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

57:47.940 --> 57:49.150
I didn't expect that.

57:54.450 --> 57:55.870
How'd it go?

57:58.120 --> 57:59.790
It went that bad, huh?

57:59.870 --> 58:02.540
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

58:02.630 --> 58:06.510
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

58:06.590 --> 58:09.470
It would have gone better
if you were there.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.260
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

58:11.340 --> 58:15.890
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

58:16.970 --> 58:21.140
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

58:22.190 --> 58:24.650
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

58:24.730 --> 58:25.860
They're filing an injunction.

58:25.940 --> 58:27.980
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

58:28.070 --> 58:29.280
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

58:29.360 --> 58:30.360
We knew that was gonna happen.

58:30.450 --> 58:32.530
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

58:32.610 --> 58:34.830
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

58:34.910 --> 58:37.660
Tony, the board has rights, too.

58:38.540 --> 58:42.420
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

58:42.500 --> 58:44.750
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

58:44.840 --> 58:47.840
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

58:48.760 --> 58:52.630
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

58:52.720 --> 58:53.760
This is great.

58:53.840 --> 58:57.310
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

58:57.390 --> 58:59.600
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

58:59.680 --> 59:03.020
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

59:03.100 --> 59:04.690
Something to pitch them.

59:04.810 --> 59:08.280
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

59:08.360 --> 59:10.490
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

59:10.570 --> 59:12.150
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

59:12.240 --> 59:15.070
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

59:15.160 --> 59:16.990
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.580
- Take two.
- Thank you.

59:18.660 --> 59:20.540
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

59:20.620 --> 59:22.250
Good night, Obie.

59:22.870 --> 59:27.710
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

59:27.790 --> 59:30.460
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

59:30.550 --> 59:33.380
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

59:33.470 --> 59:35.300
All right, nice and easy.

59:35.390 --> 59:40.350
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

59:41.850 --> 59:43.940
And three, two, one.

59:55.740 --> 59:56.780
Okay.

59:58.070 --> 59:59.700
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.200
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:04.000
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.330
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:08.040
Three, two, one.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.190
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.610
Not the car, not the car!

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.940
Table!

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:46.160
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.810
No!

01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:09.520
Yeah, I can fly.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.240
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.570
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.700
Import all preferences
from home interface.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.240
Will do, sir.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.210
All right, what do you say?

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:34.800
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.510
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:39.590
Lmporting preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.970
Do a check on control surfaces.

01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.600
As you wish.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:07.040
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.040
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:11.630
Start listening in on ground control.

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:12.790
Sir, there are still terabytes

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.460
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:19.470
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:23.890
Ready? In three, two, one.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.950
Handles like a dream.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.650
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.150
What's SR-71's record?

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.030
The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:27.120
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:33.920
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.130
Keep going!

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.710
Higher!

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:56.650
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.780
Come on, we got to break the ice!

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.270
Kill power.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.860
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:10.360
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.700
A very astute observation, sir.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:14.530
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.080
we should improve the exosystems.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.750
Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:21.920
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.880
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.210
- Got it?
- Yes.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.630
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.090
Thrill me.

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:37.020
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:41.350
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:43.020
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.360
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.940
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:48.480
...hasn't been seen in public

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:52.320
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:55.160
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.870
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.080
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:04.330
The render is complete.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.090
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:09.260
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.510
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:16.510
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.560
The render is complete.

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.940
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:25.610
Commencing automated assembly.

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:28.860
Estimated completion time is five hours.

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:30.070
Don't wait up for me, honey.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:58.010
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.890
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.060
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:10.070
You look great, Hef.

01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:13.190
We're going to have a great quarter.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:17.029
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.330
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.160
I'll see you inside.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:27.000
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.840
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.510
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:40.600
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.060
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.729
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:49.149
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:50.859
God, you need a new name for that.

01:08:50.939 --> 01:08:52.939
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

01:08:53.740 --> 01:08:57.529
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

01:08:57.609 --> 01:08:59.569
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.529
and time can be a factor
with these things.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.660
Let's just put something on the books.

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:07.120
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
At Stark Industries?

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:10.750
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.170
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.720
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.050
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:22.930
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.850
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:27.060
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.390
Yes.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:30.399
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:32.979
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:45.660
Am I making you uncomfortable?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:51.290
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:55.210
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:58.050
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

01:09:58.130 --> 01:10:00.010
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:03.760
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:05.260
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:07.850
What's your Social Security number?

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.110
- Five.
- Five?

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.230
- Right.
- Right.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.650
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:20.950
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.590
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.470
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:43.390
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:44.850
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.720
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:49.980
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:53.440
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.320
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.650
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.110
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.160
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.120
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:09.120
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.000
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.840
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:32.690
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.980
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:41.780
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:45.700
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.950
Make one of them dirty, will you?

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:55.170
Wow. Tony Stark.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:57.840
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880
- Carrie.
- Christine.

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:03.970
That's right.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:06.720
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.220
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.720
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:12.180
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:13.600
involvement in this latest atrocity.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.230
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:18.690
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:21.150
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.570
Is this what you call accountability?

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:26.360
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.340
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.840
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:44.880
Well, I'm not my company.

01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:49.260
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:50.680
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.100
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.020
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.480
"This is how we do business."

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.770
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.360
Tony, your picture, please!

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:09.070
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.000
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:18.000
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.170
It was the only way I could protect you.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:26.760
No. No.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:39.100
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:42.900
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:45.990
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:47.780
have been driven from their homes,

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:52.120
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:55.450
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.330
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:02.250
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:10.430
Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:13.260
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:16.850
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:21.060
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.810
With no political will
or international pressure,

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.360
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:29.700
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:31.570
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:34.240
either forced to join their militia...

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.870
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:40.540
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:44.250
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.260
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:52.220
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:26.350
Hurry it up.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.650
Put the women in the trucks.

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:28.770
Stack the weapons here.

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.860
Clear all the houses.

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:31.610
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780
Grab that dog.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:45.870
Put him with the others.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.090
What the hell is this?

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:11.610
Shoot this dog.

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:13.360
You're all incompetent.

01:17:16.650 --> 01:17:17.700
Turn your head.

01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:26.180
He's all yours.

01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:26.990
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.160
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.950
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.710
Get those monitors up!

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:34.120
We got a bogey!

01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:36.340
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:38.380
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:40.130
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.880
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:44.470
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:46.800
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:49.560
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.110
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

01:19:58.190 --> 01:19:59.900
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.190
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.990
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:05.740
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:07.200
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.240
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

01:20:09.330 --> 01:20:11.500
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.960
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.870
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:21.380
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

01:20:24.930 --> 01:20:26.720
- Hello?
- Tony?

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.550
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.890
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:33.850
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:37.400
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.860
It's funny how that works, huh?

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.320
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.070
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.780
Well, that's a hot spot.

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:48.370
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:49.530
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:50.830
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.700
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:54.580
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:57.000
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.580
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

01:20:58.670 --> 01:21:01.420
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.880
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:07.340
That's my exit.

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:15.520
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.140
Whiplash One, what is it?

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:18.560
I've got no idea.

01:21:18.650 --> 01:21:20.980
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.150
Then you are clear to engage.

01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:25.190
Hit it.

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:33.040
That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.040
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.670
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.190
Deploy flaps!

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.610
Holy!

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:04.270
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.900
The sat visual has been lost.

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.650
No way that's a UAV.

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:08.900
What is it?

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.530
I can't see anything.

01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:13.080
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.200
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:27.260
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.010
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:30.380
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:31.970
No, see, this isn't a game.

01:22:32.050 --> 01:22:35.350
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.350
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:40.270
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:42.770
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:47.320
- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:50.700
On your belly!

01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.660
It looks like a man!

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:55.530
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:04.710
I'm hit! I'm hit!

01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:07.130
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:13.260
Punch out! Punch out!

01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.390
Whiplash One down.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.060
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:25.400
Negative! No chute, no chute!

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:32.320
My chute's jammed!

01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:40.660
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:43.370
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.750
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.920
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

01:23:50.010 --> 01:23:51.340
inside a legal no fly zone!

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:53.760
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.220
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.680
Keep going!

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:07.310
Good chute! Good chute!

01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:17.780
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:20.450
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:22.700
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:26.920
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.590
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:31.550
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:33.260
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:35.840
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

01:24:35.930 --> 01:24:37.680
It's not that simple.

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:40.310
An unfortunate training exercise

01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:43.270
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:47.400
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.400
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:54.990
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:59.240
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.370
Hey!

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:06.120
It is a tight fit, sir.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:10.000
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:12.050
Be gentle. This is my first time.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.760
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:20.760
- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:24.600
What's going on here?

01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:33.230
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.650
Are those bullet holes?

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.350
Welcome.

01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:09.810
Compliments of Tony Stark.

01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:14.400
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.570
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:18.450
Show me the weapon.

01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:23.160
Come. Leave your guards outside.

01:26:39.930 --> 01:26:42.470
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:47.100
So this is how he did it.

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:49.940
This is only a first, crude effort.

01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.440
Stark has perfected his design.

01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:55.360
He has made a masterpiece of death.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:59.190
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:03.160
And you dream of Stark's throne.

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:07.200
We have a common enemy.

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:13.460
If we are still in business,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.210
I will give you these designs

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:20.720
as a gift.

01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:23.760
And in turn,

01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:30.560
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.490
This is the only gift you shall receive.

01:27:47.490 --> 01:27:48.870
Technology.

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.250
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:58.630
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:02.260
That's the least of your problems.

01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:10.140
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:13.810
All right, let's finish up here.

01:28:17.770 --> 01:28:20.690
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.320
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.280
I want a prototype right away.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:37.630
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:39.960
I need you to go to my office.

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.880
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.550
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:47.220
This'll get you in.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.890
It's probably under Executive Files.

01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:51.390
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:54.140
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:56.900
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.060
Same drill.

01:28:58.150 --> 01:29:00.150
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:03.320
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:05.320
Tony,

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:09.530
you know that
I would help you with anything,

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:13.580
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.290
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:20.750
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:24.970
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

01:29:26.170 --> 01:29:27.510
Is that so?

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.180
Well, then, I quit.

01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:35.890
You stood by my side all these years

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:38.810
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:40.940
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:42.860
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:47.400
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

01:29:47.490 --> 01:29:49.490
I shouldn't be alive,

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.910
unless it was for a reason.

01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:55.620
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.290
I just finally know what I have to do.

01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:06.420
And I know in my heart that it's right.

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:24.570
You're all I have, too, you know.

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:38.970
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:56.200
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.830
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

01:31:57.910 --> 01:32:00.620
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.420
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:11.840
So, what are we going to do about this?

01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:27.110
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:38.530
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:04.520
I was so happy when he came home.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:07.400
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:12.400
Now I realize,

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.990
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:22.410
He left a part of himself in that cave.

01:33:25.210 --> 01:33:26.790
Breaks my heart.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:33.090
Well, he's a complicated person.

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.180
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.270
You are a very rare woman.

01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:52.940
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

01:33:55.650 --> 01:33:57.650
Thank you. Thanks.

01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:01.700
I'd better get back there.

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:09.210
Is that today's paper?

01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:11.920
Yes.

01:34:12.670 --> 01:34:14.090
Do you mind?

01:34:14.670 --> 01:34:16.510
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:17.920
Of course.

01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:22.720
Take care.

01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:49.750
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:51.370
Nope, right now. Come with me.

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:52.580
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:54.460
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:57.760
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:02.180
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:06.100
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:08.980
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:11.310
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:13.100
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

01:35:13.190 --> 01:35:17.030
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:20.360
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:26.450
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:30.500
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:37.210
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:42.470
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

01:35:58.570 --> 01:35:59.570
Tony?

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.620
Tony, are you there? Hello?

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.410
Breathe.

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:12.330
Easy, easy.

01:36:14.420 --> 01:36:16.710
You remember this one, right?

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:20.710
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.930
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:28.550
Tony.

01:36:30.850 --> 01:36:35.230
When I ordered the hit on you,

01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:40.320
I worried that I was

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.410
killing the golden goose.

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.490
But, you see, it was just

01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:54.120
fate that you survived that.

01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:03.050
You had one last golden egg to give.

01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:12.520
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.570
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:25.900
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:37.540
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:37:40.170 --> 01:37:45.010
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.760
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:52.890
This is your legacy.

01:37:55.430 --> 01:38:00.650
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:07.570
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

01:38:07.650 --> 01:38:09.910
put the balance of power in our hands.

01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:13.120
The right hands.

01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:20.790
I wish you could see my prototype.

01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:23.710
It's not as...

01:38:25.050 --> 01:38:28.050
Well, not as conservative as yours.

01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:32.890
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:35.930
I would have preferred that she lived.

01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:51.240
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:53.950
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.490
Okay, where's Tony now?

01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.290
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:00.500
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:03.210
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:10.820
Good boy.

01:40:50.650 --> 01:40:51.730
Tony?

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.490
Tony?

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:58.370
Tony?

01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:01.620
Tony?

01:41:04.290 --> 01:41:05.370
Tony!

01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:09.880
Tony! You okay?

01:41:10.210 --> 01:41:13.840
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.260
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:18.510
That's not going to be enough.

01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:48.330
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:00.010
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

01:42:00.090 --> 01:42:02.260
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:03.760
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

01:42:03.850 --> 01:42:06.600
You might want to take
a few steps back.

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.710
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:30.580
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.630
You need me to do anything else?

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:42.010
Keep the skies clear.

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.430
Damn!

01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.150
Next time, baby.

01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:31.640
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:34.230
I thought it'd be bigger.

01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:20.230
Take him out!

01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:32.960
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:35.330
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:38.130
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:39.750
Keep me posted.

01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:42.510
Pepper!

01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:45.590
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:47.600
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:49.470
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.020
Get out of there right now!

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:05.200
Where do you think you're going?

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:13.700
Your services are no longer required.

01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:15.370
Stane!

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.230
I love this suit!

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.570
- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:49.160
Divert power to chest RT.

01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:00.000
Power reduced to 19%.

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.970
Lady!

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.890
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:37.910
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:44.840
I built this company from nothing!

01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:49.680
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

01:46:55.930 --> 01:46:58.480
Least of all you!

01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:11.160
Lmpressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.450
I've made some upgrades of my own!

01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:24.750
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.500
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:28.880
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:31.130
I know the math! Do it!

01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:41.730
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:44.440
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

01:47:47.150 --> 01:47:50.150
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.490
Yes, sir.

01:47:59.450 --> 01:48:01.370
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:07.420
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

01:48:14.130 --> 01:48:16.260
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:17.970
Stop telling me!

01:48:27.650 --> 01:48:32.240
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.860
How'd you solve the icing problem?

01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:36.450
Icing problem?

01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.990
Might want to look into it.

01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:54.010
Two percent.

01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:59.010
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:14.110
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:18.320
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:19.830
Nice try!

01:49:32.380 --> 01:49:36.510
- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:42.350
Flares!

01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:52.900
Very clever, Tony.

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.700
- Potts?
- Tony!

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:01.780
This isn't working.

01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:04.160
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:07.120
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:09.670
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:11.170
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

01:50:11.250 --> 01:50:13.840
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:15.300
It's going to fry everything up here.

01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:19.760
Okay. I'm going in now.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.100
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

01:50:32.610 --> 01:50:34.440
This looks important!

01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:58.090
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

01:50:58.170 --> 01:51:02.300
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:13.060
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:17.570
You'd have made your father proud!

01:51:22.530 --> 01:51:25.030
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:45.890
Tony!

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.720
How ironic, Tony!

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.440
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

01:51:55.690 --> 01:52:01.570
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:08.450
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:12.540
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:17.170
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:21.760
Push it!

01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:21.110
Tony!

01:53:29.530 --> 01:53:31.660
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

01:53:31.740 --> 01:53:34.040
at Stark Industries last night.

01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:38.920
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.630
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.590
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:46.590
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:50.350
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:53.060
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:54.810
Here's your alibi.

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:56.730
Okay.

01:53:56.810 --> 01:53:58.980
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:01.190
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:02.980
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

01:54:03.070 --> 01:54:06.190
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.070
alone on the island.

01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:10.660
- That's what happened.
- All right.

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:12.870
Just read it, word for word.

01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:16.790
There's nothing about Stane here.

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:19.670
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:23.000
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:25.590
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:28.590
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.970
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:35.060
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:37.390
You've got 90 seconds.

01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:41.940
Agent Coulson?

01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:47.110
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

01:54:47.190 --> 01:54:50.110
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:53.740
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.240
Right.

01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.120
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

01:55:00.210 --> 01:55:02.500
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:04.130
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

01:55:04.210 --> 01:55:06.670
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.760
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:13.390
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

01:55:13.470 --> 01:55:15.850
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

01:55:15.930 --> 01:55:19.680
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:22.440
crazy about me.

01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:24.190
Tell me you never think about that night.

01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:26.150
- What night?
- You know.

01:55:29.070 --> 01:55:34.870
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:42.080
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:45.420
and you left me there, by myself?

01:55:46.630 --> 01:55:49.170
Is that the night you're talking about?

01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:52.430
Thought so.

01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:58.890
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

01:55:58.970 --> 01:56:02.520
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:05.650
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:14.950
Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:19.950
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.330
on the freeway and the rooftop...

01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:24.210
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

01:56:24.290 --> 01:56:28.040
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

01:56:28.130 --> 01:56:31.210
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:34.930
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:38.260
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

01:56:38.350 --> 01:56:39.970
I never said you were a superhero.

01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:45.400
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.650
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

01:56:51.190 --> 01:56:54.150
With this laundry list
of character defects,

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:55.700
all the mistakes I've made,

01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:59.120
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.870
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.500
The truth is

01:57:10.670 --> 01:57:12.170
I am Iron Man.

02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:16.660
Jarvis!

02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:18.490
Welcome home, sir.

02:05:21.910 --> 02:05:27.420
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:31.000
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:32.880
You just don't know it yet.

02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:35.170
Who the hell are you?

02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:38.090
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:05:40.180 --> 02:05:43.180
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
