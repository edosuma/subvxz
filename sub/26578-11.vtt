WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:02.329
Ah, thanks for the driving lesson.

00:02.330 --> 00:04.499
- Sorry about my language.
- That's okay, Mrs. Cleary.

00:04.500 --> 00:06.249
I live near a construction site.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.000
I just think it's exciting
that you're taking this step

00:08.020 --> 00:09.520
towards your independence as a woman.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.480
I'm learning to drive as a
person, not as a woman.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.560
If I were learning as a woman,

00:12.580 --> 00:14.820
I'd have you teach me
how to drive badly.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.059
That's one of Mike's jokes.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.720
Which is why I'm not
letting him teach me.

00:18.290 --> 00:20.640
- Welcome home, ladies.
- Oh, jeez, Frank,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.420
you're always somewhere.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.580
Wendi, I heard you went to that
Germaine Greer book-signing.

00:25.620 --> 00:26.879
Have you read "The Female Eunuch"?

00:26.880 --> 00:29.520
Sadly, I can't. That's in the
adult section at the library.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.120
I only have the light blue card.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.960
- Well, you can borrow mine.
- Thank you.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.420
Just please don't tell Mrs.
Cryer, the head librarian.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.240
She holds me in such high regard.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.030
The most dangerous thing around my house

00:39.040 --> 00:40.580
growing up wasn't the power mower

00:40.600 --> 00:42.410
or the asbestos in the ceiling.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.220
It was a bored Cleary boy
looking to stir things up.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.000
She's such a nice girl.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.610
Exactly. Not my type at all.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.740
But I could have used some lab goggles,

00:52.760 --> 00:54.520
'cause you two have real chemistry.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.660
What? That's crazy.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.080
Come on, the old
"lendy-loo" with the book?

00:59.100 --> 01:01.100
She made up an excuse to see you again.

01:01.140 --> 01:05.400
So you can exchange thoughts.
And perhaps, saliva.

01:05.510 --> 01:07.670
Stop. That's disgusting.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.979
But... really? You think?

01:08.980 --> 01:10.540
Who's up for some SAT prep?

01:10.550 --> 01:12.740
That's a "rhetorical" question, right?

01:12.800 --> 01:14.370
See? No need to study.

01:14.380 --> 01:17.040
Can you believe someone threw this away?

01:17.060 --> 01:18.250
It doesn't even have a shade.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.170
We have a little saying
in the garbage game...

01:20.180 --> 01:21.740
the alley will provide.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.870
Your friends on the truck
should have another saying...

01:23.880 --> 01:25.860
"I should have studied for the SATs."

01:25.880 --> 01:28.540
It's just a summer job, but it rules.

01:28.550 --> 01:32.000
I'm outside. It's exercise.
I'm cleaning up this town.

01:32.010 --> 01:35.500
I'm like a superhero...
Garbage Man! Or...

01:35.510 --> 01:37.410
Trash Man?

01:37.420 --> 01:39.160
Which do you like?

01:39.200 --> 01:42.960
I prefer your secret identity,
mild-mannered Eddie

01:42.970 --> 01:45.370
who wants to get into
Berkeley with his girlfriend.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.210
I need you to take the SAT this summer

01:47.220 --> 01:49.000
so you can take it again in the fall

01:49.010 --> 01:50.900
- and maybe get your score up.
- Assuming I don't get

01:50.920 --> 01:52.580
a perfect score first time out.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.250
Yeah, let's take that leap.

01:54.260 --> 01:55.600
Now, can we please study?

01:55.620 --> 01:58.420
Ugh, I've been up since 6:00 a.m.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.680
Want to make out by the
light of the garbage lamp?

02:02.680 --> 02:04.670
This is the third time
I've been over this week,

02:04.680 --> 02:06.250
and I can't get you
to focus on the test.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.330
It's like a million years from now.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.550
It's 11 days.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.539
I should probably register.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.670
What? It's too late!

02:14.680 --> 02:16.380
Now I'm really annoyed.

02:16.420 --> 02:17.680
I'm starting to feel like

02:17.690 --> 02:19.440
I care more about your
future than you do.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.259
- I can't make you do this, Eddie.
- That's a relief.

02:22.260 --> 02:24.740
It's not a relief. It's a big problem.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.140
Maybe we just go to city
college for a while.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.899
No way. I want to get out of here

02:28.900 --> 02:30.500
and do something with my life.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.620
I heard they have a class
that goes to a real farm.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.419
We shouldn't even be
talking about Wendi.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.620
She's Eddie's girlfriend.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.220
But you two are such a better match.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.300
She may be dating Eddie
just to get close to you.

02:44.410 --> 02:45.650
I know that's what I'd do.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.610
If you were interested in
me, you would date Eddie?

02:47.620 --> 02:49.900
100%. It's the smart play.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.520
Huh. This is starting to
make a lot of sense now.

02:57.330 --> 02:58.770
Hey! Where are you going?

02:58.780 --> 03:00.820
That's exactly what I'm asking myself.

03:00.830 --> 03:02.720
I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.060
I totally do. Just explain
again what it is,

03:05.070 --> 03:06.820
- and I'll want it.
- You can't do it for me.

03:06.830 --> 03:08.180
You've got to want it for yourself.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.110
Then I'll want it for myself,
if that's what you want.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.690
Eddie, I'm not going to
let you hold me back.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.040
I think we should take a break.

03:15.410 --> 03:17.360
For how long?

03:17.370 --> 03:20.580
I guess... for always?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.650
The smart, mature choice

03:22.660 --> 03:24.660
would be to face facts now and end this.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.380
I'm sorry.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:39.120 --> 03:41.940
Perfect time to make your move.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.029
I did it.

03:46.030 --> 03:47.980
I wrote it all down
in a letter to Wendi.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.230
A letter plays to your strengths.

03:49.240 --> 03:50.860
People like you more when
you're not in the room.

03:50.880 --> 03:51.940
Oh, totally!

03:51.960 --> 03:53.730
Plus, I'd get nervous if I
had to pour my heart out

03:53.740 --> 03:56.560
- like this in person.
- Sounds juicy.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.119
"Dear Wendi, Statistics
show college graduates earn

04:00.120 --> 04:04.360
on average 52% more than their
non-college counterparts."

04:04.410 --> 04:07.000
- You don't mess around, do you?
- There's more. Keep reading.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.590
"And as a fellow honors student... "

04:08.600 --> 04:09.859
Enough with the brainy stuff.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.440
- Talk about your bod.
- You think?

04:11.450 --> 04:13.360
And don't forget your
other accomplishments...

04:13.370 --> 04:15.150
don't you know how to use nunchucks?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.380
Plus I just got an award for penmanship.

04:17.420 --> 04:20.149
She's got eyes. She'll
see that for herself.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.180
Hey, Mom. Mom.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.620
We decided we want to camp
out in the yard tonight.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.839
Oh, a do-it-yourself vacation.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.480
I like the resourcefulness,

04:31.560 --> 04:32.619
and the price tag.

04:32.620 --> 04:35.150
Fine, but I want somebody
keeping an eye on you.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.980
Other than the weird guy who
lives in the apartment building.

04:36.990 --> 04:39.320
I'm the oldest. I'll keep everyone safe.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.040
In that case, take this.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.700
Coming, Andy!

04:50.530 --> 04:52.059
Oh, Hells bells,

04:52.060 --> 04:54.380
is Weepy Magee still
milking that breakup?

04:54.420 --> 04:56.160
It was only 20 minutes ago.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.240
And what's this gonna do to my
friendship with Wendi, huh?

04:58.260 --> 04:59.480
Did Eddie even think about that

04:59.500 --> 05:00.940
before he went and got himself dumped?

05:00.950 --> 05:02.550
Does that kid ever think about anything?

05:02.990 --> 05:04.880
You should probably go talk to him.

05:04.990 --> 05:07.460
Please Peg, don't make
me go back in there.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.540
Eddie needs someone to
tell him he's a great guy

05:09.550 --> 05:12.160
and he'll find another girl
just as good as Wendi.

05:12.170 --> 05:14.290
He'll never believe it coming from me.

05:14.300 --> 05:16.640
"So allow me to close with
a few bullet points."

05:16.660 --> 05:18.560
"Future earning potential, check.

05:18.580 --> 05:20.860
16-inch vertical leap, check.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.750
I hope you will give
this romantic overture

05:22.760 --> 05:25.290
serious consideration and
respond in the affirmative.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.560
Best regards, Francis X. Cleary."

05:30.720 --> 05:32.560
Really?

05:33.090 --> 05:34.920
I almost feel sorry for her.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.790
Don't overthink this. Go
mail that letter now,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.330
then just wait for the
love to come pouring back.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.290
If I hurry, I can make the last pickup.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.580
- I can't thank you enough.
- Seeing how this plays out

05:43.590 --> 05:45.290
will be all the thanks I need.

05:52.470 --> 05:53.720
How ya doing, sport?

05:53.800 --> 05:55.210
So bad!

05:55.220 --> 05:57.160
I just keep thinking about...

05:57.170 --> 06:00.150
I just keep thinking about that
Dodger game last night, huh?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.870
Manny Mota, he sure came through.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.420
He always comes off
the bench pretty hot.

06:05.430 --> 06:06.870
Wendi always says...

06:06.880 --> 06:08.760
Let me tell you a little story.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.960
During the war, there was
a certain "mademoiselle"

06:15.970 --> 06:20.330
outside of Paris named Sandrine
who I was very sweet on.

06:20.340 --> 06:21.960
But she threw me aside

06:22.020 --> 06:24.540
for this fast-talking
hilljack from West Virginia.

06:25.620 --> 06:28.319
I'd like to bump into
that clown some day.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.780
Is that it?

06:29.880 --> 06:33.160
My point is, there's
other fish in the sea.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.040
So you just got to get
back on that horse and...

06:38.590 --> 06:39.820
... and fish.

06:41.050 --> 06:42.750
Sutton's pitching tomorrow.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.040
What time are you done with the garbage?

06:44.050 --> 06:47.620
Oh, I couldn't work tomorrow.

06:47.630 --> 06:50.300
- I'm calling in sick.
- Whoa, whoa, no, no.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.790
I had to pull some strings with
Stan Borson at City Services

06:52.800 --> 06:55.940
to get you in there, and now I
got to go look at his boat.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.199
- But Dad!
- You slobber into your pillow

06:58.200 --> 07:01.680
for another 12 hours, and at
6:00 a.m., it's trash time.

07:03.970 --> 07:06.660
I'll put you down as a
maybe for the Dodger game.

07:08.510 --> 07:11.920
I'm stoked about you fellas
camping out here tonight,

07:11.930 --> 07:13.680
communing with nature.

07:13.860 --> 07:16.760
Do you think the coyotes
will kill us in our sleep?

07:16.880 --> 07:19.160
You'll be out here under
the protection of Hutash,

07:19.170 --> 07:21.560
the Great Spirit Mother
of the Chumash Indians.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.839
Let us never forget that we
stole this land from them.

07:23.840 --> 07:24.969
How can we forget?

07:24.970 --> 07:27.660
You ruin every Thanksgiving
with that bummer story.

07:27.670 --> 07:29.300
There he is!

07:30.420 --> 07:32.040
- Did you send it?
- Wait, what's going on?

07:32.050 --> 07:34.120
I mailed a letter to
Wendi pleading my case

07:34.130 --> 07:36.000
as to why she should be my girlfriend.

07:36.060 --> 07:37.420
Joey'll tell you.

07:37.430 --> 07:38.700
Joey put you up to this?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.750
- Oh, no.
- You're kidding?

07:40.760 --> 07:42.680
I'm like two and I know that was dumb.

07:42.780 --> 07:44.210
Oh...

07:44.220 --> 07:46.420
Oh, I should've known you
were being too nice.

07:46.430 --> 07:47.939
Stupid, stupid, Frank!

07:47.940 --> 07:50.980
My one regret is I didn't make
a copy of that primo letter,

07:50.990 --> 07:52.750
but I have whole chunks
committed to memory.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.120
I'll be doing a reading at 7:00 p.m.

07:54.130 --> 07:55.870
in the tree house tonight,
with light snacks.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.760
Oh. I can fix this.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.140
I'll get the letter back!

07:59.160 --> 08:00.440
Whatever Frank's plan was,

08:00.470 --> 08:02.370
he was likely to only make things worse,

08:02.380 --> 08:04.899
and as brothers we had
a duty to witness it.

08:07.930 --> 08:10.340
Dang it!

08:10.400 --> 08:11.700
My bicep is too big...

08:11.720 --> 08:13.840
I should not have done those
pushups this morning.

08:13.930 --> 08:15.750
Hey, your arms are skinny. You try.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.920
Okay.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.330
It's like they don't want
you to reach the mail.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.720
Hey! What are you hoodlums doing?

08:23.220 --> 08:25.290
- Nothing.
- Get out of there.

08:25.300 --> 08:26.420
Sorry, sir.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.920
Tampering with a mailbox
is a federal crime.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.799
The thing is, Mr. Mailman,

08:34.799 --> 08:36.500
I-I need that letter right there.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.289
- This one?
- It's a love letter

08:38.299 --> 08:40.600
I wrote to my brother's girlfriend.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.370
Nice try, but you're out of luck.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.840
Once something goes down that slot,

08:43.860 --> 08:44.959
it belongs to Uncle Sam

08:44.960 --> 08:46.520
till it reaches its destination.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.080
After that you can wipe
your butts with it.

08:49.090 --> 08:50.710
- Some do.
- Please!

08:50.720 --> 08:52.460
- Can you make an exception?
- No.

08:52.590 --> 08:54.620
And if I catch you
urchins tampering again,

08:54.630 --> 08:56.280
I'll have you sent to juvenile hall.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.860
What am I gonna do now?

09:01.880 --> 09:03.460
Confess to Eddie. Take your beating.

09:03.470 --> 09:04.660
He needs something to cheer him up.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.580
I'll look like such an
idiot in front of Wendi,

09:06.590 --> 09:07.750
in front of everybody.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.400
That letter should get
there today or tomorrow.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.580
You could be a big
weirdo and hang around

09:12.590 --> 09:14.300
Wendi's mailbox until it arrives.

09:14.380 --> 09:18.180
Yeah... yeah, that weirdo
thing is perfect for me.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.600
Thanks!

09:22.430 --> 09:23.460
Where'd Pat go?

09:23.470 --> 09:24.820
I'm in here!

09:24.880 --> 09:27.040
Why are you in the mailbox?

09:27.170 --> 09:29.420
I climbed in the door
when nobody was looking.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.790
Then the mailman locked
me in. And then...

09:31.800 --> 09:33.140
nope, that's everything!

09:33.180 --> 09:35.620
Look, next pickup isn't
till 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.

09:35.630 --> 09:37.920
And if Mom finds out, she's
totally gonna blame me.

09:37.930 --> 09:40.000
I knew Mom should've left me in charge.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.700
With Eddie's broken heart,
Frank's impending humiliation,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.500
and Pat currently property
of the U.S. Postal Service,

09:48.510 --> 09:50.160
you would've thought the
dinner conversation

09:50.170 --> 09:51.460
would've been more interesting.

09:51.470 --> 09:52.620
I can't eat.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.280
You should get dumped more often.

09:55.380 --> 09:56.780
Real nice, Joey.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.360
You're judging me for making
a move on Eddie's meatball?

09:59.380 --> 10:01.460
Maybe you should put that in a letter.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.370
It's not a bad habit for
you kids to get into...

10:03.380 --> 10:05.000
writing letters to each other.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.540
My sister Florence and I
still write twice a week,

10:07.550 --> 10:09.290
whether we have anything to say or not.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.460
I've got pie for dessert.
Serve yourselves.

10:12.470 --> 10:14.100
I'm going out tonight with Wendi.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.239
Eddie's Wendi?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.040
Well, she's not Eddie's Wendi anymore.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.000
She never truly was. You can't
possess another human being.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.620
- Also she dumped him.
- So now she's just Wendi.

10:22.630 --> 10:24.900
Well, if you really think about
it, she's not even that.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.500
Names are just labels, man.

10:26.510 --> 10:29.080
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Wendi's my friend too.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.470
We've been trying to get together.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.080
She suddenly has more free time.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.859
I'll be in my room.

10:33.860 --> 10:36.420
Set your alarm for 6:00 a.m.

10:36.430 --> 10:38.640
Garbage is your girlfriend now.

10:39.170 --> 10:41.640
- Where's Pat?
- Outside in the tent.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.660
Outside.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.870
Yeah, he was just so
excited to go camping

10:45.880 --> 10:47.330
that he couldn't wait till after dinner.

10:47.340 --> 10:48.620
It was very cute.

10:48.630 --> 10:50.120
It's such a fun age.

10:50.140 --> 10:53.420
- I should see if he's okay.
- Or you can use this,

10:53.430 --> 10:55.640
'cause he's pretending
he's an Arctic explorer.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.420
Ugh. Children's imaginations.

10:57.430 --> 10:59.580
Another time it would've
been called mental illness.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.040
Hello, Arctic Explorer Pat.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.380
Hey, Mommy!

11:05.400 --> 11:06.660
Everything all right out there?

11:06.680 --> 11:09.340
I'm fine. I love it in the tent.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.540
Thank you!

11:14.560 --> 11:16.260
Do you want any dinner?

11:16.280 --> 11:18.710
I made spaghetti with that sauce
that looks like tomato sauce.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.719
I'm good. I have camping snacks and gum.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.940
All right, I'll check on you later.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.580
You don't have to check on him.

11:24.590 --> 11:26.290
William and I will be
out there all night.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.460
I'm not really going to...
it's just something you say.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.500
Have you seen Dad's binoculars?

11:32.510 --> 11:33.710
If you're looking for your scruples,

11:33.720 --> 11:35.290
might I suggest a microscope?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.560
I need the binoculars. I'm
staking out Wendi's house

11:37.600 --> 11:40.000
- so I can get the letter back.
- Oh, and that way Eddie and Wendi

11:40.010 --> 11:42.000
- will never know you wrote it.
- That's the plan.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.710
- But you'll know.
- I have to know...

11:43.720 --> 11:45.040
I'm the guy making the plan.

11:45.050 --> 11:46.879
You tried to snake your
brother's girlfriend, man.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.120
I know. I know. And it was stupid.

11:49.130 --> 11:51.920
- I feel terrible now.
- That's your conscience.

11:51.930 --> 11:53.580
It's a caring friend who tells you

11:53.600 --> 11:54.680
when you've done something wrong.

11:54.700 --> 11:56.960
Wow, are you sure you don't
want to be a priest?

11:57.090 --> 11:59.440
Nah. Chicks.

12:02.130 --> 12:03.820
Pat, we're back!

12:03.840 --> 12:05.140
And we brought supplies.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.120
All right! Flashlight.

12:07.130 --> 12:08.580
Ow!

12:08.800 --> 12:09.940
Water.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.140
Ow!

12:11.470 --> 12:12.980
Teddy bear.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.000
- Ow!
- The teddy bear didn't hurt.

12:15.010 --> 12:17.580
I hit myself with the flashlight.

12:17.590 --> 12:19.060
Is there anything else you need?

12:19.120 --> 12:21.420
I'm okay... I love my
new life in the box.

12:21.430 --> 12:23.710
Except I really have to pee.

12:23.720 --> 12:25.790
- Oh, no.
- Oh. Uh...

12:25.800 --> 12:27.370
D-Don't... Just wait.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.370
We're gonna bring you
a jar or something.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.760
Oh, never mind. I figured it out.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.140
No...

12:34.340 --> 12:36.250
Pat, you can't do that!

12:36.260 --> 12:39.220
I'm just emptying the bota
bag so I can go in it.

12:41.160 --> 12:42.699
"The time we spent together

12:42.700 --> 12:44.589
were the happiest days of my life."

12:44.590 --> 12:47.300
Enough with the feelings...
talk about your bod.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.870
- What are you doing?
- Joey had this idea

12:49.880 --> 12:52.180
I could get Wendi back if I
wrote a good enough letter.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.420
Maybe you could help...

12:53.430 --> 12:55.250
you've got a knack for
romantic correspondence.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.500
Yeah, and didn't you win
some penmanship prize?

12:57.510 --> 13:00.840
Just a certificate. And
a coupon for Arby's.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.830
I'll be outside checking
on Pat and those guys.

13:03.840 --> 13:07.520
This is stupid, I'm
no good with writing.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.870
Hi, Mom. How was Wendi?

13:09.880 --> 13:11.960
Did you smell her? She
usually smells really good.

13:11.970 --> 13:13.660
Everything outside of this
house smells good to me.

13:13.740 --> 13:15.519
- Did you two have fun?
- No, actually.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.699
If you must know, I ended
my friendship with Wendi.

13:17.700 --> 13:18.780
For you.

13:19.130 --> 13:21.660
- You broke up with her?
- Wendi's having a big day.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.260
Well, I'm not happy about it.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.500
I don't know if you know this,

13:24.520 --> 13:26.160
but I don't have a lot
of female friends.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.960
Or male friends.

13:27.970 --> 13:30.580
Or even animals I get along with.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.370
But you have to make certain
sacrifices for your children.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.290
- Thank you, Mom.
- You'll understand one day

13:36.300 --> 13:37.790
when you have kids of
your own with someone

13:37.800 --> 13:38.920
not quite as good as Wendi.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.940
Does Pat have Dad's binoculars?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.420
I know he sometimes uses them

13:47.430 --> 13:49.120
for that fake talk show
he does with ants.

13:49.130 --> 13:50.540
I don't think so.

13:50.550 --> 13:53.240
- Well, I'll just ask him myself.
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.080
Hey, Pat, do you have Dad's binoculars?

13:57.100 --> 13:59.870
I wish. I can't see
anything in this mailbox.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.540
Whoa, y... What's going on?

14:03.550 --> 14:05.960
That is exactly the
question on the table.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.710
Where is Pat? And why does
he claim to be in a mailbox?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.750
That's just something he says...
when he's in a mailbox.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.960
Wait, he's been stuck in
there since this afternoon?

14:14.970 --> 14:17.420
That's crazy! He must be panicking.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.639
I'm okay!

14:18.640 --> 14:20.129
You guys were just
gonna leave him there?

14:20.130 --> 14:21.960
He's a little kid and it's after dark.

14:21.970 --> 14:23.440
It's after dark?!

14:23.460 --> 14:25.920
I didn't know that because
it's dark in here.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.540
Then what difference does it make?

14:27.550 --> 14:29.160
Because now I know!

14:29.200 --> 14:31.370
The monsters feed at night.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.330
Oh, I got to get him out of there.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.920
What do we do? What do we do?

14:35.930 --> 14:38.140
I guess we'll have to get him out.

14:55.930 --> 14:57.220
Good morning, Dad.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.760
- Want a cup of Joe?
- Smells good.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.900
I've been fiddling with my recipe.

15:01.940 --> 15:04.660
That kick you taste is cinnamon.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.040
Seen Eddie?

15:09.590 --> 15:11.160
Like angels.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.800
So precious when they're sleeping.

15:12.820 --> 15:14.400
Sweet.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.240
Mopey, let's go. Up and at 'em.

15:17.510 --> 15:20.160
I don't want to, Dad. I'm too unhappy.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.680
Welcome to being an adult...

15:21.760 --> 15:24.210
If you can wait five minutes,
my biscuits will be ready.

15:24.220 --> 15:26.840
He can't. Keep moving.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.200
It's the best thing for him.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.420
When stuff like this happens,
there's nothing like work

15:30.430 --> 15:31.920
to keep your mind off your troubles.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.120
He might need to talk about his troubles

15:34.140 --> 15:35.960
before he can get his mind off them.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.620
I already gave him the
top-of-the-line advice...

15:37.630 --> 15:39.500
"get back on the horse,"
"fish in the sea."

15:39.510 --> 15:43.330
Well, maybe it's not advice he needs.

15:43.340 --> 15:46.520
Eddie might need to feel
like someone is listening.

15:46.630 --> 15:48.210
You can't fix his sadness,

15:48.220 --> 15:50.830
but you can make him feel less alone.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.180
- You're only 10?
- Yep.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.250
Well, you're my favorite right now.

15:55.260 --> 15:56.640
Thanks.

15:56.660 --> 15:58.100
Need a warm up?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.400
Top me off.

16:17.930 --> 16:20.020
Dad? Why are you here?

16:20.060 --> 16:21.480
Did you bring me a biscuit?

16:21.510 --> 16:24.080
I did, but, uh, I ate it in the car.

16:24.090 --> 16:25.950
I've been thinking about that sweet loot

16:25.960 --> 16:27.040
you've been bringing home.

16:27.340 --> 16:28.760
I thought I'd get in on that.

16:31.630 --> 16:34.920
Let's go. It's not gonna
smell any better in an hour.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.040
My dad finally figured out
how to be there for Eddie.

16:42.050 --> 16:43.660
It worked out for both of them.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.370
Eddie got to pour his heart out, and...

16:45.380 --> 16:46.580
because of the noise of the truck...

16:46.600 --> 16:48.460
Dad didn't have to hear a word of it.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.980
Also he found some sunglasses.

16:58.880 --> 17:02.040
Oh! Wendi. So weird
running into you here.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.619
Yeah, it is weird for
you to be on my porch.

17:04.630 --> 17:06.079
With my family's mail.

17:06.089 --> 17:08.220
I-I was just passing by,

17:08.280 --> 17:11.460
saw the mailman, thought I'd
save you a trip to the box.

17:11.630 --> 17:15.000
You thought you'd save
me a trip to do this?

17:15.010 --> 17:16.579
Did Eddie ask you to spy on me?

17:16.589 --> 17:18.000
Honestly, he didn't.

17:18.010 --> 17:19.979
Well, there's no other
sensible explanation

17:19.980 --> 17:21.920
unless you've suddenly
fallen in love with me.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.300
But seriously.

17:26.339 --> 17:27.900
I am kind of here because of Eddie...

17:27.930 --> 17:29.580
not that he asked me, but...

17:29.590 --> 17:31.020
I'm worried about the guy.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.120
- He's heartbroken.
- I am too.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.420
That wasn't an easy decision.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.900
But how can I have a future with
a man with no drive to succeed?

17:39.050 --> 17:41.620
I'm sorry, have we gone
back in a time machine?

17:41.630 --> 17:45.519
I thought this was 1972, not 1970.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.240
- What?
- Wh...

17:47.260 --> 17:49.660
Men and women aren't bound
by the same strictures

17:49.670 --> 17:52.290
they were even a couple years ago.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.140
"You've come a long way,
baby." Sound familiar?

17:55.220 --> 17:58.100
Getting this magazine says
you are a modern woman,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.900
yet you've got some pretty
old-timey ideas about men.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.379
I just want him to be
the best he can be.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.509
Well, he's there.

18:03.510 --> 18:04.660
He's already the best.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.000
He cares about other people,

18:06.020 --> 18:08.080
and he's always ready to help.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.960
That's true.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.750
Eddie may not be a fancy

18:12.760 --> 18:14.550
merit-badge-winning honor student

18:14.580 --> 18:17.210
with penmanship that wins
delicious sandwiches,

18:17.220 --> 18:20.420
but...

18:20.460 --> 18:23.500
those guys can be selfish jerks.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.740
Whereas Eddie will
always have your back.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.460
You've given me something
to think about, Frank.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.290
Thank you.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.160
Eddie is lucky to have you as a brother.

18:35.130 --> 18:37.290
Better that than a romantic rival

18:37.300 --> 18:39.460
which would not end well for
him with my vertical leap

18:39.470 --> 18:40.870
and future earning power.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.160
Have a great day.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.600
- Hi, Eddie.
- Wendi?

18:57.680 --> 18:58.760
What are you doing?

18:59.300 --> 19:01.820
I collected these from my route.

19:01.900 --> 19:05.160
I don't think people throw away
light bulbs that are still...

19:05.170 --> 19:06.480
We have a winner!

19:06.560 --> 19:10.439
See? I knew this was a good idea.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.370
I came here to make up with you,

19:13.380 --> 19:14.680
but now I'm reconsidering.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.720
I want to make up with you too.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.250
I would go bananas for that to happen.

19:19.260 --> 19:22.940
But... I am worried I'm never
gonna be what you want.

19:23.050 --> 19:25.640
I mean, Berkeley is
really a reach for me.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.740
I tried writing you a letter
last night and it was garbage.

19:28.770 --> 19:30.620
And I know garbage...
I'm a professional.

19:31.130 --> 19:35.720
Let's just both try our
best and see what happens.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.710
And if Berkeley doesn't work out,

19:37.720 --> 19:40.330
you've got other things going for you.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.750
That's the thing that stuck with me

19:41.760 --> 19:43.290
after my conversation with Frank.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.780
What conversation with Frank?

19:44.840 --> 19:46.370
He came to my house this morning.

19:46.380 --> 19:47.790
Frank was at your house?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.100
That guy.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.750
Frank? Frank?

19:51.760 --> 19:53.540
- Frank?
- Is everything okay?

19:53.550 --> 19:54.940
You were at Wendi's house?

19:55.220 --> 19:58.420
Um, gosh, uh... yeah.

19:58.430 --> 19:59.879
But I never found the binoculars,

19:59.880 --> 20:01.740
so I-I couldn't see much.

20:02.380 --> 20:05.580
- Thank you!
- Okay. You're welcome.

20:05.590 --> 20:08.220
I was just telling Eddie how you
helped bring us back together.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.920
- As was my intention.
- Such a great brother.

20:10.930 --> 20:13.540
Wendi, get in here.

20:13.620 --> 20:16.560
Looks like you two have
settled your little dust-up.

20:16.580 --> 20:19.120
I'm not sure what
Frank's doing in there.

20:19.130 --> 20:21.540
I'm not surprised though,
he's always somewhere.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.680
Everything is copacetic.

20:23.980 --> 20:28.660
Maybe now's a good time to have
another driving lesson, huh?

20:29.010 --> 20:30.640
I kinda want to hang out with Wendi.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.120
You already know how to
drive. Don't be selfish.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.760
I just saw that "French
Connection" movie...

20:35.780 --> 20:37.420
I want to try that.

20:41.660 --> 20:43.680
I'm glad you and Eddie
patched things up.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.660
As a mother, you can
never really be happy

20:45.680 --> 20:47.440
when one of your children is unhappy.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.580
'Cause they will not be quiet about it.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.420
Well, I'm sorry for what
we put you through.

20:51.460 --> 20:55.060
I've been waiting for
that apology, thank you.

20:56.010 --> 20:58.470
I'm glad that we can keep
up with these lessons.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.879
- Mm.
- You're doing so well.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.420
I got to say, I really
like the feeling of power.

21:02.430 --> 21:05.370
As a female driver, you gain a
feeling of freedom and autonomy.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.150
I could just push my foot all
the way down to the floor

21:07.160 --> 21:08.980
and drive right into
that wall over there.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.870
Good luck raising the kids, Mike.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.660
Uh, I think maybe that's
enough for today, Mrs. Cleary.

21:13.670 --> 21:15.620
Mike would not last two hours...
