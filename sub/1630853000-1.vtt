01:10.622 --> 01:11.789
Hey, shut the fuck up.

01:41.218 --> 01:42.687
<i>Dispatch, heading
to Brownsville Road school.</i>

01:45.823 --> 01:47.290
<i>Check on the west side
of the school.</i>

01:49.794 --> 01:51.663
<i>No activity.
is all clear.</i>

02:06.844 --> 02:08.544
Excuse me. Excuse me.

02:26.964 --> 02:28.800
Chief, patching the mayor in.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.803
Put it through.

02:32.603 --> 02:34.504
- This is Alston.
- <i>Alston?</i>

02:34.538 --> 02:36.574
<i>This is Mayor Wimbly.</i>

02:36.607 --> 02:38.843
<i>You saved a lot of those kids,
but we need everybody else out</i>

02:39.309 --> 02:41.579
or you're out, understood?

02:42.080 --> 02:44.247
<i>We can't afford any more
casualties. End this.</i>

02:44.582 --> 02:45.650
It's not over.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.721
How long has it been?

02:49.754 --> 02:51.521
It's been
16 fucking hours.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.625
Shannon,
I think the government's

02:54.659 --> 02:56.326
been taking advantage of me.

02:57.662 --> 02:59.463
Let's plan our exit strategy.

03:01.065 --> 03:02.332
Hey, shut the fuck up.

03:03.067 --> 03:04.534
Everybody listen up!

03:04.736 --> 03:07.337
Everyone line up in the middle
of the gym, on your knees.

03:09.506 --> 03:10.608
Quiet down!

03:30.962 --> 03:31.896
You're looking for
a comment?

03:32.395 --> 03:33.731
On or off the record?

03:33.765 --> 03:34.999
What'd the mayor say?

03:35.032 --> 03:36.868
Word from the mayor
is my team stands down.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.269
He'll talk as long as it takes.

03:39.704 --> 03:40.738
But we don't have that long.

03:41.739 --> 03:43.440
Yeah, I agree.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.009
And once they realize those
kids were the only leverage,

03:45.042 --> 03:46.644
this shit's going to go south.

03:47.011 --> 03:49.446
So what would you do.
If you were me?

03:50.413 --> 03:54.919
I'm you, I give us the nod,
Let my team clean it up.

03:54.952 --> 03:57.622
We'll fix it. Go back inside,
business as usual.

04:17.406 --> 04:19.744
Mason online over. Go for Miller

04:19.777 --> 04:21.712
Miller.
Studied the plans.

04:21.745 --> 04:25.382
The roof is composed
of steel panels, durable,

04:25.415 --> 04:27.585
will open for us, will not
fall in on the hostages.

04:30.788 --> 04:32.857
<i>And the east wall
is the place for the blast.</i>

04:33.157 --> 04:35.793
Locals won't see it,
they'll be trying to get in

04:35.827 --> 04:37.962
from the front while
we extract from the side.

04:39.130 --> 04:40.497
Mason for Rogers.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.900
In position, guys.
'Bout to light it up.

04:48.139 --> 04:49.472
Mason for Connolly.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.943
En route,
less than one mike out.

04:51.976 --> 04:53.911
- Confirm when landed.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

04:54.712 --> 04:55.880
This doesn't feel right.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.050
- You gotta do something.
- Hey, we got orders.

04:59.684 --> 05:02.553
You wanted to be here.
I fought to have you here.

05:03.486 --> 05:04.121
It's what we do.

05:44.494 --> 05:45.897
<i>Dispatch,
headin' to the extraction zone</i>

05:57.074 --> 05:58.643
<i>Eyes on
the police chopper flying</i>

05:58.676 --> 05:59.810
<i>into the extraction zone.</i>

05:59.844 --> 06:01.879
- Delta in position.
- Stand by.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.782
We are ghosts if this
mission is compromised.

06:05.182 --> 06:06.951
<i>Prepare to extract on orders.</i>

06:09.954 --> 06:11.521
Locked and loaded.

06:11.555 --> 06:13.591
<i>Chopper is
in blast radius, stand by,</i>

06:13.624 --> 06:14.825
<i>wait for my command.</i>

06:14.859 --> 06:16.459
<i>Captain, we're exposed.</i>

06:16.493 --> 06:17.527
<i>We can't afford to wait.</i>

06:17.561 --> 06:18.596
<i>Standing by.</i>

06:19.496 --> 06:22.033
Hold. Not clear to engage.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.745
We must ensure
the existence of our people.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.882
And the future
of white children.

06:37.915 --> 06:39.951
No!

06:43.988 --> 06:45.156
<i>Dispatch, headin' back</i>

06:45.189 --> 06:46.757
<i>to rendezvous point,
all clear here.</i>

06:47.925 --> 06:50.594
Clear to engage.
Clear to engage.

07:08.545 --> 07:11.048
Fuck! I told you
we couldn't trust the cops.

07:11.082 --> 07:13.050
All you mother fuckers
are dead now.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.628
Engage, engage, engage!
Go, go, go!

07:33.804 --> 07:35.873
Aim for camo, watch out
for civilians.

07:35.906 --> 07:37.041
Can't see shit.

07:38.776 --> 07:39.810
Get the fuck outta here.

07:43.948 --> 07:45.649
- Fuck!
- What the fuck?

07:55.726 --> 07:57.028
Enough of this fucking bullshit.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.896
Get down, get down,
get down!

08:01.832 --> 08:03.000
Get up!

08:06.170 --> 08:07.905
Get down, get down!

08:07.938 --> 08:09.273
The roof's gonna fall!

08:09.306 --> 08:10.608
Stay the course.

08:16.347 --> 08:17.581
What are you doing?

08:21.385 --> 08:22.953
<i>What was that?
Sounded like an explosion.</i>

08:22.987 --> 08:24.188
<i>Circling back to assist.</i>

08:25.956 --> 08:27.925
Get down, get down, get down!

08:37.400 --> 08:38.235
Bring it on!

08:42.073 --> 08:44.708
Back up, back up.
I will shoot them!

08:44.742 --> 08:46.243
I will still these hostages!

08:46.277 --> 08:47.745
Put them up,
motherfucker, you put them up.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.082
- Let her go.
- Fuck you!

08:55.086 --> 08:56.787
Put 'em up!

08:57.088 --> 08:58.189
Let her go.

08:58.689 --> 09:00.191
Hey, get them outta here!

09:00.224 --> 09:02.126
- Everybody out!
- Get the fuck out of here.

09:02.159 --> 09:03.360
Move! Get out of the gym!

09:03.394 --> 09:04.628
Put your hands up!

09:05.564 --> 09:09.033
Turn around and walk
backwards towards me, fucker.

09:11.669 --> 09:15.139
I'll come towards ya.
But she's coming with me.

09:16.841 --> 09:17.875
You're all coming with me.

09:27.084 --> 09:28.385
No!

09:28.419 --> 09:29.787
No!

09:39.230 --> 09:41.732
<i>I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

09:42.233 --> 09:44.068
<i>Chopper's going down!
Chopper's going down!</i>

09:58.482 --> 10:00.184
Conner! Conner!

10:10.361 --> 10:11.829
Conner! Conner!

10:56.840 --> 10:59.009
- Yo, let's go bro.
- I ain't late yet.

11:00.110 --> 11:02.313
- Yo, what's up man?
- Come on.

11:37.047 --> 11:38.182
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.021
Goddamn! Get the hell
off my car, man!

11:44.556 --> 11:46.056
Dude!

11:46.625 --> 11:48.359
Jesus Christ!

12:00.337 --> 12:01.338
Fuck off me!

12:18.222 --> 12:19.490
You don't want to do that, bro.

12:19.523 --> 12:21.091
Fuck outta here, white boy,

12:21.125 --> 12:22.126
mind your own God damn business.

12:30.602 --> 12:31.435
No.

12:46.884 --> 12:47.518
You okay?

12:49.086 --> 12:50.254
Yeah.

12:50.988 --> 12:53.157
I'm okay. Shit.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.261
- He dead?
- Yeah, he's dead.

12:58.663 --> 13:00.397
So you okay? You all right, kid?

13:00.431 --> 13:03.000
You know what he did, right?
Fuck.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.201
Yeah, long time ago.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.373
- All right, kid, get out, go.
- I can't leave you here.

13:09.808 --> 13:12.509
Joaquin, get the fuck
out of here, now, go, go.

13:14.912 --> 13:15.613
I got this, go!

13:17.514 --> 13:19.550
Ain't no white man never
did me no good like you, man.

13:19.584 --> 13:21.018
Get the fuck out of here!

13:38.135 --> 13:40.204
Go ahead, do it.
Do it.

13:41.606 --> 13:43.340
- Do it.
- You'll be the first to die.

13:43.374 --> 13:45.042
All right, let's do it then.

14:07.732 --> 14:09.466
I don't think
you wanna do that Connolly.

14:16.206 --> 14:18.643
Okay. All right,
all right, you got me,

14:18.676 --> 14:20.477
you got me.
All right, all right.

14:35.159 --> 14:37.928
Damn. This brother
had value to me.

14:41.699 --> 14:43.100
Blood begets blood.

14:43.768 --> 14:47.004
Tyrone Pettis. You really want
a government body on you?

14:47.237 --> 14:48.272
I got six already.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.240
Smoke this motherfucker.

14:50.274 --> 14:51.241
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.011
Nah, wait.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.982
Grab Cornell's gun.
We're not gonna kill you.

15:01.452 --> 15:04.087
We're gonna let you explain why
you killed an unarmed Black man.

15:04.789 --> 15:07.224
You really gonna let
this motherfucker pass?

15:07.257 --> 15:09.627
These... are my streets.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.697
I know everything that goes
on in these streets.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.365
Nah. It's not a pass.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.101
I got plans for Conner.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.207
You got lucky today.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.481
- Bullshit.
- I'm telling you like it is.

15:30.815 --> 15:33.050
just because we haven't
made anything stick,

15:33.083 --> 15:35.219
doesn't mean we don't know
how ruthless Tyrone Pettis is.

15:35.753 --> 15:38.021
You take out one of his men.
He takes out you.

15:39.791 --> 15:42.359
Maybe we should get
Chief Alston in here, huh?

15:42.392 --> 15:44.027
Why the fuck would I do that?

15:44.061 --> 15:45.529
Because you guys don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.766
That kid's out there
right now and he needs help.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.268
He's in danger.
He could back up my story.

15:51.301 --> 15:52.670
- Go find the kid.
- Look, Conner.

15:53.638 --> 15:57.207
says you've
been under stress, late nights,

15:57.474 --> 15:59.309
always taking personal touch
with your parolees.

16:00.712 --> 16:04.214
The best we got.
But even the best slip up.

16:04.649 --> 16:05.750
Find Joaquin.

16:07.251 --> 16:10.187
Right. Joaquin Smith, right?

16:10.487 --> 16:11.321
Yeah.

16:13.190 --> 16:14.024
Found him.

16:18.796 --> 16:19.631
No.

16:20.798 --> 16:22.800
- Damn it!
- What happened, Conner?

16:23.400 --> 16:25.670
Because your parolee
pissed you off.

16:26.336 --> 16:27.705
When you confronted him
and got jumpy.

16:29.239 --> 16:30.675
I tried to save this kid.

16:31.308 --> 16:33.243
If that's the truth
then you're really fucked.

16:34.211 --> 16:35.045
Suspended.

16:36.313 --> 16:37.715
Badge and your piece.

16:48.325 --> 16:49.694
Fuck both of you.

17:09.814 --> 17:12.549
Hey, hey, look who's here,
Uncle Pettis.

17:12.983 --> 17:15.385
- How you doing today?
- Good.

17:15.419 --> 17:17.755
What you looking at?
I see you looking at that money.

17:17.789 --> 17:19.522
- How's those grades?
- Good.

17:19.557 --> 17:21.191
- Real good?
- Yeah, yeah!

17:21.223 --> 17:22.526
- All A's.
- Yeah, you first. All A's?

17:22.560 --> 17:23.895
What about you?

17:23.928 --> 17:26.262
- I got like one B and...
- One B and all A's?

17:26.296 --> 17:27.431
- Yeah.
- And you?

17:27.464 --> 17:29.166
- All A's.
- All A's?

17:29.199 --> 17:31.401
I'll... I'll show you my...
I'll show you my grades.

17:31.435 --> 17:33.403
Here you go.

17:33.437 --> 17:36.608
All A's. All A's and one B,
I like that.

17:36.641 --> 17:38.175
You're gonna change that B
to a A, right?

17:38.208 --> 17:39.543
- Yeah.
- And you?

17:39.577 --> 17:40.578
And you?

17:40.612 --> 17:42.446
Wait, wait, wait.
Who's talking?

17:42.880 --> 17:44.214
- I'm talking.
- Oh.

17:44.247 --> 17:45.349
Thank you.

17:45.984 --> 17:47.719
And what are your grades?

17:48.218 --> 17:50.287
I'm gonna let you have
this and next time I see you,

17:50.320 --> 17:51.221
you're gonna have
all A's, right?

17:51.455 --> 17:54.124
Just keep doing your best.
That's what I care about.

17:54.391 --> 17:56.493
What you doing, young man?
How you doing?

17:56.526 --> 17:58.362
- All right, yeah.
- Tell me about them grades.

17:58.395 --> 18:00.632
- Oh, yes sir, all A's.
- All A's? Here you go.

18:00.665 --> 18:02.900
- Thank you so much.
- Man, thank you, sir.

18:02.934 --> 18:05.570
There you go, no, I'm not
short-changing you, all A's.

18:05.603 --> 18:07.572
I'm hoping that you're
gonna do so well and go to

18:07.605 --> 18:09.807
college that y'all can
loan me some money one day.

18:09.841 --> 18:10.908
Yes sir, we'll be looking out
for you.

18:10.942 --> 18:12.242
All right.

18:16.413 --> 18:18.281
Lucifer's left his lair.

18:20.118 --> 18:21.586
See what he wants.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.560
Fuck you wanna do, white boy?

18:29.594 --> 18:30.628
To what do I owe the pleasure?

18:31.495 --> 18:32.897
Love what you've done here.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.300
Despite the rumors.

18:39.637 --> 18:40.638
Well, thank you.

18:41.639 --> 18:42.907
Speaking of rumors, um,

18:42.940 --> 18:44.374
have you heard what's happening
on the Southside?

18:45.977 --> 18:48.412
They passin' out fentanyl
like suckers.

18:51.281 --> 18:52.482
Any plans on addressing that?

18:53.151 --> 18:56.821
Knowing what battles
to fight and when to fight,

18:56.854 --> 18:58.823
that's critical.
That's why I'm here.

19:00.490 --> 19:02.492
You left a loose end.

19:04.361 --> 19:06.764
No. I don't leave loose ends.

19:06.798 --> 19:09.499
Apparently, you do.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.468
And you did.

19:12.136 --> 19:14.438
No loose ends. It's a strategy.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.474
Know what battles
to fight and when.

19:18.375 --> 19:21.846
- It's of critical importance.
- I like this.

19:22.146 --> 19:23.648
You like what?

19:23.681 --> 19:26.884
Two intelligent men,
discussing strategy in our city.

19:29.587 --> 19:30.520
Re-election this year.

19:31.889 --> 19:33.958
I'm expecting a large donation.

19:33.991 --> 19:34.826
As always.

19:54.411 --> 19:55.880
This
motherfucker want?

19:57.347 --> 19:58.281
Ride with me.

20:02.486 --> 20:03.554
That one right there.

20:08.092 --> 20:09.660
No gun, no witnesses.

20:10.795 --> 20:13.363
Nope, something doesn't
feel right.

20:13.396 --> 20:14.632
He asked for you.

20:16.366 --> 20:17.602
- Two black coffees.
- Thank you.

20:19.503 --> 20:20.537
Thank you, darling.

20:21.606 --> 20:23.440
He shot a Black kid.

20:25.643 --> 20:26.644
I don't know how to help.

20:38.756 --> 20:40.057
I need you to work out
that debt you owe me.

20:41.626 --> 20:43.828
Your little stunt cost
me my job today.

20:44.128 --> 20:45.362
Consider us even.

20:45.730 --> 20:47.765
I get no tangible benefits
from you being fired.

20:48.666 --> 20:49.967
You need to replace my asset.

20:50.367 --> 20:52.069
The supply side
of supply and demand.

20:52.904 --> 20:53.905
Go fuck yourself.

20:55.606 --> 20:56.774
Nah, Big O.

20:58.542 --> 20:59.577
Not here.

21:04.481 --> 21:05.783
<i>I think we should go
talk to Pettis.</i>

21:05.817 --> 21:06.918
And say what?

21:07.484 --> 21:09.086
That if anything
happened to Connolly,

21:09.386 --> 21:10.655
we're gonna bury him.

21:11.856 --> 21:13.356
Well, it's a little overkill.

21:14.992 --> 21:17.061
Why is that every time
it comes to going after Pettis,

21:18.162 --> 21:18.996
you seem scared?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.103
I've never been scared
and Pettis isn't stupid.

22:08.045 --> 22:10.413
Oh, shit.

22:20.691 --> 22:22.693
I'm home, baby.

22:22.727 --> 22:24.862
Sorry I'm late.
It was a long day at work.

22:27.798 --> 22:28.833
That's okay, baby.

22:32.003 --> 22:33.536
Did you get the raise?

22:36.908 --> 22:38.441
They're going to tell me.

22:42.613 --> 22:43.881
Need that money, Conner.

22:45.850 --> 22:47.550
I know, baby, I know.

22:48.019 --> 22:50.453
Can I come in?

22:52.023 --> 22:53.724
- Yep.
- You okay?

22:55.059 --> 22:56.594
Why are you on the floor?

23:03.567 --> 23:05.202
- Just give me a moment,
- Okay.

23:16.781 --> 23:18.448
- Hey, baby?
- Yeah, babe?

23:19.250 --> 23:21.118
Oh, we're gonna need that raise.

23:21.986 --> 23:23.721
Yeah, I know, baby, I know.

23:27.625 --> 23:28.592
I mean we.

23:29.860 --> 23:30.795
I know, babe.

23:31.929 --> 23:33.097
I mean we.

23:34.265 --> 23:35.900
You're pregnant?

23:35.933 --> 23:37.668
- Hey!
- Baby on board!

23:45.276 --> 23:46.110
Wow.

23:47.345 --> 23:50.948
- I thought you'd be happy.
- No, no, I'm happy. I am happy.

23:50.982 --> 23:53.284
- You're happy.
- Yes. My God.

23:55.953 --> 23:57.520
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

23:57.555 --> 23:58.889
Okay.

23:58.923 --> 23:59.991
I can't believe
we're having a baby.

24:00.591 --> 24:01.659
I love you.

24:01.892 --> 24:03.094
Love you, baby.

24:05.129 --> 24:06.764
You're going to be
the best mom ever.

24:06.797 --> 24:07.765
I can't believe

24:07.798 --> 24:09.266
there's a baby in here.

24:09.300 --> 24:12.803
- I know.
- Hello, baby. Hello.

24:12.837 --> 24:14.605
Hello?

24:14.638 --> 24:16.741
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
We can't park here.

24:16.774 --> 24:18.042
Seriously,
they're gonna kill us.

24:19.610 --> 24:20.978
Let's get you something
to eat, something healthy.

24:21.779 --> 24:22.947
I know great diner.

24:23.814 --> 24:25.116
Wait, healthy diner?

24:26.217 --> 24:28.185
Bacon and eggs, baby, protein.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.721
Okay, bacon and eggs.

24:37.061 --> 24:38.662
- Okay.
- Get up slowly, honey.

24:38.696 --> 24:40.965
Nice and easy.

24:40.998 --> 24:42.566
We don't want to take any falls.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.834
Yeah, it's fine.

24:46.037 --> 24:46.937
You hungry?

24:49.006 --> 24:51.642
Yeah, I'm thinking
an avocado, one every day.

24:52.176 --> 24:55.079
- It's good for brain health.
- Where'd you learn that?

24:55.780 --> 24:57.848
I read about it,
I've read a couple things.

24:57.882 --> 24:59.717
I heard some things.

25:36.654 --> 25:38.022
Gonna be okay, girl,
you gonna be okay,

25:38.055 --> 25:38.989
just breathe.

25:50.234 --> 25:53.971
- I'm deeply sorry about...
- If you don't get your gutter,

25:54.371 --> 25:58.275
fake Brooks Brothers ass
away from me and my family...

25:59.376 --> 26:01.245
Cornell died because of you!

26:01.612 --> 26:04.014
And I told him
to leave your ass alone.

26:06.183 --> 26:08.152
Now! Go!

26:26.804 --> 26:27.705
Look at it.

26:38.782 --> 26:39.817
You want me to leave with that?

26:44.355 --> 26:45.689
I didn't think so.

26:55.432 --> 26:56.934
She still mad.

26:58.903 --> 27:01.071
So I need you to eat
twice as much, baby,

27:01.105 --> 27:02.106
'cause you gotta
feed the baby now

27:02.139 --> 27:03.274
Okay, I ate plenty.

27:03.307 --> 27:04.975
But the thing is
you don't deal with

27:05.009 --> 27:06.877
some of the morning sickness
stuff that I deal with.

27:06.911 --> 27:10.414
- So no baby, no say.
- Seatbelt.

27:10.447 --> 27:12.349
you gotta wear a seatbelt.

27:12.383 --> 27:14.084
- Mm-hmm, okay.
- No question about it.

27:29.767 --> 27:30.834
Don't fight it, white boy.

27:31.869 --> 27:33.971
Conner!

27:34.004 --> 27:35.873
Don't fight it! Don't fight it!

27:37.975 --> 27:39.944
Conner! Conner!

27:41.011 --> 27:43.480
Conner!

27:46.450 --> 27:47.384
<i>Conner!</i>

27:54.925 --> 27:55.859
The fuck?

28:03.234 --> 28:04.068
Candace!

28:06.370 --> 28:08.172
Candace! Mother...

28:19.817 --> 28:22.219
What did you do to my wife?
Where is she?

28:26.924 --> 28:28.392
Call me on this when you got it.

28:28.425 --> 28:30.294
- When I get what?
- My money.

28:30.327 --> 28:31.395
What money?

28:32.564 --> 28:35.332
I tried to discuss it with
you like a gentleman earlier,

28:35.966 --> 28:38.035
but clearly you needed some
additional motivation

28:38.068 --> 28:39.003
to hear what I was saying.

28:39.870 --> 28:43.274
You terminated Cornell.
Cornell was just 25.

28:43.307 --> 28:45.009
He brought me about 250 a year.

28:45.509 --> 28:47.778
He had at least
20 more years of service.

28:47.978 --> 28:49.913
Subtract five years
he might have spent in prison,

28:49.947 --> 28:51.849
so you owe me, what?

28:53.984 --> 28:55.085
Six point two million.

28:56.186 --> 28:57.221
What?

28:57.589 --> 28:59.156
Lost earnings, Connelly.

29:00.124 --> 29:02.159
But to show you that
I'm a reasonable businessman,

29:03.260 --> 29:04.895
I'm going
to discount that amount

29:05.329 --> 29:07.965
for inflation and
other variable reasons,

29:07.998 --> 29:09.900
and we'll just say
you owe me, uh,

29:09.933 --> 29:10.568
even two million.

29:11.869 --> 29:13.504
I don't have 2,000.

29:13.971 --> 29:16.507
I know. City pays you shit.

29:21.211 --> 29:22.246
What's this?

29:23.881 --> 29:25.883
Southside address, what
am I supposed to do with this?

29:26.350 --> 29:29.153
A treasure map. Find a way
to save your wife, Connolly.

29:30.888 --> 29:32.289
How much time
you think you need?

29:34.024 --> 29:35.125
It's noon.

29:36.894 --> 29:37.595
I give you till midnight.

29:40.097 --> 29:41.198
That's impossible.

29:43.901 --> 29:47.204
Have faith, pull yourself up
by your bootstraps.

29:47.237 --> 29:48.472
Find a way
where there is no way.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.908
That shit sound familiar?

29:51.408 --> 29:52.843
The keys in the glove box.

30:08.292 --> 30:12.162
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

30:45.195 --> 30:46.296
Fuck!

30:56.240 --> 30:57.241
Watch it, asshole!

31:14.124 --> 31:15.359
<i>I love you so much.</i>

31:37.281 --> 31:38.382
All right, motherfuckers.

32:35.205 --> 32:36.340
Shit.

32:46.183 --> 32:49.086
Hey, brother. Long time no see.

32:49.787 --> 32:50.655
Maybe not long enough.

32:51.421 --> 32:53.257
I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

32:57.695 --> 33:00.230
- Move your foot.
- I need your help.

33:01.666 --> 33:02.533
I said move your foot.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.069
I can't do that.

33:08.472 --> 33:10.140
You didn't listen to me before.

33:11.508 --> 33:12.810
And you know how that ended.

33:16.581 --> 33:19.584
Do you remember when Dad died?
You were twelve.

33:19.984 --> 33:22.554
You found this gun when
Mom was packing up his stuff.

33:23.655 --> 33:25.222
Yeah. So?

33:25.690 --> 33:29.359
You aimed that gun at me.
And I told you,

33:30.260 --> 33:34.131
"You ever point of gun at me
again, I'll break your face."

33:37.602 --> 33:39.236
Yeah, but we're not 12 anymore.

33:46.644 --> 33:48.746
Get off of me.
Get off of me!

34:19.577 --> 34:20.712
Get the fuck off me.

34:32.255 --> 34:33.591
I couldn't carry you forever.

34:34.391 --> 34:36.594
Yeah. I was readjusting.

34:37.393 --> 34:40.297
- For how long, Tim?
- How long is it supposed to be

34:41.065 --> 34:42.634
till I'm okay with
shooting those people?

34:44.569 --> 34:47.471
I adjusted. You just do.

34:54.812 --> 34:57.381
- I'm not you.
- That's a good thing.

34:58.650 --> 34:59.483
What do you want, Conner?

35:01.786 --> 35:03.721
I need two million dollars
by midnight.

35:06.323 --> 35:09.526
Okay, why didn't you say?
Let me just go get my wallet.

35:10.293 --> 35:11.328
What the fuck man?

35:12.329 --> 35:15.365
Tyrone Pettis. He took Candace.

35:16.968 --> 35:18.435
I killed one of his guys.

35:18.468 --> 35:19.637
Don't you ever learn?

35:21.005 --> 35:22.940
Have you not shot
enough people in this life?

35:24.008 --> 35:26.778
If you walk away, she dies.

35:27.177 --> 35:28.746
She'll die anyway.

35:31.281 --> 35:33.550
Not just her.
You're gonna be an uncle.

35:55.006 --> 35:56.239
Yeah.

35:58.542 --> 35:59.577
Yeah.

36:02.312 --> 36:02.980
If I have to.

36:04.514 --> 36:07.652
Don't fucking wanna. Yeah.

36:09.453 --> 36:10.520
All right.

36:23.868 --> 36:25.235
We don't have
any other family, Timmy.

36:26.503 --> 36:27.370
I hope it's a girl.

36:30.675 --> 36:32.476
What the fuck'd you do that for?

36:32.509 --> 36:33.443
What'd I do that for?

36:34.011 --> 36:35.278
You know why.

36:36.446 --> 36:37.547
Tell me everything.

36:39.984 --> 36:41.719
<i>Hey,
all you noon-time rides.</i>

36:41.753 --> 36:44.421
<i>There are reports of a parole
officer shooting in town,</i>

36:44.454 --> 36:46.423
<i>Jackson Police Chief
just announced the seizure</i>

36:46.456 --> 36:48.425
<i>of all security camera footage
in the area.</i>

36:48.458 --> 36:50.728
<i>A bold move.
He's taking questions now.</i>

36:51.229 --> 36:52.930
There are rumors
that this seizure

36:52.964 --> 36:54.699
is being served
without a warrant.

36:54.732 --> 36:56.433
- Is that true?
- The warrant's on site.

36:56.466 --> 36:58.836
Chef Alston, are you
aware of the other rumors

36:58.870 --> 37:00.004
that you provide a haven

37:00.037 --> 37:01.239
for drug dealers in this city?

37:02.039 --> 37:03.540
Who said that?

37:03.574 --> 37:05.375
Are you aware they also say
that the only reason

37:05.408 --> 37:06.409
why you have this job

37:06.978 --> 37:09.680
is 'cause you milked
that hostage situation

37:09.714 --> 37:11.616
or you'd still
be on a desk, Chief?

37:13.818 --> 37:16.554
A lot of people
have died on my watch.

37:17.955 --> 37:21.291
I will always bear
that pain every day.

37:22.827 --> 37:25.897
And that pain drives me

37:27.732 --> 37:28.766
to protect this city.

37:31.468 --> 37:35.940
This city. It's all for you.
So you can print that.

37:36.406 --> 37:38.042
Chief, you have a comment
for the record?

37:38.075 --> 37:39.509
Chief,
are these allegations true?

37:39.543 --> 37:40.645
Chief, comment?

37:47.652 --> 37:49.987
That was beautiful.
I almost believed that bullshit.

37:50.021 --> 37:52.089
Get the fuck out of here,
you're cracking me up.

37:52.123 --> 37:53.958
Your stunts keep
getting bigger and bigger.

37:54.391 --> 37:57.028
You fly too close to the sun,
you're going to burn your wings

37:57.061 --> 37:58.563
and everybody
else's in the process.

37:58.596 --> 37:59.664
What do you care?

38:00.565 --> 38:01.666
You still got your money.

38:02.633 --> 38:04.401
Why are you here?

38:04.434 --> 38:06.003
Well, I had some family
business to take care of and

38:06.037 --> 38:07.905
I heard about
your little fiasco, so

38:08.239 --> 38:10.641
- I want to see the show.
- Show's over.

38:11.576 --> 38:14.712
We're all watching you, Chief.
We're all watching ya.

38:20.852 --> 38:22.553
We were badass, Timbo.

38:23.254 --> 38:26.023
There's only one team
I know that can pull this off.

38:28.993 --> 38:30.928
It didn't end
the way it started.

38:31.361 --> 38:34.832
Everything changed for everybody
that night, not just you, Tim.

38:35.199 --> 38:36.433
Everybody.

38:37.168 --> 38:40.037
We all had to disappear
into a city of people.

38:41.504 --> 38:43.641
Even if you're right...

38:54.819 --> 38:55.853
Oh, shit.

39:05.897 --> 39:07.765
- Good to see you, boys.
- Cap.

39:09.634 --> 39:10.735
You look like shit, LT.

39:13.704 --> 39:14.537
- Tim.
- Cap.

39:16.207 --> 39:17.041
How's Jeremy?

39:19.577 --> 39:20.510
He's happy.

39:21.178 --> 39:23.180
- He's 20.
- Wow.

39:24.682 --> 39:26.549
- Say no more.
- You all right?

39:27.484 --> 39:29.854
- No.
- She alive?

39:31.022 --> 39:32.790
- Yeah, she's alive.
- Where is she?

39:32.823 --> 39:33.891
I don't know.

39:35.793 --> 39:37.828
But Tyrone Pettis has her.

39:39.263 --> 39:41.766
If you sit still,
I'll have my guys take

39:41.799 --> 39:43.768
the tape off your mouth.

39:53.077 --> 39:54.078
Where's Conner?

39:57.581 --> 39:58.582
What are
you going to do with me?

39:59.317 --> 40:01.886
That depends on how
resourceful your husband is.

40:06.657 --> 40:08.893
- I need your help, please.
- When?

40:09.927 --> 40:11.062
Tonight.

40:14.598 --> 40:17.134
All right. Anybody else know?

40:17.168 --> 40:18.102
No one, just us.

40:22.206 --> 40:26.143
All right. We get the crew.
This is family.

40:27.011 --> 40:28.079
Family.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.014
Family is overrated.

40:31.682 --> 40:32.950
Not this fucking family.

40:46.664 --> 40:49.066
Mr. Miller, are you sure
you want to be here?

40:49.100 --> 40:49.967
Yes.

40:51.936 --> 40:53.671
If you want to reach
your full potential in life,

40:53.704 --> 40:54.605
you need to show up.

40:54.905 --> 40:56.140
Understood?

41:02.213 --> 41:03.681
Yeah, baby!

41:06.283 --> 41:08.886
Tommy says we need to get
a MacBook 2018.

41:08.919 --> 41:09.954
Nothin' else.

41:17.695 --> 41:19.096
Hold on there, darling, hang on.

41:22.833 --> 41:24.802
Excuse me, I need to take this.

41:27.338 --> 41:28.172
Who's this?

41:30.908 --> 41:35.746
Who is it? Damn, girl. Mason?
Man, fuck you.

41:41.085 --> 41:42.019
Mr. Miller, what are you doing?

41:43.754 --> 41:44.588
Showing up.

42:00.104 --> 42:02.907
- Where is everyone?
- You expected a surprise party?

42:07.945 --> 42:09.947
I know you raggedy
sons of bitches weren't

42:09.980 --> 42:11.782
about to
start a party without me.

42:11.816 --> 42:13.884
Boom! Conner, my man.

42:13.918 --> 42:14.919
Steve!

42:16.654 --> 42:17.988
Good to see you, man,
you're a sight for sore eyes.

42:19.423 --> 42:20.958
Hang in there,
we're gonna get her.

42:20.991 --> 42:22.059
Steve.

42:22.259 --> 42:23.661
- Hi there, Tim.
- Long time.

42:24.295 --> 42:26.363
- How are you, brother?
- Good to see you.

42:27.364 --> 42:28.899
Already started this early, man.

42:28.933 --> 42:29.867
Come on now,
we're gonna need ya.

42:31.335 --> 42:32.369
Cappy.

42:34.238 --> 42:37.074
- My motherfucking homies.
- Yeah. Dwayne.

42:37.108 --> 42:40.811
Dwayne.
Things never change. CPT.

42:40.845 --> 42:42.880
Don't make me
bust your ass, Tim.

42:45.116 --> 42:48.285
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you. Wassup?

42:48.319 --> 42:49.320
Thanks for coming.

42:52.423 --> 42:54.625
- Cap.
- Did you get we discussed?

42:56.727 --> 42:57.795
Let's see it.

43:06.070 --> 43:09.273
I pulled city code
blueprints of the property.

43:09.306 --> 43:11.842
Had a permit issued
for the room in the back.

43:11.876 --> 43:17.314
So exactly whose property
are we looking at and why?

43:17.348 --> 43:18.983
Conner. Why don't you tell 'em?

43:20.217 --> 43:21.652
This morning,

43:21.952 --> 43:25.122
I killed a banger who was
beating on one of my parolees.

43:26.290 --> 43:28.425
Turns out he was
one of Pettis's boys.

43:29.059 --> 43:30.394
Shit.

43:30.427 --> 43:32.730
Yeah, tell me about it.
They got Candace.

43:35.132 --> 43:36.967
- We need two mil.
- Could be a set up.

43:37.001 --> 43:38.435
No, if they wanted me dead,

43:38.702 --> 43:39.904
I'd be dead.

43:40.504 --> 43:42.773
Look, everything we've done
till now has been under

43:42.806 --> 43:44.008
the cover of the flag.

43:44.643 --> 43:47.144
Even when the Corps wasn't.
This ain't that, man.

43:47.178 --> 43:49.313
We got no cover.
This is outside the law.

43:49.947 --> 43:51.749
- You gotta know that.
- I'm all in.

43:52.216 --> 43:55.286
Last time I felt alive, was
the last time we were together.

43:56.086 --> 43:59.290
And no, shit didn't end
like we wanted, but fuck,

43:59.323 --> 44:00.157
when Cap called,

44:01.025 --> 44:02.059
that's all I needed.

44:05.162 --> 44:07.031
Well, I don't give
an aardvark's asshole

44:07.865 --> 44:09.233
why we got back together,

44:09.266 --> 44:10.901
I'm just glad
that we reunited boys.

44:11.435 --> 44:14.038
Okay. So what's the plan?

44:16.907 --> 44:20.344
At dark, DEA, smash and grab.

44:21.946 --> 44:23.180
Back by 2300.

44:24.315 --> 44:26.016
Well, you know what? There's
only one thing missing, then.

44:26.685 --> 44:28.919
We're gonna do all that,
we need guns.

44:28.953 --> 44:30.321
- Big fucking guns.
- Hell yeah,

44:30.354 --> 44:31.488
- that's what I'm talking about.
- Lots of 'em.

44:40.831 --> 44:41.865
Oh, yeah.

46:29.306 --> 46:30.575
Get on the motherfucking ground!

46:30.608 --> 46:31.975
Get on the mother...

46:39.450 --> 46:40.585
Get down!

46:45.322 --> 46:47.157
Get down! Don't move.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.527
Hey! Watch it!

46:59.704 --> 47:01.338
He's getting away!
Get him!

47:09.246 --> 47:11.248
Put your hands up!
Let her go!

47:20.190 --> 47:21.225
End of the line, motherfucker.

47:24.194 --> 47:25.429
Go ahead, D, say it?

47:25.797 --> 47:28.065
- You say it.
- Man, I'm redneck as fuck,

47:28.098 --> 47:29.933
you know I can't say it.
You say it mother fucker.

47:30.234 --> 47:33.537
Fine. D-E-motherfucking-A,

47:33.805 --> 47:35.105
my nigga.

47:35.139 --> 47:38.108
Fuck you!
Y'all ain't no police! Can't be!

47:38.142 --> 47:40.444
Sure, well you're right.
We ain't.

47:41.111 --> 47:42.546
Do you know
what the fuck we want?

47:42.580 --> 47:44.481
You have no idea
who you're robbing.

47:46.216 --> 47:47.551
- All right, let's go. Come on.
- The fuck.

47:58.262 --> 47:59.296
Got it.

48:04.201 --> 48:05.502
Somebody asked for money?

48:09.607 --> 48:11.241
I'm not letting that
shit hit the streets.

48:11.275 --> 48:12.409
Motherfuckers.

48:26.658 --> 48:27.692
Hey.

48:29.159 --> 48:30.294
All right, I'll be there in 20.

48:41.706 --> 48:44.174
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

48:45.108 --> 48:47.277
That wasn't fine back there,
man, what the fuck happened?

48:47.311 --> 48:48.412
I'm good bro, I'm good.

48:48.445 --> 48:51.148
Hey, hey. What happened?

48:56.286 --> 48:57.321
That night...

48:59.289 --> 49:01.525
- Does that ever get to you?
- What night?

49:02.526 --> 49:03.628
- You know what night.
- Yeah.

49:04.161 --> 49:07.197
I had to make a fucking call,
man. I did that.

49:08.332 --> 49:09.500
End of story.

49:10.434 --> 49:12.202
A lot of people died that night.

49:12.236 --> 49:14.037
Yeah, well they would
have fucking killed everybody.

49:15.506 --> 49:19.009
We saved lives.
We saved a lot of fucking lives.

49:20.177 --> 49:21.411
Now we move the fuck on.

49:23.413 --> 49:27.384
I sent my guys in to die,
and now I gotta live with that.

49:27.652 --> 49:29.186
You think I don't
live with that?

49:29.219 --> 49:31.255
You think every day, I don't
fucking think about that?

49:31.288 --> 49:32.690
Let me tell you something.

49:33.056 --> 49:34.759
When everything is on
the fucking line and you gotta

49:34.792 --> 49:37.595
make a decision
between death and death,

49:39.229 --> 49:41.465
there are no wrong choices.
None.

49:43.701 --> 49:44.535
D'you understand?

49:47.772 --> 49:48.640
Yeah.

49:50.374 --> 49:51.408
Let it go, man.

49:52.810 --> 49:54.144
Come on.

50:26.611 --> 50:28.178
What the fuck happened here?

50:35.753 --> 50:37.254
Fuckin' Pettis.

50:53.437 --> 50:54.672
You almost fucked everything up.

50:57.307 --> 50:58.342
What did...?

50:59.077 --> 51:01.545
Those cats came in there
looking like DEA.

51:01.579 --> 51:03.413
- How many?
- Five.

51:05.415 --> 51:06.450
Fuck.

51:09.486 --> 51:11.355
See their faces? Was it Pettis?

51:11.388 --> 51:12.557
I don't know.

51:12.590 --> 51:14.157
He claimed you were ready.

51:14.458 --> 51:16.928
I ain't gonna say nothing
about nothing. You can trust me.

51:16.961 --> 51:19.296
Just shut the fuck up,
you're not gonna say anything.

51:26.303 --> 51:27.605
Sorry, Danny.

51:35.245 --> 51:36.179
Hey, I need some help over here.

51:56.768 --> 51:58.468
- You want a hit?
- No.

52:00.705 --> 52:02.607
I'd appreciate it if
you didn't smoke that around me.

52:05.009 --> 52:07.679
You hear her?
Being all prudish and shit?

52:08.846 --> 52:12.416
Actually being all pregnant.
And shit.

52:13.918 --> 52:15.252
Oh yeah?

52:18.455 --> 52:19.590
I can respect that.

52:22.794 --> 52:23.828
Boy or girl?

52:24.494 --> 52:25.963
I don't know.
I just found out today.

52:29.332 --> 52:32.536
Put that shit out, nigga.
You heard she's pregnant.

52:37.307 --> 52:38.542
And, aw,

52:39.577 --> 52:42.880
mean old gangster Pettis
spoiled of your perfect day.

52:43.346 --> 52:46.550
- I mean, it's not that perfect.
- You mean there's cracks?

52:47.217 --> 52:49.654
Behind that white,
perfect picket fence?

52:50.487 --> 52:52.522
I mean nothing is perfect.

52:53.891 --> 52:55.893
We struggle
just like everybody else.

52:58.361 --> 52:59.630
Conner settles for this

53:00.530 --> 53:02.532
low-grade job when
I know he's much more.

53:05.036 --> 53:07.370
How's that for
a role model for my baby?

53:12.409 --> 53:13.243
Do you have kids?

53:16.513 --> 53:19.516
- Do you have a family?
- Streets of my family.

53:21.619 --> 53:23.621
My so-called mom

53:24.055 --> 53:25.990
left me on a corner
shortly after I was born.

53:26.891 --> 53:27.792
I'm sorry.

53:33.064 --> 53:35.332
- Yeah?
- The fuck did you do?

53:35.365 --> 53:37.501
- When?
- Don't insult me.

53:37.902 --> 53:40.738
I told you the Southside,
it was off limits.

53:41.005 --> 53:42.439
You did.

53:43.306 --> 53:46.978
And I'm here, in my office,
after hours, mindin' my business

53:47.511 --> 53:49.580
wondering
why the chief of police

53:49.781 --> 53:52.382
is calling me
fucking with my high.

53:52.415 --> 53:54.886
Don't forget why
you're in that office.

53:54.919 --> 53:56.587
<i>I helped you get it.</i>

53:56.621 --> 53:58.956
I could help you lose it,
fucking jerk-off.

54:05.930 --> 54:09.600
Well, looks like your man
is coming to get his lady.

54:10.868 --> 54:13.771
And his baby. How's that
for positive role model?

54:22.479 --> 54:24.381
Well, I must say,

54:24.414 --> 54:26.818
was an honor suiting up
with you motherfuckers again.

54:26.851 --> 54:28.986
Don't go getting all sappy
on us now, Cap.

54:29.020 --> 54:29.854
What's the take?

54:30.755 --> 54:33.624
1875, three zeros.

54:35.126 --> 54:35.960
Not enough

54:37.028 --> 54:38.395
That's all right,
that's all right.

54:38.428 --> 54:39.730
Just take your cuts,
all right?

54:39.764 --> 54:44.068
Hey, hey, hey, I'm here for you,
man. Not the money.

54:50.174 --> 54:52.977
- Start a college fund.
- Well, you know, uh,

54:55.046 --> 54:56.848
I could use a new single-wide.

54:57.315 --> 54:59.016
- I bet you could.
- Stare at Becky

54:59.050 --> 55:00.651
on the back porch,
but tell you what,

55:01.085 --> 55:03.054
we're here for you.
I love you, brother.

55:03.453 --> 55:04.956
You... you missing what's
happening over here?

55:07.959 --> 55:08.993
I quit my job.

55:09.293 --> 55:10.828
We didn't tell you
to quit your job.

55:11.128 --> 55:13.598
Man, you white boys are crazy.

55:22.006 --> 55:23.473
I thought you might be dead.

55:23.708 --> 55:26.811
- Put her on.
- What? My word isn't solid?

55:27.444 --> 55:28.511
No, it's not.

55:29.080 --> 55:31.816
If you want your money,
prove she's alive.

55:33.684 --> 55:34.819
As you wish, cowboy.

55:39.624 --> 55:40.725
Say hi.

55:43.694 --> 55:45.029
Hello.

55:45.062 --> 55:47.497
Baby? We're comin'
to get you, baby.

55:47.530 --> 55:48.699
- Conner.
- <i>Candace!</i>

55:48.733 --> 55:50.034
Don't you fucking hurt her!

55:50.334 --> 55:53.037
I'll text you the address.
You come with any cops,

55:53.536 --> 55:55.172
I think you know the deal.

55:55.206 --> 55:56.941
Don't you fucking hurt her.

56:02.580 --> 56:03.681
So what we gonna do?

56:04.348 --> 56:06.684
I'ma get my money
and let her go.

56:06.717 --> 56:08.485
So you still trust
these white boys?

56:08.686 --> 56:11.822
- One of them.
- Man, he's a snake too.

56:11.856 --> 56:14.158
They all snakes
and they gonna bite us

56:14.191 --> 56:15.626
in the ass if we let him go.

56:15.893 --> 56:18.095
We? Us?

56:19.563 --> 56:21.531
Motherfucker,
this is my operation.

56:22.233 --> 56:23.801
And I don't appreciate
you questioning me.

56:27.204 --> 56:28.806
Lemme ask you a question.

56:29.874 --> 56:31.208
- You hungry?
- No, sir.

56:32.176 --> 56:33.210
Do you want for anything?

56:33.878 --> 56:35.046
No.

56:35.079 --> 56:37.048
Then when I tell you
what the deal is,

56:37.081 --> 56:38.649
I don't wanna hear
the way it might be.

56:43.287 --> 56:44.487
Understood.

56:45.522 --> 56:46.557
That's my bad.

56:48.626 --> 56:50.995
But I've been riding with you
since you started this shit.

56:51.729 --> 56:53.530
And I'm gonna
tell you like this,

56:53.764 --> 56:57.935
if we let these white boys live,
none of this shit gonna matter.

56:59.536 --> 57:02.740
'Cause we gonna be upstate.
Doing life.

57:03.473 --> 57:05.576
And I might not be
around to protect you.

57:11.649 --> 57:14.018
- You don't have to do that.
- You stop being nosy.

57:16.821 --> 57:17.955
You were right.

57:20.157 --> 57:21.125
Help us.

57:23.027 --> 57:24.795
Let us leave, go somewhere where

57:24.829 --> 57:26.764
we don't have to look over
our shoulder every night.

57:28.099 --> 57:29.499
You want me to help you?

57:30.134 --> 57:31.936
You're not here
because you're stupid.

57:33.938 --> 57:36.874
He's not wrong, leaving
witnesses would be stupid.

57:39.176 --> 57:41.846
But we leave,
and there wouldn't be any.

57:45.716 --> 57:47.685
There's only one way
to guarantee they don't talk.

57:55.993 --> 57:57.795
You sure
I can't change your mind?

57:57.828 --> 58:01.699
No, sir. He has all the leverage
and no reason to escalate.

58:01.732 --> 58:03.167
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

58:03.968 --> 58:05.535
Doesn't make sense.

58:06.704 --> 58:07.905
Me and Tim got this.

58:08.506 --> 58:10.207
All right, you need me,
I'm at the ready.

58:10.241 --> 58:12.343
All right? Let me know
when you have her.

58:12.376 --> 58:13.577
I will.

58:25.756 --> 58:27.925
Danny Fields is the largest
drug dealer on the Southside.

58:28.392 --> 58:30.728
This hit was done
with power and precision

58:30.761 --> 58:32.596
and the fact that they did
not take the drugs leads me

58:32.630 --> 58:33.998
to believe that
it was not their rival.

58:34.398 --> 58:36.067
We'll interview Danny
when he gets there.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.868
Danny's dead.

58:39.904 --> 58:41.272
- Fuckin' heart attack.
- What?

58:42.006 --> 58:44.909
- You didn't use the 'fibs?
- He was loaded with drugs.

58:47.144 --> 58:48.345
OK.

58:48.379 --> 58:50.147
They were dressed as DEA.
Talked to the feds,

58:50.181 --> 58:51.015
they haven't run
anything around here.

58:52.216 --> 58:54.085
They scrubbed the walls
and the buckets,

58:54.518 --> 58:56.287
took a million worth
of dope off the streets.

58:57.188 --> 59:00.658
So my question is,
are we looking to arrest them

59:01.258 --> 59:02.293
or commend them?

59:02.726 --> 59:05.262
- Any leads?
- Nah, they're ghosts.

59:05.596 --> 59:08.232
We found two dancers,
patrol's bringing them in now.

59:08.432 --> 59:10.634
Oh, Christ.

59:10.668 --> 59:12.069
This is a waste of time.

59:15.072 --> 59:16.107
Get me something real.

59:21.078 --> 59:22.646
Something is wrong with Chief.

59:23.781 --> 59:25.015
He's stressed.

59:26.417 --> 59:27.651
Nah.

59:28.853 --> 59:30.054
He's different.

59:31.956 --> 59:33.257
I said he's stressed.

59:41.932 --> 59:43.000
You hungry?

59:46.270 --> 59:47.638
Get me a fish sandwich, man.

59:48.506 --> 59:51.175
- Who.
- You, nigga! What you mean who?

59:52.776 --> 59:53.844
All right.

59:55.146 --> 59:56.714
This is that bullshit.

01:00:08.859 --> 01:00:10.127
I'm going to relieve myself.

01:00:11.328 --> 01:00:12.930
Let you do the same
when I get back.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:14.198
Thanks.

01:00:38.389 --> 01:00:41.225
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

01:00:42.393 --> 01:00:44.028
hallowed be Thy name.

01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:20.064
Shit.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.076
There's only
one way in and out of here.

01:01:33.944 --> 01:01:36.380
Anybody want to get at me,
they better come face to face!

01:02:27.097 --> 01:02:28.265
This can get ugly.

01:02:36.106 --> 01:02:37.274
You thought of any names?

01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:39.443
No, not yet.

01:02:40.277 --> 01:02:42.413
If it's a boy, I like Tim.

01:02:44.882 --> 01:02:46.050
That's not bad.

01:02:48.485 --> 01:02:49.987
Conner Junior,
that's not bad either.

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:54.158
Girl?

01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:57.061
Millie.

01:02:59.229 --> 01:03:01.198
- Grandma.
- Yeah.

01:03:04.435 --> 01:03:05.536
Why didn't you go
to Mom's funeral?

01:03:07.404 --> 01:03:08.439
I was in a dark place.

01:03:11.508 --> 01:03:13.143
I gotta tell you something,
Conner.

01:03:13.177 --> 01:03:15.012
Don't, don't.

01:03:15.512 --> 01:03:18.048
Everyone fucks up.
Don't worry about it.

01:03:23.921 --> 01:03:26.023
This may end bad, you're right.

01:03:27.925 --> 01:03:29.026
But if it does,

01:03:31.228 --> 01:03:33.864
there's nobody I'd rather
go out fighting with.

01:03:38.969 --> 01:03:41.939
Hey, do you mind stopping
up here? I need to take a piss.

01:03:41.972 --> 01:03:43.006
Yeah.

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.244
This is Mason.

01:03:47.277 --> 01:03:48.278
<i>Since you're in town,</i>

01:03:48.312 --> 01:03:50.080
<i>I need you and your team.</i>

01:03:50.582 --> 01:03:53.317
We don't work anymore.
You know this.

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:56.688
<i>Are you sure?
A drug house was hit</i>

01:03:56.721 --> 01:04:00.457
<i>with, uh, military precision,
took a lot of money.</i>

01:04:00.491 --> 01:04:03.026
Like I said,
we don't work no more.

01:04:03.728 --> 01:04:06.296
<i>I would hate for your
role in the hostage crisis</i>

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:07.364
<i>to be made public.</i>

01:04:08.733 --> 01:04:11.969
I was trained for war.
I fight to win.

01:04:12.002 --> 01:04:13.036
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:04:13.303 --> 01:04:14.639
If it comes down to me or you,

01:04:14.672 --> 01:04:18.342
it's gonna be me
every fucking time.

01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:21.245
<i>Do you think anybody
is gonna believe you over me?</i>

01:04:24.716 --> 01:04:28.552
Hey, remember one thing.
No such thing as off the record,

01:04:30.421 --> 01:04:31.522
Captain.

01:04:36.393 --> 01:04:37.695
- <i>Hello?</i>
- En route?

01:04:37.729 --> 01:04:39.263
<i>Hell no, I'm not coming!</i>

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:41.532
Becky's here raisin' seven kinds
of hell

01:04:41.566 --> 01:04:43.033
- all over this shit...
- ...off the goddamned phone...

01:04:43.066 --> 01:04:44.435
What?

01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:48.272
Oh, fuck.

01:04:49.607 --> 01:04:50.742
Shit.

01:04:50.775 --> 01:04:52.276
- No!
- God damn, I can't hear

01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:53.645
myself think.
Hello, Mason, listen.

01:05:59.844 --> 01:06:02.580
All right, come on, let's go.
Let's go, come on.

01:06:06.116 --> 01:06:07.752
Better? Let's do this.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.814
See a white girl pass by here?

01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:40.384
Everybody pack up and clock out.

01:06:48.358 --> 01:06:50.394
- Girl, what's going on?
- I don't know.

01:06:59.503 --> 01:07:00.838
Clock out, now.

01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:03.540
Oh, yes sir.

01:08:11.274 --> 01:08:14.378
You're fucking pregnant. I don't
want to hurt you, but I will.

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:22.620
This is what a nigga gets for
trying to be nice to a bitch.

01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:40.837
I'm here to see Tyrone Pettis.

01:08:42.707 --> 01:08:43.540
I got his money.

01:08:59.389 --> 01:09:01.224
- Two clicks out.
- Aye, aye.

01:09:02.026 --> 01:09:04.662
I didn't want to activate
the tracker on Connolly, but,

01:09:05.095 --> 01:09:06.496
I can't leave a soldier behind.

01:09:09.265 --> 01:09:10.399
Are you ready?

01:09:12.301 --> 01:09:13.970
- Let's go get her.
- Let's do it.

01:09:23.581 --> 01:09:24.816
Yo, take their straps, man.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.622
- Get the bags. Let's go.
- Come on, this way.

01:10:49.967 --> 01:10:51.569
All right, I'm here.
Where's my wife?

01:10:51.602 --> 01:10:52.703
Shh!

01:10:58.776 --> 01:11:01.746
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:04.048
Haiti hasn't beaten
the US in football in 20 years.

01:11:06.617 --> 01:11:07.752
But back to business.

01:11:13.691 --> 01:11:14.725
Count it.

01:11:16.493 --> 01:11:17.795
The deal is
once I get my two million,

01:11:17.829 --> 01:11:18.663
you get to see her.

01:11:20.965 --> 01:11:23.466
That's after
the count is confirmed.

01:11:23.701 --> 01:11:25.002
I wanna see her right now.

01:11:25.036 --> 01:11:27.470
You don't make
fucking demands to me!

01:11:28.139 --> 01:11:29.707
I will have you both
killed where you stand.

01:11:30.942 --> 01:11:32.844
Well, I know you killed Joaquin.

01:11:32.877 --> 01:11:34.779
So? That little bastard
stole from me.

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:36.647
I consider that unacceptable.

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:40.084
One point eight-five.

01:11:40.117 --> 01:11:42.720
- That was fast.
- We count millions on millions.

01:11:42.987 --> 01:11:45.455
- I know the count.
- So you're short.

01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:48.659
Maybe. We took what was there.

01:11:49.227 --> 01:11:53.430
I also took a million dollars
worth of product off the street.

01:11:54.098 --> 01:11:55.498
That's gotta
have some value to you.

01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:02.707
Follow me.

01:12:09.446 --> 01:12:11.749
- Baby. Baby!
- Conner. Conner.

01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:16.419
- Did they hurt you?
- They're not gonna let us go.

01:12:21.458 --> 01:12:22.894
Thank you, thank you kindly.

01:12:24.662 --> 01:12:25.663
For what?

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:29.399
Oh shit, somebody here
doesn't know.

01:12:29.834 --> 01:12:31.068
Doesn't know what?

01:12:31.736 --> 01:12:34.605
How do you think I knew
who you were when I saw you?

01:12:34.839 --> 01:12:36.506
How do you think I knew
where you had breakfast

01:12:36.539 --> 01:12:37.174
in the morning?

01:12:38.276 --> 01:12:41.045
How do you think I knew
you were the perfect person

01:12:41.078 --> 01:12:43.781
to knock off my competitor
without it getting back to me?

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:47.718
I don't know
what he's talking about, okay?

01:12:47.752 --> 01:12:50.520
I got one, two, three bullets

01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:53.858
that say you know exactly
what the fuck I'm talking about.

01:13:03.868 --> 01:13:04.902
Remember, we had to disappear.

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:08.906
No job, no family.

01:13:10.942 --> 01:13:12.810
- Jesus, Tim.
- Look at this shit.

01:13:12.843 --> 01:13:13.911
Look at my veins.

01:13:16.147 --> 01:13:20.051
Him. He supplied it.
I couldn't pay him. Now I owe.

01:13:23.621 --> 01:13:24.487
You owe him?

01:13:25.522 --> 01:13:26.958
I'm your fucking brother.

01:13:26.991 --> 01:13:28.960
Oh shit, the Brady Bunch
up in this bitch.

01:13:28.993 --> 01:13:30.493
Because of you,

01:13:31.228 --> 01:13:33.998
I can't fucking sleep at night.

01:13:35.066 --> 01:13:36.734
I see his fucking face.

01:13:36.767 --> 01:13:38.169
It haunts me every...

01:13:38.202 --> 01:13:40.037
- You know it wasn't my call!
- Every night!

01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:42.640
It wasn't my call!
I was taking orders.

01:13:42.673 --> 01:13:44.108
Hold on, what?
What fucking orders?

01:13:45.009 --> 01:13:46.509
Brownsville Road standoff.

01:13:46.543 --> 01:13:48.846
- We were taking orders.
- Hold up.

01:13:49.313 --> 01:13:53.084
You were the ghosts
that killed my people that day?

01:13:53.718 --> 01:13:55.552
I thought you was
washed up in Afghanistan.

01:13:56.854 --> 01:13:59.256
That's the official story.
Unofficially...

01:14:00.091 --> 01:14:01.759
we did the dirty work
for Uncle Sam.

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:07.131
That was my high school
fucking teacher.

01:14:07.164 --> 01:14:10.267
My basketball coach. Only people
I cared about the fucking world.

01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:13.070
I was the one that triggered
that blast. It was me.

01:14:13.104 --> 01:14:15.639
Well maybe it's you who should
take this bullet in the head.

01:14:15.673 --> 01:14:20.845
No. No. Right fucking here.
Put it right fucking here.

01:14:24.782 --> 01:14:25.816
Just let them go.

01:14:26.484 --> 01:14:30.154
Aw. Got some Cain
and Abel shit up in here.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.523
Don't be too sorry. Baby brother
didn't really have a choice.

01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:36.160
Some deaths
are played by ,

01:14:37.194 --> 01:14:38.562
and some by skill.

01:14:39.663 --> 01:14:40.731
Let them go.

01:14:46.637 --> 01:14:47.872
I got my money.

01:14:48.973 --> 01:14:50.074
I never want to see them again.

01:14:52.243 --> 01:14:53.711
Bro, you going soft?

01:14:55.146 --> 01:14:56.614
Use your head.

01:14:57.314 --> 01:14:59.850
They just knocked off our
competitors on the Southside.

01:14:59.884 --> 01:15:01.318
They're dead on the streets.

01:15:01.352 --> 01:15:03.087
We don't need to do this shit.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.855
Bro, I'm not getting bit
by these...

01:15:23.107 --> 01:15:24.341
Look out!
Come on, baby!

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:32.016
Let's go, let's get outta here!

01:15:33.751 --> 01:15:34.919
Come on.

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:21.265
Baby. Tim!

01:16:24.802 --> 01:16:25.636
Oh, my gosh.

01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:27.371
Conner, you good?

01:16:27.404 --> 01:16:29.306
- Fuck you, Tim, he's bleeding.
- Get off.

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.375
- Gotta move.
- Get the fuck off of him!

01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:33.811
Listen!
Pettis just wants his money.

01:16:34.044 --> 01:16:35.746
Your debt, my debt, paid.

01:16:35.779 --> 01:16:37.014
This was not supposed to happen.

01:16:37.047 --> 01:16:39.817
Please, I'm fighting here,
for you, with you.

01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:41.252
Okay? We can do this.

01:16:41.285 --> 01:16:43.320
Come on, get up, we can do this.
We got this.

01:16:43.354 --> 01:16:45.022
Come here, baby.

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:48.692
Go, go, go.

01:16:49.628 --> 01:16:53.964
Everybody aim, when I say shoot,
keep your finger on the trigger.

01:16:54.298 --> 01:16:56.800
don't let go
until everyone is dead.

01:16:58.502 --> 01:16:59.737
One.

01:17:02.439 --> 01:17:04.108
- Two.
- Go.

01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:05.876
Clear! Clear!
Clear! Clear!

01:17:09.113 --> 01:17:11.782
Oh shit, y'all know
you're happy to see me.

01:17:11.815 --> 01:17:14.185
- I told you we got this.
- Yeah, I can see that.

01:17:14.218 --> 01:17:16.220
Pettis is still alive,
he's in the back.

01:17:17.321 --> 01:17:18.355
All right.

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.891
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:17:21.325 --> 01:17:23.727
One, two, go.

01:17:26.530 --> 01:17:27.765
Move.

01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:20.050
I'm unarmed!

01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:23.787
- I'm coming out!
- Hands, hands, hands!

01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:25.189
Let me see your fucking hands!

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:35.065
This is the piece of shit
that's causing all the trouble?

01:18:35.099 --> 01:18:36.967
- Yeah.
- Piece of shit?

01:18:38.269 --> 01:18:41.305
I deal not in my worth,
in yours.

01:18:41.338 --> 01:18:42.806
Yeah, but you kill your own.

01:18:43.107 --> 01:18:44.141
You killed Joaquin.

01:18:44.341 --> 01:18:45.409
Don't you fucking preach to me.

01:18:46.844 --> 01:18:48.445
This country
is built on fucking crime,

01:18:48.747 --> 01:18:52.549
fucking settlers.
Slavery, thieves.

01:18:52.584 --> 01:18:55.352
Forbes family got rich
off of trading opium.

01:18:56.621 --> 01:18:59.423
You know what
they make with opium? Heroin.

01:19:00.157 --> 01:19:02.426
And then they put
politicians in there

01:19:02.459 --> 01:19:04.495
to make it illegal
to protect their wealth.

01:19:05.462 --> 01:19:09.466
Every day in this country,
they seize drug money.

01:19:10.267 --> 01:19:13.103
You think they burn that shit?
Hell fucking no.

01:19:13.137 --> 01:19:15.306
You a fucking drug dealer
or a history teacher,

01:19:15.339 --> 01:19:18.242
- you hypocrite mother fucker?
- Why am I hypocrite?

01:19:19.543 --> 01:19:22.446
Because I make money
same way white folks do?

01:19:22.479 --> 01:19:25.282
- And help my community? Huh?
- Yeah.

01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:28.285
I'll fucking shoot
you in the face man.

01:19:28.319 --> 01:19:31.121
Go ahead. Kill me.

01:19:31.155 --> 01:19:32.557
I'll put a bullet
right through you.

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:35.125
Yeah. And Alston will come
down on you like hell.

01:19:35.593 --> 01:19:37.194
Say what?

01:19:37.227 --> 01:19:40.364
I said Alston will come down
on you like hell.

01:19:40.397 --> 01:19:41.633
You working with Alston?

01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:43.400
The fuck do you know?
I made that motherfucker.

01:19:43.802 --> 01:19:45.135
Yeah, he's crooked

01:19:45.502 --> 01:19:48.439
but at least he gave a shit
about that school

01:19:48.472 --> 01:19:50.174
and them kids
that you fucking killed.

01:19:50.507 --> 01:19:54.044
Alston killed those kids
he made the order,

01:19:54.078 --> 01:19:55.446
- we carried it out.
- Bullshit.

01:19:55.479 --> 01:19:56.914
Bullshit?

01:19:57.181 --> 01:19:58.982
You think a ghost team
is running around,

01:19:59.016 --> 01:20:00.351
not taking orders
from the brass?

01:20:00.384 --> 01:20:01.619
You think they don't know
what the fuck is happening?

01:20:01.653 --> 01:20:03.053
Are you stupid?

01:20:03.087 --> 01:20:06.056
Good story,
soldier boy. Prove it.

01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:08.593
"Prove it." I ain't gonna prove
a motherfucking thing to you.

01:20:08.992 --> 01:20:12.162
I got the gun, I'm gonna take
him down and probably you too.

01:20:13.631 --> 01:20:15.165
You ain't got shit on me.

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:17.901
I don't leave loose ends.

01:20:18.435 --> 01:20:19.870
Let me tell you
something about Alston.

01:20:20.605 --> 01:20:22.206
He's been
fucking stealing from us.

01:20:22.674 --> 01:20:24.375
He's been stealing from you.

01:20:24.408 --> 01:20:26.377
Most of all, he's been stealing
from those kids for a long time.

01:20:28.011 --> 01:20:30.481
I'm a lot of things.
I ain't a liar.

01:20:30.514 --> 01:20:32.617
How the fuck do you think
he got reelected?

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:34.485
With my fucking money
is how he got elected.

01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:42.960
Maybe it's time
we steal from him.

01:20:44.161 --> 01:20:45.362
We?

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:47.064
There ain't no we.

01:20:47.531 --> 01:20:49.066
I'm not with you,
you're not with me...

01:20:49.099 --> 01:20:51.068
Captain. I don't trust
this fucking guy.

01:20:51.101 --> 01:20:52.970
Connolly, what choice do you
fucking have?

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:56.240
You sound crazy as shit.
That ain't happening.

01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:58.576
Tell us the location.

01:20:59.009 --> 01:21:00.444
And we'll go get it.

01:21:00.712 --> 01:21:02.647
What the fuck
do I look like to you, huh?

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.515
My knowledge, my rules.

01:21:04.948 --> 01:21:05.983
How do you know all this?

01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:07.951
Been clocking Alston for years.

01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:09.253
Always had a Plan B.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.525
He won't move his money
again for another six months.

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:17.194
He'll have his crew there
before the bank opens at 6:30.

01:21:17.562 --> 01:21:20.531
That gives us a two-hour
window starting 30 minutes ago.

01:21:25.169 --> 01:21:28.205
I need you to arrange
transport before the bank opens.

01:21:28.238 --> 01:21:31.175
No, no, nothing to worry about,
just a precaution.

01:21:35.279 --> 01:21:37.281
<i>He moves his money
like a snake,</i>

01:21:37.314 --> 01:21:39.116
<i>in plain sight,
hidden in the weeds.</i>

01:21:40.217 --> 01:21:43.120
<i>Right now he has legit guards
and an armored hearse.</i>

01:21:43.153 --> 01:21:44.756
<i>Security is always the same.</i>

01:21:44.789 --> 01:21:47.291
<i>The driver and the hopper.
The driver never leaves.</i>

01:21:47.324 --> 01:21:48.593
<i>His partner is the hopper.</i>

01:21:49.226 --> 01:21:51.462
<i>Every inch is bulletproof.</i>

01:21:51.495 --> 01:21:54.097
<i>With all that protection,
there are blind spots.</i>

01:21:55.299 --> 01:21:57.267
Police guarded armored car

01:21:57.301 --> 01:21:59.536
belongs to
a corrupt police chief. Guys.

01:21:59.571 --> 01:22:02.239
No, it's true.
Time is not on our side.

01:22:02.272 --> 01:22:03.307
Follow me.

01:22:05.142 --> 01:22:06.276
We got speed.

01:22:06.543 --> 01:22:09.046
We got the element of
surprise and we got violence.

01:22:09.681 --> 01:22:12.015
Now it's time to bring all three
of these mother fuckers.

01:22:12.516 --> 01:22:14.151
Why didn't you come out
blastin'?

01:22:14.551 --> 01:22:16.621
Against you Rambo
motherfuckers on steroids?

01:22:16.987 --> 01:22:18.522
Hell motherfucking no.

01:22:18.723 --> 01:22:20.390
My cousin
sells birth certificates,

01:22:20.758 --> 01:22:21.992
real estate sales
and everything.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.127
You can be who you want to be.

01:22:24.963 --> 01:22:27.765
Whether this goes good or bad,
we're on our own.

01:22:27.799 --> 01:22:29.801
I just want to pull a curtain
back on this motherfucker.

01:22:33.237 --> 01:22:35.372
- Without a doubt.
- Yeah, why not?

01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:45.148
Y'all ain't wearing
that dusty ass gear around me.

01:22:45.182 --> 01:22:46.483
I do everything in style.

01:22:51.188 --> 01:22:53.056
Why are you the first face
I'm seeing right now?

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:54.324
I've been looking at the chief.

01:22:54.358 --> 01:22:56.460
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:22:56.493 --> 01:22:58.462
- Stuff doesn't add up.
- What doesn't add up

01:22:58.495 --> 01:23:00.197
is you worrying about
our boss when we have

01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:01.833
this fucking case going on.
Get your head in the game.

01:23:01.866 --> 01:23:04.401
- Please, man, listen to me.
- Enough, Reynolds.

01:23:04.836 --> 01:23:06.704
Do you hear me?
Enough.

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:12.543
You fuck us,

01:23:13.343 --> 01:23:14.679
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your face.

01:23:15.245 --> 01:23:17.247
Just don't get
any blood on the suit.

01:23:49.346 --> 01:23:52.082
- Surveillance without us?
- Why did you get in my car?

01:23:53.250 --> 01:23:55.185
Why is the hearse
sitting at the bank?

01:23:55.218 --> 01:23:56.520
And why do you care, Alston?

01:23:56.553 --> 01:23:58.121
'Cause I'm the fucking boss,
man.

01:23:58.422 --> 01:23:59.891
Why are you sitting
in front of this bank,

01:23:59.924 --> 01:24:01.826
the only bank
that's not open yet,

01:24:01.859 --> 01:24:03.527
and moving money
at the same time?

01:24:03.561 --> 01:24:05.362
- I don't like your tone.
- I don't like your stealth act.

01:24:05.395 --> 01:24:07.565
And I don't like key witnesses
dying under your custody.

01:24:07.599 --> 01:24:09.266
And I don't like
feeling like my boss

01:24:09.466 --> 01:24:10.835
is more concerned
about himself than justice.

01:24:32.422 --> 01:24:33.457
Motherfucker.

01:24:35.225 --> 01:24:36.360
We're compromised.

01:24:36.393 --> 01:24:37.394
Damn,
we went in too hot.

01:25:01.284 --> 01:25:01.919
Move! Move!

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:07.892
- Cover me!
- I got cover.

01:25:07.925 --> 01:25:08.926
I got cover.

01:25:16.299 --> 01:25:19.269
Go get the bags.
Get the money.

01:25:22.573 --> 01:25:23.708
We got company.

01:25:23.741 --> 01:25:24.809
<i>We have you surrounded!</i>

01:25:24.842 --> 01:25:26.577
You and I are
gonna finish this later.

01:25:26.911 --> 01:25:28.880
<i>I repeat,
put your weapons down!</i>

01:25:28.913 --> 01:25:30.247
Let's put an end to
this shit.

01:25:37.655 --> 01:25:38.790
Get over here.

01:25:38.823 --> 01:25:40.257
Give it up now,

01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:41.559
and I'll make sure that
you get the chair quick.

01:25:51.301 --> 01:25:53.905
Dwayne!
Dwayne has been shot. Shit!

01:25:53.938 --> 01:25:56.306
Tim, get him!

01:26:02.914 --> 01:26:04.982
Tim, I need you,
let's go.

01:26:06.751 --> 01:26:09.954
He's gone! He's gone! Stay
focused! Let's go. Come on!

01:26:09.987 --> 01:26:11.354
I need cover!

01:26:11.388 --> 01:26:12.222
Get cover!

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.729
We didn't come here
to kill cops.

01:26:17.762 --> 01:26:19.697
Fuck them!
They shot D.

01:26:21.331 --> 01:26:22.466
We have you surrounded,

01:26:22.499 --> 01:26:23.634
put your weapons down.

01:26:23.668 --> 01:26:24.969
I repeat, put your weapons down.

01:26:26.938 --> 01:26:27.905
Fuck that!

01:26:41.551 --> 01:26:42.754
We're outnumbered!

01:27:00.037 --> 01:27:01.404
Go in the motherfucking bank.

01:27:02.774 --> 01:27:04.842
Go, go, go!
Go get the bags!

01:27:04.876 --> 01:27:06.543
- I'll cover you.
- Go!

01:27:06.577 --> 01:27:07.678
Pettis, grab the bags!

01:27:08.179 --> 01:27:09.614
go, go! Into the bank!

01:27:17.487 --> 01:27:18.756
Pettis! Go, go!

01:27:22.392 --> 01:27:23.527
Freeze!

01:27:38.843 --> 01:27:41.411
Get out now, get out. Go!

01:27:41.444 --> 01:27:43.080
Everybody in the room!
Everybody in the room!

01:27:43.114 --> 01:27:44.949
What, do you think I'm just
talking to Black people?

01:27:44.982 --> 01:27:47.084
Get your ass in here.
Everybody in that room.

01:27:47.118 --> 01:27:48.518
Everybody in that room now!

01:27:49.687 --> 01:27:51.589
Gimme the keys! Gimme the keys!

01:27:54.959 --> 01:27:56.627
Elevator's clear
power's down.

01:27:56.661 --> 01:27:57.795
What next?

01:27:57.829 --> 01:27:58.830
We got SWAT in the back.

01:28:00.798 --> 01:28:01.632
Shit.

01:28:03.167 --> 01:28:04.501
Power's down.

01:28:27.158 --> 01:28:28.826
Come out with your hands up.

01:28:33.631 --> 01:28:34.732
They brought
the whole department.

01:28:37.034 --> 01:28:39.036
Trust me, they don't want
none of us to talk.

01:28:42.139 --> 01:28:43.373
Cap.

01:28:45.042 --> 01:28:47.879
I had my three seconds.
Your time now.

01:28:53.851 --> 01:28:54.819
When you're going through hell,

01:28:56.654 --> 01:28:58.856
- you keep going.
- Churchill.

01:29:03.094 --> 01:29:04.729
All right, Timbo,
you come with me,

01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:06.130
we're gonna get the back.

01:29:06.163 --> 01:29:08.032
Pettis, you go with the captain.
You guys got the front.

01:29:09.499 --> 01:29:10.533
Let's do this.

01:29:14.504 --> 01:29:15.673
Go, go, go.

01:29:36.027 --> 01:29:37.028
Come on, I'll cover you.

01:29:40.965 --> 01:29:42.532
Oh, fuck!

01:29:47.605 --> 01:29:48.438
Moving in.

01:29:57.615 --> 01:29:58.582
Come out, motherfucker.

01:30:14.131 --> 01:30:14.966
Shit!

01:30:21.272 --> 01:30:22.505
Fuck. I'm out!

01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:26.944
I'm out too.

01:30:29.814 --> 01:30:30.848
Getting low.

01:30:38.789 --> 01:30:41.158
Last mag! Last mag.

01:31:05.316 --> 01:31:06.549
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:31:08.285 --> 01:31:09.186
I'm gonna try and get an angle.

01:31:09.887 --> 01:31:10.888
Stay put.

01:31:21.232 --> 01:31:22.900
- Shit.
- Fuck.

01:31:28.239 --> 01:31:29.539
He's hit!

01:31:30.841 --> 01:31:32.243
What can I do? Huh?

01:31:32.943 --> 01:31:34.612
I'm gonna get you
some help, okay?

01:31:35.146 --> 01:31:36.180
Conner.

01:31:38.049 --> 01:31:40.785
Save... save my niece.

01:31:41.318 --> 01:31:42.987
- No, no, stay with me.
- Save my niece.

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.089
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

01:31:50.027 --> 01:31:50.995
He's dead!

01:31:53.664 --> 01:31:54.799
Fuck.

01:32:10.381 --> 01:32:11.348
I love you, Timbo.

01:32:17.688 --> 01:32:18.856
No, Tim...

01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:00.764
Get outta there!

01:33:19.416 --> 01:33:21.152
Hot damn,
I've always wanted to

01:33:21.185 --> 01:33:22.353
Dukes of Hazzard
some shit like that.

01:33:23.988 --> 01:33:25.256
Figured you boys
might need these.

01:33:27.825 --> 01:33:29.326
Let's go all right, come on,
let's go. Where's... where's Tim?

01:33:32.763 --> 01:33:33.797
Dwayne?

01:33:34.665 --> 01:33:36.734
All right, fuck it. Let's go,
let's go, follow me out.

01:33:36.767 --> 01:33:37.768
Let's go, now!

01:33:38.169 --> 01:33:39.303
Go!

01:33:39.336 --> 01:33:40.471
All right, fine,

01:33:40.504 --> 01:33:42.039
let's get the fuck out of here.
Let's go!

01:33:42.072 --> 01:33:43.274
Let's go, let's go!

01:33:43.307 --> 01:33:44.708
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:01.725
- See you in another life.
- Stay safe.

01:34:03.827 --> 01:34:04.962
- Love you.
- I love you too.

01:34:05.863 --> 01:34:07.498
How the fuck
do we get out of here?

01:34:07.531 --> 01:34:10.334
Push the car. I have
the bank manager's keys.

01:34:12.369 --> 01:34:13.938
- Let's take his car.
- Which car?

01:34:20.778 --> 01:34:21.912
What fucking car?

01:34:21.946 --> 01:34:23.280
I don't know which car.

01:34:23.314 --> 01:34:24.215
It's the Prius.
Come on, let's go.

01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:27.017
Come on.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.421
I'll take it from here.

01:34:43.033 --> 01:34:44.168
Hey, Schipp.

01:34:44.835 --> 01:34:45.869
What?

01:35:01.852 --> 01:35:03.187
Son of a bitch.

01:35:22.172 --> 01:35:23.140
<i>I need all available units</i>

01:35:23.173 --> 01:35:24.375
<i>at the Crawford Airport,</i>

01:35:24.408 --> 01:35:25.577
<i>shoot to kill.</i>

01:35:38.522 --> 01:35:39.557
There it is.

01:35:40.057 --> 01:35:42.092
Uh-oh. Here comes
the cavalry.

01:35:42.126 --> 01:35:43.527
Shit.

01:35:43.561 --> 01:35:44.928
No, we can do this.
We can do it.

01:35:44.962 --> 01:35:45.996
Stop.

01:35:48.465 --> 01:35:49.967
- We can make it.
- Stop, stop.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.035
- We can make it.
- Stop!

01:35:51.068 --> 01:35:52.102
Stop? I'm not gonna stop!

01:35:56.407 --> 01:35:57.207
What the...?

01:36:01.945 --> 01:36:02.580
<i>How's Jeremy?</i>

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:04.848
<i>He's, uh, he's 20.</i>

01:36:06.417 --> 01:36:07.284
He's not coming out of this.

01:36:09.987 --> 01:36:11.121
Make the right decision.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:26.036
What are you doing? What are
you doing? We can't stop.

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:27.871
- We gotta go.
- They make it to that plane,

01:36:27.905 --> 01:36:29.306
- we're all dead.
- Whatever y'all do,

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:31.141
- do it fast.
- What are you doing?

01:36:31.175 --> 01:36:32.476
Let it go, Conner. I gotta go.

01:36:32.509 --> 01:36:34.345
That's not how we roll,
Captain, you know that.

01:36:34.378 --> 01:36:35.879
it's my fucking three seconds,
my call.

01:36:35.913 --> 01:36:37.281
That's a direct order.
Get out of the car.

01:36:52.096 --> 01:36:53.497
Password for the pilot
is Jeremy.

01:36:55.499 --> 01:36:56.500
He's paid.

01:37:01.004 --> 01:37:02.239
Let's go,
come on, look!

01:37:04.007 --> 01:37:05.275
Come on!

01:38:09.239 --> 01:38:10.274
Candace!

01:38:12.142 --> 01:38:13.310
Candace!

01:38:16.313 --> 01:38:18.982
- Where's everybody else?
- We gotta go, babe.

01:38:19.316 --> 01:38:21.351
Mason sent us,
password Jeremy.

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.387
Where we going?

01:38:46.343 --> 01:38:47.478
Fire!

01:39:45.369 --> 01:39:47.437
You shouldn't have
fucked with me.

01:40:06.256 --> 01:40:08.325
<i>This has been
one of the deadliest days</i>

01:40:08.358 --> 01:40:09.661
<i>that the city has seen.</i>

01:40:09.694 --> 01:40:12.229
Several police officers
have been killed,

01:40:12.262 --> 01:40:14.866
the infamous and
untouchable Tyrone Pettis

01:40:14.899 --> 01:40:16.568
and his security are no more.

01:40:17.167 --> 01:40:21.471
Former Captain Brice Mason is
one of the outlaws responsible

01:40:21.505 --> 01:40:23.340
and he has been killed.

01:40:23.373 --> 01:40:25.810
Thank you Sylvia.
What a shocking story.

01:40:25.843 --> 01:40:28.145
We'll update you when
we get more information.

01:40:35.787 --> 01:40:38.422
Aw, he loves her daddy, Millie.

01:40:38.455 --> 01:40:39.757
Come here you want your daddy?

01:41:03.615 --> 01:41:04.481
<i>Hey, Schipp.</i>

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:32.309
Sorry, Alston.

01:41:45.623 --> 01:41:47.959
Hi, I'm with the Grandview
trust fund.

01:41:47.992 --> 01:41:50.762
We're all set up to
send funds to the victims

01:41:50.795 --> 01:41:53.330
of the Brownsville Road
standoff.

01:41:53.898 --> 01:41:56.801
No, no ma'am, I don't need you
to send me any money.

01:41:58.803 --> 01:42:00.537
No, no, Western Union.

01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:06.811
I can't say who set it up,
they wish to remain...

01:42:08.913 --> 01:42:09.847
confidential.
