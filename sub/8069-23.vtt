WEBVTT

00:05.373 --> 00:07.775
[theme music]

00:53.287 --> 00:54.288
DAN: Becky, wrap it up.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.523
One sec!

00:55.556 --> 00:56.624
Try Jerry Paulson.

00:59.593 --> 01:05.032
555-4131.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.267
Yeah, I gotta go.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.401
It's the 'rents.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.302
Bye.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.337
Thank you.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.376
What's wrong?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.910
I can believe that what was
gonna be a really great party

01:16.944 --> 01:19.380
tomorrow night is turning into
the snooze of the century.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.314
Why?

01:20.348 --> 01:21.615
What did they do,
invite your dad?

01:21.649 --> 01:24.017
No, first Wayne
Frankel isn't coming.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.120
And now Richie Barr can't come,
because his parents are making

01:26.154 --> 01:29.157
him go to some stupid funeral.

01:29.190 --> 01:33.127
Well, maybe somebody
in their family died.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.094
Yeah, but you're right.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.364
A party is a party.

01:36.397 --> 01:40.534
Darlene, How would you like
to make a little money Saturday,

01:40.568 --> 01:41.935
helping me on a drywall job?

01:41.969 --> 01:43.304
That kid Walt flaked out on me.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.205
How much?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.139
Never mind how much.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.607
Yes or no?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.508
10 bucks-- yes.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.609
8 bucks-- no.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.811
10 bucks, but
we start at 6:00.

01:50.844 --> 01:51.845
Breakfast at the diner?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.314
Diner it is.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.815
Can I finish the dishes later?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.984
I think this needs a soak.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.819
Yeah, I'll do it later.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.588
Dad, how about a little
roundball under the lights?

02:00.621 --> 02:03.056
Sure.

02:03.090 --> 02:03.957
Dan?

02:03.991 --> 02:05.193
Honey, I'll be
out in a minute.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.827
What?

02:06.860 --> 02:08.662
Well, that wasn't very nice.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.563
What?

02:09.597 --> 02:11.365
- What you just did.
- What?

02:11.399 --> 02:12.333
What, you don't even know?

02:12.366 --> 02:13.467
What?

02:13.501 --> 02:16.670
Well, you got
two daughters, Dan.

02:16.704 --> 02:20.174
You know, maybe Becky wants
to make some money too.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.210
Becky measuring drywall?

02:22.243 --> 02:23.110
That is for to laugh!

02:26.480 --> 02:29.350
No, that is not for to laugh.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.051
I mean, you just
asked Darlene to go,

02:31.084 --> 02:33.754
and then-- and then you just
assumed Becky doesn't wanna go.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.955
That reminds me
of my dad when he

02:34.988 --> 02:36.890
used to ask Jackie to
go fishing and just

02:36.924 --> 02:38.158
assume I didn't wanna go.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.093
Roseanne, you
don't like fishing.

02:40.127 --> 02:42.563
I like it better
than rejection.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.864
I didn't reject anybody.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.633
Becky doesn't like
hammers and saws.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.767
How do you know?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.369
Because I tried to saw
her in half one time,

02:48.402 --> 02:51.405
and she started screaming.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.740
What is this all about?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.643
It's about your daughter,
who's upstairs feeling unloved,

02:55.676 --> 02:57.411
unwanted, and alone.

02:57.445 --> 03:00.147
And she ain't even married.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.449
You are completely
out of your mind.

03:01.482 --> 03:04.618
Don't try to change subject.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.654
She's probably up there right
now, crying her eyes out.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.655
Oh golly, Katie.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.723
Bar the damn door.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.292
Roseanne, forget about it.
I'm not going up there.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.493
This is bull.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.728
Whatever you're thinking,
put it out of your mind.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.163
Fine, Dan.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.130
Just do whatever you want.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.704
[mumbling]

03:25.273 --> 03:27.975
(SINGING): And pump it up,
while your feet are stomping.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.377
And the jam is pumpin'.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.312
Look at the party jumpin'.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.414
Pump it up a little more.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.915
Get the party going
On the dance floor.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.251
See, 'cause that's
where the party's at--

03:40.254 --> 03:43.123
I want a place to stay.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.525
Get into the mood--

03:48.962 --> 03:49.930
Hi.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.499
What?

03:51.532 --> 03:55.403
Can I come in, or do I
gotta get my hand stamped?

03:55.436 --> 03:57.971
Pump up the jam?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.206
How long were
you standing there?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.040
Just one verse.

04:03.777 --> 04:04.945
So what do you want?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.614
Oh, I wanted to know if
you wanted to help me out

04:06.647 --> 04:08.616
on that drywall job Saturday.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.183
I thought you got
Darlene to do it.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.185
Yeah, but I thought maybe
you'd like to join the fun.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.153
What fun?

04:13.186 --> 04:14.755
Standing around
some guy's basement?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.156
Well, it's a half-day's work.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.025
I thought you could
use the extra cash.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.261
Is this cinch coming loose?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.864
You're just up here
to spy, aren't you?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.434
No, that's pretty much
your mom's department.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.168
Hey, I know how
you and mom work.

04:28.201 --> 04:31.405
You get me out of the house so
mom can come in here and clean.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.775
Hey, Becky, why do you
assume there's some ulterior

04:34.808 --> 04:35.976
motive for me coming up here?

04:36.009 --> 04:38.111
Because you only come
up here for two reasons--

04:38.145 --> 04:40.948
to say good night and
to fix the toilet.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.650
And now it's only 7:00 PM.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.388
Toilet's working fine.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.360
So what's going on?

04:52.393 --> 04:55.028
What's going on with you?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.864
This is about the
dishes, isn't it?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.131
No, it's not about the dishes.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.367
It's not about anything, Becky.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.102
What's with the attitude?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.804
I just came up here to
ask you a simple question.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.105
Do you want the job?
Yes or no?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.040
Well, if I say no, can I go
to the party tomorrow night?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.809
Hey, you can do
anything you wanna do.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.243
This is not a trick question.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.680
I thought it might be fun
to spend some time together.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.382
All right, if you're
gonna make me go, I'll go.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.316
Hey, I don't want you to do
anything you don't wanna do.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.085
If you wanna come
along, come along.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.086
If you don't want to, fine!

05:19.119 --> 05:19.987
Fine!

05:20.020 --> 05:20.821
Fine!

05:24.892 --> 05:25.726
Was that about the dishes?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.281
Well, was I right?

05:48.315 --> 05:49.116
Yeah, you were right.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.220
You know, I didn't
wanna be right.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.354
I was hoping I was wrong.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.491
Well, you weren't.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.659
What happened?

05:58.692 --> 06:01.028
I don't know.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.530
I went up there to ask
her a question, then

06:02.563 --> 06:06.166
the next thing I know, we
were shouting at each other.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.635
What were you shouting about?

06:07.668 --> 06:08.469
I don't even know.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.044
You know, I love this old porch.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.846
It's like being on
the back of a caboose

06:18.879 --> 06:21.415
that's not going anywhere.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.116
Well, you may not
be going no place,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.385
but I'm going in, 'cause
I'm freezing my butt off.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.861
You just need to spend
more time with her, Dan.

06:33.894 --> 06:38.766
You know, get
interested in her life.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.267
What am I supposed
to do, baby?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.135
Hang out at the malt shop?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.203
Maybe.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.372
Hey, if you do, bring
me back something.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.247
Hey, Deej.
your fly's open.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.883
Huh?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.519
Dad, 7:00 tonight, don't
forget, Blackhawks, Oilers.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.587
I'll be there.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.588
The beverages will be there.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.256
The chips will be there.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.593
But-- but Becky,
you won't be here,

07:05.626 --> 07:07.528
because you go to that party.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.996
That's right.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.498
Too bad.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.665
Like I care.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.534
So who's throwing the shindig?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.936
Shindig?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.505
Yeah, it's a word
from the olden days.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.308
It's at Joyce's house.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.209
Oh, Joyce.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.344
Yeah, she's a nice girl.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.713
You never met her.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.681
Well, yeah, but throwing
a party and all, that's

07:27.715 --> 07:30.017
a pretty nice thing to do.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.685
Um, so Becky, you
think her parents

07:31.719 --> 07:34.187
are gonna spring for a live
band like Billy Walt's parents

07:34.221 --> 07:35.288
did last year?

07:35.322 --> 07:38.025
Remember that Dan, and
the cops showed up?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.459
Boy, I bet that was rad.

07:49.002 --> 07:53.206
So Becky, who you
taking to this shindig?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.241
Nobody special.

07:54.274 --> 07:58.045
What about Jerry
Mellon Spellon Miss?

07:58.078 --> 07:58.946
Meltrigger?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.114
Yeah, Jimmy Meltrigger.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.015
I like him.

08:05.085 --> 08:09.322
Well, you know, there was
things about him I liked.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.493
I didn't love the guy.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.098
Becky did, till he dumped her.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.199
He didn't dump me.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.100
Get real.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.168
You hit the ground like a safe.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.374
He dumped you?

08:27.407 --> 08:28.275
He didn't dump me, dad!

08:28.308 --> 08:29.977
I mean, you broke up with him?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.078
Why are you being so nosy?

08:31.111 --> 08:31.979
I'm not being nosy.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.446
I-- I just wanna know.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.816
You wanna know?

08:35.849 --> 08:39.687
He used me to get to know Susan
Noonan, and then he dumped me.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.488
And now he's going
out with her, OK?

08:41.521 --> 08:42.790
And now you know everything!

08:42.823 --> 08:43.924
And I'm gonna be in my
room, in case you wanna come

08:43.957 --> 08:45.025
up and do a little more spying.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.062
Good.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.598
Roseanne, I can't tell
you how you've helped

08:50.631 --> 08:51.999
my relationship with Becky.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.238
Hey, dad, you ready
for me to slaughter you?

08:58.271 --> 08:59.573
Oh, so now it's your turn.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.513
Is there a big
storm brewing here?

09:06.546 --> 09:07.514
I mean, like, should I split?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.249
Because I gotta do some baking.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.752
No, it's just the
usual family tension.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.454
You know, this one ain't
talking to that one.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.756
That one ain't
talking to this one.

09:15.789 --> 09:16.757
What did you do?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.525
What do you mean,
what did I do?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.728
How come all the time
you think it's my fault?

09:20.761 --> 09:26.934
OK, like, assume it's not
your fault. So what happened?

09:26.967 --> 09:32.472
Well, it's all my fault.
Well, Dan goes over to Darlene,

09:32.505 --> 09:34.441
and he asked her if she wants
to make some extra money,

09:34.474 --> 09:35.643
you know?

09:35.676 --> 09:36.977
Well, Becky needs to make
some extra money too.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.311
Because she spends more money
on clothes, for one thing,

09:38.345 --> 09:39.246
than Darlene does.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.547
You know, I don't know.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.184
He just asked Darlene, and
he totally overlooked Becky.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.553
You know, Gary does
that stuff with his dogs.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.455
Like, he'll always
favor the collie.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.494
Uh-huh.

09:54.527 --> 09:55.796
Well, this is about me.

09:55.829 --> 09:56.697
Yeah, I know.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.597
Go ahead.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.032
So I get all over Dan.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.167
You know, I tell
him, hey, you got

10:00.200 --> 10:01.301
two daughters, and
the whole deal,

10:01.334 --> 10:02.469
and everything like
that, you know?

10:02.502 --> 10:04.471
So then he goes up, and
he asks Becky to go.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.506
And she of course says no.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.642
Because who wants to go any
place after your mom makes

10:08.676 --> 10:09.977
your dad ask you?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.846
You know, dogs can sense
when you're appeasing them too.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.953
Now, try to stay
with me here, sis.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.322
So anyways, then we're sitting
here at the breakfast table,

10:22.355 --> 10:23.891
and he's trying to talk
Becky and everything.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.726
He's getting all
palsy-walsy with her.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.860
All this crap.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.228
And he's just driving
her nuts, because he's

10:28.261 --> 10:30.430
asking her question, after
question, after question.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.699
She just finally goes crazy.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.266
Now she ain't talking to him.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.736
He blames me, so he
ain't talking to me.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.707
Hm, nothing to do
this weekend, sis?

10:39.740 --> 10:42.209
No, I-- I just
don't want Dan pulling

10:42.242 --> 10:43.643
the same kind of
head trip on Becky

10:43.677 --> 10:45.979
like daddy used to pull on me.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.580
What head trip?

10:47.614 --> 10:49.149
You know, how he'd
always think of something

10:49.182 --> 10:51.719
really fun to do, and then he'd
only ask you to go with him.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.986
He did not!

10:53.020 --> 10:53.854
He did too!

10:53.887 --> 10:54.855
He did not.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.156
I was the only one home.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.557
That's why.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.459
Anyway, you were the only one
who could bear to be with mom.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.863
Jackie, you know
you're daddy's favorite.

11:02.896 --> 11:03.997
I am not.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.634
Beer break.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.535
Pee break.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.704
That's how it works.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.273
How do you think
I feel, Jackie?

11:13.306 --> 11:14.241
He calls you every Sunday.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.642
How do you think
that makes me feel?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.410
How does it make you
feel, knowing mom

11:17.444 --> 11:19.980
calls me all the time
and she never calls you?

11:20.013 --> 11:26.086
Lucky, Honored, off the
hook, free, thrilled, elated!

11:26.119 --> 11:27.620
Glad that she's
still alive, but I

11:27.654 --> 11:29.923
don't have to talk to her,
glad that every time the phone

11:29.957 --> 11:31.458
rings I know it can't be her!

11:31.491 --> 11:32.793
Oh, all right, all right!

11:32.826 --> 11:34.127
Amazing.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.663
200 miles away, and your parents
can still ruin a weekend.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.801
Roseanne, Dan and Becky have a
perfectly healthy relationship.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.069
Not anymore.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.536
Dan spends just as
much time with Becky

11:43.570 --> 11:47.207
as you do with Darlene.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.742
Yeah.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.043
Yeah, what?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.545
Yeah, you have just a crummy
relationship with Darlene

11:52.579 --> 11:53.947
as I have with Becky.

11:53.981 --> 11:54.848
Are you kidding me?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.149
Are you kidding me?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.886
You didn't even know she's
broke up with her boyfriend?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.520
What was the score at
Darlene's basketball game

12:00.553 --> 12:01.354
Tuesday night?

12:05.492 --> 12:08.228
21.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.362
I don't know.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.131
How much money did she
lose on the Super Bowl?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.265
What, she's gambling?

12:12.299 --> 12:13.733
Buck and 1/2,
plus a praying man

12:13.767 --> 12:14.768
she found at the Lanford Club.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.003
What's she doing
at the Lanford Club?

12:16.036 --> 12:17.304
You don't know?

12:17.337 --> 12:19.873
I hope she wasn't devastated
by your lack of interest.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.976
Hey, me and Darlene have
a perfect relationship.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.012
Yeah, you trade wise cracks.

12:25.045 --> 12:29.316
Kind of the same way that
mom and I trade put-downs.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.019
I am not like mom.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.788
Me and Darlene do a lot more
than just trading wisecracks,

12:34.822 --> 12:35.688
I will have you know.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.691
We love spending time together.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.728
Darlene, honey.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.632
You wanna take a walk with me
down to the store later on?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.734
Gee, I'd love to, mom, but
I'd rather stay home and drill

12:47.767 --> 12:48.902
some screws into my toes.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.286
You gotta love
her sense of humor.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.594
Where you going?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.662
Watch the game.

13:15.695 --> 13:16.930
On TV?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.698
No, the Bulls and the Knicks
are actually coming over

13:18.731 --> 13:20.834
and playing in our living room.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.302
You wanna help me
move the couch?

13:22.335 --> 13:23.703
Yeah, we'll put
it in your mouth.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.242
What are you doing?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.944
Well, I'm joining you.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.313
Yeah, but you hate basketball.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.683
Yeah, I know that, but
I love my little daughter.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.955
Hey, you wanna watch
that Mary Hart special?

13:47.027 --> 13:47.895
7, mom.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.728
All right.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.540
Hey, hey.

14:03.610 --> 14:09.049
Me and you, we have some
good talks, don't we?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.483
Mom, what's going on?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.819
I mean, why is dad at the
mall, leeching on Becky?

14:15.422 --> 14:18.225
Nothing's going on.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.126
You're lying.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.861
I'm not lying.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.797
Well, how come you're not at
the mall shopping with Becky?

14:24.831 --> 14:26.599
Well, I was gonna
go, but you know,

14:26.633 --> 14:29.369
I hear there's
some great game on.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.340
OK.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.641
I don't know.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.709
Well, me and your dad, we're
just checking in with you

14:36.743 --> 14:38.445
and Becky, you know?

14:38.478 --> 14:40.647
Parents just have to do
that every now and then.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.482
You just kind of--

14:42.515 --> 14:44.952
you know, you knock
on the door, and you

14:44.985 --> 14:49.322
just have to shut down there,
"hey, everything OK in there?"

14:49.356 --> 14:51.992
And you hope for a good answer.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.361
Is everything OK?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.063
Yeah.
Now shut the door.

14:56.096 --> 14:56.896
I'm getting a draft.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.936
Is that how you're going to
get through your life, just

15:02.970 --> 15:04.304
all these wisecracks?

15:04.337 --> 15:05.738
Is that what you're gonna do?

15:05.772 --> 15:08.608
Well, it worked for you.

15:08.641 --> 15:12.412
I mean, not that my wisecracks
can even compare with yours.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.646
Different leagues, you know?

15:13.680 --> 15:17.317
But I mean, it's
cool you're always

15:17.350 --> 15:19.919
coming up with this off-the-wall
stuff, and I like it.

15:19.953 --> 15:23.156
I mean, you're not as sappy as
all those other kids' parents.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.158
- Think so?
- Yeah, right.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.503
Listen, you hate
this, don't you?

15:36.536 --> 15:37.337
Of course not.

15:44.744 --> 15:45.612
Be honest.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.813
I know you hate shopping.

15:46.846 --> 15:53.120
Only parts of it, like
the waiting, the walking,

15:53.153 --> 15:56.823
the searching, the carrying,
standing there like a fool

15:56.856 --> 16:00.393
while someone takes an
alarm off your new pants.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.728
Then why'd you come
down here with me?

16:01.761 --> 16:03.496
You could have just
dropped me off.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.565
Why do you feel like you
had to hang with me all day?

16:08.835 --> 16:09.702
Mom.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.071
Mom.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.605
Yeah, you know how she wants
everything to be just right.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.973
Uh-huh.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.642
She got it into her head
that you and I weren't

16:15.675 --> 16:18.378
spending enough time together.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.915
So here we are on a spree!

16:22.949 --> 16:25.252
Dad, we see each
other all the time.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.920
I mean, you were even up in
my room a couple days ago.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.557
Yeah, and you acted like it
was a crime against nature.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.027
Well, that's
'cause, you know, you

16:34.061 --> 16:36.963
don't usually come up there.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.665
Yeah, I-- I know.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.067
I don't know.

16:40.100 --> 16:45.105
I mean, I guess we really don't
talk a whole lot about what's

16:45.138 --> 16:46.973
going on in your life anymore.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.109
But I tell mom
stuff, and she pretty

16:49.142 --> 16:51.811
much tells you everything, huh?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.346
Not always.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.749
You know, you can
talk to me too.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.719
I'm crazy about you.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.889
I mean, I'm crazy about
your brother and sister too,

17:02.922 --> 17:05.558
but I really adore you.

17:05.592 --> 17:06.993
Dad.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.628
I know, I know.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.364
I'm just saying
maybe, you know--

17:11.398 --> 17:12.265
Yo, Connor.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.301
Yo, Dana, what's the haps?

17:14.334 --> 17:18.004
Oh, we're like in the
middle of the ultimate.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.340
Who are you here with?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.775
My old man.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.246
Hiya, kids!

17:26.279 --> 17:28.248
[coughing]

17:28.281 --> 17:31.718
Oh, hi, Mr. Connor.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.553
So where are you guys going?

17:33.586 --> 17:34.921
Oh, we're gonna go
check out some tapes

17:34.954 --> 17:37.724
at the Music Meister.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.827
Are you trapped
for the whole day?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.462
Well, sort of.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.330
All right.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.365
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.866
- OK.
- Maybe I'll call you tonight.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.268
- Sure.
- Dana, wait up.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.769
OK, OK, I won't call!

17:49.802 --> 17:51.003
Just hold on.

17:51.037 --> 17:55.742
Look, why don't we let each
other off the hook here?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.345
You go and shop, and I'll split.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.646
And we won't tell mom.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.880
Dad, that's lying.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.887
OK.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.924
Here, buy yourself
something nice.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.161
And when I get home, I
wanna hear all the gossip.

18:22.001 --> 18:22.869
Hey, dad.

18:22.902 --> 18:23.770
Yeah?

18:23.803 --> 18:25.004
Thanks for, you know?

18:29.609 --> 18:31.378
I love you.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.546
Yeah, I know.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.714
And here's a 10
spot for saying so.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.462
No, they don't make rubber.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.464
They get it from trees.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.833
And I already told you
how they get trees.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.734
Wow, mom.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.236
You really do know everything.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.506
Yeah, and I get
it all from books.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.342
Dad, did you know
mom knows everything?

19:02.375 --> 19:03.810
Yeah, that's just one
of the little things

19:03.843 --> 19:04.977
we have to live
with in this family.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.881
Hey, DJ.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.550
You know how they invented
privacy, don't you?

19:10.583 --> 19:11.451
How?

19:11.484 --> 19:12.285
Scram!

19:16.088 --> 19:17.724
So how'd it go?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.326
What can I say?

19:19.359 --> 19:22.695
I love the mall!

19:22.729 --> 19:24.564
Well, you missed a hell
of a Knicks game, boy.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.333
They had about 6
billion overtimes.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.234
No kidding?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.067
Who won?

19:34.241 --> 19:36.209
So you and Becky OK?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.109
Oh yeah.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.411
We had a great time.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.312
She looked at clothes.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.680
I watched.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.648
She looked at boys.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.549
I watched.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.616
She bumped into her friends.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.451
I split.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.488
She's OK.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.057
She loves me, and I love her.

19:51.090 --> 19:51.958
What can I say?

19:51.991 --> 19:54.527
I'm a model dad.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.363
Boy, I feel like I
had to go over there

19:56.396 --> 20:00.533
to the department store and pick
you up one of them dad jackets.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.469
You know, with the patches
on the elbows and everything.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.303
Ward.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.474
How'd you make
out with Darlene?

20:07.507 --> 20:10.843
You know, the daughter
I really like?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.079
Ah, we're fine.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.748
I don't know where you
came up with that one?

20:15.782 --> 20:18.551
As you'll recall,
I didn't start this.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.452
Oh, yeah.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.287
Well, whatever.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.167
Hi, dad.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.804
How's it going?

20:37.837 --> 20:40.106
Yeah.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.074
No kidding.

20:42.108 --> 20:42.909
Yeah.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.649
Yeah.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.783
That's really interesting, dad.

20:50.817 --> 20:51.618
Is mom there?

20:54.854 --> 20:57.089
Is that what you
mean by little things

20:57.123 --> 20:59.225
parents are nagging about?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.393
Yes.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.094
If they want us
to act like adults,

21:02.128 --> 21:04.631
why do they still treat
us as if we were children?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.165
Maybe we should talk to them.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.667
Every time they nag
us, we should tell them

21:07.700 --> 21:09.135
we are not children anymore.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.537
Talking won't help.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.005
But maybe if Johnny would do
what his mother wants him to do

21:13.039 --> 21:16.108
and wears rubbers when it's
raining or muddy outside.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.578
But gee, we can't
always be perfect.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.179
Sometimes, I just
don't feel like eating

21:20.212 --> 21:21.948
hot cereal for breakfast.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.049
We sure can't.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.017
We can't always do what
they tell us to do.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.186
Well, that's true,
but being an adult

21:27.219 --> 21:29.456
doesn't mean being
perfect either.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.191
Being an adult does mean
thinking out reasons

21:32.224 --> 21:35.428
for and against
eating certain foods,

21:35.462 --> 21:40.099
wearing rubbers,
sitting like a ramrod.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.670
Once you learn that what
your parents ask you to do

21:43.703 --> 21:47.974
is for your own good,
you'll be able to accept it.
