00:54.179 --> 00:57.516
<i>I don't know what to do
I'm always in the dark</i>

01:05.983 --> 01:09.403
<i>Forever's gonna start tonight</i>

01:09.403 --> 01:11.738
<i>Forever's gonna start to--</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:14.950
<i>Once upon a time
I was falling in love</i>

01:15.450 --> 01:17.953
<i>Now I'm only falling apart</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:22.541
<i>There's nothing I can do</i>

01:22.541 --> 01:27.045
<i>A total eclipse of the heart</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:29.882
<i>Okay. That was
a dedication from George to Angela</i>

01:29.882 --> 01:32.634
<i>after their negative result yesterday.</i>

01:32.634 --> 01:36.180
<i>I'm really sorry, guys. But
you know that you are not the only ones.</i>

01:36.180 --> 01:40.017
<i>And next, we're going to a dedication
from Emma to Craig.</i>

01:40.017 --> 01:46.732
<i>And we're gonna hear from the Only Ones
the song "Why Don't You Kill Yourself?"</i>

01:46.732 --> 01:47.983
<i>Okay.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:56.909
I was sorry to hear about
St. Leonard's closing down last month.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.785
- It was such a good school.
- Yeah.

01:58.785 --> 02:02.080
Yeah, it was unexpected.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.709
So you've worked mainly
in the third grade.

02:05.709 --> 02:09.170
Yeah. Plus a year in the fifth
and a couple in the fourth.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.850
Can I help?

02:24.853 --> 02:27.648
Okay. Could you write "versatile"?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.653
Versatile.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.324
How'd it go?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.704
Sorry. That's really personal.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.707
No. It's okay.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.628
It didn't go so well actually,
but it's fine.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.338
I'm used to it by now.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.634
What about you? Have you tested?

02:56.134 --> 03:00.013
Yeah. My boyfriend and I are positive.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.432
You're one of the lucky ones.

03:14.820 --> 03:19.032
"And she looked at the tree
and said, 'Wow.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.537
Those apples look so tasty.'

03:24.454 --> 03:27.165
And he looked at her,
and he said, 'Yeah, they do.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.959
We should eat one together.'

03:29.626 --> 03:32.129
So they picked the apple off the tree,

03:32.713 --> 03:36.550
split it and shared it while gazing
into each other's eyes."

03:37.176 --> 03:38.510
And then this is word for word,

03:38.510 --> 03:41.054
"It was peaceful in paradise,

03:41.680 --> 03:44.516
for there were no animals around
to disturb them

03:45.309 --> 03:46.810
or their love for each other."

03:47.603 --> 03:49.021
That's what the poster says?

03:49.021 --> 03:51.273
Yeah. It was at the principal's office.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.233
Can you imagine
what they're teaching these kids?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.985
I think that's gone too far.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.447
I don't think they should
change a story that old.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.451
Why? Did it even really happen?

04:05.037 --> 04:06.288
I'll get it.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.507
Hello?

04:17.298 --> 04:18.675
Yes, this is she.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.636
Yes.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.347
I came by and left my CV a few times.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.642
At the Love Institute?

04:27.518 --> 04:28.519
Great.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.689
At noon? Great.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.901
Okay. Have a nice evening.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.155
- Another interview?
- Yeah.

04:40.155 --> 04:41.657
That's great. Where is it?

04:42.741 --> 04:44.284
Pinewood Elementary School.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.371
Is that good?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.122
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

04:49.122 --> 04:54.294
Yeah. Yeah, they have, like--
a lot of famous people studied there.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.964
Really? Like who?

04:59.758 --> 05:01.009
Ginger Spice.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.303
- Wow.
- Yeah.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.181
She's my favorite.

05:06.849 --> 05:07.850
I know.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.396
Andy here is a great cook.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.941
Thank you. Yeah, it's a Spanish recipe.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.653
We've been trying to save up
for a vacation,

05:19.653 --> 05:21.446
and we were thinking of going to Spain.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.826
Carrie's been there once.
It was before she met me.

05:26.618 --> 05:31.832
Yeah, I went to Madrid
with one of my exes,

05:32.583 --> 05:33.834
a thousand years ago.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.714
How did you guys meet?

05:38.714 --> 05:40.632
It was at a friend's wedding.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.093
We were both sitting at the singles table.

05:43.093 --> 05:49.349
It was us, an 80-year-old fireman
and a nerdy biology student.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.934
So, tough choice.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.062
And how long have you been together?

05:54.855 --> 05:58.108
- It's been 94 days.
- Three months.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.276
Nice.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.737
And have you thought
about taking the test?

06:05.908 --> 06:08.410
I mean, you know my opinion.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.495
We don't believe in it.

06:11.121 --> 06:15.250
The whole crisis overreaction thing,
it's pretty stupid.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.614
- Really good.
- Yeah, great.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.327
We could take some dance classes.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.538
Yeah.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.959
I gotta use the restroom.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.300
Can I ask you something?

07:06.718 --> 07:08.095
Have you guys taken the test?

07:08.720 --> 07:09.847
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.976
Yeah, it was about three years ago.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.060
We were positive.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.478
- Nice.
- Yeah.

07:16.478 --> 07:20.065
And how did it feel?
I mean, when you got your results.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.985
Yeah, I think more than anything it felt
kind of like a relief.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.029
You know, it was like
a weight had been lifted.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.032
You know,
Garth doesn't believe in taking the test.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.995
He says he doesn't need a certificate
to tell him if we're in love.

07:33.996 --> 07:36.290
And he also thinks
losing a nail is ridiculous.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.168
And you? What do you think?

07:39.877 --> 07:42.546
You know, more and more
of my friends have taken it,

07:42.546 --> 07:45.007
and I thought maybe we could too, but--

07:47.259 --> 07:50.721
You know, Anna wanted us to go and,
go to the institute

07:50.721 --> 07:53.140
just do the exercises,
you know, last summer,

07:53.140 --> 07:55.309
but I thought it was
completely unnecessary.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.896
You know, we had tested positive
without the extra help, and--

07:59.479 --> 08:03.483
and even if sometimes
our relationship settles into routine,

08:04.067 --> 08:05.611
we don't need to question that.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.222
- All right. This is for you.
- Great.

08:33.222 --> 08:35.307
Just fill this out,
and Duncan will be with you shortly.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.018
Thank you. Excuse me.
Can I ask, is it raining?

08:38.809 --> 08:42.188
No. No, they just pump that
through the entire building.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.191
Rain makes people feel romantic.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.903
Yeah, it does.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.823
I keep asking them to turn it down.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.992
It just makes me need to pee.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.842
<i>I often put his happiness before my own.</i>

09:09.842 --> 09:12.010
When we have rib eye for dinner,

09:12.636 --> 09:14.721
I know that he likes
the fatty bits of the steak.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.057
So that-- Well, I cut them off mine
and give them to him

09:17.057 --> 09:20.894
and pretend that I don't like them,
but actually I love them.

09:21.478 --> 09:22.855
They're my favorite part.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.899
And may I ask you something personal?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.443
Do you still have strong feelings for him?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.321
Yes. Yeah.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.741
Yeah, I love him.

09:36.577 --> 09:40.497
You do have your love certificate,
so that's not a problem, but--

09:40.497 --> 09:44.251
Well, most of our recent applicants
have all been in an institute as clients.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.546
So they know what it's like
to do these exercises as a couple.

09:47.546 --> 09:50.132
Yeah. Well, they weren't around yet, but--

09:50.799 --> 09:55.596
I really wanna learn how the exercises
help you connect more, you know?

09:55.596 --> 09:58.473
And you guys, you're the best.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.852
Well, it's not easy, but we try.

10:02.853 --> 10:07.566
Now, Anna, as a teacher,
I have to ask you,

10:08.192 --> 10:10.694
you wouldn't prefer to work in a school?

10:12.446 --> 10:15.365
No. I really want to work here.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.419
- Hey!
- Hey.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.506
Made you dinner to celebrate the new job.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.926
How do you know that?

10:34.843 --> 10:36.345
They called a couple hours ago.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.138
I said you were out,
so they left a message,

10:38.138 --> 10:42.184
and the school secretary wants
to talk to you tomorrow about the details.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.561
Fuck. I didn't realize
you were talking about

10:44.561 --> 10:46.230
the interview the day before yesterday,

10:46.230 --> 10:48.899
'cause today I went
to Pinewood Elementary School,

10:48.899 --> 10:50.484
and they hired me on the spot.

10:51.276 --> 10:53.153
That's great. Did you take it?

10:53.779 --> 10:55.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

10:55.822 --> 10:58.534
- Yeah.
- Great.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.163
- Congratulations. Come on.
- Thank you.

11:34.152 --> 11:38.991
Excuse me. This would not make Amir happy.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.621
I was just about to say

11:44.621 --> 11:48.584
that the reason they come to us is
to take the risk out of love.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.169
No more uncertainty.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.255
No more wondering
if you've chosen the right partner.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.424
No more divorce.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.051
Now, you know that five years ago,

11:58.051 --> 12:01.180
the test was developed
in order to define love relationships

12:01.180 --> 12:03.807
because there was concern
people weren't falling in love.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.059
However, what they couldn't
have anticipated was

12:06.059 --> 12:10.147
the fact that 87% of the couples
that took the test

12:10.147 --> 12:11.607
received a negative result.

12:11.607 --> 12:13.734
It was a staggering statistic.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.361
Couples broke apart.

12:17.196 --> 12:21.200
And people suffered a great deal.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.870
And you're all aware
of the crisis that followed,

12:24.870 --> 12:28.040
the insecurity that this created
in most couples.

12:28.624 --> 12:30.709
And that's why I founded this institute.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.504
We were the first to buy the machines
to conduct the test,

12:34.505 --> 12:38.592
and I created the program
to make the bond of love stronger.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.428
We're not here
to try to teach people to fall in love.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.971
That would be insane.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.183
We're here to try to bring them
closer together.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.145
Now, yes,
the success rate, it's still low.

12:50.145 --> 12:53.148
But thanks to this institute
and others who imitate us,

12:53.148 --> 12:54.816
the numbers are slowly increasing.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.986
At this point, the test,
it's more popular than ever.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.864
So that shows that
people are searching for an answer,

13:00.864 --> 13:03.408
even if
it's not the one they want to hear.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.661
Now, I hope that,
as new employees, you'll--

13:06.161 --> 13:07.663
- Sorry, I'm late.
- You'll--

13:07.663 --> 13:10.415
- That's okay. Hi.
- Hey.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.000
I--

13:13.418 --> 13:15.337
Anyhow, what I was gonna say was,

13:15.337 --> 13:20.759
in the past, I think we prioritized
seemingly more important things over love

13:20.759 --> 13:22.219
when the truth is...

13:25.013 --> 13:26.640
we're all achingly lonely.

13:28.225 --> 13:31.436
And we're endlessly searching
for ways to fill that void.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.524
Anyhow, each month, we change the courses

13:35.524 --> 13:38.235
so the couples, they don't know
the structure of the program.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.945
And Amir, one of our instructors,

13:39.945 --> 13:43.949
he's been kind enough to design
and build these maquettes

13:43.949 --> 13:46.994
to help illustrate
what's included in those materials,

13:46.994 --> 13:48.537
if you'd like to come take a look.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.340
The first one, it's--
well, it's kind of a domestic scene.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.385
You'll see that when one leaves,

14:04.469 --> 14:07.097
the other one may give themselves
a small electroshock

14:07.097 --> 14:09.683
with the equipment
we will have provided them with.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.977
The person must associate the two pains.

14:11.977 --> 14:14.062
The loss of one manifests itself in--

14:14.062 --> 14:16.940
in actual physical pain
for the one left behind.

14:17.649 --> 14:18.650
Do you understand?

14:19.610 --> 14:23.488
The second, it's kind
of a sporting scene designed by Amir.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.367
Couples engage in a series
of pair-based competitive activities

14:27.367 --> 14:29.828
in the hopes
that they'll be bonded together.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.747
And this is one we've just talked about

14:31.747 --> 14:33.916
but haven't yet
had the chance to implement.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.628
We want to create
a fake fire in a movie theater,

14:37.628 --> 14:39.046
where the clients are gathered.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.131
Now, they'd be unaware
that it's a simulation.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.468
Right now, what we do is
we have them watch romantic movies,

14:44.468 --> 14:48.096
but with the fire,
we'd really be able to--

14:48.096 --> 14:52.809
to gauge their reaction and see just how
protective they are of their other half.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.772
We've also recently acquired
the rights to a compilation--

14:57.272 --> 14:58.607
Alexandra?

14:58.607 --> 15:02.152
Compilation of classic love songs
in their French version

15:02.653 --> 15:04.655
to be used in our musical exercises.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.490
If you'd queue that up, please.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.689
Do you have any other questions?

15:40.274 --> 15:42.276
How often do people get 50%?

15:43.235 --> 15:46.488
Not a lot. Not a lot, but sometimes.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.408
And those are often the hardest cases

15:49.408 --> 15:51.869
when only one person is in love.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.453
Especially when the machine,

15:53.453 --> 15:56.915
it can't identify
which member of the couple is in love.

15:57.499 --> 16:03.213
You see, the results,
they can range anywhere from 100% to 0%.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.716
Do they ever come back to retest?

16:07.426 --> 16:08.510
Sometimes.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.307
But it really depends on them,
whether or when they will retest or not.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.685
And one more question I've been wondering.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.354
What do we do
if someone doesn't have arms?

16:22.691 --> 16:23.775
To be honest...

16:25.944 --> 16:27.446
well, I have no idea.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.088
Yeah.

16:47.508 --> 16:48.592
Hey.

16:50.969 --> 16:51.970
Sorry.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.517
- Hey.
- So, you'll be shadowing Amir.

16:56.517 --> 16:58.018
He's only been here for a few months,

16:58.018 --> 17:00.312
but he's already
one of our most successful instructors.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.522
Great.

17:04.775 --> 17:08.612
Here. We give this to all of our clients.

17:08.612 --> 17:12.281
This one explains the exercise
where they need to draw one another.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.160
Interesting. Can I ask you something?

17:15.661 --> 17:17.246
Why are the songs in French?

17:20.249 --> 17:25.127
<i>Il Français est
la linguage plus érotique, non?</i>

17:26.421 --> 17:27.256
<i>Oui.</i>

17:39.017 --> 17:39.852
Hi.

17:40.352 --> 17:41.603
Hi.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.272
- I'm Amir.
- Hi.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.065
I'm Anna.

17:45.566 --> 17:47.442
I'll be shadowing you this session.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.527
Cool.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.445
Just so you know, you're my first trainee,

17:50.445 --> 17:52.197
so I'll do my best.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.369
Great. Well, we're gonna be spending
our first week doing intake interviews.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.497
You know, new couples.
So, I'll get the files.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.707
Okay.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.213
Is that your partner?

18:10.090 --> 18:11.091
Natasha.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.803
- You guys look great together.
- Thank you.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.974
It's our two-year anniversary
in a couple of weeks.

18:19.766 --> 18:20.767
How did you meet?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.064
We met at a video store.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.151
We both wanted to rent
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.

18:29.902 --> 18:32.321
There was only one copy left,
so we watched it together.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.948
That's amazing.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.785
No, I'm joking. No, we just met normally.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.212
So you've been together for six months?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.172
- Yes.
- Yes.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.802
And you both work together
at the accounting office?

18:57.095 --> 18:58.013
- Yes.
- Yes.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.599
It's nice to have similar interests.

19:02.601 --> 19:03.602
Accounting.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.941
Okay. John, I'm gonna ask you first.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.901
What's the one thing you love most
about Maria

19:10.901 --> 19:14.071
that makes you certain
she is the ideal partner for you?

19:17.783 --> 19:19.493
That's the first question?

19:20.536 --> 19:22.162
I'm supposed to answer that now?

19:23.872 --> 19:27.042
Take your time. And reply from the heart.

19:28.252 --> 19:30.921
Sorry, is-- What is-- Is that--

19:30.921 --> 19:32.673
Isn't it a little bit early
for that question?

19:32.673 --> 19:34.508
- No, that's a--
- Well, it's just 'cause--

19:34.508 --> 19:37.970
I love her hair. It's soft.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.682
And her...

19:45.686 --> 19:46.687
voice.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.147
Yes, her voice even more.

19:50.107 --> 19:51.441
It soothes me.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.281
- That's a nice answer.
- It's nice.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.285
Rob is also a great dancer...

20:03.370 --> 20:06.164
but he never dances with me at parties.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.668
He feels embarrassed
in front of other people.

20:10.794 --> 20:16.550
But it's fun, 'cause at home he puts on
music and dances alone for hours.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.635
And you, Rob?

20:18.635 --> 20:19.970
I think I'm a good dancer.

20:19.970 --> 20:20.929
No, h--

20:21.430 --> 20:23.348
How does Sally make you feel?

20:25.184 --> 20:27.561
Well, when we're together,

20:28.645 --> 20:32.941
I feel as if I'm... invisible.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.071
So what do you mean by that?

20:38.655 --> 20:42.784
I feel like, normally,
people are always looking at me,

20:42.784 --> 20:45.787
and I'm always aware of that feeling.

20:46.538 --> 20:50.083
Outside. Apart. But I--

20:51.293 --> 20:53.170
I don't have that when I'm with her.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.340
I just blend into her.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.264
Okay.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.851
I think that's good for today.

21:23.617 --> 21:25.452
Do you think they're lonely together?

21:29.414 --> 21:31.708
I don't know. Or-- Maybe.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.420
I know you can't really tell
from one image,

21:35.420 --> 21:37.256
but I don't know,
there's just something really--

21:37.256 --> 21:39.424
Should we order drinks while we wait?

21:39.424 --> 21:41.385
<i>Oui. D'accord, mon amour.</i>

21:42.386 --> 21:43.387
What?

21:44.221 --> 21:45.222
Nothing.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.351
"Spaghetti carbonara." Yum.

21:49.852 --> 21:53.146
Actually, I wanna have
the "rib eye with caramelized onions."

21:53.146 --> 21:54.356
Yes.

21:54.356 --> 21:57.860
Are you sure? You always only eat half.
Why don't you go ahead and get the--

21:57.860 --> 21:59.987
- Sorry for being late.
- Hey.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.488
Hi.

22:10.622 --> 22:11.707
What's that?

22:12.416 --> 22:16.253
Andy-- We took the test again.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.172
I need a drink.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.467
Hey.

22:23.093 --> 22:26.221
Could I have just a glass of red wine?

22:26.847 --> 22:29.683
- Just make it three glasses, please.
- We'll make it a bottle.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.230
It was positive.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.857
Fuck you.

22:37.608 --> 22:38.984
That's not funny.

22:40.194 --> 22:42.946
- That's great. Great.
- Yeah.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.406
Yeah, yeah. Congratulations.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.699
Thank you.

22:48.452 --> 22:52.331
Why did you guys
take the test again though?

22:52.331 --> 22:54.708
We've been having some arguments,

22:54.708 --> 22:57.544
and Andy thought it would be
a good idea to know again.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.714
Even if I told him
there would be a lot of risk.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.966
But I hope there's no need to do it again.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.846
I really don't get it.

23:08.764 --> 23:11.892
So many couples would kill
to have a positive result.

23:12.434 --> 23:13.560
Why would they risk it?

23:17.940 --> 23:18.941
What's that?

23:20.359 --> 23:21.485
Probably nothing.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.948
No. No, we should get it booked
for a service.

23:34.414 --> 23:37.292
<i>With you I'm in real danger.</i>

23:37.793 --> 23:43.298
<i>It seems like a perfect situation,
apart from that foul temper of yours,</i>

23:43.298 --> 23:50.222
<i>but my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not recover,</i>

23:50.222 --> 23:57.020
<i>if I was, once again, cast aside
as I would absolutely expect to be.</i>

23:57.020 --> 23:59.940
<i>There are just too many
pictures of you, too many...</i>

24:01.567 --> 24:03.777
<i>You know, you'd go and I'd be--</i>

24:04.903 --> 24:06.989
- <i>well, buggered, basically.</i>
- Wait.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.285
<i>That really is a real no, isn't it?</i>

24:12.452 --> 24:15.956
<i>I live in Notting Hill.
You live in Beverly Hills.</i>

24:16.915 --> 24:21.211
<i>Everyone in the world knows who you are.
My mother has trouble remembering my name.</i>

24:23.505 --> 24:24.339
<i>Fine.</i>

24:37.811 --> 24:40.355
The fire was such a good idea.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.649
Yeah, the cinema owner got cold feet.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.235
It wasn't even that dangerous.
I mean, what's the worst that can happen?

24:45.235 --> 24:46.987
We've always had movies in the program.

24:46.987 --> 24:49.323
Duncan thinks it's crucial.
I just don't see it.

24:49.323 --> 24:50.908
Everything's too simple in films.

24:50.908 --> 24:53.285
Besides, watching a love story feels safe.

24:53.285 --> 24:54.703
Being in love doesn't.

24:56.747 --> 25:00.417
No, I prefer doing exercises
based on the movies, you know?

25:01.210 --> 25:02.461
Like <i>Titanic</i>?

25:05.297 --> 25:06.798
Do you like romantic movies?

25:08.258 --> 25:10.052
Nah, I like horrors.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.934
That's all right.
Yeah. Don't worry if you're tired.

25:16.934 --> 25:19.937
Can watch a movie at home. Okay.

25:19.937 --> 25:23.023
I'll see you later. Bye. Love you, bye.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.369
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

25:35.369 --> 25:36.328
Are you leaving?

25:36.912 --> 25:38.997
I'm just going. Sorry.

25:39.623 --> 25:40.749
- Oh, Anna?
- Yeah?

25:41.667 --> 25:43.126
Y-- Really great job this week.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.587
Thank you.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.673
- Okay.
- Bye.

25:47.673 --> 25:48.757
Bye.

25:55.264 --> 26:00.185
<i>Each year, caribou undertake
a long and perilous journey,</i>

26:00.185 --> 26:04.523
<i>migrating from their wintering grounds
to their summering grounds.</i>

26:04.523 --> 26:06.775
<i>The journey begins in winter</i>

26:06.775 --> 26:10.571
<i>when the caribou leave their
wintering grounds in the boreal forest.</i>

26:11.655 --> 26:13.073
<i>They travel south,</i>

26:13.073 --> 26:17.703
<i>following the snowmelt, until they reach
their summering grounds in the tundra.</i>

26:18.871 --> 26:20.622
These things always make me cry.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.165
<i>...a thousand miles long.</i>

26:22.165 --> 26:25.794
<i>And it takes the caribou
several months to complete.</i>

26:25.794 --> 26:26.879
Can I--

26:27.379 --> 26:31.258
I'm running an art project at school where
everyone draws a member of their family.

26:31.925 --> 26:32.926
That's nice.

26:34.303 --> 26:35.554
Can I draw you?

26:37.681 --> 26:38.807
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:39.349 --> 26:40.559
It'll be fun.

26:42.352 --> 26:43.520
You mean, like, now?

26:43.520 --> 26:46.523
Yeah. You don't have to do anything.

26:49.026 --> 26:50.360
I can keep watching the documentary?

26:51.153 --> 26:53.071
I really wanna see what happens
to the caribou.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.282
That's fine. I'm gonna get my things.

26:56.742 --> 26:59.077
<i>And their hooves are sharp and pointed.</i>

27:04.249 --> 27:09.379
<i>It is a reminder that even in the harshest
of environments, life can thrive.</i>

27:10.506 --> 27:13.800
<i>The caribou's journey is also important
for the arctic ecosystem.</i>

27:13.800 --> 27:17.095
- Do you wanna draw me after?
- <i>The caribou are a keystone species.</i>

27:17.095 --> 27:18.639
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

27:21.266 --> 27:22.100
Why?

27:22.100 --> 27:24.770
<i>...source for many other animals.</i>

27:24.770 --> 27:27.773
I don't know. It'd be nice.

27:29.858 --> 27:31.401
That's part of the project or...

27:32.319 --> 27:34.530
No. Don't worry.

28:00.222 --> 28:02.015
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.600
Did you want milk and sugar?

28:03.600 --> 28:04.726
No, it's okay.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.228
It has both.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.190
Excuse me. Sorry to bother.

28:10.190 --> 28:13.235
I just had a question.
Is this task based on a movie?

28:13.235 --> 28:14.862
It reminds me of something.

28:14.862 --> 28:16.071
It is.

28:16.071 --> 28:18.365
It's based on the opening scene
of a movie named <i>Jaws</i>.

28:18.365 --> 28:19.449
Heard of it?

28:20.284 --> 28:22.744
I'm joking. It's--
I don't think it's based on a movie.

28:23.662 --> 28:25.038
Okay. Thank you.

28:34.006 --> 28:35.924
They seem so good together.

28:40.179 --> 28:42.306
I don't know. I-- Maybe--

28:42.306 --> 28:44.057
I think they've got something real.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.227
Don't get too carried away.

28:47.895 --> 28:51.273
You know, it's difficult to make
your first big love last. People change.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.942
I know. They're only 21.

28:56.486 --> 28:57.821
You never know.

28:58.572 --> 29:00.908
I mean, it's possible
for people to change together.

29:03.202 --> 29:05.120
- I think it's time to start.
- Okay.

29:07.497 --> 29:11.293
Okay. As I told you, main thing
to watch out for is, are their eyes open?

29:11.793 --> 29:14.379
And then how much are they moving around?
How much are they still?

29:14.379 --> 29:15.714
Basically, have they drowned?

29:15.714 --> 29:18.759
Ideally, we don't want anyone dying on us. Again.

29:21.887 --> 29:22.888
Yeah.

29:33.190 --> 29:36.568
Remember, the aim is to hold eye contact
underwater for one minute.

29:36.568 --> 29:40.656
Okay? Three, two, one. Let's go.

30:22.698 --> 30:24.283
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:24.283 --> 30:25.659
- You okay?
- Yeah.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.786
This is just stuck.

30:30.789 --> 30:31.874
Let me help you.

30:32.583 --> 30:33.417
Thank you.

30:34.835 --> 30:36.003
All right. One, two...

30:36.837 --> 30:38.839
Oh, my God, it really is stuck.

30:47.347 --> 30:48.640
God, it really--

30:49.474 --> 30:50.475
Sorry.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.604
I actually think it looks cooler
like that.

30:53.604 --> 30:54.980
- Yeah.
- I might leave it.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.734
Yeah. It looks great.

31:00.527 --> 31:03.405
Yeah, I'll just take it
to the garage tomorrow. Thank you.

31:04.198 --> 31:05.199
Okay.

31:06.116 --> 31:08.368
- Okay, bye. See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.123
Bye.

31:35.187 --> 31:36.188
Ryan?

32:06.385 --> 32:07.386
Okay, Rob.

32:23.193 --> 32:24.570
Sally, step back.

32:25.654 --> 32:27.114
And let's go.

32:38.709 --> 32:40.169
Okay.

32:46.216 --> 32:48.886
Two, three. Okay.

32:50.304 --> 32:51.471
Go.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.644
- Oh, God.
- Easy. Easy there.

32:58.604 --> 33:00.272
Gently, please. Sorry about that.

33:23.879 --> 33:28.050
Rob, that's a wall.
Yeah, everybody's kind of back this way.

33:44.691 --> 33:48.070
No t-- No touching, Rob.
No touching. Thank you.

34:04.962 --> 34:06.505
I think I found her.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.675
Let's find out. Take off that blindfold.

34:11.635 --> 34:13.637
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

34:13.637 --> 34:15.138
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

34:15.138 --> 34:16.806
What was that?

34:16.806 --> 34:20.268
It means "wonderful." It's--

34:20.268 --> 34:22.271
What? Okay, I haven't heard that before.

34:22.271 --> 34:24.982
Okay. Thank you, everyone.
Well done, and let's take a break.

34:27.442 --> 34:30.362
- Can I try something? I've got an idea.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

34:30.946 --> 34:31.947
That was really great.

34:31.947 --> 34:34.116
I know we asked you not to shower
for a few days

34:34.116 --> 34:35.951
in preparation for this exercise,

34:35.951 --> 34:39.580
but I was wondering maybe if you wanted
to try and take a shower together?

34:39.580 --> 34:44.208
It can be very intimate
to wash each other's bodies.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.503
It might help deepen your connection.

34:47.838 --> 34:48.964
Okay.

34:49.547 --> 34:51.300
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we'll do it.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.802
- Okay. Good work.
- Great. Great.

34:54.636 --> 34:55.679
Thank you.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.769
That is a really good idea.

35:03.604 --> 35:04.646
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:04.646 --> 35:07.816
Yeah. Really, really... It's great.

35:11.236 --> 35:12.237
Seriously.

35:14.239 --> 35:15.365
Thank you.

35:17.492 --> 35:19.203
Yeah, well, it's-- I don't-- It's--

35:19.203 --> 35:21.121
Ryan and I bathe together all the time.

35:21.121 --> 35:22.539
- Yeah.
- Right.

35:22.539 --> 35:24.541
Don't-- you and Natasha?

35:27.669 --> 35:30.255
I think it could help them
deepen their connection.

35:30.255 --> 35:33.634
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah.
- You know? That's what you said.

35:47.189 --> 35:48.065
Fuck.

35:54.655 --> 35:55.489
F--

36:09.545 --> 36:11.505
- You want a coffee before you go?
- No, thank you.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.466
Hey, how are you gonna get in today?

36:15.717 --> 36:17.511
- Taking the bus is really easy.
- Yeah?

36:17.511 --> 36:19.388
Straight to the school gates.

36:19.972 --> 36:21.098
That's great.

36:23.600 --> 36:28.105
Hey, have you met any kids
you think could become famous yet?

36:32.109 --> 36:33.110
Yeah.

36:33.110 --> 36:36.113
There's a boy
who's very good at Ping-Pong.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.574
- Ping-Pong?
- Yeah.

36:39.741 --> 36:41.910
Are there any famous Ping-Pong players?

36:41.910 --> 36:42.995
Yeah.

36:43.704 --> 36:44.788
Yeah?

36:45.455 --> 36:48.917
No. I d-- Let me think.

36:49.793 --> 36:52.129
I mean, there's gotta be
someone famous in Ping-Pong.

36:52.629 --> 36:53.463
Right?

36:55.465 --> 36:57.217
You look really nice today.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.302
Really?

36:59.344 --> 37:01.555
I mean, these pants don't really fit.

37:03.098 --> 37:04.433
I think they...

37:07.227 --> 37:09.354
I think they make your butt
look really nice.

37:10.272 --> 37:11.106
Really?

37:13.150 --> 37:14.484
I think it looks normal.

37:19.781 --> 37:22.743
How would you feel
about being a little late to work?

37:23.827 --> 37:27.581
I have a team meeting first thing.
I'm sorry.

37:27.581 --> 37:28.498
Okay.

37:29.875 --> 37:30.876
Hey.

37:33.712 --> 37:35.088
I'll see you, okay?

37:36.924 --> 37:38.592
- Love you.
- Love you too.

37:46.558 --> 37:48.769
Bye.

38:15.754 --> 38:16.839
Fuck!

38:22.719 --> 38:23.846
Oh, fuck.

38:26.557 --> 38:27.683
Oh, my God.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.077
- Ouch.
- Here you go.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.245
Thank you.

38:48.245 --> 38:51.206
It's the one-year anniversary
of the institute today.

38:51.206 --> 38:53.458
So, I thought we'd have
a party here Saturday.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.294
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

38:55.294 --> 38:58.297
I know it's short notice,
but I hope you can be there.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.842
I usually spend the weekends with Ryan.

39:02.551 --> 39:04.553
Great. Bring him along.
I'd love to meet him.

39:04.553 --> 39:06.930
Well, he's actually
at a conference this weekend, so--

39:06.930 --> 39:08.849
Yeah. And I'm going with him, you know.

39:08.849 --> 39:10.934
Trying to be a supportive partner.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.895
Well, that's nice.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.147
Thank you.

39:15.147 --> 39:16.481
You're welcome.

39:16.982 --> 39:18.775
- I-- Yeah, I better go.
- Okay.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.485
- I'll see you later. Bye.
- Bye.

39:45.302 --> 39:47.596
Sorry.

39:48.305 --> 39:49.932
- Duncan held me up.
- It's all right.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.394
At least they seem
to be enjoying the singing.

39:55.312 --> 39:56.146
Yeah.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.989
Can I ask you something?

40:06.490 --> 40:07.741
What?

40:07.741 --> 40:10.160
Do you know any famous Ping-Pong players?

40:12.162 --> 40:13.413
Not personally.

40:14.957 --> 40:18.794
No. I mean what about Forrest Gump?

40:20.712 --> 40:22.881
- Forrest fucking Gump.
- Does that count?

40:23.715 --> 40:25.259
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

40:30.889 --> 40:33.141
Did Duncan tell you
about the reallocation?

40:34.476 --> 40:37.312
No, he just told me about the party.

40:39.064 --> 40:43.068
Well, he's had an idea.
Thinks that we should specialize more.

40:43.819 --> 40:47.656
So he wants each instructor
to be an expert on a particular age group.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.825
We're gonna be handling couples
in their 30s.

40:56.415 --> 40:57.875
What about Rob and Sally?

40:57.875 --> 41:00.294
- What about them?
- Well, we won't work with them anymore?

41:00.294 --> 41:01.503
No.

41:01.503 --> 41:02.713
Fuck.

41:04.715 --> 41:06.175
I thought they had a really good chance.

41:06.175 --> 41:10.012
I mean, I thought we were
doing really good work with them.

41:10.012 --> 41:14.141
I agree, but Duncan's made up his mind.

41:14.141 --> 41:15.601
Be too complicated now.

41:17.311 --> 41:18.478
I'm sorry.

41:42.961 --> 41:44.213
Feels very sticky.

42:00.979 --> 42:02.189
Why are we doing this?

42:06.485 --> 42:09.905
I don't know. I thought it'd be fun.

42:09.905 --> 42:13.909
No. It's okay.
It's just messy. That's all.

42:17.037 --> 42:19.206
I don't like it. I'm sorry.

42:28.131 --> 42:29.216
Fuck.

42:30.717 --> 42:31.844
It's horrible.

42:38.433 --> 42:40.936
- Should we wait for it to stop?
- Yeah.

42:51.822 --> 42:52.865
Are you okay?

42:54.950 --> 42:55.951
Yeah.

42:59.955 --> 43:01.039
Excuse me.

43:08.881 --> 43:10.549
I need to tell you something.

43:11.133 --> 43:11.967
I...

43:14.928 --> 43:17.181
I haven't been very honest
with you recently.

43:18.599 --> 43:20.601
I didn't take the job at the school.

43:20.601 --> 43:24.229
I've been--

43:25.272 --> 43:28.233
I've been working at the
Love Training Institute downtown.

43:32.321 --> 43:34.990
Why didn't you tell me that?

43:36.950 --> 43:41.455
I don't know. I didn't wanna worry you.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.666
Why would that worry me?

43:45.834 --> 43:47.836
I don't know. I was stupid.

43:47.836 --> 43:50.797
I thought if I told you, you would think
there was something wrong with us.

43:50.797 --> 43:53.133
I don't know-- It was stupid.

43:54.885 --> 43:55.886
Okay.

43:58.847 --> 44:01.850
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I should've.

44:17.032 --> 44:18.492
Don't you wanna say anything?

44:42.307 --> 44:43.600
I'm gonna take a shower.

44:44.393 --> 44:46.061
Do you wanna go first?

44:47.229 --> 44:49.189
No. I'm gonna watch some TV.

44:50.148 --> 44:51.149
Okay.

45:23.724 --> 45:25.601
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:27.102 --> 45:28.395
- Come in?
- Yeah.

45:42.409 --> 45:46.872
Did you lie to me because
that training program is nonsense?

45:49.833 --> 45:50.667
Yes.

45:51.335 --> 45:52.377
Yeah?

45:52.377 --> 45:53.795
Well, I thought if I told you,

45:53.795 --> 45:56.507
you would encourage me
to take the job at school instead.

45:57.549 --> 45:58.634
I wouldn't do that.

46:00.427 --> 46:05.974
I know.
I just really wanted to work there.

46:06.850 --> 46:08.519
I understand that, but it still is--

46:11.563 --> 46:13.815
- Anna, that's fucking serious.
- I know.

46:23.992 --> 46:26.286
Have you ever hidden anything from me?

46:30.874 --> 46:32.584
Nina Simone bores me to death,

46:32.584 --> 46:35.671
but I listen to her songs
because I know you like them.

46:38.173 --> 46:39.174
Okay.

46:42.886 --> 46:45.180
Hey, there's a party
at the office on Saturday.

46:46.014 --> 46:47.266
I told them I couldn't make it,

46:47.266 --> 46:51.311
but if you want to, we could go together.

46:53.522 --> 46:55.440
It'll be nice for you to see where I work.

46:57.609 --> 46:58.944
- You wanna go in?
- Yeah.

47:28.557 --> 47:29.975
<i>Only you</i>

47:33.103 --> 47:38.775
<i>Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game</i>

47:40.319 --> 47:42.696
<i>And I need you</i>

47:43.447 --> 47:46.241
<i>Listen to the words that I say</i>

47:46.241 --> 47:49.369
<i>It's getting harder to stay</i>

47:50.329 --> 47:53.457
<i>When I see you</i>

47:54.458 --> 47:58.212
<i>All I needed was the love you gave</i>

47:59.213 --> 48:02.674
<i>All I needed was another way</i>

48:03.175 --> 48:08.430
<i>And all I ever knew
Only you</i>

48:12.726 --> 48:13.727
We're ready.

48:15.521 --> 48:16.522
Okay.

48:25.906 --> 48:27.157
So, I--

48:28.200 --> 48:30.744
I clamp down and pull?

48:31.453 --> 48:33.330
Yeah. Just press down hard.

48:33.956 --> 48:35.749
When you pull, you pull out, not up.

48:35.749 --> 48:37.417
Okay. Yeah.

48:37.417 --> 48:39.545
This. Not this.

48:39.545 --> 48:40.879
Exactly.

48:40.879 --> 48:42.923
You'll be great.
You've got very steady hands.

48:43.841 --> 48:44.842
Thank you.

48:44.842 --> 48:46.343
- We're ready.
- Yeah.

48:46.343 --> 48:48.220
- Okay. Could you grab that?
- Yeah.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.388
Thanks.

48:52.766 --> 48:53.642
Okay.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.396
Okay. So, you know how the test works?

48:57.396 --> 48:58.730
- Yes.
- Yes.

48:58.730 --> 48:59.857
So, how you feeling?

49:00.357 --> 49:02.025
I think we're feeling pretty confident

49:02.025 --> 49:04.194
- after all those exercises.
- Great.

49:04.194 --> 49:06.572
We have been having sex
every night this week

49:06.572 --> 49:08.574
for at least an hour each time.

49:08.574 --> 49:12.160
Lucky you.
Well, this will be quicker than that.

49:13.203 --> 49:14.371
Shall we?

49:16.248 --> 49:17.249
Here you go.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.586
They usually don't scream
if you wanna-- No.

49:21.253 --> 49:23.088
- Okay. You're gonna bite down.
- You ready?

49:23.088 --> 49:26.592
- Great. Okay, just bite down on that.
- Thank you.

49:27.926 --> 49:29.386
Have you chosen which nail?

49:29.386 --> 49:31.388
- Yeah.
- That's a good nail.

49:36.226 --> 49:37.227
Ready?

49:37.895 --> 49:40.105
Okay. Three, two, one.

49:49.990 --> 49:51.200
It'll pass.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.869
- Happens every day. Okay?
- You're doing great.

49:56.413 --> 49:57.497
You're doing great.

49:59.166 --> 50:01.710
Okay. Let me have a look at that.

50:01.710 --> 50:03.545
- That looks fine.
- Keep your fingers straight.

50:03.545 --> 50:04.630
You're doing good.

51:03.981 --> 51:04.982
Do you want some?

51:06.024 --> 51:07.150
Thanks. I can't.

51:07.150 --> 51:11.363
I'm gluten intolerant. Yeah.

51:11.864 --> 51:13.657
So, if I have any, I'll die in pain.

51:13.657 --> 51:15.909
- Oh, my gosh. Sorry.
- It's okay.

51:15.909 --> 51:19.454
It means it's--
I have to eat more healthily, and--

51:19.454 --> 51:22.082
I mean, I miss the taste
of some things, but it's fine.

51:23.792 --> 51:24.835
Yeah.

51:38.932 --> 51:40.809
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

51:43.770 --> 51:44.771
To what?

51:45.397 --> 51:46.773
To all the zero percents.

51:48.233 --> 51:50.485
Did you think they would get
a positive result?

51:53.405 --> 51:56.700
No. No, not at all, really.

51:57.576 --> 52:00.162
You know, but even when
you know they're not going to get there,

52:00.162 --> 52:01.622
at least they're trying.

52:03.916 --> 52:05.417
And it gets worse than that.

52:05.417 --> 52:08.337
The worst is when you think
they're perfect for each other and still...

52:11.590 --> 52:14.843
Look, I know you're sad
because we've lost Rob and Sally too,

52:14.843 --> 52:19.473
but I promise you, next time,
we'll nail it.

52:45.541 --> 52:47.000
This is my girlfriend, Gina.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.002
- Hi. Ryan. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi. Anna.

52:49.002 --> 52:51.004
- Thank you so much for coming tonight.
- Of course.

52:51.004 --> 52:54.174
- It's a pretty exciting evening. One year.
- You look amazing.

52:59.054 --> 53:00.180
I know, right?

53:01.807 --> 53:03.100
Now, I understand you're in sales?

53:03.100 --> 53:05.060
- Hey, everyone. Hey. This is Natasha.
- Hi.

53:05.060 --> 53:08.939
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

53:08.939 --> 53:11.316
- Hi. Hey. Ryan. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.

53:11.316 --> 53:13.652
- I'm with Anna. Yeah.
- Hi, there. Duncan. Nice to meet you.

53:13.652 --> 53:14.820
- Hey.
- Hey. Ryan.

53:14.820 --> 53:16.280
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

53:16.280 --> 53:17.948
- Hey. Nice to meet you. Ryan.
- Ryan?

53:17.948 --> 53:19.074
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

53:19.074 --> 53:20.450
I've heard a lot about you.

53:20.450 --> 53:21.869
- Yeah?
- From Anna. Yeah.

53:22.369 --> 53:23.704
We've been working together, haven't we?

53:23.704 --> 53:25.622
- Last few weeks.
- We have.

53:25.622 --> 53:27.416
Sorry, your name was...

53:27.416 --> 53:28.876
- Amir.
- Amir. Right.

53:28.876 --> 53:30.669
No, I've heard about you too. Yeah.

53:30.669 --> 53:32.713
- Cool.
- Nice.

53:34.089 --> 53:35.507
- Oh, yeah, he is.
- Yeah.

53:35.507 --> 53:37.801
It's been very exciting
having him on the team, so...

53:37.801 --> 53:39.803
Congratulations. I just wanted to say.

53:39.803 --> 53:41.013
- Yeah, I mean...
- Thank you.

53:43.307 --> 53:45.934
Hey, I spoke to Duncan,
and we can keep Sally and Rob.

53:45.934 --> 53:47.227
- What?
- Yeah.

53:49.521 --> 53:50.606
That's amazing.

53:53.650 --> 53:54.776
- Yes.
- Thought you'd like it.

55:01.093 --> 55:03.387
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

55:03.387 --> 55:05.806
Are you enjoying the party?

55:05.806 --> 55:07.224
Yeah, everyone's so nice.

55:07.224 --> 55:09.518
Well, you and Amir are such great dancers.

55:10.185 --> 55:11.770
Well, we have fun.

55:14.398 --> 55:16.525
- Can I get you a slice?
- Yes, please.

55:16.525 --> 55:19.987
And one for Amir too, if you don't mind.
Thank you.

55:22.322 --> 55:25.200
I think it might have gluten.

55:26.743 --> 55:27.744
Why is that a problem?

55:28.495 --> 55:32.958
Well, I mean,
Amir will die from pain if he eats gluten.

55:33.876 --> 55:35.002
His allergy?

55:36.879 --> 55:38.755
Right. That's right.

55:38.755 --> 55:41.049
He is gluten-free. I just-- I forgot. So...

55:41.550 --> 55:42.968
- Don't tell him I forgot.
- No.

55:43.635 --> 55:45.596
- So just-- I'll take the one. Thank you.
- The one?

55:54.188 --> 55:56.690
Great. Great. Thank you.

55:57.357 --> 55:58.942
See you out there.

57:32.411 --> 57:33.495
- Hey.
- Hi.

57:33.495 --> 57:35.873
I'm just gonna go grab some beers.
We're all out.

57:36.415 --> 57:37.624
You leaving?

57:37.624 --> 57:39.418
Yeah.

57:39.418 --> 57:42.504
Ryan, he forgot his scarf.
He's just gone inside.

57:43.046 --> 57:46.049
All right. I'll wait with you.

57:46.049 --> 57:47.384
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57:52.639 --> 57:53.974
Where's Natasha?

57:53.974 --> 57:56.685
She's gone home. Yeah. Early start.

58:11.033 --> 58:12.242
What?

58:15.287 --> 58:16.121
Sorry.

58:17.623 --> 58:19.458
Sorry, I was just-- I was thinking.

58:21.084 --> 58:22.085
Yeah.

58:24.713 --> 58:28.967
What's the purpose
of the underwater exercise?

58:30.177 --> 58:31.512
You know, with the staring?

58:31.512 --> 58:33.347
I knew it.
You never looked at the materials.

58:33.347 --> 58:34.890
I could tell.

58:34.890 --> 58:37.267
- Just making it all up as you went along.
- Yes, I did.

58:39.353 --> 58:41.813
It's supposed to simulate
the feeling of breathlessness.

58:42.898 --> 58:45.067
And the action of staring
into each other's eyes.

58:45.067 --> 58:47.611
It can create-- I don't know-- intimacy.

58:51.240 --> 58:53.825
It's a nice idea. They all are.

58:53.825 --> 58:56.036
I mean, once you're reminded of it

58:56.036 --> 58:58.789
you realize how little any of us
look each other in the eyes anymore.

59:02.292 --> 59:03.293
Yeah.

59:04.628 --> 59:06.797
We're so fucking stupid.

59:08.966 --> 59:11.677
- Well, not you. Well, not just you.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

59:12.511 --> 59:14.930
And I am fucking stupid.

59:29.611 --> 59:31.071
- Hey.
- Hi.

59:31.071 --> 59:33.031
- Got it.
- Great.

59:33.031 --> 59:35.409
- You set? Okay. Good.
- Yeah.

59:35.409 --> 59:37.119
Hey, man, so nice meeting you.

59:38.370 --> 59:39.371
Have a good night.

59:39.872 --> 59:41.290
- See ya.
- Night.

01:00:34.092 --> 01:00:36.345
What time
did the party finish on Saturday?

01:00:36.845 --> 01:00:38.096
Next.

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:39.806
About 5:00 a.m.

01:00:40.891 --> 01:00:41.975
I liked your dancing.

01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:45.729
Thank you.

01:00:54.404 --> 01:00:55.531
How are you two doing?

01:00:55.531 --> 01:00:59.076
I'm excited! I've never done this before!

01:00:59.785 --> 01:01:03.038
I'm a bit scared,
but we'll do it together.

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:09.169
Yeah!

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.171
All right, it's our turn now.

01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.632
- Yeah, we can do this. Okay?
- No. I--

01:01:14.132 --> 01:01:16.343
- I can't-- No, I can't do this.
- We got this.

01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:19.179
- We can do this.
- I can't-- I can't fucking do this.

01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:20.347
Is everything okay?

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:24.935
We were just wondering
if this exercise is really necessary.

01:01:26.395 --> 01:01:28.480
Well, we have found that the adrenaline,

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.109
you know, and having your lives in
each other's hands, it's pretty effective.

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:35.237
It's just that my partner, Andrew,

01:01:35.237 --> 01:01:37.698
he just told me that
he has a deathly fear of heights.

01:01:37.698 --> 01:01:39.658
It's, like, deathly.

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:44.955
What if we go with,
like, an instructor or someone?

01:01:47.207 --> 01:01:49.668
What if one of you
falls in love with the instructor?

01:01:54.256 --> 01:01:57.217
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to, okay?

01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:59.052
Just have a seat.
We'll work it out for later.

01:01:59.052 --> 01:02:00.137
Thank you.

01:02:01.972 --> 01:02:03.056
Next.

01:02:07.477 --> 01:02:09.229
- You good? All right.
- I'm good.

01:02:10.063 --> 01:02:11.815
Don't forget to pull the cord, okay?

01:02:11.815 --> 01:02:12.900
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:02:45.307 --> 01:02:46.558
<i>Wunderbar.</i>

01:02:55.943 --> 01:02:57.528
Look out. Watch out.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.700
- We'll be right there!
- Hello?

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.370
We're here. Over here.

01:03:29.601 --> 01:03:31.436
You think this red light's
gonna last forever?

01:03:35.649 --> 01:03:37.442
Do you have a change of clothes
at the office?

01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:39.862
Yeah, I'm wearing it.

01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:44.491
Well, do you wanna go by your place
and pick up some? I don't mind.

01:03:48.161 --> 01:03:50.581
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll be quick.

01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:05.804
All right. I'll be quick.

01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:07.472
Do you mind if I come up?

01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:09.183
I'll be two minutes.

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:12.811
Oh, yeah.
Just to wash the mud off my hands.

01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:15.105
- Right.
- Unless I'll bother Natasha.

01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:17.274
Oh, no. Nat--

01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:19.860
Natasha's at work. It's just messy.

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:23.697
I haven't had a chance to--
You know. It's gross.

01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:26.658
Oh, yeah. Okay. No, I'll stay here.

01:04:30.454 --> 01:04:31.663
You know what? Come up.

01:04:32.497 --> 01:04:33.582
Yeah?

01:04:33.582 --> 01:04:36.710
Yeah, I'll make you a coffee.

01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:39.796
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:21.964
Hey.

01:05:22.756 --> 01:05:25.425
You can sit here.

01:05:25.425 --> 01:05:26.510
Yeah.

01:05:27.302 --> 01:05:28.637
And this is for you.

01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:32.641
Yeah. And...

01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:36.061
if you get bored,

01:05:37.938 --> 01:05:39.064
then this is...

01:05:41.859 --> 01:05:43.026
interesting.

01:05:45.237 --> 01:05:48.490
Okay. Yeah. Quick read.

01:05:49.283 --> 01:05:50.284
Yeah.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:53.954
I'll be quick.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:20.624
Anna.

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:24.878
Yeah?

01:07:34.263 --> 01:07:35.389
Nothing.

01:07:40.727 --> 01:07:42.646
- I'll just be ready in a minute.
- Okay.

01:08:42.663 --> 01:08:44.917
- Anna.
- You okay?

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:48.462
I don't wanna lose him.

01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:51.798
Don't worry, Sally.

01:08:52.716 --> 01:08:55.594
But what if it's--
I mean, what do we do then?

01:08:55.594 --> 01:08:58.221
Hey, it's gonna be fine. Okay?

01:08:59.555 --> 01:09:00.682
Why don't you sit down?

01:09:01.808 --> 01:09:03.393
Here, take a seat.

01:09:04.937 --> 01:09:06.188
I don't think I like this.

01:09:06.897 --> 01:09:08.148
That's okay. Don't worry.

01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:10.901
No, I really don't like this.

01:09:10.901 --> 01:09:14.571
Rob, it's just a brief, little
moment of pain, and then it's done. Okay?

01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:16.323
I don't wanna do it.

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:18.783
Okay. Hey.

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:25.332
Close your eyes.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.919
Open your mouth. Bite down. Okay?

01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:33.173
I'm not doing it.

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:35.091
Rob. Rob, look at me.

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:39.263
It's gonna be okay.
We've waited a long time to do this.

01:09:39.263 --> 01:09:42.515
I'm sorry, Sally.
I'm just fucking freaking out.

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:44.268
You know how I feel about blood.

01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:46.770
There's really not a lot of blood.

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:50.607
Look, I'm scared too.
But it'll be quick. Right?

01:09:50.607 --> 01:09:52.234
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

01:09:52.234 --> 01:09:53.819
Look, you guys have been so nice to us,

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:56.113
- but I'm not in the right place for this.
- Rob, look at me.

01:09:56.113 --> 01:09:58.407
Look at me. Listen, I know you're afraid.

01:09:58.407 --> 01:10:00.367
And more than that,
I know you feel vulnerable.

01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:02.744
I know exactly how that feels.

01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:06.290
I've done this before.

01:10:07.332 --> 01:10:08.625
It's not as bad as you think.

01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:10.335
- Look at it. Look.
- I don't care.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.173
You don't have to do it right now.
I have to. Not you.

01:10:15.048 --> 01:10:18.218
Rob, look-- Just sit down and do it.
I want you to do this.

01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:20.470
Sally,
do you realize this is a form of torture?

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:23.223
- My God. You really--
- What do you think?

01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:27.186
I just didn't expect him
to behave like that.

01:10:27.186 --> 01:10:30.147
Why did we do all these exercises?
Just sit down.

01:10:30.147 --> 01:10:32.482
- Look, I'm--
- Just sit down and do it.

01:10:32.482 --> 01:10:33.942
Do you think they're gonna leave?

01:10:33.942 --> 01:10:35.485
Sally, you realize this
is a form of punishment?

01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:36.570
I'll do it.

01:10:37.571 --> 01:10:38.572
What?

01:10:40.282 --> 01:10:41.283
I'll do it.

01:10:41.825 --> 01:10:43.744
- Please, Rob--
- Just-- Come on.

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:46.455
- Rob, look at me. It's not that bad.
- We can go right now. Please.

01:10:46.455 --> 01:10:48.916
I'm gonna show you. Okay?

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:52.711
If I do it, will you do it?

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:54.213
- Are you doing it?
- What?

01:10:54.796 --> 01:10:56.298
If I do it, will you do it?

01:10:56.298 --> 01:10:58.175
Wh-- I mean--

01:10:59.176 --> 01:11:00.677
I don't know. I mean...

01:11:02.679 --> 01:11:03.680
maybe.

01:11:05.599 --> 01:11:08.894
Okay. Then I'm gonna do it,
and you're gonna see it's not that bad.

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:12.064
And-- But then it's your turn.

01:11:15.692 --> 01:11:16.527
Okay.

01:11:18.612 --> 01:11:21.198
- No. Whoa. What are you doing?
- Okay. Okay.

01:11:21.198 --> 01:11:23.408
We can just reschedule.
This isn't a big deal.

01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:24.618
We can just reschedule.

01:11:30.123 --> 01:11:31.917
Oh, my God.

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:34.962
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:36.463
Oh, my God.

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.049
It's just a little scratch.

01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.136
Just a little scratch.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.264
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:49.142
- Okay. You're up next.
- You're gonna do it, right, Rob?

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:52.980
- Look up there.
- No, no. It's all right.

01:11:54.648 --> 01:11:57.526
You think you can do it?
You're gonna do it, Rob?

01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:58.610
Thank you.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:04.491
Hey, you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:12:04.491 --> 01:12:05.659
I'll be okay.

01:12:23.927 --> 01:12:26.513
- You did really well.
- Thank you.

01:12:26.513 --> 01:12:29.558
- We're almost... Done.
- Hey. You did great.

01:12:29.558 --> 01:12:30.642
Thank you.

01:12:31.435 --> 01:12:33.395
Okay. Coming back soon.

01:12:34.146 --> 01:12:35.147
Yeah.

01:13:05.969 --> 01:13:06.970
Thank you.

01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:29.868
Can you just take one step to your left?

01:13:30.953 --> 01:13:33.372
Yeah-- Split the difference.

01:13:34.164 --> 01:13:35.999
- Yeah, perfect.
- Okay.

01:13:41.713 --> 01:13:44.299
Well, congratulations.

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.094
- Thank you.
- Well done. Of course.

01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:49.555
- Thank you.
- Good job.

01:13:53.976 --> 01:13:57.813
Okay, great. If I could just
get you looking here, please.

01:13:58.689 --> 01:14:00.399
Perfect. Okay.

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:02.985
We'll do one more.
Just gonna make a slight adjustment here.

01:14:02.985 --> 01:14:05.070
Thank you for your patience.

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.865
Looks great. Looks great.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:09.783
Okay, ready?

01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:36.930
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:43.896 --> 01:16:45.314
How was your day?

01:16:45.939 --> 01:16:46.940
Difficult.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.442
Why? What happened?

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:49.776
It was Ronan again.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.405
He came in completely unprepared and--

01:16:54.364 --> 01:16:57.451
I don't know, he just made me
look like an idiot in the presentation.

01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:01.038
What happened?

01:17:01.038 --> 01:17:05.709
I tripped in the street
and sprained my fingers.

01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:07.461
Did you go to the hospital?

01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:09.296
No. It's fine. It's just in case.

01:17:09.838 --> 01:17:12.007
- You sure?
- It's fine. Yeah. Are you hungry?

01:17:12.758 --> 01:17:14.218
Yeah. Starving.

01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:18.639
Do you want some leftovers from yesterday?

01:17:18.639 --> 01:17:19.723
Sure.

01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:23.227
You sure you're okay?

01:17:24.478 --> 01:17:25.479
Yeah.

01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:44.373
Hi. Is Duncan busy?

01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:46.083
- No. Go ahead.
- Okay. Great.

01:17:50.212 --> 01:17:51.338
Do you have a moment?

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:52.422
Of course.

01:17:57.928 --> 01:17:58.929
What's the--

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:04.685
I was with my son, Milo, yesterday,

01:18:04.685 --> 01:18:06.520
and we were playing with these.

01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:09.940
He made them fly through space.

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:12.985
Then he was trying to make them kiss.

01:18:14.987 --> 01:18:16.572
I didn't know you had a son.

01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:20.284
I do. He's nine now. A great kid.

01:18:20.868 --> 01:18:22.369
He's from my previous marriage.

01:18:23.161 --> 01:18:25.247
His mother and I divorced three years ago.

01:18:26.123 --> 01:18:27.499
We had a negative test.

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:31.211
And-- Well, that's why
we're no longer together.

01:18:33.172 --> 01:18:37.217
Anyhow. What can I help you with?

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:40.929
I was wondering if it was possible that

01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:43.390
one person could be in love--

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:47.519
I mean, have a positive result
with two people at the same time?

01:18:48.187 --> 01:18:50.397
Yeah. Sadly, it's not possible.

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:52.065
It'd be like--

01:18:53.025 --> 01:18:54.860
It'd be like a six-months-pregnant woman

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.362
suddenly becoming pregnant
with another child.

01:18:57.362 --> 01:18:59.573
Biological impossibility.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:02.409
Yeah. That's what I thought too, yeah.

01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:08.457
So, he's singing about his mother?

01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:13.212
No. "<i>La mer</i>" means "the sea."
So, he's singing about the sea.

01:19:14.087 --> 01:19:15.130
Which sea?

01:19:18.717 --> 01:19:19.718
Good question.

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.637
Not any particular sea.

01:19:22.346 --> 01:19:25.766
But just more the sea in general.

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:28.977
All the seas?

01:19:32.105 --> 01:19:35.442
You know, it's more like-- more--

01:19:37.027 --> 01:19:38.946
more the sea as a kind of idea.

01:19:39.863 --> 01:19:41.615
You know? And the idea is...

01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:47.162
It's love.

01:19:48.956 --> 01:19:50.290
Yeah, the sea is love.

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:53.627
And what about the rest of the lyrics?

01:19:56.505 --> 01:20:01.051
He's singing
about white sheep and white birds

01:20:01.051 --> 01:20:05.180
and angels and little, rusted houses.
It's--

01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:09.268
- And how is any of that romantic?
- It just is. It's--

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.312
There's a feeling that just--

01:20:14.314 --> 01:20:17.484
The music is very romantic.
It almost doesn't matter what he's saying.

01:20:18.527 --> 01:20:19.862
Should I sing now?

01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:21.864
Please.

01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:19.922
- Oh, shit.
- Not again.

01:21:29.806 --> 01:21:30.641
Okay, wait.

01:21:30.641 --> 01:21:32.100
I think it's--

01:21:36.063 --> 01:21:37.856
- Take it.
- Can I?

01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:20.983
Thanks for the lift.

01:22:20.983 --> 01:22:23.569
No worries. Try not to hurt yourself.

01:22:24.278 --> 01:22:25.279
Yeah, I'll try.

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:27.698
Can I ask you something?

01:22:29.575 --> 01:22:31.243
Why do you work at the institute?

01:22:34.538 --> 01:22:36.874
- I mean--
- I like pulling out people's fingernails.

01:22:38.917 --> 01:22:40.502
What? I'm trying to open up here.

01:22:44.923 --> 01:22:48.886
I just wanted to be there. You know?

01:22:50.262 --> 01:22:52.848
Maybe understand love a little better.
Thought I did.

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:56.810
But I don-- Lately--

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:01.273
Especially lately, I'm not so sure.

01:23:03.984 --> 01:23:04.985
Yeah.

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:11.116
Thanks.

01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:13.744
You're welcome.

01:23:15.913 --> 01:23:17.289
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:19.625
See you tomorrow.

01:23:37.518 --> 01:23:39.770
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:43.190
<i>what holds the planets
in orbit around the sun?</i>

01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:48.028
<i>Or what keeps us
from floating off into space?</i>

01:23:48.654 --> 01:23:51.156
<i>The answer is gravity.</i>

01:23:53.242 --> 01:23:55.160
You remember
it's Carrie's birthday tomorrow?

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.162
Yeah. I got her a present yesterday.

01:23:58.664 --> 01:24:00.207
I didn't see it. What did you get?

01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:02.793
Sorry. I forgot to tell you. An album.

01:24:03.335 --> 01:24:04.336
Which one?

01:24:05.003 --> 01:24:06.380
<i>The Best of Nina Simone</i>.

01:24:08.423 --> 01:24:10.259
I hope you got the gift receipt.

01:24:12.261 --> 01:24:14.847
I think it's kind of cool
that they retook the test. Don't you?

01:24:16.265 --> 01:24:19.685
I was thinking since I work there
and get a discount,

01:24:19.685 --> 01:24:22.479
that we could take advantage
of it and do it again.

01:24:25.232 --> 01:24:26.942
Yeah. You know, just for fun.

01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:32.781
No way. That's not my idea of fun,
having my fingernails ripped out.

01:24:33.657 --> 01:24:34.825
I know, it's just--

01:24:36.285 --> 01:24:38.537
You know, the institute has got
such a good reputation,

01:24:38.537 --> 01:24:39.663
and with the discount--

01:24:39.663 --> 01:24:42.416
Yeah, we've already passed the test.
Why would we take it again?

01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:45.335
Well, 'cause, like,
Carrie and Andy took it.

01:24:45.335 --> 01:24:47.129
I don't care what other people do.

01:24:47.129 --> 01:24:49.840
<i>...that we still don't fully understand.</i>

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:53.594
<i>But it's one of the most important forces
in the universe.</i>

01:24:54.136 --> 01:24:55.387
<i>And it's what makes life</i>

01:24:55.387 --> 01:24:57.014
<i>on Earth possible.</i>

01:24:58.891 --> 01:25:01.935
- <i>Without gravity the planet...</i>
- Do you think that we should...

01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:03.645
<i>...would fly off into space.</i>

01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:06.190
...do it? To retake the test?

01:25:07.774 --> 01:25:09.109
And have your feelings changed?

01:25:11.236 --> 01:25:12.237
No.

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:18.327
Yeah, 'cause my feelings haven't changed.

01:25:20.954 --> 01:25:24.750
You know, if anything, I feel like
my feelings have only gotten stronger.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:26.668
- Yeah, but it's not about that.
- What's it about?

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:27.753
It's--

01:25:30.839 --> 01:25:32.758
I don't know. It's--

01:25:38.555 --> 01:25:40.307
I don't wanna have this conversation.

01:25:49.024 --> 01:25:50.901
I'm sorry, what do you want?

01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:56.240
Yeah, I think it's normal to get
into a bit of a routine.

01:25:57.074 --> 01:25:59.368
Right? I think
that's the nature of a relationship.

01:25:59.368 --> 01:26:01.078
You can't take it for granted.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:06.250
I think a relationship should be worked on
every day. All the time.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.334
Okay.

01:26:09.795 --> 01:26:10.796
And?

01:26:13.966 --> 01:26:15.133
Nothing. Forget it.

01:26:56.216 --> 01:26:57.342
Why aren't you sleeping?

01:27:01.889 --> 01:27:03.098
Can't sleep.

01:27:11.106 --> 01:27:12.858
Okay. Let's go and do it now.

01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:18.197
What? Now?

01:27:18.697 --> 01:27:19.698
Yeah.

01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:56.360
Do you wanna come
and see the results together?

01:28:29.142 --> 01:28:30.853
I don't know
how I'm gonna explain this at work.

01:28:33.313 --> 01:28:34.523
It was positive.

01:28:36.275 --> 01:28:37.776
Why do you need to explain it?

01:28:43.198 --> 01:28:44.700
We're never doing this again.

01:28:47.578 --> 01:28:48.579
Yeah.

01:29:07.347 --> 01:29:09.725
Morning.

01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:13.729
Amir. I--

01:29:15.689 --> 01:29:17.441
I need to talk to you about something.

01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:21.028
I--

01:29:23.071 --> 01:29:24.156
I--

01:29:25.324 --> 01:29:28.911
Hi, excuse me.
So, Marcus, he's out sick today.

01:29:28.911 --> 01:29:31.288
But he had two clients
that were due for testing right now.

01:29:31.288 --> 01:29:34.124
Would you two mind stepping in?
I'm sorry for the late notice.

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:35.876
Yeah. Sure.

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:38.086
Yeah, it's fi-- I don't think
we have any tests booked this morning.

01:29:38.086 --> 01:29:40.964
Great. There's his file.
Just take a quick look at it.

01:29:40.964 --> 01:29:42.257
Thank you.

01:29:47.012 --> 01:29:48.138
What were you gonna say?

01:29:50.057 --> 01:29:51.099
Nothing.

01:29:59.149 --> 01:30:00.150
Okay.

01:30:00.943 --> 01:30:02.528
I'll go set up the tests.

01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:04.112
Okay.

01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:40.899
Amir, would you mind
taking a look at something?

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:43.402
- Sure.
- What? Is everything okay?

01:30:43.402 --> 01:30:44.736
Yeah.

01:30:44.736 --> 01:30:46.905
I think there's
something wrong with the machine.

01:30:48.323 --> 01:30:49.324
Won't be a minute.

01:30:55.330 --> 01:30:57.457
There was a strange sound,
and then it just stopped.

01:30:57.457 --> 01:30:59.376
Oh, shit.

01:31:05.883 --> 01:31:07.092
Shit.

01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:10.095
Okay.

01:31:17.603 --> 01:31:18.604
Okay.

01:31:26.778 --> 01:31:28.113
Okay, what are we gonna tell 'em?

01:31:38.290 --> 01:31:39.541
I need to tell you something.

01:31:40.876 --> 01:31:41.877
What?

01:31:41.877 --> 01:31:43.378
I tested our fingernails.

01:31:47.007 --> 01:31:48.842
What? Wait, whose fingernails?

01:31:50.177 --> 01:31:51.178
Ours.

01:31:53.096 --> 01:31:55.182
What do-- How did--

01:32:00.687 --> 01:32:02.439
Look, I know you're not with Natasha.

01:32:04.316 --> 01:32:05.984
She doesn't know anything about you.

01:32:11.198 --> 01:32:12.908
She's my neighbor.

01:32:15.452 --> 01:32:16.537
What were the results?

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:18.622
Fifty percent.

01:32:22.668 --> 01:32:23.669
So I...

01:32:26.421 --> 01:32:31.718
I retested with Ryan last night
and it was 100%.

01:32:34.137 --> 01:32:37.266
Excuse me? Is everything okay in there?

01:32:43.772 --> 01:32:46.817
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know what it means.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:52.447
I mean, maybe that-- I don't know.
Maybe that you're in--

01:32:55.242 --> 01:32:57.494
you're in love with me, and...

01:32:59.538 --> 01:33:00.914
I'm not in love with you.

01:33:02.708 --> 01:33:03.709
Hello?

01:33:11.258 --> 01:33:13.844
Yeah, I think it does.

01:33:19.266 --> 01:33:20.392
I just gotta--

01:33:41.371 --> 01:33:43.123
Thanks. Okay.

01:33:47.336 --> 01:33:48.629
- Take care. All right.
- Thanks.

01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:49.671
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:33:50.214 --> 01:33:51.548
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:33:53.592 --> 01:33:56.386
It's a shame
they got a negative test result.

01:33:56.386 --> 01:33:59.014
But I am glad
we got the machine fixed quickly.

01:33:59.014 --> 01:34:01.725
Make sure to send them vouchers
for a free test, all right?

01:34:03.894 --> 01:34:04.978
Where did Amir go?

01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:06.897
I have no idea.

01:34:07.564 --> 01:34:08.815
He called me.

01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:12.069
He had to leave urgently.
He said he wasn't feeling well.

01:34:12.611 --> 01:34:14.655
He might have to miss a few days of work.

01:34:15.989 --> 01:34:17.991
Maybe it's the same thing that Marcus had.

01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:20.327
I guess we'll get it figured out tomorrow.

01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:59.533
- Hey! Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

01:35:47.915 --> 01:35:49.750
I'm gonna go and grab something to eat.

01:35:51.043 --> 01:35:52.377
It's past midnight.

01:35:52.377 --> 01:35:54.379
I know. I didn't eat much at the party.

01:35:55.422 --> 01:35:56.965
I think we have something in the fridge.

01:35:56.965 --> 01:36:00.052
I feel like chicken soup.
Do you want some?

01:36:02.513 --> 01:36:03.514
No. I'm tired.

01:36:06.433 --> 01:36:07.434
Okay.

01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:10.437
Okay.

01:36:49.434 --> 01:36:50.602
Hi.

01:36:52.563 --> 01:36:53.564
Hi.

01:36:53.564 --> 01:36:55.274
I brought you some soup.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:58.402
You were sick, so I brought you some soup.

01:37:02.322 --> 01:37:03.323
Yeah.

01:37:11.206 --> 01:37:12.457
Do you want to eat it now?

01:37:19.047 --> 01:37:20.799
- Now, now?
- Yeah.

01:37:47.075 --> 01:37:48.076
Soup's really bad.

01:37:49.286 --> 01:37:50.287
I know.

01:37:51.538 --> 01:37:53.332
I'm sorry.

01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:57.419
It was the only place that was open.

01:37:57.419 --> 01:38:00.839
It's fine. Just don't ask me to eat it.

01:38:00.839 --> 01:38:01.924
Okay.

01:38:08.347 --> 01:38:09.723
I think I--

01:38:14.937 --> 01:38:16.355
I think I wanna kiss you.

01:39:38.937 --> 01:39:41.690
You have a scar just there.

01:39:47.362 --> 01:39:50.324
Yeah. Yeah, I had my appendix out.

01:39:50.324 --> 01:39:51.658
Think I was eight.

01:39:53.035 --> 01:39:54.786
Looks like a tiny train track.

01:40:00.209 --> 01:40:01.210
It does.

01:40:03.504 --> 01:40:04.338
Tickles.

01:40:12.054 --> 01:40:13.055
What about Ryan?

01:40:27.402 --> 01:40:28.403
I don't know.

01:40:32.574 --> 01:40:33.575
Sometimes...

01:40:36.537 --> 01:40:40.874
I don't know. Sometimes being in love
is lonelier than being alone, you know?

01:40:48.882 --> 01:40:50.551
So, I've tested many times.

01:40:52.678 --> 01:40:55.931
I've never been positive till now.

01:40:58.141 --> 01:41:02.479
And-- Yeah. So, I just wanted to know
what was wrong with me.

01:41:05.983 --> 01:41:07.192
What's wrong with me?

01:41:11.989 --> 01:41:13.240
I don't wanna go back.

01:41:17.369 --> 01:41:18.704
As in you wanna stay the night?

01:41:20.497 --> 01:41:21.707
Yeah, I wanna stay here.

01:41:41.435 --> 01:41:42.644
I would love that.

01:41:47.482 --> 01:41:48.942
I would really love that.

01:41:59.661 --> 01:42:00.913
But you saw the test.

01:42:03.498 --> 01:42:04.917
I don't care.

01:42:04.917 --> 01:42:08.170
You tested positive with Ryan. Twice.

01:42:15.219 --> 01:42:16.345
I'm thirsty.

01:42:32.903 --> 01:42:34.446
Maybe it's better if you leave.

01:42:37.616 --> 01:42:38.617
Is that what you want?

01:42:39.409 --> 01:42:40.244
No.

01:42:43.372 --> 01:42:44.540
But what are we gonna do?

01:42:49.169 --> 01:42:50.170
I don't know.

01:42:56.009 --> 01:42:57.261
I'm tired.

01:43:10.983 --> 01:43:11.984
Okay.

01:43:13.443 --> 01:43:15.904
Hey.

01:43:17.656 --> 01:43:18.657
Just stay the night.

01:43:21.243 --> 01:43:22.744
I'll take you home in the morning.

01:46:12.831 --> 01:46:13.832
Anna?

01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:17.669
Anna, What are you doing?

01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:19.171
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

01:46:20.672 --> 01:46:21.924
What have you done?

01:46:24.009 --> 01:46:25.219
Why would you do this?

01:46:26.178 --> 01:46:28.347
- I don't--
- Look at me. I'm here.

01:46:28.347 --> 01:46:30.891
- I don't want them anymore.
- I'm right here with you.

01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:34.478
- Okay.
- I'm here with you. Okay?

01:46:35.562 --> 01:46:37.940
Okay? Okay.

01:46:42.194 --> 01:46:43.862
Shouldn't have done this.

01:46:45.864 --> 01:46:47.074
I'm here with you, Anna.

01:46:49.701 --> 01:46:50.994
It's okay.

01:47:25.863 --> 01:47:27.072
This is gonna hurt.
