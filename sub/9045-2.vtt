Previously on Awkward...

00:02.043 --> 00:04.659
Matty McKibben wanted me
to meet him until the closet.

00:04.825 --> 00:06.342
Nobody can know that I like you.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.925
"Jenna, you could disappear,
and no one would notice."

00:09.425 --> 00:11.803
Sometimes being a teenager
makes you want to die.

00:11.969 --> 00:14.556
- Our daughter is suicidal.
- It was a misunderstanding

00:14.722 --> 00:16.058
of epic proportions.

00:16.302 --> 00:18.393
The loser wants us to talk about her.

00:18.559 --> 00:21.271
- That's why she did it.
- What is the fascination with me?

00:21.437 --> 00:24.126
Everyone's gonna stare.
I might as well go onstage.

00:24.732 --> 00:26.777
You have some serious backbone.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.279
<i>It was the dawn of a new beginning.</i>

00:29.610 --> 00:31.644
<i>My sideshow status as a suicide freak</i>

00:31.769 --> 00:33.659
<i>was about to end, and my creeper gear</i>

00:33.825 --> 00:36.297
<i>was on the verge of retirement.
Thank God.</i>

00:36.422 --> 00:38.761
<i>'Cause the high-five fake-out
was getting old.</i>

00:38.886 --> 00:40.360
<i>Really old.</i>

00:40.670 --> 00:43.377
<i>For six weeks,
I'd fantasized about two things.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:46.630
<i>My first fantasy involved
some intimate touching...</i>

00:47.647 --> 00:48.899
<i>of the elbow.</i>

00:50.231 --> 00:51.218
<i>And my second</i>

00:51.584 --> 00:54.471
<i>was centered on any and all parts
of Matty Mckibben.</i>

00:55.481 --> 00:57.481
<i>It wasn't like I was obsessing</i>

00:57.606 --> 00:59.121
<i>or that I'd counted the seven times</i>

00:59.246 --> 01:01.561
<i>I'd caught Matty looking at me
since school started.</i>

<i>Eight, if you counted the time
I wiped out on the quesadilla.</i>

01:16.659 --> 01:18.309
<i>And I did.
It counted.</i>

01:18.741 --> 01:21.846
<i>Okay, maybe I was obsessing.
A little.</i>

01:21.971 --> 01:23.912
<i>But it was keeping me from fixating
on something</i>

01:24.037 --> 01:25.502
<i>I was trying to forget.</i>

01:26.112 --> 01:28.812
<i>The evil, anonymous
care-frontation letter.</i>

01:29.220 --> 01:31.883
<i>It could bite me, and it always did.</i>

01:32.422 --> 01:35.013
<i>"Pull your head out of your ass
and stand out."</i>

01:35.351 --> 01:37.273
<i>Standing out was not a problem.</i>

01:37.398 --> 01:39.395
<i>Blending in
was the new name of the game,</i>

01:39.520 --> 01:40.814
<i>and I was...</i>

01:40.939 --> 01:43.306
- We're gonna be late!
- Ready!

01:43.472 --> 01:45.564
On the count of three.
One,

01:45.962 --> 01:46.773
two...

01:48.057 --> 01:48.859
Wait!

01:51.444 --> 01:54.322
Is there anything that we need to be
prepared for?

01:54.844 --> 01:57.075
- Like what?
- Deformity.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.413
I've heard that sometimes an arm
can shrink up to a tenth of its size.

02:01.579 --> 02:04.499
It'll still function,
it'll probably look normal in a year.

02:04.947 --> 02:06.484
- A year?
- You're scaring her.

02:06.609 --> 02:09.639
It's not like she's gonna have
a gimpy baby arm.

02:09.764 --> 02:10.839
Or is that possible?

02:11.005 --> 02:13.842
Worst-case scenario...
if it's unsightly,

02:14.008 --> 02:16.595
can we lipo the good arm
to match the bad one?

02:16.761 --> 02:19.890
- Mom, stop. You're wigging me out!
- I wanna know what all options...

02:20.056 --> 02:22.506
Mrs. Hamilton,
can we speak privately?

02:27.310 --> 02:28.857
Distract me.
Please.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.998
I brought you a gift!

02:31.123 --> 02:32.569
Are you batshizat?

02:32.735 --> 02:34.833
- Put that away.
- I am not aiding and abetting.

02:34.958 --> 02:37.949
It's for her pit.
That thing's gonna need some whacking.

02:38.354 --> 02:40.494
You're never gonna see any action,
like euro-trash.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.120
<i>Tamara still didn't know
I'd seen action when I took a ride</i>

02:43.245 --> 02:44.792
<i>on Matty's joystick at summer camp.</i>

02:44.917 --> 02:46.682
<i>I'd been dying to tell her, but...</i>

02:47.151 --> 02:48.543
<i>the timing wasn't right.</i>

02:50.294 --> 02:51.421
No more distractions.

03:00.892 --> 03:02.056
Sweetie...

03:03.015 --> 03:05.894
- Your cast is off.
- And your arm looks legit.

03:07.446 --> 03:09.481
- What the hell is this?
- Tackiness.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.400
Your pediatrician obviously needs
a lesson in style.

03:12.566 --> 03:13.985
As well as bedside manners.

03:14.151 --> 03:16.029
No, but why is elmo on my arm?

03:16.195 --> 03:18.740
You dislocated your shoulder
when you fell off the table.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.951
Don't tweak.
You have to wear it for a week.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.286
Although you might wanna upgrade
that shiznat,

03:23.701 --> 03:25.372
'cause it glows in the dark.

03:27.448 --> 03:28.449
<i>My life.</i>

03:29.083 --> 03:30.733
<i>Suicide Club présente :</i>

03:30.858 --> 03:32.659
- 1x02 <i>Knocker Nightmare</i> -

03:35.089 --> 03:37.946
Your mom was right.
It's very slimming to your bicep.

03:38.537 --> 03:40.318
I hear skinny slings are in.

03:40.443 --> 03:43.153
I could always add a little Ming bling
to make it more eye-catching.

03:43.278 --> 03:45.892
Thanks. But I've had enough eyes
on me for a lifetime.

03:48.442 --> 03:50.514
Maybe people would stop
staring at you

03:50.639 --> 03:53.441
if you could finish
the abortion your mom botched.

03:53.607 --> 03:55.478
We should've bitched that bitch out.

03:56.042 --> 03:59.115
What leg does she have to stand on
giving you a hard time?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.340
A thick one.

04:00.631 --> 04:03.076
- Let's not provoke the demon.
- I'm siding with Ming.

04:09.003 --> 04:10.004
<i>Look nine.</i>

04:10.374 --> 04:11.637
<i>If I was counting.</i>

04:11.762 --> 04:14.004
<i>Okay, I was counting.
Sue me.</i>

04:14.170 --> 04:14.963
More tape.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.632
More tape.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.555
Who are you stalking, creeper?

04:21.680 --> 04:22.682
Nobody.

04:23.448 --> 04:24.639
What were you saying?

04:24.805 --> 04:26.187
Who are you bringing tonight?

04:26.312 --> 04:28.184
- Who would I take, Jake?
- I don't know.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.811
Anyone here would go with you.

04:30.398 --> 04:33.823
Just please bring someone.
I don't wanna listen to Lissa bitch

04:33.948 --> 04:35.525
about how we're always a threesome.

04:35.691 --> 04:36.568
A threesome?

04:38.819 --> 04:40.363
The mystery girl from camp?

04:41.655 --> 04:43.491
And miss an opportunity
to annoy Lissa?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.994
What's the deal?
This chick have a dick or something?

04:46.160 --> 04:47.996
Did you ever think
that you embarrasses me?

04:48.162 --> 04:50.040
As your best friend, it's my job.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.037
If you wanna take our bromance
to the next level,

04:54.162 --> 04:56.546
you're gonna have to get me
drunk first, you little slut.

04:59.643 --> 05:01.551
Enough with the bum chum.

05:01.717 --> 05:03.595
No one likes gay porn before noon.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.261
What happened to your tree branch?

05:10.386 --> 05:11.770
It was trimmed.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.500
<i>It was a record.</i>

05:14.021 --> 05:16.107
<i>Two glances in less than 15 minutes.</i>

05:16.273 --> 05:18.139
<i>Matty was definitely
thinking about me.</i>

05:18.264 --> 05:20.676
<i>Hope for my fantasy
to become my reality</i>

05:20.801 --> 05:22.056
<i>had been reignited.</i>

05:22.181 --> 05:25.116
- <i>I was high on hope and...</i>
- It's rude to stare.

05:25.602 --> 05:27.786
- <i>Sadie's sweetness.</i>
- You're welcome.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.366
<i>The standard operating procedures
of high school,</i>

05:51.491 --> 05:54.312
<i>like PE, were once again
part of my routine.</i>

05:54.478 --> 05:56.439
<i>But the communal shower
couldn't bring me down.</i>

05:56.933 --> 05:57.941
<i>I was happily...</i>

05:59.944 --> 06:00.860
Sorry!

06:01.184 --> 06:02.434
<i>Back in action.</i>

06:05.992 --> 06:08.229
Everything is getting so big on me.

06:09.147 --> 06:11.180
Jake thinks I have
an eating disorder.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.990
How annoying is that?

06:13.774 --> 06:15.651
I don't know why
you're stressing on that

06:15.776 --> 06:18.753
when jacked-up Jenna
is all up in your boyfriend.

06:19.309 --> 06:21.909
Why would he check her out?
She's jacked up.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.051
Or do you think she's pretty?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.281
Of course I don't think she's pretty.

06:26.406 --> 06:29.264
But you're hovering around a seven,
I thought you might be worried.

06:29.941 --> 06:31.057
I'm a seven?

06:31.223 --> 06:34.185
Freaks like hamil-toe wield
the power of reckless abandon

06:34.351 --> 06:37.453
'cause they have nothing to lose,
especially with sex.

06:38.589 --> 06:40.639
Think she made a purity pledge?

06:42.274 --> 06:44.741
- What should I say to Jake?
- Nothing.

06:44.866 --> 06:46.781
Unless you wanna seem desperate.

06:46.947 --> 06:47.782
Personally,

06:47.948 --> 06:50.243
I would do something
to highlight her nastiness.

06:53.070 --> 06:54.820
Take a nudie shot of her.

07:02.973 --> 07:04.517
It's brillz.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.317
Now let's see
what everyone else thinks

07:07.442 --> 07:10.372
of these itty-bitty tities.

07:12.327 --> 07:15.362
It was amazing. No one even gawked
at me when I ran the mile.

07:15.487 --> 07:17.187
Your 15 minutes are officially up.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.439
At last.
You know, being invisible?

07:19.605 --> 07:22.243
Completely underrated.
I've really missed being ignored.

07:22.368 --> 07:25.278
I've missed having you focus on me,
'cause there's a crisis I can't ignore.

07:25.444 --> 07:26.494
It's major.

07:27.212 --> 07:30.492
Ricky Schwartz has been compulsively
stirring the party mix in his pants.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.999
- He's probably just adjusting.
- Is adjusting every 20 minutes normal?

07:34.124 --> 07:36.498
Or should I be worried
he has some sort of infestation?

07:36.664 --> 07:38.958
I am sure it's under
the radar of concern.

07:39.124 --> 07:40.581
Just like me.

07:40.706 --> 07:42.712
I'm on the road to recovery and...

07:42.878 --> 07:44.380
Everything is status quo.

07:44.546 --> 07:47.342
And you're no longer an outcast.

07:48.634 --> 07:51.888
That was just a little humor
to disarm you.

07:54.113 --> 07:55.213
Tough crowd.

07:55.637 --> 07:58.737
So how you feeling about the spike
in the teen suicide rate?

07:58.862 --> 08:00.063
Wrists feeling itchy?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.425
<i>Valerie still needed
to work on her sensitivity.</i>

08:02.550 --> 08:04.823
<i>But even her lack of tact
couldn't burst my bubble.</i>

08:04.948 --> 08:08.363
Actually, the suckage level
of my life is currently pretty low.

08:08.529 --> 08:09.937
In fact, I was thinking...

08:10.062 --> 08:12.075
Work it, girl!
I love your thinkin'.

08:12.717 --> 08:15.787
That, maybe we could
turn our weekly meetings

08:15.953 --> 08:17.914
into monthly meetings instead?

08:19.361 --> 08:21.251
Why do you think
your life doesn't suck?

08:22.501 --> 08:24.670
- It's because of these meetings.
- Or because I'm fine.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.715
So there's absolutely nothing
you're feeling bad about?

08:27.881 --> 08:29.259
- No.
- Course load?

08:29.425 --> 08:30.510
- No.
- Your body?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.761
- No.
- Not even your big teeth?

08:34.922 --> 08:35.923
No.

08:40.727 --> 08:41.855
What about...

08:42.230 --> 08:43.380
your breasts?

08:58.297 --> 09:01.161
I don't know what the big deal is.
There's not much to see.

09:05.377 --> 09:08.008
<i>Not only did my reality
still suck serious ass,</i>

09:08.507 --> 09:09.857
<i>but apparently...</i>

09:10.549 --> 09:12.096
<i>so did my fantasy.</i>

09:20.351 --> 09:24.763
I was paralyzed,
and the talk of the school again.

09:25.167 --> 09:26.780
But what I couldn't understand

09:26.905 --> 09:29.611
was why my bra-busters
were so fascinating.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.859
It's not so much that they're small.
It's that the diameter of the areola

09:32.984 --> 09:35.033
is not proportionate
to the size of the breast.

09:35.697 --> 09:39.746
No matter which way you look at them,
they always look back at <i>you.</i>

09:43.212 --> 09:45.126
I'm not a predator.
This is my job.

09:45.473 --> 09:47.295
<i>At least I was safe in the sanctuary,</i>

09:47.461 --> 09:48.922
<i>where only one rule applied...</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:51.016
<i>"Don't ask, don't tell."</i>

09:51.141 --> 09:53.551
<i>I really appreciated
that the regular misfits</i>

09:53.717 --> 09:56.679
didn't care about my knocker nightmare.
They were busy...

09:59.765 --> 10:01.017
Sizin' up my Hooters.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.913
Evidently the sanctuary
got good reception.

10:08.195 --> 10:09.705
We got your texts.

10:09.830 --> 10:13.029
- Where are you on the Britney meter?
- I might be Britney mid-head shave.

10:14.088 --> 10:17.690
- I caught Matty making fun of me.
- He is so "what" in whatever.

10:17.815 --> 10:20.306
Just be grateful you didn't hook up
with that jackhole.

10:21.034 --> 10:22.914
I am.
<i>I needed to tell Tamara</i>

10:23.080 --> 10:25.272
<i>that I had given Matty
the gift of my vag-I.</i>

10:25.397 --> 10:27.252
<i>But it still wasn't the right time.</i>

10:27.774 --> 10:30.299
You need to ignore the stares
and act like it doesn't bother you.

10:30.424 --> 10:33.716
T's right. The more you let it roll,
the less peeps will pay attention to you.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.266
<i>I was trying to chillax,
but the only thing I could let roll</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:42.881
<i>were my eyes.</i>

10:43.006 --> 10:46.938
My mother had conveniently forgotten
to pick me up or answer her phone.

10:47.344 --> 10:49.758
Do you think I love you
more than you love me?

10:50.649 --> 10:51.461
What?

10:51.586 --> 10:55.062
Well, sometimes I just think
that our love is not equal.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.785
Hey, Hamilton, do you need a ride?

11:02.142 --> 11:04.372
I'm cool with walking.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.452
No, come on.
We insist.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.500
Come on.

11:12.504 --> 11:14.132
Why can't she sit in the back?

11:14.298 --> 11:16.426
My amps are massive,
she might bump her arm.

11:20.304 --> 11:21.315
Hop in.

11:24.222 --> 11:25.018
Just...

11:25.184 --> 11:26.817
takes a minute to warm up.

11:29.138 --> 11:30.151
So...

11:31.584 --> 11:33.495
Look, I heard
what happened to you today.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.236
- How you holding up?
- I'm managing.

11:36.790 --> 11:40.033
Dude, I'm sorry.
It was a massive blowhard maneuver.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.909
- Really despicable.
- I'm over it.

11:42.075 --> 11:43.911
Turning the other cheek's
the right thing.

11:44.077 --> 11:45.621
No.
No, it's not.

11:48.113 --> 11:50.710
Jenna, you gotta find out
who did this and get 'em expelled.

11:51.557 --> 11:53.171
I bet the culprit already feels bad.

11:53.337 --> 11:56.049
You know, sometimes guilt
is punishment enough.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.468
Evil people don't feel guilty, Lissa.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.850
If the culprit had a conscience,
he would've never done it.

12:01.975 --> 12:04.432
<i>I was getting the distinct feeling
that the incident</i>

12:04.557 --> 12:07.013
<i>wasn't gonna die down anytime soon.</i>

12:07.527 --> 12:10.485
<i>But at least I'd find refuge
from all the pity at home.</i>

12:11.855 --> 12:13.450
Oh, honey.

12:13.575 --> 12:15.234
Ohh, God, I'm so sorry.

12:15.577 --> 12:16.465
It's okay.

12:16.590 --> 12:19.405
It's not like you haven't forgotten
to pick me up from school before.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.657
I know,
but considering what happened today...

12:22.118 --> 12:24.452
- Tamara called you?
- I saw it on my news feed.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.755
<i>Sad fact...</i>

12:25.880 --> 12:28.241
<i>My mom had more cyber friends
than I did.</i>

12:28.366 --> 12:31.292
But we are gonna turn that frown
upside down.

12:31.899 --> 12:33.211
I have a surprise.

12:34.672 --> 12:37.799
- What is that?
- It's you with a little enhancement.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.608
- A little?
- It's perfectly fine

12:39.733 --> 12:42.720
to have Bangladeshi boobies
these days, because now,

12:43.205 --> 12:45.223
we don't have to dream
about having a new chest.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.101
We can buy one.
I did.

12:49.709 --> 12:52.063
- When did you get a boob job?
- After high school,

12:52.229 --> 12:54.938
when I decided to forgo college
and raise you instead.

12:55.063 --> 12:57.275
<i>My mother was never subtle
about acknowledging</i>

12:57.400 --> 12:59.612
<i>that I was more of a burden
than a blessing.</i>

12:59.778 --> 13:02.093
Your nana and papa
let me use my college fund

13:02.218 --> 13:04.534
to graduate my breasts
to a new bra size.

13:04.903 --> 13:07.286
Say hello to Princeton and Harvard.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.320
You do realize
that I'm still in my formative years

13:10.445 --> 13:13.623
and what you're telling me could be
potentially psychologically scarring.

13:13.748 --> 13:14.919
Oh, please.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.964
I had to grow up without a cell phone.
That was scarring.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.258
Mom, when you were my age,
no one had a cell phone.

13:20.424 --> 13:21.946
I don't have to explain myself!

13:22.071 --> 13:24.053
As your mother,
it is my job to scar you.

13:24.515 --> 13:28.015
- And give me body dysmorphic disorder.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

13:35.355 --> 13:38.560
<i>My reality, without having
my fantasy to look forward to,</i>

13:38.685 --> 13:40.153
<i>was becoming too hard to bear.</i>

13:40.682 --> 13:42.480
<i>But I knew just what to do.</i>

13:46.994 --> 13:49.120
<i>I'd take control of the situation.</i>

13:49.286 --> 13:52.540
PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS
AND STAND OUT.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.174
Hey, everyone, have a good look!

14:03.133 --> 14:04.718
<i>In my fantasy scenario,</i>

14:04.843 --> 14:07.036
<i>I was gonna be
the bad-ass, the rebel.</i>

14:07.161 --> 14:09.140
<i>I'd be a legendary
sophomore rock star</i>

14:09.306 --> 14:11.225
<i>that no one would ever forget.</i>

14:11.433 --> 14:12.518
<i>But in reality...</i>

14:14.811 --> 14:17.565
<i>I had 30 more people
taking pictures of my tits.</i>

14:17.731 --> 14:20.276
<i>Jenna Hamilton,
please report to the office.</i>

14:23.007 --> 14:24.864
I know who sexted your tatas.

14:25.817 --> 14:28.012
I can't go down for this,
Jake'll break up with me.

14:28.137 --> 14:29.191
Calm down.

14:29.555 --> 14:32.530
The picture was on my phone.
I'll take the fall.

14:32.655 --> 14:35.808
What can they do to me anyway?
My dad built the planetarium.

14:36.488 --> 14:37.877
Skedaddz.

14:38.204 --> 14:39.045
I did it.

14:41.570 --> 14:43.334
Well, that's a good start.

14:43.459 --> 14:45.259
Now can you explain why you did it?

14:45.637 --> 14:47.113
It was an accident.

14:47.515 --> 14:48.846
I've seen the picture.

14:49.012 --> 14:51.483
And while the framing
was very amateurish,

14:51.608 --> 14:53.142
it was taken with intent.

14:55.105 --> 14:57.271
You're right.
I did do it on purpose.

14:57.674 --> 15:00.594
But it was a public
service announcement

15:01.066 --> 15:03.795
to illustrate what can happen
if you change in public.

15:04.093 --> 15:06.197
Sorry.
Can I go now, Valerie?

15:06.363 --> 15:07.490
It's "Ms. Marks".

15:07.656 --> 15:09.294
Okay, Valerie.

15:10.137 --> 15:13.199
Listen, Sadie, I can't let you go
until you acknowledge

15:13.324 --> 15:15.248
that what you did
was not very friendly.

15:15.595 --> 15:17.838
Jenna and I aren't friends.
No offense.

15:17.963 --> 15:18.918
None taken.

15:19.644 --> 15:21.879
She may not be offended, but I am.

15:22.045 --> 15:23.046
Why?

15:23.449 --> 15:24.507
We're friends.

15:25.772 --> 15:26.717
We are?

15:26.883 --> 15:28.344
Absolutely.

15:28.781 --> 15:30.346
And since we're friends,

15:30.512 --> 15:32.431
we probably shouldn't
waste each other's time.

15:32.829 --> 15:34.976
Not so fast, friend.

15:35.407 --> 15:38.396
I mean, what is
the most important friend rule?

15:38.562 --> 15:40.690
Friends don't let friends
wear mom jeans?

15:46.717 --> 15:50.157
Friends don't hurt
their friends' friends.

15:50.426 --> 15:52.034
Is that a threat?

15:52.200 --> 15:53.494
Are you kidding me?

15:53.660 --> 15:56.581
She is going easy on you.
Sexting a nude picture is illegal.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.249
- It is?
- Yes. I'm a minor.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.333
She's a minor.

15:59.757 --> 16:00.601
I get it.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.129
You two are in cahoots,
and this is a total setup.

16:03.524 --> 16:05.291
You know, Valerie, there are laws

16:05.416 --> 16:08.694
against this kind of emotional
manipulation by administrators.

16:09.066 --> 16:12.054
There's no emotional manipulation
going on here, is there, Jenna?

16:12.220 --> 16:14.079
There is,
but it's not coming from you.

16:14.204 --> 16:16.358
That was straight-up bullying.

16:16.483 --> 16:18.227
- Please don't stir the pot.
- And you.

16:18.393 --> 16:20.715
Right then your tone of voice
was very menacing.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.732
I am not feeling very safe here.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.068
- I don't want you to feel unsafe.
- Then I probably should go.

16:27.929 --> 16:29.759
But be advised, Val,

16:29.884 --> 16:32.264
people have gone to jail for less.

16:32.648 --> 16:34.118
So watch yourself.

16:35.175 --> 16:36.176
I will.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.664
I really appreciate that sage advice.

16:41.577 --> 16:42.823
You're welcome.

16:49.350 --> 16:51.218
I think that was productive.

16:54.573 --> 16:55.754
<i>For my early age,</i>

16:55.879 --> 16:59.310
<i>all girls are conditioned
to expect a romantic fantasy.</i>

16:59.766 --> 17:01.793
<i>Maybe I wasn't gonna be
one of those girls</i>

17:01.918 --> 17:03.696
<i>who gets the fantasy in high school.</i>

17:04.108 --> 17:05.814
<i>Maybe I'd have to wait.</i>

17:50.111 --> 17:53.864
Your mother told me what happened
at school today and what she advised,

17:54.030 --> 17:55.848
and I wanna be clear
about something...

17:55.973 --> 17:57.483
you are to ignore her.

17:57.608 --> 17:59.597
Been covering that base
for five years, dad.

17:59.722 --> 18:01.570
Now, she means well, but...

18:01.695 --> 18:04.542
you gotta remember that we were only two
years older than you when you were born.

18:04.708 --> 18:05.793
Sometimes I think

18:06.441 --> 18:09.672
the lines get blurred by her desire to
be your friend instead of your mother.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.340
Maybe we should get her glasses.

18:12.667 --> 18:13.467
So...

18:13.836 --> 18:17.096
You're not gonna do anything crazy
and you're not gonna hurt yourself?

18:18.255 --> 18:19.856
Dad, I don't hate myself.

18:20.416 --> 18:22.143
Just high school.
But it's okay.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.186
I know it's gonna end.
Eventually.

18:26.303 --> 18:28.919
You're never gonna be able to control
the things that happen to you,

18:29.044 --> 18:31.444
sweetheart, but you will be able
to control how you feel.

18:32.567 --> 18:34.530
Turn your lemons into lemonade.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.227
All right, smart-ass,

18:36.352 --> 18:37.397
sleep tight.

18:47.894 --> 18:48.692
Hello?

18:48.858 --> 18:50.796
Do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

18:51.680 --> 18:53.591
- Rip the band-aid off.
- <i>Okay.</i>

18:53.757 --> 18:56.177
Ricky Schwartz said your boobs
look like tiny torpedoes.

18:56.770 --> 18:59.180
- And the good news?
- He'd still rub one out to them.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.116
T.M.I.

19:00.241 --> 19:02.600
Since you won't let me read your blog,
what's the title tonight?

19:03.905 --> 19:05.978
"Overexposed and under-appreciated."

19:06.733 --> 19:08.814
Really, Jenna?
Now you're just being emo.

19:11.737 --> 19:13.961
- I forgot to tell you something.
- <i>What?</i>

19:15.194 --> 19:17.005
I had sex with Matty McKibben.

19:17.598 --> 19:19.533
How could you forget
to tell me you humped Matty?

19:19.927 --> 19:21.078
<i>When? Where?</i>

19:21.537 --> 19:23.866
<i>I need to know details
and I need to know them right now.</i>

19:23.991 --> 19:26.332
<i>Where did this happen? When?
You should have told me sooner.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:30.469
- I gotta call you back.
- <i>Hello? You better not hang up...</i>

19:35.939 --> 19:36.940
Hi.

19:37.683 --> 19:40.329
I took down all the photos
of you around school.

19:43.858 --> 19:45.473
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:51.269 --> 19:52.611
And I'm sorry...

19:53.540 --> 19:55.402
Just about what you heard me say.

19:55.568 --> 19:58.030
- It's okay. I'm over it.
- No, it is not okay.

19:59.797 --> 20:01.369
I need you to know that I...

20:01.652 --> 20:02.936
I wasn't making fun of you.

20:03.061 --> 20:06.121
I was just trying to deflect
all the attention away from your boobs.

20:07.981 --> 20:10.334
Which, incidentally,
are pretty awesome.

20:15.002 --> 20:16.564
You were being my hero.

20:19.114 --> 20:20.466
I was trying.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.018
www.u-sub.net
www.sous-titres.eu

20:28.184 --> 20:29.657

Padmé - STid - Tof

20:33.023 --> 20:34.149
Merci addic7ed

20:42.365 --> 20:44.531
Next on Awkward...
Marty invited me to a party.

20:44.656 --> 20:46.787
He's taking you public,
outing you as a couple.

20:46.953 --> 20:48.940
Are you and Matty together?

20:49.065 --> 20:52.293
Who the fuck invited you?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.378
Looks like Matty
invited a lot of people.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.213
You're having as much fun as I am?

20:56.379 --> 20:57.673
That's my anniversary.

20:59.632 --> 21:02.344
- You have to be home right away?
- I have a few hours to kill.
