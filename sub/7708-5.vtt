WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:04.536
- Now, you have everything, B?
- I think so.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.472
Yo! Everybody
up for "Jeopardy!"

00:06.474 --> 00:08.941
raise their hand
and give me a dollar.

00:08.943 --> 00:11.977
Sorry, ALF,
I'm jeapord-ied out.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.445
How about you, Kate?

00:13.447 --> 00:15.214
You must be over yesterday's

00:15.216 --> 00:17.483
trouncing by now.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.718
I'm taking Brian
to his scout meeting.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.022
But you haven't heard the
new categories I thought up.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.857
Martian tourist traps.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.692
Girls named Fred.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.361
Places you itch.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.963
We're leaving. Bye.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.401
Say, hey,
Willie Mayes.

00:35.403 --> 00:39.471
How about a fun-filled,
fast-paced game of "Jeopardy!"

00:39.473 --> 00:41.040
You cheat.

00:41.042 --> 00:43.742
William,
I'm appalled.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.877
I'm aghast.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.578
You're a cheater.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.747
I do not cheat.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.984
I just memorize
the answers in advance.

00:51.986 --> 00:55.154
Not like I have a lot
to do around here, you know.

00:55.156 --> 00:58.757
I'm going out to the
garage to work on my ham radio

00:58.759 --> 01:00.559
and while I'm gone,
I'd appreciate it

01:00.561 --> 01:03.162
If you did not put
any portion of this house

01:03.164 --> 01:08.934
in jeopardy, double jeopardy,
or final jeopardy.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.602
What are you worried
about, Willie?

01:10.604 --> 01:13.939
We hit your deductible
$10,000 ago.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.142
Goodbye.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.346
Now entering our studio

01:21.348 --> 01:22.881
a college freshman

01:22.883 --> 01:25.417
originally
from Los Angeles, California.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.187
Say hello
to Lynn Tanner.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.289
[imitates crowd cheering]

01:30.291 --> 01:33.425
ALF, two weeks
of that game is enough.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.127
I'm going to aerobics.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.596
Alright, look,
I'll give you an easy one.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.433
He's the 3'2" alien
from an exploded planet

01:41.435 --> 01:44.136
who's currently
bored to tears.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.238
ALF.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.907
Form of a question,
please!

01:48.909 --> 01:50.342
[door shuts]

01:51.579 --> 01:54.046
[theme music]

02:52.973 --> 02:55.340
[instrumental music]

03:01.482 --> 03:03.482
Need some help?

03:03.484 --> 03:06.585
No, I can do this
myself. Thanks.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.690
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.525
Do you mind?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.294
It's your radio.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.895
Or should I say,
your soon to be

03:16.897 --> 03:19.364
smoldering heap
of electrical debris.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.745
Alright, uh,
what I doing wrong here?

03:33.747 --> 03:38.750
Nope. Far be it for me to come
between a man and his hobby.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.654
Well, could you
far be it from me, please?

03:42.656 --> 03:45.190
But there's nothing good on TV.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.326
And I've read all the books
in the house.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.995
And I know it's on the top shelf
of every one of your closets.

03:51.832 --> 03:55.334
You were quite the letter-writer
in your day, Sugarlips.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.805
Stay out of my letters.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.175
What are you trying
to do here?

04:03.177 --> 04:05.577
Trying to upgrade
the auto monitor.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.745
Why?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.014
So I can talk
to Australia.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.583
Does the word "telephone"
ring a bell?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.785
Well, it would defeat
the purpose, ALF.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.355
The whole idea of a ham radio
is the challenge

04:16.357 --> 04:20.225
the real challenge,
man against machine.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.594
Good old American
know-how.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.298
Right. And you ain't going
to fix this no how.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.068
I'm retooling the monitor

04:30.070 --> 04:34.439
so that when I bump from
satellite to trans-Oceanic

04:34.441 --> 04:37.542
my Phelp switch doesn't
alter frequency.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.311
What, is that all?

04:39.313 --> 04:42.514
All? I've been working
on that for three months.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.219
There.
That'll do it.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.553
See ya.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.157
Oh.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.358
Yeah, right.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.061
Right.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.230
[static]

04:58.232 --> 05:00.065
(man on radio)
'Hello? Anyone there?'

05:02.436 --> 05:04.403
Hello?

05:04.405 --> 05:07.472
(man on radio)
'G'day, mate.
You're clear as a bell. Over.'

05:11.178 --> 05:12.944
Yo. What's up, scout?

05:12.946 --> 05:15.180
I'm working on
my bachelor living badge.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.448
Can I help?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.417
You know anything
about bachelor living?

05:18.419 --> 05:21.086
Well, I've eaten
cold pizza for breakfast

05:21.088 --> 05:23.522
and grown things
in the fridge.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.657
"The bachelor living
badge is for

05:25.659 --> 05:27.326
"basic homemaking skills

05:27.328 --> 05:29.928
for our fast-paced
and changing culture."

05:29.930 --> 05:33.165
My last requirement
is to prepare a balanced meal.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.434
Is that it?

05:35.436 --> 05:38.704
On Melmac, to get
a bachelor living badge

05:38.706 --> 05:40.505
they left you out in a field

05:40.507 --> 05:42.541
with only
twigs and bark

05:42.543 --> 05:45.877
and you had a week
to build a single's bar.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.947
I'm going to make
suggested menu number three.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.149
Turkey salad sandwiches,
broccoli spears

05:51.151 --> 05:52.884
and cheddar cheese cubes.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.786
Boring!

05:54.788 --> 05:57.856
It has something from each
of the four basic food groups.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.192
So does
Trevor's blue tie

06:00.194 --> 06:02.627
but I wouldn't want
to eat it for lunch.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.629
Are you going
to help me or not?

06:04.631 --> 06:06.665
Well, it's not
as challenging

06:06.667 --> 06:09.668
as building a mirror ball
out of dried leaves

06:09.670 --> 06:11.636
but it's better
than nothing.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.605
Here, you can take care
of the broccoli.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.477
¶ Dun-dun dun-dun
dun-dah! ¶

06:18.479 --> 06:20.746
¶ Dun-dun dun-dun
dun-dah! ¶¶

06:20.748 --> 06:23.081
There.
I took care of it.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.055
I don't know
about this.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.857
Well, actually, I do

06:31.859 --> 06:33.925
and I hate
the whole idea.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.194
But it's going
to make you feel great.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.063
I already feel great.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.598
Go ahead, feel me.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.069
You have no muscle tone.

06:44.071 --> 06:48.006
I'll have you know
my health club on Melmac

06:48.008 --> 06:52.077
once voted me
"bod of the month."

06:52.079 --> 06:53.712
You went
to a health club?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.948
Well, here you call it
a bakery.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.718
Come on.
No pain, no gain.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.187
[instrumental music]

07:03.624 --> 07:05.690
Come on, ALF.
Go for the burn!

07:05.692 --> 07:07.926
I'd rather go
for the donuts.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.131
Come on,
time for leg lifts.

07:15.769 --> 07:20.105
One, two, three, four, five.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.440
How does that feel, ALF?

07:21.442 --> 07:23.141
[ALF snoring]

07:23.143 --> 07:24.943
ALF!

07:39.793 --> 07:41.159
Hi.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.495
Hi.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.264
It's come
to this, Kate.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.233
What's that, ALF?

07:48.235 --> 07:52.971
I'm so bored, I'm interested
in what you're doing.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.806
What are you doing?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.341
Refinishing this bureau.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.513
I think, if you listen
very carefully

08:01.515 --> 08:05.183
You can actually hear
my interest wane.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.786
Just be careful.
That's wet.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.321
[scoffs]
You know, I think it's time

08:09.323 --> 08:11.323
for you to find a hobby.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.192
Why don't you
collect stamps?

08:14.194 --> 08:16.428
Great. I could think
about all the places

08:16.430 --> 08:18.763
they've been to
that I can't go.

08:18.765 --> 08:22.000
Perfect pastime for a shut-in.

08:22.002 --> 08:25.003
Well, what about, uh, yoga?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.172
It sounds fairly quiet.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.608
I was into yoga
on Melmac.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.343
Want to hear my mantra?

08:31.345 --> 08:32.844
Sure.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.347
Wow, I can really
cross my legs

08:35.349 --> 08:37.282
and put my feet
on top of my knees.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.451
Boy, am I relaxed and limber.
I'm so limber.

08:39.453 --> 08:40.819
Like, the limberest thing
you could think of.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.487
That's how limber
I am and--

08:42.489 --> 08:44.256
Maybe yoga's not
such a great idea.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.158
Now, what am I supposed to do?

08:47.160 --> 08:49.227
I'm not cutout for aerobics.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.830
Cubing cheese is no challenge.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.799
And I already fixed
Sugerlip's radio.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.403
Face it, Kate.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.639
I'm a man
without a purpose.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.674
Or a planet.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.877
Or a middle finger,
for that matter.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.412
Well, I'm sure you'll find

09:07.414 --> 09:09.848
Something interesting
to do..

09:09.850 --> 09:11.550
...eventually.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.052
That's what
I've been trying to..

09:18.659 --> 09:19.991
Stuck.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.461
I surmised.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.569
Ahh!

09:31.371 --> 09:32.637
Sorry.

09:36.109 --> 09:37.509
Furry handprint.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.645
I see it.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.682
Leaving now.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.083
Good idea.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.954
[instrumental music]

09:56.196 --> 10:00.065
Well, what's
your professional opinion?

10:00.067 --> 10:01.800
He's bored.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.602
But you don't think
there's any underlying

10:03.604 --> 10:05.604
psychological reason?

10:05.606 --> 10:07.606
Maybe boredom.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.140
That's it?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.042
Well, he's a very
intelligent being.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.311
I mean, he needs
to be challenged.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.879
He needs to be muzzled.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.149
He has the computer.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.552
I've bought him
dozens of books

10:20.554 --> 10:21.820
video tapes.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.655
He has plenty to do.
The problem is

10:23.657 --> 10:26.224
he wants to be in the
middle of whatever we're doing.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.260
It's easy to forget, you know,
that he's an adult

10:29.262 --> 10:30.929
and he wants to be
treated like one.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.564
So, what do we do?

10:32.566 --> 10:34.299
Well, you could, uh

10:34.301 --> 10:36.134
talk to him,
tell him your feelings

10:36.136 --> 10:38.503
ask for advice,
his opinion, and..

10:38.505 --> 10:40.805
Do it at dinner.
It'll work wonders.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.641
What if it doesn't?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.209
We'll have dessert.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.917
Oh, look,
it's the gravy train.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.686
Larry, you can sit
right there.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.188
Ah, thank you,
thank you, Kate.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.424
Wow, everything
looks delicious.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.929
Uh, well, uh, willie..

11:04.931 --> 11:07.432
How's life
been treating you?

11:07.434 --> 11:10.168
Um, well,
now you mention it

11:10.170 --> 11:11.703
there, uh..

11:11.705 --> 11:13.204
There is a guy at work..

11:13.206 --> 11:17.108
I-I've been having kind of
a hard time with.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.678
Oh, so tonight,
we're dining and whining?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.849
Uh, you want to tell us
about it, willie?

11:24.851 --> 11:29.154
Well, he's, uh, he's just
really competitive, you know?

11:29.156 --> 11:32.657
He's, um.. He's always trying
to beat my case load

11:32.659 --> 11:35.026
to get a raise
ahead of me

11:35.028 --> 11:37.462
get promoted before I do.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.864
I know that's not
what social work is all about

11:39.866 --> 11:43.802
but I just can't help
feeling pressured by this guy.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.537
What do you think, ALF?

11:47.841 --> 11:49.841
Huh?

11:49.843 --> 11:52.210
Well, there's this guy at work..

11:52.212 --> 11:54.479
I heard that part.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.048
Well..

11:57.050 --> 11:58.583
What do you think?

11:58.585 --> 12:00.018
You're asking me?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.854
You got a shrink
right here.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.156
No, I really value
your judgment.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.327
You what my what?

12:09.329 --> 12:12.063
Dad wants your opinion.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.865
Oh.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.501
Well, willie,
if you must be competitive

12:16.503 --> 12:18.670
why don't you just
compete with yourself?

12:18.672 --> 12:20.338
Not only will
you feel better

12:20.340 --> 12:22.373
you'll always win.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.876
That's exactly
what I would have said.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.211
Really?

12:26.213 --> 12:27.278
Really.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.747
You, a psychologist

12:28.749 --> 12:33.251
would have given the same advice
as I, a lay alien?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.686
That's right.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.623
Kate.. Uh, Kate?
Would you like some beets?

12:39.392 --> 12:40.725
Beets?

12:40.727 --> 12:42.427
Oh.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.129
Oh, yes. Uh-huh.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.064
Um..

12:46.066 --> 12:48.767
Speaking of work, you know

12:48.769 --> 12:49.968
I really love my job

12:49.970 --> 12:52.637
but whenever I'm there,
I feel like

12:52.639 --> 12:53.905
I'm neglecting the baby

12:53.907 --> 12:56.407
and whenever
I'm home here with eric

12:56.409 --> 12:58.910
I feel like I'm not pulling
my weight at work.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.645
How do you feel
about that, ALF?

13:02.716 --> 13:04.315
Me, again?

13:04.317 --> 13:05.884
Yeah, I, uh..

13:05.886 --> 13:09.821
I just wondered
how you thought about that.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.724
Well, did you go back to work
after Lynn was born?

13:12.726 --> 13:14.259
Yeah, I did.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.795
Well, see?
She turned out just fine.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.898
She's not a rooftop sniper
or anything.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.232
Thanks, ALF.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.268
That's exactly
what I would have said.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.904
Wow! Two for two!

13:25.906 --> 13:27.372
Who's next?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.478
Um, I have
a problem too.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.848
I don't like math.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.150
Neither do I.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.152
Thanks!
I feel better now.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.156
Hey, I'm on a roll!

13:45.158 --> 13:48.993
Anything I can help
you with, Lynndigo?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.029
Sure.

13:51.031 --> 13:54.465
Danny and I have been dating
for over a year now

13:54.467 --> 13:56.835
and I know he likes me,
but I just--

13:56.837 --> 13:59.804
'I still feel jealous
when he talks to other girls.'

13:59.806 --> 14:02.874
I wish I knew what
to do about that.

14:02.876 --> 14:06.344
Well, my advice would be to talk
it over with Danny.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.946
Let him know how you feel

14:07.948 --> 14:10.381
and I'm sure you'll be able
to work things out.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.016
You with me on this, lar?

14:12.018 --> 14:14.385
Oh, that's exactly
what I would have said.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.688
Hey, this is great!

14:16.690 --> 14:19.023
How much you get paid
for this kind of thing?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.191
What kind of thing?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.827
This advice shtick.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.996
Well, actually,
I get paid quite a lot.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.698
Why do you ask?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.400
Because I've found
my true calling..

14:29.402 --> 14:32.904
I'm going to be a shrink.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.973
How does that make you feel?

whistles in the dark

14:58.899 --> 15:02.033

But he does not see any the more
clearly for doing so."

15:07.207 --> 15:09.107
I beg your pardon?

15:09.109 --> 15:10.942
Freud said that.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.443
You were clinking.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.345
Clinking?

15:14.347 --> 15:15.546
You feel
you haven't made

15:15.548 --> 15:17.515
a significant mark
on the world

15:17.517 --> 15:18.950
so you compensate

15:18.952 --> 15:21.719
by unconsciously
asserting your presence

15:21.721 --> 15:24.322
in situations
where you feel anonymous.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.227
What are you reading?

15:29.229 --> 15:32.597
It's a therapy book.
Larry loaned it to me.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.966
I'm a shrink now, remember?

15:34.968 --> 15:36.968
Oh, right.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.903
Willie, if this
interests ALF

15:38.905 --> 15:41.039
we should be supportive.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.707
And very grateful.

15:43.810 --> 15:44.876
Right.

15:44.878 --> 15:47.045
Uh, maybe you've got
a point.

15:47.047 --> 15:51.549
I'll, uh.. In the future,
I'll refrain from clinking.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.785
You'll be
the better for it.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.087
These eggs are
a little bit dry.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.890
I'm sorry.
I always do that.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.992
Kate, Kate, Kate.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.561
You're expanding
one tiny failure

16:03.563 --> 16:06.431
into a self-defeating
behavior pattern.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.832
What?

16:07.834 --> 16:10.268
It's called
overgeneralization.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.271
You convince yourself that you
can never cook eggs right

16:13.273 --> 16:15.807
and then you can't
cook eggs right.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.842
Oh, I have a headache.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.177
Morning.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.611
Morning, Brian.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.480
Hey, B.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.415
Have you ever dreamed
you were being chased

16:24.417 --> 16:26.584
by a giant cheese log?

16:26.586 --> 16:28.186
No.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.189
Then I'll only need
to see you five times a week.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.930
[instrumental music]

16:41.167 --> 16:42.533
Huh!

16:42.535 --> 16:44.268
It says in this article
that babies sometimes

16:44.270 --> 16:45.837
remember things
that happened when

16:45.839 --> 16:47.972
they were still
in the womb.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.874
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.776
I wonder if eric
will remember

16:51.778 --> 16:54.345
how things were around here
before he was born.

16:56.883 --> 16:59.450
Carl Jung was
a big weenie head.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.922
With any luck, he'll forget his
first five years entirely.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.393
I'm preparing a paper

17:08.395 --> 17:11.396
for the American
Psychological Association

17:11.398 --> 17:15.967
that proves Jung's theorems
were based on faulty logic

17:15.969 --> 17:18.503
and misinterpreted data.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.706
How do you spell
"Na-na na-na-na?"

17:24.210 --> 17:25.743
ALF, it's not that
we don't appreciate

17:25.745 --> 17:29.180
your attempts to
overanalyze every..

17:29.182 --> 17:33.484
To, uh, help us with
our problems, but--

17:33.486 --> 17:35.219
Speaking of problems

17:35.221 --> 17:37.321
we've got to do something
about Brian.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.324
What's wrong with Brian?

17:40.326 --> 17:41.759
[sucks teeth]

17:44.197 --> 17:46.431
He's been experiencing
a lot of negative stroking

17:46.433 --> 17:48.166
from Kate lately

17:48.168 --> 17:50.835
and it's affecting
his sense of okayness.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.005
Alright. Okay.
This has gone far enough.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.173
Now, now, honey.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.607
No, no, it's alright.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.709
It's good to ventilate.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.679
I am not ventilating.
I am talking.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.281
And I resent the implication

18:03.283 --> 18:06.217
that I am having a negative
effect on my son's okayness.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.618
Furthermore--

18:07.620 --> 18:09.220
How long have you had
this persecution complex?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.888
ALF!

18:10.890 --> 18:12.690
I was talking to your wife.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.925
Now, we ought
to take a look

18:13.927 --> 18:15.927
at your ego boundaries,
willie.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.528
Oh, I give up, I give up.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.298
You're relinquishing
your resistance. Good.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.367
Now we can make
some real progress.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.636
And you are spouting a lot

18:25.638 --> 18:27.872
of psychological clichés

18:27.874 --> 18:29.941
you don't even understand.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.710
Why so hostile, willie?

18:32.712 --> 18:35.246
I'm okay. You're okay.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.448
This must stop!

18:37.450 --> 18:40.084
That's right,

18:40.086 --> 18:43.754
Let it fly!
Then I'll..

18:43.756 --> 18:48.659
You cannot keep aggravating
people like this.

completely carried away

19:04.978 --> 19:07.145

19:07.147 --> 19:08.779
Oh, you know ALF,
he gets carried away

19:08.781 --> 19:10.181
with everything he does.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.617
What motivated you
to let it go this far?

19:12.619 --> 19:16.120
Oh, stop it, Larry. I've
had enough of this all week.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.622
Just fix it.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.023
Yeah, you know
what they say..

19:19.025 --> 19:21.425
A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.

19:21.427 --> 19:25.463
In ALF's hands, foam rubber
is a dangerous thing.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.964
Do you think you can help?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.699
Trust me.
I'm a professional.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.937
The last time
someone said that to me

19:32.939 --> 19:34.839
I ended up
with purple hair.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.710
Dinner smells great, mom.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.679
And you worked in all
the food groups, too.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.181
Well, I had planned
to serve steaks tonight

19:43.183 --> 19:44.515
But I forgot to take them out
of the freezer

19:44.517 --> 19:45.716
so at the last minute--

19:45.718 --> 19:47.652
Kate, Kate, Kate.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.621
I think we're overcompensating,
aren't we?

19:50.623 --> 19:52.156
Excuse me?

19:52.158 --> 19:54.192
You're apologizing
for the food

19:54.194 --> 19:55.693
in order to disguise
your feelings

19:55.695 --> 19:57.795
of insecurity around Larry.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.497
Right, lar?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.465
No, she's not
doing that at all.

20:01.467 --> 20:05.136
You're projecting your feelings
about me onto Kate.

20:05.138 --> 20:08.005
Are you challenging
my autonomy?

20:08.007 --> 20:10.208
Well, you're the one
that set yourself up

20:10.210 --> 20:12.410
as a resident
psychology expert.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.246
I mean, it's only natural
that you'd be threatened by me.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.014
Who's threatened?

20:17.016 --> 20:20.151
I'm coming from
a very secure place.

20:20.153 --> 20:23.688
Ah, I'm picking up
some hostilities here.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.356
Can't we just have
a simple dialogue

20:25.358 --> 20:27.658
between our
adult ego states?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.660
Well, you're discounting
an emotion

20:29.662 --> 20:31.729
you're not prepared to confront.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.431
And you're judging
my reactions

20:33.433 --> 20:36.400
with an unfair cultural bias.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.569
You know, I think this is just
another temporary obsession

20:38.571 --> 20:40.571
to draw attention to yourself.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.440
Hey!

20:42.442 --> 20:45.376
That wasn't nice.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.378
It's not so much fun
being on the receiving end

20:47.380 --> 20:49.013

20:49.015 --> 20:50.448
Aw, come on.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.083
I don't sound like him.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.620
Do I?

20:55.622 --> 20:57.154
- Yep.
- Sure do.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.191
Wow.

21:00.193 --> 21:01.759
You're really annoying.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.529
Well, I've been
at it a long time.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.635
Now I know what Jung meant
when he said

21:10.637 --> 21:12.603
"The growth of the mind

21:12.605 --> 21:16.040
"is the widening of
the range of consciousness

21:16.042 --> 21:19.277
"and each step forward
has been a most painful

21:19.279 --> 21:22.213
