WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:08.841
Coming up to 50 feet.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.551
Roger that.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.970
We're light on fuel.
Two minutes to bingo.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.934
Come on, Fisher,
we got places to go, people to see.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.018
Working on it!

00:19.144 --> 00:21.979
So I've heard.
What's taking so long?

00:27.403 --> 00:29.237
Let go of the suitcase!

00:35.327 --> 00:36.828
Let go of the suitcase!

00:36.954 --> 00:38.538
You're gonna have
to hold on to me!

00:41.583 --> 00:44.043
Sir, whatever it is,
it's not worth it!

00:44.962 --> 00:46.295
We're at bingo fuel, sir.

00:46.422 --> 00:47.922
You hear that, Fisher?
Bingo!

00:48.424 --> 00:50.216
Either reel him in
or we're leaving them both here!

00:50.342 --> 00:51.801
Okay, sir.

01:02.438 --> 01:04.355
Ditch the damn luggage!

02:09.671 --> 02:11.005
Marina.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.425
Marina! Marina!

02:26.271 --> 02:28.815
Tell him if he was so worried
about his wife's clothes,

02:29.274 --> 02:30.775
he should have
stayed in Cuba!

02:34.863 --> 02:37.824
He says it wasn't her clothes,
it was her medical records.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.117
Says she's sick
and needs to go home.

02:41.787 --> 02:45.873
No home, House!
I need to see Dr. House!

03:55.068 --> 03:56.861
You don't answer
your phone anymore.

03:56.987 --> 03:59.780
I'm world-famous now.
Press won't leave me alone.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.865
- It's Cuddy.
- I know.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.366
If it was the press,
I'd be answering.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.869
And since you're not
taking her calls, I am.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.829
Your patient's been
waiting for hours.

04:06.955 --> 04:07.830
She didn't book
an appointment.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.916
No, she risked her life.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.375
If you don't
reach terra firma,

04:11.501 --> 04:12.543
you don't get
any milk or honey.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.463
The woman has 10
different things wrong with her,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.549
including pains
all over her body.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.802
Admittedly,
not as interesting

04:21.929 --> 04:24.055
as staring uselessly
at Foreman.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.767
You know why I find
a goodbye party fascinating?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.853
I think it's kind of insulting to
celebrate when someone leaves you.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.022
- What are you gonna do to keep him?
- Nothing.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.608
He really is gonna leave.
You know that, right?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.944
- Yeah.
- So what are you gonna do?

04:38.070 --> 04:39.070
Nothing I can do.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.656
He doesn't want more money,
better working conditions,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.866
doesn't even
want a better job.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.534
He wants to not be me.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.578
Because he thinks
you're a cold-hearted bastard

04:47.704 --> 04:49.664
without any regard
for anyone but yourself.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.748
He's right.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.834
You need to show him
that you really do care.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.127
Don't!

04:55.587 --> 04:59.382
Foreman's not the only
chocolate-covered cherry in the box.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.135
House, you play a guitar
you got in ninth grade.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.095
Eighth.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.514
You're living in
the same apartment for 15 years,

05:06.640 --> 05:09.517
you drive a 10 year-old car,
you are not good with change.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.936
That used to be true,
but I changed.

05:12.437 --> 05:16.899
He's not afraid to be you, he's afraid
to be who he thinks you are.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.657
Rheumatic fever
would explain the skin rash.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.200
But not the double
vision or bloody urine.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.660
They were lost
at sea for three days.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.370
Severe dehydration
causes kidney problems.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.913
And the double vision?

05:31.415 --> 05:33.290
Concussion
during the shipwreck.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.752
It all fits as long as each symptom
started when you think it started.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.382
This would be a lot easier
if we had her medical records.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.634
Any of you
certified deep-sea divers?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.845
She's from a dirt-poor
country in the tropics.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.597
Infectious disease and parasites
are the most likely cause

05:48.724 --> 05:52.226
of unexplained pain, fever and skin
rash. We might as well start there.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.395
If there's one thing
Castro knows,

05:54.521 --> 05:56.564
it's how to look
great in green.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.982
And if there are two
things Castro knows,

05:58.108 --> 06:00.901
it's how to look great
in green and train doctors.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.528
Even without
the medical records,

06:02.654 --> 06:04.697
we can assume she was
drowned in antibiotics

06:04.823 --> 06:06.866
before she risked
drowning to see me.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.701
So what doesn't Castro know?

06:08.827 --> 06:11.120
How to lay his hands on
high-tech scanning equipment.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.123
Pain, double vision
point us toward the head.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.626
Cameron, get an MRI. See what's cooking
in the old cabeza.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.880
Chase,
check out the husband.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.548
Why? He hasn't
complained of any pain.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.801
Basic math. Take all of her symptoms,
subtract his sea symptoms,

06:25.927 --> 06:28.179
the remainder equals
her original symptoms.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.490
Are you in any pain?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.742
No, I'm just sunburned.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.120
Any blurred vision?

06:53.663 --> 06:54.914
No.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.125
So my wife,
she is with Dr. House?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.795
She's with another doctor
who is part of Dr. House's team.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.005
No, she's supposed to
see Dr. House.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.507
We have permission.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.509
That's the way it
works with Dr. House.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.177
I came 1,000 miles
to see him!

07:08.303 --> 07:09.929
He doesn't care.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.807
I'm sorry,
but that's who he is,

07:12.933 --> 07:15.559
that's who you
risked your life to see.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.855
And you made
the right choice.

07:22.734 --> 07:23.818
Any other metal?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.613
Must have been
difficult on the boat.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.534
When the storm came,
yes, very much.

07:31.743 --> 07:34.537
I pray while my husband,
he...

07:37.749 --> 07:39.041
With the paddles?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.668
You were on a boat
without a motor?

07:40.794 --> 07:43.212
No, no,
we start with a motor,

07:43.338 --> 07:45.422
but it break on
the first night.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.511
My husband,
he can fix anything.

07:51.221 --> 07:55.766
A washing machine,
a car, a computer.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.186
But that is stupid motor.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.439
And me.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.608
These two he cannot fix.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.485
He got you to us.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.070
He never gave up.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.448
No matter what happen,

08:11.950 --> 08:15.536
he kept saying to me,
"Don't worry,

08:17.539 --> 08:19.165
"we will make it.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.250
"I'll take care of you."

08:24.379 --> 08:25.629
That's Esteban.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.633
He refuses to worry or pray.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.929
He believe
if you don't have one,

08:34.055 --> 08:35.764
that you don't
need the other.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.479
Husband has a pulled
muscle in his shoulder,

08:42.606 --> 08:44.857
but no other pains
or double vision.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.944
He does have a fever, fungal rash,
cough, and elevated bilirubin.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.030
Foreman's not going anywhere.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.451
- He said that to you?
- He doesn't really wanna leave.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.827
And you don't
really wanna let him.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.621
You'll cave, just like
you did with Cameron.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.789
Foreman's not
as easy as Cameron.

09:00.916 --> 09:02.499
But, of course, who is?

09:04.252 --> 09:05.169
I'm in the room.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.172
He may not want a date,
but he does want something.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.007
Well, maybe it's
something I can't offer.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.217
Then you'll just lie.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.635
- He'd see through it.
- Maybe.

09:12.761 --> 09:14.845
Or maybe he'll just see
what he wants to see.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.433
She has MS.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.893
Explains the pain, fatigue,

09:21.019 --> 09:22.645
double vision,
kidney problems.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.230
The kidney problems
aren't connected.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.148
Her husband
has the same issues.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.733
It is possible for
two people to have

09:27.859 --> 09:29.485
the same symptom
for two different reasons.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.736
If we're gonna
take that approach,

09:30.862 --> 09:31.695
then we may as
well just throw out

09:31.821 --> 09:33.697
everything we got
from the husband and start over.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.242
We could do that, or we could do
something productive.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.993
Start her on
Interferon for the MS,

09:38.119 --> 09:39.620
see if she improves.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.083
I do like being productive.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.044
Well done. Do it.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.968
"Well done"? Is that what you think
he wants, a pat on the head?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.719
Go do your job.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.274
She does not have MS.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.567
I know it's not a pleasant
diagnosis to hear...

10:10.694 --> 10:13.237
But, no! The doctors in Cuba
would have found MS.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.032
What's that?

10:18.535 --> 10:21.328
It's all right.
Her pulse ox just came off.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.622
Marina, you can't...

10:23.748 --> 10:24.665
But it hurts.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.874
Her pain is getting worse!

10:26.001 --> 10:28.627
Your treatment isn't working
because it's not MS.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.920
Does this hurt?

10:34.801 --> 10:40.848
Wow! Well, either Foreman's way
stronger than he thinks he is or...

10:43.184 --> 10:44.768
Seriously. Or?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.146
She's too young for
osteoporosis that severe.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.231
And too old for
osteogenesis imperfecta.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.650
- Which leaves bone cancer.
- Cancer's a long shot.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.487
Why? Because metastatic
tumors don't explain the abnormal MRI,

10:55.613 --> 10:57.948
kidney damage, cotton mouth,
double vision.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.116
Oh, wait, they do!

10:59.242 --> 11:00.492
Infection could
do all that, too.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.702
It's not an infection.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.079
Because you know the nonexistent
medical records confirm

11:04.205 --> 11:07.124
that the brilliant doctors
in Cuba treated her for infection,

11:07.250 --> 11:09.626
or because you're trying to
kiss up to Foreman?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.629
Because an infection
would cause a fever,

11:12.756 --> 11:14.506
and the brilliant doctors
who work in my office

11:14.632 --> 11:16.717
have already crossed that off the list
because the husband...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.719
You're the one who said
it's possible for two people

11:18.845 --> 11:20.721
to have the same symptom
for two different reasons.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.681
And you're the one
who said if we do that,

11:22.807 --> 11:24.683
we might as well throw out everything
we got from the husband.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.102
Right, and then you said we should
do something productive

11:27.228 --> 11:28.812
like breaking her arm?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.189
Foreman didn't break her arm.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.858
- Of course he didn't.
- Cancer did.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.778
Put her in a PET scan,
see what else it's breaking.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.407
This isn't gonna work!
He's not a moron!

11:40.533 --> 11:42.826
You can't just agree with
everything he says for two days

11:42.952 --> 11:46.705
and hope he forgets the last three years
and how much he hates you!

11:47.957 --> 11:49.249
Anything else?

11:52.837 --> 11:55.589
When you get the results
of the PET scan, let me know.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.159
I don't really care
if Foreman stays or goes, but...

12:24.285 --> 12:25.327
You're fired.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.710
What,
because I yelled at you?

12:33.837 --> 12:36.213
Because you've
been here the longest,

12:36.339 --> 12:39.800
learned all you can or
you haven't learned anything at all.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.720
Either way,
it's time for a change.

12:52.522 --> 12:53.856
Fine.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.124
No tumors in her arm.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.835
Synovial membrane
is working fine.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.421
No hot spots,
no bone cancer.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.715
Maybe we should be
looking for something else.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.595
Is it raining out?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.805
- House fired me.
- What?

13:26.931 --> 13:28.640
Because you yelled at him?

13:28.766 --> 13:31.685
"Time for a change"
was the official explanation.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.353
It makes no sense.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.855
Since when does
House make sense?

13:34.981 --> 13:35.981
He always makes sense.

13:36.107 --> 13:37.065
He's angry.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.734
Yes, it's all about you,
Foreman.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.903
He's upset you're leaving,
so he fires Chase.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.738
Excuse me.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.908
On the humerus,
she's got a hot spot.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.026
Why'd you fire Chase?

14:21.152 --> 14:22.152
Sure thing.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.029
First you tell me
the results of the PET scan.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.280
Did you fire him for me?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.615
Would you stay if I did?

14:26.741 --> 14:27.908
You asked him to fire Chase?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.451
- No!
- Yes!

14:29.577 --> 14:30.911
You're frustrated with Foreman

14:31.037 --> 14:32.788
so you lash out,
kick the dog?

14:32.914 --> 14:35.582
He's not gone five minutes
and the name-calling starts.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.376
What's on the PET scan?

14:37.502 --> 14:38.460
Why'd you fire Chase?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.003
Do you know
what's on the PET scan?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.338
You two, out.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.675
Wait!
What's on the PET scan?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.843
You can't dump
your entire department

14:46.970 --> 14:49.388
just because you don't know
how to deal with an issue.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.640
Yes,
they are all irreplaceable.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.725
If only in this country
we'd figure out a way

14:53.851 --> 14:55.852
to somehow teach people
to interpret PET scans.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.230
What the hell's wrong with you?
You fired Chase?

14:58.356 --> 15:00.274
I don't suppose you know
what's on my patient's PET scan.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.651
I told you to show Foreman
you have a heart.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.486
How does that translate
into you being a bastard?

15:04.612 --> 15:05.445
So that's a no.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.948
Pick up the phone
and tell Chase you made a mistake.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.783
Un-fire him.

15:14.289 --> 15:18.458
Chase, if you know what's on
the PET scan, call me back.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.627
Cut the crap.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.045
Chase is a good doctor.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.797
Sorry,
you're in the wrong room.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.300
My name on the door,
my team, my decisions.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.760
My building,
my floor, my people.

15:30.847 --> 15:33.015
Hold that reprimand. House.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.768
Dr. Chase! How are you?

15:39.188 --> 15:43.275
Thank you.
You are indispensable.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.945
You're still fired. Sorry.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.948
Wow, that was awkward.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.492
PET scan revealed
a blood clot in my patient's arm.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.411
Which means goodbye.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.079
Still got two people
working for me,

15:56.205 --> 15:57.914
gotta get one of them
to do my job.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.545
A clot means a heart problem.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.881
We have to do
an emergency angiogram.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.299
But you're not sure
it's a blood clot?

16:07.425 --> 16:10.427
PET scan can't determine
that with certainty.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.888
So you have no better idea what's wrong
with her than when we first got here?

16:13.014 --> 16:15.682
- We've ruled out MS.
- I told you it wasn't MS.

16:15.808 --> 16:16.850
Where is Dr. House?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.352
Dr. House has
left for the night.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.854
He'll be here in the morning
to review the results,

16:20.980 --> 16:23.065
if you sign the consent.

16:29.322 --> 16:34.326
But, you know,
you could call him at home.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.538
He doesn't always pick up,
so keep calling.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.376
Thank you.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.635
Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez again.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.846
As soon as you get home,
it's very important you call me.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.774
Hello, yes, Dr. House,
it's Esteban Hernandez.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.360
As soon as you get home,
if you can please call me?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.616
The catheter is in
her femoral artery.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.118
Why are you telling me that?

17:16.411 --> 17:17.828
Because you're assisting.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.163
Do I look like I'm assisting?

17:20.289 --> 17:23.083
I had nothing to do
with Chase's termination.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.584
Is everything okay?

17:24.961 --> 17:26.837
You're doing fine, Marina.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.172
The dye will take a minute
to work its way through your system.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.216
Why would you tell House
you're leaving because he's a jerk?

17:31.342 --> 17:32.801
Because it's the truth.

17:34.345 --> 17:37.013
Did you give
an angry Cuban my home number?

17:37.140 --> 17:38.181
Why would you do that?

17:38.307 --> 17:39.975
You're not turning into House,
you're worse than him.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.227
Let me get this straight.
Instead of picking up the phone

17:42.353 --> 17:44.771
and talking to
a patient for five minutes,

17:44.897 --> 17:47.441
you gave up on sleep
and drove in here.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.859
My chest!

17:50.319 --> 17:51.820
She's in V-Tach.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.113
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

17:53.239 --> 17:55.407
Must have hit something.
You nick an artery?

17:56.451 --> 17:57.909
She has no pulse.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.036
It hurts.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.668
She has no pulse,
but she's talking.

18:07.503 --> 18:11.840
Cough! Cough again!
Keep coughing!

18:11.966 --> 18:13.592
It'll push blood into your head,
keep you conscious.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.218
Push one
milligram Epinephrine.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.805
Will that help?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.725
No. But it is amazingly cool.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.144
We need to get her on bypass!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.312
We need to keep her here.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.772
If this was a clot,
the force of bypass

18:26.898 --> 18:28.356
will blow it into
her brain, kill her.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.775
If we continue CPR,
she'll lose blood flow,

18:29.901 --> 18:30.901
which will
cause brain damage.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.694
What caused
the heart to stop?

18:32.820 --> 18:34.196
Let's assume
it wasn't human error.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.822
I didn't nick an artery,
it just stopped.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.907
I said let's assume.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.867
The only other option
is electrical instability.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.744
No ST segment changes.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.746
We need to tell the husband.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.123
Tell him what?
We have no idea what happened.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.127
House?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.630
Keep going until
I figure this out.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.758
House!

18:59.806 --> 19:01.056
Jeez.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.893
At 47, I hope my colon looks
better than this guy's.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.145
Isolating
the first transverse...

19:07.939 --> 19:10.607
Help! I'm trapped
inside a monitor!

19:15.655 --> 19:16.905
Not a good time, House.

19:17.031 --> 19:20.325
My patient lost her heartbeat during
routine cardiac catheterization, so...

19:20.743 --> 19:22.953
- Human error.
- It's not human error.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.162
Electrical instability?

19:24.288 --> 19:26.373
Pre-procedure EKG was normal,
no syncope.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.541
Ischemia?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.459
Foreman said no
STsegment changes.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.294
Human error is
the only other possible...

19:31.420 --> 19:32.754
It's not human error.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.714
Of course it's human error!

19:34.841 --> 19:36.424
You don't want Foreman
to have made a mistake

19:36.551 --> 19:37.676
because then
you'd have to mock him.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.136
And that would put a crimp
in your brilliant plan of keeping him

19:40.263 --> 19:42.347
by having a breakdown
and firing Chase.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.558
Did you just
spit on the monitor?

19:44.809 --> 19:46.393
You know I can't see you.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.813
Human error would not
explain her symptoms.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.816
You mean her heart stopping?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.526
I mean her foot pain,
her back pain.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.194
House! I'm busy!
You have a team,

19:56.320 --> 19:57.821
run your differential
with them.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.156
Foreman and Cameron
are doing CPR.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.908
Then you shouldn't
have fired Chase.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.661
Change is fun, huh?

20:07.999 --> 20:11.960
- Five, six, seven, eight!
- Go!

20:13.170 --> 20:14.254
Someone's gotta
talk to the husband.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.464
He thought this whole thing
was gonna last 45 minutes!

20:16.591 --> 20:18.425
A half hour more of this,
nothing to talk about,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.927
we won't be able to bring her back.
We gotta get her on bypass.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.846
House still isn't
answering his phone.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.306
You, get in here.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.600
Go!

20:29.186 --> 20:32.230
Excuse me, my wife was supposed
to be back an hour ago...

20:32.440 --> 20:34.649
As soon as we know anything,
we'll call you.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.192
Thank you.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.950
Human Behavior finals
will also get into

20:44.076 --> 20:47.078
clinical presentations
of mania,

20:47.788 --> 20:50.916
and we'll touch on
Stanislas Dehaene's PET scans.

20:51.042 --> 20:53.293
Excuse me, Professor.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.337
House, when we're
done with our rounds...

20:55.463 --> 20:56.922
My patient
has no heartbeat.

20:57.048 --> 21:00.508
Stopped when we inserted a catheter
during a routine angiogram.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.011
Anyone tells me
why her heart stopped

21:03.137 --> 21:05.305
gets an A in
Dr. Cuddy's class.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.515
Anyone?

21:08.142 --> 21:08.975
Human error?

21:09.101 --> 21:11.227
Yeah. I'm polling
first-year medical students

21:11.354 --> 21:12.812
because I hadn't
considered human error.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.230
Marfan Syndrome?

21:14.357 --> 21:16.608
Structural abnormalities
would show up on the echo.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.902
You get a C. Yeah?

21:19.028 --> 21:19.903
Botox injections.

21:20.029 --> 21:20.862
F.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.032
If the injection was tainted
with live botulism, it'd fit.

21:24.533 --> 21:25.784
B-plus.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.036
Unfortunately, she missed
her last Botox appointment

21:28.162 --> 21:30.538
due to a boating accident,
but send me your résumé.

21:30.665 --> 21:31.957
House, time's up.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.834
Good Lord,
you smell like musk ox.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.545
Either our patient goes on bypass,
or I call time of death.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.422
Your patient isn't
already on bypass?

21:39.548 --> 21:40.799
I was worried about a clot.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.175
- How long?
- Three hours.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.177
House. Bypass, now!

22:00.027 --> 22:01.528
Clear the hall!

22:01.654 --> 22:02.988
Out of the way, please!

22:03.114 --> 22:04.489
Let's go! Excuse us!

22:04.949 --> 22:07.784
Dr. Foreman! My wife!
What has happened?

22:07.910 --> 22:09.619
Her heart stopped.
We have to get her on bypass.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.996
He needs to wait outside.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.247
Got it?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.306
Dr. House.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.766
You can vacuum later.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.020
I am not the janitor,
I am Esteban Hernandez.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.604
What happened to my wife?

22:37.732 --> 22:39.524
Her heart stopped.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.234
Why did her heart stop?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.944
Well, if I knew that,
I'd be coming to you.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.446
Tell me where you take her.

22:44.572 --> 22:45.739
Tell me
what is happen to her?

22:45.865 --> 22:49.034
"Happening."
It's a present participle.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.536
Not a particularly
interesting form of speech.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.329
Kind of like
this conversation.

22:53.456 --> 22:54.998
But I risk my life
to see you.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.042
I looked you up.
You fix people.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.668
When everyone else
gives up, you don't!

22:58.794 --> 23:00.712
And now you insult me?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.422
Ignore my wife?

23:02.548 --> 23:03.590
Helps my process.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.258
You do not ignore my wife,
okay?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.593
She is everything to me.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.595
Well, then you do
not ignore your wife.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.598
You just sit here!
You don't talk to people.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.517
How do you fix something
if you don't look at it?

23:28.574 --> 23:30.366
Turn on bypass, please.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.705
Good. Good distal flow.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.708
Need to look
at the heart.

23:38.834 --> 23:39.667
Why?

23:39.794 --> 23:42.337
I can't find my wallet.
Pick it up. Turn it over.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.380
I don't see anything
physically wrong with her heart.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.174
Hearts don't
stop for no reason.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.676
Okay.
Take your look.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.390
You see anything wrong?

23:57.978 --> 23:59.729
Give her a jump-start.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.403
Clear. Clear.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.991
Clear.

24:12.535 --> 24:13.368
And again.

24:14.745 --> 24:18.039
Clear! Clear! Clear!

24:19.750 --> 24:20.583
Again.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.045
Yeah, seventh time
is the charm. Sorry.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.840
I'll keep her on bypass until the
husband has a chance to say goodbye.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.550
I'm not telling
the husband anything

24:28.676 --> 24:29.759
until I can
tell him why his...

24:29.885 --> 24:31.136
It doesn't matter.

24:31.262 --> 24:34.013
Her heart can't start.
She's dead.

24:49.697 --> 24:51.156
I got you something.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.126
I'll miss you.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.296
I know you won't miss me,
but...

25:06.422 --> 25:09.549
I just thought it would be nice
for you to have that.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.304
I will miss you.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.436
Can I have a hug, too?

25:22.563 --> 25:24.105
The surgeon found nothing.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.940
He can't start her heart.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.152
What a thoughtful gift.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.778
Nice reminder
of intellectual theft

25:30.905 --> 25:32.447
to hang at your new
place of employment.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.408
You two can go.
Say hi to Chase for me.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.076
You're wearing lipstick.

25:37.703 --> 25:40.163
We can stay. We can run
another differential.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.457
You two have no theories
about why the heart stopped,

25:42.583 --> 25:43.791
which means I don't need you.
Go.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.419
It's too late for theories.
We need to tell the husband.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.962
- Tell him what?
- That it's over.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.964
- Why?
- Because her heart won't start!

25:50.090 --> 25:51.883
How can we tell him
there's no hope

25:52.009 --> 25:53.676
if we don't know
why there's no hope?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.846
He's not gonna pull
the plug on his wife.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.348
He risked his life
to get her to me.

25:58.474 --> 25:59.807
If he pulls the plug,
it means he's failed.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.768
If he pulls the plug,
it means you've failed.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.144
And you're okay with that?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.106
Go.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.416
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:26.460 --> 26:27.794
You look great.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.338
You know House firing you
has nothing to do with you.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.423
The why doesn't matter.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.217
Foreman will end up staying,
House will call you,

26:34.343 --> 26:36.135
probably yell at you
for not showing up.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.762
It's okay.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.558
He's right.
It's time for a change.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.644
You were right, too.

26:44.770 --> 26:49.816
The whole "It's Tuesday,
I like you." It was silly.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.695
Oh, don't give me that look.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.405
Don't feel sorry for me.

26:55.531 --> 26:59.450
Getting this job was the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.452
Everything about it.
And losing it?

27:02.955 --> 27:08.918
Well, I think it's
gonna be good, too.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.714
I'll miss you.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.384
Have you got time for
a drink or something?

27:17.303 --> 27:18.678
I think I should go.

27:21.557 --> 27:22.640
Yeah.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.631
How's it going?

27:58.469 --> 28:01.929
The way the security
light hits your legs,

28:03.599 --> 28:04.766
looks good.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.601
Thank you.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.314
If you're here
to yell at me about

28:11.440 --> 28:13.608
the Foreman-Chase situation,
it can wait.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.443
When do you plan
on telling the husband

28:15.569 --> 28:17.153
it's time to say
goodbye to his wife?

28:17.279 --> 28:18.905
Haven't put a clock on it.

28:19.031 --> 28:24.452
Other than your curiosity, do you have
any reason to keep her on bypass?

28:24.578 --> 28:26.704
Patient's husband
prefers her not dead.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.289
Or you want
a storybook ending

28:28.415 --> 28:30.750
for the young man who
crossed the ocean for his wife.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.502
This is not an act.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.212
- I don't care.
- Then pull the plug!

28:34.338 --> 28:36.631
What if I can fix it,
but I just don't know it yet?

28:36.757 --> 28:37.715
I know you care.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.258
I don't care!

28:40.469 --> 28:41.886
I really don't care.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.681
My motives are pure.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.685
If we do an autopsy
and we see, "Oops,

28:52.231 --> 28:56.067
"if I'd thought of that crazy idea,
we could have saved her,"

28:57.361 --> 28:58.986
then the husband
might be upset.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.197
You've done all you can do.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.449
It's time to let go.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.595
I was told
you didn't believe in God.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.681
I don't.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.144
I promise my wife I'll do everything
I can to fix her.

29:32.813 --> 29:36.482
If I don't pray,
then I don't do everything.

29:39.153 --> 29:43.281
It's not working.
She's not coming back.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.576
If you want to say goodbye,
you can come down to the ICU,

29:46.702 --> 29:49.078
and then I'll take her
off bypass.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.418
I'm sorry. I should have...

30:05.053 --> 30:07.680
Marina, I am so sorry.

30:10.476 --> 30:14.395
When you turn
the machine off, that's it?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.482
Yeah.

30:20.235 --> 30:22.570
Right now,
is her brain working?

30:22.696 --> 30:25.448
Probably.
Just not her heart.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.783
She seems like
she's just sleeping.

30:27.910 --> 30:29.327
She's not sleeping.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.496
We double-checked.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.513
Her heart? It beat?

31:31.557 --> 31:34.392
No, it's residual
flow from the bypass.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.520
No, I can feel it. Look!

31:55.414 --> 31:56.831
That is her heart, no?

31:57.541 --> 32:01.794
P wave, Q, R, S, T wave.
That's a normal normal.

32:03.547 --> 32:04.922
Esteban?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.757
Marina!

32:07.217 --> 32:09.010
Holy crap.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.846
Is this heaven?

32:12.848 --> 32:14.765
No, it's New Jersey.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.559
God sent you back to me.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.690
It's a miracle.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.201
It's impossible.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.411
Apparently not.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.830
Live hearts don't
stop for no reason.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.416
Dead hearts don't
start for no reason.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.542
Apparently they do.

32:41.877 --> 32:44.545
She's three hours off bypass
and still stable.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.172
And the pain is gone.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.256
No, it's not.

32:47.382 --> 32:50.009
You think she's lying
about feeling better?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.136
Just because it's not there now
doesn't mean it's gone.

32:52.262 --> 32:53.512
Just because
it was there before

32:53.639 --> 32:54.597
doesn't mean
it's coming back.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.557
Chase was probably right.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.559
She had some sort
of tropical infection

32:58.685 --> 33:01.103
that cleared when we put her on
antibiotics during the bypass.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.773
Antibiotics did not
bring her back to life.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.399
Other than a miracle,

33:05.525 --> 33:07.610
it's the only explanation
for her symptoms.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.864
How come God gets credit
whenever something good happens?

33:12.449 --> 33:14.575
Where was he
when her heart stopped?

33:17.537 --> 33:19.830
What if it wasn't human error?

33:22.668 --> 33:24.502
What if it was God's error?

33:24.628 --> 33:29.799
A congenital defect in an artery making
it susceptible to inflammation.

33:31.343 --> 33:32.635
We need to do
another angiogram.

33:32.761 --> 33:35.638
We've looked at her heart 100 different
ways. There was no evidence...

33:35.764 --> 33:36.847
The one time we
looked inside her heart,

33:36.973 --> 33:38.474
we stopped before
we could see anything.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.184
Because it stopped.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.031
Good news.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.325
I think we know
what the problem is.

33:56.660 --> 33:57.785
You mean "was."

33:57.911 --> 34:00.246
Hey, it's my first language,
not yours.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.749
If she wants to outlive Castro,
we need to fix her heart.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.377
In case
no one's filled you in,

34:06.503 --> 34:09.088
today is Monday,
which means you've been dead for a day.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.049
If that kind of
symptom comes back, it can get serious.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.095
I need to do
another angiogram.

34:16.221 --> 34:19.265
Wait. Wasn't that what caused
her heart to stop before?

34:19.391 --> 34:22.393
No, God caused that.
He's all-powerful, you know.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.564
He was watching
over us in the ocean

34:26.690 --> 34:28.482
and he's watching
over us now.

34:28.734 --> 34:32.153
Your rescuers didn't have wings,
they had a helicopter.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.279
Esteban prayed.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.198
Do you know how many little boys
are praying for jetpacks?

34:36.324 --> 34:38.492
How many priests
are praying for...

34:40.454 --> 34:41.537
Well,
that one actually works.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.080
You didn't bring me
back to him.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.540
And I'm not gonna
take you away from him,

34:44.666 --> 34:47.168
but if we don't do
this test, God will.

34:47.627 --> 34:51.630
You said there was no chance,
no hope, which means...

34:51.757 --> 34:53.048
Which means I was wrong.

34:53.175 --> 34:54.717
But I'm wrong all the time.

34:55.093 --> 34:58.053
My mistakes don't
prove there's a God.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.639
You came a long way
to see me.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.269
You gonna put her life
in God's hands or in mine?

35:15.655 --> 35:16.822
Ready?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.619
I better not
see you praying.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.747
I don't want to have
to fight for credit on this.

35:25.540 --> 35:29.502
Exiting the femoral,
entering the aortic arch.

35:29.628 --> 35:30.586
This is where...

35:30.712 --> 35:32.671
Where we stopped to
have a picnic last week.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.256
Her blood pressure's rising!

35:34.382 --> 35:37.593
Mine's rising, too. Of course,
I am doing battle with a deity.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.680
In the heart.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.351
Injecting the dye.

35:48.396 --> 35:51.649
Right coronary flow is unobstructed.
Left coronary flow looks normal.

35:51.942 --> 35:52.775
Looks like you're wrong.

35:52.901 --> 35:57.238
Either I'm right or this test
is about to go very bad.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.870
What's that?

36:08.667 --> 36:13.045
She has one, two,
a third ostium!

36:13.421 --> 36:16.632
How many is she
supposed to have? Dos.

36:17.050 --> 36:20.261
All the third one's doing is causing
inflammation, throwing off clots,

36:20.387 --> 36:21.971
getting in the way
of the angiogram.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.139
No human would
screw up that big.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.724
Don't worry.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.102
Just one more surgery,
it'll be fine.

36:28.687 --> 36:29.854
Thank God!

36:30.647 --> 36:32.690
Don't make me slap you!

36:47.122 --> 36:48.330
Hi.

36:49.082 --> 36:49.915
It's Tuesday.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.505
No, it's Monday.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.592
I know, I just...

37:01.094 --> 37:03.345
I didn't feel like waiting.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.485
I hear you got
another satisfied customer.

37:20.322 --> 37:23.282
One more and I get
a set of steak knives.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.623
Well, this is it.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.670
I appreciate
the opportunity you gave me.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.339
Didn't do it for you.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.508
Thought you were
the best guy for the job.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.802
Thanks, I guess.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.513
Which is why
I want you to stay.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.645
You're an important part
of the team.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.396
I need you.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.905
I know.
But I don't need you.

38:03.031 --> 38:04.865
And I definitely
don't wanna be you.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.033
You're miserable.

38:06.159 --> 38:08.410
I just solved
a case by predicting

38:08.536 --> 38:10.704
a never-before-seen
heart defect.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.456
A case you couldn't solve.

38:12.582 --> 38:13.749
A case you gave up on.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.250
I couldn't be happier.

38:15.377 --> 38:16.543
For two minutes, maybe.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.420
Until the next case
comes along.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.464
Until you're jonesing
for your next fix.

38:20.590 --> 38:23.384
This woman talks while
in full cardiac arrest

38:23.510 --> 38:25.678
and you're more excited
about the talking than the heart dying!

38:25.804 --> 38:26.929
The two were connected.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.806
I don't wanna solve cases.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.391
I wanna save lives.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.142
Do you think she cares?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.144
Do you think
the husband cares?

38:34.270 --> 38:35.479
You think the children
she can now have

38:35.605 --> 38:38.023
because of me are gonna care
why I saved her?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.275
- I care.
- About yourself!

38:40.694 --> 38:41.986
- About your own ego!
- House.

38:42.112 --> 38:44.613
You're the selfish bastard,
not me,

38:44.739 --> 38:46.323
which is why you took
so much pleasure in drawing out

38:46.449 --> 38:48.534
this little goodbye of yours
for the last three weeks.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.327
It wasn't for me,
it wasn't for anyone!

38:50.453 --> 38:52.371
It sure as hell
didn't help anyone!

39:09.055 --> 39:10.472
Nice try.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.101
Nice tries are worthless.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.255
You now have
a bigger office than I do.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.966
Why don't you go enjoy it?

39:49.387 --> 39:51.096
Better be naked pictures.

39:51.639 --> 39:52.890
My resignation letter.

40:01.024 --> 40:03.025
I've gotten
all I can from this job.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.446
What do you expect me to do?

40:08.573 --> 40:11.116
Break down and apologize?
Beg Chase to come back?

40:11.743 --> 40:12.576
No.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.537
I expect you to do
what you always do.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.498
I expect you to
make a joke and go on.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.544
I expect you to be just fine.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.633
I'll miss you.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.688
Genuine American cigars.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.857
You guys can't
get them in Cuba.

40:43.983 --> 40:45.526
100% healthy.

40:45.652 --> 40:47.402
Shouldn't you go home?

40:47.529 --> 40:50.155
Patient follow-up.
Very important.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.161
She looks great.
I think she's sleeping.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.582
She is sleeping,
I double-check.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.380
So, they all quit?

41:07.423 --> 41:09.842
Two of them quit.
I fired the third.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.760
It must be very hard
to lose your people.

41:12.428 --> 41:14.096
You must be very upset.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.141
Yeah, I must be.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.060
But you're not?

41:21.271 --> 41:22.771
I don't think I am.

41:25.316 --> 41:28.360
I think I'm okay.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.821
What are you going to do?

41:33.116 --> 41:34.616
God only knows.
