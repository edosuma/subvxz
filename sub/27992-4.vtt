WEBVTT

00:03.340 --> 00:06.175
Daniel Ugara came here
to find his sister.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.559
We think that Zezi is being held
by people traffickers.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.833
Right, you know what an awayday girl is?

00:11.858 --> 00:13.577
They come over on the ferry
to turn tricks.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.737
When they get enough money, they go home.

00:15.738 --> 00:17.697
- But that's not you?
- No.

00:17.698 --> 00:19.697
We need a hand in here, please!

00:19.698 --> 00:22.377
Calum Dunwoody died about 15 minutes ago.

00:22.378 --> 00:26.257
Keep your mouth shut if you want
to see your kids grow up.

00:26.258 --> 00:27.457
It's the money.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.257
- Give it to him, please.
- Give who it?

00:29.258 --> 00:31.857
Three or four flats
with trafficked girls in them.

00:31.858 --> 00:33.897
And what about Nigerian girls?

00:33.898 --> 00:35.297
Where did you get your tattoo?

00:35.298 --> 00:37.217
There was a snake on her hand.

00:37.218 --> 00:39.217
A snake with two heads.

00:39.218 --> 00:41.017
You'll be all right.

00:41.018 --> 00:42.058
Move it!

00:43.326 --> 00:47.257
Andrea thinks he sold
her business to Graeme Benson.

00:47.258 --> 00:49.697
- That's Shetland.
- You know it?

00:49.698 --> 00:51.377
Yeah, I know it.

00:51.378 --> 00:53.257
Somebody's threatening my daughter.

00:53.258 --> 00:56.137
I need you back at home
so I can keep an eye on you.

00:56.138 --> 00:57.618
Zezi never left Shetland.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.337
Down you go.

02:14.338 --> 02:16.377
It's OK, it's OK. Are you OK?

02:16.378 --> 02:17.537
She's grand.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.578
She's on the mend.

02:19.738 --> 02:20.778
What are they?

02:21.858 --> 02:22.898
Medicine.

02:34.978 --> 02:38.218
Oi! Let her sleep for a bit.

02:54.098 --> 02:56.537
I need to know what's going on.

02:56.538 --> 02:58.417
It's nothing to worry about.

02:58.418 --> 02:59.617
Well, clearly it is,

02:59.642 --> 03:01.817
or else you wouldn't have
had to smuggle me up here.

03:01.818 --> 03:03.617
That was just a precaution.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.417
Jimmy's just looking out for you, love.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.457
I'm not a child. OK?

03:07.458 --> 03:10.457
I have a right to know what
kind of danger I'm in.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.498
OK.

03:15.498 --> 03:22.017
We think that whoever murdered
Daniel Ugara and the Hayes

03:22.018 --> 03:24.458
is involved in people trafficking.

03:25.578 --> 03:28.442
I was following up a lead
when I was in Glasgow,

03:28.443 --> 03:31.457
and it looks like I might have rattled
somebody's cage.

03:31.458 --> 03:32.497
Whose cage?

03:32.498 --> 03:35.537
I don't know that yet,
but their response was

03:35.538 --> 03:36.840
to target you.

03:37.658 --> 03:41.257
And they followed you and they found
out where you lived

03:41.258 --> 03:43.217
and they took photographs.

03:43.218 --> 03:45.825
Now, that was probably just a warning,

03:45.850 --> 03:47.858
just to try and get me to back off,

03:47.883 --> 03:51.460
but these people kidnap
young women every day.

03:55.938 --> 03:56.978
Right.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.537
Thanks for telling me.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.097
You all right?

04:05.098 --> 04:06.260
Yeah.

04:06.978 --> 04:09.297
Cassie, this is Alex.

04:09.298 --> 04:12.017
He's going to be staying
around for the next few days.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.657
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Cassie.

04:13.658 --> 04:15.378
Are you old enough to be a cop, son?

04:16.571 --> 04:17.779
I'm 23.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.297
Can you handle yourself?

04:21.298 --> 04:23.298
- What?
- In a fight?

04:24.458 --> 04:27.020
Well, I can hold my own. Aye.

04:28.658 --> 04:30.777
Are you quite finished?

04:30.778 --> 04:31.818
Yes.

04:36.418 --> 04:37.458
Right.

04:38.498 --> 04:40.417
I'll keep coming back
to check in on you, OK?

04:40.418 --> 04:41.817
Yep, sure.

04:41.818 --> 04:43.898
- If anything happens, you call me.
- Yes, sir.

04:50.498 --> 04:54.018
Hey, Alice, I'm just phoning
to see if you're OK.

04:57.058 --> 04:58.778
We should probably talk.

04:59.858 --> 05:03.097
It would be good to meet, so give
me a call when you get a minute.

05:03.098 --> 05:04.138
Bye.

05:08.538 --> 05:12.697
Right, Aaron McGuire is still
prime suspect in the murders

05:12.698 --> 05:16.817
of Daniel Ugara,
Prentice Hayes and Carla Hayes.

05:16.818 --> 05:20.257
And we suspect that he's holding
Zezi Ugara, and possibly

05:20.258 --> 05:21.298
another girl, too.

05:22.618 --> 05:26.057
Now, Sandy went to see
Morag Dunwoody yesterday,

05:26.058 --> 05:29.657
and she claims that there were no
women on board Silver Darling

05:29.658 --> 05:32.217
the night that Calum
sailed for the mainland.

05:32.218 --> 05:35.057
Yeah, it's probably not the smartest
move, under the circumstances,

05:35.058 --> 05:36.777
but it did get us some
useful information.

05:36.778 --> 05:39.097
Namely, that these women
are still on the island.

05:39.098 --> 05:40.603
But how do we find them,

05:40.628 --> 05:42.497
short of searching every
house in Shetland?

05:42.498 --> 05:43.685
If they are here,

05:44.972 --> 05:48.217
then I reckon McGuire is too.

05:48.218 --> 05:50.777
And I reckon that he's going
to have to surface at some point.

05:50.778 --> 05:54.017
So, Billy, check everything
that we've got on McGuire

05:54.018 --> 05:56.857
because if we can find even a
trace, then at least we can narrow

05:56.858 --> 05:58.057
the search a wee bit.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.817
We're also going to have to look
at this guy, Graeme Benson.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.977
He's originally from Shetland.

06:02.978 --> 06:04.257
He's based in Glasgow now.

06:04.258 --> 06:07.940
He's made his money in property
and he owns the MacBay Hotel.

06:08.298 --> 06:12.057
I think he's the one
that's organising the trafficking.

06:12.058 --> 06:14.537
So, McGuire is working for Benson?

06:14.538 --> 06:18.017
Ah! I don't know that yet.

06:18.018 --> 06:21.440
But check out whoever he's
been in contact with up here.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.338
OK?

06:39.618 --> 06:40.778
How are the kids doing?

06:42.218 --> 06:43.458
I haven't told them yet.

06:46.938 --> 06:48.620
And how are you holding up?

06:49.458 --> 06:51.017
Look, what is it that you want?

06:51.018 --> 06:54.137
Calum said that there were no women
on board on the night that he made

06:54.138 --> 06:55.900
the crossing to the mainland.

06:56.820 --> 06:58.777
- Did he?
- That's what you told me.

06:58.778 --> 07:00.860
Yeah, well, whatever I said, ignore it.

07:01.698 --> 07:03.497
I was upset. I don't know anything.

07:03.498 --> 07:04.618
I don't believe that.

07:09.618 --> 07:11.540
Calum didn't like doing it, did he?

07:12.940 --> 07:16.017
I mean, he was a decent man, so that
wouldn't have sat well with him.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.020
Carrying people on the boat like that.

07:19.418 --> 07:21.777
I think he talked to you about it,
Morag, because he didn't

07:21.778 --> 07:23.658
have anybody else to talk to about it.

07:25.418 --> 07:27.777
Morag, it's important.

07:27.778 --> 07:29.937
There are people in danger. Other girls.

07:29.938 --> 07:32.018
Oh, and you think I give
a shit about them?

07:33.778 --> 07:35.697
I have just lost my husband.

07:35.698 --> 07:37.418
My kids have just lost their dad!

07:39.498 --> 07:45.257
I have no interest in some... wee
lassies that have got themselves

07:45.258 --> 07:47.338
involved with those evil bastards.

07:48.658 --> 07:50.617
Oh, you're something else.

07:50.618 --> 07:52.098
God, you're something else!

07:54.418 --> 07:55.538
People are in danger?

07:57.698 --> 07:59.858
No, Calum was in danger.

08:00.071 --> 08:01.911
And you didn't bother helping him.

08:05.298 --> 08:07.177
What was she like last time?

08:07.178 --> 08:08.737
She wasn't as jittery as that.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.258
I think somebody's got to her.

08:15.858 --> 08:19.697
Get the patrol car to take a run
past Morag's house this afternoon

08:19.698 --> 08:22.497
and see if you can get a list of the
calls going in and out of the house.

08:22.498 --> 08:24.977
Billy, where are we with
tracking McGuire?

08:24.978 --> 08:27.817
So far, there's no trace of him
being on Shetland in the last week.

08:27.818 --> 08:29.577
He's here somewhere, Billy.

08:29.578 --> 08:33.020
You wanted to know who Graeme Benson
was in contact with?

08:34.258 --> 08:35.297
Carla Hayes?

08:35.298 --> 08:38.897
Benson called her mobile four times
in the week before she was killed.

08:38.898 --> 08:40.937
Have you got any idea
what these calls were about?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.457
No, but it must have been important.

08:42.457 --> 08:45.140
The last one lasted 50-odd minutes.

08:45.618 --> 08:47.340
Sandy, can I have a word?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.338
You'd better come too, Jimmy.

08:52.178 --> 08:54.340
I've spoken to the PIRC.

08:55.538 --> 08:59.057
And we've decided that
Calum Dunwoody's suicide

08:59.058 --> 09:00.818
warrants further investigation.

09:03.498 --> 09:04.538
I'm sorry, Sandy.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.937
Be all right.

09:07.938 --> 09:08.978
Will it?

09:10.418 --> 09:11.818
I know how these things go.

09:12.778 --> 09:14.257
Everybody wants a scapegoat.

09:14.258 --> 09:15.497
No. No, no, no.

09:15.498 --> 09:18.857
No, we just want
to establish all the facts.

09:18.858 --> 09:19.960
Well, I gave you the facts,

09:19.985 --> 09:22.617
and I had no idea he was
going to do what he did.

09:22.618 --> 09:24.378
Where are you going? To call my rep.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.458
I'm making lunch, you hungry?

09:31.778 --> 09:32.817
I'm not sure.

09:32.818 --> 09:34.617
You're not sure if you're hungry?

09:34.618 --> 09:37.257
No, he never said anything about lunch.

09:37.258 --> 09:38.497
Who didn't?

09:38.498 --> 09:40.217
The boss.

09:40.218 --> 09:43.098
It might not look too good if he
comes in to see me feeding my face.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.858
Are you afraid of my dad?

09:48.058 --> 09:50.457
Frankly, aye.

09:50.458 --> 09:54.537
Well, this stuff needs used
up by today, so you may as well eat.

09:54.538 --> 09:56.538
- Grab me a chopping board, will you?
- Yeah.

10:04.138 --> 10:06.897
OK, where is this chopping board?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.178
Sorry, bottom cupboard.

10:22.898 --> 10:25.297
So, if Carla was working for Benson,

10:25.298 --> 10:27.817
are we saying he's the one
who ordered the attack on the Hayes?

10:27.818 --> 10:29.457
I don't know.

10:29.458 --> 10:32.297
But if he is running the operation,
then he's bound to have the right

10:32.298 --> 10:35.018
kind of mean bastards to carry it out.

10:37.658 --> 10:40.018
You did the right thing,
bringing Cassie home.

10:41.418 --> 10:42.458
Ah!

10:44.098 --> 10:45.377
I put her at risk.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.698
It wasn't your fault.

10:47.738 --> 10:49.417
Well, my job made her a target.

10:49.418 --> 10:50.777
She's vulnerable because of me.

10:50.778 --> 10:52.580
Cassie isn't vulnerable.

10:53.138 --> 10:57.217
She's got you and she's got Duncan
and, in case you hadn't noticed,

10:57.218 --> 10:59.898
your wee girl grew up to be
a pretty tough young woman.

11:00.898 --> 11:02.058
That's because of you.

11:08.298 --> 11:11.418
- She's smart, too.
- She gets that from her mum.

11:16.378 --> 11:19.097
I told you, if there was anything
dodgy going on, that was

11:19.098 --> 11:20.457
down to Prentice.

11:20.458 --> 11:21.618
I kept my nose out of it.

11:23.818 --> 11:25.777
What about your mum?

11:25.778 --> 11:26.897
What about her?

11:26.898 --> 11:31.137
Well, did she keep her nose out of it,
or was she the one organising it all?

11:31.138 --> 11:32.777
Organising what?

11:32.778 --> 11:34.977
Look, for the last time,
Prentice was the one...

11:34.978 --> 11:37.738
Jamie, come on! I've heard the speech.

11:38.898 --> 11:42.457
Now, you can't keep blaming
everything on your dead brother,

11:42.458 --> 11:43.897
because Prentice was small-time.

11:43.898 --> 11:46.977
He was a pimp and a dealer,
he wasn't a big enough player

11:46.978 --> 11:49.860
to warrant getting wiped out
along with his family.

11:50.498 --> 11:52.300
This is about something bigger.

11:53.058 --> 11:55.137
And I need to know
what your mum was involved in.

11:55.138 --> 11:56.857
She wasn't involved in anything.

11:56.858 --> 11:59.817
This isn't just about your family, Jamie.
There are other people at risk.

11:59.818 --> 12:02.857
What, like that mad woman's
daughter? Olivia?

12:02.858 --> 12:06.537
Yeah, you ought to rein her in.

12:06.538 --> 12:09.177
She was here last night, tried to
make out I knew where her kid was.

12:09.178 --> 12:10.418
Do you know where she is?

12:11.878 --> 12:12.918
Of course I don't.

12:18.378 --> 12:19.697
Have you seen this guy before?

12:19.698 --> 12:21.300
- No.
- You barely looked.

12:25.618 --> 12:26.778
You do know him?

12:28.377 --> 12:31.820
It's Graeme Benson, Mum's pal.

12:34.658 --> 12:36.137
Was your mum working with him?

12:36.138 --> 12:37.377
What?

12:37.378 --> 12:38.977
No. No, they were mates.

12:38.978 --> 12:40.737
They went to school together.

12:40.738 --> 12:42.697
They'd catch up when
he came up from Glasgow.

12:42.698 --> 12:45.180
So, when was the last time she saw him?

12:45.938 --> 12:47.380
I don't know.

12:47.818 --> 12:49.420
A couple of weeks ago?

12:51.658 --> 12:52.698
Ah.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.977
They were just pals.

12:55.978 --> 12:57.018
That's all!

13:05.018 --> 13:06.378
Tosh, give me a wee minute.

13:12.338 --> 13:14.097
What are you doing here?

13:14.098 --> 13:15.698
Jamie asked me to come and stay.

13:16.738 --> 13:17.778
Jamie?

13:19.778 --> 13:21.817
You mean the guy that
had you selling yourself

13:21.818 --> 13:24.497
out of a caravan up there
until a few days ago?

13:24.498 --> 13:25.940
That was Prentice.

13:28.658 --> 13:32.420
Rosie, this isn't a good idea.

13:33.298 --> 13:34.617
What do you mean?

13:34.618 --> 13:37.060
You and Jamie.

13:38.258 --> 13:39.937
Why not me and Jamie?

13:39.938 --> 13:40.978
We get on.

13:41.978 --> 13:44.298
Besides, I've nowhere else to go.

14:02.378 --> 14:04.697
What were you doing up there?

14:04.698 --> 14:06.857
Trying to pay the rent.

14:06.858 --> 14:11.417
Jamie Hayes doesn't know where
Zezi is, and he's not holding her.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.017
Now, you don't know that for sure.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.700
You don't know anything!

14:15.178 --> 14:18.617
They sent that video a week ago, and
you still have no idea where she is.

14:18.618 --> 14:20.177
We're doing everything we can.

14:20.178 --> 14:22.578
- You failed my kids.
- No, that's not true.

14:25.018 --> 14:27.977
Look, I understand how you feel,
I have a daughter of my own.

14:27.978 --> 14:29.820
No, you don't, though, do you?

14:30.698 --> 14:32.017
I've been asking round.

14:32.018 --> 14:35.297
That daughter that you talk about,
she's not really yours, is she?

14:35.298 --> 14:36.897
OK, that's not helping.

14:36.898 --> 14:40.060
Me and Zezi and Daniel are blood.

14:42.618 --> 14:43.737
And blood is everything.

14:43.738 --> 14:44.777
Is that so?

14:44.778 --> 14:47.737
Which is why I'm not
going anywhere until I find her.

14:47.738 --> 14:51.900
So where were you three weeks ago
when Daniel came looking for you?

14:52.698 --> 14:54.497
When your son came to ask you for help?

14:54.498 --> 14:56.297
Where were you then, Olivia?

14:56.298 --> 14:59.217
I told you, I couldn't make it.

14:59.218 --> 15:01.657
Yeah, well, maybe you should have.

15:01.658 --> 15:03.538
Because I'd have been there for mine.

15:15.818 --> 15:17.497
You OK?

15:17.498 --> 15:19.177
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:19.178 --> 15:20.418
Let's just call it a day.

15:40.098 --> 15:42.417
I'm sorry, I've been trying
to call you all day.

15:42.418 --> 15:44.177
- It's just been...
- It's all right, really.

15:44.178 --> 15:49.337
Look, shall we go somewhere and grab
a drink and then we can talk?

15:49.338 --> 15:51.297
Jimmy...

15:51.298 --> 15:52.337
Oh, hi, Jimmy.

15:52.338 --> 15:53.897
Hey, Chris, how are you doing?

15:53.898 --> 15:55.817
Yeah, I can't complain.

15:55.818 --> 15:57.537
I was just bringing Duncan's keys back.

15:57.538 --> 16:00.154
Yeah, Chris has been helping Duncan
with the refitting at the bistro.

16:00.155 --> 16:01.418
Ah, OK, OK.

16:03.178 --> 16:05.444
We're just about to go for something
to eat. Do you want to come?

16:05.445 --> 16:09.020
Um... No, Cassie's home, so...

16:10.418 --> 16:12.297
- Well, we'd better be off.
- Yeah.

16:12.298 --> 16:13.320
All right.

16:13.345 --> 16:15.020
- All right, see you later, Jimmy.
- Bye.

16:42.538 --> 16:45.057
- You were warned.
- Oh, no, no, wait.

16:45.058 --> 16:46.898
I... I didn't say anything to...

17:03.618 --> 17:04.657
How's the Marquez?

17:06.338 --> 17:07.377
What?

17:10.178 --> 17:11.218
Oh!

17:12.377 --> 17:14.778
No, I've barely had time to start it.

17:17.738 --> 17:20.578
I wouldn't have thought magic
realism was your cup of tea.

17:23.698 --> 17:25.417
It was Alice that recommended it.

17:28.178 --> 17:32.220
His other one's better,
Love In The Time Of Cholera.

17:32.938 --> 17:34.337
It's a better story.

17:34.338 --> 17:35.700
- Is it?
- Mm-hm.

17:36.978 --> 17:39.977
It's about this guy who falls
in love with this girl,

17:39.978 --> 17:44.297
but she ends up marrying someone
else, so he has to wait 50 years

17:44.298 --> 17:47.258
until the husband dies,
and then he gets together with her.

17:54.978 --> 17:57.218
Well, I guess I don't need
to read it now, do I?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.020
You can talk to me.

18:09.738 --> 18:10.778
I know.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.740
So, talk to me.

18:16.898 --> 18:17.938
What about?

18:20.738 --> 18:22.978
- What's going on with you and Alice?
- Nothing.

18:27.138 --> 18:28.658
Nothing worth talking about.

18:33.738 --> 18:34.778
OK.

20:02.178 --> 20:03.218
Oh, God!

20:04.658 --> 20:05.698
Oh, God!

20:19.898 --> 20:21.360
- Come on!
- Mummy!

20:21.385 --> 20:22.600
Come on!

20:44.180 --> 20:45.777
What's happened?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.377
House was attacked last night.

20:47.378 --> 20:49.660
They put a petrol bomb
through the window.

20:50.818 --> 20:53.058
- Where's Morag and the kids?
- They got out.

21:03.098 --> 21:04.138
You OK?

21:07.498 --> 21:09.177
Who did it, Morag?

21:09.178 --> 21:10.218
I don't know.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.378
I really don't know.

21:19.418 --> 21:20.458
OK.

21:22.338 --> 21:25.258
You can't stay here. We have to
move you to somewhere safe.

21:26.858 --> 21:27.898
Not the station.

21:30.658 --> 21:31.698
OK.

21:36.058 --> 21:38.858
- When can we get in the house?
- Soon as the fire crew say so.

21:40.898 --> 21:45.617
OK, until we get the all clear,
check the outside,

21:45.618 --> 21:48.577
tyre tracks, footprints,
whatever we can use.

21:48.578 --> 21:52.217
Tosh, get some of these uniforms
together and go and check

21:52.218 --> 21:54.897
the neighbours' houses, see if
anybody saw anything last night.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.320
I've called the forensics team,
they're on their way over.

21:57.345 --> 21:58.500
OK.

22:09.138 --> 22:11.457
Alice, it's Jimmy.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.498
I need your help.

22:28.778 --> 22:30.057
Toilet.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.098
Let's go.

22:40.178 --> 22:42.537
- You need help?
- I'll be OK.

22:42.538 --> 22:43.578
OK.

22:53.378 --> 22:54.778
Told you she'd be all right.

23:02.178 --> 23:03.900
We should have a wee party.

23:04.538 --> 23:05.857
What?

23:05.858 --> 23:07.578
To celebrate her getting better.

23:09.458 --> 23:10.937
I'll cook.

23:16.418 --> 23:17.977
- It's OK.
- I'm OK.

23:17.978 --> 23:19.338
Of course you are. Come on.

23:44.018 --> 23:45.057
How are they doing?

23:45.058 --> 23:46.777
Aye, they're pretty shaken up.

23:46.778 --> 23:48.897
Listen, thanks for sorting
this place so quickly.

23:48.898 --> 23:49.937
Oh, that's OK.

23:49.938 --> 23:52.697
We always keep a place free
for families in emergencies.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.417
I've picked up some food.

23:54.418 --> 23:56.937
It's not much, but it should
get them through the day.

23:56.938 --> 23:58.538
OK, thanks, I appreciate that.

24:02.218 --> 24:03.940
Call me if you need anything.

24:04.938 --> 24:05.978
Thank you.

24:08.898 --> 24:09.938
Alice?

24:12.418 --> 24:14.300
We should probably talk later.

24:14.818 --> 24:17.177
Yeah, get them settled, then call me.

24:17.178 --> 24:18.218
OK.

24:27.738 --> 24:29.938
There's nothing that
I can do, I'm working.

24:32.298 --> 24:34.100
You just go to a pal's house!

24:36.098 --> 24:37.580
It's not my problem.

24:41.218 --> 24:44.137
Sorry, it's my little sister,
she's locked herself

24:44.138 --> 24:46.140
out of the house again.

24:46.698 --> 24:48.537
Can't you go and give her her keys?

24:48.538 --> 24:50.617
I'm not going to leave you here alone.

24:50.618 --> 24:52.258
Your house is just down the road.

24:58.098 --> 24:59.497
I'll be fine!

24:59.498 --> 25:01.457
Off you go!

25:01.458 --> 25:02.777
Why don't you come with me?

25:02.778 --> 25:04.538
I can't, this was due in yesterday.

25:07.058 --> 25:08.377
I'll just run round.

25:08.378 --> 25:09.417
Fine.

25:09.418 --> 25:10.657
I'll be five minutes, tops.

25:10.658 --> 25:12.380
Will you just go?

25:15.698 --> 25:16.938
Lock the door behind me?

25:33.778 --> 25:35.298
You don't have to knock, Alex!

25:45.258 --> 25:46.580
You must be Cassie.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.697
You finished already?

25:53.698 --> 25:56.257
Aye, it went in easier than expected.

25:56.258 --> 25:57.617
Oh, it looks fantastic.

25:57.618 --> 25:58.658
Thanks.

26:00.538 --> 26:02.017
You the only one here?

26:02.018 --> 26:03.058
Yeah.

26:04.218 --> 26:09.217
Your project manager came by,
asked me to pass on a message.

26:09.218 --> 26:12.618
He says they're downing tools
until you make last month's payment.

26:15.218 --> 26:17.737
- Shite!
- How bad is it?

26:17.738 --> 26:22.057
Oh, you know, there's always cash
flow problems in projects like this.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.777
But it's only temporary?

26:23.778 --> 26:24.938
Well, I bloody hope so.

26:27.778 --> 26:29.537
I can take a couple of days off.

26:29.538 --> 26:32.177
- I'm more than happy to pitch in.
- No, I can't ask you to do that.

26:32.178 --> 26:33.857
It's not a problem.

26:33.858 --> 26:35.497
I've been where you are.

26:35.498 --> 26:36.978
A little help goes a long way.

26:40.898 --> 26:42.697
So, you're a friend of my dad's?

26:42.698 --> 26:45.857
Well, more of an acquaintance,
really, but...

26:45.858 --> 26:47.777
He's at work right now.

26:47.778 --> 26:50.297
I can give him a call, if you want.

26:50.298 --> 26:51.497
No need.

26:51.498 --> 26:54.580
I'm sure we'll bump
into each other soon enough.

26:55.338 --> 26:57.617
Shouldn't you be in Glasgow?

26:57.618 --> 26:59.338
You're at the university, right?

27:00.538 --> 27:02.177
I'm taking time off.

27:02.178 --> 27:04.137
Well, quite right.

27:04.138 --> 27:06.580
It's good to take a break now and again.

27:07.178 --> 27:09.777
Your generation works too hard.

27:09.778 --> 27:13.537
I'm forever warning my girls,
you're going to burn yourselves out.

27:13.538 --> 27:17.020
Actually, you might
know my eldest, Ellie.

27:17.898 --> 27:19.857
Ellie Benson.

27:19.858 --> 27:21.540
She's at Glasgow, too.

27:22.178 --> 27:24.100
Sorry, I don't.

27:25.898 --> 27:28.858
She's got a flat in... Ruthven Street.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.378
You live anywhere near there?

27:37.098 --> 27:39.057
I told you to lock the door when I left.

27:39.058 --> 27:41.538
What is the point in even
saying that if you're...?

27:42.938 --> 27:44.697
Who's this?

27:44.698 --> 27:46.860
It's Mr Benson.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.177
He's looking for Dad.

27:49.178 --> 27:53.618
But it seems that he is not here,
so I'd best be heading off.

27:55.258 --> 27:56.738
Nice talking to you, Cassie.

28:03.298 --> 28:07.020
Do you remember anything about
the attack on the house last night?

28:07.938 --> 28:09.740
I remember there was a car.

28:12.118 --> 28:13.158
What kind of car?

28:14.258 --> 28:17.220
It was dark, I couldn't tell.

28:19.258 --> 28:20.298
She called...

28:22.364 --> 28:23.404
...before it happened.

28:25.458 --> 28:26.620
Who did?

28:27.218 --> 28:30.860
Well, the woman,
the one who threatened us.

28:31.978 --> 28:34.057
About an hour before.

28:34.058 --> 28:36.057
Did you recognise the voice?

28:36.058 --> 28:37.098
No.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.658
The accent was Glaswegian, though.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.498
OK.

28:47.138 --> 28:48.480
Morag,

28:49.506 --> 28:53.257
at some point, you're going
to have to make a choice.

28:53.258 --> 28:57.360
You're going to have to
tell me everything you know

28:57.385 --> 28:59.097
about the people Calum worked for.

28:59.098 --> 29:00.898
There's nothing I can tell you.

29:02.498 --> 29:06.613
That was the deal. He
never gave me names or

29:06.638 --> 29:09.098
details or anything that
would make me part of it.

29:11.538 --> 29:13.898
I figured the less I knew,
the safer I would be.

29:16.978 --> 29:18.818
Must've told you something, Morag.

29:24.338 --> 29:25.378
Morag?

29:28.978 --> 29:30.018
The boy...

29:33.658 --> 29:35.018
...the one that was killed.

29:37.298 --> 29:38.338
Daniel Ugara.

29:40.458 --> 29:46.658
A few weeks back, I came through
to find Calum in the kitchen.

29:48.597 --> 29:49.957
It was four in the morning.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.418
He was just sitting there.

29:55.498 --> 29:58.260
Sobbing, like a kid.

30:00.698 --> 30:03.100
I never saw him cry like that before.

30:06.618 --> 30:08.737
He dumped his body at sea.

30:08.738 --> 30:14.817
Morag claims that they forced Calum
to get rid of Daniel's body parts.

30:14.818 --> 30:17.697
- Did you tell her who they were?
- Unfortunately not, no.

30:17.698 --> 30:20.897
However, she did say
that she received threatening phone

30:20.898 --> 30:24.697
calls from a woman before
the house was firebombed.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.777
- From a woman?
- Mm, with a Glasgow accent.

30:27.778 --> 30:29.677
Who the hell is she?

30:29.678 --> 30:31.337
McGuire's ex-wife?

30:31.338 --> 30:33.777
Or was there anyone else in Glasgow?

30:33.778 --> 30:35.460
It could be Andrea Doyle.

30:36.578 --> 30:42.937
We came across a witness in Glasgow
who claimed that Doyle was the one

30:42.938 --> 30:45.697
who'd tattooed the trafficked girls.

30:45.698 --> 30:49.897
We tried to find her, but it seems
she up and vanished.

30:49.898 --> 30:51.980
And you think she's turned up here?

30:52.618 --> 30:54.140
It's a long shot.

30:55.178 --> 30:58.657
But if Doyle was the one
who was branding the girls,

30:58.658 --> 31:02.458
then she'd know McGuire, so...

31:04.818 --> 31:06.780
Maybe she's here with him?

31:10.298 --> 31:13.977
Sandy, pull up last night's CCTV
and see if you can spot anybody

31:13.978 --> 31:16.177
in the roads out to the Dunwoodys'.

31:16.178 --> 31:18.897
Where are we on Graeme Benson's movement?

31:18.898 --> 31:20.777
He was in Shetland the week Daniel died.

31:20.778 --> 31:22.377
I checked the flight records.

31:22.378 --> 31:24.937
And what about when the Hayes died?

31:24.938 --> 31:26.737
Couldn't find anything concrete.

31:26.738 --> 31:28.817
If he was on the island
at that time, he didn't come

31:28.818 --> 31:30.977
by plane, and he wasn't
booked on the ferry.

31:30.978 --> 31:32.897
That doesn't mean he wasn't here, though.

31:32.898 --> 31:33.938
Boss?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.417
Have you heard the news?

31:43.418 --> 31:44.897
What news?

31:44.898 --> 31:48.017
Marine Scotland have closed
down the processing plant.

31:48.018 --> 31:49.057
When?

31:49.058 --> 31:50.220
This morning.

31:54.418 --> 31:55.780
When did he turn up?

31:57.178 --> 31:58.420
About an hour ago.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.058
Why did you let him in the house?

32:03.938 --> 32:06.220
I wasn't actually there
when he showed up.

32:07.058 --> 32:08.537
What do you mean, you weren't there?

32:08.538 --> 32:10.738
It doesn't matter, Dad. Nothing happened.

32:13.258 --> 32:14.298
Billy!

32:16.578 --> 32:19.500
- Who do you need?
- Find me Graeme Benson.

32:27.058 --> 32:28.457
Is it true?

32:28.458 --> 32:30.777
Laird made the announcement an hour ago.

32:30.778 --> 32:32.817
We're all out of a job.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.897
The cheek, showing your face around here!

32:34.898 --> 32:38.857
This is down to you and your boss,
putting people out of business.

32:38.858 --> 32:40.297
Now, come on.

32:40.298 --> 32:41.338
It's not worth it.

32:46.578 --> 32:48.777
Don't let Laird get to you.

32:48.778 --> 32:51.297
It's his fault they closed
the place down.

32:51.298 --> 32:52.857
Still...

32:52.858 --> 32:54.577
...I am sorry.

32:54.578 --> 32:56.377
Blessing in disguise.

32:56.378 --> 32:58.820
I've been wanting to quit
that place for ages.

32:59.418 --> 33:01.097
Are you going to be OK for money?

33:01.098 --> 33:02.937
Of course I will.

33:02.938 --> 33:06.577
Push comes to shove, I can always
knock off a bank or two.

33:06.578 --> 33:09.577
Well, if you need any help with rent
or anything, you know, just ask.

33:09.578 --> 33:11.618
Don't worry, I won't be shy.

33:13.858 --> 33:16.058
What about Donnie, how's he?

33:17.538 --> 33:19.577
Donnie will be fine.

33:19.578 --> 33:21.177
Well, he's got brains.

33:21.178 --> 33:22.338
He'll land on his feet.

33:24.618 --> 33:26.340
You seeing him again?

33:27.698 --> 33:29.417
I don't know.

33:29.418 --> 33:30.937
You don't like him?

33:30.938 --> 33:35.137
No, I like him, I do,
I just don't know if he wants

33:35.138 --> 33:36.497
to see me again.

33:36.498 --> 33:38.897
Bloody hell, Tosh!

33:38.898 --> 33:40.257
What?

33:40.258 --> 33:42.209
It's a wonder you catch
any criminals at all,

33:42.234 --> 33:44.180
being as stupid as you are!

33:45.178 --> 33:47.938
I'm pretty sure he wants
to see you again.

33:48.417 --> 33:49.857
The lad's mad about you!

34:08.658 --> 34:10.617
I warned you!

34:10.618 --> 34:13.016
I told you what would happen
if you threatened my daughter!

34:13.018 --> 34:15.137
- I didn't know that Cassie was there.
- It's our house!

34:15.138 --> 34:16.480
I thought she was still in Glasgow,

34:16.505 --> 34:18.417
- I went there to see her father.
- I'm her father!

34:18.418 --> 34:20.456
I mean her biological
father, Duncan Hunter.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.536
Andy here told me that Duncan
was living at your house.

34:23.538 --> 34:26.138
I'm deeply sorry if I upset Cassie.

34:31.578 --> 34:33.777
And what do you want with Duncan?

34:33.777 --> 34:35.744
Just hoping to discuss some business.

34:35.745 --> 34:37.577
That'll be the same business
you had with Carla Hayes?

34:37.578 --> 34:39.617
Come on! I was friends with Carla.

34:39.618 --> 34:41.536
Well, you don't seem
that upset by her death.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.820
On the contrary, I am very upset.

34:45.297 --> 34:47.618
And what about Daniel Ugara,
did you know him?

34:50.098 --> 34:51.817
No, no. Who's he?

34:51.818 --> 34:53.937
He was killed in Shetland
just around the time

34:53.938 --> 34:55.152
of your last visit.

34:55.154 --> 34:56.288
What do you want me to say to that?

34:56.313 --> 34:58.802
I am just a businessman, that's all!

35:02.858 --> 35:07.538
See, whatever it is you're up to,
I hope for your sake it's legal.

35:21.978 --> 35:24.177
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:24.178 --> 35:26.178
- How you doing?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

35:27.378 --> 35:28.977
Morag and the kids?

35:28.978 --> 35:31.560
- Yeah, they're settling in.
- Good.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.337
Do you want to go and get a seat
and I'll get some drinks?

35:38.338 --> 35:40.100
- Gin and tonic.
- OK.

35:44.258 --> 35:46.377
I spent the last few days
trying to convince myself

35:46.378 --> 35:47.658
it didn't mean anything.

35:50.058 --> 35:52.380
It was just a kiss, after all.

35:53.778 --> 35:54.818
Thanks.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.460
I didn't mean it like that.

35:59.578 --> 36:00.618
I know.

36:01.738 --> 36:02.778
Oh, God!

36:04.018 --> 36:05.740
This is a bloody mess.

36:09.858 --> 36:10.898
It'll be all right.

36:14.898 --> 36:15.938
No, it won't.

36:19.338 --> 36:21.780
Because I can't stop thinking about you.

36:23.298 --> 36:24.338
About us.

36:25.738 --> 36:28.577
Please don't sit there and tell me
you haven't been thinking the same.

36:28.578 --> 36:31.220
Well, it doesn't really matter
what I think, does it?

36:32.338 --> 36:35.817
I mean, nothing else can happen,
not while you and Chris

36:35.818 --> 36:36.858
are still together.

36:39.258 --> 36:40.620
Well, what if we weren't?

36:44.578 --> 36:46.097
Alice, Alice, it's not fair.

36:46.098 --> 36:48.340
- What isn't?
- Well...

36:52.338 --> 36:55.817
I can't sit here and tell
you to end your marriage.

36:55.818 --> 36:58.897
I mean, that's your choice,
it's got nothing to do with me.

36:58.898 --> 36:59.937
Bollocks!

36:59.938 --> 37:02.698
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't
even be thinking about it.

37:10.258 --> 37:11.498
Do you still love Chris?

37:17.178 --> 37:18.218
I don't know.

37:21.578 --> 37:23.938
OK, well, until you've
figured that one out...

37:27.204 --> 37:29.324
...nothing else can happen between us.

37:33.138 --> 37:34.178
Yeah.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.697
OK, what are you having?

37:40.698 --> 37:42.097
Don't be daft, I'm buying!

37:42.098 --> 37:44.140
No, you can get the meal!

37:44.938 --> 37:46.337
All right.

37:46.338 --> 37:47.498
Pint of lager, please.

37:54.938 --> 37:56.377
You know what? I'm starving.

37:56.378 --> 37:57.697
Let's get a curry.

37:57.698 --> 37:58.737
Are you sure?

37:58.738 --> 38:00.858
Aye, aye, there's a place
just up the road.

38:02.178 --> 38:03.218
Fair enough.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.137
You found anything on the CCTV?

38:21.138 --> 38:22.697
No.

38:22.698 --> 38:24.657
But this is just the first camera.

38:24.658 --> 38:26.217
We've got another 20 to go.

38:26.218 --> 38:27.618
You could be here all night!

38:29.058 --> 38:31.097
That's fine by me.

38:31.098 --> 38:32.497
Do you want some help?

38:32.498 --> 38:34.857
No. It's OK, truly.

38:34.858 --> 38:36.938
There is no point in
both of us being here.

38:38.658 --> 38:41.380
You should get out, have fun.

38:42.538 --> 38:43.578
Have fun?

38:45.938 --> 38:46.978
I don't know!

38:48.338 --> 38:53.380
Just go and do something
that isn't in here.

38:54.618 --> 38:56.580
Good luck. See you tomorrow.

39:08.018 --> 39:09.058
Both of you are hungry?

39:12.858 --> 39:15.938
I'm doing that speciality dish.

39:17.778 --> 39:19.177
Smells good.

39:19.178 --> 39:21.097
What is it?

39:21.098 --> 39:24.060
Pasta puttanesca.

39:26.258 --> 39:28.858
Puttanesca, do you know
what that means in Italian?

39:30.018 --> 39:31.977
It means whore.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.660
Seriously, that's what it
means, whore's pasta.

39:35.338 --> 39:37.537
My ex-wife used to love it.

39:37.538 --> 39:39.818
I guess that should
have been a sign, huh?

39:45.378 --> 39:46.418
Here...

39:48.418 --> 39:49.458
Here, try some.

39:52.258 --> 39:54.137
Mm! It's good.

39:54.138 --> 39:55.540
- Yeah?
- Mm.

40:03.644 --> 40:04.684
Here.

40:07.218 --> 40:08.740
Have this.

40:17.058 --> 40:18.098
Come on!

40:19.058 --> 40:20.777
Come on!

40:20.778 --> 40:21.818
We're celebrating.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.258
Cheers!

40:31.498 --> 40:33.377
In Nigeria, we say...

40:50.471 --> 40:51.511
Good girl.

41:07.138 --> 41:08.978
Here we go!

41:41.651 --> 41:45.211
- Hello.
- Tosh! Is everything OK?

41:45.236 --> 41:50.820
I heard you had a rubbish day, so I
come bearing gifts, pizza and wine?

41:52.618 --> 41:53.857
Brilliant!

41:53.858 --> 41:56.177
Sorry, come in, come in.

41:56.178 --> 41:57.857
How did you know where I live?

41:57.858 --> 42:00.217
I'm kind of a detective Donnie.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.700
Right. Oh, well, that'll
explain it, then.

42:23.018 --> 42:24.058
Quiet night.

42:25.018 --> 42:26.978
I had a session with Chris.

42:28.498 --> 42:30.577
Didn't know you guys were so pally.

42:30.578 --> 42:32.178
Not as pally as you and his wife.

42:35.818 --> 42:38.657
Saw you two in the pub tonight.

42:38.658 --> 42:42.937
Luckily, I got Chris out of there
before he clocked you.

42:42.938 --> 42:46.178
So you owe me for that wee
favour, Jimmy boy.

42:48.338 --> 42:49.777
We were just talking.

42:49.778 --> 42:50.818
Good.

42:51.778 --> 42:54.337
Because there's no profit
in womanising, Jimmy,

42:54.338 --> 42:57.180
you just end up on your own
with everybody hating you.

43:01.098 --> 43:03.674
What are you doing with Graeme Benson?

43:03.675 --> 43:04.900
Who?

43:04.901 --> 43:06.700
Hey, Graeme Benson!

43:07.658 --> 43:08.857
Oh...

43:08.858 --> 43:11.940
He's nothing but a Flash Harry.

43:14.178 --> 43:16.980
Well, he was here this afternoon,
intimidating Cassie.

43:17.698 --> 43:18.738
Oh.

43:25.418 --> 43:26.698
Are you working with him?

43:27.778 --> 43:29.417
No. No.

43:29.418 --> 43:31.300
Don't lie to me, Duncan.

43:32.458 --> 43:34.498
I'm not lying.

43:34.860 --> 43:36.577
I don't know the guy.

43:36.578 --> 43:39.138
Well, then, what was he doing
here this afternoon?

43:40.458 --> 43:41.498
Duncan?

44:14.378 --> 44:17.578
This is music! Yeah!

44:19.698 --> 44:21.458
Proper music!

44:32.978 --> 44:35.137
This music's old.

44:35.138 --> 44:38.497
Play something that makes us happy. Hm?

44:38.498 --> 44:39.900
Want to see how we go?

44:41.898 --> 44:43.377
You like dance music?

44:43.378 --> 44:44.418
Yes.

44:47.618 --> 44:49.537
OK!

44:49.538 --> 44:51.218
Give me that one.

45:13.258 --> 45:17.097
OK! Remember this one?

45:17.098 --> 45:18.618
What the hell's going on here?!

45:31.618 --> 45:34.097
I was just having some dinner.

45:34.098 --> 45:35.578
Are you stupid or something?

45:41.298 --> 45:43.140
Put them back in the room!

45:46.658 --> 45:48.340
You're not my boss.

45:53.390 --> 45:54.683
In the room!

46:50.458 --> 46:53.217
- Oh, you're up!
- And you're playing Runrig.

46:53.218 --> 46:54.937
Don't bad-mouth the Rig!

46:54.938 --> 46:56.857
I've got nothing but love for them.

46:56.858 --> 46:57.898
Good girl.

46:58.898 --> 47:00.737
Yeah, so I wanted to make
you some breakfast,

47:00.738 --> 47:02.897
but, well, things got a bit smoky.

47:02.898 --> 47:03.938
Hence the mask.

47:05.618 --> 47:06.857
Sensitive eyes.

47:06.858 --> 47:07.898
It's a burden.

47:09.098 --> 47:10.457
Do you have any coffee?

47:10.458 --> 47:12.937
There's a jar by the kettle there.

47:12.938 --> 47:14.777
You got any real stuff?

47:14.778 --> 47:16.497
I'll get it for next time.

47:16.498 --> 47:17.538
Next time?

47:19.178 --> 47:22.097
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean it like that.

47:22.098 --> 47:23.976
I'm not presuming. I wouldn't.

47:23.977 --> 47:26.377
I just meant I'll get
some in case you visit.

47:26.378 --> 47:27.580
Instant's fine.

47:30.538 --> 47:32.137
So, ketchup or brown sauce?

47:32.138 --> 47:33.737
Oh, neither.

47:33.738 --> 47:35.018
I don't eat sausages.

47:36.698 --> 47:39.860
Oh, sorry, I didn't realise.

47:41.218 --> 47:42.578
You'll know for next time.

47:57.618 --> 47:59.818
Christ, Andy!
Have you been here all night?

48:01.338 --> 48:03.178
Didn't see much point in going home.

48:04.618 --> 48:06.458
It's not like I'm getting any sleep.

48:09.218 --> 48:11.218
Managed to find anything on the CCTV?

48:12.818 --> 48:13.985
Well,

48:15.065 --> 48:18.017
whoever attacked the Dunwoody house,
they didn't come through Lerwick.

48:18.018 --> 48:19.978
I've checked all the traffic cameras.

48:21.898 --> 48:26.137
So, I figured, maybe they came
the long way around,

48:26.138 --> 48:27.257
the South Road.

48:27.258 --> 48:29.337
Do we have any cameras on the South Road?

48:29.338 --> 48:30.857
No.

48:30.858 --> 48:33.177
But the petrol station does.

48:33.178 --> 48:34.500
I found this.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.338
Taken on the day of the attack.

48:41.538 --> 48:42.820
Is that your woman?

48:45.178 --> 48:46.380
Pause it there.

48:46.938 --> 48:48.100
Zoom in.

48:53.898 --> 48:55.300
That's Andrea Doyle.

48:56.258 --> 48:59.340
The car is registered to an Angela Dale.

49:00.218 --> 49:02.617
Yeah, that's too close
to be a coincidence.

49:02.618 --> 49:04.218
I'll see if I can get an address.

49:09.818 --> 49:12.057
45 quid for a week's shop?

49:12.058 --> 49:14.257
Can't survive on beans and soup.

49:14.258 --> 49:15.937
- Says who?
- Says me.

49:15.938 --> 49:19.537
Oh, so you're the boss now, eh?

49:19.538 --> 49:21.220
Aye, I'm the boss.

49:24.658 --> 49:25.698
Come on.

49:37.458 --> 49:41.857
So, an Angela Dale rented a flat
in Lerwick four weeks ago.

49:41.858 --> 49:43.497
The landlady's meeting us there.

49:43.498 --> 49:44.538
OK.

49:50.418 --> 49:52.603
- Is she in?
- Nobody's answering.

49:55.418 --> 49:56.458
Thanks.

50:01.378 --> 50:02.418
Check the bedrooms.

50:26.858 --> 50:27.898
Sand!

50:43.298 --> 50:45.537
Right, pull on forensics
at the Dunwoody place and get

50:45.538 --> 50:46.578
them down here.

50:51.778 --> 50:53.177
What's happened?

50:53.178 --> 50:55.217
We found Andrea Doyle.

50:55.218 --> 50:56.937
Or where she's been staying, at least.

50:56.938 --> 50:58.137
What about the girls?

50:58.138 --> 50:59.538
No, there's no sign of them.

51:00.618 --> 51:01.658
Sir?

51:05.018 --> 51:06.058
That's her.

51:07.978 --> 51:09.085
Cut her off, Tosh.

51:42.738 --> 51:43.778
Watch out!

52:44.338 --> 52:45.378
Really?

52:54.858 --> 52:57.860
Tosh, get her.

53:02.658 --> 53:03.698
Come on.

53:09.378 --> 53:10.898
- OK?
- Yeah.

53:17.778 --> 53:18.818
Watch your legs.

53:20.258 --> 53:21.298
OK?

53:22.938 --> 53:24.098
- Thanks.
- There you are.

53:29.018 --> 53:30.058
Rosie!

53:34.338 --> 53:35.698
- No! No!
- Argh!

53:42.098 --> 53:43.380
Jamie!

53:53.418 --> 53:57.017
Sir, the search team found
the petrol can and the rags

53:57.018 --> 53:58.220
in the boot of her car.

54:27.738 --> 54:28.778
Hey.

54:41.658 --> 54:42.698
Niki?

54:48.458 --> 54:49.498
Niki?

54:52.858 --> 54:53.898
Niki?

54:58.178 --> 55:00.657
Niki? Niki?!

55:00.658 --> 55:02.137
Niki!

55:02.138 --> 55:03.380
Niki!

55:07.498 --> 55:08.537
No!

55:13.818 --> 55:15.857
Where are you taking me?

55:15.858 --> 55:17.940
Please, just stop the car, OK?

55:31.938 --> 55:36.780
No, don't even think about it.
Don't think about it!
