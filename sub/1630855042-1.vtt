Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

08:47.699 --> 08:49.736
I appreciate the love y'all got
for my boy Dicky, man.

08:49.736 --> 08:52.240
I've been trying to get him
out here on this stage tonight,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.579
but he on some
Carmen Sandiego type shit.

08:54.579 --> 08:56.850

my friends, but I just...
- Oh.

12:00.216 --> 12:01.853
I've never heard of you.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.525
Honestly, I prefer that.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.161
Like, great. It's good

12:06.161 --> 12:08.299
that you have a clean slate
on my personality.

12:08.299 --> 12:10.771
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm a-I'm a rapper,
actually, not a singer.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.209
I do sing,
song-write, all that.

12:13.209 --> 12:15.881
Oh, you did that song
about being drunk.

12:15.881 --> 12:17.317
What was... what was it called?

12:17.317 --> 12:19.254
- It was...
- "I'm Drunk."

12:19.254 --> 12:21.292
Oh, yeah, well, I'm on my way.

12:21.292 --> 12:23.229
You... pig.

12:23.229 --> 12:24.532
(laughs)

12:24.532 --> 12:27.505
I don't know.
So, what's your deal--

12:27.505 --> 12:29.341
you just go to live music venues

12:29.341 --> 12:32.080
without even knowing who
the person is and you have fun?

12:32.080 --> 12:35.219
Wednesdays are like my Fridays.
I'm a nurse, so...

12:35.219 --> 12:37.223
- Ah. A nurse?
- Yeah. Had to

12:37.223 --> 12:39.261
come blow off some steam,
you know?

12:39.261 --> 12:40.965
I appreciate everything
you do, uh,

12:40.965 --> 12:43.503
behind the scenes
for all the sick.

12:43.503 --> 12:45.874
- Thank-thank you.
- Yeah. But okay,

12:45.874 --> 12:48.045
I can't go any further
without knowing your name,

12:48.045 --> 12:49.782
- so...
- Oh, it's Campbell.

12:49.782 --> 12:51.118
Campbell?

12:51.118 --> 12:52.220
Yeah, like the soup.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.057
That's a perfect name.

12:54.057 --> 12:55.561
- Thanks?
- Campbell,

12:55.561 --> 12:57.865
can I ask you a relatively
hard-hitting question?

12:57.865 --> 12:59.134
Yeah.

12:59.134 --> 13:00.470
What's your availability

13:00.470 --> 13:02.374
as far as being
hit on right now?

13:02.374 --> 13:04.946
(chuckles)
Uh...

13:04.946 --> 13:07.083
Like, would you say you're
open-minded, or not at all?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.087
Uh...

13:09.087 --> 13:12.360
Yeah, I think I, uh... I'm...

13:12.360 --> 13:14.532
I'm definitely open to it.

13:15.534 --> 13:17.838
This is fun.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.176
ELZ:
People are actually crazy.

13:20.176 --> 13:22.314
They were literally
pouring tequila in their eyes.

13:22.314 --> 13:26.523
Like, why? I wish I had, like,
40 cameras. I keep missing shit.

13:26.523 --> 13:28.827
Just ask them to redo it.

13:28.827 --> 13:31.198
I can't do that for my doc.
It's not real.

13:31.198 --> 13:34.939
Real? None of this is real,
Emma. Are you crazy?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.943
- What...
- We're on tour right now.
Tour's not real.

13:36.943 --> 13:39.481
When we come to town, it's like
their version of the Super Bowl.

13:39.481 --> 13:42.253
Okay, Mr. Big Shot
Who's Been On Tour.

13:42.253 --> 13:44.057
Do you not understand
that white people act out

13:44.057 --> 13:45.326
when they see a camera?

13:45.326 --> 13:48.099
- What?
- Trust me. Come on.

13:49.502 --> 13:51.973
- EMMA: Wait...

13:51.973 --> 13:54.344
- White boy summer!
- White boy summer!

13:54.344 --> 13:56.549
(overlapping shouting)

13:56.549 --> 13:58.419
Then I'm gonna continue
to smoke this joint, then.

13:58.419 --> 14:00.223
- All right.
- Oh, hi, man.

14:00.223 --> 14:02.160
MAN:
LD!

14:02.160 --> 14:03.930
Thank you.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.400
Does that get annoying?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.638
It's just praise. It's...
All it is is praise.

14:07.638 --> 14:10.476
- Okay.
- But it's the life I chose.

14:10.476 --> 14:12.447
- Yeah.
- I always wanted
to be ubiquitous.

14:12.447 --> 14:17.323
Well, uh... good luck,
and you have a new fan,

14:17.323 --> 14:19.261
and I really hope
that you make it.

14:19.261 --> 14:21.331
- Get this out of here.
- (laughs)

14:21.331 --> 14:22.635
You're saying goodbye?

14:22.635 --> 14:24.237
- Well...
- You're not about to leave.

14:24.237 --> 14:26.275
- Uh...
- You can't be. You're not gonna

14:26.275 --> 14:27.878
let something like this
totally evaporate.

14:27.878 --> 14:29.615
No. No, no, no.
I'm engaged.

14:29.615 --> 14:31.385
- Oh, of course you are.
- No, no, no.

14:31.385 --> 14:33.155
No, no, no!
No, no, like... (laughs)

14:33.155 --> 14:36.328
Like, I'm engaged
in the conversation.

14:36.328 --> 14:38.065
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:38.065 --> 14:39.502
So, a bunch of us are gonna
go to my friend Connor's.

14:39.502 --> 14:41.105
He's having
a little get-together.

14:41.105 --> 14:42.608
- Oh.
- You want to come?

14:42.608 --> 14:44.979
'Cause I like
hanging out with you.

14:44.979 --> 14:47.317
I like hanging out
with you so much.

14:47.317 --> 14:50.123
- All right.
- I do have a tour bus

14:50.123 --> 14:52.528
- parked half a block away.
It's so charming.
- Oh, no.

14:52.528 --> 14:55.901
I'm-I'm not, like, a groupie.
I'm just a regular girl.

14:55.901 --> 14:59.007
Of course you are.
I respect that.

14:59.007 --> 15:00.978
- We'll go to... Connor's?
- Yeah, Connor.

15:00.978 --> 15:02.313
Okay. I have to grab something
off that bus.

15:02.313 --> 15:04.284
- Will you stay here?
- Yeah.

15:04.284 --> 15:05.954
Okay, because, in my opinion,
I feel as though

15:05.954 --> 15:08.359
this is what life is all about--
moments like this.

15:09.161 --> 15:11.499
- (laughs)
- We'll
figure something out
later, but yeah.

15:11.499 --> 15:13.436
- We'll figure it out.
We'll work on it.
- Okay. All right.

15:13.436 --> 15:16.676
SCRO-GUY:
You're getting ready
to have a blast,

15:16.676 --> 15:19.715
but you're not sure
about someone's sexual past.

15:19.715 --> 15:24.324
Part of the skin of
your genital area has a cover,

15:24.324 --> 15:27.297
but most is still exposed
to your lover.

15:27.297 --> 15:29.234
Not anymore.

15:30.671 --> 15:32.975
Now there's Scroguard.

15:32.975 --> 15:37.585
The powerful new product that
you can wear with any condom.

15:37.585 --> 15:40.256
The secret is
the high-quality premium latex

15:40.256 --> 15:42.595
that is thick enough
to cover your genital area

15:42.595 --> 15:45.466
- but thin enough
to feel like a second skin.
- (mutters)

15:45.466 --> 15:47.403
Just fasten any two buttons

15:47.403 --> 15:49.575
securely into place,
and when you're ready...

15:49.575 --> 15:52.080
Hey, Dave...
Oh, shit!

15:52.080 --> 15:55.153
- Oh!
- Geez. (stammers) Uh...
No shitting on the bus!

15:55.153 --> 15:56.689
No, I'm not-I'm not shitting!

15:56.689 --> 15:58.527
I'm just fixing my pants.

15:58.527 --> 16:01.431
I changed my underwear
'cause I met a girl

16:01.431 --> 16:03.335
and I was talking to her,
and I-I, like,

16:03.335 --> 16:05.373
soaked my first underwear
with pre-cum.

16:05.373 --> 16:08.012
- Okay.
- I-I met a girl.

16:08.012 --> 16:10.383
Uh, congratulations, man.
I'm happy for you.

16:10.383 --> 16:12.020
- Wish me luck.

like, a rapist?

16:39.509 --> 16:41.445
No, no.
It was actually my goat.

16:41.445 --> 16:43.315
My goat got out of its pen.
It was, like, ramming its horns

16:43.315 --> 16:45.319
- against the glass. Ramming...
- Wait, hold it. You have a goat?

16:45.319 --> 16:46.723
- Like, you're a goat owner?
- Mm-hmm.

16:46.723 --> 16:48.325
Yeah, I got a bunch of goats.

16:48.325 --> 16:50.731
You're, like, out of a fable.

16:50.731 --> 16:52.668
Hey, you're the fucking GOAT,
LD. Come on.

16:52.668 --> 16:55.473
- Hey, y'all, shut the fuck up!
- Thank you, bro.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.343
Sorry.
Don't even look at that.

16:57.343 --> 16:59.347
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- He's fine. Oh.

16:59.347 --> 17:01.118
- Get in here.
- (laughs)

17:01.118 --> 17:02.755
Wow, you just broke
the touch barrier.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.625
- (laughing)
- So nonchalantly,

17:04.625 --> 17:06.529
you're just gonna break it
like that, and not even... Wow.

17:06.529 --> 17:08.733
- I mean, someone had to.
- I'm totally on board
with it, FYI.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.471
- Um...
- Oh, my God.

17:14.277 --> 17:15.814
I have to pee.

17:15.814 --> 17:18.085
Yeah.
I understand that.

17:18.085 --> 17:20.356
I've had to pee in the past, and
you never know when it's coming.

17:20.356 --> 17:22.528
- Thank you. All right.
- Yeah. I'm right there with you.

17:22.528 --> 17:24.097

17:45.807 --> 17:47.645
What?

17:49.414 --> 17:51.385
You like Ram?

17:51.385 --> 17:54.257
R-Ram?
Uh, do I like what?

17:54.257 --> 17:56.194
- Uh...
- What do you mean? Like the...

17:56.194 --> 17:58.465
- Like the processing power?
- CONNOR: It's...

17:58.465 --> 17:59.802
the L. A. Rams.
Like, Los Angeles Rams.

17:59.802 --> 18:02.307
- Like, uh, football team.
- Oh, shit.

18:02.307 --> 18:04.444
Is he okay, or is he on,
like, Oxys or something?

18:04.444 --> 18:07.283
- CONNOR: No, no. I mean...
- Is this Appalachia
that we're in?

18:07.283 --> 18:09.555
'Cause I know all about the
opioid crisis that you probably

18:09.555 --> 18:10.824
have to deal
with at every moment.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.528
I've got molly,
if you want some.

18:12.528 --> 18:15.667
Oh. No, thanks.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.607
It's, like, dark purple.

18:18.607 --> 18:20.544
I'm okay.

18:20.544 --> 18:22.681
I don't even understand the
color spectrum of molly, but...

18:22.681 --> 18:25.821

We haven't met.
- Grace.

18:25.821 --> 18:29.829
- You... Race?
- Hey, are you hiring,
by the way, LD?

18:29.829 --> 18:33.469
- No.
- Um, I majored
in-in golf course management.

18:33.469 --> 18:35.507
- Uh-huh.
- Um, but there's a lot

18:35.507 --> 18:37.645

- Yeah, I think

18:37.645 --> 18:39.849
you're better off on the greens
there, 'cause, like,

18:39.849 --> 18:43.255

- No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.625
Yeah.

like, shit's like way
more popping, you know? Like...

18:48.700 --> 18:50.202
- No.
- It's pretty low-key,
'cause it's Wednesday night

you mean,
you said it was her mission?

21:00.564 --> 21:03.469
- Like, going into the night?
- Yeah.

21:03.469 --> 21:05.607
Then why did she tell me
when I met her

21:05.607 --> 21:07.443
that she had never heard
of Lil Dicky?

21:07.443 --> 21:09.615
- (laughing)
- Oh, is that what she told you?

21:09.615 --> 21:10.984
She probably just said that

21:10.984 --> 21:12.788
'cause she's watched
all your interviews.

21:12.788 --> 21:14.492
She knows that's
what you want to hear.

21:14.492 --> 21:18.398

she knew what to tell you.

Yes.

Uh, I'm sorry.

21:41.478 --> 21:43.550
Or congrat...

21:43.550 --> 21:44.885
I don't know what
to say to that.

21:44.885 --> 21:46.889
Tell us what it's like.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.360
Just tell us what
it's really, really like.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.033
- It's not like anything, man.
- MATTY: Yeah, man,

21:52.033 --> 21:54.939
do the girls just
fap for you, nonstop?

21:54.939 --> 21:57.376
Fap?

21:59.949 --> 22:04.558
- All right, sit down.
- (laughs) Okay. All right.

22:04.558 --> 22:05.927
- You guys want
to know what it's like.
- Oh, fuck, yeah.

22:05.927 --> 22:07.531
I'll tell you
what it's really like. Yeah.

22:07.531 --> 22:09.668
Here's what it's like.
I go around America

22:09.668 --> 22:11.906
and I meet people like you,
and every single time,

22:11.906 --> 22:13.442
they look at me exactly the way

22:13.442 --> 22:14.945
you guys are staring
at me right now.

22:14.945 --> 22:16.983
It's weird. And people
have preconceived notions

22:16.983 --> 22:19.555
about the way that I behave,
about the way that I fuck.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.559
(sputters)
I feel that.

22:21.559 --> 22:23.596
Fucking ain't easy, broham.

22:23.596 --> 22:26.969
Not easy at all. I've had so
many insane sexual encounters.

22:26.969 --> 22:29.875
And truthfully, the thing
that I want the most

22:29.875 --> 22:33.750
is incredibly simple, but
I could never really ask for it.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.820
What?

22:36.622 --> 22:40.429
So, my dick is shaped
like a manatee.

22:40.429 --> 22:41.799
In the sense that, like,
you know how, like,

22:41.799 --> 22:43.736
the manatee is...
have, like, a bend

22:43.736 --> 22:46.107
and, like, a...
So my dick is bent.

22:46.107 --> 22:48.680
The thing that
satisfies me most in life

22:48.680 --> 22:53.155
is when that bend
simply gets straightened.

22:53.155 --> 22:55.627
There's no STD threat whatsoever.

22:55.627 --> 22:58.098
It's truly my heaven on Earth,
but I could never ask for that

22:58.098 --> 22:59.702
because it's so weird,

22:59.702 --> 23:01.639
and the women would
tell all their friends.

23:01.639 --> 23:04.511
But that wouldn't happen
with my soulmate.

23:04.511 --> 23:06.114
I'm looking for love.

23:06.114 --> 23:08.151
I'm looking for my wife, okay?

23:10.523 --> 23:12.594

23:12.594 --> 23:16.602
(chuckles) No.
But you asked me what it's like.

23:16.602 --> 23:17.738
It's not even that interesting.

23:17.738 --> 23:18.706
- It's actually...
- Come on, Dicky.

23:18.706 --> 23:20.042

show it to anybody.

funniest thing you'll ever see.
