00:02.440 --> 00:04.317
Previously on Enterprise:

00:04.440 --> 00:06.510
You, Denobulan, come with us.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.869
A virus is spreading from planet
to planet. Millions are already infected.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.194
What do you want with me?

00:14.320 --> 00:17.790
If this continues,
the Klingon species will cease to exist.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.480
There's a job that needs doing,
Lieutenant.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.160
It may be the only way
to save your friend's life.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.909
You don't seriously expect me
to help you create Klingon Augments?

00:27.040 --> 00:28.189
Take him.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.034
The Malcolm Reed I know would give
his life before committing treason.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.594
There are some obligations...

00:36.440 --> 00:39.512
that go beyond my loyalty
to you and this crew.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.751
-T'Pol to Captain Archer.
-Go ahead.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.475
The warp matrix has been compromised
by a Klingon subroutine.

00:46.120 --> 00:47.792
It's infiltrated our command protocols.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.353
Pressure's increasing again.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.790
-T ake us to warp 5.2.
-Sir, we can't hold that speed for long.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.797
We're out of options, Travis.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.989
5.2.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.917
And now, the conclusion.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

01:12.400 --> 01:15.073
We've 47 minutes
until our reactor breaches.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.514
What did the Klingons do to it?

01:16.640 --> 01:18.631
They altered
our engineering subroutines.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.116
If we go below warp 5,
the reactor's going to explode.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.151
-How can I help?
-I've just been talking with Trip.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.510
Columbia can rendezvous with us
in 30 minutes.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.676
He says he can restore the subroutines.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.473
-He can't do that from Columbia.
-We're gonna bring him on board.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.717
The Transporter won't operate at warp
and docking's out of the question.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.276
Trip told me you have experience
transferring personnel at warp speed.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.676
In training exercises, yes,
but at warp speed 1.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.798
Every move was rehearsed
in simulators for weeks.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.353
We don't have weeks.

01:47.560 --> 01:50.836
We'll have to merge our warp field
with Columbia's.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.473
T'Pol's doing the calculations now.

01:52.600 --> 01:56.036
At warp 5, we'll have to move
within 50 metres of each other.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.390
Has anyone ever done this before?

02:00.320 --> 02:04.154
Travis can handle the flying.
Can you get Trip over here?

02:07.840 --> 02:10.400
You'll have to let me out of this Brig.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.389
It's been a long road

02:18.240 --> 02:19.992
Gettin' from there to here

02:21.360 --> 02:23.351
It's been a long time

02:25.000 --> 02:28.470
But my time is finally near

02:28.880 --> 02:32.236
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:33.040 --> 02:35.998
I will touch the sky

02:36.120 --> 02:39.795
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:39.920 --> 02:42.753
No, they're not gonna change my mind

02:43.080 --> 02:47.517
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

02:47.640 --> 02:50.438
I'm going where my heart will take me

02:50.560 --> 02:54.792
I've got faith to believe

02:54.920 --> 02:57.912
I can do anything

02:58.040 --> 03:02.113
I've got strength of the soul

03:02.240 --> 03:05.277
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:05.400 --> 03:09.598
I can reach any star

03:10.680 --> 03:12.955
I've got faith

03:14.440 --> 03:17.273
I've got faith

03:18.160 --> 03:21.391
Faith of the heart

03:45.400 --> 03:47.470
Commander Tucker,
are you ready for this?

03:50.200 --> 03:52.077
As ready as I'll ever be.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.873
Open a channel.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.920
-Columbia to Enterprise.
-This is Archer.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.429
We're matching speed and trajectory
as requested.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.152
Stand by, Columbia.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.674
Archer to Reed.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.837
-Go ahead.
-We're in position.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.190
Have them start their rotation.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.431
Coming up on 100 metres.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.074
90, 80 metres.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.389
This is the Bridge.
All hands brace for warp field contact.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.033
Hold her steady, Travis...

04:49.160 --> 04:52.311
or Chef will know who to blame
for the mess in the Galley.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.870
We're at 50 metres and holding.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.112
Make sure everything's ready
for Trip in Engineering.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.755
Archer to Reed. You're all clear.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.354
Understood.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.995
Columbia, I'm deploying the tether.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.272
Nice shooting, Malcolm.

05:24.320 --> 05:26.117
Tucker to Captain Hernandez.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.992
-Go ahead.
-I'm heading out.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.196
Quick as you can, Commander.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.235
Never thought I'd see the stars like this.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.114
Eyes on the cable, Commander.
I need you back here in one piece.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.912
You're doing fine, Trip.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.512
T'Pol, what's happening?

06:11.600 --> 06:14.319
I'm reading a fluctuation
in the warp field.

06:14.440 --> 06:17.955
Take power from life support if you
have to, but keep the field constant.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.719
Sir, I'm having trouble holding position.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.519
52 metres, 55.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.757
Don't mean to be a pest, but could
someone tell me what's going on?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.314
You're almost here, Trip. Keep going.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.988
Engineering, report!

06:35.120 --> 06:37.873
I'm re-routing power now, Captain.
Stand by.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.359
59 metres.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.796
The tether's at its limit! Hurry up!

06:51.200 --> 06:54.829
T'Pol to the Bridge. It's not working.
Field is still fluctuating.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.319
Almost there!

07:23.520 --> 07:25.431
Permission to come aboard?

07:30.520 --> 07:33.398
Bridge, I have him.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.311
-You all right, Trip?
-I'll feel a lot better when this is over.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.671
There's only one way to do this,
Captain: a cold start.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.793
I have to shut down the reactor,
and re-set the algorithms.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.672
Once we bring the warp engine
back online...

07:47.800 --> 07:49.791
the subroutines should be
back to normal.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.148
But if we shut down the reactor--

07:51.280 --> 07:53.669
That's why we need to move inside
Columbia's warp field.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.473
They can sustain our speed
while I re-initialise the engines.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.750
They won't be able to hold us
for more than a minute or two.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.394
-They don't have enough power.
-I've got a shortcut in mind.

08:01.520 --> 08:02.509
Shortcut?

08:02.640 --> 08:04.756
Those subroutines
would take hours to decrypt.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.394
Better just to purge them,
wipe them clean.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.640
I'll contact Columbia.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.231
I'll contact Columbia.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.789
What are they here for?

08:20.920 --> 08:23.798
The Captain and I have had
a slight misunderstanding.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.955
How slight?

08:25.080 --> 08:27.640
These gentlemen are here to escort me
back to the Brig.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.753
Don't worry, I'll tell you all about it
when we're not quite so busy.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.433
Fancy meeting you here.

08:39.559 --> 08:43.313
-lntermix pressure?
-1527.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.955
-Field variance?
-87 millicochranes.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.635
Somebody hasn't been taking
very good care of my engine.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.591
Speak with the Klingons.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.711
-What are you doing?
-You might want to take notes.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.832
I'm about to perform a manual shutdown
and re-start in less than two minutes.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.110
-That's not possible.
-Watch me.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.150
-Columbia to Enterprise.
-Go ahead.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.635
I've routed everything I've got
to my warp field.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.638
Do me a favour, Jonathan.
Make this quick.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.113
Archer to Trip.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.435
Ready when you are.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.709
Stand by!

09:21.840 --> 09:25.958
Everyone get away from the bulkheads!
It's gonna get a little hot in here!

09:30.080 --> 09:32.958
Reactor shut down in five, four...

09:33.080 --> 09:35.469
three, two, one!

09:42.720 --> 09:44.199
T'Pol, prime the injectors.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.675
-Jenkins, man the relays.
-Yes, sir.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.317
Columbia to Enterprise.
You've got about 40 seconds.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.114
Understood.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.268
Trip, how's it going?

10:02.400 --> 10:05.710
-Just another minute, Captain.
-You don't have a minute.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.235
Get ready to initialise the matrix!

10:15.560 --> 10:17.915
Enterprise, we're losing the field.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.553
15 seconds, Trip.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.274
Almost there.
Full power to containment.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.714
Fire up the antimatter stream!

10:25.840 --> 10:29.879
Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.989
Commander!

10:31.120 --> 10:33.998
-Here we go!
-Four, three, two.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.472
We've got warp power.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.429
Engineering to the Bridge.
Subroutines have been purged.

10:51.040 --> 10:54.157
-Appreciate the house call, Mr. Tucker.
-Anytime.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.833
I'd like to drop to impulse for a while,
Captain, just to check things over.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.109
Stand by.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.552
Enterprise to Columbia.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.509
Thanks for the lift.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.110
You're not getting away
with my Chief Engineer that easily.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.190
-Any plans for the next few days?
-What've you got in mind?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.149
Phlox.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.319
This will help.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.271
My apologies for the General's conduct.
So cruel.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.994
This is no way to treat
a man of science.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.118
Then end it. Contact Starfleet.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.078
My people need you, Phlox.
We have no healers with your abilities.

11:53.840 --> 11:58.197
You want me to create
Klingon Augments, living weapons.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.469
I won't do it.

11:59.600 --> 12:04.071
No. I've been reviewing your work.
It's brilliant!

12:04.320 --> 12:08.108
You have discovered a weakness
in the virus causing the plague.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.232
If we interrupt
the transcription sequence here....

12:18.640 --> 12:19.629
Yes.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.758
That would stop...

12:24.560 --> 12:27.279
the genetic effects of the virus
in Stage One.

12:27.400 --> 12:31.473
There'd be changes of appearance,
some minor neural reordering...

12:31.600 --> 12:34.717
but no development
of Stage Two characteristics.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.593
No enhanced strength or speed
or endurance.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.197
But then General K'Vagh
would not get his Augments.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.511
He would never allow it.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.671
What if we don't tell him?

12:53.520 --> 12:54.953
Do you understand what will happen...

12:55.080 --> 12:57.799
if the General learns that
we've deceived him?

12:57.920 --> 13:00.912
The cure would save
millions of innocent lives.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.151
What more honourable death
could there be for a healer...

13:05.360 --> 13:07.715
Klingon or Denobulan?

13:15.080 --> 13:17.116
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.073
I've asked Columbia to join us
in our search for Phlox.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.953
We'll have a better chance of making it
through Klingon territory...

13:23.080 --> 13:24.877
with twice the firepower.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.674
I don't suppose you can tell me
where I'm going this time?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.472
No, I didn't think so.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.629
-Those are my personal files.
-Not when they affect my ship.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.998
T'Pol restored everything
you tried to erase.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.077
We ran his face and voiceprint
through our database.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.638
His name's Harris.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.515
He worked in Starfleet Security...

13:58.240 --> 14:00.310
up till five years ago.
After that, his file ends.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.668
Captain...

14:02.320 --> 14:05.118
-there's nothing more I can add.
-I won't accept that!

14:05.240 --> 14:08.710
You endangered every member
of this crew. You answer to me.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.590
I thought I knew you, Malcolm.

14:16.760 --> 14:19.513
Whatever hold this Harris has on you...

14:20.560 --> 14:21.834
you could've come to me.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.838
-I'm under orders.
-I'm your Commanding Officer!

14:26.440 --> 14:28.715
If you don't tell me what's going on,
I'll go to Starfleet.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.752
Whatever you think you've been trying
to keep hidden is going to come out.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.598
Is that what you want?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.795
I can't tell you what I don't know.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.358
Then let me talk to someone who can.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.837
Send a message to Harris.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.757
Has the House of Phlox
always been one of healers?

14:58.400 --> 15:01.472
There is no House of Phlox.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.713
Denobulan family units
are different from Klingons.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.831
Yes, I've heard.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.270
Three wives for each husband.
Three husbands for each wife.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.839
Your mating practices must be
very complex.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.388
Wondrously so.

15:17.320 --> 15:20.915
-What about the House of Antaak?
-We are a warrior caste.

15:22.360 --> 15:26.114
When I became a healer,
my father disowned me.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.398
As a physician in the lmperial Fleet,
you've served in the military.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.556
Not as well as I should have.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.239
I did not screen my subjects properly.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.276
This plague, all its victims...

15:45.520 --> 15:46.919
it's my fault.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.588
My failure is the reason you're here.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.198
The humans could not stop us.

16:08.320 --> 16:11.392
I am your superior. You will salute.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.395
Now, report.

16:19.120 --> 16:22.954
Enterprise was destroyed.
Starfleet will think it was her engines.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.314
One of you is missing.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.113
Your son was slow.
The humans killed him.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.630
Did he die with honour?

16:33.320 --> 16:35.914
He let humans kill him.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.155
Report.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.795
-Dr. Phlox has made excellent progress.
-Details.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.276
I've identified the RNA sequences
that code--

17:01.400 --> 17:04.472
Details I can pass on to my superiors.

17:05.240 --> 17:08.596
I know where to look for the switch
that will turn off the virus.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.314
-How long until you find it?
-An hour.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.069
One hour.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.595
What do you want?

17:22.720 --> 17:25.553
-I have news for the High Council.
-Explain.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.712
The Denobulan is close to perfecting
the Augments' genome.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.990
The Council has shut down your project.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.432
If you sterilise this colony,
then all our research will be lost.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.074
The fleet will reach you in three days.

17:41.200 --> 17:45.910
If you're successful by the time
we get to orbit, Qu'Vat will be spared.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.197
Captain, it's gonna be a while...

18:00.320 --> 18:02.231
before everything's back to normal
in Engineering.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.998
Can Kelby handle it?

18:05.080 --> 18:07.469
I could pull a little double duty
to help him out.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.034
I could check with Captain Hernandez.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.313
Something else?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.868
What the hell's going on with Malcolm?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.470
Nothing I can get into right now.

18:24.840 --> 18:28.116
Fair enough.
Guess I'd better get back to Columbia.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.318
I'll walk with you.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.479
Are you enjoying your time
aboard Columbia?

18:39.600 --> 18:40.749
Sure, why wouldn't l?

18:40.880 --> 18:43.553
You haven't been experiencing
any problems?

18:43.840 --> 18:44.989
Such as?

18:45.800 --> 18:49.236
Adjusting to new food, new routines...

18:50.160 --> 18:51.673
trouble sleeping.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.359
-I sleep just fine. How about you?
-Fine.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.588
-You sure about that?
-Quite.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.559
Your hour is up.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.439
-We are getting the test results now.
-We are running out of time!

19:13.200 --> 19:16.272
General, I know the Klingon fleet
is on its way...

19:16.400 --> 19:20.234
and I understand what this project
cost you, personally.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.712
-Antaak told me about your son.
-He died in combat for the Empire.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.716
At least he was spared the final stage
of this disease.

19:31.640 --> 19:34.473
May I ask how he was infected?

19:35.560 --> 19:37.949
Command chose his unit
for the Augment experiment...

19:38.080 --> 19:40.913
when we had exhausted our supply
of prisoners.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.838
My son was a warrior.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.191
He asked for no special treatment,
and I gave him none.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.751
-What'd they give you?
-It's dead. I can't eat that.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.630
No wonder you're all so weak.

20:04.840 --> 20:08.992
-Physical strength isn't everything.
-Well, you can't win wars without it.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.190
Being smart is more important.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.675
General Sun Tzu said that
the greatest victories...

20:13.800 --> 20:15.233
are those won without fighting.

20:15.360 --> 20:18.716
The great Kahless said
there's no victory without combat.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.433
Do you ever question why you fight?

20:25.560 --> 20:28.279
Soldiers don't question. They obey.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.830
What if your superiors are wrong?

20:31.960 --> 20:35.157
They're imprisoned, or killed.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.276
That's not how we do things in Starfleet.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.392
Which is why the Klingon Empire
will defeat you.

20:43.520 --> 20:47.274
Then how come
you're in the same Brig that I'm in?

20:51.480 --> 20:55.189
You said we'd become stronger.
This is what you've done to us.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.117
He will become infectious
so he should be quarantined.

20:59.240 --> 21:03.119
We'll remain here.
If we're going to die, we'll die together...

21:04.400 --> 21:05.469
as comrades.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.352
Be patient, Lieutenant.

21:07.720 --> 21:10.473
The Denobulan is working to stabilise
the human DNA.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.434
You will all be healthy again,
and stronger than any Klingon.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.919
-Will he restore our appearance?
-I don't know.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.511
How do you expect us to return home
looking like this?

21:22.880 --> 21:26.714
We will be outcasts. There will be
no place for us in the Empire.

21:26.840 --> 21:29.229
Your heart is still Klingon.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.151
Are you certain of that?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.754
During the battle
with the Starfleet ship...

21:36.880 --> 21:40.759
I felt fear for the first time
since I was a child.

21:41.960 --> 21:45.396
I wasn't alone.
I could see it in the eyes of the others.

21:46.720 --> 21:50.349
We've become like them.
Weak, cowardly.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.595
It would be better for us to die.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.070
As long as I draw breath...

21:56.480 --> 21:59.233
the Empire will not turn its back on you.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.434
I get the feeling you miss Phlox, too.

22:11.040 --> 22:15.397
Maybe it's just the stash of cheese
he's got in Sickbay.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.478
Hold that thought.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.276
Captain Archer, I'm told
you have some questions for me.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.716
-Where's my doctor?
-He's safe...

22:26.840 --> 22:29.070
on a mission of great importance
to Starfleet.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.838
Phlox was kidnapped.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.594
Starfleet would never authorise that.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.593
Reread the Charter.
Article 14, Section 31.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.155
There are a few lines
that make allowances...

22:39.280 --> 22:42.750
for bending the rules during times
of extraordinary threat.

22:42.920 --> 22:44.990
-What threat?
- Take your pick.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.391
-Earth's got a lot of enemies.
-Klingons attacked my ship.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.192
Is that what we're talking about?

22:50.320 --> 22:52.880
What I wanna talk about
is Lieutenant Reed.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.230
He's done good work for us
over the years.

22:55.360 --> 22:58.352
Don't be too hard on him.
He was just following my orders.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.948
You put him in an impossible position.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.872
I can understand why you would feel
that way...

23:03.000 --> 23:05.389
but this is bigger than one captain,
and one ship.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.875
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.357
All I can tell you is that if you interfere...

23:10.480 --> 23:12.516
before Phlox completes
his assignment...

23:12.640 --> 23:15.393
the repercussions will affect
entire worlds.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.518
One of these four strains
has the genetic trigger...

23:21.640 --> 23:24.677
that can neutralise the virus
before it advances to its lethal stage.

23:24.800 --> 23:25.869
Which one?

23:26.480 --> 23:29.199
I don't know yet. That's why I have to
check each of them.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.038
How long will it take?

23:32.320 --> 23:33.389
A week.

23:33.520 --> 23:37.069
Your fleet can quarantine this world,
while I complete my tests.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.475
Sterilisation is not necessary.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.433
Fleet Admiral Krell
will not extend his deadline.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.233
The only possible way to get results
on Krell's schedule...

23:45.360 --> 23:47.237
is to infect four healthy Klingons.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.237
You have four right here!

23:49.360 --> 23:53.273
Only one of these strains will work.
The other three will be lethal.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.593
-Ethically, it's unthinkable!
-The ethics, Doctor, are simple.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.634
Three lives to save millions.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.792
At first, it didn't seem like lying.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.674
-What else would you call it?
-Covert operations.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.156
I was a young ensign, it was exciting.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.511
-How do you feel about it now?
-I thought it was done.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.029
This is the first time that
Harris has contacted me...

24:24.160 --> 24:26.196
since I've served on Enterprise.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.276
He told me about the plague.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.153
He said they needed Phlox
to help the Klingons find a cure.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.635
I was supposed to just slow us down.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.830
Did Harris tell you about this?

24:38.760 --> 24:41.433
I had T'Pol take a closer look
at our prisoner's medical scans.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.993
It's human DNA.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.952
I'm guessing the plague is
a side-effect...

24:47.080 --> 24:49.548
of a military experiment
that went wrong.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.999
I didn't know.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.473
Harris claims he's doing this...

24:52.600 --> 24:55.990
because Starfleet needs
a stable Klingon Empire.

24:58.640 --> 25:00.278
Do you believe him?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.558
I don't trust him.

25:04.680 --> 25:08.468
If the Klingons needed our help,
there are easier ways to get it.

25:09.160 --> 25:11.799
I wanted to tell you everything, Captain.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.311
There's a way out of this.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.032
I don't have to put you back in the Brig...

25:20.160 --> 25:23.072
but you have to choose
where your loyalties lie.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.356
I wasn't told where Phlox was taken
but Starfleet lntelligence believes...

25:29.480 --> 25:32.392
the Klingons have
a genetic research facility...

25:32.600 --> 25:34.079
on Qu'Vat Colony.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.599
As you were.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.712
-How long until we reach Qu'Vat?
-Six hours, sir.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.438
Captain, we need to be ready
for Klingon patrols.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.790
I suggest that Columbia withdraws
to a safer distance...

26:10.920 --> 26:13.354
so that we don't make a single target.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.835
Open a channel to Captain Hernandez.

26:17.760 --> 26:21.116
Why did you think you'd succeed
in perfecting Augments...

26:21.240 --> 26:22.912
when Dr. Soong failed?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.235
Soong's mistake
was that he made too few of them.

26:25.360 --> 26:26.839
Earth once had thousands.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.871
They became tyrannical
and started a war.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.673
-Klingons have discipline.
-Augments don't.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.591
Their increased aggression is matched
by their decreased inhibitions.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.598
You'd lose control of them,
just as humans did.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.638
How long until we know
which one of us survives?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.952
An hour, at most.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.955
Would bloodwine affect the results?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.435
I don't believe so.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.312
Then we shall drink...

27:04.160 --> 27:06.799
to the bravery of these warriors.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.957
-Doctor!
-Never on the job.

27:12.760 --> 27:15.991
We know Phlox was taken
to Qu'Vat Colony to work on a cure.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.554
We're gonna be there
in less than an hour.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.069
Krell's patrols will crush you.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.591
They've all been recalled
to enforce quarantine zones.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.709
Phlox will be in the medical facility.
We need the coordinates.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.831
If you don't wanna help us,
help your people.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.639
My brothers.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.160
They're quite ill. So are you.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.439
Try to rest.

27:57.880 --> 27:58.995
Doctor.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.032
The two guards are displaying
the first symptoms.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.798
That accounts for
two of the three lethal strains.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.639
So either General K'Vagh lives, or I do.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.350
It's the General, isn't it?
His strain has the cure.

28:25.560 --> 28:29.120
If we work quickly, there's a chance
we can treat you in time.

28:29.120 --> 28:29.199
If we work quickly, there's a chance
we can treat you in time.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.199
-What now?
-There's been a complication.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.875
Another one?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.275
This time, your people failed
to stop Enterprise.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.709
It's on its way to Qu'Vat, with Columbia.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.752
-Order them to withdraw.
-You know I don't have that authority.

28:52.880 --> 28:56.589
-Then I'll destroy them.
-We had an arrangement.

28:58.320 --> 29:02.871
You did what I wanted.
I don't need you anymore.

29:03.440 --> 29:05.351
You agreed that both our governments
would benefit...

29:05.480 --> 29:07.391
if the two of us worked together.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.080
And you believed me.

29:11.520 --> 29:15.274
Load the amino acids.
I'll extract the viral DNA from his blood.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.311
-Captain.
-You all right?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.790
Better, now that you're here.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.115
Father.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.389
I was told that you had been killed.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.351
-The humans spared me.
-I came to get my doctor back.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.756
-We need him here.
-I have two ships in orbit, heavily armed.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.189
Gentlemen, please.
I think I can speak for myself.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.435
Captain.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.757
I need a little more time
to cure this plague.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.869
Cure?

29:45.360 --> 29:48.238
You were supposed to perfect
the Augment genome!

29:48.360 --> 29:49.509
I lied.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.034
Your son may be alive...

29:51.160 --> 29:54.470
but he will not survive much longer
unless I complete my work.

29:54.600 --> 29:57.672
A few hours, Captain. That's all I ask.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.553
Several million patients are
counting on it.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.595
Commander...

30:02.720 --> 30:05.553
three Klingon battle cruisers
have just dropped out of warp.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.636
Open a channel to Columbia.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.749
The Klingons are jamming everything.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.275
-What is it?
-Krell's ships are here.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.153
Keep working.

30:18.880 --> 30:22.270
Archer to Enterprise.
Tell the Klingons we have the cure.

30:24.680 --> 30:25.999
Enterprise, respond.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.236
This is Fleet Admiral Krell.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.433
I'm under orders
to eradicate this colony.

30:31.600 --> 30:35.036
You don't have to do that.
My doctor can stop the plague.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.913
I have a more effective solution.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.757
Hello, Admiral Krell. This is Dr. Phlox.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.955
I am transmitting the details
of an antivirus.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.594
Feel free to have your physicians
confirm my findings...

30:49.720 --> 30:52.553
and you're welcome to call
with any questions.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.398
My orders are clear.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.193
Captain Archer...

30:56.440 --> 30:59.955
your ships are now the property
of the Klingon Empire.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.589
Stand down or be destroyed.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.677
Proceed as planned.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.150
Leave nothing standing.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.474
The lead ship's moving
into a lower orbit.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.068
-They're charging weapons.
-lntercept course.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.349
Columbia.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.640
-I can't get through.
-They're firing on the colony.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.591
Target their disruptors.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.350
How strong are the shields
around this place?

31:45.480 --> 31:47.038
Not strong enough!

31:47.920 --> 31:49.956
You said you had two ships in orbit!

31:50.080 --> 31:52.389
I'm sure they're doing
everything they can.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.192
Archer to Enterprise.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.151
They're closing from astern.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.479
Aft cannons are down.

32:14.400 --> 32:18.154
Columbia to Enterprise.
Looked like you could use a hand.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.871
Let's keep those ships off their tail.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.390
Your ships are taking damage.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.838
-How much longer?
-As I said, another few hours.

32:30.960 --> 32:34.919
Can you speed that up a little?
Phlox, I've got an idea.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.758
If we wanna get out of here
in one piece...

32:36.880 --> 32:39.997
we've gotta get that cure
and we've got to get it fast.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.831
I could finish the antivirus in less time...

32:44.960 --> 32:48.077
if I had a human host
to replicate enough antibodies.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.039
I don't see any other humans around.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.912
Captain, I would have to expose you
to the plague.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.473
I cannot predict what it might do to you.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.319
-Will it give you the cure?
-Unquestionably.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.158
Let's get started.

33:01.600 --> 33:02.669
What do you intend to do?

33:02.800 --> 33:05.712
This virus may be our best weapon
against Krell.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.512
Ready when you are.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.752
One of the ships is losing power.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.236
-Their port nacelle is vulnerable.
-Then fire at will.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.357
In addition to the virus, I'm injecting you
with a metabolic catalyst...

33:31.480 --> 33:33.072
to accelerate your immune response.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.872
It won't be pleasant.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.715
It's no use.
I can't penetrate their shields.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.230
Commander. I've broken through
their jamming frequencies.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.871
T'Pol to Captain Archer.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.313
Captain, respond!

33:58.880 --> 34:02.190
Doctor Phlox here. The Captain is
indisposed at the moment.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.515
I imagine you have your hands full
up there.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.709
T o say the least.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.353
We have a plan
to defuse the situation...

34:07.480 --> 34:10.516
but we'll need a few more minutes
to carry it out.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.393
I'd appreciate it if you could keep...

34:12.520 --> 34:14.590
the ceiling from caving in
on us until then.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.947
Understood.

34:17.360 --> 34:20.351
-How much hull plating do we have left?
-62%.

34:20.639 --> 34:24.315
Mr. Mayweather, put us directly
between that cruiser and the colony.

34:24.440 --> 34:28.114
You may wanna divert
all available power to our dorsal plating.

34:28.239 --> 34:29.434
Aye, aye.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.918
It's working.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.556
-They're shifting their orbit.
-Stay with them.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.114
-Hull plating's down to 40%.
-Keep firing.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.311
Captain Hernandez, please direct
your weapons at the battle cruiser.

35:07.440 --> 35:10.113
Wish I could help.
We just lost our weapons.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.477
It's done. Hold him.

35:29.240 --> 35:30.639
We've got it!

35:32.600 --> 35:33.749
Is the canister ready?

35:33.880 --> 35:36.235
It's set to disperse five seconds
after transport.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.475
Send it.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.671
Open a channel to Krell.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.519
Hull plating's nearly down.
We can't hold this position much longer.

35:52.600 --> 35:56.195
Admiral Krell, Dr. Phlox again.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.470
By now you may have noticed
the small package...

35:58.600 --> 36:00.670
which we sent to your Bridge.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.472
What you may not know
is that it contains...

36:02.600 --> 36:04.989
a potent sample of the metagenic virus.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.078
Even as we speak,
it is dispersing throughout your ship...

36:08.200 --> 36:11.749
-infecting you and your crew.
-You're lying!

36:12.520 --> 36:13.873
Check your internal sensors.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.036
You will find
that the atmosphere contains...

36:16.160 --> 36:19.118
approximately 20 parts per million
of the viral strain.

36:19.240 --> 36:22.471
Or if you don't trust your sensors,
trust your senses.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.196
You will feel the initial symptoms
in about 30 minutes.

36:26.320 --> 36:28.629
A tightness in the chest,
irregular heartbeat...

36:28.760 --> 36:30.557
tingling in your cranial ridges.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.274
This is a cowardly attack!

36:33.760 --> 36:37.355
Maybe so.
But I am prepared to give you the cure.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.438
Thanks to Captain Archer, I have
managed to complete the antivirus.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.279
Of course,
if you destroy this colony, well...

36:43.400 --> 36:46.392
treating you and your crew
could prove difficult.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.912
I suggest you power down
your weapons, Admiral...

36:50.040 --> 36:52.031
and let me cure your people.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.831
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.996
Admiral Krell has convinced
the High Council...

37:03.120 --> 37:05.634
to call off their sterilisation programme.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.034
They've promised to distribute
Phlox's cure throughout the Empire.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.837
There's no trace of the virus
in your bloodstream.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.508
My targ won't even recognise me.

37:18.520 --> 37:22.035
In the future, it may be possible
to reverse the cosmetic effects.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.390
I suppose this is what I deserve.

37:25.840 --> 37:30.391
Millions of my people will have to live
with this disfigurement.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.750
It'll be passed on to our children.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.233
Life won't be easy for us.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.510
You did your best
to correct your mistakes.

37:37.640 --> 37:39.198
That's all we can ask of ourselves.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.835
I doubt my superiors will allow me
to remain in my position.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.035
I'll need to find a new speciality.

37:48.760 --> 37:51.479
Perhaps cranial reconstruction.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.677
I have a feeling that's about to become
very popular.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.749
I'm grateful for everything
that you've done.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.508
How are you feeling?

38:13.640 --> 38:16.473
Not too bad,
aside from some strange cravings.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.517
A plateful of live gagh
sounds pretty good right now.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.999
The cravings should disappear
in a day or so, along with your ridges.

38:25.280 --> 38:29.512
No, I'd keep them if I were you, Captain.
It makes you look intimidating.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.672
I should get back on the road.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.439
One of us needs to get
some exploring done.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.873
Thanks for your help.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.390
I don't know how you survived
all these years without me.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.239
Shouldn't you be joining her?

38:45.360 --> 38:48.477
I asked Trip to stick around for a little
while to help us out with repairs.

38:48.600 --> 38:49.669
Indeed.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.953
Our new Chief Engineer will no doubt
be delighted for the help.

38:53.080 --> 38:57.198
No, Kelby's got nothing to be
worried about. I'm only here temporarily.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.913
-What do you want?
-I called to thank you.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.671
Everything went
according to our projections.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.631
The Empire's been stabilised.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.193
I doubt very much
they'll be experimenting...

39:22.320 --> 39:24.276
with Augments any time soon.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.789
We could've explained everything
to Captain Archer.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.911
That's not how Krell
wanted things done.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.237
Since when do we do things the way
the Klingons want?

39:32.480 --> 39:33.959
When it's in our interest.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.911
I had to keep certain details from you
as well.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.315
I hope there are no hard feelings.

39:38.720 --> 39:41.837
This mission wouldn't have succeeded
without you, Lieutenant.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.838
Don't ever contact me again.
Is that clear?

39:46.360 --> 39:48.954
Maybe you didn't understand
our recruitment policy.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.559
You can't simply walk away.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.639
I answer to one Commanding Officer,
Jonathan Archer.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.751
Lieutenant, why don't we--
