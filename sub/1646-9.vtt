WEBVTT

00:01.042 --> 00:02.627
Previously on Prison Break...

00:02.711 --> 00:03.628
What do you want with Scylla?

00:03.712 --> 00:05.839
Same thing you want:
bring down the Company.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.298
We need the pages.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.633
Are we partners?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.510
Partners.

00:10.593 --> 00:12.470
So your brother told me
about your nosebleeds.

00:12.554 --> 00:13.847
I'm fine.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.306
You don't look fine.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.100
Sorry.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.268
Consider this a warning.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.522
Linc, pull back!

00:22.605 --> 00:23.773
It's a trap!

00:25.275 --> 00:27.777
You all right?!
Damn, you're hit!

00:32.490 --> 00:33.575
All right, all right.

00:33.658 --> 00:34.993
You'll get your shot,
now back off!

00:35.452 --> 00:38.079
This is an attempt on my card.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.330
How do you
want to proceed?

00:39.414 --> 00:40.290
I want it moved.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.042
Move Scylla.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.418
Now!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.845
Now, tell the General
you killed us.

00:53.928 --> 00:57.057
Otherwise, my hand, it ain't
going to get tired.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.769
I just hope
your mouth gets tired.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.773
That's funny.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.527
Come on, buddy, come on.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.988
Enough already,
come on, Linc.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.619
Believe me now?

01:17.702 --> 01:19.496
Beating him isn't
going to work, Lincoln.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.290
We tried your way.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.709
We want General Krantz
to think Wyatt took us out.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.545
Even if you do break him
and he does call the General,

01:27.629 --> 01:29.380
you don't think a
trained military veteran

01:29.464 --> 01:31.674
is going to hear
the fear in his voice?

01:31.841 --> 01:34.219
They're going to know
he was coerced.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.722
Yeah, well, I need some
more time with him.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.975
I hear you, Linc, but he can't make the
call if he's unconscious.

01:41.059 --> 01:41.976
However we do it,

01:42.393 --> 01:44.062
we better get what
we need from Wyatt soon,

01:44.145 --> 01:47.148
because Mahone...
ain't going to wait.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.280
I'm trying to find the son
of a bitch who killed my kid!

01:58.159 --> 01:59.911
Lisa, what are
we looking at?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.705
Initial estimate is three days
to complete the move of Scylla.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.790
Unacceptable.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.753
Respectfully, this is not
as simple as unplugging

02:08.837 --> 02:10.839
a laptop and moving it
to another room.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.465
The data on Scylla
is too delicate.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.675
I don't want excuses.

02:13.758 --> 02:17.303
All I care is that it's
done right and done right now.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.056
I understand the urgency,
but it will take three days.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.350
And if I may speak freely,
I think it's a mistake

02:22.433 --> 02:24.144
to move Scylla
to the Raven Rock bunker

02:24.227 --> 02:25.478
when the Los Angeles facility

02:25.562 --> 02:27.313
is one of the most
secure ones we have.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.149
The most secure
location we have

02:29.232 --> 02:30.775
is the one they
don't know about.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.819
Sir...

02:32.902 --> 02:33.862
Still no word
from Wyatt.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.155
He only uses
the company-issued cell,

02:35.238 --> 02:36.656
so we can't track him.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.032
We have no way of confirming

02:38.116 --> 02:39.617
if he successfully
completed his operation.

02:39.701 --> 02:40.827
Keep calling him!

02:40.910 --> 02:41.911
And draft
a press release,

02:41.995 --> 02:43.371
photographs,
criminal records,

02:43.454 --> 02:45.999
everything we have on Scofield,
Burrows, all of them.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.625
Tell our friends in
the media I want them

02:47.709 --> 02:49.794
to saturate the evening news
and the morning papers.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.254
I want it impossible for them

02:51.337 --> 02:54.674
to walk down the streets of Los
Angeles without being spotted.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.725
I assume we haven't
made much progress

03:03.808 --> 03:05.059
with our friend
over there?

03:05.143 --> 03:06.060
Any suggestions?

03:06.561 --> 03:07.812
How about we talk to him?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.606
Great, want to give him some
milk and cookies

03:09.689 --> 03:11.566
while you're at it?

03:11.649 --> 03:13.985
No. How about just
some nice conversation?

03:57.737 --> 03:59.072
Hmm.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.242
So they sent
Florence Nightingale

04:02.325 --> 04:06.204
to get me all ready
to cooperate.

04:06.287 --> 04:08.248
Actually, I'm here to help you,
despite what you've done.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.083
Because I'm still a doctor
and you're a prisoner.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.542
You're going to save me?

04:12.835 --> 04:13.920
Don Self has
a metal case out there

04:14.003 --> 04:15.088
and I don't know
what's in it.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.798
I imagine you don't
want to find out,

04:16.881 --> 04:18.675
so I figure if you
and I had a talk...

04:18.758 --> 04:21.177
You'd make me see the light.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.180
If you don't call the General,
you're as good as dead.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.432
I've already been
a lot of things

04:26.516 --> 04:29.727
worse than dead
in my life, Doctor.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.315
You better have more than that to
threaten me with.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.112
Come on, Mike,
she's okay.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.780
He's a professional killer.

04:40.863 --> 04:41.864
Don't worry, he's locked up.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.157
Let's go.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.995
Come on,
let's go!

04:47.078 --> 04:49.622
So what'd you do
with Roland's body?

04:49.706 --> 04:50.707
Roland?

04:51.374 --> 04:53.459
He's been, uh, reconfigured

04:53.543 --> 04:55.295
and given a permanent
resting place.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.046
Good. Take his bowling shirts

04:57.130 --> 04:59.173
and the rest of his crap
with you when you leave.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.550
Come on, Linc, the guy died.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.219
He died a punk!
He ratted us out, Bellick.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.221
You guys, you deal
with the matter at hand.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.309
Assuming these pages
are correct,

05:09.392 --> 05:11.811
and there's no way of knowing
that they actually are...

05:11.894 --> 05:14.814
we follow this basement hallway
through the boiler room to here.

05:14.897 --> 05:16.649
There's some kind of
elevated walkway.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.026
We follow that to the end,

05:18.109 --> 05:19.694
and we've covered most
of the distance

05:19.777 --> 05:22.155
between GATE and the Company's
headquarters.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.990
What's this thing at
the end of the walkway?

05:24.073 --> 05:26.326
I don't know. Whistler
marked it with an "X"

05:26.409 --> 05:29.287
so I'm thinking it's some kind
of wall or serious impediment.

05:29.370 --> 05:30.997
That's why we're going
down there prepared.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.374
Tools, thermal lances,
sledgehammers...

05:33.458 --> 05:35.084
Okay, so we get
through that wall...

05:35.168 --> 05:36.169
what's on the other side?

05:36.252 --> 05:37.712
Again, I don't know.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.048
It's because Gretchen
has the rest of the pages.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.507
But once we're through
this location,

05:41.591 --> 05:43.593
we can't go any further
until she gives them back.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.927
What's her game in all this?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.388
I mean, if she wants the
Company to go down,

05:47.472 --> 05:48.848
she should just
give us the pages.

05:48.931 --> 05:49.932
Look, we're going
to deal with Gretchen

05:50.016 --> 05:52.101
when the time is right, okay?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.062
You guys need to go to GATE
and get started.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.063
I'm going to stay
here with Wyatt

05:55.146 --> 05:56.481
and make sure we
get what we need.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.404
No more dawdlin' now.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.697
Move your ass.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.866
High gear, gentlemen, high gear.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.118
My boss will be here any minute.

06:12.455 --> 06:17.251
I assume I don't have to mention
that discretion is paramount.

06:17.335 --> 06:21.214
In other words,
silence is golden.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.716
You just make sure you stay
in your office

06:23.800 --> 06:25.259
and you keep other people out.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.803
Oh, I'll stay
in my nice,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.054
air-conditioned
office, Pretty.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.681
And you can crawl down
into your little hole now.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.308
Go on.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.313
Go ahead, crawl.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.864
Cole? What the hell
is going on here?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.242
Mr. White, are
you back already?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.911
-How are you?
-Fine, until I found a resignation fax

06:51.994 --> 06:54.372
waiting for me
from Andrew Blauner.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.500
A resignation?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.252
Yeah, I can't get him
on the phone,

06:59.335 --> 07:00.503
I reached out
to his fiancée,

07:00.586 --> 07:01.879
she hasn't seen
or heard from him.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.714
She's worried sick.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.758
He's probably on
a bit of a bender,

07:05.842 --> 07:06.968
just sleeping it
off somewhere.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.928
Blauner? He's a Boy Scout.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.430
None of this makes
any sense, Cole.

07:11.889 --> 07:13.099
But I'll tell you what,

07:13.182 --> 07:14.600
I'm going to look into it.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.397
Let me know if I can be
of any assistance.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.357
-Good morning, Mr. White.
-Good morning.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.202
What is that sound?

07:45.965 --> 07:46.883
Yeah?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.509
I hope you're having

07:48.593 --> 07:49.552
a lovely, enjoyable morning,

07:49.635 --> 07:51.137
because while you are
nowhere to be found,

07:51.220 --> 07:52.388
there is sleuthing
going on here

07:52.472 --> 07:54.765
regarding the whereabouts
of one Mr. Andrew Blauner.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.100
And?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.810
And if I'm going down
for this little homicide,

07:57.894 --> 07:59.020
I ain't going alone.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.897
We're going together
like traffic and weather.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.106
Relax, okay?

08:02.190 --> 08:04.901
They'll never find
the body where I put it.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.070
Now, where are
Scofield and Burrows?

08:08.154 --> 08:09.947
Just doing their end
of the bargain.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.366
Which begs the question,
what the hell are you doing?

08:13.367 --> 08:14.327
Me?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.958
I'm getting ready for a meeting.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.005
So, your friends
have been calling a lot.

08:26.088 --> 08:28.049
They must be wondering
where you are.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.009
That's right.

08:30.092 --> 08:32.970
They're wondering,
and the longer they do,

08:33.054 --> 08:34.347
the more danger
you're in.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.766
Call the General, and say what
they want you to say.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.851
And what?
You'll let me go?

08:38.935 --> 08:41.020
No, but Don Self
will make sure

08:41.103 --> 08:42.188
that you spend the rest
of your life

08:42.271 --> 08:44.524
in a decent facility
without the death penalty.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.818
Either way,

08:47.902 --> 08:50.112
if I make the call
or not,

08:51.447 --> 08:52.490
I'm dead.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.200
You know that.

08:54.283 --> 08:57.912
And we both know
that you, as a doctor,

08:57.995 --> 08:59.747
won't let that happen.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.250
So, please,

09:02.333 --> 09:03.834
let's you and I figure a way

09:03.918 --> 09:08.130
out of this mess
that works for everybody.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.407
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

09:34.490 --> 09:37.076
Sit your ass down!
Get out of my way!

09:37.159 --> 09:39.662
I will cuff your ass
to that table, okay?

09:40.496 --> 09:41.831
All right,
I know this is hard.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.040
And I know
what you want to do.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.667
Okay, but I'm trying
to do something here

09:44.750 --> 09:46.377
and you need to deal
with that reality.

09:46.502 --> 09:47.670
Have you lost a kid?

09:47.753 --> 09:49.005
Yeah, I did, too.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.549
My wife was pregnant.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.803
And there were complications
and the doctor messed up.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.221
And she...

09:57.972 --> 09:59.432
And they both...

10:00.850 --> 10:02.268
They didn't make it.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.853
Okay? So I understand.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.024
What would you do
if you were me

10:08.107 --> 10:10.318
and that man
was right there?

10:10.901 --> 10:12.028
What would you do?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.696
I don't know
what I would do.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.073
Look, I'm giving you my word.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.951
When the time is right,
I won't stand in your way.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.830
When the time is right
I won't let you.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.290
-Okay.
-Okay?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.417
Did you see the way
Mahone was looking at Wyatt?

10:26.959 --> 10:27.960
The guy is hurting.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.421
It was more than just
hurting, that's pain.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.381
I never cared about
anything like that.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.383
I look at what I've
done with my life,

10:34.467 --> 10:37.219
beating on cons at Fox
River, chasing money,

10:37.303 --> 10:39.388
trying to keep my own
ass out of prison.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.223
This the pathway
you talking about?

10:41.307 --> 10:42.516
According to the map,

10:42.600 --> 10:44.560
this runs almost
the length of that courtyard.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.812
It should put us directly
beneath Company headquarters.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.981
Shh, listen.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.316
There it is again.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.818
What's that noise, Scofield?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.403
I don't know.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.989
Okay, just so we're clear,
we get to go up that ladder

10:57.073 --> 10:59.241
towards a noise
that we don't know what it is.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.411
But if we're lucky,
we get to basically just

11:02.495 --> 11:04.080
walk smack into the Company?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.414
Sounds about right.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.500
You up for it?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.170
Oh, yeah. After you.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.467
I am no different
than that man

11:16.550 --> 11:19.720
over there...
who wants to kill me.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.349
Alexander Mahone was
forced to do things by the Company,

11:23.432 --> 11:24.684
and so was I.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.769
But I know people.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.646
People in government.

11:28.729 --> 11:32.233
People that can help
you and Michael.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.944
I can give you
a phone number.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.488
Arrangements can be made.

11:37.571 --> 11:39.657
All you have to do is trust me

11:40.282 --> 11:43.160
and this will all be over.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.133
It is over.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.600
Has, um, White had anything
new to say about Blauner?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.978
No, but he might.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.732
Mr. Pfeiffer?

12:15.818 --> 12:17.737
That would be moi.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.113
Detective Connor Mara.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.073
I was hoping I could talk to you
about Andrew Blauner.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.159
Of course.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.326
Great.

13:01.655 --> 13:02.865
It's down this way.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.811
This is it!

13:31.894 --> 13:34.355
This is where the sound
was coming from.

13:34.438 --> 13:38.150
It's one of the main conduit pipes
for the LA water supply.

13:39.360 --> 13:43.989
30,000 gallons of water
rushing through this very spot.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.325
Every second.
Oh, great!

13:46.408 --> 13:47.952
There's got to be some other way
to get around it,

13:48.035 --> 13:49.328
some other pathway
or something.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.539
No, we took the only
pathway down,

13:51.622 --> 13:52.957
and it leads right here.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.250
How about over it?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.669
We can't risk tunneling
too close to the surface.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.337
What do we do?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.299
We dig.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.302
Truth be told, uh,

14:05.386 --> 14:07.263
Mr. Blauner isn't officially
a missing person,

14:07.346 --> 14:09.932
but his fiancée has a cousin
at the mayor's office

14:10.015 --> 14:11.767
so, here we are.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.102
Here we are.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.436
Hey, that's not to say
though that there

14:14.520 --> 14:15.771
aren't some things that concern me.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.066
Really? Such as?

14:19.149 --> 14:21.735
Well, the fax that came
into White's office

14:21.819 --> 14:23.779
came from a copy shop,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.906
but Blauner had a fax
machine at his house.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.242
Okay.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.827
And about a half hour
after he resigned,

14:29.910 --> 14:31.370
his car was seen leaving
the GATE garage.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.539
Now, the driver
couldn't be identified,

14:33.622 --> 14:35.708
but it appeared as
though a woman's hands

14:35.791 --> 14:37.835
were seen gripping
the steering wheel.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.169
Let me stop you right there.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.964
It always seemed to me
that Mr. Blauner was,

14:42.047 --> 14:44.008
how can I
put this delicately,

14:44.091 --> 14:46.051
um, a swordsman.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.303
You know what I mean?

14:48.053 --> 14:49.555
Actually, I don't.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.893
He might be dipping his snout
into a different trough,

14:53.976 --> 14:56.395
and the fiancée
is none the wiser.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.983
From what I've, uh, heard about
him from his other co-workers,

15:01.066 --> 15:02.318
that doesn't sound too likely.

15:02.401 --> 15:05.487
If you don't mind me asking, what is
that banging noise?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.531
That's, uh...

15:07.615 --> 15:08.991
it's trouble with the pipes.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.493
You know, they loosened up,
in this, uh, moderate quake

15:11.577 --> 15:14.663
and now they shake more
than the trembler itself.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.123
Mr. Pfeiffer, uh,
some people here

15:16.206 --> 15:17.917
have told me that you and Blauner
didn't get along.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.377
Would you mind talking to me
a little bit about that?

15:22.546 --> 15:24.924
A few years ago, a partner
of mine did this same move

15:25.007 --> 15:26.508
against an enemy combatant
we picked up

15:26.592 --> 15:29.803
at the New Mexico border.
This guy didn't want to talk,

15:29.887 --> 15:31.847
he didn't know anything.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.516
It worked then,
it should work now.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.818
Is that ambulance
you got us still out back?

15:44.902 --> 15:46.612
Yeah.

15:57.414 --> 16:00.668
Hey, come on, pal, I got
almost a decade on you,

16:00.751 --> 16:01.835
and you don't see me
sucking air.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.337
I got shot, Brad.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.880
Oh, yeah.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.423
Guys, we ain't making
any progress here.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.217
There's nothing beneath
this cement but granite.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.511
We couldn't get through
it with a jackhammer.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.221
Maybe we should go back
to the warehouse,

16:12.304 --> 16:13.222
find another way.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.557
There is no other way.
This is it!

16:15.641 --> 16:18.227
This is where the plans lead. This is
our way to Scylla.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.353
What?

16:19.436 --> 16:22.147
We got millions of gallons
of water in this drainpipe.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.358
We can't go under it,
we can't go over it.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.275
I know.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.486
But maybe we
can go through it.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.506
It's loose!

16:50.259 --> 16:53.887
All right, Linc,
this ought to do it.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.764
After I'm done, how
much time we got?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.599
Not a lot.

16:57.683 --> 16:58.809
Be careful.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.227
You, too.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.405
When I was a little boy,
I had an old tomcat named Rufus.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.950
He was a good mouser.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.328
Tough as nails,
solid feline all around.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.539
One day, I bring home
this little kitty

17:20.622 --> 17:23.125
from a giveaway box
outside the Pic 'N Save.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.086
Old Rufus didn't
like that one bit.

17:26.170 --> 17:29.298
He arched his back,
hissed like a rattlesnake

17:29.381 --> 17:32.134
and sprang out his claws
like a switchblade.

17:32.217 --> 17:35.054
You know,

17:35.137 --> 17:37.473
That new little kitty
didn't do nothing wrong

17:37.556 --> 17:38.807
but be new.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.726
Now, that's all I did.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.811
I was being new,
and Blauner was being

17:42.895 --> 17:45.314
this old tomcat
spraying his territory.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.191
Now, I don't hold that
against him.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.360
If he didn't protect his turf
I'd question his character.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.197
But aside from a little
jealousy on his part,

17:53.280 --> 17:55.908
our issues were
as thin as tissues.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.534
I assure you that.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.538
Detective, I pulled
Blauner's travel schedule

18:01.622 --> 18:03.082
as per your request.
Thank you.

18:04.041 --> 18:04.958
Uh,

18:05.042 --> 18:06.418
what's this?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.379
Uh, sir, uh,
we need to step out

18:09.463 --> 18:11.965
for a few more bracket-joints
for the shelving.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.384
Uh, all right, yeah.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.137
But I ain't paying
you to stop for, uh,

18:17.221 --> 18:19.723
a coffee and donuts, so
get back here toot sweet.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.351
Hey, wait up, Manuel.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.687
I hired some men, uh, out of
my own pocket of course,

18:25.771 --> 18:27.231
to, uh,
add some built-in uh,

18:27.314 --> 18:29.566
uh, storage in my closet.
I hope you don't mind.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.652
No.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.280
Here's the monthly breakdown
of where he traveled...

18:41.620 --> 18:43.163
You're gonna
talk to me now?

18:43.247 --> 18:44.915
Me? No.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.458
We're done talking...

18:47.459 --> 18:48.544
But you're not.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.174
They are all dead. It's over.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.094
This will all be over.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.055
This will all be over.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.935
They are dead.
They are all dead.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.895
It's over.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.649
I'm going to take this.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.614
Self...

19:21.535 --> 19:23.287
Can you take a walk?

19:24.037 --> 19:26.999
Yeah.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.007
Come on, Sara,
we should go.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.428
Let's go outside.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.827
My son's autopsy report
said that he'd...

20:03.911 --> 20:05.787
that he'd been shot twice.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.081
Once in the stomach...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.004
Why, man?

20:16.173 --> 20:18.842
Why?! Just to
terrify my wife?!

20:25.057 --> 20:27.684
And then a full
five minutes later,

20:28.644 --> 20:30.354
right in the...

20:34.107 --> 20:37.069
You, too, will suffer.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.073
And when...

20:41.156 --> 20:43.242
and when you can't
stand the pain any more,

20:45.869 --> 20:48.163
you'll make
a phone call for me.

20:48.288 --> 20:51.792
You know, Scofield said
that torture wouldn't work

20:51.875 --> 20:53.627
because the General would hear
the fear in your voice.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.295
But the thing is...

20:57.422 --> 20:58.799
I want the person
on the other end

20:58.882 --> 21:00.467
of my call
to hear the fear

21:00.968 --> 21:02.302
in your voice.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.017
Press release, sir.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.852
In short, it sets
forth that members

21:10.936 --> 21:12.813
of the Fox River Eight
and their accomplices

21:12.896 --> 21:14.648
are alive and well
in Los Angeles.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.116
Where have you been?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.576
They are all dead.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.788
-It's over.
-Good work.

21:29.871 --> 21:32.249
Your payment will be left
where we arranged.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.676
This is no longer necessary.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.765
Go ahead.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.436
The access code

21:52.519 --> 21:53.812
to the covert entrance

21:53.895 --> 21:55.981
is still both your
daughters' birthdays.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.358
Everyone leave us alone.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.820
I said

22:02.529 --> 22:05.282
everyone leave us alone.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.617
It's okay.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.080
She won't hurt me.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.051
Lisa...

22:37.856 --> 22:39.316
I knew you'd come home.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.994
So, how are you
holding up, you know,

22:51.078 --> 22:52.329
not being with
LJ and all?

22:52.913 --> 22:56.083
Good, he's a smart kid.
He can look after himself.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.460
I can see it, how much
you love him.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.171
My dad died when
I was a little kid.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.340
But he was a good father.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.134
Let's just focus and get
this thing done, all right?

23:11.515 --> 23:12.891
Michael said
the manual override

23:12.974 --> 23:15.060
should be somewhere
near the main conduit.

23:15.143 --> 23:17.312
This look like the
main conduit to you?

23:18.021 --> 23:19.689
One way to find out.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.661
That look like it
to you?

23:32.744 --> 23:33.662
Looks like it.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.913
Fire it up.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.802
All right, let's
get out of here.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.720
Hurry up, bro!

23:50.804 --> 23:52.722
Almost done, buddy.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.724
All right, ease it back.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.074
It worked.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.162
How long we got?

24:15.662 --> 24:17.330
I don't know.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.376
Water cut off to
thousands of people.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.837
The city will probably have that
taken care of in about an hour,

24:23.920 --> 24:26.840
which means we've got...
sixty minutes

24:26.923 --> 24:29.009
to do ninety minutes
worth of work.

24:29.676 --> 24:31.845
Or we don't get to Scylla.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.858
What's wrong, papi?

24:48.820 --> 24:50.071
Hey,

24:53.617 --> 24:56.703
Michael! Michael!

24:56.786 --> 24:58.330
What's wrong, papi?

24:58.413 --> 24:59.623
Papi, talk to me!

24:59.706 --> 25:01.750
What's wrong?!
Talk to me!

25:01.833 --> 25:02.876
Michael!

25:04.085 --> 25:05.795
Michael, what's wrong?

25:06.963 --> 25:08.089
Michael!

25:15.847 --> 25:17.516
You want some water?

25:17.599 --> 25:19.100
I'm okay.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.479
You're a lot of things
right now, my friend,

25:22.562 --> 25:24.022
and okay ain't
one of them.

25:24.105 --> 25:28.902
You know, I may not
be the smartest guy,

25:31.404 --> 25:32.822
but I hear things.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.033
Sara and your brother

25:35.116 --> 25:39.454
have been talking about you
not feeling well or something.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.123
Look, I'm just,
I'm just saying.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.800
I need your help.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.386
So, please,
just, uh...

25:56.137 --> 25:57.264
cover for me.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.392
You got it, bro.

26:11.444 --> 26:15.949
Truth is, Gretchen, I know you
better than you know yourself.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.537
So you keep telling me.

26:20.620 --> 26:23.665
When I first met you,
you were a twenty-year-old girl

26:23.748 --> 26:26.376
who'd just been dumped
by the Wheeling Police Academy

26:26.459 --> 26:29.170
for failing her
psych evaluation.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.382
But where those good old
West Virginia boys

26:32.465 --> 26:35.093
could only see
an emotional disconnect

26:35.176 --> 26:38.388
with traces of
sociopathic tendencies,

26:38.471 --> 26:41.891
I saw a Machiavellian streak

26:41.975 --> 26:44.603
that would make
failure an impossibility.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.563
I had to let Wyatt
do what he did

26:46.646 --> 26:48.398
because I needed to know...

26:50.859 --> 26:53.570
what my little bulldog
may have known

26:53.653 --> 26:56.156
about Whistler
and his plans for Scylla.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.201
I told you that
I knew nothing.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.622
You should have believed me.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.999
I knew you'd never
take it personally,

27:06.958 --> 27:11.338
because you are,
and have been

27:11.421 --> 27:13.214
ever since I took you
under my wing...

27:16.509 --> 27:17.719
my girl.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.652
My girl.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.829
The most sensitive nerve endings
are right here.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.415
That's why acupuncturists
avoid placing needles

27:47.499 --> 27:48.667
anywhere near them
because opening up

27:48.750 --> 27:50.377
the nerve endings
in the fingertip...

27:51.211 --> 27:52.796
even a little pinprick...

27:52.879 --> 27:55.256
can result in quite
a painful hot flash.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.843
So a five inch needle

27:58.927 --> 28:01.179
being driven up the
length of the finger...

28:05.266 --> 28:08.395
can make your insides
feel like they're on fire.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.355
Another fact of physiology,

28:10.438 --> 28:13.608
the human body when in extreme
duress begins to shut down.

28:13.692 --> 28:17.737
Brain activity decreases
and your heart rate slows

28:17.821 --> 28:19.989
until you just can't
feel the pain any more.

28:20.073 --> 28:22.617
And that's where the heart monitor and
the battery come in.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.994
'Cause when your heart
rate dips below fifty,

28:25.078 --> 28:27.372
that battery will give
you a wake-up call,

28:27.455 --> 28:29.040
preventing your body
from shutting down.

28:29.124 --> 28:33.086
And then you will
feel every ounce...

28:33.169 --> 28:35.171
of the pain.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.300
And that's when you're going to
beg me to make the phone call.

28:52.772 --> 28:55.024
What can I do you for?

28:55.108 --> 28:57.193
I... I found
some more inconsistencies

28:57.277 --> 28:58.695
in your sales reports.

29:08.079 --> 29:08.955
Listen up here.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.373
From that little
computer of yours,

29:10.457 --> 29:13.418
can you access
into GATE's records?

29:13.501 --> 29:15.879
If I access the network
as an administrator,

29:15.962 --> 29:18.381
I can see the files
in a non-PDF format.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.884
I don't know what that means,
but I assume it was a yes.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.969
So you let your fingers do the
walking across that keyboard

29:23.052 --> 29:24.596
and you get me
my sales records.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.930
You are hurting my arm.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.099
And don't make me hurt
any more of you.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.309
Now, go.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.956
That's good work.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.387
Here.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.854
I need you to
measure this hole.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.692
And then make one
of the same size in the wall opposite.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.402
How?

30:22.320 --> 30:23.780
You got a belt?

30:51.391 --> 30:52.809
We have less
than thirty minutes

30:52.892 --> 30:55.395
until this pipe is flooded
with water again.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.052
Acceptance is
important, Wyatt.

31:28.177 --> 31:30.930
I had to accept
that my son is gone.

31:31.472 --> 31:33.641
And you have to accept
that your life,

31:33.725 --> 31:37.937
your very, very short
life-span ahead of you

31:38.021 --> 31:40.481
is just going to be filled
with agonizing pain.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.860
At least until you do

31:43.943 --> 31:45.570
what I've
asked of you.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.946
And then...

31:47.280 --> 31:49.198
then the pain will go away.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.502
We're running out of time!

32:05.506 --> 32:07.300
-Aw, man.
-What's wrong?

32:07.717 --> 32:09.135
The stupid thing is empty!

32:12.055 --> 32:13.181
All right.

32:13.848 --> 32:15.433
I'm coming in.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.199
You can't do this, bro.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.326
Just finish it.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.419
Hello?

32:43.628 --> 32:45.296
It's me.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.173
What's going on?

32:47.256 --> 32:49.467
Somebody needs to
tell you something.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.807
You call her by
her first name.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.940
Pam...

33:08.236 --> 33:12.907
I'm... sorry.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.247
It's over.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.083
And I love you.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.587
I love you.

33:49.902 --> 33:51.487
This thing is heavy!

33:51.571 --> 33:52.572
Hey!

33:52.655 --> 33:55.074
Sure, show up when all
the hard work is done.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.243
All right, ease it back.

33:57.326 --> 33:59.537
We heard on the radio
that DWP is going to have

33:59.620 --> 34:01.164
the water running
in ten minutes.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.877
You all right?

34:08.504 --> 34:09.714
The sleeve is too heavy

34:09.797 --> 34:11.257
to just slide it
through the pipe.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.218
Two of us are going to
have to go inside

34:14.302 --> 34:15.428
and guide it
through that other hole.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.055
That pipe can flood
at any time.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.390
I'll do it.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.433
I'll go, too.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.018
No.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.186
I'll go.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.937
Oh, no offense, college boy,

34:25.021 --> 34:26.189
but this sucker's heavy.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.107
You're going to need
a little bulk down there.

34:28.816 --> 34:30.109
All right.

34:32.528 --> 34:34.572
Use this to brace the sleeve

34:34.655 --> 34:36.449
when you pull it through
to the other side.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.701
And, uh...

34:39.827 --> 34:41.996
let's get the hell
out of there, all right?

34:49.712 --> 34:51.464
How's Emmy?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.174
I didn't come here
to listen to you

34:53.257 --> 34:54.717
pretend to care about her...

34:55.843 --> 34:56.928
or me.

34:59.347 --> 35:02.350
I came here to tell you
that I'm a free agent now.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.561
The community we run with know
that I'm alive and available.

35:08.314 --> 35:11.609
I can just as easily work for
one of them as I can for you.

35:11.692 --> 35:14.153
So the question is,
what's your offer?

35:14.237 --> 35:16.739
Actually, the question
for you is,

35:16.823 --> 35:19.200
why would you want
to go anywhere else?

35:19.283 --> 35:21.327
It's not a time for
grudges, Gretchen.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.162
It's a time for
coming together.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.624
The salad days are
fast approaching.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.668
Laos worked perfectly.

35:28.751 --> 35:31.587
Soon the populace
will turn to us.

35:31.671 --> 35:33.464
the leaders
of the military,

35:33.548 --> 35:36.300
finance and energy,
to right the ship.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.677
And then...

35:37.760 --> 35:40.721
we'll rebuild this country
in our own image.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.308
And when we do, I want you
there beside me, Gretchen.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.019
As my number two,
like I always promised.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.480
What about Lisa?

35:49.564 --> 35:51.107
I've already told you.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.569
You're my girl.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.624
Come on.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.255
Over there.

36:21.470 --> 36:22.930
Right up there.

36:35.109 --> 36:36.652
You and I are the same,

36:37.111 --> 36:38.529
Alex.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.115
I've done things...

37:01.469 --> 37:05.014
- Push!
- Keep going, keep going!

37:07.475 --> 37:09.602
Keep going! Keep going!

37:09.685 --> 37:11.229
Yeah, it's good right there.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.230
You got it?

37:12.313 --> 37:13.481
That's it.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.233
I don't know how long
that's going to hold.

37:21.155 --> 37:23.908
All we got to do is
pull this thing through and we got it.

37:23.991 --> 37:25.534
All right, guys, push!

37:28.621 --> 37:29.997
Oh! It broke!

37:30.081 --> 37:31.499
The beam, it broke!

37:42.510 --> 37:43.928
Mr. White...

37:45.012 --> 37:47.640
I'm sorry to bother you,
but, uh, after my talk

37:47.723 --> 37:51.310
with Detective Mara, I was
thinking about Mr. Blauner

37:51.394 --> 37:52.937
and some of the
conversations we had.

37:53.020 --> 37:54.981
Salesmen are a lot
like fishermen, right?

37:55.064 --> 37:57.108
Always bragging
about their big catch.

37:58.359 --> 38:01.362
Well, Andy never talked
about his sales,

38:01.445 --> 38:02.989
no matter how much I pried.

38:03.072 --> 38:07.535
So I took the liberty
of... looking them up.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.873
And there were,
to say the least...

38:14.333 --> 38:15.876
irregularities.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.672
T-BAG
Good afternoon to you, too, Andy.

38:19.755 --> 38:22.383
Two of your top buyers
don't have valid

38:22.466 --> 38:23.467
Social Security numbers.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.886
I checked out the
Social Security numbers

38:25.970 --> 38:29.223
of the clients he allegedly
sold GATE workshops to.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.602
In some cases the numbers
are just pure fabrications.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.771
But the checks
must've cleared.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.607
He's must've been money
laundering for God only knows

38:38.691 --> 38:39.984
what kind of
criminal exploits.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.320
The point is...

38:42.403 --> 38:45.823
if the good officer gets his hands on
these papers, you know

38:45.906 --> 38:48.784
you're going to be up to your
eyeballs in IRS auditors.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.414
I suggest you
go tell Mr. Mara

38:53.497 --> 38:55.374
that you found
some irregularities

38:55.458 --> 38:57.543
in Blauner's expenses.

38:57.626 --> 39:01.213
Writing off
personal matters, et cetera.

39:01.297 --> 39:04.216
This will explain
why he disappeared

39:04.300 --> 39:06.093
and will placate
the po-po.

39:07.261 --> 39:08.679
O- Okay.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.438
Listen, Detective,

39:17.521 --> 39:20.107
we've discovered some
discrepancies...

39:20.191 --> 39:22.234
Pick it up! Pick it up!

39:22.318 --> 39:23.736
I can't, it's too heavy!

39:25.029 --> 39:26.530
The brace must have snapped.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.032
Let's try and get it up!

39:29.116 --> 39:30.368
It's not moving!

39:32.203 --> 39:33.579
The water's coming.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.748
The water's coming! Come on!

39:37.458 --> 39:39.168
We got to leave it there.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.003
But then we'll
never get Scylla.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.463
We don't have a choice.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.133
You don't, I do.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.218
What the hell
are you doing?

39:48.761 --> 39:50.721
What the hell
are you doing?

39:50.805 --> 39:53.140
Brad, don't
do this! Brad!

39:57.228 --> 39:59.146
Grab it,
grab it, now!

39:59.980 --> 40:01.232
The water's coming!

40:01.315 --> 40:02.650
Get your ass
in here, now!

40:03.859 --> 40:05.319
Come on, come on!

40:07.655 --> 40:08.989
You hear that?

40:10.449 --> 40:12.451
They're flooding the pipe.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.286
Linc! Get out of there!

40:14.370 --> 40:16.038
It's too loud,
he can't hear you!

40:16.872 --> 40:18.791
Linc!

40:18.874 --> 40:20.668
Come on, man, there's
still enough room

40:20.751 --> 40:21.877
for you to fit
through the hole.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.421
I let go of this
you could drop it.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.089
It's too heavy!

40:26.090 --> 40:28.426
Brad, drop the sleeve

40:28.509 --> 40:29.885
and get out of there!

40:33.013 --> 40:34.056
Don't do this.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.224
You have a son!

40:36.183 --> 40:38.185
Don't do this.
Don't do this!

40:38.519 --> 40:39.603
Push it!

40:39.687 --> 40:41.272
Push it, Scofield!

40:41.355 --> 40:43.524
Come on, push it through!

40:45.901 --> 40:47.069
Push!

40:48.028 --> 40:49.697
Push it!

40:52.908 --> 40:54.827
Push it! Push it!

40:56.912 --> 40:59.290
Brad! Brad, no!

41:00.666 --> 41:02.209
Brad, no!

41:02.877 --> 41:03.919
Brad!

41:04.003 --> 41:05.212
Brad...

41:05.296 --> 41:06.922
Brad, no!

41:08.507 --> 41:10.009
Brad!

41:15.222 --> 41:17.057
Brad!

41:50.883 --> 41:52.468
You can all come back in now.

41:52.551 --> 41:53.886
Everything's fine.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.096
It always was.

41:56.430 --> 41:57.598
You okay?

41:57.973 --> 41:59.141
Couldn't be better.

41:59.225 --> 42:02.186
More important:
what's happening with Scylla?

42:02.269 --> 42:03.812
I'll tell you in private.

42:03.896 --> 42:06.065
You can tell me
in front of Gretchen.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.486
Not until I say
something else.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.739
If you ever come near him
with a gun again...

42:13.822 --> 42:15.032
You'll what?

42:16.784 --> 42:18.035
That will do.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.665
Scylla.

42:23.582 --> 42:25.709
We got preliminary
safeguards in place

42:25.793 --> 42:27.753
faster than we expected.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.630
We could move Scylla
tomorrow if we wanted,

42:29.922 --> 42:33.300
but now that Wyatt's eliminated
Scofield and Burrows,

42:33.592 --> 42:35.302
there's no need.

42:36.595 --> 42:38.222
Scofield and Burrows
are dead?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.266
Dead as Latin.

42:41.475 --> 42:43.102
Go ahead
with the plan.

42:43.185 --> 42:44.770
If a couple of boys
from Illinois

42:44.853 --> 42:46.605
could get that close,
it's time to mix things up.

42:47.022 --> 42:52.403
I want Scylla out of Los Angeles
by the end of the day tomorrow.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.374
He wouldn't climb up.

43:09.837 --> 43:11.005
He just wouldn't climb up.

43:11.338 --> 43:12.715
Where does that pipe
lead to?

43:12.798 --> 43:14.842
-Maybe we can follow...
-No.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.262
No, he's gone.
