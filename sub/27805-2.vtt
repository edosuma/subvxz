WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:04.569
Good morning, beautiful.

00:04.613 --> 00:06.441
I think I might've messed up
the coffee again.

00:06.484 --> 00:08.008
Oh, come on, Clem.
I'm sure it's fine.

00:13.230 --> 00:16.755
That is delicious.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.801
[clicks tongue]
Aw...

00:18.844 --> 00:20.150
Nick, your mom is so adorable.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.673
She keeps texting me asking

00:21.717 --> 00:23.762
if I have the guest list
to the wedding.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.982
That woman is obsessed with
sending out save the dates.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.637
Unfortunately,
she calls them STDs.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.989
Oh... that explains
her other text.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.208
Yeah.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.687
Have you guys seen the OJ?

00:35.731 --> 00:38.081
I swear I left the carton
on the couch last night.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.169
Uh, yeah, you did.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.344
I put it back
in the refrigerator,

00:40.388 --> 00:41.345
you know,
to keep it refrigerated.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.694
My bad.

00:42.738 --> 00:47.047
It's Gucci.
Just don't mess with my system.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.005
"My system"?
Juice on the couch?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.180
Dishes everywhere?

00:50.224 --> 00:53.444
That's a broken system.She's 16.

00:53.488 --> 00:56.056
And up until a week ago,
she was living with my dad.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.536
He never taught us things
like putting away dishes

00:58.580 --> 01:01.931
or, you know,
eating off of dishes.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.802
You know what?
I'll talk to her.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.630
Even though she does not respond
to criticism well.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.154
There's a good chance
she's gonna kill me,

01:07.197 --> 01:08.416
hide the body,
and my face is gonna end up

01:08.459 --> 01:10.026
on a milk carton
that she left out.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.160
Yo, Shannon,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:13.203 --> 01:15.510
You got to do something about
your medicine cabinet.

01:15.553 --> 01:18.948
The funnest thing you have
in there is Claritin.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.517
Look, Shannon,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.475
now that you're living here,
which we are so excited about--

01:24.519 --> 01:27.783
I mean, I know I am--

01:27.826 --> 01:30.002
it'd be great if you
could try to keep the
place a little tidier.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.309
Tidier?Yes, tidier.
Like that plate--

01:32.353 --> 01:33.963
when you're finished with it,
what are you gonna do with it?

01:34.006 --> 01:36.139
I don't know, probably
leave it here, walk away.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.010
If anyone asks, say it's Clem's.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.144
I'll put it this way:
if you don't start

01:41.188 --> 01:42.972
putting the dishes
in the dishwasher,

01:43.015 --> 01:44.930
I'm gonna change
the Wi-Fi password.

01:44.974 --> 01:48.195
Mm-hmm, yeah.I cracked your ATM code.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.588
I'm pretty sure
I can hack your Wi-Fi.

01:50.632 --> 01:51.720
You did what?

01:51.763 --> 01:53.852
Don't worry.
I changed it.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.158
To what? Your birthday?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.162
I'll change it again.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.078
Look, Shannon,
we're not asking for a lot.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.558
We just want you to do
a little bit more

02:03.601 --> 02:04.733
than you're doing
right now,

02:04.776 --> 02:07.649
which is...
absolutely nothing.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.565
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.958
[ringtone playing]

02:13.002 --> 02:14.134
Oh, hey, girl.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.265
Talk to me.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.398
Uh, uh, excu--
excuse me, Shannon?

02:17.441 --> 02:18.877
Shannon? Plate.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.879
Oh, I think that's Clem's.
Sorry, I'm...

02:22.446 --> 02:24.448
♪

02:29.279 --> 02:31.499
Rose, that pot roast
was amazing. Do you mind

02:31.542 --> 02:33.109
if we take a little bit of it
home with us?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.980
Why would you want to
take the pot roast home?

02:35.024 --> 02:37.026
There's, like, zero pot in it.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.812
Of course you can.

02:40.856 --> 02:42.118
In fact, take it all.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.164
Walt and I can't eat it,
that's for sure.

02:44.207 --> 02:47.471
Seriously? I got 11 hours
of televised golf this weekend

02:47.515 --> 02:50.039
and half a gallon
of gravy. I mean,

02:50.082 --> 02:52.172
take it, Clem, we insist.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.654
I'll go put it
in some Tupperware.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.003
Ooh...Ooh...

02:58.047 --> 03:00.702
You have no idea
what you just signed up for.

03:00.745 --> 03:03.008
That woman
is a Tupperware hawk.

03:03.052 --> 03:04.706
[laughs]:
What does that mean?

03:04.749 --> 03:07.709
She is gonna ride your ass
till you return it.

03:07.752 --> 03:08.840
Mm-hmm.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.102
I don't understand.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.234
She said it was fine.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.801
Of course she did.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.890
She's an incredibly
generous host.

03:14.933 --> 03:15.978
But when it comes
to her Tupperware,

03:16.021 --> 03:17.632
that woman
is like Liam Neeson

03:17.675 --> 03:18.850
and those little
glass containers

03:18.894 --> 03:21.723
are like her
abducted daughters.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.160
Ah, here you go.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.641
Just return this to me
any old time.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.121
[Nick and Walt laugh]

03:29.165 --> 03:32.734
Before I forget,

03:32.777 --> 03:35.389
I was going over the guest list
for your wedding,

03:35.432 --> 03:38.130
and there seems
to be a mistake.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.523
You left your father off.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.264
Oh, yeah, no,
that's not a mistake.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.092
I was just worried
that if we invited him,

03:43.135 --> 03:44.746
he might actually come.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.403
But, Clem, if Dad's not there,

03:49.446 --> 03:52.710
who's gonna get drunk and hit on
the "most gettable" bridesmaid?

03:54.190 --> 03:56.148
Babe, I know
we discussed this,

03:56.192 --> 03:57.628
but he is your father.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.064
If you don't invite him,

03:59.108 --> 04:00.718
I'm pretty sure
you're gonna regret it later.

04:00.762 --> 04:04.200
And I have so many STDs.

04:07.464 --> 04:11.251
Your wedding is supposed to be
the happiest day of your life.

04:11.294 --> 04:14.036
And if my dad comes...

04:14.079 --> 04:16.821
Okay, have you ever been
on vacation,

04:16.865 --> 04:18.519
and you're so excited,

04:18.562 --> 04:20.869
and then the cruise ship sinks
and you die?

04:22.653 --> 04:24.438
That's how it'll feel.

04:24.481 --> 04:27.049
Oh, Clem, I understand.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.443
Honey, there's a lot
of pain here.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.966
I won't push.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.142
Here comes the push.

04:33.185 --> 04:36.319
But I believe that no
relationship is beyond repair.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.235
So, why don't we have your
father here for dinner,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.324
and you two can start
mending fences.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.891
CLEM: Have I
ever mentioned

04:42.934 --> 04:46.024
that when my appendix burst,
my dad told me to walk it off?

04:46.068 --> 04:49.506
Sweetheart, let me put
my therapist hat on.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.814
This is a chance for you
to accept your father

04:52.857 --> 04:56.252
for who he is and begin healing
the wounds of the past.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.820
[exhales]
What do you think, Shannon?

04:58.863 --> 05:01.779
I think it's weird to be
taking advice from someone

05:01.823 --> 05:04.173
who's wearing an invisible hat.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.134
Well, honey,
if you want my opinion,

05:09.178 --> 05:10.658
I don't think one dinner
could hurt.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.834
And I know
for a fact that

05:12.877 --> 05:14.966
my mom's never gonna give
this up if you don't say yes.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.185

It's true.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.361
She is gonna
wear you down, girl.

What? You know I'm right.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.192
He's right, I will.

[knock at door]

05:35.247 --> 05:36.466
You don't answer your phone?

05:36.510 --> 05:38.250
I've been calling
and texting all day.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.513
You think I text?

05:39.556 --> 05:41.036
Who am I, Steve Jobs?

05:42.211 --> 05:45.257
The only people who call me
are bill collectors.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.390
Wait, Best Buy didn't send you,
did they?

05:47.434 --> 05:49.697
[scoffs]
I need to ask you something.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.743
Hang on, I'm filling out
my racing form here.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.441
You remember when you used
to help me pick the horses?

05:54.484 --> 05:57.618
Yep. When you lost,
we'd go to the pawn shop.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.402
When you won, we'd go back
to the pawn shop

05:59.446 --> 06:01.186
and pick up my bicycle.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.188
Come on, sit with me.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.407
What do you think?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.409
You're the best at this.I don't care, Dad.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.455
Well, you're not the one
in deep to your bookie,

06:08.498 --> 06:09.586
and Best Buy.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.849
Help me out here.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.416
Any of these horses
catch your eye?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.635
"Tar Heel,"

06:14.678 --> 06:16.071
"Jimmy J,"

06:16.114 --> 06:17.725
"Call Me By Your Mane"?

06:19.466 --> 06:20.902
Go with
"Poor Child Eats."

06:20.945 --> 06:22.512
He's finished just out
of the money twice,

06:22.556 --> 06:23.948
and he dropped down
a class.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.124
"Poor Child Eats" it is.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.649
Okay, sweetie, thanks
for stopping by.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.303
That's not why
I came here.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.914
Nick's parents want to know

06:32.957 --> 06:34.655
if you'd like to come over
for dinner tomorrow night.

06:34.698 --> 06:37.658
I know you're gonna say no,
but I promised I'd ask.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.050
Okay. Sure, I'll come.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.183
Uh, excuse me?

06:41.226 --> 06:42.576
Why would I say no?

06:42.619 --> 06:45.448
Because when have you ever
done anything for me?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.232
Hey, who got you that bike?

06:47.276 --> 06:48.582
Several times?

06:50.279 --> 06:52.368
So anyway, this, uh,
this dinner thing--

06:52.412 --> 06:53.456
should I bring Shannon?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.458
She moved out of here
a week ago.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.720
She lives with me now.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.418
Did you seriously not notice?

06:58.461 --> 07:00.115
Hey, I'm a busy
homicide detective,

07:00.158 --> 07:02.770
you can't expect me to pay
attention to every detail.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.210
Oh, hey, Shannon,
can I talk to you for a second?

07:08.253 --> 07:11.474
Sure. One Mississippi, bye...

07:11.518 --> 07:12.954
Okay, seriously.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.478
Shannon, I really appreciate you
loading the dishwasher.

07:15.522 --> 07:16.610
Let's check out
your work.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.133
Now, you started off
pretty strong.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.482
Plate, plate, plate.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.484
Now, here's where things
get a little rocky.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.485
Right, mm-hmm.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.226
Plate, empty slot...Yeah.

07:24.269 --> 07:25.967
...bowl, sideways bowl,

07:26.010 --> 07:28.491
high-top.[gasps]

07:28.535 --> 07:30.667
Cool. The gum came off.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.802
Oh, hey, babe. How'd
it go with your dad?

07:34.845 --> 07:36.499
Fantastic.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.112
Okay, what happened?

07:41.156 --> 07:44.333
I invited him to dinner,
and guess what he said.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.467
"I can't go.
I have a date with a hooker."

07:47.510 --> 07:51.383
He said yes.
Hence...

07:51.427 --> 07:52.428
Ah, ah, ah. Okay.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.603
Come on, Clem.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.170
I think this can
be a good thing.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.476
Look, I know you.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.303
You're a strong woman.
You can handle anything.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.480
Maybe not the
coffee maker.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.135
But I have no doubt that
you can handle your dad.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.659
That's easy for you to say.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.443
Your dad's perfect.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.445
Perfect? You didn't
grow up with him.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.664
The man is far
from perfect.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.753
Aw, really?

08:12.796 --> 08:14.929
What did he do to you?

08:14.972 --> 08:17.671
Did he give you
too much ice cream?

08:17.714 --> 08:21.109
No. He's more of
a fro-yo guy.

08:21.152 --> 08:24.460
I mean, every
Thursday night.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.898
I mean, come on,
switch it up, Walt!

08:27.942 --> 08:30.553
Okay... [chuckles]
...let me get this straight.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.425
My dad wouldn't let me take
ballet lessons when I was six

08:33.469 --> 08:34.818
because, and I quote,

08:34.862 --> 08:37.255
"My daughter ain't gonna be
no stripper."

08:38.387 --> 08:40.128
And you're complaining
that your dad

08:40.171 --> 08:42.434
would occasionally
get you frozen treats?

08:42.478 --> 08:45.699
Well, excuse me for trying
to fit in with you guys.

08:45.742 --> 08:49.964
Why you got to be so mean?

08:50.007 --> 08:52.488
This dinner is gonna
be a disaster.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.794
Let's hope.

08:53.837 --> 08:54.838
What do you mean?

08:54.882 --> 08:56.448
If Dad's his typical jerk self,

08:56.492 --> 08:58.581
then Walt and Rose will finally
get off your back

08:58.625 --> 09:00.148
about having him come
to the wedding.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.453
You know what,
you're right.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.585
This is perfect.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.587
I'll get credit
for giving Dad a chance,

09:04.631 --> 09:07.721
and they'll think that
I'm the mature, evolved person

09:07.764 --> 09:09.461
that I absolutely am not.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.551
[mouths]

09:11.594 --> 09:13.204
[doorbell rings]

09:13.248 --> 09:15.250
Come in, come in.

09:15.293 --> 09:18.601
Wait till you see the meal
this lady prepared.

09:18.645 --> 09:22.562
But save some room,
'cause we got fro-yo.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.221
We are so excited about
having your father over.

09:30.265 --> 09:33.442
So, no Tupperware?

09:35.444 --> 09:37.838
[both laughing]

09:37.881 --> 09:40.536
We haven't finished
the pot roast yet.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.407
Oh, no problem.
Totally fine.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.932
No rush. When you're finished,
you'll bring it back.

09:44.975 --> 09:45.976
Absolutely.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.587
When do you think that'll be?

09:47.630 --> 09:49.763
[knocking at door]Oh.

09:49.806 --> 09:50.981
Here we go.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.548
Hey.Somebody call the police?

09:52.592 --> 09:53.636
[Walt laughs]

09:53.680 --> 09:56.117
Freddy, so good
you could make it.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.553
Ah, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.729
Hello, girls.
Don't you look lovely?

09:59.773 --> 10:03.167
Thank you?Thank you?

10:03.211 --> 10:06.170
Walt, this is for you.
I hear you're a wine guy.

10:06.214 --> 10:10.000
Oh, Freddy, this is
a very nice bottle of wine.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.306
You-you shouldn't have.

10:11.349 --> 10:12.612
Oh, no, no, I didn't buy it.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.657
God, no. I swiped it
from the evidence locker.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.443
Big hedge fund manager
got whacked in his brownstone.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.315
His loss, our gain, right?

10:20.358 --> 10:23.405
I should be horrified,
but you don't pass up

10:23.448 --> 10:25.233
a '93 Chateau Margaux.

10:25.276 --> 10:29.498
Grab some glasses, Nick, we're
gonna open this bad boy up.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.108
So nice to have you here,
Freddy.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.545
Well, thank you so much
for inviting me, Rose.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.287
And, uh, what is that
that smells so terrific?

10:36.331 --> 10:37.985
Oh, it's just my
chicken marsala.

10:38.028 --> 10:41.684
Oh. Elegant and a good cook.Thank you.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.426
You remind me of the woman
that broke up my first marriage.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.476
How sweet of you to say.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.696
Um, I'm gonna go
check on the dinner.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.004
Make yourself comfortable.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.399
All right, Dad,
what's going on?

11:01.443 --> 11:02.836
You're on time,
you brought a gift,

11:02.879 --> 11:05.360
it's 6:00, and you don't
smell like tequila.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.883
What, I can't make
a good impression?

11:06.927 --> 11:10.365
No. That is why
we're confused.

11:10.408 --> 11:13.368
Hey, Freddy, just curious.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.326
These red spots on the bottle,
it's not...

11:15.370 --> 11:17.415
Yeah, it's blood.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.375
Okay.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.292
So the guy aims
the gun at me,

11:24.335 --> 11:26.294
cocks the hammer,
and bang.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.209
When you're staring death
in her face,

11:28.252 --> 11:30.341
time completely slows down.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.734
SHANNON:
So, what happened, Dad?

11:31.778 --> 11:34.215
Were you killed?

11:35.607 --> 11:37.261
Very funny.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.220
The truth is,
I thought of you, Shannon.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.351
And you, Clem.

11:40.395 --> 11:44.181
And I realized in that moment

11:44.225 --> 11:46.444
that I haven't been
much of a dad to you girls.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.491
And if that bullet hit me,
I'd never get that chance.

11:51.014 --> 11:54.278
I was once nearly concussed
when a lighting rig fell

11:54.322 --> 11:56.672
when I was starring
in the Broadway production

11:56.716 --> 11:58.282
of Miss Saigon.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.983
But continue.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.159
Anyway, it all ended happy.

12:05.202 --> 12:07.204
I ducked and shot him
in the face. The end.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.816
These potatoes are dynamite.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.861
I've never heard
that story before, Dad.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.603
Happened last Thursday.
It was a real wake-up call.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.387
ROSE:
It just proves

12:16.431 --> 12:18.389
that sometimes it takes
a life-changing event,

12:18.433 --> 12:21.392
like a near-death
experience, or a wedding,

12:21.436 --> 12:23.525
to realize

12:23.568 --> 12:26.484
there is nothing more
important than family.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.486
WALT:
I gotta say, Freddy,

12:28.530 --> 12:30.401
your life sounds
incredibly exciting.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.142
Well, you should stop by
the station tomorrow.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.187
I'll show you around.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.841
Can I ride in the patrol car?

12:34.884 --> 12:37.539
Hell, you can shoot my gun.
You're family.

12:37.582 --> 12:41.412
Oh, no, I got it.
Let me help you.

12:42.587 --> 12:46.461
[sighs] Can you believe he
expects us to fall for this?

12:47.984 --> 12:49.246
Wait, you're not
falling for this.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.291
Oh, my God,
are you falling for this?

12:50.334 --> 12:51.596
How could you fall for this?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.643
Dude, did you not hear
that story?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.166
I think it really affected him.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.559
I think so, too.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.126
And I can't believe
I just agreed with someone

12:59.169 --> 13:00.649
who put aluminum foil
in the microwave

13:00.692 --> 13:02.085
six times today.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.568
I don't care what he said.
People don't just change.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.048
Oh, really?

13:08.091 --> 13:09.832
You're always talking about
how you've changed,

13:09.876 --> 13:13.009
how you're all together now
with your fancy job

13:13.053 --> 13:14.402
and your young-mom-
in-a-mini-van outfits.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.230
[gasps]

13:16.273 --> 13:17.666
"Young mom"?

13:17.709 --> 13:19.102
Yeah.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.844
This is cocktail sexy.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.020
Oh, sure. Very... very sexy.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.066
Um, by the way,
do you mind if I watch Shrek

13:26.109 --> 13:27.981
on your back seat DVD player?
Is that okay?

13:28.024 --> 13:29.417
[laughing]

13:31.201 --> 13:33.421
[laughter trails off]

13:36.380 --> 13:38.034
You are so pretty.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.389
[talking loudly]: Yo, Nick,
did you notice my surprise?

13:45.433 --> 13:47.609
I noticed those are
my headphones.

13:50.133 --> 13:52.222
Okay, look at this.
Look, look, look.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.225
I unloaded the dishwasher,
just like you asked.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.793
Well, Shannon, thank you.
I am impressed.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.229
Now, when you ran it,
did you use rinse aid

13:59.273 --> 14:00.317
or just detergent?

14:00.361 --> 14:02.319
When I ran what?

14:02.363 --> 14:03.581
[knocking at door]

14:03.625 --> 14:05.670
Coming.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.629
Hi.

14:07.672 --> 14:08.717
Oh, hey, Mom and Dad.
What's up?

14:08.760 --> 14:09.936
Oh, nothing.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.676
We were just out
for a little stroll,

14:11.720 --> 14:13.765
and we thought that
we would pop by

14:13.809 --> 14:16.420
for a quick hello...
Hello.

14:16.464 --> 14:20.033
She's here for the Tupperware.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.296
Mom, mo--
There's still food in there.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.863
You had your time.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.345
I just wanted to thank you guys
for having my father over.

14:28.389 --> 14:31.392
Oh, not a problem.
And like I told you,

14:31.435 --> 14:34.874
you never know someone's changed
until you give them a chance.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.440
He did seem different.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.355
I mean, he was charming,
he was funny.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.791
I've never seen him
do karaoke before.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.315
Who would have guessed
that he knew all the lyrics

14:41.358 --> 14:43.578
to "Baby Got Back"?

14:43.621 --> 14:46.494
It seems your father's
turned over a new leaf.

14:46.537 --> 14:49.845
And that new charity he started?
Very impressive.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.107
Charity?

14:51.151 --> 14:52.848
Yes, the one for children.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.981
He's very passionate about it.
What's it called?

14:55.024 --> 14:57.984
Poor Child Eats.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.942
I wrote him a check for it
when I visited him

14:59.986 --> 15:01.117
at the police station today.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.076
Come on, Rose.Mm. Bye.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.208
Bye.

15:05.252 --> 15:09.082
I knew it. I knew Dad was
working some angle.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.518
What are you talking about?
Did you not just hear them?

15:10.561 --> 15:13.042
He started a charity.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.739
He doesn't have a charity.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.394
Then what did my dad
give money to?

15:17.438 --> 15:21.137
Two grand on Poor Child Eats
to win.

15:21.181 --> 15:24.967
And if he does,
I'm taking you... Gloria,

15:25.011 --> 15:28.275
to... Chipotle.

15:37.023 --> 15:40.983
[sighs]
Of course you're here.

15:41.027 --> 15:44.160
You are seriously the most
horrible person in the world.

15:44.204 --> 15:47.163
Well, it's good to be
the best at something.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.992
I can't believe the only reason
you came to dinner

15:50.036 --> 15:51.951
was to scam Walt out of $2,000

15:51.994 --> 15:53.778
so that you could bet
on a horse.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.084
Do you know how
that makes me look?

15:55.128 --> 15:57.608
I guess, by comparison,
pretty good.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.307
I had no choice,
Clem, I told you.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.221
I'm in deep
with this bookie,

16:01.264 --> 16:03.005
and I got the Geek Squad guys

16:03.049 --> 16:04.441
breathing down my neck.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.139
But if this bet hits,
everything's gonna be fine.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.576
Come on, the race is
about to start.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.273
Let's watch it,
like we used to.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.796
Like we used to?

16:11.840 --> 16:14.147
Does that mean you're gonna
give me a cigar to smoke, too?

16:14.190 --> 16:15.713
You want one?

16:15.757 --> 16:18.194
No. I didn't like cigars
when I was 11,

16:18.238 --> 16:19.630
and I don't like them now.Come on, stay.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.502
[starting bell rings]ANNOUNCER: And they're off.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.808
Call Me By Your Mane is
quick out of the gate,

16:23.852 --> 16:25.941
followed closely by
A Horse With This Name

16:25.985 --> 16:27.595
and No, You're the Puppet.

16:27.638 --> 16:30.511
Right behind them, Poor Child
Eats is making an early charge.

16:30.554 --> 16:32.252
Look at that, he's pulling up
on the outside. Come on, baby.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.601
I don't care.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.951
ANNOUNCER: Bojack Horsehorse
leaps into second

16:35.995 --> 16:37.648
as Poor Child Eats
is hanging tough.

16:37.692 --> 16:38.823
Around the corner they come.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.173
Could be anyone's race
at this point.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.478
ANNOUNCER:
As the finish approaches...Come on.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.045
...it's Poor Child Eats
pulling up on the rail.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.046
Poor Child Eats closing in.Come on.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.049
It's Poor Child Eats by a nose!

16:47.093 --> 16:49.138
Yes!Yeah!

16:49.182 --> 16:51.401
Yes! Yes!

16:51.445 --> 16:53.273
You did it, Clem.
You picked another winner.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.362
Damn right I did.

16:55.405 --> 16:56.928
Just like old times, huh?

16:56.972 --> 17:00.062
Yeah. Wait.
No, don't even.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.238
I'm still mad at you.

17:02.282 --> 17:06.242
Hey, I know I wasn't
the perfect father,

17:06.286 --> 17:08.592
but you turned out okay.No thanks to you.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.117
Did you ever think there was
a method to my madness?

17:11.160 --> 17:15.164
I mean, I knew I was no good,
so instead of half-assing it,

17:15.208 --> 17:17.166
I zero-assed it.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.342
Excuse me?Yeah.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.083
I figured if I didn't try
at all, you'd be forced

17:21.127 --> 17:22.563
to sink or swim on your own,

17:22.606 --> 17:24.347
and you swam.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.088
I'm proud of you, Clem.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.438
There was no philosophy.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.310
You were just a terrible father.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.182
Yeah, but the "zero-assed" thing
sounded pretty good.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.752
The truth is I am proud of you.

17:37.795 --> 17:41.582
And you got to admit, we had
some good times, right?

17:41.625 --> 17:44.193
Yeah, I guess we did.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.413
Occasionally.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.328
You know, in baseball,
if you hit .300,

17:48.371 --> 17:49.720
you're in the Hall of Fame.

17:49.764 --> 17:53.202
And in parenting, if you use
the ball pit at IKEA

17:53.246 --> 17:57.076
as a babysitter, you get a call
from Child Services.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.209
I did get a call.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.385
The woman was nice.
I took her to Mexico.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.392
I'm so sorry about my dad,
but at least I was able

18:09.436 --> 18:10.263
to get your money back.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.003
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

18:12.047 --> 18:15.398
These things happen,
especially to Walt.

18:15.442 --> 18:18.009
He bought a time share
in India.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.360
We went there to see it,
and guess what?

18:20.403 --> 18:22.405
No time share.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.062
I am so sorry I pressured you
into inviting your father

18:27.106 --> 18:28.716
to the wedding.

18:28.759 --> 18:32.372
Sometimes I just need to back
off and mind my own business.

18:32.415 --> 18:35.157
No, you know what,
if you hadn't done that,

18:35.201 --> 18:37.986
I wouldn't have had the first
nice moment I've had with him

18:38.029 --> 18:40.945
in years, so... thank you.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.034
Well, if you change your mind
and you do want

18:43.078 --> 18:46.299
to invite him to the wedding,
you just say the word,

18:46.342 --> 18:48.866
and I will give your daddy
an STD.

18:54.611 --> 18:55.830
You wouldn't be the first.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.443
You okay?

19:00.487 --> 19:02.010
Yeah. I just feel like
a giant idiot

19:02.053 --> 19:03.620
for believing that
Dad changed.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.361
No, don't.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.668
It's good that you
still have hope.

19:07.711 --> 19:11.193
It's completely misguided,
but hold onto it.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.542
For what it's worth,

19:12.586 --> 19:14.849
I'm happy I'm living
with you guys and not him.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.198
Mm.Oh, my parents took off?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.940
Yeah, they split.
I was just about to tell Shannon

19:18.983 --> 19:21.247
how happy we are that
she's living with us.
