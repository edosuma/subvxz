00:09.965 --> 00:11.827
- How are you
still working here?

00:11.827 --> 00:13.344
I don't know what you mean.

00:13.344 --> 00:15.379
- Now you know we can't talk
about our clearance.

00:15.379 --> 00:17.103
- Then, why are you
talking about it?

00:17.103 --> 00:19.103
I'm here to keep you company.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.724
- You're gonna watch
my every move?

00:20.724 --> 00:22.275
You're a little bitch,

00:22.275 --> 00:24.931
and I don't want you
to forget that.

00:24.931 --> 00:26.793
Come in here, talk to me.

00:26.793 --> 00:28.793
What do you want from me?

00:28.793 --> 00:30.103
She's ignoring me.

00:30.103 --> 00:31.689
Find that girl,
and bring her here.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.482
- Hi, Sharon.
- What the hell?

00:39.103 --> 00:41.862
You leave me alone.

00:41.862 --> 00:44.206
Hold on.

00:44.206 --> 00:46.551
Sharon, you don't even know
how to use that gun.

00:46.551 --> 00:49.586
- Oh, I know how to use it,
now, get out of here.

00:49.586 --> 00:51.758
- Don't you wanna know
why I'm here?

00:51.758 --> 00:53.724
No, I'm calling the police.

00:53.724 --> 00:55.034
Sharon...

00:55.034 --> 00:56.620
Get out of here now!

00:56.620 --> 00:58.793
- Look...I just have someone
who wants to talk to you.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.137
I don't care.

01:00.137 --> 01:02.344
- I don't care,
he's very powerful.

01:02.344 --> 01:04.068
- I'ma tell you this
one more time,

01:04.068 --> 01:05.724
get the -- out of this store!

01:07.379 --> 01:09.413
- You sure you don't just
wanna come with me?

01:09.413 --> 01:10.896
Don't come any closer.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.068
- Sharon...
- Don't!

01:13.068 --> 01:16.862
- Don't--
don't--do not do that.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.758
- Don't you move.
- It is just--

01:19.758 --> 01:21.965
- Don't move!
- It's just my cell phone!

01:24.241 --> 01:26.827
Sharon...

01:26.827 --> 01:28.586
Sharon!

01:28.586 --> 01:32.724
- Yes, hello, someone's here,
he's trying to kidnap me, and...

01:32.724 --> 01:37.206
hello, hello, -- ?

01:37.206 --> 01:39.482
What did you do?

01:39.482 --> 01:42.344
As I said, he's very powerful.

01:42.344 --> 01:45.724
- Get the -- out
of my store...now!

01:47.413 --> 01:50.862
No.

01:56.896 --> 02:00.103
- MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
the President and First Lady.

02:38.482 --> 02:40.689
- KYLE:

02:40.689 --> 02:42.241
- I did not think
you would do that.

02:42.241 --> 02:43.689
- No!
No, no!

02:43.689 --> 02:44.965
- Hey--
- No!

02:44.965 --> 02:46.241
- Shh!
- No! Help me!

02:46.241 --> 02:50.103
- No, no!
- Sit, sit!

02:50.103 --> 02:51.896
- Let go of me.
- Why don't you just--

02:51.896 --> 02:53.344
- No!
- Shut up!

02:53.344 --> 02:55.206
Shut up! Why are you
putting up such a fuss?

02:55.206 --> 02:56.896
You put a hole
in my good shirt.

02:56.896 --> 02:58.206
I'm sorry, please.

02:58.206 --> 02:59.551
- Yeah, well that
bullet stings like hell

02:59.551 --> 03:01.103
even with this vest on, Sharon.

03:01.103 --> 03:04.551
- I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

03:04.551 --> 03:07.620
- He just wants to talk to you.
- Who?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.965
You know who, Sharon.

03:11.413 --> 03:14.482
You know who.

03:14.482 --> 03:16.931
- The President?
- Yes.

03:16.931 --> 03:21.413
- He sent you?
- Yes, and you shot me, --!

03:21.413 --> 03:24.310
Now, can you just come
with me, please?

03:24.310 --> 03:25.689
I don't want to.

03:25.689 --> 03:30.034
- Darling, you don't
have a choice.

03:30.034 --> 03:31.517
You're going to get up,

03:31.517 --> 03:34.379
and you are gonna
come with me.

03:34.379 --> 03:37.034
Do not try
anything else, Sharon.

03:37.034 --> 03:39.551
Listen to me, I have been
taking it easy on your butt,

03:39.551 --> 03:42.241
I can snap your neck in
one second if I wanted to,

03:42.241 --> 03:43.896
now, let's get up and go.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.551
- Sharon...
- Okay.

03:46.551 --> 03:49.655
Don't try anything.

03:49.655 --> 03:50.793
I won't.

03:50.793 --> 03:53.689
- I am sick
of this --, Sharon.

03:53.689 --> 03:59.241
I'ma let you go,
I'm gonna stand up...

03:59.241 --> 04:00.724
Be a good little girl,

04:00.724 --> 04:03.620
and you're gonna do
the same thing.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.689
You ready?
I am done being patient.

04:14.448 --> 04:16.862
Now go into the back,

04:16.862 --> 04:20.137
you're going
to continue to behave.

04:20.137 --> 04:21.965
After you.

04:30.827 --> 04:32.965
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:32.965 --> 04:35.827
- So, I brought you a few.
I have this one.

04:35.827 --> 04:37.931
Okay.

04:37.931 --> 04:40.448
- And this one.
- Oh, yeah, these--

04:40.448 --> 04:41.689
- And--
- Lilly...

04:41.689 --> 04:43.586
- This one.

04:43.586 --> 04:45.379
These are beautiful.

04:46.793 --> 04:49.793
Okay, great.

04:49.793 --> 04:53.517
- You know, I, um,
have to have lunch

04:53.517 --> 04:55.517
with the Second Lady tomorrow,

04:55.517 --> 04:57.517
have you met her?

04:57.517 --> 04:59.758
No, ma'am, I haven't.

05:02.413 --> 05:04.172
She is a bitch.

05:06.103 --> 05:08.068
Really?

05:08.068 --> 05:09.172
That's surprising.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.896
Why do you say that, dear?

05:14.965 --> 05:19.965
- Well, everything I've heard
is she's amazing.

05:19.965 --> 05:24.586
- Well, you can't believe any
of what you hear

05:24.586 --> 05:27.000
or see these days.

05:29.172 --> 05:31.689
I see.

05:31.689 --> 05:34.896
- You know, my approval rating
would be as high as hers

05:34.896 --> 05:39.689
if people weren't always trying
to tear me down.

05:39.689 --> 05:41.689
- Well, I'm sure
yours will get better.

05:44.379 --> 05:45.620
What does that mean?

05:48.620 --> 05:52.137
Oh, your approval rating.

05:53.758 --> 05:56.896
Well, my approval rating
has nothing to do with dresses.

05:59.379 --> 06:01.275
No, ma'am, it doesn't.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.793
Then why did you bring it up?

06:09.517 --> 06:14.413
I didn't, you just did.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.172
Not for your sympathy.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.827
No, of course not.

06:23.482 --> 06:25.793
Be careful, okay?

06:28.724 --> 06:34.758
- Yes, ma'am,
are we done here?

06:34.758 --> 06:38.241
- Oh, dear,
have I offended you?

06:38.241 --> 06:40.793
No, ma'am, you haven't.

06:40.793 --> 06:44.034
- I'm--I'm just not good
at pedestrian talk.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.172
Excuse me?

06:48.172 --> 06:53.275
- I'm the First Lady,
I have a lot to do.

06:55.896 --> 06:59.137
That's right, you sure do.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.551
Do you doubt me?

07:02.551 --> 07:05.241
No, not at all.

07:05.241 --> 07:09.068
- Good, because it's your job
to help me look good

07:09.068 --> 07:11.379
while I'm doing it.

07:11.379 --> 07:13.551
And that, we can arrange.

07:13.551 --> 07:15.137
Okay.

07:25.620 --> 07:30.103
Uh, can I help you?

07:30.103 --> 07:33.000
- No, I was just, uh,
looking for the restroom.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.448
Bobby?

07:37.448 --> 07:38.551
Richard.

07:40.137 --> 07:41.931
How are you?

07:41.931 --> 07:44.586
I'm good.

07:44.586 --> 07:46.827
I didn't know
you were on the detail.

07:46.827 --> 07:48.758
Yeah, well, it just happened.

07:48.758 --> 07:53.172
Oh wow, that's great.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.172
Yeah.

07:55.172 --> 07:57.379
You, uh, need anything?

07:57.379 --> 07:59.482
No, I'm good, thank you.

07:59.482 --> 08:00.896
Okay.

08:00.896 --> 08:04.586
Hey, uh, what shift are you on?

08:04.586 --> 08:05.862
This one.

08:05.862 --> 08:09.310
- Oh, good,
um, have you seen Sam?

08:09.310 --> 08:11.206
No.

08:11.206 --> 08:14.655
- Look, if you see him, you
tell him I 'm looking for him.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.448
Okay, will do.

08:17.448 --> 08:20.034
How is he as a boss?

08:21.896 --> 08:24.034
What do you mean?

08:24.034 --> 08:26.689
- Well, if you're
working this detail,

08:26.689 --> 08:29.172
then you're working for Sam.

08:31.275 --> 08:35.172
Right, Sam, he's great.

08:35.172 --> 08:37.931
Okay, that's good.

08:37.931 --> 08:41.034
Yeah, well, I'll be on my way.

08:41.034 --> 08:42.482
Hey...

08:51.068 --> 08:54.551
- Don't let him
give you no -- .

08:54.551 --> 08:57.034
- You know I won't.
- Okay .

08:57.034 --> 08:59.137
- I'll see ya.
- Yes, sir.

08:59.137 --> 09:00.827
It was good
to see you, Bobby.

09:00.827 --> 09:02.379
Good to see you, too.

09:26.793 --> 09:28.413
Dale, you got a whole bedroom,

09:28.413 --> 09:31.379
you sure you don't wanna go
there instead of the couch?

09:31.379 --> 09:33.275
Can I just lay here?

09:33.275 --> 09:34.413
Yeah.

09:34.413 --> 09:36.000
Thanks.

09:40.068 --> 09:41.655
Thank you.

09:41.655 --> 09:43.137
Sure.

09:43.137 --> 09:46.517
- I mean, thank you
for all of this.

09:46.517 --> 09:48.068
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

09:48.068 --> 09:50.965
I mean, you didn't have to.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.413
It's all right, Dale.

09:53.413 --> 09:55.620
I can see your reservations.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.517
I get it, man, it's okay.

09:57.517 --> 10:00.793
- I'm sorry that, I mean, that
all this has happened to you.

10:00.793 --> 10:04.034
Thank you.

10:04.034 --> 10:07.310
But listen, um, the store...

10:07.310 --> 10:09.344
it--it--it's something
that I've been thinking--

10:09.344 --> 10:10.551
I'm not gonna sue you.

10:10.551 --> 10:12.137
What?

10:12.137 --> 10:14.689
- I heard you before,
and I'm not gonna sue you.

10:14.689 --> 10:16.724
What--what did you do?

10:16.724 --> 10:19.344
- Yeah, I mean, it is
my pharmacy, you know,

10:19.344 --> 10:21.344
- it's my family's--
- Relax.

10:21.344 --> 10:23.275
Okay, thank you.

10:23.275 --> 10:24.862
Yeah.

10:24.862 --> 10:26.517
- Well, you--you want a drink
or something,

10:26.517 --> 10:29.206
- something to eat?
- No, I'm good.

10:29.206 --> 10:33.275
- All right, but...
let me ask you something else.

10:33.275 --> 10:35.310
Okay.

10:35.310 --> 10:38.793
- Are you sure you don't
know who did it?

10:38.793 --> 10:41.413
- It's, um, I'm--

10:41.413 --> 10:43.172
It's what?

10:43.172 --> 10:44.758
I'm not sure.

10:44.758 --> 10:46.310
- Are you in
some kind of trouble

10:46.310 --> 10:48.344
that I should know about?

10:48.344 --> 10:49.758
No, I'm not.

10:49.758 --> 10:51.793
- Dale...
- I'm not.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.655
- Dale, we have
Sharon at the pharmacy,

10:53.655 --> 10:55.517
I don't want her to get hurt.

10:55.517 --> 10:58.689
- Look, I--I'm not
doing anything,

10:58.689 --> 11:02.344
and I really don't even know
how I got that guy's attention.

11:02.344 --> 11:07.482
- That guy, that--that guy,
so you do know who did it?

11:07.482 --> 11:11.034
- All I know is that the guy
that was harassing me,

11:11.034 --> 11:13.275
I think he has something
to do with this.

11:13.275 --> 11:16.793
- The Secret Service man?
- Yeah.

11:16.793 --> 11:20.068
Okay, so he's dangerous.

11:20.068 --> 11:23.862
- Yeah, which is why I'm gonna
stay away from him.

11:23.862 --> 11:26.517
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- I'm really sorry.

11:26.517 --> 11:29.551
- No, Dale...
I get it, man,

11:29.551 --> 11:31.275
you've been through a lot.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.793
It's all right,

11:32.793 --> 11:35.068
just if anything happens,
you know what to do...

11:35.068 --> 11:37.034
- talk to me, yeah?
- Okay.

11:37.034 --> 11:40.655
- Okay, I'm gonna go
help Sharon lock up.

11:40.655 --> 11:42.482
TV is right there.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.379
Hi.

12:07.379 --> 12:09.896
Hello.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.482
How are you?

12:14.068 --> 12:18.034
I'm good, I'm good,

12:18.034 --> 12:20.758
what are you
doing here this late?

12:20.758 --> 12:23.448
- Oh, the First Lady
wanted to see me.

12:23.448 --> 12:24.793
This late?

12:24.793 --> 12:26.758
Well, you know how she is.

12:26.758 --> 12:29.931
Yeah, I do.

12:29.931 --> 12:32.206
- And I've been here
for hours now.

12:32.206 --> 12:35.000
Well, what did she want?

12:36.310 --> 12:40.896
- Dresses,
same ole, same ole.

12:40.896 --> 12:42.724
That's good, right?

12:53.206 --> 12:56.931
How's your day going?

12:56.931 --> 12:58.724
It's good.

12:58.724 --> 13:00.931
Good.

13:00.931 --> 13:03.000
- Is that all you
came here to ask me?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.793
Oh, yes.

13:04.793 --> 13:07.413
Yeah, you sure?

13:07.413 --> 13:09.034
- Well, why
would there be more?

13:11.103 --> 13:13.827
You don't do this.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.448
Well, I did.

13:16.448 --> 13:19.896
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
before you found out.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.103
That you didn't want women.

13:24.103 --> 13:28.724
- Nah, honey, nah,
it's not that,

13:28.724 --> 13:31.310
I just don't want you, hm.

13:35.068 --> 13:39.586
- I see...we're in
a bitchy mood today, huh?

13:39.586 --> 13:43.482
- Yeah, yeah, you know,
I think I need some ass.

13:43.482 --> 13:46.793
Of the other persuasion,
that is, yeah.

13:48.137 --> 13:50.655
- Just say --, Donald.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.586
Yeah.

13:52.586 --> 13:58.379

and vulgar today .

14:00.206 --> 14:02.068

14:05.965 --> 14:08.206

14:08.206 --> 14:10.413
I just wanted to say, hi.

14:10.413 --> 14:12.793
Okay.

14:12.793 --> 14:14.448
Can I just say, hi?

14:14.448 --> 14:19.758
- You said it when you came in,
you wanna say it again?

14:22.103 --> 14:24.931
Oh, hi, Mrs. Winthrop.

14:24.931 --> 14:28.000
Oh, hi, hi, Allan .

15:05.862 --> 15:07.379
- Is that so?
- LILLY: Mm-hm.

15:08.793 --> 15:11.896
- And why does he know
about it, and I don't, hm?

15:11.896 --> 15:13.793
Because I had him clear them.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.965

You can count on it.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.034

B-Y-R-O-N.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.862
- Byron Charles,
is he still here?

15:49.862 --> 15:51.793
- He hasn't
checked out yet, sir.

15:51.793 --> 15:54.241
- Okay, I want you to get me
surveillance footage

15:54.241 --> 15:56.275

16:02.413 --> 16:04.655
you better let me know
about it first, you understand?

16:04.655 --> 16:06.413
Yes, sir, of course.

16:06.413 --> 16:07.965
Did--did I do anything wrong?

16:07.965 --> 16:12.448

Yes, sir, right away.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.448
Yeah.

Sneaky --

Well, how did you get in here?

17:04.310 --> 17:06.034
I got clearance.

17:06.034 --> 17:07.551
- You're -- lying,
no, you didn't.

17:07.551 --> 17:09.172
Why would I lie to you?

17:09.172 --> 17:10.827
By who, huh?

17:10.827 --> 17:12.620
Max, we can't talk here.

17:12.620 --> 17:16.620
Bobby, are you in on this?

17:16.620 --> 17:20.724
- What?
You oughta know that by now.

17:20.724 --> 17:22.896
- Then how did you just
walk into the White House?

17:22.896 --> 17:24.724
- BOBBY: Max, it wasn't easy.
- MAX: No.

17:24.724 --> 17:26.137
Okay.

17:26.137 --> 17:28.655

17:28.655 --> 17:30.172
Okay.

17:30.172 --> 17:31.586
You see these cameras,
you see this mirror?

17:31.586 --> 17:33.172
They're listening
to us right now,

17:33.172 --> 17:34.689
so you need to keep
your voice down.

17:34.689 --> 17:36.448
- No, no, no, no,
I don't believe you,

17:36.448 --> 17:38.206
I don't believe
any of this --.

17:38.206 --> 17:39.689
- Okay then don't
believe me then, --.

17:39.689 --> 17:41.379
Don't believe
that I just risked my life

17:41.379 --> 17:42.931
to come in here to save you.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.758
- Right, yeah well, I won't
because there's no way.

17:44.758 --> 17:46.620

After all we been through?

17:46.620 --> 17:48.931

Oh, damn.

17:59.206 --> 18:01.448

18:01.448 --> 18:05.000
This was all a set up.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.241
What?

18:06.241 --> 18:08.206
To get me in here.

18:08.206 --> 18:11.896
- Oh my god, oh my god,

18:11.896 --> 18:14.310
- No, no, no, no,
see it was all too smooth.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.862
You know, I was getting
into too many places,

18:15.862 --> 18:18.275
and they were watching me
the entire time.

18:18.275 --> 18:22.206
- Yeah? Yeah, Mr. Smooth,
who is they?

18:22.206 --> 18:24.689
I don't know, Max.

18:24.689 --> 18:30.206
- Oh, oh, that's right, 'cuz you
don't know --, do you?

18:30.206 --> 18:31.724
All I know is whoever it is,

18:31.724 --> 18:33.620
they want us in here together
just like this.

18:36.275 --> 18:38.551
Okay, I believe you.

18:38.551 --> 18:39.862
- Yeah.
- I believe you.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.551
- You should, Max,
'cuz I'm telling you

18:41.551 --> 18:43.137
the truth, all right,
this is not coincidence.

18:43.137 --> 18:44.862
Yeah, okay, okay,

18:44.862 --> 18:47.034
well, I guess we just have
to wait and see then, don't we?

18:47.034 --> 18:48.137
- Yes, we do.
- Yeah.

18:51.758 --> 18:53.344
Okay.

18:56.310 --> 18:58.586
They didn't eat much, huh?

18:58.586 --> 19:00.275
She didn't say anything.

19:00.275 --> 19:03.793
Smart lady.

19:03.793 --> 19:05.103
Priscilla...

19:05.103 --> 19:09.965
- Stop, you know I'm not gonna
kill that bitch.

19:09.965 --> 19:11.275
Do I?

19:11.275 --> 19:14.344
No, I'm not.

19:14.344 --> 19:17.275
- Well, maybe you should
maybe think about it.

19:17.275 --> 19:18.758
Killing her?

19:18.758 --> 19:21.620
- No, come on, you know
I wasn't gonna say that.

19:21.620 --> 19:25.620
Well, what is it then?

19:25.620 --> 19:28.000
- I think you should think about
taking some time off.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.103
I'm fine.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.068
Are you really?

19:32.068 --> 19:33.965
Yes.

19:33.965 --> 19:37.793
- Look, I don't like what you
and Sam are going through.

19:37.793 --> 19:41.137
- Have you thought about what
you and Nancy are going through?

19:41.137 --> 19:44.655
Oh, uh, we're fine.

19:44.655 --> 19:48.068
- Oh?
Well, that's new.

19:48.068 --> 19:49.551
Yes, it is.

19:49.551 --> 19:51.172
What changed that?

19:51.172 --> 19:54.862
- Oh, just know
that we are fine.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.482
Well, I'm glad.

19:56.482 --> 20:00.310
- Yeah, and I'd be glad if you
take a few days off.

20:00.310 --> 20:02.620
Not going to happen!

20:05.827 --> 20:07.103
Okay.

20:07.103 --> 20:08.827
Okay.

20:13.586 --> 20:16.344
You gotta go, don't you?

20:16.344 --> 20:17.827
I'm fine, sir.

20:17.827 --> 20:18.965
Dude, it's okay,

20:18.965 --> 20:21.172
you could just, like,
use my bathroom,

20:21.172 --> 20:22.379
it's really whatever.

20:22.379 --> 20:24.517
I told you, I'm fine.

20:24.517 --> 20:25.896
All right,

20:25.896 --> 20:28.931
well, you're gonna
have to go eventually.

20:31.413 --> 20:34.310
Hey, you like porn?

20:34.310 --> 20:35.862
Sir...

20:35.862 --> 20:38.000

some really great --.

20:41.275 --> 20:42.896
Sir...

20:42.896 --> 20:44.379
What?

20:44.379 --> 20:46.000
- You have been watching
that thing for hours,

20:46.000 --> 20:48.206
what are you trying to do?

20:48.206 --> 20:51.379
- I'm trying to get one off
in the privacy of my room,

20:51.379 --> 20:53.344
what does it look like
I'm tryna do?

20:53.344 --> 20:55.068
- Well, I wish
you would stop it.

20:55.068 --> 20:58.379
- Yeah, and I wish there wasn't
some random dude watching me

20:58.379 --> 21:00.413
every single time
I do any little tiny thing

21:00.413 --> 21:02.068
in my room, okay?

21:02.068 --> 21:03.448
Well, I'm sorry.

21:03.448 --> 21:05.137
Yeah.

21:05.137 --> 21:06.551
If you're gonna do this,

21:06.551 --> 21:08.034
and you're gonna
follow me around,

21:08.034 --> 21:09.551
I'm gonna do what I do.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.896
Yes, sir.

21:17.655 --> 21:20.689
- Her name is Rachel,
she's my favorite.

21:20.689 --> 21:23.931
You ever seen her before?

21:23.931 --> 21:26.482
- If you're tryna wear me down,
you won't,

21:26.482 --> 21:28.551
I've been in combat.

21:28.551 --> 21:32.827
- Oh, yeah,
let's talk about that.

21:32.827 --> 21:35.413
How many people have you killed?

21:35.413 --> 21:37.034
Sir, we don't have to talk.

21:39.034 --> 21:42.137
Okay.

21:42.137 --> 21:45.517
You know, just--just watching
you squirm like that

21:45.517 --> 21:47.275
makes me have to pee now.

21:47.275 --> 21:48.965
Okay.

21:48.965 --> 21:52.862
- Whoa! You're not coming
in there with me, are you?

21:52.862 --> 21:54.689

21:57.620 --> 21:59.896
Sir, I have to do my job.

21:59.896 --> 22:03.034

use the bathroom.

22:03.034 --> 22:05.517
Yes, I am.

22:05.517 --> 22:07.482
- This is bull --.

22:10.655 --> 22:14.103
What if I pissed on you?

22:14.103 --> 22:18.655
Sir, I wouldn't advise that.

22:18.655 --> 22:22.827
Hm...well...

22:27.103 --> 22:29.310
Too late.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.482
That's it, you're fired!

22:43.482 --> 22:44.827
Mom, where's dad?

22:46.862 --> 22:49.275
Not here.

22:49.275 --> 22:50.724
He hit me.

22:52.344 --> 22:53.689
What?

22:53.689 --> 22:56.034
I'm sorry, ma'am.

22:56.034 --> 22:58.517
Why did you hit him?

22:58.517 --> 23:00.137
Well, uh...

23:00.137 --> 23:02.965
Speak damn it.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.724
He was urinating on me, ma'am.

23:21.172 --> 23:23.586
Where's my dad?

23:23.586 --> 23:25.517
I'm asking you a question.

23:25.517 --> 23:28.275
I'll piss on your grave.

23:28.275 --> 23:31.448
Where's my dad?

23:31.448 --> 23:33.620
And you hit him?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.862
Yes, ma'am, I did.

23:35.862 --> 23:38.344
I don't believe you.

23:38.344 --> 23:39.827
Ma'am, I did.

24:17.689 --> 24:20.275
Oh, you call that a hit.

24:20.275 --> 24:23.275
Be about that life,
and punch this little bitch.

24:23.275 --> 24:26.310
- No, mom--
don't you do it, no, do you--

24:35.034 --> 24:39.689

just a little bit too hard.

24:39.689 --> 24:41.379

24:41.379 --> 24:44.000
No, no, no, no, don't be.

and get this girl

25:47.137 --> 25:49.758
- out of my house.
- Yes, ma'am, okay.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.206
- Now, Barry!
- Okay!

25:51.206 --> 25:54.310
- Who is that?
- Damn, ma!

25:54.310 --> 25:55.448
Mind your business.

25:55.448 --> 25:57.103
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay!

25:57.103 --> 25:59.137
Okay, okay, I'm coming.

25:59.137 --> 26:00.758
- Hurry up!
- BARRY: Okay.

26:04.551 --> 26:06.379
Jesus Christ.

26:12.310 --> 26:13.827
- BARRY: You all right?
- GIRL: Yeah.

26:13.827 --> 26:15.172
- BARRY: Okay,
where's your stuff at?

26:15.172 --> 26:17.241
- I'm coming.

26:20.172 --> 26:22.379
Come on, girl.

26:22.379 --> 26:24.103
- Go home!
- Ma...

26:24.103 --> 26:26.724
- What the hell, Barry?
- Ma, you need to chill out.

26:26.724 --> 26:28.310
Who is this girl?

26:28.310 --> 26:30.241
- Look, it doesn't matter
who she is.

26:30.241 --> 26:32.827
- Oh, so you just hook up
with some random girl?

26:35.965 --> 26:38.068
- Are you crazy?
- No, I'm not crazy, ma,

26:38.068 --> 26:39.689
Sharon isn't
feeling me right now.

26:41.034 --> 26:43.000
- You--you--you gotta move.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.551
I don't wanna move, ma.

26:44.551 --> 26:46.482
- Well, you're gonna have to
because I can't have no--

26:46.482 --> 26:48.379
you hooking up with no
random girls in my house.

26:48.379 --> 26:49.931
- Okay, fine--
- And until you move,

26:49.931 --> 26:52.517
- then you hook up at their house.
- Okay.

26:52.517 --> 26:54.827
- Fine!
- Fine!

26:54.827 --> 26:57.172
- And wash my damn sheets.
- Ma, really?

26:57.172 --> 26:59.379
- You know
I'm not -- washing them.

26:59.379 --> 27:01.172
- When you start using language
like that?

27:01.172 --> 27:02.827
- When you started bringing
people in my house.

27:02.827 --> 27:04.344
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay, fine.

27:04.344 --> 27:05.896
Fine!

27:05.896 --> 27:07.310
- You just wait 'til
your daddy gets home.

27:08.689 --> 27:11.241
- You--just wait.
- Okay, ma.

27:23.241 --> 27:24.620
Hello.

27:26.344 --> 27:27.758
First Lady...

27:27.758 --> 27:29.862
Yes?

27:29.862 --> 27:33.689
To what do I owe this visit?

27:36.344 --> 27:38.344
- I was watching the news
in my room,

27:38.344 --> 27:42.482
and you are doing a great job.

27:45.482 --> 27:47.413
Thank you.

27:47.413 --> 27:51.482
- I mean, you are spinning
and turning this thing around.

27:53.931 --> 27:56.965
Well, my strategy's working.

27:59.655 --> 28:01.068
You so stupid,

28:01.068 --> 28:04.586
you don't even know
sarcasm, do you?

28:04.586 --> 28:06.206
Ma'am...

28:06.206 --> 28:08.344
- This -- is a mess.

28:08.344 --> 28:12.758
It's on every channel,
attempted assassination,

28:12.758 --> 28:16.827
and everyone believes what
Dianne is saying about you,

28:16.827 --> 28:19.034
and yet, you seem to think

28:19.034 --> 28:23.206
you've got this -- show
under control.

28:23.206 --> 28:27.724
- Think I have this -- show
under control, let me see. I do.

28:29.034 --> 28:31.448
Yeah.

28:31.448 --> 28:34.000
You need to die.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.310
You need to leave.

28:36.310 --> 28:40.275
- And I don't mean
some old woman in a home,

28:40.275 --> 28:46.137
no, you need to die now.

28:46.137 --> 28:48.586
And I'm gonna make sure
that happens.

28:48.586 --> 28:51.172
Hm, okay.

28:52.413 --> 28:55.758
I don't take kindly
to threats, Mrs. Franklin.

28:55.758 --> 28:59.724
Oh, bitch,

28:59.724 --> 29:03.241
it's happening,
and it's done.

29:03.241 --> 29:07.000
You are gonna die
a painful death,

29:07.000 --> 29:09.862
and I know
just the person to do it.

29:09.862 --> 29:11.517
Hm.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.172
- If my husband
won't fire you,

29:14.172 --> 29:18.482
I'll make sure I do by stopping
your ability to breathe.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.551
That oughta do it.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.344
- Are you--are you done?

29:25.344 --> 29:28.965
You are, yes, you are.

29:28.965 --> 29:31.896
Okay...

29:31.896 --> 29:35.551
I should tell you
that, um,

29:39.862 --> 29:41.827
I'm not afraid of you.

29:44.172 --> 29:47.137
I don't want you to be.

29:47.137 --> 29:53.034
- That's great,
that--good,

29:53.034 --> 29:58.551
that is fantastic because you
can just stop coming down here

29:58.551 --> 30:03.344
with all...this bull --.

30:03.344 --> 30:09.103
- Yes, yes, yes, coming down,
stop coming d--

30:09.103 --> 30:13.034
I need to remember
to stop coming down

30:13.034 --> 30:18.344
from my status
to deal with the likes of you.

30:18.344 --> 30:23.448
It's low, disgusting,
and guttural.

30:26.586 --> 30:30.517
Is that all, ma'am?

30:30.517 --> 30:33.172
Yes, that's all.

30:33.172 --> 30:38.586
- 'K, well, thank you
so much for stopping by.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.620
Rest in hell, bitch.

30:49.241 --> 30:51.344
You wanted to see me, sir?

30:51.344 --> 30:52.551
Yeah.

30:54.344 --> 30:56.137
- Sir?
- Did they find him?

30:56.137 --> 30:58.862
Please, sit.

30:58.862 --> 31:00.206
Did they find him?

31:00.206 --> 31:01.689
Find who, sir?

31:05.827 --> 31:07.551
The guy who tried to kill me?

31:08.827 --> 31:10.586
Not yet.

31:10.586 --> 31:13.517
- What the hell's
taking so long, Donald?

31:13.517 --> 31:17.103
- Sir, trust me when I tell you,
we have the best on it.

31:21.241 --> 31:22.620
- Donald?
- DONALD: Yeah?

31:22.620 --> 31:24.275
- I'm starting
to get the feeling

31:24.275 --> 31:26.103
that you're not
taking me seriously.

31:26.103 --> 31:30.827
- Oh, sir, I always
take you seriously.

31:30.827 --> 31:33.517
Then why haven't we found him?

31:33.517 --> 31:36.655
- You know what, sir,
can--can I get you anything, hm?

31:36.655 --> 31:39.275
Yes!

31:39.275 --> 31:43.689
Victoria's dad's head
on a platter.

31:48.206 --> 31:52.034
- Can I tell you
something, sir, hm?

31:52.034 --> 31:53.517
Go ahead.

31:53.517 --> 31:56.310
- Well, I have it
on really good authority

31:56.310 --> 31:57.862
that he's not doing so well.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.724
- You have it on good authority?
- Yeah.

32:01.724 --> 32:03.551
- That he's not doing so well?
- Yes, sir.

32:03.551 --> 32:05.172
Donald, I already knew that.

32:05.172 --> 32:08.827
- No, I'm told that it could be
any day now, hm.

32:11.137 --> 32:13.586
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:13.586 --> 32:16.620
Yeah, maybe,

32:16.620 --> 32:19.620
or maybe that evil bastard
will live another four years

32:19.620 --> 32:21.620
just to spite me.

32:21.620 --> 32:26.034
- Well, sir that's exactly what
I wanted to talk to you about.

32:26.034 --> 32:27.517
What?

32:27.517 --> 32:29.172
Sir, there are a few people

32:29.172 --> 32:31.310
that I believe that we should
be aligning ourselves with.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.827
Like who?

32:34.827 --> 32:36.620
The Whitmore family, sir.

32:36.620 --> 32:38.551
- No, Donald,
that's not gonna happen.

32:38.551 --> 32:41.172
- Sir listen, you're gonna need
some solid allies

32:41.172 --> 32:42.655
when he passes.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.931
- Is her father
really that powerful?

32:47.931 --> 32:49.724
Yes sir, he is.

32:53.241 --> 32:55.827
And you're worried?

32:55.827 --> 32:59.758
- No, I'm concerned
that when he passes,

32:59.758 --> 33:03.931
there are gonna be a lot of
people with knives out for you,

33:03.931 --> 33:05.448
including your Vice President.

33:05.448 --> 33:08.758
- Oh, that moron couldn't figure
anything out.

33:08.758 --> 33:10.551
- Well, sir,
you never talk about him,

33:10.551 --> 33:12.068
you never invite him over.

33:12.068 --> 33:16.379
- Yeah, I don't like him
or his drab wife, nobody does.

33:16.379 --> 33:20.310
- Well, sir, his polling
is really, really high.

33:20.310 --> 33:23.241
Not as high as mine.

33:23.241 --> 33:25.965
Not as high as yours.

33:25.965 --> 33:28.344
Well, sir, in that case,

33:28.344 --> 33:31.172
I think you should keep
your enemies close

33:31.172 --> 33:33.620
and your wife closer, hm.

33:33.620 --> 33:37.344
- My wife is the only enemy
I need to worry about.

33:37.344 --> 33:39.103
- Sir, we need
to be prepared, okay?

33:39.103 --> 33:44.103
Her mom has already passed,
when her father goes...oh.

33:44.103 --> 33:46.896
- All right, all right,
all right, I hear you, Donald.

33:46.896 --> 33:49.482
Okay, then hear this...

33:49.482 --> 33:51.137
we need to start aligning
ourselves

33:51.137 --> 33:52.482
with the Whitmore family,

33:52.482 --> 33:54.413
so that your Vice President
knows

33:54.413 --> 33:56.206
that we have strong allies,

33:56.206 --> 33:59.655
and he won't try
to make a move, hm.

33:59.655 --> 34:02.931
We'll let him pee his pants.

34:02.931 --> 34:04.413
I hear you.

34:04.413 --> 34:09.034
- Good, well sir,
I just wanted to let you know

34:09.034 --> 34:12.000
what I was thinking, hm.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.344
Okay.

34:15.206 --> 34:19.310
Any chance you can find the guy
that tried to kill me?

34:19.310 --> 34:21.379
- You know what,
I'll work on it for you, sir.

34:21.379 --> 34:24.275
- Thank you.
- Right now.

34:24.275 --> 34:26.310
Let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

34:26.310 --> 34:29.034
- Just that, Donald.
- Yeah.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.034
- Don't need to align myself
with the Whitmore family

34:31.034 --> 34:33.068
if I'm not here.

34:33.068 --> 34:34.827
- You're not
going anywhere, sir.

34:43.448 --> 34:45.103
Where are you?

34:45.103 --> 34:47.206
Fifteen minutes, sir.

34:47.206 --> 34:49.758
All right, I'm in the Oval.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.551
Excuse me?

35:06.965 --> 35:09.689
Ma'am...

35:09.689 --> 35:11.000
Now...

35:12.379 --> 35:13.896
Where are you going?

35:13.896 --> 35:15.379
Home, ma'am.

35:15.379 --> 35:18.827
- Oh, to handle
our little problem?

35:18.827 --> 35:22.827
- No, I told you
that I'm not doing that.

35:22.827 --> 35:24.482
Yes, you will.

35:24.482 --> 35:27.379
Ma'am...

35:27.379 --> 35:32.482
- Okay, well enjoy
your ride home.

35:32.482 --> 35:36.241
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

35:36.241 --> 35:37.793
Is that a threat?

35:40.241 --> 35:42.034
Yes.

35:42.034 --> 35:44.931
- Okay, look, why are you
doing this to me?

35:44.931 --> 35:50.000
- Oh honey,
I'm helping you.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.103
You're special.

35:52.103 --> 35:53.862
- Special?
- Yes.

35:53.862 --> 35:57.172
- This is what you do to people
that are special to you?

35:57.172 --> 36:01.000
Yeah, you're fortunate.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.241
I am going to make
a man out of you yet.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.137
- So now beating women,
that's manly?

36:12.137 --> 36:15.896
No, that's for bitches.

36:15.896 --> 36:19.620
- So then, why are you
telling me to beat Ellie?

36:19.620 --> 36:25.275
- I'm not
telling you to do that,

36:25.275 --> 36:27.551
I'm telling you to kill her.

36:27.551 --> 36:30.068
Are you insane?

36:33.517 --> 36:38.482
Yes, yes, very much so.

36:38.482 --> 36:40.482
Ma'am...

36:40.482 --> 36:43.793
- You'll do what I say,
one way or another.

36:45.413 --> 36:47.862
- You can count on it
not happening.

36:51.103 --> 36:56.034
- Then as I said,
enjoy your ride home.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.241
Ma'am ...

37:11.241 --> 37:14.137
Sam...

37:14.137 --> 37:15.896
Are you okay?

37:15.896 --> 37:19.000
- Of course,
why wouldn't I be?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.862
Well, your son.

37:20.862 --> 37:23.241
Oh that whatever.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.862
Ma'am?

37:24.862 --> 37:29.103
- Sam, I'm just kidding,
he's fine.

37:29.103 --> 37:30.551
Yes, ma'am.

37:32.275 --> 37:35.379
Are you following me?

37:35.379 --> 37:38.241
Loosely, ma'am.

37:38.241 --> 37:40.344
And why is that?

37:40.344 --> 37:42.862
We're in the White House.

37:42.862 --> 37:45.931
- I just wanna be sure
you're safe.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.965
Are you worried about me?

37:49.965 --> 37:51.655
- No, ma'am,
nothing to worry about.

37:54.551 --> 37:57.482
Is it your wife?

37:57.482 --> 37:58.793
No, ma'am.

38:00.551 --> 38:02.379
Are you sure?

38:02.379 --> 38:03.724
Yes, ma'am.

38:05.551 --> 38:08.586
- No, I think it is,
it's your wife.

38:08.586 --> 38:11.000
It's not.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.724
- Tell me, how does
she know my father?

38:17.793 --> 38:21.068
I didn't know she did, ma'am.

38:21.068 --> 38:22.931
Really?

38:24.448 --> 38:29.413
Okay, I see I'm not gonna get
anything out of you, am I?

38:29.413 --> 38:32.586
No, ma'am.

38:32.586 --> 38:36.758
- Well, you can
keep following me,

38:36.758 --> 38:39.862
I'm sure you enjoy
the view from behind.

38:57.827 --> 38:59.275
Hey, just wait here,

38:59.275 --> 39:01.482
I'll get you a drink of water
or something.

39:01.482 --> 39:03.551
I don't want any water.

39:03.551 --> 39:05.517
Then have a seat.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.724
I don't wanna sit, I'll stand.

39:11.655 --> 39:14.413
Hi!

39:14.413 --> 39:16.862
Hello, sir.

39:16.862 --> 39:19.862
What happened to you?

39:19.862 --> 39:22.379
She didn't wanna come, sir.

39:22.379 --> 39:24.344
What?

39:24.344 --> 39:26.275
Didn't wanna come.

39:26.275 --> 39:27.793
Yeah, but she's here.

39:27.793 --> 39:29.310
Yes, sir.

39:31.344 --> 39:35.862
Kyle, what did you do?

39:35.862 --> 39:38.517
I brought her to you, sir.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.724
Kyle, what the hell?

39:40.724 --> 39:42.241
He forced me to come here.

39:42.241 --> 39:45.413
- What--are you out
of your mind?

39:45.413 --> 39:46.655
I just wanna go home.

39:46.655 --> 39:48.482
- Ab--are you okay?

39:48.482 --> 39:50.827
Kyle, what were you thinking?

39:50.827 --> 39:52.310
- You said
you wanted to see her.

39:54.586 --> 39:56.310
Kyle, this is America.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.827
Exactly!

39:57.827 --> 40:02.172
- You can't just go--go
kidnapping someone.

40:02.172 --> 40:05.172
Look, apologize.

40:05.172 --> 40:07.206
I'm sorry.

40:07.206 --> 40:10.241
- Look, um,
are you sure you're okay?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.724
- I'm fine,
I just need to go home.

40:12.724 --> 40:15.034
- Absolutely, and he--he's
gonna take you home,

40:15.034 --> 40:17.068
but I--I just need
to talk to you.

40:17.068 --> 40:22.206
This would--this is bad,
this is really, really bad.

40:22.206 --> 40:24.103
I'm sorry.

40:24.103 --> 40:26.655
- I'm--if anyone thought that
he was just following orders,

40:26.655 --> 40:29.551
it would--it would really be
horrible for me.

40:29.551 --> 40:31.000
Are you sure you're okay?

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
- Yes, can I--can I
just leave, please?

40:33.000 --> 40:35.137
- He's--he's gonna take you home
in just a second.

40:35.137 --> 40:36.620
Okay.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.241
- Actually, you know what,
you're a mess,

40:38.241 --> 40:40.344
why don't--why don't you go
clean yourself up,

40:40.344 --> 40:42.034
think about what you did.

40:42.034 --> 40:43.551
Yes, sir.

40:43.551 --> 40:45.034
I'm so disappointed in you.

40:45.034 --> 40:46.689
- Yeah, while--while
we're waiting for him,

40:46.689 --> 40:48.344
maybe we can just
step into the Oval,

40:48.344 --> 40:49.931
and I can just kinda tell you

40:49.931 --> 40:51.724
what I was--what I was wanting
to talk to you about.

40:51.724 --> 40:53.172
- Uh--
- Do you want a drink,

40:53.172 --> 40:55.379
it's been a long day,
a really long day?

40:55.379 --> 40:57.241
- I'm--I'm fine.
- You sure?

40:57.241 --> 40:58.586
Can I have a drink?

40:58.586 --> 41:00.172
He'll--he'll be back
in a second,

41:00.172 --> 41:01.862
and then he'll take you
right home.

41:01.862 --> 41:03.482
- No!
- I--I do, I mean,

41:03.482 --> 41:06.034
it's been--it's been a day.
I'm--I'm done with this day.

41:06.034 --> 41:07.896
Come on, why don't
you just come back,

41:07.896 --> 41:10.000
we'll just have a drink,
and we'll wait for Kyle.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.137
Kyle can pick you up,
it'll be all good.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.896
Come on.

41:14.896 --> 41:17.206
You seen the Oval office, right?

41:17.206 --> 41:18.655
No, I haven't.

41:18.655 --> 41:20.448
- That's right,
you didn't your tour.

41:36.241 --> 41:37.586
What up?

41:37.586 --> 41:40.206
- ALLAN: Mother --.

41:41.758 --> 41:43.448
- MALE NARRATOR:
Next on, "The Oval."

41:43.448 --> 41:44.827
I like you.

41:44.827 --> 41:46.103
- Just because
you're the President,

41:46.103 --> 41:48.034
doesn't mean that you
can do this to me.

41:48.034 --> 41:49.689
- Just do what
she's telling you to do.

41:49.689 --> 41:51.206
Okay!

41:51.206 --> 41:53.275
- Your son needs to talk to you.
- What's going on?

41:53.275 --> 41:55.655
- I don't trust you.
- That's fine.

41:55.655 --> 41:57.206
You don't trust me?

41:57.206 --> 42:00.896
- He's a kid.
- He's a monster.

42:00.896 --> 42:02.620
And I am tired of your lies,

42:02.620 --> 42:04.172
I'm tired of your bull --.

42:04.172 --> 42:06.275
Why did you have him
at the White House?

42:06.275 --> 42:08.068
- You know you're
in danger, right?

42:08.068 --> 42:09.862
- If you're gonna do
something to me, Allan,

42:09.862 --> 42:11.379
then just do it,
but do not threaten me.
