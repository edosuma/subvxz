00:07.083 --> 00:08.291
COLLEEN:
This is so exciting.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.792
We have to remember this.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.333
Every day is full
of these different moments

00:11.417 --> 00:13.208
that can change our destiny.

00:13.291 --> 00:15.291
You know I'm just masturbating
into this cup, right?

00:15.375 --> 00:17.417
Stop taking the romance
out of it.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.834
You're extracting your semen
to be evaluated in a laboratory.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.250
It's beautiful.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.667
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. Either way,

00:23.750 --> 00:25.125
-we're both pulling
for our family, right?
-Mm-hmm.

00:25.208 --> 00:26.583
Should we take a selfie
with the sample cup?

00:26.667 --> 00:27.959
No, no, no. Colleen, this
actually isn't for public...

00:28.041 --> 00:30.417
-Yay! (chuckles)
-(groans)

00:30.500 --> 00:32.000
Now, are you sure
that this wouldn't be easier

00:32.083 --> 00:33.250
for you in a clinic?

00:33.333 --> 00:34.291
No, no.
That's way too much pressure.

00:34.375 --> 00:35.375
-I need to do it here.
-Okay.

00:35.458 --> 00:36.667
And you need
to leave the door open

00:36.750 --> 00:38.417
so that I can get
a good Wi-Fi signal.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.208
Okay. Just remember,
you only have 30 minutes.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.333
-Right.
-Well, 30 minutes once it's
in that cup, but you have

00:43.417 --> 00:45.417
as long as it's gonna take
you to get it in the cup.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.250
-But then only 30 minutes once
it's in that cup, otherwise...
-Colleen!

00:47.333 --> 00:48.583
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go to work,

00:48.667 --> 00:49.792
and I'll leave you to it.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.500
-Okay.
-30 minutes to get
to the clinic.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.291
Bye.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.166
(phone beeps)

01:02.583 --> 01:03.709
(gasps)

01:13.208 --> 01:15.375
(phone ringing)

01:18.875 --> 01:20.333
Hello.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.875
Matt?

01:23.959 --> 01:25.750
Hey, Heather. I can't really
talk right now. What's up?

01:25.834 --> 01:27.125
Yeah, you know what? I-I think
something's wrong with me.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.166
I think I have that thing,
you know, where you have

01:29.250 --> 01:31.291
lava in your chest.
You know that lava thing?

01:31.375 --> 01:33.750
Yeah. No, I don't.
I don't know "the lava thing."

01:33.834 --> 01:35.250
<i>It's like you're pregnant,</i>

01:35.333 --> 01:37.375
but it's in your chest,
and instead of a baby,

01:37.458 --> 01:39.000
it's like a thousand hot knives.

01:39.083 --> 01:40.542
<i>Call Tim.</i>

01:40.625 --> 01:41.875
Isn't this the point
of marrying a doctor?

01:41.959 --> 01:43.750
To call him with all sorts
of fake emergencies?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.083
No. No, his phone's off.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.333
He's at the eye doctor.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.166
Oh...

01:48.250 --> 01:50.333
I think I'm gonna need you
to take me to the hospital.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.250
Okay, well,
what about Mom or Greg?

01:52.333 --> 01:53.542
<i>No, no. They're taking Dad</i>

01:53.625 --> 01:55.166
to get his colonoscopy.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.667
You know what?
I-It's fine. It's fine.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.625
It's fine.
I'm just gonna lay here,

01:58.709 --> 02:01.417
right on this nice,
cool concrete.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.458
Oh! That's good.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.583
Heather, I think you need
to call 911.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.917
What? And cause a whole scene?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.834
No way. That is so embarrassing.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.792
But just... Hi, please,
just go around me.

02:10.875 --> 02:12.000
Thank you.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.667
<i>Just, yep. Go around.</i>

02:13.750 --> 02:15.417
<i>You can do it.</i>

02:15.500 --> 02:17.834
<i>-(moans)</i>
-Okay. Okay.

02:17.917 --> 02:19.583
I'm coming to get you.
Where are you?

02:22.709 --> 02:24.959
All right,
what does the Internet say?

02:25.041 --> 02:26.583
It says heart attack.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.500
Okay, yeah, that-that's
actually not funny.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.291
No, Matt. Seriously,
it-it says heart attack.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.625
I'm sure it's just indigestion.

02:34.709 --> 02:36.875
Yeah, I know.
You're probably right.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.875
All right,
if something happens to me,

02:39.959 --> 02:41.333
please don't let Tim remarry.

02:41.417 --> 02:43.333
Okay... first of all,
you're fine.

02:43.417 --> 02:44.875
Second of all,
Tim has always said

02:44.959 --> 02:46.375
that if anything
ever happened to you,

02:46.458 --> 02:48.375
he was gonna get
a Japanese sex robot.

02:48.458 --> 02:50.250
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, he wants to be able

02:50.333 --> 02:52.125
to fart whenever he wants to.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.250
Oh, he's a good man.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.834
Okay, there's something else
I have to tell you.

02:58.959 --> 03:00.834
I have been pretending to be

03:00.917 --> 03:04.417
a girl from high school

03:04.500 --> 03:06.709
that still has a crush on Greg.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.291
You're Haley Haslett?

03:08.375 --> 03:09.500
Yeah.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.000
He's been bragging about her
for years.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.500
Oh, God. I know.

03:12.583 --> 03:16.125
And I had such
a spectacular endgame.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.375
I was gonna

03:17.458 --> 03:19.500
have Haley go missing,

03:19.583 --> 03:22.208
and Greg was the only one
who could put the clues together

03:22.291 --> 03:24.125
to find her,
and now I'm not gonna be alive

03:24.208 --> 03:25.750
to see the prank through.

03:25.834 --> 03:28.291
No. No, I am never
gonna let that happen.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.083
-(pats hands)
-Okay.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.458
(panting)

03:31.542 --> 03:32.667
What's in the bag?
Is that a candy?

03:32.750 --> 03:34.000
No, no, no, no, no, no. You...

03:34.083 --> 03:36.000
No. Don't worry about it.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.333
HEATHER:
<i>Matt.</i>

03:37.417 --> 03:38.625
I think you're gonna
have to make

03:38.709 --> 03:40.000
some tough decisions today.

03:40.083 --> 03:41.583
I'm never gonna let you suffer.

03:41.667 --> 03:44.125
No, no. I want you
to let me suffer, okay?

03:44.208 --> 03:46.417
You plug me into
any machine that they have.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.709
All right?
I don't care what kind

03:47.792 --> 03:49.542
of financial burden it causes.

03:49.625 --> 03:53.250
You plug me into a frickin' fax
machine if that keeps me alive.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.917
-You got it?
-Okay. Hey.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.750
Can we get a doctor in here?

03:58.792 --> 04:01.375
I never told Tim's mom
what I really think of her.

04:02.417 --> 04:04.166
She is lovely.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.166
-She really is.
-I had all these things

04:06.250 --> 04:07.834
that I was gonna do
and, you know, I never even

04:07.917 --> 04:09.250
finished college.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.917
Yeah, but you got Tyler
out of that.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.250
Yeah, I know, I know. But you
can't hang him on the wall.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.959
I mean, I can, but no one
would be impressed with that.

04:16.041 --> 04:17.250
Good news, Mrs. Hughes.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.667
You're not dying.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.333
-What?
-Looks like your symptoms

04:20.417 --> 04:22.375
were a result of acid reflux.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.667
-(sighs)
-Acid reflux?
-Probably due

04:24.750 --> 04:26.083
to the coffee you had this
morning, and the red wine

04:26.166 --> 04:28.083
you "hit pretty hard
last night."

04:28.166 --> 04:30.709
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was red wine Wednesday.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.750
-It was Tuesday.
-That's right. Red wine Tuesday.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.917
Heather, I asked you
if you ate anything weird.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.917
Matt, you don't eat wine.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.125
Well, you two are free to go,

04:38.208 --> 04:39.834
unless you have
any other questions.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.709
(phone beeping)

04:42.792 --> 04:44.792
(tongue clicks)

04:44.875 --> 04:47.709
Can I throw bodily fluids
in that trash can?

04:47.792 --> 04:49.250
No.

04:49.333 --> 04:52.583
-What?
-Nah. Don't worry about it.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.166
COLLEEN:
This is so exciting.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.834
We have to remember this.

04:58.917 --> 05:00.458
Every day is full
of these different moments

05:00.542 --> 05:02.417
that can change our destiny.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.583
You know I'm just masturbating
into this cup, right?

05:04.667 --> 05:05.875
-Should we take a selfie
with the sample cup?
-No, no, no.

05:05.959 --> 05:07.083
Colleen, this actually
isn't for public...

05:07.166 --> 05:08.834
-(groans)
-Yay!

05:08.917 --> 05:10.333
30 minutes to get to the clinic.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.917
Bye.

05:12.959 --> 05:15.000
(phone beeps)

05:17.875 --> 05:18.959
(gasps)

05:25.291 --> 05:27.417
(phone ringing)

05:30.959 --> 05:32.083
Hello.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.375
Hey, Matt.
Need some help here, pal.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.625
Um, I just got Dad back
from his colonoscopy, and, uh,

05:39.709 --> 05:42.583
he's acting a little loopy.

05:42.667 --> 05:45.208
Why isn't this escalator moving?

05:45.291 --> 05:47.125
Oh. Oh, there she goes.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.250
So have Mom watch him.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.375
<i>Well, she was</i>
<i>so worried about Dad</i>

05:49.458 --> 05:50.792
<i>that I'm afraid that she took</i>

05:50.875 --> 05:53.083
a little too much
of her anti-anxiety medicine.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.583
You okay, Mom?

05:57.041 --> 05:58.000
You'll be fine.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.500
Uh... I have a Skype meeting

05:59.583 --> 06:01.750
in five minutes with a company
that wants to buy CryTunes,

06:01.834 --> 06:04.041
and I don't want to blow it,
Matt. All right?

06:04.125 --> 06:06.709
I-I-- they're gonna let me
keep my face on the box.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.667
Sorry, man. I got 30 minutes
to get some sperm to a clinic.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.709
That's my own sperm,
to be clear.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.208
Okay, yeah. I just need ten.

06:13.291 --> 06:14.625
That's all I need, all right?

06:14.709 --> 06:16.500
Come on. This is our mom
and dad here, all right?

06:16.583 --> 06:19.166
So just come on over,
throw the oven mitts on,

06:19.250 --> 06:21.333
and just lock 'em
in the coat closet.

06:21.417 --> 06:22.500
Why can't you do it?

06:22.583 --> 06:23.917
Because I don't want my face

06:24.000 --> 06:25.625
to get scratched, Matt.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.959
Okay. Fine.

06:34.583 --> 06:37.834
So now the elevator is broken,
too?

06:37.917 --> 06:40.542
Why did we even buy
this building, Joanie?

06:43.792 --> 06:45.083
Mom?

06:45.166 --> 06:46.667
Oh! There you are.
Thank you so much for your help.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.583
Yeah, you got ten minutes.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.083
I'm gonna close this deal
in three.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.875
Hey, you can close
your deal all you want,

06:51.959 --> 06:54.458
but they're still gonna get
a camera up in there.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.834
Well, I would be happy to stay
on board as a consultant,

06:58.917 --> 07:01.250
provided my face is still
on that box.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.083
<i>Do you think you'd have time</i>
<i>to consult?</i>

07:03.166 --> 07:04.542
Oh, I am 100% dedicated

07:04.625 --> 07:06.291
<i>to this product.</i>

07:06.375 --> 07:09.542
<i>I mean, it's my baby, except</i>
<i>one that I am willing to sell.</i>

07:09.625 --> 07:11.709
<i>You know, in fact,</i>
<i>I can't think of a single thing</i>

07:11.792 --> 07:14.667
<i>that would take my focus away</i>
<i>from this company.</i>

07:14.750 --> 07:17.583
<i>Greg, do you have</i>
<i>any ChapStick?</i>

07:17.667 --> 07:19.750
<i>You got to wet my lips.</i>

07:19.834 --> 07:20.959
MATT:
<i>Okay, Dad. Here we go.</i>

07:21.041 --> 07:22.083
<i>Here we go. Come on.</i>

07:22.166 --> 07:23.208
<i>-Here we go.</i>
<i>-Oh!</i>

07:23.291 --> 07:24.667
<i>You have wet lips. Kiss me.</i>

07:24.750 --> 07:26.000
<i>-Okay...</i>
<i>-Kiss your daddy.</i>

07:26.083 --> 07:28.041
<i>-Kiss me.</i>
<i>-Okay, well...</i>

07:28.125 --> 07:30.792
<i>I guess this is</i>
<i>the uncomfortable moment</i>

07:30.875 --> 07:33.959
<i>when we start talking</i>
<i>about money. So...</i>

07:34.041 --> 07:35.125
Perhaps we should reschedule
when you have

07:35.208 --> 07:36.166
a bit more privacy.

07:36.250 --> 07:37.500
<i>Oh, no, no. Now is fine.</i>

07:37.583 --> 07:39.875
<i>My dad is just recuperating</i>
<i>from a procedure.</i>

07:39.959 --> 07:41.291
What about the woman?

07:41.375 --> 07:43.000
<i>Huh? Mom!</i>

07:43.083 --> 07:44.542
<i>I'm in the middle</i>
<i>of an interview.</i>

07:44.625 --> 07:45.583
JOAN:
<i>Oh, did you tell them</i>

07:45.667 --> 07:47.875
about your tail?

07:47.959 --> 07:49.834
<i>Is she also recovering</i>
<i>from a procedure?</i>

07:49.917 --> 07:51.458
No, I just took drugs.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.583
Do I have something in my eye?

07:53.667 --> 07:55.000
<i>-Mom. Mom.</i>
<i>-Okay, here we go, Mom.</i>

07:55.083 --> 07:56.291
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>
<i>Sorry about that, Greg.</i>

07:56.375 --> 07:57.375
<i>-Oh. Oh.</i>
<i>-Come on. Here we go.</i>

07:57.458 --> 07:58.667
<i>We're gonna go for a walk.</i>

07:58.750 --> 08:00.125
<i>(clears throat)</i>
<i>Very sorry about that.</i>

08:00.208 --> 08:01.208
<i>Won't happen again.</i>

08:01.291 --> 08:03.417
<i>Who put sperm in my lunch bag?</i>

08:03.500 --> 08:05.125
<i>Greggy, was that you?</i>

08:05.208 --> 08:06.875
<i>Okay, that's it! Everybody out!</i>

08:06.959 --> 08:08.625
<i>Everyone out, right...</i>

08:08.709 --> 08:10.458
<i>Dad, that's actually mine. Can</i>
<i>you, um, please give it to me?</i>

08:10.500 --> 08:11.625
<i>-I need to get it to the clinic.</i>
<i>-What? What?</i>

08:11.667 --> 08:14.417
<i>Oh. Oh. Nobody clones my son.</i>

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
<i>-(grunts)</i>
<i>-(crunches)</i>
<i>-No! No!</i>

08:19.291 --> 08:21.542
<i>So, do we still have the deal?</i>

08:26.917 --> 08:28.959
You know I'm just masturbating
into this cup, right?

08:29.041 --> 08:30.291
-Should we take a selfie
with the sample cup?
-No, no, no.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.500
Colleen, this actually
isn't for public...

08:31.583 --> 08:33.250
-(groans)
-Yay!

08:33.333 --> 08:34.667
30 minutes to get to the clinic.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.125
Bye.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.333
(phone ringing)

08:43.417 --> 08:44.750
Hello.

08:44.834 --> 08:46.750
MAN:
<i>May I speak with Mr.</i>
<i>or Mrs. Shirt, please?</i>

08:46.834 --> 08:49.500
It's "Short," and no.
No, not today.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.500
You know what? You've called me
every single day this week.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.333
My own mother doesn't
even call me this much.

08:53.417 --> 08:54.834
<i>Maybe that's because</i>
<i>your mother doesn't care</i>

08:54.917 --> 08:56.834
<i>about you overpaying</i>
<i>for car insurance.</i>

08:56.917 --> 08:58.875
I actually think
that that would bother her,

08:58.959 --> 09:00.417
but what I'm most interested in
is getting you

09:00.500 --> 09:02.208
to take me
off of your call list.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.500
<i>I wish I could,</i>
<i>but my manager won't allow that</i>

09:04.583 --> 09:07.500
<i>until you've sat through the</i>
<i>entire sales pitch, Mr. Shirt.</i>

09:07.583 --> 09:09.583
-It's "Short."
<i>-Yes, it'll be very short.</i>

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
<i>And if you sign up today,</i>

09:13.083 --> 09:14.959
<i>we'll even throw in</i>
<i>a plush doll of our mascot,</i>

09:15.041 --> 09:16.542
<i>Crashy the Car.</i>

09:16.625 --> 09:18.834
Okay, uh, I think I've heard
enough. Thank you.

09:18.917 --> 09:21.500
<i>That's great. I'm glad</i>
<i>I've piqued your interest.</i>

09:21.583 --> 09:23.500
No, you haven't piqued anything.
I'm just trying to get the...

09:23.583 --> 09:26.083
(crashes)

09:26.166 --> 09:27.375
(coughing)

09:30.834 --> 09:32.000
(phone ringing)

09:32.083 --> 09:33.792
Can't see who it is.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.000
Should I answer?

09:35.083 --> 09:36.875
Yeah, it's important.

09:36.959 --> 09:39.959
Dr. Tim Hughes, what's the news?

09:40.041 --> 09:42.583
Tim, it's Matt. Look,
I'm really sorry to be a bother,

09:42.667 --> 09:44.583
but I-I've tried everyone else.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.875
Hey, Mattie. Sorry, brother,
I can't see the phone.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.208
I'm at the ophthalmologist.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.208
He dilated my eyes real good.

09:50.291 --> 09:52.375
Okay, that's great.
Hey, Tim, listen... (stammers)

09:52.458 --> 09:54.875
In every brother-in-law's life,
there comes a moment

09:54.959 --> 09:57.458
when he's asked
for a sperm-related favor.

09:57.542 --> 09:59.417
I'm listening.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.000
I was in a car accident.
I'm fine, but I need you

10:02.083 --> 10:04.291
to get my sperm sample
to the clinic in the next...

10:05.792 --> 10:07.792
...22 minutes.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.208
Having listened,
I'm now saying no.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.208
Sorry, I can't
legally drive a car

10:11.291 --> 10:13.750
for the next hour,
even if it's an emergency.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.750
I'll drive.
I have my learner's permit.

10:15.834 --> 10:16.875
No, you're not ready.

10:16.959 --> 10:18.291
According to the state, I am.

10:18.375 --> 10:19.500
What the hell
does the state know?

10:19.583 --> 10:20.667
They gave me a medical license.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.917
Dad, please!

10:22.000 --> 10:22.959
Tim, please.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.750
Both of you, stop whining.

10:24.834 --> 10:27.458
Look, Tim, if you don't get this
sample to the clinic in time,

10:27.542 --> 10:29.458
there will be millions
of potential lives

10:29.542 --> 10:32.041
that will be on your head.
You took an oath, Tim.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.875
(groans) Why does everybody
keep throwing

10:33.959 --> 10:35.792
that stupid oath in my face?
Fine.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.667
Yes.

10:37.750 --> 10:42.000
Yes, but I'm gonna be
watching you like a hawk.

10:42.083 --> 10:45.750
(laughs) Nice catch.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.834
(Tim screams)

10:47.917 --> 10:49.000
-Whoa.
-What?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.041
Oh. Thought I saw something.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.125
You can't see anything.

10:52.208 --> 10:53.667
I can make out shapes.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.792
(Tim screams)

10:55.875 --> 10:58.333
Sorry. I forgot I turned
the seat heater on.

10:58.417 --> 11:00.291
I thought I wet myself.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.792
(car horn honks)

11:05.625 --> 11:07.875
What took you guys so long?

11:07.959 --> 11:09.250
Dad won't let me drive
like a normal person.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.500
He's being insane.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.166
I'm the one who's being insane?

11:12.250 --> 11:13.542
You're the one who drove
through a family of ducks

11:13.625 --> 11:14.792
on the way over here.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.417
That was an old box of muffins.

11:16.500 --> 11:18.166
Now it's a box
of dead muffins, Sam.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.208
Guys!

11:19.291 --> 11:20.875
If you don't get this
to the clinic

11:20.959 --> 11:22.041
in the next seven minutes,

11:22.125 --> 11:24.417
the future of my family will die
in a plastic cup.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.583
I can make it.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.709
No, she can't.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.417
I got a learner's permit
to learn.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.709
If you're not gonna teach me,

11:29.792 --> 11:31.375
I guess I'll just
have to teach myself.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.458
Six minutes.
I believe in you, Sam.

11:35.959 --> 11:39.208
Samantha.
Don't do anything crazy.

11:39.291 --> 11:42.834
Put your glasses back on, Dad.
I'm in charge now.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.417
Son of a bitch,
you're actually doing it.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.083
-(laughs)
-(loud thump)

11:51.166 --> 11:53.375
Oops.

11:53.458 --> 11:56.041
What do you mean "oops"?
More muffins?

11:56.125 --> 11:58.208
Yeah. Muffins.

11:58.291 --> 12:01.166
Well, just stop next time.
I can get out and get 'em.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.208
SAMANTHA:
Ooh, look at that space.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.250
TIM:
Easy!

12:05.333 --> 12:06.625
SAMANTHA:
Don't worry. I got this.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.875
Great job, Sam.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.875
We made it with time to spare.

12:10.959 --> 12:12.959
Let's get Uncle Matt's
blood to the doctor.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.875
Hey.

12:14.959 --> 12:16.542
It's time I start treating you
like more of an adult,

12:16.625 --> 12:17.792
so you need to know

12:17.875 --> 12:19.458
that's not Uncle Matt's
blood sample in the bag.

12:19.542 --> 12:20.792
Then what is it?

12:20.875 --> 12:25.667
It's his, uh... man sample.

12:25.750 --> 12:27.875
Ew! Oh, my God.

12:27.959 --> 12:29.125
All right. Look, it...

12:29.208 --> 12:31.208
-Oh, no.
-What?

12:31.291 --> 12:32.834
I left the seat heater on.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.750
Is that bad?

12:34.834 --> 12:38.208
You remember when I cranked up
the heat on Sophia's fish tank?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.542
Oh, yeah.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.834
Too bad we can't replace
it without him knowing.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.709
Yeah, this batter is toast.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.166
(sighs)

12:46.250 --> 12:49.333
But you know what?
We can still go get ice cream.

12:49.417 --> 12:52.291
Yeah! Hurry up!
They close in 30 minutes.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.917
You know I'm just masturbating
into this cup, right?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.917
-(camera clicks)
-30 minutes to get to the clinic.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.041
Bye.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.166
(phone ringing)

13:11.250 --> 13:12.458
Hello.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.208
-COLLEEN: <i>Hi!</i>
-Don't worry, it's done.

13:15.291 --> 13:16.709
<i>The score is officially</i>

13:16.792 --> 13:19.083
Matt one, little tiny cup...
two.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.959
Th-There were some
stops and starts.

13:21.041 --> 13:24.250
Well, I'm just calling because I
think I maybe left the stove on.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.709
<i>Sorry, these fertility drugs</i>

13:25.792 --> 13:27.333
<i>are really messing</i>
<i>with my head.</i>

13:27.417 --> 13:30.375
Mm, dang it! My wisdom tooth
grew back in again.

13:30.458 --> 13:31.750
The stove is not on.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.500
COLLEEN:
<i>Okay, great. Is the curling iron off?</i>

13:33.583 --> 13:34.875
Uh... (chuckles)
You know what?

13:34.959 --> 13:36.166
I'm actually kind of working on

13:36.250 --> 13:38.667
a little bit of a schedule
here, uh, Colleen.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.583
Are you sure you left
the curling iron on? Or...

13:40.667 --> 13:41.750
Yes, for sure.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.750
<i>Maybe. Probably not,</i>

13:43.834 --> 13:44.834
<i>but can you check anyway?</i>

13:44.917 --> 13:46.208
See? This is a fun preview

13:46.291 --> 13:47.750
of what it's gonna be like
when I'm pregnant.

13:47.834 --> 13:48.875
-Oh, good.
<i>-Wait, wait, wait.</i>

13:48.959 --> 13:50.166
Matt, how does the sample look?

13:50.250 --> 13:52.125
Does it look like they're
gonna be good babies?

13:52.208 --> 13:54.041
Yes, Colleen, they all look
like they're gonna be the best.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.333
<i>I know the answer's</i>
<i>gonna be no,</i>

13:55.417 --> 13:57.333
<i>but will you please take</i>
<i>a picture for Mommy?</i>

13:57.417 --> 13:58.625
No.

13:58.709 --> 14:02.000
I'm off to work, Matt.
Don't touch my stuff.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.500
Uh, Dougie, please tell me
there's a PG-rated reason

14:27.583 --> 14:29.667
you're squatting
behind that plant.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.208
I'm hiding.

14:31.291 --> 14:34.000
Someone's stealing my lunch
and I'm gonna find out who.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.959
You know what? Someone stole
my yogurt last week,

14:37.041 --> 14:38.625
and it really pissed me off.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.750
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

14:40.834 --> 14:43.125
I'm gonna bring this lunch thief
to his knees!

14:43.208 --> 14:44.250
Uh-huh.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.583
I know everyone underestimates
me around here

14:46.667 --> 14:49.458
'cause I'm just
a dumb paralegal.

14:49.542 --> 14:52.542
Aw, Dougie, you're not dumb.
You're a paralegal?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.208
Well, I ain't just a pair
of legs.

14:54.291 --> 14:55.583
What do you think
I'm doing here?

14:55.667 --> 14:56.667
Uh, I don't know.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.750
I thought you just
kind of hung out here

14:58.834 --> 14:59.959
'cause your dad's a partner

15:00.041 --> 15:01.834
and it's downhill
from your apartment.

15:01.917 --> 15:04.166
(country music playing on radio)

15:04.250 --> 15:06.583
(phone ringing)

15:06.667 --> 15:07.625
Hello.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.959
Matt, I need you
to bring me my spy cam.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.250
Oh, and I think I left
the curling iron on.

15:12.333 --> 15:16.000
Hey, don't tell anyone
this isn't natural.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.834
Yeah, uh...
I'm not at home anymore, Dougie,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.542
and I don't where
your spy cam is.

15:19.625 --> 15:22.208
Of course you do. It's the
red light on your ceiling fan.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.750
You put a spy cam in my room?

15:24.834 --> 15:26.166
Don't bitch at me.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.709
I'm not asking you to get
the one out of the bathroom.

15:28.792 --> 15:29.750
What?

15:29.834 --> 15:31.291
<i>Oh, please, Matt.</i>

15:31.375 --> 15:34.667
You've been performing for me
in there, and we both know it.

15:35.583 --> 15:36.875
(phone beeps)

15:36.959 --> 15:39.625
Your brother-in-law
is a real prude douche.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.083
You know what, Dougie?

15:41.166 --> 15:43.041
I think you're smarter
than a lot of people

15:43.125 --> 15:46.291
give you credit for, and I bet,
if you put your mind to it,

15:46.375 --> 15:48.500
you could figure out
who stole your lunch.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.834
Interesting thing is, Jen,

15:50.917 --> 15:54.125
I never said anything
about someone stealing my lunch.

15:54.208 --> 15:57.792
It was literally the first
thing you said to me.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.083
Okay, one suspect down.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.458
Unless...

16:01.542 --> 16:02.583
Don't have a twin.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.208
-(grunts)
-Yeah.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.041
Listen, I have
a lot of work to do.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.417
I would love to help you, but...

16:07.500 --> 16:09.542
-Oh, that's perfect.
-Hmm?

16:09.625 --> 16:12.166
You're like the only friend
I have around here.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.667
I... There's this one weird guy
that talks to me at lunch,

16:14.750 --> 16:16.500
but other than that, it's you.

16:16.583 --> 16:21.500
Yeah, sure, sure. Let's, uh...
let's find this thief.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.750
We're gonna do this.
We're gonna find out who it is.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.750
-Yeah.
-Then I'm gonna crush him!

16:25.834 --> 16:29.917
I'm gonna shove my fist
up his rectum

16:30.000 --> 16:30.959
and ask him,

16:31.041 --> 16:33.750
"Did you like
that turkey sandwich?"

16:33.834 --> 16:35.458
-Okay...
-"Was it worth it?"

16:35.542 --> 16:39.083
I-I-I'm with you 100%
until that graphic violence.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.291
Okay.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.667
(country music playing on radio)

16:49.208 --> 16:52.250
We have narrowed it down to the
12 lawyers who bring their lunch

16:52.333 --> 16:53.875
because they're too cheap
to go out.

16:53.959 --> 16:56.166
Okay, well,
it can't Feinberg or Mellman

16:56.250 --> 16:58.250
because they're
lactose-intolerant

16:58.333 --> 17:00.333
and my lunch on Tuesday
was a flight of ice cream.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.583
All right, that's a good start.
Who else can you eliminate?

17:02.667 --> 17:05.083
Andy. He hasn't showed up
to work in, like, a month.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.166
I've been parking in his spot.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.750
Well, maybe that letter he told
me to forward to everybody

17:09.834 --> 17:11.750
wasn't an April Fools' joke.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.291
You're saying he's dead?

17:14.458 --> 17:16.208
Okay, we'll circle back to that.

17:16.291 --> 17:19.959
Who on this list
do you think is most likely

17:20.041 --> 17:21.709
to have his hands on your lunch?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.875
Ta-da! I made it.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.208
Not that. I made it here.

17:31.291 --> 17:34.250
I mean, I did make that, too,
to be clear. Hi, I'm Matt Short.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.041
Right, in your line of work
you probably don't like

17:38.125 --> 17:40.500
to shake hands
with the customers you meet.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.000
-Dougie.
-I don't know who took it.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.834
Oh, come on, Dougie, focus.

17:44.917 --> 17:47.125
I'm doing my best,
you crabby bitch!

17:47.959 --> 17:49.959
I'm so sorry.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.792
I get really cranky
when I'm hungry.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.208
I have low blood sugar.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.250
Oh, that's good. I'm gonna start
using that excuse, too.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.959
It's true. I get it from my dad.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.917
He can be a real S.O.B.
when he gets peckish.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.750
you soulless vampire?!

18:05.834 --> 18:07.208
No, no, no, no, no. Dougie.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.625
-Listen to me. Listen to me.
-I'm gonna faint.

18:08.709 --> 18:11.417
Your dad has low blood sugar

18:11.500 --> 18:14.000
and he packs his lunch
every day.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
And he has my last name.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.625
I bet he's taking it
on accident.

18:17.709 --> 18:18.667
Mm-hmm.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.041
Or on purpose,

18:20.125 --> 18:21.917
like he did with my Christmas
presents when I was a kid.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.166
Oh, Dougie. You know what?

18:24.250 --> 18:26.250
You are just as smart
as any lawyer here.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.000
And you work super slowly,

18:28.083 --> 18:30.625
which is how we bill
so many hours.

18:30.709 --> 18:31.792
Aw.

18:31.875 --> 18:36.291
Jen, I... I would hug you,
but once I hit that gas,

18:36.375 --> 18:37.875
I don't know how
to put the brakes on.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.083
Oh, well, Dougie, where we're
going, we don't need brakes.

18:40.166 --> 18:42.000
-Ooh.
-No. No, I just mean,

18:42.083 --> 18:43.458
'cause we're just gonna do,
like, a back pat.

18:43.542 --> 18:45.542
That feels nice. Well, you know,
I'm gonna take my chances.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.250
-Ah, take your chances.
-Oh, oh.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.959
-Oh, my God! My booby trap!
-Booby trap?

18:50.041 --> 18:52.375
I got to get to my lunch bag
before my dad does.

18:52.458 --> 18:53.500
What?

18:56.041 --> 18:57.875
Dad, stop!

18:57.959 --> 18:58.917
Huh?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.250
Oh, thank goodness.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.667
It didn't go off.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.291
What didn't go off?

19:05.375 --> 19:07.583
-Nothing. Enjoy your lunch, Dad.
-Yeah.

19:07.667 --> 19:08.625
Huh.

19:08.709 --> 19:11.709
Love your tie.
Always love your ties.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.583
Huh?

19:15.667 --> 19:17.125
Did you write your name
on your specimen?

19:17.208 --> 19:20.083
Ah, good call. I did not.
Can I borrow a pen, please?

19:23.542 --> 19:26.125
Congratulations, it's a boy.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.709
(coughs)

19:32.291 --> 19:34.083
We have to remember this.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.875
Every day is full
of different moments

19:35.959 --> 19:37.542
that can change your destiny.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.875
You know I'm just masturbating
into a cup, right?

19:39.959 --> 19:41.291
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

19:41.375 --> 19:42.458
Are you sure you don't
want to do it at home?

19:42.542 --> 19:43.750
You know,
I thought about it,

19:43.834 --> 19:45.625
a lot can happen
in 30 minutes. Why risk it?

19:45.709 --> 19:47.417
Oh, thank you so much, sweetie.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.458
-(laughs)
-Yeah.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.667
I am so excited
that we're doing this.

19:50.750 --> 19:51.709
Mr. Short.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.500
Go get 'em.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.000
Okay.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.625
(chuckles)

19:59.709 --> 20:02.709
We've got a room for you
right here, Mr. Short.

20:02.792 --> 20:04.250
You can take
all the time you need.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.625
MAN:
Someone's in here.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.750
Do you want to wait
or go to a different room?

20:09.834 --> 20:11.625
I want you to close the door.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.500
Thank you.

20:14.583 --> 20:16.375
So we wait.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.542
