who the hell is abducting
these young women.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.041
Yeah, Tiff and Scola
are with the M.E. now.

10:51.128 --> 10:52.303
Let's get an update
as soon as possible.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.436
Let's go, people!
We're chasing a killer here.

10:56.307 --> 10:59.223
Blunt force trauma.
Death was instantaneous.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.486
But sepsis would've killed her
within 36 hours

11:01.573 --> 11:02.531
if not for the accident.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.141
Sepsis? How'd she get that?

11:04.228 --> 11:05.665
The metal restraints
on her ankles.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.579
She was shackled
for a long time.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.059
Any signs of sexual abuse?

11:09.146 --> 11:11.366
Vaginal bruising
is consistent with that.

11:11.453 --> 11:13.542
I also found multiple stun gun
marks on her torso

11:13.629 --> 11:15.283
and dorsal regions.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.938
This girl, she had it rough.

11:20.723 --> 11:21.985
- Thanks, Neil.
- Mm-hmm.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.690
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Drabeck.

11:30.777 --> 11:34.955
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I just have a few questions.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.479
My daughter disappeared
four months ago.

11:39.046 --> 11:41.744
Where was the FBI
with its questions then?

11:44.747 --> 11:45.792
I understand how you feel.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.054
The reason I brought you in

11:47.141 --> 11:50.318
is because a second girl
has been taken,

11:50.405 --> 11:53.147
and we think these abductions
might be connected.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.628
So you could help us catch
this monster right now.

11:58.543 --> 12:01.459
If you could just take a look
at this list of locations

12:01.546 --> 12:04.811
the second girl visited
the day she was abducted.

12:04.898 --> 12:08.684
Maybe there was some kind
of overlap with Cassidy.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.951
I don't recognize
any of these.

12:17.475 --> 12:18.912

12:26.397 --> 12:28.573
She went to a rehearsal
at the Round Bridge,

12:28.660 --> 12:31.751
this community theater
in Astoria.

12:31.838 --> 12:35.276
She called telling me
she was on her way home.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.930
I never saw her again.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.847
And the police looked
into this?

12:42.587 --> 12:44.024
For a minute.

12:45.895 --> 12:49.290
"No evidence of foul play,"
they said.

12:49.377 --> 12:51.814
Made it out like Cassie
just ran off.

12:54.599 --> 12:58.560

Her name's Angela Mullins.

No.

13:54.007 --> 13:56.009

13:56.096 --> 13:58.054
I make 10 bucks an hour
to oversee the space,

13:58.141 --> 14:00.143

Angela was handing out flyers

14:18.335 --> 14:20.294

a few weeks back.

14:20.381 --> 14:23.210
Yeah, okay, so Cassidy
was performing at the theater,

14:23.297 --> 14:24.167
Angela was handing out
fliers there.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.560
It's not much,
but it's something.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.822

14:37.485 --> 14:39.574
I dug up the files
on Cassidy Drabeck.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.010
We did a bit of legwork

14:41.097 --> 14:42.533
before closing
the missing persons case.

14:42.620 --> 14:46.189
She called 911 two nights
before she disappeared.

14:46.276 --> 14:49.497
Says a gold car followed
her home from the grocery.

14:49.584 --> 14:52.239
At the time, it was too vague
to justify follow-up.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.197
Well, it's specific enough
for another conversation

14:54.284 --> 14:56.025
with Cassidy's dad.
Thanks.

14:59.115 --> 15:02.379
No, Cassie never told me

15:02.466 --> 15:04.251
about any gold car
that was following her.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.166
Well, she never said
she was being stalked or--

15:06.253 --> 15:08.385
No.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.870

for the guy.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.657
She probably didn't
wanna worry me.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.617

He emailed me these crazed
love letters, followed me.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.188
I got a restraining order,
and that was it.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.494
I never saw him again.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.240

Darcy Edmonds
is Doyle Buckler's Girl Zero.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.860
She broke his heart,
and he's trying to mend it

23:03.947 --> 23:05.384

that look like her.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.348
what the BAU calls
"intimacy-building."

23:13.435 --> 23:16.482
But he needed access
to get personal information.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.049
And to get it,
he might've left a trail.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.095

Now, Doyle impersonated her
with what, Julie Clark,

23:29.277 --> 23:31.148
