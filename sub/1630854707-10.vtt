16:12.880 --> 16:13.990
Just fuckin' meet me at Mom's.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.450
Come in quiet.
Okay?

16:15.650 --> 16:16.920
I'm headed there now.
Okay?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.290
Fuck, I'm on my way.

16:18.490 --> 16:24.380
[music]

16:49.570 --> 16:50.870
[Mike] <i>Jesus.</i>

16:52.770 --> 16:58.910
[music]

17:20.870 --> 17:22.340
It'll be okay.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.220
No, it won't.

17:25.420 --> 17:31.310
[music]

17:50.300 --> 17:51.620
[Ian] Mike, what the fuck?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.220
[Kyle] I figured we needed
numbers.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.400
Yeah, okay.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.220
Milo's in the fuckin' house?

17:56.420 --> 17:57.420
Yeah.

17:57.620 --> 17:59.090
If they fuckin' laid a finger
on your mother...

17:59.290 --> 18:00.510
All right, look,
we're gonna do--

18:01.040 --> 18:02.040
Fucking...

18:02.410 --> 18:04.310
[Ian] Mikey, what is it?
What is it?

18:04.810 --> 18:06.150
Fuck!

18:08.680 --> 18:10.150
I don't have the fuckin' bonds.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.720
What?

18:12.690 --> 18:13.610
Jesus.

18:13.810 --> 18:15.140
They're in the fucking Lincoln.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.710
What the fuck are we gonna do?

18:16.910 --> 18:23.000
[music]

18:28.740 --> 18:30.270
[knocking on door]

18:32.010 --> 18:34.280
[Mike] I'm here.
No weapon.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.020
Your hands are empty.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.990
You broke into my fuckin' house,
Milo.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.030
You took my mother hostage.

18:51.560 --> 18:53.730
I'm just here to make sure
everything is...

18:57.570 --> 18:58.600
as it should be.

18:59.330 --> 19:00.300
Right?

19:03.810 --> 19:06.610
Your mother is telling you that
my men are in the kitchen too.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.680
She's trying to tell you that
you have no play.

19:12.010 --> 19:13.600
It's all gonna be over soon, Ma.

19:13.800 --> 19:15.520
- Okay?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.620
- Whose blood is that?
- [Milo] Joseph's.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.320
She killed him.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.840
It's okay.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.160
Tati cleaned it up,
she's very tidy.

19:27.090 --> 19:29.110
Did you ever hear of
the Peter Principle, Mike?

19:29.310 --> 19:31.220
I didn't pay attention in
school, Milo.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.120
You get more and more
responsibilities

19:34.320 --> 19:36.520
because you're really good at
the thing that you do.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.990
But eventually you get to
a place where you're in

19:39.190 --> 19:42.490
a position in which you were
above your abilities.

19:42.690 --> 19:44.480
And that was our Joseph.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.750
Is that you, too, Mike?

19:47.080 --> 19:48.930
I'm here to make sure my mom...

19:49.130 --> 19:50.290
and Iris are whole.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.170
That's it.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.600
Well, now you see.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.760
Yeah.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.790
[Milo] I don't wanna shoot
your mother.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.630
But I will.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.460
Where are my bonds?

20:02.800 --> 20:03.770
They're in a car.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.670
Outside.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.740
You disappoint me, Mike.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.860
Mitch would never leave me
waiting.

20:11.060 --> 20:12.170
Yeah.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.180
A cop was...

20:15.940 --> 20:18.400
Hospitalized, I got ambushed.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.500
Really?

20:19.700 --> 20:21.070
A lot of hurdles I had
to get through.

20:21.270 --> 20:22.270
But I'm here.

20:22.470 --> 20:24.270
So, Iris just happens
to kill Joseph

20:24.470 --> 20:26.620
the same night
of all of your hurdles?

20:27.360 --> 20:30.120
She just happened to turn up
at the house?

20:31.160 --> 20:32.960
Do you think I'm fucking stupid,
Mike?

20:33.460 --> 20:35.350
She's your girl, she does
what she wants.

20:35.550 --> 20:41.440
[music]

20:42.070 --> 20:44.820
[grunting]

20:45.020 --> 20:46.060
[Milo] Come on.

20:46.260 --> 20:52.350
[music]

21:04.760 --> 21:06.360
You fucked up, Mike.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.740
[Milo] Go, go, go, go, go!

21:24.080 --> 21:25.200
[Mike] Mom, come on.
Behind me.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.830
- I'm with you.
- Come over here, over here.

21:28.030 --> 21:33.920

22:27.110 --> 22:28.380
Now.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.250
How many?

22:31.680 --> 22:32.430
One bad guy.

22:32.630 --> 22:34.320
- Where's Ian?
- I don't know.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.660
- Yeah.
- Get up!

22:58.210 --> 22:59.710
[Kyle] Down!

23:02.410 --> 23:04.200
Oh my God, oh shit.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.560
Oh shit, Mom!

23:05.760 --> 23:07.130
- Ma, you okay?
- [Kyle] Mom.

23:07.330 --> 23:08.480
- Mom, mom, fuck.
- [Mike] Jesus.

23:09.850 --> 23:12.340
Oh, fuck.
No, fuck!

23:12.540 --> 23:13.840
Hey, help me with her!
Would you?

23:14.040 --> 23:14.910
All right?
Ian!

23:15.110 --> 23:16.410
Fuck, fuck!

23:16.610 --> 23:17.440
Ian!

23:17.640 --> 23:18.940
[Kyle] I fuckin' shot her,
Mike...

23:19.140 --> 23:20.880
Hey, listen to me, we gotta
get her to the fuckin' hospital!

23:21.080 --> 23:21.780
Let's go!

23:21.980 --> 23:28.020
[music]

23:28.220 --> 23:32.340
[siren wailing]

23:38.850 --> 23:44.070
[vague, echoy voices]

23:44.270 --> 23:50.360
[music]

24:10.880 --> 24:17.020
[music]

24:26.530 --> 24:27.550
<i>Hey.</i>

24:27.750 --> 24:28.780
They're preppin' the OR.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.620
All right?
The bullet's near the spine.

24:30.820 --> 24:34.290
Didn't puncture the lung
or the heart, they don't think.

24:34.490 --> 24:35.250
Is she awake?

24:35.450 --> 24:36.150
[Ian] No.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.660
[Mike] How long until she's in?

24:37.860 --> 24:38.860
[Ian] ASAP.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.490
And how long is surgery?

24:40.690 --> 24:42.330
[Ian] An hour, maybe two hour,
I mean, they gotta figure out

24:42.530 --> 24:43.800
what to do with the blood,
but she's strong.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Mariam's a tough cookie, Mike.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.730
She's gonna pull through this.

24:46.930 --> 24:47.870
[Kyle] I shot her, Mike.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.280
I put that fuckin' bullet in
her.

24:50.850 --> 24:52.090
Hey.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.220
You were tryin' to fuckin'
save her, okay?

24:56.990 --> 24:59.060
Tryin' to protect our family.
It's just...

24:59.590 --> 25:01.200
a fucking awful accident.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.780
That's all it is.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.400
You shot her with an AB gun,
remember?

25:05.930 --> 25:07.790
They're gonna pull this bullet
out of her...

25:07.990 --> 25:09.540
Mom's gonna be fine.

25:10.140 --> 25:11.740
And none of this goes near you.

25:12.010 --> 25:12.960
Okay?

25:13.160 --> 25:14.540
No one needs to know about this.

25:15.340 --> 25:17.410
She was shot by one of Milo's
goons.

25:18.710 --> 25:19.860
We clear on this?

25:20.060 --> 25:21.270
100% fuckin' clear.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.640
I'm not gonna lie, Mike.
I'm not gonna fuckin' lie.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.390
The fuck you're not.

25:26.850 --> 25:28.460
The fuck you're not, Kyle.

25:31.460 --> 25:34.360
We weren't blessed with easy.
You know that.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.700
We just do our best
to stand tall.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.950
And come in tomorrow, even with
the tiniest bit of hope...

25:42.150 --> 25:43.740
it'll be better than today.

25:44.340 --> 25:47.510
You have a child coming.
You have a life.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.430
So, you can't go waving this
around like a badge,

25:50.630 --> 25:51.730
'cause it will define you.

25:51.930 --> 25:54.670
And you are not just
this moment.

25:54.870 --> 25:56.220
You're a good man.

25:56.650 --> 25:57.820
You're my brother.

25:58.350 --> 26:00.070
And you made a mistake.
You won't own it,

26:00.270 --> 26:02.620
you won't eat it,
for your child.

26:03.790 --> 26:05.160
For your wife.

26:10.430 --> 26:12.400
Mom's gonna come out of this.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.320
And when she does,

26:16.520 --> 26:19.890
you're gonna be grounded, like,
fuckin' forever, you know?

26:20.090 --> 26:21.530
[Kyle] Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you.

26:21.730 --> 26:23.140
You're so fucked.

26:23.580 --> 26:24.430
Fuck off...

26:24.630 --> 26:26.310
[Mike] She's gonna fuckin'
kill you.

26:29.050 --> 26:30.840
All right, so come on.
I need you.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.190
All right?

26:32.690 --> 26:34.260
My man.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.370
Where are you goin'?

26:36.570 --> 26:38.440
I'm gonna put a period
on this fuckin' thing.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.310
Mike, please, just sit with me,
will you?

26:40.510 --> 26:42.310
No, I brought this to
our family,

26:42.510 --> 26:44.230
and I brought it into
our fuckin' home.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.500
So, let me finish this thing.

26:47.740 --> 26:48.850
I got him.

26:49.050 --> 26:55.580
[music]

27:00.110 --> 27:03.150
[vehicle beeping]
[indistinct chatter]

27:09.720 --> 27:10.730
[Ian] Mike!

27:11.530 --> 27:13.590
Let me get an escaped prisoner
alert out there.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.600
He's gonna make a break for
the fuckin' border.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.620
He still thinks I have
the bonds.

27:18.820 --> 27:19.720
I know, I know.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.050
So, I want this fucker.

27:21.250 --> 27:22.820
Mikey, I can checkpoint
every backroad,

27:23.020 --> 27:24.220
every highway,
every eye in the sky,

27:24.420 --> 27:25.760
I'll get the marine unit on it.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.290
Do all that, that's fine.

27:27.490 --> 27:29.690
But you hear anything, though,
anything, you let me know first.

27:29.890 --> 27:31.050
All right?

27:31.780 --> 27:32.800
[Ian] What about Kyle?

27:33.000 --> 27:33.880
Fuck.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.470
I don't know.

27:35.670 --> 27:37.820
I don't know about anything
right now, Ian.

27:38.050 --> 27:39.100
Okay?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.500
We're just gonna make it up
as we go.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.970
First things first,
we get fuckin' Milo.

27:43.170 --> 27:44.840
- I'm with you.
- [Mike] All right.

27:45.040 --> 27:51.130
[music]

28:13.350 --> 28:19.430
[pulsating electronic music]

28:52.560 --> 28:53.310
Where is he?

28:53.510 --> 28:55.110
You don't mean, where is she?

28:55.310 --> 28:56.450
Where's Milo?

28:56.650 --> 28:58.520
I don't know.
You destroyed his plan, so...

28:58.720 --> 29:00.820
he's, I'm sure,
making a new one.

29:01.020 --> 29:01.850
Wanna call him?

29:02.050 --> 29:03.220
It's kinda late.

29:03.420 --> 29:04.690
Jesus Christ, call
this fucking cocksucker.

29:04.890 --> 29:06.060
[Mike] Listen to me.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.420
Just get him on
the fuckin' phone.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.460
Okay?

29:08.660 --> 29:09.830
Then we'll keep you off
our radar.

29:10.030 --> 29:11.430
Or keep dickin' around,

29:11.630 --> 29:15.300
and I'll ensure that the cops
and the gangs roll through here

29:15.500 --> 29:17.000
on fuckin' rotation,

29:17.200 --> 29:19.040
where you can't fuckin' piss

29:19.240 --> 29:21.270
without a raid or
a fucking shootout.

29:21.470 --> 29:24.080
Is that the environment you
wanna run these girls through?

29:24.280 --> 29:26.210
You should've just given him
his money.

29:26.410 --> 29:29.160
He's a fugitive,
he just wants to run away.

29:29.630 --> 29:31.570
You're not the only one
after him.

29:32.930 --> 29:33.940
Call him.

[Milo] <i>That was not very smart,</i>
<i>Mike.</i>

30:02.950 --> 30:05.400
Where do we meet, Milo?

30:07.730 --> 30:08.840
You bring yours...

30:09.770 --> 30:10.970
I'll bring mine.

30:11.970 --> 30:13.610
[Milo] <i>Last chance, Mike.</i>

30:14.040 --> 30:16.180
One hour, the East 26th Harbor.

30:16.740 --> 30:19.080
Bring any of your friends,
they will die.

30:19.550 --> 30:21.680
But your girl will die first.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.420
One hour.

30:26.920 --> 30:32.790
[music]

30:33.790 --> 30:35.230
If I don't kill him...

30:38.100 --> 30:39.500
He's comin' after you.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.290
I know.

30:42.490 --> 30:44.710
You should take that baby
and get the fuck out of here.

30:46.070 --> 30:47.020
Where?

30:47.220 --> 30:48.440
Anywhere but here.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.880
I have friends, Mr. McLusky.

30:53.510 --> 30:55.100
I can take care of myself.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.920
You should do the same.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.650
Yeah.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.770
Call your friends, tell 'em
we're fuckin' comin'.

31:01.970 --> 31:02.940
Let's go.

Hey.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.580
[Tracy] <i>I got your message.</i>

31:27.450 --> 31:29.520
I am so sorry, Kyle.

31:30.880 --> 31:32.650
[Kyle] Baby, I didn't wanna
wake you.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.740
[Tracy] <i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

31:34.940 --> 31:36.540
[Kyle] I miss you so much.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.090
I miss you, too.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.160
How's Mom doing?

31:41.500 --> 31:43.130
She's...

31:45.000 --> 31:47.370
You know, she's tough.
She's strong.

31:50.170 --> 31:52.240
You know, she can't die, Trace.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.010
[Tracy] <i>I'm gonna come back</i>
<i>tomorrow morning.</i>

31:55.380 --> 31:56.480
<i>Kyle...</i>

31:56.910 --> 31:58.610
I love you, okay?

32:00.180 --> 32:01.800
<i>Give Mariam a kiss for me</i>

32:02.000 --> 32:04.090
and tell her I love her
very much.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.320
Okay.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.120
I will.

32:10.290 --> 32:11.390
I love you.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.440

[Carney] <i>What's goin' on?</i>

32:33.030 --> 32:34.830
It happens tonight.
You understand me?

32:35.030 --> 32:36.320
Who you got on?

32:37.580 --> 32:39.120
Same pieces of shit.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.320
How they doin' without Davidson?

32:42.790 --> 32:45.840
Someone'll rise, fill the void.
You know how it works, Mike.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.310
[Mike] <i>Well, there's about to be</i>
<i>another void.</i>

32:47.510 --> 32:48.310
<i>You understand me?</i>

32:48.510 --> 32:49.600
I want it to fuckin' happen
tonight.

32:50.230 --> 32:53.080

Fellas, thanks for waitin'.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.310
Hey.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.510
Hey, Patty.

34:41.810 --> 34:43.280
I heard about your mother.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.110
Yeah.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.510
How's she doin'?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.550
She's...

34:54.120 --> 34:55.460
I don't know.

34:58.020 --> 34:59.530
Any change here?

35:00.130 --> 35:01.360
Stable.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.670
First time anyone's ever
called him that.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.670
I'm gonna go check the machines.

35:12.470 --> 35:15.440
See if they've got some mints
or gum.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.150
Maybe a Charleston Chew
or somethin'.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.080
Will you sit with him
until I get back?

35:21.650 --> 35:22.720
Yeah, sure.

35:25.150 --> 35:26.000
Thanks, pal.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.490
[Kyle] Yeah.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.230
Hey, man.

35:39.030 --> 35:40.270
How you doin' in there?

35:41.740 --> 35:42.800
Huh?

35:47.040 --> 35:48.440
Must be quiet.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
Quiet'd be nice right now.

35:59.850 --> 36:01.490
None of this bullshit...

36:02.720 --> 36:04.260
None of this noise.

36:05.590 --> 36:08.110
Not havin' to think about
anything.

36:08.310 --> 36:11.100
You know, or how things were,
or...

36:12.470 --> 36:14.300
...might've been, or...

36:15.040 --> 36:16.540
...could be.

36:20.070 --> 36:22.240
Yeah, that must be nice.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.620
My mom's down the hall.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.220
And I put her there.

36:40.960 --> 36:42.360
It's just...

36:44.270 --> 36:46.330
It fuckin' sucks out here.

36:47.670 --> 36:53.610
[music]

37:27.510 --> 37:29.160
It's time to flip the script.

All blacks, man.

37:31.160 --> 37:37.250
[music]

37:45.330 --> 37:46.960
[Milo] Watch your step.

37:50.330 --> 37:51.900
You can wait on board.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.770
Don't like boats?

38:02.140 --> 38:03.440
I don't like you.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.720
Why do you think he's willing
to fight so hard for you?

38:13.650 --> 38:14.760
I don't know.

38:15.220 --> 38:16.690
You're that good a fuck?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.630
I never slept with him.

38:20.060 --> 38:22.250
So why, then?

38:22.450 --> 38:24.370
Maybe I'm somethin' to do.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.000
Before...

38:28.540 --> 38:30.570
...or after he kills you.

38:31.270 --> 38:35.280
God exists in the least
of things, Iris.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.950
And I think, maybe...

38:40.080 --> 38:42.480
Mike sees God in you.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.620
I think he sees his own
salvation in saving you.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.890
Makes me wanna end you.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.980
End his inevitable suffering

38:56.180 --> 38:58.480
when he realizes
what you really are.

38:58.680 --> 39:03.400
[music]

39:31.500 --> 39:34.280
Mike, do you think that fucker's
just gonna take those bonds

39:34.490 --> 39:35.550
and let you walk away?

39:35.750 --> 39:37.870
Let me get some backup
and some S.W.A.T. down here.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.030
If he feels anything,
he'll just kill her.

39:42.230 --> 39:44.550
Mikey, I don't wanna be
an asshole, but fuck it.

39:45.180 --> 39:47.560
I don't know this girl,
why not let him take her?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.030
Let 'em both go.

39:49.230 --> 39:51.150
'Cause it's the right thing to
do, Ian, that's why.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.560
All right, what do you
want me to do?

39:57.860 --> 39:59.280
[Mike] You have any long johns
in the trunk?

39:59.480 --> 40:00.310
Yup.

40:00.510 --> 40:01.650
I got a fuckin' arsenal in
the back,

40:01.850 --> 40:03.000
what do you want?

40:03.430 --> 40:05.930
Why don't you just go down
the hill here,

40:06.430 --> 40:08.670
post up there, and follow me
through your scope.

40:09.570 --> 40:12.120
If anything goes sideways,
start hunting.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.560
And don't fucking shoot me.

40:53.310 --> 40:54.410
CO!

40:54.920 --> 40:56.980
- CO!
- Shut the fuck up.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.650
A message from
the mayor, motherfucker.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.670
And he gon' get that shit
today.

Oh, God!

41:07.590 --> 41:13.530

42:09.390 --> 42:10.660
Turn around.

42:36.580 --> 42:38.320
This is better, right?

42:39.450 --> 42:40.590
No drama...

42:41.490 --> 42:43.020
No shoot-'em-up.

42:43.620 --> 42:49.560

42:54.300 --> 42:55.540
There are your bonds.

43:09.780 --> 43:11.050
[Milo] There's your girl.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.760
See how easy it could've been?

43:18.260 --> 43:22.360
Think about what you're going to
do yet with your prize?

43:24.030 --> 43:25.430
Ready to go?

43:26.600 --> 43:29.270
[Milo] This fight you're
fighting, you can't win.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.160
Thinkin' you can stop
the bad thing from happening,

43:32.360 --> 43:33.440
that's ego, Mike...

43:34.810 --> 43:36.740
The bad is comin' for all of us.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.510
We're just things on
the devil's to-do list.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.800
Keep the guns on them
'til I'm gone.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.650
After that, do what you want.

43:46.150 --> 43:50.860

43:57.530 --> 43:58.650
Stop.

43:58.850 --> 43:59.770

Maybe I will kill you now.
