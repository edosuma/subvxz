- Ask him.
- Shh.

01:57.868 --> 02:00.411
- Ask him!
- Shh.

02:02.539 --> 02:06.292
Look at him, Grandpa!
Ask him!

02:06.376 --> 02:09.002
Ryan, that's enough.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.590
Um, I'm sorry.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.259
He, uh—
He thinks you're Santa Claus.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.853
I am.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.317
- Merry Christmas.
- Uh, merry Christmas.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.029
Nuts. I should have
got his autograph.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.256
What is the problem?

03:35.340 --> 03:39.302
Your Santa Claus is wearing
a topcoat and a fedora.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.931
Hyah!

03:44.016 --> 03:47.101
That's not my Santa Claus.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.313
Right. Now,

03:50.397 --> 03:53.316
throw it out and bring it up
right up high...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.443
and down she comes!

03:55.569 --> 03:57.445
Hmph.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.740
Just in the wrist, you see.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.327
It's really quite simple, you know,
when you get the knack of it.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.329
Now then, why don't you-

04:10.417 --> 04:12.752
Okay, pops, come on.
It's my turn.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.254
- Now, uh, give me the whip.
- What have you just been drinking?

04:15.339 --> 04:17.214
I just had a little
something to keep me warm.
Now, give me the whip.

04:17.341 --> 04:20.259
- You are intoxicated, sir!
- Yeah, and you are a pain in the butt.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.887
- Now, give me that whip.
- Let me tell you something.
You are a disgrace!

04:23.013 --> 04:26.349
Do you have any idea how many
children are watching you at this
very minute, and you're drinking?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.310
- Just give me back the whip.
- Let me tell you something, young man.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.104
When you put on this suit,
you represent something...

04:32.189 --> 04:36.025
that has a great meaning and significance
to millions of people all over the world!

04:38.070 --> 04:40.821
Now, I could overlook...

04:40.906 --> 04:43.240
your poorly manufactured jacket,

04:43.325 --> 04:46.661
or even your ludicrously
unbelievable beard,

04:46.745 --> 04:49.914
or perhaps your phonily padded tummy,

04:49.998 --> 04:53.709
but I will not tolerate
public drunkenness.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.337
You should be ashamed of yourself.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.840
- Hey, can I get a cop over here?
- That's a very good idea!

04:59.967 --> 05:03.386
- Officer!
- Hey, wait a minute, you.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.805
Mrs. Walker!
Mrs. Walker!

05:05.889 --> 05:09.976
Mrs. Walker!
We need your help here!

05:10.060 --> 05:12.478
Ah, ah, ah.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.439
If you’re not with the parade, sir,
you have to get back up on the sidewalk.

05:15.524 --> 05:17.441
I need to see whomever's in charge...

05:17.526 --> 05:19.735
in order to alert them to
this man's drunken condition.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.613
- Kiss my-
- Don't! Easy!

05:22.698 --> 05:25.324
Take it easy!
Gramps, come on.
Hey, come on.

05:25.409 --> 05:27.743
Let's go for a little walk, huh?

05:29.246 --> 05:31.539
Hmm.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.251
That man's a degenerate!

05:36.712 --> 05:40.006
It's time to go to work
up in the old office.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.303
Little drafty there.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.723
Hey, uh, let’s just
watch the parade, okay?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.017
Come on.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.478
Okay, now, settle in here.
Whoop!

05:57.357 --> 06:00.276
- Oh, my God.
- If this darn costume fit-

06:01.987 --> 06:06.198
Okay, we'll show this guy
how to do it.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.242
Whoa!

06:23.425 --> 06:26.844
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.739
Sir?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.616
Sir, excuse me.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.410
- Hello. I'm Dorey Walker.
- Oh.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.789
Director of Special Projects
for C.F. Cole's department store.

06:54.873 --> 06:58.334
It's my pleasure. As a matter of fact,
I was looking for you a few moments ago.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.588
There's no doubt you saw
your Santa Claus is inebriated.

07:02.672 --> 07:06.550
I know. He has created
such a terrible problem.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.970
Millions of children are watching
here and on television,

07:10.055 --> 07:13.432
and they're expecting to see Santa Claus,
and right now we don't have one.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.684
That is a terrible problem.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.062
Would you do it?

07:18.146 --> 07:20.856
Would you be our Santa Claus?

07:22.567 --> 07:26.987
- Me?
- Well, do you have any experience?

07:27.114 --> 07:30.074
- Well, just a little.
- Great. I'm sure you'll be fine.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.952
- Isn't there someone else you could ask?
- Sir, the parade...

07:33.036 --> 07:34.954
has started already.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.165
It's you, right now,
or else there is no Santa...

07:38.250 --> 07:41.335
in the Cole's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

07:45.507 --> 07:48.509
Might I perhaps have a
moment to think about it?

07:48.593 --> 07:52.555
Don't worry about a thing.
Just... be yourself.

08:08.947 --> 08:13.284
Now Dasher, now Dancer,
now Prancer and Vixen!

08:13.368 --> 08:17.746
Now Comet, now Cupid,
now Donner and Blitzen!

08:17.873 --> 08:20.916
Hey!

08:26.882 --> 08:29.800
[Man on TV] Merry Christmas!

08:29.926 --> 08:33.596
- Merry Christmas!
- This Santa Claus is fantastic.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.392
- Did he sign a contract?
- No. There wasn't any time.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.686
Myrna's gonna have him
sign after the parade.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.648
She'll have him fill out
his employment papers, and he'll
start work in the morning.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.277
The only condition he insisted on is that
he be able to wear his own Santa suit.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.279
He has his own Santa suit?

08:50.363 --> 08:53.240
Apparently.

08:53.325 --> 08:56.118
Well, if it's horrible,
we'll make him wear one of ours.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.606
I'm going home.

08:58.907 --> 09:00.607
You're not gonna watch
the rest of the parade?

09:00.790 --> 09:04.668
No, I think I've had
quite enough for one day, thank you.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.379
- I will see you in the morning.
- Okay.

09:07.464 --> 09:09.423
Chin-chin.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.344
Merry Christmas!

09:18.725 --> 09:20.809
Susan?

09:40.997 --> 09:46.710
Mom, I'm still at Mr. Bedford's.
We can see the parade from his window.

09:46.795 --> 09:50.297
So put on something comfortable
and come on over.

09:50.382 --> 09:54.343
P.S. Mr. Bedford put
the turkey in the oven.

09:54.427 --> 09:58.514
He said you forgot to sew up the
turkey's bottom. The stuffing'll fall out.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.517
But he told me
not to say anything because...

10:01.601 --> 10:05.187
he loves you,
and he wants to kiss you,

10:05.272 --> 10:09.858
and he thinks you're the most
beautiful woman in the whole world!

10:17.158 --> 10:19.278
Do you know how much it costs
to make this parade?

10:19.579 --> 10:21.079
Uh--

10:21.663 --> 10:23.580
a million dollars.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.458
- Two million dollars?
- One point six,

10:26.543 --> 10:30.337
and it's probably a big mistake,
because some guy's gonna buy Cole's...

10:30.422 --> 10:32.381
and turn it into a junk store.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.717
That's not gonna happen.
Two big banks just came in...

10:34.801 --> 10:37.845
and they rescued Cole's,
so you better check your sources.

10:37.929 --> 10:41.432
But Cole's has to
pay them back plus interest.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.684
If they don't sell
a lot of stuff at Christmas,

10:43.768 --> 10:46.020
you can forget about it, pal.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.814
Oh. Well, I think
you should ask Santa Claus...

10:48.898 --> 10:51.483
to give Cole's an interest-free loan
for Christmas.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.569
What do you think about that?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.822
- That's a good one.
- You know what? It might happen.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.826
I mean, Santa Claus, he does
some pretty amazing things.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.204
Bryan, you know what?

11:04.289 --> 11:06.165
I know.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.250
- You know what?
- The secret.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.879
- What secret?
- Santa Claus.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.591
I've known for a long time.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.180
He's not real.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.979
- Says who?
- My mom.

11:41.242 --> 11:45.371
Hi. I believe you have
something of mine.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.373
About four-foot tall,
brown hair,

11:47.457 --> 11:49.792
talks like she's 64 years old?

11:51.127 --> 11:54.004
Hey. Hi!

11:54.089 --> 11:55.881
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:59.969 --> 12:02.388
So, what do you think?

12:02.472 --> 12:04.431
- It's a good one.
- Yeah?

12:04.516 --> 12:06.809
- Did Santa Claus come by yet?
- Nope.

12:06.893 --> 12:09.853
Is it Tony Falacchi again?

12:09.979 --> 12:13.399
- No, Tony had to leave.
- Bombed?

12:13.525 --> 12:16.527
- Yes.
- It's the pressure.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.737
[Dorey] But you know what?
I got this new guy,

12:18.822 --> 12:22.408
and he really looks
like the real thing.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.577
Maybe he is.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.875
Are you still coming to dinner?

12:32.001 --> 12:34.711
- Am I still invited?
- Yes.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.732
Then I'm coming.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.533
Honey, would you run home
and put the camera stuff away?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.285
I'll put the stuff away.
You keep watching.

12:40.786 --> 12:41.386
Okay.

12:41.970 --> 12:44.763
Let her finish watching the parade.
Come on.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.182
Santa hasn't even come by yet.

12:47.267 --> 12:52.771
Well, as soon as Santa does
come by, I would like for you
to come home, all right?

12:52.856 --> 12:56.984
Sure. That's the end
of the parade anyway.

12:57.068 --> 13:00.154
There's nothing else to see
except guys cleaning up horse poop.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.698
And that doesn't thrill me at all.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.581
Hello!
Merry Christmas!

13:32.395 --> 13:34.980
[Man on phone]
Hello?

13:35.064 --> 13:36.565
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.902
I've been watching the parade.

13:39.986 --> 13:43.155
It looks bigger than last year.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.532
- What is the crowd estimate?
- Well, sir,

13:45.617 --> 13:47.576
cops say over a million.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.120
Last year it was about 750.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.372
Have marketing come up with a giveaway,

13:52.457 --> 13:54.541
something free.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.336
I don't want a crowd outside
Cole's in the morning.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.630
I hate to say this,
Mr. Landbergh,

13:59.714 --> 14:03.717
but Cole's has got one hell
of a Santa Claus this year.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.261
If I didn't know better,
I'd say he was the real article.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.641
Keep an eye on this,
Mr. Duff.

14:10.725 --> 14:15.646
These small, seemingly insignificant
sentimental anachronisms...

14:15.730 --> 14:18.440
can be surprisingly potent.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.613
I don't want my plans damaged
by an elderly cherub in a red suit.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.949
I'm on it, sir.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.080
Bye-bye!

14:43.466 --> 14:46.635
There we go.
[Dorey, Susan] Ooh! Aah!

14:46.719 --> 14:49.012
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.306
Happy Thanksgiving.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.561
You know, this is kind of like TV.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.938
Except I'd need a brother and a dog.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.232
And Bryan would be the dad.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.527
- Mr. Bedford.
- He said I could call him Bryan.

15:03.611 --> 15:08.240
- Only if it's okay with your mom.
- It's fine.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.660
Bryan would be the dad,
you'd be the mom, and we'd need...

15:11.744 --> 15:14.329
either a kind of
fat person who's our cook,

15:14.414 --> 15:16.957
or a neighbor who's always
at our house.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.293
You know,
that's not very interesting.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.462
- Why don't we talk about something else?
- For the chef.

15:22.547 --> 15:25.340
In the loosest sense of the word.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.635
In every sense of the word.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.180
The vegetables are catered.
So was dessert.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.853
- Thank you, Susan.
- You're welcome.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.815
Do we give blessings
in this house?

15:41.899 --> 15:45.235
Not unless my grandparents are here.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.280
Would you mind if I did?
It's kind of a tradition with me.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.199
Oh. Fine.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.912
We give thanks
for the food before us...

15:55.997 --> 15:59.416
and the closeness
of the people we love.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.252
We pray that these gifts
we so gratefully receive...

16:02.337 --> 16:07.382
will be shared with those less fortunate...
than ourselves.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.677
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:12.013 --> 16:14.681
All right. Let's eat.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.392
I slaved all day.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.271
They really outdid themselves.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.880
You have a very nice name.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.758
One of my elves is married
to a fellow called Daniel.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.885
- Do you know what you want for Christmas?
- Yup.

18:56.969 --> 19:01.765
I want a Peter Polliwog
Patrol Frog that swims and blows up.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.851
- Gosh, that sounds great.
- [Woman] Psst.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.771
Psst. Can Mother have a word
with Santa, please?

19:07.855 --> 19:11.191
Yes, of course.
Just a minute.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.111
Don't make me look bad.
Them things cost 70 bucks.

19:15.196 --> 19:18.573
He just looked at them.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.992
I tell you what. Shopper's Express
have got them on sale...

19:21.077 --> 19:22.994
at $34.99.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.832
With a five dollar rebate,
that's reasonable enough, isn't it?

19:26.916 --> 19:29.334
Yeah. Thanks.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.004
But let me ask you a question.
Since when is Cole's sending
customers someplace else?

19:33.089 --> 19:35.507
Oh, I don't think it matters
where the toys are sold...

19:35.591 --> 19:37.592
as long as it makes
the children happy.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.470
I'm sure the people in this store
believe exactly the same as I do.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.933
Yeah... Yeah, that's the spirit.
Thanks, Santa.

19:45.059 --> 19:49.020
- Merry Christmas to you.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

19:49.105 --> 19:52.440
Now then, young man,
if you’re a very good boy...

19:52.525 --> 19:54.526
and do exactly
what your mommy tells you,

19:54.610 --> 19:58.655
you're going to have
a Peter Polliwog for Christmas.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.535
- Bye, Santa.
- Bye-bye.

20:03.619 --> 20:06.663
Bye-bye, Daniel.
Merry Christmas.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.541
Come on, then.
Come on. Right.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.253
Up here on my-
That's it, on my knee. Now, then.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.214
You the boss?

20:16.299 --> 20:18.258
I'm general manager of the store.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.553
My kid just asked Santa
for a barf gun, and the Santa
said he'd get it for him.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.597
I hope the boy likes it.
They're over there by the elevator.

20:23.681 --> 20:27.100
And they're 90 bucks
without batteries or barf.

20:27.226 --> 20:30.645
- Prices do go up.
- Apparently not at Bargain Village.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.773
- $52.50, and they throw in the batteries.
- I find it hard to believe...

20:33.858 --> 20:35.734
Cole's could be undersold
by that much.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.819
- Yeah.
- Where'd you get your information from?

20:37.904 --> 20:40.405
From your Santa Claus.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.409
We don't have them,
but if you go out of here,

20:44.493 --> 20:46.653
turn to the right
and then two blocks down-

20:46.779 --> 20:47.673
Excuse me?

20:47.794 --> 20:49.774
Your Santa's telling
everybody where to go shop.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.584
If you don't got it
or it's too expensive here,
he's sending people...

20:52.668 --> 20:54.170
to where they can get it,
and at the right price.

20:54.371 --> 20:55.071
You're serious?

20:55.254 --> 20:56.241
Absolutely.

20:56.842 --> 20:58.942
Madam, would you excuse me
for a moment?

20:59.025 --> 21:02.001
You tell your Santa Claus that he
made a Cole's shopper out of me.

21:01.686 --> 21:04.638
I'm coming here for everything
but toilet paper and bananas.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.807
Any store that puts the parent
ahead of the almighty buck
at Christmas...

21:07.892 --> 21:11.144
deserves my business,
and you can tell Mr. Cole
that his Santa Claus...

21:11.228 --> 21:13.438
ought to get a raise.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.447
You want me to go with you
to the chairman...

21:22.531 --> 21:26.618
and pitch an idea that
you got from Santa Claus?

21:26.702 --> 21:30.622
If Cole's doesn't have
what you're looking for,

21:30.706 --> 21:34.459
we'll find it for you, even if it
means sending you somewhere else.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.022
How does that sound?

21:36.223 --> 21:39.923
It sounds like a great way
to go out of business.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.760
You know that house in the country
where we do the catalog shoot?

21:43.886 --> 21:46.137
- You wanted to buy it.
- Yes.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.682
If this works, we're probably
looking at a bonus.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.646
- And if he hates the idea?
- We're no worse off.

21:54.730 --> 21:58.233
If we don't turn this store around,
we're all out, from the chairman
to the janitor.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.572
Let's do it.

22:16.460 --> 22:19.045
I... like it.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.007
It's bold, it's fresh,

22:22.091 --> 22:26.386
it will drive
Victor Landbergh nuts.

22:31.934 --> 22:36.855
♪ It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas ♪

22:36.939 --> 22:40.442
♪ Soon the bells
will start ♪

22:40.526 --> 22:42.527
♪ And the thing that will
make them ring ♪

22:42.611 --> 22:44.654
♪ Is the carol that you sing ♪

22:44.739 --> 22:48.992
♪ Right within your heart ♪

22:49.076 --> 22:53.288
♪ It's beginning to look
a lot like Christmas ♪♪

22:54.623 --> 22:59.044
Why? Why didn't you
think of this?

23:00.671 --> 23:03.381
Now, if this campaign is successful
and I know in my gut it will be,

23:03.466 --> 23:05.717
Cole's is gonna make
a lot of money.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.386
Now, the more money they make,
the harder it is going to be...

23:08.471 --> 23:10.805
for me to buy them out.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.642
Now, I want something
done about this.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.651
When I call your name,
it'll be your turn to talk to Santa.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.987
Just a few more minutes,
and you'll get to see Santa Claus too.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.242
Okay, go ahead.

23:33.454 --> 23:36.081
This seems like a pretty
pointless exercise, Bryan.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.333
I know, but I just thought
as long as we were here,

23:38.417 --> 23:40.710
we might as well stop by
and say hello to the old guy.

23:40.836 --> 23:43.213
Look at him.
Why?

23:43.297 --> 23:46.132
Let’s just say for the sake
of argument that there is
a Santa Claus...

23:47.676 --> 23:50.095
and that you
don't believe in him.

23:50.179 --> 23:54.182
Is it worth the risk that you
might not get anything
for Christmas this year?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.601
Well, I didn't believe in him
last year, and I still got...

23:56.685 --> 23:59.437
everything I asked my mother for.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.816
Yeah.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.776
You get a free candy cane?

24:04.860 --> 24:07.153
I'm trying to limit
my intake of sugar.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.197
Uh-huh.

24:09.323 --> 24:12.117
[Woman] You can go see Santa now.
Okay, come on.

24:12.201 --> 24:14.369
Go ahead.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.665
[Santa] Nice to meet you.
[Child] Bye-bye.

24:18.749 --> 24:22.544
Bye-bye, darlin'.

24:24.088 --> 24:27.549
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, how do you do?

24:27.633 --> 24:29.759
Would you like to come
and sit on my knee?

24:29.844 --> 24:33.596
Good. Up we go. There we are.
Now then, what's your name?

24:33.681 --> 24:36.474
Susan Elizabeth Walker.
What's yours?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.935
Mine?

24:39.019 --> 24:41.229
Well, I have lots of names.

24:41.313 --> 24:45.483
Uh, Kriss Kringle,
Santa Claus, Father Christmas,
St. Nicholas.

24:45.568 --> 24:48.236
If you were in Holland,
I’d be Sinterklaas.

24:48.320 --> 24:51.281
Or in Italy, la Befana.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.950
I have to speak many languages,
because, of course,

24:54.034 --> 24:56.327
I travel, as you know,
a great deal.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.333
That's Russian.

25:02.418 --> 25:06.838
That's Swahili.

25:06.922 --> 25:11.801
My mother's Mrs. Walker. She's
director of special events for Cole's.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.095
- Uh-huh.
- She runs the parade.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.223
- Oh.
- I know how this all works.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.767
You're an employee of Cole's.

25:21.395 --> 25:24.898
That is true.
But you're a very good
Santa Claus.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.108
Thank you.
Your beard's stuck on real tight.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.945
Usually the store Santa Claus
whiskers are too loose.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.989
Right.
But yours look realistic.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.742
Because they are real.
You give them a tug.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.620
Whoo!

25:38.704 --> 25:41.247
- Are you convinced?
- Mm-hmm.

25:41.332 --> 25:44.250
[Kriss] Good.
This isn't the regular Santa suit, is it?

25:44.335 --> 25:48.296
Oh, no. This is
the real Santa suit.

25:48.422 --> 25:51.007
It's very nice.
I agree. It's lovely.

25:51.091 --> 25:53.259
Gold buttons, gold thread.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.805
It's as real as me.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.350
Well, you ask your daddy
if I'm real.

26:00.434 --> 26:03.603
- I don't know where he is.
- Well, he's, uh—

26:03.687 --> 26:08.274
That's my friend,
Mr. Bedford.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.652
I don't have a dad anymore.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.492
Oh.

26:17.576 --> 26:21.287
Well, now, what can I
get you for Christmas?

26:21.372 --> 26:24.749
- Nothing, thank you.
- Nothing?

26:24.833 --> 26:28.711
My mother buys my gifts.
If I don't want something too stupid...

26:28.796 --> 26:31.422
or dangerous or-

26:31.507 --> 26:33.758
Hi, Mom.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.646
Good morning, Mrs. Walker.
It's nice to see you again.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.199
Thank you, thank you.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.500
Susan, I think you've taken enough
of this man's time.

26:49.784 --> 26:53.069
There's a very long line of customers,
and they do come first.

26:56.699 --> 26:58.616
Nice to meet you, Susan.

26:59.702 --> 27:02.537
Nice to meet you too.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.872
Bye-bye.

27:10.921 --> 27:13.298
Nonbelievers.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.550
Right.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.141
If I felt that it was
important for her
to see Santa Claus,

27:23.225 --> 27:25.685
I would be
more than happy
to take her.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.563
I didn't see any harm in her saying
hello to an interesting old man.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.482
Well, there is harm.
I tell her...

27:31.567 --> 27:33.609
that there is
no Santa Claus.

27:33.736 --> 27:37.488
Mm-hmm.
So you bring her down here
and she sees...

27:37.573 --> 27:42.827
thousands of gullible kids,
and she meets an actor-
a very good actor, mind you-

27:42.911 --> 27:45.830
with a real beard
and a beautiful Santa suit,

27:45.914 --> 27:49.917
sitting smack dab in the center
of a child's fantasy world.

27:50.002 --> 27:53.504
So, who does she believe?

27:53.589 --> 27:56.132
The myth...

27:56.216 --> 27:59.260
or the mom?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.268
Listen, I just got
some mistletoe.

28:08.604 --> 28:11.814
Why don't we go back
to my place and try it out?

28:11.899 --> 28:16.444
No, I don't think so.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.949
Okay.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.578
I'm here. I can help.
All you have to do is ask.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.622
Well, actually,
there is one thing.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.961
Would you mind
taking Susan home?

28:36.757 --> 28:39.217
Sure.

29:13.627 --> 29:16.254
The reason I haven't
been to see you is...

29:16.338 --> 29:19.841
I'm working at Cole's.

29:19.925 --> 29:24.137
All I have to do
is to be myself.

29:27.141 --> 29:30.560
There you are.
That's it.

29:30.644 --> 29:32.812
There you go.
There you go.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.398
- [Man] Excuse me.
- Oh?

29:35.524 --> 29:36.835
Good evening.

29:37.036 --> 29:40.036
Good evening.
My name is Jack Duff.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.014
How do you do?

29:41.215 --> 29:42.915
Very well, thank you.
This is Alberta Leonard.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.450
- How do you do?
- Pleasure.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.702
Nice to meet you both.
I'm Kriss Kringle.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.456
Well, Mr. Kringle,

29:51.540 --> 29:54.041
we're with Shopper's Express,
the department store.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.003
Oh, yes. You've got
the Peter Polliwog on sale.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.340
Right.
Yes, we do.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.759
We want you to be
our main Santa Claus.

30:03.844 --> 30:06.721
We have over
7,000 stores worldwide,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.723
but you would be
the number one guy.

30:10.434 --> 30:12.310
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

30:12.394 --> 30:15.313
but the people at Cole's
have already hired me.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.356
In fact, I've signed a contract.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.611
If you would excuse me,
it is getting a bit late.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.489
- Could we give you a ride?
- That's very kind of you, but I can walk.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.366
- I mean, it's probably out of your way.
- Where are you going?

30:27.451 --> 30:32.038
114th Street.
The Mount Carmel Senior Center.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.959
- We're going right by it.
- It's on our way.

30:37.044 --> 30:40.713
Well, thank you so much.
Uh, bye-bye, Prancer.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.966
Bye-bye, Dancer.

30:50.682 --> 30:54.018
So, tell me, Santa,
how does one guy...

30:54.102 --> 30:57.021
get to every house
around the world in one night?

30:57.105 --> 30:59.357
Ah, yes.
Well, now, that is...

30:59.441 --> 31:01.817
a vexing question,
isn't it?

31:01.902 --> 31:04.737
But you see, if you could
slow time down...

31:04.821 --> 31:08.449
so that a second
became a year, a minute
became a century...

31:08.534 --> 31:11.118
and an hour
became a millennium,

31:11.203 --> 31:14.413
well, you could manage it
quite easily, couldn't you?

31:14.498 --> 31:19.377
Mind you, I remember before-
Well, 100 years ago before
the population explosion,

31:19.461 --> 31:22.880
I could manage to deliver
all my goods and have
enough time left over...

31:22.965 --> 31:25.383
for a late supper, a nap...

31:25.467 --> 31:28.553
and a round of golf
with the Easter Bunny.

31:28.637 --> 31:32.306
He winters
in New Zealand, you know.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.148
[Kriss] Thank you both
very much indeed.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.818
And Merry Christmas to you,
Miss Leonard.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.905
Merry, merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Duff.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.283
- Same to you, sir.
- Thank you very much.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.535
Good night.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.210
He's completely
out of his mind.

32:01.295 --> 32:05.798
Imagine Cole's having a guy
as nutty as that.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.926
He could become
a problem for them.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.596
I know what you mean.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.640
[Duff] The Easter Bunny.

32:23.025 --> 32:26.402
Nice to meet you.
Good-bye now.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.573
- You don't think he's nuts, do you?
- Hmm?

32:30.657 --> 32:34.535
Well, he believes he's Santa Claus.
Absolutely believes it.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.913
Maybe that's why he's good at it.
What difference does it make?

32:37.998 --> 32:40.207
Have you looked at our stocks?
They're through the roof.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.710
Sales are up 70 percent
over last holiday.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.837
In a week, this company
has turned around.

32:44.921 --> 32:49.300
And we could go the other way just
as fast if this guy does anything wrong.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.261
- What's he gonna do?
- We don't know.

32:52.346 --> 32:56.307
If the fate of the entire
company rests on one
very unstable old man,

32:56.391 --> 32:58.976
I think you're celebrating our return
just a little too soon.

32:59.061 --> 33:02.355
I'm not worried.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.614
Hello, little one.
How are you?

33:11.740 --> 33:15.326
- Come. Well.
- She's deaf.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.079
You don't have to talk to her.
She just wanted to see you.

33:18.163 --> 33:21.165
Thank you.

33:33.095 --> 33:37.390
You are a very...

33:37.474 --> 33:40.351
beautiful young lady.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.524
What's your name?

33:49.695 --> 33:52.154
Sammy.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.908
That's a beautiful name.

33:55.992 --> 33:59.578
Now, I tell you what.

33:59.663 --> 34:03.708
Do you know
"Jingle Bells"?

34:06.420 --> 34:10.797
♪Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way ♪

34:10.882 --> 34:13.342
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪

34:13.427 --> 34:16.387

34:16.471 --> 34:19.473
Very good.

34:26.313 --> 34:31.402
Darling, what would you
like for Christmas?

34:31.485 --> 34:34.029
A doll and a bear?

34:34.114 --> 34:37.074
Well, you shall have them,
Sammy.

34:37.159 --> 34:41.328
I wish you
a merry Christmas.

34:45.542 --> 34:49.378
Thank you.
Thank you.

34:49.463 --> 34:52.547
Bye-bye.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.550
Bye.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.617
What are you doing
out of bed?

35:19.701 --> 35:23.412
Something's driving me crazy,
and I can't sleep.

35:23.538 --> 35:27.291
- Well, what's on your mind?
- Santa Claus.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.169
Mr. Kringle?
Why? What about him?

35:30.253 --> 35:33.672
He talked sign language
with a kid today.

35:33.757 --> 35:37.760
Oh. That was
considerate of him.

35:37.886 --> 35:41.472
It's weird how he knows
so much about toys and kids.

35:41.556 --> 35:44.183
He speaks Russian
and Swahili.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.687
Well, he must be quite
a learned man.

35:48.772 --> 35:54.235
He looks exactly like every
picture of Santa Claus I ever saw.

35:55.946 --> 35:59.114
Yes, I know.
That's why I chose him.

35:59.199 --> 36:03.244
You're positive he's not
the real Santa Claus?

36:04.830 --> 36:08.707
I thought that we
talked about this.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.918
You understand what he is.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.380
What if we we're wrong?
That would be extremely rude.

36:14.464 --> 36:19.260
Well, we're not wrong, sweetheart.

36:19.344 --> 36:22.471
But all my friends
believe in Santa Claus.

36:22.556 --> 36:26.350
Well, most children your age do.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.687
How come I don't?

36:29.771 --> 36:31.689
Because you know the truth,

36:31.773 --> 36:35.442
and truth is one of the most
important things in the world—

36:35.527 --> 36:40.865
to know the truth and always
be truthful with others,
and more importantly,

36:40.949 --> 36:43.909
with yourself.

36:43.994 --> 36:47.621
And believing in myths
and fantasies...

36:47.706 --> 36:51.792
just makes you... unhappy.

36:51.877 --> 36:55.504
Did you believe in Santa Claus
when you were my age?

36:56.798 --> 37:00.050
- Yes.
- Were you unhappy?

37:00.135 --> 37:04.638
Well, when all the things
that I believed in...

37:04.723 --> 37:07.266
turned out not to be true,

37:07.350 --> 37:09.935
yes, I was unhappy.

37:13.440 --> 37:16.400
Would it be okay if I
thought about this some more?

37:16.484 --> 37:19.862
Do I have to not believe
in Santa Claus right away?

37:22.157 --> 37:24.283
Come here.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.204
You have the right to believe...

37:29.289 --> 37:32.917
whatever you want
to believe.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.461
Now, I've told you the truth,
but if I am wrong,

37:35.545 --> 37:37.963
I would be glad to admit it.

37:39.132 --> 37:42.718
I'll tell you what.
You ask Mr. Kringle...

37:42.802 --> 37:46.138
for something that you
would never ask me for,

37:46.222 --> 37:49.266
and if on Christmas morning
you don't get it,

37:49.351 --> 37:54.605
you will know once and for all
the honest truth about Santa Claus.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.399
That's a very clever idea.

37:57.484 --> 38:00.194
Thank you. Now, you think
you can get some sleep?

38:00.320 --> 38:02.780
- Yep.
- Yeah? Give me a kiss.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.826
Good night.
I love you.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.871
- I love you. Good night.
- Good night.

Hey! Hey!

38:59.963 --> 39:03.257
Boy, that Cole's,
they dealt me the high hard one.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.384
I did a good job
for them last year,
and this year,

39:05.468 --> 39:07.553
they gave me the—
the royal fist.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.014
So, they just
gave you the shaft.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.058
They didn't have any grounds
on which to dismiss you.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.185
That broad that runs
the parade every year-

39:15.270 --> 39:19.273
one of these college kids with a three
ounce brain and 50 tons of attitude-

39:19.357 --> 39:22.443
she hires some wacko...

39:22.527 --> 39:24.653
right off the street
to take my place.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.573
Some wacko?
Tell me about him.

39:27.657 --> 39:29.616
The old man?
He's a loon.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.936
I mean, we got thousands
of 'em in this city.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.437
I'll say.

39:32.620 --> 39:35.414
Never had one of them
take my job, though.

39:35.498 --> 39:39.668
Hey, Tony, did you have any
contact with this old guy?

39:39.753 --> 39:43.505
Contact?
The guy came up on the float
and got right up in my face.

39:43.590 --> 39:46.383
- So, he got aggressive with you?
- He had a cane.

39:46.468 --> 39:48.886
He tried to whack me
over the head with the cane.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.388
He tried to whack you
with a cane?

39:51.473 --> 39:53.640
Isn't that what
I just said?

39:54.642 --> 39:57.686
Tony, this'll
make you feel better.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.321
I've got a little job
I want you to do for me.

40:09.783 --> 40:13.744
Uh—
What, uh-

40:13.828 --> 40:16.163
What kind of job
you have in mind?

40:16.247 --> 40:20.667
You'll see.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.428
Just be yourself.

40:31.513 --> 40:35.099
Don't even think about the camera.
You'll be just fine.

40:35.183 --> 40:38.018
Right. I must confess
I don't quite know...

40:38.103 --> 40:40.104
why they're making
such a fuss about me.

40:40.188 --> 40:44.024
Well, this is the holiday season,
and you're Santa Claus, right?

40:44.109 --> 40:47.444
To many, yes, but to others I'm just
an old man with a white beard.

40:47.529 --> 40:50.531
Yes, but you're still
the symbol of the season.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.576
You think I'm a fraud,
don't you?

40:54.702 --> 40:56.847
I think fraud is a bit
too strong of a word.

40:57.048 --> 40:58.248
But you don't believe in me.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.876
I believe that Christmas
is for children.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.170
Well, your daughter
doesn't believe in me either.

41:05.255 --> 41:09.550
I don't think that there's any
harm in not believing in a figure...

41:09.634 --> 41:12.678
that many do acknowledge
to be a fiction.

41:12.762 --> 41:15.806
Oh, but there is.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.767
I'm not just a whimsical
figure who, uh,

41:18.852 --> 41:22.855
wears a charming suit and
affects a jolly demeanor.

41:24.149 --> 41:28.652
You know, I-I-
I'm a symbol.

41:28.736 --> 41:31.488
I'm a symbol
of the human ability
to be able to...

41:31.573 --> 41:36.827
suppress the selfish
and hateful tendencies...

41:36.911 --> 41:39.079
that rule the major part
of our lives.

41:41.457 --> 41:45.169
If you can't believe,

41:45.253 --> 41:50.966
if you can't accept
anything... on faith,

41:51.050 --> 41:55.429
then you're doomed for a life
dominated by doubt.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.689
I like you very much,
Mrs. Walker.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.525
You're a fine woman.
And you know,

42:08.610 --> 42:13.614
I think you'll make
an excellent test case for me-
you and your daughter.

42:14.657 --> 42:17.451
If I could make you believe,

42:17.535 --> 42:20.996
then there'd be
some hope for me.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.957
If I can't,

42:24.042 --> 42:26.126
well, I'm finished.

42:35.637 --> 42:37.554
Shall we go?

42:41.226 --> 42:46.939
Five, four, three,
two, one.

42:47.023 --> 42:51.026
I'm Kriss Kringle, and I'm
at Cole's department store
in New York City.

42:51.152 --> 42:54.905
Good morning, America.

43:03.164 --> 43:05.874
No, Mr. Kringle's time
is extremely limited.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.462
Sorry. Mr. Bedford's
on line three.

43:10.546 --> 43:12.881
No, he can't
do private sessions.

43:12.966 --> 43:17.511
Can you hold
for just a moment?
Yeah, hang on.

43:17.595 --> 43:21.431
Hi, Bryan. I have
the mayor's office on hold.
What's up?

43:21.516 --> 43:26.144
If I can arrange a really,
really good baby-sitter
for tonight,

43:26.229 --> 43:28.188
do you wanna do some shopping
and have dinner?

43:28.273 --> 43:31.358
Well, I-I'm not sure
what I'm-

43:31.442 --> 43:33.003
I don't know if I
can get Celia tonight.

43:33.204 --> 43:34.604
I'll take care of it.

43:34.988 --> 43:38.615
- I'll see you at 7:00?
- Well, I-I-I'm not sure what-

43:38.700 --> 43:41.994
Okay, fine.
7:00. Bye.

43:47.375 --> 43:49.668
[Kriss] Whoa, back.
[Bryan] Who is this one now?

43:49.794 --> 43:52.963
This is Dancer.
He's a bit slow.

43:53.047 --> 43:57.384
Not very good with his food.
Poor old Dancer.

43:58.845 --> 44:02.222
Oh. Good evening,
Mrs. Walker.

44:02.307 --> 44:05.475
Good evening,
Mr. Kringle.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.937
Nobody at school's gonna
believe this one, huh?

44:09.022 --> 44:13.400
Well, if you have to
have a baby-sitter,
who's better qualified?

44:13.484 --> 44:17.070
Yes.

44:19.741 --> 44:21.700
Yeah.

46:01.259 --> 46:05.762

46:05.847 --> 46:10.183
Pretty, isn't it?
There really has to be something
you want for Christmas.

46:14.897 --> 46:17.357
I'm very good at keeping secrets,
you know.

46:18.359 --> 46:20.819
Come on, tell me.

46:49.974 --> 46:53.351
Oh. What's this?

47:05.781 --> 47:07.699
Gosh.

47:12.705 --> 47:15.332
That's what I want
for Christmas—

47:15.416 --> 47:18.585
a house, a brother
and a dad.

47:19.879 --> 47:22.422
That's all I ever want.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.135
- Oh.
- If you’re really Santa Claus,

47:27.220 --> 47:29.763
you can get it for me.

47:29.847 --> 47:35.185
If you can't, you're just
a nice man with a white beard
like my mother says.

47:35.269 --> 47:39.898
Oh, Susan. Just because
every child doesn't get
his or her wish...

47:39.982 --> 47:42.275
doesn't mean
there's not a Santa Claus.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.570
I thought you might
say that.

47:45.655 --> 47:48.365
Did you? Yes.

47:48.449 --> 47:51.076
Well, a house is
a very big order.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.662
And very expensive.

47:53.746 --> 47:57.165
And a baby—
Well, a baby takes, uh,

47:57.250 --> 47:59.543
almost a year to, uh-

47:59.627 --> 48:03.046
Nine months.
More if the lady's late.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.507
Less if the baby's a preemie.

48:06.801 --> 48:09.970
Right.
And a father-

48:10.054 --> 48:14.683
I mean, no one can give
anybody a father.

48:14.767 --> 48:19.396
If Santa Claus really can
make reindeer fly and go
up and down people's chimneys...

48:19.480 --> 48:23.358
and make millions of toys and
go all around the world in one night,

48:23.442 --> 48:28.572
he could get somebody a house
and a brother...

48:28.656 --> 48:31.408
and a dad, right?

48:33.619 --> 48:38.206
Right. Right, yes.
I suppose he- he could.

48:40.960 --> 48:45.338
I don't think I'll everget those
things so it's no big deal.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.091
Oh.

48:48.175 --> 48:52.679
Well, um, perhaps I could
keep this paper, could I?

48:52.763 --> 48:57.601
- Sure.
- Well, good night, little angel.

48:57.685 --> 49:00.562
Good night.

49:04.191 --> 49:08.278
- Good night, Susan.
- Good night, Mr. Kringle.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.410
A family for Christmas.

49:15.494 --> 49:17.829
I don't think so.

49:21.792 --> 49:24.586
No, really.
I mean-

49:24.712 --> 49:27.964
See, that wasn't so bad, huh?
I had a great time.

49:28.049 --> 49:30.091
You need to get out.
That's what your problem is.

49:30.176 --> 49:34.971
You need to forget work,
forget all those things that you
have to do and come out with me.

49:35.056 --> 49:37.098
But you understand
why I didn't.

49:37.183 --> 49:40.560
Sometimes I think I do,
sometimes I think I don't.

49:40.645 --> 49:44.397
Well, you are a very patient man.

49:44.482 --> 49:47.400
Most guys are gone after
a few months of me.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.736
Oh, so you admit
that you're rough on men.

49:49.862 --> 49:52.530
No, I'm not just rough on men.

49:52.615 --> 49:55.408
Yeah, I admit it.

49:55.493 --> 49:58.203
I'm careful.
At this point in my life,

49:58.287 --> 50:00.914
I really don't need
to be disappointed.

50:06.837 --> 50:10.674
Do you want one of your
Christmas presents early?
I got you a present,

50:10.758 --> 50:12.926
and I want to give it to you.

50:13.052 --> 50:17.472
- What is it?
- Do you want it early?

50:17.556 --> 50:19.808
Well, yes.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.112
What is it?

50:32.196 --> 50:35.115
Open it.

50:53.551 --> 50:56.428
It's an engagement ring.

51:00.307 --> 51:03.893
If I've given you...

51:03.978 --> 51:08.022
a false impression
of this relationship,

51:08.107 --> 51:10.608
I'm very sorry.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.322
Are you serious?

51:17.491 --> 51:20.702
Have I ever given you any sign...

51:20.786 --> 51:24.038
that I wanted to marry you?

51:26.083 --> 51:28.168
- No.
- Then tell me,

51:28.252 --> 51:31.337
what ever possessed you
to make such a presumption?

51:33.007 --> 51:35.717
You know, I've done everything
I could to try to make you happy.

51:35.801 --> 51:38.720
I love your daughter
like she's my own,

51:38.804 --> 51:42.223
I loved you,
getting nothing in return,

51:42.308 --> 51:45.351
never asking
for anything in return.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.523
I put my faith in you.

51:53.194 --> 51:55.945
Well, if that’s true,

51:56.030 --> 51:58.698
then you're a fool.

52:40.825 --> 52:44.327
- Good evening. Taxi, please.
- Certainly.

52:55.548 --> 52:58.967
- Mr. Bedford.
- Kriss.

52:59.093 --> 53:04.013
- How was your night as a babysitter?
- Oh, very pleasant.

53:04.098 --> 53:07.183
- Yeah, Susan's a good kid.
- Yes.

53:07.268 --> 53:10.270
Delightful, delightful.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.982
Well, how was it?

53:15.276 --> 53:19.779
- I gave her an engagement ring.
- Oh. Oh.

53:22.741 --> 53:24.021
She didn't like it very much.

53:24.222 --> 53:28.022
Well, perhaps your timing
wasn't particularly good.

53:28.247 --> 53:31.332
No. Not at all.

53:31.417 --> 53:35.378
She's- She's, um,
a sad sort of person.

53:35.462 --> 53:38.756
It's a pity, really.
I mean, she's very kind.

53:38.883 --> 53:43.469
But she's terribly careful
about her emotions.

53:45.472 --> 53:48.016
What I know about Dorey
is pieced together...

53:48.100 --> 53:50.602
from fragments
of a dozen conversations.

53:50.686 --> 53:54.397
She was married in college,
he had a drinking problem,

53:54.481 --> 53:58.276
and right after Susan was born,
he took off and hasn't
been heard of since.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.778
- Hmm.
- She's filled with these—

54:00.863 --> 54:04.407
these bitter thoughts, and-

54:04.491 --> 54:07.911
The worst part about it
is that she's dragging
Susan into this with her.

54:07.995 --> 54:11.623
Yes. Well, Susan
is struggling with it.

54:11.707 --> 54:14.709
But I get the feeling
she really does want to
believe in me, you know?

54:14.793 --> 54:18.630
She's a good girl.
She's loyal to her mother's wishes.

54:18.714 --> 54:20.715
I can't fault that.

54:20.799 --> 54:24.427
But of course,
if I can't convince the mother,

54:24.511 --> 54:27.347
I have no hope
of convincing the child.

54:30.684 --> 54:33.519
Tooth Fairy told me that.

54:33.604 --> 54:37.523
Well, your cab's here, Kriss.

54:37.608 --> 54:40.443
Oh.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.446
I always wondered what guys who
have to return engagement rings...

54:43.530 --> 54:45.657
say to the sales clerk
at the jewelry store.

54:49.078 --> 54:52.455
Now I don't wanna know.

54:52.539 --> 54:56.000
I'm sure in your line of work you can
find some lucky guy to give this to.

54:58.837 --> 55:01.130
It's very generous
of you, but I-

55:01.215 --> 55:05.176
I don't think this ring
will ever fit anyone
other than Mrs. Walker.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.595
I'm sure you'll find somebody.

55:07.721 --> 55:11.349
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. I'll get over it.

55:11.433 --> 55:13.726
And Susan?

55:16.605 --> 55:20.650
Well, I know what you
want for Christmas now.

55:22.069 --> 55:24.529
- I'll see what I can do.
- Good night.

55:24.613 --> 55:27.532
Good night.

55:39.712 --> 55:42.672
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

55:55.811 --> 55:58.229
[Woman] Come on. It's your turn
to go up now. Go ahead.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.859
Hello.

56:02.943 --> 56:05.278
- What do you want for Christmas?
- A bike.

56:05.362 --> 56:07.697
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please step aside?

56:07.781 --> 56:10.575
This is for the children.

56:10.659 --> 56:13.202
Hot little helper
you got here, huh, Santa?

56:15.247 --> 56:19.500
She the one that puts
the, uh, twinkle in your eye?

56:20.711 --> 56:24.005
Hey, kids,

56:24.089 --> 56:26.507
you see that guy
up there?

56:26.592 --> 56:29.927
He's not really Santa Claus.
He doesn't even live at the North Pole.

56:30.012 --> 56:34.891
He lives in a nursing home
on 114th street.

56:34.975 --> 56:37.435
You know what he is?

56:37.519 --> 56:41.189
He's a big, fat fake!

56:47.613 --> 56:51.365
Yeah. Just a fake.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.452
Ho, ho, ho.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.590
Hey! Goofball!

57:49.716 --> 57:53.052
- Huh?
- Yeah, you, numb nuts.

57:53.137 --> 57:57.306
What is a guy your age
playing this game for, huh?

57:57.391 --> 58:00.601
I mean, are you just a lonely,
pathetic mental case?

58:00.686 --> 58:03.271
Or does it go a little bit
deeper than that?

58:03.355 --> 58:05.189
Is there a darker side to this?

58:05.274 --> 58:08.901
Tell me something,
you sorry old cripple, you.

58:08.986 --> 58:13.197
You got a thing
for the little ones, huh?
Huh? Huh?

58:13.282 --> 58:18.286
'Cause they ain't much good for
nothin' else, are they? Huh?

58:26.253 --> 58:29.755
[Duff] Stop that man!

58:29.840 --> 58:32.425
Quickly!

58:32.509 --> 58:35.261
Get the cane away from him.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.723
I-I didn't intend
to injure him.

58:38.807 --> 58:40.725
He baited me.
He provoked me.

58:40.809 --> 58:45.188
- Save it for the cops, sir.
- He's badly hurt.

58:45.272 --> 58:50.193
Wait a second. You're—
You're Cole's Santa Claus!

58:50.277 --> 58:54.655
Cole's Santa Claus?

59:01.955 --> 59:05.958
[Kriss] He said the most terrible—

59:08.629 --> 59:10.546
[Officer] Clear the way, folks, please.

59:10.631 --> 59:13.549
[Officer #2] All right, folks.
Show's over.

59:13.634 --> 59:16.636
- Please, step back.
- [Man] Take it easy, Officer.

59:25.229 --> 59:28.147
[Woman Over TV]
You might want to clear
the kids out of the room...

59:28.232 --> 59:30.274
before we read
this next story.

59:30.359 --> 59:35.238
It appears that New York's
most famous Santa Claus
has a mean streak.

59:35.322 --> 59:40.493
The centerpiece of
C.F. Cole's big holiday ad push
is behind bars this morning.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.954
[Woman #2 Over TV]
...plans regarding a
replacement for Mr. Kringle.

59:43.038 --> 59:47.583
The spokesperson did say,
however, that for at least
the remainder of today,

59:47.668 --> 59:50.711
there will be no Santa Claus
at the 34th Street store.

59:50.796 --> 59:53.089
[Man Over TV]
...without any apparent provocation,

59:53.173 --> 59:55.466
struck him repeatedly
with a walking stick.

59:55.550 --> 59:58.844
Police arrived within moments
and arrested Kringle.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.973
[Woman #3 Over TV]
Planning to take your children
to the store today, take note.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:06.435
There will be no Santa Claus
at the 34th Street store.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.981
C.F. Cole's competitors
are having the last laugh
this morning.

01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:02.199
[Kriss' Voice] I'm not just a whimsical
figure who wears a charming suit...

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:05.161
and affects a jolly demeanor,
you know.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:08.205
I'm a symbol. I'm a symbol
of the human ability...

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:12.626
to suppress the selfish
and hateful tendencies...

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.629
that rule the major part
of our lives.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:19.175
And if you can't
accept anything on faith,

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:23.721
then you're doomed to a life
dominated by doubt.

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:31.020
Get me Bryan Bedford
on the phone.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:42.698
Bryan?

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:45.159
I know.
I saw the papers.

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:50.581
I want you to help him.
He's at Bellevue, and I
don't know what's happening.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:53.376
But he's alone,
and he shouldn't be.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.504
What's Cole's position?
Do the attorneys have an opinion?

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:59.715
This isn't about Cole's.
This is about a man...

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.927
who has had something
very wrong done to him.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:08.474
Somebody you care about.
Somebody... you believe in.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:31.080
Come in.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:34.844
Your Honor, do you have
a moment for Ed Collins?

01:02:35.045 --> 01:02:36.345
Send him in.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:40.005
Thanks.

01:02:40.132 --> 01:02:42.984
How are you, Eddie?
What can I do for you?

01:02:43.185 --> 01:02:43.985
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.429
Oh, just the ah... commitment papers
for Cole's Santa.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.889
Oh, boy,
that's a shocker, huh?

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:51.225
- The press is having a field day.
- "Age unknown."

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:54.728
- Old man, is he?
- Very old, Your Honor.

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:57.022
Am I going to have
to read all this?

01:02:57.107 --> 01:03:00.818
No, it's a slam dunk.
The guy's out of his mind.
We'd like it over quick.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.071
- "We"?
- Victor.

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:07.867
- "Victor"?
- Landbergh.

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.496
- Oh, yes.
- There.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:19.044
Well, justice will have
to prevail, of course.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.548
Oh, of course.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:27.386
Yes, justice will have to prevail.
As always.

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:31.599
Money makes the world
go around, Eddie.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.102
Yes, it does, Your Honor.
It sure does.

01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:37.188
By the way, Mr. Landbergh
wanted me to tell you...

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:42.193
that he's very well aware
of your, uh, reelection campaign
coming up this spring.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:44.945
Tell him I would welcome
his support.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:47.531
Will do.

01:03:47.616 --> 01:03:49.658
Come in.

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:52.453
- A Mr. Bedford's here to see you.
- Who?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.914
He represents Mr. Kringle.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:03:59.585
Send him in.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:06.342
Your Honor, there seems to be
some undue haste in this case.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:09.053
I wish to protect my client's rights,
as I'm sure you do.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:12.264
- Mr. Prosecutor, this is, uh-
- Bryan Bedford.

01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:14.391
Ed Collins.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:19.563
If Your Honor pleases,
I request a formal hearing
where I may bring witnesses.

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:22.566
You can sign
the commitment papers
now if you like,

01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:25.361
but I'll bring in
habeas corpus this afternoon.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.951
We'll have a hearing.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:34.870
Thursday morning,
9:00 a.m.?

01:04:34.955 --> 01:04:38.374
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Collins.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:40.376
Mr. Bedford.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.759
I though you said the old man
didn't have an attorney.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:52.638
What difference does it make?
It's gonna be a hearing, not a jury trial.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:56.517
You're the only one
that has to be convinced.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.939
Have a good day, Judge.

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:05.734
Wanna know something,
mister?

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:09.780
I don't believe it.
This guy ain't dangerous.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:14.034
He may be off his rails
a little bit, but he ain't no thug.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:18.747
And if he wants
to call himself Santa Claus,
then God bless him.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.849
Hello, Kriss.

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:40.269
Hello, Mr. Bedford.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:45.566
What brings you out
on a miserable day like this?

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:50.779
A friend in need.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:06:00.039
You failed your mental exam
on purpose, didn't you?

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:07.463
Why would I...
do a thing like that?

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.257
I don't know.

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:13.969
Maybe you've served people
long enough.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:19.016
- Maybe you've given all you have to give.
- No.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.811
Then why did you do it?
The charges against you were dropped.

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:26.398
The man you hit
suffered no injury.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.401
You could've been out of here
if you’d passed your exam.

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.238
I disgraced myself.

01:06:45.126 --> 01:06:49.254
I read your transcript, Kriss.
You defended your honor.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.174
You stood up for the dignity
of every child.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:54.593
That isn't a disgrace.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.595
That's decency.

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:03.519
If I'm dismissed
as a crazy old man,

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.855
then the good name
of Santa Claus is spared.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.066
That isn't true.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:14.446
If not for you,
there is no Santa Claus.
You are him.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.074
Crazy or not, here or gone,
you're Santa Claus.

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:20.160
Only if the children
believe that.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:24.123
And what kind of Santa Claus
were they believing in anyway?

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.125
They can't
look to me anymore.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:29.169
Not after knowing what
happened the other night.

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:31.880
Well, think about
the other night.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:34.007
A man was there
to photograph the incident?

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:37.136
The man you hit
was the man you replaced?

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:41.432
The cops told me this, Kriss.
The cops believe in you.

01:07:41.516 --> 01:07:43.976
A lot of people do.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.311
More will when we're finished.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:48.355
- Finished with what?
- We're going to court.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.024
There's a hearing Thursday
to decide if you’re
to be committed.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:55.320
I'm going to defend you.
Together, we're gonna prove
that there is a Santa Claus...

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.448
and that you're him.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.125
I'm ready, Counselor.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.713
Now, we have a few days
to distance ourselves...

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:16.341
from this scandal
and restart our advertising.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.470
Uh, Mrs. Walker,
we are in conference.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.680
I have just read
your press release.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:25.559
You are all such
a bunch of cowards!

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.644
You really don't deserve
to run the store.

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.689
You are entirely
out of line, Mrs. Walker.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:35.527
We have spent millions telling people
that we are the store that cares.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.279
Well, what is it
that we care about?

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:41.283
Profits? Ourselves?
Our jobs?

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.993
What about one of our own
who needs us now?

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.461
Well, what am I to do?

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:57.758
The public perception of Kriss is that
he's out of his mind, he's dangerous.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:09:01.428
We have to change that.

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:05.015
If we stand with Kriss,

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:08.644
if we challenge the rumors
and the scandal sheets,

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:11.563
if we force the truth,
we'll win.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:15.317
He's going into court with...

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:18.069
the best attorney in the city,

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:22.366
and he's going to prove
that Kriss is not crazy.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:30.040
For the sake
of the whole company,

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:33.544
I think that all of you
should decide...

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:37.130
about whether or not you...

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.133
believe in Santa Claus.

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.767
Bring up two. Go.

01:09:48.852 --> 01:09:53.188
For the last 75 years,
Cole's has invited Santa Claus...

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:58.068
to meet and greet
the children of New York City
in our 34th Street store.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:02.030
Cole's believes in Santa Claus,

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:05.701
and we will stand by him.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:10.372
He has done nothing but serve
the children and the families
of New York City...

01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:12.708
and the world.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:18.338
We invite you to join with us and ask 
ourself this one simple question:

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.217
Do you believe in Santa Claus?

You'll be fine. All you have
to do is tell the truth.

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:44.091
Who's that character
in the gray suit?

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:48.220
- That's the prosecutor.
- Oh.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.389
Anything I should know
about him?

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.309
Yeah. He doesn't
believe in Santa Claus.

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.520
- Ah.
- [Man] All rise.

01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:02.818
Oyez, oyez. Let all those
who have business before
this court come forward.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:08.198
The honorable Justice Harper presiding.
Draw near and ye shall be heard.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.242
You may sit.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.164
Your Honor, in the matter
of Kriss Kringle,

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.166
the commitment papers
are on your desk.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:22.170
With Your Honor's permission,
I'd like to call the first witness.

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:25.757
Mr. Kringle, would you
please take the stand?

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:30.512
It's okay.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.063
Good morning, Judge.

01:12:42.066 --> 01:12:44.109
How's that grandson of yours?

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.612
The parade.

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:50.490
He thought I looked
like Santa Claus.

01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:53.910
O-Oh- Oh, yes.

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:58.123
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:12:58.249 --> 01:13:00.527
Yes. Don't I put
my hand on a Bible?

01:13:00.728 --> 01:13:01.728
No, sir, you don't.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:06.298
Oh. Well, then, I'll put
my hand over my heart instead.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.508
I do. I do!

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.470
[Bailiff] Sit down, please.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.647
What is your name?

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.649
Oh.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.861
I'm so sorry.
I didn't introduce myself.
I do beg your pardon.

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:31.031
You're Mr. Collins.
I'm Mr. Kringle. Kriss Kringle.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.202
Order.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:40.624
- Kriss Kringle.
- Yes, double "K."

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:46.046
Tell me, Mr. Kringle,
do you believe that
you are Santa Claus?

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:49.800
Well, would I be here
if I didn't?

01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:54.179
Just yes or no, Mr. Kringle.
Do you believe that
you are Santa Claus?

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.476
Yes, of course.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:05.649
[Collins] Santa Claus.

01:14:05.733 --> 01:14:08.652
Hmm.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:11.154
State rests, Your Honor.

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:16.368
Mr. Bedford, do you wish
to cross-examine the witness?

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.495
No further questions,
Your Honor.

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:21.164
- You may step down, Mr. Kringle.
- Oh, thank you.

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:24.292
Mr. Bedford, in view
of your client's statement,

01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.461
do you still wish
to put in a defense?

01:14:26.546 --> 01:14:28.755
Yes, Your Honor.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.757
I should like to call
my first witness.

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.934
Can you tell us your name?

01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:43.520
My name is Daniel Lowry.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.399
And what'd you get
for Christmas last year, Daniel?

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:51.236
Um, a bike, and, um-

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.488
- And who gave you the bike?
- Him.

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:57.325
- [Bryan] What's his name?
- Santa Claus.

01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:59.578
- Are you sure he's Santa Claus?
- Yep.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:02.914
- How can you be sure?
- 'Cause he looks like Santa Claus.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:07.169
Any other reasons?

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.588
- Um, he's very nice,
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:13.425
and he works at Cole's,
and he's got elves.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:18.221
Tell me something, Daniel.
Could that man be Santa Claus?

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.432
- [Daniel] Nope.
- Why not?

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.268
Because Santa don't got
a grumpy face.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.772
Order.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:33.653
No further questions.

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:39.117
Mr. Collins, do you wish
to cross-examine the witness?

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:41.119
No, Your Honor.
No questions.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:45.040
Do I have to go to jail now?

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:48.627
No. You can go
back to your seat.

01:15:50.254 --> 01:15:54.549
Your Honor, I should like
to call my next witness.

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:56.593
Mrs. Rebecca Collins.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:06.811
Order.

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:18.573
[Bailiff] Do you swear to tell the truth,

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:21.284
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.371
- [Mrs. Collins] I do.
- Sit down, please.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:30.418
- Do you have children, Mrs. Collins?
- I have two.

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:33.588
- How old are they?
- Four and seven.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.132
- Do they believe in Santa Claus?
- I object, Your Honor.

01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:38.510
On what grounds,
Mr. Collins?

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.512
As the court knows,
the witness is my wife.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:44.349
Mr. Bedford is deliberately
harassing her solely in order
to embarrass me...

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.102
and expose private matters
to the court.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.646
Your Honor, I'm merely
attempting to establish that Mr. Collins,

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:53.191
like so many others,
has taught his children
that there is a Santa Claus.

01:16:53.276 --> 01:16:55.360
Objection overruled.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:59.114
- You may continue.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:02.575
Mrs. Collins, do your children
believe in Santa Claus?

01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:06.288
- Yes.
- Did they come to this belief naturally,

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:09.749
or were they introduced to it
by a family member?

01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.710
Um, it was
a family member.

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.962
- Yourself?
- Yes.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:16.381
And your husband?

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.760
Yes.

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:25.724
Your husband told
your children that
there is a Santa Claus?

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:27.726
Yes.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.937
On more than one occasion?

01:17:31.022 --> 01:17:33.773
[Mrs. Collins] Um, yeah.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:36.818
Mrs. Collins, have you
taken your children to see...

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.112
a department store Santa Claus
this year?

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:41.114
- Yes, we have.
- Where?

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.992
- At Cole's.
- So your children have met Mr. Kringle?

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:47.037
Oh, yes.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:50.081
- [Bryan] And they accepted him as Santa Claus?
- Yes.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.335
Did the question of Mr. Kringle's
authenticity arise at any time...

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.420
before or after
your children met him?

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.256
Uh, yes, it was after.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:01.968
[Bryan] And did you deny or confirm...

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:04.387
that Mr. Kringle
is the real Santa Claus?

01:18:04.472 --> 01:18:06.723
You're under oath now,
Mrs. Collins.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:20.528
Um, well, actually, my— my husband confirmed
that he's the real Santa Claus.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:31.456
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Thank you, Mrs. Collins.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:35.377
- Merry Christmas.
- [Judge] Mr. Collins,

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:39.130
do you wish to cross-examine...
your wife?

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:47.305
I object. This is irrelevant
and immaterial, to say nothing
of being absolutely ridiculous.

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:49.474
Mr. Bedford is making
a mockery of this court.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:53.812
He has not even established that there
is such a person as Santa Claus.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:58.858
I would ask Mr. Collins
if he could offer any proof
that there is no Santa Claus.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.279
Your Honor, I'd like
a recess until tomorrow...

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:09.202
so that I might
adequately prepare to meet
Mr. Bedford's challenge.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:12.539
- Mr. Bedford, do you have any objections?
- No, Your Honor.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:20.130
This court stands in recess
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:30.598
He bought it.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:32.767
I knew if I got him angry enough
he'd take the offensive.

01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:37.480
There's no way in a court of law
we can prove that Santa Claus
exists or that you're him.

01:19:37.565 --> 01:19:41.443
Haven't you given Mr. Collins
the opportunity of proving
that I don't exist?

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.946
Exactly. You see,
he'll go too far.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.740
Our best defense is to let
Collins hang himself.

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:52.871
- Oh. Oh, I see.
- But you have to promise me one thing:

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:56.124
- You'll speak only when I tell you to.
- Oh, you have my word.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.168
Good. Come on.

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:22.484
Hi. I, uh-

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:27.030
I just wanted to thank you for
everything that you're doing for Kriss.

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:30.074
I was in the gallery.
I don't know if you saw me.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:34.078
- I still have a long way to go.
- I think you'll do it.

01:20:34.205 --> 01:20:38.625
- I hope you will.
- I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:47.759
Um, about... last week.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:51.763
I'm sorry.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.098
I mean it.
I'm really, really sorry.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.519
I was... just-

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:00.563
Scared?

01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:06.986
Yes.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:12.408
Well, no permanent damage.

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:20.500
- Well, I—
- Uh, yeah, I have to go.

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:23.711
- I have to pick Susan up from school.
- How's she doing?

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:27.966
She's good. She's good.
I think she... misses you.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:32.595
Tell her I said hello.

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.687
Well-

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:53.700
Indeed there was.
St. Nicholas, otherwise
known as Santa Claus,

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:57.579
was a fourth century bishop
in Myra Lycia, Asia Minor.

01:21:57.663 --> 01:22:02.250
Dr. Hunter, what is
the Church's position
on St. Nicholas?

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.168
He's a recognized saint.

01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:07.880
[Collins] But isn't it true that in 1969
Pope Paul VI...

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:12.677
eliminated the official celebration
of the Feast Day of St. Nicholas?

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:17.265
That's correct. It was made
an optional memorial day.

01:22:17.349 --> 01:22:20.977
They downgraded it.
In essence,

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:24.022
the Church walked away
from St. Nicholas.

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:28.568
Now, doesn't it also
stand to reason that they would
walk away from the derivative,

01:22:28.652 --> 01:22:31.738
diluted secular figure
of Santa Claus?

01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:35.199
[Dr. Hunter] I presume so.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.954
Thank you, Dr. Hunter.

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:44.208
But the Church has not
made it clear what its pos-

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:47.754
No further questions.

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:51.090
[Bryan] It's all right, Kriss.

01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:53.760
He's just trying
to get under your skin.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:56.971
Colonel, have you ever
been to the North Pole?

01:22:57.056 --> 01:23:00.600
Yes, sir. In 1972
and again in 1984.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:03.853
- Did you explore the region?
- Extensively.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:09.484
Did you ever find any evidence
of dwellings, animal pens,
barns, workshops?

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:13.404
- No, sir.
- [Collins] No evidence whatsoever?

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.949
- None, sir.
- Tell me something, Colonel.

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:22.872
In your opinion, would it
be possible for an individual,
like Mr. Kringle over there,

01:23:22.956 --> 01:23:27.543
to create a settlement
in that inhospitable region
large enough to manufacture...

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:32.924
at least one toy for each
and every one of the Earth's
1 .7 billion children?

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.551
No, sir.

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:40.390
But there isn't any way in which
the gentleman can have seen
my workshops. They're invisible.

01:23:40.474 --> 01:23:43.059
[Bryan] Kriss, sit down.

01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:46.771
But— But Mr. Collins
is completely mistaken.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.107
My workshops don't exist
in the physical world.

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:51.150
They're in the dream world.

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.153
Let me be the lawyer.

01:23:57.408 --> 01:24:01.077
I always thought that was
completely understood.

01:24:01.145 --> 01:24:03.079
Your Honor,
with the court's permission,

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:05.957
I'd like to call
my next witness.

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:25.727
- Mr. Collins, what is this?
- This... is a reindeer, Your Honor.

01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:30.732
[Judge] I know that, but what's
it doing in my courtroom?

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:34.068
I'd like the court to see
Mr. Kringle make the reindeer fly.

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:37.238
He's baiting you.
He wants you to lose your temper.

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:39.699
He wants you to act crazy.
Remember that.

01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:42.827
Mr. Kringle, we're waiting.

01:24:44.788 --> 01:24:47.248
Well, hello.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:52.962
Well, I would greatly
like to oblige, Mr. Collins,

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:55.298
but I cannot make
this reindeer fly.

01:24:55.382 --> 01:24:58.092
I didn't think so.

01:24:58.177 --> 01:25:00.887
He only flies on Christmas Eve.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:08.394
Yes, of course, Mr. Kringle.
No further questions, Your Honor.

01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:13.065
Well, in that case, would
somebody please remove the wit-
the animal from the courtroom?

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:17.570
Your Honor,
the state of New York
has absolutely no desire...

01:25:17.654 --> 01:25:20.114
in laying waste
to a popular myth.

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:22.116
But this case
is not about mythology.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:27.163
It's about the mental competency 
of a man- that man, Kriss Kringle.

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:30.458
Now, everyone
in this courtroom,

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.336
if they were entirely honest
with themselves,

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.254
would have to conclude,
based on the evidence,

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:39.050
that Mr. Kringle,
regrettably, is insane.

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:45.681
Now, as a sworn guardian of the
laws of the state of New York,

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:49.185
as a citizen and as a father,
it is my wish that Mr. Kringle,

01:25:49.269 --> 01:25:52.146
who masquerades as Santa Claus,

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:56.234
a figure of benevolence
and generosity,

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:59.403
but who does so solely for profit-

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:02.240
That's not true!

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:04.450
Your Honor-

01:26:04.535 --> 01:26:08.162
Mr. Kringle will refrain
from comment, or he will
be removed from the courtroom.

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:11.165
Sit down.
Sit down, Kriss.

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:16.379
Your Honor, I was not aware
that Cole's department store
was a charitable institution.

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:21.050
If it is, I'm more than willing
to apologize to the court
and to Mr. Kringle.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.346
I didn't think so, Your Honor.

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:30.142
As I was saying before I was
so rudely interrupted,
it is my wish, Your Honor,

01:26:30.227 --> 01:26:34.272
that Mr. Kringle be placed
under the care of the state...

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:38.651
so that the children
of New York...

01:26:38.735 --> 01:26:40.695
will no longer be put at risk.

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:43.823
Hey, you big jerk!

01:26:43.907 --> 01:26:47.201
Mr. Kringle's the nicest man in the world!

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:49.537
He'd never hurt anybody!

01:26:49.621 --> 01:26:52.540
[Judge] Order! Order!

01:26:52.624 --> 01:26:55.668
- Sit down.
- Order!

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:58.588
Order!

01:26:58.672 --> 01:27:01.674
I have nothing further
to say, Your Honor.

01:27:01.758 --> 01:27:04.302
Kriss, sit down.
We're almost through.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:08.556
It's okay.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.436
Mr. Bedford, do you wish
to make a closing statement?

01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:20.985
Your Honor, a lot of people
believe in Mr. Kringle,

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.362
including millions of children.

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:27.283
If you rule against him,
you won't destroy anyone's belief,

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.827
but you will destroy
the man they believe in.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:32.872
Mr. Kringle
is not concerned for himself.

01:27:32.956 --> 01:27:34.874
If he was,
he wouldn't be here.

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:37.585
He is in this
regrettable position...

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:41.672
because he is willing to
sacrifice himself for children,

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:46.677
to create in their minds
a world far better than
the one we've made for them.

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:50.806
If this is,
as Mr. Collins suggests,
a masquerade,

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:56.228
then Mr. Kringle is eager
to forfeit his freedom...
to preserve that masquerade,

01:27:56.313 --> 01:27:59.273
to subject himself
to prosecution,

01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:02.860
to protect the childrens'
right to believe.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:11.535
If this court finds that Mr. Kringle
is not who he says he is,

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:15.706
that there is no Santa Claus,
then I would ask the court
to judge which is worse:

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:19.418
a lie that draws a smile...

01:28:20.879 --> 01:28:25.049
or a truth...
that draws a tear.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:35.893
I rest my case.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:44.819
I shall render my opinion on this
matter at 12:00 noon tomorrow.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.698
Until that time,
this court stands in recess.

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:07.591
- Counselor.
- Hello, Judge.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.596
I appreciate you waiting for me.
Sit down.

01:29:15.976 --> 01:29:19.770
How did I get on this case?

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:24.191
I don't wanna rule
against your client,

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:29.155
but I can't see how,
given the facts,
I can do otherwise.

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:34.660
A man who believes himself
to be someone he isn't is,
by definition, disturbed.

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:37.830
He isn't dangerous.
He isn't a threat.

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:43.210
I can't sit up on that bench
as a representative
of the state of New York...

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:45.588
and declare that
there is a Santa Claus.

01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:48.632
I can't make that argument,

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:52.219
as much as I'd like to.

01:29:52.304 --> 01:29:57.516
Believe me, Mr. Bedford,
if I had a way out of this,

01:29:57.601 --> 01:30:00.770
I'd take it.

01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:03.522
I'm sorry.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.524
It's all about money,
isn't it?

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:15.534
You know what destroyed
Kriss Kringle?

01:30:15.619 --> 01:30:18.996
Power, greed and this.

01:30:22.876 --> 01:30:26.796
Anger and recrimination
may soothe your soul,
but it won't help Mr. Kringle.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.674
He doesn't need a bitter
epilogue from his attorney.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.720
He needs a miracle.

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:06.395
[Bailiff] All rise.

01:32:09.733 --> 01:32:12.401
You may sit.

01:32:18.158 --> 01:32:22.620
Having heard the evidence
in the matter of Kriss Kringle,

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:27.625
I, Judge Henry Harper,
a representative
of the state of New York,

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:32.922
must regrettably rule on this day,
the 24th of December,

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:36.091
in the year-

01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:43.933
Would it please the court
if I gave you a Christmas card?

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:46.894
I probably won't get
another chance to see you...

01:32:46.978 --> 01:32:49.855
unless I get arrested,
which is very unlikely,

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:54.652
since it's Christmas Eve
and I'm going to bed
uncharacteristically early.

01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:00.241
Uh-

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:03.661
- Thank you very much, young lady.
- You're entirely welcome.

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:07.998
And, uh, merry Christmas.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:10.751
Merry Christmas to you.

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:19.843
What were you doing?

01:33:59.092 --> 01:34:01.051
Merry Christmas.

01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:10.811
I'm not gonna be
needing that.

01:34:10.895 --> 01:34:12.813
The young lady who just
approached the bench...

01:34:12.897 --> 01:34:15.649
presented me with this
Christmas card and this.

01:34:15.734 --> 01:34:17.860
It's a one-dollar bill.

01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:20.195
It's gonna be returned
to her shortly.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.990
But by presenting me
with this bill,

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:27.953
she reminded me of the fact
that it's issued by the Treasury
of the United States of America,

01:34:28.038 --> 01:34:32.499
and it's backed
by the government
and the people...

01:34:32.584 --> 01:34:35.544
of the United States of America.

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:42.384
Upon inspection of the article,
you will see the words
"In God We Trust."

01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:46.221
Now, we're not here
to prove that God exists,

01:34:46.306 --> 01:34:49.391
but we are here to prove that
a being just as invisible...

01:34:49.476 --> 01:34:54.146
and yet just as present... exists.

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:56.190
The federal government
puts its trust in God.

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:58.192
It does so on faith
and faith alone.

01:34:58.276 --> 01:35:01.320
It's the will of the people
that guides the government.

01:35:01.404 --> 01:35:05.699
And it is and was
their collective faith
in a greater being...

01:35:05.784 --> 01:35:08.911
that gave and gives cause
to the inscription on this bill.

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:12.664
If the government
of the United States
can issue its currency...

01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:18.170
bearing a declaration of trust
in God without demanding
physical evidence...

01:35:18.254 --> 01:35:22.341
of the existence
or the nonexistence
of a greater being,

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:25.511
then the state of New York,

01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:30.766
by a similar demonstration
of the collective faith of its people,

01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:35.729
can accept and acknowledge
that Santa Claus does exist,

01:35:35.814 --> 01:35:38.524
and he exists in the person
of Kriss Kringle!

01:35:44.823 --> 01:35:48.242
Case dismissed.

01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:53.038
Case dismissed!

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:56.208
Santa Claus wins!

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:10.222
All charges have been dropped.
Kriss Kringle is free.

01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:13.851
- Hey! How about that?
- Yes!

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:22.276
You're right, Kriss.
It's all about the children.

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.989
Congratulations, Counselor.
Thank you.

01:36:27.073 --> 01:36:30.409
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Kringle.
- Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Collins.

01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:33.829
Thank you.

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:37.875
Uh, my children...
wanted me to remind you...

01:36:37.959 --> 01:36:40.085
not to forget to stop by
the house tonight.

01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:43.172
- Oh, I won't forget. I promise.
- We live in Stamford.

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:46.258
3133 Brompton Road.
Big white house.

01:36:46.342 --> 01:36:49.178
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I know it well.

01:36:49.262 --> 01:36:52.764
Yeah, well—
Anyway, merry Christmas.

01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.975
Oh, uh, Mr. Collins,

01:36:55.059 --> 01:36:58.979
I hope you've taken down
that old television antenna.

01:36:59.063 --> 01:37:01.899
I ripped my pants on it last year.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:10.574
Pardon me, folks.
Pardon me.

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:15.162
Well, Kriss, you're free.
You made a believer
out of everybody.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:19.291
Oh, not everybody.
There's still a few
I have to convince.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.418
One in particular.

01:37:21.503 --> 01:37:23.462
Excuse me.

01:37:23.588 --> 01:37:25.756
- Way to go, Bryan!
- I'm so happy for you.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:27.966
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Walker.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:31.345
- You did a great job, sweetie.
- You kicked that guys's bottom.

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:37.100
- Well, she saved the day.
- Well—

01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:42.648
Congratulations, Bryan.

01:37:42.732 --> 01:37:44.650
Thank you, Dorey.

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:52.533
Have a merry Christmas.

01:37:52.617 --> 01:37:54.535
You too.

01:37:58.081 --> 01:37:59.998
Well, I'll let you go.

01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:02.459
Merry Christmas.

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:06.004
- And good luck.
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Walker.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:11.260
And a merry Christmas
to you, young lady,
and thank you very much.

01:38:11.344 --> 01:38:14.680
Merry Christmas, Mr. Kringle.
Merry Christmas, Bryan.

01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:21.520
Excuse me.

01:38:31.114 --> 01:38:34.741
[Kriss] Again, thank you so much.

01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:36.743
I shall never forget you.

01:38:36.828 --> 01:38:39.371
And in all my travels past...

01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:43.083
and all my travels
yet to come,

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:45.294
I'll never find
a better friend.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:50.841
Thank you, Kriss.

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:52.843
Merry Christmas.

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:59.182
Merry Christmas to you, Bryan.

01:39:03.521 --> 01:39:05.355
Hey, you wanna
share a cab home?

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:10.611
Home? Not tonight.

01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:12.613
I'm going to be somewhat busy.

01:39:14.699 --> 01:39:16.658
That's right.

01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:35.761
This is gonna blow up
in my face, isn't it?

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:41.391
I lost bigger than
I ever thought I'd win.

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:45.479
There was a lot of pressure, sir.
I mean, who knew
what the judge was gonna do...

01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:49.483
when he was faced with having
to put Santa Claus in the nuthouse?

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:51.485
He isn't Santa Claus.

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:53.737
What the hell is the matter
with everybody?

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.864
There is no Santa Claus!

01:43:12.937 --> 01:43:15.814
Is somebody getting married?

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:18.942
- Not that I know of.
- Oh.

01:43:20.862 --> 01:43:23.154
Did you arrange this?

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:26.658
No. You did.

01:43:26.742 --> 01:43:29.411
- Oh- I did?
- You didn't?

01:43:29.495 --> 01:43:31.454
- I didn't. Did you?
- I didn't.

01:43:31.539 --> 01:43:33.707
- You did. I know you did.
- Oh, no.

01:43:33.833 --> 01:43:36.334
- [Dorey] Yes, you did. You did, didn't you?
- No, no.

01:43:36.419 --> 01:43:39.796
I did not. Father?

01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.634
Are you ready?

01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:47.596
For what?

01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:50.473
To get married.

01:45:07.051 --> 01:45:09.552
Oh, my gosh!

01:45:10.596 --> 01:45:13.223
I have something
to tell you.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.520
What'd you get for Christmas?

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.513
I don't care what you
asked Mr. Kringle for.

01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:56.099
Susan, that is not why
we are going to the house.

01:45:56.183 --> 01:45:58.351
We're going to
the catalog house, right?

01:45:58.436 --> 01:46:00.687
That's the house
I told him I wanted.

01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:03.064
I showed him a picture of it,
and he took it,

01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:05.316
and he said he would
get it for me.

01:46:05.443 --> 01:46:08.820
- Well, a house is a pretty big gift.
- That's what Mr. Kringle said.

01:46:08.904 --> 01:46:12.282
Honey, we are going to the
house because it snowed,

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:15.035
and it's very pretty,

01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:17.662
and because Mr. Shellhammer
wants to take photographs...

01:46:17.747 --> 01:46:19.831
for next year's Christmas catalog,

01:46:19.915 --> 01:46:22.751
which, I think,
is awfully bold of him.

01:46:22.835 --> 01:46:25.712
- It is a holiday.
- That’s just an excuse.

01:46:25.796 --> 01:46:28.131
Mr. Kringle did all this.

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:30.133
I'm very sorry, Mother.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:32.677
You have it perfectly wrong.

01:47:01.665 --> 01:47:03.625
I knew it!

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.978
- Well, where is everybody?
- You got a bonus.

01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:28.358
- What do you mean?
- Our name's on the mailbox.

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:30.735
I got a call last night
from Mr. Kringle who said...

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:33.154
you and your husband
were looking for a house.

01:47:33.239 --> 01:47:35.490
He was quite insistent.

01:47:37.243 --> 01:47:39.119
Did you get married?

01:47:39.245 --> 01:47:42.497
- Yeah, last night.
- I can't believe it.

01:47:42.581 --> 01:47:45.667
Congratulations.
Was this planned?

01:47:46.919 --> 01:47:50.004
- Uh, no.
- I can't believe it!

01:47:50.089 --> 01:47:55.385
Mr. Kringle wanted to be here,
but, uh, he's overseas.

01:47:57.555 --> 01:47:59.472
Mr. Kringle.

01:47:59.557 --> 01:48:03.101
[Shellhammer] Oh, the house is for sale,
fully furnished,

01:48:03.185 --> 01:48:05.395
and I'm sure you
can afford it now.

01:48:05.479 --> 01:48:10.400
Oh, we all get our bonuses
thanks to you and, uh, Mr. Kringle.

01:48:14.363 --> 01:48:16.281
Wow!

01:48:29.753 --> 01:48:31.588
I knew it.

01:48:31.714 --> 01:48:35.049
Oh, thank you, Donald.

01:48:35.134 --> 01:48:38.428
I don't know what to say except...
merry Christmas.

01:48:38.512 --> 01:48:42.473
Merry Christmas. Oh.
Chin-chin.

01:48:51.150 --> 01:48:54.194
This is the house I asked Kriss for,
and he got it for me.

01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:56.237
And he got me a dad.

01:48:56.322 --> 01:48:58.489
And the third thing—

01:48:58.574 --> 01:49:01.492
I guess I'll just
have to wait for.

01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:04.746
But he'll get it for me,
won't he?

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:08.958
If Kriss said he'd get you something,
I bet it's already on the way.

01:49:10.252 --> 01:49:13.004
I guess there's no doubt about it.
He's real.

01:49:14.590 --> 01:49:16.966
I'm going up to look at
my new room. Excuse me.

01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:25.850
- Susan?
- What?

01:49:25.935 --> 01:49:29.979
What else did you ask
Mr. Kringle for?

01:49:30.064 --> 01:49:32.148
A baby brother.

01:49:32.233 --> 01:49:34.150
