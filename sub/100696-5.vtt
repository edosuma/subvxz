better than me and you?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.574
-Nobody.
-Could eat off it too.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.160
We could do that shit together.
Yeah, we could build off that.

17:58.243 --> 18:01.205
I know you got the plug, the connect.
So you got a gangsta with a wig on,

18:01.288 --> 18:04.124
that eliminates the whole stigma
of toxic masculinity

18:04.208 --> 18:05.709
in the African-American community.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.670
-They eat that shit up in Hollywood.
-Hold on, hold on, dawg.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.506
So, you want to do a comedy

18:10.798 --> 18:12.257
-about a Crip dude...
-Right.

18:12.341 --> 18:13.842
-...from the '60s...
-Okay.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.971
...that pretends to be a female Blood
from Inglewood Family?

18:18.055 --> 18:20.349
-No, from Compton Piru.
-Right.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.937
Yup. And the only reason he get in,
pull up on the enemy and you hear,

18:25.020 --> 18:27.815
"Pow! Pow! Pow!" Let loose in that bitch.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.234
So it's a plan to,
like, infiltrate from within.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.152
-Precisely, cuz.
-Got it.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.656
It's like <i>Deep Cover</i> meets <i>Juwanna Mann.</i>

18:36.115 --> 18:37.241
Right. Of course.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.576
Hold on, did you like <i>Juwanna Mann?</i>

18:39.660 --> 18:40.536
Hell, yeah.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.205
This nigga wanted so passionately
to be in the NBA

18:43.288 --> 18:44.414
that he put on a wig and--

18:44.498 --> 18:46.959
I understand the conceit of <i>Juwanna Mann.</i>

18:47.042 --> 18:47.876
I get it.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.420
-So you know why that shit hard.
-No.

18:50.879 --> 18:54.466
Nigga, it's your classic comedy
about a man putting on a wig.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.136
<i>Tootsie.</i>

18:57.219 --> 18:58.303
<i>Some Like It Hot.</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:01.598
Nigga, <i>Mrs. Doubtfire.</i>
Rest in peace, Robin Williams.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.476
Dawg, those are fucking classics.
Like, bangers.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.936
Why? 'Cause they white?

19:06.937 --> 19:09.606
Them shits ain't nothing
but white <i>Juwanna Manns.</i>

19:12.151 --> 19:13.068
Damn.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.737
Hmm. I fucked you up with that one, huh?

19:16.530 --> 19:17.573
A little bit.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.325
Yep, that's what I do, cuz.
I told you my shit hard.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.619
So how should I proceed?
How should I move forward?

19:22.703 --> 19:23.537
What? Proceed?

19:23.620 --> 19:25.664
So we can move forward
with the whole process.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.167
A nigga like you, you probably got
a white boy on the payroll.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.960
Who the white nigga I gotta email?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.920
-Email Danny.
-Danny.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.130
You got a laptop?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.257
I can go to the library.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.550
Nigga, I'm hungry!

19:37.134 --> 19:38.218
I'm willing to do anything.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.846
Nigga, I'll put this shit on a pigeon
and fly that bitch to Danny.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.514
I'm ready to work, cuz.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.557
-You hear me?
-All right.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.143
-I'll handwrite the nigga.
-Email me.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.061
I'mma email-- I'mma email Danny!

19:48.145 --> 19:51.356
-White <i>Juwanna Mann.</i>
-White <i>Juwanna Mann. </i>Gangster shit.

19:51.565 --> 19:55.068
Nigga, I'mma pull up in the Oscars
with a motherfuckin' track suit on, nigga.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.404
I wanna thank the homies, the whole set.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.575
Yeah, family, he ain't about to be
the only nigga in here making money!

20:01.825 --> 20:03.702
I'mma put on all y'all lil' niggas.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.330
Old motherfuckers too

20:57.339 --> 20:59.132
You know,
I don't mean to be disrespectful,

20:59.216 --> 21:00.926
by eating all your food, man.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.178
And, you know, looking at your wife.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.930
<i>-</i>What?
-[Ray chuckles] Yeah, man.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.182
[Kenya] What are you talking about?
Why you looking at my wife?

21:07.266 --> 21:10.310
I mean, but no disrespect,
but you are acting a little white lately.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.520
[Kenya] What?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.272
-Yeah. I gotta say that.
-[coughing, laughing]

21:13.355 --> 21:15.148
-Don't do that, Dad. That's not cool.
-[Ray] Real mayonnaise.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.943
Acting like one of them white newscasters
that be on Channel 6.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.069
-[laughter]
-I'm acting white

21:19.152 --> 21:21.029
because I feel like a good movie

21:21.113 --> 21:23.323
shouldn't get the same review
as a bad movie?

21:23.824 --> 21:26.159
You know what I'm saying,
like, I literally saw [bleep]

21:26.243 --> 21:29.079
get six points higher than <i>Titanic,</i>

21:29.246 --> 21:30.956
which is obviously the better movie.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.582
-Better to who?
-[Kenya] What?

21:33.000 --> 21:33.875
Who's it better to?

21:33.959 --> 21:35.502
-What do you mean?
-Who gives a fuck about <i>Titanic?</i>

21:35.585 --> 21:37.754
<i>Titanic</i> wasn't nothing
but <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

21:37.838 --> 21:40.173
-on a nasty-ass boat that sank.
-[Grandpa] Straight up.

21:40.257 --> 21:42.384
Unc, I was saying that same shit
about <i>Juwanna Mann.</i>

21:42.467 --> 21:44.386
-Oh, my God.
-Man, I love that <i>Juwanna Mann.</i>

21:44.469 --> 21:45.804
-You do?
-I saw it again last week.

21:45.887 --> 21:47.639
-That shit hard.
-I'm telling you.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.058
All <i>Juwanna Mann</i> is... is <i>Tootsie.</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:51.143
[Ray laughing] 

21:51.226 --> 21:52.394
-[Harold] Exactly.
<i>-Tootsie!</i>

21:52.477 --> 21:55.188
That brother should have been
the next Brad Pitt. I'm telling you.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.648
What is happening right now?

21:56.732 --> 21:59.609
He played a woman and a man
at the same time. And was hooping!

-That brother is talented.
-[Ray] That's right!

if it entertains you and you like it,

22:03.947 --> 22:05.240
fuck it! You like it!

22:05.324 --> 22:07.617
Don't tell me what I should like
when I like what I like.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.037
-Come on!
-Fucking bum fights are entertaining.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.164
You wanna sit up
and watch bum fights all day?

22:12.247 --> 22:14.166
I like to see two dusty motherfuckers...

22:14.249 --> 22:17.627
I'd rather watch a bum fight
than that goddamn, what, <i>Citizen Kane!</i>

22:17.711 --> 22:19.629
You'd rather watch bum fights
than <i>Citizen Kane?</i>

22:19.713 --> 22:21.256
-Yeah.
-What the fuck is<i> Citizen Kane?</i>

22:21.673 --> 22:23.633
-What is <i>Citizen Kane?</i>
-I ain't never heard of that shit.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.552
I shouldn't be having this conversation
with you guys.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.596
<i>Citizen Kane </i>is, is, is, is

22:27.679 --> 22:29.639
when some citizens is doing cocaine.

-Come on!
-Yeah, change Rosebud to Snowflake, we in.

Hey!

22:35.145 --> 22:37.606
Now that's a movie I will watch.
<i>Citizen Cocaine.</i>

22:37.689 --> 22:39.816
-Why would you watch that?
-[Harold] More real than <i>Citizen Kane.</i>

22:39.900 --> 22:43.111
While you're doing this,
you need to go do this.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.821
-What, I got some shit?
-[Kenya] Yes!

22:44.905 --> 22:45.906
There's kids. You should've--

22:45.989 --> 22:48.158
There's kids out here.
Y'all let me walk around like this?

22:48.742 --> 22:50.452
-That's <i>Citizen 'Caine.</i>
-[Harold] Yeah, well...

22:50.827 --> 22:52.329
[Nadine laughing] So, why--

22:52.454 --> 22:54.831
Why you ain't done nothing
with that Tyler Perry?  

22:54.915 --> 22:56.792
-Yeah.
-Um...

22:57.250 --> 22:59.628
We-- we might. We might do something.

22:59.711 --> 23:03.840
Oh, wait. Did you see that--
that funeral movie he did?

23:03.924 --> 23:05.467
-Ah!
-Yes!

23:05.550 --> 23:06.718
That was so funny!

23:07.302 --> 23:09.888
Me and your pops saw that thing
and we was screaming the whole time.

23:09.971 --> 23:10.847
[laughing]

23:10.931 --> 23:13.183
You sure it was the movie
making him scream?

23:13.266 --> 23:15.435
-[Nadine laughing]
-I'm going to the bathroom.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.854
Oh, why? You feeling itchy?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.106
Huh?

23:19.981 --> 23:22.609
What's wrong with y'all?
Why y'all so mean to that lady?

23:22.692 --> 23:24.861
What do you expect me to do?
Child's 12 years old.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.322
-I gotta ask y'all a question.
-[Nadine] What?

23:27.406 --> 23:29.324
You saw those Tyler Perry movies.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.326
Did you see <i>Green Book?</i>

23:33.662 --> 23:35.247
<i>-Green Book?</i>
<i>-Green Book.</i>

23:35.956 --> 23:37.791

23:38.834 --> 23:40.836
The Academy Award for best picture?

23:41.044 --> 23:43.922
-Who-- who was in it?
-I don't know nothing about <i>Green Book.</i>

23:44.005 --> 23:46.466
Can we get it at the Redbox?
I'll look at it.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.843
-We'll look at it.
-Yeah.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.095
I don't know nothing
about no book. A green book?

23:50.178 --> 23:52.556
I'll watch anything you want me to watch.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.558
Yeah, we'll watch it. Is it good?

23:54.641 --> 23:56.852
Why did I make my family watch [bleep]
that day?

23:58.854 --> 24:01.148
<i>Because I know the one thing they'll do</i>

24:01.231 --> 24:04.443
<i>that Hollywood won't do</i>
<i>is keep it completely real with me.</i>

24:05.026 --> 24:07.487
There's no way in hell
they're gonna like that shit. None.<i> </i>

24:07.571 --> 24:08.405
Trust me.

24:08.488 --> 24:09.406

24:09.489 --> 24:12.617
Oh, my God! Wasn't that good? Wasn't that?

24:13.034 --> 24:15.620
That is the best film
my son has ever made.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.372
That was so good!

24:17.456 --> 24:19.791
[all talking excitedly]

24:23.086 --> 24:25.130
I did not see that coming.

24:25.964 --> 24:29.509
Dad, the last movie these people
probably paid to see was <i>Uncle Drew.</i>

24:29.593 --> 24:31.720
Here's the thing, though, Dre Dre. Like...

24:32.095 --> 24:34.973
sometimes, you got to just listen
to the public, hear the people.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.518
You can't always be that quirky, indie,
intellectual girl

24:38.602 --> 24:40.145
who looks down on everybody.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.981
Dad, that movie was not good.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.983
Who are we to decide what's good?

24:45.066 --> 24:46.902
What, you're quoting Uncle Ray now?

24:47.569 --> 24:48.820
I think I gotta do that panel.

24:49.905 --> 24:50.739
I do.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.033
I think I got to do it.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.078
Okay, thoughts.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.832
I loved it.
I mean, serious, it was crazy.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.667
The one car was like... [imitates car] 

25:02.751 --> 25:04.503
and the other one was like...
[imitates car]

25:04.586 --> 25:06.505
Man, I've never seen no shit
like that before.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.089
What did you guys think?

25:08.173 --> 25:10.008
I thought
it was really interesting, honestly.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.344
Like, super professionally cast.

25:12.969 --> 25:14.513
-[Leeza] Yeah.
-Like paid actors? Yeah.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.097
[Jerome]
Well, yeah! They were really good.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.975
They look like they showed up on time.
They knew their lines.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.436
-The lead actress was beautiful.
-[Nelson] Yeah.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.688
-I mean, really pretty.
-The lead actress was beautiful?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.357
Yes, that happens often.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.942
Another thing I noticed is that
a lot of times

25:27.025 --> 25:28.777
they use a small font for the credits,

25:28.860 --> 25:30.862
but these guys used a huge font,
and I loved that.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.574
What the fuck-- what is going on, dude?
What did you guys think about the movie?

25:34.658 --> 25:35.992
Did you like it or not?

25:37.160 --> 25:39.371
-[Nelson] Um...
-[Leeza] Well, there was... [groans]

25:39.496 --> 25:41.248
See, this is the problem right here, dude.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.125
Dude, why are you afraid to be honest?

25:44.209 --> 25:47.879
I think maybe it has something to do
with the environment you've created.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.756
What? You always--

25:49.923 --> 25:52.592
Look, this is a black movie, man.
And you're black.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.510
[Kenya] Yeah, I am.

25:53.593 --> 25:54.844
This could easily be a set up.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.721
-You're telling me this is not a set up?
-[Kenya] What?

25:56.805 --> 25:58.223
-So is that what this is about?
-[Jerome] Little bit.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.809
You're afraid to talk shit
because this is a black movie?

26:00.892 --> 26:05.313
I don't think I want to hear them
talk shit about a black movie.

26:05.564 --> 26:06.606
Okay.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.024
-That's true.
-[Jerome] That's fair.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.944
Mikayla, you and I need to hang out more.
You smoke?

26:12.487 --> 26:14.489
Mikayla's throwing it at me, right?

26:14.656 --> 26:16.157
I mean, I'm not crazy, right?

26:16.741 --> 26:20.078
[Drea] Um... I'll keep an eye out for it.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.454
Bet.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.206
[chuckles]

26:23.290 --> 26:24.708
Guys, seriously.

26:25.166 --> 26:28.962
One time, complete pass,
no repercussions.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.630
Just be honest,

26:30.714 --> 26:32.716
what the fuck did you think
about the movie?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.426
[Jerome exhales] Who's going first?

26:34.509 --> 26:35.802
-I'm going to do it.
-Now talking.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.178
Of course you are, right?

26:37.262 --> 26:39.347
I did not like it.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.515
I wanted to walk out,

26:40.599 --> 26:42.559
but then I remembered that I was at work.
So I couldn't.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.060
-Okay.
-[Jerome] It's terrible!

26:44.144 --> 26:45.937
The whole conceit is just flawed.

26:46.021 --> 26:49.065
I don't understand why [bleep]
even brought [bleep] into this.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.900
-That was crazy, right?
-It made no sense!

26:50.984 --> 26:54.362
It made no sense. Because the movie
was a fucking train wreck.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.864
It was a train wreck,

26:55.947 --> 26:58.700
and, you know,
it was black this and black that,

26:58.783 --> 27:00.910
and I was like,
"Is that supposed to be impressive?"

27:00.994 --> 27:02.996
I've never seen you speak so passionately.

27:03.079 --> 27:04.956
Or wave your head like that. What's that?

27:05.040 --> 27:06.291
What? I... Hey.

27:06.374 --> 27:08.585
Where was that
when I asked the first time?

27:08.668 --> 27:11.713
-Why weren't you just honest?
-I don't know, we're not crazy people.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.757
Like, we can't say that to you, you know?

27:13.840 --> 27:16.259
I'm not black.
I can't speak to the black experience,

27:16.343 --> 27:20.221
but I was pretty sure in that movie,
like, right away, it shit the bed.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.058
And it wasn't that professionally cast.
There were mistakes.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.393
But what about-- The driving was dope.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.687
Come on! That's your thing?

27:27.979 --> 27:30.065
-Black people can drive fast?
-Drop it. 

27:30.148 --> 27:32.692
So is that it?
Are we saying this is what's happening?

27:32.776 --> 27:35.570
That the critics are white guys like you

27:35.654 --> 27:38.865
and they're afraid to say anything
because they think if they say something,

27:38.948 --> 27:40.909
it'll be like, "We're speaking bad
against a black movie."

27:40.992 --> 27:42.744
So they say, "It's great.
It was amazing."

27:42.827 --> 27:45.955
Yes, exactly.
That's exactly what's happening.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.041
No, look,
I think it's all these movements too.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.542
The #metoo, the #timesup.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.419
-#OscarsSoWhite.
-[Nelson] Yeah.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.255
It's the times we're in, all right.
Everybody's on eggshells.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.841
You can't say anything
about anything ever, you know?

27:56.925 --> 27:58.510
In fact, I shouldn't' even said
what I just said.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.303
Emily, do not write that down.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.889
Where was all this
when fucking <i>New Jack City </i>was going on?

28:02.972 --> 28:04.474
-[Nelson] Right?
-Where was its 99?

28:04.557 --> 28:06.101
'Cause it definitely fucking deserved it.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.560
Okay. Let me just say this.

28:08.269 --> 28:10.188
Is it such a bad thing?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.483
This wave of black film and TV?
Like, does it matter

28:13.566 --> 28:15.402
what scores they get,
as long as they're getting made?

28:15.485 --> 28:18.154
But isn't there a better black filmmaker

28:18.238 --> 28:20.657
that needed their movie to get made
but that movie got made?

28:20.740 --> 28:22.826
-And his film can be made too.
-[Jerome] Sure.

28:22.909 --> 28:26.329
Is there, like, a freedom in,
like, being allowed to make bad movies?

28:26.413 --> 28:27.872
That's what King fought for.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.666
The freedom to make bad movies?

28:29.749 --> 28:30.625
Yes.

28:31.835 --> 28:32.961
[Drea] You look torn.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.922
I am. Fucking torn.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.383
I thought you said you got it wrong
with this one, though.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.637
Dude, you don't have to be that dude
right now. Seriously.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.098
Can you just please tell me
what you think I should do?

28:46.224 --> 28:49.269
Well, unlike you,
I would have been honest from the jump

28:49.352 --> 28:52.188
and said, "This movie is garbage,
and I cannot endorse it

28:52.272 --> 28:54.858
because I'm not
in the garbage-endorsing business."

28:56.109 --> 28:58.653
The world's going to kick you in your jaw.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.866
Seriously, just jump up
and just roundhouse you.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.325
You'll see.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.619
[Drea]<i> My dad was obviously</i>
<i>in the weeds on this</i>

29:06.703 --> 29:09.914
<i>and looking for more clarity</i>
<i>on white critics and black cinema.</i>

29:09.998 --> 29:14.085
<i>So we went to New York to track down</i>
<i>a pretty reliable source on the matter.</i>

29:14.169 --> 29:16.838
-Yo, this room is fucking dumb, dude.
-I know. 

29:17.797 --> 29:21.176
This size in Manhattan?
You think this is on Expedia?

29:21.760 --> 29:24.262
[Tyler] Uh, I don't think so.
How you doing, man?

29:24.345 --> 29:26.139
-[chuckling] Oh!
-Yeah, this is expensive. How you doing?

29:26.222 --> 29:27.682
Oh my God. It's Tyler Perry.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.726
-What's up man? Good to see you.
-What's up? How are you?

29:29.809 --> 29:31.686
-How are you? Hi, Drea, how are you?
-Hi.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.438
-Good, how are you?
-Good.

29:33.521 --> 29:34.856
-Good to meet you.
-[laughing]

29:34.939 --> 29:38.860
Yo, you are a big motherfucker, man.
Do people know you're this tall?

29:39.527 --> 29:41.946
I'm not sure, but do people know
that you speak this way

29:42.030 --> 29:44.073
in front of your daughter,
using that language?

29:44.365 --> 29:48.578
No, it-- it's cool, man. It's just,
you know, you're-- you're cool, right?

29:48.661 --> 29:50.413
-Yeah, it's cool.
-Are you really?

29:51.372 --> 29:54.042
No. Not really,
but what am I gonna say? He's my father.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.796
What are you talking about, dude?
You curse at me all the time, dude.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.256
You told me to go fuck myself
on the cab ride over here.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.927
Yeah, because you told me you and Mom
were thinking about aborting me.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.179
-Kenya.
-No, I didn't say that.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.890
I said me and your mom
visited a few abortion clinics

30:08.973 --> 30:11.142
while we were pregnant,
but it worked out.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.354
Wow. I am never raising my kid in LA.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.773
That is crazy,
y'all talk to each other like that.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.775
-Wow.
-No-- This is my baby.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.945
It's kinda our thing.
We have a special relationship. It's...

30:22.028 --> 30:25.323
Yes. One that's totally devoid of respect.
I get it.

30:25.740 --> 30:27.450
Hey, I gonna talk to your dad.
Help yourself.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.077
There's some great stuff over there.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.162
Okay, come on. come on. Let's talk.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.249
Do you mind?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.752
-That's from over there?
-Yeah.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.046
Yeah, I kind of do.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.966
-Really?
-Why you looking around the room?

30:43.049 --> 30:45.426
Really, yeah. Them motherfucking chips
are $35 a bag!

30:45.510 --> 30:46.427
-What?
-Yes.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.179
What kind of potatoes are damn $35?

30:48.263 --> 30:50.223
I need to go to Idaho
and find that fucking potato.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.850
-I kinda already opened it.
-Just...

30:51.975 --> 30:54.310
Go ahead, Kenya.
What's going on, man? Tell me.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.728
I mean...

30:56.229 --> 30:59.357
I feel like you have figured out
the beat of your own drum

30:59.732 --> 31:02.318
and that's what you dance to,
and it works for you

31:02.402 --> 31:03.862
and you don't seem like you care.

31:04.112 --> 31:04.946
I don't.

31:05.321 --> 31:07.073
I don't know how to do it, man.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.158
I feel like I really care
what white people think.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.660
I think I care, like, a lot.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.370
I care what everybody thinks.

31:12.453 --> 31:15.874
To be honest with you, I feel like that's
almost all I care about, it seems like.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.292
What other people think.

31:17.750 --> 31:21.212
That's really sad, man.
It's a sad existence.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.131
It's not-- It's not a great life.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.508
It seems like every time I do a project,

31:25.592 --> 31:28.469
the first thing I do after the project
comes out is go to Rotten Tomatoes.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.680
Let me tell you about them tomatoes.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.266
-I don't fuck with them.
-With tomatoes?

31:33.349 --> 31:35.602
I don't give a damn about it,
rotten or fresh.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.020
None of that means shit to me.

31:38.646 --> 31:41.274
[stuttering] That's amazing.
What about critics?

31:41.566 --> 31:44.110
I don't give a fuck.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.404
I guess... that's amazing.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.239
Can I just tell you why?
Let me tell you why.

31:48.323 --> 31:49.824
-Please.
-Because-- Listen, man.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.619
I know that I'm telling stories
that my folks want to see.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.078
I'm talking from our point of view,

31:54.162 --> 31:56.873
we're speaking a language,
we're speaking a shorthand that we get

31:56.956 --> 31:58.917
that white people don't necessarily get.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.461
Nina Simone said this
and I never forgot it. She said,

32:01.544 --> 32:03.296
"You will use up everything you got

32:03.379 --> 32:05.256
trying to give everybody what they want."

32:05.632 --> 32:06.925
You got to focus, man.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.052
You know what I do?
I super-serve my niche.

32:09.135 --> 32:12.055
We speak a language. We're talking.
We know each other. We get it.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.891
There's a lot of times I see shit
that win Oscars and I be like,

32:14.974 --> 32:17.936
"What is this shit?" I walked out
halfway through it. I don't get it.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.688
And listen, I feel like they feel
the same way about my work.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.899
They don't get it, which is all cool.

32:23.107 --> 32:23.983
My mother,

32:24.484 --> 32:26.569
born in Jim Crow south in Louisiana,

32:26.653 --> 32:29.113
down the street from Mississippi
where Emmett Till was murdered.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.033
She told me the value of being who I am,
of my blackness.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.661
She said, "Don't you ever let anybody
tell you who you are.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.996
You know who you are,
you know where you come from."

32:37.080 --> 32:40.208
I watched her stories, her struggles,
and that's what I'm telling.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.086
I'm telling the stories that I come from,
and that's why they're winning,

32:43.169 --> 32:45.755
because people are recognizing
themselves in these stories.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.799
No matter how crass people think they are,

32:47.882 --> 32:50.176
no matter what the critics say,
"Oh, I don't get this shit.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.260
I don't understand what it is."

32:51.344 --> 32:54.055
I don't give a fuck
because I'm talking to us.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.849
That's why millions of people
are watching my shows every week,

32:56.933 --> 32:59.519
that's why people keep showing up
and sending the movies to number one.

32:59.602 --> 33:02.063
I'm talking to us, connecting with us.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.941
You know what I'm saying?
Let me tell you what you're doing.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.777
Trying to get them to approve you.
That's what I don't get.

33:07.860 --> 33:09.821
Why are niggas running around
to get white folks...

33:09.904 --> 33:12.031
"Please tell me I'm special.
Oh, give me your Oscar.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.283
Let me know I'm all these things
that you want me to be."

33:14.367 --> 33:16.119
Fuck that. Tell your story,

33:16.202 --> 33:18.371
live in your own life
and your own culture.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.789
Tell your own experience.

33:20.039 --> 33:21.958
Can't nobody tell you how to be you.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.876
You hear what I'm saying?

33:25.086 --> 33:26.462
-I do, man.
-[Tyler] Good.

33:26.546 --> 33:29.298
-I really-- really fucking do.
-Good.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.676
Thanks, Tyler Perry.

33:31.968 --> 33:33.678
You're welcome, Kenya Barris.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.431
-We doing government names?
-I just felt like it was a special moment.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.932
Yeah. All right.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.142
-[crunching]
-You done?

33:39.225 --> 33:42.186
God, these chips
are phenomenal, dog. Seriously.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.771
I guess I'll never know.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.443
Yo, have you seen [bleep] yet?

33:50.653 --> 33:53.489
Yo, is your assistant on the line?
Can-- can she clear the line?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.034
Thanks, Alex.

33:56.784 --> 34:01.164
Yo, between me and you,
that shit is trash, dawg.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.374
Like trash-trash.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.751
Is it my fault?

34:05.126 --> 34:07.962
Okay, everything's your fault,
so you're gonna have to be more specific.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.466
-Is it my fault that they can't dance?
-Oh, of course it's your fault.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.884
You're the whitest person I know.

34:12.967 --> 34:15.053
What? Don't--
You're the whitest person I know.

34:15.178 --> 34:18.181
-That's such a white clapback.
-You're a white clapback.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.434
-Great. That was-- Wow.
-That was not good, I know. I know.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.062
-Hey.
-Let me call you right back, dawg.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.899
Do you think it's my fault
that the kids can't dance?

34:28.191 --> 34:30.276
I don't have any time
for this right now, babe.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.402
Why? What's going on?

34:31.486 --> 34:32.487
[Kenya sighs]

34:32.570 --> 34:35.114
This panel shit's got me fucked up, man.

34:35.198 --> 34:37.116
-Why?
-Because,

34:37.366 --> 34:39.786
first I was gonna do it,
then I wasn't gonna do it,

34:39.869 --> 34:41.829
but now I'm thinking maybe I should do it.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.041
You need to stop messing around
and just do that goddamn panel.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.211
What? This is serious.
Why you playing around? This is serious.

34:48.294 --> 34:52.298
You know what's serious? That your house
has a crack in its foundation.

34:52.381 --> 34:54.550
-That's serious.
-Cracks are bad.

34:54.634 --> 34:55.802
We have a huge crack,

34:55.885 --> 34:59.555
and you are riding that wave right now
just like [bleep].

34:59.639 --> 35:02.433
-So, I suggest you play the game.
-What?

35:02.517 --> 35:05.770
You go to the panel,
you do all the things to keep it up

35:05.853 --> 35:10.441
because I want to make sure
that this beautiful, overpriced home

35:10.525 --> 35:13.361
doesn't deteriorate,
which could kind of happen any day.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.198
You think I'm riding
some kind of black wave?

35:17.782 --> 35:18.991
Yeah, it's a good thing.

35:19.075 --> 35:20.952
-No, it's not!
-We should be celebrating.

35:21.035 --> 35:23.955
Jesus Christ, dude.
Is nobody keeping it real with me?

35:24.455 --> 35:27.667
Like, is everybody just thinking
I'm on this wave too?

35:28.042 --> 35:29.836
Am I trash and nobody will tell--

35:30.628 --> 35:32.547
Do you think I'm trash?

35:32.630 --> 35:34.340
What? No! No.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.926
As a black woman, which I am,

35:37.301 --> 35:39.804
I support everything

What do you mean, what is that?

35:48.479 --> 35:50.064
-What is--
-#supporteverythingblack.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.607
-It's a thing.
-It's not a thing.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.276
-Chlo.
-What?

35:53.359 --> 35:55.945
-#supporteverythingblack?
-It's definitely a thing.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.656
I feel like she's been stealing
money out of my wallet.

35:58.739 --> 36:01.242
She might have been,
but she knows what's up culturally.

36:01.993 --> 36:02.827
Dude.

36:04.078 --> 36:04.912
I'm trash.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.624
["I Want To Know What Love Is"

36:08.749 --> 36:11.294
It's one thing for white critics
to be scared of me,

36:11.502 --> 36:13.671
but it's a completely 'nother
for my people

36:13.754 --> 36:16.090
to only mess with me
because they feel like they have to.

36:17.216 --> 36:20.845
Last five years of my life,
I've pretty much killed myself.

Why does it matter?

36:37.612 --> 36:38.696
Why does it matter?

36:39.405 --> 36:41.574
Babe, as a writer, it's all that matters.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.993
You're constantly wondering
if you're a fraud,

36:44.076 --> 36:46.621
or if you're just running around
fooling everybody.

36:46.704 --> 36:49.040
So what,
you think you're fooling everyone?

36:49.123 --> 36:51.417
No. I don't know.

36:52.877 --> 36:53.711
Maybe.

-I just know we got to fix this.
-Fix what?

36:57.673 --> 36:59.800
The system. It's broken.

Or maybe we can figure out
some kind of high council that

37:03.721 --> 37:07.058
makes informed and educated decisions
on everything black.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.852
-A high council?
-I don't know what I'm saying.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.563
Maybe I sound crazy,
but we gotta figure out some way

37:12.647 --> 37:14.857

We have to.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.171
Thank you guys all so much, seriously,
for hopping on this call.

37:44.470 --> 37:45.388
Um...

37:46.097 --> 37:48.641
Okay, I mean, I tried you 12 times
before I got a call back.

37:48.724 --> 37:50.893
<i>I actually can't believe</i>

<i>It's an incredibly talented</i>
<i>group of people.</i>

37:53.145 --> 37:55.231
<i>It kinda feels like history in the making.</i>

37:55.314 --> 37:58.150
Okay, I don't know why everything
has to be about history with you, Ava.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.236
I think you're gonna actually
see this call

38:00.319 --> 38:02.738
is much less historical
than you think it's gonna be.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.783
<i>So, Kenya, what are you trying to do?</i>
<i>Start a Black Illuminati or something?</i>

38:05.866 --> 38:08.119
I promise you, it's not what I'm doing.

38:08.202 --> 38:12.164
<i>Dude, that shit already exists, man.</i>
<i>Jay-Z and Swizz Beatz started that shit.</i>

38:12.415 --> 38:14.041
<i>-Okay, Lena.</i>
<i>-Oh, okay.</i>

38:14.125 --> 38:17.336
[Lena] <i>I'm-- I'm not lying.</i>
<i>I've been to some of the meetings.</i>

38:17.420 --> 38:19.380
<i>-It's like a real thing.</i>
<i>-How you get invited?</i>

38:19.463 --> 38:22.800
<i>Like, they have meetings and stuff.</i>
<i>You get free haircuts.</i>

<i>It's a real situation.</i>

38:35.354 --> 38:37.315
<i>They got actual Black Illuminati cards.</i>

<i>-Lena, come on, man.</i>
<i>-I'm real!</i>

38:41.569 --> 38:43.654
Can we get back
to what this call was about?

38:43.738 --> 38:46.032
Did you guys see that link I sent you
with the movie?

38:46.115 --> 38:47.658
What did you think?

38:49.285 --> 38:50.161
<i>Who did it?</i>

38:50.578 --> 38:51.454
[bleep].

38:51.871 --> 38:53.748
<i>So it was pretty good. Pretty good.</i>

38:53.831 --> 38:56.167
<i>Yeah, I agree.</i>
<i>It was, it was-- it was cool.</i>

38:56.250 --> 38:58.044
I'm going to stop you right there.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.713
That shit was not cool.
There was nothing cool about that movie.

39:00.796 --> 39:02.089
You guys know it. Dude, come on!

39:02.173 --> 39:04.175
You know what I'm saying?
How are we ever going to get better

39:04.258 --> 39:05.676
if this is how we are with each other?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.471
We have to be able to talk honestly
if we want our art to progress.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.973
We do it all the time with white stuff.
Why can't we do it with our own stuff?

39:11.057 --> 39:12.683
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I don't know,

39:12.767 --> 39:15.269
like, if I asked you
what you thought about <i>Green Book.</i>

39:15.353 --> 39:17.396
<i>No. Please don't bring up that movie.</i>

39:17.480 --> 39:18.522
[Tim] <i>Oh, all right.</i>

39:18.606 --> 39:19.482
Okay, Ava.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.984
<i>Happy for Mahershala, though.</i>
<i>Happy for Mahershala.</i>

39:22.068 --> 39:23.527
[Kenya] Always happy for Mahershala,

39:23.611 --> 39:24.904
uh, but let's keep talking,

39:24.987 --> 39:26.405
let's keep that kind of loose environment.

39:26.489 --> 39:27.865
We're feeling real. That felt real.

39:27.948 --> 39:29.492
Let's go on that. Let's go that route.

39:29.575 --> 39:31.744
-Um, Iss...
<i>-Huh? </i>

39:31.869 --> 39:36.290
I happen to really, really enjoy <i>Insecure.</i>

39:36.374 --> 39:37.249
It's a good show.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.961
What do you think
about my show, <i>Black-ish?</i>

39:41.253 --> 39:43.089
<i>Oh! Uh...</i>

39:43.839 --> 39:44.673
<i>It's fine.</i>

39:45.883 --> 39:46.717
Fine?

39:46.801 --> 39:48.219
<i>Yeah, I mean, it's...</i>

39:48.969 --> 39:52.473
<i>It's for families.</i>
<i>I love black families, so...</i>

39:52.556 --> 39:53.391
Uh-huh.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.184
<i>I mean, I think some of your episodes</i>

39:55.267 --> 39:57.770
<i>could use some story-structure help</i>
<i>in the third act--</i>

39:57.853 --> 40:00.856
Because fucking <i>Wrinkle in Time</i>
was so ground-breaking?

40:00.940 --> 40:03.692
<i>I'm sorry, you know the innermost feelings</i>
<i>of nine-year-old girls?</i>

40:03.776 --> 40:05.403
-I'm sorry.
<i>-I wouldn't put it past him, Ava.</i>

40:05.486 --> 40:08.948
Black-ish<i> seems to tap into the hearts</i>
<i>and minds of 55-year-old white women.</i>

40:09.031 --> 40:10.783
[scoffs] That's very funny, Tim.

40:11.325 --> 40:13.035
Guess it was no <i>Ride Along 2,</i> though.

40:13.119 --> 40:16.080
<i>Whoa. Is that what we're doing now?</i>
<i>We're setting people up?</i>

40:16.163 --> 40:18.541
Dude, nobody's setting you up.
I'm just saying. Come on man,

40:18.624 --> 40:20.751
admit it was a money grab.
We all do money grabs. Come on.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.378
Will, back me up.
You're the king of money grabs.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.171
<i>Back you up how, dude?</i>

40:24.255 --> 40:28.259
<i>Uh, first of all, you got 7,000 projects</i>
<i>in development right now.</i>

40:28.342 --> 40:30.386
<i>You literally say no to nothing.</i>

40:30.469 --> 40:32.304
I probably would have said no
to <i>Night School.</i>

40:32.388 --> 40:33.806
<i>Oh, oh, I'm sorry.</i>

40:33.889 --> 40:36.934
<i>First of all, you didn't get asked</i>
<i>to write </i>Night School.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.020
<i>Second of all,  uh, </i>Night School <i>made</i>
<i>a hundred million dollars,</i>

40:40.104 --> 40:41.939
<i>-so you'd been sayin' no to that, sir.</i>
<i>-Preach.</i>

40:42.022 --> 40:44.191
<i>Maybe if they had called it</i>
"Night School-ish."

40:44.275 --> 40:45.443
[laughter]

40:45.526 --> 40:47.319
Ha-ha. That's very funny, Tim.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.738
<i>Yo, Tim, good one.</i>
<i>Hey, Tim, you know what?</i>

40:49.822 --> 40:52.616
<i>I'm about to hit you offline right now.</i>
<i>We need to talk writer ideas,</i>

40:52.700 --> 40:55.911
<i>'cause my </i>Girls Trip 2<i> writer</i>
<i>just fell out.</i>

40:55.995 --> 40:58.539
-I'm the writer for <i>Girls Trip 2.</i>
<i>-I'll hit you right now.</i>

40:58.622 --> 41:00.624
<i>Yeah. We should hang up on him.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

41:00.708 --> 41:01.917
Okay.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.545
Now that I guess we've gotten through
that first round of bonding

41:04.628 --> 41:06.881
over mutual disdain of my career,

41:06.964 --> 41:08.674
maybe we can talk about some other stuff.

41:08.757 --> 41:11.719
Can we talk about how we feel about <i>Power?</i>
People wanna talk about <i>Power?</i>

41:11.802 --> 41:15.014
<i>Kenya, this is not what I signed up for.</i>
<i>This is not constructive, brother.</i>

41:15.097 --> 41:16.474
<i>This is not positive.</i>

41:16.599 --> 41:19.935
[stammering] <i>This is not the beautiful</i>

<i>Will and Tim are calling and they're</i>
<i>probably talking shit about you,</i>

-What?

<i>We gotta talk about this shit, bro.</i>
<i>You've got a point.</i>

41:52.218 --> 41:54.011
<i>I don't like to admit that,</i>

<i>I was ready</i>

42:55.573 --> 42:57.157

-Okay. Cool.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.464
So, the ending...

43:12.965 --> 43:15.342
What were you going for
with your ending?

43:16.135 --> 43:17.177
[clears throat]

43:17.261 --> 43:20.723
Um, I would say-- I would argue that, uh,

43:20.973 --> 43:24.393
the ending, it's a commentary
on the social injustices

43:24.476 --> 43:26.770
that we, as black people, face

43:27.479 --> 43:29.189
post-civil rights,

43:29.273 --> 43:32.610
where every other marginalized group
in this country

43:32.693 --> 43:35.613
has made tremendous strides forward,
but we...

43:35.988 --> 43:38.699
we tend to be straggling behind.

43:38.782 --> 43:41.243
The imagery of a black man
playing a trumpet

43:41.327 --> 43:43.037
on top of a cotton gin,

43:43.120 --> 43:44.913
that ties earlier

43:44.997 --> 43:48.167
to the imagery of the record player

43:48.250 --> 43:51.920
playing the same song
that the trumpet player was playing

43:52.004 --> 43:53.047
at the end of the film.

43:53.130 --> 43:56.592
And, if you remember, uh, in minute 72,

43:56.967 --> 43:59.219
you see that pair of tap shoes,

43:59.553 --> 44:03.807
the same pair of tap shoes that
the main character, the protagonist,

44:03.891 --> 44:06.602
had been saving up for the entire film.

44:06.685 --> 44:09.897
They don't think I should have called
the ship the <i>SS Diabetes.</i>

44:09.980 --> 44:11.482
They felt like that was on the nose.

44:11.565 --> 44:13.817
So, if black joy

44:13.901 --> 44:15.944
is used to tell the story

44:16.028 --> 44:19.114
of a tap-dancing fry cook
on the Death Star,

44:19.198 --> 44:20.658
then let it be known.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.494
So that's what the ending was about.

44:24.119 --> 44:25.204
[Kenya] Hmm.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.581
Wow.

44:27.665 --> 44:28.540
-Yeah.
-Um...

44:28.624 --> 44:30.626
[crowd applauding] 

44:32.836 --> 44:35.839
But I think the thing
that I'm wondering is, like,

44:36.548 --> 44:38.926
at what point do you feel like

44:39.635 --> 44:42.429
any of that was a part of the movie?

44:42.680 --> 44:46.141
Because I'll be honest with you,
it felt a little bit scattered and...

44:46.892 --> 44:48.102
unfocused and...

44:49.061 --> 44:50.521
kinda pedestrian?

44:50.604 --> 44:51.814
[laughs, inhales sharply] 

44:51.897 --> 44:53.023
[Kenya] No offense.

44:53.107 --> 44:55.109
Oh. Okay. Uh...

44:55.192 --> 44:58.320
Don't insult it three times
and then say "no offense."

44:58.404 --> 45:01.115
Scattered and pedestrian?

45:01.198 --> 45:02.658
[Kenya] I think this is the issue.

45:02.741 --> 45:04.952
Okay, well, clearly
you didn't like it, right?

45:05.035 --> 45:06.578
I'm... I'm not saying I didn't like it.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.248
You had problems with it.
You're taking issue to it.

45:09.331 --> 45:10.999
Lena, you know what?
You have any questions?

45:11.083 --> 45:13.627
I would love to hear--
I would love to hear what you thought.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.254
Me and Lena talked, all right?

45:15.337 --> 45:17.131
She has some things to say,
but I mean...

45:17.214 --> 45:19.216
If I could, you know, interject.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.177
-Uh, I mean...
-[Kenya] Please. Thank you.

45:22.761 --> 45:24.304
To be honest...

45:25.347 --> 45:27.391
I liked it. [chuckles]
You know what I mean?

45:27.599 --> 45:29.643
[crowd applauding]

45:30.769 --> 45:34.314
I think you're saying a lot in the movie.
It's a lot of movie.

45:34.398 --> 45:37.651
We're not used to seeing ourselves
in these kind of roles,

45:38.277 --> 45:39.903
but ultimately,

45:39.987 --> 45:41.488
this is an important film.

45:41.947 --> 45:43.574
-It is?
-[Lena] It's a film we need to see.

45:43.657 --> 45:46.660
Kenya, we gotta root for black people.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.495
We gotta support each other.

45:49.079 --> 45:51.165
At least in public, you know what I mean?

45:51.248 --> 45:53.041
We need black unity.

45:53.125 --> 45:54.209
[applause]

45:54.293 --> 45:55.836
Yeah, yeah.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.213
Lena Waithe, everybody.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.385
[crowd cheering]

46:03.552 --> 46:06.054
[Lena] The future right here.
The future of black cinema, man.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.222
Oh. All right. We'll see. 

46:07.306 --> 46:09.224
Kenya, we'll talk. We'll talk after.

46:09.308 --> 46:11.310
-I don't think that's necessary.
-[Lena] Okay.

46:11.977 --> 46:13.979
-[Joya] How'd it go?
-[Kenya] I told him how I felt.

46:14.354 --> 46:15.230
[Joya] God.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.108
That's exactly the opposite
of what I told you to do.

46:18.192 --> 46:19.276
Yeah. [sighs] 

46:19.485 --> 46:22.780
Dude, the only reason I said anything
or even care about any of this

46:22.863 --> 46:25.491
is 'cause I'm, you know,
I am, dude, I'm hard on myself.

46:25.574 --> 46:28.952
I feel like I'm coming at him
the way I'd want him to come at me.

46:29.661 --> 46:32.122
If he had something to say about <i>Black-ish</i>
or this or that,

46:32.206 --> 46:33.457
I feel like I'd want to hear it,

46:33.540 --> 46:36.376
and that's the reason I want to tell him
the honest truth about his thing.

46:36.460 --> 46:38.712
I want him to be not just

46:39.254 --> 46:41.340
a great black director,

46:41.423 --> 46:43.342
or I want to be
not just a great black writer,

46:43.425 --> 46:44.968
I want to be a great writer who's black.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.429
Why can't you just be
with other black people

46:47.513 --> 46:51.058
and enjoy the success
that you all collectively have?

46:51.141 --> 46:53.477
Because the only way
that we're going to keep each other

46:53.977 --> 46:56.438
in the conversation
is to really police each other,

46:56.522 --> 46:58.941
because we're right now
in this thing where

46:59.191 --> 47:01.610
white people
aren't gonna be honest with us.

47:01.693 --> 47:05.072
They're either gonna celebrate us publicly
because that's what's hip right now,

47:05.155 --> 47:08.242
or secretly, behind the closed doors,
wait for our demise.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.869
So we have to sort of tell each other
the truth.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.454
That's the only way we get better.

47:12.538 --> 47:14.206
I don't know if that's our job.

47:14.289 --> 47:16.250
That certainly doesn't feel like my job.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.877
Whatever my job is,
I have not done a good job.

47:19.753 --> 47:21.338
-We failed.
-Yeah.

47:21.880 --> 47:22.923
We both failed.

47:23.257 --> 47:26.260
I mean... you a little bit more than me.

47:26.343 --> 47:29.805
I think you failed worse than me.
At least mine's not about money.

47:31.056 --> 47:32.891
-How big is the crack?
-It's big.

47:32.975 --> 47:35.769
Let's pray to God
we don't have an earthquake, you know?

47:35.853 --> 47:38.272
You know, I don't say this a lot, but...

47:38.897 --> 47:40.315
I'm proud of my dad.

47:41.066 --> 47:42.234
I really am.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.404
You know, he put it all on the line.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.990
Most people wouldn't have the balls
to do that.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.325
Probably for good reason, though.

47:51.493 --> 47:53.120
Man might have ruined his career.

47:53.620 --> 47:54.496
It's fine.

47:54.913 --> 47:57.124
I didn't think
he'd make it this far anyway.

47:57.291 --> 47:58.375
No one did.
