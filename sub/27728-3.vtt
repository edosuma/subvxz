00:01.201 --> 00:02.502
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...
Liz.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.571
Max.
You’re finally back.

00:04.571 --> 00:06.740
(gunshots)
Get down. No...

00:06.740 --> 00:09.343
ISOBEL:
20 years of keeping
this secret, and now

00:09.343 --> 00:11.545
you up and resurrect someone?

00:11.545 --> 00:13.614
KYLE:
When my dad was dying,
he’d repeat this crazy mantra.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.350
"If you see the handprint,
go to Manes."

00:16.350 --> 00:18.018
You’re telling me
you’re an alien?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.786
You change your mind
about our secret,

00:19.786 --> 00:21.922
no lock will keep me from you.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.957
Stay away from her!
ISOBEL:
What is wrong with you?

00:23.957 --> 00:27.127
Ever since I healed Liz, there’s
been this poison inside me. I...

00:27.127 --> 00:30.831
ISOBEL:
I am married to someone
who can’t ever know who I am,

00:30.831 --> 00:32.099
and that kills me.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.734
Is there really nobody
in this world

00:33.734 --> 00:35.569
that you wouldn’t risk
everything to save?

00:35.569 --> 00:37.704
LIZ:
I want to see Rosa’s
toxicology report.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.940
(gasps)
I think she was murdered.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.675
Max, I don’t feel
the way that you do.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.744
Want to blow off some steam?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.915
I’m gonna find out
who killed my sister,

00:47.915 --> 00:50.284
and I am gonna bring them
to justice.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.818
Even if it was Max Evans.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.023
LIZ:
The scientific method
requires the scientist

00:56.023 --> 00:59.159
to eliminate all personal bias
and outside influence.

00:59.159 --> 01:02.996
So it doesn’t matter
that Max Evans saved my life.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.699
Or that, ten years ago,
he was the only person

01:05.699 --> 01:08.302
who made me smile
after my mom left.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.305
Or how I feel
when he looks at me now.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.140
What matters is the science.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.077
Observation: in the hours
or days after my sister died,

01:17.077 --> 01:19.780
a strange mark,
shaped like a handprint,

01:19.780 --> 01:20.847
formed on her corpse.

01:22.149 --> 01:24.985
Observation: it’s the same mark

01:24.985 --> 01:28.755
Max Evans left on me
the night he saved my life.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.658
Observation:
Max Evans lied to my face

01:31.658 --> 01:34.661
about the last time
he saw Rosa alive.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.732
Prediction:
Max’s ability to manipulate

01:38.732 --> 01:41.735
electromagnetic energy gives
him the power to heal

01:41.735 --> 01:43.737
and also to harm.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.273
(shutter clicks)

01:48.675 --> 01:49.810

01:52.012 --> 01:54.948
Max Evans killed my sister.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.352

You said your patient--
the one with the handprint--

03:39.920 --> 03:41.955
is still alive.
Very much so.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.858
Is it possible that
maybe aliens aren’t

03:44.858 --> 03:45.859
the enemy of humanity?

03:45.859 --> 03:48.795
Now, you charged in here
demanding information

03:48.795 --> 03:50.130
about Rosa Ortecho’s death.

03:50.130 --> 03:53.133
I provided you with
that information. Your turn now.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.837
Can’t one of your kids be
your alien hunting buddy?

03:56.837 --> 03:58.105
You have four war hero sons.

Kyle,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.147
you can participate
in Project Shepherd

04:07.147 --> 04:08.882
because it is your legacy,

04:08.882 --> 04:10.984
or you can choose
to participate

04:10.984 --> 04:13.320
because you wisely fear

04:13.320 --> 04:15.856
what the United States
government could do to you

04:15.856 --> 04:17.791
and your quiet,

04:17.791 --> 04:20.827
small-town life.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.462
Not to mention your quiet,

04:22.462 --> 04:25.232
small-town friends.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.735
Your country eagerly awaits
your decision.

04:30.237 --> 04:34.141
I’m not going to tell you
where I saw the handprint.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.144
That’s okay. That’s not what
I want from you, anyway.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.346
I need access to your father’s
research material.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.249
You wanted to know why I didn’t
bring my boys into this.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.985
It’s because I don’t
need a soldier.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.287
I need a Valenti.

04:49.022 --> 04:52.559
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:52.559 --> 04:54.361
Nail polish remover is acetone.

04:54.361 --> 04:56.096
Trace amounts help with
active growth and regeneration

04:56.096 --> 04:58.999
in plants, but I have never
seen anything like this.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.300
It heals you?

05:00.300 --> 05:01.468
No.
More like it kills pain.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.270
We don’t heal
super fast or anything.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.305
Okay, when did you start to
realize that you were different?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.973
What’s the full extent
of your capabilities?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.209
I’m pretty good
at recognizing an interrogation.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.144
It’s kind of part of my gig.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.979
I’ve established your baseline.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.147
Now I’m monitoring
your electromagnetic output

05:14.147 --> 05:15.482
and how it correlates with...

05:15.482 --> 05:17.350
emotional triggers.
You mean like

05:17.350 --> 05:20.220
the light show that I put on
whenever I feel anything?

05:20.220 --> 05:22.923
Can you make that stop?
Because it’s really annoying.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.158
Maybe. If I know more.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.295
So...

05:29.229 --> 05:30.430
...Michael and Isobel.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.965
What powers
do they have, exactly?

05:31.965 --> 05:33.500
Do they leave handprints, too?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.068
I’m not gonna talk
about them, Liz.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.269
They don’t know
we’re doing this.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.604
Okay, are you all capable

05:37.604 --> 05:38.905
of electrostatic discharge--

05:38.905 --> 05:40.040
releasing energy intentionally?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.575
Maybe. We don’t know
how it works.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.911
In nature, there are animals--
plants, even--

05:44.911 --> 05:46.479
that do variations of this.
What are you getting at?

05:46.479 --> 05:48.481
T-They use electricity
as a defense mechanism.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.317
A-A weapon, even.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

05:50.317 --> 05:52.419
Liz...
So if you can heal
with electricity,

05:52.419 --> 05:53.353
can you also harm?

05:54.888 --> 05:58.158
Oh!

05:58.158 --> 05:59.926
Oh, my God. You’re hurt.
Are-are you okay?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.432
(quietly):
Lightning fractals.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.000
Here, let me-let me see.
No, no. I’m okay.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.568
Let me...
It’s fine.
Please don’t touch me.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.071
(door opens)

06:17.310 --> 06:19.145
(sighs)

06:19.145 --> 06:21.982
I have the entire
Air Force here

06:21.982 --> 06:23.683
for the veteran fundraiser,
and you’re out here

06:23.683 --> 06:25.986
playing, what, alien autopsy?

06:25.986 --> 06:28.154
She already knows our secret,
so what’s the harm?

06:28.154 --> 06:29.422
Maybe she can figure out
what’s wrong with me.

06:29.422 --> 06:30.323
Michael and I

06:30.323 --> 06:32.592
told you we’d help.
How?

06:32.592 --> 06:34.527
Look, whatever is wrong
with you, I’m pretty sure

06:34.527 --> 06:37.130
Liz didn’t take a class on it
at CU Boulder.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.099
I have questions,
and I trust Liz.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.066
We have a connection.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.269
Or we did, I think.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.405
Do you?

06:45.405 --> 06:48.174
Liz and Kyle hooked up
at the Wild Pony

06:48.174 --> 06:49.676
the day after she got into town.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.979
Did you know that? Hank
and Lindsey saw them.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.015
Your handprint

06:55.015 --> 06:57.384
was still on her chest.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.185
(stammers)

06:59.185 --> 07:02.055
Would you stay
out of my business, for once?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.723
Okay? Quit using my life
as a distraction

07:03.723 --> 07:05.358
for your own messed-up
relationship.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.395
You are my business, Max.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.730
I care about you.
I love you.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.466
Liz flat-out told you
she’s just not that into you.

07:13.466 --> 07:16.169
At least she knows me.
Just because you’re jealous

07:16.169 --> 07:17.404
that someone knows
the truth about me

07:17.404 --> 07:19.072
when your whole marriage
is built on a lie...

07:19.072 --> 07:22.108
Shut up! Liz is using

07:22.108 --> 07:25.211
your feelings for her to gather
data, and you are letting her.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.147
It’s like you’ll agree to any
excuse to be close to her.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.082
It’s pathetic.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.119
LIZ:
I trusted you.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.654
Promise me you won’t tell
anyone what I told you.

07:34.654 --> 07:37.157
I know you want to believe
Max is a golden retriever,

07:37.157 --> 07:38.625
but he’s a friggin’
X-file, Liz.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.061
This proves it.
It’s a superficial injury.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.295
Yeah, well, that’s not.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.563
You and I both know this level

07:43.563 --> 07:45.532
of energy output
could be lethal.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.234
I really think we
should turn him in.
To who--

07:48.234 --> 07:48.968
the cops?

07:48.968 --> 07:51.371
I don’t know. The government?

07:51.371 --> 07:53.306
Right. So the president
can sic the Space Force

07:53.306 --> 07:54.741

07:54.741 --> 07:57.077

an alien life form.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.081
Max Evans is only half
the story.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.250
Look, I had to provoke Max
for this to happen.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.954
So what could Rosa have done
to provoke him?

08:11.257 --> 08:13.226
She used to hide things
all the time.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.694
She liked secrets.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.367
See this heart here?

08:22.235 --> 08:23.503
This is one of her spots.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.244
Typical.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.581
What were you
hoping to find?

08:34.581 --> 08:37.183
Murder investigations
have clues. I want a clue.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.551
You have a clue.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.520
You just keep
ignoring it because...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.122
Is it because he’s tall?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.189
Never mind
that he explodes

08:43.189 --> 08:44.324
expensive things with his brain.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.160
I need a motive.
Okay, Nancy Drew.

No, I need to understand

09:58.298 --> 10:00.500
So, you, uh...

10:00.500 --> 10:03.870
Your car need
a tune-up, or...?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.772
I just came from Max’s.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.143
He’s letting Liz
experiment on him.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.144
(bottle clatters)

10:11.144 --> 10:12.245
Please say "sexually."

10:12.245 --> 10:13.546
If a biomedical engineer

10:13.546 --> 10:14.781
knows how Max is put together,

10:14.781 --> 10:16.816
she’s gonna know how
to dismantle him.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.218
Yeah.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.285
All of us.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.721
She’s using him. I know it.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.790
We have to get her far away
from our brother.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.127
And I have a plan.

10:38.037 --> 10:41.040
Well, I never thought
I would see the day

10:41.040 --> 10:46.212
Liz Ortecho beat a town
full of drunks to the bar.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.514
Rough night?
Night.

10:47.514 --> 10:49.482
Morning. Decade.

10:49.482 --> 10:54.254
I found this in one
of Rosa’s hidey-holes.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.656
I can get you weed that’s not
100 years old, if you want.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.057
(laughs)

10:58.057 --> 11:00.159
Though this might still be good.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.162
I was hoping you could help me
learn more of her secrets.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.664
Stuff that she
wouldn’t tell me.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.699
Stuff that she’d
only tell you.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.135
Check behind
the "No Hunting" sign.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.352
It’s the most
Rosa mix ever.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.087
All ’90s songs.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.622
TLC. Goo Goo Dolls.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.491
She’s even got some
Ginuwine on there.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.229
No, uh, I don’t think
these are song titles.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.298
I mean, they are,
but I...

11:38.298 --> 11:39.365
think they’re clues.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.601
Track one,
"Here in Your Bedroom"

11:41.601 --> 11:45.405
That’s our bedroom. "Pony."

11:45.405 --> 11:48.374
I mean, this is
her exact brand

11:48.374 --> 11:50.209
of teen melodrama,
a treasure map

11:50.209 --> 11:51.311
to all her little hiding places.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.780
I know, I-I figured
that was the the case, I just...

11:53.780 --> 11:56.215
I didn’t want
to invade her privacy.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.217
Even now.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.453
Well, as a little sister,

12:00.453 --> 12:03.222
invading my big sister’s privacy
is my born prerogative.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.358
Even now.

12:05.358 --> 12:06.526
Track three.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.861
"Under the Bridge."

12:08.861 --> 12:10.296
You coming?

12:10.296 --> 12:11.397
Yeah.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.233
Yeah!

12:17.537 --> 12:20.173
Whoa. Save that
for when the machines

12:20.173 --> 12:22.241
actually take over.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.677
What is this?
Um...

12:24.677 --> 12:27.380
they were going to sell it
at the police auction.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.317
This is a first edition, Cam.

12:31.317 --> 12:35.154
Yup. Knew that would give you
a nerd boner.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.294
Let’s go to the
drive-in tonight.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.398
Uh... (clears throat)

12:45.398 --> 12:46.799
like a date?

12:46.799 --> 12:48.635
Yeah.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.336
I thought we had more of a...
(clears throat)

12:50.336 --> 12:53.206
(deep voice): "Hey, you up?"
kind of thing going on.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.676
I know, but I-I thought maybe
it was... maybe it’s time.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.780
Yeah. Why not?

13:00.780 --> 13:03.716
Let’s go to the drive-in.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.352
Maybe after you can
take me to the malt shop

13:06.352 --> 13:07.754
and then pin
your letter

13:07.754 --> 13:11.257
on my sweater.
(chuckling): Okay.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.363
Listen...

13:17.363 --> 13:20.333
I’ve been thinking
a lot about dad lately.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.601
Remember those letters he sent

13:21.601 --> 13:23.269
when he was in hospice?

13:23.269 --> 13:25.304
Can’t find them anywhere.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.474
The cancer changed him.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.876
By the end,

13:29.876 --> 13:32.478
he’d look at me and
I could see in his eyes

13:32.478 --> 13:34.414
he had no clue
who I was.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.482
He was mailing us
letters even when

13:36.482 --> 13:38.384
we were sitting
by his bedside every day.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.822
You’re better off not
digging into the past.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.924
Hang on to the good memories.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.561
LIZ: I’m just trying
to fill in the gaps

13:48.561 --> 13:50.363
of who my sister really was.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.764
You already know that.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.233
She was electric.
Impulsive.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.335
She was a "hold your hair
back when you’re sick,

13:56.335 --> 13:58.905
slash your ex’s tires"
type of friend.

13:58.905 --> 14:02.709
She was a total flake.
Completely unreliable.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.845
But, somehow, when
you needed her most,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.347
she always seemed to
show up right on time.

14:08.347 --> 14:11.517
She isn’t what’s left over
in the dirty crevices

14:11.517 --> 14:13.186
of this town.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.589
Maybe not.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.392
But maybe.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.295
(grunts)

14:42.815 --> 14:44.550
"Dear Rosa,

14:44.550 --> 14:46.385
you will never be alone."

14:46.385 --> 14:47.687
Signed Ophiuchus.

14:47.687 --> 14:49.989
I’m gonna assume that if someone
in Roswell was named Ophiuchus

14:49.989 --> 14:52.024
we’d know them.
Must be a pseudonym.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.927
Ophiuchus is the 13th sign
of the zodiac.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.296
It’s a little controversial
in certain circles.

14:57.296 --> 14:59.432
A fraudulent zodiac.
The lyric that she had written
Mm.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.733
on her hand when she died.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.469
Maybe it wasn’t a random lyric
from a random song.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.537
Maybe this means
something.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.405
I mean, this note
feels romantic.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.473
Think she was seeing someone?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.309
Maria.
Hmm?

15:10.309 --> 15:12.478
She’s dead. Spill.
She didn’t mention anyone.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.416
But I slept at your
house that week.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.719
I saw her sneak out the window,
and she had taken

15:19.719 --> 15:21.554
a little extra care
with the eyeliner,

15:21.554 --> 15:23.856
so I figured
there must be a boy.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.626
You were a good friend to her.

15:27.693 --> 15:31.030
Now come on.
Mixtape map beckons.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.466
"Small Town Saturday Night"
by Hal Ketchum.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.334
Maybe the drive-in?

15:38.104 --> 15:42.008

at the man I could be ♪

15:42.008 --> 15:45.011
♪ I did all the right things

15:50.583 --> 15:52.552
So, you gonna mind-warp Liz

15:52.552 --> 15:54.754
before or after Mars Attacks?

15:54.754 --> 15:56.489
I’ll know
when the time is right.

15:58.357 --> 15:59.759
Just curious about
why you’re down to

15:59.759 --> 16:01.561
get in Liz’s mind and
send her out of town.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.461
And at the reunion you were

16:02.461 --> 16:04.564
scandalized when I suggested it.
You know,

16:04.564 --> 16:06.632
I don’t think you appreciate
just how miserable it is

16:06.632 --> 16:08.568
for me to have to gaze
into the deep,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.670
dark abyss
that is the human psyche.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.572
Nevertheless,

16:12.572 --> 16:15.675
things have escalated.
And I don’t disagree.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.644
But I also think you’re scared.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.046
Yeah, of exposure.
Of not being

16:20.046 --> 16:21.881
the number-one person
in Max’s life.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.551
Of him... loving Liz
more than he loves you.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.553
Michael Guerin
at a town event?

16:27.553 --> 16:28.621
ISOBEL:
Noah!

16:28.621 --> 16:31.624
Projector broke.
I fixed it.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.992
Oh, I could’ve...

16:33.960 --> 16:35.995
Yeah, yeah, good call.
Thanks, bro.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.001
You missed dinner last night.
I know.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.870
I’m sorry.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.672
It was Max. He had, uh,
girl problems.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.909
Yeah. Same.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.078
Seriously, baby, I’m sorry.

16:52.078 --> 16:53.045
Mm-hmm.

16:53.045 --> 16:56.115
Hey, how about this.
Mm?

16:56.115 --> 16:57.750
Why don’t we switch
things up tonight?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.086
Hmm? What can I be for you?

17:00.086 --> 17:03.522
Mm, maybe tonight

17:03.522 --> 17:05.191
we could, uh,

17:05.191 --> 17:08.895
both just be... present.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.870
ALEX:
Leaving so soon?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.774
Seen it before.

17:21.774 --> 17:23.676
I hate how it ends.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.812
I’ll tell you what,

17:26.812 --> 17:29.749
I’ll split this sixer
with you...

17:29.749 --> 17:31.617

18:22.735 --> 18:23.936
Hey!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.072
Can I help you find
something, Valenti?

18:30.710 --> 18:32.278
What were you doing
in the file room?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.780
Visiting my mom.
Guess she was out.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.016
I could have you arrested.

18:37.016 --> 18:38.851
Oh, I get it.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.754
Is this massive
overreaction about Liz?

18:44.724 --> 18:46.726
Are you into her?

18:50.096 --> 18:52.965
You must’ve heard.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.634
About the Wild Pony
parking lot.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.474
Do you want me to hit you?

19:01.474 --> 19:03.376
Well, that wouldn’t
be very lawful of you.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.678
Though I think you’ve
wanted to for a long time.

19:05.678 --> 19:06.879
You don’t know
anything about me.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.881
Do we have
a problem here?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.649
KYLE:
All good.

19:10.649 --> 19:14.320
Just a couple of New Roswell
High buddies catching up.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.957
We doing this movie thing
or not?

19:17.957 --> 19:20.559
Yeah.

We are.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.068
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

19:32.638 --> 19:34.907
Oh, careful, son.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.546
Oh, you got me, you got me.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.448
Heartwarming.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.783
Hey.

19:43.783 --> 19:47.053
Maybe you ought to
call it a night, huh?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.687
Use the evening to
educate yourself

19:48.687 --> 19:52.391
on how to properly
represent your country.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.065
Do I embarrass you, Dad?

20:02.935 --> 20:03.903
You are a

20:03.903 --> 20:06.439
decorated purple heart soldier

20:06.439 --> 20:08.174
with three deployments
under his belt.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.610
Guerin is arrested once a week
for gambling and bar fighting.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.914
Seems to me the only one you’re
embarrassing is yourself, son.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.821
Evening.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.856
Thank you, Roswell,

20:23.856 --> 20:26.158
for making the third annual
Night At The Drive-In

20:26.158 --> 20:28.894
such a success.
Because of you,

20:28.894 --> 20:31.897
we more than doubled
last year’s donations

20:31.897 --> 20:33.599
to the local V.A. clinic.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.835
(cheering)

20:35.835 --> 20:38.771
Here to represent
the brave women and men

20:38.771 --> 20:40.005
of our armed forces,

20:40.005 --> 20:42.808
Master Sergeant Jesse Manes.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.845
Thank you.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.513
Thank you, Isobel.

20:47.513 --> 20:49.715
Uh, thank you all
for being here. Good evening.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.484
For the past 70 years--

20:51.484 --> 20:53.986
more than 70 years, actually--
Roswell...

20:53.986 --> 20:57.022
Come on, just say it.
You hate this town party stuff.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.691
Am I breaking out
in hives?

20:58.691 --> 21:01.160
Well, we can go back
to Wild Pony for a drink.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.828
After we find
Rosa’s hiding spot.

21:02.828 --> 21:04.196
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

21:04.196 --> 21:07.800
MANES:
When, uh, when the risks

21:07.800 --> 21:09.735
and sacrifices of battle...

21:09.735 --> 21:10.803
Why are we really here?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.771
Something’s up with you.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.840
(laughs)
Can’t lie to a psychic.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.743
I-I...
Mm-mmm.

21:17.743 --> 21:19.712
(laughs)
Okay, fine.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.015
I wanted an excuse
to spy on Max and his date.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.218
Tall blondes
are totally not his type.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.624
(chuckles)

21:31.624 --> 21:32.725
If we’re stalking,

21:32.725 --> 21:34.293
I need a corndog.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.861
And I’m getting
you a michelada.

21:35.861 --> 21:38.063
MANES:
Inaction means the loss

21:38.063 --> 21:41.200
of everything that we’ve worked
so hard to build.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.670
Inaction means
that we give up this...

21:44.670 --> 21:46.605
(high-pitched ringing)

21:59.785 --> 22:01.120
Hello, Liz.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.657
I need you to do
something for me.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.159
(gasps)
Rosa?

22:14.833 --> 22:17.536
Why are you being like this?
I thought we were friends.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.677
Liz.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.878
Yes?

22:29.648 --> 22:32.251
It’s time for you
to leave Roswell.

22:32.251 --> 22:35.321
And don’t come back this time.

22:35.321 --> 22:39.024
I wish it could
always be like this.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.329
Stop.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.197
I can’t leave.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.299
Why not?

22:47.299 --> 22:49.468
What is keeping you here?

22:49.468 --> 22:51.870
Max.

22:55.441 --> 22:58.143
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

23:04.516 --> 23:06.085
MARIA:
Earth to Liz.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.053
Yes. Hi. Yeah. What?

23:08.053 --> 23:09.355
I think I figured out the clue.

23:09.355 --> 23:10.656
This isn’t Rosa’s idea

23:10.656 --> 23:13.325
of a small town
Saturday night,

23:13.325 --> 23:15.661
but I know what is.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.197
(laughs)

23:21.333 --> 23:22.635
MICHAEL:
Oh...

23:22.635 --> 23:26.238
I know a run and puke face
when I see one.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.406
(exhales sharply)

23:27.406 --> 23:30.276
Uh, did you do it?
Is she leaving town?

23:30.276 --> 23:32.511
No, I, uh...

23:32.511 --> 23:34.380
I don’t think
it’s gonna be that easy.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.416
You weren’t strong enough?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.051
No, Michael. It...

23:39.051 --> 23:41.387
I... I don’t know,

23:41.387 --> 23:43.289
I just, uh...
I got into her mind,

23:43.289 --> 23:46.625
and then I-I just couldn’t
go through with it, so...

23:46.625 --> 23:48.460
Couldn’t or wouldn’t, Isobel?

23:48.460 --> 23:52.131
You don’t understand. Okay?

23:52.131 --> 23:56.101
I kept getting these weird
flashes of Rosa, and...

23:56.101 --> 23:58.003
Liz was there. I could see
what she was seeing, you know?

23:58.003 --> 24:00.372
I could feel what she was
feeling, and then, and...

24:00.372 --> 24:03.309
and she said Max’s name, and
there was this, like, rush,

24:03.309 --> 24:04.510
and it was, like, I don’t think

24:04.510 --> 24:06.312
that this is just
some high school crush.

24:06.312 --> 24:08.414
I think that
she and Max may be...

24:08.414 --> 24:10.749
MAX:
Maybe she and Max what?

24:10.749 --> 24:12.785
Run.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.321
It’s the cops.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.423
Officer.

24:17.423 --> 24:18.557
Hi.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.259
Hi.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.194
Your speech was good.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.029
(chuckles)

24:24.029 --> 24:26.565
I didn’t think that you were
gonna show up, after I...

24:26.565 --> 24:29.268
Maybe you were right.

24:30.602 --> 24:32.404
Maybe Liz isn’t
gonna happen for me.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.173
Cameron and I
were hooking up

24:34.173 --> 24:35.541
before Liz
got back into town.

24:35.541 --> 24:38.110
Maybe that could be something,

24:38.110 --> 24:39.778
if I try.

24:39.778 --> 24:41.347
(rumbling)

24:43.148 --> 24:46.719
(sighs) I was really hoping
for E.T. this year.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.588
No. Xenophobia sells
more tickets, so...

24:56.295 --> 24:58.430
MARIA:
Okay.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.836
Let’s see...

25:03.836 --> 25:07.139
LIZ:
You sure it’s up here?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.775
Rosa and I used to sneak up here
after you fell asleep.

25:09.775 --> 25:12.378
(sighs)
I think we got it wrong again.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.347
Oh, come on, Liz.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.383
Relax.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.485
Spend a small town
Saturday night

25:19.485 --> 25:22.488
in Rosa’s shoes.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.059
♪ ♪

25:31.163 --> 25:32.431
Here you are. Enjoy.

25:51.450 --> 25:53.852
MARIA:
So while you were
getting your bachelor’s

25:53.852 --> 25:56.488
in biomed engineering,
I was dating

25:56.488 --> 25:58.123
a Chad.

25:58.123 --> 25:59.458
Ugh.
Mm-hmm.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.126
Changed my relationship
status and everything.

26:01.126 --> 26:04.129
Why do parents name
their kid Chad?

26:04.129 --> 26:07.166
All the Chads
end up being Chads.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.233
Right?

26:08.233 --> 26:09.368
Ugh.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.570
(laughs)

26:11.570 --> 26:13.272
I missed this.

26:14.506 --> 26:17.242
I left my fiancé in Denver
three weeks ago.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.377
Diego.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.480
(both laugh)

26:21.480 --> 26:24.183
I don’t know why I’m laughing.

26:24.183 --> 26:25.751
No. He’s perfect.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.754
It’s not funny.
I just...
Mm, sorry.

26:28.754 --> 26:31.423
I couldn’t connect.
I couldn’t feel anything.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.458
Yeah.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.626
(both laugh)

26:40.098 --> 26:41.900
What did you and Rosa
do up here?

26:41.900 --> 26:43.769
We smoked.
Mm.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.839
Drank. Looked at
the stars and, um...

26:46.839 --> 26:50.876
the first one to find Pisces
got to dare the other one

26:50.876 --> 26:52.878
to do something
really stupid.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.813
(both chuckle)

26:54.813 --> 26:56.748
That was her sign.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.650
See, right there?

26:58.650 --> 27:00.919
Two fish.
Hmm.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.821
Just looks like an arrow to me.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.858
That’s what Rosa
always used to say.

27:05.858 --> 27:09.661
Maybe you two didn’t think
so differently after all.

27:36.321 --> 27:37.756
God...

27:42.060 --> 27:44.696
It’s a love letter.

27:44.696 --> 27:47.533
From who? Ophiuchus?

27:58.644 --> 28:00.612
Okay, we have, um,

28:00.612 --> 28:03.549
most of the teenage
dream date...

28:03.549 --> 28:04.650
covered.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.352
Um, the movie,

28:07.352 --> 28:09.721
popcorn.

28:09.721 --> 28:13.458
Just one essential

28:13.458 --> 28:15.294
high school
experience missing.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.795
And what would that be?

28:17.863 --> 28:20.299
What are...
This.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.301
Oh... oh.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.535
Okay.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.474
(thud)

28:29.474 --> 28:30.943
Max.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.644
I’m sorry, we’re closed.
Could you come back?

28:32.644 --> 28:34.580
I need to talk to you, now.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.483
(sighs)

28:43.889 --> 28:45.324
Liz.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.960
Liz, stop.
What is this about?

28:47.960 --> 28:49.628
You were sleeping
with my sister.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.732
Explain that.

28:59.037 --> 29:01.940
Liz. Me again.
I swear, if you got yourself...

29:01.940 --> 29:05.410
Kyle Manuel Valenti.

29:05.410 --> 29:09.081
You’d make
a terrible criminal.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.886
Care to explain yourself?

29:14.886 --> 29:18.323
I was looking
for Max Evans’s file.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.627
We’re in a kind of...
love triangle.

29:21.627 --> 29:24.463
Wanted to get
some dirt on him,

29:24.463 --> 29:25.597
there wasn’t any.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.766
Is this about Liz Ortecho?

29:28.700 --> 29:30.335
(laughs softly)
Kyle.

29:30.335 --> 29:31.370
What?

29:31.370 --> 29:32.537
I don’t like her family.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.373
My parents struggled
for years

29:34.373 --> 29:37.409
in poverty so that they could
enter this country legally,

29:37.409 --> 29:39.111
because they believed
in America.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.547
In freedom,
in patriotism, in the law.

29:42.547 --> 29:45.617
And people who defy that law
give us all a bad name.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.552
You sound like a bigot.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.321
And you sound so naive.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.257
Rosa Ortecho killed those girls,
and it tore this town in half.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.459
You were away at school,
but your father nearly lost

29:54.459 --> 29:57.062
the election that year.

29:57.062 --> 29:59.731
Jesse Manes vocally supported
some white candidate,

29:59.731 --> 30:03.368
and you know how this town
loves to vote military.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.238
I thought Master Sergeant Manes
and dad were friends.

30:06.238 --> 30:10.208
Jesse Manes doesn’t have
friends, Kyle.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.543
He has soldiers.

30:16.715 --> 30:19.351
"I feel like
I’m disappearing

30:19.351 --> 30:21.086
"until you look at me,

30:21.086 --> 30:23.221
"and then
I’m so completely seen.

30:23.221 --> 30:25.457
I’ve never liked
that feeling before."
Please, just stop. Come on.

30:25.457 --> 30:26.558
No, you really
captured her.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.660
"Somehow, you always stand
in the part of the room

30:28.660 --> 30:30.228
that the sun
hits first."

30:30.228 --> 30:31.596
I wrote that note for you, Liz.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.432
Don’t lie to me.
"You touched my lips

30:33.432 --> 30:36.334
and I stopped breathing for
a week." This isn’t about us.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.470
You and I
never kissed.
No, we didn’t.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.543
It was April of senior year.

30:44.543 --> 30:47.179
I had hot sauce on my lips

30:47.179 --> 30:50.182
and no one told me
for, like, three hours.

30:50.182 --> 30:53.452
And then you wiped it off
with your thumb in lab.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.387
The day we...

30:57.456 --> 31:00.692
...got sent home early ’cause
there was a school blackout.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.563
(sniffles)

31:04.563 --> 31:06.598
Rosa must have found the letter.

31:06.598 --> 31:09.134
I was 17.
I wanted to be a writer.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.869
I’m not accusing you
of some high school affair,

31:10.869 --> 31:12.537
I am accusing you
of something else.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.106
I know that
you lied to me

31:14.106 --> 31:16.174
about the last time
that you saw her.

31:16.174 --> 31:18.643
I know that you met her
the night that she died,

31:18.643 --> 31:20.512
and I know that my sister
was murdered.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.347
By an alien.

31:22.347 --> 31:24.716
What? How-how do you...

31:24.716 --> 31:27.085
So was it you, Max?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.562
Hey.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.631
You want to go for a ride?

31:39.631 --> 31:42.467
This isn’t gonna
work out, Guerin.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.606
I cannot ignore
what I saw tonight.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.074
Your side hustle.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.579
Yeah.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.181
Occasionally, I pawn
a spool of copper wire

31:56.181 --> 31:58.450
from the junkyard for
a little extra cash.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.484
(scoffs)

31:59.484 --> 32:00.852
Who cares?

32:00.852 --> 32:02.387
I do.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.822
I’m a soldier.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.524
I can’t be with a criminal.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.394
All my life,

32:09.394 --> 32:11.863
the system has put me
at the mercy of criminals.

32:11.863 --> 32:13.198
(scoffs)

32:13.198 --> 32:14.733
I’m just trying to survive it.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.637
Guess you’re still
the guy just looking

32:18.637 --> 32:20.705
for any excuse
to walk away, huh?

32:22.574 --> 32:24.176
Maybe.

32:24.176 --> 32:27.245
And you’re still so good
at giving them to me.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.258
(sighs)
LIZ: I have spent

32:40.258 --> 32:42.727
ten years thinking that
my sister killed herself

32:42.727 --> 32:44.329
and two other people,
but it turns out

32:44.329 --> 32:45.096
that that was all a lie.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.965
Your lie!
Yes, you’re right.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.533
I lied to you.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.535
Okay? I did see Rosa that night.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.706
(sighs)

32:54.706 --> 32:56.508
After we got back
from the desert,

32:56.508 --> 32:57.776
I dropped you off
but I didn’t go home.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.244
I sat in the gazebo

32:59.244 --> 33:01.980
and I wrote that letter.
And I slid it

33:01.980 --> 33:03.648
under the windshield wiper
of your car

33:03.648 --> 33:05.817
and then Rosa was there.

33:05.817 --> 33:09.221
And she was drunk
and high and angry,

33:09.221 --> 33:10.989
and she was telling me
to stay away from you.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.291
She started yelling
and shoving me.

33:13.291 --> 33:16.862
S-So what?
You... you killed her?

33:16.862 --> 33:18.663
No.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.299
I drove away.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.468
She was messed up

33:23.468 --> 33:24.903
and I knew it.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.572
I... The diner was still open.

33:27.572 --> 33:28.640
I could have gotten your dad.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.475
I should have stayed with her.

33:30.475 --> 33:31.576
I asked you,

33:31.576 --> 33:33.879
point-blank...

33:33.879 --> 33:35.347
if you saw her that night.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.450
You have enough
painful memories.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.787
After everything...

33:42.787 --> 33:44.890
that we have
been through,

33:44.890 --> 33:48.560
do you truly believe
that I am capable

33:48.560 --> 33:50.862
of killing someone you love?

That’s not what this is about.

34:06.578 --> 34:09.614
Well, that’s what everything
is about for me.

34:11.416 --> 34:12.617
(sighs)

34:12.617 --> 34:14.686
You know what,
maybe-maybe my sister’s right.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.355
Maybe I am pathetic.

34:17.355 --> 34:19.724
But I would...

34:19.724 --> 34:21.826
never kill Rosa.

34:25.030 --> 34:28.500
Leave the past in the past.

Ah. How did the rest
of the night go?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.082
So good.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.718
We more than doubled
last year’s donations.

You don’t have to do this.
No.

35:31.730 --> 35:35.867
I said we’d have a nice night,
and look, I’m here, I’m present.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.535
Isobel, I love you,

35:37.535 --> 35:38.370
with my entire heart,

35:38.370 --> 35:41.339
How... did the rest
of your night go?

35:43.475 --> 35:44.809
(sighs)

(sniffles)

35:48.813 --> 35:51.416

Noah...

35:51.416 --> 35:52.717
I’m sorry.

35:52.717 --> 35:55.487
I know that I’ve been absent.
I know that I’m codependent

35:55.487 --> 35:57.389
on Max and...
Hey, hey,
that’s okay.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.858
I knew what I was
marrying into. It’s...
Everything is

35:59.858 --> 36:02.861
falling apart, and I don’t know
how to put it back together.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.896
You know, Max is my...
is my person.

36:04.896 --> 36:07.465
He always has been.

36:07.465 --> 36:10.835
But now he’s in love, and...

36:10.835 --> 36:14.139
...and she loves him back,

36:14.139 --> 36:15.840
deep down.

36:18.643 --> 36:22.814
I know you don’t want your
brother to be unhappy.
No.

36:22.814 --> 36:23.982
It’s...
No, it just...

36:23.982 --> 36:25.850
That’s the point.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.387
I think that this whole time
he has been, and I didn’t know.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.826
And I think that
maybe it was my fault.

36:36.761 --> 36:38.096
Mm-mmm.

36:38.096 --> 36:40.165
Iz...

36:40.165 --> 36:43.735
look, maybe for a little while,
you could stop worrying

36:43.735 --> 36:45.804
about how happy he is.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.808
Maybe instead,
you could just let me...

36:49.808 --> 36:51.976
worry...
(laughs)

36:51.976 --> 36:53.978
about how happy you are.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.550

Why?

Yeah, I don’t know.

You can’t keep summoning me.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.163
You could stop showing up.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.699
Can I?
Because every word

38:54.699 --> 38:57.101
out of your mouth feels
like a thinly-veiled threat.

38:57.101 --> 38:58.770
I know the stories about

38:58.770 --> 39:01.806
how people who refuse
to conspire end up suffering.

But you weren’t
friends at all.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.584
Were you?

39:12.584 --> 39:15.086
I checked the records.
You didn’t visit him once

39:15.086 --> 39:19.057
while he was dying.
Jim and I had our
differences, yes.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.893
We shared one goal.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.962
Protect our town and our world

39:23.962 --> 39:25.163
from the imminent alien threat.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.198
(laughs)
Imminent?

39:27.198 --> 39:29.367
The crash was in 1947.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.969
If they pose a threat
to humanity,

39:30.969 --> 39:32.136
they’re taking their sweet time.

39:32.136 --> 39:35.707
Unless your boy
Paul Ryan is an alien.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.941
Have some respect.

39:36.941 --> 39:38.643
I do have respect.

39:38.643 --> 39:41.145
My ancestors sacrificed
everything to come here,

39:41.145 --> 39:42.780
so I could live
the American dream.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.285
But my family also believes
in the justice system.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.022
Innocent until proven guilty.

39:51.022 --> 39:53.725

anyone to you, either.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.265

40:01.799 --> 40:04.335
These are the letters
my dad wrote when he was dying.

40:04.335 --> 40:06.638
If he was trying
to tell someone something,

40:06.638 --> 40:09.974
it’s somewhere
in all this crazy.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.075
Hey.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.946
We’re square now.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.748
You gave me
Rosa’s autopsy photos;

40:16.748 --> 40:19.217
I give you my dad’s
alien Rosetta stone.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.252
Do with it
what you will.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.261
Now I’m out.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.096
I’m not your soldier.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.098
You made the right choice.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.767
Although you should know

40:35.767 --> 40:38.236
there’s one fatal flaw
in our system.

40:39.837 --> 40:41.839
Innocent until proven
guilty means that

40:41.839 --> 40:44.876
justice can only be served
after disaster has struck.

40:49.814 --> 40:53.017
(ringtone playing)

40:53.017 --> 40:55.253
(both laugh)

41:02.193 --> 41:04.362
Every time
a terrorist is caught,

41:04.362 --> 41:06.164
you know what
his neighbors say, right?

41:08.166 --> 41:11.402
"He was such a nice guy.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.204
"Smart. Thoughtful.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.474
"He hardly bothered anyone.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.909

41:17.909 --> 41:19.243
"Kept to himself a lot.

41:20.745 --> 41:23.181
Michael, when you get this,
get over here.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.052
Certainly not the type
to build an arsenal."

41:28.052 --> 41:30.054
(roaring grunts)

41:30.054 --> 41:31.189
And then...

41:31.189 --> 41:32.223
(yelling)

41:32.223 --> 41:33.291
...boom.

41:35.193 --> 41:36.995
