WEBVTT

01:06.199 --> 01:07.499
D'you mind
if I turn this down?

01:07.501 --> 01:08.434
No.

01:10.603 --> 01:10.602
<i> You're on with Phil.</i>

01:10.604 --> 01:14.606
<i> Davis. Where are we</i>
<i> with the lightyear deal?</i>

01:14.608 --> 01:16.241
The banks won't budge,
you know.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.077
They're claiming
regulations as an excuse.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.579
Same thing they did
with haskell athletic.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.648
<i> Yeah, yeah...</i>
<i> What, they want more cushion?</i>

01:23.383 --> 01:25.551
Yup. 5%.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.320
<i> All right, very good.</i>
<i> Is my daughter with you?</i>

01:28.322 --> 01:30.355
Hey, dad.

01:30.357 --> 01:33.225
<i> Hey, your mother's upset.</i>
<i> Why aren't you talking?</i>

01:33.227 --> 01:35.227
That's between me and mom.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.363
<i> Well, you should</i>
<i> call. She's hard-headed.</i>

01:38.365 --> 01:40.732
Well, I guess that's
where I get it from.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.202
Well, we'll talk it out on
Sunday at dinner, okay?

01:44.304 --> 01:46.171
Okay. Bye, dad.
<i> All right love. Bye-bye.</i>

01:50.710 --> 01:52.377
Have you looked
at the refrigerator yet?

01:53.880 --> 01:57.216
Huh? The refrigerator?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.318
Yeah. The box in our kitchen
that keeps things cold.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.120
Yeah.

02:01.122 --> 02:03.655
No. Uh, what about it?

02:03.657 --> 02:06.258
It's leaking... it's been
leaking for two weeks.

02:08.328 --> 02:10.329
The refrigerator's leaking.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.463
Please don't do
that thing where you

02:11.465 --> 02:13.265
repeat part of what I said

02:13.267 --> 02:14.266
so I'll think
you're paying attention.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.667
I'm not doing anything.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.869
The refrigerator's leaking,
i didn't notice.

02:16.871 --> 02:19.171
Can't you just fix it?

02:19.173 --> 02:20.439
Your father
gave you those tools.

02:22.408 --> 02:23.642
I have tools?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.910
Yes. From two christmases ago.

02:30.216 --> 02:32.284
"Not my chair,
not my problem."

02:32.286 --> 02:33.385
Is that what you say?

02:37.290 --> 02:38.457
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:45.832 --> 02:46.732
<i> Davis...</i>

02:50.603 --> 02:51.603
<i> Davis...</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:55.707
<i> She's gone.</i>

03:55.835 --> 03:58.337
The machine over there?
Uh, my candy's stuck.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.338
It happens sometimes.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.542
Do you have a key or something
we can open it up with?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.310
The machine doesn't belong
to the hospital.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.378
It's a vending company.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.433
<i> Davis, it's mom and dad.</i>

04:28.435 --> 04:30.836
<i> We tried your</i>
<i> cell phone but we...</i>

04:30.838 --> 04:32.804
<i> We can't get a hold</i>
<i> of you, and then...</i>

04:32.806 --> 04:34.740
<i> Oh, honey...</i>

04:34.742 --> 04:35.674
<i> We're... we're coming, son.</i>

04:37.411 --> 04:39.611
<i> You have one saved message.</i>

04:39.613 --> 04:41.313
<i> Hey, it's me,</i>
<i> your mailbox was full.</i>

04:41.315 --> 04:43.348
<i> There's supposed to be</i>
<i> a package delivered,</i>

04:43.350 --> 04:45.384
<i> so if you beat me home,</i>
<i> answer the doorbell, okay?</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:46.451
<i> Love.</i>

05:17.383 --> 05:19.551
Oh, honey...

05:53.353 --> 05:54.686
- Yeah! Again! Again!
- Again?

06:43.870 --> 06:46.405
<i> Dear champion</i>
<i> vending company, comma.</i>

06:46.407 --> 06:46.405
<i> This letter is in regards to</i>

06:46.407 --> 06:50.075
<i> a poor vending experience</i>
<i> at St. Andre's...</i>

06:50.077 --> 06:51.710
<i> No, wait.</i>

06:51.712 --> 06:54.513
<i> In regards to</i>
<i> vending machine number 714</i>

06:54.515 --> 06:56.047
<i> located in</i>
<i> the intensive care unit</i>

06:56.049 --> 06:58.049
<i> of Saint Andre's hospital.</i>

06:58.051 --> 06:59.785
<i> I put five quarters</i>
<i> in the machine,</i>

06:59.787 --> 07:01.853
<i> and proceeded to push b2,</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:03.889
<i> which should've given me</i>
<i> the peanut M&M's, period.</i>

07:04.690 --> 07:06.992
<i> Regrettably, it did not.</i>

07:06.994 --> 07:10.762
<i> I found this upsetting</i>
<i> as I was very hungry.</i>

07:10.764 --> 07:12.564
<i> And also, my wife had died</i>
<i> 10 minutes earlier.</i>

07:16.869 --> 07:18.203
<i> I'm not saying</i>
<i> that was your fault.</i>

07:18.205 --> 07:19.838
<i> We were in a car accident.</i>

07:19.840 --> 07:22.073
<i> Remarkably,</i>
<i> I escaped without a scratch.</i>

07:22.075 --> 07:24.042
<i> I'm not trying to</i>
<i> dramatize my claim,</i>

07:24.044 --> 07:25.844
<i> I just wanna be thorough.</i>

07:25.846 --> 07:26.945
<i> Maybe I should start</i>
<i> from the beginning.</i>

07:29.616 --> 07:31.716
<i> I get up every</i>
<i> morning at 5:30.</i>

07:31.718 --> 07:31.716
<i> I work in the markets</i>

07:31.718 --> 07:33.852
<i> so it's important</i>
<i> to get an early start.</i>

07:33.854 --> 07:37.189
<i> Not to imply that it's</i>
<i> any more important than, say,</i>

07:37.191 --> 07:39.658
<i> a Baker or a toll collector.</i>

07:41.194 --> 07:43.094
<i> Those are fine,</i>
<i> respectable jobs.</i>

07:44.197 --> 07:45.730
<i> I just mean that I commute.</i>

07:47.100 --> 07:48.800
<i> I catch the 7:15</i>
<i> out of white plains.</i>

07:48.802 --> 07:50.936
<i> It's pretty much the same</i>
<i> crowd during the week.</i>

07:50.938 --> 07:52.938
<i> John works the ground crew</i>
<i> at yankee stadium.</i>

07:52.940 --> 07:54.172
<i> The first time we met,</i>
<i> he asked what I did,</i>

07:54.174 --> 07:55.574
<i> and I told him...</i>

07:55.576 --> 07:56.842
Uh, retail mattresses.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.912
Retail mattresses?
That's amazing...

08:00.914 --> 08:02.914
<i> I don't know why.</i>
<i> It just popped into my head.</i>

08:04.217 --> 08:05.750
<i> I avoided him</i>
<i> after that 'cause</i>

08:05.752 --> 08:07.786
<i> I couldn't stand</i>
<i> his hot coffee breath.</i>

08:07.788 --> 08:08.720
Excuse me...

08:09.222 --> 08:10.155
<i> I think he knew.</i>

08:11.891 --> 08:13.158
<i> I never thought I'd</i>
<i> be one of those people</i>

08:13.160 --> 08:14.893
<i> who carried a briefcase.</i>

08:14.895 --> 08:16.094
<i> It always reminds me of</i>

08:16.096 --> 08:16.995
<i> carrying a lunch box</i>
<i> to school.</i>

08:18.197 --> 08:19.231
<i> Do they still make those?</i>

08:19.999 --> 08:21.233
Mister Mitchell.

08:21.235 --> 08:23.068
Morning.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.836
<i> Julia's father is</i>
<i> a founding partner</i>

08:24.838 --> 08:26.738
<i> at the investment firm</i>
<i> I work at.</i>

08:26.740 --> 08:29.241
<i> Nepotism in its truest form.</i>

08:29.243 --> 08:30.842
<i> He started grooming me</i>
<i> when I was 27.</i>

08:33.746 --> 08:34.645
<i> I hate that word.</i>

08:36.515 --> 08:37.982
<i> Monkeys groom.</i>

08:37.985 --> 08:40.118
Wavin' at you from over here.
Can you see me, buddy?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.620
<i> It's a small firm,</i>

08:41.621 --> 08:42.854
<i> but we handle</i>
<i> quite a bit of money.</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:42.854
<i> I don't wanna say how much,</i>

08:42.856 --> 08:45.657
<i> 'cause I think</i>
<i> it would be inappropriate.</i>

08:45.659 --> 08:46.925
Just look over
where the money is.

08:46.927 --> 08:47.893
<i> Okay, it's $6 billion.</i>

08:47.895 --> 08:51.162
<i> Emerging markets,</i>
<i> infrastructure,</i>

08:51.164 --> 08:53.198
<i> power plants,</i>
<i> telecom, seaworld,</i>

08:53.200 --> 08:55.000
<i> windshield wipers...</i>
Mmm-hmm.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.602
<i> You name it.</i>
<i> Doesn't matter what industry.</i>

08:57.604 --> 08:58.970
<i> We buy 'em cheap,</i>
<i> and we sell it for a bundle.</i>

08:58.972 --> 09:00.872
<i> But none of it's real.</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:01.940
<i> Nothing to hold in my hands.</i>

09:01.942 --> 09:03.775
<i> It's all just numbers.</i>

09:03.777 --> 09:05.043
<i> Computer codes</i>
<i> being transferred</i>

09:05.045 --> 09:06.011
<i> electronically</i>
<i> through the air.</i>

09:06.913 --> 09:08.713
<i> Right in front of us.</i>

09:08.715 --> 09:10.715
<i> The French poet,</i>
<i> Paul valery,</i>

09:10.717 --> 09:12.651
<i> was right when he said,</i>

09:12.653 --> 09:14.586
<i> "the future isn't</i>
<i> what it used to be."</i>

09:14.588 --> 09:16.688
<i> Phil Eastwood.</i>
<i> My father-in-law.</i>

09:16.690 --> 09:19.558
<i> F-i-l. Phil.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:21.893
<i> I think</i>
<i> the acronym is hysterical.</i>

09:21.895 --> 09:23.795
<i> I know Phil is</i>
<i> spelled with a p-h,</i>

09:23.797 --> 09:25.230
<i> but it still makes</i>
<i> me laugh in my head.</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:26.598
Davis.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.799
Bullshit.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.768
<i> I met Julia at a party.</i>

09:29.770 --> 09:30.635
<i> Who put</i>
<i> that goddamn chair there?</i>

09:30.637 --> 09:32.137
<i> Not my chair...</i>

09:32.139 --> 09:34.906
<i> Not my chair, not my problem,</i>
<i> that's what I say.</i>

09:34.908 --> 09:37.242
<i> A mutual friend said</i>
<i> she thought I was hot.</i>

09:37.244 --> 09:37.242
<i> I returned the compliment.</i>

09:37.244 --> 09:40.979
<i> ...i like things with</i>
<i> seashells and seahorses</i>

09:40.981 --> 09:43.148
<i> on 'em,</i>
<i> like blankets and towels...</i>

09:43.150 --> 09:45.050
<i> We had sex about</i>
<i> three hours later.</i>

09:45.885 --> 09:46.751
Forever...

09:50.690 --> 09:51.590
Forever...

09:59.231 --> 10:01.066
<i> I don't think Phil</i>
<i> liked me that much at first.</i>

10:02.668 --> 10:02.667
<i> I grew up in Jersey.</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:07.606
<i> I didn't come from money.</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:08.740
<i> And I puked</i>
<i> on the ice sculpture</i>

10:08.742 --> 10:09.374
<i> at our engagement party.</i>

10:11.110 --> 10:12.677
<i> Also, he told me once...</i>

10:12.679 --> 10:12.677
I don't like you, Davis.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.118
<i> Julia was a nice girl.</i>
<i> A good person.</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:22.087
<i> She worked with</i>
<i> special needs children,</i>

10:22.089 --> 10:23.955
<i> she snorted when she laughed</i>

10:23.957 --> 10:25.223
<i> and cried every time</i>
<i> they showed</i>

10:25.225 --> 10:26.958
<i> footage of the towers falling.</i>

10:26.960 --> 10:28.860
<i> Other than that,</i>

10:28.862 --> 10:30.762
<i> I don't think I knew</i>
<i> who she really was.</i>

10:31.864 --> 10:32.964
<i> She always said</i>
<i> I didn't pay attention.</i>

10:39.873 --> 10:41.806
<i> Perhaps you'll find</i>
<i> this information irrelevant</i>

10:41.808 --> 10:44.342
<i> in your deliberation</i>
<i> of my refund,</i>

10:44.344 --> 10:45.710
<i> but I think you deserve</i>
<i> the whole story.</i>

10:46.879 --> 10:49.247
<i> Sincerely, Davis c. Mitchell.</i>

11:00.693 --> 11:01.426
You okay?

11:45.304 --> 11:46.705
Morning.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.475
Morning, Amy. Is that me?

11:51.310 --> 11:52.877
Yeah... that's it.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.279
Great. Put this in
the outgoing mail?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.380
It's important.

12:05.424 --> 12:05.423
I, um...

12:08.160 --> 12:09.861
I didn't think you
were coming in today,

12:09.863 --> 12:11.229
they said you weren't...

12:12.832 --> 12:15.500
I am so sorry, Davis.

12:19.238 --> 12:19.237
Thank you, Amy.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.209
When you get a minute,
can I get the revenue numbers

12:24.211 --> 12:25.910
on alderman international?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.979
And can you push
my lunch with Bob rice?

12:27.981 --> 12:28.880
I got a lot of
catching up to do.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.082
Yeah...

12:50.870 --> 12:52.337
I handed you people

12:52.339 --> 12:54.105
a billion dollars' worth
of committed capital

12:54.107 --> 12:56.307
and all you can give me
is 150 million dollars'

12:56.309 --> 12:58.476
worth of
companies to buy.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.246
Doesn't anyone like to shop?
Should I call my mother?

13:03.916 --> 13:04.916
Phil.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.524
They called the house.
Told me you were up here.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.425
They did? Okay.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.394
I talked to Clayton brown
this morning.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.163
And I think I talked him
off the ledge on that thing.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.065
Look, why don't we
go grab a drink?

13:21.067 --> 13:23.201
I'm buried, Phil.
Two weeks out from lightyear,

13:23.203 --> 13:24.269
and I gotta get
some momentum going.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.571
Davis, let's grab a drink.

13:33.112 --> 13:34.946
You know,
the cocktails run

13:34.948 --> 13:36.548
about 18 bucks a pop here.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.084
I don't get it.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.455
We haven't
really talked, Davis.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.423
Not since... everything.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.828
I loved Julia.

13:52.965 --> 13:54.432
So much.

13:58.137 --> 13:59.103
It's a father's love.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.576
A man loses his wife,
he's a widower.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.316
A child loses a parent,
they're an orphan.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.120
But losing a child...

14:17.289 --> 14:19.190
There's no word for this.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.860
And there shouldn't be.

14:26.265 --> 14:27.265
But you...

14:30.970 --> 14:33.137
You and I have to continue on.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.111
I want you to know
you've been a value to me,

14:40.113 --> 14:42.881
and not just in business,
but in my life.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.883
And, uh...

14:53.993 --> 14:56.027
You keep your emotions
close to the vest,

14:56.029 --> 14:57.228
that's good, that's strong.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.099
I do the same.

15:02.001 --> 15:02.667
It's the atmosphere.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.605
What?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.073
That's why the drinks
are so expensive.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.141
You're paying
for the atmosphere.

15:10.143 --> 15:10.975
It just occurred to me.

15:18.984 --> 15:22.053
Davis, listen,
there's some other business

15:22.055 --> 15:23.454
that needs looking after.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.989
It's the insurance policy.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.092
I'd like to take her money

15:28.094 --> 15:30.561
and start a foundation
in Julia's name.

15:31.497 --> 15:32.430
Foundation...

15:36.135 --> 15:37.268
<i> A merit-based scholarship</i>

15:37.270 --> 15:38.970
<i> awarded annually</i>

15:38.972 --> 15:40.338
<i> to one student</i>
<i> who's most deserving.</i>

15:42.541 --> 15:43.541
<i> How much</i>
<i> are we talking about?</i>

15:45.144 --> 15:46.210
<i> About 2.6.</i>

15:49.048 --> 15:50.148
<i> Steven's gonna get</i>
<i> the ball rolling.</i>

15:51.583 --> 15:52.684
This'll be her legacy.

15:53.452 --> 15:54.419
Legacy...

16:03.162 --> 16:04.696
<i> Dear</i>
<i> champion vending company.</i>

16:04.698 --> 16:07.498
<i> This is Davis Mitchell. Again.</i>

16:07.500 --> 16:08.700
<i> There have been some</i>
<i> recent developments</i>

16:08.702 --> 16:10.335
<i> in my claim for reimbursement,</i>

16:10.337 --> 16:11.569
<i> and I'd like to</i>
<i> represent myself</i>

16:11.571 --> 16:12.737
<i> as accurately as possible.</i>

16:12.739 --> 16:12.737
Dinner's ready, son.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.673
<i> First,</i>
<i> there was a strange package</i>

16:15.675 --> 16:16.741
<i> blocking my garage.</i>

16:16.743 --> 16:18.209
Mom?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.444
I think it's
a cappuccino machine.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.212
I didn't order
a cappuccino machine.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.749
It was in Julia's name.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.421
<i> Then, my dad was</i>
<i> fertilizing the lawn</i>

16:30.423 --> 16:31.622
<i> at 7:00 in the morning.</i>

16:31.624 --> 16:32.757
Dad! What are you doing?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.392
It's the season, Davis.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.227
You should do this.
You need to.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.462
Get the soil ready.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.097
I have someone for that.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.765
Do they know
about gypsy moths?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.667
What?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.670
Gypsy moths.
They'll destroy your trees.

16:45.672 --> 16:45.670
It starts as a caterpillar.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.141
They eat the leaves,
lay eggs...

16:50.143 --> 16:52.143
And they're coming here,
to this neighborhood?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.411
Well,
they don't know for sure,

16:53.413 --> 16:54.278
but you should tell
your guy to spray.

16:54.280 --> 16:54.278
<i> And of course,</i>
<i> the train incident...</i>

16:58.684 --> 16:59.684
I feel like I should
tell you something.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.454
Um, I'm in finance.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.192
I don't know why I told you

17:08.194 --> 17:09.460
that I worked in
the mattress business.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.795
I guess I didn't
expect to see you

17:10.797 --> 17:12.230
every day for five years.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.766
You think I'm a dick.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.606
I don't work for
the Yankees anymore.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.276
Got fired over
a drainage issue

17:25.278 --> 17:26.210
in the visitors' bullpen.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.382
I work security now
at parade of shoes in midtown.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.655
Fuckin' job. Excuse me.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.526
My little prick of a boss.
He's 30 years younger than me.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.528
I just wanna go in there

17:43.530 --> 17:44.262
and smash
his little prick face.

17:48.300 --> 17:49.634
Jeez.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.668
I didn't love my wife.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.110
I know, it's sad...
It's sad to say,

18:00.479 --> 18:01.813
but now that she's gone,

18:01.815 --> 18:04.415
I don't even feel sad
or pain or hurt, or...

18:07.519 --> 18:08.419
Well, what do you feel?

18:10.355 --> 18:10.855
<i> I couldn't tell you</i>
<i> why I did it.</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:20.164
So that's when you pulled it.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.466
<i> Maybe because</i>
<i> I was finally being honest.</i>

18:21.468 --> 18:22.433
Yes.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.671
And you knew that would
stop the train, correct?

18:26.673 --> 18:30.541
Well, I wasn't positive,
but I was hoping.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.876
<i> All I can say is,</i>

18:31.878 --> 18:33.177
<i> it felt like</i>
<i> a legitimate emergency.</i>

18:37.483 --> 18:38.583
His wife just died.

18:46.525 --> 18:47.892
Davis, maybe you should

18:47.894 --> 18:49.360
come stay with us for a while.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.262
Take it easy.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.164
We have the extra room.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.566
I could sure use help
putting that gazebo together.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.868
How's that sound?

19:33.272 --> 19:34.939
Remember
to tell your guy to spray.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.511
<i> Hello again,</i>
<i> it's Davis Mitchell.</i>

19:42.381 --> 19:44.415
<i> My parents left</i>
<i> for tampa this afternoon,</i>

19:44.417 --> 19:46.551
<i> and I stayed at the airport</i>
<i> an extra two hours</i>

19:46.553 --> 19:47.919
<i> watching people</i>
<i> walk back and forth</i>

19:47.921 --> 19:48.920
<i> with their luggage in tow.</i>

19:51.491 --> 19:54.258
<i> I find I'm suddenly</i>
<i> filled with... wait...</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:57.328
<i> Overwhelmed by...</i>

19:58.697 --> 20:02.266
<i> A growing sense</i>
<i> of curiosity...</i>

20:07.506 --> 20:08.706
<i> What are in these bags?</i>

20:10.375 --> 20:10.374
<i> I wanna know what these people</i>

20:10.376 --> 20:13.744
<i> can't do without</i>
<i> for four days in buffalo.</i>

20:15.514 --> 20:17.982
<i> I wanna go through</i>
<i> every one of them</i>

20:17.984 --> 20:20.685
<i> and dump their shit</i>
<i> in a huge pile.</i>

20:24.790 --> 20:27.425
<i> And the national guard guy?</i>
<i> I wanna hold his gun.</i>

20:31.330 --> 20:32.396
<i> I wanna protect my country.</i>

20:42.675 --> 20:44.475
<i> I'm starting to notice things</i>
<i> I never saw before.</i>

20:50.515 --> 20:51.482
<i> Well...</i>

20:53.018 --> 20:54.285
<i> Maybe I saw them.</i>

20:55.754 --> 20:57.421
<i> I just wasn't</i>
<i> paying attention.</i>

21:02.995 --> 21:04.295
<i> For some reason,</i>

21:06.832 --> 21:08.833
<i> everything has become</i>
<i> a metaphor.</i>

21:11.503 --> 21:12.336
Metaphor...

21:15.474 --> 21:16.340
<i> Metaphor...</i>

21:17.943 --> 21:19.877
<i> I am the uprooted tree.</i>
<i> No, wait...</i>

21:20.979 --> 21:22.346
<i> I am the storm</i>
<i> that uprooted the tree.</i>

21:24.416 --> 21:25.950
<i> I am the cold front</i>

21:25.952 --> 21:28.486
<i> that collided with</i>
<i> the low-pressure system.</i>

21:29.688 --> 21:31.289
<i> Too much.</i>

21:52.711 --> 21:53.911
Morning, Amy.
Put a stamp on that?

22:02.321 --> 22:05.323
<i> There's something else,</i>
<i> dearest vending company.</i>

22:05.325 --> 22:06.624
<i> It's been scratching</i>
<i> at the inside of my head.</i>

22:18.036 --> 22:19.003
<i> I couldn't take it</i>
<i> one second longer.</i>

22:21.039 --> 22:23.507
<i> The goddamn refrigerator</i>
<i> was leaking.</i>

22:26.712 --> 22:26.711
<i> Now, I wouldn't say</i>
<i> I'm handy by any means.</i>

22:29.948 --> 22:31.716
<i> Mechanically retarded</i>
<i> would be closer to the truth.</i>

22:32.951 --> 22:33.918
<i> But Phil said it himself,</i>

22:35.087 --> 22:36.487
<i> "if you wanna</i>
<i> fix something..."</i>

22:36.489 --> 22:38.956
You have to take
everything apart...

22:38.958 --> 22:40.658
<i> "...and figure out</i>
<i> what's important."</i>

22:40.660 --> 22:41.892
What'll make you stronger.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.700
<i> Repairing the human heart</i>

22:49.702 --> 22:52.002
<i> is like repairing</i>
<i> an automobile.</i>

22:52.004 --> 22:53.838
<i> Just examine everything.</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:57.842
<i> Then you can put it</i>
<i> all back together.</i>

23:10.122 --> 23:11.722
<i> Put it all back together...</i>

23:12.891 --> 23:13.858
<i> Hmm.</i>

23:22.567 --> 23:24.001
Hello?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.936
<i> Hello.</i>
<i> Mr. Davis Mitchell?</i>

23:25.938 --> 23:26.904
Yes?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.673
<i> This is Karen moreno</i>

23:29.675 --> 23:31.909
<i> from champion vending company.</i>

23:31.911 --> 23:33.511
<i> I'm with customer service.</i>

23:35.147 --> 23:36.147
Yeah?

23:37.549 --> 23:38.949
<i> I'm calling in regards</i>

23:38.951 --> 23:39.850
<i> to your complaint letters,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

23:42.020 --> 23:43.020
<i> There's been four so far.</i>

23:47.859 --> 23:49.627
You're with the customer
service department?

23:50.962 --> 23:53.798
<i> Yes, sir. I am the customer</i>
<i> service department.</i>

23:53.800 --> 23:55.766
<i> It's just me.</i>

23:55.768 --> 23:58.536
Do you usually make service
calls at 2:00 in the morning?

23:58.538 --> 24:01.639
<i> No. Not really. Never.</i>

24:01.641 --> 24:03.507
<i> I... I apologize</i>
<i> for the inconvenience.</i>

24:04.476 --> 24:05.943
I was just venting.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.945
I didn't expect anybody
to read them. Sorry if...

24:07.947 --> 24:09.046
<i> Your letters made me cry,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

24:12.050 --> 24:13.617
<i> Do you have anyone to talk to?</i>

24:17.522 --> 24:20.524
<i> I... I'm gonna submit your</i>
<i> claim to management.</i>

24:20.526 --> 24:21.792
<i> In the meantime is</i>
<i> there something else</i>

24:21.794 --> 24:24.562
<i> I can do for you,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell?</i>

24:24.564 --> 24:27.064
Wait, wait. Karen moreno,
that's your name?

24:27.066 --> 24:30.534
<i> This is weird. I...</i>
<i> I shouldn't have called.</i>

24:30.536 --> 24:33.237
<i> I... I'm going to contact you</i>
<i> at a more reasonable hour.</i>

24:33.239 --> 24:36.106
<i> I'm sorry again,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

24:36.108 --> 24:38.843
<i> This is so unprofessional.</i>

24:38.845 --> 24:40.244
Customer service
is a profession?

25:00.532 --> 25:04.568
Some people
wallow through their grief.

25:04.570 --> 25:06.136
My wife, she cooks.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.574
This is delicious, margot,
what is it?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.144
Did Julia tell you
what we were fighting about?

25:18.917 --> 25:22.086
I bought her these bath towels
and she didn't like 'em,

25:22.088 --> 25:24.555
so she took 'em back
without telling me.

25:24.557 --> 25:28.526
And we hadn't spoken
for three days.

25:33.798 --> 25:34.932
I'm sorry.

25:34.934 --> 25:35.866
Excuse me.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.007
Hi, Karen.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.008
<i> How did you know it was me?</i>

25:45.710 --> 25:48.012
I have you programmed
into my phone.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.748
<i> Oh, I see. I'm not sure</i>
<i> how I feel about that.</i>

25:52.884 --> 25:54.618
<i> There's something else</i>
<i> I wanted to bring</i>

25:54.620 --> 25:56.020
<i> to your attention</i>
<i> regarding your claim.</i>

25:56.022 --> 25:57.721
Okay.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.758
<i> During our previous</i>
<i> conversation,</i>

26:00.760 --> 26:04.562
<i> you implied that my job</i>
<i> wasn't a profession.</i>

26:04.564 --> 26:07.898
Oh, well... I'm sorry,
i didn't mean it as an insult.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.334
<i> I know. But it made me think,</i>

26:10.336 --> 26:12.603
<i> and I concluded that</i>
<i> you might be right.</i>

26:15.206 --> 26:16.173
God bless con ed.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.642
And there was light!

26:18.644 --> 26:21.145
Yeah. I've gotta go.
Thank you for dinner.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.181
Really?

26:28.053 --> 26:29.920
<i> "Moreno" means brown</i>
<i> in Spanish, did you know that?</i>

26:30.889 --> 26:32.256
<i> Yes, I did, of course.</i>

26:32.258 --> 26:33.857
<i> Do you have brown hair?</i>

26:33.859 --> 26:35.225
<i> No, it's blonde.</i>

26:37.629 --> 26:39.063
<i> Are you</i>
<i> of Spanish descent?</i>

26:39.065 --> 26:42.266
<i> No. Why do you ask?</i>

26:42.268 --> 26:44.335
<i> I'm just trying</i>
<i> to paint a mental picture.</i>

26:46.606 --> 26:49.239
Excuse me,
is Karen moreno here?

26:49.241 --> 26:50.708
Who?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.943
Blonde hair, Hazel eyes,

26:52.945 --> 26:54.678
but not hispanic like
her name suggests?

27:05.224 --> 27:06.090
Hi, where are you?

27:07.225 --> 27:09.994
<i> I was there, in the diner.</i>

27:09.996 --> 27:11.996
<i> I sat in a booth</i>
<i> for a few minutes.</i>

27:11.998 --> 27:13.731
<i> I even played a song</i>

27:13.733 --> 27:15.766
<i> on the little baby jukebox,</i>
<i> and then...</i>

27:15.768 --> 27:17.801
<i> I dunno, I got sad, so I left.</i>

27:18.637 --> 27:19.403
Oh.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.072
What song did you play?

27:22.874 --> 27:24.341
Crazy on you, <i> by heart.</i>

27:26.011 --> 27:27.077
That made you sad?

27:27.912 --> 27:28.946
<i> Not so much the song.</i>

27:30.215 --> 27:31.248
<i> How are your pancakes?</i>

27:33.151 --> 27:34.918
<i> Oh, I...</i>
<i> I'm in the parking lot.</i>

27:34.920 --> 27:35.953
What?

27:40.992 --> 27:42.292
You're a smoker.

27:43.361 --> 27:46.397
<i> It's cannabis.</i>
<i> I have a prescription.</i>

27:47.899 --> 27:48.832
Oh.

27:49.801 --> 27:50.734
Okay.

27:50.736 --> 27:52.970
<i> You look younger</i>
<i> than I expected.</i>

27:54.439 --> 27:54.438
Do you think
you could come inside?

27:57.275 --> 27:59.410
<i> Oh, well, it's just that...</i>

27:59.412 --> 28:02.079
<i> I have this nice image of you</i>

28:02.081 --> 28:04.281
<i> sitting there in the window</i>
<i> eating pancakes.</i>

28:04.283 --> 28:06.950
<i> Maybe that's all it's supposed</i>
<i> to be, ya know?</i>

28:06.952 --> 28:09.286
Yeah, but my image of you is

28:09.288 --> 28:12.456
a shadowy figure
smoking pot in a corolla.

28:14.159 --> 28:17.094
<i> You know what? I should go.</i>
<i> Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go.</i>

28:17.096 --> 28:18.195
No, no, no, wait. I have
another letter here for you.

28:19.097 --> 28:20.030
<i> Put it in the mail.</i>

28:21.266 --> 28:22.399
I think it's for real, Phil.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.400
If their
second quarter earnings

28:23.402 --> 28:24.968
are an indication of growth,

28:24.970 --> 28:26.103
even just two
or three percent,

28:26.105 --> 28:27.304
then it's a risk worth taking.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.405
Davis, do you need some paper?

28:30.709 --> 28:31.775
Is there something
you'd like to

28:31.777 --> 28:32.810
contribute to the discussion?

28:37.015 --> 28:40.117
Yes, actually.
But it's more of a question.

28:40.119 --> 28:42.319
Would any of you consider
<i> crazy on you</i> to be a sad song?

28:45.423 --> 28:47.124
And that's from, you know,
assuming

28:47.126 --> 28:48.058
that you're familiar with
the heart catalog.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.410
<i> Going down.</i>

30:14.445 --> 30:16.547
Can I help you? Hi.

30:16.549 --> 30:18.482
Oh, yeah.
I'm looking for Karen.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.184
I'm sorry, who are you?

30:20.186 --> 30:23.887
I'm Davis. I have a...

30:23.889 --> 30:25.322
Customer service issue.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.191
Oh, I'm Carl.
This is my company.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.058
What's the problem?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.028
I really can't
get into it, Carl.

30:33.865 --> 30:35.566
There's way too much
ground to cover.

30:35.568 --> 30:36.934
But thanks for your concern.

30:42.574 --> 30:45.209
<i> Did you get</i>
<i> the foundation proposal?</i>

30:45.211 --> 30:47.578
<i> I'm gonna need you to sign off</i>
<i> before we move forward.</i>

30:50.081 --> 30:52.883
Listen, have you thought about
talking to someone?

30:55.086 --> 30:56.854
Professionally, I mean.

31:00.391 --> 31:01.925
I didn't go upside down!

31:08.066 --> 31:10.267
<i> Your father thinks</i>
<i> I'm losing my mind.</i>

31:15.640 --> 31:16.607
Hmm.

31:47.005 --> 31:47.671
<i> Hello?</i>

31:49.407 --> 31:52.009
I just dismantled
a $2,000 cappuccino machine.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.646
<i> Why did you call me,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell?</i>

31:55.648 --> 31:56.513
Why'd you answer?

32:00.051 --> 32:01.952
<i> There's something about</i>
<i> your letters.</i>

32:01.954 --> 32:03.253
<i> I'm re-reading one</i>
<i> right now in my tub.</i>

32:04.656 --> 32:08.292
<i> I'm not bathing or anything.</i>
<i> I just sit here.</i>

32:08.294 --> 32:11.929
<i> It's quiet, and I don't</i>
<i> wanna wake up my son.</i>

32:11.931 --> 32:13.597
<i> Did I mention I have a son?</i>

32:13.599 --> 32:15.032
No.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.466
<i> Yeah, he's 15.</i>

32:17.335 --> 32:20.003
<i> But looks 12 and acts 21.</i>

32:21.306 --> 32:24.574
<i> So bright, but he</i>
<i> scares the shit outta me.</i>

32:25.677 --> 32:27.144
<i> Karen...</i>

32:27.146 --> 32:28.278
<i> I... I have to go.</i>

32:29.314 --> 32:30.614
<i> You shouldn't have</i>

32:30.616 --> 32:32.482
<i> come to my office,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

32:32.484 --> 32:34.217
<i> This sets</i>
<i> a dangerous precedent.</i>

32:34.219 --> 32:35.152
Dangerous?

32:39.557 --> 32:42.059
<i> Dear Karen, is it okay</i>
<i> that I address you directly</i>

32:42.061 --> 32:43.427
<i> now that we've almost met?</i>

32:43.429 --> 32:44.294
<i> I'll assume so.</i>

32:45.330 --> 32:46.730
<i> I was on the train today,</i>

32:46.732 --> 32:48.699
<i> and I saw a woman</i>
<i> staring at me.</i>

32:50.568 --> 32:52.569
<i> There was something about her.</i>

32:52.571 --> 32:53.704
<i> So I went and</i>
<i> introduced myself.</i>

32:53.706 --> 32:54.671
Hi.

32:56.975 --> 32:57.708
Hello.

32:58.343 --> 32:59.309
I'm Davis.

33:01.612 --> 33:02.446
Do we know each other?

33:03.748 --> 33:04.715
No.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.554
I'm... I'm not trying
to pick you up or anything.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.589
I just... you look familiar.

33:23.468 --> 33:25.035
Is it okay... sorry, I...

33:29.607 --> 33:30.574
Tough day?

33:31.542 --> 33:33.076
No. Not really, no.

33:34.278 --> 33:36.179
My job isn't really
that difficult.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.514
It's the guys underneath me

33:37.516 --> 33:38.682
who do most
of the heavy lifting.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.351
I just take
all the credit for it.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.586
Wow.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.722
Most people
wouldn't admit that.

33:48.559 --> 33:50.227
I actually cheated my way

33:50.229 --> 33:51.695
through my last year
of college.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.697
I had this guy Edmond write
all my papers for me,

33:53.699 --> 33:55.432
and sometimes,
I'd give him ecstasy.

33:58.036 --> 33:58.035
You know...

33:58.037 --> 34:02.239
<i> She was quiet,</i>
<i> but for some reason,</i>

34:02.241 --> 34:03.340
<i> I wanted to tell her things.</i>

34:06.577 --> 34:08.512
<i> I found myself</i>
<i> mapping her face as I talked.</i>

34:11.248 --> 34:13.449
<i> Somehow, she got me talking</i>
<i> about my wife.</i>

34:15.053 --> 34:16.485
<i> I really let her in.</i>

34:18.188 --> 34:20.123
<i> Then, out of nowhere,</i>
<i> she asked...</i>

34:20.125 --> 34:21.358
So why'd you marry her?

34:24.795 --> 34:27.230
I dunno. 'Cause it was easy.

34:31.436 --> 34:32.402
Yeah...

34:33.504 --> 34:35.237
<i> Next stop, scarsdale.</i>

34:37.241 --> 34:38.074
<i> I wanted to ask her name...</i>

34:38.077 --> 34:39.409
This is me.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.143
<i> But she disappeared so quick.</i>

34:42.480 --> 34:43.746
<i> I spent the next 10 minutes</i>
<i> kicking myself.</i>

34:43.748 --> 34:45.514
"...the next 10 minutes
kicking myself."

34:45.516 --> 34:46.783
"What are the chances

34:46.784 --> 34:47.451
"I'd ever see
this woman again?"

34:49.587 --> 34:51.588
<i> "Fortunately, she left</i>
<i> her magazine on the seat."</i>

34:53.757 --> 34:55.525
<i> I think you know</i>
<i> who it was addressed to.</i>

34:55.527 --> 34:57.694
<i> And scarsdale ain't her stop.</i>

34:57.696 --> 35:00.230
<i> No more games, Karen.</i>
<i> I'll see you soon.</i>

35:21.319 --> 35:23.653
You. What are you doing here?

35:23.655 --> 35:25.655
I'm here to see Karen moreno.
What are you doing here?

35:25.657 --> 35:27.257
What am I doing here?

35:27.259 --> 35:29.126
Who the...
What the fuck do you want?

35:29.128 --> 35:30.760
Well...
You don't have to swear, Carl.

35:30.762 --> 35:31.728
I told you I have
a customer service issue.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.196
What...

35:33.198 --> 35:35.132
Carl, this is Davis Mitchell.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.366
Yeah, I was
supposed to call you.

35:36.368 --> 35:37.834
Hi, Karen.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.337
He, uh... he's having problems
with one of the machines.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.605
What machine?

35:41.607 --> 35:43.440
Uh, number 714,

35:43.442 --> 35:44.574
in the intensive care unit
at Saint Andre's.

35:45.476 --> 35:46.877
Second floor.

35:46.879 --> 35:48.512
You a doctor?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.347
No. I work in finance.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.781
Well, what...

35:51.783 --> 35:54.184
Carl. Honey.
I'll handle this.
It's okay.

35:54.186 --> 35:55.719
It's 11:00, Karen.

35:55.721 --> 35:57.187
Why the hell are you
at our house?

35:57.189 --> 35:59.222
It's my house, okay?

35:59.224 --> 36:00.891
Now go inside, or go home.
I'll handle this.

36:02.493 --> 36:03.627
It's okay. Come on.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.273
I was in the neighborhood.

36:18.409 --> 36:19.342
You shouldn't be here.

36:20.711 --> 36:22.279
You know what?
I... I'm with someone.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.347
Carl. We're together.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.518
I shouldn't have called you.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.554
And I shouldn't
have started following you.

36:30.556 --> 36:31.688
It's very unprofessional.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.762
What happened to you?
Your clothes...

36:41.899 --> 36:43.366
I wrote this
in the car 10 minutes ago.

36:45.970 --> 36:46.903
It's the last one.

37:21.839 --> 37:23.773
<i> Dear Karen. Fuck Phil.</i>

37:23.775 --> 37:24.808
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

37:28.312 --> 37:31.281
Nothing. I was supposed to
call him. We sorted it out.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.819
Are you having an affair
with this guy?

37:35.821 --> 37:39.990
No, I'm not.
He's lonely, I think.

37:39.992 --> 37:42.892
I don't know,
he's just a little... off.

37:52.737 --> 37:53.603
What time's your flight?

37:58.776 --> 38:00.977
It's a good-looking
city, Karen.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.612
And you could go
to tech school, like we...

38:02.614 --> 38:03.613
Like we talked about.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.684
I can...
I'll open up a new warehouse.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.886
Twice, two times
the square footage...

38:10.655 --> 38:12.322
And Chris, I mean...

38:12.324 --> 38:13.857
He's struggling here,
you know?

38:14.792 --> 38:15.759
A new start could be good.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.035
<i> Dear Karen. Fuck Phil.</i>

38:25.037 --> 38:27.003
<i> He called me</i>
<i> into his office...</i>

38:27.005 --> 38:28.405
I pulled the plug
on lightyear.

38:29.340 --> 38:30.607
What? Why?

38:30.609 --> 38:31.775
Gut feeling.

38:33.577 --> 38:36.479
To be honest, your judgment
of late has been questionable.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.582
Well... how so, Phil?

38:39.584 --> 38:40.817
Did you take apart
the lighting fixture

38:40.819 --> 38:41.818
in our bathroom?

38:47.325 --> 38:50.026
Yes. I did.

38:51.395 --> 38:52.429
And your computer?

38:54.899 --> 38:57.367
I assume you're responsible
for the washroom stall.

38:58.369 --> 38:59.436
That was my work, yes.

39:00.671 --> 39:01.705
Why?

39:04.108 --> 39:06.042
Well, that's a little
harder to answer.

39:06.044 --> 39:08.078
Mmm-hmm. Try me.

39:11.615 --> 39:13.016
The bathroom stall,
for example?

39:16.354 --> 39:18.021
The door was squeaking.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.589
And it had probably been that
way for quite some time.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.458
I just never noticed.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.592
And now, I'm noticing

39:22.594 --> 39:23.626
all different kinds
of things, Phil,

39:23.628 --> 39:27.464
and I wanna see how they work.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.398
Like that clock.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.502
Pure craftsmanship. Artistry!

39:32.504 --> 39:34.838
That belonged to my
great-grandmother. 1890s.

39:35.706 --> 39:38.541
I wanna rip it apart and

39:38.543 --> 39:41.444
spread it out
all over the floor.

39:43.147 --> 39:44.814
And no offense to
your great-grandmother,

39:44.816 --> 39:46.082
but I see a clock like that,

39:46.084 --> 39:47.851
and I wanna know
what it looks like inside.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.126
Mmm.

40:02.099 --> 40:03.032
Davis.
Mmm.

40:05.503 --> 40:06.970
I want you to
take some time off.

40:06.972 --> 40:06.970
<i> Fuck him,</i>

40:06.972 --> 40:09.572
<i> and the way he leans</i>
<i> on the corner of his desk</i>

40:09.574 --> 40:09.572
<i> with his sleeves rolled up</i>

40:09.574 --> 40:11.574
<i> like he's about</i>
<i> to dig a ditch.</i>

40:12.978 --> 40:15.545
<i> No more imaginary</i>
<i> office ditches, Karen.</i>

40:15.547 --> 40:18.114
<i> From now on,</i>
<i> it's me and my tools.</i>

40:19.083 --> 40:20.950
<i> I intended to drive home</i>

40:20.952 --> 40:22.619
<i> but accidentally turned</i>
<i> for the midtown tunnel.</i>

40:22.621 --> 40:24.120
Ruby drive...

40:24.122 --> 40:26.489
<i> Maybe there are no accidents.</i>

40:26.491 --> 40:29.926
<i> Anyway, it seemed like a good</i>
<i> time to come and look for you.</i>

40:29.928 --> 40:31.928
<i> Turn left on crystal Avenue.</i>

40:31.930 --> 40:33.463
<i> I knew I was getting close</i>

40:33.465 --> 40:35.465
<i> when I found myself</i>
<i> in a neighborhood</i>

40:35.467 --> 40:37.200
<i> where all the streets were</i>
<i> named after precious stones.</i>

40:38.502 --> 40:39.636
<i> And that's when I saw it.</i>

40:41.605 --> 40:42.806
Hey! You the insurance guy?

40:43.574 --> 40:45.775
Oh, no. Not me.

40:45.777 --> 40:46.776
I thought... you know,
i just saw the suit,

40:46.778 --> 40:47.877
so I figured, you know...

40:47.879 --> 40:49.512
Yeah, I was just driving by,

40:49.514 --> 40:52.015
and I, uh, saw you guys
working. Looks like fun.

40:52.716 --> 40:53.850
Yeah, fun.

40:53.852 --> 40:54.818
Um...

40:55.920 --> 40:57.687
What exactly
are you doing here?

40:57.689 --> 40:58.688
Well, we gotta tear
the whole thing down

40:58.690 --> 40:59.656
before they rebuild.

41:02.493 --> 41:03.193
Can I, uh, help you out?

41:03.661 --> 41:05.028
What...

41:05.030 --> 41:06.729
I mean, you just, you know,
you just tell me

41:06.731 --> 41:07.997
what to do,
you don't have to pay me.

41:09.601 --> 41:12.035
Come on, pal, don't bust
my balls, all right?

41:12.037 --> 41:12.035
You're the insurance guy,
right?

41:12.037 --> 41:14.537
Barry sent you over here
to bust my balls?

41:14.539 --> 41:15.205
No, I don't know who Barry is.

41:16.006 --> 41:17.607
No, I... you know, I...

41:17.609 --> 41:19.509
Actually, you know,
I'll pay you, huh?

41:19.511 --> 41:22.045
How 'bout, uh, 50...
I'll give you 50 bucks.

41:22.047 --> 41:22.045
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What kinda shit

41:22.047 --> 41:22.045
you trying to pull here, pal?

41:22.047 --> 41:27.116
No, no, no, I'm not a cop.
I... I just wanna help.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.219
You know what, I'll...
You know, I'll give you, uh...

41:29.221 --> 41:31.821
I'll give you $241.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.523
Go on, take it.
I'll work hard.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.734
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.036
No, no. No, don't use that,
don't use that.

41:47.038 --> 41:50.073
Here. Put these on,
use this...

41:50.075 --> 41:51.107
Now knock the wall down.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.838
This guy's a fuckin' animal.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.773
He's probably a crackhead.

42:23.775 --> 42:25.642
Crackheads don't
give people $200.

42:25.644 --> 42:27.744
They suck dick for $20.

42:27.746 --> 42:29.012
I mean, you should know.

43:11.590 --> 43:14.857
Yeah, don't ask,
it's embarrassing.

43:14.859 --> 43:17.927
I, uh, closed the car door
on my jacket,

43:17.929 --> 43:20.029
and your sprinklers turned on.

43:20.864 --> 43:23.232
<i> Then, the stupid lock...</i>

43:23.234 --> 43:25.635
It sometimes gets stuck...
I couldn't...

43:25.637 --> 43:26.703
You're high, aren't you?

43:27.871 --> 43:28.805
A little bit...

43:34.778 --> 43:35.812
D'you want some
grilled cheese?

43:40.084 --> 43:42.285
I needed some work overalls.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.320
I guess I got a little carried
away at the army surplus.

43:47.758 --> 43:49.359
Your whole house is just

43:51.228 --> 43:52.895
lovely.

43:52.897 --> 43:55.031
Aside from the appliances,

43:55.033 --> 43:56.833
it's the kind of house
people dream of living in.

43:56.835 --> 43:57.700
I hate this house.

43:59.703 --> 44:01.070
It's just shiny stuff.

44:27.731 --> 44:30.933
I can't have sex with you.
It'd be dangerous.

44:30.935 --> 44:31.868
There's that word again.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.271
Is Carl really out of town,

44:35.273 --> 44:36.773
or did you just chop him up
into little pieces

44:36.775 --> 44:38.274
and stuff him
in your sock drawer?

44:38.276 --> 44:41.744
That's ridiculous.
I don't have a sock drawer.

44:41.746 --> 44:44.313
Well... where do you
keep all your socks?

44:44.315 --> 44:45.848
In the same drawer
as my underwear.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.186
What?

44:52.323 --> 44:56.325
I just...
You know, I just think

44:56.327 --> 44:59.896
a woman's underwear
is deserving of its own space.

45:08.439 --> 45:09.472
This is all I can handle.

45:10.140 --> 45:11.040
That's fine.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.877
Let's just
fall asleep together.

45:15.846 --> 45:17.280
Together?

45:17.282 --> 45:18.414
Together apart.

45:25.055 --> 45:26.222
I'm not in love with Carl,
you know.

45:28.292 --> 45:29.892
He's a good man. He really is.

45:32.162 --> 45:35.198
He loves me.
Probably more than he should.

45:39.069 --> 45:41.471
But I dunno...

45:48.278 --> 45:50.813
I'd like to be
able to do what you do.

45:50.815 --> 45:52.348
To be completely honest.

45:54.852 --> 45:56.052
I think you just were.

45:58.789 --> 45:59.989
Not even close.

46:26.216 --> 46:27.116
You must be Chris.

46:29.052 --> 46:29.886
You fuckin' my mom?

46:32.356 --> 46:34.557
No, I'm not.
We were just sleeping...

46:34.559 --> 46:36.926
She's fuckin' crazy.

46:36.928 --> 46:40.096
If you haven't noticed,
she's a fuckin' pot head.

46:40.098 --> 46:41.430
She calls it cannabis
'cause it makes her

46:41.432 --> 46:43.065
feel like less of
a fuckin' pothead.

46:43.067 --> 46:44.300
You say "fuck" a lot.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.202
So?

46:46.204 --> 46:47.370
So you're just
not using it properly.

46:49.072 --> 46:49.872
The fuck does that mean?

46:51.408 --> 46:52.308
That's what I mean.

46:53.143 --> 46:55.011
"Fuck" is a great word,

46:55.013 --> 46:57.413
but if you use it too much,
then it just loses its value.

46:58.215 --> 46:59.148
And you sound stupid.

46:59.917 --> 47:00.917
Fuck you.

47:00.919 --> 47:03.052
Exactly.

47:03.054 --> 47:05.054
I feel nothing,
and you sound like an idiot.

47:05.056 --> 47:05.922
Have a good one!

47:06.523 --> 47:07.423
Who the...

47:14.965 --> 47:16.866
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> You've reached Davis Mitchell.</i>

47:16.868 --> 47:19.836
<i> I'm unavailable at the moment,</i>
<i> so please leave a message.</i>

47:19.838 --> 47:21.904
<i> If you're looking for Julia,</i>

47:21.906 --> 47:25.041
<i> I regret to inform you that</i>
<i> she isn't with us anymore,</i>

47:25.043 --> 47:26.609
<i> which makes her</i>
<i> also unavailable.</i>

47:28.379 --> 47:31.214
<i> Davis,</i>
<i> you've taken things too far.</i>

47:31.216 --> 47:34.450
<i> I am deeply concerned</i>
<i> with your well-being.</i>

47:34.452 --> 47:36.552
<i> I'm trying to</i>
<i> reach out to you,</i>

47:36.554 --> 47:39.255
<i> I'm trying to help,</i>
<i> but you refuse!</i>

47:39.257 --> 47:41.190
<i> If you don't</i>
<i> wish to participate</i>

47:41.192 --> 47:43.459
<i> in the architecture</i>
<i> of your wife's legacy,</i>

47:43.461 --> 47:44.527
<i> then so be it.</i>

47:44.529 --> 47:46.028
<i> Just contact me</i>

47:46.030 --> 47:48.197
<i> so I can free you</i>
<i> from this burden.</i>

47:48.199 --> 47:50.900
<i> One more thing.</i>
<i> If you have any respect</i>

47:50.902 --> 47:52.535
<i> for the memory of my daughter,</i>

47:52.537 --> 47:54.470
<i> you'll erase</i>
<i> that fucking message.</i>

47:59.177 --> 48:01.210
<i> This is Karen,</i>
<i> customer service.</i>

48:01.212 --> 48:03.145
<i> Hello, Karen,</i>
<i> customer service.</i>

48:03.147 --> 48:06.148
Hello, mister Mitchell,
what can I do for you today?

48:06.150 --> 48:08.184
<i> This might sound crazy,</i>

48:08.186 --> 48:10.453
but there's a station wagon
that's been stalking me

48:10.455 --> 48:12.154
for the past couple of days,

48:12.156 --> 48:15.057
and this does raise
a number of concerns,

48:15.059 --> 48:18.194
including "a," why would
anyone be following me?

48:18.196 --> 48:21.297
"B," am I possibly in
some kind of danger?

48:21.299 --> 48:24.333
And "c,"

48:24.335 --> 48:26.469
who the fuck still drives
a station wagon?

48:41.618 --> 48:43.619
This is where you get
your prescription filled?

48:43.621 --> 48:46.022
Okay, I lied.
It's not a prescription.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.536
Hey, ray.
This is my friend Davis.

49:01.571 --> 49:02.972
Hello, young man.

49:07.611 --> 49:10.246
Ah, my favorite kind.
Thank you.

49:14.351 --> 49:16.519
And this is for you.

49:18.255 --> 49:21.157
It grows wild in my garden.
Don't ask me how.

49:22.492 --> 49:24.560
I never touch the stuff.
Makes me think too much.

49:25.429 --> 49:26.629
How 'bout you? You need some?

49:26.631 --> 49:27.563
Oh, no.

49:29.399 --> 49:32.301
Oh, that beauty
arrived in 1961.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.004
From Paris.

49:36.273 --> 49:40.042
You should've seen 'er.
A real masterpiece.

49:42.179 --> 49:43.379
Look at that, huh?

49:45.115 --> 49:46.048
Ain't that a beauty?

49:48.285 --> 49:51.287
But nobody wants
carousels anymore.

49:51.289 --> 49:53.022
They want roller coasters

49:53.024 --> 49:55.057
that go upside down
and make you puke.

49:57.394 --> 49:58.561
Would you believe
we've got to tear it down?

49:58.563 --> 50:00.096
Really?

50:00.098 --> 50:02.264
Yeah. Too many repairs.
Too much money.

50:02.266 --> 50:03.599
Can I help you?
I have my own tools.

50:06.370 --> 50:07.436
You're very strange...

50:27.190 --> 50:28.324
Whoo!

50:49.780 --> 50:52.581
You got it! You got it!

50:53.283 --> 50:54.250
Oh!

50:58.722 --> 51:00.790
Karen moreno,
ladies and gentlemen!

51:15.072 --> 51:16.806
Julia loved the ocean.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.309
We used to spend our summers

51:20.311 --> 51:21.710
at her folks' place
in east Hampton.

51:21.712 --> 51:23.679
That's where she wanted to be.

51:27.717 --> 51:28.617
You miss her?

52:34.519 --> 52:38.287
So. Where exactly
are you feeling numb?

52:38.289 --> 52:39.755
Sort of in this whole
area right in here.

52:42.592 --> 52:43.893
And how long have you
been feeling like this?

52:45.562 --> 52:46.929
Can't say...

52:46.931 --> 52:49.832
Ten or twelve years.

53:04.548 --> 53:07.917
Davis... not sure
how to tell you this.

53:09.319 --> 53:11.187
Come on. See for yourself.

53:14.591 --> 53:14.590
Part of your heart is missing.

53:16.493 --> 53:17.660
What?
How did that happen?

53:18.795 --> 53:20.529
Judging by the bite pattern,

53:23.200 --> 53:25.434
I'd say gypsy moths.

53:25.436 --> 53:26.702
Fuck me.

53:26.704 --> 53:27.736
Excuse me?

53:37.948 --> 53:40.683
<i> Dear Karen, I keep</i>
<i> thinking about my childhood.</i>

53:41.985 --> 53:43.552
<i> When I was sick,</i>
<i> and I would lay my head</i>

53:43.554 --> 53:44.553
<i> in my mother's lap,</i>

53:44.555 --> 53:47.489
<i> she'd run her fingers</i>
<i> through my hair.</i>

53:48.792 --> 53:49.825
<i> She'd kiss my eyelids.</i>

53:51.528 --> 53:52.661
<i> And that made</i>
<i> everything better.</i>

53:55.465 --> 53:56.498
<i> Do you think</i>
<i> it's too late for that?</i>

54:55.825 --> 54:56.759
Live here now or something?

54:57.994 --> 54:59.628
No. Shouldn't you
be in school?

55:00.830 --> 55:01.830
I'm suspended.

55:02.966 --> 55:03.999
For what?

55:05.502 --> 55:06.368
Telling the truth.

55:08.071 --> 55:09.838
Had to do this presentation
in world affairs.

55:12.575 --> 55:14.943
About our military presence
in the middle east.

55:14.945 --> 55:16.845
Yeah?
What do you know about it?

55:23.653 --> 55:24.987
June 5th.

55:26.723 --> 55:29.358
During a routine patrol
through the helmand province,

55:33.363 --> 55:34.897
lieutenant Dan doviak's Hummer

55:34.899 --> 55:36.465
pulled over
to the side of the road

55:38.368 --> 55:39.868
to assist a little girl.

55:42.672 --> 55:45.607
To their surprise,
she had 60 pounds

55:45.609 --> 55:46.942
of explosives
strapped to her body.

55:53.683 --> 55:55.484
Oh, shit.

55:55.486 --> 55:56.952
The Hummer was
engulfed in flames.

56:06.563 --> 56:07.963
And the Afghan
citizens chanted,

56:07.965 --> 56:10.666
"death to America."

56:10.668 --> 56:12.401
Doviak and his unit
were burned alive.

56:16.539 --> 56:17.573
They suspend you
for that?

56:29.052 --> 56:30.586
I heard
the dinner bell.

56:39.763 --> 56:40.863
Did you
have a good day?

56:43.733 --> 56:45.467
Enjoy your little vacay?

56:48.037 --> 56:49.905
I'm changing the music, baby.

56:57.547 --> 57:00.616
Come on, lighten up.
Tell me what you did today.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.519
Did you hang out
with that cute girl?

57:03.521 --> 57:06.155
The one with
the high-waisted jeans?

57:06.157 --> 57:07.823
You know, not everyone
can pull that look off.

57:08.057 --> 57:09.124
Right?

57:11.594 --> 57:12.828
Are you for real right now?

57:19.169 --> 57:21.637
I spoke with your principal,
miss... tersian?

57:24.073 --> 57:26.909
I found her to be very
thoughtful and empathetic.

57:28.912 --> 57:30.012
The good news is,
she's letting you

57:30.014 --> 57:32.080
come back starting Monday.

57:32.082 --> 57:33.849
You have to spend a few weeks
with the counselor,

57:33.851 --> 57:35.717
but I think you're
getting off pretty easy.

57:37.120 --> 57:38.587
What's the bad news?

57:38.589 --> 57:39.455
What do you mean?

57:40.857 --> 57:43.492
What the hell
are you talking about?

57:43.494 --> 57:45.194
There's some random guy
eating in our house

57:45.196 --> 57:47.763
while your boyfriend/boss
is out of town,

57:47.765 --> 57:49.231
and you're bragging to me
about a heart-to-heart you had

57:49.233 --> 57:50.799
with my dyke principal?

57:50.801 --> 57:54.503
Would you just...
Okay? Gimme a break!

57:56.639 --> 57:58.707
Davis is a friend of mine.

57:58.709 --> 57:59.842
We've been
spending time together

57:59.844 --> 58:00.809
because that's
what friends do.

58:00.811 --> 58:02.611
You... you spend time.

58:04.681 --> 58:05.547
You're so transparent.

58:06.916 --> 58:08.550
The man's wife just died.

58:08.552 --> 58:10.085
Have some compassion,
you little shit!

58:17.193 --> 58:20.963
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

58:31.808 --> 58:32.708
Your wife just died?

58:34.043 --> 58:34.977
Yeah.

58:38.882 --> 58:38.881
How?

58:42.018 --> 58:45.020
Massive head trauma,
car accident.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.255
Can you pass the salt?

58:57.133 --> 58:59.134
I was thinking about
what you said about

58:59.136 --> 59:00.936
how I'm not using
the f-word properly.

59:02.839 --> 59:05.541
Yeah? What'd you come up with?

59:08.111 --> 59:09.077
Maybe you're right.

59:18.187 --> 59:19.187
<i> Fuck</i>

59:19.189 --> 59:21.123
<i> is a</i>

59:21.891 --> 59:23.859
<i> great word.</i>

59:25.094 --> 59:26.028
<i> Fuck</i>

59:26.963 --> 59:28.330
<i> is a</i>

59:29.132 --> 59:31.133
<i> great word.</i>

59:31.901 --> 59:33.135
<i> Fuck...</i>
Ahh!

59:37.173 --> 59:38.073
Oh, man,
that don't look good at all.

59:38.075 --> 59:39.207
No, it don't.

59:42.211 --> 59:43.879
You dumbass...

59:50.720 --> 59:53.188
Oh, god damn
that fuckin' hurt!

59:53.823 --> 59:55.090
Whoa!

59:55.092 --> 59:56.625
Shit, yeah!

59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.629
Whoo!

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:01.997
Let's go.
Get outta here.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:05.867
<i> Dear Chris...</i>

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.273
<i> I wish I could talk to you.</i>

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.876
<i> I miss how we used to be.</i>

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.815
<i> I miss holding you,</i>
<i> kissing your face...</i>

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.088
<i> I miss my little boy.</i>

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:47.009
Where did
you send this from?

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:48.377
From the mailbox
on the corner.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.713
I thought the last one
was the last one.

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.985
What do we do
with a couch like this?

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:03.825
Mmm, kiss me!

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.160
Ooh, that feels good!

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.302
Okay, listen to me.

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:16.238
When was the last time

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.674
you really, really
cared about something?

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:23.111
Like, when you were a kid.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:25.213
What was the most
important thing to you?

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.754
Running fast. Yup.

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:34.823
We used to race on blacktop
at recess,

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:38.126
and then I was always so slow.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:45.167
Just once,
i wanted to beat 'em all,

01:01:45.169 --> 01:01:46.468
and blow 'em all away.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.136
Have 'em cheer for me,

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.438
and not Rick russoman
or Mike barone,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.907
and those speedy
motherfuckers.

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:58.246
Yep.
I just wanted to run fast,

01:01:58.248 --> 01:01:59.748
more than anything.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.417
I mean,
more than break dancing.

01:02:06.823 --> 01:02:07.789
Yeah...

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:14.950
Jesus! Can't I get
a little privacy?
Whoa! Sorry, man! I thought...

01:04:14.952 --> 01:04:16.184
I thought you were
back in school!

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.185
I'm taking a personal day.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:20.555
What is that?

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.625
Nothing.

01:04:23.627 --> 01:04:24.526
Let's see.

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.333
It's Carl's.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.339
Ever shot a gun before?

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.922
Your turn.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.309
Let's shoot something.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:16.344
Like what?

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:19.414
I dunno.
A deer or something.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:20.682
I don't think
there are any out here.

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:23.618
What about a squirrel?

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:27.555
Hold on a second.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:45.707
You sure that thing's legit?

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:49.010
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

01:05:51.414 --> 01:05:53.381
Ready?
Yeah.

01:05:53.383 --> 01:05:55.317
Want me to count down,
or like...

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:56.484
I dunno, do
whatever you want.

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:57.285
Okay, I'll surprise you.

01:05:58.054 --> 01:05:58.954
Surprise me.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.426
Safety's on.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.629
Yup, it's on the left side.

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:09.965
Yeah, you gotta switch...
Turn...

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.132
Ahh!
Shit.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:21.276
What'd it feel like?

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.178
Shit-yeah!

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:25.513
Whoo!

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:28.049
It hurt, but in like a...

01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:31.553
It's like a good kinda hurt.

01:06:31.555 --> 01:06:33.221
It felt like someone
was kinda, um...

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:35.724
Whoa.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.093
Surprise!

01:06:42.198 --> 01:06:45.066
You are...
You are one fucked-up kid.

01:06:45.068 --> 01:06:46.401
You're one fucked-up adult.

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.472
Don't ever do this again.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:53.575
Fuck!

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:55.510
You're trying too hard.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.367
And set to go.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.370
Thank you, dude.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.567
Ah!

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.337
Excuse me! Sir?

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:04.171
Excuse me! Sir!
Do you have an appointment?

01:09:04.174 --> 01:09:06.608
No, Marty,
I'm just swingin' through!

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.542
Oh, Mr. Mitchell. Sorry.

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:10.345
Hey, buddy.

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.180
Davis!
Phil here?

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:13.314
Yeah, they're doing
the interviews

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:15.383
for the scholarship
candidates!

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:19.220
Mister big!
You better watch out!

01:09:19.221 --> 01:09:21.221
...breathing. It's just
me and the water, and...

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:26.560
Sorry.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:29.564
- Hey, guys.
- Excuse us.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.832
Hey, Davis.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.167
We're in the middle
of something.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.801
Mind if I sit?

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:35.737
Hi, margot.

01:09:37.872 --> 01:09:39.607
You okay, pal?

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:40.841
You look like you've been

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:40.841
doing construction
or something.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:43.778
Steve. I got a fucking nail
in my foot.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:44.946
It hurt like hell,
but I'm okay now.

01:09:46.381 --> 01:09:47.649
So, Todd,
you were saying?

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:50.551
Right. Um...

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.556
Lost my train of thought.

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:55.857
We won.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.458
Oh.
What'd you win?

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.794
Swimming. I'm a swimmer.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.864
Ah.
Do you swim?

01:10:02.866 --> 01:10:04.866
You know,
i used to do laps at the y

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.601
and then I realized
how many people

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:08.403
must urinate in that pool
on a daily basis,

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:10.471
and that kinda
ruined it for me.

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:11.573
Yeah.

01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:14.642
I don't understand
where this is coming from.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:19.247
This contempt,
this blatant disrespect!

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:20.782
Well, something
doesn't feel right, Phil.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:23.484
This whole thing, you know?

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:25.220
I wanna do something for her,
but this just doesn't...

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:26.554
You are not feeling right!

01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:33.695
We're picking
the finalists today.

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.565
I want it signed
on my desk by tomorrow,

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:39.701
or you're done here.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:43.438
I mean, we're done.

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.444
Why you buying all this shit?

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:28.016
Uh, the tools of the trade,
my young friend.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:29.951
What trade would that be?

01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:36.891
Destruction, devastation.

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.695
I mean, haven't you
ever wanted to just

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:42.330
smash the shit
out of something?

01:11:47.503 --> 01:11:50.571
Davis, if I were to
ask you a question,

01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:52.440
you'd give me
a straight answer, right?

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:54.642
I mean, that's your thing,
being honest about everything.

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:57.545
Yeah, that's my thing.

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:03.418
Do you think I'm gay?

01:12:10.826 --> 01:12:12.460
I dunno, Chris.

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:17.332
Do you think you're gay?

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:20.802
I dunno. I think maybe.
I figured you would tell me.

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:23.705
Okay. Let's figure it
out together.

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:26.074
Do you like girls?

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:28.943
I dunno.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:31.779
I think Jennifer hymen's
pretty. She flirts with me.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.381
And sometimes,
i can see the outline

01:12:33.383 --> 01:12:36.017
of her bra through
her shirt, but...

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.853
I dunno if I like her,
or if I'm just fixating.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.054
Jennifer hymen.
That's really her name?

01:12:41.056 --> 01:12:42.757
Yeah.
That fuckin' blows.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:46.494
What about the boys at school?

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:47.862
Is there anybody
that you like,

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:48.763
that you find attractive?

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.100
Maybe Andrew white.

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:53.735
He's a junior,

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:55.436
and we have
the same gym class too.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:56.904
We have to get
changed together.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:57.705
Do you watch him
when you get changed?

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.374
No.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:12:59.374
Well, then I don't think
you're gay, Chris.

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:03.411
I have to try not to look.
I have to tell myself not to.

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:06.748
Yeah, no, that's normal,
you know.

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.650
I mean you're young,
and you're curious, it's...

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:10.985
Sometimes, I imagine
his dick in my mouth.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.389
Oh.

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:18.993
That's different.

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:25.666
Uh, I would say that
you're probably gay.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:27.869
I mean, you know,
or you're bisexual.

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:31.072
But I mean, either way, you're
gonna get tortured. Um...

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:37.111
I mean, my advice
to you, would be

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.814
to pretend that you like girls
for the next few years,

01:13:39.816 --> 01:13:42.517
and then move into
the city, you know?

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.619
Or San Francisco?

01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:46.754
Or even Los Angeles,
if you like warm weather.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:51.893
Anything else?

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:52.894
No.

01:13:58.834 --> 01:13:59.834
Get in.

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:03.905
Ah!

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:06.207
Whoa!

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:10.178
What are we doing again?

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.548
We're taking apart
my marriage.

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.663
Yeah.

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:53.147
Fuckin' a.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.185
Not bad. Keep at it.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:36.123
Now hold it.
Just like that.

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.030
Who's that?

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.911
Who the fuck still drives
a station wagon?

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:03.217
No, I just wanna have it...
I wanna take it back home,

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:06.220
see what it looks like in the
library or, uh, in the study.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.157
Nope, not a peep out of him.

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:11.959
Lawyers are exploring
other options.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.060
We'll get him to sign.

01:17:14.296 --> 01:17:15.997
Did you send him
an invitation?

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:18.199
Oh, come on, honey.

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.308
Davis picked me up
after school.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:31.145
Hey. Uh, he was helping me
around my house. Housework...

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:33.280
Hey.

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:43.190
Thank you.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:18.059
A bulldozer.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:21.395
You know, you can buy
almost anything on ebay.

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.131
I just hope it comes
with a manual.

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.379
Hey... shit.

01:18:40.116 --> 01:18:41.916
A manual and a warranty.

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:50.337
She was so young.

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:54.008
Hey, uh...

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.209
Phil would like to
talk to you immediately.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:00.681
I'll be right back, okay?

01:22:00.683 --> 01:22:01.615
Okay.

01:22:23.538 --> 01:22:24.705
Hey there.

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.310
Oof!

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:32.513
Why you smoking that garbage?
I got something nice.

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.284
I'm Todd. Do you swim?

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:42.589
You dare...

01:22:42.591 --> 01:22:44.658
Bringing another
woman here? Tonight?

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:45.693
Phil, it's not
what you think...

01:22:45.695 --> 01:22:47.428
How fuckin' dare you?

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.130
Every day!
I wake up thinking, why her?

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.668
It should've been you!

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.289
Signed.

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:23.697
So, Karen.

01:23:27.135 --> 01:23:28.469
Can I feel your tits?

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:42.316
Julia's mother and I,
and her husband,

01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:44.051
would like to thank you all

01:23:44.053 --> 01:23:46.320
for sharing
this special evening.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.723
For those of you who were
fortunate enough

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:52.226
to be a part of Julia's life,

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:56.263
you know what a wonderful
person she was.

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:57.231
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:23:57.233 --> 01:23:58.332
A beautiful soul.

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.507
So many memories.

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.513
Wouldn't even know
where to begin.

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:17.117
But I do know this.

01:24:17.119 --> 01:24:18.819
I would trade
every one of them

01:24:18.821 --> 01:24:21.055
for one more minute
with our daughter.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.526
Julia brought out
the best in people.

01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:27.227
That was her gift.

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:28.662
Now, through

01:24:28.664 --> 01:24:32.099
the Julia Eastwood-Mitchell
scholarship fund,

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.736
that gift will be her legacy.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:46.180
I'd like to introduce
three young adults

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:48.449
so outstanding
in their character

01:24:48.451 --> 01:24:50.217
and academic achievements

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:54.354
that we couldn't choose
just one recipient.

01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:56.824
So please welcome
our first-year scholars:

01:24:56.826 --> 01:24:58.358
Jennifer Williams.

01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:03.697
Benjamin Howard!

01:25:05.133 --> 01:25:07.334
And the backstroke
record-holder himself,

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:08.435
Todd koehler!

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:11.405
Thank you.

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:19.847
Sorry.

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:27.788
Did she tell you
she was pregnant?

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:31.158
Last year.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.460
Did you know?

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:40.601
Why didn't she tell me?

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:50.744
You wanna know why?

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.415
It wasn't yours.

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.356
She was seeing someone.

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.492
And I took her
for the procedure.

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.696
I wish she'd kept it.

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.584
Here's your refund.

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:39.319
Keep the change.

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:47.794
<i> Davis.</i>

01:27:49.897 --> 01:27:50.964
Davis.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.836
Hey. I'm sorry.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.272
How is he?

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:02.309
They're not saying much.
He's, uh, still in surgery.

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:07.447
It was six of them
beating the shit out of him.

01:28:11.453 --> 01:28:12.853
I feel like it's all my fault.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:16.356
I had one fuckin' job.

01:28:16.358 --> 01:28:17.357
Miss moreno!

01:28:27.835 --> 01:28:30.037
Baby? Hey.

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:32.572
Honey?

01:28:34.877 --> 01:28:36.610
Listen to me.

01:28:36.612 --> 01:28:37.878
I won't let anyone
hurt you ever again.

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.447
And I won't hurt you either.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:45.352
I just want you to be
who you are.

01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:46.520
You hear me?

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:50.524
I'll do better, I promise.

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:57.064
And when you wake up,
you are in so much trouble.

01:29:03.871 --> 01:29:05.072
Thank you.

01:29:38.106 --> 01:29:39.106
What's your name?

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:41.842
Michael.

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.445
I know about
everything, Michael.

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:48.849
And it's okay.

01:29:52.153 --> 01:29:54.621
I just hope that
you cared for her

01:29:54.623 --> 01:29:56.423
because she deserved that.

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:01.461
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.098
I was in the other car.

01:30:08.803 --> 01:30:10.137
I was, uh...

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:13.473
Driving the car
that hit you.

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:20.080
And I've been
trying to, um...

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:23.617
I've been trying...

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:28.588
I'm sorry.
It's okay, man.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:29.723
I'm so sorry.
It's okay, man.

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.162
"Not my chair,
not my problem."

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:10.063
Is that what you say?

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:05.118
You got two minutes.

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:09.256
Thank you for
meeting me, Phil.

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.792
I'm sorry.

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:16.196
Um...

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.867
There was love
between me and Julia.

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.605
I just didn't
take care of it.

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:31.745
I think the
scholarship is...

01:32:31.747 --> 01:32:33.647
It's good.
I think that it's good.

01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:35.081
I understand it. Um...

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:37.951
But I wanna do
something else for her.

01:32:40.154 --> 01:32:43.256
And, uh, I was
wondering if, um...

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.728
You'd wanna be
a part of it.

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.212
Could I...

01:33:06.214 --> 01:33:07.047
Go ahead, have a seat.

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:22.115
<i> Dear Davis,</i>
<i> thanks for your letter.</i>

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:24.984
<i> I'm recovering slowly</i>
<i> but surely.</i>

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.788
<i> Despite the ass-kicking,</i>
<i> I must say,</i>

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:30.023

01:35:31.258 --> 01:35:34.094
<i> By the way,</i>
<i> mom left Carl, fyi.</i>

01:35:34.096 --> 01:35:36.329
Ten! Nine! Eight!

<i> I have a little gift for you.</i>

01:35:37.466 --> 01:35:39.432
Seven! Six! Five! Four!

01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:42.168
<i> Be at pier 64 this Saturday</i>
<i> at 11:00 A.M. sharp.</i>

01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:44.137

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.179
Yeah!

01:36:04.024 --> 01:36:06.359
<i> P.S. Go fuck yourself.</i>

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:34.093
<i> Warmest regards,</i>
<i> Davis c. Mitchell.</i>
