WEBVTT

01:28.634 --> 01:30.499
Griet.

01:35.341 --> 01:36.968
Leave that.

01:49.922 --> 01:52.413
- Griet?
- Father.

02:11.377 --> 02:13.140
Do you remember?

02:13.179 --> 02:14.976
You watched me paint it.

02:33.666 --> 02:36.260
I never thought our family
would come to this.

02:39.872 --> 02:42.102
Food may be strange
to your stomach.

02:46.646 --> 02:49.012
Keep clear of their Catholic prayers.

02:49.048 --> 02:52.506
Or if you must be with them
when they pray...

02:52.552 --> 02:54.042
stop your ears.

04:08.294 --> 04:10.762
Give it.
I got Cornelia's too.

04:10.796 --> 04:12.991
- Give it back.
- Stop it!

04:15.234 --> 04:17.566
You did not get it.
I did.

04:17.637 --> 04:20.037
Do you know the house
of Master Vermeer?

04:20.072 --> 04:23.200
Tell Tanneke
the new maid is here.

04:45.197 --> 04:48.132
You took your time.
Lose your way, did you?

04:50.369 --> 04:52.667
Young mistress is out
this morning.

04:52.738 --> 04:55.172
I'm to show you round.

04:55.207 --> 04:58.074
Water for the table.

04:59.412 --> 05:02.176
Take water from the canal
for laundry.

05:02.214 --> 05:04.079
It's clean enough
this side of town.

05:05.785 --> 05:08.583
Soda...
coppers, boiler...

05:08.621 --> 05:10.452
sand and soap.

05:10.489 --> 05:12.980
In cooking kitchen you're to help
serve and clear,

05:13.025 --> 05:14.822
buy fish and meat...

05:14.860 --> 05:17.454
when young mistress
don't want to.

05:17.496 --> 05:19.930
You'll take your meals
with me and the children.

05:22.601 --> 05:24.091
That's your sleeping place.

05:26.539 --> 05:28.166
Scour the pots and pans.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.732
Young mistress and master sleep
and have company here.

05:31.811 --> 05:33.779
You'll get used to it.

05:40.886 --> 05:42.444
You're to clean in there.

05:44.924 --> 05:46.915
Not now!

05:46.959 --> 05:49.291
He's painting.

07:59.492 --> 08:01.187
Good morning, madam.

08:02.595 --> 08:04.620
Don't speak till
you're spoken to.

08:06.031 --> 08:09.194
Tanneke showed you what needs
to be done? The laundry and so on?

08:09.235 --> 08:10.532
Yes, madam.

08:10.569 --> 08:14.938
This is only a trial.
Nothing is settled yet.

08:39.698 --> 08:41.029
I...

08:44.169 --> 08:46.034
my husband does...

08:48.240 --> 08:49.332
Go in.

08:51.911 --> 08:53.378
Go in.

09:31.884 --> 09:33.852
Disturb nothing.

09:33.886 --> 09:36.047
Leave all just as it is.

09:39.692 --> 09:42.320
Open the shutters,
you can't work in the dark.

11:40.913 --> 11:44.246
You're not the first to forget
your manners in front of his paintings.

11:46.518 --> 11:47.917
<i>Tell me, girl...</i>

11:47.953 --> 11:50.717
do you think it finished?

11:53.258 --> 11:54.657
Three months.

11:54.693 --> 11:57.958
Another three before he's satisfied,
no doubt.

12:00.199 --> 12:01.461
Well get along, girl.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.730
You're not paid
to stand gawping all day.

12:11.076 --> 12:12.236
Good to see you.

12:12.277 --> 12:14.245
Are you well?
Yeah.

12:18.817 --> 12:20.910
- Can we go?
- Here's my man.

12:20.953 --> 12:22.443
Paul.

12:22.488 --> 12:24.649
This is Griet,
the new maid.

12:24.690 --> 12:25.850
She'll fetch the meat now.

12:25.891 --> 12:26.983
So, Griet...

12:27.025 --> 12:28.822
what takes your fancy?

12:28.861 --> 12:30.795
Nothing is too good
for this family?

12:30.829 --> 12:33.297
An ox tongue
and a dozen chops.

12:33.332 --> 12:34.959
Pieter...

12:35.000 --> 12:36.900
chops...

12:36.935 --> 12:38.926
In the book again?

12:44.143 --> 12:45.110
There you are.

12:52.751 --> 12:54.309
This meat's not fresh.

12:58.724 --> 13:00.453
The mistress won't like it.

13:02.461 --> 13:03.485
Pieter.

13:07.132 --> 13:09.123
Get the parcel
on the cart.

13:26.618 --> 13:27.846
That's better.

13:29.454 --> 13:31.319
We'll see you again, Griet.

13:31.356 --> 13:32.584
Yes.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.024
No!

13:43.068 --> 13:44.695
I'll take that.

13:47.573 --> 13:48.540
Make way now.

13:51.210 --> 13:54.077
- What is it?
- Bankrupt.

13:54.112 --> 13:58.048
They've lived next door
for as long as I can remember.

13:59.818 --> 14:01.581
The shame.

14:02.855 --> 14:04.413
Lost everything.

14:06.358 --> 14:08.986
Watch out for young mistress.

14:09.027 --> 14:10.619
She hates money troubles.

14:12.464 --> 14:15.228
She'll turn spiteful at this,
you mark my words.

14:20.305 --> 14:24.241
The last time you said it was
done you kept it another six months!

14:24.276 --> 14:25.641
It will be done soon.

14:25.677 --> 14:28.544
Oh yes, soon.
But when is soon?

14:28.580 --> 14:30.639
Next month, next year?

14:30.682 --> 14:32.013
It's all the same to you,

14:32.050 --> 14:34.985
if your children starve
and your wife is dressed in rags.

14:35.020 --> 14:37.682
When you sit up there
and suck at your paintbrush...

14:37.723 --> 14:39.384
You're being ridiculous.
I'm going out.

14:39.424 --> 14:41.585
No, Jan,
don't you dare leave.

14:45.597 --> 14:49.260
One year it got so bad,
they had to sell some of their jewels.

14:49.301 --> 14:53.897
You could imagine
how that pleased her.

14:53.972 --> 14:55.997
She smashed half the china...

14:56.074 --> 14:58.770
went to spoil
one of his precious paintings.

15:00.879 --> 15:04.144
Well, he's a temper on him too
for all he's so quiet.

15:07.819 --> 15:11.550
She's not set so much as a foot
in his studio from that day to this.

16:00.505 --> 16:02.973
There you are.
Fetch some water.

16:03.008 --> 16:04.373
Hail Mary, Mother of God,

16:04.409 --> 16:06.809
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

16:06.845 --> 16:09.973
Six babies. Why does
she have to make such a racket?

16:10.015 --> 16:11.448
Just get on with the work.

16:11.483 --> 16:12.711
Push!

16:16.355 --> 16:18.414
I need more rags, girl.

16:18.457 --> 16:19.981
More rags.

16:26.465 --> 16:27.989
Push, push!

16:28.033 --> 16:30.228
Good, that's good!

16:31.436 --> 16:34.030
Oh, Jan,
isn't he just like you?

16:35.207 --> 16:37.334
Johannes, that's it.

16:37.409 --> 16:39.877
Look at him,
he's your little brother.

16:52.391 --> 16:56.020
Take this to the house of your master's
patron, Pieter van Ruijven.

17:15.781 --> 17:18.272
To the left.

17:18.316 --> 17:20.944
Open up,
there's a lady coming in.

17:22.421 --> 17:23.820
That's it.

17:29.995 --> 17:31.587
So, finished at last.

17:34.066 --> 17:36.296
Honored guest.

17:36.334 --> 17:40.498
It's the old woman's idea to combine
the birth feast and the viewing.

17:40.572 --> 17:42.267
She is a tight fist.

17:44.342 --> 17:47.470
I won't turn out
for small beer and biscuits, tell her.

17:47.512 --> 17:49.571
Me and the brat
deserve a proper feast.

17:54.453 --> 17:57.115
You have a very wide eyes.

17:57.155 --> 17:59.589
What do they call you?

18:01.593 --> 18:03.458
- Griet.
- Griet?

18:04.496 --> 18:05.895
Griet.

18:09.668 --> 18:13.069
Your master is a fine painter,
Griet.

18:13.138 --> 18:15.834
The finest in Delft.

18:15.907 --> 18:16.874
He's painted me.

18:17.976 --> 18:20.809
Perhaps that will be
my epitaph.

18:28.253 --> 18:30.346
Look at that dress.

18:30.388 --> 18:32.720
You can almost stroke
the satin.

18:32.757 --> 18:35.851
And the wine winkling
through the glass.

18:38.530 --> 18:41.294
Can you imagine yourself
in such finery, Griet?

18:44.503 --> 18:46.562
She loved it, you know.

18:46.638 --> 18:50.404
Lace and satin pressed tight
against the plump little bubbies.

18:51.443 --> 18:55.379
The silk, heavy on her thighs.

18:55.447 --> 18:57.108
The gentlemen watching.

18:58.783 --> 19:01.343
My God, she was happy.

19:01.386 --> 19:03.581
She thought she was somebody.

19:03.622 --> 19:05.647
All dressed up like a lady.

19:07.592 --> 19:09.423
Green as grass,
mind you.

19:11.663 --> 19:13.290
She had only worked there
a few months

19:13.331 --> 19:16.823
before Master Van Ruijven
brought her over to be painted.

19:16.868 --> 19:20.531
Got her into that fine red dress.

19:22.174 --> 19:25.075
Poured wine down her
like he was forcing a goose.

19:25.110 --> 19:26.543
That dress
can't have stayed on long.

19:26.578 --> 19:30.878
She was carrying his by-blow
before the painting was dry.

19:35.654 --> 19:39.522
He thinks we don't know
how to celebrate a birth, does he?

20:01.746 --> 20:02.940
Come on, keep up.

20:11.122 --> 20:14.580
Come on now, my little one.
I've got a lovely apple for you.

20:14.626 --> 20:16.787
The price was three guilders,
I'm sure of that.

20:16.828 --> 20:20.264
Three guilders...
thank you.

20:53.331 --> 20:54.821
Why are you here?

20:56.501 --> 21:00.460
A nice greeting, when I brought
the meat order just for you.

21:00.505 --> 21:02.370
Better carry it through.

21:06.778 --> 21:08.268
Not even a smile
for my pains?

21:08.346 --> 21:10.371
Not today.

21:11.383 --> 21:13.010
Come on.

21:16.521 --> 21:19.115
I'll put it in the book, then.
Owed by Griet...

21:19.157 --> 21:21.352
one smile.

21:40.845 --> 21:42.312
And don't they look marvelous?

21:49.721 --> 21:51.712
Welcome,
Master Van Ruijven.

21:51.756 --> 21:53.053
Mistress Thins.

22:16.348 --> 22:18.680
Friends and neighbors,

22:18.717 --> 22:21.686
our honored guest,
Master Van Ruijven...

22:21.720 --> 22:23.483
not only
are we gathered tonight

22:23.521 --> 22:26.115
to celebrate the safe delivery
into this world,

22:26.157 --> 22:29.354
praise be to God,
of little Franciscus,

22:30.795 --> 22:34.424
but also to rejoice
at another birth,

22:34.466 --> 22:39.267
a new masterpiece
from the hand of my son-in-law

22:39.337 --> 22:41.168
Johannes Vermeer.

23:08.833 --> 23:10.425
Is this Indian yellow?

23:13.304 --> 23:16.296
Distilled from the urine
of sacred cows

23:16.374 --> 23:18.865
fed only on mango leaves.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.313
You've glazed my wife
in dried piss.

23:30.121 --> 23:31.383
It was the right color.

23:31.423 --> 23:33.414
No stinting, eh?

23:37.929 --> 23:41.194
I cannot bear the suspense
a moment longer, Master Van Ruijven.

23:41.232 --> 23:43.291
Pray tell us
what you think.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.802
This is good.

23:47.372 --> 23:51.672
Color and perspective is true,
the illusion... is perfect.

23:55.380 --> 23:58.406
All this skill lavished
on my dear Emilie.

23:59.451 --> 24:00.475
Why...

24:01.486 --> 24:05.115
it's almost as if...
she were thinking.

24:05.156 --> 24:08.648
And have you considered
the subject for your next commission?

24:08.693 --> 24:11.890
We cannot expect you to give up Emilie
for so long again.

24:11.930 --> 24:14.421
Considered? It's already in hand.
Didn't I tell you?

24:14.466 --> 24:16.627
A coming fellow
from Amsterdam.

24:16.668 --> 24:19.228
Studied under
Rembrandt van Rijn,

24:19.304 --> 24:20.828
though, who hasn't
these days?

24:23.575 --> 24:28.410
"A Merry Company by Candlelight,"
candlelight being his forte.

24:31.716 --> 24:34.116
So, have you decided
what to daub next, Jan?

24:34.152 --> 24:37.246
Have you found inspiration up
in that room of yours?

24:38.256 --> 24:42.659
Is there another patron in Delft
with pockets as deep as mine?

24:42.694 --> 24:45.060
I've not yet found a subject.

25:41.920 --> 25:42.909
Yes?

25:42.954 --> 25:44.888
About the studio, mistress.

25:46.524 --> 25:48.253
Should I clean the windows?

25:48.293 --> 25:50.853
You don't need to ask me
about such matters.

25:50.895 --> 25:51.884
It's just...

25:54.365 --> 25:56.492
it may change the light.

26:04.842 --> 26:06.207
Of course.

26:07.845 --> 26:08.812
Wash them.

26:57.362 --> 26:59.455
Stay as you were.

27:06.037 --> 27:07.265
By the window.

27:18.049 --> 27:19.573
Drop it.

27:28.726 --> 27:29.715
Just...

27:42.240 --> 27:43.730
You can go.

28:30.888 --> 28:32.583
Brothers and sisters...

28:32.623 --> 28:35.285
welcome to the house
of the Lord God.

28:35.326 --> 28:38.853
Let us lift up our hearts
and voices together

28:38.896 --> 28:42.388
to give Him thanks and praise
for our safe passage...

28:57.482 --> 29:00.883
Father, mother,
this is Pieter,

29:00.918 --> 29:04.217
our butcher's son...
the family's butcher.

29:04.255 --> 29:06.689
Sir, mistress,
I'm glad to meet you.

29:06.724 --> 29:11.252
So, the butcher...
that's a good trade.

29:11.295 --> 29:14.696
Griet is the hardest to please
of all our customers.

29:14.732 --> 29:18.498
Aye, she gets that from me.

29:20.371 --> 29:22.430
There now, I forgot.

29:22.507 --> 29:24.498
We must speak with
Willem Jansson.

29:24.575 --> 29:27.373
Griet, you go on
with Pieter there.

29:34.585 --> 29:36.314
Good morning.
- So Griet...

29:36.354 --> 29:38.788
where is that smile
you owe me,

29:38.823 --> 29:41.485
when I have been so clever
as to track you down?

29:45.229 --> 29:47.129
You had nothing better
to do.

29:58.109 --> 30:00.304
Shocking.
She should know better.

30:00.344 --> 30:01.811
She should at her age.

30:05.149 --> 30:08.710
When I saw you with Tanneke I thought
you were a little Catholic girl.

30:16.427 --> 30:18.452
He started a new painting.

30:21.199 --> 30:22.598
There's no buyer.

30:22.633 --> 30:25.124
He won't even let me see it.

30:25.203 --> 30:27.034
But he's working again.

30:27.104 --> 30:29.402
It usually takes him longer.

31:14.619 --> 31:16.018
Good.

31:20.024 --> 31:23.152
Very good.
Keep it level all the time.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.039
Do you know what it is?

32:19.116 --> 32:20.947
A camera obscura.

32:35.466 --> 32:36.763
Look into the glass.

32:50.414 --> 32:52.382
Here. Put this on.

33:04.628 --> 33:05.959
You can see?

33:11.702 --> 33:14.466
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- No, don't worry about the robe.

33:14.538 --> 33:15.869
What did you see?

33:19.810 --> 33:21.072
I saw the painting.

33:24.115 --> 33:25.139
But...

33:30.221 --> 33:31.950
how did it get in there?

33:36.127 --> 33:37.617
See this?

33:39.764 --> 33:40.890
This is called "a lens."

33:40.931 --> 33:44.458
Beams of reflected light
from that corner pass through it...

33:45.703 --> 33:48.228
into the box...
so that we can see it here.

33:48.305 --> 33:50.136
Is it real?

33:50.174 --> 33:52.404
It's an image.

33:52.443 --> 33:56.072
A picture made of light.

33:58.149 --> 34:00.743
Does the box show you
what to paint?

34:08.759 --> 34:09.851
It helps.

34:17.134 --> 34:20.228
You didn't get me.
I got you.

34:20.304 --> 34:21.669
No, you're cheating.

34:21.739 --> 34:23.707
Oh, do we have to play this?

34:25.076 --> 34:26.100
So...

34:27.645 --> 34:30.011
Stop it.
Oh, look Cornelia.

34:30.047 --> 34:31.275
There.

34:32.283 --> 34:33.477
Now you're it.

34:34.518 --> 34:36.679
- I've got it.
- I've got it.

34:36.720 --> 34:37.709
Yes I can.

34:37.755 --> 34:39.154
- No way.
- It's mine.

34:39.190 --> 34:41.715
- No.
- I'll catch it.

34:41.759 --> 34:43.283
Cornelia!

34:47.665 --> 34:49.132
I won't tell you again.

34:50.367 --> 34:51.493
Girls, come inside.

34:51.535 --> 34:54.561
- Why?
- Come on. Don't make a fuss.

35:26.770 --> 35:28.203
It's dirty now.

36:43.747 --> 36:45.908
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Shh...

36:53.023 --> 36:54.513
Stay.

37:19.516 --> 37:21.279
Lead white.

37:26.423 --> 37:29.221
From the cupboard.

38:06.297 --> 38:08.288
Please let me see your hair.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.668
What color is it?

38:14.305 --> 38:15.363
Brown.

38:17.775 --> 38:18.764
Straight or curly?

38:20.878 --> 38:22.106
Neither.

38:22.146 --> 38:23.875
Long?

38:23.914 --> 38:27.372
- Very long?
- No.

38:31.622 --> 38:33.886
My mother will expect me home.

38:33.924 --> 38:36.415
She knows where you are, Griet.

38:51.475 --> 38:54.171
You're looking at it?

38:57.181 --> 38:58.580
Well...

38:58.615 --> 39:01.846
Nothing is the right color.

39:03.821 --> 39:05.220
This is the base color.

39:05.255 --> 39:07.883
It gives the tone...

39:07.925 --> 39:10.553
shadow in the light.

39:10.594 --> 39:12.619
And when it's dry...

39:12.663 --> 39:14.858
I glaze over it with blue, but...

39:14.898 --> 39:17.662
thinly, so that
the black shows through.

39:27.444 --> 39:28.604
Look, Griet.

39:30.814 --> 39:31.974
Look at the clouds.

39:35.719 --> 39:37.084
What color are they?

39:43.394 --> 39:44.759
White?

39:46.296 --> 39:48.890
No...
not white.

39:57.374 --> 39:58.739
Yellow.

40:02.346 --> 40:05.213
Blue...
and grey.

40:07.317 --> 40:09.285
There are colors
in the clouds.

40:16.827 --> 40:18.795
Now you understand.

40:41.084 --> 40:43.518
Thinking about
your butcher boy?

41:12.549 --> 41:14.039
Come.

41:16.086 --> 41:19.419
This... is ruby shellac.

41:28.499 --> 41:29.864
Gum arabic.

41:34.505 --> 41:35.802
Wine skin.

41:40.744 --> 41:42.905
This will make verdigris.

41:44.748 --> 41:46.272
Malachite.

41:50.020 --> 41:51.749
Vermilion.

41:57.928 --> 41:59.691
That...

42:01.398 --> 42:02.660
linseed oil.

42:04.801 --> 42:06.029
Bone black.

42:06.069 --> 42:08.970
An you grind it with a muller,
like this.

42:18.515 --> 42:19.743
You try.

42:34.498 --> 42:36.193
Twist from the shoulder.

42:38.569 --> 42:40.127
It's like this.

43:24.948 --> 43:27.508
Griet!

43:28.385 --> 43:29.374
The child needs a draught.

43:32.489 --> 43:35.822
My mother will not be content
till one of them dies from her meanness.

43:35.859 --> 43:36.848
Come on.

43:36.893 --> 43:39.487
You will need...

43:48.739 --> 43:50.434
On the master's account.

44:04.054 --> 44:06.022
- Griet.
- Sir?

44:07.891 --> 44:10.018
I want you to get something
for me, too.

44:11.294 --> 44:12.784
I want some colors.

44:16.533 --> 44:17.898
My wife need not know.

44:24.041 --> 44:26.032
This is too thin.

45:47.924 --> 45:49.391
Did you get the lapis?

45:53.630 --> 45:55.359
You can mix the colors.

45:57.534 --> 45:58.660
Mix the colors?

46:00.103 --> 46:01.764
Sir, I haven't time.

46:03.306 --> 46:05.274
Make time.

46:36.373 --> 46:37.533
Nurse!

46:37.607 --> 46:41.008
- Nurse.
I'm coming.

46:44.881 --> 46:47.816
Nurse! Come on!
Quickly.

47:19.382 --> 47:22.078
How much longer is the wet nurse
to be with us, mistress?

47:23.220 --> 47:24.710
I don't know.

47:24.754 --> 47:26.984
A month or so.

47:27.023 --> 47:29.184
No, Cornelia,
not my pearls.

47:29.226 --> 47:30.818
A month or more.

47:33.864 --> 47:34.853
Why?

47:34.898 --> 47:36.923
What's it to you?

47:36.967 --> 47:39.765
Well, she's eating us out of house
and home for a start.

47:39.803 --> 47:42.294
She must eat for the baby.

47:42.372 --> 47:46.604
All I'm saying is, I can't cook
twice as much and have no sleep at all.

47:46.643 --> 47:48.873
Tell her to be quiet, then.

47:48.912 --> 47:51.278
If I could just go back to the cellar...

47:51.314 --> 47:52.679
Well, you can't.

47:55.452 --> 47:57.181
Griet has your place.

48:03.793 --> 48:05.351
Why not move Tanneke back?

48:11.101 --> 48:13.160
Put a mattress in the attic
for Griet.

48:13.236 --> 48:15.568
Tanneke can sleep soundly...

48:16.773 --> 48:20.004
and Griet can clean the studio
before she comes down in the morning.

48:24.614 --> 48:25.945
My jewels.

48:28.418 --> 48:30.443
You always have my jewels
up there to paint.

48:31.488 --> 48:32.716
She...

48:34.057 --> 48:35.422
You lock up at night,

48:35.458 --> 48:37.323
open it in the morning.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.674
There.
Are you satisfied, Tanneke?

48:52.709 --> 48:54.176
Yes, mistress.

50:21.464 --> 50:22.931
Got it.
I win again.

50:22.966 --> 50:24.558
No, we are drawing.

50:24.601 --> 50:26.694
- Well, I do.
- No you don't.

50:31.274 --> 50:33.799
No need to go
to the fish market tomorrow.

50:33.877 --> 50:36.311
Mistress wants eggs.

50:40.483 --> 50:42.110
No...

50:42.152 --> 50:46.054
she cannot abide the smell
when she's with child.

50:51.127 --> 50:52.788
So soon?

50:52.829 --> 50:55.195
As if there weren't enough mouths
to feed already.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.189
Still...

50:59.502 --> 51:00.935
what can you do, eh?

51:02.572 --> 51:03.561
Men.

51:43.613 --> 51:45.410
Marvelous.

51:47.517 --> 51:49.781
No, Jan.

55:56.032 --> 55:57.897
Why did you move the chair?

56:03.940 --> 56:05.498
She looked trapped.

56:26.829 --> 56:27.853
Griet!

56:29.365 --> 56:30.923
Are you up there?

56:48.751 --> 56:50.946
One of my tortoiseshell combs
is gone.

57:04.834 --> 57:07.132
She's nothing but trouble.

57:13.109 --> 57:15.407
Master, I did not do it.

57:19.515 --> 57:21.380
Help me.

57:31.561 --> 57:34.121
Please.
Let me look for you.

57:35.164 --> 57:36.290
Papa?

57:36.332 --> 57:38.857
- Father?
Don't!

57:38.901 --> 57:41.028
Leave it alone. I'll find it.
Please, sir.

57:41.103 --> 57:43.264
What's going on?
What are you doing?

57:46.742 --> 57:48.232
Stop it!

57:48.311 --> 57:49.505
For heaven's sake,

57:49.545 --> 57:51.274
you're scaring the children.

57:54.183 --> 57:55.548
What are you doing?

58:09.599 --> 58:11.362
Cornelia.

58:35.291 --> 58:37.020
She's dishonest.

58:37.059 --> 58:39.823
Always sneaking around.
Shirking her work.

58:42.064 --> 58:44.259
Tanneke has complained of it.

58:44.300 --> 58:46.461
Creeping upstairs all day long.

58:46.502 --> 58:51.030
My daughter is right,
there has been too much sneaking about.

58:51.107 --> 58:53.166
I only took her
out of charity.

58:53.242 --> 58:56.177
- If I thought she'd be...
- With another child due

58:56.212 --> 58:57.941
we need the extra help.

58:58.981 --> 59:00.073
Fit in all your work

59:00.116 --> 59:03.574
and do not slack
or it will be the worst for you.

59:05.121 --> 59:07.419
I shall invite Master Van Ruijven.

59:07.456 --> 59:10.425
Johannes must have
a new commission.

59:12.828 --> 59:14.193
Get back to work.

59:37.186 --> 59:39.279
All these girls.

59:39.322 --> 59:42.849
The boys will soon
be swarming around like flies.

59:42.892 --> 59:45.087
I tell you, if I was
a few years younger...

59:45.127 --> 59:48.460
A connoisseur in everything,
Master Van Ruijven.

59:48.497 --> 59:53.696
But you should be faithful
to one mistress above all others...

59:55.004 --> 59:56.596
Art.

59:56.672 --> 1:00:00.608
Your name will surely be famed
as one of the great patrons.

1:00:00.676 --> 1:00:04.009
With your exquisite taste,

1:00:04.046 --> 1:00:08.039
your subtle understanding
of allegory and allusion...

1:00:08.084 --> 1:00:11.713
No, no, stop it, stop it. My God, woman,
you could sell sour milk to cows.

1:00:11.754 --> 1:00:14.188
Now what is it you want?

1:00:14.223 --> 1:00:15.781
A group painting.

1:00:15.825 --> 1:00:18.385
Yourself and Emilie.

1:00:18.427 --> 1:00:20.520
Your lovely daughter too.

1:00:22.031 --> 1:00:23.760
Or...

1:00:23.799 --> 1:00:26.097
a merry company.

1:00:26.135 --> 1:00:27.864
Wine...

1:00:27.937 --> 1:00:29.871
a good meal on your table.

1:00:29.905 --> 1:00:32.874
Your friends all about.
Music.

1:00:32.908 --> 1:00:36.071
- And dancing.
- It's better. Better, better.

1:00:36.112 --> 1:00:37.579
I'll take your bait.

1:00:37.647 --> 1:00:39.945
The picture, several figures.

1:00:39.982 --> 1:00:44.316
A merry gathering,
but no family portrait.

1:00:44.353 --> 1:00:49.518
And if I'm to spend
tedious hours sitting

1:00:49.558 --> 1:00:53.085
I want something
I can rest my eyes on.

1:00:53.129 --> 1:00:55.962
I think she ought to be
in the painting.

1:00:56.999 --> 1:00:59.467
A tavern scene.
It will make a change for you.

1:00:59.502 --> 1:01:02.403
Griet could come and serve me.

1:01:05.074 --> 1:01:06.439
Look at her, man.

1:01:06.475 --> 1:01:09.342
How hard is it
to paint a pretty girl?

1:01:11.714 --> 1:01:12.976
Can I have her?

1:01:45.314 --> 1:01:47.407
Griet, there's been talk
of you.

1:01:50.352 --> 1:01:51.649
I've done nothing.

1:01:51.687 --> 1:01:56.215
Van Ruijven's cook says
you're to be painted with her master.

1:01:56.258 --> 1:02:00.627
You'll have heard about him and the maid
that was painted before?

1:02:04.266 --> 1:02:06.996
- You shouldn't believe gossip.
- Oh, I don't.

1:02:08.504 --> 1:02:10.529
I'll tell Pieter
you asked after him.

1:02:13.175 --> 1:02:14.142
Liver?

1:02:14.210 --> 1:02:15.677
Griet.

1:02:15.711 --> 1:02:17.406
You've heard?

1:02:17.446 --> 1:02:18.572
I heard.

1:02:19.882 --> 1:02:22.043
No smoke without fire,
they say.

1:02:25.387 --> 1:02:26.786
- Is that what you think?
- No.

1:02:28.824 --> 1:02:30.849
You're only a maid,
what can you do?

1:02:32.495 --> 1:02:35.089
- I must get back.
- Don't walk away. Listen to me.

1:02:38.601 --> 1:02:40.592
Just remember who you are.

1:02:42.772 --> 1:02:44.706
Don't get caught up
in his world.

1:02:45.775 --> 1:02:47.504
I am only a maid,

1:02:47.543 --> 1:02:50.137
but I would never give in
to Master Van Ruijven.

1:02:50.179 --> 1:02:51.976
I wasn't talking
about Van Ruijven.

1:03:05.161 --> 1:03:06.958
Ah, you girl, Griet.

1:03:06.996 --> 1:03:08.554
Come here.

1:03:08.597 --> 1:03:11.259
What were you doing today?
I missed you.

1:03:13.102 --> 1:03:14.091
We both did.

1:03:14.170 --> 1:03:18.630
I hear you've been of great use
to your master, pretty Griet.

1:03:18.707 --> 1:03:21.904
All that grinding and stirring, eh?

1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:26.541
Master and maid.

1:03:26.582 --> 1:03:29.050
It's a tune we all know.

1:03:30.619 --> 1:03:34.453
And you can practice together now
that we've made our bargain. Eh, Jan?

1:03:36.225 --> 1:03:37.988
You won't forget, will you?

1:03:39.662 --> 1:03:40.754
Good.

1:04:10.593 --> 1:04:12.720
- What should I...?
- No.

1:04:14.697 --> 1:04:18.098
No. I already... already begun
a group painting.

1:04:20.803 --> 1:04:23.829
You're not to sit with Master
Van Ruijven, that much is agreed.

1:04:26.508 --> 1:04:27.975
Thank you, sir.

1:04:31.013 --> 1:04:32.480
I'm to paint you alone.

1:04:50.232 --> 1:04:53.793
My daughter must not hear
of this other painting in her condition.

1:04:57.873 --> 1:05:00.740
It's to hang
in his private cabinet.

1:05:02.878 --> 1:05:04.903
He's no fool,
mind you.

1:05:04.947 --> 1:05:08.246
An he won't be taken for one,
so don't think otherwise.

1:05:11.053 --> 1:05:13.681
<i>You're a fly in his web.</i>

1:05:16.592 --> 1:05:18.685
<i>We all are.</i>

1:05:27.269 --> 1:05:30.238
You've to admit, my friend,
French swords are the best.

1:05:37.746 --> 1:05:38.713
Tomorrow morning.

1:05:40.983 --> 1:05:42.917
I cannot, I have work.

1:05:42.952 --> 1:05:45.386
Find a way.

1:06:08.744 --> 1:06:10.712
The front of your cap,
fold it back.

1:06:29.531 --> 1:06:31.328
Take off your cap.

1:06:37.873 --> 1:06:39.306
No, sir.

1:06:39.341 --> 1:06:41.206
<i>I cannot.</i>

1:06:41.243 --> 1:06:43.973
Cannot?

1:06:44.013 --> 1:06:45.480
I will not.

1:06:46.515 --> 1:06:48.676
<i>I need to see
your face.</i>

1:06:48.717 --> 1:06:50.708
The cap covers too much.

1:06:59.661 --> 1:07:01.856
There's some cloth
in the storeroom.

1:08:12.101 --> 1:08:15.832
You know, I've a mind to go up there
one day and surprise him

1:08:15.904 --> 1:08:17.201
in the act.

1:08:20.576 --> 1:08:22.976
But you said yourself
it's very dull.

1:08:23.011 --> 1:08:25.343
Oh, not with Emilie

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:28.611
when he's alone with some
young beauty.

1:08:30.886 --> 1:08:33.650
Have you ever notice how
he never bothers with old women?

1:08:33.689 --> 1:08:36.522
Only the young pretty ones.

1:08:36.558 --> 1:08:38.219
On their own.

1:08:38.260 --> 1:08:40.023
You'll have to wait then.

1:08:42.331 --> 1:08:44.526
He makes only one painting
at a time.

1:08:45.567 --> 1:08:47.501
<i>Is that so?</i>

1:09:32.114 --> 1:09:33.240
<i>Jan?</i>

1:09:35.617 --> 1:09:38.450
Jan?
My necklace.

1:10:23.899 --> 1:10:26.094
Haven't you finished yet?

1:10:39.881 --> 1:10:41.610
I'll be in my studio
until dinner.

1:10:55.230 --> 1:10:56.959
Open your mouth.

1:11:00.636 --> 1:11:02.263
Sir?

1:11:02.337 --> 1:11:04.032
Open your mouth.

1:11:08.577 --> 1:11:09.737
Less.

1:11:13.448 --> 1:11:15.643
Now lick your lips.

1:11:28.063 --> 1:11:29.428
Again.

1:11:48.183 --> 1:11:49.741
Again.

1:11:54.122 --> 1:11:55.885
Got you, got you, got you!

1:12:28.990 --> 1:12:30.855
Wear these.

1:12:46.408 --> 1:12:47.739
Good.

1:12:59.054 --> 1:13:00.248
Look, Griet.

1:13:01.890 --> 1:13:04.620
Point of light in the shadow of the neck
leading the eye.

1:13:04.659 --> 1:13:05.648
Jan.

1:13:14.302 --> 1:13:15.667
Sir.

1:13:15.737 --> 1:13:18.797
- Do not ask this of me.
- It's needed.

1:13:18.874 --> 1:13:21.206
The composition,
it's not balanced.

1:13:21.243 --> 1:13:23.177
I've seen you paint
with no one there.

1:13:23.211 --> 1:13:25.475
You want me to imagine
how the earring would look?

1:13:25.514 --> 1:13:27.175
My ears are not pierced.

1:13:35.891 --> 1:13:38.189
She'll find out.

1:13:44.099 --> 1:13:45.828
This has to be, Griet.

1:13:48.136 --> 1:13:49.626
See for yourself.

1:14:07.389 --> 1:14:09.755
You looked inside me.

1:15:08.884 --> 1:15:10.249
I've got you!

1:15:12.053 --> 1:15:14.749
Now hold still.
I want to look at you.

1:15:16.424 --> 1:15:17.652
Now, girl...

1:15:17.692 --> 1:15:21.184
tell me how you get on
up there.

1:15:21.229 --> 1:15:23.595
Has he found his composition?

1:15:23.632 --> 1:15:26.658
Do you move him?
Do you inspire him?

1:15:26.701 --> 1:15:31.001
Tell me, has the master's brush
unlocked the secrets of your heart?

1:15:35.377 --> 1:15:38.369
Ripe as a plum...
still unplucked.

1:15:38.446 --> 1:15:40.243
What's he playing at?

1:15:41.249 --> 1:15:45.549
He made a bargain with me.
He's painting you at my pleasure.

1:15:51.026 --> 1:15:54.518
- No!
- I've waited long enough.

1:15:54.563 --> 1:15:57.191
What a great fool he is.

1:15:58.533 --> 1:16:00.262
Don't fight.

1:16:06.007 --> 1:16:07.133
No! No!

1:16:07.208 --> 1:16:09.005
<i>Griet?</i>

1:16:12.714 --> 1:16:15.205
Not a word.

1:16:15.250 --> 1:16:17.377
You'll lose your place.

1:16:20.889 --> 1:16:22.686
He won't look at you again.

1:16:23.892 --> 1:16:25.257
<i>Griet!</i>

1:16:28.530 --> 1:16:30.327
Ah, there you are, my dear.

1:16:30.365 --> 1:16:33.493
The maid
kept me talking with some...

1:16:33.535 --> 1:16:35.435
cock and bull story.

1:17:16.211 --> 1:17:17.508
Well, girl?

1:17:19.681 --> 1:17:21.239
What's to be done?

1:17:22.717 --> 1:17:25.208
Master Van Ruijven
wants his paintings...

1:17:25.253 --> 1:17:27.278
and he will bear no more delay.

1:17:29.057 --> 1:17:31.548
If he crosses Van Ruijven over this...

1:17:31.593 --> 1:17:33.686
he will lose him.

1:17:33.728 --> 1:17:35.889
Then what?

1:18:02.323 --> 1:18:03.915
My daughter is out for the day.

1:18:06.695 --> 1:18:08.629
Do it now.

1:18:57.979 --> 1:18:59.446
You do it.

1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:47.417
Look at me.

1:20:47.455 --> 1:20:49.719
Now turn your head,
not your shoulders.

1:20:52.026 --> 1:20:53.493
Look at me.

1:20:59.234 --> 1:21:00.701
There, that's it.

1:22:09.904 --> 1:22:11.064
I'll see you later.

1:23:02.357 --> 1:23:04.154
Don't rush away,
Griet, please.

1:23:07.328 --> 1:23:09.228
Leave the house.

1:23:09.263 --> 1:23:12.130
Join me and Paul
in the meat market.

1:23:12.166 --> 1:23:13.895
- I must get back.
- I'll fetch your things,

1:23:13.935 --> 1:23:15.300
I'll send someone.

1:23:15.370 --> 1:23:16.860
No.

1:23:16.938 --> 1:23:21.773
Our own life, Griet...
answering to no one.

1:23:23.544 --> 1:23:25.409
Marry me.

1:24:40.455 --> 1:24:42.218
<i>Laughing at me
in my own house.</i>

1:24:42.256 --> 1:24:45.817
<i>I will see for myself.
No one will stop me.</i>

1:24:45.860 --> 1:24:48.351
<i>There is nothing to see.
You're making yourself ridiculous.</i>

1:24:48.396 --> 1:24:49.488
<i>Calm, my dear.</i>

1:24:49.530 --> 1:24:52.055
<i>I will not be calm!</i>

1:24:52.100 --> 1:24:53.795
<i>Am I a child?!</i>

1:24:54.936 --> 1:24:57.166
Does no one speak the truth to me
in my own house?

1:24:57.238 --> 1:25:00.730
By all the saints, if you would stop
screaming for a moment, I can explain.

1:25:00.808 --> 1:25:01.934
More lies?!

1:25:02.009 --> 1:25:05.445
I don't want to hear
any more of your lies, Mother.

1:25:05.513 --> 1:25:07.981
I have a right to know.

1:25:16.591 --> 1:25:18.081
So.

1:25:20.962 --> 1:25:22.691
No more hiding now.

1:25:22.730 --> 1:25:24.891
Here I am.

1:25:26.367 --> 1:25:28.767
I want to see this painting.

1:25:31.372 --> 1:25:33.169
There's no point.

1:25:33.241 --> 1:25:35.675
No point?!

1:25:37.478 --> 1:25:40.641
I am too stupid to look
at a painting now?

1:25:43.918 --> 1:25:47.217
She can't read!
You know that?

1:25:47.255 --> 1:25:49.780
Sit down.
You'll exhaust yourself.

1:25:49.824 --> 1:25:50.882
Why can't I look?

1:25:50.925 --> 1:25:54.019
It's just a commission. Gone
in a few days. You need never see it.

1:25:57.565 --> 1:25:59.123
They are just paintings.

1:25:59.167 --> 1:26:02.694
Pictures, for money.
They mean nothing.

1:26:11.612 --> 1:26:14.410
Is it true she wore my pearls?

1:26:22.557 --> 1:26:24.582
How could you?

1:26:28.696 --> 1:26:30.288
How could you?

1:26:41.042 --> 1:26:42.907
Show me this painting.

1:26:42.944 --> 1:26:44.809
You'll make yourself ill.

1:26:44.845 --> 1:26:46.745
You show me.

1:27:14.642 --> 1:27:16.610
It's obscene.

1:27:27.722 --> 1:27:29.849
Why don't you paint me?

1:27:29.890 --> 1:27:31.482
Because you don't understand!

1:27:32.526 --> 1:27:34.585
And she does?

1:28:02.423 --> 1:28:05.790
No!
Get out of here!

1:28:10.865 --> 1:28:12.958
Get out of my house!

1:31:43.310 --> 1:31:45.039
I've come
to the right place, then.

1:31:45.079 --> 1:31:46.410
Tanneke?

1:31:51.018 --> 1:31:52.645
This is for you.
