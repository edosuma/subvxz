Witches of East End:

00:02.732 --> 00:04.832
INGRID:
As long as the doll stays
under water

00:04.865 --> 00:06.365
no one will ever find the body.

00:06.398 --> 00:08.798
I don't want this thing
to end between us.

00:08.832 --> 00:11.032
I can't put you in danger.
I'm not gonna leave you.

00:11.065 --> 00:12.865
We can't keep killing
random people.

00:12.898 --> 00:14.332
We have to find someone
who trusts you.

00:14.365 --> 00:16.165
Do you trust me?

00:17.598 --> 00:19.032
I promise
you won't feel a thing.

00:19.065 --> 00:22.065
I don't want you to die, too.

00:22.098 --> 00:25.332
I love you, Mama.

00:25.365 --> 00:27.232
I love you, too,
baby girl.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.365
(recording):
Hey, it's Ingrid.

00:34.398 --> 00:36.032
Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

00:36.065 --> 00:38.865
I don't want to leave a message,
I want to talk to you!

00:55.598 --> 00:57.065
(grunts)

01:16.865 --> 01:19.698
♪ ♪

01:42.198 --> 01:45.165
I still feel numb.

01:45.198 --> 01:47.232
It's strange, but...

01:47.265 --> 01:48.565
I kind of like it.

01:48.598 --> 01:51.198
Just lie still.

01:51.232 --> 01:54.232
(chants):
Gaja ert ufi gest.

01:54.265 --> 01:55.765
(laughs)

01:57.365 --> 01:58.498
Is that Danish?

01:59.932 --> 02:02.098
All right,
I'll be quiet.

02:03.365 --> 02:04.698
Do whatever you want.

02:05.765 --> 02:07.065
I'm not afraid.

02:07.098 --> 02:09.198
I trust you, Freddie.

02:24.165 --> 02:27.332
(grunts)
You didn't complete
the ritual.

02:27.365 --> 02:28.632
Caroline is still alive

02:28.665 --> 02:31.632
and well.

02:31.665 --> 02:34.998
Which is strange, because
according to our plan,

02:35.032 --> 02:37.298
she should either be dead

02:37.332 --> 02:39.698
or the living vessel
of our king.

02:39.732 --> 02:41.232
(screams)

02:41.265 --> 02:43.065
But, instead,

02:43.098 --> 02:44.732
she's home,

02:44.765 --> 02:47.332
asleep in bed.

02:47.365 --> 02:50.698
You didn't do what
you were supposed to do.

02:50.732 --> 02:52.332
I'm done working with you.

02:52.365 --> 02:55.465
I'm done taking orders.
I'm not giving them any more.

02:55.498 --> 02:57.865
I'm taking matters
into my own hands.

02:57.898 --> 02:59.898
I won't let you hurt Caroline.
I don't need her.

02:59.932 --> 03:02.198
I've found someone...

03:02.232 --> 03:03.198
much better.

03:03.232 --> 03:07.332
Who?

03:07.365 --> 03:09.565
But first,
you need to be taught...

03:09.598 --> 03:11.298
a lesson.

03:11.332 --> 03:15.432
(kettle whistling)

03:19.265 --> 03:21.398
(door slams)

03:25.332 --> 03:26.498
Mom?

03:26.532 --> 03:28.232
Frederick, my God!

03:28.265 --> 03:29.698
(faintly):
Help me.

03:33.365 --> 03:35.632
I'm sorry!
We don't open for another hour.

03:35.665 --> 03:36.898
It's me, Ingrid.

03:36.932 --> 03:38.232
Freya?

03:39.998 --> 03:41.132
Okay.

03:41.165 --> 03:42.498
I've had three
shots of espresso

03:42.532 --> 03:43.898
because I couldn't
sleep last night.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.498
So, either I'm starting
to lose my mind,

03:45.532 --> 03:47.398
or everything is
suddenly, totally clear.

03:47.432 --> 03:48.732
Good morning.

03:48.765 --> 03:50.498
No, not "good morning."
The worst morning.

03:50.532 --> 03:52.365
I would offer you coffee,
but I think you've had enough.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.632
What happened?

03:53.665 --> 03:55.632
I had sex with Killian
last night.

03:55.665 --> 03:57.532
What?!
Oh, Freya!

03:57.565 --> 03:59.132
Don't "Oh, Freya" me!

03:59.165 --> 04:01.665
Skip the judgment, okay.
I feel awful enough right now.

04:01.698 --> 04:02.565
Okay, sorry.
I'm not judging.

04:02.598 --> 04:04.298
I swear.

04:04.332 --> 04:06.298
So, what happened? Was it bad?
Is that why you're so upset?

04:06.332 --> 04:09.065
No! It was incredible.

04:09.098 --> 04:11.132
Hot. Emotional. Intense.

04:11.165 --> 04:12.865
It was beautiful.

04:12.898 --> 04:14.998
Exactly like I always thought
it would be.

04:15.032 --> 04:16.465
Well, that's
great, except‐‐

04:16.498 --> 04:17.698
and no judgment, but...

04:17.732 --> 04:19.198
I know he's married.
...he's married.

04:19.232 --> 04:20.665
Which makes it wrong.

04:20.698 --> 04:21.632
But!

04:21.665 --> 04:23.232
He loves me, Ingrid.

04:23.265 --> 04:24.965
He told me last night that he
still dreams about me,

04:24.998 --> 04:26.665
and that he wants to be with me.

04:26.698 --> 04:28.665
So, he's leaving Eva?
No.

04:28.698 --> 04:30.132
See, that's the thing
that makes no sense.

04:30.165 --> 04:31.632
So, after we were together,

04:31.665 --> 04:33.498
he went to tell her
that he wanted a divorce.

04:33.532 --> 04:37.565
But then when he came back to
the bar, he changed his mind.

04:37.598 --> 04:40.332
Oh, Freya. I'm so sorry.

04:40.365 --> 04:42.398
I just don't understand
what is happening.

04:42.432 --> 04:45.032
Well, there's always been a
tension between you guys.

04:45.065 --> 04:46.832
It had to get released
at some point.

04:46.865 --> 04:49.665
But you said you saw
his aura, and he...

04:49.698 --> 04:50.698
loves her, too.

04:50.732 --> 04:52.065
She is his wife.

04:52.098 --> 04:53.532
But she's also a witch.

04:53.565 --> 04:54.832
She is?
Yeah, yeah!

04:54.865 --> 04:56.398
Which is why
none of this adds up.

04:56.432 --> 04:58.165
What do you mean?

04:58.198 --> 04:59.665
What are the odds that he just
happened to change his mind

04:59.698 --> 05:00.732
about leaving her for me?

05:00.765 --> 05:02.398
She did something to him.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.032
Some sort of spell to make him
think that he loves her,

05:05.065 --> 05:06.732
and forget that he loves me.

05:06.765 --> 05:07.798
I don't know, sweetie.

05:07.832 --> 05:09.398
You sound a little...

05:09.432 --> 05:12.032
I am not crazy.
This makes perfect sense to me.

05:12.065 --> 05:13.632
She's messing with his mind.

05:13.665 --> 05:15.332
Why else would they have
gotten married so fast, huh?

05:15.365 --> 05:17.965
Because he's in
love with her?

05:17.998 --> 05:20.332
And she's beautiful, intelligent
and really, really sweet?

05:20.365 --> 05:21.665
She is not sweet.

05:21.698 --> 05:22.632
She is up to something.

05:22.665 --> 05:23.632
I can feel it.

05:23.665 --> 05:25.132
I just have to find proof.

05:25.165 --> 05:26.898
Okay, now you're scaring me.
Just a little bit.

05:26.932 --> 05:28.198
You sound like
a crazy stalker lady.

05:28.232 --> 05:30.165
No, I am a smart stalker lady.

05:30.198 --> 05:31.798
And a badass witch.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.532
Once I figure out
what she's up to,

05:33.565 --> 05:35.365
Eva's not gonna know
what hit her.

05:35.398 --> 05:37.165
(dings)

05:37.198 --> 05:39.365
(dinging resonates)

05:40.432 --> 05:42.532
(wind chimes tinkling)

05:42.565 --> 05:45.065
(Tommy chuckles)

05:45.098 --> 05:46.465
WENDY (giggling):
That tickles.

05:46.498 --> 05:47.832
TOMMY: Mm‐hmm.

05:47.865 --> 05:49.398
How's this?

05:52.232 --> 05:53.532
That's better.

05:55.098 --> 05:56.498
You're making
my inner kitty purr.

05:56.532 --> 05:57.465
(imitates cat)

05:57.498 --> 06:00.165
(giggles)

06:02.265 --> 06:06.065
So, what's next?

06:06.098 --> 06:08.498
I was thinking pancakes,

06:08.532 --> 06:11.465
and bacon, and coffee,

06:11.498 --> 06:13.998
No, no...
and maybe some orange juice.

06:14.032 --> 06:16.632
What's next for us?

06:16.665 --> 06:19.365
Now that melting my brain
is off the table.

06:19.398 --> 06:23.165
And we're staying together
even though I know you're...

06:23.198 --> 06:26.898
a witch.

06:26.932 --> 06:29.498
Damn. I'm never get used
to saying that.

06:29.532 --> 06:31.065
Don't!

06:32.332 --> 06:34.565
It's better if you try not to...

06:34.598 --> 06:37.465
say it. Ever.
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna tell

06:37.498 --> 06:39.298
anyone.
No, I know that you won't,

06:39.332 --> 06:41.965
but my sister is gonna
have a nuclear meltdown

06:41.998 --> 06:43.198
when she finds out.

06:43.232 --> 06:45.332
So, we have to proceed
with caution.

06:45.365 --> 06:47.232
(whispering):
Extreme caution.

06:47.265 --> 06:48.832
Yeah.

06:53.732 --> 06:55.732
WENDY:
Oh, my God.

06:55.765 --> 06:57.498
Is that the time?
(gasps)

06:57.532 --> 06:59.465
My sister is going to be up.
Okay.

06:59.498 --> 07:02.665
We're gonna have to figure out
a plan to get you out of here.

07:02.698 --> 07:05.865
Maybe we can ask her
to join us.

07:08.898 --> 07:10.398
You jerk.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.232
(grunts, laughs)

07:14.265 --> 07:16.832
Okay.

07:18.098 --> 07:19.332
I'll distract her.

07:19.365 --> 07:22.865
And just to be safe,

07:22.898 --> 07:24.965
wait ten minutes,

07:24.998 --> 07:27.532
and then sneak
out the garden.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.032
(low muttering)

08:01.732 --> 08:03.198
JOANNA:
You were with Tommy last night.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.565
You didn't spell
him, did you?

08:05.598 --> 08:07.332
How'd you know?

08:07.365 --> 08:08.865
(laughs gently)

08:08.898 --> 08:11.298
Okay, just...
Joanna, keep an open mind.

08:11.332 --> 08:13.398
You need to deal with it.

08:14.565 --> 08:16.532
We've got other problems.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.498
What?

08:20.732 --> 08:22.732
JOANNA:
How are you feeling?

08:22.765 --> 08:24.732
Better.
Thank you for healing me.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.398
Here, sip this.
Be careful, it's hot.

08:26.432 --> 08:27.632
What happened?

08:27.665 --> 08:28.998
I was attacked.
By Mason Tarkoff.

08:29.032 --> 08:30.732
What?
I thought he was your friend.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.198
So did I.

08:32.232 --> 08:33.865
I've known him my entire life.

08:33.898 --> 08:36.532
Wait, he fought on our side
during the rebellion.

08:36.565 --> 08:37.998
He pretended to.

08:38.032 --> 08:39.465
He's still working
for the king.

08:39.498 --> 08:41.398
He's a telepath.

08:41.432 --> 08:42.998
The most powerful one
I've ever met.

08:43.032 --> 08:44.665
They've been communicating
for centuries.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.332
Tarkoff's been monitoring
things this side

08:46.365 --> 08:47.898
of the portal and reporting
back to the king

08:47.932 --> 08:49.665
ever since we arrived.

08:49.698 --> 08:51.798
My cloaking spell kept him
out of town until now.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.965
He tried to get me

08:52.998 --> 08:53.965
to help him, and,
when I refused,

08:53.998 --> 08:55.198
he tried to kill me.

08:55.232 --> 08:57.232
Why?
What did he need your help with?

08:57.265 --> 08:59.832
He's trying to find a body
for the king to inhabit.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.532
Grandfather's been sick
for years.

09:04.565 --> 09:06.632
His mind and his magic
are as strong as ever,

09:06.665 --> 09:08.398
but his body is
deteriorated and weak.

09:08.432 --> 09:12.465
He couldn't make it through
the portal even if he wanted to.

09:12.498 --> 09:14.165
JOANNA:
That's what the Mandragora
was doing here.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.832
He was looking for a host body
for the king's spirit.

09:16.865 --> 09:20.198
Well, we have to kill Tarkoff.
I tried to kill him
as soon as I realized

09:20.232 --> 09:23.898
what he was doing, but it didn't
work 'cause he's a telepath.

09:23.932 --> 09:25.998
He read my mind
and knew what I was up to.

09:28.398 --> 09:30.298
I think maybe
you could do it, Mom.

09:30.332 --> 09:31.965
You have a powerful mind,

09:31.998 --> 09:34.498
one that could confuse even
the most gifted telepath.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.165
I think you could stop him.

09:37.198 --> 09:39.498
Maybe even kill him.

10:17.405 --> 10:20.072
Oh, sí, I know mi'hijita.

10:20.105 --> 10:22.072
But no matter what happens,

10:22.105 --> 10:24.272
you will always be
my favorite child.

10:35.405 --> 10:39.372
Al egun les pido.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.472
Concedeme lo que busco.

10:41.505 --> 10:44.805
Dame un nino para poder

10:44.838 --> 10:48.005
seguir viviendo.

10:56.738 --> 10:58.072
Gracias, egun.

10:58.105 --> 10:59.572
(gasps, laughs)

10:59.605 --> 11:02.672
(chuckles, grunts)

11:11.738 --> 11:13.438
Ay, no, Mama...
(gasps, sniffles)

11:13.472 --> 11:16.005
(sniffles)

11:19.505 --> 11:22.905
I think I just need to
be alone for a while.

11:22.938 --> 11:25.338
(trembling):
I'm gonna take a walk.

11:30.138 --> 11:31.305
You see how

11:31.338 --> 11:32.438
your mother's
not talking?

11:32.472 --> 11:33.605
How she has an
intense look

11:33.638 --> 11:34.705
in her eyes?

11:34.738 --> 11:35.938
Means she's
getting ready

11:35.972 --> 11:37.872
to kick some ass.
Quiet, Wendy.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.638
I love when she
gets this way.

11:39.672 --> 11:40.738
JOANNA:
I've known Tarkoff

11:40.772 --> 11:42.072
since I was 16 years old.

11:42.105 --> 11:44.305
I always confided in him.

11:44.338 --> 11:45.972
He used to protect me.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.372
Really thought
that I knew him.

11:47.405 --> 11:48.972
It was all a lie.

11:49.005 --> 11:50.972
FREDERICK:
I'm sorry, Mom.

11:51.005 --> 11:53.038
You can't always trust
the ones you love.

11:53.072 --> 11:54.605
(gasps)

11:54.638 --> 11:57.305
I told you
she meant business.

11:57.338 --> 11:59.605
Death scorpions.
What's a
death scorpion?

11:59.638 --> 12:01.305
They're in stasis now,
but I can revive them.

12:01.338 --> 12:02.638
And he won't
see them coming,

12:02.672 --> 12:04.238
because he doesn't know
what they are,

12:04.272 --> 12:05.705
because we're the ones
who invented the spell.

12:05.738 --> 12:06.805
The first sting
will paralyze you

12:06.838 --> 12:08.272
and the second will kill you.

12:08.305 --> 12:10.372
Even if you're
a telepathic warlock asshole.

12:10.405 --> 12:12.072
I don't want to kill him yet.

12:12.105 --> 12:13.438
The venom will paralyze him

12:13.472 --> 12:14.738
for a couple of hours.

12:14.772 --> 12:15.705
It's enough time for us

12:15.738 --> 12:17.105
to find out his plans.

12:17.138 --> 12:18.272
FREDERICK:
Only problem is,

12:18.305 --> 12:20.838
we don't know how
to find Tarkoff.

12:22.905 --> 12:25.472
Or maybe we do.

12:52.738 --> 12:55.305
♪ ♪

13:12.338 --> 13:15.005
You are a crazy stalker‐lady.

13:24.772 --> 13:26.038
Ugh.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.238
(coughing)

13:27.272 --> 13:28.972

Ingrid.

14:02.172 --> 14:03.138
Dash, what are you
doing here?

14:03.172 --> 14:04.205
All right, look...

14:04.238 --> 14:05.238
we need to talk.

14:05.272 --> 14:07.005
We have nothing
to talk about.

14:11.438 --> 14:12.605
(gasps)

14:15.338 --> 14:16.705
Where did you find this?

14:16.738 --> 14:17.905
Fair Haven.

14:17.938 --> 14:19.205
In the attic.
It was hidden with

14:19.238 --> 14:20.205
a bunch of things
that belonged to

14:20.238 --> 14:22.205
Archibald Browning.

14:22.238 --> 14:23.405
It is you...

14:23.438 --> 14:24.572
isn't it?

14:24.605 --> 14:25.872
I mean, he talks
about you

14:25.905 --> 14:27.038
in his journals,
he calls you Ingrid.

14:27.072 --> 14:30.238
It is me.

14:30.272 --> 14:32.038
And it's not me.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.138
It's hard to explain.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.738
So, you read the journals?

14:35.772 --> 14:37.938
Some of them.

14:37.972 --> 14:39.272
Uh, some parts are written
in another language‐‐

14:39.305 --> 14:40.438
I‐I can't make it out‐‐

14:40.472 --> 14:41.805
but some parts
are in English.

14:42.905 --> 14:44.705
They're all about you.

14:44.738 --> 14:45.972
He loved you.

14:46.005 --> 14:47.905
And... and he thought...
you loved him.

14:47.938 --> 14:49.205
And I'm a little confused

14:49.238 --> 14:50.938
right now, because...

14:52.272 --> 14:53.272
...all of this happened over

14:53.305 --> 14:55.238
a hundred years ago.

14:55.272 --> 14:57.372
Okay.

14:57.405 --> 15:00.072
I guess we do need to talk.

15:01.805 --> 15:02.972
All right,

15:03.005 --> 15:04.138
we need you
and Frederick

15:04.172 --> 15:05.305
to do your
astral projection

15:05.338 --> 15:06.305
wonder‐twin‐magic.

15:06.338 --> 15:07.538
Find Tarkoff before

15:07.572 --> 15:09.272
he can find a host
for the king.

15:09.305 --> 15:10.372
What?

15:10.405 --> 15:11.405
I don't think
we should do this,

15:11.438 --> 15:12.438
it might be dangerous.

15:12.472 --> 15:13.438
FREYA (sighs):
Why? Why?

15:13.472 --> 15:14.538
We won't
actually be there,

15:14.572 --> 15:15.805
it's just our
thought‐bodies.

15:15.838 --> 15:17.038
What is Tarkoff
senses us?

15:17.072 --> 15:18.705
Even if he does,
he can't touch us.

15:18.738 --> 15:20.572
JOANNA:
Freya, before you go.

15:20.605 --> 15:22.805
Oh, Joanna,
really?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.472
A travel talisman?
We have to hurry.

15:24.505 --> 15:25.938
I don't like my children

15:25.972 --> 15:27.305
both going into the lion's den

15:27.338 --> 15:29.638
without protection.

15:29.672 --> 15:31.438
Especially when that
lion is the king.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.372
Now, once you
find out where he is,

15:33.405 --> 15:34.638
you get back here
immediately

15:34.672 --> 15:35.772
and Wendy and I

15:35.805 --> 15:37.638
will take care
of the rest.

15:37.672 --> 15:39.038

You ready?

That makes you...

the perfect candidate to take on

17:26.505 --> 17:28.638

I remove it...

Freya, it's not
what you think.
What?

17:51.545 --> 17:53.078
Freya.

17:53.112 --> 17:54.512
Get away from me!

17:54.545 --> 17:55.645
Tarkoff has Tommy!

17:55.678 --> 17:56.745
What?!
What happened?

17:56.778 --> 17:57.945
Give me a chance
to explain.

17:57.978 --> 17:59.178
I can't believe
we trusted you.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.678
Where are they?
Where's Tommy?

18:00.712 --> 18:02.078
At that old
abandoned hospital,

18:02.112 --> 18:03.478
St. Gabriel's.
Freya, what happened?

18:03.512 --> 18:04.612
WENDY:
We need to go there now.

18:04.645 --> 18:05.945
Frederick is
in on it!

18:05.978 --> 18:07.278
He's been carrying
Grandfather's spirit

18:07.312 --> 18:08.412
this whole time!

18:08.445 --> 18:09.912
No, you don't understand.

18:09.945 --> 18:10.945
What is there to understand?!

18:10.978 --> 18:12.178
I heard what Tarkoff said.

18:12.212 --> 18:13.445
Is this true?
No, it's not true.

18:13.478 --> 18:14.745
Then why would
he say that?

18:14.778 --> 18:16.078
Because...
because when I... (sighs)

18:16.112 --> 18:17.245
when I first
came through...

18:17.278 --> 18:18.778
I had a plan.

18:18.812 --> 18:20.345
But I realized after being
a part of this family,

18:20.378 --> 18:21.445
that I couldn't do it!

18:21.478 --> 18:22.578
We gave you
another chance

18:22.612 --> 18:23.745
and you betrayed us?!

18:23.778 --> 18:24.778
Please, listen to me!

18:24.812 --> 18:26.945
Expergo!

18:35.978 --> 18:41.112
Freya, go.
Somewhere safe and in public.

18:41.145 --> 18:42.912
Joanna, we need
to go now,

18:42.945 --> 18:44.078
we need to find Tommy

18:44.112 --> 18:45.112
before it's too late.

18:45.145 --> 18:46.112
I'm sorry.

18:46.145 --> 18:47.778
I didn't want to
hurt anyone.

18:47.812 --> 18:49.345
One more sting.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.778
That's all it would take.

18:50.812 --> 18:52.012
No more lies.
WENDY:
Joanna!

18:52.045 --> 18:53.578
Let's go!
I came on a mission,

18:53.612 --> 18:55.445
it's true.
The king sent me

18:55.478 --> 18:57.445
through the portal.
What does he want?

18:57.478 --> 18:58.845
Just to talk to you.

18:58.878 --> 19:00.245
That's all he said.
WENDY:
Oh, please...!

19:00.278 --> 19:01.278
He wants to destroy us.

19:01.312 --> 19:02.412
Just give him
the other sting;

19:02.445 --> 19:03.978
let's end this
right now!

19:04.012 --> 19:05.245
Mom... please...

19:05.278 --> 19:06.345
just listen to me.

19:06.378 --> 19:07.512
Listen to your lies?!

19:07.545 --> 19:08.512
No, no... no!

19:08.545 --> 19:09.812
I'm‐I'm telling you the truth.

19:09.845 --> 19:11.145
I'm telling you the truth.

19:11.178 --> 19:12.345
I‐I've stopped helping...

19:12.378 --> 19:13.845
the king...
all for you.

19:13.878 --> 19:15.945
You should've
hated me years ago

19:15.978 --> 19:17.145
for taking
Grandfather's side...

19:17.178 --> 19:18.678
but you didn't
give up on me.

19:18.712 --> 19:19.978
After all these years,

19:20.012 --> 19:21.678
you've never stopped loving me.

19:21.712 --> 19:22.678
In your mind,

19:22.712 --> 19:24.778
I've always been your son.

19:24.812 --> 19:26.178
(forcing):
You don't know what

19:26.212 --> 19:27.945
that means to me.

19:27.978 --> 19:29.412
And... W‐Wendy...

19:29.445 --> 19:31.912
I know you didn't
trust me at first, but...

19:31.945 --> 19:33.112
y‐you forgave me.

19:33.145 --> 19:34.112
I f‐f‐feel like

19:34.145 --> 19:36.678
I'm a part of this family.

19:37.945 --> 19:39.278
Please.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.578
Oh, please,
we've heard this

19:40.612 --> 19:41.845
all before, Joanna.

19:41.878 --> 19:43.645
Please. We need
to go...

19:43.678 --> 19:45.445
take care of Tarkoff,

19:45.478 --> 19:47.145
so we can get Tommy.

19:47.178 --> 19:49.145
Okay. We'll deal
with you later.

19:49.178 --> 19:50.812
We're gonna
lock your ass in.

20:00.345 --> 20:02.112
DASH:
Okay, so, can you
make out any of it?

20:02.145 --> 20:03.312
INGRID:
A little.

20:03.345 --> 20:04.578
Okay, great.
I mean, this, this is,

20:04.612 --> 20:05.845
this is great, right?

20:05.878 --> 20:06.978
I mean, if these spells
are so powerful...

20:07.012 --> 20:08.478
No! Dash,
this is terrible.

20:08.512 --> 20:10.145
These spells
are dark...

20:10.178 --> 20:11.278
and dangerous

20:11.312 --> 20:12.445
and they are
to be avoided

20:12.478 --> 20:13.478
at all costs.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.845
There's an old saying:

20:14.878 --> 20:16.112
"Words written in blood

20:16.145 --> 20:17.245
draw only blood."

20:17.278 --> 20:19.078
The evil intention
of a spell

20:19.112 --> 20:20.412
is hardwired
into it.

20:20.445 --> 20:22.845
These spells will
stain your soul.

20:22.878 --> 20:24.912
It's evil. Come
to think of it,

20:24.945 --> 20:26.645
so is he.
Okay, but
I don't get it,

20:26.678 --> 20:28.012
how is this even possible

20:28.045 --> 20:29.012
that you knew him?

20:29.045 --> 20:30.078
I mean...

20:30.112 --> 20:31.145
how old are you?

20:31.178 --> 20:32.245
Okay, that is a very

20:32.278 --> 20:33.678
rude question.
Besides...

20:33.712 --> 20:36.078
this wasn't me;
not exactly.

20:36.112 --> 20:38.778
See, Freya and I
have been reborn

20:38.812 --> 20:41.478
over and over again
for centuries,

20:41.512 --> 20:44.145
but we don't remember
any of our past lives.

20:44.178 --> 20:45.278
You're talking about
reincarnation?

20:45.312 --> 20:46.512
Not exactly.

20:46.545 --> 20:48.645
Our mother is cursed‐‐

20:48.678 --> 20:49.912
she never dies‐‐

20:49.945 --> 20:51.112
she just keeps

20:51.145 --> 20:53.645
giving birth to us
again and again.

20:53.678 --> 20:55.612
I think my head
just exploded.

20:55.645 --> 20:57.245
I recently did a spell

20:57.278 --> 20:58.678
and discovered that

20:58.712 --> 21:01.012
in one of my past lives

21:01.045 --> 21:03.612
I was involved with
your grandfather.

21:03.645 --> 21:06.178
I'm sorry. Di...

21:06.212 --> 21:07.645
did you just say my grandfather?

21:07.678 --> 21:09.012
Archibald Browning

21:09.045 --> 21:11.512
was your grandfather.

21:11.545 --> 21:13.812
Your mother was his daughter.

21:13.845 --> 21:16.478
How‐how is that even possible?
I mean, that would make...

21:16.512 --> 21:18.678
that would make my mom
over a hundred years old.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.578
Witches can live
a very long time.

21:21.612 --> 21:24.145
And we don't age the
same as regular people.

21:24.178 --> 21:26.012
No, no, no.
I can't believe this.

21:26.045 --> 21:29.512
So‐so you, you were sleeping
with my grandfather?

21:29.545 --> 21:31.312
Yes. But when I met him,

21:31.345 --> 21:33.078
your mother was already
ten years old.

21:33.112 --> 21:34.578
So there's no way...
Oh, good.

21:34.612 --> 21:36.245
That's great.
I'm so relieved to know

21:36.278 --> 21:38.178
I didn't have sex with
my own grandmother last night.

21:38.212 --> 21:40.945
Dash, I told you this was a
different version of me anyway.

21:40.978 --> 21:42.312
That doesn't make it better!
I'm sorry.

21:42.345 --> 21:43.645
I loved Archibald.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.912
But he led me down
a very dark path.

21:45.945 --> 21:48.012
And it ended up
costing me my life.

21:48.045 --> 21:51.178
What do you mean a dark path?

21:54.278 --> 21:56.278
Oh, my God.

21:56.312 --> 21:57.478
Dash...

21:57.512 --> 22:01.312
We killed a man
and covered it up.

22:01.345 --> 22:03.512
Wait, you‐you
and Archibald?

22:03.545 --> 22:05.345
Yes.

22:05.378 --> 22:07.612
I didn't even see this before.
You and I did the same thing.

22:07.645 --> 22:09.278
The patterns, they're repeating.
Slow down.

22:09.312 --> 22:11.078
Yes! It's just like Freya
and her past lives!

22:11.112 --> 22:12.312
What's happening with us,

22:12.345 --> 22:13.645
it's like me and Archi...
Ingrid!

22:13.678 --> 22:15.278
You're missing
one huge difference!

22:15.312 --> 22:17.312
You said Archibald was evil.

22:17.345 --> 22:20.312
Okay? I'm not.

22:20.345 --> 22:23.345
I want to believe you, Dash.
I really do.

22:23.378 --> 22:26.178
But if that's the truth,
you have to prove it.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.778
Okay.

22:27.812 --> 22:29.945
Okay, great. How?

22:29.978 --> 22:31.412
Okay, we have to
break the pattern.

22:31.445 --> 22:33.478
We have to make sure you do not

22:33.512 --> 22:35.278
turn out like your grandfather.

22:36.612 --> 22:39.278
Dash, you have to
burn these journals.

22:39.312 --> 22:41.878
And forget these
spells ever existed.

22:46.312 --> 22:48.312
Hey. You break
into my apartment?

22:48.345 --> 22:50.778
Yes. But it was
for a good reason.

22:50.812 --> 22:52.578
I told you last night,
Freya, there...

22:52.612 --> 22:54.278
Killian, listen to me.

22:54.312 --> 22:56.078
This isn't about my
feelings for you.

22:56.112 --> 22:57.845
We don't have to be together
if you don't want to.

22:57.878 --> 22:58.845
That's fine.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.478
But I'm worried about you.

23:00.512 --> 23:01.912
I think Eva's

23:01.945 --> 23:03.278
done something to you.
I think she's

23:03.312 --> 23:04.612
messing with your mind.
Freya,

23:04.645 --> 23:05.845
this is sad.
I know. I know

23:05.878 --> 23:07.178
I sound insane
even to myself.

23:07.212 --> 23:08.845
But I also know that I'm right.

23:08.878 --> 23:10.845
I don't know what
she's really up to.

23:10.878 --> 23:13.145
But I know she's trying to
hide the truth from you.

23:13.178 --> 23:15.745
And what truth is that?

23:15.778 --> 23:19.178
That you still love me.

23:21.145 --> 23:22.678
Do you see this?

23:22.712 --> 23:23.978
I found this in your apartment.

23:24.012 --> 23:25.512
So?
This is a powerful potion

23:25.545 --> 23:27.012
named Demon's Breath.

23:27.045 --> 23:28.278
You have vials of potions, too.
Does that mean

23:28.312 --> 23:29.645
you're up to something?

23:29.678 --> 23:30.912
Demon's Breath is an
alchemist's elixir

23:30.945 --> 23:32.745
used for mind control spells.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.445
Eva is not controlling my mind.
If you are

23:34.478 --> 23:36.412
under a spell, of course
you're not gonna believe me.

23:36.445 --> 23:39.245
Okay, wait‐‐ so if I think
you're being paranoid,

23:39.278 --> 23:41.778
that just proves
you're right about Eva?

23:41.812 --> 23:44.012
I am talking to Eva either way.

23:44.045 --> 23:46.945
There's no way I'm letting you
talk to her alone.

23:46.978 --> 23:48.778
I don't trust you
around my wife.

23:54.178 --> 23:56.778
What the hell is
wrong with you?

23:57.712 --> 23:59.845
(grunting)

24:00.878 --> 24:03.945
It should've worked by now.

24:10.378 --> 24:12.178
Good luck in the afterlife.

24:12.212 --> 24:14.812
(gasping)

24:16.645 --> 24:18.278
What is happening to me?!

24:20.945 --> 24:23.645
I was right.

24:23.678 --> 24:26.212
You are the one.

24:36.045 --> 24:37.578
You're doing
the right thing, Dash.

24:37.612 --> 24:38.845
Look, I want

24:38.878 --> 24:40.445
to put all these
terrible things behind me.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.745
I wa... I want to move on.

24:41.778 --> 24:43.012
That's good.

24:43.045 --> 24:44.078
Dash, I'm glad.

24:44.112 --> 24:45.512
But don't do it for me.

24:45.545 --> 24:47.178
Why not? Huh?

24:47.212 --> 24:49.478
I am here to help you.

24:49.512 --> 24:52.512
But you are not gonna be able
to move on until you fix things.

24:52.545 --> 24:54.478
Everything.

24:54.512 --> 24:56.078
Okay, how?

24:56.112 --> 24:58.645
Start by telling
Killian the truth.

24:58.678 --> 25:01.578
I'm not sure that's
such a great idea.

25:01.612 --> 25:03.578
You have to be completely

25:03.612 --> 25:06.178
honest with him.

25:06.212 --> 25:09.512
And you're saying
if I do that...

25:09.545 --> 25:11.745
there's still a chance for us?

25:11.778 --> 25:13.078
No.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.178
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

25:15.212 --> 25:16.912
Dash, if you do that,

25:16.945 --> 25:19.245
there's a chance for you.

25:19.278 --> 25:21.112
Because if you don't,
this is going to haunt you

25:21.145 --> 25:23.712
for the rest of your life.

25:28.878 --> 25:30.778
Eva?

25:36.212 --> 25:38.678
Please, don't
come any closer.

25:40.312 --> 25:42.445
What's wrong, mi amor?

25:44.345 --> 25:46.312
Where's abuela?

25:46.345 --> 25:48.145
She's dead.

25:51.112 --> 25:53.445
I said

25:53.478 --> 25:56.045
don't come any closer.

26:01.678 --> 26:04.212
Eva, what happened?

26:05.678 --> 26:07.745
I've been lying to you.

26:07.778 --> 26:09.945
From the beginning.

26:11.445 --> 26:15.312
I thought you were the
answer to my prayers.

26:15.345 --> 26:17.245
A warlock.

26:17.278 --> 26:20.278
Brought to me
across a beautiful ocean.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.078
I don't understand.

26:23.112 --> 26:25.112
I was born a mortal woman.

26:25.145 --> 26:26.845
Centuries ago.

26:26.878 --> 26:29.645
Until I met a warlock

26:29.678 --> 26:32.845
who offered me powers
and eternal life.

26:32.878 --> 26:35.612
All I had to do was
pledge myself to him.

26:35.645 --> 26:38.612
And in return,
he made me a witch.

26:38.645 --> 26:42.745
Nine months later I was
pregnant with my first child.

26:42.778 --> 26:45.512
The child of a warlock.

26:45.545 --> 26:48.678
As long as I got pregnant
with the child of a warlock

26:48.712 --> 26:51.178
before my previous child died,

26:51.212 --> 26:55.278
I would remain
powerful and young.

26:57.178 --> 26:59.312
That's why I summoned you

26:59.345 --> 27:02.412
to Santo Domingo.

27:02.445 --> 27:04.845
I felt you...

27:04.878 --> 27:09.012
adrift in the ocean.

27:09.045 --> 27:12.812
So I used my powers
to bring you close.

27:14.345 --> 27:16.245
And I spelled you

27:16.278 --> 27:19.078
so you would fall
in love with me.

27:19.112 --> 27:21.078
I needed you, mi amor,

27:21.112 --> 27:23.345
so that I could live.

27:25.178 --> 27:27.278
Alma wasn't my grandmother.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.345
She was my daughter.

27:29.378 --> 27:32.278
I needed to be pregnant
before she died.

27:32.312 --> 27:35.912
But I didn't make it.

27:35.945 --> 27:38.312
And now that she's dead,

27:38.345 --> 27:40.478
the spell is broken.

27:43.712 --> 27:45.478
KILLIAN:
Freya, please!

27:45.512 --> 27:49.278
Save her! Do something!

27:49.312 --> 27:52.612
(sighs)
Okay.

27:52.645 --> 27:55.512
Okay. Um...

27:55.545 --> 27:59.312
repeat after me, okay?

27:59.345 --> 28:02.745
Vitae eius.

28:02.778 --> 28:06.078
Vitae eius.

28:06.112 --> 28:09.945
BOTH (chanting):
Vitae eius. Vitae eius.

28:09.978 --> 28:13.978
Vitae eius.
Vitae eius.

28:14.012 --> 28:16.478
Vitae eius.

28:16.512 --> 28:18.312
It's not working!

28:18.345 --> 28:19.845
Killian, I'm so sorry.

28:19.878 --> 28:21.678
I don't know what else to do.

28:23.878 --> 28:26.545
I'm sorry, Eva.

28:28.445 --> 28:32.178
EVA: I really did love you, mi
amor.

29:01.345 --> 29:04.145
♪ ♪

29:11.445 --> 29:13.012
(Wendy gasping)

29:16.178 --> 29:18.112
This is Tommy's shirt!

29:18.145 --> 29:20.712
Where the hell is he?!

29:22.178 --> 29:25.478
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch Tarkoff!

29:28.978 --> 29:31.312
Wendy?

29:31.345 --> 29:32.945
Tommy may still be alive.

29:32.978 --> 29:35.312
I'm gonna kill him
either way.

29:36.978 --> 29:38.612
Okay, so we just lost

29:38.645 --> 29:41.845
our opportunity
to take him by surprise.

29:41.878 --> 29:44.512
I think we need to try
a more direct approach.

29:44.545 --> 29:47.645
You're just gonna call him?

29:50.212 --> 29:52.945
TARKOFF: Joanna,
what a pleasant surprise.

29:52.978 --> 29:54.978
Save it.
Frederick told me everything.

29:55.012 --> 29:57.278
Uh, somehow I doubt
he told you everything.

29:57.312 --> 30:00.012
I need to see you. Now.

30:00.045 --> 30:01.445
You know I'm always
happy to see you.

30:01.478 --> 30:02.945
But I'm a little busy
at the moment.

30:02.978 --> 30:04.445
I could kill you easily.

30:04.478 --> 30:06.178
We both know that.

30:06.212 --> 30:09.345
I know your weak spots.
I'm stronger than you.

30:09.378 --> 30:10.978
Are threatening me?

30:11.012 --> 30:12.612
That's adorable.

30:12.645 --> 30:13.678
I don't want to kill you.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.345
I don't do that anymore.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.978
Not unless I have to.

30:17.012 --> 30:18.778
Yeah, finally you're
tempting me, Tarkoff.

30:18.812 --> 30:22.778
Or if you'd like
to negotiate a peace,

30:22.812 --> 30:25.445
you're gonna have
to meet with me.

30:25.478 --> 30:28.112
Neutral ground.

30:28.145 --> 30:31.778
Name the place.

30:31.812 --> 30:33.345
What am I gonna do?

30:33.378 --> 30:35.078
I don't know. We'll...

30:35.112 --> 30:38.645
We'll ask my family what
to do with her remains.

30:38.678 --> 30:40.412
They'll help us figure it out.

30:40.445 --> 30:41.612
I should be angry,

30:41.645 --> 30:43.645
but instead I'm just so...
I know.

30:43.678 --> 30:45.445
It's confusing.

30:45.478 --> 30:47.612
The spell she had
you under was strong.

30:47.645 --> 30:50.145
And it's gonna take some
time for it to wear off.

30:54.012 --> 30:55.178
I'm so sorry.

30:55.212 --> 30:57.745
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

30:57.778 --> 30:59.945
I called you crazy and
the other night at the bar...

30:59.978 --> 31:01.112
It's okay.

31:01.145 --> 31:03.678
It's not your fault.

31:11.778 --> 31:13.778
(cell phone ringing)

31:15.978 --> 31:18.978
I'm sorry. Ingrid?

31:19.012 --> 31:21.612
Freya, I need you to come over
to the library right now!

31:21.645 --> 31:22.778
Are you okay?

31:22.812 --> 31:24.745
No. Just hurry, please!

31:24.778 --> 31:26.312
I just closed up and there's
this scary guy outside

31:26.345 --> 31:27.945
that looks dangerous.

31:27.978 --> 31:30.845
I'm on my way.

31:30.878 --> 31:34.145
TARKOFF (as Ingrid):
I'm really, really scared.

31:48.358 --> 31:49.625
Oh, my God.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.725
Ingrid!

31:50.758 --> 31:52.292
Oh, my God.

31:52.325 --> 31:53.692
Ingrid, are you okay?

31:53.725 --> 31:54.858
What happened?!

31:54.892 --> 31:56.692
Ingrid!

31:57.558 --> 32:03.658
Wake up!

32:03.692 --> 32:05.125
(door locks)

32:05.158 --> 32:07.392
And then she just died

32:07.425 --> 32:09.925
right there in my arms.

32:11.258 --> 32:13.092
I thought I loved her.

32:14.825 --> 32:18.158
I can't even trust
my own mind.

32:18.192 --> 32:19.725
Everything I've been living
the past few weeks,

32:19.758 --> 32:22.725
everything I've been feeling,
has been a lie.

32:22.758 --> 32:25.025
I am so sorry.

32:25.058 --> 32:26.058
I don't know
what's real anymore.

32:26.092 --> 32:27.125
I don't know who
I can trust.

32:27.158 --> 32:28.725
You can trust me.

32:31.725 --> 32:34.492
Thanks.

32:34.525 --> 32:38.358
Y‐Yeah.

32:38.392 --> 32:40.492
Um...

32:40.525 --> 32:41.625
maybe, uh...

32:41.658 --> 32:44.292
because...

32:44.325 --> 32:46.492
you're the only family
I've got...

32:47.758 --> 32:50.925
I need to come clean
about something.

32:52.325 --> 32:56.025
It's something
I'm ashamed of and...

32:56.058 --> 32:58.392
something I'll regret
for the rest of my life,

32:58.425 --> 33:01.225
but I need to
tell you the truth.

33:01.258 --> 33:02.792
About what?

33:02.825 --> 33:04.858
It has to do with

33:04.892 --> 33:07.958
the night of my wedding.

33:07.992 --> 33:10.492
I came to see you...

33:10.525 --> 33:12.058
on the dock.

33:17.925 --> 33:19.592
I don't see him.

33:20.858 --> 33:22.092
There.

33:27.725 --> 33:28.825
Where the hell
is Tommy?

33:28.858 --> 33:30.958
Wendy...
pleasant as ever.

33:30.992 --> 33:32.392
I never liked you‐‐
now I hate you‐‐

33:32.425 --> 33:33.625
so tell me
where he is

33:33.658 --> 33:34.725
before I
kick your ass.

33:34.758 --> 33:36.158
Why can't you be
more like

33:36.192 --> 33:37.492
your sister?

33:37.525 --> 33:38.792
So... lovely...

33:38.825 --> 33:40.025
so elegant?
JOANNA:
Just answer her.

33:40.058 --> 33:41.158
Where's Tommy?

33:41.192 --> 33:42.392
Don't worry, he's alive.

33:42.425 --> 33:43.892
The vessel is safe.

33:43.925 --> 33:45.925
(flames crackling)

33:47.358 --> 33:48.825
Oh... you will?

33:48.858 --> 33:51.458
Well, then I'll kill you
even faster.

33:51.492 --> 33:53.292
You know, I can read your mind.

33:53.325 --> 33:54.458
Pussy cat...

33:54.492 --> 33:55.792
JOANNA:
We're not here
to kill you.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.492
But we can't let you
bring back the king.

33:58.525 --> 33:59.625
It's too late...

33:59.658 --> 34:00.725
it will happen.

34:00.758 --> 34:02.125
You were
on our side once.

34:02.158 --> 34:03.692
(laughs):
No...

34:03.725 --> 34:05.892
I swore an oath...

34:05.925 --> 34:08.258
just like Frederick.

34:09.358 --> 34:11.225
I joined the rebellion
as a spy.

34:11.258 --> 34:13.825
I will serve the king...

34:13.858 --> 34:15.958
to my death.

34:15.992 --> 34:17.458
But I will serve you, too.

34:17.492 --> 34:19.892
I've watched
you, Joanna...

34:19.925 --> 34:21.692
for hundreds of years;
I've watched

34:21.725 --> 34:23.858
and I've read
your mind from afar.

34:25.725 --> 34:27.392
I've known your pain...

34:28.992 --> 34:30.058
your passion

34:30.092 --> 34:32.225
and your secrets.

34:32.258 --> 34:33.458
I know you better

34:33.492 --> 34:34.825
than you could ever imagine.

34:34.858 --> 34:36.292
I've heard so many

34:36.325 --> 34:37.525
of your thoughts.
Yeah?

34:37.558 --> 34:39.158
Can you hear
what I'm thinking now?

34:39.192 --> 34:40.725
Yes, of course.

34:40.758 --> 34:42.525
And it does nothing
to dissuade me.

34:44.058 --> 34:45.958
I still love you.

34:45.992 --> 34:46.992
You're angry now,

34:47.025 --> 34:48.225
but you'll get over it.

34:48.258 --> 34:50.025
I'm very patient...
I've waited...

34:50.058 --> 34:52.725
so long for the day

34:52.758 --> 34:54.725
when you father
would finally return

34:54.758 --> 34:57.125
and I would claim my reward.

34:57.158 --> 34:59.125
The king promised me,

34:59.158 --> 35:00.192
if I helped him,

35:00.225 --> 35:01.692
you would be mine.

35:01.725 --> 35:02.792
I'm not your reward.

35:02.825 --> 35:04.358
You'll come around
in time.

35:05.425 --> 35:07.658
And we will return
to our home...

35:07.692 --> 35:08.958
together.

35:08.992 --> 35:10.292
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.358
JOANNA:
If you really knew me, Tarkoff,

35:12.392 --> 35:13.358
then you would know that

35:13.392 --> 35:14.492
no one can control me.

35:14.525 --> 35:16.058
Least of all you.
I have no wish

35:16.092 --> 35:17.325
to control you,

35:17.358 --> 35:19.658
I just want to
serve you, my love.

35:19.692 --> 35:21.492
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

35:21.525 --> 35:23.358
Expergo!

35:37.358 --> 35:38.892
Okay. Look, I get it.

35:38.925 --> 35:40.692
I get it,
it's a lot to take in.

35:40.725 --> 35:42.658
But can you at least
say something?

35:42.692 --> 35:43.992
You tried to kill me.

35:44.025 --> 35:45.458
Killian, try
to understand:

35:45.492 --> 35:48.325
Freya... had just
left me for you.

35:48.358 --> 35:49.892
I was out of
my mind, man.

35:49.925 --> 35:52.658
I wa... I was so upset
and angry and...

35:52.692 --> 35:54.058
Look, I didn't know
about my powers.

35:54.092 --> 35:55.358
Okay, I‐I didn't know what
I was capable of.

35:55.392 --> 35:57.192
No. No. No.

35:57.225 --> 35:58.658
Attacking me, that's one thing.

35:58.692 --> 36:01.092
But you left me there
on the boat.

36:02.525 --> 36:04.525
Pushed me out to sea
to let me die.

36:04.558 --> 36:06.492
I panicked.

36:07.892 --> 36:11.058
You panicked?
You panicked?!

36:13.758 --> 36:14.892
Don't touch me!

36:15.525 --> 36:16.525
I'm sorry.

36:16.558 --> 36:18.525
I guess I just...

36:18.558 --> 36:20.325
panicked.
I suppose

36:20.358 --> 36:22.058
I had that coming, but
you need to calm down.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.458
Why?

36:23.492 --> 36:24.525
Because we shouldn't fight?

36:24.558 --> 36:26.525
Because we're family?

36:26.558 --> 36:27.992
Because I can trust... you?

36:28.025 --> 36:29.358
You don't want to do this.

36:29.392 --> 36:31.192
Yeah, I do.
I think we both do;

36:31.225 --> 36:32.825
I think we've wanted this
our whole lives.

36:32.858 --> 36:33.958
Since the day I was born

36:33.992 --> 36:35.358
you've wanted me out of the way.

36:35.392 --> 36:37.392
You're wrong.
Really?
Freya didn't even know

36:37.425 --> 36:38.858
you had a brother
till I showed up.

36:38.892 --> 36:39.792
You know, I didn't live up
to the Gardiner name,

36:39.825 --> 36:41.325
so you pretended
I didn't exist.

36:41.358 --> 36:43.058
You didn't want to
be a part of this family!

36:43.092 --> 36:44.158
You ran away!

36:44.192 --> 36:45.292
I only ran away

36:45.325 --> 36:46.825
'cause you pushed me
out the door!

36:51.825 --> 36:53.958
Next time you try to kill me...

36:53.992 --> 36:55.925
(grunts)

36:59.192 --> 37:00.225
...make sure I'm dead.

37:00.258 --> 37:02.125
Gladly.

37:02.158 --> 37:03.658
(grunts)

37:15.025 --> 37:17.158
(grunts)

37:37.825 --> 37:40.592
(grunts)

38:11.158 --> 38:12.425
(screams)

38:23.358 --> 38:25.158
Frederick.

38:25.192 --> 38:27.292
We finally found the vessel.

38:27.325 --> 38:30.192
It's time to prepare
for the king's arrival.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.292
I'm sure your grandfather's
willing to let bygones

38:32.325 --> 38:34.025
be bygones.

38:34.058 --> 38:35.958
You're not still mad,

38:35.992 --> 38:37.358
because I beat the living shit

38:37.392 --> 38:39.158
out of you, are you?

38:42.325 --> 38:43.892
Oh, dear.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.825
Looks like the only way
to beat a telepath

38:48.858 --> 38:50.692
is with the element of surprise.

38:55.425 --> 38:56.992
(grunts)

38:59.925 --> 39:00.992
(groans)

39:01.025 --> 39:03.292
(gagging)

39:03.325 --> 39:05.192
(gurgling, grunts)

39:05.225 --> 39:07.458
I will never...
let you

39:07.492 --> 39:09.158
or my grandfather

39:09.192 --> 39:10.892
hurt my family again.

39:10.925 --> 39:12.325
I will kill the host...

39:13.992 --> 39:16.358
and then I will kill myself.

39:16.392 --> 39:17.525
The king will

39:17.558 --> 39:18.692
never...

39:18.725 --> 39:19.858
come to this world.

39:19.892 --> 39:20.958
Never.

39:20.992 --> 39:22.358
(grunts)

39:22.392 --> 39:23.392
Never.

39:23.425 --> 39:24.458
(trembles, grunts)

39:24.492 --> 39:26.092
(gasps)
(grunts)

39:27.425 --> 39:30.058
(choking)

39:30.092 --> 39:31.892
I left you...

39:31.925 --> 39:33.592
a present...

39:36.025 --> 39:38.658
in the... in the garden.

39:59.325 --> 40:01.758
(debris clinking)

40:27.225 --> 40:28.958
(gasps)
Where's Frederick?

40:28.992 --> 40:30.725
The scorpion venom
must have worn off.

40:30.758 --> 40:33.158
He can't have gone far.
We locked him in.

40:33.192 --> 40:35.592
(door slams)

40:38.358 --> 40:41.292
What happened?

40:41.325 --> 40:44.892
The garden. I'm so sorry.
