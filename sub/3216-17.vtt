Dad's on a hunting trip.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.305

DEAN:
This is Dad's book.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.271

where he left off.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.986
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.628
Come on, man,
is it much further? I'm cold.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.714
Should be just up here.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.679
-Whoa.
-Here we go.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.056
How did you find this place anyway,
Thurston?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.809
CRAIG:
My cousin told me about it.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.981
Oh, I am so not going in there.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.317
Wusses.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.944

might as well check it out.

and get back to the car.

01:11.655 --> 01:14.074
It's freaking cold out here.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.871
Want me to hold your hand?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.711
Are there any other parts I can hold?

01:25.920 --> 01:27.963
Ew. Shut up, you loser.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.381
Well, come on.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.050
BOY 2:
What?

01:44.355 --> 01:45.898
No way.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.692
Look at all this stuff.

01:48.901 --> 01:52.112
Come on. It's this way.

01:58.494 --> 02:01.038
They say that it lives in the root cellar.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.083
Goes after girls. Always girls.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.795
It just strings them up.

02:08.003 --> 02:12.424
"They say"? Who's "they"?
Where did you hear this crap?

02:12.633 --> 02:15.094
-I told you, my cousin.
-And where did she hear it?

02:16.095 --> 02:18.305
CRAIG:
I don't know. She just heard it.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.434
Whatever. Give me that thing.

02:43.289 --> 02:47.459
CRAIG:
Ooh, look, it's the evil root cellar.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.754
No, where Satan cans all his vegetables.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.758
Well, get your candy-asses down here
and see for yourselves.

02:54.967 --> 03:00.306
It's just a basement full of skank-filled
jars in some crap farmhouse.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.267
I don't see anything scary.

Sorry.

Not a lot of scenery here in east Texas.
Kind of gotta make your own.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.767
Man, we're not kids anymore, Dean.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.144
We're not gonna start
that crap up again.

04:29.228 --> 04:30.270
Start what up?

04:30.854 --> 04:33.232
That prank stuff.
It's stupid and it always escalates.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.566
What's the matter, Sammy?

04:34.775 --> 04:38.404
You afraid you're gonna get a little Nair
in your shampoo again, huh?

04:38.779 --> 04:42.574
-All right. Just remember, you started it.
-Bring it on, baldy.

04:43.784 --> 04:47.871
-Where are we, anyway?
-Few hours outside of Richardson.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.124
Give me the lowdown again.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.003
All right, about a month or two ago...

04:54.211 --> 04:56.588
...kids go poking around
this local haunted house.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.384
-Haunted by what?
-Apparently, a pretty misogynistic spirit.

05:00.592 --> 05:05.472
Legend goes, it takes girls
and strings them up in the rafters.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.183
These kids see this dead girl
hanging in the cellar.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.020
-Anybody ID the corpse?
-Well, that's the thing.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.605
By the time the cops got there,
the body was gone.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.899
Cops are saying the kids were
yanking chains.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.443
Maybe the cops are right.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.238
Maybe, but I read a couple of
the kids' firsthand accounts.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.907
-They seem sincere.
-Where did you read these accounts?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.204
I knew we'd be passing through Texas...

05:29.288 --> 05:34.918
...so last night, I surfed some
local paranormal websites.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.546
-And I found one.
-And what's it called?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.302

Let me guess.

05:47.473 --> 05:48.932
-Yeah, probably.
-Yeah.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.392
Most of those websites
wouldn't know...

05:50.476 --> 05:53.103
...a ghost if it bit them
in the "persqueeter."

05:54.646 --> 05:59.276
Look, we let Dad take off,
which was a mistake, by the way.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.861
Now we don't know where he is.

Meantime, we gotta find
something to hunt.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.490
No harm checking this out.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.992
All right,
so where do we find these kids?

06:08.160 --> 06:10.579
Same place you always find kids
in a town like this.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.881
It was the scariest thing I ever saw,
I swear to God.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.967
From the moment we walked in.
The walls were painted black.

06:24.176 --> 06:25.594
-Red.
-I think it was blood.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.098
-All these freaky symbols.
-Crosses and stars, and....

06:29.306 --> 06:30.891
-Pentagons.
-Pentecostals.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.684
Whatever, I had my eyes closed.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.562
I can tell you this much:
No matter what anybody says--

06:35.771 --> 06:37.356
-That poor girl.
-With the black....

06:37.564 --> 06:40.275
-Blonde.
-Red hair, just hanging there.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.402
-Kicking.
-Without even moving.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.613
-She was real.
-It's 100 percent.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.532
And kind of hot.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.994
-Well, you know, in a dead sort of way.
-Okay.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.998
And how did you find out
about this place, anyway?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.625
-Craig.
-Craig took us.

07:15.936 --> 07:20.107
Yeah, I'm a writer too.
I write for my school's lit. magazine.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.192
Well, good for you, Morrissey.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.279
Um, we're doing an article
on local hauntings.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.573
Rumor has it you might know about one.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.577
-You mean the Hell House?
-That's the one.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.371
I didn't think there was
anything to the story.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.206
Why don't you tell us the story.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.962
Well, supposedly, back in the '30s...

07:42.588 --> 07:44.256
...this farmer, Mordechai Murdock,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.050
he used to live in the house
with his six daughters.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.053
It was during the Depression,
his crops were failing...

07:50.262 --> 07:52.598
...he didn't have enough money
to feed his children.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.893
So I guess that's when
he went off the deep end.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.603
How?

07:59.271 --> 08:03.400
Well, he figured it was best if
his girls died quick...

08:03.483 --> 08:06.278
...rather than starve to death.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.405
So he attacked them.

08:09.615 --> 08:12.409
And they screamed,
begged for him to stop...

08:13.577 --> 08:15.996
...but he just strung them up,
one after another.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.000
And then when it was all finished,
he turned around and hung himself.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.546
Now they say that his spirit is
trapped in the house forever...

08:24.630 --> 08:26.882
...stringing up any other girl
that goes inside.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.469
And where did you hear all this?

08:30.552 --> 08:35.015
My cousin Dana told me.
I don't know where she heard it from.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.559
You gotta realize,
I didn't believe this for a second.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.811
But now you do.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.233

what the hell to think, man.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.694
You guys, I'll tell you exactly
what I told the police, okay?

08:47.903 --> 08:52.908
That girl was real, and she was dead.
This was not a prank.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.369
I swear to God, I don't wanna go
anywhere near that house...

08:55.577 --> 08:56.954

09:00.290 --> 09:01.667

-Yeah, so much for curb appeal.

09:31.530 --> 09:34.533
-Yeah, but the EMF's no good.
-Why?

09:34.616 --> 09:38.787
I think that thing's still got a little juice
in it. It's screwing with all the readings.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.082
-Yeah, that would do it.
-Yeah.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.304
...and bring it back, or....

14:47.929 --> 14:49.472
Or you can make out with me.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.475
I'll take the homicidal ghost, thanks.

-Hell, no.

What happened?

17:48.860 --> 17:51.237
Cops say that poor girl
hung herself in the house.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.490
-Suicide?
-Yeah.

17:53.698 --> 17:57.076
And she was a straight-A student
with a full ride to UT too.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.454

What do you think?

18:08.713 --> 18:10.465
I think maybe we missed something.

-Come on.

-Stop.

Hey.

It's killing me.

take a swig of this.

-Maybe we should just go.
-No.

No, we've lost the cops.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.831
This whole damn job's bugging me.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.334
I thought the legend said that
Mordechai only goes after chicks.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.627
-It does.
-All right.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.255
That explains why he went after you.
But why me?

22:19.756 --> 22:21.716
Hilarious.

22:22.175 --> 22:25.053
Legend also says he hung himself.
But you see those slit wrists?

22:25.261 --> 22:27.472
-Yeah.
-What's up with that?

22:27.722 --> 22:28.848
And the ax too?

22:29.098 --> 22:31.059
Ghosts are usually pretty strict, right?

22:31.267 --> 22:33.186
Following the same patterns
over and over.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.480
-But this mook keeps changing.
-Exactly.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.983
I'm telling you,
the way the story goes....

22:40.151 --> 22:41.569
Wait a minute.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.237
What?

22:43.613 --> 22:46.657
Someone added a new posting
to the Hellhound site. Listen to this:

22:46.866 --> 22:49.368
"They say Mordechai Murdock
was really a Satanist...

22:49.577 --> 22:53.039
...who chopped up his victims with an ax
before slitting his own wrists.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.292
Now he's imprisoned
in the house for eternity."

22:56.793 --> 22:58.586
Where the hell is this going?

23:00.671 --> 23:04.467
I don't know. But I think I might have
just figured out where it all started.

Hey, Craig.

Guys, look, I'm really not in the mood
to answer any more of your questions.

23:35.039 --> 23:38.543
Oh, don't worry. Don't worry. We're just
here to buy an album, that's all.

23:45.675 --> 23:48.010
You know, I couldn't figure out
what that symbol was.

23:48.219 --> 23:51.722
And then I realized
it doesn't mean anything.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.808
It's the logo for Blue Öyster Cult.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.937
Tell me, Craig. You into BÖC?

23:59.355 --> 24:01.232
Or just scaring the hell out of people?

about that house.

24:14.579 --> 24:15.955
All right.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.626
My cousin Dana was on break from TCU.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.880
I guess we were just bored,
looking for something to do.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.757
So I showed her
this abandoned dump I found.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.845
We thought it'd be funny
if we made it look like it was haunted.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.763
So we painted symbols on the walls.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.849
Some from some albums.

24:35.391 --> 24:38.603
Some from some of Dana's
theology textbooks.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.772
Then we found out this guy,
Murdock, used to live there...

24:43.316 --> 24:45.693
...so we made up some story
to go along with that.

24:45.902 --> 24:49.530
So they told people
who told other people.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.659
And then these two guys
put it on their stupid website.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.748
...took on a life of its own.

funny at first, but....

-Yeah, a Tibetan Thought-form.

26:30.923 --> 26:35.052
Okay, so there was this incident
in Tibet in 1915.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.680
Group of monks visualize
a golem in their heads.

they bring the thing to life.

web surfers could do.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.068

the story about Mordechai...

26:51.277 --> 26:52.778
...then it spreads, goes online.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.281
Now countless people
believe in the bastard.

26:55.489 --> 26:56.949
Wait. You're trying to tell me...

26:57.158 --> 27:00.786
...that just because people
believe in Mordechai, he's real?

27:01.620 --> 27:03.080
I don't know. Maybe.

27:04.081 --> 27:07.626
People believe in Santa Claus. How come
I'm not hooked up every Christmas?

27:07.877 --> 27:10.880
Because you're a bad person.
And because of this:

That's a Tibetan spirit sigil.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.513

from a textbook.

27:19.722 --> 27:22.016
I bet they painted this
not even knowing what it was.

...staring at the symbol,
thinking about Mordechai....

27:32.943 --> 27:36.405
I mean, I don't know, but it might be
enough to bring a tulpa to life.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.532
It would explain why he keeps changing.

27:38.741 --> 27:41.744
Right. As the legend changes,
people think different things...

27:41.952 --> 27:43.329
...so Mordechai himself changes.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.997
Like a game of Telephone.

27:45.206 --> 27:47.249
Would also explain
why rock salt didn't work.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.752
Because he's not
a traditional spirit, per se.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.545
-Yeah.
-Okay. So why don't we just...

27:51.754 --> 27:54.590
...get this spirit-sigil thingy
off the wall and the website.

27:54.799 --> 27:55.966
Well, it's not that simple.

27:56.050 --> 27:59.678
You see, once tulpas are created,
they take on a life of their own.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.558

so if he really is a Thought-form...

28:04.767 --> 28:07.019

-Look, guys...

30:01.675 --> 30:03.969
...we all know what we saw.
What's in the house.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.763
Thanks to your website...

30:06.013 --> 30:08.057
...there are thousands
of people hearing about Mordechai.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.893
Means people are gonna keep
showing up at Hell House...

30:11.101 --> 30:12.895
...running into him, could get hurt.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.396
-Yeah.
-Maybe he's got a point.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.065
-No.
-No.

30:16.273 --> 30:19.318
Okay, we have an obligation
to our fans, to the truth.

just forget it, all right? These guys....

30:25.950 --> 30:27.201
You could bitch-slap them.

30:27.409 --> 30:30.079
I could probably even tell them
that thing about Mordechai.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.083
But they're still not gonna help us.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.001
SAM: Let's just go.
-Yeah, you're right.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.128
-What'd you say about...?
-No. Wait.

30:38.212 --> 30:39.964
-Wait, wait.
-Hold on a second here.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.966
What thing about Mordechai,
you guys?

30:42.174 --> 30:44.969
-Don't tell them.
-If they agree to shut the website down....

30:45.177 --> 30:46.428
They're not. Said so yourself.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.723
No, wait, wait.
Don't listen to him, okay? We'll do it.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.726

We'll do it.

30:52.935 --> 30:54.562
It's a secret, Sam.

30:55.104 --> 30:58.190
Look, it is a pretty big deal.
And it wasn't easy to dig up.

30:58.399 --> 31:01.110

you'll shut everything down.

It's a death certificate from the '30s.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.454
We got it at the library.

31:12.705 --> 31:13.956
SAM:
According to the coroner...

31:14.164 --> 31:17.418
...the actual cause of death
was a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.044
He didn't hang or cut himself.

31:19.128 --> 31:22.965
-He shot himself?
SAM: Yep. With a .45 pistol.

31:23.173 --> 31:26.343
-They say he's terrified of them.
-If you shoot him with a .45...

31:26.552 --> 31:29.054
...loaded with
these special wrought-iron rounds...

31:29.555 --> 31:31.557
...you'd kill the son of a bitch.

Harry. Slow your roll, buddy.

You know, you're way too tense.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.800
They post it yet?

32:11.138 --> 32:13.015
"We've learned from reputable sources...

32:13.223 --> 32:15.768
...that Mordechai Murdock
has a fatal fear of firearms."

32:16.185 --> 32:18.187
All right. How long do we wait?

32:19.605 --> 32:23.150
Long enough for the new story to spread
and the legend to change.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.403
I figure by nightfall,
iron rounds will work on the sucker.

Mordechai can't leave the house,
we can't kill him....

We improvise.

That's your solution?

to the ground?

No one will go in anymore.

I mean, Mordechai can't haunt a house
if there's no house to haunt.

It's fast and dirty, but it works.

What if the legend changes
and Mordechai is allowed to leave?

-No, smart-ass.

He read all about the Hell House
on our website...

38:09.496 --> 38:12.416
...and wants to option
the motion-picture rights.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.918
Maybe even have us write it.
