00:00.001 --> 00:02.255
There's a traitor amongst
us. A Catholic spy.

00:02.257 --> 00:03.348
My husband has died.

00:03.350 --> 00:05.466
It seems as though my
head has been cut off.

00:05.468 --> 00:07.673
I shall wear black.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.073
Christopher suggested
that Samuel was killed.

00:10.075 --> 00:12.033
This is the trait of a spy.

00:12.035 --> 00:14.473
You gave tender comfort to Mr Sharrow.

00:14.475 --> 00:16.913
To give comfort to any woman might need it.

00:16.915 --> 00:20.233
Did we not search the faraway
mountains together for your brother

00:20.235 --> 00:21.753
when he was lost?

00:21.755 --> 00:23.833
I would never act as informer.

00:23.835 --> 00:25.953
You promised you would help us.

00:25.955 --> 00:28.353
I want to repay you, Chacrow, I promise.

00:28.355 --> 00:32.875
I heard you speaking with that
natural. Tell me the truth.

00:33.995 --> 00:36.433
Alice!

00:36.435 --> 00:40.913
Your children will surely have
been taken. That life is gone.

00:40.915 --> 00:44.313
This Virginia will be kind
to us. I will be beside you.

00:44.315 --> 00:47.793
- You will see.
- That Pedro taken a liking to you?

00:47.795 --> 00:50.633
Maria? Maria had children of her own.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.353
She was taken from them.

00:53.355 --> 00:55.475
Give the child back, Maria.

03:12.115 --> 03:14.115
Just leave us alone.

03:16.475 --> 03:19.953
How many ways have we helped you?

03:19.955 --> 03:23.913
I gave my trust and love to Silas.

03:23.915 --> 03:27.593
Silas Sharrow has left me in shame.

03:27.595 --> 03:31.673
Tell me, how will I win the
respect of my people back?

03:31.675 --> 03:33.993
Why do you ask me?

03:33.995 --> 03:35.993
If Silas will not give me what I ask

03:35.995 --> 03:39.033
in order to answer the
efforts Opechancanough made

03:39.035 --> 03:40.793
on his behalf in the mountains,

03:40.795 --> 03:44.513
then he brings humiliation upon them.

03:44.515 --> 03:48.435
I must have my honour back.

04:05.235 --> 04:08.313
As you predicted, Governor,
Dr Priestly did name a suspect

04:08.315 --> 04:11.313
he considers a Spanish
spy, Secretary Farlow,

04:11.315 --> 04:14.673
a man so riddled with debts, he
might be bought by the first bidder.

04:14.675 --> 04:17.793
You so vehemently wish it to
be the Secretary, do you not?

04:17.795 --> 04:21.033
The same man has so hastily
boarded a ship to Bermuda

04:21.035 --> 04:22.553
as if he's run away.

04:22.555 --> 04:27.033
I have good reason to want you to
keep your attentions on the Doctor.

04:27.035 --> 04:29.753
Have you encouraged him to pursue you?

04:29.755 --> 04:33.433
I believe Christopher wants to marry
me once sufficient time has elapsed.

04:33.435 --> 04:36.833
Let him enjoy your fullest
attentions and affections

04:36.835 --> 04:40.113
so that no man exists in your eyes but he.

04:40.115 --> 04:44.113
The Sharrows have picked
a hot day for hard work.

04:44.115 --> 04:47.033
They tan their hides with animal brains.

04:47.035 --> 04:49.833
It makes for exceptionally soft pelts.

04:49.835 --> 04:53.873
The Sharrows have never been
shy of advancement, have they?

04:53.875 --> 04:57.593
They profit by their
alliance with the naturals.

04:57.595 --> 05:01.715
It's a wonder that you
let them, Governor?

05:05.875 --> 05:08.393
Isn't it pleasing that
the brothers trade well?

05:08.395 --> 05:10.673
Pleasing for their own pockets, yes.

05:10.675 --> 05:13.913
Then you must show
Massinger that you are master

05:13.915 --> 05:16.913
by taking a share of the Sharrows' profits.

05:16.915 --> 05:19.593
If a licence were
required for any Englishman

05:19.595 --> 05:23.873
to conduct trade with the natives,
a warrant granted by our governor...

05:23.875 --> 05:26.473
At a fine cost.

05:26.475 --> 05:29.313
I thought you were
friends with the Sharrows.

05:29.315 --> 05:31.033
I am, to Alice,

05:31.035 --> 05:35.473
but today I am a widow in need
of position here in Jamestown,

05:35.475 --> 05:37.353
and your favour is the merit

05:37.355 --> 05:40.193
by which everything I require is gained.

05:40.195 --> 05:43.155
If our governor required his own counsel...

05:46.235 --> 05:48.353
You may be my counsellor, Widow Castell,

05:48.355 --> 05:50.955
and the world need never know it.

05:52.235 --> 05:54.235
A licence, why?

05:55.795 --> 05:59.513
So that they may rob us of our profits.

05:59.515 --> 06:03.753
You think my ambition so small, Henry? No.

06:03.755 --> 06:06.553
The trades of hides and furs
is a worthwhile enterprise

06:06.555 --> 06:09.713
only while the natives occupy
the land where beasts are caught.

06:09.715 --> 06:11.633
Are you saying it is our intention

06:11.635 --> 06:14.273
to sweep the Pamunkey
from their territories?

06:14.275 --> 06:17.273
The ships keep coming,
bringing many who seek to farm.

06:17.275 --> 06:18.913
We must expand.

06:18.915 --> 06:20.913
But we made a promise to the Pamunkey

06:20.915 --> 06:23.473
that we would honour
the boundaries we agreed.

06:23.475 --> 06:27.315
We lie every day. That's what we do.

06:30.195 --> 06:32.593
When Englishmen first came here,

06:32.595 --> 06:35.713
they gorged themselves
with no thought of tomorrow

06:35.715 --> 06:38.473
or next week or next year.

06:38.475 --> 06:41.033
They expected their needs to be provided,

06:41.035 --> 06:43.993
they wallowed in England's plenty.

06:43.995 --> 06:47.353
Military men had us battle the
natives that we might subdue them,

06:47.355 --> 06:49.313
but when the food was gone

06:49.315 --> 06:51.673
and winter came and there was no shelters,

06:51.675 --> 06:54.233
it was farm labourers, cowhands, carpenters

06:54.235 --> 06:56.193
who begged the Pamunkey to feed us.

06:56.195 --> 06:59.713
They gave us corn, showed
us how to make medicines.

06:59.715 --> 07:02.715
And yet who is our loyalty to...

07:06.355 --> 07:09.435
the heathens who sit on the land we need

07:09.555 --> 07:13.195
or Englishmen who come
here to create a new world?

07:21.915 --> 07:24.673
I require every burgess present

07:24.675 --> 07:29.635
to make an oath that what
is spoken here remains here.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.595
Silas Sharrow.

08:07.355 --> 08:09.513
Yesterday, you laughed once.

08:09.515 --> 08:12.273
Today, you laughed twice.

08:12.275 --> 08:14.835
In one year, you will love me.

08:36.235 --> 08:38.832
You have a skip back in your step, Mercy.

08:38.835 --> 08:42.232
That's because God did not
make sorrow like a rock,

08:42.235 --> 08:46.513
he made it like rain... the sky
goes black, it pours upon us,

08:46.515 --> 08:48.475
then it passes.

08:50.755 --> 08:54.633
James Read will likely be at church,
giving thanks for his happiness.

08:54.635 --> 08:58.233
- Why is that?
- He's to have a wife come here, ma'am.

08:58.235 --> 09:00.755
Corinna, that's her name.

09:02.435 --> 09:04.273
Is that so?

09:34.235 --> 09:39.235
The blacksmith has his eyes
fastened upon you like a moping dog.

09:42.155 --> 09:47.353
Take your peasant smell and your
grisly stare away from me, sir.

09:47.355 --> 09:50.113
- I meant no offence, ma'am.
- Save your crooked manners.

09:50.115 --> 09:54.075
I'd rather not suffer
your sweatstained breath.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.313
Is there anything more suffocatingly ugly

09:59.315 --> 10:01.273
than the envy of a lowly drudge?

10:01.275 --> 10:05.593
I ain't never seen Mistress Castell
speak down to James Read like that.

10:05.595 --> 10:08.833
- Why's she taking against him?
- I thought she like the blacksmith.

10:08.835 --> 10:10.953
She do seem to seek him out every day,

10:10.955 --> 10:14.515
she do seem disappointed
when he ain't there.

10:19.395 --> 10:22.275
Might I hold the babe?

10:30.035 --> 10:32.035
Ssh, ssh, ssh!

10:36.315 --> 10:39.275
Aye, the babe died, one week old.

10:41.715 --> 10:46.715
The mother passed three days
before. I knew it wouldn't survive.

10:49.795 --> 10:51.795
I've met discord plenty.

10:53.995 --> 10:56.995
That tiny child brought me to my knees.

11:02.795 --> 11:06.473
See, this world only pretends to be kind.

11:06.475 --> 11:09.235
That's the trick it plays upon us...

11:11.475 --> 11:13.475
if we let it.

11:27.235 --> 11:28.715
Gout.

11:30.435 --> 11:33.715
Hippocrates called it
the unwalkable disease.

11:35.235 --> 11:38.873
I can't so much as rest
my food on the ground, sir!

11:38.875 --> 11:44.033
I've never known a woman to have
it, only men, usually drinking men.

11:44.035 --> 11:46.073
You're mistaken there, sir,

11:46.075 --> 11:49.713
for I find, should I drink great
amounts, the suffering goes.

11:49.715 --> 11:55.915
So the ale and the mead, Doctor,
are the cure, not the cause.

11:58.635 --> 12:02.075
I see the sorrow in your face, sir, yeah.

12:03.195 --> 12:08.113
You must miss your dear
companion, Recorder Castell.

12:08.115 --> 12:09.753
A sorry loss.

12:09.755 --> 12:11.715
A sorry loss indeed.

12:14.795 --> 12:19.113
It's a mystery as to why he was
on that river at such an hour.

12:19.115 --> 12:23.435
Mysteries are only mysteries
to them that are ignorant.

12:25.795 --> 12:30.075
Am I to take it that you
are not blind in this matter?

12:32.195 --> 12:34.353
I can say nothing.

12:34.355 --> 12:37.193
The inflammation will grow worse.

12:37.195 --> 12:41.275
It will turn raw so that
you cannot leave your bed.

12:46.315 --> 12:50.113
If you promise not to
utter nor mutter a word,

12:50.115 --> 12:52.795
I might confide in what I witnessed.

12:54.795 --> 12:56.835
Make a tea of cherry leaves...

12:57.835 --> 12:59.795
and add this.

13:00.795 --> 13:05.795
- Tea, sir?
- Tell me what you know... Meredith.

14:37.555 --> 14:39.385
No!

14:40.248 --> 14:45.233
'And all the days of
Methuselah were 960 and 9 years,

14:45.235 --> 14:47.113
and he died.

14:47.115 --> 14:51.633
And Lamech lived an 180 and 2 years

14:51.635 --> 14:57.273
and begat a son, and he
called his name Noah, saying,

14:57.275 --> 15:00.273
"This Noah shall comfort
us concerning our work

15:00.275 --> 15:04.473
and toil of our hands because of the
ground which the Lord hath cursed."'

15:04.475 --> 15:09.793
Noah was a true hero of the
Bible. His faith in God let him...

15:09.795 --> 15:11.795
Pedro was a hero.

15:14.475 --> 15:18.473
Tell the Mistress the
tales you told to me, Pedro.

15:18.475 --> 15:21.515
Yes. Tell us, Pedro.

15:23.355 --> 15:29.153
We Kongos had civil wars many times,

15:29.155 --> 15:31.273
from when I was a boy.

15:31.275 --> 15:33.313
Such battles.

15:33.315 --> 15:38.433
Ndongos fired poisoned arrows
at us. They carried such axes!

15:38.435 --> 15:41.033
We used swords and shields.

15:41.035 --> 15:42.995
I was proud to fight...

15:45.035 --> 15:48.595
until the day my
father's head was cut off.

15:50.315 --> 15:52.673
But I fought on.

15:52.675 --> 15:55.435
I was called Pedro Vemba then.

15:56.955 --> 15:59.555
I showed the world my bravery.

16:02.955 --> 16:06.553
I notice that, when Maria
speaks, she continues to work.

16:06.555 --> 16:10.195
When you speak, Pedro,
you forego your labours.

16:11.235 --> 16:13.995
But you were baptised, Pedro.

16:15.035 --> 16:20.313
Yes, he burned all of his
idols, didn't you, noble Pedro?

16:20.315 --> 16:22.993
When my ancestors became Christians,

16:22.995 --> 16:25.313
they did not have to throw out their idols.

16:25.315 --> 16:29.795
A man must love his ancestors,
even when he is a Christian.

16:33.315 --> 16:35.553
Silas!

16:35.555 --> 16:37.835
Silas, Silas!

16:39.075 --> 16:41.075
- Silas!
- Alice!

16:42.955 --> 16:45.953
I fell asleep on the ground in the field.

16:45.955 --> 16:47.553
So I...

16:47.555 --> 16:49.553
- Where's the baby?
- He's gone!

16:49.555 --> 16:52.313
Chacrow was here, in the
woods. He threatened me.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.073
I didn't realise that's what
he was doing at the time.

16:55.075 --> 16:59.553
He warned me, and I fell asleep,
and I'm sorry I fell asleep!

16:59.555 --> 17:02.553
- Chacrow took the baby?
- Yeah!

17:07.515 --> 17:11.555
If he took the babe to adopt him,
then we must bargain with him.

17:13.474 --> 17:17.272
If it was done as an insult, to
provoke us, then we must fight.

17:17.275 --> 17:20.353
Chacrow helped me search for you.

17:20.355 --> 17:24.992
Opechancanough believes that
I owe the Pamunkey a debt.

17:24.994 --> 17:28.915
They want me to serve as a spy
in Jamestown, but I refused.

17:31.595 --> 17:33.715
I'm coming with you, Silas.

17:35.595 --> 17:37.953
I ain't going to let you leave me behind.

17:37.955 --> 17:41.193
I ain't a boy no more! I'm a Sharrow.

17:41.195 --> 17:43.993
I want to play my part and fight.

17:43.995 --> 17:46.315
I ain't letting you tell me no.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.913
You ain't ready, boy!

17:56.915 --> 18:00.073
We need you to look after Alice, Pepper.

18:00.075 --> 18:02.875
I am ready! I ain't a boy!

18:45.795 --> 18:47.835
Have you a remedy for waking?

18:49.555 --> 18:53.713
Can't sleep. My eyes close but
they might just as well be open.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.675
Camomile and lavender.

19:00.635 --> 19:04.193
Do you believe, sir, that the
Spanish might seek to invade us?

19:04.195 --> 19:08.753
Our great mistake, Doctor, is that
we wait for them to come at us.

19:08.755 --> 19:12.833
I've written to the Company nine
times asking them to implore the King

19:12.835 --> 19:14.673
that we use Jamestown as a naval base

19:14.675 --> 19:18.713
where we send a fleet to
conquer the Spanish in Havana.

19:18.715 --> 19:22.033
Does the Governor share your design?

19:22.035 --> 19:28.353
Find me an Englishman in authority
whose courage is not made of taffeta.

19:28.355 --> 19:32.433
But the day will come,
the day will surely come.

19:32.435 --> 19:35.195
Well, I wish you fathoms of sleep, Marshal.

19:41.675 --> 19:45.313
Maria, I followed you last night,

19:45.315 --> 19:48.713
but I lost sight of you.

19:48.715 --> 19:50.675
Where did you go?

19:52.315 --> 19:55.953
The Governor, he actually
told you to watch me?

19:55.955 --> 19:57.873
What is in the woods, Maria?

19:57.875 --> 20:02.953
Or was it Lady Temperance?
She instructs you well.

20:02.955 --> 20:06.595
I hope you do not put
yourself in danger, Maria.

20:11.915 --> 20:13.473
Silas!

20:13.475 --> 20:16.793
Slow down, you'll spend yourself.

20:19.075 --> 20:21.755
It's the man who arrives who matters.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.593
Rage ain't what we need on our side today,

20:25.595 --> 20:28.075
a true mind will serve us better.

20:39.235 --> 20:41.235
I just don't understand.

20:42.435 --> 20:46.593
I don't understand why they
would take your baby, Alice.

20:46.595 --> 20:47.849
They want peace.

20:47.851 --> 20:51.073
The Sharrows are the best
of allies to the Pamunkey.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.873
I can't tell you.

20:52.875 --> 20:57.433
Why not, Alice? I can see it
in your face, there is a reason.

20:57.435 --> 20:59.633
We've done nothing wrong, I promise you.

20:59.635 --> 21:02.353
When the Governor learns
of this, there'll be war.

21:02.355 --> 21:06.713
No, the Governor cannot be told
of this, you must promise me.

21:06.715 --> 21:09.113
Silas will find him, bring him back.

21:09.115 --> 21:12.033
Something is wrong, Alice.

21:12.035 --> 21:13.993
Something is terribly wrong

21:13.995 --> 21:17.113
if you want to keep hidden
that your child has been stolen.

21:17.115 --> 21:19.753
If he ain't found soon,
the babe will starve.

21:19.755 --> 21:21.793
Mercy! Don't say such things.

21:21.795 --> 21:24.833
I've never been so angry at God.

21:24.835 --> 21:29.873
Ain't Alice Sharrow been a good,
churchgoing, Godloving blessing

21:29.875 --> 21:32.555
to every soul that lives here?

21:34.835 --> 21:38.075
I ain't never been so boiling!

21:42.395 --> 21:44.833
Mercy!

21:44.835 --> 21:47.713
What you doing?

21:47.715 --> 21:51.035
She's throwing stones at God.

22:09.315 --> 22:14.075
You... You believe that he's
your child, don't you, Henry?

22:19.915 --> 22:21.915
Do you believe it, Silas?

22:25.435 --> 22:27.875
This will always be between us.

22:37.475 --> 22:40.875
We're here to bring
Alice's boy back to her.

22:42.395 --> 22:45.595
Let that be our only business here today.

22:59.555 --> 23:02.275
Won't you eat just a little, Alice?

23:08.755 --> 23:10.433
Alice, quickly!

23:10.435 --> 23:11.875
Quickly!

24:07.235 --> 24:09.475
Would you do this to a mother?

24:10.515 --> 24:13.193
What kind of monster are you?

24:13.195 --> 24:15.153
I want to speak with Silas.

24:15.155 --> 24:17.233
Tell me where my baby is!

24:17.235 --> 24:19.353
You will be killed for this.

24:19.355 --> 24:23.273
You believe I took the child?

24:23.275 --> 24:29.035
Tell us! Tell us where he is or
I will blow your legs off you.

24:31.995 --> 24:34.915
I did not take your baby.

24:48.755 --> 24:52.875
Mercy, it's true. I believe
him, he didn't take him.

24:57.635 --> 25:00.273
Lordy.

25:00.275 --> 25:01.755
Maria.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.743
Maria!

25:09.745 --> 25:12.212
Maria, have mercy!

25:17.945 --> 25:19.823
Maria?

25:19.825 --> 25:22.983
Please. I'm here to beg you.

25:22.985 --> 25:27.303
- Give me back my baby.
- We know how you have suffered, Maria.

25:27.305 --> 25:30.583
- What is this business?
- Alice's baby has been stolen.

25:30.585 --> 25:34.265
They believe Servant
Maria has taken the child.

25:40.985 --> 25:43.665
I am a mother who lost her children.

25:45.065 --> 25:49.985
I would not cut the heart of any
woman the way my heart has been cut.

25:53.545 --> 25:55.625
I will swear on your Bible.

25:58.505 --> 26:03.183
If I lie to you, may every
spirit I worship curse me,

26:03.185 --> 26:07.025
let my own children never know peace.

26:11.305 --> 26:14.183
I'll wager this is Pamunkey doing.

26:14.185 --> 26:19.223
If Opechancanough seeks to provoke
me, he will taste vengeance.

26:19.225 --> 26:20.903
I will assemble a militia.

26:20.905 --> 26:23.583
Sir! I am a warrior.

26:23.585 --> 26:26.143
You want to serve as a militiaman, Pedro?

26:26.145 --> 26:30.145
You will be proud of me. I
want to serve our governor.

26:56.945 --> 26:59.023
We wait till it's dark,

26:59.025 --> 27:02.385
then we go in there and
we take the boy back.

27:05.345 --> 27:07.663
Are we all true patriots here?

27:09.585 --> 27:13.823
If the naturals have taken
that child to discourage us,

27:13.825 --> 27:15.823
then they will learn that

27:15.825 --> 27:20.263
when God puts a musket into
the hands of a man of Albion,

27:20.265 --> 27:21.903
he makes a mighty foe!

27:29.225 --> 27:30.863
I would march with them

27:30.865 --> 27:34.503
but my foot's got a fire in
it like the devil's own teeth.

27:34.505 --> 27:37.023
I have dreamed of a day such as this.

27:37.025 --> 27:39.303
The Pamunkey have given us a perfect reason

27:39.305 --> 27:41.465
to bring a war down upon them.

27:44.265 --> 27:47.583
Governor, are we to take the negro with us?

27:47.585 --> 27:50.745
Pedro is a warrior, let him play his part.

28:22.545 --> 28:26.265
- Where is Alice?
- She's inside, resting on my bed.

28:27.665 --> 28:30.063
I witnessed her.

28:30.065 --> 28:33.463
She wandered away and left
her baby outside at the tavern.

28:33.465 --> 28:36.223
James Read had to pick it up and wake Alice

28:36.225 --> 28:39.185
from what looked like a walking dream.

28:41.185 --> 28:44.543
She may have done the
same thing in the woods

28:44.545 --> 28:46.505
with no one to see her.

28:48.025 --> 28:49.825
Will you speak with her?

28:52.825 --> 28:54.825
Will you ask her?

28:59.865 --> 29:01.865
I will ask her.

29:04.385 --> 29:08.663
If it were dirt or infection was the cause,

29:08.665 --> 29:11.345
it would likely affect one eye only.

29:14.505 --> 29:16.265
Lie back, if you would, sir.

29:22.225 --> 29:27.023
I've heard tell of men, Master
Massinger, made blind with rage.

29:27.025 --> 29:30.023
My collar, Doctor, will
see all the men eyeless

29:30.025 --> 29:31.743
before it sees me.

29:31.745 --> 29:33.743
I take it you mean the Governor.

29:33.745 --> 29:35.545
A man ruled by avarice.

29:36.825 --> 29:40.143
He is a most devoted servant of the colony.

29:40.145 --> 29:43.703
Strip away that man's
buff coat and his shirt

29:43.705 --> 29:48.703
and his skin will not reveal any
loyalty to God or to King James

29:48.705 --> 29:52.543
or to England, just an
allegiance to himself.

29:52.545 --> 29:54.903
If the politicians have no patriotism...

29:54.905 --> 29:56.865
Then why might any man?

30:51.785 --> 30:53.623
Is there a reason, James Read,

30:53.625 --> 30:58.623
that you did not march with the men
tonight to win back a stolen child?

30:58.625 --> 31:01.383
When a man sets off with
a musket in his hand,

31:01.385 --> 31:05.105
he don't prefer to come
home unless he's used it.

31:06.145 --> 31:07.823
If the natives took the babe,

31:07.825 --> 31:10.783
then the Sharrows are the
best chosen to reclaim it.

31:10.785 --> 31:14.663
Perhaps you do not believe that
the Pamunkey have the infant.

31:14.665 --> 31:20.425
You witnessed Alice Sharrow leave her
babe outside the tavern, oblivious.

31:21.745 --> 31:24.583
Now that child has vanished.

31:24.585 --> 31:26.703
You think she lost it?

31:26.705 --> 31:29.503
I'm asking you to confirm what you saw.

31:29.505 --> 31:34.463
I know this... if Alice made such
a terrible mistake, she'd admit it.

31:34.465 --> 31:37.185
She might, if her mind were her own.

31:38.225 --> 31:39.705
No.

31:41.865 --> 31:43.865
The babe was taken.

31:45.785 --> 31:49.783
She's perfect to you in
every regard, isn't she?

31:49.785 --> 31:53.343
It must torment you
that you cannot have her.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.143
When a human soul is diseased,

31:55.145 --> 31:57.783
it sees the whole world
in the same darkness.

31:57.785 --> 32:00.183
You do not know my heart, James Read.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.623
I will not be condemned by any man,

32:02.625 --> 32:06.143
not for one more day of
my life, do you understand?

32:06.145 --> 32:09.985
I want the child to be
found. That is what matters.

32:11.825 --> 32:15.185
You will tell me that you appreciate that.

32:16.545 --> 32:18.665
I appreciate that, ma'am.

32:30.345 --> 32:34.023
I cannot tell you how much it
pains me to ask you this, Alice,

32:34.025 --> 32:35.823
but I must.

32:35.825 --> 32:39.663
I ain't never loved a living
soul the way I love you,

32:39.665 --> 32:43.143
not my ma, not my sisters...

32:43.145 --> 32:45.265
not my husband.

32:49.185 --> 32:50.665
Alice...

32:54.185 --> 32:55.863
is it...

32:55.865 --> 33:00.383
Is it possible that you
left your babe somewhere,

33:00.385 --> 33:02.625
that you just forgot about him?

33:04.905 --> 33:09.825
I've tormented myself with that
same question a thousand times.

33:12.305 --> 33:15.985
Verity, I promise you,
little Silas was taken.

33:27.625 --> 33:30.223
And I thought the greatest
pain a woman might know

33:30.225 --> 33:32.865
was to never bear a child of her own.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.305
I was wrong.

34:13.784 --> 34:17.103
We thank you gentlemen
for coming all this way,

34:17.105 --> 34:18.783
but this is Sharrow business.

34:18.784 --> 34:23.342
Relations with the heathens,
Henry, are Jamestown business.

34:23.344 --> 34:25.543
I will not let you use my child

34:25.545 --> 34:28.623
as a reason to go to war with the Pamunkey.

34:28.625 --> 34:32.463
I make no secret of my belief that
we'll never enjoy supremacy here

34:32.465 --> 34:34.862
till the savages know they're conquered,

34:34.864 --> 34:39.505
but I will give my life today
to preserve the breath of a babe.

34:42.784 --> 34:45.703
We've been watching the village.

34:45.705 --> 34:48.663
We don't know if the child is in there.

34:48.665 --> 34:50.625
Hup, hup!

34:59.425 --> 35:03.465
It seems they are well enough
aware that we have arrived.

35:07.585 --> 35:09.983
We hope you can assist us, Opechancanough,

35:09.985 --> 35:13.943
to find the child that was taken.

35:16.305 --> 35:19.945
I cannot control every
man from every village.

35:22.825 --> 35:24.465
I am only a king.

35:29.745 --> 35:32.863
If I can discover news for you
of where the child might be,

35:32.865 --> 35:34.783
what will you give to us?

35:34.785 --> 35:37.465
We know the King loves English goods.

35:44.305 --> 35:47.265
We wish for knowledge of the English.

35:49.985 --> 35:51.863
How many more will come?

35:51.865 --> 35:54.465
I promise you, we do not know this.

36:01.465 --> 36:04.225
We know many English promises...

36:09.105 --> 36:11.663
but they vanish like smoke.

36:11.665 --> 36:16.145
We are here to reclaim a child,
and this is how you treat us?

36:20.985 --> 36:24.625
Our people go among the
English never to return.

36:31.145 --> 36:35.783
You stole Pocahontas from us and
her child remains beyond the sea.

36:35.785 --> 36:41.305
This is not peace, this is not kindness.

36:43.785 --> 36:48.703
Do you see my face,
Opechancanough? I will take counsel.

36:48.705 --> 36:51.703
I will speak with the Sharrows,

36:51.705 --> 36:57.603
and if that child is not returned,
then we will be back, ready to fight.

37:04.710 --> 37:06.348
Christopher.

37:06.350 --> 37:10.908
Jocelyn. I promised I would seek
the truth about Samuel's death.

37:10.910 --> 37:14.268
It seems the reason Samuel
was on the river at dawn...

37:14.270 --> 37:17.188
He was on the Governor's
business. The taverner told you.

37:17.190 --> 37:20.508
- I might have known you'd be ahead of me.
- What was the Governor up to?

37:20.510 --> 37:23.508
There's more. Master Massinger
is so bitterly wounded

37:23.510 --> 37:26.948
that he believes no man has
fealty to country, king or people.

37:26.950 --> 37:30.668
It is obvious that Massinger
would betray his own scurvied sack.

37:30.670 --> 37:33.948
But would he be so disaffected
that he would betray the colony?

37:33.950 --> 37:37.428
You do seem to be exercised
for the need of justice.

37:37.430 --> 37:40.428
Marshal Redwick has such a
frantic hatred of the Spanish,

37:40.430 --> 37:43.828
he would do anything
to inflame the idea that

37:43.830 --> 37:47.588
we are beset with papist
enemies here amongst us.

37:47.590 --> 37:50.790
Did he place the totems to implicate you?

37:52.470 --> 37:55.348
You've provided me with a host of suspects.

37:55.350 --> 38:00.190
Everything I do is insanely
inspired by how I feel for you.

38:03.750 --> 38:05.750
How valiant.

40:56.030 --> 41:00.508
No! I will search. I
will never stop looking.

41:00.510 --> 41:02.470
I will find him.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.350
No, no!

41:56.670 --> 41:58.670
The baby!

42:29.870 --> 42:31.948
The baby!

42:31.950 --> 42:34.428
The baby!

42:34.430 --> 42:36.828
Mistress Alice!

42:36.830 --> 42:39.548
Mistress Alice, I see the baby!

42:39.550 --> 42:42.468
The baby, I see him!

42:42.470 --> 42:45.310
Come quickly, Mistress Alice!

42:46.910 --> 42:48.910
The baby!

42:56.270 --> 42:57.868
There!

42:59.910 --> 43:02.670
Mistress Alice, I see him, I see him!

43:06.910 --> 43:08.988
There he is!

43:08.990 --> 43:10.950
- Come quickly!
- I see him!

44:43.150 --> 44:46.590
Show me. Show me what is in the woods.

45:28.190 --> 45:29.670
Urgh!

45:32.910 --> 45:34.910
Drink your tea.

45:36.950 --> 45:40.550
The problem with tea
is, it tastes like tea.

46:05.910 --> 46:09.188
Our Father, who art
in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

46:09.190 --> 46:11.508
- Thy kingdom come...
- What are you doing?

46:11.510 --> 46:13.750
I'm saying sorry to God.

46:14.790 --> 46:17.870
He delivered that babe in a canoe.

46:19.030 --> 46:21.548
It was a miracle, Pepper.

46:21.550 --> 46:24.510
There ain't no other way to explain it.

46:38.670 --> 46:40.908
We believe Chacrow will
be open to enticement.

46:40.910 --> 46:43.868
Fine wedding gift to offer my
wife... to betray her brother.

46:43.870 --> 46:47.108
Sharrow is well placed
now to serve our needs.

46:47.110 --> 46:49.028
There is a trap in this, I know it.

46:49.030 --> 46:50.908
I must gain the Governor's favour.

46:50.910 --> 46:54.308
Tonight sweet whispers
will winkle out the truth.

46:54.310 --> 46:56.268
The Governor, he treats me kindly.

46:56.270 --> 46:58.988
I'm glad you appreciate your good fortune.

46:58.990 --> 47:01.548
But he has not named
the time I will be free.

47:01.550 --> 47:04.228
I have traitors all around me, Jocelyn.

47:04.230 --> 47:06.670
Are you my confederate or are you not?
