- THAT'S DUMB.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.141
IN FACT, FISH ARE DUMB.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.743
[toilet flushes]
[together] AH!

19:04.810 --> 19:07.179
- I'M GONNA GO GET
THE HAIR CRIMPER, HA-HA-HA!

19:07.246 --> 19:09.348
- SHE'S A RAVING LUNATIC.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.850
- AND I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOUR HOT TUB.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.219
- VICKY'S MY NEW B.F.F.F.F.,
OR WHATEVER,

19:14.286 --> 19:16.455
BECAUSE I WAS NICE TO HER.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.557
GUYS, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.794
- HEY, N.S.D.M.B.F.T.--

19:22.861 --> 19:25.464
THAT'S NEW SHARPLY DRESSED
MEGA BEST FRIEND TIMMY--

19:25.531 --> 19:27.266
LOOK WHAT I HAVE!

19:27.332 --> 19:30.068
CHIP SKYLARK
IS MY FAVORITE SINGER EVER.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.737
NOT ONLY DID HE SIGN
THIS POSTER,

19:31.803 --> 19:35.007
BUT HE EVEN DRIPPED SWEAT ON IT
DURING HIS LAST CONCERT.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.075
SINCE I'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE
HANGING OUT IN YOUR ROOM,

19:37.142 --> 19:38.610
I THOUGHT I'D PUT IT
ON YOUR WALL.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.445
- THAT'S COOL.
CHECK IT OUT.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.080
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
WITH YOUR CHAINSAW

19:42.147 --> 19:46.084
SO I CAN BE MORE LIKE YOU,
B.F.F.F.F.F.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.854
OH, NO, I'M SORRY, VICKY.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.722
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.324
- I'LL...

19:52.391 --> 19:55.093
DESTROY YOU!

19:57.429 --> 19:59.197
I MEAN, THAT'S OKAY.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.134
WHAT'S A SIGNED, SWEATY,
ONE-OF-A-KIND POSTER

20:02.200 --> 20:04.570
COMPARED TO AN AWESOME FRIEND
LIKE YOU?

20:04.636 --> 20:07.272
- RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT
GOES GOOD WITH FRIENDSHIP?

20:07.339 --> 20:10.008
FOOD.

20:10.075 --> 20:12.077
splat!

20:12.144 --> 20:13.512
SORRY, VICKY.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.181
I WAS JUST PRACTICING
MY PIE GOLF.

20:16.248 --> 20:17.983
- [growling]

20:18.050 --> 20:19.484
NO PROBLEM, TIMMY.

20:19.551 --> 20:24.256
GLAD I COULD HELP YOU
PERFECT YOUR SWING.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.259
- BOY, HITTING YOU WITH A PIE
MADE ME THIRSTY.

20:27.326 --> 20:30.262
CAN YOU SQUEEZE US
SOME FRIENDLY LEMONADE?

20:33.365 --> 20:37.402
- PICKING LEMONS
FOR MY BESTEST FRIEND.

20:37.469 --> 20:38.770
LEMON, LEMON...

20:38.837 --> 20:39.771
- BEEHIVE.

20:39.838 --> 20:41.273
- BEEHIVE.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.008
[screaming]

20:43.075 --> 20:44.543
[bees buzzing]

20:44.610 --> 20:46.178
- SORRY, VICKY.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.779
- NO PROBLEM, TIMMY.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.948
INSECTS ARE OUR FRIENDS TOO.

20:50.015 --> 20:50.949
[laughs]

20:51.016 --> 20:51.917
AH!

20:54.119 --> 20:55.621
- VICKY'S CLOSE TO SNAPPING,
GUYS.

20:55.687 --> 20:56.588
I CAN FEEL IT.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.757
- PTERODACTYL, TARANTULA,

20:58.824 --> 21:01.059
KING KONG, BAY OF PIGS.

21:01.126 --> 21:03.495
OH, IF ONLY I COULD DO A HAND.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.763
- SORRY, TIMMY.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.698
IT'S MY FAULT YOU SAVED VICKY

21:06.765 --> 21:09.234
AT THE SLOW-MOVING
CONSTRUCTION PARADE.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.169
- THE PARADE, THAT'S IT.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.738
I'M SURE I CAN GET VICKY
TO BREAK

21:12.804 --> 21:15.140
IF WE GO BACK
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.408
- DEH.

21:16.475 --> 21:20.579
THIS PARADE
TAKES AN AWFULLY LONG TIME.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.415
[kids shouting]

21:23.482 --> 21:25.083
- MY OLD FRIENDS.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.284
[laughs weakly]

21:26.351 --> 21:28.153
WHO NEEDS THEM WHEN I HAVE YOU,
TIMMY?

21:28.220 --> 21:29.154
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.023
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP IS SO STRONG,

21:31.089 --> 21:32.758
IT CAN WITHSTAND ANYTHING.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.826
LIKE, I COULD TAKE THIS HOSE
AND SPRAY YOU WITH TAR,

21:34.893 --> 21:36.461
AND YOU WOULDN'T EVEN GET MAD
AT ME.

21:36.528 --> 21:37.829
- THAT'S RIGHT, N.S.D--

21:37.896 --> 21:39.364
AH!

21:39.431 --> 21:41.233
I'M GONNA WRING YOUR PUNY--

21:41.299 --> 21:45.203
I MEAN, WOW,
BLACK SURE IS SLIMMING.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.172
- AND I COULD PULL THIS LEVER
ON THIS GARBAGE TRUCK,

21:47.239 --> 21:50.542
AND YOU WOULD JUST WANT
TO HUG ME MORE, RIGHT?

21:50.609 --> 21:54.680
- YEP, I JUST WANT TO HUG YOU.

21:54.746 --> 21:58.016
- AND IF I HIT YOU
WITH A WRECKING BALL...

21:58.083 --> 21:59.017
- AH-UGH!

22:06.024 --> 22:09.227
- [growling]

22:09.294 --> 22:10.929
EE-YAH!

22:14.332 --> 22:16.535
[laughing crazily]

22:25.110 --> 22:26.044
[bees buzzing]

22:26.111 --> 22:29.915
[chainsaw roaring]

22:29.981 --> 22:31.383
[together] AWESOME!

22:31.450 --> 22:33.151
- THAT WAS AMAZING, VICKY.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.454
MAYBE YOU'RE BRAT MATERIAL
AFTER ALL.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.488
- YEAH?

22:36.555 --> 22:37.656
WELL, FROM NOW ON,

22:37.723 --> 22:39.191
I'M IN CHARGE!

22:39.257 --> 22:42.027
NO ONE EATS A MINI BAGEL PIZZA
TILL I SAY SO,

22:42.094 --> 22:44.196
OR YOU ALL GO DOWN
THE LOSER CHUTE!

22:44.262 --> 22:45.363
NOW...

22:45.430 --> 22:46.631
PUT THESE ON!

22:46.698 --> 22:49.401
- SHE'S SO TOTALLY, LIKE,
MY HERO.

22:49.468 --> 22:52.404
[whip cracks]

22:52.471 --> 22:55.340
[girls shouting]

22:55.407 --> 22:59.478
- UH, LOOKS LIKE YOUR PLAN
WAS, UH, SUCCESSFUL.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.747
- YEP, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
HAVING VICKY AS AN ENEMY

23:01.813 --> 23:03.181
IS EASIER TO HANDLE.

23:03.248 --> 23:04.182
- AH, LOOK.

23:04.249 --> 23:05.684
VICKY AND THE BRATS ARE STUCK!

23:05.751 --> 23:07.219
- THEY'LL BE CRUSHED!

23:07.285 --> 23:09.221
- LOOKS LIKE THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

23:13.592 --> 23:16.995
MINI BAGEL PIZZA, ANYONE?

23:17.062 --> 23:18.130
- AND EVER!
