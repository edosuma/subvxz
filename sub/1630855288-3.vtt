00:01.335 --> 00:02.628
Previously on
Cruel Summer ...

00:02.628 --> 00:04.129
She does have a way of
being the center of attention.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.131
Look, can you cut her
some slack?

00:06.131 --> 00:07.633
(fireworks popping)

00:07.633 --> 00:10.886
(couple panting)

00:13.972 --> 00:16.350
As soon as Principal Bowers
finds out it's me
on the tape,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.935
she's going to call U Dub

00:17.935 --> 00:19.561
and they're going
to revoke my scholarship.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.356
-I'm going to lose everything.
-What if she doesn't find out?

00:23.398 --> 00:25.943
-Steve: Is it the only tape?
-I think you should ask
your number-one son.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.737
-Oh, Dad, Luke--
-Is that the only tape?!

00:29.780 --> 00:31.657
Isabella: People are gonna
start asking questions.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.409
Hal: The coroner's report
just came in.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.788
There's an abrasion on his ear
just above the gunshot wound.

00:38.705 --> 00:42.084
I'm in trouble.
I need your help.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.962
Brent:
Luke didn't just drown.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.756
-It's Luke.
-They think he was murdered.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.609
(audio rewinds)

01:07.609 --> 01:10.237
(R&B plays briefly then fades)

01:10.237 --> 01:12.656
Megan: You know we're only
going for one night, right?

01:12.656 --> 01:15.701
What if it gets cold?
What if it rains?

01:15.701 --> 01:17.578
What if we get stranded
and have to live off the land?

01:20.205 --> 01:22.332
Uh, you know, I don't know
what Luke told you,

01:22.332 --> 01:25.460
but this isn't like
a romantic getaway.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.421
It's 24 hours
of immature boys

01:27.421 --> 01:29.464
running around with
jock straps on their head,

01:29.464 --> 01:31.049
competing to see
who can fart the loudest.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.344
I don't know if it's
really gonna be your scene.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.471
Isabella:
Sounds fun.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.433
I mean, Luke would
totally understand
if you wanted to bail.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.103
-No way.
-Yeah, well, it's
usually guys only, so...

01:43.103 --> 01:46.189
Except for you.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.692
Look, I can handle
a sword fight or two.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.069
So, consider myself warned.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.655
(R&B playing)

01:53.655 --> 01:55.115
(audio rewinds)

01:55.115 --> 01:56.491
(door slams)

01:56.491 --> 01:58.952
(gasping)

01:58.952 --> 02:01.455
You didn't think to warn me?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.498
You just went ahead
and you told my mom

02:03.498 --> 02:05.500
that I was the one
on the sex tape with Luke.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.253
-Megan, I'm sorry.
-No discussion?

02:08.253 --> 02:10.213
No, "should I blurt out this
incredibly humiliating thing

02:10.213 --> 02:11.548
that didn't even happen to me?"

02:11.548 --> 02:14.551
She was looking at me
like I was a monster.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.346
I couldn't stand her
thinking that I would
actually betray you like that.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.640
You're betraying me right now.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.100
-It wasn't yours to tell!
-Megan!

02:22.100 --> 02:24.895
You're the one who said
that no one outside of
the three of us could know.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.272
I know, but she's become
like a second mom to me, okay?

02:27.272 --> 02:30.317
Except she's not your mom,
she's mine.

02:32.152 --> 02:35.280
-This whole thing was your idea.
-Yeah, and I'd do it again
in a heartbeat

02:35.280 --> 02:37.449
because that's what
"ride or die" means to me.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.329
But the way that you've been
leaning on Luke instead of me
these last few days

02:42.329 --> 02:44.081
has really made me wonder.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.420
If the tables were turned,
would you even consider
doing the same for me?

03:21.827 --> 03:24.204
(chatter on police radio)

03:30.293 --> 03:31.294
(knock on door)

03:32.879 --> 03:37.259
Hi, Jack.
Is everything all right?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.969
Jack:
I'm afraid not.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.315
The ballistics came back
from the gun that shot Luke.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.569
It's registered
to Steve Chambers.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.783
I don't understand.
Why are you here?

04:01.783 --> 04:05.620
Because there are three pairs
of prints that were on the gun.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.456
Luke's, Isabella's...

04:09.749 --> 04:10.876
and Megan's.

04:21.470 --> 04:25.557
(pop ballad playing)

04:25.557 --> 04:29.060
-Yes! Let's go! Let's go!
-Come on!

04:29.060 --> 04:31.563
Yo, Chambers,
your girlfriend's here.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.317
-Whooo!
-Your girlfriend's here.

04:35.317 --> 04:38.278
-Whoo! (laughs)
-I'm not getting any sleep.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.155
-You're looking good.
-(friend barks)

04:40.155 --> 04:43.325
Uh... oooh-whee!

04:43.325 --> 04:45.577
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.162
friend:
Ooh.

04:47.162 --> 04:49.289
-Mm-mm-mwah!
-Don't worry about them.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.416
They'll get used to having
a girl around, probably.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.293
-(laughs)
-No offense, Megan.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.378
None taken. Ever.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.422
It's fine,
Megan already warned me.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.882
And you still came?

04:58.882 --> 05:01.760
I don't scare that easily.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.762
Wait till later when Jeff
makes us watch

05:03.762 --> 05:05.806
Boob Camp Massacre 4:
the Underwire.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.849
Wait, where is Jeff?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.602
I don't know. I think...

05:10.602 --> 05:12.103
(heavy breathing)

05:12.103 --> 05:14.606
(maniacal laughter)

05:14.606 --> 05:16.483
(creepy voice)
I tried to warn you.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.527
Now none of you will
make it out of here aliiiive!

05:18.527 --> 05:21.571
(screams, laughs) Help!
Protect me from the killer!

05:21.571 --> 05:23.990
Don't worry, as soon as we fog
his lens, he'll turn to dust.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.826
-(exhales)
-(Jeff titters)

05:31.748 --> 05:34.251
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got these.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.631
I brought a ton
of scary movies.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.716
-Even Halloween.
-Really?

05:41.716 --> 05:44.636
-Yeah, I know it's
one of your favorites.
-Yeah, thanks.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.846
That's so nice of you.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.100
(Isabella giggling)

05:50.100 --> 05:51.518
Brent:
Princess Fart's here.

05:51.518 --> 05:52.894
(Megan clears throat)

06:07.367 --> 06:08.910
I would, y'know.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.913
Would what?

06:13.915 --> 06:15.500
Do the same for you.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.168
Ride or die.

06:20.005 --> 06:23.258
Fuck it. Taking the heat
for the tape is a huge deal,

06:23.258 --> 06:25.886
and I appreciate it
more than you know.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.805
Thanks.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.810
I get why you told my mom.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.522
I sort of hoped that
she never had to find out
that it was me on the tape,

06:37.522 --> 06:40.191
that it could just be like
it never happened, you know?

06:40.191 --> 06:43.820
Yeah. Me too.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.197
I'm really sorry.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.408
I hate having you mad at me.
It feels horrible.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.660
Can you forgive me?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.662
It's already done.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.748
Good.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.833
I seriously couldn't
get through this without you.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.501
You won't have to.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.431
You and Luke take the bed.
We'll have a great view
from the floor.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.058
Nah, you and Eric can take it.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.101
That way you two can
finally consummate your love.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.730
-Heard that.
-Yeah, I'll film it
for you as a keepsake.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.148
(laughs, sighs)

07:20.148 --> 07:23.526
Hey! Who wants my wood?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.570
1989 called.
They want their joke back.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.115
Hey, what the hell
are you doing here?

07:29.115 --> 07:32.202
Chillax, asswipe.
Dad wanted me to come.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.996
He doesn't want you stealing
any more of Ned's firewood.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.958
He's afraid you're gonna catch
a bullet in your bony ass.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.462
That nut-job gets trigger happy
if a bird craps on his porch.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.173
Yeah, well, congratulations,
mission accomplished.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.634
-Uh, you can go now.
-Don't worry, okay?

07:47.634 --> 07:50.720
I'm not gonna crash
your pathetic little sleepover.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.515
You can wet the bed in private.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.476
But my girl and I,
we do deserve a little
something for our troubles.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.604
So, Fredo, hey, beer me.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.190
-Incoming.
-Yep.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.442
-Wait, Brent.
-(Brent sighs)

08:04.442 --> 08:06.111
You said
we weren't gonna stay long.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.529
We're not.

08:07.529 --> 08:11.783
(pop music rises)

08:11.783 --> 08:13.827
(fades)

08:18.164 --> 08:20.625
Hey. How you holding up?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.462
I've had better weeks.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.674
I have no doubt.
Look, you're a good kid.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.969
You made a mistake, and you'll
find a way to make it right.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.974
Thank you. That means a lot.

08:35.974 --> 08:39.811
Trust me, I've made my share
of mistakes, and apologies.

08:39.811 --> 08:43.314
Just trust your heart,
you'll do fine, all right?

08:43.314 --> 08:45.525
(Jack chuckles)

08:45.525 --> 08:47.402
(hard rock music playing)

08:47.402 --> 08:49.487
(music continues over newscast)

08:59.873 --> 09:03.585
...but a toxicology report
revealed Luke had narcotics
in his system

09:03.585 --> 09:07.130
at the time of his death,
leading authorities
to suspect foul play.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.425
I picked the wrong time
to vacation here, huh?

09:10.425 --> 09:13.428
Plus the coffee's terrible.

09:13.428 --> 09:16.723
...a stray bullet
found in a wall,
leading investigators...

09:16.723 --> 09:18.892
Did you and Luke
grow up together?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.061
Excuse me?

09:21.061 --> 09:22.520
Luke Chambers.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.981
The, um... the dead boy.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.902
Oh, you two were dating, right?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.779
How did you know--

09:30.779 --> 09:32.906
This is Jenna Raush,
reporting live from Chatham.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.450
Thanks, Jenna. And now
in other breaking news...

09:35.450 --> 09:39.079
Megan. The world wants to hear
your side of the story.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.455
Let me help you share it.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.377
You're right.
The coffee here is terrible.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.183
(Rebecca clears throat)

10:00.183 --> 10:02.769
I should've figured
my parents would send you.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.525
You know they'd be here
themselves if they could.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.444
We've never played games
before, Rebecca.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.404
Let's not start now.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.616
You look well.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.910
Circumstances aside.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.498
I didn't think I'd be
seeing you again so soon.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.041
That makes two of us.

10:31.756 --> 10:35.176
Let's start with
your fingerprints on the gun.

10:35.176 --> 10:38.555
Megan and I both used the gun
last summer for target practice.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.431
Luke was with us.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.642
All right.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.811
I understand there's a sex tape.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.063
Yeah, but it wasn't me on it,
okay, it was Megan.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.649
I just... I took the blame

10:49.649 --> 10:51.860
so that she wouldn't lose
her scholarship.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.736
Awfully generous of you.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.073
It felt right at the time.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.658
Now it just seems
kind of pointless.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.788
Only a few people know
that it was Megan on the tape.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.791
But the tape still hurts her
more than me, right?

11:06.791 --> 11:09.002
I mean,
she's the "wronged party,"

11:09.002 --> 11:11.337
the one with an axe to grind
where Luke's concerned.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.674
It stands to hurt both of you.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.468
But a town like this will always
look harder at the outsider.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.637
Yeah.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.432
Haven't seen too many friendly
faces around here lately.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.853
There's another angle I'm sure
the police will pursue,

11:26.853 --> 11:29.731
you and Megan working together.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.524
We need to control the optics.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.736
I told you,
we haven't spoken in months.

11:34.736 --> 11:37.238
It won't matter.

11:37.238 --> 11:41.743
Just keep contact with Megan and
Debbie to an absolute minimum.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.787
Why don't we just claim
diplomatic immunity
and get on a plane?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.916
I'm afraid that would
look very bad.

11:47.916 --> 11:51.127
Especially after what happened
in St. Bart's last winter.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.804
Brent: You know what they say
about sharp shooters.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.056
Jeff:
What?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.767
Soft boners!

12:05.767 --> 12:07.727
Parker didn't complain
last night.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.978
-Parker: You wish.
-Ooh!

12:08.978 --> 12:11.564
C'mere, douchebag.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.108
Is this what you want, buddy?
If this is what you want, fine.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.027
-You ready?
-Right.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.363
Ooh, I've never actually held
one of these before.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.198
-It's kind of heavy--
-Okay, whoa, whoa!

12:20.198 --> 12:23.534
First thing is, never wave
a loaded gun around, okay?

12:23.534 --> 12:25.745
Keep it pointed towards
the ground till you're
ready to shoot.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.080
-Okay.
-All right?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.749
Or?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.709
Or you could blow
somebody's head off.

12:31.709 --> 12:34.087
I mean,
I have diplomatic immunity.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.547
So, I could kill all of you
and get away with it.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.842
Okay. Let's maybe
not test that theory.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.678
-All right.
-All right?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.888
Okay, so...

12:43.888 --> 12:45.807
you want a tight grip,
not too tight.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.892
-Okay.
-Keep your finger
off the trigger

12:47.892 --> 12:49.936
till you're ready
to shoot, okay?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.062
Now what?

12:51.062 --> 12:53.481
-Now you aim.
-Mm-hmm.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.400
And fire.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.904
(fires)

13:08.454 --> 13:10.039
(fires)

13:11.165 --> 13:12.750
I'm terrible.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.586
No. No, you just need
some more lessons.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.046
Can't wait.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.882
I'll be back, okay?

13:26.180 --> 13:28.308
You gonna show me
how to do it too?

13:35.690 --> 13:38.234
You guys, like, together now?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.695
-(fires)
-Sorry, translation please?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.947
Like, are you seeing each other?

13:42.947 --> 13:44.699
You guys have been
hanging out a lot.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.409
Yeah, it's super serious.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.161
We brought promise rings
and everything.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.289
Uhh... Shut up, I know.
Labels are stupid.

13:51.289 --> 13:56.252
But as your best friend
and her, like, landlord,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.296
I just wanted to know
what was going on.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.589
What did I miss?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.466
Uh... nothing.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.683
Damn, Megan, remind me
to stay on your good side.

14:30.828 --> 14:35.291
♪ ♪

14:52.475 --> 14:55.353
Let's go, yes!
Start backing up
the money truck.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.729
I got this one in the bag.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.231
(door closes)

15:01.234 --> 15:02.401
I'll call you back.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.916
(knock on door)

15:20.962 --> 15:23.548
Pretty sure it's supposed
to be the other way around.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.883
No more casseroles for me.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.176
I could open a store.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.600
How're you holding up?

15:39.313 --> 15:40.940
A bit of a blur.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.402
Right?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.156
Nights are worse...

15:51.367 --> 15:54.579
Well, I just don't think
I'm gonna sleep again until
I find out who killed him.

16:03.212 --> 16:08.217
Um... Jack told me about
the fingerprints on the gun.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.972
You can't really think
that the girls--

16:12.972 --> 16:16.142
No. No, no.
The girls were with Luke

16:16.142 --> 16:18.644
up at the cabin last summer.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.771
Probably been playing around
with the gun.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.690
I'm sure that's all it was.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.569
Uh, there is one
strange thing, though.

16:26.569 --> 16:30.281
Jack said the cabin
was cleaned recently.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.783
I haven't been there in months.
Neither has Brent.

16:35.203 --> 16:36.746
So who cleaned it?

16:36.746 --> 16:38.247
(suspenseful music playing)

16:52.553 --> 16:54.805
-We should get him
to try tonight.
-I bet he would do it.

16:54.805 --> 16:59.685
(dramatic voice) Megan Landry,
top of her class, model citizen.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.439
What dark secrets lurk
beneath her friendly surface?

17:03.439 --> 17:06.317
Is that novel a harmless hobby

17:06.317 --> 17:09.028
or research
for her next twisted kill?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.447
Okay, c'mon, stop,
you know I hate that thing.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.449
You might hate it,
but it loves you.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.329
-(clears throat, laughs)
-Hey, hey!

17:18.329 --> 17:22.458
(dramatic voice)
Jeff Pope, auteur or voyeur?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.961
All right, cut it out.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.046
It's kind of nice to see you
without your camera.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.506
You're always hiding behind it.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.800
Is that how it seems?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.010
Sometimes.

17:33.010 --> 17:37.473
I like how it lets me be a part
of things but also separate.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.977
After a while,
people forget that you're there.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.896
You end up seeing a lot more
than you would have.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.273
Yeah.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.524
I get that.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.319
And what have you learned?

17:50.319 --> 17:53.573
Don't let a girl touch
your camera...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.241
no matter how cute she is.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.541
You need to get a lawyer.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.835
Debbie: I've known Jack Myer
for almost 20 years.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.753
I'm sure he'll sort it all out.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.840
Sheriff Myer isn't your friend,
Debbie, he's a cop.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.427
You seem to know a lot
about dealing with the law.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.679
Just get a lawyer.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.264
Okay?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.600
A really, really good one.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.327
Aww, Laundry,
you shouldn't have!

18:39.327 --> 18:42.121
Nah-ah.
Not a chance, penis breath.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.249
Penis breath?
And that's one of my faves.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.960
-Thank you. Well, I was
taught by the master, so...
-Mm-hmm.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.047
(indistinct chatter in distance)

18:51.047 --> 18:55.468
So, is Luke gonna close the deal
with the import or...?

18:55.468 --> 18:57.261
Eww. Don't call her that.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.764
This whole "bros gone wild"
thing is getting kind of tired.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.058
I miss the semi-decent guy
I used to know.

19:03.225 --> 19:06.479
-Only semi?
-No one's perfect.
Especially not you.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.856
(scoffs) Yeah, well...

19:08.856 --> 19:12.026
I'm just saying, if you want
her gone, I've got your back.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.653
(laughs) Okay, thanks.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.197
But I think I got everything
under control.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.157
-Hmm.
-Now get lost

19:18.157 --> 19:20.534
and let us have our
lame overnight to ourselves.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.495
Brent:
Hmm.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.622
(mouth full) Yo, Parker!

19:24.622 --> 19:27.041
Come on,
we're outie 5,000!

19:28.501 --> 19:29.669
(door closes)

19:31.921 --> 19:33.923
Hi. Your lobster club,
extra chips. Enjoy.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.262
Hey.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.477
What are you doing here?

19:46.477 --> 19:50.064
I wanted to see you.
Are you okay?

19:50.064 --> 19:51.649
I'm just like an animal
in a zoo.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.198
What are you doing?
You're just gonna
make things worse.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.742
Let 'em talk.
I took care of the tapes.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.496
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:08.249 --> 20:10.084
These all the tapes?

20:10.084 --> 20:12.211
Steve:
Think hard about your answer.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.672
You've had trouble
with it before.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.425
Uh... Th-That's all of them.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.218
I swear.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.970
(Steve sighs)

20:27.059 --> 20:29.395
This is a criminal matter,
Brent.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.148
Some of these kids are
underage--

20:32.148 --> 20:33.816
I'm gonna take care
of his punishment, Jack,

20:33.816 --> 20:35.484
and believe me,
it's gonna have real impact.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.403
Jack:
This is a police matter.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.783
It's also a judgment call.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.702
Like when your roof was leaking

20:44.702 --> 20:47.371
and the county didn't have
a new one in the budget.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.082
And I took care of it,
I put a new one on,
I kept you safe and dry.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.710
-Yeah, you did.
-Or when Bonnie was...

20:52.710 --> 20:54.962
what, like, six months
in arrears on her rent?

20:54.962 --> 20:57.381
We worked out
a payment plan that...

20:57.381 --> 20:59.133
if we're being honest,
was an amnesty.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.970
-Steve.
-Or when I scraped you
off the floor of my bar

21:02.970 --> 21:04.597
after you lost a big bet

21:04.597 --> 21:07.308
and made sure that you
got home in one piece.

21:07.308 --> 21:08.601
That's a judgment call.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.604
And I appreciate
all of that, I do.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.398
-I'm just trying to do my job.
-And I get that.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.484
But when I tell you that
something is taken care of,

21:16.484 --> 21:19.487
you can rest easy because
my word means something,

21:19.487 --> 21:21.864
so you get rid of the tapes,
I take care of Brent,

21:21.864 --> 21:23.240
and the story ends here.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.729
Myer looked like he was
gonna piss his pants.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.483
-(Brent groans)
-You told me there was one tape,
which would be bad enough,

21:57.483 --> 21:58.943
but there were six?

21:58.943 --> 22:01.070
-Dad!
-What is wrong with you?!

22:02.947 --> 22:05.199
You know, I thought I didn't
have to worry about you,

22:05.199 --> 22:07.618
that you were on a good path,
that you were squared away.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.832
Your mother would be horrified.

22:15.793 --> 22:18.212
You know, I was this close
to letting the sheriff
throw the book at you.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.382
You understand me?

22:23.634 --> 22:24.760
Don't make me regret that.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.055
-You understand me?
-Yeah.

22:28.055 --> 22:30.099
-Do you understand me?
-Yes!

22:30.099 --> 22:31.976
(engine starts)

22:43.195 --> 22:45.990
All right, let's
play Two Truths and a Lie.

22:45.990 --> 22:49.743
It'll help me get some dirt
in case I need to blackmail
any of you in the future.

22:49.743 --> 22:52.413
-(subdued laughter)
-Yeah, great idea. I'll start.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.248
Nice initiative, Mr. Chambers.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.375
Thank you. Um...

22:56.375 --> 23:01.505
Okay, uh, my mom wanted
to name me Xerxes,

23:01.505 --> 23:03.507
but my dad said no.

23:03.507 --> 23:07.136
I've had a pen pal in San Diego
since, like, the third grade.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.557
And I've been to

23:11.557 --> 23:15.144
three out of seven
of the Wonders of the World.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.814
Legoland doesn't count, dude.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.525
(friends laughing)

23:21.525 --> 23:24.320
-Wait, Xerxes is true?!
-Yeah.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.947
I really need to thank your dad
the next time I see him.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.450
-(laughter)
-Jeff: Okay, my turn.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.911
Um, raw chicken legs
freak me out.

23:33.996 --> 23:37.374
I dislocated my shoulder once,
and if I try really hard,

23:37.374 --> 23:40.002
I can pop it back out of joint.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.129
And... when I was a little kid,
I was in a commercial.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.176
Chicken legs? Really?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.805
-Commercial's bogus.
-Yeah, you would've
mentioned that, like,

23:51.805 --> 23:54.141
a million times by now, dude.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.560
-(girls laughing)
-Okay, you got me.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.312
You can dislocate
your shoulder?

23:58.312 --> 23:59.730
If you ask me nicely.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.774
Isabella:
Okay, my turn.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.651
Um...

24:03.651 --> 24:07.863
Let's see, I saw NSYNC
at a tiny club in Barcelona

24:07.863 --> 24:09.865
before they got famous.

24:09.865 --> 24:14.828
I broke my leg in three places
while skiing in the Swiss Alps.

24:14.828 --> 24:18.999
And...
I have severe somnambulism.

24:18.999 --> 24:22.002
-S-So-- what?
-(laughter)

24:22.002 --> 24:25.089
I sleepwalk like crazy.
I do some really weird stuff.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.882
I mean, a couple nights ago,

24:26.882 --> 24:29.510
Debbie found me in the backyard
practically naked.

24:29.510 --> 24:33.681
-Ohh!
-Freddy: Tonight just got
a lot more interesting.

24:33.681 --> 24:35.891
Right, Megan?
You saw me out there.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.521
Uh... Yeah, yeah, totally.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.273
She was, uh, in her underwear,
watering the flowers.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.734
-Ooh, show the porno!
-(guys laughing)

24:45.734 --> 24:47.695
Freddy:
Dudes, we have to go to Europe.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.031
The sex tape gives them

24:51.031 --> 24:52.533
a juicy motive
that they can sell.

24:52.533 --> 24:54.994
"Megan Landry, jilted lover."

24:54.994 --> 24:57.538
Bingo. That,
with the fingerprints,

24:57.538 --> 24:59.707
and the fact that you were
the last one to see Luke...

24:59.707 --> 25:01.834
it starts to tell a story.

25:01.834 --> 25:06.213
(phone ringing)

25:06.213 --> 25:07.631
I'm sorry,
I need to take this.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.216
It's a grand jury selection.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.260
Hey, Bill,
what have you got for me?

25:11.260 --> 25:12.803
(softly) He seems really good.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.389
Yeah. And expensive.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.599
Where'd you get the money?
Steve?

25:19.518 --> 25:23.439
What? What are you
not telling me?

25:24.773 --> 25:27.067
I've never asked him
for anything in 12 years.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.405
-Are you serious?
-He's your father.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.741
-Oh, my God!
-He owes you.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.452
You said that we didn't
need him, that we'd never
ask him for anything.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.746
I know, but I'm not
gonna let my pride

25:38.746 --> 25:40.873
stand in the way of getting you
the best possible defense.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.374
It is too important.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.169
I'm gonna pay him back.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.795
Every cent.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.756
-Tell him that.
-Tom: We should go.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.674
They're expecting us down
at the station.

25:56.930 --> 26:00.642
Jeff: They wanted to make
a documentary about a witch
that lived in the woods.

26:00.642 --> 26:05.189
They spent a week out there
and all of them vanished.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.274
Someone found the footage
and cut it together.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.276
I heard that it's terrifying.

26:09.276 --> 26:12.529
I'm going to Seattle to see it
next weekend, I can't wait.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.866
-You're a freak, dude.
-Says the dude who ate
a bowl of dog food on a dare.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.285
(laughing)

26:18.285 --> 26:20.704
-Luke: Oh, crap, is it raining?
-Jeff: Shoot.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.664
Yo, let's get this stuff inside.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.291
You got it?
Come on, come on, come on.

26:24.291 --> 26:28.253
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

26:28.253 --> 26:30.255
Chill, bro.

26:30.255 --> 26:33.342
-Whoo!
-(laughter fading)

26:38.847 --> 26:41.809
(owl hooting)

26:41.809 --> 26:44.561
Thanks for
the sleepwalking assist.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.687
You nailed it.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.149
Don't you wanna get inside?

26:49.149 --> 26:50.943
I don't care.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.695
Lisa and I once spent
a whole storm in the ocean.

26:53.695 --> 26:55.906
I love the sound of rain
underwater.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.157
Me too.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.914
Jeff is crushing on you... hard.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.168
No. No way.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.170
Those guys don't think
of me like that.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.340
Megan.

27:13.340 --> 27:17.052
You're smart, fun, and hot.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.514
Okay, come on, that's, like,
the crush trifecta.

27:20.514 --> 27:22.349
Maybe you used to be
"one of the guys,"

27:22.349 --> 27:25.102
but I think those days are over.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.275
(distant thunder rumbling)

27:37.114 --> 27:39.241
(chatter on police radio)

27:47.958 --> 27:51.044
Hi, Tom Galvin.
I'm representing the Landrys.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.422
We had an eleven o'clock
appointment.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.189
(door slams)

28:13.984 --> 28:15.777
(giggling)

28:20.032 --> 28:21.783
(indistinct chatter)

28:21.783 --> 28:24.494
-1, 2...
-Isabella:
What are they doing?

28:24.494 --> 28:26.246
-Yes! Yes!
-Megan: I have no idea.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.040
(girls laughing)

28:28.040 --> 28:31.126
Do you want to get out of here,
sleep in actual beds,

28:31.126 --> 28:34.379
far from the threat
of Freddy's hot dog farts?

28:34.379 --> 28:36.506
-I'll race you to the car.
-Okay.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.134
I'm so glad
we left that sausage fest.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.969
You and Luke seemed like
you were having fun, though.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.931
Yeah, but if Freddy has
underwear on his head by now,

28:43.931 --> 28:46.475
what's the next few hours
gonna bring?

28:46.475 --> 28:49.478
Cabin Slasher 12: The Curse
of Tim's Morning Wood.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.772
Oh, God. (laughs)

28:51.772 --> 28:53.273
How'd you get Brent to leave?

28:55.192 --> 28:57.152
You just have to know how
to handle him.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.864
He acts like a jerk, but he's
really just a stunted child.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.200
I used to think
he was really cool.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.577
But that was, like,
a million years ago, before...

29:05.577 --> 29:07.704
Before his mom died.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.665
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.292
Kinda makes me feel bad
for him.

29:12.292 --> 29:16.421
Oh, no, he still
totally sucks. (laughs)

29:22.427 --> 29:24.179
Steve:
Luke.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.555
Come here.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.360
(clears throat)

29:38.360 --> 29:41.113
When I was in the army,

29:41.113 --> 29:44.366
we called guys like
your brother "Delta Sierras."

29:49.079 --> 29:51.289
Dip shits?

29:51.289 --> 29:53.834
Close enough.

29:53.834 --> 29:56.169
They'll probably have your back
push comes to shove,

29:56.169 --> 29:58.839
but... in anything less
than a crisis,

29:58.839 --> 30:00.298
they tend to let you down.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.969
Yeah.

30:03.969 --> 30:08.640
But you... you're straight up.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.518
You're honest.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.311
You wear your heart
on your sleeve.

30:17.149 --> 30:20.277
Along with
your size 11 Converse.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.535
I mean, I know you
dropped off those tapes.

30:28.535 --> 30:32.205
-Dad, I--
-Okay, so your brother
is Delta Sierra.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.874
He's a dip shit.

30:33.874 --> 30:36.710
And what he did is
reprehensible.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.421
But he would never

30:39.421 --> 30:45.761
intentionally humiliate
our family like you did.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.517
I just-- I wanted
to see him get punished--

30:52.517 --> 30:54.853
Our business is private.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.772
You don't litigate it in public.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.231
Ever.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.649
Clear?

31:01.735 --> 31:02.736
Yeah.

31:20.962 --> 31:23.131
If it isn't our leading ladies.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.592
What's up, Isabella?
You wanna hang out tonight,

31:25.592 --> 31:28.136
or are you only into guys
with girlfriends?

31:28.136 --> 31:31.264
-What's he talking about?
-I just hear a lot
of stupid noise.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.349
Megan:
Come on!

31:34.059 --> 31:36.228
My little sister's here,
you moron.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.647
What do you say we get back
at Luke, make a movie
of our own?

31:38.647 --> 31:40.440
Yeah, I'll hold the camera.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.817
Does this make you feel better?

31:43.110 --> 31:45.403
Actually, it kinda does.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.115
You chose the wrong guy.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.534
I never would've done
that to you.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.747
The tape cut out before we got
a good look at the heroine.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.209
But I'd know that laugh
anywhere.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.294
Used to be one of
my favorite things about you.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.548
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.678
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.648
When did you first learn
Luke was missing?

32:26.027 --> 32:28.655
Same as everyone else.
The day after the party.

32:28.655 --> 32:32.284
And you had no contact
with him after that point?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.035
No.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.121
We weren't that close then.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.415
Can you explain to me
why your fingerprints

32:38.415 --> 32:40.041
were on the gun?

32:40.917 --> 32:43.170
Luke showed me how to shoot.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.881
I'd never held a gun before.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.675
I used the gun last summer.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.219
A bunch of us
went out to the cabin.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.680
Why aren't their prints
on the gun?

32:53.680 --> 32:55.432
You don't have to answer that.

32:55.432 --> 32:58.727
Were you angry at Luke
after the Christmas party?

32:58.727 --> 33:00.770
No comment.

33:00.770 --> 33:04.399
Did you want revenge on him
for betraying you?

33:04.399 --> 33:06.193
Rebecca:
No comment.

33:06.193 --> 33:08.153
For breaking your heart?

33:08.153 --> 33:09.779
Tom:
No comment.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.912
You little bitch.

33:16.912 --> 33:19.623
Ratting me out
to your little Sheriff daddy?

33:19.623 --> 33:20.707
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:22.417 --> 33:26.254
Somebody gave the cops my tapes.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.799
-It wasn't me, but good.
-Hmm.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.051
You shouldn't get away
with that.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.304
Well, Dad didn't give a shit.

33:36.306 --> 33:39.684
-Wh-What?
-Yeah.

33:39.684 --> 33:43.230
Bitch-slapped Myer,
flexed on him super hard.

33:43.230 --> 33:45.690
So I'm clear.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.984
But if it wasn't you,

33:47.984 --> 33:51.696
then it must've been
your little side skank.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.740
Guess I'll have to give her
what's coming to her.

34:06.294 --> 34:11.633
♪ And there'll be
no complications... ♪

34:19.975 --> 34:21.476
What the hell?

34:28.358 --> 34:29.567
Debbie:
Megan!

34:32.445 --> 34:33.905
Megan.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.283
Debbie:
Megan, come back!

34:36.283 --> 34:38.159
Megan:
I can't believe this.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.870
I can't believe
she would do this to us.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.375
Who is that guy?

34:48.962 --> 34:50.005
My dad.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.644
His name is Keith,
he's a musician.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.938
Plays guitar
in some old rock band.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.065
Isabella:
Keith?

35:09.065 --> 35:12.193
I never really called him dad.

35:12.193 --> 35:14.487
They weren't married
or anything,

35:14.487 --> 35:16.156
but he was around
a bunch when I was little.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.284
For, like,
birthdays and holidays.

35:19.284 --> 35:22.954
I remember him dressing up
as the Easter Bunny once.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.498
Sorry,
this is probably so boring.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.001
No. No, not even a little bit.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.842
He always had really long hair.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.680
Slept in late.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.557
He used to make up
these funny songs

35:42.557 --> 35:45.894
about brushing your teeth
or doing laundry.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.437
He sounds cool.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.148
Yeah.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.483
Yeah, he does.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.363
Uh, when my mom
got pregnant with Lily,

35:56.363 --> 35:59.491
they started fighting a lot,
and he was away more.

35:59.491 --> 36:03.411
And then, by the time Lily
was born, he pretty much
disappeared.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.665
Most of the time
I forget he even exists.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.667
I'm so sorry.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.418
That sucks.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.674
I always used to catch my mom
listening to his music.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.469
But it's been years.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.138
Why would she want to bring him
back into her life?

36:22.138 --> 36:24.557
I mean, I know that she always
sees the best in people,

36:24.557 --> 36:26.309
but all he's ever done
is hurt us.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.478
You could ask her.

36:28.478 --> 36:32.440
Or maybe you'd rather stay
pissed for several days.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.526
I'm super supportive
of that as well.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.924
So, what's all this about?

36:57.924 --> 37:00.510
Whatever you think you heard
on that tape,

37:00.510 --> 37:02.053
you can't prove it.

37:03.805 --> 37:05.598
Says you.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.726
I, on the other hand,
have plenty of proof

37:07.726 --> 37:10.145
about how you pay for all
that fancy camera equipment.

37:10.145 --> 37:14.357
Unless you want us spilling
your dirty little secret,

37:14.357 --> 37:16.067
you're gonna
keep your mouth shut.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.867
-You swore you'd never tell--
-I don't want to.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.286
I had a great time
with you last summer.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.038
I don't want to ruin that now
by getting messy.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.168
So, basically, it's blackmail.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.879
More like mutual destruction.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.256
Choose your own adventure...

37:38.256 --> 37:39.382
or don't.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.065
Megan:
Are you and your dad close?

37:58.276 --> 37:59.444
No.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.991
He's older, serious.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.827
We don't really talk that much.

38:09.746 --> 38:12.290
He and my mom are, like,
obsessed with their jobs.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.543
My aunt says
they're like co-pilots--

38:15.543 --> 38:17.253
all they care about
is landing the plane,

38:17.253 --> 38:19.172
and I'm just
some passenger in the back.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.720
-Really?
-Yeah. For sure.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.141
I'm more of
an inconvenience if anything.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.938
They just throw their money
at me to hide their guilt.

38:34.938 --> 38:37.774
I mean,
I'm sure that they love you.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.777
Maybe.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.448
They just have a really lousy
way of showing it, though.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.705
I know Debbie's
not perfect, but...

38:52.705 --> 38:55.875
at least she listens to you
when you talk to her.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.796
You know, I don't think
that my parents

38:59.796 --> 39:03.007
have heard a word that I've said
in like five years.

39:09.097 --> 39:11.850
Headline--
adults suck sometimes.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.064
I'm glad you're here.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.693
Me too.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.196
But this candy's awful.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.573
-(laughing)
-It sucks.

39:26.573 --> 39:28.616
-It's so bad.
-I'm sorry.

39:28.616 --> 39:31.244
I wanted you to try
something from Europe.

39:31.244 --> 39:33.746
It was a very--
it was a very nice thought.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.540
(laughing) But it's so bad.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.584
You're right. Yeah, I know.

39:37.584 --> 39:40.336
Jack: Tell me about
the last time you saw Luke.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.048
I've already told you
like ten times.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.967
Just once more. Please.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.677
Then we're done.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.851
Luke and I left the party
just after midnight.

39:54.851 --> 39:56.644
We parked near the beach,

39:56.644 --> 39:59.147
and then I dropped him back home
a couple hours later.

39:59.147 --> 40:02.108
Eyewitnesses confirm seeing you
leave the party together.

40:02.108 --> 40:05.403
As far as you
dropping Luke back at home...

40:05.403 --> 40:08.323
This is security footage
from the Chambers' driveway,

40:08.323 --> 40:10.700
from midnight till 7 a. m.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.130
(tape fast-forwarding)

40:36.059 --> 40:40.605
No sign of either your car
or Luke coming home
at any point.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.609
My client is exhausted.
We'll have to pick this up
another time.

40:44.609 --> 40:46.527
Just one more thing.

40:46.527 --> 40:49.155
You say you haven't been
to the cabin since last summer?

40:49.155 --> 40:50.823
That's right.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.376
Rebecca: You sure
you told me everything?

41:01.376 --> 41:03.086
Isabella:
Yes, I swear.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.596
Then can you explain to me
why we found your bag

41:13.596 --> 41:16.057
stashed in the crawl space
at the Chambers' cabin,

41:16.057 --> 41:17.600
the scene of Luke's murder?

41:27.735 --> 41:30.530
And what is all this money for?

41:36.411 --> 41:38.913
Is there anything about that
night you haven't told me?

41:38.913 --> 41:42.041
We cannot afford
any more surprises.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.167
He knows about our lie.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.628
Which one?

41:45.628 --> 41:47.171
I am not going to
let Megan go down

41:47.171 --> 41:50.508
for a crime she didn't commit.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.094
You sound so sure of that.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.762
Haven't given up
on our friendship,

41:54.762 --> 41:56.806
you really expect
me to believe that?

41:56.806 --> 42:00.935
How far do I need to go
to prove my loyalty to you?

42:00.935 --> 42:02.478
Do you need me to kill for you?

42:05.982 --> 42:10.862
