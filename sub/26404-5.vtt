17:34.080 --> 17:36.000
because your dummy
will beep back to life.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.790
And beep, Tanner's up first.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.460
Everyone else,
let's talk ABCs --

17:39.460 --> 17:41.120
airwaves, breathing,
circulation.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.170
Or anyone else
can go first.
I'll go.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.170
Great.

17:47.710 --> 17:49.330
You need anything
before we get started?

17:49.330 --> 17:50.960
Some water,
cup of coffee?

17:50.960 --> 17:52.330
No, I am already
coffeed up.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.290
My day starts
at 4:00 a.m.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.210
Mine did too, today.
You must work the early shift.

17:56.210 --> 17:58.290
I get the best runs in
before 6:00 a.m.

17:58.290 --> 18:01.420
Hi, Officer Kingsley?
Maya Bishop.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.170
I get my best runs in
early, too.

18:03.170 --> 18:04.920
Yeah, gold medalist
Maya Bishop?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, I'd recognize you
anywhere.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.880
Man, I was hoping
I might meet you today.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.210
-You were?
-Yeah.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.500
I run, too.
Since when?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.120
Since I moved into
the houseboat.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.210
You have a houseboat?
Mm-hmm.

18:15.210 --> 18:16.750
Oh, my God.
You are so lucky.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.210
I love being on the water.
[ Sighs ]

18:18.210 --> 18:20.830
Kingsley, we need your badge
number on the sign-in sheet.

18:20.830 --> 18:22.080
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.830
I'll be right back.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.670
So, you really meant it

18:27.670 --> 18:31.540
about competing with me
over everything, apparently.

18:31.540 --> 18:32.710
You can try
and edge in there,

18:32.710 --> 18:34.040
but she and I
already hit it off.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.120
You missed your window.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.920
Please.
She's obviously into me.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.830
Plus, we already
have more in common.

18:39.830 --> 18:40.920
Like what?

18:40.920 --> 18:42.170
Like running.

18:42.170 --> 18:43.670
And boobs.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.830
What do you have?
My charm.

18:45.830 --> 18:47.170
Ah.

18:47.170 --> 18:49.500
And this.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.960
Ugh, you're gonna have to
try harder than that.

18:56.380 --> 18:59.040
Good, now begin
your compressions.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.080
Move your hands over
to the right a bit.

19:09.420 --> 19:11.580
He's great.
Cool, good.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.620
Listen, there's something
I need to ask you.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.540
Apply more pressure
to your compressions.

19:15.540 --> 19:16.670
It won't feel natural.

19:16.670 --> 19:18.330
Nothing feels all that
natural right now.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.500
Just be careful not
to push too hard.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.920
You may cause more damage
than you realize.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.920
We do classes every year.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.080
I know how to perform CPR.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.750
And I know how
to teach it.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.120
So, that's one-person CPR.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.460
Now we'll dive into
two-person CPR.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.500
I heard
it's your birthday.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.580
If it's all
the same to you, sir,

19:36.580 --> 19:38.080
I'd rather not talk
about it.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.960
-Not a fan?
-He's so, so not.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.580
It's just another day,

19:43.580 --> 19:46.540
no different than the day before
or the day after.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.920
That's right.

19:48.920 --> 19:52.880
I mean, it doesn't make sense
to try to make it a big deal.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.960
To remember
one specific day.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.830
[ Scoffs ]
For what, huh?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.620
There's no reason.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.000
Screw your birthday.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.040
Right, o-okay.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.290
That's cool.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.620
Got plans after shift?
Round two at Joe's, baby.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.420
Oh, you're gonna have to
hit that without me.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.540
It's Claire's birthday.

what I'm gonna yet.

another one of these?
Hey, you two!

called to this scene,

you're just now showing up?

20:24.250 --> 20:25.290
We got here as fast
as we could.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.750
Trust me.
Not fast enough.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.540
Apologies, Captain.
Eh, don't apologize to me.

the other car.

Man, Herrera is tough.

trying to help.
Let us take care of that --

20:53.290 --> 20:54.710
you could be doing
more harm than good.

20:54.710 --> 20:56.250
The car came out of nowhere.
I swerved out of the way.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.710
Next thing I know, she got out,
and she dropped to the ground.

21:10.330 --> 21:11.080
You're gonna be fine.

21:16.670 --> 21:17.750
Remember, one of the greatest
threats to your victim

21:17.750 --> 21:18.880
after a traumatic injury
is blood loss,

21:18.880 --> 21:20.710
so hemorrhage control
is gonna be key.

That's why we're training you
to apply these dressings

21:22.580 --> 21:24.540

to effectively cut down

field-related exsanguination.

to schedule sex.

Now, I want
to save his life,

23:47.040 --> 23:49.710
not because I support him eating
pineapple on pizza,
