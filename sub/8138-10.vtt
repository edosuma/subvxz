00:01.134 --> 00:03.830
How'd they fit in to sabotaging
the defense conference?

00:03.903 --> 00:05.302
I've got him set up
over there.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.602
My wallet. Samantha.

00:09.275 --> 00:13.041
These girls get out, commit
crimes, and then go back into jail.

00:13.113 --> 00:14.375
One down, two to go.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.972
Sounds like these people waste
anybody who get in the way.

00:17.050 --> 00:19.109
Are you into doing
something a little unusual?

00:19.953 --> 00:20.977
I'll be close.

00:21.054 --> 00:25.081
Inmate and accomplice killed
in a daring escape attempt.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.068
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

00:46.146 --> 00:48.580
into the dangerous world
of a man...

00:48.648 --> 00:50.582
who does not exist.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.959
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:01.027 --> 01:03.552
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.630 --> 01:05.689
the helpless, the powerless...

01:05.765 --> 01:09.360
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:17.096 --> 03:18.427
I'll be right back.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.325
Okay.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.065
Michael show yet?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.108
Michael's always late
for these things.

03:29.175 --> 03:30.904
He'll be here.
Oh, great.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.783
Here. Right on the money,
Julie.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.446
I've got him set up
over there.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.120
This place looks certainly
different from the Foundation, Matt.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.855
Hard to believe they were
designed by the same architect.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.954
Not if you're as talented
as Matt Erickson.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.158
Come on. This is
my favorite song.

04:04.143 --> 04:06.873
Hi, there, green eyes.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.041
Me? Jealous of my friend
in his hour of glory?

04:14.721 --> 04:16.086
She is kinda cute.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.257
Yeah, but can she reprogram
a range-finder?

04:22.128 --> 04:23.390
I won't be long.

04:23.696 --> 04:24.685
Okay.

04:39.812 --> 04:43.111
Well, the Lone Eagle of
the highway finally landed.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.047
Lone Eagle landed
two hours ago.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.745
You were just
too busy to notice.

04:46.819 --> 04:49.447
Well, when you're hot,
you're hot. What can I say?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.988
Samantha went
to freshen up.

04:52.058 --> 04:55.789
When she comes back, why don't the four
of us take a little drive and go down to...

04:57.063 --> 04:58.394
Did you lose something?

04:58.831 --> 05:00.526
Yeah, I can't find my keys.

05:03.202 --> 05:06.660
My wallet, my credit cards,
my office and house keys.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.734
Samantha. Check the ladies'
room, I'll cover the door.

05:15.748 --> 05:18.376
KITT, look for a pretty girl with
dark hair, leaving in a hurry.

05:18.451 --> 05:21.386
What happened? Did the
Lone Eagle strike out again?

05:21.454 --> 05:24.116
Very funny. She's a pickpocket.
Keep your scanners peeled.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.623
I'll do my best, Michael.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.270
I really don't know
anything about this.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.465
Really. You can
look for yourself.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.136
Told you.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.200
That's right.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.604
My stuff's not here.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.644
If you don't mind.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.349
Oldest scam in the book.
Grab and pass.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.315
Her partner's around here
somewhere.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.067
I've got her, Michael.
But she's a blond.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.771
Track her.
I'll be right down.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.185
She's in a gray sedan,
heading...

07:03.256 --> 07:05.588
North on Piedmont
or east on Wheeler?

07:05.658 --> 07:08.252
North on Piedmont. How could
you predict it so quickly?

07:08.361 --> 07:10.955
Matt lives on Wheeler,
his office is on Piedmont.

07:11.030 --> 07:12.122
Had to be one or the other.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.346
That's his car, KITT.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.818
KITT, she's headed
around back!

08:41.153 --> 08:42.484
On my way.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.594
KITT, I need you.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.036
Okay.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.606
She just stopped being predictable,
but she may be traceable.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.241
All right, KITT,
photograph this.

09:45.851 --> 09:46.943
Right away, Michael.

09:49.455 --> 09:51.719
Run down the manufacturer
or distributor, will you?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.988
Michael, over 100 million
sport shoes are sold every year.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.050
It could take days.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.117
Just do it.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.189
All right, let's head for the
semi. Maybe Bonnie can help.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.094
I want this incident...

10:03.169 --> 10:04.830
vigorously investigated,
Michael.

10:05.304 --> 10:07.738
Our Secretary of State is
attending a meeting at the hotel.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.005
A top secret gathering
of NATO defense ministers...

10:11.077 --> 10:12.874
to map out strategy in space.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.845
The meeting takes place...

10:14.914 --> 10:16.609
just 48 hours from now.

10:17.316 --> 10:19.409
My real concern...
Is security.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.720
Two young women can get inside and
pull off a simple scam like that.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.983
Can you imagine what some
battle-hardened pros could do?

10:25.057 --> 10:26.046
Precisely.

10:26.325 --> 10:29.624
But who is to say that those women
aren't professionals testing the water?

10:29.862 --> 10:31.489
I think you should
start with them.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.720
Oh, my!

11:03.796 --> 11:05.855
What a terrible
physical specimen.

11:06.432 --> 11:09.026
Madam, forgive me,
but you really should stop.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.729
Only half a mile,
and I'm already hallucinating.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.499
I'm hearing voices.

11:14.373 --> 11:17.103
It's probably old cupcakes
screaming in my thighs.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.974
This is not cupcakes,
this is the voice of reason.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.981
For some,
exercise is a spectator sport.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.107
Trust me.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.674
Yeah? And who's out there
doing all the spectating?

11:26.752 --> 11:27.912
Single men.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.578
This is one small sprint
for a woman...

11:30.656 --> 11:33.489
a great leap
towards a cute lawyer.

11:35.294 --> 11:36.955
I've never seen
a happy jogger.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.389
Well, I don't get it, Michael.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.225
Nothing's missing,
as far as we know.

11:42.301 --> 11:45.395
Matt, what they usually do is they
lift your keys, they steal your car...

11:45.471 --> 11:48.338
they grab your address from the
registration, and rip off your house.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.568
But what was she doing here?
I don't know.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.742
But they couldn't have gotten
this address from my registration.

11:53.846 --> 11:54.938
That's my whole point.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.739
This is a lot more
than a street scam.

11:57.983 --> 12:00.144
They came here specifically
for something.

12:00.586 --> 12:01.575
What do you mean?

12:02.354 --> 12:04.652
Devon's concerned about
the security of the hotel.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.419
Are you still working
on the hotel?

12:09.862 --> 12:10.920
No.

12:10.996 --> 12:13.726
Those plans should be in the
files. I have no reason to.

12:13.933 --> 12:14.922
Somebody does.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.770
Good work, girls.
One down, two to go.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.494
What?

12:21.107 --> 12:22.836
I thought you said
just this once.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.897
You promised if l...

12:23.976 --> 12:26.069
Stop complaining.
You'll do as you're told.

12:26.145 --> 12:28.773
Do you remember what I told
you would happen if you don't?

12:30.049 --> 12:32.244
Do you want me
to keep my promises?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.616
Julie, you remember you used to complain
about working out all the time...

12:36.689 --> 12:38.452
about the pain,
but it paid off, right?

12:38.524 --> 12:39.548
You can handle this.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.183
Yeah, Julie,
you better handle it.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.454
It's our ticket
out of here.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.956
I don't belong here.

12:44.029 --> 12:46.293
Oh, and what's that supposed
to mean? Now, now, girls.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.562
Calm down. I don't want any
of this on our team, all right?

12:50.169 --> 12:52.603
Practice in the morning.
Same time as usual, okay?

12:52.838 --> 12:55.807
I can't do it. I can't live
through another day like this.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.036
You won't live through
tonight if you don't!

12:58.978 --> 13:00.502
Get her
out of my sight!

13:00.579 --> 13:02.706
Come on, let's go.
Come on.

13:23.936 --> 13:24.925
Where's Alice?

13:25.404 --> 13:26.803
You won't be seeing her
anymore.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.066
What do you mean?

13:28.874 --> 13:31.342
She wasn't supposed to be
released until next week.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.944
Yeah, I heard she was
cutting a deal with the DA.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.911
Something to do with...

13:36.115 --> 13:37.605
brutality to prisoners.

13:38.217 --> 13:39.343
Shame she blew it.

13:39.785 --> 13:42.686
Are you telling me that Alice
is back in solitary?

13:42.755 --> 13:43.744
Huh-huh.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.312
The morgue.

13:45.724 --> 13:46.748
The morgue?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.851
Yeah, she got into
a knife fight in the shower.

13:50.029 --> 13:52.463
Never know who these
inmates will cut up next.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.478
Those girls were after
the plans for the hotel.

14:15.554 --> 14:16.987
Any idea why, Michael?

14:17.056 --> 14:20.355
Yeah, I'd say Devon's concerns for
that defense conference are valid.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.317
Any more on that sports shoe
for me?

14:22.394 --> 14:25.261
It was made by Sportop,
their gym sole model.

14:25.331 --> 14:28.698
The local distributor is Aero-Nastics,
a fitness center downtown.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.462
All right,
let's head over there.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.215
I'm gonna go take a shower.
See you.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.109
Hold it.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.418
Nice, but the rotation
was a bit shaky.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.849
Keep working on it.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.561
Wow. She looked like a 10
to me.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.424
Unfortunately, the judges
don't wear sunglasses.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.059
Can I help you?

15:04.136 --> 15:07.003
Yeah, I'm interested in a
pair of Sportop gym soles.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.266
Who runs the concession?

15:08.340 --> 15:10.774
I do, but we don't
carry that brand.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.271
Really?
That'd be news to them.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.334
Oh.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.879
Right. Well, we took
a half dozen pairs on trial...

15:16.949 --> 15:18.712
but didn't sell real well.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.843
That's because they didn't
have you endorsing them.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.287
Hi, my name's Michael Knight.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.788
Dina Shelton.
How you doing?

15:24.857 --> 15:26.518
You know, it'd be
a real big help to me...

15:26.592 --> 15:28.116
if you could check your records
and tell me who bought...

15:28.193 --> 15:29.820
those six pairs
of Sportops.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.954
Nobody. We gave them to Jason.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.023
Jason Nelson.
He's one of our instructors.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.200
Do you know where I can
find him? Gainesboro Prison.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.133
He's their sports director.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.429
Oh.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.570
Michael,
what's this all about?

15:45.911 --> 15:49.540
Guess you could say it's a routine
with a very high degree of difficulty.

15:49.982 --> 15:52.007
Nice to meet you. Have
a nice day. Thanks.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.120
Well, we issue footwear
to all of our inmates.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.222
Most of them take them
with them when they leave.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.267
Well, I've narrowed it down
to six people.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.202
Well, it sounds like everything
I've heard about you is true.

16:12.738 --> 16:13.932
How does Jason fit in?

16:14.006 --> 16:15.906
Well, the imprint
was from a sports shoe.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.533
The model that he donated
to the prison.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.307
I gave them to the inmates
in the gymnastics program.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.015
Well, then the girl I'm looking for
was most likely in your gym class.

16:25.084 --> 16:28.611
I'm sure these aren't the only
Sportops in existence, Mr. Knight.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.623
No, and we've also purchased,
what, 200 pairs of sweat socks.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.750
Maybe you'd like to know
who's wearing those, too.

16:35.794 --> 16:37.386
No, thanks.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.521
Thanks, anyway.

16:38.597 --> 16:39.825
You bet.
Of course.

16:39.898 --> 16:42.958
Make sure Mr. Knight has no
trouble finding his way out.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.805
Attention.

16:48.874 --> 16:52.173
All inmates clear
the exercise yard immediately.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.017
Sorry, sir.
That's against the rules.

17:00.152 --> 17:01.278
Okay, no problem.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.779
Page Roark to call the
warden's office, will you?

17:03.856 --> 17:04.880
Right away, Michael.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.050
Officer Roark. Officer Roark.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.627
Please call the warden's
office immediately.

17:10.729 --> 17:11.820
Excuse me.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.364
It's okay.
I'll find my way out.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.696
KITT, I'm heading for the gym.
Keep me on video.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.300
Right away, Michael.

17:22.273 --> 17:24.538
Get a picture of this girl
via comlink.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.374
That was terrific.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.476
Wait a minute.
I just want to talk to you.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.552
I can't talk to anybody.
Rules.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.282
I just want to know if you've
ever spent any time on the outside.

17:37.356 --> 17:39.722
You know, like, in a Work
Furlough Program or something.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.749
No.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.293
Okay, hold on. Come on,
let's go. Come on, come on.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.993
Now leave me alone before
you get me into trouble.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.538
I don't know what's going
on here, little girl...

17:53.605 --> 17:54.867
but I'm going
to find out.

17:54.940 --> 17:55.998
So why don't you
just tell me...

17:56.075 --> 17:57.064
Knight!

17:57.142 --> 17:59.633
Okay, Knight. Move it.
You're out of here.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.141
Put her in solitary.
For what?

18:02.514 --> 18:03.947
For talking to you.

18:04.616 --> 18:05.947
Let's go.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.913
I don't like it, Jason.
He saw Julie.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.353
He suspects it was her.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.947
He can't prove a thing.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.625
It's too far-fetched.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.389
Who's gonna believe we're using
prisoners to pull break-ins?

18:17.463 --> 18:19.226
Knight is not the
kind of guy that quits.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.198
He'll keep pressing
until we stop him.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.358
Time will stop him.

18:22.668 --> 18:26.832
We'll be long gone with all the money
we'll ever need before he figures it out.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.166
We will. That's a promise.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.669
Sounds like you have all
the next moves figured out.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.371
I do. Everything I need
to know is right here. Look.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.678
Which transformer is tied
into the security system...

18:39.318 --> 18:40.876
the placement of the alarm...

18:40.953 --> 18:42.511
all of the laser beams...

18:42.588 --> 18:44.647
and the exact location
of our target.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.618
It's all there.
It's going to work.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.792
This is the one, Christine.

18:50.996 --> 18:52.361
This is the big one.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.436
She's rather cute,
isn't she, Michael?

18:58.504 --> 18:59.562
Cute.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.998
Desperate.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.872
Let's find out
who she is, huh?

19:02.941 --> 19:05.569
Her name is Julie Rogers.
She's just 20.

19:05.644 --> 19:09.580
Two years ago, she was a highly promising
member of the National Gymnastics Team...

19:09.648 --> 19:11.081
that went to the Pan Am Games.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.583
Pan Am Games?

19:12.751 --> 19:14.013
Pan Am Games.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.953
Something happened when that team
came back into the country, right?

19:17.022 --> 19:20.719
Yes. One of the athletes was caught
smuggling hard drugs through customs.

19:20.792 --> 19:22.953
Her name was...
Julie Rogers.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.523
And her coach
was Jason Nelson.

19:25.597 --> 19:26.894
That's correct, Michael.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.366
Nelson? Sure, I'll tell you
whatever I can.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.027
Just give me a minute
to finish.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.036
And I'll be free
the rest of the day.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.806
Unfortunately, I'm not.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.011
And they say there are
no more miracles left.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.606
Come on, you can do it.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.276
No, it's over.

19:47.619 --> 19:48.745
Fat wins.

19:49.087 --> 19:50.179
Pain wins.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.150
Everything smells like fondue.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.921
Nonsense. You've only run
1.2 miles.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.186
What about men?

19:57.262 --> 19:58.456
I'll become a nun.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.623
Black is slenderizing!

20:01.166 --> 20:03.191
Gee, I'm so sorry.

20:03.268 --> 20:04.929
Oh, it's okay.

20:05.304 --> 20:06.794
It hurt more to run.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.408
If you want to sue me,
that's okay.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.765
I'm a lawyer.

20:44.943 --> 20:46.137
How deeply moving.

20:46.211 --> 20:49.408
Someday it'll be my turn.
KITT and the freeway of love.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.008
Nelson's a very talented guy.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.281
AAU championship.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.319
Gold at the Nationals.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.024
Coached me for a while.

21:00.826 --> 21:03.294
But Julie was his shot
at coaching the Olympic team.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.956
And when Julie was arrested,
that was the end of it.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.897
Nelson must have
been devastated.

21:07.966 --> 21:10.867
No, no.
He blew it before this.

21:11.536 --> 21:15.370
He was caught pushing performance
drugs on his athletes and was suspended.

21:15.641 --> 21:18.838
Wait a minute. I don't get it. He
was with Julie at the Pan Am Games.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.675
Charges were dropped
and he was reinstated.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.206
Something happened to the
witness who testified against him.

21:30.989 --> 21:34.152
Things happen to witnesses
who testify against the mob.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.521
Not gymnastic coaches.

21:37.763 --> 21:39.663
Don't judge him
too harshly, okay?

21:39.731 --> 21:42.256
I mean, he's been
real great to Julie.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.334
He used his connections to get
her transferred to Gainesboro.

21:46.238 --> 21:49.071
She was assigned to another prison
and he arranged for a transfer?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.303
Yes, so they could
continue to work together.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.637
They got one heck
of a routine going down here.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.917
Go on,
keep it moving.

22:03.355 --> 22:05.016
Little bit faster!

22:06.658 --> 22:08.683
Good, good.
Very good.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.093
Alarm.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.747
You just blew it,
honey.

22:39.591 --> 22:42.185
Find someone else.
I just can't do it.

22:42.260 --> 22:43.727
Sure you can.
I can't!

22:43.795 --> 22:45.592
Yes, you can.
I've seen you do it.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.462
The only reason you missed
is because you rushed it.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.759
I allotted 15 seconds
to the target...

22:50.836 --> 22:53.168
and you did that in,
look, just under 9.

22:53.805 --> 22:54.999
You said faster.

22:55.073 --> 22:56.904
You just overreacted,
that's all.

22:57.609 --> 23:01.067
You're just not sure of the precise
placement of the lasers, that's all.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.443
Just some more practice.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.512
You can do it,
can't you?

23:05.450 --> 23:07.577
All right.
Give me one more.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.511
Come on.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.421
We're this close
to millions, Jason.

23:16.995 --> 23:17.984
Millions.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.127
I've been living inside these walls
for too many years to lose it all now.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.965
She'll be all right,
Christine. Don't worry.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.768
You handpicked her.
You better make sure she is.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.033
She'll pull it off.

23:30.108 --> 23:32.338
You promised me sunshine
and good times.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.006
And I know
you're gonna deliver.

23:36.348 --> 23:37.337
Aren't you?

23:39.818 --> 23:41.809
Okay, Julie, get ready.
Let's go up the rope again.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.946
Ready? Go.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.625
You have got
exactly five seconds...

23:50.695 --> 23:52.094
to get those clothes off.

23:52.864 --> 23:54.058
Ready, Julie?

23:54.666 --> 23:55.655
Hurry up.

24:06.878 --> 24:09.506
This road leads to
Gainesboro Prison, Michael.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.945
They all do tonight, pal.

24:12.017 --> 24:14.952
I know what you mean. Brooks'
record reads like an inmate's.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.922
Numerous reprimands for cruel and
unorthodox disciplinary methods.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.457
She's on the brink
of being fired.

24:20.525 --> 24:22.220
Then let's push her
over the side.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.762
She made a big deal
about her computer records.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.457
Access them for me.

24:29.434 --> 24:32.426
I'm in, Michael. But the system
has state-of-the-art safeguards.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.438
I can read the data,
but I can't update it.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.270
That's okay.
Key in on Julie Rogers.

24:37.342 --> 24:40.106
I want to know if she's on a
Work Furlough Program or not.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.882
She isn't, Michael. As a matter of
fact, she spent yesterday in solitary.

24:46.117 --> 24:48.517
Any other inmates
in solitary yesterday?

24:48.620 --> 24:49.712
Yes, eight of them.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.279
Run their files. I want
mug shots on all of them.

24:58.597 --> 24:59.962
Hold it. Hold it right there.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.524
That looks like the pickpocket
who hit Matt.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.601
Samantha Lawton. That's her.

25:05.670 --> 25:09.538
Those girls got out of prison, broke
into Matt's office, and went back?

25:09.941 --> 25:11.203
Something like that.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.104
Where are they now?
Both listed in solitary.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.339
The pattern holds.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.640
They could be getting ready
for another heist.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.185
Do we have enough evidence
to go to the authorities?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.414
No. Nobody'll believe it.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.453
We gotta catch them
in the act, pal.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.719
All right. Keep the place
under surveillance.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.988
There is a vehicle
leaving right now, Michael.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.724
It could be them.
Let's move.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.268
Are we close enough to scan?

25:43.341 --> 25:46.242
Yes, Michael. It contains
a driver and three passengers.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.108
But we're still too far away
to identify them.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.010
They could be prisoners
being transferred.

25:50.081 --> 25:51.912
No, no.
Not at this time of night.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.723
Another vehicle is leaving
the prison, Michael.

25:59.791 --> 26:00.917
How many inside?

26:00.992 --> 26:02.516
Four as well, Michael.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.652
All right, it's a toss-up.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.125
Let's follow the van and
keep a track on the vehicle.

26:31.489 --> 26:33.684
We blew it, pal. We should
have followed the sedan.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.591
It's clear across town at a
power plant substation, Michael.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.686
All right, let's go.
Super Pursuit Mode.

27:14.199 --> 27:15.860
All right, let's go.

27:21.539 --> 27:22.870
Now, Julie,
you remember.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.006
You give Samantha time to make
her move before you make yours.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.370
Here you go.
Okay.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.817
I'm sure glad
to see you.

27:36.888 --> 27:37.912
Oh, I was hoping
you'd say that.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.150
No, it's my car.

27:40.225 --> 27:41.692
I got a flat down the
road a bit. Uh-huh.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.318
Would you be able
to help me out?

27:43.395 --> 27:44.384
Sorry.

27:44.462 --> 27:46.225
Well, okay. How about showing
me how to use this thing?

27:46.297 --> 27:47.457
Oh, nothing could be simpler.

28:22.033 --> 28:25.127
All right, back to Cruise Mode
and hit EBS.

28:33.144 --> 28:35.078
Hey! Hey, what are you...

28:35.980 --> 28:37.641
Is he dead?
No, come on!

28:37.716 --> 28:40.150
No, no!
We gotta help him!

28:44.923 --> 28:46.049
Get down.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.327
Things look
pretty serious, pal.

28:58.403 --> 28:59.734
Better check his vitals.

29:00.605 --> 29:02.300
Julie, don't. Wait.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.835
Michael, look out.

29:31.035 --> 29:33.026
Come on, let's go!
Let's spread out of here!

29:36.007 --> 29:37.167
Thanks, buddy.

29:39.944 --> 29:42.003
Shall I track the sedan,
Michael?

29:43.214 --> 29:44.772
Scan his vitals first.

29:50.355 --> 29:53.153
They're very unstable and
deteriorating rapidly, Michael.

29:53.224 --> 29:54.657
He has a severe concussion.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.593
Yeah, we'd better stay here,
KITT. Call the paramedics.

30:04.903 --> 30:07.394
How the hell did Knight
get onto you anyway?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.632
How should I know?

30:08.706 --> 30:10.037
Relax, Christine.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.008
He's a freelancer
with a hot car.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.909
There's no way he's gonna connect
us into anything that's happened.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.004
Forget him.
What about that guard?

30:17.615 --> 30:18.877
What if he dies? What if...

30:18.950 --> 30:21.510
That's what happens
to people who get in the way.

30:22.053 --> 30:23.281
They get killed.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.523
It's your conclusion, Michael,
that these girls get out...

30:31.596 --> 30:34.156
commit crimes
and then go back into jail.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.729
Exactly.
It's the perfect alibi.

30:36.801 --> 30:40.237
One of them is Julie Rogers, the gymnast
who was busted for drug smuggling.

30:40.305 --> 30:42.773
She insisted she'd never
seen the stuff before.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.067
She's doing time anyway.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.675
Sounds like the lady
was set up to take the fall.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.536
Nelson, the prison
athletic director...

30:49.614 --> 30:51.206
was her coach at the time.

30:51.316 --> 30:53.784
He and Brooks are up to
their necks in this one.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.911
What I fail to understand
is...

30:56.154 --> 30:59.180
how'd they fit in to sabotaging
the defense conference.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.155
I don't, either.
None of the pieces fit.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.251
What you got on Brooks,
anything?

31:04.929 --> 31:07.295
She should be facing
brutality charges.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.427
The witness against her was Alice
Pierson, Julie Rogers' cellmate.

31:11.836 --> 31:14.134
She was killed in a fight
with another inmate.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.739
Something happened to the witness
against Nelson at the Pan Am Games.

31:18.843 --> 31:21.471
Sounds like these people waste
anybody who get in the way.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.535
Yeah.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.445
And if Julie's work
is completed...

31:25.250 --> 31:26.547
she's next.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.245
Then how do we
draw them out...

31:28.319 --> 31:30.048
and protect Julie
at the same time?

31:30.688 --> 31:32.178
I got an idea here.

31:33.024 --> 31:35.185
Are you into doing
something a little unusual?

31:43.902 --> 31:47.235
All inmates,
clear the west entrance.

31:47.305 --> 31:50.570
Attention, all inmates.
Clear the west entrance.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.849
Okay, sweetcakes.
End of the line.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.429
Thanks for the lift...

32:20.371 --> 32:21.395
creep.

32:24.575 --> 32:25.735
I'll be close.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.770
Here you go.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.149
Admissions Office.
This is Officer Roark.

32:40.692 --> 32:43.024
Just received
Barstow, Bonnie.

32:43.594 --> 32:44.686
11:00 am.

32:44.929 --> 32:48.092
We'll convey to Cell Block B.
Over and out.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.071
Let's go.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.914
So far, so good.
Bonnie's inside.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.013
I don't like this plan, Michael. The
people in that place are not nice...

33:12.090 --> 33:13.387
and I don't mean
the prisoners.

33:13.458 --> 33:16.450
Don't worry. We'll get Julie
and Bonnie out of there.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.627
All right. Let's get as close
to the west wall as we can.

33:28.473 --> 33:29.804
Right here, rookie.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.233
You want this?

33:31.309 --> 33:34.039
Hand it over
before I mash your face, okay?

33:34.746 --> 33:37.112
Anytime, sweetcakes.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.520
You're clear, Michael.
Bonnie's got them occupied.

33:58.069 --> 33:59.058
Here we go, pal.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.100
Break up! Break!
Break it up! Come on!

34:33.571 --> 34:35.902
Come on. Break it up.

34:35.973 --> 34:37.406
Break it up.

34:39.777 --> 34:44.407
Congratulations, Barstow. You just set
a record for being thrown in solitary.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.313
We're gonna enjoy
teaching you the ropes.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.478
Put her in the hole!

34:54.425 --> 34:56.052
I want to review
her records.

35:02.667 --> 35:04.464
Okay, KITT, you're on.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.871
What are you doing here?

35:13.344 --> 35:17.303
I'm trying to stop Nelson and Brooks
from sabotaging that defense conference.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.043
Julie, I need your help.

35:19.717 --> 35:21.048
Defense conference?

35:22.887 --> 35:24.184
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.189
Now, look, this is
no time for games.

35:26.991 --> 35:30.051
I know they framed you and I know
they're forcing you to work for them.

35:30.528 --> 35:32.052
I'll never get out of here
if I don't.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.257
That's what
Alice Pierson thought.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.697
Julie, as soon as they get what
they want, they're gonna kill you.

35:38.302 --> 35:41.169
This defense conference could
swing the balance of world power.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.268
That's not
what they're after.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.569
It isn't.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.277
It's an industrial exhibit
on the top floor.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.112
A display of crystals.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.215
Crystals? Are you sure?

35:55.019 --> 35:56.077
One crystal.

35:57.021 --> 35:58.045
That's all they want.

35:58.122 --> 36:01.319
It's got to be a perfect crystal.
That's the only one worth stealing.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.194
Do you know that could increase
the output of a laser by 100?

36:05.229 --> 36:06.992
Julie, in the wrong hands.

36:08.065 --> 36:09.293
Come on, we're out of here.

36:20.077 --> 36:22.102
There's no record
for Bonnie Barstow.

36:24.615 --> 36:27.015
She's here, Roark. There
has to be something on her.

36:27.084 --> 36:29.018
There's nothing!
I don't like it.

36:29.253 --> 36:31.187
Something's wrong.
You know what I think?

36:31.255 --> 36:33.246
Let's ask Barstow
what she thinks.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.285
Come on.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.364
Come on, Michael.

36:54.612 --> 36:55.601
Michael.

37:00.318 --> 37:01.876
Okay, KITT, do your thing.

37:07.425 --> 37:08.722
Thank you.
It's okay.

37:08.793 --> 37:11.318
Five minutes more in there and
I think I'd be off the deep end.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.057
Think how you'll feel
after five years.

37:14.131 --> 37:17.032
What, do you promise these girls a
chance to get out of prison alive?

37:17.101 --> 37:18.159
That how it works?

37:18.236 --> 37:19.726
Put them in the cell.
Both of them.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.738
Come on. Get in there.

37:22.807 --> 37:23.899
Not her.

37:31.115 --> 37:32.104
Julie.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.843
Now just forget
about them.

37:34.485 --> 37:35.816
It's time
to concentrate.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.311
Today's performance
has to be a 10.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.252
Make sure my car's
at the tunnel exit.

37:44.328 --> 37:46.125
Then get rid of these two.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.769
All right, KITT,
talk to me, pal.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.304
How can I help you,
Michael?

37:54.372 --> 37:56.306
There's gotta be a secret way
out of here.

37:56.707 --> 37:58.766
Locate it,
have RC cover it...

37:59.510 --> 38:01.603
then come and get us.
I'll get right on it.

38:03.247 --> 38:04.373
Yeah, get me Walsh.

38:06.951 --> 38:09.920
Walsh? Yeah, Brooks wants her
car in the same place as usual.

38:09.987 --> 38:10.976
Now.

38:14.492 --> 38:15.823
Okay, KITT, go for it.

38:23.668 --> 38:27.832
Inmate and accomplice killed
in a daring escape attempt.

38:36.847 --> 38:38.314
Come on, let's go!

39:19.290 --> 39:23.124
Hi! I'm here to offer you a lifetime
subscription to the prison newsletter.

39:25.830 --> 39:26.922
Where to, Michael?

39:27.365 --> 39:28.992
Hotel Maximillian.

39:29.066 --> 39:30.328
Super Pursuit Mode.

39:41.078 --> 39:43.069
Now remember,
after I blow the power...

39:43.147 --> 39:46.810
you're gonna have two minutes to get that
crystal before the laser alarm reactivates.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.852
What if it
takes me longer?

39:48.919 --> 39:50.386
You'll avoid them.
How?

39:50.454 --> 39:52.786
Well, just the way you did in
the gym, in that tumbling routine.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.985
We placed all of those bars in
the exact positions as the lasers.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.960
You've already done it
a dozen times.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.757
Now, when you get up
to the top...

39:59.997 --> 40:01.225
be careful of the wind.

40:01.599 --> 40:02.588
And, Julie...

40:02.933 --> 40:04.958
in case you're thinking
about running, don't.

40:05.703 --> 40:08.194
Brooks would have you shot on
sight just like your friend Michael.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.739
He's... He's dead?

40:12.343 --> 40:14.504
He won't be showing up
to help you this time.

40:15.880 --> 40:16.869
Hey.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.214
Go on in and get us
that crystal.

40:20.284 --> 40:22.582
And in an hour, you'll
be up for an early parole.

40:23.287 --> 40:24.276
All right?

40:26.357 --> 40:27.381
So, go on.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.619
Go. Go on.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.026
Go on.

44:07.945 --> 44:09.412
All right,
we're getting close.

44:10.047 --> 44:11.207
Back to Cruise Mode.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.684
Julie could be long gone
by now, Michael.

44:20.290 --> 44:21.314
Let's find out.

44:21.592 --> 44:23.560
Scan the upper level
of the hotel.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.361
I have her. She's rappelling
down, Michael.

44:41.178 --> 44:43.646
She's going to land
on the upper parking area.

44:43.714 --> 44:44.976
We'll never reach her in time.

44:45.049 --> 44:46.676
One of us can.

44:51.155 --> 44:53.180
Great job, Julie.
Come on, get in the car.

44:54.358 --> 44:55.416
No.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.755
Come on, hurry up.
It's all over.

44:57.828 --> 44:59.728
Okay, it's about
25 feet up.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.195
I need all the pressure
I can get.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.426
Here we go.

45:11.508 --> 45:13.874
Julie, what's the
matter with you? Nelson!

45:44.274 --> 45:45.366
Michael.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.137
Thanks.

45:49.980 --> 45:51.743
If they gave out medals
for guts...

45:52.449 --> 45:53.677
you'd get the gold.

45:54.685 --> 45:55.674
Thank you.

46:27.551 --> 46:29.712
Ta-da!
Splendid!

46:29.787 --> 46:31.948
Bravo!
You guys.

46:32.322 --> 46:33.346
What do you think, KITT?

46:33.724 --> 46:35.589
A magnificent performance,
Michael.

46:35.759 --> 46:36.885
But if I may...

46:41.398 --> 46:45.061
Miss Rogers' left foot was just
a hair behind on the dismount.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.699
Yeah, with KITT working
on the instant replay...

46:47.771 --> 46:49.671
you'll be back
to making 10s in no time.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.402
But, remember, you only get
him on alternate Thursdays.

46:52.476 --> 46:54.341
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.

46:55.212 --> 46:56.702
It's gonna be a long way back.

46:57.014 --> 46:59.346
If you ask me,
you're halfway there already.

47:00.017 --> 47:02.485
And just to make sure you'll
have a smooth journey...

47:02.853 --> 47:04.445
during your
probationary period...

47:04.521 --> 47:06.182
the Foundation
is establishing...

47:06.256 --> 47:07.848
the Julie Rogers'
Training Fund.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.058
Wow!
You're kidding!

47:11.361 --> 47:12.919
I won't let you down.

47:13.030 --> 47:15.624
And we know you're gonna make
your mark on the competition.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.463
Looks like
she's made a few already.

47:20.871 --> 47:22.099
Oh, God.

47:22.172 --> 47:26.074
Well, take it easy, Devon. You can always
establish the Foundation Dry Cleaning Fund.

47:28.111 --> 47:29.510
Ha, bloody, ha.
