WEBVTT

00:21.608 --> 00:23.777
There's a burnt cornea?

00:23.777 --> 00:25.362
Let me see.

00:27.364 --> 00:28.697
Yeah, like ice burns.

00:29.657 --> 00:31.201
Why are they naked?

00:31.201 --> 00:33.078
Yeah, doesn't make any sense.

00:33.912 --> 00:36.206
That's a ruptured eardrum. See that blood?

00:36.206 --> 00:37.958
Yeah, but how?

00:37.958 --> 00:40.377
- Pressure?
- Yeah, it could be.

00:40.877 --> 00:43.880
- Over here, too.
- Yeah, that's Lund.

00:50.637 --> 00:51.512
Look at that.

00:55.559 --> 00:56.893
Oh, God.

00:57.769 --> 00:59.729
This guy scratched his own eyes out.

01:00.814 --> 01:02.023
Ya think?

01:06.110 --> 01:07.738
This case.

01:08.905 --> 01:10.322
It's gonna be a shitbowl.

01:11.241 --> 01:14.786
No answers.
Buncha angry people.

01:16.454 --> 01:18.874
We don't even have a forensic technician.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.210
We should send this thing back
to Anchorage.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.296
I thought that's what we were doin'.

01:25.881 --> 01:27.465
Yeah, we're keepin' it.

01:27.465 --> 01:29.259
- Fuck Anchorage.
- Really?

01:29.259 --> 01:32.137
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:32.137 --> 01:34.681
Three feet, three feet!

01:34.681 --> 01:35.807
Need to tie it down!

01:37.267 --> 01:40.312
- Hey! No photos. Delete that right now!
- Sorry.

01:40.312 --> 01:42.731
Come on, Liz,
they're just blowin' off steam.

01:42.731 --> 01:46.777
Alright, shut up, Hank.
Alright, everyone. Everyone!

01:47.360 --> 01:49.780
Stop fuckin' around!

01:50.697 --> 01:52.908
Alright, this is a crime scene!

01:54.493 --> 01:56.870
Why don't you pretend
like you know what you're doin'.

01:56.870 --> 01:58.371
Fuck's sake.

02:18.058 --> 02:19.684
You should go home.

02:22.354 --> 02:23.563
I can't.

02:29.903 --> 02:33.532
Maybe leave this one
for someone else, Missy.

02:36.660 --> 02:39.287
It's tied to Annie's case, Rose.

02:46.503 --> 02:48.463
Then you're screwed.

02:54.219 --> 02:56.221
Come and see me later.

03:41.641 --> 03:44.102
No, don't use that.
Yeah, you're gonna damage the tissue.

03:44.102 --> 03:46.855
- What do I use?
- Yeah, just go back to the brush.

03:46.855 --> 03:48.315
Get a little air pocket in there

03:48.315 --> 03:50.776
and then you can just
slide it into the side.

03:50.776 --> 03:52.444
- Alright.
- Just don't touch the skin.

03:52.444 --> 03:54.780
- Oh, shit.
- That's it. Wilson!

03:54.780 --> 03:55.864
What the fuck?

03:59.534 --> 04:01.119
What the fuck?

05:15.777 --> 05:19.489
<i>It's not looking good, ma'am.
We'll have to amputate at least one leg.</i>

05:19.489 --> 05:21.199
How soon can we talk to him?

05:21.199 --> 05:24.995
<i>Definitely not today.
He's in an induced coma.</i>

05:26.329 --> 05:27.956
Thank you, Nurse.
Just hold on, hold on.

05:27.956 --> 05:29.416
<i>Chief, over.</i>

05:29.416 --> 05:30.876
Prior, did you fit 'em in?

05:31.209 --> 05:33.086
<i>No, they're kind of in a weird shape.</i>

05:33.086 --> 05:35.505
<i>Unless you want us
to break 'em apart, over.</i>

05:35.505 --> 05:36.798
Nah, don't break anything.

05:36.798 --> 05:40.343
<i>Ma'am, I have to go.
We're starting surgery.</i>

05:40.343 --> 05:42.220
- <i>Chief?</i>
- Okay.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.806
Just hold on one second, Nurse.
Prior, go 'head.

05:44.806 --> 05:46.808
<i>I know how we can move 'em.</i>

05:51.563 --> 05:53.398
The heart?

05:54.024 --> 05:55.317
No, that's...

05:56.568 --> 05:58.195
that's not an emoji, Haydn.

05:58.195 --> 05:59.905
Try again.

06:02.574 --> 06:03.742
Merry Christmas, kids.

06:03.742 --> 06:05.243
- Class dismissed.
- Hey.

06:05.243 --> 06:09.039
Hey. No, no. Guys.
Class is not dismissed.

06:09.039 --> 06:11.917
I assure you, class is not dismissed.
Where are you goin'?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.460
I'm gonna call your mom.
I'll call your father.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.629
- Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

06:18.632 --> 06:21.426
Carla? You too? Really? Really?

06:21.426 --> 06:22.677
Sorry.

06:27.891 --> 06:29.476
You gotta be kidding me.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.520
I told you to stay away, I work here.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.438
And I meant it, I work here.

06:33.438 --> 06:36.733
Oh, come on, Bryce.
I'm not here for that.

06:37.025 --> 06:40.320
I need you to explain to me
what Tsalal Station does.

06:41.279 --> 06:42.489
Tsalal?

06:43.115 --> 06:45.700
Why? And...

06:46.410 --> 06:49.413
why don't just go out there
and talk to Lund and the rest of 'em?

06:51.581 --> 06:53.417
That's not gonna be possible.

06:57.212 --> 06:58.839
Do you see him often?

06:59.881 --> 07:02.509
Travis? No.

07:03.427 --> 07:05.846
Death didn't change him.

07:08.306 --> 07:11.351
The fucker only comes
when he wants something.

07:13.979 --> 07:15.439
Did he say goodbye?

07:17.065 --> 07:19.151
Before he went into the ice? Yes.

07:19.943 --> 07:21.653
He knew he was dying.

07:21.653 --> 07:24.823
He didn't want the leukemia to take him.

07:26.199 --> 07:29.619
He brought me croissants.

07:31.788 --> 07:33.415
Fucking croissants.

07:35.625 --> 07:37.502
He had made them himself.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.757
We ate them.

07:43.925 --> 07:45.552
He sang a little.

07:48.764 --> 07:50.766
We fucked a little.

07:53.143 --> 07:54.978
<i>He didn't say much.</i>

07:55.437 --> 07:57.272
<i>He was so tired.</i>

07:57.731 --> 07:58.899
<i>But then</i>

07:59.608 --> 08:02.944
<i>we had talked so much all those years
he came to me.</i>

08:06.698 --> 08:08.325
Then he left.

08:10.660 --> 08:12.370
And then I found him.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.289
Yep.

08:14.915 --> 08:17.667
One last gift from Travis Cohle.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.087
I got to meet you.

08:28.512 --> 08:30.138
Can I ask?

08:33.767 --> 08:35.602
You seeing the dead,

08:38.605 --> 08:40.440
when did that start?

08:42.025 --> 08:43.652
With Travis.

08:44.986 --> 08:46.822
But I know people who are born with it.

08:47.572 --> 08:48.949
And then, of course, there's Ennis.

08:48.949 --> 08:50.951
It happens around here all the time.

08:52.244 --> 08:54.913
I think the world

08:56.164 --> 08:58.375
is getting old

08:59.251 --> 09:03.463
and Ennis is where
the fabric of all things

09:04.297 --> 09:06.883
is coming apart at the seams.

09:11.721 --> 09:13.723
And when you see them,

09:15.851 --> 09:17.477
hear them,

09:19.855 --> 09:21.690
how do you stay okay?

09:25.193 --> 09:28.989
The thing about the dead
is that some of 'em

09:28.989 --> 09:31.700
come and visit because they miss you.

09:32.868 --> 09:38.039
Some come because they need to tell you
somethin' that you need to hear.

09:39.040 --> 09:43.044
And some of 'em just
wanna take you with them.

09:45.714 --> 09:47.924
You need to know the difference.

09:56.099 --> 09:57.476
<i>Oh, Jesus fuckin' Christ.</i>

09:57.476 --> 10:00.395
What do you think happened to them?

10:00.395 --> 10:02.606
That's what we're tryna figure out.

10:02.606 --> 10:04.483
So what were they up to at Tsalal?

10:04.483 --> 10:08.195
I'm a geologist,
so not really my field,

10:08.195 --> 10:11.782
but they were mad men.

10:12.324 --> 10:13.950
Very reclusive.

10:13.950 --> 10:17.287
They didn't come into town
and received no visitors.

10:17.287 --> 10:20.540
Other Arctic Stations rotate crews,
but not Tsalal.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.377
No one comes in, no one goes out.

10:25.045 --> 10:26.505
And what were they doing?

10:26.505 --> 10:31.843
They spent decades trying to sequence
the DNA of an extinct microorganism

10:31.843 --> 10:35.388
that potentially could
stop cellular decay.

10:35.388 --> 10:38.183
Why don't you try it in English? Nerd.

10:39.267 --> 10:40.268
Yeah?

10:41.645 --> 10:43.939
You want English? You should've--

10:43.939 --> 10:45.107
Fucked?

10:45.107 --> 10:47.692
Yeah, fucked the English teacher.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.405
He wasn't my type.
Neither were you.

10:52.489 --> 10:54.324
But, ya know, desperate times.

10:55.158 --> 10:56.201
So what were you sayin'?

10:56.201 --> 10:58.995
I'm sayin' the work they
were doing could end up

10:58.995 --> 11:02.374
curing cancer, autoimmune diseases,
genetic disorders.

11:02.374 --> 11:06.545
Just an absolute fucking game changer.

11:08.296 --> 11:11.091
So, what was takin' 'em so long?

11:11.091 --> 11:14.511
I mean, they've been out there,
like, forever.

11:14.511 --> 11:17.931
I mean, it's not makin' hotdogs, Liz.

11:17.931 --> 11:23.019
Ice coring for that type of microorganism
is extremely difficult.

11:23.019 --> 11:26.982
Requires delicate robotics,
careful digging,

11:26.982 --> 11:30.068
ya know, drills break, deposits run dry.

11:32.988 --> 11:34.614
The fact is

11:36.283 --> 11:38.702
the permafrost is too hard

11:38.702 --> 11:41.371
and it damages chromosomal
material upon extraction,

11:41.371 --> 11:45.459
so it was never gonna work,
like, like, never.

11:46.251 --> 11:51.381
<i>Chief, I think you wanna
come by the station, over.</i>

11:51.381 --> 11:52.591
Copy.

11:54.259 --> 11:56.428
<i>My sister sees people following her.</i>

11:56.428 --> 11:57.554
She...

11:58.013 --> 11:59.514
she can't sleep.

12:01.099 --> 12:03.310
She has these breakdowns.

12:05.145 --> 12:07.564
She says my dead mother is calling her.

12:08.648 --> 12:13.070
I brought her to Ennis last year
to keep her close, but

12:14.821 --> 12:16.239
I'm worried.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.412
Don't confuse

12:22.412 --> 12:26.166
the spirit world with
mental health issues.

12:28.418 --> 12:31.421
Sounds to me like she needs treatment.

12:32.255 --> 12:33.840
Have you talked to the people
at The Lighthouse?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.343
She doesn't wanna go to The Lighthouse.

12:36.968 --> 12:38.804
Doesn't even wanna talk about it.

12:39.554 --> 12:43.141
She went to a place in Nevada,
like, four years ago,

12:43.141 --> 12:44.935
and they medicated the shit out of her.

12:45.519 --> 12:47.145
She fuckin' hated it.

12:50.315 --> 12:52.275
Sure you don't want something to eat?

12:52.275 --> 12:54.945
No. I got a shift coming.

12:56.905 --> 12:58.198
Hey.

13:02.786 --> 13:06.206
Did you see that thing on his forehead?

13:19.261 --> 13:21.471
I've seen that before.

13:23.014 --> 13:24.433
Years ago.

13:27.352 --> 13:28.520
What is it?

13:28.520 --> 13:30.439
It's old, Missy.

13:37.821 --> 13:40.240
Older than Ennis.

13:45.871 --> 13:48.498
It's older than the ice, probably.

13:56.673 --> 13:58.258
Yeah, we got the cell phone records.

13:58.258 --> 14:00.218
- There's nothin' there.
- Radios?

14:00.218 --> 14:02.929
- Yeah. Radio logs. Nothin' there either.
- Hey, Lulu.

14:04.639 --> 14:07.768
- What's this?
- Liz, how ya holdin' up?

14:08.560 --> 14:10.270
What a fuckin' mess.

14:10.270 --> 14:12.481
But don't worry,
I'm movin' it out to Anchorage.

14:12.481 --> 14:14.316
- Ya don't have to do a thing.
- Oh, great.

14:14.316 --> 14:17.444
That is Chief Danvers's specialty.

14:17.444 --> 14:19.738
Ya know what?
The families need to be notified.

14:19.738 --> 14:22.032
- Hank, can you get Chief Danvers--
- No.

14:22.616 --> 14:23.617
No?

14:23.617 --> 14:25.786
No, you're not taking my case
away from me,

14:25.786 --> 14:27.788
Captain Connelly, sir.

14:27.788 --> 14:29.456
- What are you doin'?
- My job.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.336
Now those men died in Ennis jurisdiction.

14:34.336 --> 14:35.962
- Unless you wanna call State--
- Stop, stop, stop.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.756
You don't want this case.
I know you.

14:37.756 --> 14:39.091
What's that thing you say?

14:39.091 --> 14:42.135
Shitbowl? This is a shitbowl.

14:42.135 --> 14:44.054
Well, it's my shitbowl.

14:44.054 --> 14:45.722
You don't have any resources,

14:45.722 --> 14:48.433
no forensic department, no fuckin'--

14:52.395 --> 14:54.815
You're doin' it just to fuck with me,
aren't ya, Lizzie?

14:56.316 --> 14:58.193
You sent me to Ennis.

14:58.860 --> 15:02.072
Actually, no.
You appointed me to Ennis.

15:02.072 --> 15:07.285
You gave me this nice office
in this lovely ex-dental building

15:07.285 --> 15:09.913
so that I could handle the unique issues

15:09.913 --> 15:16.086
that arise in an "isolated community"
during the sunless season.

15:16.086 --> 15:17.963
- I'm here to serve.
- Cut it out.

15:17.963 --> 15:19.714
Those bodies are goin' to Anchorage.

15:19.714 --> 15:23.301
Hank, get the guys to rig the chopper.
We're flyin' the bodies.

15:23.301 --> 15:25.637
Section nine, chapter four.

15:25.637 --> 15:29.057
- Hello.
-"Proper handling of frozen remains."

15:29.641 --> 15:30.851
What is that?

15:32.769 --> 15:37.023
That is the "Alaska Forensic Crime
Detection Laboratory Manual,"

15:37.774 --> 15:39.151
which you gave to me,

15:39.151 --> 15:43.029
along with a regulation
bibliography for my promotion.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.322
Captain, sir.

15:45.532 --> 15:49.828
It says, "Frozen bodies
are not to be manipulated

15:49.828 --> 15:52.080
"beyond the absolutely imperative

15:52.080 --> 15:56.126
"until properly thawed
at a constant temperature of 38 degrees

15:56.126 --> 15:58.712
"or the forensic results
will be compromised

15:58.712 --> 16:00.422
and useless in court."

16:01.715 --> 16:02.716
Right.

16:03.508 --> 16:05.719
And how long do they take to thaw?

16:06.636 --> 16:08.263
Forty-eight hours.

16:11.516 --> 16:14.144
Where are you even gonna put 'em,
Chief Danvers?

16:17.689 --> 16:19.065
Liz!

16:21.526 --> 16:22.861
Hey.

16:32.788 --> 16:33.955
Did you see me play?

16:33.955 --> 16:35.874
No. Did ya see the manager?

16:36.583 --> 16:37.459
Hank?

16:38.460 --> 16:40.170
Hank, did ya find him?

16:40.170 --> 16:41.671
<i>And skaters,</i>

16:41.671 --> 16:45.675
<i>it's time for skating
around the Christmas tree.</i>

16:46.676 --> 16:48.887
<i>Players on the ice.</i>

16:49.846 --> 16:52.182
<i>All players on the ice.</i>

16:52.933 --> 16:56.603
<i>Skaters on.
Skaters are now on the ice.</i>

16:56.603 --> 16:57.896
Even better.

17:00.565 --> 17:01.608
Hello.

17:01.608 --> 17:02.818
Hi, good to see you.

17:02.818 --> 17:04.069
Janet, how are you?

17:05.570 --> 17:07.072
Hi, Henry.

17:08.115 --> 17:09.366
Ma'am.

17:09.366 --> 17:11.243
- How's Pete?
- He's good.

17:12.702 --> 17:13.995
You need to get that son of yours

17:13.995 --> 17:17.082
to do some private skating
coaching for my boys.

17:17.666 --> 17:20.127
Good money in it,
ya know, for a young dad.

17:20.127 --> 17:21.878
I'll try and talk some sense into him.

17:21.878 --> 17:23.422
I'm counting on ya.

17:27.300 --> 17:28.510
Oh, God.

17:36.226 --> 17:37.102
Kate.

17:38.186 --> 17:39.187
Liz.

17:41.731 --> 17:43.191
You wouldn't come talk
to me unless this was

17:43.191 --> 17:45.068
really serious, would you?

17:45.902 --> 17:46.778
Nope.

17:48.029 --> 17:49.156
Hey, Mom!

17:49.823 --> 17:52.075
Go get dressed.
Wait in the car, okay?

17:55.912 --> 17:57.748
Is this about those poor scientists?

17:58.749 --> 17:59.624
Yep.

18:00.417 --> 18:01.835
So horrible.

18:02.669 --> 18:06.757
Yeah, they're frozen into a giant block
of flesh as we speak.

18:07.382 --> 18:08.800
Christ.

18:09.217 --> 18:14.306
We need someplace to thaw the bodies
that is big enough, it's the right temp.

18:14.306 --> 18:19.728
And since the mine owns the rink
and the rink fits the bill.

18:22.022 --> 18:23.398
Well, just so we're clear,

18:23.398 --> 18:26.485
I'm doin' this because
I love this town.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.738
Oh, yeah. Of course.

19:03.688 --> 19:05.899
Lift it up, as high as you can.

19:06.608 --> 19:09.111
- Little higher here.
- Higher. Up.

19:09.111 --> 19:10.529
You could damage the soft tissue.

19:14.366 --> 19:15.283
Good.

19:16.243 --> 19:17.661
Jesus.

19:18.161 --> 19:19.162
God.

19:28.964 --> 19:32.175
That fuckin' bitch. Trooper Navarro.

19:35.011 --> 19:36.304
Hey, Chief.

19:36.763 --> 19:38.348
That's teeth marks.

19:38.348 --> 19:40.058
Think they bit their own hands.

19:40.058 --> 19:42.144
What the fuck?

19:42.144 --> 19:43.854
Hey. Get outta here!

19:43.854 --> 19:46.440
- I just wanted to tell you that I'm--
- Now, go!

19:46.440 --> 19:49.651
Fine. I'm gonna be at your place, alright?

19:49.651 --> 19:51.194
Okay.

19:51.653 --> 19:56.658
Alright, let's have a little dig around
the autopsy files in the area.

19:56.658 --> 20:00.787
Ya know, look for similar injuries.
The burnt eyeballs,

20:02.289 --> 20:06.334
the busted ears,
and the self-inflicted bite wounds.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.669
Yeah.

20:07.669 --> 20:10.088
That one's Molina.

20:10.088 --> 20:12.424
Yeah, Jie is here.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.968
And Merens.

20:15.427 --> 20:16.762
What about this one? This one's...

20:17.053 --> 20:19.973
- Kotov?
- No, that's Kotov.

20:19.973 --> 20:20.932
See, with the ring?

20:21.224 --> 20:23.727
- Yeah.
- Yeah. He's Russian.

20:23.727 --> 20:26.021
They wear it on the right hand.

20:26.021 --> 20:27.522
How many did you count?

20:28.273 --> 20:32.694
Five heads and nine feet.

20:33.195 --> 20:34.654
The rest of them are buried.

20:36.782 --> 20:39.493
Why are they climbing
on top of each other?

20:39.493 --> 20:41.787
It's like there was
something chasing them.

20:42.704 --> 20:47.292
Well, hate to break it to you, kid.
There's no yetis.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.837
And hypothermia can cause a delirium.

20:50.837 --> 20:53.924
They panic and freeze,
and, <i>voila,</i> corpsicle.

20:53.924 --> 20:57.052
Hey, we still got that retired guy
up in the North Bay?

20:57.052 --> 20:59.387
Forensic tech? Get him down here.

20:59.387 --> 21:02.516
- Prior?
- Yeah, I have an idea.

21:02.516 --> 21:04.518
What? An idea--

21:04.518 --> 21:05.769
Okay.

21:05.769 --> 21:07.979
That mine bitch hates you even more
than she hates me.

21:11.274 --> 21:13.151
I might've dated her husband.

21:13.151 --> 21:15.487
Before or after the divorce?

21:16.071 --> 21:17.280
What do you want?

21:20.117 --> 21:22.202
This tattoo was on Annie's body.

21:24.621 --> 21:25.497
So?

21:25.497 --> 21:27.833
It was on the forehead
of one of your guys.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.169
Maybe. So what?

21:31.169 --> 21:33.296
"So what?" It's the same case.

21:33.296 --> 21:35.590
We can work together
and figure out Annie.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.678
No. I'm not workin' with you again ever.

21:39.678 --> 21:43.598
- You think I wanna work with you?
- I do, actually. Yeah.

21:44.683 --> 21:48.395
Take a look in the mirror, Liz.
No one can stand you.

21:49.187 --> 21:51.398
Except for that poor kid, Prior.

21:51.982 --> 21:54.609
But you'll be breakin'
his heart real soon.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.570
Get outta my scene.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.906
Go on. Fuck off!

22:02.534 --> 22:04.411
You know where to find me.

22:11.710 --> 22:14.129
Prior, take a look at this.

22:14.504 --> 22:16.631
Go show it-- Hey, hey!
What are you, what are you--

22:21.636 --> 22:22.512
Yeah.

22:27.893 --> 22:30.395
- Hey, babygirl.
- Oh, hey.

22:30.395 --> 22:33.482
- Want some lunch?
- Nah. "Bachelor" later?

22:35.734 --> 22:37.903
- Evangeline.
- Qavvik.

22:42.908 --> 22:44.910
Hey, Ryan. You got a sec?

22:46.870 --> 22:48.080
Sure.

22:52.209 --> 22:53.418
<i>So, no?</i>

22:54.920 --> 22:57.547
No. I don't think I ever saw him.

22:58.256 --> 22:59.674
Are you sure?

23:01.885 --> 23:03.261
Yeah. I don't know.

23:03.261 --> 23:05.305
If she was seein' him,
she never introduced him.

23:05.847 --> 23:07.349
Hey, can I talk to you?

23:07.349 --> 23:09.101
Chuck. Come on.

23:09.101 --> 23:10.811
No. She's bringin' up all that shit.

23:10.811 --> 23:13.897
You understand I'm tryna find
who killed his sister, right?

23:17.442 --> 23:19.069
You know this man?

23:20.821 --> 23:22.155
No. Never seen him.

23:24.616 --> 23:25.617
Hey!

23:29.871 --> 23:33.250
Hey, no! Fuck you! You think my kids
don't drink the same water?

23:33.250 --> 23:35.669
Yeah? You mining people
are poisoning your own kids!

23:35.669 --> 23:36.711
You take it outside!

23:36.711 --> 23:38.922
And we're sick and tired of you
pretending you don't see it!

23:38.922 --> 23:41.049
We fuckin' feed your kids!

23:41.049 --> 23:42.509
- Come on.
- Fuckin' moron!

23:42.509 --> 23:44.719
- Chuck, go. Go!
- We pay for their school!

23:44.719 --> 23:46.012
Get out, man.

23:46.763 --> 23:48.014
Fuck!

23:48.598 --> 23:49.599
Hey!

23:49.599 --> 23:52.227
Fuck you all! Fuckers!

23:52.227 --> 23:53.937
Fucker didn't even pay his tab.

24:07.492 --> 24:09.077
Did you get the lab report back?

24:09.077 --> 24:11.121
- Yep.
- The DNA on the clothes?

24:11.121 --> 24:12.456
Yeah, that's gonna be a while.

24:13.582 --> 24:16.209
- What about the prints?
- Here ya go.

24:19.212 --> 24:23.425
It was on one of the shoes
and we didn't come up with any matches.

24:27.137 --> 24:28.346
Alright.

24:29.723 --> 24:34.770
Alright, so, we know that
a sudden drop in pressure

24:34.770 --> 24:36.688
can rupture eardrums,

24:37.856 --> 24:39.524
damage soft tissue.

24:39.524 --> 24:42.486
We know that hypothermia

24:42.486 --> 24:46.782
can cause delirium
and irrational behavior,

24:46.782 --> 24:50.869
and that could explain
the self-inflicted wounds.

24:53.872 --> 24:57.084
But drop everything,
run out there in the first place,

24:57.834 --> 24:58.835
why?

24:59.503 --> 25:03.090
- Gas leak?
- No. There's no gas at the station.

25:03.090 --> 25:04.508
It's all electric.

25:04.508 --> 25:06.843
- Then what?
- I don't know, kid.

25:06.843 --> 25:08.470
Start askin' questions.

25:08.470 --> 25:09.554
Okay.

25:11.139 --> 25:12.516
Polar bear.

25:15.018 --> 25:16.895
The doors don't lock, right?

25:16.895 --> 25:18.647
- To avoid accidents.
- Okay.

25:19.314 --> 25:22.567
It comes in, the men panic,
they run out.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.694
And they undress. Why?

25:24.694 --> 25:26.238
Paradoxical undressing.

25:26.238 --> 25:28.115
People with severe hypothermia,

25:28.115 --> 25:30.242
they feel hot, they undress.

25:32.452 --> 25:33.703
You've been studyin'.

25:34.329 --> 25:35.580
Alright. Keep askin'.

25:36.998 --> 25:40.544
'Kay, who drew the sign
on Lund's forehead?

25:40.544 --> 25:41.837
Wrong question.

25:42.712 --> 25:43.713
'Kay.

25:48.093 --> 25:49.344
When was it drawn?

25:49.344 --> 25:52.806
Was it before they ran out
or was it after?

25:52.806 --> 25:56.768
Well, if it's before,
it could be a prank or a game.

25:56.768 --> 25:58.228
If it was after?

25:58.228 --> 26:00.730
Then someone was out there
on the ice with 'em.

26:01.481 --> 26:04.234
No one stops to draw on their own forehead
while they're freezing to death.

26:05.110 --> 26:06.194
That's right.

26:06.778 --> 26:07.988
Keep askin'.

26:09.406 --> 26:10.407
Okay.

26:11.575 --> 26:12.909
What about the clothes?

26:14.119 --> 26:17.289
I mean, they don't
even match the bodies.

26:17.289 --> 26:19.583
There's only five pairs of pants.

26:19.583 --> 26:22.669
- Three shoes are missing.
- Okay.

26:24.337 --> 26:26.506
Maybe they weren't fully dressed
when they ran out.

26:26.506 --> 26:28.216
What's the question?

26:28.216 --> 26:31.636
- Why weren't they fully dressed?
- No. Ask again.

26:35.724 --> 26:39.561
How scared do you have to be to run out
on the ice without any shoes?

26:43.148 --> 26:44.149
And?

26:47.194 --> 26:49.821
And why are the clothes folded like that?

26:52.949 --> 26:53.950
So?

26:55.368 --> 26:57.412
So maybe the killer folded them.

26:59.206 --> 27:00.707
A killer.

27:03.210 --> 27:04.544
Why would he fold them?

27:06.505 --> 27:07.923
I don't know.

27:11.134 --> 27:13.136
Was he taunting them? Did he...

27:14.221 --> 27:16.056
did he make 'em fold 'em?

27:19.059 --> 27:21.436
It doesn't make any sense.

27:22.104 --> 27:23.230
It does.

27:24.564 --> 27:28.068
We're just not seein' it.
Not asking the right questions.

27:33.073 --> 27:35.033
I told you this was a shit case.

27:35.033 --> 27:36.827
Yeah, ya did.

27:36.827 --> 27:38.495
Then you went ahead and made it
your shit case.

27:38.495 --> 27:40.038
I won't even ask why.

27:41.039 --> 27:44.209
<i>Ma'am, the station supply guy
and the cleaning ladies</i>

27:44.209 --> 27:46.586
<i>are ready for questioning, over.</i>

27:46.586 --> 27:48.004
Thanks, Lulu.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.549
You get the supply guy,
I'll get the cleaners.

27:51.174 --> 27:52.509
Chief.

27:57.139 --> 27:59.391
Now that's the 17th.
That's the day they died.

28:01.977 --> 28:03.979
<i>Clark, are you okay?</i>

28:10.694 --> 28:12.696
<i>She's awake.</i>

28:17.951 --> 28:19.786
That's a good girl.

28:20.746 --> 28:22.330
You stubborn lady, ain't ya?

28:22.330 --> 28:25.041
Pickin' fights with those big boys,
ya dummy.

28:26.918 --> 28:28.003
Homebrew in here?

28:29.504 --> 28:30.505
No.

28:31.006 --> 28:33.008
And what homebrew?

28:33.008 --> 28:35.969
Qavvik's is a respectable
food service establishment

28:35.969 --> 28:38.096
with an FF1 license.

28:38.096 --> 28:39.890
And that's why you have
drunken fights in it?

28:39.890 --> 28:42.267
Drunken fight, singular,

28:42.267 --> 28:45.520
was because of the bad water
in the Villages.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.397
Nothin' to do with illegal spirits.

28:47.397 --> 28:49.316
The water thing's gettin' bad, huh?

28:49.316 --> 28:52.986
Yeah. The whole thing
went to shit last week.

28:52.986 --> 28:55.447
It turned black in some homes.

28:55.447 --> 28:57.657
Poor fuckers are too close to the mine.

28:57.657 --> 29:00.118
Ya know there's talk of protesting?

29:00.118 --> 29:01.078
Again?

29:04.247 --> 29:05.874
How's my sister doin'?

29:06.666 --> 29:07.626
She's doin' alright.

29:07.626 --> 29:10.712
I mean, only one in town
that doesn't love my pancakes.

29:10.712 --> 29:12.964
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Cut it out.

29:14.466 --> 29:16.468
One of these days,
those dogs are gonna eat you.

29:16.468 --> 29:17.803
Nah.

29:18.428 --> 29:21.640
Me and this girl, we go way back.
Huh, gorgeous?

29:23.683 --> 29:26.269
She thinks she's real tough, ya know?

29:26.269 --> 29:29.189
You come close,
she snaps at ya, but

29:30.148 --> 29:31.775
deep down, she's a softie.

29:32.776 --> 29:33.985
Yes, she is.

29:35.070 --> 29:38.782
She just needs a little
love and affection

29:38.782 --> 29:40.075
and then she's gonna melt.

29:41.118 --> 29:43.245
For fuck sakes, Qavvik. Cut it out.

29:43.245 --> 29:45.789
- Will I see you tonight?
- No. Busy.

29:47.541 --> 29:49.543
Hey, I still need my toothbrush!

29:50.210 --> 29:53.130
So you do the cleaning at Tsalal Station,
is that right?

29:53.130 --> 29:55.632
Yep. Two shifts a month.

29:56.049 --> 29:58.677
Did you ever see Annie Kowtok there?

29:59.136 --> 30:01.596
Annie K? No.

30:01.596 --> 30:06.476
Never saw her at the station,
but then, why would she?

30:06.476 --> 30:09.771
Ya know, she was a midwife, right?

30:10.939 --> 30:12.065
What about this?

30:14.151 --> 30:17.571
What is that? A cult sign?
No, witchcraft.

30:18.613 --> 30:20.031
Hey, Blair.

30:20.991 --> 30:24.202
Ya ever see anything like that devil sign?

30:24.828 --> 30:25.829
No?

30:26.663 --> 30:29.833
So, when you were cleanin' at the station,
you never saw this?

30:29.833 --> 30:30.792
No.

30:31.126 --> 30:33.754
<i>They were weirdos, alright?</i>

30:34.421 --> 30:36.214
I mean, you have to be a little off

30:36.214 --> 30:39.050
if you wanna spend your life out there
locked up in the ice.

30:39.050 --> 30:40.552
You know what I mean?

30:40.927 --> 30:44.556
Very quiet boys, played video games.

30:45.015 --> 30:48.268
But they were all very
obsessed with their work.

30:48.268 --> 30:51.563
Dr. Lund once screamed at me
for moving his notebooks.

30:52.773 --> 30:55.942
Well, were they acting strange at all
the last time you saw them?

30:55.942 --> 30:57.611
They say anything weird?

30:57.611 --> 30:58.904
Say?

31:00.739 --> 31:05.202
They never spoke to us.
We're just the cleanin' ladies.

31:05.202 --> 31:07.662
Clark was weird.

31:07.662 --> 31:09.122
He was always weird,

31:09.122 --> 31:11.208
but the last couple times
I went out there,

31:11.208 --> 31:14.503
he was talkin' to himself,
he was staring into nothing.

31:15.504 --> 31:19.132
Ya know?
I don't think the guy was right.

31:21.301 --> 31:24.012
And once, I saw him hangin' out,

31:24.012 --> 31:27.140
<i>au naturel,</i>
skinny ass just hangin' out.

31:27.140 --> 31:30.852
He would be locked in his room.
We couldn't go clean in there.

31:30.852 --> 31:32.479
He wouldn't come out.

31:32.854 --> 31:34.481
I heard him crying.

31:35.690 --> 31:39.611
What did the other men do
when he was acting off?

31:39.611 --> 31:41.696
They just ignored him.

31:42.197 --> 31:43.615
It was sad.

31:44.074 --> 31:47.536
I thought I saw somebody
when I got to the station yesterday,

31:47.536 --> 31:50.038
but it couldn't be, right?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.165
Wait, you saw somebody
at the station?

31:55.127 --> 31:57.796
No, I didn't see no one.
Nope.

31:57.796 --> 31:59.297
Bill, come on. This is serious.

31:59.297 --> 32:01.466
- If you saw someone, you gotta tell me.
- This is Ennis, man.

32:01.466 --> 32:04.386
Yeah. You see people sometimes.

32:04.386 --> 32:05.679
Know what I mean?

32:07.431 --> 32:10.225
Jesus, Pete. You grew up here.
You know this.

32:10.225 --> 32:12.310
You see people who are gone sometimes.

32:12.310 --> 32:14.312
It's a long fuckin' night.

32:14.312 --> 32:15.730
Even the dead get bored.

32:16.898 --> 32:19.526
Hey, have you seen this before?

32:20.318 --> 32:23.113
Yeah. Clark had that thing.

32:23.113 --> 32:24.406
Had it?

32:24.990 --> 32:27.409
He had it tattooed on his chest.

32:31.621 --> 32:33.832
<i>The guy you're looking
for is Chuck Mosley.</i>

32:33.832 --> 32:38.503
<i>Block 16C, room 43,
Silver Sky Mining Barracks.</i>

32:38.503 --> 32:40.380
<i>I texted you the location, over.</i>

32:40.380 --> 32:43.091
Thanks, Lee. Owe you one, over.

32:49.723 --> 32:51.266
Oh, shit.

32:53.518 --> 32:57.939
Hey, Jules! You hear that, sis?
It's our song, babygirl!

33:02.652 --> 33:03.737
Fuck.

33:21.797 --> 33:23.173
Fuck.

33:47.656 --> 33:50.867
- I told you, I don't know him.
- You were lying.

33:51.701 --> 33:54.746
Don't make me arrest you for stiffin'
the bill at Qavvik's.

34:02.712 --> 34:04.339
He bought my cousin's trailer.

34:04.965 --> 34:07.843
A Golden Eagle from the fuckin' '90s.

34:07.843 --> 34:11.430
But my cousin made this idiot
shell out ten grand.

34:12.472 --> 34:15.892
Guy paid in cash, right there. Boom.

34:16.601 --> 34:18.061
And when was this?

34:18.061 --> 34:21.148
I don't know. Seven years ago?

34:22.482 --> 34:24.484
Can't you ask your cousin?

34:25.026 --> 34:26.236
Dead.

34:27.154 --> 34:28.572
Bone cancer.

34:29.322 --> 34:30.741
This fuckin' town.

34:33.243 --> 34:36.496
Write the description of the trailer
and your cousin's name.

34:45.839 --> 34:48.258
Why didn't you tell me when I asked?

34:48.258 --> 34:50.343
'Cause I don't like you, ma'am.

34:55.432 --> 34:56.641
Nah.

34:58.477 --> 35:01.897
It's because you didn't
like Annie, isn't it?

35:04.691 --> 35:07.110
You're okay with what happened to her.

35:42.395 --> 35:45.440
Don't worry, babe.
I've still got a little cash left.

35:45.440 --> 35:48.693
I'll send ya some more
for your mother's medication.

35:48.693 --> 35:49.945
Can't wait to see you.

35:58.328 --> 35:59.329
Alright.

36:21.226 --> 36:24.771
Wallis said he had the spiral tattooed
on his chest.

36:26.356 --> 36:29.109
Why was Wallis lookin' at his chest?

36:29.109 --> 36:33.280
Clark was walking around naked,
talking to himself.

36:33.280 --> 36:36.116
Yeah, he was not okay.

36:36.950 --> 36:39.536
I don't get why the other guys were
puttin' up with him.

36:39.536 --> 36:41.371
Well, that's exactly the question.

36:42.164 --> 36:44.124
Alright, well,
did you get ahold of the family?

36:44.124 --> 36:47.085
Yeah. I spoke to his mom in Dublin.

36:47.085 --> 36:50.380
She hasn't seen him for 10 years.
Says he's dead to her.

36:51.298 --> 36:53.925
Well, he is dead.
Jesus.

36:55.302 --> 36:56.511
Okay.

36:57.888 --> 36:59.598
What'd we learn about the money?

36:59.598 --> 37:01.725
So, who's paying Tsalal's bills?

37:01.725 --> 37:05.437
Okay, so,
the NGO that funds the station, right,

37:05.437 --> 37:07.564
if you follow the taxes,
you can trace it back

37:07.564 --> 37:11.026
to a shell company called
NC Global Strategies,

37:11.026 --> 37:14.780
which, in turn, belongs to Tuttle United.

37:15.739 --> 37:17.115
Tuttle United. What do they do?

37:17.115 --> 37:19.493
Everything. I mean, glass, tech,

37:19.493 --> 37:23.914
video games, shipments,
palm oil, cruise lines.

37:23.914 --> 37:27.709
Okay. Thanks, Petey, 'cause that,

37:27.709 --> 37:29.586
that was really not helpful.

37:30.754 --> 37:32.339
I'm here to serve.

37:33.173 --> 37:35.926
Alright. Okay.

37:36.635 --> 37:38.678
Chief, can I ask you a question?

37:38.678 --> 37:39.971
Yeah.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.307
What did Navarro do to you?

37:44.434 --> 37:46.061
You worried you're gonna fuck up too?

37:47.354 --> 37:48.939
Well, don't fuck up.

37:48.939 --> 37:51.900
Go watch the corpsicle.
I'm gonna go pick up Leah at your place,

37:51.900 --> 37:53.652
then I'm goin' back to work.

37:53.652 --> 37:55.153
Nah, I gotta go home.

37:56.279 --> 37:58.240
I can't.
I promised I'd put Darwin to bed.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.201
- Kayla will kill me.
- You're not goin' home tonight.

38:01.201 --> 38:02.702
What'd I just say?

38:04.454 --> 38:05.789
Don't fuck up.

38:15.841 --> 38:17.259
<i>What do you mean "no"?</i>

38:17.843 --> 38:20.470
You said you were giving Darwin
a bath tonight.

38:21.596 --> 38:24.182
No, he wants you doing it, not me.

38:24.182 --> 38:26.435
<i>Come on, help me out here.</i>

38:26.435 --> 38:28.478
I don't know what you want me to tell you.

38:28.478 --> 38:29.855
<i>I promise I'll do it next time.</i>

38:29.855 --> 38:31.940
Yeah, that's what you said last time.

38:32.983 --> 38:34.776
I don't know what you want me to tell you.
He's waiting for you.

38:34.776 --> 38:36.570
Hey. Hi, Darwin.

38:36.570 --> 38:39.322
- Hey, your boss is here.
- Makin' Legos?

38:39.322 --> 38:40.949
- Yeah.
- <i>I'm sorry, alright?</i>

38:40.949 --> 38:42.409
- Whatever.
- Whatcha makin'?

38:42.409 --> 38:44.619
- A house.
- A house for the fish?

38:46.371 --> 38:48.206
So you takin' my man again tonight?

38:50.375 --> 38:55.547
You don't know this, Kayla,
but I'm doin' you a big favor.

38:55.547 --> 38:58.383
Pretty soon, you're gonna get sick of
havin' the husband around.

38:58.383 --> 39:01.011
Thanks, but you can save
your favors for your family.

39:02.971 --> 39:04.473
She's in the kitchen with my grandma.

39:09.978 --> 39:12.189
Come on, baby.
Bath time. Let's go.

39:13.231 --> 39:15.067
Leah, we gotta go. I gotta get--

39:15.067 --> 39:16.318
Hi, Liz.

39:16.318 --> 39:18.695
Leah wanted to see what
kakiniit'd look like

39:18.695 --> 39:20.614
- on her beautiful face.
- Hey!

39:20.614 --> 39:21.656
Wash it off.

39:22.199 --> 39:23.992
- No.
- It's just marker.

39:23.992 --> 39:25.911
- It'll come right off.
- Go get in the car.

39:26.453 --> 39:27.579
Go!

39:30.707 --> 39:32.292
You don't get to doodle on my kid's face.

39:32.292 --> 39:36.088
She's 17, and she wants
to understand her heritage.

39:37.422 --> 39:39.132
What, so she can be
a night nurse like you?

39:40.050 --> 39:43.845
Yeah. Don't give me that,
Laundromat Grandma.

39:44.387 --> 39:46.181
You need to leave my house.

39:48.058 --> 39:49.059
Now!

40:08.328 --> 40:09.329
Really?

40:09.788 --> 40:12.040
I mean, since you're paying,

40:12.040 --> 40:13.750
I'm getting my nutrients.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.127
Nutrients.

40:15.752 --> 40:17.754
Twenty for some damn cookies?

40:18.213 --> 40:20.215
Arctic prices, babe.

40:21.383 --> 40:22.801
Remind me again why we're here?

40:24.094 --> 40:25.679
Good job benefits.

40:26.555 --> 40:28.390
Good job benefits.

40:30.892 --> 40:32.853
Hey, so, I've been thinkin'.

40:34.229 --> 40:36.231
That place, The Lighthouse?

40:36.231 --> 40:38.233
Maybe we should go by
and talk to someone.

40:38.233 --> 40:39.776
I'm not goin' back into a hospital.

40:39.776 --> 40:42.654
Those pills. You don't get it.

40:42.654 --> 40:44.114
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen.

40:44.114 --> 40:45.907
Hey, look at me. It's not a hospital.

40:45.907 --> 40:49.911
It's a community center
for addictions and other issues.

40:49.911 --> 40:52.956
Okay?
I think we should go check it out.

40:52.956 --> 40:55.667
- I mean, there's other meds, and--
- No.

40:57.002 --> 40:59.004
Listen, I'm not Mom.

40:59.755 --> 41:01.715
- Please, Angie.
- Okay, okay.

41:01.715 --> 41:04.092
You gotta let me live
like a normal person.

41:04.092 --> 41:05.385
Okay.

41:06.678 --> 41:08.513
Of course, babygirl.

41:48.053 --> 41:51.598
Leah, help me put up this stupid
fucking Christmas tree!

41:56.061 --> 41:57.813
You do it! I'm in bed!

42:44.985 --> 42:46.862
This place is crazy.

42:47.821 --> 42:49.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:52.701 --> 42:53.660
You did it.

42:54.035 --> 42:55.579
They're just temporary.

42:55.579 --> 42:58.081
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

43:05.255 --> 43:06.465
Fuck.

43:28.403 --> 43:29.821
I see you!

43:29.821 --> 43:31.573
I'm the one eye.

43:36.286 --> 43:38.455
I see you. I see you.

44:12.572 --> 44:13.990
Fuck.

44:15.742 --> 44:17.702
- Hey, Chief.
- <i>Pete, did you get</i>

44:17.702 --> 44:19.204
<i>the scientists' credit history?</i>

44:19.204 --> 44:21.289
- Yeah.
- <i>Alright. Send me Clark's,</i>

44:21.289 --> 44:22.874
<i>as far back as you can go.</i>

44:22.874 --> 44:25.210
Okay. You want me to include the--

44:29.840 --> 44:32.259
You don't go into my house to steal.

44:32.717 --> 44:33.927
You know better.

44:35.554 --> 44:36.972
Look at me.

44:38.765 --> 44:40.183
Look at me.

44:43.770 --> 44:46.773
Even your mother didn't steal from us
when she left.

44:48.692 --> 44:49.901
Now listen,

44:50.736 --> 44:52.946
Danvers doesn't own you.

44:54.281 --> 44:56.908
You have a family and she's not it.

44:58.744 --> 45:01.747
Blood is blood, Peter.

45:04.541 --> 45:05.959
Remember that.

45:34.696 --> 45:38.075
So, you fucked me with the bodies,
then you come to actually fuck me.

45:39.576 --> 45:41.328
You want to or not?

45:43.163 --> 45:44.372
Yeah.

45:45.290 --> 45:48.502
I know you didn't stay in town
for the lovely weather.

45:59.304 --> 46:00.555
No.

46:03.892 --> 46:06.478
- I can't!
- No, no! Don't you dare.

46:06.478 --> 46:08.271
Don't you dare! No. Wait, wait, wait!

46:08.271 --> 46:09.272
Wait!

46:29.960 --> 46:31.962
You're sweatin' on me.

46:46.101 --> 46:49.104
Do you wanna say it first or should I?

46:50.188 --> 46:51.773
That's the last time we do this.

46:52.858 --> 46:54.901
That's 15 years of last times.

46:54.901 --> 46:57.487
- Nineteen.
- What? No.

46:57.487 --> 47:01.116
- Nineteen years ago, I just got married.
- Nineteen years.

47:04.619 --> 47:06.288
You were with Jake.

47:07.289 --> 47:09.291
Yeah, we were on a break.

47:10.083 --> 47:11.293
One of 'em.

47:12.794 --> 47:14.129
Fuck.

47:15.464 --> 47:17.466
This is the last time we do this.

47:19.926 --> 47:20.927
Yeah.

47:26.933 --> 47:29.561
What are you doing
with the Tsalal thing, Liz?

47:30.395 --> 47:31.438
Really.

47:32.272 --> 47:35.108
I know ya don't want the case.
I know you.

47:35.567 --> 47:36.777
Oh, you do?

47:37.486 --> 47:38.695
What am I thinking right now?

47:38.695 --> 47:40.947
You're thinking,
"Know why I want the case?"

47:40.947 --> 47:43.075
- Why?
-"'Cause fuck you, that's why."

47:44.785 --> 47:46.411
I guess you do know me.

47:48.371 --> 47:50.957
- You sent me to Ennis so that I--
- No, I gave you

47:50.957 --> 47:52.667
- a promotion.
- Whatever reason.

47:52.667 --> 47:55.629
I mean, mostly because
you're an insecure asshole,

47:55.629 --> 47:58.215
and because you're scared of me,
but whatever.

47:58.215 --> 48:00.008
I'm just doin' my job.

48:00.008 --> 48:03.303
You're not doin' your job.
You're messin' with me.

48:06.348 --> 48:09.976
Why are you so hell-bent
on keepin' a lid on it?

48:10.310 --> 48:12.437
Well, I just don't want it
to turn into a fuckin'

48:12.437 --> 48:14.773
disaster for no reason.

48:14.773 --> 48:17.484
Weird circumstances. Dead bodies.

48:18.318 --> 48:20.404
Come on, let's run it out of Anchorage.

48:20.404 --> 48:21.696
No.

48:23.031 --> 48:25.409
I'm gonna keep control of it.

48:25.409 --> 48:28.328
- I got it controlled.
- Yeah, well, I don't think you can.

48:28.912 --> 48:31.206
- Well, I can.
- You can't.

48:31.206 --> 48:33.333
- Says who?
- Me.

48:33.333 --> 48:35.627
- And, I swear, if you don't--
- What?

48:36.962 --> 48:38.964
Are you fuckin' threatening me?

48:48.807 --> 48:50.016
Fucker.

48:56.189 --> 48:58.775
Yeah, I'm lookin' at it right here.

48:58.775 --> 49:00.485
It's a $600 charge.

49:01.069 --> 49:05.407
Fairbanks Ink Tattoo,
April 22nd, 2017.

49:06.158 --> 49:08.034
<i>Clark you said, yeah?</i>

49:08.034 --> 49:09.536
Yeah. Raymond Clark.

49:10.120 --> 49:13.331
His tattoo was on his chest.
It's a spiral.

49:13.331 --> 49:15.000
I can send it to you
right now if you want.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.544
<i>No need.
I have it right here.</i>

49:17.544 --> 49:20.672
<i>Yeah, I remember him. Weird guy.</i>

49:20.672 --> 49:23.049
<i>- English, right?</i>
- No, he was Irish.

49:23.049 --> 49:25.469
<i>He cried a little when I finished.</i>

49:25.469 --> 49:30.348
<i>Not because it hurt, ya know?
Just sentimental, maybe.</i>

49:30.348 --> 49:31.433
Was he alone?

49:32.100 --> 49:33.935
<i>He was alone, yeah.</i>

49:35.061 --> 49:37.314
Did he tell you what it meant?
The tattoo?

49:39.107 --> 49:40.609
<i>That I don't remember.</i>

49:41.151 --> 49:43.779
<i>Wait. I can send you
a photo of the tattoo.</i>

49:44.404 --> 49:46.281
<i>I keep them for my records.</i>

49:49.993 --> 49:53.205
<i>And here's one showing
the model for the work.</i>

49:56.124 --> 49:57.334
<i>Lady?</i>

49:58.251 --> 49:59.127
<i>Hello?</i>

50:19.940 --> 50:22.359
Guess I should start locking.

50:25.612 --> 50:28.824
He took this photo
to a studio in Fairbanks.

50:32.369 --> 50:34.579
He got the same tattoo as her.

50:35.997 --> 50:37.833
That's four days after she died.

50:40.293 --> 50:41.920
Here's the DNA results.

50:42.504 --> 50:44.756
That was Annie's tongue at Tsalal.

50:47.551 --> 50:52.556
Tissue has some
unusual cellular damage

50:53.181 --> 50:55.016
possibly from freezing.

50:56.143 --> 50:57.978
Did you change where you put the cans?

50:59.479 --> 51:00.897
Where do the cans go?

51:06.695 --> 51:10.574
Well, it looks like your case is my case.

51:15.036 --> 51:16.246
What are you doin' here?

51:17.038 --> 51:19.416
Well, you know Annie better
than I can get from the files.

51:21.585 --> 51:24.171
And now it matters
because it's a buncha white men?

51:25.046 --> 51:27.674
You want in or do you just wanna
go fuck yourself?

51:35.223 --> 51:38.643
- Listen, the Wheeler thing was--
- Shut up.

51:39.144 --> 51:42.647
- No, we did exactly what we needed to do.
- No, we're not doin' that.

51:42.647 --> 51:45.692
Alright? We're just doin' this one thing.

51:46.485 --> 51:47.986
We're gonna crack it, close your case,

51:47.986 --> 51:51.823
I close my case, and then,
that's it for the two of us.

51:56.411 --> 51:57.829
It is.

52:37.994 --> 52:39.830
- Boo!
- Fuck!

52:41.748 --> 52:44.334
- Hi.
- Jesus Christ, Leah.

52:44.334 --> 52:45.419
Fuck.

52:46.253 --> 52:47.838
Dude, you got the--

52:47.838 --> 52:49.714
- Oh, yeah. They're temporary.
- Yeah?

52:49.714 --> 52:50.966
- Temporary?
- Yeah.

52:51.591 --> 52:52.759
They look cool.

52:53.343 --> 52:57.431
So, Liz make you stay and watch them
in case they wake up?

53:00.267 --> 53:03.311
Don't, don't.

53:03.311 --> 53:04.771
You don't want that shit in your head.

53:04.771 --> 53:06.273
Seriously, Leah.

53:07.274 --> 53:08.984
What happened to you?

53:08.984 --> 53:10.902
Fuck, Prior!

53:13.196 --> 53:15.157
He's an animal.

53:15.157 --> 53:18.118
Yeah, well,
he was raised by an animal

53:18.118 --> 53:20.203
- to be an animal, so.
- Doesn't matter.

53:20.203 --> 53:25.333
I mean, you come from the same shit
and you manage to be nice.

53:26.376 --> 53:28.420
Fucking dork,

53:28.420 --> 53:30.630
- but nice.
- A dork?

53:30.630 --> 53:33.175
- Yeah, you're a dork.
- Really? A dork? Ah, you're a dork.

53:38.972 --> 53:44.644
You know, my dad and Liz
used to dance to this all the time.

53:45.020 --> 53:46.438
- What?
- Yeah.

53:46.438 --> 53:47.564
Nah.

53:47.564 --> 53:49.649
- No way.
- Yeah.

53:49.649 --> 53:56.156
<i>My dad was, like, a stoner,
a wannabe artist, and he was so chill,</i>

53:56.156 --> 54:00.243
<i>and they used to love to dance together.</i>

54:01.369 --> 54:04.372
I'm pretty sure that Liz smoked weed too.

54:04.372 --> 54:06.208
Nah.

54:06.208 --> 54:09.294
- Nah, come on. Fuck.
- I'm so serious.

54:09.294 --> 54:12.923
- Can you imagine?
- No. I don't wanna.

54:16.134 --> 54:17.219
Ya know, Hank

54:18.428 --> 54:19.846
was a musician?

54:20.305 --> 54:21.223
What?

54:23.225 --> 54:24.810
Yeah, he played the guitar.

54:24.810 --> 54:26.061
- No.
- In a band.

54:26.061 --> 54:27.562
- No.
- Yeah.

54:27.562 --> 54:29.815
Well, was he any good?

54:29.815 --> 54:31.400
I don't know.

54:32.734 --> 54:36.154
I've actually never heard him play.

54:36.738 --> 54:37.823
Yeah, not once.

54:39.324 --> 54:43.662
My mom said he wasn't good enough
to have a career, but

54:44.579 --> 54:47.791
she kinda felt he wasn't--

54:47.791 --> 54:49.626
Good enough, period.

54:49.626 --> 54:50.919
Yeah.

54:51.545 --> 54:53.547
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:54.172 --> 54:56.174
That sticks with you, doesn't it?

54:56.800 --> 54:57.926
Not being good enough.

55:34.755 --> 55:38.049
Fuck, Gee, you said you weren't coming!

55:38.049 --> 55:39.760
Hey, Qavvik.

55:40.385 --> 55:42.804
You could've given me a heart attack.

55:43.555 --> 55:46.433
Changed my mind.
Wanna fuck?

55:50.187 --> 55:51.605
You jerked off.

55:52.230 --> 55:54.524
- Watching porn?
- No, I was-- I'm just--

55:54.524 --> 55:55.692
What kind of porn were you watching?

55:58.278 --> 56:01.406
Can we just, like, watch a movie and...

56:01.990 --> 56:03.200
Porn movie?

56:03.200 --> 56:04.826
Get out. I'm getting dressed.

56:08.955 --> 56:11.333
<i>And now she wants me on the case,</i>

56:11.333 --> 56:13.251
but I don't have anything.

56:14.252 --> 56:16.505
That can't be true.

56:16.505 --> 56:17.923
If you didn't have anything,

56:17.923 --> 56:20.467
she wouldn't want you,
so you have it all.

56:21.760 --> 56:24.221
Yeah. I mean,
I know everything about Annie,

56:24.221 --> 56:26.014
every single detail.

56:26.014 --> 56:29.184
But somehow,
I had no idea about the Clark thing.

56:29.184 --> 56:32.354
I mean, they kept it a secret.

56:32.354 --> 56:33.647
Well, why?

56:35.315 --> 56:37.317
That's not the right question.

56:38.026 --> 56:39.027
What?

56:40.195 --> 56:42.155
That's what Danvers would say.

56:46.076 --> 56:48.286
The right question is--

56:51.832 --> 56:54.251
The right question is how.

56:56.586 --> 56:59.005
That's why he got the trailer.

57:00.048 --> 57:01.675
To keep it a secret.

57:02.884 --> 57:05.178
Fuck. Yes!

57:05.178 --> 57:08.473
Where do you keep a trailer
to fuck in secret?

57:10.767 --> 57:12.394
The Nook.

57:58.690 --> 58:00.650
Talk to me, Raymond Clark.

58:36.561 --> 58:39.147
- Danvers.
- <i>You have to see this.</i>

58:50.450 --> 58:51.660
Jesus.

59:00.752 --> 59:02.462
Are those bones?

59:02.462 --> 59:04.339
Yeah, animal.

59:04.339 --> 59:07.259
Seal, caribou.

59:09.386 --> 59:10.762
I think.

59:21.690 --> 59:22.899
How'd you find this place?

59:23.316 --> 59:26.862
My Spirit Animal showed me in a dream.
Remember?

59:36.455 --> 59:37.664
Hey.

59:38.290 --> 59:42.794
Yeah, that's her phone. I checked.

59:42.794 --> 59:44.671
It was not with her body.

01:00:05.859 --> 01:00:07.486
Holy fuck.

01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:23.794
- Danvers.
- <i>Chief.</i>

01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:25.754
<i>We have a problem.</i>

01:00:42.854 --> 01:00:44.064
Hey.

01:00:47.442 --> 01:00:49.653
It's only six of 'em. See?

01:00:52.155 --> 01:00:58.912
Jie, Merens, Molina, Kotov,

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:02.624
Mehta.

01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:10.507
Emerson.

01:01:13.385 --> 01:01:14.803
He's not here.

01:01:16.304 --> 01:01:17.931
Clark's not here.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.603
Maybe he got separated.

01:01:23.603 --> 01:01:25.897
No, he didn't.

01:01:27.566 --> 01:01:29.192
He's alive.

01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:31.903
He's out there.
