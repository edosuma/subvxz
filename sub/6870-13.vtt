00:01.398 --> 00:04.641
ARCHER: What do you mean, your water
broke?! LANA: What do you mean, what

00:04.761 --> 00:08.079
do I mean? I mean that! I'm going
into labor! CHERLENE: Wait. What?!

00:08.148 --> 00:11.050
LANA: I'm having a baby? CHERLENE: Gross!
ARCHER: Bu-But it's early.

00:11.184 --> 00:14.086
Is-is that early?! LANA: Like, ten
days, but... ARCHER: But that's bad.

00:14.221 --> 00:17.122
Is that bad?! LANA: Archer,
none of this is ideal!

00:17.257 --> 00:19.959
HOLLY: Hey! LANA & ARCHER: What?!
HOLLY: What the hell are you

00:20.093 --> 00:22.728
people doing in San Marcos in the first
place?! LANA: Selling weapons to

00:22.862 --> 00:25.965
Calderón! ARCHER: That we got from him!
HOLLY: What?!

00:26.099 --> 00:28.701
SLATER: What? HOLLY: <i> What</i> what? You
didn't think that was something I'd

00:28.835 --> 00:31.503
like to know about?! SLATER: I'm
positive we talked about this.

00:31.638 --> 00:34.359
HOLLY: No, we didn't! SLATER: 100%
positive. HOLLY: When?! When did we

00:34.407 --> 00:37.309
talk about this?! SLATER: 80% positive.
LANA: Wait a minute.

00:37.444 --> 00:40.779
If the CIA is backing the
rebels against Calder... Ohhh!

00:40.914 --> 00:44.316
ARCHER: Lana! Was that a contraction?!
LANA: Yup. Ohh!

00:44.451 --> 00:47.786
God, I hope so. Yup. ARCHER: Time!
Start a clock, assholes!

00:47.921 --> 00:51.490
SLATER: Uh, okay. Mark!
(beep) CHERLENE: Twain!

00:51.625 --> 00:54.793
No, that's barges. LANA: Shut up!
(groans)

00:54.928 --> 00:58.163
But, hey, speaking of time...
ARCHER: What's your Bishop Score?!

00:58.298 --> 01:01.138
LANA: How should I...? Wait. How do
you even know what a Bishop Score is?

01:01.234 --> 01:04.269
ARCHER: I got certified as a doula,
which, turns out, is not that hard.

01:04.404 --> 01:07.525
LANA: Shut up. Does the CIA know Calderón
has a nerve gas missile at the palace?

01:07.574 --> 01:10.776
ARCHER: What?! CHERLENE: Cool.
HOLLY: We didn't give him

01:10.910 --> 01:14.113
gas! LANA: Well, he's got it, and
we can't override the launch

01:14.247 --> 01:17.149
sequence, so we've... HOLLY: Get
that idiot Calderón on the phone!

01:17.284 --> 01:20.052
ARCHER: Oh, did I mention, a tiger ate him?
HOLLY: What?!

01:20.186 --> 01:22.721
SLATER: Wait. What?! CHERLENE: Well,
not <i> ate</i> ate. ARCHER: Well, no, but by

01:22.856 --> 01:25.758
now... HOLLY: Jesus God.
Okay, Slater, I know it's a

01:25.892 --> 01:28.761
little sooner than we wanted, but...
SLATER: Operation Dropkick.

01:28.895 --> 01:32.131
Roger that. LANA: What's
Operation Dropkick?

01:32.265 --> 01:35.034
HOLLY: Well, the endgame has always
been for us to invade San Marcos, so...

01:35.168 --> 01:38.037
SLATER: Hey, Donna, we got a
carrier group in the Gulf, right?

01:38.171 --> 01:40.739
LANA: Wait. If you were going to invade San
Marcos, then why have you been selling weapons to

01:40.874 --> 01:44.143
Calderón? HOLLY: So he
could fight the rebels.

01:44.277 --> 01:46.679
LANA: Which is you. HOLLY: Well,
technically, they're mercenaries from

01:46.813 --> 01:49.815
Honduras and Guatemala, but yes. LANA:
Okay, so, am I just stupid, or...?

01:49.949 --> 01:53.352
CHERLENE: Duh. Pregnant. SLATER: Yeah,
airstrike, naval bombardment, amphibious

01:53.486 --> 01:56.822
landing, whole megillah. HOLLY: Calderón
needed weapons to fight the rebels, but

01:56.956 --> 02:00.292
he didn't have money to buy weapons.
He only had cocaine, but Iran

02:00.427 --> 02:03.629
was like, "No way. Cash only." So...
ARCHER & LANA: Iran?!

02:03.763 --> 02:07.299
HOLLY: Ooh, sorry. Iraq. Wait. No, Iran.
No, doesn't matter who.

02:07.434 --> 02:10.769
Anyway, to buy the weapons, we needed to...
monetize the cocaine.

02:10.904 --> 02:14.306
(Lana gasps) LANA: Oh, my God.
ARCHER: Join the club.

02:14.441 --> 02:17.676
We've been trying to monetize cocaine
for, like... I mean, you even came to the

02:17.811 --> 02:22.548
house, where we... We've been selling
cocaine for the CIA so they could buy arms

02:22.682 --> 02:26.819
from Iran?! Did we at least
free some hostages?!

02:26.953 --> 02:30.522
HOLLY: No, this was about our annual
budget. ARCHER & LANA: What?!

02:30.657 --> 02:33.537
HOLLY: If we don't spend it this year,
we can't get an increase next year.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.829
ARCHER: You son of a... HOLLY: Oh,
come on, Archer. Drop the act!

02:36.963 --> 02:40.532
He was in on it from day one.
ARCHER & LANA: What?! (Lana growls)

02:40.667 --> 02:44.440

and laughs) (Archer chokes)

(Archer gasps, mutters)

03:26.234 --> 03:29.803
LANA: You knew about this the entire time?!
ARCHER: No, no.

03:29.938 --> 03:33.340
(Archer choking) (Cherlene
squeals) SLATER: Hey, do you mind?

03:33.475 --> 03:36.677
I'm trying to call in an air strike here.
HOLLY: Ooh, hey, what's our ride situation?

03:36.811 --> 03:38.344
SLATER: Hang on.
Thanks, doll.

03:38.464 --> 03:42.638
Air strike on the palace is a go, and
I suggest we take Calderón's jet.

03:42.772 --> 03:46.375
HOLLY: Good. Yeah, we need plenty of room...
until we dump them at a black site.

03:46.495 --> 03:48.510
ARCHER: What the f... (Archer gasps,
coughs) HOLLY: Come on, even if you

03:48.645 --> 03:52.835
people hadn't lost 50 million bucks worth
of our cocaine, you know way too much.

03:52.955 --> 03:56.257
CHERLENE: Uh, I don't know anything!
HOLLY: I believe that to be

03:56.392 --> 04:01.296
literally true. <i>Oye, muchachos!
Agarrenlos!</i>

04:01.430 --> 04:06.234

We give up. HOLLY: Whoa! Whoa! Come on.

04:09.371 --> 04:12.740
SLATER: Don't shoot! (Lana
sighs) LANA: Now then.

04:12.875 --> 04:16.411
Let's get this baby out of me.
CHERLENE: Gross! LANA: Will you sh...

04:16.545 --> 04:20.380
(Lana groans loudly) ARCHER (weakly):
Time?! SLATER: Nine minutes!

04:20.516 --> 04:23.885
What? This is exciting. KRIEGER: Right?
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:

04:24.019 --> 04:27.589
Minutes to launch-- 60. RAY: Yeah, Krieger,
I guess trying to defuse a warhead

04:27.723 --> 04:32.060
tipped with deadly nerve gas <i> is</i> technically
exciting. KRIEGER: Yeah, right?

04:32.194 --> 04:35.763
RAY: What is wrong with you?
KRIEGER: Nothin', Roy. RAY: Or Ray.

04:35.898 --> 04:39.434
KRIEGER: Eh. Doesn't matter who.
CYRIL: Krieger!

04:39.568 --> 04:42.670
(Krieger and Ray gasp) CYRIL:
Where are we on the missile?!

04:42.805 --> 04:45.974
KRIEGER: Uh, kind of just like... on it.
Oh, do you mean where are we in

04:46.108 --> 04:49.644
the process of disarming it? Ooh!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (Cyril sighs)

04:49.778 --> 04:52.981
Ow! Come on. Ow! Ow! CYRIL: Okay.
MALORY: What happened?!

04:53.115 --> 04:56.417
Did it explode?! CYRIL: Uh, no.
I think we would've heard it.

04:56.552 --> 04:59.554
MALORY: Well, it's just a matter of time before
it does, with those idiots working on it!

04:59.688 --> 05:03.024
We need to leave! CYRIL: Well, A:
I'm president for life, so I'm not

05:03.158 --> 05:07.028
going anywhere, and B... COMANDANTE: Señor
Presidente! Our radar station has detected

05:07.162 --> 05:10.732
incoming bombers! From their
heading, they appear... American!

05:10.866 --> 05:14.402
(Malory gasps) (Cyril clears
his throat) CYRIL: And B...

05:14.536 --> 05:17.936
COMANDANTE: And I hate to tell you this, but
the First Lady and I are having an affair.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.576
(Cyril sniffles) CYRIL: Damn, dawg.
That was my B.

05:21.710 --> 05:26.514
JULIANA: It's over, Cyril. It's over!
CYRIL: Nothing is over!

05:26.649 --> 05:30.018
Nothing! You don't just turn it off!
It wasn't my war!

05:30.152 --> 05:33.721
You asked me. I didn't ask you!
And I did what I had to do to

05:33.856 --> 05:37.392
win! But somebody
wouldn't let us win!

05:37.526 --> 05:40.895
MALORY: Yes, and that somebody is a U.S.
Navy carrier group, so let's go already!

05:41.030 --> 05:44.565
(Cyril sniffles) CYRIL:
Okay, but I'm taking these.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.069
MALORY (laughing): Oh, we're taking
everything! Furs, jewels, the silverware,

05:48.203 --> 05:51.739
bullion, anything you can cram in a
suitcase! PAM: Mm, mm. Wouldn't bullion

05:51.874 --> 05:56.377
leak out of a...? Ow! Ow! Cut it...
Ow, goddamn it!

05:56.512 --> 05:59.881
I... Ow! MALORY: Gold
bullion, you idiot!

06:00.015 --> 06:03.418
PAM: I don't know what that is!
JULIANA: And I don't know who

06:03.552 --> 06:06.754
you think you are! You are not robbing
my palace! MALORY: Oh, yes, we are, and

06:06.889 --> 06:11.492
if you've got any sense, you'll fill your
pockets, too! Because your regime is

06:11.627 --> 06:16.931
officially over. And I've seen coups from
Angola to Zanzibar, and this is how it

06:17.066 --> 06:20.635
ends: in the trunk of a taxi to the airport,
your belly full of diamonds and vodka,

06:20.769 --> 06:26.107
praying your driver doesn't rat you out
to the Reds at the last checkpoint.

06:26.241 --> 06:30.378
Because then, the last thing you'll ever hear,
besides a pistol cocking behind your head,

06:30.512 --> 06:37.418
is Ivan's laugh-- (Pam cackling)
MALORY: What... in the name

06:37.553 --> 06:40.955
of God... is funny?! PAM (laughing):
You said you've seen cooze.

06:41.090 --> 06:46.561
(Pam clears her throat) Appropes.
(Pam grunts)

REBEL SOLDIER 1: <i> Vamonos! Los Americanos
vienen!</i> REBEL SOLDIERS: <i> Corre!</i>

06:50.265 --> 06:53.501
<i>Corre! Corre!</i> REBEL SOLDIER 2: <i> Espere!
Espere! Esp--</i> wughh!

06:53.635 --> 06:57.572
CHERLENE: Aww... All the
gardeners are running away.

06:57.706 --> 07:01.042
HOLLY: Because this entire country's about
to be up to its tits in U.S. Marines.

07:01.176 --> 07:04.946
SLATER: And unless you people want to wind
up classified as enemy combatants, you...

07:05.080 --> 07:09.884
(gunfire) ARCHER: Six minutes!
Doing great, buddy.

07:10.018 --> 07:13.087
Got to remember to breathe, though. That's
the... LANA: Oh, get out, you lying

07:13.222 --> 07:17.024
sack of bastard! ARCHER: Okay, A: He
and Mother are the lying sacks of

07:17.159 --> 07:20.428
bastard. I didn't know it
was the CIA's cocaine.

07:20.562 --> 07:24.932
And B: Seriously, buddy, let's try and work on
that breathing. CHERLENE: What's wrong with

07:25.067 --> 07:29.737
her? ARCHER: Wha...?
She's having a baby!

07:29.872 --> 07:34.142
CHERLENE: Gross.
(Cherlene slurping)

07:36.290 --> 07:40.665
(Lana breathing rapidly) ARCHER:
Doing good, buddy. LANA: Archer!

07:40.785 --> 07:45.133
If you call me buddy again, I will put
the bullets in your body by hand!

07:45.253 --> 07:48.868
ARCHER: Shh, and we're breathing...
(both breathe deeply)

07:49.003 --> 07:53.302
LANA (exhaling): Ooh... ARCHER:
There we go. Okay, Carol!

07:53.422 --> 07:57.739
(Cherlene slurps) CHERLENE: What?
Jesus! What is your problem!

07:57.859 --> 08:02.296
LANA: Morphine, want, find, give!
ARCHER: Shh. Come on, Lana,

08:02.416 --> 08:05.285
you don't need that. LANA (gasps):
How dare you tell me what I...

08:05.419 --> 08:08.421
ARCHER: Shut up. Okay, Carol, I need
you to look down there and give me a

08:08.556 --> 08:11.424
sit-rep. CHERLENE: Down where?
ARCHER: There, down there, at

08:11.559 --> 08:15.095
her, um... CHERLENE: Ew! No! You do it!
SLATER: I'll do it!

08:15.229 --> 08:18.798
ARCHER: Shut up. I can't look down there
because there's, like, a hundred percent

08:18.933 --> 08:21.801
chance that at some point in the
future we're gonna have sex, so...

08:21.936 --> 08:24.804
LANA: Who?! ARCHER: Shh. So
just look down there and...

08:24.939 --> 08:30.410
CHERLENE: I'm not looking at her goddamn
va... Joinks! Well, you don't need to shave.

08:30.544 --> 08:35.315
(laughs) That thing is smooth.
LANA: I...! Thank you.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.551
CHERLENE: And also kind of mauve.
LANA (sighs): Okay.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.388
SLATER: Eh, I'd say more
of a mauve-taupe? Ow!

08:42.523 --> 08:45.959
HOLLY: Ow! (Lana grunting
loudly) ARCHER: Breathe, bu...

08:46.093 --> 08:49.796
breathe, friend. Because, uh...
Wow. Okay.

08:49.930 --> 08:54.467
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Minutes to launch... six...

08:54.602 --> 08:59.239
(Gillette yells) (Krieger
screaming) GILLETTE: Where the...

08:59.373 --> 09:03.443
(approaching footsteps, screaming
continues) KRIEGER (panting): Okay...

09:03.577 --> 09:07.247
I have some thoughts on this.
GILLETTE: Really? KRIEGER: Yes.

09:07.381 --> 09:10.884
GILLETTE: Which are...?! KRIEGER: Oh. Okay.
So, I don't think we can disarm

09:11.018 --> 09:14.854
this thing. GILLETTE: Really?
KRIEGER: Yes.

09:14.989 --> 09:19.225
Oh. Okay. So, it doesn't have an explosive
payload, so it's basically just a flying

09:19.360 --> 09:22.495
trash can. The only dangerous
part is the nerve gas.

09:22.630 --> 09:26.065
(jet engines whooshing) GILLETTE: I'm
listening. COPILOT (over radio): Roger

09:26.200 --> 09:32.305
that, flight deck. Um... PILOT:
Range-- 150. ETA-- 12 minutes.

09:35.543 --> 09:39.946
COPILOT: Hey, is your dad still
big into tapas? PILOT: My what?

09:40.080 --> 09:47.987
Oh, no, that wasn't my dad. COPILOT: Well,
who was it? PILOT: Doesn't matter who.

09:48.122 --> 09:51.191
PAM: Because these trunks feel light.
Do you swear they're full of

09:51.325 --> 09:54.460
cocaine? MALORY: As God...
is my witness.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.330
PAM: God hates you. Open 'em up.
MALORY: Wha...?

09:57.464 --> 10:00.934
(horn honking) CYRIL: Will you
two come on?! PAM: On what?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.937
MALORY: Ugh! CYRIL: Do you hear that?
(jets whooshing)

10:04.071 --> 10:07.574
MALORY (gasps): If we get out of here
alive, I'll buy you all new cocaine.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.577
And a pony! PAM: You heard her,
Cyril-- that is legally binding.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.680
CYRIL: Yeah, we'll stop at a notary.
MALORY: There's no time!

10:13.814 --> 10:18.952
SLATER: Hey. Hi! Do you people hear that?
HOLLY: After the air strike

10:19.086 --> 10:22.121
on the palace, you won't be able to swing a
dead cat around here without hitting a Marine.

10:22.256 --> 10:26.292
CHERLENE: Plus, if you did, I bet they'd
smash your teeth down your stupid throat.

10:26.427 --> 10:30.330
ARCHER: Okay, uh... Lana, I
need to borrow your weapon.

10:30.464 --> 10:35.101
LANA: No! I will see you in Hell first.
ARCHER: I... Okay, Carol,

10:35.236 --> 10:38.538
grab that one. (cocks weapon)
CHERLENE: Private Me,

10:38.672 --> 10:42.342
reporting for sploosh. ARCHER (groans):
Take Tweedledick and Tweedleballs, go

10:42.476 --> 10:47.247
get the jet ready for takeoff... CHERLENE:
Outlaw country! ARCHER: Let me finish!

10:47.381 --> 10:50.550
CHERLENE: What?! ARCHER: <i> And
</i> make sure they don't escape.

10:50.684 --> 10:56.189
CHERLENE: Oh, my God, good thing you added
that last part. You heard the doula-- move it!

10:56.323 --> 10:59.492
LANA: And get me some frickin' morphine!
ARCHER: Lana, come on, what

10:59.627 --> 11:02.996
kind of doula would I be if I let
you have more... (rifle clicks)

11:03.130 --> 11:05.999
ARCHER: Wha...? (Lana
grunting loudly) ARCHER: Wow.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.602
LANA: And some ammo! ARCHER (chuckling):
You were really gonna shoot me in the

11:09.737 --> 11:14.240
face? LANA (sniffles):
Is that so much to ask?

11:14.375 --> 11:20.146
COPILOT: Uncle. Uh, friend of the family.
PILOT: Dude. Drop it.

11:23.183 --> 11:27.787
(classical piano music playing) COMANDANTE:
We should get to the shelter soon.

11:27.922 --> 11:32.191
JULIANA: You coward. COMANDANTE: Wha...?
JULIANA: I've never loved

11:32.326 --> 11:38.064
you. (Comandante sighs)

MALORY: If...

11:41.335 --> 11:44.537
PAM: Yeah, and then drag him out of the car
and kneel him down and shoot him in the back

11:44.672 --> 11:50.009
of the head and string him up on a lamppost
like Mussolini! CYRIL: Yeah. What then?

11:50.144 --> 11:54.147
MALORY: That's a chance I'm
willing to take. PAM: Me too.

right, Lana, so you can look in the mirror

13:23.147 --> 13:25.982
and see if you're crowning. LANA: What?!
MALORY: For the love of

all right. Here.

Long story.

13:50.741 --> 13:53.709

What did y'all have?

13:53.844 --> 13:56.764
CYRIL: (groans) I wasn't in the sperm
donor pool. RAY: Phra... Wait, are we

13:56.847 --> 13:59.715
still doing phrasing? KRIEGER: Huh.
Should I be in there?

13:59.850 --> 14:03.719
I feel like I should. I mean, I am a
doctor. RAY & CYRIL: No, you're not.

14:14.832 --> 14:18.434
Jesus, I feel so helpless out here!
What if something goes wrong?

14:18.569 --> 14:21.437
What-what if there's a-a birth defect or...
LANA: (grunts) No. No, no,

14:21.572 --> 14:24.440

aren't enough hands and feet?

14:24.575 --> 14:27.977
MALORY: Shh, it's going to... LANA: Oh, my
God, what if there are too many hands and

14:28.111 --> 14:31.414
feet? Is that worse, or... PAM: Hey!
I have the correct

14:31.548 --> 14:34.749
number of hands, but they're currently kind
of full and you need a slappin', so...

14:34.818 --> 14:38.821
LANA: Wait... (gasps) MALORY: Oh, please.
Like you're the only one who

14:38.956 --> 14:42.458

You know... PAM: Okay, okay, okay.

LANA (dreamily): Mmm, yeah.

15:30.774 --> 15:36.746
Oh, and, uh, I quit. MALORY: Wha... Why?
LANA: Because you lying to me

15:36.880 --> 15:41.918
I can handle-- I'm used to that-- but...
(sighs) not Archer.

15:42.052 --> 15:46.756
MALORY: Oh, for... He didn't know that I
made a deal to sell cocaine for the CIA.

15:46.890 --> 15:51.894
LANA: (scoffs) Whatever. MALORY: Lana Kane,
you have known me for a long, long time.

15:52.029 --> 15:57.600
When have I ever been honest
with Sterling? LANA: Huh.

15:57.734 --> 16:03.072
MALORY: Exactly. Now, if you two will
excuse me, I need to go threaten and/or

16:03.206 --> 16:08.578
bribe some federal agents. Well,
at least put a seatbelt on it!

16:08.712 --> 16:11.647
ARCHER: See? What'd I tell you!
KRIEGER: I thought it was

16:11.782 --> 16:14.984
just for takeoff and landing! MALORY:
Jesus Christ. ARCHER: So, um, how's she

16:15.118 --> 16:18.870
doing? MALORY: She's fine.
I told her you didn't know

16:18.990 --> 16:20.694
anything about the CIA deal.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.850
Well thanks for telling the truth, Mother--
sure that was hard for you.

16:23.970 --> 16:27.093
MALORY: You keep it up, mister, and I'll walk
right back in there and tell her the whole

16:27.228 --> 16:30.530
thing was your idea.
ARCHER: Did you guys hear that?

16:30.665 --> 16:33.800
OTHERS: No. ARCHER: Dicks.
MALORY: All right, Holly,

16:33.935 --> 16:37.504
this is my offer and it is nonnegotiable...
PAM: (gasps) You think she's

16:37.638 --> 16:41.474
buying more coke? CHERLENE: (groans)
You and your stupid, stupid cocaine!

16:41.609 --> 16:45.045
Can't you give her a brain chip?
KRIEGER: A what? CYRIL: A brain chip.

16:45.179 --> 16:49.049
Like you gave Cherlene so she could become a
country singer. KRIEGER: Oh, no, that wasn't

16:49.183 --> 16:52.586
a brain chip. It was just the sticker
off the backpack of a little Lego

16:52.720 --> 16:55.589
spaceman. PAM: What?
CYRIL: A Lego sticker?

16:55.723 --> 17:00.827
CHERLENE: Whoa. So my whole life, all I
ever had to do was believe in myself?

17:00.962 --> 17:04.964
And inject a sticker into my brain?
HOLLY: Are you out of your

17:05.098 --> 17:08.501
mind? MALORY: Are you?
Showing up at the mansion,

17:08.636 --> 17:11.605
pretending to search for the cocaine?
HOLLY: While planting the

17:11.739 --> 17:15.241
seed in your idiot son's brain about selling
it overseas. MALORY: Which I could have

17:15.376 --> 17:19.512
handled if the CIA had kept its fat
nose out! HOLLY: And yet here we are,

17:19.646 --> 17:22.915
with a $50 million hole in our account.
MALORY: There's 40 of it.

17:23.050 --> 17:27.814
An original Ivan Blitko we stole
from Calderón. HOLLY: What am I su

17:27.948 --> 17:31.651
MALORY: Gosh, I don't know. What am I
supposed to do with a canister of nerve gas?

17:31.785 --> 17:35.755
HOLLY: No, uh-uh. That is now CIA property.
MALORY: Ooh, and won't that

17:35.889 --> 17:40.560
be a feather in your cap. They
might even make you director.

17:40.694 --> 17:44.497
HOLLY: Hmm... or at least Deputy Ops.
MALORY: Which-- and I'm just

17:44.631 --> 17:50.069
spitballing here-- would mean you could outsource
a good deal of business to a private firm.

17:50.204 --> 17:54.073
(Malory slurps) Like ISIS.
HOLLY: So you lose us $50

17:54.208 --> 17:58.611
million <i> and</i> you want to get on the
CIA payroll? MALORY: Right after you

17:58.745 --> 18:01.981
renovate my offices. HOLLY: Ha!
You really are out of your mind.

18:02.115 --> 18:06.052
MALORY: Or right after I take this
deal to your partner in the cockpit...

18:06.186 --> 18:15.228
RAY: So, what's your deal? SLATER:
What's my deal? RAY: Never mind.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.231
MALORY: Because you suddenly decided
to take up skydiving. (cocks gun)

18:19.833 --> 18:22.602
HOLLY: I think we may have a deal here.
(knocking)

18:22.736 --> 18:26.005
ARCHER: Knock, knock. LANA: Who's there?
ARCHER: Shit, I-I had

18:26.139 --> 18:29.609
something for this. LANA: (sighs)
Come see the baby, stupid.

18:29.743 --> 18:35.081
ARCHER: Wow. LANA: Yeah.
ARCHER: Wow.

18:35.215 --> 18:41.187
LANA: (sighs) Yeah. ARCHER: I-I had black
guy. LANA: Yeah. So, about that...

18:41.321 --> 18:44.190
ARCHER: I don't think it's racist,
it's just that I thought...

18:44.324 --> 18:46.559
LANA: Archer, shut up. ARCHER:
(chuckles) You shut up.

18:46.693 --> 18:50.696
LANA: Archer... (clears throat) Okay,
so, remember when you had cancer?

18:50.831 --> 18:54.867
ARCHER: (chuckles) Um, uh, vaguely.
LANA: (sighs) Okay.

18:55.002 --> 18:58.604
Well, we all thought you were gonna die.
And one night you got really

18:58.739 --> 19:03.776
drunk and we almost had sex and, right before you
passed out, you told me Malory had convinced you

19:03.911 --> 19:07.813
to freeze a bunch of your sperm at Dr. Feldman's
office. And I was like, "Huh, weird."

19:07.948 --> 19:11.150
(high-pitched ringing) And then you didn't
die, and then a few years went by and I

19:11.285 --> 19:14.687
started thinking about having a baby, but I
was single. And all the other stuff aside,

19:14.821 --> 19:17.957
physically, you're an amazing human being.
And all the other other stuff

19:18.091 --> 19:22.161
aside, I do actually love you. (muffled): And
so here's this viable sample just sitting there

19:22.296 --> 19:26.799
at Dr. Feldman's, whose security system is a
joke, by the way. And so I guess it maybe wasn't

19:26.934 --> 19:34.843
the most ethical thing I've ever done in
my entire life, but... (echoing): Archer?

19:34.978 --> 19:41.950
Archer. Archer...
ARCHER: Wuzzat?!

19:42.085 --> 19:47.222
Wait, wait, huh, huh? What? LANA: You okay?
ARCHER: (exhales) Yeah.

19:47.357 --> 19:51.117
Sorry. For a second, I-I thought I was just now
coming out of a coma from when I drowned, saving

19:51.194 --> 19:56.865
your life eight months ago. (Archer
sighs) Lana, am I just now coming out

19:57.000 --> 19:59.868
of a coma from when I drowned
saving your life eight months ago?

20:00.003 --> 20:06.008
LANA: No. ARCHER: Hmm. Lana,
am I just <i> now</i> coming out

20:06.142 --> 20:09.344
of a coma from when I drowned,
saving your life eight months ago?

20:09.479 --> 20:13.815
LANA: No. ARCHER: Then what are you...
Baby, what is she saying?

20:13.950 --> 20:18.954
Baby? Baby. Baby!

20:19.088 --> 20:26.361
(baby cooing) ARCHER: M-meep.
LANA: Sterling Archer, I'd

20:26.496 --> 20:32.267
like you to meet your daughter, Abbiejean.
