WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.699
Previously onLegacies...I did black magic.

00:03.742 --> 00:05.222
VARDEMUS:
This is a Mora Miserium,

00:05.266 --> 00:06.397
the tool used to withhold

00:06.441 --> 00:08.443
the ill effects of such magic.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.227
So long as it doesn't shatter.

00:10.271 --> 00:12.534
We drop it in a place
where magic can't escape.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.231
The prison world.Absolutely not.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.103
He's not gonna let us anywhere
near that prison world

00:16.146 --> 00:18.105
with our psychotic uncle Kai. Bonnie! Bonnie!

00:18.148 --> 00:20.194
Then what if we sent it
to a different one?

00:20.237 --> 00:22.152
Make a new world
with a new ascendant

00:22.196 --> 00:23.762
and no homicidal uncles.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.242
ALYSSA:
And then, when everyone else

00:25.286 --> 00:26.635
was basking in Coven Day bliss,

00:26.678 --> 00:28.463
I linked the two ascendants.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.424
EMMA:
What did you do, Alyssa?

00:33.468 --> 00:35.992
I sent them away.
Just like you sent the others.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.255
You kicked Sebastian out, right?He chose to leave.

00:38.299 --> 00:40.649
Dad, where are we?

00:40.692 --> 00:42.433
Prison world. It's the one
you made when you were kids.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.696
Hello, Elizabeth.

00:44.740 --> 00:45.741
Sebastian.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.365
Five total.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.454
Yeah, somebody fed on them.

01:03.498 --> 01:05.195
Burned the bodies
to cover it up.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.112
DORIAN:
It might not be
one of ours.

01:27.043 --> 01:31.091
Ric, what are we gonna do?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.322
LIZZIE:
You lied to me?

01:45.366 --> 01:48.760
You told me that Sebastian
chose to leave the school.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.328
I said he made his choice.
He refused to respect our rules.

01:51.372 --> 01:54.026
So you sent him here?

01:54.070 --> 01:55.985
SEBASTIAN: He had help.
There was a witch

01:56.028 --> 01:56.986
who did the spell.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.509
Dark hair, kind eyes.

01:58.553 --> 01:59.771
Amazing accent.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.251
Emma.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.166
How could you, Dad?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.863
You can yell at me
after we arm ourselves.

02:04.907 --> 02:07.344
Dad, why do we need
weapons so bad?

02:07.388 --> 02:09.172
All you need to know is that
we're in danger,

02:09.216 --> 02:11.218
and we need to find
a way out now.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.395
We're in a new world now.

02:14.438 --> 02:17.311
Perhaps you are no longer
the one in charge.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.235
To be clear,
my daughters and I are leaving,

02:28.278 --> 02:32.717
you are staying behind
and yes, I am in charge.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.723
Oh, my God.

02:43.337 --> 02:46.340
Dad. This is about Uncle Kai,
isn't it?

02:46.383 --> 02:47.863
That's why you're so worried?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.430
I know this has
to be hard for you,

02:49.473 --> 02:51.258
but you said he was desiccated.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.911
You don't know
what he's capable of.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.435
And until I'm positive
no one's set him free,

02:54.478 --> 02:55.566
I'm not taking any chances.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.394
Dad, who could have
set him free?

02:59.266 --> 03:00.919
I'll explain all that later.

03:00.963 --> 03:03.661
Right now, I need you
to go to the meadow

03:03.705 --> 03:05.315
and get the Sandclock
before anyone else finds it.

03:07.491 --> 03:10.451
Then I need you to come back
here and hide.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.279
And stay hidden.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.895
Dad, this is
all my fault.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.897
If I hadn't done black magic
in the first place,

03:21.940 --> 03:23.377
we'd have never
been in this mess.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.337
We all make mistakes.

03:35.345 --> 03:39.088
I-I can't believe
that this is happening.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.090
I'm so sorry, Sebastian.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.875
You are not responsible
for your father's overreactions.

03:43.919 --> 03:47.052
What did you do to
upset him so much?

03:47.096 --> 03:49.229
He wanted to keep me
away from you.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.495
I'm glad you're here.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.670
Circumstances aside.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.281
But we should not stay here.Don't worry.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.066
When we find a way out of here,
you're coming with us.

04:03.112 --> 04:07.725
You... you misunderstand me.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.988
I meant this house.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.338
This town.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.079
There's a whole world
out there, Elizabeth.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.866
We have an entire planet
to ourselves.

04:17.909 --> 04:21.565
So come with me
and experience it.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.611
Just for one day.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.788
Hmm?

04:26.831 --> 04:29.965
We can't. My dad said...

04:30.008 --> 04:32.272
He lied to you. Again.
Trust me...

04:34.404 --> 04:36.319
...there is no one else here.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.936
♪ This one got
a princely racket ♪

04:44.980 --> 04:46.895
♪ That's what I said now

05:34.464 --> 05:37.206
Lizzie?

05:37.249 --> 05:38.990
Sebastian?

05:40.078 --> 05:42.080
Where are you guys?

05:44.126 --> 05:46.346
Quick question.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.698
Who the hell are you?

05:51.786 --> 05:53.788
Jade?

06:00.098 --> 06:01.404
JADE:
Knock it off, Wendy.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.579
You're gonna burn
the place down.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.102
Okay, Warden.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.453
You're just upset you can't
go to your Muggle party.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.280
Yeah, well, I told Inez
I was gonna be there,

06:08.324 --> 06:10.326
and now she's gonna think
that I flaked on her.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.286
Yep, the barrier spell
is still up.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.201
Thanks for checking, though.DIEGO:
I hate being locked up.

06:16.245 --> 06:20.467
Yeah, well, in case you didn't
notice, I got issues, too.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.469
And being stuck in detention
with an edgy werewolf

06:22.512 --> 06:24.253
is triggering 'em.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.646
You know, we wouldn't
even be here

06:25.689 --> 06:27.822
if you could just
control yourself.

06:27.865 --> 06:28.997
DIEGO:
It's not me.
It's the turn.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.085
When the full
moon's coming,

06:30.128 --> 06:33.610
something just happens to me.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.091
You mean, like,
you become a wolf?

06:36.134 --> 06:37.484
Oh, screw you.

06:37.527 --> 06:38.876
You got no idea
what it feels like,

06:38.920 --> 06:40.617
to feel every bone
in your body break.

06:40.661 --> 06:44.839
It's worse than any pain
you've ever felt.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.624
Okay, you've convinced me.

06:47.668 --> 06:50.714
Life is awful and unfair.
So relax.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.456
Detention's gonna last
as long as it lasts.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.066
Unless...

06:57.721 --> 06:59.288
Hey, Joze.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.465
Hi.What you doing?

07:02.509 --> 07:04.511
You spying on me?

07:04.554 --> 07:07.078
This is Diego and Wendy.

07:07.122 --> 07:08.471
She's the witch who does fire.

07:16.523 --> 07:19.526
Yeah, we're spelled in here.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.093
And now we're gonna miss
this really awesome party

07:22.137 --> 07:23.573
that we wanted to go to.

07:26.358 --> 07:29.187
Aren't you one of those
special siphon witches?

07:30.711 --> 07:32.930
I bet you could take
this barrier spell down

07:32.974 --> 07:34.584
with no problem.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.325
JADE:
No. No way.

07:36.368 --> 07:39.459
No, that's too hard. Only
advanced witches can do that.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.504
Mm.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.289
Unless... I mean,

07:44.333 --> 07:46.596
you think you could handle
a big girl spell like that.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.991
I'm not supposed to.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.732
No, it's all right.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.342
We'll go to the party
and then be back

07:53.385 --> 07:55.431
before anyone
even realizes we're gone.

07:56.824 --> 08:00.480
What do you say, Joze?
You one of us?

08:03.178 --> 08:05.528
Little Josie Saltzman
all grown-up.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.790
I'll be damned.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.619
Is Lizzie here, too?

08:09.663 --> 08:11.578
Uh, no.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.015
Jade, what are you doing here?

08:14.058 --> 08:15.799
If it's okay
with you, can we

08:15.843 --> 08:17.192
have this conversation

08:17.235 --> 08:18.715
after I eat?

08:18.759 --> 08:19.977
Because I'm starving,

08:20.021 --> 08:23.503
and you look delicious.

08:34.209 --> 08:37.212
Come with me
if you want to live.

08:41.608 --> 08:45.133
Welcome. I call it Fort Parker.

08:45.176 --> 08:48.179
It's a... it's a bit moldy
but also rent-controlled,

08:48.223 --> 08:49.659
so I try not to complain.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.749
Flavored vodka? It's, uh...

08:52.793 --> 08:56.187
: It's no Zima,
but then again, nothing is.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.584
You're Kai Parker.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.064
I am.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.675
And you are one of
the Saltzman twins.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.416
I can smell the Gemini on you.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.766
The real question is: are you

09:09.810 --> 09:12.203
Linda or, or Joanie?

09:12.247 --> 09:13.814
I can never tell you two apart.

09:13.857 --> 09:14.902
I'm Josie.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.252
Named after my mom,
who you killed.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.167
Okay, here we go.
Look, technically,

09:19.210 --> 09:22.387
I was trying to kill you
and your sister.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.389
Uh, but that's all over now,

09:24.433 --> 09:25.913
so I say we just move on.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.611
Move on?

09:28.655 --> 09:29.873
You're a monster.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.660
A monster would
have let you die.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.531
That vampire who
tried to turn you

09:35.575 --> 09:37.011
into her own
personal Capri Sun?

09:37.054 --> 09:38.621
She's the real monster.

09:38.665 --> 09:39.796
She and her cronies
run this world.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.406
They revived me from desiccation

09:41.450 --> 09:43.191
just so they could have
a little plaything.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.019
Every day, like clockwork,

09:45.062 --> 09:46.803
they hunt me down and kill me.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.676
But s... since I'm magically
bound to this world...

09:50.720 --> 09:52.069
...I can't actually die.

09:52.113 --> 09:55.246
So I pop back up
only to be hunted

09:55.290 --> 09:57.509
and killed all over again

09:57.553 --> 09:58.772
every day.

09:58.815 --> 10:02.123
Welcome to the
Supernatural Hunger Games.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.125
That girl used to go

10:04.168 --> 10:06.823
to my school. Why is she here?

10:06.867 --> 10:08.564
No answers for free.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.046
Information for information.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.918
What are you doing here?

10:14.962 --> 10:18.443
I, um... I used a Mora Miserium.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.749
Sandclock?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.882
Oh, don't tell me.
It degraded, and you

10:21.925 --> 10:23.492
just decided
to drop it over here

10:23.535 --> 10:25.668
without a thought for my safety.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.844
I tried to create a new world,
but a witch tricked us,

10:27.888 --> 10:29.672
and we got pulled
into this one instead.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.543
Classic double cross.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.806
And, uh...

10:32.849 --> 10:34.634
who's "we"?

10:35.896 --> 10:38.550
I answered your question.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.640
Now you have to answer mine.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.731
Why is Jade here?

10:44.774 --> 10:46.733
Yeah.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.170
I'm not the one
you should be asking.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.913
KAI :
Who is out there tonight, huh?

10:52.956 --> 10:54.784
Is that Damon? Bon-Bon?
Katherine?

10:54.828 --> 10:57.700
Well, whoever you are,
that one goes out

10:57.744 --> 10:59.049
to Alaric Saltzman!

10:59.093 --> 11:00.529
All right,
'cause he's the reason

11:00.572 --> 11:02.749
I am walking and talking and...

11:02.792 --> 11:05.752
and singing, which I know
we're all grateful for.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.754
So thanks, Ric, for...

11:07.797 --> 11:10.539
dumping a bunch of students
you couldn't control over here,

11:10.582 --> 11:12.628
'cause the second
they got bored, they...

11:12.672 --> 11:15.065
woke me up!

11:17.764 --> 11:20.070
Or is that you, Ric?

11:20.114 --> 11:21.724
No, no, no, it can't be.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.378
You wouldn't be dumb enough

11:23.421 --> 11:25.815
to come here
and check up on me, would you?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.730
Oh, but grief is...

11:27.774 --> 11:29.950
is complicated, right?

11:29.993 --> 11:33.605
Widowers do strangethings.

11:33.649 --> 11:34.955
Ooh...

11:40.961 --> 11:43.006
DIEGO:
Dr. Saltzman.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.747
I'll be damned.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.836
Diego.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.883
Wait.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.885
Talk to me.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.583
Yeah, you know,
I'd rather show you something.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.213
I can control it now.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.955
Doesn't hurt anymore,
'cause you sent me to a world

12:18.999 --> 12:20.652
where it's always
the same day.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.916
And every night...

12:22.959 --> 12:24.961
a full moon.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.571
Ten years.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.836
Thousands of turns.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.187
I didn't realize...

12:33.230 --> 12:34.623
I don't care.

12:34.666 --> 12:37.582
Like younever did.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.687
You.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.820
What can I say?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
I'm all heart.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.825
Hey, look at us--

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
we're beard bros.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.273
Dad!

13:16.317 --> 13:17.492
Josie.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.886
Oh, God.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.413
What are you doing with him?
He could've killed you.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.023
He saved my life, actually.I don't care.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.068
He's a liar.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.634
You can't trust him.
You hear me?

13:29.678 --> 13:31.636
Was he lying when he told me
you sent a bunch

13:31.680 --> 13:32.899
of your old students here
to punish them?

13:34.901 --> 13:37.120
I told you,
we all make mistakes.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.777
I'm not about to make
the same one twice.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.956
Dad, you can't kill
him in this world.

13:48.392 --> 13:51.787
Well, I'm sure as hell
gonna try.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.618
Do you like it?

13:58.011 --> 13:59.273
Hmm?

13:59.316 --> 14:00.970
Good.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.885
'Cause it's yours.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.847
Oh, I should have
seen that coming.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.109
Okay.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.111
First death's free, Ric,

14:55.155 --> 14:57.331
but I'm warning you,

14:57.374 --> 14:59.463
if you think that I'm...

15:01.988 --> 15:04.381
Well, I definitely
didn't see this coming.

15:04.425 --> 15:07.080
I didn't want him
trying to stop me.

15:07.123 --> 15:09.996
Stop you from doing what?

15:10.039 --> 15:11.998
Getting us all out of here--

15:12.041 --> 15:14.696
even if that means
partnering up with you.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.880
KAI: So, we need three things--
the apex of the celestial event

15:24.924 --> 15:26.882
that trapped me here,
some Bennett blood,

15:26.926 --> 15:28.101
and the duplicate ascendant,

15:28.144 --> 15:30.103
which is the first thing
I went looking for

15:30.146 --> 15:32.453
when those burnouts
woke me up.Did you find it?

15:32.496 --> 15:34.107
No answers for free.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.631
I assume you come carrying
the Bennett blood.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.072
How is it possible

15:43.116 --> 15:44.987
that you came to a prison world

15:45.031 --> 15:47.207
without the one thing you need
to escape it?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.817
Well, it's not exactly
like this trip was planned.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.123
Okay, so then what
exactly are you bringing

15:50.166 --> 15:51.907
to this partnership?

15:51.951 --> 15:54.562
Because from where I stand,
I'm the only one of us

15:54.605 --> 15:56.085
who is not useless.

15:56.129 --> 15:58.087
No answers for free.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.481
What's the celestial event?

16:00.524 --> 16:04.006
That I actually don't
know, but, uh...

16:04.050 --> 16:05.355
there's only so many
minutes in a day,

16:05.399 --> 16:07.662
so I'll figure it out.That's your plan?

16:07.705 --> 16:09.359
Mm-hmm.Process of elimination?

16:09.403 --> 16:11.057
I like a challenge.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.928
And to be honest,

16:12.972 --> 16:14.930
I've got nothing but time.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.413
Could the Sandclock be strong
enough to power the ascendant

16:19.456 --> 16:21.632
withouta celestial event?

16:23.765 --> 16:25.114
Maybe.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.248
Why? Where is it?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.685
Somewhere in this clearing.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.210
Then why don't I see it?

16:34.254 --> 16:35.907
Because I put a spell on it.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.214
You wouldn't even know
that you were looking at it.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.216
You know, that-that
actually happened to me

16:40.260 --> 16:42.262
with a teddy bear once.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.093
Hmm.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.095
You, uh...

16:49.138 --> 16:53.055
you really don't trust me,
do you?

17:05.154 --> 17:07.591
Consider it
a show of good faith.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.429
You were lying.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.607
You're definitely learning.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.945
Thank you.

17:56.988 --> 18:00.470
This has already been the most
amazing date of my life.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.605
I don't want it to end.

18:04.648 --> 18:07.260
Perhaps it doesn't have to.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.828
We have to go back
at some point.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.179
My family
will be looking for me.

18:14.528 --> 18:18.053
We can convince my dad
that he was wrong about you.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.750
He just...

18:19.794 --> 18:21.535
needs time.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.364
That's not going to work,
I'm afraid.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.192
Because I'm not going back.

18:26.235 --> 18:30.326
I wish to remain
in this world...

18:30.370 --> 18:33.764
and I want you
to stay with me.

18:33.808 --> 18:36.767
JOSIE:
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

18:36.811 --> 18:38.552
Why are we here?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.206
Oh. Information
for information.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.338
Tell me more
about this Malivore pit

18:42.382 --> 18:44.340
and those monsters
you've been dealing with.

18:44.384 --> 18:48.083
And for the record, I never
lost faith in Santa being real.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.217
Basically, Malivore is a
pocket dimension, like this one.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.609
There is a portal
into our world.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.045
We closed it, but the
monsters keep coming.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.177
Fascinating.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.961
Now, to answer yourquestion,

18:57.005 --> 18:59.181
we're here
because I spent years

18:59.225 --> 19:00.617
studying genealogical records

19:00.661 --> 19:04.186
while being hunted
and killed for sport.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.622
I recently found someone

19:05.666 --> 19:08.016
who donated blood
under the name Smithfield,

19:08.059 --> 19:09.626
which was her married name.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.672
Maiden name: Bennett.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.545
Bennett blood.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.503
Ta-da.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.205
Thank God you're here.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.294
I'm still hungry.

19:27.731 --> 19:30.081
I thought you killed her.Yeah, I totally did.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.040
But they're banished
to this world, like me,

19:32.083 --> 19:34.608
so they just keep...
coming back.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.175
We should go.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.410
Josie?

20:01.461 --> 20:03.637
Is that mine?

20:03.680 --> 20:04.942
Weird.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.729
Now...

20:08.772 --> 20:10.165
where were we?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.906
WENDY:
Wait.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.825
Don't kill him yet, D.Let me guess.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.696
You want to burn him.Sure.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.655
But first I want to have a chat.

20:21.698 --> 20:24.266
Remember how he
put us on trial

20:24.310 --> 20:27.269
and then abandoned us
to this god-awful place?

20:28.531 --> 20:29.532
I think it's time

20:29.576 --> 20:31.273
for your trial...

20:31.317 --> 20:34.145
Alaric Saltzman.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.889
We need to find my dad
before that werewolf wakes up.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.369
Well, then go.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.501
Save Daddy.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.459
I'm rooting for you.

20:43.503 --> 20:46.288
Although you and your dad
aren't bound to this place,

20:46.332 --> 20:48.290
so at some point-- be it today,
tomorrow or the next--

20:48.334 --> 20:49.639
they'll kill you both.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.467
Sorry, kiddo,
the Bennett blood's gone.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.948
We're trapped here.
Nothing matters.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.342
What if there was another way
to get Bennett blood?

20:56.385 --> 20:57.473
Would you help me then?

20:57.517 --> 20:59.519
Yeah, nice try at manipulation,

20:59.562 --> 21:01.434
but I'm not gonna believe
anything y...

21:06.352 --> 21:08.179
It's Bonnie's from when we sent
the Sandclock here.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.924
I knew you were
holding out on me.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.536
I didn't know
if I could trust you.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.802
Okay.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.500
Oh, goodness.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.504
Oh, perfect timing,
baby.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.941
Immobilus.

21:30.985 --> 21:34.205
Hey, thanks
for your help.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.773
Your instincts were right.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.167
There is no
trusting me.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.212
So, while you've
been playing checkers...

21:42.736 --> 21:45.391
I've been playing chess.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.831
Checkmate.

21:56.010 --> 21:59.405
Yeah, I guess I forgot
to mention one thing about

21:59.448 --> 22:01.581
the whole Hunger Games--
I'm kinda into it.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.148
Keeps the monotony interesting.

22:04.192 --> 22:07.151
Once they woke me up,
they quickly realized my

22:07.195 --> 22:09.371
superior leadership qualities.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.633
They're kind of like
my followers,

22:10.677 --> 22:11.678
I guess you could say.

22:12.983 --> 22:16.639
You can keep your
lousy Sandclock.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.249
I'll be gone
before it breaks.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.645
Oh, chin up.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.344
You're new at conning people.
You'll get better at it.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.390
Take her to Ric.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.479
Don't kill her yet.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.482
Make them both suffer.

22:39.619 --> 22:42.361
I couldn't have done it
without you, kid.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.852
Oh, this is gonna
be fun.

23:01.945 --> 23:04.774
It's so quiet.Mm-hmm.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.473
This is what it was like
every day in my time.

23:07.516 --> 23:11.520
Things were peaceful,
unhurried. I miss it.

23:11.564 --> 23:12.826
But when you have
my hearing,

23:12.869 --> 23:16.612
the modern world
is terribly noisy.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.659
In fact, the only thing
I like about it is you.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.878
Sebastian,

23:21.922 --> 23:23.445
I can't stay.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.448
Okay. Think,

23:26.492 --> 23:28.668
think about this--
Vienna,

23:28.711 --> 23:30.626
Beijing, Florence.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.454
You can wear
the crown jewels

23:32.498 --> 23:34.674
and live in Versailles.

23:34.717 --> 23:38.417
This world belongs only to us.

23:39.679 --> 23:42.377
It's not that simple.

23:44.074 --> 23:47.643
I have a family
that I love,

23:47.687 --> 23:50.472
and you won't age.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.519
I wasn't banished
to this world, so I will.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.869
I have a solution
for that.

23:59.525 --> 24:03.093
Allow me to turn you
into a vampire.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.578
If you're planning on
torturing me,

24:09.622 --> 24:13.626
you're gonna be disappointed.
I can handle the torture.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.062
JADE:
How about

24:15.105 --> 24:19.675
seeing your daughter
be tortured?

24:19.719 --> 24:21.590
Josie.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.422
Josie, are you okay?

24:27.466 --> 24:28.945
For now, but
what happens next

24:28.989 --> 24:30.991
is up to you.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.688
So talk.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.298
'Cause I've waited ten years

24:34.342 --> 24:37.345
for an explanation
for what you did to us.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.612
What other choice
did you leave me?

24:43.656 --> 24:47.398
Tell me, how did this happen?

24:47.442 --> 24:49.357
No idea.

24:49.400 --> 24:52.534
The three of you convinced Josie
to let you out of detention.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.536
Wendy and Diego aren't talking.

24:54.580 --> 24:57.757
Jade, you're not like them.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.542
You're a good student.
You care about people.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.675
You're applying to med school
because you want to save lives.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.720
Talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.722
Help me understand
because this,

25:06.766 --> 25:10.247
this... isn't you.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.206
Yeah, well, maybe
you don't know the real me.

25:15.252 --> 25:19.735
One of the victims,
her name's Inez.

25:19.779 --> 25:22.608
There's a picture of you two
on your bulletin board.

25:24.435 --> 25:25.785
Why did you rip her throat out?

25:25.828 --> 25:28.527
I wasn't there.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.665
She was holding this.

25:38.885 --> 25:40.582
It's yours.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.421
So just go ahead and punish us.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.858
You've already
made up your mind.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.603
Right.

26:11.221 --> 26:13.310
ALARIC:
I knew what I had to do.

26:13.354 --> 26:16.226
Five people were dead,
brutally murdered.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.272
Fed on,

26:18.315 --> 26:20.840
ripped apart,
dismembered,

26:20.883 --> 26:22.537
burned to cover it up.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.974
And not one of you
showed any remorse

26:25.018 --> 26:26.672
or even admitted
what you had done.

26:26.715 --> 26:27.847
I couldn't let you
stay at the school.

26:27.890 --> 26:30.023
I wasn't gonna unleash you
into the world.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.241
DIEGO:
So you sent us here

26:31.285 --> 26:32.678
forever?

26:32.721 --> 26:34.593
Is that how you help
your students?

26:35.681 --> 26:37.465
No.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.991
I made a mistake.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.254
I should have killed you.

26:48.389 --> 26:51.871
Ooh, doubling down in the
face of imminent death.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.350
Ballsy.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.265
I knew you were killers,

26:55.309 --> 26:57.528
that you wouldn't change.

26:57.572 --> 27:00.140
It was Caroline that talked me
into showing you mercy.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.794
DIEGO:
Enough talk. Let's kill him.

27:01.837 --> 27:05.754
No. I want him to suffer first.

27:05.798 --> 27:09.149
You two go check on Kai.
He has all the pieces
to get us out now.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.890
Make sure
he doesn't leave us behind.

27:21.944 --> 27:25.905
You're so sure you're right.

27:25.948 --> 27:29.691
How about I tell you what
actually happened that night?

27:37.786 --> 27:41.703
Inez invited me
to a party in the woods.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.704
We'd been flirting

27:42.748 --> 27:44.314
for a few months.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.490
I thought it was my
chance to finally see

27:46.534 --> 27:48.710
if she was really
into girls or not.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.538
Wendy really wanted to come,

27:50.581 --> 27:53.367
and she was trying to get Diego
to notice her,

27:53.410 --> 27:54.760
so she talked me
into bringing him, too.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.370
Hey.

27:56.413 --> 27:57.632
Hey.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.764
I'm glad you came.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.591
Wow. Inez actually got

28:00.635 --> 28:03.290
three of the boarding
school losers to show up.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.816
Wh-What's he talking about?

28:09.992 --> 28:11.864
It was a freak party.

28:11.907 --> 28:15.389
Seeing who could get
the biggest weirdo to show up.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.608
Yeah, they took one look at us,

28:17.652 --> 28:18.740
and they just...

28:18.784 --> 28:19.915
they knew we were different.

28:19.959 --> 28:22.048
Let's go.

28:25.399 --> 28:26.356
Check this out.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.935
Diego, don't.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.328
It should have ended there.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.764
I could have stopped it,
but I froze.

28:42.808 --> 28:45.593
Maybe I didn't want
to prove them right

28:45.636 --> 28:46.812
about us being different.

28:46.855 --> 28:50.119
Or maybe part of me

28:50.163 --> 28:52.426
wanted it to happen.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.561
Everything after that's a blur.

28:57.605 --> 28:58.562
Somebody call
the cops!

28:59.520 --> 29:01.348
No! Don't!

29:13.186 --> 29:15.971
I did find out something
that night.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.713
I'm a ripper.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.802
No! No.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.153
Jade, please.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.851
No, Jade.

29:25.894 --> 29:27.156
I'm so sorry.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.028
No!

29:30.725 --> 29:33.467
That was the worst moment
of my life.

29:33.510 --> 29:36.818
You think I didn't feel
any remorse for what happened.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.037
But I did.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.299
Shame.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.300
Guilt.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.302
Panic.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.521
I couldn't bear feeling
all of it anymore.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.219
So...

29:46.262 --> 29:48.874
I decided not to.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.837
I shut off my humanity
that night.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.321
I was screaming for help.

30:02.539 --> 30:03.802
You just couldn't hear it.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.282
But being here...

30:07.762 --> 30:09.938
...where you sent us,

30:09.982 --> 30:14.073
I've killed Kai, Diego,
and Wendy thousands of times.

30:14.116 --> 30:15.901
So maybe you're
right after all.

30:15.944 --> 30:19.469
Because I've finally become the
killer that you thought I was.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.994
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize the signs.

30:22.037 --> 30:24.735
You were too busy
protecting your daughters.

30:26.128 --> 30:28.739
You're good at that.

30:28.783 --> 30:29.740
Let's just see
how good.

30:36.008 --> 30:37.966
Come with me.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.838
There's a game I want to play.

30:45.539 --> 30:48.020
Have you nothing to say?

30:48.063 --> 30:52.067
Or does your silence mean that
you've already made a decision?

30:52.111 --> 30:53.852
Hmm?

30:55.592 --> 30:57.333
Yes.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.640
I've decided.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.125
I can't make this decision yet.

31:06.168 --> 31:08.910
I've thought
about becoming a vampire.

31:08.954 --> 31:12.087
Of course
I've thought about it.

31:12.131 --> 31:14.568
If I did,
there wouldn't be a Merge.

31:14.611 --> 31:17.266
And my skin
would stay flawless forever.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.576
But I also...

31:22.619 --> 31:25.927
wouldn't be able to have kids.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.799
I couldn't grow old
with someone.

31:28.843 --> 31:32.586
And I don't even know
if those are things that I want.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.762
But that's the point.

31:36.155 --> 31:38.113
I don't know yet.

31:38.157 --> 31:42.422
I can't make this decision
until I'm sure.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.167
I was afraid

31:48.210 --> 31:50.125
that you would say that.

31:50.169 --> 31:53.128
So it's time
that you knew

31:53.172 --> 31:55.783
that what I'm offering
isn't a choice.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.828
Yes, it is.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.962
I'm not gonna drink
vampire blood.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.355
You already have.

32:14.845 --> 32:16.630
Sebastian...

32:16.673 --> 32:18.762
what have you done?

32:18.806 --> 32:21.852
What I had to to keep you safe.

32:31.210 --> 32:35.388
And this is
the fun part.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.172
It's what we do
with Kai.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.174
Basically,
it's hide-and-seek.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.176
You run and hide...

32:41.220 --> 32:44.005
and I seek.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.137
No.

32:45.180 --> 32:46.877
Uh, yes.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.618
Or else I will hurt Josie.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.229
I will hurt her so bad

32:50.272 --> 32:52.405
that she will be begging
for me to kill her.

32:52.448 --> 32:55.625
Come on. It's supposed
to be fun. You know what?

32:55.669 --> 32:58.019
I'll even give you
a five-minute head start.

32:58.063 --> 33:02.023
And if you can survive
being hunted for 24 hours,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.025
I will let your daughter live.

33:05.679 --> 33:08.464
I mean, that's all
you really care about, right?

33:08.508 --> 33:11.076
Fine.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.121
Let's play.

33:20.302 --> 33:23.262
Elizabeth, you must
listen to reason.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.090
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.092
You must believe me.Let me go.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.919
Please listen to me!

33:28.963 --> 33:31.270
Please.

33:31.313 --> 33:32.749
Please.

33:34.273 --> 33:37.711
I once cared for a witch
who died in front of me.

33:37.754 --> 33:41.236
She didn't have a chance to
become immortal, but you do.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.457
I am trying to help you,
but if you cannot see that,

33:44.500 --> 33:46.676
then I must make
the choice for you,

33:46.720 --> 33:48.939
because I love you

33:48.983 --> 33:50.071
too much.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.073
Can you hear that?

33:52.117 --> 33:56.164
I love you, and I will not
lose you again, Cassandra.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.476
Elizabeth. I meant Elizabeth.

34:37.597 --> 34:40.556
I think
we should see other people.

34:54.353 --> 34:57.225
Where the hell is he?

34:57.269 --> 34:59.749
Kai Parker screwed us.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.048
I'll be damned.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.139
Josie Saltzman screwed me.

36:29.448 --> 36:31.232
Who is this?

36:31.276 --> 36:32.581
KAI:
Thank God

36:32.625 --> 36:35.410
you're still alive.
I was worried sick.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.282
Hey, I got to say,

36:37.325 --> 36:39.240
I'm not even mad about the whole

36:39.284 --> 36:40.589
blood con.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.243
Borderline proud, even.

36:42.287 --> 36:44.593
Okay, I'm-I'm always mad.

36:44.637 --> 36:47.161
But in a fun, completely
unpredictable sort of way.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.815
It keeps you on your toes.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.469
I hate you.Yeah.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.122
That's such a Ric thing to say.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.907
Hey, how is the old man
nowadays?

36:53.950 --> 36:56.344
I hate you for everything
that you've done to my family,

36:56.388 --> 36:58.346
and I am never helping you
get out of here.

36:58.390 --> 37:01.393
You're a liar, and nothing
you ever say will matter to me.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.265
Actually, I called
to help youget out.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.660
There is another way.

37:09.009 --> 37:11.054
Does what I say matter now?

37:11.098 --> 37:13.448
I don't believe you.Yeah, okay,
that's totally understandable.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.972
But you still got Darth Vader's
alarm clock, right?

37:17.104 --> 37:19.324
Maybe.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.542
Good.

every last bit

37:22.414 --> 37:24.242
of its power to pull this off.

37:27.462 --> 37:29.682
So much for trusting him.

37:31.205 --> 37:32.554
Your boyfriend left us here.Yeah, well,

37:32.598 --> 37:34.469
it's a good thing
I prefer girls anyway.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.471
Besides, I don't care
about that guy.

37:36.515 --> 37:38.343
All I care about right now
is finding Saltzman.
