WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:08.142
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED

00:08.176 --> 00:09.577
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.345
LOOK AT YOU.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.681
PUBLIC SERVANT BY
DAY, HOTTIE BY NIGHT.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.583
WELL, I HAVE TO TURN DOWN
THE HEAT DURING THE DAY

00:15.616 --> 00:18.619
- OR NOBODY'D GET ANYTHING DONE.
- OOH, COUNCIL STORY'S UP.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.621
From now on we're capping

00:20.654 --> 00:22.690
elementary school class
size at 22 students.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.126
This is garbage,

00:25.159 --> 00:27.161
which is piling up in
front of my restaurant

00:27.195 --> 00:29.663
'cause you cut pick-ups
to once a week!

00:29.697 --> 00:31.165
Well, a reduction
in trash services

00:31.199 --> 00:32.700
is what pays for the
smaller class sizes.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.702
CRAZY GUY WITH A TRASH
BAG COMING AT YOU

00:34.735 --> 00:37.271
AND YOU STAY THE MATURE,
RATIONAL ADULT.

00:37.305 --> 00:40.741
YES, I DID. SUCK
IT, GARBAGE GUY!

00:40.774 --> 00:43.311
OH, AND THEN THIS DUDE.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.779
Hey, don't be that guy.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.515
Don't be that guy that
brings your garbage

00:47.548 --> 00:49.717
into a public arena and
acts like a crazy person.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.121
- Act like a gentleman.
- Thank you.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.255
Now where the hell is the money

00:54.288 --> 00:57.191
your brother-in-law
stole from me?

00:57.225 --> 00:59.693
What my sister and my
brother-in-law did was wrong, okay?

00:59.727 --> 01:01.362
But that's not me.
Let me ask the room:

01:01.395 --> 01:04.365
Does anybody here have a relative
they're not exactly proud of?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.700
Whew! It's not just me.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.702
AT LEAST HE WAS CUTE.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.704
YEAH, I DON'T SEE IT.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.673
BUT YOU HELD YOUR OWN UP THERE.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.042
YOU REMIND ME OF YOUR FATHER,
THE ESTEEMED SENATOR.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.545
OH MY GOD. DID I SMELL
LIKE STRIPPERS?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.281
NO, YOU SMELLED LIKE AUTHORITY.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.816
- OH. WELL, THAT IS MY FRAGRANCE.
- MM-HMM.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.752
YEAH, I HAVE TO SAY
IN ALL HUMILITY,

01:24.785 --> 01:26.287
I WAS, YES, SMOKIN'.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.590
- UP HIGH. DOWN LOW.
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.592
PLUS YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW'S
VARIOUS FELONIES

01:31.625 --> 01:33.161
TOTALLY SHIFTED THE
FOCUS OF THE MEETING.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.563
I THINK YOU PUT THE WHOLE
TRASH ISSUE TO BED.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.566
AUNT MEL, WHY ARE
ANGRY WHITE GUYS

01:38.599 --> 01:40.534
THROWING TRASH AT
OUR FRONT DOOR?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.636
THERE IS A POLITICAL
DEBATE IN THE COMMUNITY

01:42.670 --> 01:44.705
IN WHICH THE MAJORITY FEELS...

01:44.738 --> 01:46.574
THIS IS GETTING HEAVY...
( sniffs )

01:46.607 --> 01:49.310
AND REALLY SMELLY.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.412
I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE THIS
HERE FOR YOU, AUNT MEL.

01:51.445 --> 01:54.748
- THERE'S, LIKE, 10 MORE ON THE PORCH.
- Mel: HEY, LENNOX! LENNOX!

01:54.782 --> 01:57.585
DID YOU SEE THE DRESSER
I PUT IN YOUR ROOM?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.621
YEAH, IT'S REALLY
CUTE, BUT I'M OKAY.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.890
I'VE GOT SUITCASES.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.595
SHE THINKS LIVING
HERE IS TEMPORARY?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.663
SHE NO LONGER TELLS
ME WHAT SHE THINKS.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.132
I USED TO BE I'LL-SNEAK-YOU-
OUT-OF-THE-HOUSE AUNT MEL,

02:12.166 --> 02:13.467
LET'S-GET-MATCHING
- TATTOOS AUNT MEL.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.436
NOW I'M BECAUSE-I-SAID-SO
AUNT MEL.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.838
I DO HORRIBLE THINGS LIKE
PUT FURNITURE IN HER ROOM.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.607
CLEARLY, I'M A MONSTER.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.808
OF COURSE SHE'S DIFFICULT.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.676
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHAT
YOU WERE LIKE AT 15?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.745
NOT VERY CLEARLY.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.780
I DID A LOT OF DRINKING THEN.

02:28.416 --> 02:31.252
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:31.285 --> 02:33.153
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:38.759 --> 02:40.528
RYDER, I'M GOING OUT TONIGHT,

02:40.561 --> 02:42.363
SO RHONDA'S STAYING WITH YOU
GUYS IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.498
COACH SAYS I NEED A
BETTER JUMP SHOT.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.766
YOU GOT ONE OF THOSE?

02:45.799 --> 02:48.702
YES, WE ASIAN WOMEN ARE
ALL ABOUT THE HOOPS.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.707
SO IF YOU'VE GOT ANY
HOMEWORK, DO IT.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.377
AND BEYOND THAT JUST, YOU KNOW,

02:56.410 --> 02:58.912
BE GOOD AND DON'T...

02:58.946 --> 03:01.715
- TORCH THE PLACE?
- YES.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.557
IT WAS ONE LITTLE
SINGLE-ALARM FIRE

03:09.590 --> 03:12.626
AT HIS OLD HOUSE THE WEEK HIS FATHER
RAN OFF. HE WAS ANGRY. HE JUST...

03:12.660 --> 03:14.628
STACKED 20 OF HIS DAD'S
SUITS ON THE DRIVEWAY,

03:14.662 --> 03:17.565
ADDED SOME TOP-SHELF
COGNAC AND LIT 'EM UP?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.701
IN A WAY, BUT WE ALL NEED

03:20.734 --> 03:22.770
- TO LET THINGS OUT EVERY NOW AND THEN.
- NO, WE DON'T.

03:22.803 --> 03:26.607
THE URGE TO SET THINGS
ON FIRE, WE REPRESS.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.609
THANKS FOR BABYSITTING.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.278
I HAVEN'T HAD A DATE
SINCE THE KIDS MOVED IN.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.280
IT'S BEEN SO LONG, I'M
ACTUALLY NERVOUS.

03:32.313 --> 03:35.249
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:35.283 --> 03:38.419
THESE SAY "SMART, INDEPENDENT,
BRIGHT POLITICAL FUTURE."

03:38.452 --> 03:41.422
THESE SAY "FORMER BAD GIRL.
SHE'S BACK!"

03:43.257 --> 03:45.693
WHAT, ARE YOU GOING HIKING?
THOSE.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.529
- ( cell phone ringing )
- Both: THAT'S YOURS.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.499
- MEL BURKE.
- RHONDA CHANG.

03:51.532 --> 03:52.633
- YES, HELLO?
- YEAH?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.668
- SCHOOL PRINCIPAL.
- CHANNEL 5.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.504
- SHE DID WHAT?
- WHAT DID SHE DO?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.539
- WHEN? REALLY?
- WHERE? TODAY?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.408
Both: LENNOX DID THAT?

04:00.441 --> 04:02.343
- LIZ, I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
- NO, SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.244
- IT'S NOT AT ALL TYPICAL.
- OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.747
- I KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S SERIOUS.
- IS THIS REALLY SERIOUS?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.816
- I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED.
- I'LL TALK TO MEL,

04:08.849 --> 04:11.652
BUT I'M TELLING YOU THIS
COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.787
GUESS WHAT.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.990
TODAY AT SCHOOL LENNOX
HANDED OUT FLYERS

04:17.024 --> 04:19.527
CONTAINING AN ORIGINAL POEM

04:19.560 --> 04:22.296
RHYMING HER PRINCIPAL'S
NAME IN A CREATIVE WAY THAT

04:22.330 --> 04:24.264
DIDN'T GO OVER WELL
WITH MISS LUNT.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.804
NOT TO SEND UP A FLARE,

04:30.838 --> 04:32.973
BUT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
CHANNEL 5 HAS THE STORY.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.875
- ARE YOU SURE?
- PRETTY SURE.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.378
I WAS JUST ON THE AIR,
LIVE, DENYING IT.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.682
TWO MONTHS LIVING WITH ME
AND SHE GETS SUSPENDED.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.384
LEGAL GUARDIAN OF THE YEAR.
THANK YOU.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.753
I KEEP TELLING YOU:
HIRE SOMEBODY...

04:45.786 --> 04:47.455
AN ORGANIZER, A PROFESSIONAL.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.623
THOSE KIDS NEED STRUCTURE
AND DISCIPLINE

04:49.657 --> 04:51.692
AND POSSIBLY
ELECTRO-SHOCK THERAPY.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.662
AND YOU, MY DEAR,
CANNOT DO EVERYTHING.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.296
WELL, MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING,

04:56.330 --> 04:57.731
BUT I CAN CERTAINLY DO THIS.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.999
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF GOING UP THERE

04:59.032 --> 05:01.502
AND SETTING THAT GIRL STRAIGHT.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.505
I HAVEN'T MOVED YET, HAVE I?

05:06.440 --> 05:08.709
WHY ISN'T MY SISTER HERE TO
DISCIPLINE HER OWN DAUGHTER?

05:08.742 --> 05:09.977
BECAUSE SHE'S LOCKED
UP IN FEDERAL PRISON.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.612
MAN, THAT'S A SWEET DEAL.

05:13.814 --> 05:17.685
HEY, LENNOX, REMEMBER YOU AND
ME AT THE FALL OUT BOY CONCERT?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.019
I JUST FOUND THIS OLD PICTURE.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.721
OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE
THAT WAS HANGING

05:20.754 --> 05:22.723
VERY OBVIOUSLY IN THE
HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE DOOR?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.726
NOT OBVIOUSLY... AFFECTIONATELY.

05:25.759 --> 05:29.863
THAT WAS SOME NIGHT, HUH?
FALL OUT BOY! WHOO-HOO!

05:31.031 --> 05:32.466
WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH THIS?

05:32.500 --> 05:35.035
I WAS JUST REMEMBERING THE
GOOD TIMES, YOU KNOW,

05:35.068 --> 05:38.672
WHEN WE SHARED, TOLD
EACH OTHER THINGS.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.841
IMPORTANT THINGS...

05:40.874 --> 05:43.076
THAT HAPPENED... TODAY.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.479
OH, COME ON. YOU DIDN'T THINK

05:45.513 --> 05:47.047
"I GOT SUSPENDED" WAS
SOMETHING YOU MIGHT SHARE?

05:47.080 --> 05:49.750
OKAY, I WILL SHARE THIS:
MISS LUNT IS A FASCIST.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.686
WHY COULDN'T HAVE
CALLED HER THAT?

05:52.720 --> 05:55.055
INSTEAD OF... YOU KNOW.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.725
WELL, I NEVER GOT IN
TROUBLE AT MY OLD SCHOOL.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.461
THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS
BOUGHT THE INDOOR POOL.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.597
IT DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A SPA.
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

06:03.631 --> 06:07.367
WHATEVER. LOOK, MISS LUNT
IS EXPECTING AN APOLOGY.

06:07.401 --> 06:10.571
YOU AND I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT DOWN
IN HER OFFICE AT 3:00 TOMORROW.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.406
GREAT. YOU LET ME
KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.943
LENNOX, UNTIL YOU TALK TO HER
YOU CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.812
OH WELL, GUESS I'M NOT
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.714
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.684
THIS IS YOUR EDUCATION.
NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT!

06:23.717 --> 06:25.919
- ( doorbell rings )
- OH, THAT'S MY DATE! OOH!

06:25.953 --> 06:27.688
I HAVE MORE TO SAY.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.823
YOU JUST STAY RIGHT THERE. STAY.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.763
OH, GROSS.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.500
I WAS EXPECTING MY DATE.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.836
I'LL BE QUICK. I WAS A
JACKASS DOWN AT CITY HALL

06:42.870 --> 06:44.104
AND I NEVER SHOULD'VE
CRASHED YOUR MEETING

06:44.137 --> 06:45.873
ASKING WHERE YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW WAS.
THAT WAS WRONG.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.876
I JUST WANTED TO COME HERE
AND SAY THAT I'M SORRY.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.880
BOLIVIA! LEWIS IS IN
BOLIVIA, ISN'T HE?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.983
- YOU JUST FLINCHED.
- I FLINCHED BECAUSE YOU SHOUTED "BOLIVIA."

06:56.016 --> 06:57.718
OKAY, PEOPLE IN
BOLIVIA FLINCHED.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.687
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE HELL HE IS!

06:59.720 --> 07:01.522
NOW GET LOST AND LEAVE ME AL...
HI, GRIFFIN.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.758
HEY, DON'T YOU LOOK NICE
AND SMELL HANDSOME.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.127
- WHO'S THIS GUY?
- OH, NO GUY.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.096
I'M A... ( grunts )

07:10.163 --> 07:12.600
LOOK, GRIFFIN,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.635
I KNOW YOU'VE WAITED A
LONG TIME FOR THIS DATE

07:14.668 --> 07:16.103
AND SO HAVE I. I MEAN, LOOK.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.739
- RIGHT?
- ( chuckles )

07:18.772 --> 07:20.508
BUT I HAVE A NIECE IN CRISIS,

07:20.541 --> 07:22.042
AND I REALLY WANT
TO GO ON THIS DATE.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.712
BUT, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
TO SPEND TIME WITH HER

07:24.745 --> 07:27.481
AND I SO WANT TO BE SPENDING
TIME WITH YOU BUT...

07:27.515 --> 07:30.083
MAN, YOU SMELL GREAT. LOOK, I'M
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS DATE,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.686
I JUST CAN'T GO ON IT.
SO LET ME DO THIS.

07:33.887 --> 07:37.090
THERE. THAT SHOULD HOLD
YOU FOR A FEW WEEKS.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.527
MAYBE MORE. WE JUST DON'T KNOW.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.599
( clears throat ) WOW.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.601
THAT'S A WHOLE BUCKET OF CRAZY.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.748
HI, RHONDA. I KNOW I'M LATE.
REALLY? THAT LATE?

08:01.849 --> 08:04.451
YES, I FILLED OUT THE PAPERWORK
FOR THE NANNY AGENCY.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.754
IT'S RIGHT HERE. NO
KIDDING, I'M LATE?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.656
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID THAT BEFORE.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.791
( doorbell rings )

08:14.662 --> 08:16.597
OH, DEAR GOD.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.566
RELAX. IT'S A HAPPY VISIT TODAY.

08:18.599 --> 08:19.900
- MAY I?
- NO.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.035
SO I FOUND THE CITY
BUDGET ONLINE LAST NIGHT

08:22.069 --> 08:23.871
AND I WENT THROUGH IT.
HERE'S A THOUGHT:

08:23.904 --> 08:25.873
THE CASH IN THE GENERAL FUND
THAT'S JUST SITTING THERE...

08:25.906 --> 08:27.908
HIRE ME AND I'LL DOUBLE
YOUR RATE OF RETURN.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.477
THAT WAY YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY FOR SMALLER CLASS SIZES

08:30.510 --> 08:33.681
AND EXTRA GARBAGE PICK-UPS
AND PIE FOR EVERYONE.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.884
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PLAN
AND I'D SIGN UP IMMEDIATELY

08:36.917 --> 08:38.518
IF YOU WEREN'T A
COMPLETE LUNATIC.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.754
JOSEPH LONGO IS NOT A LUNATIC.

08:40.788 --> 08:44.592
JOE LONGO? YOU'RE JOE LONGO?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.794
YOU RAN LEWIS'S
COMMODITIES DIVISION.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.663
- YOU MADE HIM MILLIONS.
- LEGITIMATE MILLIONS, YEAH.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.132
THAT YOUR BASTARD
BROTHER-IN-LAW PISSED AWAY!

08:52.165 --> 08:54.668
SORRY, HAPPY VISIT.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.704
YEAH, YOU WENT ALL "BOLIVIA"
THERE FOR A MINUTE.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.673
YEAH YEAH. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:59.707 --> 09:01.775
MAYBE YOU COULD GET
ME A JOB DOWNTOWN?

09:01.809 --> 09:04.011
THERE'S A HIRING FREEZE.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.813
I'M REALLY SORRY
YOU LOST YOUR JOB.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.081
YEAH, THAT'S OLD NEWS.
YESTERDAY I LOST MY CONDO.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.617
YEAH, WELL, I REALLY NEED...

09:09.650 --> 09:11.752
AND NOW... NOW THEY'RE
ABOUT TO REPOSSESS MY CAR.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.755
OH OH, BUT HERE... HERE IS
THE MORNING'S BIG HEADLINE:

09:14.788 --> 09:17.557
THE ADORABLE MRS. LONGO HAS
DECAMPED TO HER MOTHER'S HOUSE.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.092
( chuckles ) GOD.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.863
I'M REALLY GONNA MISS THAT CAR.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.300
HOW CAN I PUT THIS NICELY?
I'VE GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.738
- SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME?
- DO YOU LIVE IN MY DISTRICT?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.806
NOW THAT I'M LIVING
IN MY CAR, YEAH.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.176
LOOK, I'VE GOT MEETINGS, A TRASH
REVOLT, A KID ON THE BRINK

09:36.209 --> 09:38.245
AND I'M IN DESPERATE NEED
OF PROFESSIONAL HELP.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.147
FOR THE HOUSEHOLD, NOT ME.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.149
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
FIND ANYBODY THIS WAY.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.017
THIS SALARY SUCKS.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.953
IT'S LIVE-IN. IT
INCLUDES MEALS...

09:45.986 --> 09:49.222
WHICH SHE'LL BE COOKING BECAUSE
OTHERWISE PEOPLE WILL STARVE.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.625
SHE? IT HAS TO BE A WOMAN?

09:51.659 --> 09:53.727
ONLY VAGINO-AMERICANS
NEED APPLY?

09:56.163 --> 09:59.199
PERSONAL QUESTION: DID YOUR
HAIR GET SICK OF YOU AND LEAVE?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.068
THIS IS A CHOICE.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.106
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, LOOK LOOK LOOK LOOK.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.075
WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S A
LOW-BALL OFFER, ALL RIGHT?

10:08.108 --> 10:10.844
SO COME ON, WHAT'S... WHAT'S
YOUR TOP NUMBER THERE?

10:10.878 --> 10:13.847
- THAT IS MY TOP NUMBER.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT A DEAL, BUT I CAN'T START TILL MONDAY.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.016
- WHO OFFERED YOU A JOB?
- ALL RIGHT, I CAN START TODAY.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.751
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO
MOVE A FEW THINGS AROUND.

10:17.785 --> 10:21.621
MOSTLY, MY CAR. TUESDAY IS
STREET CLEANING, ISN'T IT?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.024
YOU DO KNOW WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A NANNY HERE, RIGHT?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.259
THERE ARE CHILDREN INVOLVED.
YOU EVER WORK WITH KIDS?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.628
ARE YOU KIDDING? RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE
I RAN A YOUTH CENTER DOWNTOWN.

10:28.662 --> 10:29.863
I WAS IN CHARGE OF
50 TEENAGERS...

10:29.897 --> 10:31.799
COOKED 'EM MEALS, HELPED
'EM WITH THEIR HOMEWORK.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.835
I WAS CHARLES
FRICKIN' IN CHARGE.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.039
YEAH, YOU'RE PERFECT.
THERE'S ONE LITTLE DETAIL:

10:39.072 --> 10:40.708
I DON'T REALLY LIKE YOU.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.609
( door opens )

10:42.642 --> 10:45.378
YOU KNOW THAT SCHOOL BUS?
NOT RUNNING TODAY.

10:45.412 --> 10:48.849
JACKSON STREET'S BLOCKED BECAUSE
OF SOME KIND OF GARBAGE PROTEST.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.818
CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP CRAP!

10:50.851 --> 10:52.820
OH, I MEAN, GOLLY, TOUGH BREAK.

10:52.853 --> 10:56.323
OKAY I'LL TAKE YOU. I'LL
JUST MISS MY MEETING.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.225
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE
NEED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.193
NO NO NO NO, YOU'LL MAKE YOUR MEETING.
I'LL TAKE HIM.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.762
- HEY, I'M JOE.
- HI.

11:01.795 --> 11:05.265
SEE THAT PORSCHE OUT THERE?
YEAH, IT'S MINE...

11:05.298 --> 11:07.400
FOR 10 MORE DAYS.

11:07.434 --> 11:11.204
- SWEET.
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT...

11:11.238 --> 11:12.873
OH, SCREW IT. BUCKLE UP!

11:16.409 --> 11:18.979
ISN'T THAT THE CUTE YELLING
GUY FROM YESTERDAY?

11:19.012 --> 11:21.248
YEAH, HE'S A HOMELESS
COMMODITIES TRADER.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.785
HE'S TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS.
HOW HIGH DO I SOUND RIGHT NOW?

11:30.457 --> 11:32.893
RHONDA, BOTTOM LINE:
SHE SOUNDS GREAT.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.762
THE PERFECT NANNY.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.329
YOU WERE RIGHT. I
CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.832
WHAT, THE COMMODITIES TRADER?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.367
NO, HE'S JUST TEMPORARY.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.668
AND HE'S NOT CUTE.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.437
NO, HE'S NOT. HE HAS NO HAIR.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.339
OKAY, BEFORE WE PULL
THE NANNY TRIGGER,

11:46.373 --> 11:48.141
- WHEN DO I INTERVIEW THIS LADY?
- HELLO

11:48.175 --> 11:50.377
- UH, HOLD ON A SEC.
- HEY, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING:

11:50.410 --> 11:52.813
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME ANYBODY DID
ANY THE LAUNDRY IN THIS HOUSEHOLD?

11:52.846 --> 11:56.784
- YOU PEOPLE LIVE LIKE PIGS.
- THESE ARE MY DELICATES!

11:56.817 --> 11:58.752
HOW DID YOU GET MY DELICATES?
WERE YOU IN MY ROOM?

11:58.786 --> 12:00.487
( chuckles ) YEAH.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.758
- PULL THE TRIGGER.
- HEY, JOE, YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.827
I SHOULD HAVE THAT SANDWICH NOW.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.862
- HEY, MEL.
- ALL RIGHT, GET BACK UP THERE!

12:08.896 --> 12:10.297
WHAT IS HE DOING HOME IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

12:10.330 --> 12:12.265
- HIS HISTORY PAPER.
- WHAT?!

12:12.299 --> 12:14.802
WOW. ALL RIGHT, PACK THE
VEINS BACK IN YOUR FOREHEAD.

12:14.835 --> 12:17.004
I TOOK THE KID TO SCHOOL, RIGHT,

12:17.037 --> 12:18.171
AND HE TELLS ME HE DIDN'T
HAVE HIS HISTORY PAPER.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.840
SO WE DRIVE BACK HERE TO GET IT

12:19.873 --> 12:21.809
AND THEN HE TELLS ME HE
DIDN'T EXACTLY WRITE IT.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.310
AND I SAID, "WELL, YOU'D BETTER EXACTLY
WRITE IT BECAUSE IT'S DUE TODAY."

12:23.343 --> 12:24.711
SO HE'S UP THERE WRITING IT NOW.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.815
AND HE DOESN'T COME OUT
UNTIL IT'S DONE. HUH?

12:27.848 --> 12:30.417
NOW THAT'S... THAT'S NANNYING.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.220
YOU BROUGHT HIM HOME?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.022
YOU DON'T BRING A KID HOME
WHO HASN'T DONE HIS WORK.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.124
YOU LEAVE HIM AT SCHOOL TO GET YELLED
AT, WHICH IS WHAT HE'S GOT COMING!

12:37.157 --> 12:38.158
WHAT KIND OF RULES ARE THOSE?

12:38.191 --> 12:39.793
THE RULES THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS!

12:39.827 --> 12:41.261
I'M SOMEBODY. I
NEVER HEARD THEM.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.832
LENNOX, YOU READY?! TIME TO GO!

12:44.865 --> 12:46.967
- SHE'S NOT HERE.
- WHERE IS SHE?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.936
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO WATCH HER.
- YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.905
BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUS.
THE GIRL GOT SUSPENDED!

12:51.939 --> 12:53.841
SHE'S GONE. SHE
DITCHED THE MEETING.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.476
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.379
I JUST SAID YOU WERE RIGHT.
THAT WAS A COMPLIMENT!

13:01.448 --> 13:04.852
OKAY, SHE HAS THREE PLACES SHE
USUALLY GOES AFTER SCHOOL.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.220
- I'LL JUST... I'LL START THERE.
- YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU?

13:07.254 --> 13:10.423
YES. PLEASE DO... NOTHING.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.029
I'M OKAY!

13:16.063 --> 13:17.865
( laptop chimes )

13:27.140 --> 13:28.842
I CAN WORK WITH THIS KID.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.924
WOW.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.326
IS THIS WHERE YOU COME FOR
YOUR ADOLESCENT BROODING?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.496
YOU COME UP HERE TO TURN ME IN?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.165
THAT'S NOT REALLY MY STYLE.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.901
WHAT IS YOUR STYLE?

13:53.934 --> 13:57.971
OUTLAW. CAST OUT BY
THE POWER BROKERS.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.909
FORCED TO LIVE A
LIFE IN THE SHADOWS.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.576
OH, KIND OF LIKE BATMAN

14:03.610 --> 14:05.946
IF HE'D BEEN DEMOTED TO A NANNY.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.447
NICE.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.183
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT A MEETING

14:10.217 --> 14:12.152
AT YOUR PRINCIPAL'S
OFFICE RIGHT NOW?

14:13.353 --> 14:16.256
WHY SHOULD I? CRAP GOES
ON THERE ALL THE TIME.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.557
MISS LUNT FIRES THE
MUSIC TEACHER,

14:17.590 --> 14:19.226
COMPLETELY GETS RID OF THE BAND

14:19.259 --> 14:20.994
AND EVERYBODY'S AFRAID
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.830
I'M TIRED OF LIFE BEING UNFAIR.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.565
HOW ABOUT FOR ONCE
IT JUST BE FAIR?

14:25.598 --> 14:29.336
I'D BE UPSET TOO IF MY MOM
AND DAD BAILED ON ME.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.972
I'M TALKING ABOUT MISS LUNT.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.007
IF YOU SAY SO.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.576
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.912
YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.613
WHAT I REALLY DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU IS

14:40.647 --> 14:42.349
WHY YOU'RE TAKING THIS
ALL OUT ON YOUR AUNT,

14:42.382 --> 14:45.018
BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON
WHO HASN'T BAILED ON YOU.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.521
LOOK, I KNOW SHE CAN GET A
LITTLE SKITZY AT TIMES...

14:49.589 --> 14:52.025
ALL TIMES...

14:52.059 --> 14:54.561
BUT SINCE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT FAIR,

14:54.594 --> 14:57.998
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S FAIR THAT SHE
HAS TO GO DOWN TO YOUR SCHOOL ALL ALONE

14:58.031 --> 15:01.101
AND EAT YOUR BIG BOWL OF STINK FOR
SOMETHING THAT SHE DIDN'T DO?

15:01.134 --> 15:04.938
"BIG BOWL OF STINK"?
WHAT IS THAT?

15:04.972 --> 15:07.941
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN
YOU'VE EATEN ONE.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.344
ANY SIGN OF OUR LENNOX?

15:11.378 --> 15:14.514
OH, MISS LUNT, LOOK. I KNOW
WHAT LENNOX DID WAS BAD...

15:14.547 --> 15:18.251
OKAY, REALLY REALLY BAD...

15:18.285 --> 15:21.521
BUT IF ANY KID HAS THE RIGHT TO BE
UPSET ABOUT WHAT LIFE'S HANDED HER...

15:21.554 --> 15:23.556
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO EXCUSE LENNOX.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.325
I'M JUST SAYING IF I WAS LENNOX,

15:25.358 --> 15:27.394
I'D PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
DONE WORSE BY NOW.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.229
IN FACT, I DID.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.631
THIS IS POINTLESS
WITHOUT LENNOX.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.366
WHY DON'T WE JUST RESCHEDULE?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.603
YOU THINK YOU COULD MANAGE TO FIND
HER BY, SAY, TOMORROW AFTERNOON?

15:36.636 --> 15:39.139
OH, TOMORROW'S CITY
COUNCIL SESSIONS ALL DAY.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.607
BUT WE TAKE LUNCH 12:00 TO 1:00.
I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU...

15:40.640 --> 15:42.642
MISS BURKE, PARENTING
DOESN'T FIT

15:42.675 --> 15:44.644
INTO NICE LITTLE SCHEDULE BOXES.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.581
IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO LOOK NOT
JUST AT WHAT LENNOX IS DOING,

15:48.615 --> 15:52.552
- BUT AT THE JOB YOU'RE DOING.
- SHE'S DOING OKAY.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.589
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.259
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
OTHER DAY WITH THE POEM.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.594
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
STUFF THAT I SAID.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.631
I WAS MAD,

16:04.664 --> 16:07.000
AND APPARENTLY NOT
REALLY AT YOU.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.669
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO BLAME MY AUNT.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.538
SHE'S BEEN GETTING
ENOUGH OF THAT FROM ME.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.142
AT LEAST SHE'S TRYING.
OKAY, WHATEVER.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.044
LET'S JUST GET TO THE
STINK-EATING PART.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.718
THE WHAT-EATING PART?

16:28.088 --> 16:29.689
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

16:36.096 --> 16:39.299
HERE'S A THOUGHT, MY
HIP YOUNG BROTHER-MAN:

16:39.332 --> 16:41.168
TRY LOOSENING UP YOUR
YOUR KNEES A LITTLE BIT.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.142
YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:49.176 --> 16:54.081
HEY, I HEARD ABOUT ALL THE CRAP
YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.616
YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR
WIFE, GOING BROKE,

16:56.649 --> 16:59.352
LOSING YOUR CAR, YOUR CONDO.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.154
I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU EVEN WALK?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.692
OH, SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO...

17:05.725 --> 17:07.294
NO NO NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

17:07.327 --> 17:10.463
I'M AWARE THAT MY LIFE IS AN
ABYSS OF INKY-BLACK DESPAIR.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.332
THANKS FOR THE PEP TALK.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.039
HEY, COULD YOU SHOW
ME HOW TO DO THAT?

17:20.073 --> 17:21.741
ONLY IF YOU TAPED IT.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.177
- ( door closes )
- Mel: RYDER! JOE!

17:24.211 --> 17:26.713
OH, YOUR MOM'S HOME.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.186
I'M SORRY. YOUR... YOUR AUNT.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.688
I... I MEANT YOUR AUNT.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.227
- HEY.
- SO I ATE MY WHOLE BIG BOWL OF STINK.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.795
- WHOO!
- I EVEN WENT BACK FOR SECONDS,

17:42.829 --> 17:46.133
SO I'M GONNA GO
BRUSH MY TEETH NOW.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.137
AH! HANDS.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.139
IT WAS YOU?

17:52.172 --> 17:53.806
YOU TALKED HER INTO
GOING DOWN THERE.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.442
HOW DID YOU TALK HER
INTO GOING DOWN THERE?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.577
PEOPLE LIKE ME.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.380
- NO, REALLY.
- I PAID HER 50 BUCKS.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.682
A BRIBE?! THAT'S TERRIBLE!

18:02.715 --> 18:05.084
NOT ONLY IS THAT WRONG,
THAT'S HORRIBLE PARENTING!

18:05.118 --> 18:06.619
WELL, I'M NOT A PARENT
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.422
- CAN I HAVE 50 BUCKS?
- Both: NO.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.791
RELAX, ALL RIGHT? I WROTE
LENNOX A PERSONAL CHECK.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.627
BOING.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.630
ANOTHER VERY VALUABLE
LIFE LESSON.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.732
SO IS THIS HOW YOU RAN YOUR YOUTH
CENTER RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.101
OH PLEASE, THERE WAS
NO YOUTH CENTER.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.637
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

18:26.373 --> 18:27.674
- NICE KNOWING YOU.
- OH, I'LL BE FINE.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.543
YOU LIE, YOU BRIBE.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.844
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WON'T DO?

18:31.878 --> 18:34.347
WINDOWS. ( laughs )

18:35.548 --> 18:36.683
LOOK, BURKE,

18:36.716 --> 18:38.551
I'M JUST TRYING TO
HELP YOU OUT HERE.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.288
I MAY HAVE PLAYED
IT FAST AND LOOSE,

18:41.321 --> 18:43.756
BUT LENNOX APOLOGIZED TO
THAT LUNT WOMAN, RIGHT?

18:44.791 --> 18:48.094
YES. YES, SHE DID.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.230
SHE ALSO, AS IT HAPPENS,

18:50.263 --> 18:51.731
SAID A FEW NICE
THINGS ABOUT ME...

18:52.799 --> 18:54.434
IN FRONT OF ME.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.637
IT'S FIRST TIME SINCE
SHE'S BEEN HERE.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.240
FRANKLY, IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.675
OH MY GOD, YOU DIDN'T PAY HER
TO DO THAT TOO, DID YOU?

19:04.211 --> 19:07.380
NO, SHE GAVE YOU THAT
ONE FREE OF CHARGE.

19:07.414 --> 19:11.218
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE MY MERE
PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD

19:11.251 --> 19:14.187
THAT'S SORT OF SEAMLESSLY
PULLING EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.757
HMM. YEAH, LET'S BELIEVE THAT.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.460
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.230
A REGENCY NANNIES CALLED.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.398
THEY SAID MRS.
DIETRICH IS AVAILABLE

19:25.432 --> 19:28.401
AND THAT SHE'LL BE HERE 8:00 A.M.
TOMORROW MORNING.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.803
YOU DIDN'T THINK I COULD
HANDLE THIS, DID YOU?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.607
TO BE HONEST, NO.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.743
NOT UNTIL YOU...

19:36.776 --> 19:38.711
PULLED ALL THAT

19:38.745 --> 19:40.747
COMPETENCE OUT OF YOUR ASS.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.485
SO IS THIS OFFICIAL NOW?

19:45.518 --> 19:48.488
