The clerk at the tech shop said
that you bought the last one,

25:20.867 --> 25:25.219

shipment for a week, so...

25:30.572 --> 25:32.705
- Look, I'd like to help you,

25:32.748 --> 25:36.709
but I need
this X-76 power converter too.

25:36.752 --> 25:41.148
- You need it for some
important invention right?

25:41.714 --> 25:45.239

I'm throwing it away.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.763
- Uh...

25:47.807 --> 25:50.853
Ha, my son Chester
is working on a project.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.681
I've looked at his plans.

25:52.725 --> 25:56.032
Two days from now,
he's gonna need that part,

25:56.076 --> 25:58.034
but I'll be back
on the road by then.

25:59.470 --> 26:03.692
I'm throwing it away now
so that he can find it later,

26:03.736 --> 26:05.651
when he needs it.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.394
Do you have kids, Mr. Boyega?

26:10.438 --> 26:12.440
If you do,
someday you'll understand.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.749
- Wait, so why not just
give it to him?

26:17.663 --> 26:19.578
- It's my way of teaching him
to be resourceful

26:19.621 --> 26:21.928
and a problem solver.

26:21.971 --> 26:25.322
- It's kind of brilliant.
- I know.

26:25.366 --> 26:29.022
Plus, he gets the joy
of learning to see treasure

26:29.065 --> 26:31.285
where other people see trash.

26:33.113 --> 26:37.247
- Do you do this kind of thing
a lot for him?

26:37.291 --> 26:39.685
- Everything I do is for him.

26:39.728 --> 26:42.252
He's the reason I get
out of bed in the morning.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.610
But don't you ever resent

26:51.653 --> 26:53.655
having to work so hard 24/7?

26:53.699 --> 26:55.962
- I'm the boy's father...

26:59.618 --> 27:02.708
And Chester's worth
any sacrifice I have to make.

27:06.189 --> 27:10.629
Besides, when it
comes to him...

27:12.674 --> 27:14.371
I don't believe in quitting.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.161
- So you don't care

27:21.204 --> 27:23.163
about your work
more than your son.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.776
You care about your work
because of him.

27:27.820 --> 27:31.606
- I'm just a man trying to do
the right thing.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.174

27:41.877 --> 27:44.184
Yeah.

And I hope I can be
a great dad too someday.

28:04.030 --> 28:07.337

I guess I'm just a man
trying to do the right thing.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.679
Make my Pops proud.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.032
- Caitlin, hurry up.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.513
I'm trying to get this coffee
and a cronut.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.559
- Iris, thanks to you,

39:04.603 --> 39:06.605
I'm seeing things
a lot clearer now.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.217
Well, I imagine you two
are anxious to get home,

39:10.260 --> 39:12.350
so I'll see you in the morning.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.352
- Wait.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.223
You're staying here tonight?

39:16.266 --> 39:17.529
- Well, I want to know
right away

39:17.572 --> 39:20.270
if the satellites
find the other Forces.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.663
- Yeah, no, I get that,

39:21.707 --> 39:23.883
but we'll get an alert
if that happens.

39:24.710 --> 39:27.190
Nora, we have clean sheets

39:27.234 --> 39:30.193
in our guest room
and plenty of blankets.

39:30.977 --> 39:34.589
- Sounds cozy.
- Yeah, it is.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.113
You should stay
with us tonight.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.376
Right, Barry?

39:40.421 --> 39:44.382
- Um, sure.

39:46.079 --> 39:49.038
Yeah, of course.

39:50.779 --> 39:53.129
You have no idea how much
that would mean to me.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.435
Really.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.089
- It's our pleasure.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.807
- I got you, Pops.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.769
Time to finish
what you started.

40:39.872 --> 40:40.960
Okay.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.881

40:48.924 --> 40:50.926
- Oh, no.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.276
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.278
Is that damn time bubble back?

40:55.322 --> 40:56.932
- Oh, no.
I just liked the look,

40:56.976 --> 40:59.195
so I decided to swing
by a thrift store.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.589
Picked up these bad boys too.

41:01.633 --> 41:03.939
- Listen, we need to talk.
- Ugh.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.725
Nothing good ever starts
with, "We need to talk."

41:06.768 --> 41:10.424
- This new state liaison
that's auditing CCPD,

41:10.468 --> 41:12.121
her name's Kristen Kramer,

41:12.165 --> 41:13.906
I just found out
that she's here to catch

41:13.949 --> 41:16.212
a dangerous
fugitive meta-human.

41:16.256 --> 41:19.651
- Hmm.
- She's here for Killer Frost.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.917
- That's not who I am anymore.
- I know.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.963
I just got to find a way
to make her see that.

41:28.007 --> 41:30.618
In the meantime,
you need to lay low.

41:30.662 --> 41:32.054
- Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.

41:32.098 --> 41:34.230
- She's former
Army Intelligence, Frost.

41:34.274 --> 41:37.146
- I don't care if she's
Xena, Warrior Princess.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.584
I am finally free
to live my own life,

41:39.627 --> 41:41.977
and no one is gonna take that
away from me.

41:42.021 --> 41:46.155
So if this Kristen Kramer
wants to come after me,

41:46.199 --> 41:49.332
then I say bring it on.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.250

42:16.316 --> 42:17.665
