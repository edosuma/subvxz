01:00.661 --> 01:04.028
Fire.

01:15.711 --> 01:17.976
Aaah.

01:35.665 --> 01:39.659
Bugler, sound recall.

01:54.386 --> 01:56.854
It's over.

01:56.922 --> 01:58.914
It's over.

02:01.527 --> 02:04.496
Corporal Clemens, sir, from Masters'
Brigade at Dante's Crossroads.

02:04.565 --> 02:06.560
Who gave you permission
to come ridin' across

02:06.586 --> 02:08.493
the face of my command
yellin' like a fool?

02:08.536 --> 02:10.320
Have you got a message for
me from General Masters?

02:10.346 --> 02:10.859
Yes, sir.

02:10.905 --> 02:13.135
Deliver it.
That's it, sir.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.733
The war is over.

02:15.810 --> 02:17.560
Lee surrendered to General
Grant in Virginia--

02:17.586 --> 02:18.999
a place called
Appomattox Courthouse.

02:19.048 --> 02:21.644
When?
Three days ago, sir.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.059
Three days, huh?

02:33.130 --> 02:35.928
General Masters just got word
himself, Colonel Thomas.

02:35.999 --> 02:40.062
Our wires were down.
With your permission, sir.

02:40.139 --> 02:42.972
Rig up a flag of truce,
Blue Boy.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.839
Short Grub?
Yo.

02:49.381 --> 02:51.316
Let's go.

03:16.145 --> 03:19.444
I be a sergeant, sir.
Can I be of any service to y'all?

03:19.515 --> 03:22.417
I'd like to talk
to your commanding officer.

03:22.486 --> 03:24.476
Who be givin' orders today, Jim?

03:24.555 --> 03:26.490
Yes, sir?

03:30.563 --> 03:32.497
Major...

03:32.565 --> 03:37.025
I've just received word that Lee
surrendered to Grant three days ago.

03:37.102 --> 03:40.798
Yes, sir.
You knew it?

03:40.872 --> 03:43.102
We received the news yesterday.

03:43.174 --> 03:47.635
I don't think you understand,
Major. The war is over.

03:47.713 --> 03:50.547
No, sir.

03:50.618 --> 03:53.485
Are you telling me that
you intend to keep fighting?

03:53.553 --> 03:56.819
Haven't we just proven it?
But why?

03:56.890 --> 04:00.452
Because this is our land,
and you're on it.

04:00.528 --> 04:02.498
We're all Americans.

04:02.563 --> 04:07.970
Yes, sir. That's always been
the saddest part of it.

04:10.773 --> 04:13.139
Good day, sir.
Colonel.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.233
Thank you for your courtesy.

06:32.998 --> 06:35.432
Damn.

06:35.501 --> 06:38.026
Come on.

06:40.740 --> 06:43.335
Captain Anderson.
Here, sir.

06:47.248 --> 06:50.184
General Robert E. Lee
surrendered. Am I right?

06:50.252 --> 06:52.276
Yes, sir.

06:52.353 --> 06:55.689
That means that officially we
no longer exist as an armed body,

06:55.759 --> 06:58.250
yet everywhere I look here
today I see armed men...

06:58.328 --> 07:00.762
wearing uniforms
and flying the battle flag.

07:00.831 --> 07:03.322
Get it down.
Yes, sir.

07:03.401 --> 07:06.267
Jamison.

07:06.336 --> 07:08.269
Yes, sir?

07:08.338 --> 07:11.135
Take down the flag.
Yes, sir.

07:14.043 --> 07:16.878
All right, people,
now listen to me, all of you.

07:18.616 --> 07:20.983
We have about 2,000 miles to go.

07:21.053 --> 07:24.113
Seven hundred of them are between
here and the Mexican border...

07:24.190 --> 07:27.056
and through a Yankee
occupation army.

07:27.126 --> 07:30.528
We are not gonna give the lowliest
blue belly we meet along the way...

07:30.596 --> 07:34.034
any reason to suspect we're anything
but a band of homeless pilgrims.

07:34.102 --> 07:38.698
Until we cross the Rio Grande, arms and ammunition
will remain in the bottom of the wagons.

07:38.773 --> 07:41.866
You men pack those uniforms away
and wear regular clothing.

07:41.942 --> 07:44.240
The poorer looking, the better.

07:44.311 --> 07:48.408
Now, once across the border,
we still have another 500 miles to go...

07:48.483 --> 07:51.282
before we reach
a town called Durango.

07:51.353 --> 07:54.789
There we will be met by representatives
of Emperor Maximilian...

07:54.857 --> 07:57.656
who will escort us to Mexico City.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.888
Captain Anderson.
Sir?

07:59.963 --> 08:03.057
We leave at midnight.
Yes, sir.

Whoa.

09:30.929 --> 09:34.832
Ah, Mrs. Langdon.
My name is Benedict.

09:34.901 --> 09:38.737
Thad Benedict, late of Pittsburgh,
but now of Natchez.

09:38.807 --> 09:41.072
This here's my partner,
Jimmy Collins.

09:41.143 --> 09:43.077
Word's goin' around,
Mrs. Langdon,

09:43.145 --> 09:46.080
that you people are of a mind
to put your place up for sale.

09:46.148 --> 09:46.735
Is that right?

09:46.761 --> 09:49.108
I beg your pardon, sir, but
I'm the sister-in-law.

09:49.151 --> 09:51.746
I believe you want to speak
to Mrs. James Langdon.

09:51.822 --> 09:55.315
Ah, Mrs. James Langdon.
Thad Benedict is my name.

09:55.392 --> 09:58.692
I was just telling your sister-in-law
here we heard the place is up for sale.

09:58.762 --> 10:01.492
Is that right?
No, that is not right, Mr. Benedict.

10:01.565 --> 10:05.331
Aw, come on, ladies, we've come
all the way from Natchez...

10:05.402 --> 10:08.371
just to make you people
a handsome offer.

10:08.438 --> 10:10.771
Mind if I get down?

10:10.842 --> 10:14.940
Yes, she does.
And so do I.

10:15.015 --> 10:20.453
My father restin' over there--
he minds too.

10:20.520 --> 10:25.549
Well, well, well, well.
You must be Colonel Langdon.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.095
James Langdon?

10:30.366 --> 10:33.528
Well, uh, Colonel,
I'm here to do you a favor.

10:33.602 --> 10:37.663
Well, let's see now.
Uh... Langdon Hall Plantation.

10:37.739 --> 10:41.505
Ah, yes, here it is.
Fifteen hundred acres.

10:41.576 --> 10:44.510
Is that right?

10:44.578 --> 10:50.042
Six hundred acres bottomland, four hundred
in pasture and five hundred in woods.

10:50.120 --> 10:54.614
Two streams, three ponds with
a two-and-a-half mile riverfront.

10:54.692 --> 10:56.752
Nice place.

10:56.828 --> 10:58.853
Thank you kindly.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.592
I imagine the house could use
a little work, though, huh?

11:04.170 --> 11:06.105
It could stand it.

11:06.172 --> 11:09.472
Yeah. Well, I'll just
have a look inside.

11:14.747 --> 11:17.739
We just swept the floor,
Mr. Benedict.

11:17.817 --> 11:19.945
You understand?

11:20.020 --> 11:22.956
I'll give you 50 cents an acre.
That's my top offer.

11:23.024 --> 11:27.085
You buzzards, you come down here lookin'
to get fat on the misfortune of others.

11:27.161 --> 11:30.358
This house is not for sale.

11:30.431 --> 11:33.400
Not now, not next year,
not ever.

11:33.469 --> 11:35.903
Colonel, we are businessmen.
You're trash.

11:35.971 --> 11:40.069
Well, well. You're a right
plain-talkin' gentleman, ain't you?

11:40.144 --> 11:42.976
You hear what the man
said, Jimmy? Trash.

11:43.047 --> 11:45.311
All right, who's
gonna pick your cotton,

11:45.383 --> 11:48.317
and who's gonna plow up
all that bottomland out there?

11:48.384 --> 11:51.149
And who's gonna chop
the wood when it gets cold?

11:51.221 --> 11:54.418
Now, now, Jimmy. No need
to get uppity with the colonel.

11:54.492 --> 11:58.623
Sixty cents an acre.
Take it or leave it.

11:58.697 --> 12:01.825
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.335
If I was you,
I'd grab it.

12:04.404 --> 12:06.702
We're gonna get it
anyway, you know.

12:06.773 --> 12:10.834
We'll get the house and every last acre
of land when they put it up for taxes.

12:10.910 --> 12:12.971
Oh, I see.

12:13.047 --> 12:17.108
And, uh, how do you know it will
be put up for taxes, Mr. Benedict?

12:17.185 --> 12:22.120
You went busted outfittin'
that rebel regiment of yours.

12:22.188 --> 12:24.316
Now, what do you say?

12:24.390 --> 12:27.259
Sixty cents... or nothin'.

12:34.237 --> 12:36.796
Hyah.

12:36.873 --> 12:40.274
Hyah. Hyah.

13:12.179 --> 13:14.874
This belonged to
Granddaddy Langdon, Horace.

13:14.948 --> 13:17.941
I think maybe
he'd want you to have it.

13:19.654 --> 13:21.782
Thank you, sir.

13:36.538 --> 13:38.473
Little George.
Yes, sir?

13:38.540 --> 13:40.882
Bring along that anvil and as
many tools as you can carry.

13:40.908 --> 13:41.502
Yes, sir.

13:41.545 --> 13:45.447
Colonel, anybody goin' with us
talk that there Mexican?

14:01.167 --> 14:03.965
Why don't you
stop lookin' at me?

14:04.037 --> 14:05.970
I can't, Charlotte.

14:06.038 --> 14:08.974
I just can't
keep my eyes off you.

14:09.042 --> 14:12.443
Well, you make me uneasy,
Bubba Wilkes, so stop it.

14:14.382 --> 14:18.786
You know, I've asked you a dozen times
to marry me, and you've never answered.

14:18.854 --> 14:21.287
I'm too young to marry.

14:24.526 --> 14:26.926
No girl who looks the way you do
is too young to marry.

14:26.995 --> 14:30.261
Well, I am. If you don't
believe me, you can ask my daddy.

14:30.333 --> 14:33.736
Ask your daddy. Your daddy knows there's
no man better suited to marry you--

14:33.805 --> 14:35.739
Charlotte.

14:40.945 --> 14:43.732
Maybe you'd better go on up to
the house and help your mother.

14:51.643 --> 14:54.977
You're a good junior officer, Bubba Wilkes.
Thank you, sir.

14:55.047 --> 14:58.175
Don't let anybody tell you you're not.
No, sir.

14:58.251 --> 15:00.685
But as a young man...

15:00.753 --> 15:04.622
with a desire
for my daughter's hand...

15:04.691 --> 15:06.626
you're pitiful.

15:06.694 --> 15:09.027
It embarrasses me to watch you.

15:09.098 --> 15:11.623
I don't understand, sir.
You sure don't.

15:11.699 --> 15:14.863
You let moonlight and magnolia
blossoms go to your head,

15:14.936 --> 15:18.098
and you forget the real
purpose of your mission.

15:18.172 --> 15:20.107
Newby.

15:32.023 --> 15:35.116
Don't tell me
I can't resign, Joe.

15:35.193 --> 15:38.560
I volunteered into this outfit,
and I'll volunteer out.

15:38.629 --> 15:41.122
There's still a lot
of work to be done.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.499
Not for me, there isn't.
I came into this thing...

15:43.571 --> 15:47.733
three years ago with
7 5 volunteers, all good riders.

15:47.806 --> 15:50.240
Do you know how many
of those men are left?

15:50.309 --> 15:52.709
No, but I imagine
you're going to tell me.

15:52.779 --> 15:56.475
Well, if you'll look out
this window, you'll see ten.

15:56.548 --> 16:00.077
Two of them
won't make Christmas.

16:00.154 --> 16:03.784
I still can't understand what those men
have to do with you resigning.

16:03.859 --> 16:06.760
They didn't join the army, Joe.
They joined me.

16:06.827 --> 16:09.318
For three years
I've watched them fall,

16:09.397 --> 16:12.297
and not one of 'em quit
and not one of 'em deserted.

16:12.366 --> 16:15.303
Those that are left deserve
more than a pat on the back...

16:15.371 --> 16:19.604
from some newspaper editor, and
I'm gonna see that they get it.

16:19.676 --> 16:23.635
The army needs horses. Well, there's
plenty of horses in the Territory--

16:23.714 --> 16:27.810
wild horses in Arizona and New Mexico--
and we're goin' after them.

16:27.884 --> 16:29.264
And sell them to the army?

16:29.290 --> 16:32.313
We're sure as hell not gonna
give 'em to the army.

16:32.356 --> 16:36.624
All right. Write out a letter
of resignation, and I'll see that--

16:41.567 --> 16:44.034
You came in mighty handy
a few times.

16:44.102 --> 16:47.300
Take care of yourself.
We may need you again, John Henry.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.671
You'll have a hard job
finding me, Joe.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.531
Where to, John Henry?

17:14.603 --> 17:19.405
Short Grub, I've been tryin' for three
years to get you to call me "Colonel."

17:19.474 --> 17:21.409
Now it's too late.

17:21.478 --> 17:24.846
Where to, John Henry?
West.

17:52.579 --> 17:55.515
The barn's yours, Newby.
Yes, sir.

18:53.547 --> 18:55.674
Good-bye, old lady.

20:10.934 --> 20:13.061
How come you know they're
gonna get in here today?

20:13.137 --> 20:16.004
'Cause I told him
to be here today, that's why.

20:16.073 --> 20:20.011
Where do you think you're
gonna mail that thing, Solomon?

20:20.079 --> 20:24.414
There's a Pony Express,
ain't there? Somewhere.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.783
Still a long ways
to Oklahoma, John Henry.

20:27.854 --> 20:31.118
Anything could happen.
Not to Blue Boy, it won't.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.658
Come on, tightwad,
give me a chew.

20:33.726 --> 20:36.057
Wait a minute, Baker.
I've only got one left.

20:36.128 --> 20:39.189
Come on, give me that.
Hey, that's too big. Come on.

20:39.266 --> 20:41.360
Give me that.

20:41.435 --> 20:43.665
Give me that.
That's my last one.

20:43.738 --> 20:46.206
Come on now, Frank.
I gave you a chew.

20:46.274 --> 20:48.538
All right, I've had it.
Give me that, Frank.

20:48.609 --> 20:52.102
Give me that. Give me that.
Hey. Hey.

20:52.181 --> 20:55.549
Well, I'll be damned.
Lookie yonder.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.305
Hello, Two Toes.
How's your wife?

21:15.373 --> 21:17.499
Pregnant.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.374
What, again?
Cold winter.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.812
How are you, McCartney?
Mister McCartney.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.649
John Henry, the least you can do
after I come all this way is say hello.

21:27.721 --> 21:28.721
Hello, Mr. McCartney.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.843
I broke my butt to get here.
You can show me some respect.

21:31.893 --> 21:35.659
Your cookin' still as bad as I remember it?
You go to hell.

21:35.730 --> 21:39.028
You still got
that mangy old cat?

21:39.099 --> 21:42.068
High Bred--
finest partner I ever had.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.126
Cleans his paws
and buries his leavings.

21:44.204 --> 21:46.502
Lot more than
some folks I know.

21:50.146 --> 21:53.080
Any trouble?
No. Lost track of time, though.

21:53.148 --> 21:55.378
I reckon I'm a day early
or a day late.

21:55.451 --> 21:59.785
You're four days late, but they
don't know it. How are things at home?

21:59.855 --> 22:01.825
Bad, like everywhere else,
I guess.

22:01.893 --> 22:05.991
Yeah. Well, I guess
we better get organized.

22:29.089 --> 22:31.922
Don't lose
those two over there.

22:43.673 --> 22:46.267
Get 'em all.

23:13.373 --> 23:17.140
Take your time. I'll have
McCartney send you some grub.

23:18.878 --> 23:24.214
That'll be damn nice of you. I hope
I can do the same for you sometime.

24:06.766 --> 24:09.290
Tough way to make a few dollars.

24:09.367 --> 24:13.668
Fighting the damn war was
a hell of lot easier than this.

24:19.913 --> 24:22.610
Not too close, Mudlow.
Might be catchin'.

24:22.683 --> 24:24.845
It ain't right, you folks
holdin' anger on me...

24:24.920 --> 24:27.548
just because I wouldn't
join your blamed old army.

24:27.623 --> 24:30.717
Go on, get.
Just mean.Just mean folks.

24:32.628 --> 24:36.894
Charlotte, I'd like to talk
to you tonight after supper.

24:36.965 --> 24:39.797
After it's dark, you mean?

24:39.867 --> 24:44.066
All you want to do is hold me
and hug me and kiss my lips.

24:44.139 --> 24:46.234
Is there somethin'
wrong with that?

24:46.309 --> 24:48.971
Well, a young lady's lookin'
for a mite more these days...

24:49.045 --> 24:51.378
than huggin' and holdin'
and kissin'.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.748
She's lookin' for somethin'
a teensy bit more substantial...

24:54.819 --> 24:56.754
than periphery and trimmings.

24:56.822 --> 24:58.915
Like what, Charlotte?

24:58.991 --> 25:01.755
I've said all I'm gonna say,
Bubba Wilkes.

25:01.828 --> 25:05.662
Well? Will you walk out
with me after supper?

25:05.731 --> 25:08.699
Walk out? Walk out in these
dreadful swamps where--

25:08.767 --> 25:11.133
where I could get eaten
by a tiger or somethin'?

25:11.203 --> 25:13.763
Oh, you must've lost your
foolish mind, Bubba Wilkes.

25:13.839 --> 25:18.141
And it just goes to prove you don't have
any true regard for me whatsoever.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.147
A tiger?

25:56.787 --> 25:59.723
The first good grass
you come to, give 'em a rest.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.919
All right, John Henry.
We'll be back around sundown.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.930
Hyah.

26:23.650 --> 26:27.018
See'd your dust all day.
What you drivin'? Buffalo?

26:27.087 --> 26:29.455
Stage arrived yet?

26:29.525 --> 26:31.858
It's overdue. I ain't askin'
'cause I don't care.

26:31.928 --> 26:35.330
But if your name's Thomas, there's a couple
of popinjays waitin' inside to see you.

26:35.399 --> 26:37.696
They've been here
for two days now.

26:37.767 --> 26:39.961
I give 'em water the first day,
and they tooken root.

26:40.035 --> 26:44.202
Government agents?
I ain't asked. They ain't said.

26:57.487 --> 27:00.513
Are you the gentlemen
that were looking for me?

27:00.591 --> 27:03.391
You are
Monsieur John Henry Thomas?

27:03.462 --> 27:06.329
You have me at a disadvantage.

27:06.399 --> 27:09.890
I am Monsieur Pierre Petain.

27:09.970 --> 27:13.202
This is my companion,
Señor Luis Escudero.

27:13.274 --> 27:16.369
We have the honor to represent
the emperor Maximilian of Mexico.

27:16.445 --> 27:17.911
Oh.

27:17.980 --> 27:20.541
Won't you have a chair,
Monsieur Thomas?

27:20.617 --> 27:22.983
Well, thank you, no.
We're waiting for the stage--

27:23.051 --> 27:25.384
We understand
you have many horses.

27:25.455 --> 27:27.922
Is that correct, Mr. Thomas?
It could be.

27:27.990 --> 27:32.087
We have been authorized by the emperor
to purchase all you can supply.

27:33.762 --> 27:36.664
Well, I'm afraid you gentlemen
have made a long trip for nothing.

27:36.733 --> 27:38.861
My horses are going
to the United States Army.

27:38.936 --> 27:42.531
But, Mr. Thomas, we'll buy
the whole herd, sight unseen.

27:42.606 --> 27:45.041
Top dollar, if you
drive them to Mexico.

27:45.110 --> 27:48.477
All expenses paid.
Stagecoach is comin'.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.211
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Our army needs them.

27:53.285 --> 27:55.516
Pardon me.

28:11.005 --> 28:15.577
Whoa. Pedro Flats.

28:35.766 --> 28:37.699
Mr. Thomas?
That's right.

28:37.768 --> 28:42.295
My name is D.J. Giles, and this
is my associate, Mr. Ezra Parker.

28:42.371 --> 28:43.507
Howdy. This is Short Grub.

28:43.533 --> 28:46.128
We're out of the U.S. Army
purchasing office at Fort Clark,

28:46.176 --> 28:48.703
and we understand you have
some horses to show us.

28:48.781 --> 28:51.249
No, I have some horses
to sell you.

28:51.317 --> 28:55.117
Three thousand, to be exact, and it's
the best herd you'll find anywhere.

28:55.187 --> 28:58.384
Fine. Shall we go inside?
Thank you.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.987
We'll cull your herd
tomorrow, Mr. Thomas,

29:04.065 --> 29:07.296
as soon as our wranglers
arrive from Brackettville.

29:07.368 --> 29:12.303
I suppose that out of 3,000 head, we ought
to able to find 500 or so that we can use.

29:12.372 --> 29:15.831
Our usual procedure is this--
Just rein up a minute, Mr. Giles.

29:15.910 --> 29:19.175
You're goin' a little fast for me.
Do you mind trottin' through that again?

29:20.848 --> 29:23.943
Not at all. I said
that out of 3,000 head,

29:24.019 --> 29:27.455
we might be able to find
500 or so that we can use.

29:27.523 --> 29:29.956
You know, animals
that meet our specifications.

29:30.026 --> 29:33.757
Well, I have 3,000 for sale,
not 500.

29:35.232 --> 29:38.225
Well, surely you don't
expect us to purchase...

29:38.303 --> 29:40.600
just any old horse
for the United States Army?

29:40.672 --> 29:44.632
Well, now there just ain't
"any old horse" in this whole herd.

29:44.709 --> 29:47.040
You'll take 'em all or none.

29:47.111 --> 29:50.342
Mr. Thomas, I'm sure
you're aware of the fact...

29:50.414 --> 29:53.213
that, uh, times are hard.

29:53.285 --> 29:55.618
Maybe not as hard as you think.

29:55.687 --> 29:58.213
The army's not that hungry
for horse flesh.

29:58.292 --> 30:00.989
This country is going through
a period of reconstruction.

30:01.062 --> 30:03.153
Money is in short supply.
Hmm?

30:03.229 --> 30:06.028
Who can you sell 'em to
if not to us?

30:06.099 --> 30:09.626
Monsieur Petain,
hold up a minute there.

30:09.703 --> 30:13.733
Just for the record, what are you payin'?
Twenty-five dollars a head.

30:13.810 --> 30:16.210
Last month it was 35.

30:16.279 --> 30:19.305
But this month it's $25 a head.

30:19.382 --> 30:23.181
Well, these gentlemen have offered
to take the whole barrel, sight unseen.

30:23.252 --> 30:26.016
Is that correct?
That's correct, Mr. Thomas.

30:26.088 --> 30:29.956
And what's your top offer?
Thirty-five dollars a head, of course.

30:30.025 --> 30:34.088
You just bought yourself a herd.
And you can tell Maximilian...

30:34.165 --> 30:37.999
he won't find better animals between
Montezuma and the Canadian border.

30:38.069 --> 30:40.004
Just a minute.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.365
You're selling horses
to Maximilian...

30:43.441 --> 30:45.604
in preference to your
own country's army?

30:45.678 --> 30:50.173
No, I'm selling horses for $3 5
in preference to 25.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.879
You two figured to make
$1 0 a head.

30:53.954 --> 30:56.320
Are you calling us thieves?

30:56.389 --> 31:00.382
Well, Mr. Parker, yes, that's
a pretty accurate description.

31:03.729 --> 31:05.995
Wait a minute.
I didn't do anything.

31:06.066 --> 31:08.001
You should've.

31:35.133 --> 31:37.794
Read that message again,
Sergeant.

31:43.609 --> 31:45.839
"Eighteen rolling units
with men, women and children...

31:45.911 --> 31:49.439
"passed through Gladesville,
Texas, 1 0:20 p.m. this date.

31:49.516 --> 31:52.575
"Suspected Confederates.
Probable destination, Mexico.

31:52.651 --> 31:54.847
Detain, search and turn back."

33:00.195 --> 33:02.162
What do you make of that?

33:02.230 --> 33:05.962
It seems I've heard that bird
before, sir, at Missionary Ridge.

33:06.034 --> 33:09.732
And if I'm not mistaken,
that's a gray-bellied sapsucker.

33:56.290 --> 33:58.225
The river. Come on.

34:01.162 --> 34:04.393
Hyah. Hyah. Hyah.

34:51.652 --> 34:54.053
Get your weapons.

35:05.100 --> 35:09.937
Real sorry, Miss Ann.
We didn't plan things this way.

35:12.076 --> 35:14.168
Let 'em go, Sergeant.

35:15.981 --> 35:18.413
McClarty, Gibbs.
Turn 'em loose. Let 'em go.

35:20.351 --> 35:24.448
Giddap. Hyah.

35:34.834 --> 35:36.824
Sir, I don't mean to--
I know, Sergeant.

35:36.903 --> 35:40.531
But if I can't have the whole dog,
I don't want the tail.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.540
Yes, sir.

36:10.574 --> 36:14.135
We'll probably cross 'em
at the old monastery, Eagle Pass.

36:14.211 --> 36:16.975
Bon. Well, if we do not
see each other again,

36:17.047 --> 36:19.346
then we will rendezvous
on the plain at Durango.

36:19.417 --> 36:21.351
Bon courage, Monsieur.
Thank you.

36:21.419 --> 36:24.150
They are fine-looking
animals, Mr. Thomas.

36:24.223 --> 36:27.886
The emperor will be pleased.
I hope he is.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.691
But whether he is
or whether he isn't,

36:30.764 --> 36:33.494
you have the money there
when the horses arrive.

37:42.577 --> 37:44.638
What's troubling you?

37:44.714 --> 37:46.841
Cavalry's comin' from Fort Clark.

37:46.917 --> 37:48.850
Damn government agents.

37:48.919 --> 37:50.853
Can they stop us?

37:50.921 --> 37:53.948
Not if we get across
that river, they can't.

37:54.024 --> 37:56.890
Let's take 'em to Mexico.

37:56.959 --> 37:58.894
Let's go.

39:08.739 --> 39:11.708
Well, what are you waitin' for?
Stop 'em.

39:11.776 --> 39:14.075
Stop 'em.

39:14.146 --> 39:17.547
We'll be mighty proud to stop 'em,
Mr. Giles-- all 1 2 of us--

39:17.617 --> 39:20.552
just as soon as you tell us
how to go about it.

39:32.634 --> 39:34.568
Next.

39:34.636 --> 39:39.006
Mr. McCartney, when
are we gonna have some meat?

39:39.075 --> 39:41.064
Right now, if you want it.

39:41.143 --> 39:43.202
Belly cheater.

39:45.213 --> 39:48.377
High Bred, you know
what good food is, don't you?

39:48.451 --> 39:50.385
You mangy old cat.

39:50.453 --> 39:53.548
Hey, McCartney.
Mister McCartney.

39:53.624 --> 39:56.560
There's somethin' crawlin'
in these beans.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.061
Well, you can speak to it,
but don't play with it...

39:59.129 --> 40:02.065
or else the others'll want one
in their beans too.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.404
Hold that plate.

40:06.472 --> 40:11.910
Yes, sir, I can just feel
that money in my pocket right now.

40:11.979 --> 40:16.415
What are you gonna do with it
when you get it?

40:16.482 --> 40:19.076
Well, I had to give that
a lot of good thought,

40:19.151 --> 40:23.452
but I somehow ain't come to set
right down on the notion yet.

40:23.523 --> 40:27.119
I know what I'm gonna buy me--
some pack animals and traps.

40:27.195 --> 40:30.528
Whatever's left over,
I'm gonna get drunk.

40:30.599 --> 40:33.693
And if I ever sober up again,
I'm headin' for the Rockies.

40:33.768 --> 40:35.702
Well, that might be fine
for you, Whitt,

40:35.771 --> 40:39.366
but me bein' better bred,
I got higher ambitions.

40:39.442 --> 40:41.377
Like what?

40:41.445 --> 40:45.040
Like building a small library
under a big elm someplace.

40:45.116 --> 40:49.677
Me and High Bred's gonna go to St. Louis
and open up a little cathouse.

40:51.755 --> 40:54.519
Everything quiet out there?
Would you believe it, John Henry?

40:54.591 --> 40:58.393
I had to wake two of the men.
Let's hope it stays that way.

40:58.463 --> 41:01.523
You ain't expectin' trouble,
are you, John Henry?

41:01.600 --> 41:04.399
Trouble? Well, let's see.

41:04.470 --> 41:07.530
We got Maximilian on one hand...

41:07.607 --> 41:11.543
and Juarez on the other
and bandits in between.

41:11.611 --> 41:15.606
On top of that,
we're Americans in Mexico...

41:15.683 --> 41:19.484
taking a cavy of horses
to a very unpopular government.

41:19.555 --> 41:22.148
Why should we expect trouble?

41:22.223 --> 41:24.316
How come you didn't
tell us that aforehand?

41:24.392 --> 41:26.587
How come you didn't ask me?

41:53.059 --> 41:56.653
John Henry, there's a box canyon
about four miles from here.

41:56.728 --> 42:00.026
Enough forage to fill 'em?
No, sir, but there's enough to hold 'em.

42:00.098 --> 42:03.465
There's somethin' else.
I rode across two trails.

42:03.534 --> 42:07.231
One was wagons and horses.
The second trail was many riders--

42:07.305 --> 42:09.798
at least 40 and maybe 60.

42:09.876 --> 42:12.175
The second trail ran
just down the side of the first.

42:12.246 --> 42:15.043
Well, if you were to tell me
that a year ago...

42:15.116 --> 42:19.076
in Virginia or Tennessee,
I'd suspect ambush.

42:19.153 --> 42:21.179
It looked that way to me.

42:22.557 --> 42:25.152
Short Grub.
Yo.

42:25.229 --> 42:29.893
There's forage and water about
four miles ahead in a box canyon.

42:29.967 --> 42:33.833
Move 'em in there and
hold 'em till we get back.

42:35.670 --> 42:38.003
Where are you going, John Henry?

43:06.407 --> 43:08.375
I don't believe it.

43:17.351 --> 43:20.115
Pick up that bucket.

43:20.187 --> 43:22.213
Well, howdy, Sergeant Newby.

43:22.289 --> 43:24.689
Save your "howdy"
for later, Jamison.

43:24.759 --> 43:27.695
Right now let me see you
start currying that horse.

43:27.763 --> 43:30.629
Yes, sir.
Just like old times, eh, Newby?

43:30.698 --> 43:32.826
Just like old times,
Colonel.

43:32.901 --> 43:35.337
Riders approachin'

43:35.406 --> 43:37.532
Two riders a-comin'.

43:37.607 --> 43:39.541
Margaret.

43:43.213 --> 43:45.271
We have company.

43:59.732 --> 44:02.326
Good afternoon.
My name's Thomas.

44:02.401 --> 44:05.427
We're drivin' a herd
of horses south,

44:05.504 --> 44:07.439
just over the hill.

44:07.507 --> 44:10.568
I'm Colonel James Langdon.
Mr. Thomas, what can I do for you?

44:10.645 --> 44:13.614
Well, it isn't
what you can do for us.

44:13.681 --> 44:17.447
We came to warn you that you're
probably riding into a bandit ambush.

44:19.686 --> 44:21.985
Well, how do you
happen to know that?

44:22.056 --> 44:24.580
Well, Blue Boy here
is a full-blooded Cherokee.

44:24.658 --> 44:28.288
When he suspects somethin',
you usually get it.

44:28.362 --> 44:31.960
There's 40 to 60 riders
moving parallel to you,

44:32.035 --> 44:33.969
just out of sight.

44:42.881 --> 44:45.111
Waitin' until we get
into those hills?

44:45.183 --> 44:47.174
That'd be my guess.

44:50.223 --> 44:54.248
What did you say your name was?
John Henry Thomas.

44:54.326 --> 44:57.261
Don't I know you
from somewhere?

44:57.329 --> 45:00.491
To my knowledge, Colonel,
we've never met before.

45:07.774 --> 45:12.302
Well, we appreciate
the warning, sir.

45:14.414 --> 45:18.044
It's late. Will you and your friend
join us for supper, stay the night?

45:18.119 --> 45:20.817
Best offer we've had all day.

45:36.038 --> 45:38.303
There's nothin'
like a full stomach...

45:38.375 --> 45:40.810
for facin' the unknown future.

45:40.878 --> 45:42.971
Well, I hate to be
persistent, Colonel,

45:43.047 --> 45:45.982
but, uh, I think
the future is pretty certain.

45:46.050 --> 45:47.984
I fully agree.

45:48.052 --> 45:52.320
I think they'll give you a couple of days to
get up into the hills before they strike.

45:52.392 --> 45:57.159
If this was my outfit, I'd hold
right here and make them come to me.

45:57.230 --> 45:59.461
That's good thinkin'

45:59.532 --> 46:03.593
I've never yet let the enemy choose
the sight of his own destruction.

46:03.670 --> 46:06.832
I like to play in my yard.
What are these bandits after?

46:06.905 --> 46:09.602
Gold, horses... women.

46:09.676 --> 46:15.413
We had an experience or two
with 'em before the... war.

46:15.484 --> 46:19.250
Were you, perchance,
in the war, Mr. Thomas?

46:19.322 --> 46:21.256
Yes, Captain, I was.

46:21.323 --> 46:24.885
Would it be brash and
presumptuous of me to ask...

46:24.961 --> 46:27.191
which side you were on,
Mr. Thomas?

46:27.263 --> 46:31.224
Well, I favor to think that
I was on the right side, Mrs. Langdon.

46:31.302 --> 46:35.204
I detect a shadow of animosity
towards my question.

46:35.272 --> 46:38.297
Could it be that you
were a Yankee soldier?

46:38.374 --> 46:40.569
What a question to ask a man.

46:40.643 --> 46:43.977
Yes, ma'am,
I was a Yankee soldier.

46:44.047 --> 46:46.311
Mr. Thomas...

46:46.384 --> 46:49.786
I'm about to make my rounds
before I turn in tonight.

46:49.855 --> 46:51.982
Would you care to accompany me?

46:52.057 --> 46:53.991
Thank you, sir.

47:02.836 --> 47:07.434
I suspected it when I saw those
Union trousers on that Indian boy.

47:09.344 --> 47:13.279
My son was killed by Union cavalry
at Shiloh, Mr. Thomas.

47:13.347 --> 47:16.373
We called it
Pittsburgh Landing.

47:16.450 --> 47:19.112
You were there then?
I was.

47:19.186 --> 47:21.452
May I ask your rank?

47:21.524 --> 47:24.186
I was a colonel
in that cavalry.

47:26.697 --> 47:28.756
John Henry Thomas.
Of course.

47:28.832 --> 47:31.595
Well, you were on
George Custer's right flank...

47:31.668 --> 47:34.399
when you charged the breastworks
at Madisonville, weren't you?

47:34.471 --> 47:37.373
We did a job that day, didn't we?
You were damn cruel.

47:37.442 --> 47:41.379
Cruel? Those Johnny Rebs had 40-pounders
looking right down our throats.

47:41.447 --> 47:44.746
Did you think you
were comin' to a ball? Sergeant.

47:44.817 --> 47:46.751
Yes, sir.

47:50.455 --> 47:55.052
If I can find the time, I'm gonna sit down
and write the social history of bourbon.

48:00.568 --> 48:02.934
Tell me somethin',
Mr. Thomas.

48:03.004 --> 48:05.939
Were you, by chance,
at Chickamauga?

48:06.007 --> 48:09.204
I ask because I lost
my brother there-- Ann's husband.

48:09.277 --> 48:12.805
I lost 23 in my command
at Chickamauga--

48:12.880 --> 48:15.818
friends and sons of friends,

48:15.886 --> 48:18.479
men that I'd known
all their lives.

48:18.555 --> 48:22.185
Now can I ask you a question, Colonel?
Fire one, Mr. Thomas.

48:22.259 --> 48:27.423
Why did you come clear out here to continue
a war that ended months ago in Virginia?

48:27.497 --> 48:29.931
Because I'm a stubborn man.
Does that satisfy you?

48:29.999 --> 48:31.228
No.

48:31.302 --> 48:34.067
I got no taste for losin'
to a lot of Yankee rabble.

48:34.139 --> 48:36.630
How about that?
It won't wash.

48:36.708 --> 48:39.336
You can be a very
aggravatin' man, Mr. Thomas.

48:39.411 --> 48:41.641
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

48:51.559 --> 48:53.754
Let's just say
we haven't seen the end.

48:55.663 --> 48:58.755
You'll see it quick enough
if you keep drinkin' this stuff.

48:58.832 --> 49:00.766
Excuse me, Colonel.

49:00.834 --> 49:02.699
Sergeant.

49:07.374 --> 49:09.310
Help yourself.

50:02.365 --> 50:05.493
The young 'uns, now.
Come on over here.

50:05.568 --> 50:08.331
You get over here
with me right now.

50:08.403 --> 50:11.668
Hurry, now.
Get tucked away. Come on.

50:11.740 --> 50:12.873
Come on, now.

50:12.899 --> 50:17.432
Mind a suggestion from a
Platte River Indian fighter?

50:17.480 --> 50:18.967
Why don't you arm your women?

50:18.993 --> 50:21.967
That's what we did on the
Bozeman and California trail.

50:22.020 --> 50:25.079
Colonel.

50:28.727 --> 50:31.390
All our night pickets come in yet?

50:31.464 --> 50:33.661
All but Jamison, sir.

50:39.873 --> 50:45.003
Well, go get him.
Carlyle. Little George.

51:08.003 --> 51:11.565
It's Jamison, sir.

51:11.641 --> 51:14.372
All right.
Take him down, George.

51:30.230 --> 51:35.166
Captain, issue a rifle
to every woman knows how to use it.

51:35.234 --> 51:38.135
Yes, sir.
Carry on, Sergeant.

51:38.203 --> 51:40.139
Ladies.

51:45.281 --> 51:47.511
Colonel.

52:02.998 --> 52:07.801
Looks like he wants to talk.
We have nothing to talk about.

52:07.872 --> 52:10.834
Well, he's got you outnumbered.
Let's start from there.

52:10.860 --> 52:12.595
Finding ourselves outnumbered,

52:12.642 --> 52:16.010
Colonel Thomas, is a fact of life
we've gotten used to.

52:17.349 --> 52:21.151
With women and children
in the pot?

52:21.221 --> 52:23.882
I'll go, sir.
No.

52:27.125 --> 52:30.562
The colonel and I will go.

52:43.310 --> 52:46.507
Let's understand
each other, Thomas.

52:46.580 --> 52:49.572
Your Indian friend rode out of here
last night with no explanation.

52:49.650 --> 52:54.681
He hasn't returned. One false move
on your part, and my men won't miss.

52:56.493 --> 52:59.587
Friend, your men have been
missin' me for years.

52:59.663 --> 53:04.258
As far as that Indian boy is concerned,
his father was Bold Eagle,

53:04.333 --> 53:06.824
one of the bravest warriors
that ever rode a horse.

53:06.903 --> 53:10.738
And on top of that,
he's my adopted son,

53:10.809 --> 53:14.370
and I haven't done this much
explaining in years.

53:14.447 --> 53:18.110
Don't press me, Captain.
Anderson.

53:18.184 --> 53:21.017
Yes, sir.

53:33.301 --> 53:37.327
Windage and elevation,
Mrs. Langdon. Windage and elevation.

53:51.987 --> 53:55.446
Buenos días, señores.
Yo soy Escalante.

53:55.524 --> 53:58.050
Do you speak English?
Ah, sí.

53:58.127 --> 54:00.791
I speak English
most excellently.

54:00.866 --> 54:04.552
Then tell us what you want and
be damned quick about it.

54:04.578 --> 54:06.193
We want everything.

54:06.239 --> 54:08.968
We're so poor,
and we need so much.

54:09.040 --> 54:12.441
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What do you want?

54:12.510 --> 54:17.972
We want your wagons, your horses,
your guns and your gold.

54:19.919 --> 54:23.356
And you also
have some women, señor.

54:24.958 --> 54:28.690
Is this fool serious?
You can bet your life on it.

54:28.763 --> 54:31.697
But it's preposterous.
Yeah.

54:31.765 --> 54:33.281
I have more "mens" than you.

54:33.307 --> 54:36.388
If you wanna lose most of 'em,
you come right on ahead.

54:36.438 --> 54:39.066
Otherwise, you'd better hightail
your ass right on out of here.

54:39.141 --> 54:41.754
I'll fight a thousand of you
before I give you a penny.

54:41.780 --> 54:43.365
I was hoping you'd say that.

54:48.217 --> 54:53.520
Is the flap on your holster snapped
or unsnapped, my Confederate friend?

54:56.359 --> 54:59.295
Snapped, my Yankee friend.

55:02.234 --> 55:05.134
Well, I guess I'm his pigeon.

55:15.549 --> 55:19.041
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

55:21.889 --> 55:24.379
Colonel.

55:24.457 --> 55:28.791
You went out there to talk.
Why did you have to shoot the man?

55:28.861 --> 55:31.694
The conversation
kind of dried up, ma'am.

55:44.081 --> 55:47.346
Fire.

55:58.829 --> 56:02.265
Just like old times,
huh, Colonel?

56:05.837 --> 56:09.535
Margaret.

56:09.608 --> 56:14.239
Margaret.
 I can't.

56:39.174 --> 56:41.904
Colonel, behind you.

56:56.996 --> 57:00.454
Don't tell me they're leavin'.
No, ma'am.

57:00.533 --> 57:05.469
They're reforming to charge again.
Leastwise, that's their plan.

57:24.626 --> 57:27.492
I'll be damned.

57:52.257 --> 57:57.285
They're leavin' now, ma'am.
That's Blue Boy's little surprise.

57:58.830 --> 58:01.355
Well, I'll be damned.

58:03.269 --> 58:07.674
Mrs. Langdon, the colonel--
your brother-in-law--

58:07.742 --> 58:10.302
said you lost your husband
during the war.

58:10.377 --> 58:14.280
Yes, Mrs. Thomas.
I'm sorry.

58:15.549 --> 58:19.111
You didn't know him.
Why should you be sorry?

58:19.187 --> 58:22.883
My cavalry was
in that engagement.

58:33.435 --> 58:37.497
Colonel Thomas,
I wanna thank you.

58:37.574 --> 58:42.036
No thanks are necessary. They were
our enemies as much as they were yours.

58:42.113 --> 58:47.813
Their own people shoot 'em on sight.
We're in your debt.

58:47.885 --> 58:52.880
Colonel, why don't you take
all these people and go on home?

58:52.957 --> 58:56.290
There's no tellin' what you're
gonna run into farther south.

58:56.360 --> 59:01.526
In a day or two, we make contact with a
military escort from Emperor Maximilian.

59:01.600 --> 59:05.129
We are going home.
It's ahead of us.

59:06.706 --> 59:09.106
All right, Colonel.

59:24.160 --> 59:27.925
Who you wavin' at,
Blue Boy?

01:00:11.479 --> 01:00:14.177
Hyah, hyah.

01:00:25.362 --> 01:00:29.731
Wanna tell me all about it?
I was thinkin' about that girl.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.660
What girl?

01:00:30.686 --> 01:00:34.126
The Confederate colonel's
daughter, Charlotte.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:37.559
She's a pretty girl.
A little young, but pretty.

01:00:37.585 --> 01:00:38.759
I want her.

01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:41.778
You want her?
And she wants me.

01:00:41.845 --> 01:00:45.246
How'd you figure that out?
You raised me to know, John Henry.

01:00:45.317 --> 01:00:50.813
I taught you what to do when the snow
comes, how to survive in a blizzard,

01:00:50.889 --> 01:00:54.951
and I taught you how to deal
with men, but women--

01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:58.088
Nobody knows
what's on a woman's mind.

01:00:58.165 --> 01:01:02.034
Well, she wants me, and when
we go home, she'll be with me.

01:01:08.243 --> 01:01:11.074
Anything wrong, John Henry?

01:01:11.144 --> 01:01:13.078
Not yet.

01:01:15.016 --> 01:01:17.951
Yah, yah, yah, yah.

01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:39.945
McCartney,
give me a cup of coffee.

01:01:40.013 --> 01:01:42.981
Never mind.
I got his coffee.

01:01:45.984 --> 01:01:48.918
This damn cinch is
pretty near cut in half.

01:01:51.056 --> 01:01:53.719
Man's coming, John Henry.

01:02:04.204 --> 01:02:08.142
From Colonel Langdon, sir.
I'm to wait for an answer.

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:12.511
We're in a new camp waiting
for an escort from Maximilian.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:15.983
There's a map on the other side.
What's the matter?

01:02:16.053 --> 01:02:20.455
Ain't you Yanks
ever seen a live one before?

01:02:20.524 --> 01:02:23.754
Last time I seen a pretty
gray uniform like that,

01:02:23.826 --> 01:02:26.761
it was all full of holes.

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:31.495
Do you know what's in this, Sergeant?
Of course I know.

01:02:31.569 --> 01:02:36.029
There must've been a few words in that camp
before the colonel sat down and wrote this out.

01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:41.205
Yes, sir. A lot of words I thought
Captain Anderson was gonna have apoplexy.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.717
And how about you personally,
Sergeant. What do you think about it?

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:50.986
Well, it ought
to be right interesting.

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:54.584
Anything wrong, John Henry?
You won't believe it,

01:02:54.661 --> 01:02:58.325
but we've been invited
to a Fourth of July party.

01:03:17.955 --> 01:03:21.050
We'll be on our best manners today.

01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:25.272
Glad you could join us.

01:03:25.298 --> 01:03:28.484
Thank you,
Colonel, for inviting us.

01:03:28.533 --> 01:03:32.298
First time we've ever been invited
to a Confederate shindig.

01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:36.237
Well, I'm not surprised,
all things considered. Get down.

01:03:36.306 --> 01:03:39.277
Thank you.
Get down, all of ya.

01:03:41.348 --> 01:03:45.580
Well, we didn't intend
to interrupt the festivities.

01:03:45.652 --> 01:03:49.884
Well, what are y'all lookin' at? You
ever seen a Yankee before? Just people.

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:54.360
Start playin'. Captain.

01:03:54.428 --> 01:03:55.033
Sir.

01:03:55.059 --> 01:03:57.480
See that Colonel Thomas and
his men are taken care of.

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:58.386
Sir, I--

01:03:58.412 --> 01:04:01.825
They're our guests, Captain.
Make sure they enjoy themselves.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:03.771
Yes, sir. Wilkes.

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:09.243
I'm feelin' a little dry, Colonel. Would
you care to join me, or don't you indulge?

01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:12.075
Where's the sergeant?
I'll risk it.

01:04:12.147 --> 01:04:14.446
Follow me.
Thank you.

01:04:26.037 --> 01:04:30.500
You Yankee boys hungry? The captain
appointed me to tend to you.

01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:34.877
There's a mess of beans and ham up yonder,
and there's some coffee and grits too.

01:04:34.949 --> 01:04:37.349
Grits?
I wouldn't touch 'em.

01:04:37.418 --> 01:04:40.351
Why not?
Might be unclean.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.857
Well, it will be a change in cooking.
I'll drink to that.

01:04:43.924 --> 01:04:47.081
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right with you.

Thank you.

Mrs. Langdon.
Mr. Thomas.

01:04:51.667 --> 01:04:55.262
That's a mighty attractive dress.
French, isn't it?

01:04:55.337 --> 01:04:59.273
Yes. I bought it
in New Orleans before the war.

01:04:59.341 --> 01:05:02.903
Seldom had occasion
to wear it since.

01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:05.541
You surprise me, Mr. Thomas.

01:05:05.617 --> 01:05:08.609
You have knowledge
of ladies' fashions?

01:05:08.687 --> 01:05:13.886
Well, I was once married, and I have
knowledge of the cost of such things.

01:05:13.959 --> 01:05:16.006
Here you are, sir. A
little sippin' liquor.

01:05:16.032 --> 01:05:16.543
Ohh.

01:05:16.594 --> 01:05:17.167
Good.

01:05:17.193 --> 01:05:19.486
Somewhat finer than what
the sergeant provides.

01:05:22.199 --> 01:05:25.932
May you be in heaven half an hour
before the devil knows you're dead.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:28.873
To your health.
Jimmy.

01:05:28.941 --> 01:05:31.069
Excuse me, Colonel Thomas.
Certainly.

01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:34.808
Cousin Cora and that Sam-- Well,
they're havin' another go-around.

01:05:34.882 --> 01:05:37.510
Oh, shoot.
Would you excuse us, please?

01:05:37.585 --> 01:05:40.521
Of course.
Colonel, here. Help yourself.

01:05:49.497 --> 01:05:52.588
You said that you were
once married, Mr. Thomas.

01:05:52.614 --> 01:05:53.686
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:53.735 --> 01:05:56.499
But lucky for me,
she left me.

01:05:56.571 --> 01:05:59.974
I must say, Mr. Thomas,
that whatever your faults are,

01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:02.706
you do have a quaint kind
of honesty.

01:06:02.781 --> 01:06:06.238
Well, she was so busy being a lady
that she forgot to be a woman.

01:06:06.317 --> 01:06:10.014
It was Indian country,
and she didn't like that.

01:06:10.087 --> 01:06:13.718
It was cold in the winter, hot in the
summer and dusty in the dry spells,

01:06:13.793 --> 01:06:15.819
and she didn't like that.

01:06:15.896 --> 01:06:19.331
And when I wanna go huntin' and
fishin', I go huntin' and fishin',

01:06:19.399 --> 01:06:22.163
and she didn't like that.

01:06:22.235 --> 01:06:25.362
And I wanted children, and
she didn't like that either.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.941
She didn't like much, did she?
She's happy now, I guess.

01:06:32.011 --> 01:06:37.006
She's living in Philadelphia
with her cat, givin' piano lessons.

01:06:37.085 --> 01:06:39.815
Won't you sit down, Mr. Thomas?

01:06:39.888 --> 01:06:41.856
Thank you.

01:06:44.926 --> 01:06:47.896

01:06:47.964 --> 01:06:52.868

We're comin' down to the end of it now. We've
lost 500 horses between here and the border,

01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:55.673
and I don't think
that's very funny.

01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:59.779
We lose any more, and somebody's
gonna be damned uncomfortable.

01:26:07.431 --> 01:26:12.961
You know what?
I think John Henry's scared.

01:26:19.945 --> 01:26:23.541
How 'bout some coffee?

01:26:26.552 --> 01:26:30.215
Kind of worried about him, ain't ya?
Who?

01:26:30.289 --> 01:26:35.252
Well, you're the worst liar I ever came
across, John Henry. Blue Boy, that's who.

01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:39.233
Well, he should've caught up
with us three days ago.

01:26:39.301 --> 01:26:42.361
You don't reckon
he come across bandits, do you?

01:26:42.437 --> 01:26:45.701
No, I think
he's too smart for that.

01:26:45.772 --> 01:26:48.742
You know what I'd be
thinkin' if I was you?

01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:51.835
I'd be thinkin' he made off
with that little Reb gal.

01:26:51.912 --> 01:26:55.873
And I'd be thinkin' that he was just
about to the Rio Grande by this time.

01:26:55.952 --> 01:26:58.944
Well, that's what
I been thinkin'.

01:26:59.022 --> 01:27:02.720
Ah, he wouldn't do that.

01:27:04.093 --> 01:27:08.862
Nah, he wouldn't do that.
Thanks, Short Grub.

01:27:21.513 --> 01:27:24.880
I've changed my mind.
Oh-- Oh.

01:27:52.883 --> 01:27:55.645
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:27:55.717 --> 01:28:00.451
Well, here they are. You ready for it?
We're all set to make the count.

01:28:00.522 --> 01:28:01.248
Good.

01:28:01.274 --> 01:28:04.178
Did you encounter any
trouble along the way?

01:28:04.228 --> 01:28:06.959
Well, nothing to speak of.

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:10.593
Well, we're here, and the horses
are here. How about that money?

01:28:10.669 --> 01:28:15.232
Oh, it's coming... by special courier
with a troop of the emperor's cavalry.

01:28:15.308 --> 01:28:16.876
He is most appreciative.

01:28:16.902 --> 01:28:20.169
Well, how soon is that
special courier due?

01:28:20.215 --> 01:28:24.275
Any day. Shall we make the count?
Why not?

01:28:47.410 --> 01:28:52.314
2,505 horses.
I am surprised, Mr. Thomas.

01:28:52.382 --> 01:28:53.374
How's that?

01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:57.369
Well, I thought you would lose
more on a long trip like that.

01:28:57.421 --> 01:29:00.879
Well, I had an understanding
with my men.

01:29:00.959 --> 01:29:03.540
I asked 'em not to lose
any more, and they didn't.

01:29:04.496 --> 01:29:08.226
How long we gonna be here, John Henry?
Till they give us the money.

01:29:08.299 --> 01:29:12.201
My men haven't been home for four years.
We're a little anxious.

01:29:12.271 --> 01:29:16.174
So we won't be hard to find.
We'll be right handy.

01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:19.310
Company, halt.

01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:22.747
Left by twos. Ho.

01:30:25.821 --> 01:30:28.619
My compliments, sir.

01:30:39.203 --> 01:30:42.503
Colonel James Langdon,
sir, Confederate States Army.

01:30:42.573 --> 01:30:44.598
My aide, Captain Anderson.
General.

01:30:44.675 --> 01:30:47.905
My name is Lazaro Rojas.

01:30:47.977 --> 01:30:52.506
In the name of Emperor Maximilian,
I welcome you to our pueblo.

01:30:52.582 --> 01:30:56.348
We have prepared a welcome banquet for
you and your people, Colonel Langdon.

01:30:56.419 --> 01:30:59.117
Please, do us the honor...

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:02.684
of extending our invitation
to those of your party.

01:31:02.762 --> 01:31:06.163
Thank you very much, sir. Captain?
Sir.

01:31:06.232 --> 01:31:08.793
Lieutenant.
Dismount the troops.

01:31:08.869 --> 01:31:11.490
Yes, sir.
Sergeant, dismount your troops.

01:31:11.516 --> 01:31:13.263
Prepare to dismount.

01:31:13.307 --> 01:31:18.076
Dismount.
Ladies.

01:31:36.433 --> 01:31:38.698
Saludas, uh--
Amigas.

01:31:38.769 --> 01:31:40.828
Sí, amigas.

01:32:04.228 --> 01:32:06.494
Thank you very much, sir.
Salud.

01:32:06.566 --> 01:32:09.297
Ah, salud.

01:32:39.802 --> 01:32:43.295
It's all right, kids.
It's gonna be all right.

01:32:52.384 --> 01:32:55.786
Consider yourselves prisoners
of the Revolution.

01:32:55.855 --> 01:32:58.654
I shall protest this
to Emperor Maximilian, sir.

01:32:58.726 --> 01:33:02.093
We take no orders from
Maximilian, Colonel Langdon.

01:33:02.162 --> 01:33:05.724
Our president
is Don Benito Juarez.

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.667
The drums of Mexico beckon us, Colonel.

01:33:09.736 --> 01:33:12.034
Please.

01:33:12.105 --> 01:33:15.700
James.
Will you excuse us, Mrs. Langdon?

01:33:31.066 --> 01:33:35.903
If you think you're gonna scare us with
threats, General, you underestimate us.

01:33:35.972 --> 01:33:39.705
No, no, Colonel Langdon,
we have estimated you very well.

01:33:39.776 --> 01:33:45.509
Aside from the men in your party,
there are 3 2 women and 1 7 children.

01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:49.379
You are friends of Maximilian.

01:33:49.452 --> 01:33:54.222
He has brought the French into our country,
and they have tried to ride roughshod...

01:33:54.293 --> 01:33:56.227
over our people.

01:33:56.295 --> 01:34:00.822
Now Maximilian has brought you
Southern Americans into our country...

01:34:00.898 --> 01:34:04.892
because he can no longer
get help from Napoleon.

01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:09.535
These Frenchmen
kill the entire population...

01:34:09.611 --> 01:34:15.207
of a small village,
every man, woman and child...

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:19.342
butchered.

01:34:26.028 --> 01:34:30.228
¡Atención!

01:34:42.379 --> 01:34:47.750
¡Viva. ¡Viva. ¡Viva. ¡Viva.

01:34:49.307 --> 01:34:52.610
That is what happens, Colonel,
to invaders of my country.

01:34:52.657 --> 01:34:54.369
My people are not invaders.

01:34:54.395 --> 01:34:57.881
You are here, and you are
friends of Maximilian.

01:34:57.929 --> 01:35:01.280
But we're not your enemies. What
do you want of us, General?

01:35:01.306 --> 01:35:03.393
Our forces need horses, Colonel.

01:35:03.436 --> 01:35:08.534
Not far from here,
there is a herd of 3,000.

01:35:08.608 --> 01:35:11.442
Thomas.
Yes.

01:35:11.512 --> 01:35:14.241
Thomas.

01:35:14.314 --> 01:35:17.014
I'm afraid I don't
understand you, General.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:19.370
You will deliver this to Thomas.

01:35:35.104 --> 01:35:39.406
I'll be damned if I will.
I believe you will, Colonel.

01:35:39.477 --> 01:35:43.972
Our Revolution needs those horses.
Benito Juarez needs those horses.

01:35:44.049 --> 01:35:46.949
I'm a Confederate officer.

01:35:47.018 --> 01:35:50.682
You can't expect me to go beggin'
those Yankees for anything.

01:35:50.757 --> 01:35:54.091
That's in the first place, and the
second place, they wouldn't do it.

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:56.845
They have no reason to
care what happens to us.

01:35:56.871 --> 01:35:59.555
General, that man Thomas
would spit in my face.

01:35:59.599 --> 01:36:04.161
You will do as I say,
or you will all be shot.

01:36:06.139 --> 01:36:10.236
I'm not askin' any Yankee
for anything.

01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:12.608
Very well.

01:36:48.453 --> 01:36:50.580
General.

01:36:58.364 --> 01:37:02.165
I'll go.

01:37:10.713 --> 01:37:14.148
You will have the horses
in this place by noon tomorrow...

01:37:14.216 --> 01:37:17.082
or you will all be shot.

01:39:33.905 --> 01:39:38.170
Don't leave me.
Please. Don't ever leave me.

01:39:58.768 --> 01:40:02.829
All right. Get up. Get up.
Two Toes has dug up something.

01:40:02.905 --> 01:40:05.271
Come on. Get up.

01:40:05.342 --> 01:40:07.434
Mr.John Henry?
Yeah?

01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:10.707
Uh, we got company.

01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:14.682
Thank you, Mr. McCartney.

01:40:33.650 --> 01:40:36.586
What's all this?
We found this man.

01:40:36.653 --> 01:40:39.248
Found me?
You trapped me, you--

01:40:39.323 --> 01:40:41.256
Here, untie him.

01:40:41.324 --> 01:40:43.454
I told you that
uniform'd get you in trouble.

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.011
Yeah.

01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:48.120
Mr. McCartney, you got the coffee ready?
All ready.

01:40:50.934 --> 01:40:52.870
Good morning.

01:40:52.937 --> 01:40:54.872
Bonjour.
Buenos días.

01:40:54.939 --> 01:40:56.874
Wake ya up?
Ah.

01:41:01.179 --> 01:41:04.672
Get a little coffee in ya
and settle down,

01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:07.185
you can tell us what
it's all about.

01:41:09.557 --> 01:41:12.253
I was given no choice.
That's why I'm here.

01:41:13.528 --> 01:41:15.620
My family, they're all
gonna be murdered.

01:41:15.697 --> 01:41:17.788
All of my people
are in his hands.

01:41:17.863 --> 01:41:19.956
When we reached Durango,
they--

01:41:20.032 --> 01:41:22.501
they gave us a party
and then they tricked us.

01:41:22.569 --> 01:41:25.232
My people are prisoners
of a Juarista general.

01:41:27.342 --> 01:41:30.038
I didn't want to come here.
I didn't want to cause you people any--

01:41:30.112 --> 01:41:34.742
Aw, damn it. Here.
Read this.

01:41:34.817 --> 01:41:38.982
General Rojas
is more eloquent than I am.

01:41:40.957 --> 01:41:43.052
What does it say,
John Henry?

01:41:47.566 --> 01:41:52.525
That's good coffee. Thank you.
You really think so?

01:41:53.637 --> 01:41:56.835
Well... it's your game.

01:41:56.908 --> 01:42:00.309
How do you wanna play it?

01:42:00.379 --> 01:42:04.714
John Henry, we been dealt lots of tough
hands since the summer of'61 .

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:08.083
Here's one I wish we could pass.

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:11.886
This don't leave us nothin'.
We ain't never had nothin' nohow.

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:12.949
Wait a minute, Bobby Joe.

01:42:12.975 --> 01:42:15.819
You mean you're willin' to give up
them horses to them Johnny Rebs?

01:42:15.864 --> 01:42:19.130
Well, I ain't
no Christian, but my mama was.

01:42:19.201 --> 01:42:22.602
John Henry, remember
when I lost my horse...

01:42:22.671 --> 01:42:25.605
up there at Pittsburgh Landing?
Yeah.

01:42:25.673 --> 01:42:29.905
There I was without a horse, behind
that log and them Rebs was all over me,

01:42:29.978 --> 01:42:32.709
but there was one
didn't have no gun.

01:42:32.782 --> 01:42:35.717
Remember me telling you about that one
come crawlin' up to me behind that log?

01:42:35.785 --> 01:42:38.722
Yeah, but what's that
got to do with this?

01:42:38.789 --> 01:42:42.886
This Reb, he said he was all tuckered
out and he wanted to give himself up.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.753
So I told him to get the hell on
outta there. I didn't want him.

01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:48.625
You know what he said to me?
No.

01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:51.467
"You got me whether you
want me or not."

01:42:58.912 --> 01:43:00.845
All right.

01:43:06.152 --> 01:43:08.245
Looks like you're
stuck with us.

01:43:11.225 --> 01:43:13.160
John Henry, I--

01:43:13.228 --> 01:43:15.770
If we have to get there by
noon, we better-- Where's that--

01:43:21.436 --> 01:43:23.677
Short Grub, you better throw
a couple of outriders

01:43:23.703 --> 01:43:25.592
in front of the point
when we get started.

01:43:25.641 --> 01:43:28.110
Yo.
Break camp.

01:44:06.922 --> 01:44:09.515
...Durango.

01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:12.787
Y Benito Juarez.
Sí.

01:44:17.698 --> 01:44:19.633
Muy bien.
Allez.

01:44:49.434 --> 01:44:53.097
Crimeny sakes. Those Frenchies
have really found some help.

01:44:53.171 --> 01:44:55.538
I thought we'd run away
from all that.

01:45:01.548 --> 01:45:03.573
What about it, John Henry?

01:45:03.651 --> 01:45:07.280
Looks like we got ourselves
mixed up in somebody else's war.

01:45:07.355 --> 01:45:09.983
Yeah, it sure does.

01:45:10.058 --> 01:45:14.589
What are we gonna do now?
Well, that's already been decided.

01:45:14.664 --> 01:45:18.327
Bring the two chuck wagons up
here and fill 'em full of men and rifles.

01:45:18.401 --> 01:45:20.334
I'll get 'em.

01:45:22.572 --> 01:45:26.029
We'll give 'em a taste
of General Sherman's war.

01:45:26.108 --> 01:45:28.237
I remember.

01:46:23.941 --> 01:46:27.035
They're gettin' a little close,
ain't they, John Henry?

01:46:27.111 --> 01:46:29.841
Yep.

01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:38.818
You ready, Colonel?
Ready.

01:46:38.891 --> 01:46:42.419
Break to the sides.
Turn 'em loose, McCartney.

01:46:42.494 --> 01:46:46.989
Hang on, High Bred. Get out of my way.
Get up there now. Get up there now.

01:47:45.765 --> 01:47:48.666
Short Grub, take care
of High Bred for me.

01:47:51.906 --> 01:47:54.272
I said a lot of mean words
to the boys, ain't I?

01:47:54.342 --> 01:47:58.073
You sure have, McCartney.
Mr. McCartney.

01:47:59.581 --> 01:48:02.415
Well, you tell 'em
I meant every damn word.

01:48:38.125 --> 01:48:40.060
Aah.

01:49:07.424 --> 01:49:10.120
You. Two steps forward. Aquí.

01:49:11.227 --> 01:49:13.163
You.

01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:16.258
You. You.

01:49:20.073 --> 01:49:22.007
And you.

01:49:22.075 --> 01:49:24.007
You. Grandote.
Aquí..

01:49:26.611 --> 01:49:29.273
Mudlow. My turn.

01:49:31.183 --> 01:49:34.312
Hands back.

01:52:46.336 --> 01:52:48.270
Oh, ho.

01:53:24.613 --> 01:53:27.274
You have completed your mission,
Colonel Langdon.

01:53:27.348 --> 01:53:29.281
Thank you.

01:53:31.051 --> 01:53:33.382
Well, John Henry--
James.

01:53:46.469 --> 01:53:48.960
You must be Rojas.

01:53:49.038 --> 01:53:51.667
General Rojas.

01:53:51.742 --> 01:53:54.211
And you must be
John Henry Thomas.

01:53:54.279 --> 01:53:57.305
You drive a hard bargain,
General.

01:53:57.382 --> 01:54:01.183
War is war, Colonel.
You should know that.

01:54:01.253 --> 01:54:03.720
Yeah, ya...

01:54:03.788 --> 01:54:05.722
win one...

01:54:07.992 --> 01:54:09.926
ya lose one.

01:54:12.198 --> 01:54:16.498
It is cognac, the only good thing
the French have brought to my country.

01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:19.768
May I propose that we drink
to the health and success...

01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:22.603
of my President Don Benito Juarez,

01:54:22.676 --> 01:54:25.407
the Revolution
and the future of Mexico.

01:54:25.479 --> 01:54:27.414
Hear, hear.

01:54:31.854 --> 01:54:37.258
And, General, may I propose a toast
to the United States of America.

01:54:40.463 --> 01:54:42.554
Not even for 3,000 horses?

01:54:46.435 --> 01:54:48.962
To the United States of America...

01:54:49.039 --> 01:54:50.973
and the Confederacy.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.979
John Henry,

01:55:03.055 --> 01:55:05.490
what are that
Indian boy's intentions?

01:55:06.728 --> 01:55:09.286
Probably disgraceful, Colonel.

01:55:09.363 --> 01:55:13.068
But it's not what he'll do to her,
it's what she's done to him.

01:55:36.028 --> 01:55:39.328
It ain't much like
old times, Colonel.

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:43.995
No, it ain't much like
old times, Mr. Newby.

01:55:44.071 --> 01:55:48.098
What do you plan on doin'
once we get back home?

01:55:48.175 --> 01:55:51.633
Well, the only place a man can raise
more hell than he can in a war...

01:55:51.712 --> 01:55:54.579
is on the floor of
the House of Representatives.

01:55:54.647 --> 01:55:57.880
An old friend of mine once told me
people like to vote for heroes.

01:55:57.952 --> 01:56:00.046
So, I guess that's what I'll do.

01:56:00.122 --> 01:56:03.057
That team workin' out all right?

01:56:03.126 --> 01:56:05.787
Sure.

01:56:05.861 --> 01:56:08.592
You goin' back to the
Oklahoma Territory, Mr. Thomas?

01:56:08.665 --> 01:56:11.863
Yes, ma'am, just as fast
as I can get there.

01:56:11.936 --> 01:56:14.167
There many women out there?
Some.

01:56:16.807 --> 01:56:19.436
Good country, I suppose.

01:56:19.511 --> 01:56:23.002
From the Missouri
to the Pacific Ocean.

01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.674
Mostly good land
for farming and...

01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:29.584
raising cattle and
raising a family.

01:56:29.653 --> 01:56:32.588
Are you gonna raise a family?

01:56:35.628 --> 01:56:37.755
Well, I, uh--

01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:42.426
Solomon, can't you play any other tune?
Sure, boss.

01:56:42.503 --> 01:56:46.064
♪♪ That neither, Yank.

01:57:06.428 --> 01:57:10.833
Sure do miss Mr. McCartney.

01:57:10.902 --> 01:57:14.166
Yeah, but not his cookin'.
No, me neither.
