00:17.000 --> 00:19.600
Your aspirin, mademoiselle.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.000
I was starting to think
you'd forgotten about me.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.400
I was just looking for
a store that was still
open, that's all.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.700
Must be some headache.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.800
Can't even kiss your husband

00:40.800 --> 00:44.000
in the most beautiful city
on Earth.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.700
This isn't right, Kent.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.200
It's springtime in Paris.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.300
We're in the same room
we honeymooned in.

00:54.008 --> 00:56.500
Come on, maybe
a little Chardonnay

00:56.500 --> 00:57.800
will put you in
a better mood.

01:11.202 --> 01:12.709
To us.

01:19.609 --> 01:21.008
To us.

01:44.909 --> 01:46.003
You all right?

01:46.708 --> 01:47.902
What's going on?

01:48.306 --> 01:49.601
Were you dreaming again?

01:50.708 --> 01:53.801
An American couple in Paris...

01:53.806 --> 01:54.601
The wife ended up

01:54.605 --> 01:57.502
stabbing the husband through
the hand with a corkscrew.

02:01.006 --> 02:01.900
I don't know what to tell you.

02:01.906 --> 02:03.502
I don't think 'em up.

Three tenths...

02:56.706 --> 02:59.503
Two twelfths, whic
really one sixth.

03:02.305 --> 03:03.801
Um...

03:04.808 --> 03:06.002
Can you give me a clue?

03:06.007 --> 03:08.000
It's a math problem, doofus.

03:09.107 --> 03:09.802
So?

03:09.808 --> 03:11.601
So, there are
no clues in math.

03:11.606 --> 03:13.600
You either know
the answer or you don't.

03:14.006 --> 03:16.600
Mommy, I don't like doing
flash cards with Ariel.

03:16.705 --> 03:18.503
I'd rather do them with Daddy.

03:19.006 --> 03:19.902
Sorry, kiddo.

03:20.008 --> 03:22.400
Your dad is getting ready
for a big job interview.

03:22.907 --> 03:25.202
It's your sister
or nothing this morning.

03:27.205 --> 03:29.201
You ready for
a good luck kiss?

03:29.405 --> 03:31.001
Why don't you tell me,
do I look ready?

03:31.007 --> 03:31.903
Let's see.

03:32.206 --> 03:34.402
Ooh, you look good.

03:35.005 --> 03:36.601
Highly employable.

03:37.506 --> 03:38.500
Oh, yeah?

03:38.508 --> 03:39.401
Absolutely.

03:39.406 --> 03:41.501
If I was the president of
a big aerospace company,

03:41.507 --> 03:44.501
I would definitely
hire you-- definitely.

03:44.506 --> 03:46.300
All right. Okay.

03:46.305 --> 03:47.200
From your lips.

03:47.905 --> 03:49.500
Don't be such
a fatalist.

03:49.605 --> 03:51.503
I'm not a fatalist,
I'm a realist.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.400
I mean, aside from Aerodytech,

03:54.607 --> 03:56.902
aside from the company
that fired me,

03:57.408 --> 03:59.702
there are only two
other firms in Phoenix

03:59.706 --> 04:01.401
that do anything
even remotely related

04:01.408 --> 04:02.501
to the kind of work
that I do.

04:02.506 --> 04:04.602
And one of them
is laying people off.

04:05.207 --> 04:09.002
This may literally be the
last engineering job in town.

04:09.407 --> 04:11.400
That's okay.
You only need one.

04:24.508 --> 04:26.403
You're a brilliant man,
Mr. Dubois.

04:26.608 --> 04:28.401
I've been following your career
for some time.

04:28.406 --> 04:29.301
We'd be lucky to have you.

04:29.305 --> 04:32.001
And that would be that,
except that, for some reason,

04:32.005 --> 04:33.802
at this particular
moment in time,

04:34.708 --> 04:37.202
there are also two or three
other engineers

04:37.205 --> 04:38.601
who I expect we'd be
lucky to have

04:38.608 --> 04:40.101
and I've yet to meet with them.

04:41.907 --> 04:42.901
So I'm going
to have to ask you

04:42.908 --> 04:44.701
to be patient,
bear with me.

04:45.605 --> 04:48.901
May take me a week or two
to identify just who it is

04:48.907 --> 04:50.501
I'm going to ask to join us.

04:50.906 --> 04:52.700
Of course.
I understand completely.

04:52.707 --> 04:54.001
It's a big decision.

04:54.606 --> 04:55.800
For both of us.

04:56.508 --> 04:58.001
Now that we got that
out of the way,

04:59.306 --> 05:01.301
I have to ask you, um...

05:03.207 --> 05:05.003
kind of a peculiar question.

05:05.807 --> 05:06.802
Okay.

05:08.808 --> 05:12.102
Your wife-- she wouldn't,
by any chance,

05:12.508 --> 05:15.301
be the Dubois woman who was
on the news earlier this year?

05:16.305 --> 05:18.103
Why? Is that going
to be a problem?

05:19.007 --> 05:20.803
Depends what you
consider a problem.

05:23.205 --> 05:25.303
My wife followed
that story very closely.

05:25.407 --> 05:27.600
When I told her I was meeting
with you this morning

05:28.406 --> 05:30.302
she made me promise
I'd find out.

05:32.107 --> 05:35.402
Well, please tell your wife
I am married to Allison Dubois.

05:36.008 --> 05:38.202
And she is the woman that
they were writing about.

05:39.407 --> 05:42.400
Frankly, I take issue
with a lot of the things

05:42.407 --> 05:45.501
that were said, a lot of
the things that were implied.

05:47.608 --> 05:48.903
Well, it can't be easy.

05:49.406 --> 05:50.902
For you or her.

05:51.805 --> 05:53.801
For what it's worth,
my wife is a big believer.

05:54.608 --> 05:55.902
And her husband?

05:56.505 --> 05:59.602
Well, I'm a big believer
in my wife.

06:01.308 --> 06:04.300
Which brings me to
my next peculiar question.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.300
What are the two of you
doing this evening?

06:10.706 --> 06:11.701
Hey.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.302
Hey. How'd it go?

06:14.706 --> 06:16.803
Honestly, it's a little
hard to say.

06:17.505 --> 06:19.103
But I need a favor.

06:19.207 --> 06:20.203
So let me get
this straight--

06:20.205 --> 06:22.100
they're having a party
at their house.

06:22.206 --> 06:23.501
It's kind of
a charity thing.

06:23.507 --> 06:24.201
Tonight.

06:24.207 --> 06:25.502
I know, it's a
little bit odd.

06:25.505 --> 06:26.701
And your new boss?

06:26.707 --> 06:27.701
He's not
my boss yet.

06:27.707 --> 06:29.803
Right, not your boss yet--

06:30.105 --> 06:31.802
wants us to come
to this party

06:31.807 --> 06:35.600
because his wife
thinks I'm interesting.

06:36.308 --> 06:39.002
Uh, you make that sound
like it's a bad thing.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.800
Well, just so you know,
it feels like a bad thing.

06:42.905 --> 06:44.601
I'm not a freak,
I'm not an oddity,

06:44.607 --> 06:47.202
I'm not a science experiment.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.301
I don't even know what you're
talking about now.

06:49.306 --> 06:51.200
What is going to be
expected of us

06:51.208 --> 06:52.000
when we go to this party?

06:52.007 --> 06:53.503
What is she expecting
me to do?

06:53.906 --> 06:57.002
Do? I don't know-- eat,
drink, maybe be merry.

06:57.407 --> 06:59.800
And you're fairly sure
her idea of merriment

06:59.806 --> 07:02.303
doesn't include me sitting
in the corner reading tea leaves

07:02.306 --> 07:04.303
or telling a fortune or two?

07:04.607 --> 07:07.403
Allison, this man that I met
today, Pet Peter Barrister--

07:07.406 --> 07:09.401
he strikes me as a fairly
sophisticated man.

07:09.506 --> 07:11.803
I've got to believe that if he's
looking for party entertainers

07:11.807 --> 07:13.101
he has the means
and the wherewithal

07:13.106 --> 07:14.402
to find them on his own.

07:14.808 --> 07:16.501
I honestly think
that his wife

07:16.508 --> 07:18.401
is legitimately
interested in you.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.303
Which is another way of saying
that you are someone

07:20.308 --> 07:22.301
that she would love
to meet, period.

07:22.905 --> 07:24.600
Now, if you don't want
to go to this party,

07:24.707 --> 07:26.401
I guess we won't go
to this party.

07:26.508 --> 07:28.101
But I got to
tell you, finally,

07:29.207 --> 07:32.601
you doing what you do
and you being who you are,

07:32.606 --> 07:35.002
has the potential of
giving us-- giving me--

07:35.408 --> 07:38.403
a leg up in a situation
where I could use it.

07:39.106 --> 07:40.803
Now, he's interviewing
two other people.

07:41.105 --> 07:43.803
I'm betting neither of them
are married to a famous psychic.

07:46.408 --> 07:48.500
I'll tell Ariel that
she's babysitting.

07:50.705 --> 07:51.902
We need a signal.

07:51.907 --> 07:53.303
Hmm? What do you mean?

07:53.307 --> 07:55.600
Well, what if we do if
Mrs. Barrister corners me

07:55.600 --> 07:58.000
tries to get me, you know,
to guess people's birthdays

07:58.002 --> 08:00.609
or the future...
I don't know.

08:01.809 --> 08:03.108
Hmm, let me see...

08:03.709 --> 08:05.901
Why don't you just give me
that look you always give me

08:05.906 --> 08:08.500
and then I'll, uh, interject
myself in the situation.

08:08.506 --> 08:11.603
I'll know what to do.
What are you talking
about? What look?

08:12.407 --> 08:14.302
I don't know what look
you're talking about.

08:15.108 --> 08:17.001
You know, I think you're
intentionally being vague

08:17.008 --> 08:19.202
because you actually
find this situation amusing.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.400
Well, it's not amusing.

08:20.806 --> 08:21.802
Not to me.

08:24.105 --> 08:25.503
Yeah, that's the one.

08:32.607 --> 08:33.802
Oh, hi.

08:33.808 --> 08:35.303
Hi. Hello.
Hi, um...

08:35.308 --> 08:36.001
I'm Joe...

08:36.005 --> 08:38.003
Joe Dubois. Yeah, I recognize
your wife

08:38.005 --> 08:38.602
from the newspaper.

08:38.607 --> 08:41.503
You must get that
all the time.
Allison.

08:41.508 --> 08:43.001
I'm Bonnie Barrister.

08:43.006 --> 08:44.400
I'm so excited that you're here.

08:44.507 --> 08:45.202
Come on in.

08:45.207 --> 08:46.402
We're thrilled
to be here.

08:46.408 --> 08:48.700
Oh, please, come in,
make yourself at home.

08:48.707 --> 08:49.403
Thank you.

08:51.505 --> 08:53.901
There's a bar in the next room,
and there's food as well.

08:54.105 --> 08:55.503
Peter is around
here somewhere.

08:55.505 --> 08:56.803
I have to iron out
a few wrinkles

08:56.805 --> 08:58.903
with the caterer, but after
I'm through

08:58.908 --> 09:00.201
I plan on finding you.

09:00.505 --> 09:02.303
I'll be here.
Wonderful.

09:03.605 --> 09:04.602
Wonderful.

09:04.705 --> 09:05.603
You're not fooling me.

09:05.606 --> 09:06.900
That's not the look.

09:22.706 --> 09:24.003
I see you've been abandoned.

09:25.706 --> 09:29.502
Uh, no, he's just...
hunting and gathering.

09:29.707 --> 09:30.601
Oh, my.

09:30.905 --> 09:32.801
Does that make my
husband his prey?

09:34.505 --> 09:35.802
I hope Chardonnay's okay.

09:36.806 --> 09:37.603
Thank you.

09:39.308 --> 09:40.102
For what it's worth,

09:40.108 --> 09:42.401
ow Peter's very taken
with your husband.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.902
Not just because
I'm taken with you.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.903
I have to be honest
with you, Allison.

09:50.308 --> 09:51.900
I don't know how
you can live with it.

09:53.605 --> 09:54.903
I'm sorry. Live with what?

09:55.305 --> 09:57.902
With this city
and the people in it.

09:58.607 --> 09:59.803
The way they treated you,

10:00.406 --> 10:02.201
the way they treated
the district attorney.

10:03.006 --> 10:04.803
I followed that story
like a hawk.

10:05.407 --> 10:07.503
You said that that man,
Walter Paxton,

10:07.508 --> 10:09.500
murdered his wife and he did.

10:09.705 --> 10:11.601
You said that the reporter,
P.D. McCall,

10:11.607 --> 10:13.902
would get killed,
and she was.

10:14.107 --> 10:17.003
And you found the evidence
to put Paxton away, you did.

10:17.608 --> 10:19.600
And then it was as if
it never happened.

10:19.805 --> 10:21.500
The district attorney was gone,

10:22.206 --> 10:23.300
and you were treated
in the press

10:23.307 --> 10:24.700
like some kind of pariah.

10:25.008 --> 10:27.102
Or worse--
some kind of nut.

10:28.306 --> 10:31.402
But you were right
about everything.

10:33.708 --> 10:34.802
Thank you.

10:38.006 --> 10:39.602
Oh, there's Melissa.

10:40.305 --> 10:41.703
Have you met
my daughter Melissa?

10:41.907 --> 10:43.500
No, I don't believe I have.

10:43.506 --> 10:46.202
Oh, I would love for her
to meet you.

10:46.805 --> 10:48.202
She's listened to me
talk about you

10:48.206 --> 10:49.600
for quite a while now.

10:50.308 --> 10:52.202
And besides, she's getting
married next month.

10:52.308 --> 10:54.403
Oh, congratulations.

10:55.206 --> 10:57.702
She is gonna get such
a kick out of this.

10:57.706 --> 10:59.602
Just let me know
if you have any
premonitions.

10:59.808 --> 11:01.100
Oh, what do you mean?

11:01.205 --> 11:04.003
Oh, wedding-day disasters, um,

11:04.706 --> 11:05.900
how many grandkids I can expect,

11:05.905 --> 11:06.902
that kind of thing.

11:06.906 --> 11:09.800
Bonnie, I need to let you know
it doesn't really work that way.

11:10.206 --> 11:11.703
I'm joking, Allison.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.701
I know she's here somewhere.

11:17.905 --> 11:19.802
Oh, here's Melissa,

11:20.108 --> 11:21.203
right over there.

11:36.607 --> 11:37.802
Don't do this.

11:37.908 --> 11:39.700
Oh, my God, how do I not?

11:40.008 --> 11:40.600
How do you not?

11:40.607 --> 11:42.801
Al, come on! You're talking
about something that,

11:42.807 --> 11:45.103
if it happens at all,
probably won't happen for years.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.802
I mean, look at her.
She's fine now.

11:49.005 --> 11:50.203
She's happy now.

11:51.006 --> 11:51.700
She's not in Paris.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.303
She's nowhere near
a corkscrew.

11:53.705 --> 11:55.101
Hell, she's not even
married yet.

11:55.306 --> 11:57.303
What's the harm
in just letting her
enjoy this party?

11:59.705 --> 12:00.802
Are we in agreement?

12:01.207 --> 12:02.602
Are we in agreement
about what?

12:02.608 --> 12:04.900
About not saying anything--
not tonight.

12:04.907 --> 12:07.400
'Cause I really don't think
that's gonna help my cause.

12:07.407 --> 12:08.302
Allison,

12:09.007 --> 12:11.001
you took off so suddenly.
Are you okay?

12:12.507 --> 12:14.003
Yeah. Uh, no.

12:14.207 --> 12:16.603
I get headaches
sometimes.

12:17.506 --> 12:18.402
Well, if you'd like,

12:18.408 --> 12:20.002
I'm sure we have some aspirin
upstairs.

12:20.005 --> 12:21.403
Oh, no, no.
I'm fine.

12:29.106 --> 12:31.802
Bonnie, who...

12:31.808 --> 12:34.402
who's that man
with Melissa?

12:34.706 --> 12:35.702
Oh, that?

12:36.306 --> 12:38.702
That's Steven,
Melissa's fiance.

12:39.405 --> 12:40.900
That's her fiance?

12:43.507 --> 12:45.500
This isn't right, Kent.

12:46.008 --> 12:47.503
Okay, wait, wait.
Who's Kent?

12:47.806 --> 12:49.901
I overheard somebody earlier
mention a Kent.

12:50.506 --> 12:54.202
Oh, Kent. God, no. Kent was
Melissa's first husband.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.703
She was married before?

12:57.205 --> 13:00.301
Three years.
Three horrible years.

13:02.005 --> 13:03.500
They didn't happen,
by any chance,

13:03.506 --> 13:05.500
to have honeymooned
in Paris?

13:07.005 --> 13:08.403
That's very good.

13:10.105 --> 13:11.400
Isn't she something?

13:15.005 --> 13:16.400
Come on,
admit it.

13:18.306 --> 13:20.901
That was the most fun
you've had with your clothes on

13:20.908 --> 13:22.302
in a very long time.

13:22.505 --> 13:24.701
Don't push your luck, buster.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.601
You don't fool me,
uh-uh.

13:29.206 --> 13:31.001
I saw smiles.

13:31.908 --> 13:34.800
I saw phone numbers
being exchanged

13:34.805 --> 13:36.602
and I saw
a kiss good-bye.

13:36.906 --> 13:37.700
All right.

13:39.408 --> 13:42.003
I was just trying
to help my deadbeat
husband get a job.

13:42.006 --> 13:43.602
Yeah? Well, all right.

13:43.908 --> 13:46.101
Methinks she doth
protest too much.

13:46.807 --> 13:48.600
Okay, I admit it.

13:49.806 --> 13:51.000
I liked her.

13:51.608 --> 13:52.901
She wasn't
what I expected.

13:52.905 --> 13:56.700
She was smart
and she was nice
and she liked me.

13:57.605 --> 13:58.801
Bingo.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.400
Isn't that every one

14:00.408 --> 14:02.803
of your minimum
requirements for
friendship?

14:03.005 --> 14:04.802
Yeah, I'm pretty easy,
aren't I?

14:04.906 --> 14:06.600
I liked
the husband, too.

14:06.905 --> 14:09.401
In fact, I even
like the daughter.

14:09.806 --> 14:11.002
I know. She seemed
rather pleasant

14:11.005 --> 14:14.302
for somebody given
to impaling her exes.

14:17.008 --> 14:20.401
Whatever she was going through,
whatever drove her to do that

14:20.408 --> 14:22.200
to her first husband,

14:22.305 --> 14:24.700
it seemed like she put it
all behind her.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.403
It seemed like it was
ancient history.

14:27.608 --> 14:28.801
Yeah.

14:29.906 --> 14:31.103
Thank you.

14:31.308 --> 14:32.303
For what?

14:33.306 --> 14:34.501
For going.

14:36.206 --> 14:38.100
Peter took me aside
and he said that he wants

14:38.108 --> 14:40.403
to have a second interview
with me tomorrow.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.001
You're kidding!

14:42.007 --> 14:43.503
When were you gonna tell me?

14:43.507 --> 14:46.403
I don't know. I think I was
afraid to say it out loud.

14:46.606 --> 14:48.102
I think I was afraid to jinx it.

14:49.207 --> 14:51.902
I think I want this job
very badly.

14:53.305 --> 14:55.500
I think
you're gonna get this job.

14:55.607 --> 14:58.302
Do you mean you know
that I'm gonna get this job?

14:59.006 --> 15:00.602
I don't know anything.

15:01.606 --> 15:03.802
I just think that there's
nobody who deserves it

15:03.808 --> 15:05.300
more than you do.

15:06.007 --> 15:08.102
Bingo.
You just met every one

15:08.105 --> 15:10.802
of my minimum requirements
for friendship.

15:11.106 --> 15:12.300
Hmm, cool.

15:12.306 --> 15:13.400
Hmm.

15:20.706 --> 15:21.301
Mm...

15:47.905 --> 15:49.601
I didn't want to
hurt you, Kent...

15:52.005 --> 15:53.800
...but I'm not gonna
pretend anymore.

15:54.605 --> 15:57.400
I'm not gonna keep
playing this game with you.

15:58.407 --> 16:00.301
This whole thing
was a mistake.

16:00.307 --> 16:01.202
Yeah?

16:02.807 --> 16:04.301
I'm starting to sense that.

16:05.805 --> 16:08.603
Paris was a bad idea.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.803
Maybe I should have gone
with the cabin--

16:16.105 --> 16:17.603
our secret hideaway--

16:19.106 --> 16:20.901
but I know how much
you love that place.

16:23.606 --> 16:25.100
I'm not mad, Melissa,

16:26.105 --> 16:27.301
I swear.

16:28.606 --> 16:30.200
I just want you
to put that down

16:30.505 --> 16:32.901
before you hurt yourself,
all right?

16:35.605 --> 16:37.102
It's okay, honey.

16:52.408 --> 16:53.500
It's okay.

16:57.906 --> 16:59.700
We made it through
so much before.

17:01.308 --> 17:03.002
We're gonna make it
through this, too.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.203
I still love you.

17:08.906 --> 17:09.903
Ooh!

17:11.007 --> 17:12.801
You okay?
Is everything
all right?

17:12.805 --> 17:14.002
Oh, yeah, yeah...

17:14.007 --> 17:16.101
No, no, it's nothing.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.202
I'm fine.

17:19.707 --> 17:21.500
Just more ancient history.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.203
It's... nothing.

17:30.108 --> 17:31.103
Hello.

17:31.805 --> 17:33.703
Dad, it's for you!

17:35.905 --> 17:36.800
Hello.

17:38.505 --> 17:39.902
Hi, Peter.

17:41.506 --> 17:42.600
We have three kids.

17:42.606 --> 17:44.302
There's no such thing
as too early.

17:45.507 --> 17:47.702
"Family crisis,"
that's all he said?

17:47.808 --> 17:48.803
That's it.

17:49.106 --> 17:51.000
That and "Is there any
way that you and Allison

17:51.007 --> 17:52.201
can come up
to the house?"

17:57.308 --> 18:00.300
Oh, Allison, Joe, I can't
thank you enough for coming.

18:00.306 --> 18:01.703
It's been
a rough morning.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.901
My daughter and future
son-in-law live in Los Angeles.

18:06.205 --> 18:08.901
As it happens,
Steven had to fly back

18:08.908 --> 18:10.000
after the party
last night.

18:10.008 --> 18:11.202
Some kind of a
emergency meeting

18:11.208 --> 18:12.603
with one of his clients
this morning.

18:12.608 --> 18:14.603
Melissa was going to spend
a few more nights,

18:14.605 --> 18:17.003
finalize all the wedding
plans with me, but...

18:17.208 --> 18:18.902
When we went out

18:18.905 --> 18:20.900
to the guest house to get
Melissa for breakfast,

18:20.908 --> 18:22.301
the guest house was empty.

18:23.305 --> 18:24.902
Her things were gone,
so was she.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.402
And I found
this message

18:27.406 --> 18:29.901
on my phone: "Mom,
I hate to do this to you,

18:29.905 --> 18:31.100
"but I need some time
to think.

18:31.108 --> 18:33.203
"I'm just not sure
that I can go through
with the wedding.

18:33.206 --> 18:34.502
"Please, don't try
to find me.

18:34.507 --> 18:36.402
I'll keep in touch
en I can."

18:37.206 --> 18:38.800
Does her fiance know?

18:39.008 --> 18:40.603
I called him right before
I called you.

18:41.105 --> 18:42.702
He's a mess.

18:44.206 --> 18:44.903
I called the police.

18:44.908 --> 18:46.202
Of course, she's an adult.

18:46.207 --> 18:48.101
She's allowed to come and go
as she pleases.

18:48.508 --> 18:49.502
Allison, I...

18:49.806 --> 18:52.002
I don't mean to put you
on the spot, but...

18:53.108 --> 18:54.502
I know from all the articles
I've read

18:54.508 --> 18:57.502
that you've helped the police
find missing people before.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.102
You dream about them, right?

19:01.107 --> 19:02.102
Yes, but...

19:02.105 --> 19:03.403
I thought
if you found her,

19:03.506 --> 19:04.700
I could talk some sense
into her,

19:04.707 --> 19:06.502
convince her that she's making
a terrible mistake.

19:06.508 --> 19:07.900
She's done this before--

19:08.007 --> 19:09.802
run away when
there's a lot
of pressure.

19:10.405 --> 19:11.602
Bonnie, but what I need you

19:11.607 --> 19:14.903
to understand is the impressions
I get, the things that I see,

19:15.408 --> 19:17.700
I can't count on them to
point me toward your daughter

19:17.706 --> 19:19.301
just because I want them to.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.101
Look, uh, true confession time.

19:23.105 --> 19:26.603
I'm fundamentally a skeptic
about these sorts of things.

19:27.305 --> 19:28.202
I've already been
on the phone

19:28.207 --> 19:30.000
with a number of
private investigators.

19:33.805 --> 19:34.703
Having said that,

19:34.708 --> 19:36.200
we obviouslyant
to make sure

19:36.208 --> 19:37.400
we've left no
stone unturned.

19:38.606 --> 19:42.102
Allison, I promise you,
if you come up empty,

19:42.305 --> 19:43.900
if you come up dry,
I'll understand.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.900
I mean, you only
just met her last night,

19:46.008 --> 19:46.901
and briefly at that.

19:46.905 --> 19:48.600
I really do understand.

19:49.206 --> 19:51.501
I mean, it's not like
you've been dreaming
about her.

19:51.508 --> 19:53.103
It's not like she's on

19:53.108 --> 19:54.801
your wavelength
or anything.

20:00.508 --> 20:02.100
I mean, what else could I say?

20:03.308 --> 20:06.100
She's desperate, and so nice.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.702
<i>I have been dreaming
about her daughter. I have.</i>

20:10.508 --> 20:12.001
And you're trying to get
a job from her husband.

20:12.008 --> 20:13.800
And I just... I... I didn't feel

20:13.806 --> 20:15.900
<i>like there was anything else
I could say.</i>

20:16.907 --> 20:18.303
I mean, it's true.

20:18.307 --> 20:19.800
All the dreams
I've had about her

20:19.808 --> 20:20.801
have been about her past.

20:20.806 --> 20:23.602
But still, I mean,
what else could I say?

20:23.606 --> 20:25.703
You said the only
thing you could say.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.203
Thank you.

20:27.205 --> 20:28.302
And, just remember,
if we ever hope

20:28.307 --> 20:29.802
to send our three
girls to college,

20:30.308 --> 20:31.901
you damn well
better find her.

20:36.406 --> 20:37.402
Okay. How about this?

20:37.407 --> 20:39.103
Is it possible
that you've dreaming about Paris

20:39.108 --> 20:41.500
because that's
where Melissa's run off to?

20:41.506 --> 20:42.702
That makes no sense.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.401
Makes sense to me.
Oh, come on.

20:44.406 --> 20:45.803
What woman in her right mind

20:45.806 --> 20:48.401
would go to the place where
her first marriage fell apart

20:48.607 --> 20:50.903
to figure out whether or not
to get married a second time?

20:51.605 --> 20:52.601
Moving on.

20:53.508 --> 20:55.703
What else do you remember
from that first dream?

20:56.405 --> 20:57.603
Well, she was upset.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.601
She didn't want to be there--
Paris, I mean.

20:59.908 --> 21:00.802
That's it?

21:01.608 --> 21:02.402
That's it.

21:02.606 --> 21:04.003
He poured her a glass of wine,

21:04.008 --> 21:06.200
she stabbed him through
the hand with a corkscrew.

21:06.305 --> 21:07.502
Those are the highlights.

21:09.905 --> 21:10.702
What?

21:10.807 --> 21:11.400
That's all right.

21:11.408 --> 21:13.002
I didn't want
to work there, anyway.

21:14.008 --> 21:15.202
All right, that's not fair.

21:15.606 --> 21:17.701
It's not my fault
that the dreams I'm having

21:17.708 --> 21:19.602
have nothing to do
with where she is now.

21:20.105 --> 21:21.903
The second one
same as the first?

21:22.008 --> 21:24.800
Yes. Second one
same as the first.

21:25.507 --> 21:27.100
Corkscrew through hand.

21:27.106 --> 21:28.800
Smashed bottle against wall.

21:29.005 --> 21:30.302
Sounds romantic.

21:30.808 --> 21:32.503
She said that Paris
had been a mistake.

21:32.505 --> 21:34.100
He said they should
have gone to the cabin.

21:35.607 --> 21:36.403
What?

21:38.306 --> 21:40.903
He called it
their secret hideaway.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.802
The cabin.
That's what he called it.

21:42.808 --> 21:45.400
Did either of them happen
to mention where it was?

21:47.608 --> 21:49.002
I'm going to call Peter.

21:49.205 --> 21:50.502
He's not going to
know where it is.

21:50.506 --> 21:51.902
It's a secret hideaway.

21:52.108 --> 21:55.001
Yeah, well, maybe he can
help us find his ex-son-in-law.

21:55.206 --> 21:56.600
<i>He's got to know where it is.</i>

21:56.606 --> 21:58.003
It was his secret.

22:02.205 --> 22:04.103
I hate these foreground trees.

22:05.908 --> 22:10.503
I hated them yesterday,
ill hate them today.

22:10.508 --> 22:11.600
Mr. Henley?

22:12.505 --> 22:13.801
Hi. My name's Allison Dubois.

22:13.806 --> 22:16.301
I spoke with your receptionist
about an hour ago.

22:16.906 --> 22:20.202
Oh, right, uh... yeah.
Bonnie and Peter's friend.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.900
Have we met before?

22:25.107 --> 22:26.002
Maybe one
of their parties?

22:26.008 --> 22:27.500
You look
awfully familiar.

22:29.708 --> 22:30.700
Mrs. Dubois?

22:30.708 --> 22:32.103
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

22:32.105 --> 22:35.003
Bonnie tried to tell me
what exactly it was
you did for a living,

22:35.006 --> 22:36.900
and I didn't get it.

22:37.506 --> 22:38.501
This is it.

22:38.906 --> 22:41.000
This and six other buildings
like it.

22:41.008 --> 22:43.703
We design and create exhibits

22:43.706 --> 22:46.400
for museums and exhibitions
all over the world.

22:46.405 --> 22:47.600
That's very
impressive.

22:47.707 --> 22:48.600
Thank you.

22:48.906 --> 22:49.702
This is one of those days

22:49.706 --> 22:53.302
where I feel like an
overpaid window dresser.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.702
So thank you.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.301
Now, what can
I do for you?

22:57.308 --> 22:59.501
Are you shopping
for a life-sized,

22:59.506 --> 23:01.300
historical diorama
of your very own?

23:01.305 --> 23:04.400
Or is there something else
I can help you with today?

23:05.605 --> 23:07.303
Mr. Henley, actually,
I was hoping

23:07.307 --> 23:08.903
to talk to you
about your ex-wife.

23:10.908 --> 23:11.800
She's missing.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.500
"Missing" may be overstating it.

23:15.908 --> 23:17.401
Uh, she ran away.

23:17.705 --> 23:19.500
Her parents are very
concerned about her.

23:20.606 --> 23:21.700
Sounds like my Melissa.

23:22.506 --> 23:24.300
So what scared her off
this time?

23:24.706 --> 23:25.700
I don't know how
much you know.

23:25.707 --> 23:28.702
I don't know how much the two
of you have kept in contact.

23:30.908 --> 23:33.901
She's planning on getting
married next month.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.703
Mel and I haven't spoken
in years.

23:39.007 --> 23:42.701
I needed to do some healing
after our marriage ended.

23:42.705 --> 23:44.603
And for my own peace of mind

23:44.608 --> 23:47.803
I just had to cut off contact
for a little while.

23:48.008 --> 23:48.800
I understand.

23:48.808 --> 23:51.202
I'm sorry-- I didn't mean to
stir up any painful memories.

23:51.506 --> 23:54.202
Just no one else seems to know
where she might be.

23:54.608 --> 23:56.000
So you thought you'd come
to the last guy

23:56.007 --> 23:57.103
that Melissa ran out on,

23:57.108 --> 23:58.703
and see if he could
shed any light.

23:59.506 --> 24:02.601
I know the two of
you had a cabin.

24:07.005 --> 24:08.802
Now I know where
I know you from.

24:09.307 --> 24:10.802
You were in the papers
a while back.

24:10.905 --> 24:13.801
You worked with that
district attorney, right?

24:13.807 --> 24:16.301
The one who messed up
the serial killer thing?

24:17.207 --> 24:18.901
Well, same old Bonnie.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.901
Leave it to her
to find someone like you

24:21.907 --> 24:24.503
to help her
with Melissa.

24:25.107 --> 24:25.702
Now what did you say?

24:25.705 --> 24:27.203
That we had a cabin?

24:27.206 --> 24:28.103
No. We didn't
have a cabin.

24:28.106 --> 24:30.102
There was a cabin
that we rented,

24:30.406 --> 24:31.602
that Melissa really liked.

24:31.605 --> 24:32.602
It was on Lake Mead.

24:33.408 --> 24:34.702
And I think
she liked it so much

24:34.707 --> 24:37.201
because her parents
didn't know about it.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.602
It was kind of
our secret hideaway.

24:40.405 --> 24:42.503
Is that where you think
she might be?

24:43.408 --> 24:44.502
I'm not sure.

24:44.506 --> 24:45.700
I'm just trying to help.

24:47.307 --> 24:48.701
We went there maybe
three or four times,

24:48.706 --> 24:50.802
but Melissa handled
all the arrangements,

24:50.807 --> 24:53.503
so I don't even remember
the address.

24:53.508 --> 24:54.401
I'm sorry.

24:54.406 --> 24:59.000
The owner's first name
was Chuck, I think.

25:00.008 --> 25:01.101
Sorry.

25:02.606 --> 25:06.102
I know Peter and Bonnie are
probably beside themselves.

25:07.105 --> 25:08.600
But she'll turn up.

25:09.505 --> 25:10.903
She always does.

25:13.408 --> 25:15.002
Say hi to them for me,
will you?

25:16.108 --> 25:17.601
Yeah. Thank you.

25:18.506 --> 25:19.903
<i>Yeah, Lake Mead.</i>

25:21.907 --> 25:23.402
Well, we hope it helps.

25:24.807 --> 25:26.801
Okay, I'm looking forward to it.

25:27.505 --> 25:28.701
Bye.

25:29.007 --> 25:31.601
I take it no one has heard
from Melissa yet?

25:31.806 --> 25:32.802
Not yet.

25:35.207 --> 25:37.000
They're going to call the
Lake Mead Tourist Board

25:37.005 --> 25:38.300
first thing in
the morning.

25:38.807 --> 25:40.601
See if they know of any
locals named Chuck

25:40.606 --> 25:42.101
who have cabins for rent.

25:45.005 --> 25:46.201
It would be
completely wrong

25:46.207 --> 25:47.702
during ts
periodcrisis

25:47.707 --> 25:48.800
to wonder when...

25:49.605 --> 25:51.801
and if he's ever going
to offer you that job,

25:51.806 --> 25:53.001
wouldn't it?
Yes.

25:53.007 --> 25:54.602
It would be
completely wrong.

25:56.006 --> 25:57.700
But I can't help but
wonder either.

26:30.608 --> 26:31.701
Is there some
particular reason

26:31.707 --> 26:33.501
you don't want to take
this to the Barristers?

26:33.506 --> 26:35.801
Allison, this is not an
easy call to make.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.201
"Hey, sorry to wake you up

26:37.207 --> 26:38.603
"in the middle of the night,
Peter,

26:38.605 --> 26:40.102
"but my wife
thinks your daughter

26:40.107 --> 26:42.103
is in the clutches
of some maniac."

26:42.206 --> 26:43.503
You don't get
to pick and choose

26:43.505 --> 26:46.001
Hey...
which dreams you want
to believe in.

26:46.008 --> 26:47.703
Listen, I'm not asking
to pick and choose.

26:48.208 --> 26:48.801
I'm just saying that

26:48.805 --> 26:50.800
if we're going to deliver
this horrific news,

26:50.806 --> 26:53.702
can we at least serve it up
with a side order of hope?

26:54.307 --> 26:56.300
Just tell me that
you saw the,

26:56.308 --> 26:57.600
the make and model
of the car

26:57.607 --> 26:58.901
or the license plate.

26:59.506 --> 27:02.200
That you have some clue as
to where all this happened.

27:04.008 --> 27:05.903
This was just supposed to be
so simple.

27:06.506 --> 27:07.602
Dream the dream.

27:07.806 --> 27:08.900
Find the girl.

27:08.906 --> 27:10.001
Get the job.

27:13.708 --> 27:15.901
Do we have to wake them up
in the middle of the night?

27:16.605 --> 27:18.400
Do you think it'll hold
till morning?

27:19.306 --> 27:20.402
It's like you said...

27:21.106 --> 27:23.303
I don't have any clues,
just bad news.

27:24.508 --> 27:26.900
Yeah, I think
it'll hold till morning.

27:28.507 --> 27:30.200
The trunk of someone's car?

27:31.108 --> 27:33.000
Allison, um...

27:33.908 --> 27:35.403
our daughter left us a message.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.002
She needed time to think.

27:37.106 --> 27:38.202
She wasn't abducted.

27:38.205 --> 27:39.602
She wasn't kidnapped.

27:39.607 --> 27:41.703
Yes, we asked you to
help us find her

27:41.706 --> 27:42.901
but, uh...

27:44.706 --> 27:47.701
I don't think what you're saying
makes much sense.

27:47.807 --> 27:49.403
I know how strange
this sounds.

27:50.905 --> 27:52.203
The dream was very clear.

27:52.206 --> 27:54.102
Your daughter is
in danger.

27:55.608 --> 27:57.301
I think you need
to call the police.

27:57.905 --> 28:00.002
I think you need to file
a missing persons report.

28:00.008 --> 28:02.103
I think you need
to launch a search for her.

28:02.505 --> 28:05.803
We launch this search
on the basis of nothing other

28:05.806 --> 28:07.903
than this woman's dreams
and it turns out she's fine?

28:07.906 --> 28:08.903
Turns out she's
doing exactly

28:08.908 --> 28:10.303
what she said she
was going to do?

28:10.607 --> 28:11.602
Thinking?

28:11.905 --> 28:13.203
She's going to be furious
with us.

28:13.205 --> 28:14.602
Peter, this woman is
trying to help us.

28:14.606 --> 28:15.503
She's trying
to warn us.

28:15.506 --> 28:17.002
She was right
about Lake Mead.

28:17.105 --> 28:18.000
I was?

28:18.507 --> 28:19.502
Partially.

28:20.507 --> 28:21.702
We called there first thing
this morning.

28:21.708 --> 28:25.002
There is a cabin owner
named Chuck.

28:25.107 --> 28:27.203
I don't remember his last name.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.202
He knew exactly
who Melissa was.

28:29.405 --> 28:31.200
He rented a place to her
several times before.

28:31.406 --> 28:33.903
But he hasn't heard from her
in years.

28:33.906 --> 28:35.701
And she certainly
isn't up there now.

28:36.205 --> 28:37.500
Fine, Peter. You win.

28:37.505 --> 28:38.900
She's only half right.
Look,

28:39.106 --> 28:41.700
all I'm saying is we have three
different private investigators

28:41.707 --> 28:42.702
out there looking for her.

28:44.208 --> 28:45.200
Why don't
we take a step back.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.700
You take a step back.

28:46.906 --> 28:47.800
Someone I trust is telling me

28:47.807 --> 28:49.800
my daughter is being
held against her will.

28:50.608 --> 28:51.803
I know what I
have to do.

28:51.808 --> 28:53.202
I'm calling
the police.

29:00.805 --> 29:01.702
She's changed a lot

29:01.706 --> 29:02.902
since that
time but...

29:04.008 --> 29:05.602
Peter does not look happy.

29:06.506 --> 29:08.302
What other choice
do we have, Joe?

29:08.507 --> 29:11.202
Well, how seriously are the
police going to take all this

29:11.508 --> 29:13.101
once they hear
that you're involved?

29:13.105 --> 29:15.102
No one's going to mention me.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.200
Oh, excuse me.

29:23.505 --> 29:24.403
Steven, hi.

29:24.405 --> 29:25.303
Uh, come in.

29:25.308 --> 29:26.102
Come, come in.

29:26.108 --> 29:27.503
My plane got in
a little early.

29:28.907 --> 29:30.502
My favorite
son-in-law to be.

29:30.806 --> 29:31.802
I'm glad you're here.

29:33.206 --> 29:33.802
What...

29:33.808 --> 29:34.901
What is all this?

29:35.907 --> 29:36.902
Steven...

29:37.807 --> 29:39.600
I can't give you
specifics just now,

29:39.607 --> 29:41.802
but suffice it to say that
we have reason to believe

29:41.808 --> 29:44.600
that someone may be holding
Melissa somewhere

29:44.605 --> 29:45.701
against her will.

29:46.107 --> 29:47.300
You're kidding me,
right?

29:47.406 --> 29:48.902
But that's not possible.

29:48.908 --> 29:50.001
I don't want to believe
it either...

29:50.005 --> 29:51.102
No. You don't understand.

29:51.105 --> 29:52.900
It's actually not possible.

29:53.105 --> 29:55.000
She just left me a message
an hour ago.

29:57.007 --> 29:58.900
Hey. It's me.

29:59.205 --> 30:02.400
I know I'm being a coward,
leaving a message, but...

30:03.206 --> 30:04.903
I just didn't think
I could handle talking to you.

30:04.907 --> 30:05.900
Not yet.

30:06.506 --> 30:07.801
I'm not going to tell you
where I am,

30:07.805 --> 30:09.902
but I wanted you to know
that I was safe.

30:10.707 --> 30:12.102
That I'm thinking about you.

30:12.608 --> 30:13.803
About us.

30:14.407 --> 30:16.800
I just need little more time
to figure it all out.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.003
When I do, I'll be in touch.

30:19.506 --> 30:20.702
I promise.
Oh...

30:21.005 --> 30:22.801
I turned my phone back on
when the plane landed,

30:23.006 --> 30:24.100
there it was.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.403
She knew I was flying back
from L.A. today.

30:26.705 --> 30:28.201
I figured she did it
on purpose.

30:28.407 --> 30:29.901
Called my cell when
she knew it'd be off,

30:29.908 --> 30:31.900
so she could
avoid speaking to me.

30:31.905 --> 30:33.001
Oh, thank God
she's okay.

30:33.006 --> 30:34.300
Thank God.

30:37.607 --> 30:38.502
I'd, uh...

30:38.507 --> 30:40.001
I'd better explain
to the detectives

30:40.406 --> 30:43.002
why we won't be needing
their assistance after all.

30:45.605 --> 30:46.600
As for the two of you,

30:47.508 --> 30:49.403
I suggest you slip out
of here quietly,

30:49.405 --> 30:51.701
before I ask these police
officers to find something

30:51.706 --> 30:53.203
to charge you with.

31:02.307 --> 31:03.202
Hey.

31:03.308 --> 31:04.203
Hey.

31:06.806 --> 31:07.803
Kids down?

31:08.705 --> 31:09.603
Yep.

31:09.906 --> 31:10.901
And out.

31:11.007 --> 31:12.201
All except Ariel.

31:13.207 --> 31:14.103
What you doing?

31:21.206 --> 31:22.101
What you doing?

31:22.708 --> 31:24.201
I'm looking for a job.

31:25.605 --> 31:26.603
How's it going?

31:27.407 --> 31:28.901
Well, that depends.

31:29.708 --> 31:31.303
How you feel
about Oregon?

31:37.305 --> 31:38.700
I'm so sorry.

31:40.508 --> 31:42.801
I know how badly
you wanted that job.

31:45.008 --> 31:47.402
I know how badly we needed
that job.

31:50.307 --> 31:51.401
I just...

31:54.107 --> 31:55.400
I don't know.

32:03.307 --> 32:04.101
Okay.

32:05.907 --> 32:07.401
Guess I'll go to bed.

32:10.005 --> 32:11.002
Co here.

32:24.206 --> 32:26.802
A federal jury in Chicago
found reputed Mob boss

32:26.805 --> 32:28.700
Joseph Binale Nardiello

32:28.806 --> 32:30.702
guilty on all charges today

32:30.808 --> 32:33.301
after a five-month trial
in federal court.

32:33.608 --> 32:36.703
A racketeering conspiracy charge
included in the indictment

32:36.705 --> 32:40.000
carries a maximum sentence
of 20 years in federal prison.

32:40.205 --> 32:42.903
Sentencing will be set
on February 28.

32:43.107 --> 32:44.202
You see that ?

32:44.905 --> 32:47.900
See? Someone had
a day worse than ours.

33:00.806 --> 33:01.502
And...

33:01.506 --> 33:04.501
Morning paper! Read all about...

33:04.706 --> 33:06.200
Big news out of Chicago today

33:06.205 --> 33:09.101
as Joseph Binale Nardiello
was found guilty

33:09.105 --> 33:12.003
on all charges,
after a five-month trial.

33:16.207 --> 33:17.201
You okay?

33:18.208 --> 33:19.202
Everything all right?

33:20.806 --> 33:21.802
Yeah.

33:22.505 --> 33:23.502
I think so.

33:25.408 --> 33:26.703
You remember
when I told you

33:26.705 --> 33:30.503
that Melissa would never
have gone back to Paris

33:30.507 --> 33:33.103
to figure out whether or not
she wanted to marry Steven?

33:35.308 --> 33:37.302
I think I must
have been wrong.

33:40.506 --> 33:42.103
Oh, Mr. Henley.

33:42.608 --> 33:43.501
Ah, thank goodness.

33:43.508 --> 33:44.803
I was afraid
I might've missed you.

33:45.406 --> 33:46.702
You have so many buildings here,

33:46.708 --> 33:49.103
I wasn't sure
this was the right one.

33:49.608 --> 33:51.001
Mrs. Dubois,
did you call?

33:51.506 --> 33:52.901
Was somebody
in my organization

33:52.908 --> 33:54.701
supposed to let me know
that you wanted to see me?

33:54.907 --> 33:57.402
No, it all happened
spontaneously.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.502
You said that you
had read about me.

34:00.808 --> 34:01.400
Yeah.

34:02.105 --> 34:03.601
I had a dream
last night...

34:03.807 --> 34:06.700
a dream about Melissa,
about where she may be.

34:07.808 --> 34:09.800
I know this sounds crazy,

34:11.505 --> 34:13.701
but I think that
she may be in Paris.

34:13.804 --> 34:14.900
I think she may be
in the hotel

34:14.908 --> 34:16.702
that the two of you
honeymooned in.

34:17.804 --> 34:18.402
What?!

34:18.405 --> 34:19.900
It doesn't make a lot
of sense to me either,

34:19.906 --> 34:21.101
but there you go.

34:21.304 --> 34:22.601
Anyway, I spent
most of my day

34:22.606 --> 34:24.802
trying to figure out
which hotel in Paris.

34:25.505 --> 34:26.301
And it's a long story,

34:26.308 --> 34:28.600
but I can't really ask
Bonnie and Peter.

34:29.306 --> 34:30.301
And then I realized...

34:31.505 --> 34:32.601
I could ask you.

34:33.907 --> 34:35.101
I know it
sounds crazy.

34:36.105 --> 34:37.000
Let me get this straight--

34:37.005 --> 34:39.002
you... you saw Melissa...

34:39.505 --> 34:43.502
in the same hotel that
she and I honeymooned in...

34:44.007 --> 34:45.201
in a dream?

34:48.607 --> 34:50.101
Okay, um...

34:50.108 --> 34:51.502
Residence de Bastille.

34:51.706 --> 34:53.100
Residence de Bastille.

34:53.106 --> 34:53.701
Yeah.

34:54.005 --> 34:55.303
But I'm afraid you're
not gonna find her there.

34:56.007 --> 34:56.803
Why do you say that?

34:56.806 --> 34:59.000
It was torn down in 2003.

34:59.608 --> 35:00.903
No, are you sure?

35:01.105 --> 35:03.201
Positive. I tried to book
a room there last year.

35:04.308 --> 35:05.201
Look...

35:06.606 --> 35:08.602
I don't mean to tell you
your business, but...

35:08.806 --> 35:10.302
it sounds to me like...

35:11.507 --> 35:14.102
your dream was just a dream.

35:28.006 --> 35:29.002
You okay?

35:30.307 --> 35:32.303
Yes. I'm fine.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.103
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

35:43.207 --> 35:44.802
Phoenix Police Department,
may I help you?

35:52.407 --> 35:53.402
What are you doing here?

35:54.108 --> 35:55.201
Do you have any
idea how much trouble

35:55.208 --> 35:56.900
I'll be in if
anybody saw you?

35:57.806 --> 35:59.102
What if Van Dyke
walked in?

36:01.607 --> 36:03.003
Wait a second.
I'm confused.

36:04.507 --> 36:05.603
How could anything
you've seen

36:05.607 --> 36:07.803
possibly have
happened in the present,

36:08.207 --> 36:09.401
in Paris, no less,

36:09.408 --> 36:11.302
if that hotel room
doesn't exist anymore?

36:11.305 --> 36:12.402
I think he built it.

36:13.106 --> 36:14.703
The hotel room--
I think he built it.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.502
He recreated it
down to the titiniest detail.

36:18.205 --> 36:20.503
I think he even
duplicated the view.

36:20.808 --> 36:21.803
You're serious?

36:22.007 --> 36:23.102
Look, I know how it sounds.

36:23.106 --> 36:25.303
I tossed and turned
about this all last night.

36:25.608 --> 36:27.700
But this is what this guy does.

36:27.808 --> 36:29.202
He builds dioramas.

36:29.807 --> 36:31.101
He builds environments.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.403
So you're saying you think
that Melissa Barrister

36:33.407 --> 36:36.403
is being held captive
in some fake Paris hotel room

36:36.406 --> 36:38.202
that this guy built
over there at his business?

36:39.105 --> 36:40.000
But why?

36:41.708 --> 36:42.500
I don't know.

36:44.007 --> 36:45.501
She's about to marry again.

36:45.506 --> 36:47.702
Maybe the idea
of losing her forever...

36:49.106 --> 36:51.003
I think he thought
he could win her back.

36:51.607 --> 36:53.301
All right, look,
even if I could

36:53.308 --> 36:55.602
wrap my mind around
the idea of this lovesick guy

36:55.705 --> 36:57.301
building an elaborate
stage set

36:57.308 --> 36:59.701
to woo his ex-wife...

37:01.905 --> 37:03.303
...there's no way
I can get a warrant

37:03.306 --> 37:06.302
to search that complex
on the basis of a dream.

37:06.308 --> 37:07.300
It's not gonna happen.

37:07.307 --> 37:08.503
I know that.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.300
I'm just worried.

37:11.306 --> 37:12.300
He knows who I am.

37:12.307 --> 37:13.102
He knows I'm looking.

37:13.106 --> 37:15.203
He knows I know
about that hotel room.

37:15.707 --> 37:17.502
I think I may have
rattled his cage.

37:18.007 --> 37:20.301
I am concerned
about what he may do to her.

37:20.408 --> 37:21.802
No, no, no, I hear that.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.601
<i>But I still can't
legally go in there.</i>

37:27.807 --> 37:30.302
I mean, it's not like somebody
called in a fire alarm

37:30.308 --> 37:33.200
or a chemical spill
or a bomb threat.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.202
What are you saying?

37:35.805 --> 37:38.600
I mean, I'm going to be in that
area around 10:30 this morning.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.301
About an hour
and fifteen from now.

37:42.008 --> 37:43.801
And you know,
if somebody did call in,

37:43.808 --> 37:46.300
like a fire or a bomb threat,
something like that,

37:46.306 --> 37:50.302
then being in the area,
I'd actually be legally obliged

37:50.905 --> 37:52.702
to assist the emergency crews--

37:53.008 --> 37:55.102
walk through every building,
each and every room

37:55.307 --> 37:58.202
in that complex to make sure
that everyone was evacuated.

38:00.505 --> 38:01.803
But failing that...

38:02.506 --> 38:03.503
Oh...

38:04.905 --> 38:07.903
In any case, I'm sorry
I couldn't have been more help.

38:12.507 --> 38:15.002
Somebody please
let me out of here!

38:16.205 --> 38:18.003
Please let me out!

38:20.807 --> 38:22.102
Please!

38:39.106 --> 38:41.902
Somebody, please!

38:44.205 --> 38:46.003
Somebody...

38:57.607 --> 38:59.000
Melissa Barrister was released

38:59.008 --> 39:01.402
from Casa Valley Memorial
Hospital this morning

39:01.608 --> 39:04.902
where she was held for 24-hour
observation after spending

39:04.906 --> 39:08.200
four nights a captive of her
ex-husband, Kent Henley.

39:08.506 --> 39:11.600
Mr. Henley, who abducted
his former wife at gunpoint,

39:11.707 --> 39:13.103
went to great lengths
to give her family

39:13.108 --> 39:15.100
the impression
that she had run away,

39:15.206 --> 39:18.402
even going so far as to force
Ms. Barrister to leave a message

39:18.407 --> 39:21.200
on her fiance's cell phone
that indicated she was

39:21.207 --> 39:23.002
safe and would come home soon.

39:23.206 --> 39:24.302
In other news...

39:24.708 --> 39:25.701
This is so not fair.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.903
They didn't even mention
how Mommy helped.

39:28.906 --> 39:29.600
Here, hon.

39:29.608 --> 39:30.702
Well, it's okay, honey.

39:31.705 --> 39:34.200
Mommy's had more than enough
attention the last few months.

39:34.907 --> 39:37.101
Mr. Barrister knows,
though, right?

39:37.307 --> 39:38.903
Now he'll give you the job?

39:39.405 --> 39:41.703
Uh, well, he would
give Daddy the job,

39:41.705 --> 39:43.703
except he doesn't own
the company anymore.

39:44.406 --> 39:45.802
He called us last night
to let us know

39:45.808 --> 39:47.100
that he was selling it.

39:48.305 --> 39:50.301
He wanted to stay home
with his daughter,

39:50.906 --> 39:53.103
help her get better after
everything she'd been through.

39:53.405 --> 39:55.703
Okay, but doesn't
the new owner

39:55.705 --> 39:57.203
still need an engineer?

39:58.005 --> 40:00.801
Uh... I'm pretty sure
that Aerodytech

40:00.805 --> 40:02.602
has all the engineers
they can handle.

40:03.606 --> 40:04.800
Aerodytech?

40:05.105 --> 40:06.801
Your old company
is the new owner?

40:07.206 --> 40:08.002
Mm-hmm.

40:08.505 --> 40:09.900
That's so not fair.

40:12.005 --> 40:13.100
What are you doing?

40:13.708 --> 40:15.102
Still looking for a job.

40:15.807 --> 40:16.603
Any luck?

40:16.605 --> 40:18.200
Um, that depends.

40:19.105 --> 40:20.201
How do you feel about Oregon?

40:20.907 --> 40:23.003
You mean building it
or actually living there?

40:24.605 --> 40:26.501
Come here.

40:31.705 --> 40:32.901
Mom ! Dad !

40:32.906 --> 40:34.302
No. Ew ! Stop !

40:35.005 --> 40:39.003
Stop it, Stop it !
