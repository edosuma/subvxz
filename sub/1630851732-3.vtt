00:45.587 --> 00:46.964
Fuck.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.743
Sh--

02:45.415 --> 02:46.500
Come on.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.089
What the fuck?

03:00.681 --> 03:04.476
Any station. Any station.
This is SOC Trevante Cole.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.938
Stand by. I'm passing
my ten-digit grid in the blind.

03:10.315 --> 03:14.945
11151… 4--

03:15.028 --> 03:17.865
Fuck. 8770.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.293
We were attacked by an unknown aircraft,
something I've never seen before. My men--

03:30.752 --> 03:32.045
My men are MIA--

03:32.129 --> 03:34.464
Fuck. Fuck. Hello?

03:34.548 --> 03:36.675
Fuck! Shit!

03:42.181 --> 03:43.974
All right. Come on.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.582
-This isn't a road. Aneesha!
-Mommy, where are we going?

05:32.457 --> 05:33.375
Slow down. Slow--

05:35.252 --> 05:36.420
Aneesha.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.147
-Where are we going?
-Out of the city.

06:01.820 --> 06:02.988
Mom, what's going on?

06:03.822 --> 06:04.990
Mommy!

06:08.660 --> 06:09.870
Fine?

06:14.625 --> 06:16.502
What's going on?

07:14.351 --> 07:18.522
No, no, no. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, sir?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.731
Sir? It's me.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.484
Help him.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.033
-Mr. E?
-He's fucked up.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.202
Now what do we do? There's no signal.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.996
Take a pulse or something.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.497
Where are we?

07:35.581 --> 07:38.333
No one has no service, mate.
We have nothing.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.503
-We have to try and pull him out.
-He's dying.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.005
-He's dying.
-Help!

07:43.088 --> 07:47.593
Help!

07:47.676 --> 07:48.677
Someone!

07:48.760 --> 07:50.888
Help!

AFTERMATH OF SHOCK SPREADS

KAITO

10:23.624 --> 10:26.001
KAITO
WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU COMING?

12:39.384 --> 12:40.636
Fell from the sky.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.056
-Do they know what they're doing?
-Look.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.560
What's he saying?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.819
Oi, careful. His arm's all--

12:57.903 --> 12:59.238
We have to stop the bleeding.

12:59.905 --> 13:02.908
-Is he gonna be okay?
-It's all right. My mum's a nurse.

13:08.664 --> 13:09.748
Do you have a tissue?

13:10.916 --> 13:13.877
It's a good tourniquet.
It should slow the bleeding.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.631
Yo, Casp. I-Is he all right?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.301
Can he talk, at least?

13:26.390 --> 13:27.599
You made us crash.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.893
You made him turn around
on account of your spaz head,

13:29.977 --> 13:31.562
foaming at your fucking mouth again.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.938
N-No.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.189
It's your fault.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.024
Oi, get up!

13:36.108 --> 13:37.109
Oi!

13:37.192 --> 13:38.944
-Stop it!
-Did you fucking hear him?

13:39.027 --> 13:40.779
-Hey!
-Hey, what?

13:41.405 --> 13:44.533
You know what? He shouldn't be in school,
let alone this school trip.

13:45.117 --> 13:48.036
He should be in one of those special
schools where they pad up the buses.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.497
-No, I-- I didn't--
-Didn't what? Didn't spaz?

13:51.915 --> 13:53.292
I should knife you, neek.

13:56.587 --> 13:57.838
Guys!

13:57.921 --> 13:59.756
He only needs a doctor, but fast.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.550
Don't defend him, okay? It's his fault.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.386
He'll pay for it.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.471
Monty, I've got crisps.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.141
-Until help comes.
-The fuck is this?

14:09.224 --> 14:12.186
-Got snacks for days, man.
-And fizzy drinks.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.105
-Mum wasn't looking when we packed.
-Let's see that.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.400
You think help's coming? Here?

14:19.193 --> 14:20.652
-I'm not fucking drinking that.
-It might.

14:20.736 --> 14:23.405
-My mum doesn't know where I am.
-Can't even text.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.741
Listen, we have to go up.

14:26.325 --> 14:27.451
Are you a spaz too?

14:28.285 --> 14:30.454
Up what? That?
What he just brought us down?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.623
Well, someone has to get help.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.665
Send him then.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.044
Let him fall on his fucking head.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.295
No, we can't leave him.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.713
You'll leave if I tell you to.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.715
I'll go, if someone--

14:41.798 --> 14:43.592
Did you not hear me? No one's going, okay?

14:43.675 --> 14:45.135
Guys, I'm sure it's fine.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.013
-We just need to call some-- Call home.
-There's no fucking signal.

14:48.096 --> 14:50.224
-I'll go too…
-Yeah, safe to die.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.600
Break all your fucking bones.

15:22.297 --> 15:25.217
Mommy, I really need to go pee.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.053
-I know, sweetie. I know.
-Watch out. Watch out.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.680
Traffic is at a standstill.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.390
Daddy's charging the car.

15:31.473 --> 15:35.018
…backed up for hours as thousands attempt
to leave the metropolitan area.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.419
Can I get a Slurpee?

16:00.502 --> 16:02.629
-I want one too.
-Come on, guys. Hurry.

16:02.713 --> 16:03.714
Watch your sister.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.425
Very strange things are happening.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.801
-There does seem to be…
-My God.

16:07.885 --> 16:13.432
…an ongoing, devastating, and coordinated
international attack underway.

16:13.515 --> 16:16.685
We don't know yet who is behind
all these awful events.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.061
No group has claimed credit yet…

16:18.145 --> 16:21.481
…but the effects are being felt worldwide.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.776
Once again,
we're showing you smartphone footage

16:24.860 --> 16:27.613
sent to us by viewers
all around the tristate area.

16:27.696 --> 16:32.075
We are also getting footage from
our sister stations around the country.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.204
The best thing we can do is to stay calm…

16:36.705 --> 16:40.000
Hey! My buddy's about to pull in here.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.085
Are you kidding?

16:42.169 --> 16:43.670
Does it look like I'm kidding?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.970
This fucking guy's--

16:52.054 --> 16:55.599
Guys, guys, guys. We're cool, yeah?
We're cool. All in this together.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.477
This is our local gas station, Osama.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.812
Hey, hey, hey!

17:03.398 --> 17:05.526
-Wanna do this right now?
-I was here before you.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.569
I was here before you.

17:09.655 --> 17:13.534
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
They didn't have the kind that you like.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.911
Get in your car. Get out of here.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.329
I'm here with my family!

17:17.412 --> 17:19.665
-…toilet paper. I had to use paper towels.
-Ahmed.

17:19.748 --> 17:20.915
She clogged the toilet.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.415
-Ahmed, we're leaving.
-Did not.

17:23.544 --> 17:24.545
We're leaving.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.096
-I haven't even charged the battery.
-We're leaving now.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.223
-Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
-Now.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.641
Go.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.727
Hey, hey, hey.

17:41.645 --> 17:44.273
-But this isn't our car.
-It is now.

17:54.533 --> 17:59.371
Hey! Hey! That's my car!
Hey! That's my car!

18:08.630 --> 18:10.090
Mom, whose car is this?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.093
I don't know, sweetie.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.431
They'll be fine. They'll be fine, buddy.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.424
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.018
Stay--

19:03.894 --> 19:05.604
Stay the fuck back!

19:05.687 --> 19:07.231
Back up!

19:08.232 --> 19:09.733
Let me see your hands.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.320
Put your hands where I can see 'em,
or I'll fucking shoot you.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.821
Don't fucking move, man.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.494
Stay back.

19:58.657 --> 19:59.867
Have you seen my men?

20:01.034 --> 20:02.119
Americans.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.621
There was an explosion.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.583
Did you see it?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.501
Hear it?

20:09.585 --> 20:10.919
Yes.

20:11.753 --> 20:12.838
Okay.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.006
Have you seen my men?

20:16.383 --> 20:17.384
Boom, boom.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.721
Boom, boom. Yes. Did you see them?

20:20.804 --> 20:23.432
I need to protect them. Me. Protect them.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.522
"Yak."

20:30.606 --> 20:32.983
What's "yak"? Yak. Wait.

20:34.735 --> 20:35.736
Hey.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.739
Hey.

20:52.836 --> 20:53.837
Yeah.

20:55.631 --> 20:56.632
Seven.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.425
Seven.

20:59.635 --> 21:04.056
Seven, plus the translator. American.
You saw them. Take me to them.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.017
Can you take me--

21:12.648 --> 21:14.608
Can you take-- Hey.

21:14.691 --> 21:15.692
Hey!

21:41.885 --> 21:43.095
Mitsuki!

21:44.429 --> 21:45.848
Where have you been?

21:46.223 --> 21:48.809
The syncs were running
and emergency switches were active.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.019
No abnormalities in the pressurizer
or lander, and then--

21:51.103 --> 21:52.104
You reek of alcohol.

21:52.187 --> 21:54.398
You need a shower.

22:01.905 --> 22:02.948
Mitsuki, wait!

22:05.492 --> 22:06.618
What are you doing?

22:07.202 --> 22:09.162
An independent commission is taking over.

22:10.706 --> 22:11.874
Under whose orders?

22:11.957 --> 22:13.250
The Japanese government.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.213
We can't do anything
during their investigation.

22:18.297 --> 22:19.631
Is this a joke?

22:19.715 --> 22:20.841
This is mine.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.718
-I'll be taking it back
-Yamato-san!

22:24.094 --> 22:25.304
What are you doing?

22:26.763 --> 22:29.808
This won't work. These people don't know
what they're doing.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.144
Let me into the comms room.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.438
I need to figure out
the cause of the accident.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.442
I'm the only one who can figure out
what the hell happened.

22:40.027 --> 22:42.237
Then why didn't we get
their distress call?

22:43.363 --> 22:44.823
Why did we lose comms
for three hours?

22:44.907 --> 22:46.241
That's your job.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.743
Not mine.

22:50.996 --> 22:51.997
Go home.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.424
Get back here! Security!

23:02.508 --> 23:04.718
Out of the way!
Move! Get out of the way!

23:05.302 --> 23:06.303
Stop!

23:14.436 --> 23:15.521
Mitsuki!

23:25.155 --> 23:26.240
What are you doing?

23:29.660 --> 23:31.411
You know… you'll get fired for this.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.583
No, you're going to get arrested.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.046
Help me.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.549
I reset the door lock code.

23:43.632 --> 23:46.802
No one can go in or out until I'm done.

23:46.885 --> 23:48.595
If you want to get out sooner than later

23:48.679 --> 23:50.931
you should stop screwing around
and help me.

23:56.186 --> 23:58.981
Hashimoto-san's encrypted
all of the video files.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.067
We have to go through every single one.

24:02.651 --> 24:04.778
For what?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.991
To find the video of her last moments.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.552
He's safe inside for now. Mr. E.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.471
But we need help.
And we need to get to a hospital.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.643
If someone sees the fire,
maybe they'll help.

24:43.859 --> 24:45.360
Big bruvs teach you all this?

24:47.613 --> 24:49.323
Boiler goes a little funny sometimes.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.075
Ours too, when they don't pay the bills.

24:56.038 --> 24:57.539
Caspar the pyromaniac.

25:04.171 --> 25:05.839
Am I interrupting something?

25:05.923 --> 25:06.924
No.

25:10.969 --> 25:11.970
Good.

25:12.971 --> 25:13.972
So…

25:17.726 --> 25:19.561
I'm sorry about before.

25:24.525 --> 25:25.359
What?

25:33.909 --> 25:35.369
God, she's a talker.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.589
You're sorry?

25:49.424 --> 25:51.718
I'm just saying,
you're pretty handy for a cripple.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.597
-I'm not a cripple.
-I'm sorry. Is that not the right word?

25:55.681 --> 25:57.432
Spaz with a mum in a wheelchair?

25:58.225 --> 25:59.560
Is that how you describe her?

26:00.686 --> 26:02.980
Four-wheeler, chair-bear,

26:03.522 --> 26:05.566
-Stephen Hawking--
-Wheelchair-bound.

26:10.863 --> 26:12.656
Is that why your dad buggered off?

26:12.739 --> 26:14.032
Something like that.

26:21.123 --> 26:22.291
My dad, he…

26:26.211 --> 26:27.462
He didn't need a reason.

26:34.595 --> 26:35.721
Just a secretary.

26:38.557 --> 26:40.184
-I didn't know.
-Course you didn't.

26:44.897 --> 26:46.565
I came back from school once…

26:47.774 --> 26:49.860
and Pop was all packed up,
saying he needed to…

26:51.612 --> 26:53.238
saying he needed to start over.

26:54.990 --> 26:56.658
"Start over." That's how he said it.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.578
Like life's just a game of Fortnite.

27:06.418 --> 27:09.213
Do you know what? Fuck 'em, right?
They wanna go, let 'em go.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.715
Better off without 'em.

27:23.519 --> 27:25.103
My dad put my mum in that chair.

27:34.905 --> 27:36.240
They was having a row.

27:37.533 --> 27:38.534
And…

27:40.410 --> 27:42.037
he pushed her down the stairs.

27:45.415 --> 27:46.500
Messed up.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.043
That's why…

27:52.589 --> 27:54.007
I should've done something.

27:55.551 --> 27:56.552
I could've.

27:57.928 --> 28:00.264
-I could've maybe--
-You were scared.

28:00.889 --> 28:01.890
Yeah.

28:01.974 --> 28:03.141
Yeah, I know.

28:07.688 --> 28:09.439
By the time the ambulance got there…

28:11.733 --> 28:12.860
he was gone.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.615
Didn't even take his things.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.577
She kept 'em there for a couple of years…

28:27.040 --> 28:28.584
thinking he'd come back for them.

28:32.754 --> 28:33.922
Monty!

28:38.302 --> 28:40.554
I really wanted to hurt him
for what he did.

28:44.892 --> 28:47.394
That's really sad-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:50.814 --> 28:52.274
I was just taking the piss, mate.

28:53.025 --> 28:54.526
My old man's still with us. Never left.

28:54.610 --> 28:57.529
Not even a fucking day.
He's the best dad in London, mate.

28:58.322 --> 28:59.323
Do you know what?

28:59.406 --> 29:02.201
Thank you, bruv. Thank you for the story.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.078
Son of a wife-beater.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.790
I'll be sure to keep that one
for a rainy day.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.293
Oh, look.

29:11.835 --> 29:13.170
It might start raining today…

29:13.253 --> 29:14.379
Hey, M. Check this out.

29:16.673 --> 29:17.841
What did you do?

29:17.925 --> 29:19.510
I got petrol, man.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.011
Go get some more.

29:32.314 --> 29:34.316
Tell me you have a room with two beds.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.777
Sorry, hon. It's a circus.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.570
I got two kings left.

29:40.614 --> 29:41.448
Yeah.

29:43.534 --> 29:46.328
But there's a rollaway for the kiddos.

29:46.411 --> 29:47.579
It's not for them.

29:50.624 --> 29:51.625
Can we watch TV?

29:51.708 --> 29:52.709
Sure.

29:52.793 --> 29:55.254
-I wanna pick.
-You always get to pick.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.798
-In Brazil, Flight 170…
-It's your brother's turn.

29:57.881 --> 30:00.342
…has plummeted out of the sky
this evening,

30:00.425 --> 30:02.719
crashing into the city of São Paulo,

30:02.803 --> 30:06.306
where ten million people
are without power still.

30:06.807 --> 30:11.812
The flight carried 220 passengers,
including a flight crew of 12 people…

30:11.895 --> 30:13.522
…adding to the global death toll

30:13.605 --> 30:17.693
of what we can now confirm
is the largest-scale terrorist attack

30:17.776 --> 30:19.152
since 9/11.

30:19.778 --> 30:24.241
Numbers are difficult to accurately report
while cellular--

30:39.673 --> 30:40.716
Mommy.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.052
There.

30:44.136 --> 30:45.971
Come on, this is for babies.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.224
It's this or nothing.

30:50.225 --> 30:51.602
I'm hungry.

30:52.477 --> 30:54.897
There's a vending machine
outside the office.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.981
Yeah, sure.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.959
Hi, Baba. I guess I just missed you.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.254
I don't know what's going on everywhere.

31:19.338 --> 31:21.924
The kids and I are safe.

31:22.007 --> 31:24.551
We are staying somewhere
in Upstate New York.

31:24.635 --> 31:26.762
We found a place to stay.

31:27.596 --> 31:30.474
Our cell phones are not working,
so I'll try you later.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.978
I love you. Bye.

31:47.866 --> 31:48.867
Careful.

31:48.951 --> 31:52.454
Go on.
You've been eating all our snacks, piggy.

31:52.538 --> 31:54.456
-Got to eat something.
-We all do. Okay?

31:55.207 --> 31:57.125
That's why we ration the crisps and water.

31:57.209 --> 31:59.127
Will anyone see it? The fire?

31:59.211 --> 32:01.380
Why do you think
they call it a signal fire?

32:01.463 --> 32:03.423
We sleep here. Someone will come looking.

32:03.507 --> 32:05.634
We were meant to get there six hours ago.

32:05.717 --> 32:08.178
Bus full of kids,
it'll be all over the news by now.

32:08.262 --> 32:09.471
The lights are out.

32:10.889 --> 32:13.100
-How do you know that?
-'Cause I said so.

32:13.851 --> 32:15.978
Pile up the crisps and drinks, Biggie.

32:16.645 --> 32:17.729
We's rationing.

32:18.355 --> 32:21.149
-Who died and made you prime minister?
-What you say, knob?

32:21.775 --> 32:23.068
This ain't Westminster.

32:25.237 --> 32:27.364
You wanna vote? Fine. Let's vote.

32:27.447 --> 32:29.032
Someone has to take charge.

32:30.409 --> 32:34.955
All in favor of me running
this little island, raise 'em up.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.052
Sorry, Mr. Big Shot.

32:49.553 --> 32:52.055
Looks like you're a vote short
of Downing Street.

33:05.944 --> 33:06.945
Hey, ghost.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.952
Looks like it might start raining.

33:40.646 --> 33:41.980
Settles it then.

33:42.773 --> 33:43.774
Let's go.

34:10.092 --> 34:11.510
Am I so evil?

34:14.054 --> 34:16.681
You don't get to pretend
like I'm overreacting.

34:18.350 --> 34:20.561
You actually tried to get into
our neighbor's car

34:20.643 --> 34:21.937
and leave them behind.

34:22.771 --> 34:24.063
Look at you.

34:24.147 --> 34:26.733
You fight a man at the gas station
over nothing.

34:26.817 --> 34:27.860
He hit me.

34:27.943 --> 34:29.862
Yeah, and I should believe what you say.

34:33.574 --> 34:34.783
Everyone hates me.

34:37.536 --> 34:39.663
All those people out there.

34:40.831 --> 34:41.831
You.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.545
Is it so evil to want someone to actually…

34:50.882 --> 34:52.301
love me?

34:54.761 --> 34:56.304
I loved you, Manny.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.265
And I loved you too.

35:04.313 --> 35:08.525
I did everything right, Manny.
Everything I was supposed to do.

35:09.818 --> 35:12.404
But I guess it wasn't good enough for you.

35:19.912 --> 35:23.624
Manny and Mandy. Sounds cute.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.918
Fuck you.

35:29.129 --> 35:30.964
No. No.

35:31.465 --> 35:32.508
Mom?

35:33.175 --> 35:35.844
Mom, what's happening?

35:38.430 --> 35:39.765
Mom?

35:39.848 --> 35:41.517
They were asleep.

35:57.866 --> 35:59.243
…US 9 North.

36:01.453 --> 36:04.164
My cell doesn't work,
so I'll try you later.

36:07.584 --> 36:08.669
Hope you're safe.

36:14.883 --> 36:16.260
I love you so much.

36:23.809 --> 36:24.810
Thank you.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.311
Easy, man. Shit.

37:53.607 --> 37:56.151
Fuck, man! The fuck was that?

38:01.615 --> 38:04.493
Is that goat piss?
Is that what you said? Goat piss?

38:06.286 --> 38:07.287
Shit.

38:08.121 --> 38:10.123
"Meow"? The fuck does "meow" mean?

38:25.389 --> 38:26.807
I saw that thing, man.

38:28.517 --> 38:29.810
What the fuck was that, man?

38:29.893 --> 38:31.812
I could see it,
but then I couldn't see it.

38:31.895 --> 38:33.814
And I could see it, and it was there.

38:36.692 --> 38:37.860
My men. Fuck.

38:39.027 --> 38:41.238
There was a town that they overturned.

38:41.321 --> 38:42.322
Dishu, or--

38:42.406 --> 38:43.574
Dishu?

38:45.659 --> 38:46.869
Yes, Dishu.

38:47.953 --> 38:49.204
Yeah, can you take me there?

38:50.622 --> 38:52.457
Dishu, yes. Can we go?

38:54.459 --> 38:56.628
Now. No, no, no. Now. Can we go now?

39:03.302 --> 39:04.970
Okay. All right. Great. We'll go.

39:06.763 --> 39:07.806
At dawn.

39:08.724 --> 39:09.725
Okay?

39:42.090 --> 39:46.345
Orion.

39:46.428 --> 39:50.933
I named my daughter after her. "Oranoos."

39:51.016 --> 39:55.145
She was strong. She glowed.

39:55.229 --> 39:56.522
Yeah.

39:57.147 --> 40:00.776
We actually used to watch the stars too.

40:01.318 --> 40:03.153
Rah's dad had this telescope.

40:03.237 --> 40:08.492
I mean, the lights drowned out
the whole sky and everything, but… yeah.

40:08.575 --> 40:12.955
They actually had this house
that was, like, way, way, way out,

40:13.038 --> 40:14.206
middle of nowhere.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.793
And when we first met,
you know, date number five,

40:19.127 --> 40:22.840
her parents weren't home,
and so she brought me there.

40:26.385 --> 40:29.263
I thought we were gonna get it on.

40:30.806 --> 40:31.807
But no.

40:32.558 --> 40:34.852
She just wanted to stare
at the lights up there.

40:37.521 --> 40:38.522
Oranoos.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.359
She was like you.

40:43.026 --> 40:46.113
Stubborn. Bothersome. Scared.

40:48.323 --> 40:51.660
But she was mine.

40:56.456 --> 40:58.584
Now, when I look up there, I just…

40:59.960 --> 41:01.461
I don't care what's up there.

41:03.505 --> 41:06.091
I just care about what's not here.

41:11.805 --> 41:16.393
She became sick in the winter.

41:17.603 --> 41:20.522
She died in the spring.

41:23.358 --> 41:26.403
I miss her.

41:26.486 --> 41:29.156
I miss her.

41:32.534 --> 41:36.121
I want her here. Not in the stars.

41:37.372 --> 41:38.457
Pain.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.460
All the bad stuff.

41:42.794 --> 41:44.379
You know, stuff…

41:45.797 --> 41:48.675
You know, the way they are.
The way they are 'cause of me.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.553
Yeah, whatever. Doesn't matter, man.

41:59.144 --> 42:02.105
It's nice to have someone to talk to.

42:07.236 --> 42:09.321
You don't even know
what I'm saying, do you?

42:09.404 --> 42:11.281
Someone to listen,

42:11.365 --> 42:13.408
but who can't understand.

42:13.492 --> 42:16.495
I don't even know what you're saying.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.121
It's nice.

42:19.790 --> 42:21.041
It's all good.

42:35.639 --> 42:38.141
I got some stuff. I got some stuff.

42:40.811 --> 42:44.231
Hey, hey, hey, no. I'm still Black. Okay?

42:45.566 --> 42:47.025
Shit.

43:09.381 --> 43:11.842
Hey. Hey, save your strength, Mr. E.

43:12.551 --> 43:13.677
It's all right.

43:14.887 --> 43:18.015
It was… raining. Raining.

43:20.267 --> 43:21.476
It was raining.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.395
Look, you've hit your head really hard,
okay?

43:23.478 --> 43:25.522
No. Not water.

43:26.231 --> 43:28.066
It was raining metal.

43:37.534 --> 43:39.244
You've got a fever.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.996
You're just saying things, all right?

43:41.079 --> 43:42.414
It's gonna be okay.

43:48.212 --> 43:49.213
I'm fine.

43:51.381 --> 43:52.382
Just rest.

44:46.395 --> 44:47.396
Impressive.

44:47.479 --> 44:48.480
You too.

44:51.358 --> 44:52.734
I…

44:53.360 --> 44:57.698
I meant what you did
for Mr. Edwards before. That-- That was…

45:02.494 --> 45:03.620
It was--

45:03.704 --> 45:04.955
I know what you mean.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.376
Must be cold in just that.

45:09.459 --> 45:11.461
My coat's too big. Big bruv's and all.

45:11.545 --> 45:14.631
No. I'm good, thanks.
Seriously. Seriously.

45:14.715 --> 45:16.008
Thank you though.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.177
Thanks and all.

45:19.553 --> 45:21.805
Right. You're all right.

45:23.765 --> 45:24.766
Night, neek.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.561
Night.

45:32.232 --> 45:34.568
Caspar the friendly ghost.

45:37.946 --> 45:38.947
That's me.

46:53.856 --> 46:54.857
Yamato-san!

46:55.482 --> 46:56.483
Oh, shit.

46:56.567 --> 46:58.026
Open the door!

46:59.570 --> 47:00.571
Open the door!

47:16.003 --> 47:20.382
A polar bear walks into a bar
and orders a gin…

47:21.049 --> 47:22.050
and tonic.

47:22.718 --> 47:24.595
The bartender asks,
"What's with the pause?"

47:25.345 --> 47:27.222
"These? I've had these all my life."

47:45.574 --> 47:48.076
Damn it, we don't have enough time.

48:34.581 --> 48:39.086
Why don't you want to let those guys
investigate the cause of the accident?

48:39.586 --> 48:41.505
Because I want to know

48:41.588 --> 48:43.131
what happened to Hinata.

48:56.728 --> 48:58.605
Whether it was my fault.

49:08.031 --> 49:09.032
Can you see that?

49:12.160 --> 49:13.161
What is that?

49:16.373 --> 49:17.833
I can't see anything.

49:28.218 --> 49:30.721
They collided with something.

49:33.056 --> 49:34.766
Did you hear that?

49:35.392 --> 49:36.602
Hear what?

49:47.404 --> 49:50.782
That explosion would have
killed them all instantly.

49:52.034 --> 49:54.161
Hurry up!

50:03.170 --> 50:04.630
Wajo.

50:06.673 --> 50:07.674
That's impossible.

50:15.807 --> 50:16.808
Wajo.

50:18.560 --> 50:19.561
Wajo.

50:20.229 --> 50:21.438
Wajo.

50:21.522 --> 50:24.650
Wajo. Wajo. Wajo.

50:24.733 --> 50:27.069
Wajo.

50:27.152 --> 50:31.865
Wajo. Wajo…
