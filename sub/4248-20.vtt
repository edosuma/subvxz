12:07.435 --> 12:09.812
- I SEE MY MESSAGE IS REALLY
GETTING THROUGH TO YOU.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.730
WANT A BUTTON?

12:11.814 --> 12:15.860
- THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US
TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.154
WHO'S FED UP
WITH HAVING TEXTBOOKS

12:18.237 --> 12:20.865
THAT DATE BACK FROM 1987?

12:20.948 --> 12:24.076
- M-A-R-A.
both: MARA.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.995
- WHO'S FED UP WITH THE MIRRORS
IN THE BATHROOMS

12:26.078 --> 12:27.163
MAKING YOU LOOK
LIKE A HORROR SHOW?

12:27.246 --> 12:29.081
[all cheering]

12:29.165 --> 12:30.499
AND BY YOU, I MEAN YOU, MARA.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.001
[all cheering]

12:32.084 --> 12:33.669
- WHO'S FED UP WITH LISTENING
TO PEOPLE

12:33.752 --> 12:35.880
WHO ACTUALLY
HAVE NOTHING TO SAY?

12:35.963 --> 12:36.839
- WHO'S FED UP WITH LIVING
IN THE SAME HOUSE

12:36.922 --> 12:39.842
AS THE SCHOOL'S
CHIEF BOYFRIEND-SNATCHER?

12:39.925 --> 12:43.637
- WHO'S FED UP YOU'RE
ONLY RUNNING FOR SCHOOL REP

12:43.721 --> 12:45.389
'CAUSE YOU'RE JEALOUS
MICK LIKES ME FAR MORE

12:45.473 --> 12:49.852
THAN HE EVER LIKED YOU?

12:49.935 --> 12:50.895
- I'M NOT SURE I EVER SAID THAT.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.318
- SEVEN.
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?

12:57.401 --> 12:59.361
- THERE ARE SEVEN ANKH PIECES.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.739
THEY MUST STILL BE HIDDEN
SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.407
IF ONLY WE HAD THE KEY.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.534
- THE KEY MUST BE DEAD BY NOW,
SURELY.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.203
- NOT NECESSARILY.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.246
- MR. SWEET, HAVE YOU SEEN

13:09.330 --> 13:11.373
THE LOCAL PAPER'S WRITE-UP
OF OUR PLAY?

13:11.457 --> 13:12.708
- JASON, JASON, HOW MANY TIMES
MUST I TELL YOU

13:12.791 --> 13:14.668
TO KNOCK BEFORE
YOU COME INTO MY OFFICE?

13:14.752 --> 13:18.839
- SORRY. SORRY. SORRY.
- MR. WINKLER.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.716
TELL ME, DID YOU EVER DISCOVER

13:20.799 --> 13:23.719
WHERE RUTTER, MARTIN,
AND WILLIAMSON

13:23.802 --> 13:25.846
DID THEIR RESEARCH
FOR THAT...

13:25.930 --> 13:27.723
THAT PLAY OF YOURS?

13:27.806 --> 13:31.602
- YES, I THINK THEY SAID
THAT THEY GOT THE IDEA

13:31.685 --> 13:35.105
FROM A LADY AT THE MUSEUM,
SARAH.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.776
- SARAH.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.827
- ALFIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

13:48.911 --> 13:50.079
- WHEN I WAS TIGHT
IN THE CELLAR,

13:50.162 --> 13:53.123
I REMEMBERED.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.375
I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.459
- WHAT DID YOU SEE?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.628
- MR. SWEET,

13:57.711 --> 13:59.547
MRS. ANDREWS, MR. WINKLER,

13:59.630 --> 14:01.340
AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE.

14:01.423 --> 14:05.135
THEY WERE CHANTING,

14:05.219 --> 14:07.846
AND THEY MENTIONED
THE CHOSEN ONE.

14:07.930 --> 14:14.061
AND VICTOR DRANK FROM A SKULL,
AND IT WAS HORRIBLE,

14:14.144 --> 14:17.398
AND ONE OF THEM WAS IN A MASK,
A DOG MASK.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.568
IT'S WHAT I DREAM ABOUT,

14:20.651 --> 14:23.445
THAT FACE JUST STARRING AT ME,

14:23.529 --> 14:24.905
COMING FOR ME.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.115
- ALFIE, IT'S OKAY.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.785
- I BET I KNOW WHAT HE
WAS DRINKING OUT OF THAT SKULL.

14:29.868 --> 14:31.620
- THE ELIXIR.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.955
- WHAT ELIXIR?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.790
- IT'S A POTION THEY MAKE
THAT KEEPS YOU YOUNG.

14:34.873 --> 14:38.419
- ANKH?
THAT WAS ANOTHER WORD.

14:38.502 --> 14:39.962
- THE CUP OF ANKH.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.839
THAT'S THE CUP THAT GIVES YOU
IMMORTALITY, RIGHT?

14:41.922 --> 14:46.635
- HELLO, VERY IMPORTANT STUFF
TO DISCUSS HERE.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.472
SO I'VE ONLY GOT 24 HOURS TO
MAKE SURE I WIN ELECTION FACTOR.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.516
HANDS UP, WHO'S GOING TO HELP ME
BLOW MARA OUT OF THE RACE?

14:55.519 --> 14:56.770
SOME CLUB.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.981
YOU PEOPLE ARE SO UNSUPPORTIVE.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.482
RUNNING AROUND
AFTER THE CUP OF MANK

15:00.566 --> 15:02.318
WHEN IT COULD BE
MY ONE CHANCE TO SHINE.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.319
THANKS.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.988
OH, AND BY THE WAY, ALFIE,
YOU'RE FIRED.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.326
- AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
THAT NO ONE OF THAT NAME

15:10.409 --> 15:14.079
WORKS AT THE MUSEUM?

15:14.163 --> 15:18.250
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.336
I SEE.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.880
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

15:29.053 --> 15:33.932
A DEAD END, CORVUS.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.727
- I THINK THE TEACHERS MUST BE
LOOKING FOR THE CUP OF ANKH TOO.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.520
WE HAVE TO FIND IT FIRST.
WE HAVE TO. WE JUST HAVE TO.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.898
- I KNOW. WE HAVE TO.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.524
IT FEELS LIKE WE'VE HIT
A DEAD END.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.692
NO MORE CLUES TO GO ON

15:43.776 --> 15:47.363
APART FROM THE EVER-SO-HELPFUL
"LISTEN TO THE VOICE."

15:47.446 --> 15:51.617
- WHAT IF IT MEANS LISTEN TO
SARAH'S VOICE, ON THE CYLINDERS?

15:51.700 --> 15:53.160
- DO YOU WANT TO DO IT NOW?
- NO.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.328
WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM
ON THE PHONOGRAPH.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.622
- WHY?

15:56.705 --> 15:58.207
- I THINK THAT'S WHY
I WAS DRAWN TO THE ATTIC

15:58.290 --> 15:58.916
AFTER MY VISIT TO SARAH.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.794
- AH, ONE OF YOUR <i> FEELINGS?</i>

16:01.877 --> 16:03.045
- YES.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.380
DO YOU HAVE TO SAY IT THAT WAY
EVERY TIME?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.340
<i>"FEELINGS."</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:07.883
- [chuckles]

16:07.966 --> 16:10.010
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

16:10.094 --> 16:13.764
LET'S OPEN OUR BOOKS
AT PAGE 62, PLEASE.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.599
- SORRY I'M LATE, MISS.
CAMPAIGN BUSINESS.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.736
- OH, HELLO, VICTOR.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.030
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT SINGING-OUT BOOK?

16:30.114 --> 16:32.700
- WHO IS THIS EMILY GRANT
THAT NINA KEEPS VISITING?

16:32.783 --> 16:35.536
- OH, SHE'S SOME LOVELY LADY
FROM THE OLD PEOPLE'S HOME

16:35.619 --> 16:38.288
THAT NINA'S KIND OF ADOPTED.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.666
- REALLY?

16:40.749 --> 16:41.667
[bell ringing]

16:41.750 --> 16:44.712
[all laughing]

16:48.090 --> 16:49.007
- [laughs]

16:52.553 --> 16:56.265
[all laughing]

16:58.517 --> 17:00.436
- WHAT'S WRONG, AMBER?

17:00.519 --> 17:01.395
DON'T LIKE PEOPLE SEEING YOU

17:01.478 --> 17:03.981
BEFORE ALL THE ACNE MEDICINE
AND BRACES?

17:04.064 --> 17:06.983
WHAT WAS YOUR POLICY
ABOUT ALWAYS LOOKING GOOD, HUH?

17:07.067 --> 17:09.028
[all laughing]

17:14.031 --> 17:16.201
- I HATE YOU, JEROME.
I HATE YOU.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.665
- ALL FAIR IN LOVE AND POLITICS,
EH?

17:21.749 --> 17:25.294
- YOU'RE A REALLY NASTY PIECE
OF WORK SOMETIMES, AREN'T YOU?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.962
- I'D BE CAREFUL IF I WERE YOU,
CAMPBELL.

17:27.045 --> 17:27.796
PEOPLE IN GLASS HOUSES...

17:27.880 --> 17:30.591
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

17:30.674 --> 17:33.260
- WELL, IN MY BOOK,
IT'S PRETTY NASTY

17:33.343 --> 17:36.555
TO KEEP SECRETS
FROM YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.728
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.104
WE'VE LISTENED
TO THESE ALL ALREADY.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.524
- THIS IS THE CYLINDER
THAT WAS BLANK, RIGHT?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.567
BUT WHY WAS IT BLANK?

17:48.650 --> 17:51.653
- BECAUSE IT WAS DAMAGED?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.906
- OR BECAUSE IT'S FAKE.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.491
- FAKE?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.951
- THIS CASING DOESN'T
LOOK RIGHT TO ME.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.661
LOOK, IT'S DIFFERENT
FROM THE OTHERS.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.957
I THINK IT MIGHT...

18:04.041 --> 18:05.375
COME OFF.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.211
[laughs]

18:07.294 --> 18:08.378
[gasps]

18:08.462 --> 18:11.256
- YOU'RE A GENIUS.
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.675
- "TO FIND THE SECRET
OF THE PAST,

18:13.759 --> 18:17.304
LOOK BEYOND THIS WORLD
THROUGH GLASS."

18:20.349 --> 18:22.100
[knocks at door]

18:24.269 --> 18:27.231
- COME TO TELL ME WHAT A MEAN,
HORRID PERSON I AM?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.734
- LISTEN, JEROME, I APPRECIATE
ALL YOUR HELP ON EVERYTHING,

18:30.818 --> 18:34.196
BUT I'M NOT
THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN TYPE.

18:34.279 --> 18:37.032
- I KNOW.

18:37.115 --> 18:41.954
YOU KNOW, I WISH I COULD BE
NORMAL LIKE YOU,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.248
DO THE RIGHT THING.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.667
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU FELT
WHEN YOUR PARENTS

18:46.750 --> 18:48.752
DROPPED YOU OFF HERE
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME?

18:48.836 --> 18:52.256
- YEAH, NERVOUS, NAUSEOUS,

18:52.339 --> 18:55.092
BUT I KNEW
THEY WEREN'T ABANDONING ME.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.511
THEY JUST WANTED ME
TO HAVE A GOOD FUTURE.

18:57.594 --> 19:01.890
- MY PARENTS
WANTED SOMETHING ELSE.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.436
TO GET RID OF ME.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.398
THEY LEFT ME HERE TO ROT.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.568
AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I DID.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.111
- YOU'RE NOT ROTTEN.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.243
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

19:21.326 --> 19:23.871
WHAT YOU SAID TO MICK
ABOUT PEOPLE IN GLASS HOUSES

19:23.954 --> 19:27.541
AND KEEPING SECRETS, IS HE--

19:27.624 --> 19:31.420
WAS HE SEEING SOMEONE
WHILST HE WAS AWAY?

19:31.503 --> 19:35.007
- I SO BADLY WANT TO SAY YES.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.094
BUT, HEY, I CAN'T.

19:39.177 --> 19:40.762
I GUESS YOU BRING OUT
THE BEST IN ME, MARA JAFFRAY.

19:40.846 --> 19:41.346
- SO WHAT?

19:54.109 --> 19:56.862
HE DIDN'T GET THE SCHOLARSHIP?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.281
- NO.

19:59.364 --> 20:02.284
- BUT WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL ME?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.494
- MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
LIKE KEEPING SECRETS.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.207
- SO YOU'RE AN OLD FRIEND,
YOU SAY?

20:09.291 --> 20:12.211
- OF THE FAMILY, YES, YES.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.338
MY FATHER KNEW HER.

20:14.421 --> 20:17.424
- EMILY.
EMILY.

20:17.507 --> 20:19.301
THERE'S A VISITOR HERE
TO SEE YOU.

20:19.384 --> 20:24.389
- ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO PROPOSE
A VISIT FOR EMILY.

20:24.473 --> 20:28.310
I WORK AT THE HOUSE
SHE GREW UP IN.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.355
I THOUGHT PERHAPS SHE MIGHT LIKE
TO VISIT THE OLD PLACE.

20:31.438 --> 20:34.024
- OH, WELL,
I'M SURE SHE'D LOVE TO.

20:34.107 --> 20:34.816
EMILY.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.194
OH, SHE'S SOUND ASLEEP.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.279
- WELL, LET HER SLEEP ON.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.950
I'LL WAIT.
PERHAPS A CUP OF TEA?

20:43.033 --> 20:45.035
- OF COURSE.
I'LL GET YOU ONE.

20:57.547 --> 21:01.051
- SARAH.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.096
IS THAT YOU?

21:04.179 --> 21:06.098
- VICTOR.
