00:02.070 --> 00:04.172
Previously on
Crime Scene Investigation...

00:04.205 --> 00:05.573
Christine?

00:06.607 --> 00:07.675
Mac.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.812
Christine?

00:11.845 --> 00:13.381
Christine?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.382
Where is she?

00:14.415 --> 00:16.084
What the hell is going on?

00:16.117 --> 00:19.587
RUSSELL:
We found Christine's phone
at a jewelry store robbery.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.589
The blood did match the blood
we found in the hotel room.

00:21.622 --> 00:22.823
Christine's room.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.458
RUSSELL:
We still don't
have an exemplar

00:24.492 --> 00:26.660
from New York, so we don't know
that it's her yet.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
What else you have?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.498
Okay, we found a print

00:30.531 --> 00:31.799
on the jeweler's safe.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.101
Hit came back

00:33.134 --> 00:35.169
to a James Boyd.
Jimmy Boyd?

00:35.203 --> 00:37.705
Boyd manages
Christine's restaurant.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.440
You son of a bitch.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.109
Where is she?
She's in New York.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.111
She never came to Vegas.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.113
What the hell
are you talking about?
I owe money

00:45.146 --> 00:46.814
to a loan shark
back in New York.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.217
What's this have to do
with Christine?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.051
I needed to use her
to pay him off.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.621
Where is she?

00:53.654 --> 00:54.855
She's with my brother;
my brother has her.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.723
You're gonna call him,

00:55.756 --> 00:57.325
and you're gonna tell him
it's over.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.126
I can't.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.727
Don't play with me, Jimmy.
Come on.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.397
The guy I owe-- he got nervous
and he grabbed them up.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.267
If I don't bring the diamonds
tomorrow night,

01:06.300 --> 01:07.768
they're dead.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.304
They're dead.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.308
I'm taking that bastard back
to New York

01:14.342 --> 01:15.876
with the diamonds.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.578
He's gonna pay off
the scumbag he owes.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.447
I'm gonna get Christine back.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.149
I'm not saying don't do this.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.552
I'm just saying
you're gonna need my help.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.621
I'm coming with you.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.667
(phone rings)

01:39.700 --> 01:41.335
BOYD:
Zane?

01:41.369 --> 01:42.903
That you, Boyd?
Yeah.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.572
I just got in from Vegas.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.407
So where do you want to meet?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.875
38th and Lex.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.344
Bring the diamonds.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.879
Shawn and Christine,

01:51.912 --> 01:53.747
you're gonna bring 'em, right?

01:53.781 --> 01:55.183
One hour, Boyd.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.218
Come alone.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.343
TAYLOR:
Christine was

02:22.376 --> 02:24.778
so excited about going to Vegas.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.214
They took her

02:26.247 --> 02:28.216
before she made it
out of New York.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.918
Mac, we're gonna get her back.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.455
FLACK:
I got visual confirmation.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.956
Two of them

02:35.989 --> 02:38.226
approaching
from the northwest corner.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.061
Yeah, we see them.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.930
Any sign of Christine
or Shawn Boyd?

02:42.963 --> 02:45.266
Negative.
What about you, Adam?

02:45.299 --> 02:46.367
Nothing on the traffic cams.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.236
Running as many plates as I can,

02:48.269 --> 02:49.603
but traffic's picking up.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.374
Big brother returns.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.313
Where are they?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.914
ZANE:
Close by.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.350
Diamonds?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.953
It's only fair.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.555
You owed me first.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.562
(beeping)

03:14.595 --> 03:16.697
I've got an image
of our two suspects.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.832
Adam, see if you can
get us more on Zane

03:18.866 --> 03:20.701
On it.
than just his first name.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.238
(beeping)

03:38.286 --> 03:40.654
They're all there,
just like we talked about.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.362
Six hours, Jimmy.

03:48.396 --> 03:51.365
Six hours in Vegas
we kept trying to call,

03:51.399 --> 03:53.267
but nobody
could get a hold of you.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.702
Not even your brother.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.670
BOYD:
I told you this--
things went bad.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.506
You think I'm stupid?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.040
Hey, hey, hey.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.575
Gun.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.643
I don't like this, Mac.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.678
We got a lot of people out here.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.680
He-he's testing him.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.417
TAYLOR:
Give it a second.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.318
Hey,

04:10.351 --> 04:12.386
please.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.988
Please put the gun back.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.658
What happened in those
six hours, Jimmy?

04:17.690 --> 04:19.360
Did you get caught?

04:19.392 --> 04:20.793
Trying to set me up?

04:20.827 --> 04:23.431
BOYD:
I just want my brother back.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.366
Please,
you got to believe me.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.868
I just want my brother back.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.406
He's gonna do it.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.541
Hold your position.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.380
Come.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.448
Let's go.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.682
Where?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.317
To get your brother
and the girl.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.553
You said you were gonna
bring 'em here.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.488
ZANE:
We have to take a ride first.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.856
Okay, that's not the plan.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.391
Flack, they're headed your way.

04:50.424 --> 04:51.825
I got 'em.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.895
Where are we going?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.897
You will see.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.937
You brought the cops?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.339
(screaming)

05:13.581 --> 05:15.583
(grunts)

05:18.151 --> 05:19.119
(grunts)

05:19.152 --> 05:20.354
(engine starts)

05:20.388 --> 05:22.956
(tires screeching)

05:22.990 --> 05:25.959
TAYLOR:
NYPD. Stop!

05:31.765 --> 05:33.434
Where is she?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.102
Where's Christine?

05:35.135 --> 05:36.570
RUSSELL:
Hey!

05:36.604 --> 05:38.071
My friend asked you a question.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.908
Your friend
won't like the answer.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.676
What'd you do to her?

05:42.710 --> 05:45.112
You will never see her again.

06:09.470 --> 06:13.607
* Out here in the fields

06:13.641 --> 06:16.510
* I fight for my meals

06:16.544 --> 06:22.382
* I get my back into my living

06:24.585 --> 06:26.687
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.101
Where is she being held?

06:41.134 --> 06:42.903
She must be important to you.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.472
You only ask about her.

06:44.505 --> 06:45.906
Who are you working with?

06:45.939 --> 06:46.974
Who's holding her?

06:47.007 --> 06:49.843
Leave it to the Boyd brothers

06:49.877 --> 06:52.179
to kidnap a cop's girlfriend.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.548
You took Christine and Shawn

06:54.582 --> 06:57.918
as collateral for the $100,000
he and his brother owed you.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.988
Everyone needs
insurance.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.895
Any word on Jimmy Boyd?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.897
He's still in surgery.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.998
When you questioned him
in Vegas,

07:11.031 --> 07:12.232
he give you anything on Zane?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.602
No, he said he only
met him once.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.937
Knew his first name, that's all.

07:16.970 --> 07:20.140
Said the guy was a loan shark
that he and his brother, Shawn,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.842
were borrowing
money from.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.076
What a mess.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.646
Guy's in my custody.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.648
I had to pull strings just
to bring him back to New York.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.782
(knocking)

07:28.816 --> 07:31.151
Do we know anything
more about this guy?

07:31.184 --> 07:32.986
I just got off the phone
with Adam.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.988
Facial recognition
was inconclusive.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.157
He ran his prints through AFIS,
got nothing back.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.959
He's running them
through Interpol now.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.228
How's it going in there?

07:41.261 --> 07:42.630
Not good.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.704
Did you do something to her?

07:52.706 --> 07:54.675
Is she alive?

07:54.708 --> 07:57.778
I'm done talking.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.931
(groans)

08:25.105 --> 08:27.608
You can end this.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.910
Just tell me
what you did with her.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.948
Go to hell.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.124
Tell me where she is.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.905
MAN:
They arrested Zane.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.139
I don't know.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.577
What do you want me to do?

09:03.611 --> 09:04.645
Yeah.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.046
I'll take care of it.

09:09.082 --> 09:09.850
You and your brother,

09:09.883 --> 09:12.019
you were working for the cops?
No.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.987
Huh?
What happened?
Where's Jimmy?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.322
He's dead.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.924
Jimmy's dead.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.992
You set us up!

09:19.026 --> 09:20.327
Huh?
I swear,

09:20.360 --> 09:21.895
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.064
I think you do,
I think you do.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.199
Don't shoot him.
Police have your friend.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.868
They're gonna figure
out where we are.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.002
If you kill us,

09:29.036 --> 09:31.004
then you'll lose the only
leverage that you've got.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.040
What kind of leverage
could you possibly be?

09:34.074 --> 09:38.045
My-my-my boyfriend's a cop.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.619
(sobbing)

09:47.921 --> 09:49.723
(shutter clicking)

09:56.930 --> 09:59.733
(grunts)

10:10.077 --> 10:12.746
Anything in your autopsy
point to who

10:12.780 --> 10:15.048
our John Doe is or where he may
have been in the last 24 hours?

10:15.082 --> 10:19.052
I found non-fatal acute
pulmonary inflammation.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.654
Something he inhaled

10:20.688 --> 10:22.389
within the last 24 hours

10:22.422 --> 10:24.792
caused irritation to the lining
of his lungs.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.126
I sent a sample to Tox.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.127
I also discovered

10:27.160 --> 10:28.796
his fillings

10:28.829 --> 10:30.898
are made of glass ionomer.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.335
These weren't don't
by any dentist in the U.S.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.804
From scarring

10:36.837 --> 10:38.071
on the surrounding gums,

10:38.105 --> 10:39.272
I'd say they're about
three months old.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.941
That tattoo on his bicep

10:40.974 --> 10:43.243
suggests he's from Egypt.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.278
It's from the story
of Seth and Apep.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.149
Seth and Apep.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.684
Um, Seth,

10:50.718 --> 10:53.320
the god of chaos,
protects Ra

10:53.353 --> 10:54.822
by beheading Apep,
the god of evil.

10:54.855 --> 10:55.956
It's an ancient Egyptian myth.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.126
So chaos destroying evil.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.294
Sounds like gang ideology.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.031
It could tie back
to a gang in Egypt.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.099
Or one here with Egyptian ties.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.110
(both grunt)

11:19.212 --> 11:24.051
* We spared souls

11:24.084 --> 11:25.719
* From plotting

11:25.753 --> 11:30.390
* Every move of your demise

11:30.423 --> 11:34.261
* Lead me to misbehave

11:34.294 --> 11:37.130
* So save my wicked soul

11:37.164 --> 11:39.833
* Stop me from the killing
that you know I love *

11:39.867 --> 11:43.203
* Hey

11:43.236 --> 11:47.775
* This lonely town

11:47.808 --> 11:50.143
* When I see you

11:50.177 --> 11:53.413
* Oh, hey

11:53.446 --> 11:57.084
* This lonely town

11:57.117 --> 12:00.253
* But I feel you

12:00.287 --> 12:03.156
* Under my skin.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.009
Hey.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.011
Hey, it looks like
our John Doe was

12:24.044 --> 12:25.445
keeping some kind
of a ledger.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.546
Well, we think
he's Egyptian.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.547
Would explain the Arabic.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.316
Yeah, I don't know what these

12:29.349 --> 12:31.051
numbers correspond to yet.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.285
Did you find anything in tox?

12:32.319 --> 12:35.355
Yeah, lung sample came back
positive for alpha-terpineol.

12:35.388 --> 12:38.058
All right, that's found
in fragrances, right?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.292
Well, unfortunately it's found
in everything from perfume

12:39.326 --> 12:42.362
to aftershave, making it
virtually impossible

12:42.395 --> 12:43.596
to narrow down
where he inhaled it.
(sighs)

12:43.630 --> 12:46.199
I feel so helpless, knowing that
Christine is out there alone.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.234
I know.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.469
We just got to stay
positive for Mac.
Yeah.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.804
(beeping)
Ah.

12:50.838 --> 12:51.805
What's this?

12:51.839 --> 12:53.406
I found this

12:53.440 --> 12:55.943
in his pocket but
I couldn't make it out.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.248
Nailah's
Cleaners.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.516
You said that tox detected
alpha-terpineol?

13:03.550 --> 13:06.920
That's found in industrial
fabric softeners.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.392
(garbled radio transmission)

13:13.493 --> 13:15.495
(breathing heavily)

13:20.000 --> 13:21.969
(Christine laughing)

13:22.002 --> 13:23.236
CHRISTINE: Bye.
MAN: Thanks for this.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.272
Okay, don't trip.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.242
That's the Christine you always

13:29.276 --> 13:31.912
talked about
at the academy?

13:49.396 --> 13:52.265
Mm, this is nice.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.437
I love you, Christine.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.144
Mac? Mac.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.114
Just got a hit on Interpol.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.318
"Zane Kalim."

14:11.351 --> 14:12.419
Wanted for murder in Egypt.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.121
Killed a member
of their parliament.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.288
About a year ago.

14:15.322 --> 14:16.423
Well, if he's been here
less than a year,

14:16.456 --> 14:17.958
chances are he's
working for someone.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.492
We need to find out who that is.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.493
FLACK:
Mac.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.029
This was left for you

14:22.062 --> 14:23.330
at the front desk.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.366
What is it?
I don't know.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.500
It just came in.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.383
(quiet gasp)

14:45.018 --> 14:46.653
(gasps)

15:05.072 --> 15:06.106
(car horn honking)

15:06.139 --> 15:08.608
(siren wailing)

15:27.760 --> 15:29.462
(screams)

15:29.496 --> 15:31.965
(sobbing)

15:46.079 --> 15:49.382
(phone ringing)

15:49.416 --> 15:51.384
Mac Taylor.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.620
(typing)

16:02.795 --> 16:05.032
15 minutes
to the call.

16:05.065 --> 16:08.401
This is a lot
for anyone to handle.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.103
Even Mac.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.005
He puts the burden of
the case on his shoulders

16:12.039 --> 16:13.773
even when it's a stranger.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.108
Now that it's Christine,

16:15.142 --> 16:16.776
it makes me worry

16:16.809 --> 16:18.378
for the people
he's after

16:18.411 --> 16:21.414
because he's not gonna
stop till he finds them.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.017
I know how he feels.

16:24.051 --> 16:27.154
Few months ago, my...

16:27.187 --> 16:29.556
my granddaughter was kidnapped.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.292
I would have done anything
to get her back.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.760
Tell me you found her.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.164
Yes, yeah, thanks
to the people around me.

16:38.265 --> 16:41.368
You know, Mac's lucky
to have you.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.270
All of you.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.777
All right,

16:50.810 --> 16:53.313
I'm linking to every phone
company in the tristate area.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.815
When the call comes in, I'll
determine the service provider,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.285
whether it be cell or landline,

16:58.318 --> 17:00.153
and then we can get
our trace on.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.096
Excuse me.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.153
LINDSAY:
Nailah Fayed?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.387
I'm Detective Messer,
this is Dr. Hawkes.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.256
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.125
NAILAH:
No, not at all.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.227
Do you recognize this man?

17:40.260 --> 17:43.130
No, I don't.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.664
This was his ticket.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.434
Seems he was
a customer of yours?

17:49.136 --> 17:52.139
Are you sure you
don't recognize him?

17:54.574 --> 17:56.743
He's no customer.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.479
He collects money
from me every week.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.813
In this neighborhood,

18:00.847 --> 18:02.882
you don't do
business for free.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.184
And how long has
that been going on?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.552
A few months.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.686
He says it's for protection,

18:06.719 --> 18:08.521
but it's Faraj we need
protection from.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.756
Faraj?

18:09.789 --> 18:11.258
I don't know his last name.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.091
Do you know where he lives?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.560
Does he have
any relatives in town?

18:15.262 --> 18:17.564
Have you ever seen him
with this man?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.499
He's come in with Faraj
once or twice.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.568
I don't know his name.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.337
This is a very tight community,
like a family.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.873
I can ask around, but

18:26.906 --> 18:28.408
people are scared.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.777
I don't think anyone's
going to say anything.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.713
I'm sorry, Detectives.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.815
I wish I could help more.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.185
Thank you.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.254
DNA came back on the tongue.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.589
Belongs to a male.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.723
Oh, thank God.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.392
If it's not Christine's,
whose is it?

18:45.425 --> 18:46.759
It could be Shawn Boyd's.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.861
I got 'em running it
through CODIS now.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.129
(phone ringing)

18:55.802 --> 18:57.870
Where the hell is Mac?

18:57.904 --> 18:59.272
What do you want to do?

18:59.306 --> 19:01.308
I'm taking it.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.376
Detective Jo Danville.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.511
Who am I speaking with?

19:04.544 --> 19:05.712
MAN (distorted):
There's a fountain

19:05.745 --> 19:07.214
in Fong's alley, Chinatown.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.681
Next to it is a bench.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.318
There will be instructions
waiting in an envelope.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.220
Where are Christine
and Shawn?

19:13.253 --> 19:14.321
If you want to see
them alive again,

19:14.354 --> 19:15.355
be at the bench

19:15.388 --> 19:16.956
in 15 minutes.
Keep him talking.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.792
We need to know
they're alive first.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.762
15 minutes.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.963
Hello?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.233
(beeping)

19:26.266 --> 19:27.267
Got it.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.935
Chelsea, 21st and Eighth.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.303
DANVILLE:
I'll call Flack.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.239
Danny, you head to Chinatown.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.474
(sirens wailing)

19:37.710 --> 19:40.347
It's transmitting
from right here.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.415
There's no one
over here.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.917
Signal hasn't moved
since Adam locked in on it.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.323
(phone beeps)

19:50.357 --> 19:51.924
(line ringing)

19:51.958 --> 19:53.960
Jo.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.934
Looks like a burner.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.370
DANNY:
Yeah, it's Messer.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.405
Danny, we struck out here--
what about you?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.840
No, there's no envelope here.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.242
What the hell's going on, Jo?

20:09.276 --> 20:10.643
Why make contact with us

20:10.677 --> 20:12.312
just to take us for a ride?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.781
We need to find Mac.

20:39.071 --> 20:43.242
*

20:54.454 --> 20:56.723
Mac, what are you doing?

20:56.756 --> 20:57.957
Damn it, D.B., you shouldn't
have followed me.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.927
I saw you leave the lab-- I
figured something was going on.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.462
Thought you might
need some backup.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.830
You have to leave now.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.965
They contacted you, didn't they?

21:05.998 --> 21:08.835
They had Christine call
my cell phone.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.870
(phone ringing)

21:13.573 --> 21:15.041
This is Mac Taylor.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.410
Mac, it's me.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.978
Christine? Thank God.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.847
Are you all right?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.382
Mac, listen.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.451
She gave me an address
of a warehouse.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.284
Said to come alone.

21:25.318 --> 21:27.019
Told me if I didn't,
they'd kill her.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.756
Well, Mac, they just
separated you from your team.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.458
Look, I know
what I'm doing, D.B.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.892
You of all people
should understand that.

21:32.925 --> 21:33.893
I do understand.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.961
That's why I'm here.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.429
I'm not trying to stop you,

21:36.463 --> 21:37.930
but I'm not gonna leave
you alone either.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.132
Look.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.569
I'll be close by--
they won't even know I'm there.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.834
*

22:44.831 --> 22:48.034
*

22:56.909 --> 22:58.911
(phone ringing)

23:00.447 --> 23:01.748
Taylor.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.416
Mac?

23:03.450 --> 23:04.150
Christine.

23:06.519 --> 23:07.787
"You proved you're
willing to work

23:07.820 --> 23:09.188
"alone.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.557
"Now we make a trade.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.191
Christine for Zane."

23:12.224 --> 23:14.527
Okay.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.495
Uh, I understand.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.129
I'll figure it out.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.397
Don't worry.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.001
"Bring him to Teterboro Airport,

23:22.034 --> 23:24.103
"hangar 20.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.137
One hour."

23:28.875 --> 23:31.678
Or they'll kill me, Mac.

23:31.711 --> 23:32.712
(sobbing):
No...

23:34.581 --> 23:35.815
Christine?

23:37.249 --> 23:38.451
Christine.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.897
So he's got blood
on his chin,

23:50.930 --> 23:52.064
but no
pooling

23:52.098 --> 23:53.032
on the ground.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.601
The lingual artery
supplies blood

23:54.634 --> 23:55.602
to the
tongue,

23:55.635 --> 23:56.969
and if it was
severed here,

23:57.003 --> 23:59.105
let's just say
we'd be looking at

23:59.138 --> 24:00.172
a much
bigger mess.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.108
He was killed somewhere else,
then dumped here.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.177
And Mac called it in.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.947
They must've wanted him
to find it.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.149
Maybe the kidnappers
contacted him.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.618
That's exactly what happened.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.189
15 minutes
to the call.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.160
DANNY:
That's why they got us

24:21.193 --> 24:22.194
running all
over town,

24:22.228 --> 24:24.163
so Mac would be here alone.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.832
So what's our
next move?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.834
Mac feels he needs to go
with this alone,

24:27.867 --> 24:28.968
we need to trust him.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.803
Our job is to follow
the science,

24:30.837 --> 24:32.071
just like any other case.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.881
FLACK:
Where the hell

24:41.914 --> 24:43.916
have you been? Everybody's been
looking for you.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.985
Where is he, Flack?
Where's Zane?

24:46.018 --> 24:47.186
He's in holding.
But not for long.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.755
What do you mean?
Once Zane's

24:48.788 --> 24:49.722
fingerprints got a hit
in Interpol,

24:49.756 --> 24:51.524
the, uh, Department of Justice
was alerted.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.893
They're taking him
into federal custody.
Yeah.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.928
Two U.S. Marshals are
on their way over now.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.531
Well, has-has his provisional
warrant been signed yet?

24:58.565 --> 24:59.365
Yeah, it's a done deal.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.200
Once those guys walk
through the door,

25:01.233 --> 25:03.603
he's no longer
our prisoner.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.704
Well, until
they get here,

25:04.737 --> 25:06.639
he's still ours.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.610
*

25:30.763 --> 25:32.064
I tested
the blood.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.332
It's a match
for Shawn Boyd.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.835
DANVILLE:
It's awfully intricate

25:35.868 --> 25:36.836
to draw as you're dying.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.304
Well, I don't think he did it.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.840
There's no traces of
blood on his fingers.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.274
Well, if Shawn
didn't draw it,

25:42.308 --> 25:43.309
then who did?

25:45.211 --> 25:47.614
This eye is
a fingerprint.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.648
Hmm.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.319
(whirring)

26:08.768 --> 26:10.369
Christine.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.838
New York State requires
fingerprints

26:11.871 --> 26:13.840
for anyone who gets
a liquor license.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.341
She knew the body
would end up here.

26:15.374 --> 26:16.943
Christine's trying
to tell us something.

26:16.976 --> 26:17.944
We got to find out

26:17.977 --> 26:19.578
what this symbol means.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.349
Looks like this guy
kept records

26:23.382 --> 26:25.317
of all his collections,
and by the looks of it,

26:25.351 --> 26:26.886
he was pulling in
several thousand a week.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.721
Can you pull up a map of
all the addresses listed?

26:28.755 --> 26:30.289
I'm one step ahead of you.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.294
ROSS:
All these places are

26:35.327 --> 26:37.596
businesses in Little Egypt.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.300
Do you recognize
one of the locations?

26:41.333 --> 26:42.669
No.

26:42.702 --> 26:43.736
But I should.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.005
Nailah's cleaner
isn't on this map.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.807
Do you recognize
this man?

26:47.840 --> 26:50.677
He collects money
from me every week.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.712
She was lying.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.715
A trade?

26:55.748 --> 26:56.849
If I don't
do it,

26:56.883 --> 26:57.850
they're gonna
kill her.

26:57.884 --> 27:00.286
"Now we make a trade.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.821
"Christine for Zane.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.823
"Bring him to Teterboro Airport,

27:03.856 --> 27:04.824
"hangar 20.

27:04.857 --> 27:06.392
One hour."

27:06.425 --> 27:08.695
Or they'll kill me, Mac.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.362
(sobbing)

27:10.396 --> 27:12.364
Then we talk to the marshals.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.266
There's an innocent life
at stake; they'll play ball.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.401
Not before
running it up

27:15.434 --> 27:16.736
to the attorney
general's office.

27:16.769 --> 27:17.904
We don't have
that kind of time.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.005
Then we ask for more time.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.406
These men
aren't patient.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.408
They've already proven
they'll kill to make a point.

27:22.441 --> 27:23.409
You said it yourself:

27:23.442 --> 27:25.044
there's an innocent life
at stake.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.014
I can't take any
chances, Don.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.918
Not on this one.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.452
So what?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.454
We just...

27:35.487 --> 27:37.156
spring the dude and walk him
out the front door

27:37.189 --> 27:38.925
as the federal marshals
are walking in?

27:42.128 --> 27:43.662
Yes.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.237
I'm here to
take him out.

27:53.239 --> 27:54.240
(door buzzes)

28:01.013 --> 28:02.114
Fellas.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.349
You must be Detective Flack.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.184
I am. Thank you
for coming.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.287
Can't wait to get
this guy off my hands.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.923
All right, I'll just look
this over real quick.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.696
Let's go.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.523
Hey, sorry, I got hung up there.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.758
Are these the guys

28:45.792 --> 28:47.526
that are here
for Zane Kalim?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.528
Yeah. This is
Detective Russell,

28:49.561 --> 28:50.462
out of Vegas.

28:50.496 --> 28:51.998
He helped us apprehend Kalim.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.033
Appreciate
your help.
Yeah. Yeah.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.978
RUSSELL:
Um... boy, I just better
come clean here.

29:06.012 --> 29:08.247
If you go on back
to the cells,

29:08.280 --> 29:09.481
you're not gonna
find Kalim.

29:09.515 --> 29:10.850
So where
is he?

29:10.883 --> 29:11.851
Go ahead,
tell 'em.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.021
He was taken over
to the 88 in Brooklyn.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.256
I got a uni picking
him up right now.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.291
It's all right.
Actually, you know,

29:19.325 --> 29:20.392
it's my fault.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.261
Uh, when I was
booking Kalim,

29:22.294 --> 29:23.930
I-I filled out the wrong...

29:23.963 --> 29:26.032
the wrong form.
(chuckles)

29:26.065 --> 29:27.867
Those damn things
look so different

29:27.900 --> 29:30.870
in Vegas, and I'm a little
tired to tell you the truth.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.504
Uh, tell you what.

29:32.538 --> 29:33.505
In the meantime,

29:33.539 --> 29:35.141
we will...

29:35.174 --> 29:37.009
we'll grab a cup of coffee
while we wait?

29:37.043 --> 29:38.044
Yeah.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.546
Fellas, I'm so sorry.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.882
You know what? I
wouldn't worry about it.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.050
I'm, uh...

29:44.083 --> 29:45.885
I'm pretty sure
that our guy's, uh...

29:45.918 --> 29:47.219
walking him out
of the precinct

29:47.253 --> 29:48.220
as we speak.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.468
LINDSAY:
Faraj kept a detailed ledger

30:02.501 --> 30:04.837
of every collection he's made
over the past two months.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.238
There's no mention of Nailah's

30:06.272 --> 30:07.573
or her dry cleaners.

30:07.606 --> 30:08.975
Why leave her off the list?

30:09.008 --> 30:10.009
Because.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.510
He's not collecting
from her,

30:11.543 --> 30:12.845
it's the other
way around.

30:12.879 --> 30:13.880
Nailah immigrated
to the U.S.

30:13.913 --> 30:14.847
about ten years ago.

30:14.881 --> 30:17.116
When she was applying
for her green card,

30:17.149 --> 30:18.617
she legally changed
her name to Fayed.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.886
What was it before?

30:19.919 --> 30:21.253
Kalim.
Just like Zane.

30:21.287 --> 30:22.521
Exactly like Zane.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.555
They're brother
and sister.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.991
Being related
to someone

30:25.024 --> 30:26.425
doesn't make you
guilty of their crime.

30:26.458 --> 30:27.593
ROSS:
True, but

30:27.626 --> 30:29.161
this doesn't
help her case.

30:29.195 --> 30:32.031
HAWKES:
That's the same
symbol Christine left

30:32.064 --> 30:33.565
on Shawn Boyd's body.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.234
It's on a restaurant
in Little Egypt

30:35.267 --> 30:37.169
directly across the street
from Nailah's dry cleaners.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.437
Christine could
have seen that

30:38.470 --> 30:40.006
from wherever
she's being held.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.941
That's what she's
trying to tell us.

30:41.974 --> 30:44.610
She's at Nailah's.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.976
*

31:17.643 --> 31:20.146
Come alone?

31:20.179 --> 31:22.648
Show me Christine.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.883
Where's Zane?

31:29.021 --> 31:31.557
(muffled grunting)

31:31.590 --> 31:33.125
Satisfied?

31:35.694 --> 31:36.996
Now let me see Christine.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.098
First take him out.
Hand him over.

31:39.131 --> 31:41.533
Then I'll tell you where
your girlfriend's being held.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.372
Change of plan.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.176
Now we're gonna go get
Christine together,

31:50.209 --> 31:52.078
or I'm gonna shoot you dead
right now.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.348
Aah!

32:09.461 --> 32:10.429
Where is she?

32:10.462 --> 32:11.463
(grunts)

32:13.432 --> 32:14.466
(yells)

32:14.500 --> 32:16.402
(groans)

32:17.736 --> 32:19.705
I'm tired of playing games.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.673
Let's play
one of mine.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.985
Hey.

32:33.019 --> 32:33.986
We'll see
how far

32:34.020 --> 32:36.088
you're willing
to go.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.523
Hey!

32:38.557 --> 32:39.658
Tell me when
you've had enough.

32:39.691 --> 32:40.759
Wait!
(dry fires)

32:40.792 --> 32:42.128
Hey, please!

32:42.161 --> 32:43.029
Please!

32:43.062 --> 32:43.595
Where's Christine?

32:45.131 --> 32:46.632
(dry fires)
No, no!

32:46.665 --> 32:47.666
I'll take you to her!

32:48.500 --> 32:49.668
I'll take you to her!

33:12.491 --> 33:14.693
How many men are holding her?

33:14.726 --> 33:16.628
Just one.
Where?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.064
In the back.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.802
What's his name?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.105
Ahmed.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.785
This him?

33:39.818 --> 33:41.453
Yeah.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.058
(line ringing)

33:46.092 --> 33:49.095
Tell him to bring her outside.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.430
Don't try anything.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.732
This one's full of bullets.

33:53.765 --> 33:56.102
(line continues ringing)

34:00.339 --> 34:02.208
Where the hell is he?

34:02.241 --> 34:04.176
I don't know.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.045
This is Ahmed. Leave a message.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.717
All right.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.822
Let's go.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.926
(door opens)

34:20.958 --> 34:23.762
Nailah Fayed, we have a warrant
to search the premises.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.531
Or should we call you
Nailah Kalim?

34:25.563 --> 34:26.864
LOVATO:
Don't make me chase you.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.202
Then I'm gonna have
to shoot you.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.272
Is there anybody else
in the building?

34:33.304 --> 34:35.072
No.

34:47.553 --> 34:48.853
Which way?

34:48.887 --> 34:51.089
Over there.

34:53.192 --> 34:56.128
Where?
Over here.

35:22.488 --> 35:23.622
Clear.

35:28.694 --> 35:31.297
Where?
Back there.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.186
I got blood.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.160
She was here.

36:08.967 --> 36:12.170
So where is she now?

36:13.839 --> 36:15.641
(machinery rattling)

36:34.260 --> 36:37.229
Hey, Ahmed.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.964
Get the girl.
Bring her up front.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.979
Ahmed...
(shouts indistinctly)

37:21.873 --> 37:23.609
Christine, Christine.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.377
(sobbing)

37:25.411 --> 37:27.913
Thank God, Mac.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.681
(sobbing)

37:29.715 --> 37:31.850
Shh. It's okay,
it's okay. Okay.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.686
(sobbing)

37:34.720 --> 37:39.591
It's okay, it's okay.
You're safe now. You're safe.

37:41.893 --> 37:45.364
I knew you'd come for me.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.466
Always.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.306
I love you, Mac.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.343
I love you, too.

37:57.376 --> 37:58.076
(sobbing)

37:58.109 --> 38:00.312
It's okay.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.348
I love you.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.450
I love you, too.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.321
(siren wailing)

38:19.398 --> 38:20.699
What'd the marshals say?

38:20.732 --> 38:23.101
They were pissed.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.770
But they'll get over it.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.405
Not much you can do.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.607
Clerical errors tend to happen
from time to time.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.776
Clerical errors, huh?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.978
Yup.

38:39.585 --> 38:40.118
Hey, Jo.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.788
Oh, Mac.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.023
Thank God
we got Christine back.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.392
How is she?

38:46.425 --> 38:48.126
Thankful it's over.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.828
Yeah.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.096
We took her to
Trinity General.

38:51.129 --> 38:54.065
So this is Zane's sister?

38:54.099 --> 38:57.068
And the woman behind the
blossoming crime family.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.470
The laundry was her front.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.105
I'm on my way to interrogate her
and find out

39:00.138 --> 39:01.940
what else she was hiding.

39:01.973 --> 39:05.544
I'm sorry I kept you
in the dark.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.414
If there was any other way...

39:08.447 --> 39:10.015
I know.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.423
Oh, one more thing.
The guy you arrested-- Omar.

39:17.456 --> 39:20.426
He told this wild story
about playing

39:20.459 --> 39:21.627
a game of Russian roulette.

39:21.660 --> 39:24.496
You wouldn't happen
to know anything
about that, would you?

39:32.471 --> 39:33.371
Hey...

39:33.405 --> 39:35.407
Let's see how far
you're willing to go.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.608
(gun dry fires)

39:36.642 --> 39:39.878
Not much of a game
when the gun's empty.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.154
(car horn honking)

40:03.869 --> 40:06.037
(knocking)

40:06.071 --> 40:08.440
Just when you think you got
a moment to yourself,

40:08.474 --> 40:10.141
somebody knocks on your door.

40:10.175 --> 40:13.745
(chuckles)
Well, I guess that's the job
we signed up for.

40:13.779 --> 40:17.115
There's got to be some perk
to being the boss, right?

40:17.148 --> 40:19.818
Yeah, the seminar in Hawaii
comes to mind.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.653
Yeah, that would do it,
that would do it.

40:21.687 --> 40:22.554
(chuckles)

40:22.588 --> 40:25.891
How's Christine doing?

40:25.924 --> 40:27.659
She's coming along.

40:27.693 --> 40:28.660
I was just about

40:28.694 --> 40:30.729
to head back to
the hospital.

40:30.762 --> 40:33.899
I guess it's your turn
to take care of her, huh?

40:35.734 --> 40:38.904
Yeah, it is.

40:42.574 --> 40:45.677
So, when are you taking off?

40:45.711 --> 40:47.112
Uh, first thing in the morning.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.680
And Boyd?

40:48.714 --> 40:50.015
He made it out
of surgery,

40:50.048 --> 40:52.217
so, as soon as he's safe
to travel,

40:52.250 --> 40:53.885
they'll transfer him back
to Vegas

40:53.919 --> 40:56.522
and have him stand trial
for the murder of Sadat.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.893
D.B., I can't thank you enough
for coming back here with me.

41:01.927 --> 41:03.028
Hey...
No, no.

41:03.061 --> 41:04.863
You stuck
your neck

41:04.896 --> 41:06.765
way out on the line.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.867
Much more than I could
have asked for.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.837
I want you to know
how grateful I am.

41:14.606 --> 41:16.107
Thank you.

41:16.141 --> 41:19.878
Next time we come to
Vegas, dinner's on me.

41:19.911 --> 41:21.680
Damn right.
(chuckles)

41:21.713 --> 41:23.682
I'm gonna bring
my whole family, too.
