00:00.001 --> 00:01.289
<i>Previously
on "Devious Maids"...</i>

00:01.389 --> 00:03.724
<i>Are you saying that my
client is the father?</i>

00:03.759 --> 00:06.939
<i>No. He knows who is,
and they are very close.</i>

00:06.939 --> 00:08.340
Do you know
who they're talking about?

00:08.375 --> 00:09.942
I can't help you.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.277
Marisol, Michael Stappord

00:11.311 --> 00:13.245
is going to get
a phone call very soon.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.247
Do me a favor
and listen to it, okay?

00:15.282 --> 00:16.515
What are you doing?

00:16.550 --> 00:17.884
I caught marisol
eavesdropping.

00:17.918 --> 00:18.584
Keep an eye on her.

00:18.618 --> 00:20.086
See what she's up to.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.988
(Gasps and screams)
(Tires screech)

00:22.022 --> 00:23.556
You didn't call
an ambulance?

00:23.590 --> 00:25.624
That woman is evil,
and I want to see her punished.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.126
She will be.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.361
Mr. Spence? I want you
to leave your wife.

00:29.396 --> 00:30.830
I have this maid.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.331
And I want to do
something nice for her.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.433
I'm gonna fly to Mexico
and go get her little boy.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.735
Genevieve and I
have been spending

00:35.769 --> 00:37.503
a lot of time together lately,
and, uh,

00:37.537 --> 00:38.905
I asked her to marry me.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.606
I will not bless that man.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.274
Why don't you just
shut up?!

00:42.309 --> 00:43.475
(Grunts)
Ohh!

00:43.510 --> 00:45.044
Since when are you
such a fan of Scott's?

00:45.079 --> 00:47.379
Well, I've gotten to know him
these last few days,

00:47.414 --> 00:48.514
and we've become close.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.083
Then maybe you can
do me a favor.

00:50.117 --> 00:51.617
(Voice breaking)
Alejandro...

00:51.651 --> 00:53.552
He doesn't want
to date you anymore.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.923
So Alejandro Rubio
is into guys?

00:56.957 --> 00:59.192
How soon before
the story hits the press?

01:07.067 --> 01:10.502
Why do we come here?
These prices are ridiculous.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.171
I'll need to borrow money.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.606
Again?

01:13.640 --> 01:14.907
It's not my fault
I'm broke.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.408
But it's your fault
I'm broke.

01:16.443 --> 01:18.544
Oh, Rosie, loosen up
the purse strings, for God sake.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.546
Hmm... (Clicks tongue)

01:20.580 --> 01:24.583
(Speaks indistinctly) So,
Carmen, how's your love life?

01:24.618 --> 01:26.485
- Don't ask.
- What about Sam?

01:26.519 --> 01:28.187
I thought you loved him.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.222
I do.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.389
So why aren't you
seeing him?

01:30.423 --> 01:31.690
We had a fight.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.325
And he went away.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.128
Why not call him?

01:35.162 --> 01:36.262
He should call me.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.797
He knows I'm busy
with my career.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.066
And why are we talking
about my love life?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.034
There is a guy
sitting over there

01:42.069 --> 01:43.669
who is staring at you.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.573
He's not really my type.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.308
<i>But...</i>

01:49.342 --> 01:50.609
Come here.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.745
What are you doing?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.247
(Chuckles)
If I flirt with him,

01:54.281 --> 01:55.948
maybe he'll pay for lunch.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.950
- But if you're not into him...
- shh!

01:57.985 --> 02:00.052
- Let her work her magic.
- Okay.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.553
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.022
I'm Zach Fowler.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.557
These are my friends...
Marisol and Rosie.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.626
- And I am...
- Carmen Luna.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.729
- I know.
- How do you know that?

02:10.764 --> 02:12.131
Oh, I'm a reporter.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.599
I work for
"celebrity dirt."

02:13.633 --> 02:15.501
That trashy Internet site?

02:15.535 --> 02:17.503
Don't hate me 'cause
I'm slimy. (Chuckles)

02:17.537 --> 02:18.771
(Laughter)

02:18.806 --> 02:20.106
So why would
you recognize me?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.774
I'm not a celebrity... yet.
(Chuckles)

02:21.809 --> 02:24.110
You're
Alejandro Rubio's maid.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.745
I've taken pictures of you
coming out of his house.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.115
Hey, for all you know,
I'm his girlfriend.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.250
(Laughs) Yeah.
(Laughs)

02:31.285 --> 02:32.618
Come on.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.854
We both know he doesn't
swing that way.

02:40.393 --> 02:45.464
Oh. Well, am I right?
Is Alejandro Rubio gay?

02:47.400 --> 02:50.136
You know what?
I'm not really hungry anymore.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.270
Rosie?

02:51.305 --> 02:52.438
Me neither.
(Chairs scrape floor)

02:52.472 --> 02:54.207
Come on, Carmen.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.642
Oh. We've been told that
he broke up with his boyfriend.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.644
Just say, "no comment."

02:58.678 --> 02:59.645
No comment.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.581
- We just need confirmation.
- No comment... (Speaks Spanish)

03:02.615 --> 03:05.251
Naturally, we'd pay you.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.053
As much as $10,000.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.326
What are you doing?

03:13.360 --> 03:18.497
And all you'd have to do
is tell us the truth.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.734
Carmen, let's go.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.669

04:14.354 --> 04:15.754
What's wrong?

04:15.789 --> 04:19.257
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.260
I thought I was being
molested.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.694
Well, normally
I wouldn't presume,

04:22.729 --> 04:25.564
but you were having
an erotic dream.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.266
How do you know that?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.270
Oh.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.105
(Clears throat)
So...

04:33.140 --> 04:35.607
Now that you're up...
So to speak,

04:35.642 --> 04:37.343
would you like to...

04:37.377 --> 04:39.378
No, I'm not in the mood.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.880
That's not what
your body says.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.849
I was dreaming
of our stock portfolio.

04:43.883 --> 04:45.651
IBM hit a 52-week high.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.420
I almost climaxed.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.789
Please, don't make jokes.
Not about this.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.959
I'm sorry.
(Door opens)

04:56.163 --> 04:57.629
Who were you really
dreaming of?

04:58.064 --> 05:01.132
Who do you think?

05:01.167 --> 05:06.204
I'm so glad she's dead.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.776
(Cans clatter)

05:10.810 --> 05:12.978
She was offered how much?!

05:13.012 --> 05:16.815
The reporter will give Carmen
$10,000 to out Alejandro.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.051
I hope she told him
to slither back to his swamp.

05:20.086 --> 05:21.387
Carmen's broke.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.088
I think she may be
considering it.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.823
Well, it's not right.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.959
And the people we work for
deserve our discretion.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.663
Really? You'd turn down $10,000
for a few family secrets?

05:31.698 --> 05:34.366
I would. And the stuff
that I have on the Delatours

05:34.401 --> 05:36.368
is worth twice that.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.969
Really?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.588
They have skeletons
in their basement?

05:39.589 --> 05:41.172
Closet.

05:41.207 --> 05:44.276
How do you bury skeletons
in a closet?

05:44.310 --> 05:46.812
So the Delatours have secrets?

05:46.846 --> 05:50.115
Last week, we had this
ugly family get-together.

05:50.149 --> 05:52.217
(Gasps) What happened?

05:52.251 --> 05:55.253
Remi punched his father
in the face.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.623
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.391
Phillipe was being a jerk,
and Remi lost it.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.460
I've never seen him
so angry.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.429
And then this weird thing
happened.

06:03.463 --> 06:06.632
Remi whispered something
to his dad,

06:06.666 --> 06:08.166
and Phillipe went white
as a sheet.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.102
When did this happen?

06:11.137 --> 06:13.439
Last Friday. Why?

06:13.473 --> 06:16.909
- No reason. Just...
- (Genevieve) Zoila!

06:16.943 --> 06:18.143
What?!

06:18.177 --> 06:21.012
<i>I found a gray hair!</i>

06:21.047 --> 06:22.213
So?

06:22.248 --> 06:25.216
<i>It's in my wig. I'm confused.</i>

06:25.251 --> 06:26.117
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)

06:26.152 --> 06:28.286
I need to go.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.928
- Bye.
- We'll see you later.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.191
Rosie?

06:33.225 --> 06:36.495
- This is Phillipe, right?
- Mm-hmm. Yes it is.

06:38.798 --> 06:42.734
I hate to admit it,
but he is handsome.

06:42.769 --> 06:45.003
As the devil.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.014
I worry about you.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.817
Why?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.919
You're so lonely.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.020
I am?

07:02.054 --> 07:03.121
It's sad.

07:03.155 --> 07:06.859
You never go out.
You never date.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.861
I think it's time for you
to kick that closet door open

07:08.895 --> 07:11.329
and let the world know
you're a happy gay boy.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.465
Are you crazy?

07:13.500 --> 07:17.102
Think about it.
You can finally be yourself.

07:17.136 --> 07:20.939
- Meet guys. Have a life.
- And risk my career?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.041
No, thanks.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.277
Well...

07:26.312 --> 07:30.248
What if people find out
the truth somehow?

07:30.282 --> 07:32.985
Um, you can handle that,
right?

07:33.019 --> 07:35.253
No.

07:35.287 --> 07:37.322
- You see, I bet you could.
- I couldn't.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.257
- You're so strong.
- Not really.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.859
- I'll bet ya.
- Carmen!

07:40.894 --> 07:43.228
If people found out I was gay,
I would be devastated.

07:43.262 --> 07:44.830
Only at first.

07:44.864 --> 07:48.199
But then you'll live your life
like an openly gay man.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.101
And you can go to bars
and clubs.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.018
And before you know it, you'll
be the belle of the balls... ball.

07:53.373 --> 07:54.740
Ball.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.708
Why are you asking me this?

07:56.743 --> 08:00.846
No reason. Hmm.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.284
Have you heard something?
Are people talking about me?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.718
Why are you getting upset?

08:06.753 --> 08:09.855
We were having such a fun talk
about you being lonely.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.692
Well, maybe I am
a bit isolated.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.794
But that's the price I pay
for success.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.730
But you don't have to choose
between work and a relationship.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.267
Sometimes you do.
I put my career first.

08:21.301 --> 08:25.438
Come on. You of all people
should understand.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.738
That's why I know
you're gonna make it.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.640
You're just like me.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.709
You need success
more than you need love.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.417
(Spritzes)
(Door closes)

08:41.354 --> 08:43.089
(Sighs) You're back!

08:43.123 --> 08:44.890
I didn't expect you
until noon.

08:44.924 --> 08:47.593
My flight got in early.
Where's Peri?

08:47.627 --> 08:50.329
- She's still at work.
- And the baby?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.531
- He's asleep.
- So...

08:52.566 --> 08:54.467
We're alone?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.902
I guess so.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.574
(Moans)

09:01.608 --> 09:05.478
- God, I've missed kissing you.
- Oh, me, too.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.013
Mm. Were you surprised
to get my call?

09:08.047 --> 09:11.650
- Yeah. What changed your mind?
- It doesn't matter.

09:11.684 --> 09:15.387
The good news is that
we can be together now,

09:15.422 --> 09:19.425
and I don't have to feel guilty
about loving you. (Gloves snap)

09:19.459 --> 09:21.693
Or...

09:21.728 --> 09:25.264
Rosie Falta,
will you do me the honor...

09:25.298 --> 09:27.600
No! No! No!
I know what you're thinking.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.800
You're thinking that
this is too fast.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.402
That's not
what I'm thinking.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.037
But I can be divorced
from Peri within the month.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.905
- So... ow!
- I said no!

09:33.940 --> 09:35.941
- Damn it!
- What's with the violence?

09:35.975 --> 09:37.909
- You can't propose now.
- Why not?

09:37.944 --> 09:39.678
I'm sweating like a pig.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.147
I got baby spit
on my top...

09:41.181 --> 09:43.849
(Whiny voice) And I'm pretty
sure I smell like bug spray.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.551
Oh, is that what that is?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.553
(Normal voice) I want
to remember this moment

09:47.587 --> 09:49.021
for the rest of my life.

09:49.055 --> 09:53.392
I want to look nice for it. I...
I want it to be romantic.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.795
I'm asking you to spend
all of eternity with me.

09:56.829 --> 09:58.864
The fact that I'm willing
to do that...

09:58.898 --> 10:00.366
When, quite frankly,
you've never looked worse...

10:00.400 --> 10:02.368
Seems very romantic to me.

10:04.504 --> 10:07.105
(Sighs)

10:07.140 --> 10:09.508
(Gasps) No.

10:09.543 --> 10:14.012
I have to put it on a chain
so Mrs. Peri doesn't see.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.614
Wear it any place you like.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.516
I'll still be the happiest
man on earth. (Chuckles)

10:19.952 --> 10:21.387
(Moans)
(Moans)

10:21.421 --> 10:23.355
These... these bugs
you've killed...

10:23.390 --> 10:25.023
They really put up
a fight, huh?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.759
Just go.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.965
(Exhales deeply)

10:34.000 --> 10:37.102
(Footsteps approaching)

10:42.642 --> 10:45.944
- We need to talk.
- Obviously.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.948
I was waiting to make sure
we had the house to ourselves.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.183
You gonna hit me again?

10:51.218 --> 10:52.751
No.

10:52.785 --> 10:57.089
Good. 'Cause next time
I'll hit back. (Chuckles)

10:57.123 --> 10:59.157
You should ditch
the smile.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.159
I'm about to call
the police.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.062
And you'll tell them what?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.599
You killed Flora Hernandez.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.668
What a stupid thing to say.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.803
There's a tape, dad.
I saw it.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.839
A tape of what?

11:13.873 --> 11:16.508
Flora telling your lawyer
that you raped her.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.810
He offers her money.
She wants more.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.648
Now that's a negotiation.
Not murder.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.217
She then told your lawyer
she was pregnant with my child.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.887
She was killed
two days later.

11:28.921 --> 11:32.224
You did it.
I know you did.

11:34.728 --> 11:35.994
Do you really want to think

11:36.028 --> 11:39.064
that your own father
is capable of murder?

11:39.098 --> 11:42.100
I don't want to.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.671
That young woman
was an extortionist.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.742
I'm sure there were...
Many people who wanted her dead.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.843
So what?

11:51.878 --> 11:54.647
It was a coincidence she died?
We just lucked out?

11:54.681 --> 11:58.917
I'd hate to say it that way,
but yes.

11:58.951 --> 12:03.789
You swear to me
you didn't kill her?

12:06.959 --> 12:09.762
You know I didn't.

12:16.869 --> 12:19.871
(Crying) I'm sorry.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.108
Oh, it's okay.

12:23.142 --> 12:25.977
I can only imagine
what you've been going through.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.349
So... so what about
the tape then?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.551
Flora said you raped her.
(Sniffles)

12:32.585 --> 12:35.120
Were you aware that
Flora was a prostitute?

12:35.154 --> 12:39.224
Not while I was dating her.
No, obviously.

12:39.258 --> 12:45.222
She was a... gift
from Adrian Powell.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.867
And when I introduced myself,
she realized I was your father.

12:48.901 --> 12:53.572
- She refused to sleep with me.
- So what happened?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.908
Well, she was a whore.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.177
Whores can't say no.

13:04.169 --> 13:07.138
(Crow cawing,
train whistle blowing)

13:08.608 --> 13:10.308
I need to do something good.

13:10.343 --> 13:13.240
Something meaningful
with my life.

13:13.275 --> 13:14.656
But I'll never be able
to do that here.

13:14.691 --> 13:16.896
I've got to get away
from my family, you know?

13:16.931 --> 13:18.657
Did something happen?

13:18.692 --> 13:20.351
Yeah.

13:20.385 --> 13:23.387
And I wish I could tell you
about it. I really do. But...

13:23.421 --> 13:24.855
I can't.

13:26.524 --> 13:28.459
It's messed up.

13:28.493 --> 13:30.193
So what are you trying
to tell me?

13:30.228 --> 13:33.597
- Are you going away?
- Yeah.

13:36.868 --> 13:40.136
And there's something
I need to ask you.

13:45.176 --> 13:47.277
"Hope and medicine"?

13:47.311 --> 13:49.746
It's a group of doctors
who go to third world countries

13:49.780 --> 13:51.514
and set up clinics
and hospitals.

13:51.548 --> 13:53.917
But Remi's not a doctor.

13:53.951 --> 13:56.219
They need assistants,
and he's got a year of pre-med.

13:56.254 --> 13:58.922
And when would he leave?
(Pamphlet rustles)

13:58.956 --> 14:00.090
If they approve
his application,

14:00.124 --> 14:01.758
he'll leave for Africa
on Friday.

14:01.792 --> 14:06.062
I must say,
I am impressed.

14:06.097 --> 14:10.934
I didn't know Remi
was such a humanitarian.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.404
What?

14:14.438 --> 14:17.207
(Chuckles)

14:17.241 --> 14:18.909
He wants me to go with him.

14:18.943 --> 14:21.244
Ha! No.

14:21.279 --> 14:23.280
He could be gone
for a year.

14:23.314 --> 14:27.384
- I don't care.
- He said he loves me.

14:27.418 --> 14:29.052
Well, he can love you
when he gets back.

14:29.086 --> 14:31.388
He's trying to do something
important with his life,

14:31.422 --> 14:32.789
and I want to help him.

14:32.823 --> 14:34.224
And what about
the important things

14:34.258 --> 14:35.959
you're trying to do
with your life?

14:35.993 --> 14:37.427
They don't seem that important
without him. (Groans)

14:37.461 --> 14:39.996
I absolutely forbid it.

14:40.031 --> 14:41.798
I'm not asking for
permission.

14:41.832 --> 14:43.400
I'm telling you
what my decision is.

14:43.434 --> 14:46.602
So help me, Valentina!

14:46.637 --> 14:49.940
Yell all you want.
My bags are already packed.

14:56.447 --> 14:58.548
(Swallows)
Can I pay you a compliment?

14:58.582 --> 15:00.450
(Chuckles)
Why stop with just one?

15:00.484 --> 15:03.153
You are absolutely glowing.

15:03.187 --> 15:05.088
That's why I like
being in love.

15:05.122 --> 15:06.556
It's so good for my skin.

15:06.590 --> 15:08.425
I am thrilled
that you and Phillipe

15:08.459 --> 15:09.960
are getting back together.

15:09.994 --> 15:12.395
Is he your favorite
of all my husbands?

15:12.430 --> 15:14.464
Well, he's definitely
in the top three.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.466
Good. (Chuckles)
(Chuckles)

15:16.500 --> 15:18.234
Because I need a favor.

15:18.269 --> 15:22.105
Is there any way we could have
our engagement party here?

15:22.139 --> 15:24.374
Here?

15:24.408 --> 15:25.875
I know it's a lot to ask,

15:25.909 --> 15:29.045
but Zoila doesn't approve
of this marriage.

15:29.080 --> 15:33.916
There's also been some tension
between Phillipe and Remi.

15:33.951 --> 15:35.285
Having the party here

15:35.319 --> 15:37.454
would make life less stressful
for everyone.

15:37.488 --> 15:40.323
- Almost everyone.
- No.

15:40.358 --> 15:42.125
You would not
have to do a thing,

15:42.159 --> 15:43.860
and Phillipe will
foot the bill.

15:43.894 --> 15:47.364
Well,
it is a special occasion.

15:47.398 --> 15:49.599
(Chuckles)
Thank you.

15:49.633 --> 15:52.502
Ah! Thank you! Thank you!
(Chuckles)

15:54.671 --> 15:57.374
So what's it like
the second time around?

15:57.408 --> 15:58.574
What do you mean?

15:58.609 --> 16:01.077
You know, is the passion
still there?

16:01.112 --> 16:03.213
Is... is it just comfortable?

16:03.247 --> 16:04.881
Are you kidding?

16:04.915 --> 16:07.384
Phillipe can't keep
his hands off me.

16:07.418 --> 16:10.686
Really? At his age?

16:10.721 --> 16:13.956
He's like some
insatiable tiger.

16:13.991 --> 16:17.927
Ripping my clothes off.
Taking me on the floor.

16:17.961 --> 16:22.065
I don't see why
feminists complain so much.

16:22.099 --> 16:25.301
Being a sex object is fun.

16:25.336 --> 16:27.703
Well, he clearly adores you.
(Cup clinks)

16:27.738 --> 16:28.971
He does.

16:29.006 --> 16:30.573
It just goes to show,

16:30.607 --> 16:34.210
when it comes to love,
it's never too late.

16:34.245 --> 16:36.446
(Chuckles)

16:44.355 --> 16:45.555
(Knife thuds)
Hey.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.057
Is Spence back?

16:47.091 --> 16:49.592
- He just stepped into the shower.
- Good.

16:49.626 --> 16:51.428
That would give us
a chance to talk.

16:51.462 --> 16:52.628
I'm making dinner.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.531
I know you're still
mad at me.

16:54.565 --> 16:56.766
But I have a gift for you.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.636
And it is so amazing.
You'll want to hug me.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.173
What is it?

17:03.207 --> 17:05.241
(Purse thuds)

17:05.276 --> 17:08.377
That does not get you
a hug.

17:08.412 --> 17:12.482
It's not really for you.
It's for Miguel.

17:12.516 --> 17:15.117
Miguel?

17:16.487 --> 17:17.487
Oh.

17:17.521 --> 17:19.722
Thank you.

17:19.756 --> 17:23.292
I'll mail it to him
for his birthday.

17:23.327 --> 17:25.861
(Sniffs)
(Plastic bag rustles)

17:25.896 --> 17:28.263
Or you can give it to him
when he gets here.

17:30.634 --> 17:33.336
What?

17:33.370 --> 17:34.471
The studio has agreed

17:34.505 --> 17:36.239
to let me use
their private jet.

17:36.273 --> 17:38.741
I'm going to fly
to Guadalajara tomorrow.

17:38.775 --> 17:41.944
If your mother will bring
Miguel to the airport,

17:41.979 --> 17:44.380
I can bring him back here
to America.

17:44.415 --> 17:46.549
Why?

17:46.584 --> 17:51.187
- Why would you do this?
- 'Cause I am a good person.

17:51.222 --> 17:54.524
And good people
do stuff like this.

17:57.661 --> 18:02.565
(Sobbing and laughing)

18:02.600 --> 18:04.267
Yes!

18:04.301 --> 18:06.702
See, I knew there'd be a hug.
(Chuckles)

18:09.706 --> 18:12.175
(Voice breaking)
How can I ever thank you?

18:12.209 --> 18:14.810
You can start by
ironing my pink top.

18:14.845 --> 18:17.046
I want to wear it
on the plane.

18:19.216 --> 18:20.650
(Gasps) Mrs. Peri?

18:24.188 --> 18:27.457
I will be grateful to you
for the rest of my life.

18:27.491 --> 18:31.494
I'm so glad.

18:34.398 --> 18:37.267
(Breathes heavily)

18:46.143 --> 18:48.311
(Chuckles) See you then.

18:48.345 --> 18:50.613
Bye.
(Beep)

18:50.648 --> 18:53.115
Hello, awkward. (Sighs)

18:53.150 --> 18:55.385
What's wrong?
(Chuckles)

18:55.419 --> 18:57.086
Genevieve just told me

18:57.120 --> 19:00.122
the Powells are hosting
her engagement party.

19:00.157 --> 19:01.424
And we haven't seen them

19:01.458 --> 19:02.692
since the night that
Michael punched Adrian.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.395
Do you have to go?

19:05.429 --> 19:06.829
Oh, yeah.

19:06.863 --> 19:09.832
But Genevieve is inviting
half of Beverly Hills.

19:09.866 --> 19:14.204
So hopefully we will get
lost in the crowd.

19:14.238 --> 19:18.341
Why is Phillipe
so important to Michael?

19:18.375 --> 19:19.642
Oh, Phillipe...

19:19.677 --> 19:23.346
He just pays him
tons and tons of money.

19:23.380 --> 19:24.581
Oh.

19:24.615 --> 19:28.685
What does Michael do
for Phillipe?

19:28.719 --> 19:31.454
I don't know. Legal stuff.

19:31.488 --> 19:32.455
Why?

19:32.489 --> 19:35.124
No reason.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.461
Are you sure?
You seem very...

19:38.495 --> 19:39.895
Interested.

19:39.930 --> 19:44.367
Honestly, I just saw
a picture of him today...

19:44.401 --> 19:47.470
Phillipe. So I've just...
he's been on my mind.

19:47.504 --> 19:49.672
Ah. (Chuckles)

19:55.679 --> 19:58.581
(Dialing cell phone)

20:01.585 --> 20:04.721
Michael? It's me. Uh...
I don't know if this is

20:04.755 --> 20:06.256
something that
you would care about,

20:06.290 --> 20:09.492
but Marisol just asked me
a whole bunch of questions

20:09.526 --> 20:11.461
about Phillipe.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.635
(Groans)
(Wristwatch clicks)

20:18.669 --> 20:20.803
Hey, you.
Hey.

20:23.374 --> 20:24.807
Hey.
What's wrong?

20:24.841 --> 20:26.175
Nothing. Uh...
(Wristwatch continues clicking)

20:26.209 --> 20:28.511
I'm just... uh, it was
a long plane ride.

20:28.545 --> 20:30.713
Oh. Okay.

20:30.748 --> 20:32.415
Maybe we can go
for a walk later.

20:32.449 --> 20:33.750
Take the baby
in a stroller?

20:33.784 --> 20:35.652
That's very
Norman Rockwell of you.

20:35.686 --> 20:37.754
It's such a beautiful night.

20:37.788 --> 20:39.522
Why are you
in such a good mood?

20:39.556 --> 20:41.457
I'm about to do something
wonderful for Rosie.

20:41.492 --> 20:44.594
And I'm feeling...
I don't know...

20:44.628 --> 20:46.462
Proud of myself.

20:46.497 --> 20:51.200
Well, what exactly
are you about to do?

20:56.373 --> 20:59.309
Hey. I just heard
the good news.

20:59.343 --> 21:01.811
You must be so excited
to see Miguel again.

21:04.014 --> 21:06.516
Part of me can't believe
that Peri's doing this.

21:06.550 --> 21:09.919
It's like her first
official act of kindness.

21:15.359 --> 21:19.028
You must be feeling...
Guilty right now.

21:19.062 --> 21:22.665
But this doesn't have
to change anything between us.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.233
(Lowered voice)
We can still get married.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.938
I am begging you.

21:28.972 --> 21:32.809
Don't let this
one act of kindness

21:32.843 --> 21:35.478
keep us from being happy.

21:35.512 --> 21:38.781
Peri will forgive us in time.

21:40.957 --> 21:43.586
Tell me we're still good.

21:46.089 --> 21:47.757
(Clatters)

22:06.279 --> 22:08.213
(Sighs)
Darling...

22:08.248 --> 22:10.816
What is our net worth?

22:10.851 --> 22:13.052
Well, if you count the jet

22:13.086 --> 22:15.788
and the stocks and the art
and the summer home,

22:15.822 --> 22:19.859
uh, about $100 million,
I should think. Why?

22:19.893 --> 22:21.326
I need to know what
I can expect

22:21.361 --> 22:24.063
in the way of a settlement.

22:24.097 --> 22:27.299
- What?
- I'm divorcing you.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.368
So I'm entitled
to $50 million,

22:29.402 --> 22:31.470
but I don't want
to seem bitter.

22:31.504 --> 22:34.261
Maybe I will settle for 40
as a gesture of goodwill.

22:34.508 --> 22:36.576
I don't understand.

22:36.610 --> 22:38.077
It has recently
occurred to me

22:38.111 --> 22:40.946
that I don't have to be
unhappy.

22:40.981 --> 22:43.816
There is someone out there
who will cherish me

22:43.850 --> 22:46.586
and make love to me
with wild passionate abandon.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.488
And I'm going to find
this wonderful stranger

22:48.522 --> 22:50.790
before my breasts
get any lower.

22:50.824 --> 22:53.959
But what about me?

22:53.994 --> 22:57.563
I suppose you'll be alone.

22:57.598 --> 22:59.632
Oh.

22:59.667 --> 23:01.734
I know it will be painful.

23:01.769 --> 23:04.704
And I'm sorry,
but I need to be loved.

23:04.738 --> 23:06.673
I love you.

23:06.707 --> 23:08.708
I just don't want
to touch you.

23:12.979 --> 23:16.148
Hmm, my darling.

23:16.183 --> 23:20.886
That sentence
just cost you $50 million.

23:25.659 --> 23:27.827
(Knock on door)

23:32.633 --> 23:33.599
Hey.

23:33.634 --> 23:35.735
Hi.

23:38.104 --> 23:39.439
(Kisses)

23:39.473 --> 23:41.006
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)

23:41.041 --> 23:42.742
Are you wearing Armani?

23:42.776 --> 23:44.777
I am.

23:44.812 --> 23:46.045
You look good.

23:46.079 --> 23:49.582
No. You look good.

23:49.616 --> 23:51.417
I look sexy as hell.

23:56.724 --> 23:58.558
So...

23:58.592 --> 24:00.660
What have you been up to?
(Refrigerator door closes)

24:00.694 --> 24:01.927
Nothing much.

24:01.962 --> 24:04.930
Just... rocking
the entertainment industry.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.932
That's all.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.835
And how are you doing that?

24:08.869 --> 24:11.537
Since we last spoke,
I have been accepted into

24:11.572 --> 24:14.173
the starwonder agent
training program.

24:14.207 --> 24:16.075
You're gonna be an agent?

24:16.109 --> 24:17.643
You sound surprised.

24:17.678 --> 24:20.913
Well, you're not
smarmy or ruthless.

24:20.947 --> 24:23.750
That's why
there's a training program.

24:23.784 --> 24:26.085
I finish Friday.
And after that,

24:26.119 --> 24:28.821
I will be
a full-fledged agent...

24:28.856 --> 24:30.022
In the music division.

24:30.056 --> 24:32.291
<i>The music division?</i>

24:32.325 --> 24:35.094
Oh, yeah, and you'll be
the first client I sign.

24:35.128 --> 24:37.196
Go ahead.

24:37.230 --> 24:39.064
Kiss me.
I-I know you want to.

24:39.099 --> 24:40.666
Why didn't you tell me?

24:40.701 --> 24:42.001
If it didn't pan out,

24:42.035 --> 24:44.871
I didn't want to get
your hopes up. But now...

24:44.905 --> 24:46.472
Sam, I don't know
what to say.

24:47.974 --> 24:49.942
I love you, Carmen.

24:49.976 --> 24:53.045
So I'm gonna
make it happen for you.

24:53.079 --> 24:54.881
I'm gonna make you a star.

24:54.915 --> 24:57.316
That's great.

24:57.350 --> 24:59.685
But I don't really care
about that anymore.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.488
Huh?

25:02.523 --> 25:05.291
My priorities have changed.

25:05.325 --> 25:07.226
How can you switch...
Priorities?

25:07.260 --> 25:08.861
I mean,
from the day I met you,

25:08.896 --> 25:10.830
all you talked about
was being a famous singer.

25:10.864 --> 25:13.365
That's true, and I appreciate
your support. I do...

25:13.400 --> 25:15.701
(stammers) I-I-I don't want
to be a music agent.

25:15.736 --> 25:17.002
I hate agents. And...

25:17.037 --> 25:17.904
And I'm not that crazy
about music. I mean...

25:17.938 --> 25:19.705
Listen to me.

25:19.740 --> 25:22.508
It's not that I don't want
to have a career. It's just...

25:22.543 --> 25:24.510
I want something else more.

25:24.545 --> 25:25.878
Please don't tell me
you want to be an actress

25:25.913 --> 25:28.815
- 'cause I will be so depressed.
- No.

25:28.849 --> 25:31.818
(Sighs)

25:31.852 --> 25:33.619
I just want you.

25:33.654 --> 25:35.588
What?

25:35.622 --> 25:36.923
Come here.

25:36.957 --> 25:41.494
Fame and success
would be nice.

25:41.528 --> 25:44.897
But you are
what I need to be happy.

25:44.932 --> 25:46.566
I am so sorry that
it took me this long

25:46.600 --> 25:48.167
to figure that out.

25:52.973 --> 25:55.174
Mm... (Gasps)

25:55.208 --> 25:57.810
Would you like
to live together?

25:59.980 --> 26:01.981
(Michael)
Her name is Marisol.

26:02.015 --> 26:03.816
She came to work for us
12 weeks ago.

26:03.851 --> 26:06.619
And you say she's been
asking questions?

26:06.653 --> 26:09.989
Lots of them. And yesterday she
started asking about you.

26:10.023 --> 26:12.625
Is she a reporter?

26:12.659 --> 26:15.260
It's possible. I think
we should talk to her.

26:15.295 --> 26:17.997
Offer her a large
cash settlement to go away.

26:18.031 --> 26:22.535
- Would she go away?
- I don't know.

26:22.569 --> 26:26.005
I have a few private detectives
on retainer.

26:26.039 --> 26:27.874
Talk to them.

26:27.908 --> 26:30.576
Before I sign any checks,
I want to know

26:30.611 --> 26:33.112
exactly who this woman is
and what she wants.

26:33.146 --> 26:35.047
I'll take care of it.

26:35.081 --> 26:37.049
And leave the photo.

26:37.083 --> 26:41.086
I find it helpful to know
what my enemies look like.

26:48.228 --> 26:52.732
Smuggling people across
the border is illegal.

26:52.766 --> 26:54.634
It's not like I'm stuffing
a drug cartel into my trunk.

26:54.668 --> 26:56.969
I'm bringing one kid
by private plane.

26:57.004 --> 26:59.005
But there'll be customs agents
there when you land.

26:59.039 --> 27:01.106
What are they gonna think
when they see you with Miguel?

27:01.141 --> 27:03.809
Beautiful white actress,
small brown child.

27:03.844 --> 27:06.245
I'm guessing
they'll think adoption.

27:06.279 --> 27:08.113
You're risking
your career here.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.215
I hope you know that.

27:10.250 --> 27:11.651
So what are you suggesting?

27:11.685 --> 27:13.118
Let me do some research.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.121
I'll bet there's a legal way
to get Miguel in the country.

27:16.156 --> 27:17.389
But that could take months.

27:17.424 --> 27:19.425
And I start shooting a movie
in two weeks.

27:19.459 --> 27:21.126
Well, then I'll handle
everything.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.361
I'll talk to some top lawyers

27:22.395 --> 27:24.196
and some immigration
specialists and...

27:24.230 --> 27:26.265
Once everything's sorted,
I'll drive down to Guadalajara

27:26.299 --> 27:28.267
and pick up Miguel.

27:28.301 --> 27:31.203
<i>And then you get
all the glory?</i>

27:31.237 --> 27:34.941
This is not about
who gets credit.

27:34.975 --> 27:36.642
Rosie will love me
for doing this,

27:36.677 --> 27:38.578
and I need her to be
on my side.

27:38.612 --> 27:41.113
But she knows that
we can't break the law.

27:41.147 --> 27:44.951
Look, I'll talk to her,
and once I get Miguel back...

27:44.985 --> 27:47.453
No! No! No!
This is my idea.

27:47.487 --> 27:49.288
I get to rescue
the little Mexican boy,

27:49.322 --> 27:52.257
not you.

28:07.040 --> 28:11.210
- Mr. Delatour?
- How are you doing, Al?

28:11.244 --> 28:13.112
Keeping your nose clean?

28:13.146 --> 28:15.081
Trying to.

28:15.115 --> 28:16.816
But it's hard.

28:16.850 --> 28:18.117
Got a lot of bills to pay.

28:18.151 --> 28:20.319
Well, maybe I can
help you with that.

28:20.353 --> 28:22.822
- I need a favor.
- I figured.

28:22.856 --> 28:24.724
I'm willing to pay
a lot of money.

28:24.758 --> 28:27.093
Sounds good so far.

28:27.127 --> 28:31.196
This woman...

28:31.231 --> 28:35.262
To be frank,
she's trying to hurt me.

28:36.103 --> 28:38.337
And I won't allow that.

28:38.371 --> 28:41.707
Will I need a gun?

28:43.810 --> 28:46.345
I'm afraid so.

28:50.739 --> 28:52.302
(Carmen speaks indistinctly)
(Kisses)

28:52.337 --> 28:53.822
(Sam laughs)

28:54.710 --> 28:56.795
What do we have here?

28:57.547 --> 28:58.613
Alejandro.

28:58.647 --> 29:00.548
We didn't think you'd be
up this early.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.983
Yeah, I got that.

29:03.018 --> 29:04.586
Are the two of you
back together?

29:04.620 --> 29:06.921
(Sighs) You think I let
men in boxer shorts

29:06.955 --> 29:08.723
just wander through
the house?

29:08.757 --> 29:11.526
I wouldn't mind if you did.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.795
He's gay now.
Just go with it.

29:14.830 --> 29:16.063
Well, this is good, Sam.

29:16.098 --> 29:17.398
Now that the two of you
are dating...

29:17.433 --> 29:18.601
(Liquid pouring)
I'll get to see more of you.

29:18.636 --> 29:19.910
Actually, uh...

29:19.945 --> 29:21.001
(Sighs)
We're not just dating.

29:21.036 --> 29:22.537
(Chuckles) Yeah, Sam asked me
if I wanted to live with him

29:22.571 --> 29:24.772
- and I said yes.
- Is that okay?

29:24.806 --> 29:26.874
Of course.

29:26.908 --> 29:28.811
Are you sure?
Because I know you want a live-in.

29:28.930 --> 29:31.045
No. Odessa's gonna be
back here soon.

29:31.079 --> 29:33.748
And it makes me happy to know
the two of you are a couple.

29:33.782 --> 29:36.451
Oh. Thank you so much.
(Chuckles)

29:36.485 --> 29:37.852
We should celebrate.

29:37.886 --> 29:39.520
Go to the wine cellar
and get some champagne.

29:39.555 --> 29:41.389
(Both laugh)

29:42.791 --> 29:45.460
Yeah.

29:45.494 --> 29:47.027
Congratulations, Sam.

29:47.062 --> 29:48.563
She's a wonderful girl.

29:48.597 --> 29:50.765
Yeah, don't I know it, man.
(Spoon clinks)

29:50.799 --> 29:53.434
(Chuckles) Come on.

29:53.469 --> 29:57.505
(Camera shutter clicking)

30:00.075 --> 30:02.977
(Camera shutter
continues clicking)

30:03.011 --> 30:05.346
No, no, no.
No! No! No!

30:05.381 --> 30:07.749
Separate! Separate!

30:07.783 --> 30:09.417
(Mouths words)

30:25.033 --> 30:27.033
(Grunts)

30:31.540 --> 30:34.676
(Fence rattles)

30:34.710 --> 30:36.844
(Panting) Just so you know...

30:36.878 --> 30:38.279
We're gonna sue your ass!

30:38.314 --> 30:41.349
Everybody does.
(Camera shutter clicks)

30:41.383 --> 30:43.951
Gotcha!
(Chain clinks)

30:43.985 --> 30:46.053
(Sighs)

30:46.087 --> 30:50.725
- We're in trouble.
- Are we?

30:50.759 --> 30:52.159
Marisol's real name
is Suarez.

30:52.194 --> 30:54.495
She's the mother of the kid
the police arrested.

30:54.530 --> 30:56.397
Oh, my God.

30:56.432 --> 30:58.766
So there's no way
that we can buy her off.

30:58.801 --> 31:00.435
Well, obviously not.

31:00.469 --> 31:02.603
I think we need to go
to the D.A.

31:02.638 --> 31:05.707
What? We can tell them that
Flora's death was an accident.

31:05.741 --> 31:08.409
Self-defense.
I can negotiate a deal.

31:08.444 --> 31:11.912
We don't know
what Marisol knows.

31:11.947 --> 31:13.781
But if she's got enough

31:13.816 --> 31:15.350
to make the police look in
your direction, you're screwed.

31:15.384 --> 31:16.417
You need to get
out in front of this thing.

31:16.452 --> 31:17.385
Michael...

31:17.419 --> 31:20.588
Go home. Relax.

31:20.622 --> 31:21.856
Relax?

31:21.890 --> 31:24.291
We have to do something.

31:24.326 --> 31:27.428
I've already
taken care of it.

31:29.531 --> 31:30.931
M-meaning what?

31:33.469 --> 31:35.603
You don't want to know.

31:38.139 --> 31:40.174
You're not planning
something stupid, are you?

31:40.208 --> 31:43.811
Phillipe, if something
happens to this woman,

31:43.846 --> 31:45.446
people will talk.

31:45.481 --> 31:48.683
Doesn't everyone
still think she's a maid?

31:48.717 --> 31:50.685
So what?

31:50.719 --> 31:54.455
So in my experience, people just
aren't that interested

31:54.490 --> 31:57.358
in what happens to the help.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.033
(Knock on door)

32:06.067 --> 32:07.702
Hey.

32:07.736 --> 32:10.938
I heard that group of doctors
accepted your application.

32:10.972 --> 32:13.708
They did. I leave Friday.

32:13.742 --> 32:15.843
Did you...
Talk to Valentina?

32:15.878 --> 32:17.645
I did.

32:17.679 --> 32:20.715
And now I'm gonna
talk to you.

32:20.749 --> 32:22.983
Sit down.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.422
Valentina has wanted
to be a designer

32:27.456 --> 32:29.457
since she was a child.

32:29.491 --> 32:31.992
She used to make dresses
for her dolls.

32:32.027 --> 32:34.161
I could see the talent
even then.

32:34.195 --> 32:37.998
So I bought her
sewing machines

32:38.033 --> 32:40.100
and patterns and fabric.

32:40.135 --> 32:43.003
I did all I could
to encourage her.

32:43.038 --> 32:44.839
Her dream became my dream.

32:48.544 --> 32:50.311
(Sighs)

32:50.345 --> 32:51.546
You're about to tell me
you don't want her

32:51.580 --> 32:54.048
to go to Africa with me.
Oh, Remi.

32:54.082 --> 32:57.151
I have seen so many women
throw their ambition away

32:57.185 --> 32:58.986
because they're scared
of losing a man.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.430
To be honest, I'm the one who's
scared of losing her.

33:01.431 --> 33:02.431
 I know.

33:02.658 --> 33:04.826
But if you love her,

33:04.860 --> 33:08.295
you must let her
go to school.

33:08.330 --> 33:12.066
Let her be everything
she can be.

33:15.170 --> 33:17.104
So what do you want me
to do?

33:23.078 --> 33:25.880
I've written a note.

33:28.550 --> 33:30.250
You're gonna copy it...
(Voice breaking)

33:30.285 --> 33:34.689
In your handwriting
and leave it for Valentina.

33:34.723 --> 33:37.091
(Paper rustles)
It explains

33:37.125 --> 33:40.628
why you want her to stay...

33:40.662 --> 33:43.931
And why you needed to leave
without saying good-bye.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.741
If I do this,
she'll never forgive me.

33:53.775 --> 33:54.809
No.

33:56.778 --> 34:01.048
A year from now
she'll know the truth.

34:01.082 --> 34:05.486
And I'll be the one
she won't forgive.

34:11.827 --> 34:12.927
They should be here
any second.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.129
(Gasps) I know.

34:15.163 --> 34:18.533
Can I say something?

34:18.567 --> 34:20.100
I wish you wouldn't.

34:20.135 --> 34:22.603
I'm gonna divorce Peri.

34:22.638 --> 34:25.773
If that's what you want.

34:25.806 --> 34:28.175
It is.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.710
And I was thinking...

34:29.745 --> 34:30.945
Maybe in a few months

34:30.978 --> 34:32.580
after I've been on my own
for a while...

34:32.614 --> 34:35.550
Mrs. Peri is bringing
my son here.

34:36.952 --> 34:38.786
He's my life.

34:38.820 --> 34:44.025
I can't repay her kindness
with betrayal,

34:44.059 --> 34:48.161
not even for someone
I love.

34:49.764 --> 34:50.665
(Door closes)

34:50.699 --> 34:55.135
(Sniffles, exhales deeply)

34:55.170 --> 34:58.005
Hey, Rosie.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.206
Guess who's here?

34:59.240 --> 35:01.108
(Chuckles)

35:01.142 --> 35:04.679
(Chuckles)

35:04.713 --> 35:06.747
(Gasps and laughs)

35:06.782 --> 35:10.317
<i>- Mami!
- Oh.</i>

35:10.351 --> 35:12.787
(Laughing and crying)
(Peri claps)

35:12.821 --> 35:14.822
(Laughs)

35:16.625 --> 35:19.126
Thank you, Mrs. Peri.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.730
For the rest of my life,
thank you. (Sniffles)

35:22.764 --> 35:26.100
It was truly my pleasure.

35:26.134 --> 35:27.334
(Exhales deeply) Oh.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.238
(Sighs)

35:31.272 --> 35:33.741
Isn't he just precious?

35:33.775 --> 35:35.776
Yes, he is.

35:35.811 --> 35:38.378
And to think
you wanted me to wait.

35:42.283 --> 35:44.351
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

35:44.385 --> 35:46.253
- He didn't want me to get Miguel.
- That's not what I said.

35:46.287 --> 35:48.555
(Chuckles)
You're such a liar.

35:48.590 --> 35:49.724
He wanted me to wait
for a few months

35:49.758 --> 35:50.958
while he talked to lawyers

35:50.993 --> 35:52.927
and waded through
a bunch of red tape.

35:52.961 --> 35:55.963
<i>But I said, "No.
Rosie needs her little boy now."</i>

35:55.998 --> 35:57.598
I was just worried.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.900
- This is so illegal.
- Oh, who cares?!

35:59.935 --> 36:01.201
It's so worth it.

36:01.236 --> 36:02.903
Rosie, do you want
to show Miguel the house?

36:06.842 --> 36:09.710
We have a pool.
Do you know what a pool is?

36:11.412 --> 36:12.613
Rosie, I...

36:15.884 --> 36:19.219
I really am glad
he's here.

36:30.744 --> 36:32.197
(door creaks)

36:32.232 --> 36:35.229
(Breathing heavily)

36:35.264 --> 36:37.030
(Footsteps approaching)

36:37.962 --> 36:40.673
Hey, Michael.
How was work?

36:40.708 --> 36:42.509
(Bowl clatters)
You have to go.

36:42.544 --> 36:44.216
What?

36:44.251 --> 36:45.981
You need to pack your things
and leave now!

36:46.015 --> 36:48.016
Why?

36:48.050 --> 36:49.985
Because
you're not safe here!

36:51.620 --> 36:53.088
I know who you are
and why you came here,

36:53.122 --> 36:55.690
and I'm not the only one
who knows.

36:55.724 --> 36:56.757
Who else?

36:56.792 --> 37:00.028
I can't tell you.

37:00.062 --> 37:03.298
- Is it Phillipe Delatour?
- Just...

37:03.332 --> 37:06.301
Get your things
and I'll call you a taxi.

37:10.873 --> 37:13.873
(Dog barking in distance)

37:28.757 --> 37:30.625
Poor Alejandro.

37:30.659 --> 37:33.061
Poor Alejandro?
What about me?

37:33.095 --> 37:34.962
This picture could
destroy his career.

37:34.997 --> 37:37.632
- Nobody cares if you're gay.
- My mother cares!

37:37.666 --> 37:39.067
Then tell her I'm moving in.

37:39.101 --> 37:41.118
Now she'll think
you're a drag queen.

37:41.153 --> 37:42.003
Enough.

37:42.038 --> 37:44.639
I don't want to keep
talking about that picture.

37:44.673 --> 37:46.408
(Sighs)

37:46.442 --> 37:49.477
So...
How is Alejandro doing?

37:49.512 --> 37:52.880
How do you think?
He's devastated. Well...

37:52.915 --> 37:54.949
I mean, it's just
the Internet.

37:54.983 --> 37:56.518
Maybe people will stop
talking about it.

37:56.552 --> 38:00.688
Not anytime soon.
(Scoffs)

38:00.722 --> 38:03.858
(Sighs)

38:03.892 --> 38:05.860
How are we gonna contain this?

38:05.894 --> 38:07.562
He needs a beard.

38:07.596 --> 38:09.697
Showing up on the red carpet
with a busty blonde

38:09.731 --> 38:12.074
isn't gonna make people forget
this photo. (Photo rustles)

38:12.109 --> 38:13.968
I'm not talking about
a girlfriend.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.871
We need to get him married.

38:16.905 --> 38:20.442
She'd need to be discreet...
And hot.

38:20.476 --> 38:24.179
Is there anyone
you can trust to help you out?

38:28.917 --> 38:32.120
I know just the girl.

38:32.154 --> 38:35.390
(Objects clattering)

38:37.793 --> 38:39.427
What is this?

38:39.462 --> 38:40.828
I thought you were out.

38:40.862 --> 38:42.997
Being pregnant makes me tired.
I was taking a nap.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.032
Why is Marisol
packing her bags?

38:45.067 --> 38:47.102
Take your things to the taxi.
I'll tell her what's going on.

38:47.136 --> 38:49.604
I'll say good-bye when
I come back for my purse.

38:49.638 --> 38:52.207
(Door opens)
Michael, what is going on?

39:11.693 --> 39:14.762
If she is in danger,
why are we sending her away?

39:14.796 --> 39:16.231
People know
that she's here.

39:16.265 --> 39:17.965
And these are people
you work with?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.467
I can't talk about that.

39:19.502 --> 39:20.935
Well, whoever this woman is,
she is our friend,

39:20.969 --> 39:22.203
and we have to protect her.
(Door closes)

39:22.238 --> 39:25.840
That's what
I'm trying to do!

39:25.874 --> 39:28.042
I'm ready to go.

39:28.076 --> 39:30.745
Marisol, oh, my God.

39:30.779 --> 39:32.713
Did Michael tell you
everything?

39:32.748 --> 39:34.749
He did.

39:34.783 --> 39:37.185
I am...

39:37.219 --> 39:39.887
So sorry that
I had to lie to you.

39:39.921 --> 39:42.557
Did you lie
about being my friend?

39:42.591 --> 39:44.091
Never.

39:44.126 --> 39:46.294
(Clicks tongue)

39:49.097 --> 39:50.532
(Whispers) Please don't go.

39:50.566 --> 39:53.000
Believe me.

39:53.035 --> 39:54.702
I don't want to.

39:54.736 --> 39:56.204
Then you'll stay.

39:56.238 --> 39:58.206
- Taylor!
- Just call the police.

39:58.240 --> 40:00.608
I can't. They'll ask questions
I can't answer.

40:00.643 --> 40:01.876
Then call a security company.

40:01.910 --> 40:03.944
They'll send over bodyguards.
Michael...

40:03.979 --> 40:05.980
Even if I leave,

40:06.014 --> 40:08.849
I'm still going to find out
who killed Flora Hernandez.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.618
It's settled.

40:10.653 --> 40:13.087
You're staying.
I'll grab your bags.

40:15.090 --> 40:18.660
(Door opens in distance)

40:34.142 --> 40:35.610
(Door creaks)

40:35.644 --> 40:38.045
Taylor?

40:38.080 --> 40:39.247
Oh, my God.

40:39.281 --> 40:40.781
Oh, my God!

40:40.816 --> 40:41.982
Taylor, talk to me.
Taylor!

40:42.017 --> 40:44.852
(Panting)

40:44.886 --> 40:45.886
Call 9-1-1.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.055
Now!

40:48.090 --> 40:49.824
Taylor, talk to me.
Taylor.

40:49.858 --> 40:52.960
Hang in there, baby.
They're coming.

40:52.994 --> 40:54.962
Hurry up! Please!

40:56.532 --> 41:00.167
Hang in there, baby.
Stay with me.
