WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.760
I've had another complaint. And it's
a GMC one. It's going to tribunal.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.200
Why would Erika complain again?
She hasn't. It's anonymous.

00:07.200 --> 00:10.080
You think that you are
the cleverest person in the room,

00:10.080 --> 00:12.600
and that makes you dangerous.
You're a liability!

00:12.600 --> 00:14.800
I mean, I guess you are the one
who sent her home early

00:14.800 --> 00:17.160
and then falsified the notes.
All right, Judge Judy!

00:17.160 --> 00:19.760
If you ever want to chat about
Harry, you know I'm here for you.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.440
I think I'm actually designed
to be on my own.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.720
I'm sorry. I really did try.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.000
SOBS:  I don't know
what she was thinking.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.880
LOUD GROANING

00:38.880 --> 00:42.400
Sorry you've ended up with a twin
room. No room at the inn today.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.840
Better than a bunk bed, I guess.

00:43.840 --> 00:46.040
Yeah - get four to a room that way!

00:46.040 --> 00:48.000
GROANING, DEVICE BEEPS AND VIBRATES

00:49.520 --> 00:51.960
Sorry! Sorry about the room.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.600
SCREAMING CONTINUES

00:53.600 --> 00:54.760
Sorry.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.840
BABY CRIES

01:00.840 --> 01:02.760
BEEPING AND VIBRATING

01:02.760 --> 01:05.680
Hey, baby! HE LAUGHS

01:05.680 --> 01:08.480
I'm so sorry about all this.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.120
He got wasted at the office party.
I'm going to strangle him later.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.120
Make sure you do a thorough job -
because they're really busy in A&E.

01:15.120 --> 01:18.520
That's a nice big contraction now.
One last big push for me.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.800
You're doing really well.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.920
SHE GROANS

01:21.920 --> 01:23.680
Stop pushing. Pant.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.560
SHE PANTS, MAN LAUGHS

01:27.000 --> 01:28.400
BABY CRIES

01:28.400 --> 01:30.760
Yay! Wahey!

01:32.960 --> 01:34.160
Love you!

01:35.240 --> 01:36.720
Love you.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.920
LIQUID SPLASHES

01:52.920 --> 01:54.320
Sir!

01:54.320 --> 01:56.080
Sir! Stop that.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.160
This is not a toilet,
you absolute...

01:58.160 --> 02:00.400
SHE SHOUTS

02:06.240 --> 02:08.720
Why don't you pop downstairs
and go for a walk for half an hour?

02:08.720 --> 02:11.280
What, you can't squeeze us in
before then?

02:11.280 --> 02:13.200
I'm not running
a Pizza Express, sir.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.040
Who bleeped me?
Tracy needs an FBS done, love.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.960
Do me an FBS.

02:17.960 --> 02:21.960
What does FBS mean?
Foetal blood sample.  Oh.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.320
Which room?  Five. Erm...

02:24.320 --> 02:26.640
Are you going to go to
Shruti's thing later?

02:26.640 --> 02:29.280
Well, I was planning to, but I'm not
sure I can leave all this with a

02:29.280 --> 02:31.200
PE teacher in scrubs.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.400
Er, Adam, can I ask you a question
about a patient I've just seen?

02:34.400 --> 02:39.040
Quick, then.  So...she's
32 and a half years old,

02:39.040 --> 02:41.720
she's 37 weeks pregnant,
generally fit and well.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.360
She has asthma, so sometimes...

02:43.360 --> 02:45.880
Quick's the one
when you get to the fucking point.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.440
Right. She's got a urine infection,
so...  Yeah, erm...

02:51.760 --> 02:54.320
So, should I give her
some antibiotics?

02:54.320 --> 02:57.560
As opposed to what, a healing
crystal and some magic runes?

02:58.760 --> 03:00.360
Absolute waste of organs.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.400
And the award for Boss of the Year
goes to...!

03:05.640 --> 03:08.080
MOBILE VIBRATES

03:13.680 --> 03:15.400
Angle the lamp a bit better for me.

03:17.920 --> 03:18.960
Please?

03:20.960 --> 03:22.000
Please.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.560
Remember to file another complaint
about my manners.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.360
I've had weeks of this now, Adam.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.320
Can you stop being quite so much
of a twat.  Tracy!

03:32.320 --> 03:35.200
No, don't "Tracy" me!
Anyway, the patient's deaf.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.360
And if she wasn't sure,
I'm sure she'd agree

03:37.360 --> 03:39.680
that was a pretty twat-ish thing
to say.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.200
I know old habits
are hard to change,

03:41.200 --> 03:43.120
but want to try being professional?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.720
What, like you?

03:44.720 --> 03:46.720
Well, that's assuming
I still have a profession

03:46.720 --> 03:48.400
after my hearing tomorrow.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.680
SHE SIGHS

03:51.680 --> 03:54.560
And just so you know, I'm nipping
out to Shruti's memorial

03:54.560 --> 03:57.400
for five minutes, if I can.  What,
so you've got time for her

03:57.400 --> 03:58.840
now she's dead, do you?

04:01.320 --> 04:03.200
I'm...sorry. I didn't mean that.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.960
Absolutely sure that it's me
that's the twat?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.360
You do know I can lip-read, right?

04:14.880 --> 04:15.920
Hey.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.320
You coming to the memorial?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.600
Yeah.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.880
BEEPING AND VIBRATING

04:27.760 --> 04:29.560
Have fun.  Hey, give me that.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.520
She'd have wanted you there.

04:34.560 --> 04:37.200
You sure?  Of course.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.080
MOBILE VIBRATES

04:43.080 --> 04:44.440
You've got 30 seconds.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.600
Right. So Emma's been getting
this weird pain in her groin.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.160
It only happens if she stands
on one leg, but it's agony.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.360
What do you reckon?
Stand on two legs.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.160
I mean, if she's putting
her trousers on.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.240
It's probably just
symphysis pubis dysfunction.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.000
It's nothing to worry about.
See a physio.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.680
They can give her this special belt
thing.  You're a legend, and...

05:00.680 --> 05:01.720
Time's up! Bye.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.120
CHATTER

05:09.120 --> 05:10.920
WOMAN CLEARS THROAT

05:10.920 --> 05:14.160
Thanks so much to so many of you
for coming.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.400
Christ knows who's looking
after the labour ward.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.040
Better not be me! MOBILE RINGS

05:18.040 --> 05:21.400
We're obviously here to remember
Shruti Akarya

05:21.400 --> 05:24.080
and to unveil this lovely...

05:25.240 --> 05:28.240
..I'm going to say oak tree
in her honour.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.200
So let me hand over, first of all,
to Mr and Mrs Akarya.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.200
Acharya.  Acharya.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.680
Thank you, all, for coming.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.280
You know, Shruti loved
being a doctor.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.720
But every time she called us,
she would tell us how much

05:48.720 --> 05:51.120
she enjoyed working with you all.

05:53.040 --> 05:59.280
Shruti...brought us huge pride
in everything she achieved.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.760
And it brings us great joy
that she will live on,

06:03.760 --> 06:07.400
not just in our hearts
and our minds,

06:07.400 --> 06:12.840
but in this beautiful tree which
will live longer than anyone here.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.720
APPLAUSE

06:19.480 --> 06:22.120
As Shruti's educational supervisor,

06:22.120 --> 06:26.800
I know first-hand what a committed
and dedicated doctor she was,

06:26.800 --> 06:31.360
as evidenced by her passing
her Part One exam first-time -

06:31.360 --> 06:33.960
something, I might add,
I did not do.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.360
Seven driving tests, too,
and counting.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.800
Can do a caesarean in five minutes
with one hand,

06:38.800 --> 06:40.640
can't reverse around
a bloody corner!

06:40.640 --> 06:42.720
SUBDUED LAUGHTER

06:42.720 --> 06:45.160
We're all the poorer for her loss.

06:46.560 --> 06:51.560
But depression is cruel,
and in Shruti's case, silent.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.240
While she was...

06:56.360 --> 06:58.120
..clearly doing well at work,

06:58.120 --> 07:01.000
obviously, there were other forces
at play.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.360
In life, like on labour ward,
you never really know

07:04.360 --> 07:06.120
what's around the corner.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.000
SHE GROANS

07:11.320 --> 07:13.200
Miss Houghton?  All right?

07:13.200 --> 07:16.520
I think maybe Shruti wasn't quite
as happy at work as you said.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.880
SARCASTICALLY:  No? Do you reckon?

07:19.880 --> 07:23.360
Well, what did you want her parents
to hear, that she couldn't hack it?

07:24.880 --> 07:27.960
I mean, like, shouldn't there be
some kind of investigation?

07:27.960 --> 07:31.160
Or are we all just going to
keep pretending

07:31.160 --> 07:33.600
there's nothing wrong
with this place?

07:33.600 --> 07:36.760
Sorry, I must be dementing. When
did I say there was nothing wrong?

07:36.760 --> 07:40.560
This hospital's got about three
doctors and a budget of Â£12.50.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.080
So, if you want to change it,
become a government minister,

07:43.080 --> 07:45.920
because there is bollocks-all
any of us here can do.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.760
Well, I...

07:50.120 --> 07:51.560
So what do we do now, then?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.840
Well, we all toddle off back
to work, don't we?

07:55.480 --> 07:59.240
And eventually they forget to water
the tree and that dies as well.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.200
MOBILE VIBRATES

08:18.800 --> 08:20.600
I'm so sorry for your loss.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.000
Er... Did you work closely
with Shruti?

08:27.320 --> 08:28.400
I...

08:30.400 --> 08:32.480
No, not really, no. Erm...

08:36.000 --> 08:37.640
But she's much missed.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.640
Walk with me, Kay.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.600
So...tomorrow's your big day
at GMC towers?

08:55.800 --> 08:57.640
Yes, yeah. It is, yeah.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.280
I must say, I'm very sorry
you're going through all this.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.320
For what it's worth,
I think it's bloody unfair

09:02.320 --> 09:04.920
that it has to end like this.
I'm not sure it's going to end.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.600
Well, you falsified the notes.
Seemed pretty cut-and-dry to me.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.000
I'm not sure anyone really
comes back from that.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.960
No, I wrote what you told me
to write,

09:13.960 --> 09:15.440
and then you weaselled back on it.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.240
Well, my lawyer thinks
I stand a fighting chance.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.160
How are you intending to play things
at the tribunal?

09:23.640 --> 09:27.480
Well, hopefully I'll persuade them
that a simple lapse

09:27.480 --> 09:30.520
in my professional judgment
shouldn't need to bring

09:30.520 --> 09:32.480
my future into question.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.440
You're a bloody good doctor, Adam.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.880
We need more doctors like you.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.360
You owe it to yourself, to your
patients, to stay in the game.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.320
If I was in your position, I think
I'd try and realign the narrative

09:46.320 --> 09:48.440
ever so slightly.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.880
I'm not sure that I follow.

09:50.880 --> 09:56.040
Well, you just tell our friends
at the GMC that your colleague,

09:56.040 --> 10:00.160
Dr Acharya, mistakenly told you
that I said it was OK

10:00.160 --> 10:04.560
to send the patient home when,
in fact, she hadn't spoken to me.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.040
She and she alone knocked over
the first domino.

10:11.880 --> 10:15.080
But she... But she didn't do that.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.120
Who's to know?

10:19.280 --> 10:21.480
You're suggesting
that I throw her...

10:21.480 --> 10:23.360
..I throw Shruti under the bus?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.160
No-one loses this way.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.520
It's time for pragmatism, Adam,
not emotions -

10:28.520 --> 10:31.240
if you want to keep your job,
that is.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.560

10:37.960 --> 10:40.160
PIANO PLAYS SOFTLY

10:46.880 --> 10:48.960
I've got a crowbar!

10:48.960 --> 10:50.280
Just me, Mum.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.120
I know it's just you.
I've come to smash up the piano.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.920
Schubert.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.120
You'd never know
just from listening.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.200
You all set for tomorrow?

11:05.200 --> 11:09.960
Yeah, I guess.  It's just a hiccup.
It's a vexatious bit of bureaucracy.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.160
You are going to shave, right?
Mm-hm.

11:13.160 --> 11:15.320
Make sure you give
a good showing, Adam,

11:15.320 --> 11:18.960
because we've all worked so hard
to get you here.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.440
Oh, "we", is it?

11:20.440 --> 11:23.240
Remind me how many
labour ward shifts you've done.

11:23.240 --> 11:25.160
Oh, just the one visit
to a labour ward,

11:25.160 --> 11:28.080
and then an entire lifetime given up
to getting you here.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.840
Not sure I remember
ever asking you to.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.440
Quite how you ended up so rude,
I'll never know.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.320
A mystery for the ages.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.040
TANNOY:  We are now approaching
Manchester Piccadilly,

11:58.040 --> 11:59.960
where this service terminates.

12:00.960 --> 12:03.400
Yeah, so I just say yes or no
to their questions.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.000
And anything that needs a longer
answer than that, I'll take it.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.760
Am I going to be all right?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.200
Yeah, totally.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.960
Oh, sorry, hang on. What did he say?

12:19.960 --> 12:22.680
Am I going to be all right?
Oh, Christ knows.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.360
But... But you know my motto -

12:26.360 --> 12:28.160
never say never.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.320
I'm going to go to the bathroom.  OK.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.400
You've got five minutes, Alan.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.320
DOOR BANGS

12:45.200 --> 12:47.040
DOOR OPENS

12:50.600 --> 12:51.920
Just do it.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.040
You treated me like shit
when I was alive.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.640
What does one more time matter?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.120
You weren't doing coke in there?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.480
No.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.400
Adam Kay?

13:29.520 --> 13:32.520
Right, after you. Good luck.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.400
Hope you saved some for us
afterwards.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.880
Great. I'm going to get struck off
in a room that looks like

13:50.880 --> 13:52.880
it's used
for a speed-awareness course.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.560
Good afternoon.
My name is Tina Sharpehouse,

13:59.560 --> 14:01.440
and I'm the tribunal chair.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.480
This is a fitness to practise
hearing for Adam Richard Kay.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.840
Would you please stand up, Dr Kay?

14:09.880 --> 14:12.680
Still calling me "doctor" -
that's a good start.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.880
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

14:14.880 --> 14:16.560
and nothing but the truth?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.160
I do.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.520
Please be seated.

14:27.760 --> 14:34.600
On April 16th, at 4.15pm, you
reviewed patient Erika Van Hegan,

14:34.600 --> 14:38.240
25 weeks pregnant
and presenting with a headache.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.280
You discharged her home.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.840
You wrote in the notes
that you had discussed this decision

14:43.840 --> 14:46.680
with your consultant,
Mr Nigel Lockhart,

14:46.680 --> 14:48.360
a fact that he denies.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.560
I'd like to say a few words.
WHISPERS:  No, you wouldn't!

14:50.560 --> 14:53.240
There's time for you to say anything
you need to later on.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.440
You may sit back down.
On the day in question,

14:55.440 --> 14:58.600
I was working alongside
an SHO colleague...

15:02.240 --> 15:04.040
..called Shruti Acharya.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.440
HE CHUCKLES I did not see that coming.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.920
I mean, if you'd asked me before,
I'd have said you were toast,

15:14.920 --> 15:18.280
but then - bam, out of nowhere -
you come out with that.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.040
I literally can't believe we won.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.240
I can't tell you how much
I needed this, by the way.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.760
My numbers have NOT been good
this year.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.480
PHONE VIBRATES

16:12.080 --> 16:13.600
Good to see you.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.320
You too.
Do you want...something?

16:16.320 --> 16:17.800
No, thanks.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.480
How are you?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.040
Yeah, not bad.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.680
That's good.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.600
The couple downstairs
have a new baby,

16:26.600 --> 16:30.960
which screams, like, 20 hours a day,
so your timing was pretty good.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.920
HE LAUGHS

16:34.440 --> 16:35.920
You're looking well.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.720
Does that mean fat?

16:37.720 --> 16:40.480
BOTH LAUGH It's her cooking. It's...

16:40.480 --> 16:42.960
You know, the main ingredient
is butter.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.960
How is it?

16:46.960 --> 16:49.640
Attached back to Mummy's
apron strings?

16:49.640 --> 16:51.240
They're slightly strangling.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.120
But, you know,

16:54.120 --> 16:56.960
when did a bit of light
strangulation ever hurt anyone?

17:03.440 --> 17:06.400
So, I had a good chat
with the estate agents.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.760
They said there's actually
a six-month break clause,

17:08.760 --> 17:10.360
so I can move out in September.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.280
I printed off the form.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.080
You just need to sign at the bottom.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.400
How's work?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.600
HE CRIES

17:29.160 --> 17:30.480
Shit.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.520
Shruti?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.080
It's so horrible.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.920
I just keep playing over in my mind
everything I said to her.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.520
Everything I should have said.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.680
Everything I shouldn't. I just...

18:00.680 --> 18:02.840
..I don't understand how it...

18:04.720 --> 18:06.200
Anyway.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.320
I let her down so terribly.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.000
Don't beat yourself up.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.520
I'm sure you were a great boss.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.440
I was a crap boss.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.840
Crap boyfriend. Crap doctor.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.080
Hey, come on.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.040
So, what,
I was an amazing boyfriend?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.240
What are you doing Saturday?

18:37.240 --> 18:38.520
A 10K.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.840
That sounds awful.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.120
Well, there's still a place
at Greg's wedding if you fancy it.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.880
And that's meant to be an upgrade?

18:50.880 --> 18:54.400
Emma's designed the table
decorations. They're terrible.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.080
Like 4ft foot glass dildos.  Christ.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.040
Anyway,

19:01.040 --> 19:04.520
would you consider being
my temporary plus-one?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.120
Oh, I don't know. I don't...
I'm not sure.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.280
Special...

19:10.600 --> 19:13.200
..one-night-only cameo appearance?

19:19.600 --> 19:22.200
PHONE VIBRATES

19:22.200 --> 19:24.320
Hi, Greg.
Quick one - sure it's nothing.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.760
Then, maybe don't phone me about it.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.880
Emma just called to say
the baby's not been kicking.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.520
You know, it's normally a right
little Ronaldo, but this morning

19:30.520 --> 19:33.760
it's more of a Ronny Rosenthal.
More homosexual references, please.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.120
Footwork of Bob Fosse,
that kind of thing.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.040
When did she last feel any movement?
About 90 minutes ago.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.520
Tell her to drink a pint
of ice-cold water.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.840
Should get it moving.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.440
Bit like chucking a pint of cold
water over Jakesy to wake him up.

19:45.440 --> 19:46.720
Exactly.

19:46.720 --> 19:52.080
Isn't one of the school lot
a recruitment consultant now?

19:52.080 --> 19:54.160
Yeah, Welly.  Oh, shit.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.720
Is anyone else?  He's amazing at it,
amazingly.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.560
He's a bit like the Incredible Hulk,
only it's tequila that sets him off.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.160
Is this about the...?

20:02.160 --> 20:04.320
Oh, Christ, did you get struck off?

20:04.320 --> 20:06.800
No, no. I did what I had to.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.040
Meaning?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.520
Just wonder if a change of scenery
might be good for me.

20:10.520 --> 20:11.920
DISTANT SIREN WAILS

20:18.520 --> 20:20.200
OK, look at you!

20:23.200 --> 20:25.280
Look who's here.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.640
My God, Dr Adam!

20:26.640 --> 20:28.200
Oh, my God.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.280
I'm so glad you made it.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.360
Can you believe Misty's going home?

20:32.360 --> 20:33.680
You've got to say hello.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.640
Look who came to see you.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.840
BABY GURGLES Dr Adam.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.560
I'm just very pleased
that everything's

20:41.560 --> 20:43.240
turned out well in the end.

20:43.240 --> 20:45.160
Well, I actually got you something.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.040
Just to say thank you.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.640
I mean, he wouldn't be here
without you.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.040
Wow.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.520
"World's best doctor."

21:02.520 --> 21:04.880
I don't know about that, but...
You are.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.640
Oh, joint best.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.720
I got one for the lovely Asian
lady doctor, too,

21:10.720 --> 21:12.680
so would you mind passing it on?

21:12.680 --> 21:14.240
Actually, she...

21:17.480 --> 21:18.880
No problem.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.240
Do you want to hold him?  Sure.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.080
Yeah?

21:23.080 --> 21:24.880
Yeah!

21:24.880 --> 21:26.560
Cuddles.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.320
Ah, yes!

21:32.240 --> 21:33.760
Look.

21:36.840 --> 21:40.440
You're going to be a surgeon
like Dr Adam when you grow up.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.560
If that's what he really wants
to do.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.280
Whatever he does, I'm sure
he'll make you very proud.

21:47.280 --> 21:51.800
Well, I guess being a doctor
isn't everyone's cup of teeth.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.160
BEEPING Oh, sorry.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.800
WOMAN:  Labour ward, room one,
shoulder dystocia.  I have to...

21:55.800 --> 21:58.320
That's labour ward, room one,
shoulder dystocia.  Dr Adam...

21:58.320 --> 22:00.160
..Dr Adam, you forgot your present.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.800
Shoulder dystocia are two words
you never want to hear

22:02.800 --> 22:04.200
as an obstetrician.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.680
Baby's head delivers,
but its shoulders get stuck.

22:06.680 --> 22:07.920
All the time this is going on,

22:07.920 --> 22:10.080
baby's brain isn't getting
any oxygen.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.000
Five minutes of that,
and it's irreversible damage.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.040
ALARM BLARES

22:15.040 --> 22:17.000
MOTHER PANTS 3 minutes 20.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.040
My name is Adam.
I'm one of the doctors.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.160
I'm sure your midwife has explained

22:21.160 --> 22:23.920
the baby's head has come out,
but the body is stuck.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.600
I want you to listen to what I ask
you to do, and we'll get baby out.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.800
Get those knees up higher. MOTHER GROANS

22:29.800 --> 22:31.240
Higher, proper McRoberts.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.040
Come on, you need to get him out!

22:33.040 --> 22:34.840
SHE SOBS

22:34.840 --> 22:37.080
3 minutes 40.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.520
SHE SOBS

22:38.520 --> 22:40.080
What have you tried?

22:40.080 --> 22:41.800
Woods' Screw Manoeuvre?
Posterior arm?

22:41.800 --> 22:43.720
Tracy? Agnieszka? Someone.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.080
Suprapubic pressure,
rotating on all fours.

22:46.080 --> 22:47.680
We couldn't reach the posterior arm.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.480
You've emptied the bladder?  Yes.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.720
SHE WAILS
I'm going to put a hand inside

22:51.720 --> 22:53.000
to help baby out.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
SHE GROANS

22:58.240 --> 22:59.760
Fuck.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.440
I need the on-call consultant
in here now.  OK.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.960
That's four minutes.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.440
Last resort, seen it once three
years ago. Do one, teach one.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.080
I'm going to have to break your
baby's collarbone to get him out.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.120
He should heal perfectly,
but there is a chance

23:12.120 --> 23:13.440
it can damage a nerve in his arm.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.200
Please don't hurt my baby.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.360
I don't have any other option.
Please, please!

23:20.960 --> 23:23.280
4 minutes 20.  My God. My God.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.960
There's one other option. I can make
a cut to divide your pubic bone.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.600
Never seen it.  Can we have some time
to discuss this?

23:30.600 --> 23:33.680
I've got less than one minute
to get your baby delivered alive.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.200
OK. Cut the bone.

23:35.200 --> 23:36.640
SHE PANTS

23:36.640 --> 23:40.200
Local anaesthetic, needle, syringe,
catheter, scalpel.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.240
Do you understand
what I'm going to do?

23:42.240 --> 23:43.880
SHE WHIMPERS

23:43.880 --> 23:45.520
You've got this.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.960
SHE WAILS
Stay nice and calm for me, darling.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.680
Anaesthetic's going in.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.280
OK?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.240
SHE MOANS OK, darling. It's OK.

23:58.880 --> 24:00.880
BONES CRACK, SHE SCREAMS Argh! Ah.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.880
Oh, God. SHE SOBS

24:13.080 --> 24:14.360
Is he OK?

24:17.720 --> 24:19.400
Is he OK?

24:19.400 --> 24:21.680
One, 1,000.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.280
Two, 1,000.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.680

Congratulations.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.640
Fuck.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.280
That was close.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.360
You did really well in there, Adam.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.080
I thought I was a menace to society

24:54.080 --> 24:56.360
and a danger to everyone
I encounter.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.120
Can you just take a compliment?

24:59.120 --> 25:00.880
I'm not great at it, no.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.200
Can we just go back
to insulting each other?

25:08.360 --> 25:10.800
Get a haircut.  Going to have
to hit me harder than that.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.040
Fine. Get a boyfriend.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.440
HE SIGHS

25:15.720 --> 25:17.240
Maybe slightly less hard.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.560
Everything OK?

25:35.560 --> 25:37.400
I thought that baby
was going to die...

25:39.000 --> 25:40.520
..right in front of me.

25:41.760 --> 25:45.240
Yeah. Me, too, to be honest,
but, hey, it didn't.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.840
I just didn't know what to do.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.520
I was useless.  You weren't useless.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.480
You were actively
making things worse.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.000
Not calling me for three minutes,
then just standing there

25:54.000 --> 25:56.240
while all the rest of us... HE SOBS

25:59.480 --> 26:01.240
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.240
I was exactly the same as you
at this stage.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.920
Maybe a bit better.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.120
And, yeah, the job can be horrible.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.600
So, you find ways
of dealing with it.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.360
HE SOBS

26:21.360 --> 26:23.560
Give me your bleep.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.200
Take the rest of the afternoon off.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.240
Are you sure?  100%.

26:28.240 --> 26:31.880
Decompress, phone your mum,
have a wank. Separately.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.440
Come on.  Thank you, Adam.

PAGER VIBRATES AND BEEPS

27:09.960 --> 27:13.280
Right, Dad's taking me
to the station now.

Um...

27:14.680 --> 27:17.560
..I'll be late, so don't wait up.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.320
I'd check the invitation.

27:19.320 --> 27:22.720
I imagine it says dress fancy,
not fancy dress.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.440
Ha-ha.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.600
Unless you're entertaining
the kiddies' table.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.000
I get it. You don't like my clothes,

27:30.000 --> 27:32.720
you want me to be more successful,
you wish I was straight.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.800
I just want you to be happy.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.600
I was happy with Harry.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.360
Yes, but, clearly, he wasn't
that happy with you, was he?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.800
What do you know
about being happy anyway?

27:43.800 --> 27:47.960
I know that it's difficult playing
second fiddle to somebody's job.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.520
By the time you've had children,
you're third fiddle.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.680
You're practically sat back
with the cellos.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.120
Not everybody is able
to cope with that.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.000
Monica's nephew's a homosexual, too.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.920
There's a lot of it about.

28:04.920 --> 28:06.320
He's a barrister.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.920
We could...

28:08.920 --> 28:10.680
..have them all over for lunch.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.240
Oh, so it's just graphic designers

28:12.240 --> 28:14.520
that you've got a bit
of a thing against, is it?

28:19.480 --> 28:21.080
That was unkind. I'm sorry.

28:22.640 --> 28:25.080
I'm sorry if you think
I've been hard on you.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.200
I don't...

28:44.600 --> 28:46.280
..think you've been hard on me.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.280
Well, in that case, I'm going to get
you some of your father's shoes

28:53.280 --> 28:56.880
because those are barely fit
for gardening.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.800
MUSIC: Bridal Chorus by Wagner

29:25.240 --> 29:27.400
MAN:  Would you please be seated?

29:31.200 --> 29:34.920
Ladies and gentlemen,
what a beautiful setting we're in

29:34.920 --> 29:37.800
and what a beautiful reason
we're here.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.480
The celebration of love.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.280
In the words of Andrew Lloyd Webber,

29:43.280 --> 29:46.160
"Love, love changes everything."

29:47.760 --> 29:49.160
I'd go one further.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.560
Love IS everything.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.200
It completes us.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.200
It fulfils us.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.360
It makes the half whole.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.120
INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER

30:10.800 --> 30:12.720
Well, hello.

30:12.720 --> 30:14.400
Ah, hello.  Hello, Emma.  Hello.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.880
Room for a little one? OTHERS LAUGH

30:19.480 --> 30:23.880
Congratulations, Emma. The table
decorations look really amazing.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.920
Oh, they really do, don't they?

30:27.600 --> 30:29.560
Is Harry in the bathroom?

30:30.680 --> 30:32.440
No, he...he...

30:33.960 --> 30:35.600
..he didn't make it.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.400
I thought that he...

30:37.400 --> 30:39.880
..but, yeah, it was a no-show,
I'm afraid.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.000
Oh, Adam.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.040
That's awful.  Honestly, I'm having
a lovely time on my own.

30:45.040 --> 30:46.640
We've got a reserve list of 20.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.200
My cousin Harriet's fiance
couldn't have a place.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.080
They're actually IN a relationship.

30:52.400 --> 30:53.640
Sorry.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.640
How are you?

30:55.640 --> 30:57.080
I'm fine.  Yeah?

30:57.080 --> 30:58.120
Um...

30:59.640 --> 31:02.560
..would you mind if we go somewhere
private quickly?

31:03.640 --> 31:05.800
If this is about money,
can you speak to Gregory?

31:05.800 --> 31:07.320
It's not about money.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.720
No?  Can we try out here?

31:11.200 --> 31:12.360
Excuse me.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.520
Just here.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.440
I just wanted to give you this.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.840
Oh, is this a vibrator?

31:30.840 --> 31:32.720
It's not funny.  No, no, no.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.160
It's a sonic aid,
like in an antenatal clinic.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.280
I just thought the last few weeks
might be easier if, um...

31:38.280 --> 31:40.000
Anyway. Well, I'll show you.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.800
So, you press this.  Mm-hm.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.800
And, yeah, if you lift up your...

31:43.800 --> 31:45.960
Oh.  Pop this...

31:45.960 --> 31:47.400
..there.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.560
Hold on.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.680
Shit, sorry.
I think it might be dead.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.080
What?

31:54.080 --> 31:55.960
No, the battery.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.520
The battery.  Oh.

31:57.520 --> 31:58.960
Sorry, I just...

31:58.960 --> 32:01.160
Oh, no, that's on. OK.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.640
Right.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.720
HEARTBEAT

32:11.720 --> 32:13.640
HE CHUCKLES Oh!

32:13.640 --> 32:15.120
Oh.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.000
Listen.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.400
Now, you can hear Baby
whenever you want.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.160
Incredible.

32:21.160 --> 32:22.760
Thank you so much.

32:22.760 --> 32:25.920
Best wedding gift, bar none.

32:25.920 --> 32:29.480
Well, until the main present arrives
in a few weeks.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.800
Of course. When are you due?

32:30.800 --> 32:33.400
Oh, no, I meant the Maserati
from Greg.

32:33.400 --> 32:34.800
Yeah.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.360
It's got held up in Bologna.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.960
Long story.  Hm.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.960
Shall we have a photo?

32:40.960 --> 32:43.960
No, no, no, I'm all right. Oh.
HE CHUCKLES

32:45.000 --> 32:46.360
Oh.  You have to look into the...

32:46.360 --> 32:48.840
Quite fast. Is...? SHE LAUGHS

32:48.840 --> 32:50.240
Yay!  Oh.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.120
OK.  Yeah.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.400
I am sorry Harry couldn't make it.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.520
I hope you can still enjoy the day.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.120
I'm really happy for you, Greg.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.640
Ah.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.920
Well, that was almost convincing.
I mean it.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.640
Love is a very precious thing.

33:23.640 --> 33:25.200
All right, Richard Curtis.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.240
I'm sorry that Harry bailed.

33:29.840 --> 33:33.040
But that does mean
that I can set you up with Ayo.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.000
He works in derivatives,
and he's got a jawline

33:35.000 --> 33:36.760
you could cut tiles with.  I'm fine.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.280
Thank you.

33:39.280 --> 33:42.040
Anyway, that would never work.
Ayo Kay?!

33:42.040 --> 33:43.160
Gregorio!

33:43.160 --> 33:44.680
Ladam!

33:44.680 --> 33:46.560
Now, when am I up?  Probably next...

33:46.560 --> 33:47.840
..ten mins?  Ah.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.040
Right, shall we?

33:51.000 --> 33:53.480
Oh, did you guys get a chance
to chat about work stuff yet?

33:53.480 --> 33:55.920
Yeah, you got any jobs
for washed-up doctors?

33:55.920 --> 33:57.240
Every day of the week, mate.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.000
I must have placed, like, three
ex-doctors into proper, grown-up,

34:00.000 --> 34:02.800
six-figure roles -
minimum hours, maximum dosh.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.720
Dream scenario.  Really?

34:04.720 --> 34:05.880
Totalmente.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.320
I mean, think of all those
transferable skills you've got.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.880
Pulling babies out of vaginas?

34:09.880 --> 34:11.280
Uno, problem solving.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.080
Duo, time management.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.720
Tru-o, empathy.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.560
Yeah, well, that's two out of three,
then.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.360
GLASS CLINKS Ladies and gentlemen,

34:19.360 --> 34:20.960
if you could please take your seats

34:20.960 --> 34:22.960
as the evening speeches
are about to commence.

34:22.960 --> 34:26.200
Just call the office, and we'll fix
a meeting, yeah? Boom.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.480
Ding-dong, the legend's here.
Hello, everybody.

34:32.480 --> 34:36.160
My name is Welly,
AKA the well of all knowledge,

34:36.160 --> 34:39.560
and I am the best man
to young Greg, here.

34:39.560 --> 34:43.080
Now, a lot of people worry,
naturally, that marriage

34:43.080 --> 34:45.560
is the biggest mistake
they'll ever make.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.560
Not our Greg, though,
because on his gap year,

34:47.560 --> 34:49.520
he lost his virginity
to a prostitute

34:49.520 --> 34:52.280
who looked like Pavarotti. HE LAUGHS

34:52.280 --> 34:54.200
Only cost him three TENORS.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.120
That was genius.

34:56.120 --> 35:00.840
# The book of love is long
and boring

35:00.840 --> 35:04.520
# No-one can lift the damn thing

35:05.880 --> 35:10.600
# It's full of charts
and facts and figures

35:10.600 --> 35:15.000
# And instructions for dancing

35:15.000 --> 35:19.800
# But I

35:20.920 --> 35:24.920
# I love it when you read to me... #

35:25.960 --> 35:27.240
So sorry I'm late.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.960
Isn't that MY line?

35:29.960 --> 35:32.240
Did you know
there's more than one Farmborough?

35:33.520 --> 35:35.080
Yes.  And they're not close.

35:35.080 --> 35:37.040
Look, I tried to text,
but I ran out of credit.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.640
I don't care.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.200
I'm just...

35:41.200 --> 35:42.440
..glad you're here.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.000
How much have I missed?  Um...

35:47.520 --> 35:49.440
..not enough. Come on.

35:50.520 --> 35:53.320
Isn't the wedding where all those
people with dinner jackets are?

35:53.320 --> 35:55.080
Exactly.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.440
Come on.

36:01.920 --> 36:07.320
"In lieu of wedding favours,
we have made a donation

36:07.320 --> 36:09.360
"of Â£50 per person

36:09.360 --> 36:12.240
"to Chipping Norton
Donkey Sanctuary."

36:13.520 --> 36:15.160
I hate donkeys.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.600
Can I get the 50 quid for myself?
How can you hate babies?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.400
You what?  Baby horses.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.480
No, donkeys are not baby horses.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.520
Well, what are they, then?

36:27.680 --> 36:29.000
Donkeys.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.640
Oh. HE LAUGHS

36:32.640 --> 36:34.360
Well, I...I grew up in London.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.120
I...they...we didn't have any...
Schools?

36:40.640 --> 36:43.040
What would your ideal wedding be?

36:44.280 --> 36:45.600
Oh.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.560
All right, OK, um...

36:51.720 --> 36:56.240
..free booze, loads of people, like,
everyone in my contacts list...

36:56.240 --> 36:57.640
Estate agent.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.400
HSBC.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.160
Yeah, they love a party.

37:01.160 --> 37:02.400
Um...

37:03.880 --> 37:06.160
..massive curry, no speeches,

37:06.160 --> 37:07.760
karaoke,

37:07.760 --> 37:09.680
and a kebab at 3am.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.240
It sounds nice.

37:14.880 --> 37:17.080
HARRY LAUGHS

37:18.800 --> 37:21.080
Hm. We've finished it.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.240
You can't do that.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.640
Don't worry. I'll go and get it.

37:36.440 --> 37:39.040
Woo!  What are you doing?

37:39.040 --> 37:41.120
Woo! Come on, Grandad.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.800
Jesus!

37:48.800 --> 37:51.520
Oh, this is cold. HE CHUCKLES

37:51.520 --> 37:54.000
Oh, God.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.600
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.520
It's fresh.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.560
THEY LAUGH

38:03.640 --> 38:04.880
Go on, then.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.920
What would your ideal wedding be?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
Heated lake.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.680
Obviously.  Obviously.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.920
And otherwise, the same as yours.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.200
Because I'd be marrying you.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.760
Adam...

38:33.960 --> 38:35.680
Tell me we weren't good together.

38:37.960 --> 38:41.720
We were good,
but we were also quite bad.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.160
But the bad stuff was...

38:46.400 --> 38:48.000
..that was all to do with my job.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.040
You know,
medicine is not good for me.

38:54.720 --> 38:56.240
It's, um...

38:57.720 --> 38:59.600
..it's ruined my life.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.400
And it destroyed us.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.960
I don't think it was...

39:05.000 --> 39:06.240
..that simple.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.320
I'd like to say a few words.
Dr Kay, you may sit back down.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.080
On the day in question,

39:14.080 --> 39:17.400
I was working alongside
an SHO colleague

39:17.400 --> 39:19.680
called Shruti Acharya.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.280
Dr Kay...

39:21.280 --> 39:25.280
She asked me to review the patient
in triage,

39:25.280 --> 39:28.440
and then she assisted me
with the caesarean.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.680
Dr Acharya has since...

39:37.760 --> 39:40.480
Dr Acharya has since taken
her own life.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.280
On the morning she died,

39:44.280 --> 39:49.720
Shruti found out she'd passed
her Obs and Gynae membership exams,

39:49.720 --> 39:53.200
exams she worked ridiculously hard
for...

39:54.640 --> 39:56.680
..on top of the 90-hour weeks,

39:56.680 --> 39:58.480
on top of this complaint.

39:59.880 --> 40:03.000
But she didn't see this
as a success.

40:04.840 --> 40:09.120
The idea of carrying on working
in a broken system

40:09.120 --> 40:13.560
under shoddy conditions didn't feel
like any kind of future.

40:16.160 --> 40:17.840
She was a great doctor.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.840
Kind, focused, determined.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.320
And it was still too much for her.

40:31.240 --> 40:33.080
It's too much for anyone.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.560
I mean, you saw what it...

40:36.560 --> 40:38.120
..what it turned me into.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.240
I don't know
if I can do it any more.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.040
Don't leave medicine for me.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.720
One doctor,

40:51.720 --> 40:54.200
in this country,
takes their own life

40:54.200 --> 40:55.760
every three weeks.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.160
And it should be a national fucking
headline every time it happens,

41:00.160 --> 41:02.560
and instead it's just brushed
under the carpet.

41:03.880 --> 41:08.040
Doctors, nurses, midwives,
pharmacists, physios,

41:08.040 --> 41:09.880
a million and a half of them...

41:13.160 --> 41:15.600
..they don't do this
for the money,

41:15.600 --> 41:17.920
for the kudos, for the anything.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.800
They do it because they care.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.000
Day in, day out,
going the extra mile

41:26.000 --> 41:28.240
to keep the rest of us
on the road.

41:28.240 --> 41:31.000
That's a pretty fucking
special thing.

41:33.640 --> 41:37.080
And you could do yourselves a favour
to remember that once in a while.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.680
You know, I...

41:51.320 --> 41:52.680
..I really miss you.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.440
I know.

42:02.360 --> 42:05.080
This is the bit where you say
that you miss me, too.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.520
Yeah, I do.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.560
Well, if you miss me, then...

42:11.400 --> 42:13.520
..let's just...let's...

42:13.520 --> 42:15.320
Why don't we give it another go?

42:16.400 --> 42:17.960
A proper go.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.560
When you get all of me.

42:28.520 --> 42:30.120
But it's what you do.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.320
Being a doctor, it's who you are.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.200
Put your hand on your heart,

42:37.200 --> 42:39.360
and tell me
you want to give all that up.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.120
I don't think I can.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.480
It's OK.

43:14.360 --> 43:15.760
It's OK.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.840
HE SIGHS

43:46.840 --> 43:48.400
WOMAN:  Call an ambulance!

43:48.400 --> 43:50.200
Can't call an ambulance
at a hospital.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.880
Get someone, then!

43:54.000 --> 43:55.520
Hello.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.080
I'm Adam. I'm one of the doctors.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.600
What kind of a doctor?
Doesn't matter what kind!

43:59.600 --> 44:01.040
Right, hello.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.160
Baby's just sitting there,
ready to come out.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.280
Probably best if we finish
what you've started.

44:05.280 --> 44:07.280
Next contraction,
give me a nice big push.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.480
Have you got anything
to put down on the seats?

44:09.480 --> 44:11.640
Oh, is that ever going to come out
of the upholstery?

44:11.640 --> 44:13.760
SHE SCREAMS Honestly, Tim!

44:13.760 --> 44:15.240
Shoelaces.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.560
You're doing so well.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.800
SHE WHIMPERS

44:18.800 --> 44:20.880
Push, push. Push, push, push!

44:20.880 --> 44:22.520
Here we go.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.600
SHE WAILS

44:24.600 --> 44:26.600
BABY CRIES

44:27.920 --> 44:29.440
Congratulations.

44:30.600 --> 44:31.920
Oh!

44:31.920 --> 44:33.480
Laces.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.520
Something to cut the cord?

44:40.240 --> 44:41.800
Hi.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.000
What do we do now?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.360
I think you have to feed it
for a few years,

44:51.360 --> 44:53.800
let it live in your house,
and then send it to school.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.000
Right, labour ward's
on the second floor

44:58.000 --> 44:59.880
of that building there. Um...

45:01.400 --> 45:03.720
..just give me a minute,
and I'll get you up there.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.560
Thank you so much, Dr...

45:05.560 --> 45:07.600
Adam's a good name.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.600
Oh.

45:15.600 --> 45:16.680
For fuck's sake.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.840
# This is going to sting

45:21.440 --> 45:23.600
# This is going to slay you

45:24.960 --> 45:27.360
# This is going to break your heart

45:28.440 --> 45:30.600
# It's going to tear you apart

45:32.040 --> 45:34.160
# It's going to make
your eyes water

45:35.520 --> 45:38.160
# Oh, it's a major, major trauma

45:39.720 --> 45:41.600
# Yes, this is going to hurt

45:42.680 --> 45:45.560
# Hurt me more than love. #
