I can get him out of here,
but it has to be now,

00:18.086 --> 00:20.190
‐and before anyone else...
‐Mom, listen,
I have been out there.

00:20.223 --> 00:22.929
‐This isn't a good idea.
‐You think I want this?

00:22.962 --> 00:24.699
I just got you back
from the dead.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.235
Please, I just
want to find your mom.

04:04.004 --> 04:05.908
Capuchins are actually
incredibly smart.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.814
‐You can‐you can train 'em
to help paraplegics. You can...
‐Ha.

04:08.847 --> 04:12.722
So you rescued him...
from a paraplegic, huh?

04:12.755 --> 04:15.728
Uh, no, I rescued him
from eating lipstick for science

04:15.761 --> 04:16.897
for the rest of his life.

Can't get over

It's kind of creepy, right?

04:39.007 --> 04:40.711
Do we have anything to eat?

04:42.815 --> 04:45.086
We have to ration till I can

a wrench?

04:48.894 --> 04:50.898
Bolts.

04:50.931 --> 04:55.073
Unscrew 'em. We can trade

04:57.310 --> 04:59.114
‐Jesus Christ,
‐No, no, no, no,

04:59.147 --> 05:00.784
‐that thing's, like, 50 pounds.
‐don't pick that up.

05:00.818 --> 05:01.987
Don't pick that up.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.258
I learned it in Iraq.

05:08.232 --> 05:10.403
Is it... Uh, that's it?
Oh, okay. Wow.

05:10.436 --> 05:13.342
You are just a delightfully
open book, Agent Burgin.

05:13.376 --> 05:15.981
‐That's not my name.
‐Holy shit, lady,
are you serious?

05:16.015 --> 05:17.250
Definitely don't call me lady.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.254
Call me 355.

05:19.288 --> 05:21.125
Okay, cool.
Call me Trapezoid.

05:21.158 --> 05:23.563
‐Are you... Come on,
that's not your real name.
‐By design.

05:23.597 --> 05:25.768
Well, who designed it?

05:27.237 --> 05:29.007
Look, my mom already told me
you're part of some,

05:29.041 --> 05:31.378
like, super‐secret spy thing.

05:31.412 --> 05:33.316
That sounds exciting.
Did you always want to be a spy,

05:33.349 --> 05:34.786
or was it, like,
part of the family business,

05:34.819 --> 05:36.455
‐or did you...
‐Bolts.

05:41.398 --> 05:43.102
I don't know, maybe we
should have gotten all the way

05:43.135 --> 05:45.139
to Boston before
we ditched our ride.

05:45.173 --> 05:47.210
It's too visible.
It's the only light in the sky.

05:48.412 --> 05:50.884
‐We got to keep a low profile.
‐And, uh,

05:50.918 --> 05:52.989
how long till they realize that
two helicopters are missing?

05:53.022 --> 05:55.493
When they do, they'll be looking
for the two missing pilots

05:55.527 --> 05:58.099
that stole them.

06:15.199 --> 06:17.905
My feet are killing me.

06:17.938 --> 06:20.911
Five minutes.

06:37.077 --> 06:39.047
That's not creepy at all.

06:51.906 --> 06:53.944
What'd I tell you?

06:53.977 --> 06:56.482
‐Be careful.
‐There's nobody here.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.189
Oh, God.

07:00.223 --> 07:03.530
Oh... Oh, God,
that's so good.

07:06.402 --> 07:08.940
‐Do you smell that?
‐What?

07:08.974 --> 07:11.613
Exactly.
No bodies?

07:11.646 --> 07:14.084
Why do you sound disappointed?

07:14.117 --> 07:16.055
I...

07:16.088 --> 07:18.125
'Cause if no one's dead,

07:18.159 --> 07:21.198
‐maybe they're still here.
‐Oh...

07:21.231 --> 07:22.935
‐Hello?!
‐Shh.

07:22.968 --> 07:24.071
Hello?!

07:28.947 --> 07:31.251

07:37.464 --> 07:39.602
Okay, fine.

07:49.488 --> 07:52.360
Did I ever tell you
I had a riding coach?

07:52.393 --> 07:55.266
Coach Karen.

07:55.299 --> 07:57.505
She had a son, too.
Benji.

07:57.538 --> 08:00.009
He loved horses,
the little creep.

08:00.042 --> 08:01.411
And he was homeschooled.

08:01.445 --> 08:04.451
Oh, Benji the Homeschooled
Horse Boy?

08:06.723 --> 08:08.693
My mom always wanted me
to make friends

08:08.727 --> 08:10.597
with the girls at the barn.

08:10.631 --> 08:14.070
I had more in common
with the horses.

08:17.277 --> 08:19.314
Wow.
(chuckles)

08:19.347 --> 08:21.018
Holy shit.

08:21.051 --> 08:23.155
I haven't seen one of those
in a while.

08:25.359 --> 08:27.230

‐Uh... (laughs)

08:27.263 --> 08:29.301
Yeah, that's good, that's good.

08:48.773 --> 08:50.577

‐There's no point.

08:50.611 --> 08:53.482
We'd get, like, half a mile

08:53.517 --> 08:55.186
No, no, they're clearing
a section of 95.

08:55.219 --> 08:56.355
We might get lucky.

08:58.727 --> 08:59.729
I need a night.

08:59.762 --> 09:02.033
‐No.
‐One night.

09:02.066 --> 09:04.639
‐Uh, I'm sorry, fuck no.
‐Please?

09:04.672 --> 09:06.776
It's just one night.
We'll sleep there.

09:06.809 --> 09:10.149
We'll go first thing
in the morning, I promise.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.187

that I had more time, okay?

09:12.220 --> 09:15.594

get my head around it.

That is infected.

17:38.131 --> 17:40.870
Sam, can you try
to find gauze, saline?

17:40.904 --> 17:42.674
Anything.

17:42.708 --> 17:43.876
Can you tell me how
this happened?

17:45.780 --> 17:49.120
A shovel.
She was chasing away crows.

17:49.153 --> 17:51.191
Okay.

17:51.224 --> 17:53.061
Well, I'm sure she wants
her mom close by.

17:53.095 --> 17:55.032
You want to come here?

17:56.101 --> 17:58.305
Okay.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.744
I'm just gonna
lift the bandage off,

18:00.777 --> 18:03.248
so deep breath on the count
of three, okay? One, two,

18:03.281 --> 18:05.954

18:11.832 --> 18:14.905

This needs to be drained.

Where are you two staying?

18:19.848 --> 18:23.288
Um... we know a place.

18:23.321 --> 18:25.125

‐Yeah.

19:17.697 --> 19:20.068
Okay.
I got this one.

19:20.102 --> 19:21.337
Oh, look!

19:21.371 --> 19:24.343
Oh, man.
Score.

19:24.377 --> 19:26.649
Wait, wait, what do you have?

19:26.682 --> 19:28.285
Here, here.

19:28.318 --> 19:31.926
‐Can I help you?
‐(gasps)
‐(gasps) Oh. Uh...

19:31.959 --> 19:33.796
Good morning.

19:33.830 --> 19:35.633
Didn't mean to scare you.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.938
Can I help you, though?

19:37.971 --> 19:40.142
We didn't know
anyone else was out here.

19:42.948 --> 19:45.385
‐You got any food?
‐That you can spare?

19:45.419 --> 19:47.791
No, I don't think I do.
Sorry.

19:47.824 --> 19:49.393
Is it just you, or...

19:49.427 --> 19:51.866
You got two tents.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.370
No, I'm with my sister.
She's by the river.

19:54.403 --> 19:57.009
‐Huh.
‐You served?

19:57.042 --> 19:58.813
What?

19:58.846 --> 20:01.986
‐Where'd you get the jacket?
‐Found it.

20:02.019 --> 20:05.025
Oh.

20:05.058 --> 20:06.394
You got a dog or something?

20:06.427 --> 20:08.031
No, I've been trying
to use it as a trap,

20:08.064 --> 20:10.770
but I haven't had
much luck with it.

20:10.803 --> 20:13.008
Definitely not enough
to feed two extra mouths, so...

20:13.041 --> 20:14.410

become poor by giving.

20:42.433 --> 20:45.339
That's garbage.

20:45.372 --> 20:48.278
Unbelievable.
What if they saw your face?

20:48.311 --> 20:49.948
‐They didn't see my face.
‐They could have been armed.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.219
They didn't see my face,
I didn't get shot,

20:52.253 --> 20:54.257
and you didn't up the body count
by two more.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.137
I think we need to
establish some ground rules.

21:01.170 --> 21:02.473
Great. Yeah.
How about number one,

21:02.507 --> 21:03.943

21:03.976 --> 21:05.345
You do not wander off.

21:05.379 --> 21:07.984
You do not talk to anyone.
You...

21:10.455 --> 21:12.026
You got something to say to me?

21:12.059 --> 21:14.765
You told me not to talk, so...
