WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:09.760
NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:48.200 --> 01:49.600
I miss her.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.360
We were always there for each other

01:58.440 --> 02:00.040
in the most important moments.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.960
The war between our families
will be bloody.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.240
And no one will emerge victorious from it.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.920
Lots of bad things have happened,

02:13.360 --> 02:16.480
but it would be good for us
to forget about this, uh…

02:18.120 --> 02:19.840
unfortunate incident.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.720
Unfortunate <i>incident?</i>

02:21.800 --> 02:23.400
Oh, excuse me.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.200
I should have said, "after this tragedy."

02:28.000 --> 02:31.200
She wouldn't be happy… seeing you crying.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.440
Look, I'll tell you one time,
and I won't say it again.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.600
This is Sicily.
It's my territory.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.640
You will never step a foot in here again.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.080
I will make sure of it.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.400
If you break the rule,

02:56.000 --> 02:59.120
I will turn your ridiculous island
into a graveyard.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.480
Tell them
to get the fuck out of here. Now.

03:20.840 --> 03:21.960
Take your dog…

03:24.560 --> 03:25.760
and leave.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.800
You have one hour.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.480
One.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.400
I had something to do.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.760
All right, I'm coming.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.360
I've missed you so much.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.680
It's too soon.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.600
The doctor said that it's too soon.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.440
I don't care what the doctor said.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
Baby…

06:28.520 --> 06:29.520
Baby?

06:34.320 --> 06:36.440
I know how I feel, and I know what I need.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.880
And it's definitely not lying in a bed
and feeling sorry for myself.

07:11.800 --> 07:13.200
Bang, bang!

07:13.280 --> 07:16.080
No way! Look at you!

07:16.160 --> 07:17.320
You made it downstairs!

07:18.560 --> 07:20.080
But shouldn't you be resting?

07:21.680 --> 07:24.520
What is it with you and resting?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.840
I've had enough rest
to last me a lifetime.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.360
I'm tired of lying in bed
and having you baby me.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.480
Raquel,
please bring us a bottle of wine.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.600
Ooh.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.320
That's hardcore.
It's not even00 yet.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.080
That's bad, even for me.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.360
Need I remind you that you almost died?

07:47.440 --> 07:50.600
-Getting drunk at breakfast is a bad idea.
-For fuck's sake.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.600
Why does everyone suddenly
think they know what I need?

07:54.680 --> 07:56.960
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

08:00.960 --> 08:03.480
-Thank you.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.960
I've never been so afraid of losing you.

08:18.000 --> 08:18.840
And Massimo…

08:21.120 --> 08:22.600
…his heart nearly broke.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.560
Olo, I know how hard it was for you
and I know you're worried about me,

08:35.160 --> 08:37.120
but I've been given a second chance.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.240
I want to make the most of it.

08:48.080 --> 08:52.720
Besides, we haven't even toasted
to you changing your mind about marriage.

09:02.920 --> 09:03.920
What?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.080
Nothing.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.840
I'm just happy you're here.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.240
Oh!

09:22.320 --> 09:24.720
More, more, more alcohol.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.560
I can't look
at that hair sober.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.320
-Oof.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.400
Uh, hello, Giuseppe?
Can we fix hair today?

09:40.120 --> 09:42.280
Right now? Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.120
Yeah, we're coming!

09:45.240 --> 09:46.680
Of course. Bye. See you!

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
Oh.

10:01.880 --> 10:02.880
You have a meeting.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.160
I'm <i>so </i>sorry.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.600
I didn't wanna disturb you.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.200
Could you come and see me
when you're done?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.640
Excuse me.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.400
-Be quiet.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.040
I'm cumming. I'm cumming.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.320
They are waiting for me.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.360
Wow.
So you're ready to go, then.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
You just had sex.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.400
And what makes you say that?

13:04.480 --> 13:06.400
You're not wearing any panties.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.760
But that's not the only thing.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.400
Your hair…

13:12.960 --> 13:14.160
and your lipstick.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.640
So what? We bumped into each other

13:16.720 --> 13:17.760
"And I fucked him."

13:19.520 --> 13:20.640
Yes, I fucked him.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.080
Listen, I want to hear
every kinky little detail, got it?

13:25.440 --> 13:29.800
Quit smirking and come help me,
or we'll never get out the door.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.880
I've already got
everything picked out. Here.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
This one?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.960
-Or this one?
-The black one.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.320
-Hey! Stop!
-Tell me everything.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.360
Lari!

13:58.200 --> 14:00.160
Did you tell Massimo we were going out?

14:00.240 --> 14:03.040
Obviously… not!

14:04.760 --> 14:06.720
He doesn't tell me when he goes out.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.960
Fuck. Well, this is gonna be interesting!

14:10.480 --> 14:13.120
-Come on, really? This place?
-What's the big deal?

14:13.200 --> 14:16.240
All the good restaurants
in town belong to the Torricellis.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.160
Let's go.

14:56.880 --> 15:00.680
Now,
that's what I call a food baby.

15:01.320 --> 15:03.160
Well, just more to love.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.480
Oof.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.160
Hello?

15:16.160 --> 15:18.720
<i>Hi, Busy Bee.</i>

15:23.360 --> 15:24.480
Wait a second, please.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.080
Where did you get my number?

15:49.200 --> 15:52.320
<i>You know… I am who I am.</i>

15:54.000 --> 15:55.040
<i>You know my roots.</i>

15:56.560 --> 15:58.440
<i>So… how are you?</i>

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
Why are you calling?

16:02.000 --> 16:05.120
<i>'Cause… I can't forget about you.</i>

16:13.200 --> 16:14.480
So, try harder.

16:40.680 --> 16:41.840
Who was that?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.880
-How was everything?
-Great. Thanks.

16:49.960 --> 16:50.840
Thank you.

17:00.440 --> 17:01.960
Tell me the truth.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.760
Olo, sometimes the truth is complicated.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.880
Lari, what happened on that island?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.800
-He was just different.
-Who?

17:23.880 --> 17:24.880
Nacho.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.760
I ran away with him
after Massimo cheated with Anna.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.840
Hold on. I thought
that was a plot against Massimo.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.200
It was,
but I didn't know it at the time.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.440
Nacho was like my… best friend.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.360
Seriously? You saw the guy twice,
and now he's your best friend?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.320
Whatever. I'm not here to lecture you.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.800
Sure sounds like it.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.560
Did you sleep with him?

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
No.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.240
But he was there for me
when my whole world was falling apart.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.240
He took care of me, and I felt free.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.240
Okay.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.600
I have to forget about him.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.680
Oh my God.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.360
You're in love with him.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.880
Don't be ridiculous. He's just some guy.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
Okay, come on.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
We're going dancing.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.360
Since when do you go out without me?

20:54.800 --> 20:56.520
Since I was 18.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.000
Have you danced yet?

21:00.560 --> 21:01.560
Oh, yeah.

21:02.760 --> 21:06.600
A little, before Domenico
almost killed Olga with his tongue.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.200
Leave.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.720
Stay.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.120
Leave.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.840
Why don't you sleep?

26:49.440 --> 26:50.680
I can't without you.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.440
"I can't without you."

27:08.200 --> 27:09.640
What happened on the island?

27:13.080 --> 27:15.560
Baby, I think
that you are drunk, and, um…

27:16.640 --> 27:19.040
Maybe we can talk about this another time?

27:19.120 --> 27:20.400
Answer me!

27:21.480 --> 27:24.720
You'd like to know what happened?
Your ex shot me.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.800
What happened between you and Matos?

27:28.880 --> 27:29.920
Nothing happened.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.080
Liar.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.960
You ran away with him when you thought
that I was cheating on you with Anna.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.320
It would've never happened
if you'd told me about your twin brother!

27:38.840 --> 27:40.800
My twin brother?

27:41.920 --> 27:44.560
That twin brother
that told me that you were pregnant?

27:44.640 --> 27:48.360
I wanted to protect the family,
and I knew what you would do

27:48.440 --> 27:51.080
if you found out
that I'd lost the baby in the accident.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.320
I didn't want to be
the cause of another war.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.440
You had no right…

28:02.320 --> 28:05.160
no right to hide it from me.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.040
It was my baby.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.440
It was <i>our </i>baby,
who died because of <i>your </i>enemies.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.040
Because of me.

28:57.480 --> 28:58.720
Wait a moment.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.080
I have to clean.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.120
My God, you're so wet.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.040
What's wrong?

31:48.160 --> 31:49.000
Um…

31:49.800 --> 31:51.200
I think I have a hangover.

31:52.840 --> 31:53.920
Hangover?

31:54.880 --> 31:55.920
No.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.800
I think you're hiding something from me.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.240
-Mm!

32:27.320 --> 32:28.640
Hm.

33:56.400 --> 33:57.880
Sorry, <i>maestro.</i>

33:59.040 --> 34:00.480
Rematch later?

34:04.160 --> 34:05.000
Yeah?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.120
What do you mean?

34:10.880 --> 34:11.880
What?

34:13.400 --> 34:15.080
And you're just telling me this now?

34:16.400 --> 34:18.440
No. Fix this today.

34:18.520 --> 34:19.760
I don't give a shit.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.560
Massimo, what's wrong?

34:30.320 --> 34:32.440
Giuseppe fucked up, as usual.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.600
I've known you my entire life.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.400
These kinds of things never get to you.

34:38.120 --> 34:41.040
Either you're getting old,
or something else is up.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.280
-Tommy.
-Yeah?

34:43.800 --> 34:45.040
I'm out.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.760
Emi, hi.

35:15.240 --> 35:16.800
I will be in the atelier today.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
Please expect me.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.440
Thank you.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.040
Hey!
Why the hell are you in such a hurry?

35:36.680 --> 35:40.240
My marriage is falling apart,
so I'm focusing on my career.

35:40.320 --> 35:41.360
Now, come on!

35:41.440 --> 35:46.080
That's great,
but do we really have to walk this much?

35:48.360 --> 35:49.960
I'm so over this.

35:52.880 --> 35:56.160
-I like those colors.
-I know, but that's too fancy.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.840
-Yeah, it's too much.
-Yes.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.600
[Olga singing off-key,

36:20.920 --> 36:25.440
That's Michele, but he's very moody.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.080
Very.

36:30.040 --> 36:34.520
Laura, do you realize
how much work we still have?

36:35.040 --> 36:41.320
Yeah, and this is so perfect because,
you know, I will keep my head busy.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.240
Check this out.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.520
-The first one.
-<i>It's great.</i>

36:56.200 --> 36:58.160
It has wide sleeves.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.040
Got it! What about this one?

37:02.440 --> 37:04.280
<i>-Ciao!</i>

37:04.880 --> 37:05.720
Hi!

37:05.800 --> 37:08.080
Hiya, Mama Klara!

37:08.840 --> 37:10.520
I'm getting married!

37:10.600 --> 37:13.040
-Okay, Mom…
-<i>Really? Congratulations!</i>

37:13.120 --> 37:14.800
-Like the dress?
-I'll call later.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.200
Beautiful!

37:16.280 --> 37:18.360
-My little…
-I'll call you. Bye. Love you.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.920
Kisses. Bye.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.920
-Bye!
-Bye!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.680
That was nice.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.920
The photographer
needs to be tall and handsome.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.800
Why? 'Cause I say so.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.560
Plus, if the photos are from below,
it'll look like we have double chins,

38:12.640 --> 38:13.920
which we don't want.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.800
Just like this. Click, click, click.

38:16.520 --> 38:20.040
Okay, fine. He can be short and handsome,
but he's gonna need a ladder.

38:20.120 --> 38:20.960
Olo!

38:21.040 --> 38:22.040
Thank you. <i>Grazie.</i>

38:26.600 --> 38:29.680
And then I'll plop my bare ass
right on the cake.

38:31.040 --> 38:32.840
Shit, you're not listening to me.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.040
I <i>am </i>listening.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.680
What kind of photographer do I want?

38:40.280 --> 38:42.040
One with his ass in the cake.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.040
You're unbelievable!

38:46.960 --> 38:48.040
I can't believe you!

39:07.120 --> 39:08.520
Massimo, let's go.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.800
I'll catch up with you later.

39:52.400 --> 39:55.560
-On your knees.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.760
-Morning.
-Ma'am!

41:59.840 --> 42:01.760
-Not now.
-Ma'am!

42:23.080 --> 42:26.400
I didn't know
you were coming early today.

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
Apparently.

42:41.480 --> 42:42.640
My new muse.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.520
I guess I'll have benefits from it, yeah?

43:27.440 --> 43:30.000
Did you see the email?
Go on, read it!

43:32.800 --> 43:35.080
We're going to Portugal!

43:43.920 --> 43:45.960
Hey, girls,
it's only00 a.m.,

43:46.040 --> 43:47.240
and you're already drunk.

43:47.320 --> 43:50.800
Um, yeah,
because we're going to Lagos Fashion Fair.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.880
-Uh, for the fashion fair.
-Yes.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.480
Oh, that's wonderful.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.560
Look.

44:01.080 --> 44:02.880
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.360
Ah! Oh!

44:09.440 --> 44:11.440
Sorry, sorry. Oh.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.440
I'm here.

44:16.960 --> 44:20.080
Sorry, I couldn't leave <i>amore mio</i>
with a hard-on.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.360
And now… what happens
in Lagos stays in Lagos!

45:13.240 --> 45:16.480
-They were in the villa the entire time?
-The whole day, why?

45:23.840 --> 45:25.640
He didn't even come to say goodbye?

45:29.120 --> 45:30.920
I don't think we can fix this.

45:53.680 --> 45:55.080
How much longer?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.080
Nailed it.

46:36.640 --> 46:38.200
You're such a drunk.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.800
Are you trying
to fucking scare me to death?

46:41.880 --> 46:43.320
What are you wearing?

46:43.400 --> 46:45.520
You're going out drinking with me in this?

46:45.600 --> 46:47.600
Olo, I'm exhausted!

46:47.680 --> 46:50.080
We've got a big meeting tomorrow.
I want to rest.

46:50.160 --> 46:53.040
I can't believe you!

46:53.120 --> 46:58.200
-Weren't you the one talking about change?
-Watch me.

46:58.280 --> 47:01.120
-"I'm back from the dead!"
-Look at me. I'm lying down.

47:01.200 --> 47:04.760
-Wait, what was it you said?
-I'm beginning to live.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.560
What a poet.
Shame you don't practice what you preach.

47:07.640 --> 47:11.800
-Get up! I'm not sitting around all day!
-Ola, no!

47:11.880 --> 47:14.000
-You have one minute!
-You're crazy!

47:14.080 --> 47:16.960
-The clock is ticking! Sixty!
-Olo!

47:17.040 --> 47:21.680
-Fifty-nine, fifty-eight…
-Fifty-nine, fifty-eight…

47:52.400 --> 47:55.520
Hey,
the view's pretty good down here.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.920
-Olo?
-What?

48:01.920 --> 48:03.800
Aren't you engaged?

48:03.880 --> 48:05.040
Pfft.

48:05.120 --> 48:06.440
I'm just looking.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.360
Ah.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.920
His board's nice too.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.320
Hey, cocktails.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.280
Thank you.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.880
I don't get it.

48:50.440 --> 48:55.000
How can you be that into
messing up your hair in the waves?

48:55.080 --> 48:57.320
-There's something primal about it.
-What?

48:59.920 --> 49:01.400
It's just you and the water.

49:01.920 --> 49:03.160
What? You and the water?

49:03.240 --> 49:06.520
What are you, a surfing guru?
Have you ever even stood on a board?

49:06.600 --> 49:08.440
-Yeah.
-When?

49:08.520 --> 49:10.360
-This one time.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.360
Except I spent most of my time
in the water.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.640
Why am I not surprised?

49:19.800 --> 49:25.680
<i>Now give it up</i>
<i>for our champion, Marcelo Nacho Matos!</i>

49:27.360 --> 49:28.920
Whoo-hoo!

49:33.760 --> 49:34.920
What?

49:44.160 --> 49:45.400
Olo, we have to go.

49:45.480 --> 49:48.440
-Are you crazy? We just got here.
-We have to leave now.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.600
What's up with you?

49:51.080 --> 49:52.200
That's him.

49:52.280 --> 49:53.280
Who?

49:53.800 --> 49:55.680
-Nacho.
-What nachos?

49:55.760 --> 49:58.360
The guy who got me from the ball.
He can't see me.

49:59.800 --> 50:00.920
-Here he comes.
-What?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.560
-Walking towards us.
-Here?

50:02.640 --> 50:03.480
No.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.960
-Oh, wait, he is.
-Let's go.

50:08.040 --> 50:08.920
Shush.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.880
-He's with some chick.
-What chick?

50:11.960 --> 50:14.440
-Blonde. Cute. Nice legs…
-What?

50:14.960 --> 50:16.320
She's pretty hot.

50:23.440 --> 50:26.040
-That's his sister Amelia.
-You met his sister?

50:26.120 --> 50:28.280
-What about his mom? Grandma too?
-Stop it.

50:28.800 --> 50:32.560
-Olo, I have to get out of here.
-I'll shield you with my body.

50:35.920 --> 50:36.760
Go, now.

50:36.840 --> 50:38.000
Whoo-hoo!

50:38.080 --> 50:41.480
I love surfing, so, so much!

50:41.560 --> 50:42.720
Go, quick.

50:42.760 --> 50:45.480
Bravo! Whoo!

50:51.880 --> 50:53.840
I don't fucking believe it!

50:56.040 --> 50:59.760
Now tell me everything.
I want every little detail.

54:49.200 --> 54:50.400
Fuck…

55:17.560 --> 55:18.800
Over here!

55:18.880 --> 55:22.360
Where? Hey, Lari. Let's go to the bar.

55:25.600 --> 55:30.240
One cold beer,
served by a hot bartender, please.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.280
The best local beer
for the gorgeous friend.

55:34.360 --> 55:36.880
-Oh, thank you.
-You're welcome.

55:37.400 --> 55:41.600
Well, Olo, that beer
goes really well with your dress.

55:41.680 --> 55:44.400
I've been classy for over an hour now.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.480
This is long overdue.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.160
-One glass of champagne.
-Sure.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.480
Champagne, champagne.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.640
So bougie!

55:54.720 --> 55:56.320
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

55:57.480 --> 55:58.600
Mrs. Torricelli!

55:58.680 --> 56:01.760
Hi, I'm Maria.
We wrote to each other. Nice to meet you.

56:01.840 --> 56:04.920
Uh, it's a pleasure.
But please, call me Laura.

56:05.000 --> 56:05.880
Okay, Laura.

56:05.960 --> 56:08.440
I'll show you around
and introduce you to a few people.

56:08.520 --> 56:09.720
-Shall we?
-Yeah, okay.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.320
You coming?

56:13.120 --> 56:14.000
Hey.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.360
What's up?

56:41.160 --> 56:45.000
-Another beer, please.
-Come, please.

56:45.080 --> 56:46.560
No!

56:46.640 --> 56:48.480
No, no! Please! Please!

56:48.560 --> 56:51.200
Darling! Please!

56:51.280 --> 56:55.040
Let go of me, for fuck's sake!
What the hell is this?

56:56.600 --> 56:57.440
Please!

57:07.720 --> 57:10.200
Laura? You look amazing!

57:10.280 --> 57:11.680
Oh my God, Amelia.

57:11.760 --> 57:14.400
Oh my God.
And that dress! Where is this from?

57:14.480 --> 57:18.160
Um, it's from my new collection.
Actually, the first one.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.480
No way.

57:19.560 --> 57:20.920
When I'm gonna be back in shape,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.360
I'm gonna become
your most faithful client, I swear.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.560
-Girl, you rock it.
-Thank you.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.080
Look at this.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.280
Oh yeah, that's nice.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.760
I think
you would look great in it.

57:32.840 --> 57:33.880
Wow. Amazing.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.720
It's beautiful.

57:38.040 --> 57:38.880
Let's go.

57:56.200 --> 57:57.800
Let go of me!

57:57.880 --> 57:59.480
Mrs. Olga, please stop.

57:59.560 --> 58:04.720
Vittorio, listen.
I'll go to my room by my own.

58:04.800 --> 58:08.080
Mrs. Torricelli told me
to lock you in your room.

58:08.720 --> 58:10.960
What? That rat!

58:11.040 --> 58:11.880
Go.

58:11.960 --> 58:14.960
Mrs. Tortellini
can kiss my ass!

58:15.040 --> 58:16.200
Stay here!

58:19.800 --> 58:20.800
Fuck!

58:38.760 --> 58:42.640
I'm glad to see you in good shape.
I was really worried about you.

58:44.680 --> 58:46.800
But you know, not only me.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.680
You know, my brother
was like a shadow of a man.

58:53.920 --> 58:57.000
Laura, you know
he's not a bad person, right?

58:58.760 --> 58:59.760
He's just…

59:01.760 --> 59:03.320
He's just loyal to his father.

59:04.560 --> 59:06.440
It doesn't justify the way he treated me.

59:06.520 --> 59:08.960
I know.
And when I found out what he had done,

59:09.040 --> 59:10.760
I didn't talk to him, like, for a week.

59:16.600 --> 59:18.160
I know he hurt you deeply.

59:19.400 --> 59:23.760
But believe me,
he has learned a very painful lesson.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.320
Hear him out at least.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.040
-Shut up! What are you doing?
-Oh!

59:55.120 --> 59:56.200
I want to sleep!

59:56.280 --> 59:59.480
Hello, my dear friend!
Do you have a local beer?

59:59.560 --> 1:00:01.800
Shut up! I want to sleep!

1:00:09.680 --> 1:00:10.680
Fuck me.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:12.560
Okay.

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:16.080
Some friend she is.

1:00:18.680 --> 1:00:22.960
She's out there getting laid,
and she locks me away in a hotel room.

1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.600
Without a single drop of alcohol!

1:00:28.400 --> 1:00:30.360
She'll pay for this.

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:32.600
There we go. There we go.

1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:37.760
Fuck! No stairs.

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.480
Help!

1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:48.280
Hello! Do you hear me?
Can you help me, please?

1:00:48.360 --> 1:00:53.880
Mrs. Olga, please! Back to your room!
I must go to Mrs. Torricelli!

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:57.400
What is wrong with you?
I want to go to the party right now!

1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:58.680
Goddammit!

1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:09.320
How could you do this to me?

1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.160
Everything was so perfect
until you showed up.

1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:39.040
-I think I'm in love with you.

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:43.640
-Shh.

1:02:45.800 --> 1:02:47.040
Don't say anything.

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:31.520
I don't live here.

1:03:33.200 --> 1:03:34.280
It was a mistake.

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:38.080
But we can fix it.

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:39.480
Make yourself at home.

1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:16.320
Nothing special.

1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:19.200
I know.

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:23.960
Come…

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:26.640
I wanna show you something.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:42.040
You can run away from me…

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.840
but you can't run away from what you feel.

1:05:48.720 --> 1:05:50.120
How do you know what I feel?

1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:00.280
Your body is a worse liar than you are.

1:06:24.400 --> 1:06:26.480
I need to go back to the hotel.

1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:28.240
I will drive you.

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:33.440
You've already lost your way once.

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:39.560
Nacho…

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:43.560
I need time.

1:06:48.120 --> 1:06:49.800
I will give you time, Little Bee.

1:06:53.040 --> 1:06:54.040
I'll be waiting.

1:06:55.840 --> 1:06:57.600
Even for the rest of my life.

1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:01.960
Maybe you will have to wait forever.

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:09.680
It won't change anything.

1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:22.360
My purse.

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:36.000
Are you sure?

1:07:41.840 --> 1:07:42.680
Laura…

1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:45.200
You think that I want only--

1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.040
I will love you.

1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:54.200
I will protect you.

1:08:58.160 --> 1:08:59.080
I

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:01.480
will never

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:03.280
hurt you.

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:36.960
I wanna see.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.760
What do you wanna see?

1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:09.120
Exactly this.

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.240
I want to watch it forever.

1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:06.400
You're worried.

1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:13.800
For sure, Massimo got mad
because he wasn't able to track me.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:20.640
If you don't want to,
you don't have to go back.

1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:26.680
It would be the easiest way.
But at this moment, I--

1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:27.760
Laura.

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.520
I'm not like him.

1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:34.960
I won't force you to do anything.

1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:37.640
You will always have a choice.

1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:40.800
That's why I saved his life.

1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:44.080
What did you say?

1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:49.200
-He hasn't told you…
-Told me what?

1:13:51.560 --> 1:13:55.600
When Anna shot you instead of Massimo,
she tried to shoot him again.

1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:59.360
I didn't allow it. I killed her.

1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:07.120
So you saved Massimo's life.

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:09.440
Why?

1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:12.640
Because you love him.

1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:15.800
Laura…

1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:19.560
I don't want my happiness
at the cost of your suffering.

1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:23.720
I want you to want me.

1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:31.440
It would be easier for you.

1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:43.960
Bee, you don't have to be with me
because you don't have another choice.

1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:48.240
I want you to choose life with me.

1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:01.160
I will wait for you… until you're ready.

1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:58.920
Where have you been?

1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:02.880
At the banquet.

1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:06.080
After the banquet?

1:16:07.720 --> 1:16:09.200
I went for a walk, to think.

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:14.920
For a walk?

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:20.120
To think?

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:26.680
Mm.

1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:34.640
You…

1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:37.720
dirty…

1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:40.800
liar!

1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:44.920
Massimo…

1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:49.800
I'm one step away
from asking you for a divorce.

1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:53.360
Divorce?

1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.080
What is this? New?

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.200
Huh?

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:08.320
Who did you talk to?

1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:11.960
Huh?

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:16.480
I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:25.760
When I got shot,
our relationship almost died with me.

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:29.760
I was trying to save it,
and you, you were speculating

1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:33.240
and diving into your dark limbo,
which I was not allowed to enter.

1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:36.240
Now I'm in my own limbo.

1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:39.400
I don't know what I want,
but I'm alone there.

1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:46.960
And I need space to find out what I feel.

1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:48.760
Can you stop?

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:51.960
Stop!

1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:01.440
Look at you.

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.280
Look at me.

1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:05.000
There's no us.

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:08.200
This white shit has replaced me.

1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:17.440
I'm going to leave it.

1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:22.440
I'm going to sleep in Olga's room tonight.

1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:26.080
And I expect you
to leave for Sicily tomorrow

1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:28.080
to give me the time and space I need.

1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.240
And do not think of following me.

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:44.200
Laura!

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:48.440
Fuck!

1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:43.360
<i>I return to Sicily.</i>

1:19:44.560 --> 1:19:46.080
<i>The plane is to your disposal.</i>

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:46.120
-Whoo!

1:20:46.200 --> 1:20:48.600
Well played.

1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:51.120
You managed to lock this tiger in a cage.

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:56.480
Fucking hell.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.720
Have you completely lost
your fucking mind?

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:02.160
You've gone crazy
for some dick you hardly know

1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:04.440
just because he makes you wet?

1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:07.040
What now, Lari? Hmm?

1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:12.080
Well? Are you going to break up
your marriage and family for him?

1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:13.560
I can't believe it.

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:16.800
You haven't married Domenico yet,

1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:19.040
and you're already acting
like a Torricelli.

1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:22.600
Spare me the bullshit
about family loyalty.

1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:24.800
What am I supposed to do?

1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:28.880
Wait until Massimo deals with his shit
and remembers I'm his wife?

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:35.120
Who are you looking out for?
Me or yourself?

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:39.640
Just leave me alone.

1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000
I have to figure out what I really want.

1:21:51.080 --> 1:21:52.080
You're right.

1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:02.680
I'm sorry I didn't ask how you're feeling,
or if you need anything.

1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:13.040
Lari, look at me.

1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:15.960
Look at me.

1:22:20.760 --> 1:22:21.800
I love you.

1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:27.400
I want you to be happy.

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:32.720
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you. You hear me?

1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:38.320
I'm just worried.

1:22:41.800 --> 1:22:42.640
Come here.

1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:56.560
Watch out for my snot.

1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:01.320
Remember, just say the word,
and I'll fucking kill both of them.

1:23:01.840 --> 1:23:08.040
And I'll find you a nice, calm guy
from a village near Radom, okay?

1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:10.480
-That's right.

1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:11.880
What?

1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:15.080
You'll grow old and die of boredom.

1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:26.920
Honey?

1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:28.160
Hi, Dad.

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:31.560
Hi, sweetie!

1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.600
I've missed riding with you.

1:23:38.080 --> 1:23:39.920
Jesus, Laura, did something happen?

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.480
You came here on a motorcycle?

1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:45.800
You're gonna give me a heart attack.

1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:49.680
You know how much I hate your escapades.

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:51.560
Happy to see you too, Mom.

1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:56.160
Come in. I've got some pork chops.

1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:00.000
Of course, you never call ahead.

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:04.880
You could have told me you were coming.

1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.760
I would have prepared.

1:24:06.840 --> 1:24:10.280
I always have to think on my feet.

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.760
Honey, what's going on?

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:40.920
What do you mean? Nothing's going on.
I'm just here to visit you.

1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:44.480
Your mom is convinced
that people buy motorcycles

1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:47.760
when they're going through
some kind of crisis.

1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:52.720
Honey, you'll be 30 soon.

1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.000
If you were okay, you'd be spending
your birthday with your husband,

1:24:57.080 --> 1:24:59.800
celebrating the anniversary
of your first meeting.

1:24:59.880 --> 1:25:02.480
-As far as I know--
-I'm in love with someone else.

1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:13.480
Uh…

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:14.640
His name is Nacho.

1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:18.920
Honey, get me a cigarette.

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:23.560
But we agreed
that we wouldn't smoke anymore.

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:25.960
Please, bring me a cigarette!

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:30.320
All right then.

1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:25.040
Honey, if you weren't married to Massimo,
who would you choose?

1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.880
The problem is, I don't know.

1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:34.000
When you have the answer,
you'll know what to do.

1:26:38.200 --> 1:26:39.040
All right…

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.400
I'll tell you
a little secret.

1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:03.360
I think it's what's kept
our marriage alive for 35 years.

1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:11.000
Remember, a woman
must be selfish in a relationship.

1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:14.960
If you put your own happiness first,

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:18.080
you'll do whatever it takes
to make it last, right?

1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:20.840
You will cherish your relationship.

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:22.440
Mm.

1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:25.440
But it can't be
a relationship that destroys you.

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:32.160
Remember that a woman
who lives only for her man

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.440
will always be unhappy.

1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:38.080
Yeah.

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:41.200
And her man will be unhappy too.

1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:21.200
Thanks.

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:23.000
Ah, my coffee.

1:30:23.080 --> 1:30:24.800
Okay. No lid for me.

1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:27.400
Thank you very much.

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:29.920
Thanks. Bye.

1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:38.160
Coffee for Dad. And for his daughter?

1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:39.480
Mm.

1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:41.480
-Lemonade.
-Lemonade.

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:49.880
Sometimes I wish
I was still that little girl

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:51.800
you used to take out for lemonade.

1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:55.320
You'll always be my little girl.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:36.880
I like spending time with you

1:31:36.960 --> 1:31:39.720
because I can eat as much as I want
and not feel guilty.

1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:40.640
Yeah.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:42.200
It's different with Mom.

1:31:42.280 --> 1:31:43.680
-I've noticed.
-Hmm.

1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:47.640
There are two things
you never point out to a woman.

1:31:47.720 --> 1:31:48.560
What things?

1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:51.280
Her age and the amount of food she eats.

1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:53.680
I never knew about the second one.

1:31:53.760 --> 1:31:56.320
-You should.
-Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:01.600
Excuse me.

1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:07.280
-Just a second. Olga won't stop calling.
-Okay.

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:20.640
How's everything?

1:32:20.720 --> 1:32:21.920
-Good, thanks.
-Great.

1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:46.520
Hello. Answer my calls,
or I'll have a heart attack.

1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:48.400
Jeez, Olo, relax. What's up?

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:50.200
<i>You want to know what's up?</i>

1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:54.520
Massimo knows about everything, Lari.
He knows about you and Nacho!

1:32:54.600 --> 1:32:56.960
He's gonna kill you,
me, and God knows who else!

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:58.600
Um, he told you that?

1:32:59.200 --> 1:33:02.600
No, I overheard him
talking to Domenico.

1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:07.080
Um, how did you know
what they were talking about?

1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:08.400
You don't speak Italian.

1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:09.960
<i>Maybe you don't.</i>

1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:13.400
But I was pissed off
about not understanding, so I learned.

1:33:13.480 --> 1:33:17.080
Maybe I'm not a fluent speaker,
but I understand everything.

1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:19.280
You know how to say, "Nacho fucked Laura"?

1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:21.320
<i>"Nacho ha scopato Laura."</i>

1:33:23.400 --> 1:33:25.280
I guess it's time to go back to Sicily.

1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:28.680
Are you fucking insane? He knows!

1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:30.680
Shoot! Fuck knows what he's gonna do!

1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:32.960
<i>Fuck. I just said, "shoot."</i>

1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:36.720
I'd rather him shoot himself
than you or me.

1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:41.440
Olo, stop. There must be a reason
he hasn't done anything about it yet.

1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.680
Are you even listening to me?
Massimo won't forgive cheating.

1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:47.840
<i>-Listen.</i>
-Shit.

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:51.520
I'm not scared of my own husband.
I won't hide from him.

1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:55.000
I'm coming back.

1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:02.120
Do what you want.
I'm working on… an escape plan.

1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:05.280
Olo, relax. Have a cigarette, okay?

1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:08.840
What the hell do you think I'm doing?
I can't stop smoking!

1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:11.400
Okay, bye.

1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:26.200
Dad, I have to go back to Sicily.

1:34:26.760 --> 1:34:27.720
Okay.

1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:33.240
But first, let's go back to the table.
I ordered some apple pie.

1:34:34.040 --> 1:34:35.080
Come on.

1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:11.800
English, please.

1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:26.680
Mr. Fabio Rossi,

1:35:28.040 --> 1:35:31.040
what did you not understand
when I told you not to push me?

1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:37.720
Laura…

1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:44.080
by coming here, I'm risking my life
and also my father's life in business.

1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:47.920
We have a pact with Massimo
not to enter his territory.

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:49.960
And you know what?

1:35:50.760 --> 1:35:52.000
I didn't give a fuck…

1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:54.880
because I needed to see you.

1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:00.160
Bee…

1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:03.680
Please.

1:36:06.160 --> 1:36:09.080
Hear me out, and then do what you want.

1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:11.360
As you always do.

1:36:18.880 --> 1:36:21.560
Okay, Mr. Fabio Rossi. Let's go.

1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:26.600
You know the address.
You used to work there as a gardener.

1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:46.920
I've already apologized for that.

1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:49.040
I will do it again.

1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:53.040
You wanted to tell me something.

1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:56.240
Okay.

1:36:58.160 --> 1:36:59.680
I want to be honest with you.

1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:07.240
Since I met you…

1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:12.800
I understand what it means
to be best friends with your lover.

1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.040
I didn't fall in love with you
at first sight.

1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:20.680
I came to like you first.

1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:24.520
For the way you get angry…

1:37:25.840 --> 1:37:27.840
the way you squint your eyes.

1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:33.240
For being so stubborn.

1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:36.840
I love looking at you.

1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:40.800
When you sleep.

1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:44.640
When you smile
without a reason.

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:48.560
When you brush your teeth…

1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:51.360
and raise one leg.

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:54.840
I want it all, Laura.

1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:02.960
I wanna discover new things with you.
I wanna show you the sunrise in Burma.

1:38:04.040 --> 1:38:06.040
I wanna meditate with you in Bali.

1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:09.200
And get drunk with you in Tokyo.

1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:16.280
I know it sounds silly, but…

1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:22.680
I have no idea
when you became my world, Laura.

1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:24.560
I can't help it.

1:38:29.040 --> 1:38:33.520
I can't live without this world,
and I don't want to.

1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:37.080
I don't know how to convince you.

1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:40.760
I'm ready to give you everything.

1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:44.160
Whatever you want from me.

1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:56.840
Thank you for finding the courage
to tell me all of this.

1:38:58.240 --> 1:38:59.960
I know it wasn't easy.

1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:05.520
But I also need to speak with Massimo.

1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:11.360
I can't stay in that situation anymore.

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:23.320
Nacho…

1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:28.520
I need more time.

1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:50.920
I will wait.

1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:51.320
You're here!

1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:58.240
Okay. I packed just one suitcase.

1:40:58.320 --> 1:41:01.040
I grabbed your stuff too.
It'll be a quick escape.

1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.280
Why the fuck didn't you call or text?

1:41:03.360 --> 1:41:05.320
I would've sent a driver for you.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:08.280
My driver was really nice.

1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:12.200
Are you serious? Now's not the best time--

1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:13.280
Fuck.

1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:21.880
Are you fucking crazy?

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:31.800
Have you forgotten your husband's
line of work?

1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:34.120
Why don't you bring him with you,

1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:37.560
and I'll look up how to send
a dead body back to Poland?

1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:46.760
Happy birthday.

1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:54.440
God, it's so sad.
You're going to die on your birthday.

1:41:55.440 --> 1:41:57.200
Happy birthday, Lari!

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.440
If you survive,
I bought you a really nice bag.

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:03.200
If something happens, I'll keep it.

1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:04.840
-Olo…
-Yeah?

1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:05.880
Where's Massimo?

1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:10.960
He went to the beach.

1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:16.000
-Okay, I'll go find him.
-Really?

1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.360
We need to work things out.

1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:24.280
And when I get back,
we'll drink to my resurrection, okay?

1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:28.240
-I have to go now.
-Yeah.

1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:32.960
-Olo…
-Yeah?

1:42:33.560 --> 1:42:37.480
-I'm doing this alone.
-Oh yeah, alone. I'll stay here and wait.

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:46.400
Fuck…

1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:02.120
I'll just sit and wait.

1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:06.600
Lari will be okay on her own.

1:43:43.400 --> 1:43:44.640
Massimo…

1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:47.280
We need to talk.

1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:50.800
Let me start.

1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:01.800
This conversation will be
much more difficult for me.

1:44:02.320 --> 1:44:03.640
-Massimo--
-Wait.

1:44:04.240 --> 1:44:05.920
I have to say it all now.

1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:09.680
Otherwise, I'm afraid
I'm never gonna be able to say it again.

1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:15.200
That time changed my life.

1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:19.800
Not only because I had you,

1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:25.040
but also because I realized
what I really want for myself.

1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:33.640
I thought I could…

1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:42.280
I didn't want to be bad.

1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:47.200
I can't forgive myself

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:51.760
that you didn't feel to come to me anymore
after losing our baby.

1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:59.280
That you had to deal with it all alone,

1:45:00.920 --> 1:45:02.640
it has destroyed me…

1:45:03.360 --> 1:45:04.200
you…

1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:06.440
us.

1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:12.280
So you knew everything about Nacho
for a long time, didn't you?

1:45:14.480 --> 1:45:16.360
Why didn't you do anything?

1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:35.040
When I was a child,
my dad used to read me a book.

1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:43.000
I still remember one sentence,
a little parable.

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.600
I didn't really understand it back then.

1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:56.520
But now I do.

1:46:05.400 --> 1:46:07.400
"If you really love something…

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:11.640
just let it go."

1:46:15.440 --> 1:46:18.000
"If it comes back, it's yours forever."

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:22.240
"If it doesn't…

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.840
it was never meant to be."

1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:34.800
Your dad was a wonderful father.

1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.400
And you also will be, one day.

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:05.160
Are you back, baby girl?

1:52:18.480 --> 1:52:23.480
