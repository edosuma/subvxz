00:29.613 --> 00:32.824
Well, Michelle, we did it.
Happy graduation.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.875
You know,
living at my parents' house,

00:41.959 --> 00:45.003
th-that's, um...
that's a temporary thing.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.841
Uh, we've been going out
for, what, three years.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.552
You're not, like, getting bored
with things, are you?

00:51.635 --> 00:56.098
Michelle, l... I'm gonna ask you something
that I've never asked you before.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.434
Is it kinky?
I don't think so. No.

00:59.518 --> 01:04.480
You don't have to be embarrassed if you want
to add more spiciness to our relationship.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.901
Actually, um,

01:07.985 --> 01:10.779
maybe you could just, uh,
you know,

01:10.904 --> 01:12.823
use your napkin.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.785
My napkin?
Mr. Levenstein.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.328
Yes.
You have a phone call.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.123
Excuse me.
Thank you.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.918
- Hello. - Jim, it's Dad.
Uh, you left the ring at home.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.920
The box is empty.
But-But I'm on my way,

01:27.004 --> 01:29.089
and I've got the...

01:29.173 --> 01:31.758
I've got the ring, so
don't panic, son. Okay?

01:31.842 --> 01:33.719
Bye-bye.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.471
Who was that?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.308
Uh, that was my dad.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.352
That was, uh, my dad. That was, uh...
He couldn't get through on...

01:42.436 --> 01:44.479
I didn't answer my cell.
So he was, uh,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.565
getting all, uh...
was getting all worried.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.651
You know how he is. But everything is,
uh... everything is okay now.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.820
Everything is, uh...
Everything is perfectly fine.

01:51.904 --> 01:54.489
I think I know what you're gonna
ask me.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.870
And it's okay.
L... I don't have to use my napkin.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.873
- Wha...
- I've got my own techniques.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.878
Michelle, where... where are you going?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.840
Michelle? Hey. Hey.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.884
Okay.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.094
Okay, Michelle. Michelle.

02:16.220 --> 02:20.349
Okay. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Michelle.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.726
Psst!

02:22.851 --> 02:25.521
Michelle, I think you need to stop.
Okay, keep going.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.817
Oh, my God.
Michelle. Michelle.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.112
Michelle! Oh, my God.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.533
Oh, my God. Okay.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.202
Well, I made it. Where's Michelle?
The washroom?

02:40.327 --> 02:44.039
You know, I was so nervous she was
gonna spot me. Here's the ring, son.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.416
Ohh.
Let me tell you something.

02:46.542 --> 02:49.253
This is some ring.
Look at the rock on this baby.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.297
Mr. Big Spender. Hope you didn't
blow your wad on this, son.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.883
Not yet.
Your mother and I...

02:55.008 --> 02:57.553
could not be more
thrilled for you, Jim.

02:57.636 --> 03:01.390
I mean, we're so happy. And I know
you're excited. I can see it in your face.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.393
- I mean, you look like you're ready to burst.
- Uh-huh.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.479
I mean, your cheeks, they're flush.
I wish your mother could be here.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.023
Not me. That's what I wish.
You know, this is...

03:10.107 --> 03:12.860
this is one of those moments, Jim,

03:12.943 --> 03:15.237
that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.573
- Yes, it is.
- You bet it is.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.908
You bet it is.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.245
I cannot believe my son
is gonna pop the question.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.372
- What was that?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.457
Th-That?

03:27.583 --> 03:29.751
That? Knockin' on wood.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.338
And what is this, uh, popping...
popping what? What question?

03:33.463 --> 03:35.757
You are...
Oh, you're a wreck. What...

03:35.883 --> 03:37.926
You need some air.
You need some air.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.095
- Walk me to my car.
- No, I'm not walking you...

03:40.220 --> 03:43.015
- Listen to me.
This is for your own good.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.100
Oh!

03:45.225 --> 03:47.895
Your penis!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.025
Watch your penis.
I got it.

03:53.150 --> 03:55.110
Your pants.
I got the pants!

03:55.235 --> 03:57.154
I got the pants!
Please!

03:57.237 --> 03:59.364
Everybody, please.
Everybody just calm down here.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.742
Everybody, just quiet!
Lower your voice.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.705
It's disgusting!

04:10.334 --> 04:12.628
Now,

04:12.711 --> 04:15.464
I came here to do something...

04:15.589 --> 04:18.300
And, damn it, I'm...
I'm gonna do it.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.974
Michelle.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.563
Hello, dear.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.026
Michelle Anabeth Flaherty,

04:36.109 --> 04:38.529
I love you...

04:39.821 --> 04:41.990
more than I could...

04:42.115 --> 04:44.785
ever explain at this particular moment.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.500
Dad. The ring.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.045
Oh.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.343
Will you marry me?
Yes.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.690
My son.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.161
I'm the happiest man in the world.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.210
We should all be so happy.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.579
Cheers, gentlemen, sweetheart.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.583
I'm impressed.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.377
Marriage is a binding,

06:17.461 --> 06:20.547
unifying, eternal,

06:21.632 --> 06:23.926
never-ending, permanent...

06:24.009 --> 06:26.887
chaining together
of two people.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.724
Jim, have you thought this through?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.143
Yes. Yes, Finch.
Thank you.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.771
I had actually been trying to figure it
out for a while.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.607
You know, when is the right time?
Is there a right time?

06:38.732 --> 06:43.195
And finally I realized, duh, you love
the girl, marry her.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.989
Aw.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.575
Oh! Let's dance.
Dance?

06:48.700 --> 06:51.453
No.
No, you have to learn sometime.

06:51.537 --> 06:54.373
Come on!

06:54.498 --> 06:59.294
Don't laugh at me.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.090
Okay, okay.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.300
I'm just glad that's not me.

07:05.425 --> 07:10.681
Finch, you don't think there's one girl you're
destined to spend your entire life with?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.934
They're all for me, Kevin.

07:14.017 --> 07:17.646
Not, uh... Not so bad, huh?
All right.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.440
Do this.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.442
I'm sorry.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.070
Well, the wedding should be
rather entertaining.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.210
Bro, that's it?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.337
There's no keg anywhere.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.216
Jim.
Hey, John.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.510
The food and the drink
are really bad.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.512
"F" for presentation.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.390
The good news for you...
What's that?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.934
We're gonna be
ushers at the wedding.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.689
This is amazing.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.442
I don't recognize half the people in
this place.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.485
At least they all brought gifts.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.197
Hello.
Hello. I'm Mary Flaherty.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.574
Oh, hello.
Harold Flaherty.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.493
Please, please come in.
Lovely to meet you.

08:13.619 --> 08:16.246
We've been expecting you.
How was your trip?

08:16.330 --> 08:19.708
- Delightful.
- Who's excited about the wedding?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.085
Anxious might be more accurate.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.087
Oh, w-w-we've never met your son.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.089
You'll get to meet him.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.133
Rudy and Sam would like to meet him too.
Oh, yes.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.427
Better bring them in from the car.
They've been cooped up.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.471
Oh, for heaven sakes.
You brought your sons?

08:32.554 --> 08:34.806
Our dogs.
We never travel without them.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.933
Oh, my goodness.
Well, honey,

08:37.017 --> 08:40.812
why don't you go get those critters out of
the car and we'll start on some cocktails?

08:40.938 --> 08:44.983
Ah, thank you.
Right. I'll, uh, get the dogs.

08:45.108 --> 08:48.111
There's one thing that'll
make this wedding perfect.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.155
No Stifler.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.699
Well, that's one dick
we are not inviting.

08:52.783 --> 08:55.410
- Motion seconded.
- Motion carried.

08:55.536 --> 09:00.082
So, Finch, what are you gonna do
with that fancy NYU diploma?

09:00.207 --> 09:03.961
I'll frame it.
Then I'll write my memoirs.

09:04.044 --> 09:07.673
Well, you should come to law school, man.
You know I could use the company.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.968
Kids, Michelle's parents are here.
Come on. We're waiting.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.678
Oh, crumbs on the shirt.
That's bad. Okay. That's fine.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.181
I'll change. I'll change.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.185
Fuckers.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.574
Well, polish my nuts and
serve me a milk shake.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.790
What's up?

09:44.334 --> 09:46.336
That's right.

09:50.549 --> 09:53.635
Oh, cake, huh?
Hope it's good.

09:55.888 --> 10:00.017
Oh, gee. Thanks for inviting me
to the graduation party, fucker.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.734
Oh. Fuckin' right, doggy!
That's good cake!

10:08.859 --> 10:10.319
Holy shit!

10:10.402 --> 10:11.778
Hi. How are you?
Congratulations.

10:11.862 --> 10:12.154
Hey.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.328
Congratulation, jism.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.455
Excuse me. Stifler.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.415
Hey, Jim.
Stifler.

10:23.499 --> 10:25.751
- What are you doing here?
- Happy fuck day, ass mouth.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.003
Put the cake down.
Check it out. I made it myself.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.673
That's very cute. What happened to my
invite? Got lost in the mail, fuckface?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.092
I don't want to discuss this. Quiet!
Oh, quiet yourself.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.222
I think I can spell...
Seriously, man. Seriously...

10:38.305 --> 10:40.432
Jesus! Damn it, Stifler.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.768
Jim, look what you did.
Look what I did?

10:42.893 --> 10:45.521
Look at this shit.
What am I supposed to do now?

10:45.646 --> 10:48.398
Are you happy now, man?
Why are you here?

10:48.482 --> 10:51.443
My dick looks like a corn dog.
I got cake all over my balls.

10:51.527 --> 10:54.112
Jim, honey.
Shit.

10:54.196 --> 10:57.115
The Flaherty’s are waiting.
You think he's upstairs, honey?

10:57.199 --> 11:00.035
Oh, you're fucked now, Jim.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.125
Stifler, get up.

11:07.209 --> 11:10.170
This dog's great!
Is it weird that it feels good?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.590
All right.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.343
What about the dining room?
I know you'll just love him.

11:16.468 --> 11:19.388
- Jesus, Stifler.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

11:19.513 --> 11:21.890
Stop enjoying it so much.
- Lick it off!

11:22.015 --> 11:24.226
Whoo-hoo-hoo.!

11:24.351 --> 11:26.895
Son of a... You little shit.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.857
- You gotta take your pants off, man.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.487
- Jim.
- No, it's not what it looks like.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.240
- What are you doing, son? Jim.
- My dogs!

11:38.365 --> 11:41.577
Don't go in there. Lord knows what
they'll do to you. I love this dog!

11:41.702 --> 11:44.580
- I-I-I was just trying to get him off, Dad.
- That is your son?

11:44.705 --> 11:46.582
Back away from the animal.

11:46.707 --> 11:49.251
Hey, great party.
Uh, Mr. And Mrs. Flaherty, I presume.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.837
Hey, where are you going?

11:51.962 --> 11:54.590
Well, uh, lunch is, uh, served.

11:54.715 --> 11:58.510
L-I really hope that, uh...
that-that we can just...

11:58.635 --> 12:01.597
that we can all just forget about
this and-and-and move on...

12:01.722 --> 12:04.433
and start again...
start again fresh.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.979
Jim, if you hope to be the provider and
protector for our firstborn daughter,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.981
you have a long way to go.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.941
Thank you, sir.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.277
They think you're an angel...

12:15.402 --> 12:18.780
and-and I'm...
I'm just some ungrateful dog-rapist.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.409
They just think they raised
a proper, little band girl.

12:22.534 --> 12:27.748
And-And besides, sometimes it's...
it's nice to be a little more traditional.

12:27.873 --> 12:31.752
How so? How-How do you mean traditional?
I'm thinking about the wedding.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.672
Well, it's just this one day.

12:35.756 --> 12:39.343
One day where-where everyone's
eyes are on me for a change.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.929
I've just never walked into a room
and...

12:42.012 --> 12:45.057
and had everyone go,
"Ooh," and, "Ahh,"

12:45.182 --> 12:47.684
and, "Isn't she elegant?"

12:47.809 --> 12:51.647
That is exactly how our wedding is
going to be.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.607
I promise.

12:55.817 --> 12:59.696
Shit, I've got a frosted ass crack.
Hey, Finch,

12:59.780 --> 13:02.908
you want this for here
or to go?

13:02.991 --> 13:06.078
"A witty saying proves nothing."
Voltaire.

13:06.161 --> 13:09.289
"Suck my dick."
Ron Jeremy.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.377
Oh, boys.
Anybody seen the bride's parents?

13:13.502 --> 13:14.962
No? Hmm.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.172
Wait a second.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.007
Wait a second.
Come on, Stifler.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.009
This isn't a graduation party.
Time to go.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.680
Wait. Hold on.
Jim's getting married, isn't he?

13:24.763 --> 13:27.057
Holy fuckin' shit!
This is major!

13:27.182 --> 13:31.603
Do you have the slightest idea of how important
this is? We get to have a bachelor party.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.773
Yes! We celebrate the death of Jim
with a party in his honor.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.067
Chicks and boobs.
Tits and ass.

13:37.192 --> 13:40.487
Titties, ta-tas, casabas, bazoongas
all up in our friggin' faces!

13:40.571 --> 13:43.031
Buck up, fellas.
Show some enthusiasm.

13:43.115 --> 13:47.035
It's gonna be fuckin' great.
Oh, my God!

13:47.119 --> 13:50.998
Finch, he-he does make
a good point.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.083
Yeah, he does.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.547
You never heard me say that.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.550
I do not deserve
a girl this cool.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.011
Michelle said the wedding
was doable, right?

14:04.094 --> 14:06.221
A wedding.
A wedding, yeah.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.892
You know, I promised her her wedding...
you know, the wedding of her dreams.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.685
Okay.
What's the problem?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.104
Dancing. Uh, she wants...
she's gonna want to dance.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.191
You know, there's that whole tradition:
The first dance at the reception.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.902
She's gonna wanna dance
Fred Astaire kind of shit.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.237
I can't do that. I can't... She learned
all that from band camp.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.158
Okay, so you take lessons,
you know, right away.

14:26.283 --> 14:30.662
Lessons. Okay. I have to convince her
parents that I'm not a shithead.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.081
Challenging.
Indeed, challenging.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.250
But doable.
What else?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.252
What else?
I don't know what else.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.713
That's the thing.
She cares too much to tell me.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.508
She doesn't want me to worry
that she might be worried.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.510
So I'm worried.

14:44.635 --> 14:45.886
Recon.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.016
You mean, like-like spying on, uh...
like spying on Michelle?

14:51.141 --> 14:53.477
Spying is deceitful.

14:54.645 --> 14:58.232
Extra attention
means you're concerned.

14:58.315 --> 15:02.778
This is... This is true. This is good.
Guys, here's to the next step.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.781
Would you please shut up with that
stepping? Put your glass down.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.107
We'll find a wonderful place somewhere.
I promise. We'll keep looking.

15:44.486 --> 15:47.239
Is everything okay in here?
The study can get a little chilly.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.491
Do you have enough blankets?
We're fine. Thank you.

15:49.575 --> 15:52.327
L-I was kind of hoping that, uh...

15:52.452 --> 15:56.165
that someday soon
we could have a little talk.

15:56.290 --> 16:00.127
I'd really like to tell you why I think I'll
make a good husband.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.337
Whenever you get a chance.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.591
- Oh, why is that?
Come on.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.847
See, I was saying that soon...
we could talk.

16:11.972 --> 16:16.393
This... This right now is-is sort of
the preliminary talk...

16:16.518 --> 16:19.938
before the future... longer talk,

16:20.063 --> 16:24.693
which would be like a...
a quiet, uh, private dinner talk.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.196
Let him finish.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.158
I'm talking to you.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.161
Shh.
- Okay.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.790
Good talking to you.

16:42.586 --> 16:46.298
No. No, these aren't
gonna work.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.551
Wow.

16:49.635 --> 16:54.056
You guys in a sporting goods store.
Very good.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.309
Hey, Finch,
I think they got your size.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.311
Aw, beautiful.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.563
Jim needs to learn
to dance for his wedding.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.148
You know, I think he's screwed.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.069
Of course he's screwed.
He's getting married.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.070
I can't wait to see this disaster.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.906
What makes you think
you're invited?

17:18.288 --> 17:21.708
I already called up Jim's mom,
got the info.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.710
I'm preparing
for the festivities.

17:23.794 --> 17:27.923
It's time for me to boom-boom with
the bridesmaids, Finch-fucker.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.926
'Cause I'm gonna hang out
with my wang out.

17:32.803 --> 17:35.681
And I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out!

17:35.806 --> 17:39.226
Ooh, yep, that's
what I'm talking about.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.603
All right, Stifler. Um,

17:41.687 --> 17:44.106
this-this is a little, uh,
difficult to explain.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.025
Look, you're... you're okay.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.945
You're okay.
L-l-I mean, uh... I mean, I like you.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.948
Yeah, great.
You can blow me after practice.

17:53.031 --> 17:55.117
I'm working, dude.
Well, dude...

17:55.242 --> 17:58.954
- Come on. Work it! Hustle!

17:59.079 --> 18:02.416
See, my mom didn't know that there
was a misunderstanding. Push it! Move it!

18:02.499 --> 18:05.085
- You're not invited!
- Hold!

18:08.672 --> 18:11.300
Dude, how the hell do you even
think you're getting married?

18:11.425 --> 18:14.803
I've been looking out for your sex
life since high school. You what?

18:14.887 --> 18:17.681
Ohhhh! Ohh!

18:19.850 --> 18:22.102
The first tits
this guy ever saw...

18:22.186 --> 18:23.979
were because of me.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.607
The first girl he ever hooked up with...

18:26.690 --> 18:29.193
was at my party at my cottage.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.778
That girl is the girl he's marrying.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.489
The Stif-man showed him the way.

18:34.573 --> 18:37.951
- Can I get a "Hallelujah"?
- Hallelujah, Stifler!

18:38.035 --> 18:40.162
But, my fuckers,

18:40.287 --> 18:43.290
this mofo right here does not want
the Stif-meister,

18:43.373 --> 18:45.918
the grand, fucking facilitator
to attend the wedding.

18:46.043 --> 18:49.338
Who sucks donkey dick?
Jim sucks donkey dick!

18:49.463 --> 18:52.633
Jim sucks donkey dick!
The answer's no. Okay? I'm sorry.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.635
The answer's no.
I can dance.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.679
What?
I can dance.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.682
Jim sucks donkey dick!
Jim sucks donkey dick!

19:00.807 --> 19:03.393
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.149
Okay. Now-Now what
exactly is this here?

19:09.233 --> 19:12.319
Left box turn.
Left box turn.

19:12.402 --> 19:15.405
Hi. Stop looking into
my eyes. Sorry. Sorry.

19:15.489 --> 19:17.491
How do you...
How do you know how to do this?

19:17.574 --> 19:19.993
My mom made me take it for three fucking years.
Yeah?

19:20.077 --> 19:22.621
Yeah, I hated it.
No, you're really good.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.207
Uh, you should take ballet
or something.

19:25.290 --> 19:29.127
Fuckface! What part of "This sucks my ass"
do you not under-fuckin'-stand?

19:29.253 --> 19:32.714
This is exactly what I'm talking about,
Steven. You can't behave like this.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.176
L-l-lf you want to come to the wedding,
I'm sorry, you cannot act like this.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.178
Are you saying
I'm impolite or something?

19:38.262 --> 19:40.681
Impolite would be
an improvement. Look,

19:40.764 --> 19:44.142
just... just try not to be,
uh, you know, uh,

19:44.268 --> 19:46.228
you.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.898
Fuck this shit.
It's not worth it.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.109
Hey, wait, Stifler.
Stifler, hold on.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.404
Wait. Okay. Wh-What if, uh... What if you,
uh, plan the bachelor party?

19:55.529 --> 19:58.907
With a dildo show?
Sure.

19:58.991 --> 20:01.910
Look. Just... If you can find the time,
uh, to fit it in,

20:01.994 --> 20:03.787
go ahead, surprise me.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.998
Sorry, chief. That only
gets you halfway there.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.457
Why? Why ha...
What do you mean?

20:07.583 --> 20:10.627
I need assurances that I'm gonna get
some quality action at this wedding.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.629
I'm sor... I can't...
I can't make that promise.

20:12.754 --> 20:15.257
Well, let me put it to you
this way, Jimbo.

20:15.382 --> 20:19.428
No pussy, no dancing. Okay?

20:19.553 --> 20:24.850
No pussy, no dancing.
How's that for polite?

20:29.646 --> 20:32.232
Jim, your suspicions
are confirmed.

20:32.316 --> 20:34.776
Michelle wants a dress
that she can't get.

20:34.860 --> 20:38.906
The dress she wants is Amsale.
They have a store in Chicago.

20:38.989 --> 20:41.158
Now, if we leave right now,

20:41.283 --> 20:43.035
we can get there by the time they close...
a three-hour drive.

20:44.745 --> 20:46.580
A three-hour drive?
Kick fuckin'ass.

20:46.705 --> 20:49.124
Are we going to Chicago
to see titties?

20:49.249 --> 20:52.544
We are talking about getting Michelle
a dress in Chicago.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.671
Now, please, vanish.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.090
Hey, Finch, what's the capital
of Thailand?

20:57.216 --> 20:59.092
Bangkok!

21:00.719 --> 21:02.888
Dude...
Hey, I got shotgun.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.271
Let's get this dress shit over with.

21:11.396 --> 21:14.024
The strip bar has got
free hot wings before 7:00.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.569
Now, Jim, let me handle this.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.863
These are my people.
They're gay?

21:19.947 --> 21:23.534
No, you bleeding imbecile.
They have style. They're cultured.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.870
- They're sophisticated.
- So they're gay.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.873
So, mademoiselle,
I'm sure that you can appreciate...

21:29.957 --> 21:33.669
that monsieur here is stuck right between
Scylla and Charybdis.

21:33.794 --> 21:36.713
Yes, I'm afraid he's no Ulysses.

21:36.797 --> 21:40.467
- Okay, what's happening here?
- You need to speak to my dressmaker.

21:40.592 --> 21:44.888
That's who would actually make the dress.
And I'm afraid Leslie has gone for the day.

21:54.982 --> 21:58.318
All right. She-She said she'd probably be
at one of these bars here on Halstead.

21:58.443 --> 22:01.113
I say we split up and ask around
for a Leslie Summers.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.115
Right.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.716
Hey there, sweet little thing.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.760
Hey there, you sweet manly thing.

22:23.844 --> 22:26.305
You know, I really love your shirt.
Do I know you?

22:26.430 --> 22:29.308
I'm Jennifer.
Well, Jennifer,

22:29.391 --> 22:32.019
just relax, take it slow...

22:32.144 --> 22:34.021
and let the good times roll.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.982
'Cause Daddy's a regular here.
Do you want to get a drink?

22:37.065 --> 22:39.359
You're goddamn right I do.
Whoo-hoo!

22:40.569 --> 22:43.488
Whoo. Two cold ones.

22:43.614 --> 22:47.117
Hey, you know, my friend would really
dig your vibe. Will you wait here?

22:47.242 --> 22:49.495
Sure thing, babe.
Good.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.497
All right.

22:51.622 --> 22:53.540
How you feeling, sexy?
Pretty good.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.834
Whoa. You have a deep voice.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.378
That's not all.

22:58.504 --> 23:00.380
Oh, right.

23:00.506 --> 23:03.133
You look really cute tonight.
Thanks.

23:03.217 --> 23:06.136
I guess. What the...

23:08.514 --> 23:10.807
Oh, hey.
Gettin' a little frisky.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.477
Oh. Game over.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.896
What's happening here?

23:18.482 --> 23:20.359
Hey. Any luck?

23:20.484 --> 23:23.320
- Not so much.
- All right. Let's, uh...

23:26.490 --> 23:28.951
This is Bear.

23:29.076 --> 23:31.537
Hey.
Wow. You are a bear.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.667
- Yeah.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.710
How much you bench?

23:38.794 --> 23:41.338
- How much you weigh?
- Why?

23:41.463 --> 23:43.549
You wanna try
and pick me up?

23:43.674 --> 23:45.843
Yeah, I think I could.

23:45.926 --> 23:48.262
Yeah, I bet you could.
You are big.

23:48.387 --> 23:50.597
I could use
a guy like you on my team.

23:50.722 --> 23:55.519
Are you... Are you talking about
our team or an actual team?

23:55.602 --> 23:58.021
What the hell is "our team"?

23:58.105 --> 24:00.023
Hi. Where's the girl?

24:00.107 --> 24:02.025
What the fuck
are we talking about?

24:02.109 --> 24:04.862
You need to take
another look around.

24:10.033 --> 24:13.912
- Hey, honey.! - Oh, my God.
What the fuck is going on?

24:16.707 --> 24:19.543
- Come on.
Is that all you got?

24:19.626 --> 24:22.588
Pussy!

24:22.671 --> 24:25.215
I, uh... I must have came
to the wrong place. Stifler.

24:25.299 --> 24:27.426
Stifler.
Oh, man.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.595
Hey.
Oh, it's so good to see you.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.097
L... How did you get up the nerve
to check out a gay bar?

24:32.222 --> 24:35.058
Yeah. Really don't wanna talk about it
right now. I just wanna go home.

24:35.142 --> 24:37.227
- Your friend here was just leaving.
- Eat shit.

24:37.352 --> 24:39.980
Did you find Leslie?
Fuck your stupid dressmaker, man.

24:40.105 --> 24:43.567
- You guys know Leslie Summers?
- Uh, we're trying to find her.

24:45.277 --> 24:48.363
You know what? I think you guys are
out of luck. Why don't you go home?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.782
No. Y-You know Leslie... He knows Leslie S...
Okay, look.

24:50.908 --> 24:53.660
My friends and I just drove
all the way from Michigan...

24:53.785 --> 24:56.455
to find my fiancée the wedding dress
that she deserves.

24:56.580 --> 25:00.167
Now, we need Leslie to make it for us.
Can-Can you please help us find her?

25:00.334 --> 25:03.754
I'm sure Leslie always helps
associates of assholes.

25:05.464 --> 25:08.175
What are you looking at?
I'm not a steak.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.095
Listen, breeder, not every gay man
wants to have sex with you.

25:12.179 --> 25:15.015
Oh, yeah?
Listen up, ass jockey.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.518
If I were gay, you'd want me.
Really.

25:17.643 --> 25:19.978
Really. I got style.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.814
I'm cultured.
I'm sophisticated.

25:22.940 --> 25:27.152
And all that just radiates
from your oh, so sexy self.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.154
That's bullshit.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.281
Everyone wants a piece of the
Stif-meister.

25:34.827 --> 25:37.579
Right! Yeah!

25:38.622 --> 25:40.833
Without a doubt!

25:40.958 --> 25:42.876
- I'll show you fuckers.
- Bye.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.837
Everybody say, "Bye. '"Bye.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.464
Bye.

25:47.548 --> 25:50.676
Bye.
Good luck with the dress.

25:53.637 --> 25:55.597
Give us a drink.

26:25.878 --> 26:28.630
Mother of God.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.566
Bitch!

26:54.990 --> 26:58.535
Whoo-hoo.!

26:58.660 --> 27:01.205
What is this, a dance-off?

27:03.790 --> 27:05.375
Oh, yeah?

27:42.871 --> 27:45.332
Go, big boy.!

28:35.841 --> 28:37.718
I love you!

28:37.843 --> 28:39.761
What?

28:39.845 --> 28:42.431
Fabulous. Seeing that
was worth anything.

28:42.514 --> 28:45.475
Look, I'm Leslie Summers,
and you've got yourself a dress.

28:47.269 --> 28:49.313
Thank you. Oh, my God.
Thank you.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.857
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

28:51.982 --> 28:55.652
Yeah, no problem.
Hey, who's your friend? Uh, K-Kevin.

29:00.866 --> 29:02.993
Was that the best night
ever or what? Stifler,

29:03.118 --> 29:05.287
are you... are you kidding me?
It was amazing.

29:05.370 --> 29:08.373
Hey, guys!
Hey, hey.

29:08.457 --> 29:12.503
Hey, when you get your bachelor party
together, I manage some girls in town.

29:12.586 --> 29:15.589
Real ones.
All right.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.760
Call me. Damn, Stiffy,
you got some moves.

29:27.017 --> 29:31.021
Told you that guy
wanted to fuck me.

29:31.146 --> 29:34.316
I can't believe this. They're really
gonna make the dress for me?

29:34.399 --> 29:38.278
They are expecting your call.
Go ahead. This is so cool. Oh.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.489
I love you.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.574
Thank you.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.997
Well, that worked out.

29:49.081 --> 29:52.501
Well, maybe it's time we have
that special dinner chat.

29:52.584 --> 29:54.628
I'll have turkey.

29:59.091 --> 30:00.968
Thanks for helping out.

30:01.093 --> 30:03.762
We're so close, and there's still so
much to do.

30:06.431 --> 30:07.891
Cadence!

30:19.194 --> 30:22.614
Hey.
Hi.

30:22.698 --> 30:26.451
Cadence, this is Paul Finch. Finch,
meet my younger sister, Cadence.

30:26.577 --> 30:29.246
Nice to meet you.
You're reading Descartes.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.248
Yep.

30:31.331 --> 30:34.501
Cogito ergo sum.
"I think, therefore I am."

30:34.626 --> 30:37.796
Hungry.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.799
Hungry.

30:40.924 --> 30:43.093
So, when's Mark getting in?

30:43.177 --> 30:46.638
Uh, let's see,
that would be never.

30:46.763 --> 30:49.558
Did you guys break up?
How tragic.

30:49.641 --> 30:51.852
Uh, sorry, Paul Finch.
Girl stuff.

30:58.734 --> 31:03.155
Just stay calm. I'm available,
she's available. It's all good.

31:04.364 --> 31:07.409
She's a beautiful girl,
and you're you.

31:08.869 --> 31:11.330
I dumped him.

31:11.413 --> 31:15.292
But it was Mark. I thought
you really liked him. He was nice.

31:15.375 --> 31:20.172
Yeah, but sometimes nice isn't so nice.

31:20.297 --> 31:22.299
W-Wait. Hold on.
Let me get this straight.

31:22.424 --> 31:25.802
He didn't want to do it. He said he
didn't want to ruin what we had...

31:25.886 --> 31:27.804
by deflowering ourselves.

31:27.888 --> 31:29.806
Who the hell uses
the word deflower?

31:31.850 --> 31:35.229
That's like something Mom would say.
Yeah.

31:35.354 --> 31:38.524
And I'm starting to realize that Mom and
Dad's idea of appropriate behaviour...

31:38.649 --> 31:40.567
might be a little bit different than mine.

31:41.902 --> 31:43.821
Mitch, you're in love.
Shh.

31:43.904 --> 31:46.031
You're getting married.
I mean, what's this like?

31:46.156 --> 31:49.701
It's like it's...
I'm never gonna be able to explain it.

31:49.827 --> 31:54.331
I wanted us to write our own vows for
the wedding, and now I can't do mine.

31:54.456 --> 31:56.750
L... How do you explain love?

31:56.875 --> 31:59.753
Uh, l-I guess
I wouldn't know.

31:59.878 --> 32:03.048
I don't think I've ever
felt that way about a guy.

32:03.131 --> 32:06.134
Oh, someday you will.
Maybe.

32:06.218 --> 32:09.888
But in the meantime, I don't think it would
hurt to get a little rowdy this weekend.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.224
Jim's got single friends,
right? Yes.

32:12.307 --> 32:15.769
- Think Finch is a possibility?
- Oh, Finch is boneable.

32:15.894 --> 32:18.605
Yes, he is boneable.

32:22.067 --> 32:26.113
Dickhead. You do not send shit
to my office at school.

32:26.238 --> 32:28.782
Hey, Stifler. Why don't you come in
and make yourself comfortable?

32:28.907 --> 32:31.910
Your letter made a great impression on
Coach Marshall when he read it.

32:32.035 --> 32:34.288
Let me just refresh your memory,
partner. "Dear Steve,

32:34.413 --> 32:38.250
I will be forever in your debt if you teach
me to dance like you did in the gay bar."

32:38.375 --> 32:40.252
I put serious thought
into that letter.

32:40.377 --> 32:44.214
"Don't push me 'cause I'm
close to the edge.

32:44.298 --> 32:47.759
I'm trying not to
lose my head." Uh-huh.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.803
Uh-huh.

32:51.471 --> 32:54.391
These are really nice. I mean,
for a bridesmaid dress.

32:54.474 --> 32:56.935
- At least something you can actually
wear again. - Wear again.

32:57.019 --> 33:00.314
But you don't think
it's too sexy, do you?

33:00.439 --> 33:04.151
I mean, I don't want to seem slutty or anything.
I'm trying to attract a decent guy here.

33:04.276 --> 33:08.071
It's a wedding.
They'll all be decent guys.

33:08.155 --> 33:11.116
I just don't feel quite like a virgin in it.

33:11.241 --> 33:13.118
Oh!

33:15.787 --> 33:18.999
So, you guys have to be psyched
to be done with college.

33:19.124 --> 33:22.461
I mean, I swear, I'm running out of
room in my brain for everything.

33:22.586 --> 33:25.130
There's always room for
Plato and Aristotle.

33:25.255 --> 33:28.258
Some of my favourites.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.428
Excuse me, guys.

33:31.553 --> 33:34.515
Finch,
she thinks you were being sarcastic.

33:34.640 --> 33:38.310
Okay. It's so good to see you.

33:38.435 --> 33:41.313
You want some help? Here. Let me...
Let me help you out there.

33:41.438 --> 33:44.942
There you go. Okay.
You keep fighting the good fight, sir.

33:47.152 --> 33:49.071
It's great.

33:49.154 --> 33:51.114
That was really sweet of you.

33:51.198 --> 33:54.284
Yeah. I love old people.

33:56.119 --> 33:59.081
Hey, I hate to be nosy
and impolite, but, um,

33:59.164 --> 34:02.042
do you know Jim Levenstein and
Michelle Flaherty? Yeah.

34:02.167 --> 34:04.628
Are they here?
Well, I'm Cadence, Michelle's sister.

34:04.711 --> 34:07.798
I had no idea.
I'm their good friend Steven.

34:07.881 --> 34:10.342
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

34:10.425 --> 34:13.178
Well, they're around town doing
some wedding stuff. That's cool.

34:13.303 --> 34:16.514
But there's still a few of us in the
other room if you want to join us.

34:16.639 --> 34:21.353
I don't know. I mean, you look so nice,
I feel underdressed.

34:22.646 --> 34:25.649
Well, I think you look great.
Thank you.

34:25.732 --> 34:29.235
Oh, here they are.
Hi, boys. Don't stand up.

34:30.529 --> 34:33.239
- The dads aren't here yet?
- I'll go find him.

34:33.364 --> 34:35.868
Now, which one of you
is the best man?

34:35.993 --> 34:39.996
Jim didn't pick just one.
Or I mean, he-he couldn't decide.

34:40.080 --> 34:43.708
- Hey, Paul. Hey, Kevin.
- Mom, I want you to meet Steven.

34:43.833 --> 34:48.297
He's friends of Jim’s and mine and,
oh, everyone's.

34:48.380 --> 34:50.549
You look very familiar,
Steven.

34:50.674 --> 34:53.051
Really? Oh, I'm afraid
we've never met. Oh.

34:53.135 --> 34:55.262
Oh. Well, we have now.

34:55.387 --> 34:58.682
Oh, looks like you found
Samantha's Sweets.

34:58.765 --> 35:01.768
Oh, yes.
Isn't their chocolate just to die for?

35:01.894 --> 35:04.396
- Oh, well, you have no idea.
- Actually, I do.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.899
I love chocolate more than life itself.
More than life itself.

35:07.024 --> 35:09.401
Yes.! I was just saying
to your friends that...

35:09.484 --> 35:12.529
I have something
very precious here.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.781
What is it?

35:14.907 --> 35:18.452
Michelle's grandmother's...
my mother's... wedding ring.

35:18.577 --> 35:20.746
Isn't that precious?

35:20.871 --> 35:23.582
But since all of you
are the best man,

35:23.665 --> 35:25.584
I don't know who should
ho-hold onto it.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.711
- I think it's best if l...
- Oh, um...

35:28.754 --> 35:32.257
I think you should get to know us first
and then decide.

35:33.425 --> 35:36.261
You are such a gentleman, Steve.

35:36.386 --> 35:39.556
I hear that all the time, but it never gets old.
Aw.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.850
Hey, Paul, uh, do you have a camera?

35:41.934 --> 35:44.770
How thoughtful.

35:44.895 --> 35:48.106
I must have forgotten
my camera at home, Steven.

35:48.232 --> 35:50.609
Oh, m-maybe you could take,
like, a mental note.

35:50.692 --> 35:53.946
- I won't forget this moment.

35:54.029 --> 35:56.323
I bet you won't.
Would you care to join us?

35:56.448 --> 35:58.450
I would love to.
Thank you. Well, come on.

35:58.575 --> 36:01.620
Lovely to see you fellas.
Thank you.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.919
Oh, amazing.

36:09.002 --> 36:11.171
What the hell is he doing
near my flowers?

36:11.296 --> 36:13.799
I love the way the tulips
accentuate the, um...

36:13.924 --> 36:16.760
- What do you call those again, sir?
- Double Lisianthus.

36:16.844 --> 36:19.805
Lisianthus.
Double "Lisianthums."

36:19.888 --> 36:22.140
What a pretty name.

36:24.977 --> 36:28.272
I told him to be nice,
or-or he couldn't come to the wedding.

36:28.355 --> 36:31.692
I will take care of this. I will take care of this.
Hey. Hey, James.

36:31.817 --> 36:34.111
Oh, great. Come on over.
Oh, great. Come on over.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.488
See if I forgot anything.
I don't think... Oh. Oh, oh.

36:36.572 --> 36:38.991
We're having a great time.
I think I've got it all.

36:39.074 --> 36:40.993
Oh, look, look, look, look.

36:41.118 --> 36:43.495
- Sahara and Desert Rose...

36:43.620 --> 36:45.831
for your bridesmaids' bouquet.

36:45.956 --> 36:48.667
Oh, give me that.
Smell this.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.669
It's fantastic.
Fantastic.

36:50.794 --> 36:53.463
And, oh... Oh. Oh!

36:53.547 --> 36:55.465
Oh, oh, oh!

36:55.549 --> 36:59.386
Look at this.

36:59.511 --> 37:03.348
Oh, boy. Let's go look at
the candelabrum, honey.

37:03.473 --> 37:05.684
I think with the Summer Blossoms.
Mm-hmm.

37:05.767 --> 37:07.686
Cutie.
Thank you for everything.

37:07.769 --> 37:10.397
What do you think, girls?
Isn't this adorable? Bye, Cadence.

37:10.522 --> 37:13.692
Okay, I know... I know what you're doing.
Look. Have you seen yourself?

37:13.775 --> 37:16.904
I can't believe you're doing this.
Just calm down, dude.

37:17.029 --> 37:18.906
It's all set.
What's set?

37:19.031 --> 37:22.451
I'm gonna teach you to dance
like a "Baryshiniankov."

37:22.534 --> 37:24.995
Oh, yeah.
He is pretty good.

37:25.078 --> 37:28.499
Jim, he's not doing it to be nice.
He's doing it to bone Cadence.

37:28.582 --> 37:31.793
Look, maybe we should give him a chance.
You know, I think... I think...

37:31.877 --> 37:35.339
that underneath all the fucks
and shits and blow mes,

37:35.464 --> 37:39.551
there's a very sensitive person
who is just thirsty for acceptance.

37:39.676 --> 37:41.678
That's-That's what I think.

37:41.762 --> 37:46.350
Oh, Jim, you've gotta stop masturbating.
It's melting your brain.

37:46.475 --> 37:49.228
Observe the fuckin' Stif-meister.

37:49.311 --> 37:51.230
What is his defining characteristic?

37:52.814 --> 37:54.775
He uses the F-word excessively.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.819
Thanks, man.

37:56.902 --> 38:00.030
But I also have confidence.
You're one big floppy cock.

38:00.155 --> 38:02.282
Look at you.
You've gotta stand like a man.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.785
Your posture tells your partner
where to go.

38:04.910 --> 38:06.954
Okay. Okay.
Okay?

38:07.079 --> 38:09.039
Follow my lead.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.544
This is the waltz.
Waltz. Okay.

38:13.627 --> 38:16.088
Waltz. Okay.

38:18.298 --> 38:21.051
That's pretty good.
You're fuckin' right it's good.

38:21.134 --> 38:23.595
I'm gonna save your ass
in this wedding.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.139
Pretty soon you're gonna
want me to shave your balls.

38:26.265 --> 38:29.434
Should I shave my balls? Do you shave
your balls? How do you do it?

38:29.560 --> 38:31.603
Dude, no.

38:33.105 --> 38:35.440
L... l... I'm just...

38:35.566 --> 38:37.484
Shaving.

38:37.651 --> 38:40.529
You know, there's nothing like
a local pub.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.531
Mm-hmm.
It's like real America...

38:42.614 --> 38:46.243
without all that corporateness and catchy jingles.
Well, what's wrong with a good jingle?

38:46.326 --> 38:48.954
I think it was Voltaire who said,

38:50.455 --> 38:54.251
"A jingle witty proves everything
for my friends and I."

38:56.086 --> 38:58.964
- Cadence.

38:59.047 --> 39:00.966
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

39:01.049 --> 39:03.302
You're just in time
for Voltaire's greatest hits.

39:03.427 --> 39:06.638
Voltaire?
Stifler, please, who was Voltaire?

39:06.722 --> 39:08.640
Someone much wiser than you,
I'm afraid, Finch.

39:09.725 --> 39:13.145
Actually, I'm getting a little burned out
on all the intellectual stuff.

39:13.228 --> 39:15.147
Yeah. Me too.

39:15.230 --> 39:19.151
Being smart is so hard.

39:21.236 --> 39:23.489
I'll give you some intelligence.

39:24.781 --> 39:27.367
Voltaire can suck on my balls.

39:29.161 --> 39:30.704
What?

39:30.829 --> 39:33.290
It's about time somebody
finally came out and said it.

39:33.415 --> 39:35.542
Hey, I'm gonna give you a quote to live by.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.544
"Love life, get paid and then get laid."

39:37.669 --> 39:41.131
That is the basic philosophy
of the Finch-meister.

39:41.256 --> 39:42.508
I like that.

39:42.633 --> 39:45.969
- Bet you do.
- But I don't know why you do...

39:46.053 --> 39:49.306
because Finch-meister doesn't
make any friggin' sense.

39:49.389 --> 39:52.351
- Sure, it does.
- No fuckin' shit it does.

39:54.937 --> 39:58.315
Cadence, let's leave
the "crayton" here, shall we?

39:58.398 --> 40:00.567
Whatever. Fuck it.
I'm walkin' anyway.

40:00.692 --> 40:04.696
Wait. You know, actually, I think I'm gonna
go stretch my legs with the Finch-meister.

40:04.822 --> 40:07.366
- You don't mind, do you, Steven?
- No.

40:09.660 --> 40:11.537
Ha!

40:16.208 --> 40:19.086
It's on like Donkey Kong, bi-i-itch.

40:19.211 --> 40:21.088
Pack it up, bitch.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.090
I'm on it. Thank you.

40:23.215 --> 40:26.343
So, uh, Cadence say
anything about me?

40:26.426 --> 40:29.555
Whatever you and Finch are pulling,
she seems to like you both.

40:29.680 --> 40:33.267
Finch. Is she gonna be
around tomorrow night?

40:33.392 --> 40:36.520
No, she's going up to Chicago
with Michelle for the final dress fitting.

40:36.603 --> 40:39.898
What about her parents?
I think her mom kind of likes me.

40:39.982 --> 40:43.026
They're going up north with,
uh... with my parents...

40:43.110 --> 40:46.071
for, uh... you know, to get things, uh,
ready for the rehearsal.

40:46.196 --> 40:48.574
So, uh...
So that's where they'll be.

40:48.657 --> 40:51.076
So don't bother looking for them or anything,
you know.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.370
A wedding.

40:53.453 --> 40:57.124
Shit. How do you know
she's the right girl?

40:57.249 --> 40:59.209
I just do.

40:59.293 --> 41:02.921
I'm a better person when I'm with Michelle.
Nobody else can... No, no, no, shithead.

41:03.046 --> 41:06.633
You hooked up with one other girl for,
what, 10 seconds.

41:06.758 --> 41:10.137
Not to mention you passed on Nadia.
Dumbest fuckin' thing ever.

41:10.262 --> 41:12.764
You're like a blind man picking
out his favourite porno.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.808
This shit is crazy.

41:17.936 --> 41:20.606
This is just the old pre-wedding jitters,
son.

41:20.731 --> 41:23.317
It's so forever, you know. It-It's, uh...

41:23.442 --> 41:25.819
You know, Michelle is the only, uh,

41:25.944 --> 41:27.821
girl that I've... I've been with.

41:27.946 --> 41:31.742
Honestly, now... Honestly, would you
have passed up sex with Nadia?

41:33.160 --> 41:36.121
Why? Did she say something?

41:36.246 --> 41:38.624
Hypothetically, Dad.
Oh, hypothetically.

41:38.749 --> 41:41.251
Well, I mean, you know,
Jim, I'm a married man.

41:41.376 --> 41:43.670
I'm...
If-lf-lf you weren't married.

41:43.795 --> 41:46.798
She's a college girl.
If you were a college guy.

41:46.924 --> 41:49.510
In a heartbeat.
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

41:49.635 --> 41:54.473
First of all, what-what you're feeling is
so normal and perfectly natural.

41:54.598 --> 41:59.478
Marriage is not about, uh, animal lusting
and-and kinky sex games.

41:59.561 --> 42:04.149
It's not so much about who's the dog
and who's the fire hydrant tonight.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.151
It's-It's deeper than that.

42:06.276 --> 42:09.154
The longer a marriage lasts,

42:09.279 --> 42:11.156
uh, the longer you can go,

42:11.281 --> 42:13.158
uh, without sex.

42:13.283 --> 42:16.703
But when that magic night
does happen, uh,

42:16.829 --> 42:18.705
it's-it's all the more meaningful.

42:18.831 --> 42:20.833
And let me tell you,
your mother, bless her,

42:20.958 --> 42:23.043
can still make me, uh,
squeal like a pig.

42:23.168 --> 42:26.630
Uh, and I mean that in the good sense, son.
Do you follow what I'm saying?

42:26.755 --> 42:29.299
You understand where I'm going?
I do. I, uh... I think I, uh...

42:29.383 --> 42:33.136
Anything else you need?
No. No, that's, uh...

42:34.221 --> 42:36.139
Anything I can do.

42:55.242 --> 42:58.871
He's not here. Park the cars down
there where he won't see them.

43:05.586 --> 43:08.714
Hoo! Fuckin' right!

43:09.840 --> 43:13.093
So, you like my pants, Stiffy? Whatever,
dude. As long as the girls are worth it.

43:13.218 --> 43:16.930
They're worth it. Oh, and if you've got some
good wine too, that'll score some points for you.

43:17.055 --> 43:19.892
- We think there's some in the...
in the basement. - I'll get it.

43:19.975 --> 43:21.894
You ain't gonna want to miss this.

43:21.977 --> 43:24.688
Gentlemen.

43:24.771 --> 43:26.106
Gentlemen, I would like to introduce...

43:27.524 --> 43:31.653
Officer Krystal und Fräulein Brandi.

43:33.071 --> 43:35.032
Oh, my God.

43:35.157 --> 43:38.744
Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Yeah.!

43:38.827 --> 43:42.915
- Oh, my God!
- You boys have been very messy.

43:47.419 --> 43:49.546
Whoops.
Can you see my fanny?

43:49.671 --> 43:51.798
Whoops.

43:51.882 --> 43:53.717
Ohh!

43:55.344 --> 43:56.720
Whoo.!

43:56.845 --> 43:58.597
- Oh!

43:59.848 --> 44:02.851
- You naughty girl.

44:04.686 --> 44:07.898
None of that pleading the Fifth crap!

44:08.023 --> 44:10.442
- You boys are gonna talk.
- Uh... Uh...

44:10.526 --> 44:12.110
Wow.!

44:14.238 --> 44:16.031
Oh, my God!

44:16.156 --> 44:18.951
Are you just gonna stand there and drool?

44:19.034 --> 44:22.037
- Or are we gonna have a bachelor party?
- Fuck yeah, we are!

44:22.162 --> 44:24.915
Yeah? What?
I can't hear you.

44:25.040 --> 44:29.086
Louder!
Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes. Bachelor party.

44:29.211 --> 44:30.671
Can't hear you.
Louder! Louder!

44:30.754 --> 44:34.258
- Stick a finger in my ass!

44:36.552 --> 44:39.012
- That's weird.
- You just wait.

44:39.096 --> 44:41.974
Look, maybe we should
just wait for... Jim.

44:42.057 --> 44:45.394
- Fuck Jim, man! This is for us.
- Take her top off.

44:45.519 --> 44:48.939
My girlfriend has strict rules
about this. No touching.

44:49.064 --> 44:51.942
What are you, a dancing clown?

44:52.067 --> 44:55.654
You wipe that shit-eating grin off
your face, you punk-ass little bitch.

44:55.737 --> 44:58.031
- This is awesome!
Oh, you like that?

44:58.115 --> 44:59.825
You like it, huh?
How much? Boob.

44:59.908 --> 45:01.994
No! Hmph!

45:02.077 --> 45:06.498
I'm sorry. No, not yet.
But you will be.

45:06.582 --> 45:09.668
Like I said, this is awesome.

45:17.217 --> 45:21.972
Hey, listen, l-l-l-I think we both know
that Officer Krystal and me have this...

45:23.098 --> 45:25.058
You know. Yeah.
Thing? Mm-hmm.

45:32.441 --> 45:35.694
No one has ever
slapped my ass like that.

45:35.777 --> 45:39.239
No one's ever pinched
my nipple with such ferocity.

45:45.078 --> 45:49.082
l... I'm a master
of the Tantric art.

45:49.208 --> 45:51.293
L-I look at her body...

45:51.418 --> 45:55.047
and I just see the chakras and
the things I can do to her and...

45:55.130 --> 45:57.090
Ohh!

46:05.849 --> 46:10.270
You. You look cute.
L... Oh, thank you.

46:10.354 --> 46:12.314
Thank you, but you...
you're the cute one.

46:12.439 --> 46:15.275
Stiffy! How slimming
is this, huh?

46:15.359 --> 46:18.111
What the fuck,
Buffalo Bill?

46:18.195 --> 46:21.323
What, this... What,
the pink too much?

46:21.448 --> 46:25.536
It puts the dress in the drawer
and it does as it's told.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.456
Oh, dude.
Now that's fucked up.

46:29.581 --> 46:31.625
That's fucked up.

46:31.708 --> 46:34.711
And in closing, you have been
a naughty, naughty girl.

46:34.837 --> 46:37.756
You been naughty, Brandi?
You been fuckin' naughty?

46:37.840 --> 46:41.343
Fresh.

46:41.468 --> 46:44.388
Take her top off!

46:44.513 --> 46:48.684
You didn't get to cleaning,
little bitch fucker? Huh? Ow!

46:50.227 --> 46:52.229
Wanna see us kiss?

46:54.773 --> 46:56.733
Fuck, no.
No, no.

46:56.859 --> 46:58.819
None of that
"you go, we go" bullshit.

46:58.902 --> 47:01.155
Already done that.
Very good of you.

47:13.208 --> 47:16.086
I used to have this pet bass.
Oh.

47:16.211 --> 47:18.672
His name was Arnie, and...
Oh, he was so cute.

47:18.755 --> 47:20.674
And he just loved me too.
Yeah.

47:20.757 --> 47:22.968
He'd just look up at me...
Maybe you could dance.

47:23.051 --> 47:25.387
And make this face like...

47:25.470 --> 47:29.266
Or something like that. I don't know.
It was great. God, I miss him, but...

47:29.391 --> 47:32.019
Um, sometimes I watch
the Discovery Channel, and...

47:32.102 --> 47:34.354
I don't care!

47:34.438 --> 47:37.608
Could you just dance for me, please?

47:37.733 --> 47:40.194
No, that's my favourite...

47:40.319 --> 47:42.988
It was my favourite shirt.
Uh, okay.

47:43.071 --> 47:46.617
Hey. What?

47:48.076 --> 47:50.037
Nothin'.

47:51.121 --> 47:53.123
It's a crazy party, huh?

48:03.217 --> 48:05.636
Don't worry about him.
You don't worry about him.

48:05.761 --> 48:10.641
He's... He's a... He's a maniac.
And you're a maniac, you know that?

48:17.064 --> 48:20.234
Stifler, why in the world
are you focused on me?

48:20.317 --> 48:22.110
I'm surprised to see
you don't have tits.

48:22.236 --> 48:25.489
How can I clean you
if you are not dirty?

48:25.614 --> 48:29.618
Go put something on that I must clean
off with my tongue.

48:29.743 --> 48:33.121
Ohh. Anything for a French person.

48:33.247 --> 48:36.166
If you insist, Fräulein.

48:45.843 --> 48:49.721
- Ah!

48:49.805 --> 48:51.431
Oh, yeah.

48:51.515 --> 48:53.809
Look at you, you pathetic,
little weasel.

48:53.934 --> 48:55.602
Can't I just watch?

48:55.686 --> 48:59.857
Look, you don't have to do
anything if you don't want to.

48:59.982 --> 49:02.276
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

49:02.359 --> 49:04.736
Don't break character ever again.

49:04.820 --> 49:08.824
Okay? I don't care if Kevin starts crying
because Finch bit his cock off.

49:08.949 --> 49:13.662
You're a dirty cop, you're a prissy maid
and I am your filthy cabana boy in need
of much punishment and cleaning.

49:13.787 --> 49:16.623
Don't you ever mouth off
to Officer Krystal,

49:16.707 --> 49:18.458
- you dirty, little pervert!
- Okay.

49:18.542 --> 49:21.044
Now, obey!
I obey! I obey!

49:21.170 --> 49:22.462
Jesus!

49:40.022 --> 49:41.982
Guys, are we having dinner?

49:47.029 --> 49:48.906
Here, let me get that.

49:52.075 --> 49:54.286
Holy shit!
Stifler.

49:54.369 --> 49:58.081
I've got something really nice cooking
up for you. Well, we love surprises.

49:58.207 --> 50:02.169
Stifler, you said you spoke to Jim. I did.
I was secret about it and everything.

50:02.252 --> 50:05.589
He said he'd be the only one here
tonight. What the fuck, shit-brick?

50:05.714 --> 50:07.841
Chocolate.
Ah, sh...

50:07.966 --> 50:10.719
Now, I told everyone that you were
up north with my parents.

50:10.844 --> 50:14.264
Okay. So we won't be bothered. We can
just, uh, totally relax and no worries.

50:14.389 --> 50:16.642
Please come on in.

50:16.725 --> 50:18.977
Make yourselves at home.
Right this way. Thank you.

50:19.061 --> 50:20.979
Sir.

50:22.523 --> 50:24.900
What?

50:25.025 --> 50:27.361
Pink roses.

50:27.444 --> 50:29.363
Pink roses.
Yeah.

50:30.531 --> 50:34.117
They're nice, aren't they?
Yes. Artificial. Nice try.

50:34.243 --> 50:36.995
Well...
I almost got ya.

50:37.079 --> 50:39.414
Yeah. Well.

50:39.498 --> 50:42.751
So, has Michelle ever told you
the story of how we fell in love?

50:42.876 --> 50:45.379
Oh, why don't you retell us now?

50:45.504 --> 50:48.090
It's... It's one of my favourite stories.
Where should I begin?

50:48.215 --> 50:50.092
Um...

50:50.217 --> 50:52.177
Let's see. Uh...

50:52.261 --> 50:56.348
Well, I suppose, uh...
I suppose it all started at, um...

51:00.769 --> 51:03.522
Tall Oaks.

51:03.605 --> 51:05.983
That's-That's right.
At Tall Oaks.

51:06.108 --> 51:09.027
That was the summer when, uh... Oh!

51:09.111 --> 51:11.238
Oh! The summer that was so hot.

51:11.363 --> 51:13.824
So hot.
All right. Look what I got.

51:13.949 --> 51:15.826
Jesus!

51:15.951 --> 51:17.828
Hey there.
Hi there.

51:17.953 --> 51:21.540
Hey.
Jim, I cannot believe you.

51:23.292 --> 51:27.754
- You can't? - You hired help on our
account? That is entirely unnecessary.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.340
But I will have some of that wine, sir.

51:30.465 --> 51:33.844
- Say, "Please," Harold.
- Please. Of course.

51:33.969 --> 51:38.098
Absolutely. It's what he's here for,
is-is the wine, obviously.

51:38.182 --> 51:41.018
Yes. Evidently.
What else would you be here for?

51:41.143 --> 51:46.273
And-And-And I certainly appreciate
your-your-your courtesy, sir.

51:46.356 --> 51:48.734
Ah. Uh, well, yes.

51:48.817 --> 51:52.529
Uh, we have... we have right here
a 1999...

51:52.654 --> 51:55.282
cabernet seve... um...

51:55.407 --> 51:59.912
full-bodied, masculine wine.

51:59.995 --> 52:02.915
Just shouts sophistication.

52:04.583 --> 52:06.502
- James.
- Yes.

52:06.585 --> 52:10.422
Well, I can see you're very surprised
to see me here. A little bit.

52:10.506 --> 52:12.841
I'm going to go check on the dogs.
Yes, yes!

52:12.966 --> 52:15.969
In fact, why don't you both
go check on the dogs and...

52:16.094 --> 52:19.515
No, no, no. Don't check on the dogs.
They're fine.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.392
- How do you know?
- Because I just checked on the dogs.

52:22.518 --> 52:25.020
Because he just checked on the dogs.
Good work, man. I did.

52:25.145 --> 52:27.523
- Jim, I'll help you with the turkey.
- Okay.

52:27.606 --> 52:30.526
Um, and I'll keep you company.

52:30.651 --> 52:32.528
Thank you. Whoo.

52:32.653 --> 52:35.906
So, how long have you been
a sommelier, Mr., um...

52:36.031 --> 52:38.534
Belvedere, ma'am.
Oh. Belvedere.

52:39.660 --> 52:41.537
It's chilly in here.

52:41.662 --> 52:44.289
So, how long do we have to
stay in here for?

52:44.373 --> 52:46.875
I don't know.
They said to hide.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.294
I guess we'll just wait
for 'em to call us.

52:49.378 --> 52:52.381
Who knows what kind of kinky shit
they're getting ready for us.

52:52.506 --> 52:54.466
Do these go
in your ass tonight or mine?

52:57.594 --> 53:00.138
Do you have a serving dish ready?

53:01.849 --> 53:02.182
- Jim.
- Hmm?

53:02.307 --> 53:04.601
We need a serving dish.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

53:05.519 --> 53:07.479
- Oh!
- What?

53:09.356 --> 53:12.359
- Nothing.
- Then why the excitement?

53:12.484 --> 53:14.820
I thought, uh, the-the dish was broken.

53:14.903 --> 53:17.114
Well, is it?
No.

53:17.197 --> 53:19.116
Then, are you going to get it?
Yes.
