02:45.376 --> 02:48.918
The day of reckoning
is a beast of its own.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.793
It creeps up on you unawares.

02:51.793 --> 02:54.876
It arrives on a whim,
with its head held high.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.543
And burns everything to ashes.

03:06.543 --> 03:08.876
I still remember that
winter of my childhood.

03:10.043 --> 03:11.460
The harshest we had seen in a while.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.460
It was as though the valley was
shrouded in the sheet of death.

03:47.793 --> 03:49.501
Let me go.

03:57.418 --> 03:58.460
Leave me.

04:05.751 --> 04:06.918
Name?

04:08.293 --> 04:09.501
Your name?

04:13.543 --> 04:14.585
Noon.

04:15.543 --> 04:17.000
Noor what?

04:17.168 --> 04:18.125
Nizami.

04:18.793 --> 04:19.793
Noor Nizami.

04:20.918 --> 04:26.501
Look, I haven't had a drop of water
since the past two days.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.960
I want to eat something right now.

04:30.626 --> 04:34.460
If not, I swear I will tear you apart.

04:36.001 --> 04:39.293
And, don't even think of running.

04:39.918 --> 04:42.376
I'll find you and tear you to pieces.

06:04.751 --> 06:07.001
We were a group of five.

06:07.168 --> 06:09.918
Three were killed by the army
on the border.

06:09.918 --> 06:15.293
One of us had turned traitor.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.043
I dug out that bastard from hell.

06:19.043 --> 06:20.793
And gouged his eye out.

06:22.626 --> 06:25.626
Now his one eye will haunt him
for the rest of his life.

06:29.168 --> 06:32.751
Is there a place
where I can spend the night?

07:10.626 --> 07:15.168
- Warning!
- The army has you surrounded.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.168
- We don't want any loss to life.

07:18.668 --> 07:20.710
- Give up your arms. Surrender!

07:20.876 --> 07:23.085
- Check over there.

07:24.168 --> 07:26.751
- We are warning you again.

07:26.918 --> 07:29.293
- Give up your arms.

07:29.293 --> 07:30.501
- Surrender!

07:30.668 --> 07:33.085
- Or you'll be killed.

07:52.793 --> 07:54.793
Give me the tool box.

07:57.126 --> 07:58.085
Noora.

07:59.751 --> 08:02.251
So we are catching a cold now, are we?

08:03.168 --> 08:05.251
Where were you last night?

08:06.043 --> 08:08.876
I fell asleep waiting for you.

08:09.043 --> 08:12.293
I had sent him...
to get the tools from the tool shed.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.418
I was stuck in the snow, sister.

08:14.418 --> 08:18.251
You two have worked hard enough
to create the Taj Mahal!

08:18.793 --> 08:20.501
Are the designs for the
embroidery ready?

08:26.918 --> 08:28.626
Why don't you show them?

08:30.293 --> 08:32.335
You both can do as you please.

08:33.043 --> 08:35.960
I request you to
please come home early.

08:36.126 --> 08:38.085
Eid preparations haven't even begun yet.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.251
Go carefully, dear.

08:40.626 --> 08:42.710
The situation in the city is not safe.

08:44.251 --> 08:45.918
Why do you do this?

08:46.543 --> 08:48.376
You know she gets worried.

08:48.543 --> 08:50.751
How long will I cover for you?

09:03.293 --> 09:04.918
These are beautiful, Noor!

09:05.751 --> 09:07.335
Have you made this?

09:08.543 --> 09:10.418
Why didn't you show them to her?

09:10.418 --> 09:12.460
This time I want a hefty Eid gift.

09:12.626 --> 09:14.376
Don't be miserly.

09:16.168 --> 09:20.418
In cross firing with the army
three millitants were killed.

09:20.418 --> 09:23.751
Millitant commander Muazzam Bhatt
is still at large.

09:23.918 --> 09:26.293
The situation has worsened

09:26.293 --> 09:29.460
after the flag was hoisted on Lal Chowk.

09:29.626 --> 09:32.210
The army is on high alert.
There is patrolling everywhere.

09:32.626 --> 09:36.626
The Begum has called me to
the mansion to repair the roof.

09:37.293 --> 09:38.960
Thank God.

09:39.501 --> 09:42.335
If the Begum is generous,
we'll make it through this winter.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.501
Our houseboat is hardly running this year.

09:47.668 --> 09:49.251
Take this mister, too.

09:50.043 --> 09:52.626
Let him know what it's like
to work for a living.

09:53.543 --> 09:55.585
That'll get him in shape.

10:17.543 --> 10:20.293
The Begum came from a princely family.

10:20.293 --> 10:22.418
Pretty as an angel.

10:22.626 --> 10:24.626
Her mother was from Lucknow.

10:24.793 --> 10:27.418
There was a rumour many years ago

10:27.418 --> 10:30.751
that spread like wild fire.

10:31.043 --> 10:33.251
Someone cast an evil eye on that family.

10:41.668 --> 10:43.918
The Begum is a strict one.

10:44.418 --> 10:47.626
She will not stand any misbehavior.

10:48.418 --> 10:50.460
Concentrate on your work.

10:51.001 --> 10:53.210
Keep an apology and
a greeting always handy.

10:53.876 --> 10:56.168
If anyone asks,
present it immediately.

10:57.376 --> 11:01.001
The city folk say that
the mansion is haunted.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.210
Noora, be careful of the ghosts.

12:01.543 --> 12:04.335
Junaid, tea?

13:23.126 --> 13:25.376
Stop staring.

13:33.876 --> 13:36.626
Firdaus, mother is waiting.

14:12.251 --> 14:16.668
F-I-R-D-A-U-S

14:18.043 --> 14:19.418
Firdaus.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.251
Listen.

15:10.918 --> 15:12.168
Mother has called you inside.

15:12.793 --> 15:14.460
We'll be there in two minutes.

15:15.126 --> 15:17.376
Not you. You may rest.

15:17.543 --> 15:18.710
Only him.

15:35.876 --> 15:37.293
My Sling?

15:38.001 --> 15:38.918
What?

15:38.918 --> 15:40.210
Sling.

15:40.793 --> 15:42.376
Forget about it.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.751
Don't even think of telling anyone.

15:44.751 --> 15:47.335
That'll be in your best interest.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.460
You are so beautiful.

15:50.460 --> 15:53.001
How did you learn to speak so sweetly?

15:55.501 --> 15:57.210
Don't let your eyes wander

15:57.210 --> 15:59.335
and your words will automatically
become sweet too.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.418
What did you say his name is?

16:06.418 --> 16:08.335
Noon.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.668
Master Hoor, what do you do?

16:11.168 --> 16:13.168
What can you do?

16:13.168 --> 16:14.960
Not Hoor, it is Noor.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.835
What do I need to do?

16:18.376 --> 16:21.668
Damn, it always stops here.

16:24.835 --> 16:29.210
Sing me something.

16:29.626 --> 16:32.626
Something that will touch my soul.

16:32.626 --> 16:35.335
I haven't cried since a very long time.

16:37.418 --> 16:51.710
Kashmiri Folk Song.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.668
Excellent, Firdaus.

17:01.168 --> 17:03.460
Where did you find him?

17:05.335 --> 17:08.751
Sir Noor Khan,
aren't you a little gem?

17:10.376 --> 17:12.292
What else can you do?

17:13.126 --> 17:15.917
Can you ride a horse?

17:16.585 --> 17:17.417
What?

17:18.085 --> 17:21.042
Do you at least know
how to tend to the horses?

17:22.917 --> 17:25.960
Mother, take a look at his shoes.

17:29.043 --> 17:32.210
So from tomorrow,
you will look after our stables.

17:32.918 --> 17:36.501
If you work diligently,
you will be rewarded well.

17:38.001 --> 17:40.085
And don't think that I'm offering you a job

17:40.085 --> 17:42.626
because I'm impressed with your singing.

17:45.126 --> 17:47.335
Firdaus liked your shoes.

17:48.043 --> 17:50.668
And I cannot say no to her.

17:53.710 --> 17:56.293
Firdaus will have someone to play with.

17:58.876 --> 18:01.335
But you don't play loose with your heart.

18:01.335 --> 18:04.001
This is the age for you to have fun.

18:04.710 --> 18:08.210
Save all your heartbreaks for later.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.626
Take a token from Kaleem
on your way out.

18:19.793 --> 18:22.960
You are now going to be
a part of this legacy.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.585
Your honour is ours.

18:28.585 --> 18:31.501
Wear something decent from tomorrow.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.126
There is a world beyond shoes, sir.

18:37.043 --> 18:39.293
I'll take your leave then.

18:43.876 --> 18:46.793
Who knew that God had His grace on this one?

18:47.001 --> 18:50.376
Now, he'll finally be of some use.

18:50.376 --> 18:52.835
You must do everything to
keep them happy.

18:52.835 --> 18:54.251
Are you listening?

18:54.251 --> 18:56.876
Don't do anything silly this time.

18:56.876 --> 19:00.251
Begum can change
your life if she wishes to.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.460
With the soft threads of Pashmina.

19:25.460 --> 19:31.043
Someone spins her dreams.

19:31.043 --> 19:32.918
How so?

19:32.918 --> 19:37.293
The abundant hills echo.

19:37.501 --> 19:42.793
New songs, these instruments.

19:43.085 --> 19:44.918
How so?

19:44.918 --> 19:49.293
With the soft threads of Pashmina.

19:50.960 --> 19:54.876
The blossoms have just altered.

19:55.418 --> 20:00.793
Their moods, feelings.

20:01.085 --> 20:02.918
How so?

20:02.918 --> 20:07.501
The eyes have revealed.

20:07.501 --> 20:13.085
New secrets, emotions.

20:13.085 --> 20:14.960
How so?

20:14.960 --> 20:19.126
With the soft threads of Pashmina.

20:19.460 --> 20:24.585
Someone spins her dreams.

20:25.043 --> 20:27.210
How so?

20:52.876 --> 20:56.168
It was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness.

20:56.168 --> 20:59.501
It was the season of light,
it was the season of darkness.

20:59.501 --> 21:00.585
It was the...

21:07.751 --> 21:13.793
Delicate breeze blends with the young smoke.

21:13.793 --> 21:19.835
The youthful heart seeks new moments.

21:19.835 --> 21:25.876
Tepid sunshine slips on the untrodden paths.

21:25.876 --> 21:30.835
Somebody surreptitiously whispers

21:30.835 --> 21:33.668
I will be your shadow.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.085
Walk behind you.

21:37.085 --> 21:41.001
Walk on with you.

21:41.918 --> 21:45.918
With the soft threads of Pashmina.

21:46.293 --> 21:52.043
Someone spins her dreams.

21:52.043 --> 21:54.960
How so?

22:06.043 --> 22:10.293
The abundant hills echo.

22:10.293 --> 22:14.626
New songs, these instruments.

22:16.918 --> 22:19.918
The Narangs are offering a
cut above the market price.

22:19.918 --> 22:24.085
They want to turn this mansion
into a heritage hotel.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.543
Tell me one thing, Zafar.

22:26.543 --> 22:29.293
Has your father not left
you with anything?

22:29.626 --> 22:32.918
You come here salivating every year.

22:34.293 --> 22:40.835
Now please do me a favour
and get your sorry face out of here.

22:43.126 --> 22:44.835
Sell it, sister.

22:45.376 --> 22:47.543
The market situation is bleak.

22:47.543 --> 22:49.835
Jagirdar, show them out.

22:53.251 --> 22:55.376
The old woman has lost her head.

22:55.376 --> 22:58.251
She has wasted more than half her
fortune on jewelry.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.835
She should be sent to Tussauds.

22:59.835 --> 23:00.960
They will take her as is.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.001
Calm down, Sameera.

23:02.001 --> 23:03.668
There is jack shit we can do.

23:14.293 --> 23:17.585
14th October. 3:10 pm.

23:18.793 --> 23:21.585
Remember the day and time.

23:23.251 --> 23:25.626
I made you my friend today.

23:28.251 --> 23:30.293
It's my birthday next week.

23:30.293 --> 23:32.085
You have to come.

23:32.085 --> 23:33.085
Don't forget.

23:36.668 --> 23:39.335
Stop staring, Noor.
It's bad manners.

23:56.876 --> 23:58.585
Did he like it?

24:00.751 --> 24:01.793
Yes, mother.

24:05.293 --> 24:07.126
I saw him.

24:07.585 --> 24:09.751
He couldn't let go of it.

24:09.751 --> 24:12.168
I have invited him on Sunday.

24:40.918 --> 24:43.293
Dear, at this rate the world
will come to an end

24:43.293 --> 24:46.251
and you still won't know what to wear.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.001
And anyway, if Rukhsar figures out,

24:49.001 --> 24:51.626
who knows what she will do to us.

24:52.918 --> 24:55.251
You are really scared of her, aren't you?

24:55.918 --> 24:57.960
You can't hurry these things.

24:59.043 --> 25:01.585
It's Firdaus' birthday.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.335
Not your regular local fair.

25:06.293 --> 25:07.626
Sure, I'm looking good?

25:07.626 --> 25:08.835
Yes, like a prince.

25:08.835 --> 25:09.876
Noor!

25:13.876 --> 25:15.960
There now, sister has seen my outfit too.

26:04.460 --> 26:16.543
Prayer for the departed.

26:42.668 --> 26:43.793
Firdaus!

26:50.960 --> 26:52.293
Firdaus!

26:52.293 --> 26:54.293
You've come now?

26:55.751 --> 26:58.376
The birthday was yesterday.

26:59.210 --> 27:02.418
Firdaus will now wait for
you on her next birthday.

27:02.876 --> 27:04.335
Where is Firdaus?

27:04.335 --> 27:08.835
Firdaus.

27:10.085 --> 27:18.710
If there is a heaven on earth,
it is here. It is here.

27:23.793 --> 27:27.460
These are cruel times.

27:28.710 --> 27:31.793
Everyone wants a piece of this heaven.

27:33.126 --> 27:35.501
I've sent Firdaus to school in London.

27:36.335 --> 27:39.085
This is no place for her to grow up in.

27:39.626 --> 27:42.501
Bombs go off anywhere.

27:42.501 --> 27:44.960
She was choking here.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.460
Now you catch your breath too.

27:52.626 --> 27:57.085
Don't believe what your eyes see.

28:00.168 --> 28:02.460
Listen to your heart, Noor.

28:04.335 --> 28:06.835
But now it isn't yours anymore.

28:08.835 --> 28:10.710
You have given it away.

28:11.918 --> 28:14.251
I told you not to.

28:21.168 --> 28:23.001
It broke, didn't it?

28:26.126 --> 28:29.710
Love is not simple, Noor.

28:30.626 --> 28:34.835
You will either sink or swim.

28:39.460 --> 28:43.960
You have to become someone
to be deserving of Firdaus.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.501
It's not so easy to enter her world.

28:46.501 --> 28:48.751
You will have to give it your all.

28:48.751 --> 28:50.501
You are no longer a child.

28:50.501 --> 28:52.960
Stop crying and go home.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.960
The situation here is getting
from bad to worse.

28:56.626 --> 28:58.543
Stay alive, Noor.

28:59.168 --> 29:01.210
You are no use, dead.

29:01.626 --> 29:05.210
Neither to Firdaus, nor to me.

29:24.210 --> 29:27.043
And just like that,
everything came to an end.

29:28.460 --> 29:32.335
Begum's words kept swirling
around in my head.

29:33.210 --> 29:35.710
As though a chasm opened up inside of me

29:35.710 --> 29:38.543
and I kept falling, deep down.

29:39.085 --> 29:41.293
A deep black chasm.

29:42.001 --> 29:45.835
So dark that even my screams
were dying inside.

30:13.376 --> 30:15.918
Days turned to months
and months to years.

30:15.918 --> 30:18.251
I couldn't get her out of my heart.

30:18.668 --> 30:23.626
But I could at least look for her

30:23.626 --> 30:26.293
in every living spark,
in every dying ember.

30:27.251 --> 30:28.960
She, who was not anywhere.

30:29.668 --> 30:31.418
She, who was everywhere.

30:32.501 --> 30:34.001
Finish the rest tomorrow.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.460
Let's go get dinner.

30:40.960 --> 30:43.460
I will sleep in the shed tonight.

30:54.210 --> 30:55.251
Jiju?

31:01.668 --> 31:04.376
I told Junaid so many times.

31:05.543 --> 31:08.585
I even sent the art books with Kaleem.

31:10.918 --> 31:12.793
You didn't even come to meet me once.

31:13.876 --> 31:18.001
I got busy with work in the shop.

31:29.418 --> 31:31.460
So much pain.

31:34.001 --> 31:36.460
How do you bring
so much pain in your art?

31:39.376 --> 31:41.960
I recognized you the minute
I laid eyes on you.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.751
I've pared a lot of jewels in my time.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.710
Today is an auspicious day.

32:11.668 --> 32:14.501
I would like the good fortune

32:14.501 --> 32:18.376
of being your first patron.

32:24.501 --> 32:26.918
It is your first earning.
Savour it.

32:28.710 --> 32:31.168
Your new life starts from today.

32:33.210 --> 32:34.835
God bless you.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.001
Any news of Firdaus, Begum?

32:50.418 --> 32:53.085
You may want to ask
on me too, sometime.

32:54.251 --> 32:56.918
Firdaus is in Delhi.

32:56.918 --> 32:59.043
She was asking about you.

33:01.168 --> 33:03.876
Good thing we met.

33:04.585 --> 33:06.876
Now there's lots to tell her.

33:20.543 --> 33:22.251
Nooruddin Nizami.

33:22.418 --> 33:23.585
Age - 23 years.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.335
There is good news.

33:25.501 --> 33:28.918
He has been chosen for an
Arts Scholarship.

33:29.918 --> 33:30.835
'Art for Freedom'.

33:31.001 --> 33:33.126
They are promoting young artists.

33:33.293 --> 33:36.293
In short, his life is about to change.

33:38.501 --> 33:40.876
There is a small clause.

33:41.043 --> 33:44.460
He will have to go to Delhi
and join a residency program.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.960
He'll get an allowance every month.

33:47.126 --> 33:50.876
All expenses like food and stay
will be borne by my client.

33:53.293 --> 33:54.626
Your client? Is it the Begum?

33:54.793 --> 33:56.585
Clause 5.

33:56.751 --> 33:59.293
I do not have the liberty to
disclose the name.

34:00.043 --> 34:03.335
My client wants his training
to start as soon as possible.

34:04.043 --> 34:05.418
Why me?

34:07.626 --> 34:08.835
Why was I chosen?

34:10.751 --> 34:13.001
Think of it as God's grace.

34:13.168 --> 34:16.126
What we know as 'Lady Luck'

34:17.001 --> 34:19.418
or 'Kismet'.

34:20.168 --> 34:22.001
See you in Delhi, then.

34:28.793 --> 34:31.668
But Jun-jiju, I can't just leave you.

34:34.168 --> 34:36.376
There is nothing left here, child.

34:36.543 --> 34:39.751
You'll just rot sitting here.

34:41.793 --> 34:44.168
The one above is paving the way for you.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.293
Don't fight Him anymore.

34:55.751 --> 34:58.460
If there is heaven on earth.

34:58.626 --> 35:00.960
It is here, it is here.

35:01.126 --> 35:04.043
My life, my soul, my heart are committed.

35:04.043 --> 35:08.043
It is here, it is here.

35:18.751 --> 35:20.460
Jun-jiju's prayers worked for me.

35:21.626 --> 35:25.210
Whether it was God's mercy
or Begum's largesse.

35:25.376 --> 35:27.751
But I'd found my purpose.

35:28.501 --> 35:33.335
As though the world was calling out to me.

35:33.501 --> 35:35.085
It was extending its arms.

35:35.251 --> 35:36.835
Go, embrace it.

35:53.043 --> 35:54.626
I have spoken to the landlord.

35:54.793 --> 35:57.585
He already has one year's rent in advance.

36:08.668 --> 36:11.376
Your residency starts tomorrow.

36:11.918 --> 36:16.418
Leena Becker, who is a renowned curator,
will be in charge of you.

36:16.668 --> 36:19.085
She will explain the rest.

36:20.751 --> 36:21.626
Alright?

36:24.043 --> 36:24.876
Yes.

36:58.376 --> 36:59.210
Good morning!

37:00.668 --> 37:03.043
Sorry for all the noise last night.

37:03.043 --> 37:04.293
Some breakfast?

37:07.668 --> 37:09.001
Noor, right?

37:09.168 --> 37:11.793
Arif Peerbhoy. Come, join us.

37:14.293 --> 37:16.585
Jagirdar had said you would be coming.

37:17.668 --> 37:18.876
Please have a seat.

37:22.376 --> 37:24.001
So, artist, huh?

37:25.043 --> 37:26.835
I dabble a bit in it myself.

37:27.001 --> 37:29.418
I have a small collection.
Mostly new guys.

37:30.293 --> 37:31.751
What are you working on currently?

37:31.918 --> 37:33.376
I am still searching.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.460
For?

37:34.626 --> 37:35.501
Myself.

37:35.793 --> 37:37.126
Not bad.

37:37.293 --> 37:39.043
So, full on exploration happening, huh?

37:39.043 --> 37:41.001
You are from Kashmir, isn't it?

37:41.543 --> 37:44.168
Begum Hazrat Jaan is my aunt.

37:45.293 --> 37:49.210
Tell me, what is the equation
between you and the Begum?

37:49.376 --> 37:50.501
She is a piece of work.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.460
Be careful of her.

37:54.918 --> 37:57.043
Anyway, the room on top is also mine.

37:57.043 --> 37:58.668
You can work here in peace.

37:58.668 --> 37:59.835
It's an open house.
Feel free.

38:00.001 --> 38:02.335
I'm going to cancel my yoga today.

38:02.501 --> 38:05.126
I can't do it. Just can't.

38:07.293 --> 38:09.751
So do you come to Kashmir often?

38:10.668 --> 38:12.793
Who will go to that haunted house?

38:12.793 --> 38:14.918
She's cut off all links with family.

38:16.293 --> 38:20.335
Tell me something,
how can someone live so alone?

38:21.168 --> 38:23.501
It is not so simple to understand her.

38:23.668 --> 38:27.126
I have seen her heart.
She does quite a lot for others.

38:28.168 --> 38:29.751
You mean for you?

38:32.043 --> 38:33.585
I am just messing with you.

38:34.001 --> 38:35.543
So, what is the plan for today?

38:35.543 --> 38:37.460
I have a meeting with Leena Becker.

38:38.001 --> 38:39.001
LBG Gallery.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.626
Not bad.

38:40.793 --> 38:42.001
Home-run right on arrival.

38:47.543 --> 38:49.418
- Have you settled in?
- Yes.

38:49.418 --> 38:52.168
- Did you like the studio?
- Yes.

38:52.168 --> 38:55.210
I saw the pictures you sent.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.085
They are somewhat interesting.

38:57.418 --> 39:00.501
But your work needs presentation.

39:00.668 --> 39:04.376
It needs scale.
And, it needs context.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.251
And that is where we come in.

39:06.918 --> 39:09.793
The India Art Summit
will take place next month.

39:09.793 --> 39:12.751
And your first piece of work
will be exhibited there.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.293
This is your space.

39:16.043 --> 39:18.460
Fill it up.
You have six weeks.

39:21.168 --> 39:22.585
Nervous?

39:24.043 --> 39:25.085
Good!

39:25.918 --> 39:28.251
People really sweat it
out to reach here, Noor.

39:28.918 --> 39:31.960
From here on,
there are no shortcuts.

39:35.793 --> 39:38.001
Don't worry, it will all fall into place.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.335
Okay?

39:39.501 --> 39:40.793
Welcome to Delhi.

39:41.418 --> 39:42.418
Good luck!

39:43.626 --> 39:44.960
Leena's a tough cookie, no?

39:45.418 --> 39:47.418
The gallery was a real eye-opener, man.

39:47.876 --> 39:49.418
I am feeling a tad scared.

39:50.626 --> 39:52.085
Let's see. We'll do something.

39:52.251 --> 39:53.751
That's the shit, man!

39:53.918 --> 39:55.710
Show them what's inside.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.460
To the future.

40:05.626 --> 40:07.876
Hey, what's up? How are you, man?

41:04.043 --> 41:05.668
Firdaus!

41:29.543 --> 41:31.501
By the way, have you met
Leena's new boy?

41:34.293 --> 41:35.251
Just come in from Srinagar.

41:35.418 --> 41:37.210
Go say hi to him.

41:44.751 --> 41:47.251
Sir Noor Khan.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.210
Rising star!

41:51.126 --> 41:52.751
How's Delhi treating you, love?

41:56.543 --> 41:59.085
Stop staring, Noor.

42:00.168 --> 42:01.668
How old are you?

42:02.793 --> 42:05.043
Hi babes, let's go!

42:05.793 --> 42:07.210
Coming.

42:29.918 --> 42:32.835
There was so much
that I wanted to ask her.

42:33.001 --> 42:35.501
So many whys, whats, whens

42:36.293 --> 42:39.960
things I'd buried inside all these years

42:40.126 --> 42:42.501
they all flowed out as love.

42:43.376 --> 42:45.043
Firdaus.

42:46.001 --> 42:47.710
I had met my match.

42:56.043 --> 42:57.335
You guys are mad.

42:58.501 --> 42:59.626
Bye!

43:12.543 --> 43:15.626
Mother mentioned that
you were going to come.

43:15.793 --> 43:20.126
She especially told me to,
'Take care of Noor'.

43:23.918 --> 43:26.335
So, you finally got here.

43:26.501 --> 43:28.376
Half my life has gone by.

43:28.543 --> 43:30.585
If not now, then when?

43:33.043 --> 43:34.668
You are just the same.

43:36.668 --> 43:37.626
So...

43:38.668 --> 43:40.793
when are you exhibiting?

43:40.793 --> 43:41.793
Next month.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.210
I'll come for it.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.543
Your honour is ours.

43:55.918 --> 43:57.626
So then, how do you like it?

43:59.751 --> 44:01.210
Very beautiful.

44:01.668 --> 44:03.251
Firdaus Jaan Naqvi.

44:03.418 --> 44:05.585
London School of Design.

44:06.001 --> 44:09.543
Looking at you, even I learned
to make a sketch or two.

44:11.168 --> 44:13.460
Did you get those sketches
I sent every year?

44:14.418 --> 44:18.085
Sir Noor Khan, I have a boyfriend now.

44:18.918 --> 44:22.460
The ring should be here any day now.

44:23.751 --> 44:25.918
Noor, where the hell are you?

44:25.918 --> 44:28.168
I've been looking all over for you.

44:29.043 --> 44:31.043
Calm down, Arif.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.418
Let's get you another drink.

44:32.418 --> 44:33.710
Okay.

44:58.626 --> 45:05.501
Life has conspired.

45:08.293 --> 45:10.626
Our work is about our dreams and desires.

45:10.793 --> 45:12.710
It's what you make other people see.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.668
I hope you enjoy the show.

45:16.168 --> 45:18.043
So when are you exhibiting your work?

45:18.043 --> 45:19.335
Yes... er...

45:20.293 --> 45:22.793
In a few weeks.
His work is beautiful.

45:25.918 --> 45:26.501
Hello.

45:26.668 --> 45:28.168
Are you stalking me?

45:28.876 --> 45:30.751
Up, here.

45:33.126 --> 45:41.626
My obsession has brought me close to you.

45:41.793 --> 45:50.376
My obsession is your mercy.

45:50.626 --> 45:59.251
My obsession changed my destiny.

45:59.418 --> 46:06.626
Your love is my obsession.

46:06.793 --> 46:12.210
O my Lord!

46:30.876 --> 46:38.376
My desires were burning slowly.

46:39.626 --> 46:45.960
Wishes buried deep in my heart were stifling.

46:48.376 --> 46:52.668
Carried through to you in a smolder.

46:52.668 --> 46:57.043
O my Lord!

46:57.043 --> 47:01.293
I have scratched the threshold of madness.

47:01.293 --> 47:04.293
O my Lord!

47:05.168 --> 47:13.376
My obsession has brought me close to you.

47:13.918 --> 47:22.543
My obsession has brought me close to you.

47:22.876 --> 47:31.460
My obsession is your mercy.

47:31.668 --> 47:39.918
My obsession changed my destiny.

47:40.418 --> 47:47.626
Your love is my obsession.

47:48.751 --> 47:51.043
O my Lord!

47:51.793 --> 47:52.876
Like it?

48:04.418 --> 48:06.668
And now for our show-stopper
of the evening,

48:06.668 --> 48:08.751
the 'Freedom for Art' series.

48:08.918 --> 48:12.043
Feast your eyes guys.
It's all been sold.

48:12.543 --> 48:16.126
Presenting the man of the hour,
Noor Nizami.

48:19.543 --> 48:21.126
What is the story behind this?

48:21.293 --> 48:24.168
Is this your idea of present day Kashmir?

48:24.543 --> 48:27.001
It just hurt and I poured it out.

48:28.543 --> 48:30.751
You cannot see art and politics separately.

48:30.918 --> 48:35.043
Speaking of politics,
what is your take on the ground reality?

48:35.043 --> 48:36.960
Do you also want freedom?

48:38.668 --> 48:40.585
Isn't this much freedom enough?

48:41.543 --> 48:44.126
I am alive. Breathing.

48:45.418 --> 48:47.751
Standing here, amidst all you fine people.

49:03.043 --> 49:07.960
I will only say, that to me,
Kashmir will always be the same.

49:09.126 --> 49:10.793
Pure.

49:10.793 --> 49:12.293
Beautiful.

49:12.293 --> 49:13.876
Soulful.

49:15.793 --> 49:17.043
I may be cursed like that.

49:17.043 --> 49:20.418
That the heart yearns for
what once was.

49:22.043 --> 49:24.626
Those sweet fragrant days of my past.

49:42.501 --> 49:43.876
How do you like it?

49:46.793 --> 49:47.751
Very beautiful!

49:55.626 --> 49:57.210
You are looking smart.

49:59.168 --> 50:00.668
Be wary of other girls.

50:08.376 --> 50:09.751
You should've let me drive, sis.

50:09.918 --> 50:11.793
You drive like a girl, Arif.

50:11.793 --> 50:14.418
Why drink more than you can handle?

50:35.626 --> 50:37.751
I am getting engaged.

50:39.043 --> 50:40.251
I told you.

50:41.751 --> 50:44.293
Don't you ever listen?

50:46.293 --> 50:49.168
Bilal and I were together at
college in London.

50:50.751 --> 50:54.126
His father was a Minister
in the Pakistan government.

50:55.418 --> 50:57.043
Now Bilal is next in line.

51:02.168 --> 51:04.335
Don't you get scared of anything?

51:05.751 --> 51:07.251
I do.

51:08.876 --> 51:10.460
I am scared that you will go away again.

51:14.501 --> 51:17.293
But this time it won't be easy.

51:17.918 --> 51:19.626
We'll have to wage war.

51:21.168 --> 51:23.876
They already lost the '65 and '71 wars.

51:24.793 --> 51:26.710
Even the one in '99.

51:29.043 --> 51:30.793
Has his visa come in?

51:35.293 --> 51:36.251
Idiot!

51:47.293 --> 51:48.751
Greetings, mother.

51:48.918 --> 51:50.876
My dear child.

51:51.043 --> 51:52.876
How are things?

51:53.043 --> 51:55.043
You didn't call yesterday.

51:55.918 --> 51:57.710
Yes, I forgot.

51:59.126 --> 52:01.668
Besides, there's nothing much
to report everyday.

52:01.668 --> 52:04.418
There must be something... surely.

52:07.876 --> 52:09.335
Did you meet Noor?

52:09.668 --> 52:11.501
Did you go for the exhibition?

52:11.668 --> 52:12.501
Yes, mother.

52:13.168 --> 52:15.960
He couldn't stay away, could he?

52:16.126 --> 52:18.918
So, how did you find him?

52:19.793 --> 52:21.168
He's sweet.

52:21.751 --> 52:23.043
He keeps hovering around.

52:25.418 --> 52:27.251
Keep him behind you.

52:28.918 --> 52:31.376
Everything ahead has been decided.

52:31.543 --> 52:34.501
As for the rest, you are smart enough.

52:52.418 --> 52:55.835
I wouldn't have recognized you
if I saw you like this the first time.

53:15.085 --> 53:16.085
Don't!

53:20.376 --> 53:23.126
I have captured you,
Firdaus Jaan Naqvi.

53:23.293 --> 53:26.043
I thought you would set me free.

53:27.835 --> 53:28.876
You, too?

53:30.210 --> 53:33.126
Only death can free you from yourself.

53:39.085 --> 53:40.043
Or love.

54:29.626 --> 54:37.126
My desires were burning slowly.

54:38.376 --> 54:44.710
Wishes buried deep in my heart were stifling.

54:47.126 --> 54:51.335
Carried through to you in a smolder.

54:51.501 --> 54:55.668
O my Lord!

54:56.001 --> 55:00.001
I have scratched the threshold of madness.

55:00.168 --> 55:03.043
O my Lord!

55:06.585 --> 55:08.585
Mr. Frost, how are you?

55:08.960 --> 55:09.960
Good.

55:10.126 --> 55:11.376
Your consignment is on its way.

55:11.543 --> 55:13.043
It'll be with you Tuesday morning.

55:13.210 --> 55:14.793
Your client's gonna love it.

55:36.585 --> 55:39.710
The first thing a man does when he
comes to the city is to buy a home.

55:39.876 --> 55:41.335
Such an expensive car?

55:41.501 --> 55:43.668
And that too a secondhand one?

55:43.835 --> 55:45.876
You sure, man?

55:50.960 --> 55:52.543
Sure as the day I was born.

55:54.626 --> 56:02.793
My obsession has brought me close to you.

56:03.376 --> 56:11.960
My obsession is your mercy.

56:12.335 --> 56:19.543
Your love is my obsession.

56:20.418 --> 56:22.543
O my Lord!

56:31.751 --> 56:33.543
Where are we going?

56:33.710 --> 56:37.418
Back in time.
To a time unknown.

56:40.960 --> 56:43.543
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

56:43.710 --> 56:46.876
It was the age of wisdom.
It was the age of foolishness.

56:47.043 --> 56:50.001
It was...

56:51.251 --> 56:54.293
I gave you the book to read,
not to memorise.

57:34.835 --> 57:35.626
- Noor!

57:35.626 --> 57:37.418
- Yes, Leena.
- Since when I've been trying to reach you.

57:37.585 --> 57:39.960
You are going to exhibit at Hayworth!

57:40.126 --> 57:40.835
Yes?

57:41.210 --> 57:42.335
Pack your bags, my friend.

57:42.501 --> 57:44.335
We're off to London.
Congratulations, Noor!

57:44.501 --> 57:45.460
Thank you.

57:45.626 --> 57:47.126
This is a big one.

57:47.293 --> 57:48.126
Bye.

57:55.126 --> 57:56.543
It was Leena.

57:57.460 --> 57:59.793
There is a mail from the
London organisers.

57:59.960 --> 58:02.168
My work has been selected for Hayworth.

58:04.043 --> 58:04.876
Come here.

58:10.293 --> 58:12.001
Congratulations!

58:13.085 --> 58:15.251
I am really happy for you.

58:15.876 --> 58:16.751
What the hell are you doing?

58:16.918 --> 58:18.376
You arrived just yesterday.

58:19.793 --> 58:20.668
From Kashmir to Delhi.

58:20.668 --> 58:23.085
Delhi to London.
This guy is amazing.

58:23.251 --> 58:24.751
You are everywhere, bro.

58:27.543 --> 58:28.835
Cheers to Noor!

58:37.543 --> 58:40.001
Congratulations, Noor. All the best!

59:13.335 --> 59:19.168
Firdaus, the first time I saw you,
my head just exploded.

59:22.918 --> 59:24.460
Let me speak.

59:24.626 --> 59:29.585
This is my time, this is my place.

59:32.210 --> 59:33.335
Do you know, Firdaus

59:33.501 --> 59:36.501
I remember each and
everything about you.

59:38.126 --> 59:42.085
Your scarf. Your books.

59:47.668 --> 59:50.168
That long snake-like car.

59:52.585 --> 59:54.793
The red of the Chinar tree.

59:55.418 --> 59:58.418
All those moments that I've lived
every waking day.

59:59.376 --> 01:00:03.626
Who'd have thought that
we'd meet like this years later?

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:06.751
That we would be sitting here?

01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:08.876
Your mother kept telling me...

01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:10.001
Shh...

01:00:12.335 --> 01:00:13.876
I love this song.

01:02:54.835 --> 01:02:58.376
No, I have to go.

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:22.210
I love you!

01:05:29.585 --> 01:05:31.543
I don't believe you.

01:05:32.043 --> 01:05:33.960
You still have it?

01:05:35.876 --> 01:05:36.876
You are crazy!

01:05:37.668 --> 01:05:39.543
What's so crazy about it?

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.543
It's my prized possession.

01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:44.335
Like how you have your jewels.

01:05:49.626 --> 01:05:51.710
We were young then, Noor.

01:06:05.043 --> 01:06:06.043
Yes.

01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:12.168
Does it matter to you
if I'm alive or dead, Firdaus?

01:06:13.543 --> 01:06:15.668
Just tell me, what's the matter?

01:06:16.876 --> 01:06:18.835
I'm dying out here! Nothing else.

01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:22.418
The veins in my throat are bursting
from this terrible cough.

01:06:25.585 --> 01:06:27.460
I'll come in a day or two.

01:06:27.626 --> 01:06:30.168
Why don't you come directly to my funeral?

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.251
Are you a six year old?

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:35.210
I'll be there soon.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.585
Who was it?

01:06:46.293 --> 01:06:47.126
Work call.

01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:48.543
I have to go.

01:06:50.085 --> 01:06:51.043
Now'?

01:07:06.376 --> 01:07:08.043
Is everything okay?

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:11.710
Bye.

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:19.751
When will we meet next?

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.418
I'll call you.

01:07:31.543 --> 01:07:33.751
She's a lucky girl, Noor.

01:07:35.793 --> 01:07:38.085
She's totally going to love it.

01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:44.960
I'm heading out, Noor.

01:07:45.126 --> 01:07:47.168
There's a letter for you.
I'm keeping it here.

01:07:47.335 --> 01:07:48.085
Yes. Bye!

01:07:48.251 --> 01:07:49.126
Bye!

01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:03.793
Noor, I'm leaving.

01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.460
Actually, I've had to leave.

01:08:07.168 --> 01:08:08.668
Don't know when we will meet again.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:11.460
Or then, why did we have to meet at all?

01:08:12.335 --> 01:08:16.835
All I know is that, I'll always cherish
this time I spent with you.

01:08:18.585 --> 01:08:20.292
And yes, mother was asking about you.

01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:23.335
I lied to her that you have grown up.

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:26.335
Will we ever grow up, Noor?

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:30.167
Some things we cannot change
no matter how hard we try.

01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:33.585
And if they do,
we can't remain happy.

01:08:35.376 --> 01:08:37.126
I will pray for you, Noor.

01:08:38.376 --> 01:08:39.710
You're better than the best.

01:08:40.501 --> 01:08:42.167
Give it your all.

01:08:42.626 --> 01:08:44.167
Dazzle them with your shine.

01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:46.335
Your time is here.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:48.501
Goodbye, Noor!

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:51.626
We will meet again... if life permits.

01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:22.210
Hello.

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:24.460
Noor... my dear!

01:09:25.167 --> 01:09:28.710
Imagine, I had to hear from Jagirdar
that you have come to Srinagar.

01:09:28.876 --> 01:09:29.792
When are you coming home?

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.710
In a bit, I just have something
to take care of.

01:09:32.876 --> 01:09:35.126
Alright.
I'll see you in the evening.

01:09:35.292 --> 01:09:38.835
I want to hear all about the city.
Come quickly.

01:09:39.001 --> 01:09:41.001
Yes, Jun-jiju. I'll be there.

01:10:03.501 --> 01:10:05.085
Who's there?

01:10:06.043 --> 01:10:07.501
Who is it?

01:10:10.751 --> 01:10:11.918
Noor!

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:13.543
Greetings.

01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:16.918
I thought as much.

01:10:17.251 --> 01:10:21.585
Got homesick so soon in the city?

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:25.126
I was on my way home.
Thought I'd drop in to see you.

01:10:27.126 --> 01:10:30.335
Oh, so His Highness has come
to see the Begum.

01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:42.585
Did you meet Firdaus?

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:45.793
What did you think of her?

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.335
Isn't she precious?

01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:50.876
Noor's little princess.

01:10:53.793 --> 01:10:55.918
You've come to meet her,
haven't you?

01:10:58.376 --> 01:10:59.751
Call out to her.

01:11:02.876 --> 01:11:04.001
Call her.

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:09.085
Call her.

01:11:14.543 --> 01:11:15.710
Firdaus!

01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:18.293
Firdaus!

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:20.335
Careful, Noor.

01:11:21.835 --> 01:11:23.251
Bilal is coming.

01:11:26.793 --> 01:11:30.668
It's her own choice.
What could I've done?

01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:34.293
Hi, Noor. How are you?

01:11:34.918 --> 01:11:37.043
When did you get here?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.501
I'll catch up with you in a while.

01:11:41.626 --> 01:11:45.710
Come on mother.
It's peak afternoon.

01:11:45.876 --> 01:11:48.668
The doctor has asked you to rest.

01:11:48.835 --> 01:11:51.585
You came away just like that, Firdaus!

01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:55.293
I had to. That's how it is.

01:11:56.710 --> 01:12:01.126
Life goes on...
doesn't stop for anyone.

01:12:06.251 --> 01:12:08.335
But that's not done.

01:12:08.501 --> 01:12:11.251
One moment you blow hot,
the other, cold.

01:12:13.001 --> 01:12:14.501
What's your problem, Noor?

01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:16.585
Why have you come after me?

01:12:17.126 --> 01:12:18.793
What have you come to see?

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:21.626
Did I tell you to follow me
for the rest of your life?

01:12:21.793 --> 01:12:22.918
You are just too much!

01:12:25.168 --> 01:12:28.918
Mother, you need to stop smoking
that damn hookah.

01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:31.543
How will the medicines work?

01:12:33.501 --> 01:12:37.335
These merciless medicines
don't let me die easily.

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:41.085
Maybe opium will help.

01:12:46.085 --> 01:12:49.085
Noor, what will you do now?

01:12:49.418 --> 01:12:51.210
Are you going home?

01:12:52.585 --> 01:12:55.293
If you are, do me a favor.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:59.585
I owe Junaid some money
from last winter.

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:01.835
Some two thousand three hundred.

01:13:02.001 --> 01:13:03.876
Take it from Kaleem on your way out.

01:13:04.043 --> 01:13:05.543
- Move.
- Yes.

01:13:18.251 --> 01:13:22.126
Begum clenched her fist
and it was almost as if time stopped.

01:13:24.168 --> 01:13:26.710
What was I being punished for?

01:13:26.876 --> 01:13:29.543
Who had snuffed out all love
from this house?

01:13:33.126 --> 01:13:36.001
Whose story were we reliving?

01:13:57.585 --> 01:14:00.710
This smell of yours will drive me crazy.

01:14:00.876 --> 01:14:03.876
Enough! You'll jinx us now.

01:14:04.043 --> 01:14:05.876
Now hurry up and
show some of your magic

01:14:06.043 --> 01:14:09.126
or somebody will steal
this fragrance away.

01:14:17.126 --> 01:14:19.626
Look at this emerald.

01:14:20.835 --> 01:14:23.460
It'll look so lovely on you.

01:14:24.501 --> 01:14:27.668
Lord, how beautiful!

01:14:27.835 --> 01:14:31.210
Salman, how long are you here for?

01:14:31.376 --> 01:14:34.835
Father wanted to stay, but
he had to leave for the elections.

01:14:35.001 --> 01:14:39.043
I leave for London on Sunday
and from there to Islamabad.

01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:42.710
I would like to take Hazrat to London
for the trousseau shopping.

01:14:43.751 --> 01:14:46.210
Why don't you ask her yourself?

01:14:46.376 --> 01:14:49.001
Hazrat is too much of a free bird.

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:56.168
How long will we keep
meeting this way, Mufti?

01:14:57.251 --> 01:15:00.210
Who all will we lie to?

01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:06.543
I'm constantly worried
about getting caught.

01:15:11.585 --> 01:15:16.585
Things are tough, I know.
But we can't give up hope.

01:15:16.751 --> 01:15:21.460
Nobody can stop us
from getting married, Hazrat.

01:15:30.376 --> 01:15:35.001
- Hazrat will understand and
appreciate our choices.

01:15:36.293 --> 01:15:38.751
- Besides, she'll not be far away.

01:15:38.918 --> 01:15:42.418
- We'll get her married, but
how will you manage without her?

01:15:42.585 --> 01:15:47.335
- Salman will care for her like a princess.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:50.293
- We shouldn't delay
the marriage ceremony any more.

01:15:59.793 --> 01:16:01.043
Mufti!

01:16:02.876 --> 01:16:03.751
Mufti!

01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:11.085
Take care of this.

01:17:14.293 --> 01:17:15.126
Ticket.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.751
I'll get water. You wait here.

01:17:34.001 --> 01:17:36.001
Excuse me, my wife is sitting there...

01:17:36.168 --> 01:17:37.126
Please watch out for her,
I'll just go get some water.

01:17:37.293 --> 01:17:38.376
Sure.

01:18:18.168 --> 01:18:19.043
Mufti!

01:18:22.126 --> 01:18:23.001
Mufti!

01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:42.793
Hello.

01:19:43.376 --> 01:19:44.876
What date is it today, Noor?

01:19:45.043 --> 01:19:46.376
I need some more time, Leena
I'm working on it.

01:19:46.543 --> 01:19:47.710
The auction is in three days.

01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:49.210
Show me something.

01:19:49.376 --> 01:19:51.126
I'll call you when
I have something to show.

01:19:51.293 --> 01:19:53.168
Noor, it's one of Delhi's top art events...

01:20:15.876 --> 01:20:17.793
Why don't you answer it?

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.793
Somebody is really desperate out there.

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:24.001
It's been growling all day long.

01:20:25.085 --> 01:20:27.335
Don't talk nonsense.

01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:30.126
Just help me out. It's stuck.

01:20:31.876 --> 01:20:34.251
Who got stuck on you now?

01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:39.293
Mr. Minister,
do I smell something burning?

01:20:41.168 --> 01:20:44.418
For sure! Just look at you.

01:20:45.085 --> 01:20:47.085
You're the prettiest girl
in the world tonight.

01:20:47.668 --> 01:20:49.876
Someone's heart must surely be burning.

01:20:50.043 --> 01:20:54.543
Thank you, sire.
That was such a backhanded compliment.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.043
Now shall we get about
the rest of the evening?

01:20:59.210 --> 01:21:01.168
Everyone is waiting.

01:21:02.710 --> 01:21:05.251
Boundaries can separate countries,

01:21:05.418 --> 01:21:10.293
but they can't separate
our language, customs and traditions.

01:21:11.376 --> 01:21:13.210
We live in each other's hearts.

01:21:13.793 --> 01:21:18.210
And it's time now to welcome
each other in our homes.

01:21:18.376 --> 01:21:20.668
To embrace each other whole-heartedly.

01:21:22.126 --> 01:21:27.626
We enjoy your food,
you enjoy our ghazals.

01:21:28.626 --> 01:21:30.876
The circle of bonhomie will
only prosper.

01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:33.626
Just one last request.

01:21:34.876 --> 01:21:37.251
It's been 25 years since
the cricket match...

01:21:38.543 --> 01:21:41.710
please forgive Javed Miandad
for socking it to you.

01:21:45.085 --> 01:21:47.918
- And that was Bilal Latif,
the young and dynamic minister

01:21:48.085 --> 01:21:50.335
- from Pakistan speaking
at the Indo-Pak cultural summit - Roots.

01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:51.251
Please sit.

01:21:51.251 --> 01:21:52.001
Father...

01:21:52.418 --> 01:21:54.918
Mr. Shaikh, looking very good.

01:21:55.085 --> 01:21:57.335
Looks like India has grown on you.

01:21:57.835 --> 01:21:58.668
How are you, my dear?

01:21:58.835 --> 01:22:00.085
I'm fine.

01:22:00.251 --> 01:22:01.960
Mother wants to speak to you.

01:22:04.668 --> 01:22:09.418
Hazrat! This is not done.
You should've come.

01:22:09.585 --> 01:22:13.001
We've shut down parliament
to come here... and you...

01:22:14.210 --> 01:22:16.585
How many times will you disappoint me?

01:22:16.751 --> 01:22:19.460
When will I get a chance to host you?

01:22:19.626 --> 01:22:24.501
Salman, you are our guests.

01:22:25.376 --> 01:22:27.876
In fact, we are the ones
who must do the hosting.

01:22:28.043 --> 01:22:31.126
No one can win with you in words, Hazrat.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:35.876
Anyway, we shall settle with
your dearest jewel.

01:22:36.543 --> 01:22:39.085
Our Firdaus is looking like an angel.

01:22:39.251 --> 01:22:41.960
We should not delay
the marriage ceremony any more.

01:22:43.126 --> 01:22:44.835
Three crores in the center of the room

01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:46.001
with the gentleman...

01:22:46.001 --> 01:22:49.501
we have Shahzia Sikandar's
The World is Yours, The World is Mine

01:22:49.668 --> 01:22:50.751
at three crores.

01:22:50.918 --> 01:22:53.835
Fair warning, if we are all done,
I will sell.

01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:55.043
And... sold!

01:22:56.668 --> 01:22:58.001
May I have your paddle number, sir?

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.335
Slow down. We're up next.

01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:06.960
And now, ladies and gentlemen

01:23:07.126 --> 01:23:08.626
moving on to our next lot.

01:23:08.793 --> 01:23:13.210
Lot number 21, is by a new
upcoming Indian artist.

01:23:13.376 --> 01:23:15.251
His name is Noor Nizami.

01:23:15.418 --> 01:23:18.418
And the artwork is titled 'Scar Tissue'.

01:23:18.876 --> 01:23:21.793
I'll open the bidding at 17 lakhs.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.043
Seventeen lakhs, ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:27.710
Do I have any bids at 17 lakhs?

01:23:27.876 --> 01:23:31.043
Seventeen lakhs...
Fair warning... 17...

01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:34.085
Eighteen lakhs... we have
18 lakhs on my left.

01:23:34.251 --> 01:23:36.918
We are at 18 lakhs,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:23:37.085 --> 01:23:39.376
Anymore at 18 lakhs?

01:23:39.543 --> 01:23:41.835
Fair warning... I will sell.

01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:43.501
And... sold!

01:23:44.293 --> 01:23:47.543
To the gentleman on my left
at 18 lakhs.

01:23:51.085 --> 01:23:54.335
That brings us to the end of our auction,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:54.501 --> 01:23:57.251
Thank you all so much
for your generosity.

01:23:57.418 --> 01:24:01.210
And now I would like to introduce
our next act for the evening

01:24:01.376 --> 01:24:06.293
we have a performance
by a duet from India and Pakistan.

01:24:54.626 --> 01:24:55.668
Will you just excuse me for a minute?

01:24:55.835 --> 01:24:57.293
- A warm welcome to you all

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.251
- to the Indo-Pak Summit - Roots.

01:25:01.418 --> 01:25:04.376
- And now I present to you
the evening's special performance

01:25:04.543 --> 01:25:07.918
- dedicated to the people
of both our countries.

01:25:45.668 --> 01:25:49.543
Let there be an expression of love.

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:53.001
There's love buried deep within the heart.

01:25:53.168 --> 01:25:55.001
The heart beats alone.

01:25:55.168 --> 01:25:56.960
Alone.

01:25:57.126 --> 01:25:59.543
Heart to heart.

01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:03.585
Let there be an expression of love.

01:26:07.626 --> 01:26:11.585
Let there be an expression of love.

01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:13.543
Buried deep within the heart.

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:16.960
The heart beats alone.

01:26:17.126 --> 01:26:18.626
Alone.

01:26:34.710 --> 01:26:38.501
What's happened, Firdaus?
Don't you have anything to say to me?

01:26:39.585 --> 01:26:41.418
I've said what I had to, Noor.

01:26:47.793 --> 01:26:49.085
I love you.

01:26:51.126 --> 01:26:53.210
Don't be childish, Noor.

01:26:54.043 --> 01:26:55.585
You hardly know me.

01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:06.918
We were destined for just this much.

01:27:08.876 --> 01:27:11.168
Please let's just be grateful
for what we had.

01:27:12.501 --> 01:27:14.876
Is this like some dole you handed out?

01:27:17.168 --> 01:27:21.501
I love you, don't you get it?

01:27:21.668 --> 01:27:23.585
But I don't, Noor.

01:27:24.793 --> 01:27:26.793
I can't love like this.

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.335
What do you want?

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:32.751
That I leave all this?

01:27:32.918 --> 01:27:35.210
Come with you on your houseboat?

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:39.460
What will happen then?
Have you thought about it?

01:27:40.085 --> 01:27:42.251
Have you thought about anything at all?

01:27:43.876 --> 01:27:45.668
You are too much, Noor.

01:27:59.085 --> 01:28:01.126
I'm getting engaged in two days.

01:28:02.418 --> 01:28:04.293
Bilal will keep me happy-

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.835
We've been friends for years.
We understand each other.

01:28:10.001 --> 01:28:13.085
And I can't let a stupid mistake ruin this.

01:28:15.918 --> 01:28:19.418
What about love, Firdaus?

01:28:21.335 --> 01:28:22.876
Or is money everything?

01:28:24.251 --> 01:28:26.876
You know no one
can love you like I can.

01:28:27.043 --> 01:28:28.668
I don't want so much madness, Noor.

01:28:29.543 --> 01:28:31.168
And it's not about money.

01:28:31.335 --> 01:28:33.626
Marriage is between equals.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:38.793
Families are involved.
You won't understand.

01:28:39.918 --> 01:28:43.001
You won't understand anything
besides your love.

01:28:43.168 --> 01:28:46.085
Why are you lying to yourself, Firdaus?

01:28:48.543 --> 01:28:52.251
I have to go now.
I can't be missing for so long.

01:28:55.168 --> 01:28:56.543
Please, Firdaus.

01:28:58.626 --> 01:29:05.918
Why are we standing so far away
From each other?

01:29:06.626 --> 01:29:08.460
In your breath.

01:29:08.626 --> 01:29:10.460
And in mine.

01:29:10.626 --> 01:29:13.585
We breath the same air.

01:29:14.001 --> 01:29:16.418
I will die.

01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:20.168
Don't leave me so.

01:29:22.626 --> 01:29:26.460
Let there be an expression of love.

01:29:26.626 --> 01:29:28.501
There's love buried deep within the heart.

01:29:28.668 --> 01:29:31.918
The heart beats alone.

01:29:32.085 --> 01:29:33.793
Alone.

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.251
- Arif.
- Yes?

01:29:35.418 --> 01:29:36.460
Heart to heart.

01:29:36.626 --> 01:29:38.793
Let there be an expression of love.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:39.876
Noon“.

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.585
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.

01:29:43.168 --> 01:29:44.668
No. Not yet.

01:29:45.793 --> 01:29:47.585
In a bit.

01:29:48.001 --> 01:29:51.293
Noor, we've spent too much time here.

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.418
Let's go somewhere else.

01:29:59.668 --> 01:30:00.710
Hang on.

01:30:02.043 --> 01:30:03.251
I'll just go meet Firdaus and come.

01:30:03.418 --> 01:30:04.251
Noon“.

01:30:05.085 --> 01:30:06.043
Let her go.

01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:10.876
Which part of this don't you understand?

01:30:12.085 --> 01:30:13.960
It's not that she lied to you.

01:30:15.626 --> 01:30:18.126
I know... I know...
but these people are like this.

01:30:18.293 --> 01:30:20.918
She is the Begum's daughter after all.

01:30:21.085 --> 01:30:23.210
They don't care for anyone.

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:26.293
They will swallow you whole
and you won't even know it.

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:27.418
Get out of all this.

01:30:27.585 --> 01:30:28.876
Don't screw up your career.

01:30:35.376 --> 01:30:39.085
You've been a good friend.
I'll never forget that.

01:30:39.251 --> 01:30:42.835
Now go home.
Don't give me your advice.

01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:45.293
You can go shove it.

01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:48.918
To hell with you,
your Leena and my future.

01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:56.293
Bro, give me a drink.

01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:19.793
Noor, my dear, what a talented artist
you are turning out to be!

01:31:25.293 --> 01:31:27.043
Noor, what the hell is wrong with you!

01:31:27.043 --> 01:31:28.960
You are completely out of your...

01:31:31.168 --> 01:31:32.251
Firdaus!

01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:45.335
Excuse me...

01:31:46.668 --> 01:31:47.668
No, sir... don't.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.043
Please, sir, stand back.

01:32:00.418 --> 01:32:02.543
If you ask for milk,
we will give you pudding!

01:32:02.543 --> 01:32:05.085
But if you ask for Kashmir,
we will give you a thrashing!

01:32:05.793 --> 01:32:07.460
If you ask for milk,
we will give you pudding!

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:09.626
But if you ask for Kashmir,
we will give you a thrashing!

01:32:21.126 --> 01:32:24.418
Such a bright chap... gone!

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.460
You can't get drunk
and create a ruckus

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.001
at this kind of a
high profile event!

01:32:32.085 --> 01:32:33.085
Take him away!

01:32:39.043 --> 01:32:41.418
Lock him up for the night.

01:32:41.876 --> 01:32:44.251
A thrashing will bring him
to his senses.

01:32:49.876 --> 01:32:52.001
You should have kept him in check.

01:32:53.293 --> 01:32:56.501
Was it necessary to bring it down to this?

01:32:59.835 --> 01:33:02.543
Whatever happened in the past,

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:05.335
I have no interest in digging into it.

01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:13.418
But your future is mine and mine alone.

01:33:18.043 --> 01:33:19.210
Isn't it?

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.835
Isn't it?

01:33:31.918 --> 01:33:33.251
Nizami!

01:33:34.251 --> 01:33:35.960
You got bail.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:39.293
Take him with you too.

01:33:39.293 --> 01:33:41.626
He's been sitting here
for two whole days.

01:33:41.626 --> 01:33:43.543
Mad family!

01:34:00.751 --> 01:34:02.543
Let's go home, Jun-jiju.

01:34:05.251 --> 01:34:07.168
I did what I had to.

01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:09.751
Here, drink this.

01:34:11.085 --> 01:34:12.418
Cool down.

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:16.751
I've ruined everything.

01:34:18.335 --> 01:34:19.543
I had lost my mind.

01:34:25.626 --> 01:34:28.210
I only thought about myself

01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:31.376
and this great love of mine!

01:34:38.210 --> 01:34:39.960
Forgive me, Jun-jiju!

01:34:42.793 --> 01:34:44.001
Don't cry.

01:34:44.168 --> 01:34:45.918
Everything will work out.

01:34:56.626 --> 01:34:58.626
This was my mother's prized possession.

01:35:00.501 --> 01:35:03.418
I've cared for it like a baby.

01:35:18.085 --> 01:35:21.210
You need to forget about
what happened in Delhi, Firdaus.

01:35:22.126 --> 01:35:24.085
That story is now over.

01:35:25.501 --> 01:35:28.210
Now you are going to become
someone else possession.

01:35:31.668 --> 01:35:34.085
What will I do being
someone else possession?

01:35:36.335 --> 01:35:38.751
Hang around their neck my entire life?

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.418
Don't be crazy, Firdaus.

01:35:43.210 --> 01:35:45.501
You don't know what you are saying.

01:35:46.501 --> 01:35:50.751
I know, I should do what is right.

01:35:53.376 --> 01:35:56.376
I know... I know it all.

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:59.626
I have been hearing all of this
since I was a child.

01:36:03.001 --> 01:36:05.085
But my heart feels otherwise.

01:36:08.293 --> 01:36:10.293
Something is not right.

01:36:14.293 --> 01:36:18.293
Tell me mother...
what should I do?

01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:20.960
Don't worry my doll.

01:36:21.251 --> 01:36:23.043
I was your age once.

01:36:24.918 --> 01:36:27.835
I had also got swept up
in all these emotions.

01:36:28.793 --> 01:36:30.376
What did I get in return?

01:36:33.085 --> 01:36:35.793
Do you want to live my life, Firdaus?

01:36:37.585 --> 01:36:40.751
It's not necessary that
what happened with you

01:36:40.751 --> 01:36:42.251
will happen to me.

01:36:43.585 --> 01:36:45.126
Yes, of course...

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:48.251
It's not necessary at all.

01:36:49.168 --> 01:36:52.251
Anyway what wrong
has ever happened with you?

01:36:52.251 --> 01:36:54.418
You are a fortunate one.

01:36:54.835 --> 01:36:58.210
How else would an orphan
ever become the pride of this palace?

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.376
Is it necessary to remind me
again and again, mother?

01:37:03.376 --> 01:37:05.168
Yes, it is, Firdaus.

01:37:07.585 --> 01:37:12.043
I had thought that God had sent
you to me for a special purpose.

01:37:13.001 --> 01:37:15.418
I protected you from everyone.

01:37:17.043 --> 01:37:18.835
You were special.

01:37:27.168 --> 01:37:29.960
You are still special, my doll.

01:37:30.668 --> 01:37:33.793
You've not been made to
waste away in love.

01:37:34.501 --> 01:37:41.126
This palace now needs a man,
a name, a title.

01:37:45.876 --> 01:37:49.251
And now you are going to bring
back that lost splendor.

01:37:51.043 --> 01:37:54.126
We can't be out on the streets again.

01:37:54.751 --> 01:37:57.543
Neither you, nor I.

01:38:00.501 --> 01:38:02.293
Please get dressed soon.

01:38:04.418 --> 01:38:06.543
Bilal will be here any moment.

01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:27.751
Congratulations!

01:38:27.751 --> 01:38:29.918
Be blessed!

01:38:41.501 --> 01:38:45.668
Praise the Lord,
stay happy you both.

01:38:49.835 --> 01:38:52.793
Aunt Nargis, drop the spoons
and dig into it with your hands!

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.210
You won't become fat.

01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:55.085
Rascal!

01:38:56.793 --> 01:38:59.710
Kaleem, please feed him some meatballs.

01:39:07.710 --> 01:39:10.293
So many years have gone by

01:39:10.293 --> 01:39:12.460
you still haven't been able to forget her.

01:39:14.043 --> 01:39:18.918
Dear, the heart moves in mysterious ways.

01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:24.126
He who hasn't felt that yearning,
has not lived at all.

01:39:26.418 --> 01:39:29.376
It's truly a blessing to be in love!

01:39:29.376 --> 01:39:34.293
As time passes,
it only gets stronger.

01:39:59.668 --> 01:40:03.293
Pure, beautiful, soulful.

01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:08.960
I may be cursed like that.

01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:12.751
That the heart yearns for
what once was.

01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:15.043
Those sweet fragrant days of my past.

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.501
London's my last chance.

01:41:25.501 --> 01:41:27.668
Will you come along?

01:41:27.668 --> 01:41:30.293
I don't have the strength
to do this alone.

01:41:32.543 --> 01:41:33.626
Arif?

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.668
Should I do push ups for you?

01:41:44.543 --> 01:41:46.626
Give me 50 right now.

01:42:09.668 --> 01:42:13.335
Let me show you the gallery
and the space for your exhibition.

01:42:22.710 --> 01:42:25.251
And here is the outdoor space
for your exhibition.

01:42:25.251 --> 01:42:27.918
I hope it's inspiring enough!

01:42:39.001 --> 01:42:41.460
So 30 meters... we can't go wrong
with that. Alright?

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.793
Just measure it
and come back and tell me.

01:42:43.793 --> 01:42:44.918
Sure.

01:42:45.585 --> 01:42:48.626
Congratulations...
we made it to the London Time Out.

01:43:34.751 --> 01:43:37.251
This is centre stage!
London, isn't it?

01:43:37.751 --> 01:43:41.043
There is something very interesting
about the way he thinks.

01:43:41.043 --> 01:43:43.085
The way he articulates his expression.

01:43:56.501 --> 01:43:59.335
What could be macabre for one

01:43:59.335 --> 01:44:01.668
could be freedom for someone else.

01:44:16.001 --> 01:44:20.293
Noor, my child...
you disappeared again!

01:44:20.293 --> 01:44:23.793
Now I have to meet you in
this foreign city.

01:44:23.793 --> 01:44:26.710
When Jagirdar told me,
I couldn't keep myself from coming.

01:44:28.126 --> 01:44:30.751
Firdaus sent these flowers
for your big day.

01:44:33.376 --> 01:44:35.043
Oh my God!

01:44:45.793 --> 01:44:48.335
You were always a good artisan

01:44:49.168 --> 01:44:52.085
but now you have truly
bloomed into an artist!

01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:56.210
There is depth in your work now.

01:44:58.418 --> 01:45:00.085
Good show, Noor!

01:45:02.501 --> 01:45:04.751
Somebody smashed your heart big time!

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:10.543
You have poured out everything,
you must be all empty now.

01:45:12.585 --> 01:45:14.751
You must be feeling naked.

01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:17.918
Noor... over here!

01:45:59.668 --> 01:46:01.376
Begum!

01:46:03.085 --> 01:46:05.585
Begum...
Firdaus didn't come?

01:46:06.585 --> 01:46:09.210
Firdaus! Firdaus!

01:46:11.168 --> 01:46:13.460
I came...
doesn't that mean anything?

01:46:13.876 --> 01:46:15.460
Go inside, Noor.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:18.293
This is the biggest day of your life.

01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:21.876
Forget everything else.

01:46:25.710 --> 01:46:27.043
Begum!

01:46:42.543 --> 01:46:46.126
Noor Nizami... Artist.

01:46:48.376 --> 01:46:51.460
Don't worry.
Jagirdar has sent me.

01:46:52.251 --> 01:46:53.960
Come, I'll drop you home.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:56.460
No. I want to be alone.

01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:58.043
We are all alone.

01:46:58.585 --> 01:47:01.001
Come. Have a drink with me.

01:47:03.710 --> 01:47:06.085
Come on, sir.

01:47:06.085 --> 01:47:09.210
Will treat you to
London's best Kashmiri tea.

01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:10.126
Come.

01:47:27.876 --> 01:47:29.126
Noor Nizami.

01:47:30.085 --> 01:47:33.751
That runt of a boy who used to
ride a boat on the Dal Lake.

01:47:34.501 --> 01:47:35.918
Look at him today.

01:47:37.043 --> 01:47:39.001
The rising star of the art world!

01:47:40.793 --> 01:47:42.335
Have we met before?

01:47:48.376 --> 01:47:49.751
I swear to God.

01:47:52.043 --> 01:47:54.126
I will tear you apart.

01:47:56.668 --> 01:47:57.710
Muazzam!

01:48:00.335 --> 01:48:03.293
Nowadays, I am known by the
name of Mirza Baig.

01:48:03.793 --> 01:48:05.210
What do you want from me?

01:48:06.085 --> 01:48:07.543
Jagirdar? - Yes.

01:48:08.585 --> 01:48:10.793
I had sent Jagirdar to you.

01:48:13.835 --> 01:48:16.918
Your arts scholarship is
standing in front of you.

01:48:17.085 --> 01:48:20.876
IIC Delhi...
The Gallery of Modern Art.

01:48:23.918 --> 01:48:25.876
The exhibition at the Aman.

01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:32.751
The Freedom Series.

01:48:39.168 --> 01:48:41.335
All your show-stoppers!

01:48:41.501 --> 01:48:43.543
I picked up all of them.

01:48:46.501 --> 01:48:48.376
I doubled your price overnight.

01:48:51.668 --> 01:48:52.668
Lies!

01:48:54.918 --> 01:48:56.960
After what happened in Delhi,

01:48:57.126 --> 01:49:00.293
I had great difficulty convincing
the London organizers.

01:49:05.876 --> 01:49:06.751
Why?

01:49:08.168 --> 01:49:09.960
I had two sons your age.

01:49:12.085 --> 01:49:14.001
My jihad ate them up.

01:49:15.501 --> 01:49:18.793
Neither did I get freedom, nor death.

01:49:19.793 --> 01:49:22.418
I came here under a different name.

01:49:23.376 --> 01:49:24.960
Worked night and day.

01:49:25.126 --> 01:49:26.751
And built all this from scratch.

01:49:27.335 --> 01:49:29.001
But away from my country.

01:49:29.585 --> 01:49:31.585
I couldn't forget that boy

01:49:31.751 --> 01:49:33.751
who risked it all
to bring me a warm coat.

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.668
The thought of that coat
kept me warm many a night.

01:49:41.793 --> 01:49:44.668
Today when everyone in the gallery
were singing your praises

01:49:44.835 --> 01:49:47.501
I had tears in my eyes!

01:49:48.585 --> 01:49:52.543
Noor, my boy. We did it!

01:49:56.043 --> 01:50:00.168
We? This is all about you.

01:50:03.168 --> 01:50:05.210
Did anyone ever ask me what I wanted?

01:50:05.626 --> 01:50:07.335
Don't be upset, Noor!

01:50:08.085 --> 01:50:09.918
At least not today.

01:50:13.168 --> 01:50:14.418
Today?

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.585
Today you've reduced me to nothing!

01:50:19.418 --> 01:50:21.751
Today, I don't even know who I am.

01:50:22.418 --> 01:50:25.210
Am I even worth anything?

01:50:25.876 --> 01:50:27.543
Why did you do all this?

01:50:29.085 --> 01:50:30.918
Who told you to do all this?

01:50:31.085 --> 01:50:33.376
You can't just play God as you please.

01:50:35.418 --> 01:50:38.043
Screw your charity!

01:50:38.210 --> 01:50:41.001
I don't want it... don't want it!

01:50:55.668 --> 01:50:58.876
No matter how hard you run
your past does not forget you.

01:51:02.293 --> 01:51:03.876
It follows you like your shadow.

01:51:04.043 --> 01:51:06.668
You are now going to be
part of this legacy.

01:51:06.835 --> 01:51:09.918
Your new life starts from today.
God bless you!

01:51:10.251 --> 01:51:12.835
For better or for worse

01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:14.751
I will always be that boy from the Dal.

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:16.210
Little Noora!

01:51:16.376 --> 01:51:18.376
To be deserving of Firdaus

01:51:18.543 --> 01:51:20.168
you have to become someone.

01:51:20.418 --> 01:51:23.335
Presenting... man of the hour
Noor Nizami!

01:51:24.335 --> 01:51:29.001
My whole life was a lie... a conspiracy.

01:51:54.501 --> 01:51:56.710
Why did you lie to me?

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:04.168
Why did you say that if
I want to win over Firdaus

01:52:04.335 --> 01:52:06.043
I need to become someone?

01:52:10.168 --> 01:52:12.251
Why did you make me feel

01:52:12.418 --> 01:52:14.501
that you are making me
worthy of her?

01:52:14.668 --> 01:52:17.251
You thought whatever you had to.

01:52:17.418 --> 01:52:20.043
I never promised you anything.

01:52:21.585 --> 01:52:25.251
Your thoughts always got ahead of you.

01:52:30.501 --> 01:52:31.626
My thoughts?

01:52:32.876 --> 01:52:34.751
And what you did was nothing?

01:52:36.210 --> 01:52:38.001
All this was a game for you.

01:52:39.793 --> 01:52:42.543
You laid my heart out
and played dice on it.

01:52:45.585 --> 01:52:46.960
And Firdaus?

01:52:47.710 --> 01:52:49.626
You should have at least
thought about her?

01:52:50.626 --> 01:52:52.085
Don't you dare take her name.

01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:58.960
When I saw you for the first time

01:52:59.335 --> 01:53:01.001
I knew right away.

01:53:02.710 --> 01:53:04.501
That same attitude

01:53:04.668 --> 01:53:06.918
that same insolent stare.

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:12.043
I knew that you would strike
when the opportunity arose.

01:53:17.501 --> 01:53:19.501
But not this time...

01:53:22.210 --> 01:53:23.793
not this time, Mufti.

01:53:25.126 --> 01:53:28.585
I have kept Firdaus' heart
locked up in my coffer.

01:53:29.501 --> 01:53:31.543
It's invaluable.

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:36.626
People of your ilk
can't even glance at her.

01:53:38.043 --> 01:53:41.293
She is getting married to Bilal.

01:53:51.626 --> 01:53:54.668
- Can you feel it? It's broken.
- Yes!

01:53:58.376 --> 01:54:01.418
And now you take these broken pieces

01:54:02.085 --> 01:54:04.001
and mend it all your life.

01:54:08.293 --> 01:54:10.460
Why did you betray me?

01:54:12.585 --> 01:54:14.751
Where did my love fall short?

01:54:18.293 --> 01:54:21.293
Now you will know, Mufti

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.001
how it feels when the heart breaks.

01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:29.960
How a living throbbing life
comes to a complete stand still.

01:54:30.835 --> 01:54:32.085
Now you will know!

01:54:34.710 --> 01:54:39.251
No, father! No!

01:54:39.418 --> 01:54:41.501
No, father... my child!

01:54:42.210 --> 01:54:47.043
My Child Will die!

01:54:48.918 --> 01:54:51.960
No, father!

01:54:57.626 --> 01:55:00.335
My child will die.

01:55:41.043 --> 01:55:43.126
Come!

01:55:44.085 --> 01:55:47.251
Let her go. Forgive her!

01:55:47.418 --> 01:55:49.501
Move aside.

01:55:50.043 --> 01:55:52.876
Please don't do this.

01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:55.210
She made a mistake. Let her go.

01:55:55.668 --> 01:55:57.876
She's your daughter!

01:55:58.043 --> 01:56:00.710
We raised a whore for our daughter!

01:56:00.876 --> 01:56:03.960
She has stripped me
in front of the whole world.

01:56:04.335 --> 01:56:05.543
Drop that phone!

01:56:06.501 --> 01:56:08.335
No doctor will come to this house.

01:56:08.918 --> 01:56:11.876
Let her rot along with her goddamn child!

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.210
Mother...

01:57:17.543 --> 01:57:19.335
Your child is a girl.

01:57:48.543 --> 01:57:49.960
Madam.

01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:04.460
Firdaus.

01:58:14.793 --> 01:58:15.793
Noon“.

01:58:28.293 --> 01:58:29.251
Noor!

01:58:33.501 --> 01:58:34.918
Firdaus.

01:59:14.293 --> 01:59:16.793
If I'm destined to ruin.

01:59:18.085 --> 01:59:19.001
I accept.

01:59:20.043 --> 01:59:22.460
If this is how it has to end

01:59:24.085 --> 01:59:25.168
then I accept.

01:59:26.293 --> 01:59:29.001
I accept! I accept! I accept!

02:00:10.210 --> 02:00:18.668
Prayer for the departed.

02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:28.793
Child.

02:01:36.626 --> 02:01:38.710
It was an accident, dear.

02:01:41.210 --> 02:01:43.335
Don't curse yourself so much.

02:01:46.501 --> 02:01:49.293
It will take time but we will
try to get through this.

02:01:53.501 --> 02:01:57.793
Let's complete the rituals
and head to Islamabad.

02:02:00.585 --> 02:02:03.210
Noor had come to meet mother.

02:02:05.251 --> 02:02:07.085
I need to see him.

02:02:07.251 --> 02:02:08.335
What?

02:02:08.501 --> 02:02:10.001
Noor...

02:02:10.168 --> 02:02:11.293
I want to meet him.

02:02:12.585 --> 02:02:14.418
Your mother just passed away.

02:02:14.585 --> 02:02:16.876
People are saying all sorts of things.

02:02:17.043 --> 02:02:19.168
And you still haven't
come to your senses, Firdaus?

02:02:19.335 --> 02:02:20.751
Didn't I warn you?

02:02:20.918 --> 02:02:22.876
No more beyond this... that's it!

02:02:23.043 --> 02:02:24.335
Didn't I?

02:02:27.293 --> 02:02:30.168
Don't make the same mistake
that your mother made.

02:02:35.126 --> 02:02:39.960
I am not my father who'll bow down
all my life and pine away.

02:02:52.710 --> 02:02:56.585
It doesn't let go even when you die.

02:02:58.043 --> 02:02:59.543
Love...

02:03:00.668 --> 02:03:03.043
Love is a strange beast.

02:03:03.210 --> 02:03:07.876
You can whip it, starve it,
push it deep down in your insides.

02:03:08.043 --> 02:03:10.335
But you can't pull it out of you.

02:03:14.335 --> 02:03:16.876
If your heart knows where it belongs

02:03:17.418 --> 02:03:19.918
you'll fight with the
whole world to get there.

02:03:29.793 --> 02:03:31.876
A wise man once said

02:03:32.043 --> 02:03:34.543
it's truly a blessing to be in love.

02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:37.085
Let it possess you.

02:03:37.251 --> 02:03:39.751
Without fear, without shame.

02:03:39.918 --> 02:03:41.626
Without thought.

02:03:41.918 --> 02:03:44.168
Love in itself is its own reward.

02:03:44.460 --> 02:03:46.085
No one wins, no one loses.

02:04:34.835 --> 02:04:36.293
Noor!

02:04:38.876 --> 02:04:39.918
Noor!

02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:57.793
Will you stop staring, Noor?
