13:24.803 --> 13:26.639
Ew! It's wet.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.390
Where's that

13:28.474 --> 13:30.518
-(GASPS) The book!
-The book?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.400
I feel it. The book is here.

13:42.821 --> 13:45.115
-You!
-You know them?

13:45.199 --> 13:47.159
Just hand the book over
and nobody gets hurt.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.286
I don't know how
you do things in the ocean,

13:49.370 --> 13:51.580
but we don't negotiate
with villains.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.500
Good. I wanted to do it
the hard way.

Get them, Mera.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.792
Mera, see, one of their boats.
Used to pillage the ocean.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.460
We must get
that book from them.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.921
-I need more water.
-Then find it!

They got away.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.241
And they got
the Book of Legends.

16:34.201 --> 16:38.789
Siren and Mera, ocean natives,
and Super Hero High's
most wanted.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.710
Katana, Bumblebee, we're gonna
need waterproof super-suits.

-Yeah, honey!

16:59.351 --> 17:01.937
Oh, I haven't seen anything
so groundbreaking

17:02.020 --> 17:03.230
since the first super hero

17:03.313 --> 17:05.816
wore his underpants
on the outside.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.527
And what are you

17:08.610 --> 17:11.405
-Cape making.
-And utility belt construction.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.282
A hero must
always have her tools.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.952
It's a whole new you.
Two whole new yous.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.466
No sign of Mera or Siren.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.926
We need to find them
before they cause more trouble.

I'll make something that can.

HAWKGIRL: According to
Wonder Woman's intel,

17:54.114 --> 17:57.159
our suspects
are after a magic trident.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.994
The Trident controls the ocean,

17:59.077 --> 18:00.370
and is held by the ruler

18:00.454 --> 18:02.498
of a legendary underwater city
called Atlantis.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.083
(SCOFFS) No way. I've been
exploring the ocean

18:05.167 --> 18:07.920
since I was a tadpole
and I've never seen any city.

18:08.003 --> 18:11.632
Ancient lore says it's cloaked
like Wonder Woman's Themyscira.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.425
You have to know
where to find it.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.260
The power of that trident
could take down

18:15.344 --> 18:16.595
all of the surface world.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.180
If Mera and Siren are after it,

18:18.263 --> 18:20.599
we need to find Atlantis
and warn their King.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.685
Right, but the best way
to protect Atlantis, Metropolis,

18:23.769 --> 18:24.853
and the rest of the world

18:24.937 --> 18:27.272
is to find Mera
and Siren first.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.275
Supergirl and Batgirl,
you should search for Atlantis.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.693
The rest of us
will try to track them

18:31.777 --> 18:33.821
and cut them off
before they get there.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.367
Good luck, heroes.

on your boat, Captain Katana.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.677

Hey, Frost. How's it going?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.018
Can I get you anything?
I brought snacks.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.188

19:08.272 --> 19:10.399

to create something

19:10.482 --> 19:13.026

its constituent elements,

19:13.110 --> 19:14.736
namely, hydrogen and oxygen,

19:14.820 --> 19:18.407
and render it uncontrollable
by Mera's hydrokinetic powers.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.287
So, is that a yes
to the gazpacho?

19:25.831 --> 19:29.084

to flying, balance was tricky.

did the Atlantians
try to help us?

I don't wanna be your friend.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.559
I can admit,

28:06.643 --> 28:08.770
I'm not everyone's

28:48.601 --> 28:50.770

We could have

57:17.016 --> 57:18.726
Oops, sorry.

57:18.810 --> 57:20.478
I got it. I have a plan.

57:31.156 --> 57:33.324

58:11.070 --> 58:13.072
The oxygen pack.
They broke it.

58:13.156 --> 58:14.657
I better get back
to the surface.

58:14.741 --> 58:15.950
You have to fight without me.

58:16.034 --> 58:17.452
No way.

58:17.535 --> 58:20.246
It's not over for you until
you make Siren sing.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.289
Here.

58:21.372 --> 58:22.916
But what about you?

58:22.999 --> 58:24.584
Do you even have enough air
to get back to the surface?

58:24.667 --> 58:25.668
I think I can help.

58:25.752 --> 58:27.337
Bumblebee, when you're small

58:27.420 --> 58:29.088
you don't need
much oxygen, right?

58:29.172 --> 58:31.216
Shrink and I'll make
an oxygen bubble for you.

Okay. Bubble me.

You can't stop me.
I'm more powerful now.

-Give up. You've lost.
-Never.

1:01:18.841 --> 1:01:20.426

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:38.111
I have the trident.

1:01:38.194 --> 1:01:40.113
Please, Siren. I forgive you.

1:01:40.196 --> 1:01:42.198
There's still time
to do the right thing.

1:01:42.281 --> 1:01:43.866
The right thing?

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:45.743
That ship has sailed.

1:01:45.827 --> 1:01:48.121
Not another step!

1:01:53.626 --> 1:01:56.129
or my own sister
who insisted on saving her?

1:01:56.212 --> 1:02:00.299
Do you really think that you,
with your weak walking legs,

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:03.469
could have made it
out of my ocean?

1:02:03.553 --> 1:02:06.556
My own sister dragged you
to the surface.

1:02:06.639 --> 1:02:09.559
She even dared touch
her feet on the shore,

1:02:09.642 --> 1:02:12.145
waiting for your
inferior human lungs

1:02:12.228 --> 1:02:14.730
to gasp the putrid surface air.

Greater than this super hero.

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:20.671

1:03:50.868 --> 1:03:52.578
your restraints
with my electric sting.

1:03:52.662 --> 1:03:55.414
One flick of the trident

1:03:55.498 --> 1:03:58.209
this whole palace
if I wanted to.

1:04:03.673 --> 1:04:05.341
I can't let you do this.

Bumblebee, don't do it.
There has to be another way.

I won't let Siren
sink Metropolis.

you to another dimension.

is pretty good,

you'll never be
as powerful as me.

And flowers. I bet
you can't create a flower.

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:27.632
Of course I can create flowers.

1:05:27.715 --> 1:05:30.426
I can create flowers
much better than yours.

that whirlpool going

Finally, a place
where I belong.

1:11:14.853 --> 1:11:18.273
So don't be weird about it,
but I got you something.

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:22.236
Me? Weird? Never!

1:11:22.319 --> 1:11:24.488
(CHANTING INCANTATION)

1:11:25.447 --> 1:11:27.366
Aw, you shouldn't have.

1:11:27.449 --> 1:11:28.742
(SNIFFING)

1:11:28.826 --> 1:11:30.703
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

1:11:32.121 --> 1:11:35.040
You're right. Pranking is fun.

1:11:35.124 --> 1:11:36.583
(LAUGHING)

1:11:43.173 --> 1:11:45.718
HARLEY: Ha! Nice going, gothy.

1:11:45.801 --> 1:11:49.471
RAVEN: You're my inspiration
Laughs-alot McPranky pants.

1:11:53.225 --> 1:11:54.727
Vice Principal Grodd,

1:11:54.810 --> 1:11:58.063
put that cursed book
where no one will ever find it.
