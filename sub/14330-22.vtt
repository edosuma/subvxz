09:02.875 --> 09:04.627
That's right, Timmy.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.838
According to the rules,
every 450 years,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.465
each godparent must get
their license renewed

09:09.548 --> 09:12.218
at the godparent academy.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.637
{\an1}As you can see,
ours are due to expire.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.890
You mean I'll be godparentless?

09:17.974 --> 09:19.934
Just for a little while, Sugar.

09:20.017 --> 09:20.893
In the meantime--

09:21.269 --> 09:23.271
{\an1}We've contacted
the fairy godparent agency

09:23.354 --> 09:25.731
and they'll be sending over
a replacement any minute.

09:25.815 --> 09:26.983
(knocking on door)

09:27.066 --> 09:28.985
(gasps)
It's almost like I'm psychic!

09:31.153 --> 09:32.947
Agency sent me.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.157
Cool! Another magic dude!

09:35.241 --> 09:36.409
What's your cool magic name?

09:36.492 --> 09:37.994
Voltron?
Captain Zapula?

09:38.077 --> 09:38.911
Mesmero?

09:39.620 --> 09:40.830
I'm Jeff. Don't touch the bell.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.499
You seem a bit short
to be a godparent.

09:43.582 --> 09:44.458
Look, I've got the wings,
I've got the wand.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.543
What more do you want?

09:45.626 --> 09:47.378
All right, you guys.
You can go.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.130
But hurry back.

09:49.588 --> 09:50.464
Ok, Timmy.

09:50.548 --> 09:50.881

09:55.303 --> 09:57.263
{\an1}Well, now that Mr. and
Mrs. Hilarious are gone,

09:57.638 --> 09:58.931

09:59.015 --> 10:00.224
{\an1}My treat.

10:00.308 --> 10:02.351
Wait, you're supposed to
grant my wishes, remember?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.311
Oh, yeah, right,
I'm a godparent.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.438
Ok, what do you want?

10:05.521 --> 10:06.105
Hmm.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.189
How about a new toy?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.025

10:09.817 --> 10:10.443

(ding)

10:11.610 --> 10:12.320
Cool!

10:12.653 --> 10:13.612
Yeah, uh, toys are my specialty.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.865
How about we go to the beach?

10:15.948 --> 10:16.949
That'll be fun.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.200
Okey, dokey.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.036

10:20.995 --> 10:21.996
Knock yourself out, kid.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.622
A lousy pail and shovel.

10:23.998 --> 10:24.832
What's the deal?

10:25.082 --> 10:26.125
Yeah, well, uh,

10:26.542 --> 10:28.336
you know how crowded the beach
is this time of year.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.712
Uh, just get in the bathtub

10:29.795 --> 10:31.422

10:31.756 --> 10:33.174

imagination, Jimmy.

Ah, the godparent academy!

10:52.485 --> 10:53.486
Well, it shouldn't be too bad.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.446
{\an1}We just take a couple
of easy tests

10:55.529 --> 10:57.948

10:58.324 --> 10:59.533
No sweat.

Welcome to the Fairy Academy.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.842
I am drill sergeant
Jorgen Von Strangle

11:17.093 --> 11:17.802
and these are my muscles.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.391
I really should
start working out.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.684
I am here to make men
out of all of you.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.727
Even the women?

11:26.811 --> 11:27.353
Yes.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.438
So, you're a fairy godparent?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.272
Uh, well,
where are your wings?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.900
Too girly, jet pack.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.781
Uh, well then,
where's your magic wand?

11:38.864 --> 11:39.907
Too wimpy.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.075
I have this now.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.078
Any more questions?

11:45.579 --> 11:47.790
Now, we go on the 5,000 mile run

11:47.873 --> 11:49.750
through the desert
of broken glass.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.794
Go now!

11:53.045 --> 11:53.129
(chomping)

11:54.630 --> 11:55.214
{\an3}Hey!

11:55.965 --> 11:57.508
Aren't you supposed to be
doing some magic.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.760
Hey, I changed the channel
without getting up, didn't I?

11:59.844 --> 12:01.846
Duh! You used the remote.

12:02.263 --> 12:02.972
{\an1}Ok, ok.
What do you want?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.056
How about a chocolate shake?

12:05.724 --> 12:06.267
(burps)

12:06.350 --> 12:06.392

12:07.852 --> 12:09.895

12:10.521 --> 12:12.606

12:13.149 --> 12:14.400
Yeah, well, uh,

12:14.483 --> 12:17.027
it's a milk
jack-in-the-shake-box.

12:17.111 --> 12:17.945
{\an1}Uh, shake.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.321
(slurping)

12:19.405 --> 12:20.906
Ah, thanks for the shake, kid.

12:21.198 --> 12:21.907
I was parched.

12:21.991 --> 12:22.575
Don't mention it.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.078
How about a new robot
computer game?

12:26.537 --> 12:28.289
I don't know much
about computers but...

12:28.664 --> 12:29.039
here goes.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.167
What's this?

12:31.417 --> 12:33.002
Uh, well. It's a robot, see,

12:33.085 --> 12:34.044
and it, uh...

12:34.128 --> 12:35.504
fits into the computer
like this.

12:35.754 --> 12:36.046
Voila!

12:37.590 --> 12:38.674
Oh, great!

12:38.757 --> 12:40.009
Can you at least
make a fire extinguisher?

12:41.927 --> 12:42.386

12:43.762 --> 12:46.015
We're doomed, aren't we?

12:46.307 --> 12:47.057
{\an1}Uh, yeah?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.560
As a reward for doing so well,

12:49.643 --> 12:50.686
you get to do push-ups.

12:50.769 --> 12:51.270

13:57.336 --> 13:58.546

He's just a very

14:02.383 --> 14:03.175
I knew it.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.094
{\an1}That's why
he could only make toys.

That's it! Uh, that's it.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.927
It says here that
I have to come with you.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.638
(both)
What are we waiting for?

16:58.517 --> 16:59.977
(cheers and applause)

17:03.355 --> 17:06.316
Thanks for watching F-TV,
Fairy Television.

17:06.400 --> 17:06.942
I'm Wizzy.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.777
I'm your host,

17:08.861 --> 17:10.820
and I'm outside live
at this year's Zappy awards!

17:12.740 --> 17:14.241
Yes, sir, there's certainly
no shortage

17:14.324 --> 17:17.118
of magic celebrities
here tonight!

17:17.869 --> 17:18.662
I still don't see--

17:18.746 --> 17:20.079
Wait! There he is!

17:20.164 --> 17:23.959
The toughest fairy
in the universe!

17:24.041 --> 17:26.002
Drill instructor
from the fairy academy,

17:26.252 --> 17:28.589
Jorgen Von Strangle!

17:28.672 --> 17:29.840
(audience booing)

17:31.842 --> 17:33.635
Hello, tiny little creatures.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.387
Uh, hello, Jorgen.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.346
{\an1}This is Timmy,
the boy we watch over.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.224
And this is Winston.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.809
He's the boy I watch over.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.102
Make a wish.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.312
Now!

17:43.395 --> 17:45.522
I wish I could see
the age of 12!

17:45.606 --> 17:46.648
(crying)

17:46.732 --> 17:47.649
Ha-ha.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.817
He always makes that one.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.862
(Announcer)
Fairies and magic folk,

17:51.945 --> 17:54.281
here is your host
for this year's Zappy awards,

17:54.364 --> 17:55.532
Billy Crystalball!

17:55.824 --> 17:56.492
Good evening!

17:56.575 --> 17:58.327
I'm Billy Crystalball

17:58.410 --> 17:59.828
and I want to show you

17:59.912 --> 18:02.331
how to get "ahead" in life.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.248
Like this!

18:03.332 --> 18:04.291
(laughter)

18:04.750 --> 18:06.668
Oh, I just made that up!
Don't worry.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.378
I got 78 million of 'em!

18:08.462 --> 18:09.463
(shooting)

18:09.546 --> 18:10.088
(audience gasping)

18:10.714 --> 18:11.173
Start the show.

18:11.256 --> 18:11.715
Do it now!

18:11.799 --> 18:12.424
(gulps)

18:15.469 --> 18:19.097
And now the nominees
for best costume design.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.058
(Audience)
Ooh!

18:21.141 --> 18:22.351
Ah!

18:22.684 --> 18:23.852
(audience booing)

18:24.394 --> 18:26.980
And the Zappy goes to--

18:27.564 --> 18:28.148
(growls)

18:28.398 --> 18:29.942
{\an1}(laughs)
What do you know?

18:30.234 --> 18:32.110
Jorgen Von Strangle!

18:32.194 --> 18:33.237
(audience booing)

18:33.320 --> 18:34.446
Thank you.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.697
(host groans)

18:35.781 --> 18:36.532
You like me,
you really like me.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.034
You must like me!

18:39.117 --> 18:40.118
(audience booing)

18:40.577 --> 18:42.454
(audience cheering)

18:43.205 --> 18:45.666
And now the award
for best magical appearance.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.544
(audience exclaiming)

18:49.878 --> 18:52.005
(audience cheering)

18:53.298 --> 18:54.800
(blasting)

18:56.176 --> 18:57.636
Congratulations.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.637
Ha-ha.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.138
(thud)

19:00.222 --> 19:01.223
I don't want to thank
anybody but me.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.143
What? Is everybody
afraid of that guy?

19:04.434 --> 19:05.144
(both)
Yes!

19:05.227 --> 19:05.769
Oh.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.147
And now the award
for best overall godparenting.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.066
For this award,
each child must explain

19:11.149 --> 19:11.984
why they love
their fairy godparents.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.403
And the nominees are...

19:14.820 --> 19:16.238
Sally and Stan.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.739
Why do you love me, Sally?

19:18.073 --> 19:18.991
I don't know.

19:19.074 --> 19:19.658
(ka-ching)

19:19.741 --> 19:22.202
Oh! Now I remember!

19:22.286 --> 19:24.955
I love you, Stanley!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.290
(audience cheering)

19:26.623 --> 19:28.375
(Host)
Jorgen and his boy, Winston.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.752
Why do you love me, Winston?

19:30.836 --> 19:32.880
(shivering)
Because you tell me to?

19:32.963 --> 19:33.922
Because I tell you to what?

19:34.256 --> 19:37.676
Because you tell me to, sir!

19:37.926 --> 19:38.927
Congratulations, Jorgen.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.888
(audience exclaiming)

19:40.971 --> 19:42.347
Oh, uh, Timmy.

19:42.431 --> 19:42.848
Yeah.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.183
Why do you love
your fairy godparents?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.728
Why? What do you mean, why?

19:48.020 --> 19:48.937
They're my best friends.

19:49.021 --> 19:49.813
(audience gasping)

19:50.147 --> 19:51.106
(Man in audience)
Friends?

19:51.189 --> 19:52.107
It's like the partridge family.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.484
Well, they make me feel safe.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.236
They make me feel special.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.030
They make me feel loved.

19:58.405 --> 20:00.198
They may make a few mistakes,

20:00.282 --> 20:01.617
but they're my pals.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.661
{\an1}And I love 'em
more than anything.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.872
(both)
Oooh, Timmy!

20:07.247 --> 20:08.832
(crying)
Oh! Nah.

20:09.207 --> 20:09.917
Guess what, Timmy?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.209
Your godparents win!

20:11.293 --> 20:13.211
(Audience)
Yaaay, Timmy!

20:13.629 --> 20:15.047
Congratulations!

20:15.881 --> 20:17.299
(Jorgen)
I beg your pardon,

20:17.591 --> 20:18.675
but I think you have something
that belongs to me.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.844
No way, dude!

20:20.928 --> 20:21.637
You're not getting this award!

20:21.887 --> 20:23.639
Right, guys?

20:23.722 --> 20:25.182
(both)
Uh, yeah, right.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.600
(roaring)

20:26.683 --> 20:27.142
No!

20:27.684 --> 20:28.101
(both)
Timmy!

20:28.185 --> 20:29.978
(grunting)

20:30.395 --> 20:31.230
Ow!

20:35.609 --> 20:37.069
(audience gasping)

20:39.655 --> 20:40.739
(audience cheering)

20:40.822 --> 20:41.490
{\an1}(both)
The Tooth fairy!

20:42.824 --> 20:43.700
(sniffs)

20:43.784 --> 20:44.576
Minty! Not medicine-y!

20:44.660 --> 20:45.327
(gasps)

20:45.410 --> 20:45.577
What's the meaning of--

20:47.746 --> 20:48.121
(camera clicks)

20:48.914 --> 20:49.873
This?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.626
You weren't supposed
to lose this tooth for six days,

20:52.709 --> 20:55.045
four hours, and three minutes.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.631
Well, ma'am,
he made it fall out.

20:58.632 --> 20:59.466
Hi, honey.

20:59.549 --> 21:00.509
(all)
Honey?!

21:00.592 --> 21:01.009
He's got nice teeth.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.178
Jorgen, darling,

21:03.261 --> 21:04.763
how many times have I told you

21:04.846 --> 21:06.932
how I hate being
seen in public,

21:07.015 --> 21:08.809
(shouting)
without my makeup!

21:09.726 --> 21:10.560
(laughs)

21:11.687 --> 21:12.104
Oof!

21:12.729 --> 21:14.106
Now then, I think
you should apologize

21:14.189 --> 21:14.773
for knocking this
young man's tooth out.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.818
Yes, my little bicuspid.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.529
Eh, Timmy, is there anything me
or my muscles

21:20.612 --> 21:21.154
can do to make it up to you?

21:21.446 --> 21:24.032
Well, can I have my tooth back?

21:24.116 --> 21:24.950
{\an1}Oh, sorry.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.078
{\an1}But I have a very strict
no return policy.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.622
Timmy, take mine!

21:30.872 --> 21:33.417
They're large, shiny,
and powerful!

21:33.750 --> 21:34.334
Wow, thanks!

21:34.835 --> 21:37.713
Congratulations on your award,
you two.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.214
(both)
Thanks, Timmy!

21:39.298 --> 21:41.466
But we didn't really care
if we won or not.

21:41.717 --> 21:42.843
How come?

21:42.926 --> 21:44.970
Because our real reward
is just being with you.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.805
Aw, thanks, guys.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.056
(Mrs. Turner)
Here's your pancakes, Timmy.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.975
(Timmy)
Thanks, mom!

21:50.892 --> 21:52.436
(crunches)

21:52.519 --> 21:53.562
(chomping)

21:53.645 --> 21:55.939
{\an1}Hmm, must be all that fluoride
in the water.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.233
(gulps)

22:02.487 --> 22:03.947
(Narrator)
The Chin was off!

22:12.664 --> 22:13.123
Finished?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.542
Already?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.420
But I just started narrating!

22:19.546 --> 22:20.380
(crumbling)

22:20.464 --> 22:21.631
Well, that was easy.

22:23.091 --> 22:24.760
Perhaps too easy.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.429
What are these villains up to?

22:28.180 --> 22:29.556
Do the Chin and Cleft suspect

22:29.639 --> 22:31.349
that there may be
some master plan

22:31.433 --> 22:32.601
involved in all this?

22:33.894 --> 22:34.728
And why can't Cleft

22:34.811 --> 22:38.190
ever win
rock-paper-scissors?!

22:38.648 --> 22:40.275
