(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

00:53.960 --> 00:56.000
(CHEERING)

00:56.040 --> 00:58.200
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.880
Hello and welcome.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.600
-(CHEERING)
-Thank you.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.440
Thank you.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.880
Hello and welcome to what is
a Grand Tour special.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.920
Yep, and it's gonna
be a big one,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.200
because we've had
a request from Amazon.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.040
You know how if you're
watching a programme
and you pause it,

01:15.080 --> 01:17.680
you get to see a selection
of beautiful landscape
photographs

01:17.720 --> 01:19.200
from all around the world?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.200
Yeah, well, we've been asked
to come up with

01:21.200 --> 01:24.360
some new photographs
of wild animals.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.360
Yeah, us three,
wildlife photographers.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.360
What could possibly
go wrong with that?

01:28.400 --> 01:30.520
-(LAUGHTER)
-It's such an obvious idea,

01:30.560 --> 01:33.080
I don't know why we
never thought of it before.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.480
But, anyway, we decided that
obviously we'd need the right
gear and the right cars,

01:37.520 --> 01:40.240
and then we should meet up
with all of that

01:40.280 --> 01:44.920
in the most ecologically
diverse country on Earth...

01:44.960 --> 01:46.840
Colombia.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.280
JEREMY: Colombia is
nature's treasure chest.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.720
Its endless soaring peaks,
vast forests,

02:05.760 --> 02:08.680
lazy rivers
and babbling brooks

02:08.720 --> 02:12.240
are home to a greater
variety of birds and animals

02:12.280 --> 02:15.160
than you'll find
anywhere else on Earth.

02:19.760 --> 02:23.280
Of course,
common sense dictated
that to get our pictures,

02:23.320 --> 02:26.440
we should meet far from
the stain of humanity.

02:30.680 --> 02:34.040
But for some
extraordinary reason,

02:34.080 --> 02:36.440
Richard Hammond decided
that the start point

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
should be in the middle
of the night...

02:38.520 --> 02:43.000
close to the bustling city
of Cartagena...

02:43.040 --> 02:45.160
on a tropical beach.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.520
(BRAKES SQUEAK SOFTLY)

02:59.880 --> 03:02.080
JAMES: Morning.
JEREMY: Morning.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.000
Why did he say
meet on a beach

03:05.040 --> 03:07.800
and why...actually,
why did we listen to him?

03:07.840 --> 03:12.040
JEREMY:
Where is he? Hammond?

03:12.080 --> 03:14.720
JAMES: It's four o'clock,
for Pete's sake.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.960
-Uh, is that a Fiat Panda?
-Fiat Panda 4x4!

03:18.000 --> 03:20.280
JEREMY: It's terrible.
-It's fantastic.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.800
JEREMY: No, that's fantastic.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.600
Look at that. That is
a sturdy car, that is.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.320
JAMES: Isn't that
a very popular car
with the gay community?

03:28.360 --> 03:29.600
JEREMY: Is it?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.200
JAMES: There was a thing
in America

03:31.240 --> 03:34.560
where they had the top ten...
top ten LGBT cars.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.320
And that came third
or something.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.680
JEREMY: What, Lesbian,
Bacon... No, what is it?

03:40.720 --> 03:43.680
-Lesbian, Bacon,
Transgender...
-Lesbian...

03:43.720 --> 03:45.560
(HISSING)

03:45.600 --> 03:47.720
JEREMY: What's that?
Well, that was a...

03:47.760 --> 03:49.240
Wasn't that a distress flare?

03:49.280 --> 03:52.640
JAMES: Well, a red one
is a distress, isn't it?

03:52.680 --> 03:55.080
JEREMY: What's that?
-Hang on, is that...?

03:55.120 --> 03:57.680
Is there a person on t...?
There's somebody on it.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.960
JEREMY: Hello? Hello!

04:00.000 --> 04:02.120
RICHARD: Hello!
JAMES: It's Hammond.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.360
JEREMY: That is Hammond.
-Hammond!

04:04.400 --> 04:06.160
-Hammond!
-Hello! Here I am!

04:06.200 --> 04:08.440
-Is that you?
-Are you OK?

04:08.480 --> 04:11.040
RICHARD: Yes.
Some help would be good!

04:11.080 --> 04:12.920
Is that your car?

04:12.960 --> 04:16.520
-Yes. This is my car!
-It's his car.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.320
(BIRDCALLS)

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
JEREMY:
As the sun began to rise,

04:21.360 --> 04:23.160
we asked Hammond
to come ashore

04:23.200 --> 04:26.200
so we could work out
what on Earth was going on.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.640
Quite a lot
of explaining here.

04:29.680 --> 04:31.920
-A lot of unpacking.
-Morning.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.560
Yeah, good morning.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.200
Well, where do we begin?
Why is your car out there?

04:36.240 --> 04:39.240
Well, because that's where
the boat dropped me off.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.720
-What boat?
-Well, I shipped it
from North America.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.520
-Yeah.
-They got to here,
wrapped it in polythene,

04:43.560 --> 04:45.800
lobbed it over the side,
me with it.
That's how they do it.

04:45.800 --> 04:50.120
I think, I reckon, there's a
lot of trade between the two.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.480
There's bound to be,
isn't there?

04:51.520 --> 04:52.920
What,
so you're saying, what,

04:53.000 --> 04:54.880
that Colombia's exporting
something to America?

04:54.920 --> 04:56.520
Yes, exactly.
I think there's more...

04:56.560 --> 04:58.360
-And then the ships
are coming back empty?
-Precisely.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.800
I think there's
more of whatever it is

04:59.880 --> 05:01.720
going to North America,
so they go out full.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.360
Then they come back so you
can get a much cheaper ride.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.800
-Cost peanuts.
-Hold that.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.560
What are they shipping?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.680
JAMES: Well, what does
Colombia produce?

05:11.720 --> 05:14.640
JEREMY: I've got it here.
The main agricultural
products of Colombia

05:14.680 --> 05:18.120
are coffee, cut flowers,
bananas, rice, tobacco,

05:18.160 --> 05:20.920
forest products - whatever
they are - and shrimp.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.800
I bet it's shrimp.

05:22.880 --> 05:24.240
Yeah, but we were
wondering why they don't

05:24.240 --> 05:26.080
drop you off,
for example, in a port.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.760
I know.
They just, they don't use it.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.080
That's how they...
It all seemed
perfectly normal to them.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.920
Wrap it in polythene,
throw it over the side.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.920
-And threw you
over the side as well.
-Yeah. Yeah.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.000
What's it say on that?
Global Auto...?

05:36.040 --> 05:38.240
RICHARD: Yeah, GAK.
Global Auto Kings.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.880
They're... That's what
they said was the company.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.560
Problem we've got is...

05:42.600 --> 05:45.640
how are you gonna get
your car from there to here?

05:45.680 --> 05:47.480
I was rather hoping
that'd be we'd do that.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.440
No, no,
if you listen carefully,

05:49.480 --> 05:52.240
he said how you're
going to get your car
from there to here.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.720
"You" singular.
Just you, meaning you.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.560
-W...
-No, he didn't say "us".

05:56.600 --> 05:58.720
You made us get up
at four o'clock...

05:58.760 --> 06:01.160
JEREMY: Eventually, though,
James relented

06:01.200 --> 06:03.600
and agreed to pull
Hammond's car ashore.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.360
Right, go, May. Go, go, go!
Give it a yank.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.560
(ENGINE REVVING)

06:13.840 --> 06:15.680
James, what is that?
I mean...

06:15.720 --> 06:18.200
It's got 49 horsepower. It's
gonna ruin it. Get the Jeep.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.120
Can we find a small dog
instead to tow it?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.800
-Get the Jeep.
-Get the what?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.920
-This...
-What have you got?

06:24.960 --> 06:27.000
JEREMY: A Jeep. It's there.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.400
Well, bring that over!

06:30.440 --> 06:32.920
When I returned
in the LGB Jeep,

06:32.960 --> 06:36.080
Hammond thanked me -
by taking the mickey.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.040
That's very nice, by the way.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.440
-Well done. I'm proud of you.
-Why are you proud of me?

06:41.480 --> 06:44.280
You've done well.
That is a hard thing to do
and you've done it.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.080
You are gonna be
so much happier.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.440
Would you like me
to help you get your car...

06:49.480 --> 06:50.960
-I would, I would.
-...out of the sea?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.640
-Shut up, then.
-OK.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.640
I thought you might
be nicer now it's all
out in the open.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.520
We hitched up the rope

06:57.560 --> 07:01.640
and then waited for the
right wave to help us along.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.720
Go...now.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.040
-Yes!
-(rope snapping)

07:09.080 --> 07:11.760
No, not at all good. Whoa!

07:11.800 --> 07:16.360
JEREMY: I then realised
that we were doing this
all wrong.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.320
That is presumably
a pick-up truck.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.080
-Yes?
-Yes, you've guessed.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.800
And four-wheel drive, yes?
Right.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.360
Why don't you go out there,
cut away the polythene bag,

07:25.400 --> 07:28.120
and drive it out
using the engine?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.880
It's a good idea.
Cos what you don't do
when you drive a car

07:30.920 --> 07:32.640
is use the engine
in someone else's car.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.280
-You use the one
in your own car.
-Yes.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.240
So, while Hammond
unwrapped his car...

07:39.280 --> 07:43.640
James and I turned our
attention to his Fiat Panda.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.680
I bought it from
an English family

07:45.720 --> 07:48.320
who had bought
a house in Tuscany.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.440
And this... Pepe.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.640
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)
-Pepe the Panda.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.680
-And they loved it.
-Do you kn...

07:54.720 --> 07:56.960
I know everything
about this family.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.160
This has been used
for picking their friends
up from Pisa airport.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.840
Oh, undoubtedly.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.000
And their friends are...
the editor of the Guardian...

08:04.040 --> 08:05.920
-Yes.
-...Tony Blair...

08:05.960 --> 08:07.560
-Cherie Blair.
-Sting.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.640
-Alan Yentob.
-Yes.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.320
Every single
lightweight socialist

08:14.360 --> 08:17.160
in Britain
has been in this car.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.880
-I bet they made
their own olive oil as well.
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)

08:19.920 --> 08:21.800
Oh, they were socialists,
really.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.720
As they are sitting
with their Prosecco
and really care.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.880
"We're raising awareness."
"Raising awareness" means,

08:26.920 --> 08:28.480
"I'm doing
absolutely nothing at all."

08:28.520 --> 08:30.640
I'll bet they had a little
man in the village...

08:30.680 --> 08:32.760
JAMES: As the Pet Shop Boy
ranted on,

08:32.800 --> 08:36.080
Hammond finally
finished unwrapping
his pick-up truck.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.280
-Unfortunately, though...
-(ENGINE TURNS OVER)

08:40.320 --> 08:42.280
-...it wouldn't start.
-(ENGINE STOPS)

08:42.320 --> 08:44.240
(ENGINE STARTS AND STOPS)

08:44.280 --> 08:46.760
-(SYSTEM BEEP)
-No.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.520
So, after getting brained
by the waves for a while,

08:53.600 --> 08:56.640
he waded ashore again
and came up with
a hare-brained scheme

08:56.720 --> 09:01.040
where the Fiat would be
an anchor
and the Jeep a tug.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.440
Right, parking brake is off
and I am in neutral.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.600
Right. You're ready.
Uh...good, I am as well.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.240
I'm taking up the slack.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.880
(ENGINES IDLING)

09:11.880 --> 09:15.080
-Here we go.
-That's looking good.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.640
No, no.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.760
Clarkson, you're pulling me
into the sea! Clarkson!

09:21.760 --> 09:24.760
Stop! Stop!

09:25.880 --> 09:27.360
Why are you there?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.960
You've pulled me in the sea,
you muppet!

09:30.000 --> 09:33.200
-(VIDEO BREAKS UP)
-Oh, shit...

09:33.240 --> 09:35.520
JAMES: Thanks to
Hammond's stupid idea,

09:35.600 --> 09:39.120
the cameras in my car
were completely ruined.

09:39.160 --> 09:45.200
So we ordered a taxi,
sent him into town
to get a proper tow truck...

09:45.240 --> 09:48.520
...and when he returned, he
asked Jeremy of all people

09:48.520 --> 09:50.760
to operate its winch.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.760
-(WHIRRING)
JEREMY: Are you moving?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.880
Yes! Yes, I am!

09:55.880 --> 09:58.160
You see, you mock people
who like winching and stuff,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.040
but don't tell me
you're not enjoying this.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.600
It is incredible how much
power you can get

10:02.640 --> 10:05.720
out of a little tiny electric
winch. When you think...

10:05.760 --> 10:07.040
Is he having some sort of
winch fantasy?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.840
I've turned him off.

10:08.880 --> 10:12.760
I'm just sitting here making
sure that LED doesn't go red,

10:12.760 --> 10:14.760
in which case the winch
is overheating.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.160
Which he seems to think
is incredibly exciting.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.760
Jeremy? You need to stop,
you're gonna pull me
into the... the shelter.

10:20.840 --> 10:25.000
The only thing is...though
we have done well, actually,

10:25.040 --> 10:26.880
is these three cars
we've got.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.120
Because...they're all
designed to go off road

10:30.160 --> 10:31.880
and yet they couldn't be
more different.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.520
Jeremy, you're pulling me
through the building!

10:36.280 --> 10:38.960
That is true, it is,
it's a good trio of cars.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.640
RICHARD: W... No!

10:40.640 --> 10:42.760
You've got mine, which is
bought by people who like

10:42.840 --> 10:44.880
cruising the streets of
San Francisco, Key West,

10:44.880 --> 10:46.720
Brighton and Sydney.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.880
And then yours,
which is bought by people...

10:48.960 --> 10:51.760
-Jeremy! Stop!
-...who wanna feel better
about themselves.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.400
So if you have
your second home

10:53.440 --> 10:55.320
whilst people in the world
are homeless and starving,

10:55.360 --> 10:58.280
-it's OK as long as you have
a small Fiat.
-(THUD)

10:58.320 --> 11:01.000
JEREMY: Oh, shit.
Hammond, you moron!

11:01.040 --> 11:02.920
Well, I couldn't do anything!
I've got no steering.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.480
-Why didn't you tell us?
-I was yelling on the radio!

11:05.520 --> 11:07.120
You pulled me
through a building.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.920
This family has loved
this car since 1991

11:08.960 --> 11:11.680
and you turn up from bloody
Wales or North America,

11:11.720 --> 11:13.120
or wherever it is
you've been,

11:13.160 --> 11:14.480
and you've already
ruined it.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.240
Listen, it's been
a bit of a cluster thing.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.520
We need to work it all out.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.800
We need communications
properly organised.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.320
-What is that? That.
-You need a--

11:22.360 --> 11:24.520
It's my ladder. Ah.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.960
You've bought something
you can't get into or out of
without a ladder?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.320
Well, it's very high up.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.960
Hammond, that's the worst
thing I've ever seen.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.400
It's brilliant.
Look at it.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.880
That was like the best
Christmas I've ever had,

11:36.920 --> 11:38.320
unwrapping it out at sea.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.760
I was, "Ooh-hoo, can't wait!"

11:39.800 --> 11:42.240
And then I saw
a little bit of a flame. Ah!

11:42.280 --> 11:45.600
And what is that? A
skull-faced fox abomination?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.440
-Look at it.
-That is inspiration.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.240
It's already got
nature pictures on it.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.840
It's brilliant. Doesn't that
cheer you up a bit?

11:51.880 --> 11:53.640
-No, it doesn't cheer me up.
-Yes, it does.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.160
It makes you feel happy.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.160
JAMES: So far,
Hammond's pick-up

11:57.200 --> 11:58.600
had wrecked everything
on the beach

11:58.640 --> 12:00.760
and all my cameras

12:00.800 --> 12:02.920
and cost us ten hours.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.120
So we told him
to shut up - again -

12:05.160 --> 12:06.280
and get it working.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.960
(RICHARD GRUNTS)

12:08.000 --> 12:10.720
-And once he'd done that...
-(ENGINE STARTS)

12:10.760 --> 12:12.240
Yeah!

12:14.920 --> 12:18.120
..we headed into Cartagena
to buy some cameras.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.920
(SONG IN SPANISH)

12:30.440 --> 12:35.400
Right, this Jeep Wrangler
Hard-tail cost £8,000

12:35.440 --> 12:39.000
and absolutely everything
on it works.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.960
And...with my
Hercule Poirot hat on,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.960
I would say that this car
was originally sold in Japan,

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
because the television, CD,
satnav system here

12:49.040 --> 12:52.440
is all in Japanese,
which means I can't work it.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.200
And then you've got little
stickers all over everywhere.

12:55.240 --> 12:59.920
This one says -
look, "Hysteric Glamour"
and "CDC Rockers".

12:59.960 --> 13:02.960
That's a very Japanese-y
thing to do.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.280
So, this was built in Ohio,
shipped to...Japan,

13:07.320 --> 13:10.600
exported to England, and then
I've shipped it to Colombia.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.960
This, then, has done
120,000 miles on the road

13:14.000 --> 13:17.160
but about twice that
on ships.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.120
I think it's gonna be
ideal, though,

13:22.160 --> 13:24.640
for wildlife photography,

13:24.680 --> 13:26.800
because it's four-wheel
drive, it's a Jeep.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.040
So I could use it
to track a snow leopard.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.080
It's got a 4-litre
straight 6,

13:32.120 --> 13:34.520
so I could keep up
with a diving eagle.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.840
And, of course, no roof,
fold-down windscreen,

13:36.880 --> 13:41.360
so a 360-degree field of fire
for my camera.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
(ENGINE HUMMING)

13:50.720 --> 13:56.040
(CHUCKLES)
Let me fill you in a bit on
my 1998 Chevy C/K Silverado.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.120
It's a full-size
American pick-up

13:58.160 --> 14:00.440
that's been made a bit bigger
with a lift kit

14:00.480 --> 14:02.520
and modifications that
I'll tell you about later.

14:02.560 --> 14:08.240
Most importantly,
it's got a proper big,
old 7.4-litre V8 up front

14:08.280 --> 14:09.880
in a very lazy
state of tune,

14:09.920 --> 14:12.520
just churning out
huge gobbets of grunt.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.920
I have four-wheel drive -
high and low ratios.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.080
That and this massive
lift kit, I can go anywhere.

14:21.120 --> 14:24.560
Probably most
wildlife photographers
use things like this, anyway.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.240
You don't see it,
you know, on the telly
with Attenborough and stuff,

14:27.280 --> 14:28.800
cos, well, this is
behind the scenes.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.320
This is how they get there.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.600
(SONG IN SPANISH)

14:36.720 --> 14:39.920
Now we're alone, viewers,
let me tell you a little bit
about my car.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.640
I know some of you
are thinking, "Oh,
that's just a Fiat Panda,"

14:42.680 --> 14:44.320
and "They're in South
America.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.400
They're bound to be going
over difficult terrain."

14:46.440 --> 14:48.680
Yes, yes, yes.
But let me tell you this.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.000
What you need
for serious off-roading

14:51.040 --> 14:52.880
is smallness and lightness.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.360
That's what I've got.
This is a tiny car.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.880
It weighs 780 kilograms.

14:57.920 --> 15:02.720
A quarter of what Hammond's
stupid monster truck weighs.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.800
It has a four-wheel drive
system made in Austria,

15:05.840 --> 15:07.360
very dependable.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.920
Does have
inclinometers on it,

15:08.960 --> 15:11.080
so that I can see
when I'm about to fall over.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.320
And it's perfect.
It all works.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.760
The fan, the cooling system,
all the instruments.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.200
It's all perfect.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.440
JAMES: But then...

15:21.480 --> 15:24.560
My indicators have just
packed up so, you know,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.520
there will be no indications.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.920
Problems with
Italian electrics?

15:28.960 --> 15:32.160
I know, it's unheard of.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.960
The lift kit added to this
car by the previous owner

15:35.000 --> 15:39.920
has not improved the
steering or handling or ride.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.480

15:45.440 --> 15:47.840
Bless him,
he's all exuberant.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.920
Finally, he can be himself,
and good for him.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.240
JEREMY: Soon we arrived at
the really rather beautiful

15:55.280 --> 15:58.000
walled city of Cartagena.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.920
Which was bad news
for the not-at-all beautiful
Trump truck.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.640
Oh, wait a minute.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.520
Oh, hang on.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.640
Are these walls important
and, like, really old
and precious?

16:14.680 --> 16:16.480
JEREMY:
17th century, Hammond.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.680
That's how old they are.
It's a World Heritage Site.

that old, the odd chip
won't matter, will it?

for the bruised fruit...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.320
Here. I do apologise.

that the Wrangler's
a... a gay icon.

JEREMY: Eventually,
having got our shopping done,

18:31.800 --> 18:34.560
we met up
for a camera show-and-tell.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.240
And, once again,
Hammond had gone
completely over the top.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.200
What have you bought?

18:46.240 --> 18:47.640
Everything.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.720
If I know anything about
wildlife photographers,

18:49.760 --> 18:51.680
you need the kit.
So this goes around my waist.

18:51.720 --> 18:55.640
In here I have a selection
of prime lenses.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.880
A real... That's a macro

stuff, like, really close.

This is a 50 mil prime,
really fast, beautiful lens.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.160

another harness.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.800

for the flash guns.
There's two flash guns.

one another off as well.

-What?

-You pull up by an animal.
-Yeah?

19:15.080 --> 19:16.880
-You need a photograph of it.
-Oh, yeah.

run off any minute.

that animal is,

flash for it...

have to hope it's dead
or it'll simply run off.

of course, camera body.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.480
And after just 20 minutes...

21:40.520 --> 21:42.800
(CLICKING)

21:42.800 --> 21:46.880
...we met up to celebrate
a job well done.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.080
-Yeah, I've got a dog.
-You've got that horse one.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.720
I've got a pigeon
looking gormless.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.560
I think we... Haven't we
pretty much done it?

21:52.640 --> 21:55.080
RICHARD: A number of dogs
and a number of horses.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.040
And a spider's ho...
The spider had gone,

21:58.080 --> 22:00.160
but I've got
the hole the spider...
That's habitat.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.840
You've got where
the spider lived.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
-That's habitat.
-Oh, hang on, sorry.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.480
That's what they want.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.840
Chaps, we have a message here
from Mr Wilman.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.960
-What?
-What does he want?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.680
It's bad news, I'm afraid.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.400
Amazon don't just want
pictures of pigeons,
dogs, and flies.

22:15.440 --> 22:18.680
They want
interesting stuff as well.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.640
They insist the following
must be included:

22:21.680 --> 22:25.000
a condor, a spectacled bear,

22:25.040 --> 22:28.040
a jaguar
and a hippopotamus.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.560
And they must be wild.
You can't just go to a zoo.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.680
Hippopotamus?
You don't get those here.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.560
-They don't have them here,
do they?
-In Africa.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.240
Well, how are we
gonna do that, then?

22:37.280 --> 22:39.320
How in the hell
are we gonna get a picture

22:39.360 --> 22:40.640
of a hippopotamus
in South America?

22:40.680 --> 22:42.480
You've got
a really long lens!

22:42.520 --> 22:45.080
But I'll have to be on a very
tall mountain to see Africa.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.920
Well, I tell you what
we're not going to see
lumbering by here...

22:51.400 --> 22:55.400
JEREMY: The next day,
armed with our new and more
challenging instructions,

22:55.440 --> 22:59.040
we decided to make
an early start.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.760

23:05.320 --> 23:07.280
JAMES: What was that?

23:07.320 --> 23:10.560
It's... The starter keeps
engaging whilst the engine
is running. Hang on.

-Only does it occasionally.

JEREMY: Leaving Hammond
to repair the endlessly
annoying Trump truck,

23:43.920 --> 23:46.280
May and I hit the road.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.080
(POP SONG IN SPANISH)

23:50.920 --> 23:52.800
Well, shrimping
and forest products

23:52.840 --> 23:55.040
obviously uh...pays well.

23:55.080 --> 23:57.800
-Look at the boats out there.
JAMES: I know,
that is amazing, isn't it?

23:57.840 --> 24:00.360
You often see that. The
most humble of commodities

24:00.400 --> 24:04.160
and it yields just incredible
wealth for a privileged few.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.200
Yeah.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.880
Right, we're now
leaving Cartagena

24:08.920 --> 24:13.000
in our quest to find
many interesting animals
to photograph,

24:13.040 --> 24:15.800
including...a hippopotamus.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.320
That's the tricky one.

24:20.360 --> 24:25.040
Obviously, many difficult
challenges would lie ahead.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.200
There'd be thick forests...

24:36.320 --> 24:37.880
Oh, Jesus!

24:37.920 --> 24:40.200
...and dreadful weather.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.800
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

24:42.840 --> 24:48.040
But we weren't unduly worried
because we were using cars.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.440
JAMES:
Photographers like to pretend

24:50.480 --> 24:52.680
that everything
is more complicated
than it needs to be.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.600
So, you know,
boxes and lenses and bags -

24:54.640 --> 24:56.440
all the stuff
Richard Hammond's got.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.320
Also wildlife photographers
like to pretend

24:59.360 --> 25:01.400
that life
has to be difficult.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.160
Live up a tree
for three weeks,

25:03.200 --> 25:04.920

on an iceberg

25:04.960 --> 25:06.920
to take a picture of
a polar bear or whatever.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.400
No. It can be comfortable.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.720
The car can make
anything comfortable.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.320
Drive up,
take your picture, drive off.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.960
Sadly, though, while we were
covering the ground

25:20.000 --> 25:21.840
quickly and comfortably,

25:21.880 --> 25:25.040
photographic opportunities
were a bit sparse.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.680
More cows. And a goat thing.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.560
Yeah, not wild
or interesting.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.440
JAMES: No, fair enough,
I'll give you that.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.400
Dead dog.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.280
Oh, quite a sweet
dead dog, though.

25:40.320 --> 25:43.320
Well, it was sweet
when it was alive.

25:43.360 --> 25:46.920
JEREMY: Even our now mobile
colleague was having no joy.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.720
RICHARD:
Come on out. Come on.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.920
Oh, stop hiding
behind the damn tree,
you little (BLEEP)!

25:54.960 --> 25:58.520
And annoyingly for me,
on these rural roads,

25:58.560 --> 26:01.600
the Jeep started to show
its true colours.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.080
-(THUDDING)
-Oh, God.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.280
Ooh, the ride's not good.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.920
-(THUDDING)
-Oh, Jesus.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.440
Ohh, I'm supposed
to be proving

26:11.480 --> 26:15.040
that wildlife photography
is easy and comfortable.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.400
Jeep's letting me down
a little bit on that front.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.480
-(THUDDING)
-Aaargh.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.880
Keen to have a break
from the relentless bouncing,

26:24.920 --> 26:29.480
I suggested
we stop to photograph
an animal everyone likes...

26:29.520 --> 26:30.800
a donkey.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.960
Come on.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

26:36.120 --> 26:37.960
Aw.

26:38.000 --> 26:43.040
However, my long lens saw
something rather disturbing.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.040
Come on, there's a man
in the back of shot.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.280
Wait, hang on.

26:54.400 --> 26:57.120
So, I went with
our translator

26:57.160 --> 26:59.520
to talk to people
in the local village.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Could you ask...did...

27:04.040 --> 27:09.120
Was that young man having
relations with that donkey

27:09.160 --> 27:11.440
or did I miss-see something?

27:12.440 --> 27:15.600
(SHE SPEAKS SPANISH)

27:20.680 --> 27:22.680
-OK.
-Si?

27:24.560 --> 27:27.880
They say yes.
That's right.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.440
-What did he say, normal?
-No, no trouble. At all.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.200
-Normal.
-Normal?

27:32.240 --> 27:34.080
Si. Normal.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.360
-So you've all...
-(THEY SPEAK SPANISH)

27:37.400 --> 27:39.600
...enjoyed the company
of donkeys?

27:39.640 --> 27:44.160
(THEY SPEAK SPANISH)

27:44.200 --> 27:48.520
(THEY CONTINUE IN SPANISH)

27:48.560 --> 27:50.800
(SHE LAUGHS)

27:50.840 --> 27:53.040
So they say that basically
that's the first wife,

27:53.080 --> 27:55.760
the first lover
that they have.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.920
-(SHUTTER CLICKS)
-That's nice.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.920
Are all the donkeys
fair game?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.600
Every single donkey,
or just...

28:01.640 --> 28:04.360
(THEY SPEAK SPANISH)

28:04.400 --> 28:06.640
All of them, male and female?

28:06.680 --> 28:08.920
(THEY SPEAK SPANISH)

28:12.640 --> 28:15.040
Oh, OK, no. Only female.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.120
So they don't have sex
with male donkeys.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.160
That would be what, weird?

28:21.680 --> 28:24.200
So they said
down here somewhere.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.920
Oh, hello.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.560
Donkeys.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.560
Oh, we'll be photographing
donkeys, then, I guess.

28:29.600 --> 28:30.760
Excellent.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.120
Right,
try not to make a noise.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.840
I shan't. Don't worry.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.240
Cos this one's
particularly timid.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.440
(HE GASPS)

28:42.480 --> 28:44.680
Hang on.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.000
We're leaving now.
Leave, now.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.360
-What?
-We're leaving.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.720
Ah, it seemed like
a really nice little place.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.000
Jeremy, why do we have to go?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.640
Have you upset someone?

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
He's either committed
some terrible faux pas

29:08.920 --> 29:12.320
or he's got sunstroke -
he's very red in the face.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.880
Why don't these Colombians
just grow something?

29:16.920 --> 29:20.520
Surely there must be
a plant of some sort

29:20.560 --> 29:24.040
that people living out in
the sticks could grow here,

29:24.080 --> 29:25.600
and then sell
around the world...

29:27.600 --> 29:30.040
...rather than...
interfering with animals.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.680
We continued onwards,

29:37.720 --> 29:41.960
acutely aware that so far our
mission was not going well.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.040
JEREMY: What photographs have
we got between us so far?

29:51.080 --> 29:52.720
Have either of you two
got anything

29:52.760 --> 29:54.720
you could put on
an Amazon screensaver?

29:54.760 --> 29:57.040
I have a selfie
with a donkey.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.160
Yeah, you wouldn't wanna
use my donkey photograph,

29:59.200 --> 30:00.960
that's for damn sure.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.160
We've got nothing
between us so far at all.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.040
But then...

30:07.640 --> 30:10.920
No, wait. What's this?

30:10.960 --> 30:13.480
Looks like a badger
having a massive poo.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.840
No, that's an anteater.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.640
JEREMY: You're right, it is.
It's an anteater.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.680
But it's only
a picture of one.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.560
But what it's doing
is telling us

30:21.600 --> 30:23.640
they cross the road here.

30:23.680 --> 30:27.520
Well, hang on. If they cross
the road here, we just wait.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.920
Why chase?

30:47.240 --> 30:49.920
I think they've put the sign
in the wrong place,

30:49.960 --> 30:54.120
because...
no anteater has crossed here.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.520
We've been now eight minutes.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.600
Three minutes after that,

31:03.640 --> 31:06.680
we realised we needed
to break out a map

31:06.720 --> 31:09.720
and get radical.

31:09.760 --> 31:13.320
Right, spectacled bears
don't live here.

31:13.360 --> 31:15.640
Neither do condors
and neither do jaguars.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.000
So let's go to where...

31:17.040 --> 31:19.960
Yeah, we're sort of here,

31:20.000 --> 31:22.240
just outside Cartagena.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.920
We need to come down...

31:24.960 --> 31:28.400
I mean right down here, into
the Amazonian rainforest.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.280
National parks,
the mountains.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.480
What the pros do
is go to the right habitat.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.720
I know that, because
I'm leaning on my camera,
like a pro.

31:39.480 --> 31:43.320
JEREMY: One of the main
targets on our hit list
was the jaguar,

31:43.360 --> 31:46.000
and they live mostly
in the region of Santander,

31:46.040 --> 31:49.040
which was 400 miles away.

31:49.080 --> 31:53.960
So we saddled up
and settled down
for the long drive south.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.800
I'd love to tell you how fast
my 49 horsepower is taking me

32:03.840 --> 32:06.080
but the speedometer,
which is electronic,

32:06.120 --> 32:11.720
has stopped working
since Richard Hammond
pulled me into the sea.

32:11.760 --> 32:17.600
In a bid to pass the time,
I dreamed up a simple game.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.040

alongside your colleague,

32:20.080 --> 32:23.720

32:23.760 --> 32:27.360
with your
7.4 litre monster truck,

32:27.400 --> 32:30.000
and let's see who's got
the slowest car, OK?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.280
Er, OK.

32:34.800 --> 32:38.320
Three, two, one, go.

I don't want you to take this
personally or anything,
Hammond,

33:13.640 --> 33:16.720
but your truck
must be utter garbage.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.240
Absolute garbage.

You wait, this thing'll
come into its own soon
and you'll be left gasping.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.640
I'm longing to see

33:26.680 --> 33:28.920

comes into its own.

lights on my truck include
engine service soon,

34:35.280 --> 34:37.480

brake failure indicator,

34:37.520 --> 34:40.480
anti-lock brake failure
indicator.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.280
Lights I don't have
is the one that tells me
what gear I'm...

-Oh!
-(TYRES SCREECHING)

34:50.160 --> 34:51.440
Ah.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.480
Are we not concentrating,
Hammond?

34:53.520 --> 34:56.360
(LAUGHS)
I may have had a wee.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.960
JEREMY: It is one of the most
stupid pieces of engineering
ever, that truck.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.120
(HE CHUCKLES)

35:05.560 --> 35:10.920
JEREMY: Since the jaguars
weren't going to be
in built-up areas,

35:10.960 --> 35:13.520
we ploughed deep
into the jungle,

35:13.560 --> 35:18.160
along a dirt path
that was once a railway
built by the British.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.040
(BIRDS SCREECHING)

35:23.080 --> 35:25.680
Right, Jaguars, they are
very difficult to spot

35:25.760 --> 35:29.160
and very, very rare.

35:29.160 --> 35:32.320
You don't want to come
face to face with a Jaguar,
though.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.760
Cos it does have
very strong bitey bits.

35:35.800 --> 35:40.600
Kills its prey by biting
through its skull and
then penetrating its brain.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.840
This is proper jungle now.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.280
Oh, hello.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.800
I'm in a British
railway tunnel.
Oh, no, Hammond.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.320
(ENGINE REVVING)

36:01.360 --> 36:03.920
-Ohh, tunnel.
-(ENGINE REVVING)

36:06.960 --> 36:08.920
Stop it!

36:10.440 --> 36:12.640
I had to do it, it's the law.

36:17.160 --> 36:20.960
RICHARD: We drove for miles
along the disused railway,

36:21.000 --> 36:25.200
until eventually,
LGB Jeremy came to a halt.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.920
Gentlemen,
I'm rather confused here.

36:31.960 --> 36:34.160
We're approaching a bridge,
OK?

36:34.200 --> 36:38.680
It says no cars, no people,
no motorcycles and no horses.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.440
Well, what's it for, then?

36:42.480 --> 36:45.600
JEREMY: Moments later,
we found out.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.120
It's all right, James, why
don't you just... (LAUGHS)

36:59.160 --> 37:00.640
He is actually going.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.400
James doesn't like heights.

37:03.440 --> 37:06.000
-Oh, did you see
that one just move?
-Yes.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.000
-(CLUNKING)
-What is that? Hold on.

37:08.040 --> 37:10.440
That's one, two.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.920
You've got seven,
maybe eight feet.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.160
But that means I'll have
to drive... I can't...

37:15.200 --> 37:16.640
You will.
It's got massive tyres.

37:16.640 --> 37:19.120
You'll just be running on
the outer ones.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.320
Well...
So I get to this bit...

37:24.560 --> 37:26.680
My car is wider than that,

37:26.760 --> 37:28.960
and that's wider than
my wheel. It won't do it.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.120
And that's high, actually.
What is that? 300 feet?

37:32.160 --> 37:34.840
RICHARD:
Some hundreds of feet, yes.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.120
Oh, dear.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.280
Even though Hammond
isn't at all accident prone,

37:42.320 --> 37:44.640
I went first.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.320
Seat belt on or off?

37:47.360 --> 37:48.640
Off.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.000
Because what bloody
difference will it make?

Really.

37:58.920 --> 38:02.280
Jesus.

38:02.320 --> 38:06.360
Oh, God, there's a really,
really narrow bit there.

Ooh, ahh.

38:07.920 --> 38:11.760
(NERVOUS WHIMPERING)

38:11.800 --> 38:14.040
Oh, speed.

38:14.080 --> 38:17.640

speed's the answer. Ah.

(TIMBERS RATTLING)

38:22.440 --> 38:25.160
Oh, oh.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.640
Right. I've made it.
That's good.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.840
JEREMY: Hammond, you will
shit your pants doing this.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.960
Well, that's helpful.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.040
I already am, watching.

not looking down,

38:46.160 --> 38:47.640
thinking about other things.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.640
And then it was the turn
of Big Donald.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.000
(SIGHS) Oh, God.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.680
Ah. Ah.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.480
The only way I can do this
is by looking at
the driver's-side tyre,

39:08.520 --> 39:11.200
and keeping it as close
as I can to that edge,

39:11.280 --> 39:13.360
and hoping to God
that gives me enough.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.280
Oh, Christ.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.160
Oh, Jesus.
I'm shaking all over.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.920
I can do this.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.760
I'm just gonna
look at the wood,

39:28.800 --> 39:31.000
not at what's below,
just look at the wood.

-Ah!

39:37.800 --> 39:40.320

39:50.640 --> 39:53.120
Argh. God!

39:56.640 --> 39:59.560
(GROANS)
I think I might be sick.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.680
I will get there.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.000
Crossing this bridge
is just part of my journey.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.400
JEREMY: Who is that, clippety
clopping across my bridge?

40:13.440 --> 40:15.120
Oh, God!

40:17.800 --> 40:19.880
Not the Billy Goat Gruff
game.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.880
Mm, I will move my Jeep
out of your way

40:22.920 --> 40:27.360
if you can answer this
simple prog rock question.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.600
I don't know anything
about prog rock at all!

Who is the bass guitarist
in Barclay James Harvest?

this (BLEEP) bridge!

Let me off the bridge.
I'm gonna be sick. Please.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.400
JEREMY: Eventually Hammond
became quite irritated,

40:45.440 --> 40:47.600
so I abandoned the game

40:47.640 --> 40:51.640
and soon all of us
became quite irritated.

40:51.680 --> 40:55.560
There were more not
very well maintained bridges.

40:55.600 --> 40:57.360
Oh, God in heaven.

41:00.680 --> 41:03.400
The heat was stifling...

41:03.440 --> 41:05.040
and the ride in the Jeep

41:05.080 --> 41:07.960
became more and more
intolerable.

Not taking this punishment
very well.

have you broken down?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.160
Yes.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.480
It's a very thoughtful place
to break down, this.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.000
-Why is that?
-Well, because, look,
there's a little path

41:32.040 --> 41:33.440
Hammond and I
can go round.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.920
-He is absolutely right.
-Off you go.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.200
Leave it. Don't touch it.
Leave it.

-I'm trying to help.
-Don't try and help.

(GROANS) Everybody's getting
a bit bad tempered.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.640
Might be because it's so hot.
Could be that.

on us helping, is he?

-I couldn't see the bumper.

right next to the thing.

-Right.

are you doing?

everything's fine.

It is gorgeous, isn't it?

43:47.800 --> 43:51.680
Yeah. And of course
we're not in the shade
of the jungle any more,

43:51.720 --> 43:53.440
which means
I'm being roasted.

In fact, I think they
took part in a couple
on the quiet.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.040
They just didn't want people
to know about it.

44:34.080 --> 44:35.720
They thought it would sort of

44:35.760 --> 44:38.880
damage their reputation
and their standing.

But we had yet to bag a jag.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.720
However,
as it's a nocturnal animal,

44:59.760 --> 45:02.960
we were hoping for more luck
as darkness fell.

Predictably, though...

-Sure?

47:25.160 --> 47:27.040
-Yes, just turn it off.
-What?

47:27.080 --> 47:30.120
-Just turn the engine off.
-What?

47:30.160 --> 47:32.800
-Turn the engine off.
-Oh, right, yeah.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.240
-(ENGINE REVS)
-Oh, sorry, it was in gear.

47:35.280 --> 47:38.200
(ENGINE REVS AND STOPS)

47:38.240 --> 47:40.920
When my colleagues
were finally silent,

47:40.960 --> 47:43.920
we settled down
to wait for a jaguar,

47:43.960 --> 47:45.880
something which
the experts say

47:45.920 --> 47:48.360
requires immense patience.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.280
(INSECTS SINGING)

47:56.360 --> 48:00.240
RICHARD: I'm bored!
I'm bored and I'm getting
eaten by mosquitos.

48:00.280 --> 48:02.640
JAMES: I'm being eaten
and I'm bored as well.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.720
RICHARD: If a jaguar
came now, I wouldn't see it.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.840
My eyes have shut down...

48:06.880 --> 48:08.640
from boredom.

48:08.680 --> 48:11.880
-What are we going to do?
-I don't know,
but that is boring.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.720
No, cos honestly,
I mean the truth is,

48:13.760 --> 48:16.240
people could come out here
for 40 years

48:16.280 --> 48:19.040
and not see a jaguar.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.960
Well, we could use
my trap cameras.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.720
-Your what?
-What are trap cameras?

48:23.760 --> 48:26.000
Set it up, and triggered by
an animal and take a picture.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.240
-You've got those with you?
-Yeah. In my bag.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.520
Well, why the hell didn't you
say that when we turned up?

48:30.560 --> 48:32.000
Nobody asked.

48:32.040 --> 48:36.120
I'm sorry, yes, Richard,
get your trap cameras out.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.680
-What a great idea.
-Right, OK. Plan! I'll do it.

48:39.720 --> 48:41.360
Oh, I've just remembered,

48:41.400 --> 48:43.680
I've got a jaguar in the
boot, shall I let that out?

48:43.720 --> 48:46.400
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

48:46.440 --> 48:51.400
After a while, Hammond
had carpeted the area
with his trap cameras.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.680
-Now what do we do?
-Wait.

49:00.720 --> 49:03.280
We wait for an animal to walk
past one and set it off?

49:03.320 --> 49:05.880
-Yes.
-How do we know
when it's gone off?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.120
Well, we just will.

49:11.640 --> 49:14.400
Er... I need a dump.

49:14.440 --> 49:17.280
-I'll alert the media.
-Well, I'm just saying.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.600
Don't worry,
I'm gonna sort myself out.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.520
Sorry.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.800
-It's all this foreign food.
-Ssh.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.280
He's not such a good
outdoors man's person

49:28.320 --> 49:31.920
as he likes to think,
cos I bet he hasn't got
any bog roll.

49:31.960 --> 49:34.960
I'll bet you he'll just use
a smooth stone.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.760
-A smooth stone?
-Mmm.

49:36.800 --> 49:38.400
That's what snipers use

49:38.440 --> 49:41.120
when they're posted out
in the middle of nowhere.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.520
They wipe themselves
with a smooth stone.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.000
-Why a smooth stone?
-Well...

49:47.040 --> 49:48.960
presumably because
it's uncomfortable

49:49.000 --> 49:50.480
to use a jaggedy one.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.400
Oh, yeah, but not...

49:52.440 --> 49:54.080
Well, you'd probably use
a leaf, actually,
in the jungle.

49:54.120 --> 49:56.000
I mean... (VOICE FADES)

49:56.040 --> 49:57.440
After much debate about

49:57.480 --> 50:00.400
how the special forces
wipe their bottoms,

50:00.440 --> 50:03.040
Hammond returned
and I quickly realised

50:03.080 --> 50:05.480
we were being thick.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.400
These are set off remotely?

50:07.440 --> 50:10.000
-Yeah. If an animal...
-Well, why are we still here?

50:10.040 --> 50:11.520
That's a very good point,
actually.

50:11.560 --> 50:13.560
It's better
that we go away, isn't it?

50:13.600 --> 50:16.400
Let's take the Bear Grylls
approach to natural history.

50:16.440 --> 50:18.920
There was a town,
well, ten kilometres away.

50:18.960 --> 50:22.160
Why don't we go into
the town, have a drink,

50:22.200 --> 50:24.120
check into a hotel,
how's that sound?

50:24.160 --> 50:26.400
And then come back tomorrow
and check the cameras.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.360
-Yes, yes.
-That's how you're
supposed to use them.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.800
It's in the instructions.
That's what you do.
You set it up...

50:30.840 --> 50:34.480
This good news put me in
the mood for some mischief.

50:34.520 --> 50:37.400
So, after May had
gone to bed at the hotel,

50:37.440 --> 50:41.680
Hammond and I sneaked outside
to mess with his head.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.480
-He parked his car there.
-Yes.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.880
Turn it round.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.280
Oh, that'll
mess with his head.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.360
So, in the morning,
can you imagine his face?

50:50.400 --> 50:53.120
Yeah, and he'll know
exactly where he parked it,
cos it's him.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.800
So then he'll think...
he'll think he's gone mad.

50:55.840 --> 50:59.640
-How are we gonna do it?
-Bounce it. Ready?

50:59.680 --> 51:04.360
-Oh, yeah.
-So one, two, three, move it.

51:04.400 --> 51:07.640
One, two, three, move it.

51:07.680 --> 51:10.680
One, two three, move it.

51:10.720 --> 51:12.360
One, two...

51:15.560 --> 51:19.680
The next morning,
with James in a state
of deep puzzlement,

51:19.720 --> 51:23.560
Hammond and I checked out
the ruined trap cameras.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.760
So let me
just get this clear.

51:27.800 --> 51:29.920
The jaguar
mauled your camera?

51:29.960 --> 51:31.360
Yeah.

51:31.400 --> 51:33.200
Is that really
where it's bitten it?

51:33.240 --> 51:34.800
-It's got bits come off.
-He's broken it.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.760
-Yes, he's broken it.
-But did we...

51:36.800 --> 51:38.120
This is the important thing.

51:38.160 --> 51:41.240
Did we get...
ahem, any pictures?

51:41.280 --> 51:43.920
-Right, I'll have a look.
BOTH: No.

51:43.960 --> 51:47.280
Er...something triggered it.
Maybe a leaf.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.520
-Ah, look, there!
-Where?

51:49.560 --> 51:52.080
There. That's its...
That's it!

51:52.120 --> 51:54.480
-That's it walking about.
-Look how camouflaged it is.

51:54.520 --> 51:57.360
There's its head!
That's its actual face.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.600
There.

51:59.640 --> 52:01.720
Yeah, but he's got a tree
in front of him.

52:01.760 --> 52:04.080
Yeah, but that's context,
that's habitat.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.840
(GASPS) What's that?

52:05.880 --> 52:08.040
This is when it got
destroyed. That's its...

52:08.080 --> 52:09.960
That's its mouth.
That's whiskers, look.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.800
-No!
-That's its...

52:11.840 --> 52:13.840
That's a jaguar biting.

52:13.880 --> 52:15.960
That is an action shot.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.840
That's probably
got awards all over it.

52:17.880 --> 52:19.960
JEREMY: Oh, yeah.
-Eyes.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.480
(JEREMY GASPS)

52:21.520 --> 52:24.360
Now, that is a great picture
and we can move on.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.560
-It is.
-We have ticked that box.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.520
That's the Ace of Spades,
the jaguar.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.560
That's Saddam Hussein.

52:30.600 --> 52:32.920
We've now gotta go
and get his sons...

52:34.360 --> 52:36.160
...Uday and the other one.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.240
What was his
other son called?

52:38.280 --> 52:42.400
-Edgar.
-(JEREMY LAUGHS WHEEZILY)

200 miles

of Spades, Edgar Hussein...

52:56.200 --> 52:57.440
Oh-ho!

52:57.480 --> 53:00.080
Oh-ho, look at you
with a wheel in the air!

53:00.120 --> 53:01.560
Gravity gets you down there

53:01.600 --> 53:04.280
and then you simply
drive up the other side.

Stop there. Stop there.
It's gonna break.

It's a bear!

53:16.520 --> 53:19.080
We've been told
we're at 15,500 feet.

53:21.560 --> 53:23.400
Nothing for it,
we've gotta go higher...

you've got oxygen for you
and your car only,

and we can see nothing!

We're on a volcano
in a severe hailstorm.

It's bouncing in
through the back.

is there in the sky?
