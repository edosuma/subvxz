02:24.644 --> 02:26.134
Clark?

03:32.411 --> 03:35.039
- Where have you been?
- We've been looking for you.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.739
- I've been out.
- Hey. Hey, son.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.407
What is going on with you?

03:39.585 --> 03:41.280
You've been acting strange all week.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.854
It's like your mind's somewhere else.
What's up?

03:51.063 --> 03:54.191
When I woke up this morning,
I was in the middle of Route 8.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.533
How did you get there?

03:59.038 --> 04:00.733
I don't know.

04:01.006 --> 04:04.567
Lex almost hit me with his car.
He gave me a ride home.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.401
Lex.

04:07.580 --> 04:12.244
Told him I was sleepwalking, but I'm not
sure how much walking was involved.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.911
I've been having this dream all week.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.680
I'm flying over Smallville.

04:18.858 --> 04:22.225
I always end up at the cave.
It's like it's calling out to me...

04:22.394 --> 04:24.157
...trying to give me answers.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.262
Answers to what, Clark?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.931
I'm not sure.

04:29.368 --> 04:33.998
But in my dream I take the key
and I put it in the slot in the cave wall...

04:34.173 --> 04:36.539
...then there's this bright light.

04:37.743 --> 04:40.769
- And?
- I don't know, that's when I wake up.

04:41.580 --> 04:42.808
Clark.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.780
Dreaming about putting that key
in a rock wall is one thing...

04:47.953 --> 04:50.581
...but we have no idea
what would happen if you did that.

04:50.756 --> 04:53.020
These dreams are getting
more intense every night.

04:53.192 --> 04:56.025
- Who knows where I'll wake up tomorrow.
- It's too dangerous.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.763
That cave could have
all the answers I'm looking for.

04:58.931 --> 05:00.922
Why are you so afraid to let me find out?

05:07.206 --> 05:09.265
I gotta get dressed for school.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.784
Dr. Walden.

05:23.255 --> 05:27.885
I got a call this morning
from the State Preservation Society.

05:28.060 --> 05:31.120
They heard a rumor that you plan
on removing a section of the wall.

05:31.931 --> 05:37.369
Now, I told them you wouldn't consider
such a radical move without consulting me.

05:37.536 --> 05:39.367
It's a common archeological practice.

05:40.172 --> 05:42.470
Among 19th-century imperialists.

05:43.509 --> 05:47.104
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were
trying to cut me out of the process.

05:47.279 --> 05:48.837
You're paranoid.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.409
Really?

05:53.018 --> 05:57.011
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't fire you right now.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.188
Because I'm on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

06:00.359 --> 06:03.886
Will this breakthrough finally allow you
to translate these symbols?

06:10.035 --> 06:12.162
Who tipped off the state?

06:14.206 --> 06:19.041
The state is threatening to revoke LexCorp's
custodial management of the cave.

06:19.211 --> 06:22.044
Another foundation is chomping
at the bit to take over.

06:22.214 --> 06:25.274
If my instincts are correct,
I believe my father is behind it.

06:25.451 --> 06:28.511
I don't need excuses, I need answers.

06:28.687 --> 06:30.518
You've got three days.

06:34.093 --> 06:37.153
What a lame assignment.
Family trees are so 20th century.

06:37.329 --> 06:40.389
Look at it as a mystery. You never know
what you're gonna uncover.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.399
- Why are you so excited?
- It's gonna be a piece of cake.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.299
Your family's been in Smallville
since the Jurassic era.

06:46.472 --> 06:47.803
What are you worked up about?

06:47.973 --> 06:51.431
There's just so many variables, like
what if your mother abandoned you...

06:51.610 --> 06:54.044
...is that branch of your family tree cut off?

06:54.213 --> 06:56.238
What if your biological father comes back...

06:56.415 --> 06:57.746
...which family do you claim?

06:57.917 --> 07:00.909
- What if you're adopted?
- Hey, okay, I get the point...

07:01.086 --> 07:03.850
...but is it my fault that I'm part
of a nuclear family?

07:04.256 --> 07:06.190
Is it? Later.

07:06.358 --> 07:09.657
Unfortunately for the rest of us,
nuclear family was nuked years ago.

07:09.828 --> 07:13.355
We should get together at the Talon
tomorrow and figure out a game plan.

07:16.835 --> 07:18.632
Clark doesn't like that idea.

07:21.607 --> 07:22.767
Do you guys hear that?

07:23.142 --> 07:24.632
Hear what?

07:30.149 --> 07:31.343
That.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.975
Apparently you're part canine,
because we don't hear anything.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.356
- Clark, what is it?
- I gotta go.

10:10.008 --> 10:11.202
Clark...

10:13.579 --> 10:14.841
...are you okay?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.810
Lex, what happened?

10:17.983 --> 10:19.610
I was hoping you could tell me.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.184
What were you doing down here?

10:29.194 --> 10:34.097
Just finishing up some work for Dr. Walden,
figured I'd do it while it was quiet...

10:34.566 --> 10:36.693
...next thing I know
you're shaking me awake.

10:37.736 --> 10:39.863
The guard said there was an explosion.

10:40.038 --> 10:41.972
You didn't touch any equipment, did you?

10:42.141 --> 10:45.941
I find it interesting that you managed
to get around the guard in the first place.

10:46.111 --> 10:49.547
- What's your secret, Mr. Kent?
- Back off, doctor.

10:50.182 --> 10:53.481
- Can't you see he's been hurt?
- I'm okay, I just need to get some air.

10:54.920 --> 10:56.217
Clark.

10:56.388 --> 10:58.982
First I find you lying in the road,
and now here.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.149
- You should get to the hospital.
- I'm fine.

11:01.326 --> 11:04.352
I just gotta get home
before my parents start to worry.

11:05.664 --> 11:06.995
Okay...

11:07.166 --> 11:10.897
...but until we figure out what happened,
I don't want you down here by yourself.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.200
I'm sorry I couldn't be more help.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.435
Why'd you let him walk out of here?

11:19.611 --> 11:21.306
He knows more than he's telling us.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.777
Probably.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.439
But you've got enough
on your plate, doctor.

11:25.617 --> 11:28.108
Let me worry about Clark Kent.

11:30.489 --> 11:35.426
Hey, my hard drive just crashed. I was
wondering if I could borrow your computer.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.619
I need to get a start on this assignment.

11:37.796 --> 11:40.128
Yeah, sure, I was just
turning everything off.

11:40.465 --> 11:42.365
So, what are you, a Lang or a Small?

11:42.534 --> 11:45.970
Right now I'm committing
to my mother's side of the family.

11:46.138 --> 11:48.003
Knock yourself out.
I'll see you at home?

11:48.173 --> 11:51.404
- Yeah. Chloe, you're a lifesaver.
- Of course.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.374
Did you give up on genealogy
or is my personal life more interesting?

12:26.111 --> 12:29.603
- I was just looking...
- So you decided to snoop around.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.488
Chloe, I'm sorry.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.322
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what way?

12:41.493 --> 12:46.487
Like I'm some loser who's trying to hang on
to something that she's never even had.

12:48.734 --> 12:51.635
If you have feelings for Clark,
maybe you should just tell him.

12:51.803 --> 12:53.600
This isn't about me and Clark, Lana.

12:54.873 --> 13:00.675
This is about you violating my privacy. This
office and everything in it is now off-limits.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.643
Oh, and by the way...

13:09.288 --> 13:10.983
...I did tell Clark how I felt.

13:11.556 --> 13:14.024
I poured my heart out to him
when he was sick.

13:14.192 --> 13:17.719
And in his delirium,
the one name he called out...

13:17.896 --> 13:19.454
...was "Lana."

13:28.173 --> 13:29.435
Well, you're up early.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.304
Don't worry, Dad, I woke up
in my own bed this morning.

13:32.477 --> 13:33.967
No dreams?

13:35.047 --> 13:36.639
No, I think whatever it is passed.

13:36.815 --> 13:38.373
That's good.

13:38.650 --> 13:41.278
I'm taking your mother in for her
checkup, want a ride?

13:41.453 --> 13:43.478
- No, Chloe's gonna pick me up.
- Great.

13:43.655 --> 13:46.215
- How's Mom feeling?
- Pregnant.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.993
- I still can't believe it.
- How soon can we start telling everyone?

13:52.264 --> 13:54.323
As soon as your mother says she's ready.

13:54.499 --> 13:57.297
Don't worry, this secret
we can all be very happy to share.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.699
Yeah, the baby's lucky.

14:00.972 --> 14:03.998
Hey, son, I didn't mean
for it to sound that way.

14:04.943 --> 14:07.639
This child is going to be
a big adjustment for all of us...

14:07.813 --> 14:10.441
...but it doesn't change
the way we feel about you.

14:10.749 --> 14:12.182
I know that.

14:13.785 --> 14:16.310
I'm just glad things are back to normal.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.752
Jonathan, we're late, we've gotta go!

14:46.418 --> 14:47.680
Jonathan!

14:57.028 --> 14:58.791
I'll get it, I'll get it, go on!

15:05.971 --> 15:08.371
- Clark, what happened?
- I don't know!

15:17.349 --> 15:18.509
What happened?

15:18.683 --> 15:20.810
We came out and it was...

15:22.354 --> 15:23.981
...on fire.

15:56.688 --> 16:00.215
That ought to keep lookers away till
we have a chance to patch it up better.

16:00.392 --> 16:03.225
A couple of boards won't be able
to cover anything up anymore.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.590
Especially after Chloe
publishes her pictures.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.164
Well, I think I convinced her it was a prank.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.664
You can't beat yourself up.
Your abilities are still developing.

16:11.837 --> 16:13.361
You can't always control them.

16:14.539 --> 16:17.201
There's nothing uncontrolled
about that drawing.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.935
It's a symbol from wherever I'm from.

16:21.746 --> 16:23.304
It means "hope."

16:24.449 --> 16:26.007
How do you know that?

16:26.685 --> 16:28.448
Since when can you read the symbols?

16:31.022 --> 16:33.252
Since I put the key in the cave wall.

16:36.294 --> 16:37.921
Wait a minute.

16:38.930 --> 16:41.057
- Since you did what?
- It was calling out to me.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.598
It led me to where you hid it.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.291
- I told you not to.
- I know, Dad.

16:44.469 --> 16:47.302
- It was like I didn't have a choice.
- Where is the key now?

16:48.306 --> 16:52.072
I don't know. When I put the key in,
there was a blinding light and I blacked out.

16:52.244 --> 16:53.836
- Are you all right?
- It didn't hurt.

16:54.012 --> 16:55.536
But everything's jumbled up.

16:55.814 --> 16:59.250
It's like it downloaded me
with the language from the cave wall.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.112
Did anybody see you?

17:01.820 --> 17:04.345
I don't think so,
but Lex and Dr. Walden found me.

17:04.955 --> 17:07.617
I don't think they have the key.
I think it disintegrated.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.487
You're not 100 percent sure?

17:14.866 --> 17:17.835
Clark, we understand you wanting
to know more about your origins.

17:18.002 --> 17:21.461
- But you're putting your life in danger.
- Some things are worth the risk.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.938
- Like what?
- Like the truth.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.079
Clark.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.119
Earth to Clark.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.892
Are you okay?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.865
I heard about the fire.

17:50.035 --> 17:51.935
It's no big deal.
We got it under control.

17:52.103 --> 17:54.867
I think Chloe's over at the Torch
writing an exclusive.

17:55.073 --> 17:58.372
I wouldn't know. Her and I aren't
exactly talking right now.

17:58.643 --> 17:59.837
Sounds serious.

18:00.345 --> 18:02.973
Well, invasion of privacy usually is.

18:03.515 --> 18:06.712
Let me guess. You caught her
snooping around in your stuff.

18:07.786 --> 18:11.813
Actually, I was the one doing the snooping.
I didn't mean to, kind of just happened.

18:12.090 --> 18:16.493
You'd think all the times she's overstepped
the boundaries, she'd cut you some slack.

18:17.562 --> 18:20.554
Just reminded me that as great as
Chloe and her dad have been...

18:20.732 --> 18:22.529
...I'm still not family.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.996
Yeah, I know what you mean.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.631
Can I tell you a secret?

18:32.143 --> 18:34.168
That would be a first.

18:36.781 --> 18:39.750
I've been looking into my roots
and it's freaking my parents out.

18:39.918 --> 18:43.217
But I think I'm getting close
to finding out where I'm from.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.120
Then you shouldn't stop.

18:52.964 --> 18:54.522
Is that your family tree?

18:59.237 --> 19:00.829
Clark, what's wrong?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.373
Nothing. I gotta go.

19:05.944 --> 19:09.641
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Sorry, Lex, I can't talk right now.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.714
Looks like we've been abandoned.

19:17.288 --> 19:19.051
Story of my life.

19:32.737 --> 19:37.697
Lex, I may decipher ancient languages, but
cryptic phone messages don't amuse me.

19:37.876 --> 19:40.344
You're aware that
I'm on a very tight deadline.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.174
I thought you might find this enlightening.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.642
What is it?

19:45.216 --> 19:49.949
I'd say somebody has gained knowledge
of the language that's carved in the cave.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.253
These characters are similar...

19:53.858 --> 19:56.156
...but there's no way
to verify their accuracy.

19:56.327 --> 19:58.522
See, these symbols
could be "father"...

19:58.697 --> 20:00.130
...or "mother"...

20:00.298 --> 20:02.630
...or they could just be chicken scratch.

20:03.134 --> 20:04.931
Where'd you get it?

20:05.937 --> 20:07.370
Clark Kent.

20:08.339 --> 20:10.398
What is it with you and this kid, Lex?

20:11.009 --> 20:13.341
I'm a top expert in my field
and I'm telling you...

20:13.511 --> 20:15.570
...these walls will take years to translate.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.739
Some Kansas farm boy's scribblings
don't change that.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.951
Then how do you explain this?

20:23.154 --> 20:25.054
I'd say that was more than scribbling.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.885
That's one of the symbols
on the octagonal disk.

20:30.995 --> 20:33.293
Maybe the whole thing's a hoax.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.330
No.

20:36.167 --> 20:37.532
It's no hoax.

20:37.702 --> 20:40.170
Something happened to Clark in that cave.

20:40.338 --> 20:42.329
Well, what do you suggest I do?

20:42.507 --> 20:46.500
Put your extravagant ego aside
and work with the boy.

20:46.678 --> 20:49.112
He may be a fraud, doctor...

20:49.814 --> 20:53.306
...or he just might be the Rosetta stone
we've been looking for.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.056
I'd like to thank you
for turning our farm into Area 51.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.825
We needed a couple of deputies
to keep the wackos away.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.833
Sorry, Clark.
You have to admit, it is really intriguing.

21:12.003 --> 21:13.470
It's probably a K.U. Frat prank.

21:13.638 --> 21:17.938
Or aliens think that crop circles are passe
so they've moved on to barn scorchings?

21:18.543 --> 21:22.775
Come on, Clark, this is Smallville.
I mean, you have to consider the possibility.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.920
I'll let it go if you forgive Lana
for what she did.

21:33.158 --> 21:34.853
Why didn't I see this coming?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.121
Did she tell you what she was doing?

21:37.295 --> 21:39.627
No, but she did tell me she was very sorry.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.356
- I can't believe...
- You know what?

21:41.533 --> 21:44.627
This is one time when you don't need
to come to Lana's rescue.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.237
Hello.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.373
What's this?

21:55.113 --> 21:56.774
Someone spammed your e-mail account.

21:57.248 --> 21:58.647
But they're all for you.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.948
From someone called "Swann"?

22:03.154 --> 22:04.587
Never heard of him.

22:19.938 --> 22:22.031
- Did my parents see you?
- No.

22:23.908 --> 22:25.933
What's with all this cloak-and-dagger stuff?

22:26.110 --> 22:28.340
How come we didn't just use
Chloe's computer?

22:28.947 --> 22:32.610
I can't have her looking over my shoulder
if this Swann has information for me.

22:34.018 --> 22:35.212
Come on.

22:36.421 --> 22:37.752
Okay, you're on.

23:02.847 --> 23:04.178
What's wrong?

23:05.683 --> 23:07.150
What if my parents are right?

23:07.318 --> 23:10.082
Dude, we can just pull the plug
on this whole thing.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.790
I need to know.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.977
What's that?

23:40.451 --> 23:42.009
It says, ; ; I'm a friend."

25:06.637 --> 25:09.299
Dr. Walden!
Dr. Walden.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.441
Dr. Walden.

25:34.299 --> 25:35.857
How's he doing?

25:37.302 --> 25:39.395
Doctors have never seen anything like it.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.465
He's completely catatonic.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.172
Is he gonna be okay?

25:45.711 --> 25:48.976
It's impossible to determine
without knowing the cause.

25:49.981 --> 25:54.577
Three mysterious events in three days
and you were there on each occasion.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.981
That's a mystery unto itself,
don't you think?

25:59.358 --> 26:00.757
Not really.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.622
What about that language?
You sure you can't read it?

26:03.795 --> 26:05.262
What would give you that idea?

26:05.430 --> 26:07.921
The symbol on your barn and this.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.098
Just doodling,
it doesn't mean anything.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.532
- Looks pretty specific to me.
- Lex.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.368
Why do you care about a
Native American language?

26:15.540 --> 26:17.405
I don't think it's Native American.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.908
I don't even think it's from this planet.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.744
You think aliens wrote it?

26:25.817 --> 26:27.808
I'd keep that to yourself, Lex.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.718
I'm looking for a Clark Kent.

26:31.356 --> 26:33.119
That's me.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.455
Sign here.

26:38.063 --> 26:39.291
How'd you know I'd be here?

26:39.464 --> 26:42.058
My instructions were to
deliver that to you personally.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.666
Lucky for me, small town.

26:48.473 --> 26:50.270
Aren't you gonna open it?

26:51.009 --> 26:54.240
It's probably just junk mail.
I'll open it later.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.696
Dr. Virgil Swann.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.930
- You're being stalked by a legend.
- I've never heard of him.

27:22.107 --> 27:24.541
He was a high-tech
Howard Hughes 30 years ago.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.973
He graduated from MIT when he was 19.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.773
He had his doctorate
in math and applied physics.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.813
Then he started Swann Communications...

27:31.983 --> 27:34.816
...which quickly rose to
international acclaim in the '70s...

27:34.986 --> 27:37.284
...as the world's largest producer
of satellites.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.356
This guy has so much hardware in space...

27:39.524 --> 27:42.015
...Scientific American dubbed him
"Man of Tomorrow."

27:42.194 --> 27:44.458
"Only through communication
will we live in peace."

27:44.629 --> 27:48.030
- Sounds like a remarkable guy.
- He was, until he pulled a J.D. Salinger.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.169
Sold his company and put millions
towards charitable foundations.

27:51.336 --> 27:56.433
Rumor has it he devoted himself to searching
for signs of intelligent life in the universe.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.901
The address on the card,
how does that fit in?

27:59.077 --> 28:00.408
The New York Planetarium.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.914
What better place
to look for little green men?

28:06.418 --> 28:08.978
Why is this guy so interested in you, Clark?

28:09.354 --> 28:10.946
He's not interested in me...

28:11.122 --> 28:14.216
...he's just interested in my barn.

28:15.026 --> 28:18.484
Virgil Swann hasn't made
a phone call in 13 years...

28:18.663 --> 28:21.632
...and now, all of a sudden,
he wants to be your best friend?

28:23.568 --> 28:25.627
He must think that symbol's
pretty important.

28:28.673 --> 28:30.106
It's just a hoax.

28:31.309 --> 28:34.710
Yeah, well, one of the most brilliant men
in the world disagrees.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.246
If I were you, I'd find out why.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.821
Has there been a change
in his condition?

28:48.994 --> 28:52.088
Whatever he was exposed to
over-stimulated his cerebral cortex...

28:52.264 --> 28:53.788
...causing a massive seizure.

28:53.965 --> 28:56.195
He suffered from information overload?

28:56.368 --> 28:58.359
In layman's terms, yes.

28:58.770 --> 29:01.466
It's doubtful he'll ever regain
consciousness.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.537
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.340
Don't worry, doctor.

29:11.550 --> 29:14.280
One day you'll share your secrets with me.

29:21.526 --> 29:24.859
If you're planning to run away from home,
you might wanna pack lighter.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.330
This isn't my home, Chloe.

29:27.499 --> 29:32.061
As great as you and your dad have been,
I don't think this was such a great idea.

29:32.337 --> 29:36.296
You know, Lana, if this is about
the whole computer incident, I'm sorry.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.809
I overreacted, I know...

29:38.977 --> 29:41.502
...but when it comes to Clark...

29:42.647 --> 29:45.639
...and my feelings, I...

29:45.884 --> 29:48.375
I'm never really rational.

29:50.288 --> 29:53.883
- I can't help the way Clark feels about me.
- I know.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.994
Before you go,
I just wanted to show you something.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.300
It's my family tree.

30:10.508 --> 30:13.409
You put me under "sister."

30:15.180 --> 30:16.647
Why?

30:18.483 --> 30:23.750
Because I decided that my family wasn't
about the people that didn't love me...

30:23.922 --> 30:25.787
...it's about the people who do love me.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.054
No matter what.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.818
My friends.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.394
Clark, this whole thing is very suspicious.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.434
He knows how to read the language.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.231
According to you, he does.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.306
How do we know you're reading it right?

30:43.475 --> 30:46.273
We have no idea
what that cave did to you, son.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.543
Mom, help me out here.

30:48.713 --> 30:50.840
We don't know anything
about this Dr. Swann.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.883
The whole thing could be
an elaborate plan just to get to you.

30:54.052 --> 30:56.077
Now you're just being paranoid.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.448
Did you ever think maybe
he just wanted to help?

30:58.623 --> 31:00.215
No, Clark, I haven't.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.984
When it comes to protecting you...

31:02.160 --> 31:05.652
...all I've seen are people who want
to exploit you for their personal gain.

31:05.830 --> 31:08.799
- You can't protect me forever!
- I'm not ready to give that up.

31:14.039 --> 31:18.135
Clark, we're not trying to keep you
from learning about your past.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.675
We just don't want to see you
get hurt, either.

31:22.681 --> 31:26.640
I've got all these questions and I can't
leave them in the storm cellar anymore.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.186
Why did my parents put me in that ship?

31:32.357 --> 31:34.689
What was so bad
they had to send me away?

31:40.265 --> 31:41.664
I have to do this.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.999
Then let's go together, we'll go as a family.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.502
Dad, I have to go alone.

31:54.546 --> 31:55.979
It's the only way.

32:05.824 --> 32:09.385
No matter what I find out, it is not going
to change how I feel about you.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.630
You're still gonna be my mom and dad.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.446
Hello?

32:42.127 --> 32:44.254
Hello, Dr. Swann.

32:49.768 --> 32:53.499
- What am I doing here?
- Looking for answers, I assume.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.253
Hello, Clark.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.961
I've been expecting you.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.424
You're probably wondering
why a billionaire scientist...

33:21.633 --> 33:23.794
...works in the back room
of a planetarium.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.199
The thought had crossed my mind.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.497
Well, I find it peaceful.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.071
Besides, I own the building.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.704
Activate screen.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.615
Does any of that look familiar?

33:49.294 --> 33:50.556
What is it?

33:51.763 --> 33:53.958
It's a message from the stars, Clark.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.560
All my life I've been staring out
into space, wondering.

33:58.102 --> 34:00.434
Wondering, "Is anybody else
out there?" And then...

34:00.905 --> 34:03.135
...thirteen years ago, I got an answer.

34:03.441 --> 34:04.965
Day of the meteor shower.

34:07.045 --> 34:10.503
One of my receiving stations
picked up a faint signal.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.914
Took me years to decrypt it...

34:14.252 --> 34:18.245
...and finally I discovered
a mathematical key...

34:18.590 --> 34:21.184
...that was built into the transmission.

34:21.759 --> 34:23.522
- Can you read it?
- Yes.

34:23.695 --> 34:27.654
It says, "This is Kal-el of Krypton.

34:28.366 --> 34:31.164
Our infant son, our last hope.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.704
Please protect him
and deliver him from evil."

34:41.312 --> 34:42.973
Kal-el.

34:44.949 --> 34:46.280
Krypton.

34:46.451 --> 34:50.012
I've always wondered
what happened to that child.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.155
Did he survive the journey?

34:52.489 --> 34:53.855
If he lived among us.

34:54.058 --> 34:58.290
And then, three days ago,
I saw the symbol for hope...

34:58.463 --> 35:01.193
...burned onto the side
of a barn in Smallville.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.890
And I found out
that the farmer and his wife...

35:04.202 --> 35:06.500
...had an adopted son.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.568
So you think I'm Kal-el?

35:14.012 --> 35:15.377
I'm just Clark Kent.

35:15.546 --> 35:18.811
No, no, no, I'm not trying
to expose you, Clark, I'm just...

35:19.217 --> 35:21.811
I'm just seeking the truth.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.880
Sorry, doctor.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.490
The truth is I'm not who you think I am.

35:28.026 --> 35:30.654
If you can live with that decision, so can I.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.758
But...

35:33.932 --> 35:35.797
...if you walk out that door...

35:36.734 --> 35:38.827
...it'll never be open to you again.

35:43.374 --> 35:46.241
Then you'll never know
the second part of the message.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.741
Tell me something, doctor...

35:55.086 --> 35:56.917
...why are you doing this to me?

35:57.889 --> 36:00.483
We all have our windmills, Clark.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.488
I need to know I'm right.

36:04.429 --> 36:06.363
Once I do, it'll never leave this room.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.637
Show me.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.302
Second screen.

36:20.912 --> 36:23.312
; ; We will be with you, Kal-el.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.116
For all the days of your life."

36:29.187 --> 36:30.484
What does this mean?

36:30.655 --> 36:32.282
I'm not sure, but...

36:32.557 --> 36:35.720
...one thing I've learned about science
is the value of patience.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.860
Is that where Krypton is?

36:43.034 --> 36:45.969
No, that's where Krypton was.

36:46.437 --> 36:49.668
I followed the signal's path
billions of miles out into space.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.833
I was hoping to discover
its origin, but instead...

36:54.012 --> 36:56.640
...I found nothing.

37:01.252 --> 37:02.742
Planets just don't disappear.

37:10.194 --> 37:11.456
What do you think happened?

37:11.629 --> 37:14.325
Oh, could be any one of a million
different scenarios.

37:14.499 --> 37:17.627
War, famine, disease.

37:18.369 --> 37:20.803
I mean, look at the world around us.

37:22.306 --> 37:23.898
Is it really that hard to believe?

37:27.011 --> 37:29.946
Well, I can't be the only one.
There must be others like me.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.378
There was only one message.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.252
Why me?

37:41.426 --> 37:44.293
There must be a reason
why I was sent to this planet.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.254
You won't find the answers
by looking to the stars.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.926
It's a journey you'll have to take
by looking inside yourself.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.472
You must write your own destiny...

37:55.940 --> 37:57.237
...Kal-el.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.332
Your mother told me you were back.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.311
Clark.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.575
I know that whatever Dr. Swann
told you must be...

38:40.785 --> 38:42.753
...overwhelming, but...

38:44.522 --> 38:47.582
...if you need to talk about it,
your mother and I are always here.

38:53.030 --> 38:56.989
Ever since you told me about the ship,
I wondered if there were others like me.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.767
Now I know there's not.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.297
I'm totally alone.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.146
Clark.

39:13.384 --> 39:15.215
You're never alone, son.

39:16.020 --> 39:19.114
This is your home
and we love you very much.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.556
- Come on, let's go back up.
- In a minute.

39:37.742 --> 39:39.676
I figured out what this is.

39:45.983 --> 39:47.507
It's the ship's heart.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.748
Really?

39:58.396 --> 39:59.590
Have you used it yet?

40:01.666 --> 40:03.224
I didn't want to do it alone.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.267
Let's do it together.

40:44.675 --> 40:47.508
It's hard to believe
you were ever that small.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.567
What is it, son?

41:21.579 --> 41:24.673
It's a message from my biological father.

41:26.317 --> 41:29.582
- I'm sure I'm reading it wrong.
- Why, what does it say?

41:31.622 --> 41:33.920
; ; On this third planet from this star...

41:34.091 --> 41:37.185
...Sol, you will be a god among men.

41:38.596 --> 41:43.659
They are a flawed race, rule them with
strength. That is where your greatness lies."

41:50.174 --> 41:52.734
I think I was sent here to conquer.

41:55.913 --> 41:58.381
What kind of planet am I from?

41:59.150 --> 42:02.642
Maybe you did misread it, Clark,
but even if you didn't...

42:02.820 --> 42:05.618
...it's you who decides
what kind of life you're gonna lead.

42:05.790 --> 42:08.054
Not me, not your mother, not your...

42:08.225 --> 42:09.715
...biological parents.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.155
What if it's part of who I am?

42:12.330 --> 42:14.321
Is that the kind of person I will become?

42:14.498 --> 42:16.864
Clark Kent, you're here
to be a force for good.

42:17.034 --> 42:20.128
- Not a force for evil.
- But how can you be so sure?

42:20.304 --> 42:22.272
Because I am your father.

42:22.440 --> 42:26.467
I raised you and I know you
better than anyone.

43:06.217 --> 43:07.741
