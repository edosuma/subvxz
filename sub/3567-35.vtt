00:35.362 --> 00:40.533
Hmmm...
hmmmm-hmmm...

00:40.618 --> 00:43.453
- You can do it, Steven.
- Thanks Sadie.

00:43.504 --> 00:46.089
It's just...
I could get a donut, which

00:46.173 --> 00:48.625
would be tasty.
But I always get donuts.

00:48.676 --> 00:52.262
Shouldn't I be living life to
the fullest and trying new things?

00:52.263 --> 00:55.848
So tonight, maybe I'm
thinking... spicy pretzels?

00:55.933 --> 00:57.884
Why don't you ask your little friend?

01:03.140 --> 01:05.224
Ugh, lion those are gross.

01:05.309 --> 01:08.061
- No offense.
- You kids better hurry it up.

01:08.145 --> 01:10.130
Lars and I are closing up...

01:18.289 --> 01:22.125
I'm closing up for the day.

01:22.159 --> 01:25.461
Hey, Sadie!
There's a snack named after you?

01:25.546 --> 01:28.798
Nah, those are all lunches
my mom packed for me.

01:28.832 --> 01:32.669
- Aww, that's so nice!
- Eh... actually, it's pretty

01:32.753 --> 01:35.421
embarrassing. She's
been doing it for years.

01:35.506 --> 01:37.390
I mean, I know how to feed myself!

01:37.474 --> 01:40.560
They just make me feel
like a kid, you know?

01:40.678 --> 01:42.679
- Can I try one?
- Sure.

01:42.763 --> 01:44.935
But choose wisely.
Some of those have been

01:44.999 --> 01:46.582
in there for a few months.

01:46.817 --> 01:49.652
Alrighty, let's
see what we got here.

01:49.687 --> 01:52.739
Look like a classic PBJ
sandwich cut into triangles!

01:52.823 --> 01:56.159
Very nice! It's the only
shape a sandwich should be.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.495
<i>Mama Sadie, this lunch is a win!
And for dessert we have...</i>

01:59.530 --> 02:01.614
<i>Whoa! Look at this!</i>

02:01.699 --> 02:04.701
Lion! Lion look!
It's a cookie shaped like a star!

02:06.787 --> 02:09.339
I guess you could say this cookie is...

02:09.372 --> 02:11.374
out of this world. Eh?

02:16.847 --> 02:19.716
I wonder what kind of lunch
my mom would've made me?

02:19.800 --> 02:24.220
Maybe actual space cookies!

02:24.305 --> 02:29.726
I just wish...
I knew a little more about her.

02:33.447 --> 02:36.099
Blink if this means you love me!

02:38.285 --> 02:39.902
He loves me!

02:40.738 --> 02:42.872
All done!
I made sure to make it extra

02:42.906 --> 02:44.991
skooshy, just the way you like it!

02:45.075 --> 02:47.577
Wha... hey!

02:47.661 --> 02:49.962
Hey, get out of there!

02:50.047 --> 02:53.249
Lion, this is the Steven
bed not the lion bed!

02:53.334 --> 02:54.834
Come on!

02:54.918 --> 02:59.505
Whoa!
Hey! That's mine too!

02:59.590 --> 03:02.346
And Sir Bearington.

03:05.995 --> 03:09.265
<i>'Night lion!</i>

03:09.316 --> 03:15.502
Love you...
in the morning.

03:20.611 --> 03:24.280
<i>Whoa...
What is this place?</i>

03:24.415 --> 03:26.916
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

03:27.350 --> 03:30.787
<i>Steven!
Steven! Steven! Steven!</i>

03:30.838 --> 03:32.955
Steven! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

03:33.006 --> 03:35.017
Hang on! I got you!

03:35.106 --> 03:38.422
Ugh, lion! Let him go!

03:40.547 --> 03:44.434
- What happened?
- Steven, are you all right?

03:44.468 --> 03:47.387
Why was lion sleeping on top of you?

03:47.471 --> 03:50.536
I don't know.
He's being a little clingy today.

03:50.557 --> 03:53.393
But that's cause I'm his
favorite! Oh!

03:53.477 --> 03:54.560
<i>See? Wait...</i>

03:54.645 --> 03:57.280
Why are you here, Pearl?

03:57.364 --> 03:59.315
Me?
Nothing. I was just uh...

03:59.400 --> 04:01.401
well, you know how I always say...

04:01.485 --> 04:04.987
um, I just uh...
I like to watch you sleep

04:05.072 --> 04:08.771
sometimes. And by
sometimes I mean often.

04:09.176 --> 04:12.204
Okeydokey, it's time
for everyone to leave Steven alone.

04:12.312 --> 04:16.245
I'm a growing boy
and I needs my rest.

04:19.269 --> 04:22.896
Lion, that means you too.

04:24.657 --> 04:27.443

04:41.368 --> 04:43.870
W-what?!
That was a good move.

04:43.954 --> 04:46.789
- Thanks.
- Dogcopter, how do you do it?

04:46.874 --> 04:50.593
- How do I do what?
- I mean, what's your secret?

04:50.677 --> 04:53.713
- How'd you get so talented?
- Don't focus so much on

04:53.797 --> 04:57.425
talent, Steven. Making art
is all about communication.

04:57.426 --> 05:01.053
A piece of art is a conversation.
Every choice you make

05:01.104 --> 05:03.890
is a statement.

05:03.941 --> 05:06.859
Don't worry about labels
or conforming to a standard.

05:06.894 --> 05:09.979
Just be true to yourself and
people will appreciate

05:10.063 --> 05:11.781
your honesty.
Ahh.

05:11.865 --> 05:14.700
Whoa...
Thanks for the advice.

05:14.735 --> 05:18.821
- And take a deep breath.
- What?

05:22.159 --> 05:26.546
<i>Here again?
I don't know what this place is</i>

05:26.580 --> 05:31.834
<i>but it feels...familiar.
Why can't I breathe?</i>

05:31.919 --> 05:34.921
<i>Wait a minute... Lion!</i>

05:38.809 --> 05:42.929
Lion, my face is not your bed!
What's going on with you?

05:43.842 --> 05:45.498
You just wanted a belly rub?

05:46.099 --> 05:49.435
You never let me touch
your belly! Oh!

05:50.813 --> 05:52.104
It's a trap!

05:53.532 --> 05:54.824
An adorable trap!

05:56.301 --> 05:57.693
Okay you got me!

05:57.778 --> 06:01.281
Will you let me go?

06:01.615 --> 06:03.445
Come on now!

06:04.701 --> 06:06.786
That's it!

06:06.837 --> 06:11.123
Let's go lion, you're on a time out!

06:11.208 --> 06:15.595
I said, you're on time out!
You're gonna stay out here

06:15.629 --> 06:19.687
and think about what you did!

06:31.228 --> 06:34.113
He loves me!

06:34.147 --> 06:36.532
Aww, I just can't stay mad at you!

06:36.617 --> 06:38.901
You're a wonderful pink human being.

06:38.986 --> 06:42.905
Except you're not.
'Cause you're a lion.

06:59.006 --> 07:02.058
<i>I'm inside lion's mane?!</i>

07:14.134 --> 07:18.190
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

07:18.275 --> 07:21.777
<i>Am I...
supposed to do something here?</i>

07:21.862 --> 07:23.446
<i>Wha ...?</i>

07:30.037 --> 07:32.838
<i>Mm... </i>

07:52.225 --> 07:54.777
<i>For me?
Who would put this here?</i>

07:54.895 --> 07:58.064
<i>And how does this huge place
fit inside of lion's mane anyw ...</i>

07:58.115 --> 08:01.450
<i>Mm...</i>

08:06.974 --> 08:10.418
...and he keeps
sleeping on Steven's face!

08:10.419 --> 08:13.127
But Steven doesn't want me
watching him anymore.

08:13.205 --> 08:15.881
<i>So one of you two has to do it.</i>

08:20.170 --> 08:22.972
- Sadie! Sadie!
- Steven, you know donuts

08:23.056 --> 08:26.092
aren't ready for another hour.

08:26.143 --> 08:28.575
Really? Come on!

08:49.183 --> 08:50.533
<i>What are you doing?</i>

08:50.617 --> 08:55.788
Steven, that voice.

08:55.839 --> 08:59.208
<i>Greg made a friend.</i>

08:59.292 --> 09:02.011
<i>What?! Ah!</i>

09:06.967 --> 09:09.301
<i>- Go on...
- Sorry, I'm getting stage</i>

09:09.352 --> 09:12.021
<i>- fright here.
- Tell us about yourself.</i>

09:12.105 --> 09:15.691
<i>Well, let's see here...
My name is Greg.</i>

09:15.776 --> 09:17.670
<i>No, no, no! This is all wrong!</i>

09:17.932 --> 09:20.062
<i>Okay, go!</i>

09:20.147 --> 09:22.815
<i>They call me...</i>

09:22.949 --> 09:26.619
<i>Mr. Universe! Get
ready baby, you're gonna</i>

09:26.653 --> 09:29.155
<i>have the coolest dad
this side of the cosmos!</i>

09:31.617 --> 09:33.993
<i>Press the button, Rose!</i>

09:34.077 --> 09:37.663
<i>Oh, right!
Was that the right one?</i>

09:37.748 --> 09:41.167
<i>- Uh... maybe?
- Oh, what does this one do?</i>

09:43.920 --> 09:46.547
<i>Isn't it remarkable, Steven?</i>

09:46.548 --> 09:49.877
<i>This world is full of
so many possibilities.</i>

09:49.878 --> 09:54.872
<i>Each living thing has an
entirely unique experience.</i>

09:54.873 --> 09:57.016
<i>The sights they see,
the sounds they hear.</i>

09:57.067 --> 10:01.187
<i> The lives they live are so</i>

10:01.271 --> 10:04.907
<i>complicated... a-and so simple.</i>

10:04.991 --> 10:08.054
<i>I can't wait for you to join them.</i>

10:08.857 --> 10:12.796
<i>Steven, we can't both exist.</i>

10:12.797 --> 10:16.735
<i>I'm going to become half of you.</i>

10:16.803 --> 10:20.005
<i>And I need you to know that
every moment you love being</i>

10:20.073 --> 10:25.077
<i>yourself, that's me, loving
you and loving being you.</i>

10:25.145 --> 10:30.015
<i>Because you're going to
be something extraordinary.</i>

10:30.050 --> 10:33.135
<i>You're going to be a human being.</i>

10:33.220 --> 10:37.223
<i>- Hey, Rose!
- Take care of them, Steven.</i>

10:48.118 --> 10:52.288
Hey, Sadie, come on we got to open up!

11:01.081 --> 11:03.415
What in the world did you guys watch?

11:09.089 --> 11:12.398
Hey, mom?
You know how I said you didn't

11:12.437 --> 11:14.158
have to make me those lunches anymore?
