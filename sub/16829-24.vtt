00:01.769 --> 00:03.402
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
(Happy gasps)

00:03.404 --> 00:05.337
I know this is not a good
time, but we have a case.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.406
The government
of French Polynesia needs help

00:07.408 --> 00:11.243
setting up their underwater
wave-powered generators.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.444
They're willing to fly us

00:12.446 --> 00:13.512
to Tahiti.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.081
(plane rattling)

00:16.083 --> 00:17.449
We've lost power.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.218
Buckle up and brace yourselves;
we're going down!

00:20.388 --> 00:21.720
SYLVESTER:
<i> If rescuers don't find us,</i>

00:21.722 --> 00:23.288
we don't find a
fresh water source,

00:23.290 --> 00:24.723
we'll be dead in three days.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.526
You know, my wife is due
in three weeks.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.795
I don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.663
Portugal?
You didn't know
Happy used to live there?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.549
Oh, me neither.

00:33.550 --> 00:35.434
I only learned the language
so I could record my single.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.202
Hey, Walt, have
you seen Sly?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.505
He's still in the bunker.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.573
And I think he's kind of
losing his mind.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.409
What's that, Mitchell?

00:43.411 --> 00:47.312
We can't eat Cabe.
That'd be crazy.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.816
SYLVESTER:
<i> I write this journal</i>

00:50.818 --> 00:53.285
<i> in hopes someone learns</i>
<i> of our fate,</i>

00:53.287 --> 00:57.356
<i>because I believe the tale will</i>
<i> never be told by any of us.</i>

00:57.358 --> 00:59.658
<i> You might think that crashing</i>
<i> onto a deserted island</i>

00:59.660 --> 01:02.494
<i> would cause</i>
<i> despondency and panic.</i>

01:02.496 --> 01:07.399
<i> But the truth is, early on,</i>
<i> things were far from bleak.</i>

01:07.401 --> 01:08.700
CABE: Ugh, this is
gonna take forever.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.235
We do not have
forever.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.703
We got two days worth
of bottled water,

01:11.705 --> 01:13.505
one soda and no options.

01:13.507 --> 01:16.375
We need water. It'll make our
march to the grave less painful.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.060
You've become a real ray
of sunshine, you know that?

01:18.061 --> 01:19.744
CABE: I still don't know how
this contraption's gonna work.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.847
WALTER: It's
simple science.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.316
The wind will cause this turbine
from the plane to spin,

01:24.318 --> 01:26.285
pushing air down into the hole
that you're digging.

01:26.287 --> 01:27.753
HAPPY:
We'll put in a reservoir

01:27.755 --> 01:30.122
made from fuselage plastics
that we melt and shape.

01:30.124 --> 01:31.423
As the air cools
underground,

01:31.425 --> 01:32.491
we get condensation.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.759
The reservoir fills up
with water

01:33.761 --> 01:36.862
that we then pump up through
the oxygen mask tubes.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.697
Uh, hey, man, don't look at me.
The only two people

01:38.699 --> 01:40.566
I understand on this island
are you and Paige.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.534
We're basically just making
water out of thin air.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.869
Oh, is that it?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.304
Okay, well,

01:45.306 --> 01:47.406
here's the first aid kit
that you wanted.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.108
And, you guys,

01:49.109 --> 01:50.809
I would love to help out with
the physical labor, but...

01:50.811 --> 01:52.344
Uh, uh-- you just rest.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.513
Ah, here we go.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.483
20 milliliter and 30 milliliter
plastic syringes,

01:57.485 --> 01:59.418
perfect for homemade hand pumps.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.970
And with the humidity
of the region,

02:00.971 --> 02:02.521
we should be able to get
up to 13 gallons per day.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.357
With you guys, I have no reason
not to believe it.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.509
Let's get this done.

02:07.510 --> 02:09.660
SYLVESTER:<i> Despite the</i>
<i> obstacles, there was optimism.</i>

02:11.532 --> 02:14.333
Cleaner than
L.A. tap water.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.734
Try it.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.140
(laughs softly)
It's amazing.

02:21.142 --> 02:24.176
You are... amazing.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.177
CABE:
Uh...

02:25.179 --> 02:26.311
Some of us dug, you know.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.579
And designed the pump.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.249
Well, I am sure you all
worked up an appetite.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.384
I've got fresh coconut meat
and catch of the day.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.352
TOBY: It's good
brain food.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.187
Omega-3s.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.190
Yeah, made with fresh
sea salt and coconut oil.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.425
I can't tell you how much
we all appreciate this.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.194
Well, I couldn't have done it
without the fishing rods
you made.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.428
Oh, well,
that's one of the benefits

02:43.430 --> 02:45.464
of growing up broke in Biloxi.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.466
Aw, thank you.
If you want fish,

02:47.468 --> 02:48.934
you got to make your own rod.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.537
Paige, may I have a squeeze
of lime in my water?

02:51.539 --> 02:54.239
Of course.

02:54.241 --> 02:56.842
My inevitable scurvy
thanks you.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.211
Be positive.
I am.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.913
Positive we're all gonna die.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.783
SYLVESTER:
<i> Despite my conviction,</i>

03:03.784 --> 03:05.651
<i> everyone tried</i>
<i> to contribute to the cause.</i>

03:05.653 --> 03:08.487
<i> Toby provided medical care.</i>

03:08.489 --> 03:10.455
Well, wound's fresh,
but it's healing nicely.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.491
Nurse, aloe?

03:12.493 --> 03:15.460
Keep putting this on,

03:15.462 --> 03:18.363
three times a day,
and no strenuous activity.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.932
Come on. I feel like
I got to earn my keep.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.200
You earned it

03:21.202 --> 03:22.234
when you landed a plane

03:22.236 --> 03:23.468
that was running
on a sports drink.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.406
(chuckles)
You know, it's just, uh...

03:27.408 --> 03:29.942
my baby must've been born
by now.

03:29.944 --> 03:32.411
Not being there
for him or her,

03:32.413 --> 03:34.413
like my father
wasn't there for me,

03:34.415 --> 03:37.883
is something I swore I'd never
let happen to my child.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.253
I just want to feel useful
to someone.

03:41.255 --> 03:43.522
It's not your fault.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.957
CABE:
Doc!

03:44.959 --> 03:47.492
Physics class is over.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.560
It's time for Ralph's

03:48.562 --> 03:49.561
botany lesson.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.796
TOBY:
Keep resting.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.698
Chin up, okay?
Got to go.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.334
SYLVESTER:<i> Though in vain,</i>
<i> I am proud of the efforts</i>

<i> Ralph's education</i>

03:59.506 --> 04:02.941
<i> Some tried to maintain</i>
<i> a sense of routine.</i>

04:05.479 --> 04:09.615
Smooth as a beauty queen's legs.
This aloe can do it all.

04:09.617 --> 04:10.782
I still don't get

04:10.784 --> 04:12.484
why you and Walt
insist on shaving.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.853
What, you got a big job
interview coming up?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.922
Eh, you can make fun.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.458
But the more
we cling to civilization,

04:19.460 --> 04:22.594
the more likely we are
to remain civilized.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.563
SYLVESTER:<i> Though remaining</i>
<i> civilized was the goal...</i>

04:24.565 --> 04:26.331

04:26.333 --> 04:29.401
<i> ...some still indulged</i>
<i> their animal instincts.</i>

04:33.607 --> 04:35.641
No privacy
on this damn island.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.609
Can't believe we're finally
getting a minute alone.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.511
A minute's all I need.

RALPH: Hey, guys,
what are you doing?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.449
CABE:
Sorry about that.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.618
We're just looking to grab
a couple coconuts.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.753
Me, too.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.391
(bird squawks)

04:54.528 --> 04:56.562
I hate it here.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.597
SYLVESTER:<i> Every effort was made</i>
<i> to get off this isle.</i>

04:58.599 --> 05:00.532
It doesn't look airworthy.

05:00.534 --> 05:04.436
Well, the plane's blankets
are a cheap polyester blend,

05:04.438 --> 05:06.071
big enough to cover
the bamboo frame,

05:06.073 --> 05:08.573
and light enough
to rise from the hot air.

05:08.575 --> 05:13.078
Now, I have taped a note inside
with our exact coordinates.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.783
It's a low probability,
but I believe it has a shot.

05:17.785 --> 05:20.052
Pass me that. Great.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.486
Yeah.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.498
Amazing.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.905
SYLVESTER:<i> Every mode</i>
<i>of transportation was explored.</i>

05:39.907 --> 05:41.540
Does not look seaworthy.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.742
Ah, that's just 'cause you're
a perfectionist engineer.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.944
We don't need to win a regatta,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.679
we just got to get out
over those breakers

05:47.681 --> 05:49.548
into the shipping lanes so we
can intercept passing vessels,

05:49.550 --> 05:50.849
and then we'll be spotted.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.785
(imitates pirate):
Argh, a fine vessel she'll be.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.841
Oh, crap.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.843
SYLVESTER:
<i> The repeated failures</i>

<i> on morale.</i>

06:27.121 --> 06:28.520
Hey.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.389
I ever tell you guys
about the time

06:30.391 --> 06:32.491
I flew in a hail storm

06:32.493 --> 06:36.395
off the coast of Maine,
no radar?

06:36.397 --> 06:37.980
Twice.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.564
Well, I guess I have
no more interesting stories

06:39.566 --> 06:40.832
to tell, then.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.868
Did I miss
the interesting ones?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.771
That was uncalled for.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.540
Sorry, Scotty,
I'm just tired and grumpy.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.842
And a little cold.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.712
Oh? Your man burnt
up your blankets.

06:53.714 --> 06:57.149
As opposed to them getting
waterlogged on your raft?

06:57.151 --> 06:58.617
At least my misstep
didn't result

06:58.619 --> 07:01.420
in important resources
burning up.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.188
Misstep? Is that a euphemism
for abject failure?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.657
Whatever. This is our snuggle
party and you're not invited.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.192
Speaking of snuggling,

07:07.194 --> 07:10.061
are we ever gonna
get some time alone?

07:10.063 --> 07:11.663
Sadly, I doubt it.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.168
Hey, this group togetherness
is great and all,

07:16.170 --> 07:17.803
but we're newlyweds.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.704
Two's company,
eight's a crowd.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.640
I know,
but what can we do?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.642
SYLVESTER:<i> And it was</i>
<i> the most basic human need</i>

No. I just really hope

07:33.987 --> 07:35.854

What the hell?

07:53.574 --> 07:54.773
Why are you wearing that?

07:54.775 --> 07:56.241
Time to deliver presents.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.543
My clothes are soaked
in saltwater.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.978
That was supposed to be
for our honeymoon.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.680
We are on our honeymoon.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.082
That was meant

08:39.853 --> 08:42.554
have to get down to the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current,

get swept up
into the Benguela,

08:44.291 --> 08:45.790
caught in
the South Equatorial stream,

08:45.792 --> 08:47.025
switch to the North stream,

08:47.027 --> 08:49.160
somehow find its way
to the Gulf Stream

08:49.162 --> 08:51.162

Florida fisherman found it

08:51.164 --> 08:52.497
and mailed it to her.

08:52.498 --> 08:53.831
And if I know
my Florida fishermen,

he'd probably just keep it.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.342
Well, leg down, your highness.
I can see the crown jewels.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.612
Oh. Look, my point is,

09:40.614 --> 09:42.747
as society regresses,
the populace reverts

09:42.749 --> 09:44.149
to the law of Neanderthals.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.184
That means that
Scotty or Cabe

09:46.186 --> 09:47.252
will soon try
to assert dominance.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.587
And with Scotty's injury

09:48.589 --> 09:49.922
and Cabe's advanced age,

09:49.923 --> 09:51.256
I do not know
how that's gonna play out.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.725
You don't say?

09:53.727 --> 09:54.893
I do say.

09:54.895 --> 09:58.096
You know,
I'm gonna go talk to Walter.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.266
That makes a lot of sense.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.802
Toby is making
absolutely no sense.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.971
He thinks Scotty and Cabe
are gonna battle it out

10:05.973 --> 10:07.739
for some type of supremacy
on the island.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.174
Sly is hiding
in a bunker,

10:09.176 --> 10:10.809
Happy is running around
like an elf.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.910
People are cracking,
Walter,

10:11.912 --> 10:13.211
and you need to
do something about it.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.113
What can I do?
Forget about everything

10:15.115 --> 10:17.148
I ever taught you,
about sensitivity, feelings.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.750
Let your EQ drop to zero

10:18.752 --> 10:20.652
and take charge,
piss everyone off.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.053
Call them stupid; whatever's
necessary to get everyone's

10:22.055 --> 10:23.321
head in the game
and working on legitimate ways

10:23.323 --> 10:25.173
to get off this island.

10:25.174 --> 10:27.024
Have you seen the size of those
damn jungle parrots?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.159
They are drawn
to Ralph,

10:28.161 --> 10:30.061
and I am not gonna let some...

10:30.063 --> 10:31.329
neon bird eat my son.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.400
That's it.
That's the solution.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.935
Parrots?

10:36.937 --> 10:38.870
No, being drawn to something,
like magnets.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.339
I can get us home.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.308
A giant magnet?
WALTER: Yes.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.711
If we build one big enough,
it can create a tiny disturbance

10:46.713 --> 10:47.846
in the Earth's
magnetic field,

10:47.848 --> 10:49.147
which is only
a millionth of a tesla.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.416
Now, a variation
in that magnetic field

10:51.418 --> 10:52.784
will be noticeable.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.286
By whom?

10:54.287 --> 10:55.787
There are 140 research stations
around the world

10:55.789 --> 10:57.989
that constantly monitor
the Earth's magnetic field:

10:57.991 --> 10:59.157
government agencies,

10:59.159 --> 11:00.692
universities.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.327
Now, a giant magnet can
create a tiny disturbance

11:02.329 --> 11:03.829
in the Earth's
magnetic field;

11:03.830 --> 11:05.330
it will be detected by
one of those stations

11:05.332 --> 11:08.033
and they will send
a research plane to investigate.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.167
How long will it take to build?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.702
CABE: If it's longer
than a few days,

11:10.704 --> 11:12.337
it'll take us
into monsoon season.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.373
Spent a lot of time in
the Pacific with the Corps.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.208
Some brutal storms
headed our way.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.627
TOBY:
When that happens,

11:18.628 --> 11:20.045
the fish are gonna
migrate to deeper waters

11:20.047 --> 11:21.663
and they will be
harder to catch.

11:21.664 --> 11:23.280
Not to mention, this island
is almost out of coconuts.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.016
WALTER: Which is why
it's now or never.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.785
We need to get to work
on that magnet immediately.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.920
No, that's why
we need to build a raft,

11:28.922 --> 11:30.789
get into the shipping lanes
and intercept passing vessels.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.190
Going onto the high seas

11:32.192 --> 11:34.759
with one of your crappy rafts
is suicide.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.394
Starving to death is suicide,

11:36.395 --> 11:38.028
and I am making good progress
with my raft.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.898
Not to mention, I have
the world's smartest engineer

11:39.900 --> 11:41.266
helping me build

11:41.268 --> 11:43.168
the "Guaranteed Success 5."

11:43.170 --> 11:45.036
No you won't; I'm with Walt.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.037
His plan could work.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.272
What kind of wife are you?

11:47.274 --> 11:48.373
The kind that wants to live.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.041
WALTER:
That's excellent.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.810
Now, Happy can help Cabe
locate the iron...

11:51.812 --> 11:54.245
Yeah, I'm, uh...

11:54.247 --> 11:55.880
I'm gonna go with Toby.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.817
He could use someone with
a nautical background.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.351
That's where I could be
of most help.
WALTER: Fine.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.419
Don't want your assistance.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.754
Happy and Paige
can work together.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.355
Not if I'm working
on the raft.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.424
What?
If you take the time
to build the magnet and fail,

12:06.426 --> 12:08.193
then we'll be stuck in
the middle of monsoon season.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.361
And then, getting on that
raft won't be an option.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.362
And then, we'll starve.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.732
Traitor.
Excuse me?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.734
Turncoat. Recreant.
(gasps)

12:15.736 --> 12:17.202
SCOTTY: Walt, listen,
with my injuries,

12:17.204 --> 12:20.171
I won't be too much help in
the open ocean, so, uh...

12:20.173 --> 12:22.807
I'll help you with
the magnet, okay?

12:22.809 --> 12:24.809
Sorry, Toby.
Big deal, barely know you.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.445
Okay, so I suggest that
we move to higher ground

12:27.447 --> 12:29.347
where we'll
build our device.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.982
The cave over the ridge
should make a good home.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.417
Let's go, yeah?

12:39.326 --> 12:42.761
A few weeks into marriage
and we're already separating.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.063
Thank you, Walter.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.364
SYLVESTER:<i> And so,</i>
<i> Scorpion is a team divided.</i>

12:47.367 --> 12:49.801
The stress is palpable.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.837
The only way I've been able
to remotely keep my sanity

12:52.839 --> 12:55.240
is by writing in this journ...

12:59.279 --> 13:01.346
Son of a...

13:13.994 --> 13:15.960
Home sweet home.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.196
I guess we should set up shop.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.799
Later. I want us focused on
nothing but the magnet for now.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.133
Okay, so, we will need

13:22.135 --> 13:24.803
iron, copper wire
and electricity.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.355
Iron should not
be difficult.

13:26.356 --> 13:27.906
The island is volcanic, so
it has an iron magma core.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.858
Those big rock spires
on the north side

13:29.859 --> 13:31.809
of the jungle are cooled magma,
pure iron.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.511
Smart. So we will need
to wrap the copper wire

13:33.513 --> 13:35.030
around one of those spires.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.548
SCOTTY: Okay, where are we
gonna get copper wire from

13:36.550 --> 13:38.216
in the middle
of nowhere?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.984
Plane's wiring is aluminum.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.553
Already have a solution for
that: the maps in the bunker

13:41.555 --> 13:43.572
have markings
for a munitions dump.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.590
And precision-guided
World War II munitions

13:45.592 --> 13:47.458
used copper wires to
transfer guidance signals.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.394
So, when the
war was over,

13:49.396 --> 13:50.495
surplus munitions were buried;

13:50.497 --> 13:52.897
more often than not,
in shallow pits.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.332
Even if we know where they are,

13:54.334 --> 13:56.467
we're talking about unspent,
live ammunition here.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.036
You want safe,

13:58.038 --> 13:59.504
there's raft-building
on the beach.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.272
We're all about getting home.
Let's go. Come.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.374
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.043
TOBY: First she doesn't
tell me about the single

14:05.045 --> 14:06.878
she recorded in
Portugal, and then,

14:06.880 --> 14:08.479
she teams up with
Walter over me?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.381
This is a bad start
to a marriage.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.853
I guess, at least she
didn't call me a traitor.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.856
A-Actually, I caused that.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.524
I told him to just be
a brutal brainiac

14:19.526 --> 14:20.959
to increase
our chances of rescue.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.595
Like, take no prisoners
kind of thing.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.564
He sure
took to it quickly.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.532
Yeah, well, Walter rarely
does things half-ass.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.634
CABE:
Toby's been launching the rafts

14:29.636 --> 14:31.319
near the rocks up ahead,

14:31.320 --> 14:33.003
says it gives him protection
from the surf.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.940
The rafts need protection
from his crappy designs.

14:40.881 --> 14:41.913
What the...?

14:44.885 --> 14:47.552
PAIGE:
What's that?

14:47.554 --> 14:50.421
These are the letters
I sent to Allie.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.589
All of them.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.426
I knew they wouldn't
get to her.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.561
TOBY:
Cabe, you know what?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.596
I'm gonna help dig them up,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.665
and then we'll throw them
back out there for you again.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.133
Never give up hope,
right, buddy?

15:02.135 --> 15:03.601
(bottle clinks)

15:05.005 --> 15:06.471
Hang on. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's this?

15:06.473 --> 15:10.174
It's that Portuguese crap
that Happy polished off.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.943
TOBY: No, underneath it,
this metal ridge here.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.177
This is an oil drum.

15:13.179 --> 15:14.979
Help me dig it up!

15:14.981 --> 15:17.148
PAIGE:
How did an oil drum get here?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.917
RALPH:
Here's another one.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.019
Ooh. There's another
ridge sticking out.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.959
(Cabe groaning)

15:33.333 --> 15:35.700
A wave must've knocked it
off the tanker.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.670
And the current
washed them ashore.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.138
Well,

15:40.140 --> 15:42.073
there's a couple of holes
that we can patch up

15:42.075 --> 15:43.308
with tree sap
and plane scraps,

15:43.310 --> 15:44.676
but these suckers are buoyant.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.328
They can get over the breakers.

15:46.329 --> 15:47.979
We just got to strap them
to our new raft:

15:47.981 --> 15:50.415
the "My Idea Is Better
Than Walter's 1."

15:51.718 --> 15:53.952
(Scotty groaning loudly)

15:53.954 --> 15:56.321
So explain how this
is gonna work.

15:56.323 --> 15:57.622
Rock rolls
into the basin,

15:57.624 --> 15:59.624
creates concussive shockwaves,

15:59.626 --> 16:02.160
identifies
the munitions.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.528
And how is it
gonna do that?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.596
Whoa!
WALTER: Oh.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.071
Like that.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.606
Now all we have to do is
dig up the munitions casings

16:15.608 --> 16:17.308
and take out the copper wiring.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.677
Well, there's live
munitions down there.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.979
How do you expect to do this?

16:20.981 --> 16:22.113
With caution.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.083
(groans)
Man, this is hard.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.718
CABE: Anything
worthwhile is hard.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.753
No, I mean tearing up
Happy's Cleopatra costume.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.755
This was supposed to be
for our, um, uh...

16:33.727 --> 16:35.159
(quietly):
frisky business.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.731
I have a 200 IQ; do you really
think I don't understand

16:39.733 --> 16:41.132
what you guys are talking about?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.767
Look, you might know
what I'm talking about,

16:42.769 --> 16:44.769
but you're not gonna
understand till you're 18.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.537
How about we just stay focused
on getting this thing

16:46.539 --> 16:48.339
shipshape for now?
TOBY: You're right.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.209
Once this is on its
maiden voyage, we can find help,

16:51.211 --> 16:52.510
and then I can spend
the rest of my life

16:52.512 --> 16:54.312
rubbing O'Brien's
smug nose it in.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.514
All right! Done!

16:56.516 --> 16:58.649
Last drum's tied on, now
we just got to get that radio.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.486
WALTER: Toby is gonna be
quite annoyed

17:01.488 --> 17:03.521
when our plan succeeds over his.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.757
Sure, 'cause that's what's
important right now.
It is important.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.792
We're in a situation where
Scorpion should stick together

17:07.794 --> 17:10.395
and he drove us apart
with his stupid raft.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.563
His plan is all wet,

17:12.565 --> 17:14.432
literally and figuratively.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.068
SCOTTY: And you're the
smartest one of the group?

17:17.070 --> 17:18.369
Oh, yeah, we're done.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.370
That's enough.
Okay?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.772
Yeah. Happy,
cut the wire.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.143
Now, all we need is the radio.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.813
Uh, Captain Kangaroo,
the Charleston, Ziggy--

17:28.815 --> 17:30.748
these are all things
that Walter doesn't know,

17:30.750 --> 17:32.617
yet he's the
genius of geniuses.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.285
I don't think so.
WALTER: Oh.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.054
Look who it is.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.424
How'd your raft project
turn out?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.060
All wet?

17:42.062 --> 17:45.696
It didn't work with us,
why are you using it on them?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.382
TOBY: That's
really clever.

17:47.383 --> 17:49.067
You three finding
that the, uh. magnet idea

17:49.069 --> 17:50.802
isn't as attractive as
you thought it might be?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.805
'Cause magnets are
supposed to attract?

17:53.807 --> 17:55.373
I think they... they got it.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.341
It just wasn't funny.
You're on my team.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.077
I sincerely hope
you haven't come here

17:59.079 --> 18:00.211
for the radio.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.779
Walt, we need it
to monitor the storms

18:01.781 --> 18:03.431
and locations of other ships.

18:03.432 --> 18:05.082
You'll sink it.
Besides, we need it

18:05.085 --> 18:06.384
for its crank
and some of its components

18:06.386 --> 18:07.585
to create a charge
on the magnet.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.353
No, no, you're gonna destroy it.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.089
Hey, uh, where's the kid?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.091
Oh, he took a break to go
pump some water.

18:13.093 --> 18:15.093
Said he was tired
of all the negativity.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.761
SCOTTY:
Huh. Smart boy.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.830
SYLVESTER : I, too, have
grown weary of the acrimony

18:18.832 --> 18:23.434
that plagues what will
surely be our last weeks.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.336
Oh, great,
Hagrid wants to chime in.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.671
We've just come here
for the radio, Sly.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.872
No, we came here

18:27.874 --> 18:29.173
for the radio, Sly.
(Sylvester snaps)

18:29.175 --> 18:30.441
Neither of you may have it.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.110
You're fighting
is ruining

18:32.112 --> 18:34.278
what should be a sweet embrace

18:34.280 --> 18:36.614
of our journey
to the next plane.
CABE: That's it.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.851
What if I blow right by you
and take it?

18:39.853 --> 18:41.619
Go ahead.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.855
I foresaw your arrival.

18:43.857 --> 18:46.124
The radio is well-hidden.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.191
It appears

18:47.193 --> 18:50.495
Hagrid holds all the cards.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.436
Though I believe
your effort is fruitless,

18:58.438 --> 19:01.739
I have no right to
interfere with your desire

19:01.741 --> 19:03.441
to leave the island.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.142
Okay, good, then just
give us the radio.
PAIGE: And fast,

19:05.145 --> 19:06.511
this place clearly hasn't
been aired out in weeks.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.179
It's not up to me.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.281
So who do we ask, the lizard?
SYLVESTER: Don't be ridiculous.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.816
Mitchell's just an advisor.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.219
SCOTTY:
Oh, man,

19:15.221 --> 19:16.888
we are so far gone.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.923
For me to decide,

19:18.925 --> 19:20.925
you both need to
make your cases.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.460
Dr. Curtis.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.163
You've heard of Kon-Tiki?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.764
Behold...

19:26.766 --> 19:28.166
"Kon-Take Me Home

19:28.168 --> 19:29.667
to Los Angeles."

19:29.669 --> 19:31.669
Previously known as the SS

19:31.671 --> 19:33.437
"My Idea Is Better
Than Walter's."

19:33.439 --> 19:35.940
And this is
lightweight, sturdy.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.342
This oil drum raft

19:37.343 --> 19:38.743
has the seaworthiness
of a naval destroyer,

19:38.745 --> 19:41.913
but... with-with
none of the comforts.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.447
But this sucker is solid, Sly.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.849
WALTER: Oh, based on
the engineering

19:44.851 --> 19:46.751
of a behaviorist?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.219
Might as well
build it underwater,

19:48.221 --> 19:49.587
'cause that's where it's headed.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.955
SYLVESTER:
But it isn't

19:50.957 --> 19:54.358
the design of a behaviorist,
now is it, Toby?

19:54.360 --> 19:55.526
Huh? What are you
blabbing about?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.395
You.

19:57.396 --> 19:59.263
Turning my bunker
into a house of lies.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.265
I did the hydrodynamics
by memory,

20:01.267 --> 20:02.767
but it should be seaworthy.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.735
Oh, thank you, my cupcake.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.604
I'm gonna have us home
in no time.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.206
Then, we can start off

20:08.208 --> 20:10.975
this honeymoon the... right way,

20:10.977 --> 20:12.510
if you catch my drift.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.911
Clear as day.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.248
I mean physically, hmm?
Daddy's wound up.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.516
It was obvious the first time

20:18.518 --> 20:20.384
and I want to kick
this marriage off, too,

20:20.386 --> 20:24.322
but if you call yourself Daddy
again, we don't consummate ever.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.357
(kisses)

20:35.969 --> 20:37.468
Et tu?

20:37.470 --> 20:39.237
I just want
to get off this rock.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.339
A second option would increase
the odds of success.

20:41.341 --> 20:44.242
And Toby can't build a
decent raft without help.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.477
SYLVESTER:
Walter.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.312
Your plan, please.

20:48.314 --> 20:51.515
The spire at the top
of the island's mountain

20:51.517 --> 20:52.984
has an iron core.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.352
I've salvaged
copper wire.

20:54.354 --> 20:57.321
All we need to create
a magnetic thump

20:57.323 --> 20:58.473
is electricity.

20:58.474 --> 20:59.624
So, if you'd just
hand over the radio,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.943
Happy can dismantle it

21:01.944 --> 21:04.261
for the generator
to power the electromagnet.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.265
Hmm. Sounds like a plan.

21:07.267 --> 21:12.336
But, how exactly did you get the
rope to ascend the iron spire?

21:12.338 --> 21:16.941
It was woven from the curtain
cords from the plane's wreckage.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.346
You wove it?

21:22.348 --> 21:25.283
Or someone else?

21:29.555 --> 21:32.423
Excellent. Tensile strength
of sailing hemp.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.025
Well done, my little...
Not now.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.761
I want out of here by
any means necessary.
Understood.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.362
Walter, something else
that needs attention.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.298
What we started back
in Kovelsky's storage closet?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.701
I really want to finish that.

21:43.703 --> 21:46.804
Mama's a little... pent up.

21:57.583 --> 22:00.851
These people
have lost their minds.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.453
You were spying on us.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.622
TOBY: Paige, we are
nothing without loyalty!

22:04.624 --> 22:06.324
Can it, shrink. I don't care
about this dumb contest.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.725
I just want us all
to survive.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.328
Well, we certainly won't if
we're on the "SS Sharkfood."

22:10.330 --> 22:11.713
You want
a magnetic thump?

22:11.714 --> 22:13.097
I can give you one
you won't forget, okay?

22:13.099 --> 22:14.465
Hey, you guys, you guys.
You know what, Sylvester,

22:14.467 --> 22:15.766
just make your decision.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.071
I got it.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.357
Given the pitch
of the iron spire,

22:22.358 --> 22:24.642
there is no way Walter
could scale it with the wire

22:24.644 --> 22:26.043
and the radio.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.412
His plan, though
theoretically sound,

22:28.414 --> 22:29.647
would flop.

22:29.648 --> 22:30.881
Ah! We sail
with the tide!

22:30.883 --> 22:32.616
SYLVESTER: Yes,
if you like the idea

22:32.618 --> 22:34.719
of drowning in two days.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.821
You could make it to
the shipping lane,

22:36.823 --> 22:40.124
but once the monsoons hit,
your boat is toast.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.425
(laughs)

22:41.427 --> 22:44.462
Because you both
insisted on working

22:44.464 --> 22:46.964
separately,
you've developed plans

22:46.966 --> 22:49.567
that are guaranteed to fail.

22:49.569 --> 22:52.370
So, until you can agree
to cooperate...

22:54.107 --> 22:56.107
...no one gets the radio.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.742
Cabe, grab him.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.477
With pleasure.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.512
TOBY:
Give us the damn radio!

23:01.514 --> 23:04.014
Mutiny! Mutiny!

23:04.016 --> 23:05.483
WALTER:
Hey! Hey!

23:05.485 --> 23:07.451
The radio or I eat Mitchell.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.686
No!

23:08.688 --> 23:10.121
He is an excellent
source of protein

23:10.123 --> 23:11.756
and I am starting to
lose muscle mass,

23:11.758 --> 23:14.558
so three, two, one...

23:14.560 --> 23:15.693
Fine, fine.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.428
I hid it in the
base of a tree.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.696
I'll take you to it.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.435
Oh. Look at his eyes.
He's terrified.

23:24.437 --> 23:27.905
Boy, you dumped that
EQ like a hot rock.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.740
I like it.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.542
(moans)

23:31.544 --> 23:33.611
Guys.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.513
We got a problem here.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.150
Where's the crank?

23:39.152 --> 23:41.185
The radio's useless without it.
What are you trying to pull?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.521
I swear, this is where I hid it.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.555
Thief!

23:44.557 --> 23:45.556
Absconder!

23:45.558 --> 23:47.558
Ralph!

23:47.560 --> 23:48.993
What about him?

23:48.995 --> 23:50.661
He didn't leave
to go pump water.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.929
Yesterday,
he helped me search

23:51.931 --> 23:53.063
for good hiding places.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.532
This was one of them.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.933
But why would he take it?

23:55.935 --> 23:57.535
I don't know, but if he
accidentally compromises

23:57.537 --> 23:58.969
that generator,
there is no magnetic signal.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.105
Or communication with the raft.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.606
Enough. Everyone split up
and find him.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.808
Let's go.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.842
Ralph!
PAIGE:
Ralph!

24:04.844 --> 24:06.510
Ralph! Ralph!

24:09.515 --> 24:11.215
Ralph?
Ralph?

24:11.217 --> 24:13.851
Ralph! Yeah,
he's not here.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.756
Copper wire's missing.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.558
Oh, no. Oh, no.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.026
Ralph must've taken it
to the spire.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.778
He's trying to reenact my plan.

24:23.779 --> 24:25.529
Yeah, but if the peak to
the spire is too steep for you,

24:25.531 --> 24:26.997
Ralph would know there's no way
he could climb it.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.066
If that is true,
he's not going to the spire.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.201
He's going to the beach.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.235
Let's go, let's go!

24:31.237 --> 24:32.570
Walter.

24:32.572 --> 24:34.205
Walt?

24:34.207 --> 24:35.539
Walter, what's happening?

24:35.541 --> 24:37.041
Ralph is going after
Toby's oil drums.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.109
Now, the steel drums contain
chromium, which is magnetic.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.978
Ralph's gonna use them
in place of the spire.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.813
Seems like an easier way
to put your plan in action.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.648
Why isn't it a good thing?
It will create a magnetic pulse,

24:44.650 --> 24:46.183
but since the chromium levels
in the drums are low,

24:46.185 --> 24:47.618
Ralph will have
to compensate

24:47.619 --> 24:49.052
by building
a much larger charge,

24:49.055 --> 24:51.121
which could cause
the electromagnet to explode.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.591
Oh, God.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.659
(electricity crackling)

25:01.767 --> 25:03.167
HAPPY:
Oh, man.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.269
I know what he's doing and
I think it could explode.

25:05.271 --> 25:06.837
Stop, kid!

25:13.846 --> 25:15.513
Kid, you okay?

25:15.515 --> 25:17.014
Uh-huh.
(shouts)

25:17.016 --> 25:19.049
(Ralph screams)
Ralph!

25:25.224 --> 25:26.891
PAIGE:
Ralph! Ralph!

25:26.893 --> 25:29.093
Come on!
Hurry, we have to dig!

25:29.095 --> 25:30.227
Everybody, get digging!

25:30.229 --> 25:31.662
Uh, not everyone,
just Cabe and Paige.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.663
The rest of us sweep up

25:32.665 --> 25:34.231
what they excavate.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.833
We need help.
Too much weight in the sand

25:35.835 --> 25:37.067
and it will cave in further.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.702
So, Sly, get behind me.
You two, stay there.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.939
I'm coming, Ralph.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.644
PAIGE:
Oh, come on.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.979
Where are they?!
HAPPY:
Paige isn't the strongest.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.748
You or Sly should be digging.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.616
Right now she could lift
a Mack Truck off that kid.

25:52.618 --> 25:53.951
I'm sure as hell
not gonna tell her to stop.

25:53.953 --> 25:54.785
Come on, Cabe.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.091
I see his hand!
He's moving.

26:01.093 --> 26:03.594
Okay, everyone, get
ready to pull Paige.

26:03.596 --> 26:04.695
Come on. Come on!

26:04.697 --> 26:06.997
Come on!
Okay.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.265
Paige, dig around
Ralph's shoulders.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.000
Yell when your hands are
underneath his arms!

26:10.002 --> 26:12.970
Okay. Almost there.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.004
I'm coming, Ralph!

26:14.006 --> 26:16.807
(grunts)
Got him.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.342
Ready?
Okay, pull now.

26:18.344 --> 26:22.179
One, two, three.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.881
(Walter shouting)

26:25.718 --> 26:27.351
WALTER:
He's breathing.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.720
HAPPY:
We got to get Scotty.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.990
TOBY:
Sly, let's go.

26:34.126 --> 26:36.727
Oh. Are you okay?
Sweetheart.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.796
CABE:
I got him!

26:43.769 --> 26:45.002
(grunts)
(sand sliding)

26:45.003 --> 26:46.236
Every time Cabe removes sand,
more falls in.

26:46.238 --> 26:47.905
I can't keep it off him!

26:47.907 --> 26:50.841
Oh, God.
(grunting)

26:52.111 --> 26:53.811
You had a water bucket
on the raft?

26:53.813 --> 26:55.012
Over there!

27:01.654 --> 27:02.786
Getting nowhere fast!

27:02.788 --> 27:03.854
Walt, bucket!

27:03.856 --> 27:05.022
Here.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.959
No matter what I do,
it keeps coming down on him.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.828
Cabe, dig as hard as you
can for three seconds

27:10.830 --> 27:12.162
and then get out of the way.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.866
CABE:
Three, two, one!

27:18.771 --> 27:19.837
You all right?

27:21.107 --> 27:22.740
You all right in there?

27:22.742 --> 27:25.709
SCOTTY:
Yeah. I can breathe,

27:25.711 --> 27:28.112
but the sand
is crushing my chest!

27:28.114 --> 27:29.713
Bucket will give us enough time

27:29.715 --> 27:31.215
to excavate around him,
so the sand

27:31.217 --> 27:33.651
won't cover his mouth and nose,
but we got to hurry!

27:33.653 --> 27:34.752
CABE:
All right.

27:39.325 --> 27:40.691
Wait a minute.

27:42.762 --> 27:43.927
I got under his arms!

27:44.897 --> 27:45.929
I've got him!

27:50.836 --> 27:54.338
(Scotty groaning)

28:04.850 --> 28:06.750
(Scotty coughs)

28:06.752 --> 28:08.285
(coughs)

28:08.287 --> 28:10.454
That was a lot of force
on your chest, Scotty.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.822
Are you okay?

28:11.824 --> 28:13.757
Uh, yeah.

28:15.728 --> 28:18.328
Thank you.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.031
(groans)

28:23.803 --> 28:24.802
Hey.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.772
I know you're upset
because you feel

28:28.774 --> 28:30.074
you aren't there for your child,

28:30.076 --> 28:32.409
but you were there
for mine today.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.911
Thank you.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.846
Yeah.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.915
What were you
thinking, Ralph?

28:39.719 --> 28:41.785
You were all
like fighting children.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.192
Neither of the plans was
gonna work independently.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.494
I had to do what I could
to save Scorpion.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.497
We were dopes.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.833
We were.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.369
Well, do we know if it worked?
Did the magnetic pulse go off?

28:59.371 --> 29:01.305
Walter, check your watch.
Oh.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.873
Wait, it stopped.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.842
That means the magnetic
pulse froze its movement.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.410
The plane could be here anytime.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.078
Or never.
Sly.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.913
You're right,
I'm done with the negativity.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.148
Great, so we have
the fire and "SOS" dug

29:11.150 --> 29:12.316
in the sand.

29:12.318 --> 29:13.317
Any other ideas how we can

29:13.319 --> 29:14.451
get a signal to the plane?

29:16.789 --> 29:18.856
Anyone?
Penny for your thoughts.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.894
Pennies?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.880
Wait, wait, wait, that's it.

29:25.881 --> 29:27.865
The Scottish wedding pennies
that Cabe gave Toby and Happy.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.833
Another gift
we didn't register for.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.235
WALTER: Right,
so, if we combine

29:31.237 --> 29:33.003
zinc oxide from
the rusted munitions

29:33.005 --> 29:34.371
with the copper shavings
from the pennies

29:34.373 --> 29:35.806
and then we light it on fire,

29:35.808 --> 29:37.625
it will burn very brightly.

29:37.626 --> 29:39.443
I have a steel file in
my tool bag to get the rust off.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.012
Everyone else can shave the
pennies using volcanic rocks.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.313
We'll combine
the zinc oxide and copper

29:43.315 --> 29:45.382
into the SOS until it
burns like a neon sign.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.951
Guys, about how long do you
estimate it will take us

29:47.953 --> 29:49.486
to shave down a hundred pennies?

29:49.488 --> 29:51.221
With all of us working,
at least an hour.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.390
But we don't have an hour.
Listen.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.958
(plane engine buzzing)

29:54.960 --> 29:56.393
A plane!

29:56.395 --> 29:58.395
How did a plane
get here so fast?

29:58.397 --> 30:00.397
Well, whatever research station
that picked up

30:00.399 --> 30:02.099
on the magnetic disturbance

30:02.101 --> 30:04.301
must have diverted
a monsoon-tracking plane

30:04.303 --> 30:05.369
that was already in the area.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.370
Shh.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.437
(plane engine buzzing)

30:07.439 --> 30:08.438
That engine's a small prop

30:08.440 --> 30:09.473
flying at a high altitude.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.507
SYLVESTER: Well, it's not
looking for people.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.142
It's here to collect data.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.510
Our only hope is to signal it.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.313
There's no way we can shave
a hundred pennies by hand

30:16.315 --> 30:18.115
into dust before
that plane gets here.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.683
It's getting louder.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.250
Well, we could've pulverized
those pennies if one of you

30:21.253 --> 30:22.886
knuckleheads got us the one
present I really wanted

30:22.888 --> 30:25.255
on that registry, the one
thing I hinted at 14 times!

30:25.257 --> 30:26.390
The six-speed industrial juicer?

30:26.392 --> 30:27.914
With titanium blades.

30:27.915 --> 30:29.437
I've been hiding it.
Okay, get it.

30:29.438 --> 30:30.960
Cabe and I will grab munitions
scrap for the zinc oxide.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.162
HAPPY:
And batteries.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.497
(plane engine buzzing)

30:33.498 --> 30:34.831
Uh, everyone strip their
cell phones and laptops.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.166
I need to goose that juicer.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.501
Let's go.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.474
Hurry, we need another battery.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.010
Okay, here you go.
(groans)

30:53.319 --> 30:54.384
Okay.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.488
Congratulations.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.358
I got the coins and
Happy's file! Ooh.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.492
That also makes soup.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.194
The plane is
nearly above us.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.462
So we have what, seconds?

31:05.464 --> 31:08.131
The plane will make three loops
over the island

31:08.133 --> 31:09.499
to get magnetic readings.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.336
If we can't get
the signal up before that...

31:12.338 --> 31:13.537
we're dust.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.217
WALTER: Got the rest
of the ammo shells!

31:27.219 --> 31:29.152
We're gonna need Happy's file.
Yeah, coming at you.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.190
It's working.
Uh, it's got power,

31:33.192 --> 31:34.224
but no clue if it can
chew pennies.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.425
Okay, guys, this is
gonna sound like

31:35.427 --> 31:38.262
a T. rex eating a car,
so plug your ears.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.364
(pennies grinding)

31:45.070 --> 31:46.670
(pennies grinding)

31:49.541 --> 31:51.308
(loud grinding)

31:56.181 --> 31:57.581
We got copper flakes!

31:57.583 --> 32:00.350
The plane is making
its second turn!

32:08.560 --> 32:10.294
I hate to
break it to you,

32:10.296 --> 32:11.962
but we're not gonna
have enough time

32:11.964 --> 32:13.297
to fill all three
of these letters.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.965
Just fill in the "S"!

32:14.967 --> 32:16.667
Hopefully this pilot
is smart enough to know

32:16.669 --> 32:18.969
that a flaming "S"
isn't a natural phenomenon.

32:18.971 --> 32:20.604
(grinding continues)

32:20.606 --> 32:21.605
The thing's gonna blow.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.241
Just a little more.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.209
Ugh! That'll have to do.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.244
(grinding stops)

32:27.246 --> 32:28.946
The plane's making
its third loop!

32:28.948 --> 32:30.213
Happy, hurry!

32:42.227 --> 32:43.026
Done!

32:53.405 --> 32:55.706
TOBY:
Hey, it's "S"...

32:55.708 --> 32:57.574
for Scorpion.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.142
Our team.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.278
A team that never
should be divided,

33:01.280 --> 33:02.579
no matter how bad things get.

33:02.581 --> 33:03.747
Agreed.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.215
Double agreed.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.317
(plane engine buzzing)

33:20.733 --> 33:23.500
(plane engine receding)

33:26.138 --> 33:27.537
(sighs) He didn't see us.

33:30.009 --> 33:32.309
Well, I'm thinking of a word
that starts with an "S."

33:32.311 --> 33:34.611
Yeah, and I bet
that word isn't "saved."

33:34.613 --> 33:36.413
(sighs) It is not.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.353
Well, I have something to say.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.356
Even though this
didn't work out,

33:46.358 --> 33:48.425
I am so proud
of all of us.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.727
We came together to save
Ralph and-and Scotty,

33:50.729 --> 33:54.631
and to make this signal
with virtually no time.

33:54.633 --> 33:58.168
And that is what Scorpion
is all about.

33:58.170 --> 34:01.438
So, no matter how long
we have to stay here,

34:01.440 --> 34:03.273
as long as we are family,

34:03.275 --> 34:04.741
we are gonna be okay.
(claps hands)

34:11.083 --> 34:12.049
(plane engine buzzing)

34:12.051 --> 34:14.418
The plane's coming back!

34:14.420 --> 34:16.353
(all cheering)

34:16.355 --> 34:19.122
Oh, thank God, I couldn't stand
another minute in this hellhole.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.357
(all cheering)

34:20.359 --> 34:22.125
CABE:
Hey!

34:22.127 --> 34:23.593
He tipped his wing at us,
he saw us!

34:29.201 --> 34:31.601
(laughs)
CABE: Yeah!

34:31.603 --> 34:34.571
(all cheering)

34:34.573 --> 34:36.206
(whoops)

34:36.208 --> 34:40.510
(all cheering, laughing)

34:40.512 --> 34:43.513
SYLVESTER:<i> Let this be</i>

34:52.224 --> 34:53.590
I don't care how many people
want to interview us.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.759
We just got back
a few hours ago.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.462
We're exhausted; we don't want
to be paraded around on TV.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.530
That's our position.

35:00.532 --> 35:01.665
(phone beeps)
Vultures.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.466
TOBY:
Walt,

35:02.468 --> 35:03.567
Cabe, Sly,

35:03.569 --> 35:05.268
you guys got to check this out.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.405
Happy's past is about
to come back to haunt her.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.290
SYLVESTER:
This is what you spent

35:10.291 --> 35:12.174
your first two hours back
in civilization doing?

35:12.177 --> 35:14.344
Yeah, I've been obsessed
since she told me about it.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.746
And I, Sherlock Holmes,
discovered that

35:16.748 --> 35:19.549
her name in Portugal
was not Happy,

35:19.551 --> 35:21.618
it was "Feliz."

35:21.620 --> 35:23.320
So, "Happy"
in Portuguese.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.105
Must have taken hours.

35:25.106 --> 35:26.889
I haven't watched it yet,
so if it gets racy,

35:26.892 --> 35:29.159
shield your eyes.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.862

CABE:
Um...

35:59.191 --> 36:00.891
catchy.

36:00.893 --> 36:03.527
SYLVESTER: I don't know
any Portuguese,

36:03.529 --> 36:05.595
but I do know some Spanish,

36:05.597 --> 36:07.731
and that sounded like

36:07.733 --> 36:10.600
"you're my friendly,
friendly friend"?

36:10.602 --> 36:12.469
"I like you until the end."

36:12.471 --> 36:14.371
And then it repeats itself,
like, 400 times.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.240
I found a mathematical formula
for their dance tracks.

36:17.242 --> 36:18.441
It's syncopated nonsense
with a quarter-beat

36:18.443 --> 36:20.544
back-track and auto-tune.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.246
Then I wrote repetitive,
mindless lyrics,

36:22.247 --> 36:23.947
and a few weeks later,
I had royalties coming in.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.649
I was hard up on cash.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.351
So, now you know.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.554
As we have discussed,

36:30.556 --> 36:32.622
I have a past.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.258
I know. I accept it.

36:35.260 --> 36:39.696
Um, I only have, um...

36:39.698 --> 36:41.765
one question. Um...

36:49.474 --> 36:51.341
Do I still have
the flamingo dress?

36:54.680 --> 36:56.346
(whispers):
Back of my closet.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.583
(claps hands)
Uh, we're gone.

36:59.585 --> 37:00.951
Uh, two weeks, off
the grid. Don't call.

37:00.953 --> 37:02.919
Don't write.
Love you. Bye.

37:05.657 --> 37:06.590
HAPPY: Bye, Paige.
Bye, Ralph.

37:06.592 --> 37:07.591
PAIGE:
Wait.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.693
Where are they going?

37:09.695 --> 37:10.827
To be friendly,
friendly friends.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.963
But I got everyone's
favorite meals.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.764
Kovelsky's brisket
for Toby.
(phone rings)

37:14.766 --> 37:16.116
And steak for Cabe.

37:16.117 --> 37:17.467
Fermented fish for Walter,
which I can't believe

37:17.469 --> 37:18.735
you actually asked for fish.
(phone rings)

37:18.737 --> 37:21.504
Uh, I will dig in in a moment.
Hello?

37:21.506 --> 37:23.340
Ralph, you ready to go?

37:23.342 --> 37:25.408
Where you guys off to?
I got a notice.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.744
The mayor of West Altadenia
had me declared legally dead,

37:27.746 --> 37:30.814
so we're going to City Hall
to bring me back to life.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.350
The paperwork requires
the brainpower

37:33.352 --> 37:36.386
of two geniuses
working all night.

37:36.388 --> 37:39.556
By the way, I kept
something for you.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.809
My note to Allie.

37:42.810 --> 37:44.660
I thought you'd want
to give it to her in person,

37:44.663 --> 37:46.997
rather than wave-mail.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.433
Sorry for being
such a jerk about that.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.369
We were all under
a lot of stress.

37:52.371 --> 37:55.805
You know, I'm actually
nervous about seeing her.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.607
She's gonna be landing
in three hours.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.376
The lady booked a flight home
from her sister's

37:59.378 --> 38:01.378
the second she found out
you were still alive.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.612
You have nothing
to be scared of.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.680
Oh, my God!

38:03.682 --> 38:06.916
Ah!
What the hell?

38:06.918 --> 38:08.652
Oh... (laughs)

38:08.654 --> 38:10.320
It was just a...
a dust bunny.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.554
I thought it was a spider.

38:11.556 --> 38:13.890
(chuckles)

38:13.892 --> 38:16.626
It's good to have
the old Sly back.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.028
(chuckles)
Ralph, we're out of here.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.362
I'll give you a lift.

38:19.364 --> 38:21.631
Bye, Mom.
See you tomorrow. Hey...

38:22.567 --> 38:24.567
Thanks for watching him.

38:24.569 --> 38:26.069
(chuckles)

38:26.071 --> 38:27.570
That is wonderful news.

38:27.572 --> 38:30.607
Yeah, congratulations.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.575
Yes, please,
send a photo. Bye.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.779
That was Scotty.
He and his family are great.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.647
He was actually holding
his daughter while we talked.

38:37.649 --> 38:41.318
That's nice.
All's well that ends well.

38:44.423 --> 38:47.757
So, we are alone.

38:47.759 --> 38:48.758
I'm concerned.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.427
Okay.

38:50.429 --> 38:51.661
On the island,
you told me

38:51.663 --> 38:52.896
it didn't matter
if my EQ dropped,

38:52.898 --> 38:54.831
so long as I was able
to figure out a way

38:54.833 --> 38:56.499
for us to survive
and it helped.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.502
But I am worried
that it might have

38:59.504 --> 39:01.037
dropped and stayed there.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.606
I mean, I...

39:03.608 --> 39:06.710
I threatened to eat
Sylvester's friend.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.778
You've had a lot of fits
and starts with EQ,

39:08.780 --> 39:12.916
but you've always seemed
to be on a forward path.

39:16.655 --> 39:18.722
You know, my overwhelming
emotion right now is that I...

39:18.724 --> 39:20.757
I feel...

39:25.397 --> 39:28.431
Well, a little sick
to my stomach.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.404
Mmm, do you have a bottle
of wine upstairs?

39:34.406 --> 39:36.806
Uh, someone gave it to us
after a-a job.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.075
I have no idea if it's
really any good or not.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.710
Uh, I-I don't even know
what that means.

39:40.712 --> 39:42.078
Seems kind of subjective,
doesn't it?

39:42.080 --> 39:45.548
You pour us a glass.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.717
I'll be right up.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.787
Okay.

40:08.673 --> 40:09.739
Oh, yeah.

40:14.179 --> 40:17.147
We've waited a
long time for this.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.651
Buckle up, nerd.
