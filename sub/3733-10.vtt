00:01.330 --> 00:03.662
- Previously on Hannibal
- I want you to help me.

00:03.700 --> 00:06.692
You've read about it.
- This is a very shy boy, Will.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.702
I would love to meet him.
- I'm Francis Dolarhyde.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.699
Ms. McClane, can I give you
a ride home?

00:14.340 --> 00:17.503
- (Hannibal): Have you
considered the possibility that
he may believe he is disfigured?

00:17.550 --> 00:20.041
- May I touch your face?
I just want to know

00:20.080 --> 00:22.389
if you're smiling or frowning.
- I'm smiling.

00:22.420 --> 00:25.787
[Hello, Dr. Lecter.]
- What are you becoming?

00:25.820 --> 00:30.280
- (hoarsely): [The Great
Red Dragon.]

00:36.130 --> 00:39.429
Buh... Pa! Pa!

00:39.470 --> 00:45.409
Buh... Buh... Buh...

00:45.440 --> 00:48.671
Shuh”.

00:48.710 --> 00:51.270
Reh.

00:51.310 --> 00:53.312
Reh!

00:54.850 --> 00:56.340
Buh!

00:56.390 --> 01:00.110
Reh! Meh! Keh!

01:43.500 --> 01:46.389
(clunk)
(electricity buzzing)

02:27.810 --> 02:30.779
(phone ringing)

02:30.810 --> 02:34.177
(high-pitched beeping)

02:34.220 --> 02:35.812
- (man): [Baltimore State
Hospital.]

02:35.850 --> 02:38.580
- (Francis): Hello. My name
is Byron Metcalf.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.509
I'm Hannibal Lecter's lawyer.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.653
- One moment, please.

02:43.690 --> 02:46.727
- I'll hold.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.568
- (Hannibal): [Hello?]
(inhaling sharply)

03:00.910 --> 03:03.344
- Hello,

03:03.380 --> 03:05.746
Dr. Lecter.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.480
As an avid fan,

03:14.520 --> 03:16.920
I wanted to tell you that

03:16.960 --> 03:20.498
I'm delighted

03:20.530 --> 03:23.192
that you have taken
an interest in me.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.294
I don't believe

03:27.340 --> 03:29.706
you would tell them who I am,

03:29.740 --> 03:32.231
even if you knew.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.430
- [What particular body]

03:34.480 --> 03:36.675
[you currently occupy
is trivial.]

03:36.710 --> 03:38.678
(laughing quietly)

03:38.710 --> 03:41.474
- I knew that you alone

03:41.520 --> 03:44.512
would understand this.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.451
The important thing

03:47.490 --> 03:50.584
is what I am becoming.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.724
- [Tell me:]

03:53.760 --> 03:56.695
[what are you becoming?]

04:00.900 --> 04:02.868
- (hoarsely): The Great...

04:02.910 --> 04:05.765
Red...

04:05.810 --> 04:09.598
Dragon.

04:15.050 --> 04:18.884
I have admired you for years

04:18.920 --> 04:20.751
and I have _
a complete collection

04:20.790 --> 04:24.419
of your press notices.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.894
Actually,

04:26.930 --> 04:30.525
I think of them
as unfair reVIews.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.502
- As unfair as yours?

04:36.540 --> 04:37.268
They like to sling

04:37.310 --> 04:40.939
demeaning nicknames,
don't they?

04:40.980 --> 04:44.347
- "Tooth Fairy".

04:45.350 --> 04:48.012
- What could _be more
Inappropriate?

04:50.450 --> 04:53.783
- It would shame me
for you to see that,

04:53.820 --> 04:56.618
if I didn't know that you

04:56.660 --> 04:59.026
have suffered the same
distortions in the press.

05:01.030 --> 05:04.921
- You've read
Freddie Lounds's latest?

05:04.970 --> 05:06.961
- It's not a good
picture of you.

05:09.940 --> 05:14.832
- Your speech is bent and pruned
by disabilities,

05:14.880 --> 05:15.539
real and imagined,

05:15.580 --> 05:20.313
but your words are startling.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.983
- I want

05:25.020 --> 05:29.480
to be recognized by you.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.519
- As John the Baptist

05:30.560 --> 05:33.950
recognized the one
who came after.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.888
- I want

05:35.930 --> 05:37.818
to sit before you

05:37.870 --> 05:43.035
as the Dragon sat before 666
in Revelation.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.106
I have...

05:45.140 --> 05:50.544
...things I would
love to show you.

05:50.580 --> 05:51.979
Someday,

05:52.010 --> 05:54.717
if circumstances permit,

05:54.750 --> 05:57.583
I would like to meet you

05:57.620 --> 06:00.453
and watch you...

06:00.490 --> 06:02.526
meld...

06:02.560 --> 06:05.586
...with the strength
of the Dragon.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.028
- See how magnificent you are?

06:14.770 --> 06:17.102
"Did he who made the Lamb
make thee?"

06:17.140 --> 06:20.735
(snarling)

06:20.780 --> 06:23.101
(theme music playing)

06:44.670 --> 06:49.039
- I awoke in
the fresh-smelling semidark,

06:49.070 --> 06:52.005
knowing in some primal way

06:52.040 --> 06:55.077
that I was near the sea.

06:55.110 --> 06:59.046
Day and evening again,

06:59.080 --> 07:02.618
the smell of fresh flowers

07:02.650 --> 07:04.618
and the vague awareness

07:04.650 --> 07:08.609
of a needle bleeding into me.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.652
He never called me my name.

07:11.690 --> 07:15.194
That was strange at first,

07:15.230 --> 07:20.190
and then it wasn't strange.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.209
And then

07:23.240 --> 07:25.959
my name

07:26.010 --> 07:28.433
was Lydia Fell.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.788
Deeply-felt truths
about myself

07:36.820 --> 07:39.755
as Bedelia Du Maurier

07:39.790 --> 07:43.954
were smoke and mirrors
of the highest order.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.723
What we take for granted

07:49.770 --> 07:52.068
about our sense of self,

07:52.100 --> 07:54.068
everything we see,

07:54.100 --> 07:57.866
everything we remember,

07:57.910 --> 08:00.003
is nothing more

08:00.040 --> 08:02.645
than a construct

08:02.680 --> 08:06.616
of the mind.

08:06.650 --> 08:09.847
Dante was the first
to conceive

08:09.890 --> 08:13.610
of hell as a planned space.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.686
An urban environment.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.689
Before Dante, we spoke not
of the Gates of Hell,

08:20.730 --> 08:23.221
but of the Mouth

08:23.270 --> 08:26.159
of Hell.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.704
My journey to damnation began

08:29.740 --> 08:32.709
when I was swallowed

08:32.740 --> 08:35.072
by the beast.

08:35.110 --> 08:37.874
(applause)

08:41.020 --> 08:43.011
Thank you.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.024
- Poor, Dr. Du Maurier

08:53.060 --> 08:55.699
swallowed whole.

08:55.730 --> 08:58.164
Suffering inside Hannibal
Lecter's bowels

08:58.200 --> 09:02.739
for what must have felt like
an eternity.

09:02.770 --> 09:03.998
You didn't lose yourself,
Bedelia,

09:04.040 --> 09:08.830
you just crawled so far up his
ass you couldn't be bothered.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.871
- Hello, Will.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.238
- You hitched your star
to a man

09:13.280 --> 09:17.148
commonly known
as a monster.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.819
You're the
Bride of Frankenstein.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.055
- We've both been his bride.

09:23.090 --> 09:25.957
- How did you manage
to walk away unscarred?

09:25.990 --> 09:27.696
Huh?

09:27.730 --> 09:32.736
I'm covered in scars.
- I wasn't myself.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.859
You were.

09:35.900 --> 09:38.209
Even when you weren't,
you were.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.870
- I wasn't wearing adequate
armour.
- No.

09:42.910 --> 09:46.038
You were naked.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.311
Have you been to see him?

09:53.060 --> 09:55.187
- Yes.

09:57.660 --> 10:00.697
- You haven't learned
your lesson, have you?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.994
Or did you just

10:03.030 --> 10:05.863
miss him that much?

10:11.010 --> 10:13.137
- Have you been to see him?

10:13.180 --> 10:16.900
- I've seen enough of him.

10:18.910 --> 10:22.175
I was with him
behind the veil.

10:22.220 --> 10:25.883
You were always
on the other side.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.158
- Something we should
talk about.

10:32.190 --> 10:34.351
- You'll have to make
an appomtment.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.338
- We're at the zoo.

10:54.380 --> 10:57.087
Why are we at the 200?
It's cold for the zoo.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.218
- Did you ever

11:01.260 --> 11:04.423
see a tiger?

11:04.460 --> 11:06.724
- No.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.264
- They're working on its tooth

11:11.300 --> 11:16.932
and they have
to put him to sleep.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.165
If you want,

11:19.210 --> 11:21.804
you can touch him.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.040
You wanna do it?

11:55.510 --> 11:58.479
- It's in here.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.013
- How do I know
he's sound asleep?

12:01.050 --> 12:03.348
- Tickle him.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.084
- (man): Do you have
a general impression?

12:09.120 --> 12:11.918
I can describe
as much as you like.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.258
Put your left hand
on the edge of the table.

12:14.300 --> 12:20.364
You can explore with
your right. Take your time.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.039
-D?

12:23.070 --> 12:26.233
I'd like you to tell me
what you see,

12:26.270 --> 12:29.398
if you don't mind.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.444
- He's...striking.

12:34.350 --> 12:37.342
Orange and black stripes.

12:40.560 --> 12:45.987
The orange is so bright,

12:46.030 --> 12:48.191
it's almost

12:48.230 --> 12:52.223
bleeding into the air
around him.

12:52.270 --> 12:56.388
It's radiant.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.343
(breath trembling)

13:04.380 --> 13:08.111
I'm right here with you.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.012
(low purring)

13:45.420 --> 13:49.288
(soft laugh)

13:58.670 --> 14:01.434
(gasping)

15:05.400 --> 15:10.531
(gentle piano music playing)

15:12.540 --> 15:15.008
(sniffing)

15:45.740 --> 15:48.334
- That was a very
elegant gesture.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.575
Eloquent, too.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.046
Maybe the most eloquent thing
I ever heard of.

16:03.090 --> 16:04.580
That tiger,

16:04.630 --> 16:06.586
this house...

16:06.630 --> 16:10.088
You're full of surprises, D.

16:10.130 --> 16:13.031
I don't think anyone at Gateway
knows you at all.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.565
- Did you ask them?
- No.

16:21.640 --> 16:25.371
- Then how do you know
nobody knows me?

16:25.410 --> 16:28.072
- Because they wonder
about you.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.214
They wonder about everything.

16:32.190 --> 16:36.388
They find you very mysterious.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.161
- Did they tell you how I look?

16:45.800 --> 16:48.439
- I didn't ask them.

16:48.470 --> 16:51.337
But, yes, they told me.

16:51.370 --> 16:53.429
Do you want to hear it?

16:53.480 --> 16:57.200
Don't ask if you don't.

17:05.850 --> 17:10.526
- I think I'll tell you.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.449
They said you have
a kind of

17:13.500 --> 17:16.719
hard, clean

17:16.760 --> 17:20.298
neatness that they like.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.400
They say you're very
sensitive about your face

17:23.440 --> 17:26.637
and that you shouldn't be.
Where the hell are you?

17:35.150 --> 17:37.118
Ah!

17:37.150 --> 17:40.278
Here you are.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.483
Do you want to know
what I think?

17:47.500 --> 17:50.298
(grunting softly)

18:37.550 --> 18:40.371
(slow shattering sound)
(Francis' breath trembling)

18:40.420 --> 18:43.548
(grunting)

18:55.200 --> 18:57.760
I hope I didn't shock you.

19:03.470 --> 19:07.372
(quick gasp)

19:09.840 --> 19:12.502
(rhythmic music playing)

19:31.670 --> 19:34.491
(distorted gasps
and heavy breathing)

19:44.810 --> 19:46.801
(Reba moaning)

21:49.000 --> 21:53.334
(screeching horn)
(low roar)

21:53.380 --> 21:55.371
(gasping)

22:37.490 --> 22:41.415
(growing dissonant humming)
(groaning)

22:45.630 --> 22:48.349
(humming ceases)

23:01.580 --> 23:06.540
Good morning.

23:06.580 --> 23:09.674
- Good morning.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.488
- I really had
a terrific time, D.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.988
- (panting): Good.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.649
Me, too.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.157
- But I need to go home now.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.829
- Yes. Good.

23:26.870 --> 23:30.169
I'll take you now.

23:36.910 --> 23:39.174
(door opening)

23:42.050 --> 23:44.917
- Go behind your worktable.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.549
If you approach the barrier
before you hear the lock snap,

23:50.590 --> 23:52.956
I'll mace you in the face.
Understand?

23:52.990 --> 23:55.527
- Yes, indeed.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.932
Thank you so much, Denise.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.001
(lock clicking)

24:18.920 --> 24:19.944
- (man): [Are you ready
for your call?]

24:19.990 --> 24:23.482
- Yes, please.
(phone ringing)

24:29.730 --> 24:34.099
- (man): [You've reached the
offices of Byron--]
(dial tone)

24:39.640 --> 24:42.006
(ringing)
- [Operator.]

24:42.040 --> 24:45.043
- Operator, I don't have the use
of my hands.

24:45.080 --> 24:49.540
Could you please ring
667-JL5-0102?

24:49.580 --> 24:51.844
- [Of course. Have a nice day.]
- Thank you.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.881
(ringing)

24:56.560 --> 24:59.529
- (woman): [Dr. Frederick
Chilton's office.]
- Is this Linda?

24:59.560 --> 25:01.824
- [Linda doesn't come in
on weekends.]

25:01.860 --> 25:05.626
- Maybe you could help me,
if you don't mind.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.935
This is Bob Greer at
Blaine and Edwards Publishing.

25:08.970 --> 25:11.962
Dr. Chilton asked me to send
a copy of his book to someone,

25:12.010 --> 25:13.978
and Linda was supposed
to give me

25:14.010 --> 25:16.831
the address and phone number,
but she never did.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.905
- [She'll be in on Monday.]

25:18.950 --> 25:21.919
- I have to catch Federal
Express in about five minutes,

25:21.950 --> 25:24.316
and I don't want to bother
Frederick at home.

25:24.350 --> 25:27.649
It's right there
in his contacts.

25:27.690 --> 25:30.181
I'll dance at your wedding

25:30.220 --> 25:33.018
if you'll read it to me.
- [I'm opening the file.]

25:33.060 --> 25:36.052
- Be a darling and slide that
cursor down to the letter G,

25:36.100 --> 25:38.796
give it a click and I'll be out
of your hair.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.094
- [Alright. What was the name?]

25:41.140 --> 25:44.928
- Graham.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.961
Will Graham.

25:54.080 --> 25:56.048
- (Will): Have you had
any contact with him?

25:56.080 --> 25:59.345
- (Bedelia): He sends me
greeting cards

25:59.390 --> 26:02.109
on Christian holidays
and my birthday.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.620
He always includes a recipe.

26:08.630 --> 26:10.723
- If he does end up
eating you, Bedelia,

26:10.770 --> 26:13.022
you'd have it coming.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.099
- I can't blame him for doing

26:17.140 --> 26:19.358
what evolution
has equipped him to do.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.731
- If we just do

26:21.780 --> 26:25.079
wha_tever evolution
eqUIpped us to do,

26:25.110 --> 26:28.614
murder and cannibalism

26:28.650 --> 26:30.140
are morally acceptable.

26:30.180 --> 26:32.717
- They are acceptable --

26:32.750 --> 26:34.854
to murderers and cannibals.

26:34.890 --> 26:36.983
And you.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.352
- And you.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.867
You lied, Bedelia.

26:44.900 --> 26:48.358
You do that a lot.

26:48.400 --> 26:52.131
Why do you
do that a lot?

26:54.940 --> 26:57.170
- I obfuscate.

26:57.210 --> 27:01.317
Hannibal was_ never
not my patient.

27:01.350 --> 27:04.217
Covert treatment

27:04.250 --> 27:07.048
suffers secrecy

27:07.090 --> 27:09.058
and disapproval.

27:09.090 --> 27:12.719
- Covert because...

27:12.760 --> 27:15.820
...Hannibal was _
an uncooperative patient?

27:15.860 --> 27:19.660
- Covert because I_wa_s
a cooperative psychiatrist.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.206
"Do no harm."

27:25.240 --> 27:29.131
- And did you?

27:29.180 --> 27:32.445
- I did.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.948
Technically.

27:34.980 --> 27:38.040
- You dared to care.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.980
- Not the first time I've lost

27:43.020 --> 27:45.329
professional objectivity

27:45.360 --> 27:48.818
in a matter where Hannibal
is concerned.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.291
- What did he tell you?

27:58.970 --> 28:02.804
- I think he told you
that I'm paranoid.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.149
- Are you?
- Yes.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.071
But that's not to suggest
I don't have good reason to be.

28:11.120 --> 28:14.487
- You don't trust Dr_. Lecter.
- No, there's something wrong

28:14.520 --> 28:17.284
with Dr. Lecter.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.924
- Did you think that way

28:18.960 --> 28:21.019
before he ended
the doctor-patient relationship?

28:21.060 --> 28:23.790
- No, it's why he ended it.
He knew I knew.

28:23.830 --> 28:27.891
I went to him mildly depressed,
had trouble sleeping.

28:27.940 --> 28:33.139
I ended up wildly depressed,
not sleeping at all.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.933
- You_believe
your condition worsened

28:34.980 --> 28:36.936
under Dr. Lecter's care?

28:36.980 --> 28:39.301
- "Care"?

28:39.350 --> 28:45.744
He told me to eat more red meat
and wrote a prescription.

28:45.790 --> 28:48.350
- And have you been taking
the medication he prescribed?

28:48.390 --> 28:51.359
- Hell, no!

28:51.390 --> 28:53.995
He wanted
to administer phototherapy

28:54.030 --> 28:57.124
to advance my circadian rhythms,
help me sleep,

28:57.160 --> 29:00.391
but it wasn't phototherapy.
He stuck me in front of a light

29:00.430 --> 29:02.990
and I woke up somewhere else.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.008
- Dr. Lecter told me you had

29:05.040 --> 29:07.099
a seizure response
to phototherapy.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.871
- No, he did something to me.

29:10.910 --> 29:14.812
- You experienced
a traumatic event that you now

29:14.850 --> 29:16.818
associate with Dr. Lecter.

29:16.850 --> 29:20.149
- I nearly choked on my own
tongue and he remained
indifferent.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.081
- How is one patient

29:24.130 --> 29:27.088
worthy of compassion

29:27.130 --> 29:29.519
and another not?

29:29.560 --> 29:33.223
- I'm under no illusion

29:33.270 --> 29:37.058
how morally consistent
my compassion has been.

29:39.270 --> 29:42.433
How is one murderer
worthy of compa55ion

29:42.480 --> 29:44.471
and not another?

29:47.080 --> 29:49.446
- All that time
you were with Hannibal

29:49.480 --> 29:53.211
behind the veil,

29:53.250 --> 29:58.085
you'd already killed
one patient.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.354
It ever occur to you
to kill another?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.120
- My relationship with Hannibal

30:07.170 --> 30:10.958
is not as passionate as yours.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.205
You are here

30:13.240 --> 30:16.129
visiting an old flame.

30:19.950 --> 30:22.578
Is your wife aware

30:22.620 --> 30:25.145
of how intimately
you and Hannibal

30:25.190 --> 30:27.408
know each other?

30:29.520 --> 30:31.988
- She's aware enough.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.389
- You couldn't
save Hannibal.

30:40.670 --> 30:43.389
Do you think you can
save this new one?

30:45.510 --> 30:49.037
Your experience
of Hannibal's attention

30:49.080 --> 30:52.072
is so profoundly harmful,

30:52.110 --> 30:56.479
yet so irresistible,

30:58.550 --> 31:02.350
it undermines your ability
to think rationally.

31:02.390 --> 31:04.984
- I am thinking rationally.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.385
- You've made some
very serious accusations.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.455
- Actionable accusations?

31:09.500 --> 31:13.596
- Yes.
- And have you -- taken action?

31:13.630 --> 31:16.098
- Is that what you
want me to do?

31:16.140 --> 31:20.133
- Isn't that what
you're supposed to do
on my behalf? And you haven't.

31:20.170 --> 31:23.435
- I am not firmly convinced

31:23.480 --> 31:24.902
_ it would_ be
in your best interest.

31:24.950 --> 31:31.514
- I am not firmly convinced you
give a rat's ass about
my best interest.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.245
Do you believe me?

31:33.290 --> 31:34.552
- I believe you are

31:34.590 --> 31:38.219
experiencing a lack of insight.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.923
I am trying to assist you in
regaining enough insight

31:41.960 --> 31:45.191
that you realize
that you require medication.

31:45.230 --> 31:48.336
(scoffing)

31:48.370 --> 31:51.168
- What medication would you
prescribe, Dr. Du Maurier?

31:53.470 --> 31:55.609
- I would prescribe
exactly the medication

31:55.640 --> 31:58.177
Dr. Lecter prescribed
and you refused.

31:58.210 --> 32:01.611
- You know, whatever this is,
whatever this is,

32:01.650 --> 32:04.483
this is why Scientologists
hate psychiatry.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.616
- What do you think "this" is?

32:10.660 --> 32:14.221
- Of course he would
refer me to you!

32:14.260 --> 32:17.024
You're just as twisted as he is.

32:19.530 --> 32:21.464
- You're walking
down the street

32:21.500 --> 32:25.607
and you see a wounded bird
in the grass.

32:25.640 --> 32:29.508
What's your first thought?

32:31.750 --> 32:34.617
- It's vulnerable.

32:34.650 --> 32:36.948
I want to help it.

32:39.490 --> 32:42.288
- My first thought
is also that it's vulnerable.

32:45.660 --> 32:48.356
And yet...

32:48.400 --> 32:51.221
I want to crush it.

32:53.270 --> 32:56.660
A primal rejection
of weakness which is

32:56.700 --> 33:02.775
every bit as natural
as the nurturing instinct.

33:02.810 --> 33:05.176
Of course,

33:05.210 --> 33:07.974
I wouldn't crush it,

33:08.780 --> 33:12.716
but my first thought
is to do just that.

33:12.750 --> 33:15.355
- You know, I gave up free will.
I continue to act

33:15.390 --> 33:17.358
and feel as though I have it,
but I don't.

33:17.390 --> 33:20.029
The only reason that I'm here is
that that's what was prescribed.

33:20.060 --> 33:23.154
- Neil. Sit down.
- No! No.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.727
This is culty and weird--
(choking)

33:29.400 --> 33:39.446
(gagging)

33:39.450 --> 33:49.052
(gagging)

33:49.090 --> 33:53.220
- Let me help you.
I'm trying to clear

33:53.260 --> 33:54.750
your airway!

33:54.800 --> 33:58.292
(choking)
(Bedelia gasps)

34:12.850 --> 34:15.045
(dissonant humming)

34:32.270 --> 34:34.693
- One thing I learned
from Hannibal

34:34.740 --> 34:40.133
is the alchemy
of lies and truths.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.603
It's how he convinced you

34:41.640 --> 34:45.303
you're a killer.

34:45.350 --> 34:48.808
- You're not convinced?

34:48.850 --> 34:51.819
- You're not a killer.

34:52.450 --> 34:55.419
You're capable
of righteous violence

34:55.460 --> 34:58.782
because you are compassionate.

35:01.730 --> 35:03.789
- How are you capable?

35:03.830 --> 35:06.765
(inhaling slowly)

35:06.800 --> 35:10.588
- Extreme acts
of cruelty reqUIre...

35:10.640 --> 35:14.303
...a high level of empathy.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.171
The next time you have an
instinct to help someone,

35:23.220 --> 35:26.485
you might consider
crushing them instead.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.883
It might save you

35:31.930 --> 35:35.320
a great deal of trouble.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.937
- It was done
carefully and cleanly

35:50.980 --> 35:53.869
with a very sharp knife.

35:53.910 --> 35:56.879
It was not the work
of a child.

35:59.420 --> 36:02.548
- It's a Chinese character
which means, "You hit it,"

36:02.590 --> 36:05.923
an expression sometimes
used in gambling.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.599
- A lucky sign.

36:08.630 --> 36:12.418
The character also appears

36:12.470 --> 36:14.335
on a mahjong tile.

36:14.370 --> 36:18.534
Marks the Red Dragon.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.975
- Are you familiar
with William Blake's

36:29.020 --> 36:31.784
The Great Red Dragon
and the Woman Clothed in Sun?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.788
Blake's Dragon

36:33.820 --> 36:35.879
stands over a pleading woman

36:35.920 --> 36:39.287
caught in the coil of its tail.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.821
Few images in Western art

36:41.860 --> 36:45.921
radiate such a unique and...

36:45.970 --> 36:49.292
...nightmarish charge
of demonic sexuality.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.939
- The man who killed
the Jacobis and the Leedses

36:56.980 --> 37:00.404
saw something in them
that drew him

37:00.450 --> 37:02.645
and drove him to do it.
He chose them

37:02.680 --> 37:05.387
because something in them

37:05.420 --> 37:08.651
spoke to him.

37:08.690 --> 37:11.682
- The Jacobis were
the first to help him,

37:11.730 --> 37:16.349
the first to lift him into
the glory of his becoming.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.925
The Jacobis were better
than anything he knew.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.926
- Until the Leedses.

37:20.970 --> 37:24.758
- As the Dragon grows
in strength and glory,

37:24.810 --> 37:26.732
there are families to come.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.777
- I have to believe
there is a common factor

37:34.780 --> 37:38.716
and we will find it -- soon.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.685
- Otherwise you have
to enter more houses

37:41.720 --> 37:44.655
and see what the Dragon
has left for you.

37:44.690 --> 37:47.989
11 days to the next full moon.

37:48.030 --> 37:52.467
Tick-tock.

37:52.500 --> 37:55.492
I like this Dragon, Will.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.930
I don't think he's crazy at all.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.005
(drawer latch clicking)

38:00.040 --> 38:03.999
I think he may be quite sane.

38:06.810 --> 38:09.870
A magnificent thing,

38:09.920 --> 38:11.342
to watch the world

38:11.390 --> 38:14.587
through his red haze.

38:27.570 --> 38:30.789
- Sign the register, please.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.331
- Painting Study.
Miss Harper.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.779
- Mr. Crane?
I'm Paula Harper.

38:49.820 --> 38:52.983
You called about
the Blake watercolour?

38:53.030 --> 38:59.469
Come with me. I'll show it
to you. You'll need this.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.421
- The museum

39:00.470 --> 39:02.859
is closed to the general public
on Tuesdays,

39:02.900 --> 39:04.504
but art class

39:04.540 --> 39:06.633
and researchers are admitted.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.877
May I ask
what you're researching?

39:08.910 --> 39:10.935
- A paper on Butts.

39:10.980 --> 39:13.107
- On Thomas Butts?

39:13.150 --> 39:16.642
You only see him in footnotes
as a patron of Blake's.

39:19.890 --> 39:23.519
Is he interesting?
- I'm just beginning.

39:26.690 --> 39:28.123
- We have to keep it
in this box

39:28.160 --> 39:29.718
because light will fade it.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.024
That's why it's not
on display often.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.061
You understand you're not
allowed to touch it?

39:34.100 --> 39:37.934
I'll display it for you --
that's the rule. OK?

39:40.170 --> 39:43.139
Isn't it stunning?
Even the best

39:43.180 --> 39:46.946
reproductions can't possibly
do the colours justice.

39:46.980 --> 39:49.710
It appears he used chalk
as well as--

40:05.700 --> 40:07.691
(breathing heavily)

40:27.020 --> 40:29.056
(moaning slightly)

40:36.000 --> 40:39.424
(sniffing deeply)

41:04.790 --> 41:06.929
- It's just this way,
Mr. Graham.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.154
You know,
you're the second person

41:08.190 --> 41:10.556
who's asked to see
the Blake today.

41:12.630 --> 41:16.498
(grunting excitedly)

41:23.610 --> 41:26.272
- Wait here.
Paula, I have another visitor

41:26.310 --> 41:28.517
for The Great Red Dragon.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.115
Paula?

42:10.360 --> 42:12.578
(Will grunting and coughing)

42:30.610 --> 42:32.999
(theme music playing)

42:35.620 --> 42:38.612
