WEBVTT

01:36.218 --> 01:39.656
Please God, don't kill me.

01:42.593 --> 01:44.295
It was just work.

01:44.328 --> 01:45.630
I needed the money.

01:46.830 --> 01:48.766
Well, I guess you've
been paid in lead.

01:51.334 --> 01:52.669
There a warrant for me?

01:53.903 --> 01:55.772
Speak true and I'll
take away your pain.

02:03.846 --> 02:05.248
Tickle much?

02:23.332 --> 02:24.332
Please.

02:26.168 --> 02:27.971
Hey.

02:28.005 --> 02:29.140
Don't, don't you kill me.

02:30.072 --> 02:31.075
I have a family.

02:33.243 --> 02:36.246
You've been gut shot. You're
in the middle of nowhere.

02:36.279 --> 02:38.816
You don't wanna bleed out here.

02:38.849 --> 02:40.684
Buzzards, they'll start
picking out your body

02:40.717 --> 02:41.819
before you finish passing.

02:44.755 --> 02:46.023
Please God. No.

03:08.712 --> 03:09.712
Stewart.

03:10.846 --> 03:11.846
Come on out.

03:31.701 --> 03:33.069
Is he dead?

03:33.102 --> 03:34.705
Yeah, he's dead.

03:43.046 --> 03:44.682
$2,000.

03:47.050 --> 03:48.251
You know what this means?

03:49.719 --> 03:53.389
Yeah. More bounty
hunters on our trail.

03:53.422 --> 03:55.358
Lots more men coming to collect.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.094
More gunfire, more killing.

03:59.762 --> 04:01.898
I don't think I can handle this.

04:01.932 --> 04:05.803
Stewart, if you ain't
got the guts for this life,

04:05.836 --> 04:07.904
then maybe you should
get yourself elsewhere.

04:14.177 --> 04:16.113
I, I thought I could do this.

04:17.848 --> 04:18.848
Be like you.

04:21.117 --> 04:22.117
But I can't.

04:23.787 --> 04:25.156
Take his guns, his belt.

04:26.922 --> 04:28.893
You should get some
good money for 'em.

04:30.893 --> 04:31.994
Really?

04:32.028 --> 04:33.030
Leave the bullets.

04:46.109 --> 04:48.212
I hate to tell you this.

04:49.812 --> 04:53.216
Horses ran off
when the shooting started.

04:55.018 --> 04:56.387
That horse I was riding?

04:59.122 --> 05:00.256
Yeah, that one too.

05:03.093 --> 05:04.093
They got spooked.

05:08.532 --> 05:11.435
No horse, no money,
and a bounty on my trail.

05:13.937 --> 05:15.239
Smart you walk away, kid.

05:17.139 --> 05:18.139
Go on.

05:20.876 --> 05:23.446
You're gonna need
money to get out of town.

05:23.480 --> 05:24.982
Maybe get a train ticket.

05:26.850 --> 05:28.986
You gonna take that job
I done told you about?

05:29.018 --> 05:33.290
Now that I ain't got no
horse, I don't have no choice.

05:33.323 --> 05:34.525
What do you mean?

05:36.059 --> 05:36.893
This wouldn't be the
first, second, or 10th time

05:36.927 --> 05:38.496
you killed for money.

05:39.461 --> 05:41.531
No, it ain't, kid.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.240
It's been a real
honor knowing you.

05:52.441 --> 05:55.045
Sorry I can't ride
with you no more.

07:39.049 --> 07:40.049
I have no money.

07:40.716 --> 07:42.018
You carrying a shootin' iron?

07:42.052 --> 07:43.420
None.

07:43.453 --> 07:46.189
In fact, I have nothing that
would tempt a highway man.

07:46.222 --> 07:48.058
Where's the pity?

07:48.090 --> 07:49.167
I've been called
a lot of things,

07:49.191 --> 07:51.061
but a thief ain't one of 'em.

07:53.129 --> 07:56.266
Oh I see, you're a wanted man.

07:56.299 --> 07:57.434
May I ask for what?

07:58.567 --> 08:01.537
Nothin' you want a part of.

08:01.571 --> 08:04.574
If you'd consider putting
that gun down for a moment,

08:04.607 --> 08:06.510
perhaps we could converse.

08:08.211 --> 08:09.211
You alone?

08:10.379 --> 08:12.548
I never answer at gunpoint.

08:23.059 --> 08:24.528
I'm alone.

08:24.561 --> 08:27.698
I just come here to get water
from the creek every morning.

08:27.730 --> 08:29.632
Church is uh, nearby.

08:29.665 --> 08:31.343
Would you like to come
with me and talk there?

08:31.367 --> 08:33.436
You got horses at your church?

08:33.469 --> 08:35.372
I'd be riding if we did.

08:35.405 --> 08:37.240
Would you like to
come up and see?

08:37.272 --> 08:39.976
Man on the run ain't got
time for a friendly stroll.

08:41.210 --> 08:42.745
That poster reads
that you're wanted

08:42.779 --> 08:44.682
for multiple counts of murder.

08:46.216 --> 08:47.250
Well.

08:48.450 --> 08:51.287
Ain't you got sharp eyes, padre.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.755
My ears work as well.

08:52.789 --> 08:53.789
You hear it?

08:58.093 --> 09:01.364
A wanted man I think
should hide out of sight.

09:01.397 --> 09:04.133
If you promise to
refrain from violence,

09:04.166 --> 09:06.569
I promise to send
them on their way.

09:31.261 --> 09:32.695
Good day to you, father.

09:32.728 --> 09:34.464
Good day.

09:35.564 --> 09:37.266
Have you seen this man?

09:40.804 --> 09:43.040
I'm afraid I can't help you.

09:43.073 --> 09:44.073
Well.

09:45.275 --> 09:46.275
Thank you, father.

09:47.276 --> 09:48.478
You keep a watch, now.

09:50.146 --> 09:52.549
Can I give you a ride into
town or up to the church?

09:52.582 --> 09:55.318
I'm right where the
good Lord needs me to be.

09:55.351 --> 09:56.253
Thank you.

09:56.285 --> 09:58.255
Well thank you, father.

10:25.615 --> 10:26.615
Padre,

10:28.117 --> 10:29.819
you could've made
yourself a rich man.

10:31.487 --> 10:33.689
Dollars don't interest
me, but your soul does.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.494
Well, you allowed
me another sunrise,

10:37.526 --> 10:39.496
and for that I'm grateful.

10:39.529 --> 10:41.431
It's good you know what
it is to be grateful,

10:41.463 --> 10:43.467
means there's hope for you.

10:43.500 --> 10:47.504
Hope? Hope's like time, it
ain't never been on my side.

10:48.872 --> 10:50.774
I think we met for a reason.

10:50.806 --> 10:53.442
Padre, trust me, your Lord,

10:53.476 --> 10:55.645
he ain't got no use
for a man like me.

10:55.678 --> 10:58.381
You may have turned
your back on the Lord,

10:58.414 --> 11:00.818
but the Lord has not
turned his back on you.

11:01.885 --> 11:02.885
I can show you.

11:04.420 --> 11:07.457
Padre, you could wash me
in the blood of the savior,

11:07.490 --> 11:10.360
but it ain't gonna wash
the blood from these hands.

11:10.392 --> 11:12.137
That you call him savior
means that your faith

11:12.161 --> 11:13.729
hasn't deserted you.

11:13.762 --> 11:16.867
A moment ago, I held
your life in my hands.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.337
That you're still standing
at this moment is his doing.

11:22.704 --> 11:23.704
Wouldn't you agree?

11:24.774 --> 11:27.477
I give you back to God, my son.

11:27.510 --> 11:31.148
Go, from this hour no
longer an agent of evil.

11:31.180 --> 11:33.415
The devil no longer your guide.

12:01.777 --> 12:02.777
Mrs. Boswell.

12:07.650 --> 12:08.651
Who are you?

12:08.684 --> 12:10.286
I'm a gun for hire, ma'am.

12:13.488 --> 12:15.492
I heard you got a call
for a fellow like me.

12:20.229 --> 12:22.298
I didn't think
anyone would come.

12:35.811 --> 12:37.413
You sure you wanna do this?

12:38.548 --> 12:39.883
You think I'm a monster?

12:39.915 --> 12:41.550
No, ma'am I've seen monsters.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.487
I just want to be sure
that you're certain

12:44.886 --> 12:48.491
that you wanna go through
with this, to the end.

12:53.563 --> 12:55.631
He was wrapped in
this when he was born.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.436
We had hoped the
doctors were wrong but,

13:01.703 --> 13:03.439
as he grew, he never spoke.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.475
Never called me mama.

13:08.578 --> 13:09.746
He never smiled at me.

13:12.649 --> 13:14.451
My son was born wrong, you see.

13:15.584 --> 13:16.584
Feeble-minded.

13:19.488 --> 13:21.458
There was nothing
the doctors could do.

13:23.593 --> 13:25.996
They said I waited too
long to have a baby,

13:26.029 --> 13:29.466
and this was a common
occurrence among older mothers.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.669
I didn't realize it at the time.

13:32.702 --> 13:33.702
Had I known.

13:36.905 --> 13:39.742
Doctor said he wouldn't
live very long but,

13:41.577 --> 13:43.814
each time he's fallen,
I've been there.

13:45.681 --> 13:48.751
He's never dirty or hungry.

13:51.386 --> 13:52.856
And all that should
bring me joy.

13:54.824 --> 13:56.260
But there's only misery.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.266
My husband left.

14:03.433 --> 14:04.635
He couldn't take it anymore.

14:05.868 --> 14:09.439
Said the boy's an abomination,
and it's a sin to raise him.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.044
I don't want this anymore.

14:16.545 --> 14:20.983
I have a dream, to get
back with my husband.

14:21.016 --> 14:26.022
We can adopt a normal, healthy
child and live a happy life.

14:29.592 --> 14:31.928
You see, I'm not a bad person.

14:35.430 --> 14:38.334
I can do what you
need done, ma'am.

14:38.367 --> 14:39.367
Thank you, sir.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.876
You don't know what
this means to me.

14:49.578 --> 14:53.449
I've wanted to do it myself
but, I just couldn't.

14:56.752 --> 14:58.987
What do I call you, good sir?

14:59.021 --> 15:00.457
What's your name?

15:00.490 --> 15:02.125
My name and what I'm
about to do, ma'am,

15:02.157 --> 15:04.460
are two things
you'd best forget.

15:05.527 --> 15:06.562
He's still my lil.

15:08.897 --> 15:10.633
Please make sure
he doesn't suffer.

15:12.034 --> 15:13.034
I will.

15:14.904 --> 15:16.807
There's a grave
site up the hill.

15:17.839 --> 15:20.075
That's where I buried my father.

15:20.108 --> 15:22.711
I left a shovel for
you, or if you want,

15:22.745 --> 15:23.646
- I can help you...
- No, no.

15:23.679 --> 15:25.048
Ma'am, that won't be necessary.

15:26.681 --> 15:28.517
You'll hear two
shots close together,

15:29.751 --> 15:30.886
then you'll know it's done.

15:53.608 --> 15:54.944
Come on, boy.

17:07.550 --> 17:08.717
Darlin'.

17:08.751 --> 17:10.587
- Hey.
- How I've missed you so.

17:10.619 --> 17:13.956
Our bed has been cold
without you, lonely.

17:13.990 --> 17:16.826
But, now that you're back,
all shall be as it was.

17:16.858 --> 17:19.261
Let me still my prattling.

17:19.294 --> 17:20.734
Were you able to
bring the cattle in?

17:20.762 --> 17:22.698
Did you make the
money you'd hoped for?

17:27.869 --> 17:29.738
You're so thin.

17:29.771 --> 17:33.242
Well, food's been
a little scarce.

17:34.809 --> 17:36.121
Fox took all our chickens,
and the, the crops,

17:36.145 --> 17:38.815
they were spoiled by
flooding a few months ago.

17:38.848 --> 17:40.617
But, now that you're back...

17:42.784 --> 17:44.553
But, but you said uh, when...

17:44.587 --> 17:45.288
What?

17:45.320 --> 17:46.522
When I left last season...

17:46.556 --> 17:47.257
Yeah?

17:47.290 --> 17:49.925
You said that uh, well,

17:49.959 --> 17:51.728
you, you thought
you were pregnant.

17:52.895 --> 17:54.864
And I've been gone
from months now.

17:54.896 --> 17:57.800
I thought you'd be uh, you know,

17:59.935 --> 18:00.935
rounder.

18:02.771 --> 18:04.540
I regret.

18:05.942 --> 18:09.178
I, I was mistaken.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.621
So you're not with child?

18:20.790 --> 18:24.661
I'm not. But, we can try
again now that you're back.

18:24.694 --> 18:27.297
We've been married
for years, Charlotte,

18:27.329 --> 18:29.566
and I'm still without a son.

18:29.598 --> 18:33.836
But in your frustration,
my love, remember,

18:33.868 --> 18:35.638
making the baby is the fun part.

18:36.806 --> 18:39.107
Where'd you learn
to talk so dirty?

18:39.140 --> 18:43.612
All I'm saying is, do
not give in to despair.

18:43.646 --> 18:45.781
We can start fresh.

18:48.084 --> 18:52.689
I love you Charlotte,
but I want a family.

18:53.588 --> 18:54.699
And I told you how
important that was to me

18:54.723 --> 18:56.125
when we first got married.

18:56.157 --> 18:58.962
And it is a gift I wish to
give you in abundance, my love.

19:00.396 --> 19:02.598
Yeah, you've been saying
that year in, year out.

19:02.632 --> 19:04.734
But every damn year
it's the same problem.

19:07.002 --> 19:08.905
What are you,
what are you saying?

19:11.741 --> 19:12.943
I made preparations.

19:14.409 --> 19:16.812
In case I came back to
find you not with child.

19:19.982 --> 19:21.617
I went to the courthouse
on my way home.

19:24.953 --> 19:27.690
Somehow, I just knew you
wasn't gonna be pregnant.

19:27.723 --> 19:29.992
You need to make your
mark on these here papers.

19:30.026 --> 19:32.362
That'll be the divorce,
done and legal.

19:36.365 --> 19:37.733
You love me.

19:37.767 --> 19:38.977
How can you give
up on me like this?

19:39.001 --> 19:41.605
I do love you, but
I need a whole woman.

19:43.938 --> 19:45.340
All right?

19:45.374 --> 19:46.876
One that can bear me children.

19:50.178 --> 19:52.047
You just can't do that.

19:53.281 --> 19:54.384
A whole woman?

19:55.951 --> 19:58.254
One that's fertile.

20:02.692 --> 20:05.694
Is there? Is there someone else?

20:09.698 --> 20:10.698
Who is she?

20:11.399 --> 20:12.434
It's nothin' like that.

20:12.467 --> 20:13.902
Tell me.

20:23.011 --> 20:24.012
Who is she?

20:31.921 --> 20:33.023
It's Mary Sue Olson.

20:35.424 --> 20:37.661
The girl who works
at the mercantile?

20:39.462 --> 20:41.431
Don't make this any
harder than it already is.

20:41.463 --> 20:42.463
All right?

20:43.398 --> 20:45.233
Just go on and
make your mark now.

20:50.004 --> 20:52.175
I'm gonna need my
grandmama's ring back.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.843
No, Bo. You are
not doing this to me.

20:54.876 --> 20:57.879
You can't just take all of a
person's heart and cast it off

20:59.013 --> 21:00.716
when and where it pleases you.

21:04.419 --> 21:05.921
Farewell, Charlotte.

21:09.959 --> 21:12.161
I'll give you back
your father's name.

24:57.386 --> 24:59.088
Come on kid,
let's get outta here

24:59.120 --> 25:01.489
before your mother
realizes what happened.

25:01.522 --> 25:02.522
Come on now.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.084
Something bothering you, boy?

26:05.087 --> 26:06.388
What's the matter?

26:10.392 --> 26:11.728
You're hungry, huh?

26:14.296 --> 26:15.296
Well.

26:19.068 --> 26:20.569
Show you what I've got.

26:27.142 --> 26:28.244
This is all I got.

26:33.682 --> 26:36.319
Try it. It's good.

26:42.390 --> 26:45.527
Mm-hmm. That's good, isn't it?

26:50.299 --> 26:52.100
You wanna tell me your name now?

26:56.204 --> 26:57.204
Okay.

27:01.476 --> 27:02.476
I'm Jericho.

27:07.482 --> 27:08.482
Feeling better?

27:12.788 --> 27:14.490
We got a ways to go, boy.

27:41.349 --> 27:43.319
So what should I call you?

28:01.669 --> 28:04.372
You don't gotta
tell me if you don't want to.

28:11.713 --> 28:12.713
I'm Jericho.

28:14.950 --> 28:15.950
Can you say that?

28:21.455 --> 28:25.328
Why don't you play that,
that song of yours.

28:28.430 --> 28:31.200
That one you played
this morning.

28:51.353 --> 28:52.353
Yeah.

28:53.754 --> 28:55.390
That's kinda sweet.

28:59.994 --> 29:02.598
It's all comforting. It's sweet.

30:26.815 --> 30:27.815
We meet again.

30:28.950 --> 30:31.386
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.

30:31.419 --> 30:34.789
Padre, I was, I was
hoping I'd run into you.

30:36.357 --> 30:37.592
That's why I'm here.

30:37.626 --> 30:39.862
I'm here where the
good Lord wants me to be.

30:39.895 --> 30:42.498
I begin and end my
life in his service.

30:43.665 --> 30:44.665
Service?

30:46.335 --> 30:49.338
Yes, we must live to
serve someone or something.

30:49.370 --> 30:50.538
Who do you serve?

30:50.571 --> 30:53.608
Well, I served many
a horror in my day,

30:53.642 --> 30:56.679
but that's not a conversation
I'd wanna have with a priest.

30:57.779 --> 30:59.548
Service, Jericho?

30:59.580 --> 31:02.550
What you just described is a
carnal pleasure, not service.

31:04.618 --> 31:05.618
Who's your partner?

31:08.357 --> 31:10.292
That's a poor,
feeble-minded boy.

31:11.393 --> 31:12.828
Feeble-minded?

31:12.860 --> 31:14.530
His mind's broke somehow.

31:15.563 --> 31:17.732
Maybe he was just born wrong.

31:17.765 --> 31:20.868
There's nothing wrong
with any of God's children.

31:20.902 --> 31:23.606
Sleeping there, he looks
like a little angel.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.710
He might, I don't know
what an angel looks like.

31:29.077 --> 31:31.780
I do. I can see it from here.

31:31.812 --> 31:32.812
His pure heart.

31:33.982 --> 31:35.917
Children like this,
born that way,

31:35.951 --> 31:39.521
have a unique ability of
bringing out the best in people.

31:39.553 --> 31:40.955
How so?

31:40.989 --> 31:43.893
They require extra patience,
understanding, compassion.

31:45.527 --> 31:48.564
They can be the cure for the
selfishness in people's hearts.

31:49.897 --> 31:51.934
Anyone who would live in
service to a child of God,

31:51.966 --> 31:53.569
would live by the grace of God.

31:55.103 --> 31:57.807
That boy's mama wanted me
to put him in a cold grave.

32:02.610 --> 32:03.987
You know, I killed a
lot of men in my day,

32:04.011 --> 32:06.048
and I'm sure I'll see a
lotta of them in hell.

32:06.080 --> 32:10.452
But, when I looked in that
boy's eyes, I couldn't do it.

32:14.155 --> 32:15.857
Now I don't know
what to do with him,

32:16.925 --> 32:18.165
and that's why I'm here, padre.

32:18.193 --> 32:20.863
Mm, an act of compassion.

32:21.797 --> 32:23.464
Not something that
you would find written

32:23.498 --> 32:24.732
on that wanted poster.

32:24.765 --> 32:26.501
Well, it's my first time.

32:26.534 --> 32:29.003
So maybe the newspapers
haven't picked up on it yet.

32:30.172 --> 32:32.674
First act of
compassion is important.

32:32.706 --> 32:34.109
It's a step towards change.

32:35.210 --> 32:37.413
Padre, don't get carried away.

32:37.445 --> 32:39.615
I'm just looking for a
place to stash that boy.

32:43.819 --> 32:45.753
One of my parishioners
could be of help to you.

33:19.988 --> 33:21.957
Good day, ma'am.

33:24.091 --> 33:25.593
I'm uh, just wondering

33:26.761 --> 33:28.664
if you might've seen
this here feller.

33:29.865 --> 33:30.865
He's a wanted criminal.

33:32.133 --> 33:34.670
I have not. Are you the law?

33:38.507 --> 33:40.142
Mind if I take a
look in the house?

33:43.712 --> 33:46.181
I told you I haven't seen him.

33:46.213 --> 33:48.117
You don't question
me in my own home.

33:52.753 --> 33:53.753
You alone?

33:54.923 --> 33:55.923
What?

33:57.591 --> 33:59.461
Well, you sure are pretty.

34:01.029 --> 34:02.731
Not safe for a lady to be alone.

34:02.763 --> 34:04.867
Not with a wanted
killer on the loose.

34:04.899 --> 34:07.802
I haven't seen the
man you're looking for.

34:07.836 --> 34:09.705
And I think it's best if you go.

34:11.805 --> 34:15.477
I don't take kindly
to rudeness, ma'am.

34:18.178 --> 34:19.981
Please, go.

34:21.249 --> 34:22.785
There I was paying
you a compliment.

34:26.620 --> 34:29.290
But there is still
somethin' I want from ya.

34:29.323 --> 34:31.626
There's nothing for you here.

34:31.660 --> 34:33.662
Please leave. Now.

34:36.164 --> 34:39.834
You know, I've been hunting
this crazed killer for weeks.

34:40.901 --> 34:43.070
I bring criminals to justice.

34:43.104 --> 34:45.774
I make the world a safer place.

34:45.807 --> 34:48.544
I'm kind of a hero of sorts.

34:48.577 --> 34:50.745
And, I like you.

34:51.812 --> 34:53.314
I think you're real pretty.

34:53.347 --> 34:55.050
Oops, said that already.

34:56.251 --> 34:57.752
Guess I'm kinda nervous.

34:58.953 --> 35:00.222
No need to be.

35:00.254 --> 35:02.925
But, I do have
things to tend to so,

35:02.957 --> 35:04.559
it's best if you got goin' now.

35:06.727 --> 35:10.698
I like you. You know,
in a romantic way.

35:12.734 --> 35:14.069
Listen here.

35:14.102 --> 35:16.939
What if I was to make
it worth your while?

35:16.972 --> 35:17.972
What?

35:19.006 --> 35:21.909
Well, you know like
them girls in town.

35:21.943 --> 35:23.778
Them soiled doves at the saloon.

35:24.979 --> 35:26.115
I am no whore.

35:28.783 --> 35:31.620
Well, you sure
do speak like one.

35:32.988 --> 35:33.988
Dirty tongue.

35:35.156 --> 35:37.893
Bet you can do plenty
with that mouth.

35:37.926 --> 35:38.926
Bite.

35:39.894 --> 35:41.796
No need for them teeth, darling.

35:42.763 --> 35:47.102
The gentlemanly tone
you're gettin' is a gift.

35:47.135 --> 35:49.937
I could take you inside, pull
that dress over your head,

35:49.970 --> 35:52.640
and forget all
this fool talking.

35:54.075 --> 35:57.044
But I got me a good
standing with the marshal.

35:57.077 --> 36:00.982
Hence why I'm approaching
you with all this commerce.

36:02.651 --> 36:05.654
I'm offering you money, for
just a little of your time.

36:06.588 --> 36:08.624
You better turn around
and get outta here.

36:08.656 --> 36:09.959
My husband'll be home soon.

36:11.926 --> 36:14.063
Husband? You ain't
got no husband, do you?

36:15.696 --> 36:18.334
I do too. And he's
due back any moment now.

36:22.403 --> 36:24.839
Then where's your
wedding ring, married lady?

36:27.042 --> 36:28.844
I'll be your husband now.

36:32.379 --> 36:34.849
And tonight will
be our honeymoon.

36:36.051 --> 36:37.819
You dare touch
me, you'll be sorry.

36:38.919 --> 36:41.122
Mark my words.

36:42.923 --> 36:47.295
Damn. You are a 4th of
July firecracker, ain't ya?

36:48.497 --> 36:52.000
Well, if ya ain't keen on giving
me some of that good loving

36:52.033 --> 36:54.368
at least you can offer me
to touch them fine bosoms

36:54.401 --> 36:56.070
you're hiding there.

36:56.104 --> 36:57.306
I'll pay you cash.

36:58.906 --> 37:01.977
Make it, make opening
that blouse easier on ya.

37:02.010 --> 37:05.981
Yeah. I, I, I just wanna
see 'em and touch 'em.

37:06.013 --> 37:08.082
I won't touch nothing else.

37:08.115 --> 37:11.419
See? I'm being fair,
being reasonable.

37:13.254 --> 37:16.725
I'm startin' to understand.

37:16.758 --> 37:17.959
Forgive me.

37:17.992 --> 37:20.227
I can see that you're
trying to be reasonable.

37:20.260 --> 37:23.698
And, my body is
indeed beautiful.

37:25.265 --> 37:27.903
The desire in you
shouldn't be denied.

37:27.935 --> 37:29.071
Now you're talking.

37:29.104 --> 37:30.872
It's just that...

37:30.905 --> 37:31.905
What's that?

37:32.473 --> 37:33.473
Your gun.

37:35.075 --> 37:37.244
It would be difficult
to show you my body

37:37.278 --> 37:39.247
with that gun in your hand.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.015
Guns make me nervous.

37:46.086 --> 37:48.122
I'll be honest with you.

37:48.156 --> 37:52.795
I do need the money, and you
aren't asking for too much.

37:54.095 --> 37:56.031
You're also right.

37:56.064 --> 37:57.732
I am alone.

37:57.765 --> 38:00.167
Secretly, I tell you, sir,

38:00.200 --> 38:04.839
how I yearn for the touch
of a strong man like you.

38:05.874 --> 38:09.144
If you would be kind enough
to remove your gun altogether,

38:09.176 --> 38:13.749
I may be moved to
allow you to kiss them.

38:16.885 --> 38:17.885
Kiss, you say?

38:19.354 --> 38:21.356
As your pleasure commands.

38:22.524 --> 38:24.727
After all, they're very sweet.

38:29.531 --> 38:33.969
Such a gift is your
kindness and understanding.

38:35.068 --> 38:37.037
You should be rewarded.

38:40.975 --> 38:43.944
I gave you the opportunity
to leave in peace,

38:43.977 --> 38:46.046
but you chose to stay and die.

38:54.122 --> 38:57.125
My pecker's more
fearsome than that, sister.

38:58.091 --> 39:00.328
Oh, bitch, you done shot me.

39:01.930 --> 39:04.132
Oh, it didn't even go through.

39:04.164 --> 39:06.033
Damn, I think you cracked a rib.

39:47.941 --> 39:49.043
You wait right here.

39:59.120 --> 40:02.357
What is the problem with
you women folk now-a-days?

40:02.390 --> 40:04.059
Goddammit.

40:04.091 --> 40:06.294
Yeah, here I am talking
to you all romantic-like.

40:08.229 --> 40:10.531
And gentlemanly, and...

40:11.932 --> 40:13.167
There, dammit.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.935
- The choice is yours, sugar.
- No!

40:14.968 --> 40:19.073
Yeah, you can live, and
let me do my business.

40:19.106 --> 40:21.208
Or, I can just shoot
you in the head.

40:22.510 --> 40:24.946
Then I'll have my way
with your pretty self.

40:24.979 --> 40:26.615
You'll be warm just
long enough for me

40:26.647 --> 40:28.182
to do what needs doing.

40:29.249 --> 40:32.152
Trust me. I got me experience.

40:36.691 --> 40:38.359
Ain't you that son of a whore,

40:39.560 --> 40:42.097
tried to shoot me in
the back week's past?

40:42.964 --> 40:45.901
Now, Jericho, thems
was just warning shots.

40:48.568 --> 40:51.005
I wasn't trying to
hit you or anything.

40:51.039 --> 40:55.542
You hit my horse. That
horse and I came a long way.

40:55.575 --> 40:57.278
I oughta kill you just for that.

40:58.946 --> 41:02.117
Well, you stole my horse
after that little exchange.

41:02.149 --> 41:04.452
I guess that makes us even.

41:04.484 --> 41:06.655
Your horse ran off yesterday.

41:06.687 --> 41:08.390
That horse wasn't worth a shit.

41:09.589 --> 41:13.260
Yeah? Well, maybe
that serves you right.

41:13.294 --> 41:16.698
Also, I got a question for ya.

41:16.731 --> 41:19.066
Is that how you
killed all those men?

41:19.100 --> 41:21.136
Sneaking up on 'em from behind?

41:21.169 --> 41:23.203
You afraid to draw on a man?

41:23.236 --> 41:25.205
Look a man in his eye?

41:25.238 --> 41:27.141
You want me to
give you a show down?

41:28.176 --> 41:29.344
Release that girl.

41:30.377 --> 41:31.377
Why?

41:32.647 --> 41:35.216
'Cause If you don't, I'll
drop you where you stand.

41:48.763 --> 41:49.763
Ma'am.

41:53.633 --> 41:55.937
I left a young boy
at your front door.

41:58.406 --> 42:00.242
Now, if this is my hour,

42:01.209 --> 42:03.211
I want your word that
you'll raise him up

42:03.243 --> 42:04.512
till he can stand on his own.

42:08.182 --> 42:11.986
You have my word. But,
I ask one thing of you.

42:13.254 --> 42:14.389
Kill this bastard good.

42:17.091 --> 42:18.193
Shoot him in the balls.

42:20.294 --> 42:22.196
I like a girl
with a dirty mouth.

42:23.363 --> 42:25.566
Rest assured ma'am.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.069
Looking to make this
a fair fight, Jericho.

42:29.269 --> 42:31.138
I'm just waiting
for her to clear.

42:50.425 --> 42:52.260
That's for my horse.

42:56.296 --> 42:57.664
And this is for the girl.

43:13.180 --> 43:16.383
You say that the
priest sent you?

43:16.417 --> 43:18.386
Yes ma'am, he did.

43:18.419 --> 43:21.256
Divine intervention.
My thanks to you.

43:23.390 --> 43:27.461
Uh, by any chance you have
uh, any food for the boy here?

43:27.495 --> 43:29.064
Is he your son?

43:29.097 --> 43:30.799
No, just uh, I was
taking care of him

43:30.832 --> 43:32.767
until I could find him a place.

43:32.800 --> 43:34.301
I see.

43:34.334 --> 43:36.403
Well, I don't have much food,

43:36.437 --> 43:38.607
but what's here,
you're welcome to it.

43:40.207 --> 43:41.417
I tell you what, why
don't you fix up somethin'

43:41.441 --> 43:43.610
for you and the boy,
and I'll head out

43:43.644 --> 43:46.814
and see if I can't shoot a
couple of varmints for the table.

43:46.847 --> 43:49.183
That's very kind of you.

43:49.216 --> 43:53.521
In exchange, I insist
you stay for the night.

43:57.691 --> 44:00.427
If you have a spare
blanket, I'll camp out front,

44:00.461 --> 44:03.131
and the boy will
stay here with you.

44:03.164 --> 44:04.164
Agreed.

45:27.347 --> 45:28.415
It's Jericho.

45:33.453 --> 45:35.589
You ever fix something with fox?

45:35.622 --> 45:37.258
Fox?

45:37.290 --> 45:41.428
Oh, I bet he's the one that's
been killing my chickens.

45:41.461 --> 45:43.197
Thank you.

45:43.231 --> 45:45.767
Well, I'm glad to be of service.

45:49.403 --> 45:50.738
Service?

45:50.771 --> 45:53.575
You've been that
and more. Bless you.

45:54.441 --> 45:56.410
Save your blessings
for that boy.

45:57.611 --> 46:01.415
Slumbering there, is he?

46:01.448 --> 46:04.418
He is. A full
belly'll do that to you.

46:05.519 --> 46:06.519
Yes, it will.

46:09.557 --> 46:11.759
You're the first
killer I ever heard of

46:11.792 --> 46:13.194
caring for a child.

46:14.394 --> 46:15.394
Pardon me?

46:16.296 --> 46:19.367
That miserable wretch of
a bounty hunter you shot?

46:19.399 --> 46:21.301
He was looking for you.

46:21.334 --> 46:24.304
Said you were a killer.

46:24.338 --> 46:25.707
Showed me your wanted poster.

46:27.607 --> 46:32.247
But I see you now, caring
for this innocent child.

46:38.419 --> 46:42.390
Why is the law after
you? If I may ask.

46:44.691 --> 46:48.662
Well ma'am, after the war,

46:49.830 --> 46:52.567
some men hired me
to clear the way

46:52.600 --> 46:54.336
for them to lay their railroad.

46:55.403 --> 46:58.006
Now there's some other men
who wanna hang me for it.

47:02.376 --> 47:04.778
I guess I never really found
my place in this world.

47:07.448 --> 47:11.319
Well, you've allowed
me to keep my virtue.

47:12.319 --> 47:14.888
Impressed me with your
kindness to the child.

47:16.524 --> 47:19.627
You've even apprehended the
fox that ate my chickens.

47:19.660 --> 47:22.763
So far, your presence
in my world is welcome.

47:24.531 --> 47:29.504
This day, you've turned a
once sorry house into a home.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.608
Ma'am...

47:34.642 --> 47:36.377
Please, my name is Charlotte.

47:40.381 --> 47:43.350
Charlotte them
might be the kindest words

47:43.383 --> 47:44.952
that's ever been spoke to me.

48:12.747 --> 48:13.748
There we go.

48:16.751 --> 48:17.752
Thank you.

48:21.622 --> 48:24.125
Oh, he likes to have his
arm rubbed like this.

48:44.879 --> 48:46.581
Ready to tell me your name now?

48:49.950 --> 48:50.950
Come on.

48:52.118 --> 48:53.118
Talk to me.

48:57.057 --> 48:58.057
I'm Jericho.

49:00.693 --> 49:01.693
That's Charlotte.

49:05.633 --> 49:06.768
And your name is?

49:11.539 --> 49:12.774
Come on, boy.

49:34.028 --> 49:35.629
I know he's in there somewhere.

49:39.466 --> 49:42.002
He just can't seem
to tell his tale yet.

49:42.035 --> 49:44.938
One thing he might
need is stability.

49:46.073 --> 49:47.073
A home.

49:48.075 --> 49:49.577
You could leave him here.

49:49.609 --> 49:51.613
Just till you get
clear of your trouble.

49:56.249 --> 50:00.120
Charlotte, I may never
be clear of my troubles.

50:01.488 --> 50:03.757
Then, maybe you should stay too.

50:05.825 --> 50:06.660
Stay?

50:06.693 --> 50:07.693
Permanently.

50:08.662 --> 50:09.797
Forgive me.

50:09.830 --> 50:12.066
My mouth sometimes
gets me into trouble.

50:12.098 --> 50:15.569
But, I feel, I
must speak my mind.

50:15.602 --> 50:19.473
And yes, you should
consider living here.

50:23.910 --> 50:24.711
Like?

50:24.745 --> 50:25.745
Like a family.

50:31.151 --> 50:33.687
What would be my
part in this family?

50:39.026 --> 50:40.026
The husband?

50:50.638 --> 50:54.742
Charlotte, you're a
beautiful young woman.

50:56.176 --> 50:59.981
You're like a, like a
flower in this wilderness.

51:00.948 --> 51:04.786
And you're too smart to
waste your life on a,

51:05.752 --> 51:06.888
on an old dog like me.

51:08.222 --> 51:10.658
I'm no such flower,
as I may appear.

51:12.091 --> 51:13.160
I've got a past.

51:15.963 --> 51:20.834
We all have a past. It's
best to leave it behind us.

51:22.769 --> 51:26.073
My past I'm afraid, follows me.

51:27.274 --> 51:28.274
I'm

51:30.276 --> 51:31.878
barren.

51:31.912 --> 51:33.548
I can't have kids.

51:35.182 --> 51:37.752
Not the kind of prize most
men would want to win.

51:40.053 --> 51:44.658
Only a fool wouldn't
see you for what you are.

51:45.926 --> 51:46.926
And that is?

51:49.897 --> 51:51.065
You're a fine lady.

51:52.231 --> 51:53.567
I'd give my oath on it.

51:58.205 --> 52:01.842
And as far as I can reckon, not
being able to bear children,

52:01.874 --> 52:03.777
well that, that ain't no sin.

52:18.926 --> 52:19.994
It's our mutual friend.

52:21.095 --> 52:22.696
Father Ramirez, come in.

52:24.365 --> 52:25.365
Have a seat.

52:26.767 --> 52:28.602
So that's your name.

52:28.635 --> 52:30.604
Father Elijah Ramirez.

52:30.638 --> 52:31.638
Elijah, huh?

52:33.339 --> 52:34.908
Well that makes sense.

52:34.941 --> 52:36.977
You being a priest and all.

52:37.010 --> 52:38.745
How's that?

52:38.778 --> 52:41.715
Well, Elijah's one
of those prophets

52:41.749 --> 52:43.251
from the uh Bible, isn't he?

52:45.118 --> 52:46.821
Revelation, indeed.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.055
You know your Bible.

52:49.089 --> 52:53.127
Caring for a child, keeping
company with a priest.

52:53.160 --> 52:55.930
You're like no killer
I've ever heard of.

52:55.963 --> 52:57.330
But, I'll let you
boys get to it.

52:57.363 --> 52:58.832
I've got things to tend to.

53:05.071 --> 53:07.008
Is your first act of compassion

53:07.040 --> 53:09.776
branching off into
better prospects?

53:09.810 --> 53:12.113
Well how do you mean, padre?

53:13.714 --> 53:16.184
If you live a life in
service to her, to the boy,

53:17.818 --> 53:20.053
you'll no longer be a ship
in sea without a rudder.

53:23.890 --> 53:26.394
You'll have direction, purpose.

53:27.060 --> 53:28.863
And you'll learn that wickedness

53:28.896 --> 53:30.865
has nothing to
offer in comparison.

53:32.198 --> 53:33.934
Padre, I've got guns
that are chasing me

53:33.966 --> 53:38.204
that will not quit until I'm
dead, dead in their wake.

53:38.238 --> 53:40.774
A difficult situation to be in.

53:40.807 --> 53:43.010
A new life within arms' reach,

53:43.042 --> 53:45.412
while your old life is
biting at your heels.

53:47.247 --> 53:48.883
You want to change, Jericho?

53:50.417 --> 53:52.053
You want to live
a peaceful life?

53:54.988 --> 53:55.988
Answer me.

53:56.823 --> 53:59.426
Only a damn fool would
say no to such a thing.

54:07.167 --> 54:09.904
From now on, repent.

54:11.037 --> 54:12.037
Atone.

54:14.107 --> 54:15.910
Ask forgiveness for
what you've done.

54:17.745 --> 54:18.913
And no more killings.

54:21.281 --> 54:23.985
As man of this house, I
will have to defend them.

54:25.084 --> 54:28.188
Defend, but don't murder.

54:29.890 --> 54:32.859
Thus you must dedicate your
life to providing for the boy,

54:34.127 --> 54:35.863
protecting him before yourself.

54:39.232 --> 54:40.232
That's it?

54:41.535 --> 54:44.305
And church on
Sunday, every Sunday.

54:45.405 --> 54:46.973
And you must accompany
me once a week

54:47.006 --> 54:48.309
with my missionary work.

54:50.910 --> 54:54.147
And if you're lucky,
that lovely young woman

54:55.314 --> 54:56.950
will let you be
part of her life.

54:59.185 --> 55:00.187
She needs a husband.

55:01.921 --> 55:03.023
The boy needs a father.

55:08.127 --> 55:09.127
And you need a home.

55:11.131 --> 55:13.334
Okay, padre. How do we do this?

55:17.470 --> 55:19.272
We'll go to town
to see the judge.

55:20.473 --> 55:23.042
And I'll explain to him that
you're gonna dedicate your life

55:23.075 --> 55:25.078
to the family and the church.

55:25.111 --> 55:27.180
And that you'll be
under my supervision.

55:56.142 --> 55:57.343
Wait here.

55:57.377 --> 55:59.013
Best that I talk to
the judge myself.

56:14.160 --> 56:15.160
Jericho?

56:16.229 --> 56:19.833
Well I'll be
goddamned. It is you.

56:19.867 --> 56:22.236
I heard it told you were
shot dead two winters back

56:22.269 --> 56:25.071
by a posse that ambushed you.

56:25.104 --> 56:26.549
They ambushed me all
right, but I buried 'em

56:26.573 --> 56:29.143
and left 'em up
on that mountain.

56:29.176 --> 56:31.345
I hoped against
reason that I might by chance

56:31.377 --> 56:33.146
cross your way.

56:33.180 --> 56:34.548
Why is that?

56:34.580 --> 56:37.285
I got work to suit ya.
Paying cash money, big money.

56:39.218 --> 56:41.187
I got the law on
my heels, Wopat.

56:41.220 --> 56:43.156
Not the law in my territory.

56:43.189 --> 56:46.626
Even if they did know about
you all the way out there,

56:46.660 --> 56:49.129
I'm in good favor
with the sheriff.

56:49.162 --> 56:52.066
Few dollars across his
desk, he'll pay you no mind.

56:53.332 --> 56:54.535
What would I be doing?

56:56.470 --> 56:58.906
What else would I need you for?

56:58.939 --> 57:01.508
I need the fastest
damn gun I ever seen.

57:01.540 --> 57:04.178
I got some filthy
savages need killin'.

57:04.211 --> 57:05.913
They don't like
my railroad tracks

57:05.946 --> 57:09.216
running across their sacred
earth, or some such horse shit.

57:09.249 --> 57:12.486
Anyhow, I got an empty room
waiting for you at the brothel,

57:12.519 --> 57:15.890
with plenty of fine, sportin'
women, like Delilah here.

57:19.660 --> 57:24.231
Wopat, you're offering everything
a man could want after.

57:24.263 --> 57:26.099
And whiskey, plenty of whiskey.

57:26.133 --> 57:29.236
So come on, carry your happy
ass up on the train with me

57:29.269 --> 57:30.537
before the damn law sees ya.

57:34.207 --> 57:35.276
Wait, wait.

57:37.443 --> 57:38.443
What's wrong?

57:41.314 --> 57:45.285
Wopat, I can't go
with you this time.

57:46.486 --> 57:48.022
I'm hanging up my guns.

57:48.988 --> 57:50.357
No more killing for me, friend.

57:53.093 --> 57:55.263
I gave my word to
someone to, to...

57:57.564 --> 57:59.600
What? To some woman?

57:59.633 --> 58:01.001
No.

58:01.033 --> 58:02.135
Well then who, goddammit?

58:05.671 --> 58:08.074
God. I found God.

58:11.243 --> 58:15.182
Well, best of luck to ya.

58:45.044 --> 58:46.479
Judge ain't big on redemption?

58:46.513 --> 58:48.115
Sadly, you're correct.

58:48.147 --> 58:50.084
Make haste. He just
wouldn't listen to me.

58:50.117 --> 58:52.086
I told him that you'd
be in my custody.

58:53.053 --> 58:55.556
I got too much blood
on my hands, padre.

58:55.589 --> 58:57.324
Don't fret, I'll prevail.

59:08.200 --> 59:10.536
In the name of
the Lord, hear me.

59:13.140 --> 59:14.341
Let, let, let me...

59:14.374 --> 59:16.174
You ain't taking a
bullet meant for me, padre.

59:18.678 --> 59:19.480
Stay here.

59:19.513 --> 59:22.216
Wait.

59:22.249 --> 59:24.350
Please, all of you, don't shoot.

1:00:00.287 --> 1:00:02.356
There's more men behind you.

1:00:39.392 --> 1:00:41.227
Wait, please, don't shoot.

1:00:41.894 --> 1:00:43.362
Don't shoot.

1:00:46.265 --> 1:00:48.635
Don't shoot. Please, come back.

1:03:37.303 --> 1:03:40.840
I gave my word, I would
only use my gun in defense.

1:03:44.343 --> 1:03:46.780
Now you go your
way, and I'll go.

1:03:49.015 --> 1:03:50.484
And we'll walk away in peace.

1:04:07.334 --> 1:04:10.569
Hey padre, looks like you
almost met your maker there.

1:04:10.602 --> 1:04:11.602
My friend.

1:04:12.372 --> 1:04:13.982
Sure you still wanna
wager that life of yours

1:04:14.006 --> 1:04:16.510
on seeing this
thing through, huh?

1:04:16.542 --> 1:04:17.542
Yes.

1:04:19.511 --> 1:04:22.316
All these men died
because of me.

1:04:23.850 --> 1:04:27.521
No. They died because they
didn't listen to you, padre.

1:04:30.990 --> 1:04:32.593
My father, he was a good man.

1:04:35.127 --> 1:04:37.631
Sadly, he let despair take him

1:04:37.664 --> 1:04:39.466
when hard times
struck our family.

1:04:40.667 --> 1:04:42.803
In desperation, he
turned into wickedness.

1:04:46.705 --> 1:04:47.673
I would have done
anything to show him

1:04:47.707 --> 1:04:49.410
that all was not forsaken.

1:04:50.609 --> 1:04:55.015
At the time I, I did know how.

1:04:55.048 --> 1:04:56.950
Not until I gave my
life to the Lord.

1:04:58.718 --> 1:05:01.488
His words, his mercy.

1:05:04.457 --> 1:05:06.560
By the time I was
blessed with this wisdom,

1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:09.362
my father had gone to his grave.

1:05:11.597 --> 1:05:12.597
I couldn't save him.

1:05:14.133 --> 1:05:16.702
Well padre, you, you saved me

1:05:16.736 --> 1:05:18.972
from falling in an early grave.

1:05:19.004 --> 1:05:22.376
You see now why you must
keep your promise to me.

1:05:22.408 --> 1:05:24.877
Well, I reckon if, if I don't,

1:05:24.910 --> 1:05:27.647
you'll always be here to
keep me noddin' straight.

1:05:29.915 --> 1:05:33.486
I'm afraid not.

1:05:33.519 --> 1:05:34.854
Padre, you've been shot.

1:05:34.888 --> 1:05:36.490
Promise me that
you'll stay true.

1:05:36.522 --> 1:05:37.857
After I get you to the doctor.

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:38.959
No, Jericho.

1:05:40.126 --> 1:05:42.629
I'm where the good
Lord wants me to be.

1:05:42.662 --> 1:05:46.600
I begin and end my life
in, in his service.

1:06:56.935 --> 1:06:57.935
Elijah.

1:07:03.743 --> 1:07:05.078
Can I name you Elijah?

1:07:09.749 --> 1:07:10.749
I'm Jericho.

1:07:12.151 --> 1:07:13.151
You're Elijah.

1:07:15.555 --> 1:07:16.555
What's my name?

1:07:20.727 --> 1:07:22.062
Papa.

1:08:01.901 --> 1:08:03.136
Bo.

1:08:03.169 --> 1:08:04.169
Charlotte.

1:08:05.271 --> 1:08:06.272
It's been a while.

1:08:07.874 --> 1:08:09.809
It's been a few years.

1:08:09.841 --> 1:08:13.312
How's your wife? Your family?

1:08:13.345 --> 1:08:15.748
Well, it all hasn't
went how I hoped.

1:08:17.350 --> 1:08:18.350
Oh.

1:08:19.351 --> 1:08:22.055
Yeah. Turns out you and
her have a similar condition.

1:08:23.855 --> 1:08:24.855
Condition?

1:08:26.092 --> 1:08:28.929
Yep. Can't make no babies.

1:08:31.663 --> 1:08:33.766
I'm sorry to hear it.

1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:37.169
She was after all
a, a whole woman.

1:08:38.971 --> 1:08:39.971
Maybe she still is.

1:08:43.743 --> 1:08:44.743
What do you mean?

1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:50.551
Turns out I'm pregnant.

1:08:54.052 --> 1:08:55.622
With my second.

1:08:57.890 --> 1:08:59.126
Oh, here comes my first.

1:09:03.262 --> 1:09:07.167
Mama, mama. Papa's been
looking all over for you.

1:09:07.199 --> 1:09:08.199
Oh, okay.

1:09:14.106 --> 1:09:16.243
Well, congratulations.

1:09:19.878 --> 1:09:21.814
Good day to you, Miss Charlotte.

1:09:21.847 --> 1:09:23.082
Mrs. Charlotte.

1:09:28.387 --> 1:09:30.656
I'll pray for you.

1:09:53.145 --> 1:09:54.145
What?

1:09:55.181 --> 1:09:57.083
We have so much
wood at the house.

1:09:57.115 --> 1:09:59.819
Why are you cutting more?

1:09:59.851 --> 1:10:00.851
For the church.

1:10:01.854 --> 1:10:04.324
You are so devout.
Are you thirsty?

1:10:06.359 --> 1:10:09.863
Darling, I am
thirsty for your kiss.

1:10:13.766 --> 1:10:15.068
What?

1:10:15.101 --> 1:10:17.270
I'd better get back to the kids.

1:10:17.302 --> 1:10:19.205
Do not let your supper spoil.

1:10:20.239 --> 1:10:21.908
I will not, ma'am.

1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:24.877
And, don't waste
all your strength.

1:10:25.878 --> 1:10:27.147
You might need it later.

1:10:30.115 --> 1:10:31.417
I love that dirty talk.

1:11:04.283 --> 1:11:05.919
Legend in the flesh.

1:11:08.221 --> 1:11:10.991
Figured it'd be harder sneaking
up on the likes of you.

1:11:12.124 --> 1:11:13.124
No sir.

1:11:15.293 --> 1:11:16.293
Who might you be?

1:11:17.497 --> 1:11:19.700
Who I am makes no nevermind.

1:11:22.334 --> 1:11:24.370
Maybe you shot and
killed my brother,

1:11:26.138 --> 1:11:27.239
or my father.

1:11:30.776 --> 1:11:31.811
None of that matters.

1:11:34.113 --> 1:11:36.415
All that matters is I'm
challenging you to a duel.

1:11:38.150 --> 1:11:40.153
Gun against gun.

1:11:41.988 --> 1:11:43.289
I see that look in your eye.

1:11:44.390 --> 1:11:45.792
I had that look too.

1:11:47.325 --> 1:11:49.895
Then I changed. I
learned a new way.

1:11:51.096 --> 1:11:52.965
A way without killing,
a way of peace.

1:11:54.167 --> 1:11:55.435
And I could show you.

1:11:55.467 --> 1:11:57.770
I came here to kill ya,
not take no preaching.

1:12:01.940 --> 1:12:06.178
Besides, I believe there
ain't nothing changed in ya.

1:12:08.847 --> 1:12:10.283
Sounds like you're a liar.

1:12:11.984 --> 1:12:13.986
Looking to talk your
way outta this fight.

1:12:17.589 --> 1:12:18.589
You're too slow.

1:12:20.159 --> 1:12:22.996
But you're lucky, I wasn't
lying about having changed.

1:12:26.231 --> 1:12:28.033
What're you doin'?

1:12:28.066 --> 1:12:29.301
I'm just keeping a promise.

1:12:31.102 --> 1:12:35.908
And all I ask in exchange
is you allow me to explain.

1:12:35.941 --> 1:12:36.941
You're crazy.

1:12:38.144 --> 1:12:39.546
You're staring at a killer.

1:12:39.579 --> 1:12:43.884
If you allow me to
explain how I was helped,

1:12:45.184 --> 1:12:46.285
maybe I can help you.

1:12:51.223 --> 1:12:52.559
You look thirsty, friend.

1:12:56.061 --> 1:12:59.131
Can I offer you
a drink of water?
