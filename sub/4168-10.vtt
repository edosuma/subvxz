I REPEAT ‐‐
MOJADOS IN SECTOR FIVE.

25:29.197 --> 25:30.999
YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES

25:31.032 --> 25:34.102
BEFORE THE BORDER PATROL
GETS HERE, WILSON.

25:34.135 --> 25:36.371
I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE
AGAIN.

25:37.739 --> 25:38.973
THANK YOU.

25:39.007 --> 25:40.341
THANK YOU.

25:40.375 --> 25:40.975
WAIT.

25:41.009 --> 25:42.944
GIVE ME ONE...

25:42.977 --> 25:44.712
JUST SO MY DAY'S NOT
A TOTAL LOSS.

25:44.746 --> 25:48.049
"GIVE YOU ONE"?
THESE ARE PEOPLE.

25:48.082 --> 25:49.484
LET'S JUST GIVE HIM THE GUY
WHO HUGGED ME.

25:49.517 --> 25:50.518
HE'S ANNOYING.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.122
YO, HOMBRE.
RáPIDO. LET'S GO.

25:54.155 --> 25:56.291
YOU, COME ON.
LET'S GO. OUT.

26:02.897 --> 26:04.699
NOW GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE.

26:04.732 --> 26:06.167
[ LAUGHS ]

26:06.201 --> 26:07.969
LET'S GO, ANDY, COME ON.

26:16.778 --> 26:18.346
Andy.
MM‐HMM?

26:18.379 --> 26:21.049
YOU WANT TO TAKE A WALK
OR SOMETHING?

26:21.082 --> 26:23.284
COME ON.
MM‐HMM.

26:23.318 --> 26:25.019
COME ON.

26:27.488 --> 26:29.357
SURE, WHY NOT?

26:34.162 --> 26:37.432
I'M A FUCKING LIAR.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.067
I WAS A BAD COYOTE.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.402
I LIE TO MYSELF
ALL THE TIME.

26:41.436 --> 26:43.271
I LET DOUG SACRIFICE
ONE OF MY PEOPLE.

26:43.304 --> 26:44.706
HE DID IT FOR LOVE,
BUT...

26:44.739 --> 26:47.408
I NEGOTIATE THINGS
THAT SHOULDN'T BE UP FOR DEBATE.

26:47.442 --> 26:50.111
I MAKE LITTLE COMPROMISES
WITH MYSELF.

26:50.144 --> 26:52.280
AND WHY DON'T I HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

26:52.313 --> 26:55.283
I TELL MYSELF I'M NOT DOING HARM
WHEN I AM.

26:55.316 --> 26:57.085
I SO AM!

26:57.118 --> 26:59.120
I WANT A GIRLFRIEND.

26:59.153 --> 27:01.322
I MEAN, I'M A GOOD GUY.

27:01.356 --> 27:03.124
I'M CUTE.

27:03.157 --> 27:06.027
AM I TOO OLD
FOR A GIRLFRIEND?

27:06.060 --> 27:08.563
NANCY, HAS MY WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY CLOSED?

27:08.596 --> 27:11.466
IS MY WINDOW SHUT, NANCE?

27:11.499 --> 27:13.735
HOW DID YOU OPEN
YOUR OWN WINDOW?

27:13.768 --> 27:14.702
DO YOU SEE HER?

27:14.736 --> 27:16.471
WHO?

27:16.504 --> 27:17.772
THERE.

27:17.805 --> 27:20.542
DO YOU SEE HER?

27:20.575 --> 27:23.311
SEE ‐‐ SEE ‐‐
SEE WHO?

27:23.344 --> 27:24.279
THERE!

27:26.581 --> 27:29.417
THERE'S NO ONE THERE.

27:32.353 --> 27:33.588
OH.

27:33.621 --> 27:35.256
RIGHT.

27:37.592 --> 27:39.627
OF COURSE NOT.
