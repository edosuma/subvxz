with postpartum depression

03:13.527 --> 03:15.561
I first saw Dr. Jenn
a few years ago

03:15.563 --> 03:17.829
when I was at a really low
point in life,

03:17.831 --> 03:20.332

of relationship

that could happen

03:39.486 --> 03:42.487

I fell in love
with my friend.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.267
My--
With Cynthia.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.702
She was exactly
what I needed.

03:56.704 --> 04:00.038
In what way?
Support.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.975
She was my everything.
Yeah.

04:02.977 --> 04:05.344
And... then she got pregnant.

04:05.346 --> 04:10.415
And I was super-excited
because, you know...

04:10.417 --> 04:12.718

she felt that, right?

04:27.768 --> 04:29.901
Yeah.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.804
25...

04:32.806 --> 04:34.773
You know, you worried
about stability.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.509
You worried
about everything.
Yeah.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.045
And, doc, that's when
it got a little nuts.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.481
Yeah.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.850
She was real moody.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.351
During the pregnancy.
Which is--

04:46.353 --> 04:50.555
Yeah.
Combined with my career
began to really accelerate.

04:50.557 --> 04:53.058
Yeah.
So she was alone.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.227
Were you guys
having conflict?
A lot of conflict.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.728
Were you fighting?
A lot of conflict.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.530
And I guess the part
that's (bleep) me up, doc,

04:58.532 --> 05:02.367
is she didn't show
these... qualities

05:02.369 --> 05:04.636
that seem to be
manifesting today.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.039
Is she open
to meeting me?

05:07.041 --> 05:10.075
Yeah, let me try
to find her.
Okay.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.477

some clarity.

Tell me a little more.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.581
It's hard.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.683
I guess one
of the things is...

05:51.685 --> 05:53.919
I'm dealing with
postpartum depression.

05:53.921 --> 05:58.457
And he is very busy
with work.
Mm-hmm.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.493
It's not just Joe.
It's like I feel stuck.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.628
Being a young mom,
I don't wanna feel like

06:03.630 --> 06:05.997
it's impeding my life,
you know.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.700
And his fix is like,
"Get a nanny."

06:08.702 --> 06:10.168
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.436
And I don't want a nanny.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.472
My mom, she was
a single mom.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.441
She was working
20 hours a day.
Yeah.

06:16.443 --> 06:20.612
And she would leave me
with people she'd think
she could trust, and...

06:20.614 --> 06:24.015
And did bad things happen
with people that she
thought she could trust?

06:24.017 --> 06:27.819
1,000%.
Yeah.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.921
Can I ask
what happened?

06:33.827 --> 06:37.229
I never really
said this before.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.430
I had a feeling.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.133
I think, like, three people
in this life know.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.402
Including Joe.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.537
My mom doesn't even know.

06:47.608 --> 06:52.043
You know, the things
that we don't
talk about like that,

06:52.045 --> 06:54.546
we tend to carry
a lot of shame,

06:54.548 --> 06:57.282
and that shame
eats us up.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.951
And what tends to
happen is that...

06:59.953 --> 07:03.388
we take those experiences
and we carry them with us,

07:03.390 --> 07:07.192
which makes you
still a victim
to whoever hurt you.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.998
(exhales)

07:13.000 --> 07:15.133
So, when I was five,

07:15.135 --> 07:17.903
I was raped.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.205
But I was raped by a woman.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.241
(Cyn sobbing)

07:25.846 --> 07:29.581
What happened
was not your fault.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.116
Ohh.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.818
Do you get that?

07:32.820 --> 07:34.753
I do.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.558
But I don't trust
because of that.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.427
I don't even let anybody
change my baby's diaper.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.929
I understand.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.931
(voice breaking)
I don't trust anybody.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.100
I don't know if this is
postpartum depression.

07:49.102 --> 07:53.738
I think what this may be is
all the unresolved feelings

07:53.740 --> 07:56.508
about the trauma
you suffered

07:56.510 --> 07:57.943
bubbling to the surface.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.512
It's... coming out
in depression.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.047
It's coming out in anxiety,

08:02.049 --> 08:05.116
which also makes you feel
angry and resentful.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.552
And you have a baby
that you can't
accept help with.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.321
Like...
Mm-hmm, yeah.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.123
It's the perfect storm.
Right, literally.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.758
You see, right?
Yeah.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.627
You just-- That's exactly
how it is for me.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.263
Yeah.
So then I start to
feel resentment towards him

08:18.265 --> 08:20.131
because I don't feel
like he's doing
everything to help me,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.934
and I feel like that's
his responsibility
as my partner.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.404
Why don't we bring him
in here and let's talk
the two of you together.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.707
(Cyn)
The assessment
that Dr. Jenn made

08:28.709 --> 08:30.375
made all the sense
in the world.

08:30.377 --> 08:33.478
It feels good being able
to open up to a professional,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.347
especially someone
who is a woman

08:35.349 --> 08:38.250
and someone who has had kids
and I'm not being judged.

08:38.252 --> 08:40.652
One of the things that
Cynthia shared with me

08:40.654 --> 08:43.121
that I think really
impacts your relationship

08:43.123 --> 08:46.291
is that she was very open
and willing to talk about

08:46.293 --> 08:49.928
that when she was
five years old
that she was molested,

08:49.930 --> 08:52.297
so that has made it
very hard for her

08:52.299 --> 08:55.567
to trust anyone
taking care of the baby,

08:55.569 --> 08:58.637
which makes it
very difficult
for the two of you

08:58.639 --> 09:00.906
to have any time
alone together.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.808
You guys clearly
love each other.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.710
And you actually both
want the same thing.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.413
We both want
the same things, but...

09:11.118 --> 09:13.585
Like, I hope
that's enough.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.854
It's not enough

09:15.856 --> 09:18.857
without the tools
and without the willingness

09:18.859 --> 09:21.293
to do the hard work.

09:21.295 --> 09:24.496
For you to be willing
to explore this pain

09:24.498 --> 09:25.630
and this trauma
you went through.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.966
You gotta do
individual therapy.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.969
For you to be
willing to

09:30.971 --> 09:34.806
instead of getting annoyed
and pissed off at her,

09:34.808 --> 09:39.544
let's come from the approach
of "Baby, I'm so sorry
this thing happened to you.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.781
I know it's gotta be
so hard to trust again."

09:42.783 --> 09:44.950
And then when she's ready

09:44.952 --> 09:48.219
to have an extensive
screening process

09:48.221 --> 09:51.723
when it comes to having
someone come and help out

09:51.725 --> 09:54.092
so that you can guys
can have a little freedom

09:54.094 --> 09:56.828
to actually tend
to your relationship

09:56.830 --> 09:58.330
and how important that is.

09:58.332 --> 09:59.831
Very much so.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.434
But this is
a really good start.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.606
(Judy)
You should've took a lot more
time to get to know this child,

10:07.608 --> 10:09.007

around my grandchildren.

Yep.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.746

I have a class coming up--

12:27.748 --> 12:29.848

Since Nya's been so
charitable with her services,

12:34.187 --> 12:36.888
I might as well invite Sidney
to my makeup class and teach her

12:36.890 --> 12:38.990
a few things about, you know,
a little contour,

19:43.316 --> 19:44.916
and she felt like
she had nowhere to go,

19:44.918 --> 19:46.651
and she told me she was
getting ready to run away.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.985
Right.
And I was, like, okay,

19:47.987 --> 19:49.820
come to my house for the night,
let's figure this out.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.022
Then I found out the rules.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.857
Her lawyer advised us
to go to court.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.692
Right.
Right now, my place

19:54.694 --> 19:56.394
is a visiting
residential for her.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.329
Okay.
So, the next thing they told me

19:58.331 --> 20:03.301
is I have to become
a foster mother.
Right.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.435
And that's really
the only way

20:04.437 --> 20:08.239
that she can
live with me, um, so,

20:08.241 --> 20:12.677
with your blessing, I would
love to take on that role.

20:12.679 --> 20:16.647
I didn't want Infinity to be
a runaway child, you know.

20:16.649 --> 20:19.183
I want to do what
I think is best for her.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.352
I'm a single mom,
I have six children.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.822
Mmm.
Four boys and two girls.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.390
I do what I do for them,

20:26.392 --> 20:28.559
try to be the best
parent that I can be.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.796
I want her to go where
she's happy and she's safe.

20:31.798 --> 20:35.299
Talking to Infinity's mother
makes me feel like she's

20:35.301 --> 20:38.402
a level-headed, concerned
mother that just wants

20:38.404 --> 20:40.071
the best for her daughter.

20:40.073 --> 20:44.342
If you talk to Infinity you
hear a totally different story.

20:44.344 --> 20:48.045
Because I didn't want to pry and
I still feel like she's young,

20:48.047 --> 20:50.181
I didn't try to get
any background information

20:50.183 --> 20:53.217
or what happened, why--
because I don't feel like

20:53.219 --> 20:55.886
that's a conversation
that I should have

20:55.888 --> 20:57.355
with a child, you know?
Right.

20:57.357 --> 21:01.259
Infinity, growing up,
she was always a sweet girl,

21:01.261 --> 21:04.795
and once she became a teenager,
she started giving me trouble.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.131
She would wait till I'd go
to sleep, and then she would

21:07.133 --> 21:09.133
sneak out and I would
catch her coming back in,

21:09.135 --> 21:11.402
two and three o'clock
in the morning.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.137
Mmm.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.972
And then, like, in November,

21:14.974 --> 21:18.476
someone called the children's
services on me and they said

21:18.478 --> 21:22.413
that I was abusing
my kids and, you know,

21:22.415 --> 21:24.982
they just were saying a lot of
things that was really untrue,

21:24.984 --> 21:26.717
so you know.

21:26.719 --> 21:30.955
And then, they wanted to place
her somewhere, and my mom,

21:30.957 --> 21:32.723
I asked her and I said,
would you be willing

21:32.725 --> 21:35.660
to take Infinity
and she said sure.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.561
But my mom has rules,
and you come in the house

21:37.563 --> 21:40.331
after a certain hour,
you're not getting in.

21:40.333 --> 21:43.401
Mm-hmm.
So, you know, she don't
want to stay with my mom's.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.671
That's the reason why she left.
Right. So, Infinity didn't

21:46.673 --> 21:49.173
grow up in the foster
care system.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.609
No, she never grew up
in the foster care system.

21:53.546 --> 21:54.779
(Yandy)
Infinity has a totally

21:54.781 --> 21:56.814
different story--
from what she told me,

21:56.816 --> 21:58.516
she's been shuttled
in and out

21:58.518 --> 22:01.585
of the foster care system
since birth.

22:01.587 --> 22:02.887
I don't know what to think.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.089
I just want to do
the right thing.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.191
I think you'll be
a good foster mom.

22:07.193 --> 22:11.262
Okay. I'm gonna do my best, you
know, I'm learning every day.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.491
I feel like I let both of y'all
down because if I was there

38:48.493 --> 38:50.060
this (bleep) wouldn't
be happening, if I never

38:50.062 --> 38:51.861
left Memphis this (bleep)
wouldn't be happening.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.130
This (bleep)
would not be happening.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.832
We'd still be together,
we'd still be having a family,

38:55.834 --> 38:57.934
we wouldn't be in this
situation, and all I can do

38:57.936 --> 38:59.569
is look in the (bleep)
mirror and be like,

38:59.571 --> 39:01.137
you look like you're
living your best life

39:01.139 --> 39:03.373
and my (bleep) daughter's
in the (bleep) putting pillows

39:03.375 --> 39:05.442
over her sister's ears because
they're fighting in the house

39:05.444 --> 39:09.913
and my baby mom's shot
a (bleep) and I'm not there.

39:09.915 --> 39:12.549
And I'm sorry,
I'm (bleep) sorry, right?

39:12.551 --> 39:15.785
That's all I can be
right now is (bleep) sorry,

39:15.787 --> 39:20.190
because I should've been there
for y'all, and I wasn't.

39:20.192 --> 39:21.591
And so--
It's not your fault, Rich.

39:21.593 --> 39:24.761
It is!
It's not your fault.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.163
I (bleep) up with a lot of
people, man, I guess.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.332
I don't know,
I don't know.

39:29.334 --> 39:32.569
But I feel worse because I
(bleep) love you (bleep) death.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.372
I'll be in Mississippi, we're
going to bring the family down,

39:35.374 --> 39:38.108
we're going to do what we do,
we're gonna fight it and,

39:38.110 --> 39:39.809
and you need to
sit with somebody,

39:39.811 --> 39:42.212
little girl, in therapy.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.414
You've been dealing
with it for a while.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.950
You're 19, you think
you're krunk, but you're not.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.651
Like, you're still my baby,
you're still her baby,

39:48.653 --> 39:50.153
you're gonna be that
till you die.

39:50.155 --> 39:53.423
So we all need to figure
this (bleep) out, for you.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.870
(Jonathan)
Next time on "Love & Hip Hop"...

40:06.872 --> 40:09.472
I have a friend, they have,
like, this beautiful winery.

40:09.474 --> 40:10.707
So I want to bring
the girls out...

40:10.709 --> 40:12.442
Yeah.
But I want it to be peaceful,

40:12.444 --> 40:15.545
I don't want it to be crazy.
I'm gonna be on
my best behavior.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.148
Did you invite
Sidney Starr to this?

40:18.150 --> 40:19.916
I really miss
your friendship.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.018
Then why are you flinching at
bitches that are nice to you?

40:22.020 --> 40:24.387
It was a way for you
to kind of shut up.

40:24.389 --> 40:25.889
Do you want to get
beat the (bleep) up?

40:25.891 --> 40:27.390
No!
Do you want that?

40:27.392 --> 40:31.194
I see on social media Yandy,
she adopted a little girl.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.662
Ooh, child.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.764
That (bleep)
is (bleep), okay?

40:34.766 --> 40:36.900
It looks good for her
on social media.

40:36.902 --> 40:40.103
Kim, you love calling me messy--
what are you doing?

40:40.105 --> 40:42.272
I don't need friends at the end
of the day, I got myself.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.606
You're making this
about you.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.542
Nobody's coming
at you like that.

40:45.544 --> 40:47.877
What you wanna do?
Nah, we're not doing this.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.312
You don't--

40:49.314 --> 40:50.747
We're going to have to
go to trial,

40:50.749 --> 40:52.782
unless they come
with a better offer.

40:52.784 --> 40:53.917
What?

40:53.919 --> 40:55.185
You don't piss
the state off.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.289
(bailiff)
All rise.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.093
You gotta be (bleep)
kidding me.
