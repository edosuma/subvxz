00:10.200 --> 00:11.240
You saw her?

00:12.800 --> 00:13.920
Did you talk to her?

00:15.120 --> 00:16.680
She was unconscious.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.400
So how can you be sure she's alive?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.080
She's alive.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.520
-I'm going to her.
-You're not going anywhere.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.120
Let go of me, Leo. Let go. This is my mom!

00:36.680 --> 00:37.920
-Let go!
-You can't go there.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.400
-It's too dangerous.
-I'm not afraid of them.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.080
[sighs] I know you're not.

00:51.560 --> 00:52.800
It's gonna be okay.

00:54.160 --> 00:56.160
I can't believe she's alive.

00:59.440 --> 01:00.640
I have to tell someone.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.560
I wasn't even supposed to tell you.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.400
If we tell anyone,
your mother's life will be in danger.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.600
What do I do now, Leo?

01:10.680 --> 01:12.280
I know it's hard...

01:13.280 --> 01:15.160
but Marcus was very clear.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.320
And I believe him.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.360
I knew Hayley
shouldn't have gone with him.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.160
That's it. I'm gonna go see my mom.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.080
Wait. Don't go yet.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.840
-Why not?
-'Cause we should wait for Hayley.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.960
No. I'm done waiting. I'm going.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.760
There's something I need to tell you.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.360
[theme music playing]

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600
That...

02:19.240 --> 02:20.640
that's impossible, Hayley.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.680
Leo saw her.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.760
She's alive, Alex.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.600
Marcus will wake her when they've
accomplished their mission.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.880
So he knew?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.960
He knew where she was the whole time?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.760
And he let us just suffer and mourn?

02:38.840 --> 02:40.960
I don't think he had a choice.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.520
Why would Marcus tell you all this?

02:43.600 --> 02:45.800
I guess he trusted me
to deliver his message.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.840
So he just let you see Ryan
and just walked you right out of there?

02:49.920 --> 02:52.600
Am I the only one who thinks
this doesn't make sense?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.520
-What exactly are you trying to say?
-I don't know, Leo.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.800
Daniel, he just saw my mom.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.760
-Look, I know you wanna believe him--
-I do believe him.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.000
Did you forget the last time Marcus
had a one-on-one talk with someone?

03:04.760 --> 03:07.880
I was sure he was going to hypnotize me,
but he didn't.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.200
I think he just really wanted
to talk to someone.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.240
He hates working for these people.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.560
He was tempted by the money at first,
but now he's in too deep.

03:17.720 --> 03:18.720
And so is Ryan.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.160
How deep, exactly? Do we have
any idea what they're planning?

03:24.240 --> 03:28.080
All I know is, whatever it is,
it's gonna be over in a few hours.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.120
We do know they know
when an earthquake is going to happen.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.280
Maybe they're just waiting
for another one?

03:34.360 --> 03:35.640
[Brooke] That makes no sense.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.760
What's the use in waiting
for an earthquake to hit you?

03:38.840 --> 03:40.800
You're right.
And we shouldn't be waiting, either.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.920
A lot of bad things
can happen in a few hours.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.720
-I'm gonna go find my mom.
-No!

03:46.520 --> 03:47.960
We're not gonna do anything.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.440
We're gonna wait here
until Marcus wakes our mom up.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.560
We're at the final stages.
It'll be no more than two hours.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.720
[distorted voice over phone]  Good.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.360
Now, if you don't mind,
I want you to open the cave door.

04:06.040 --> 04:09.040
-Why?
-You have some guests.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.640
[door buzzer sounds]

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
What's going on?

04:21.920 --> 04:23.440
Kyle, what are you doing here?

04:23.520 --> 04:26.040
[voice over phone]  I have a lot of money
riding on your success today.

04:26.120 --> 04:30.280
Kyle and his team are here
to make sure there's no funny business.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.680
What funny business?

04:31.760 --> 04:35.760
The 5.2 microquake
you created for our pilot was impressive.

04:35.840 --> 04:40.280
But today, I need you to triple
the output of the seismic activity.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.760
Triple? You can't be serious.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.080
That would not only destroy the plant,
but...

04:47.000 --> 04:48.080
We'll get it done.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.600
I'm happy to hear that.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.680
[cell phone vibrating]

04:59.880 --> 05:03.040
[sighs] Why is he never available
when we need him?

05:03.120 --> 05:04.280
Unbelievable.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.280
Go easy on him.
Maybe he's out on a mission.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.400
-You two should be happy your mom's alive.
-I'll be happy when I see her.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.760
I don't know how
I'll get through this day.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.640
Look, I think we should each
go our own separate ways

05:17.720 --> 05:19.280
before people get suspicious.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.840
Remember,
we have a game in less than an hour.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.280
That's right. It's your first game
back since your injury.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.080
Yeah. My mom will be there.
We can keep an eye on her.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.880
Great, we'll all go to your game.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
Let's go.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.200
Oh, wait, hang on.
Let's think about this for a minute.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.040
We all busted our butts
to figure out what's going on.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.560
We're so close to stopping them.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.520
Do you expect us to let them hurt Ryan?

05:46.160 --> 05:47.760
Well, don't go around
putting words in my mouth.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.880
I'm just saying,
we don't know what they're planning.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.920
We could be very sorry
we did nothing to stop them.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.720
We've made our decision, Daniel.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
"We"?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.480
Because it sounds like you
made the decision for everyone.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.400
-Well, someone had to stop your mother.
-What did you just say?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.160
If it wasn't for your mom,
we wouldn't be here in the first place.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.600
Are you kidding me?
I've been spying on my mom the whole time!

06:04.680 --> 06:05.600
-[Alex] Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Get off me!

06:05.680 --> 06:07.800
I can't believe we're about to give up
like a bunch of losers!

06:07.880 --> 06:10.600
I keep forgetting you're not very good
at understanding complex situations.

06:10.680 --> 06:13.920
-[Alex] Hey! Hey!
-Stop it! Stop! I can't take this anymore!

06:21.720 --> 06:23.200
[indistinct chatter]

06:43.600 --> 06:44.600
May I?

06:48.120 --> 06:49.120
Yeah.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.720
I know what you must think of me
and I probably deserve it.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.000
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you, uh...

07:03.320 --> 07:04.880
that time at the beach...

07:07.080 --> 07:11.320
I don't know why I didn't just go on
and grab you the moment I saw you.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.400
I just...

07:14.760 --> 07:16.480
I just hated how he looked at you.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.800
[scoffs] And I know it's awful, but...

07:21.960 --> 07:24.200
I wanted you out of his life.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.760
And then that earthquake happened.
It was like...

07:30.800 --> 07:32.880
It was like the perfect crime.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.280
It was like I made it happen.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.840
What did you just say?

07:41.960 --> 07:45.520
[stammers] I didn't mean to...

07:47.280 --> 07:48.280
That's it.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.960
How could we have missed this?

07:52.040 --> 07:53.360
What?

07:53.440 --> 07:54.760
They made it happen!

07:56.280 --> 07:58.840
Thank you, Aspen. Without you,
I wouldn't have figured it out.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.240
Thank you. Thank you!

08:02.040 --> 08:03.480
I know what they're planning!

08:03.560 --> 08:04.760
The earthquake we had,

08:04.840 --> 08:06.720
they weren't waiting for it,
they created it.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.960
-What?
-What do you mean?

08:08.040 --> 08:10.720
They somehow created it
from inside the cave. I'm sure of it.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.640
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's the only thing that makes sense.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.600
Marcus told Leo they were
close to finishing their mission.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.680
Right! So they weren't waiting
for an earthquake to happen.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.480
Why would someone do that?

08:20.560 --> 08:22.200
Okay. Let's assume you're right.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.600
We wouldn't wanna do anything
that puts Mom at risk, right?

08:24.680 --> 08:27.360
I don't know, Alex.
Maybe we should reconsider.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.120
What's there to reconsider?
Hayley, we agreed on this.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.200
You don't know my mom.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.760
She wouldn't want us to just stand here
and let something awful happen

08:33.840 --> 08:36.120
without trying to stop it. Right, Alex?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.200
And Daniel's right too.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.000
We didn't do all this work
to just give up now.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.159
So what do you think we should do, Hayley?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.840
That satellite that Emma took offline.
Is there a way to bring it back on?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.520
So what's the plan, exactly?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.320
Emma told me she managed to hack
into the NASA servers using my computer.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.280
The satellite is still up there.
We just need to reverse the process.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.760
So we have to unhack the NASA servers?

09:03.840 --> 09:05.520
Exactly. Once the satellite is online,

09:05.600 --> 09:07.320
they'll be exposed
and they'll have to call off their plan.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.680
Oh, you didn't tell me it'd be that easy.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.600
[chuckles] That Emma. She's too good.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.720
What do you mean?

09:18.680 --> 09:22.360
[sighs] She left absolutely no trace
of her hacking work.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.040
It's like she was a ghost.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.320
Think of it this way.
If she'd have left a footprint,

09:26.400 --> 09:28.080
they would've traced it
back to your laptop

09:28.160 --> 09:30.600
and you would have been arrested long ago.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.600
But Emma's the only one
who knows how to fix this.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.560
-Let's ask her for help.
-Her phone's disconnected.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.840
[sighs] There has to be
another way to reach her.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.880
I know. Let's try her parents.
Let me get their names real quick.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.040
Here, try this number.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.040
[line beeping]

09:54.120 --> 09:56.000
They've been disconnected too.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.560
[sighs] She really is a ghost.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.400
Someone in the Greenhouse
is snooping after Emma Geller again.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.280
Really?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.960
And also tried her parents this time.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.720
[sighs] I'll take care of it.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.960
[cell phone vibrating]

10:27.440 --> 10:28.520
What is it?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.200
[Eric on phone]  Houston,
we have a problem.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.560
I don't see my mom anywhere.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.000
Text her. Tell her you want
her to come to the game.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.120
Yeah, that's a good idea.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.320
[announcer] And now, a special
welcome back to our Eagles' captain,

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
Daniel Hayward!

11:04.480 --> 11:06.000
[crowd cheering]

11:26.880 --> 11:29.600
-What was that for?
-For good luck.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.480
It was Jason's responsibility.
He totally dropped the ball with Emma.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.200
I can fix this, but I will need access
to the main server for the Louie network.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.360
The only access to the network
is in Louis' office.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.040
-I'll handle it.
-[cell phone chimes]

11:50.120 --> 11:51.360
Who's that from?

11:52.360 --> 11:54.360
-It's my son.
-What does it say?

11:55.280 --> 11:57.320
Excuse me?
How is this any of your business?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.960
He has a game right now.
He wants me to come watch him play.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.200
Is it close by?

12:07.960 --> 12:11.720
You should go to the game, then.
I'll deal with the other problem.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.000
Tell Jason I'm coming.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.960
Keep an eye on these two.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.560
[crowd cheering]

12:25.640 --> 12:28.160
All right, I want you to get out there.
I want you to play hard.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.440
Execute and focus
and stick to the fundamentals.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.000
Hands in. On three.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.120
[players] One, two, three, Eagles!

12:34.200 --> 12:35.200
[coach] Go get 'em!

12:37.760 --> 12:39.040
[whistle blows]

12:39.120 --> 12:41.080
[Jackie over Louie]  Hayley,
we have a problem.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.280
We can't reach Emma,
but Max is running this...

12:44.360 --> 12:45.200
What is it?

12:45.280 --> 12:47.280
A combinatorial search
using a quantum algorithm

12:47.360 --> 12:49.240
-to look for hidden history files.
-Max is running a search.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.520
-How long will it take?
-How long will it take?

12:51.600 --> 12:53.000
Anywhere between ten minutes
and two weeks.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.080
I got it.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.920
Hey, Sophie, listen. I have to tell you--

12:58.000 --> 13:00.400
I guess it pays to be
a backstabbing diva, huh?

13:00.480 --> 13:01.480
What?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.680
Yeah, I, uh... I heard you and Alex
are back together.

13:04.760 --> 13:05.600
Breaking news.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.360
Do you want to hear
some really breaking news?

13:11.600 --> 13:15.400
-Who are you again?
-I'm Kyle. Judy didn't tell you?

13:15.480 --> 13:17.840
-She did, but--
-You've done a rotten job,

13:17.920 --> 13:19.280
left a lot of loose ends.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.560
Now, are you going to help me
fix it or not?

13:23.520 --> 13:24.520
Good.

13:24.600 --> 13:29.240
I want to see all the phone messages
sent out on this network in the last hour.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.320
Show me the command functions.

13:50.480 --> 13:54.120
Jason, don't tell me you found
a replacement for Marcus this quickly?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.840
I have. This is Kyle.

13:58.520 --> 13:59.560
Hi.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.360
Welcome.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.640
I don't have time to chat.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.800
I'm on my way to an educators' conference

14:04.880 --> 14:08.120
on technology and innovation
in Santa Barbara.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Good job, son.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
Nice to have you.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.200
[crowd cheering]

14:19.280 --> 14:20.400
Wow. That...

14:22.200 --> 14:25.080
that has to be the craziest story
I've ever heard in my life.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.400
Yeah. And it's a story
you can never tell anyone.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.520
[clicks tongue] Man, that's too bad,

14:30.600 --> 14:33.560
'cause I have the best headline
for this story.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.880
And I got my best friend back.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.400
Tough defense! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

14:46.480 --> 14:47.640
All the way!

14:50.880 --> 14:52.760
-Yeah!
-[crowd cheering]

14:59.560 --> 15:01.480
[buzzer sounds]

15:09.440 --> 15:11.400
You made it, Mom. That's great.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.760
Now, when have I ever missed
an important game of yours?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.640
I don't know. I thought you were busy.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.640
What's wrong, Daniel?

15:19.520 --> 15:22.960
Nothing. I'm just nervous.
This is a big game.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.080
Yeah, we've both
been through a rough time lately.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.800
We deserve a vacation.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.680
Yeah, we could just get out of here
for the next couple of days.

15:32.760 --> 15:33.920
You know, clear our heads.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.160
Remember that time we went
to Martha's Vineyard for Memorial Day?

15:37.240 --> 15:40.280
We could do that again.
You know, it'd be like the old times.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.960
In fact, we can leave tonight,
right after the victory celebration.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.120
What do you think?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.200
I don't feel like running off.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.640
Running off?
Nobody's talking about running off.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.920
What are you talking about?

15:55.200 --> 15:56.640
Did something happen, Daniel?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.800
[buzzer sounds]

16:00.560 --> 16:02.600
Okay, baby. Well, do your thing!

16:08.720 --> 16:09.720
Stop.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.600
-Whose number is that?
-It belongs to Jackie Sanders.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.640
I told my dad not to accept her.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.360
[mockingly]
"I told my dad not to accept her."

16:19.440 --> 16:22.400
You're pathetic. Start the GPS program.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.640
She's with Miller at his computer lab.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.320
-Where is it?
-Basement.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.720
Basement.
So it must be pretty secluded, right?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.920
What's that? Is that bad?
I swear, I didn't touch anything.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.440
Wait, no, it's good. The algorithm
found the hidden encrypted file.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.080
I have no idea what that means,
but it sounds good.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.240
I'm gonna call Hayley now.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.560
Emma's code is so beautifully written.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.280
Sorry. All I have to do now is...

16:57.200 --> 16:58.920
-Oh, no.
-What happened?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.120
Uh... It's probably just a power failure.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.440
The backup generator should come back on
and I'll be able to reboot the program.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.599
Okay, now I have to check
the circuit-breakers.

17:08.680 --> 17:09.839
[nail gun firing]

17:13.640 --> 17:16.440
-It's locked from outside!
-How could this be?

17:17.079 --> 17:19.359
Oh, no. They're on to us, Max.

17:19.440 --> 17:20.520
They know what we're up to,

17:20.599 --> 17:23.200
and they... they turned off the power
so we can't get the satellite up.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.640
Help! We're stuck inside!

17:26.240 --> 17:27.200
Hold it.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.240
[rapid knocking at door]

17:34.200 --> 17:35.400
[grunts]

17:40.720 --> 17:44.640
Uh... Operation system froze.

17:46.120 --> 17:50.200
I, uh... I need to check
the servers to fix this.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.800
How is my dear?

18:23.560 --> 18:24.920
You don't know it,

18:26.120 --> 18:27.960
but I'm gonna wake you up today.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.520
I'm reducing the dosage
of your anesthetics.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.720
You will soon see your children again.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.680
[cell phone vibrating]

18:56.320 --> 18:57.560
[crowd cheering]

19:05.280 --> 19:07.080
That's the way we do it!

19:07.160 --> 19:09.880
The game's gonna end in four minutes.
Begin the countdown.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.200
Brooke. [chuckles]
What are you doing here?

19:13.280 --> 19:16.640
Um, I was actually gonna go get a drink.
Would you like something?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.800
Oh, no. Thank you, honey.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.600
[coach] Keep it cool!
Move it up! Move it up!

19:30.720 --> 19:33.040
Hit it, Woods. Hit it, Woods. Yeah!

19:36.160 --> 19:38.120
Both Max and Jackie
aren't answering their Louies.

19:38.200 --> 19:39.200
Something is going on.

19:39.280 --> 19:41.720
They're probably just busy.
I'm sure everything's fine.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.880
We have a problem.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.400
They're starting the program
at the final whistle.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.120
[Leo] The game's almost over.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.000
-Hey. Where are you going?
-I can't sit here anymore.

19:57.360 --> 20:02.120
[coach] All right! All right!
Keep it focused! Keep it tight!

20:03.240 --> 20:05.360
Soph! Soph!

20:05.440 --> 20:08.400
Hey. Is there a way to make
the game last longer somehow?

20:08.480 --> 20:09.400
Why would you wanna do that?

20:09.480 --> 20:11.480
Judy's starting her plan
at the end of the game.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.440
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:15.960 --> 20:16.960
Okay.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.600
Okay, I think I know what we can do.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.360
[inaudible]

20:35.840 --> 20:37.680
We have to keep the game going
as long as possible.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.600
-Why?
-Max and Jackie are off the grid.

20:39.680 --> 20:41.120
We need to buy more time.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.600
What? We're up by 15
and there's three minutes left.

20:43.680 --> 20:44.840
How are we gonna do this?

20:45.680 --> 20:47.880
-What are you doing?
-I'm going crazy doing...

20:47.960 --> 20:50.320
sitting around doing nothing.
I'm going there.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.080
Where? To the cave? Are you crazy?

20:52.160 --> 20:53.520
I should have done this sooner.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.600
My mom is in there and in danger,
and I'm gonna keep her safe.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.520
That is not a good idea.
Let's stick to the plan.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.280
What plan, Leo? Max and Jackie
aren't answering their Louies,

21:01.360 --> 21:03.080
I have no idea what happened to my dad,

21:03.160 --> 21:04.680
and my mom is lying in that cave

21:04.760 --> 21:06.880
completely dependent on people
that don't even want her alive.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.120
-Hayley, listen to me.
-I know what you're gonna say,

21:09.200 --> 21:11.920
but my mom needs me,
and that's all that matters to me now.
