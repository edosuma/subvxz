00:18.708 --> 00:21.667
Here we are, jerks.
Cloudcracker Prison. Your new home.

00:25.542 --> 00:26.958
Well, looky here.

00:27.042 --> 00:30.417
-Word of advice. Don't drop the soap.
-Why?

00:30.500 --> 00:33.250
Because prison soap is expensive.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.583
This is going to be a nightmare, sir.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.792
Locked away behind bars
of steelium and chromium

00:38.875 --> 00:41.875
and several other kinds of "iums."

00:41.958 --> 00:43.917
It's barbaric. It's inhumane.
It's--

00:44.000 --> 00:45.292
Magnificent!

00:45.375 --> 00:49.708
Some of the vilest villains in Skylands,
AKA my soon-to-be associates,

00:49.792 --> 00:52.333
are imprisoned within these walls.

00:52.417 --> 00:54.542
And I can't wait to cause chaos,

00:54.625 --> 00:56.917
the C-H kind, with all of them!

00:59.167 --> 01:02.583
I hope that was prison soap.

01:33.375 --> 01:35.667
Welcome to Cloudcracker Prison.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.208
As you know,
all new Skylanders are required

01:38.292 --> 01:40.958
to serve a day of guard duty
here, at the prison.

01:41.042 --> 01:44.500
Master Eon believes
it's the best way to expose you

01:44.583 --> 01:47.042
to the worst of the worst
you'll face in our universe.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.708
Bring on the bad guys.

01:48.792 --> 01:50.500
Soon enough, Spyro.

01:50.583 --> 01:52.792
And the best way
to keep them all in line?

01:52.875 --> 01:54.000
This beauty.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.708
A shiny commemorative prison broach?

01:56.792 --> 01:58.750
No, it's a badge.

01:58.833 --> 02:02.542
And they're all equipped with a chip
that emits a powerful freezing ray.

02:02.625 --> 02:05.875
Give it a tap and an inmate
is rendered completely immobile.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.958
Cool! Can I try it out, Snap Shot?

02:08.042 --> 02:09.458
Be my guest.

02:09.542 --> 02:10.875
Aw...

02:10.958 --> 02:12.417
Come on.

02:13.208 --> 02:14.958
That's enough, Spyro.

02:15.042 --> 02:18.250
If you happen to slip
and give your badge a double tap,

02:18.333 --> 02:20.375
it will administer the toughest
punishment we have.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.792
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

02:21.875 --> 02:24.625
If you encounter someone
who is really causing trouble,

02:24.708 --> 02:27.958
tapping twice will send a prisoner
straight to solitary confinement.

02:28.042 --> 02:29.208
Otherwise known as...

02:29.292 --> 02:30.417
the hole.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.542
Whoa! That place sounds scary.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.708
Ah, it is, when I say it
in my scary voice.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.417
The hole.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.125
But, luckily for you three,

02:40.208 --> 02:43.292
the prisoners rarely act out enough
to deserve going there.

02:43.375 --> 02:47.917
Now, remember, Cloudcracker Prison
is a hornet's nest of nefarious villainy.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.667
Guard duty is no walk in the park.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.167
To do the job right,

02:51.250 --> 02:54.250
you must read the prison rules
and regulations guides.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.000
Eh, I'm pretty sure we can handle
a few brochures.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.542
Uh, these are 20% off coupons
from Bird Bath &amp; Beyond.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.625
I get, like,
nine of these things a week.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.250
Those are the guides.

03:04.333 --> 03:07.458
Uh, yeah...
I'm more of a film adaptation type.

03:07.542 --> 03:11.000
Now then, while every prisoner here
is dangerous,

03:11.083 --> 03:14.375
there are a few that are
the cream of the crud.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.625
First up, there's Wolfgang.

03:16.708 --> 03:20.458
His evil bone harp can turn anyone
who hears its rocking tunes

03:20.542 --> 03:23.000
into a mindless drone to do his bidding.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.333
Yeah!

03:24.417 --> 03:25.708
Next is Pepper Jack.

03:25.792 --> 03:28.792
Once the finest chef in all the Skylands,

03:28.875 --> 03:31.417
until he decided
to use his culinary powers

03:31.500 --> 03:34.542
to try and destroy his enemies
from the inside out.

03:34.625 --> 03:37.833
Hoo-whee! I can smell your fear.

03:37.917 --> 03:41.000
Oh, sorry, that's just my
toilet bouillabaisse.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.083
Then there's Broccoli Guy.

03:43.167 --> 03:46.625
He wields the power of healing
and being highly annoying,

03:46.708 --> 03:48.208
which is quite lethal in its own right.

03:48.292 --> 03:52.958
Hi, I'm Broccoli Guy.
Come a little closer.

03:53.042 --> 03:55.083
Broccoli is bad for you.

03:59.292 --> 04:01.292
Then we have Chompy Mage,

04:01.375 --> 04:04.833
a deranged wizard who thinks he's,
well, a chompy.

04:04.917 --> 04:08.458
Best not to get any digits too close
to his or his puppet's mouth.

04:08.542 --> 04:12.208
And most dangerous of all.
The Golden Queen.

04:12.292 --> 04:15.667
She can turn anything
or anyone into gold.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.166
Never let her out of your sight,

04:17.250 --> 04:19.916
as she is the shrewd and cunning leader
of this motley crew,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.792
who call themselves the Doom Raiders.

04:23.875 --> 04:27.000
They are always up to no good,
believe you me.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.917
Glummy, it's Golden Queen!

04:29.000 --> 04:32.333
My villainous equal and number one crush
since I was a boy!

04:32.417 --> 04:33.500
I should tell her, right?

04:33.583 --> 04:36.583
Best to just get a feel for her
and this place first, sir.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.792
All right, guys,
let's crush this assignment.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.958
I know we'd rather be out in Skylands
taking down evildoers,

04:42.042 --> 04:45.333
but I'm sure if we're on top of our game,
this will be an easy, uneventful day.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.833
I hope so.
The inmates here sound pretty hardcore.

04:47.917 --> 04:51.708
Seriously. Just to be safe,
we should keep reading these rule guides.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.042
Good thinking, Eruptor.
If we all buckle down,

04:54.125 --> 04:55.792
we'll get through these things
before we know it.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.083
Done! Super speed reading for the win.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.583
What's that? Fire drill?

05:00.667 --> 05:03.125
Prison riot?
Emergency exit door ajar?

05:03.208 --> 05:05.417
Page 87, article 14,
code 7A, says,

05:05.500 --> 05:08.208
"No inmate shall refer to the color orange
as the new black

05:08.292 --> 05:09.875
without authorized written permission."

05:09.958 --> 05:12.042
Huh? Oops, sorry, wrong alarm code.

05:12.125 --> 05:16.083
Page 568, article 93,
code 23ZZ,

05:16.167 --> 05:19.583
that's the siren that alerts the prisoners
it's time for yard duty.

05:19.667 --> 05:23.375
Okay, team, let's get out there
and, uh...

05:23.458 --> 05:24.792
guard.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.000
Mind spotting me, big boy?

05:38.417 --> 05:39.833
Did you see that, Glummy?

05:39.917 --> 05:44.125
She turned that convict into gold
without batting a beautiful golden eye.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.125
I think I'm in love.

05:46.208 --> 05:47.333
Love.

05:47.417 --> 05:49.583
Maybe don't lead with that, sir.

05:56.458 --> 05:59.667
Oh, yeah. Feel the burn.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.458
-Have we met?
-Well, not formally,

06:02.542 --> 06:05.542
but I am sure you have,
no doubt, heard of me.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.167
For I... am...

06:08.375 --> 06:09.583
Kaos!

06:11.583 --> 06:13.375
Seriously?

06:13.458 --> 06:14.667
Nobody knows me?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.292
Nah, we know you.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.125
You're the loser
who still lives at home with his mama.

06:19.208 --> 06:21.625
Well, I just wanted to say

06:21.708 --> 06:25.375
what an honor it is to be incarcerated
here with you, Golden Queen.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.500
With all of you.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.750
Noted. Now, kindly step off

06:28.833 --> 06:31.875
before I turn you into a dumbbell,
dumbbell.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.708
Well, eh, pleasure meeting you,
talk soon.

06:34.792 --> 06:38.125
Have a delightful workout,
your Goldenness!

06:38.208 --> 06:40.417
What a loser.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.417
Thinking he can just walk up
and talk to the Queen.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.333
That newb needs an education
on how we do things around here.

06:47.417 --> 06:50.417
First, you gotta fill out an application
to talk with her.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.000
Pipe down, Chef.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.792
Kaos would no doubt be a nuisance

06:53.875 --> 06:58.292
if we didn't need a patsy
for our long-gestating evil plan.

06:58.375 --> 07:00.625
Ooh, right! That plan.

07:00.708 --> 07:02.125
Such a killer plan!

07:02.208 --> 07:04.667
I like plans with good friends.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.000
Ugh! You are so lame.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.792
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, it's okay, Pepper Jack.

07:09.875 --> 07:13.583
She insulted Broccoli Guy,
so I like her already.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.625
Would you like to join our gang?

07:15.708 --> 07:17.250
Totally!

07:18.208 --> 07:19.458
Whoa, inmate.

07:19.542 --> 07:20.917
No fraternizing with the rodents.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.833
Page 107, subsection 7C of the manual.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.750
He's not a rodent,
he's my best furry little friend.

07:26.833 --> 07:28.000
Back talking?

07:28.083 --> 07:30.833
Page 802, article 73. Infraction.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.708
Not again.

07:32.792 --> 07:34.875
Avenge me, Dougie.

07:36.292 --> 07:37.833
Attempted assault with a deadly squirrel.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.500
That's it. To the hole!

07:40.583 --> 07:43.833
-Uh... did we do that right?
-Indeed, you did.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.458
But I'm shocked
at how that inmate was acting out.

07:46.542 --> 07:50.208
It's not like him or his squirrel at all.
Keep your guard up, Skylanders.

07:50.292 --> 07:53.208
Something is afoot. I can feel it.

07:53.292 --> 07:56.667
Yes, I do believe
these trigger-happy new guards

07:56.750 --> 08:01.125
will prove useful so that we can finally
enact our diabolical plan.

08:13.208 --> 08:15.250
Guard duty, huh?

08:15.333 --> 08:16.875
Yep, remember that. Whoa!

08:16.958 --> 08:19.667
Not exciting,
but something we gotta do, dudes.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.542
-Whoa!
-Exactly.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.792
But don't worry,
you're not missing much on this side.

08:23.875 --> 08:26.500
It's just another "routine" day over here.

08:26.583 --> 08:28.542
"Routine"?
So what are we hearing?

08:28.625 --> 08:29.958
Oh, that?

08:30.042 --> 08:32.667
We're just facing Gulper,
the gelatinous giant.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.707
Pretty much the greatest battle ever.

08:34.792 --> 08:38.542
Assuming we make it out alive,
we'll see you guys back at the academy.

08:38.625 --> 08:40.582
Later!

08:40.667 --> 08:44.000
An epic battle against Gulper
and we're stuck here.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.583
It's only one day, Eruptor.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.583
Now, here.
Keep going over the rules and regs.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.750
We need to stay one step ahead
of the inmates, right?

08:50.833 --> 08:52.875
Right. On it, Elfy.

08:53.833 --> 08:54.917
Oh.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.750
Elfy, can you read page two to me?

08:57.833 --> 08:59.792
So, about our prison break.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.917
In order to finally make our escape,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.750
we will require a little...
private time, if you will.

09:05.833 --> 09:09.625
Well, we're never gonna get any of that
with Kaos coming around all the time.

09:09.708 --> 09:12.708
Seriously!
With that gargantuan noggin of his,

09:12.792 --> 09:15.458
it's like he's got
a giant flashing arrow that says,

09:15.542 --> 09:17.250
"Hey, guards, look at me!"

09:17.333 --> 09:19.167
Which translates to "look at us."

09:19.250 --> 09:20.958
Could not agree more, Chompy,

09:21.042 --> 09:25.667
which is why we need to start working
the patsy angle on our escape plan now.

09:25.750 --> 09:28.583
Bring me that big-headed blowhard.

09:31.167 --> 09:33.708
I could ask Golden Queen
on a prison date.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.583
Maybe get her a gift.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.208
Perhaps, a shank
made from hardened toothpaste?

09:38.292 --> 09:41.875
Or, show her the tattoo I got of her
on my calf muscle.

09:41.958 --> 09:43.333
You got ink, sir?

09:44.292 --> 09:45.417
Hardcore, right?

09:45.500 --> 09:47.375
Straight outta Skylands, sir.

09:48.042 --> 09:51.125
Perhaps we should be spending our time
devising a plan to escape this place

09:51.208 --> 09:54.542
instead of crafting effigies
made from unidentifiable mush.

09:54.625 --> 09:55.958
That's it, Glumshanks!

09:56.042 --> 09:59.208
I shall devise a brilliantly evil
escape plan,

09:59.292 --> 10:02.375
let the Golden Queen
and her gang in on it, and then,

10:02.458 --> 10:04.167
she'll surely want me
by her side!

10:04.250 --> 10:06.250
Golden Queen wants you by her side.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.625
See? It's happening already!

10:08.708 --> 10:10.917
Manifest destiny, sir.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.583
Or dumb, stupid, coincidence

10:12.667 --> 10:14.750
that is surely linked
to an ulterior motive.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.000
Dealer's choice.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.417
My Queen, a million thanks for allowing me
the honor of dining in your company,

10:20.500 --> 10:25.333
as well as the opportunity to impress you
with my diabolically evil mind.

10:25.417 --> 10:28.250
To wit, I have come up with...

10:28.333 --> 10:30.500
- an escape plan.
- How amazing.

10:30.583 --> 10:33.417
You're probably the first inmate
to ever conceive of such a thing.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.417
-Please, do elaborate.
-Wonderful!

10:35.500 --> 10:39.083
So, you see,
each cell contains a sink and a... well,

10:39.167 --> 10:41.375
you know, that...
that other thing that flushes.

10:41.458 --> 10:44.167
Now ask yourself,
"Where does the water go?"

10:44.250 --> 10:46.375
Wild stab here. Down?

10:46.458 --> 10:47.500
Nailed it, Chef!

10:47.583 --> 10:49.417
Down a master sewage pipe.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.167
One that, no doubt, empties
far away from here.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.792
So, we just need to gain access
to said pipe,

10:54.875 --> 10:58.333
and we will soon breathe
the fresh air of freedom.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.542
I do believe
that's a sarcastic slow clap, sir.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.000
On the contrary, troll.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.792
I love it!

11:06.875 --> 11:11.208
Kaos, since you are obviously
an evil mastermind like the rest of us,

11:11.292 --> 11:15.375
how would you like to hear about
our secret escape plan?

11:15.458 --> 11:17.333
Oh, I...

11:17.417 --> 11:19.042
I would love nothing more,
My Queen.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.833
Beautiful. Now, listen close.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.917
Cell check!
Prisoner, step aside.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.458
Oh... oh, hi, there.

11:25.542 --> 11:28.167
Yeah, look, I'm so sorry.
Someone left this in our cell!

11:28.250 --> 11:30.625
And I was totally about to
give it to you,

11:30.708 --> 11:31.958
in the face!

11:32.708 --> 11:34.625
To the hole!

11:36.375 --> 11:37.958
Hey, guard, hungry?

11:38.042 --> 11:39.083
Munch on this!

11:40.083 --> 11:42.167
-Terrific.
-You need a time-out, Chef.

11:42.250 --> 11:43.542
You gonna freeze me, guard?

11:43.625 --> 11:45.833
Ooh, I'm so scared. Ooh!

11:45.917 --> 11:47.958
-All right, you asked for it.
-I sure did.

11:48.667 --> 11:49.833
To the hole!

11:50.875 --> 11:52.208
Riot!

11:53.208 --> 11:55.083
Cease and desist, Dreamcatcher!

11:55.167 --> 11:57.208
You're not the boss of me!

11:57.292 --> 11:59.833
Am too. See? Badge.

12:02.375 --> 12:03.750
To the hole!

12:05.750 --> 12:08.458
Geez, what is up with the inmates?

12:08.542 --> 12:10.917
What's the meaning of this?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.875
Just using my sweet bone harp
to entrance my fellow inmates

12:13.958 --> 12:15.792
so they'll do whatever I say.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.625
Huh. That doesn't sound so bad.

12:17.708 --> 12:19.208
Oh, it's not.

12:19.292 --> 12:20.708
But the part where I say,

12:20.792 --> 12:24.917
"Attack that lunk-headed lava punk,"
has real potential.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.208
Attack that lunk-headed lava punk!

12:27.875 --> 12:31.458
You can't turn inmates
into mindless drones.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.042
To the hole!

12:36.208 --> 12:38.458
So, you guys had to send prisoners
to the hole too?

12:38.542 --> 12:41.000
Yep. They were all seriously
out of control.

12:41.083 --> 12:45.625
So weird, seeing how Snap Shot said
how tame this place usually is.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.083
Inmate doing nothing,
no contraband visible.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.167
Great. And I'll just brush my teeth
in front of you

12:51.250 --> 12:53.875
with this innocent-looking toothbrush.

12:53.958 --> 12:56.083
These bristles are not regulation.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.000
Uh, that's not a violation, Spyro.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.917
It's not? Oh, okay.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.458
Come closer,
open your mouths.

13:05.542 --> 13:09.417
Did you know broccoli is bad for you?

13:09.500 --> 13:12.667
Attempted assault by a healthy side dish?
To the hole!

13:12.750 --> 13:16.208
I'm a bad boy.

13:16.292 --> 13:19.875
Well, well, well,
aren't you all just so tough?

13:19.958 --> 13:21.625
We're Skylanders, inmate.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.042
And you'd be wise
not to get on our bad side.

13:26.583 --> 13:29.583
"Skylanders," please. Oh, my.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.125
You're here for one day.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.667
You three snot-nosed rookies

13:32.750 --> 13:36.208
can't intimidate the most dangerous
villain in this entire prison.

13:36.292 --> 13:37.708
Are you trying to get sent to the hole?

13:37.792 --> 13:39.500
Do you think that worries me
in the slightest?

13:39.583 --> 13:43.250
I am the Golden Queen.
I rule this place.

13:43.333 --> 13:46.083
And as soon as my Doom Raiders
and I are free again,

13:46.167 --> 13:47.625
I'll rule all of you too,

13:47.708 --> 13:50.750
turning you into golden trophies
forevermore.

13:53.167 --> 13:54.625
That's it, lady!

13:54.708 --> 13:55.792
-To...
-The...

13:55.875 --> 13:58.042
-Hole!
-Down the hatch.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.042
Now what?

14:00.125 --> 14:02.250
That's the prison lock-down siren.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.875
Let's go!

14:03.958 --> 14:06.167
Stay back, or the guard gets it!

14:06.250 --> 14:08.542
Easy, Kaos. Easy.

14:08.625 --> 14:11.250
This only ends one way for you.
Badly.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.000
Not this time, Skydorks.

14:13.083 --> 14:16.167
You see, I'm now in
with the Golden Queen and her gang,

14:16.250 --> 14:17.917
which means we run this place.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.250
Good luck with that.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.917
They're all in the hole together
spending quality time

14:22.000 --> 14:24.125
thinking about their poor life choices.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.875
But... but, but, wait...

14:25.958 --> 14:28.458
They were supposed to meet me here
after I took this guard hostage

14:28.542 --> 14:29.750
and sounded the alarm.

14:29.833 --> 14:32.083
Change of plans, fat head.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.250
-Can you send me there too?
-You got it.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.000
-You okay, pal?
-I think so.

14:39.083 --> 14:43.208
Um... did you say you sent
all the Doom Raiders to the hole?

14:43.292 --> 14:46.167
Yeah, why?
Is that a problem?

14:46.250 --> 14:48.042
Uh...

14:52.250 --> 14:55.125
Kaos? What are you doing here?

14:55.208 --> 14:58.125
Well, I was doing just what you
asked of me, your Queen-ness,

14:58.208 --> 15:00.667
by taking that guard
hostage in the cafeteria.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.125
But then the Skylanders showed up

15:02.208 --> 15:04.792
and they were able to somehow
foil my plan.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.792
Oh, well, better luck next time,
am I right?

15:07.375 --> 15:09.417
So, what's the haps here?

15:09.500 --> 15:11.000
Oh, you fool!

15:11.083 --> 15:14.708
I needed you to stay in that cafeteria
for as long as possible

15:14.792 --> 15:17.458
while we enacted our escape plan.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.667
But I thought I was going to be
part of that plan.

15:19.750 --> 15:24.792
Oh, you were. As the decoy who keeps
the guards busy while we get away.

15:24.875 --> 15:26.625
The Queen's idea
was to get those new guards

15:26.708 --> 15:28.000
to send us all to the hole.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.667
This is the only place
where no one can see us or stop us.

15:30.750 --> 15:34.125
And now we can put
the real escape plan into motion.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.250
Which is what?

15:35.333 --> 15:38.042
We will combine
all of our evil powers at the same time

15:38.125 --> 15:40.792
into a concentrated blast of dark energy

15:40.875 --> 15:43.458
that can rip through
the very fabric of reality

15:43.542 --> 15:45.917
to create an inter-dimensional hole.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.208
A hole through which we can finally
tunnel our way to freedom.

15:50.292 --> 15:51.458
A wormhole.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.167
Doom Raiders?

15:53.250 --> 15:55.125
X marks the spot.

15:55.708 --> 15:56.708
Attack!

15:56.792 --> 15:58.917
Put your backs into it.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.583
It's happening.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.542
Space and time are being torn asunder

16:05.625 --> 16:08.667
and our gateway to freedom is upon us.

16:08.750 --> 16:09.833
How are you helping out?

16:09.917 --> 16:13.542
Well, my true super power
is the ability to heal.

16:13.625 --> 16:15.083
But in a situation like this,

16:15.167 --> 16:18.167
my role is served best
as the gang's support system.

16:20.292 --> 16:22.292
Go, team, go!

16:22.375 --> 16:25.750
Doom Raiders rule!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.250
Please, Queen.
Take me with you.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.458
I can't remain here amongst
common thugs and riffraff.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.958
Besides, I...

16:37.042 --> 16:38.875
I thought we had something.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.583
What was that?
I can't hear you

16:40.667 --> 16:43.458
over all my not wanting to listen
to anything you have to say.

16:43.542 --> 16:45.875
Well,
I guess you don't want to know

16:45.958 --> 16:48.292
where the map to the Core of Light
is then, eh?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.792
Because that is something I totally know.

16:50.875 --> 16:54.333
You see, I thought we could get the map
and destroy the Core together,

16:54.417 --> 16:56.417
along with the rest of the Skylands.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.833
You know,
a very casual first date?

16:58.917 --> 17:02.083
The Core of Light you say?

17:02.167 --> 17:04.083
Oh, Kaos,

17:04.166 --> 17:06.291
I was just teasing you before.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.833
You know, playing hard to get, as it were.
You know what I mean.

17:08.916 --> 17:10.375
I truly have no clue.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.625
So... that, uh... map?

17:12.708 --> 17:15.041
Uh...
where did you say it was?

17:15.125 --> 17:16.916
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.541
I'm not just going to give that
information away.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.958
-Not unless you take me with you.
-Of course.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.916
Nothing would please me more.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.333
Oh, may I?

17:31.167 --> 17:32.917
You did what?

17:33.000 --> 17:37.083
You can't send more than one inmate
to the hole at a time!

17:37.167 --> 17:39.458
They can use their powers
together down there!

17:39.542 --> 17:40.708
Did I not tell you that?

17:40.792 --> 17:43.042
I mean, it feels
like something so important

17:43.125 --> 17:44.792
that we wouldn't have forgot, so...

17:44.875 --> 17:46.958
I'm slipping in my old age.

17:47.042 --> 17:48.500
I've been on this job so long,

17:48.583 --> 17:51.292
I didn't think to reinforce
the danger of the hole.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.208
I mean, it's not even in the rule books

17:53.292 --> 17:55.292
because it's just something
that every guard knows!

17:55.375 --> 17:57.458
Sorry, Snap Shot.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.292
We were just trying to do a good job.

17:59.375 --> 18:02.708
Guess we let our nerves about
not messing up get the best of us.

18:02.792 --> 18:06.542
I need to gather up all the guards
and get down to the hole ASAP,

18:06.625 --> 18:10.542
to stop those convicts before we have
a real situation on our hands!

18:11.458 --> 18:13.458
Guys, we made this mess.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.667
Now, let's get down there
and clean it up.

18:15.750 --> 18:17.542
- To the hole?
- To the hole!

18:17.625 --> 18:19.667
Skylanders unite!

18:21.583 --> 18:22.875
The hole.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.792
And that hole.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.875
Skylanders?

18:26.958 --> 18:28.042
Destroy them!

18:32.250 --> 18:34.583
Ah! It's so pretty and...

18:34.667 --> 18:36.708
and painful!

18:36.792 --> 18:38.792
Pretty painful!

18:42.792 --> 18:44.542
No! Not my bone harp!

18:44.625 --> 18:46.958
Everyone, take out those fools!

19:01.042 --> 19:04.250
-Queen, look! The wormhole.
-Let's move!

19:05.625 --> 19:06.917
How are we gonna stop them?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.417
Guys! Your badges.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.042
Maybe we can aim them at the wormhole,
tap once,

19:11.125 --> 19:12.708
and freeze it before they escape.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.917
-Worth a shot.
-Tap on the count of three.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.458
One, two--

19:16.542 --> 19:18.708
- I forgot what comes after two.
- Three!

19:22.250 --> 19:24.042
Seriously, with this? Ow!

19:24.125 --> 19:26.792
Kaos is stuck.
Come on, guys.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.667
No. Unhand my head!

19:29.750 --> 19:31.625
Doom Raiders!
Please, help me!

19:33.583 --> 19:35.750
Sorry, mama's boy,
but we gots to go.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
No!

19:41.083 --> 19:42.917
What's happening, Skylanders?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.583
The Doom Raiders used their powers

19:44.667 --> 19:46.708
to create a wormhole
that they escaped through.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.750
We tried to stop them
before they got away, but...

19:48.833 --> 19:51.083
there were just
too many of 'em.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.500
And by the time we were able

19:52.583 --> 19:55.625
to freeze the wormhole itself
to close it up, well,

19:55.708 --> 19:57.792
they were already on the other side.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.333
Wait. Not everyone got away.

19:59.917 --> 20:02.583
There's one big-headed jerk
who got spit out by the wormhole

20:02.667 --> 20:03.833
and back into the prison.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.208
And he's right...
here?

20:08.042 --> 20:10.917
Looks like Kaos
escaped through the sewage pipe.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.833
Some prefer a beurre blanc,
while others are béarnaise folks,

20:18.917 --> 20:20.417
but I say why limit yourself?

20:20.500 --> 20:23.375
Let the cuisine have a voice.
Am I right? Huh?

20:23.458 --> 20:24.542
Good talk.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.833
I have to go shiv the guy
who confiscated my pruno.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.750
It's gelato made from prunes.

20:30.667 --> 20:34.000
Oh, Glumshanks!

20:34.083 --> 20:35.833
Nearest sewer pipe?

20:35.917 --> 20:40.042
I can't believe he actually used
the stupid sewer pipe plan.

20:40.125 --> 20:42.333
Coming, sir.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.875
Mmm.

20:47.625 --> 20:51.083
It's been years
since any prisoner tried to escape.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.458
But with all the recent unrest
in the prison,

20:53.542 --> 20:56.458
I should've known someone would try
something like this one day.

20:56.542 --> 20:59.792
The Doom Raiders totally
took advantage of us

20:59.875 --> 21:03.292
and we took their bait,
hook, line and sinker.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.667
Yes, you did!

21:05.750 --> 21:09.417
No, this is my fault, Skylanders.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.542
-Should we go after 'em, Snap Shot?
-They could be anywhere, Spyro.

21:12.625 --> 21:16.625
All you can do now is be ready
when you return to the Skylander Academy.

21:16.708 --> 21:20.292
Because, if you thought the Doom Raiders
were a handful today,

21:20.375 --> 21:22.542
you haven't seen anything yet.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.542
They may have preyed
on our inexperience today,

21:25.625 --> 21:26.875
but it won't happen again.

21:26.958 --> 21:28.333
We'll make this right.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.500
No matter how long it takes.

21:30.583 --> 21:33.792
Um... excuse me?
I didn't escape.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.542
Points for being a model inmate,
am I right?

21:36.625 --> 21:37.625
Eh?

21:37.708 --> 21:40.042
Can I go back to my cell now?
