00:26.280 --> 00:30.080
[sighs] And, of course, dessert.
Can't have dinner without dessert.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.480
-You can.
-What?

00:31.560 --> 00:33.280
-It is possible to have dinner without--
-It's just a saying.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.120
Yes, maybe she didn't know,
that's why I'm saying it.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.760
Oh! Mm. Tasty!

00:41.000 --> 00:44.720
-Um... So, I'm just gonna wash up.
-Don't be stupid, you're our guest.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.120
No, I'm not being stupid.
I've just gotta do the dishes.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.000
Tracey's culture is African.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.040
African, yes, yes.
Yes, I know, you've said it.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.520
-Tracey's African.
-[Tracey clears throat]

00:55.440 --> 00:57.840
[mouthing]

00:57.920 --> 01:00.400
Okay, you two are doing
that mysterious miming thing again.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.000
Sorry, it's just habit, because...
I have to go, but I don't wanna be rude.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.720
I feel like the miming
thing is way ruder, Trace.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.520
Tracey.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.080
Okay, look, let's be adult about this.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.400
I mean, the three of us
could actually be really great friends.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.200
Cool. Well, guys! [chuckles]

01:21.680 --> 01:24.160
High fives, up top.
Go, team! Yeah, you too.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.320
One, two, go, go, go, go, go, go away.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.560
[theme music plays]

01:50.360 --> 01:52.320
I will trust you, Lord!

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
Amen.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.600
I believe in God,
and God, he believes in me.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.000
[announcer] <i>God rocks!</i>

01:59.160 --> 02:03.240
Traumatizing. Honestly,
how can you conduct a service

02:03.320 --> 02:06.320
on the power of yoga and meditation?

02:06.480 --> 02:08.720
-[preacher] <i>Praise be to Jesus!</i>
-[audience applauds]

02:08.800 --> 02:10.040
[hiccups]

02:11.000 --> 02:13.760
-Hiccup. I had a hiccup.
-What, you just had it that one time?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.280
-Yeah.
-Nah, there's no such thing.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.240
You don't get a hiccup,
you get the hiccups

02:17.320 --> 02:18.480
or you get called "dumb", Cynthia.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.960
And you get sexually
transmitted infections.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.120
-Excuse me?
-Vaginitis.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.200
-I've never even had that.
-'Cause it's smelly and...

02:24.280 --> 02:25.600
Look, you're dumb, you don't
wash down there...

02:25.680 --> 02:28.320
-[indistinct shouting]
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Ey!

02:30.240 --> 02:32.240
My mum's looking for another
space to turn into a church.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.360
At first I was like,
"Mum, why can't you just sit in the pew,

02:34.440 --> 02:36.800
you haven't even read the whole <i>Bible."</i>
But I had to accept it.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.440
My mum loves to lead.
She just loves it.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.040
And it's all about what you love, innit?

02:41.360 --> 02:45.200
Right now, I am loving the idea of a dog.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.160
Look, they don't care
about your personality,

02:48.240 --> 02:50.760
they don't care about your looks,
and they will never abandon you,

02:50.840 --> 02:53.920
as long as you don't run out of food.
[squeals] Look!

02:54.000 --> 02:56.360
Look at this one.
Meep. Meep. Meep.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.800
The one and only thing I will take

02:57.880 --> 03:00.720
from that apparent
church is loving nature.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.000
They encourage that,
to adore all God's creation,

03:04.280 --> 03:05.520
not just each other.

03:06.040 --> 03:10.640
To love the sky, the plants,
the tigers, the cockroach.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.320
Mummy, a dog, the dog.
We can get a dog then?

03:13.400 --> 03:15.600
No, no, no.
But I will allow you now to go to the zoo.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.680
You wouldn't have to
take care of it, Mummy.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
-I would do everything myself.
-Nu-uh-uh.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.560
You can't take care of yourself.
How can you a dog?

03:19.680 --> 03:21.960
-Mummy, please, can we have a--
-No dog!

03:22.320 --> 03:25.480
-We already have a dog. Mm.
-Oh, shut up! Shut up!

03:25.560 --> 03:28.320
-Mummy, look. Please, please, please--
-If you open your mouth--

03:28.400 --> 03:31.760
Yes, Tracey, stop barking.
[barks]

03:31.840 --> 03:33.280
Cynthia!

03:33.520 --> 03:34.640
Ay!

03:35.960 --> 03:39.520
Oh, these children!
You can't even give me one minute's peace.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.680
-[spits]
-[squeals]

03:41.440 --> 03:43.240
Sex is what the internet was made for,

03:43.440 --> 03:47.480
and you want a dick, you want some sex,
now that is free.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.840
-Preach.
-Well, all right, let's check it out.

03:50.280 --> 03:54.200
3zup, 2zup, any up app,
whatever, sign me up.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.480
I'll prove to you that sex don't zap

03:56.560 --> 03:59.520
from the screen to the
scene for all of us.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.800
Look, babe, if you're unlucky with guys,
you're unlucky with guys.

04:02.920 --> 04:06.480
Oi! I get men,
just I get men in reality.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.600
The internet is fickle.
You base a whole person on a 2D--

04:09.680 --> 04:14.600
No, no, enough of the fucking politics.
Here, download it, let's do it.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.680
Esther's right.
Esther's always right, Mandy.

04:17.760 --> 04:20.000
Nan, your phone's
like from caveman times.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.760
Oi, Nan, I've already proved it.
Look at this site, yeah?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.840
Loan-A-Pup.com.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.360
Dog owners, they need babysitters
to look after their dogs,

04:27.440 --> 04:28.800
because they've got
rich people things to do

04:28.880 --> 04:31.080
and no real friends to help them,
and I'm gonna do it.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.440
What?

04:34.520 --> 04:36.400
Trace, no one's gonna
trust you with a dog.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.520
-Is it?
-Have you ever even owned a dog?

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
Is it?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.120
Nan, it's done.
See if anyone swipes ya.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.640
Anyone? This face would give you a
fuckin' run for your money.

Look, all these people want
to borrow me their dogs.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.480
Or want me to borrow their...
No, it doesn't matter,

05:30.560 --> 05:32.080
because now I can be selective.

What size do I want?

done this sort of thing before.

Mm.

-Whose Facebook was signed on?
-It said, "Authorize through Facebook",

06:23.040 --> 06:24.680
not "Authorize through Esther's Facebook."

06:24.800 --> 06:26.680
It's all right,
it's not even a clear picture.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.960

he won't know the difference.

He's so cute.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.160
No, no, no, no, no, no, come on.
Sorry about that.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.480
-Sorry about that.
-Yeah.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.800
How come you don't have
any pictures of Orlando?

07:48.880 --> 07:50.600
Oh, you know,
just can't get him to stay still

07:50.680 --> 07:53.080
-in front of the camera.
-Oh, that's a shame.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.440
It's a shame. It is a shame.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.520
You know, I like it,
I like him, I like you.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.640
-Oh!
-What do I need to know?

07:59.720 --> 08:00.760
Well, he's just been fed,

08:00.840 --> 08:03.200
so he won't need feeding
again for another six hours.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.920
Erm... Now, he's a very friendly dog,
but he will bark at other dogs,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
so you make sure you hold on
to that leash nice and tight.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.280
Oh, yes, sir. [chuckles]

08:09.360 --> 08:13.520
Oh, yes, this...
This is Noah. It's his favourite toy.

-So you just give this a little squeeze...
-[Noah squeaks]

08:15.360 --> 08:17.440
[chuckles] No matter what's going on,
he'll run straight to you.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.640
Ah. It's a very, very powerful toy, Lance.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.400
Noah is the power, Tracey.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.760
[laughing]

08:23.840 --> 08:25.600
Like you. Okay.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.080
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.600
Come on, Orlando, my new friend.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.240
What kind of God would create rules?

08:37.080 --> 08:38.680
Not the God that we serve.

What kind of God would love
one of his creations and not the other?

08:43.360 --> 08:46.600
Hating you if you're bad,
loving you if you're good?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.160

shit kinda God, am I right?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.400
We're all going to Heaven.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.520
But whilst we're here on Earth,
let's listen to our hearts...

09:03.360 --> 09:04.760
and let's chase our dreams.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.800
[cheering and applause]

09:06.880 --> 09:08.920
Amen! Amen!

09:09.000 --> 09:12.480
You are preaching blasphemy
and I will have the blood

09:12.560 --> 09:16.760
of this entire church
on my hands if I do not speak!

09:17.200 --> 09:20.720
Please, sister, do.
We encourage an open dialogue here.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.760
What you encourage is sin.
You are a liar!

09:24.960 --> 09:29.120
You have to do good things
and not sin to get to Heaven.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.640
I used to be like you.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.040
First, your legs wide open,
and then arms,

09:33.120 --> 09:34.760
no to both, thank you.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.840
And if you're pregnant
before you're married,

09:36.920 --> 09:38.400
you should be sat at the back,

09:38.720 --> 09:42.240
not over there with God, because my--
[sobs]

09:42.320 --> 09:48.320
It's okay, Cynthia, it's all right.
Come on, come with me, it's all right.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.120
[sobbing]

09:54.200 --> 09:55.720

09:55.800 --> 09:56.920
[preacher] Amen, brother.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.960
Amen.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.040
Good boy, aren't you good?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.600
Did you have a nice time in the park?

10:14.040 --> 10:16.680
Maybe I'll give you a little,
little treat, huh?

10:16.760 --> 10:18.560
Why do I know that bloody dog?

10:18.680 --> 10:21.200
My dog is not bloody,
this dog don't have no period.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.680
And second of all,
all dogs look like this, Mandy.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.320
Have you not noticed, though,
Orlando and me, we're the same colour.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.280
Exactly the same colour.
He's basically like my son.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.840
This is gonna drive me mad.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.520
-Where do I know ya from?
-Hey, stop scaring Orlando.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.240
-It's a fucking dog, get over yourself.
-No, I won't.

10:37.160 --> 10:41.000
-All right, that'll do. Mm-hm.
-That'll do?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.360
You better have me looking
glitz and glamour

10:42.440 --> 10:44.000
or I will knock your lights out.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.360
All right, Nan, finishing touches.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.200
-Okay, Ola, mirror.
-Are you sure?

10:51.360 --> 10:52.560
Show me the fucking mirror.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.920
-Oh, quite nice.
-[Mandy] Yeah?

10:59.640 --> 11:03.720
No, I look fucking awful!
I look like a fucking gypsy princess.

11:03.800 --> 11:04.800
What have you done?

11:04.880 --> 11:07.480
I'm questioning our friendship,
Mandy, I really am.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.120
Nan, you look great.
We're practically twins.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.840
Well, he said he'd have
a blue handkerchief,

11:11.920 --> 11:13.560
what am I supposed to tell him?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.960
"Look out for the council
estate drag queen"?

11:18.920 --> 11:20.520
Stop staring at him!

11:20.880 --> 11:24.120
Oh, come on, let's get
away from this nasty lady.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.320
Mandy, stop it!

11:28.160 --> 11:30.880
I was a complete shambles
on our wedding day.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.800
I tore the whole marquee to pieces.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.120
[screams]

11:36.720 --> 11:38.440
I threw <i>The Bible </i>on the floor.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.800
Joy must have had a lot of
cleaning up to do after that.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.960
-I'm sorry.
-I came here for some kind of closure,

11:44.160 --> 11:46.720
but I didn't know that
until this conversation.

11:48.280 --> 11:52.600
I've been kind of struggling
with my sexuality.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.080
You're a lesbian?

11:55.920 --> 11:57.920
No, I'm struggling with my sexuality.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
What other kind of struggle
is worth talking about?

12:00.080 --> 12:03.200
Being a virgin,
not wanting to be a virgin,

12:03.480 --> 12:05.400
not knowing why I can't
just meet someone and...

12:07.440 --> 12:11.000
But things are a little bit
clearer now you've apologized.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.760
-I didn't apologize.
-You said "sorry".

12:15.840 --> 12:17.040
For tearing down the marquee.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.800
-No, Ronald.
-Let me articulate this truthfully.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.240
I'm sorry that I put your
mother through the cardio

12:25.320 --> 12:26.720
of tidying up the shattered marquee,

12:26.840 --> 12:29.360
when cardio is clearly not
a thing she's familiar with,

12:29.640 --> 12:32.760
due to being morbidly obese
and unable to step foot in a gym,

12:32.840 --> 12:34.880
as she'd be an eye sore there.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.080
I believe and know...
that you owe me an apology.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.800
I love you as my sister in Christ,
but how could I feel sorry?

12:43.120 --> 12:46.320
Your life is of no importance to me,
it's impossible to feel sorriness.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.480
But thank you, you were a footnote,
I suppose, in my journey...

12:49.640 --> 12:51.040
-[door opens]
-...toward being a full-on homo.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.800
I won't be long, honey.

12:55.200 --> 12:58.200
Cynthia, this is my boyfriend, Cleveland.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.000
Are you feeling any better?

13:01.560 --> 13:04.280
Enough. Enough talking.

13:11.120 --> 13:14.280
-[chuckles]
-Me, enough? You, enough.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.760
-I love you.
-Excellent.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.760
Sorry, where were we?

13:33.960 --> 13:35.400
That's him, that's Bobby.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.760
God, he'd be worth a fuck-and-a-half.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.560
You go, I'll be fine.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.760
Nan?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.240
What the actual fuck?

13:50.720 --> 13:54.760
Oh, yeah, I know, right? I told her
that it's totes inapropes, yeah?

13:57.840 --> 14:00.840
-Here we are, madam.
-Candice, lovely to meet ya.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.360
Oh, yes, lovely to meet you, too.
[chuckles]

14:05.120 --> 14:07.480
-It's your menu, sir.
-Thank you.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.520
[Tracey] I took him to the street,
I took him to the park,

14:17.640 --> 14:21.200
I fed him-- Oh, I let him feed me.
And I got him doing bare tricks, you know,

14:21.280 --> 14:23.920
just like that, bare tricks.
I let him meet all my friends.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.640
Yeah, I even let him lick my face.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.800
Like, I didn't think I would
ever let him do that, ever.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.200
Oh, well, it's not
for everyone, I suppose.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.040
[Tracey squeals] No!

14:33.360 --> 14:34.480
Do you mind?

14:34.560 --> 14:36.640
It's just that I think
you might be his muse.

14:36.720 --> 14:39.120
-Shall we, um... Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.040
-Yeah?
-Okay.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.040
Yeah, now you come and stand next to me.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.760
You might be able to get him
to stay in front of the camera.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.080
Yeah, I probably could, to be fair.
It's like me and this guy go way back.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.680
-Yeah.
-What do I do, just tell him to stay?

14:49.800 --> 14:52.560
-Yeah.
-Yo, stay, stay.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.640
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Stay, stay.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.560
-Stay, stay, stay.
-[camera shutter clicks]

14:57.640 --> 14:58.720
See, look, look, he's proper staying.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.560
-Yeah, yeah.
-Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.400
Oh, look, look at that.
That is superb.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.040
Do you want some with him?

15:07.120 --> 15:08.400
Er... Yeah!

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
[laughing]

15:12.720 --> 15:15.800
That's it. Arm up. Yes. Yep. Now smile.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.800
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Yes!

15:21.000 --> 15:24.120
-[Bobby] I'm having a lovely time.
-Me, too.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.400
I don't know what to have.
What are you having, Bobby?

15:27.480 --> 15:30.200
Tell you what, Candice,
you choose for me.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.320
-Are you ready to order?
-Just give me one more moment.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.560
I think we'll have a tomato
and mozzarella salad for two.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.880
-Perfect. Perfect.
-That's great.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.000
Thank you very much.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.160
[menu rustles]

15:49.040 --> 15:50.080
[mouths]

15:50.440 --> 15:52.040
[chuckles awkwardly]

15:52.120 --> 15:53.240
You're gorgeous, you know?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.240
Really?

15:56.360 --> 15:58.560
Yeah, just like I imagined you'd be.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
Thanks.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.000
[Lance] Yes, yes.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.520
-Uh-huh.
-[Tracey gasps]

16:07.000 --> 16:08.720
These lights are a mad ting, Lance.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.640
Yeah, you are sweating.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.040
Ooh. No wonder he don't stay
in front of the camera, it's too hot.

16:14.120 --> 16:15.760
Yeah, it's ruining the shots.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.400
Sorry, I'm boiling.
I'm gonna take this off.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.840
Yeah, let's just do underwear.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.920
Do underwear?

16:25.640 --> 16:27.880
As in, that's what I wear while you
proceed to take these pictures?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.760
[scoffs] Mate.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.680
No, wait, wait, I mean, I'm gay.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.640
-Real talk?
-Mm-hm.

16:37.080 --> 16:41.800
Now, I thought me and you had like a...
Okay, cool. Shame. Underwear it is.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.440
Underwear. [chuckles]

16:43.920 --> 16:48.720
Orlando, see, "Oral", "Oral-ando".
I knew I knew that dog.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.200
-[moaning on laptop]
-[groans]

16:51.920 --> 16:54.360
-Mandy!
-What? I've seen worse.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.760
[groaning]

16:57.840 --> 16:59.160
[camera shutter clicks]

16:59.800 --> 17:02.000
Drop the mask, Tracey.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.560
All right, now look, you
are a beautiful girl,

17:03.640 --> 17:05.960
don't be afraid of your own sexiness
just 'cause Orlando is there.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.320
Now, look, I dare you to relax.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.960
Dare you to free yourself.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.440
That's it, yeah.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.080
-[camera shutter clicks]
-That's it.

17:15.160 --> 17:21.080
Yeah, now, look, why don't
you just let him get in there...

17:21.360 --> 17:24.280
just a little? Yeah, yeah, yeah?

17:26.240 --> 17:30.200
Um... I'm gonna... I'm gonna
put my clothes on now.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.360
Hmm?

17:33.680 --> 17:36.440
-I'm gonna put my clothes on now.
-[sighs]

17:37.800 --> 17:38.800
Is...

17:39.880 --> 17:42.920
-Is that legal?
-No, but what is?

17:43.360 --> 17:45.120
I mean, one day the
government will legalize it

17:45.200 --> 17:46.920
just so they can steal
all the profit out of it,

17:47.000 --> 17:51.160
and until they do I will continue
living my life like this.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.360
Big market on the fetish scene for it.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.720
It can be a bit hit and
miss with Loan-A-Pup girls,

17:56.800 --> 17:59.280
but you know what?
I like the authenticity...

18:00.680 --> 18:03.200
[Lance] Fuck! Orlando!
Tracey!

18:04.040 --> 18:05.960
Just 'cause he drinks
water from the toilet bowl,

18:06.040 --> 18:09.040
and he eats food from the floor,
and he doesn't mind putting his nose

18:09.120 --> 18:12.520
up another dog's bum-bum,
it doesn't mean you can make him do that.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.640
You know, I just think,
it's a sad, sad world.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.720
If you're gonna sit here, stop whining.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.720
[Cynthia] <i>You're not</i>
<i>leaving until you apologize.</i>

18:33.080 --> 18:35.280
-Get out of my way.
-You haven't changed.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.560
If you're trying to
provoke me to touch you,

18:36.680 --> 18:39.560
-I'm afraid I won't.
-You can't stop hurting people.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.520
I'm surprised they don't despise you.

18:41.600 --> 18:46.720
Oh, they do.
I sleep with Cleveland, Sam,

18:47.360 --> 18:51.040
John, Paul, and Gaultier.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.320
But it's not biblical to judge or hate.

18:54.440 --> 18:58.480
Furthermore, no one will tell Cleveland.
I'll do as I please.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.720
Yes, you do as you please,
as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

19:03.040 --> 19:06.640
That's where you're wrong,
that's where you're...

19:07.200 --> 19:09.560
you're... You're too close.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.720
The sin is not having sex.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.920
The sin is hurting people.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.600
I can... I can do what I want.

19:20.120 --> 19:24.120
I could wear short skirts,
I can kiss someone,

19:24.400 --> 19:28.040
as long as I'm not causing pain.
[whispers] Oh, my God.

19:28.240 --> 19:33.760
But a kiss from a gorilla
is surely painful to anyone, Cynthzilla.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.280
Get out of my life.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.200
[mutters silently]

19:48.080 --> 19:49.080
Hi, Cynthia.

19:49.880 --> 19:55.000
Cleveland... So, how did
you and Ronald find love?

19:56.080 --> 19:59.440
Come on, you deserve to know the truth.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.440
Can you just give me two seconds?

20:05.080 --> 20:08.320
-Ooh, I could do with a top up.
-Yeah, the service in here, honestly.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.080
-[snaps fingers]
-Is everything okay, sir?

20:11.440 --> 20:12.920
Yeah, can we get the lady a top up?

20:15.720 --> 20:18.280
I like you, you're demanding.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.360
[glass shattering]

20:20.440 --> 20:21.840
-Shit!
-For fuck's sake.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.280
You blind or something?

20:23.960 --> 20:26.400
-I am, actually.
-What?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.840
I just thank God Rocks
for bringing us together.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.320
He's, he's my only friend.
No one's friendly here.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.680
It's... been, been, been really hard.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.400
Cleveland, I think you're lovely...

20:42.240 --> 20:43.600
and you deserve the world,

20:44.120 --> 20:47.000
which is probably more than
what the world decides to give you.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.040
No, that's the bathroom.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.920
[sniffing and sighing]

20:59.560 --> 21:01.480
-Oh, no.
-Oh, hey!

21:01.720 --> 21:02.720
Are you feeling better?

21:04.160 --> 21:07.560
Can we discuss this when I've finished?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.080
[Cynthia] Shall we go to Cheesy Eaters?

21:17.240 --> 21:20.960
-Why the fuck didn't you say something?
-People judge ya, especially women.

21:21.160 --> 21:24.120
A blind guy just isn't an option,
it's not even an option you can consider.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.000
So what do you look like?

21:28.720 --> 21:33.560
Mixed race, a caramel sort of tone.
Occasionally, I model.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.880
I don't care, it's your voice,

21:36.200 --> 21:38.520
the raspiness, it's affecting.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.880
Well, when I first saw you, I said,

21:43.000 --> 21:46.320
I reckon that you were definitely
worth a shag-and-a-half.

21:46.400 --> 21:51.160
Now... I'd say that you're
probably worth at least two.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.520
[chuckling]

21:52.640 --> 21:56.800
[moans]

22:01.200 --> 22:04.000
[Tracey] I'll always love you, okay?

22:04.960 --> 22:07.680
And I'll visit ya... every day.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.360
Never lick my face again, okay?

22:10.880 --> 22:13.920
From now on, Orlando,
it's about your future...

22:15.440 --> 22:17.720
-it's not about your past.
-[Mandy] Take a selfie.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.840
-No, stop, stop!
-[camera shutter clicks]

22:21.280 --> 22:24.760
Oh, gosh! This estate is no place for you.

22:25.520 --> 22:26.600
It's time to go.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.320
-Are you sure?
-I promise you.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.520
-And I can visit?
-Of course.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.600
Every day if I want to?

22:32.760 --> 22:35.440
Yeah, if you really wanted to,
it's possible.

22:35.560 --> 22:37.560
Okay, I wasn't really
talking to you at all, but it's cool.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.240
My grandma literally raised me.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.240
I promise you she'll
take good care of him.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.160
Oh, I'm glad she has great
experience in raising dogs.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.560
-Sorry.
-One thing I will say before you go,

22:51.640 --> 22:52.840
keep him away from her vagina.

22:53.360 --> 22:57.000
-What?
-"Vagina", she said "vagina".

22:58.040 --> 22:58.880
Er...

22:59.120 --> 23:01.840
[theme music plays]
