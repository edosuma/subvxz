00:03.100 --> 00:04.600
I'm in trouble, Harry.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.200
What? Okay, I'm coming over.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.100
No, no. Not, not there.

00:08.100 --> 00:11.500
- Where? 
- That, that hike we went on,
when you pulled your calf muscle.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
- Kim, it's Harriet. Hum...

00:13.500 --> 00:17.700
- Can you call me when you get this? 
'Cause I'm, I'm starting to get kinda worried.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.800
I know we're all shocked 
and saddened by the sudden loss

00:21.800 --> 00:24.000
of our colleague and friend.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.200
- I want to know the truth, Het.
I'm not gonna get it from them.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.800
But I am gonna find out what happened.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.700
Hello?

00:31.700 --> 00:33.500
I'm sorry, I'm Charles Dancer.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
- ASIO? - Does it show?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
- Harry, listen.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
- Remember the shared house?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
- You were right.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.600
Kim left it for me. 
It's, it's some sort of message,

00:45.600 --> 00:47.400
but I just can't work it out.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.400
I wanna do this. 
Who else are you gonna get?

00:49.700 --> 00:51.000
I need cash, Gus.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.700
For an air gapped computer, 
a new phone, a safe house,

00:53.700 --> 00:55.600
and some pretty heavy decryption software.

00:55.600 --> 00:56.900
I can't authorize that.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.900
I need you to hold on to the SIM.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.900
- What SIM? 
- Max Dalgety's.

01:01.500 --> 01:04.300
- Tell me about your 
friends in the Choir.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.600
The ones that helped 
you organize your protest.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.600
I can't.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.900
- Did Sabine have any involvement
 with dissident groups?

01:11.900 --> 01:14.600
- Cassie, did you and Kevin 
know the boy from the lake?

01:14.600 --> 01:16.500
Max was like Kevin's twin brother.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.300
- What do you think they were doing? 
- I'm guessing it's something Darknet.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.200
- Something illegal? 
- Is Kevin in some sort of trouble?

01:22.500 --> 01:25.700
- We can't take a haphazard
 approach to Intelligence.

01:25.700 --> 01:30.000
- Safer Australia Agency. 
This is a bill for a Police State.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.900
That thing has got 2 chances:
 fuck all and none.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.900
All those warships we sent to
play chicken in the South China Sea.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.800
One of them has crashed 
into a Chinese patrol boat.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
Jesus!

01:41.900 --> 01:45.600
Any loss of life will make it 
impossible for the Chinese to back down.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.100
You fuckwit smart, get this:
 we won it, after all.

Hello? What is it?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.900
Yeah, I'm picking him up on the way in.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.100
The airport is only 10 minutes away.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.300
You don't worry, I'll be there.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.900
Thanks.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.200

03:05.200 --> 03:07.400
I'm picking up my 
wayward son from the airport.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.200
- He's been suspended from school, for setting fire... 
- Mal...

- Yes.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.900
I've been asked to stop.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.700
I'm in the shit if 
I don't make this plane, David.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
What will you do? 
Just pick up for me?

03:44.200 --> 03:45.600
- Certainly, Sir.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.600
Thanks, mate.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.300
We're under attack!

04:39.500 --> 04:42.100
At 07:00, air traffic controller
 at Canberra Airport

04:42.100 --> 04:44.400
lost radio contact 
with Oz flight 804.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.800
We were summoned here. National operations 
sent orders to put on stand-by.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.400
804 came within a base 
deck of an outgoing jet.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.700
But the situation righted itself.

04:51.700 --> 04:52.900
And we heard it was a glitch.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.100
And then 5 minutes ago, the entire 
communication system in Canberra went down.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.700
- Have we got a link 
to the PM in Tokyo?

04:57.700 --> 04:58.800
- We're working on it.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.600
Yes, I understand that, 
but it's a matter of urgency.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.400
Well, can't you try a different system?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.000
Yes, but we need to get through to him.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.100
I need to see the radar.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.500
It's a closed system.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.600
Now!

05:09.600 --> 05:12.100
AsTxc, advanced stage 
traffic system, now.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.300
How long before you're in?

05:13.300 --> 05:15.200
- Ah, you're here. 
We can't get through to the PM.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.000
National operations have 
taken control of the situation?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.500
There were 5 planes
 heading into land,

05:19.500 --> 05:22.000
and another 8 in 
Canberra ATC airspace.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.200
And there's no way 
of talking to them.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.200
- We're assuming the system has been hacked. 
- Yeah.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.000
Is this China?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.700
In a viable possibility. 
And we can't discount

05:29.700 --> 05:33.300
- Al-Qaeda, North Korea... 
- Speculation is no help right now.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.300
It could be homegrown. Though they haven't 
tripped any alerts, we've had no warning.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.600
For Christ's sake, people, 
we know who it is!

05:38.600 --> 05:40.400
We killed one of their sailors.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.400
- The visuals are coming through now.

05:45.100 --> 05:47.300
Is this one of the affected flights?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Yeah.

05:50.100 --> 05:54.300
We need to take precautions in case
 this a precursor for a physical attack.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.900
We should raise the alert to Echo.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.600
- But what if it's just another glitch?

05:57.600 --> 06:00.500
Activating Echo is gonna cost 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.700
- It's troops redeployed, jets mobilized...
 - Cairns is gone.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.400
Alright, contingencies are in place.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.300
Aircraft on approach will continue 
to land according to their flight plan.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.600
Those in the air will 
go into a prearranged

06:13.600 --> 06:15.700
holding pattern, 
designed to keep them apart.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.700
If everyone sticks to plan, 
there is absolutely no risk.

06:18.700 --> 06:20.200
And what if they 
don't stick to the plan?

06:20.200 --> 06:21.900
- Why haven't we got 
through to the PM yet?

06:21.900 --> 06:24.800
- A satellite trouble taking wind.
 - Well, can you keep trying?

06:24.800 --> 06:25.800
- Can we access defense coms?

06:25.800 --> 06:28.500
We're checking now if 
Townsville can take over Cairns.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.600
Williamtown ranges too.

06:29.600 --> 06:30.900
What about Richmond air base?

06:30.900 --> 06:34.000
- All of the air traffic controllers 
were redeployed from there 3 days ago.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.700
What?! Who ordered that?

06:35.700 --> 06:37.700
We got into Canberra 
air traffic controllers,

06:37.700 --> 06:39.700
definite unusual activity there.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.900
Unusual activity?

06:40.900 --> 06:42.700
They hacked in through 
the flight planning system

06:42.700 --> 06:44.100
and got control of communications.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.100
- Can we stop it? Can we shut it down? 
- Oh, that's the plan.

06:46.300 --> 06:48.100
- Yes, okay, I'm in, thanks.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.000
What's he doing here?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I asked for him.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.300
- Morning. 
- Ambassador.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.300
Whatever you need, let me know.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.100
I'm linked to General Wallace, in Washington.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.500
What about navy radio coms?

06:59.500 --> 07:02.100
They are all deployed. 
And they don't have the range.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.400
They've taken out Sydney.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.700
- What?!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.300
Alright. Let's raise Echo alert.

07:16.300 --> 07:20.800
- Safe base Echo... 
- Safe base Echo immediate update...

07:20.800 --> 07:24.000
- Yes. Immediate updates.

[Door opens]

07:40.800 --> 07:42.200
- Are you okay?

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Apparently, I've broken several laws, 
most of which carry potential jail sentence.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.900
Okay, I'm... 
I'm gonna talk to Gus.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.000
I'm gonna get the paper's lawyers onto that.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
And... and anything else that you need.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.600
Felix, I'm so sorry.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.400
If... If I've known that it was stolen

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
 - Intelligence, I never would have... 
- I knew what I was getting into.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.100
- Well, I... 
- I'm just sorry I couldn't crack it.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.100
I really wanted to.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.500
I think I just wanted to impress you.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.300
Did I impress you?

08:13.600 --> 08:15.700
Yeah, very much.

08:24.500 --> 08:26.000
Goodbye, Harriet.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.000
Bye.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.100
- Nine minutes.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.000
- No sign of a physical attack?
 - No.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.799
Cairns is on the limit of 
military air traffic control.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.400
3 flights are safely down in Canberra,

08:46.400 --> 08:49.500
6 in Sydney and 37 are holding.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.800
How long can they do that, 
with limited fuel supplies?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.400
Well, we've got at least 20 minutes.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.500
We've got a trace, it's going through Tor.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.800
In English, please...

08:57.800 --> 08:59.500
Onion routing Tor encrypts data.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.200
You can see it going in, and it comes out
 somewhere else, you can't track it.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.600
So, whoever it is, is still
 out there controlling us?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.200
What else are they planning?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
What's happening? What is that?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.300
Air New Zealand 101 into Sydney

09:11.300 --> 09:14.300
set off an emergency code, 
seventy-seven hundred.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.000
They're diverting from the holding path.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.600
- Why? 
- Well, we don't know without coms.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.500
Mechanical emergency, fire on board...

09:20.500 --> 09:21.600
They're coming into land.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.100
You said there'd be no risk 
if they followed protocol.

09:24.100 --> 09:27.000
Correct. Most of the airliners
 are fitted with TCAS,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.500
and automatic system that communicates
 jet to jet, to avoid collision.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.400

contact with the pilots.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.900

09:41.900 --> 09:43.400
- Sydney is under a heavy cloud.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.800
We have to shut those 
bastards down, now!

09:45.800 --> 09:48.400
- We're counterattacking but they are evading us.
 We're doing everything we can.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.400
Well, do more!

09:59.200 --> 10:01.000
We've lost the trace.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.600
No mobile contact with those pilots?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.500
- Alright, Ministers, I just got word.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.300
Our Coast Guard's Icebreaker 
Polar Star is in Sydney Harbour.

it's enough range, but...

flying around in circles, with nothing
 inside me, but a packet of nuts

12:31.400 --> 12:34.200
and 3 cups of a noxious beverage.

12:34.300 --> 12:39.200
So, whichever one of you, bastards,
 is planning on giving me the shits today,

I advise that you hold off until after lunch.

[Closes Door]

13:00.500 --> 13:02.100

that ASD was so keen to 
get their hands on that SIM,

13:04.500 --> 13:07.100
is reason enough for us
 to not drop this story.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.900
There is a Governement Agency involved,

there is a Minister involved,

What?

You specifically defied me.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.800
Ignored my advice and went 
ahead with the decryption anyway.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.600
And now you and your little fuck-buddy

13:26.600 --> 13:29.500
have pissed off every

13:30.900 --> 13:33.700
I told Felix that he could use our lawyers.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.800
Huh. Yeah, of course he can!

13:35.800 --> 13:38.800
And why? Because we are responsible!

13:38.800 --> 13:41.400
Correction. YOU're responsible.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.800
But because I made the 
ill-considered decision, 15 years ago,

of recommending you for a job,

No.

 that I didn't already know...

about it? What else are you planning?

But I don't expect to be used, either.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.200
I've gotta take this.

43:02.500 --> 43:04.300
I'll see you later. Yeah?

43:07.400 --> 43:08.600
- Hello?

43:08.600 --> 43:12.400
- Yeah, look, I can do the 3h30, but...

43:12.400 --> 43:14.800
- Tell him I'll call on approach and...

43:16.900 --> 43:18.000
- I didn't get them.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.700
[Door closes] 
Can you send it through again?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.900
- Hey, Mom, it's me.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.900
I'm coming home early.

43:29.900 --> 43:31.000
Today.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.000
- Hi, Cassie, it's Harriet.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Ah, Qui hasn't shown up.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.300
Can you give me a call 
when you get this? I'm worried.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.800
[Incoming text]

45:07.200 --> 45:11.300
Never again do we want to see an attack like
 the one that we saw in this country yesterday.

45:12.600 --> 45:16.800
The security breach has
 highlighted the need for one body

45:16.800 --> 45:20.500
to coordinate military and
 domestic Intelligence services.

45:20.500 --> 45:26.200
Today, I'm announcing the creation
 of the Safer Australia Agency,

45:26.200 --> 45:28.200
to be headed by the Attorney-General.

45:30.100 --> 45:35.100
Safer Australia will gather 
information from all of the other Agencies,

45:35.100 --> 45:42.300
including ASD, ASIS, ASIO and
 the Australian Federal Police.

45:42.300 --> 45:47.000
Connected to our closest allies, 
through the Five Eyes international arrangement,

45:47.000 --> 45:53.700
Safer Australia will ensure that no threat
 to our nation's security will go undetected.

45:57.600 --> 46:04.200
Safer Australia Agency will 
retain keys for all encrypted communications

46:04.200 --> 46:07.300
within Australia and
 in-and-out of the country.

46:07.300 --> 46:12.500
No one who is planning to
 do harm, will be able to hide.

46:12.500 --> 46:17.100
It will be an offense
 to report or publish

46:17.100 --> 46:20.500
any information 
identified by the Agency

46:20.500 --> 46:23.900
as detrimental 
to National Security.

46:23.900 --> 46:26.500
[Journalist's questions] 

46:26.500 --> 46:28.500
One moment, please...

46:28.700 --> 46:30.500
Futhermore,

46:31.200 --> 46:34.000
the Agency has the power

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
to detain and question

46:36.000 --> 46:40.300
anyone suspected 
of having such information.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.300
- Is she fuckin' serious?

46:42.300 --> 46:44.300
 [Journalist's questions]
 - Thank you.

46:44.300 --> 46:47.400
[Journalist's talking]
 Thank you all.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.300
- Yes, thank you very much for coming.
- Huh, thanks for having us...

47:17.000 --> 47:19.600
We've been played, Gus.

47:19.600 --> 47:23.300
Yeah. Yeah, we have.

47:56.800 --> 47:59.900
[Shots fired]

48:12.000 --> 48:13.300
Shit.

48:27.300 --> 48:33.700
[Panting]
