You know, studies show

00:20.710 --> 00:22.290

When Professor G asked me

00:56.420 --> 00:59.210
I thought this is gonna be
super great, and it is!

00:59.210 --> 01:01.330

going through something?

01:12.290 --> 01:14.170
Heh! That's news to me.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.250

Here's what we're going to do.

-You.

learn something from her
socialization experience.

Did they have a floating

07:02.290 --> 07:04.750

They had a trained bear

07:06.670 --> 07:08.250

10:09.080 --> 10:10.750
-Well--
-Oh! A memory wipe!

10:10.750 --> 10:13.330
-Actually--
-And this, and this,
and this!

10:13.330 --> 10:15.380
Ooh, and this!

10:15.380 --> 10:18.000
A little of this.
A little of that there.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.460
Ooh! One amnesia-ccino
coming up!

10:20.460 --> 10:22.790
She didn't know he was me!

10:22.790 --> 10:25.290
Wait, wait.
How could she not know
you were you?

10:25.290 --> 10:26.670
You are so obviously you.

10:26.670 --> 10:29.830
It gets worse.
She's in love with him--
uh, me!

10:29.830 --> 10:31.380
I don't know, it's complicated.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.830
Fred:
Ah, the power
of the secret identity.

10:33.830 --> 10:37.420
Intrepid investigator
Rita Rampart never realized
cab driver Lash Looper

10:37.420 --> 10:39.250
was secretly Captain Fancy.
(grunts)

10:39.250 --> 10:41.170
This is a comic book thing
again, right?

10:41.170 --> 10:43.670
Indeed!
Quickly, to the Fred Room!

10:43.670 --> 10:45.380
♪ ♪

10:47.080 --> 10:49.380
We'll start you
with the basics: BattleMax
and Avenger Duck,

10:49.380 --> 10:50.880
maybe throw in
a little Maya Mayan.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.000
Skip the training wheels.
I'm going straight
to Captain Fancy , 188.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.500
Whoa! No!

10:55.500 --> 10:58.710
Fred, it's the only way
we'll figure out how
to beat High Voltage.

10:58.710 --> 11:00.670
I won't crease
its stupid pages
or anything.

11:00.670 --> 11:02.380
Stupid?
You need to dial it down

11:02.380 --> 11:04.210
before you crease
our friendship.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.380
We don't rummage through
classic comics like
we're barbarians.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.620
These are works of art.
They must be treated as such.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.960
And gum?
Thank you.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.170
And the backup.
Come on.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.290
Hands up!

11:18.290 --> 11:21.670
Also, I should probably tell you
I don't have Captain Fancy,
issue 188. Okay!

11:21.670 --> 11:23.710
-What?
-I only know what's
within its pages

11:23.710 --> 11:26.500
-based on whispered rumor.
-Do not start
at the beginning.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.420
I'll start at the beginning!
June 1963.

11:29.420 --> 11:33.500
Disgruntled artist AJ Dohertz
slips a wildly inappropriate
drawing of Captain Fancy

11:33.500 --> 11:36.790
into issue 188.
It wasn't until
after it was printed

11:36.790 --> 11:39.290
-that people caught
the offending-- hmm-- image.
-(gasping)

11:39.290 --> 11:42.460
The entire run is pulped,
save for one copy,
smuggled to freedom,

11:42.460 --> 11:44.170
few have ever seen it.

11:44.170 --> 11:48.420
To my eternal frustration,
I am not one of the lucky few.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.080
So, where is it now?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.670
In the clutches
of my arch-nemesis.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.290
Be forewarned, he's
a dark and dangerous foe.

11:55.290 --> 11:58.290

12:08.880 --> 12:10.290
We need to talk

You're talkin'
to the owner,
dream girl.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.460
Chilling, isn't he?

12:15.750 --> 12:20.000
Richardson Mole, San Fransokyo's
most eligible 11-year-old.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.380
And you are?

12:21.380 --> 12:23.080
Much older than you.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.380
-Nice.
-Fred, talk to him.

12:25.380 --> 12:27.250
Hey!
This is a business call,
Richardson.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.670
Let's keep this professional.

12:28.670 --> 12:31.750
-Very well.
-We need to see
Captain Fancy, 188.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.750
Ah, the very issue
I sniped from you
at that online auction.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.290
You cut the power
to my house!

12:36.290 --> 12:39.210
Almost... almost... al--

12:39.210 --> 12:40.330
(power clicking off)

12:40.330 --> 12:41.960
Mole!

12:41.960 --> 12:44.330
-Those charges
were never proven.
-(yells)

12:44.330 --> 12:46.170
Can we just see
the dumb comic book?

12:46.170 --> 12:48.330
Ooh, I like you
angry, dream girl.

12:48.330 --> 12:51.250
Follow me to...
the Mole Hole!

12:53.500 --> 12:54.710
I'm waiting!

12:55.880 --> 12:57.960

-Beat my high score
of any of these,

13:15.830 --> 13:19.420
and I will let you see

13:19.420 --> 13:23.830

-Whack-A-Fred?
Let's do this.

13:23.830 --> 13:27.420
Ooh, poor choice.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.290

It's beautiful.

13:59.710 --> 14:01.080
Oh, just give it.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.460

14:03.460 --> 14:04.710

14:07.960 --> 14:10.170
N5-4, you've put on some weight.

14:10.170 --> 14:11.960
There's some junk
in your nucleus.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.540
Pathogenic amoeba
appears thermostable.

14:14.540 --> 14:17.710
Hey, Karmi-- Uh!
I mean, hi! Hello!

14:17.710 --> 14:20.120
How is it, uh, goin'?

14:20.120 --> 14:22.920
Um, should I be wearing
a biohazard suit?

14:22.920 --> 14:25.290
Are your eyes bleeding?

14:25.290 --> 14:27.080
They are currently not.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.540
Then you're fine.
Probably.

14:29.540 --> 14:32.210
So, you like
dangerous organisms?

14:32.210 --> 14:34.210
Duh.
By studying them,
we can figure out

14:34.210 --> 14:36.330
therapeutic uses for them.
It's called "science."

14:36.330 --> 14:37.960
That's actually interesting.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.500
Maybe when you're done,
we could talk about my journal?

14:40.500 --> 14:43.290
Uh, you know,
just-- just the one
that's due Friday.

14:43.290 --> 14:45.960
Nobody cares.
Hand me N5-4.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.080
Oh, uh, sure.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.290

No! You killed N5-4!

14:54.290 --> 14:56.120
This is a fortunate result.

14:56.120 --> 15:00.290
N5-4 would have soon reached
a contagion factor of 10.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.790
N5-4 was the first
pathogen I ever grew.

15:03.790 --> 15:06.330
I will download instructions
for proper disinfection methods

15:06.330 --> 15:09.920
to ensure no part
of N5-4 survives.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.250
He was more than
a flesh-eating virus.
He was a friend.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.380
If you have any more N5-4
in storage, we should
also dispose of--

15:17.380 --> 15:19.120
Shut him up!

15:19.120 --> 15:21.170
You are upset.
I have relaxation suggestions.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.920
-(phone buzzing)
-Some relaxation
techniques include...

15:23.920 --> 15:25.670
-Well, answer it!
-...drinking herbal tea...

Okay. Yeah.

15:30.670 --> 15:34.290
So, something came up,
and um, we-- I need to, um...

15:37.420 --> 15:40.960

whistling, racquetball...

15:44.080 --> 15:46.080
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.580
Mm-hmm.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.380
Mm-hmm.

16:12.210 --> 16:14.380
Yes! I get it!
I totally get it!

16:14.380 --> 16:16.330
So you actually
found an answer
in that thing?

16:16.330 --> 16:19.790
-Couldn't be more clear.
-Great! Time to roll!

-Who?

19:57.460 --> 19:59.210
Uh, not important.

19:59.210 --> 20:01.250
When people look at me,
what do they see?

20:01.250 --> 20:05.380
A robotics major,
a teen genius, or maybe
just a guy tryin' to fit in.

20:05.380 --> 20:08.210
Because that's what Karmi saw,
and I thank her for that.

20:08.210 --> 20:09.380
And the journal.

20:09.380 --> 20:12.540
-Granville: Karmi?
-I don't know
what to say.

20:12.540 --> 20:14.210
'Cause you're modest
that way.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.540
Professor, Karmi was
great this week.

20:16.540 --> 20:17.830
I learned a lot.

20:17.830 --> 20:19.210
I'm happy to hear it.

20:19.210 --> 20:20.210
Dismissed.

20:24.710 --> 20:28.210
So, all this wasn't actually
about me, was it?

20:28.210 --> 20:30.250
We are through here,
Mr. Hamada.

20:30.250 --> 20:33.250
It was actually about
Karmi. Am I right?

20:33.250 --> 20:35.670
I said, we are through.

20:42.290 --> 20:45.080
You could've sold me out
in there, but you didn't.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.620
You got it bad for me,
don't you?

20:47.620 --> 20:50.460
I do not have it--
(grunts)

20:50.460 --> 20:53.250
It's just that
Granville's right.
We have a lot in common.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.210
The age thing,
the genius thing.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.830
The rush of hormones
coursing through

20:56.830 --> 20:58.120
your pubescent bodies.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.330
Pimples will start
to appear on your
face and back--

21:00.330 --> 21:02.080
Thanks for making it
awkward, Baymax.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.420
-Baymax: You are welcome.
-I'm just saying,
maybe we could be friends.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.620
-(phone beeps)
-Big Hero 6 news alert!

21:07.620 --> 21:11.380
High Voltage's rhythmic
reign of terror became
a reign of error

21:11.380 --> 21:15.670
-when the mother/daughter duo
ran into Big Hero--
-(phone beeps)

21:15.670 --> 21:18.250
(sighs)
I wish he were here.

21:18.250 --> 21:19.330
Seriously?

21:19.330 --> 21:22.420
Big Hero Six "shocked"
High Voltage by insulating them

21:22.420 --> 21:24.750
in a maximum security prison.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.750
-Yet another of--
-(mutes TV audio)

21:37.210 --> 21:39.210
(theme music playing)
