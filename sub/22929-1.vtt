- It won't take you a minute.
- It's not a time issue, Nev.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.666
WOMAN: Hey Bex!
- Morning, Barbara, love.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.625
Just put on a bit o' lipstick,
put your hair in pigtails

02:26.666 --> 02:27.750
and let me take you full tour.

02:27.791 --> 02:28.958
I understand the request.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.416
It won't be asking the world

02:30.458 --> 02:31.666
to show me a bit o'
stocking and top as well.

02:31.708 --> 02:33.791
I tell you, it'll be
the end of your world

02:33.833 --> 02:35.208
if you don't fucking shut up!

02:35.250 --> 02:37.416
Well, that's not very nice.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.750
Look, I'm not asking you
to nosh me up.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.250
Oh, you've just as much
chance.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.916
Really?

02:42.958 --> 02:44.416
Ugh!

02:44.458 --> 02:48.291
[snicker] Hey, Bex, did you
hear about Pete Hardware?

02:48.333 --> 02:50.708
- Was he hammered again?
- No, not like you think.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.166
He got jumped on
the other night.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.666
Who by?

02:53.708 --> 02:57.708
I don't know, but, uh,
somebody who really meant it.

02:57.750 --> 03:01.250
Knocked seven bells out of him,
he's in intensive care,

03:01.291 --> 03:04.583
and Ron Tupperware reckons
he could be blind for life.

03:04.625 --> 03:06.041
What? And you only think
to tell me this now?

03:06.083 --> 03:07.333
I'm tellin' you now.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.458
But you've just been
asking me for a blow job!

03:09.500 --> 03:11.708
No, I asked you
for some pictures for a wank.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.458
The blow job was your idea.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.708
- Oh, you're a lovely man.
- Oh, I am a lovely man.

03:15.750 --> 03:19.333
I'm very sensitive, I am,
and I'll tell you this...

03:19.375 --> 03:21.833
I did a speech
at Big C's funeral.

03:21.875 --> 03:23.916
- Who?
- Big Clive, you know,

03:23.958 --> 03:26.041
big barrel of shite.
Oh, creepy bastard.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.958
Yeah. You know what I said
when I heard he were dead.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.875
He was gonna fuck
all the kids?

03:29.916 --> 03:32.416
Cor! Have you heard
what's comin' out of her mouth?

03:32.458 --> 03:33.750
I'm more concerned
with puttin' somethin'

03:33.791 --> 03:35.625
into it actually.
[sighs] Ugh, Jesus!

03:35.666 --> 03:37.208
That'll be a night
your mum's out, is it?

03:37.250 --> 03:38.875
We could have the house
to ourselves.

03:38.916 --> 03:40.416
You know, just... just go.

03:40.458 --> 03:42.958
Make it 50 times wittier
and come back to me, will you?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.208
Love to your mum, which I'm sure
you give her nightly

03:45.250 --> 03:47.083
after druggin' her.
Go on!

03:47.125 --> 03:49.875
Away to fuck!
Oh!

03:49.916 --> 03:51.166
Ethan didn't want those.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.791
Grandma-ma dropped them off
this morning.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.000
Well, you can tell him
from me, his grandma rocks!

03:55.041 --> 03:58.250
Yeah, I will. [sighs]
it'll make all the difference.

03:58.291 --> 04:01.750
Oh, oh... I nipped back home.

04:01.791 --> 04:05.208
What? You skiving git!
I barely coped!

04:06.458 --> 04:09.041
Oh.
Yeah.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.208
Is it?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.166
[sighs]

04:13.208 --> 04:14.708
[chuckles]

04:25.500 --> 04:28.416
[♪♪♪]

04:30.625 --> 04:33.791
Sorry... Sorry.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.833
[gasps and groans]

04:36.875 --> 04:39.166
[screaming]

04:50.250 --> 04:52.333
Tomorrow!

05:02.583 --> 05:05.041
Oh, you didn't need
to go through all this trouble.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.833
Two teas
and a packet of biscuits.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.291
I'll have bigger trouble today.

05:10.333 --> 05:13.500
[chuckles] Yeah, I'll bet
they keep you busy.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.875
They'd keep a team
of zookeepers busy.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.750
[chuckles]

05:18.791 --> 05:21.250
- Not that I'd change it.
- No.

05:21.291 --> 05:26.791
Well, apart from... [sighs]

05:35.291 --> 05:36.833
Am I gonna regret this?

05:36.875 --> 05:38.000
Hope not.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.916
I value me job. [chuckles]

05:39.958 --> 05:43.875
It's just...
well, you hear things.

05:43.916 --> 05:46.041
Yeah, so do I.

05:46.083 --> 05:49.250
About the companies
you're thinking of.

05:49.291 --> 05:52.541
And you're not one... of them.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.375
We've got a complaints book,
this thick.

05:55.416 --> 05:57.750
Do you know
what it says in there?

05:57.791 --> 06:02.083
- Go on.
- Nothing. Nothing.

06:02.125 --> 06:05.541
The rule is, one complaint,
and you're out.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.458
Can't afford to get
a reputation, not in this game.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.375
There's too many tyrants about,
too many bastards,

06:10.416 --> 06:14.208
pardon my language,
but that's what they are.

06:18.916 --> 06:22.750
[sighs]

06:22.791 --> 06:25.541
I've not told a soul.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.500
I was the same.

06:27.541 --> 06:28.583
The same?

06:28.625 --> 06:31.041
Same as you... when I did it.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.791
I'd lost my job.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.416
I was an estate agent.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.000
A lot of people
made a lot of money

06:36.041 --> 06:38.333
that they shouldn't have.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.833
I worked for somebody else.

06:40.875 --> 06:44.666
I did all right
until I didn't.

06:44.708 --> 06:48.083
Tried to hide it, and then they
came to repossess the house,

06:48.125 --> 06:51.916
and that was the first
my wife had heard of it.

06:51.958 --> 06:53.833
I'm lucky she loves me...

06:53.875 --> 06:56.625
and she sees
that I'm happy now.

06:56.666 --> 07:00.666
Doing a job that matters
actually makes a difference.

07:00.708 --> 07:05.166
[sighs] Look, see these?

07:05.208 --> 07:06.958
I'm going to leave them.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.125
Hang onto them for a bit

07:08.166 --> 07:10.250
just in case
you get the collywobbles

07:10.291 --> 07:14.041
or your lottery numbers come up.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.958
But if you're sure
it's for you,

07:17.000 --> 07:18.125
well, you've got my number.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.833
You just give me a call.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.750
[footsteps]

07:26.041 --> 07:27.916
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Lawler.

07:27.958 --> 07:29.666
It's Caroline.

07:29.708 --> 07:32.666
Sit down
and pass me a pen.

07:41.750 --> 07:44.625
[glass breaking]

08:04.833 --> 08:07.041
Tomorrow, right?

08:07.083 --> 08:09.083
[yelling] Right?

08:13.750 --> 08:15.083
[sirens]

08:15.125 --> 08:17.041
Have you read it?
Don't give much away, does it?

08:17.083 --> 08:19.000
Gives away the fact
the meeting is tomorrow.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.166
Yeah.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.333
Sorry about the state of it.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.250
East End's had it.
Yeah, they won't be happy.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.958
Who?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.208
Well, it's not like
we're gonna tell them, is it?

08:28.250 --> 08:29.291
It would be a bit weird.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.333
"Hello.
Me son read your letter.

08:31.375 --> 08:35.625
He's autistic, and he likes to
draw circles on everything."

08:35.666 --> 08:37.041
And we're ready?

08:37.082 --> 08:38.332
Of course we are!

08:38.375 --> 08:40.207
I'll do me sad face
and you can wear that,

08:40.250 --> 08:41.875
that dress with your tits
hanging out.

08:41.916 --> 08:43.291
How much more ready
do we need to be?

08:43.332 --> 08:45.291
Well, I'd like to know
what we're gonna say.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.583
You seem nice.
Give us money.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.500
You're not really
all that bothered, are you?

08:52.541 --> 08:53.791
No, no, Dawn.

08:53.833 --> 08:56.125
I want to spend the rest
of my life on this market

08:56.166 --> 08:57.666
freezing me ass off,

08:57.708 --> 08:59.916
fending off borderline sex cases
who drop stock on the floor

08:59.958 --> 09:01.208
in the hopes
that I will bend down

09:01.250 --> 09:02.125
and they can rest
their greasy fucking ball bags

09:02.166 --> 09:03.541
on my head.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.291
Who does that?

09:05.333 --> 09:07.041
Whore!

09:07.083 --> 09:11.083
[giggles]

09:11.125 --> 09:13.333
Jesus! You know,
I gave up a job for this.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.666
No, no, no, no.

09:15.708 --> 09:19.000
You gave up a job
and then you did this.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.750
Some of us
have already spent our lives

09:20.791 --> 09:22.208
freezing our asses off
in this market

09:22.250 --> 09:23.833
while others,
good luck to you,

09:23.875 --> 09:25.166
have enough to make a fortune.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.208
- I sold cars.
- Posh cars.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.916
And I hated it.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.791
- No, no, but...
- No, no, but what?

09:31.833 --> 09:33.208
If you feel
that I've dragged you back

09:33.250 --> 09:34.958
to do something that you don't
really want to do

09:35.000 --> 09:36.750
because of a sense of guilt
for leaving me in the shit

09:36.791 --> 09:37.666
the first time around?
I don't!

09:37.708 --> 09:39.750
Then, then, I get it.

09:39.791 --> 09:42.833
But I want this, and I need it,
and we've got a chance.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.333
So if you want out
and you've got cold feet again,

09:45.375 --> 09:46.416
and I understand.
I really do,

09:46.458 --> 09:47.958
but I'm seeing him tomorrow.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.166
Ever since that dickhead
left me... stop laughing.

09:51.208 --> 09:55.958
[laugh] I'm laughing because
you're ace when you're mad.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.458
- I'm upset.
- Well, don't be.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.250
We will go and see them,
you and me.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.958
So stop giving me
all this me shit!

10:04.416 --> 10:06.583
And don't we have the plan?

10:09.041 --> 10:11.041
Well, you've certainly got
a comprehensive

10:11.083 --> 10:13.166
set of figures here.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.125
Yeah. We've worked
really hard on it.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.708
But of course,
these are projections.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.625
The real work is
turning it into reality.

10:19.666 --> 10:22.958
Oh, we're perfectly
placed, are we?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.583
Pardon?

10:24.625 --> 10:26.333
We work on the market.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.416
Hmmm.

10:31.708 --> 10:35.291
Have you done the market
research for your... uh...

10:35.333 --> 10:38.791
organic tea, coffee,
and specialist cake shop?

10:38.833 --> 10:40.833
Yeah.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.375
And what did you find?

10:42.416 --> 10:45.083
Everyone we've spoken to
has been dead positive.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.083
Well, how many people
was that?

10:47.125 --> 10:48.958
Everyone we meet. I mean,
there's a cup of tea

10:49.000 --> 10:50.583
and an ear-bending
when you come through us.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.958
[giggles]

11:01.041 --> 11:04.291
Yeah, and um, a lot of people
already go to these places.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.333
Oh, competition?

11:05.375 --> 11:06.916
Oh, no.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.250
Not near us.
There's no one.

11:08.291 --> 11:11.750
No, no. Not since
the last one shut down.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.750
[child giggling]

11:22.791 --> 11:24.208
Oh-h-h, what're you
having for your tea?

11:24.250 --> 11:27.375
- Cocos.
- Oh-h-h, good idea.

11:27.416 --> 11:29.250
Bad idea?
What do you think?

11:29.291 --> 11:30.875
I think I should
have a shower and eat.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.125
- No!
- Oh, but Daddy's hungry.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.250
Bollocks hungry!

11:35.291 --> 11:36.375
Our daughter says that now.

11:36.416 --> 11:37.625
Since when?

11:37.666 --> 11:39.625
Since Gracie taught it to her
apparently.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.333
Gracie, who says
she's rubbish at PE

11:42.375 --> 11:44.083
and her ballet skirt smells?

11:44.125 --> 11:46.375
The latest one is
she has small teeth.

11:46.416 --> 11:48.291
She's six.
What's she meant to have?

11:48.333 --> 11:52.041
Then she slapped her,
didn't she?

11:52.083 --> 11:54.041
Right.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.500
And what's the school doing
while this is going on?

11:56.541 --> 11:58.875
Oh, it's just kids, isn't it?

12:08.541 --> 12:10.833
Evenin'.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.958
I was going to
drop this off tomorrow.

12:17.291 --> 12:18.750
I trust you.

12:18.791 --> 12:20.541
See you soon.

12:20.583 --> 12:23.458
[birds chirping]

12:25.958 --> 12:27.583
- We'll do it.
- We won't.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.416
It's just gonna take
a bit more time, that's all.

Oh, you'll fucking get it
all right.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.916

my best stuff, didn't I?

15:03.958 --> 15:06.083

what we need the money for.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.708
I brought me best stuff.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.583

15:10.625 --> 15:13.500
Bex, Bex, you do
the talking this time.

15:13.541 --> 15:15.333
I'll just nod and agree.
[breathless] Okay.

For any right-angle triangle,
the square of the hypotenuse

of the other two sides.

- All the time. Pick-up line.

15:36.791 --> 15:38.875
Yeah. Well, it's better than
"Nice tits. Let's do it."

- Go on, make yourself handy.

15:40.666 --> 15:41.958
Hold that.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.291
Keep the hairy hand gang
from getting a look at me.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.166
Do you want me
to go and have a word?

15:47.208 --> 15:49.333

Oh, you being a hard man?

15:49.375 --> 15:51.416

that dangerous.

15:51.458 --> 15:53.625
Well, you won't say
that when they've tazered you.

15:53.666 --> 15:55.250
Well, yeah.

That's how he kills
his chickens.

16:00.458 --> 16:03.416
So, worked here long?

16:03.458 --> 16:05.083
God, you do need new lines.

16:05.125 --> 16:08.458

trying to be friendly.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.666
Are you new?

16:09.708 --> 16:11.875
Not... no.

16:11.916 --> 16:13.458
I did go away
for a few years, mind you.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.125
Yeah? Doing what?

16:15.166 --> 16:20.333
[sighs] Selling, um,
selling condoms.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.333
Outside your mother's house.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.041
What's it got to do with you?

16:25.541 --> 16:28.125
Aren't you a bit overdressed
for the part?

16:28.166 --> 16:30.333
What? I work in a market.
I can't look nice?

16:30.375 --> 16:33.000
You'd look gorgeous
wherever you worked.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.083
Going to the bank actually.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.875
Oh, yeah?

16:36.916 --> 16:39.083
You got your gun
and your balaclava?

16:39.125 --> 16:42.125
Something much more scary,
my wit and personality.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.750
No. We're looking
for a loan actually,

16:43.791 --> 16:45.416
and not a prison sentence.

16:45.458 --> 16:48.416
Oh, you star!

16:48.458 --> 16:49.541
Hello.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.666
I'm just going.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.500
Left, right, left, right.

16:52.541 --> 16:53.791
Pardon?

16:53.833 --> 16:55.375
It's how walking works.

16:55.416 --> 16:57.083
Give it a go.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.250
Nice meeting you.

17:00.291 --> 17:01.750
And good luck with the uh...

17:01.791 --> 17:04.500
Cheers!

17:04.540 --> 17:07.083

- Good luck. You'll get it.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.708
Gracie, now!

17:16.750 --> 17:19.208
[sighs] I have spin class
in exactly 20 minutes,

17:19.250 --> 17:20.208
and if you make me late again

17:20.250 --> 17:21.458
because you're
funnying around...

17:21.500 --> 17:22.958
- Excuse me.
- In fact,

17:23.000 --> 17:24.415
I'm not
going to be late.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.790
You can sit in the car
while I'm in the gym,

17:25.833 --> 17:28.583
and you can be late for school.

17:30.291 --> 17:32.166
Um, I was hoping
I could have a word.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.250
I'm late.

17:33.291 --> 17:34.750
I'm Chloe's dad from school.

17:34.791 --> 17:37.375
Does that somehow
make me not late?

17:42.125 --> 17:43.416
Are you the new driver?
[phone rings]

17:43.458 --> 17:45.333
No. No. Our daughters
are at school together.

17:45.375 --> 17:48.708
[sighs]
I'm standing on my driveway,

17:48.750 --> 17:50.666
and guess what
I'm not looking at.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.666
Well, nearly's no good to me.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.083
[sighs]

17:54.125 --> 17:56.916
Well, I can't do any more
than I already have.

17:56.958 --> 17:59.083
Speed bumps outside the school.

17:59.125 --> 18:02.166
I fast-tracked it, but I can't
just give it the okay.

18:02.208 --> 18:05.375
Well, I could, but uh,
how does that look?

18:05.416 --> 18:08.625
Besides, some of the little
bastards need running over.

18:08.666 --> 18:10.125
[phone rings]

18:10.166 --> 18:11.500
Hello.
Uh, yeah.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.000
I don't know about all of that.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.583
I... I just wanted to
have a word with you

18:14.625 --> 18:16.291
about your daughter Gracie.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.916
Um, I mean, it's nothing really.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.666
It's just a bit of name calling,
and I'm sure they're all at it,

18:19.708 --> 18:22.208
but Gracie's name
seems to come up a lot.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.708
And now, there's been a slap.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.083
Which hospital
is your daughter in?

18:26.125 --> 18:27.458
- Oh, she's not.
- Well, what did the paramedics

18:27.500 --> 18:28.541
say when you called them?

18:28.583 --> 18:30.000
It's just a kid's slap,
I suppose.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.083
Exactly.

18:32.125 --> 18:35.041
Now I suggest you go
and tell that to your daughter.

18:37.583 --> 18:42.000
Okay. Well, cheers
for all your help with that.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.291
Well, that's
the end of it then.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.208
[whistles]

18:57.250 --> 18:59.375
Do us a favor, Nev.
Consider pissing off.

18:59.416 --> 19:01.833
I'd have to think long
and hard about that.

19:05.416 --> 19:07.250
How much of your stuff
do you sell a day, Nev?

19:07.291 --> 19:08.208
I'll tell you how much.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.708
Close to fuck all.

19:09.750 --> 19:10.916
There you are
moaning every night

19:10.958 --> 19:12.708
about all the stock
you have to give away.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.458
You know what that is?
Look, look, watch watch watch!

19:14.500 --> 19:16.166
You're not even there,
and they're avoiding you.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.250
It just comes naturally to
people to give you a wide berth.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.500
Your store is like
a fucking exclusion zone,

19:20.541 --> 19:22.416
and that's why you sell nothing
and that's why you make nothing

19:22.458 --> 19:23.708
and that's why you look
like a fucking tramp

19:23.750 --> 19:25.958
and that's why
no woman living, dead,

19:26.000 --> 19:27.916
nor not even yet born,
would ever consider you

19:27.958 --> 19:33.625
anything more than a frothy,
rancid, wobbling piece of shite!

19:36.166 --> 19:38.916
You snotty bad mouth!

19:47.750 --> 19:50.625
- Feel better after that.
- Yeah. That was great.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.333
I tell you
the real genius of that...

19:52.375 --> 19:53.708
the fact that he's on
the allocation committee.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.000
So, when my contract's up
in a month,

19:55.041 --> 19:56.625
he'll be well placed
to tell us to piss off.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.791
He's not gonna do that
with all the empty stalls, Dawn.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.291
He'll stick us in death corner
then which is just as bad.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.208
So cheers, Bex, you just added
another five years

20:03.250 --> 20:04.791
to me working in this shithole!

20:04.833 --> 20:05.875
Well, I think we would have
been out sooner

20:05.916 --> 20:08.166
if you'd kept your mouth shut.
Me?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.458
"Oh, no, not since
the last one closed down."

20:10.500 --> 20:12.000
So now you're saying
it's my fault.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.333
Well, no. I think that's
exactly what he wanted to hear.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.708
Well, maybe it's as well
he did hear it.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.333

her five grand.

20:23.708 --> 20:25.125
Looks like you were
starting a fight,

20:25.166 --> 20:26.333
so I was gonna YouTube it.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.791
Oh, yeah?

20:52.375 --> 20:54.125
Do better.

20:54.166 --> 20:55.750
I can't.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.750
Well, more incentive
needed then.

No, no!

[yelling] No!
[dog whines]

21:07.125 --> 21:09.500
Well, [sighs] I'm not sure
it'll all look better

21:09.541 --> 21:11.291
with a few dirty butties
inside you,

21:11.333 --> 21:12.500
but at least
you'll be fat and greasy

21:12.541 --> 21:14.583
so you'll have other stuff
to worry about.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.208
There you go.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.333
So, what was the plan then?

21:22.375 --> 21:25.166
Get off this pitch.
Open up a proper café.

21:25.208 --> 21:27.083
That's exactly
what's needed around here.

21:27.125 --> 21:29.625
That's what we told
the bank... sort of.

21:29.666 --> 21:30.750
So, you'll give us the cash

21:30.791 --> 21:32.541
now that you know
what a great idea it is.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.333

21:34.375 --> 21:35.708

to a holiday though

Oh, mates again, are you?

21:41.458 --> 21:43.083
Good.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.750
I was paying her a compliment.
[sighs] It's wasted on me.

21:45.791 --> 21:47.208

21:47.250 --> 21:48.875

to recognize it.

That is an outrage
and a tragedy.

Tell me where your husband is.
I'll go and have a word.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.041
I don't know how
you're living as it is.

23:29.083 --> 23:32.125
Oh, we go making shoplifting.

23:32.166 --> 23:34.625
How else do you think
we spend our days, huh?

23:34.666 --> 23:36.875
We go and do the burglary,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.500
and we lift from the shops,
[speaking foreign language].

23:39.541 --> 23:41.250
We are rolling in it.

23:41.291 --> 23:42.708
[speaking foreign language]

23:42.750 --> 23:45.083
Just take it.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.708
Watch.

23:46.750 --> 23:49.958
Check... no check.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.166
I'll just write you another.

23:51.208 --> 23:53.416
Well, I will just do it again.

23:53.458 --> 23:54.791
I trust in you.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.000
You must learn to
trust in yourself.

24:00.208 --> 24:01.333
[speaking foreign language]

24:01.375 --> 24:02.666
[chuckles]

24:02.708 --> 24:05.000
[speaking foreign language]

24:05.041 --> 24:06.875
Oh, get a room,
the pair of you.

24:06.916 --> 24:07.875
Mind you, you'll have to
fight for space

24:07.916 --> 24:09.083
with the man from the market.

24:09.125 --> 24:11.375
- Oh?
- Shut up!

24:11.416 --> 24:12.708
Hey, have you got
a new boyfriend?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.916
No!

24:14.958 --> 24:16.291
Tell Mama. Has she?

24:16.333 --> 24:18.458
No, no, no. I mean,
he just gave her his number

24:18.500 --> 24:19.958
and he wants to
see her half naked,

24:20.000 --> 24:21.458
but no, definitely not.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.875
Hmmm. Is he blind
or mad or both?

24:24.916 --> 24:26.875
Oh, thanks, Mom.

24:26.916 --> 24:28.541
[speaking foreign language]
I'm joking.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.458
- Come on!
- Dawn-ka, listen to me.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.125
If you think Ethan
is a problem now,

24:32.166 --> 24:34.083
you wait until
I kick that bucket,

24:34.125 --> 24:36.666
and then you will really
have your work cut out.

24:36.708 --> 24:39.458
You are young.
[speaking foreign language]

24:52.625 --> 24:55.583
- Same again?
- Yeah. No, no, I'm fine.

24:55.625 --> 24:56.833
Yeah, go.

24:56.875 --> 24:57.916
You sure?

24:57.958 --> 24:58.916
You want to phone a friend?

24:58.958 --> 25:01.333
I want to phone a dickhead.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.958
You wanna use my phone?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.083
Oh.

25:05.208 --> 25:06.541
Oh. Am I the dickhead?

25:06.583 --> 25:09.583
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No. Don't be.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.375
It's my fault.

25:11.416 --> 25:13.833
I'm sorry I'm late.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.625
Might be normal,
for all I know.

25:15.666 --> 25:17.541
An hour after we said.

25:17.583 --> 25:18.708
I only go out
about once a decade,

25:18.750 --> 25:21.833
so I don't really know
the um... rules.

25:21.875 --> 25:24.833
Rule number one is, don't keep
a beautiful woman waiting.

25:24.875 --> 25:28.041
It was a work thing.
Still, no excuse.

25:34.666 --> 25:37.083
So, um, what do you do?

25:37.125 --> 25:39.291
- I'm a spy.
- No, you're not.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.375
- I'm an ice cream man.
- Oh, right.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.583
[chuckles]

25:43.625 --> 25:46.041
Well, I can see you in
the little vans, that's all...

25:46.083 --> 25:49.291
Listen, I'm not buying you
a drink until you're nice.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.291
Don't need one now.

25:52.833 --> 25:55.083
So. You thought
you were being stood up,

25:55.125 --> 25:56.625
but you were staying anyway.

25:56.666 --> 26:00.250
Well, don't let me stop you
if you've seen someone better.

26:00.291 --> 26:01.458
I'm staying because
I've got a babysitter,

26:01.500 --> 26:03.875
so I thought might as well.

26:03.916 --> 26:05.041
So, you've got kids then, eh?

26:05.083 --> 26:06.875
Be mad if I hadn't,
wouldn't it?

26:09.333 --> 26:13.250
No, one boy, 18.
He's autistic.

26:13.291 --> 26:16.000
- Oh. That must be nice for you.
- What?

26:16.041 --> 26:18.791
All the little pictures
he must draw.

26:21.500 --> 26:26.458
Sorry. That was
a terrible joke.

26:26.500 --> 26:27.750
I'll let you off.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.416
So, um, what about you?

26:34.458 --> 26:36.541
No, I'm rubbish at art.

26:39.791 --> 26:43.041
- Kids!
- Oh! No.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.958
Vodka and tonic. Cheers, mate.

26:46.500 --> 26:49.000
You look even better at night
than you do during the day.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.791
That's because
it's dark.

26:50.833 --> 26:52.541
Because you're gorgeous.

26:54.625 --> 26:57.541
[♪♪♪]

27:28.666 --> 27:30.583
I love you.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.541
I love you.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.791
Sorry. Sorry.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.125
I overslept.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.708
- I bet you did, you dirty tart.
- No.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.375
Is he a shouter?
I bet he is.

27:44.416 --> 27:47.125
You know, "Take it, take it,
take the lot!"

27:47.166 --> 27:49.416
He was extremely polite.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.416
Well, he didn't even wipe it
on your curtains, no?

27:51.458 --> 27:52.583
Well, he might have done it
in his own house

27:52.625 --> 27:54.000
because that's where he slept,
I presume,

27:54.041 --> 27:55.291
while I slept in mine.

27:55.333 --> 27:56.958
I'm so disappointed in you.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.041
I did get drunk though.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.958
First time since
the new year before last.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.500
What? And he didn't
take advantage?

28:05.541 --> 28:06.583
Gay!

28:06.625 --> 28:07.833
He's nice.

28:07.875 --> 28:10.000
And you'll think so too,
when I tell you me news.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.000
He fancied me
all along, didn't he?

28:12.041 --> 28:13.625
He's gonna be our backer.

28:13.666 --> 28:15.291
Backer as in...?

28:15.333 --> 28:17.166
The shop.

28:17.208 --> 28:18.708
Okay.

28:18.750 --> 28:21.208
That is nice, after one date.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.250
No, no, no.
It's what he does.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.208
What, just give money
to random strangers?

28:25.250 --> 28:28.208
No, no, no. He's um,
he's an investor bloke...

28:28.250 --> 28:30.541
a venture capitalist
or whatever.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.333
Although he said no
when I said that.

28:32.375 --> 28:33.500
Well, only small time.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.166
So not a twat then, no?

28:36.416 --> 28:38.125
Unless it's twatty

28:38.166 --> 28:40.708
to come up with
the 10 grand we need.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.541
- Well, just like that?
- No, no.

28:42.583 --> 28:45.208
He wants to meet us,
see the place and that.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.208
Well, when?

28:47.250 --> 28:50.416
Whenever!
Why are you not excited?

28:50.458 --> 28:52.083
I don't know.
I mean, I should be.

28:52.125 --> 28:54.583
I... I... oh, I am.

28:57.625 --> 29:00.375
But, we don't know
anything about him.

29:00.416 --> 29:02.083
Well, we didn't know anything
about bank wanker.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.583
No.

29:03.625 --> 29:07.625
Look, he bought me a meal.
He put me in a taxi.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.833
He didn't so much as
try it once.

29:09.875 --> 29:14.291
His name is Jeremy.
And he's a nice man.

29:22.458 --> 29:23.708
[car door closes]

29:23.750 --> 29:26.666
[birds chirping]

29:33.791 --> 29:35.125
Excuse me, can I help you?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.375
Who are you?
What the hell is going on here?

29:38.416 --> 29:39.666
That man just punched me
in the fucking face!

29:39.708 --> 29:41.250
I'm going to get the police!

29:41.291 --> 29:43.041
[grunt]

29:51.416 --> 29:54.250
Okay.
Go easy with this, right?

29:54.291 --> 29:56.708
You care more about your bike
than you do about me?

29:56.750 --> 29:59.708
Yeah. Exactly.
So be careful.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.583
Wait.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.791
No, I don't.

30:04.833 --> 30:07.541
Good. It means
I'm not wasting my time.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.000
Yeah, you are.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.083
See you later, smiley.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.916
[laughs]

30:40.083 --> 30:41.541
God, there's
loads of room up there,

30:41.583 --> 30:43.625
for you and your design room.

30:43.666 --> 30:45.708
More space than last time?

30:45.750 --> 30:47.333
Or the time before that?

30:47.375 --> 30:49.750
Uh, um, can I ask you
something?

30:49.791 --> 30:51.083
What?

30:51.125 --> 30:54.125
Are you always
such a complete snatch?

30:54.166 --> 30:56.375
Maybe you'd like to
wait outside.

30:56.416 --> 30:57.916
I wouldn't.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.833
Still...

31:14.583 --> 31:18.041
I bet he's amazing.
Dead spiteful.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.958
I'm just on High Street.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.916
Don't know,
some tire kickers.

31:23.958 --> 31:29.708
I reckon a big glass
cake cabinet here.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.541
The drinks chiller's
going there.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.125
Yeah, as well as I mean.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.958
Do you know what
I'm thinking now?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.583
I'm thinking a little
raised stage area here.

31:37.625 --> 31:40.083
We can hold little music nights
and poetry readings.

31:40.125 --> 31:42.625
Oh, yeah, yeah, because we're
massive, pretentious wankers.

31:42.666 --> 31:43.625
It'd cost though,
wouldn't it?

31:43.666 --> 31:44.666
Well, you've got to speculate.

31:44.708 --> 31:46.416
Hey, what do you think,
Jezbob?

31:46.458 --> 31:48.041
For the culture? You don't mind
if I call you Jezbob,

31:48.083 --> 31:49.541
do you?
I've heard worse.

31:49.583 --> 31:52.125
- Yeah? How bad?
- Bex!

31:52.166 --> 31:54.916
What? Johnny breath,
kitten dick?

31:54.958 --> 31:56.625
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.416
You'll let me know about
that last one, won't you?

31:58.458 --> 32:00.291
You'll have to
excuse my friend Rebecca.

32:00.333 --> 32:03.375
She has an unfortunate way.
Woo, totally passed me by.

32:03.416 --> 32:05.833
So, uh, um, Jezarino.
This... this... this money,

32:05.875 --> 32:07.208
it's on the straight, right?

32:07.250 --> 32:09.083
No.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.958
I'm just one of those weirdos
that likes standing around

32:11.000 --> 32:13.458
in empty shops
getting insulted.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.958
So how does it work? You know,
the um, the arrangements?

32:19.916 --> 32:22.500
You pay me back
on the dot every week

32:22.541 --> 32:23.958
or I break [yelling]
your fucking legs

32:24.000 --> 32:26.500
and then I start
on your faces!

32:28.458 --> 32:32.833
Ahhh...

32:32.875 --> 32:34.875
- I think I need a lady nappy.
- No, no!

32:34.916 --> 32:36.583
She doesn't, she doesn't!

32:36.625 --> 32:38.291
She's tight as an gnat.
Stop it!

32:38.333 --> 32:40.541
Don't tell people you're
wide, girl! Never!

32:46.541 --> 32:49.000
How long you going to be?

32:49.041 --> 32:51.208
Uh, are we
inconveniencing you?

32:51.250 --> 32:53.750
Yeah. You are.

32:53.791 --> 32:55.916
Ages then.

33:04.041 --> 33:06.375
Right.

33:06.416 --> 33:10.083
Ten grand from me.
You'll put five grand each in.

33:10.125 --> 33:12.416
If you need 20,000,'s enough
to get you started.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.958
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.208
Slow down now. I mean,
[sighs] what's the catch?

33:19.250 --> 33:21.250
What? [laughs]

33:21.291 --> 33:22.791
I want it back.

33:22.833 --> 33:24.583
Wh... when? How?

33:24.625 --> 33:25.875
Well, how long do you think

33:25.916 --> 33:27.583
before you get it
up and running, do you reckon?

33:27.625 --> 33:30.291
Um... uh, a month.

33:30.333 --> 33:31.875
Six weeks, tops.

33:31.916 --> 33:34.666
Start paying then.
A grand a month.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.875
[sighs] A grand's a bit steep.

33:41.833 --> 33:44.416
Uh, can I...
Can I have a minute?

33:44.458 --> 33:48.166
Yeah. Of course you can.
Take your time.

33:59.916 --> 34:03.208
It just might not leave us
loads for ourselves, to start.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.250
Oh, I mean, I guess it was
always going to be difficult,

34:05.291 --> 34:07.083
to begin with.
But a year down the line,

34:07.125 --> 34:09.750
we'll be keeping what we make.

34:09.791 --> 34:13.833
Um... I'm assuming we'll be
paying you for a year.

34:13.875 --> 34:15.333
Not quite.

34:15.375 --> 34:16.583
Well, we would pay you
interest though.

34:16.625 --> 34:17.666
There's no way we're not.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.958
- How many payments is that?
- Forty.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.041
- Forty grand?
- Forty months?

34:22.083 --> 34:23.583
Both correct.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.583
I should award
some little trophies.

34:25.625 --> 34:28.458
You want four times
what your lending us?

34:28.500 --> 34:31.875
Your math is amazing.
You're going to do so well.

34:31.916 --> 34:33.166
We can't pay you that.

34:33.208 --> 34:35.666
[snicker] He's setting us up.

34:35.708 --> 34:40.000
It's Jezzball, the joker.
I mean, 40 fucking grand!

34:43.375 --> 34:45.791
You know, I, uh...

34:47.583 --> 34:50.583
Well, is this what you do?
Is it?

34:50.625 --> 34:52.583
You make promises
to lonely women, is that it?

34:52.625 --> 34:53.833
I'm not lonely.

34:53.875 --> 34:55.250
Just so you can get a shag,
be the big I am,

34:55.291 --> 34:57.166
and then when she doesn't,

34:57.208 --> 34:58.541
you're gonna pull a stroke
like this on her?

34:58.583 --> 35:01.291
God, you're a dick!

35:01.333 --> 35:03.250
It's over!

35:03.291 --> 35:05.000
Not yet.

35:05.041 --> 35:06.916
Look, you don't want to do it,
that's up to you.

35:06.958 --> 35:08.416
I'm not going to force you.

35:08.458 --> 35:10.000
Well, that's very nice of you.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.916
Maybe you'll have better luck
next time with another bank.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.000
What do you care?

35:13.041 --> 35:15.833
But, there is
this small matter

35:15.875 --> 35:18.041
of the funds I've secured.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.875
- What funds?
- The £10,000.

35:20.916 --> 35:22.916
Which last night
you specifically said

35:22.958 --> 35:25.250
you wanted me to lend you.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.958
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. [snickers]

35:28.000 --> 35:30.083
"We've got ten.
We just need the other half."

35:30.125 --> 35:31.416
"I can get that for you."

35:31.458 --> 35:33.291
"Oh, my God! Yes, please.
That would be amazing."

35:33.333 --> 35:35.583
I've kept up my end.

35:35.625 --> 35:36.958
I'd had a drink.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.041
Look, I'm not going to
force the money on you,

35:40.083 --> 35:42.583
but there are costs
to me securing it.

35:42.625 --> 35:47.625
Hey, listen, I mean, once
you've paid the finder's fee

35:47.666 --> 35:49.250
and the cancellation policy...

35:49.291 --> 35:51.250
It's been set there for
90 seconds, you fucking tit!

35:51.291 --> 35:54.083
You've incurred
a few months' interest.

35:54.125 --> 35:57.166
You might as well take it.
It's there.

35:57.208 --> 36:01.541
You can touch it.
Start your business.

36:01.583 --> 36:04.000
When work is a pleasure,
life is joy.

36:04.041 --> 36:08.541
When work is duty,
life is slavery.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.708
I'll waive my charges,
by the way.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.208
Well, fair enough.
You're very good.

36:12.250 --> 36:13.625
Now I've got something
for you, yeah.

36:13.666 --> 36:17.541
Yeah, right here.
Here.

36:17.583 --> 36:20.083
Keep the change, all right?
Oh, one more thing.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.958
[kisses] Ah!

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
Enjoy that, ya penis.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.333
You don't think it's because
I called him names, do you?

36:56.375 --> 36:59.666
No. He's just...
[clicks tongue] a ball-bag.

36:59.708 --> 37:01.791
Seemed dead up front.

37:01.833 --> 37:04.833
"When work is a pleasure..."
I mean, what a prick!

37:04.875 --> 37:07.166
What was he on about,
we owe him money?

37:07.208 --> 37:09.208
He's just trying it on,
isn't he?

37:09.250 --> 37:11.791
Like I've got money
to be throwing away on him.

37:11.833 --> 37:14.666
Forget about it. I mean,
[sighs] what's he gonna do?

37:17.500 --> 37:20.000
Jesus!

37:27.458 --> 37:31.833
Left, right,
left, right, Liam.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.791
[♪♪♪]

38:07.166 --> 38:11.833
Hey, I didn't think
I'd see you today.

38:11.875 --> 38:15.041
I told you, didn't I?
You did, Lena, you did.

38:16.500 --> 38:19.125
Come on. Sit down.

38:20.916 --> 38:22.041
I'm fine.

38:22.083 --> 38:25.375
You don't look fine, Mishka.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.375
Hey, I've been
telling this one off

38:27.416 --> 38:28.750
because he doesn't
take you out.

38:29.958 --> 38:32.541
But I have a bone
to pick with you.

38:32.583 --> 38:36.291
Why didn't you tell your Mama
you have new boyfriend?

38:39.000 --> 38:40.500
Just happened to be here,
did you?

38:40.541 --> 38:44.916
You know me.
Don't work if I don't have to.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.000
I saw Ethan.
Recognized him from pictures.

38:48.041 --> 38:50.583
I don't remember
showing you any pictures.

38:50.625 --> 38:56.875
Oh. Well,
must be a good guesser then.

38:56.916 --> 38:59.458
- I'll go and get him.
- No!

38:59.500 --> 39:02.125
I could shout,
but it's a bit hit and miss.

39:02.166 --> 39:03.666
- [speaking foreign language]
- But you know it is.

39:03.708 --> 39:05.750
Leave him. I'll get him.
We need to go.

39:05.791 --> 39:06.958
[speaking foreign language]

39:07.000 --> 39:08.208
He's cold.

39:08.250 --> 39:11.083
[speaking foreign language]

39:12.875 --> 39:17.916
Well, I'll be off.
See you soon, Dawn.

39:17.958 --> 39:20.041
Really lovely
meeting you, Lena.

39:20.083 --> 39:23.041
The pleasure is mine.

39:23.083 --> 39:25.666
[shouting] Looking forward to
meeting you properly, Ethan.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.666
Ciao.

39:30.708 --> 39:32.000
Bye-bye.

39:32.041 --> 39:35.958
[phone rings]

39:36.000 --> 39:38.875
Uh, yeah, Dawn.
Look, can I, um...

39:38.916 --> 39:41.791
uh, can I call you
a bit later?

39:41.833 --> 39:43.708
Okay. Thanks, love.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.541
Said he thought
they were waiting for him.

40:02.958 --> 40:04.458
Oh, it might not have been
a "they."

40:04.500 --> 40:06.583
It might have just been one.
You know what blokes are like.

40:06.625 --> 40:09.541
Fucking ten men.
Took them all on.

40:12.708 --> 40:14.500
You know, he just went to go
and get the bike to pick us up.

40:14.541 --> 40:18.500
They put a bag on his head...
a plastic one.

40:20.208 --> 40:22.791
He could be dead
right now, Dawn.

40:28.916 --> 40:30.125
All right then.

40:30.166 --> 40:34.083
Don't be shy if anything
comes back to you.

40:44.125 --> 40:46.250
You didn't tell them much.

40:46.291 --> 40:48.750
There's not much to tell.

40:48.791 --> 40:50.625
You told me more.

40:52.416 --> 40:54.958
There's no point, is there?

41:00.125 --> 41:05.000
I'm sick of this place.
Let's go.

41:05.041 --> 41:06.958
I think we better
ask the doctor first.

41:10.166 --> 41:11.958
Well, ask, please.

41:14.125 --> 41:17.125
This town is a shithole.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.166
It's our shithole.
We live here.

41:23.208 --> 41:27.083
We don't have to.
We can live anywhere.

41:28.666 --> 41:31.083
We belong here.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.833
That's why I came back,
you know.

41:36.458 --> 41:39.625
I don't want this to sound...
harsh...

41:39.666 --> 41:44.958
but we've only been together
for five months,

41:45.000 --> 41:47.916
and I've... I've known Dawn
for a lot longer.

41:47.958 --> 41:51.708
I cannot, I cannot leave her
in this shit again.

41:51.750 --> 41:55.125
They'll kill me
next time.

41:55.166 --> 41:57.041
What?

42:00.416 --> 42:02.208
They knew things.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.166
He knew things.

42:06.666 --> 42:09.083
He?

42:10.750 --> 42:12.875
[sobs] The guy
from the market.

42:14.041 --> 42:15.875
He knew my name.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.041
Where I lived.

42:19.083 --> 42:24.583
He knows you.
Where you live.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.625
[sobs] All sorts of things.

42:26.666 --> 42:28.750
I-I thought you said
he never spoke.

42:28.791 --> 42:33.750
Well, he did!
[sobs] He spoke plenty...

42:37.041 --> 42:40.375
About what would happen
if I go to the police.

42:40.416 --> 42:44.916
You don't believe him?
Don't do it.

42:44.958 --> 42:48.083
Don't you fucking dare! Right?

42:48.125 --> 42:50.250
Okay, love, okay.

42:50.291 --> 42:52.666
[sputters]

42:52.708 --> 42:54.958
Oh God! It's okay.

42:57.333 --> 43:00.291
[sobs]

43:19.708 --> 43:22.625
[muffled groans]

43:26.250 --> 43:29.125
[groaning, crying]

43:32.791 --> 43:34.125
Your payment's due.

43:34.166 --> 43:36.750
[yelling]
I don't owe you any money!

43:41.458 --> 43:45.125
- I say you do.
- [grunting]

43:45.166 --> 43:48.000
Let's have more of a can-do
attitude, shall we?

43:48.041 --> 43:49.458
[sobs]

43:49.500 --> 43:51.083
I could have come asking
for the cash first,

43:51.125 --> 43:52.750
but I find my business
works better

43:52.791 --> 43:54.833
when the warnings
come unannounced.

43:54.875 --> 43:57.375
[groans]

43:59.541 --> 44:01.208
[sobs] I knew it was you!

44:02.583 --> 44:04.125
You could have killed him.

44:04.166 --> 44:06.958
You're right, I could.
I could have done anything.

44:07.000 --> 44:08.750
I told him not to tell anyone.

44:08.791 --> 44:10.250
Might need to have
another word.

44:10.291 --> 44:14.166
Yeah, well, good luck.
He is gone. He is gone!

44:14.208 --> 44:17.708
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm glad you stayed.

44:17.750 --> 44:21.833
Three now. Grand.

44:21.875 --> 44:24.291
- You didn't lend me anything.
- Yes, I did.

44:24.333 --> 44:25.791
Albeit briefly.

44:25.833 --> 44:29.375
Like I said, there's
charges to consider.

44:29.416 --> 44:33.125
Plus... I gave you my goodwill.

44:34.541 --> 44:38.958
And right now, I'd say
that was priceless.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.916
[crying]

44:44.833 --> 44:50.541
Oh God! I...
I don't have that kind...

44:50.583 --> 44:52.041
that kind of money.
Yeah, you do.

44:52.083 --> 44:54.333
You've got five grand.

44:57.375 --> 44:59.458
There is another way.

44:59.500 --> 45:02.291
[sobs] Let's do that, then.
Let's do that.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.208
It would take you
a while though.

45:04.250 --> 45:07.166
It's okay.
What is it?

45:13.708 --> 45:15.666
Fuck off!

45:15.708 --> 45:19.625
[groans]

45:19.666 --> 45:22.000
It's okay.

45:25.166 --> 45:27.166
But now it's five.

45:27.208 --> 45:29.333
Hang on a minute.

45:29.375 --> 45:31.458
Five enough.

45:32.833 --> 45:35.166
Face it.

45:35.208 --> 45:36.958
Come on.

45:37.000 --> 45:42.125
[whistles]

45:42.166 --> 45:43.791

45:43.833 --> 45:46.750

45:51.708 --> 45:54.625
[♪♪♪]

46:10.500 --> 46:13.166
[no audible dialogue]

46:25.500 --> 46:26.833
Where have you been?

46:26.875 --> 46:29.333
Work. [sighs]

46:29.375 --> 46:31.833
Need more details?

46:39.875 --> 46:41.833
Will you tell our daughter
to get ready for bed?

46:41.875 --> 46:45.000
Get ready for bed, darling.

46:47.083 --> 46:50.041
Is that top new?

46:50.083 --> 46:53.458
- Yeah.
- Do they have it in navy?

46:53.500 --> 46:55.458
Check.

47:14.208 --> 47:17.125
- Bex!
- [sobs]

47:35.416 --> 47:38.083
Lock it.

47:50.833 --> 47:53.791
I've been trying to
ring you for ages.

47:56.333 --> 47:58.541
[Bex sobs]

47:58.583 --> 48:01.541
It's all right.
It's all right.

48:01.583 --> 48:04.083
It's over.
It's finished.

48:04.125 --> 48:07.333
[groans]
Does it look finished?

48:07.375 --> 48:10.333
Does it?
He's a fucking psycho!

48:10.375 --> 48:13.708
No. No.
I've solved it.

48:13.750 --> 48:16.250
He's gone.

48:16.291 --> 48:21.750
He's never... he's never
gonna bother us again.

48:21.791 --> 48:24.333
I've paid him me five grand,
and...

48:24.375 --> 48:27.833
And he said he'd accept it
as full and final payment.

48:27.875 --> 48:29.250
I can't have anything
happen to me mom or Ethan.

48:29.291 --> 48:32.083
They've not done anything.

48:32.125 --> 48:34.708
So, that's the end of it.

48:37.125 --> 48:39.083
I can save it up again.

48:39.125 --> 48:41.541
It... it might take a while,
but I will.

48:41.583 --> 48:43.208
We could open up
a café next year,

48:43.250 --> 48:45.500
or the year after.

48:49.833 --> 48:52.041
I've done it.

48:52.083 --> 48:54.458
I've done it for us, Bex.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.916
It's over.

49:00.541 --> 49:03.416
[church bells toll]

49:26.833 --> 49:28.625
Where is it?

49:33.958 --> 49:36.250
[whispers] Where is it?

49:37.375 --> 49:40.875
Where's what?

49:40.916 --> 49:43.833
[heavy breathing]

49:45.750 --> 49:48.125
Where is it?

49:48.166 --> 49:51.041
[heavy breathing]

49:53.875 --> 49:55.750
I don't...
I don't know what you mean.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.500
Where's my money?

50:04.583 --> 50:05.875
I paid you!

50:08.125 --> 50:10.708
I left it in the box
where you said the box was,

50:10.750 --> 50:13.000
where you left your number.

50:13.041 --> 50:17.041
I hid it where you said.
[heavy breathing]

50:17.083 --> 50:19.291
At the market, in the stall.

50:19.333 --> 50:21.583
The deadline was this morning.

50:26.625 --> 50:28.916
[heavy breathing]
I left it.

50:30.958 --> 50:35.250
You bastard!
You know it was there.

50:35.291 --> 50:38.125
£6000.

50:38.166 --> 50:39.791
[yelling]
I've got nothing left!

50:42.791 --> 50:44.791
You'll find a way.

50:50.625 --> 50:53.041
[screams]

50:54.666 --> 50:56.625
[snickers]

50:56.666 --> 50:58.166
Amazing!

50:58.208 --> 51:01.125
[evil laugh]

51:14.166 --> 51:16.208
[on phone] Hiya.
Hiya, Bex.

51:16.250 --> 51:20.875
Um, can you do tomorrow?
I've got a sore throat.

51:20.916 --> 51:22.833
What we like...

51:22.875 --> 51:26.166
Anyway, um, I hope you've had
a good rest, and I'll...

51:32.208 --> 51:35.125

[pounding on door]

52:33.833 --> 52:34.875
Hi, how you feeling?

52:34.916 --> 52:36.291
I'm all right.
I'll come back tomorrow.

52:41.625 --> 52:43.166
- Oooh!
- Just need a day, you know.

52:43.208 --> 52:46.208
[sighs] Yeah.
Uh, do you have any whiskey?

52:46.250 --> 52:48.291
I'll make you
one of my famous toddies.

52:48.333 --> 52:49.500
No.

52:49.541 --> 52:50.625
Do... do you want
to nip out and get some?

52:50.666 --> 52:51.541
No, no, no.
We'll make do.

52:51.583 --> 52:53.041
Hey, how's Ethan?

52:53.083 --> 52:54.625
- He's in his bed.
- He's not with grandma?

52:54.666 --> 52:56.000
No. Not today.

52:59.458 --> 53:03.708
[footsteps]

53:06.416 --> 53:08.250
[heavy breathing]

53:08.291 --> 53:09.958
You have a sore throat,
do you?

53:10.000 --> 53:11.916
Try taking his fucking cock
out of it.

53:11.958 --> 53:14.500
She has now, thanks to you.

53:14.541 --> 53:15.625
You got my 5-1/2?

53:15.666 --> 53:17.833
You!

53:17.875 --> 53:19.250
- [smack]
- Oh!

53:19.291 --> 53:22.333
[groans]

53:22.375 --> 53:23.291
Now why did you do...

53:23.333 --> 53:24.500
[bash]

53:24.541 --> 53:25.958
[groans]

53:26.000 --> 53:28.125
Argh!

53:43.583 --> 53:46.583
[snickers]

53:46.625 --> 53:48.583
Whew!

53:48.625 --> 53:50.916
A little bit inconvenient, this.

53:50.958 --> 53:53.041
Thanks for trying.
But the debt still stands.

53:53.083 --> 53:54.500
But y-you said...

53:54.541 --> 53:58.625
[yelling] I'm saying the debt
still st-a-a-a-a-nds!

54:03.166 --> 54:06.208
Cash only.

54:06.250 --> 54:07.666
Love to your mom.

54:15.625 --> 54:18.541
[sighs]

54:26.958 --> 54:29.833
Don't.

54:29.875 --> 54:32.083
He tried that on me, too,
you know.

54:32.125 --> 54:34.416
And you didn't go for it.

54:34.458 --> 54:36.000
Well, well done, you.

54:37.958 --> 54:42.125
You said it was over, Dawn.

54:42.166 --> 54:43.875
Look at me.

54:43.916 --> 54:47.416
I'd rather not.
I'm sorting it.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.250
[laughs] What do you mean?

54:49.291 --> 54:52.208
I wasn't fucking him for fun.

54:52.250 --> 54:53.250
You think a ride's
going to fix this?

54:53.291 --> 54:55.958
Oh, no. No, I don't.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.916
I need to do it
again and again and ag...

54:59.958 --> 55:02.333
And again, and I would.

55:02.375 --> 55:03.541
Do you know why?

55:12.583 --> 55:14.333
He knows where she works.

55:14.375 --> 55:15.916
He knows where she lives.

55:20.166 --> 55:21.916
You know he's not
pretending, Bex.

55:21.958 --> 55:23.083
This is what he does,

55:23.125 --> 55:24.708
and he's just gonna
go on and on and on.

55:24.750 --> 55:27.875
I can't stand it.

55:27.916 --> 55:30.500
I'd go to the police, but...

55:30.541 --> 55:32.333
I'm too scared.

55:35.500 --> 55:38.208
I want it all to just go away,
and [sobs]

55:38.250 --> 55:41.041
I want it all to be
dull and shit again.

55:43.291 --> 55:45.666
Do you not think I want to give
me son the life he deserves?

55:45.708 --> 55:50.875
So yeah, yeah, I'd do it,
as much as it took,

55:50.916 --> 55:53.541
but now you've gone
and fucked it up.

55:53.583 --> 55:54.708
I was doin' it my way.

55:54.750 --> 55:56.000
Yes, Dawn.

55:56.041 --> 55:57.875
It's your way, Dawn,
that got us in this state.

55:57.916 --> 55:59.291
[sobs] I thought
he was all right.

55:59.333 --> 56:02.500
Yeah. That's 'cause you're
a stupid fucking bitch!

56:02.541 --> 56:05.416
Well, so are you [sobs]
for getting involved.

56:05.458 --> 56:08.666
I'm getting
uninvolved right now.

56:08.708 --> 56:10.208
You know what, I should never
have come back here.

56:10.250 --> 56:11.416
Liam is right.

56:11.458 --> 56:12.500
[yelling] This place
is a fucking shithole!

56:12.541 --> 56:13.541
So are you.

56:13.583 --> 56:15.333
Oh, I'm done with you!

56:15.375 --> 56:16.333
Well, fuck off!

56:16.375 --> 56:18.166
Aw, fuck you!

56:18.208 --> 56:19.333
[door slams]

56:21.666 --> 56:24.583
[sobs]

56:35.958 --> 56:38.875
[crying]

56:53.416 --> 56:55.125
I'll make you that hot toddy.

56:55.166 --> 56:57.583
[sobs]

56:57.625 --> 56:59.125
I'm sorry.

57:10.458 --> 57:13.125
Someone will be with you
as soon as they can.

57:13.166 --> 57:14.541
[sighs]

57:18.708 --> 57:20.333
[screams] Help me!

57:27.541 --> 57:29.208
Ten minutes, girls.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.875
[phone rings]

57:39.750 --> 57:42.208
Open it.
It can only help us.

57:44.833 --> 57:46.250
[gasps]

57:52.458 --> 57:55.208
Bastard!

57:55.250 --> 57:58.250
I don't care.

57:58.291 --> 58:00.708
[sighs]

58:02.500 --> 58:04.750
[phone rings]

58:21.333 --> 58:25.916
It's pathetic.
Just ignore it.

58:25.958 --> 58:27.291
I mean, who's going to
see it anyway?

58:27.333 --> 58:30.916
You know, half his mates and
a farmer in Venezuela.

58:30.958 --> 58:32.125
You know, I mean,
it's not ideal,

58:32.166 --> 58:33.375
but it's not gonna
make the news.

58:33.416 --> 58:35.333
It's not that.
It's her.

58:35.375 --> 58:37.583
Dickhead's mum.
Ethan's nan.

58:37.625 --> 58:39.208
I thought she was
out of the picture.

58:39.250 --> 58:40.750
She's only out of the picture
because she's got nothing on me.

58:40.791 --> 58:42.083
But he lost the case, Dawn.

58:45.208 --> 58:48.250
[sobs] I can't go through
with all that again.

58:48.291 --> 58:51.375
Every year, every year, I still
get a Ch-Christmas card saying,

58:51.416 --> 58:52.500
"I'll get you, you bitch.

58:52.541 --> 58:54.208
You'll know what
it's like to lose a son."

58:54.250 --> 58:56.000
I might be combining a few
there, but you get me drift.

58:56.041 --> 58:57.458
[sobs]

58:57.500 --> 59:01.125
Oh, she was always
very stable.

59:01.166 --> 59:02.833
It'll kill me mum
if she found out.

59:02.875 --> 59:04.708
[sighs]

59:16.375 --> 59:18.666
[whispers] Go!

59:20.083 --> 59:21.541
Of course, you can meet me.
Yeah.

59:21.583 --> 59:23.666
I'm a bit busy now though.

59:23.708 --> 59:24.916
Yeah. I'll be in touch.

59:48.291 --> 59:49.458
Stop.

59:51.916 --> 59:55.833
What are you worried about?
It's not even Friday yet.

59:55.875 --> 59:57.333
Sit down.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:31.250
Five grand.

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:33.791
It doesn't even cover
what you owe.

01:00:33.833 --> 01:00:35.083
Never mind her.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:36.708
It was a joint agreement.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.125
Joint agreement?

01:00:39.166 --> 01:00:43.000
What am I, a building society?

01:00:43.041 --> 01:00:45.583
I've probably got
more morals than them.

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:51.125
Anyway, I don't remember
you doing much agreeing.

01:00:51.166 --> 01:00:55.750
Well, we are doing now.
If you'll take that, please.

01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:57.541
It's five grand for nothing.

01:00:57.583 --> 01:01:02.916
Nothing... nothing?

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:05.541
You're forgetting
all the work I've put in.

01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:11.833
Mental and physical, including
jumping your rancid bones.

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:13.250
Nobody forced you.

01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:14.458
You did kind of beg.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.083
Just leave her alone,
will you?

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:18.791
Aw-w-w-w, touching.

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:29.041
[sighs] Well, who am I
to deny some little spastic

01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:32.458
a day at the roller coasters.

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.833
Right?

01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:38.875
That's it?

01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:41.166
Am I leaving?

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:42.583
Good job.

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:05.791
[panting]

01:02:09.041 --> 01:02:12.125
[moans]

01:02:12.166 --> 01:02:13.208
Well, I wouldn't have thought

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.000
you could fit
another person there.

01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.750
Tell you what though,
this woman lives at the Humbley.

01:02:17.791 --> 01:02:20.041
Pretty ways down the back end
so you can hammer the bends.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:30.833
You moving in there permanently
or are you coming out?

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:35.625
[sobs]

01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:37.000
[screams]

01:02:37.041 --> 01:02:40.291
I don't do deals.
I don't do favors.

01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:42.458
You don't ask to meet me

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.791
and tell me how much
you're gonna pay.

01:02:44.833 --> 01:02:46.666
[yelling]
Who do you think you are?

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:50.541
You entered into an agreement!

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.750
[sobs] No! Stop!

01:02:52.791 --> 01:02:53.750
Please!

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.125
£10,000.

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:57.958
[screaming]

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.541
You got an easy five.
You just need the same again.

01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:04.416
Sell the bike.
Remortgage the house.

01:03:04.458 --> 01:03:08.583
Steal. Suck off dogs.
I don't care what you do.

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:10.166
[sobs]

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:19.500
[gasping] I can't,
I can't, I can't.

01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:20.791
I think you can!

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:23.500
[sobs]

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:25.125
I can't do it!
No?

01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:27.708
[sobs]

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.291
[moans] Oh shit!

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:44.916
There's nothing more
you can do to me.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:47.791
[snickers]
Of course there is.

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:49.458
There's loads.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.833
[sighs]

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:55.666
[coughing] Like what?

01:03:55.708 --> 01:03:59.166
What do you think I should do?

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:00.875
[coughing] Change your career.

01:04:00.916 --> 01:04:05.083
[snickers] I did... to this.

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:06.583
What did you do before?

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:08.125
I did this before.

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:10.375
Sort of.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:11.916
Worked for a finance company.

01:04:11.958 --> 01:04:14.625
Arranged loans, other stuff.

01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:17.333
Decent rates of interest,
all very fair.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.875
Boring. Hardly paid.

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.125
I don't like using these.

01:04:26.666 --> 01:04:30.166
Too loud and I can never
work them properly.

01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:33.041
Always a last resort for me.

01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:36.833
[sobs] Why? Why do you
have to do this?

01:04:36.875 --> 01:04:41.208
Because I never want
to be poor... ever again.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.458
But mainly...
[cocks gun]

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.000
Because
I'm really good at it.

01:04:48.041 --> 01:04:50.166

[dog barks]

01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.708
[knock on door]

01:08:24.916 --> 01:08:25.957
Keeping you up?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
No.

01:08:28.041 --> 01:08:29.750
How's your ear?

01:08:29.791 --> 01:08:31.582
Pardon?

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:35.375
[snickers]
You are in good spirits.

01:08:35.416 --> 01:08:38.000
Am I about to be?

01:08:38.041 --> 01:08:40.416
Nearly there.

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:42.082
How far short is "nearly?"

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:43.791
Hundreds, not thousands.

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:52.707
What's this?

01:08:56.791 --> 01:08:58.166
Hundreds.

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:01.916
[snickers]

01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:03.666

01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:14.791
Where's my money?

01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:16.750
Safe.

01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.166
It'll be safe
once I've got it.

01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:26.041
Do you think
I brought you here...

01:09:26.082 --> 01:09:28.541
To piss you off?

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.041
That'd be a mistake.

01:09:40.666 --> 01:09:42.625
Hundreds, yeah?

01:09:42.666 --> 01:09:44.500
Yeah.

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:47.332
That's a lot.

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:48.875
We're gonna do a lot.

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:56.125
Hey!

01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:00.416
I don't like a tease.
