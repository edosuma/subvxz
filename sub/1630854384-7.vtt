WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.005
I don't play about my money

00:06.005 --> 00:07.907
and I don't play
about my -- blood.

00:07.907 --> 00:11.111
[Karen]<i> Previously, on Sistas.</i>

00:11.111 --> 00:12.479
The one you messing with
right now.

00:12.479 --> 00:14.047
-That's your blood?
-Yeah, that's my blood baby.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.315
You feeling me now.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.950
I don't know
if I'll ever be in love

00:16.950 --> 00:18.718
with anybody again in my life.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.821
I'm sorry you feel that way
but I understand.

00:21.821 --> 00:23.323
What do you need?

00:23.323 --> 00:26.993
I don't know Andi, these favors
can be pretty costly.

00:26.993 --> 00:28.461
Yeah, you better watch who you
talking to.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.530
You better [imitates vibrating]
go get that vibrator.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.865
Hi.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.466
Um, I'm looking for Zac.

00:33.466 --> 00:34.534
I'm Fatima.

00:36.017 --> 00:37.485
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

00:37.485 --> 00:39.420
-You're pretty.
-Thank you.

00:41.022 --> 00:43.458
Well, it looks like we have
someone else to join us.

00:45.993 --> 00:48.396
Hi.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.232
-Aaron.
-How you doing Fatima?

00:51.232 --> 00:53.034
I'm good. How are you?

00:53.034 --> 00:55.103
Good.

00:55.103 --> 00:57.305
Karen?

00:57.305 --> 00:59.373
[sighs]

00:59.373 --> 01:02.577
Welcome to my home.

01:04.112 --> 01:06.447
Uh, why don't you have a seat,
right here?

01:06.447 --> 01:07.782
Thank you.

01:07.782 --> 01:10.218
I thought you wasn't coming.

01:10.218 --> 01:12.520
I wasn't.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.956
Then, why did you?

01:14.956 --> 01:17.859
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:17.859 --> 01:19.460
Just sit, just sit, just sit.

01:19.460 --> 01:22.130
'Cause I thought
it was a good idea.

01:22.130 --> 01:24.866
I think it's a good idea, too.

01:26.701 --> 01:30.104
So, am I the only person that
don't think this is a good idea?

01:30.104 --> 01:32.507
Zac, please.

01:33.508 --> 01:36.077
You not gonna kiss me?

01:36.077 --> 01:37.879
Of course.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.818
Fatima, I think
you're just in time.

01:43.818 --> 01:45.153
Am I?

01:45.153 --> 01:49.190
Yeah, Karen was just about to
tell Zac how she feels.

01:49.190 --> 01:50.691
Momma.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.828

Did Zac tell you?

02:13.584 --> 02:17.654
Kinda, yeah, but, but I would
love to hear it from you.

02:17.654 --> 02:22.493
Well, this is
the love of my life.

02:22.493 --> 02:26.363
And I never, ever,
ever want her to hurt.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.832
She's my baby girl.

02:28.832 --> 02:30.868
I understand that.

02:30.868 --> 02:33.604
-Do you have children?
-No.

02:33.604 --> 02:37.741
-No, not yet.
-[Lisa] Okay.

02:37.741 --> 02:42.546
Okay, well, as much as you think
you understand,

02:42.546 --> 02:44.314
wait 'till you have children.

02:44.314 --> 02:49.386
Because it's magnified a
thousand times more.

02:49.386 --> 02:55.025
Just really never want them to
ever feel bad or to hurt.

02:55.025 --> 02:57.728
Oh, of course.

02:57.728 --> 03:00.163
And when I found out that she
was pregnant

03:00.163 --> 03:03.433
and in this situation,

03:03.433 --> 03:06.136
I thought it best if,

03:06.136 --> 03:09.406
she wrote a letter to each of
the people

03:09.406 --> 03:14.545
and read it to them,
explaining how she feels.

03:14.545 --> 03:16.380
That's a really good idea.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.448
Thanks, I do too.

03:18.448 --> 03:22.019
That way she doesn't forget what
she needs to say.

03:22.019 --> 03:24.288
Exactly.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.923
I got it from Oprah.

03:25.923 --> 03:29.493
[laughs]

03:29.493 --> 03:33.130
So, we're all on the same page
now, right?

03:33.130 --> 03:37.868
Yeah, we are and um,
speaking of pages,

03:37.868 --> 03:40.003
I have one of my own, too.

03:40.003 --> 03:41.505
-[Lisa] Oh, you do?
<i>-</i> Yeah.

03:41.505 --> 03:43.340
What?

03:43.340 --> 03:46.076
Yeah, do we all get to say
something

03:46.076 --> 03:47.811
or just Karen?

03:47.811 --> 03:49.379
Not right now.

03:49.379 --> 03:52.316
Right now,
it's just about Karen.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.451
It's always about Karen.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.353
You know, mom, I actually,

03:56.353 --> 03:57.721
I want to hear what she has to
say.

03:57.721 --> 03:59.423
-No, honey.
-No, I do, I mean...

03:59.423 --> 04:01.191
-She'll get her chance.
-Alright.

04:01.191 --> 04:03.260
Everybody will get a chance.

04:03.260 --> 04:04.695
It's always about her.

04:04.695 --> 04:06.797
But she's the one that's
stressed.

04:06.797 --> 04:08.799
She's the one that's having the
roughest time, I think.

04:08.799 --> 04:12.069
So, it's just for her.

04:12.069 --> 04:13.570
Okay?

04:13.570 --> 04:14.972
Momma, I'm not sure I can do
this.

04:14.972 --> 04:17.240
You can do this.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.243
You can, come on.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.346
You need to not stress any more.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.782
So, come on.

04:29.286 --> 04:32.255
Is there a reason you looking
at me like that?

04:32.255 --> 04:33.624
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

04:33.624 --> 04:35.292
I'm sorry.
How am I looking at you, Karen?

04:35.292 --> 04:37.027
Mm-mm.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.096
Alright, just stop.

04:39.096 --> 04:40.263
Stop, stop.

04:40.263 --> 04:42.766
Just read your letter, baby.

04:42.766 --> 04:44.534
Go on.

04:45.602 --> 04:50.440
Zac, one day I wondered why I
started

04:50.440 --> 04:54.378
hating butterflies so much.

04:54.378 --> 04:58.448
Then, I remembered the day we
met.

04:58.448 --> 05:03.420
On the train, a butterfly got on
and you ran.

05:03.420 --> 05:05.589
Like a bitch.

05:05.589 --> 05:07.457
The whole train was laughing so
hard

05:07.457 --> 05:10.360
when you literally, fell on me.

05:13.430 --> 05:17.601
But now, every time I see one

05:17.601 --> 05:19.903
I don't even see
the beauty in it.

05:21.171 --> 05:24.941
All I feel is a crushing weight.

05:24.941 --> 05:29.046
And that's exactly what being
with you is like.

05:29.046 --> 05:31.915
Everything that was supposed to
be beautiful,

05:31.915 --> 05:37.187
and I mean everything, you have
ruined for me.

05:37.187 --> 05:41.625
I hate that I have this man that
wants me to love him

05:41.625 --> 05:44.728
but when I see him, I see you.

05:44.728 --> 05:48.732
I hate that I have wasted three
years of my life,

05:48.732 --> 05:51.134
hoping that you would change.

05:51.134 --> 05:55.939
Hoping that you would give even
a fraction of what you took.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.075
That you wouldn't cheat with
your co-workers

05:58.075 --> 05:59.576
and your strippers.

05:59.576 --> 06:04.147
That you would decide not to
hurt me again and again

06:04.147 --> 06:06.883
and again.

06:06.883 --> 06:11.054
And I hate that after all that,
I still trusted you.

06:11.054 --> 06:15.459
I hate that I spent so much of
my hard earned money on you,

06:15.459 --> 06:17.294
of all people.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.030
But I kept saying to myself,

06:20.030 --> 06:24.501
"Just hold him down,
he's gonna get better."

06:24.501 --> 06:27.037
"He's gonna do better by you."

06:27.037 --> 06:29.172
But you never did.

06:29.172 --> 06:30.674
And you know why?

06:30.674 --> 06:32.776
'Cause you never wanted to.

06:32.776 --> 06:35.545
That's why you never got better.

06:35.545 --> 06:37.080
Yo, this ain't,
this ain't fair, yo.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.082
-Zac.
-No, it's not.

06:39.082 --> 06:40.150
Just let her finish.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.284
What, what am I doing?

06:41.284 --> 06:42.919
And why am I here?

06:42.919 --> 06:44.221
Why?

06:44.221 --> 06:45.789
Just let her finish.

06:48.458 --> 06:54.564
Now, I'm pregnant.

06:54.564 --> 06:57.534
And I just know that this is
your baby.

06:57.534 --> 06:59.836
And I want it to be.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.872
I can't even enjoy this moment,

07:01.872 --> 07:05.542
what's supposed to be the
happiest moment of my life,

07:05.542 --> 07:08.945
because this is not what it's
supposed to look like.

07:10.814 --> 07:15.318
As much as I don't want you, I
still want you.

07:15.318 --> 07:17.854
And that makes me so mad.

07:17.854 --> 07:21.792
It makes me so -- sick
because of all this dysfunction

07:21.792 --> 07:24.361
that you put me through for no
good reason.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.796
I don't even know how to let a
good man,

07:25.796 --> 07:30.634
an actual good man, love me.

07:30.634 --> 07:33.103
I don't even know what a healthy
relationship looks like.

07:33.904 --> 07:35.939
-This.
-You see Momma?

07:35.939 --> 07:37.607
This is why I didn't
want to do this.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.142
This is exactly why I didn't
want to do this.

07:39.142 --> 07:40.610
It's alright, I understand.
But come on.

07:40.610 --> 07:42.512
-[Zac] What?
-Zac, come on.

07:42.512 --> 07:44.047
-Zac.
-What?

07:44.047 --> 07:46.483
-Don't, don't do that.
-What am I doing?

07:46.483 --> 07:47.884
Then why am I here?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.487
Like, why, why do I
gotta do this?

07:50.487 --> 07:52.455
-Can't we just listen?
-I'm listening.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.758
She bashing the shit out of me.

07:54.758 --> 07:56.526
Talking about all the bad times.

07:56.526 --> 07:57.861
Didn't mention
none of the good times.

07:57.861 --> 08:00.931
Or the fact that I did try to
give her some money.

08:00.931 --> 08:03.700
Or the fact that I hated
that I couldn't provide.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.069
And I even told her that.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.406
Or the fact that I gave her
75 thousand -- dollars.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.740
Not enough.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.676
No, my whole life has been like
this with women.

08:12.676 --> 08:14.678
I wonder why.

08:14.678 --> 08:18.348
Every single one, from my mother
to every girl after that,

08:18.348 --> 08:19.683
been just like this.

08:19.683 --> 08:21.351
Hey, look at me.

08:21.351 --> 08:22.619
Look at me.

08:22.619 --> 08:24.487
I'm looking.

08:24.487 --> 08:26.656
Just calm down.

08:28.191 --> 08:30.894
Can you just listen?

08:30.894 --> 08:35.065
Do you want me to listen or you
just want to hear?

08:35.065 --> 08:37.000
Can we do both?

08:38.068 --> 08:40.237
Why?

08:42.138 --> 08:46.142
Zac, let's just listen to what
she has to say, okay?

08:46.142 --> 08:48.712
Whatever. Whatever.

08:48.712 --> 08:50.881
Come on, Zac, she just has a
little bit more.

08:53.316 --> 08:55.485
Go ahead.

08:55.485 --> 08:57.687
[Lisa]<i> Go on, baby.</i>

09:00.624 --> 09:03.093
I want to be done with you.

09:03.093 --> 09:06.396
And I want to
move on with my life.

09:06.396 --> 09:10.533
But now, with this baby,

09:10.533 --> 09:12.535
you might always be in my life.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.908
And I don't know if I can do
that.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.186
I'm done, that's all
I want to say.

09:30.186 --> 09:34.157
Okay, well, that's enough.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.393
You said I would feel better,
Momma.

09:36.393 --> 09:38.962
I don't feel better.

09:38.962 --> 09:42.699
You will, give it a little time.

09:45.568 --> 09:48.471
That's good. Can I go?

09:48.471 --> 09:50.407
Don't you have anything to say?

09:50.407 --> 09:51.942
No.

09:51.942 --> 09:53.643
[Lisa]<i> Nothing at all?</i>

09:55.145 --> 09:56.880
Nothing.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.616
Okay.

09:59.616 --> 10:01.284
Aaron?

10:04.854 --> 10:08.525
Karen, I know you feel, uh,

10:08.525 --> 10:11.828
I know you feel pretty bad,
right now.

10:11.828 --> 10:16.232
Honestly, I just want to say
thank you for saying all this.

10:18.802 --> 10:21.771
Um, I think this is the clearest
you've ever been.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.074
And I really appreciate that.

10:25.709 --> 10:30.714
And as, uh, difficult
as it was to hear,

10:30.714 --> 10:35.018
I guess, I feel like
I needed it.

10:36.086 --> 10:39.823
And honestly, even with all of
this, I still love you.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.328
I'm still gonna be here for you.

10:45.328 --> 10:50.900
And look, I, I'm not here to
compete with Zac.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.537
That's 'cause you can't.

10:54.537 --> 10:56.606
Because he has
a piece of your heart.

10:56.606 --> 10:59.943
And I respect that.

10:59.943 --> 11:01.644
I do.

11:04.614 --> 11:07.417
And you know, I'm, I'm just not
gonna stop doing what I can

11:07.417 --> 11:10.253
to show you what
it would be like

11:10.253 --> 11:12.355
to be in a normal,
healthy relationship.

11:12.355 --> 11:14.624
Whatever it takes.

11:14.624 --> 11:16.893
Dude, are you serious?

11:16.893 --> 11:19.496
Didn't your ex-wife off
herself...

11:19.496 --> 11:20.897
Zac.

11:20.897 --> 11:22.399
[Zac] ...in her salon,
in front of her?

11:22.399 --> 11:24.034
You know, brother, I'm talking
to Karen, not you.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.902
-And I'm talking to you, --.
-Yo, watch it.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.370
[Lisa] Boys, stop it.

11:27.370 --> 11:29.372
Watch it. He tough now.

11:29.372 --> 11:31.141
[Lisa] Zac, stop it.

11:31.141 --> 11:33.676
Yo, can I go?

11:33.676 --> 11:35.979
-Sure, yeah.
-Thank you.

11:35.979 --> 11:37.914
I, um, I actually have something
I want to say.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.482
-[Zac]<i> No, Fatima, let's go.
-</i> [Fatima]<i> Can I talk?</i>

11:39.482 --> 11:40.850
-Oh, God.
-[Fatima]<i> No.</i>

11:40.850 --> 11:43.053
Zac, I need to say this.

11:45.188 --> 11:47.090
Go ahead, Fatima.

11:47.090 --> 11:50.126
Thank you.

11:50.126 --> 11:54.798
Um, Karen, you and I have
already had this discussion.

11:56.900 --> 12:00.904
If this is Zac's baby, I will
never harm your child.

12:00.904 --> 12:03.073
That's number one.

12:03.073 --> 12:07.477
Number two, I know how you feel
about Zac.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.980
And I know you still love him.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.549
But you two are over.

12:12.549 --> 12:15.118
Facts.

12:15.118 --> 12:18.788
I just need to be sure that you
understand that.

12:18.788 --> 12:21.224
-Do you understand that?
-Yeah, I said that.

12:21.224 --> 12:24.761
Okay, so, all this
popping up at the house

12:24.761 --> 12:28.164
and waiting for him
has gotta stop.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.833
Wait a second.
Are you doing that, too?

12:29.833 --> 12:35.071
-Momma.
-Yes, she is.

12:35.071 --> 12:38.575
And I also want to talk about
the word bitch.

12:38.575 --> 12:39.843
Okay, now wait a second.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.044
Where is this going?

12:41.044 --> 12:43.780
No, just, Ms. Lisa?

12:43.780 --> 12:47.117
-[Lisa] Mm-hmm.
-Please just hear me out.

12:47.117 --> 12:50.920
As black people, when we say
you my --,

12:50.920 --> 12:52.288
that's how some of us speak.

12:52.288 --> 12:55.391
It's our culture.

12:55.391 --> 12:59.562
But when a white person says it,
we ready to go to war.

12:59.562 --> 13:02.899
Look, I call my friends bitch,
they call me bitch.

13:02.899 --> 13:05.101
But when someone
who's not my friend

13:05.101 --> 13:07.604
or in my circle
calls me a bitch,

13:07.604 --> 13:12.242
that's a call to war.

13:12.242 --> 13:14.377
So, I'll make this very clear,
Karen.

13:19.315 --> 13:22.418
-I've been very respectful.
-Mm-hmm.

13:22.418 --> 13:24.821
And I haven't called you out of
your name.

13:24.821 --> 13:28.958
Unless you called me out of mine
first.

13:28.958 --> 13:31.761
But that expiration date has
passed.

13:31.761 --> 13:34.364
As has your presence
in my house.

13:34.364 --> 13:36.699
-[Lisa] But wait a second.
-Get out now!

13:36.699 --> 13:38.001
-[Lisa] Wait a second.
-Gladly.

13:38.001 --> 13:39.302
-Is what she's saying is true?
-Momma.

13:39.302 --> 13:41.137
-[Zac] Yep.
-Yeah, I said that.

13:41.137 --> 13:43.006
Well, that's wrong.
That's just wrong.

13:43.006 --> 13:44.974
Momma, who's side are you on?

13:44.974 --> 13:46.409
I'm on the side of right, Karen.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.311
You know that's
always been my motto.

13:48.311 --> 13:50.947
But if you've been doing this,
you need to apologize.

13:50.947 --> 13:52.682
Alright, you know what?

13:52.682 --> 13:54.083
I'm not doing this.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.586
I'm not even supposed to be
stressed right now.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.720
Okay, I'm not doing this.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.155
I'm just not gonna do it.

13:59.155 --> 14:00.790
There's a lot of stuff
you don't know, Momma. Okay?

14:00.790 --> 14:02.425
-[laughing] She's stressed.
-[Lisa] Alright.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.460
Congrats, bro.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.762
Chill.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.631
I'm not. Honestly, y'all need to
get out my damn house.

14:08.631 --> 14:10.133
Get out!

14:12.569 --> 14:14.237
Get out!

14:17.674 --> 14:19.409
Who's idea was this?

14:19.409 --> 14:21.578
It's mine,
and I still stand by it

14:21.578 --> 14:23.179
because I know my daughter.

14:23.179 --> 14:26.482
Well, you can stand by her
and him by yourself.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.885
-Can we go?
-Sure.

14:28.885 --> 14:30.954
-Thanks come on, baby.
-Just one more thing.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.455
Come on, Fatima.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.524
Seriously, Zac.

14:34.524 --> 14:37.327
Look, Ms. Lisa, maybe, maybe you
can talk her into this

14:37.327 --> 14:39.963
so we don't have to wait nine
months to find out.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.065
What's that?

14:42.065 --> 14:45.068
If she can count back eleven
days from her period,

14:45.068 --> 14:48.238
that usually tells her fertility
cycle.

14:48.238 --> 14:53.843
Add ten days and that should
tell us when this happened.

14:53.843 --> 14:56.512
And if that's too confusing,
then maybe,

14:56.512 --> 14:58.214
she can get an ultrasound.

14:58.214 --> 15:01.017
And that usually tells the week
of conception.

15:01.017 --> 15:03.786
Hmm, well, she's already had the
ultrasound.

15:03.786 --> 15:05.321
Oh.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.391
Well, do we know close the
timing was?

15:11.194 --> 15:12.562
Are we really doing this shit
right now?

15:12.562 --> 15:14.464
Yes. I need dates.

15:14.464 --> 15:15.832
I don't got dates.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.233
I don't know.

15:18.468 --> 15:20.603
Aaron?

15:20.603 --> 15:22.805
It was in the same week.

15:22.805 --> 15:24.641
Cool, 'cause he always
following me.

15:24.641 --> 15:26.342
Well, there goes that theory.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.678
-The -- and everything.
-Zac.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.946
I'm just saying the facts, bro.

15:29.946 --> 15:31.514
It was worth a try.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.082
Okay.

15:33.082 --> 15:35.318
Ms. Lisa, it was really nice
meeting you.

15:35.318 --> 15:37.253
It was nice meeting you too.

15:37.253 --> 15:39.122
-And um...
-[mumbling]

15:41.591 --> 15:44.360
Karen's really lucky to have a
mother like you.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.828
Thank you.

15:45.828 --> 15:50.366
And for what it's worth, I, I
really hope all this worked.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.903
It did, I know my daughter.

15:53.903 --> 15:55.638
Okay.

15:55.638 --> 15:57.607
Bye, Zac.

15:58.741 --> 16:00.009
Take care, Fatima.

16:00.009 --> 16:02.011
Yo, don't do that.

16:02.011 --> 16:03.813
-Don't do that.
-Bye, Zac.

16:03.813 --> 16:05.682
Don't do that.

16:08.648 --> 16:10.850
Bruh, I'm telling you, Fatima
was so pressed for me, like,

16:10.850 --> 16:12.719
I had to tell her to chill out a
little bit.

16:12.719 --> 16:13.987
Like, for real.

16:13.987 --> 16:16.790
Um, why am I having a hard time
believing this?

16:16.790 --> 16:19.225
Honestly, like, she was pressed
for your boy.

16:19.225 --> 16:21.694
It was kind of crazy.

16:21.694 --> 16:25.398
Fatima, you know, seems here and
you.

16:25.398 --> 16:26.833
You gonna do me like that?

16:26.833 --> 16:28.434
For real?

16:28.434 --> 16:30.970
Okay, look, look, look, let me
tell you one more thing.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.972
What is it?

16:32.972 --> 16:34.774
I'm working your nerves?

16:34.774 --> 16:36.276
Go on.

16:36.276 --> 16:38.144
Okay, so, this dude Robin.

16:38.144 --> 16:41.014
He's leveraged to his eyeballs.

16:41.014 --> 16:42.148
How do you know?

16:42.148 --> 16:44.617
My contact over at Benson.

16:44.617 --> 16:48.988
See, they said, he out here
frontin' like he big shit.

16:48.988 --> 16:50.757
-Well, that's good to know.
-Yeah, I know.

16:50.757 --> 16:52.725
We got took over.

16:52.725 --> 16:54.394
Alright, let me warn you though,
Hayden.

16:54.394 --> 16:56.162
Don't underestimate him.

16:56.162 --> 16:57.630
I won't.

16:57.630 --> 17:00.200
I'm telling you, I was looking
at his resume.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.135
Hate to admit it,
but the guy's smart.

17:02.135 --> 17:04.370
Gary, we smart too.

17:05.238 --> 17:07.207
Well, I know I am.

17:07.207 --> 17:08.808
You really saying that to a
lawyer?

17:08.808 --> 17:10.877
-You gonna do me like that?
-Relax, I'm joking.

17:10.877 --> 17:12.345
Yeah, okay.

17:12.345 --> 17:14.314
I don't know, sometimes you're
judgement, Gary,

17:14.314 --> 17:16.015
I don't know.

17:16.015 --> 17:17.283
What do you mean?

17:17.283 --> 17:19.419
I mean Andi.

17:19.419 --> 17:20.954
What about her?

17:20.954 --> 17:25.491
You don't think it's strange
that we threaten to sue her

17:25.491 --> 17:28.328
and now, y'all all lovey-dovey
again, huh?

17:28.328 --> 17:30.230
Man, come on, with that shit,
man.

17:30.230 --> 17:32.365
I'm telling you,
she scared, bro.

17:32.365 --> 17:34.567
She wanted to see me.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.669
You really believe that?

17:36.669 --> 17:39.172
Okay, I'm telling you
when I was there,

17:39.172 --> 17:40.640
she didn't want me to leave.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.910
Alright, so, uh, shit,
give her a call.

17:43.910 --> 17:45.078
I'm not calling her.

17:45.078 --> 17:46.512
Oh, so you not gonna call her?

17:46.512 --> 17:48.214
See, 'cause I thought y'all used
to hit each other up,

17:48.214 --> 17:49.515
late at night, get it poppin'.

17:49.515 --> 17:51.351
What's the problem?

17:51.351 --> 17:52.819
We did.

17:52.819 --> 17:56.956
Oh, you worried she with Robin,
huh?

17:56.956 --> 17:59.626
'Cause he is in town.

17:59.626 --> 18:01.194
She's not with him.

18:01.194 --> 18:02.528
-No?
-No.

18:02.528 --> 18:04.697
How you know that?

18:04.697 --> 18:07.867
Because she's at home waiting
for me to call her.

18:07.867 --> 18:10.470
Pretty confident.

18:10.470 --> 18:13.673
You wanna bet on it?

18:13.673 --> 18:18.378
If I call her, and she says yes,

18:18.378 --> 18:20.246
what do I get?

18:20.246 --> 18:22.482
You can name your price.

18:22.482 --> 18:26.686
But, if she does say no,

18:26.686 --> 18:29.088
I'm thinking you gotta throw me
like, 10 additional shares

18:29.088 --> 18:30.423
when we take over.

18:30.423 --> 18:31.724
I'm not doing that.

18:31.724 --> 18:34.394
Oh, so you ain't confident,
then?

18:34.394 --> 18:37.230
I'll tell you what.

18:37.230 --> 18:42.268
When I call her and she will
say yes, you give me 30 shares.

18:42.268 --> 18:43.636
-Hell no.
-Exactly.

18:43.636 --> 18:44.771
-I ain't taking that deal.
-Dumb ass bet.

18:44.771 --> 18:46.306
That's a terrible deal.

18:46.306 --> 18:47.874
Okay, okay, okay, look.

18:47.874 --> 18:49.008
How about this?

18:49.008 --> 18:52.612
How about we do three shares
either way?

18:54.447 --> 18:55.982
I'll take that bet.

18:55.982 --> 18:57.617
Yeah, we got a bet!

18:57.617 --> 18:59.419
-Okay, fine.
-Call her.

19:00.520 --> 19:02.855
[sighs]

19:02.855 --> 19:04.324
I'm waiting.

19:04.324 --> 19:06.092
Hayden.

19:07.093 --> 19:09.562
[phone vibrating]

19:11.064 --> 19:12.865
Hello.

19:12.865 --> 19:14.133
Are you up?

19:14.133 --> 19:15.601
Yep, I'm working.

19:15.601 --> 19:17.036
[Gary]<i> Okay, that's good.</i>

19:17.036 --> 19:19.005
Hey look, I wanted to, uh,
I wanted to see you.

19:19.005 --> 19:20.740
You just saw me, Gary.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.544
I know, but gosh, I want to see
again and again and again.

19:24.544 --> 19:26.045
Come on, come on.

19:26.045 --> 19:27.347
Don't say no.

19:27.347 --> 19:29.549
I have to be up early tomorrow.

19:29.549 --> 19:31.050
I can't be up all night.

19:31.050 --> 19:34.220
Look, okay, okay,
just for a few hours.

19:34.220 --> 19:36.155
A few hours is all night.

19:36.155 --> 19:39.892
Come on, the longer you delay,
the longer...

19:39.892 --> 19:42.261
Okay, come on.

19:42.261 --> 19:43.563
But hurry up.

19:43.563 --> 19:45.898
-Do you need anything?
-Just you.

19:45.898 --> 19:47.533
Well, I already got all that.

19:47.533 --> 19:48.868
Hurry up.

19:48.868 --> 19:50.203
Alright,
I'll talk to you in a bit.

19:50.203 --> 19:52.105
[Andi]<i> Bye.</i>

19:52.105 --> 19:55.074
Hayden, uh,
did you bring your wallet?

19:55.074 --> 19:56.642
'Cause I guess I'll be seeing
you later.

19:56.642 --> 19:58.077
Why you lying, bruh?

19:58.077 --> 19:59.212
Why you lying?

19:59.212 --> 20:02.482
I told you, I got it.

20:02.482 --> 20:04.117
She playing you, bruh.

20:04.117 --> 20:05.418
She's not playing me.

20:05.418 --> 20:08.054
I'm telling you,
she playing you.

20:08.054 --> 20:12.892
Well, I guess I'll be
the one playing tonight.

20:12.892 --> 20:15.294
Yeah, okay.

20:15.294 --> 20:17.630
My man, he got it.

20:17.630 --> 20:19.565
Oh, it's like that, huh?

20:19.565 --> 20:21.200
Have fun.

20:31.043 --> 20:33.045
What the --?

20:33.045 --> 20:35.414
Uh-uh, no, everybody,
you gotta leave.

20:35.414 --> 20:37.016
Give me this.
What's wrong with you?

20:37.016 --> 20:38.484
Out. Out.

20:38.484 --> 20:40.052
What the -- are you doing?

20:40.052 --> 20:41.720
Give me this thing.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.822
Back up. Get out.

20:43.822 --> 20:45.891
Out. Out.

20:47.293 --> 20:48.527
Did I stutter?

20:48.527 --> 20:50.596
Get the -- out.

20:53.265 --> 20:55.334
Hey.

20:55.334 --> 20:56.735
That's my room bitches.

20:56.735 --> 20:58.037
Get the -- out.

20:58.037 --> 21:00.272
That way.

21:09.882 --> 21:11.717
I don't believe this shit.

21:15.754 --> 21:19.625
Excuse me Miss, but you gotta
get the -- out.

21:19.625 --> 21:22.494
Not that, get yo ass
out of there.

21:22.494 --> 21:24.630
That way.

21:24.630 --> 21:27.299
That's the bathroom.

21:30.536 --> 21:33.872
Dizzy bitches.

21:33.872 --> 21:36.342
You gotta be -- kidding me.

21:36.342 --> 21:38.143
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:38.143 --> 21:39.678
-Those were my guests.
-I don't give a --.

21:39.678 --> 21:42.681
What the -- is wrong with you?

21:44.483 --> 21:47.486
You gotta go. You gotta go.

21:47.486 --> 21:48.854
I don't give a --
where you go.

21:48.854 --> 21:50.522
But you gotta get
the -- out of here.

21:50.522 --> 21:52.524
I'm not going anywhere.

21:52.524 --> 21:54.760

for one second

21:54.760 --> 21:56.495

21:56.495 --> 21:59.999

21:59.999 --> 22:03.802
That's your job.

22:03.802 --> 22:05.404
You the bitch around here.

22:05.404 --> 22:10.843
Que, I'm trying not to break my
foot off in your ass.

22:10.843 --> 22:15.014

22:15.014 --> 22:18.717
I can't, I can't
believe this --.

22:19.985 --> 22:22.388
Where the hell is all the food?

22:22.388 --> 22:24.189
We ate it.

22:33.732 --> 22:35.634
Where the -- is the TV?

22:37.903 --> 22:40.272
I smoked the TV, momma.

22:40.272 --> 22:42.441
[laughing]

22:42.441 --> 22:44.276
You think this shit's funny?

22:45.277 --> 22:47.212
Be-beyond.

22:49.782 --> 22:51.850
Wait 'till I start
hitting your room.

22:51.850 --> 22:53.452
--, I dare you.

22:53.452 --> 22:55.287
I already have.

22:55.287 --> 22:56.855
[laughing]

23:00.125 --> 23:01.927
My door.

23:01.927 --> 23:06.065
I told you ain't no such thing
as locks to a gangsta.

23:06.065 --> 23:07.800
Gangsta.

23:12.104 --> 23:14.039
You doing drugs?

23:14.039 --> 23:15.374
Yep.

23:15.374 --> 23:18.577
With an ankle monitor on?

23:18.577 --> 23:20.345
You looking at it.

23:20.345 --> 23:22.648
You know if the cops catch you,
you're going back, right?

23:22.648 --> 23:24.283
Yeah.

23:24.283 --> 23:25.551
Alright, -- it.

23:25.551 --> 23:27.720
You don't care, I'm calling 'em.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.321
You don't know who to call.

23:29.321 --> 23:30.856
I'll find out.

23:30.856 --> 23:32.558
You let me have to deal
with somebody's shit

23:32.558 --> 23:34.259
'cause you called them.

23:34.259 --> 23:37.229
You think somebody's really
scared of you, don't you?

23:37.229 --> 23:41.033
I can look at you
and see that you --.

23:41.033 --> 23:44.002
You know,
that shit's getting really old.

23:44.002 --> 23:48.173
Yes it is, so, uh, clean it up.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.318
--.

24:04.123 --> 24:06.725
Where the --
are my golf clubs?

24:06.725 --> 24:08.794
I smoked the golf clubs, momma.

24:08.794 --> 24:10.262
[laughing]

24:10.262 --> 24:11.697
Que.

24:11.697 --> 24:13.932
I, I, I left you one.

24:13.932 --> 24:15.534
This is some bullshit.

24:15.534 --> 24:18.270
Well, call the police.

24:18.270 --> 24:19.571
I did.

24:19.571 --> 24:21.840
They tell you
how this shit works?

24:21.840 --> 24:25.711
Your name isn't on the lease
so you can't put me out.

24:25.711 --> 24:27.946
[laughing]

24:28.680 --> 24:30.315
Que.

24:32.751 --> 24:36.088
I got about 75 dollars for 'em.

24:36.088 --> 24:38.624
Those golf clubs
were worth a grand.

24:38.624 --> 24:40.692
And they were my dead father's.

24:40.692 --> 24:42.427
I told you, I left you one.

24:42.427 --> 24:44.329
You got one.

24:49.635 --> 24:51.737
--!

24:51.737 --> 24:53.372
Why are you so upset?

24:53.372 --> 24:55.207
You blowing my high.

24:59.311 --> 25:00.846
Oh.

25:09.721 --> 25:11.390
You been quiet.

25:12.724 --> 25:14.359
No.

25:15.694 --> 25:19.731
I mean, ever since we got home,
you ain't say nothing.

25:19.731 --> 25:21.867
I'm just, I'm just thinking.

25:23.802 --> 25:26.138
You want me to
drag it out of you?

25:27.172 --> 25:29.474
I'm just thinking, Zac,
that's all.

25:30.609 --> 25:33.378
Why'd you even come?

25:33.378 --> 25:35.414
I was invited wasn't I?

25:35.414 --> 25:38.884
Yeah, you were, but you told me
you wasn't coming, so.

25:38.884 --> 25:40.853
I was talked into it.

25:40.853 --> 25:44.089
You little gangsta cousin?

25:44.089 --> 25:46.992
She just pointed some things out
to me.

25:46.992 --> 25:49.161
I see, like what?

25:49.161 --> 25:52.564
Like, I need to get
all the information.

25:52.564 --> 25:53.966
Y'all just be talking in code.

25:53.966 --> 25:56.001
Like, what does that even mean.

25:56.001 --> 25:59.605
Zac, not just your side of the
story but hers too.

25:59.605 --> 26:01.373
Mmm.

26:02.107 --> 26:04.676
So, you believe her?

26:04.676 --> 26:07.379
-Who Karen?
-Yeah.

26:07.379 --> 26:12.117
Yeah, I believe her.

26:12.117 --> 26:14.219
So, now you think I ain't shit,
too, right?

26:15.287 --> 26:19.625
No, Zac, I know you're the shit,
okay?

26:19.625 --> 26:21.159
What?

26:21.159 --> 26:23.161
Look, God does not waste my time
on losers.

26:23.161 --> 26:25.130
I been there and done that.

26:25.130 --> 26:26.565
And I prayed
it never happens again.

26:26.565 --> 26:29.968
So, yes, I know you are.

26:29.968 --> 26:31.536
So, what do you believe?

26:31.536 --> 26:34.039
Like, I'm confused.

26:34.039 --> 26:38.010
I believe that you were
challenging.

26:38.010 --> 26:40.345
I believe that you cheated.

26:40.345 --> 26:41.947
And that she paid for
everything.

26:41.947 --> 26:43.415
Alright, wait, wait.

26:43.415 --> 26:46.618
I paid her all her money back,
plus some.

26:46.618 --> 26:48.053
Zac, I know that.

26:48.053 --> 26:49.621
Okay, so she need to chill with
that narrative

26:49.621 --> 26:51.223
or I can get my money back.

26:51.223 --> 26:52.991
She was not giving you all that
money and helping you

26:52.991 --> 26:54.760
to get the money back.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.662
That is the dumbest, what?

26:56.662 --> 26:58.730
That don't even make no sense.

26:58.730 --> 27:02.334
Karen was investing in you on a
much larger return.

27:02.334 --> 27:06.238
The one that I'm getting
right now.

27:06.238 --> 27:08.440
So, I'm an investment then,
like?

27:08.440 --> 27:10.976
Babe, relationships are
investments.

27:10.976 --> 27:13.912
Like, I'm invested in you,
you're invested in me.

27:13.912 --> 27:17.382
We hope we can get everything we
can out of it.

27:17.382 --> 27:19.751
Money.

27:19.751 --> 27:21.853
Sometimes, yeah.

27:21.853 --> 27:24.523
Is that what you looking for?
Money?

27:24.523 --> 27:29.294
Zac, I could be on a yacht right
now with a billionaire.

27:29.294 --> 27:30.796
But I'm right here with you.

27:30.796 --> 27:33.098
Who's this billionaire that you
can be on a yacht with?

27:33.098 --> 27:34.800
You see, that's,
that's not the point.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.403
So, then what's the point?

27:38.403 --> 27:41.373
Okay, take Chain Breakers,
for instance.

27:41.373 --> 27:43.008
Okay.

27:43.008 --> 27:44.810
Say you put all the money in
that you put in

27:44.810 --> 27:46.678
and then you lost it.

27:46.678 --> 27:47.913
Mm-hmm, that happened.

27:47.913 --> 27:49.348
Okay.

27:49.348 --> 27:51.883
Then someone comes in a couple
weeks later

27:51.883 --> 27:55.520
and gets everything you wanted
and some.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.888
-Okay.
-Alright?

27:56.888 --> 27:59.124
It's like sitting a slot machine
for years,

27:59.124 --> 28:01.093
putting money into it,
putting money into it

28:01.093 --> 28:03.061
and never getting anything back,

28:03.061 --> 28:05.197
and then the day you get up,
someone comes

28:05.197 --> 28:08.834
and sits in that seat
and gets all the money.

28:08.834 --> 28:11.536
And Zac, I get her.

28:11.536 --> 28:13.772
And I understand her.

28:13.772 --> 28:17.109
I just, I just hope she heard
me.

28:17.109 --> 28:18.677
Yeah, I do too.

28:18.677 --> 28:20.512
I'm about tired of this shit.

28:21.813 --> 28:23.015
Okay, I'm about to go to sleep.

28:23.015 --> 28:24.216
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:24.216 --> 28:25.751
No, no, no, no, no.

28:25.751 --> 28:28.086
-What?
-I got one more question.

28:28.086 --> 28:30.389
Ugh, what is it?

28:30.389 --> 28:33.291
How do you know all that
other stuff?

28:33.291 --> 28:37.562
The talk backwards from ten days
with eleven,

28:37.562 --> 28:39.931
pythagorium theorem, shit,
with the pregnancy.

28:39.931 --> 28:41.433
Like, how you know that?

28:41.433 --> 28:43.168
Ah, shit.

28:43.168 --> 28:44.669
[clears throat]

28:44.669 --> 28:45.971
[Zac clears throat]

28:45.971 --> 28:47.272
Research, Baby, just research.

28:47.272 --> 28:49.041
Yeah, what's you researching,
like?

28:49.041 --> 28:50.308
I'm going to bed.

28:50.308 --> 28:51.843
No, no, no, don't do that.

28:51.843 --> 28:54.012
What you researching?

28:54.012 --> 28:56.948
Zac, if I didn't know
how to count,

28:56.948 --> 28:59.918
I'd be pregnant by yo ass
so many times.

28:59.918 --> 29:01.186
Shit, yeah.

29:01.186 --> 29:02.320
-[Fatima] Yeah.
-That's true.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.490
-So, I know how to do that.
-Alright.

29:05.490 --> 29:07.826
Do you think that can tell us
who the father is?

29:07.826 --> 29:10.462
It's gonna be hard with y'all
taking turns in the same week.

29:10.462 --> 29:11.730
There you go.

29:11.730 --> 29:12.998
You always gotta bring that up.

29:12.998 --> 29:14.132
I wasn't taking turns,
he be following me.

29:14.132 --> 29:15.734
You wanna talk about that?

29:15.734 --> 29:17.369
[yawning] I need sleep.

29:17.369 --> 29:18.503
Um, yeah.

29:18.503 --> 29:20.238
It be catching me like late,
'cause sometimes

29:20.238 --> 29:21.807
certain things trigger it
and I get tired.

29:21.807 --> 29:23.508
Mm-hmm, goodnight.

29:23.508 --> 29:25.777
You know you not going to bed
with all that makeup on.

29:25.777 --> 29:28.213
I know why you got it on.
Come on.

29:28.213 --> 29:29.581
-What makeup? Shut up.
-Nah, don't do that.

29:29.581 --> 29:30.982
I woke up like this.

29:30.982 --> 29:32.684
That's all, yeah, you about to
go to sleep somewhere else.

29:35.571 --> 29:38.574
-Hey.
-Hey.

29:38.574 --> 29:40.476
How are you?

29:40.476 --> 29:43.112
I'm okay.

29:45.715 --> 29:47.383
How do you feel?

29:47.383 --> 29:50.753
[sighs]

29:50.753 --> 29:53.556
I'm gutted, Momma.

29:53.556 --> 29:54.924
I know you don't want to hear
this,

29:54.924 --> 29:57.960
but, this is how it starts.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.128
How what starts, Momma?

29:59.128 --> 30:01.330
You keep saying that.

30:02.732 --> 30:05.000
Healing.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.436
Getting it all out of you.

30:07.436 --> 30:08.437
It opens you up.

30:08.437 --> 30:10.373
So, the bad things can leave

30:10.373 --> 30:13.509
and you make plenty of space for
the good things.

30:15.511 --> 30:18.647
You really think this was the
right thing to do?

30:18.647 --> 30:22.952
Oh, [chuckles] absolutely, it
was the right thing to do.

30:22.952 --> 30:27.189
I know every emotion
that you're feeling.

30:27.189 --> 30:28.758
You know how I'm feeling?

30:30.159 --> 30:33.262
Baby, I've felt gutted before.

30:33.262 --> 30:35.664
I have felt vulnerable.

30:35.664 --> 30:37.400
I've been scared.

30:37.400 --> 30:43.339
But then, all that space was
open.

30:43.339 --> 30:45.941
So, I could plant some good
things.

30:45.941 --> 30:49.478
It was all good ground.

30:49.478 --> 30:51.947
So, you know what I planted?

30:51.947 --> 30:54.483
I planted love.

30:54.483 --> 30:57.019
Joy.

30:57.019 --> 30:59.054
Laughter.

30:59.054 --> 31:01.424
And I put it all right there.

31:01.424 --> 31:03.492
You make it sound easy.

31:03.492 --> 31:08.597
[laughs] No, trust me,
it's not easy.

31:10.032 --> 31:11.734
But it is right.

31:13.002 --> 31:15.137
I just didn't like seeing her.

31:15.871 --> 31:17.773
I know.

31:17.773 --> 31:20.476
-But you know what?
-Don't say it, Momma.

31:21.944 --> 31:23.679
You were right about her.

31:23.679 --> 31:25.147
She seems really cool.

31:25.147 --> 31:28.651
I know, I know.

31:28.651 --> 31:30.753
It makes me want to hate her
even more.

31:30.753 --> 31:32.087
[laughing]

31:32.087 --> 31:34.089
I wish she was a bitch.

31:34.089 --> 31:38.260
And about that bitch thing, you
know, she was right about that.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.163
Okay, Momma, I know, it was a
misunderstanding, okay?

31:41.163 --> 31:43.799
I know what Imma focus on now.

31:43.799 --> 31:45.167
Again.

31:45.167 --> 31:46.635
Christmas.

31:46.635 --> 31:49.839
Thank you.

31:49.839 --> 31:52.842
Could you sleep with me tonight?

31:52.842 --> 31:54.510
Sure.

31:54.510 --> 31:55.811
Thank you.

31:55.811 --> 31:57.413
[laughing]

31:57.413 --> 31:59.849
Oh, Momma's getting stiff.

31:59.849 --> 32:01.550
[laughing]

32:02.852 --> 32:04.220
Okay.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.455
Alright, you know what?

32:06.455 --> 32:08.090
I want to tell you something.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.459
What's that, Momma?

32:10.459 --> 32:15.264
About the accountant, he really
loves you.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.870
-I know.
-Yeah.

32:20.870 --> 32:25.541
But...[sighs]

32:25.541 --> 32:28.377
But what?

32:28.377 --> 32:34.250
-Seems to be too good...
-To be true?

32:35.017 --> 32:37.119
So you feel that too?

32:37.119 --> 32:38.454
Yeah.

32:38.454 --> 32:40.623
I wanna know what he's hiding.

32:42.124 --> 32:47.796
Sometimes I think that, but then
I think I'm just being paranoid.

32:47.796 --> 32:50.232
Maybe.

32:50.232 --> 32:52.701
Maybe, why you were holding on
to Zac,

32:52.701 --> 32:57.406
isn't so much about Zac as much
as it's about this.

32:58.908 --> 33:00.175
You think?

33:00.175 --> 33:01.777
It's possible.

33:01.777 --> 33:04.480
But you know what else?

33:04.480 --> 33:06.549
You're gonna be okay.

33:08.250 --> 33:09.785
Yeah.

33:09.785 --> 33:12.488
Bedrest and all.

33:12.488 --> 33:13.923
Can we talk about that?

33:13.923 --> 33:15.424
Oh my God, really?

33:15.424 --> 33:16.926
Come on, Momma.

33:16.926 --> 33:19.595
I just, can I go to the salon
for like you know?

33:19.595 --> 33:22.331
You're supposed to stay in bed.

33:22.331 --> 33:24.400
The doctor's orders.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.834
You gonna watch me all day?

33:25.834 --> 33:27.403
All day.

33:27.403 --> 33:30.706
You are so not getting out of
this bed tomorrow.

33:30.706 --> 33:32.408
Fine.

33:34.143 --> 33:35.511
I don't know.

33:35.511 --> 33:38.013
As soon as the doctor says
you're clear.

33:38.013 --> 33:40.549
-Fine.
-Okay.

33:40.549 --> 33:42.551
But if you're really good
tonight,

33:42.551 --> 33:46.922
I'll let you go in tomorrow for
30 minutes.

33:49.058 --> 33:50.693
Momma, I'm grown.

33:50.693 --> 33:52.094
[laughing]

33:52.094 --> 33:54.296
You're so not grown.

33:57.166 --> 33:59.602
[music]

34:01.870 --> 34:03.172
Make you scream girl.

34:03.172 --> 34:05.307
I'm gonna make you scream.

34:05.307 --> 34:08.344
Agh, agh, agh.

34:08.344 --> 34:09.945
Yeah, scream baby.

34:09.945 --> 34:11.380
My phone's ringing.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.948
It's ringing. I gotta get it.

34:12.948 --> 34:14.149
Oh, I didn't hear anything.

34:14.149 --> 34:15.351
No, I, I heard it.

34:15.351 --> 34:16.819
I gotta go.

34:16.819 --> 34:18.053
It's important.

34:18.053 --> 34:19.855
It's an important phone call.

34:19.855 --> 34:21.290
Yep, okay.

34:21.290 --> 34:24.326
Well, I'll be right back.

34:24.326 --> 34:26.195
-Okay?
-Alright, okay.

34:26.195 --> 34:27.563
Come on.

34:27.563 --> 34:29.999
Yeah, I know it. I know.

34:36.438 --> 34:39.141
[phone vibrating]

34:39.141 --> 34:40.275
-Hey girl.
-[Danni]<i> Hey.</i>

34:40.275 --> 34:41.610
You still busy?

34:41.610 --> 34:42.745
Girl, no.

34:42.745 --> 34:44.246
You never gave me
what the time was.

34:44.246 --> 34:46.448
Oh, I will give it to you
in the morning.

34:46.448 --> 34:49.618
Alright, well, what you doing?

34:49.618 --> 34:50.886
Nothing.

34:50.886 --> 34:52.321
Didn't you have company?

34:52.321 --> 34:55.157
Girl, worst mistake of my life.

34:55.157 --> 34:56.625
Well, who was it?

34:56.625 --> 34:59.128
Somebody I met at the airport.

34:59.128 --> 35:00.462
Danni.

35:00.462 --> 35:03.165
I just wanted to have
a hot girl summer.

35:03.165 --> 35:05.067
Call Preston, okay?

35:05.067 --> 35:06.735
What?

35:06.735 --> 35:09.004
You are, obviously, affected by
the whole situation.

35:09.004 --> 35:10.305
So, just call him.

35:10.305 --> 35:11.740
I'm not.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.475
[Andi]<i> Well, picking up
all these strays</i>

35:13.475 --> 35:15.444
is not gonna help you
deal with this.

35:15.444 --> 35:17.279
Especially, not this one.

35:17.279 --> 35:18.714
What happened?

35:18.714 --> 35:22.117
Girl, if there was a prize

35:22.117 --> 35:25.788
for the world's smallest --.

35:25.788 --> 35:27.423
Uh-uh.

35:27.423 --> 35:30.592
[Danni]<i> First place, I'm just
saying.</i>

35:30.592 --> 35:32.194
[Andi]<i> Where is he?</i>

35:32.194 --> 35:33.629
In my bed.

35:33.629 --> 35:35.030
Get him out of there.

35:35.030 --> 35:36.198
[Danni]<i> I want to.</i>

35:36.198 --> 35:37.633
Well, then, just do it.

35:37.633 --> 35:38.967
Well.

35:38.967 --> 35:43.305
Wait, wait,
are you scared to be alone?

35:43.305 --> 35:45.708
I don't know what's going on
with me.

35:45.708 --> 35:48.577
Just call Preston, girl, if you
want to be with somebody.

35:48.577 --> 35:49.978
And say what, you know,

35:49.978 --> 35:51.447
I don't, I don't want you
to get married?

35:51.447 --> 35:52.881
I'm not gonna do that.

35:52.881 --> 35:55.217
Well, you could be missing out
on the love of your life.

35:55.217 --> 35:58.487
I'm getting advice from the
woman who is with Gary.

35:58.487 --> 36:00.989
Yes, and he's coming over.

36:00.989 --> 36:03.892
Yeah, I'm gonna have to call
somebody else.

36:03.892 --> 36:07.029
<i>I'm just saying if you're gonna
have a hot girl summer,</i>

36:07.029 --> 36:08.797
you should have some rules.

36:08.797 --> 36:12.034
Mm, I know, from Andi,
this is rich.

36:12.034 --> 36:14.269
Yeah, the first one is getting
that man out of your bed.

36:14.269 --> 36:16.038
I will.

36:16.038 --> 36:19.241
And you know it's like I just
been really missing...

36:19.241 --> 36:20.876
I gotta go, Gary's here.

36:20.876 --> 36:23.312
Wow, you just gonna
leave me in distress?

36:23.312 --> 36:24.813
Call Preston.

36:24.813 --> 36:26.882
-I'll see you in the morning.
-[Andi]<i> Yep.</i>

36:26.882 --> 36:28.617
Okay.

36:30.803 --> 36:33.306
-Hi.
-Hi.

36:33.306 --> 36:34.807
How are you?

36:36.375 --> 36:38.511
I'm good, how are you?

36:38.511 --> 36:41.113
Mm-hmm, you're drunk.

36:41.113 --> 36:43.950
No, just buzzed.

36:43.950 --> 36:46.586
Mm-hmm.

36:46.586 --> 36:49.689
Okay, well,
come here and kiss me.

36:51.691 --> 36:54.126
Gary, you're still horny.

36:54.126 --> 36:57.029
I told you I missed you.

36:57.029 --> 36:59.031
-Did you?
-Mm-hmm.

36:59.031 --> 37:00.633
How come you, um,

37:00.633 --> 37:04.437
you went from not wanting to be
intimate with me to...

37:04.437 --> 37:08.074
Look, don't mention that.

37:08.074 --> 37:09.809
What changed?

37:12.879 --> 37:14.847
It was stupid.

37:14.847 --> 37:18.017
It was dumb.

37:18.017 --> 37:19.886
And I just got over it.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.289
Did you?

37:23.289 --> 37:27.293
Yeah, so, come on.

37:27.293 --> 37:28.761
Wait, I can't.

37:28.761 --> 37:31.631
-I can't be up all night.
-I know.

37:31.631 --> 37:34.166
I have to get up early.
I have to help my friend.

37:34.166 --> 37:35.735
Yeah, I get it.

37:35.735 --> 37:37.303
You go take a shower.

37:37.303 --> 37:38.638
I'll be here.
I'll wait for you.

37:38.638 --> 37:40.573
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:40.573 --> 37:42.441
Go, go get clean.

37:42.441 --> 37:43.609
I love you.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.478
[laughing] I love you too.

37:55.721 --> 37:57.723
Just throw it anywhere.

38:10.169 --> 38:13.572
Are you really gonna try to pull
this shit?

38:13.572 --> 38:16.108
Oh, this is, this is bad.

38:20.179 --> 38:21.681
Come here, sexy.

38:21.681 --> 38:23.616
Did you just call me Suzie?

38:23.616 --> 38:25.351
No, I said sexy.

38:25.351 --> 38:26.919
Look at you girl, come here.

38:26.919 --> 38:28.321
Come here.

38:28.321 --> 38:29.622
Come get this.

38:29.622 --> 38:32.692
Come get this piece, baby.

38:32.692 --> 38:35.528
Come on, come on.

38:35.528 --> 38:36.796
Hold on, hold on.

38:36.796 --> 38:39.598
Hold, hold, hold, hold.

38:41.200 --> 38:42.802
Ugh.

38:44.470 --> 38:46.138
Okay, um.

38:47.940 --> 38:50.810
I'm trying to get it back in.

38:50.810 --> 38:53.479
Okay, okay, we tried.

38:53.479 --> 38:56.048
Oh. We tried.

38:56.048 --> 38:57.850
You know? Um.

38:59.418 --> 39:00.553
What happened?
What happened?

39:00.553 --> 39:03.723
No, I just, um, I just.

39:03.723 --> 39:05.024
What happened?

39:05.024 --> 39:06.892
What?

39:08.060 --> 39:09.695
[laughing]

39:09.695 --> 39:11.664
It's not what I wanted.

39:14.533 --> 39:17.536
Um, I can try it
a different way.

39:17.536 --> 39:20.406
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

39:20.406 --> 39:23.309
No, we, we tried different ways.

39:26.178 --> 39:29.181
Oh, okay, uh, shit.

39:32.685 --> 39:34.620
I'm sorry.

39:34.620 --> 39:36.288
You want me to go?

39:38.290 --> 39:39.725
Please.

39:39.725 --> 39:43.162
No, it's just, uh,
it's all good.

39:43.162 --> 39:45.264
It's not you, it's me.

39:45.264 --> 39:48.200
No, it's me.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.337
No, I mean, maybe.

39:51.337 --> 39:54.040
You bitches, I tell ya.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.441
Wait, what?

39:55.441 --> 39:58.177
Yeah, I knew it.

39:58.177 --> 40:00.413
So, I, I'm a bitch,
I'm a bitches?

40:00.413 --> 40:02.748
Yeah.

40:02.748 --> 40:04.183
Y'all all do the same shit.

40:04.183 --> 40:05.818
And what is that, hmm?

40:05.818 --> 40:08.454
You know, you know you got me
hot and bothered

40:08.454 --> 40:11.757
and then you just
tell me to stop.

40:14.627 --> 40:16.962
Can I at least tell you
what's going on?

40:21.367 --> 40:23.035
-- you.

40:26.005 --> 40:27.606
I tried.

40:27.606 --> 40:29.141
[growling] Don't do it, Danni.

40:29.141 --> 40:30.342
I'm gonna do it.

40:30.342 --> 40:32.845
You know what?

40:32.845 --> 40:34.580
That's the problem.

40:34.580 --> 40:36.515
-What?
-You can't -- me.

40:36.515 --> 40:38.984
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

40:40.319 --> 40:43.856
You know, you can get the --
out of my house.

40:46.192 --> 40:47.960
What the --?

40:47.960 --> 40:51.630
You know if you had at least
three inches, at least,

40:51.630 --> 40:53.566
maybe I would want you.

40:53.566 --> 40:55.968
You know, maybe, condoms would
stay on.

40:55.968 --> 40:57.336
But you know, I don't think you
need condoms.

40:57.336 --> 40:59.004
You could probably just use
kiddie balloons.

40:59.004 --> 41:03.109
You know those string ones to
make little balloon animals.

41:03.109 --> 41:05.244
Like, that -- shouldn't even
be called a --.

41:05.244 --> 41:06.946
It should be called like,
a clitoris.

41:06.946 --> 41:08.347
No, clitoris is too long.

41:08.347 --> 41:09.515
Just clit.

41:09.515 --> 41:11.650
Just C, maybe.

41:11.650 --> 41:13.385
You should lick it then, bitch.

41:14.453 --> 41:16.255
Get the -- out of my house.

41:17.456 --> 41:18.991
Get the -- out of my house.

41:28.243 --> 41:29.878
This is not happening.

41:29.878 --> 41:31.846
It's happening.

41:31.846 --> 41:33.648
The IP address was traced
back to you.

41:33.648 --> 41:35.583
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:35.583 --> 41:37.118
He found out that
I sent that email.

41:37.118 --> 41:38.887
How the hell did he do that?

41:38.887 --> 41:40.989
[Hayden]<i> I don't know, he said
got CIA connections.</i>

41:40.989 --> 41:43.758
Look, I need y'all to tell her

41:43.758 --> 41:45.393
that you gonna take a day with
me checking in.

41:45.393 --> 41:47.629
Hi, Ms. Lisa.

41:47.629 --> 41:50.265
I'll just call the doctor
later myself.

41:52.634 --> 41:53.835
Hey are you okay?

41:53.835 --> 41:55.703
Andi, I need a lawyer.

41:56.774 --> 42:00.745

42:26.532 --> 42:28.534
