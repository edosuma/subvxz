Did you get that stump
out of the ground today?

00:16.766 --> 00:19.033
I already told you.
Dary and I are
doing it Friday.

00:19.066 --> 00:20.666
You never told me that.
Did too.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.266
You gotta tell her
more than once.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.733

'Cause that might be a little
too punk rock, Dary.

for a demolition derby.

No you never.
Ain't no reason
to get excited.

You better settle down
over there

talk to you...

things I don't like about you,
and it's your face.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.600
There's one thing

about me?

better than a fart.

Wondrous.

10:41.366 --> 10:43.266
You talk to her, then.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.300
We reconvene back here
in 24 hours.

11:02.133 --> 11:03.366

(CAT FARTING)

11:14.066 --> 11:16.033
Hey, has Katy liked
any of your farts on Fartbook?

11:16.566 --> 11:17.666
No, you?

11:18.533 --> 11:20.000
Huh.
No. Huh.

11:22.133 --> 11:23.300
(BOTH PANTING)

11:26.466 --> 11:27.766
We got a problem.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.233
We need to talk to Gail.

11:31.266 --> 11:32.566
(GRUNTING) Gail.

11:35.666 --> 11:37.633
How are you now?

11:37.666 --> 11:41.166
Good and you?
Not so bad.

11:41.200 --> 11:45.333
Gail, we've summoned
you here today to talk
about your Fartbook profile.

11:45.366 --> 11:47.166
Okay.
Let's listen.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.000
(FART RECORDINGS PLAYING)

12:00.266 --> 12:02.500
Everything about that
so right.
Wrong.

12:02.533 --> 12:05.600
You've attached messages
to each of your farts.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.133
For example,

12:08.166 --> 12:11.466
send this fart to ten people
or you will have bad sex
for the rest of your life.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.133
But see, I had just got that
message from someone else.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.600
So it's like, if I didn't
send it, then I'd be stuck
having bad shaboink forever.

12:17.633 --> 12:22.100
And I enjoy a horizontal
refreshment for my
vertical smile

12:22.133 --> 12:24.300
too goddamn much
to take that risk.

12:24.333 --> 12:26.533
It's called spamming, Gail.

12:26.566 --> 12:30.266
Never heard it called that.
Heard it called spunking
one or two times...

12:30.300 --> 12:32.600
No. Sending annoying messages
to people

12:32.633 --> 12:35.133
who have not requested it
is called spamming.

12:35.166 --> 12:36.400
Okay.

12:36.433 --> 12:38.366
And it's annoying.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.500
No. No. No.
Yes. Yes.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.500
If you continue
to misuse Fartbook,

12:44.533 --> 12:45.733
we'll have
to suspend
your membership.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.700
Suspend my membership?

12:47.733 --> 12:50.300
Why don't you suspend
my fist in your ass,
you little fuck.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.533
If you ever threaten me
like that again,
I'll spread your cheeks

12:52.566 --> 12:55.500
and I'll feed you
a Kentucky Klondike Bar,
you little twat.

12:55.533 --> 12:58.433
I'll drop an Alabama Hot
Pocket in your
deuce maker, Charlie.

13:23.366 --> 13:25.200
What?
STEWART: Katy.

13:25.233 --> 13:28.000
We've summoned you here today
to talk about your
Fartbook profile.

Let's listen.

13:34.733 --> 13:35.533
(FART RECORDINGS PLAYING)

13:45.766 --> 13:48.633
Problem?
Those are cat farts.

13:48.666 --> 13:51.766
Right.
You've got a picture of your
cat under each of your farts.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.100
It's not my cat.
It's just a barn cat.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.733

with a barn cat on top
of my truck one time, fuck.

13:57.766 --> 14:00.166
What's the nature of
that, David Suzuki?

14:00.200 --> 14:04.633
No one cares
about your
cat's farts.

14:04.666 --> 14:05.833
But look how cute they are.

14:05.866 --> 14:09.712
Not to be impolite,
but you're the only one
who thinks so.

14:09.746 --> 14:12.746
Everybody whose
got a cat or a kid,

14:12.779 --> 14:16.346
is going to think their cat's
or kid's farts are
super special and unique.

14:16.379 --> 14:19.779
They're not.
They are just a cat
or a kid fart.

14:19.812 --> 14:24.179
In addition, you've been
updating new farts
from your cat almost hourly.

14:24.212 --> 14:27.212
Oh, that's because there's
so many cute farts.
Like I can't even keep up.

is this fucking gong show?

all this duster's farts
on Fartbook.

you wanna fucking wheel him.

you wanna turn on the jets.

his farts?

Yes.

and no farts

15:49.479 --> 15:52.046
but are friends
with everyone along
for the test drive.

15:52.079 --> 15:54.346
Hmm. I'm not friends
with everyone.

I'm not friends
with Wayne yet.
But I wanna be.

you were just cruising
through Fartbook

on everyone's farts but
contributing nothing yourself.

16:05.746 --> 16:07.279

is called creeping.

Not what Fartbook
is all about.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.979
I genuinely enjoy farts.

creeping other people's farts.

is wrong with that?

16:26.812 --> 16:29.679

to misuse Fartbook,

16:29.712 --> 16:31.679

and already folks
are gettin' chapped asses.

Not ours.

17:13.246 --> 17:15.246
This is our problem.

17:15.279 --> 17:18.846
We started Fartbook so that
good folks could share farts
with other good folks.

17:18.879 --> 17:20.079
That's it.

17:20.112 --> 17:23.212
Not to creepin' farts,
or spam farts...

17:23.246 --> 17:25.446
Although, if you eat spam,
you'll get good farts.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.346
Farts should never come
between the love of a man
and a woman.

17:28.379 --> 17:31.812
It's not right.
You don't get
to 500 million farts

17:31.846 --> 17:33.312
without making a few sharts.

17:33.946 --> 17:35.212
Exactly.

17:36.046 --> 17:37.746
So, what are you saying?

17:41.012 --> 17:42.346
Fartbook dies today.

Today, Fartbook is dead.

I'm with the fellas
on this one.

It's not why
we invented it.

17:53.312 --> 17:54.812
You invented it?
Our idea.

17:55.446 --> 17:56.712
We built the site.

18:01.179 --> 18:04.346
You know, you really
don't need a forensics team
to get to the bottom of this.

18:04.379 --> 18:07.879
If you were
the inventors of Fartbook,
you'd have invented Fartbook.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.246
Hold your horses there.
Let's put this to a vote.

18:11.912 --> 18:14.879

Fartbook, raise your hands.

18:17.412 --> 18:18.912

18:20.779 --> 18:23.779
But we own 30 percent.

of our attention.

for your attention?

is back at the offices
of Fartbook,

capable of doing.

coming back
for 30 percent,

19:40.346 --> 19:41.912
Too much, likely.

19:41.946 --> 19:43.379
I was always checking it.

19:43.412 --> 19:45.146
It was very addicting.

stop to think about one thing,
did you?

so aggressively.

20:49.879 --> 20:51.346
Or can I?

20:51.379 --> 20:53.412
You stole our idea.
Hmm...

20:53.446 --> 20:55.979
Are you referring
to Christian Fart Mingle?

20:56.012 --> 20:57.246
What's that?

It's like Christian Mingle,
but for farts.

with our idea

21:01.046 --> 21:02.979

Oh, my God.

allegations you are firing,

All of them, completely
fricken' false. Baseless.

21:14.112 --> 21:15.779
How?

21:15.812 --> 21:17.979
Stewart, I did not
steal anything.

21:18.012 --> 21:19.379
Because the last time
I checked,

21:19.412 --> 21:22.679
taking advantage
of a growing trend
was not stealing.

21:22.712 --> 21:24.846
What trend?
I'll tell you.

21:24.879 --> 21:26.146
But first, let's sing a hymn.
No.

21:26.179 --> 21:28.046

Fine.

a good idea, all right?

21:30.746 --> 21:32.812
You had a terrific idea.
Congratulations.

you were the only ones
in the world to have it?

What are you talking about?

Fart culture, Stewart.
It's all the rage.

21:51.674 --> 21:52.641
Ever heard of Plenty of Farts?

21:54.541 --> 21:56.374
I've heard of Plenty of Fish.

21:56.407 --> 21:59.474
It's very much like that,
except for farts.

21:59.507 --> 22:00.907
Here. Here's the one
I like the best.

22:01.841 --> 22:03.474
It's called Fart Filter.

22:03.507 --> 22:06.574
And I like it because you can
put different filters on all
of your farts and it's fun.

22:06.607 --> 22:07.907
So, yeah, I'll just
show you how it works.

22:07.941 --> 22:10.007
This one, no filter. Nothing.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.974
(FART RECORDING PLAYING)

22:14.474 --> 22:16.807
Who cares? Not Glen, right?

22:16.841 --> 22:20.741
Vanilla. Pedestrian...
I'm not interested.

22:20.774 --> 22:24.007
However, shove that baby
through the Hudson filter...

22:24.041 --> 22:26.007
What's she gonna sound like?

22:26.041 --> 22:27.874
(FART SCALING UPWARD)

22:29.607 --> 22:31.707
Now there's a renovation.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.441
Now suck on
your Sutro filter...

22:34.474 --> 22:36.074
(DISTORTED FART RECORDING)

22:37.941 --> 22:39.907
(EXCLAIMS)

22:39.941 --> 22:42.041
Now boys, because
I'm feeling generous,

22:42.074 --> 22:45.007
and we're in the Lord's house,
I'm gonna play you

22:45.041 --> 22:48.341
the filter that
I invented myself.
I call it...

22:49.507 --> 22:50.907
Valencia.

22:52.707 --> 22:54.707
(FART RECORDING PLAYING)

23:00.941 --> 23:02.674
Wow.

23:02.707 --> 23:05.074
There is a whole site
devoted to gluten‐free farts.

23:05.107 --> 23:07.841
The point is,
it's out there, boys.

23:07.874 --> 23:10.507
It's happened.
The idea lives in the world.

23:10.541 --> 23:12.841
Y'all are too slow.
Slow on the uptake.

23:12.874 --> 23:15.141
Sad story. Boo‐hoo. Toot‐toot!

23:15.174 --> 23:16.641
Go away.
(HOARSELY) Let's go.

23:17.807 --> 23:19.607
GLEN: Sad face, sad face,
angry face.

23:22.441 --> 23:24.474
(FART RECORDING PLAYING)

23:28.807 --> 23:30.774
Better slow down there,
Big‐shoots.

23:30.807 --> 23:32.041
Tomorrow's gonna be
a great day for hay.

23:32.074 --> 23:35.807
If you can be a man at night,
you can be a man
in the morning.

23:35.841 --> 23:37.441
Wayne, how come you
didn't join Fartbook?

23:37.474 --> 23:40.641
'Cause you're not supposed
to fart in front of girls.
What?

23:40.674 --> 23:43.941
There's certain things that
should stay sacred between
a man and a woman.

23:43.974 --> 23:46.974
So, all things considered,
this whole thing's
pretty fucking juvenile,

23:47.007 --> 23:48.974
if I do say so myself.

23:49.007 --> 23:51.107
If she's always listening
to your ass acoustics,

23:51.141 --> 23:52.574
or even worse,
smellin' 'em,

23:52.607 --> 23:56.041
I guarantee she'll be slower
and slower to crawl into bed
with you at night.

23:56.074 --> 23:58.541
What you just said
is outrageous.

23:58.574 --> 24:00.141
No it isn't. It's true.

24:00.174 --> 24:02.974
I don't wanna be smelling
a dude's ass all the time.
Get real.

24:03.007 --> 24:05.141
What are you?
Some kind of fart purist?

24:05.174 --> 24:07.407
So what are you
supposed to do?
Just hold it in?

24:07.441 --> 24:09.374
Or take a shit,
you fuckin' degenerate.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.774
Speaking of shit,

24:10.807 --> 24:12.774
my second cousin's got IBS.

24:12.807 --> 24:14.774
Who, Garrett?
No, Jarett.

24:14.807 --> 24:18.907
DAN: No.
IBS, the International
Business Solution?

24:18.941 --> 24:21.941
IBS stands for
Irritable Bowel Syndromes.

24:21.974 --> 24:25.741
Anyhoo, when he was a kid,
Jackass comes out on the air,

24:25.774 --> 24:28.441
so it becomes real popular
in his high school,

24:28.474 --> 24:31.674
for kids to start taking shits
in places what weren't meant
for taking shits in.

24:31.707 --> 24:33.074
They calls that
guerrilla shittin'.

24:33.107 --> 24:34.741
Is this a true story?

24:34.774 --> 24:36.874
So, he became real popular
with his friends,

24:36.907 --> 24:40.474
with his ability to take
a shits any time he needed to.

24:40.507 --> 24:42.407
They'd call him up
when they get an idea

24:42.441 --> 24:44.374
of a place that needed
a shits taken in,

24:44.407 --> 24:46.874
and be like,
"Hey, why don't you comes
over here and takes a shits?"

24:46.907 --> 24:49.707
Anyhow, this one time
his pal texts him up,

24:49.741 --> 24:52.807
and he says, "Hey,
why don't you come take a
shits in the girls' bathroom?"

24:52.841 --> 24:55.007
So, he drinks a coffee,
eats a bran muffin,

24:55.041 --> 24:56.841
heads on down
to the washroom there,

24:56.874 --> 24:58.874
but when he opens
the bathroom door,
what does he find?

24:58.907 --> 25:00.941
But this pretty young girl
just dropping a shits,

25:00.974 --> 25:02.841
right there
in the middle
of the bathroom floor.

25:02.874 --> 25:04.741
And that's how he met
his lovely Eunice.

25:04.774 --> 25:07.374
And they fells in love,
and they've been together
ever since.

25:07.407 --> 25:09.907
They raised
three little shits. So...

25:09.941 --> 25:12.674
With all due respect,
Miss Katy,

25:12.707 --> 25:17.074
there is a market
for gentlemens what can find
ladies who like, uh, farts,

25:17.107 --> 25:19.507
or shits,
or even guerrilla shittin's.

25:19.541 --> 25:21.974
That is not a true story.

25:22.007 --> 25:23.741
That is a true story.

25:23.774 --> 25:25.907
God help us all.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.674
You know what, I don't know
why you guys need everybody
knowing your business anyway.

25:29.707 --> 25:32.541
Like why you gotta put
everything on the internet,
while you're doing it,

25:32.574 --> 25:33.907
or after you're done doing it?

25:33.941 --> 25:35.674
Well, if you don't puts it
on the internet,

25:35.707 --> 25:37.374
how's gonna people know
what you did?

25:37.407 --> 25:39.141
Do you wanna know what?
That's your problem
right there.

25:39.174 --> 25:41.741
Should be playing your cards
close to your chest.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.041
Keep the ladies
guessin' a little bit.
Be the mystery man.

25:44.074 --> 25:45.607
Right again.

25:45.641 --> 25:47.907
Oh, if a woman's not gonna
love me for my farts

25:47.941 --> 25:50.674
or for me posting
my bowling scores
on the internet...

25:51.874 --> 25:53.541
Not really sure
I want one.

25:53.574 --> 25:55.841
Well, then it's a good thing
you's two have each other.
