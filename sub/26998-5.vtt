WEBVTT

01:57.075 --> 01:58.284
That's nasty!

02:02.330 --> 02:06.501
Oh, for the love of Lucifer, Hilda,
will you please calm down?

02:06.793 --> 02:09.254
Sorry. It's just it's rather good.

02:09.754 --> 02:10.630
Saucy.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.966
There's only one book
you should be reading, sister,

02:13.049 --> 02:14.843
in light of your excommunication.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.846
Our Dark Lord's Satanic Bible.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.475
It's nice to have Sabrina back home,
isn't it?

02:23.518 --> 02:24.894
I missed her terribly.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.106
If Sabrina's three-day absence
so affected you,

02:28.189 --> 02:30.900
perhaps your life could do
with some more purpose.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.611
Actually, now that you mention it,

02:33.695 --> 02:37.448
I have been thinking about applying
for a job at the bookstore in town.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.284
Dr. Cerberus's bookstore.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.995
You mean that hovel
run by that lunatic trash-peddler

02:42.078 --> 02:44.247
-who dresses up like a vampire?
-Yeah.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.541
And what about your duties here,
at the mortuary?

02:46.624 --> 02:51.796
For Satan's sake, Zelda, must you be
negative about every idea I have?

02:51.880 --> 02:55.758
Honestly!
Sometimes, it just makes me want to--

02:55.842 --> 02:58.136
Sabrina?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.181
Wha-- What's the matter?

03:01.431 --> 03:04.309
When I solved the puzzle,
the Acheron Configuration,

03:04.392 --> 03:07.729
it set a demon free, and now it's loose.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.147
What kind of demon

03:09.230 --> 03:11.858
I don't know, a demon-demon.
A scary demon.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.067
Calm down.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.195
If the entity came out of
the Acheron Configuration,

03:15.278 --> 03:17.197
it can be put back into the Configuration.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.698
Where is it

03:18.781 --> 03:21.201
-I must've left it in my room.
-Spellmans.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.413
Well, this is simply perfect.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.332
Come on.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.920
-Follow me. Quickly!

03:42.430 --> 03:43.848
Quickly. Downstairs.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.604
Sabrina, what the devil is going on?

03:49.687 --> 03:52.440
Not the devil, Ambrose, a demon!

03:52.523 --> 03:54.400
-In the house!
-What do you mean "a demon"?

03:54.484 --> 03:55.401
What kind of demon?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.779
Whatever kind it is,
we have protocols in place.

03:57.862 --> 04:01.032
-We do?
-We seal the house to contain the entity,

04:01.115 --> 04:02.867
to prevent it from escaping
into the world,

04:02.951 --> 04:05.078
where it would cause
rampant, wanton chaos.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.496
-Oh, right.
-That's right.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.538
Okay, let's do this.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.628
Ex spiritibus enim sie te aeris.

04:13.711 --> 04:18.341
Qui Omnipotentiam Tuam parcendo clavem ad.

04:18.424 --> 04:23.513
Ostium ligate Diabolum hunc!

04:23.596 --> 04:28.643
Hoc captionem,
et daemonium ab grandus cincinno.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.106
Spellmans.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.068
You're his family, aren't you?

04:37.151 --> 04:39.028
My captor's kin.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.156
You smell like Spellmans.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.825
Know this, demon.

04:44.409 --> 04:48.830
Our house is sealed with an incantation
we, and only we, know.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.207
If you harm us, you'll never escape it.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.418
Another prison?

04:54.252 --> 04:55.878
No, no, no!

04:56.212 --> 05:00.633
Edward Spellman imprisoned me
in the Acheron puzzle for 70 years.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.261
I'll not be caged again!

05:03.720 --> 05:05.138
What do you want, Hellspawn?

05:05.346 --> 05:10.310
First, revenge on the family
of Edward Spellman.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.354
-Did you have to ask, love?
-And then, freedom,

05:13.438 --> 05:18.484
so I may fill the world
with my sublime nightmares.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.700
I don't understand. Nightmares?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.493
It's a sleep demon!

05:27.577 --> 05:30.079
Zelda, if it puts us to sleep,
we're at its mercy.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.958
Thank you for stating the obvious, Hilda,
but not to worry.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.460
It won't get the chance to.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.463
Aunt Zelda,
whatever you're about to do, do it fast.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.800
Turpis et infernis in terris pariunt.

05:42.884 --> 05:47.430
Adiuro vos tamen hoc graecas munus.

05:55.938 --> 05:57.273
And that is how you trap a demon.

05:57.940 --> 06:04.572
A nice pot of calming tea
might help soothe all our nerves.

06:04.655 --> 06:07.241
My nerves are perfectly fine, sister.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.119
Which is more than I can say for you lot.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.872
Running around like headless chickens.

06:12.955 --> 06:17.210
At least this means Father Blackwood has
to let me into conjuring class now, right?

06:17.293 --> 06:20.088
I mean, I solved the Configuration.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.465
And learned a valuable lesson, I hope.

06:22.757 --> 06:26.302
Never open a magic box
if you don't know what's inside it.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.180
One thing I don't understand.

06:29.889 --> 06:33.393
Why would my father trap a demon
inside of it?

06:35.144 --> 06:39.107
Uh... Your father suffered
from terrible insomnia.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.901
He always said
it was a sleep demon tormenting him.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.862
All those years, I assumed
he was speaking metaphorically,

06:44.946 --> 06:46.697
but clearly not.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.534
And clearly, he got the better of it.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.121
Surely, he must have known
the Configuration would be opened one day?

06:53.371 --> 06:56.916
Or, perhaps, he never imagined
that anyone would be canny enough

06:56.999 --> 06:58.584
to solve his puzzle.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.461
My mom was the key.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.046
Hmm?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.591
A sketch of her in one of Dad's journals
gave me the clue to unlock it.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.345
Witches couldn't solve it,
but a half-witch could.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.682
Oh-- Oh, that's marvelous, isn't it Zelds?

07:12.765 --> 07:15.935
Yes, it's divine that Sabrina's duality
almost got us killed.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.895
Right.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.774
Okay, well let's-- let's finish our tea
and call it a night, shall we?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.735
Have a little foxglove to help me sleep.

07:25.111 --> 07:29.240
Snug as a bug in a rug.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.994
Auntie Hilda, what would have happened
if we hadn't re-trapped the demon?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.747
I mean, we...
wouldn't even be aware of this,

07:36.831 --> 07:40.877
but... I imagine
she would've lulled us to sleep,

07:41.419 --> 07:45.089
separated us
so that our dreams don't cross over,

07:45.173 --> 07:48.134
and then plagued us
with horrific nightmares.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.719
Wh--

07:50.470 --> 07:52.763
-Why?
-Oh, so she could torture us

07:53.139 --> 07:58.603
until one of us broke ranks
to unseal the house and set her free.

08:00.354 --> 08:04.192
But I don't want you to think
of such sinister things before bed.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.321
Good night, my darling.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.662
Dream of sweet kisses...

08:18.331 --> 08:22.001
-and a world full of love and joy.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.880
With no darkness, no shadows.

08:27.840 --> 08:33.304
At least, not at first.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.768
Batibat, is that you?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.144
Who...?

08:41.979 --> 08:44.982
You know me. Look closer.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.860
-Mother of Demons.
-That's right.

08:47.944 --> 08:49.820
You abandoned me, Mother.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.533
You left me to rot
inside the Configuration.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.495
Do not harm a hair on that child's head.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.540
The spawn of Spellman have sealed me
in this house,

09:00.623 --> 09:03.501
no one in or out, not even you.

09:03.751 --> 09:09.757
And so, I shall plunder their minds
and orchestrate a symphony of nightmares

09:10.258 --> 09:12.093
until one of them cracks like an egg

09:12.176 --> 09:14.762
and tells me the spell
that unlocks this house.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.348
And then, Demon Mother...

09:19.350 --> 09:21.519
I will slaughter them,

09:21.978 --> 09:25.481
one... by... one.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.858
I'm warning you.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.238
A familiar.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.324
Can't have that on the loose.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.995
-Here, kitty, kitty...
-Batibat?

09:39.620 --> 09:41.956
The Dark Lord forbids it. I forbid it.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.920
Here, kitty, kitty...

09:58.889 --> 10:00.141
What is your problem?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.602
Heard you're thinking about running
for Prom Queen.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.562
A piece of friendly advice, Spellman?

10:04.812 --> 10:05.771
Don't.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.525
No half-breed's gonna
represent Baxter High up on that stage.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.985
That crown will be ours.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.575
Ignore them, they're just jealous.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.411
Because I'm the daughter of a High Priest?

10:21.162 --> 10:23.247
Because of how beautiful
you are, Sabrina.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.000
How effortlessly charming, how funny...

10:27.043 --> 10:29.587
how infuriatingly right
you always seem to be.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.966
Speaking of prom, I was going to ask you--

10:34.050 --> 10:35.593
Sabrina! Hey, guys.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.888
What's up, Nick?

10:39.388 --> 10:40.514
'Sup, Kinkle?

10:42.975 --> 10:45.728
Can I talk to you in private?
It's pretty important.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.901
I've been thinking...

10:52.568 --> 10:53.986
before too much longer,

10:54.070 --> 10:57.239
we're gonna be applying to colleges,
and who knows where we're gonna end up,

10:57.323 --> 10:58.949
-maybe at different schools.
-Wait.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.452
Are you breaking up with me?

11:02.119 --> 11:03.037
What? No!

11:03.412 --> 11:04.997
No. You're my everything.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.875
I never want to lose you.

11:09.585 --> 11:10.628
That's why...

11:13.339 --> 11:14.715
Oh, my God.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.008
Sabrina Spellman...

11:23.307 --> 11:24.266
will you marry me?

11:28.270 --> 11:29.730
Don't do it, Sabrina.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.650
You're a witch, he's a mortal.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.612
Worlds that are, and will always be,
diametrically opposed.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.822
But Mom and Dad--

11:37.905 --> 11:40.908
Flouted convention,
and where are they now?

11:41.367 --> 11:43.619
They're both D-E-A-D. Dead.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.374
What about that nice,
handsome warlock, Nicholas Scratch?

11:50.209 --> 11:52.169
We're barely friends, we just met.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.171
How much do you love Harvey?

11:54.255 --> 11:57.174
Do you love him as much as
your father did your mother?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.552
I think I do.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.640
Well, if that is the case,
then you must be honest with him.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.894
If he truly loves you,
he will accept you for what you are.

12:14.775 --> 12:19.321
Your attempts to conciliate your duality
will only bring you pain and suffering.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.125
Harvey?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.670
Sabrina, what are you doing?

12:34.754 --> 12:37.715
It's bad luck for the groom to see
the bride in her dress before the wedding.

12:37.798 --> 12:41.093
I know.
But things are moving so fast, and...

12:42.011 --> 12:43.888
there's something I need to tell you.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.809
And... it's either now
or forever hold my peace,

12:48.893 --> 12:51.270
and that-that-that
wouldn't be fair to you.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.857
You're shaking. What is it?

12:57.234 --> 13:00.279
Harvey... I'm a witch.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.411
Why am I suddenly having
a strange sense of déjà vu?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.540
Because I told you once. In the woods.
And then I made you forget.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.378
Huh!

13:18.589 --> 13:19.965
What's funny is, I think...

13:21.675 --> 13:23.427
a part of me always remembered...

13:24.678 --> 13:26.347
even after you made me forget.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.057
Should I not have told you?

13:28.766 --> 13:31.018
I love you, Sabrina.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.314
I always have, and I always will.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.233
But is that enough?

13:38.317 --> 13:42.488
-Your family isn't even coming tonight.
-Dad and Tommy are busy in the mines.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.199
We're not doing this for them.

13:47.117 --> 13:47.952
Marry me...

13:49.078 --> 13:51.080
and I will make you the happiest woman...

13:51.872 --> 13:55.251
and witch... of all time.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.548
You look stunning.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.426
I mean, seriously.

14:05.886 --> 14:06.804
I'm stunned.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.515
Nick, you should be in the parlor
with everyone else.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.935
Listen, it's not too late to run.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.146
-What are you talking about?
-You and me.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.607
A witch and warlock. How it should be.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.528
We can hop on this broom
and fly off and never look back.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
I couldn't do that to Harvey.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.534
He loves me.

14:29.827 --> 14:33.038
He knows what I am and he loves me.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.337
Thank you, Daddy.

15:12.244 --> 15:16.707
Dearly Beloved, we are gathered here today
in the presence of these witnesses

15:16.790 --> 15:21.837
to join this witch and this mortal
in the bonds of holy,

15:22.046 --> 15:24.632
and unholy, matrimony.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.928
If any person can show just cause

15:29.011 --> 15:31.680
as to why these two
should not be joined together,

15:31.764 --> 15:34.683
let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.895
Stop!

15:38.312 --> 15:39.605
Stop the wedding!

15:41.649 --> 15:44.610
Why, Sabrina

15:44.860 --> 15:46.070
Harvey! Harvey!

15:46.153 --> 15:49.657
It would've been fine
if you just hadn't told me.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.493
Kill the witch, Harvey!

15:52.576 --> 15:53.702
-Kill the witch!
-Kill her!

15:53.786 --> 15:57.206
-Witch! Kill the witch!
-Kill the witch!

15:57.289 --> 15:58.791
Kill her, Harvey!

16:02.920 --> 16:04.672
Stop! What are you doing?

16:04.755 --> 16:07.758
"Thou shall not suffer a witch to live."

16:26.610 --> 16:28.070
Poor Spellman.

16:28.153 --> 16:31.198
Rejected, tortured,
by the mortals you so love.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.242
Tell me, does it hurt?

16:33.450 --> 16:34.827
Are you in agony?

16:34.910 --> 16:37.454
Please! Please let me out!

16:37.955 --> 16:39.289
But of course, my sweet.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.084
Tell me the spell that unseals this house.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.337
No. No! I won't!

16:45.421 --> 16:48.298
Not now, perhaps, but soon.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.719
I'll be listening for your cries.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.724
Kill the witch! Kill the witch!

16:56.807 --> 16:59.977
-Kill the witch!

17:00.519 --> 17:03.355
Here, kitty, kitty...

17:04.773 --> 17:07.693
I won't hurt you, kitty cat.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.821
Where are you, kitty cat?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.824
Here, kitty, kitty...
That's all it takes, isn't it?

17:13.907 --> 17:16.118
Humdrum little thing you are.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.247
Oh, Ambrose, there you are.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.832
We've just had a body arrive.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.794
Down in the morgue. A young lad.
Brutally stabbed to death, by all reports.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.212
-Really?
-Hmm.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.674
-By a spurned, jealous lover?
-No, nothing like that.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.676
The victim was a tragic shut-in.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.720
Lived alone, poor creature.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.932
No friends, no one to mourn him,
no one to miss him.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.768
Come on.

17:51.653 --> 17:52.571
Oh.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.615
He's handsome, don't you reckon?

17:54.865 --> 17:57.659
Oh, it's always sadder
when they're handsome, isn't it?

17:57.743 --> 17:59.953
-Don't know why that is, but it is.
-Um...

18:00.037 --> 18:02.331
Does he not remind you of anyone, Auntie?

18:02.414 --> 18:04.583
Uh, no, I don't think-- Should he?

18:05.334 --> 18:09.296
Anyway, I'm off to Sabrina's
parent-teacher conference,

18:09.379 --> 18:11.882
so, uh, I'll leave you to do the autopsy.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.766
Alas, poor Ambrose.

18:23.018 --> 18:24.269
I knew him well.

18:36.740 --> 18:41.662
"A fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy."

18:43.080 --> 18:44.164
Tell me...

18:46.166 --> 18:47.459
what did you do?

18:49.586 --> 18:52.047
What was it all for, your life?

18:54.383 --> 18:55.509
Did you love?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.720
And were you loved in return?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.180
Does it matter?

19:00.722 --> 19:01.974
Any of it?

19:03.433 --> 19:07.437
Ashes to ashes, dust to...

19:08.856 --> 19:11.441
Ambrose. Whatever were you doing?

19:13.944 --> 19:17.281
Now that you've done it,
how does it taste, your heart?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.159
Bitter.

19:20.450 --> 19:24.955
Well, never mind all that.
The High Priest has come to see you,

19:25.038 --> 19:29.376
so clean yourself up
and get upstairs, chop-chop.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.726
Oh! I'm so sorry! I...

19:46.560 --> 19:49.229
-Uh, can I help you, madam?
-Uh...

19:49.438 --> 19:50.856
I'm looking for someone.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.483
Not you.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.406
You-- You're lost, then?

19:59.615 --> 20:00.616
Yes.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.783
I believe I'm...

20:04.161 --> 20:05.579
in the wrong nightmare.

20:13.337 --> 20:16.423
This afternoon I chaired
a meeting of the Infernal Parole Board.

20:16.715 --> 20:20.052
We reviewed the charges brought
against you by the Church of Night,

20:20.135 --> 20:21.762
under the stewardship of...

20:23.555 --> 20:24.848
Edward Spellman.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.019
I-- I don't understand, Your Excellency.
What are you saying?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.813
I'm saying that the hex
that keeps you imprisoned in this house,

20:31.897 --> 20:34.566
Brother Ambrose, is,
as of this moment, broken.

20:40.781 --> 20:41.740
I'm free?

20:42.532 --> 20:44.826
I'm finally free.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.458
Inside this,

20:51.541 --> 20:54.086
you'll find all the money you need
for expenses and such...

20:55.712 --> 20:56.755
new clothes.

20:58.048 --> 21:01.426
There is a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.692
-Love you.
-Love you too.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.381
He's handsome, don't you reckon?

21:39.881 --> 21:42.926
Does he not remind you of anyone, Auntie

21:43.635 --> 21:44.594
No. Should he?

21:45.304 --> 21:46.805
No. Anyway...

21:47.180 --> 21:49.599
I'm off to Sabrina's
parent-teacher conference,

21:49.683 --> 21:52.311
so, uh, I'll leave you to do the autopsy.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.689
Auntie, wait!
What's happening? Don't-- Don't leave me.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.609
No, no, no... No!

22:04.656 --> 22:06.450
Poor, pitiable creature.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.454
Trapped in existential solitude,
forever and ever.

22:11.830 --> 22:16.460
Tell me the spell that unlocks the house
and I'll end your lonely torment.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.754
No! No! Auntie Hilda!

22:19.171 --> 22:20.797
Come back! Aunt Hilda!

22:20.881 --> 22:21.965
She's gone.

22:23.008 --> 22:27.929
But I'll be back, when your will is gone
and your tongue is loose.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.681
Help! Please!

22:29.973 --> 22:33.226
It will be you, I think,
that breaks first.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.478
You...

22:35.395 --> 22:37.105
or the bubbly one.

22:44.029 --> 22:44.863
Oh!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.657
Spellman Sisters Mortuary,
how may I help you?

22:49.034 --> 22:49.868
Oh!

22:51.703 --> 22:54.873
But of course, Principal Hawthorne...

22:54.956 --> 22:57.417
...I'll be there straight away! Ta!

22:57.626 --> 23:00.045
I have a confession to make, Ms. Spellman.

23:00.295 --> 23:04.716
I didn't, uh, invite you in today
to discuss Sabrina.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.009
That was, uh...

23:08.220 --> 23:09.930
wily subterfuge on my part.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.224
Oh, so she's not in trouble?

23:12.474 --> 23:14.101
Oh, far from it. No.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.310
Oh.

23:15.477 --> 23:19.731
Sabrina is a model pupil.
And I have wanted to say to you,

23:19.815 --> 23:23.402
I so admire how involved you are
in her life.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.112
I try to be.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.659
My sister, Zelda,
she couldn't really care less

23:31.201 --> 23:34.538
about Sabrina's
more traditional education,

23:34.621 --> 23:37.541
but I would like my niece
to be well-rounded.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.501
Indeed.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.047
Well-rounded.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.678
Much like her Aunt Hilda.

23:50.846 --> 23:51.930
-Come again?

23:54.349 --> 23:58.979
I am looking for Sabrina.
Have either of you...

24:00.480 --> 24:01.398
seen her?

24:01.648 --> 24:02.816
Not for ages.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.444
And as you can see, uh, Ms. Wardwell,

24:05.527 --> 24:07.904
we are right in the middle
of a tête-à-tête, so...

24:08.196 --> 24:09.489
I'll let you get back to it, then.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.083
You were saying, Mr. Hawthorne?

24:20.167 --> 24:21.543
Please call me George.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.711
George.

24:23.587 --> 24:24.463
And you...

24:26.173 --> 24:27.257
Please, please...

24:30.302 --> 24:34.181
Please, will you allow me
to cook for you this evening?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.391
Cook?

24:36.475 --> 24:37.809
For...?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.439
No one's ever cooked for me before.

24:42.564 --> 24:46.443
Does he know you're a virgin

24:47.194 --> 24:48.028
Vile.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.448
If you have nothing nice to say,

24:51.531 --> 24:55.577
then please, please,
stay out of the way tonight.

24:55.702 --> 24:57.746
First floor, off-limits.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.999
You do realize
you're going to have to put out.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.543
That's the only way
you'll ever hold his interest.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.003
Please, just...

25:05.086 --> 25:09.049
...help me pick it out
because I want to look my best.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.681
"You can't polish a turd."

25:17.265 --> 25:20.769
Devil's Hooves, Zelda,
be supportive for once!

25:21.228 --> 25:23.230
Don't you take that tone with me.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.607
You never want me to be happy, do you?

25:25.690 --> 25:29.319
You've never wanted me to live my life.
I'm sick to death of it!

25:30.487 --> 25:33.031
I'm sick to death of being
the put upon one.

25:33.114 --> 25:36.785
I'm sick of being treated like dirt
by my own flesh and blood.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.371
I'm sick of being the afterthought,
the joke.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.625
You'll never be happy, Hilda.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.919
Because who could love you?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.259
Uh...

25:54.261 --> 25:55.095
Yeah.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.556
That's much better.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.978
For years she's been putting me down

26:03.228 --> 26:05.105
and holding me back and...

26:05.188 --> 26:06.773
...and telling me I'm no good.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.651
Oh! And killing me, literally...

26:10.360 --> 26:11.903
...and metaphorically.

26:11.987 --> 26:15.240
But she's not gonna do it anymore.
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Insufferable bitch.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.825
This is nice!

26:18.076 --> 26:20.579
I'm so sorry.
I've just been going on about Zelda.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.122
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, Zelda...

26:22.497 --> 26:24.624
Tell me about you.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.460
Do you have any siblings?

26:27.919 --> 26:29.045
I had a brother.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.883
But, uh... he was stillborn.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.218
Mmm.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.387
I'm so sorry. That's awful.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.098
-I mourn the man he could have been.

26:47.939 --> 26:48.898
To you...

26:49.691 --> 26:51.568
dear, sweet...

26:52.444 --> 26:54.404
voluptuous Hilda.

26:57.115 --> 26:59.743
Here's to us, Mr. Haw--

27:01.286 --> 27:02.370
George.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.753
I'm as pissed as a fart!

27:09.836 --> 27:12.005
-Watch your step.

27:12.088 --> 27:16.259
Oh, I haven't been this drunk,
you know, since...

27:16.343 --> 27:18.094
...Queen Victoria's coronation.

27:18.511 --> 27:21.556
I woke-- woke up
on the banks of the Thames.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.891
Naked.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.145
I think I'm going to be a little bit sick.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.899
Wait. I'm going to do this.

27:33.735 --> 27:38.031
Sleep tight, my angel, my salvation.

27:47.707 --> 27:51.086
Mother said I was
such a naughty boy because...

27:52.128 --> 27:55.423
I absorbed him, you see.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.551
In the womb.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.471
Ate him.

28:02.138 --> 28:03.598
My very own brother.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.354
Gobbled him up
like a greedy little piggy.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.568
I've carried this burden with me
all of my life.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.073
The terror of...

28:20.782 --> 28:24.035
of not knowing
if I would ever find love...

28:25.286 --> 28:26.705
and-- and connection.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.373
But then...

28:29.124 --> 28:33.211
it turned out all I needed to do was
meet someone who was just the same as me.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.338
And him.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.215
Hilda...

28:38.508 --> 28:40.260
I'd like you to...

28:41.678 --> 28:44.931
meet my brother, Bob.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.876
No!

29:19.507 --> 29:22.802
Oh, poor Hilda.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.514
Tell me the spell
that unlocks this house...

29:27.307 --> 29:29.934
and I'll separate you from your dark half.

29:32.228 --> 29:34.647
"But of the fruit of the tree,
in the garden,

29:34.731 --> 29:39.027
the False God said,
"Ye shall not eat of it,

29:39.360 --> 29:43.239
neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye shall die."

29:45.325 --> 29:50.205
But, did Eve die
when she ate the fruit, children?

29:50.288 --> 29:51.164
No.

29:51.247 --> 29:54.209
No. Of course not.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.295
The False God lied to Eve,

29:57.378 --> 30:02.509
because he desired to keep her
naked and ignorant in his garden.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.137
But our Lord Satan,

30:06.721 --> 30:08.473
inhabiting a snake,

30:08.973 --> 30:12.977
gave Eve knowledge, and set her free.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.277
Sister Zelda.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.655
We bring you news from the Nine Circles.

30:23.738 --> 30:27.158
Our Dark Lord has chosen your house
for a special honor.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.119
Once a year, he assumes the shape of man

30:30.203 --> 30:32.622
to visit his most devout disciples,

30:32.705 --> 30:34.123
and break bread with them.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.918
This year, Our Dark Lord

30:37.001 --> 30:39.879
has chosen you and your sister
for that distinction.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.715
He will honor you
with his presence at dinner...

30:45.301 --> 30:46.302
tonight.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.103
Hilda! Oh, Hilda!

30:56.896 --> 30:57.730
Yeah?

30:58.189 --> 31:00.650
The Dark Lord is dining with us!

31:01.234 --> 31:03.611
Tonight! Can you imagine?

31:04.112 --> 31:05.113
Aw!

31:05.196 --> 31:08.074
I'll lay on my vegetable pie then.
That's always a winner.

31:08.157 --> 31:10.368
Not for the Dark Lord, sister.

31:10.451 --> 31:12.120
He's an avowed carnivore.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.206
Oh. Pity we don't have time
to fatten a calf.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.835
Should I nip to the butcher's
and see if he can give me a roast?

31:19.919 --> 31:20.753
No need.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.340
There's a choice morsel close at hand.

31:27.635 --> 31:28.970
Isn't that right, Fergus?

31:41.774 --> 31:43.902
Get that, won't you?

31:55.288 --> 31:56.414
Dark Lord!

32:01.628 --> 32:02.587
Now, then.

32:03.713 --> 32:05.965
What have you prepared for me,
daughter Hilda?

32:06.132 --> 32:08.509
Oh! It's a vegetable pie, Dark Lord.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.429
Does it contain onions?

32:11.721 --> 32:14.098
No, Dark Lord.
I know you don't like onions.

32:14.557 --> 32:15.433
Hmm.

32:15.808 --> 32:18.144
And what have you prepared for me,
daughter Zelda?

32:18.227 --> 32:20.480
I've made your favorite, Dark Lord.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.484
Is this a Christian child
or a Child of Night you've cooked?

32:25.693 --> 32:29.155
It was the plumpest child
I could find, Dark Lord.

32:29.322 --> 32:33.034
But... he... he was a Child of Night.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.788
And with our numbers depleted,
daughter Zelda?

32:38.039 --> 32:40.833
But isn't roast child
your favorite dish, Dark Lord?

32:40.917 --> 32:43.169
I will only eat one dish tonight.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.964
Hilda's vegetable pie.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.304
Shall we eat, then?

32:53.554 --> 32:55.431
Let me serve you, Dark Lord.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.893
And what a vivacious servant you are.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.565
Rest assured, I have a place...

33:07.318 --> 33:09.278
I'll keep my fingers crossed.

33:13.282 --> 33:14.200
Oh.

33:15.451 --> 33:19.080
This is the finest
vegetable pie I have ever eaten.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.208
As succulent as its cook.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.336
You are very, very naughty, Dark Lord.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.296
Tell me, Hilda...

33:28.339 --> 33:31.843
would you indulge me... in a dance?

34:02.040 --> 34:04.459
Goodbye, Dark Lord! Bye!

34:04.709 --> 34:06.377
Don't be a stranger.

34:06.669 --> 34:08.254
Take care now.

34:08.963 --> 34:11.007
Praise you.

34:37.283 --> 34:40.536
You didn't even want
to join the Church of Night.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.373
You never even loved him!

35:09.107 --> 35:11.317
That was a speedy resurrection, sister.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.444
Where is Hilda?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.786
Am I my sister's keeper?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.125
I don't...

35:27.542 --> 35:29.418
I-- I don't know where she is.

35:30.253 --> 35:33.673
Don't lie to me. I am the Father of Lies.
You killed her.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.341
Isn't that so?

35:35.424 --> 35:36.926
I'm sorry, Dark Lord.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.096
But... you don't understand.

35:40.513 --> 35:43.558
This is a little game we play.

35:44.433 --> 35:45.685
Punch and Judy.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.104
She'll come back.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.981
You'll see.

35:50.064 --> 35:53.109
Hilda always comes back.

35:53.401 --> 35:54.569
Not this time.

35:55.236 --> 35:58.281
This time, she is gone from your life...

36:00.616 --> 36:01.576
forever.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.121
No!

36:06.455 --> 36:08.666
No!

36:16.132 --> 36:17.884
No!

36:18.968 --> 36:21.804
Poor Zelda.

36:25.057 --> 36:29.562
Tell me the spell that unlocks this house,
and I'll bring her back to life.

36:34.150 --> 36:36.360
Let me out!

36:36.694 --> 36:39.572
Somebody please help me! Help!

36:39.697 --> 36:42.033
Sabrina?

36:42.158 --> 36:44.827
-Finally.
-Ms. Wardwell?

36:44.911 --> 36:46.996
I need you to calm down.

36:47.663 --> 36:49.290
You're dreaming right now.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.208
No.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.920
Harvey.
Harvey and his family did this to me.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.004
Sabrina, listen to me.

36:55.087 --> 36:59.258
We don't have much time before Batibat
realizes I've been trolling her domain.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.302
What

37:01.385 --> 37:03.012
Batibat. She's a sleep demon.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.389
She manipulates her victims
in their dreams.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.183
She's torturing you, all of you,

37:07.266 --> 37:10.770
until one of you tells her the spell
to unlock the house

37:11.187 --> 37:12.521
or you all go insane.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.732
This is a dream?

37:15.274 --> 37:17.568
Yes. But I'm gonna wake you up.

37:18.611 --> 37:22.531
And once I wake you up,
you must get out of the house. Run.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.659
Run as fast as your legs will carry you.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.787
-It's your only chance of survival.
-The demon said she wanted revenge.

37:27.870 --> 37:32.291
If I escape, what's to stop her
from killing my aunties and Ambrose?

37:32.375 --> 37:36.128
Self-preservation, my dear,
it's the only thing that matters.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.882
Ms. Wardwell, how did you get here...

37:40.549 --> 37:41.592
in my dream?

37:43.469 --> 37:46.973
A gin-clear mind, self-induced sleep,
and clear intent, Sabrina.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.891
I'm gonna wake you up now.

37:49.475 --> 37:52.853
You shall feel a prick,
but remember my words.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.108
Get out of the house. Don't fall asleep.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.987
You'll only have one chance to escape her.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.683
Batibat.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.080
Where did you go, little girl?

39:02.048 --> 39:04.592
Where are you?

39:06.385 --> 39:07.553
Where did you go?

39:13.017 --> 39:16.354
Ambrose. Ambrose!

39:27.073 --> 39:29.075
Ow!

39:29.950 --> 39:30.868
Fine.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.703
I'll just use your books.

39:41.796 --> 39:44.715
Exilium? Exilium...

39:46.926 --> 39:49.178
-is banishment.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.721
Salem!

39:52.473 --> 39:55.101
I know, but I have
the Acheron Configuration,

39:55.184 --> 39:56.894
and I found a spell to banish her.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.314
But I do know her name.

40:00.523 --> 40:04.402
Ms. Wardwell told me it's Batibat,
and that might give me an edge.

40:04.944 --> 40:07.238
But I have to confront her, Salem.

40:07.321 --> 40:10.282
I can't run and leave my family
to be tortured by her.

40:11.367 --> 40:15.246
Right now,
my best shot is to surprise her.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.209
Looking for me?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.713
I banish thee, Batibat.

40:24.797 --> 40:30.094
"Tu me misisti,
et contentiones sint causa doloris mei."

40:30.302 --> 40:32.972
That's but a plaything
in your inexperienced hands.

40:33.639 --> 40:36.058
You're not half the witch your father was.

40:36.142 --> 40:40.146
No witch at all.
No power, no conviction, no will.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.606
And with three other Spellmans
in my thrall,

40:42.690 --> 40:44.316
you, child, may die.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.577
Open Sesame.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.128
Spellman.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.047
Aunt Zelda, wake up!

41:07.131 --> 41:09.258
Aunties, please,
I can't do this on my own!

41:09.341 --> 41:10.426
I need your help!

41:12.052 --> 41:16.432
Salem! Salem, where did you leave Batibat

41:19.643 --> 41:23.189
I don't know, Salem, I need help, I need--

41:26.525 --> 41:29.236
-Wait. I can go back.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.072
Yes, I know Ms. Wardwell said
not to go back to sleep,

41:32.156 --> 41:37.119
but if I were quick enough
and focused enough to lucid dream,

41:37.953 --> 41:40.414
-I could go and come right back.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.459
Well, for starters,
I'd have to put myself to sleep.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.757
Where did you go?

41:50.132 --> 41:52.176
You cannot escape me.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.554
I know it's here somewhere.
Aunt Hilda uses it when she can't sleep.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.805
Where is it?

41:58.224 --> 42:00.309
-Foxglove! Got it.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.772
Of course. I know, too much will kill me.
So, I'll just take the right amount.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.399
Here, kitty, kitty...

42:10.486 --> 42:15.533
Naughty, naughty girl. Where are you?

42:20.538 --> 42:21.789
Where am I hiding?

42:21.997 --> 42:25.834
Well, it's risky, but in plain sight,
and I'm gonna need your help, Salem.

42:33.175 --> 42:36.637
Naughty girl, you should be in bed.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.270
Oh, you can run,

42:44.687 --> 42:47.773
but you cannot escape me.

42:53.028 --> 42:56.073
"A gin-clear mind, self-induced sleep,
and clear intent."

42:58.242 --> 42:59.285
Here goes.

43:10.212 --> 43:11.714
Two minutes exactly.

43:21.724 --> 43:22.683
Aunt Zelda!

43:23.642 --> 43:24.893
Sabrina!

43:25.477 --> 43:28.105
I was always so cruel to her!

43:28.814 --> 43:31.275
-Now she's gone.
-Who's gone?

43:33.152 --> 43:34.528
I killed her.

43:37.573 --> 43:40.534
And now, she's never coming back.

43:40.868 --> 43:43.621
Aunt Zelda, you're in a nightmare.
None of this is real.

43:43.704 --> 43:46.498
Hilda is alive and sleeping next to you,
I promise.

43:46.832 --> 43:50.419
But I don't have much time and I need your
help. There's a sleep demon in our house.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.171
She's the one
who put you in this nightmare,

43:52.254 --> 43:53.922
and I need you to tell me
how to defeat her.

43:54.214 --> 43:55.966
My only sister...

43:57.301 --> 44:00.929
...and I treated her like hell-rot.

44:02.723 --> 44:03.682
Aunt Hilda.

44:04.099 --> 44:07.311
I'm sorry, Aunt Zee, I have to leave you.
But this will all be over soon.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.817
-Aunt Hilda! What has she done to you?

44:13.901 --> 44:16.278
Sabrina, you have to cut me free.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.905
Aunt Hilda, this is a dream.

44:17.988 --> 44:20.658
The sleep demon, this is her doing,
she's torturing you.

44:20.741 --> 44:21.909
-Sleep demon?
-Yes.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.286
Batibat, and I have about 30 seconds
before I wake up.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.288
Do you know what I can do to stop her?

44:26.372 --> 44:29.208
A demon? Uh... Uh...

44:29.416 --> 44:33.045
She's the embodiment of nightmares,
isn't she, Batibat?

44:33.379 --> 44:36.840
Sabrina, you have to be clever,
you have to trap her.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.258
How

44:38.342 --> 44:41.679
I can't-- Uh--
Yes, Sabrina.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.932
What is a nightmare, but a dream gone bad?

44:45.015 --> 44:46.725
A dream gone sour?

44:46.809 --> 44:50.771
You have to trap a nightmare
the same way you trap a dream.

44:51.021 --> 44:53.607
Ooh, my familiars can help.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.692
Your spiders?

44:55.567 --> 44:57.695
-Of course.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.154
Don't leave me with her!

45:02.700 --> 45:04.702
-Ambrose!
-Cousin?

45:04.785 --> 45:07.496
There's a sleep demon named Batibat
on the loose in the house.

45:07.579 --> 45:10.749
-You're dreaming this.
-I am?

45:10.833 --> 45:13.293
Yes, but I have a plan
and you're gonna help me.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.421
Tell me what to do. Shut up, you.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.256
Distract her. Keep her occupied.

45:17.339 --> 45:18.632
The sleep demon?

45:26.890 --> 45:30.853
There are only so many halls,
only so many doors.

45:37.443 --> 45:38.527
Beg, girl.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.739
Beg for Batibat's mercy.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.496
She put a glamor on the cat?

45:50.038 --> 45:51.415
Demon, I'll talk!

45:51.498 --> 45:54.251
I will tell you the spell
that unseals the house,

45:54.334 --> 45:58.172
but, please, end this torment.

46:06.096 --> 46:11.185
Speak, child, and we will both be free.

46:13.061 --> 46:15.147
Come closer, demon. I'm...

46:15.981 --> 46:17.065
I'm so weak.

46:17.900 --> 46:18.901
Closer.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.196
The spell, it's complicated.

46:22.279 --> 46:23.405
Very ancient.

46:24.072 --> 46:24.990
Sumerian.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.910
-Ostrogoth.
-How do I break it?

46:27.993 --> 46:30.496
You have to chant.

46:30.579 --> 46:31.580
Standing on one leg.

46:31.663 --> 46:34.041
-Waving your hands in--
-Enough!

46:36.502 --> 46:37.336
Wait.

46:38.337 --> 46:39.338
What are you doing?

46:39.838 --> 46:42.883
Silly demon. I'm distracting you
while my cousin escapes.

46:43.342 --> 46:46.470
No!

46:51.600 --> 46:54.102
Spellman.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.898
Where are you?

47:08.033 --> 47:11.495
Here, little girl.

47:22.714 --> 47:24.299
Oh, Sabrina.

47:26.468 --> 47:27.886
Oh, child.

47:29.888 --> 47:32.015
This little game has come to an end.

47:38.689 --> 47:41.275
You think those spiders can save you?

47:42.943 --> 47:46.196
Not even the Dark Lord can save you.

47:46.780 --> 47:48.949
Aunt Zelda, whatever you're about to do,
do it fast.

47:50.158 --> 47:53.829
Turpis et infernis in terris pariunt.

47:54.037 --> 47:57.666
Turpis et infernis in terris pariunt.

47:57.833 --> 48:01.503
Et furantur verba haec locutus

48:01.587 --> 48:03.255
sum vobis Laetitia.

48:03.338 --> 48:07.551
Punctum baculus parit malediction.

48:07.634 --> 48:11.680
Adiuro vos tamen hoc graecas munus.

48:13.932 --> 48:16.435
Dream catchers don't trap dreams, Batibat.

48:17.185 --> 48:18.395
They trap nightmares.

48:19.396 --> 48:23.400
Sometimes the oldest,
simplest magic works best.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.969
I just had the most vivid dream.

48:51.428 --> 48:52.554
Yes, so did I.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.265
Sabrina!

49:02.272 --> 49:05.067
Not as intricate
as an Acheron Configuration,

49:05.150 --> 49:07.486
but a jam jar will do just as well.

49:08.528 --> 49:11.531
-How does it feel now?
-Better, Auntie Hilda.

49:24.544 --> 49:25.629
I, um...

49:29.341 --> 49:31.885
I owe you an apology, Sabrina.

49:32.719 --> 49:37.057
When you came to me, in my dream,
I was... lily-livered.

49:37.641 --> 49:39.476
Hysterical. Cowardly.

49:40.310 --> 49:43.438
Only in the dream, Aunt Zelda.

49:43.647 --> 49:46.274
Only in that terrible dream.

49:48.360 --> 49:49.820
So you...

49:50.988 --> 49:54.241
walked through
all of our dreams, then?

49:55.450 --> 49:56.284
I did.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.582
But I can...

50:03.709 --> 50:05.961
barely remember it, it's all so fuzzy.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.922
So fuzzy.

50:34.281 --> 50:35.115
Hello?

50:36.283 --> 50:37.951
Harvey, it's me.

50:38.493 --> 50:39.369
Sabrina?

50:40.037 --> 50:41.705
What time is it?

50:42.164 --> 50:46.126
It's super late,
but I need to ask you something.

50:50.505 --> 50:52.883
You'd never hurt me, would you?

50:53.800 --> 50:55.218
What? No, of course not.

50:56.678 --> 50:59.181
Where-- Where is this coming from?

50:59.264 --> 51:01.016
We're just...

51:02.392 --> 51:04.895
so different, the two of us.

51:05.771 --> 51:09.274
What are you talking about

51:10.025 --> 51:11.318
Nothing, no. I had a...

51:12.527 --> 51:14.696
really bad dream, that's all.

51:15.197 --> 51:16.573
I'll see you at school tomorrow?

51:16.656 --> 51:18.992
Yeah, sure. We've got Civics first, right?

51:19.326 --> 51:20.368
With Ms. Wardwell?

51:33.673 --> 51:34.800
Sabrina.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.134
Why...

51:37.219 --> 51:39.638
It's the middle of the night.
What can I do for you?

51:39.721 --> 51:41.807
You can start by telling me the truth...

51:43.016 --> 51:47.062
about who and what you are.

51:54.569 --> 51:55.987
You'd better sit down, then.

53:09.144 --> 53:10.562
Brett, move your head.
