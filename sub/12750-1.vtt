01:57.484 --> 01:58.792
Shit.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.805
Okay. Humidity levels are good.
Still need thermal and infrared, though.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.670
Where are those guys?

02:12.265 --> 02:13.335
Cut it out.

02:59.513 --> 03:03.393
Day one of our experiment into the limit
of anomalistic psychology.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.757
We're attempting our own high-tech
version of the Charles Experiment.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.026
Unlike the scientific sÃ©ance
from the 1970s...

03:10.190 --> 03:13.433
...our goal is to manifest the spirit
into our world.

03:14.428 --> 03:17.432
- Where'd you get that?
- I made it up in Engineering.

03:17.597 --> 03:21.773
I thought a 3D representation of Charles
would help us focus our focus.

03:21.935 --> 03:26.111
If we pull this off,
we'll prove that ghosts, entities...

03:26.273 --> 03:28.583
...and the supernatural do exist...

03:28.742 --> 03:31.951
...with mass iteration of channeled,
intentional belief.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.806
You think EEG amps and
headbands will make a difference?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.143
Yes.

04:01.308 --> 04:05.620
Instead of just you, me, and Lydia,
it'll be like there's 500 of us.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.552
Stop talking, Greg. Concentrate.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.078
- Whoa.
- Give me a break. You kicked the table.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.511
I did not, I swear.

04:37.844 --> 04:40.518
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, he got it. Now shut up.

05:14.714 --> 05:15.818
Patrick.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.029
Holy shit!

05:29.729 --> 05:31.504
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.081
Lydia! Lydia! Come on!

05:42.809 --> 05:43.879
Shit.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.383
- What is that?
- Where's the flashlight?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.491
What the hell is that? Aah! Patrick!

05:48.648 --> 05:49.888
- Lydia!
- Lydia?

05:52.319 --> 05:54.492
- Aah!
- Lydia!

06:28.054 --> 06:29.124
Hi.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.098
Now no biting.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.042
Hey, you.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.651
<i>Is your car out of the shop yet?</i>

06:47.807 --> 06:50.913
Of course not.
You think you can rescue me again?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.147
<i>Why not?</i>

06:52.312 --> 06:54.656
Kind of like being the hero. I love you.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.259
Me too.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.826
Let's try to get it right this time.

07:02.455 --> 07:04.492
Uh, no problem.

07:17.737 --> 07:18.772
Hey, stranger.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.515
You hungry?

07:20.740 --> 07:22.811
It depends what you're in the mood for.

07:23.810 --> 07:28.190
The last four days we've covered
China, India, Vietnam...

07:28.949 --> 07:30.189
...Ethiopia.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.528
Okay. You choose.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.695
What exotic land
do you wanna visit tonight?

07:43.863 --> 07:46.002
Can we go to Costco after this?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.673
I wanna get a giant saguaro
for the front yard.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.872
What the hell is a saguaro?

07:51.438 --> 07:53.042
It's a cactus.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.449
You think they even have them?

07:55.775 --> 07:57.777
Mm. I mean, you would think so.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.884
You don't think so?

08:01.181 --> 08:04.390
How are you gonna fit a giant saguaro
in the back of your car?

08:06.219 --> 08:07.562
What was that for?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.562
You get happy and be nice.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.828
- I had a bad day at work, all right?
- So?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.164
Get over it.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.067
Would you quit it?

08:20.900 --> 08:21.970
Okay.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.242
So I guess I'm buying you a cactus.

08:30.577 --> 08:32.886
I could always work here
if things don't work out.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.081
Oh, stop it.

08:34.246 --> 08:37.592
You can do that techie thing for a while.
It's not gonna kill you.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.095
At least you're not picking up dog poop.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.592
Hey, look.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.591
What do we need that for?

08:46.259 --> 08:47.761
Could come in handy.

08:47.927 --> 08:51.101
We'll use it once,
then it's gonna end up in the garage.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.106
You can't have a problem with this.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.773
It's cute, it's cheap,
super low-maintenance.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.612
Just like you.

09:05.512 --> 09:07.583
Hmm. Look where we are.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.790
Not the camping thing again. I...

09:09.949 --> 09:12.452
Before my dad first took me,
I thought I'd hate it.

09:12.619 --> 09:16.465
I like the outdoors, but sleeping
in a tent on the ground...

09:17.457 --> 09:19.130
Who said anything about sleeping?

09:34.074 --> 09:38.147
When you were a little girl, I bet your
dream was to live in Palmdale, wasn't it?

09:38.978 --> 09:40.321
Of course.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.324
Abandoned neighborhoods,
vacant strip malls...

09:43.483 --> 09:47.090
...empty desert for miles
in every direction.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.823
What girl doesn't dream about that?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.303
- Who was that?
- Work.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.838
- Hi, neighbors.
- Hey.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.507
How's the unpacking going?

10:40.673 --> 10:43.051
Well, we're getting there, sort of.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.717
Hey, Pepper. Come on, girl. Pepper.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.549
Watch out for this one.
She likes to roam.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.323
How are you, Miss Maggie?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.519
Good.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.165
- This is my boyfriend, Ben.
- Good to meet you, Ben.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.391
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.502
- See you guys soon?
- Yeah, see you soon.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.830
All right, come on.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.997
When did you find time to start
the welcoming committee?

11:03.163 --> 11:06.474
Well, it wasn't that hard,
considering they're our only neighbors.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.248
Hey, Mom.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.086
Um, I'm watching your video right now.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.854
- Uh-huh.
- Damn it! Where is it?

11:28.021 --> 11:30.194
That was Ben. He can't find something.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.262
Yes, Mom, were excellent tenants.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.566
We're taking good care
of your investment home.

11:36.729 --> 11:39.005
Your parents should be happy
they found renters...

11:39.165 --> 11:41.372
...especially responsible ones like us.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.942
We're still settling in...

11:44.103 --> 11:47.243
...but I got new curtains for the bedroom
and I ordered a...

11:51.544 --> 11:52.614
Oh, son of a bitch!

11:53.079 --> 11:55.753
You know what, I gotta go.
Give Dad a kiss?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.456
Okay. I love you too.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.571
My cactus. It's dead.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.967
So we'll return it.

12:09.128 --> 12:13.133
No, it cost four dollars and we'd spend
twice that much just taking it back.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.141
<i>Fight!</i>

12:20.473 --> 12:23.386
I am schooling you right now.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.319
<i>- It ain't over yet.</i>
- Stop.

12:27.947 --> 12:28.982
Stop.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.655
<i>- K.O.!</i>
- Ugh!

12:31.818 --> 12:32.990
Yes! Ha, ha.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.831
Ugh! I need a beer.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.496
Why don't you get me one? Loser.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.682
Armed.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.191
Did you burn something?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.189
Oh, right, because I cook so often.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.866
But you noticed it...

13:12.325 --> 13:13.998
...you clean it.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.195
Thank you.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.515
Ben.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.215
Ben.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.257
- Wake up.
- What?

14:09.215 --> 14:11.889
- Let me fall asleep? I missed the ending.
- Shh.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.187
What's the matter?

14:24.430 --> 14:26.239
Why are the doors open?

14:26.833 --> 14:28.244
I don't know.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.797
Did you set the alarm?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.100
You watched me set it.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.696
I'm gonna look around.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.200
I'm calling the security company.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.701
Okay.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.040
Good night. Thanks again.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.549
<i>No sign of forced entry.
The alarm's working fine.</i>

16:13.706 --> 16:16.778
They said some kids have been
messing around the empty homes.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.719
It's probably just a stupid prank.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.787
We're changing the locks.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.483
- Up, sleepyhead. Come on, I need the sheets.
- Oh...

16:53.646 --> 16:56.320
- Kelly. Come here. Come here.
- Ha, ha.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.663
What time is it?

17:02.822 --> 17:05.996
Nine. The hardware store opens at eight.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.673
New deadbolts, remember?

17:09.829 --> 17:12.207
Yeah. Yeah, <i>yeah,</i> yeah.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.111
Did you get any sleep?

17:16.269 --> 17:17.873
A little.

17:25.944 --> 17:27.856
We're out of toothpaste.

17:28.114 --> 17:30.185
Yeah, we need a lot of things.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.456
You know what, can you make a...

17:37.290 --> 17:38.360
What?

17:42.595 --> 17:43.630
What?

17:44.530 --> 17:46.032
Finish your sentence.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.643
Oh, a list.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.172
What's shaking?

18:16.662 --> 18:20.007
Ah, just installing some
new security cameras.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.341
All the locks are changed too.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.339
You're pretty great, you know that?

18:25.304 --> 18:26.977
You finally noticed?

19:12.218 --> 19:17.190
- I really tweaked my back.
- Okay. All right, Dr. Mason.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.565
Hey, don't jinx me. I'm not a vet yet.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.637
You will be.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.674
Now, if you can lose this top,
we can get started.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.579
Ah, take a look. We have a visitor.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.488
Pepper, come.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.558
Pepper!

19:44.817 --> 19:46.228
Pepper!

19:51.090 --> 19:52.763
Let's go.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.423
What could've happened to her?

20:17.583 --> 20:20.757
Oh, my God, she's barely breathing.
Let's get her some help.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.980
Mike, I'm so sorry.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.484
We tried to help her, but...

20:43.642 --> 20:47.089
I appreciate everything you've done.
There's nothing more you can do.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.658
Look at this.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.693
The linoleum's cracked.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.349
Watch out for spiders.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.249
Thanks.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.724
What the hell?

23:28.774 --> 23:30.219
Ben?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.048
Ben?

23:34.146 --> 23:35.216
Ben?

23:50.996 --> 23:52.168
Did you find anyone?

23:52.932 --> 23:57.677
So far, none of the mold inspectors
can come by for at least a week.

23:57.836 --> 24:01.682
Great. I'm gonna wash up.
You wanna go first?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.444
I'm gonna keep searching.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.390
<i>We're attempting
to contain and entrap the entity...</i>

25:55.554 --> 25:56.965
<i>...we manifested a few years ago.</i>

25:57.122 --> 25:59.261
<i>This is where our experiment
will be happening.</i>

25:59.792 --> 26:03.467
<i>We'll use these devices to detect our
entity when he makes his appearance.</i>

26:04.863 --> 26:07.366
<i>The four of us will be
wearing these headsets.</i>

26:07.633 --> 26:11.137
<i>They'll capture our belief
and channel it into here.</i>

26:11.603 --> 26:15.574
<i>Utilizing our equipment, I'm going to
amplify the brainwaves of the participants.</i>

26:15.741 --> 26:18.085
<i>There'll be four people
sitting around the table...</i>

26:18.243 --> 26:20.723
<i>...but this will make it seem like
four thousand.</i>

26:20.879 --> 26:24.292
<i>And all of this concentrated energy
will be focused into there.</i>

26:24.616 --> 26:29.463
<i>My modern and altered version of
a psychomanteum, or apparition chamber.</i>

26:30.489 --> 26:34.232
<i>The electric current acts as an amplifier
as it runs through the cages.</i>

26:35.260 --> 26:37.672
<i>Entities manifest themselves
through energy.</i>

26:37.830 --> 26:40.811
<i>The greater the energy,
the greater the chance of manifestation.</i>

26:40.966 --> 26:42.673
<i>We miscalculated the first time...</i>

26:42.835 --> 26:46.078
<i>...but now we'll be able to trap the spirit
within the psychomanteum.</i>

26:52.478 --> 26:53.513
<i>Greg!</i>

26:56.982 --> 27:00.020
<i>Greg? Greg? Greg, where are you?</i>

27:01.787 --> 27:04.290
<i>Greg! Greg!</i>

27:23.008 --> 27:25.545
<i>Our effort to entrap it has failed.</i>

27:26.011 --> 27:29.515
<i>I'm not sure what we've done,
but something came through.</i>

27:29.681 --> 27:34.357
<i>We've brought it into our world.
Now it's loose. It's free.</i>

28:03.348 --> 28:05.089
<i>We should never have done this.</i>

28:05.250 --> 28:06.661
Ben?

28:06.818 --> 28:07.853
Yeah?

29:16.655 --> 29:18.430
What?

30:04.269 --> 30:06.681
Ben, maybe we should
just call the cops.

31:04.429 --> 31:06.739
Where are you going?
We can't just abandon our house.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.536
- Yes, we can!
- You're not even dressed!

31:08.700 --> 31:11.544
There is no way I'm staying
in this house tonight!

31:14.873 --> 31:18.582
If it were a person, we would have seen
them come in on the security cameras.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.223
I must have left a blind spot.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.118
Why aren't we saying
what we're both thinking?

31:22.280 --> 31:26.626
Kel. Our house is too new to be haunted.
It has no history.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.123
Those hangers. What could do that?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.528
And those voices.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.605
There's gotta be an explanation.

31:37.763 --> 31:41.609
Hey, at least you finally got me camping.

31:44.636 --> 31:45.979
Promise you'll stay awake?

31:46.772 --> 31:48.445
Promise.

31:49.274 --> 31:50.412
All night?

31:50.575 --> 31:51.883
All night.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.715
Hey! Listen.

35:45.877 --> 35:48.380
I know last night was rough.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.656
Everything is gonna be okay.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.829
Houses make weird noises.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.521
Maybe some animal got inside.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.724
I'm gonna stay home today, I'll clean up...

35:57.889 --> 36:00.392
...call someone to check out the closet.

36:00.558 --> 36:01.866
And then what?

36:02.394 --> 36:03.805
Do you wanna leave?

36:07.565 --> 36:09.044
No.

36:10.068 --> 36:13.311
My parents are counting on us
to look after their place.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.350
I can't tell them their house is haunted.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.684
Have a great day at work.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.025
If anything else happens...

36:25.183 --> 36:26.719
...I'll get us a hotel.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.523
I promise.

40:37.335 --> 40:38.439
Hey, neighbors.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.176
Maggie, I'm so sorry about Pepper.

40:44.342 --> 40:47.516
But this little guy really needs
a good home, so...

40:47.679 --> 40:49.659
...I thought of you.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.851
- Can I?
- Yeah, I don't see why not.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.353
- You didn't have to.
- No, I...

40:55.520 --> 40:57.022
I did.

40:58.656 --> 41:01.933
Have you noticed anything weird
happening in your house lately?

41:02.093 --> 41:03.299
Such as?

41:03.461 --> 41:07.705
Lights going on and off,
doors opening by themselves, molds?

41:07.865 --> 41:09.708
Sounds like shoddy construction.

41:09.867 --> 41:12.040
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

41:12.203 --> 41:13.375
We have the same builder.

41:15.540 --> 41:18.680
And do you mind just letting me know
if anything happens?

41:18.843 --> 41:21.221
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.835
Maggie! You scared me.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.868
Your house killed my dog.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.735
<i>Okay. Humidity levels are good.</i>

43:20.898 --> 43:23.674
<i>Still need thermal and infrared, though.
Where are those guys?</i>

43:24.502 --> 43:25.606
<i>Cut it out.</i>

43:29.507 --> 43:31.851
<i>- Are peripherals online and ready?</i>
<i>- All set.</i>

43:32.009 --> 43:34.853
<i>All right. Let's light this candle.</i>

44:12.717 --> 44:14.321
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Shit!</i>

44:18.022 --> 44:21.401
<i>Lydia, come on. Lydia, come on!</i>

44:25.696 --> 44:28.233
<i>- Where's the flashlight?</i>
<i>- What the hell is that?</i>

44:28.399 --> 44:29.673
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Lydia!</i>

44:35.873 --> 44:37.580
<i>Lydia! Lydia!</i>

44:37.975 --> 44:40.922
<i>Oh, my God. Shut that thing off!</i>

44:41.078 --> 44:43.058
<i>I said, shut that thing off!</i>

45:16.113 --> 45:17.456
I can explain.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.593
This girl, Lydia?

45:23.854 --> 45:25.959
You two were together?

45:27.258 --> 45:29.795
Not the way you and I are, but...

45:31.596 --> 45:32.939
...yes.

45:33.097 --> 45:35.099
What happened to her?

45:36.267 --> 45:37.769
She's, um...

45:41.372 --> 45:42.476
Gone.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.983
"Gone"?

45:44.809 --> 45:46.811
What does that mean, "gone"?

45:46.978 --> 45:48.616
Like she's dead?

45:48.779 --> 45:51.259
- Is that what will happen to me?
- Nothing will happen.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.554
How do you know that?
How can I trust you?

45:53.751 --> 45:58.131
- What is this? What is in my house?
- I honestly don't know, okay?

45:59.657 --> 46:02.331
We were trying to contact something
from the other side.

46:02.493 --> 46:04.996
We were in college,
it was just an experiment.

46:05.162 --> 46:07.164
Why didn't you tell me about this?

46:07.331 --> 46:10.437
You knew what was happening
and you didn't tell me!

46:10.601 --> 46:13.844
I mean, I don't know,
maybe I'm part of this experiment too.

46:14.005 --> 46:15.746
No. This is all in the past.

46:15.906 --> 46:18.352
I thought if you didn't know about it,
you'd be safe.

46:18.509 --> 46:23.515
In my own way, I was trying to protect you.

46:24.582 --> 46:26.186
I'm sorry.

46:26.350 --> 46:29.524
How am I supposed to believe
anything you say?

46:29.687 --> 46:31.689
Get out of my house!

46:35.860 --> 46:37.862
Get out now!

47:01.552 --> 47:03.190
Patrick.

47:05.389 --> 47:07.062
It's Ben.

47:08.225 --> 47:09.568
Call me.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.758
What are you?

49:40.277 --> 49:41.984
- Get off me!
- Stop! Look at me!

49:42.313 --> 49:45.726
Stop! Stop! Look at me!

49:54.158 --> 49:56.365
Still no answer from Patrick.

50:03.901 --> 50:05.574
We're safe now.

50:10.074 --> 50:11.348
What else can I do?

50:13.410 --> 50:15.515
You can get off the bed.

52:22.539 --> 52:24.314
Kelly!

52:31.115 --> 52:32.219
Come on!

52:50.401 --> 52:53.211
It's okay. It's okay.

53:01.245 --> 53:02.849
Where are we going?

53:15.192 --> 53:16.762
It's Patrick.

53:25.936 --> 53:28.780
Your house isn't haunted. You are.

53:30.507 --> 53:32.180
By the ghost we contacted.

53:32.342 --> 53:34.913
If it is a ghost, it's not the ghost
of anything human.

53:35.079 --> 53:36.285
What does it want from us?

53:37.114 --> 53:38.957
Exactly what it's getting.

53:39.116 --> 53:43.189
It wants to be in our world.
It wants us. It feeds on life.

53:43.353 --> 53:47.301
It'll punish you, it'll manipulate the way
you see the world, and it takes you.

53:47.458 --> 53:49.301
We opened the door and it came through.

53:50.394 --> 53:51.873
What door?

53:52.396 --> 53:54.967
A rift between our world and theirs.

53:55.132 --> 53:57.806
Our second session opened it more.

53:59.803 --> 54:01.476
What the hell were you thinking?

54:01.972 --> 54:04.919
Yeah, at least I didn't run away,
act like it never happened.

54:05.075 --> 54:08.147
- That's not what I did and you know it.
- We tried something new.

54:08.312 --> 54:10.155
We tried to contain it.

54:11.648 --> 54:13.650
Remember the psychomanteum?

54:13.817 --> 54:16.957
I've rerouted the current <i>so</i> it gives off
a negative magnetic field.

54:17.121 --> 54:18.828
Like a bomb shelter for brain waves.

54:19.456 --> 54:21.299
I've been living in there for weeks.

54:21.458 --> 54:23.267
That's perfect.

54:23.427 --> 54:26.431
The only way to protect ourselves
is to live in a box.

54:34.671 --> 54:36.617
We still have a chance to end it here.

54:39.810 --> 54:40.982
How?

54:43.680 --> 54:46.627
Place these transmitters
everywhere you saw it try to manifest.

54:46.784 --> 54:48.525
Anywhere it's tried to get a foothold.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.860
I recorded the EEG emissions
of our experiment.

54:55.025 --> 54:57.198
We're gonna use that power against it.

54:57.494 --> 54:59.838
We'll play the recording
of the session in reverse.

54:59.997 --> 55:03.501
I'm gonna tap into the power lines
and feed all that energy into our system.

55:03.667 --> 55:07.205
Four thousand minds put this together.
Four hundred thousand can destroy it.

55:21.652 --> 55:24.724
Instead of aiming the transmitters in,
we aim them at us...

55:25.522 --> 55:27.695
...and the house too.

55:27.858 --> 55:30.361
With us inside, we flood every inch.

55:30.527 --> 55:31.699
Open everything, right?

55:31.862 --> 55:34.502
The fridge, the microwave,
the dishwasher, everything.

55:39.870 --> 55:43.716
In the first experiment, our amplified
EEG-is, they acted like a key.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.680
In the second, we opened a gateway.

55:47.044 --> 55:50.025
We can reverse this process. If we can
link the two recordings, we can...

55:50.180 --> 55:53.889
Amplify and transmit the EEGs in reverse.

55:54.051 --> 55:58.261
And with all the additional power,
we shut the door and we turn the lock.

56:05.329 --> 56:06.364
Okay.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.343
Ben! Ben, help me!

57:23.273 --> 57:24.308
Ben!

57:25.609 --> 57:27.111
Ben!

57:27.778 --> 57:30.349
Ben! Ben, help me!

57:52.970 --> 57:54.176
Ben!

57:54.805 --> 57:56.045
Ben! Ben!

57:57.641 --> 57:58.813
Ben!

57:59.376 --> 58:01.879
Ben! Ben, help me!

58:02.646 --> 58:03.716
Move back!

58:29.473 --> 58:31.851
EEG transmitters linking.

58:42.586 --> 58:44.361
Initiating reverse playback.

59:02.572 --> 59:04.552
Linking process complete.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.278
Amplifying transmitter feed.

59:27.798 --> 59:30.972
EMF readings are high.
Tapping into the main grid.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.491
Did it work?

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:50.556
It's a really quiet neighborhood.
It's about 3400 square feet.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.902
Here's directions to my house.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:14.545
The safe room. Just in case.

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:16.382
Thanks.

01:01:16.907 --> 01:01:20.081
- I'm gonna take this out.
- I'll help you with that.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.785
Two days and nothing freaky at all.

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.789
We got a life again, right?

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:00.587
One day at a time.

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.627
I'll take that.

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:56.181
Don't ever say that, ever.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.750
Patrick!

01:03:07.083 --> 01:03:08.653
Patrick!

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.234
Patrick's gone.

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:48.785
We gotta go to Patrick's.

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:51.626
He lived in that thing you guys built,
that chamber.

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:57.371
Patrick said he built it to keep
this thing out. We'll be safe there.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:58.762
Then what?

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.431
I don't know! But I'm not giving up.

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.598
<i>The lack of pattern...</i>

01:05:59.756 --> 01:06:01.531
<i>...leads me to believe
it's toying with us.</i>

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:05.104
<i>It toyed with the members of the '70s
sÃ©ance and it's toying with Greg and I.</i>

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:08.765
<i>Of the six people who performed
the '70s experiment, two died...</i>

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:11.879
<i>...one committed suicide
and three went missing.</i>

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.839
<i>I didn't tell Ben or the others.
I couldn't.</i>

01:06:15.705 --> 01:06:19.482
<i>This knowledge might have tainted
our results. But now I see I was wrong.</i>

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:23.055
<i>This thing is older than
any demon or ghost.</i>

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.454
<i>It's been trapped in purgatory
for an eternity.</i>

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:28.391
<i>But I believe that purgatory
contains not just human souls...</i>

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:31.327
<i>...but countless entities
and malevolent spirits.</i>

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.701
<i>I've done my best
to figure out what this is...</i>

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:36.064
<i>...but from what I can tell,
it doesn't have a name.</i>

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.570
<i>I've tried to understand
its attack pattern...</i>

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:40.730
<i>...a logic that I can use
for our benefit...</i>

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:42.137
Patrick's journals.

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:43.402
<i>...there is none.</i>

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.568
<i>And that scares me to death.</i>

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:49.679
<i>For the whole of human existence,
people have believed in the supernatural.</i>

01:06:49.873 --> 01:06:53.320
<i>Ghosts and spirits. Angels and demons.</i>

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.012
<i>What we will prove...</i>

01:06:55.178 --> 01:06:58.250
<i>...is that the supernatural is actually
part of the natural world.</i>

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.917
<i>It is something you can
quantify and qualify.</i>

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:03.655
<i>It isn't magic, it is science.</i>

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.595
<i>And we will make contact.</i>

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:09.362
<i>The human body is essentially
a walking battery full of bio-energy...</i>

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:11.938
<i>...particularly that which is
generated by the brain.</i>

01:07:58.975 --> 01:08:00.283
Ben, please. How long...

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:27.339
Kelly.

01:09:28.064 --> 01:09:32.410
<i>The first sounds acted as
a beacon, drawing the entity to our world.</i>

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.341
<i>Then we allowed it to cross over.</i>

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:39.919
<i>It's clear to me that it wants what it doesn't have.
It wants to exist in our plane.</i>

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:45.089
<i>It's getting stronger.
With each person it takes, it gets smarter.</i>

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:48.087
<i>More powerful. It's learning about us.</i>

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:52.759
<i>We cannot tell what is real
and what is our imagination.</i>

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.559
<i>We believed we were studying this entity...</i>

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.233
<i>...but this whole time,
it's been studying us...</i>

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:02.103
<i>...testing our defenses,
our weaknesses.</i>

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.109
<i>This is but the first of them.
They are entering our world.</i>

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:10.276
<i>They are taking life.
We opened the door...</i>

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.714
<i>...and now it's too late to stop it.</i>
- Ben!

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:18.791
<i>It wears you down until you can't
resist any more. And then it takes you.</i>
