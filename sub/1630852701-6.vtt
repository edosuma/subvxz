A NETFLIX SERIES

00:20.041 --> 00:22.583
<i>Yaldabaoth, the first and the last,</i>

00:23.333 --> 00:26.166
<i>I have opened a gateway into the world,</i>

00:26.250 --> 00:29.333
one that you had closed for all eternity.

00:33.750 --> 00:36.041
Lift Sofía's third veil.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.416
Fear not the flesh

00:42.291 --> 00:43.416
and do not love it.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.958
Sacrifice the flesh
that resides in your soul.

00:50.458 --> 00:52.208
Sacrifice your family.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.375
Sacrifice your friends.

01:06.541 --> 01:09.666
You're almost there.
On the brink of perfection.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.208
-Soon you can open the gates to the light.
-Relax.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.541
What just happened?

01:13.625 --> 01:16.541
-Sofía, you must forget.
-Forget what you've just seen.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.416
-Was that real?
-Leave guilt behind. It doesn't exist.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.000
-Was it my fault?
-None of this is real.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.125
Nothing that happens
on this side is real, Sofía.

01:25.958 --> 01:27.125
You're freeing yourself.

01:27.208 --> 01:28.750
-Sofía.
-Stay away!

01:28.833 --> 01:29.875
Don't touch me!

01:42.458 --> 01:44.750
It's still early to say,
but the operation went well.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.958
We'll have to see how he responds.

01:47.041 --> 01:50.541
But fortunately, we haven't
detected any brain damage.

01:51.583 --> 01:54.375
-We'll talk soon.
-Thank you, Doctor.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.083
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:07.291
It's a miracle he's still alive.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.166
Talk to him.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.875
Tell him we're here
and that we don't want him to go.

03:06.958 --> 03:08.375
<i>How much further?</i>

03:08.458 --> 03:10.000
<i>It's already dark.</i>

03:10.083 --> 03:12.333
<i>And I don't like the dark. At all.</i>

03:14.083 --> 03:15.625
<i>Follow me. It's over here.</i>

03:17.041 --> 03:18.125
<i>Are you sure?</i>

03:18.208 --> 03:20.166
<i>I don't get</i>
<i>why we had to leave Cape Ending.</i>

03:20.250 --> 03:23.041
<i>There were really cute guys</i>
<i>in Parker's tavern.</i>

03:23.125 --> 03:24.500
<i>Want me to carry that?</i>

03:25.916 --> 03:27.125
<i>I'm gonna go tinkle.</i>

03:27.625 --> 03:30.916
<i>Why'd you ask my idiot sister</i>
<i>to tag along, Mike?</i>

03:51.625 --> 03:55.041
<i>There's no way my sister</i>
<i>and I share the same DNA.</i>

03:55.125 --> 03:56.333
<i>Don't get mad.</i>

03:56.416 --> 03:58.583
<i>She's already finished</i>
<i>doing her business. Look.</i>

04:00.416 --> 04:01.333
<i>Jennifer?</i>

04:02.333 --> 04:03.166
<i>What?</i>

04:14.583 --> 04:16.958
<i>I was starving!</i>

04:21.208 --> 04:22.666
BLOODY FERIA

04:23.333 --> 04:26.333
A CHISCO VELÁZQUEZ FILM

04:26.416 --> 04:29.208
CAST

04:33.750 --> 04:35.375
I'm in that movie too.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.750
You, me, and half this town.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.250
I don't know how Chisco talked us into it.

04:47.416 --> 04:48.958
He's out of surgery.

04:49.791 --> 04:51.166
They say it went well.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.291
But the kid's in a coma. I don't know if…

05:03.250 --> 05:04.750
Just what we needed.

05:05.791 --> 05:06.875
This sucks.

05:12.416 --> 05:14.916
How's Sofía doing?

05:17.833 --> 05:21.666
She ran off into the woods.
The cops are out looking for her.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.166
She's gonna be fine, okay?

05:29.041 --> 05:30.458
Nothing's gonna be fine.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.125
I turned my dad in.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.666
How will he ever forgive me?
I'm a goddamn monster.

05:39.875 --> 05:40.875
Eva.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.500
Come here.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.041
Lieutenant.

05:56.166 --> 05:57.833
-She still in there?
-Yeah.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.708
Your sister's worried about you.

06:31.416 --> 06:32.416
Sofía.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.000
We have to talk
about the people you met with.

06:36.875 --> 06:37.875
The cult.

06:38.916 --> 06:40.208
Your sister told me.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.541
I know you met with them.

06:50.875 --> 06:52.000
Once.

06:54.583 --> 06:55.708
In the woods.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.208
Just once.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.166
There was this woman.

07:10.791 --> 07:12.458
The one from the photo.

07:14.875 --> 07:15.875
And a man.

07:16.875 --> 07:19.125
He was old, in a wheelchair.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.000
They told me some crazy stuff about

07:24.875 --> 07:26.375
how the world isn't real.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.875
I didn't listen to them.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.541
I don't know what Eva told you.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.458
Don't be too hard on her.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.666
She did what was best for both of you.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.541
Before you say anything,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.875
I know you think
I'm a bitch for turning Dad in.

08:23.125 --> 08:24.750
If only I had faith like yours.

08:25.666 --> 08:29.708
I wish I were sure Dad didn't do
anything wrong, but I don't know.

08:29.791 --> 08:30.791
Eva.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.916
Did you see the look on his face?

08:42.250 --> 08:43.250
He was sad.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.625
How do you think I felt?

08:47.083 --> 08:48.500
Maybe I should've listened to you

08:48.583 --> 08:50.750
and left without
saying anything to the cops.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.083
Eva.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.041
You're convinced I'm better than you.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.291
But… I don't know what to think anymore.

09:05.833 --> 09:07.750
I just make things worse.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.416
With you.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.500
With Chisco.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.250
-If I had been there with him…
-No.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.750
What happened wasn't your fault.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.958
Chisco hasn't been okay since his mom…

09:27.875 --> 09:29.916
Since they found her at the mine.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.833
I was watching his movie.

09:40.541 --> 09:41.708
My acting sucks.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.625
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

09:56.708 --> 09:57.708
Thanks.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.958
Guillén says there are
more cult members in town.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.750
-Sofía met with them in the woods.
-Who are they?

10:11.250 --> 10:12.875
That's what we all want to know.

10:14.291 --> 10:16.000
The lieutenant will fill you in.

10:18.125 --> 10:20.416
Tina, please! You're gonna break it again!

10:20.500 --> 10:23.666
Two weeks and no jackpot.
How do you explain that?

10:23.750 --> 10:25.916
Okay, but don't hit it!

10:26.541 --> 10:30.916
I'll see if I can drop by the hospital.
Guillén has me with Pablo all day long.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.875
-I'll cover for you.
-Thanks.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.625
I got it. My treat.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.333
-I'm heading out.
-See you later.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.875
Why the long face, huh?

10:48.625 --> 10:50.416
Not much to smile about.

10:51.083 --> 10:55.750
Well, with everything going on,
can't we at least be glad we're okay?

10:57.541 --> 11:01.208
You were supposed to be back
half an hour ago. The fridges are empty.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.833
Yeah. Sorry, Mom.

11:02.916 --> 11:05.416
How many times
do I have to tell you to comb your hair?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.500
Leave me alone.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.041
CIVIL GUARD STATION

11:13.583 --> 11:14.666
All right.

11:17.416 --> 11:18.958
What happened on Saint John's Eve?

11:20.833 --> 11:21.833
Need a reminder?

11:24.208 --> 11:28.333
Twenty-three people trusted you and Elena.

11:28.416 --> 11:29.833
And the two of you

11:31.333 --> 11:32.333
killed them.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.833
I know nothing about the cult.

11:35.916 --> 11:38.083
So, you just happened to be there?

11:38.166 --> 11:40.875
-You'll charge me no matter what I say.
-You're right.

11:40.958 --> 11:44.000
I don't need a confession.
I got all the evidence I need.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.083
All right.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.833
I'm listening. Tell me what happened.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.333
On Saint John's Eve, after the girls left,

12:08.833 --> 12:12.166
Elena said she was meeting
some friends at the mine.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.958
She asked me to go with her.

12:16.500 --> 12:20.166
I didn't know who they were…
She'd never mentioned them before.

12:23.166 --> 12:26.833
I think she was having
some kind of nervous breakdown

12:26.916 --> 12:28.666
'cause none of it made sense.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.125
They wanted to go in,
but everyone knows methane is toxic.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.208
Pablo!

12:34.541 --> 12:37.916
-You think I'm an idiot?
-What do you want? A different story?

12:38.416 --> 12:39.291
Whatever.

12:39.375 --> 12:42.583
Now it'll be clear to your girls
that they're on their own

12:42.666 --> 12:44.291
and that their father's an asshole.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.666
My wife is dead.

12:54.416 --> 12:56.958
You're blaming me for all those deaths.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.541
And my daughters…

13:00.833 --> 13:02.833
You don't think all this hurts me?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.791
You just said your wife is dead.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.958
How can you be so sure, Pablo?

13:14.625 --> 13:15.833
Did you see her body?

13:17.083 --> 13:18.083
No.

13:19.041 --> 13:19.875
I didn't.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.041
You're here. That's not a good sign.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.916
What did my father say
that calls for a psychologist?

13:31.500 --> 13:33.708
Don't worry. He's just made a statement.

13:33.791 --> 13:38.666
Yeah, one that's full of lies.
He denies any connection with the cult.

13:39.958 --> 13:41.416
Maybe he didn't have any.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.250
He ID'd this woman.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.541
He saw her at the mine.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.958
The same woman you saw in the woods.

13:55.250 --> 13:58.416
She told him Elena died inside the mine.

13:59.958 --> 14:01.750
Which is what we thought.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.291
So why didn't they find a body?

14:09.416 --> 14:12.375
-When can we talk to him?
-You'll have to wait.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.291
Maybe he'll tell us the truth.

14:14.375 --> 14:17.375
It would be a lot easier
if he and you quit lying.

14:25.666 --> 14:26.750
I'm sorry.

14:26.833 --> 14:27.666
Sofía.

14:28.916 --> 14:31.541
Don't go. It's your house.
We'll tell them to leave.

14:32.416 --> 14:34.708
Sofía, it doesn't matter
what Guillén says.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.958
If Dad wasn't involved,
they'll let him go.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.708
Do you really believe Dad's clueless?

14:38.791 --> 14:40.791
Or is it easier for you to think that now?

14:41.458 --> 14:43.625
Sofía, give him a chance.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.666
Maybe it was just Mom.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.500
Guillén is right.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.875
We're all lying.

14:51.916 --> 14:55.166
Maybe it's time
we faced up to what we've done.

14:56.041 --> 14:59.625
-Chisco is dying!
-What does Chisco have to do with this?

15:00.208 --> 15:02.291
Everyone's too scared
to say what's going on.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.083
Do you know?

15:06.750 --> 15:09.916
Sofía… You need to tell me what you know.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.083
Can't you see
I'm trying to take care of us?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.750
Don't play the martyr, Eva.

15:18.541 --> 15:21.583
All you care about is making yourself
look good to the people in town.

15:22.458 --> 15:24.541
So they don't see you as a leper.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.833
And that has nothing to do with the truth.

15:29.583 --> 15:30.583
You're being cruel.

15:43.833 --> 15:47.333
Guillén's really pissed.
He didn't buy a word of what you said.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.041
I don't care.

15:50.125 --> 15:53.166
-When will the girls be here?
-I don't know.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.083
This wasn't the plan.
I was supposed to get you out of town.

15:57.583 --> 16:00.708
I couldn't yet
because Guillén's been on my ass.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.750
Who else is part of the cult?

16:04.500 --> 16:05.541
In Feria.

16:08.916 --> 16:11.250
Quit fucking around. This is important.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.375
Pablo.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.041
Your girl Sofía's been meeting with them.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.083
What the hell?

16:25.166 --> 16:27.166
Get her out of here. You hear me?

16:27.250 --> 16:28.750
-You promised.
-Let go!

16:28.833 --> 16:30.333
Get them out of here. Got that?

16:30.416 --> 16:32.791
-Who brought you this mattress?
-Who cares?

16:32.875 --> 16:36.416
-Shut up, dammit!
-Don't let them near Sofía, you hear?

16:36.500 --> 16:37.541
Marcos!

17:33.916 --> 17:34.916
<i>I can't help it.</i>

17:36.750 --> 17:37.666
<i>I can't help it.</i>

17:37.750 --> 17:40.208
<i>Isn't this supposed to be a horror movie?</i>

17:41.333 --> 17:43.000
-<i>Mom!</i>
-<i>Didn't I do it right?</i>

17:43.083 --> 17:45.500
<i>-The entire shot.</i>
<i>-Sorry, Chisco.</i>

18:23.416 --> 18:24.541
Stay here.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.000
Candela, what are you doing?

18:32.791 --> 18:34.041
Candela.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.791
-Is she okay, Dad?
-I told you to wait outside.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.125
What's gotten into you?

18:38.208 --> 18:40.916
-I need to go back. Please.
-I can't believe you.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.083
Who's Candela?

18:47.458 --> 18:48.916
Belda will take care of her.

18:49.416 --> 18:50.833
She's the blood.

18:50.916 --> 18:53.625
The sacrifice of the fourth veil.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.541
What if Sofía won't do it?

19:03.208 --> 19:04.916
We'll take her to the temple.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.875
It's healing nicely.
Are you still taking the pills?

19:12.916 --> 19:14.083
When I remember.

19:14.916 --> 19:16.125
Keep it up.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.833
We don't want this happening again, do we?

19:19.541 --> 19:21.416
-All set.
-Thanks.

19:22.583 --> 19:23.583
Off you go.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.666
-Little by little.
-Thanks, Dr. Belda.

19:30.458 --> 19:31.458
Candela.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.291
I'll wait here, Mom.

19:43.083 --> 19:44.416
I heard about your dad.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.416
Sorry.

19:48.583 --> 19:49.750
How's your mom?

19:50.458 --> 19:51.500
Is she okay?

19:51.583 --> 19:52.750
She's a little off.

19:54.791 --> 19:55.791
Yeah, well,

19:56.666 --> 19:57.750
who isn't?

19:58.416 --> 19:59.875
What with Chisco…

20:01.375 --> 20:03.500
They're holding a Mass for him tomorrow.

20:04.750 --> 20:05.750
Yeah.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.250
Like that's gonna do anything.

20:14.791 --> 20:15.791
Anyway.

20:21.541 --> 20:22.500
Mar?

20:24.791 --> 20:29.458
If you're up for it, come over,
and we can stuff our faces with chips.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.166
Belda, I have to go back.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.833
I've never felt as alive as when I was
in the temple, with him inside.

20:40.916 --> 20:42.375
You'll return, Candela.

20:44.125 --> 20:45.166
Very soon.

20:54.541 --> 20:55.916
I've been watching it.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.875
<i>Bloody Feria.</i>

21:05.791 --> 21:07.083
It's so bad.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.958
But we had fun, didn't we?

21:12.125 --> 21:13.250
A lot of laughs.

22:09.333 --> 22:10.333
Is it serious?

22:11.333 --> 22:12.375
Your mom.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.500
It's like her brain broke or something.

22:18.041 --> 22:21.916
She's not the same.
My dad being a dick doesn't help either.

22:25.875 --> 22:29.416
Weren't we supposed to be
the troubled ones? Teenagers.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.541
We stopped being teenagers a while ago.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.333
We can't blame hormones for our craziness.

22:37.583 --> 22:38.833
What about our parents?

22:39.458 --> 22:42.625
What's making them go crazy?
Midlife crisis?

22:43.666 --> 22:46.958
Well, it hit <i>your</i> parents pretty hard.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.125
You're so dumb.

22:51.541 --> 22:54.166
Sorry. It's the beer talking.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.208
All right.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.416
If I go home
smelling like beer and cigarettes,

23:09.916 --> 23:11.208
my dad will crucify me.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.333
Sofía is right.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.750
Enough hiding everything.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.583
Mar, we don't have to be like our parents.

23:40.791 --> 23:43.125
-Eva, they arrested my dad.
-What?

23:43.208 --> 23:44.250
It's nuts, man.

23:44.916 --> 23:48.500
My mom and I came home
to find them searching the bar

23:49.208 --> 23:50.333
and my house.

23:51.208 --> 23:52.666
Why'd they arrest him?

23:54.833 --> 23:56.083
I'll leave you two alone.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.125
I'm sorry.

24:00.833 --> 24:01.833
Raúl.

24:02.958 --> 24:03.958
What happened?

24:08.625 --> 24:09.625
They say

24:10.416 --> 24:12.791
he knew stuff about that goddamn cult.

24:15.708 --> 24:17.125
And that he's involved.

24:26.708 --> 24:29.500
In the courtyard storeroom,
behind some boxes.

24:30.375 --> 24:32.416
Not like you tried too hard to hide them.

24:40.916 --> 24:44.125
Father Ezcaray was keeping a record
of something in these notebooks,

24:44.208 --> 24:47.458
and you took them
when you went into the sacristy.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.708
It's just village gossip.

24:51.250 --> 24:54.083
Ezcaray wrote down
what people said during confession.

24:54.583 --> 24:56.458
-And his own thoughts--
-I read them.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.166
He felt he was a sinner
because he was with Mani.

25:00.833 --> 25:04.916
There you go… I was trying to save
the town from another scandal.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.583
"In the kingdom,
the gods seem to be organized

25:14.666 --> 25:17.750
in a pantheon
over which Yaldabaoth presides."

25:20.166 --> 25:22.750
How was Ezcaray connected to the cult?

25:24.458 --> 25:26.166
I don't know…

25:26.666 --> 25:27.666
Marcos.

25:28.458 --> 25:29.541
Lie to me again…

25:31.875 --> 25:34.916
and I swear I'll find a way
to charge you with the murder.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.958
I don't know. Maybe I'm missing something,

25:42.208 --> 25:44.166
but didn't Sandra already confess?

25:45.625 --> 25:47.166
What deal did you have with Pablo?

25:47.916 --> 25:50.458
Why does he want you
to take his girls away from here?

25:51.416 --> 25:53.791
Who are the cult members still in town?

25:53.875 --> 25:57.291
Do you even care a colleague
is in jail for something she didn't do?

25:58.458 --> 25:59.625
Not gonna talk?

26:04.833 --> 26:07.916
It's your call,
but you know you're gonna pay for it.

26:09.708 --> 26:10.708
Guillén.

26:13.958 --> 26:16.916
It would be a good idea
for Sofía to go to Seville.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.416
Don't tell me what to do, Marcos.

27:03.833 --> 27:05.791
The coffee is terrible.

27:09.083 --> 27:11.416
-What are you doing here?
-Come with me.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.541
Leave me alone, Halid. I'm done with that.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.791
I just want to talk.

27:19.708 --> 27:20.708
Okay?

27:27.625 --> 27:29.291
I don't know what to think.

27:29.916 --> 27:34.416
I'm not going to say anything to the cops
about you guys, but I need some time.

27:35.625 --> 27:38.000
What about your mother?
Did you forget about her?

27:38.083 --> 27:39.416
What if there's nothing else?

27:41.291 --> 27:43.291
What if this is
the only world that exists?

27:44.250 --> 27:45.625
What if my mother's dead?

27:45.708 --> 27:48.458
Hey. No, don't lose faith.
It's the only thing we have left.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.583
It kills me to be with Chisco.

27:51.291 --> 27:54.958
What I feel is real.
Don't you think I'd rather feel nothing?

28:03.166 --> 28:05.250
Free your soul, Sofía.

28:05.833 --> 28:08.583
You're ready for the fourth veil.

28:12.333 --> 28:13.958
Come with me to the temple.

28:17.375 --> 28:18.541
To the sacrifice.

28:19.916 --> 28:22.333
Come to the gates of the light.

28:27.458 --> 28:28.750
Where do you come from?

28:28.833 --> 28:30.375
We are from the light.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.416
Who are you?

28:31.500 --> 28:33.625
We are the children of the light.

28:33.708 --> 28:35.541
We are its chosen ones.

28:35.625 --> 28:38.416
What is the sign of your father in you?

28:38.500 --> 28:42.416
It is a movement and a relief.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.291
Where do you come from?

28:44.375 --> 28:45.916
We are from the light.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.416
Who are you?

28:47.500 --> 28:49.416
We are the children of the light.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.166
We are its chosen ones.

28:51.250 --> 28:53.458
What is the sign of your father in you?

28:53.541 --> 28:55.541
It is a movement

28:56.375 --> 28:58.125
and a relief.

29:04.875 --> 29:07.291
When we strip ourselves of our flesh,

29:08.250 --> 29:10.750
we find ourselves in the relief.

29:15.000 --> 29:18.875
You who preside over
the hidden mysteries of the Supreme Triad

29:19.875 --> 29:22.250
and shine during the night,

29:22.833 --> 29:24.083
Behemoth,

29:24.750 --> 29:26.916
I prepare to enter into your empire…

29:31.750 --> 29:34.416
and create the bond between the light…

29:36.750 --> 29:38.083
and the perfect one.

30:27.333 --> 30:29.333
The fourth veil is now complete.

30:29.833 --> 30:32.541
You are set free
by the blood of the sacrifice.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.833
There is no pain.

30:35.458 --> 30:37.750
There is no guilt. There is no death.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.500
Leave your emotions behind,

30:41.083 --> 30:43.833
and you'll be ready
to open the fifth veil,

30:44.375 --> 30:47.500
to open the gates for the Solitary King.

31:25.416 --> 31:27.083
<i>You came at last.</i>

31:27.583 --> 31:29.000
<i>You don't fool me.</i>

31:29.958 --> 31:31.250
<i>You aren't my sister.</i>

31:32.458 --> 31:34.000
<i>You're a shell.</i>

31:34.083 --> 31:36.166
<i>The green smoke is inside you.</i>

31:36.666 --> 31:38.083
<i>Are you gonna kill me?</i>

31:38.666 --> 31:41.625
<i>In order to save you, I have to kill you!</i>

31:51.333 --> 31:52.583
<i>Jennifer!</i>

31:53.333 --> 31:55.625
<i>I'm sorry, Jennifer!</i>

31:56.333 --> 31:59.750
<i>I had to do it, Jennifer! I'm sorry!</i>

32:00.625 --> 32:03.083
-In the end, I get cured.
-<i>Jennifer!</i>

32:03.166 --> 32:04.500
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

32:04.583 --> 32:07.875
If Chisco had finished the movie,
everyone would've come back to life.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
He liked movies with happy endings.

32:13.916 --> 32:15.833
I know you were
at the hospital until late.

32:17.416 --> 32:19.000
There's a Mass for him today.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.291
What you said yesterday…

32:27.958 --> 32:29.625
you were totally right.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.500
I'm afraid to tell the truth.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.041
Why are you so scared?

32:44.458 --> 32:46.541
They've treated us like crap in Feria.

32:48.416 --> 32:50.500
And I've just been doing what I do best.

32:51.583 --> 32:52.791
Put on my poker face

32:53.458 --> 32:54.333
and smile.

32:54.833 --> 32:57.083
Keep up the perfect girl act.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.416
Raúl came over last night.

33:05.916 --> 33:07.333
His father was arrested.

33:07.958 --> 33:11.541
I don't know how, but he seems
to be connected to the cult.

33:13.708 --> 33:15.208
Raúl was a wreck,

33:16.666 --> 33:18.625
but I couldn't stop thinking about Mar.

33:22.583 --> 33:23.833
Am I a bad person?

33:26.583 --> 33:28.125
You can't say it, can you?

33:33.458 --> 33:35.041
I'm in love with her.

33:39.125 --> 33:40.500
Just what we needed.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.666
The hicks here will burn us
for being a pair of lesbian witches.

33:51.666 --> 33:55.875
A woman in town told Ezcaray
everything he knew about the cult.

33:56.375 --> 33:59.791
Rites in a temple,
some kind of god called Dekta…

34:00.291 --> 34:02.750
I don't really know what I'm looking for.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.166
Are you all right?

34:12.250 --> 34:13.125
Yeah.

34:13.208 --> 34:17.541
I'm too worked up. I was up all night,
staring at this shitty handwriting.

34:18.041 --> 34:19.041
That's all.

34:20.708 --> 34:23.166
The first notebook is from 15 years ago.

34:23.833 --> 34:26.333
Estrella, you know
the people in this town.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.333
Elena and Ezcaray weren't close.
I don't think <i>she</i> told him.

34:30.416 --> 34:34.083
Someone else must've been
in contact with the cult from the start.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.583
Want me to take a stab at it?

34:37.458 --> 34:41.500
I bet I'm missing something
that would help you identify her.

35:08.708 --> 35:13.375
Our mission as a congregation
is to remain united in times of grief.

35:13.458 --> 35:20.041
So, today, the most important thing
is to show all our warmth and support

35:20.125 --> 35:21.250
as a church

35:21.750 --> 35:25.375
for Francisco Carmona
and his father, Pedro.

35:25.875 --> 35:30.416
Today, all our wishes and prayers
go out to this young man,

35:30.500 --> 35:34.500
who acted out of confusion.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.750
God Almighty,

35:38.250 --> 35:43.125
who shelters the sorrowful
and comforts the imprisoned,

35:43.666 --> 35:47.833
hear my affliction
and manifest your power.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.375
Where are you going?

35:50.958 --> 35:52.833
Defeat the detestable enemy

35:53.708 --> 35:56.500
and make it so that

35:56.583 --> 36:00.666
once your adversary is vanqui--
Do you want to say something, my child?

36:01.250 --> 36:02.333
Go ahead.

36:05.541 --> 36:08.208
I'd like to share something
with this congregation.

36:09.916 --> 36:11.916
You all know Chisco is my friend.

36:12.791 --> 36:13.958
My only friend.

36:15.708 --> 36:17.208
You're praying for him now.

36:18.708 --> 36:20.833
But when he was here,
you all laughed at him.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.916
At best, you felt bad for him.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.916
Son of a junkie and a cuckolded father.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.541
-I know you're upset--
-Back off.

36:34.208 --> 36:35.875
Let's drop this fucking act.

36:35.958 --> 36:37.083
Sofía, cut it out.

36:39.125 --> 36:41.166
My sister's shyer than she looks.

36:42.416 --> 36:44.125
But she said it best.

36:56.916 --> 36:58.416
<i>What you said yesterday,</i>

36:58.916 --> 37:00.333
<i>you were totally right.</i>

37:01.291 --> 37:03.000
<i>I'm afraid to tell the truth.</i>

37:04.458 --> 37:05.791
<i>Why are you so scared?</i>

37:06.500 --> 37:08.666
<i>They've treated us like crap in Feria.</i>

37:11.583 --> 37:13.958
<i>And I've just been doing what I do best.</i>

37:14.666 --> 37:16.875
<i>Put on my poker face and smile.</i>

37:16.958 --> 37:19.083
<i>Keep up the perfect girl act.</i>

37:19.166 --> 37:20.458
Sofía, turn that off.

37:21.666 --> 37:24.625
<i>Raúl came over last night.</i>
<i>His father was arrested.</i>

37:25.125 --> 37:29.166
<i>I don't know how, but he seems</i>
<i>to be connected to the cult.</i>

37:30.458 --> 37:32.166
<i>Raúl was a wreck,</i>

37:33.583 --> 37:35.500
<i>but I couldn't stop thinking about Mar.</i>

37:35.583 --> 37:36.833
Sofía, please.

37:38.208 --> 37:40.000
<i>You can't say it, can you?</i>

37:41.208 --> 37:42.666
<i>I'm in love with her.</i>

37:44.916 --> 37:46.291
<i>Just what we needed.</i>

37:47.916 --> 37:51.500
<i>The hicks here will burn us</i>
<i>for being a pair of lesbian witches.</i>

38:00.083 --> 38:02.125
Eva!

38:03.833 --> 38:05.000
What was that?

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Is it true?

38:12.833 --> 38:14.041
Did you say that?

38:16.333 --> 38:18.375
Is it that fucking hard to say "no"?

38:33.208 --> 38:34.500
You goddamn liar.

38:40.291 --> 38:41.500
Sofía!

38:45.250 --> 38:46.458
Where are you going?

38:51.791 --> 38:53.291
What the hell did you do?

38:55.208 --> 38:57.125
What the hell did you do, Sofía?

39:02.000 --> 39:03.291
What did they do to you?

39:03.375 --> 39:04.875
Say whatever you want.

39:05.375 --> 39:06.375
I don't care.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.916
I know I don't have to love you.

39:09.791 --> 39:10.958
You're nothing to me.

39:11.541 --> 39:12.708
You are nothing.

39:13.541 --> 39:15.333
Well, you're everything to me.

39:15.958 --> 39:18.791
I don't care what crazy shit you pull
or what you do to me.

39:19.541 --> 39:20.625
I'm your sister.

39:21.166 --> 39:22.250
I won't abandon you.

39:28.416 --> 39:29.416
Sofía!

39:48.333 --> 39:49.250
Get me out of here.

40:06.041 --> 40:07.041
Is that Mom?

40:12.958 --> 40:13.958
Is she okay?

40:15.958 --> 40:16.833
You're a slut.

40:16.916 --> 40:18.708
-Like your mom.
-Leave the girl alone.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.083
Sure, the poor girl.

40:20.666 --> 40:22.125
You're not gonna change me.

40:22.916 --> 40:24.041
I like Eva.

40:26.208 --> 40:28.000
Come on, don't hold back.

40:28.666 --> 40:29.666
Hit me again.

40:37.583 --> 40:38.708
Are you all right?

40:43.208 --> 40:45.750
Candela, let's go.
You need to see a doctor.

40:48.458 --> 40:49.708
Okay, that's enough.

40:50.208 --> 40:52.708
Show's over. Come on. Let's go.

40:53.916 --> 40:54.833
Come on.

40:54.916 --> 40:55.916
Mom.

40:57.541 --> 40:58.541
Can you hear me?

41:00.541 --> 41:01.708
Cover up a bit.

41:04.291 --> 41:05.833
Do you want to go home?

41:07.750 --> 41:09.208
That's not my home.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.916
And you're not my daughter.

41:16.666 --> 41:18.166
You just need to rest.

41:22.291 --> 41:24.083
Dekta took my womb.

41:26.791 --> 41:29.041
I've never given birth in this world.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.041
You didn't come from me.

42:34.458 --> 42:35.625
Take me to the temple.

42:36.791 --> 42:38.916
Tell Blanca I want
to perform the final veil.

42:40.791 --> 42:42.625
I want to open the gates to the kingdom.

43:07.583 --> 43:09.958
She just went in.
A man with gray hair brought her.

43:10.041 --> 43:12.208
-How many are there?
-Four or five.

43:19.458 --> 43:20.666
Who are they?

43:20.750 --> 43:23.375
Colleagues from Madrid.
I stopped trusting people here.

43:26.208 --> 43:27.208
We're going in.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.833
-Civil Guard!
-Let's go!

43:33.708 --> 43:34.625
Come on!

43:46.250 --> 43:47.375
-Let go!
-Calm down.

43:48.541 --> 43:49.375
-No!
-Enough!

43:49.458 --> 43:50.541
No!

43:50.625 --> 43:52.458
Let me go! I said, let me go!

43:52.958 --> 43:54.375
-Let me go!
-Come on.

43:54.458 --> 43:55.833
No!

43:55.916 --> 43:57.708
-Calm down.
-No!

43:57.791 --> 43:58.958
Let me go!

43:59.041 --> 43:59.958
No!

44:02.583 --> 44:03.583
Let me go!

44:03.666 --> 44:05.041
Let me go, I said!

44:05.125 --> 44:05.958
-Sofía.
-No!

44:06.041 --> 44:07.875
-Sofía.
-No!

44:07.958 --> 44:10.416
Listen to me. Sofía, take it easy.

44:10.500 --> 44:13.625
Okay? Relax. It's going to be okay.

44:14.458 --> 44:15.833
You're not real.

44:17.833 --> 44:20.750
You aren't real!

46:50.833 --> 46:53.750
