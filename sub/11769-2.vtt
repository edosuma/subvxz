01:03.200 --> 01:05.567
IT WAS A WHOLE BIG THING,
I HAD TO...

01:05.600 --> 01:07.700
I GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE
AND I TOLD HER

01:07.733 --> 01:08.800
I'M GOING TO A HOTEL,
DON'T CALL ME.

01:08.833 --> 01:09.933
WOW.

01:09.967 --> 01:11.300

01:15.833 --> 01:18.267
AND JUST A SEPARATION

01:18.300 --> 01:19.933
WELL, I MEAN,
IT WAS A LONG TIME COMING,

01:19.967 --> 01:21.067
AND, YOU KNOW...

01:21.100 --> 01:24.067
YEAH, UM,
MY PROBLEM IS,

01:24.067 --> 01:27.067
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE DIVORCE THING,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

01:27.067 --> 01:30.267
I DON'T WANT HER
TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT ME,

01:30.300 --> 01:31.767
I DON'T WANT THINGS TO
COME OUT IN COURT.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.667
I NEVER BROKE THE LAW,
YOU KNOW, BUT PERSONAL THINGS.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.333
WHAT KIND OF THINGS ?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

01:36.367 --> 01:37.900
LIKE SEXUAL.

01:37.933 --> 01:42.467
YOU KNOW, THERE'S CERTAIN
SEXUAL THINGS THAT I LIKE,

01:42.500 --> 01:45.567
AND I DON'T WANT SUSIE
YAMMERING ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.067
THERE NOT HORRIBLE,
EVIL THINGS,

01:49.067 --> 01:50.667
THEY DON'T INVOLVE ANYTHING
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.667
SHE'S GOT SOME...

01:51.700 --> 01:54.167
YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,
JUST, UM, STUFF...

01:54.200 --> 01:55.433
YOU DON'T WANT
HER TO REPEAT.

01:55.467 --> 01:56.533
I DON'T WANT
HER TO REPEAT.

01:56.567 --> 01:57.567
SO, THAT'S WHY...

01:57.600 --> 01:58.733
THIS IS SEXUAL BLACKMAIL,
WHAT IS THAT ?

01:58.767 --> 02:00.200
SEXUAL BLACKMAIL.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.067
THAT IS JUST AWFUL.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.467
THAT'S, YEAH IT'S...

02:03.500 --> 02:06.700
SEE, THAT'S WHY
I'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
EVEN REMOTELY KINKY.

02:06.733 --> 02:07.833
EVER, WITH ANYONE.

02:07.867 --> 02:09.067
NOTHIN'.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.100
THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE DONE,
I'VE BEEN ON THE BOTTOM.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.400
YOU KNOW, THAT'S IT.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.133
NOT EVEN WITH YOUR WIFE,
NOTHING, LIKE, YOU KNOW...

02:14.167 --> 02:15.833
WELL, LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING
WITH YOUR WIFE.

02:15.867 --> 02:17.867
SO, YOU PROTECTED YOURSELF
AHEAD OF TIME.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.333
I DON'T TELL MY WIFE ANYTHING,
I DON'T CONFIDE IN MY WIFE.

02:20.367 --> 02:22.233
I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.733
I JUST TREAT HER
LIKE AN ACQUAINTANCE.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.967
DO YOU THINK I WANT HER
BLABBING ABOUT ME TO PEOPLE ?

02:26.067 --> 02:27.700
NO, NO...

02:27.733 --> 02:29.567
IF WE GOT DIVORCED TOMORROW,
SHE'D HAVE NOTHING TO SAY,

02:29.600 --> 02:31.167
NOTHING SHE COULD SAY.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.167
OR MAYBE SHE COULD SAY
I HATE A COUPLE OF PEOPLE,

02:33.200 --> 02:35.200
BUT THAT'S,
BUT THAT'S IT.

02:35.233 --> 02:36.733
I PROBABLY SAID A COUPLE
NASTY THINGS ABOUT YOU,

02:36.767 --> 02:37.800
BUT OTHER THAN THAT...

02:37.833 --> 02:40.100
WELL, THAT'S ASSUMED, SO...

02:40.133 --> 02:42.300
I DO NEED YOU TO
DO ME A HUGE FAVOR,

02:42.333 --> 02:45.200
AND THAT IS GO OVER BY MY HOUSE
AND GET MY CLOTHES.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.300
SUSIE WILL KNOW
ALL ABOUT IT, AND, UH...

02:47.333 --> 02:48.533
SHE'S GONNA BE THERE ?

02:48.567 --> 02:50.333
YEAH, SHE PROBABLY
WILL BE THERE.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.700
PUSHING SECRET CODES
AND ALL THAT.

02:52.733 --> 02:54.800
SHE'LL EAT ME ALIVE.

02:54.833 --> 02:55.967
JUST GRAB MY STUFF.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.567
BOY, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S, LIKE...

02:57.600 --> 03:01.567
IT'S ALMOST WORSE THAN
CONFRONTING A MOURNER.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.567
I OWE YOU, BIG TIME.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.600
NO, YOU DON'T OWE ME.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.300
I'LL GO LATER TODAY.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.933
OH, MY GOD.

03:16.967 --> 03:18.967
YOU WOULD NOT
BELIEVE THIS ARTICLE.

03:19.067 --> 03:22.467
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT A
POLITICAL AGENDA TRIPLE "A" HAS.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.700
HONESTLY.

03:23.733 --> 03:27.400
THEY JUST WANT MORE ROADS,
SO, THERE WILL BE MORE CARS,

03:27.433 --> 03:30.133
SO, THEY'LL HAVE MORE MEMBERS
AND MORE MONEY COMING IN.

03:30.167 --> 03:33.333
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT,

03:33.367 --> 03:35.200
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT POLLUTION,

03:35.233 --> 03:37.433
AND WE'RE MEMBERS !

04:05.600 --> 04:07.800

04:26.467 --> 04:28.933
FOR YOU TO WANT TO HAVE SEX
IN THE AFTERNOON,

04:28.967 --> 04:30.067
IS KIND OF CRAZY.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.067
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I DIDN'T SAY I WANTED TO

04:31.067 --> 04:32.867

FOR A VERBAL RESPONSE, $10.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.300
ANYBODY WANT TO MAKE $10
AND RESPOND VERBALLY ?

11:20.333 --> 11:22.067
NO ?

11:28.367 --> 11:30.633
( Larry David )
SO, THEN HE CALLS ME
A BALD TURD.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.867
FIVE MINUTES LATER,
MY TIRE...

11:33.900 --> 11:36.467
OH, JESUS CHRIST,
SO, HE CUT IT,

11:36.500 --> 11:37.567
HE SLASHED THE TIRE.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.267
SLASHED THE TIRE, YEAH.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.700
SONOFABITCH.

11:40.733 --> 11:42.600
THE GUY'S COMING
WITH MY CAR

11:42.633 --> 11:44.367
AND I GOT TO DRIVE HIM
BACK TO THE GAS STATION,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.133
SO, I GOT TO
GO DOWNSTAIRS.

11:46.167 --> 11:47.500
NOW ?

11:47.533 --> 11:50.067
YEAH, IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
HE'S GONNA BE HERE.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.267
I'M SORRY.

11:51.300 --> 11:54.800
ALRIGHT, DID YOU GET
A LICENSE PLATE OR ANYTHING ?

11:54.833 --> 11:57.567
THE GUY'S LICENSE
IS "14 THOR".

11:57.600 --> 11:58.767
"14 THOR" ?

11:58.800 --> 12:01.100
AND HE LOOKED LIKE
A NORDSMAN OF SOME KIND ?

12:01.133 --> 12:03.200
THERE'S A GUY,
THERE'S A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER,

12:03.233 --> 12:04.233
YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE GUYS...

12:04.267 --> 12:09.700
HIS FIRST NAME'S THOR,
THOR, UM, OLESON.

12:09.733 --> 12:10.833
THOR OLESON.

12:10.867 --> 12:13.700
THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.967
AND I THINK, THERE'S
A BIG WRESTLING THING IN TOWN

12:17.067 --> 12:18.567
AT THE STAPLES CENTER,
IT COULD BE HIM.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.633
YOU'RE KIDDING ?

12:19.667 --> 12:21.433
HE'S IN L.A. FOR THIS...

12:21.467 --> 12:23.400
YEAH, WHO ELSE WOULD
HAVE A PLATE LIKE THAT ?

12:23.433 --> 12:24.900
AND HE SOUNDED
LIKE A WRESTLER

12:24.933 --> 12:26.300
WHEN HE WAS
STANDING OVER MY WINDOW
SAYING "ARGH ARGH"

12:26.333 --> 12:27.400
HE WAS DOING THAT VOICE.

12:27.433 --> 12:29.067
YEAH, IT SOUNDS JUST,
THE DESCRIPTION IS LIKE

12:29.100 --> 12:30.267
EXACTLY THE SAME
AS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

12:30.300 --> 12:31.667
BIG, HUGE GUY,
LONG, BLOND IR.

12:31.700 --> 12:32.700
WHAT'S THIS THING ?

12:32.733 --> 12:35.433
OH, THAT ?

12:35.467 --> 12:36.633
YOU EVER GET
ONE OF THESE ?

12:36.667 --> 12:37.900
NO, WHAT ARE THESE ?

12:37.933 --> 12:40.667
SUPPOSEDLY, I DROVE THROUGH
SOME SORT OF RED LIGHT,

12:40.700 --> 12:43.067
OR AN INTERSECTION OF SOME KIND,
AND I HAVE THESE PHOTOS NOW.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.600
HOLY COW,
THEY TOOK YOUR PICTURE ?

12:44.633 --> 12:47.833
YEAH, THEY HAD THE THING
UP ON THE LIGHT.

12:47.867 --> 12:50.267
I DON'T MIND IT
IF THEY ACTUALLY CATCH YOU

12:50.300 --> 12:52.567
DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL,
BUT NOT ON CAMERA.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.533
JESUS, AM I FAT.

12:54.567 --> 12:56.700
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
PUT ON A COUPLE OF POUNDS.

12:56.733 --> 12:57.800
YEAH, YEAH.

12:57.833 --> 13:00.100
HORRENDOUS.

13:00.133 --> 13:03.067
WELL, I'M REAL SORRY,
WHAT A WASTED DAY.

13:03.067 --> 13:04.300
NO, LISTEN.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.067
ALRIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU,
YOU WANT TO DO TOMORROW ?

13:06.067 --> 13:08.200
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
THAT MUCH TO GO OVER, REALLY.

13:08.233 --> 13:10.200
YEAH, LET'S MAKE
A TIME WITH VERA,

13:10.233 --> 13:11.433
YOU'LL COME BACK
IN TOMORROW,

13:11.467 --> 13:13.133
I GOT SOME OPENINGS
IN THE AFTERNOON,

13:13.167 --> 13:14.833
AND, UH, WE'LL KICK IT AROUND
FOR AN HOUR OR SO.

13:14.867 --> 13:15.900
WE'LL GET INTO IT.

13:15.933 --> 13:17.367
OKAY, I WAS
KIND OF THINKING

13:17.400 --> 13:21.233
MAYBE TOMORROW WE COULD DO IT
IN MY OFFICE IN SANTA MONICA ?

13:21.267 --> 13:25.600
NO, LET'S, THAT'S OKAY,
LET'S NOT DO THAT.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.600
WE'LL DO IT HERE.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.067
THIS IS GOOD,
THIS WORKS.

13:29.100 --> 13:30.400
THIS IS GOOD.

13:30.433 --> 13:34.333
WELL, IT'S KIND OF
A LOT EASIER FOR ME,

13:34.367 --> 13:37.233
IF WE COULD DO IT
IN SANTA MONICA.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.533
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I CAME HERE TODAY,

13:39.567 --> 13:40.933
SO, TOMORROW MAYBE...

13:40.967 --> 13:43.467
YEAH, IT JUST, IT KIND OF WORKS
A LITTLE BETTER FOR ME,

13:43.500 --> 13:44.900
IF YOU COME HERE.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.200
IT'S A LITTLE EASIER.

13:46.233 --> 13:49.167
I CAN FOCUS ON IT
A LITTLE BETTER.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.733
I GOT A VERY
NICE OFFICE.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.433
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO
FOCUS ON ANYTHING.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.067
I GOT A VERY
COMFORTABLE CHAIR.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.433
I GOT BLACKBOARDS UP THERE,
WE CAN WRITE IT ALL OUT.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.833
YOU KNOW,
IT'LL BE A BREEZE.

13:58.867 --> 14:00.867
IT'S NOT THE OFFICE,
I'M VERY LOW MAINTENANCE.

14:00.900 --> 14:04.300
YOU KNOW, WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A MEETING.

14:04.333 --> 14:05.533
AND WE HAVEN'T
HAD A MEETING.

14:05.567 --> 14:08.800
SO, LET'S START BY DOING
WHAT WE SET OUT TO DO.

14:08.833 --> 14:10.767
LET'S ACCOMPLISH THAT,
LET'S HAVE A MEETING,

14:10.800 --> 14:11.767
HERE AT MY OFFICE.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.067
WE DID ATTEMPT TO
HAVE THE MEETING,

14:13.067 --> 14:15.067
AND I DID MAKE
THE DRIVE PART.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.633
SO, THE DRIVE PART,
THAT I DID DO.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.967
YEAH, THE DRIVING,
YOU GOT DOWN GOOD, BUT UH...

14:20.067 --> 14:21.433
SO, THAT'S A LITTLE
OUT OF BALANCE NOW.

14:21.467 --> 14:22.667
'CAUSE I DID
MY DRIVE, AND...

14:22.700 --> 14:23.833
IT, BUT IT'S NOT
OUT OF BALANCE,

14:23.867 --> 14:25.400
'CAUSE YOU WERE DRIVING
AND I WAS WAITING.

14:25.433 --> 14:27.600
SO, BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
WE DIDN'T MEET.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.967
WELL, THE WAITING,
THERE'S A LOT TO DO
WHILE YOU'RE WAITING.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.500
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO
WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.600
TOMORROW, IF YOU WANT TO
DRIVE TO MY OFFICE,

14:32.633 --> 14:33.733
I'LL BE HAPPY YOU CAN
KEEP ME WAITING

14:33.767 --> 14:34.767
FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
I KNOW,
BUT WE MADE A PLAN.

14:35.833 --> 14:36.867
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT, YEAH...

14:36.900 --> 14:38.167
WE SET UP A PLAN.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.200
WE SAID, WE'LL MEET AT MY OFFICE
AND WE'LL HAVE A MEETING.

14:40.233 --> 14:41.333
YES.

14:41.367 --> 14:42.533
THAT'S THE PLAN,

14:42.567 --> 14:44.867
THAT HASN'T BEEN ACCOMPLISHED,
LET'S ACCOMPLISH THAT.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.067
BUT WE ATTEMPTED TO HAVE
THE MEETING, BUT IT WAS ABORTED.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.100
THEN WE FAILED,
LET'S HAVE THAT MEETING.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.567
WE, WE'RE HAVING THAT
MEETING RIGHT NOW.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.133
THIS IS NOT A MEETING
ABOUT THE SHOW.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.767
THIS IS A MEETING
ABOUT HAVING A MEETING.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.067
I KNOW, BUT THE INTENTION
IS THE SAME,

14:57.067 --> 14:58.133
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ?

14:58.167 --> 15:00.233
I DROVE HERE
WITH THE SAME INTENTION...

15:00.267 --> 15:02.733
THE DRIVING IS NOT
THE MEETING, LARRY.

15:02.767 --> 15:03.867
THE DRIVING IS
WHAT WE'RE TALKING...

15:03.900 --> 15:06.133
THE DRIVING IS WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:06.167 --> 15:08.467
YOU KEEP COMING BACK TO
THIS INSANE THING WITH DRIVING.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.600
YES !

15:09.633 --> 15:11.433
DRIVING IS NOT THE ISSUE,
DO WE NOT...

15:11.467 --> 15:12.700
I THINK DRIVING
IS THE ISSUE.

15:12.733 --> 15:14.600
WE HAD A SINGULAR PLAN.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.567
WE WERE GONNA HAVE
A MEETING ABOUT THE SHOW.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.633
YEAH, OKAY, SO WE'RE
HAVING A MEETING.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.867
YOU COULD DRIVE
AROUND THE WORLD,

15:18.900 --> 15:21.200
WE STILL HAVEN'T
HAD A MEETING !

15:23.867 --> 15:24.933
CHERYL ?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.133
YES ?

15:26.167 --> 15:29.200
WHAT DID YOU DO ?

15:29.233 --> 15:31.067
YOU CANCELED TRIPLE "A" ?

15:31.067 --> 15:32.400
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ?

15:32.433 --> 15:34.367
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU
WERE CANCELING TRIPLE "A" ?

15:34.400 --> 15:38.367
WELL, AFTER THAT ARTICLE,
HOW COULD I NOT ?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.067
I WAS READING IT TO YOU.

15:40.067 --> 15:41.133
YOU DIDN'T SAY
YOU WERE CANCELING IT.

15:41.167 --> 15:42.167
WELL, I WAS GOING TO
TELL YOU WHEN YOU GOT HOME.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.400
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS URGENT.

15:43.433 --> 15:45.733
OH, WELL THAT'S GREAT,
I HAD TO CHANGE A TIRE.

15:45.767 --> 15:48.133
AND THEN, LOOK,
LOOK AT THIS.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.167
WHAT HAPPENED ?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.200
IT'S A LONG STORY.

15:50.233 --> 15:51.533
I GOT TO GO
CHANGE MY CLOTHES.

15:51.567 --> 15:53.400
I GOT TO GO TO JEFF'S HOUSE
AND PICK UP HIS CLOTHES.

15:53.433 --> 15:54.767
OH, BY THE WAY,

15:54.800 --> 15:56.867
WHY DID YOU TELL WANDA
SHE HAS A BIG ASS ?

15:56.900 --> 15:59.767
I DIDN'T TELL WANDA
SHE HAD A BIG ASS.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.767
SHE JUST CALLED ME
AND TOLD ME.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.700
I DIDN'T SAY SHE
HAD A BIG ASS, OKAY.

16:04.733 --> 16:06.600
I YELLED OUT THE WINDOW
AND I SAID,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.667
"I'D KNOW THAT TUSH ANYWHERE",
THAT'S ALL I SAID.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.700
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT ?

16:09.733 --> 16:11.733
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
COMMENT ABOUT HER ASS ?

16:11.767 --> 16:13.067
WHY, WHAT'S THE,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

16:13.067 --> 16:15.067
BECAUSE, YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST GO CALL OUT AND SAY,

16:15.067 --> 16:17.600
"HEY, YOU GOT A REALLY BIG ASS",
IT'S THE SAME THING.

16:17.633 --> 16:20.100
AH, IT WAS JUST
A FRIENDLY REMARK, THAT'S ALL.

16:20.133 --> 16:21.200
THAT'S A FRIENDLY REMARK ?

16:21.233 --> 16:22.567
YEAH, I WAS JUST
BEING NICE.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.400
I WAS BEING NICE
AND CHUMMY.

16:24.433 --> 16:27.567
YOU DON'T YELL A COMMENT
ABOUT A WOMAN'S ASS.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.433
THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO TAKE IT.

16:29.467 --> 16:30.800
NO, NO, IF SHE
HAD A SMALL ASS,

16:30.833 --> 16:33.467
I COULD HAVE SAID, I KNOW THAT
TUSH ANYWHERE, SO WHAT ?

16:33.500 --> 16:34.967
YOU SHOULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.467
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST
SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT...

16:36.500 --> 16:37.700
ANYWAY, WHY,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

16:37.733 --> 16:38.933
WHAT IF I DID SAY
SHE HAS A BIG ASS ?

16:38.967 --> 16:39.967
SO WHAT,
THAT'S NOT SO TERRIBLE.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.067
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH A BIG ASS ?

16:41.100 --> 16:43.333
I LIKE BIG ASSES,
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

16:43.367 --> 16:47.067
YOU LIKE BIG ASSES ?

16:47.067 --> 16:48.567
I DON'T MIND A BIG ASS.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.700
I MEAN, NO,
NOT NECESSARILY BIG.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.800
NO, THIS IS INTERESTING,
YOU LOVE BIG ASSES ?

16:52.833 --> 16:54.433
NO, WHAT, NO,
I DON'T LOVE BIG ASSES.

16:54.467 --> 16:55.867
HOW BIG DO
YOU LIKE 'EM ?

16:55.900 --> 16:57.233
I LIKE 'EM JUST
THE REGULAR,

16:57.267 --> 16:59.067
I LIKE THEM JUST
LIKE YOURS, OKAY ?

16:59.067 --> 17:02.533
OH, BECAUSE MINE IS REALLY BIG,
AND I LIKE 'EM BIG.

17:02.567 --> 17:04.333
NO, IT'S NOT REALLY BIG,
IT'S NOT, IT'S A GOOD SIZE.

17:04.367 --> 17:05.533
THAT'S WHAT YOU
JUST SAID.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.700
YOU SAID, I LOVE BIG ASSES
AND I LIKE YOURS.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.267
NO, I SAID,
I DON'T MIND 'EM.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.467
I LIKE YOUR, YEAH, I LIKE,
YOU KNOW, UH...

17:11.500 --> 17:14.100
YOU SEE, THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT YOU
I DON'T KNOW.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.700
NO, THERE'S
NOTHING ABOUT ME.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.800
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD THIS ASS FETISH.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.333
DON'T SAY I HAVE A,
I DON'T HAVE AN ASS FETISH.

17:19.367 --> 17:20.533
NO, NO,
THIS IS VERY KINKY.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.633
IT'S, LIKE, ALL THIS STUFF
IS UNFOLDING NOW.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.667
NOTHING'S UNFOLDING !

17:23.700 --> 17:25.800
THIS IS INTERESTING.
AFTER YEARS TOGETHER,

17:25.833 --> 17:26.900
I'M JUST FINDING OUT...

17:26.933 --> 17:28.433
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY, NO !

17:28.467 --> 17:32.200
THAT'S SO UNTRUE,
NO, I'M NOT A DEVIANT.

17:32.233 --> 17:34.900
( doorbell )

17:34.933 --> 17:38.333
I DIDN'T SAY DEVIANT.

17:38.367 --> 17:41.233
DON'T SAY I HAVE AN ASS FETISH,
YOU GOT NOTHING ON ME.

17:41.267 --> 17:42.367
ARE YOU EXPECTING SOMEBODY ?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.367
WHAT ?WANDA.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.367
HI.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.367
HEY.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.367
C'MON IN.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.967
HEY.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.100
HEY.

17:50.133 --> 17:53.300
OKAY, WANDA...

17:53.333 --> 17:54.833
OH, YOU KNOW
WHO I AM, OKAY.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.433
I THOUGHT I HAD TO TURN AROUND,
AND SHOW YOU MY BIG ASS.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.367
YOU COMPLETELY,
COMPLETELY MISINTERPRETED THAT.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.500
I DIDN'T SAY YOU
HAD A BIG ASS.

18:02.533 --> 18:03.967
YOU YELLED OUT,
"HEY, BIG ASS WANDA".

18:04.067 --> 18:05.533
NO, I DIDN'T SAY BIG ASS,
I WAS JUST SAYING HELLO.

18:05.567 --> 18:08.833
IS THAT HOW
YOU SAY HELLO ?

18:08.867 --> 18:09.900
UH, WELL...

18:09.933 --> 18:11.100
IS THAT A,
HEY, BIG ASS.

18:11.133 --> 18:14.233
OR, HEY, HEY ASSY,
OR, HEY, I KNOW YOUR ASS.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.333
WHAT IS THAT, THAT'S NOT
HOW YOU SAY HELLO, IS IT ?

18:16.367 --> 18:17.633
PERHAPS NOT.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.433
SO, SOMETHING ABOUT MY ASS
HAS MADE YOU DOWNLOAD IT

18:20.467 --> 18:22.100
AND YOU STORED IT
IN YOUR MEMORY.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.433
NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT SO.

18:24.467 --> 18:26.267
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THIS MAN ?

18:26.300 --> 18:27.533
WE WERE JUST
HAVING A DISCUSSION.

18:27.567 --> 18:28.800
WOULD YOU, DID YOU TELL HIM
HOW WRONG IT IS TO EVEN SAY

18:28.833 --> 18:29.833
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ?

18:29.867 --> 18:31.067
YEAH, BELIEVE ME,
I TOLD HIM.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.833
YOU KNOW, A WOMAN'S ASS
IS VERY PERSONAL.

18:33.867 --> 18:36.600
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS SO OBSESSED
WITH ASSES UNTIL TODAY.

18:36.633 --> 18:37.667
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU HAVE AN ASS MAN.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.700
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?

18:38.733 --> 18:39.700
LARRY, YOU ARE
AN ASS MAN.

18:39.733 --> 18:40.700
I AM NOT AN ASS MAN.

18:40.733 --> 18:41.700
YOU ARE AN ASS MAN.

18:41.733 --> 18:42.733
WHAT A FETISH ?

18:42.767 --> 18:47.067
I DON'T HAVE ANY
ASS FETISH, OKAY.

18:47.067 --> 18:49.400
OBSESSED WITH ASSES,
I AM NOT OBSESSED WITH ASSES.

18:49.433 --> 18:50.533
OKAY, ASSY.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.267
AND WHY IS THAT,
THAT SHIT ALL OVER YOU ?

18:52.300 --> 18:54.567
WHAT YOU BEEN DOING,
SCROUNGING AROUND
LOOKING FOR ASSES ?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.667
ALL IN THE BLEACHERS AND STUFF,
OH, WHERE'S THE ASS ?

18:59.600 --> 19:01.967
( doorbell )

19:02.067 --> 19:05.700
OH, IF IT ISN'T JEFFREY'S
MESSENGER BOY.

19:05.733 --> 19:09.533
HE IS SUCH A SLIMY,
SPINELESS CREATURE, LARRY,

19:09.567 --> 19:11.567
THAT HE SENDS YOU TO
DO HIS DIRTY WORK.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.767
DON'T YOU RESENT IT ?

19:12.800 --> 19:15.267
UH, NO, I'M FINE.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.133
ALRIGHT, LET'S GET
THIS OVER WITH, C'MON.

19:21.067 --> 19:24.267
HE CAN'T EVEN FACE ME,
THAT FAT FUCK.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.533
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, LARRY,

19:25.567 --> 19:27.133
THAT HE SENDS YOU,
HIS FRIEND,

19:27.167 --> 19:29.500
HE PUTS YOU IN
THIS AWKWARD POSITION,

19:29.533 --> 19:31.400
LIKE ALL THE TIMES
HE USED TO KEEP SECRETS.

19:31.433 --> 19:32.500
NO, IT'S NOT AWKWARD.

19:32.533 --> 19:33.833
IT'S NOT AWKWARD,
THERE'S NO SECRETS.

19:33.867 --> 19:35.733
HONEST, IT'S NOT EVEN AWKWARD,
I'M VERY COMFORTABLE.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.067
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW,

19:37.100 --> 19:38.900
ABOUT ALL THE LITTLE BIMBOS
THAT THESE LITTLE ACTRESSES.

19:38.933 --> 19:39.967
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

19:40.067 --> 19:42.067
HE TELLS THEM
HE'S GOING TO GIVE THEM PARTS,

19:42.067 --> 19:43.500
AND HELP THEIR CAREERS,

19:43.533 --> 19:44.600
SO HE CAN GET
A NICE LITTLE BLOW JOB.

19:44.633 --> 19:45.700
I KNOW HIM.

19:45.733 --> 19:46.767
BLOW JOB ?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.100
HE THINKS I DON'T
KNOW THIS SHIT.

19:48.133 --> 19:50.267
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU,
WHAT DID HE SAY ?

19:50.300 --> 19:51.667
DID HE TELL YOU
I KICKED HIM OUT ?

19:51.700 --> 19:54.167
YEAH, HIS MALE EGO,
HIS STUPID MALE...

19:54.200 --> 19:55.900
HE THINKS I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT PORN STASH,

19:55.933 --> 19:56.967
TAKE ALL THIS CRAP.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.067
HE'S GONNA NEED THIS
ALONE IN THE HOTEL.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.367
NO, HE TOLD ME SPECIFICALLY

19:59.400 --> 20:00.700
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT
ANY OF THIS STUFF.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.733
OH, YEAH, "FREAK THAT BOOTY",
"BIG ASS MOMMA",

20:02.767 --> 20:03.900
ALL HIS FAVORITES.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.633
THINK I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THIS CRAP ?

20:06.933 --> 20:08.800
OH, YOU'RE INTO
THIS SHIT TOO ?

20:08.833 --> 20:10.067
YOU'RE INTO THE KINKY
BIG ASS MOMMA CRAP ?

20:10.100 --> 20:11.600
NO, WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY ?

20:11.633 --> 20:12.867
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE A FAMILY MAN.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.333
NO, I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
THAT WOMAN FROM THE BACK.

20:15.367 --> 20:16.500
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.667
YOUR PERVERSE,
FAT FUCK MANAGER,

20:18.700 --> 20:20.633
YOU KNOW,
WHAT HE MAKES ME DO ?

20:20.667 --> 20:23.167
HE VIOLATES ME, LARRY.
HE DEFILES ME...

20:23.200 --> 20:24.567
NO, NO,
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.600
AT NIGHT,
HE MAKES ME...

20:25.633 --> 20:26.600
( doorbell )

20:26.633 --> 20:27.633
WHO'S THAT ?

20:31.167 --> 20:32.733
SUSIE,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

20:32.767 --> 20:33.800
WHERE'S JEFF ?

20:33.833 --> 20:35.100
WHERE'S JEFF ?

20:35.133 --> 20:37.300
YOU'VE DONE
SOMETHING ROTTEN.

20:37.333 --> 20:39.133
WHAT IS THIS,
WHAT IS THIS ?

20:39.167 --> 20:41.400
ALRIGHT, JEFFREY IS AT A HOTEL,
LARRY IS BRINGING THE CLOTHES.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.667
I'M TAKING THE CLOTHES TO
THE HOTEL FOR HIM.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.700
OH, I WANT TO TALK,
COULD I GO WITH YOU,

20:45.733 --> 20:46.733
PLEASE, TO THE HOTEL ?

20:46.767 --> 20:47.833
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

20:47.867 --> 20:48.900
NO, NO,
YOU'LL GET EXCITED,

20:48.933 --> 20:50.767
YOU'RE OVERWORKED
NOW, JUST STOP IT.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.533
NOW, I WANT TO
SEE MY BOY.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.633
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY,
TAKE MOM TO THE HOTEL.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.000
DAD, YOU STAY HERE
WITH ME, OKAY.

20:56.033 --> 20:58.267
OKAY, VERY GOOD.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.633
WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

20:59.667 --> 21:02.233
WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

21:02.267 --> 21:05.633
I'M SURE YOU HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS,

21:05.667 --> 21:07.233
YOU ROTTEN BASTARD !

21:10.300 --> 21:12.700
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO PUT
THOSE CLOTHES OF JEFF'S,

21:12.733 --> 21:13.800
JUST THROW THEM OFF...

21:13.833 --> 21:15.100
WHY, WHY ?

21:15.133 --> 21:17.700
WHY DID YOU JUST THROW THEM IN,
ON, IN THE TRUNK,

21:17.733 --> 21:19.967
ON TOP OF A
DIRTY OLD TIRE, WHY ?

21:20.067 --> 21:21.233
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY
SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.

21:21.267 --> 21:22.367
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.667
YEAH, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME,
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.800
WHY WOULD ANYBODY DO THAT,
A PERSON WOULDN'T DO THAT.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.367
I DON'T HAVE
A CLOSET IN MY HOUSE.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.233
I'M JUST USED TO THROWING
THINGS AROUND LIKE THAT.

21:29.267 --> 21:30.233
AND THROWING THEM
ON THE FLOOR.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.333
I THROW THEM
ON THE FLOOR,

21:31.367 --> 21:33.433
THAT'S HOW ALL
MY CLOTHES ARE AT HOME,

21:33.467 --> 21:35.133
ALL ON THE FLOOR,
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A BED.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.900
I SLEEP ON
A BIG PILE OF CLOTHES.

21:36.933 --> 21:38.900
WELL, IT'S
JUST DISGUSTING.

21:38.933 --> 21:40.067
I'M A DISGUSTING MAN.

21:40.100 --> 21:42.733
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT,
I'M JUST, I'M SO...

21:42.767 --> 21:44.333
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED IN ME.
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED.

21:44.367 --> 21:45.633
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.167
WELL, NOW WHAT'S THIS ?

21:47.200 --> 21:49.633
"LOOSE FAT,
AS FAST AS YOU CAN."

21:49.667 --> 21:50.767
OH, YEAH, REALLY.

21:50.800 --> 21:54.633
THAT SOUNDS GOOD,
I'D LIKE TO GET THAT NUMBER.

21:54.667 --> 21:56.133
HAVE YOU GOT A PEN,
LET ME PUT THAT DOWN.

21:56.167 --> 21:57.167
THERE'S ONE
IN THE BACK SEAT.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.500
ALRIGHT.

22:05.133 --> 22:07.067
( groaning )

22:17.067 --> 22:20.067
IN MY DAY,
NOBODY GOT DIVORCED.

22:20.067 --> 22:24.733
YOU KNOW, ONE LITTLE PROBLEM,
AND NOWADAYS IT'S GOOD-BYE,

22:24.767 --> 22:26.767
GRAB YOUR CLOTHES,
AND YOU'RE GONE.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.700
PEOPLE LIVE TOGETHER
FOR YEARS AND YEARS,

22:29.733 --> 22:32.100
HATING EACH OTHER DESPERATELY,
BUT STILL THEY...

22:32.133 --> 22:33.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

22:33.633 --> 22:35.733
OH, YOU LIKE
THAT OLD CAR.

22:35.767 --> 22:37.400
YOU KNOW
THE BACK SEAT FACES OUT.

22:37.433 --> 22:39.667
SO THAT YOU CAN
SEE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN.

22:39.700 --> 22:43.833

22:49.467 --> 22:50.467
ISN'T IT A BEAUTY ?

22:50.500 --> 22:51.500
YEAH, IT'S LOVELY.

22:51.533 --> 22:52.967

22:54.400 --> 22:56.067
DID JEFF SAY HE WAS
GONNA MEET US HERE ?

22:56.067 --> 22:57.367
HE'S GONNA MEET US
IN THE LOBBY.

22:57.400 --> 22:58.700
IN THE LOBBY, WELL,
I DON'T SEE HIM.

22:58.733 --> 23:00.067

24:10.900 --> 24:15.167
I WANT YOU TO LET THE AIR

24:15.200 --> 24:18.267
IT SAYS "14 THOR"
ON THE LICENSE PLATE.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.967
IT'S A RED STATION WAGON,
IT'S RIGHT OUT IN FRONT,

24:20.067 --> 24:21.100
YOU CAN'T MISS IT.

24:21.133 --> 24:23.533

24:43.533 --> 24:44.567
GOOD, HEY, LISTEN.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.233
YOUR DAD'S THAT WRESTLER,
ISN'T HE ?

24:46.267 --> 24:47.300
YEP.THOR.

24:47.333 --> 24:48.333
THOR, YEAH, YEAH.

24:48.367 --> 24:49.600
BIG TALL GUY.

24:49.633 --> 24:51.867
WELL, LISTEN, I GOT A LITTLE
PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR YOU

24:51.900 --> 24:54.100
THAT MIGHT INTEREST YOU.

24:54.133 --> 24:56.067
WRESTLING'S FIXED.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.967
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

24:58.067 --> 25:00.800
ALL THE MATCHES
ARE SET UP BEFORE HAND.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.633
THE WINNERS ARE
ALL PRE-DETERMINED.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.800
IT'S COMPLETELY
ILLEGITIMATE.

25:04.833 --> 25:06.267
YOU MEAN,
IT'S FAKE ?

25:06.300 --> 25:07.900
EXACTLY, FAKE.

25:07.933 --> 25:10.067
THAT'S EXACTLY
THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR.

25:10.067 --> 25:12.333
DAD'S KIND OF A BIG FAKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS ?

25:12.367 --> 25:14.833
HE'S MORE OF AN ACTOR
THAN A WRESTLER.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.200
DAD'S AN ACTOR ?

25:16.233 --> 25:20.300
THAT'S RIGHT, THE WHOLE THING'S
A BIG PHONEY BOLOGNA.

25:20.333 --> 25:24.933
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
NOBODY THINKS IT'S REAL.

25:24.967 --> 25:35.067
HEY, YOU TELL HIM
THE BALD TURD SAID HELLO, OKAY ?

25:35.067 --> 25:44.300
HEY, YOU TELL HIM
THE BALD TURD SAID HELLO, OKAY ?

25:53.800 --> 25:54.900
HI.

25:54.933 --> 25:55.967
HEY.

25:56.067 --> 25:58.533
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO TODAY ?

25:58.567 --> 25:59.567
WORKING.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.700
OH, REALLY ?

26:00.733 --> 26:02.300
YOU AND JASON
WORKED THINGS OUT ?

26:02.333 --> 26:05.467
NO, WE CAN'T SEEM TO AGREE ON
THE LOCUS EQUIDISTANT OF POINTS.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.100
I SUGGESTED A RESTAURANT,

26:07.133 --> 26:08.300
HE THOUGHT IT
WAS TOO CLOSE TO ME.

26:08.333 --> 26:09.467
THEN HE SUGGESTED ONE,

26:09.500 --> 26:10.767
AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS TOO CLOSE TO HIM,

26:10.800 --> 26:14.867
AND, WE JUST CAN'T
GET IT TOGETHER.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.333
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.933
ARE YOU EXPECTING
SOMETHING FROM THE CITY ?
