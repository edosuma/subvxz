WEBVTT

00:18.268 --> 00:19.977
What do you say now?

00:20.938 --> 00:22.563
I don't know.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.149
You said your dad wouldn't be home
for an hour.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.442
I know, but you don't know...

00:26.568 --> 00:28.986
- Don't you love me?
- Of course. You know I do.

00:29.113 --> 00:30.780
Come on. Let's do it.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.449
All right.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.171
- Where are they?
- Nightstand.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.014
Gentlemen, start your engines.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.605
I so want this car!

01:29.590 --> 01:31.799
Oh, my God! You're bleeding.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.968
Look out!

02:34.279 --> 02:35.571
What lie are they telling you?

02:35.697 --> 02:38.032
I'll check on it. Okay.

02:38.826 --> 02:39.951
Yes.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.329
Come on.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.456
Okay, thank you.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.418
Okay, pharmaceuticals
were delivered this morning.

02:49.545 --> 02:52.964
But Shipping accidentally sent the box
with Vicodin to Research.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.049
That's a tough one.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.884
If only we had some way to
communicate

02:57.010 --> 02:59.178
with another part of the building.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.681
16-year-old M.V.A. victim.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.517
He's been in and out of the hospital
for three weeks with internal bleeding.

03:04.643 --> 03:05.601
No one can find the cause.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.604
Internal bleeding after a car accident.
Wow, that's shocking.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.857
Let me talk to Shipping.
I speak their language.

03:10.983 --> 03:11.983
It's been three weeks...

03:12.109 --> 03:14.151
Your hospital doesn't have
my pain medication.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.946
Shipping says it's going to be an hour.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.489
This is Dr. Cuddy. What's going on?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.324
The crash didn't cause the bleed.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.826
Right. The bleed caused the crash.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.911
Blood got on the road,
got all slippery.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.913
Anyone in here got drugs?

03:28.292 --> 03:30.835
She saw his blood, she got distracted,
she crashed his dad's Porsche.

03:30.961 --> 03:31.919
Dad will love that.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.088
- He was...
- Don't talk.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.631
It's gonna be an hour.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.924
Thank God you took control.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.426
If you can't wait one hour to...

03:38.552 --> 03:40.094
Kid's got hemolytic anemia.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.929
Kid? How old?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.723
He must have inherited it.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.308
He's gonna die. My condolences.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.517
Wasn't inherited.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.352
The problem's outside
the red blood cells.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.689
This is impossible. A 16-year-old
does not get hemolytic anemia.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.609
Give her back the file. You have bigger
problems to tend to, like my meds.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.070
Elevated indirect bilirubin,
low serum haptoglobin.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.614
He's got meningitis.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.740
No.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.619
Artificial heart valve.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.786
No.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.920
Get everyone in my office.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.672
Kid's going to be dead
in a matter of days

04:16.798 --> 04:19.467
if we don't figure out why his red
blood cells are disintegrating.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.677
So, differential diagnosis, people.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.095
Well, it's not environmental.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.057
Dad hired a company to clean the
house, maid washed all the clothes,

04:26.183 --> 04:28.017
bought hypoallergenic sheets
and pillows.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.101
You want us to re-check?

04:29.227 --> 04:32.271
No. If it's environmental, he'll get
better just from staying here.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.397
It could be an infection.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.565
No fever. No white count.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.067
Well, he's 99.2.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.610
Barely above normal.

04:37.736 --> 04:40.321
But above.
His body's reacting to something.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.406
We could account for
the lack of fever and white count

04:42.532 --> 04:43.366
if it's lupus.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.076
Drugs will fit just
as much as lupus.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.661
Meth will cause hemolytic anemia.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.412
A lot of meth.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.456
Also,
doesn't exactly seem like the type.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.541
Because his dad drives a Porsche?

04:52.668 --> 04:55.378
Rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.671
Didn't mean to offend you.

04:56.797 --> 05:01.050
Okay! So it's infection,
lupus, drugs or cancer.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.928
- Cancer?
- Why not? Great meeting.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.181
Shouldn't we narrow it down
before we finish?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.183
My leg gave us till 11:15.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.978
I'll talk to Wilson about lymphoma,
ANA for lupus,

05:12.104 --> 05:13.896
radioimmunoassay for drugs,

05:14.022 --> 05:16.524
and you test for whatever
you thought it was.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.110
I've got a date with a pharmacist.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.737
Those are already done.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.199
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.492
Yeah.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.087
Excuse me.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.884
You know,
there are other ways to manage pain.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.929
Like what? Laughter? Meditation?

05:47.055 --> 05:49.557
Got a guy that can fix my third chakra?

05:49.683 --> 05:50.933
You're addicted.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.893
If the pills ran my life,
I'd agree with you,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.479
but it's my leg that's busy calendaring
what I can't do.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.689
You're in denial.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.941
Right.
I never had an infarction in my leg.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.860
No dead muscle, no nerve damage.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.155
Doesn't even hurt.
Actually, it kind of tickles.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.283
And chicks dig this better
than a puppy.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.453
It's not just your leg.
You want to get high.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.121
You're doing, what,
80 milligrams a day?

06:12.247 --> 06:14.123
No. That's way too much.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.168
Moderation is the key.
Unless there's pain.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.046
It's double what you were taking
when I hired you.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.506
'Cause you're twice as annoying.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.467
I can't always be here to protect you.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.510
Patients talk. Doctors talk.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.554
About how big your ass
has gotten lately?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.930
Not me. I defend it.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.682
You got back.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.233
You can't go a week without the drugs.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.944
No, I don't want to go
without the drugs. It'll hurt.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.863
No, you can't.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.032
If you're just getting off
pain medication, it will hurt.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.743
But... You won't be having
a great time, but you'll make it.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.913
If you're detoxing,
you'll have chills, nausea.

06:54.039 --> 06:57.792
Your pain will magnify five, 10 times.
You won't make it.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.960
Well, I guess we'll never know.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.755
I'll give you a week off clinic duty
if you can go a week without narcotics.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.507
No way. I love the clinic.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.884
You love the pills. Two weeks.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.220
The pills don't make me high,
they make me neutral.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.679
A month.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.520
You're on, mister.

07:21.733 --> 07:22.817
Drugs could cause this?

07:22.943 --> 07:25.820
Cocaine and meth are very hard
on the blood system.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.947
Has he had any erratic behavior?

07:28.073 --> 07:29.657
No, but...

07:32.077 --> 07:34.161
She was in rehab in the ninth grade.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.955
She's supposedly clean now, but...

07:36.081 --> 07:37.331
She obviously cares for him.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.959
Yeah, what she cared about was the car.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.294
Anniversary present from my wife.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.589
We drove it up north
to watch the leaves change.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.967
She was dead a year later.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.426
Cancer.

07:49.928 --> 07:50.970
I'm sorry.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.016
Mr. Foster, we're gonna test Keith
for drugs.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.893
I don't do drugs.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.313
You know, it's not
that we don't trust you, but...

08:01.940 --> 08:05.943
His hair will tell us any
drugs he's taken over the past 60 days.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.654
It's kind of like rings on a tree.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.288
Negative.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.416
Have you been sick?

08:20.542 --> 08:21.625
No, nothing.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.793
Have you been out of the country?

08:22.919 --> 08:26.297
We went to China, but we got
all our shots before we left.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.048
It could be an infection.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.718
We're going to give him
a gallium scan just to be safe.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.179
We inject a radioactive isotope
into his bloodstream,

08:33.305 --> 08:37.099
and we check to see if there's
inflammation anywhere in the body.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.227
Has he ever complained of
any joint pain?

08:40.353 --> 08:42.229
Sensitivity to light? Rashes?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.314
No, no. Nothing.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.774
Any relatives who've ever been
diagnosed with lupus?

08:45.901 --> 08:46.901
I don't even know what that is.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.571
In simple terms,
the body becomes allergic to itself.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.364
The immune system
attacks healthy cells

08:52.490 --> 08:54.658
in the circulatory system
and destroys them.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.036
Would it be treatable?

08:57.579 --> 08:59.330
It can be manageable.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.458
We can test for
the antibodies.

09:02.584 --> 09:06.003
Ninety-five percent of patients
with lupus have positive ANA.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.881
Not cloudy. Negative.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.883
What about bruising?

09:11.009 --> 09:15.095
Never complained of tenderness
under his arms or his groin?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.973
I'm not sure he'd tell me if he did.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.768
I guess I don't really know
what's going on in his life.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.978
- He's a teenager.
- Yeah.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.985
What type of cancer did your wife have?

09:31.947 --> 09:33.447
Pancreatic.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.867
It's his lymph nodes
we're concerned about.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.246
We're going to do a biopsy
to check for lymphoma.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.873
Can you feel this?

09:42.999 --> 09:43.832
No.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.084
Good.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.136
I have cancer, don't I?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.972
We're just testing.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.394
That's what they told my mom.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.694
Definitely not cancer.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.071
Nothing?

10:14.197 --> 10:15.030
Nothing.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.866
Negative for drugs. ANA was negative.
Gallium scan was clear.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.743
Yeah, I got that from the "nothing."

10:19.869 --> 10:21.787
- Where's his hematocrit?
- Thirteen.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.956
Drops any lower, he's not gonna have
enough red blood cells

10:24.082 --> 10:25.708
to bring oxygen to his body.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.918
He'll suffocate with his lungs
working perfectly.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.420
You okay?

10:30.130 --> 10:33.632
Excuse me, someone? Help. Please!

10:34.634 --> 10:36.510
Polite for a dying kid.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.932
How long has it been?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.434
I'm fine.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.894
There's something in my eye,
up at the top.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.062
Which eye?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.856
This one. What's happening?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.817
It's all right. Just look down for me.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.654
It's clear. There's nothing in it.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.780
It's getting worse.

10:56.906 --> 10:57.740
Is it fuzzy?

10:57.866 --> 10:59.533
No, it's dark.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.661
I can't see.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.761
It's a retinal clot
in the left eye.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.055
Coumadin would dissolve the clot,
fix his eyesight.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.682
You can't use blood thinners.
He's got internal bleeding.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.476
Fix the eye,
you'd kill everything else.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.644
Surgery's out for the same reason.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.979
We have two hours to figure this out.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.231
Either we restore the blood flow
or he loses the eye.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.485
Forget the eye.

11:34.611 --> 11:38.322
Tell him to use the other one
to look on the bright side.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.657
The clot tells us something.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.951
It could help us figure out
what he has,

11:43.119 --> 11:45.287
which could mean he gets to live.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.873
Differential diagnosis, people.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.793
How does internal bleeding
suddenly start clotting?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.504
It makes no sense.
They're opposing processes.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.713
It can happen in lupus.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.715
Increased platelet count
can cause blood clots.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.676
ANA was negative. It's not lupus.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.805
This is true.
But why are you the one saying it?

12:03.681 --> 12:07.142
What are you doing here?
I thought we ruled out cancer.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.019
I was lonely.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.355
Well, go see Cuddy.
She needs a friend.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.357
That's funny.
She said you might need one.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.775
That's why you're here?

12:14.901 --> 12:17.569
She wants you to keep an eye on me
to make sure I don't cheat.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.904
No, I wanted to make sure you don't

12:19.030 --> 12:20.823
start firing shots
from the clock tower.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.282
I'm fine.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.244
What's going on?

12:25.370 --> 12:27.830
He hasn't had Vicodin in over a day.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.958
Does your leg hurt?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.501
You ever been shot?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.670
There's gonna be side effects.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.713
Insomnia, depression, tachycardia.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.715
Withdrawal symptoms. Not applicable.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.759
The only side effects
I'm gonna have are

12:40.885 --> 12:42.845
some pain and 30 days of freedom.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.058
Am I the only one who's concerned
about a dying kid?

12:48.184 --> 12:50.561
If it's not lupus, what else?

12:50.687 --> 12:54.773
Most likely candidate for throwing
a clot is infection or cancer.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.650
I checked the biopsy twice.
It's not cancer.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.695
It's not an infection.
Gallium scan didn't reveal anything.

12:59.821 --> 13:02.448
Okay. What hides from a gallium scan?

13:06.870 --> 13:07.953
Cardiac.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.290
Right. Clot flicks off,
travels through the arteries

13:11.416 --> 13:13.959
and gets backed up in the eye.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.467
I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.885
What happened?

13:23.011 --> 13:25.554
It's an infection in his heart.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.930
Great.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.936
Echocardiogram for the heart and
IV antibiotics for the infection, stat.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.660
Is it my birthday?

13:50.914 --> 13:53.540
I'm not lonely. My leg hurts.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.833
She's a real masseuse.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.877
She's $500 an hour, minimum.

13:57.003 --> 14:00.380
She's hot, so she's a hooker?
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.132
The envious, jealous,

14:02.258 --> 14:04.676
I-never-got-any-in-high-school
kind of logic. Hello.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.387
She's a legitimate masseuse.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.847
Come on.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.267
God! She's beautiful.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.894
Because she's beautiful,
I should do it?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.562
What kind of pathetic logic is that?

14:15.688 --> 14:19.650
The envious, jealous, I'm-married-
and-l-can't-do-anything logic.

14:19.776 --> 14:20.734
Hello.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.028
Hi. Listen, I'm sure you're really good

14:23.154 --> 14:24.488
at whatever it is you do, but...

14:24.614 --> 14:25.781
Give me your hand.

14:25.907 --> 14:26.907
Huh?

14:28.159 --> 14:29.701
Hey, no, no. Let go of my hand.
Come on.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.245
She doesn't speak English.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.417
Ow!

14:46.719 --> 14:47.970
Oh, my God.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.768
Good.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.813
Take off your clothes.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.235
Not a fan of the stroganoff?

15:04.654 --> 15:05.862
I'm not hungry.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.657
Well, the antibiotics can cause nausea.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.450
So can the food.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.538
Shouldn't you be looking at my eye?

15:14.789 --> 15:17.165
The blood clot isn't life-threatening.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.752
We're focusing on figuring out
the cause of your problems.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.839
So the blindness will be permanent,
won't it?

15:41.316 --> 15:42.316
Thank you.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.650
Bye.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.946
I had a massage.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.198
Looks like you had a masseuse.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.325
Help the pain?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.451
I'm fine.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.577
I know.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.331
Kid's echo was normal, no sign of
any vegetations on heart valves.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.916
Never met a diagnostic study
I couldn't refute.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.877
And the antibiotics
aren't doing anything.

16:02.003 --> 16:05.422
So double the dosage.
Seventy milligrams.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.591
That'll box his kidneys for sure.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.134
You're right. Save the kidney.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.845
The guy we transplant it into
will be grateful.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.680
Also, I have an idea for his eye.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.849
Nothing we can do about his eye.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.809
- He's got a clot in the...
- Put it in a memo.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.227
If we remove some of the liquid

16:19.354 --> 16:20.979
from the eye itself,
the vitreous humor,

16:21.105 --> 16:24.733
it might make some extra room
around the retinal artery.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.779
If the artery expands,
the clot might move on its own.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.197
That's very creative.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.282
Why didn't you mention this before?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.576
I didn't think of it before.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.244
You should have.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.766
This is going to hurt.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.811
Your eye is numb.
You'll only feel pressure.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.840
Give it a minute.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.307
I can see.

18:08.671 --> 18:09.796
I can see you.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.466
I heard. Congratulations.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.635
Don't, I haven't brushed my teeth
in two days.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.937
I'm so scared they're not gonna find
out what's wrong with you.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.648
No biggie. I'm fine.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.444
I feel so bad about all this.
It's all my fault.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.655
No. No, it's not.

18:35.782 --> 18:39.075
But your father, he hates me.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.204
He's just pissed about his car.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.629
Help! Help! Help!

19:01.224 --> 19:02.265
What's wrong?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.184
AST is 859.
We're getting him to the ICU.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.312
ALT and GGT are in the tank.
Our antibiotics...

19:07.438 --> 19:08.772
Would not have caused this.

19:08.898 --> 19:09.898
She must have given him drugs!

19:10.024 --> 19:11.233
I wouldn't do that!

19:11.359 --> 19:12.776
It's not drugs!

19:13.361 --> 19:14.820
His liver is shutting down.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.405
What? What does that mean?

19:17.532 --> 19:19.950
It means he's all better.
He's ready to go home.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.077
- What?
- What do you think it means?

19:22.203 --> 19:24.371
You can't live without a liver.
He's dying.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.664
What is your problem?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.165
Bum leg. What's yours?

19:27.291 --> 19:30.210
Hey, we don't have time for this.
Let's go.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.884
His son's dying,
and you're mocking him?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.511
It was a dumb question.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.054
No, it wasn't.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.184
You're right. It wasn't.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.522
Is proving Cuddy wrong worth all this?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.580
You know,
House shouldn't even be here.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.165
Because he said something
inappropriate?

20:09.292 --> 20:12.335
If we sent him home every time he did
that, we wouldn't need this office.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.588
He's in pain.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.756
What does the man have to do
to piss you off?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.675
He's been without pain relief
for over 70 hours.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.635
Exactly! He's detoxing.

20:20.761 --> 20:22.554
Can't you see he's out of his mind?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.098
That's what they said about Manson.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.852
Do you want to continue
talking about me,

20:28.978 --> 20:32.105
or should we discuss
what the liver damage tells us?

20:33.983 --> 20:36.234
I was born in a log cabin
in Illinois...

20:36.360 --> 20:38.653
Hemolytic anemia doesn't cause
liver damage.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.572
Add the fact he's coughing blood,

20:40.698 --> 20:43.199
you've got three of the indicators of
organ-threatening lupus.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.118
It's moving too fast.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.663
Could be hepatitis E.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.625
There's only been one case of hep E
originating in the U.S. since...

20:51.751 --> 20:54.336
His history says he's been in and out
of the country

20:54.462 --> 20:55.754
four times in the last year.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.963
You really think he's got hep E?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.131
No.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.008
I think lupus is way more likely.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.928
All right, then let's start him
on IV Cytoxan and plasmapheresis.

21:03.054 --> 21:05.680
No, we should rule out hep E.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.057
You just said it wasn't hep E.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.850
I said lupus is way more likely,

21:08.976 --> 21:11.353
but if we treat for lupus
and it is hep E...

21:11.479 --> 21:12.437
He's toast.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.563
Exactly.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.357
But there isn't a treatment
for hepatitis E.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.650
Either he'll get better on his own

21:16.776 --> 21:18.818
or he'll continue to deteriorate.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.363
Yeah. I went to medical school, too.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.157
Start him on Solu-Medrol.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.534
If he's got hep E,
that's only gonna make him worse.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.119
Not as much.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.163
It's Goldilocks, people.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.165
Won't hurt him so much
that it'll kill him,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.501
and it won't hurt him so little
that we can't tell.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.795
It'll hurt him just right.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.880
And if it does nothing...

21:39.006 --> 21:41.633
We'll know it's not hep E,
and can start treating for the lupus.

21:41.759 --> 21:44.636
Now watch me do it
while drinking a glass of water.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.262
What do we tell the dad?

21:46.389 --> 21:49.391
"We think your kid has lupus, so we're
gonna treat him for hepatitis E.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.101
"And, oh, yeah, if it really is hep E,

21:51.227 --> 21:53.311
"we're not actually giving him
hep E medication.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.605
"So it's gonna make him worse,
not better."

21:55.731 --> 21:57.691
Do you think he'll go for that?

21:57.817 --> 21:58.775
So you want us to lie?

21:58.901 --> 22:01.403
No.
I want you to lie.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.779
Why me?

22:02.905 --> 22:04.739
Because he trusts you.

22:08.536 --> 22:09.577
This is a mistake.

22:09.704 --> 22:10.704
This is a lawsuit.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.623
Hep E is possible.
House always pulls these stunts,

22:13.749 --> 22:14.833
and he's right more often than not.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.210
He's delaying treatment because of
a one-in-a-million chance

22:17.336 --> 22:18.920
that even he doesn't think
is the problem.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.213
I don't want to lie to him.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.423
Then don't.

22:21.549 --> 22:22.549
And get fired?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.968
Like he's gonna fire you. He loves you.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.636
I've got to do something.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.555
Kid needs treatment.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.265
Treat him for lupus.

22:30.391 --> 22:32.392
That will get you fired.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.811
You really think House is losing it?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.188
Yeah.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.567
He's fine. He knows what he's doing.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.575
Okay.

23:41.128 --> 23:44.089
We're recommending a drug
called Solu-Medrol.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.466
For hepatitis?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.468
Did that show up on his blood tests?

23:49.887 --> 23:52.806
The tests are never 100% accurate.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.058
Well, then, all the other tests
could be wrong, too.

23:55.184 --> 23:58.269
This could still be
an infection or cancer.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.232
They don't fit any of
the most recent symptoms.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.818
Well, what, just hepatitis does?

24:05.653 --> 24:08.571
I know, I know,
I know you can never be sure.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.328
When Wendy was in the hospital,

24:16.330 --> 24:19.457
a doctor told us there was this
aggressive experimental treatment

24:19.583 --> 24:22.877
which might extend her life
by two or three years.

24:23.671 --> 24:25.547
Well, we figured
if there was any hope at all

24:25.673 --> 24:27.215
that we could have her with us
a little while longer,

24:27.341 --> 24:29.092
it'd be worth it.

24:29.385 --> 24:31.845
Three weeks later, she was gone.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.351
I don't think it's hepatitis.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.772
I think your son has lupus.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.859
I think it's broken.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.278
What did you do?

24:49.363 --> 24:52.282
Accidentally closed the car door on it.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.993
No. Door would've broken the skin.

24:55.119 --> 24:59.289
This looks like something hard
and smooth smashed it.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.999
I want my lawyer.

25:01.876 --> 25:04.002
The brain has
a gating mechanism for pain.

25:04.128 --> 25:07.797
Registers the most severe injury
and blocks out the others.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.340
Did it work?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.967
Well, my hand hurts like hell.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.846
Yeah. I feel much better.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.641
Don't splint it.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.269
I want to be able to bang it
against the wall

25:21.437 --> 25:23.688
if I need to administer another dose.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.356
Just tape it up.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.780
Why did you tell Cameron
to lie to Mr. Foster?

25:32.907 --> 25:34.365
Make it tight.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.783
Answer me.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.829
Nothing I can say is gonna change
how you feel,

25:40.831 --> 25:42.123
and nothing can come out of
your reaction

25:42.249 --> 25:43.750
that is gonna change what I plan to do,

25:43.876 --> 25:45.460
so I prefer to say nothing.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.087
So that was just you saying nothing.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.380
Uh-huh.

25:49.757 --> 25:51.007
The guy is furious.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.300
And scared.

25:52.426 --> 25:53.468
So what are you gonna do?

25:53.594 --> 25:55.678
The father's insisting on
the lupus treatment.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.474
Yeah, Cameron told me,
and I told her to tell him no.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.393
Well, you can't just sit back
and let the kid die.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.686
Neither can the father.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.896
So that's your plan?

26:05.022 --> 26:06.773
You're gonna play chicken
with the kid's life?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.817
Well, he's the dad.
I should win easily.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.153
Take the week off.

26:12.279 --> 26:14.572
Why, 'cause I lied to a patient?

26:14.698 --> 26:17.825
I take risks. Sometimes patients die.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.245
But not taking risks
causes more patients to die,

26:20.371 --> 26:21.788
so I guess my biggest problem is

26:21.914 --> 26:24.165
I've been cursed with the ability
to do the math.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.379
I told him that we wouldn't treat him
for the lupus until...

26:29.505 --> 26:31.005
What did he say?

26:31.131 --> 26:33.299
He said he wanted to transfer Keith
to another hospital.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.218
He's not stable enough.
He'd never make it through the door.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.511
That's what I told him.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.638
And that's when he caved.

26:38.764 --> 26:42.433
Yeah. He agreed to do it your way.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.353
Two plus two equals four.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.694
If it is hepatitis E,
we should see a marked decline

26:52.820 --> 26:54.570
in liver function tests
within the hour.

26:54.697 --> 26:55.780
Why bother explaining it to me?

26:55.906 --> 26:57.532
It's not like I have any choice
in the matter.

26:57.658 --> 27:00.368
If there's no hep E, we'll start
treatment for lupus immediately.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.703
Ouch!

27:01.829 --> 27:03.121
Keith? What's wrong?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.539
What's happening?

27:04.665 --> 27:06.291
No, get off.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.543
Keith, it's Dr. Chase.
Where does it hurt?

27:08.669 --> 27:09.627
Jules, no!

27:09.753 --> 27:10.753
He's hallucinating.

27:10.879 --> 27:11.838
Is this from the medicine?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.089
We haven't started the medicine.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.340
Keith, you're in the hospital.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.009
Keith, there's nothing on you.

27:16.135 --> 27:19.053
Keith! Keith! Keith!

27:19.179 --> 27:21.973
Hey. You okay, buddy?

27:28.230 --> 27:30.106
I think I wet the bed.

27:30.941 --> 27:34.235
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
Let's get you up.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.405
Oh, God!

27:37.531 --> 27:38.614
He's had a major bleed.

27:38.741 --> 27:39.949
Bright red blood, per rectum.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.660
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.829
He's going into hypovolemic shock.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.664
Pressure's 60, heart rate's 140.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.958
We need an angiography, stat!

27:58.761 --> 28:01.304
Angiography revealed
major upper and lower GI bleeding,

28:01.430 --> 28:04.223
severe hemodynamic compromise
and liver failure.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.850
He's also hallucinating.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.311
Thinks he's being tortured
by someone named Jules.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.146
Hallucinations are a symptom of
psychosis,

28:10.272 --> 28:11.898
which is
the fourth diagnostic criteria.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.442
It's official. This is lupus.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.444
Who's Jules?

28:17.821 --> 28:19.113
Any mention of her
in the medical history?

28:19.239 --> 28:21.115
It doesn't matter what
he's hallucinating about,

28:21.241 --> 28:23.659
it matters why! It's lupus.

28:23.786 --> 28:26.329
There's no need to get snippy.

28:26.455 --> 28:27.789
This kind of lupus takes years
to get to this point.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.041
- It's been a week.
- Yeah.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.876
And a 16-year-old kid shouldn't have
hemolytic anemia

28:32.002 --> 28:34.670
or be bleeding out of every orifice,
but he is.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.339
We had an opportunity to treat this.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.133
Instead, we diddled around with
hepatitis E, and now it's too late.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.053
He needs a new liver. We screwed up.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.723
You're saying I screwed up.

28:46.767 --> 28:47.600
Yes.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.227
Then why don't you just say that?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.021
You gonna blame this on her?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.649
Did you agree with my recommendation
to treat for hep E?

28:54.775 --> 28:55.733
No, I didn't.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.402
And she made herself quite clear.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.946
And then she went and lied to
the father. That's why you're angry.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.322
Yeah. I trusted you.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.367
You always trust me.
That's a big mistake.

29:05.369 --> 29:06.869
Lupus is a bad diagnosis.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.663
It's the best diagnosis we've got.

29:08.789 --> 29:09.872
That doesn't make it good.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.418
No. It just makes it this kid's
only chance to live.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.757
Put him on the transplant list.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.301
And make sure Cuddy knows.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.805
See if she can do anything
to get him close to the top.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.456
Cafeteria.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.624
Stay away from the sushi.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.961
And what happened to your hand?

29:57.087 --> 29:58.963
Got stuck in a drawer.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.423
Yeah, right.

30:00.549 --> 30:01.841
You're going through withdrawal.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.552
No, I am going through pain.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.221
Pain causes nausea.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.560
I took this job to work with you,
not cover your ass.

30:13.604 --> 30:14.979
Your Vicodin.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.652
And your solution is to give me drugs?

30:21.778 --> 30:23.988
- That's interesting.
- No.

30:24.114 --> 30:26.115
Now I'm covering my ass.

30:27.534 --> 30:30.328
Take your pills
before you kill this kid.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.620
Lupus is normally treated with
medication.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.830
But in Keith's case,
the disease is too advanced.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.499
Because you lied.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.835
Because House wanted to play games
with my son's life.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.087
There's no way to really tell

31:21.213 --> 31:22.588
what progression
the disease may have taken.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.090
You're right.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.760
And I'm sorry.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.014
So what do we do?

31:32.391 --> 31:34.183
He needs a new liver.

31:35.352 --> 31:38.604
There are over 15,000 patients
on the transplant list.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.607
But how many are about to bleed to
death unless they get a new liver?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.818
In Jersey? I'd say 20.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.780
Two thousand patients die each year
because a donor liver can't be found.

31:47.906 --> 31:48.948
That's almost five a day.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.866
So he's screwed.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.078
I'll see what I can do.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.956
Could I donate part of my liver?

31:57.082 --> 31:59.083
Sorry. You're a different blood type.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.501
So we just wait?

32:00.627 --> 32:01.794
I'm afraid so.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.797
And hope for someone to die.

32:07.217 --> 32:08.759
Who's Jules?

32:10.512 --> 32:11.887
Dr. House, you should get back
to your office.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.807
Jules. There's no Jules in the history.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.933
It was a hallucination.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.059
Of what?

32:17.185 --> 32:19.103
Our cat. Does this matter?

32:19.229 --> 32:20.271
No. I'm sorry.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.606
We'll continue the transfusions

32:21.732 --> 32:23.441
and the treatment for the anemia
and liver failure

32:23.567 --> 32:24.609
while we're waiting for a donor.

32:24.735 --> 32:25.860
How long can he wait?

32:26.153 --> 32:27.320
Not long.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.196
I don't think this is lupus.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.489
It's lupus. Come on, let's just...

32:30.616 --> 32:34.327
Your fourth diagnostic criterion for
lupus is psychosis.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.703
This is just a kid missing his cat.

32:35.829 --> 32:38.080
He was being attacked by an animal
that wasn't in the room.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.498
That's psychosis.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.876
There's a difference
between psychosis and hallucination.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.086
So if he was imagining a fake cat,
it'd be lupus,

32:44.212 --> 32:45.755
but since it was a real cat, it's not?

32:45.881 --> 32:46.881
Take your damn pills.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.007
Psychosis requires...

32:48.133 --> 32:49.925
There's no cat.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.762
Jules is dead.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.685
You have a dead family pet
and you never mentioned it?

33:00.687 --> 33:01.646
Nice family history.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.606
Family history is asking about
family members,

33:03.732 --> 33:05.608
meaning people related to the patient.
Let's go.

33:05.734 --> 33:06.901
How did the cat die?

33:07.027 --> 33:08.194
Can you get him out of here?

33:08.320 --> 33:09.445
Dr. House, come on.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.530
What happened to the cat?

33:13.033 --> 33:14.617
Old age.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.327
She was 15 years old.

33:16.453 --> 33:17.495
When?

33:17.746 --> 33:18.746
About a month ago.

33:18.872 --> 33:19.872
Does this have anything to do with...

33:19.998 --> 33:22.041
Where'd she sleep? With Keith.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.709
This is not a cat allergy.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.586
It's not lupus.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.838
Where is Jules?

33:32.969 --> 33:36.764
Four years of college,
four at med school,

33:36.890 --> 33:38.683
two years' residency,

33:38.809 --> 33:41.936
another four of subspecialty training,
and where do I end up?

33:43.313 --> 33:45.439
Talking instead of digging.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.983
Come on. The ground's frozen solid.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.912
What's that?

34:50.422 --> 34:51.881
Out of the way!

34:53.717 --> 34:56.051
We have the liver.
Prep OR 4.

35:21.995 --> 35:25.247
All right, Keith,
start counting backward from 10.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.416
Ten,

35:29.377 --> 35:30.544
nine,

35:31.338 --> 35:32.505
eight...

35:34.966 --> 35:36.300
Scalpel.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.182
Stop the gases.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.892
What the hell are you doing, House?

35:45.018 --> 35:48.729
Saving a 16-year-old kid from a
lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs

35:48.855 --> 35:50.731
and a very nasty scar.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.067
This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.027
He has acute naphthalene toxicity.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.153
Naphthalene?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.489
You're talking about mothballs.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.491
Nope. Termites.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.619
They create naphthalene
to protect their nests,

36:03.745 --> 36:05.788
which I'm assuming is rather large

36:05.914 --> 36:08.874
and inside all four walls of
his bedroom at home.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.711
And your assumption is based on what?

36:12.838 --> 36:15.881
The autopsy I just conducted
on his pet cat.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.633
Call Cuddy, and security.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.260
You are not removing that kid's liver.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.511
Now!

36:25.767 --> 36:27.643
Have you completely lost your mind?

36:27.769 --> 36:30.437
No, but I have been feeling
a little sick lately.

36:34.359 --> 36:37.570
There's no way we can do
this surgery now.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.654
You think?

36:38.780 --> 36:41.323
You've already cost him
his liver. Don't kill him, too.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.659
Why are you so eager
to cut into a healthy kid?

36:43.785 --> 36:45.452
Healthy? He's in the toilet.

36:45.579 --> 36:47.580
He just needs some chicken soup.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.914
I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.457
We're doing this transplant.

36:50.584 --> 36:51.542
No, you're not.

36:51.668 --> 36:52.668
You said it.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.336
If Keith's symptoms
had an environmental cause,

36:54.462 --> 36:56.088
they would have disappeared
as soon as he got here.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.214
They've only gotten worse.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.258
If the food here wasn't one step
below Rikers Island,

36:59.384 --> 37:01.302
he would've gotten better.
He's lost 14 pounds.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.762
Yeah, sure.
This is nothing but a dietary thing.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.724
Naphthalene is a gas,
a fat-soluble gas.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.602
Kid breathes it in,
it gets stored in his fat cells.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.897
Outside the hospital, his body burned
protein and carbs for energy,

37:13.023 --> 37:15.107
and the naphthalene stayed in fat.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.192
But once the car accident
put him in the hospital

37:17.319 --> 37:19.612
and he started losing weight,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.488
his body had to get its energy
somewhere else.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.532
It started to burn fat.

37:24.659 --> 37:28.662
The floodgates opened.
The poison poured into his system.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.040
So getting away from the poison is
what poisoned him?

37:31.166 --> 37:33.792
Getting away from his dad's meatloaf
is what's killing him.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.837
You want to explain to me
why you stopped the surgery?

37:36.963 --> 37:39.298
Oh, my God! My God.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.092
I want him locked up!

37:43.720 --> 37:45.346
Take it easy.

37:56.358 --> 37:59.401
Your cat did not die of old age.

38:02.322 --> 38:05.741
It died of massive internal bleeding
and acute liver failure

38:05.867 --> 38:08.327
caused by naphthalene poisoning.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.246
The exact same thing your son has.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.539
You lie to me,

38:12.666 --> 38:15.751
you mess up my son's surgery,
and now you expect me to trust you?

38:15.877 --> 38:18.837
Give me 24 hours.
We'll pump your son full of calories.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.965
That liver is going to
somebody right now.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.466
We're doing that surgery.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.510
You do the surgery,

38:24.886 --> 38:27.179
you'll be killing a mother of four.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.597
Father of three.

38:28.723 --> 38:29.682
I was guessing.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.016
Like you are now?

38:32.769 --> 38:35.187
Naphthalene poisoning is
the best explanation we have

38:35.313 --> 38:37.314
for what's wrong with your son.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.149
It explains the internal bleeding,

38:39.275 --> 38:40.901
the hemolytic anemia,
the liver failure.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.779
It also predicts what'll happen next.

38:43.905 --> 38:46.699
If you do the surgery, he's gonna lay
on that table for 14 hours

38:46.825 --> 38:48.659
while his body continues to burn fat

38:48.785 --> 38:50.953
and release poison into his system.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.457
Either way, I did you a favor.
He's awake now.

38:55.583 --> 38:58.043
You've got a chance to say good-bye.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.886
I think you should trust Dr. House.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.901
Give the liver to the other guy.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.792
Watch out.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.817
INR's down and his red count
is climbing.

40:06.446 --> 40:08.447
Means you made the right call.

40:08.573 --> 40:11.617
His liver's healing.
He's gonna be just fine.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.469
You made it a week.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.221
And won my prize.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.597
Congratulations.

40:33.723 --> 40:35.099
Cuddy's a sucker.

40:35.225 --> 40:36.767
I would've done it for two weeks off.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.852
Yeah, it was a piece of cake.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.938
You learn anything?

40:41.940 --> 40:43.107
Yeah.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.567
I'm an addict.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.790
Okay.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.668
I'm not stopping.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.339
There are programs.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.675
Cuddy would give you the time.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.552
You could get on a different
pain-management regimen.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.804
I don't need to stop.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.097
You just said...

41:15.223 --> 41:18.892
I said I was an addict.
I didn't say I had a problem.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.855
I pay my bills.
I make my meals. I function.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.858
Is that all you want?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.736
- You have no relationships.
- I don't want any relationships.

41:29.863 --> 41:31.155
You alienate people.

41:31.281 --> 41:33.198
I've been alienating people
since I was three.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.492
Come on! Drop it.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.453
You don't think you've changed
in the last few years?

41:38.580 --> 41:39.997
Well, of course I have.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.832
I've gotten older,
my hair's gotten thinner.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.584
Sometimes I'm bored.
Sometimes I'm lonely.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.294
Sometimes I wonder what it all means.

41:45.420 --> 41:46.879
No, I was there.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.840
You are not just a regular guy
who is getting older.

41:49.966 --> 41:53.302
You've changed. You're miserable,
and you're afraid to face yourself.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.345
Of course I've changed!

42:02.854 --> 42:04.938
And everything's the leg?

42:05.064 --> 42:06.732
Nothing's the pills?

42:06.858 --> 42:08.442
They haven't done a thing to you?

42:09.944 --> 42:11.820
They let me do my job.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.865
And they take away my pain.

42:46.731 --> 42:48.273
How'd it go?

42:49.317 --> 42:51.109
He admitted
he's addicted to the narcotics.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.611
Well, admitting
you have a problem is the...

42:52.737 --> 42:54.863
And he says it's not a problem.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.158
Maybe it's not.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.285
What do I know?

43:00.411 --> 43:01.828
What are you gonna do?

43:01.955 --> 43:03.830
Nothing. Done enough damage.

43:03.957 --> 43:06.416
Better hope he never finds out that
that was your idea.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.418
He'd never believe it.
