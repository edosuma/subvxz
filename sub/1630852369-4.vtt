- I mean, I'm going to
apologize

27:30.366 --> 27:33.250
again tonight
because I feel horribly.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.669
But you know, I've apologized
quite a bit at this point.

I can do.

27:41.510 --> 27:44.327
I had to apologize over
and over and over again.

27:44.347 --> 27:45.346
- I wish you had told me

27:45.381 --> 27:47.381
because I was waiting
till you guys got here.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.682
- I'm so sorry.

27:48.718 --> 27:50.333
That has never been
an intention.

27:50.353 --> 27:52.136
I'm sorry
that you feel that way.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.687
Heather, I've apologized,
and I've asked

27:53.723 --> 27:56.106
for your forgiveness.
Can you not forgive me for it?

27:56.142 --> 27:59.193
And it took a lot of work
to get past all of that,

27:59.228 --> 28:03.731

I'm back at square one.

35:40.355 --> 35:41.488
- Hi.

35:43.075 --> 35:45.342
- Shannon's here.
- Oh.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.410
Anyway, cheers to us.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.012
- Cheers to us.

35:49.047 --> 35:49.996
I love you.
- Thanks for having us.

35:50.032 --> 35:51.148
- You're awesome.
- You too.

35:51.183 --> 35:53.116
- We're going to go get a
drink, but congratulations.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.784
- Yeah, please,
thank you for coming.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.887
- I guess I should go--
- oh, I guess you should.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.488
- You're the host.
You go enjoy.

35:58.507 --> 36:00.123
- I should say hello.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.194
[pop]
- oh, did I hear a cork pop?

36:04.229 --> 36:06.179
Oh, that's good.
That's my favorite noise.

36:06.215 --> 36:08.048
- That's heather's calling.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.299
I'm just like,
"somebody see my name?"

36:09.334 --> 36:11.134
- right. Hello!
- Let me just tell you.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.802
I did work
in a restaurant once.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.204
- I'll have a little top-off.
- And I got a note.

36:14.239 --> 36:15.305
I got a note

36:15.340 --> 36:18.241
that I was the worst waitress
that they ever had.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.443
- I worked at a yogurt store.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.979
I was very generous, especially
when real skinny girls came in.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.949
I was like, oh, here.
Bbbblllbbb!

36:25.984 --> 36:27.367
- I want to apologize
to heather

36:27.402 --> 36:29.219
and try and have
a conversation with her.

36:29.254 --> 36:31.788
She didn't want to talk to me
or meet with me.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.324
- I need to talk to you too.
- About what?

36:34.359 --> 36:37.294
- About things I've heard
that you've said about me.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.547
- I said that to her after
the "promise" was broken.

36:40.582 --> 36:42.865
I said that
they couldn't be trusted.

36:42.885 --> 36:46.536
Absolutely. And let's look at
my history with emily and gina.

36:46.555 --> 36:50.924
<i> Last year, emily was told</i>
<i> a rumor about my boyfriend.</i>

36:50.976 --> 36:53.376
She talked to gina about it
and made that public.

36:53.395 --> 36:55.478
- Bronwyn asked me
how shannon and john were.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.265
She's like something about some
golf tournament or something.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.350
And like he was so drunk.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.452
Like his dad had to come
and take him.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.938
- They will talk about things
that hurt other people

37:04.990 --> 37:06.273
without even thinking of it

37:06.325 --> 37:08.358
because that's been  my .

37:08.393 --> 37:09.892
So I'm going
to warn my friends.

37:09.912 --> 37:11.077
- The thing that bothers me is

37:11.113 --> 37:12.895
I don't, like when you met
with heather,

37:12.915 --> 37:15.282
the only adjectives you used
to describe me to heather

37:15.334 --> 37:18.084
was untrustworthy
and manipulative.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.953
I thought we were friends,
shannon.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.289
- You know what,
I didn't say those words.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.406
I didn't say those words.

37:23.425 --> 37:24.407
- So you're saying
heather's a liar.

37:24.426 --> 37:25.542
- Ooh!
- We're not going to--

37:25.577 --> 37:27.911
you wanna do that right now?
- I just want to ask her.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.296
- Go ahead.
If you want to make it worse--

37:29.348 --> 37:31.047
- I'm not trying to make
anything worse. I'm just--

37:31.082 --> 37:32.966
- emily, all I said is

37:33.018 --> 37:34.134
you don't know
that she can be trusted.

37:34.186 --> 37:35.435
- But how did I get
brought into it?

37:35.470 --> 37:36.353
- I didn't say emily.
- But you said it

37:36.388 --> 37:38.021
about both of us.
- I really don't know

37:38.056 --> 37:39.889
if I did say it. No.
Okay. You know what emily,

37:39.925 --> 37:42.592
the fact that you're doing this
is really ----ed up.

37:42.611 --> 37:43.593
- Can you help me
with something?

37:43.629 --> 37:44.945
- Sure.

37:44.980 --> 37:45.929
- Are you kidding me right now?

37:45.964 --> 37:48.481
- What's happening?
- I'm not trying to--

37:48.533 --> 37:50.400
- I'm trying to have
a conversation with heather

37:50.435 --> 37:52.902
hopefully today.

38:00.194 --> 38:02.128
- Are you kidding me right now?

38:02.164 --> 38:04.130
I don't know what you guys
are doing right now.

38:04.165 --> 38:06.933
- I told shannon
that I was hurt because--

38:06.969 --> 38:09.135
- I thought we were not gonna--
- I know.

38:09.171 --> 38:10.570
- We're not. We're not,

38:10.605 --> 38:11.504
but I'm just gonna--I'm just
going to ask.

38:11.523 --> 38:12.939
'cause she said
that she didn't say that.

38:12.975 --> 38:14.674
- I said that they
couldn't be trusted.

38:14.710 --> 38:15.909
- Right. That's what I said.

38:15.944 --> 38:17.143
- But she said that you said

38:17.179 --> 38:19.562
that I said
that she was manipulative.

38:19.614 --> 38:20.847
I just said trusted,
that's all I said.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.565
- But even that,
let's just focus on that.

38:22.617 --> 38:24.150
You should know that by now.
- No, no. That's what you said.

38:24.186 --> 38:26.069
You said they are
not to be trusted.

38:26.121 --> 38:29.239
They are manipulative.
That is what you said to me.

38:31.159 --> 38:32.792
- Who does that?

38:32.828 --> 38:33.793
- You guys made a promise to me

38:33.829 --> 38:36.930
that it would never
be discussed in public.

38:40.252 --> 38:43.202
- I would love to have
a conversation with you, but--

38:43.221 --> 38:44.804
- that should have happened
like three weeks ago.

38:44.840 --> 38:45.805
- But there can't be
a conversation.

38:45.841 --> 38:47.040
There only can be
a conversation

38:47.075 --> 38:50.176
if we're not there. So--
- yeah, I agree.

38:50.212 --> 38:52.545
- Well, why don't you
all finish your conversation?

38:52.581 --> 38:54.247
And we can talk another time.

38:54.282 --> 38:57.684
- It's important for me
to have this conversation.

38:57.719 --> 38:58.718
So I'm going to.

38:58.754 --> 38:59.736
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.054
- We've met before. No?

39:01.073 --> 39:02.072
- Hi, how are you?

39:02.107 --> 39:04.774
- Oh, we met the other night.
Yes, I remember.

39:04.826 --> 39:06.926
- Good to see you.
- Dina.

39:06.962 --> 39:09.029
- Dina.
Nice to see you again.

39:09.064 --> 39:11.831
- I mean this 100%.

39:11.867 --> 39:14.000
If you need anything, if
you need someone to talk to--

39:14.036 --> 39:15.535
- I felt it.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.954
- If you need, and it's not
even like legal, like I--

39:18.006 --> 39:20.790
- she's a good person.
- I feel it.

39:20.842 --> 39:23.009
- Emily actually sent
amazing text messages,

39:23.045 --> 39:25.795
phone calls, support,
so much love.

39:25.847 --> 39:28.882
I'm so grateful.
I'm so appreciative.

39:28.917 --> 39:33.019
- As a woman and as a mother,
I feel a lot of sympathy

39:33.055 --> 39:36.806
and I feel compassion for her,
but also I feel very lucky

39:36.858 --> 39:39.142
<i> because shane and I</i>
<i> have had our ups and downs</i>

39:39.194 --> 39:40.977
and I didn't always know
what was going to happen,

39:41.029 --> 39:43.229
but I knew it was my choice.

39:43.265 --> 39:46.199
And for her, she didn't have
a choice. He left.

39:46.234 --> 39:48.568
I want you to know
when I wake up in the morning,

39:48.603 --> 39:49.936
you're the first thing
I think about.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.204
And when I go to bed at night,

39:51.239 --> 39:52.705
you're the first thing
I think about.

39:52.741 --> 39:53.873
- Can we please
have a conversation?

39:53.909 --> 39:55.274
- Sure.
- My conversation with you

39:55.293 --> 39:56.709
is the most important thing.

39:56.745 --> 39:58.277
It's all I've been
wanting to do. Actually--

39:58.296 --> 40:00.246
- can we not ruin
someone else's party?

40:00.281 --> 40:01.614
Let's just go somewhere quiet
that we can talk.

40:01.633 --> 40:02.916
- Okay.

40:02.951 --> 40:04.017
- Emily, shannon would like
to speak to me.

40:04.052 --> 40:05.618
And I'm fine talking to her.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.053
Where do you think
would be the appropriate spot--

40:07.089 --> 40:08.288
- there is a courtyard
over on this side.

40:08.323 --> 40:10.123
- Would you just show me?
- Yeah. I will.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.724
- I just don't want
to be disrespectful.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.026
- I get it.

40:13.061 --> 40:14.327
- By the way,
passing the california bar--

40:14.362 --> 40:16.596
he's a stud, right?
- Oh, yeah.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.314
- Hardest bar in the world.
- Not easy.

40:18.350 --> 40:20.316
- I'm the dumbest guy
in the world, so those two--

40:20.352 --> 40:22.152
- what're you talking about?
- I'm joking.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.020
- You know, I think
just out here.

40:24.072 --> 40:25.205
- Okay, great.
- Is that okay?

40:25.240 --> 40:26.639
- Yeah, of course. Thank you.
- Okay.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.608
- Thanks so much.

40:31.363 --> 40:32.946
- First of all,
I'd like to say,

40:32.981 --> 40:35.949
I didn't reach out
to you immediately

40:35.984 --> 40:38.334
because you didn't want
to accept my apology.

40:38.370 --> 40:41.254
You said that to me that night,
but my friendship with you

40:41.289 --> 40:44.824
means something to me,
and I care about you and terry,

40:44.843 --> 40:48.344
and I'm the dumb sh--
that didn't think.

40:48.380 --> 40:51.764
And in that--in the interim,
I hurt my friend

40:51.800 --> 40:56.335
and I never wanted to do that,
and I'm so, so sorry.

40:56.354 --> 40:58.671
And I hope that you can accept
my apology and over time,

40:58.690 --> 41:00.273
forgive me.
What I did was wrong.

41:00.308 --> 41:03.276
And it's not me.
I don't wanna hurt people.

41:03.311 --> 41:07.180
I certainly don't--I'm not
a gossip and I've hurt you,

41:07.215 --> 41:11.367
and I-I want to do whatever
I can to make it up to you.

41:11.403 --> 41:13.219
I feel horrible.

41:15.123 --> 41:16.789
- My turn?
- Mm-hmm.

41:21.997 --> 41:23.913
- I have heard from everyone.

41:23.965 --> 41:27.083
I feel like I have a good
understanding of the facts,

41:27.135 --> 41:32.005
and nothing that you say
with the details

41:32.040 --> 41:33.806
is going to change my mind
about--wait.

41:33.842 --> 41:36.259
Just let me finish.
- It's fine.

41:36.311 --> 41:39.179
- I think you had a huge lapse
in judgment,

41:39.214 --> 41:42.015
and I'm going to say this and
I'm sorry if this sounds harsh,

41:42.050 --> 41:44.017
but this is how I feel.

41:44.052 --> 41:50.389
If you ever come after me
or my family ever again,

41:50.408 --> 41:56.162
you are going to lose a lot
more than just my friendship.

41:56.198 --> 41:58.198
This will cost a lot.

41:58.233 --> 42:00.366
And I'm not saying this
as a threat.

42:00.401 --> 42:02.202
I'm saying it as a promise.

42:05.073 --> 42:08.208
<i> - Next time on...</i>

42:10.845 --> 42:13.112
- Oh! Oh!

42:13.148 --> 42:16.816
- Go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go.

42:16.851 --> 42:18.952
- Aah!

42:18.987 --> 42:20.453
- I love that you brought
a louis vuitton.

42:20.488 --> 42:23.439
- Filled with cheese.
- I don't know. It's amazing.

42:23.475 --> 42:25.959
- You know, girls, after when
you're all gone,

42:25.994 --> 42:28.311
your mother and me
finally said, "well, dad,

42:28.363 --> 42:30.446
"I'm only a mile away.

42:30.482 --> 42:33.166
We'll spend more time
together."

42:33.201 --> 42:38.404
- that jeniffer. Girl, bye.
I can't really be around that.

42:38.439 --> 42:41.440
- Is there something I've done
to you that has upset you?

42:41.459 --> 42:43.243
- You're a little thirsty.

42:43.278 --> 42:44.794
- I'm just thinking, like,

42:44.829 --> 42:47.280
let's get this girl
some lemonade.

42:47.299 --> 42:49.182
- Wanna know
what's going on with noella.

42:49.217 --> 42:50.250
- In the year
that I've known her,

42:50.285 --> 42:53.052
like "we got married
and then we're not married."

42:53.088 --> 42:55.221
are we all buying this story?

42:55.257 --> 42:58.791
- I talked to noella yesterday.
- What did she say?

42:58.810 --> 43:01.060
- She was just basically
warning me

43:01.096 --> 43:03.263
to be careful of you.
