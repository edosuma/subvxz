00:39.107 --> 00:47.107
â™ª

01:29.323 --> 01:30.523
It takes a special breed to

01:30.524 --> 01:32.359
live in a province like Quebec.

01:32.360 --> 01:40.360
It gets cold in winter,
and winters are long.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.336
It takes a special kind of

01:43.337 --> 01:46.206
person for whom frozen rivers,

01:46.207 --> 01:49.008
icy, wind whipped streets, deep,

01:49.009 --> 01:53.480
seemingly endless
forests are the norm.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.516
I will confess my
partisanship up front.

01:56.517 --> 01:57.517
I love Montreal.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.719
It is my favorite
place in Canada.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.324
The people who live there are

02:04.325 --> 02:07.160
tough, crazy people and
I admire them for it.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.330
Toronto, Vancouver, I love
you but not like Montreal.

02:10.330 --> 02:10.663
Why?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.365
I shall explain.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.367
All will be revealed.

02:14.368 --> 02:19.739
In the meantime,
check this guy out.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.541
What is the post office motto?

02:21.542 --> 02:25.245
Neither rain nor sleet nor
driving snow nor plague of

02:25.246 --> 02:28.848
locusts prevent the mail carrier

02:28.849 --> 02:30.016
from delivering junk mail?

02:30.017 --> 02:31.418
Here in Montreal the simple task

02:31.419 --> 02:33.085
of delivering the mail in winter

02:33.086 --> 02:37.524
comes with its own
set of hurdles.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.392
Icy hurdles.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.360
I got to ask.

02:39.361 --> 02:42.295
You have special
equipment for this?

02:42.296 --> 02:43.796
We got to like slip on boots?

02:43.797 --> 02:49.636
We do have boots when it gets
icy with spikes on them.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.938
And they give us also slip on

02:51.939 --> 02:56.576
spikes for when it's icy.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.110
Any sort of city ordinance

02:58.111 --> 03:01.314
that you have to shovel if...

03:01.315 --> 03:02.815
Not penalized financially snnchs...

03:02.816 --> 03:03.551
No, nothing like that.

03:03.552 --> 03:06.386
Any injuries in
the line of duty?

03:06.387 --> 03:10.089
I had several incidents.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.157
I broke my ankle.

03:11.158 --> 03:14.627
What is the most perilous
aspect of the job?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.829
Dogs or icy stairs?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.898
In this area there's a lot of

03:18.899 --> 03:26.899
dogs but also icy stairs.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.113
It's one thing have to work

03:34.114 --> 03:35.415
outside in this wintry mess but

03:35.416 --> 03:37.284
takes a strange and wonderful

03:37.285 --> 03:38.818
kind of mutant to actually find

03:38.819 --> 03:43.456
it pleasurable like, well,
these two gentlemen.

03:43.457 --> 03:47.427
Do you like the cold?

03:47.428 --> 03:50.530
I mean... it cleans
the streets of Ebola.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.299
The cold.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.532
The frigid cold keeps the

03:52.533 --> 03:57.637
riff raff out of
the city for sure.

03:57.638 --> 04:04.176
Fred and David, chefs at
the legendary Joe beef.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.179
Historians of their beloved
great white north.

04:07.180 --> 04:12.352
Princes of hospitality.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.953
And what do men like this do for

04:13.954 --> 04:18.725
fun when the rivers turn to ice?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.827
When testicles shrink and most

04:20.827 --> 04:23.363
of us scurry for
warmth and shelter?

04:23.364 --> 04:24.497
If like so many other Canadians

04:24.498 --> 04:27.400
they would go ice fishing on the St.
Lawrence fever.

04:27.401 --> 04:31.338
The cabin fever in the family
because we are confined,

04:31.339 --> 04:32.872
perhaps, to spend so much time

04:32.873 --> 04:36.343
indoors a lot of the families

04:36.344 --> 04:38.378
love to do activities together

04:38.379 --> 04:40.613
like go to the cottage,
go ice fishing.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.315
It's like get you
out of the house.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.351
It's very much a family thing.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.152
Like many of their ilk they'd

04:46.153 --> 04:50.490
seek one of the temporary, small

04:50.491 --> 04:53.225
towns of sled borne cabins,

04:53.226 --> 04:54.894
drill a hole in the
ice, and wait.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.529
But these are not normal men.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.831
So is Quebec better than
the rest of Canada?

04:58.832 --> 04:59.767
Obviously.

04:59.767 --> 05:00.501
Not bad.

05:00.502 --> 05:01.601
Come on.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.337
I mean, you didn't have
to think about that long.

05:04.338 --> 05:04.605
No.

05:04.606 --> 05:05.672
Wait a minute.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.006
Are strippers paid hourly here?

05:07.007 --> 05:11.277
Is that right?

05:11.278 --> 05:14.213
It is considered an
art, a performance art.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.248
So how does that work?

05:16.249 --> 05:18.217
You don't tip a stripper?

05:18.218 --> 05:19.386
You pay per song.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.520
You pay per song.

05:20.521 --> 05:26.192
Then you can get a
dance in the back.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.394
Which is a private dance.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.261
Ten bucks a song.

05:28.262 --> 05:29.729
Five bucks a song in public.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.265
That's why I go there because

05:33.266 --> 05:35.267
their songs are super long
and I am a bit cheap.

05:35.268 --> 05:41.874
I go for the lap dance.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.643
After a suspiciously stunned

05:43.644 --> 05:47.647
fish emerges from the
deep it is ignored.

05:47.648 --> 05:54.454
Because Fred and Dave
do things differently.

05:54.455 --> 05:56.589
No crude fried fish and
bread crumbs for these men.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.425
Oh, wow.

05:57.426 --> 06:04.096
Look at that.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.165
Instead a hearty lunch of French

06:06.166 --> 06:07.400
classics accompanied by fine

06:07.401 --> 06:10.169
wines and liquers as befitting

06:10.170 --> 06:11.471
gentlemen of discerning taste

06:11.472 --> 06:13.305
who have exhausted
themselves in the wild.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.975
So this is how you live?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.444
Well, more often than not, yes.

06:17.445 --> 06:22.482
We always have to travel
well and eat properly.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.950
White burgundy.

06:23.951 --> 06:28.855
Glacier bay oysters as
well as thrown in there

06:28.856 --> 06:29.189
delicious.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.958
My prized possession.

06:31.959 --> 06:39.632
The funnest part is the cutlery.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.635
Fred has a wonderful
collection of table ware.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.837
Without getting snobby or

06:44.838 --> 06:46.973
elitist eating off vintage table

06:46.974 --> 06:48.608
ware is one of the
great Joyce in life.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.844
This is the interesting paradox.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.147
You aspire to run a Democratic

06:55.148 --> 06:57.383
establishment and yet you are

06:57.384 --> 06:59.652
hopeless romantics when it

06:59.653 --> 07:07.653
comes to painful nostalgics
the art of living, right?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.064
Sustenance is required like say

07:12.065 --> 07:15.568
a comsumme of ox tail to begin

07:15.569 --> 07:16.537
followed by chilled lobster.

07:16.538 --> 07:20.372
The art of dining is
disappearing much to our

07:20.373 --> 07:20.674
chagrin.

07:20.675 --> 07:22.642
I work super hard at being an

07:22.643 --> 07:26.713
excellent dining companion.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.914
When seeking excellence in a

07:27.915 --> 07:30.216
dining companion what
qualities does one look for?

07:30.217 --> 07:32.885
I turn my phone off, you know?

07:32.886 --> 07:35.522
I never put my
elbows on the table.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.223
Of course.

07:36.224 --> 07:38.324
Come prepared with stories.

07:38.325 --> 07:39.192
Don't drink too much.

07:39.193 --> 07:42.028
Don't become sloppy.

07:42.029 --> 07:42.663
Come prepared.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.597
Absolutely.

07:43.598 --> 07:45.064
No elbows on the table?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.533
No.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.434
It's not proper.

07:47.435 --> 07:51.003
I am a total failure
as a dining companion.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.872
What is that?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.607
What's that, you ask?

07:54.608 --> 07:59.846
An iconic classic of gastronomy?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.413
Look at that sauce.

08:01.414 --> 08:01.882
Holy crap.

08:01.883 --> 08:04.517
The devilishly difficult dish.

08:04.518 --> 08:09.421
A boneless, wild hare in a sauce

08:09.422 --> 08:13.560
of its own blood, truffle,
garnished with thick slabs

08:13.561 --> 08:18.598
seared directly on the top
of the cabin's wood stove.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.567
Look at that.

08:20.568 --> 08:26.072
We're in a wooden shack,
over three feet of ice.

08:26.073 --> 08:30.943
You are hopeless romantics, gentlemen.

08:30.944 --> 08:35.715
Oh, look at that.

08:35.716 --> 08:43.716
The dish is perch atop
an etherial dish.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.394
This is from the vineyard.

08:48.395 --> 08:48.929
Nice.

08:48.929 --> 08:49.262
Wonderful.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.998
Yes, yes it is.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.265
Really.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.401
Is there a billionaire or despot

08:55.402 --> 08:56.669
pot anywhere on earth who at

08:56.670 --> 08:58.805
this precise moment is
eating better than us?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.640
No.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.641
No.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.811
Look at that.

09:04.812 --> 09:05.278
Cheese.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.813
There must be cheese.

09:06.814 --> 09:12.251
In this case a voluptuously

09:12.252 --> 09:14.020
filled dish which some less

09:14.021 --> 09:16.756
hearty outdoorsmen might
call over ripe but not us.

09:16.757 --> 09:19.959
This is awesome.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.260
Here.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.094
A few Cubans.

09:21.095 --> 09:24.697
You guys have a much more
relaxed attitude toward the

09:24.698 --> 09:29.602
importation of Cuban cigars.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.371
Chartreuse of course and a
dessert as rare as it gets.

09:32.372 --> 09:37.276
A dinosaur era monster
long believed extinct.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.346
This is ghetto... who does this?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.981
No one fries it is one of

09:41.982 --> 09:44.316
those, like, painful,
nostalgic things.

09:44.317 --> 09:44.652
Right.

09:44.653 --> 09:48.454
Layers of almond and hazelnut

09:48.455 --> 09:49.722
meringue, chocolate
butter cream.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.691
Look at that!

09:51.692 --> 09:53.525
That was good.

09:53.526 --> 09:56.629
For these guys, this is normal.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.797
This is lunch.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.666
Some days it's like play

09:59.667 --> 10:01.467
house in my house,
French play house.

10:01.468 --> 10:01.802
Yeah?

10:01.802 --> 10:02.670
What do you do?

10:02.671 --> 10:03.903
Get dressed at their house.

10:03.904 --> 10:04.672
No way.

10:04.673 --> 10:05.805
Tell me about it.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.806
The kids, too.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.374
He's a dandy.

10:08.375 --> 10:09.342
A Sunday dandy.

10:09.343 --> 10:17.343
Last time I did I made salad la

10:22.522 --> 10:24.190
orange, and then a huge cheese

10:24.191 --> 10:26.826
Kurd about like 15
kurds of cheese.

10:26.827 --> 10:27.394
Right.

10:27.395 --> 10:29.161
And how many people
are in your family?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.830
Him and his wife and
two young boys.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.531
Right.

10:31.532 --> 10:32.765
How many kids?

10:32.766 --> 10:36.035
So you, your wife, and a
2-year-old and a 4-year-old.

10:36.036 --> 10:39.839
They don't make it to the end

10:39.840 --> 10:44.043
usually until
prematurely opened.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.879
I'm thinking that's... I'm also

10:46.880 --> 10:47.947
thinking I have to do that.

10:47.948 --> 10:55.948
Actually my daughter would
totally be into it.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.706
Once every so often a
nation will produce a hero.

11:13.707 --> 11:14.941
Someone who changes everything

11:14.942 --> 11:17.744
about their chosen field, who

11:17.745 --> 11:19.779
changes the whole landscape,

11:19.780 --> 11:26.385
life after them is
never the same.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.788
This is such a man.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.991
A here to foreunencountered

11:31.992 --> 11:33.425
rugged outdoorsman, veteran chef

11:33.426 --> 11:35.928
with many years of fine
dining experience.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.897
Renegade, innovator, one of the

11:37.898 --> 11:41.400
most influential chefs
in north America.

11:41.401 --> 11:45.772
He is also a proud Quebec wa and

11:45.773 --> 11:46.740
perhaps he more than anyone else

11:46.741 --> 11:48.574
is define for a new generation

11:48.575 --> 11:51.811
of Americans and Canadians
what that means.

11:51.812 --> 11:55.782
He is an unlikely ambassador for

11:55.783 --> 11:58.317
his country and his province but

11:58.318 --> 11:59.618
maybe not so unlikely.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.788
I mean, look at him.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.789
Out for a day trapping beaver

12:02.790 --> 12:09.929
with a local trapper, Carl.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.330
So the bait is wood?

12:11.331 --> 12:11.965
Yeah.

12:11.965 --> 12:12.699
Just the bark.

12:12.699 --> 12:13.533
They eat the bark.

12:13.534 --> 12:15.201
Yeah, yeah.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.669
In pioneer days beaver was

12:17.670 --> 12:19.605
the financial engine of Canada.

12:19.606 --> 12:19.973
Yeah.

12:19.974 --> 12:22.842
Empires were built on it.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.976
Every hat practically in the

12:23.977 --> 12:25.511
world was made of a bever pelt.

12:25.512 --> 12:32.819
That's why today it is
the icon of Canada.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.788
To a lesser extent the
tradition continues today.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.156
Carl continues to trap usually

12:37.157 --> 12:38.657
called on by provision officials

12:38.658 --> 12:40.860
to track beaver and clear away

12:40.861 --> 12:42.061
dams and control what could

12:42.062 --> 12:47.666
become a destructively
overpopulated situation.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.501
Hello, my little friend.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.470
This is a young one.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.239
Those are the one
we want to eat.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.207
What will you compare
the meat to?

12:55.208 --> 12:56.909
Is there anything like it?

12:56.910 --> 12:57.845
That's the thing.

12:57.846 --> 12:58.978
There is nothing.

12:58.979 --> 13:06.979
Nothing like it. When you
eat beaver it's beaver.

13:07.254 --> 13:13.225
Along with an encyclopedia
knowledge of fine wines and

13:13.226 --> 13:15.027
attachment to the music of

13:15.028 --> 13:16.362
Celine Dion he is a big believer

13:16.363 --> 13:19.231
in honoring history
and tradition.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.499
If you still trap beavers you

13:20.500 --> 13:23.669
should if at all possible
cook them and eat them.

13:23.670 --> 13:27.606
Not just strip them
of their pellets.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.675
As incredible as it might seem

13:29.676 --> 13:33.745
you can cook beaver
really, really well.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.047
Beaver tail on the other hand is

13:35.048 --> 13:37.716
not actually beaver at all.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.052
Rather, a quick spoon bread type

13:40.053 --> 13:41.687
of thing that in our case goes

13:41.688 --> 13:49.688
somewhat awry during an
inadvertent inferno.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.934
The sauce almost looks like

13:54.935 --> 13:56.135
chocolate it is so rich looking.

13:56.136 --> 13:56.937
I love it.

13:56.937 --> 13:57.905
When it is like that.

13:57.906 --> 13:59.138
Some people don't put too much

13:59.139 --> 14:04.110
blood but I like when
it is very thick.

14:04.111 --> 14:04.444
Wow.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.112
Absolutely delicious.

14:05.112 --> 14:05.745
It is.

14:05.746 --> 14:10.216
I wasn't joking about it.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.318
It doesn't taste
like chicken at all.

14:12.319 --> 14:18.124
This is your first time.

14:18.125 --> 14:18.325
Wow.

14:18.326 --> 14:20.326
Something I think you
almost eat everything.

14:20.327 --> 14:20.961
Yeah.

14:20.962 --> 14:22.561
At this point, you know, animals

14:22.562 --> 14:28.434
see me and they're like, ah.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.768
That guy.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.003
There is a joke around here

14:31.004 --> 14:32.138
somewhere but to tell you the

14:32.139 --> 14:40.139
truth the stuff
is just too good.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.119
It's like ten below zero
in this freaking town.

14:47.120 --> 14:52.158
That generally does not
spell good times for me.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.993
A good time for me is more like

14:53.994 --> 14:57.930
a palm tree, a beach, a swimming

14:57.931 --> 15:05.931
pool, but the only
cold thing is my beer.

15:06.273 --> 15:06.873
But no.

15:06.874 --> 15:08.607
They like to frolic
in the snow and ice.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.310
More accurately, they like to

15:11.311 --> 15:14.613
obey their genetic imperative to

15:14.614 --> 15:19.185
risk dental and facial injury by

15:19.186 --> 15:20.552
skating around slapping at a

15:20.553 --> 15:22.521
hard disk trying to drive it in

15:22.522 --> 15:25.057
each other's general direction.

15:25.058 --> 15:30.696
I believe they call
this sport hockey.

15:30.697 --> 15:34.033
This is not in my blood.

15:34.034 --> 15:34.567
You skate?

15:34.568 --> 15:36.668
We grew up on this.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.669
Everyone in Quebec?

15:37.670 --> 15:38.371
What else?

15:38.372 --> 15:41.573
There is no reason to live
here if there is no hockey.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.411
Hockey rinks pop up all over
the city to accommodate

15:45.412 --> 15:48.480
Montrealers' desire to risk
teeth, groin, and limb.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.682
Right behind Fred and Dave's

15:50.683 --> 15:54.686
restaurant Joe beef a pickup
game of chefs, cooks, and

15:54.687 --> 15:56.222
hospitality professionals
is under way.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.658
Some of these guys have looked

15:59.659 --> 16:00.892
to be a little long in the tooth

16:00.893 --> 16:03.329
to be out there swinging sticks

16:03.330 --> 16:05.164
at each other skidding
around on the ice.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.398
This is normal behavior?

16:06.399 --> 16:07.234
People actual dye this?

16:07.234 --> 16:08.201
Absolutely.

16:08.202 --> 16:10.769
This is every day growing
up playing hockey.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.004
Canadian national sport, man.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.674
This young one is already
being indoctrinated.

16:15.675 --> 16:16.176
Hello, young man.

16:16.177 --> 16:18.344
You going to play hockey?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.013
Are you going to be a
goalie or a player?

16:21.014 --> 16:21.781
A player.

16:21.781 --> 16:22.182
Wow.

16:22.183 --> 16:24.783
A player.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.917
Oh, man.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.419
Am I going to get like a mouth

16:27.420 --> 16:32.191
full of puck by the way?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.193
It's being catered with Fred

16:34.194 --> 16:38.530
and Dave's usual restraint.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.032
Come eat.

16:40.033 --> 16:44.603
Hot coco in Styrofoam cups?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.938
No.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.808
Try a Titanic containing

16:49.809 --> 16:52.211
flintstone sized hunks of pork

16:52.212 --> 17:00.212
belly, bacon, home made
portions, smoked chops, plus

17:00.253 --> 17:01.420
veal and pork links.

17:01.421 --> 17:02.788
Oh, yeah.

17:02.789 --> 17:07.093
This is a truly heroic dish.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.229
Look at the beautiful work.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.263
Awesome.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.333
This is the single best argument

17:14.334 --> 17:17.736
for sharing a border
with Germany.

17:17.737 --> 17:22.441
And of course the finest
wines known to humanity.

17:22.442 --> 17:28.314
German wine, pirate bottles.

17:28.315 --> 17:28.581
Sweet.

17:28.582 --> 17:30.982
What am I drinking?

17:30.983 --> 17:31.684
Canadian.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.919
This is Norman Hardy from prince

17:33.920 --> 17:36.655
Edward county five
hours from here.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.290
Amazing wine.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.259
Here's an allegory
here somewhere.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.628
I'm reaching for it.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.029
Something about friend days,

17:44.030 --> 17:46.432
reckless abandon coupled with
precision and technique.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.799
A hockey metaphor perhaps.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.135
The hell with it.

17:49.136 --> 17:52.171
Look.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.107
Sausages.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.727
Montreal to Quebec city by rail.

18:15.728 --> 18:23.728
160 miles of wintry vistas
whipped past the windows,

18:24.671 --> 18:26.572
evocative for some
of another time.

18:26.573 --> 18:29.241
Sturgeon and caviar.

18:29.242 --> 18:33.245
I'm not sure about Dave
McMillan but in Fred's perfect

18:33.246 --> 18:36.248
world we would all
travel by rail.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.984
It would still be the
golden age of rail travel.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.320
So tell me about the great
Canadian rail system.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.754
It's purely emotional.

18:42.755 --> 18:43.690
Really?

18:43.691 --> 18:44.923
Nothing rational about it.

18:44.924 --> 18:50.362
Fred is what one might call
conservatively an expert.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.664
How extreme is your
railroad nerdism?

18:52.665 --> 18:54.433
This is how bad it gets.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.202
Operating manual.

18:55.203 --> 18:56.203
This model train.

18:56.203 --> 18:56.736
Yeah.

18:56.737 --> 19:00.839
So you have other operations.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.708
Yeah.

19:01.709 --> 19:05.777
Books, printed
information, collectibles.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.346
An enduring love for the great

19:07.347 --> 19:08.614
iron horses that still take

19:08.615 --> 19:12.050
passengers across the
frozen land he calls home.

19:12.051 --> 19:15.120
But it is something more
than just nostalgia.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.690
It's also an appreciation
for a dying art.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.527
It's like the old cruise ships.

19:21.528 --> 19:25.264
You transport your comfort.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.200
You know?

19:28.201 --> 19:31.770
For those days of cross country
rail there were lavish

19:31.771 --> 19:34.039
dining cars, luxurious sleeping

19:34.040 --> 19:37.276
compartments, a bar
car with attendants.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.311
We look at the menus of how

19:39.312 --> 19:40.546
people would eat on trains.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.914
It was inspiration of how
we cook in the restaurant.

19:42.915 --> 19:46.452
All the sweet breads and
fresh peas, leg of lamb.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.287
Current jelly.

19:47.288 --> 19:49.455
Very nice pictures in the
dining by train book.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.657
The guy holding the Turkey
and cutting the Turkey.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.124
Right.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.092
You order a drink.

19:53.093 --> 19:54.326
It comes from a bottle made out

19:54.327 --> 19:57.229
of glass into a glass
made out of glass right.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.398
Which is kind of cool
in our day and age.

19:59.399 --> 20:02.668
It goes back to
service doesn't it?

20:02.669 --> 20:03.135
Thank you.

20:03.136 --> 20:06.305
We are presented with a
perfectly serviceable omlete.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.074
There may no longer be a smoking

20:09.075 --> 20:11.443
lounge with brass spitoons but

20:11.444 --> 20:13.812
this does not mean a
traveler has to suffer.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.081
You always travel
with a truffle?

20:16.082 --> 20:19.017
As a gentleman must.

20:19.018 --> 20:19.419
Wait a minute.

20:19.420 --> 20:22.187
I got to get an action
photograph here.

20:22.188 --> 20:22.622
Canadian rail.

20:22.623 --> 20:25.090
All these people are going to be

20:25.091 --> 20:26.658
expecting... wait a minute.

20:26.659 --> 20:27.659
Where is my truffle?

20:27.660 --> 20:30.696
Can I have the truffle
option please?

20:30.697 --> 20:33.365
Oh, of course.

20:33.366 --> 20:41.340
Don't forget the flop.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.208
Quebec city.

20:42.209 --> 20:44.142
One of the oldest European

20:44.143 --> 20:52.143
settlements in north America.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.521
Samuel Dechanplain sailed up the

20:55.522 --> 20:57.889
Saint Lurns and founded
the site in 1608.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.358
When the fighting started with

20:59.359 --> 21:01.159
you know who Quebec city was the

21:01.160 --> 21:02.328
French stronghold until the

21:02.329 --> 21:04.496
bitter end when the French fell

21:04.497 --> 21:12.497
at the plains of Abraham.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.542
The French may have lost that

21:16.543 --> 21:22.381
one but some things French
have stayed firm, unbowed,

21:22.382 --> 21:26.518
resiliently unchanged
by trends or history.

21:26.519 --> 21:30.255
The continental is the kind
of place about which I am

21:30.256 --> 21:33.492
unreservedly sentimental.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.394
When I was younger I ate here

21:35.395 --> 21:37.195
with my grandparents
and parents.

21:37.196 --> 21:39.531
The best restaurant in town.

21:39.532 --> 21:42.368
Classic.

21:42.369 --> 21:45.103
Unironic cuisine, meaning dishes

21:45.104 --> 21:50.742
you haven't seen
since, like, forever.

21:50.743 --> 21:55.581
Fresh, continental, ocean liner

21:55.582 --> 21:57.416
classics such as... Ceasar

21:57.417 --> 21:58.950
salad, tossed fresh to order.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.386
Table side.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.588
And beef char char also prepared

22:02.589 --> 22:08.527
table side as one must.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.362
Shrimp cocktail.

22:10.363 --> 22:14.065
A shrimp cocktail the way
Jesus wants you to eat them.

22:14.066 --> 22:19.037
All served by a
dedicated professional.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.039
In culinary school
we were taught this.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.208
Real customers is
your final class.

22:23.209 --> 22:26.211
We'd have to do the fruits,

22:26.212 --> 22:26.979
table side, all that which would

22:26.980 --> 22:28.747
fly off the fork and
land in somebody's soup.

22:28.748 --> 22:29.416
I was so bad.

22:29.417 --> 22:30.449
Start with the orange.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.550
Run into trouble.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.052
I'll be right back.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.587
Bite with my teeth.

22:35.588 --> 22:36.456
Stripping the thing.

22:36.457 --> 22:38.156
At least once a day.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.591
One of the students would set

22:39.592 --> 22:44.095
themselves or the
customers on fire.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.398
The inferno would spill
and they'd light it.

22:46.399 --> 22:47.266
There would be this line from

22:47.267 --> 22:50.736
the thing down across
the floor up their leg.

22:50.737 --> 22:50.937
No.

22:50.938 --> 22:52.137
That doesn't happen here.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.939
Like I said, professionals.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.975
This is going to go
like a big fire ball.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.009
Fire ball.

22:58.010 --> 22:58.277
Good.

22:58.278 --> 22:59.478
The kind who know how to

22:59.479 --> 23:06.117
properly prepare these dishes.

23:06.118 --> 23:06.453
Sweet.

23:06.454 --> 23:08.520
Like a goose bump moment.

23:08.521 --> 23:08.788
Yeah.

23:08.789 --> 23:13.759
For Dave, another classic.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.262
A sauce made of cognac, cream.

23:17.263 --> 23:17.964
That is nice.

23:17.965 --> 23:20.265
Look at that.

23:20.266 --> 23:28.266
And for Fred, scampi Newberg.

23:28.975 --> 23:29.476
Awesome.

23:29.476 --> 23:30.276
Absolutely awesome.

23:30.277 --> 23:34.546
For me, that most noble
of dishes, Dover sole.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.381
This appears to be one of the

23:36.382 --> 23:37.649
few remaining servers alive who

23:37.650 --> 23:38.984
knows how to take that fish off

23:38.985 --> 23:46.124
the bone, sauce it, and
properly serve it.

23:46.125 --> 23:50.128
Thank you very much.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.130
So happy.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.566
Very comforting.

23:54.567 --> 23:59.905
There is continuity
in this world.

23:59.906 --> 24:07.906
Across town, another
thing entirely.

24:12.652 --> 24:20.652
The younger, wilder
affaire cech ocech

24:25.264 --> 24:33.264
cech ketchup which
means everything is cool.

24:33.706 --> 24:37.543
Are they hipsters or am I just

24:37.544 --> 24:40.178
crazy and thinks anybody
below 30 is a hipster?

24:40.179 --> 24:42.748
I don't know but I admire them.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.850
So how much did it cost
you when you opened?

24:44.851 --> 24:45.718
Not much.

24:45.719 --> 24:49.755
Look at this tiny electric
four burner stove.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.056
At no point in my cooking career

24:51.057 --> 24:52.924
could I have worked with one of

24:52.925 --> 24:53.693
these without murdering everyone

24:53.694 --> 24:55.293
in the vicinity before hanging

24:55.294 --> 24:59.798
myself from the nearest beam.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.800
How long did it take to adapt.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.234
I would say three months.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.036
In the beginning I was lucky I

25:05.037 --> 25:07.138
didn't have a lot of guests.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.608
I was like oh, man.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.810
I was freaking out.

25:11.811 --> 25:13.244
And yet these kids today.

25:13.245 --> 25:14.279
Look at them go.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.915
Serving a wild Liam Bishs and

25:16.916 --> 25:19.084
quite substantial ever changing

25:19.085 --> 25:22.788
menu out of this, this
Suzy home maker oven.

25:22.789 --> 25:27.659
Tonight there's razor clams
and a cream of haddock.

25:27.660 --> 25:30.729
Very cool.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.097
Thank you.

25:31.098 --> 25:34.766
I love clams.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.968
And you'll notice that nobody in

25:36.969 --> 25:41.006
Quebec seems to
skimp on portions.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.509
Head cheese with mustard.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.745
Oh, and truffled sweet breads.

25:46.746 --> 25:53.819
And some goose hearts
for good measure.

25:53.820 --> 25:54.153
Excellent.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.121
Hearts in general.

25:55.122 --> 25:59.157
Also you got your
grilled tomato bread.

25:59.158 --> 26:05.864
That's salt cod for you Anglos.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.767
I'm all swollen up like the tire

26:08.768 --> 26:12.904
dude and ready to burst
on the directional mist.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.642
Hotel/motel time for me.

26:30.489 --> 26:34.660
How Canadian is Quebec?

26:34.661 --> 26:36.828
Are they truly one
entity or two?

26:36.829 --> 26:38.664
This is a question that has been

26:38.665 --> 26:43.835
wrestled with for sometime.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.004
Question Quebec
is certainly part

26:46.005 --> 26:49.875
of Canada but in many ways
another thing entirely.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.744
There is a lot of history
much of it contentious.

26:52.745 --> 26:54.579
Go back far enough, and you get

26:54.580 --> 26:58.750
a clearer picture of why.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.085
The French arrived on the shores

27:00.086 --> 27:04.055
of Quebec city in the early 16th

27:04.056 --> 27:05.523
century and seccumbed to the

27:05.524 --> 27:07.492
military might of Great
Britain in the mid 18th.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.761
Thus began a gradual but steady

27:09.762 --> 27:12.864
persecution of all
things French.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.700
The Quebecwa have struggled

27:14.701 --> 27:16.034
mightily to hang on to their

27:16.035 --> 27:17.502
French heritage and language.

27:17.503 --> 27:19.537
The issue of seceding entirely a

27:19.538 --> 27:25.110
notion that persists to
some extent even today.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.745
Journalist Patrick la gas meets

27:26.746 --> 27:27.946
me for lunch to help me

27:27.947 --> 27:30.081
understand a little bit of what

27:30.082 --> 27:34.052
many Quebecwa feel is at stake.

27:34.053 --> 27:38.356
I was going to talk about the
whole history, identity,

27:38.357 --> 27:39.291
separatist movement but I have

27:39.292 --> 27:45.764
to get right to the
pressing matter of the day.

27:45.765 --> 27:46.132
Pastagate.

27:46.133 --> 27:47.532
What do you want to know?

27:47.533 --> 27:51.803
For those not up on current
Quebec politics, pastagate

27:51.804 --> 27:53.705
refers to an incident where

27:53.706 --> 27:55.306
local authorities notified an

27:55.307 --> 27:57.743
Italian restaurant they were in

27:57.744 --> 27:59.377
violation of French laws because

27:59.378 --> 28:03.749
they used the word pasta
which is Italian.

28:03.750 --> 28:04.450
Okay.

28:04.451 --> 28:05.817
Stop apologizing.

28:05.818 --> 28:06.118
Okay?

28:06.119 --> 28:08.954
Don't get me wrong.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.890
I lean French, hard.

28:11.891 --> 28:16.427
I am enormously sympathetic
to the language laws.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.596
You don't think it
is preposterous?

28:18.597 --> 28:21.967
I do not but here we
have a situation.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.434
It is stupid.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.137
I agree with you completely

28:26.138 --> 28:28.106
that this province 40 years ago

28:28.107 --> 28:30.175
was in some respects
an English city.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.578
We needed to have language
laws for signage and stuff.

28:33.579 --> 28:35.814
Now, signage for instance

28:35.815 --> 28:39.851
must by law be
principally in French.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.787
French first in all things.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.688
But every bureaucracy produces

28:43.689 --> 28:44.790
by products of stupidity.

28:44.791 --> 28:45.591
That was it.

28:45.591 --> 28:46.358
You know what?

28:46.359 --> 28:47.859
It will not stand.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.328
The Anglo Canadian treated

28:50.329 --> 28:52.998
French speaking Quebec law like

28:52.999 --> 28:54.532
second class crap for
much of history.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.533
I get it.

28:55.534 --> 28:56.968
I'd want my own thing and when I

28:56.969 --> 28:58.269
got it I'd want to make sure

28:58.270 --> 29:04.009
there is no back sliding
to the bad old days.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.877
The first sovereign to be

29:05.878 --> 29:08.947
elected in 1976, it didn't
come out of a vacuum.

29:08.948 --> 29:14.352
It came out from a couple
decades of awakening and

29:14.353 --> 29:14.686
struggle.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.321
50 years from now will people

29:16.322 --> 29:18.556
still be speaking predominantly
French in Montreal?

29:18.557 --> 29:19.025
Yes.

29:19.025 --> 29:19.959
No doubt about it.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.560
French first is something
most would agree with.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.963
How far and how vigorously you

29:24.964 --> 29:30.869
want to go with that, well,
do you think there is any

29:30.870 --> 29:35.073
possibility or real majority

29:35.074 --> 29:37.843
plurality who would have voted

29:37.844 --> 29:44.816
in separate nation status?

29:44.817 --> 29:47.986
In English you guys say
timing is everything.

29:47.987 --> 29:51.656
The timing was never
better than in 1991, 1992.

29:51.657 --> 29:52.891
From 1995 this country came

29:52.892 --> 29:54.392
inches from being broken up.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.861
Do you think it will happen

29:55.862 --> 29:57.929
in the history of the world?

29:57.930 --> 29:58.930
I don't know.

29:58.931 --> 29:59.931
But I know one thing.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.900
Anybody who says separatism is

30:01.901 --> 30:03.902
dead in this country and
this province is a fool.

30:03.903 --> 30:07.205
No matter how you feel about

30:07.206 --> 30:08.739
Quebec, either separate from or

30:08.740 --> 30:10.842
as essential part of greater

30:10.843 --> 30:13.344
Canada, any reasonable
person loves this place.

30:13.345 --> 30:17.082
Correct me if I'm wrong.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.350
This is famous for the
sandwich special.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.720
What tradition
does this fall in?

30:22.721 --> 30:23.754
Basically eastern Europe.

30:23.755 --> 30:24.956
It was a survival thing.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.124
It was because they were poor.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.928
And that's what they could make.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.931
Wilensky's an old school

30:32.932 --> 30:35.800
corner institution around since

30:35.801 --> 30:37.468
1932 serving up pressed meat,

30:37.469 --> 30:39.470
bologna, and salami sandwiches

30:39.471 --> 30:40.939
or specials as they call them

30:40.940 --> 30:45.410
with egg Greens and milk shakes.

30:45.411 --> 30:50.081
So the special and an
appropriate beverage.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.416
Very happy.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.718
Here's how it goes.

30:53.719 --> 30:57.088
There are rules.

30:57.089 --> 31:00.058
The special is always
served with mustard.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.659
It is never cut in two.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.261
Don't ask why.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.130
Just because.

31:04.131 --> 31:07.632
That's the way it's
always been done.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.268
A little respect for
tradition, please.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.003
Hum.

31:11.004 --> 31:14.605
I'm happy now.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.407
Some things are beloved
institutions for a reason.

31:16.408 --> 31:20.145
This is delicious.

31:20.146 --> 31:23.549
Thank you.

31:33.159 --> 31:36.761
The tradition of the sugar

31:36.762 --> 31:38.696
shack is as old as maple syrup

31:38.697 --> 31:41.332
here in Quebec where 70% of the

31:41.333 --> 31:44.269
world's supply comes from.

31:44.270 --> 31:48.206
Deeply embedded in the maple
syrup outdoor lumber Jack

31:48.207 --> 31:49.374
lifestyle is the cabin in the

31:49.375 --> 31:53.711
woods where maple sap is
collected and boiled down to

31:53.712 --> 31:54.113
syrup.

31:54.114 --> 31:57.448
Over time, many of these cabins

31:57.449 --> 31:59.017
became informal eating houses,

31:59.018 --> 32:01.386
dining halls for workers and a

32:01.387 --> 32:03.154
few guests where a lucky few

32:03.155 --> 32:04.489
could sit at communal tables and

32:04.490 --> 32:12.363
enjoy the bounty of the trees
and forests around them.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.499
This tradition has been taken to

32:14.500 --> 32:16.734
what is somehow both its logical

32:16.735 --> 32:19.804
conclusion and insane extreme.

32:19.805 --> 32:23.174
Creating his own shack open only

32:23.175 --> 32:25.176
during maple season and serving

32:25.177 --> 32:26.644
food stemming directly from

32:26.645 --> 32:29.714
those humble yet hearty roots.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.050
It makes perfect
sense in one way.

32:32.051 --> 32:35.153
I mean, 130 acres produced about

32:35.154 --> 32:36.754
32,000 gallons of maple sap,

32:36.755 --> 32:38.923
which run through these tubes

32:38.924 --> 32:40.225
here where they're cooked down

32:40.226 --> 32:42.527
to about 800 gallons of syrup,

32:42.528 --> 32:46.031
which is more or less what
they use per season here.

32:46.032 --> 32:50.001
Nothing leaves the property.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.269
And it makes sense while you're

32:51.270 --> 32:53.071
here to raise hogs and cattle on

32:53.072 --> 32:55.240
the property and maybe keep a

32:55.241 --> 32:56.407
cabin or two around for any

32:56.408 --> 33:02.247
friends who get too
loaded to sleep it off.

33:02.248 --> 33:05.216
But this?

33:05.217 --> 33:12.890
This is there really
any reason for this?

33:12.891 --> 33:13.924
What are you doing here?

33:13.925 --> 33:16.894
Why do you have to
make life so hard?

33:16.895 --> 33:18.596
If money were your primary

33:18.597 --> 33:19.964
motivation, this doesn't seem

33:19.965 --> 33:24.135
like the fastest road
to untold wealth.

33:24.136 --> 33:28.906
You know, everybody had a
you can go back three

33:28.907 --> 33:30.475
generations and they
had a sugar shack.

33:30.476 --> 33:33.144
I am very proud of Quebec.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.379
I'm very proud of Canada.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.281
You know?

33:35.282 --> 33:37.282
You celebrate Canadian history.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.950
You celebrate
cannadian traditions.

33:39.951 --> 33:41.219
You celebrate Canadian

33:41.220 --> 33:43.221
ingredients in a way
that no one else has.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.955
Are you some kind of patriot?

33:44.956 --> 33:49.060
Is that what's going on here?

33:49.061 --> 33:50.628
Is it national...
Very much a patriot.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.297
I say it all the time.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.232
This is one of most important

33:54.233 --> 33:57.668
restaurants to me in north
America if not the world.

33:57.669 --> 34:04.442
An art installation if
you actually look at it.

34:04.443 --> 34:11.181
The meal begins with a
power of maple desserts.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.250
Good lord.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.485
Sponge maple toffee, maple

34:14.485 --> 34:17.255
donuts, beaver tails,
maple cotton candy.

34:17.255 --> 34:17.755
But wait.

34:17.757 --> 34:19.324
There's more.

34:19.324 --> 34:22.327
Almond croissant,
whipped biscuits.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.094
Some nugget.

34:23.094 --> 34:23.329
Yeah.

34:23.329 --> 34:24.029
Ah.

34:24.029 --> 34:24.663
There we go.

34:24.664 --> 34:26.331
I think that is a first for me.

34:26.331 --> 34:27.864
I've never seen that done.

34:27.866 --> 34:33.170
Not with a hammer.

34:33.172 --> 34:37.007
Then let the madness begin.

34:37.007 --> 34:38.275
Next, a whole lobe of baked

34:38.277 --> 34:42.179
beans on a pan cake cooked
in duck fat of course.

34:42.181 --> 34:45.216
Cottage cheese and eggs
cooked in maple sirup.

34:45.217 --> 34:45.784
Wow.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.016
That's awesome.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.954
There's a healthy salad.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.489
Sauteed duck hearts, gizzards

34:51.489 --> 34:53.358
and pig's ear topped with a

34:53.359 --> 34:55.560
heaping pile of
fried pork rinds.

34:55.561 --> 34:58.196
Good lord.

34:58.197 --> 35:01.566
Oh, and a calf brain and
maple bacon omlete.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.168
And these.

35:02.169 --> 35:03.301
How this is made?

35:03.302 --> 35:04.069
With love.

35:04.070 --> 35:05.336
With love.

35:05.337 --> 35:09.006
Panko-encrusted duck drum

35:09.007 --> 35:10.708
sticks with shrimp and salmon

35:10.709 --> 35:12.377
moose and maple barbecue sauce.

35:12.378 --> 35:13.644
Good lord.

35:13.645 --> 35:13.845
Wow.

35:13.846 --> 35:18.649
This is a classic dish.

35:18.650 --> 35:23.921
It is a meat pie.

35:23.922 --> 35:29.227
Calf brain, sweet breads,

35:29.228 --> 35:31.262
bacon, and with Martin
that is not sufficient.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.264
Usually there is no
truffle but I just...

35:33.265 --> 35:35.333
Yes, black truffles.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.601
More truffle.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.870
Too much truffle.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.041
My blood is getting thicker
as I look at that.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.676
Now the main course, a home

35:45.677 --> 35:47.111
grown smoked right out front

35:47.112 --> 35:49.347
local ham, with pineapple
and green beans almandine.

35:49.348 --> 35:50.848
And with chicken, but with

35:50.849 --> 35:57.622
Martin, chicken is
never just chicken.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.257
Stuffed with foie
gras and lobster.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.426
We pump lobster bisque
into the chicken.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.127
Good god.

36:03.128 --> 36:11.128
There is a light at the
end of the tunnel.

36:11.903 --> 36:16.241
Oh.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.275
Someone should be singing the

36:17.276 --> 36:20.411
national anthem now,
I mean, really.

36:20.412 --> 36:24.415
In practically prehistoric

36:24.416 --> 36:25.150
old-schooled Canadian classic,

36:25.151 --> 36:26.484
maple syrup is heated, then

36:26.485 --> 36:31.155
poured on snow, making a kind of

36:31.156 --> 36:32.790
Taffy, but the preferred

36:32.791 --> 36:38.829
delivery mechanism does
present some issues.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.097
No, no, no, no, no.

36:40.098 --> 36:40.632
What?

36:40.633 --> 36:42.967
Take a big one, and
you have to suck it.

36:42.968 --> 36:47.438
Don't swallow it, you know?

36:47.439 --> 36:49.940
Look, you have to go like
that, slowly, slowly.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.009
You know?

36:52.010 --> 36:54.945
Just slowly, slowly.

36:54.946 --> 36:57.348
That's how it's good.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.250
That's it.

36:59.251 --> 37:02.086
Can I do that in a manly way?

37:02.087 --> 37:03.688
You just sort of look
away in a distracted way.

37:03.689 --> 37:11.689
I'm not really... the
best way is to look up.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.635
Finally maple meringue cake
and maple ice cream with

37:17.636 --> 37:22.707
chocolate shards.

37:22.708 --> 37:24.442
Any suggestion on
how to attack it.

37:24.443 --> 37:25.510
We did it once.

37:25.511 --> 37:32.483
I went the chef suggests a cone

37:32.484 --> 37:35.720
and the chef suggests
you eat it like that.

37:35.721 --> 37:36.388
There's the thing.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.356
I think there's too much

37:37.357 --> 37:44.495
focusing on the food, wow, these

37:44.496 --> 37:45.530
are very intellectual and wow.

37:45.531 --> 37:46.731
I've done too much of
all those... you know?

37:46.732 --> 37:47.399
I don't want to do that.

37:47.400 --> 37:53.338
I don't want to play
games any more.

37:53.339 --> 37:57.909
Because food is
feces in waiting.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.710
This is CNN.

38:11.189 --> 38:12.423
If there's one thing you
always need on a cold snowy

38:12.424 --> 38:15.326
night, it's yet
another hearty meal.

38:15.327 --> 38:21.165
I meet back up with Dave and the

38:21.166 --> 38:22.867
Liverpool house, sister
restaurant to Joe beef.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.435
I think we always compensate

38:24.436 --> 38:27.572
a little bit with
overabundance of food.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.507
Because of our insecurity of not

38:29.508 --> 38:31.376
being, like, good cooks.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.778
You know what?

38:33.779 --> 38:35.513
It's a combination of low

38:35.514 --> 38:36.947
self-esteem and generosity that

38:36.948 --> 38:39.717
explains the amount
of food, perhaps.

38:39.718 --> 38:45.723
First course... gravlax of char.

38:45.724 --> 38:49.527
Salman gundi.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.396
Beets and eggs.

38:50.397 --> 38:51.397
Look at that.

38:51.398 --> 38:53.130
Unbelievable.

38:53.131 --> 38:57.201
Look at the aspic work.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.504
This is smoked potatoes inside.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.472
Salmon pastrami.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.073
Wait a minute.

39:02.074 --> 39:09.580
This is super classic.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.450
Soft, boiled or poached egg

39:12.451 --> 39:15.620
in clear gelatin broth classly

39:15.621 --> 39:19.056
garnished with white ham,
tarragon leaves and black

39:19.057 --> 39:19.591
truffles.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.392
Oh, my god, I was pretty sure

39:20.392 --> 39:21.159
I would live the rest of my life

39:21.159 --> 39:21.960
without ever seeing this again.

39:21.961 --> 39:24.161
Delicious.

39:24.162 --> 39:27.632
But tonight after a full week of

39:27.633 --> 39:33.604
Franco-Canadian full-on assaults

39:33.605 --> 39:36.941
on our livers and our lights,

39:36.942 --> 39:39.444
Fred and Dave thought it would

39:39.445 --> 39:42.913
be good to take advantage of the

39:42.914 --> 39:45.015
insanely delicious fare by their

39:45.016 --> 39:46.951
brilliant chef Omar,
who's from Pakistan.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.453
Amazing, authentic
Pakistani food.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.822
What do we have here?

39:51.823 --> 39:58.429
Butter chicken crab, tikka,
pomegrana pomegranate.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.697
A little mushrooms.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.833
Rabbit korma.

40:02.834 --> 40:09.139
Fingerlings with a
fenugreek and fennel.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.208
This is donkey hanarri.

40:11.209 --> 40:14.011
Yes, he did say donkey.

40:14.012 --> 40:14.546
The dishes continue.

40:14.546 --> 40:15.313
Pakistani gumbo with okra and

40:15.314 --> 40:18.483
coriander, a says my seed
and green pepper curry.

40:18.484 --> 40:23.320
Hangar steak, scotch egg, and an

40:23.321 --> 40:26.190
authentic goat biryani.

40:26.191 --> 40:26.658
Wow.

40:26.659 --> 40:28.459
Biryani's awesome.

40:28.460 --> 40:28.894
Are you full?

40:28.894 --> 40:29.828
Yeah.

40:29.829 --> 40:31.361
Pretty close.

40:31.362 --> 40:35.032
We did good work here.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.702
In the end, and perhaps as a nod

40:37.703 --> 40:42.206
to the Anglo tradition,
however, there will be stilt.

40:42.207 --> 40:46.677
This is a genius meal.

40:46.678 --> 40:51.482
These princes of gastronomy,

40:51.483 --> 40:53.217
never a suboptimal moment.

40:53.218 --> 40:58.889
Nothing short of
excellent accepted.

40:58.890 --> 40:59.924
Beyond excellent.

40:59.925 --> 41:00.859
Too much excellent?

41:00.859 --> 41:01.226
Yes.

41:01.226 --> 41:01.560
Possibly.

41:01.560 --> 41:01.993
Over the top?

41:01.994 --> 41:03.260
Yeah, definitely.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.062
It all comes around in the end.

41:04.063 --> 41:05.996
The circle of life.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.833
We begin at the beginning, the

41:08.834 --> 41:15.272
heart and soul of every
right-thinking Quebecois,

41:15.273 --> 41:15.674
apparently.

41:15.675 --> 41:18.776
Ice, a stick, and a puck.

41:18.777 --> 41:20.210
Fred and Dave and Martin Picard

41:20.211 --> 41:21.912
are joined by the original god

41:21.913 --> 41:23.848
of Montreal gastronomy, the

41:23.849 --> 41:27.518
great chef Norman la Pris to

41:27.519 --> 41:32.723
watch their beloved Montreal

41:32.724 --> 41:35.560
Canadians lay waste to
the Carolina hurricanes.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.694
All the while eating, of course,

41:36.695 --> 41:39.396
and drinking, as it turns out,

41:39.397 --> 41:44.635
the finest wines
known to humanity.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.871
And here we go.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.775
Oh!
