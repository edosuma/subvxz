WEBVTT

00:03.567 --> 00:06.247
E. R.

00:06.248 --> 00:07.838
Previously on E. R.

00:07.839 --> 00:09.255
I took two Vicodin.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.365
Are you gonna tell Weaver?

00:10.366 --> 00:12.375
- I can't.
- I think you have to.

00:12.376 --> 00:14.327
And I thought we were really hitting it off.

00:14.328 --> 00:17.124
You're straight, and I'm not.

00:17.525 --> 00:19.229
Kynesha, who's this?

00:19.230 --> 00:20.379
This is Tiny.

00:20.414 --> 00:23.635
I hate the thought of her being in my house
alone. Now she's bringing friends over?

00:23.670 --> 00:25.470
I'm sorry. That won't happen again.

00:25.471 --> 00:27.194
Peter, she's manipulating you.

00:27.195 --> 00:31.318
There has never been a more
successful treatment for your tumor.

00:31.319 --> 00:34.151
If you believe that
and mobilize your inner resources...

00:34.286 --> 00:36.121
...you're gonna survive.

00:37.589 --> 00:40.293
E. R. 7x11 "ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS"

00:48.725 --> 00:50.765
Hello?

00:50.936 --> 00:52.478
What?

00:52.896 --> 00:54.972
Who is this?

00:57.526 --> 00:59.768
Okay, tell me what happened.

00:59.945 --> 01:03.314
- Who is it?
- Kynesha, slow down.

01:07.411 --> 01:09.984
Hey, it's me. What's wrong?

01:11.749 --> 01:13.741
Did he put his hands on you?

01:14.627 --> 01:16.121
All right.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.246
Where are you now?

01:19.632 --> 01:21.256
What intersection?

01:21.425 --> 01:26.088
All right. No, just wait there.
I'll pick you up. Yeah, I'll be there.

01:26.973 --> 01:28.218
You're going?

01:28.391 --> 01:31.392
She got into it with somebody
at the halfway house.

01:31.561 --> 01:33.518
She got scared and took off.

01:33.688 --> 01:35.764
Did she report it to the manager?

01:35.940 --> 01:38.478
I don't know.
I guess there's a problem there too.

01:38.652 --> 01:40.229
So where is she?

01:40.403 --> 01:42.111
South Federal.

01:42.322 --> 01:44.398
I thought that wasn't
a safe neighborhood.

01:44.574 --> 01:47.112
That's all she knows, Cleo.

01:47.995 --> 01:50.616
Peter, don't you think that
it's a little strange...

01:50.789 --> 01:54.205
...that she waited until 4:00
in the morning to call us?

01:54.376 --> 01:56.416
Yeah, but what you do you
want me to do?

01:56.587 --> 02:00.086
Leave her out on the street?
It's 10 degrees outside.

02:00.341 --> 02:03.010
You're never going to get rid of her.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.074

02:22.238 --> 02:23.317
Hey.

02:23.489 --> 02:26.277
Mark, go to sleep.

02:26.451 --> 02:28.360
You feeling nauseous?

02:28.536 --> 02:30.161
No.

02:31.289 --> 02:32.618
Have a bad dream?

02:32.958 --> 02:36.872
Please, Mark.
You've got to get your rest.

02:37.045 --> 02:38.872
So do you.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.877
You shouldn't be walking around.
You could fall.

02:43.051 --> 02:45.258
Good thing you're a doctor.

02:49.058 --> 02:51.050
How long you been up?

02:52.728 --> 02:54.804
I never went to sleep, really.

02:55.856 --> 02:58.976
No point worrying about it.
There's nothing you can do.

02:59.819 --> 03:02.061
Gordon didn't say anything else?

03:02.238 --> 03:05.025
Any indication why this meeting
was so urgent?

03:05.491 --> 03:08.741
Just that Patterson's lawyers
called it.

03:10.038 --> 03:13.323
It's probably not bad.
They want to talk.

03:13.708 --> 03:15.582
Yeah, but what about?

03:15.752 --> 03:17.579
You'll know soon enough.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.098
Hurry! Open up! Open up!

03:39.735 --> 03:41.194
- Hurry up!
- Kynesha, what the-?

03:41.362 --> 03:42.939
- Go!
- Hey, hey!

03:43.113 --> 03:45.949
- Open up! Hey, hey, right here.
- Go!

03:48.452 --> 03:50.611
- You owe me, girl!
- Hey man, come on back here.

03:50.788 --> 03:52.579
I'm gonna find you!
I'm gonna find you!

03:52.748 --> 03:57.457
- Kynesha, what the hell was that?
- A bunch of fools used to be my friends.

03:57.628 --> 04:02.789
I told them you were a doctor.
Ain't nothing on this radio?

04:56.147 --> 04:57.310
E. R.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.642
I don't understand.
You don't like the food?

05:01.820 --> 05:03.978
The room-service guy
has seen all my pajamas.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.436
So we'll get up earlier.

05:05.615 --> 05:07.655
Or we could sleep in, at my place.

05:07.826 --> 05:11.076
The paramedics are 10 minutes out
with a possible hip fracture.

05:11.246 --> 05:12.491
- Can you take him?
- Yeah.

05:12.998 --> 05:15.453
Guess you're having breakfast alone.

05:16.418 --> 05:18.375
John, how'd it go last night?

05:18.545 --> 05:19.660
With what?

05:19.838 --> 05:21.332
Weaver. Did you tell her?

05:21.507 --> 05:23.001
Right. I think I'm gonna wait...

05:23.175 --> 05:25.583
- ...until after my midyear evaluation.
- When's that?

05:25.761 --> 05:27.588
Sometime today.

05:27.763 --> 05:29.471
You're procrastinating.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.885
You're nagging.

05:31.058 --> 05:33.845
- I'm being your sponsor.
- It's different than being my mother.

05:34.019 --> 05:35.430
- Don't you think?
- Okay.

05:35.604 --> 05:37.811
Mr. Lambert's in Curtain 3
with a fever...

05:37.982 --> 05:40.271
...Mr. Mohlsick in Exam 1
with frostbite.

05:40.443 --> 05:42.601
Carter, you got evaluation at 11:00.

05:42.779 --> 05:43.977
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't be late.

05:44.155 --> 05:46.313
You want Mrs. Furtado?
She has vaginal bleeding.

05:46.491 --> 05:49.278
She had it last month too.
It's called her period. What else?

05:49.452 --> 05:51.694
Roger Pilarsky's back.
He has abdominal pain.

05:51.871 --> 05:53.947
- Again?
- It's the cold. When it dips below 20...

05:54.124 --> 05:56.116
- I know. Where is he?
- Exam 2.

05:57.210 --> 05:58.835
- Like a "bishop" bishop?
- Yep.

05:59.004 --> 06:01.542
- I think he may have confirmed me.
- Wow.

06:01.715 --> 06:03.838
Started a line.
Gave him four of morphine.

06:04.009 --> 06:06.048
Were you able to get up after your fall?

06:06.219 --> 06:08.296
He tried, but several of us had to help.

06:08.472 --> 06:10.879
- I can speak for myself.
- Peripheral pulses plus two.

06:11.058 --> 06:13.300
- Call him "Your Excellency."
- Bishop is fine.

06:13.477 --> 06:16.513
All right. Let's get him inside
and get him into a gown.

06:17.147 --> 06:20.481
All right. You have a rear window
in stock?

06:20.651 --> 06:23.438
Great. Great. All right, thanks.

06:24.655 --> 06:27.063
That shower felt good.

06:31.495 --> 06:33.784
Don't worry about the window.
I'll pay for it.

06:33.956 --> 06:36.993
- With what?
- I don't know. Something.

06:37.168 --> 06:38.746
You know what, Kynesha?

06:38.920 --> 06:41.162
You need to learn
how to start respecting people.

06:41.756 --> 06:45.172
- I respect you.
- I called the halfway house.

06:45.343 --> 06:47.336
They said you started a fight
and took off.

06:47.512 --> 06:50.347
I hate that place.
The lady that runs it's a bitch.

06:50.515 --> 06:53.089
That's where you live now,
so you better make it work.

06:53.268 --> 06:55.142
Well, I'd rather live with you.

06:55.312 --> 06:58.895
We've been over this.
You can't stay here indefinitely.

06:59.066 --> 07:03.609
I could if you had your own place.
Be a lot easier.

07:03.946 --> 07:07.149
- What do you think you're doing?
- Depends. What you want me to do?

07:07.324 --> 07:08.783
Kynesha, you better-

07:09.034 --> 07:11.323
- Where she at? At work?
- Hey.

07:18.127 --> 07:20.369
It's all good.

07:20.838 --> 07:23.709
I'm too tired now anyway.

07:27.804 --> 07:30.970
Mr. Pilarsky, you haven't stopped
taking your Mellaril, have you?

07:31.140 --> 07:33.382
- No.
- How long's your belly bothered you?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.893
A few days, but it's definitely
gotten worse since I've been here.

07:37.063 --> 07:39.222
He's afebrile. BP's 180/70.

07:39.399 --> 07:42.317
Blood pressure's a little high.
Are you upset, Mr. Pilarsky?

07:42.485 --> 07:44.229
Depressed mostly.

07:44.404 --> 07:47.239
I haven't had intimate contact
in 11 years.

07:47.407 --> 07:51.191
- It takes its toll after a while.
- Why don't we take a look at your belly...

07:51.370 --> 07:53.695
...find out what the problem is.

07:53.872 --> 07:55.912
Oh, for God's sake! Conni?

07:56.083 --> 07:58.241
Mr. Pilarsky, why do you do this
to yourself?

07:58.419 --> 08:00.411
I'm an only child, you know.

08:00.587 --> 08:02.165
- Are those ours?
- Yeah.

08:02.339 --> 08:05.210
Start a line, draw a trauma panel
and set up the SonoSite.

08:05.384 --> 08:06.878
Never did get married.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.844
- You want a Psych consult?
- No.

08:09.013 --> 08:12.263
- Put my career first.
- Let's clear him surgically first.

08:12.850 --> 08:14.475
You want to catch a movie later?

08:21.192 --> 08:24.193
- You didn't get my message, I take it.
- No. Did something change?

08:24.362 --> 08:25.560
The meeting was canceled.

08:25.738 --> 08:28.526
We took a conference call
and agreed on a settlement figure.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.980
That means we accept guilt?

08:30.160 --> 08:35.118
It means the hospital's gonna take it
in the shorts to the tune of $1.5 million.

08:35.874 --> 08:37.498
But our insurance will pay that.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.494
And so will we, with sky-high premiums.

08:39.669 --> 08:40.832
It could've been worse.

08:41.004 --> 08:43.163
We're not getting off cheap.
She didn't pay a dime.

08:43.340 --> 08:47.172
There was a general recall on the
endoscopic curettes that you used.

08:47.344 --> 08:49.551
I didn't have trouble with the curette.

08:49.722 --> 08:51.299
Nonetheless, there was a recall.

08:51.473 --> 08:55.139
We signed a confidentiality agreement
keeping the details of the suit private.

08:55.311 --> 08:56.721
So you can't speak about it.

08:56.896 --> 08:58.888
There was nothing faulty
with the equipment.

08:59.064 --> 09:00.475
Apparently, there was.

09:00.649 --> 09:03.769
And the manufacturer
has deeper pockets.

09:03.945 --> 09:05.355
Well, that's wrong.

09:06.781 --> 09:08.572
Look at it as a gift.

09:09.158 --> 09:12.029
We pay big and you get a ding
at the National Data Bank.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.326
How lucky is that?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.911
Then my parents went through
this whole charismatic phase.

09:19.085 --> 09:21.576
But they're still pretty Catholic.
I mean, you know.

09:21.755 --> 09:24.328
So, what religion do they practice
in your country?

09:24.507 --> 09:27.129
- This is my country, Dave.
- That's not what I meant.

09:27.302 --> 09:29.010
Smooth.

09:30.931 --> 09:32.840
Excuse me. I need-

09:33.016 --> 09:35.768
- Fill out your name and complaint.
- No, I need a laxative.

09:35.936 --> 09:40.397
Amira, why don't you get
an emesis basin for Miss...?

09:40.858 --> 09:43.064
Never mind.

09:44.987 --> 09:47.941
- I'm sorry.
- Why don't you take a seat over here?

09:48.365 --> 09:49.824
- My stomach hurts.
- Thank you.

09:49.992 --> 09:52.993
- I need to go to the bathroom and I can't.
- Tell me your name.

09:53.162 --> 09:54.704
- Anne.
- Anne, I'm Dr. Carter.

09:54.872 --> 09:57.161
Has this ever happened to you before?

09:57.333 --> 09:58.448
It started on the plane.

09:58.626 --> 10:00.453
- From where?
- Texas.

10:00.628 --> 10:03.712
You just flew in?
Did you eat anything unusual?

10:03.881 --> 10:05.791
- Airplane food.
- Well, that could do it.

10:05.967 --> 10:09.253
Let's get you in a room and see
if we can't find out what's going on.

10:09.637 --> 10:14.098
- Oh, my God! It's blood. It's-
- I'm gonna need a little help over here.

10:14.643 --> 10:16.801
Did you land on your side
or on your back?

10:16.978 --> 10:20.394
On my keister.
Several small children found it amusing.

10:20.565 --> 10:22.807
We were quite worried.

10:22.984 --> 10:24.527
Any tenderness here?

10:25.195 --> 10:27.235
Not so much.

10:27.406 --> 10:31.534
Joe, you're making me nervous.
Go get yourself a cup of coffee.

10:32.286 --> 10:33.946
Please.

10:35.664 --> 10:38.749
Last thing I need is an entourage.

10:40.169 --> 10:42.494
Any physical conditions
I should know about?

10:42.671 --> 10:45.626
Osteoarthritis. Runs in the family.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.792
Are you currently on any medications?

10:47.969 --> 10:52.547
Tylenol. And the occasional glass
of wine.

10:53.683 --> 10:56.637
Where are you from?
You have an accent.

10:57.228 --> 10:59.351
Croatia.

11:01.357 --> 11:04.524
- Any numbness in this area?
- No.

11:05.445 --> 11:09.657
Do you have a primary care doctor
I should notify?

11:09.824 --> 11:12.197
He's playing golf in Arizona.

11:12.369 --> 11:17.114
Okay. Someone will take you to X-ray.

11:17.291 --> 11:21.419
- Would you like anything for pain?
- I have a high threshold.

11:24.882 --> 11:27.587
Croatia is a very Catholic country.

11:29.011 --> 11:30.386
Yes.

11:31.138 --> 11:33.890
- Are you Catholic?
- No.

11:40.565 --> 11:42.723
That's it?
That's all you're going to tell me?

11:42.900 --> 11:45.735
She got into a fight
and took off to hang out with friends.

11:45.903 --> 11:47.563
So this whole "I was attacked"...

11:47.739 --> 11:50.609
- ... was blown out of proportion.
- A little.

11:50.783 --> 11:52.906
Did you take her back
to the halfway house?

11:53.077 --> 11:54.109
Not yet.

11:54.746 --> 11:58.079
- Then where did you take her?
- Well, she needed to take a shower.

12:00.543 --> 12:01.575
It's just for the day.

12:01.753 --> 12:03.829
You said that
when she stayed three weeks.

12:04.005 --> 12:05.665
I'll handle it.

12:10.220 --> 12:13.138
Small Mallory-Weiss tear.

12:13.307 --> 12:16.473
- No active bleeding, though.
- Temperature's higher, 102.

12:17.394 --> 12:20.312
Wait. Foreign body obstructing
the gastric outlet.

12:20.481 --> 12:23.019
- Good call on the ultrasound.
- Okay. Grasper.

12:25.027 --> 12:28.230
Reminds me of one of those big
claw things they have at the arcade.

12:28.406 --> 12:29.983
What do you call them?

12:30.157 --> 12:32.280
Big claw things.

12:35.997 --> 12:38.203
What the heck is that?

12:38.374 --> 12:42.917
Got it. Okay, slowly extracting.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.549
BP's rising. 160/100.

12:46.716 --> 12:48.376
Up.

12:48.843 --> 12:51.002
Up.

12:52.097 --> 12:53.888
And out.

12:54.057 --> 12:57.177
Pulse is 140. BP's high, 240/100.

12:57.686 --> 12:58.884
Is that a condom?

12:59.604 --> 13:02.808
Probably cocaine. Must have leaked.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.818
I need phentolamine and esmolol drips.
50 grams of charcoal...

13:05.986 --> 13:09.320
...and four of Ativan
in case she seizes.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.031
She's a drug mule.

13:13.469 --> 13:16.987
I just heard that Roger Pilarsky
was treated for a self-inflicted injury.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.284
Yeah, with a pair
of our suture scissors no less.

13:20.459 --> 13:22.333
- You sent him home?
- It was superficial.

13:22.503 --> 13:24.128
Didn't breach the peritoneum.

13:24.297 --> 13:26.170
There should have been
a Psych consult.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.582
He's a frequent flier.
A new injury every week.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.503
Could be an accelerating pattern.

13:30.678 --> 13:32.671
He's never had
a serious suicide attempt.

13:32.847 --> 13:36.097
Your department's refused to admit him
on three separate occasions.

13:36.267 --> 13:38.723
He tried to harm himself.
We're supposed to be called.

13:38.895 --> 13:41.267
All he wanted was food and company.

13:42.148 --> 13:43.477
Frankly, I thought you'd be grateful that-

13:43.650 --> 13:45.393
Kerry, I-

13:45.469 --> 13:50.695
I think we should not let what happened
between us interfere with patient care.

13:51.033 --> 13:53.903
- What?
- We're both professionals.

13:54.077 --> 13:56.699
Excuse me. I did what I thought
was medically appropriate.

13:56.872 --> 13:59.707
It had nothing to do with the fact
you've been avoiding me?

13:59.875 --> 14:02.793
It doesn't, and I haven't.

14:02.962 --> 14:06.212
But if you'd like me to call you
every time someone disturbed...

14:06.382 --> 14:08.421
...comes into the ER, you've got it.

14:09.135 --> 14:11.376
Thank you.

14:18.561 --> 14:21.764
Where did you really fly in from?
South America?

14:21.939 --> 14:23.731
Belize.

14:24.567 --> 14:28.647
Well, you're lucky you didn't pop
at 35,000 feet.

14:28.822 --> 14:29.853
You might've died.

14:30.198 --> 14:32.238
Maybe that would have been better.

14:34.577 --> 14:37.532
You mind telling me
how you got into all this?

14:38.748 --> 14:41.121
I was robbed.

14:41.376 --> 14:43.203
They took everything:

14:43.378 --> 14:46.878
My money. My passport. My clothes.

14:47.049 --> 14:49.374
Even my shoes.

14:49.551 --> 14:52.718
So you decided
to smuggle drugs to get back.

14:53.472 --> 14:57.090
I met this man.
He was very nice to me.

14:57.810 --> 14:58.925
He said he would help.

14:59.103 --> 15:04.346
All I had to do was stop
here in the United States for him.

15:07.403 --> 15:09.609
But you knew what he
was asking you to do.

15:10.198 --> 15:13.282
I just wanted to go home.

15:13.451 --> 15:17.401
That's all.
I wanted to go home.

15:22.127 --> 15:25.709
That whole celibacy thing was always
the sticking point for me, though.

15:25.880 --> 15:30.258
- Yeah, me too. But I got over it.
- Yeah, well...

15:30.427 --> 15:34.721
Dr. Kovac, did you know
that St. Peter was married?

15:35.932 --> 15:37.641
Anyway, I should get going.

15:37.809 --> 15:41.143
- Nice talking to you, Bishop Stewart.
- Same here.

15:43.899 --> 15:47.897
You have a lot of degenerative changes,
but no fracture.

15:48.070 --> 15:51.154
There will be bruising, but the worst
should be over in a few days.

15:51.323 --> 15:54.111
- Yeah, I know the drill.
- You fall a lot?

15:54.744 --> 15:57.828
Damned arthritis makes me wobbly,
especially when it's cold.

15:57.997 --> 15:59.277
Ever use a walker?

15:59.457 --> 16:01.496
That would cramp my style,
don't you think?

16:01.667 --> 16:03.993
Might save your hips.

16:04.420 --> 16:09.711
Last time I had a flareup, my doctor put
me on this IV, gave me some...

16:09.884 --> 16:11.343
...some kind of steroid.

16:11.511 --> 16:14.002
- Solu-Medrol?
- That's it.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.260
The stuff worked wonders.

16:15.515 --> 16:17.674
You realize it's a temporary fix.

16:17.976 --> 16:21.475
I'll take whatever I can get.
Just so it gets me through the hard bits.

16:21.646 --> 16:26.059
Okay. I'll give you the Solu-Medrol
if you promise to use a walker.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.320
- What? Are we negotiating?
- Not really.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.733
Do you want the steroids?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.520
I'll use a cane.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.949
Yosh? 125 milligrams
of Solu-Medrol for the bishop...

16:38.122 --> 16:40.992
...and order a cane
from Central Supply.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.791
You got it.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.538
What was your confirmation name?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.080
Mihael.

16:49.759 --> 16:54.006
After the patron saint of the sick.
How appropriate.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.225
"He has questioned...

16:58.393 --> 17:01.180
the decision-making of senior physicians
in critical-care settings."

17:01.354 --> 17:03.512
I have a detailed list
if you're interested.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.564
Probably not.

17:05.733 --> 17:09.316
Interpersonal skills, how you deal
with patients and staff, all excellent.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.895
In fact, it's hard to find fault
with your work.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.271
Really?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.867
You've made a remarkable comeback
from a serious addiction.

17:18.372 --> 17:21.871
And I think I speak for everyone
when I say that we're proud of you.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.792
Thank you.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.084
Good. We're pretty
jammed up out there...

17:26.255 --> 17:30.253
...so unless there's anything you want to
talk about, sign the bottom of the form.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.087
Is there something you want
to talk about?

17:35.473 --> 17:39.387
Sorry. Multi-victim trauma.
We're gonna need everybody.

17:40.353 --> 17:42.013
Let's go.

17:43.231 --> 17:45.722
Seven-year-old hit in the crosswalk
by a pickup doing 30.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.976
Complains of chest pain
and shortness of breath.

17:48.152 --> 17:51.486
- Tachy at 120. BP 90/60.
- Hi, honey. Can you tell me your name?

17:51.656 --> 17:55.107
- Amy. Where's my mom?
- Next ambulance.

17:55.285 --> 17:57.277
- Take a breath, Amy.
- Does your tummy hurt?

17:57.454 --> 17:59.612
No. Is my dad okay?

17:59.789 --> 18:03.621
We'll find out when we finish with you.
We need a chest tube on the left.

18:03.793 --> 18:06.629
Julie Hembree, 32 years old.
Chest and abdominal pain.

18:06.797 --> 18:09.798
- I thought there were three.
- Father was DOA at the scene.

18:09.967 --> 18:12.292
Systolic of 80 in the field.
Now up to 100.

18:12.469 --> 18:14.960
Where's Amy?
Where's my husband?

18:15.139 --> 18:16.847
It might be a rib fracture.

18:17.141 --> 18:20.142
Okay, she needs an ultrasound.
Let's get Surgery down here.

18:21.186 --> 18:23.856
Mandy, can you push the
cholecystectomy to next week?

18:24.023 --> 18:25.185
- Sure.
- These are lovely.

18:25.357 --> 18:27.849
Glad you think so.
They're for you.

18:30.279 --> 18:33.814
- From Dr. Greene?
- Yes.

18:33.991 --> 18:36.696
O.R. Hold on.

18:36.869 --> 18:38.945
Dr. Corday, they need you downstairs.

18:39.122 --> 18:40.153
I'm on my way.

18:40.415 --> 18:43.831
- Should I put these in your office?
- Please.

18:48.590 --> 18:50.582
Mr. Patterson,
what are you doing here?

18:50.759 --> 18:52.751
I came to see you.

18:52.928 --> 18:55.169
I've been called
to the Emergency department.

18:55.347 --> 18:56.627
I'll ride down with you.

18:57.307 --> 18:58.849
Okay.

19:04.690 --> 19:08.023
Please allow me to say that I feel
terrible about what's happened.

19:09.611 --> 19:13.396
Which part? Me being crippled
or you getting sued for malpractice?

19:14.199 --> 19:16.869
My concern was for your situation,
not mine.

19:17.036 --> 19:19.871
Yeah. Doesn't really compare, does it?

19:22.583 --> 19:26.201
Strange how it all comes down
to faulty equipment.

19:27.588 --> 19:30.755
My lawyer tells me
I can't really blame you.

19:32.635 --> 19:34.711
But I can't quite forgive you either.

19:37.223 --> 19:40.557
Imagine I'll always remember
your face.

19:40.727 --> 19:43.763
- I wonder whether you'll remember mine.
- Start in Trauma 1!

19:44.272 --> 19:45.731
Weaver needs that in 2.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.186
They'll need you right away.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.436
- I'm really sorry.
- Go, go.

19:51.029 --> 19:52.737
I'm so sorry.

19:54.741 --> 19:57.529
- What is it, Conni?
- Auto versus peds. Mother and daughter.

19:57.703 --> 19:59.861
- Any critical?
- The kid in Trauma 1 looks bad.

20:00.038 --> 20:01.237
- Where's Benton?
- I don't know.

20:01.415 --> 20:03.906
- What is it?
- Blunt chest, hemopneumo on the left.

20:04.084 --> 20:06.326
- Did you scan the belly?
- It seemed pretty benign.

20:06.503 --> 20:08.496
- Where's ultrasound?
- Next door.

20:08.672 --> 20:10.998
- Why don't you examine her first?
- Where's my mom?

20:11.175 --> 20:13.631
We'll take this collar off.
You'll feel better.

20:13.803 --> 20:16.590
- Okay. One percent with epi.
- Sats are down to 82.

20:16.764 --> 20:18.638
Put her up to 15 liters.

20:19.267 --> 20:21.936
Ten blade. How's the abdomen?

20:22.103 --> 20:24.938
Non-tender. I can't clear her
until we have an imaging study.

20:25.106 --> 20:26.481
That hurts!

20:26.858 --> 20:28.601
- Amy, it's okay.
- You want to intubate?

20:28.985 --> 20:31.903
- Let's wait for the chest tube.
- Green zone on the Broselow.

20:32.072 --> 20:33.352
Give me a curved Kelly.

20:33.531 --> 20:36.153
- I want my mom!
- Slow breaths, Amy.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.906
Slow, deep breaths.

20:42.624 --> 20:45.115
Pressure's down to 60.
She's bleeding out.

20:45.294 --> 20:47.785
Okay. Hang two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser.

20:47.963 --> 20:50.335
We need to intubate.
Let's pre-medicate with atropine.

20:50.507 --> 20:52.547
Dr. Corday, Dr. Weaver
needs you right now.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.627
Let's keep up with the blood loss.

20:54.928 --> 20:55.960
You need me?

20:56.180 --> 20:59.631
Rebound and guarding in the right
quadrant. Looks like a surgical belly.

20:59.808 --> 21:04.305
- Please, how is she? My daughter.
- There's some bleeding in the chest.

21:04.605 --> 21:06.313
What does that mean?
Is she okay?

21:07.024 --> 21:09.646
She's stable for right now,
but it is serious.

21:09.819 --> 21:12.773
And what about my husband?
Is he here too?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.365
Oh, God. No.

21:19.537 --> 21:21.945
Hey, we don't know
anything for sure yet.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.289
We've got a liver laceration.

21:24.459 --> 21:26.665
You have some internal bleeding
from the injury.

21:26.836 --> 21:30.040
We need to get you up to the O.R. now
so we can stop the bleeding.

21:30.465 --> 21:31.710
Type-specific's up.

21:31.883 --> 21:34.553
Squeeze in two units.
Tell the O.R. we're on our way.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.214
Get her upstairs. Let's go.

21:39.182 --> 21:40.297
Over a liter out on the left.

21:40.475 --> 21:42.848
- Get two more units of blood.
- Push the etomidate.

21:43.020 --> 21:46.187
- We need to tube her.
- No, wait. Just bag her.

21:47.608 --> 21:50.858
- Bring your patient in here.
- I'm red-lining her to the O.R.

21:51.195 --> 21:53.567
We're not maintaining pressure.
What are you doing?

21:53.739 --> 21:56.361
- Her daughter should see her first.
- I want to see her.

21:56.534 --> 21:59.654
- She has a critical liver laceration.
- How much blood do you have?

21:59.829 --> 22:01.738
- Four units.
- You'll be just fine.

22:01.914 --> 22:04.488
Listen. Her systolic's down to 80.

22:04.667 --> 22:08.451
- Get two pressure bags for the blood.
- Push the etomidate, then the sux.

22:08.630 --> 22:11.880
Amy, it's Mommy.

22:12.801 --> 22:14.627
You're gonna be all right.

22:15.595 --> 22:20.886
They're gonna take me to surgery now.
But I'll see you real soon, okay?

22:21.893 --> 22:23.886
She's out. Five-and-a-half tube.

22:24.062 --> 22:26.849
- Amy?
- That's it. We're going. Now!

22:27.733 --> 22:31.980
Cricoid pressure right there.
I'm in. Bag her.

22:32.154 --> 22:35.155
Okay, call X-ray for a portable chest.

22:35.908 --> 22:37.900
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

22:38.077 --> 22:40.568
- Pulse ox is up to 92.
- Set up a vent.

22:40.746 --> 22:42.952
FiO2, 100 percent. Rate of 20.

22:43.290 --> 22:45.579
Damn it! Lost her pulse!
Starting compressions.

22:45.751 --> 22:47.080
Charge the paddles to 100.

22:47.253 --> 22:50.503
And get another 8 units from
the blood bank. Keep pouring it in.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.871
Charged and ready.

22:52.550 --> 22:53.581
Clear.

22:56.262 --> 22:57.293
This the ex-lap?

22:57.472 --> 22:59.595
Yes. Still a little shocky after five liters.

22:59.766 --> 23:01.426
- Did you give FFP?
- Not yet.

23:01.601 --> 23:04.970
- What are you waiting for?
- We were rather busy.

23:05.146 --> 23:07.139
Will you be doing
an atrial-caval shunt?

23:07.315 --> 23:08.857
I won't know until I open her up.

23:09.025 --> 23:11.184
It would help if I knew
what you were planning.

23:11.361 --> 23:14.647
Yes. Well, when I decide I'll tell you.

23:18.910 --> 23:21.828
I think Anspaugh's in the lounge.
Can you ask him to assist?

23:21.997 --> 23:24.749
He's ready to go on a fem-pop in 4.

23:24.958 --> 23:26.287
Any other Attendings around?

23:26.460 --> 23:29.295
They're all scrubbed in.
It's just you on this one.

23:30.506 --> 23:32.961
- Give another epi.
- Sats are down to 70.

23:33.133 --> 23:36.218
- Two more liters out of the chest.
- Autotransfuse. Hang two more.

23:36.387 --> 23:39.257
- She's losing it too fast.
- Hold the compressions.

23:39.432 --> 23:40.677
P.E.A. rate of 49.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.637
Set me up for pericardiocentesis.
Take over here.

23:43.811 --> 23:44.974
Think she's in tamponade?

23:45.229 --> 23:47.471
It's our last chance for treating P.E.A.

23:47.648 --> 23:48.763
Give me the alligator clip.

23:48.941 --> 23:51.397
- Hook it up to the V-1 lead.
- JVD's four centimeters.

23:51.569 --> 23:53.811
- She's still hypovolemic.
- Bradying down to 40.

23:54.113 --> 23:55.940
Watch for any injury current.

23:56.115 --> 23:57.147
There. Back off.

23:58.868 --> 24:03.993
- Anything in the pericardium?
- Nothing. Resume compressions.

24:11.757 --> 24:13.215
What's this?

24:13.383 --> 24:15.709
- I called for a consult.
- I'm admitting her.

24:16.345 --> 24:18.836
- Why?
- Danger to self.

24:19.098 --> 24:21.671
Does the pound of cocaine
she swallowed figure into this?

24:21.850 --> 24:22.882
It wasn't a pound.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.812
We're not obligated to report
drug use to the authorities.

24:25.980 --> 24:29.515
But I'd imagine in the case of
drug smuggling we'd make an exception.

24:29.692 --> 24:33.143
She's not a dealer. She's a kid. She
made a mistake and almost got killed.

24:33.321 --> 24:34.898
Maybe, but she's not suicidal.

24:35.072 --> 24:36.816
What's your problem, Kerry?

24:38.242 --> 24:40.365
- What?
- She's 18 years old.

24:42.455 --> 24:43.997
Could you excuse us, Dr. Carter?

24:44.207 --> 24:47.706
Her going to prison isn't going
to benefit anybody.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.206
Excuse us.

24:54.384 --> 25:00.054
Don't you ever talk to me like that
in front of a resident again.

25:00.223 --> 25:03.758
I wouldn't have to if you didn't insist
on interfering with my admission.

25:03.977 --> 25:06.053
- She's an ER case.
- Which I was called into.

25:06.230 --> 25:07.854
I'm admitting her.

25:15.906 --> 25:17.650
Agonal rhythm, rate of 29.

25:17.825 --> 25:19.734
Has she had two doses of atropine?

25:19.910 --> 25:21.453
Fifteen minutes ago.

25:21.620 --> 25:26.081
- What about thoracotomy?
- No. She had a fatal injury.

25:26.626 --> 25:29.580
Probably tore her aorta. That's it.

25:30.588 --> 25:32.497
Asystole.

25:33.925 --> 25:34.956
Call it.

25:35.510 --> 25:38.427
Time of death 1:47 p. m.

25:39.347 --> 25:42.882
Paramedics just brought in another
trauma. We need a doctor in here.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.301
I've got it.

25:47.772 --> 25:52.185
Let me out of here! I gotta go!

25:52.360 --> 25:54.768
Let me out!

25:55.781 --> 25:57.820
Kevin Poole, 42, very drunk.

25:58.033 --> 26:00.441
Under police pursuit
until he hit a concrete column.

26:00.619 --> 26:03.905
Needed the Jaws of Life to get him.
Vitals are stable, but he's a pain.

26:04.081 --> 26:05.990
Settle down.

26:06.166 --> 26:09.286
I'm Dr. Kovac.
I'm going to examine your injuries.

26:09.461 --> 26:11.454
- I need you to stay calm.
- What injuries?

26:11.630 --> 26:13.789
- Lovely.
- Why were the police chasing him?

26:13.966 --> 26:17.466
Hit-and-run. Took out a family at
a crosswalk. They come here or Mercy?

26:17.637 --> 26:20.970
- Here.
- I gotta- I gotta go.

26:21.390 --> 26:23.846
I gotta find my wallet.

26:24.811 --> 26:26.471
I'm gonna put a tube in your nose.

26:26.646 --> 26:29.849
- Want me to numb him up first?
- No. Just hold his head still.

26:38.825 --> 26:39.988
Swallow, sir.

26:40.994 --> 26:42.654
I can spray the back of his throat.

26:42.829 --> 26:44.158
Just keep swallowing.

27:01.390 --> 27:02.421
Hey.

27:03.142 --> 27:04.885
This is good.

27:05.311 --> 27:07.268
What's wrong? You ain't hungry?

27:08.189 --> 27:09.220
Hi, Kynesha.

27:12.193 --> 27:14.565
- Who is she?
- This is Adele Neuman.

27:14.904 --> 27:16.529
She's a social worker.

27:16.698 --> 27:17.943
Nice meeting you.

27:18.908 --> 27:21.482
I thought you called me here
so I could be with you.

27:21.995 --> 27:24.616
I'm trying to find you
a permanent place to live.

27:26.916 --> 27:31.080
I have a husband and wife in Riverside
who are both African-American.

27:31.254 --> 27:33.792
And they have two other
foster children your age.

27:35.133 --> 27:36.925
I thought you said
you cared about me.

27:37.969 --> 27:40.887
I said I care about
what happens to you.

27:41.390 --> 27:42.552
Yeah, right.

27:42.724 --> 27:46.058
You only doing all this because of Jesse.
You think I don't know that?

27:46.228 --> 27:47.259
That's not true.

27:47.563 --> 27:50.315
- I know that bitch Cleo don't like me.
- Kynesha.

27:50.482 --> 27:52.356
I knew that all along.

27:52.526 --> 27:55.064
You are underage without a way
to provide for yourself.

27:55.237 --> 27:58.108
Now, it's either foster care
or becoming a ward of the state.

27:58.282 --> 27:59.527
Which would you prefer?

28:04.831 --> 28:08.828
Fine. You don't want me. I'm gone.

28:09.043 --> 28:10.324
Kynesha. Kynesha!

28:10.503 --> 28:12.163
Just let me take it from here.

28:17.302 --> 28:20.587
She's got a stage-three stellate fracture
into the deep parenchyma.

28:20.764 --> 28:22.840
- More suction, Shirley.
- Canister's full.

28:23.016 --> 28:24.925
Well, change it.

28:26.353 --> 28:28.345
She's oozing all over the place.

28:28.522 --> 28:30.810
- How about platelets?
- Already gave them.

28:30.983 --> 28:32.856
You need to correct her coagulopathy.

28:33.026 --> 28:35.696
ET and bleeding time are normal.

28:35.946 --> 28:37.689
It's your problem, not mine.

28:39.158 --> 28:40.700
All right. Right.

28:41.170 --> 28:45.062
I'm gonna try and pack the liver
and get out.

28:45.539 --> 28:48.576
Okay, gel foam, Penrose.

28:48.959 --> 28:53.004
- Come on!
- BP's dropping. 90/60.

28:53.172 --> 28:57.585
- You have to control the bleeding.
- The injury's too extensive.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.168
Maybe I can get caval control.

29:02.473 --> 29:04.098
Bovie, pickups.

29:04.267 --> 29:07.054
I can't maintain her vitals
unless you get hemostasis.

29:07.228 --> 29:09.517
- I know that!
- She's lost another liter.

29:09.689 --> 29:11.267
Two more going up on the infuser.

29:11.441 --> 29:14.228
- Call. Call for six more.
- BP's still dropping.

29:14.402 --> 29:15.897
Heart rate up to 120.

29:16.071 --> 29:19.570
There's too much blood in the field.
I can't isolate the vena cava.

29:20.367 --> 29:21.945
She's bleeding out.

29:22.411 --> 29:23.442
Get Romano.

29:23.620 --> 29:24.735
I don't know if he's available.

29:24.913 --> 29:27.535
I said, get Romano. Benton! Somebody!

29:28.125 --> 29:29.370
Come on, more laps!

29:30.085 --> 29:31.117
How's he doing?

29:31.295 --> 29:34.082
Blood alcohol level is 0.35,
but he's stable.

29:34.256 --> 29:36.961
You're under arrest for vehicular
manslaughter, Mr. Poole.

29:37.134 --> 29:40.918
- What?
- Your Morrison's Pouch is dry.

29:41.097 --> 29:43.469
- Liver intact.
- Three DUIs, revoked license...

29:43.724 --> 29:47.425
- ...the idiot still gets behind the wheel.
- Let me out of here, damn it!

29:47.603 --> 29:49.014
Sir, you have to hold still.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.600
His spleen looks good.

29:51.315 --> 29:52.596
She said stop.

29:52.775 --> 29:54.104
All right, what do we got?

29:54.277 --> 29:56.104
MVA with a lot of ETOH.

29:56.279 --> 29:58.948
- No free fluid?
- Crit is 42.

29:59.115 --> 30:01.441
Excellent. Sir, does it hurt here?

30:01.785 --> 30:02.983
Who the hell are you?

30:03.161 --> 30:04.952
Okay. How about here? All right.

30:05.121 --> 30:09.665
Some periumbilical tenderness.
Okay, let's call Radiology, order a CT.

30:10.210 --> 30:11.490
Do you think it's necessary?

30:11.670 --> 30:14.339
It's hard to assess them
when they're drunk like this.

30:14.506 --> 30:15.621
I like to be sure.

30:19.970 --> 30:21.512
Hey, it's Abby in the ER.

30:21.680 --> 30:24.254
Yeah, I can hold.
How'd it go?

30:24.433 --> 30:26.924
The evaluation? It went very well.

30:27.228 --> 30:29.351
- And?
- What?

30:30.815 --> 30:32.523
- Forget it.
- I didn't get a chance.

30:32.692 --> 30:34.815
- You interrupted with the trauma.
- Forget it.

30:38.573 --> 30:40.150
- Yeah, hello.
- What's going on?

30:40.324 --> 30:42.151
Sorry. Can you hold on?
With what?

30:42.326 --> 30:45.078
- With you and Carter.
- Nothing.

30:45.246 --> 30:47.654
- It seemed like you were fighting.
- We were.

30:49.042 --> 30:51.663
I'd tell you, but it's a privacy thing.
His, not mine.

30:54.965 --> 30:59.128
Hi. Yeah, Benton's on his way up
with a blunt abdominal trauma.

31:00.011 --> 31:01.043
Better be good.

31:01.221 --> 31:03.344
Liver fracture
with uncontrolled hemorrhage.

31:03.515 --> 31:06.551
You called me out of a lunch
because you can't tie off a liver?

31:06.810 --> 31:09.348
BP's 80/40, pulse rate 120.

31:09.521 --> 31:12.226
- Ten units already in.
- Set up the argon beam.

31:12.399 --> 31:15.982
- I tried to get caval control, but I-
- You try the Pringle maneuver?

31:16.987 --> 31:19.692
You learned it in grade school,
Dr. Corday.

31:20.783 --> 31:24.484
Ligate with 4.0 chromic while
I occlude the hepatic artery. Get out.

31:24.662 --> 31:27.034
- Argon's ready.
- All right.

31:27.206 --> 31:29.876
I'll coagulate the parenchymal surface.
Tie off the vessels.

31:30.459 --> 31:31.622
- Robert-
- Not now.

31:31.794 --> 31:33.870
- Get to work.
- You need another assistant.

31:34.047 --> 31:38.044
- Make yourself useful and sew.
- Robert, I'm sorry. I can't stay.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.840
- I'll send in a resident.
- Where are you going?

31:41.012 --> 31:45.923
- I'm sorry.
- Get your ass over here now! Damn it!

31:48.562 --> 31:49.842
Mark?

31:50.021 --> 31:51.136
Hey, Luka.

31:51.314 --> 31:54.268
- Need some help?
- No, no, no. I'm fine. Thank you.

31:54.443 --> 31:56.566
So, what are you doing here?

31:56.737 --> 32:00.070
Radiation therapy.
Every day for six weeks.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.320
Elizabeth's giving me a ride back,
but she's stuck in surgery.

32:05.245 --> 32:07.997
- Doctor Chen still out on leave?
- Yeah. Yeah.

32:08.165 --> 32:11.368
- You coming back to work soon?
- Next week, I hope.

32:11.877 --> 32:13.122
Fast recovery, huh?

32:13.295 --> 32:14.706
Yeah. Speed of light.

32:16.549 --> 32:18.874
I heard you were doing
immune therapy.

32:19.635 --> 32:22.423
As soon as the tumor vaccine's ready.

32:24.223 --> 32:26.097
So everything okay around here?

32:26.601 --> 32:29.056
Okay as ever. Don't worry.

32:30.730 --> 32:34.265
I don't. Honest.
Life's too short, you know?

32:35.068 --> 32:36.692
I know.

32:38.613 --> 32:40.820
So how are you, Luka?

32:42.158 --> 32:43.736
The same.

32:47.122 --> 32:50.076
- Good to see you.
- You too.

32:57.966 --> 32:59.247
- Where is he?
- Who?

32:59.426 --> 33:01.585
- The bishop.
- I think he went to Trauma 1.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.799
- What for?
- To give someone their last rites.

33:07.309 --> 33:09.183
- Are you sorry for your sins?
- What happened?

33:09.353 --> 33:11.642
- He crashed during CT.
- Yes.

33:11.814 --> 33:16.192
May our Lord Jesus Christ grant you
absolution, and by his authority...

33:16.360 --> 33:18.483
- I can't hear!
- May our Lord Jesus Christ...

33:18.655 --> 33:20.113
Cross match another six.

33:20.281 --> 33:22.607
- Pressure is 60.
- I absolve you of all your sins.

33:22.784 --> 33:24.823
- Put him in Trendelenburg.
- He needs a central line.

33:24.994 --> 33:28.529
- Let's get an eight French trauma kit.
- Okay, prep for a subclavian.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.331
Sats down to 75.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.501
He's not moving any air.
Bag him. I'll intubate.

33:34.171 --> 33:36.163
You should leave.

33:40.636 --> 33:41.916
Oh, God...

33:42.095 --> 33:44.337
Okay, one of Pavulon, 100 of sux.

33:44.515 --> 33:47.350
I need a sterile drape in here, people.
Come on, let's move.

33:58.654 --> 34:00.279
- Are you taking off?
- Yeah.

34:00.448 --> 34:03.484
I know a guy playing in a blues club
later, if you're interested.

34:03.659 --> 34:07.527
- No, I think I'm just gonna go home.
- Maybe tomorrow. He'll be here all week.

34:07.705 --> 34:09.199
Hey.

34:10.625 --> 34:13.246
I need to talk to you
about this Weaver thing.

34:14.963 --> 34:16.790
Look, nothing happened.
I threw them up.

34:17.215 --> 34:19.884
I know I'm fine. You know I'm fine.
Weaver thinks I'm fine.

34:20.051 --> 34:22.043
So why give her any reason not to?

34:22.219 --> 34:23.465
I don't know.

34:24.556 --> 34:26.880
Maybe you can take
that up with your next sponsor.

34:27.058 --> 34:28.469
What?

34:28.643 --> 34:31.099
I don't want to be
your sponsor anymore.

34:32.063 --> 34:34.899
- Where's that coming from?
- I care about you.

34:35.067 --> 34:38.650
And I care about your recovery, but I
can't keep saying the same things.

34:38.821 --> 34:41.275
Because it's hard enough for me
to do it for myself.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.322
- You serious?
- Yeah.

34:44.784 --> 34:47.407
- Fine. I'll get another sponsor.
- Okay.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.291
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:56.505 --> 34:58.249
Dr. Finch, you lose your compass?

34:58.424 --> 35:01.129
- I'm here to see Julie Hembree.
- One lucky lady.

35:01.302 --> 35:04.505
A Pringle maneuver courtesy
of yours truly kept her from bleeding out.

35:04.681 --> 35:06.258
I thought Corday did the surgery.

35:07.392 --> 35:11.603
Long story. I'll tell you
over cocoa sometime. She's all yours.

35:17.277 --> 35:18.688
Mrs. Hembree?

35:18.862 --> 35:20.938
You were one of the doctors
for my daughter?

35:21.865 --> 35:23.443
Yes.

35:24.409 --> 35:25.441
Is she all right?

35:27.287 --> 35:30.039
Amy was hit in the chest
at a very high speed.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.161
I know. I was there.

35:34.503 --> 35:36.959
She needed help breathing,
so we intubated.

35:37.590 --> 35:40.756
We gave her transfusions
to treat the blood loss.

35:42.762 --> 35:45.050
But despite all that,
her heart stopped beating.

35:47.225 --> 35:48.339
No.

35:48.726 --> 35:53.222
We used intravenous drugs
and shocked her heart for an hour.

35:53.648 --> 35:56.317
But her injuries were too severe.

35:56.484 --> 35:57.813
No.

35:58.403 --> 35:59.601
And she died.

36:00.572 --> 36:02.315
No.

36:02.741 --> 36:03.772
I'm so sorry.

36:04.367 --> 36:07.452
- No!
- Okay...

36:08.163 --> 36:11.448
With the type of injuries she had
and the massive blood loss-

36:11.625 --> 36:13.285
- No!
- I'm sorry.

36:13.460 --> 36:16.081
- No! No!
- Calm down. Calm down.

36:16.255 --> 36:18.294
Just calm down.

36:19.258 --> 36:21.381
I'm sorry.

36:22.511 --> 36:25.512
I'm gonna have you take prednisone
for the next four days.

36:25.681 --> 36:27.259
Bishop, our car is here.

36:27.433 --> 36:30.849
Thank you. I'll be right there.

36:33.314 --> 36:34.808
What happened to Kevin Poole?

36:35.691 --> 36:37.020
The drunk?

36:37.985 --> 36:40.274
He died on the table.

36:40.988 --> 36:42.447
At least he found absolution.

36:44.742 --> 36:46.023
You don't believe that.

36:46.577 --> 36:48.535
He ran down a family in the street.

36:48.705 --> 36:50.282
The mother's upstairs in surgery.

36:50.707 --> 36:52.284
I see.

36:52.792 --> 36:55.118
Does that make him
any less worthy of salvation?

36:55.295 --> 36:57.038
He was more afraid than sorry.

36:57.213 --> 37:01.211
Yes. But he found God in his final
moments, and he asked for forgiveness.

37:01.927 --> 37:04.003
So any fool can get into heaven...

37:04.179 --> 37:07.762
...if he's scared enough to say
he's sorry right before he dies?

37:09.017 --> 37:10.725
Dr. Kovac...

37:12.187 --> 37:15.058
Everyone deserves to be comforted
in their darkest hour.

37:17.234 --> 37:21.184
Too bad you weren't there to comfort
the little girl he killed.

37:21.739 --> 37:25.238
I didn't need to be. God was there.

37:26.619 --> 37:27.899
Was he?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.661
You should arrange to see
your doctor this week.

37:37.964 --> 37:41.214
And use the cane for stability.

37:46.848 --> 37:50.798
Okay. Haleh, I am out of here.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.303
- Good night, Dr. Weaver.
- Good night.

37:53.480 --> 37:56.149
- Hey, can I give you a hand with those?
- Thank you.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.858
- You going home?
- Yeah, shortly.

37:58.026 --> 38:01.027
Hey, do you have a minute to talk?

38:01.196 --> 38:02.275
Of course.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.527
In there?

38:03.699 --> 38:05.027
Okay.

38:13.125 --> 38:16.292
If you're concerned about what
happened earlier, you don't need to be.

38:16.462 --> 38:20.045
- I respect your judgment enough to say-
- A couple weeks ago...

38:21.050 --> 38:25.427
...I took some Vicodin out of a patient's
prescription bottle and I swallowed them.

38:25.596 --> 38:29.546
And then I went into the bathroom
and I stuck my finger down my throat.

38:31.519 --> 38:35.220
Did you successfully expel them?

38:35.815 --> 38:37.309
Yes.

38:42.656 --> 38:46.654
I don't know- I don't know why
I did it. I really don't.

38:46.827 --> 38:51.323
I just found myself doing it.

38:52.749 --> 38:54.374
I just thought you should know.

38:56.837 --> 38:58.415
I appreciate you telling me.

38:59.381 --> 39:01.670
I'll see you tomorrow, Carter.

39:02.009 --> 39:03.207
What are you gonna do?

39:04.512 --> 39:06.469
Give it some thought.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.639
Meanwhile, keep going
to your meetings.

39:19.110 --> 39:21.019
I can't believe you waited.

39:21.195 --> 39:22.939
I thought you would have taken a cab.

39:23.114 --> 39:26.483
Well, I thought you could use
some company.

39:26.659 --> 39:27.904
Are you all right?

39:28.078 --> 39:31.992
Yeah. You should have seen me an
hour ago. I could have danced a jig.

39:32.165 --> 39:34.039
How did the meeting go?

39:35.877 --> 39:38.582
We settled rather cheaply.

39:38.755 --> 39:41.211
Something to do with a recall.

39:41.383 --> 39:45.297
Great. Shall we go out and celebrate?

39:45.470 --> 39:47.380
Get a bite to eat?

39:48.056 --> 39:49.385
What? With you like this?

39:49.558 --> 39:53.057
Or we could just go home,
take a nap.

39:53.228 --> 39:56.064
I don't feel like celebrating anyway.

39:56.732 --> 40:00.101
You're off the hook.
It's okay to be happy.

40:00.277 --> 40:03.148
I can't. It's my fault, Mark.

40:03.322 --> 40:06.407
Elizabeth, we're not saints, okay?

40:06.576 --> 40:09.695
We just try to get it right
as often as we can.

40:09.871 --> 40:12.077
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Elizabeth...

40:12.248 --> 40:14.371
Mark, please.

40:18.963 --> 40:20.790
You know what I noticed?

40:20.965 --> 40:22.246
What?

40:22.425 --> 40:25.759
Amy's shoes. They were brand-new.

40:25.929 --> 40:28.846
When she woke up this morning,
she had no idea.

40:29.224 --> 40:31.098
It's always harder when they're young.

40:31.268 --> 40:33.557
Yeah. So, what am I doing in Pedes?

40:33.729 --> 40:35.306
You're good at it.

40:35.480 --> 40:37.853
You know what I want tonight?

40:38.025 --> 40:40.314
Climb into a hot bath...

40:40.486 --> 40:42.146
...get in bed and be taken care of?

40:42.321 --> 40:44.479
I won't hold you to the last part.

40:56.002 --> 40:58.244
Oh, my God.

41:09.557 --> 41:12.262
Look what she did to my house.

41:16.147 --> 41:18.473
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

41:18.650 --> 41:21.568
No, it is not okay!

41:22.571 --> 41:26.521
- Look at this!
- I know. Come here. I'll take care of it.

41:49.849 --> 41:51.592
- Hey.
- Oh, hi.

41:51.768 --> 41:54.056
I was just about to leave,
if you want the table.

41:54.228 --> 41:57.597
Actually, I called your office
and they said you might be here.

41:57.774 --> 41:59.233
I was hoping that we could talk.

42:00.026 --> 42:02.232
I don't know.
We've already talked a lot today.

42:02.862 --> 42:06.860
I know that it's been tense between us
and I really don't mean it to be.

42:07.242 --> 42:08.736
I'm sure it'll pass.

42:09.244 --> 42:12.161
Kim, I want you to know
that I respect you as a colleague.

42:12.706 --> 42:13.986
Today notwithstanding?

42:14.916 --> 42:15.996
I miss you.

42:16.877 --> 42:18.454
Well, that'll pass too.

42:18.629 --> 42:21.795
In a few weeks we'll just be
friendly co-workers all over again.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.207
Yeah, I've been thinking...

42:25.386 --> 42:27.462
...and I'm not sure
that's what I want.

42:30.349 --> 42:34.561
- You have a good night. Okay?
- Kim, please.

42:42.236 --> 42:44.562
I'd like you to stay.

43:17.106 --> 43:18.897
Look...

43:19.316 --> 43:22.103
I know you might not
want to hear this right now.

43:24.238 --> 43:27.358
I know it's been rough
with everything...

43:31.037 --> 43:32.828
Between us.

43:37.668 --> 43:39.827
I'm not easy.

43:41.381 --> 43:43.706
I haven't been there for you.

43:44.968 --> 43:47.257
Not the way
you've been there for me.

43:49.055 --> 43:52.175
I've never worked at being
with someone.

43:53.768 --> 43:55.975
I've never even wanted to.

43:57.397 --> 44:00.315
But I want to with you.

44:03.028 --> 44:04.855
I love you.
