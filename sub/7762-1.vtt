[dramatic music]

01:03.131 --> 01:04.832
- IN A WORLD OF SHADOW,

AN ILLUSION.

01:57.651 --> 02:01.155
JUST...CHEAP THEATRICS.

YOUR FUCKING CELL PHONE.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.345
- WHAT'S UP?

03:31.379 --> 03:34.448
- JUST LYING HERE,
EATING A BAG OF DORITOS

03:34.482 --> 03:36.984
READING
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.352
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

03:38.386 --> 03:40.754
- ANNA KARENINA AND PRINGLES.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.324
- [chuckles]
I ALWAYS SAID

03:43.357 --> 03:44.758
IT WAS OUR LOVE
OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE

03:44.792 --> 03:46.660
AND SNACKS HIGH
IN SATURATED FAT

03:46.694 --> 03:49.397
THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.764
- [chuckles]
SO HOW'S WORK?

03:50.798 --> 03:52.733
- UP TO MY ASS
IN STORYBOARDS,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.868

HE SAYS HE NEVER
COULD'VE ENVISIONED

03:56.370 --> 03:57.771
THE PROJECT WITHOUT ME.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.608
HE'S EVEN TALKING
ABOUT A SEQUEL.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.610
- MY SUPERHERO.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.911
- ONLY TROUBLE IS,

04:03.944 --> 04:05.946
PREPRODUCTION IS SLOWER
THAN WE EXPECTED.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.916
SO I MIGHT HAVE TO STAY LONGER
THAN I THOUGHT.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.753
- HOW MUCH LONGER?

04:12.786 --> 04:16.490
- ANOTHER THREE MONTHS,
MAYBE FOUR.

04:16.524 --> 04:19.026
THE STUDIO IS SCREAMING,
BUT BRETT SAYS NOT TO WORRY,

04:19.059 --> 04:22.663
THAT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.632
YOU'RE NOT PISSED,
ARE YOU?

04:24.665 --> 04:27.368
- WHY THE FUCK
WOULD I BE PISSED?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.036
I TOLD YOU BEFORE
YOU WENT OUT THERE,

04:29.069 --> 04:31.839
THE ONLY REASON I'D BE PISSED
IS IF YOU DIDN'T GO.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.375
- SO WHEN ARE YOU
COMING OUT HERE?

04:34.408 --> 04:37.378
YOU'D FUCKING LOVE IT.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.648

WHEN I JUST MIGHT DROP IN.

OF MEL'S THAT I DON'T HAVE.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.441
- MM, WELL, SHE'S SO YOUNG.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.875
IT'S HARD TO TELL EXACTLY
WHO SHE LOOKS LIKE.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.110
- AT THIS POINT,
SHE'S JUST

05:43.143 --> 05:45.112
A SLEEP, EAT,
AND POOP MACHINE.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.847
- OH, YEAH,

SWEET DREAMS, HONEY BUN.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.723
- "HONEY BUN"?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.157
- THAT'S JUST WHAT MY MOTHER
USED TO CALL ME.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.792
WHICH REMINDS ME,

05:58.826 --> 05:59.993
SHE SAID TO TELL YOU
THAT SHE'S COMING BY

06:00.027 --> 06:01.462
TOMORROW TO SEE THE BABY.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.731
- OH. WOULD YOU HAVE HER
CALL FIRST?

06:03.764 --> 06:05.466
- SHE'S NOT PESTERING YOU,
IS SHE?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.900
'CAUSE IF SHE IS,
JUST TELL ME.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.636
I HATE WHEN SHE PESTERS.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.404
ARE YOU SURE YOU GUYS
DON'T NEED ANY GROCERIES?

06:10.438 --> 06:12.473
GOT ENOUGH DIAPERS?
WHAT ABOUT TALCUM POWDER?

UNDER CONTROL.

AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

06:16.810 --> 06:18.879
THEY'RE LIKE
A FINE-TUNED MACHINE.

I CAN'T WAIT TO BE
AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.015

IT'S NICE TO BE
NEWLYWEDS TOO.

- 200.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.156
- TEN.
THIS WEEK, ACTUALLY.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.891
- TEN'S A BIGGIE.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.159
DID YOU PLAN ANYTHING SPECIAL?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.494
- WE'RE TAKING A PASS
THIS YEAR.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.028
- TOO TIRED, TOO BUSY.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.830

06:53.947 --> 06:56.784
YOU WERE GOOD.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.919
- SO WERE YOU.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.955
- PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.661
- BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TELL THEM EVENTUALLY.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.530
THEY HAVE TO KNOW
I'M NOT LIVING HERE.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.565
- OF COURSE
THEY NEED TO KNOW.

07:11.599 --> 07:12.800
AND THEY WILL.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.902
EVENTUALLY.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.559
- I JUST WANT TO GRAB SOME
PANTYHOSE AND MY LASAGNA PAN.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.694
- I DON'T THINK I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THE PANTYHOSE,

07:40.728 --> 07:43.764
BUT DON'T I HAVE ENOUGH PANS
AT MY HOUSE?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.033
- WHAT, THAT OLD COLLECTION
OF TV DINNER TINS?

07:46.066 --> 07:47.835
- [chuckles]
- AND SPEAKING OF COLLECTIONS,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.269
I GOT TO REMEMBER TO BRING
MY GLASS CLOWNS.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.105
- WAIT. YOU JUST
BROUGHT OVER ALL THOSE OWLS

07:52.139 --> 07:55.008
WITH ALL THOSE...EYES.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.777
[sighs]

07:56.810 --> 07:58.579
WITH ALL THE STUFF
YOU'VE BEEN HAULING OVER,

07:58.612 --> 08:00.648
WE MIGHT
AS WELL BE LIVING HERE.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.785
- CARL?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.253
- WHAT?

08:06.286 --> 08:08.121
- [exhales] SHIT.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.923
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SAY THIS.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.760
- YOU? NOT KNOW HOW
TO SAY SOMETHING?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.733
- IT'S ABOUT YOUR PLACE.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.734
- WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH MY PLACE?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.035
- NOTHING.
NO, NO.

08:22.069 --> 08:26.073
NOTHING'S THE MATTER
WITH YOUR PLACE.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.809
IT'S JUST...

08:28.842 --> 08:31.211
IT'S NOT THIS PLACE.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.146
- WE'VE HAD
ENDLESS DISCUSSIONS

08:33.180 --> 08:34.748
ABOUT WHERE
WE WERE GOING TO LIVE.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.884
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO BE HERE.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.085
THERE WERE
TOO MANY SAD MEMORIES.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.753
- IT'S TRUE,
AND AT THE TIME,

08:39.787 --> 08:43.223
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT
WAS LOSING VIC.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.925
BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE,

08:44.958 --> 08:47.027
ALL THE HAPPY MEMORIES ARE
STARTING TO COMING BACK,

08:47.060 --> 08:49.863
AND THEY'RE EVEN BEATING
OUT THE SAD ONES.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.705
I'VE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE
ALMOST 30 YEARS.

08:57.738 --> 09:01.909
IT'S PRACTICALLY
ALL OF MICHAEL'S LIFE.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.110
THERE WERE DAYS
WHEN WE COULD BARELY

09:03.143 --> 09:05.813
MUSTER UP THE MORTGAGE AND...

09:05.846 --> 09:07.781
AND DAYS WHEN WE PARTIED
ALL NIGHT LONG,

09:07.815 --> 09:09.917
AND THAT DIDN'T EVEN COUNT
BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.852
[chuckles]

09:15.088 --> 09:19.226
THIS HOUSE IS A PART OF ME.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.930
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN AWAY
FROM IT UNTIL NOW.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.798
THERE'S NOTHING,
NOTHING WRONG

09:24.832 --> 09:26.066
WITH YOUR PLACE, SWEETHEART.

09:26.099 --> 09:30.838
I'VE LOVED BEING THERE
WITH YOU.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.573
BUT I WANT TO COME HOME.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.881
- HONEY...

09:40.914 --> 09:43.851
IT'S LIKE I SAID
FROM THE START.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.286
IT'S UP TO YOU.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.723
WHEREVER YOU ARE
IS HOME TO ME.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.826
- REALLY?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.294
REALLY?
[sniffles]

09:54.327 --> 09:55.395
THANK YOU.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.164
THANK YOU.
- [chuckles]

09:59.933 --> 10:02.035
- OH, YEAH!
[grunts]

10:08.275 --> 10:11.745
[glass shatters]

10:19.152 --> 10:21.955
- WELCOME HOME.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.727
- YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME
YOU SEE A STUFFED ANIMAL,

10:26.760 --> 10:27.861
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.129
- I CAN'T HELP IT.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.799
I WANT MY GIRL
TO HAVE EVERYTHING.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.301
- EXCUSE US.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.071
WHAT ARE THEY GIVING ME
A LOOK FOR?

10:38.105 --> 10:39.773
THIS ISN'T
A FUCKING BACK ROOM.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.142
- THAT PARTY HAS BEEN
GOING ON SINCE LAST NIGHT.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.945
[dance music]

10:44.978 --> 10:45.913
- MICHAEL.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.315
- JUST CURIOUS.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.017
FAGS PACKED TO THE RAFTERS.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.084
ONE OF THEM LOOKS JUST LIKE--

10:51.118 --> 10:53.220
- HEY, DUDES, YOU'RE HOME.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.022
- WHY AREN'T YOU?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.356
- JASON AND TROY ASKED ME

10:56.389 --> 10:57.891
IF WE HAD
THE NEW CHRISTINA AGUILERA CD,

10:57.925 --> 10:59.426
SO I LOANED THEM YOURS.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.061
- THAT'LL BE THE LAST
WE SEE OF THAT,

11:01.094 --> 11:02.195
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.831
- YOU DON'T BELONG OVER THERE,

11:03.864 --> 11:05.332
WITH GUYS WHO'VE BEEN
PARTYING ALL NIGHT.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.434
- I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE NEIGHBORLY

11:07.467 --> 11:09.202
AND MAYBE COP A LITTLE WEED.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.470
- YOU SHOULD BE STUDYING
FOR YOUR MIDTERMS.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.941
- CRACK THOSE BOOKS, PAL.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.178
- HERE, GIVE ME THE ICE CREAM.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.048
I'LL PUT IT IN THE FREEZER.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.717
DID THEY SEEM KIND OF CRANKY
TO YOU?

11:23.751 --> 11:25.819
- WHO?
- MEL AND LINZ.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.821
- NO MORE THAN USUAL.

11:27.855 --> 11:31.191
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE BOTH PROBABLY EXHAUSTED.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.826
- THEY MUST BE,
NOT TO WANT TO CELEBRATE

11:32.860 --> 11:34.327
THEIR TENTH ANNIVERSARY.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.929
- BETWEEN BREAST-FEEDING
AND CHANGING DIAPERS,

11:35.963 --> 11:37.130
I'M SURE PLANNING
A CELEBRATION

11:37.164 --> 11:39.232
IS THE LAST THOUGHT
ON THEIR MINDS.

11:39.266 --> 11:43.103
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD
THINK OF IT FOR THEM.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.842
- I HOPE
ON OUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY

11:48.876 --> 11:52.846
WE'RE NOT TOO TIRED
TO CELEBRATE.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.983
- I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.087
- HEY.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.288
I THOUGHT
WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED,

12:01.321 --> 12:03.390
YOU FUCKED LESS.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.198
- HMM.
- MM.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.969
- THAT'S PERFECT.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.437
YEAH, WE'LL GO WITH THAT ONE.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.840
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL CALL THE CLIENT.

12:19.873 --> 12:24.978
[indistinct chatter]

12:25.012 --> 12:27.247
- COUNTING DOWN
THE HOURS, BRI?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.282
I'D BE TOO,
YOU LUCKY BASTARD.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.319
ZOOMING OFF TO LOS ANGELES
FOR A LITTLE SUNSHINE.

12:32.352 --> 12:36.857
WELL, MM,
BEFORE YOU FLY AWAY,

12:36.890 --> 12:39.392
WE NEED TO GO OVER
SOME FIGURES.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.130
- HOW MANY BEAR CLAWS
YOU'VE CONSUMED THIS MORNING?

12:43.163 --> 12:45.198
- I'M WRITING DOWN A NUMBER.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.400
- OH, I GET IT, I'M SUPPOSED
TO GUESS WHAT IT IS?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.071
THEN WHAT, WE BECOME
THE NEW SIEGFRIED AND ROY?

12:53.907 --> 12:56.844
- THAT'S HOW MUCH KINNETIK
MADE LAST QUARTER.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.282
- IT'S NOT TOO SHABBY.
- NOT TOO SHABBY?

13:02.315 --> 13:04.918
FOR BEING IN BUSINESS A YEAR,
IT'S OVER THE FUCKING MOON!

13:04.952 --> 13:07.287
SO WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO WITH IT?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.923
- OH, IT'S ALL YOURS.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.359
- I MEANT THE PROFITS.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.894
OF COURSE,
YOU COULD ALWAYS PUMP IT

13:13.927 --> 13:15.428
BACK INTO THE BUSINESS,

13:15.462 --> 13:17.430
BUT I'D CAUTION YOU
AGAINST EXPANDING TOO QUICKLY.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.033
- I MIGHT SAY
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

13:20.067 --> 13:23.336
- AS FAR AS STOCKS AND BONDS,
YOU KNOW, TO GET A GOOD RATE,

13:23.370 --> 13:25.438
YOU'D HAVE TO GO OUT TO
THE MIDDLE OF THE 24TH CENTURY.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.941
- SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

13:29.342 --> 13:31.945
- THE BEST INVESTMENT
THERE IS.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.047
YOURSELF.
SPEND IT ON YOU.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.482
YOU'VE WORKED
LIKE A SON OF A BITCH.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.985
YOU WENT THROUGH HELL
AND BACK WITH YOUR, UH--

13:38.018 --> 13:39.452
BUT THANK GOD
YOU'RE OKAY,

13:39.486 --> 13:41.955
SO TREAT YOURSELF
TO SOMETHING SPECIAL.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.957
GO BUY A NEW TOY.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.059
- I'VE GOT DILDOS
UP THE ASS.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.061
- I MEAN
THAT LITTLE EXTRAVAGANCE

13:48.095 --> 13:49.863
YOU THOUGHT
YOU COULD NEVER AFFORD,

13:49.897 --> 13:53.633
LIKE A SHINY RED FERRARI

13:53.666 --> 13:56.336
OR PERHAPS A WARHOL
TO HANG IN THE LOFT

13:56.369 --> 13:58.538
OR HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
FOR JUSTIN?

13:58.571 --> 14:01.308
LIKE HIS OWN
PERSONAL LEARJET,

14:01.341 --> 14:05.612
SO HE CAN WING BACK AND FORTH
FROM THE COAST TO VISIT YOU?

14:05.645 --> 14:07.280
AH, I'M SURE YOU'LL COME UP
WITH SOMETHING...

14:07.314 --> 14:09.616
- [clears throat]
- TO DELIGHT YOURSELF WITH.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.318
MM...HMM.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.958
- HE'S SO CUTE.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.492
- I'M DEVON'S
BIOLOGICAL FATHER,

14:19.526 --> 14:21.494
AND MONTY IS
ONDINE'S BIO DAD.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.096
SAME MOM HOWEVER.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.132
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US
THAT THEY BE RELATED.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.566
- FINALLY GOT THE KIDS DOWN.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.168
I HAD TO SING UNDER THE SEA

14:28.201 --> 14:29.369
SIX TIMES.
- [laughs] OH.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.504
- YOU DO PERFORM IT
BRILLIANTLY.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.574
- YOUR KIDS ARE SO ADORABLE.
- YEAH. THANKS.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.044
ELI TELLS ME
YOU JUST HAD ONE OF YOUR OWN.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.646
- JENNY REBECCA.
BUT WE CALL HER J.R.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.115
- I LOVE THAT.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.516
- BUT WE'RE NOT PARENTING
LIKE YOU.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.118
- NO. MELANIE AND LINDSAY,
OUR LESBIAN FRIENDS,

14:45.152 --> 14:46.119
ARE THE PRIMARY PARENTS.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.520
- WELL, IF YOU EVER DO DECIDE

14:47.554 --> 14:49.056
TO RAISE ONE OF YOUR OWN,

14:49.089 --> 14:50.523
THIS IS THE PERFECT NEIGHBORHOOD
TO DO IT.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.192
WE HAVE A HUGE BACKYARD.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.660
- THERE'S A GYMBOREE
DOWN THE BLOCK.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.428
- AND THEY'RE EVEN
PUTTING IN A BABY GAP.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.997
- OH.
- IT'S FUNNY.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.298
WHEN I WAS A KID,
WE WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED

14:58.331 --> 14:59.299
TO COME OVER HERE.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.567
IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.135
- NOW THE ONLY DANGER IS
IF THEY RUN OUT

15:02.169 --> 15:04.471
OF WASABI PEAS AT WHOLE FOODS.
[chuckles]

15:04.504 --> 15:07.607
- YEAH, LEAVE IT TO THE QUEERS
TO TURN DROSS INTO GOLD.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.409
- THAT'S NO FAIRY TALE.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.211
EVER SINCE THE GAYS
MOVED IN,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.479
STARTED FIXING THINGS UP,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.314
REAL ESTATE PRICES
HAVE SOARED.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.617
- YOU GUYS EVER THINK
ABOUT MOVING?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.086
[horn honks]

15:19.119 --> 15:21.088
[indistinct chatter]

15:21.121 --> 15:25.025
- HI! OH, MY GOD.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

15:25.058 --> 15:30.163
[indistinct chatter]

15:30.197 --> 15:32.365
- IT'S LIKE A DIFFERENT WORLD,
ISN'T IT?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.301
- BETWEEN HERE
AND WHERE ELI AND MONTY LIVE?

15:34.334 --> 15:36.569
- HMM. YOU WANT TO STOP IN
FOR A DRINK?

15:36.603 --> 15:40.173
- OH, I'VE GOT
A LECTURE TO PREPARE.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.176
SO HOW'D YOU LIKE
THEIR HOUSE?

15:43.210 --> 15:45.245
- THEY DID A GREAT JOB.
- YEAH.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.579
- IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH
THAT NEIGHBORHOOD HAS CHANGED.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.448
- UGH, I WISH
THIS ONE WOULD.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.183
- WHAT'S A USED CONDOM OR TWO?

15:50.217 --> 15:51.351
- BESIDES, THE APARTMENT IS

15:51.384 --> 15:52.619
TOO SMALL
FOR THE THREE OF US,

15:52.652 --> 15:54.454
AND THAT BUILDING'S
LIKE A GAY DORM.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.123
- IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
- WELL, NOT IF YOU'RE 24

15:56.156 --> 15:58.992
AND WANT TO FUCK EVERYTHING
THAT MOVES, OR BRIAN.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.527
HA, WE'RE PAST ALL THAT,
AREN'T WE?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.262
- SURE.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.197
- SO, UH...

16:04.231 --> 16:05.598
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT GETTING
A PLACE OF OUR OWN?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.200
- YOU REALLY WANT TO MOVE?

16:07.234 --> 16:08.501
- WELL, I BET
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,

16:08.535 --> 16:10.003
WE COULD AFFORD IT.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.239
- MAYBE SO,
BUT THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE,

16:12.272 --> 16:14.074
WHERE I'VE LIVED
MY WHOLE LIFE.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.342
I-I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT
TO PICK UP AND LEAVE,

16:15.375 --> 16:18.145
JUST LIKE THAT.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.248
- WELL, IT WAS
JUST A THOUGHT.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.516
- "CHARMING,
SPACIOUS APARTMENT TO SHARE,

16:23.550 --> 16:26.386
"OWN BEDROOM, PRIVATE BATH,
NO PETS,

16:26.419 --> 16:29.089
BOTTOMS ONLY NEED APPLY."

16:29.122 --> 16:30.423
PERFECT.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.492
- SO WHO ASKED YOU TO LEAVE,
DEB OR HORVATH?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.494
- NEITHER.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.363
- THE LOOK ON THEIR FACES
MUST HAVE BEEN PRICELESS

16:36.396 --> 16:38.131
WHEN THEY FOUND
YOU ENTERTAINING.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.633
- DEB WANTED TO WATCH
AND HAVE A Q&A AFTERWARDS.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.402
- NO DOUBT.
WHAT ABOUT HORVATH?

16:42.435 --> 16:45.105
- DID YOU EVER SEE THE BLOB?
- MM-HMM.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.639
- REMEMBER THE LOOK
ON THE OLD FARMER'S FACE

16:46.673 --> 16:47.774
JUST BEFORE IT DEVOURED HIM?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.109
- "AAH!"

16:49.142 --> 16:50.443
- MM-HMM.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.512
SO I'VE DECIDED
TO SPARE EVERYONE

16:52.545 --> 16:54.647
THE DISCOMFORT OF GOING THROUGH
ANOTHER EMBARRASSING SCENE,

16:54.681 --> 16:59.386
QUIETLY FOLD MY TENT,
AND MOVE ON.

16:59.419 --> 17:03.156
TEDDY, HOW MANY OF
THOSE POWER BARS HAVE YOU HAD?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.658
- WHO'S COUNTING?
- I AM.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.794
AND THAT'S YOUR FOURTH.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.562
DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER
OF CARBS IN THOSE THINGS,

17:09.596 --> 17:12.132
NOT TO MENTION THE CALORIES?
- SO I'LL BURN THEM OFF.

17:12.165 --> 17:16.269
- HONEY, YOU'D HAVE
TO GO UP IN FLAMES.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.405
LOOK, I-I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS,

17:18.438 --> 17:20.707
SO PLEASE, PLEASE PROMISE ME

17:20.740 --> 17:22.709
YOU WON'T TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.677
BUT AS YOUR FRIEND,
I FEEL IT'S MY OBLIGATION

17:24.711 --> 17:27.614
TO TELL YOU,
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE, UM...

17:27.647 --> 17:29.582
- A LITTLE WHAT?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.485
- A LITTLE...HEARTY.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.355
I-I MEAN, UH,
RO-ROBUST.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.091
I MEAN...
- FAT.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.427
- FAT?
WHA--YOU THINK I'M FAT?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.828
- WELL,
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.297
IF YOU START SINGING,
IT'S ALL OVER.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.366
- LOOK, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
I'M NOT FAT.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.102
I'M JUST--I'M--
I'M BULKING UP.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.737
YOU KNOW, I WAS A SHADOW
OF MY FORMER SELF

17:50.770 --> 17:51.871
WHEN I WAS ON CRYSTAL,

17:51.904 --> 17:53.173
AND I SHED
QUITE A FEW POUNDS

17:53.206 --> 17:54.574
DURING THE LIBERTY RIDE.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.510
AND I HAPPEN TO THINK
I LOOK PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.251
AND OBVIOUSLY...

18:04.284 --> 18:06.486
SO DOES HE.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.055
HMM.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.225
- WHO KNEW YOU COULD
CATCH TWINKIES

18:12.259 --> 18:13.393
BY STUFFING THEM
IN YOUR MOUTH?

18:13.426 --> 18:14.761
- HI.
- HEY.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.496
- HOW ARE YOU?

18:16.529 --> 18:18.531
- ALL RIGHT,
I'M OFF TO FIND NEW DIGS.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.334
TA!

18:21.368 --> 18:22.602
- HEY.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.137
SHALL WE TAKE A PEEK
IN THE STEAM ROOM

18:24.171 --> 18:25.472
AND SEE WHAT'S
LURKING IN THE MIST?

18:25.505 --> 18:26.806
- CAN'T.
BRETT'S CALLING FROM L.A.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.741
WANTS MY INPUT
ON A COUPLE OF STORY POINTS

18:28.775 --> 18:30.510
FOR THE SCREENPLAY.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.612
YOU KNOW,
STUFF RAGE MIGHT SAY.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.814
- HMM, LIKE, "ZOWIE, ZEPHYR,

18:34.847 --> 18:38.251
CHECK OUT THAT SUPER COCK"?

18:38.285 --> 18:40.520
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- [chuckles]

18:40.553 --> 18:42.789
- BESIDES, I-I THOUGHT
YOU HAD A PLANE TO CATCH.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.492
JUSTIN'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED
WHEN YOU SHOW UP.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.794
- I'M NOT GOING.
TRIP'S CANCELED.

18:47.827 --> 18:48.928
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU HAD

18:48.961 --> 18:50.430
ALL THESE PLANS
TO SURPRISE HIM.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.365
- WELL,
I GUESS THE SURPRISE IS,

18:52.399 --> 18:56.769
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ONE.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.638
- REVEREND SWINEHART,

18:58.671 --> 19:01.808
RAGE'S NEMESIS AND SWORN ENEMY
OF QUEERS EVERYWHERE,

19:01.841 --> 19:04.677
PREACHES HIS MESSAGE
OF HATE FROM HIS PULPIT,

19:04.711 --> 19:07.180
WHILE DEEP IN THE CATACOMBS
OF THE CHURCH,

19:07.214 --> 19:10.317
RAGE HANGS SUSPENDED
ABOVE THE FLAMES,

19:10.350 --> 19:13.853
HIS HANDS BOUND IN
REALLY HOT LEATHER RESTRAINTS.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.690
MEANWHILE, J.T. RACES
TO THE RESCUE.

19:21.428 --> 19:23.596
- MR. KELLER SAYS
THEY NEED THE STORYBOARDS

19:23.630 --> 19:25.698
FOR THE CATACOMB SEQUENCE
NOW, NOW, NOW.

19:25.732 --> 19:30.870
- TELL HIM I'M HURRYING
AS FAST AS I CAN, CAN, CAN.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.939
AND PRAY MY HAND HOLDS OUT.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.409
[indistinct chatter]

19:36.443 --> 19:38.678
- YOU LOOK ALL OUT OF BREATH.
- [chuckles]

19:38.711 --> 19:40.680
I'M JUST TRYING TO FINISH
THESE STORYBOARDS

19:40.713 --> 19:42.749
FOR A CERTAIN
DEMANDING TYRANT.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.485
- OH, THOSE? FORGET IT.
I'VE GOT INCREDIBLE NEWS.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.487
AND OTHER THAN A LEGION
OF STUDIO EXECUTIVES,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.556
AGENTS, PUBLICISTS, MANAGERS,

19:49.589 --> 19:50.690
AND BOTH TRADE PAPERS,

19:50.723 --> 19:53.293
YOU ARE
THE VERY FIRST TO HEAR IT.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.994
WE JUST SIGNED SOMEONE
TO PLAY RAGE.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.963
- WHO? WHO?

19:56.996 --> 19:58.465
- THIS IS THE MOVIES.

19:58.498 --> 20:02.702
INSTEAD OF TELLING YOU,
I'LL SHOW YOU.

20:02.735 --> 20:03.970
- CONNOR.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.972
- HEY, MAN.
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.440
- OH, HE'S JUST BACK
FROM DOING

20:07.474 --> 20:09.309
A KABUKI VERSION
OF MUCH ADO

20:09.342 --> 20:11.844
OFF-OFF-OFF-
OFF BROADWAY.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.513
- WHAT A CHANGE FROM WORKING
WITH THOSE HOLLYWOOD HACKS

20:13.546 --> 20:15.715
WHO ASPIRE TO NOTHING
MORE THAN MEDIOCRITY.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.916
- STILL, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEM

20:16.949 --> 20:19.352
PICKING UP THAT PAYCHECK,
DO YOU?

20:19.386 --> 20:21.454
WELL, GET READY TO DO
SOME SERIOUS ACTING.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.391
WE START FLYING LESSONS
ON MONDAY.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.592
- I THOUGHT
YOU TURNED DOWN THE PART.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.893
- OH, THE DIRECTOR
CONVINCED ME

20:26.926 --> 20:28.528
IT'D BE GOOD
FOR MY CAREER.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.862
SHOW EVERYONE
I'M A STRAIGHT GUY

20:29.896 --> 20:32.332
WHO HAS NO PROBLEMS
PLAYING GAY FOR PAY.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.468
- [chuckles]

20:35.502 --> 20:37.670
- ALL RIGHT,
STUFFED EGGPLANT,

20:37.704 --> 20:41.641
CAPRESE SALAD, HUMMUS,
AND THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE--

20:41.674 --> 20:43.643
FRIED CHICKEN, WHICH IS
NOT REALLY FRIED BUT BAKED,

20:43.676 --> 20:44.644
BUT IT'S BAKED TO TASTE
LIKE FRIED,

20:44.677 --> 20:45.745
SO NOBODY FEELS GUILTY.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.280
- MEL AND LINZ
ARE GONNA GO OUT

20:47.314 --> 20:48.648
OF THEIR MINDS
WHEN WE SHOW UP.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.916
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH
FOR ALL THIS, EM.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.819
- MY PLEASURE, SWEETIE.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.354
WHAT'S THIS?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.523
- OH, A CASSEROLE
I MADE TO TAKE ALONG.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.391
MILLET, LEEKS,
AND SOY CHEESE.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.560
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE NOT A LESBIAN?

21:00.593 --> 21:01.928
OOPSIE.
[giggles]

21:01.961 --> 21:03.396
- KITCHEN'S SO TINY,

21:03.430 --> 21:04.964
YOU CAN BARELY TURN AROUND.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.967
- CARE TO DANCE?
- [laughs]

21:08.000 --> 21:09.536
- WHICH ISN'T TOO MUCH
OF A STRETCH

21:09.569 --> 21:11.538
CONSIDERING BABY BABYLON
BLASTING ACROSS THE WAY.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.574
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.644
- WHY ARE HIS FIRM,
MANLY TITS IN A TWIST?

21:17.677 --> 21:18.845
- HE THINKS THE BUILDING'S

21:18.878 --> 21:19.912
TURNING INTO A DEN
OF INIQUITY:

21:19.946 --> 21:21.581
SEX, DRUGS, CRUISING.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.550
- OKAY, SO THOSE ARE
THE ADVANTAGES.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.984
WHAT ARE THE LIABILITIES?

21:25.017 --> 21:27.854
- THAT BASICALLY
WE'VE OUTGROWN THIS PLACE.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.055
- WELL, LET'S FACE IT,
HONEY, YOU ARE...

21:29.088 --> 21:30.823
"SADIE, SADIE, MARRIED LADY"

21:30.857 --> 21:33.460
WITH A HUBBY
AND PIGLETS TO PROVE IT.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.095
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
REMAIN WANTONLY SINGLE.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.431
SO IF YOU'RE MOVING OUT,
MAYBE I SHOULD MOVE BACK IN.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.832
- WE'RE NOT MOVING.

21:39.866 --> 21:43.803
[dance music,
indistinct shouting]

21:43.836 --> 21:45.538
- WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.006
IT'S LIKE HOMO CENTRAL.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.875
- BITE ME.
- CALM DOWN.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.410
THEY'RE JUST YOUNG
AND HAVING FUN.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.711
WE WERE THAT AGE ONCE,
REMEMBER?

21:51.744 --> 21:52.879
- YEAH, THAT'S
EXACTLY THE POINT.

21:52.912 --> 21:53.980
WE'RE NOT THAT AGE ANYMORE.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.815
IT'S TIME TO MOVE TO A HOUSE

21:55.848 --> 21:57.550
ON A STREET
LIKE ELI AND MONTY.

21:57.584 --> 21:58.885
- BUYING A HOUSE IS NOT
LIKE BUYING

21:58.918 --> 22:00.086
A CD OR A SWEATER.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.721
EVEN IF WE DID
DECIDE TO DO IT,

22:01.754 --> 22:03.089
FIRST, WE'D HAVE TO REVIEW
OUR FINANCES,

22:03.122 --> 22:05.425
CHECK OUT THE NUMBERS.
RIGHT, EM?

22:05.458 --> 22:08.495
- OH, I'D SAY CHECKING OUT
THE NUMBERS IS ESSENTIAL.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.431
- HEY, THERE, SEXY.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.965
- WELL, TRYING TO DISPOSE
OF A LARGE SUM

22:12.999 --> 22:14.834
OF EXPENDABLE INCOME
IS MORE EXHAUSTING

22:14.867 --> 22:16.135
THAN ONE MIGHT THINK.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.471
- WHO EVER SAID
THE WORLD WAS FAIR?

22:18.505 --> 22:19.706
NEXT TIME YOU'LL THINK TWICE

22:19.739 --> 22:22.609
BEFORE BECOMING A SUCCESS.
- OH.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.778
YOU'RE NOT DOING
SO BAD YOURSELF.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.114
- BEN WANTS US TO BUY
A HOUSE IN THAT NEW AREA

22:28.147 --> 22:30.049
WHERE ALL THE GAY COUPLES
ARE MOVING.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.752
- OH, AND BECOME
STEPFORD FAGS?

22:32.785 --> 22:34.020
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET A NEW PLACE,

22:34.053 --> 22:35.788
A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.725
- I HATE THE FUCKING COUNTRY.
- A YACHT?

22:38.758 --> 22:42.128
- RIGHT, PITTSBURGH,
THE NEW SAINT-TROPEZ.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.130
- A RIDE ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE?

22:44.163 --> 22:47.133
- I'M A TAD SHY
OF 20 MILL.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.801
- THEN HOW
ABOUT A BOTTLE OF WINE

22:48.835 --> 22:51.070
FOR MEL AND LINZ'S
ANNIVERSARY BASH?

22:51.103 --> 22:53.640
- WHO SAYS I'LL BE THERE?

22:53.673 --> 22:55.542
- WELL, I FIGURED
SINCE YOU CANCELED YOUR TRIP--

22:55.575 --> 22:57.610
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M GONNA BE RAISING A GLASS

22:57.644 --> 23:01.047
TO THEIR MARATHON
MUFFATHON.

23:03.550 --> 23:07.520
THAT...IS
A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.755
- HMM.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.790
- CAN YOU IMAGINE
EATING PUSSY,

23:10.823 --> 23:13.893
THE SAME PUSSY,
FOR TEN YEARS?

23:13.926 --> 23:15.628
- NO, BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE
THEY COULD FATHOM

23:15.662 --> 23:18.030
SUCKING THE SAME COCK.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.766
- THAT MAKES THREE OF US.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.702
- UNLESS IT'S JUSTIN'S.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.839
IT'S A SHAME
YOU COULDN'T GO TO L.A.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.841
- I'M BUSY, HE'S BUSY.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.777
- WE'RE ALL BUSY.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.044
I JUST HOPE HE GETS BACK SOON,

23:32.078 --> 23:33.646
SO WE CAN FINISH
THE NEXT ISSUE OF RAGE.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.549
- HE'S NOT COMING BACK.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.184
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HE'S NOT COMING BACK?

23:38.217 --> 23:40.219
DID HE TELL YOU THAT?
- HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.188
- WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM,
ALL HE SAID WAS THAT

23:42.221 --> 23:43.590
HE WAS GONNA TO HAVE
TO BE THERE LONGER THAN HE--

23:43.623 --> 23:46.225
- LISTEN, MIKEY.
ARE YOU LISTENING?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.927
- YES, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
I'M LISTENING!

23:47.960 --> 23:49.228
- JUST FIGURE IT OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.229
I MEAN, FIRST,
IT'S THREE MONTHS.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.831
THEN IT'S SIX MONTHS.

23:51.864 --> 23:54.233
ONE PROJECT TURNS
INTO ANOTHER AND ANOTHER.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.668
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,

23:55.702 --> 23:57.937
HE'S THERE A YEAR,

23:57.970 --> 23:59.071
FIVE YEARS.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.640
- [gasps]

24:04.243 --> 24:06.579
- THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.218
I MEAN, I DON'T BLAME HIM.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.820
HE'S HAVING
THE TIME OF HIS LIFE,

24:13.853 --> 24:15.555
WORKING IN THE MOVIES,

24:15.588 --> 24:17.624
HE'S FUCKING MOVIE STARS.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.135
- WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S NEVER COMING HOME.

24:29.168 --> 24:32.138
- WHO THE HELL WOULD COME BACK
TO PITTSBURGH AFTER L.A.?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.173
I MEAN, IF IT WAS ME,
I'D NEVER COME BACK.

24:34.206 --> 24:38.645
[sirens wail]

24:38.678 --> 24:40.880
- HE'S NOT YOU.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.518
- WELL...

24:45.552 --> 24:46.919
IT'S TIME
HE GOT ON WITH HIS LIFE.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.889
IT'S TIME
I GOT ON WITH MINE.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.263
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW SOMEONE SO LITTLE

24:57.296 --> 24:59.298
COULD HAVE
SO MUCH POOP IN THEM.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.902
YOU MIGHT JUST GROW UP
TO BE A LAWYER.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.904
[knock on door]

25:11.110 --> 25:12.745
- HEY, MEL.

25:12.779 --> 25:15.214
- HEY, MICHAEL.
- WHAT YOU UP TO?

25:15.247 --> 25:17.684
- CHANGING YOU-KNOW-WHOSE
YOU-KNOW-WHAT

25:17.717 --> 25:19.619
FOR THE BILLIONTH TIME TODAY.

25:19.652 --> 25:20.620
- IS THAT HOW
YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND

25:20.653 --> 25:21.754
YOUR TENTH ANNIVERSARY?

25:21.788 --> 25:23.289
- YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

25:23.322 --> 25:24.824
- AS A MATTER OF FACT...

25:24.857 --> 25:26.759
all: SURPRISE!

25:26.793 --> 25:28.795
[laughter]

25:28.828 --> 25:30.029
- SURPRISE.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.199
OH,
HOW'S MY GRANDDAUGHTER?

25:33.232 --> 25:35.301
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOREVER.

25:35.334 --> 25:36.903
- OH, YEAH,
NOT SINCE THIS MORNING.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.170
- HI, THERE, SWEETHEART.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.238
- WIPE
THE "DYKE IN THE HEADLIGHTS"

25:39.271 --> 25:40.306
LOOK OFF YOUR FACE.

25:40.339 --> 25:41.908
YOU'RE HAVING A SURPRISE PARTY,

25:41.941 --> 25:43.242
COURTESY OF AUNTIE EM'S
SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.711
- AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO LIFT A FINGER.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.045
EVERYTHING'S BEEN
TAKEN CARE OF.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.179
- HEY, HAPPY TENTH, MEL.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.982
- FOOD IN THE DINING ROOM,
PLEASE.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.784
- WHERE'S LINZ?

25:51.818 --> 25:53.720
- UH...

25:53.753 --> 25:55.187
SHE WENT TO
THE GROCERY STORE...

25:55.221 --> 25:57.123
WITH GUS.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.825
- WELL, WE WANT
TO SURPRISE HER TOO.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.693
- OH, SHE'LL BE SURPRISED.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.862
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.864
- MM-HMM.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.205
[phone beeps]

26:13.239 --> 26:14.240
[sighs]

26:14.273 --> 26:16.609
- HELLO?
- HEY, IT'S ME.

26:16.643 --> 26:18.077
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?

26:18.110 --> 26:19.078
- YEAH, FUCKING RIGHT
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.346
- THE BABY?

26:20.379 --> 26:21.948
- NO, UH, NO,
IT'S NOT WITH THE BABY.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.349
IT'S JUST--GET YOUR ASS
OVER HERE, QUICK.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.017
- WHY?

26:25.051 --> 26:27.153
- THEY'RE GIVING US
A FUCKING SURPRISE PARTY.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.823
- WELL,
EMMETT'S DONE IT AGAIN.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.959
THIS FOOD IS GREAT.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.994
SHE MUST REALLY BE
STOCKING UP.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.963
- MMM.
- REALLY? FOR ME?

26:36.996 --> 26:40.900
- YOU KNOW,
DOUBLE COUPONS.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.368
- MMM.
- HMM?

26:42.401 --> 26:45.204
- MMM, THAT'S GOOD.
- WOW!

26:47.173 --> 26:49.175
- IS TEDDY GETTING TUBBY?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.777
- HMM, CONSIDERING
THE ADORABLENESS

26:50.810 --> 26:52.044
OF HIS NEW BEAU,

26:52.078 --> 26:53.412
I'D SAY FAT'S THE NEW THIN.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.114
- SO WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
KEEPING YOURSELF?

26:55.147 --> 26:57.016
I'VE BARELY SEEN YOU
SINCE I MOVED BACK.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.786
- ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN OUT
LOOKING FOR A PLACE.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.821
- A PLACE FOR WHAT?

27:01.854 --> 27:05.024
- TO LIVE.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.994
- WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

27:08.027 --> 27:09.428
IT'S NOT
'CAUSE WE WALKED IN

27:09.461 --> 27:11.998
AND FOUND YOU
FUCKING SOME GUY, IS IT?

27:12.031 --> 27:13.666
- WELL...

27:13.700 --> 27:14.901
- THAT WAS JUST A CASE
OF BAD TIMING,

27:14.934 --> 27:16.068
THAT'S ALL.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.403
I MEAN,
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY,

27:17.436 --> 27:19.071
ACTUALLY,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.740
- I'M NOT SURE
THAT CARL FOUND IT

27:20.773 --> 27:22.942
TO BE THE LAUGH RIOT
YOU DID.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.011
- OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT CARL.
HE'LL GET USED TO IT.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.412
- HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.147
THE HOUSE SHOULD BE
THE TWO OF YOURS, DEB,

27:28.180 --> 27:31.951
NOT THE THREE
OF OURS.

27:31.984 --> 27:35.021
- BUT HE'LL NEVER BE BLANCHE
WHEN I'M PLAYING BABY JANE.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.823
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SHOULDERS
OR THE EYEBROWS.

27:36.856 --> 27:39.025
COME ON, YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA TAKE ME

27:39.058 --> 27:40.326
TO SING-A-LONG: WIZARD OF OZ

27:40.359 --> 27:42.161
OR GET DISHY WITH ME
DURING THE AWARDS SHOWS

27:42.194 --> 27:43.763
OR PULL MY FACE BACK
AND TELL ME

27:43.796 --> 27:46.766
HOW MUCH WORK I NEED?

27:46.799 --> 27:49.168
IN OTHER WORDS...

27:49.201 --> 27:50.903
EM...

27:50.937 --> 27:53.072
YOU'RE IRREPLACEABLE.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.111
- WE BOTH HAVE
TO FACE IT, DEB,

27:59.145 --> 28:03.349
LIFE WITH YOUR DETECTIVE
DOES NOT INCLUDE ME.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.189
- WHAT THE HELL TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.390
- HI, MOMMY.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.225
- I HAD TO WAKE UP GUS,
GET HIM DRESSED.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.326
- HERE SHE IS.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.229
- OH, HEY!
all: SURPRISE!

28:17.263 --> 28:18.497
[laughter]

28:18.530 --> 28:20.199
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

28:20.232 --> 28:21.233
OUR FRIENDS THROWING US
A SURPRISE PARTY

28:21.267 --> 28:22.334
FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY?

28:22.368 --> 28:23.870
- WHERE ARE THE GROCERIES?

28:23.903 --> 28:25.237
- THE GROCERIES?

28:25.271 --> 28:26.739
OH, THEY'RE BEING DELIVERED
TOMORROW.

28:26.773 --> 28:27.807
- OH.
- MM.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.742
- DOES EVERYONE
HAVE CHAMPAGNE?

28:29.776 --> 28:31.744
OH, YOU CAN'T TOAST
WITHOUT A GLASS.

28:31.778 --> 28:33.145
- WE KNOW HOW EXHAUSTED
YOU TWO ARE,

28:33.179 --> 28:34.814
BUT WE COULDN'T LET
THIS LANDMARK GO BY

28:34.847 --> 28:36.382
WITHOUT A LITTLE CELEBRATION.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.117
- TEN YEARS IS
QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.485
- I'LL SAY.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.887
- NOW, MORE THAN EVER,
IT'S IMPORTANT

28:40.920 --> 28:42.221
PEOPLE KNOW
THAT A GAY COUPLE CAN BE

28:42.254 --> 28:44.090
JUST AS COMMITTED
AS ANY STRAIGHT COUPLE.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.157
- TO MEL AND LINZ.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.826
all: TO MEL AND LINZ.

28:46.859 --> 28:47.994
- A SPEECH
FROM THE OLD MARRIED COUPLE.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.962
COME ON.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.297
- THERE IS SOMETHING
WE'D LIKE TO SAY.

28:51.330 --> 28:54.100
- NO, THERE ISN'T.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.501
NOW IS NOT
THE RIGHT TIME.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.370
- WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME?

28:58.404 --> 29:00.339
- RIGHT TIME FOR WHAT?

29:02.909 --> 29:04.043
- I THINK YOU ALL
SHOULD KNOW...

29:04.076 --> 29:05.177
- HOW MUCH WE
APPRECIATE THIS.

29:05.211 --> 29:08.981
- WOULD YOU STOP?

29:09.015 --> 29:13.052
WE CAN'T HIDE IT ANYMORE.
IT ISN'T FAIR.

29:16.555 --> 29:20.192
THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOUR GOOD WISHES.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.995
BUT YOU SEE, MELANIE AND I
ARE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.864
- I WASN'T HAVING
ANY PROBLEMS.

29:24.897 --> 29:26.265
I-I WAS TRYING TO HAVE A BABY.
- ALL RIGHT, I'M THE ONE.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.867
I'M THE ONE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ALL THE PROBLEMS.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.268
- DAMN RIGHT YOU ARE!

29:29.301 --> 29:31.203
- FOR WHICH
I HAVE APOLOGIZED ENDLESSLY.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.571
BUT YOU STILL REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THE FACT--

29:32.604 --> 29:33.873
- THAT FUCKING SAM AUERBACH

29:33.906 --> 29:35.875
HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH SEX?

29:35.908 --> 29:37.176
IT WAS ALL ABOUT ART.

29:37.209 --> 29:40.947
ALL THE HUMPING WAS
ABOUT FORM AND FUNCTION?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.481
[scoffs]

29:46.986 --> 29:48.888
- THE TRUTH IS
WE HAVEN'T BEEN LIVING TOGETHER

29:48.921 --> 29:51.824
SINCE OUR DAUGHTER
WAS BORN.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.903
[dance music]

30:03.936 --> 30:07.339
[indistinct chatter]

30:12.879 --> 30:15.814
- [panting]

30:25.992 --> 30:27.059
- WHO TURNED ON
THE LIGHTS?

30:27.093 --> 30:28.127
- WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?

30:28.160 --> 30:29.461
- TURN THEM OFF.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.197
- TURN THE FUCKING LIGHTS
BACK OFF.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.498
- JESUS CHRIST.
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.867
- GENTLEMEN!
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?

30:34.901 --> 30:36.068
- AW, MAN.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.336
- THIS CLUB IS
OFFICIALLY CLOSED.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.138
SO PULL UP YOUR PANTS,
AND GO HOME.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.873
- LET'S GO.
COME ON. COME ON.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.274
- THAT'S MY SHIRT.
- LET'S GO, EVERYBODY.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.609
PARTY'S OVER.
LET'S GO.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.211
- THAT INCLUDES YOU.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.079
- JUST WAIT A SEC.
[panting]

30:47.113 --> 30:49.381
- DON'T GIVE ME
ANY OF YOUR LIP.

30:49.415 --> 30:50.382
- GRAB MY SHIRT.
JUST GRAB THE T-SHIRT.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.383
- LET'S GO.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.385
- [moans]

31:00.993 --> 31:02.428
THANKS, OFFICER.

31:02.461 --> 31:04.964
I'LL DO THE SAME FOR YOU
ONE DAY.

31:04.997 --> 31:08.434
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:12.671 --> 31:15.908
- I COME HERE EVERY DAY
TO BE WITH THE BABY.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.977
- SO I CAN BE WITH GUS.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.379
- THEN GUS AND I GO BACK
TO THE APARTMENT.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.648
- YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT?

31:22.681 --> 31:24.550
- YEAH. A SMALL ONE-BEDROOM
I'VE BEEN RENTING.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.585
- WE'VE BEEN RENTING,

31:26.618 --> 31:28.520
ALTHOUGH WE CAN BARELY AFFORD
THIS PLACE.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.189
- WELL, GUS AND I
HAVE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE,

31:30.222 --> 31:31.523
OR WOULD YOU RATHER
WE SLEEP ON THE STREET?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.025
- DID I SAY THAT?

31:33.059 --> 31:34.393
- WE'RE JUST A LITTLE THROWN.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.595
YOU GOT TO ADMIT,
IT'S A SHOCK.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.297
- I WANTED IT
ALL OUT IN THE OPEN.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.532
- WELL, I DIDN'T.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.334
I'M THE ONE
WHO HAD THE BABY.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.669
I HAD ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH,

31:43.702 --> 31:46.005
WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN
TO EVERYONE.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.673
- LOOK, YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
PERSONAL PROBLEMS,

31:47.706 --> 31:49.008
WE UNDERSTAND.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.343
- NO, WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.446
HOW YOU COULD NOT SAY
A WORD ALL THIS TIME?

31:54.480 --> 31:55.948
SO WHEN WERE YOU
GOING TO TELL ME,

31:55.982 --> 31:57.449
AFTER SHE GREW UP
AND WENT TO COLLEGE

31:57.483 --> 31:59.418
AND GOT MARRIED
AND HAD CHILDREN OF HER OWN?

31:59.451 --> 32:01.620
I HAVE SEEN YOU PRACTICALLY
EVERY DAY

32:01.653 --> 32:04.556
SINCE JENNY WAS BORN,
AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SO SWEET,

32:04.590 --> 32:06.358
SO ADORABLE,
THE TWO DOTING MOTHERS.

32:06.392 --> 32:09.928
WELL, WHO WOULD'VE GUESSED
IT WAS A BIG FUCKING LIE?

32:11.530 --> 32:14.166
- WE MADE A WRONG DECISION
BY NOT TELLING YOU...

32:14.200 --> 32:18.204
FOR WHICH
WE ARE TRULY SORRY.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.039
BUT WE'VE BEEN
UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.174
- AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH.

32:22.208 --> 32:25.344
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW DECEIT
CAN RAISE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.316
- WHEN I AGREED TO BE
THE BABY'S FATHER,

32:30.349 --> 32:32.184
IT WAS BECAUSE I KNEW
SHE WOULD BE RAISED

32:32.218 --> 32:34.720
IN A LOVING HOME,
WITH TWO LOVING PARENTS,

32:34.753 --> 32:36.755
NOT IN SOME SORT
OF TIME-SHARING ARRANGEMENT

32:36.788 --> 32:38.590
WITH COMPLIMENTARY SNIPING.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.327
NOW, YOU CAN MAKE
ALL THE EXCUSES YOU WANT,

32:41.360 --> 32:43.129
BUT IF THIS IS HOW YOU
PLAN ON RAISING OUR DAUGHTER,

32:43.162 --> 32:46.498
THEN WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE
HAD HER IN THE FIRST PLACE.

32:55.241 --> 32:58.244
[door opens, slams]

33:00.246 --> 33:02.248
[TV chatter]

33:02.281 --> 33:03.615
- [chuckles]

33:03.649 --> 33:07.253
GOD, I LOVE THIS PART.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.388
- FRANKLY,
I'VE NEVER BEEN TOO KEEN

33:09.421 --> 33:11.290
ABOUT THE GRUMPY OLD MEN
MOVIES.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.226
- I LOVE THE CLASSICS.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.163
- [chuckles]
CLASSICS.

33:18.264 --> 33:19.565
- HERE, HAVE ANOTHER.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.633
- NO, NO, NO. I COULDN'T.
- COME ON.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.502
- NO, SIX IS
MY ABSOLUTE LIMIT.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.238
- COME ON.
- NO. NO!

33:26.272 --> 33:27.306
[growls]

33:27.339 --> 33:29.675
- [laughs]

33:32.411 --> 33:34.246
YOU KNOW, AT THIS RATE,

33:34.280 --> 33:37.183
I'M GONNA TURN
INTO THAT GUY I SAW ON TV

33:37.216 --> 33:38.584
WHO WAS SO FAT,
THEY HAD TO REMOVE A WALL

33:38.617 --> 33:40.386
TO GET HIM
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.121
- FINE BY ME.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.690
- [chuckles]

33:44.723 --> 33:46.658
- THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT THE SCENT

33:46.692 --> 33:48.260
OF AN OLD GUY...

33:48.294 --> 33:49.595
- AH!

33:49.628 --> 33:52.331
[laughs]

33:52.364 --> 33:56.135
- MAKES ME SO HOT.
- OH.

33:56.168 --> 34:01.573
- THE LOVELY GRAY FLECKS
TURNING INTO WHITE.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.176
THE BABY-BOTTOM PINK SCALP

34:04.210 --> 34:07.813
PEEKING THROUGH THE LITTLE HAIRS
ON TOP...

34:07.846 --> 34:13.219
LIKE WILD GRASS
ON THE BEACH.

34:13.252 --> 34:16.155
AND TO GRAB ON
TO THOSE LOVE HANDLES

34:16.188 --> 34:20.626
WHILE I'M SHOOTING
ALL OVER THAT BIG, FULL BELLY.

34:26.132 --> 34:29.435
COME ON, LOVER...

34:29.468 --> 34:31.403
EAT.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.213
- [chuckles nervously]

34:44.650 --> 34:46.185
- [clears throat]

34:46.218 --> 34:47.319
- SHAWN, HONEY,

34:47.353 --> 34:49.221
I TOLD YOU TO STAY
IN MY ROOM.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.323
- I'M NOT "SHAWN, HONEY."

34:51.357 --> 34:52.858
- NO.
[chuckles]

34:52.891 --> 34:55.461
CLEARLY.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.129
- HAND ME
THE CRANBERRY JUICE.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.097
- YEAH, YEAH.

35:01.800 --> 35:05.204
- [clears throat]

35:05.237 --> 35:06.605
I'VE BEEN MEANING
FOR US TO HAVE A...

35:06.638 --> 35:09.741
[clears throat]
POW-WOW.

35:09.775 --> 35:12.878
ALTHOUGH I NEVER
IMAGINED IT TO BE...

35:12.911 --> 35:15.147
- AU NATUREL?

35:15.181 --> 35:16.882
WELL, YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.151
MY LUST BUNNY
IS LOCKED AWAY IN MY ROOM.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.886
I EVEN PUT A GAG
IN HIS MOUTH.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.488
OF COURSE,
IT WAS LEATHER,

35:22.521 --> 35:25.791
AND HE BEGGED ME
TO DO IT.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.895
ANYWAYS,
STARTING SUNDAY,

35:29.928 --> 35:33.832
YOU AND DEB WILL HAVE
THIS PLACE ALL TO YOURSELVES.

35:33.865 --> 35:36.835
UM, UH,
BUFFALO WINGS?

35:39.338 --> 35:42.441
- DEB IS VERY UPSET
YOU'RE LEAVING.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.675
- UP TO YOU NOW
TO STOP HER

35:43.709 --> 35:47.246
FROM BUYING
EVERYTHING ON QVC.

35:47.279 --> 35:50.649
- TRUTH IS, I'M A LITTLE SORRY
TO SEE YOU GO MYSELF.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.551
- YOU ARE?

35:52.584 --> 35:54.253
- IS THAT SUCH A SURPRISE?

35:54.286 --> 35:56.655
- FRANKLY, YES.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.590
MOST STRAIGHT MEN
TAKE ONE LOOK AT ME

35:58.624 --> 36:00.592
AND HEAD FOR THE HILLS.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.394
EXCEPT FOR MY FATHER.

36:02.428 --> 36:05.931
HE RAN ME OUT ON A RAIL.

36:05.964 --> 36:11.437
- WELL, THAT'S HIS LOSS.
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

36:11.470 --> 36:15.341
IN FACT, CONSIDERING
THE NUMBER OF HOURS I WORK,

36:15.374 --> 36:18.710
SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT...

36:18.744 --> 36:20.412
I'D BE A HELL
OF A LOT HAPPIER

36:20.446 --> 36:23.349
IF I KNEW DEB WASN'T
IN THE HOUSE ALONE.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.484
- CARL HORVATH,

36:25.517 --> 36:27.286
ARE YOU ASKING ME TO STAY?

36:27.319 --> 36:29.421
- [chuckles]

36:29.455 --> 36:33.359
DOESN'T TAKE A DETECTIVE
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

36:33.392 --> 36:37.563
BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.

36:37.596 --> 36:41.300
- WHAT ABOUT MY SEX--
MY LOVE LIFE?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.769
- I BOUGHT A SOUND MACHINE.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.572
ALL I HEAR NOW IS
RAINDROPS FALLING,

36:46.605 --> 36:48.707
RIVERS FLOWING,
BIRDS CHIRPING.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.242
- MAYBE I SHOULD
GET ONE OF THOSE.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.843
PRETEND I'M FUCKING
IN A RAIN FOREST.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.313
- [laughs]

36:54.346 --> 36:56.382
- OH, I'D BETTER
GET BACK TO...

36:56.415 --> 36:58.350
- SHAWN, HONEY.

37:00.386 --> 37:03.389
- YOU KNOW, IF, UM,
IF YOU WERE GAY,

37:03.422 --> 37:06.758
YOU'D MAKE
ONE HELL OF A BEAR.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.602
- I TOLD MELANIE.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.036
SHE WAS SITTING
RIGHT OVER THERE.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.338
I SAID, "IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT'S GOING ON

37:19.371 --> 37:20.672
"BETWEEN YOU AND LINDSAY,

37:20.706 --> 37:22.007
YOUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY
IS THAT BABY."

37:22.040 --> 37:24.376
- DEB, COULD I GET
A PIECE OF THE KEY LIME?

37:24.410 --> 37:25.377
- WHEN YOU FINISH
YOUR MEAT LOAF.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.378
BUT DID THEY LISTEN?

37:26.412 --> 37:27.746
- OBVIOUSLY NOT.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.348
- INSTEAD THEY GO AND DESTROY
A FAMILY.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.750
THEY TURNED A HAPPY HOME
INTO A BROKEN ONE.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.352
- WITHOUT EVEN TELLING US.

37:33.385 --> 37:35.354
[bell rings]
- COFFEE TO GO, DEB.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.822
- YOU WANT ANYTHING
WITH IT?

37:36.855 --> 37:38.290
- HOW COULD YOU EAT
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

37:38.324 --> 37:39.558
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.659
STEAM'S STILL COMING
OUT OF MY EARS.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.495
- HEY, DEB.
[bell rings]

37:43.529 --> 37:45.664
- IF I HEAR THAT FUCKING THING
ONE MORE TIME,

37:45.697 --> 37:47.666
YOU'RE GONNA
BE HEARING BELLS.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.834
- MY HEART'S BROKEN.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.502
MY SOUL, CRUSHED.

37:50.536 --> 37:51.503
- HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

37:51.537 --> 37:52.971
- THE INSENSITIVITY.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.773
YOU KNOW, IT'S IMMORAL,
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

37:54.806 --> 37:55.841
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.709
- HOW COULD THEY DO THIS?

37:57.743 --> 38:00.512
- YOU WERE RIGHT.
NEVER TRUST MUNCHERS.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.647
- MUNCHERS?

38:01.680 --> 38:03.515
- MEL AND LINZ.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.650
- WHAT THE HELL HAVE THEY GOT
TO DO WITH IT?

38:04.683 --> 38:05.784
- WHO DO YOU THINK
IS RESPONSIBLE?

38:05.817 --> 38:08.420
- FOR CLOSING BABYLON?

38:09.855 --> 38:12.458
- IS THAT ALL
YOU CARE ABOUT?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.693
WHO GIVES A SHIT IF THE COPS
CLOSED DOWN BABYLON?

38:14.726 --> 38:17.396
- I, FOR ONE,
GIVE A VERY BIG SHIT

38:17.429 --> 38:18.864
THAT THAT CUM STAIN,
SAPPERSTEIN,

38:18.897 --> 38:20.699
WAS DEFRAUDING
THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

38:20.732 --> 38:22.434
BY HIDING THOUSANDS,

38:22.468 --> 38:24.470
PERHAPS EVEN HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

38:24.503 --> 38:25.937
UP IN HIS OFFICE
IN PILLOW CASES,

38:25.971 --> 38:27.839
WHICH, KNOWING HIM,
YOU CAN BE SURE

38:27.873 --> 38:30.442
WERE NOT
THE HIGHEST THREAD COUNT.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.977
- AND NOW, BECAUSE
OF HIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES,

38:32.010 --> 38:34.446
BABYLON IS GONE.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.482
KAPUT. FINITO.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.484
- AND THAT CONCERNS YOU
MORE THAN THE FACT

38:38.517 --> 38:40.018
THAT MEL AND LINZ
WERE LYING TO US?

38:40.051 --> 38:41.853
THAT NOW MY DAUGHTER
AND YOUR SON

38:41.887 --> 38:43.489
ARE THE PRODUCTS
OF A BROKEN HOME?

38:43.522 --> 38:46.558
- CHRIST,
THE THREE OF YOU.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.728
NEVER SAW
SUCH DRAMA QUEENS.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.697
FIRST, LINDSAY WAS WAILING
TO ME ON THE PHONE

38:51.730 --> 38:52.964
THE NIGHT
SHE AND MELANIE SPLIT,

38:52.998 --> 38:54.966
NOW YOU.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.502
ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS,

38:56.535 --> 38:57.503
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

38:57.536 --> 39:00.606
- SHE ASKED ME NOT TO.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.774
- SO YOUR LOYALTY TO HER

39:02.808 --> 39:04.710
WAS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN OUR FRIENDSHIP?

39:04.743 --> 39:07.513
- DON'T MAKE THIS ABOUT US,
MICHAEL.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.881
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

39:11.817 --> 39:15.020
THE EVER CHANGING
KALEIDOSCOPE OF LIFE.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.725
- J.T. FLOATS,

39:19.758 --> 39:21.793
LOST AMONG THE STARS,

39:21.827 --> 39:26.498
WONDERING IF HE'LL EVER
SEE RAGE AGAIN.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.906
- THANK YOU.

39:34.940 --> 39:40.912
[indistinct chatter]

39:43.682 --> 39:45.083
[tapping buttons]

39:45.116 --> 39:47.753
- I PROMISED
I'D COME FOR YOU, J.T.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.888
EVEN IF I HAD TO GO
TO THE END OF THE UNIVERSE.

39:49.921 --> 39:52.157
I JUST DID A TEST
IN FRONT OF THE GREEN SCREEN.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.626
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

39:54.660 --> 39:57.095
- IT'S HOT.
- YEAH, AND ITCHY.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.897
CHECK OUT THIS PACKAGE.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.833
- THAT'S GONNA WIN
AN OSCAR FOR SPECIAL EFFECTS.

40:01.867 --> 40:04.636
- DIDN'T HEAR YOU COMPLAINING.
- [grunts]

40:04.670 --> 40:07.539
- OKAY, SUPERHERO,
TURN IN YOUR TIGHTS.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.040
FENDERMAN JUST
PULLED THE PLUG.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.510
- WHAT?
- HE CAN'T DO THAT.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.511
- HE CAN, AND HE DID.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.945
HE JUST REAMED MY ASS,

40:13.979 --> 40:16.782
AND NOT LIKE IN SCENE 32
WHERE RAGE GIVES J.T.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.450
THE RIMMING
OF A LIFETIME.

40:18.484 --> 40:20.652
THE PICTURE'S OVER BUDGET,
OVER SCHEDULE.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.053
- YOU SAID THEY SAY THAT
ABOUT EVERY PICTURE.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.122
- THEY DO.
- THEN WHAT'S THE REAL REASON?

40:24.155 --> 40:25.591
- HE'S AFRAID,

40:25.624 --> 40:27.659
OF THE TIMES,
THE POLITICAL CLIMATE.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.094
- WELL, HE'S WRONG.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.796
TELL HIM THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF QUEERS OUT THERE,

40:30.829 --> 40:32.931
WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
- I DID.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.667
HE'S MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
ALIENATING THE FAMILY AUDIENCE,

40:35.701 --> 40:37.536
PISSING OFF
THE PARENT CORPORATION,

40:37.569 --> 40:39.871
DISPLEASING SOMEONE
IN WASHINGTON

40:39.905 --> 40:42.207
WHO CAN MAKE THAT TAX BREAK
VERY HARD TO COME BY.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.809
- WHAT, SO IT'S OVER?

40:43.842 --> 40:45.544
JUST LIKE THAT?

40:45.577 --> 40:49.080
- HE'S GREEN-LIGHTING
THE PASSION OF MOSES.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.618
GAY'S OUT.
GOD'S IN.

41:04.029 --> 41:07.533
- OH, OOH, OOH, OOH.
[door closes]

41:09.535 --> 41:10.969
- MM, HEY.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.237
[Gus sneezes]

41:12.270 --> 41:14.573
- OH, SWEETIE,
DO YOU HAVE A COLD?

41:14.606 --> 41:16.508
- YEAH, I THINK
HE CAUGHT ONE LAST NIGHT.

41:16.542 --> 41:17.976
- I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED,

41:18.009 --> 41:19.711
DRAGGING HIM OVER HERE,
SO WE COULD PLAY

41:19.745 --> 41:20.979
"ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY."

41:21.012 --> 41:22.981
- I DIDN'T DRAG HIM.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.282
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CALLED,

41:24.315 --> 41:26.918
WHO INSISTED WE KEEP UP
THIS RIDICULOUS CHARADE.

41:26.952 --> 41:28.754
- AND YOU SAW WHY I DID,
DIDN'T YOU?

41:28.787 --> 41:29.755
NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ALL THEIR SHIT

41:29.788 --> 41:32.257
AS WELL AS OUR OWN.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.892
OH, SPEAKING OF SHIT...

41:33.925 --> 41:35.761
DID YOU BRING
HIS MEDICATION?

41:35.794 --> 41:37.996
- "DELICIOUS CHERRY FLAVOR
YOUR KIDS'LL LOVE"?

41:38.029 --> 41:40.131
HE HATES IT.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.166
HERE, WHY DON'T
YOU LET ME...

41:41.199 --> 41:42.601
- CHRIST, I CAN DO IT!

41:42.634 --> 41:44.069
WOULD YOU JUST GO TO WORK
ALREADY?

41:44.102 --> 41:46.171
GOD.

41:48.807 --> 41:51.076
- IT HAD TO BE DONE.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.078
WE HAD TO TELL THEM.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.787
- IT'S JUST THAT...

42:01.820 --> 42:05.056
- WHAT?

42:05.090 --> 42:08.293
- TELLING THEM...

42:08.326 --> 42:10.762
SEEING THEIR FACES...

42:10.796 --> 42:11.897
KNOWING THEY KNOW...

42:11.930 --> 42:13.932
[Jenny fusses]

42:18.870 --> 42:21.573
SOMEHOW MAKES IT REAL.

42:26.344 --> 42:30.215
[Jenny crying]

42:34.352 --> 42:37.188
[door opens]

42:37.222 --> 42:38.657
[door closes]

42:38.690 --> 42:40.992
[Jenny fussing]

42:41.026 --> 42:42.093
- YEAH?

42:42.127 --> 42:44.863
- [babbles]

42:44.896 --> 42:46.197
- WE'RE HAVING
SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS

42:46.231 --> 42:47.866
OVER SUNDAY FOR A BARBECUE.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.200
- I'VE ASKED
A COUPLE OF MEMBERS

42:49.234 --> 42:50.836
OF OUR ILLUSTRIOUS
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT,

42:50.869 --> 42:52.070
KELLEY, BRAVERMAN.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.338
- WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
COME TOO?

42:53.371 --> 42:54.840
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

42:54.873 --> 42:57.676
- AND BE SURE
TO BRING HUNTER.

42:57.709 --> 42:59.678
- HI.
- HEY.

42:59.711 --> 43:01.947
- OH, HOW'S IT GOING?

43:01.980 --> 43:03.148
- THEY JUST MOVED IN
ACROSS THE STREET.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.816
THEY'VE GOT TWINS.

43:04.850 --> 43:07.886
- SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY
AROUND HERE'S GOT KIDS.

43:07.919 --> 43:09.888
- WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE YOU'LL BE OUT STROLLING

43:09.921 --> 43:12.724
WITH YOUR OWN BAMBINO TOO.

43:12.758 --> 43:14.225
- THIS ONE JUST WENT
ON THE MARKET.

43:14.259 --> 43:16.628
- NICE YARD,
BUT IT COULD USE A MAKEOVER.

43:16.662 --> 43:18.229
- COULDN'T WE ALL?

43:18.263 --> 43:19.998
I WONDER
WHAT THEY'RE ASKING.

43:20.031 --> 43:22.701
- IN THAT CONDITION,
IT'S PROBABLY A BARGAIN.

43:22.734 --> 43:25.971
SURE YOU GUYS
AREN'T INTERESTED?

43:26.004 --> 43:28.173
- OH, WE--
WE'VE TALKED IT OVER,

43:28.206 --> 43:31.109
AND WE'VE DECIDED
TO STAY PUT FOR NOW.

43:31.142 --> 43:34.880
- HOW SOON
COULD WE SEE IT?

43:34.913 --> 43:36.147
LIKE YOU SAID,
WE'RE ON TOP

43:36.181 --> 43:37.315
OF EACH OTHER
IN THE APARTMENT.

43:37.348 --> 43:38.984
HUNTER NEEDS
HIS OWN SPACE.

43:39.017 --> 43:40.385
JENNY REBECCA'S GONNA
NEED HER OWN ROOM,

43:40.418 --> 43:42.387
A YARD TO PLAY IN.

43:42.420 --> 43:44.189
- WE'LL WRITE DOWN
THE REALTOR'S NUMBER,

43:44.222 --> 43:47.993
AND YOU CAN GIVE HIM
A CALL.

43:48.026 --> 43:52.731
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO STAY ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

43:52.764 --> 43:55.300
- MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR A CHANGE.

44:02.974 --> 44:05.210
[door opens]

44:05.243 --> 44:07.178
- BRIAN?

44:09.981 --> 44:11.149
SO WHY THE URGENT MESSAGE?

44:11.182 --> 44:14.319
"MEET ME AT BABYLON.
NOW."

44:14.352 --> 44:17.022
- I FOUND
THAT LITTLE SOMETHING

44:17.055 --> 44:19.090
YOU TOLD ME
TO TREAT MYSELF TO.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.225
- WHAT?

44:20.258 --> 44:21.326
- YOU'RE STANDING IN IT.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.328
[liquid pours]

44:26.331 --> 44:28.967
- BABYLON?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.970
I SAID THE TOY,
NOT THE PLAYROOM.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.171
- I WANT IT.

44:33.204 --> 44:35.373
- OH, "YOU WANT IT."
WHAT FOR?

44:35.406 --> 44:37.976
- WELL, I GOTTA KEEP THE BOYS
OFF THE STREET AT NIGHT.

44:38.009 --> 44:39.210
I'VE GOT TO PROVIDE THEM

44:39.244 --> 44:40.378
WITH A WARM,
FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT

44:40.411 --> 44:42.047
IN WHICH TO USE
ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES

44:42.080 --> 44:43.381
AND HAVE PROMISCUOUS SEX.

44:43.414 --> 44:44.449
SAFELY, OF COURSE.

44:44.482 --> 44:45.984
- A NOBLE SENTIMENT.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.819
BUT INVESTMENT-WISE,
NOT VERY PRACTICAL.

44:47.853 --> 44:50.822
- AND WHAT WOULD BE PRACTICAL,
THEODORE?

44:50.856 --> 44:52.390
TO GET MARRIED?

44:52.423 --> 44:54.459
AND MOVE TO THE SUBURBS?
- [sighs]

44:54.492 --> 44:56.194
- AND BECOME A HOME-LOVING,

44:56.227 --> 45:00.331
CHILD-RAISING, GOD-FEARING
IMITATION HETEROSEXUAL?

45:00.365 --> 45:02.067
[scoffs]

45:02.100 --> 45:04.469
AND FOR WHAT?

45:04.502 --> 45:06.137
SO THAT I CAN BECOME
ANOTHER DEAD SOUL,

45:06.171 --> 45:07.372
GOING TO THE MALL

45:07.405 --> 45:08.940
AND DROPPING MY KIDS
OFF AT SCHOOL

45:08.974 --> 45:11.342
AND HAVING BARBECUES
IN THE BACKYARD?

45:11.376 --> 45:13.311
[scoffs]

45:16.982 --> 45:20.852
THAT'S THEIR DEATH.

45:20.886 --> 45:22.854
NOT MINE.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.996
I'M A COCKSUCKER!

45:31.029 --> 45:33.899
I'M QUEER!

45:33.932 --> 45:37.869
AND TO ANYONE
WHO TAKES PITY OR OFFENSE...

45:39.437 --> 45:43.441
I SAY, "JUDGE YOURSELF."

45:46.077 --> 45:50.248
THIS IS WHERE I LIVE.

45:50.281 --> 45:53.518
THIS IS WHO I AM.

45:53.551 --> 45:56.021
[dramatic music]

45:56.054 --> 45:57.989
- AND AS RAGE STANDS

45:58.023 --> 46:00.558
AT THE PRECIPICE
OF A NEW WORLD...

46:00.591 --> 46:08.066
*

46:10.035 --> 46:13.004
- * SEE THE NEW HORIZON

46:13.038 --> 46:17.275

46:17.308 --> 46:20.345
* SEE A NEW MOON RISING

46:20.378 --> 46:24.149
* ACROSS THE SKY
BEFORE THE DAWN *

46:24.182 --> 46:32.157
*

46:32.190 --> 46:36.194
* IT MAY SEEM
THAT YOU WON'T MAKE IT *

46:36.227 --> 46:39.297
* AND EVERYTHING GOES WRONG

46:39.330 --> 46:43.501
* BUT YOU KNOW
THAT LOVE CAN KEEP YOU *

46:43.534 --> 46:47.372
* WHEN ALL YOUR HOPE IS GONE

46:47.405 --> 46:50.475

46:50.508 --> 46:54.980
* AND THE PAST

46:55.013 --> 46:58.083
* SEE A NEW MOON RISING

46:58.116 --> 47:03.088
* ACROSS THE SKY
BEFORE THE DAWN *

47:03.121 --> 47:10.828
*

47:17.235 --> 47:21.406
* NOW I KNOW THE DARKEST HOUR

47:21.439 --> 47:24.609
* SWEAR THE CHANGE WILL COME

47:24.642 --> 47:29.080
* THAT'S WHEN I FEEL
I'VE GOT THE POWER *

47:29.114 --> 47:32.617
* GROWING LIKE THE SUN

47:32.650 --> 47:36.087
