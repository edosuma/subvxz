08:47.396 --> 08:49.964
JORDAN: MONEY.
COACH GARRETT:
CONTAIN, CONTAIN, CONTAIN.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
AS SOON AS THAT BALL
IS IN THE AIR,

08:51.618 --> 08:54.011
YOU GOTTA BE FINDING
SOMEONE TO HIT!

08:54.055 --> 08:55.186

09:00.670 --> 09:02.585

TOUGHER ON THEM.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.934
IT'S CRAZY HOW
ROWE AND CARROLL

09:03.978 --> 09:05.762
WAS TOP IN THEIR CLASS

09:05.806 --> 09:08.591
AND NOW THEY ON
SPECIAL TEAMS.

09:08.635 --> 09:09.636
LAST THING I'M
TRYING TO DO IS

STUDYING PLAYS,

09:28.089 --> 09:29.699
BALLIN' OUT AT PRACTICE.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.440
AT THIS POINT,
WHAT ELSE CAN I DO, MAN?

09:32.702 --> 09:33.790
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO

09:33.834 --> 09:35.531
MOVE AWAY FROM
THE PLAYBOOK.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.620

SWITCH THINGS UP.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.101
KIND OF LIKE HOW YOGA
HELPS YOU FIND BALANCE.

KEEPING THAT SAME ENERGY

09:41.711 --> 09:45.236

INTRO TO FILM STUDIES?

09:53.331 --> 09:55.769
OH. IT'S A TOTAL
MISUNDERSTANDING.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.510
I WAS GONNA EMAIL MY
PROFESSOR AND CLEAR IT UP.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.512
HE THINKS I
PLAGIARIZED A PAPER.

10:00.556 --> 10:01.644
WHOSE PAPER?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.690
MINE, FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

10:03.733 --> 10:05.866
WHICH I TOLD HIM,
BY THE WAY.

ON THE ROCK?

10:07.694 --> 10:10.653
NO, NO, NO, NO.
HOW MUCH OF THAT PAPER
DID YOU USE?

10:10.697 --> 10:14.657

LIKE, MAYBE 70%.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.834
OOH, TOPS.
BESIDES, IT'S MINE.

10:17.878 --> 10:20.358

PLAGIARISM, THOUGH.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.535

THAT I REALLY FELT ALIVE.

17:15.598 --> 17:18.253
WHENEVER MY FEET
TOUCHED THE GRASS,

17:18.298 --> 17:19.167
IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.258
I DON'T KNOW HOW BEST
TO DESCRIBE IT.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.871
I JUST KNOW THAT
NOTHING HAD EVER

17:26.915 --> 17:28.569
MADE ME FEEL
LIKE THAT BEFORE.

17:29.961 --> 17:32.051
THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME
WHEN I WAS 8.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.751
THE ESSAY PROMPT SEEMS
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.231
WHAT'S A STORY OF
ADVERSITY YOU FACED

17:38.274 --> 17:39.971
AS IT RELATES TO
ONE OF YOUR
FAVORITE FILMS?

17:40.015 --> 17:41.582
I ACTUALLY THINK

17:41.625 --> 17:44.976
I MIGHT HAVE A NEW SPIN.
CAN I RUN IT BY YOU?

17:45.020 --> 17:46.717
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
PAYING ME FOR. SHOOT.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.155
OK. SO,
I WAS THINKING

17:49.198 --> 17:50.982
I COULD WRITE ABOUT
THIS RIFT

17:51.026 --> 17:52.506
MY BEST FRIEND JORDAN
AND I HAD IN HIGH SCHOOL

17:52.549 --> 17:54.682
WHEN WE WERE COMPETING
FOR THE QB1 SPOT.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.250
THE TITLE COULD BE
SOMETHING LIKE

17:57.293 --> 18:01.036
"ARE WE BROS, NO MO'?

18:01.080 --> 18:05.780
A TALE OF BROS
AND FAST FIVE."

18:05.823 --> 18:07.129
VIN DIESEL'S FAST FIVE?

18:07.173 --> 18:08.130
YES, WHEN HOBBS
WAS INTRODUCED.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.219
A.K.A. MY BOY THE ROCK.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.265
MAN, I DON'T KNOW I DIDN'T
PUT THIS TOGETHER BEFORE,

18:12.308 --> 18:15.224
BUT DOM AND HOBBS
STARTED OFF AS ENEMIES,

18:15.268 --> 18:18.184
ONLY TO REALIZE
THEY WERE MORE POWERFUL

18:18.227 --> 18:19.098
AS ALLIES.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.798
BRO, THAT WAS LITERALLY
ME AND JORDAN.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.409
I MEAN, IN OUR CASE,
IT WAS KIND OF FRIENDS

18:26.453 --> 18:28.759
TO FRENEMIES
TO FRIENDS AGAIN, BUT

18:28.803 --> 18:31.327
THE METAPHOR
PAINTS ITSELF.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.155
WHY DON'T I TAKE
THIS ALL IN,

18:33.199 --> 18:34.852
TAKE A CRACK
AT THE OUTLINE,

18:34.896 --> 18:36.332
AND I'LL GET
BACK TO YOU?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.160
SOUNDS SOLID, BRO.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.602
GRACE: I FEEL BAD
ABOUT SETTING UP
THAT MEETING.

18:45.646 --> 18:46.864
I HAD NO IDEA
SHE WAS GONNA

18:46.908 --> 18:48.301
AMBUSH YOU LIKE THAT.

18:49.432 --> 18:51.260
I MEAN, I GET THAT
SHE'S UPSET

18:51.304 --> 18:53.523
BECAUSE IT'S HER SON,
BUT SHE DOES UNDERSTAND

18:53.567 --> 18:55.612
THAT I'M HERE TRYING
TO HELP, RIGHT?

18:57.614 --> 19:00.835
OK. THERE'S A VERY
FINE LINE

19:00.878 --> 19:04.186
BETWEEN "ALLY"
KIND OF HELP

19:04.230 --> 19:05.318
AND "SAVIOR"
KIND OF HELP.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.015
WAIT. YOU AGREE
WITH HER?

19:07.058 --> 19:09.583
I'M THE POSTER CHILD FOR
WHITE SAVIOR SYNDROME?

19:09.626 --> 19:11.541
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I SAID, LAURA.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.457
MY POINT IS,
IT IS A FINE LINE

19:14.501 --> 19:16.242
AND BECAUSE SAFRON
DOESN'T REALLY

19:16.285 --> 19:18.244
KNOW YOU PERSONALLY,
IT'S EASY TO SEE

19:18.287 --> 19:20.202
HOW FROM HER PERSPECTIVE
YOU JUST COMING IN

19:20.246 --> 19:21.421
TRYING TO SAVE
A COMMUNITY

19:21.464 --> 19:22.683
THAT DOESN'T NEED
TO BE SAVED.

19:22.726 --> 19:23.858
IT NEEDS RESOURCES.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.207
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.688
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
BE TRYING TO HELP.

19:27.731 --> 19:28.689
NOT LIKE THIS.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.386
OK, EASY.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.214
NOBODY SAID THAT, EITHER.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.782
YOU ARE A PART OF
THIS COMMUNITY NOW, LAURA.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.218
YOU AND BILLY
LIVE HERE.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.264
IT'S A PART OF
WHO YOUR KIDS ARE.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.702
JUST GIVE EVERYBODY
A LITTLE MORE TIME

19:41.745 --> 19:43.312
TO GET TO KNOW
THE REAL YOU.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.793
NOT THE D.A. THEY SEE
ON THEIR TV SCREENS.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.883
THEN WE CAN ALL COME
TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY,

19:48.926 --> 19:51.799
THEN LISTEN TO WHAT
WE ALL REALLY NEED

19:51.842 --> 19:53.975
AND SEE HOW WE CAN
BECOME THAT RESOURCE.

19:57.674 --> 20:00.286
MICKEY: I OPENED THIS GYM
ALMOST 5 YEARS AGO

20:00.329 --> 20:03.245
WITH SOME SMALL SAVINGS
AND A DREAM.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.292
THE FIRST FEW YEARS, WE COULDN'T
GET OVER 100 CLIENTS

20:06.335 --> 20:08.337
AND I WAS ON THE VERGE
OF SHUTTING DOWN.

20:08.381 --> 20:09.686
MATERIALIZING OUR DREAM...

20:09.730 --> 20:10.731
SO GLAD YOU
CHANGED YOUR MIND

20:10.774 --> 20:11.949
AND DECIDED TO SHOW.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.299
YEAH. HOPE I DON'T
REGRET IT.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.039
MICKEY: ...VERY
DIFFERENT APPROACH.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.258
THANKS TO GOLDEN ANGELES

20:16.302 --> 20:18.434
WIDE RECEIVER SPENCER JAMES,

20:18.478 --> 20:20.306
GREW TO A COUPLE HUNDRED CLIENTS

20:20.349 --> 20:21.959
IN JUST A FEW MONTHS.

20:22.003 --> 20:25.049
SPENCER, WOULD YOU CARE
TO SHARE A FEW WORDS?

20:25.093 --> 20:26.181
YOU'RE GONNA
BE GREAT.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.837
HEY, WHAT CHANGED
SPENCER'S MIND, ANYWAY?

20:29.880 --> 20:31.317
UH...

20:31.360 --> 20:33.362
LESS OF A WHAT,
MORE OF A WHO.

20:37.758 --> 20:39.325
OLIVIA: WHO IS THAT?
JORDAN: THAT'S DAVITA.

20:39.368 --> 20:43.329
SPENCER: THANK YOU.
UH...THIS GYM,

20:43.372 --> 20:46.984
AND MICKEY, ARE A BEAUTIFUL
REMINDER TO ALL OF US

20:47.028 --> 20:48.247
TO NEVER STOP DREAMING.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.337
THERE'S ALWAYS A PATH
TO THAT DREAM.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.773
IT JUST MIGHT LOOK
A LITTLE DIFFERENT

20:52.816 --> 20:54.165
THAN YOU ONCE THOUGHT.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.341
MY DREAM IS TO MAKE IT

20:55.384 --> 20:58.213
TO THE NFL ONE DAY,

20:58.257 --> 21:00.084
AND TODAY, A NEW FRIEND
HELPED ME REMEMBER

21:00.128 --> 21:02.086
WHEN I FIRST STARTED
DREAMING THAT DREAM

21:02.130 --> 21:04.219
BACK IN PEE WEE BALL.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.439
I REMEMBER WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.658
SO, I HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT
ALL THIS MEANS TO YOU, MICKEY,

21:08.702 --> 21:11.182
AND I AM HONORED TO PLAY
EVEN A SMALL PART

21:11.226 --> 21:13.446
IN HELPING YOU GET THIS DREAM.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.143
THANK YOU, MAN.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.232
[APPLAUSE]

21:27.938 --> 21:29.462
OLIVIA, RIGHT?

21:29.505 --> 21:31.899
HI. UM, HAVE WE MET?

21:31.942 --> 21:33.335
NO, BUT SPENCER
MENTIONED YOU

21:33.379 --> 21:35.381
AND I'VE SEEN YOU GUYS
AROUND CAMPUS.

21:35.424 --> 21:36.730
HI. I'M DAVITA.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.122
LAYLA.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.341
YOU MUST BE
THE NEW FRIEND

21:39.385 --> 21:40.342
THAT SPENCER MENTIONED.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.952
GUILTY. WE WERE

21:41.996 --> 21:43.389
RECORDING HIS
INSTAGRAM VIDEO

21:43.432 --> 21:44.520
AND HE
TALKED ABOUT HOW--

21:44.564 --> 21:45.913
SORRY, THERE'S
AN IG VIDEO?

21:45.956 --> 21:48.002
YEP. IT'S DROPPIN' TONIGHT.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.830
PART OF SPENCER'S
WHOLE REBRANDING THING.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.788
REBRANDING?
ARE WE TALKING

21:51.832 --> 21:53.050
ABOUT THE SAME
SPENCER?

21:53.094 --> 21:54.356
IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.357
BRANDING, MARKETING.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.619
IT ALL HELPS
ATHLETES REEL IN

21:56.663 --> 21:58.012
N.I.L. ENDORSEMENT DEALS

21:58.055 --> 21:59.579
AND, IN SPENCER'S CASE,
WILL HELP

21:59.622 --> 22:01.015
HAVE HIM BACK ON
THE FIELD IN NO TIME.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.278
MM. IT'S FUNNY.
AS A COACH'S DAUGHTER,

22:03.322 --> 22:04.497
I WAS TAUGHT THAT
HARD WORK ON THE FIELD

22:04.540 --> 22:06.150
IS WHAT GETS PLAYERS
PLAYING TIME,

22:06.194 --> 22:08.152
NOT POSTING
THIRST TRAPS FOR LIKES.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.938
WOW. OK. UM,
HAVE YOU GUYS TRIED
THE HORS D'OEUVRES?

22:10.981 --> 22:12.418
SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE,

22:12.461 --> 22:14.550
FAN DEMAND CAN INFLUENCE
THE DEPTH CHART.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.987
LIKE I SAID, WITH N.I.L.,
IT'S A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.296
HEY. I SEE
YOU GUYS HAVE MET.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.386
YEAH. IT'S BEEN, UM,
A REAL PLEASURE.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.310
SPENCER ON VIDEO: WHENEVER
MY FEET TOUCHED THE GRASS,

22:35.354 --> 22:36.572
IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.444
I DON'T KNOW HOW
BEST TO DESCRIBE IT.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.054
I JUST KNOW THAT
NOTHING HAD EVER

22:40.097 --> 22:41.403
MADE ME FEEL LIKE THAT BEFORE.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.623
HEY. UH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CRASHING

22:43.666 --> 22:45.233
AT THE BEACH HOUSE
LAST NIGHT.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.408
UH, CHANGE OF PLANS.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.584
I, UM...I WAS JUST TIRED.

22:48.628 --> 22:49.977
WANTED TO BE HOME.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.674
COOP: SO SHE COULD WATCH
SPENCER'S VIDEO

22:51.718 --> 22:53.110
A BILLION TIMES

22:53.154 --> 22:54.677
AND DRIVE US ALL CRAZY.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.636
SORRY. I FORGOT YOU WERE
ASLEEP DOWN HERE.

22:56.679 --> 22:57.550
COOP: NOT ANYMORE.
LAYLA: WAIT,

22:57.593 --> 22:59.639
IS THIS ABOUT DAVITA?

22:59.682 --> 23:01.292
WHO'S DAVITA?

23:01.336 --> 23:04.208
UH...SPENCER'S NEW FRIEND.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.602
OK. UM, AHEM.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.125
ONE DAY IT WON'T
BE AWKWARD FOR US

23:08.169 --> 23:09.518
TO TALK ABOUT THIS,
AND TODAY IS

23:09.562 --> 23:11.651
DEFINITELY NOT
THAT DAY, BUT

23:11.694 --> 23:13.479
SPENCER CARES
ABOUT YOU.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.872
SO HE MET A NEW
FRIEND IN COLLEGE.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

23:15.916 --> 23:18.222
COOP: AIN'T THAT WHAT
YOU SUPPOSED TO DO,
WHEN YOU GO TO COLLEGE?

23:18.266 --> 23:19.485
PATIENCE: IT'S TRUE.
WE'RE NOT, LIKE,

23:19.528 --> 23:20.442
IN HIGH SCHOOL ANYMORE AND

23:20.486 --> 23:22.357
OUR WORLD IS EXPANDING.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.663
I THINK IT'S HEALTHY.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.839
SO, IT'S HEALTHY
FOR MY BOYFRIEND

23:25.882 --> 23:27.275
TO BE TAKING
MAJOR CAREER ADVICE

23:27.318 --> 23:28.885
FROM SOME PERSON
HE BARELY KNOWS?

23:28.929 --> 23:30.670
IS IT HEALTHY FOR
MY BEST FRIENDS

23:30.713 --> 23:32.585
TO NOT BE ABLE TO COEXIST
IN THE SAME ROOM?

23:32.628 --> 23:34.238
WE'RE COEXISTING NOW.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.719
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HONESTLY, IF YOU GUYS

23:36.763 --> 23:38.242
ARE JUST GONNA
TREAT THIS AS A JOKE,

23:38.286 --> 23:39.592
THEN LET'S JUST FORGET
THE GAME NIGHT.

23:39.635 --> 23:40.897
LAYLA: LIV...
OLIVIA: NO, SERIOUSLY.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.333
I MEAN, CLEARLY,
I'M THE ONLY ONE

23:42.377 --> 23:43.509
WHO CARES ABOUT
EVERYTHING CHANGING

23:43.552 --> 23:45.162
AND NOT FOR
THE BETTER, SO,

23:45.206 --> 23:47.730
YOU GUYS DO YOU
AND I'LL WORRY
ABOUT MYSELF.

23:55.695 --> 23:56.652
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
HAVE TO KEEP UP THIS

23:56.696 --> 23:59.350
MONTHLY MOTHER AND SON
BRUNCH.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.527
YOU'RE A BUSY MAN,
SPENCER JAMES.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.615
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

24:02.658 --> 24:03.616
I'M ALWAYS GONNA
MAKE TIME

24:03.659 --> 24:05.922
FOR MY MOMS, OK?

24:05.966 --> 24:07.533
WHAT'S ALL THAT?

24:07.576 --> 24:08.838
YOUR FRIEND DAVITA
REACHED OUT TO ME

24:08.882 --> 24:10.623
FOR SOME EARLY
FOOTBALL MEMORIES.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.494
SHE SAID SHE'S HELPING YOU
WITH YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.669
WAIT. HOW'D SHE FIND YOU?

24:13.713 --> 24:15.279
TWITTER.

24:15.323 --> 24:16.977
MAN, THAT'S GIRL'S
RESOURCEFUL.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.936
BUT LOOKING THROUGH
THESE PHOTOS [CHUCKLES]

24:19.980 --> 24:21.285
HAS TAKEN ME ON A JOURNEY

24:21.329 --> 24:23.026
OF MY BABY'S
EARLY DAYS.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.596
I WAS IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR VIDEO

24:27.640 --> 24:28.641
YOU POSTED, BY THE WAY.

24:28.684 --> 24:31.600
THANKS.
NOT EVERYBODY'S A FAN.

24:31.644 --> 24:34.124
UH-OH. LIV?

24:34.168 --> 24:36.518
YEAH. LET'S JUST SAY
LIV AND DAVITA

24:36.562 --> 24:37.954
DIDN'T EXACTLY CLICK.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.391
DAVITA THINKS THAT
BOOSTING MY SOCIAL MEDIA

24:40.435 --> 24:42.176
IS A GOOD WAY TO GET ME
BACK ON THE FIELD.

24:42.219 --> 24:43.960
LIV DISAGREES AND THINKS
IT STEALS FOCUS

24:44.004 --> 24:45.919
FROM THE REAL WORK.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.573
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:47.616 --> 24:49.575
I THINK THAT COLLEGE BALL
IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD

24:49.618 --> 24:52.099
AND I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

24:52.142 --> 24:55.537
YOU KNOW...I REMEMBER

24:55.581 --> 24:58.322
WHEN YOU WERE IN
POP WARNER

24:58.366 --> 24:59.889
AND YOU HURT YOUR SHOULDER.

24:59.933 --> 25:02.152
AND YOU WANTED TO BE
ON THAT FIELD SO BAD

25:02.196 --> 25:03.719
YOU ASKED TO BE A KICKER

25:03.763 --> 25:05.721
BECAUSE YOU SAID...

25:05.765 --> 25:07.375
PLAYING WAS
ALL THAT MATTERED.

25:07.418 --> 25:10.552
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT TRANSLATE
TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL,

25:10.596 --> 25:12.728
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

25:12.772 --> 25:13.860
[PHONE BUZZES]

25:22.433 --> 25:23.652
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

25:25.088 --> 25:27.482
OH, DUDE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE
MEETING ON CAMPUS.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.136
I GOT PRACTICE.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.746
YEAH. MY BAD.
I JUST

25:30.790 --> 25:32.748
FIGURED I NEEDED
TO DO THIS NOW.

25:32.792 --> 25:36.404
UH, WHAT-WHAT'S THIS?
WHERE'S MY OUTLINE?

25:36.447 --> 25:38.014
I'M REIMBURSING MY FEE.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.668
LOOK, I COULDN'T
PULL IT TOGETHER,

25:39.712 --> 25:41.235
AND TRUST ME,
THAT IS THE FIRST TIME

25:41.278 --> 25:42.541
I'VE SAID THOSE WORDS.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.848
JJ, I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,

25:45.892 --> 25:47.502
OTHER THAN YOU
PLAY FOOTBALL,

25:47.546 --> 25:49.156
YOU LIKE TO WORK OUT,
AND YOU LOVE THE ROCK.

25:49.199 --> 25:50.592
BRO, THERE'S NO WAY
MY SOCIAL MEDIA'S

25:50.636 --> 25:51.854
GONNA SHOW YOU
THE REAL ME.

25:51.898 --> 25:52.986
FOR SOME REASON,
I DON'T THINK

25:53.029 --> 25:54.117
SOCIAL MEDIA
IS TO BLAME.

25:55.510 --> 25:56.685
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

25:59.122 --> 26:01.255
I MEAN, WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME YOU
FACED AN ADVERSITY?

26:01.298 --> 26:03.649
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THE WRINGER FROM
TIME TO TIME.

26:03.692 --> 26:05.433
SPECIFICALLY WHEN
AND HOW?

26:08.654 --> 26:10.220
SEE, IT'S LIKE
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH

26:10.264 --> 26:11.526
ANYTHING REAL.

26:14.224 --> 26:16.400
WELL, THANKS FOR
THE REFUND.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.272
I CAN TAKE MY
ESSAY FROM HERE.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.621
I WAS THINKING OF
USING A LESSER-KNOWN

26:19.665 --> 26:21.841
ROCK MOVIE LIKE
"BE COOL" ANYWAY.

26:21.884 --> 26:26.672
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
BUT...GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.675
I DON'T NEED LUCK.
I GOT THE ROCK.

26:29.718 --> 26:33.679
MAN ON TV: I MEAN, IT WAS
THE ONLY DECISION.

26:33.722 --> 26:34.810
YOU KNOW?
CARLY AND I HAD TO SHOW

26:34.854 --> 26:36.029
A UNITED FRONT FOR THE FAMILIES

26:36.072 --> 26:38.509
AND A BIG PUBLIC WEDDING

26:38.553 --> 26:40.816
SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT MESSAGE.[PHONE BUZZES]

26:40.860 --> 26:41.904
SECOND MAN ON TV:
I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.648
BUT ONE THING
I WANT TO KNOW, UH...

26:46.692 --> 26:48.694
HEY, LOOK, LIV,
I KNOW THINGS ARE WEIRD

26:48.737 --> 26:50.347
BETWEEN PATIENCE AND I

26:50.391 --> 26:51.697
AND EVERYTHING WITH US
THIS MORNING,

26:51.740 --> 26:53.481
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
GOT YOU UPSET,

26:53.524 --> 26:55.222
BUT A FORCED GAME NIGHT
WASN'T GONNA

26:55.265 --> 26:57.006
FIX ANYTHING ANYWAY,
SO, HOW ABOUT

26:57.050 --> 26:59.226
YOU AND I JUST
GRAB DINNER INSTEAD

26:59.269 --> 27:01.097
AND TALK FOR REAL.

27:04.971 --> 27:08.278
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
THOUGHT SONNY WAS DEAD

27:08.322 --> 27:09.889
WHEN HE WENT AWAY FOR 9 MONTHS

27:09.932 --> 27:11.673
AND MISSED OUT ON HIS WIFE
FALLING IN LOVE

27:11.717 --> 27:13.675
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND
AND MARRYING HIM.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.026
THERE'S SOME GOOD
LIFE ADVICE HERE.

27:17.070 --> 27:22.075
I, UH, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.947
SOAPS, THEY AIN'T
REALLY MY THING,
TO BE HONEST.

27:24.991 --> 27:28.951
UM, THEY BE
DOING THE MOST.
NO OFFENSE.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.736
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU DO, TOO.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.476
COOP: EXCUSE ME?
MS. MARITTA: SHH.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.956
IT'S ABOUT TO GET GOOD.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.092
WHY AM I HERE AGAIN?

27:39.135 --> 27:40.571
BECAUSE I DON'T
THINK THAT

27:40.615 --> 27:41.834
SAFRON WOULD'VE
AGREED TO MEET

27:41.877 --> 27:42.922
WITH ME IF I'D
ASKED HER MYSELF.

27:44.140 --> 27:46.186
I JUST WANT TO
BE CLEAR. HEY.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.492
I ONLY TOOK
THIS MEETING AGAIN

27:48.536 --> 27:51.582
BECAUSE I LOVE GRACE JAMES
LIKE A SISTER.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.584
WELL, I
APPRECIATE THAT.

27:53.628 --> 27:56.283
LOOK, YOUR SON'S
ORIGINAL CASE DESERVED

27:56.326 --> 27:57.937
A MORE THOROUGH REVIEW

27:57.980 --> 27:59.155
AND A FAIRER JUDGMENT,

27:59.199 --> 28:02.593
AND FOR THAT
I AM TRULY SORRY.

28:02.637 --> 28:03.725
THE BIAS IN THE SYSTEM

28:03.769 --> 28:05.292
IS ONE OF
THE MAIN REASONS

28:05.335 --> 28:06.902
THAT I STEPPED DOWN
AS D.A.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.731
OK.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.604
I REVIEWED JAMEAL'S
ORIGINAL CASE

28:13.648 --> 28:15.606
AS WELL AS HIS
CURRENT SITUATION

28:15.650 --> 28:18.348
AND HE'S GOT
A REALLY GOOD CHANCE

28:18.392 --> 28:19.959
AT GETTING
AN EARLY RELEASE

28:20.002 --> 28:21.743
BASED ON A HISTORY
OF GOOD BEHAVIOR.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.615
IN FACT, THERE'S
NO DOUBT IN MY MIND

28:24.659 --> 28:25.791
THAT HE CAN GET IT.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.531
SO, I'VE
PUT TOGETHER A LIST OF

28:27.575 --> 28:29.969
GOOD CRIMINAL
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS

28:30.012 --> 28:31.405
THAT CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

28:34.843 --> 28:38.412
I DON'T WANT THEM.
I WANT YOU.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.893
I'M CONFUSED, BECAUSE
THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE,

28:40.936 --> 28:43.809
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT NEITHER YOU OR

28:43.852 --> 28:45.941
ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY
WOULD HIRE ME.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.813
YOU'RE DIFFERENT
THAN I EXPECTED,

28:47.856 --> 28:49.031
AND YOU OWNED
YOUR MISTAKE,

28:49.075 --> 28:51.033
AND YOU BELIEVE
IN MY SON.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.688
BESIDES, A JUDGE
IS MORE LIKELY

28:53.732 --> 28:55.385
TO TRUST A WOMAN
THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU

28:55.429 --> 28:56.517
ABOVE ANYONE ELSE.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.394
AH! CAN YOU
GUYS BELIEVE

29:04.438 --> 29:06.266
THE AUDACITY OF
THAT DUDE RAJ?

29:06.309 --> 29:07.702
NOT HELPING ME
WITH MY OUTLINE,

29:07.746 --> 29:08.921
SAYING I'M
LACKING ADVERSITY.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.271
OF ALL THINGS. ME.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.186
ASHER: YEAH.
OVERCOMING PRIVILEGE

29:13.229 --> 29:14.883
IS SO HARD
THESE DAYS, RIGHT?

29:14.927 --> 29:15.971
SPENCER: LOOK,
THE ONLY ADVERSITY I'VE

29:16.015 --> 29:17.712
SEEN YOU GO THROUGH IS

29:17.756 --> 29:19.453
CRUSHING ON VANESSA WHEN
SHE DIDN'T LIKE YOU BACK

29:19.496 --> 29:22.238
AND HAVING TO SHARE
THE QB SPOT
WITH JORDAN LAST YEAR.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.023
AND NEITHER OF THOSE
ARE GONNA CUT IT
FOR A COLLEGE PAPER.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.807
SPENCER: NOPE.
JJ: YOU GUYS FOR REAL?

29:25.851 --> 29:27.809
AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH TOGETHER?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.158
JJ, I MEAN,
YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR US,

29:29.202 --> 29:31.030
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES
YOU A GREAT FRIEND, BUT

29:31.073 --> 29:32.248
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU COME TO US

29:32.292 --> 29:33.989
WITH YOUR OWN DRAMA?

29:34.033 --> 29:35.512
YEAH, AND REAL TALK, MAN,

29:35.556 --> 29:36.818
I DON'T BELIEVE
YOU AIN'T BEEN
THROUGH NOTHING.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.646
I THINK YOU'RE WORRIED
THAT IF PEOPLE KNOW,

29:38.689 --> 29:39.995
THEY AIN'T GONNA
SEE YOU AS THE COOL,

29:40.039 --> 29:41.301
FUN, SPREAD THE LOVE JJ,

29:41.344 --> 29:42.868
WHICH COULDN'T BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

29:45.914 --> 29:46.959
HEY.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.309
UM...CAN WE TALK?

29:50.527 --> 29:51.572
YEAH.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.839
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU
ALL AFTERNOON.

29:57.883 --> 29:58.840
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.
I GOT

29:58.884 --> 29:59.885
CALLED INTO THE PAPER.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.843
UM...PLUS I FIGURED IT'D

30:01.887 --> 30:03.627
BE BETTER IF WE
TALKED FACE-TO-FACE.

30:03.671 --> 30:04.933
AND I WANNA
CLEAR THE AIR ABOUT

30:04.977 --> 30:05.847
DAVITA LAST NIGHT.

30:07.109 --> 30:09.285
LOOK, I WAS GONNA INTRODUCE
THE TWO OF Y'ALL.

30:09.329 --> 30:10.852
EVERYTHING HAPPENED
SO FAST.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.332
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
SHE WAS COMING.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.855
WHY'D YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT COMING?

30:13.899 --> 30:15.422
BECAUSE DAVITA
REMINDED ME THAT

30:15.465 --> 30:17.903
ANY PUBLICITY
IS GOOD PUBLICITY.

30:17.946 --> 30:21.341
WELL, SHE MUST BE
QUITE THE SALESWOMAN THEN.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.430
BECAUSE YOU HATE
PUBLICITY, SPENCER.

30:23.473 --> 30:26.085
AND SOCIAL MEDIA.
AND ANYTHING ELSE

30:26.128 --> 30:27.086
THAT DISTRACTS YOU
FROM THE GAME.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.304
I HATE THE IDEA
OF NOT PLAYING

30:28.348 --> 30:30.480
IN THE GAME EVEN MORE.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.221
LIV, I KNOW
THIS IS DIFFERENT,

30:32.265 --> 30:34.049
BUT IT'S TIME I STARTED
THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX

30:34.093 --> 30:36.095
SINCE NOTHING ELSE IS
WORKING WITH COACH GARRETT.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.097
YEAH, BUT DOES HE EVEN
CARE ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA?

30:38.140 --> 30:39.925
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST TRYING TO

30:39.968 --> 30:41.927
FOLLOW DAVITA'S LEAD
IN ALL THIS.

30:41.970 --> 30:44.277
SHE'S AN ELITE ATHLETE
WHO'S BEEN WHERE I AM.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.105
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WHERE YOU ARE, BUT

30:46.148 --> 30:49.021
SHE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, SPENCER.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.110
AND YOU'RE SO
CONSUMED WITH

30:51.153 --> 30:54.113
TRYING TO IMPRESS COACH
GARRETT BY ANY MEANS THAT--

30:55.984 --> 30:57.725
I THINK THAT YOU'RE
STARTING TO FORGET

30:57.768 --> 30:58.857
WHO YOU ARE, TOO.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.607
WOMAN ON TV: PHYLLIS WALKED
PAST LENNY'S OLD

31:10.651 --> 31:14.698
FISHING HAUNT
TO RESCUE YOUR WATCH AND

31:14.742 --> 31:17.397
YOU RETURNED HOME
ON JASON AND CARLY'S...

31:17.440 --> 31:19.094
HOLD UP.
YOU BEEN WATCHING

31:19.138 --> 31:21.270
"GENERAL HOSPITAL"
ALL NIGHT?

31:21.314 --> 31:22.576
YOU KNOW THIS SHOW?

31:22.619 --> 31:24.839
YEAH. IT'S
MY GRANDMA'S FAVORITE.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.797
YO, THIS STUFF?

31:26.841 --> 31:28.495
THIS STUFF IS
ADDICTIVE, OK?

31:28.538 --> 31:30.323
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS CHICK
NINA STRAIGHT HIJACKED

31:30.366 --> 31:32.934
9 MONTHS OF SONNY'S LIFE
BY MAKING PEOPLE
THINK HE WAS DEAD?

31:32.978 --> 31:34.718
I'M SURPRISED CARLY
AIN'T KILL HER YET.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.983
SEE, CARLY IS KNOWN
TO SLAP A BITCH [LAUGHS]

31:38.026 --> 31:40.115
SO, IT'LL BE--
IT'LL BE COMING SOON.

31:40.159 --> 31:45.120
WOW. YO...IT'S A SHAME
LIV ISN'T HERE

31:45.164 --> 31:47.296
TO SEE US GETTING ALONG.

31:47.340 --> 31:50.647
I MEAN, YEAH,
SHARING SPACE WITH EXES,

31:50.691 --> 31:51.953
IT AIN'T EASY...

31:51.997 --> 31:53.041
NOPE.

31:53.085 --> 31:54.782
BUT I KINDA KNEW WE'D

31:54.825 --> 31:58.525
FIND OUR WAY BACK TO BEING
FRIENDS AGAIN. RIGHT?

31:58.568 --> 32:01.876
RIGHT. FRIENDS.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.053
MAN ON TV: AFTER THE CEREMONY
WAS OVER

32:05.097 --> 32:07.708
AND ME AND CARLY WENT ALONE...

32:10.232 --> 32:14.106
AHEM. MY LOVE
FOR THE ROCK BEGAN--

32:14.149 --> 32:16.586
MAN, WHAT IS YOUR
OBSESSION WITH THIS GUY?

32:16.630 --> 32:17.979
OK, HE'S THE GOAT.

32:18.023 --> 32:20.460
BUT JUST LET ME
FINISH. PLEASE.

32:22.157 --> 32:25.334
MY LOVE BEGAN WHEN
HE OPENED UP

32:25.378 --> 32:27.249
ABOUT HIS MOTHER'S
SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.383
IT'S THE REASON HE LIVES
EVERY SINGLE DAY

32:30.426 --> 32:32.254
WITH SUCH PURPOSE.

32:34.387 --> 32:39.261
SUMMER BEFORE
MY FRESHMAN YEAR,

32:39.305 --> 32:41.046
MY UNCLE AND I
ALMOST DIED

32:41.089 --> 32:43.048
IN A CAR CRASH
IN HAWAII.

32:44.832 --> 32:45.920
HE'D BEEN DRINKING.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.054
EVERYONE THOUGHT
I SPENT THE SUMMER

32:49.097 --> 32:51.056
LIVING IT UP
ON A BEACH, BUT

32:51.099 --> 32:56.844
TRUTH IS,
I WAS RECOVERING,

32:56.887 --> 32:59.412
AND IT WAS THE ROCK'S
TESTIMONY ABOUT HIS MOM

32:59.455 --> 33:03.807
THAT...STUCK WITH ME
AND GOT ME THROUGH.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.157
IT'S WHY I LIVE EACH DAY
TO THE FULLEST

33:05.200 --> 33:08.508
AND FOCUS ON THE JOY
AND THE POSITIVE.

33:08.551 --> 33:14.166
BUT I GUESS I MISSED
PART OF HIS LESSON.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.603
HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO
SHARE HIS TRUTH WITH THE WORLD

33:16.646 --> 33:20.215
AND...I WASN'T CAPABLE
OF DOING THAT.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.914
EVEN WITH
MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

33:26.874 --> 33:29.050
LIKE THEM KNOWING MY LIFE
WASN'T PERFECT FUN ALL THE TIME

33:29.094 --> 33:31.618
WOULD CHANGE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW. [SNIFFLES]

33:31.661 --> 33:32.880
IT'S STUPID, BUT--

33:32.923 --> 33:34.099
NO, I GET IT.

33:37.885 --> 33:41.236
I'M A QUEER MAN
FROM A TRADITIONAL
INDIAN FAMILY.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.459
SOMETIMES,
SHARING OUR TRUTH,

33:46.502 --> 33:49.418
WHATEVER IT IS,

33:49.462 --> 33:51.159
IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST
EGGS TO CRACK.

33:57.339 --> 34:01.256
WELL, I-I TOOK ANOTHER
STAB AT THE PAPER.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.084
AHEM. C-CAN YOU
GIVE IT A READ?

34:04.781 --> 34:05.913
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.047
THANKS.

34:12.527 --> 34:13.616
GOOD MORNING.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.664
YOU LOOK
MIGHTY CHIPPER.

34:17.706 --> 34:19.969
I GUESS YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDS WORKED THINGS OUT.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.275
WAIT, SO, YOU BEEN
EAVESDROPPING ON ME

34:21.320 --> 34:22.755
INSTEAD OF
WATCHING YOUR SOAPS?

34:22.799 --> 34:24.757
LAST I CHECKED,
IT'S MY ROOM,

34:24.801 --> 34:26.368
AND I CAN LISTEN
TO WHATEVER I WANT.

34:26.411 --> 34:29.893
OK. TRUE.
UH, BUT, YES,

34:29.937 --> 34:34.027
ME AND MY EX ARE
WORKING THINGS OUT.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.377
I MEAN,
THINGS WERE ACTUALLY

34:35.420 --> 34:37.335
PRETTY GOOD BETWEEN US
THIS MORNING.

34:37.379 --> 34:39.033
WORD OF ADVICE
FROM A WOMAN

34:39.077 --> 34:40.295
WHO'S BEEN THROUGH LIFE?

34:40.339 --> 34:41.601
PLEASE.

34:41.643 --> 34:45.126
SIT WITH THE UNCOMFORTABLE

34:45.170 --> 34:46.301
AND DON'T BE IN A RUSH

34:46.344 --> 34:48.389
TO TRY TO FIX THINGS.

34:48.434 --> 34:49.739
THAT'S SOMETHING
MY GIRL

34:49.783 --> 34:52.219
CARLY CORINTHOS
COULD NEVER DO.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.135
WAIT, SO, YOU SAYING
THAT IF CARLY

34:54.179 --> 34:55.831
WASN'T IN SUCH A RUSH
TO TRY TO FIX THINGS,

34:55.876 --> 34:57.791
THINKING HER MOB BOSS
HUSBAND WAS DEAD,

34:57.834 --> 35:00.272
THAT SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
ENDED UP WITH TWO HUSBANDS?

35:00.315 --> 35:02.187
SOMEBODY'S BEEN WATCHING
"GENERAL HOSPITAL."

35:02.230 --> 35:05.538
IT'S BEEN ON IN
THE BACKGROUND. WHATEVER.

35:05.581 --> 35:08.062
I--I'M GONNA MAKE
A PHONE CALL,

35:08.106 --> 35:09.977
SO, EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.720
LAURA: YEAH,
THE PROBLEM IS

35:13.763 --> 35:14.982
SHE WANTS ME BECAUSE
I'M WHITE,

35:15.025 --> 35:16.026
NOT BECAUSE
I'M THE BEST

35:16.070 --> 35:18.203
ATTORNEY FOR
THE JOB.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.161
I MEAN, AS A MOTHER

35:20.205 --> 35:22.163
OF TWO BLACK TEENS,
I GET IT, BUT--

35:22.207 --> 35:24.383
UHH. BABY, NO BUTS.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.776
YOU SAID THAT YOU
WANTED TO BE AN ALLY.

35:26.820 --> 35:30.215
SAFRON TOLD YOU EXACTLY
HOW TO STEP UP.

35:30.258 --> 35:31.172
SURE, SHE WAS
A BIT POINTED,

35:31.216 --> 35:32.608
BUT AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

35:32.652 --> 35:35.176
DO YOU THINK YOU
CAN GET HER SON OUT?

35:35.220 --> 35:37.178
I...KNOW I CAN.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.310
THEN YOU GOTTA
BE THE ALLY

35:38.353 --> 35:39.528
SHE'S TELLING YOU SHE NEEDS

35:39.572 --> 35:41.226
AND BRING THAT BOY HOME.

35:43.619 --> 35:44.707
YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:47.493 --> 35:48.929
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.196
OLIVIA: ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S UP
WITH THE MASS SUMMONS?

35:58.460 --> 36:00.897
LOOK, WE'VE ALL BEEN

36:00.941 --> 36:02.421
GOING THROUGH A LOT LATELY.

36:02.464 --> 36:05.380
A LOT IS CHANGING
AND THAT AIN'T EASY.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.036
RELATIONSHIPS ARE CHANGING.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.126
FOLKS ARE TRYING
TO FIND BOUNDARIES

36:12.170 --> 36:14.998
WITH THEIR COLLEAGUE,
WHO'S ALSO THEIR ROOMMATE,

36:15.042 --> 36:17.131
WHO'S ALSO THEIR BEST FRIEND.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.089
WE GOT PEOPLE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

36:19.133 --> 36:20.787
HOW TO HANDLE THEIR
BUBBLES EXPANDING

36:20.830 --> 36:22.484
TO INCLUDE OTHERS.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.444
LOOK, CHANGE IS UNCOMFORTABLE.
GROWTH IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

36:25.487 --> 36:28.098
HELL, ADULTING IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.230
SO, OUR INSTINCT IS TO RUSH IT

36:29.274 --> 36:31.624
AND TRY TO FIX IT, BUT

36:31.667 --> 36:33.278
IT'S PART OF OUR JOURNEY.

36:33.321 --> 36:35.280
FOR ALL OF US.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.282
SO, WE HAVE TO LEARN TO SIT

36:37.325 --> 36:39.153
IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE,

36:39.197 --> 36:40.633
ME INCLUDED,

36:40.676 --> 36:42.243
AND TRUST THAT

36:42.287 --> 36:44.245
OUR FAMILY IS STRONG ENOUGH
TO WEATHER IT.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.685
SPENCER: COOP'S RIGHT.
COOP: I KNOW I AM.

36:49.729 --> 36:52.035
WE DO NOT WANT TO END UP
WITH TWO HUSBANDS.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.255

PATIENCE: WATCHING TOO MUCH

[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

37:08.530 --> 37:09.618
THANKS FOR COMING.

37:11.490 --> 37:15.058
LISTEN, DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY,

37:15.102 --> 37:18.323
BUT THAT VIDEO,
THE SOCIAL MEDIA STUFF,

37:18.366 --> 37:20.325
IT'S NOT GONNA GET ME
BACK ON THE FIELD.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.414
I MEAN, I GET IT FROM
AN INFLUENCER'S PERSPECTIVE,

37:22.457 --> 37:24.938
BUT...A WIDEOUT
IS ONLY AS GOOD AS

37:24.981 --> 37:26.331
THEY LAST GAME.

37:26.374 --> 37:29.334
NOT THE SNEAKER DEAL
THEY HOPE TO SECURE.

37:29.377 --> 37:32.293
I GOTTA STAY TRUE
TO WHO I AM.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.468
GOTTA DO THIS MY WAY.

37:36.341 --> 37:39.909
YOU SAID YOUR ISSUE WAS
YOU WERE INVISIBLE
TO COACH GARRETT,

37:39.953 --> 37:42.782
BUT THE TRUTH IS
YOU STOPPED SEEING YOURSELF.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.479
THE REAL POINT
OF THIS VIDEO

37:44.523 --> 37:45.480
WAS TO CHANGE
YOUR OPINION

37:45.524 --> 37:47.526
OF WHAT YOU'RE
CAPABLE OF,

37:47.569 --> 37:49.702
NOT LANDING
SOME PARTNERSHIP.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.443
HOLD UP. YOU KNEW WHAT
YOU BEEN DOING ALL ALONG?

37:51.486 --> 37:54.359
HAVE YOU CHECKED YOUR
VIDEO POSTS RECENTLY?

37:54.402 --> 37:55.882
YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF
LIKES AND COMMENTS

37:55.925 --> 37:58.319
POURING IN FROM PEOPLE
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.321
WHEN WE MET 3 DAYS AGO,
ALL YOU DID WAS

38:00.365 --> 38:01.931
DOUBT YOU COULD GET
BACK ON THE FIELD.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.716
ALL THESE PEOPLE
THINK YOU CAN.

38:05.370 --> 38:06.762
FINALLY, YOU KNOW
YOU CAN, TOO.

38:08.198 --> 38:09.330
NOW ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS CONVINCE

38:09.374 --> 38:10.418
ONE MORE PERSON.

38:20.602 --> 38:21.647
COME IN.

38:23.257 --> 38:25.172
ASHER: NEED MORE SUIT APPROVALS?
COACH MR. MONTES: NOT TODAY.

38:25.215 --> 38:26.826
I GOT WORD FROM
JJ'S PROFESSOR.

38:26.869 --> 38:29.350
HE RESUBMITTED A PAPER
THAT BROUGHT HIS GRADE UP.

38:29.394 --> 38:30.960
ACCORDING TO JJ,
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE
BEEN POSSIBLE

38:31.004 --> 38:32.962
WITHOUT YOU.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.790
INITIATIVE GOES A LONG
WAY WITH ME, ADAMS.

38:36.618 --> 38:37.445
THANK YOU.

38:39.795 --> 38:40.840
ONE MORE THING.

38:43.582 --> 38:46.802
YOU WON'T BE FREE FOR
JERSEY PICKUP ON SATURDAY.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.543
YOU'LL BE SHADOWING ME
ON THE SIDELINES.

38:51.024 --> 38:53.200
ASHER: WAIT, SERIOUSLY?
COACH MR. MONTES: YES.

38:53.243 --> 38:56.551
BUT...I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
A WORD OUT OF YOU.

38:56.595 --> 38:58.205
YOU STAND THERE.
YOU LEARN.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.815
QUIET AS MY SHADOW
ON THE GROUND.

39:04.994 --> 39:07.432
YOU GOT SOME LAUNDRY
TO DO OR SOMETHING?

39:07.475 --> 39:08.520
YUP.

39:16.789 --> 39:19.182
HEY. HARD AT WORK?

39:19.226 --> 39:20.575
I FIGURED OUT A PITCH

39:20.619 --> 39:23.099
FOR MY NEXT STORY AT
THE "L.A. TRIBUNE ONLINE."

39:23.143 --> 39:25.885
OH. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

39:25.928 --> 39:31.107
UH...I WANT TO EXAMINE
THE POTENTIAL DETRIMENTS
OF N.I.L.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.282
AND THE BURDEN
THAT IT BRINGS

39:32.326 --> 39:34.284
TO COLLEGE ATHLETES.

39:34.328 --> 39:36.461
THAT'S A CHANGE
OF PACE FOR YOU.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.550
I MEAN, N.I.L.'S
A WHOLE NEW WORLD

39:38.593 --> 39:42.249
AND NOT ALL GOOD,
CONTRARY TO WHAT

39:42.292 --> 39:43.598
SOME PEOPLE MAY THINK.

39:43.642 --> 39:47.210
SO, THIS IS
ABOUT DAVITA.

39:47.254 --> 39:48.603
I THOUGHT YOU
AND SPENCER WERE GOOD.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.039
WE ARE, AND THIS HAS

39:50.083 --> 39:51.258
NOTHING TO DO WITH HER.

39:51.301 --> 39:52.912
N.I.L. IS A HOT TOPIC

39:52.955 --> 39:54.653
AND UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

39:54.696 --> 39:56.437
I MEAN, AS A JOURNALIST,
THIS IS EXACTLY

39:56.481 --> 39:58.439
THE TYPE OF STORY THAT
I SHOULD BE GOING AFTER.

JJ: HEY. I MISSED A TEXT
FROM YOU?

40:13.367 --> 40:14.673
NO. I WAS JUST
AT THE BEACH

40:14.716 --> 40:15.891
AND I FIGURED
I'D STOP BY.

40:17.502 --> 40:21.636
I READ YOUR PAPER
AND WAS BLOWN AWAY.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.682
FOR REAL.
SO MUCH DEPTH
AND HUMILITY.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.466
THAT MEANS A LOT.
THANKS, MAN.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.468
AND AS MUCH AS
I HATE TO ADMIT IT,

40:27.512 --> 40:29.688
I MIGHT HAVE TO CHECK OUT
"BE COOL."

40:29.731 --> 40:32.952

JUST IN TIME, BROTHER.

40:58.804 --> 41:00.458
I WANT TO SWITCH
TO SPECIAL TEAMS.

41:01.763 --> 41:03.504
COACH GARRETT: WHY?
SPENCER: BECAUSE I WAS REMINDED

41:03.548 --> 41:06.289
THAT CHANGE AIN'T BAD

41:06.333 --> 41:07.682
AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

41:07.726 --> 41:09.118
THAN GETTING A CHANCE
TO PLAY,

PLUS, FROM WHAT
I CAN SEE,

WE COULD USE THE HELP.
