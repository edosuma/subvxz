-Okay.

Just a simple contract

It stipulates that my services
as a friend excludes shenanigans.

-Aw, thanks, Guardrail.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.463
"Guardrail." Is that because
you were conceived on the open road?

01:28.547 --> 01:30.173
No, my buddy Throttle gave me that name

01:30.257 --> 01:32.676
because I was so overprotective
of my coke.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.133
Hi, I'm Xiao Huang,

10:33.216 --> 10:36.302
2016 San Gabriel Valley Junior
Table Tennis Champion.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.930
-Do you know where I can find--?
-Ooh, ooh!

10:39.013 --> 10:41.558
That's mine, that's mine. He's with me,
he's with me. Hi, I'm Rebecca.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.475
Hi.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.477
Do you need coffee
before we get started? Espresso?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.688
I just think if it's really meant to be,

10:46.771 --> 10:50.525
you don't need to manufacture
some fake enthusiasm for Josh's hobby.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.319
Isn't a relationship
all about meeting in the middle?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.990
Okay, Dr. Ruth,
I'm paying you for ping pong,

10:57.073 --> 10:59.200
not the hokey pokey
about the hanky-panky.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.620
That's funny. Should I tweet that?
Let's just get back to ping pong.

11:02.704 --> 11:05.498
How do I hold the paddle?
Do I hold it like this or like this?

11:05.582 --> 11:06.875
You hold it like this.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.336
Wait, I look dumb.
I need to look hot. Can you do that?

11:10.420 --> 11:14.299
-Sexy ping pong? Copy that.
-Cool.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.890
There he is. Mr. <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>
but with an inspirational ending.

11:21.973 --> 11:23.850
-Kev, don't.
-I get it.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.895
You want to downplay your courage
and I understand.

11:26.978 --> 11:30.607
I'm just so proud of you, man.
You inspired me to quit kettle chips.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.359
-That's my gateway drug.
-It's not a drug. It's a potato.

11:33.443 --> 11:37.197
Also, you no longer have
to serve alcoholic beverages,

11:37.280 --> 11:40.158
and I've taken beer battered shrimp
off the menu.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.369
-Oh, God.
-Hey, Greg.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.371
Heard you finally figured out
you're an alcoholic.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.498
-I'm happy for you.
-Thanks?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.501
Yeah, I had an ex-boyfriend
who went to rehab for his Oxy addiction.

11:50.585 --> 11:53.630
A lot of ups and downs.
May he rest in peace.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.382
-He died?
-No, but I hope he does.

11:56.466 --> 12:00.261
He stole a lot of 20s out of my purse.
Anyway, I'm pulling for you, buddy.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.472
-We all are.
-Guys, I appreciate your support,

12:02.555 --> 12:06.725
but can we just do our jobs
and not talk about this so much?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.686
I understand.
We should keep things normal.

12:08.770 --> 12:09.979
-That's what we should do.
-Yeah.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.692
Listen up, gang! Be normal!

12:14.776 --> 12:18.279
Greg does not want to be treated
differently for his alcohol addiction,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.198
so be cool!

12:20.281 --> 12:21.324
Be cool.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.953
Emergency meeting called by Serrano.
What do you think it's about?

12:25.036 --> 12:26.537
Did you tell him about you and Rebecca?

12:26.621 --> 12:29.249
-You said you were gonna.
-I haven't seen him! No one has!

12:29.332 --> 12:30.458
He hasn't been around.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.336
-I will tell him at some point.
-Gentlemen.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.130
-What do you think Serrano wants?
-I don't know. Maybe we should ask him
since he's right there.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.760
He's waving us over. 'Sup, man?

12:41.844 --> 12:44.347
-Ghosted on us. Where you been?
-What's this meeting about?

12:44.430 --> 12:47.141
Okay, guys, give him a break.
He's trying to tell us.

12:47.225 --> 12:51.896
Greg, whatever this is,
it concerns all of us, right?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.731
You asked us all to come here

12:53.815 --> 12:58.319
because, I mean, you're not putting
any one individual on blast, right?

12:58.403 --> 13:00.571
Dude, what?

13:00.655 --> 13:03.700
Shh! Let him talk.
Greg, you have the floor.

13:03.782 --> 13:04.826
Sit down, guys.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.080
Here's the thing.

13:09.163 --> 13:14.043
I'm sorry I've been MIA
and that I lied to you.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.088
My mom didn't have botched
plastic surgery.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.590
She did get her nose done recently
and it looks amazing.

13:19.674 --> 13:24.304
But the truth is, I have been dealing
with some things.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.015
Like?

13:27.098 --> 13:30.310
Like I got a DUI, spent a night in jail,
turns out I'm an alcoholic,

13:30.393 --> 13:32.353
I've been going to meetings,
and I'm trying to stay sober.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.022
That's it. Bingo, bango, done. Beers?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.233
Wow. Whoa.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.277
Dude, this is heavy.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.820
[sighs]
I know. It's a shock, right?

13:41.904 --> 13:42.989
Eh...

13:44.115 --> 13:45.450
Or not a shock.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.328
Yeah, no, not really.
Sort of saw that coming.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.372
I am shocked and upset.

13:51.456 --> 13:55.001
Greg, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.085
I feel terrible.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.629
If I did anything to contribute
to this in any way--

13:58.713 --> 13:59.547
What?

13:59.630 --> 14:00.715
[stammering]

14:00.798 --> 14:03.134
I was the one with the fake ID
in high school.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.636
At every party, I would dare you
to drink the whole bottle

14:05.720 --> 14:07.680
because I thought it was funny
or something.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.891
God, I don't know if I can live
with myself anymore.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.642
Weirdly, this isn't about you.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.103
It's okay. Don't give Josh a hard time.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.648
My sponsor, Guardrail--
That's his biker name. It's a long story.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.360
He has a friend named Throttle.
It's a very colorful group of people,

14:20.443 --> 14:23.488
and I'm not supposed to say names,
but I think nicknames are okay.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.199
Just don't tell any of your biker friends,
just cover our bases.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.950
But anyway, Guardrail said,

14:28.034 --> 14:30.953
some people in my life would
take it harder than others.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.830
It's all right, Josh.

14:32.914 --> 14:38.127
No one caused this.
It's me and I'm working on it.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.713
Well, I'm proud of you. Cheers, Greg.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.548
Don't cheers an alcoholic, dumbass.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.385
-It's a light beer, idiot-ass.
-White Josh is right.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.678
I don't think we should
be drinking around you.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.389
No, it's okay.

14:49.472 --> 14:53.518
You don't have the problem, I do.
You guys can drink. I can't.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.353
Let me show you what I mean.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.522
-[festive traditional music playing]
-Come on.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.191
-[all] Cheers!

17:23.084 --> 17:24.919
Dear God, thank you for this boba.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.296
Bless the hands that have rolled
these tapioca balls.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.340
Is that how boba is made? I'm not sure.

17:29.423 --> 17:31.509
Don't you only say grace before a meal?

17:31.592 --> 17:33.928
Boba is a drink that you eat.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.681
Okay. Dude, listen, I'm in a rough place.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.975
Greg is an alcoholic.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.019
I can't tell him about me and Rebecca. He's in such a fragile state.
I don't think he could handle it.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.107
Okay. So--

17:46.190 --> 17:48.818
Now, I know what you're gonna say.
"Be honest," blah, blah, blah.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.487
You know, "Jesus likes honesty,"
blah, blah, blah.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.614
But Jesus didn't have sex
with his friend's ex.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.534
Not that I know of, anyway.
Maybe he did. I don't know.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.286
Josh, stop.

17:58.369 --> 18:02.290
I think your impulse to not tell Greg
is wise and mature.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.209
What? No. Thank you. Really?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.460
Telling Greg would be selfish.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.380
It would only alleviate your own guilt,
blah, blah, blah,

18:09.463 --> 18:11.173
which I guess is how I sound to you?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.258
Mm-hmm.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.011
Josh, you're right.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.763
Greg has a lot on his plate right now.
Don't add to it.

18:17.847 --> 18:20.349
Wow. I'm right about this?

18:21.726 --> 18:24.103
Great, because I really
didn't want to tell him.

18:25.271 --> 18:29.483
Well, you are gonna have a chance
to practice not telling him right now.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.069
So...

18:33.279 --> 18:37.158
There's this thing in recovery
where you own up to your mistakes,

18:37.241 --> 18:41.954
and I'm just starting to do that now,
and I know I need to start with you.

18:42.038 --> 18:44.248
Oh, Greg, you do not have to do this.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.292
Please, just let me get this out.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.420
I am so sorry about the French fries.

18:50.921 --> 18:51.756
What?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.674
You know that time
when we went out

18:53.758 --> 18:55.843
after seeing
your friend's terrible band...

18:56.802 --> 19:01.390
and you ordered French fries and I ate
all of them because I was wasted?

19:02.224 --> 19:05.478
When I think of myself doing that, I am...

19:07.480 --> 19:10.775
That was so selfish of me and I'm sorry.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.986
Wow, I'm really glad
you reached out about that.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.696
-You are?
-No.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.741
I don't remember that at all,
but I will take your French fry apology

19:18.824 --> 19:20.076
and apply it to other stuff.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.078
Okay. That works.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.581
-Did he see me? He saw me?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.001
Okay, I'm gonna walk right up to him,
say a quick hello, and boom, I'm cool.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.586
Yeah, dude,
this is gonna go great for you.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.754
Yeah.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.258
Oh, hey! Nice to see you guys.
How are you?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.469
Hey, man,
we didn't get to talk much earlier.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.389
I heard about you and Valencia.
That's rough. Where are you staying?

19:41.472 --> 19:42.848
Where-- Where am I staying?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.602
Where do I reside?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.562
Where do you hang your hat?

19:48.646 --> 19:51.107
Um... Um...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.859
I have an Airbnb in Claremont.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.529
It belongs to a celebrity.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.781
He uses it as his weekend house.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.409
What celebrity weekends in Claremont?

20:01.492 --> 20:03.577
Oh, I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.913
It's Josh Hutcherson,
but you didn't hear that from me.

20:05.996 --> 20:08.999
[chuckles] He goes there when he wants
to feel down to earth, yeah.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.961
Look, Josh, I know you're weirded out
by the whole alcoholic thing.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.588
I know it's coming
from a place of friendship.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.382
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.800
I think it's kind of nice.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.179
I slept with Rebecca!

20:22.805 --> 20:25.516
-Oh... There it is.
-I'm sorry, what?

20:25.599 --> 20:28.185
It was the night of the wedding
and I'm so sorry.

20:28.269 --> 20:31.814
-You're really good at secrets, Josh.
-You slept with Rebecca that night.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.025
That makes sense.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.488
I was being a drunk jerk
and abandoned her by blacking out.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.991
I can't blame you guys.
I have to take responsibility.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.659
Okay, wait. Before you forgive me,

20:43.743 --> 20:46.328
you should know it wasn't
just the one time.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.955
It's been...

20:53.669 --> 20:55.296
-More than once.
-Yeah.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.673
It's been a lot of times,
and I'm sort of staying with her,

20:57.757 --> 20:59.592
and there is no celebrity
Airbnb in Claremont.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.969
I don't know famous people. I wish I did.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.804
-Stop talking.
-I sold a karaoke machine

21:03.888 --> 21:04.972
to Michael Madsen at Aloha once.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.515
It's okay, Josh. It's cool.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.268
I don't need to know
any more information. We're cool.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.562
Oh, God.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.941
I feel so much better.
[chuckles]

21:16.025 --> 21:18.861
Let's just put this behind us, okay?

21:18.944 --> 21:21.697
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.831
Okay. Bye.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.752
Yeah. What a mess.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.380
Yeah, good job.

21:38.464 --> 21:42.551
I'm sorry. Did you just bro-hug the guy
that's sleeping with your ex-girlfriend?

21:43.469 --> 21:44.386
Yeah.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.931
Okay, but you're, like,
upset about it, right?

21:47.014 --> 21:49.725
You really liked Rebecca.
You dicked me over for her.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.645
It's, like, kind of important to me
that you be upset about this, Greg.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.730
Listen, what Rebecca and I had together

21:54.814 --> 21:58.609
was an undefined thing
followed by a nightmare wedding date,

21:58.692 --> 22:00.569
and then I didn't call her for a month.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.406
Dude, you're getting sober.
You're not turning into a robot.

22:04.490 --> 22:07.993
-It's okay to have feelings.
-It's fine. I'm okay.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.579
I'm, uh... I'm doing amazing.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.957
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm bringing donuts to my next meeting.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.876
I know that doesn't sound
like a big deal, but it is. Oh, it is.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.920
So I, um...
I actually have to go to work now.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.713
-I'm working a double.
-Yeah.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.590
-Take care, Heather.
-But...

Hey. What are you doing?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.659
I'm just stretching
for my private ping pong lesson

22:48.742 --> 22:50.578
in the conference room
with an 11-year-old child.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.747
Of course, 'cause
that makes perfect sense.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.834
Okay. Hey, listen, I just came in
to remind you that today is Friday.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.503

Oh...

23:08.679 --> 23:12.600
Right. Oh, oh, oh,
the letter, the letter, the letter.

23:12.683 --> 23:17.146
Okay. Can I get it to you tonight
at literally, like, 2:00 a.m.?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.939
Can you submit it at 2:00 a.m.?

23:19.857 --> 23:21.275
Yes. Yup.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.027
Yeah. That's no problem at all.

23:23.110 --> 23:26.155
I mean, or, you know,
I could just use Darryl's letter, I guess.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.033
No. Oh, come on,
don't use Darryl's letter. I love the guy, but he can't even spell
the word "separate."

23:31.994 --> 23:34.580
-No, I'll do it, I'll do it.
-Okay. I don't know.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.791
I'm just kinda getting the feeling that
maybe you don't want to write the letter?

23:37.875 --> 23:41.419
Oh, my God, no, you're hurting my heart.
Of course, I want to write it.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.924
Ugh! But Xiao just got here,
and I don't want to be rude,

23:45.007 --> 23:48.385
because he's an 11-year-old child,
but, Paula, I will write it, okay?

23:48.469 --> 23:51.597
I promise. I always keep my promises.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.266

A Lannister always pays her debts.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.311

so no spoilers.

23:57.394 --> 23:58.938
Okay.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.152
-Darryl, what were you doing?
-Ned Stark dies, by the way.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.528
But he's the show.

24:06.612 --> 24:09.531
-Don't get too used to Robb, either.
-[gasps] No.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.705
You know what?
You're getting a lot better at this.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.332
And do I-- do I look hot?

24:18.415 --> 24:19.291
Uh...

24:19.375 --> 24:22.503
-Yeah?
-Thank you, young man.

24:22.586 --> 24:26.215
This is so great, 'cause when Josh sees
that I'm good at ping pong,

24:26.298 --> 24:28.926
he's gonna know
that I'm cool and independent,

24:29.009 --> 24:30.761
and he's gonna be really impressed.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.597
And I know exactly
what he's gonna say to himself.

Why are all of my friends
in love with this girl?

27:37.823 --> 27:40.409
So, she's still working
on the recommendation?

27:40.492 --> 27:43.328
Uh, yeah, but it's okay.
She's gonna get it to me tonight.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.247
She's got a lot of work to do. Okay?

27:45.330 --> 27:47.791
She's got a lot going on in her life.
She's busy.

27:47.875 --> 27:49.751
I shouldn't have asked her
for such a big favor.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.296
What? I don't think it's such a big favor.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.131
I mean, after everything
you've done for her--

27:54.214 --> 27:55.883
That she didn't ask for.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.177
She did ask you to throw a rock
through a window.

27:58.260 --> 27:59.178
Okay, okay.

27:59.261 --> 28:02.014
Look, she's...
she's young, she's confused.

28:02.097 --> 28:06.018
Wow. You are really making excuses
for her, more than you would for our kids.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.103
That's 'cause she's better
than our kids, Scott.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.647
Okay? She didn't pull a knife
on Aunt June, for starters.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.358
Paula, she owes you.

28:13.442 --> 28:17.070
Oh. Oh-ho-ho. No, no, no. Uh-uh.
She does not owe me, okay?

28:17.154 --> 28:19.489
She is my friend and she is busy.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.325
And, you know, I don't know.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.286
Maybe she thinks this whole
law school thing is dumb, okay?

28:24.369 --> 28:25.787
And maybe it is. I'm old.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.374
Maybe-- Maybe it's too late.
Maybe this whole thing is dumb.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.667
It's not dumb.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.711
Your dreams are not dumb.

28:33.795 --> 28:37.841
And I know Rebecca doesn't think that.
She's a very smart girl.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.135
Hey, suck my paddle, losers!

28:40.219 --> 28:43.472
All right, let's Mama have some. Okay.
No, no, Daddy's gonna take that one. Okay.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.516
All right. All right.
Goldilocks wants some porridge. Okay.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.977
Oh. Okay. You got it, all right.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.437
Okay. Yup.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.606
I thought you said she was a champion.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.107
She did say she was rusty.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.194
Okay, attaboy. Attaboy, Xiao.
Yeah, yeah. I'm with him, I'm with him.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.405
-Dude, where's Greg?
-Yeah. He should be here by now.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.532
He's probably on his way.
I'll get him a beer.

29:02.616 --> 29:04.910
-Dude.
-What?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.204
-I don't know the rules.
-There is one rule.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.456
You guys told Greg to come here?

29:09.539 --> 29:11.959
Tonight? Why would you do that?

29:12.042 --> 29:13.710
Why do you care?

29:14.628 --> 29:17.506
Oh, my God. You told him?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.591
-You told me to tell him.
-Tell him what?

29:19.675 --> 29:22.719
Josh and Rebecca are having sex
and basically living together.

29:22.803 --> 29:25.555
-What?
-We're not living together.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.099
I'm just crashing at her apartment.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.685
-Okay, you tell yourself that.
-Wait, wait, wait, hold up.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.187
So, Greg knows
that you and Rebecca are together?

29:32.271 --> 29:35.607
Oh, no, Greg is probably freaking out.
Is that why he's not here?

29:35.691 --> 29:38.944
He said he was gonna come here right
after his meeting. He should be here.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.028
Yeah, where is he?

29:44.616 --> 29:46.952
Your boy never showed with the donuts.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.537
Shut up, Hubcap.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.706
You never put the new guy on donuts.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.126
Yeah, I know.
I thought he could handle it.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.297
Quick question.
Let me just clear something up.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.758
You told Hector
about you and Rebecca, and not me?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.846
-Why?
-Uh, you're a little judgy.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.432
You're a lot judgy.
You're like Judge Reinhold.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.641
He's not a judge.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.185
Guys, I'm really starting to worry.
He said he'd be here.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.813
-Drunk or not, Greg is prompt.
-So, what do you guys think?

30:14.896 --> 30:17.774
I'm a little rusty from my Eastern
Northern Seaboard County District days.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.068
But it's coming back to me.
It's like riding a bicycle.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.280
-What's wrong?
-Greg is supposed to be here. He's late.

30:23.363 --> 30:26.950
And the guys are worried
he's drinking again because...

30:28.035 --> 30:29.619
well, he's an alcoholic.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.998
I know. I'm not supposed to tell people,
but this is an emergency.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.294
Okay. What makes you think
he's drinking again?

30:38.503 --> 30:41.548
Because I told him the truth
about you and me.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.050
You did what?

30:49.473 --> 30:52.976
Josh, you told Greg about us?

30:53.060 --> 30:55.520
Remember, you and I decided
it was wrong to have sex

30:55.604 --> 30:59.107
-because Greg didn't know about us.
-Uh-huh.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.068
So, when I found out
about the alcoholic thing,

31:01.151 --> 31:04.071
I decided I was definitely
not gonna tell Greg.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.406
-Yeah.
-And then, I told Greg.

31:06.490 --> 31:07.532
Oh...

31:08.367 --> 31:09.701
Okay, um...

31:10.577 --> 31:11.578
How did he take it?

31:11.661 --> 31:14.039
I guess not great
'cause he's disappeared.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.125
Yeah. Good job, you horny monsters!

31:17.209 --> 31:20.337
Oh, I'm sorry. That sound judgy? Good.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.672
-Just not now, Chiphunk.
-Chiphunk?

31:22.756 --> 31:25.092
She thinks you look
like a giant buff chipmunk.

31:25.175 --> 31:26.510
I'll take it.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.929
Okay, maybe we're overreacting.
Maybe Greg's fine.

31:29.012 --> 31:31.765
Yes. Yeah, yeah.
He said he was fine, like, ten times.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.518
Guys, you know that when Greg says
he's fine, that's when he's not fine.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.478
-You know that.
-Maybe they're right.

31:36.561 --> 31:40.232
Maybe Greg is fine.
He'll just have a few and sleep it off.

31:40.315 --> 31:45.195
-One rule!
-Oh! That's the rule. Okay.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.823
Yeah, we should definitely
find him right now.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.032
Home Base is closed,

31:49.116 --> 31:52.160
so if he's out there getting messed up
and drinking again, he won't be there.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.079
I could try the beer garden
on East Cameron.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.206
-I'll try the gastropub on East Cameron.
-Should we carpool?

31:56.289 --> 31:57.541
Smart.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.000
Okay, okay. And where should I go?

31:59.084 --> 32:03.255
-And where should I go?
-No. Not you two. Stay away.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.677
Well, I can stay here in case he shows up.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.554
-That's smart.
-Thanks.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.264
I was a boy scout for years.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.641
I gotta go find him. I can't stay here.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.184
Well, how are you gonna do that?

32:18.311 --> 32:20.897
Paula, thank you so much
for helping me find Greg.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.858
And <i>voila.</i>

32:22.941 --> 32:24.359
Wow!

32:25.694 --> 32:26.820
Intuition. What are you doing here?

32:49.384 --> 32:50.844
Everyone's looking for you.

32:53.013 --> 32:56.266
Not me. I wasn't looking for you.
I just like ducks.

33:01.021 --> 33:04.316
Look, I know you know about me and Josh.

33:06.610 --> 33:09.446
I'm sorry you found out the way you did.

33:09.529 --> 33:10.614
Um...

33:11.615 --> 33:17.078
I wanted to tell you myself...
but I didn't know where you were.

33:18.121 --> 33:22.751
I got a single text from you,
and then you disappeared for a month.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.087
Yeah.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.757
I was embarrassed.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.926
I'm sure you heard.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.304
DUI, alcoholic, blah, blah, blah.

33:34.387 --> 33:38.433
I heard, yeah. I'm... I'm sorry.

33:40.185 --> 33:42.103
I really have been doing a lot better.

33:45.065 --> 33:47.275
But then, I heard about you and Chan.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.443
And...

33:50.028 --> 33:52.864
-And you had a drink?
-No, no, I didn't. I wanted to.

33:52.948 --> 33:55.116
I thought about it. I almost did.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.330
I picked out a drink
and a glass and ice.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.581
And instead...

34:02.791 --> 34:03.833
I hit a wall.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.546
Literally. Punched the hell out of a wall.

34:07.629 --> 34:10.257
-Oh, my God. Oh, ouch.
-Yeah. No, no, I'm okay.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.092
It's actually good.

34:12.175 --> 34:16.221
At least, I didn't use alcohol
to block an emotion.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.475
Look...

34:21.935 --> 34:23.436
At...

34:23.520 --> 34:27.440
The night of the wedding,
you completely broke my heart,

34:27.524 --> 34:32.195
but that's no excuse for me
to be sleeping with your best friend.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.863
And I'm so sorry.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.449
I don't need an apology from you.

34:36.533 --> 34:39.452
Rebecca, when I first met you,

34:39.536 --> 34:43.915
I said, "You're ignoring me,
so you're obviously my type."

34:43.999 --> 34:46.585
I picked you because
you weren't interested in me.

34:46.668 --> 34:48.587
[chuckles]

34:49.254 --> 34:51.256
That's funny
'cause, by the end of the wedding,

34:51.339 --> 34:52.924
you weren't interested in me.

34:53.008 --> 34:56.553
The funny thing is...
and not ha-ha funny, sad funny...

34:58.346 --> 35:00.140
The reason I got a DUI...

35:01.308 --> 35:04.060
was because I was driving over
the next morning

35:04.144 --> 35:05.812
to tell you that I loved you.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.983
But I blew my shot.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.235
And that's my fault.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.863
Life went on without me, and...

35:16.156 --> 35:17.574
you and Josh...

35:19.701 --> 35:21.202
you should be happy together.

35:22.579 --> 35:26.499
You're happy, right?
And he treats you well?

35:26.583 --> 35:27.584
Um...

35:28.835 --> 35:29.669
Yes.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.049
Then everything worked out fine.

35:37.469 --> 35:43.099
Wow, you're like...
you're like this new enlightened person.

35:43.183 --> 35:47.020
Not really. Not yet. Someday, I hope.

35:49.898 --> 35:53.068
Hey, Rebecca?
Sorry, I need a ride back to Torrance.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.820
Yeah, hold on a second.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.906
-Greg, this is Xiao.
-Hi.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.367
We are wearing matching outfits because--

36:00.450 --> 36:03.662
Oh, no, no, I don't--
I don't need to know. It's okay.

36:03.745 --> 36:04.913
-Hi.
-Hi.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.879
Here's the letter you asked for,

36:12.962 --> 36:14.714
I should've written it
the second you asked for it,

36:14.798 --> 36:18.718
so please forgive me
and my garbage self.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.845
Oh, Rebecca...

36:22.806 --> 36:24.724
You know that I thought for a second

36:24.808 --> 36:27.686
maybe you thought that me going
to law school was ridiculous.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.440
What? No, no, no. No.

36:32.524 --> 36:35.402
I'm so sorry that you thought that
for even a second.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.571
Paula, you are so brave.

36:40.448 --> 36:43.493
I had a conversation
with someone recently.

36:43.576 --> 36:46.913
It was Greg. It was last night.
It was at a duck pond.

36:46.996 --> 36:52.210
And it made me realize
that changing your life is hard

36:52.293 --> 36:54.671
and you deserve support.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.965
I want to be there for you.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.429
Don't read it in front of me.
I'll get embarrassed.

37:02.512 --> 37:04.431
Oh, my God, this is so sweet.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.433
Oh!

37:07.392 --> 37:09.477
-Oh, the part--
-It's true. It's all true.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.521
You're the greatest person I've ever met.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.275
Cookie. Oh...

37:15.358 --> 37:20.780
This is a beautiful letter
and I will... I will treasure it forever.

37:22.907 --> 37:26.369
But I had to turn in Darryl's letter
because he gave it to me on time.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.538
-Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
-You know what? Don't be.

37:28.621 --> 37:32.500
His letter was not terrible.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.210
Best friends for life.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.346
What the hell are these?

37:45.430 --> 37:48.391
These are the most expensive
donuts in the city.

37:48.475 --> 37:50.685
Gourmet donuts from the new place
on East Cameron.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.729
[sighs]
We like our usual place.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.900
And you got one dinosaur-shaped donut?
What are we supposed to do with that?

37:56.983 --> 37:59.402
-Fight over it?
-I was trying to make it up to you.

37:59.486 --> 38:02.489
Next time, just get
what you're supposed to get.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.949
Better yet, just show up.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.787
I think I can do that. I hope I can.

38:08.870 --> 38:12.665
Now, let's split this adorable dinosaur
before people see it.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.083
[chuckles]

38:14.167 --> 38:16.294
-You get the butt.
-Yeah.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.174
So he wasn't getting drunk?

38:21.257 --> 38:25.053
He was just sitting there on a bench
with a box of donuts?

38:25.136 --> 38:26.638
Yeah, he was fine.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.933
He was great, actually.

38:30.016 --> 38:33.353
He's, like-- He's learning
to process things differently.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.815
He actually seemed like
he was in a great place.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.233
Oh. Phew.

38:38.316 --> 38:42.237
Man, I am so relieved. That is so good.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.532
So, uh... hey, it all kind of worked out.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.618
Totally. Hey, you said you love
video games. You want to get in here?

38:49.452 --> 38:52.205
Um, I'm not feeling
the video games right now. Actually, I lied to you.
I don't-- I don't like video games.

38:56.626 --> 39:01.714
Just like you lied about ping pong?
[chuckles] What was that about?

39:03.800 --> 39:06.469
I was trying to spend time with you, Josh.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.138
That's what the whole stupid
ping pong thing was about.

39:11.266 --> 39:13.977
You know what, Josh?
You live here. You do.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.895
And you can tell yourself whatever,

39:15.979 --> 39:19.858
but I deserve to be with someone
who treats me well.

39:20.817 --> 39:21.776
Okay.

39:23.653 --> 39:24.529
Wow.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.657
Yeah. Phew. Wow. Okay.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.158
Yeah. Yeah.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.585
Hi, ma'am. Ma'am, excuse me.
You're on the ball. Just-- No, it's right--
Okay, so just move your foot this way.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.256
This shouldn't be this hard.
This is funny.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.759
Okay. No, your skirt
is just so voluminous.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.719
It's like you're in the 18th century.

40:29.802 --> 40:33.056
I don't even know where the ball is
anymore. Oh, okay, you kicked it.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.475
Also, you're not wearing any underwear.
Have a great day. Okay.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.185
[sighs]

40:38.269 --> 40:39.896
Hi. Sir? Sir?
