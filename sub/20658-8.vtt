Good morning.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.343
(laughing) Look at you.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.248
Shaina, high-five.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.416
Ah!

00:15.416 --> 00:17.251
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.119
Benny.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.920
Mr. Harris is my dog's name,

00:19.920 --> 00:22.290
and she's a rescue.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.958
Hey, I spot a birthday boy.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.562
Thank you, thank you.

00:28.562 --> 00:29.930
Um, how did you know?

00:29.930 --> 00:31.599
You're my employee,

00:31.599 --> 00:34.068
and I love you.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.407
Says here you went to grad

00:39.407 --> 00:40.741
school for 12 years and never

00:40.741 --> 00:43.010
graduated?

00:43.010 --> 00:44.612
Very untraditional.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.114
Tell me, what's your greatest

00:46.114 --> 00:47.115
weakness?

00:47.115 --> 00:48.416
Well, I'm legally blind in

00:48.416 --> 00:49.917
one eye, I throw up on

00:49.917 --> 00:51.785
roller coasters, and people tell

00:51.785 --> 00:53.654
me I am not a people person.

00:53.654 --> 00:54.455
(chuckles)

00:54.455 --> 00:56.124
Hi, I'm Adam Conover.

00:56.124 --> 00:56.790
Yeah, it says

00:56.790 --> 00:57.458
your name right--

00:57.458 --> 00:58.626
And this is "Adam Ruins

♪♪

01:09.470 --> 01:10.371
You know what?

01:10.371 --> 01:12.106
Your hair reminds me of my dog.

01:12.106 --> 01:12.840
Mmm.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.974
And I like that.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.176
How would you like this job?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.377
This is a great place to work.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.045
And I don't mean to toot my own

01:18.045 --> 01:19.647
horn, but I'm a pretty good

01:19.647 --> 01:20.348
boss.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.449
I accept.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.716
And no, you're not.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.484
What?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.985
You're a terrible boss.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.287
This is a soul-crushing place

01:26.287 --> 01:28.156
to work, and I accept.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.190
Thanks, I could really use

01:29.190 --> 01:30.023
the job.

01:30.023 --> 01:30.991
Soul-crushing?

01:30.991 --> 01:32.560
But we have a ping pong table,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.828
a jukebox, Nerf guns,

01:34.828 --> 01:36.664
and we still have four--

01:36.664 --> 01:38.332
make that two darts left.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.334
So, yeah, it's a fun office.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.335
These people don't look like

01:41.335 --> 01:42.303
they're having fun.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.237
And you know, a lot of them

01:43.237 --> 01:44.838
aren't even working.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.073
So, why do they have to be here

01:46.073 --> 01:46.907
today?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.142
Uh, 'cause it's a work day

01:48.142 --> 01:49.510
and they have work to do.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.511
Interesting theory.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.679
Let's ask one.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.414
Hi there, uh, Shaina.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.848
Looks like all your work is

01:54.848 --> 01:55.849
done.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.851
So, why are you still here?

01:57.851 --> 01:59.086
Because I'm a hard worker

01:59.086 --> 02:01.589
and I'm working hard.

02:01.589 --> 02:02.956
Is that true, Shaina?

02:02.990 --> 02:06.093
No, I love my work.

02:06.093 --> 02:07.861
Mmm.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.862
Thanks a lot.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.897
The only reason Shaina is

02:09.897 --> 02:11.031
still here is because you

02:11.031 --> 02:13.267
enforce a five day, 40 hour

02:13.267 --> 02:15.869
work week.

02:21.008 --> 02:22.610
Ah, the rhythm of life.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.711
Sorry, but that schedule

02:23.711 --> 02:24.878
you're clinging to is an

02:24.878 --> 02:26.580
outdated relic that does nothing

02:26.580 --> 02:27.881
but exhaust your employees and

02:27.881 --> 02:29.283
hurt your business.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.251
No, it isn't.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.219
That's just how long it takes to

02:31.219 --> 02:32.085
get the work done.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.120
Not true.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.788
Most of that time is wasted.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.023
A recent survey found that

02:36.023 --> 02:38.559
employees spent only 45% of the

02:38.559 --> 02:40.428
work day on primary job duties.

02:40.428 --> 02:41.262
Well, what do they do with

02:41.262 --> 02:42.396
the other 55%?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.631
Mostly browse Facebook and go

02:43.631 --> 02:45.032
to pointless meetings.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.567
Okay, corporate scheduled

02:46.567 --> 02:48.302
this meeting scheduling meeting

02:48.302 --> 02:52.373
to schedule a meeting on our...

02:52.373 --> 02:53.774
schedule.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.545
Well, that's just the way

02:57.545 --> 02:58.246
the work week works.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.380
It's always been that way.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.981
Actually, it used to be way

03:00.981 --> 03:01.915
worse.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.484
100 years ago the average worker

03:03.484 --> 03:04.985
clocked ten hour days

03:04.985 --> 03:06.754
six days a week.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.621
Oh, one day off a week,

03:07.621 --> 03:08.556
that's not bad.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.490
Off nothing.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.124
(whistle blows)

03:11.124 --> 03:12.760
On Sundays we had to go to

03:12.760 --> 03:15.729
church.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.164
Oh, Heavenly Father...

03:17.164 --> 03:18.432
Back then, most workers

03:18.432 --> 03:20.768
rarely had even a single day

03:20.768 --> 03:22.002
all to themselves.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.271
Luckily, there were two groups

03:23.271 --> 03:24.438
that fought for the modern

03:24.438 --> 03:26.240
Saturday-- labor unions.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.441
Workers' rights!

03:27.441 --> 03:29.277
Workers' rights!

03:29.277 --> 03:30.411
And Jewish people.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.845
So, it would be nice to take

03:31.845 --> 03:33.414
the day to go to temple,

03:33.414 --> 03:34.782
maybe visit your bubbie

03:34.782 --> 03:35.949
or what have you.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.285
And those two groups had an

03:37.285 --> 03:38.852
unlikely ally-- the founder of

03:38.852 --> 03:40.854
Ford Motor Company, Henry Ford.

03:40.854 --> 03:44.024
Yes, in 1926 I gave all my

03:44.024 --> 03:46.627
workers two days off a week.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.195
This inspired numerous companies

03:48.195 --> 03:49.363
to follow suit.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.631
Wow, Henry Ford,

03:50.631 --> 03:51.999
the original good boss.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.734
Hashtag, #GoodBoss!

03:53.767 --> 03:55.469
Also, I know who's

03:55.469 --> 03:57.771
responsible for World War I--

03:57.771 --> 03:58.639
the Jews.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.973
Oh, jeez, get it off!

03:59.973 --> 04:00.974
Get it off!

04:00.974 --> 04:02.009
Oy.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.777
Henry Ford was super racist

04:03.777 --> 04:06.447
and he despised labor unions.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.348
So, he didn't help change the

04:07.348 --> 04:08.349
work week out of love for these

04:08.349 --> 04:09.182
guys.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.285
Correct, I did it for me.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.454
Overworked employees are less

04:13.454 --> 04:14.822
productive, and worse yet,

04:14.822 --> 04:17.491
have no time to buy my stuff.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.659
You there, why aren't you out

04:18.659 --> 04:19.893
buying a car?

04:19.893 --> 04:21.161
I'm building one.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.331
Fine, take the day off and go

04:23.331 --> 04:24.498
buy a car.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.567
Ford wins again.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.803
(laughing)

04:29.803 --> 04:32.039
Ford didn't give an F-150

04:32.039 --> 04:33.341
about his employees' leisure

04:33.341 --> 04:34.174
time.

04:34.174 --> 04:35.208
He helped create Saturday

04:35.208 --> 04:36.810
because he knew it would be good

04:36.810 --> 04:37.911
for business.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.313
And as technology improved and

04:39.313 --> 04:41.048
productivity rose, everyone

04:41.048 --> 04:42.316
thought the work week would keep

04:42.316 --> 04:43.250
getting shorter.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.152
In 1930, the economist John

04:45.152 --> 04:46.920
Maynard Keynes predicted...

04:46.920 --> 04:48.922
By 2030, we will be working

04:48.922 --> 04:50.491
for as little as 15 hours a

04:50.491 --> 04:51.325
week.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.561
Even Richard Nixon agreed.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.529
The four-day work week is

04:55.529 --> 04:57.898
inevitable within our time.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.067
Also, I hate Jews.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.569
(tape rewinding)

05:01.569 --> 05:03.036
I hate Jews.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.338
God, I love this little tape

05:04.338 --> 05:05.506
recorder.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.507
And for a while, it looked

05:06.507 --> 05:08.041
like they might have been right.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.077
For decades work hours steadily

05:10.077 --> 05:11.512
decreased.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.780
But in the '70s, Americans

05:12.780 --> 05:14.081
started working longer and

05:14.081 --> 05:15.416
longer hours.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.385
We now work nearly four more

05:17.385 --> 05:19.353
weeks a year than we did in

05:19.353 --> 05:21.288
1979.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.056
And all those extra hours are

05:23.056 --> 05:24.425
actually terrible for your

05:24.425 --> 05:25.258
business.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.760
Overtime increases the rate of

05:26.760 --> 05:28.128
mistakes and safety mishaps

05:28.128 --> 05:31.031
among industrial workers by 61%.

05:31.031 --> 05:31.899
(paper shredder whirring)

05:31.899 --> 05:32.800
No, no.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.134
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:34.134 --> 05:35.736
And longer hours also lowered

05:35.736 --> 05:36.970
the scores on cognitive

05:36.970 --> 05:38.138
performance tests, which means

05:38.138 --> 05:39.473
you are literally working your

05:39.473 --> 05:40.774
employees stupid.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.543
He am?

05:42.543 --> 05:43.477
No, I'm not.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.745
Our hard work is why we're the

05:44.745 --> 05:45.913
richest country in the world.

05:45.913 --> 05:46.914
(chuckles) No, it isn't.

05:46.914 --> 05:47.815
There are plenty of wealthy

05:47.815 --> 05:48.949
countries that work far less

05:48.949 --> 05:49.883
than we do.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.884
Workers in Germany, the

05:50.884 --> 05:52.553
strongest economy in Europe,

05:52.553 --> 05:54.655
work an average of 400 hours

05:54.655 --> 05:55.789
less a year than the average

05:55.789 --> 05:56.757
American worker.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.891
Yeah, our lives are better

05:57.891 --> 05:58.626
than yours.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.060
Do you have any idea how much

06:00.060 --> 06:02.563
400 hours a year is?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.565
That's ten full work weeks.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.433
What?!

06:05.433 --> 06:07.468
That's crazy!

06:09.670 --> 06:11.304
Look, working long just isn't

06:11.304 --> 06:13.240
the same thing as working hard.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.108
Your employees would be happier,

06:15.108 --> 06:16.777
healthier and more productive

06:16.777 --> 06:18.245
if they had more time off.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.447
Not to mention, you'd be more

06:19.447 --> 06:20.180
popular.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.582
Ooh, I do like that.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.616
But how do I know a shorter work

06:22.616 --> 06:24.284
week won't ruin my bottom line?

06:24.284 --> 06:25.118
Well, let's talk to a boss

06:25.118 --> 06:26.086
who had the guts to actually

06:26.086 --> 06:26.954
try it.

06:26.954 --> 06:27.655
(chuckles)

06:27.655 --> 06:30.023
Ah, meet Ryan Carson.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.092
He's the CEO of Treehouse,

06:32.092 --> 06:33.461
an online school.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.294
Hey, Benny.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.929
So, yeah, in 2006 we switched

06:35.929 --> 06:37.130
to a four-day work week for our

06:37.130 --> 06:38.131
entire company.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.100
And this is good for your

06:40.100 --> 06:40.934
business?

06:40.934 --> 06:41.802
So, it just seemed to make

06:41.802 --> 06:42.703
a lot of sense.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.604
When people come to work

06:43.604 --> 06:44.838
well-rested, they have more

06:44.872 --> 06:46.807
energy and better ideas.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.375
We're also able to retain

06:48.375 --> 06:50.478
top talent for longer, which

06:50.478 --> 06:52.212
saves us a ton of money in the

06:52.212 --> 06:52.980
long term.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.147
Well, that's very compelling.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.816
And it's not just good for

06:55.816 --> 06:56.650
business.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.985
You know, if I'm lucky,

06:57.985 --> 06:59.653
I have 2,500 weekends left in my

06:59.653 --> 07:00.954
entire life.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.490
And with the four-day work week,

07:02.490 --> 07:04.825
I get 50% more time with my wife

07:04.825 --> 07:05.826
and kids.

07:05.826 --> 07:06.894
That's what's important to me.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.061
Yeah, it'd be wonderful to

07:08.061 --> 07:09.463
spend more time with Mr. Harris.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.464
I know it would.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.665
Thanks, Ryan.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.233
Look, American business has

07:13.233 --> 07:14.668
changed so much in the last

07:14.668 --> 07:15.636
century.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.704
But you're still clinging to the

07:16.704 --> 07:18.539
same schedule we used back in

07:18.539 --> 07:20.641
Henry Ford's day out of sheer

07:20.641 --> 07:22.476
habit, even though it hurts

07:22.476 --> 07:23.410
your business.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.012
So, yeah, you are a bad boss.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.213
Hashtag, #BadBoss.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.314
Anyway, when do I start?

07:27.314 --> 07:27.981
(chuckles)

07:27.981 --> 07:28.716
No.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.717
No, no, no, no, no, I'm not

07:29.717 --> 07:31.351
a bad boss, I'm a good boss.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.786
And I'll prove it to you!

07:32.820 --> 07:34.021
This is Trista.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.591
She's an intern here.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.693
I help this young woman develop

07:39.693 --> 07:41.394
the skills she'll need for her

07:41.394 --> 07:42.362
future career.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.598
Oh, Trista, so, uh, do you do

07:44.598 --> 07:45.533
real work here?

07:45.533 --> 07:46.500
Yeah.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.703
And do you get paid?

07:49.703 --> 07:50.370
No.

07:50.370 --> 07:51.505
Oh, well, congratulations,

07:51.505 --> 07:52.706
Benny, you're a criminal.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.575
What?

07:56.376 --> 07:57.845
Oh, man, is this my desk?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.112
This is so cool.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.548
Could we make it a standing desk

08:00.548 --> 08:01.248
though?

08:01.248 --> 08:03.383
Standing is really good for you.

08:03.383 --> 08:04.618
Though I do love to lean on

08:04.618 --> 08:05.886
occasion, and squatting has

08:05.886 --> 08:06.854
recently been shown to--

08:06.854 --> 08:07.621
Oh, I don't know, maybe I

08:07.621 --> 08:08.388
should have hired another

08:08.388 --> 08:09.122
intern.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.358
Ah, yes, the great American

08:11.358 --> 08:12.292
intern.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.694
They get our coffee, they make

08:13.694 --> 08:14.562
our copies.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.296
And sure, they may not be paid,

08:16.296 --> 08:17.731
but they receive something far

08:17.731 --> 08:19.466
more valuable in return--

08:19.466 --> 08:21.902
skills and experience.

08:21.902 --> 08:22.970
Finally making some sense,

08:22.970 --> 08:23.637
Adam.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.872
Maybe it wasn't a big mistake--

08:24.872 --> 08:25.873
Yeah, too bad that's a total

08:25.873 --> 08:26.607
myth.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.041
Internships are nothing but a

08:28.041 --> 08:29.309
way for companies to exploit

08:29.309 --> 08:31.311
young people for free labor.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.412
And in many cases, they're

08:32.412 --> 08:34.047
totally illegal.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.382
Whoa, really?

08:35.382 --> 08:36.584
Trista just gets us coffee

08:36.584 --> 08:37.284
and stuff.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.418
Who says that's illegal?

08:38.418 --> 08:39.486
The Department of Labor.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.387
Who says they say that?

08:40.387 --> 08:41.254
The former Secretary of

08:41.254 --> 08:42.856
Labor.

08:44.424 --> 08:45.325
(snaps)

08:45.325 --> 08:46.426
Meet Robert Reich.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.561
He was Secretary of Labor under

08:47.561 --> 08:48.295
Bill Clinton.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.096
Now, he lives in this

08:49.096 --> 08:49.830
PowerPoint.

08:49.830 --> 08:50.931
Yeah, well, times are tough.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.899
Hi, Adam.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.000
According to the Labor

08:53.000 --> 08:54.935
Department, internships are only

08:54.935 --> 08:57.270
legal if it's for the benefit of

08:57.270 --> 08:58.939
the interns, not the company,

08:58.939 --> 08:59.940
the payment isn't just the

08:59.940 --> 09:01.609
promise of a job at the end,

09:01.609 --> 09:03.443
it doesn't displace any regular

09:03.443 --> 09:05.145
employees, and it's similar to

09:05.145 --> 09:06.279
what you'd learn in an

09:06.279 --> 09:07.615
educational environment.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.816
Thanks, Bob, stick around.

09:08.816 --> 09:09.950
We're gonna need you later.

09:09.950 --> 09:13.353
It's okay, I'll pause myself.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.588
And like most unpaid

09:14.588 --> 09:16.156
internships, you are blatantly

09:16.156 --> 09:17.791
violating these rules.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.759
Trista's doing the work of a

09:18.759 --> 09:20.360
secretary, she's not benefitting

09:20.360 --> 09:21.595
or learning anything.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.630
Yes, she is, she's learning

09:22.630 --> 09:24.131
important business terms.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.634
Yeah, like "tall", "grande",

09:26.634 --> 09:29.970
"pumpkin spice", "half-caf".

09:29.970 --> 09:31.304
It makes her more employable.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.505
Actually, a new study

09:32.505 --> 09:34.107
suggests that unpaid interns go

09:34.107 --> 09:35.843
on to have nearly exactly the

09:35.843 --> 09:37.477
same hiring rate as people who

09:37.477 --> 09:39.446
have never interned at all.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.848
Really?

09:40.848 --> 09:41.815
Yeah.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.483
And because you're not being

09:43.483 --> 09:45.485
paid anything, someone else has

09:45.485 --> 09:47.054
to support you while you work

09:47.054 --> 09:47.955
for free.

09:47.955 --> 09:48.989
My mom pays my rent.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.724
Yeah, and you're lucky.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.625
People from lower income

09:51.625 --> 09:53.060
families can't take internships

09:53.060 --> 09:54.061
because we have to support

09:54.061 --> 09:54.962
ourselves.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.463
I literally cannot afford to

09:56.463 --> 09:57.497
work here.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.632
That's messed up.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.634
That's an excellent point.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.035
(scoffs)

10:02.035 --> 10:03.871
Trista, you deserve to get

10:03.871 --> 10:05.906
paid as much as anyone.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.507
But Benny here is asking you to

10:07.507 --> 10:09.743
get coffee for free, and all

10:09.743 --> 10:11.078
he's offering in return is the

10:11.078 --> 10:12.479
promise of a job that will

10:12.479 --> 10:13.914
never come.

10:13.914 --> 10:16.183
You know what, Mr. Harris?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.151
Get your own damn coffee.

10:20.688 --> 10:21.989
If this were full, that would

10:21.989 --> 10:24.024
have been really bad-ass.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.826
Okay, I know this looks bad.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.494
Adam, we are good folk here.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.862
We have volunteer team-building,

10:28.862 --> 10:30.197
I give people jobs.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.164
Eric! Eric!

10:31.164 --> 10:31.832
Hey.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.666
Eric started here as an

10:32.666 --> 10:33.901
intern, and now look at him.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.535
He works here as a freelancer!

10:35.535 --> 10:36.937
Oh, a freelancer.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.205
So, you must set your own hours.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.206
No, I have to be here from

10:39.206 --> 10:40.040
9 to 5.

10:40.040 --> 10:40.874
Can I leave early today?

10:40.874 --> 10:42.042
Oh, I'm sorry, I just don't

10:42.042 --> 10:43.043
have the bandwidth.

10:43.043 --> 10:43.777
Well, they must give you

10:43.777 --> 10:44.444
benefits.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.578
No, but we get free cupcakes

10:45.578 --> 10:47.214
on Fridays, and sometimes

10:47.214 --> 10:48.015
there's enough left over

10:48.015 --> 10:49.382
for lunch.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.884
Well, sounds like he's

10:50.884 --> 10:52.385
working here illegally.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.253
Illegally?!

10:53.253 --> 10:54.354
We can't have that.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.223
Boys, take him to jail!

10:56.223 --> 10:58.058
No, no, stop!

10:58.058 --> 11:00.027
Benny, you're the one who's

11:00.027 --> 11:01.028
breaking the law.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.029
Here, let's talk to Robert Reich

11:02.029 --> 11:03.396
again.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.231
Crap, ow!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.065
Oh, Bobby!

11:05.065 --> 11:06.033
Ow, ow!

11:06.033 --> 11:08.035
I've gone to screensaver!

11:08.035 --> 11:09.102
Thanks.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.237
The misclassification of

11:10.237 --> 11:11.604
salaried employees as

11:11.604 --> 11:12.973
freelancers is a very common

11:12.973 --> 11:14.574
problem in corporate America.

11:14.574 --> 11:15.743
A company is probably working

11:15.743 --> 11:17.711
you as a freelancer illegally

11:17.711 --> 11:19.112
if they...

11:19.112 --> 11:21.148
impose requirements over you on

11:21.148 --> 11:22.750
shift times, meetings or office

11:22.750 --> 11:24.217
attendance,

11:24.251 --> 11:25.786
don't give you the freedom to

11:25.786 --> 11:27.721
work for other companies,

11:27.755 --> 11:29.422
or just in general, treat you

11:29.422 --> 11:30.423
like staff.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.091
Thanks, Bob.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.092
Uh, wait, wait.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.126
Could you move the mouse again

11:33.126 --> 11:34.594
before...

11:34.594 --> 11:37.464
Ahh!

11:37.464 --> 11:38.932
Adam, I hear your concerns,

11:38.932 --> 11:40.333
but we still hire a staff and

11:40.333 --> 11:41.935
they're not going anywhere.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.403
Yes, they are.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.974
In 1995, 93% of American workers

11:46.974 --> 11:48.275
were full-time or part-time

11:48.275 --> 11:49.109
staff.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.244
But today, nearly one in three

11:51.244 --> 11:53.280
are freelance or temp.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.314
Why do you think that is?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.282
We hire freelancers because

11:55.282 --> 11:56.083
they're cheap.

11:56.083 --> 11:56.917
Aha!

11:56.917 --> 11:59.319
Yep, bosses like you love to

11:59.319 --> 12:00.653
cut corners.

12:00.653 --> 12:01.955
That's why you turn staffers

12:01.955 --> 12:03.490
into freelancers, so you don't

12:03.490 --> 12:04.624
have to pay them the benefits

12:04.624 --> 12:06.293
they're entitled to.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.461
By avoiding unemployment, taxes,

12:08.461 --> 12:10.430
workman's comp and health care,

12:10.430 --> 12:13.834
you save up to 30% on wages.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.969
What?!

12:15.969 --> 12:18.505
That's crazy!

12:23.543 --> 12:25.846
Yes, it is crazy just how

12:25.846 --> 12:28.281
much you're being cheated.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.986
Come on, Adam.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.487
Look at all these fun perks.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.156
In this economy, we all have to

12:36.156 --> 12:37.157
make sacrifices.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.225
That's the only way a business

12:38.225 --> 12:39.059
is gonna survive.

12:39.059 --> 12:39.893
(funk music playing)

12:39.893 --> 12:40.560
(record skipping)

12:40.560 --> 12:42.029
Don't blame the economy.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.630
Even taking the recession into

12:43.630 --> 12:45.132
account, American businesses

12:45.132 --> 12:47.801
make more money now than ever,

12:47.801 --> 12:49.469
yet wages haven't risen to

12:49.469 --> 12:51.171
match, all because companies

12:51.171 --> 12:52.505
keep pleading poverty and

12:52.505 --> 12:54.341
"making sacrifices."

12:54.341 --> 12:55.375
So, tell you what.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.643
Why don't you skip all the

12:56.643 --> 12:58.045
meaningless perks and give

12:58.045 --> 13:00.380
Trista and Eric a proper salary

13:00.380 --> 13:02.049
with benefits?

13:02.049 --> 13:02.816
Yeah.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.384
We don't need a ping pong table

13:04.384 --> 13:05.886
or a break room with a Wii

13:05.886 --> 13:06.586
in it.

13:06.586 --> 13:07.487
We need money.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.755
Trista agrees.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.323
I can't even eat cupcakes.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.558
I'm hypoglycemic.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.225
Yeah!

13:12.225 --> 13:13.260
Why do you even bother,

13:13.260 --> 13:13.927
Benny?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.395
Because-- because those

13:15.395 --> 13:17.230
meaningless perks are cheaper,

13:17.230 --> 13:18.198
okay?

13:18.198 --> 13:19.099
You got me.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.600
I try to win your loyalty with

13:20.600 --> 13:21.869
sugar and Nerf, and I got

13:21.869 --> 13:22.936
caught.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.404
Are you happy, Adam?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.205
Like, in general,

13:25.205 --> 13:26.239
or right now?

13:26.239 --> 13:27.707
Eh, the answer to both is yes.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.375
(chuckles)

13:28.375 --> 13:30.911
(dinging, coins jingling)

13:30.911 --> 13:32.579
The paychecks are here!

13:32.579 --> 13:33.713
(laughing)

13:33.713 --> 13:35.382
Paychecks are here!

13:35.382 --> 13:37.784
♪ Payday, payday

13:37.784 --> 13:40.220
♪ Everyone loves me on payday

13:40.220 --> 13:41.354
(humming)

13:41.354 --> 13:43.256
Oh... I like this better than

13:43.256 --> 13:43.957
direct deposit.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.558
I like to feel my money.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.027
Oh, what's your salary?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.761
Benny offered me 75K.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.063
You just can't tell people

13:50.063 --> 13:51.231
your salary like that.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.265
Oh, no, there are numerous

13:52.265 --> 13:54.201
reasons I can and should.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.402
And in fact, by telling me I

13:55.402 --> 13:58.071
can't, you are breaking the law.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.806
Guys, not now.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.541
Yeah, I had more to say.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.712
(whistling)

14:05.712 --> 14:07.981
Hey, Vanessa, 35K a year.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.416
Not bad.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.152
Megan, ooh, 70, good going.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.487
Bob, six figures.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.423
Whew, very impressive.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.926
(chuckles) And Charles, six...

14:18.926 --> 14:19.792
dollars?

14:19.792 --> 14:20.760
You only make six dollars

14:20.760 --> 14:21.761
a year?

14:21.761 --> 14:24.731
Asking for a raise is mean.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.266
Stop this right now, Adam.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.567
You can't discuss salaries

14:27.567 --> 14:28.601
openly like this.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.769
Why not?

14:29.769 --> 14:31.271
Because it's illegal.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.173
No, it definitely isn't.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.274
The right to share your salary

14:34.274 --> 14:35.275
is protected by the National

14:35.275 --> 14:36.609
Labor Relations Act.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.577
Employees have the right to

14:37.577 --> 14:38.478
engage in-- ugh.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.446
Man, this comic's boring.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.413
You get the idea.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.281
And being public with your

14:41.281 --> 14:43.816
salary actually benefits you.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.285
So, without further adieu...

14:45.285 --> 14:46.653
No!

14:46.653 --> 14:48.155
I mean, even if it's legal, it

14:48.155 --> 14:49.990
makes me really uncomfortable.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.124
Exactly.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.260
Americans have an enormous taboo

14:53.260 --> 14:54.928
against talking about money.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.296
Most people would rather discuss

14:56.296 --> 14:57.464
their sex lives than their

14:57.464 --> 14:58.198
salaries.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.799
(laughing) Oh, yeah.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.434
So, anyway, that's where I enjoy

15:01.434 --> 15:02.702
fingers during intercourse.

15:02.702 --> 15:03.670
Oh, fascinating.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.772
Say, how much money do you make?

15:05.772 --> 15:06.539
Ah!

15:06.539 --> 15:07.474
How dare you!

15:07.474 --> 15:10.210
Ah! Oh, God!

15:10.210 --> 15:11.811
Look, all that taboo does is

15:11.811 --> 15:13.180
take power away from the

15:13.180 --> 15:14.647
employee and give it to the

15:14.647 --> 15:15.515
company.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.549
But if people know how much

15:16.549 --> 15:18.118
money I make, they'll resent me.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.052
I mean, they'll know that I'm

15:19.052 --> 15:21.488
filthy stinking... middle-class!

15:21.488 --> 15:22.655
No, they won't, they'll

15:22.655 --> 15:24.157
resent the company.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.358
Look, here's what you think will

15:25.358 --> 15:26.826
happen if you share your salary.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.162
I make 85,000 a year.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.298
You dickhead.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.633
You should make less money.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.534
And here's what would

15:34.534 --> 15:35.969
actually happen.

15:35.969 --> 15:39.706
I make $85,000 a year.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.174
You dickhead.

15:41.174 --> 15:42.875
I should make more money.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.411
Bosses like Benny love it

15:44.411 --> 15:45.345
when you keep your salary a

15:45.345 --> 15:47.247
secret, because it tilts pay

15:47.247 --> 15:49.516
negotiations in their favor.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.051
It's a concept called

15:51.051 --> 15:53.153
information asymmetry.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.254
If you don't know what the going

15:54.254 --> 15:55.522
rate is for your salary,

15:55.522 --> 15:56.689
it's easier for the company to

15:56.689 --> 15:58.058
rip you off.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.559
I can only offer you

15:59.559 --> 16:00.927
$100 a day.

16:00.927 --> 16:01.828
I guess that's what everyone

16:01.828 --> 16:02.495
here makes.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.363
And this perpetuates the

16:03.363 --> 16:04.164
pay gap.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.232
For instance, African American

16:05.232 --> 16:07.500
women make 64 cents for every

16:07.500 --> 16:08.668
dollar the average white guy

16:08.668 --> 16:09.369
makes.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.103
I can only offer you

16:10.103 --> 16:11.571
$64 a day.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
I guess that's what everybody

16:13.206 --> 16:14.241
here makes.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.608
The bottom line is if you

16:15.608 --> 16:16.709
don't have all the information,

16:16.709 --> 16:18.711
you could get scammed big time.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.946
We can only offer you

16:19.946 --> 16:21.781
six dollars a year.

16:21.781 --> 16:24.584
I guess that's what everyone

16:24.584 --> 16:27.120
here makes?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.455
(whimpers)

16:28.455 --> 16:30.390
(sighs)

16:30.390 --> 16:32.392
Buddy, how do you survive?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.061
I live here.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.730
Discussing your salary with

16:37.730 --> 16:39.766
your coworkers is your right as

16:39.766 --> 16:40.800
an employee.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.069
When you let these guys stop you

16:42.069 --> 16:43.736
from doing it, you push your own

16:43.736 --> 16:45.472
wages down, which means you're

16:45.472 --> 16:46.906
spending more years of your life

16:46.906 --> 16:48.741
slaving away in a job that

16:48.741 --> 16:50.043
doesn't pay you what you're

16:50.043 --> 16:51.078
really worth.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.213
You're right.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.415
All of this is a waste of time.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.783
(laughing)

16:56.783 --> 16:58.085
You say all these people are

16:58.085 --> 17:00.620
wasted and it's not even 5:00?

17:00.620 --> 17:01.321
It's a joke.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.422
Stop trying to lighten the

17:02.422 --> 17:03.556
mood with your fantastic boss

17:03.556 --> 17:04.257
humor.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.126
This is all your fault.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.960
My name is Shaina Monroe

17:07.960 --> 17:12.432
and I make $30,000 a year.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.601
My name is Becca Neeson

17:14.601 --> 17:17.104
and I make 40,000 a year.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.471
My name is Charles Wicket.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.073
I make six dollars a year

17:20.073 --> 17:22.642
and I demand a raise...

17:22.642 --> 17:23.643
please.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.445
I want a raise too!

17:28.081 --> 17:31.451
(cheering)

17:31.451 --> 17:33.186
More money! More money!

17:33.186 --> 17:34.254
More money!

17:34.254 --> 17:35.322
Yes! Yes!

17:35.322 --> 17:36.589
Share your salaries with the

17:36.623 --> 17:37.457
world.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.526
Negotiate for better wages!

17:39.526 --> 17:41.594
You can achieve informational

17:41.628 --> 17:43.830
symmetry, for knowledge is

17:43.830 --> 17:45.031
power!

17:45.031 --> 17:48.368
Stop right there!

17:48.368 --> 17:50.970
Everybody loved me.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.840
I was a good boss!

17:53.840 --> 17:55.942
And you destroyed everything,

17:55.942 --> 17:57.477
Adam!

17:57.477 --> 17:59.546
Now, you pay.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.513
Don't do it, Benny!

18:00.513 --> 18:02.815
I bruise easily!

18:05.385 --> 18:07.053
Look, don't do it, Benny.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.121
What if the dart hits my good

18:08.121 --> 18:09.622
eye?

18:09.622 --> 18:10.323
(whimpers)

18:10.323 --> 18:11.958
(gun clicks)

18:11.958 --> 18:15.795
We're out of darts!

18:15.795 --> 18:17.664
You're right, Adam.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.400
I'm a bad boss.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.801
Ah!

18:21.801 --> 18:24.204
It's true!

18:24.204 --> 18:26.139
I act like I care,

18:26.139 --> 18:27.807
but it's all a ruse...

18:27.807 --> 18:28.975
(laughing)

18:28.975 --> 18:31.043
...to make my company money at

18:31.043 --> 18:33.546
the expense of my employees!

18:33.546 --> 18:34.681
(sobbing)

18:34.681 --> 18:36.349
What am I supposed to do?

18:36.349 --> 18:37.984
I have bosses too!

18:37.984 --> 18:39.051
If my team doesn't show a

18:39.051 --> 18:41.821
profit, I'm fired!

18:41.821 --> 18:43.256
God!

18:43.256 --> 18:45.325
My life is a lie!

18:45.325 --> 18:47.093
Oh, there, there.

18:47.093 --> 18:48.861
Come on, you can...

18:48.861 --> 18:50.930
you can solve this while making

18:50.930 --> 18:52.165
your company money.

18:52.165 --> 18:53.400
Remember Henry Ford?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.601
Remember Henry Ford?

18:54.601 --> 18:55.568
He was wrong about a lot of

18:55.568 --> 18:56.669
things, but he was right

18:56.669 --> 18:57.337
about this.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.739
Paying people fair wages and

18:59.739 --> 19:01.708
giving workers time to spend

19:01.708 --> 19:03.943
those wages leads to a more

19:03.943 --> 19:05.412
prosperous nation.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.846
That's just as true today as

19:06.846 --> 19:08.581
it was in 1926.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.250
Also, the Jewish conspiracy--

19:10.250 --> 19:11.551
No, no, cut it, enough.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.919
Out, out, out!

19:12.919 --> 19:13.786
Great.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.355
All you have to do is remember

19:15.355 --> 19:17.390
that your company profits when

19:17.390 --> 19:18.891
your employees are well cared

19:18.891 --> 19:19.559
for.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.793
Here, remember Bob and Ryan?

19:20.793 --> 19:22.429
My philosophy as CEO is that

19:22.429 --> 19:23.896
we need to take care of our team

19:23.896 --> 19:24.897
first.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.299
Treating people well really is

19:26.299 --> 19:27.934
the best way to do business.

19:27.934 --> 19:28.968
And paying employees low

19:28.968 --> 19:30.270
wages and overworking them is

19:30.270 --> 19:32.104
bad for capitalism as a whole.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.606
Because if people don't have

19:33.606 --> 19:35.408
time and money to buy things,

19:35.408 --> 19:36.643
the economy would grind to a

19:36.643 --> 19:37.544
halt.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.979
The only way to build a stable,

19:39.979 --> 19:42.382
strong economy is making sure

19:42.382 --> 19:44.150
the average worker has cash

19:44.150 --> 19:46.253
and free time.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.555
Right on, Bob.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.589
So, you're telling me if I

19:49.589 --> 19:51.224
treat my employees well,

19:51.224 --> 19:52.559
I'll make more money in the

19:52.559 --> 19:53.226
long term?

19:53.226 --> 19:54.327
Yeah, and look.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.895
I know change is hard, but

19:55.895 --> 19:56.963
that's way they pay you the

19:56.963 --> 19:58.398
big boy boss bucks, right?

19:58.398 --> 19:59.098
(ka-ching)

19:59.098 --> 20:00.267
Yeah.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.068
I guess I could scrounge up some

20:02.068 --> 20:03.936
money and pay the interns a

20:03.936 --> 20:04.637
little bit.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.405
Yeah.

20:05.405 --> 20:09.141
Maybe hire Eric full time?

20:09.141 --> 20:10.443
Put up a spreadsheet with all

20:10.443 --> 20:11.811
of our salaries?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.079
In the summertime, Friday

20:13.079 --> 20:16.249
afternoons, everyone gets off.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.149
(sighs) I might even be

20:17.149 --> 20:18.585
interviewed by NPR, 'cause I

20:18.585 --> 20:19.586
shake things up!

20:19.586 --> 20:20.687
Now, you're talking!

20:20.687 --> 20:22.088
And if you do all those

20:22.088 --> 20:22.755
things...

20:22.755 --> 20:24.524
I'll be a good boss.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.093
Hashtag, #GreatBoss.

20:28.695 --> 20:30.963
So, Mr. Harris, you want us

20:30.963 --> 20:33.199
to start paying the interns,

20:33.199 --> 20:34.434
give our employees more power in

20:34.434 --> 20:36.603
negotiations, and the entire

20:36.603 --> 20:40.273
staff Fridays off?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.274
Yes, because you see,

20:41.274 --> 20:44.076
ma'am...

20:47.113 --> 20:49.449
This will actually lead to more

20:49.449 --> 20:51.117
profit.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.652
No.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.220
However, we will be fulfilling

20:54.220 --> 20:56.623
your request for more darts.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.727
Yes!

21:00.727 --> 21:01.861
We did it!

21:01.861 --> 21:03.630
(laughing)

21:03.630 --> 21:04.096
