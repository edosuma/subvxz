WEBVTT

00:00.166 --> 00:04.623
It was taken back in 2006, when
Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me

00:04.633 --> 00:06.123
and we all went out to brunch.

00:06.133 --> 00:07.994
We all look pretty
happy, right?

00:08.239 --> 00:09.299
Wrong.

00:09.309 --> 00:10.663
I wish your face
would melt off.

00:10.673 --> 00:11.943
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

00:11.973 --> 00:14.417
- I hate you.
- I hate you more.

00:14.427 --> 00:16.621
- I'm going to kill him.
- I can't say I blame you.

00:16.631 --> 00:18.921
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.340
I don't care how unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.

00:21.352 --> 00:23.269
- Not now.
- Okay, if you don't, I will.

00:23.277 --> 00:24.483
Robin...

00:25.156 --> 00:27.843
Okay, for any of this to make sense,
you got to understand,

00:27.857 --> 00:29.710
there are three
parts to this story.

00:29.728 --> 00:32.150
Let's start with the
Marshall and Lily part.

00:34.036 --> 00:38.270
As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown
my parents to New York for the weekend.

00:38.287 --> 00:40.371
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your cousin Jimmy

00:40.385 --> 00:42.942
had a wonderful time at
that spa he visited.

00:42.958 --> 00:46.190
You mean the spa the judge ordered
him to go to to quit cocaine?

00:46.317 --> 00:47.710
Coffee?

00:48.015 --> 00:50.802
Now, Grandma and Grandpa didn't
like to talk about things

00:50.818 --> 00:52.863
that were
uncomfortable, emotional,

00:52.876 --> 00:54.872
or in any way... real.

00:54.886 --> 00:56.782
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.

00:56.795 --> 00:58.792
Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.

00:58.808 --> 00:59.732
Good to see you.

00:59.746 --> 01:02.442
I was just stopping by to
pick up some of my things.

01:02.458 --> 01:05.753
Yes, we were so sorry
to hear about your...

01:05.778 --> 01:07.990
you know, the, the...

01:10.256 --> 01:11.251
Well...

01:11.266 --> 01:13.300
Lily calling off the
wedding and dumping me?

01:13.318 --> 01:16.333
Me begging Marshall to take
me back and him rejecting me?

01:16.346 --> 01:18.192
I love your hair.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074

01:32.578 --> 01:34.680
This was only the second
time Marshall and Lily

01:34.698 --> 01:36.592
had seen each other
since breaking up,

01:36.606 --> 01:38.950
but to their credit,
it wasn't that awkward.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.420
Actually, we're cool.

01:40.435 --> 01:43.490
We just divided up CDs.
It was all very civil.

01:43.507 --> 01:45.202
I'm proud of us;
we're, we're good.

01:45.218 --> 01:48.680
Well, we were all going to
go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.

01:48.697 --> 01:50.952
Lily, would you
like to join us?

01:50.965 --> 01:52.781
Um...

01:52.795 --> 01:54.043
What?

01:54.057 --> 01:58.363
Well, I-I don't want to go if it
would make you uncomfortable.

01:58.378 --> 01:59.760
Why would it?

01:59.775 --> 02:02.663
Well, I mean, yeah, we're...
we're good,

02:02.675 --> 02:07.031
but you got to admit there's
that stuff between us.

02:07.045 --> 02:08.872
Um, not for me.

02:08.887 --> 02:11.123
Now it's just like
we're friends.

02:11.135 --> 02:14.171
It's like we're
brother and sister.

02:15.368 --> 02:17.960
"Brother and sister"?!

02:18.356 --> 02:22.492
Okay. Fine, yeah,
I'll see you at the restaurant, bro.

02:25.075 --> 02:27.703
See? Not awkward at all.

02:27.986 --> 02:29.620
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

02:29.635 --> 02:31.143
Hello, Marshall.

02:31.157 --> 02:33.403
Lily, that is a stunning dress.

02:33.416 --> 02:35.332
Oh, thanks.

02:35.347 --> 02:37.460
It's kind of revealing,
but I thought,

02:37.476 --> 02:40.823
"Hey, we're all
family." Right, bro?

02:42.356 --> 02:43.322
What's wrong?

02:43.336 --> 02:46.662
Oh, I,
I hurt my ankle in yoga today.

02:46.675 --> 02:49.112
The instructor told me to
just take deep breaths

02:49.127 --> 02:51.413
to get through
the pain, just...

02:58.115 --> 03:01.503
Are you all right?
You're kind of sweating.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.650
No, I'm fine. It's just...

03:03.668 --> 03:06.553
this roll is really spicy.

03:06.947 --> 03:08.782
Lily is evil!

03:08.796 --> 03:10.962
She just wore that
dress to torture me.

03:10.977 --> 03:13.041
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.

03:13.057 --> 03:16.203
See, at brunch,
I'm going to torture Lily right back.

03:16.218 --> 03:19.383
Yeah. There's a part of my body
that she's got a weakness for, too.

03:19.395 --> 03:22.121
Dude, you can't whip
that out at brunch.

03:22.777 --> 03:24.402
No, not that.

03:24.758 --> 03:28.471
I'm going to unleash my calves.

03:29.016 --> 03:30.691
That's crazy.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.792
Nobody's turned on
by men's calves.

03:32.805 --> 03:35.303
They're a thoroughly
unerotic body part.

03:35.318 --> 03:39.372
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I
had those skinny little chicken legs.

03:40.937 --> 03:43.763
I'll be waiting by the
phone for your apology.

03:45.155 --> 03:47.702
So Marshall showed up
at brunch with a plan.

03:47.718 --> 03:49.140
-  Hello.
- Oh, hi.

03:49.175 --> 03:50.521
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey.

03:50.538 --> 03:52.282
Hey. How are you feeling?

03:52.296 --> 03:54.552
You looked kind of
feverish last night.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.703
Oh, no, I actually feel great.

03:57.417 --> 04:00.061
It is kind of warm in here,
though, isn't it?

04:00.075 --> 04:02.653
Oh, I don't know,
if anything, it's kind of...

04:02.666 --> 04:03.642
What are you doing?

04:03.658 --> 04:05.490
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

04:05.506 --> 04:09.440
I'm just making myself feel a
little bit more... comfortable.

04:14.016 --> 04:15.440
Oh.

04:15.987 --> 04:17.891
Oh, yes.

04:18.088 --> 04:21.493
I've been doing all these
toe lifts lately, and so...

04:21.546 --> 04:24.752
my calves have really
been cramping up.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.530
Take off your dress.

04:35.546 --> 04:37.860
Take off the rest
of your pants.

04:39.688 --> 04:41.411
I really wasn't
expecting that to happen.

04:41.426 --> 04:43.493
Yeah, me neither. It kind of
complicates things, doesn't it?

04:43.525 --> 04:47.643
Yeah, it does. Why did you have to
throw your magnificent calves at me?

04:47.656 --> 04:49.210
You know you have
a punter's leg.

04:49.226 --> 04:51.650
Well, why did you have to throw
your beautiful boobs at me?

04:51.668 --> 04:54.252
You know you have... boobs.

04:54.666 --> 04:57.950
Just admit it,
you came here trying to seduce me.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.923
Seduce you? You seduced me.

04:59.938 --> 05:02.871
You sat down next to me and
took most of your pants off.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.131
You went to San Francisco
for three months.

05:05.146 --> 05:06.570
How is that seducing you?

05:06.586 --> 05:08.133
Well, it's not but I'm
still mad about it.

05:08.168 --> 05:10.620
All right, that's it--
I want The Beatles Anthology.

05:10.638 --> 05:11.962
Oh, well, that's too bad;
I'm keeping it.

05:11.996 --> 05:14.042
And you know the U2
box set I gave you?

05:14.058 --> 05:16.100
Look inside--
all Dave Matthews.

05:16.118 --> 05:17.510
You are evil.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.201
Smile.

05:21.247 --> 05:22.350
I'm going to kill him.

05:22.366 --> 05:23.670
I can't say I blame you.

05:23.686 --> 05:26.693
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

05:27.725 --> 05:30.943
Now let's talk about the
Barney part of the story.

05:32.118 --> 05:34.841
This was going to be Robin's
first time meeting my parents,

05:34.858 --> 05:37.163
so we were both
a little nervous.

05:38.106 --> 05:40.061
Barney, what are
you doing here?

05:40.076 --> 05:42.070
Uh... I'm here to
meet your parents.

05:42.085 --> 05:43.351
They must be dying
to meet me after all

05:43.385 --> 05:45.301
the legendary Barney
stories you've told them.

05:45.316 --> 05:47.212
I haven't told them any
legendary Barney stories.

05:47.248 --> 05:48.133
What?

05:48.147 --> 05:53.041
Barney,  here is a list of all the things
I talk with my dad about: baseball.

05:55.318 --> 05:56.700
But I'm your best friend.

05:56.715 --> 05:57.791
Well,  actually Marshall's my...

05:57.825 --> 05:59.623
I'm the most important
person in your life.

05:59.636 --> 06:00.682
Well, Robin's actually...

06:00.695 --> 06:03.051
How could your parents
not know about me?

06:03.067 --> 06:04.411
I'm delightful.

06:04.428 --> 06:08.662
To us, sure, in very small,
infrequent doses.

06:08.675 --> 06:10.502
I mean, come on,
you're not exactly the kind of friend

06:10.538 --> 06:12.300
parents want their kid to have.

06:12.316 --> 06:13.863
Oh, really?

06:13.878 --> 06:16.110
Then I guess those
shoes aren't the thing

06:16.125 --> 06:18.450
you're most wrong about today.

06:22.258 --> 06:23.932
- Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
- Ted.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.640
I know you've all been
excited to meet...

06:25.658 --> 06:29.662
Barney Stinson.
An honor to meet the two of you.

06:29.678 --> 06:32.092
That needlepoint "Bless This
Mess" pillow you made for Ted--

06:32.102 --> 06:33.439
what a stitch.

06:33.447 --> 06:35.603
Stitch! Did that just happen?

06:37.246 --> 06:39.383
Uh, Mom, Dad,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

06:39.395 --> 06:40.413
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:40.426 --> 06:42.372
Oh, it's wonderful
to meet you, Robin.

06:42.387 --> 06:45.391
Oh, you are so pretty.
Isn't she pretty, Al?

06:45.406 --> 06:46.473
A real looker.

06:46.485 --> 06:49.790
That's funny, I didn't even
"look" in the mirror today.

06:51.725 --> 06:54.212
That's not anything, is it?

06:54.305 --> 06:58.921
So, I made a reservation at
San Marino tonight for 8:00.

06:58.935 --> 07:01.161
San Marino.

07:01.176 --> 07:02.862
Oh, you're serious? Yikes.

07:02.878 --> 07:05.311
No. We have to
try Casa A Pezzi.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.513
Best salmon risotto
I have ever had.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.740
I love salmon risotto.

07:09.755 --> 07:11.521
I know.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.251
How are we supposed to get
a table at Casa A Pezzi?

07:14.268 --> 07:15.572
They're booked for weeks.

07:15.588 --> 07:18.350
Well, lucky for you,
I happen to know the head waitress,

07:18.365 --> 07:20.782
which is ironic because...

07:21.877 --> 07:26.722
Ironic because we both work at a
homeless shelter where I serve the food.

07:26.736 --> 07:29.150
Where do you volunteer, Robin?

07:30.208 --> 07:31.790
What's the matter with you?

07:31.807 --> 07:34.352
I'm his girlfriend,
and I'm not even trying that hard.

07:34.365 --> 07:36.403
Way to wreck the
curve, kiss-ass.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.261
Robin, I'm his best friend.

07:38.275 --> 07:39.511
That's a commitment.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.183
Girlfriend, that's
like a bad flu.

07:42.196 --> 07:44.280
Out of your system after
a couple weeks in bed.

07:44.295 --> 07:45.821
High five.

07:46.347 --> 07:47.583
Can I help?

07:47.596 --> 07:49.190
Yes, you can, Virginia.

07:49.206 --> 07:53.020
There's a story behind that broach,
and I'm going to hear it.

07:53.036 --> 07:54.780
Well, funny you should ask.

07:58.638 --> 08:01.470
Whoa! Bravo, Barney.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.983
That is my all-time
favorite sonata.

08:04.995 --> 08:06.723
Barney, you are
just delightful.

08:06.737 --> 08:10.041
No, Virginia, you're delightful,
I am deligh-ted.

08:10.058 --> 08:11.350
And he's just Ted.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.521
I'm really not planning these things;
they just keep happening.

08:15.018 --> 08:17.942
Whoops. I think I dropped
an ice cube down here.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.652
Ow, it's so cold.

08:20.106 --> 08:22.232
All right, that's it,
I'm out of here.

08:24.535 --> 08:25.771
In a minute.

08:26.347 --> 08:28.321
Anyone up for a
drink at MacLaren's?

08:28.338 --> 08:29.813
- No, I'm kind of tired.
- Me, too.

08:29.827 --> 08:31.053
Yeah, I'm sure my
folks are gonna want...

08:31.086 --> 08:33.982
I feel like I could knock
back a few cervezas.

08:33.998 --> 08:35.861
Cervezas?

08:35.878 --> 08:37.600
Did he fall?

08:37.616 --> 08:41.530
I'd join you, too, but I want to
get up early for Mass tomorrow.

08:41.547 --> 08:45.151
St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m.,
it's my favorite service.

08:45.166 --> 08:49.282
Wait a minute-- you're able to
cross the threshold of a church?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.561
I'll save you a seat.

08:50.577 --> 08:53.243
Oh, you are just terrific.

08:53.255 --> 08:55.310
Isn't he, Susan?

08:55.666 --> 08:56.952
Robin.

08:56.968 --> 08:59.773
Susan, her name is Virginia.

09:02.955 --> 09:05.331
Dude, I am sincerely ticked
at your dad right now.

09:05.347 --> 09:06.602
Why?

09:06.617 --> 09:09.340
Last night,
we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?

09:09.355 --> 09:11.872
So Barney darts back
into the burning house,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.000
lifts up the refrigerator
I'm pinned under

09:14.018 --> 09:16.111
and pulls me to safety.

09:16.405 --> 09:18.443
Whoa. You're like a hero.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.632
Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.602
You know who is a hero?

09:22.616 --> 09:25.260
My Dalmatian, Smokey.

09:25.397 --> 09:29.893
He... didn't... make it out.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.511
I'm sorry.

09:34.505 --> 09:36.571
You poor, brave man.

09:36.587 --> 09:38.853
Why don't you give
the guy a hug?

09:38.865 --> 09:40.871
I'm... oh.

09:44.776 --> 09:47.360
My dad was your wingman?

09:47.375 --> 09:48.931
This is really
messing with my head.

09:48.945 --> 09:51.851
Barney, is my dad cool?

09:51.867 --> 09:53.493
I'm not done.

09:53.656 --> 09:55.992
So, your dad stays
to finish his drink,

09:56.008 --> 09:59.132
but I take off because I have to be
up early for Mass with your mom.

09:59.148 --> 10:00.453
Sure.

10:00.468 --> 10:04.922
Anyway, I realize that I left my
phone on the bar, so I come back...

10:08.577 --> 10:10.331
Oh, my God...

10:15.075 --> 10:16.661
Oh, my God.

10:16.836 --> 10:18.581
Is that really...

10:19.486 --> 10:22.190
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

10:22.308 --> 10:25.731
Can you believe your dad
rack-jacked me like that?

10:31.227 --> 10:34.201
My dad made out with
Wendy the waitress?

10:34.215 --> 10:36.811
He cheated on my mom?
No, that's impossible.

10:36.826 --> 10:39.820
Ted, it's a well-known
statistic that 83% of people

10:39.835 --> 10:42.701
married longer than six months
are seeing someone on the side.

10:42.718 --> 10:46.512
Do you know that when you make up
a statistic, you always use "83%"?

10:46.778 --> 10:48.221
You think I'm lying.

10:48.235 --> 10:50.301
Well, have you done any
surveys on the subject?

10:50.316 --> 10:54.261
Because  the good people at
www.swingers.open-marriage-is natural\

10:54.276 --> 10:57.910
legalize-polygamy.org have,
and they beg to differ.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.323
That's not a real Web site.

10:59.336 --> 11:03.292
Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real
T-shirt for running in their 10K.

11:06.837 --> 11:09.590
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Ted. Barney.

11:09.606 --> 11:12.092
- Enjoying your vacation so far?
- Oh, yeah.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.300
Uh, listen,
can I speak to you outside for a sec?

11:14.317 --> 11:15.662
Sure.

11:19.558 --> 11:21.403
So you went out with
Barney last night?

11:21.417 --> 11:22.563
Yeah.

11:22.968 --> 11:23.973
You have a good time?

11:23.987 --> 11:26.362
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sorry you couldn't join us.

11:28.416 --> 11:29.862
Yeah.

11:30.657 --> 11:31.960
So...

11:32.806 --> 11:34.092
What?

11:34.537 --> 11:35.940
Well...

11:37.176 --> 11:38.500
Well what?

11:40.258 --> 11:43.712
You think Cerrano's got
a shot at the RBI title?

11:44.687 --> 11:46.962
I wanted to confront him,
but I couldn't.

11:46.978 --> 11:50.202
I guess I got the let's-not-talk-
about-anything-uncomfortable gene

11:50.218 --> 11:52.840
Well, you didn't get your dad's
close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.330
Smile.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.763
Great.

11:55.778 --> 11:59.220
I don't care how unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.

11:59.235 --> 12:00.441
Not now.

12:00.457 --> 12:02.223
Okay, if you don't, I will.

12:02.238 --> 12:03.542
Robin...!

12:04.288 --> 12:07.092
Okay, now I got to back up
all the way to the beginning

12:07.105 --> 12:10.001
to tell you the me and
Robin part of the story.

12:11.077 --> 12:13.831
We were expecting my
parents at any minute.

12:13.847 --> 12:15.490
One last thing about my mom.

12:15.505 --> 12:17.140
She grills every single
one of my girlfriends

12:17.176 --> 12:19.471
about when we're gonna
get married and have kids.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.102
But this is the first
time she's meeting me.

12:21.135 --> 12:21.812
Doesn't matter.

12:21.826 --> 12:24.300
And you'll know it's coming when
she mentions my cousin Stacy--

12:24.336 --> 12:26.120
six  kids in five years.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.992
The woman's basically
a ride at a water park.

12:29.607 --> 12:32.372
But I don't want to get
married and have kids.

12:32.386 --> 12:33.913
What am I supposed to say?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.253
You know what?

12:35.268 --> 12:37.920
You're an adult with
perfectly valid opinions.

12:37.938 --> 12:39.421
You shouldn't have to
apologize for them.

12:39.457 --> 12:41.570
- I'm gonna lie.
- I would.

12:42.536 --> 12:45.800
Thanks again for letting
me have the U2 box set.

12:45.817 --> 12:48.113
I know how important
it is to you.

12:48.175 --> 12:50.581
I talked to Aunt
Caroline the other day.

12:50.597 --> 12:52.770
Stacy's pregnant again.

12:52.786 --> 12:55.110
Oh, good for her.

12:55.127 --> 12:57.192
- So, dear...
- Oh, boy.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.910
Tell us what it's like
being a journalist.

12:58.925 --> 13:00.650
I'm just not ready.

13:00.666 --> 13:03.070
Okay. No pressure.

13:03.097 --> 13:06.332
Oh. Uh, I thought you, um...

13:06.378 --> 13:07.822
It's great.

13:07.836 --> 13:08.762
Good.

13:08.776 --> 13:12.170
Focus on your job now,
because your career clock is ticking.

13:12.186 --> 13:16.140
There's time for marriage and kids
and all that other stuff later.

13:17.577 --> 13:19.621
Ooh, a piano!

13:21.337 --> 13:23.421
You lucked out with my
mom last night, huh?

13:23.435 --> 13:24.521
What a relief, right?

13:24.536 --> 13:25.733
Oh, absolutely.

13:25.748 --> 13:27.860
Whew, what a relief it is to
know I'm the one girlfriend

13:27.895 --> 13:30.312
your mom doesn't want
you to have kids with.

13:30.568 --> 13:32.200
Hooray?

13:32.507 --> 13:35.363
I mean, did she really think that
your college girlfriend Cheryl

13:35.378 --> 13:37.182
would pop out
attractive children?

13:37.195 --> 13:39.303
'Cause I've seen pictures,
and, I'm sorry,

13:39.316 --> 13:42.112
that girl had a brow
ridge like a caveman.

13:42.126 --> 13:44.862
Come on, she was just
frowning under direct light.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.592
And besides, that's not even what
I liked about her. It was her...

13:47.827 --> 13:49.493
It's not important.

13:51.246 --> 13:53.192
What happened to
Marshall and Lily?

13:53.205 --> 13:54.653
They've been fighting lately.

13:54.666 --> 13:56.790
They're probably off
somewhere going at it.

13:56.806 --> 13:58.010
More coffee?

13:58.028 --> 14:00.103
Oh, no, thank you.

14:00.865 --> 14:03.103
Isn't she sweet?

14:03.116 --> 14:06.730
Well, if she's so sweet,
maybe she should have Ted's babies.

14:06.958 --> 14:08.580
Excuse me?

14:08.596 --> 14:10.132
Nothing.

14:15.538 --> 14:16.803
Just a minute.

14:16.817 --> 14:18.581
Maybe less.

14:18.618 --> 14:21.952
Robin, dear.
Did I say something to upset you?

14:21.968 --> 14:24.462
Why don't you want me
to have your grandkids?

14:24.748 --> 14:26.712
Do you want to
have my grandkids?

14:26.728 --> 14:29.791
No! I mean, I don't know.

14:29.808 --> 14:33.220
I just... I want you to want me
to want to have your grandkids.

14:33.235 --> 14:35.991
And you should.
I'm a genetic gold mine.

14:36.007 --> 14:38.733
No family history of
diabetes or heart disease.

14:38.746 --> 14:42.072
Everyone has nonporous
teeth and perfect eyesight.

14:42.086 --> 14:46.363
I had one schizophrenic uncle,
but even he had perfect vision.

14:46.376 --> 14:48.312
Which was unfortunate

14:48.328 --> 14:50.932
for the people around
the bell tower he was in,

14:50.947 --> 14:53.113
but still he was a
very fine man, and...

14:53.128 --> 14:56.091
Excuse me. Sorry.
Didn't know that there was a line.

14:56.155 --> 14:58.020
Marshall, your zipper.

15:05.968 --> 15:08.970
Robin, it's not that I
don't want grandkids.

15:08.985 --> 15:11.143
It's just I don't think anyone
should make the mistake

15:11.158 --> 15:13.150
of getting married too young.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.190
Why do you say that?

15:14.207 --> 15:17.763
I mean, you got married pretty young.
That wasn't a mistake.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.471
Was it?

15:20.485 --> 15:21.973
Well...

15:22.038 --> 15:24.120
Okay, there's something
you don't know.

15:24.138 --> 15:25.823
Smile.

15:26.206 --> 15:27.580
I wish your face
would melt off.

15:27.598 --> 15:29.162
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

15:29.175 --> 15:30.012
I'm gonna kill him.

15:30.027 --> 15:32.282
I don't care how unpleasant it is,
you have to talk to him.

15:32.315 --> 15:34.423
- Not now.
- Okay, if you don't, I will.

15:34.438 --> 15:35.591
Robin...!

15:36.687 --> 15:39.550
Oh, gosh, let me help you
pick those up, sweetheart.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.740
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?!

15:41.755 --> 15:43.421
The only sweetheart in your
life should be the woman

15:43.455 --> 15:45.861
you married 30 years ago,
not the waitress at the bar last night

15:45.897 --> 15:48.241
and not this clumsy floozy!

15:48.258 --> 15:49.741
I'm sorry, you're not a floozy.

15:49.755 --> 15:52.102
I'm upset,
I don't know what I'm saying.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.651
But stay away from my dad.

15:54.946 --> 15:57.550
Ted, what are you
talking about?

15:57.586 --> 15:58.940
Dad?

15:58.955 --> 16:03.531
You, uh, want to tell Mom what
happened at the bar last night?

16:05.335 --> 16:07.052
Okay.

16:07.068 --> 16:09.432
I hooked up with a waitress.

16:09.895 --> 16:11.373
Oh.

16:12.158 --> 16:13.542
O h?

16:13.558 --> 16:15.421
I mean, oh!

16:15.435 --> 16:17.701
Oh! Ooh!

16:17.717 --> 16:20.963
We're going to have a serious talk
about this when we get home, Al.

16:20.978 --> 16:23.011
Oh, ooh!

16:23.275 --> 16:25.441
Serious talk? Mom, what...?

16:25.458 --> 16:27.910
He was kissing another woman.
Don't you care?

16:27.928 --> 16:29.843
Mrs. Mosby?

16:31.926 --> 16:34.903
Ted, we weren't quite sure
how to tell you this...

16:34.917 --> 16:37.653
Your mother and I are divorced.

16:42.808 --> 16:45.570
What do you mean you're divorced?
Since when?

16:45.585 --> 16:48.160
Oh, gosh,
it's been about nine months now.

16:48.178 --> 16:49.571
Closer to ten, I think.

16:49.588 --> 16:51.460
Time flies.

16:51.475 --> 16:54.091
So ten months ago,
you just up and decided

16:54.106 --> 16:55.892
to get divorced
without telling me?

16:55.908 --> 16:57.562
No, it wasn't a snap decision.

16:57.576 --> 17:00.080
We'd been separated
almost two years.

17:00.097 --> 17:02.062
How could you not
tell me this?!

17:02.078 --> 17:05.411
We meant to, it just never
seemed like the right time.

17:05.428 --> 17:07.380
So last Christmas...?

17:07.397 --> 17:09.282
We talked about
telling you kids then,

17:09.295 --> 17:11.560
but it didn't seem
very Christmasy.

17:12.537 --> 17:14.281
I got you a tandem bike.

17:14.297 --> 17:17.583
Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother
and Frank ride it all the time.

17:17.596 --> 17:19.031
Who the hell is Frank?!

17:19.045 --> 17:22.542
Oh, great guy.
I actually set them up.

17:22.555 --> 17:25.893
You remember Dr. Muchnik.
He did your braces.

17:28.705 --> 17:30.771
Okay, my head's
about to explode,

17:30.785 --> 17:32.881
and I don't want to get it
all over everyone's waffles,

17:32.918 --> 17:34.401
so I am leaving.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.423
Teddy bear, oh...

17:40.488 --> 17:43.422
You know,
he mentioned he was divorced last night.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.200
I totally spaced on that.

17:46.776 --> 17:49.160
Ooh, no line at
the omelet station.

17:55.347 --> 17:56.891
Lily...

17:57.295 --> 18:00.031
I'm sorry that I said
all those things.

18:00.087 --> 18:01.753
Me, too.

18:03.067 --> 18:06.163
I just find it really confusing
to be around you right now.

18:06.178 --> 18:07.882
It's the same for me.

18:08.848 --> 18:10.950
I think we're probably
both better off trying

18:10.968 --> 18:13.683
to keep some distance
for a while.

18:13.765 --> 18:15.732
Yeah, I think you're right.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.822
Are you wearing a push-up bra?

18:24.835 --> 18:26.302
Did you Mystic Tan your calves?

18:26.316 --> 18:28.242
I withdraw the question.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.863
We're sorry we didn't say
anything about the divorce.

18:32.876 --> 18:35.313
It was wrong not to tell you.

18:35.328 --> 18:36.761
Thank you.

18:36.775 --> 18:38.243
But listen,
don't tell your sister.

18:38.255 --> 18:40.181
It would just upset her.

18:40.547 --> 18:42.431
No, this is ridiculous!

18:42.448 --> 18:45.793
We have to start talking about stuff,
and not just baseball.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.810
Indians won today on
a walk-off double.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.202
Against the Red Sox?
Boy, that's a big win.

18:50.216 --> 18:53.140
No. No. No.
We're not gonna blow past this.

18:53.158 --> 18:55.152
I mean,
I don't even know who you people.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.343
I don't even know how you met.

18:57.355 --> 18:59.043
I never told you how
I met your mother?

18:59.058 --> 19:00.882
- No.
- Oh, great story.

19:00.897 --> 19:02.423
At a bar.

19:04.285 --> 19:05.651
That's it?

19:05.668 --> 19:08.650
That's what passes for
communication in our family?

19:08.668 --> 19:11.370
Man, when I have kids,
and I tell them how I met their mother,

19:11.385 --> 19:14.523
I'm gonna tell them everything,
the whole damn story.

19:15.546 --> 19:17.731
I think it was an Irish bar.

19:19.535 --> 19:21.801
I just, I don't...
I don't understand.

19:21.817 --> 19:23.521
You seemed so happy.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.882
When I was growing up,
you seemed so...

19:25.957 --> 19:27.552
What happened?

19:27.626 --> 19:30.133
We just realized we're
very different people.

19:30.147 --> 19:32.533
Your father's kind of a
head-in-the-clouds romantic,

19:32.548 --> 19:34.970
and I'm much more
down to earth.

19:34.985 --> 19:36.151
So?

19:36.166 --> 19:38.902
Robin and I are like that.
That doesn't mean anything.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.712
I wanted kids.
And your mother...

19:42.156 --> 19:44.591
also wanted kids.

19:45.447 --> 19:47.521
Robin and I have different
views on families.

19:47.535 --> 19:49.261
We're not about to
break up because of it.

19:49.278 --> 19:52.221
On some level, I always knew.

19:52.238 --> 19:54.483
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the beginning.

19:54.496 --> 19:58.481
But he spent months badgering
me until I finally gave in.

19:59.357 --> 20:03.651
Well, when you don't connect on
that many fundamental levels,

20:03.666 --> 20:07.581
it's only a matter of time before you
realize you're not meant to be together.

20:08.865 --> 20:10.871
But we love Robin.

20:10.885 --> 20:11.873
Absolutely.

20:11.888 --> 20:14.002
Meeting you was the
highlight of my trip.

20:14.017 --> 20:16.383
Well, second highlight.

20:17.288 --> 20:20.172
- We'll see you inside.
- Sorry.

20:25.045 --> 20:26.481
Wow.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.092
I know.

20:28.986 --> 20:31.501
They love me!

20:34.345 --> 20:37.671
So we are definitely going
to try and communicate more.

20:37.687 --> 20:39.452
From now on, full disclosure.
