18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
YOU KNOW HOW TO USE THIS THING?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.041
[gun clicks]

18:38.041 --> 18:39.667
- OF COURSE I KNOW
HOW TO USE IT.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.000
- OH, MY GOD.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.834
[speaking native language]

18:44.834 --> 18:46.834
- THANKS.
APPRECIATE IT.

18:50.417 --> 18:52.250
- WHAT DID HE SAY?

18:52.250 --> 18:54.625
- AT THIS POINT,
ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS

18:54.625 --> 18:56.042
NEED TO BE PRIVILEGED.

18:56.042 --> 18:57.083
- WHAT?

18:57.083 --> 18:58.500
- I NEED TO TALK
TO FIONA ALONE.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.333
- I HAVE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
ANYWAY.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.000
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.625
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
- OKAY.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.333
- WALK WITH ME.
I GOTTA BE AT COOK COUNTY

19:05.333 --> 19:06.625
IN 20 MINUTES.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.250
I ASKED MR. JEFFREYS

19:08.250 --> 19:10.667
IF HE'D AGREE
TO THREE YEARS PROBATION.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.375
- WOW.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.667
- NO PROMISES.
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.166
YOU'D HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.166
THAT MEANS YOU'LL HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.166
- BUT NO JAIL TIME?

19:19.166 --> 19:21.084
- VERY LITTLE IF ANY.

19:21.084 --> 19:22.333
- HOW VERY LITTLE?

19:22.333 --> 19:24.959
- 60 DAYS?
90 TOPS?

19:24.959 --> 19:26.417
- WAIT, SO I GET PROBATION,

19:26.417 --> 19:29.250
BUT I STILL HAVE TO GO TO JAIL
FOR THREE MONTHS?

19:29.250 --> 19:30.834
- IT'S ONLY FOR A FRACTION
OF THE TIME

19:30.834 --> 19:32.209
THEY'RE ASKING FOR.

19:32.209 --> 19:33.917
- I CAN'T GO BACK TO JAIL.

19:33.917 --> 19:36.667
- WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT
AND SEE WHAT HE PROPOSES?

19:36.667 --> 19:38.708
- CAN WE GO TO TRIAL?

19:38.708 --> 19:41.250
- FIONA, I DO THIS EVERY DAY.
I'M TELLING YOU.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.417
WE HAVE A GREAT ARGUMENT
FOR PROBATION.

19:43.417 --> 19:45.125
YOU'RE A FIRST TIME OFFENDER,

19:45.125 --> 19:46.667
AND YOU CALLED THE PARAMEDICS.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.042
D.A. DOESN'T WANT
YOU CLOGGING UP THE JAIL

19:49.042 --> 19:50.625
OR THIS CASE GUMMING UP
THE SYSTEM,

19:50.625 --> 19:53.209
TAKING THEM AWAY
FROM REAL CRIMINAL CASES.

19:53.209 --> 19:55.500
BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH LIAM
WAS HORRIFIC.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.667
A JURY IS GONNA HATE YOU.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.000
I CAN NEGOTIATE THE HELL
OUT OF THIS.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.333
- I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL
AT ALL.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.667
- WELL, WE DON'T GET EVERYTHING
WE WANT.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.041
AND A GOOD NEGOTIATION
IS WHEN BOTH SIDES

20:08.041 --> 20:10.167
FEEL LIKE THEY GOT SCREWED.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.125
- THE THIRD LAW
OF THERMODYNAMICS

20:14.125 --> 20:16.167
SIMPLY STATED IS

20:16.167 --> 20:18.708
THE ENTROPY OF A PERFECT CRYSTAL
AT ABSOLUTE ZERO...

20:18.708 --> 20:23.000
[cell phone vibrates]
IS EXACTLY EQUAL TO ZERO.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.625
NOW, FROM OUR
EARLIER DISCUSSIONS,

20:24.625 --> 20:27.041
WE KNOW THAT ENTROPY
IS A MEASURE OF WHAT?

20:27.041 --> 20:28.125
all: DISORDER.

20:28.125 --> 20:30.417
- AND A CRYSTAL IS A SOLID

20:30.417 --> 20:33.083
WHOSE ATOMS OR MOLECULES
OR IONS

20:33.083 --> 20:34.959
ARE ARRANGED
IN WHAT KIND OF PATTERN?

20:34.959 --> 20:36.875
all: ORDERED.
- VERY GOOD.

20:36.875 --> 20:40.041
- WE'LL PICK THIS UP TOMORROW.
DON'T FORGET.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.375
ASSIGNMENTS EMAILED TO ME
BY 5:00 P.M. THIS EVENING.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.125
- HEY, PROFESSOR SACCO.
I'M SORRY.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.166
I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE ABLE

20:47.166 --> 20:48.500
TO GET
MY ASSIGNMENT IN TONIGHT.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.041
I HAD A BIT
OF A FAMILY CRISIS.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.667
- WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL HAVE IT?

20:52.667 --> 20:55.209
- TOMORROW.

20:55.209 --> 20:57.708
- EVERY DAY IT'S LATE, I'M
DOCKING YOU A HALF A GRADE.

20:57.708 --> 20:59.000
COMPRENDE?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.667
- YES. COMPRENDE.
THANK YOU.

21:01.667 --> 21:05.500
- WHAT'S CHICKEN CORDON BLEU?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.625
- NOTHING YOU CAN MAKE
WITH WHAT'S IN MATTY'S KITCHEN.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.041
- WELL, WHAT SHOULD I MAKE HIM
FOR DINNER THEN?

21:09.041 --> 21:10.834
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU GUYS
GET BACK TOGETHER?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.458
- HE HELPED WHEN FIONA
GOT ARRESTED.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.125
- GOOD THING I DIDN'T HIT
ON HIM.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.291
I WAS TOTALLY GONNA.
- OH.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.417
- THIS ALGEBRA CRAP
IS REDIC.

21:18.417 --> 21:20.167
WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT MATH?

21:20.167 --> 21:22.041
WHEN AM I EVER GONNA USE IT?
- PROBABLY ALL THE TIME.

21:22.041 --> 21:24.250
- LET ME JUST COPY YOURS.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.000
- HOW ABOUT SPAGHETTI
AND MEATBALLS?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.625
- ANYTHING WITH BALLS
IN IT IS GOOD.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.291
- OKAY.
- HEY.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.625
- HI.

21:30.625 --> 21:31.834
- WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

21:31.834 --> 21:33.333
- GARY BROKE UP WITH ME

21:33.333 --> 21:35.167
'CAUSE HIS PARENTS DON'T
WANT HIM TO HAVE A BABY.

21:35.167 --> 21:37.500
SO I CUT MYSELF.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.333
- WHAT?
- THEN MY MOTHER FOUND OUT.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.750
- THAT YOU CUT YOURSELF?

21:41.750 --> 21:44.209
- NO, THAT GARY BROKE UP
WITH ME.

21:44.209 --> 21:46.084
SO SHE DRAGGED ME TO HIS HOUSE
THIS MORNING.

21:46.084 --> 21:47.542
BUT HE WAS STILL ASLEEP.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.375
SO MY MOM AND HIS MOM
GOT INTO THIS HUGE FIGHT.

21:50.375 --> 21:52.250
THEN THE COPS CAME.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.959
AND THAT'S HOW COME
I'M LATE FOR SCHOOL.

21:54.959 --> 21:57.041
- BUT WHY'D YOU CUT YOURSELF?

21:57.041 --> 21:58.542
- YEAH.
THAT WAS STUPID.

21:58.542 --> 21:59.750
THE ONE TIME A GUY DUMPED ME,

21:59.750 --> 22:01.250
I JUST MADE MYSELF PUKE.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.667
- THINK GARY WILL GET BACK
TOGETHER WITH YOU?

22:02.667 --> 22:04.708
- HE SAID HE'D THINK ABOUT IT.

22:04.708 --> 22:05.875
- YOU SHOULD TOTALLY HAVE
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

22:05.875 --> 22:07.166
THAT'LL MAKE HIM COME BACK.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.000
WORKED WITH MATTY.
- OKAY, LIKE WHAT?

22:09.000 --> 22:11.084
- MM, YOU COULD TELL HIM
YOUR DOG GOT SICK.

22:11.084 --> 22:12.041
- OR THAT YOU GOT MOLESTED.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.417
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

22:14.417 --> 22:17.458
- GOOD AFTERNOON.
SORRY ABOUT THE WAIT.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.000
HAD TO THROW A STITCH INTO
A PATIENT'S CERVIX

22:19.000 --> 22:21.125
BEFORE HER LITTLE CRITTER
SLIPPED OUT TOO EARLY.

22:21.125 --> 22:22.500
- YIKES.
- BUT WE'RE ALL GOOD.

22:22.500 --> 22:26.125
- AND IT'S TIME TO LOOK
AT YOUR LITTLE CRITTERS.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.458
OKAY.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.250
WHAT, NO KEV?
- WORK.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.625
- HMM.

22:30.625 --> 22:34.417
AND HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING
LATELY?

22:34.417 --> 22:37.250
- BLOATED AND FAT.

22:39.667 --> 22:40.750
SOMETHING WRONG?

22:40.750 --> 22:43.708
- WELL, I HAVE THE TWO.

22:43.708 --> 22:46.208
BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND
THE OTHER.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.542
LET'S SEE.

22:47.542 --> 22:49.250
SOMETIMES THEY HIDE.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.084
- YEAH, WELL, CHECK BEHIND
MY BLADDER

22:51.084 --> 22:52.875
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN PEEING,
LIKE, 50 TIMES A DAY.

22:52.875 --> 22:56.333
- NOW WHERE ARE YOU?

22:56.333 --> 23:00.041
WELL, I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE
A FETAL RESORPTION.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.041
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

23:02.041 --> 23:03.834
- IT HAPPENS WITH MULTIPLES.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.375
WHEN THE FETUS ISN'T STRONG
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE,

23:05.375 --> 23:07.041
THE OTHERS SOMETIMES
ABSORB IT.

23:07.041 --> 23:09.000
- "ABSORB IT"?

23:09.000 --> 23:10.625
AS IN EAT IT?

23:10.625 --> 23:13.917
- MM, NOT EXACTLY.
BUT YES.

23:13.917 --> 23:16.000
- ONE OF MY BABIES IS GONE?

23:16.000 --> 23:20.250
- BUT THE OTHER TWO LOOK
VERY HEALTHY.

23:20.250 --> 23:22.917
- IS IT SOMETHING THAT I DID?

23:22.917 --> 23:24.625
- NOPE, JUST MOTHER NATURE'S WAY

23:24.625 --> 23:26.041
OF SELECTING OUT
THE WEAKER BABY.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.291
- LOOKING FINE.

23:34.291 --> 23:37.417
- FUCK OFF.
- I LIKE 'EM ROUGH.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.917
I'M SCOTT.
YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE?

23:39.917 --> 23:41.333
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO--

23:41.333 --> 23:42.708
YOU SEEN THIS KID?

23:42.708 --> 23:44.291
- OH.
YOU LIKE 'EM SKINNY.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.500
I COULD LOSE 30 POUNDS
IF YOU WANTED.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.083
- 30 POUN--
MAYBE IN YOUR ASS, MAN.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.458
WHERE'S THE MANAGER?

23:52.458 --> 23:54.875
YO.
YOU THE MANAGER?

23:54.875 --> 23:56.250
- WHO'S ASKING?

23:56.250 --> 23:58.000
- SINCE YOU JUST SAW ME
SPEAKING,

23:58.000 --> 23:59.125
I'MA TAKE A WILD STAB
IT WAS ME.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.333
YOU SEEN THIS KID?

24:00.333 --> 24:01.583
HIS NAME IS IAN.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.042
- NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.875
- WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A LOOK AGAIN?

24:04.875 --> 24:06.583
HE USED TO WORK HERE
SO I'M PRETTY SURE YOU HAVE.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.166
- I CAN'T KEEP TRACK
OF EVERY TWINK

24:08.166 --> 24:10.000
WHO COMES AND GOES
IN THIS PLACE, ALL RIGHT?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.458
- OKAY.

24:11.458 --> 24:13.792
THIS TWINK WENT AWOL
A COUPLE DAYS AGO

24:13.792 --> 24:15.291
AFTER YOUR BOUNCER KICKED

24:15.291 --> 24:17.209
HIS BROTHER AND KID SISTER
OUT INTO THE STREET.

24:17.209 --> 24:18.834
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
- LOOK, YOU LITTLE TWEAKER.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.291
YOU THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST
ONE TO COME IN HERE

24:20.291 --> 24:22.041
BOO-HOOING ABOUT
SOME COCKTAIL SLUT

24:22.041 --> 24:23.792
WHO JACKED YOU OFF
IN THE BATHROOM,

24:23.792 --> 24:25.708
TOLD YOU IT WAS TRUE LOVE,
AND THEN DISAPPEARED?

24:25.708 --> 24:27.708
TRUST ME.
YOU'RE NOT.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.417
SO WHY DON'T YOU BUY
YOURSELF A DRINK

24:29.417 --> 24:31.167
AND FALL IN LOVE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE?

24:31.167 --> 24:33.167
- YOU CALLING ME GAY?

24:33.167 --> 24:36.125
- OH. PLEASE, HONEY.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.125
YOU MAKE JUSTIN BIEBER
LOOK STRAIGHT.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.291
[thud]
AAH! OH! AH!

24:40.291 --> 24:44.250
- NOW, I KNOW YOU KNOW
WHERE HE IS, DICK BREATH.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.084
SO YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME,
OR I'M GONNA SHUT THIS

24:46.084 --> 24:47.959
COME-HOLE DOWN
OVER POSSESSION,

24:47.959 --> 24:49.542
INTENT TO SELL,
AND PROSTITUTION.

24:49.542 --> 24:51.125
OKAY?
- HE'S AT OUR OTHER LOCATION.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.083
FAIRY TAIL IN BOYS TOWN.

24:53.083 --> 24:55.333
- THANK YOU.

24:55.333 --> 25:00.000
THAT SO DIFFICULT?
- OW!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.583
- YO, ANYBODY COMING?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.500
- NO, BUT HURRY UP, MAN.
APURATE.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.917
COME ON.

25:06.917 --> 25:09.042
- FROZEN BURGER PATTIES
LOOK GOOD.

25:09.042 --> 25:11.209
- GRINGO, HOW YOU GONNA GET OUT
WITH ALL THAT STUFF

25:11.209 --> 25:12.083
AND NOT GET CAUGHT?

25:12.083 --> 25:14.042
- I'M NOT GOING OUT THE FRONT.

25:14.042 --> 25:15.417
OKAY, TAKE THE TRASH OUT,

25:15.417 --> 25:16.625
PUT THIS ON TOP
OF THE DUMPSTER.

25:16.625 --> 25:18.708
I'LL GRAB IT ON MY WAY HOME.

25:18.708 --> 25:20.084
- YOU'RE NOT AS DUMB
AS YOU LOOK.

25:20.084 --> 25:22.917
YOU KNOW THAT.

25:22.917 --> 25:24.209
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.

25:24.209 --> 25:25.250
GOT THAT?
- GOT IT, GOT IT.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.583
- ALL RIGHT.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.208
- SEE YOU LATER, GRINGO.

25:28.208 --> 25:32.250
HEY.
HOW YOU DOING?

25:32.250 --> 25:35.000
- ...TUMBLR DRINKING BLOGS
THERE ARE OUT THERE?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.500
[chuckles]

25:36.500 --> 25:38.083
I COULD WRITE A BETTER ONE
THAN THESE DOUCHE BAGS.

25:38.083 --> 25:41.708
- WAIT, SO YOUR MOTHER WAS
DATING TWO DIFFERENT GUYS

25:41.708 --> 25:43.917
WHILE YOUR FATHER WAS IN PRISON.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.959
- THAT WE KNEW OF.

25:45.959 --> 25:48.333
"SMOKING A COKE-LACED BOWL
OF WEED

25:48.333 --> 25:50.750
IS THE BEST HIGH EVER"?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.125
AMATEURS.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.458
- WASN'T SHE AFRAID
HE'D FIND OUT?

25:53.458 --> 25:56.167
- HE DID.
GOT AN EARLY RELEASE.

25:56.167 --> 25:58.333
WALKED IN ON HER
SCREWING VAVOO...

25:58.333 --> 26:02.000
SOME BUSBOY SHE BROUGHT HOME
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.041
- OH, MY GOD.

26:03.041 --> 26:04.667
WHAT DID HE DO?

26:04.667 --> 26:06.875
- VAVOO?
HE CRAPPED HIMSELF.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.875
- [laughs]

26:08.875 --> 26:10.792
- MY FATHER DID
WHAT HE ALWAYS DID.

26:10.792 --> 26:13.000
BEAT ON ME.
- WHY YOU?

26:13.000 --> 26:16.084
- IT WAS MY FAULT.
IT WAS ALWAYS MY FAULT.

26:16.084 --> 26:19.083
MY MOM GOT AWAY SCOT-FREE.
I GOT A WHUPPING.

26:19.083 --> 26:21.166
SAID I SHOULD'VE
BEEN KEEPING HER IN LINE.

26:21.166 --> 26:25.917
- WHAT ABOUT UNCLE CLAYTON
AND WYATT AND JERRY?

26:25.917 --> 26:28.583
- THERE WERE HIS FAVORITES.
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

26:28.583 --> 26:30.084
- JUST WANT US TO GET CLOSER

26:30.084 --> 26:31.583
SINCE WE HAVE LIMITED TIME.

26:31.583 --> 26:35.208
- LIMITED TI--
WE DO NOT HAVE LIMITED TIME.

26:35.208 --> 26:36.625
JESUS!
