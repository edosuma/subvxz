02:58.482 --> 03:02.448

Bitch, this is Madam.

03:02.448 --> 03:04.241
What the fuck she look like
laundering money

03:04.241 --> 03:05.793
for some lowlife street gang?

03:05.793 --> 03:08.724
- We have--we have an
informant saying that she was!

03:08.724 --> 03:09.827
- Who's the informant?

03:09.827 --> 03:11.724
- I don't know.
- Bitch!

03:14.206 --> 03:15.724
- Who's the fucking informant?

03:15.724 --> 03:17.448
- I don't know! I swear!

03:19.379 --> 03:21.206
- Turn her loose.
- Madam...

03:22.275 --> 03:23.827
- Put her down.

03:30.965 --> 03:34.275
- Thank you for your honesty.

03:34.275 --> 03:37.758
- Please call off the hit.
That's my husband.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.103
-Oh, honey.

03:39.103 --> 03:41.275
What kind of woman
do you think I am?

03:41.275 --> 03:43.379
There's no hit on your husband.

03:43.379 --> 03:46.965
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

03:46.965 --> 03:50.000
- Thank you! Thank you!

03:50.000 --> 03:53.862
-Girl, I run a
legitimate business, okay?

03:53.862 --> 03:56.724
I don't know what the fuck
you think you have on me,

03:56.724 --> 03:59.793
but I don't know anyone
from the Black Rock Boys.

03:59.793 --> 04:02.517
So I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

04:02.517 --> 04:04.758
- Okay, okay, well--
-What?

04:07.241 --> 04:10.379
- I wanna make a deal with you.

04:10.379 --> 04:14.827
- A deal?
- What she say?

04:14.827 --> 04:16.068
- Let--let me hear this.

04:16.068 --> 04:18.448
Okay, this should
be interesting.

04:19.620 --> 04:23.551
- Okay, we've been
watching your operations.

04:23.551 --> 04:24.551
- And?

04:24.551 --> 04:25.827
- There's a lot of shady shit

04:25.827 --> 04:28.000
going on around here
and around you.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.103
You have a woman that
we've really been watching.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.689
Her husband embezzles millions
of dollars, and we want her!

04:33.689 --> 04:35.310
- Then why the fuck
did you come in here

04:35.310 --> 04:37.586
with this Black Rock Boys
story, huh?

04:37.586 --> 04:40.517
- Look, I--I was just--
- Talk!

04:40.517 --> 04:42.172
- I begged them for
this assignment, okay?

04:42.172 --> 04:43.620
I'm a rookie.

04:43.620 --> 04:44.965
They didn't think I
was cut out for this.

04:44.965 --> 04:47.068
But all my life, I've
wanted to be an officer.

04:47.068 --> 04:49.862
- Eh, bitch, you done
chose the wrong damn side.

04:49.862 --> 04:54.896
- Don't blow my cover, please!
Give her to me.

04:54.896 --> 04:56.517
- Is she--is she--
- Asking me to snitch?

04:56.517 --> 04:59.379
Bitch, I'm not a
fucking snitch. No.

04:59.379 --> 05:00.965
- Who is her?

05:00.965 --> 05:02.689
- She calls herself Tandy.

05:02.689 --> 05:06.344
Her real name is
Lily Marie Watson.

05:06.344 --> 05:09.379
Will you help me?

05:09.379 --> 05:11.517
- I'm not a fucking
snitch, okay?

05:11.517 --> 05:14.103
- No, no. I mean, I--
- What?

05:14.103 --> 05:18.206
- Look, she has
a lot of local officials

05:18.206 --> 05:19.931
in her back pocket, okay?

05:19.931 --> 05:22.965
She runs drugs to their sons,
lawyers, judges, politicians.

05:22.965 --> 05:29.068
If you help me,
I'll let you guys go.

05:29.068 --> 05:30.655
- Let me go?

05:30.655 --> 05:33.068
- Did this bitch
just threaten you?

05:33.068 --> 05:34.137
- I feel like she did.

05:34.137 --> 05:36.482
- No, no! I swear! I swear!

05:36.482 --> 05:38.068
- Then what the
fuck are you saying?

05:38.068 --> 05:41.344
- Look, the men in my business
hate that I'm here, okay?

05:41.344 --> 05:43.689
I need to prove to them
that I can do this.

05:43.689 --> 05:47.758
- Well, that's dangerous.
- How so?

05:47.758 --> 05:50.517
- Baby, if you don't already
know, then I'm not telling you.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.172
- Will you give her to me?

05:52.172 --> 05:53.620
- What the fuck did
I just tell you?

05:53.620 --> 05:56.586
- Hear me out.

05:56.586 --> 05:59.413
If you get her to me,
I'll get a promotion.

05:59.413 --> 06:01.862
And I'll be sure
they leave you alone.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.310
- Bitch...

06:03.310 --> 06:05.448
- It could be good to have
the GBI in your back pocket.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.172
I can tell you everything
that's going on.

06:07.172 --> 06:09.137
- Get out of here.

06:09.137 --> 06:12.724
- Okay, or I can walk out of
here, go back to my office,

06:12.724 --> 06:15.793
and arrest you all for
what you have done to me.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.724
- Girl, bye.
- Will you consider helping me?

06:18.724 --> 06:21.793
- What the fuck did I just say?
Get the fuck out! Bye!

06:21.793 --> 06:24.241
- Girl, you don't take
your ass to that door...

06:24.241 --> 06:27.000
- Will you at least untie me?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.793
Wait, please!
Please! No, no, please!

06:37.655 --> 06:39.724
- How the hell she gon' think
that you be laundering money

06:39.724 --> 06:42.344
for some lowlife street gang?
- Blue.

06:42.344 --> 06:43.965
- They done lost
their fucking minds!

06:45.620 --> 06:46.827
Should've popped her ass off

06:46.827 --> 06:48.206
right there for that shit,
Madam.

06:48.206 --> 06:49.862
- Blue!
- No, Madam, I'm sorry.

06:49.862 --> 06:53.241
But you--them fucking thugs?
Fuck no!

06:53.241 --> 06:54.896
- Can I say something, please?

06:57.965 --> 06:59.206
I run that gang.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.965
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

07:05.965 --> 07:10.137
- You run Black Rock Boys?
- Yeah.

07:10.137 --> 07:13.758
Not out in front, but
that's my daddy's old crew.

07:16.517 --> 07:21.206
- What?
- Yeah.

07:21.206 --> 07:22.827
-Look,

07:22.827 --> 07:24.379
they don't know
my father, obviously,

07:24.379 --> 07:29.137
because they're too young.
So, I have someone in place.

07:29.137 --> 07:30.827
But all the money comes to me.

07:33.068 --> 07:35.034
- Madam...

07:35.034 --> 07:36.689
- You didn't think
I was making all this money

07:36.689 --> 07:38.241
off of dick and ass, did you?

07:38.241 --> 07:42.758
- You did.

07:42.758 --> 07:45.586
- You didn't even tell me.

07:45.586 --> 07:47.206
- Well, now you know.

07:49.413 --> 07:51.413
- All that money that's in here.

07:51.413 --> 07:54.551
- Exactly. It's from them.

07:54.551 --> 07:57.827
Niggas been hitting
it hard lately.

07:57.827 --> 08:00.103
Don't even have enough
room to put all the shit.

08:00.103 --> 08:02.862
All my banks are maxed out.

08:02.862 --> 08:06.172
That's why I'm trying to open
up more businesses, more clubs.

08:06.172 --> 08:09.482
Now that the Concierge family
wants more shit from me,

08:09.482 --> 08:11.275
we gotta get shit moving.

08:12.482 --> 08:16.344
- Damn, Madam.
- Yeah.

08:16.344 --> 08:18.689
- So you gon' take
their money too?

08:18.689 --> 08:20.068
- Look, Blue.

08:20.068 --> 08:22.379
Have you ever heard
of Griselda Blanco?

08:22.379 --> 08:26.034
- Nah.
- They called her the Godmother.

08:26.034 --> 08:30.827
She was the most
ruthless drug queen pin,

08:30.827 --> 08:33.862
before Pablo Escobar
and all that shit.

08:33.862 --> 08:37.827
She had billions in cash.

08:37.827 --> 08:40.793
That's what the fuck I want.
Billions.

08:40.793 --> 08:42.620
I'm not doing this shit
for a few hundred thousand

08:42.620 --> 08:45.000
and some red bottoms.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.172
I want the bigger
fucking picture, okay?

08:48.172 --> 08:51.310
I can make this shit happen.

08:51.310 --> 08:54.137
- Madam.
- What?

08:54.137 --> 08:59.448
- I just think you
got a good thing going here.

08:59.448 --> 09:02.551
- Look, I love my guys, okay?
I do.

09:02.551 --> 09:03.931
And we make great money.

09:03.931 --> 09:05.931
But this shit?
This the small picture.

09:05.931 --> 09:07.862
I want the big fucking picture.

09:07.862 --> 09:11.586
I'm playing at a
whole 'nother level now.

09:11.586 --> 09:13.862
Get with me.

09:13.862 --> 09:16.965
- So you gonna take
him up on his offer?

09:16.965 --> 09:18.413
- Call that sexy motherfucker

09:18.413 --> 09:20.620
and tell him to come
to my house.

09:20.620 --> 09:25.931
- Sexy?
- Yeah. Sexy.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.827
- I see you still in
that dangerous shit.

09:27.827 --> 09:31.034
- I love
the dangerous shit.

09:31.034 --> 09:33.758
You know that.

09:33.758 --> 09:37.068
- Then what about her?
You think she gonna talk?

09:37.068 --> 09:41.034
- Shemika? No.

09:41.034 --> 09:45.344
I saw something in her eyes that
I am sure will keep her quiet.

09:45.344 --> 09:49.275
- Mm, and what's that?

09:49.275 --> 09:51.275
- Greed.

09:57.448 --> 09:59.896
- Hey.
-What is it?

09:59.896 --> 10:01.724
- I need you to do
me a favor tonight.

10:03.172 --> 10:04.413
-What?

10:04.413 --> 10:06.689
- I need you to go to Club Eden.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.586
-That strip club?
Oh, hell no.

10:09.586 --> 10:11.241
I ain't giving them
niggas my money.

10:11.241 --> 10:15.103
- Girl, I got 200 for you to go.
-For real?

10:16.413 --> 10:17.724
- Yeah.

10:17.724 --> 10:20.137
-What you
want me to go for?

10:20.137 --> 10:21.724
- Hold on.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.965
I just want you to
scope the place out.

10:23.965 --> 10:26.793
-A'ight.
You paying, I'm there.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.586

10:49.931 --> 10:52.724

me to hook you up again.

10:52.724 --> 10:55.655
- Did you hear?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.172
- I told you I would

10:57.172 --> 10:58.172
- You did.

10:58.172 --> 10:59.793

10:59.793 --> 11:01.586
Don't forget about me.

11:11.793 --> 11:14.620

11:14.620 --> 11:17.379
Your, uh,

11:20.344 --> 11:21.793
- Okay.

11:21.793 --> 11:23.931
- Oh, okay?

11:23.931 --> 11:25.344
So you just cool with it, huh?

11:28.103 --> 11:31.965
- I ain't got nothin' to hide.
I told you I'm clean.

11:31.965 --> 11:35.137
- He said he clean.

11:35.137 --> 11:36.758
- I ain't hiding nothin'.
I am clean.

11:36.758 --> 11:38.517
- Oh, shit.

11:38.517 --> 11:41.517
Most niggas be runnin' around
here shaking like a crackhead

11:41.517 --> 11:44.172
when they waitin'
on these results.

11:44.172 --> 11:46.724
- Well, I'm not them.
- Oh, you different, right?

11:46.724 --> 11:49.344
You clean.
Let me tell you what, Amp.

11:49.344 --> 11:51.793
Get your clean ass downstairs
and vacuum the floor, then.

11:51.793 --> 11:53.206
- Do that.

11:53.206 --> 11:55.551
- I didn't realize y'all
was such good friends.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.275
Laughing and shit.

12:01.448 --> 12:03.000
- Punk ass.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.827
- Man, I can't stand
that motherfucker!

12:10.896 --> 12:13.068
- All right, what?

12:13.068 --> 12:15.448
- Because he always
just do what Paul say.

12:15.448 --> 12:17.034
He never complains.

12:17.034 --> 12:21.758
- You know, Red,
some people are good people.

12:21.758 --> 12:24.827
- I can't believe
you sayin' that.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.103
Out of all the people
we done seen here?

12:28.103 --> 12:30.724
- Hey, you know, he might
be the real one, period.

12:30.724 --> 12:32.482
Get over it.

12:32.482 --> 12:34.724
- Yeah, well, let's wait 'til
we get his drug shit back first.

12:34.724 --> 12:38.551
- Listen, that's gonna
be here any minute.

12:38.551 --> 12:42.379
- And I know the motherfucker
lyin' about dancing.

12:42.379 --> 12:45.724
- Hm. What did she say?

12:45.724 --> 12:48.482
- She goin'.
It's costing us 400.

12:48.482 --> 12:50.034
I had to give her 2.
- 400?

12:50.034 --> 12:53.034
- Yeah, and I gave her 2.
You need to give her 2 too.

12:53.034 --> 12:54.689
- Nigga.

12:54.689 --> 12:56.482
- I'm serious!

12:56.482 --> 12:58.172
- Do I look like a fool to you?

12:58.172 --> 13:00.000
- Bill, get the
hell out of my face.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.413
- That's some stupid shit.
That's--you made that shit up.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.034
- I want my money.
- No, you ain't gettin'--

13:03.034 --> 13:05.551
thinking about getting'
a dime from me, bruh.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.000
Shut your ass the fuck up.

13:13.448 --> 13:17.379
- Ms. Tandy.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

13:17.379 --> 13:21.862
- Madam, I wanted to talk to you
about possibly booking some of

13:21.862 --> 13:23.758
your guys this weekend.

13:23.758 --> 13:26.689
I'm throwing
a divorce pool party

13:26.689 --> 13:28.586
for one of my good girlfriends.

13:28.586 --> 13:30.724
I was thinking your dancers

13:30.724 --> 13:33.137
would add to the festivities,
you know?

13:33.137 --> 13:37.344
Give it that perfect touch.

13:37.344 --> 13:38.931
- Yes, I do.
- Hm.

13:38.931 --> 13:40.310
- I like the way you think.

13:40.310 --> 13:44.517
Well, all of my guys
are available on Sunday.

13:44.517 --> 13:45.689
- Sunday.
- Mm-hmm.

13:45.689 --> 13:48.724
- Hm. Works for me.

13:48.724 --> 13:50.793
- Okay. How long
will you need them for?

13:50.793 --> 13:53.000
Now, there is a
four-hour minimum.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.655
But if you guys are having
fun and they decide to stay,

13:57.655 --> 14:00.275
that's between you and them.

14:00.275 --> 14:03.172
- Mm, understood.

14:03.172 --> 14:06.551
Four hours will be
more than enough.

14:06.551 --> 14:11.137
- So how many do you want?
- All of them.

14:11.137 --> 14:13.551
Every single one
I've seen dancing here.

14:15.413 --> 14:19.379
- Okay. That's 250
an hour per dancer.

14:19.379 --> 14:22.379
Four-hour minimum, that's 1K.
Seven guys, that 7K.

14:22.379 --> 14:26.103
Three for the house,
that's 10 plus tips.

14:26.103 --> 14:29.034
- Cash or wire?
- Either are fine.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.965
Ms. Tandy, I know I
don't have to tell you this,

14:30.965 --> 14:32.655
being the generous
spender you are,

14:32.655 --> 14:34.413
but please remind
your girlfriends

14:34.413 --> 14:38.103
to take care of my guys.

14:38.103 --> 14:42.068
- Believe me.
They'll be well taken care of.

14:42.068 --> 14:45.103
- As always, it's been
a pleasure, Ms. Tandy.

14:45.103 --> 14:47.896
- Likewise, Madam.
Have a great afternoon.

14:47.896 --> 14:50.344
- You too.

15:05.172 --> 15:08.137
- You get all that?
- Already calendered.

15:22.241 --> 15:25.931
- You know I wasn't too sure
about you working at that club,

15:25.931 --> 15:28.413
given that you had
access to alcohol and all.

15:28.413 --> 15:30.034
-Oh.

15:30.034 --> 15:32.655
- I got the results
of your test back.

15:32.655 --> 15:34.275
- Okay.

15:34.275 --> 15:36.137
- You sound pretty
sure of yourself.

15:36.137 --> 15:38.586
A little cocky, if you ask me.

15:38.586 --> 15:40.758
- I know what it says already.
I'm clean.

15:40.758 --> 15:44.310
I haven't had weed or
alcohol in, like, nine years.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.586
- Well, make sure
it stays that way.

15:46.586 --> 15:48.931
'Cuz I will drag your ass back
to prison my goddamn self,

15:48.931 --> 15:51.517
understood?

15:51.517 --> 15:55.344
- Loud and clear.

15:55.344 --> 15:57.172
- Good job.

16:20.068 --> 16:22.965
- All right, fellas,
it's roll call.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.448
- What you got, mama?

16:24.448 --> 16:26.862
- I know you better not
be eating all that shit.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.586
- I'm good.

16:28.586 --> 16:31.034
- So fellas, I wanna talk to
you about what you guys saw

16:31.034 --> 16:33.172
the other night.

16:33.172 --> 16:35.068
- Yeah, what was that?

16:35.068 --> 16:38.448
- It was a chick.
And we call her Trouble.

16:38.448 --> 16:40.724
- Aw, shit.

16:40.724 --> 16:43.068
- Yo, chill with that.

16:43.068 --> 16:46.068
- I'm considering letting
her dance with you guys.

16:46.068 --> 16:47.931
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

16:47.931 --> 16:49.241
The women loved her.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.896
- So now we gotta
compete with her?

16:50.896 --> 16:53.620
- Hey, at least you ain't gotta
compare your dick to hers.

16:55.896 --> 16:58.827
- Damn, really?
- Yeah, really.

16:58.827 --> 17:00.931
-I'm not
asking you guys.

17:00.931 --> 17:04.172
I'm telling you
it's happening, okay?

17:04.172 --> 17:05.931
- Okay, so because
she's a chick,

17:05.931 --> 17:07.758
do we gotta be nice to her?

17:07.758 --> 17:10.137
- No, not at all.
You know I don't do that.

17:10.137 --> 17:11.655
- Okay.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.344
- Treat her exactly how
you guys are treated.

17:13.344 --> 17:15.655
- Okay. Here we go.

17:15.655 --> 17:18.758
- Yes. Here we go.

17:18.758 --> 17:20.137
- Shit.

17:21.551 --> 17:23.310
Sorry I'm late.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.862
- You see the way
they're lookin' at me? Hm?

17:28.827 --> 17:32.344
It's because you're late.
Now, since you're blood,

17:32.344 --> 17:35.103
they think I'm gonna
take it easy on you.

17:35.103 --> 17:36.620
- Are they right?

17:40.206 --> 17:42.620
- I'll decide the
next time you're late.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.517
- There won't be a next time.
I'm sorry. I--

17:44.517 --> 17:46.827
I went ahead and got with
Gabriel on the costumes.

17:46.827 --> 17:49.724
- And?
- And, um, Fuego.

17:49.724 --> 17:53.413
He ran me through all
the dance numbers.

17:53.413 --> 17:57.310
- Good.
Don't embarrass the blood.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.655
All right, fellas, let's
go make mama some money.

18:04.448 --> 18:06.758
- And Doc?

18:06.758 --> 18:08.931
We still need to talk.

18:08.931 --> 18:10.482
- Not much to say, but--

18:10.482 --> 18:13.724
- Great. I'll hear that
a little bit later.

18:13.724 --> 18:15.586
- Okay.
- All right.

18:39.965 --> 18:42.896
-- Ladies?
-- Yes!

18:42.896 --> 18:44.103
- If you're looking good--

18:44.103 --> 18:45.482
-Yes!

18:45.482 --> 18:47.758
- --and you're feeling good--

18:47.758 --> 18:49.379
-Yes!

18:49.379 --> 18:51.034
- --let me hear you
make some noise.

18:56.448 --> 18:57.655
- A'ight.

18:57.655 --> 19:00.172
We gonna slow it down.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.931
We gon' get a little sexy.

19:02.931 --> 19:05.586
We gon' get a little slow.

19:05.586 --> 19:09.793
And most of all,
we gonna get nasty.

19:09.793 --> 19:13.655
-Yes!

19:13.655 --> 19:15.275
- Raise a drink.

19:15.275 --> 19:17.172
Get your glasses up.

19:17.172 --> 19:19.517
And give it up.

19:19.517 --> 19:23.965
Welcome the men of Eden!

22:07.620 --> 22:09.206
- Hey.

22:09.206 --> 22:11.275
- What?

22:11.275 --> 22:12.689
- Hey.

22:12.689 --> 22:14.551
- Nigga, why are
you talking to me?

22:14.551 --> 22:17.000
- I just wanted to say hi.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.517
- Okay.

22:18.517 --> 22:21.655
- Um...I got a--I got a problem.

22:21.655 --> 22:23.827
- We all got problems, son.

22:23.827 --> 22:26.000
- I wanna--I wanna
file a complaint.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.931
- A complaint?

22:29.931 --> 22:32.724
- Yeah.
- Okay. Mm.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.586
You want me to go
to human resources?

22:34.586 --> 22:36.482
- Yes.

22:36.482 --> 22:38.896
- And what would you
like for me to tell them?

22:40.827 --> 22:44.310
- You was right.
Um, I think Jay drugged me.

22:44.310 --> 22:47.379
- Aww, did he, now?
- Yeah.

22:47.379 --> 22:50.551
- Mm. And how
do you know that?

22:50.551 --> 22:52.413
- Because he told me.

22:54.689 --> 22:57.793
- And you wanna
file this complaint?

22:57.793 --> 22:59.758
- Okay.

22:59.758 --> 23:02.827
- I--I'm gonna get human
resources on its way.

23:02.827 --> 23:04.827
- Oh really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:04.827 --> 23:05.931
Tommy?

23:13.241 --> 23:14.689
- Yeah?

23:14.689 --> 23:18.793
- Jay would like to
talk to human resources.

23:18.793 --> 23:20.103
- Word.

23:20.103 --> 23:23.448
- Yeah, you wanna file a
complaint against Freedom?

23:23.448 --> 23:24.896
- Yeah.
- For drugging him.

23:24.896 --> 23:29.896
- Hm. Okay.
I can help you with that.

23:29.896 --> 23:31.482
- Oh, great.

23:31.482 --> 23:32.827
- Go back with him
in the dressing room

23:32.827 --> 23:34.310
and he'll take
care of all of it.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.448
- What, right now?
- Right now.

23:36.448 --> 23:39.482
- Okay. Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome, baby.

23:39.482 --> 23:41.551
- I really appreciate this.
I like that.

23:41.551 --> 23:42.862
Thank you.
-Let's go.

23:42.862 --> 23:44.655
- Right back there.
- All right.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.310
- You look ready.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.758
- I'm ready to get
all this money.

24:04.758 --> 24:07.068
- Ah, you gotta get
through them guys first.

24:07.068 --> 24:08.793
- I got them.

24:08.793 --> 24:11.862
- Don't be so sure.
It ain't easy.

24:11.862 --> 24:13.137
- I got it.

24:13.137 --> 24:14.965
- I like your arrogance.

24:14.965 --> 24:16.965
Just be careful.

24:16.965 --> 24:18.517
- I hear you.

24:20.241 --> 24:23.517
Damn. Who is that?

24:23.517 --> 24:26.068
- Now, there's some women
you just don't mess with.

24:26.068 --> 24:27.724
- Why?

24:27.724 --> 24:29.965
- Her man is a dope boy
and that nigga don't play.

24:29.965 --> 24:33.206
Now, when her nigga
and his cockeyed brother

24:33.206 --> 24:34.517
come whoopin' that ass,

24:34.517 --> 24:37.103
don't come tell me
I ain't tell you so.

24:37.103 --> 24:39.965
- I'm--
I'm just, you know, going--

24:39.965 --> 24:43.137
why is she lookin'
at me like that, then?

24:43.137 --> 24:45.793
- Eh, she gon' give it to you.

24:45.793 --> 24:47.482
- For real?
- Yeah, see,

24:47.482 --> 24:51.482
they got, um, this
real fucked-up relationship.

24:51.482 --> 24:53.448
She likes to make him jealous

24:53.448 --> 24:56.137
and then watch him
beat the nigga's ass.

24:56.137 --> 24:57.482
- Oh, you playin' with me.

24:57.482 --> 24:59.620
- Nah. Go ahead
with your bad self.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.241
He's gon' whoop
that ass, this guy.

25:14.655 --> 25:16.793
- Did you not warn
her about her?

25:16.793 --> 25:19.827
- Now, you know I told her.

25:19.827 --> 25:24.000
- Oh. So she one of them.
- What?

25:24.000 --> 25:27.068
- She like to
learn the hard way.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.172
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:36.482 --> 25:39.482
- Madam, this is--
- Elisa.

25:39.482 --> 25:41.206
- Elisa.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.275
She would like to
see Anthony in the VIP room.

25:44.275 --> 25:46.758
- Oh. You like Amp?

25:46.758 --> 25:49.827
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:49.827 --> 25:52.000
Well, that's
$100 for the room.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.620
And then the dancer can
work out the rest of the money.

25:55.620 --> 25:58.206
- Okay.
- Jody, take her back.

26:00.896 --> 26:02.137
- Enjoy.

26:04.793 --> 26:08.068
- What you think that's about?

26:08.068 --> 26:10.448
- No idea, but that
bitch is broke.

26:10.448 --> 26:13.172
Look at her shoes.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.655
- You want me to warn him?
- Nope.

26:16.655 --> 26:18.275
He has to learn
one way or another.

26:18.275 --> 26:21.034
I mean, you know, I can't
do everything for him.

26:21.034 --> 26:22.241
- I gotcha.

26:36.241 --> 26:41.586
- So. What happened?

26:41.586 --> 26:44.000
- He--he drugged me.
- Say what?

26:44.000 --> 26:46.206
- Fuck you. This nigga
told me he drugged me.

26:46.206 --> 26:51.206
- Nigga!
- You told me!

26:51.206 --> 26:52.896
- Did you do that shit?

26:53.931 --> 26:57.827
- Yeah.
He said he wanted to relax.

26:57.827 --> 27:01.310
- So, you admit it?

27:01.310 --> 27:03.310
- Yeah, but he wanted it.

27:03.310 --> 27:06.034
- Okay.
- Piece of shit.

27:06.034 --> 27:08.000
- Let me file this complaint.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Nigga, what the fuck?

27:11.000 --> 27:13.034
- That's what the fuck
we do around here!

27:15.448 --> 27:17.172
Make a fist!

27:17.172 --> 27:20.103
- Ah...
- Nigga, make a fist!

27:20.103 --> 27:22.275
Hold it up!

27:22.275 --> 27:27.551
Now, I want you to
beat this nigga ass!

27:27.551 --> 27:29.965
I'm not fuckin' asking!

27:29.965 --> 27:33.758
- Hey. Um, that ain't--
that ain't me, man.

27:33.758 --> 27:36.758
- Okay.
- Aah!

27:36.758 --> 27:39.655
- That's for wasting
my fucking time!

27:39.655 --> 27:42.206
We do shit ourselves
around here!

27:42.206 --> 27:43.655
And you?

27:43.655 --> 27:47.310
You better get with
that individual shit!

27:47.310 --> 27:50.137
Get the fuck out and
don't come back here.

27:50.137 --> 27:53.620
You motherfuckers making
me burn my macaroni!

28:01.724 --> 28:04.137
- I'll getcha, bitch.

28:04.137 --> 28:05.827
I'll getcha.

28:07.448 --> 28:10.137
Oh, fuck.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.896
- Hi.

28:18.896 --> 28:20.758
- How did I do?

28:20.758 --> 28:22.620
- I wasn't watching.

28:22.620 --> 28:25.724
- Bullshit.

28:25.724 --> 28:28.689
- Okay. I was watching.

28:28.689 --> 28:31.620
- Okay. And?

28:31.620 --> 28:33.689
- You did great.

28:33.689 --> 28:35.172
- Thank you.

28:35.172 --> 28:40.517
- So, apparently,
you have a VIP.

28:40.517 --> 28:41.758
- What?

28:41.758 --> 28:43.551
- She wants a private dance.

28:43.551 --> 28:45.137
- Who is she?

28:45.137 --> 28:46.931
- I don't know.
She got in the VIP,

28:46.931 --> 28:50.068
so she must have big bucks
to be back there.

28:50.068 --> 28:54.655
- Uh...yo, I'm cool
on that, all right?

28:54.655 --> 28:56.827
- Why are you cool on that?

28:56.827 --> 28:58.655
- 'Cuz, shit, didn't
you tell me all the shit

28:58.655 --> 29:01.103
that goes on back there?
So, I'm good.

29:01.103 --> 29:04.896
- Okay, you good, but that
doesn't mean you have to do it.

29:04.896 --> 29:10.482
- I know, but, you
know, I'm just saying.

29:10.482 --> 29:14.068
- Okay, well, suit yourself.

29:14.068 --> 29:17.000
- What, you think that--
I get it, you think of that--

29:17.000 --> 29:19.689
- Oh, yes, yes, you think
I'm gonna judge you? Okay.

29:19.689 --> 29:22.793
- No, no, I'm just--you know,
I'm not like them other dudes.

29:22.793 --> 29:25.482
So I just want you to know that.
You feel me?

29:25.482 --> 29:27.172
- Okay, go and get your money.

29:27.448 --> 29:30.344
- Are you sure?

29:30.344 --> 29:32.482
- Boy, if you don't go and get
your money--I don't own you.

29:32.482 --> 29:35.206
I gotta spin this next record.

29:35.206 --> 29:37.068
But you should
change and freshen up

29:37.068 --> 29:39.793
before you go in there.

29:39.793 --> 29:42.103
- I smell pretty.

29:42.103 --> 29:43.551
- Go on--
- And don't think

29:43.551 --> 29:47.103
I don't see that you
got that attitude. Bye.

29:47.103 --> 29:49.034
- Bye, go do your thing.

29:51.586 --> 29:55.206
Ladies, this one is for you.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:11.793 --> 30:13.413
- I'm Amp.

30:13.413 --> 30:15.482
- I know you are.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.758
- Oh, okay.

30:17.758 --> 30:19.517
- Wait.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.275
You're nervous.

30:21.275 --> 30:25.000
- Uh, nah.
Nah, not at all. Yeah.

30:25.862 --> 30:27.862
- They tell me you new here.

30:30.758 --> 30:33.379
- Yeah, I am.
- And I like new blood.

30:35.310 --> 30:36.517
- Okay.

30:38.827 --> 30:40.448
- Let me see your dick.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.068
- Excuse me?

30:45.068 --> 30:47.482
- Nigga, I know you ain't shy.
This is a strip club.

30:47.482 --> 30:48.965
- Yeah, it--yeah.

30:48.965 --> 30:52.413
Um, I came here to dance
for you, you feel me?

30:52.413 --> 30:55.758
- You can't dance
with your dick out?

30:55.758 --> 30:58.241
- Uh...yeah, let me just,
you know,

30:58.241 --> 31:00.068
let me work up to it,
all right?

31:01.413 --> 31:04.310
- Here. Drink.

31:06.310 --> 31:08.551
- Uh, no, no.

31:08.551 --> 31:10.482
Um, I'm good.

31:10.482 --> 31:13.000
- You don't drink?

31:13.000 --> 31:14.724
- No, I don't.

31:14.724 --> 31:16.655
- You smoke?

31:16.655 --> 31:18.137
- No, I don't smoke.

31:18.137 --> 31:21.620
- Do you take your dick out?

31:21.620 --> 31:24.137
- Yeah, I mean, like I said,
let me, you know, work up to it.

31:24.137 --> 31:27.000
- Okay, okay. I see.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.620
- Yeah, see what?

31:28.620 --> 31:31.000
- You a good boy.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.172
Mama can deal with that.

31:33.172 --> 31:35.413
- Yeah?

31:35.413 --> 31:36.724
- Yeah.

31:36.724 --> 31:38.551
- You think?

31:38.551 --> 31:40.448
- Just dance.

31:40.448 --> 31:42.103
- All right.

31:48.379 --> 31:51.896
- I got a hundred
if you give me head.

31:51.896 --> 31:57.137
- Uh...um...I'mma just--

31:57.137 --> 31:58.862
I'mma just dance, all right?

31:58.862 --> 32:00.586
Cool.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.827
- Okay.
- Yeah.

32:02.827 --> 32:06.896
- Then I only got 20.

32:06.896 --> 32:08.655
- Okay. All right.

32:08.655 --> 32:10.137
Cool.

32:13.448 --> 32:15.448
- Mm!

32:32.482 --> 32:34.206
- Ooh.

32:41.413 --> 32:43.310
-Come in!

32:49.896 --> 32:51.965
- I didn't hear
from you last night.

32:51.965 --> 32:53.965
- She stood me up.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.620
- So she didn't call you back?

32:55.620 --> 32:58.103
- No.

32:58.103 --> 33:01.206
- Why do you think that is?

33:01.206 --> 33:03.655
- Maybe it was a setup.

33:03.655 --> 33:05.344
- Maybe.

33:05.344 --> 33:07.689
- I'm sorry.

33:07.689 --> 33:11.172
- Look, we do know we
have to find her, right?

33:11.172 --> 33:13.034
- Yeah, I do.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.413
- I don't like an
unstable bitch out there

33:14.413 --> 33:17.172
unless I have my eyes on her.

33:17.172 --> 33:20.137
- I understand.

33:20.137 --> 33:24.172
- All right. What the
fuck is wrong with you?

33:24.172 --> 33:26.172
- Whatchu talkin' about?

33:26.172 --> 33:27.965
- I'm talking about that look
you were giving upstairs.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.931
What's wrong? Hm?

33:30.931 --> 33:34.172
- It's crazy.
- What?

33:34.172 --> 33:36.413
- I gotta stop
hittin' these chicks.

33:36.413 --> 33:37.724
- What happened?

33:37.724 --> 33:40.586
- Teresa's friend showed
me a picture of a baby.

33:40.586 --> 33:44.034
It may be mine.

33:44.034 --> 33:46.896
- Do you think it is?

33:46.896 --> 33:49.172
- It look like me.

33:49.172 --> 33:51.965
- Well, all I'm gonna tell
you is find out, okay?

33:51.965 --> 33:53.413
- I got you.

33:53.413 --> 33:57.275
- Look, I have been
around a long time, okay?

33:57.275 --> 34:00.724
A kid does not deserve to
suffer because of your shit.

34:00.724 --> 34:02.551
- I got you.
- Find out.

34:02.551 --> 34:06.724
- I will. I got you.
- All right. You can go.

34:06.724 --> 34:08.793
- All right.

34:08.793 --> 34:10.724
Wait.
- Hm?

34:10.724 --> 34:12.000
- It's Tina right here.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.758
- Tina? Take it.
Put it on speaker.

34:14.758 --> 34:15.862
- Okay.

34:16.862 --> 34:18.413
Yo.

34:18.413 --> 34:19.965
-I'm sorry
about last night.

34:19.965 --> 34:21.931
- Look, get off my phone.

34:21.931 --> 34:23.793
-I want to see you.

34:23.793 --> 34:25.517
Please.
- Tina--

34:25.517 --> 34:28.655
-Please.
It's so lonely here.

34:28.655 --> 34:30.482
- You won't even
tell me where you at.

34:30.482 --> 34:32.379
-I'll tell you
right after you get off.

34:37.206 --> 34:39.413
- I'm not doing this shit.

34:39.413 --> 34:42.241
-I will text you.
I promise.

34:42.241 --> 34:44.206
- I gotta go.

34:51.103 --> 34:53.655
- So, what you think?

34:53.655 --> 34:55.896
- Same old bullshit.

34:55.896 --> 34:59.068
- All right.
Well, you keep me posted.

34:59.068 --> 35:00.931
- Okay.
- Thank you.

35:00.931 --> 35:02.620
- All right, thank you.

35:17.034 --> 35:20.137
- Thank you, as always.

35:20.137 --> 35:23.379
- You're welcome.

35:23.379 --> 35:26.137
- Hey.

35:26.137 --> 35:28.551
- Uh, uh, .

35:28.551 --> 35:31.413
Ms. Tandy left this for you.

35:31.413 --> 35:34.931
- Word?
- Yeah.

35:34.931 --> 35:37.137
- Whoa. I needed this.

35:37.137 --> 35:40.172
Is it the same woman who
left Midnight the TV?

35:40.172 --> 35:41.689
- Yeah.

35:41.689 --> 35:44.758
Uh, Madam mentioned to
me that you are invited

35:44.758 --> 35:50.137
to do a private party
this weekend at Tandyland.

35:50.137 --> 35:55.793
- Yeah, uh...I don't
know if I'm gonna go.

35:55.793 --> 35:58.655
- Well, uh, like I said, uh,

35:58.655 --> 36:02.344
those parties can get
pretty wild.

36:02.344 --> 36:05.482
I have seen everything
from cocaine and condoms

36:05.482 --> 36:08.344
to whips and bondage, so.

36:08.344 --> 36:12.655
- Oh, you mean, like,
some escort-type shit?

36:12.655 --> 36:15.655
Yo, if I do go,
I'mma just dance.

36:15.655 --> 36:19.241
Get my bread and dip, that's it.

36:19.241 --> 36:22.103
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:22.103 --> 36:25.896
I mean, you'll be DJing, right?

36:27.482 --> 36:29.206
- Maybe you can make sure
I don't get in any trouble?

36:29.206 --> 36:31.344
Keep an eye on me?

36:31.344 --> 36:33.620
- I'll keep an eye on you.

36:33.620 --> 36:35.827
- Okay.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.448
Yo, question.

36:38.448 --> 36:40.482
- Shoot.

36:40.482 --> 36:42.448
- You ever date any
of the guys here?

36:42.448 --> 36:44.206
- I told you, I
don't date strippers.

36:44.206 --> 36:45.655
- Oh, hold up, hold up.

36:45.655 --> 36:49.000
First of all, we
are not strippers.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.275
We are male exotic
dancers, a'ight?

36:51.275 --> 36:52.724
So you put some respect on it.

36:52.724 --> 36:54.448
- Mm-hmm.

36:54.448 --> 36:58.689
- And secondly, that's too bad.

36:58.689 --> 37:01.103
You might just be
blocking a blessing.

37:01.103 --> 37:02.724
- Boy, you ain't no blessing.

37:02.724 --> 37:05.413
- Aw, now, you haven't
seen that part of me yet.

37:05.413 --> 37:07.862
- Okay, well--

37:07.862 --> 37:09.620
- Well?

37:09.620 --> 37:12.517
- Maybe, just maybe, I
can make an exception.

37:12.517 --> 37:17.000
- Okay, well, well, maybe,
just maybe, you should.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.862
I mean, for real, dawg,
we got some good energy, right?

37:18.862 --> 37:22.517
So I'd like to see you
outside of here, you know?

37:22.517 --> 37:27.137
Take you out for a
bite to eat or something.

37:27.137 --> 37:29.000
- Are you asking me on a date?

37:30.517 --> 37:33.586
- Nah. I mean, it's just a meal.

37:33.586 --> 37:37.103
We ain't gotta put no labels
on it.

37:37.103 --> 37:38.827
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:38.827 --> 37:40.758
- I'd like that.

37:40.758 --> 37:44.482
- Good. Me too.

37:44.482 --> 37:46.000
- All right,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.724
it's getting late,
so I'mma head out, all right?

37:47.724 --> 37:50.413
- Yep, yep. Okay.

37:51.551 --> 37:55.448
- Yo.

37:55.448 --> 37:58.862
I'm looking forward to our date.

37:59.896 --> 38:01.827
- Good night, Dime.

38:01.827 --> 38:03.068
- Good night.

38:09.172 --> 38:10.551
Okay.

38:55.586 --> 38:58.689
- The next one
won't be in the air!

38:58.689 --> 39:00.379
And I'm sure
somebody heard that,

39:00.379 --> 39:04.310
so the cops will be here soon.

39:05.275 --> 39:07.482
- Are you okay?

39:07.482 --> 39:09.862
- I'm okay.
- You--you sure?

39:09.862 --> 39:11.068
- Yeah.

39:11.068 --> 39:12.931
- Come on, come on,
let's get you home.

39:14.448 --> 39:16.379
- Thanks.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.034
- Dime?

39:43.034 --> 39:44.689
- Hey, Madam.

39:44.689 --> 39:48.137
I figured you'd wanna know,
Amp got jumped tonight.

39:48.137 --> 39:50.137
- What?
-Yeah.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.482
There were three of them.

39:51.482 --> 39:53.310
I don't know who they were.

39:53.310 --> 39:54.620
-Is he okay?

39:55.689 --> 39:57.206
- He'll be all right.

39:57.206 --> 39:59.724
Just a few scratches
and scrapes.
